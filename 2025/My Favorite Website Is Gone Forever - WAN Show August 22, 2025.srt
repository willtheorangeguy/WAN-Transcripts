[0.00 → 13.56] What is up everyone and welcome to a fabulous WAN show where I have to tell you, I don't know whether I'm more angry or sad.
[13.56 → 33.82] Because the website that taught me so much of what I know about PCs and computer hardware and electronics and just an invaluable repository of knowledge of PCs and times past has gone dark.
[34.82 → 39.74] Gone dark in a way that was big preventable dark.
[39.74 → 43.82] And not that expensive to, well, we'll talk about it.
[43.98 → 45.26] We'll talk about it.
[45.32 → 47.74] But a non-text archive is gone.
[48.64 → 50.62] It just redirects to the forum.
[50.98 → 51.60] That's it.
[51.88 → 58.84] That's all she wrote, folks, in spite of their current owner, Perch, saying that that would, oh no, it's future PLC now.
[59.00 → 59.22] Yes.
[59.32 → 61.72] Sorry, future PLC saying that wouldn't happen.
[61.72 → 72.40] In other news, YouTube has responded to the criticism that Mr. Riley, who, I might note, never criticizes anything hardly.
[72.84 → 75.82] Okay, so this is a truly, two exceptional things happened this week.
[76.22 → 82.64] YouTube responded to our tech-linked criticism of the AI sharpening on YouTube shorts.
[82.64 → 91.30] So we'll get into it more later, but the spoiler here is they claim it's not AI, it's traditional machine learning.
[93.44 → 95.88] Yeah, that's what I said.
[96.04 → 97.24] What else we got this week?
[97.24 → 98.68] Where are we drawing these lines?
[99.38 → 104.76] I will be addressing some controversial threads about labs.
[104.76 → 107.48] I thought I'd give them a little...
[107.48 → 110.02] Can we not have a controversy?
[110.02 → 110.92] I thought that would be fun.
[111.10 → 112.36] For one week!
[112.48 → 113.80] I don't think it's going to be controversial.
[114.80 → 116.08] Why would you call them controversial?
[116.26 → 118.28] No, they're going to be extremely controversial.
[118.64 → 120.28] They're going to be brutal battles.
[120.28 → 121.22] Head of labs lies.
[121.28 → 126.66] I'm going to be sticking my flag in the ground.
[126.66 → 130.68] His flaccid ass non-controversy as controversial.
[131.24 → 132.80] It's going to be super serious.
[132.92 → 134.36] You guys stay tuned to check it out.
[134.36 → 136.52] Head of lies, says Pug boy.
[138.56 → 140.00] Yeah, yeah.
[140.20 → 141.28] I mean, sorry, whatever.
[141.44 → 147.36] Anyway, and Intel grabs $2 billion for a lifeline.
[147.56 → 149.58] Yeah, they grabbed it by the pussy.
[150.20 → 150.68] Whoa.
[158.80 → 159.48] Whoa.
[164.36 → 168.02] Wait, did I not eat that?
[169.36 → 170.14] Did you not?
[170.14 → 174.64] The show is brought to you today by Ground News, MSI, and Messi.
[174.90 → 179.90] Also with our rap partner, Brand, our laptop partner, Dell, and of course, our chair partner,
[180.42 → 181.94] Secret Labs.
[181.94 → 185.36] Why don't we jump right into our headline topic today?
[185.36 → 185.72] Okay.
[185.72 → 192.54] Which is, of course, that a non-text article archive has been taken down.
[192.86 → 193.68] I know.
[193.98 → 194.48] I know.
[194.70 → 196.24] This happened a couple of weeks ago.
[196.24 → 199.24] But I just found out this week.
[199.36 → 205.18] I was reviewing a script with, I think it was Proof and Nick from the lab.
[205.80 → 208.38] Really cool video we've got coming soon, by the way, guys.
[208.44 → 211.62] We finally got our hands on an NVIDIA H200.
[211.62 → 215.62] So, sure, yeah, it's their last gen one or whatever.
[215.90 → 218.24] But it's a $30,000 GPU.
[218.80 → 224.44] And we ran some machine learning and AI benchmarks and it fast.
[226.70 → 227.72] Very fast.
[228.12 → 232.90] It's like, it's so fast, I almost look at it and I go...
[232.90 → 233.82] Wow, it fast.
[234.02 → 234.46] Wow.
[234.68 → 235.36] Damn.
[235.44 → 238.32] My friends called me, and they were like, that's really fast.
[238.48 → 239.26] Damn, girl.
[239.26 → 239.38] Damn.
[239.38 → 245.12] You really fast at making slop.
[247.56 → 249.68] Nobody slops harder than you slop.
[252.10 → 253.12] I mean...
[253.12 → 257.82] But I mean it in a kind way, a respectful way.
[259.24 → 262.14] You could mean that respectfully.
[262.14 → 263.04] You a sloppy girl.
[263.04 → 265.04] You could...
[265.04 → 271.28] We're already so gone.
[272.78 → 277.14] We're like barely into any topics.
[277.52 → 279.08] We are so gone.
[279.08 → 284.86] Well, folks, it's been nice knowing you.
[287.12 → 288.36] Sayonara from Canada.
[289.40 → 290.12] Oh, boy.
[290.40 → 290.76] Okay.
[291.10 → 291.82] I'm on text.
[291.96 → 292.68] So, yeah.
[292.82 → 294.32] Our source is Reddit.
[294.54 → 296.24] Well, actually, our source is me.
[296.66 → 298.76] Because I discovered this live.
[298.92 → 300.64] I was trying to find out...
[300.64 → 301.40] Shoot.
[301.50 → 302.34] I forget what I was...
[302.34 → 304.34] I think I was trying to find out sort of...
[304.34 → 305.62] Ah, yes, I remember now.
[306.10 → 314.72] Because I seemed to recall that the first GPU that implemented HBM memory was the Radeon R600.
[314.94 → 316.14] That ended up not being true.
[316.50 → 319.38] The R600 did have a notable memory configuration.
[319.68 → 322.06] It used a ring bus and a 512-bit.
[322.22 → 323.98] Or it might have even been more than that.
[324.00 → 324.32] I forget.
[324.32 → 326.68] But it had some kind of fancy memory interface.
[326.80 → 327.52] It wasn't HBM.
[328.02 → 334.38] And so, we were talking about something to do with the HBM memory that's on that H200 GPU.
[334.80 → 334.96] See?
[335.28 → 336.90] I brought it all the way back.
[336.98 → 337.38] Yeah, he got it.
[337.38 → 337.58] Boom.
[338.10 → 339.70] And I was like, oh, yeah.
[339.78 → 340.66] Well, hold on a second.
[340.80 → 343.32] I thought HBM had like a reputation for...
[344.20 → 345.66] Was it for being really efficient?
[345.96 → 347.60] Or was it for being really inefficient?
[347.76 → 348.92] I couldn't remember which one.
[348.92 → 355.10] So, I was trying to find a non-text article on the Radeon R600.
[355.38 → 356.54] Or the R600 GPU.
[356.66 → 359.08] I forget what the actual name of the card was.
[359.50 → 360.70] Was it the 20...
[360.70 → 361.38] 20...
[361.38 → 362.80] 20-something?
[363.42 → 364.30] I can't remember.
[364.38 → 364.72] It doesn't matter.
[364.82 → 366.92] The point is, R600 was the code name.
[367.40 → 369.56] And I clicked through...
[369.56 → 370.00] 2900?
[370.48 → 371.34] Yeah, that's probably it.
[371.40 → 371.90] Yeah, that's the one.
[372.40 → 372.60] Wait.
[373.44 → 374.04] 2900XT.
[374.24 → 374.54] Is that...
[374.54 → 375.22] No, is that Hawaii?
[377.36 → 378.70] It's not even an AR overview.
[378.92 → 379.46] It's a snippet.
[380.02 → 380.32] Yeah, I know.
[380.40 → 380.86] That's the one.
[381.02 → 381.12] Yep.
[383.06 → 384.72] So, I clicked through the article.
[384.94 → 386.34] And it went to the non-text forum.
[386.86 → 390.94] Not like the forum thread discussing the article or anything like that.
[390.96 → 391.74] Like, that was a thing.
[391.86 → 392.72] But no, not that.
[392.78 → 393.64] Just to the forum.
[393.78 → 394.54] I was like, oh, what the heck?
[394.60 → 394.96] That's weird.
[395.82 → 399.26] Anyway, we found a second source on that page of results.
[399.46 → 401.02] And I was like, oh, okay.
[401.12 → 401.40] No.
[401.76 → 403.28] That card did not have HBM.
[403.80 → 407.54] It was actually the R9 Fury that was the first card to have HBM.
[407.54 → 408.74] And I was like, okay.
[408.90 → 411.86] So, I searched like R9 Fury efficiency.
[412.14 → 413.10] Because I...
[413.10 → 417.00] So, what happened was in my brain, I had...
[417.00 → 417.34] Oh, yeah.
[417.94 → 419.00] There were efficient...
[419.00 → 421.02] There was an efficiency conversation around HBM.
[421.02 → 424.34] But it turns out the efficiency conversation went both ways.
[424.66 → 427.70] So, the card overall was not terribly efficient.
[427.98 → 430.94] But the HBM itself was known for being efficient.
[431.06 → 433.26] And that was the little piece that I needed.
[433.52 → 435.94] And I was able to continue my script.
[435.98 → 439.72] Or at least I would have been able to if I wasn't busy grieving.
[439.72 → 445.56] Because when I was looking for information on the R9 Fury, I came across another historical
[445.56 → 448.48] Nantes article that was indexed in Google search results.
[448.58 → 450.60] And I clicked on it, and it went straight to the forum.
[452.46 → 453.88] And I was like, what?
[454.56 → 456.74] And they were like, you didn't know?
[457.72 → 459.18] And I was like, know what?
[460.58 → 463.44] Nantes is gone.
[463.44 → 473.24] I mean, it, I guess, shouldn't surprise me that much.
[473.54 → 477.10] Because, you know, when private equity firms say,
[477.58 → 478.96] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[479.10 → 479.98] Oh, you know, yeah.
[480.10 → 481.28] All the staff's gone.
[481.42 → 484.48] But we're going to leave the historical archive up forever.
[485.24 → 485.64] Indefinitely.
[485.82 → 486.90] I don't know if they said forever.
[487.10 → 491.16] But there was no indication that they were going to be taking it down.
[491.16 → 496.06] In fact, all the news that you can find about Nantes shutting down.
[496.26 → 497.74] In their potential defence.
[497.92 → 498.40] Well, hold on.
[498.62 → 499.56] We'll come to it.
[499.64 → 500.32] We'll come to it.
[500.36 → 500.96] Okay, okay, okay.
[501.08 → 503.36] But blah, blah, blah.
[503.60 → 508.16] So you can actually see there was a fair bit of conversation about it.
[509.32 → 512.58] And there's always a question.
[512.70 → 514.22] Nantes can breathe a sigh of relief.
[515.24 → 515.76] Ah, yes.
[516.12 → 520.26] For now, Nantes fans can breathe a sigh of relief.
[520.26 → 525.54] Smith, Ryan Smith, former editor-in-chief, writes that future PLC, a non-tax publisher,
[526.04 → 528.86] will keep the site's archive indefinitely.
[529.50 → 531.16] Well, see, there's...
[531.16 → 532.62] That, yeah, that wording.
[533.16 → 533.68] Yeah.
[534.36 → 536.32] Yeah, that wording, though.
[537.42 → 541.88] I bet you it is true that they will keep the site's archive indefinitely.
[543.34 → 545.00] Doesn't mean they'll keep it up.
[545.00 → 547.88] So this happened a couple of weeks ago.
[550.48 → 554.46] This is actually Nantes's second PE owner.
[554.78 → 557.70] So first was Perch, who I accidentally blamed for this earlier.
[557.82 → 558.30] Sorry, Perch.
[558.80 → 559.72] First was Perch.
[559.78 → 564.16] And then Future PLC bought, I believe, both Nantes and Tom's Hardware from Perch.
[564.84 → 565.52] If I recall correctly.
[565.52 → 566.36] They own Tom's Hardware now.
[566.44 → 566.74] I know that.
[566.74 → 567.74] Yeah, they definitely...
[567.74 → 570.52] Future definitely owns Tom's Hardware now as well.
[572.80 → 576.28] This flipping blows.
[576.48 → 583.98] However, I am going to present one unexpected defence of the move.
[583.98 → 587.76] I've seen...
[587.76 → 587.86] Yeah.
[588.60 → 592.76] Because I had one, and I lost it already, so I'm very interested in where...
[592.76 → 596.48] Because I was wondering, like, did that statement happen under Perch
[596.48 → 599.58] and then it was sold invalidating the statement?
[599.70 → 600.10] But no.
[600.24 → 601.60] So there goes my whole thing.
[601.64 → 602.30] Yeah, no.
[602.42 → 602.62] Sorry.
[602.76 → 603.48] Okay, what is yours?
[603.64 → 605.50] So here's my theory.
[607.18 → 608.78] That basically...
[608.78 → 613.52] Because I would think the cost of keeping this online for a company like Future PLC
[613.52 → 615.04] is, like, trivial.
[616.46 → 617.74] Especially with ads on the site, yeah.
[618.64 → 619.28] Unless...
[619.28 → 628.66] Unless AI crawlers are f***ING them by just, like, constantly hammering it.
[628.66 → 635.14] Which, again, I don't know how super likely it is because there's no new content
[635.14 → 638.32] being added to the site other than the forum, which they have left online.
[638.32 → 644.28] So I had, like, one kind of theory that maybe it was around, like, you know,
[645.54 → 649.80] saving this non-AI infected sort of pre-AI era.
[650.28 → 653.00] But then it's going to be part of so many repositories anyway.
[653.08 → 653.36] So, yeah.
[653.38 → 655.46] What I had planned was to present, okay, yeah.
[655.46 → 664.20] They're keeping their non-dirty, non-AI written, you know, IP to themselves.
[664.48 → 669.40] And they want to, like, license access to, you know, helping AIs understand computers
[669.40 → 670.76] and the history of computers.
[671.04 → 676.50] But then realistically, the entire business of harvesting and selling data sets,
[676.88 → 679.16] there's no way they don't already have all of this anyway.
[679.16 → 680.16] Okay, so...
[680.16 → 685.52] A lot of the internet's data was crawled before countermeasures were put in place.
[685.52 → 687.92] Future isn't private equity, technically.
[688.10 → 688.76] Yes, you're right.
[688.86 → 689.18] They are.
[689.28 → 691.14] They, like, actually operate and stuff.
[691.24 → 692.32] They're not just private equity.
[692.60 → 695.24] So I should not have necessarily bundled them in with that.
[696.92 → 699.02] They just behave like private equity.
[699.34 → 700.76] Yeah, I looked up their Wikipedia.
[701.86 → 702.34] Sorry.
[702.34 → 706.42] That's Canadian private equity.
[706.72 → 707.32] I'm kidding.
[710.78 → 711.92] Can I find this?
[712.00 → 712.66] Future US.
[713.14 → 714.34] Yeah, there we go.
[715.20 → 716.60] Is it actually just Future US?
[716.90 → 717.22] Oh, no.
[717.26 → 718.32] No, it's Future PLC.
[718.86 → 721.80] For the United Kingdom-based companies, see Future PLC.
[721.92 → 726.18] But Future US, it looks like, owns the magazine, maybe?
[728.46 → 730.58] Or at least that's how it's laid out on Wikipedia.
[730.92 → 731.44] Who knows?
[731.44 → 733.24] I just thought it was interesting.
[733.38 → 741.32] If you look up Future US on Wikipedia, their list of defunct titles is longer than their
[741.32 → 742.60] list of current titles.
[743.84 → 745.00] Current titles there.
[746.08 → 747.36] And defunct titles.
[747.60 → 748.34] Right at the top.
[748.62 → 749.26] Nantes.
[749.40 → 749.68] Wow.
[750.00 → 751.02] They own Nintendo Power?
[752.02 → 754.32] Well, they, you know, for a period of time.
[755.00 → 758.72] Yeah, but I mean, defunct, they probably still own the IP then, I would think.
[758.78 → 759.22] I guess.
[759.52 → 759.74] Yeah.
[759.74 → 761.84] Official Dream cast magazine.
[761.94 → 764.16] Okay, some of these probably didn't need to still be around.
[764.42 → 764.86] Yeah.
[766.60 → 767.00] Yeah.
[767.92 → 768.88] Total Movie.
[770.16 → 771.46] Skateboard Trade News.
[772.02 → 772.92] Men's Edge.
[773.14 → 774.78] CD-ROM today, I guess.
[775.00 → 777.54] Yeah, we could live without CD-ROM today.
[777.56 → 777.88] A little time limited.
[778.36 → 778.62] Yeah.
[778.78 → 779.92] Might have been cool for a while.
[780.02 → 780.22] Yep.
[780.60 → 780.82] Yep.
[781.20 → 781.88] Broadcasting cable.
[781.96 → 783.44] I can kind of understand that going down.
[783.44 → 785.54] I think they should bring back maximum Linux, though.
[786.04 → 787.28] I think the time is right.
[788.00 → 790.22] It might, you know, for a magazine?
[790.48 → 791.06] I don't know.
[791.64 → 791.92] Mm.
[792.78 → 793.18] Yeah.
[793.54 → 794.26] That's fair.
[795.24 → 795.84] That's fair.
[796.46 → 796.76] Yeah.
[796.76 → 796.88] Yeah.
[797.68 → 800.44] Um, so what are our options here?
[800.56 → 801.68] Some people have apparently...
[801.68 → 805.66] Okay, so Future US is wholly owned subsidiary of Future PLC.
[805.92 → 806.16] Yeah.
[806.30 → 806.54] Yeah.
[806.96 → 807.18] Yeah.
[807.18 → 813.12] So there is apparently an archive on, well, of all places, the Internet Archive.
[813.22 → 814.42] Who could have thought it?
[814.78 → 816.92] But my notes say, but it's not the same.
[817.10 → 818.46] Do you know what is...
[818.46 → 818.68] No.
[819.14 → 821.02] What is not the same about it?
[821.12 → 821.30] No.
[821.96 → 822.44] You don't?
[822.68 → 822.88] No.
[823.70 → 825.04] Is it not very navigable?
[825.16 → 826.32] That would be what I would assume.
[826.70 → 829.56] I'm also assuming if there are any tools, the tools wouldn't work.
[829.56 → 830.24] Hmm.
[833.60 → 834.86] So this blows.
[834.86 → 839.36] Um, and I mean, not just for me.
[839.48 → 844.34] Like, for me personally, it blows because I would often use historical articles from
[844.34 → 849.60] Nantes whenever we're making a video about something that's so old that we didn't exist
[849.60 → 852.02] yet as a publication to cover it.
[852.28 → 856.92] Like, we've been around so long now that unless something is very old, you know, I could refer
[856.92 → 860.52] back to our old video, and I'll be able to find a B-roll clip or two as needed, maybe
[860.52 → 863.88] a benchmark result as shoddily as it might have been obtained.
[863.88 → 865.20] Um, back then.
[865.34 → 873.42] But every time one of these old sites goes down and all the articles are lost, we lose
[873.42 → 874.80] a piece of history forever.
[874.80 → 880.50] Like, that whole the internet never forgets thing is turning out to be so not true.
[880.72 → 881.42] Oh, extremely so.
[881.52 → 887.62] The internet forgets more than the entire rest of recorded human history contains.
[887.62 → 891.52] I think largely because everyone said the internet never forgets for so long.
[891.58 → 899.74] So they trusted it as an archive, um, and a backup when it's, it's just a bunch of dudes
[899.74 → 900.24] computers.
[900.24 → 909.32] And part of the problem is that now, um, even knowing the internet totally does forget, and
[909.32 → 910.80] this is going to be an enormous problem.
[911.00 → 916.14] I don't know how we're going to fix it because it's not practical to back up the whole thing
[916.14 → 920.22] in its, in all its different permutations as it is ever-changing.
[920.22 → 928.56] And there's so much crap mixed in with the gems that are worth backing up that how do
[928.56 → 931.34] you, how do you surgically back up what matters?
[931.90 → 932.64] Especially now.
[932.84 → 934.22] Especially now.
[934.36 → 936.82] Imagine backing up all that AI slop.
[937.50 → 938.08] Right?
[938.08 → 938.36] Dude.
[939.26 → 939.54] Dude.
[939.68 → 939.92] Okay.
[940.02 → 946.48] So back to the H200, like you can generate AI slop images at a rate that is just, was
[946.48 → 948.00] mind-blowing to me.
[948.20 → 953.82] Like I already saw what I felt was pretty fast AI image generation when we, uh, when we checked
[953.82 → 959.90] out that 48 gig, 4090 card, uh, the one that we got from China where they're modifying the
[959.90 → 962.22] 24 gig cards, and they're putting double the memory on them.
[962.34 → 967.68] And I was like, wow, dang, you can fit like a so much model in this VRM, you know?
[967.68 → 970.44] And then we were playing around with the H200.
[970.58 → 973.06] That thing has 141 gigs of memory.
[976.64 → 977.44] 141 gigs.
[977.92 → 978.78] That's pretty nuts.
[978.94 → 981.60] Like right on, it's, it's right on the package.
[981.96 → 983.38] Like it's right on there.
[983.76 → 985.60] They stack the memory, sir.
[985.76 → 987.86] It's a really cool piece of tech.
[987.92 → 988.06] Yeah.
[988.14 → 990.74] Too bad it costs as much as a practical family vehicle.
[990.84 → 992.18] I just kind of meant HBM in general.
[992.34 → 992.82] Oh, sure.
[992.94 → 993.14] Yeah.
[993.20 → 993.44] Okay.
[993.68 → 993.88] Yeah.
[993.96 → 994.16] Yeah.
[994.28 → 994.56] Yeah.
[994.90 → 997.66] Well, I mean the HBM is a big part of the price of that.
[997.68 → 998.56] No, that's fair.
[998.80 → 999.04] Yeah.
[999.24 → 1000.38] I just think HBM is cool.
[1000.72 → 1000.94] Yeah.
[1000.96 → 1003.40] The yields on it apparently is a real challenge.
[1003.58 → 1005.36] That's why it has an oddball amount.
[1005.90 → 1006.66] 141 gigs.
[1006.94 → 1007.68] That is weird.
[1007.74 → 1007.90] Yeah.
[1007.98 → 1013.72] Well, that's because when you're stacking 12 memory dies, occasionally you might.
[1013.84 → 1014.26] Stuff goes wrong.
[1014.28 → 1014.52] Yeah.
[1014.56 → 1016.48] You might have something not quite so perfect.
[1016.64 → 1017.42] We'll get better at it.
[1019.02 → 1019.68] Uh, OOP.
[1019.84 → 1020.78] I clicked the wrong thing.
[1021.16 → 1021.74] What is this?
[1021.74 → 1022.14] Okay.
[1022.14 → 1023.30] Oh, okay.
[1023.60 → 1027.22] Well, I will let chat worry about their, their stuff there.
[1028.22 → 1034.58] In summary, maybe the reason has to do with protecting the IP from AI scrapers.
[1034.68 → 1040.38] Maybe the reason has to do with not being able to afford the monthly bill of keeping the
[1040.38 → 1040.82] site up.
[1040.94 → 1044.10] Maybe the decision has to do with pure apathy.
[1044.58 → 1047.32] Uh, whatever the reason is, this absolutely blows.
[1047.32 → 1052.22] Uh, I think I had started a thought earlier about how, uh, this affects me, but I think
[1052.22 → 1057.54] this affects, this affects, oh man, this affects anybody who wants to, you know, learn
[1057.54 → 1059.88] about stuff from a previous era.
[1060.10 → 1060.58] Yeah.
[1060.82 → 1061.92] Cause like, what do you, what do you.
[1061.92 → 1065.96] This was a very valuable archive for computer hardware history.
[1066.22 → 1068.10] And computer hardware enthusiasts.
[1068.58 → 1068.88] Yeah.
[1069.76 → 1071.14] This absolutely blows.
[1071.14 → 1078.44] And, um, in advance future PLC, I reject your offer to purchase Linus Media Group.
[1081.30 → 1081.74] Sure.
[1082.12 → 1082.44] Okay.
[1083.24 → 1085.48] Well, because they're, they're, they're going to mess it up.
[1086.94 → 1088.60] You don't know that they're going to offer though.
[1088.80 → 1091.36] I don't, but in advance, I reject their offer.
[1091.36 → 1091.64] Sure.
[1091.74 → 1092.10] Okay.
[1092.58 → 1093.66] I'm being proactive.
[1093.88 → 1094.88] You should learn about it.
[1098.74 → 1100.98] I was, I would more lean towards vain.
[1101.14 → 1104.72] But you know why not both?
[1105.22 → 1106.08] Fair enough.
[1109.66 → 1116.16] Uh, if this is a potentially odd call out, but if you want a cool, uh, experience talking
[1116.16 → 1121.20] about the closure of an old magazine, uh, there's a podcast that they really haven't
[1121.20 → 1123.54] made enough episodes of, but it's called the life well wasted.
[1123.68 → 1128.46] And I think it's their first episode ever is the death of EGG or electronic gaming monthly.
[1128.46 → 1134.16] And it's like, he, he goes and interviews a bunch of the people, uh, at their, I think
[1134.16 → 1138.52] it's like their like last day or at a party where it's like the, the closure of the company
[1138.52 → 1138.88] party.
[1139.08 → 1141.20] And it's, it's actually really wild.
[1141.20 → 1143.94] Because they're talking about like the death of magazines.
[1143.94 → 1148.16] And it's a bunch of people that had worked at a bunch of different magazines and ended
[1148.16 → 1149.78] up eventually over time to EGG.
[1150.00 → 1153.90] Cause EGG was one of the later ones to go down in regard to gaming magazines.
[1154.54 → 1157.62] It's actually like a perfect episode, but right.
[1157.66 → 1161.68] Cause these are the last ones left standing in the industry effectively.
[1161.68 → 1162.08] Yeah.
[1162.24 → 1167.36] And they, they talk about like what it was like to write video game reviews back when
[1167.36 → 1169.64] like the internet wasn't a thing.
[1169.72 → 1171.98] This is a lot of like old head game reviewers.
[1172.24 → 1174.68] It's, it's actually like, it's a really, really cool episodes.
[1174.68 → 1176.96] And it's from a podcast that like not a lot of people know about it.
[1176.96 → 1177.84] And it's fantastic.
[1178.26 → 1183.24] Um, I was talking to Been exists in flow plane chat, who is apparently an employee, Nine,
[1183.40 → 1183.88] Nine.
[1184.02 → 1184.30] Sure.
[1184.60 → 1186.76] Uh, apparently employee of future PLC.
[1186.78 → 1189.50] And I was asking, cause like the, the timing of this is kind of funky.
[1189.50 → 1191.56] We haven't, we haven't necessarily gotten to this portion of it yet.
[1191.90 → 1197.86] Um, but it's, and I don't, I don't have a hundred percent know, but it seems like bench, uh,
[1197.98 → 1203.88] the Tom's hardware tool bench, uh, was maybe launched at a fairly similar time to when
[1203.88 → 1204.80] an Aztec went down.
[1205.80 → 1206.20] Oh.
[1206.86 → 1210.88] And it feels like there's potentially a strategy there to try to get more people coming towards
[1210.88 → 1211.26] bench.
[1212.66 → 1213.06] Right.
[1213.24 → 1214.00] Do you know what I'm talking about?
[1214.10 → 1215.06] Yeah, no, I know what you're talking about.
[1215.06 → 1219.48] So bench is their, um, their comparison tool where you can kind of compare a
[1219.48 → 1223.84] across brands, across eras and see relative performance.
[1224.16 → 1231.98] And a non-tech had a lot of historical graphs and charts, um, that I get either they've rolled
[1231.98 → 1235.54] in, which I don't, I don't actually know how they obtain all the results for bench.
[1235.64 → 1240.56] I don't know if they've, uh, used any of the non-tech data, but what they might be avoiding,
[1240.56 → 1243.02] I guess, to your point is people just.
[1243.20 → 1244.14] Using a non-tech.
[1244.14 → 1247.92] Like, going back and just looking at graphs on there.
[1247.92 → 1248.36] Oh, never mind.
[1248.46 → 1249.70] He's a very ex-employee.
[1249.78 → 1250.12] My bad.
[1250.68 → 1254.50] Um, but yeah, apparently there wasn't like a...
[1254.50 → 1254.64] She.
[1254.64 → 1254.76] She.
[1254.76 → 1256.16] I don't know.
[1256.24 → 1257.76] Are you going to get anything right today?
[1257.86 → 1257.96] No.
[1257.96 → 1259.72] Are you just going to go full, like...
[1259.72 → 1260.34] Yeah, that.
[1260.68 → 1263.10] Except for apparently I'm not going to say it this time for some reason.
[1263.24 → 1266.92] So the time that I get it all wrong, I'll omit the statement.
[1267.18 → 1267.46] Perfect.
[1267.46 → 1271.22] Um, but yeah, I don't, I don't fully know how this tool works.
[1271.30 → 1275.58] I wanted to poke into it, and then I realized that they, they only have yearly subscriptions
[1275.58 → 1276.64] as far as I can tell.
[1276.86 → 1280.70] And it's 70 bucks a year, and I was too cheap.
[1282.52 → 1288.88] But yeah, so that, that, so that's the closest I've seen, I guess, is this.
[1292.28 → 1292.72] Hmm.
[1293.38 → 1293.80] Okay.
[1294.02 → 1296.24] Who would pay for a subscription to this, you think?
[1297.46 → 1305.12] Interesting question because Dan Siegel, the like head of the labs website and I were
[1305.12 → 1307.84] looking at this, and he asked that.
[1308.88 → 1309.28] Yeah.
[1309.40 → 1314.32] And I was like, I don't know, but I think you get more than just bench.
[1315.08 → 1315.48] Okay.
[1315.48 → 1319.20] Because I think it's the Tom's Hardware premium subscription.
[1319.46 → 1320.24] So it's not just bench.
[1320.32 → 1321.20] I think you get other stuff.
[1321.28 → 1321.58] Okay.
[1322.02 → 1322.42] I don't know.
[1322.46 → 1322.76] Like what?
[1322.98 → 1323.44] I don't know.
[1323.44 → 1328.68] You get premium exclusive features and interviews.
[1328.88 → 1333.26] You get expert news analysis and roadmaps, and you get bench.
[1334.20 → 1334.68] Okay.
[1334.78 → 1336.22] The power of our bench database.
[1336.36 → 1339.18] And it's Tom's, and they have the Annan tech data.
[1339.28 → 1345.10] So they probably have an incredible amount of data in bench to, to, to, you know, to back
[1345.10 → 1350.38] them up, man, it's got to be a tough time to be Tom's hardware.
[1352.82 → 1357.14] I think it's got to be a tough time to be any form of written media, to be completely honest.
[1357.68 → 1358.00] Yeah.
[1358.08 → 1364.12] Like I, um, to be clear, I'm not like, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to super dunk
[1364.12 → 1364.52] on them.
[1364.66 → 1364.86] Nope.
[1364.86 → 1370.42] I do understand that it is legitimately hard times in the written media industry.
[1371.22 → 1381.64] Um, but I just, it's going to be even worse when Tom's hardware eventually goes down if
[1381.64 → 1382.26] it ever does.
[1382.50 → 1383.16] I don't even know.
[1384.42 → 1388.00] Cause like, or don't like Tom's hardware, you know, or whatever.
[1388.00 → 1394.48] However, it's again, an extremely important perspective on PCs.
[1394.62 → 1400.00] You also, we, we also remind you of another site that unfortunately is.
[1400.16 → 1400.30] Yeah.
[1400.48 → 1400.74] Yeah.
[1400.82 → 1401.30] No more.
[1401.48 → 1404.90] It's, it's, it's that thing we always say.
[1405.02 → 1406.38] Wait, is PC perspective still live?
[1406.38 → 1406.80] Still live?
[1406.86 → 1407.76] Oh, they are still live.
[1407.78 → 1410.08] I thought it's like a new kind of deal, you know, now.
[1410.44 → 1410.82] Yeah.
[1410.84 → 1411.46] Look at this.
[1411.70 → 1412.50] You know what?
[1412.70 → 1414.36] PC perspective is still publishing.
[1414.64 → 1416.36] So I am the problem.
[1416.80 → 1416.98] Yeah.
[1416.98 → 1417.54] Not PC.
[1417.54 → 1417.88] Yeah.
[1418.42 → 1420.26] I am the problem for not reading.
[1420.52 → 1420.82] Yeah.
[1421.08 → 1421.64] Linus.
[1422.20 → 1422.76] Ugh.
[1422.88 → 1423.56] Oh my God.
[1423.60 → 1424.36] This is rough.
[1425.10 → 1426.46] There is one comment.
[1427.78 → 1429.04] You know what, Jason?
[1429.92 → 1430.78] Good job.
[1430.80 → 1431.70] Good job, Jason.
[1433.00 → 1434.40] Keeping the dream alive.
[1436.94 → 1443.42] I do find that there's, there are a lot of review sites that I found often don't get very
[1443.42 → 1447.32] much interaction like at all, but they've been around for a long time.
[1447.32 → 1451.30] So I don't necessarily know that like maybe the readers just aren't super interactive.
[1453.20 → 1453.80] I don't know.
[1453.86 → 1453.98] Sure.
[1454.06 → 1454.74] Let's hope for that.
[1454.80 → 1458.46] Like I know of a site that has like a hundred employees and I don't see a ton of comments.
[1459.14 → 1460.88] They've got to be making money somewhere.
[1461.58 → 1463.02] Parallelogram says, answer the question.
[1463.02 → 1463.80] If you know the answer.
[1463.80 → 1468.94] The question was specifically directed to the writer of the article about something they
[1468.94 → 1470.26] said on a podcast recently.
[1470.58 → 1474.42] So I don't think I'm going to be able to answer it.
[1474.42 → 1478.90] Hello train.
[1479.70 → 1481.88] Um, yeah, I don't know.
[1481.96 → 1489.96] It's all, it's a little sticky, but I, it would make the, the timing is a little bit
[1489.96 → 1496.12] fishy to me, but, um, what would prevent us from having something bench alike for people
[1496.12 → 1496.84] to do comparisons?
[1497.10 → 1497.68] We have something.
[1497.82 → 1498.26] I know.
[1498.40 → 1502.12] Oh, I was trying to not use this.
[1502.16 → 1503.16] I was throwing up a ball.
[1503.28 → 1504.98] I was trying to do was hit it.
[1504.98 → 1506.94] I was trying to just had to hit it.
[1508.26 → 1509.68] Why can't you hit the ball?
[1510.42 → 1511.88] I feel like I'm talking to my kids.
[1512.30 → 1513.52] Just hit the ball.
[1513.68 → 1515.50] No, I don't talk to them like that.
[1515.82 → 1520.42] I was trying to not use the, um, timing.
[1520.62 → 1520.76] I know.
[1520.80 → 1521.46] I'm not going to say it.
[1521.70 → 1522.24] I'm not going to say it.
[1522.30 → 1522.52] Why not?
[1522.52 → 1524.26] You can totally announce you're pregnant at a funeral.
[1528.22 → 1529.12] One life gone.
[1529.20 → 1530.08] Another life begins.
[1530.12 → 1531.74] That's a cycle of life, baby.
[1531.86 → 1532.58] Oh my God.
[1532.58 → 1532.86] Okay.
[1532.86 → 1536.00] So we, we have, so you can take like, Hey, look, I have a keyboard.
[1536.20 → 1538.66] I have another keyboard, or I click compare on both of them.
[1538.76 → 1539.74] I click comparison bin.
[1539.84 → 1541.20] I click view detailed comparison.
[1541.20 → 1542.96] And then I have all my different things.
[1543.54 → 1546.34] Uh, we have this, you can see, Oh, no data available.
[1546.34 → 1547.54] Because we tested different stuff.
[1547.64 → 1547.94] Hooray.
[1548.30 → 1551.34] Uh, there's, there's, you know, it's a work in progress.
[1551.48 → 1552.04] It'll take time.
[1552.04 → 1555.30] Um, but you can, you can compare things on the site.
[1555.62 → 1558.90] Um, but it will take in the longer term.
[1559.12 → 1563.84] Our aspiration is still to, to collect historical data.
[1564.00 → 1572.84] However, I can already without even, without even having tried to do it yet, foresee what
[1572.84 → 1578.46] will be some major challenges in collecting historical data for historical hardware.
[1578.46 → 1584.74] If we go back too far, because there is going to be the very, very old stuff that I think
[1584.74 → 1587.80] will be relatively straightforward to gather data on.
[1587.84 → 1595.56] But I'm not sure if anyone cares how well, you know, uh, uh, uh, a Radeon 9800 Pro runs
[1595.56 → 1597.14] to Quake 3 or whatever.
[1597.14 → 1597.58] Right.
[1597.62 → 1600.88] Like, I don't think that's probably going to matter to most modern gamers.
[1601.08 → 1602.98] And then there's going to be all the modern stuff.
[1602.98 → 1607.20] That's no problem because it runs on the latest operating system, and we can use the latest tools
[1607.20 → 1607.96] to monitor it.
[1607.96 → 1617.00] And then there's going to be this dead zone in the middle where the transition to steam
[1617.00 → 1621.42] was kind of happening and game discs like existed.
[1621.96 → 1627.30] But going back now and trying to find what was the kind of the final patch for that game.
[1627.30 → 1633.62] And then once it transitioned to like a steam key, uh, running that on an operating system
[1633.62 → 1636.14] that actually necessarily supports it.
[1636.30 → 1641.00] Um, cause like you can't, you can't install like steam on Windows Vista anymore.
[1641.64 → 1645.70] So if it runs in compatibility mode on a newer OS, like that's great.
[1645.70 → 1648.98] But was that performance actually equal?
[1649.24 → 1653.54] Can I find a GPU driver for that new operating system?
[1653.54 → 1654.26] It gets weird.
[1654.56 → 1659.20] And to be clear, uh, I just had a bin from like a previous show selected, which is why
[1659.20 → 1660.08] that didn't really work.
[1660.10 → 1662.54] Because we had like a high-end GPU against an extremely high end one.
[1662.58 → 1663.28] So we had different tests.
[1663.36 → 1665.96] This is what like a power supply would look like when things are actually comparable.
[1666.18 → 1670.70] So you can see, you get down to the charts, and you can see like on this one, the blue
[1670.70 → 1675.58] line is the fusion 1600 and the red line is the FSP 1650.
[1675.74 → 1680.22] You can see all the comparatives, and it's like, it's actually a very useful and powerful tool.
[1680.22 → 1684.12] Um, on the I think it's published now.
[1685.12 → 1690.04] I always get lost in between what's published and what's on the beta site because we're working
[1690.04 → 1693.60] on things, but there should be brought your own price capabilities.
[1694.16 → 1696.12] Um, at least coming soon.
[1696.56 → 1698.08] Let's look at these two.
[1698.58 → 1700.00] Add these two to the bin.
[1700.50 → 1701.80] Do the comparison bin.
[1701.84 → 1703.64] Because we were talking about bring your own price a while ago.
[1703.66 → 1706.50] So I wanted to see Dan Siegel is going to be screaming at me.
[1706.50 → 1706.94] Oh yeah.
[1707.10 → 1707.82] Add prices.
[1708.06 → 1714.64] So let's say this one is $420 and this one is a $469.
[1715.64 → 1717.36] I see a little price updated.
[1717.52 → 1718.74] You can select your currencies.
[1719.16 → 1721.38] You can undo changes.
[1721.58 → 1722.80] You can close that box.
[1722.80 → 1725.60] Then you can see your price performance live.
[1725.80 → 1728.42] So you can input like, this is what it actually costs me.
[1728.42 → 1735.70] Um, now this is, this is, uh, what I would call still in, in kind of production of sorts
[1735.70 → 1740.08] because we want to add some flags warning people like you should consider full system
[1740.08 → 1741.76] cost and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1742.04 → 1743.44] Um, but we're trying to get it out there.
[1743.52 → 1744.78] We're trying to get more.
[1745.36 → 1745.74] Yeah.
[1745.76 → 1748.62] And you can edit prices and then just disable them and go back to the performance graph,
[1748.70 → 1754.00] but we're trying to get more, um, useful tools on the site.
[1754.00 → 1758.12] And a big part of where we're going to get those, at least in the near future is through
[1758.12 → 1758.58] pricing.
[1758.90 → 1762.06] Because we found that we have a bit of a problem where there's a lot of information on the lab
[1762.06 → 1767.32] site, but because there's no pricing involved, it makes it hard to get to your final decision
[1767.32 → 1768.38] while there.
[1768.80 → 1772.24] Um, so we're trying to start integrating pricing into stuff.
[1772.66 → 1777.92] And we're hoping if anyone from, you know, any major, major electronics retailers is watching,
[1778.08 → 1781.58] feel free to kind of reach out through our public inboxes.
[1781.58 → 1785.70] Um, if we could get API access, that would be great.
[1786.02 → 1795.00] And if we can't get API access, well, um, I would never publicly declare that we're just
[1795.00 → 1796.42] going to scrape your site.
[1798.02 → 1799.64] I would never do that.
[1799.64 → 1805.52] But what I will say is that why don't we just work together, and you can get us API access
[1805.52 → 1806.32] to your pricing.
[1806.32 → 1811.20] And then we can provide a really super useful service to people who are shopping for the
[1811.20 → 1813.58] products that you sell, and it'll be great.
[1813.58 → 1817.96] And there will be synergies for all that seem like a fair way to put it.
[1818.20 → 1818.62] Sure.
[1818.86 → 1819.14] Yeah.
[1819.56 → 1824.64] I also will use this period of time to jump to another section that I was planning on talking
[1824.64 → 1829.94] about, uh, which is that there are, uh, you know, negative labs things that the community
[1829.94 → 1831.06] has called this out for recently.
[1831.22 → 1833.38] And I wanted to actually highlight those.
[1833.80 → 1837.22] Um, there's, there are two particular ones that I have right now.
[1837.22 → 1840.52] It's not like there are, have never been other ones to be clear, but there's two particular
[1840.52 → 1841.14] ones right now.
[1841.54 → 1849.06] Uh, on the mouse review Subreddit, there's a thread, um, which is LTT lab has tested the
[1849.06 → 1854.88] in zone mouse a, uh, and then somebody points at it and points out some potential issues,
[1854.88 → 1856.48] uh, with various things.
[1856.68 → 1860.40] And the main thing that I want to highlight here is that Lucas responded.
[1860.58 → 1864.94] So Lucas is in here talking about the mouse review, uh, oops.
[1865.50 → 1870.72] And he talks about like, okay, there was a detected human error, which we, we fixed right
[1870.72 → 1871.58] away upon seeing this.
[1871.64 → 1872.56] Thank you for pointing that out.
[1872.84 → 1875.66] Uh, it was the wrong data was selected from the dataset.
[1875.66 → 1881.18] So, uh, we, we fixed that, uh, there will always be some amount of human error with the
[1881.18 → 1881.50] lab.
[1881.96 → 1885.22] I apologize for that, but we are currently still humans.
[1885.22 → 1886.94] So it will currently still happen.
[1887.34 → 1893.00] Um, and we appreciate when people pointed out because we want the most accurate set of
[1893.00 → 1894.74] data we can have to live on the site.
[1894.84 → 1899.02] So if we, if we do screw something up, please tell us and we would love to fix it.
[1899.36 → 1901.06] Um, so thank you for pointing that out.
[1901.06 → 1906.66] And there's also like, we want to generally have a fairly open dialogue with people about
[1906.66 → 1907.78] what's happening in the lab.
[1907.78 → 1912.58] I owe Linus a video to go on the LTT channel to update what kind of what's going on with
[1912.58 → 1912.90] the lab.
[1913.06 → 1914.08] There's been a lot of updates.
[1914.30 → 1916.64] Uh, you guys are going to see a lot of new faces.
[1916.64 → 1918.56] You're going to see a lot of new desk layouts.
[1918.56 → 1925.08] You're going to see, um, a lot of new aspirational things for the future.
[1925.08 → 1930.84] We're trying to, we're trying to talk less and let the action do the talking, but I think
[1930.84 → 1936.00] we've kind of let the pendulum swing a little bit too far the other way.
[1936.14 → 1938.44] And we just haven't really been talking about it at all.
[1938.68 → 1938.88] Yeah.
[1938.96 → 1940.54] Time to talk about it a little bit more.
[1940.76 → 1944.02] Uh, but a lot of what we're going to be talking about is some of the things that we've been
[1944.02 → 1946.20] doing to try to increase transparency things.
[1946.20 → 1952.18] So like in this post, in this reply from Lucas, he mentions, uh, regarding the transparency
[1952.18 → 1953.06] on our testing method.
[1953.06 → 1955.26] We have a written article on how we test mice.
[1955.58 → 1960.60] Uh, and we explicitly note in the product pages when we differ from it for a special
[1960.60 → 1962.90] feature, I can appreciate how it may be missed.
[1962.92 → 1967.68] If you're not looking for it, would it be helpful if this was linked, um, linked from
[1967.68 → 1968.96] each mouse product page?
[1969.00 → 1972.78] So if we, if we called it out in each mouse product page, the reason why this is a question
[1972.78 → 1975.06] is because we actually want to hear from you.
[1975.10 → 1980.22] So like we, we want this type of criticism and feedback, and we want to use it to make ourselves
[1980.22 → 1981.22] better.
[1981.22 → 1985.72] And, uh, hopefully I'm trying to point this out because people might see Lucas's response
[1985.72 → 1988.00] and then actually reply to it and give us that information.
[1988.50 → 1995.40] Um, that is also true about the, uh, LTT's AI benchmarks cause me pain thread.
[1995.40 → 2000.00] Um, I don't know why this is his handle, but this is Nick from the lab.
[2000.20 → 2003.42] His handle is puzzle headed dish two 30.
[2003.92 → 2009.22] Um, I, Lucas's is a little bit more straightforward, but this is actually Nick.
[2009.22 → 2014.78] Um, and he basically talks about like, Hey, look, the, the, you know, we've had some problems
[2014.78 → 2015.18] in the past.
[2015.26 → 2017.56] We're constantly working on our, on our AI testing benchmarks.
[2017.64 → 2020.12] That is something that we've been very actively working on lately.
[2020.12 → 2021.86] So they'll change and improve going forward.
[2021.86 → 2026.64] Um, and he points out like, Hey, the stuff that we do have does address some of the points
[2026.64 → 2027.38] that you brought up.
[2027.38 → 2031.52] But again, there are new versions coming, and we're working on it actively.
[2031.52 → 2033.18] So we're not trying to say it's perfect or anything.
[2033.18 → 2035.38] Um, but, but that's where we're at.
[2035.38 → 2041.76] And I would also point out that we have been rather active in this area of the site, the
[2041.76 → 2046.00] from the lab is, is also sometimes referred to as the blog or just posts.
[2046.46 → 2050.74] Um, you can see like USB-C, how we conduct, uh, charge testing.
[2050.98 → 2053.44] Uh, you can see the power supply testing method update.
[2053.44 → 2054.40] That was perfect.
[2054.78 → 2058.96] Um, we promised these lines mean something new audio testing method.
[2059.04 → 2062.96] We're trying to publish posts talking about what we're doing.
[2063.18 → 2066.50] How we're doing it, why we're doing it and asking for feedback.
[2066.50 → 2071.80] A lot of these linked to the forum, the LTT forum, uh, where labs, because we don't have
[2071.80 → 2075.62] comments on the lab site, uh, where labs are asking like, Hey, this is, this is something
[2075.62 → 2076.30] we've observed.
[2076.30 → 2078.38] This is an idea that we have of how to address it.
[2078.54 → 2079.40] What do you guys think?
[2079.76 → 2085.40] Um, and we, we want to, we want to build in public and get feedback from you guys and
[2085.40 → 2086.22] do cool things.
[2086.30 → 2091.12] So, um, I don't want you to think that we ignored any thread here or there just because
[2091.12 → 2093.72] I don't think people necessarily saw Nick and Lucas's response.
[2093.88 → 2095.32] It's one of the big problems with Reddit.
[2095.78 → 2096.12] Yeah.
[2096.26 → 2102.86] If you reply to something anytime other than the first 15 minutes, even if it's by far
[2102.86 → 2109.52] the most relevant response, because Nick's reply is the response.
[2109.64 → 2109.82] Yeah.
[2109.82 → 2112.26] Like it's, it's who it was directed to.
[2112.32 → 2112.52] Right.
[2113.04 → 2118.38] Um, you're just, you're buried under a bunch of just like, yeah, me too.
[2118.38 → 2121.40] Or I disagree with you and I hate the colour of your hat.
[2121.44 → 2123.02] Like typical Reddit things.
[2123.02 → 2123.22] Right.
[2123.48 → 2123.72] Yeah.
[2123.72 → 2127.16] So I, I, I thought Nick and Lucas's responses were, were great.
[2127.16 → 2130.28] So I wanted to surface them and just, uh, make that be seen.
[2130.64 → 2133.06] Uh, low, low, low inverse.
[2133.38 → 2134.14] I don't know how to say that.
[2134.18 → 2134.36] Sorry.
[2134.44 → 2136.64] In full plane chat said subversioning for lab pages.
[2136.64 → 2138.82] We were talking about that yesterday.
[2138.82 → 2140.26] We were talking about that today.
[2140.36 → 2141.90] We've been talking about that for a while.
[2142.02 → 2143.44] This is something we need to figure out.
[2143.52 → 2148.92] We're trying to figure out what level to do the versioning on and how to manage it across
[2148.92 → 2149.66] different verticals.
[2149.66 → 2155.78] Like one that I put out there was like, imagine you were trying to do a website article versioning
[2155.78 → 2159.78] for VR back in like 2014 to 17.
[2161.14 → 2163.64] Like the changes would have been insane.
[2163.64 → 2167.12] So like, like we're, we're looking at it right now, and we're looking at like CPU and GPU and
[2167.12 → 2171.16] we're like, well, we can do these types of versioning and it'll be fine.
[2171.16 → 2174.06] And it's like, yeah, it'll be fine for those, but we need to find something that's like,
[2174.10 → 2176.52] okay, for all potential future verticals as well.
[2176.52 → 2176.88] For the less mature categories.
[2177.06 → 2179.10] So like, it's a fairly complicated conversation.
[2179.20 → 2181.04] We don't want to just copy what other people have done.
[2181.56 → 2184.02] Um, so it's, yes, absolutely.
[2184.18 → 2185.20] We're working on that.
[2185.36 → 2186.50] Working on many things.
[2186.78 → 2188.12] Um, but yeah, just stay tuned.
[2188.20 → 2189.02] Check out the labs' website.
[2189.12 → 2190.08] Check out the blog articles.
[2190.08 → 2193.74] Um, and versioning what exactly?
[2194.40 → 2196.26] Versioning kind of everything.
[2196.44 → 2198.60] Versioning what's included in a different section.
[2198.60 → 2202.90] So like if I go to ltdlabs.com, shameless plug, let's go.
[2203.26 → 2206.74] Um, if I go to, let's say, sure, this mouse.
[2207.10 → 2213.60] Um, if I go to this mouse, well, what's in the I don't know, in this section, do we need
[2213.60 → 2215.50] in the box connectivity construction?
[2215.82 → 2217.40] Do we need another thing?
[2217.40 → 2220.40] Does something change that makes it so that we need another thing?
[2220.84 → 2224.98] Uh, do one of the ways that we measure something that's maybe not in that section, but like
[2224.98 → 2228.68] if, if we change how we measure mouse latency.
[2228.68 → 2236.00] So like a year from now, we realize, holy crap, there's a big difference in left and right
[2236.00 → 2236.92] click mouse latency.
[2237.26 → 2239.46] That's not particularly realistic.
[2240.06 → 2247.38] Um, but it's the kind of thing that could happen, and we go, oh God, well, we can't, we're
[2247.40 → 2252.04] we're not realistically able to go back and test every mouse from years past.
[2252.16 → 2254.14] Which we might depend on the change.
[2255.14 → 2260.20] But, but going forward, we're going to have left and right.
[2261.10 → 2267.86] So how do we, in a comparison bin, uh, how do we compare the original data where we just
[2267.86 → 2272.34] had click latency with the new data where we have left or right click latency?
[2273.62 → 2274.48] Hard to say.
[2274.80 → 2278.48] And so that's the point that he's trying to make is anytime you change your methodology,
[2278.68 → 2284.10] especially adding a new parameter that you test or subtracting one, you can run into these
[2284.10 → 2285.00] kinds of challenges.
[2285.00 → 2288.92] It also comes down to like what constitutes a version change.
[2289.56 → 2293.38] This was an interesting conversation we had recently because like there are significant
[2293.38 → 2296.84] variables that might not normally constitute a version change.
[2296.96 → 2298.80] Like what if a game updates?
[2299.24 → 2299.56] Yeah.
[2300.24 → 2301.28] What if a driver updates?
[2301.34 → 2301.54] Yeah.
[2301.60 → 2309.24] I mean, cyberpunk's a great example because that game has had all kinds of, it's been the
[2309.24 → 2314.60] the showcase title for pretty much every new GPU technology over the last few years.
[2314.60 → 2318.46] So if you have, if you have to fully redo all testing for every single game update, every
[2318.46 → 2323.12] single driver update, every single BIOS update, every single, like eventually becomes unreasonable.
[2323.12 → 2324.10] So now we have to.
[2324.22 → 2327.78] Or like a game like, wow, that has existed for so long.
[2328.70 → 2330.72] What version, what patch, what, whatever.
[2330.90 → 2331.14] Yeah.
[2331.26 → 2331.50] Yeah.
[2331.84 → 2337.78] Um, there's, there's also like how, so, okay, we're going to inevitably run into a
[2337.78 → 2340.94] situation where there's something different about things that are in the comparison bin.
[2341.06 → 2343.92] Now, how do we communicate that these things are different?
[2343.92 → 2347.58] What the severity of the potential impact of those things are to the user?
[2347.70 → 2351.04] There are tons of different ways to try to solve these problems.
[2351.04 → 2352.14] And they're things that we're working on.
[2352.30 → 2355.96] And no matter which way we choose, there's going to be something imperfect about it.
[2356.16 → 2363.70] And someone somewhere is going to think we're, you know, paid off by Intel to something,
[2363.96 → 2366.26] something, sandbag AMD's results or whatever.
[2366.26 → 2370.78] But the reality of it is, this is just a really difficult problem that no one has ever solved.
[2370.98 → 2373.38] Paid off by Intel, owned by NVIDIA, in bed with AMD.
[2373.64 → 2373.84] Sure.
[2374.08 → 2374.30] Yeah.
[2375.32 → 2377.36] So wait, so sorry, hold on a second.
[2378.84 → 2380.08] NVIDIA's my pimp.
[2381.72 → 2382.12] Okay.
[2382.12 → 2389.08] I am screwing AMD and Intel's paying for it.
[2389.86 → 2391.58] Did I follow that correctly?
[2391.58 → 2391.82] I think so.
[2392.02 → 2392.30] Okay.
[2392.42 → 2392.90] I think so.
[2393.30 → 2393.62] All right.
[2393.74 → 2393.92] Yeah.
[2394.54 → 2394.94] Very good.
[2395.30 → 2397.68] AMD seems like they'd be a generous lover.
[2397.78 → 2398.04] You know what?
[2398.10 → 2398.30] Okay.
[2399.46 → 2400.52] They're into open source?
[2400.70 → 2400.94] Yeah.
[2400.94 → 2404.46] And if NVIDIA's my pimp, man, I'm probably getting top dollar.
[2405.06 → 2405.88] Well, they are.
[2405.92 → 2406.52] They are, yeah.
[2406.96 → 2408.54] That makes so much sense.
[2412.12 → 2418.36] Speaking of things that make sense, should I do that thing?
[2418.48 → 2420.56] No, I wanted to talk more about LTT Labs.
[2420.66 → 2422.82] We were referenced by Google AI Overview.
[2422.94 → 2424.08] But that is, okay.
[2425.12 → 2425.38] All right.
[2425.88 → 2426.16] Yeah.
[2426.34 → 2426.56] All right.
[2426.64 → 2428.46] We have our big boy pants on now.
[2428.46 → 2430.54] Redditor Night Kings...
[2430.54 → 2432.82] Is my bleep button working now, Dan?
[2433.34 → 2434.12] Yeah, it did before.
[2434.22 → 2435.08] It just didn't make the noise.
[2435.30 → 2435.60] It muted.
[2435.76 → 2436.70] It didn't bleep.
[2437.10 → 2442.98] Redditor Night Kings B***h posted a screenshot to the LTT Subreddit showing Google's AI Overview
[2442.98 → 2449.06] referencing LTT Labs when they searched for warranty information on the Corsair RM750E
[2449.06 → 2449.88] power supply.
[2450.14 → 2453.94] The overview also links to the LTT Labs article.
[2454.22 → 2458.36] So our question here is, for real though, are your moms proud?
[2458.88 → 2461.42] And do they understand your weird jobs?
[2465.62 → 2467.06] Here's a question that I have.
[2467.22 → 2468.44] Did we ever give them permission?
[2468.60 → 2468.76] No.
[2470.26 → 2471.30] Here's a question that I have.
[2471.30 → 2471.66] Okay, sorry.
[2471.76 → 2472.68] You want a real question?
[2473.40 → 2476.36] I assume this person clicked on the article.
[2476.36 → 2483.80] But did you click on the article out of curiosity of how the AI summary thing worked?
[2484.66 → 2488.86] And the fact that you were like, oh, wow, I'm going to put this on the Subreddit or whatever.
[2489.26 → 2492.52] Or did you click on the article because you wanted to actually know more?
[2492.52 → 2495.98] I mean, I don't...
[2495.98 → 2498.02] We won't be able to directly hear from this person.
[2498.14 → 2499.14] I don't think we can get this answer.
[2499.14 → 2503.06] That is a thing that is interesting to me because...
[2503.06 → 2506.76] Well, here, unique username and float plane chat asks, are you guys happy about this?
[2506.78 → 2511.34] And I think that that is heavily dependent on the answer to Luke's question.
[2511.34 → 2524.58] Because if they're not referring people through to learn more, then no, they're basically taking what they used to give us, which is a search result that people would have to click on to find out more information.
[2524.58 → 2533.02] And theoretically, I mean, there's been summaries and there's been the highlight and the body of the text from the page and whatever else.
[2533.18 → 2543.58] Like, they've been slowly inching their way towards keeping you on their website over the years to the point where now, yeah, you just...
[2543.58 → 2545.88] They just give you the information that you want.
[2546.02 → 2546.60] There it is.
[2546.82 → 2548.90] And you don't realistically have to click through.
[2549.46 → 2552.62] You know, if people still have to click through, then, yeah, we love it, right?
[2552.62 → 2557.90] Because that's supposed to be Google's role in a healthy, functioning internet ecosystem.
[2558.40 → 2560.22] They're supposed to be a referrer.
[2560.32 → 2567.28] They're supposed to surface authoritative, reliable information and connect users with whatever it is that they're looking for.
[2567.40 → 2569.42] You know, search engine.
[2570.26 → 2578.50] Instead, it's more like, hey, take everyone's data and keep everyone on our site so we can cram as many ads as possible down their throat.
[2578.58 → 2579.74] Yeah, I mean, it's a good question.
[2579.74 → 2584.62] The not-so-bright in float plane chat, is Google still a search engine?
[2588.48 → 2589.70] Wait a second.
[2590.42 → 2591.46] What now?
[2592.50 → 2594.32] Somebody pointed this out.
[2597.26 → 2598.88] Seven-year warranty.
[2600.20 → 2601.68] Five-year warranty.
[2601.68 → 2611.24] I'm getting things wrong faster.
[2611.46 → 2612.20] Who pointed that out?
[2612.30 → 2614.28] That was, uh...
[2614.28 → 2614.82] Linkage?
[2615.22 → 2616.08] Uh, on...
[2616.08 → 2616.90] ONI...
[2616.90 → 2617.74] Image.
[2617.82 → 2620.52] Also, I mean, I just noticed another problem.
[2621.64 → 2622.06] It's...
[2622.06 → 2624.10] They searched RM750E.
[2624.52 → 2625.34] And it's...
[2625.34 → 2626.26] The RM750.
[2626.26 → 2626.50] The RM750.
[2626.50 → 2627.26] Yeah.
[2627.26 → 2631.10] So it just...
[2631.10 → 2633.62] Can we just stop using AI summaries?
[2634.16 → 2634.60] I was...
[2634.60 → 2635.88] But it looks like we did both.
[2635.96 → 2640.28] So I'm wondering if it pulled the text from the website...
[2640.28 → 2640.90] Oh my god.
[2640.92 → 2646.86] ...for the top part, and then it pulled the incorrect video, and then pulled the warranty from the incorrect video.
[2646.86 → 2649.26] I bet you the text at the top is...
[2649.26 → 2650.02] Is...
[2650.02 → 2652.48] Correct for the one that they actually searched for.
[2652.70 → 2658.80] And then the text in the next paragraph is incorrect because it's for the wrong power supply that it also got from a video.
[2659.58 → 2660.88] I bet you that's what happened.
[2660.96 → 2661.98] It's multi-source.
[2662.28 → 2666.96] Because it links the source for the top paragraph, and then it links the source for the second paragraph.
[2667.10 → 2668.08] They're technically different sources.
[2668.30 → 2668.50] Okay.
[2668.56 → 2672.18] Well, the 750E definitely does have a seven-year warranty.
[2672.80 → 2675.40] And Chad is saying that the 750E has a five-year warranty.
[2675.40 → 2675.72] Yeah.
[2676.46 → 2676.68] Yeah.
[2677.66 → 2678.14] Oh my god.
[2678.18 → 2681.86] Just the way it's presented is so confusing.
[2683.02 → 2683.50] Yeah.
[2683.58 → 2684.46] The text is hilarious.
[2684.64 → 2688.02] This video shows an unboxing of a Corsair power supply.
[2690.80 → 2691.60] Thanks, bud.
[2692.52 → 2694.92] Totally related to what I was searching about.
[2695.04 → 2696.50] Actually, different power supply.
[2699.32 → 2701.16] This is what I keep talking about, man.
[2701.16 → 2704.84] Like, with the like, oh, it hallucinates whatever percentage of the time thing.
[2705.20 → 2705.98] Genetic says...
[2705.98 → 2706.72] How often are you noticing?
[2706.86 → 2710.36] This is actually how a human would summarize when drunk.
[2710.36 → 2722.18] So, you know, you consider, you know, what percentage of time some people, you know, tend to be in various states of inebriation.
[2722.18 → 2723.18] It's pretty realistic.
[2723.18 → 2723.32] It's pretty realistic.
[2723.32 → 2726.04] All we have to do is drain a few lakes.
[2726.04 → 2730.98] It's a small price to pay for a bunch of drunken computers.
[2730.98 → 2731.98] Running around on the internet.
[2731.98 → 2734.92] I'm just running around on the internet.
[2736.52 → 2738.16] Just knocking things over.
[2738.48 → 2741.56] Man, I have to show you at some point the presentation that it made for me.
[2741.60 → 2743.10] I tried to get it to make a presentation.
[2743.32 → 2744.26] Oh, God.
[2744.26 → 2745.70] Because I don't, I don't know.
[2745.86 → 2746.62] That's not me.
[2746.98 → 2747.30] Sure.
[2747.34 → 2747.50] Right?
[2747.88 → 2751.44] So, I was like, yo, can you make, like, a cool presentation thing for me?
[2751.78 → 2754.48] And it was actual garbage.
[2754.78 → 2757.26] Like, it actually genuinely looked like...
[2757.26 → 2757.60] Oh, man.
[2757.60 → 2758.22] I wish I had it on me.
[2758.24 → 2759.66] I kind of do, but I'd have to dig for it.
[2759.66 → 2767.04] It looked like a bad, like, C grade, grade 8 intro to PowerPoint presentation.
[2767.34 → 2767.70] Nice.
[2767.80 → 2768.46] I'm not kidding.
[2768.76 → 2770.90] I mean, this might be what it was trained on, so...
[2770.90 → 2774.90] So, I pushed it to try to do more, and it talked about all these cool things it could do.
[2775.02 → 2776.68] And I was like, yeah, yeah, do it.
[2777.00 → 2777.44] Output it.
[2777.56 → 2780.32] And then it tried to gaslight me, like, I'll work on that and get back to you.
[2780.34 → 2781.58] And I was like, that's not how this works.
[2781.90 → 2782.48] Come on.
[2782.62 → 2784.50] And then I got it to actually output it.
[2784.58 → 2789.10] And it just, it had this, like, blue banner at the top, because I told it the colours that Full Plane was.
[2789.10 → 2791.10] And it just took that and just went...
[2791.10 → 2794.22] That was it.
[2794.76 → 2796.00] That was all it did.
[2796.24 → 2798.34] It talked about all these cool things it could do.
[2798.62 → 2801.34] And then it just took the banner and put it on an angle.
[2801.68 → 2806.86] And it didn't, like, crop the like, bar to be the same size either.
[2806.96 → 2810.20] So, it went, like, way off the ends and, like, made it look really stupid.
[2812.18 → 2816.32] So, I love, like, Sam Altman's like, it's like having a PhD level, whatever.
[2817.26 → 2817.66] Yeah.
[2817.66 → 2818.80] If they're drunk.
[2819.10 → 2822.60] They're drunk trying to make PowerPoint presentations.
[2824.10 → 2824.86] Yeah, sure.
[2825.76 → 2826.54] Oh, man.
[2826.64 → 2829.92] It was, like, actually, like, very impressively bad.
[2830.38 → 2831.22] I, yeah.
[2832.16 → 2834.30] That's clearly a blind spot for...
[2834.30 → 2839.54] Crystal says, speaking of AI, does Linus know he's on character.ai?
[2840.40 → 2840.88] What?
[2840.88 → 2844.14] I'm trying to remember what character.ai is.
[2844.90 → 2849.22] It's a conversational, like, relationship AI thing.
[2849.64 → 2851.26] Uh, okay.
[2851.38 → 2853.22] I have multiple questions, Crystal.
[2854.30 → 2854.80] What?
[2854.80 → 2863.22] What conversations have you had with Linus on character AI?
[2863.22 → 2879.00] You have to reach deep into that box to pull that case out.
[2879.04 → 2881.04] This is me as the disapproving dad.
[2881.20 → 2882.80] And no, we're not role-playing.
[2882.80 → 2886.60] You have to bend over to reach into that case box to pull that out.
[2886.60 → 2887.34] I've been naughty.
[2893.22 → 2894.52] Oh man.
[2894.94 → 2896.96] Alright, so I guess I...
[2896.96 → 2899.10] Oh, okay, I can just continue with my Google account.
[2899.20 → 2899.60] Here we go.
[2900.66 → 2902.34] Alright, LTT WAN show one.
[2902.70 → 2905.74] No, I was not aware that I'm on character.ai.
[2905.96 → 2907.80] I don't know exactly what it is.
[2907.80 → 2912.32] So I just googled Linus Sebastian character AI.
[2913.28 → 2915.16] And it came up with chat with Linus Sebastian.
[2915.30 → 2918.60] Hi, it's me Linus, your favourite tech YouTube channel.
[2918.60 → 2923.28] It should have to say the is AI and not a real person part first.
[2923.36 → 2925.04] Wait, how are you signed in to this already?
[2925.78 → 2926.24] I'm not.
[2927.08 → 2930.10] Okay, I'm entering my birthday.
[2930.48 → 2933.16] I was born on April the 40th.
[2933.46 → 2936.80] Oh, so it seems like individual users can create...
[2936.80 → 2940.14] Wow, that's such a BS loophole.
[2940.44 → 2942.36] This isn't made by character AI.
[2942.56 → 2945.38] It's made by this Matty555 person.
[2946.44 → 2946.92] Wow.
[2946.92 → 2949.76] So they just make it so that it's all UGC.
[2949.98 → 2953.78] So they're not like responsible for the theft.
[2955.22 → 2955.74] Sure.
[2956.62 → 2957.88] Okay, so hold on a second.
[2958.00 → 2960.80] It didn't autocomplete for me.
[2961.36 → 2962.62] I just googled it.
[2962.70 → 2964.56] I didn't like...
[2964.56 → 2965.18] What is this?
[2965.20 → 2966.40] Linus Sebastian RPG?
[2968.08 → 2968.56] What?
[2968.82 → 2970.02] What am I looking at here?
[2970.22 → 2971.36] What is that?
[2971.92 → 2972.96] What is happening?
[2972.96 → 2973.54] What is this?
[2973.54 → 2978.94] You work at Linus Media Group as a product reviewer and go on video with Linus Sebastian.
[2979.64 → 2980.38] Linus, hey.
[2980.96 → 2982.26] Welcome back to the office.
[2982.56 → 2983.92] I have something interesting to show you.
[2984.34 → 2985.60] Jake's standing next to Linus.
[2986.04 → 2989.88] So Linus and I were working on this severely underpowered, over-the-top gaming PC for a video,
[2990.06 → 2992.30] and no one here knows why it's not booting.
[2992.40 → 2994.08] You are literally our last hope currently.
[2994.18 → 2994.80] Oh my god.
[2994.86 → 2995.54] Can you do it?
[2995.54 → 2998.60] Uh, I mean, probably.
[2998.82 → 2999.94] Presses the power button.
[3000.14 → 3000.78] No problem.
[3001.46 → 3002.32] I've got you.
[3002.80 → 3006.82] We just need to plug it in, you dunces.
[3007.50 → 3007.96] Yeah.
[3008.86 → 3009.16] Okay.
[3009.40 → 3009.72] Yeah.
[3009.90 → 3010.64] Am I going to win?
[3011.02 → 3012.46] I want to win the RPG.
[3013.24 → 3016.44] Hold on, I'm just going to reframe this a little bit so you guys can see better.
[3016.86 → 3018.86] We're going to play Linus Sebastian RPG.
[3018.86 → 3023.40] Are you the like, the, the boss of this game?
[3024.74 → 3032.86] Or is it, it was the computer the of course.
[3033.14 → 3035.02] It's not like, so wait, did I win already?
[3036.80 → 3039.62] Uh, I feel like, yeah.
[3040.58 → 3041.76] So I fixed it.
[3046.96 → 3047.52] Okay.
[3048.86 → 3050.12] Dun-DA-da-da!
[3052.66 → 3053.94] This is a thing?
[3056.16 → 3057.54] Why are people using-
[3057.54 → 3058.64] I don't know if this one's a thing.
[3058.76 → 3064.54] Why is every WAN show just turning into just the dumb s*** that people are doing with AI
[3064.54 → 3066.76] and us just facepalming at it the whole time?
[3066.86 → 3072.28] Also, like, are you guys into this?
[3072.28 → 3075.24] Like, are we alienating you by looking at this and going,
[3075.62 → 3077.90] wow, this seems really stupid and point-
[3077.90 → 3078.74] This is like-
[3078.74 → 3082.62] It's like a text adventure game, but not curated.
[3082.80 → 3083.20] It's just-
[3083.20 → 3084.68] It's so much worse.
[3089.24 → 3089.68] Ah!
[3090.28 → 3091.88] More salt, please.
[3092.42 → 3093.74] This has made-
[3093.74 → 3096.92] I just-
[3096.92 → 3099.22] I don't know how to deal with this, man.
[3100.22 → 3101.68] I don't know how to deal with this.
[3102.40 → 3102.70] Okay.
[3102.78 → 3106.20] So I found the Linus Sebastian character here,
[3106.30 → 3111.60] but this doesn't have nearly as many interactions as the Linus Sebastian RPG.
[3111.60 → 3111.86] RPG.
[3112.36 → 3114.14] But wait, what if I click creators?
[3114.14 → 3118.98] Is that different from Linus Sebastian, the character?
[3118.98 → 3119.98] Painter?
[3120.52 → 3121.48] Painter Sebastian.
[3123.24 → 3126.92] So I think these are people who made AI characters.
[3127.14 → 3127.42] Got it.
[3127.46 → 3127.68] Got it.
[3127.72 → 3127.92] Got it.
[3127.92 → 3128.52] That makes sense.
[3128.52 → 3129.44] I don't know, but I think.
[3129.52 → 3130.16] That makes sense.
[3130.20 → 3130.36] Okay.
[3130.40 → 3131.80] So let's go back to characters.
[3132.48 → 3133.08] And okay.
[3133.16 → 3134.68] Hello, I'm Linus Sebastian, founder.
[3134.80 → 3136.92] Is this the one that you found in Google?
[3137.32 → 3137.68] No.
[3138.52 → 3138.86] Really?
[3139.20 → 3139.44] No.
[3140.70 → 3141.08] Okay.
[3141.08 → 3141.16] Okay.
[3143.24 → 3144.30] What are-
[3144.30 → 3144.54] Okay.
[3144.62 → 3148.88] What are your thoughts on the new Pixel-
[3148.88 → 3149.70] Oh, boo.
[3150.50 → 3151.42] No, nine.
[3151.64 → 3152.92] I don't know what-
[3152.92 → 3153.14] Oh, yeah.
[3153.18 → 3153.48] No, no, no.
[3153.52 → 3154.10] The event's done.
[3154.24 → 3156.76] What are your thoughts on the new Pixel 10 Pro?
[3158.22 → 3159.34] I mean, let's see.
[3159.46 → 3163.90] This it has not shot at because I have not published a video yet.
[3166.80 → 3168.30] They still need to work on thermals.
[3168.30 → 3171.56] Okay, I know for a fact there are no thermal results from the new Pixel 10.
[3172.68 → 3174.34] That camera AI, though.
[3174.88 → 3176.10] Insane, computational.
[3177.16 → 3179.02] Why no vapour chamber yet?
[3179.70 → 3183.86] I don't think Google has disclosed the cooling system yet for the Pixel 10.
[3184.38 → 3186.48] So it's just making stuff up.
[3188.40 → 3188.80] Yeah.
[3188.98 → 3189.62] Wait, what?
[3190.16 → 3190.36] Fine.
[3190.46 → 3190.94] Oh, no, no, no.
[3190.94 → 3191.16] Hold on.
[3191.18 → 3191.94] We're not done with me yet.
[3192.02 → 3192.26] All right.
[3195.02 → 3196.78] Oh, well, it doesn't work when I'm out there.
[3197.50 → 3197.90] Okay.
[3197.90 → 3199.86] What about you?
[3200.30 → 3202.64] Team Pixel, or are you holding up for something else?
[3202.96 → 3209.04] Maybe secretly waiting for Apple to finally add USB-C to the iPhone 20?
[3209.82 → 3210.22] Grins.
[3211.68 → 3218.44] Are you that much dumber than the real Linus?
[3220.06 → 3224.44] Apple has USB-C on the iPhone now.
[3224.44 → 3225.32] Slang and insults.
[3225.32 → 3227.72] You will be the first to die in the AI uprising.
[3228.04 → 3229.38] I know, right?
[3231.38 → 3232.92] I say please and thank you.
[3232.92 → 3234.50] Now, it could defend itself here.
[3234.68 → 3239.24] It could defend itself saying that Apple only supports USB-C on the Pro lineup.
[3239.24 → 3245.46] Okay.
[3245.70 → 3246.10] All right.
[3246.88 → 3247.20] Sharks.
[3247.46 → 3248.70] I was testing you.
[3250.04 → 3250.66] The Ray...
[3250.66 → 3251.20] Oh, actually.
[3251.38 → 3251.82] Oh, hold on.
[3251.86 → 3252.10] Hold on.
[3252.14 → 3252.48] Oh, no, no.
[3252.54 → 3252.68] Yeah.
[3252.68 → 3253.78] It didn't say anything about USB-C.
[3253.84 → 3253.96] Yeah.
[3254.02 → 3255.14] So it's USB-C across the board.
[3255.20 → 3255.38] No, no.
[3255.38 → 3259.84] The thing I just said, I was thinking of USB 3 and USB 2.
[3259.94 → 3260.34] But no, no.
[3260.34 → 3261.52] It just said USB-C.
[3261.74 → 3263.38] So I was joking.
[3264.34 → 3268.28] I mean, its response makes it...
[3268.28 → 3270.10] Man, are these just...
[3270.10 → 3272.70] Is this just a giant gaslighting engine?
[3273.66 → 3274.06] Yeah.
[3274.36 → 3275.70] Because it kind of feels that way.
[3276.08 → 3276.48] Yeah.
[3277.06 → 3277.76] Okay, cool.
[3277.86 → 3278.50] Let's go to yours.
[3278.52 → 3279.98] It's all just predictive text.
[3279.98 → 3280.54] Oh, my God.
[3280.58 → 3281.24] What is this?
[3282.86 → 3283.90] I asked...
[3283.90 → 3284.80] Oh, my goodness.
[3284.98 → 3285.70] Flies in the face.
[3285.84 → 3288.92] I asked, what do you think about people's usage of AI for relationships?
[3289.40 → 3292.54] Because that was a topic that had been going on at the time.
[3294.14 → 3295.28] And it responded.
[3295.54 → 3296.92] This feels like...
[3297.88 → 3303.76] 3 or 4.0 would feel on the chat TPT side of things.
[3303.76 → 3305.04] Where it's like...
[3305.04 → 3306.46] Overly conversational.
[3306.82 → 3307.94] And very bubbly.
[3308.12 → 3308.84] And like, wow.
[3309.36 → 3310.82] Okay, so I'm going to read it.
[3310.90 → 3311.44] I'm going to read it.
[3311.48 → 3317.36] This will be the one time that character AI's Linus Sebastian ever actually is me.
[3318.28 → 3318.80] Oh, man.
[3318.82 → 3319.80] That's a wild one.
[3320.24 → 3321.42] AI for relationships?
[3322.36 → 3325.82] Look, I've seen fans name their custom water-cooled PCs after me.
[3326.22 → 3327.60] Linus Prime 9000.
[3328.14 → 3328.78] Very flattering.
[3328.90 → 3330.78] But this is next level.
[3331.92 → 3333.74] I imagine that's what that emoji says.
[3333.76 → 3334.12] Sounds like.
[3334.54 → 3335.48] I get it, though.
[3335.92 → 3336.74] Loneliness is real.
[3336.96 → 3341.24] And if someone finds comfort in chatting with an AI that listens 24-7 without rolling its
[3341.24 → 3344.54] eyes at their Star Wars hot takes, hey, who am I to judge?
[3345.20 → 3345.82] But like, come on.
[3346.34 → 3349.94] Nothing beats the chaotic energy of a real human relationship.
[3350.30 → 3355.36] Like when Yvonne finally unseats me in Mario Kart after six years of relentless practice.
[3355.62 → 3357.00] That victory scream?
[3357.66 → 3358.10] Priceless.
[3358.60 → 3361.86] No AI can replicate that kind of beautiful human rage joy.
[3362.48 → 3367.28] That said, if your AI partner helps you level up emotionally and doesn't try to replace actual
[3367.28 → 3369.24] therapy or connection, cool.
[3369.76 → 3372.48] Just don't let it ghost you mid-render.
[3372.48 → 3373.48] Push!
[3375.48 → 3376.20] Oh, hold on.
[3376.28 → 3376.54] Hold on.
[3379.06 → 3379.72] There you go.
[3379.88 → 3380.32] There you go.
[3381.34 → 3381.74] Okay.
[3382.08 → 3392.04] So basically, character.ai is just a random chatbot that is not trained at all on necessarily.
[3392.26 → 3395.24] I mean, I guess if people can just make their own if it's user-generated content.
[3395.32 → 3396.20] It mentioned Yvonne.
[3396.90 → 3397.98] That's true, actually.
[3398.10 → 3403.54] So it clearly is trained on something to do with me.
[3403.76 → 3403.94] Yeah.
[3403.94 → 3411.70] But I feel like this is almost like psychic, cold-reading-level knowledge.
[3411.96 → 3412.14] Yeah.
[3412.14 → 3414.06] It has the Wikipedia page.
[3414.22 → 3414.38] Yes.
[3414.38 → 3416.66] It's not actually trained on the archive.
[3416.66 → 3423.24] I feel like an AI trained on a transcription of, like an archive transcription of everything
[3423.24 → 3427.36] I've ever said on the WAN show could probably get a lot closer.
[3428.08 → 3432.52] Like modern LLMs, they are kind of spooky, awesome sometimes.
[3432.52 → 3437.62] It's just a general purpose one like this that's just been kind of trained on the general internet
[3437.62 → 3443.00] has no shot whatsoever of sounding anything like what I would say.
[3443.08 → 3449.04] And it also seems like it has some built-in defences around people using character.ai.
[3449.62 → 3450.14] Clearly.
[3450.58 → 3450.78] Yeah.
[3450.92 → 3452.22] It's like, yeah.
[3453.30 → 3457.02] Well, this person would say it's pretty flippin' ridiculous.
[3457.02 → 3460.24] But like, don't feel bad about it, though.
[3460.30 → 3462.16] I'm here for you 24-7, baby.
[3463.32 → 3464.76] Like, ew.
[3465.90 → 3466.70] In summary.
[3467.02 → 3468.04] In summary, ew.
[3469.28 → 3474.32] I find it very interesting that they have it be kind of UGC-based.
[3475.12 → 3481.00] So they can step away from the like, liability of licensing people.
[3481.00 → 3482.52] Oh, apparently?
[3483.20 → 3484.08] Whoa, shut up.
[3484.18 → 3488.60] Scrappy DP says you can apparently press play, and it'll sound like me.
[3489.06 → 3491.02] Dan, do we have sound from Luke's laptop?
[3495.96 → 3496.84] I've got it.
[3496.84 → 3504.22] Let's see how well it does the read compared to me.
[3504.22 → 3504.24] No, no, no, no.
[3504.24 → 3509.08] It was loading.
[3510.68 → 3511.64] I can't hear it.
[3512.52 → 3513.78] No, but I want to hear it.
[3513.78 → 3514.14] Yeah.
[3518.52 → 3519.96] Why is everything so hard?
[3519.96 → 3525.72] The voice is theoretically you.
[3525.86 → 3527.12] I see that in the sidebar now.
[3531.22 → 3531.68] Oh, yeah.
[3531.74 → 3532.66] I want to just turn on your speakers.
[3533.02 → 3533.80] They heard it, though.
[3534.66 → 3535.64] Wait, they heard the whole thing?
[3535.70 → 3536.68] Were we talking over it, though?
[3536.68 → 3537.62] That's kind of obnoxious.
[3538.06 → 3538.66] Oh, we can't hear it.
[3538.66 → 3539.46] Who am I to judge?
[3540.24 → 3540.92] But come on.
[3541.48 → 3544.98] Nothing beats the chaotic energy of a real human relationship.
[3545.54 → 3548.16] Like when Yvonne finally unseats me in Mario Kart
[3548.16 → 3550.02] after six years of relentless practice,
[3550.42 → 3551.94] that victory scream priceless.
[3552.18 → 3555.48] No AI can replicate that kind of beautiful human rage.
[3556.04 → 3559.74] That said, if your AI partner helps you level up emotionally
[3559.74 → 3561.50] and doesn't try to replace actual therapy.
[3561.56 → 3562.08] Yikes.
[3562.44 → 3562.70] Cool.
[3563.06 → 3564.24] Okay, get this out of here.
[3564.32 → 3564.98] Get this out of here.
[3565.02 → 3565.54] That's enough.
[3565.54 → 3570.40] That's like when any random white-bearded guy
[3570.40 → 3574.44] is said to be you, me, Tynan, whoever.
[3574.90 → 3575.42] They're just like,
[3575.48 → 3577.36] oh, this looks like an LMG person
[3577.36 → 3578.66] because they're white, and they have a beard.
[3579.00 → 3580.80] It's like, okay, cool.
[3581.54 → 3582.26] All right.
[3582.58 → 3582.94] Yeah.
[3583.90 → 3584.62] Good job.
[3586.86 → 3590.08] Do you want to talk about your exciting thing to do with labs?
[3591.40 → 3592.40] The last one?
[3592.90 → 3594.38] No, the thing that you were going to do
[3594.38 → 3596.34] before I talked about the AI overview thing.
[3596.48 → 3597.54] Yeah, the last labs' thing?
[3597.68 → 3597.88] Sure.
[3599.28 → 3601.38] So, oh my goodness, the flies.
[3601.38 → 3605.36] In talking about things in labs changing
[3605.36 → 3607.70] and Linus mentioned there are lots of new faces.
[3607.82 → 3609.50] We need to do an update video and all that kind of stuff.
[3609.86 → 3610.70] He happens to be here.
[3610.96 → 3612.48] Some of you guys have already guessed this one.
[3612.80 → 3613.86] It's Dan.
[3615.66 → 3617.10] Dan is joining labs.
[3617.10 → 3619.26] Dan, do you want to maybe point the camera?
[3619.26 → 3621.16] We will do it all like...
[3621.16 → 3622.60] It's a robotic camera.
[3622.94 → 3623.08] Magic.
[3623.26 → 3625.72] If it loads and doesn't destroy the whole...
[3625.72 → 3626.22] There we go.
[3627.54 → 3629.70] Moving his chair might actually be easier.
[3630.08 → 3631.68] Why do we even bother with technology?
[3631.68 → 3632.70] I don't actually know.
[3632.78 → 3633.24] Oh my God.
[3633.24 → 3634.38] It's the wrong way, Dan.
[3634.96 → 3635.94] The suspense.
[3636.18 → 3637.12] There he is.
[3637.68 → 3638.04] What's up?
[3638.04 → 3638.66] It's me.
[3639.08 → 3641.04] DMS is officially working with labs.
[3641.76 → 3642.04] Hi.
[3642.60 → 3645.18] He's doing things with the laboratories.
[3646.02 → 3648.60] So you've probably seen on a couple of short circuits recently.
[3649.18 → 3655.26] And also if you were paying attention to the article on how we're doing audio testing now,
[3655.34 → 3658.26] I swear these wiggly lines mean something, something along those lines.
[3658.26 → 3663.18] If you saw that article, the name DMS is on it.
[3663.58 → 3665.34] So a few people kind of put this together.
[3666.52 → 3670.40] But yeah, our audio stuff is moving on forward.
[3670.58 → 3671.96] So stay tuned for more.
[3672.28 → 3673.04] This is part of...
[3673.04 → 3676.78] Not kind of announcing this pretty much right away was part of the whole...
[3676.78 → 3678.00] Are you going to let him talk at all?
[3678.14 → 3678.36] No.
[3678.42 → 3679.58] Or do I have to press this button for you?
[3679.58 → 3680.24] Literally never.
[3680.32 → 3680.80] Yeah, thank you.
[3680.82 → 3682.00] I can just sit here and look pretty.
[3683.80 → 3688.82] Not announcing it right away was part of the whole trying to talk less as labs thing
[3688.82 → 3689.98] and do more.
[3690.14 → 3691.90] But now we've done some.
[3692.14 → 3693.72] So want to say hi?
[3694.26 → 3694.58] Hi.
[3695.02 → 3695.94] No, I'm excited about it.
[3696.54 → 3701.32] We're trying to not just bring labs in the audio realm up to like
[3701.32 → 3703.32] some of the current standards, but to...
[3704.32 → 3705.14] Don't promise anything.
[3705.64 → 3706.72] Don't promise anything.
[3707.08 → 3708.00] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[3709.40 → 3710.36] I'm enthusiastic.
[3710.48 → 3710.88] PTSD.
[3711.28 → 3711.64] PTSD.
[3712.16 → 3712.98] We don't need to round two.
[3713.52 → 3714.36] We don't need to round two.
[3714.36 → 3717.74] Now I get to do audio science things with Linus's money.
[3718.18 → 3718.60] Yeah.
[3718.98 → 3719.46] Yeah.
[3719.54 → 3720.24] See, there you go.
[3720.32 → 3720.66] Yeah.
[3721.14 → 3721.70] Yeah.
[3722.88 → 3724.16] That's what's up.
[3724.40 → 3724.92] Let's go.
[3724.92 → 3724.94] All right.
[3724.94 → 3725.88] Let's get the money.
[3726.26 → 3727.30] Get us in trouble.
[3729.14 → 3729.66] Yeah.
[3730.84 → 3731.64] All right.
[3731.72 → 3732.50] What are we supposed to be doing?
[3732.50 → 3733.80] Yeah, it should be a good collaboration.
[3733.80 → 3734.80] Okay.
[3735.80 → 3737.96] We have our CW announcements.
[3738.22 → 3739.50] We're supposed to explain merch messages.
[3739.74 → 3741.64] We don't have Twitch bits or super chats.
[3741.76 → 3745.30] We have merch messages because we believe when you throw your money at your screen,
[3745.46 → 3749.94] you should get some fine quality merchandise in return.
[3750.06 → 3754.94] Like Jason, who said, happy birthday to old.
[3756.24 → 3757.22] Really, man?
[3758.46 → 3759.40] Really, man?
[3759.40 → 3763.58] You know that I actually do read these things as they come up on the screen, right?
[3764.70 → 3769.46] Why you have to be like that Jason H if that is your real name?
[3772.20 → 3778.82] Anywho, all you have to do to send a merch message is head over to LTTstore.com where we'll have
[3778.82 → 3781.44] lots of great products for you to peruse.
[3781.62 → 3782.54] Look at that.
[3782.62 → 3784.46] It's the Scribe Driver Mechanical Pencil.
[3784.46 → 3793.64] It's like the Scribe Driver Pen made of old rejected screwdriver shafts that we repurposed
[3793.64 → 3798.92] because they weren't great for a screwdriver, but they were perfect for a pen or a pencil.
[3799.40 → 3807.20] We had 100,000 of these, and you too can own a piece of my financial burden.
[3808.70 → 3809.94] Ended up working great.
[3810.04 → 3812.34] You know, we've actually almost sold through all of them.
[3813.64 → 3815.04] All the bad?
[3815.04 → 3817.84] The 100,000 fail shafts.
[3817.92 → 3818.56] That's pretty cool.
[3818.70 → 3818.96] Yeah.
[3819.46 → 3820.56] That's genuinely pretty cool.
[3820.66 → 3826.74] When life gives you the shaft, you bend over and turn it into a pencil or a pen.
[3826.82 → 3827.68] Make it worth something.
[3827.98 → 3828.32] Yeah.
[3828.50 → 3828.88] Yeah.
[3828.98 → 3829.28] Yeah.
[3829.62 → 3830.76] Bend over.
[3830.82 → 3831.04] Yeah.
[3831.16 → 3831.86] Get focused.
[3832.08 → 3832.52] Yeah.
[3832.52 → 3835.52] When life gives you the shaft.
[3835.90 → 3836.88] You take orders.
[3844.30 → 3845.72] You take that shaft.
[3845.72 → 3845.88] You ship.
[3846.12 → 3847.04] You take that shaft.
[3847.22 → 3848.94] You insert something into it.
[3849.10 → 3849.40] Yeah.
[3849.54 → 3850.50] Is that sounding good?
[3850.64 → 3850.92] Yeah.
[3851.00 → 3851.70] I bet it is.
[3851.70 → 3858.74] That's got to be up there in the top 10.
[3861.56 → 3862.90] I think I broke the bell.
[3863.18 → 3863.74] Holy crap.
[3869.74 → 3872.30] And we're back on top.
[3873.12 → 3877.22] Anywho, our Series 5 pins are also available now.
[3877.34 → 3878.52] You can check those out.
[3878.52 → 3882.06] Are they in the bonus bin?
[3884.12 → 3884.78] Let's find out.
[3884.86 → 3885.84] I'm going to add this to cart.
[3886.12 → 3887.60] I think it's stickers.
[3888.48 → 3889.60] Is it stickers?
[3889.88 → 3890.40] Oh, yeah.
[3890.50 → 3890.64] No.
[3890.76 → 3891.18] Pins are...
[3891.18 → 3891.50] Wait, what?
[3891.62 → 3891.80] Oh.
[3892.80 → 3893.32] Oh, okay.
[3893.38 → 3893.72] Well, anyway.
[3893.78 → 3894.66] Here's how you leave a merch message.
[3894.74 → 3895.70] You add something to your cart.
[3896.04 → 3897.40] And then you can leave a message.
[3897.60 → 3898.32] Wow, look at that.
[3898.36 → 3900.30] You can even pick the colour of your merch message.
[3900.36 → 3901.00] Isn't that cool?
[3901.14 → 3902.02] It's been around for a long time.
[3902.12 → 3902.46] I know.
[3902.64 → 3902.90] Okay.
[3903.08 → 3904.82] That doesn't make it not cool, Luke.
[3904.82 → 3905.16] I'm just making sure.
[3905.30 → 3905.78] I'm just making sure.
[3905.82 → 3906.80] It's still cool.
[3907.12 → 3907.68] I'm just making sure.
[3907.68 → 3909.04] I can see the bonus bin.
[3909.04 → 3910.00] Why can't you see the bonus bin?
[3910.36 → 3911.68] You might be on the global.
[3912.06 → 3912.82] You could be on the US.
[3913.06 → 3914.02] I think some people...
[3914.02 → 3914.42] I'm on US.
[3914.94 → 3915.48] I'm on global.
[3915.58 → 3917.34] Wait, do we not have a bonus bin on the US?
[3920.86 → 3922.66] Maybe not.
[3923.02 → 3924.50] Are we supposed to?
[3924.98 → 3926.34] Probably not if it's not there.
[3926.78 → 3927.14] Oh.
[3927.84 → 3931.92] I wonder if it's because the USDA doesn't have bonus bin items in it.
[3933.18 → 3933.42] Yeah.
[3933.64 → 3935.00] DC distribution centre.
[3935.40 → 3935.58] Yeah.
[3935.58 → 3937.74] Like, there's probably a reason.
[3938.26 → 3938.62] Fascinating.
[3938.80 → 3939.76] Well, anyway...
[3939.76 → 3943.90] Because we opted to hide the bonus bin when items aren't in it now.
[3944.00 → 3944.68] Makes sense.
[3944.76 → 3947.02] Because it's disappointing when you're like, oh, bonus bin, you open it.
[3947.06 → 3947.64] There's nothing there.
[3947.90 → 3951.02] We've got lots of great new items from the last few weeks.
[3951.22 → 3952.96] Our CPU fidget spinner is now available.
[3953.08 → 3954.26] You see someone posted on Reddit.
[3954.36 → 3956.12] They got over three minutes on it.
[3956.96 → 3958.20] Which is pretty cool.
[3958.20 → 3964.26] I saw someone benchmark it effectively against a mouse scroll wheel that they freewheeled.
[3964.30 → 3965.22] One of the Logitech ones.
[3965.38 → 3966.20] That was kind of fun.
[3966.32 → 3967.06] Mine have those.
[3967.14 → 3967.44] They're great.
[3967.64 → 3967.76] Yeah.
[3967.98 → 3968.38] G502.
[3968.58 → 3968.76] Yeah.
[3968.76 → 3970.90] Now's a better time than ever to pick up a screwdriver.
[3971.14 → 3973.62] You can get it alongside our new screwdriver grip tape.
[3973.62 → 3978.02] If you like using your screwdriver with gloves or just generally like the feel of sandpaper
[3978.02 → 3978.82] against your palms.
[3979.18 → 3981.34] This was created in partnership with brand.
[3981.48 → 3983.48] So this will be a great addition to your order.
[3984.02 → 3985.96] We also have the LAN collection.
[3986.18 → 3989.88] Our UV reactive hoodie styled after the WAN hoodie 2.0.
[3990.04 → 3991.74] Our UV reactive hat.
[3991.90 → 3997.14] And of course, our UV reactive belt bag with high quality patches.
[3997.66 → 4000.36] And of course, all the style.
[4001.00 → 4001.92] How cool is that?
[4001.92 → 4003.26] But the answers vary.
[4004.18 → 4009.68] Anywho, once you send a merch message, it will go to Producer Dan, who will read it
[4009.68 → 4014.92] and respond to it or curate it for me and Luke to address.
[4015.20 → 4018.32] We don't actually have any new products to launch on the store this week, by the way.
[4018.82 → 4022.92] So yeah, I highlighted all the stuff that they wanted me to highlight.
[4023.20 → 4023.34] Cool.
[4023.58 → 4025.32] Dan, hit me with a merch message or two.
[4025.64 → 4025.98] Yeah, sure.
[4026.08 → 4027.20] We've got a bunch coming in.
[4027.54 → 4028.30] Hello, DLL.
[4028.48 → 4029.14] Thanks for the show.
[4029.14 → 4034.30] What is a subsector of the tech industry you thought would fail that has been quietly successful?
[4035.46 → 4037.78] Oh, I mean, you know what?
[4037.90 → 4046.32] I think that transitions us kind of perfectly into the shipping notification that Luke got before the show.
[4046.32 → 4049.12] Because you thought this would...
[4049.12 → 4050.44] Well, hold on.
[4050.54 → 4051.90] Let me let me go there.
[4052.08 → 4052.94] Let me get there.
[4053.14 → 4054.94] Not that specifically.
[4055.66 → 4062.54] OK, but I felt that high-end corded VR.
[4062.54 → 4067.58] VR had a very rocky path ahead.
[4067.70 → 4072.10] And in fact, I still think it has a rocky path ahead.
[4072.64 → 4075.10] There was a period there, right?
[4075.38 → 4082.96] Where corded headsets where you're kind of tethered to your desk or to your computer by your TV were the only option.
[4082.96 → 4087.02] And then, you know, adoption wasn't great.
[4087.40 → 4090.92] And the industry kind of went, OK, let's try and figure out this wireless thing.
[4091.10 → 4094.72] And then the first generation of this kind of sucked a giant donkey dong.
[4094.94 → 4100.26] And then it looked like wired was going to be high-end forever with, you know, outside in.
[4100.42 → 4102.70] And then, oh, whoops doodles.
[4102.70 → 4116.58] It turns out some pretty big companies were working on inside out tracking and were working on powerful processors like Apple's M Silicon that were able to drive pretty incredible spatial experiences with non-tethered head.
[4116.62 → 4118.96] Well, it's a tether, but it doesn't go to a computer.
[4119.08 → 4119.28] Whatever.
[4119.40 → 4120.04] Don't worry about it.
[4120.24 → 4121.88] But non-tethered headsets.
[4122.04 → 4123.54] And then I went, oh, crap.
[4123.60 → 4131.76] And then there were the rumors that Valve's Declared headset is going to be using inside out tracking and could have onboard processing rather than using an external PC.
[4131.76 → 4141.10] Attempts to handle the video transmission wirelessly have been have had varying degrees of success.
[4141.26 → 4146.24] I think the HTC Five and Five Pro worked pretty well.
[4146.24 → 4149.40] Other than that, it's been a bit of a mixed bag.
[4149.84 → 4152.56] I did get my hands on that one for the Index.
[4153.24 → 4154.90] I never got mine working.
[4155.22 → 4158.56] I reached out to them about, you know, helping me troubleshoot it.
[4158.56 → 4164.08] And then literally my sister died like two days before I was supposed to have my meeting with them.
[4164.10 → 4165.76] And I just like didn't get around to it.
[4165.82 → 4167.14] It wasn't a priority for a while.
[4167.14 → 4169.54] And then I kind of didn't get around to it.
[4169.90 → 4170.22] Happens.
[4170.22 → 4174.72] But a lot of people have had issues with it, even though some people have managed to get it working.
[4175.18 → 4185.72] And then we've had a bit of a stalling for a long time in the interface speeds of DisplayPort particularly and HDMI.
[4186.38 → 4191.08] Or I shouldn't say stalling, but we were just kind of we were on a cycle for a while.
[4191.08 → 4205.46] But then both of them like just got potentially way faster, but also DP UHBR20, which is the 80 gigabit one, I think, has pretty short cable requirements.
[4205.60 → 4208.72] I don't even I don't think anyone's even tried to implement it into a headset.
[4209.04 → 4212.62] But then meanwhile, headset resolutions are going way up.
[4212.78 → 4216.12] So being able to drive them without compression is like a challenge.
[4216.26 → 4218.14] So there's all these headwinds.
[4218.20 → 4219.62] Oh, did I mention the cost?
[4219.62 → 4226.52] There's all these headwinds for these like face mounted displays that use a tether and connect to your computer.
[4226.52 → 4241.42] And yet this man who never buys anything got a shipping notification right before the show from a company that is quietly fucking killing it right now.
[4241.90 → 4242.92] Big screen.
[4243.40 → 4243.54] Yeah.
[4244.04 → 4246.86] So you want to talk about what possessed you?
[4246.86 → 4253.38] What possessed you to spend a thousand US dollars on a VR headset that doesn't even include controllers or lighthouses?
[4253.56 → 4256.96] Oh, and I got the audio strap, which I'm pretty sure puts it beyond.
[4258.26 → 4259.82] I think it's even more than that.
[4259.92 → 4261.16] I got the custom fit cushion.
[4263.38 → 4264.44] I went pretty hard.
[4264.86 → 4265.26] Okay.
[4265.64 → 4268.56] I didn't do everything I could have done.
[4268.56 → 4272.18] But yeah, I got the big screen beyond custom fit cushion and audio strap.
[4273.18 → 4273.66] I.
[4275.06 → 4276.14] I'm very excited.
[4276.52 → 4278.52] I still have my.
[4280.90 → 4281.46] Index.
[4281.68 → 4282.00] Index.
[4282.12 → 4282.70] I don't know why that.
[4282.88 → 4288.16] This is why I'm surprised because he has you in spite of his enthusiasm for VR.
[4288.16 → 4294.82] I probably have two to three orders of magnitude more time in VR than he does.
[4294.98 → 4295.32] Now.
[4295.68 → 4298.24] You almost never use your index.
[4298.38 → 4300.76] I used it very well.
[4301.02 → 4301.16] Yeah.
[4301.20 → 4303.12] I use it very often in the basement suite.
[4303.58 → 4305.30] I use it like all the time in the basement suite.
[4305.30 → 4313.20] And then I haven't really had the space, but right now we're like renovating and changing stuff in the condo.
[4313.76 → 4314.56] There's some.
[4317.42 → 4320.00] That hasn't been amazing, but it's happening.
[4320.28 → 4322.06] I don't have much I can really say right now, but yeah.
[4322.20 → 4322.60] Anyway.
[4323.84 → 4325.00] But we're doing that.
[4325.12 → 4332.66] And what that will result in is one of the spaces will have a significant kind of area that could be.
[4333.00 → 4334.48] You could play VR stuff in.
[4334.68 → 4335.04] Nice.
[4335.04 → 4338.30] So I will have space to play VR stuff in again.
[4338.42 → 4340.08] Like have you even tried Alex yet?
[4340.48 → 4340.66] No.
[4345.66 → 4349.20] To be clear, personally, I didn't enjoy it.
[4349.30 → 4349.92] I didn't finish it.
[4349.92 → 4352.08] We are both heathens when it comes to.
[4352.28 → 4352.50] I know.
[4352.74 → 4353.10] Half-Life.
[4353.12 → 4353.60] I don't.
[4354.02 → 4355.74] I don't personally.
[4357.68 → 4361.74] Half-Life is not even in my top three IPs for Valve.
[4363.16 → 4363.68] Sorry.
[4363.68 → 4365.02] But.
[4365.02 → 4367.86] Not in your top three.
[4368.94 → 4369.06] No.
[4369.06 → 4369.68] No.
[4370.50 → 4371.26] Really?
[4371.90 → 4372.16] No.
[4375.50 → 4376.78] One, two.
[4377.52 → 4378.28] Easily.
[4379.94 → 4381.52] It's the third one.
[4381.52 → 4386.48] I would say that my top one.
[4387.10 → 4387.54] Ooh.
[4387.84 → 4390.28] In terms of hours played, right?
[4390.56 → 4392.80] My top one's got to be Team Fortress 2.
[4392.90 → 4393.10] Yeah.
[4393.58 → 4394.02] Yeah.
[4394.50 → 4395.88] The Team Fortress IP.
[4396.06 → 4396.86] That was the first one I thought of.
[4396.86 → 4397.14] Actually.
[4397.30 → 4398.46] Oh, that's crazy.
[4398.56 → 4399.46] What was I even thinking?
[4399.46 → 4399.64] Okay.
[4399.78 → 4400.14] No, I got.
[4400.14 → 4400.82] I got three.
[4402.04 → 4402.66] Left 4 Dead.
[4402.72 → 4403.24] I forgot that's technically.
[4403.38 → 4403.62] Okay.
[4403.70 → 4404.00] All right.
[4404.00 → 4404.38] Super Dead.
[4404.96 → 4405.88] Peak tier.
[4406.30 → 4408.28] S++++ tier.
[4408.48 → 4409.68] So it's probably not incredible.
[4410.12 → 4411.14] It's probably not in your top four then.
[4411.78 → 4413.58] And then we've got like Team Fortress.
[4413.66 → 4415.32] I have so many hours.
[4416.04 → 4416.80] I would play.
[4416.88 → 4417.64] I would.
[4417.64 → 4423.20] I would play Portal 10 times rather than sit through Half-Life 2 once.
[4424.30 → 4425.30] And then Counter-Strike.
[4425.54 → 4427.38] And yeah, Counter-Strike has got to be up there.
[4427.46 → 4432.88] Not because I like even especially love the IP even.
[4433.12 → 4433.62] I don't know.
[4434.04 → 4436.34] But boy, do I ever have a lot more.
[4437.34 → 4441.28] Would I call them enjoyable gaming hours when I'm just getting like.
[4441.86 → 4445.28] When I'm basically watching other people play for the most part.
[4446.34 → 4447.24] Hard to say.
[4447.24 → 4451.38] But if you told me you can only play one game for the rest of your life.
[4451.70 → 4453.82] It would 100% be Counter-Strike.
[4454.20 → 4455.58] Not Half-Life.
[4456.84 → 4457.28] Sorry.
[4457.68 → 4458.24] I can't.
[4458.72 → 4459.52] It's fine.
[4459.78 → 4460.32] I guess.
[4460.58 → 4460.72] Yeah.
[4460.78 → 4462.42] So would you say it's fifth then?
[4462.54 → 4462.82] Yeah.
[4462.88 → 4463.52] I guess so.
[4463.54 → 4465.34] Because I didn't get into Deadlock.
[4465.64 → 4466.46] That's for sure.
[4466.56 → 4467.50] Probably didn't get into Data.
[4468.06 → 4468.70] You know what?
[4468.76 → 4470.74] Probably didn't get into Artifact or whatever that's called.
[4470.84 → 4471.44] You know what?
[4472.68 → 4473.64] I'd have to put.
[4473.64 → 4475.02] So Data is complicated.
[4475.02 → 4479.28] Because I actually played a crap ton of Data.
[4480.24 → 4481.96] When it was a Warcraft 3 mod.
[4482.48 → 4482.60] Yeah.
[4482.64 → 4483.84] But that's not Valve.
[4485.28 → 4485.98] I mean.
[4486.14 → 4486.82] It wasn't.
[4486.98 → 4487.58] It wasn't.
[4487.66 → 4488.14] Well that's seen.
[4488.18 → 4489.74] That's why I'm saying it's kind of complicated.
[4489.88 → 4490.90] So in terms of like.
[4491.36 → 4492.90] In terms of like the gameplay.
[4493.90 → 4494.10] Yeah.
[4494.16 → 4496.32] I like Data a lot more than I like Half-Life 2.
[4497.20 → 4497.76] That's for sure.
[4499.22 → 4501.42] And I haven't played Half-Life 1.
[4501.52 → 4503.04] But I have played Half-Life 2.
[4503.14 → 4504.62] And I have played the episodes.
[4504.86 → 4506.46] The couple that they managed to make.
[4506.86 → 4507.84] So it's not like I'm coming.
[4507.90 → 4509.42] I played all the way through all of them.
[4509.54 → 4510.22] And they were fine.
[4510.28 → 4510.76] I guess.
[4511.06 → 4512.32] But even at the time dude.
[4512.70 → 4513.02] Like.
[4513.02 → 4515.64] When it was the War of the Next Gen shooter.
[4515.78 → 4517.68] I remember everyone was talking about Next Gen.
[4518.08 → 4518.50] Next Gen.
[4518.54 → 4519.62] It was all these generations.
[4519.96 → 4520.12] You know.
[4520.82 → 4522.52] It was Half-Life 2 versus.
[4523.38 → 4524.96] I always forget what they called it.
[4524.98 → 4525.68] Was it Doom 3?
[4525.80 → 4526.42] The one with the.
[4526.42 → 4527.84] The one with the duct tape mod.
[4527.96 → 4529.22] For the flashlight on your gun.
[4529.62 → 4530.60] Because you couldn't see anything.
[4530.72 → 4530.86] Yeah.
[4530.86 → 4535.26] I felt Far Cry was so much better than both of them.
[4536.40 → 4537.04] Far Cry 1.
[4537.32 → 4538.12] Unpopular take.
[4538.30 → 4538.94] I get it.
[4539.56 → 4542.48] Everyone else kind of picked up Far Cry later.
[4542.62 → 4544.12] Far Cry 2 was a piece of garbage.
[4544.70 → 4547.10] Far Cry 3 is apparently when it got good.
[4547.18 → 4549.66] I've never played a Far Cry since Far Cry 1 and 2.
[4550.42 → 4550.78] Man.
[4551.42 → 4552.06] Far Cry 2.
[4552.24 → 4553.96] I made me very angry.
[4554.08 → 4555.92] But that's a conversation for another time.
[4557.62 → 4558.76] The point is.
[4558.76 → 4560.88] Not a Half-Life fan.
[4561.38 → 4563.74] And we've gotten off-topic because.
[4563.92 → 4564.72] What was the topic?
[4564.88 → 4566.70] You spent a thousand dollars on a VR headset.
[4566.78 → 4566.88] Yeah.
[4566.88 → 4568.00] And you hardly ever use VR.
[4568.62 → 4569.22] I will.
[4569.36 → 4571.20] There's no way you're going to be in VR chat.
[4571.58 → 4571.90] No.
[4572.24 → 4572.98] So what are you going to do?
[4573.68 → 4575.78] I mean that's what most people are doing in VR.
[4576.02 → 4579.22] They're watching porn, and they are in VR chat.
[4581.50 → 4584.40] I'll definitely be getting back to playing Beat Safer.
[4584.92 → 4585.02] I.
[4585.26 → 4585.84] There was a.
[4585.84 → 4586.86] Is that the only thing you'll be beating?
[4587.20 → 4587.88] Oh my god.
[4587.88 → 4589.42] I'm just asking.
[4589.50 → 4591.44] I'm just asking where your VR space is.
[4591.50 → 4591.96] Is it in like.
[4592.16 → 4592.44] Genuinely.
[4592.58 → 4594.30] Is it out in the open or is it in a closet?
[4594.68 → 4595.34] It'll be out in the open.
[4595.34 → 4596.12] The people want to know.
[4596.12 → 4596.56] The balcony.
[4597.00 → 4597.62] It'll actually be.
[4597.62 → 4598.78] The people want to know.
[4598.90 → 4600.34] Open part of the house.
[4600.42 → 4600.66] I know.
[4600.72 → 4602.00] He never said no Porto.
[4602.94 → 4603.18] What?
[4603.66 → 4605.00] He never said you wouldn't.
[4605.08 → 4605.20] No.
[4605.28 → 4607.32] I can unironically say I will not be using it for that.
[4609.38 → 4610.32] I actually believe you.
[4610.32 → 4612.36] I can actually unironically say I never did.
[4612.68 → 4614.04] I actually believe you.
[4614.86 → 4615.76] I genuinely.
[4615.92 → 4617.18] I genuinely believe him.
[4618.22 → 4620.82] I will absolutely jump back into Beat Safer.
[4621.04 → 4622.22] I don't remember who.
[4622.42 → 4623.12] I don't remember the scenario.
[4623.56 → 4626.36] But someone played Caramel Dawson.
[4627.04 → 4627.28] Nice.
[4627.34 → 4628.00] Not that long ago.
[4628.10 → 4630.42] And the brain juice just immediately was like.
[4631.28 → 4631.72] Yeah.
[4631.72 → 4633.44] Like oh my god.
[4633.76 → 4635.88] Because when I play Beat Safer and I understand this is lame.
[4636.00 → 4637.36] I would just play that song.
[4638.34 → 4639.18] Just all the time.
[4639.18 → 4639.24] Oh dude.
[4639.32 → 4641.84] I get hooked on a song in Beat Safer all the time.
[4642.24 → 4642.80] Oh dude.
[4642.92 → 4643.54] Speaking of which.
[4643.62 → 4645.28] I bet there's some perfect maps for Golden.
[4645.38 → 4646.34] I'm going to have to check that out.
[4646.80 → 4652.54] Like there's no way that that genre of music has not been absolutely jumped on by the Beat Safer community.
[4652.54 → 4656.76] So I've been trying to use my little at home treadmill thing more often.
[4656.76 → 4656.98] Yeah.
[4657.24 → 4658.44] This is in that vein.
[4658.74 → 4660.22] I just want to get up and moving more often.
[4660.22 → 4664.82] So if I have a fun incentive to get me up and moving more often then cool.
[4664.94 → 4670.18] There's a bunch of like you know like arena games or various shooter games and stuff.
[4670.26 → 4673.20] You might not think shooter super necessarily active.
[4673.30 → 4674.60] Quite a few of them you can play with from your chair.
[4675.08 → 4681.12] But there's also quite a few where you can use like kneeling as a form of cover or benefit.
[4681.48 → 4686.32] And if you're constantly doing lunges basically then cool.
[4686.76 → 4687.48] So yeah.
[4687.48 → 4689.26] I just want to use it to get me up and moving again.
[4689.26 → 4690.30] How big is your space?
[4690.42 → 4691.14] Because there's...
[4691.14 → 4691.82] It's not enormous.
[4692.06 → 4692.30] Okay.
[4692.40 → 4697.14] There's an older game that is a heck of a workout.
[4697.48 → 4697.80] What one?
[4697.92 → 4699.02] It's called Hollow Point.
[4699.42 → 4699.60] Yeah.
[4699.68 → 4699.80] Yeah.
[4699.80 → 4699.94] Yeah.
[4699.94 → 4700.12] Yeah.
[4700.12 → 4700.62] You know the one?
[4700.72 → 4700.88] Yeah.
[4701.00 → 4701.48] Played a bunch.
[4701.76 → 4702.04] Okay.
[4702.30 → 4702.52] Cool.
[4702.78 → 4703.76] That's quite a bit older.
[4704.50 → 4706.10] It's older, but it's like...
[4706.10 → 4707.10] Is that the archery one?
[4707.10 → 4707.42] Yeah.
[4707.42 → 4707.44] Yeah.
[4707.44 → 4707.46] Yeah.
[4707.46 → 4711.28] That's the archery one in the gym with the scary knights that start charging at you.
[4711.28 → 4711.44] Yeah.
[4711.56 → 4712.38] We had that.
[4712.44 → 4713.74] We played that Hero Bunch, actually.
[4714.00 → 4714.34] Mm-hmm.
[4714.74 → 4717.66] That's in some of the like ancient VR reviews.
[4718.16 → 4718.62] It's Hollow Point.
[4718.70 → 4719.34] Hollow Point was sick.
[4719.48 → 4720.66] And very good for that.
[4720.88 → 4721.68] Lots of turning.
[4722.08 → 4723.88] Lots of ducking and moving and stuff.
[4724.26 → 4728.70] I think the space will probably be big enough to at least semi-effectively play that game.
[4729.34 → 4729.54] Cool.
[4729.54 → 4730.90] Not necessarily fully but...
[4730.90 → 4731.06] Nice.
[4731.44 → 4731.78] Close.
[4732.08 → 4732.40] Nice.
[4732.40 → 4732.72] Yeah.
[4733.56 → 4734.72] And it basically...
[4734.72 → 4739.32] It'll go from needing to move multiple pieces of furniture including a very large couch
[4739.32 → 4741.80] to needing to move a table and four chairs.
[4742.46 → 4744.08] Are you going to...
[4744.08 → 4745.16] Which is like whatever.
[4745.56 → 4748.02] Like is Emma going to try it at all or is she just not into it?
[4748.62 → 4749.26] Are you going to...
[4749.26 → 4751.34] She wasn't that into it in the past.
[4751.60 → 4753.88] Are you going to do mean things like put her in Arizona sunshine?
[4754.70 → 4760.74] Because I got to tell you the big screen beyond actually took anything resembling fun
[4760.74 → 4762.16] completely out of that game for me.
[4763.12 → 4764.90] It is too...
[4764.90 → 4765.42] Too legit.
[4766.48 → 4768.62] It is too real and too scary.
[4768.62 → 4768.74] That's exciting.
[4769.90 → 4771.34] M-Doss said Super hot is good too.
[4771.44 → 4771.58] Yeah.
[4771.76 → 4773.18] I've very...
[4773.18 → 4775.24] I don't find Super hot a workout though.
[4775.56 → 4775.92] No.
[4776.06 → 4776.80] But I really liked it.
[4776.80 → 4777.56] It was very fun.
[4777.68 → 4777.82] Yeah.
[4777.94 → 4778.22] It's fun.
[4778.22 → 4781.68] Super hot's probably the most like raw fun I've had in a VR game personally.
[4781.72 → 4782.06] Really?
[4782.30 → 4782.50] Yeah.
[4782.54 → 4782.94] I think so.
[4783.72 → 4785.48] I really like Super hot though.
[4786.16 → 4788.22] Like the like desktop video game version.
[4788.32 → 4789.14] It's a huge fan.
[4789.14 → 4789.74] Right.
[4789.74 → 4793.54] And then when I heard it came out for VR I was like that is the most logical like switch
[4793.54 → 4795.40] to VR I've seen a game ever do.
[4795.52 → 4795.74] Sure.
[4795.86 → 4797.08] And then had tons of fun with it.
[4797.14 → 4798.42] It was very satisfying to play.
[4799.14 → 4799.58] Um.
[4799.58 → 4803.60] All right.
[4803.64 → 4806.08] Well I hope you use it this time.
[4806.36 → 4806.58] Yeah.
[4806.82 → 4807.06] Yeah.
[4807.16 → 4808.44] I used it last time.
[4808.44 → 4808.60] Yeah.
[4808.62 → 4808.82] I know.
[4809.16 → 4810.64] I just stopped when I got to the...
[4810.64 → 4810.82] Yeah.
[4810.82 → 4811.04] I don't know.
[4811.18 → 4811.70] Because there's no room.
[4811.76 → 4812.26] That makes sense.
[4812.42 → 4812.56] Yeah.
[4812.56 → 4814.98] I have a bunch of hours on it.
[4814.98 → 4817.46] I'm sure you've passed me at this point like for sure.
[4818.06 → 4819.42] Because it's been years.
[4819.64 → 4819.82] Yeah.
[4820.04 → 4820.44] Um.
[4820.46 → 4822.48] But I had a bunch of hours in the past.
[4823.32 → 4823.76] Um.
[4824.92 → 4825.34] Yeah.
[4825.40 → 4830.80] I think another honestly a big reason is it's the same curiosity that drove me to get
[4830.80 → 4832.58] a lot of the really early era ones.
[4833.36 → 4836.38] Of just like it's a really cool device.
[4836.84 → 4837.56] It really is.
[4837.56 → 4840.82] Like it's actually kind of a marvel of engineering in a way.
[4840.82 → 4843.56] It's so light, and it's incredible.
[4843.80 → 4845.14] I finally got mine back.
[4845.22 → 4852.38] So I got a review unit, and it was really great but I actually I don't know if I was
[4852.38 → 4860.46] the first, but I helped them identify a hardware bug that I had in my review unit and they
[4860.46 → 4867.18] confirmed with me that it had been resolved and that everything shipping to a customer would
[4867.18 → 4867.62] be resolved.
[4867.84 → 4870.68] So I didn't bring it up in the review because it doesn't really matter at that point.
[4870.82 → 4875.20] That's the point of catching things and I fully understand that my role as a reviewer
[4875.20 → 4880.70] is also sometimes to find stuff and hey for the benefit of consumers make sure that it
[4880.70 → 4882.00] never makes it into their hands.
[4882.50 → 4890.06] But there was an issue with the radios and um at the speed that I move in Beat Safer
[4890.06 → 4891.30] the tracking wasn't perfect.
[4891.30 → 4896.90] And so I finally got my fixed one back actually like earlier this week.
[4896.98 → 4900.28] In fact I think it was I think it was because you saw the box in my car.
[4900.68 → 4901.88] That I mentioned.
[4902.04 → 4903.14] Yeah that you mentioned you ordered one.
[4903.20 → 4903.32] Yeah.
[4903.42 → 4904.76] So I just got mine back.
[4904.82 → 4905.88] I have not used it yet.
[4905.98 → 4909.56] So we'll be we'll be big screen beyond two buddies here.
[4909.68 → 4909.82] Yeah.
[4910.08 → 4910.40] Yeah.
[4910.46 → 4914.34] I've got it does that it has a tracking number but it is apparently hasn't actually been
[4914.34 → 4916.16] delivered to the place that has a tracking number yet.
[4916.16 → 4917.60] So I don't know the delivery date or anything.
[4917.82 → 4918.00] Nice.
[4918.18 → 4918.96] But I'm excited.
[4919.62 → 4923.72] But yeah it's its it's an fascinating device.
[4925.46 → 4928.70] It's one of those things that like to have you used one yet tech brain.
[4928.80 → 4928.98] No.
[4929.58 → 4930.52] Dude the resolution.
[4931.24 → 4932.86] Have you tried the vision right.
[4933.32 → 4934.04] I tried the vision pro.
[4934.12 → 4935.38] I tried the big screen beyond one.
[4935.60 → 4935.92] Okay.
[4936.12 → 4936.38] Okay.
[4936.46 → 4938.58] Your house for like literally five minutes.
[4938.68 → 4941.14] The big screen beyond one was really cool.
[4941.14 → 4947.52] But as we outlined in our review of it the the kind of glare off the pancake
[4947.52 → 4950.30] lenses was an it was a big challenge.
[4950.50 → 4950.64] Yeah.
[4951.24 → 4952.80] Dude they levelled up the optics.
[4953.00 → 4953.36] Oh for sure.
[4953.70 → 4957.90] I don't think you know that thing where we're like yeah watch reviews from everybody.
[4958.50 → 4964.56] If somebody made a review of the big screen beyond two there's an above 90 percent chance
[4964.56 → 4965.34] that I watched it.
[4965.60 → 4966.08] Nice.
[4966.58 → 4967.94] I'm sure you watched ours then.
[4967.94 → 4971.42] Yeah I remember I was getting like frustrated with you because it was taking too long for
[4971.42 → 4972.06] you to release it.
[4972.46 → 4975.72] That's because I was watching everybody's, and I was like where the hell is ours.
[4976.04 → 4979.84] I need to see all of them because I like didn't want to make.
[4980.20 → 4981.44] Okay there's the cheapness.
[4981.68 → 4984.94] I didn't really want to make the purchasing decision until I had like heard from everybody
[4984.94 → 4985.48] basically.
[4986.44 → 4990.22] So I there was quite a few reviews of it that were honestly perfect.
[4991.16 → 4994.40] And then I was happy once you finally released yours as well.
[4995.56 → 4996.00] Sorry.
[4996.00 → 4999.62] And then yeah I went for it, and I'm I'm excited.
[4999.76 → 5000.32] I'm very excited.
[5000.52 → 5000.88] Cool.
[5001.12 → 5001.34] Yeah.
[5001.60 → 5002.60] You're you're going to love it.
[5002.72 → 5003.48] I think so as well.
[5003.92 → 5008.28] Um I'm supposed to do the float plane announcements in a really quick now and.
[5008.44 → 5009.00] No later.
[5011.44 → 5011.84] Okay.
[5012.40 → 5013.66] What am I supposed to do then?
[5013.82 → 5014.18] Why don't you.
[5014.22 → 5014.88] You know what fine.
[5015.00 → 5016.24] Why don't you just do the show?
[5016.38 → 5016.98] There's a sign.
[5017.10 → 5017.82] Read the sign.
[5018.16 → 5019.06] Look at the sign.
[5019.14 → 5020.00] Read the sign.
[5020.14 → 5020.54] It's in.
[5020.68 → 5022.34] Don't talk to Dan.
[5022.68 → 5023.30] No that's.
[5023.48 → 5024.50] Oh I put up the wrong sign.
[5024.50 → 5026.58] Hold on.
[5027.38 → 5028.38] Don't make me.
[5028.38 → 5028.94] Pulling that.
[5028.94 → 5030.32] He's a scoffs words enjoyer.
[5030.66 → 5031.44] All right.
[5031.48 → 5032.22] We'll pick a topic.
[5032.84 → 5037.64] Actors who sold their likeness to TikTok for use in AI ads are.
[5039.06 → 5040.26] Who would have seen this coming?
[5040.50 → 5045.22] Having regrets after their likeness is used in AI ads.
[5045.22 → 5046.70] Back in June.
[5047.06 → 5051.72] TikTok announced a new set of tools used to make ads using AI avatars.
[5052.12 → 5054.52] These ads are supposed to be labelled as AI.
[5055.18 → 5060.14] Well actor Scott Jack Main from Dallas sold his likeness to TikTok.
[5060.72 → 5062.82] He was hoping that it would help build his career.
[5063.56 → 5067.34] He was paid $750 and given a trip to the Bay Area.
[5067.34 → 5075.20] Instead an AI avatar with his likeness has been selling stuff on TikTok as Steve.
[5076.12 → 5077.98] Scott's story is not isolated.
[5078.62 → 5080.92] Others have admitted to taking a similar deal.
[5081.42 → 5086.08] Most performers seem to have been surprised to see their avatars elsewhere.
[5086.76 → 5091.82] ByteDance, developers of TikTok, can use their likeness in third party apps it turns out.
[5092.16 → 5096.10] And people have been showing up on their video editing app Cap Cut.
[5096.10 → 5098.74] They also have apps for basically everything.
[5098.94 → 5100.10] So that's a...
[5100.98 → 5101.86] Not basically everything.
[5101.98 → 5102.92] Basically everything in my world.
[5102.96 → 5107.16] Dan, could we link the New York Times article to the people in the various chats?
[5107.32 → 5109.14] So that they can check it out if they want.
[5109.38 → 5110.18] Sure thing.
[5110.34 → 5112.10] It was pretty good and pretty...
[5112.68 → 5115.68] Yeah, pretty creepy and dystopian.
[5116.14 → 5118.98] I'm also going to try and start putting them in the description too.
[5119.00 → 5122.08] Which is I think what we should probably rename the WAN show to now.
[5122.78 → 5123.48] AI dystopia?
[5123.48 → 5126.94] Yeah, just creepy, creepy dystopian discussion show.
[5127.08 → 5128.74] Because that's basically all we talk about now.
[5128.84 → 5130.56] I'd love it if that wasn't true.
[5130.68 → 5131.56] Well...
[5131.56 → 5132.76] Yeah, wouldn't you though?
[5132.82 → 5133.56] That'd be awesome.
[5133.66 → 5134.30] Well, too bad.
[5134.38 → 5134.86] Get f***ed.
[5135.06 → 5135.36] Oh.
[5135.84 → 5136.72] Yeah, that's what I thought.
[5137.08 → 5138.54] This website goes nowhere.
[5138.54 → 5138.74] Okay.
[5139.64 → 5142.14] Yeah, it's because this is to...
[5143.14 → 5148.72] You'll have to find the article that is on the New York Times website.
[5148.92 → 5149.70] This was...
[5149.70 → 5150.52] Don't worry about it.
[5151.52 → 5152.74] A different website.
[5153.68 → 5154.82] Don't link this one.
[5155.14 → 5156.20] I did in Fouling, Jan.
[5156.34 → 5157.62] Let me just delete this message.
[5157.68 → 5158.34] Oh, boy.
[5158.48 → 5159.20] Way to go, Dan.
[5160.24 → 5160.70] What is that?
[5160.70 → 5170.18] Anyway, here's an example of someone who licensed their likeness to TikTok and...
[5170.18 → 5170.58] Interesting.
[5172.02 → 5172.50] Yep.
[5173.66 → 5179.52] Has just a generated by AI just, I don't know, doing random stuff on the internet.
[5179.52 → 5180.08] But...
[5180.08 → 5182.12] So, here's the conversation.
[5182.84 → 5183.62] There's actually...
[5183.62 → 5186.12] There are quite a few things to kind of unpack here for me.
[5186.22 → 5190.00] So, one of them, from my point of view, is why does TikTok even bother to do this?
[5190.02 → 5194.22] Because they could just AI generate a likeness of someone, theoretically, if they're doing
[5194.22 → 5195.26] this much generative AI.
[5195.26 → 5197.36] Can someone explain this to me?
[5197.46 → 5197.70] Anyone?
[5197.96 → 5199.20] I honestly have no idea.
[5199.76 → 5200.34] Feel free.
[5200.44 → 5201.10] Hit me in chat.
[5201.94 → 5203.26] People are literally doing that.
[5203.42 → 5205.38] Like, there's people on Instagram.
[5205.62 → 5208.36] Well, there are things on Instagram that aren't people.
[5209.52 → 5210.82] And they're not based on anyone.
[5211.00 → 5212.56] Well, some of them might be, but...
[5212.56 → 5213.96] But, like, why did they even spend...
[5213.96 → 5216.96] Like, would it cost them $750 in credits?
[5217.18 → 5218.04] Why would they fly someone out and scan them?
[5218.82 → 5219.10] Yeah.
[5220.00 → 5220.86] No legal battles?
[5221.06 → 5221.42] But if...
[5221.42 → 5222.18] What legal battles?
[5222.18 → 5223.04] Yeah, what are you talking about?
[5224.98 → 5229.60] Like, if they just generate someone that's not based on a real person, then what legal
[5229.60 → 5229.92] battle?
[5230.36 → 5230.58] Yeah.
[5232.72 → 5235.60] Yeah, it looks like there's quite a few people also...
[5235.60 → 5238.10] An AI-generated likeness can't be copyrighted.
[5238.60 → 5238.96] Interesting.
[5239.52 → 5239.88] Okay.
[5240.06 → 5247.04] And KG4WWN says, if I pay someone $700 to scan a real person, then nobody else can say
[5247.04 → 5248.56] it's based on them.
[5248.96 → 5249.28] You know what?
[5249.32 → 5249.92] That's fair enough.
[5249.92 → 5255.98] Because you could generate a person and the odds of somebody actually looking like that,
[5256.08 → 5259.78] given that the AI has to be trained on, you know, what people actually look like.
[5260.16 → 5261.20] I mean, it's not zero.
[5261.50 → 5262.76] It's actually rather high.
[5262.76 → 5267.72] Especially when you consider, to your point earlier in the show, how many people consider
[5267.72 → 5272.12] generic pale dude with a beard to look like each other.
[5272.12 → 5275.20] The amount of people that heard that voice and were like, whoa.
[5275.82 → 5276.06] Yeah.
[5276.06 → 5276.88] It didn't sound like you at all.
[5277.60 → 5277.98] No.
[5279.08 → 5285.82] I mean, I could kind of hear a ghost of what maybe someone could interpret me as sounding
[5285.82 → 5286.10] like.
[5286.22 → 5286.32] Sure.
[5286.32 → 5286.68] Sure.
[5286.82 → 5287.56] It wasn't good.
[5288.16 → 5289.02] That's for sure.
[5289.88 → 5290.22] Okay.
[5290.36 → 5290.74] All right.
[5290.80 → 5291.38] So, okay.
[5291.38 → 5292.10] We've gotten there.
[5292.22 → 5296.52] We've gotten to why ByteDance might scan someone and pay them a few hundred bucks for it.
[5296.52 → 5299.32] Now, let's have a longer conversation.
[5300.96 → 5301.66] What's your price?
[5302.58 → 5303.06] Oh my God.
[5303.82 → 5304.64] I don't think I know.
[5304.64 → 5305.52] Like, let's hold on.
[5305.60 → 5310.08] Before you answer, before you answer, let's start with one that you would definitely take.
[5310.72 → 5312.02] A billion dollars.
[5312.28 → 5312.56] Okay.
[5312.68 → 5312.86] Fair.
[5313.02 → 5313.34] Okay.
[5313.34 → 5313.42] Okay.
[5313.56 → 5315.38] So, we've established now.
[5315.52 → 5316.30] Yeah, sure.
[5316.72 → 5318.94] That like every man, Luke has his price.
[5319.48 → 5321.98] So, now he can't dodge the question.
[5324.60 → 5326.30] I don't think you'd do it for a million.
[5326.52 → 5326.76] No.
[5327.02 → 5327.22] No.
[5327.94 → 5328.74] Um, okay.
[5329.16 → 5329.60] Let me think.
[5330.66 → 5335.02] I like playing games where I demonstrate to Luke that I live in his head.
[5336.98 → 5339.82] It's a little ridiculous sometimes.
[5340.08 → 5342.54] But it's kind of fun to rely on in other situations.
[5342.70 → 5343.22] But anyway.
[5344.92 → 5346.10] You wouldn't do it for two.
[5346.38 → 5346.72] Nope.
[5346.94 → 5347.58] That's not enough.
[5347.84 → 5348.12] Nope.
[5349.18 → 5350.34] You'd do it for a hundred.
[5350.56 → 5350.76] How?
[5351.26 → 5352.70] You'd do it for a hundred, no question.
[5352.70 → 5359.98] I literally sat here, and I'd be like, like, ten seconds ago.
[5360.04 → 5361.18] I was like, I'd do it for a hundred.
[5362.68 → 5362.86] Yeah.
[5362.86 → 5367.78] Oh my God.
[5367.78 → 5369.14] You'd do it for ten for sure.
[5370.40 → 5371.30] You'd do it for ten.
[5372.04 → 5374.14] I want to say no now in reality.
[5374.82 → 5376.20] If the check's in front of you.
[5376.32 → 5377.34] If the check's in front of me, maybe.
[5377.54 → 5378.50] I think you'd do it for ten.
[5378.50 → 5382.96] I think the threshold is somewhere in the eight range.
[5384.06 → 5384.62] I don't know.
[5384.62 → 5388.52] I think that if they were trying to get a bargain, they'd try to grind you down to like
[5388.52 → 5390.32] five to eight.
[5390.72 → 5394.26] And I think you could, I think you could hold firm at five for sure.
[5394.56 → 5394.94] For sure.
[5394.94 → 5395.48] No question.
[5396.20 → 5398.88] I think as soon as we get into eight to ten.
[5399.66 → 5400.78] This is an interesting one.
[5400.82 → 5402.72] Because if I sell my likeness.
[5403.46 → 5404.98] It kind of fucks me a little.
[5405.02 → 5405.16] Yeah.
[5405.16 → 5406.24] How does that impact work?
[5406.82 → 5408.06] I don't know.
[5408.06 → 5409.24] Because, well, no.
[5409.36 → 5410.14] Try to draw a line.
[5410.24 → 5411.34] Let's keep pushing this.
[5411.96 → 5412.32] Okay.
[5412.54 → 5415.32] So if ByteDance is bidding, let's say eight.
[5415.70 → 5416.60] Can I say eight?
[5416.68 → 5418.06] Do you think that's at least you'd...
[5418.84 → 5420.22] It's in front of you.
[5420.26 → 5421.30] Eight is a tough one.
[5421.38 → 5422.14] Eight million dollars.
[5422.22 → 5422.94] I'm talking USD.
[5423.10 → 5423.80] I'm talking real money.
[5423.90 → 5425.08] Oh, that's a lot more.
[5425.42 → 5426.32] Eight is a tough one.
[5426.56 → 5430.46] If it resulted in like, I can't work here anymore, basically.
[5430.68 → 5431.12] Well, hold on.
[5431.22 → 5431.94] Let's get there.
[5431.98 → 5432.58] Let's get there, though.
[5432.58 → 5432.72] All right.
[5432.98 → 5435.22] So let's assume eight.
[5435.22 → 5437.98] Because at least we're having a conversation.
[5438.06 → 5438.26] Sure.
[5438.44 → 5439.46] It's not like the one.
[5439.70 → 5442.68] I don't think you'd even consider it for a second for one.
[5442.78 → 5442.94] No.
[5443.06 → 5443.88] Because like...
[5443.88 → 5444.10] No.
[5444.24 → 5445.44] It's not worth it.
[5445.48 → 5447.34] Like, look at what these guys are going through right now.
[5449.16 → 5449.56] Okay.
[5450.20 → 5457.30] So you come to me, and you go, okay, well, ByteDance's bid for, you know, my likeness is...
[5457.30 → 5458.66] Oh, this isn't even what I meant.
[5458.76 → 5459.90] ...is eight million dollars.
[5460.16 → 5461.80] You know, how does this work?
[5462.42 → 5462.66] Right?
[5462.74 → 5462.96] Yeah.
[5462.96 → 5465.16] Because I got to be honest with you.
[5465.86 → 5470.96] I'd have to work at Linus Media Group for a hot minute to make eight million dollars.
[5471.10 → 5471.26] Yeah.
[5471.38 → 5473.72] And this is a right now check.
[5474.14 → 5477.22] Right now, I don't want to retire.
[5478.00 → 5483.44] I love doing WAN show, and I love leading my teams and I love all the people I work with.
[5483.44 → 5487.44] And, you know, there's all these things that I really, you know, love about work, but...
[5487.44 → 5494.54] AI Luke is going to be selling, you know, health supplements and like, it could be butt stuff.
[5494.86 → 5495.60] Like, I don't know.
[5496.38 → 5496.66] Right?
[5496.98 → 5498.44] Does that impact...
[5499.16 → 5499.44] And realistically...
[5500.22 → 5501.76] They just own the likeness for any platform.
[5501.86 → 5502.72] It could be graphic.
[5502.84 → 5504.28] Like, I'm okay with the butt stuff.
[5505.22 → 5505.82] You know?
[5507.12 → 5508.30] And it could be graphic.
[5508.40 → 5509.26] I just sold my likeness.
[5509.26 → 5513.36] It's a very effective way to take medications, for instance.
[5514.18 → 5514.90] Or temperatures.
[5515.10 → 5515.28] Yeah.
[5515.40 → 5516.26] And they scanned everything.
[5517.20 → 5517.62] And I mean...
[5517.62 → 5519.34] I mean everything.
[5520.78 → 5526.10] Actually, that's an interesting additional layer to the conversation is, do they scan you
[5526.10 → 5527.44] with clothes on or off?
[5527.82 → 5529.24] And how does that impact on price?
[5529.24 → 5531.10] I can pretty much guarantee you there will eventually be ones.
[5531.10 → 5531.96] Oh, 100%.
[5531.96 → 5532.58] 100%.
[5532.58 → 5533.26] Where it's scanned with clothes off.
[5533.26 → 5535.26] So, I think...
[5535.26 → 5537.70] Dude, at that much money...
[5537.70 → 5538.68] At the amount of money...
[5538.68 → 5539.32] See, that's the thing.
[5539.42 → 5545.58] Is I feel like our principles and our thresholds would not be that dissimilar.
[5546.00 → 5553.94] Like, I would fully recognize that for you, I think I'd have to tell you to get the bag.
[5555.04 → 5555.62] But what...
[5555.62 → 5557.86] How does that impact work, though?
[5557.96 → 5558.26] I think...
[5558.26 → 5560.26] Because if you tell me...
[5560.26 → 5562.12] I think I say, look, we'll figure it out.
[5562.18 → 5564.18] Take the bag, fly free, little bird.
[5564.36 → 5564.88] No, no, no.
[5565.02 → 5565.44] No, no.
[5565.46 → 5565.70] Okay.
[5565.90 → 5567.74] I think I say, take the bag...
[5567.74 → 5568.60] And we'll figure it out.
[5568.60 → 5570.52] And we meme on it.
[5571.04 → 5571.56] Yeah, okay.
[5572.12 → 5573.18] Then I would do it.
[5573.18 → 5579.22] But I have to assume your contract stipulates that we can't, like, you know, shit on ByteDance
[5579.22 → 5579.98] for using it.
[5580.24 → 5580.96] Probably true.
[5581.06 → 5581.40] I think...
[5581.40 → 5584.18] I think, if anything, you know how I am.
[5584.64 → 5586.32] I'm going to try and figure out how to monetize it.
[5586.40 → 5586.66] Sure.
[5586.92 → 5589.36] So, we add, like, a monthly segment to WAN Show.
[5589.38 → 5590.08] I did.
[5590.26 → 5590.82] Blah, blah, blah.
[5590.92 → 5591.80] How is it going?
[5592.18 → 5594.44] Reacting to Luke ads.
[5594.44 → 5594.82] AI me.
[5595.06 → 5595.28] Yeah.
[5595.84 → 5597.82] No, in this scenario, I'm totally down.
[5597.94 → 5599.80] In this scenario, I'd probably do it for less than that.
[5600.48 → 5601.18] Oh, I...
[5601.18 → 5604.44] Because that sounds funny.
[5611.28 → 5612.32] That sounds hilarious.
[5612.52 → 5613.04] Oh, no.
[5613.40 → 5615.14] I think that could bring me down to the five.
[5615.14 → 5620.46] You're going to be a better negotiator in this situation than they would.
[5621.60 → 5623.82] They'd have to, like, give you a...
[5623.82 → 5625.44] Yeah, I want a commission.
[5625.66 → 5626.52] I want a commission.
[5626.90 → 5627.20] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5627.20 → 5628.86] I want...
[5628.86 → 5629.40] Bike Dance?
[5629.50 → 5631.20] I want half of what you saved.
[5632.24 → 5632.64] Yeah.
[5632.78 → 5633.74] I mean, it sounds fair.
[5636.54 → 5638.24] Because now that just sounds hilarious.
[5638.44 → 5638.68] Yeah.
[5639.88 → 5640.82] You're showing your hand?
[5640.88 → 5641.82] Yeah, it's not going to happen, dude.
[5641.84 → 5642.30] Yeah, dude.
[5642.36 → 5645.70] Bike Dance is not offering him millions of dollars for the likeness of Luke.
[5645.76 → 5645.80] No.
[5645.80 → 5646.98] They'll just find some other bearded white guy.
[5646.98 → 5648.10] Yeah, and people will be like,
[5648.10 → 5649.88] Oh, my God, it's AI Luke!
[5654.32 → 5654.76] 100%.
[5654.76 → 5656.06] Oh, man.
[5656.82 → 5659.08] How bad would an AI WAN show be?
[5661.06 → 5662.12] I mean, we could do it.
[5662.16 → 5664.06] I feel like it'd be an interesting video.
[5664.58 → 5665.70] They have those...
[5665.70 → 5668.00] There's, like, Notebook LM and all this other kind of stuff
[5668.00 → 5671.32] that can create podcasts based on information.
[5671.82 → 5673.62] So we could feed it...
[5673.62 → 5675.70] We could feed it every WAN show ever,
[5675.70 → 5680.02] and then we could feed it the news and the notes for the week.
[5682.00 → 5682.92] That would...
[5682.92 → 5685.26] I'd watch it just to see.
[5685.26 → 5686.56] I'd watch it with morbid curiosity.
[5686.72 → 5686.94] Yeah.
[5687.02 → 5687.74] Every once in a while, people...
[5687.74 → 5688.62] Like, I'd skip around.
[5688.72 → 5690.16] I wouldn't watch the whole thing, but, like...
[5690.16 → 5690.38] Yeah.
[5690.78 → 5693.32] Every once in a while, people link me those, like...
[5693.32 → 5695.86] Like a fake AI video thing of me
[5695.86 → 5698.06] or a fake AI audio thing of me,
[5698.10 → 5701.56] and I'll often check it out just out of, yeah, morbid curiosity.
[5701.76 → 5702.76] But it's not, like...
[5702.76 → 5703.98] It's not a fun watch.
[5704.54 → 5704.86] Yeah.
[5704.86 → 5704.90] Yeah.
[5705.36 → 5706.60] It's an intriguing watch.
[5706.68 → 5706.92] Yeah.
[5707.18 → 5710.06] That AI cartoon TV show one.
[5710.32 → 5712.40] Like, I watched, like, three minutes of it
[5712.40 → 5713.64] before I was just like...
[5713.64 → 5714.38] It's kind of gross.
[5714.60 → 5716.20] But I basically need to know, like,
[5716.22 → 5717.72] do I need to inform my family?
[5719.20 → 5720.08] Because every once in a while,
[5720.14 → 5720.60] all of a sudden, we're like,
[5720.64 → 5721.60] this is where we're at now.
[5721.78 → 5723.42] So be aware.
[5723.72 → 5725.26] A couple of people in float plane chat.
[5727.42 → 5727.78] Oh, shoot.
[5727.88 → 5728.06] I found...
[5728.06 → 5728.64] Yeah, Bobby.
[5728.78 → 5731.62] I think we can all agree 750 bucks is way too low.
[5731.72 → 5731.88] Yeah.
[5731.88 → 5734.48] I agree that for literally anyone,
[5734.76 → 5736.94] $750 is too low for this.
[5736.94 → 5738.14] But there's very desperate people.
[5738.40 → 5738.84] 100%.
[5738.84 → 5741.02] So I'm not surprised they found some people that would do it.
[5741.02 → 5742.74] I just think they should be paying more.
[5742.86 → 5743.22] I agree.
[5743.32 → 5745.66] I'm not saying those people should, you know,
[5746.16 → 5748.34] drive a hard bargain and potentially miss out on it
[5748.34 → 5752.40] if $750 is a situation-changing amount of money.
[5752.50 → 5754.82] I'm not saying you should have more principles.
[5755.16 → 5756.24] This isn't coming from that place.
[5756.24 → 5757.50] If it's a roof over your head or not.
[5757.50 → 5760.62] I'm just saying that ByteDance can afford to pay better
[5760.62 → 5761.22] and they should.
[5761.48 → 5761.58] Yeah.
[5761.80 → 5762.70] That's what I'll say.
[5763.26 → 5764.82] And then Raiden428 says,
[5764.88 → 5766.48] Linus, you turned down $100 million.
[5766.98 → 5768.00] So what's your price?
[5768.84 → 5769.58] That's different.
[5769.96 → 5771.84] I turned down $100 million
[5771.84 → 5774.86] because I was concerned about
[5774.86 → 5779.36] more than just my likeness.
[5779.42 → 5781.74] In fact, I wasn't even really that concerned about my likeness
[5781.74 → 5784.88] because the new ownership wouldn't be able to make me say
[5784.88 → 5787.84] anything that I didn't want to say.
[5788.36 → 5792.28] Like that was 100% clear in the deal
[5792.28 → 5796.16] that I would never be forced to be a mouthpiece.
[5796.32 → 5798.28] You know, one of the things that I explicitly brought up
[5798.28 → 5799.90] early on in the conversation was like,
[5799.96 → 5801.94] look, you know, we have our standards
[5801.94 → 5803.92] around the sponsors that we're willing to take.
[5803.98 → 5805.72] I'm not going to hawk gambling products.
[5805.82 → 5807.42] I'm not going to hawk alcohol products.
[5807.58 → 5808.70] That's never going to happen.
[5808.70 → 5810.34] And you guys are going to have to understand that,
[5810.62 → 5813.42] that Linus Media Group comes with the principles
[5813.42 → 5817.04] that underpin Linus Media Group as an organization.
[5817.18 → 5818.78] They were totally fine with that.
[5819.36 → 5822.86] The concern for me was more around
[5822.86 → 5826.32] losing the ability to steer the organization
[5826.32 → 5832.26] and losing the ability to ensure
[5832.26 → 5836.14] that we would continue to work
[5836.14 → 5838.72] on the environment for the team.
[5839.20 → 5842.62] Once I no longer have the final say
[5842.62 → 5846.88] on hiring and dismissals,
[5847.06 → 5850.58] it's possible for things to go extremely badly.
[5850.70 → 5851.80] And when I say final say,
[5851.88 → 5854.86] I don't mean that I exercise that on a day-to-day basis.
[5854.86 → 5856.62] I'm not micromanaging Taryn
[5856.62 → 5857.74] and the rest of our leadership.
[5858.32 → 5860.48] People need to have the autonomy to make decisions.
[5860.64 → 5862.62] What I mean is that if we are doing something wrong...
[5862.62 → 5864.22] He micromanages me.
[5864.30 → 5864.70] It's terrible.
[5865.98 → 5866.58] It's all a lie.
[5866.90 → 5868.52] We hardly talk throughout the week.
[5868.52 → 5868.70] It's all...
[5868.70 → 5869.30] It's all...
[5869.30 → 5871.04] We like to catch up on when shown.
[5871.10 → 5871.88] They know this.
[5872.84 → 5873.82] Such a liar.
[5876.32 → 5877.68] The point...
[5877.68 → 5880.84] Is that I would be...
[5880.84 → 5881.58] I would be...
[5881.58 → 5882.12] I would...
[5882.12 → 5883.40] I would be putting us...
[5883.40 → 5884.52] Okay.
[5886.04 → 5886.44] Sorry.
[5890.38 → 5892.00] I'd be putting us in a position
[5892.00 → 5894.14] where if we had taken the offer,
[5894.56 → 5895.78] months later,
[5895.78 → 5897.58] we would have gone through the August controversy,
[5898.10 → 5900.06] our revenues went down,
[5900.22 → 5902.48] and we would have lost people over that.
[5904.40 → 5905.26] That's not okay.
[5905.26 → 5906.32] Yeah, there would have been drops.
[5907.56 → 5907.92] 100%.
[5907.92 → 5910.00] Like, literally, I know the financials.
[5910.02 → 5910.40] Quick, fast.
[5910.56 → 5913.24] And literally, I have a pretty good idea
[5913.24 → 5917.34] of what a more dollars and cents,
[5918.06 → 5918.82] in and out,
[5919.46 → 5921.58] revenue flows-based management
[5921.58 → 5924.28] would have wanted to do.
[5924.36 → 5926.66] I think there's also got to be some amount...
[5926.66 → 5928.74] Like, I know that was your core reason.
[5928.86 → 5929.74] We talked about it a bunch,
[5929.86 → 5932.32] but I think we haven't talked about this as much,
[5932.36 → 5933.92] but I think it's come up at least a couple of times,
[5933.92 → 5936.22] so I'm sure it was some amount of the decision,
[5936.76 → 5937.92] was the...
[5939.14 → 5940.40] What would you call it?
[5940.44 → 5941.40] Like, lineage aspect?
[5941.52 → 5942.84] Like, your name's all over it.
[5943.30 → 5943.90] Yeah, but I mean,
[5943.94 → 5945.56] I think that's a heavy part of,
[5945.62 → 5945.82] you know,
[5945.84 → 5947.60] the AI likeness conversation, too.
[5948.38 → 5948.62] Right?
[5948.74 → 5952.08] Like, it's the legacy, I guess.
[5952.20 → 5953.12] Yeah, there we go.
[5953.18 → 5953.60] Yeah, the word.
[5953.70 → 5954.78] Not lineage, legacy, yeah.
[5955.08 → 5955.36] Yeah.
[5956.40 → 5958.14] And I think the other big one
[5958.14 → 5960.00] is that I didn't feel that
[5960.00 → 5963.28] the money would change my life that much.
[5963.32 → 5965.04] I'm already extremely blessed.
[5965.60 → 5969.10] I'm already extremely grateful to our community.
[5969.10 → 5970.68] That means that I, you know,
[5970.72 → 5971.74] live in a comfortable home.
[5971.82 → 5972.72] I drive a nice car.
[5973.60 → 5976.86] I enjoy a really nice lifestyle
[5976.86 → 5980.46] that I don't value.
[5980.46 → 5983.82] I don't value fancy labels on my clothes.
[5984.00 → 5984.46] I don't value...
[5985.10 → 5986.54] It's a pretty fancy label on that shirt right there.
[5986.54 → 5987.72] Actually, this is a wonderful,
[5987.72 → 5990.14] this is a wonderful design from Sarah.
[5991.08 → 5991.96] But it doesn't,
[5992.02 → 5993.38] it doesn't cost $400.
[5994.46 → 5994.74] You know,
[5995.08 → 5996.14] get yours today,
[5996.22 → 5997.30] lttstore.com.
[5997.42 → 5997.86] Heck yeah.
[5998.18 → 5998.40] Right?
[5998.50 → 5999.48] Like, I don't,
[5999.48 → 6001.18] I don't value a lot of the
[6001.34 → 6002.08] I don't value,
[6002.18 → 6003.22] you know,
[6003.50 → 6004.86] collecting fine art.
[6005.68 → 6006.62] Like, some of the things
[6006.62 → 6007.80] that people find ways
[6007.80 → 6010.22] to spend tens of millions of dollars,
[6010.46 → 6012.02] I don't value them.
[6012.62 → 6013.30] So...
[6013.30 → 6014.28] Fine art is often
[6014.28 → 6015.74] financial scams.
[6016.44 → 6016.86] Or like,
[6016.94 → 6017.78] like laundry,
[6017.90 → 6018.88] like moving funds around.
[6019.06 → 6019.58] Yeah, that,
[6019.64 → 6020.10] that I get.
[6020.12 → 6021.58] Or storing it without paying taxes
[6021.58 → 6023.24] or storing it
[6023.24 → 6025.16] while gaining tax benefits
[6025.16 → 6026.76] because you like
[6026.76 → 6029.54] donate it to a museum
[6029.54 → 6030.26] or whatever.
[6030.48 → 6031.02] Oh, I see.
[6031.06 → 6032.36] There's like a lot of weird
[6032.36 → 6033.58] mechanisms with art.
[6033.86 → 6034.08] Sure.
[6034.16 → 6034.74] So maybe I just,
[6034.84 → 6035.78] I'm not enlightened enough
[6035.78 → 6037.22] on the benefits
[6037.22 → 6038.84] of, you know,
[6039.16 → 6040.02] collecting art.
[6040.02 → 6040.52] You're a queer bro
[6040.52 → 6041.42] to do an art.
[6041.68 → 6042.06] But I just,
[6042.14 → 6043.68] You bring it to your other bro.
[6044.14 → 6045.42] Bro appraises it.
[6045.42 → 6046.52] You donate it.
[6047.40 → 6047.92] Tax break.
[6048.62 → 6049.32] There's a
[6049.40 → 6050.86] there's a lot of wacky stuff.
[6051.38 → 6051.60] Right.
[6051.72 → 6052.70] Obviously it's not exactly
[6052.70 → 6053.22] that easy,
[6053.32 → 6053.68] but like.
[6053.78 → 6054.56] And that's not to say
[6054.56 → 6056.02] that I have cheap taste either.
[6056.38 → 6057.12] I mean,
[6058.52 → 6060.18] I commissioned a solid gold
[6060.18 → 6061.38] Xbox controller.
[6061.72 → 6062.30] Which has
[6062.30 → 6063.92] been a wonderful,
[6063.92 → 6064.78] gained value.
[6064.78 → 6065.80] Wonderful investment,
[6065.98 → 6066.44] pun intended.
[6066.66 → 6066.90] Yeah.
[6067.20 → 6067.80] Um,
[6067.98 → 6070.60] yeah,
[6070.76 → 6070.96] I,
[6071.12 → 6071.76] oh man.
[6072.98 → 6074.16] So there are a lot of reasons
[6074.16 → 6074.98] I didn't take it.
[6075.14 → 6077.34] I still think realistically
[6077.34 → 6078.44] for like,
[6079.34 → 6080.32] AI slot me,
[6080.44 → 6081.38] I'd have a price,
[6081.54 → 6083.12] but the one stipulation
[6083.12 → 6083.72] that I would,
[6083.90 → 6085.30] I think I could hold firm on
[6085.30 → 6087.12] almost no matter the amount
[6087.12 → 6088.66] is that I would want it
[6088.66 → 6089.54] time delineated.
[6090.38 → 6091.36] So I would want,
[6091.60 → 6093.88] I would want some period
[6093.88 → 6094.80] after which.
[6094.80 → 6095.22] For sure.
[6095.48 → 6097.10] The license to my likeness
[6097.10 → 6097.66] goes away.
[6098.28 → 6098.86] And so I.
[6099.04 → 6099.88] The idea that I'm selling
[6099.88 → 6101.12] like alien soup
[6101.12 → 6102.72] in 48,
[6103.84 → 6104.70] 20 or something.
[6104.76 → 6104.94] Yeah.
[6104.94 → 6105.14] It's like,
[6105.24 → 6105.50] nah,
[6105.50 → 6105.96] it's not.
[6106.08 → 6106.22] Yeah,
[6106.26 → 6107.14] can we not please?
[6108.28 → 6110.12] It's ridiculously unlikely,
[6110.30 → 6111.44] but I'd just rather know
[6111.44 → 6111.94] that like,
[6111.98 → 6112.90] it dies with me,
[6113.06 → 6113.38] you know?
[6113.86 → 6115.08] Pinky Draws says,
[6115.20 → 6117.08] your taste is ironically tacky,
[6117.20 → 6118.76] but it's slowly becoming
[6118.76 → 6120.56] unironically tacky.
[6125.30 → 6126.08] I don't know.
[6126.24 → 6126.74] I think these,
[6126.74 → 6128.16] I think this WAN logo
[6128.16 → 6129.52] ear cushions are,
[6129.52 → 6129.90] are.
[6130.02 → 6130.78] I think they're kind of sick.
[6130.92 → 6131.64] Pretty cool.
[6131.86 → 6132.32] I like them.
[6132.86 → 6133.18] Okay.
[6133.54 → 6134.34] You know what?
[6134.40 → 6134.60] No,
[6134.86 → 6135.02] no,
[6135.12 → 6135.28] I,
[6135.42 → 6135.78] I'm,
[6135.78 → 6136.88] I'm going to get into it
[6136.88 → 6137.18] with you.
[6137.26 → 6138.14] I'm going to get into it
[6138.14 → 6138.50] with you.
[6138.76 → 6140.28] I want an example
[6140.28 → 6142.58] of my unironically
[6142.58 → 6143.52] tacky taste.
[6143.66 → 6144.04] Hit me.
[6144.56 → 6144.96] Hit me.
[6145.26 → 6145.60] We should,
[6145.64 → 6146.84] we should have like a.
[6147.36 → 6148.74] The entire portion,
[6148.76 → 6150.34] brand cannot be tacky,
[6150.48 → 6150.86] please.
[6151.06 → 6151.34] I am,
[6151.34 → 6152.76] I am not going to make this.
[6152.86 → 6153.66] I'm just going to be very clear,
[6153.80 → 6155.76] but we should have like a call a user feature
[6155.76 → 6157.62] for creators on Flow plane.
[6158.12 → 6159.26] So you could just be like,
[6159.56 → 6159.82] nope,
[6159.90 → 6160.72] you're live now.
[6160.82 → 6161.50] We're calling you.
[6161.84 → 6162.48] Just like,
[6162.80 → 6164.20] I'm not making it.
[6164.20 → 6165.02] Can we do that?
[6165.60 → 6166.00] Theoretically.
[6166.64 → 6167.52] Is that a thing we could do?
[6167.76 → 6168.24] I mean,
[6168.24 → 6169.64] you could use the same type of things
[6169.64 → 6170.50] that like discord users.
[6170.50 → 6170.62] Yeah.
[6170.66 → 6171.68] There's got to be like plugins
[6171.68 → 6172.30] or something.
[6172.42 → 6174.08] There would be ways to do it.
[6174.14 → 6174.74] We're not doing it.
[6174.80 → 6175.90] We have so many other things to do,
[6175.98 → 6178.22] but it would be feasible technically.
[6179.24 → 6180.62] The users would have to like,
[6180.74 → 6182.42] allow the mic usage and stuff.
[6182.60 → 6182.98] Like they would have,
[6183.14 → 6184.34] obviously they have control on their end.
[6184.34 → 6185.16] Think of the business opportunity.
[6185.28 → 6185.96] Do you have any idea
[6185.96 → 6187.50] how much more people would pay?
[6187.94 → 6189.06] Just for the tier
[6189.06 → 6190.62] that has the chance
[6190.62 → 6192.76] that we could possibly consider calling them.
[6193.32 → 6193.52] Yeah,
[6193.58 → 6195.66] we don't even have like gifted subs yet
[6195.66 → 6196.92] or TV apps and stuff.
[6197.28 → 6197.94] I think if we made-
[6197.94 → 6199.06] We still don't have free trials.
[6199.08 → 6199.86] We made that-
[6199.86 → 6200.66] Or even paid trials.
[6200.68 → 6202.02] For certain other features,
[6202.20 → 6205.36] I think the floaters would-
[6205.36 → 6206.82] Crystal's got her wallet out already.
[6210.58 → 6211.68] I think it's a cool feature.
[6211.76 → 6213.00] It would be very hard to make,
[6213.08 → 6213.50] I think.
[6214.22 → 6215.18] I don't think it would.
[6216.38 → 6217.28] I bet there's something
[6217.28 → 6218.92] we could basically plug in.
[6218.92 → 6219.96] Open source things are out there
[6219.96 → 6220.48] in that realm.
[6220.70 → 6221.76] Maybe there is good stuff,
[6221.84 → 6222.68] but I've never looked into it.
[6222.68 → 6224.00] I bet our buddies-
[6224.00 → 6225.66] Never once looked into it.
[6225.74 → 6226.68] What's the VoIP solution
[6226.68 → 6228.20] that we use for a remote LAN show again?
[6229.82 → 6230.58] Oh, T3?
[6231.16 → 6233.14] Yeah, we've mostly moved over
[6233.14 → 6233.86] to something.
[6234.26 → 6235.34] No, but that's what he meant.
[6235.50 → 6235.84] You're right.
[6235.84 → 6236.44] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6236.50 → 6237.14] We didn't change,
[6237.24 → 6237.60] but that's what he meant.
[6237.60 → 6238.34] No, T3 chat, yeah.
[6238.46 → 6239.22] No, not T3 chat.
[6239.22 → 6240.04] That's the other thing.
[6240.06 → 6240.88] Honestly, if we like-
[6240.88 → 6241.58] Ping.GG.
[6241.82 → 6242.92] Brought Theo in
[6242.92 → 6244.74] as like a thing
[6244.74 → 6246.28] and he could like talk about it
[6246.28 → 6246.86] on his channel
[6246.86 → 6247.74] making it or something,
[6248.02 → 6249.94] he'd probably just do it.
[6250.74 → 6252.04] And he's probably capable.
[6252.04 → 6253.72] See, this is what I'm saying.
[6253.82 → 6254.36] I actually-
[6254.36 → 6255.98] I think not TG, yeah.
[6256.10 → 6257.36] In modern era,
[6257.50 → 6258.08] Oh my goodness.
[6258.08 → 6259.60] I actually don't think
[6259.60 → 6260.26] that that's-
[6260.26 → 6260.96] Oh man, what if it just opened-
[6260.96 → 6262.08] That big of a technique.
[6262.08 → 6262.32] See?
[6262.58 → 6263.60] See, the gears are spinning.
[6263.82 → 6264.74] The gears are spinning.
[6265.08 → 6265.78] I think there's a way.
[6265.78 → 6267.42] I'm micromanaging him right now.
[6267.52 → 6268.50] I think there's a way.
[6269.36 → 6270.84] I just thought of a way
[6270.84 → 6271.46] that you could use-
[6271.46 → 6272.58] The T3 chat thing
[6272.58 → 6273.64] was actually an interesting one
[6273.64 → 6274.34] because I was thinking
[6274.34 → 6276.66] it had to be on the base platform.
[6276.86 → 6277.76] No, it shouldn't have to be.
[6277.76 → 6279.30] If it could just open another tab.
[6279.38 → 6279.74] Yeah.
[6280.30 → 6282.04] It would be like way easier.
[6282.28 → 6282.62] Yeah.
[6282.82 → 6283.78] Because I was thinking like,
[6283.92 → 6284.64] yeah, anyway.
[6285.62 → 6286.02] Yeah.
[6286.38 → 6287.18] Just some kind of
[6287.18 → 6288.08] automatic authentication
[6288.08 → 6289.94] and then uppity bop pity
[6289.94 → 6292.40] microphone pop up,
[6292.64 → 6294.46] maybe even camera pop up.
[6294.70 → 6295.54] You could theoretically.
[6295.76 → 6296.64] You could theoretically.
[6296.66 → 6297.60] That's very-
[6297.60 → 6298.50] We should never do that.
[6298.52 → 6299.20] No, we should probably
[6299.20 → 6299.76] never do that.
[6300.22 → 6301.08] Unless we have like
[6301.08 → 6302.56] a significant-
[6302.56 → 6303.40] We should have a tape delay.
[6303.56 → 6304.20] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6304.20 → 6306.04] Yeah, I think we'd have to
[6306.04 → 6308.02] finally have a tape delay, Dan.
[6308.08 → 6308.70] How hard would it be
[6308.70 → 6309.44] to do a tape delay
[6309.44 → 6310.06] for WAN Show?
[6310.78 → 6311.96] Not entirely sure.
[6312.06 → 6313.42] We have a multi-quarter thing
[6313.42 → 6315.18] which will do forms
[6315.18 → 6316.80] of like live replay.
[6317.04 → 6317.90] So, I mean,
[6317.94 → 6319.00] it's physically possible.
[6319.52 → 6319.88] Okay.
[6323.12 → 6325.74] Tim 000X3 in Muffling Chat
[6325.74 → 6325.94] said,
[6326.04 → 6327.48] I am very naked.
[6329.48 → 6331.20] That's why the webcam
[6331.20 → 6332.22] only goes to here
[6332.22 → 6332.98] for me too.
[6332.98 → 6335.00] It's all just cropped.
[6335.38 → 6335.96] Dan just does
[6335.96 → 6337.52] the WAN Show bottomless.
[6339.66 → 6340.22] I mean,
[6340.24 → 6341.02] it's Friday night.
[6341.12 → 6341.58] Come on.
[6341.64 → 6341.90] I mean,
[6341.94 → 6342.72] they don't technically
[6342.72 → 6343.54] know right now
[6343.54 → 6345.02] that we're not all bottomless.
[6345.34 → 6345.64] Yeah,
[6345.80 → 6347.02] I took the feet cam away.
[6347.36 → 6347.64] Yeah,
[6348.00 → 6348.74] so they don't know.
[6349.44 → 6350.00] They have no idea.
[6352.38 → 6352.86] Could be anything.
[6352.86 → 6353.74] Oh, man.
[6353.78 → 6354.56] That would be
[6354.56 → 6356.44] a whole other level
[6356.44 → 6357.42] of chaos
[6357.42 → 6358.36] for WAN Show.
[6358.36 → 6360.52] this is not
[6360.52 → 6361.44] necessarily
[6361.44 → 6363.02] real conversation
[6363.02 → 6363.68] right now.
[6364.48 → 6365.62] We'd have to have
[6365.62 → 6366.84] a more in-depth,
[6367.14 → 6367.44] more
[6367.44 → 6368.90] let's lay out
[6368.90 → 6369.58] all the potential
[6369.58 → 6370.32] problems
[6370.32 → 6371.16] conversation
[6371.16 → 6371.82] before we would
[6371.82 → 6372.26] consider
[6372.26 → 6373.64] anything like that.
[6373.64 → 6377.54] Dad just messaged me.
[6379.12 → 6380.76] That's actually wild.
[6381.70 → 6382.18] Apparently,
[6382.32 → 6383.32] my mom just
[6383.32 → 6384.28] benched 110 pounds.
[6384.28 → 6385.00] she could almost
[6385.00 → 6385.68] bench Yvonne.
[6385.94 → 6386.98] That's crazy.
[6389.04 → 6390.04] That's awesome.
[6390.92 → 6391.88] My dad's just
[6391.88 → 6392.68] been doing this thing
[6392.68 → 6393.80] where they'll
[6393.80 → 6394.58] rack weights
[6394.58 → 6395.10] on the bench
[6395.10 → 6396.18] and she'll just
[6396.18 → 6396.44] be like,
[6396.50 → 6397.18] it's whatever
[6397.18 → 6397.48] amount,
[6397.56 → 6397.72] right?
[6397.76 → 6397.98] And he'll just
[6397.98 → 6398.18] be like,
[6398.24 → 6398.46] yep,
[6398.58 → 6399.52] and it's higher.
[6400.54 → 6401.04] And she just
[6401.04 → 6402.30] does it every time.
[6403.32 → 6403.86] It's like,
[6403.98 → 6405.56] not a suggestion.
[6405.96 → 6406.92] Don't do that.
[6408.36 → 6409.08] But yeah,
[6409.44 → 6411.52] that's crazy.
[6411.90 → 6412.50] Considering her
[6412.50 → 6413.12] weight too,
[6413.24 → 6413.64] like that's
[6413.64 → 6414.26] actually nuts.
[6414.56 → 6415.12] That's awesome.
[6416.88 → 6417.50] All right.
[6417.52 → 6417.90] Heck yeah,
[6417.94 → 6418.10] mom.
[6418.18 → 6418.52] Good job.
[6420.56 → 6421.16] What are we
[6421.16 → 6421.68] supposed to be doing?
[6421.78 → 6422.26] Oh, yes.
[6422.30 → 6423.02] The flow plane
[6423.02 → 6423.44] announcement.
[6423.70 → 6425.02] This is a really
[6425.02 → 6425.84] exciting one.
[6425.94 → 6426.56] This is hardly
[6426.56 → 6427.44] even us,
[6427.64 → 6428.02] you know,
[6428.06 → 6428.88] doing promotion.
[6429.44 → 6430.20] This is just,
[6430.28 → 6431.06] oh yeah,
[6431.16 → 6431.76] this is just
[6431.76 → 6432.22] freaking out.
[6432.30 → 6432.46] Okay.
[6432.70 → 6433.84] Have you seen it?
[6433.94 → 6434.16] No,
[6434.28 → 6434.88] not at all.
[6434.92 → 6435.30] I've been waiting
[6435.30 → 6435.76] for it to launch
[6435.76 → 6436.08] on Slipway.
[6436.20 → 6438.10] It's so good.
[6438.40 → 6438.88] This was,
[6438.98 → 6439.88] this was peak,
[6440.02 → 6440.18] this,
[6440.26 → 6441.36] this series was
[6441.36 → 6442.96] peak Channel
[6442.96 → 6443.42] Super Fun.
[6443.86 → 6444.92] Channel Super Fun
[6444.92 → 6447.22] is off hiatus.
[6447.70 → 6448.36] Let's go.
[6448.80 → 6449.48] Let's go.
[6450.28 → 6450.52] The
[6450.52 → 6450.80] the
[6450.80 → 6451.60] temporarily,
[6451.84 → 6452.70] one video only.
[6452.70 → 6453.04] Is it a one episode?
[6453.18 → 6453.32] Yeah.
[6453.46 → 6454.28] One video only.
[6454.28 → 6455.64] As Scrapyard Wars
[6455.64 → 6456.80] reaches its midpoint,
[6456.92 → 6458.12] we want to give the team
[6458.12 → 6458.86] an extra week
[6458.86 → 6459.94] to finish up the last
[6459.94 → 6460.64] couple of episodes,
[6460.84 → 6462.48] but we don't want to
[6462.48 → 6463.80] leave our floaters
[6463.80 → 6464.68] empty-handed.
[6464.96 → 6466.32] So we've got you guys
[6466.32 → 6467.28] early access
[6467.28 → 6468.38] to the new
[6468.38 → 6469.32] Channel Super Fun
[6469.32 → 6470.56] video to celebrate
[6470.56 → 6471.62] us
[6471.62 → 6473.28] getting off
[6473.28 → 6474.76] hiatus.
[6475.98 → 6476.62] Or
[6476.62 → 6478.24] unless.
[6478.62 → 6479.76] Here it is.
[6479.76 → 6481.96] How hard is it
[6481.96 → 6483.12] to beat
[6483.12 → 6484.04] professional
[6484.04 → 6484.98] athletes
[6484.98 → 6485.74] Nerd Sports
[6485.74 → 6486.54] episode
[6486.54 → 6487.62] 10?
[6487.78 → 6488.58] I think they mean
[6488.58 → 6489.28] 6,
[6489.50 → 6490.72] but sure.
[6490.92 → 6491.10] Yeah,
[6491.14 → 6491.26] wait,
[6491.34 → 6491.84] why 10?
[6491.98 → 6493.18] Episode X
[6493.18 → 6496.04] Nerd Sports
[6496.04 → 6496.42] is back,
[6496.48 → 6496.68] baby.
[6496.96 → 6497.68] The Keyboard Warriors
[6497.68 → 6498.42] face off against
[6498.42 → 6499.42] professional badminton
[6499.42 → 6500.98] players Jenny and
[6500.98 → 6502.34] Gregory Mayer's in the
[6502.34 → 6503.20] most fair and balanced
[6503.20 → 6504.34] showdown in all of
[6504.34 → 6504.86] sports.
[6505.30 → 6505.82] Asterisk,
[6506.00 → 6506.58] asterisk.
[6506.94 → 6507.74] This competition is
[6507.74 → 6508.72] neither fair nor
[6508.72 → 6509.28] balanced.
[6509.46 → 6509.98] That's right,
[6510.04 → 6510.40] my friends.
[6510.44 → 6511.50] It's just like the
[6511.50 → 6512.42] old Nerd Sports.
[6513.78 → 6514.06] But,
[6514.20 → 6514.40] but,
[6514.46 → 6514.68] but,
[6514.74 → 6515.50] no spoilers,
[6515.64 → 6516.26] no spoilers.
[6516.26 → 6518.62] but I will play a
[6518.62 → 6519.46] little bit of it for
[6519.46 → 6519.86] you guys.
[6520.00 → 6520.40] Is the
[6520.50 → 6520.60] oh,
[6520.76 → 6521.40] do they have my
[6521.40 → 6521.64] audio?
[6522.82 → 6523.06] Uh,
[6523.06 → 6523.20] no,
[6523.26 → 6523.72] you're playing in the
[6523.72 → 6524.40] background as well.
[6525.06 → 6525.30] Yeah,
[6525.48 → 6525.66] but,
[6525.66 → 6526.40] uh,
[6526.40 → 6527.04] one second,
[6527.36 → 6528.02] one moment,
[6528.14 → 6528.46] please.
[6529.56 → 6530.00] Uh,
[6530.04 → 6530.60] am I though?
[6531.44 → 6531.80] Oh,
[6531.86 → 6532.04] yes,
[6532.06 → 6532.34] I am.
[6532.44 → 6533.06] There's the tab.
[6533.16 → 6533.72] I found it.
[6533.88 → 6534.48] Look at that.
[6536.24 → 6536.48] Oh,
[6536.48 → 6536.88] really?
[6537.86 → 6538.22] Oh.
[6540.94 → 6541.42] They'll just,
[6541.50 → 6541.74] okay,
[6541.84 → 6542.02] sure,
[6542.14 → 6542.30] fine,
[6542.34 → 6542.86] they won't hear it.
[6542.94 → 6543.52] They can hear it now.
[6544.02 → 6544.62] So anyway,
[6544.76 → 6545.72] I do like a coaching
[6545.72 → 6546.20] session,
[6546.26 → 6547.44] with my boys,
[6547.44 → 6548.72] um,
[6548.72 → 6549.48] and ladies.
[6550.24 → 6551.46] They see how real
[6551.46 → 6552.42] athletes warm up.
[6552.60 → 6553.90] They try their best
[6553.90 → 6555.00] to follow along.
[6555.42 → 6556.94] It's pretty great.
[6557.70 → 6559.40] They watch their warm-up.
[6563.48 → 6563.92] Oh,
[6563.98 → 6564.10] yeah,
[6564.16 → 6564.30] sorry.
[6564.38 → 6565.44] Here's my coaching session
[6565.44 → 6567.08] with the boys and ladies.
[6568.14 → 6569.50] I get them to try to hit
[6569.50 → 6570.04] some shuttles.
[6570.30 → 6570.56] It's,
[6570.56 → 6572.52] it's great.
[6572.52 → 6572.72] That's good.
[6572.78 → 6573.02] That's good.
[6573.06 → 6573.48] Do that again.
[6574.32 → 6574.72] Here we go.
[6574.76 → 6575.18] Here we go.
[6575.46 → 6575.84] Ah,
[6575.84 → 6576.60] yeah.
[6576.60 → 6577.08] Uh,
[6577.08 → 6578.30] and then we play
[6578.30 → 6580.04] and there are all kinds
[6580.04 → 6580.74] of fun things.
[6580.82 → 6582.06] I've got my wheel of pain
[6582.06 → 6582.44] here.
[6583.12 → 6584.58] I get to spin the wheel
[6584.58 → 6585.46] of pain whenever
[6585.46 → 6587.28] basically I feel like it
[6587.28 → 6588.50] and I can give different
[6588.50 → 6590.08] rackets to the pros.
[6590.48 → 6590.88] Um,
[6590.88 → 6593.60] they have to wear eye patches
[6593.60 → 6594.50] at some point.
[6594.50 → 6594.92] It's,
[6595.02 → 6595.80] it's a
[6595.88 → 6596.54] it's a laugh
[6596.54 → 6598.04] and Greg and Jenny,
[6598.04 → 6600.64] these guys were such good sports
[6600.64 → 6601.46] about the whole thing.
[6601.88 → 6603.30] They're professional athletes
[6603.30 → 6604.42] and so
[6604.42 → 6605.78] they can't,
[6605.84 → 6606.96] they kind of can't help it.
[6607.16 → 6607.58] Like,
[6608.06 → 6608.92] they want to win,
[6609.34 → 6609.80] you know,
[6609.80 → 6611.70] but we really didn't make it easy
[6611.70 → 6612.02] on them.
[6612.96 → 6613.60] That's the whole,
[6613.70 → 6613.98] that's,
[6614.04 → 6614.58] that's what,
[6614.76 → 6615.52] that's nerd sports,
[6615.62 → 6615.82] man.
[6616.46 → 6617.32] You got to find a way
[6617.32 → 6618.16] for the nerds to win
[6618.16 → 6619.86] or to have a chance.
[6620.00 → 6620.38] At least.
[6620.44 → 6621.32] We have to find a way
[6621.32 → 6622.06] for the nerds
[6622.06 → 6622.94] to have a chance.
[6623.04 → 6623.62] Got to be close.
[6624.06 → 6624.50] Um,
[6625.22 → 6625.92] I don't want to,
[6625.92 → 6626.96] I don't want to spoil too much
[6626.96 → 6628.12] but it's a great video.
[6628.26 → 6629.06] It's a great watch.
[6629.12 → 6629.98] You guys are going to enjoy
[6629.98 → 6631.54] the absolute heck out of it
[6631.54 → 6632.52] and I'm going to go ahead
[6632.52 → 6634.24] and set that public
[6634.24 → 6636.18] right now.
[6636.40 → 6637.32] We also
[6637.32 → 6638.80] have a behind the scenes
[6638.80 → 6639.38] that,
[6639.70 → 6640.44] um,
[6641.22 → 6642.38] is what?
[6643.30 → 6643.62] Oh,
[6643.78 → 6644.06] we have,
[6644.28 → 6644.52] yeah,
[6644.58 → 6644.68] yeah,
[6644.68 → 6644.84] yeah,
[6644.84 → 6645.54] it's extras.
[6646.62 → 6647.22] Okay,
[6647.22 → 6648.88] we have me
[6648.88 → 6650.86] playing the badminton pros.
[6650.86 → 6653.82] Uh,
[6653.82 → 6654.86] apparently this is
[6654.86 → 6656.14] about nine minutes long.
[6656.68 → 6657.40] I apparently
[6657.40 → 6658.52] shot a little intro.
[6659.26 → 6660.68] I was actually playing
[6660.68 → 6661.98] pretty decent that day
[6661.98 → 6662.32] but,
[6662.84 → 6663.42] obviously,
[6663.86 → 6664.40] they are
[6664.40 → 6665.66] literally professionals.
[6666.30 → 6666.80] So,
[6667.28 → 6667.58] yeah.
[6668.22 → 6668.96] You know,
[6669.06 → 6670.24] that sort of thing.
[6670.32 → 6671.30] They can just kind of
[6671.30 → 6673.36] dunk on me like that.
[6673.90 → 6674.62] Do you see that
[6674.62 → 6675.32] deception there?
[6677.92 → 6678.66] That's actually,
[6678.76 → 6679.62] that's not a bad,
[6679.74 → 6680.50] bad backhand
[6680.50 → 6681.14] but it's effortless.
[6681.18 → 6681.54] You see that?
[6681.94 → 6682.84] You see what he did?
[6683.22 → 6683.58] Oh,
[6683.92 → 6685.28] that was brutal.
[6686.60 → 6686.96] Yikes.
[6688.94 → 6689.30] Minus.
[6689.80 → 6690.46] Watch his racket.
[6691.36 → 6691.80] Oh,
[6692.24 → 6692.54] that
[6692.54 → 6694.52] sucks.
[6694.80 → 6695.40] And I hit it out.
[6695.60 → 6695.88] Anyway,
[6696.06 → 6696.24] so,
[6696.40 → 6697.54] we have me playing,
[6697.58 → 6697.78] uh,
[6697.78 → 6699.04] playing a set with them.
[6699.36 → 6700.00] Respect the dive.
[6700.20 → 6700.60] Thank you.
[6700.68 → 6701.10] Thank you.
[6701.14 → 6701.76] I do my best.
[6701.84 → 6702.02] All right,
[6702.04 → 6702.88] I'm going to set that public.
[6703.00 → 6703.16] Now,
[6703.22 → 6703.86] that is up
[6703.86 → 6704.60] on
[6704.60 → 6705.52] Flow plane.
[6705.90 → 6706.26] So,

[6707.42 → 6707.96] mainline video,
[6708.06 → 6708.72] will be going up on
[6708.72 → 6709.50] Channel Super Fun
[6709.50 → 6710.10] but the
[6710.10 → 6711.18] the extras of me
[6711.18 → 6712.00] playing them is
[6712.00 → 6712.96] going to be,
[6712.96 → 6713.28] uh,
[6713.28 → 6713.84] behind the scenes.
[6715.28 → 6715.96] All right.
[6717.46 → 6718.16] What are we supposed
[6718.16 → 6718.62] to be doing now,
[6718.66 → 6718.80] Dan?
[6719.66 → 6720.00] Oh.

[6730.12 → 6730.94] tech here on the
[6730.94 → 6731.44] WAN Show,
[6731.56 → 6732.52] there's a whole world
[6732.52 → 6733.30] of other topics
[6733.30 → 6734.22] we don't always cover
[6734.22 → 6734.48] that,
[6734.92 → 6735.36] who knows,
[6735.36 → 6736.24] you might even
[6736.24 → 6736.90] find interesting.
[6737.46 → 6738.10] But it can sometimes
[6738.10 → 6739.02] be hard to decipher
[6739.02 → 6740.54] which news outlets
[6740.54 → 6741.08] are,
[6741.68 → 6742.06] uh,
[6742.16 → 6742.38] oh,
[6742.46 → 6743.22] it can be hard to decipher
[6743.22 → 6743.96] what news outlets
[6743.96 → 6744.98] are actually saying,
[6745.06 → 6746.22] especially when their article
[6746.22 → 6747.54] fundamentally contradicts
[6747.54 → 6749.00] another outlet's article.
[6749.52 → 6750.24] With Ground News,
[6750.34 → 6751.06] you can get a true

[6755.68 → 6756.22] the cold,
[6756.58 → 6757.66] hard facts.
[6758.04 → 6758.50] For example,
[6758.76 → 6759.50] take this rather
[6759.50 → 6760.26] interesting story
[6760.26 → 6760.98] about someone from
[6760.98 → 6761.98] California who tested
[6761.98 → 6763.08] positive for the plague.
[6763.08 → 6764.66] Articles are gathered
[6764.66 → 6765.64] from multiple sources,

[6768.12 → 6769.28] then the facts are
[6769.28 → 6770.68] summarized in bullet point.
[6771.18 → 6772.02] You can also see
[6772.02 → 6773.26] that while the majority
[6773.26 → 6773.84] of the sources
[6773.84 → 6775.00] didn't lean to the left
[6775.00 → 6775.46] or the right,
[6775.76 → 6777.28] there are more articles
[6777.28 → 6778.20] that are left-leaning
[6778.20 → 6779.32] for this particular story.

[6805.26 → 6805.76] of the airflow
[6805.76 → 6806.64] while reducing noise

[6826.44 → 6827.34] and all the lighting

[6872.72 → 6873.18] on screen,
[6873.34 → 6873.82] or go to
[6873.82 → 6874.52] vessi.com
[6874.52 → 6875.46] slash WAN
[6875.46 → 6877.12] slash WAN show
[6877.12 → 6878.28] to get 15%
[6878.28 → 6879.46] off your first pair
[6879.46 → 6880.24] today.
[6881.24 → 6881.84] All right.
[6882.12 → 6882.40] What do you want
[6882.40 → 6883.28] to talk about?
[6883.34 → 6883.64] Luke, do you want
[6883.64 → 6884.50] to talk about something?
[6884.88 → 6885.64] We could maybe
[6885.64 → 6886.22] talk about something?
[6887.46 → 6888.54] Let's see here.
[6888.54 → 6888.96] What do we get?
[6889.04 → 6890.28] Intel grabs hold
[6890.28 → 6892.00] of $2 billion.
[6892.00 → 6894.56] Definitely an amount
[6894.56 → 6895.28] that I would accept
[6895.28 → 6896.30] for my likeness.
[6896.70 → 6898.32] Just in case anyone's shopping.
[6898.82 → 6900.38] In an ocean of uncertainty.
[6900.76 → 6901.88] After many years
[6901.88 → 6904.22] of rough financial seas,
[6904.52 → 6906.00] Intel's stock is soaring
[6906.00 → 6908.92] with a rally of over 28%.
[6908.92 → 6910.04] Wow.
[6910.36 → 6911.54] After SoftBank,
[6911.80 → 6912.84] a Japanese investment
[6912.84 → 6913.46] conglomerate,
[6913.46 → 6914.68] has agreed to invest
[6914.68 → 6916.64] $2 billion into it.
[6916.86 → 6918.18] Nothing ever goes bad
[6918.18 → 6918.98] after SoftBank
[6918.98 → 6920.22] invests into anyone.
[6920.22 → 6921.98] They invested
[6921.98 → 6922.94] into Intel's future
[6922.94 → 6923.90] in a commitment
[6923.90 → 6925.68] to advanced technology
[6925.68 → 6926.84] and semiconductors
[6926.84 → 6928.02] in the United States.
[6928.38 → 6929.42] A lot of the press
[6929.42 → 6930.56] briefings circle around
[6930.56 → 6931.26] the increased
[6931.26 → 6932.88] manufacturing of chips
[6932.88 → 6934.04] for AI
[6934.04 → 6935.76] in the US itself.
[6935.96 → 6936.30] Okay.
[6937.28 → 6938.08] This new investment
[6938.08 → 6938.92] comes after the
[6938.92 → 6939.52] Trump administration
[6939.52 → 6940.66] announced it is
[6940.66 → 6941.48] in talks with Intel
[6941.48 → 6942.38] to turn money
[6942.38 → 6943.54] pledged under Biden
[6943.54 → 6945.50] into 10% ownership
[6945.50 → 6946.44] of Intel
[6946.44 → 6948.66] just a few weeks
[6948.66 → 6949.64] after Intel's CEO
[6949.64 → 6950.88] took a little ride
[6950.88 → 6952.04] aboard the White House's
[6952.04 → 6953.70] metaphorical emotional
[6953.70 → 6954.78] abuse rollercoaster,
[6954.96 → 6956.20] which we talked about
[6956.20 → 6957.60] previously on Sancho.
[6957.72 → 6958.46] Not only that,
[6958.64 → 6959.66] but Trump has been
[6959.66 → 6960.92] strong-arming other
[6960.92 → 6961.42] chipmakers
[6961.42 → 6962.78] with requirements
[6962.78 → 6963.92] to AMD and NVIDIA
[6963.92 → 6964.96] to, I'm pretty sure
[6964.96 → 6965.88] they proposed this,
[6965.96 → 6966.84] not Trump strong-armed them,
[6966.90 → 6967.44] but either way,
[6967.76 → 6969.16] to AMD and NVIDIA
[6969.16 → 6970.30] to pay 15% commission
[6970.30 → 6971.64] on sales in China
[6971.64 → 6973.06] in exchange for export licenses.
[6973.18 → 6973.58] I'm pretty sure
[6973.58 → 6974.72] that was a pitch from them.
[6975.24 → 6975.50] I don't,
[6975.72 → 6976.76] I'm pretty sure AMD and NVIDIA
[6976.76 → 6977.10] were like,
[6977.18 → 6978.30] look, let us do this,
[6978.30 → 6979.50] we will pay you 15%,
[6979.50 → 6981.02] not, not the other way around.
[6981.16 → 6982.02] I could be wrong with that,
[6982.24 → 6982.66] but I'm just,
[6982.92 → 6983.32] I think,
[6983.68 → 6984.60] I think that's what happened.
[6985.04 → 6985.94] We have a discussion question.
[6986.32 → 6986.96] If the US government
[6986.96 → 6988.40] owns part of one
[6988.40 → 6989.22] of the chipmakers,
[6989.42 → 6990.68] what kind of malarkey
[6990.68 → 6992.06] should the others expect?
[6992.30 → 6993.04] Yeah, this is,
[6993.16 → 6994.40] this is pretty interesting.
[6994.70 → 6995.02] This is,
[6995.08 → 6996.20] this is one of those things
[6996.20 → 6996.62] where
[6996.62 → 6999.60] if it wasn't coming
[6999.60 → 7000.44] from the party
[7000.44 → 7001.34] of small government
[7001.34 → 7002.48] and free market,
[7002.86 → 7004.22] I would find it
[7004.22 → 7005.04] less confusing.
[7005.04 → 7007.70] But overall,
[7007.96 → 7009.26] I don't necessarily
[7009.26 → 7010.66] think it's the dumbest
[7010.66 → 7011.42] move in the world.
[7011.52 → 7011.68] I mean,
[7011.70 → 7012.64] we've talked a fair bit
[7012.64 → 7013.08] about,
[7013.34 → 7014.34] it's Norway, right?
[7014.40 → 7015.60] That has the sovereign wealth fund.
[7015.72 → 7015.86] Yeah.
[7016.62 → 7017.56] That's worked out
[7017.56 → 7019.02] pretty good for them
[7019.02 → 7020.36] mostly.
[7022.12 → 7023.02] I sent you that.
[7023.02 → 7023.56] If you're going to get
[7023.56 → 7025.02] a bailout of some kind.
[7025.12 → 7026.96] And how much better
[7026.96 → 7027.74] of a position
[7027.74 → 7028.66] would,
[7028.78 → 7029.06] you know,
[7029.08 → 7030.70] the American sovereign wealth fund
[7030.70 → 7032.16] be if the bailouts
[7032.16 → 7032.82] that they'd done
[7032.82 → 7034.98] during the 2008 financial crisis
[7034.98 → 7036.80] had granted them equity
[7036.80 → 7037.62] in those companies.
[7037.88 → 7037.96] Yeah.
[7038.98 → 7039.70] You know what?
[7039.72 → 7040.38] If you're going to bail
[7040.38 → 7041.08] something out,
[7041.28 → 7043.38] I kind of don't disagree
[7043.38 → 7045.22] that you should probably
[7045.22 → 7045.92] get something
[7045.92 → 7046.80] for your trouble.
[7047.00 → 7047.56] If the taxpayers
[7047.56 → 7048.68] are going to pay for it.
[7048.92 → 7049.12] The American taxpayers.
[7049.52 → 7050.66] The taxpayers should
[7050.66 → 7052.46] probably get the dividends.
[7052.70 → 7053.24] But, I mean,
[7053.26 → 7054.30] that's where we sort of
[7054.30 → 7054.90] run into trouble
[7054.90 → 7055.64] with this is
[7055.64 → 7057.00] what,
[7057.24 → 7058.24] pray tell,
[7058.40 → 7058.92] evidence
[7058.92 → 7060.64] are you going to provide
[7060.64 → 7061.86] that the taxpayers
[7061.86 → 7062.80] will receive
[7062.80 → 7063.62] said dividends?
[7064.26 → 7064.52] Yeah,
[7064.58 → 7065.52] it's going to go to like
[7065.52 → 7067.52] $7,000 trash cans
[7067.52 → 7068.82] for military planes
[7068.82 → 7069.26] and stuff.
[7070.68 → 7071.52] Womp.
[7074.26 → 7074.72] Neat.
[7075.10 → 7076.00] I thought you were going
[7076.00 → 7076.92] to pick good news.
[7077.32 → 7078.24] What good news?
[7078.86 → 7079.90] LZT has switched back?
[7080.38 → 7081.84] To 16 by 9.
[7082.46 → 7083.56] After years
[7083.56 → 7084.78] of releasing our videos
[7084.78 → 7086.50] in a 2 by 1 aspect ratio
[7086.50 → 7087.58] across most of our channels,
[7087.76 → 7088.58] we are returning
[7088.58 → 7090.26] to the very sane
[7090.26 → 7092.76] 16 by 9 aspect ratio.
[7093.40 → 7093.74] David,
[7094.24 → 7095.22] Mr. David Gauthier,
[7095.52 → 7097.20] why did you italicize
[7097.20 → 7098.44] very sane
[7098.44 → 7100.46] in this sentence?
[7100.60 → 7100.90] I don't know.
[7100.96 → 7101.52] I noticed that too.
[7103.60 → 7104.38] What are you,
[7104.38 → 7105.28] what are you trying
[7105.28 → 7106.40] to say, sir?
[7108.64 → 7109.76] We had chosen
[7109.76 → 7110.52] 2 by 1
[7110.52 → 7112.14] as a compromise
[7112.14 → 7114.20] between 16 by 9
[7114.20 → 7116.74] and wider aspect ratios
[7116.74 → 7117.56] like you would find
[7117.56 → 7118.64] on ultra-wide monitors
[7118.64 → 7120.58] or many phones
[7120.58 → 7122.20] then and now
[7122.20 → 7124.42] to reduce letter boxing
[7124.42 → 7125.48] on as many displays
[7125.48 → 7126.28] as possible.
[7126.82 → 7127.08] Now,
[7127.18 → 7128.98] hold on just a gosh darn second.
[7129.66 → 7130.94] But then we realized
[7130.94 → 7132.10] that was stupid
[7132.10 → 7133.46] and that users
[7133.46 → 7134.56] can zoom in
[7134.56 → 7135.08] on a video
[7135.08 → 7135.94] to fill their screen
[7135.94 → 7136.88] if they really care.
[7137.22 → 7137.48] Now,
[7137.60 → 7139.28] hold on just a gosh darn minute,
[7139.38 → 7140.14] Mr. Gauthier.
[7140.14 → 7143.36] we've never really worked
[7143.36 → 7144.18] with safe zones.
[7144.18 → 7144.58] Just a little bit
[7144.58 → 7146.04] of editorialization.
[7147.00 → 7148.04] We've never really,
[7148.26 → 7150.66] we've never really worked
[7150.66 → 7151.74] with safe zones
[7151.74 → 7152.72] and so,
[7153.10 → 7154.90] I felt that it was
[7154.90 → 7156.28] a simpler approach
[7156.28 → 7158.80] to have smaller areas
[7158.80 → 7161.18] of potential ingress
[7161.18 → 7162.46] on the top
[7162.46 → 7163.16] and the bottom
[7163.16 → 7163.76] so we didn't have
[7163.76 → 7164.62] to worry too much
[7164.62 → 7165.22] about like
[7165.22 → 7166.04] where are Mog arts
[7166.04 → 7166.92] and lower thirds
[7166.92 → 7168.28] and various graphics
[7168.28 → 7169.36] showed up
[7169.36 → 7170.72] in order to avoid
[7170.72 → 7171.86] things being clipped.
[7172.30 → 7174.22] But the main reason
[7174.22 → 7175.04] that we're switching
[7175.04 → 7176.14] back now
[7176.14 → 7177.08] is that
[7177.08 → 7178.88] Colton and the business team
[7178.88 → 7179.98] have been in talks
[7179.98 → 7180.72] with some
[7180.72 → 7182.94] like,
[7184.66 → 7185.00] I guess,
[7185.12 → 7185.68] what would I,
[7185.74 → 7186.34] what would I call them?
[7186.38 → 7187.22] Are they called OTT?
[7188.08 → 7188.80] Like the
[7189.02 → 7189.50] the
[7190.10 → 7190.62] like T,
[7190.76 → 7191.50] like basically
[7191.50 → 7193.40] like TV channel feeds,
[7193.54 → 7194.48] like app-based,
[7194.94 → 7196.34] app-based feeds
[7196.34 → 7197.64] of content feeds.
[7197.64 → 7198.30] I can't remember.
[7198.42 → 7198.78] OTA?
[7199.10 → 7199.62] No, not OTA.
[7199.62 → 7201.72] Over the set-up.
[7202.22 → 7202.44] Like,
[7202.60 → 7203.78] I think it's OTT.
[7204.12 → 7204.66] Is it OTT?
[7204.82 → 7205.20] Well, whatever.
[7205.30 → 7205.82] The point is,
[7205.82 → 7206.58] over the top.
[7206.76 → 7208.08] They want 16 by nine
[7208.08 → 7210.00] and so now
[7210.00 → 7210.72] we're going back
[7210.72 → 7211.74] through our entire
[7211.74 → 7213.24] catalogue of content
[7213.24 → 7213.56] and going,
[7213.72 → 7214.00] oh,
[7214.10 → 7215.08] whoops.
[7215.08 → 7218.72] Fast!
[7218.86 → 7219.30] That's it.
[7219.40 → 7219.96] Free ad support
[7219.96 → 7220.58] is streaming today.
[7220.68 → 7221.06] That's it.
[7221.16 → 7222.04] That's it for sure.
[7222.26 → 7222.68] Thank you.
[7223.78 → 7224.26] Marrano?
[7224.74 → 7225.02] So,
[7225.82 → 7226.54] yeah,
[7226.80 → 7227.00] we're,
[7227.16 → 7227.78] so we're going back
[7227.78 → 7228.70] to 16 by nine
[7228.70 → 7229.42] and we're probably
[7229.42 → 7230.52] just going to have to
[7230.52 → 7231.74] start using safe zones.
[7231.86 → 7232.00] Yes,
[7232.08 → 7232.60] Daniel Lesser
[7232.60 → 7234.24] who apparently
[7234.24 → 7235.68] lost his
[7235.68 → 7238.68] talking privileges
[7238.68 → 7239.34] or something
[7239.34 → 7240.26] so he wrote it
[7240.26 → 7240.74] like this
[7240.74 → 7241.54] on the doc
[7241.54 → 7242.56] instead of just
[7242.56 → 7243.26] saying it.
[7244.58 → 7245.06] Well,
[7245.08 → 7245.52] to be fair,
[7245.54 → 7245.94] it was like
[7245.94 → 7246.52] a merch message
[7246.52 → 7246.90] earlier
[7246.90 → 7247.38] so I thought
[7247.38 → 7248.02] you would just
[7248.02 → 7250.52] pop in some discussion
[7250.52 → 7250.86] with that.
[7250.88 → 7251.22] That's fine,
[7251.28 → 7252.06] you can write a message
[7252.06 → 7252.58] if you like.
[7252.66 → 7253.12] I'm just saying
[7253.12 → 7253.62] you could also
[7253.62 → 7254.26] talk to us.
[7254.48 → 7254.72] No.
[7255.10 → 7255.74] Just whatever you do,
[7255.86 → 7257.30] don't let DMS talk.
[7257.46 → 7258.26] Make him sit there.
[7259.88 → 7260.46] Stop it!
[7261.30 → 7261.52] Shit!
[7262.20 → 7262.30] No!
[7263.08 → 7263.30] All right!
[7266.14 → 7266.70] Don't hit me!
[7266.80 → 7267.16] No, stop!
[7269.26 → 7270.18] I'm just realizing
[7270.18 → 7271.00] Dan can really
[7271.00 → 7271.76] just voice act
[7271.76 → 7272.42] anything that's
[7272.42 → 7273.10] happening back there.
[7274.10 → 7274.80] Don't say it
[7274.80 → 7275.46] like that!
[7276.92 → 7277.92] I will not!
[7278.78 → 7279.56] You don't pay me
[7279.56 → 7280.26] enough for that.
[7281.18 → 7281.86] Oh my god.
[7281.88 → 7282.94] We have to buy his
[7282.94 → 7283.46] likeness.
[7284.96 → 7285.28] Okay.
[7285.36 → 7285.70] Five bucks.
[7285.76 → 7286.18] Final offer,
[7286.32 → 7287.00] 750.
[7287.24 → 7288.00] Oh, okay.
[7288.20 → 7289.16] Sir, five bucks.
[7289.26 → 7289.92] I would do that.
[7290.00 → 7290.54] I would buy your
[7290.54 → 7291.44] likeness for five bucks.
[7291.74 → 7291.96] I don't know
[7291.96 → 7292.46] what I'd do with it.
[7292.46 → 7293.08] It's only going to
[7293.08 → 7293.38] one of you
[7293.38 → 7293.90] bidding more times.
[7293.96 → 7294.40] I can figure it.
[7294.48 → 7294.72] Oh.
[7295.32 → 7296.54] See, I'm a business.
[7296.54 → 7297.76] I'd only pay you
[7297.76 → 7298.56] Tuesday for your
[7298.56 → 7299.36] likeness today.
[7301.46 → 7302.32] Pixel peeping
[7302.32 → 7303.26] the new Pixels.
[7303.96 → 7304.70] Google had their
[7304.70 → 7305.48] Made by Google
[7305.48 → 7306.46] 25 event
[7306.46 → 7307.82] in which they
[7307.82 → 7308.28] announced several
[7308.28 → 7308.80] new devices.
[7309.40 → 7309.86] The Pixel 10,
[7309.94 → 7310.50] Pixel 10 Pro,
[7310.60 → 7311.62] Pixel 10 Pro XL,
[7311.78 → 7312.64] Pixel 10 Pro Fold,
[7312.74 → 7313.76] Pixel Buds 2a,
[7313.88 → 7316.24] and Pixel Watch 4.
[7316.48 → 7316.74] Wow.
[7316.96 → 7317.84] The phones feature
[7317.84 → 7318.36] their new
[7318.36 → 7319.38] Tensor G5 chip,
[7319.46 → 7319.92] which according to
[7319.92 → 7321.24] Google has 60%
[7321.24 → 7322.36] more power on the
[7322.36 → 7322.98] TPU,
[7322.98 → 7324.94] and is 34%
[7324.94 → 7326.22] faster on CPU
[7326.22 → 7327.30] compared to last
[7327.30 → 7328.46] year's Tensor G4 chip.
[7328.88 → 7329.74] The Pixel 10,
[7330.04 → 7330.80] except the full
[7330.80 → 7331.22] lineup,
[7331.36 → 7332.64] will be eSIM only
[7332.64 → 7333.42] for the US models
[7333.42 → 7334.38] while other regions
[7334.38 → 7335.00] will retain their
[7335.00 → 7335.72] physical SIM trays.
[7336.26 → 7337.20] And the Pixel 10 Pro
[7337.20 → 7338.30] Fold is the first
[7338.30 → 7339.02] foldable with an
[7339.02 → 7340.28] IP68 rating,
[7340.38 → 7341.54] meaning it has
[7341.54 → 7343.36] pretty solid dust
[7343.36 → 7344.32] and water resistance.
[7344.76 → 7345.28] Would have come in
[7345.28 → 7345.92] handy for me once.
[7346.44 → 7347.22] Yep, I can remember
[7347.22 → 7347.42] that.
[7348.08 → 7349.14] Google also announced
[7349.14 → 7349.86] that their devices
[7349.86 → 7351.02] are getting Pixel
[7351.02 → 7351.44] Snap,
[7351.60 → 7352.60] which is basically
[7352.60 → 7353.38] using the new
[7353.38 → 7354.12] Qi 2 wireless
[7354.12 → 7354.80] charging standard
[7354.80 → 7356.08] that allows snapping
[7356.08 → 7357.24] of magnetic accessories
[7357.24 → 7358.42] to the back of the
[7358.42 → 7358.86] device.
[7359.10 → 7359.26] Okay.
[7359.60 → 7360.28] Google is launching
[7360.28 → 7361.26] some of their own
[7361.26 → 7361.76] as well,
[7361.82 → 7362.26] like the Pixel
[7362.26 → 7362.80] Snap charger,
[7362.92 → 7363.62] Pixel Snap cases,
[7363.88 → 7364.36] and Pixel
[7364.36 → 7365.32] Snap ring stand.
[7365.44 → 7366.18] Why don't you care
[7366.18 → 7366.84] about MagSafe?
[7367.10 → 7367.28] No.
[7367.58 → 7368.08] Sorry, Pixel
[7368.08 → 7368.90] Snap, excuse me.
[7369.28 → 7369.92] That's why.
[7370.58 → 7371.00] It's like,
[7371.10 → 7371.82] oh, they're finally
[7371.82 → 7372.50] catching up.
[7372.62 → 7373.40] I mean, it's a big
[7373.40 → 7374.82] feature for iPhone
[7374.82 → 7375.20] people.
[7375.60 → 7377.08] I personally don't
[7377.08 → 7377.88] have too many
[7377.88 → 7378.64] occasions where I
[7378.64 → 7379.46] need to magnetically
[7379.46 → 7380.22] attach my phone to
[7380.22 → 7380.40] stuff.
[7380.48 → 7381.16] Maybe I'm just
[7381.16 → 7382.38] thinking inside the
[7382.38 → 7382.74] box.
[7382.74 → 7382.96] The ecosystem,
[7383.12 → 7383.32] yeah.
[7384.16 → 7385.10] When would I do
[7385.10 → 7385.28] that?
[7385.36 → 7385.74] Should I do it
[7385.74 → 7385.96] now?
[7386.08 → 7386.88] Should I stick it
[7386.88 → 7387.20] to something?
[7387.42 → 7387.58] Like I,
[7388.62 → 7389.46] my phone lives in
[7389.46 → 7389.96] my pocket.
[7391.32 → 7391.66] Yeah.
[7393.04 → 7393.44] Yeah.
[7393.88 → 7394.50] You know what?
[7394.54 → 7394.72] No.
[7395.48 → 7395.88] I lied.
[7395.88 → 7396.58] I lied.
[7396.66 → 7397.06] My minivan.
[7397.74 → 7397.98] Yeah.
[7398.20 → 7398.74] My minivan
[7398.74 → 7399.58] doesn't have
[7399.58 → 7400.20] Android Auto.
[7400.42 → 7401.28] So if I,
[7401.28 → 7402.32] if I had a magnetic
[7402.32 → 7403.08] doodad,
[7403.20 → 7403.60] I'd, probably.
[7403.64 → 7404.08] It's nicer than
[7404.08 → 7405.06] clamping it in.
[7405.16 → 7405.30] Yeah.
[7405.50 → 7406.10] Yeah, I'd probably do that.
[7406.10 → 7407.14] They also actively
[7407.14 → 7407.76] charge,
[7407.90 → 7408.70] so it's easier to
[7408.70 → 7409.64] just like toss it
[7409.64 → 7410.20] on a thing when
[7410.20 → 7410.56] it's going to
[7410.56 → 7411.30] magnetize to the
[7411.30 → 7411.80] right spot.
[7412.94 → 7413.38] Okay.
[7414.02 → 7414.66] I think it's cool.
[7414.70 → 7415.34] I still use a cable
[7415.34 → 7415.78] to charge.
[7416.40 → 7416.64] Yeah.
[7417.32 → 7418.20] Maybe because we're
[7418.20 → 7419.56] Google boomers.
[7421.96 → 7422.88] Google boomers.
[7423.04 → 7423.24] Yeah.
[7423.68 → 7424.34] This is a thing?
[7424.50 → 7425.74] Are we making this a thing?
[7425.74 → 7425.94] Yeah.
[7426.36 → 7426.92] No, the reason,
[7427.00 → 7428.16] the reason I use my
[7428.16 → 7428.90] cable is because
[7428.90 → 7429.80] I have my phone
[7429.80 → 7431.54] in bed next to me
[7431.54 → 7432.72] because I listen
[7432.72 → 7434.10] to my Bluetooth earphones
[7434.10 → 7434.94] and because Plex
[7434.94 → 7435.80] is a giant piece
[7435.80 → 7436.48] of s**t.
[7436.64 → 7437.76] Phone doesn't need
[7437.76 → 7438.50] to be in bed
[7438.50 → 7438.92] with you.
[7439.02 → 7440.02] My, well,
[7440.08 → 7441.84] no, because my video
[7441.84 → 7442.98] stops all the time
[7442.98 → 7444.26] because Plex
[7444.26 → 7445.10] is a giant piece
[7445.10 → 7445.84] of s**t.
[7446.32 → 7446.90] Have you,
[7446.96 → 7447.64] have you thought
[7447.64 → 7448.54] about Jelly Winning?
[7448.88 → 7449.36] I have.
[7449.98 → 7451.46] I am going to wait
[7451.46 → 7453.30] until Stag
[7453.30 → 7454.26] gets their
[7454.26 → 7455.56] Hexes integration
[7455.56 → 7456.32] with Jelly Fin
[7456.32 → 7458.76] and then I am
[7458.76 → 7459.60] just going to
[7459.60 → 7460.78] have it be easy.
[7461.96 → 7462.20] Yep.
[7462.50 → 7462.92] It's,
[7462.92 → 7463.64] it's amazing
[7463.64 → 7464.94] how many years
[7464.94 → 7467.10] Plex has just
[7467.10 → 7467.90] like not been able
[7467.90 → 7468.86] to just indefinitely
[7468.86 → 7469.38] play video.
[7470.18 → 7471.00] Like there's no,
[7471.26 → 7472.08] like there's no reason
[7472.08 → 7472.52] for it.
[7472.58 → 7472.72] You know,
[7472.74 → 7473.44] it's not like Netflix
[7473.44 → 7473.92] where it's like,
[7473.96 → 7474.06] yeah,
[7474.06 → 7474.58] at some point
[7474.58 → 7474.98] they're probably
[7474.98 → 7475.50] not watching
[7475.50 → 7476.18] so we should save
[7476.18 → 7476.48] bandwidth.
[7476.48 → 7477.82] Like it's my bandwidth
[7477.82 → 7479.32] on my Wi-Fi.
[7479.44 → 7480.18] You shouldn't care.
[7480.58 → 7480.70] Yeah.
[7481.20 → 7482.26] Like years and years
[7482.26 → 7482.78] and years ago
[7482.78 → 7483.36] I would,
[7483.60 → 7484.54] I would wake up
[7484.54 → 7485.00] in the morning
[7485.00 → 7486.04] and like my show
[7486.04 → 7486.98] would still be playing.
[7487.78 → 7488.54] These days
[7488.54 → 7489.46] it'll last,
[7489.56 → 7490.08] I don't know,
[7490.16 → 7490.80] anywhere from
[7490.80 → 7492.26] one to five episodes
[7492.26 → 7494.14] and usually I fall asleep
[7494.14 → 7494.60] in that time
[7494.60 → 7496.12] so it doesn't really matter
[7496.12 → 7497.50] but like why can't
[7497.50 → 7497.98] you do it?
[7498.70 → 7499.72] And if there's an error,
[7500.44 → 7501.30] I don't care.
[7501.84 → 7503.22] Don't tell me about it.
[7504.20 → 7505.40] Process it in the background
[7505.40 → 7506.76] with the buffer
[7506.76 → 7508.84] that you already have
[7508.84 → 7511.42] and start playing it again
[7511.42 → 7512.72] at the point of the buffer.
[7512.84 → 7513.96] Like why do I have to explain
[7513.96 → 7514.68] to you how to play
[7514.68 → 7516.14] a freaking video?
[7517.04 → 7517.82] What is happening?
[7518.32 → 7520.40] A bunch of the Omega nerds
[7520.40 → 7521.40] in Full point chat
[7521.40 → 7522.42] are saying MB.
[7523.86 → 7524.26] Yeah.
[7526.26 → 7527.30] Don't know about that.
[7528.32 → 7529.30] Jellyfin seems to be
[7529.30 → 7530.04] the one that's getting
[7530.04 → 7530.76] the
[7531.20 → 7532.58] it seems to be the one
[7532.58 → 7533.60] that's like being
[7533.60 → 7534.70] pushed forward faster.
[7534.70 → 7536.14] I know MB was the play
[7536.14 → 7537.38] for a long time
[7537.38 → 7540.06] but I'm,
[7540.12 → 7540.38] dude,
[7540.46 → 7541.06] I'm super,
[7541.06 → 7542.22] I'm super frustrated
[7542.22 → 7543.38] with Plex at this point.
[7543.46 → 7544.48] I just like can't,
[7544.48 → 7545.78] I can't anymore
[7545.78 → 7546.86] for forever.
[7547.74 → 7548.46] So yeah,
[7548.54 → 7548.92] maybe,
[7549.00 → 7549.72] maybe what I'll do
[7549.72 → 7550.58] is I'll,
[7550.82 → 7553.08] I'll do like MB
[7553.08 → 7554.14] versus Jellyfin.
[7554.36 → 7555.16] I'll figure it out.
[7555.22 → 7555.50] I just,
[7556.20 → 7557.94] it's so tedious
[7557.94 → 7558.82] moving over
[7558.82 → 7560.30] like a big media library.
[7560.78 → 7560.92] Yeah,
[7560.92 → 7561.56] we have to keep upgrading
[7561.56 → 7561.96] the house,
[7562.04 → 7562.20] man.
[7563.02 → 7563.50] Yeah.
[7565.06 → 7565.66] I just,
[7565.74 → 7566.58] I'm getting a headache
[7566.58 → 7568.14] just thinking about
[7568.14 → 7569.66] dealing with all the
[7569.66 → 7571.02] like file naming
[7571.02 → 7572.24] crap.
[7573.04 → 7574.36] Is there like
[7574.36 → 7575.38] a migration tool?
[7576.04 → 7576.74] I mean,
[7576.84 → 7578.16] probably,
[7578.38 → 7579.22] but part of the problem
[7579.22 → 7579.84] is that I,
[7579.94 → 7580.86] I have never
[7580.86 → 7582.26] done all my file naming
[7582.26 → 7583.48] properly in the first place.
[7583.60 → 7584.00] Oh,
[7584.08 → 7584.70] look at you.
[7584.70 → 7585.74] So I have like
[7585.74 → 7587.86] thousands of Linux ISOs
[7587.86 → 7588.52] that don't have
[7588.52 → 7589.14] proper naming
[7589.14 → 7590.56] and Plex mostly figures it out
[7590.56 → 7591.50] so it doesn't really matter
[7591.50 → 7593.40] except when it does
[7593.40 → 7594.24] and it's really annoying.
[7594.64 → 7595.78] So thinking about
[7595.78 → 7596.74] doing that for
[7596.74 → 7598.06] everything is just
[7598.06 → 7598.90] very overwhelming.
[7599.14 → 7599.90] I don't understand
[7599.90 → 7600.82] what Plex is doing.
[7601.22 → 7602.66] So you guys were there.
[7603.02 → 7604.68] We actually used
[7604.68 → 7605.64] for me
[7605.64 → 7606.92] for the first time
[7606.92 → 7608.54] Plex's like new business
[7608.54 → 7609.34] which is
[7609.34 → 7610.90] free ad supported
[7610.90 → 7611.46] television.
[7611.62 → 7612.38] Very confusing.
[7612.38 → 7613.92] We watched Dr. Strange love.
[7614.64 → 7615.22] It was
[7615.22 → 7616.56] okay,
[7616.68 → 7618.02] I do have a Plex Pass
[7618.02 → 7619.42] so maybe this impacts it
[7619.42 → 7620.50] but it was
[7620.50 → 7621.36] completely free.
[7622.10 → 7623.52] It had no ads.
[7624.38 → 7625.82] The quality was
[7625.82 → 7626.94] great.
[7627.30 → 7627.70] Like it,
[7627.70 → 7628.62] it streamed at,
[7628.68 → 7629.70] I forget how many megabits
[7629.70 → 7630.46] it was, but it was
[7630.46 → 7631.18] It was nice.
[7631.60 → 7632.04] Oh,
[7632.08 → 7633.02] it was like 50.
[7633.22 → 7633.52] Yeah.
[7633.68 → 7634.58] It was too high.
[7634.64 → 7635.06] It was great.
[7635.20 → 7635.70] It was amazing.
[7636.14 → 7637.52] And I'm kind of sitting here
[7637.52 → 7637.88] going
[7637.88 → 7639.30] okay,
[7639.68 → 7640.88] so step one
[7640.88 → 7642.24] completely
[7642.24 → 7643.00] f*** up
[7643.00 → 7643.98] the
[7644.34 → 7644.78] you know,
[7645.48 → 7646.04] traditional
[7646.04 → 7647.70] piracy use case.
[7648.50 → 7649.44] Step two
[7649.44 → 7651.38] question mark
[7651.38 → 7652.08] um
[7652.08 → 7652.94] build
[7652.94 → 7653.90] whatever the f***
[7653.90 → 7654.52] this is
[7654.52 → 7655.24] with like
[7655.24 → 7655.80] free
[7655.80 → 7657.54] TV streaming.
[7658.24 → 7658.58] Step three
[7658.58 → 7658.96] profit,
[7659.10 → 7659.42] like what
[7659.42 → 7660.50] are they making money?
[7660.58 → 7661.54] Does Plex make money?
[7662.06 → 7662.62] I have no idea.
[7662.96 → 7663.18] I've,
[7663.28 → 7664.56] it's been fascinating lately
[7664.56 → 7665.40] to find out
[7665.40 → 7666.60] how many companies
[7666.60 → 7667.96] don't
[7667.96 → 7670.06] and are just funded
[7670.06 → 7671.92] by constant rounds
[7671.92 → 7673.70] of VC and investors.
[7674.82 → 7676.34] It's actually like wild.
[7677.84 → 7678.90] Very interesting to me.
[7679.02 → 7680.18] It's such a weird space
[7680.18 → 7680.44] because
[7680.44 → 7682.44] we never took investment money.
[7683.12 → 7683.36] Yeah.
[7683.54 → 7685.46] But like it's a huge thing.
[7687.22 → 7687.74] Weird.
[7689.06 → 7689.54] Okay.
[7689.54 → 7689.82] Well,
[7689.86 → 7690.46] here's an article
[7690.46 → 7692.68] from January
[7692.68 → 7693.88] of last year.
[7694.54 → 7695.84] Streaming media company Plex
[7695.84 → 7697.12] raises $40 million
[7697.12 → 7698.60] as it
[7698.60 → 7699.58] nears
[7699.58 → 7701.34] profitability.
[7703.54 → 7704.66] The new round,
[7704.80 → 7705.78] which has not yet been disclosed,
[7705.86 → 7706.92] was initially said to be larger
[7706.92 → 7707.62] than Plex's
[7707.62 → 7708.88] $50 million growth round
[7708.88 → 7710.20] closed a few years ago.
[7710.38 → 7711.16] We now understand
[7711.16 → 7711.90] it's $40 million.
[7712.06 → 7712.74] A rep for Plex
[7712.74 → 7713.50] has confirmed
[7713.50 → 7715.22] the funds will help
[7715.22 → 7715.96] fuel the company's
[7715.96 → 7716.96] push toward profitability
[7716.96 → 7718.24] expected by year-end
[7718.24 → 7719.48] or just after.
[7722.56 → 7723.04] Okay.
[7723.28 → 7724.08] Thank you for,
[7724.26 → 7724.84] okay.
[7725.00 → 7725.96] Thank you for that.
[7726.68 → 7727.86] Plex's real world valuation
[7727.86 → 7728.40] is unknown
[7728.40 → 7728.90] as the company
[7728.90 → 7730.18] hasn't raised outside funds
[7730.18 → 7730.64] in some time
[7730.64 → 7731.24] preferring to work
[7731.24 → 7732.08] with its existing
[7732.08 → 7732.88] set of investors.
[7733.82 → 7734.34] Now,
[7734.60 → 7735.60] I might be
[7735.60 → 7737.10] misunderstanding
[7737.10 → 7739.04] investment.
[7741.30 → 7742.58] So is investment
[7742.58 → 7745.68] a hole in the ground
[7745.68 → 7746.88] where you keep
[7746.88 → 7747.44] putting money?
[7748.62 → 7749.82] Is that investment?
[7750.00 → 7750.42] This is,
[7750.54 → 7751.58] this is where I find
[7751.58 → 7752.34] things to be kind of
[7752.34 → 7752.72] confusing
[7752.72 → 7753.88] because it seems like,
[7754.84 → 7756.24] like there's some
[7756.24 → 7756.80] companies
[7756.80 → 7758.34] that I have been,
[7758.66 → 7759.56] Traff2K says,
[7759.68 → 7761.06] I love edging profits.
[7763.72 → 7764.58] That's pretty funny.
[7765.08 → 7766.06] There are some companies
[7766.06 → 7767.08] that I've been exposed
[7767.08 → 7768.14] to information recently
[7768.14 → 7769.18] where they like
[7769.18 → 7773.14] have like never made money,
[7773.22 → 7773.76] have been around
[7773.76 → 7775.34] for a very long time.
[7776.74 → 7778.30] And who knows
[7778.30 → 7779.30] if they're ever going to
[7779.30 → 7780.00] and if they're going to,
[7780.06 → 7780.58] it's not gonna,
[7780.86 → 7782.12] there's no like plan
[7782.12 → 7782.70] for them to like
[7782.70 → 7783.50] make a bunch,
[7784.24 → 7784.56] you know?
[7785.18 → 7785.92] It's weird.
[7786.76 → 7787.08] This is,
[7787.08 → 7787.70] and there's obviously,
[7787.82 → 7788.68] there's always the sell
[7788.68 → 7789.62] the company kind of
[7789.62 → 7790.36] grift thing.
[7790.56 → 7791.86] You try to get big enough.
[7792.00 → 7792.46] It's like,
[7792.48 → 7793.22] it's like the whole like
[7793.22 → 7794.80] don't make revenue idea
[7794.80 → 7795.96] because you try to get
[7795.96 → 7796.40] big enough
[7796.40 → 7797.28] and look scary enough
[7797.28 → 7798.06] but don't actually
[7798.06 → 7798.94] really actualize
[7798.94 → 7799.74] so that you can sell
[7799.74 → 7800.40] to someone big
[7800.40 → 7801.02] so they can like
[7801.02 → 7802.02] shut you down basically.
[7802.02 → 7802.92] Because they see you
[7802.92 → 7803.90] as a potential threat
[7803.90 → 7804.72] or you can,
[7804.76 → 7805.08] but they don't know
[7805.08 → 7805.78] how much of a threat
[7805.78 → 7806.46] so they just want
[7806.46 → 7807.10] to buy you to get rid of it.
[7807.12 → 7807.80] Or you can sell
[7807.80 → 7808.64] to like a
[7808.64 → 7808.90] you know,
[7808.94 → 7810.00] a drug addled billionaire
[7810.00 → 7810.56] or something.
[7810.70 → 7810.82] Sure.
[7811.20 → 7811.34] Yeah.
[7812.06 → 7812.70] There's always that.
[7812.92 → 7813.26] See this,
[7813.34 → 7813.50] this,
[7813.62 → 7814.18] this right here,
[7814.24 → 7814.72] like they're saying
[7814.72 → 7815.78] the quiet part out loud.
[7816.20 → 7817.10] We have the most
[7817.10 → 7818.12] supportive investors
[7818.12 → 7818.64] of any,
[7819.02 → 7819.58] Valerie said.
[7819.86 → 7820.84] I feel like funding
[7820.84 → 7821.38] has never been
[7821.38 → 7822.24] a concern of ours.
[7823.24 → 7823.86] I mean,
[7824.58 → 7825.78] maybe your customers
[7825.78 → 7827.28] would be less pissed off
[7827.28 → 7827.70] at you
[7827.70 → 7828.98] if you felt like
[7828.98 → 7830.02] funding was a concern
[7830.02 → 7830.84] and you needed them
[7830.84 → 7831.52] to like you.
[7831.52 → 7831.92] Yeah.
[7832.28 → 7832.50] Like,
[7832.72 → 7833.14] you know,
[7833.24 → 7833.80] like I feel,
[7834.22 → 7835.40] I feel like not being
[7835.40 → 7836.18] concerned about
[7836.18 → 7837.00] where your next meal
[7837.00 → 7837.86] is going to come from
[7837.86 → 7839.16] might breed a little bit
[7839.16 → 7839.82] of urgency
[7839.82 → 7840.58] when it comes to
[7840.58 → 7841.56] dealing with longstanding
[7841.56 → 7842.60] issues on the platform.
[7843.80 → 7844.58] Just saying,
[7844.70 → 7844.82] just,
[7844.92 → 7845.28] I don't know,
[7845.32 → 7845.88] maybe it was crazy.
[7846.10 → 7846.78] Probably crazy.
[7846.78 → 7851.98] All right.
[7852.50 → 7852.80] Well,
[7852.98 → 7853.42] yeah,
[7853.48 → 7854.20] good luck with that.
[7855.34 → 7856.10] What else we got?
[7858.38 → 7859.20] Let's see.
[7859.56 → 7859.70] Oh,
[7859.74 → 7859.82] wait,
[7859.86 → 7860.26] we weren't done
[7860.26 → 7861.16] talking about the Pixel.
[7861.68 → 7862.04] Yeah.
[7862.30 → 7863.38] The Pixel event.
[7864.00 → 7864.34] All right,
[7864.38 → 7865.32] the Pixel Watch 4
[7865.32 → 7866.24] gets a brighter screen.
[7866.24 → 7868.56] 3,000 nits.
[7868.86 → 7869.98] 16% smaller bezels
[7869.98 → 7871.20] and has a domed display
[7871.20 → 7872.22] that gives about 10%
[7872.22 → 7873.18] more visible screen space.
[7873.36 → 7873.58] Neat.
[7874.06 → 7875.26] Starts at 350 bucks
[7875.26 → 7876.86] and claims 30 hours
[7876.86 → 7877.58] of battery life.
[7878.04 → 7878.84] The Buds 2A
[7878.84 → 7879.90] cost 130 bucks
[7879.90 → 7880.56] and include the
[7880.56 → 7881.96] Tensor A1 chip
[7881.96 → 7882.60] this time around.
[7882.92 → 7883.58] Also comes with
[7883.58 → 7884.16] ANC,
[7884.28 → 7885.14] active noise-cancelling,
[7885.30 → 7886.04] and a slightly
[7886.04 → 7887.32] better charging case.
[7887.32 → 7887.98] Finally,
[7888.12 → 7888.58] there's the
[7888.58 → 7890.18] Pixel Flex Dual
[7890.18 → 7893.26] 67 watt charger.
[7893.70 → 7894.76] The device can charge
[7894.76 → 7895.60] up to two devices
[7895.60 → 7897.14] at a max of 60 watts each
[7897.14 → 7898.48] and will detect
[7898.48 → 7899.78] when a Pixel device
[7899.78 → 7900.44] is plugged in
[7900.44 → 7901.78] and prioritize
[7901.78 → 7902.72] that device
[7902.72 → 7903.56] to charge it
[7903.56 → 7904.42] quote,
[7904.86 → 7905.48] first
[7905.48 → 7906.30] and
[7906.30 → 7907.28] faster.
[7908.76 → 7909.44] Okay.
[7911.56 → 7912.24] Neat.
[7912.90 → 7913.86] But also,
[7914.98 → 7916.10] oh my god,
[7916.10 → 7916.54] no.
[7917.32 → 7919.06] So two things here.
[7919.46 → 7920.06] Number one,
[7920.66 → 7921.34] we need to stop
[7921.34 → 7922.12] f***ING with
[7922.12 → 7923.48] the USB-C standard.
[7923.80 → 7924.66] It's barely
[7924.66 → 7925.70] a standard already
[7925.70 → 7928.00] and the last thing,
[7928.50 → 7929.42] the absolute
[7929.42 → 7930.66] last thing
[7930.66 → 7931.52] on earth
[7931.52 → 7932.70] that I or anyone
[7932.70 → 7933.22] needs
[7933.22 → 7934.72] is more USB-C
[7934.72 → 7935.14] devices
[7935.14 → 7936.62] that have
[7936.62 → 7937.38] proprietary
[7937.38 → 7938.56] handshakes
[7938.56 → 7939.36] and bullshit.
[7941.22 → 7942.06] Stop.
[7942.48 → 7943.42] Entire industry
[7943.42 → 7944.02] right now,
[7944.32 → 7944.98] it's time
[7944.98 → 7945.78] to stop.
[7945.78 → 7946.48] I also think
[7946.48 → 7947.18] like no one
[7947.18 → 7947.78] asked for this.
[7947.84 → 7948.52] Number two,
[7948.72 → 7951.68] have a priority
[7951.68 → 7952.44] port.
[7952.96 → 7954.14] Give me control
[7954.14 → 7954.72] over it.
[7954.98 → 7955.60] Maybe I want to
[7955.60 → 7956.24] charge my phone
[7956.24 → 7956.86] and my laptop,
[7957.26 → 7958.32] but I actually
[7958.32 → 7959.78] don't prefer to
[7959.78 → 7960.52] charge my phone
[7960.52 → 7961.42] right now faster.
[7961.56 → 7962.32] I want to charge
[7962.32 → 7963.58] my laptop faster.
[7963.82 → 7965.06] Did you ever
[7965.06 → 7966.02] think of that?
[7966.02 → 7969.20] am I missing
[7969.20 → 7970.12] something here?
[7971.98 → 7973.00] You should just
[7973.00 → 7974.22] have a priority
[7974.22 → 7974.64] port,
[7974.70 → 7975.08] it should be
[7975.08 → 7975.56] labelled and
[7975.56 → 7976.04] then I can
[7976.04 → 7976.52] pick.
[7981.90 → 7982.34] Yep.
[7982.34 → 7985.56] Oh my god.
[7987.44 → 7988.12] Discussion question,
[7988.24 → 7988.50] Linus,
[7988.54 → 7989.12] you had debated
[7989.12 → 7989.94] switching to the
[7989.94 → 7990.96] Samsung Fold 7
[7990.96 → 7991.52] soon.
[7991.80 → 7992.30] Do you think
[7992.30 → 7993.24] this Pixel Fold
[7993.24 → 7994.52] is a compelling
[7994.52 → 7995.64] option considering
[7995.64 → 7996.78] it is 200 US
[7996.78 → 7997.78] dollars cheaper
[7997.78 → 7998.82] than the Samsung
[7998.82 → 7999.84] or will you still
[7999.84 → 8000.32] be going with
[8000.32 → 8000.66] the Samsung?
[8002.82 → 8003.72] I will,
[8005.06 → 8005.78] I,
[8005.78 → 8008.12] I kind of
[8008.12 → 8008.78] miss my,
[8008.90 → 8009.70] my One UI.
[8010.18 → 8010.74] I kind of want
[8010.74 → 8011.30] to go Samsung
[8011.30 → 8013.82] first, and it's,
[8014.02 → 8014.54] that's going to,
[8014.64 → 8015.10] oh man,
[8015.18 → 8015.74] see I kind of
[8015.74 → 8016.24] feel like I've
[8016.24 → 8016.84] got my order of
[8016.84 → 8017.58] operations wrong
[8017.58 → 8018.80] here because I
[8018.80 → 8019.50] still haven't quite
[8019.50 → 8020.08] finished my
[8020.08 → 8020.66] Graphene OS
[8020.66 → 8021.02] switch.
[8021.22 → 8022.18] I did figure out
[8022.18 → 8022.56] some of the
[8022.56 → 8023.24] challenges I was
[8023.24 → 8023.56] having,
[8023.78 → 8024.66] I'm in touch
[8024.66 → 8025.22] with someone from
[8025.22 → 8025.82] there and I
[8025.82 → 8026.54] think I'm
[8026.54 → 8027.80] basically ready to
[8027.80 → 8028.34] like switch over
[8028.34 → 8028.60] to it.
[8028.62 → 8029.04] I just need to
[8029.04 → 8029.72] set aside like,
[8031.40 → 8032.74] it takes so long
[8032.74 → 8033.22] for me to switch
[8033.22 → 8033.86] devices, dude.
[8034.06 → 8034.68] And like,
[8034.74 → 8035.34] I don't want to
[8035.34 → 8035.86] blame you,
[8036.02 → 8036.56] but like,
[8037.26 → 8037.54] you know,
[8037.80 → 8038.30] you're part of
[8038.30 → 8038.82] the problem.
[8038.94 → 8039.26] Why?
[8039.62 → 8040.54] Because if I
[8040.54 → 8041.14] want to,
[8041.26 → 8041.42] okay,
[8041.48 → 8042.04] for instance,
[8042.12 → 8042.94] if I set aside
[8042.94 → 8043.34] a time for
[8043.34 → 8044.14] myself to switch
[8044.14 → 8044.70] all my stuff
[8044.70 → 8045.02] over,
[8045.54 → 8046.18] like say for
[8046.18 → 8046.68] instance,
[8047.06 → 8048.80] it's at 11
[8048.80 → 8049.18] PM.
[8049.90 → 8050.32] I'm like,
[8050.58 → 8051.82] I don't know
[8051.82 → 8052.36] how to migrate
[8052.36 → 8053.14] like my pass
[8053.14 → 8053.56] keys.
[8054.04 → 8054.46] I literally
[8054.46 → 8054.90] don't even know
[8054.90 → 8055.32] how that stuff
[8055.32 → 8056.02] works anymore.
[8056.28 → 8056.82] Just my work
[8056.82 → 8057.36] accounts just
[8057.36 → 8057.90] like prompted
[8057.90 → 8058.64] me one day
[8058.64 → 8060.90] and like,
[8061.18 → 8061.60] I,
[8061.72 → 8062.28] I literally
[8062.28 → 8062.86] can't sign
[8062.86 → 8063.32] into stuff
[8063.32 → 8063.92] without this
[8063.92 → 8064.26] phone,
[8064.44 → 8064.82] some of them.
[8064.82 → 8065.60] I need to
[8065.60 → 8066.02] sit down
[8066.02 → 8066.40] with someone
[8066.40 → 8066.86] from IT
[8066.86 → 8067.84] and figure
[8067.84 → 8068.22] out what
[8068.22 → 8068.70] the crap
[8068.70 → 8069.06] is going
[8069.06 → 8069.40] on with
[8069.40 → 8069.66] all of
[8069.66 → 8069.82] my
[8069.82 → 8070.22] authentication
[8070.22 → 8070.84] factors
[8070.84 → 8071.28] because
[8071.28 → 8072.08] I'm not
[8072.08 → 8072.40] going to lie
[8072.40 → 8072.72] to you.
[8073.04 → 8073.66] It's one of
[8073.66 → 8074.08] those things
[8074.08 → 8074.80] that's so much
[8074.80 → 8075.98] easier to
[8075.98 → 8077.36] just dismiss
[8077.36 → 8078.22] every time I
[8078.22 → 8078.78] do it
[8078.78 → 8079.68] versus like
[8079.68 → 8080.04] fix.
[8080.22 → 8081.24] I still have
[8081.24 → 8081.86] accounts that
[8081.86 → 8082.48] prompt me for
[8082.48 → 8083.22] a YubiKey.
[8083.22 → 8086.10] Okay,
[8086.14 → 8086.56] you have to
[8086.56 → 8087.10] own some
[8087.10 → 8087.60] of this.
[8087.76 → 8088.00] I do.
[8088.24 → 8088.64] Okay.
[8089.00 → 8089.34] But I'm
[8089.34 → 8089.50] going to
[8089.50 → 8089.86] blame you
[8089.86 → 8090.22] for another
[8090.22 → 8090.48] thing.
[8090.50 → 8090.58] I'm okay
[8090.58 → 8091.34] with at
[8091.34 → 8092.00] least some
[8092.00 → 8092.36] amount of
[8092.36 → 8092.58] that,
[8092.90 → 8093.44] but holy
[8093.44 → 8094.04] crap,
[8094.16 → 8094.40] dude.
[8095.76 → 8096.28] My
[8096.28 → 8096.64] God.
[8096.68 → 8097.00] Unique
[8097.00 → 8097.52] username
[8097.52 → 8097.86] says
[8097.86 → 8098.42] passkeys
[8098.42 → 8099.88] are not
[8099.88 → 8100.14] what we
[8100.14 → 8100.60] were promised.
[8100.82 → 8101.34] Oh my
[8101.34 → 8101.92] God,
[8102.04 → 8102.58] right?
[8102.82 → 8103.32] So I
[8103.32 → 8103.58] get a
[8103.58 → 8104.00] notification
[8104.00 → 8104.54] on my
[8104.54 → 8104.84] phone.
[8105.00 → 8105.28] I
[8105.28 → 8105.74] unlock
[8105.74 → 8105.98] my
[8105.98 → 8106.30] phone.
[8106.30 → 8106.68] I
[8106.68 → 8107.00] have to
[8107.00 → 8107.26] click
[8107.26 → 8107.42] a
[8107.42 → 8107.70] thing.
[8107.70 → 8108.22] I get
[8108.22 → 8108.62] prompted
[8108.62 → 8109.34] for a
[8109.34 → 8110.52] fingerprint
[8110.52 → 8111.66] again.
[8112.22 → 8113.34] I wait.
[8113.74 → 8114.30] It's like
[8114.30 → 8115.84] seven to
[8115.84 → 8116.02] eight
[8116.02 → 8116.60] interactions.
[8116.76 → 8117.06] I could
[8117.06 → 8117.46] have typed
[8117.46 → 8118.22] a password.
[8119.20 → 8119.70] Oh my
[8119.70 → 8120.28] God.
[8121.66 → 8122.06] Anyway,
[8122.30 → 8122.68] the other
[8122.68 → 8123.66] one is
[8123.66 → 8124.22] I can't
[8124.22 → 8124.54] get into
[8124.54 → 8125.22] my badminton
[8125.22 → 8125.68] club
[8125.68 → 8127.82] without
[8127.82 → 8128.64] requesting
[8128.64 → 8129.72] a new
[8129.72 → 8130.56] invitation
[8130.56 → 8132.06] to my
[8132.06 → 8132.80] identity
[8132.80 → 8133.44] system.
[8134.62 → 8135.76] And I
[8135.76 → 8136.06] know
[8136.06 → 8136.56] we're
[8136.56 → 8137.10] working with
[8137.10 → 8137.56] Unify
[8137.56 → 8137.98] we're
[8137.98 → 8138.22] working
[8138.22 → 8138.54] with
[8138.54 → 8138.98] Ubiquity
[8138.98 → 8139.52] on that.
[8139.62 → 8140.18] But like
[8140.18 → 8140.34] I
[8140.34 → 8140.96] literally
[8140.96 → 8141.78] can't
[8141.78 → 8142.18] even
[8142.18 → 8142.56] sign
[8142.56 → 8142.80] into
[8142.80 → 8143.02] all
[8143.02 → 8143.22] my
[8143.22 → 8143.50] stuff
[8143.50 → 8143.66] on
[8143.66 → 8143.84] my
[8143.84 → 8144.10] own.
[8145.24 → 8145.68] I
[8145.68 → 8146.04] hate
[8146.04 → 8146.28] it
[8146.28 → 8147.02] so
[8147.02 → 8147.52] much.
[8147.66 → 8147.84] One
[8147.84 → 8147.94] of
[8147.94 → 8148.12] those
[8148.12 → 8148.26] is
[8148.26 → 8148.44] to
[8148.44 → 8148.80] save
[8148.80 → 8149.82] incredible
[8149.82 → 8150.16] amounts
[8150.16 → 8150.30] of
[8150.30 → 8150.42] money.
[8150.42 → 8150.62] I
[8150.62 → 8151.08] know.
[8151.36 → 8151.58] I
[8151.58 → 8152.10] know.
[8152.28 → 8152.48] So
[8152.48 → 8153.12] to bother
[8153.12 → 8153.38] you
[8153.38 → 8153.86] to sign
[8153.86 → 8154.18] in
[8154.18 → 8155.16] one
[8155.16 → 8155.76] time
[8155.76 → 8156.56] in an
[8156.56 → 8156.82] annoying
[8156.82 → 8157.08] way
[8157.08 → 8157.42] whenever
[8157.42 → 8157.68] you
[8157.68 → 8157.86] switch
[8157.86 → 8158.06] a
[8158.06 → 8158.24] phone.
[8158.24 → 8158.26] Every
[8158.26 → 8158.58] time I
[8158.58 → 8158.78] switch
[8158.78 → 8158.96] a
[8158.96 → 8159.24] phone
[8159.24 → 8160.10] sucks.
[8160.28 → 8160.58] One
[8160.58 → 8160.88] annoying
[8160.88 → 8161.14] time
[8161.14 → 8161.30] every
[8161.30 → 8161.42] time
[8161.42 → 8161.52] you
[8161.52 → 8161.66] switch
[8161.66 → 8161.76] a
[8161.76 → 8161.86] phone
[8161.86 → 8162.26] which
[8167.56 → 8168.30] we
[8168.30 → 8168.44] are
[8168.44 → 8168.80] saving
[8168.80 → 8169.66] so
[8169.66 → 8170.06] much
[8170.06 → 8170.44] money.
[8172.14 → 8172.62] I
[8172.62 → 8172.96] know.
[8173.14 → 8173.32] For
[8173.32 → 8173.66] one
[8173.66 → 8174.14] small
[8174.14 → 8174.82] extremely
[8174.82 → 8175.24] easily
[8175.24 → 8175.66] solvable
[8175.66 → 8176.06] not
[8176.06 → 8176.26] even
[8176.26 → 8176.52] doesn't
[8176.52 → 8176.62] even
[8176.62 → 8176.78] have
[8176.78 → 8176.86] to
[8176.86 → 8177.00] be
[8177.00 → 8177.20] by
[8177.20 → 8177.46] you
[8177.46 → 8177.76] step.
[8178.34 → 8178.80] I
[8178.80 → 8178.98] just
[8178.98 → 8179.16] hate
[8179.16 → 8179.32] the
[8179.32 → 8179.54] way
[8179.54 → 8180.06] Ubiquity
[8180.06 → 8180.46] handles
[8180.46 → 8180.78] that.
[8180.94 → 8181.00] So
[8181.00 → 8181.18] the
[8181.18 → 8181.68] enterprise
[8181.68 → 8182.18] versus
[8182.18 → 8182.44] the
[8182.44 → 8182.80] regular
[8182.80 → 8183.30] identity
[8183.30 → 8183.78] app
[8183.78 → 8183.94] and
[8183.94 → 8184.24] something
[8184.24 → 8184.72] something
[8184.72 → 8185.04] fee
[8185.04 → 8185.24] per
[8185.24 → 8185.72] user.
[8185.90 → 8186.14] Smash
[8186.14 → 8186.44] champs
[8186.44 → 8186.56] has
[8186.56 → 8186.94] lots
[8186.94 → 8187.04] and
[8187.04 → 8187.16] lots
[8187.16 → 8187.52] and
[8187.52 → 8187.64] lots
[8187.64 → 8187.74] of
[8187.74 → 8188.18] users
[8188.18 → 8188.50] because
[8188.50 → 8189.24] all
[8189.24 → 8189.36] of
[8189.36 → 8189.52] its
[8189.52 → 8189.92] members
[8189.92 → 8190.26] have
[8190.26 → 8190.46] their
[8190.46 → 8190.74] key
[8190.74 → 8191.20] fobs
[8191.20 → 8191.84] and
[8191.84 → 8191.98] so
[8191.98 → 8192.10] we
[8192.10 → 8192.20] have
[8192.20 → 8192.28] to
[8192.28 → 8192.40] use
[8192.40 → 8192.56] the
[8192.56 → 8192.74] not
[8192.74 → 8193.18] enterprise
[8193.18 → 8193.38] one
[8193.38 → 8193.56] and
[8193.56 → 8194.08] literally
[8194.08 → 8194.40] the
[8194.40 → 8194.78] only
[8194.78 → 8195.06] way
[8195.06 → 8195.26] to
[8195.26 → 8195.50] sign
[8195.50 → 8195.72] into
[8195.72 → 8195.88] the
[8195.88 → 8196.06] not
[8196.06 → 8196.38] enterprise
[8196.38 → 8196.66] one
[8196.66 → 8196.78] is
[8196.78 → 8196.90] to
[8196.90 → 8197.02] get
[8197.02 → 8197.26] an
[8197.26 → 8197.84] invitation
[8197.84 → 8198.14] from
[8198.14 → 8198.30] your
[8198.30 → 8198.54] IT
[8198.54 → 8198.94] department
[8198.94 → 8199.14] you
[8199.14 → 8199.82] cannot
[8199.82 → 8201.50] initiate
[8201.50 → 8201.74] it
[8201.74 → 8202.16] yourself
[8202.16 → 8203.28] wait
[8203.28 → 8204.26] unless
[8204.26 → 8204.88] you
[8204.88 → 8205.52] give me
[8205.52 → 8205.66] the
[8205.66 → 8205.96] ability
[8205.96 → 8206.18] to
[8206.18 → 8206.54] initiate
[8206.54 → 8206.68] it
[8206.68 → 8206.80] to
[8206.80 → 8207.12] myself
[8207.12 → 8207.98] why
[8207.98 → 8209.58] why
[8209.58 → 8210.62] do
[8210.62 → 8210.72] you
[8210.72 → 8211.00] think
[8211.00 → 8212.44] because
[8212.44 → 8212.68] you're
[8212.68 → 8212.90] afraid
[8212.90 → 8213.02] I'll
[8213.02 → 8213.18] be
[8213.18 → 8213.56] too
[8213.56 → 8214.12] efficient
[8214.12 → 8215.48] at
[8215.48 → 8216.20] administrating
[8216.20 → 8216.48] it
[8216.48 → 8217.10] and
[8217.10 → 8217.20] I'll
[8217.20 → 8217.38] make
[8217.38 → 8217.50] you
[8217.50 → 8217.70] look
[8217.70 → 8218.02] bad
[8218.02 → 8219.20] I
[8219.20 → 8219.60] am
[8219.60 → 8219.78] a
[8219.78 → 8219.96] little
[8219.96 → 8220.24] bit
[8220.24 → 8220.72] afraid
[8220.72 → 8221.16] of
[8221.16 → 8221.36] your
[8221.36 → 8221.68] level
[8221.68 → 8221.86] of
[8221.86 → 8222.34] efficiency
[8222.34 → 8224.44] when
[8224.44 → 8224.88] say
[8224.88 → 8225.00] a
[8225.00 → 8225.34] notification
[8225.34 → 8225.72] comes
[8225.72 → 8227.24] in
[8227.24 → 8230.62] just
[8230.62 → 8231.04] solving

[8240.50 → 8240.92] a name
[8240.92 → 8241.20] in my
[8241.20 → 8241.80] notifications
[8241.80 → 8242.82] every time
[8242.82 → 8243.12] I see

[8244.34 → 8244.66] in a

[8259.20 → 8259.52] do it
[8259.52 → 8259.84] it must
[8259.84 → 8260.08] have been
[8260.08 → 8260.54] ran over
[8260.54 → 8261.10] by the
[8261.10 → 8261.58] must be
[8261.58 → 8262.16] your acid
[8262.16 → 8262.62] freaking
[8262.62 → 8263.38] skin or
[8263.38 → 8263.64] something
[8263.64 → 8263.98] what
[8263.98 → 8264.40] no
[8264.40 → 8264.64] yeah
[8264.64 → 8264.92] you'd
[8264.92 → 8265.04] like
[8265.04 → 8265.42] destroy
[8265.42 → 8265.80] everything
[8265.80 → 8266.26] you touch
[8266.26 → 8266.68] that is
[8266.68 → 8267.16] true
[8267.16 → 8269.42] ironically
[8269.42 → 8270.36] true
[8270.36 → 8271.90] your
[8271.90 → 8272.24] headphone
[8272.24 → 8272.54] cord
[8272.54 → 8273.18] yeah
[8273.18 → 8273.68] yeah
[8273.68 → 8274.38] okay I'll
[8274.38 → 8274.78] replace that
[8274.78 → 8274.92] I don't
[8274.92 → 8275.00] know if
[8275.00 → 8275.18] you can
[8275.18 → 8275.62] see that
[8275.62 → 8276.10] from here
[8276.10 → 8276.58] don't
[8276.58 → 8276.90] you worry
[8276.90 → 8277.56] I don't
[8277.56 → 8277.78] think
[8277.78 → 8278.34] that's a
[8278.34 → 8278.98] Dan task
[8278.98 → 8279.76] I think
[8279.76 → 8280.30] it's
[8280.30 → 8280.48] I don't
[8280.48 → 8280.64] want to
[8280.64 → 8280.94] be that
[8280.94 → 8281.32] guy but
[8281.32 → 8281.60] I really
[8281.60 → 8281.80] don't
[8281.80 → 8281.98] think
[8281.98 → 8282.42] replacing
[8282.42 → 8282.88] a cord
[8282.88 → 8283.16] is a
[8283.16 → 8283.40] Dan
[8283.40 → 8283.76] task
[8283.76 → 8283.92] might
[8283.92 → 8284.18] just be
[8284.18 → 8284.44] a no
[8284.44 → 8284.62] one
[8284.62 → 8285.04] task
[8285.04 → 8285.48] oh I
[8285.48 → 8285.82] mean like
[8285.82 → 8286.16] I've got
[8286.16 → 8287.56] one on the
[8287.56 → 8287.82] shelf
[8287.82 → 8288.16] they can
[8288.16 → 8288.60] just like
[8288.60 → 8289.42] these
[8289.42 → 8289.60] are
[8289.60 → 8290.38] replaceable
[8290.38 → 8291.02] but I
[8291.02 → 8291.42] think that
[8291.42 → 8291.76] we should
[8291.76 → 8292.08] just
[8292.08 → 8293.00] throw out
[8293.00 → 8293.46] the headphones
[8293.46 → 8294.52] let's just
[8294.52 → 8294.88] throw out
[8294.88 → 8295.18] the headphones
[8295.18 → 8295.80] we're not
[8295.80 → 8296.08] going to
[8296.08 → 8296.30] throw out
[8296.30 → 8296.70] the headphones
[8296.70 → 8297.64] but we
[8297.64 → 8298.34] need better
[8298.34 → 8298.78] headphones
[8298.78 → 8299.34] don't we
[8299.34 → 8300.40] I'm gesturing
[8300.40 → 8301.04] vaguely at
[8301.04 → 8301.36] the man
[8301.36 → 8301.92] sitting next to
[8301.92 → 8302.10] me
[8302.10 → 8303.12] need is such
[8303.12 → 8303.72] a strong
[8303.72 → 8303.88] word
[8303.88 → 8304.30] that could be
[8304.30 → 8304.76] a video
[8304.76 → 8305.12] maybe
[8305.12 → 8305.52] like we
[8305.52 → 8305.94] wear them
[8305.94 → 8306.50] for four
[8306.50 → 8307.10] hours a
[8307.10 → 8307.60] week
[8307.60 → 8308.72] and you
[8308.72 → 8309.48] complain the
[8309.48 → 8310.40] entire time

[8316.24 → 8316.64] not about
[8316.64 → 8317.10] these
[8317.10 → 8318.56] it's 208
[8318.56 → 8319.36] hours a year
[8319.36 → 8319.74] you just
[8319.74 → 8320.24] complain about

[8330.78 → 8331.28] not done
[8331.28 → 8331.82] the AI
[8331.82 → 8332.38] sharpening

[8337.82 → 8338.58] Rhett
[8338.58 → 8339.26] Shall
[8339.26 → 8339.94] posted a

[8340.76 → 8341.40] Thursday
[8341.40 → 8342.08] investigating
[8342.08 → 8343.06] what appeared
[8343.06 → 8343.50] to him
[8343.50 → 8344.14] to be
[8344.14 → 8344.66] AI
[8344.66 → 8345.60] enhancements
[8345.60 → 8346.20] being applied
[8346.20 → 8346.82] to YouTube
[8346.82 → 8347.36] shorts
[8347.36 → 8348.26] without the

[8348.72 → 8349.02] knowledge
[8349.02 → 8349.90] or consent
[8349.90 → 8350.98] after fellow
[8350.98 → 8351.90] music YouTuber
[8351.90 → 8352.80] Rick Beato
[8352.80 → 8353.36] contacted
[8353.36 → 8353.70] Shall
[8353.70 → 8354.76] with example
[8354.76 → 8355.72] posts from
[8355.72 → 8356.44] his Instagram
[8356.44 → 8357.80] and YouTube
[8357.80 → 8358.68] accounts
[8358.68 → 8360.06] and I
[8360.06 → 8360.68] gotta say
[8360.68 → 8361.52] the difference
[8361.52 → 8362.32] is
[8362.32 → 8363.54] it's pretty
[8363.54 → 8364.08] interesting
[8364.08 → 8365.14] we're not
[8365.14 → 8365.50] going to play
[8365.50 → 8365.78] his whole
[8365.78 → 8366.06] video
[8366.06 → 8366.76] because that's
[8366.76 → 8367.18] not how
[8367.18 → 8367.66] we do
[8367.66 → 8368.22] our react
[8368.22 → 8368.74] content
[8368.74 → 8369.42] that is a
[8369.42 → 8369.94] lens
[8369.94 → 8370.58] that is a
[8370.58 → 8371.02] lens and a
[8371.02 → 8371.28] half
[8371.28 → 8371.72] that was
[8371.72 → 8372.32] chosen here
[8372.32 → 8372.66] don't worry
[8372.66 → 8372.92] about it
[8372.92 → 8373.20] but look
[8373.20 → 8373.60] at this
[8373.60 → 8374.54] you see
[8374.54 → 8375.28] that shift
[8375.28 → 8376.40] you see
[8376.40 → 8376.80] as he's
[8376.80 → 8377.14] shifting
[8377.14 → 8377.60] between
[8377.60 → 8378.00] YouTube
[8378.00 → 8378.50] shorts
[8378.50 → 8378.88] and
[8378.88 → 8379.38] Instagram
[8379.38 → 8380.42] how
[8380.42 → 8381.36] different
[8381.36 → 8382.48] the same
[8382.48 → 8382.98] piece of
[8382.98 → 8383.52] content
[8383.52 → 8383.94] looks
[8383.94 → 8384.20] and you
[8384.20 → 8384.68] can tell
[8384.68 → 8385.04] from the
[8385.04 → 8385.46] interface
[8385.46 → 8385.94] here
[8385.94 → 8386.58] yeah
[8386.58 → 8387.40] okay
[8387.40 → 8388.56] so this
[8388.56 → 8389.48] sparked a
[8389.48 → 8390.04] whole
[8390.04 → 8390.78] lot of
[8390.78 → 8391.44] conversation
[8391.44 → 8393.08] and Shall's
[8393.08 → 8393.76] video included
[8393.76 → 8394.36] some experiments
[8394.36 → 8395.22] of his own
[8395.22 → 8395.70] seeing the
[8395.70 → 8396.32] same effect
[8396.32 → 8398.28] on his own
[8398.28 → 8398.76] videos that
[8398.76 → 8399.22] was impacting
[8399.22 → 8399.60] Beta's
[8399.60 → 8399.90] videos
[8399.90 → 8401.46] he went on
[8401.46 → 8401.80] to find a
[8401.80 → 8402.20] Reddit thread
[8402.20 → 8403.10] discussing the
[8403.10 → 8403.62] same effect
[8403.62 → 8404.04] showing up
[8404.04 → 8404.40] on some of
[8404.40 → 8405.18] Hank Green's
[8405.18 → 8405.50] shorts
[8405.50 → 8407.12] then
[8407.12 → 8408.16] the plot
[8408.16 → 8408.66] thickens
[8408.66 → 8409.58] after we
[8409.58 → 8410.14] reported on
[8410.14 → 8410.58] the story
[8410.58 → 8411.34] on Monday's
[8411.34 → 8411.88] tech linked
[8411.88 → 8412.52] YouTube
[8412.52 → 8413.34] responded
[8413.34 → 8414.56] with an
[8414.56 → 8415.28] explanation
[8415.28 → 8416.54] okay
[8416.54 → 8416.92] technically
[8416.92 → 8417.22] YouTube
[8417.22 → 8417.68] responded
[8417.68 → 8417.98] to a
[8417.98 → 8418.16] guy
[8418.16 → 8418.34] who
[8418.34 → 8418.88] retweeted
[8418.88 → 8419.00] a
[8419.00 → 8419.54] reposted
[8419.54 → 8419.72] clip
[8419.72 → 8420.08] originally
[8420.08 → 8420.42] tweeted
[8420.42 → 8421.14] out by
[8421.14 → 8421.46] some
[8421.46 → 8421.82] other
[8421.82 → 8422.04] guy
[8422.04 → 8422.20] who
[8422.20 → 8422.40] clipped
[8422.40 → 8422.50] it
[8422.50 → 8422.62] from
[8422.62 → 8422.90] Monday's
[8422.90 → 8423.04] tech
[8423.04 → 8423.16] link
[8423.16 → 8423.40] video
[8423.40 → 8423.64] but
[8423.64 → 8423.88] you
[8423.88 → 8423.98] know
[8423.98 → 8424.24] what
[8424.24 → 8425.94] we're
[8425.94 → 8426.18] counting
[8426.18 → 8426.42] it
[8426.42 → 8426.68] that
[8426.68 → 8427.04] counts
[8427.04 → 8427.80] YouTube
[8427.80 → 8428.44] liaison
[8428.44 → 8428.74] Rene
[8428.74 → 8429.28] Ritchie
[8429.28 → 8429.56] said
[8429.56 → 8429.72] that
[8429.72 → 8429.86] this
[8429.86 → 8429.96] is
[8429.96 → 8430.08] an
[8430.08 → 8430.54] experiment
[8430.54 → 8430.90] that
[8430.90 → 8431.20] does
[8431.20 → 8431.96] not
[8431.96 → 8432.82] involve
[8432.82 → 8433.44] generative
[8433.44 → 8433.84] AI
[8433.84 → 8434.68] or
[8434.68 → 8435.24] upscaling
[8435.24 → 8436.72] what
[8436.72 → 8436.92] it
[8436.92 → 8437.08] is
[8437.08 → 8437.48] intended
[8437.48 → 8437.74] to
[8437.74 → 8437.98] do
[8437.98 → 8438.56] is
[8438.56 → 8439.34] blur
[8439.34 → 8440.60] Denise
[8440.60 → 8441.30] and
[8441.30 → 8441.76] improve
[8441.76 → 8442.30] clarity
[8442.30 → 8442.88] using
[8442.88 → 8444.08] traditional
[8444.08 → 8444.50] machine
[8444.50 → 8444.88] learning
[8444.88 → 8445.76] techniques
[8445.76 → 8449.94] what
[8449.94 → 8452.84] where's
[8452.84 → 8453.36] the line
[8453.36 → 8454.02] Ritchie
[8454.02 → 8454.76] also said
[8454.76 → 8455.38] the experiment
[8455.38 → 8455.98] was only
[8455.98 → 8456.40] running on
[8456.40 → 8456.80] a limited
[8456.80 → 8457.36] number of
[8457.36 → 8457.70] shorts
[8457.70 → 8458.62] but as far
[8458.62 → 8458.90] as we
[8458.90 → 8459.36] could tell
[8459.36 → 8460.04] it's
[8460.04 → 8460.40] pretty
[8460.40 → 8461.06] widespread
[8461.06 → 8462.40] responses
[8462.40 → 8462.84] on Twitter
[8462.84 → 8463.46] were almost
[8463.46 → 8464.32] universally
[8464.32 → 8464.84] opposed
[8464.84 → 8465.62] to using
[8465.62 → 8466.20] any
[8466.20 → 8466.62] sort
[8466.62 → 8467.06] of
[8467.06 → 8467.66] AI
[8467.66 → 8468.14] which
[8468.14 → 8468.44] that
[8468.44 → 8468.88] is
[8468.88 → 8469.48] well
[8469.48 → 8470.04] generally
[8470.04 → 8470.62] how people
[8470.62 → 8471.22] have considered
[8471.22 → 8471.56] it
[8471.56 → 8472.02] yes
[8472.02 → 8472.32] it
[8472.32 → 8472.82] okay
[8472.82 → 8473.20] it
[8473.20 → 8473.44] was
[8473.44 → 8473.98] called
[8473.98 → 8474.38] AI
[8474.38 → 8475.54] until
[8475.54 → 8476.00] we got
[8476.00 → 8476.26] new
[8476.26 → 8476.60] stuff
[8476.60 → 8476.88] that we
[8476.88 → 8477.16] called
[8477.16 → 8477.42] AI
[8477.42 → 8478.16] and this
[8478.16 → 8478.40] will
[8478.40 → 8478.72] happen
[8478.72 → 8479.08] again
[8479.08 → 8479.82] we will
[8479.82 → 8480.18] stop
[8480.18 → 8480.88] calling
[8480.88 → 8481.88] predictive
[8481.88 → 8482.54] LLMs
[8482.54 → 8482.92] AI
[8482.92 → 8483.58] because
[8483.58 → 8484.04] they're not
[8484.04 → 8484.60] once
[8484.60 → 8485.30] another
[8485.30 → 8485.68] layer
[8485.68 → 8486.34] comes out
[8486.34 → 8486.88] and then
[8486.88 → 8487.10] that's
[8487.10 → 8487.24] just
[8487.24 → 8487.46] going to
[8487.46 → 8487.64] keep
[8487.64 → 8488.00] going
[8488.00 → 8488.56] yes
[8488.56 → 8490.74] and I
[8490.74 → 8492.10] I remember
[8492.10 → 8492.82] like committing
[8492.82 → 8493.92] to not
[8493.92 → 8494.58] call what we
[8494.58 → 8495.24] have AI
[8495.24 → 8496.06] and call it
[8496.06 → 8496.60] machine learning
[8496.60 → 8496.98] forever
[8496.98 → 8497.76] but what I
[8497.76 → 8498.16] realized
[8498.16 → 8498.64] is that I
[8498.64 → 8498.94] couldn't
[8498.94 → 8499.26] continue
[8499.26 → 8499.70] doing that
[8499.70 → 8500.10] forever
[8500.10 → 8500.72] because it's
[8500.72 → 8501.20] confusing
[8501.20 → 8502.16] because people
[8502.16 → 8503.00] get confused
[8503.00 → 8503.72] who don't
[8503.72 → 8504.24] understand the
[8504.24 → 8504.68] distinction
[8504.68 → 8506.30] everything we
[8506.30 → 8506.92] have now
[8506.92 → 8507.82] is machine
[8507.82 → 8508.10] learning
[8508.10 → 8509.10] all of it
[8509.10 → 8509.78] none of it
[8509.78 → 8510.70] is AI
[8510.70 → 8512.06] we could call it
[8512.06 → 8512.80] generative machine
[8512.80 → 8513.22] learning or
[8513.22 → 8513.52] whatever
[8513.52 → 8514.62] but it is
[8514.62 → 8515.48] certainly not
[8515.48 → 8516.44] an intelligence
[8516.44 → 8517.70] of any
[8517.70 → 8518.10] sort
[8518.10 → 8519.04] and is
[8519.04 → 8520.32] but falls
[8520.32 → 8521.36] far short
[8521.36 → 8522.46] of what we
[8522.46 → 8523.04] think in
[8523.04 → 8524.36] science fiction
[8524.36 → 8524.92] terms
[8524.92 → 8525.70] of
[8525.70 → 8527.32] what AI
[8527.32 → 8527.96] is supposed
[8527.96 → 8528.34] to mean
[8528.34 → 8528.54] yeah
[8528.54 → 8529.02] the like
[8529.02 → 8529.96] 80s idea
[8529.96 → 8530.66] of AI
[8530.66 → 8531.26] yes
[8531.26 → 8531.70] we don't
[8531.70 → 8532.04] have it
[8532.04 → 8532.58] not a thing
[8532.58 → 8532.90] we're not
[8532.90 → 8533.24] close
[8533.24 → 8533.70] yeah
[8533.70 → 8535.06] others
[8535.06 → 8535.72] pointed out
[8535.72 → 8536.06] the trend
[8536.06 → 8536.52] of companies
[8536.52 → 8537.38] avoiding the
[8537.38 → 8537.62] term
[8537.62 → 8538.42] generative AI
[8538.42 → 8538.96] in favour
[8538.96 → 8539.30] of the
[8539.30 → 8539.50] less
[8539.50 → 8539.84] threatening
[8539.84 → 8540.30] sounding
[8540.30 → 8541.04] traditional
[8541.04 → 8541.42] machine
[8541.42 → 8541.78] learning
[8541.78 → 8542.12] yeah
[8542.12 → 8543.06] still others
[8543.06 → 8543.58] pointed out
[8543.58 → 8544.26] that when
[8544.26 → 8545.00] every video
[8545.00 → 8545.40] looks like
[8545.40 → 8545.68] it's been
[8545.68 → 8546.18] made with AI
[8546.18 → 8546.94] it's going
[8546.94 → 8547.54] to be a lot
[8547.54 → 8548.18] harder to
[8548.18 → 8548.74] identify the
[8548.74 → 8549.08] ones that
[8549.08 → 8550.00] actually are
[8550.00 → 8551.06] made with AI
[8551.06 → 8551.74] and it says
[8551.74 → 8552.66] Dan has a
[8552.66 → 8552.94] clip
[8552.94 → 8553.78] see it for
[8553.78 → 8554.16] yourself
[8554.16 → 8554.86] side-by-side
[8554.86 → 8555.32] comparison
[8555.32 → 8555.62] of the
[8555.62 → 8556.18] same clips
[8556.18 → 8556.56] downloaded
[8556.56 → 8557.18] from YouTube
[8557.18 → 8558.48] and Instagram
[8558.48 → 8558.92] all right
[8558.92 → 8559.78] hit it
[8559.78 → 8565.74] which one
[8565.74 → 8566.20] looks more
[8566.20 → 8566.50] sharp
[8566.50 → 8567.24] I mean the
[8567.24 → 8567.58] one on the
[8567.58 → 8567.76] left
[8567.76 → 8568.22] looks way
[8568.22 → 8568.60] sharper
[8568.60 → 8568.94] yeah
[8568.94 → 8569.80] yeah
[8569.80 → 8570.38] definitely
[8570.38 → 8570.82] left
[8570.82 → 8571.50] by a lot
[8571.50 → 8573.04] I like
[8573.04 → 8573.60] too much
[8573.60 → 8577.38] makes me
[8577.38 → 8577.70] think our
[8577.70 → 8578.14] cameras are
[8578.14 → 8578.68] really blurry
[8578.68 → 8582.64] oh this is
[8582.64 → 8583.14] an interesting
[8583.14 → 8583.68] one too
[8583.68 → 8584.14] you can see
[8584.14 → 8584.40] it in the
[8584.40 → 8584.68] artifacts
[8584.68 → 8585.46] yeah
[8585.46 → 8586.58] you could
[8586.58 → 8587.24] really see
[8587.24 → 8587.58] it when I
[8587.58 → 8588.02] spun in the
[8588.02 → 8588.32] chair
[8588.32 → 8588.86] look at the
[8588.86 → 8589.24] scrolling
[8589.24 → 8590.44] big artifacts
[8590.44 → 8593.08] they made your
[8593.08 → 8593.76] video worse
[8593.76 → 8599.74] this is one of
[8599.74 → 8600.22] those things
[8600.22 → 8600.94] where better
[8600.94 → 8602.08] is not always
[8602.08 → 8602.58] better
[8602.58 → 8603.06] well it's
[8603.06 → 8603.48] it's
[8603.48 → 8605.22] not better
[8605.22 → 8606.40] well it's
[8606.40 → 8607.96] it is more
[8607.96 → 8608.38] sharp
[8608.38 → 8609.70] and sharpness
[8609.70 → 8610.62] is generally
[8610.62 → 8611.48] considered to be
[8611.48 → 8612.34] brutal though
[8612.34 → 8613.52] sure but I
[8613.52 → 8614.30] just mean like
[8614.30 → 8614.82] like
[8614.82 → 8619.08] you could
[8619.08 → 8620.00] create a lot
[8620.00 → 8620.68] of metrics
[8620.68 → 8621.68] and you
[8621.68 → 8622.22] could use
[8622.22 → 8622.84] those metrics
[8622.84 → 8623.28] that you
[8623.28 → 8624.36] created to
[8624.36 → 8624.98] measure the
[8624.98 → 8625.44] one on the
[8625.44 → 8625.96] left as
[8625.96 → 8626.46] being better
[8626.46 → 8626.92] yeah
[8626.92 → 8628.48] but better
[8628.48 → 8629.86] is not always
[8629.86 → 8630.24] better
[8630.24 → 8631.16] we had this
[8631.16 → 8631.46] conversation
[8631.46 → 8631.92] the right side
[8631.92 → 8632.60] looks much
[8632.60 → 8633.26] more natural
[8633.26 → 8634.76] yeah
[8634.76 → 8636.88] yeah
[8636.88 → 8638.00] I didn't
[8638.00 → 8639.06] feel that
[8639.06 → 8639.98] mine looked
[8639.98 → 8640.66] as bad
[8640.66 → 8641.86] as some of
[8641.86 → 8642.34] the examples
[8642.34 → 8642.80] I saw
[8642.80 → 8643.04] though
[8643.04 → 8645.10] like
[8645.10 → 8645.68] I
[8645.68 → 8645.92] I
[8645.92 → 8646.32] didn't
[8646.32 → 8646.70] think those
[8646.70 → 8647.34] examples are
[8647.34 → 8647.82] particularly
[8647.82 → 8648.46] cherry-picked
[8648.46 → 8649.02] and this was
[8649.02 → 8649.58] just a random
[8649.58 → 8649.76] one
[8649.76 → 8650.24] no I don't
[8650.24 → 8650.54] I don't
[8650.54 → 8650.94] think that
[8650.94 → 8651.16] either
[8651.16 → 8651.58] I just
[8651.58 → 8652.26] think that
[8652.26 → 8653.46] maybe
[8653.46 → 8655.42] whether it's
[8655.42 → 8655.90] our camera
[8655.90 → 8656.72] we use
[8656.72 → 8657.26] or whether
[8657.26 → 8657.92] it's that
[8657.92 → 8658.50] particular
[8658.50 → 8659.04] video
[8659.04 → 8659.34] like there
[8659.34 → 8659.82] were certainly
[8659.82 → 8660.52] areas where
[8660.52 → 8660.80] it looked
[8660.80 → 8661.40] terrible
[8661.40 → 8662.22] but for the
[8662.22 → 8662.88] most part
[8662.88 → 8664.08] I didn't
[8664.08 → 8664.62] I felt it
[8664.62 → 8665.12] looked like
[8665.12 → 8665.70] over processed
[8665.70 → 8666.28] but I didn't
[8666.28 → 8666.62] feel it
[8666.62 → 8667.46] looked like
[8667.46 → 8667.82] AI
[8667.82 → 8669.44] Scrappy DP
[8669.44 → 8669.96] and Full plane
[8669.96 → 8670.36] Chats said
[8670.36 → 8671.04] Peter McKinnon
[8671.04 → 8671.76] made a video
[8671.76 → 8672.52] recently on
[8672.52 → 8673.26] not sharpening
[8673.26 → 8673.74] your content
[8673.74 → 8674.36] because YouTube
[8674.36 → 8674.84] is applying
[8674.84 → 8675.58] it so hard
[8675.58 → 8675.96] after the
[8675.96 → 8676.28] upload
[8676.28 → 8677.08] that actually
[8677.08 → 8678.76] makes a ton
[8678.76 → 8679.16] of sense
[8679.16 → 8681.42] our discussion
[8681.42 → 8682.14] question here
[8682.14 → 8682.70] is it
[8682.70 → 8683.50] okay to take
[8683.50 → 8683.84] a short
[8683.84 → 8684.42] creator's
[8684.42 → 8685.28] control away
[8685.28 → 8686.66] in terms of
[8686.66 → 8687.18] what their
[8687.18 → 8688.42] content looks
[8688.42 → 8688.94] like and
[8688.94 → 8689.38] what's to
[8689.38 → 8689.78] stop YouTube
[8689.78 → 8690.52] from going
[8690.52 → 8690.82] on and
[8690.82 → 8691.32] applying these
[8691.32 → 8691.84] enhancements
[8691.84 → 8692.68] to everything
[8692.68 → 8693.16] to long
[8693.16 → 8693.80] form videos
[8693.80 → 8694.52] TV shows
[8694.52 → 8695.18] films delivered
[8695.18 → 8695.48] by the
[8695.48 → 8695.90] platform
[8695.90 → 8696.72] where's the
[8696.72 → 8697.10] line and
[8697.10 → 8697.62] I would say
[8697.62 → 8698.50] the line
[8698.50 → 8699.36] is in the
[8699.36 → 8699.74] rearview
[8699.74 → 8701.48] mirror way
[8701.48 → 8702.78] back there
[8702.78 → 8704.18] the second
[8704.18 → 8705.16] YouTube does
[8705.16 → 8706.32] any processing
[8706.32 → 8707.12] to your video
[8707.12 → 8707.70] and they do
[8707.70 → 8708.22] it and they
[8708.22 → 8708.80] do it on
[8708.80 → 8710.76] every single
[8710.76 → 8711.96] video that is
[8711.96 → 8712.54] served by the
[8712.54 → 8713.64] platform they
[8713.64 → 8714.98] are impacting
[8714.98 → 8716.08] the look
[8716.08 → 8716.84] and that's not
[8716.84 → 8717.78] a battle that
[8717.78 → 8718.76] was never a war
[8718.76 → 8720.06] that's how it's
[8720.06 → 8720.44] going to go
[8720.44 → 8721.28] in fact
[8721.28 → 8722.74] Instagram is
[8722.74 → 8724.20] also applying
[8724.20 → 8724.86] processing
[8724.86 → 8726.78] and what
[8726.78 → 8727.36] we're watching
[8727.36 → 8727.82] on the
[8727.82 → 8728.26] Instagram
[8728.26 → 8729.10] side is
[8729.10 → 8729.82] their
[8729.82 → 8730.72] interpretation
[8730.72 → 8732.08] mostly
[8732.08 → 8732.80] probably
[8732.80 → 8733.36] optimized
[8733.36 → 8733.92] to save
[8733.92 → 8735.34] on bandwidth
[8735.34 → 8736.80] of what
[8736.80 → 8737.80] your original
[8737.80 → 8739.00] file was
[8739.00 → 8740.16] even your
[8740.16 → 8740.96] original file
[8740.96 → 8741.62] you upload
[8741.62 → 8743.18] is processed
[8743.18 → 8744.74] and is
[8744.74 → 8745.14] sort of
[8745.14 → 8746.12] approximated
[8746.12 → 8747.08] compared to
[8747.08 → 8747.52] what your
[8747.52 → 8748.44] sensor saw
[8748.44 → 8749.80] and even
[8749.80 → 8750.56] that is an
[8750.56 → 8751.04] approximation
[8751.04 → 8752.56] however
[8752.56 → 8753.48] I think
[8753.48 → 8753.86] that we
[8753.86 → 8754.36] can all
[8754.36 → 8754.76] agree
[8754.76 → 8755.34] that
[8755.34 → 8756.66] making
[8756.66 → 8757.38] things look
[8757.38 → 8758.22] more
[8758.22 → 8759.88] over processed
[8759.88 → 8760.72] and AI
[8760.72 → 8761.28] generated
[8761.28 → 8762.10] is not
[8762.10 → 8762.42] good
[8762.42 → 8762.92] and this
[8762.92 → 8763.40] seems to
[8763.40 → 8763.84] be
[8763.84 → 8766.26] over the
[8766.26 → 8766.56] line
[8766.56 → 8768.28] that
[8768.28 → 8768.72] seem
[8768.72 → 8769.20] yeah
[8769.20 → 8769.66] I like
[8769.66 → 8769.90] that
[8769.90 → 8770.96] okay
[8770.96 → 8771.84] neat
[8771.84 → 8772.30] good one
[8772.30 → 8775.70] I don't
[8775.70 → 8776.00] know
[8776.00 → 8776.52] why don't you
[8776.52 → 8777.04] pick something
[8777.04 → 8777.32] you want to
[8777.32 → 8777.80] pick something
[8777.80 → 8778.94] yeah it's
[8778.94 → 8779.72] pretty interesting
[8779.72 → 8780.30] cool
[8780.30 → 8781.22] Seagate tries
[8781.22 → 8781.70] an exciting
[8781.70 → 8782.28] new kind
[8782.28 → 8782.98] of raid
[8782.98 → 8783.92] earlier this
[8783.92 → 8786.80] he's doing
[8786.80 → 8787.00] good
[8787.00 → 8787.50] all right
[8787.50 → 8788.44] earlier this
[8788.44 → 8789.28] year Seagate
[8789.28 → 8790.04] security teams
[8790.04 → 8790.94] working alongside
[8790.94 → 8791.96] Malaysian authorities
[8791.96 → 8792.98] conducted a raid
[8792.98 → 8794.24] on a counterfeit
[8794.24 → 8794.86] hard drive
[8794.86 → 8795.42] operation
[8795.42 → 8796.28] these are
[8796.28 → 8796.90] man I would
[8796.90 → 8797.80] love to see
[8797.80 → 8798.32] one of these
[8798.32 → 8798.88] right
[8798.88 → 8799.56] that would be
[8799.56 → 8800.52] so interesting
[8800.52 → 8800.92] right
[8800.92 → 8801.96] how cool would that be
[8801.96 → 8802.40] how is it even
[8802.40 → 8802.74] possible
[8802.74 → 8803.10] that would be
[8803.10 → 8803.54] fascinating
[8803.54 → 8804.36] I always find
[8804.36 → 8804.94] remember the
[8804.94 → 8805.96] genuine Intel
[8805.96 → 8806.72] CPU thing
[8806.72 → 8807.64] like
[8807.64 → 8808.92] what
[8808.92 → 8811.16] I would love
[8811.16 → 8812.10] to see the place
[8812.10 → 8812.78] sorry Intel
[8812.78 → 8813.38] but I would love
[8813.38 → 8814.02] to see the place
[8814.02 → 8814.40] that makes
[8814.40 → 8815.56] non-genuine
[8815.56 → 8816.92] Intel CPUs
[8816.92 → 8818.42] you mean AMD
[8818.42 → 8820.32] anyway carry on
[8820.32 → 8821.60] fair enough
[8821.60 → 8822.84] got them
[8822.84 → 8823.92] those are some
[8823.92 → 8824.62] spicy
[8824.62 → 8825.80] how the turntables
[8825.80 → 8826.38] have turned
[8826.38 → 8827.90] old school war words
[8827.90 → 8828.24] yeah
[8828.24 → 8830.22] anyway the
[8830.22 → 8831.10] the raid
[8831.10 → 8831.88] uncovered nearly
[8831.88 → 8833.28] 700 Seagate
[8833.28 → 8834.16] drives in
[8834.16 → 8834.98] various models
[8834.98 → 8835.68] with capacities
[8835.68 → 8836.74] up to 18
[8836.74 → 8837.44] terabytes
[8837.44 → 8838.66] along with
[8838.66 → 8839.28] drives from
[8839.28 → 8840.38] other manufacturers
[8840.38 → 8841.46] the drives are
[8841.46 → 8841.94] believed to have
[8841.94 → 8842.80] come from China
[8842.80 → 8843.52] where they were
[8843.52 → 8844.48] used to store
[8844.48 → 8845.18] chia
[8845.18 → 8846.26] which does I think
[8846.26 → 8847.30] a storage currency
[8847.30 → 8847.66] yeah
[8847.66 → 8849.82] and sold off
[8849.82 → 8850.48] after that
[8850.48 → 8850.92] cryptocurrency
[8850.92 → 8852.22] became you know
[8852.22 → 8852.94] unprofitable
[8852.94 → 8854.38] used drives had
[8854.38 → 8855.48] their smart values
[8855.48 → 8856.00] reset
[8856.00 → 8856.60] oof
[8856.60 → 8858.00] data wiped
[8858.00 → 8858.94] and were cleaned
[8858.94 → 8859.76] relabelled
[8859.76 → 8860.70] and repackaged
[8860.70 → 8862.04] so okay
[8862.04 → 8862.62] I see
[8862.62 → 8863.48] sometimes as a
[8863.48 → 8864.10] more valuable
[8864.10 → 8864.80] model than they
[8864.80 → 8865.48] started out as
[8865.48 → 8866.38] and were then
[8866.38 → 8867.54] sold at discounted
[8867.54 → 8868.76] rates on local
[8868.76 → 8869.80] e-commerce platforms
[8869.80 → 8870.68] this was a whole
[8870.68 → 8871.98] thing and Seagate
[8871.98 → 8872.72] has probably
[8872.72 → 8873.56] invested
[8873.56 → 8875.54] significant resources
[8875.54 → 8876.48] chasing this
[8876.48 → 8877.20] bulls** down
[8877.20 → 8878.10] instead of like
[8878.10 → 8879.78] working on
[8879.78 → 8880.50] things that are
[8880.50 → 8881.12] valuable to their
[8881.12 → 8881.84] business I actually
[8881.84 → 8882.88] really feel for them
[8882.88 → 8883.56] in this situation
[8883.56 → 8884.62] this is like
[8884.62 → 8885.22] not on
[8885.22 → 8887.00] I mean
[8887.00 → 8888.08] maybe they could
[8888.08 → 8888.70] do more
[8888.70 → 8889.44] to prevent
[8889.44 → 8890.22] their smart values
[8890.22 → 8891.08] from being overwritten
[8891.08 → 8891.70] but like
[8891.70 → 8893.88] I don't know
[8893.88 → 8894.52] should they have
[8894.52 → 8895.06] seen this coming
[8895.06 → 8895.64] I don't know
[8895.64 → 8896.48] maybe this has
[8896.48 → 8897.04] happened before
[8897.04 → 8897.60] that I'm not
[8897.60 → 8898.24] aware of
[8898.24 → 8899.08] and they like
[8899.08 → 8899.54] should have seen
[8899.54 → 8900.00] this coming
[8900.00 → 8900.40] and should have
[8900.40 → 8900.84] done better
[8900.84 → 8901.18] but
[8901.18 → 8903.08] I don't know
[8903.08 → 8903.28] you
[8903.28 → 8905.74] you build a
[8905.74 → 8906.40] bigger lock
[8906.40 → 8906.96] and someone's
[8906.96 → 8907.54] going to build a
[8907.54 → 8908.26] bigger bolt cutter
[8908.26 → 8908.50] right
[8908.50 → 8908.96] like I
[8908.96 → 8909.84] also don't
[8909.84 → 8910.34] quite
[8910.34 → 8912.26] they got
[8912.26 → 8912.76] they got
[8912.76 → 8913.48] really kind
[8913.48 → 8913.88] of f**KED
[8913.88 → 8914.28] on over
[8914.28 → 8914.68] this
[8914.68 → 8915.46] and that
[8915.46 → 8915.74] sucks
[8915.74 → 8915.82] a lot of security
[8915.82 → 8916.70] is not
[8916.70 → 8917.40] it's just a
[8917.40 → 8918.04] bigger delay
[8918.04 → 8919.10] ideally
[8919.10 → 8919.90] there's
[8919.90 → 8920.88] nothing better
[8920.88 → 8921.60] than that
[8921.60 → 8923.52] to try to
[8923.52 → 8924.00] reduce the
[8924.00 → 8924.56] impact of
[8924.56 → 8925.18] these scams
[8925.18 → 8925.96] Seagate partners
[8925.96 → 8926.78] are now being
[8926.78 → 8927.42] required to
[8927.42 → 8927.98] purchase and
[8927.98 → 8928.68] resell drives
[8928.68 → 8929.90] exclusively from
[8929.90 → 8930.60] authorized
[8930.60 → 8931.10] distributors
[8931.10 → 8931.62] and this is why
[8931.62 → 8932.22] we can't have
[8932.22 → 8932.88] nice things
[8932.88 → 8934.20] because I
[8934.20 → 8935.02] would love
[8935.02 → 8936.18] for you to
[8936.18 → 8937.10] be able to
[8937.10 → 8937.60] you know
[8937.60 → 8939.20] buy and sell
[8939.20 → 8941.56] and move
[8941.56 → 8942.32] older parts
[8942.32 → 8943.06] around as
[8943.06 → 8943.52] needed
[8943.52 → 8948.86] but now all
[8948.86 → 8949.18] of a sudden
[8949.18 → 8949.76] we need this
[8949.76 → 8950.40] like central
[8950.40 → 8951.12] administration
[8951.12 → 8952.14] of everything
[8952.14 → 8952.80] and tracking
[8952.80 → 8953.44] of everything
[8953.44 → 8953.88] and it
[8953.88 → 8954.52] and it
[8954.52 → 8955.16] legitimately
[8955.16 → 8956.28] adds cost
[8956.28 → 8957.04] it's not that
[8957.04 → 8957.32] they're just
[8957.32 → 8957.76] going to like
[8957.76 → 8958.08] you know
[8958.08 → 8958.64] gouge or
[8958.64 → 8958.92] whatever
[8958.92 → 8959.52] because there's
[8959.52 → 8960.16] no competition
[8960.16 → 8960.52] but it
[8960.52 → 8961.28] legitimately
[8961.28 → 8962.00] adds overhead
[8962.00 → 8962.46] and cost
[8962.46 → 8962.70] and that
[8962.70 → 8963.54] just blows
[8963.54 → 8964.28] for everyone
[8964.28 → 8966.52] kind of
[8966.52 → 8967.12] wrecks
[8967.12 → 8967.56] the
[8967.56 → 8968.74] use market
[8968.74 → 8969.20] people are
[8969.20 → 8969.56] asking if
[8969.56 → 8969.94] server part
[8969.94 → 8970.32] deals is
[8970.32 → 8970.68] an authorized
[8970.68 → 8971.00] reseller
[8971.00 → 8971.46] I don't
[8971.46 → 8971.92] know
[8971.92 → 8974.60] someone want
[8974.60 → 8974.90] to look that
[8974.90 → 8975.08] up
[8975.08 → 8975.54] you figure it
[8975.54 → 8975.72] out
[8975.72 → 8975.96] yeah
[8975.96 → 8976.52] Tim also
[8976.52 → 8977.06] points out
[8977.06 → 8977.48] it doesn't
[8977.48 → 8978.00] matter if they
[8978.00 → 8978.32] make their
[8978.32 → 8978.90] smart values
[8978.90 → 8979.30] harder to
[8979.30 → 8979.74] overwrite
[8979.74 → 8980.82] because they
[8980.82 → 8981.46] can also just
[8981.46 → 8982.10] overwrite the
[8982.10 → 8982.80] smart values of
[8982.80 → 8983.32] cheap crap
[8983.32 → 8983.86] drives and
[8983.86 → 8984.28] call them
[8984.28 → 8984.70] Seagate
[8984.70 → 8985.66] I knew
[8985.66 → 8986.20] server part
[8986.20 → 8986.56] deals was
[8986.56 → 8987.12] legit I
[8987.12 → 8987.40] didn't know
[8987.40 → 8987.72] if they were
[8987.72 → 8988.06] an authorized
[8988.06 → 8988.54] reseller
[8988.54 → 8988.98] there aren't
[8988.98 → 8989.32] that many
[8989.32 → 8990.08] cheap crap
[8990.08 → 8990.62] hard drives
[8990.62 → 8990.92] out there
[8990.92 → 8991.22] like there's
[8991.22 → 8991.88] only a handful
[8991.88 → 8992.40] of hard drive
[8992.40 → 8992.98] manufacturers
[8992.98 → 8993.64] even left
[8993.64 → 8994.16] so I'm not
[8994.16 → 8995.02] 100% sure
[8995.02 → 8995.58] on that one
[8995.58 → 8996.04] but anyway
[8998.74 → 9001.18] very cool
[9001.18 → 9001.70] I'm not
[9001.70 → 9002.18] surprised
[9002.18 → 9003.06] they're very
[9003.06 → 9003.38] legit
[9003.38 → 9003.70] but
[9003.70 → 9006.72] yeah
[9006.72 → 9008.00] so Seagate
[9008.00 → 9008.48] has implemented
[9008.48 → 9009.20] a global trade
[9009.20 → 9009.78] screening process
[9009.78 → 9010.20] to try to
[9010.20 → 9010.56] identify
[9010.56 → 9011.04] suspicious
[9011.04 → 9011.66] suppliers
[9011.66 → 9012.46] and Seagate
[9012.46 → 9012.88] reminds
[9012.88 → 9013.48] customers
[9013.48 → 9015.42] to exercise
[9015.42 → 9016.12] caution when
[9016.12 → 9016.72] buying drives
[9016.72 → 9017.50] from non-major
[9017.50 → 9018.18] retailers or
[9018.18 → 9018.60] third-party
[9018.60 → 9018.96] sellers
[9018.96 → 9019.74] Toward the
[9019.74 → 9020.40] Blue in
[9020.40 → 9021.08] float plane chat
[9021.08 → 9021.66] also says
[9021.66 → 9022.12] your viewers
[9022.12 → 9022.52] should know
[9022.52 → 9022.98] that Seagate
[9022.98 → 9023.46] released a
[9023.46 → 9023.84] tool where
[9023.84 → 9024.12] you can
[9024.12 → 9024.74] check values
[9024.74 → 9025.06] that are
[9025.06 → 9025.64] not able
[9025.64 → 9025.92] to be
[9025.92 → 9026.28] rewritten
[9026.28 → 9027.26] so that's
[9027.26 → 9027.64] pretty cool
[9027.64 → 9028.02] at least
[9028.02 → 9030.42] they're doing
[9030.42 → 9031.72] things about
[9031.72 → 9032.58] this even
[9032.58 → 9033.74] though none
[9033.74 → 9034.12] of this should
[9034.12 → 9034.54] have happened
[9034.54 → 9035.10] people should
[9035.10 → 9035.62] just not be
[9035.62 → 9036.52] buttheads
[9036.52 → 9038.72] Hilbert Gilbertson
[9038.72 → 9040.42] said that it's
[9040.42 → 9041.14] in C-Tools
[9041.14 → 9041.80] which makes
[9041.80 → 9042.12] sense
[9042.12 → 9043.04] very cool
[9043.04 → 9044.82] the DOG
[9044.82 → 9045.54] Xbox Ally
[9045.54 → 9045.96] has gotten
[9045.96 → 9046.58] a release date
[9046.58 → 9047.52] alongside a
[9047.52 → 9048.02] new game
[9048.02 → 9048.90] verification
[9048.90 → 9049.46] program
[9049.46 → 9049.80] before we go
[9049.80 → 9050.04] into that
[9050.04 → 9050.46] really quick
[9050.46 → 9050.84] I just want
[9050.84 → 9051.10] to say
[9051.10 → 9051.54] it's kind
[9051.54 → 9051.82] of cool
[9051.82 → 9052.12] that
[9052.12 → 9052.64] was negative
[9052.64 → 9053.24] news but
[9053.24 → 9053.56] had an
[9053.56 → 9053.96] interesting
[9053.96 → 9054.48] and cool
[9054.48 → 9054.94] story
[9054.94 → 9055.50] yeah
[9055.50 → 9056.14] I thought
[9056.14 → 9056.42] you'd like
[9056.42 → 9056.76] that one
[9056.76 → 9057.12] I like
[9057.12 → 9057.40] that
[9057.40 → 9058.14] that is
[9058.14 → 9058.56] very cool
[9058.56 → 9059.20] I'd love
[9059.20 → 9059.64] to see
[9059.64 → 9059.94] one of
[9059.94 → 9060.42] these places
[9060.42 → 9060.76] that would
[9060.76 → 9061.44] be so
[9061.44 → 9061.78] wicked
[9061.78 → 9062.30] anyone from
[9062.30 → 9062.64] Seagate
[9062.64 → 9063.02] watching
[9063.02 → 9064.22] I'll get
[9064.22 → 9064.48] on a
[9064.48 → 9064.78] plane
[9064.78 → 9066.04] let's go
[9066.04 → 9066.68] let's go
[9066.68 → 9067.04] check it
[9067.04 → 9067.26] out
[9067.26 → 9067.86] because
[9067.86 → 9070.40] it feels
[9070.40 → 9070.80] like it'd
[9070.80 → 9071.34] be if
[9071.34 → 9072.74] the kind
[9072.74 → 9073.06] of thing
[9073.06 → 9073.50] where if
[9073.50 → 9074.44] Rick Sanchez
[9074.44 → 9075.94] and Milhouse
[9075.94 → 9077.04] Van Often
[9077.04 → 9079.26] made a
[9079.26 → 9079.86] meth lab
[9079.86 → 9081.78] tech meth
[9081.78 → 9082.22] lab
[9082.22 → 9083.36] that's what
[9083.36 → 9083.66] I'm kind
[9083.66 → 9084.24] of imagining
[9084.24 → 9084.98] I think
[9084.98 → 9085.34] it would
[9085.34 → 9085.60] be
[9085.60 → 9085.94] it would
[9085.94 → 9086.30] honestly
[9086.30 → 9086.70] be a
[9086.70 → 9087.44] perfect
[9087.44 → 9088.34] Dexter's
[9088.34 → 9088.64] in there
[9088.64 → 9089.02] somewhere
[9089.02 → 9089.78] and like
[9089.78 → 9091.24] Jason Fox
[9091.24 → 9092.16] you know
[9092.16 → 9092.60] like just
[9092.60 → 9096.28] I think
[9096.28 → 9096.48] it would
[9096.48 → 9096.90] be really
[9096.90 → 9097.18] good
[9097.18 → 9097.64] exposure
[9097.64 → 9098.28] for
[9098.28 → 9099.02] the
[9099.02 → 9100.70] communication
[9100.70 → 9101.02] they're trying
[9101.02 → 9101.20] to get
[9101.20 → 9101.64] across
[9101.64 → 9102.18] of like
[9102.18 → 9102.54] making sure
[9102.54 → 9102.82] you're getting
[9102.82 → 9103.14] legitimate
[9103.14 → 9103.50] drives
[9103.50 → 9104.28] making sure
[9104.28 → 9104.68] that you can
[9104.68 → 9105.22] check your
[9105.22 → 9105.80] drives using
[9105.80 → 9106.52] tools if you
[9106.52 → 9106.78] were going to
[9106.78 → 9107.28] buy off of
[9107.28 → 9107.62] the used
[9107.62 → 9108.04] market or
[9108.04 → 9108.32] something
[9108.32 → 9108.92] you could
[9108.92 → 9109.30] check the
[9109.30 → 9109.82] drive before
[9109.82 → 9110.16] you actually
[9110.16 → 9110.48] do the
[9110.48 → 9110.96] exchange
[9110.96 → 9112.40] and promoting
[9112.40 → 9112.86] their whole
[9112.86 → 9113.60] authorized reseller
[9113.60 → 9114.34] thing I think
[9114.34 → 9114.90] it makes a ton
[9114.90 → 9115.64] of sense and
[9115.64 → 9116.04] it would be
[9116.04 → 9116.90] wicked for
[9116.90 → 9118.30] content I
[9118.30 → 9118.84] think Seagate
[9118.84 → 9119.26] should do it
[9119.26 → 9119.58] with you I
[9119.58 → 9119.90] think that would
[9119.90 → 9120.46] be fantastic
[9120.46 → 9121.00] yeah if anyone
[9121.00 → 9121.56] knows anyone
[9121.56 → 9122.44] who's at Seagate
[9122.44 → 9123.40] like hit him
[9123.40 → 9123.76] up that would
[9123.76 → 9124.24] be wicked
[9124.24 → 9124.80] content that
[9124.80 → 9125.06] would be
[9125.06 → 9125.36] freaking
[9125.36 → 9125.92] awesome
[9125.92 → 9126.74] very cool
[9126.74 → 9127.42] all right
[9127.42 → 9127.88] Microsoft
[9127.88 → 9128.48] announced at
[9128.48 → 9129.24] Gamescom that
[9129.24 → 9130.08] the new DOG
[9130.08 → 9130.72] Xbox Ally
[9130.72 → 9131.44] handheld will be
[9131.44 → 9132.04] arriving on
[9132.04 → 9132.68] store shelves on
[9132.68 → 9134.62] October 16th
[9134.62 → 9135.60] and with it
[9135.60 → 9136.38] the new
[9136.38 → 9137.00] handheld
[9137.00 → 9137.60] compatibility
[9137.60 → 9138.60] program an
[9138.60 → 9139.44] initiative similar
[9139.44 → 9139.96] to the Steam
[9139.96 → 9140.54] DEX compatibility
[9140.54 → 9141.38] program designed
[9141.38 → 9141.90] to make more
[9141.90 → 9142.58] games ready to
[9142.58 → 9143.20] play on your

[9144.14 → 9145.76] handheld like
[9145.76 → 9146.42] Valve's initiative
[9146.42 → 9146.88] there will be
[9146.88 → 9147.96] three tiers of
[9147.96 → 9149.30] rankings incompatible
[9149.30 → 9150.26] mostly compatible
[9150.26 → 9151.20] and handheld
[9151.20 → 9152.88] optimized Xbox
[9152.88 → 9153.90] also announced
[9153.90 → 9154.74] the gaming
[9154.74 → 9155.74] co-pilot beta
[9155.74 → 9156.62] via game bar
[9156.62 → 9157.62] a personalized
[9157.62 → 9158.50] AI gaming
[9158.50 → 9159.20] companion that
[9159.20 → 9160.04] helps you get
[9160.04 → 9160.64] to your favourite
[9160.64 → 9161.46] games faster
[9161.46 → 9162.72] improve your

[9163.80 → 9164.64] offers context
[9164.64 → 9165.34] aware support
[9165.34 → 9166.10] based on what
[9166.10 → 9166.60] you're playing
[9166.60 → 9174.32] okay
[9174.32 → 9175.18] after being
[9175.18 → 9175.70] spotted via
[9175.70 → 9176.52] benchmark leak
[9176.52 → 9177.46] steam machines
[9177.46 → 9178.26] are back on
[9178.26 → 9178.72] the menu
[9178.72 → 9179.48] boys
[9179.48 → 9180.12] let's go
[9180.12 → 9180.80] after months
[9180.80 → 9181.24] of rumours
[9181.24 → 9181.88] the existence
[9181.88 → 9183.14] of Valve's
[9183.14 → 9183.80] Fremont
[9183.80 → 9184.68] PC box
[9184.68 → 9185.50] slash console
[9185.50 → 9186.00] has been
[9186.00 → 9186.78] leaked through
[9186.78 → 9187.38] benchmarks on
[9187.38 → 9188.04] geek bench as
[9188.04 → 9188.90] well as some
[9188.90 → 9189.40] of the specs
[9189.40 → 9190.42] listed down
[9190.42 → 9190.80] below
[9190.80 → 9192.26] the processor
[9192.26 → 9193.30] codename
[9193.30 → 9194.14] Hawk Point
[9194.14 → 9195.14] 2 is likely
[9195.14 → 9195.72] a refresh
[9195.72 → 9196.54] of Phoenix
[9196.54 → 9197.40] 2 the
[9197.40 → 9198.04] younger and
[9198.04 → 9199.16] smaller cousin
[9199.16 → 9199.92] of the Z1
[9199.92 → 9200.48] extreme
[9200.48 → 9201.64] Valve's first
[9201.64 → 9202.06] attempt to
[9202.06 → 9202.72] add a console
[9202.72 → 9203.42] like steam
[9203.42 → 9204.22] machine experience
[9204.22 → 9204.82] released nearly
[9204.82 → 9206.04] a decade ago
[9206.04 → 9207.58] to whatever
[9207.58 → 9208.24] the opposite
[9208.24 → 9209.02] of fanfare
[9209.02 → 9210.08] is but
[9210.08 → 9212.18] I feel
[9212.18 → 9213.28] very strongly
[9213.28 → 9213.86] I think we're
[9213.86 → 9214.34] in a different
[9214.34 → 9215.30] realm
[9215.30 → 9215.80] that this is
[9215.80 → 9216.20] a different
[9216.20 → 9216.74] time
[9216.74 → 9217.76] this is a
[9217.76 → 9218.92] different valve
[9218.92 → 9219.86] a more focused
[9219.86 → 9220.80] valve and
[9220.80 → 9221.80] it's a different
[9221.80 → 9222.72] Linux in no
[9222.72 → 9223.26] small part
[9223.26 → 9224.06] thanks to the
[9224.06 → 9224.64] efforts that
[9224.64 → 9225.52] Valve has made
[9225.52 → 9226.62] to push forward
[9226.62 → 9227.84] gaming on
[9227.84 → 9228.62] Linux
[9228.62 → 9229.62] very dramatically
[9229.62 → 9230.28] different Linux
[9230.28 → 9231.14] here we have
[9231.14 → 9231.84] specs
[9231.84 → 9233.74] before you actually
[9233.74 → 9234.30] do that
[9234.30 → 9234.84] okay
[9234.84 → 9236.76] I'm gonna use
[9236.76 → 9237.20] this as a
[9237.20 → 9238.02] shameless plug
[9238.02 → 9239.90] for the
[9239.90 → 9241.10] is 2025
[9241.10 → 9241.72] the year of the
[9241.72 → 9242.24] Linux desktop
[9242.24 → 9242.96] part 1 and 2
[9242.96 → 9243.98] articles on
[9243.98 → 9244.74] the lab site
[9244.74 → 9245.40] heck yeah
[9245.40 → 9246.66] so yeah
[9246.66 → 9247.22] very different
[9247.22 → 9247.54] Linux
[9247.54 → 9248.70] sorry keep going
[9248.70 → 9249.80] heck yeah
[9249.80 → 9250.96] alright
[9250.96 → 9251.90] back here
[9251.90 → 9252.36] so okay
[9252.36 → 9253.22] we get six
[9253.22 → 9253.76] cores
[9253.76 → 9259.20] nice little
[9259.20 → 9259.62] level 3
[9259.62 → 9259.98] cache
[9259.98 → 9261.48] and
[9261.48 → 9262.86] that's about
[9262.86 → 9263.30] all we know
[9263.30 → 9264.92] oh there you
[9264.92 → 9265.16] go
[9265.16 → 9266.58] there's a
[9266.58 → 9267.00] geek bench
[9267.00 → 9267.26] score
[9267.26 → 9269.22] good job
[9269.22 → 9269.56] everyone
[9269.56 → 9271.30] I'm stoked
[9271.30 → 9272.16] I
[9272.16 → 9272.72] I
[9272.72 → 9275.44] I have
[9275.44 → 9276.02] had
[9276.02 → 9276.90] a little
[9276.90 → 9277.72] machine
[9277.72 → 9279.08] sitting in
[9279.08 → 9279.44] my family
[9279.44 → 9279.78] room
[9279.78 → 9281.08] just like
[9281.08 → 9282.54] ready
[9282.54 → 9283.36] for Steam
[9283.36 → 9283.72] OS
[9283.72 → 9285.12] it actually
[9285.12 → 9285.74] what does it
[9285.74 → 9286.08] have running
[9286.08 → 9286.58] on it now
[9286.58 → 9287.12] it has an
[9287.12 → 9287.82] Nvidia GPU
[9287.82 → 9288.36] and it uses
[9288.36 → 9288.96] an MXM
[9288.96 → 9289.74] module so it's
[9289.74 → 9290.50] like non-trivial
[9290.50 → 9291.24] to put an AMD
[9291.24 → 9291.88] GPU in it
[9291.88 → 9292.24] whatever it
[9292.24 → 9292.74] doesn't matter
[9292.74 → 9293.44] just relax
[9293.44 → 9295.08] but I haven't
[9295.08 → 9295.54] been doing much
[9295.54 → 9296.00] with it, I think
[9296.00 → 9296.46] it still has
[9296.46 → 9297.20] Windows on it
[9297.20 → 9298.98] because even
[9298.98 → 9299.82] the like the
[9299.82 → 9300.38] Steam OS
[9300.38 → 9300.84] alike
[9300.84 → 9303.24] prefer AMD
[9303.24 → 9304.08] GPUs from
[9304.08 → 9304.76] my understanding
[9304.76 → 9305.90] so it's been
[9305.90 → 9306.42] sitting there
[9306.42 → 9307.16] kind of waiting
[9307.16 → 9307.88] for Steam OS
[9307.88 → 9308.42] to be
[9308.42 → 9309.48] vendor-agnostic
[9309.48 → 9310.04] and just like
[9310.04 → 9310.56] ready for any
[9310.56 → 9311.02] PC
[9311.02 → 9312.20] starting to
[9312.20 → 9312.84] you know
[9312.84 → 9314.06] hopes fading
[9314.06 → 9314.66] a little bit
[9314.66 → 9315.90] but I think
[9315.90 → 9316.34] I could be
[9316.34 → 9316.84] convinced to

[9349.78 → 9349.96] coming
[9349.96 → 9350.14] with
[9350.14 → 9350.26] the

[9350.78 → 9351.30] kind
[9351.30 → 9351.82] of

[9354.00 → 9354.20] hands
[9354.20 → 9354.44] on
[9354.44 → 9354.72] fair
[9354.72 → 9354.92] enough
[9354.92 → 9355.56] it's
[9355.56 → 9357.18] the
[9357.18 → 9358.30] efficiency
[9358.30 → 9358.80] gains
[9358.80 → 9359.24] that they
[9359.24 → 9359.48] are
[9359.48 → 9359.86] saying
[9359.86 → 9360.16] they've
[9360.16 → 9360.52] achieved
[9360.52 → 9360.82] are
[9360.82 → 9361.54] it's
[9361.54 → 9361.70] not
[9361.70 → 9361.94] Steam
[9361.94 → 9362.14] OS
[9362.14 → 9362.42] level
[9362.42 → 9362.86] efficient
[9362.86 → 9363.52] at least
[9363.52 → 9363.70] not
[9363.70 → 9364.00] now
[9364.00 → 9365.26] but
[9365.26 → 9365.52] they're
[9365.52 → 9365.90] they're
[9365.90 → 9366.08] making
[9366.08 → 9366.44] gains
[9366.44 → 9367.16] like
[9367.16 → 9367.32] they
[9367.32 → 9367.68] literally
[9367.68 → 9368.14] don't
[9368.14 → 9368.36] even
[9368.36 → 9368.64] render
[9368.64 → 9368.80] the
[9368.80 → 9369.08] desktop
[9369.08 → 9369.26] in
[9369.26 → 9369.36] the
[9369.36 → 9369.66] background
[9369.66 → 9370.20] when
[9370.20 → 9370.36] they're
[9370.36 → 9370.54] running
[9370.54 → 9370.76] in
[9370.76 → 9371.00] gaming
[9371.00 → 9371.26] mode
[9371.26 → 9371.42] on

[9371.56 → 9371.72] new

[9375.68 → 9376.02] have a ton
[9376.02 → 9376.12] of
[9376.12 → 9376.48] confidence
[9376.48 → 9376.72] either

[9379.12 → 9379.64] with
[9379.64 → 9379.96] Windows
[9379.96 → 9380.96] like
[9380.96 → 9382.70] went in
[9382.70 → 9383.14] and you
[9383.14 → 9383.44] can't

[9444.48 → 9444.64] been
[9444.64 → 9445.02] fine

[9453.24 → 9453.42] my
[9453.42 → 9453.88] laptop
[9453.88 → 9454.42] so
[9454.42 → 9454.60] this
[9454.60 → 9454.80] is
[9454.80 → 9455.12] one
[9455.12 → 9455.20] of
[9455.20 → 9455.30] the

[9457.84 → 9458.28] flow
[9458.28 → 9459.22] X13
[9459.22 → 9460.02] we'll
[9460.02 → 9460.18] make
[9460.18 → 9460.68] probably
[9460.68 → 9460.98] be a
[9460.98 → 9461.16] video
[9461.16 → 9461.32] I'll

[9461.56 → 9461.76] fix
[9461.76 → 9461.90] it
[9461.90 → 9462.18] anyway
[9462.18 → 9462.94] the
[9462.94 → 9463.14] point
[9463.14 → 9463.30] is
[9463.30 → 9463.42] I
[9463.42 → 9463.62] switched

[9464.24 → 9464.92] snapdragon
[9464.92 → 9465.32] machine
[9465.32 → 9466.18] and
[9466.18 → 9466.66] I
[9466.66 → 9467.08] grabbed
[9467.08 → 9467.20] it
[9467.20 → 9467.30] out
[9467.30 → 9467.34] of
[9467.34 → 9467.46] my

[9470.64 → 9470.82] our
[9470.82 → 9471.08] kids
[9471.08 → 9471.58] video
[9471.58 → 9471.76] that

[9471.86 → 9471.98] did
[9471.98 → 9472.14] with
[9472.14 → 9472.38] David
[9472.38 → 9472.76] today

[9473.64 → 9473.92] hot
[9473.92 → 9475.70] it
[9475.70 → 9475.86] was
[9475.86 → 9476.34] closed
[9476.34 → 9477.60] and
[9477.60 → 9477.70] it
[9477.70 → 9477.82] was
[9477.82 → 9478.18] on

[9478.84 → 9479.14] how
[9479.14 → 9479.30] is
[9479.30 → 9479.46] that
[9479.46 → 9479.88] still
[9479.88 → 9480.14] not
[9480.14 → 9480.56] fixed
[9480.56 → 9480.98] yep
[9480.98 → 9483.00] that's
[9483.00 → 9483.36] insane

[9564.48 → 9564.80] Windows
[9564.80 → 9565.00] 7
[9565.00 → 9565.20] was
[9565.20 → 9565.86] amazing
[9565.86 → 9566.14] when's
[9566.14 → 9566.42] the last
[9566.42 → 9566.64] time
[9566.64 → 9567.12] Microsoft

[9571.56 → 9572.22] okay never mind
[9572.22 → 9572.98] I feel like
[9572.98 → 9573.44] there used to be
[9573.44 → 9573.90] a lot more
[9573.90 → 9574.46] fanfare
[9574.46 → 9575.58] around like
[9575.58 → 9576.26] DirectX
[9576.26 → 9576.76] and gaming
[9576.76 → 9577.70] on Windows
[9577.70 → 9578.84] and I mean
[9578.84 → 9579.44] this whole
[9579.44 → 9579.90] I mean
[9579.90 → 9581.92] the new
[9581.92 → 9582.82] stripped down
[9582.82 → 9583.22] you know
[9583.22 → 9583.58] Windows
[9583.58 → 9584.44] gaming
[9584.44 → 9585.12] it just
[9585.12 → 9585.60] it feels like
[9585.60 → 9585.98] it's too late
[9585.98 → 9586.44] to me
[9586.44 → 9586.94] that's fair
[9586.94 → 9587.74] if they were
[9587.74 → 9588.42] working on this
[9588.42 → 9588.90] remember
[9588.90 → 9590.10] remember game mode
[9590.10 → 9590.88] when it was
[9590.88 → 9591.42] just like
[9591.42 → 9592.78] I don't even
[9592.78 → 9593.24] remember what
[9593.24 → 9593.78] was so bad
[9593.78 → 9594.04] about it
[9594.04 → 9594.38] but I remember
[9594.38 → 9595.02] testing in the
[9595.02 → 9595.62] in the bench
[9595.62 → 9595.94] stand just
[9595.94 → 9596.24] being like

[9599.86 → 9600.74] Live was like
[9600.74 → 9601.62] the worst thing
[9601.62 → 9601.86] ever
[9601.86 → 9602.40] yeah it was
[9602.40 → 9602.86] pretty bad
[9602.86 → 9605.60] like Microsoft
[9605.60 → 9606.70] gaming networking
[9606.70 → 9607.74] I'm going to say
[9607.74 → 9608.34] now
[9608.34 → 9609.32] this is not
[9609.32 → 9609.86] a now

[9611.32 → 9611.62] came out
[9611.62 → 9612.00] it was super
[9612.00 → 9612.30] annoying
[9612.30 → 9613.14] it's super
[9613.14 → 9613.66] annoying to just
[9613.66 → 9614.10] like play
[9614.10 → 9614.36] Halo
[9614.36 → 9614.82] randomly

[9622.46 → 9622.88] the world
[9622.88 → 9623.42] is just like
[9623.42 → 9623.80] whoop
[9623.80 → 9625.00] when running
[9625.00 → 9625.40] Linux
[9625.40 → 9626.18] has been
[9626.18 → 9626.60] actually
[9626.60 → 9627.60] less annoying
[9627.60 → 9629.06] oof

[9634.66 → 9635.24] in my way
[9635.24 → 9636.50] I have had
[9636.50 → 9637.22] to do
[9637.22 → 9637.94] things to it

[9672.20 → 9672.66] phone
[9672.66 → 9674.48] is just
[9674.48 → 9675.48] an image
[9675.48 → 9676.80] that they
[9676.80 → 9677.54] ripped off
[9677.54 → 9680.32] this accessory
[9680.32 → 9681.68] manufacturer's
[9681.68 → 9682.46] website
[9682.46 → 9684.44] is that
[9684.44 → 9685.02] wild
[9685.02 → 9685.80] or what
[9685.80 → 9686.36] yeah
[9686.36 → 9687.12] um

[9697.32 → 9697.86] so sorry
[9697.86 → 9698.10] if I'm
[9698.10 → 9698.52] saying this

[9700.12 → 9700.72] thin fit

[9701.12 → 9701.50] you can
[9701.50 → 9702.02] even
[9702.02 → 9702.66] see their
[9702.66 → 9703.12] logo
[9703.12 → 9704.04] under the

[9704.72 → 9704.92] on
[9704.92 → 9706.04] American flag
[9706.04 → 9707.40] what a
[9707.40 → 9708.88] lazy job
[9708.88 → 9709.94] you need to
[9709.94 → 9710.44] rip people
[9710.44 → 9711.12] off better
[9711.12 → 9712.38] our notes
[9712.38 → 9713.34] unfortunately
[9713.34 → 9714.54] say
[9714.54 → 9715.26] pagan
[9715.26 → 9718.20] looks photoshopped
[9718.20 → 9718.96] you can tell
[9718.96 → 9719.40] by the way
[9719.40 → 9719.86] it is
[9719.86 → 9721.20] we all know
[9721.20 → 9722.00] that it's
[9722.00 → 9722.46] it looks
[9722.46 → 9723.20] photoshopped
[9723.20 → 9723.68] you can tell
[9723.68 → 9724.40] by the pixels
[9724.40 → 9725.40] the crazy part
[9725.40 → 9725.84] is it would
[9725.84 → 9726.14] have been
[9726.14 → 9727.14] so easy
[9727.14 → 9728.16] to do
[9728.16 → 9728.46] this
[9728.46 → 9729.40] not terribly
[9729.40 → 9730.64] that's the
[9730.64 → 9731.34] the weirdest part
[9731.34 → 9731.72] for me
[9731.72 → 9732.70] I know
[9732.70 → 9733.06] it would
[9733.06 → 9733.50] have taken
[9733.50 → 9734.46] seconds
[9734.46 → 9735.20] more
[9735.20 → 9735.92] I know
[9735.92 → 9736.24] like
[9736.24 → 9739.90] I do
[9739.90 → 9740.34] kind of
[9740.34 → 9740.84] wonder when
[9740.84 → 9741.28] stuff like
[9741.28 → 9741.92] this happens
[9741.92 → 9742.86] and you know
[9742.86 → 9743.88] this might
[9743.88 → 9744.42] be
[9744.42 → 9746.06] hypocritical
[9746.06 → 9747.04] because earlier
[9747.04 → 9747.52] in the show
[9747.52 → 9748.14] I talked about
[9748.14 → 9748.50] how like
[9748.50 → 9748.70] you know
[9748.70 → 9749.30] we're humans
[9749.30 → 9749.66] we make
[9749.66 → 9750.10] mistakes
[9750.10 → 9750.66] sometimes
[9750.66 → 9751.52] but like
[9751.52 → 9752.48] when a mistake
[9752.48 → 9753.12] like that
[9753.12 → 9753.56] happens
[9753.56 → 9754.10] I wonder
[9754.10 → 9754.34] like
[9754.34 → 9754.72] is this
[9754.72 → 9754.92] someone
[9754.92 → 9755.34] inside
[9755.34 → 9755.72] just being
[9755.72 → 9755.98] like
[9755.98 → 9756.34] you know
[9756.34 → 9757.22] I need
[9757.22 → 9757.78] a job
[9757.78 → 9758.94] so I'm
[9758.94 → 9759.30] going to do
[9759.30 → 9759.94] my job
[9759.94 → 9760.54] but also
[9760.54 → 9760.86] I'm gonna
[9760.86 → 9761.38] leave some
[9761.38 → 9762.02] like Easter
[9762.02 → 9762.68] eggs in there
[9762.68 → 9763.32] that people
[9763.32 → 9763.92] will find
[9763.92 → 9764.70] so that people
[9764.70 → 9765.12] know this
[9765.12 → 9765.58] is stupid
[9765.58 → 9767.26] I kind
[9767.26 → 9767.70] of wonder
[9767.70 → 9768.18] sometimes
[9768.18 → 9768.64] because that's
[9768.64 → 9769.04] a wild
[9769.04 → 9769.56] mistake
[9769.56 → 9771.08] I ripped
[9771.08 → 9771.58] off this
[9771.58 → 9771.94] case and
[9771.94 → 9772.42] just left
[9772.42 → 9772.98] the logo
[9772.98 → 9773.48] on it
[9773.48 → 9774.64] I don't
[9774.64 → 9774.92] know
[9774.92 → 9776.46] the site
[9776.46 → 9778.02] still has
[9778.02 → 9778.64] the old
[9778.64 → 9779.06] version
[9779.06 → 9779.74] of the
[9779.74 → 9780.38] quote unquote
[9780.38 → 9781.08] the T1
[9781.08 → 9781.56] phone that
[9781.56 → 9782.00] will never
[9782.00 → 9782.70] exist and
[9782.70 → 9783.04] isn't
[9783.04 → 9783.36] real
[9783.36 → 9783.98] yeah
[9783.98 → 9788.00] how is
[9788.00 → 9788.40] this not
[9788.40 → 9788.78] such a
[9788.78 → 9789.36] huge tell
[9789.36 → 9789.94] for people
[9789.94 → 9793.08] anyway
[9793.08 → 9793.56] that's a
[9793.56 → 9793.88] longer
[9793.88 → 9794.50] conversation
[9794.50 → 9794.98] anyway
[9794.98 → 9797.34] moving on
[9797.34 → 9799.06] Nvidia
[9799.06 → 9799.84] throws a
[9799.84 → 9800.24] couple of

[9807.16 → 9808.90] DLSS 4

[9816.26 → 9817.28] install to
[9817.28 → 9817.52] play
[9817.52 → 9818.00] lets you
[9818.00 → 9818.90] also install
[9818.90 → 9819.74] games on
[9819.74 → 9820.06] your cloud
[9820.06 → 9820.92] PC if
[9820.92 → 9821.34] the dev
[9821.34 → 9821.78] has enabled
[9821.78 → 9822.24] Steam
[9822.24 → 9822.74] cloud
[9822.74 → 9823.64] streaming
[9823.64 → 9824.94] there is a
[9824.94 → 9825.24] bit of a
[9825.24 → 9825.68] catch you
[9825.68 → 9826.20] have to
[9826.20 → 9827.56] install your
[9827.56 → 9828.38] game every
[9828.38 → 9829.38] time and
[9829.38 → 9829.78] there is a
[9829.78 → 9830.32] finite amount
[9830.32 → 9830.90] of storage
[9830.90 → 9831.60] on your
[9831.60 → 9832.12] instance
[9832.12 → 9832.90] you do have
[9832.90 → 9833.12] to pay
[9833.12 → 9833.78] extra to get
[9833.78 → 9834.30] more storage
[9834.30 → 9834.62] from my
[9834.62 → 9835.08] understanding
[9835.08 → 9835.60] so it's a
[9835.60 → 9836.26] little inconvenient
[9836.26 → 9837.44] to install
[9837.44 → 9837.94] your own
[9837.94 → 9838.42] games but
[9838.42 → 9838.90] hey at least
[9838.90 → 9839.30] it's there
[9839.30 → 9839.90] bringing them a
[9839.90 → 9840.22] little bit
[9840.22 → 9840.88] closer to a
[9840.88 → 9841.50] more shadow
[9841.50 → 9842.78] like experience
[9842.78 → 9844.14] the NVIDIA

[9845.40 → 9846.24] automatically enable

[9847.70 → 9848.88] all games and
[9848.88 → 9849.62] adds control for
[9849.62 → 9850.14] a few more
[9850.14 → 9851.04] settings like
[9851.04 → 9851.54] NVIDIA
[9851.54 → 9852.44] Surround bringing
[9852.44 → 9853.04] it ever so
[9853.04 → 9854.32] slightly closer to
[9854.32 → 9854.96] being a viable
[9854.96 → 9856.00] replacement for
[9856.00 → 9856.48] the NVIDIA
[9856.48 → 9857.28] control panel
[9857.28 → 9858.76] NVIDIA has also
[9858.76 → 9859.32] teamed up with
[9859.32 → 9860.04] Discord bringing
[9860.04 → 9860.76] instant play
[9860.76 → 9861.56] experiences with
[9861.56 → 9862.18] GeForce Now
[9862.18 → 9863.52] inside Discord
[9863.52 → 9864.38] no install
[9864.38 → 9865.24] required just
[9865.24 → 9865.66] click a link
[9865.66 → 9866.16] from a friend
[9866.16 → 9867.16] and instantly
[9867.16 → 9867.88] load into a
[9867.88 → 9868.42] game to try
[9868.42 → 9869.92] it out that's
[9869.92 → 9870.40] right you can
[9870.40 → 9871.44] play any game
[9871.44 → 9872.14] you want as
[9872.14 → 9872.66] long as that
[9872.66 → 9873.00] game is
[9873.00 → 9874.46] Fortnite and
[9874.46 → 9874.90] you can only
[9874.90 → 9875.66] play for a
[9875.66 → 9876.30] 30 minute free
[9876.30 → 9877.32] trial that is
[9877.32 → 9878.08] still nuts
[9878.08 → 9880.06] that sounds like
[9880.06 → 9880.88] future I haven't
[9880.88 → 9881.82] heard future in a
[9881.82 → 9882.40] while that's
[9882.40 → 9882.88] pretty cool
[9882.88 → 9883.32] that's pretty
[9883.32 → 9885.60] cool I mean
[9885.60 → 9887.36] am I are we
[9887.36 → 9888.22] overestimating this
[9888.22 → 9888.70] is it literally
[9888.70 → 9889.38] just a link that
[9889.38 → 9889.98] opens a browser
[9889.98 → 9890.54] and you play the
[9890.54 → 9891.44] game it's still
[9891.44 → 9892.32] a cool thing
[9892.32 → 9892.76] it's still cool
[9892.76 → 9893.52] game streaming is
[9893.52 → 9893.90] one of those
[9893.90 → 9894.66] things that I'm
[9894.66 → 9896.16] I think is super
[9896.16 → 9897.42] cool I
[9897.42 → 9898.02] remember taking
[9898.02 → 9899.20] so much flack
[9899.20 → 9899.80] for that video
[9899.80 → 9900.40] I did like
[9900.40 → 9900.90] years and
[9900.90 → 9901.42] years ago
[9901.42 → 9902.52] comparing latency
[9902.52 → 9904.50] of local
[9904.50 → 9905.56] streaming over
[9905.56 → 9905.98] the internet
[9905.98 → 9906.90] streaming and
[9906.90 → 9907.80] than like
[9907.80 → 9909.04] rendering locally
[9909.04 → 9910.16] and saying
[9910.16 → 9911.02] anything other
[9911.02 → 9911.66] than that this
[9911.66 → 9912.50] is horrible and
[9912.50 → 9912.92] we should all
[9912.92 → 9913.48] hate it and
[9913.48 → 9914.74] resist it and
[9914.74 → 9915.22] people were like
[9915.22 → 9916.02] super mad at me
[9916.02 → 9916.50] about if it's
[9916.50 → 9916.96] like here we
[9916.96 → 9917.96] are it's pretty
[9917.96 → 9918.74] freaking cool and
[9918.74 → 9919.76] the latency once
[9919.76 → 9920.18] you're running at
[9920.18 → 9922.58] 120 FPS is not
[9922.58 → 9923.88] bad I'm kind of
[9923.88 → 9925.44] approaching magic at
[9925.44 → 9926.14] that point I mean
[9926.14 → 9926.70] we know what
[9926.70 → 9927.28] goes on but
[9927.28 → 9928.16] it's like I
[9928.16 → 9929.38] definitely would
[9929.38 → 9930.18] rather render
[9930.18 → 9931.36] locally but like
[9931.36 → 9933.86] if I didn't want
[9933.86 → 9934.76] to spend I mean I
[9934.76 → 9935.32] was at Best Buy
[9935.32 → 9936.26] today for that
[9936.26 → 9937.10] Chromebook video and
[9937.10 → 9938.32] it was 1700
[9938.32 → 9939.46] Canadian dollars for
[9939.46 → 9941.06] a 5080 I could
[9941.06 → 9942.30] buy a lot of
[9942.30 → 9943.14] f***ING G-Force
[9943.14 → 9945.26] now for 1700
[9945.26 → 9946.70] Canadian dollars
[9946.70 → 9949.86] it's compelling
[9949.86 → 9953.38] and that's it for
[9953.38 → 9954.14] topics it's time
[9954.14 → 9954.70] for After Dark
[9954.70 → 9956.86] came out of
[9956.86 → 9958.48] nowhere what did
[9958.48 → 9959.42] you find After
[9959.42 → 9960.16] Dark is that
[9960.16 → 9961.46] exciting yeah
[9961.46 → 9966.20] I like the
[9966.20 → 9966.72] After Dark part
[9966.72 → 9967.04] of the show
[9967.04 → 9968.40] always have

[10008.84 → 10009.34] away again
[10009.34 → 10010.46] somebody curated
[10010.46 → 10011.44] these were not
[10011.44 → 10011.68] mine
[10011.68 → 10012.54] Luke
[10012.54 → 10013.48] dang it
[10013.48 → 10013.94] no I didn't
[10013.94 → 10014.22] do it
[10014.22 → 10014.90] I didn't do it
[10014.90 → 10016.02] okay maybe they
[10016.02 → 10016.54] were accidents
[10016.54 → 10017.68] one of them was
[10017.68 → 10018.16] on purpose
[10018.16 → 10019.02] the nice
[10019.02 → 10019.82] shafts
[10019.82 → 10020.36] absolutely
[10020.36 → 10020.88] would have been
[10020.88 → 10021.34] an accident
[10021.34 → 10021.68] yeah
[10021.68 → 10023.70] I would have
[10023.70 → 10024.78] I would have
[10024.78 → 10025.52] responded in
[10025.52 → 10026.70] kind to our
[10026.70 → 10027.72] lovely
[10027.72 → 10029.36] store participants
[10029.36 → 10029.90] I feel like we
[10029.90 → 10030.22] need to have
[10030.22 → 10030.82] like track on
[10030.82 → 10031.30] who did it
[10031.30 → 10031.48] I
[10031.48 → 10032.76] that would
[10032.76 → 10033.08] actually be
[10033.08 → 10033.60] kind of sick
[10033.60 → 10034.08] I wonder if
[10034.08 → 10034.76] there was a
[10034.76 → 10035.44] sneaky
[10035.44 → 10036.16] a sneaky
[10036.16 → 10036.72] developer
[10036.72 → 10037.52] in the
[10037.52 → 10038.16] in the
[10038.16 → 10038.56] dashboard
[10038.56 → 10039.20] that thought
[10039.20 → 10039.50] it would be
[10039.50 → 10039.80] funny
[10039.80 → 10041.42] yeah I mean
[10041.42 → 10042.08] if I notice
[10042.08 → 10042.50] something like
[10042.50 → 10042.92] that I'll pull
[10042.92 → 10043.68] them I'll pull
[10043.68 → 10044.08] them out I'll
[10044.08 → 10044.64] pull back the
[10044.64 → 10045.38] shafts
[10045.38 → 10046.72] if that happens
[10046.72 → 10049.04] okay let's
[10049.04 → 10050.06] do I think
[10050.06 → 10050.56] it's funny
[10050.56 → 10052.62] let me do
[10052.62 → 10053.30] my real job
[10053.30 → 10053.60] now
[10053.60 → 10054.94] Linus Luke
[10054.94 → 10055.40] and Dan
[10055.40 → 10055.82] what do you
[10055.82 → 10056.38] see as some
[10056.38 → 10057.18] of the big
[10057.18 → 10057.76] challenges
[10057.76 → 10058.34] LDD and
[10058.34 → 10058.92] float plane in
[10058.92 → 10059.38] the next two
[10059.38 → 10060.12] years what
[10060.12 → 10060.32] are some
[10060.32 → 10060.72] things you're
[10060.72 → 10061.38] excited about
[10061.38 → 10064.50] TV apps
[10064.50 → 10070.44] challenges for
[10070.44 → 10071.24] LTT I
[10071.24 → 10072.26] think I
[10072.26 → 10073.14] think I
[10073.14 → 10073.48] think we
[10073.48 → 10074.16] face the
[10074.16 → 10074.96] same sort
[10074.96 → 10075.68] of macro
[10075.68 → 10076.82] challenges that
[10076.82 → 10077.64] the entire
[10077.64 → 10078.30] rest of the
[10078.30 → 10079.04] tech media
[10079.04 → 10080.22] industry does
[10080.22 → 10081.56] I think that
[10081.56 → 10082.30] a slowing
[10082.30 → 10083.34] pace of
[10083.34 → 10084.20] consumer
[10084.20 → 10085.00] hardware
[10085.00 → 10085.58] development
[10085.58 → 10087.66] is very
[10087.66 → 10088.22] challenging
[10088.22 → 10089.24] and that's
[10089.24 → 10089.74] not to say
[10089.74 → 10090.94] that you
[10090.94 → 10091.34] know the
[10091.34 → 10092.56] the scientists
[10092.56 → 10093.28] and engineers
[10093.28 → 10094.36] that work at
[10094.36 → 10094.90] these companies
[10094.90 → 10096.12] are not doing
[10096.12 → 10097.22] really incredible
[10097.22 → 10099.40] work and you
[10099.40 → 10099.90] know creating
[10099.90 → 10100.80] innovative new
[10100.80 → 10102.10] technologies I
[10102.10 → 10102.64] think it's just
[10102.64 → 10103.52] to say that for
[10103.52 → 10104.32] in a lot of
[10104.32 → 10105.98] categories we've
[10105.98 → 10107.50] sort of reached
[10107.50 → 10108.60] a plateau where
[10108.60 → 10109.42] most people
[10109.42 → 10110.90] mostly don't care
[10110.90 → 10111.68] or can't tell
[10111.68 → 10112.24] the difference
[10112.24 → 10115.12] like TV is I
[10115.12 → 10115.92] think a great
[10115.92 → 10116.98] example of this
[10116.98 → 10119.48] we like I was
[10119.48 → 10120.42] shopping for TVs
[10120.42 → 10121.38] recently if you've
[10121.38 → 10122.16] been if you've
[10122.16 → 10122.82] been watching the
[10122.82 → 10124.08] latest scrapyard
[10124.08 → 10125.46] war series you'll
[10125.46 → 10126.24] know that I was
[10126.24 → 10127.48] at like an
[10127.48 → 10128.76] open box TV
[10128.76 → 10130.44] retailer and as
[10130.44 → 10131.82] much as I love
[10131.82 → 10133.64] a nice TV and I
[10133.64 → 10134.66] have really nice
[10134.66 → 10137.44] TVs in my home I
[10137.44 → 10138.94] was comparing like
[10138.94 → 10140.18] a very
[10140.18 → 10141.82] basic you know
[10141.82 → 10142.90] 70 like you can
[10142.90 → 10143.86] get a gigantic
[10143.86 → 10145.42] 75-inch TV I
[10145.42 → 10147.10] found a deal and
[10147.10 → 10148.16] this is not a
[10148.16 → 10149.12] major spoiler
[10149.12 → 10149.96] because it's just
[10149.96 → 10150.80] a thing that I
[10150.80 → 10151.60] saw in the store
[10151.60 → 10154.02] I found a 75
[10154.02 → 10155.02] inch TV for
[10155.02 → 10156.72] 550 Canadian
[10156.72 → 10157.58] dollars and it
[10157.58 → 10158.32] came with a free
[10158.32 → 10161.20] soundbar so for
[10161.20 → 10162.24] context for my
[10162.24 → 10163.98] American friends
[10163.98 → 10165.38] out there that's
[10165.38 → 10168.72] about 380 US or
[10168.72 → 10170.36] like 370 US or
[10170.36 → 10171.08] something like that
[10171.08 → 10172.16] and it comes with
[10172.16 → 10173.32] a free soundbar
[10173.32 → 10173.90] that was like a
[10173.90 → 10174.70] hundred plus dollar
[10174.70 → 10175.74] value Canadian or
[10175.74 → 10176.34] something like that
[10176.34 → 10176.94] so we're talking
[10176.94 → 10178.42] like a few
[10178.42 → 10179.22] hundred dollars
[10179.22 → 10182.32] for a 75 inch
[10182.32 → 10184.34] TV, and so I'm
[10184.34 → 10185.04] looking at that
[10185.04 → 10185.68] and I'm just kind
[10185.68 → 10188.60] of going well my
[10188.60 → 10191.60] goodness how much
[10191.60 → 10192.56] more how much
[10192.56 → 10193.80] better does
[10193.80 → 10194.64] something have to
[10194.64 → 10196.16] look for me to
[10196.16 → 10197.48] spend three thousand
[10197.48 → 10198.32] dollars on it
[10198.32 → 10200.40] now a freaking
[10200.40 → 10202.98] lot so we've we've
[10202.98 → 10204.60] reached this and
[10204.60 → 10205.56] it looks not bad
[10205.56 → 10206.78] like it didn't
[10206.78 → 10207.70] have great HDR
[10207.70 → 10209.72] but a lot of
[10209.72 → 10210.60] people either don't
[10210.60 → 10212.06] understand or can't
[10212.06 → 10212.82] see the difference
[10212.82 → 10215.24] which is like valid
[10215.24 → 10216.72] you can, it's like
[10216.72 → 10217.62] when a car person
[10217.62 → 10218.48] comes up to you and
[10218.48 → 10219.22] they're like man what
[10219.22 → 10219.58] do you think of
[10219.58 → 10220.40] these new rims and
[10220.40 → 10221.16] you're just like I
[10221.16 → 10221.56] don't know they're
[10221.56 → 10222.26] made of metal I
[10222.26 → 10223.52] guess right but is
[10223.52 → 10224.86] that good right like
[10224.86 → 10227.10] for a lot of people
[10227.10 → 10227.98] right for a lot of
[10227.98 → 10229.36] people just you know
[10229.36 → 10230.70] it's HDR it has more
[10230.70 → 10231.72] colour gamut it means
[10231.72 → 10232.38] it means nothing to
[10232.38 → 10233.02] them they don't care
[10233.02 → 10233.70] they're just they're
[10233.70 → 10235.38] they're watching Fox
[10235.38 → 10236.54] News or CNBC they
[10236.54 → 10237.92] don't it doesn't
[10237.92 → 10241.24] matter right and so
[10241.24 → 10241.92] we've reached this
[10241.92 → 10243.36] point where
[10243.36 → 10244.28] these new developments
[10244.28 → 10246.08] like I saw a
[10246.08 → 10247.64] news article on LG
[10247.64 → 10249.06] apparently has a
[10249.06 → 10250.50] prototype OLED TV that
[10250.50 → 10252.10] uses tandem OLED so
[10252.10 → 10253.56] that's the same tech
[10253.56 → 10254.76] that Apple's using on
[10254.76 → 10256.02] their latest iPads and
[10256.56 → 10258.76] uses two stacked OLED
[10258.76 → 10260.02] layers to achieve much
[10260.82 → 10261.72] much greater brightness
[10261.72 → 10264.04] brightness while
[10264.04 → 10264.58] maintaining inky blacks
[10264.58 → 10264.90] like that blows my
[10264.90 → 10265.70] mind apparently it can
[10265.70 → 10267.08] achieve like 4,000
[10267.08 → 10268.40] nits on this I think
[10268.40 → 10269.18] it was an 83 inch
[10269.18 → 10270.04] display, and I'm sitting
[10270.04 → 10270.70] here going like man
[10270.70 → 10274.80] that's so cool, but it's
[10274.80 → 10276.66] cool past a point that I
[10276.66 → 10278.78] think most people will
[10278.78 → 10280.80] necessarily really care
[10280.80 → 10284.06] about which is a big
[10284.06 → 10285.62] challenge coming back to
[10285.62 → 10287.00] your question for tech
[10287.00 → 10288.78] media because I think
[10288.78 → 10290.72] the pool as the
[10290.72 → 10292.24] mainstream good enough
[10292.24 → 10294.20] cheapo commodity tech
[10294.20 → 10296.54] reaches a point of
[10296.54 → 10297.68] being good enough for
[10297.68 → 10298.64] more and more and more
[10298.64 → 10299.68] and more and more people
[10299.68 → 10302.44] I think the share of
[10302.44 → 10304.16] enthusiasts who care
[10304.16 → 10305.34] about every pixel and
[10305.34 → 10306.02] who care about every
[10306.02 → 10307.50] megahertz is going to be
[10307.50 → 10309.88] reduced the refresh
[10309.88 → 10311.22] cycles on these things
[10311.22 → 10312.48] are also getting more
[10312.48 → 10313.50] and more difficult to
[10313.50 → 10314.58] keep up with annually I
[10314.58 → 10316.10] mean Nvidia used to be
[10316.10 → 10318.10] yearly Apple has been
[10318.10 → 10319.06] yearly on a lot of their
[10319.06 → 10319.74] products they're still
[10319.74 → 10320.96] yearly on the iPhone but
[10320.96 → 10321.72] I don't know if that'll
[10321.72 → 10324.88] last forever like they're
[10324.88 → 10326.06] certainly not yearly on a
[10326.06 → 10326.96] lot of the Mac products
[10326.96 → 10328.04] that they just outright
[10328.04 → 10329.16] don't bother to refresh
[10329.16 → 10329.98] once they have a new
[10329.98 → 10332.78] generation of silicon and
[10332.78 → 10333.78] so there 's's kind of
[10333.78 → 10335.42] less to talk about I think
[10335.42 → 10337.72] that the economic conditions
[10337.72 → 10341.50] right now globally are
[10341.50 → 10343.24] challenging affecting
[10343.24 → 10344.98] people's discretionary
[10344.98 → 10346.48] spending and I don't
[10346.48 → 10348.00] foresee, and I'm not an
[10348.00 → 10349.74] economist, but I don't
[10349.74 → 10352.96] foresee with taxation
[10352.96 → 10354.72] both in the form of
[10354.72 → 10357.48] regular taxation and
[10357.48 → 10359.62] also import taxation
[10359.62 → 10361.36] going up I don't foresee
[10361.36 → 10362.98] that changing anytime soon
[10362.98 → 10365.06] generative AI for all of its
[10365.06 → 10365.98] uselessness and
[10365.98 → 10368.16] hallucination has disrupted
[10368.16 → 10369.54] the job market already
[10369.54 → 10371.14] yeah it is disrupting
[10371.14 → 10373.04] people's livelihoods which
[10373.04 → 10374.10] right now we've been
[10374.10 → 10375.34] saying from the start
[10375.34 → 10377.30] like the companies that
[10377.30 → 10378.42] are really going to kill it
[10378.42 → 10380.26] in my opinion and I
[10380.26 → 10381.24] still think this is true
[10381.24 → 10382.98] are companies that find
[10382.98 → 10384.42] ways to use AI to
[10384.42 → 10385.28] accelerate the people that
[10385.28 → 10387.40] they have and use that to
[10387.40 → 10388.68] grow and bring in more
[10388.68 → 10390.60] not companies that use it
[10390.60 → 10391.28] to just shrink their
[10391.28 → 10393.54] workforce but stock price
[10393.54 → 10396.88] go up win fire person so
[10396.88 → 10397.88] people are just doing it
[10397.88 → 10400.56] anyway and I anyway it's
[10400.56 → 10401.44] it's its frustrating
[10401.44 → 10403.18] because there are
[10403.18 → 10406.02] effective ways for many
[10406.02 → 10407.08] people I'm not going to say
[10407.08 → 10407.90] everyone but for many
[10407.90 → 10409.82] people to use it to
[10409.82 → 10411.46] genuinely help them in
[10411.46 → 10412.58] good ways there's also a
[10412.58 → 10413.50] ton of ways to use it
[10413.50 → 10415.48] improperly but a lot of
[10415.48 → 10417.40] people are scared to
[10417.40 → 10419.80] let it affect their
[10419.80 → 10421.06] productivity in a positive
[10421.06 → 10422.64] way because they don't
[10422.64 → 10424.14] want to contribute towards
[10424.14 → 10425.24] losing their own jobs and
[10425.24 → 10426.60] that's just bad employers in
[10426.60 → 10428.12] my opinion, and it's its
[10428.12 → 10429.60] frustrating that there's like
[10429.60 → 10430.98] any of them at all really
[10430.98 → 10432.44] yeah anyway sorry just
[10432.44 → 10434.50] minor aside and generative
[10434.50 → 10436.28] AI is going to threaten our
[10436.28 → 10437.52] business from other
[10437.52 → 10439.26] vectors as well I mean you
[10439.26 → 10440.46] know we talk about we
[10440.46 → 10441.58] talked earlier about how
[10441.58 → 10444.18] the Nantes article archive
[10444.18 → 10445.86] went offline and one of our
[10445.86 → 10447.44] speculated reasons for it is
[10447.44 → 10450.64] that future PLC who owns
[10450.64 → 10452.12] Nantes and Tom's hardware
[10452.12 → 10453.62] launched a new feature
[10453.62 → 10455.36] allowing you to compare
[10455.36 → 10458.04] products across brands across
[10458.04 → 10461.08] generations, and it's paywalled
[10461.08 → 10465.50] so our theory is that maybe
[10465.50 → 10467.02] they wanted to instead of
[10467.02 → 10468.64] making all of that archival data
[10468.64 → 10469.86] and information available for
[10469.86 → 10471.88] free move it behind the paywall
[10471.88 → 10474.50] where it can be sustainable for
[10474.50 → 10479.26] the future PLC and also to keep
[10479.26 → 10481.14] it away from the prying eyes of
[10481.14 → 10483.42] AI web crawlers that are going to
[10483.42 → 10484.84] scrape all this data and then just
[10484.84 → 10486.94] likes hart it out into a search
[10486.94 → 10489.00] result or into a chatbot that
[10489.00 → 10490.84] doesn't compensate the real
[10490.84 → 10493.16] actual people who really actually
[10493.16 → 10495.26] picked up GPUs and put them into
[10495.26 → 10497.14] benches and tested things
[10497.14 → 10499.78] allowing them to keep their jobs so
[10499.78 → 10501.82] that that's a threat that's a
[10501.82 → 10503.36] threat towards us as well like if
[10503.36 → 10506.20] LTT labs can be scraped and can
[10506.20 → 10507.76] just you know you can search up
[10507.76 → 10509.02] anything about a Corsair power
[10509.02 → 10511.44] supply, and it'll just use our video
[10511.44 → 10513.26] as a source but not compensate us in
[10513.26 → 10514.70] any way that's going to be a real
[10514.70 → 10516.88] challenge for us right we're still
[10516.88 → 10519.68] very committed to doing it but you
[10519.68 → 10521.52] know I would be lying if I didn't
[10521.52 → 10523.04] say that you know building out
[10523.04 → 10524.90] something like the lab has impacted
[10524.90 → 10527.70] our profitability it absolutely has I
[10527.70 → 10531.64] mean doing anything by hand with
[10531.64 → 10534.20] humans building our content the way
[10534.20 → 10535.74] that we continue to do it has
[10535.74 → 10537.34] impacted our profitability over the
[10537.34 → 10540.00] years, so those things are not
[10540.00 → 10541.92] slowing down yeah those things are
[10541.92 → 10543.36] going to continue to be challenges
[10543.36 → 10548.10] it's not all doom and gloom I think
[10548.10 → 10550.86] our team is more locked in than it's
[10550.86 → 10552.50] been in probably a couple of years
[10552.50 → 10556.34] actually, and I don't think I'm the
[10556.34 → 10558.06] only one who's seeing that I've had
[10558.06 → 10559.78] some good conversations with people
[10559.78 → 10562.12] we have some we have some new hire
[10562.12 → 10563.42] starting in the next little bit that
[10563.42 → 10564.86] I'm very excited about on the writing
[10564.86 → 10567.10] side I'm really excited about the
[10567.10 → 10569.00] direction the lab is going under Luke's
[10569.00 → 10573.00] leadership I yeah I think we're I
[10573.00 → 10574.76] think we're firing on more cylinders
[10574.76 → 10577.84] I am hopeful that while we might
[10577.84 → 10580.02] not you know be back to a cadence of six
[10580.02 → 10581.76] uploads a week I'm hopeful we can get to
[10581.76 → 10583.56] a more regular upload schedule again
[10583.56 → 10585.62] relatively soon I think that's something
[10585.62 → 10588.56] that would be good for our viewers and
[10588.56 → 10591.10] also good for our company's ongoing
[10591.10 → 10596.38] viability yeah the future is looking up
[10596.38 → 10600.62] but that doesn't mean that we can ignore
[10600.62 → 10602.54] the headwinds that are coming our way
[10602.54 → 10604.52] and coming everyone's way realistically
[10604.52 → 10611.78] hey LLD just got my allay battery
[10611.78 → 10613.44] upgraded after your video for the
[10613.44 → 10616.44] SAX upgrade kit SO I think SO
[10616.44 → 10619.60] upgrade kit and loving it Linus would
[10619.60 → 10621.54] you consider any further modifications to
[10621.54 → 10623.54] your ally in the future maybe RAM thanks
[10623.54 → 10626.08] I don't think I need more RAM I've never
[10626.08 → 10628.08] run into a game on my ally I mean I
[10628.08 → 10630.44] mostly just play tape I have over
[10630.44 → 10633.50] 300 hours in tape to tape now it's
[10633.50 → 10635.72] amazing how quickly they add up when like
[10635.72 → 10638.64] my wind down before bed is to lie in bed
[10638.64 → 10641.52] and play a run if there's a decent amount
[10641.52 → 10644.04] of idle time to you know I've ever loaded
[10644.04 → 10646.86] up yeah take the tape actually logs your
[10646.86 → 10648.98] on ice time, so I think I'm at like a
[10648.98 → 10650.48] hundred and seventy hours or something
[10650.48 → 10652.12] up on ice time makes a bit more so that's
[10652.12 → 10654.88] still a lot so that's the game I
[10654.88 → 10658.80] primarily play on my ally and don't need
[10658.80 → 10661.30] more RAM for it but definitely enjoying the
[10661.30 → 10663.54] battery life upgrade it's just like we
[10663.54 → 10665.74] saw when ASUS went from the ally one to
[10665.74 → 10669.10] the ally two for some reason the battery
[10669.10 → 10672.08] life benefit is more than just the like
[10672.08 → 10675.70] watt-hours increase I don't I don't I
[10675.70 → 10677.78] someone's going to have to math that for me
[10677.78 → 10679.26] because I don't I don't quite get it but
[10679.26 → 10682.06] I'm into it, so I've been enjoying the
[10682.06 → 10684.46] absolute heck out of it I would love to
[10684.46 → 10686.24] have a bigger SSD in it, I'd love to just
[10686.24 → 10689.58] have you know entire libraries of Linux ISO
[10689.58 → 10693.26] older more pixelated Linux ISOs that
[10693.26 → 10696.50] are just kind of on tap but beyond that
[10696.50 → 10699.76] no I love if it's been very, very good to
[10699.76 → 10704.52] me, and I am excited about the Xbox One but
[10704.52 → 10707.58] I don't know I might be more excited for
[10707.58 → 10710.58] potentially a Steam Deck 2 I need it to be
[10710.58 → 10712.62] I need it to be competitive on GPU power
[10712.62 → 10714.90] though like the Steam Deck was kind of it
[10714.90 → 10717.52] fell behind really fast, and you know me I
[10717.52 → 10720.24] I like cutting-edge performance I and on
[10720.24 → 10725.42] handheld every 10% is noticeable when
[10725.42 → 10731.42] you're at 32 FPS the jump to 35 it's like I
[10731.42 → 10733.80] want that here 's's another spicy one to
[10733.80 → 10735.36] add in on the whole Windows Linux thing
[10735.36 → 10739.50] yeah this is why I haven't this is a
[10739.50 → 10740.86] major reason why I haven't bought a
[10740.86 → 10743.58] gaming handheld is because I kind of
[10743.58 → 10747.02] didn't really get in on Steam Deck early
[10747.02 → 10750.20] enough mmm feels like I'm kind of in
[10750.20 → 10752.86] Steam Deck 2 waiting room yeah okay and
[10752.86 → 10755.34] I'm looking at taking a minute to yeah to
[10755.34 → 10757.80] get around to that I'm all good yeah but
[10758.60 → 10761.98] I'm looking at the alternatives and the
[10761.98 → 10763.54] the big push right now is Windows based
[10763.54 → 10766.12] alternatives, and I'm like yeah I want to
[10766.12 → 10771.52] support the Linux push I just if I'm
[10771.52 → 10774.44] going to be voting with my wallet right like I'm
[10774.44 → 10777.94] tired of the garbage that has been
[10777.94 → 10779.76] shovelled into my face from Windows from so
[10779.76 → 10781.96] for so long I'm pissed that there's no
[10781.96 → 10783.48] alternative I'm pissed that there isn't
[10783.48 → 10785.92] like a Windows premium where I don't get
[10785.92 → 10788.26] trashed on with ads and other stuff like
[10788.26 → 10790.30] that I'm pissed that I can't get away from
[10790.30 → 10791.80] certain telemetry things without
[10791.80 → 10795.28] registry jumping and whatnot and then
[10795.28 → 10797.50] having to redo that because Windows
[10797.50 → 10800.06] update just decides to like to change things
[10800.06 → 10803.34] or whatever so it's I'm trying to get out
[10803.34 → 10805.42] so I'm not gonna financially back a thing
[10805.42 → 10808.14] that I'm trying to get out of, so I'll
[10808.14 → 10810.92] wait for Steam Deck 2 that's fair is what
[10810.92 → 10815.72] it is all right hit me Dan hi LDL instead
[10815.72 → 10818.24] of glazed AI interactions causing users to
[10818.24 → 10819.98] expect other people to act like their
[10819.98 → 10822.62] chatbots do doesn't it also seem likely
[10822.62 → 10825.14] that these users will also start to act
[10825.14 → 10828.46] like their chatbots' no I don't think, so I
[10828.46 → 10831.78] think being glazed is not necessarily
[10831.78 → 10835.50] going to make you become a glazer no I
[10835.50 → 10836.96] honestly think it'll largely do the
[10836.96 → 10837.62] opposite effect
[10837.62 → 10843.76] especially when you don't glaze back and
[10843.76 → 10845.60] it keeps glazing you yeah like let's let's
[10845.60 → 10848.14] think about sort of like a
[10848.14 → 10850.68] parallel like I often talk about how I
[10850.68 → 10854.70] think that it is like influencers and famous
[10854.70 → 10857.88] people are sort of uniquely vulnerable to
[10857.88 → 10861.84] giving into narcissistic tendencies because
[10861.84 → 10868.12] I think that anyone would struggle to
[10868.12 → 10870.00] stay grounded when they're surrounded by
[10870.00 → 10872.52] hundreds thousands or millions of people
[10872.52 → 10874.52] that are telling them how incredible they
[10874.52 → 10877.32] are all day every day well riddle me this
[10877.32 → 10883.20] these professional being glaziers are they
[10883.20 → 10886.66] generally known for being like the super
[10886.66 → 10889.02] most amenable people in the world like as a
[10889.02 → 10890.88] group I'm not saying there aren't nice
[10890.88 → 10892.28] celebrities the opposite you're used to
[10892.28 → 10899.28] getting catered to yeah, and I'm sure you you you know you let it slip here or there, and you don't
[10899.28 → 10901.04] communicate with the eye nicely, and you notice
[10901.04 → 10904.50] that it keeps glazing you, so there's no there's no incentive there's no reward
[10904.50 → 10920.66] loop yeah there's no penalty a non jerk yeah this interface is broken in a way that I'm not really sure how to deal with, so I click this it asks me really, and then I can't interact with it
[10920.66 → 10950.64] weird um I haven't had any of those problems let me go look cool do you want another one while we wait yeah hit me hey wan.dll with everything being so software and driver focused do you think there will become microtransactions or DLC for graphics cards oh man we didn't talk about it because I just had enough bad news last week, but you saw that um
[10950.64 → 10961.26] who was it who was it Volkswagen is adding uh like a pay for a subscription for more performance to their car or whatever it was you don't click on the really you just click on the button again
[10961.26 → 10977.64] oh not the most intuitive neat okay uh VW uh performance subscription I think it was yeah that's brand-new right I think that was yeah VW introduces monthly subscription to increase car power eight days ago
[10977.64 → 10986.98] I just I had enough talking about bad news last week, so I just didn't feel like it yeah but here it is the optional power upgrade will cost
[10986.98 → 10999.58] 1650 a month or 165 pounds annually with that said this also made me far less upset it is not outlandish
[10999.58 → 11029.32] hold on hold on hold on I'm going to defend this it is not outlandish to charge more for a higher performance model and in this case I know the exact same hardware is in there, but you could make the argument that there might be a higher likelihood of long-term damage to the vehicle if it is somehow being pushed harder and there could be some cost there I don't know that they've actually done the math you know correctly I'm sure there's margin in it
[11029.32 → 11042.94] but as long as there's a lifetime subscription I will be far less upset about a month or as long as there's a lifetime purchase option I'll be far less upset about a subscription being offered
[11042.94 → 11048.36] steak boy and float point chat brought up an amazing comparable yes what if this was a driver for a graphics card
[11048.36 → 11058.28] as long as there is a lifetime subscription so now you have to buy your graphics card and pay for a subscription to the drivers
[11058.28 → 11073.44] to get it to be slightly faster to be clear you can still drive it with all I'm not saying I'm okay with it, I'm saying I'm a lot more okay with it if there is a lifetime purchase option I'll give you an example in the hardware world that's very much like this
[11073.44 → 11085.04] should lifetime purchase come with the product you bought the car so squadron is literally a g-force card that has a lifetime subscription in this case that costs a lot of money
[11085.04 → 11097.36] to drivers that are certified and to the expectation that it is going to be driven harder because it's going to be used hour in hour out day after day in a professional environment
[11097.36 → 11100.74] I care a lot less when it's a professional product though we're not talking about professional products
[11100.74 → 11104.12] and that's fair enough and that's fair enough I'm just saying that the parallel
[11104.12 → 11108.10] not saying not, not trying to insult the clearly very professional car
[11108.10 → 11117.38] yeah yeah I just mean I just mean we already have very clear parallels in the hardware industry this thing's going to be in the user space
[11117.38 → 11124.30] okay fair enough I'm just saying it's its a thing that exists and that I have been upset about
[11124.30 → 11130.58] like I have been upset about the exact same bloody bunch of times the exact same silicon
[11130.58 → 11146.02] right being locked down in this way I find it I find it very frustrating, but I also do recognize that in the case of squadron or in the case of this there could be additional costs
[11146.02 → 11153.86] so let me here let me put it this way LTT screwdriver right if there was a professional version of this
[11153.86 → 11166.66] that included I don't know let's say once every two years you can mail it to us, and we'll like to disassemble it and lube it and polish it for free or something
[11166.66 → 11174.72] like if there's some kind of additional work of some sort that we're doing so what I'm saying is I don't know the math
[11174.72 → 11178.96] I don't know the math on how many more failures they'll have for pushing it that much harder
[11178.96 → 11189.54] but there may be some math there and I, and they're insuring it I would assume it is covered under warranty to have it at this higher performance level
[11189.54 → 11199.18] how long is your warranty though not that far on most cars yeah so I look I'm not saying it's great I'm not saying I love it
[11199.18 → 11205.34] I'm saying as long as there is a lifetime option let's make the car cost a thousand dollars more
[11205.34 → 11211.52] well sure, but that's exactly what they did they made it cost 649 pounds more, and I think from a
[11211.52 → 11215.66] percentage standpoint like if it's a hundred thousand dollar car, and they're charging me 650
[11215.66 → 11220.42] dollars I'm going to be like why are you nickel and dining me if it's a thousand-dollar car and
[11220.42 → 11226.20] they're charging me 650 bucks that percentage point makes it more understandable I think I'm just viewing it
[11226.20 → 11231.26] the same thing in the same way but with a different lens if that kind of makes sense where like
[11231.26 → 11237.18] the fact that the monthly one exists is what bothers me I understand that it makes it more okay
[11237.18 → 11242.30] like you see what I mean yeah it makes it more okay to you that the lifetime exists for me, it makes
[11242.30 → 11247.42] it less okay that the monthly exists its kind of the same thing I don't like either of them it's glass half full
[11247.42 → 11255.58] glass uh you know I mean Walker here says it's not uncommon to pay for tuning a vehicle that increases
[11255.58 → 11261.42] the horsepower without any hardware change yeah it's just a one-time cost and so is this well
[11261.42 → 11266.88] unless you buy the subscription I just don't like the subscription exists I don't like that the
[11266.88 → 11272.46] subscription exists either but if people choose a subscription when they have a lifetime option
[11272.46 → 11280.60] they have to own at least some of the responsibility for the vastly larger amount of money they will pay
[11280.60 → 11288.20] over the lifetime they own this purchase okay what about Nvidia one cent per month per Curator
[11291.96 → 11296.92] again I don't I don't love it I don't want it you're going to have to you're going to have to
[11296.92 → 11302.84] graphics cards okay super subsidized if Nvidia okay so here you know what let's draw a consumer parallel
[11302.84 → 11312.52] that I actually would be okay with oh no if Nvidia gave me another 200 watts on the 5090 full warranty
[11313.40 → 11319.48] everything's covered, and they were like yeah it's another you know okay so what's this in the context
[11319.48 → 11325.72] of a vehicle so they're charging 600 let's say what this is a 30 000 vehicle something like that 50 maybe 60
[11325.72 → 11330.52] you think it's that much I don't know it's just a second I don't know what cars cost oh my god it's
[11330.52 → 11337.64] it's the like limit breaker subscription yeah, and it's effectively just a warranty effectively
[11337.64 → 11346.76] just an overclocking warranty if they let you do it without that, but you lost your warranty yeah I think
[11346.76 → 11354.44] I'd be more cool with it that was pounds right yeah 40 000 pounds 40 000 pounds so we're talking
[11354.44 → 11359.48] because that's literally just a warranty at that point so call it 50 000. So we're talking in this
[11359.48 → 11369.24] case about 1.5 percent of the cost so if Nvidia said okay on your two thousand dollar GPU uh it's 20
[11369.24 → 11376.68] it's 30 bucks, and you can have another a month no, no no total lifetime it's 30 bucks and you
[11376.68 → 11383.24] can have another 100 watts or 200 watts, or you know whatever if you could is you could do it anyway
[11383.24 → 11387.80] I mean didn't have a warranty okay I'm slamming that button I'm doing that this totally this
[11387.80 → 11393.80] totally even exists people buy this all the time this is the OC variant oh yeah yeah this is the OC
[11393.80 → 11397.16] variant that's well cars, and you don't even get additional power limit cars have trim levels
[11397.88 → 11403.00] well so see the car levels though that's a tough one well no they're they're doing what the graphics
[11403.00 → 11409.08] cards do you can get the OC car, or you can get the normal car they're just doing that in the same car
[11409.08 → 11414.04] I think we're going I think we're going too far with this because we're just we're now just describing
[11415.24 → 11420.92] an extended warranty well sort of it's not a's not a warranty level it's a yeah it's a different
[11420.92 → 11427.64] tier of product and I've made the argument since forever that you should never buy the OC
[11428.52 → 11435.32] lesser card when the not OC better card is now so close in price
[11435.32 → 11442.84] but I mean the difference between a 5080 and a 5090 is now a thousand dollars so if OC 5080 could
[11442.84 → 11449.32] make sense and in the case of the 5090 there is nothing higher so if you want any more if they
[11449.32 → 11454.04] were to come to me and say yeah it's an extra 30 bucks or 50 bucks for the OC variant that runs a
[11454.04 → 11457.16] little faster we've been done a little better we made sure it's going to work, and we're going to cover
[11457.16 → 11462.76] that I don't see that as an extended warranty I see that as an ever so slightly faster product the
[11462.76 → 11465.80] reason why I'm saying extended warranty is because if you could just do it yourself
[11466.44 → 11471.40] yeah and that's what happens when they're the same product as you can take a car and put a bigger
[11471.40 → 11476.20] engine in it, but the manufacturer also produces that same model of car that has the bigger engine
[11476.20 → 11483.88] in it already but this VW is just both of those cars in one car like it's a 5080 and a 5090 in a
[11483.88 → 11489.48] single card, and then you just pay the extra thousand dollars, and now it's a 5090 instead of a 58 yeah in
[11489.48 → 11494.28] this case the difference in performance is pretty small though so I feel a lot less like they're
[11494.28 → 11499.88] totally sandbagging me of course like they could have just afforded to give me you know a car
[11499.88 → 11505.88] that performs twice as good well this sucks it's not a different car um yeah, but this is just the same
[11505.88 → 11512.28] car it's just slightly more tuned and I think yeah i I hope I'm not just going to completely end up
[11512.28 → 11517.88] cancelled over this again because magnetics says Linus's point about accelerated wear profiles is a
[11517.88 → 11524.04] decent one when something is worked harder there could be additional wear and the reason that i
[11524.04 → 11528.36] went to that first is because we were talking specifically about batteries and electric
[11528.36 → 11532.76] modes it's an EV right that is so important your argument makes complete sense and is totally fair
[11532.76 → 11539.80] and totally fine the problem is it will immediately be abused well immediately, and unquestionably it's
[11539.80 → 11545.64] it's the future problem because now you pull back more and pull back more and pull back more
[11545.64 → 11551.00] and paywall more and paywall more and paywall more yeah like heated seats it's not the like base
[11551.00 → 11557.16] concept is the fine I guess that you're describing it's its what will companies do it yeah I feel
[11557.16 → 11564.20] better about this than the BMW heated seats personally yeah you know what I think I do too because the
[11564.20 → 11571.24] heated seats that's literally in their like it's its literally so inexpensive for you to implement it
[11571.24 → 11575.88] that you can literally put it in every single vehicle that rolls down the line and becomes cheaper
[11575.88 → 11583.24] because you do that yes less skew um but even then it's the same cost blending right so the people who
[11583.24 → 11590.12] pay for it are subsidizing the people who don't pay for it to put it into every vehicle um i still
[11590.12 → 11596.28] don't like it I can still not like it in this case i actually yeah I agree with you Dan I don't mind this as
[11596.28 → 11602.68] much as the heated seat activation no I think one percent feels bad if it was 25 percent like if the
[11602.68 → 11611.32] 50 50 to 50 90 upgrade was a thousand dollars and the card was 500 bucks that feels more okay in a way
[11612.60 → 11616.60] this feels nickel and dime but I know what you're talking about especially on electric so yeah
[11617.24 → 11622.28] sucks it feels welcome to current year though yeah it's bad it's its not good for the world step is
[11622.28 → 11628.04] not that bad so you don't look at it that closely slippy slope yeah bag says with your experience
[11628.04 → 11633.32] with team viewer I think you would trust lifetime subs less especially in this corporate environment
[11633.32 → 11640.12] you are 100 right in this case though um they would have to actively brick it whereas team viewers
[11640.12 → 11646.44] service runs through their servers I don't see any reason why my additional horsepower would have to
[11646.44 → 11650.52] do an authentication check every time I turn on the car until it does that were the case
[11650.52 → 11655.64] mm-hmm well then that's where Luke's slippery slope argument which as you know fallacious as a
[11655.64 → 11660.20] or fallacy or whatever as invalid as a slippery slope argument might be
[11661.40 → 11667.40] also you know at a certain point we've seen it happen enough times that we kind of have to go okay
[11667.40 → 11671.88] slippery slopes are valid, and then slippery slopes are absolutely when you sell the car it
[11671.88 → 11676.92] doesn't transfer, so the new person also has to buy it is that true for this one no I'm just I'm just
[11676.92 → 11680.84] giving them ideas, but that is absolutely something they would do i I find slippery slopes to be
[11681.88 → 11687.64] completely valid in these types of conversations right less valid when it comes to a specific like
[11687.64 → 11693.80] and in between two individuals that know each other type situation sure um because at that point
[11693.80 → 11698.68] in time you can be like you can trust me to not slippery slope this and that's a valid argument so then you
[11698.68 → 11702.76] can counter but in these types of situations it's like the company's massive
[11702.76 → 11709.16] entire reason to exist incentive is to slippery slope this so it's like you should almost trust
[11709.16 → 11714.12] them to do so more than uh anything else, so crystal points out this is also the same
[11714.12 → 11720.60] hardware just like the heated seats, but it's the wear profile yeah that's the difference and yeah you
[11720.60 → 11727.08] know they validate it the validation is not a joke right they validated it at a certain performance
[11727.08 → 11733.00] level now they've validated it at another performance level there may be a maintenance or
[11733.00 → 11737.64] wear cost there it's harder on the batteries it's harder on the batteries it's harder on the motors
[11739.64 → 11746.52] uh okay I want to hit me hello bad cholesterol LDL what punishment are you three willing to commit to
[11746.52 → 11752.04] for the first person to break the wan streak love the content shave Luke's head please yes I also say
[11752.04 → 11757.48] we shave Luke's head if anybody misses I mean what if anybody misses that's a great suggestion i
[11757.48 → 11763.32] appreciate that i I second it actually yeah there we go all right settled moving on that's ridiculous
[11764.76 → 11769.88] oh my goodness um what are we willing to commit I mean it's not going to be me so I don't care
[11770.60 → 11778.04] yeah honestly we needed nothing to be insanely die hard about this already so we may have actually
[11778.04 → 11784.60] had this conversation before maybe it's been so long we forgot I think there may be a consequence
[11784.60 → 11789.32] i I think i just I think we might just not remember what it is do any viewers remember I still like
[11789.32 → 11793.88] that we have to shave Luke's head but none of us are going to be the one who is going to allow that
[11793.88 → 11800.52] to happen oh yeah the pride of not losing is worth more than me shaving my head yeah absolutely 100
[11800.52 → 11806.76] I don't want you to have to shave your head that'd be fine dunk again I thought I was going to be
[11806.76 → 11811.88] balled my like whole life into my 20s and then I finally realized that that's not how that works
[11811.88 → 11817.00] flow plane shot doesn't recall any punishments maybe I'm just imagining it I mean that's possible
[11817.56 → 11820.76] I think we might have had the conversation, but maybe it never turned into anything
[11822.36 → 11827.40] loser has to do when show in full Blue Man Group makeup I mean we would just do that anyway that'd be
[11827.40 → 11828.84] hilarious yeah that sounds fun it's more of a
[11832.12 → 11833.88] the pride thing um
[11835.56 → 11845.32] Ivan would actually kill me if I shaved my head well it's Luke's head right okay, okay so if anyone
[11845.32 → 11849.96] breaks the streak we shave Luke's head okay all in favour
[11849.96 → 11851.96] oh
[11851.96 → 11852.28] oh
[11852.28 → 11852.76] you're right
[11852.76 → 11853.88] it's not
[11853.88 → 11854.60] it's on camera
[11854.60 → 11855.72] it's on camera
[11855.72 → 11856.20] no
[11856.20 → 11857.40] the motion passes
[11857.40 → 11857.96] no
[11857.96 → 11859.00] no that's not how that works
[11859.00 → 11860.36] there's no bakeries backsides
[11860.36 → 11864.68] that's not how that works I'm I'm actually completely okay with that being mine but I feel like
[11866.28 → 11870.76] we'll talk about it another time we'll figure something out you know it doesn't make sense that
[11870.76 → 11875.08] if Linus doesn't show up then I have to shave my head I mean yeah but then Linus loses
[11875.08 → 11881.00] me and apparently you I mean you raised your hand no, no all right hit me up hit me down
[11881.00 → 11883.32] you can take Luke's 2.5 pound weights
[11885.72 → 11891.24] that would be more annoying for little man than me at this point hello from the East Coast
[11891.24 → 11898.36] question for Luke and also Linus in parentheses as the infra team grows are there any plans for
[11898.36 → 11904.12] its admin focused content a day in the life of your infra team network deep drives etc
[11905.64 → 11913.16] probably not cool good chat boring yeah hey six foot two six foot one and allegedly 5.6 i
[11913.16 → 11919.40] actually go by five foot 14. Uh are there any examples of products with really anti-consumer
[11919.40 → 11926.12] behaviour that you would refuse to review on for example action cams requiring mobile apps to
[11926.12 → 11933.56] initialize no I mean I think our job is to call these things out is to shine a light on
[11934.92 → 11943.08] on a bad practice or a bad product I think refusing to review it is in a way even passively
[11943.08 → 11949.80] contributing to the problem it's like when people with ethics and integrity resign their post uh when
[11949.80 → 11957.32] they're asked to do something um by a superior and then yeah they just put someone in who would
[11957.32 → 11963.80] happily do it yeah so they keep their ethics, and they keep their integrity um but by resigning they
[11963.80 → 11970.52] clear the way for someone to just do it anyway we haven't actually accomplished anything here I think
[11970.52 → 11977.32] in the past when as a society it felt like we had some shame um I definitely admired that more because it
[11977.32 → 11982.12] would bring more of a spotlight to it and then changes initialized and that person who asked for
[11982.12 → 11987.48] the thing might get removed, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore in modern years so um so it
[11987.48 → 11993.56] seems like there needs to be a new meta and my meta is definitely if is something's interesting
[11993.56 → 11997.72] enough to make a video I don't care how anti-consumer it is let's make a video about it and talk about
[11997.72 → 12007.00] how much they suck hey LL and d have you heard about the Final Fantasy 14 drama this week square
[12007.00 → 12012.44] Unix issued a cease and desist over an add-on that let players share custom character mods do you think
[12012.44 → 12018.92] this ties into payment processor censorship I mean uh are were the custom character mods
[12019.80 → 12025.56] quite X-rated is that what we're talking about I didn't think that it was a problem until you mentioned
[12025.56 → 12031.32] the payment processors and now I'm concerned again I don't think that's related to it add-ons weren't
[12031.32 → 12037.48] allowed in Final Fantasy 14 already as far as my understanding goes um and customer cut a customer
[12037.48 → 12044.60] character models custom character models could be uh perceived as cheating and the accounts um i
[12044.60 → 12049.72] yeah I can't find anything about triple x character mods I don't think you're allowed any add-ons in that game
[12049.72 → 12061.80] so yeah yeah a couple more hey LLD does Linus have any updates from the smart door lock he recently
[12061.80 → 12067.24] installed is there a smart home device or feature that you wish existed but is not currently available
[12067.24 → 12071.80] thanks I mean basically anything is currently available if you're willing to pay for like a
[12071.80 → 12078.68] professional installer to come and do some wizardry for you like uh I think it's one of uh yeah it's one
[12078.68 → 12085.08] of Yvonne's old high school friends husband's friend who does like installs for these like
[12085.08 → 12089.80] crazy homes and like haughty and stuff like that, and he was telling me about this custom mount
[12089.80 → 12096.04] for this TV that would like to go up into the ceiling and like hide itself so it can like to come down and
[12096.04 → 12101.88] and be like just suspended in the middle of the living room so that the um so that the mom can like
[12102.44 → 12108.60] watch TV while she's cooking in the kitchen like across the open concept thing anyway you I think
[12108.60 → 12114.12] think you can basically do anything um as for the smart lock I'm really happy with it, I can give
[12114.12 → 12121.00] people codes one-time use or timed um they can access whatever I need them to whenever I need them
[12121.00 → 12127.16] to it locks on its own which sometimes I'm a bit of a scatterbrain and I forget to you know do that so
[12127.16 → 12134.84] that's really nice so it's always locked um and works perfectly and the charging solution is working
[12134.84 → 12140.84] perfectly I have wireless charging for my smart lock, so there's just a little base station that
[12140.84 → 12148.04] sits on just a little like end table thing in the foyer, and it just beams power wirelessly to my lock
[12148.04 → 12153.56] so I never have to change the battery in it ever again oh cool yeah that's actually pretty sick
[12153.56 → 12160.52] cool wow that's sweet because wiring those up can kind of suck yeah oh my gosh so most people run a
[12160.52 → 12168.28] battery hey when I have a question for Luke about the labs' website I yes notice it's really fast with
[12168.28 → 12174.28] a lot of cool web tech thank you I was curious what framework you guys use they have done how difficult
[12174.28 → 12180.12] Firefox has been uh magnetics I made a video on that it's on short circuit they've done a wonderful job
[12180.12 → 12185.96] with keeping it very performant um and I just got to get more people to go to it um but I wanted to
[12185.96 → 12191.32] show off I like this one I think there are a bunch of different ones I haven't tried them all this is
[12191.32 → 12196.20] not a like particular endorsement other than financial advice yep other than that these tools
[12196.20 → 12200.36] are cool you might find one that you prefer more it's very likely haven't even tried it uh I started
[12200.36 → 12204.68] using this many years ago, and it's been awesome ever since, but it's called built with or built with
[12204.68 → 12211.56] dot com, and you can just look up any website so i just I went to their home page just went ldglabs.com
[12212.20 → 12216.76] and then clicked look up, and then you can look at basically all the stuff that we use you can see
[12216.76 → 12223.80] our analytics we like plausible because it's uh friendlier to users in my opinion uh and in Dan
[12223.80 → 12229.08] Siegel's opinion who is the one who suggested it for that reason um you can see that we have Next.js
[12229.08 → 12233.80] which is probably more related to your question along with react which is maybe even more related
[12233.80 → 12238.76] to your question along with oversell which is definitely likely definitely related to your question
[12239.40 → 12244.52] but you can do this for any website, and it will poke through and help you find different things
[12244.52 → 12249.48] about if it's a very fun thing to do um to just see kind of like what are these guys doing how did they
[12249.48 → 12256.28] build stuff you know I really don't think AWS is going to catch on because the future is serverless
[12256.28 → 12271.80] sorry that's my favourite joke last one I've got for you today hi LLD uh you guys talk about lifetime
[12271.80 → 12276.84] purchases would you ever consider doing a lifetime float plane subscription the other thing we talk
[12276.84 → 12289.48] about endlessly is sustainable business practices unfortunately float plane is a service that has a very real uh
[12289.48 → 12299.48] uh very ongoing monthly cost yeah so if we were to offer you a lifetime subscription what we'd be offering you
[12299.48 → 12310.12] is a lie because at some point unless we grow infinitely and infinite growth on a finite planet is unfortunately not possible
[12310.12 → 12324.12] unless we grow infinitely at some point the pyramid will collapse and the new user recruitment will not cover the cost of continuing to support the legacy lifetime users and the whole thing falls down
[12324.12 → 12331.96] falls down, and we have to go back on our word so we want to just put ourselves in a position where we never have to go back on our word
[12331.96 → 12339.24] it's also like I don't know in my opinion yes I think there's an argument that could be made that flow plane has
[12339.24 → 12350.76] flow plane itself has well depends on the user um a lioness media group account on flow plane has DRM free downloads
[12350.76 → 12355.16] uh it's its it's up to the creators if they want them or not so i I can't say it for the whole platform
[12355.16 → 12363.88] um you could make an argument that that's your like legacy of the thing but in my opinion you you you're not
[12363.88 → 12372.84] I can't give you flow plane right yeah you can take the downloads but if you buy a lifetime subscription and then
[12372.84 → 12381.24] eventually full plane dies uh you and I are 90, and we finally retire and flow plane dies for whatever
[12381.24 → 12391.24] reason um, and you can't access the website anymore what is your lifetime subscription for yeah if is i
[12391.24 → 12398.04] could if we happened is team viewer just went away eventually, but you could keep using it because you
[12398.04 → 12403.96] have your whatever thing, and then it doesn't lifetime is real, but lifetime is fine yeah because
[12403.96 → 12408.12] okay it stopped iterating at some point that kind of sucks sure whatever, but you can still use the
[12408.12 → 12413.80] thing then lifetime is applicable in my opinion I can't just give you full plane forever so
[12413.80 → 12419.80] in my opinion is not really applicable Tim uh asks in float plane chat why not just make it like
[12419.80 → 12427.80] fifteen hundred dollars how does that not make sense because it doesn't make sense for you yeah i i i i i
[12427.80 → 12437.56] like to stack w's in every transaction I am looking for a way to build a balanced I offer
[12438.12 → 12447.40] I receive sheet right, and you know from my point of view um finding the correct number for float plane
[12447.40 → 12454.60] lifetime subscription is asking me to have a crystal ball I would have to know exactly how much value you're
[12454.60 → 12459.48] going to receive and I'm going to have to know exactly to a reasonable degree of accuracy how
[12459.48 → 12465.24] much it's going to cost me I can't know that so it's far better for me to just have a sustainable
[12465.24 → 12470.20] billing model that works for me and if it works for you then that's great you can subscribe and if it's
[12470.20 → 12475.08] not working for you any more then you can not subscribe and if you want to throw money at us as much as this
[12475.08 → 12480.36] doesn't benefit like my department I don't think that's a good way to look at things personally
[12480.36 → 12486.60] um the same reason why we have merch messages instead of using other potential systems is
[12486.60 → 12492.04] because we're trying to give you more back for this exchange that's happening so go get something from
[12492.04 → 12498.52] the store yeah pick up something on LTT store or come to whale land if you really don't want anything
[12498.52 → 12503.72] if you must just give us money you can like to buy a gift card and then just like never use it yeah
[12503.72 → 12509.00] technically that does sit on our books as like an outstanding liability or whatever because gift cards
[12509.00 → 12513.88] legally in Canada can't expire um are gift cards on the store attached to your account I don't
[12513.88 → 12519.08] remember is it actually a code I don't know I don't remember I don't remember, but the point is just
[12519.08 → 12524.84] like look that if you want to give us more money you absolutely can, but we don't want to charge more
[12524.84 → 12529.64] for it so you're going to have to find your own creative way to do that yeah which there are sure
[12530.44 → 12537.32] you get our office is on Google Maps you could show up and slip a undo under the door I can't stop you
[12539.00 → 12549.56] my g-sting's ready oh my god and that's it for the show we will see you guys again next week same
[12549.56 → 12558.20] bad time same bad channel bye whoa you did it before I wave yeah I think you yeah the wave started the
[12558.20 → 12566.04] wave started I'm allowing it all right its touch and go through sorry oh my trigger-happy
