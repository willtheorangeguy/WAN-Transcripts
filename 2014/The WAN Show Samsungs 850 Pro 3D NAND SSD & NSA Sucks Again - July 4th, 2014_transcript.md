[0.00 --> 0.92]  Windows 9.
[1.66 --> 3.50]  Windows 9. Windows no!
[3.80 --> 4.52]  Windows 9!
[4.66 --> 5.30]  Windows 9!
[5.36 --> 5.58]  Nein!
[7.14 --> 10.00]  Does that mean that, like, they're...
[11.06 --> 13.02]  That's the directive internally?
[13.38 --> 15.44]  Is that they can't do anything stupid?
[15.60 --> 17.24]  If someone comes up with a suggestion, it's like,
[17.30 --> 17.50]  Nein!
[18.76 --> 19.28]  No!
[20.66 --> 21.70]  It must be good.
[22.04 --> 23.08]  We want to take out the startman.
[23.12 --> 23.42]  Nein!
[26.42 --> 27.48]  That would be awesome.
[27.48 --> 30.32]  We want to limit DirectX compatibility to just the Nein!
[31.68 --> 33.08]  That actually kind of works.
[33.68 --> 35.44]  That was awesome.
[35.92 --> 37.20]  I really liked that one.
[37.34 --> 38.54]  Welcome to the show, guys.
[38.70 --> 40.12]  It's the WAN Show time again.
[40.32 --> 45.16]  It's Friday, and it's been a hell of a couple weeks, actually.
[45.32 --> 45.60]  Yeah, it has.
[45.72 --> 47.28]  I figured it out last night.
[47.34 --> 51.62]  I was like, why am I so far behind on all of my work?
[51.98 --> 54.88]  It's like, wait, because we did a lot of stuff.
[54.88 --> 62.94]  In the last 10 business days, I have spent four of them in the office.
[64.30 --> 64.74]  Okay?
[65.08 --> 65.88]  Because I was at...
[65.88 --> 66.74]  Four and a half.
[67.04 --> 69.84]  Because I was at Highlander Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday last week,
[69.88 --> 73.56]  and I dragged my tired ass into the office for Wednesday afternoon
[73.56 --> 74.90]  and, like, wrote a script.
[75.02 --> 77.84]  And I was like, zombie scripting.
[77.84 --> 81.84]  And then I had Thursday before it was Friday,
[82.58 --> 85.54]  where I go to NCIX and then do WAN Show, so it's a total write-off.
[85.92 --> 88.72]  And then I came in this week, worked Monday.
[89.46 --> 90.90]  Tuesday's a Canadian holiday.
[91.14 --> 91.98]  It's Canada Day!
[92.24 --> 93.62]  I wish I had a Canadian flag to wave.
[93.76 --> 94.32]  Hooray!
[94.88 --> 96.08]  I slept in and read a book.
[96.78 --> 97.68]  I gardened.
[98.86 --> 99.84]  We're awesome!
[100.00 --> 100.64]  I know, right?
[101.58 --> 103.70]  Seriously, I came in on Wednesday.
[103.70 --> 106.98]  Anyway, so then I got to work Wednesday, Thursday this week, and that's it.
[107.06 --> 111.12]  I've had four days to do all the things that I normally do in eight days.
[111.90 --> 113.00]  Um, yay.
[113.14 --> 115.60]  Anyway, so I was talking to Brandon when I came in.
[115.66 --> 117.76]  We're filming something, and he's like...
[117.76 --> 119.52]  I was like, he's like, what did you do on your day off?
[119.54 --> 120.70]  I'm like, oh, I did gardening.
[120.84 --> 122.46]  He's like, oh, that's stupid.
[122.60 --> 122.86]  Why?
[123.28 --> 126.06]  I'm like, because I'm a homeowner, asshole.
[127.22 --> 129.04]  It's nice that you live with your parents.
[131.00 --> 132.00]  Someone's got to do it.
[133.70 --> 137.94]  I did my charity stream thing on the weekend because there was that extra day, though.
[138.56 --> 139.20]  So that was cool.
[139.36 --> 142.64]  So you could just be a zombie at work, and I probably wouldn't notice.
[142.64 --> 143.02]  I was fine on Monday.
[143.02 --> 143.82]  You were fine.
[143.96 --> 144.22]  You were fine.
[144.22 --> 145.54]  I was totally fine.
[146.18 --> 149.94]  Because what I did was I forced myself to only sleep for, like, four hours or something,
[150.04 --> 153.16]  and then I went to bed again at, like, 11 o'clock at night.
[153.16 --> 153.26]  Right.
[153.34 --> 154.66]  So then I got a full night of sleep.
[155.40 --> 157.48]  Right, okay, that makes sense.
[157.48 --> 158.70]  I guess I'll let it...
[158.70 --> 159.60]  Just don't touch it.
[159.68 --> 160.58]  Just don't touch it.
[160.68 --> 161.06]  Get out.
[161.28 --> 161.52]  Leave.
[161.88 --> 162.10]  No.
[162.28 --> 162.54]  Brandon!
[162.54 --> 162.74]  Brandon!
[163.50 --> 164.56]  Brandon, stop!
[165.88 --> 167.18]  He runs away.
[167.64 --> 168.76]  You have the door open!
[170.28 --> 171.62]  Come back!
[172.02 --> 173.06]  And then leave again.
[173.10 --> 175.30]  You should throw something at him when he comes in range.
[175.44 --> 175.70]  Boom!
[176.48 --> 178.56]  You just got shave buttered!
[179.84 --> 182.24]  Anyway, welcome to the show, guys.
[182.32 --> 185.08]  We haven't actually managed to say or do anything yet.
[185.16 --> 187.08]  There's a little bit of news this week.
[187.08 --> 190.14]  There's a lot of little things, not a whole lot of big, exciting stuff.
[190.14 --> 190.46]  Yeah.
[190.46 --> 199.32]  Although one big exciting thing is Samsung has released the first SSD on the market with 3D NAND.
[199.54 --> 200.24]  I like that.
[201.02 --> 201.50]  3D!
[201.86 --> 202.78]  Oh, I see.
[202.96 --> 203.08]  Okay.
[203.14 --> 203.38]  NAND.
[203.50 --> 205.28]  Now with 30% more 3D.
[205.28 --> 206.92]  Anyway, so that's...
[206.92 --> 207.68]  Do you need to put more D?
[207.82 --> 209.40]  They talked about it at their summit.
[209.70 --> 214.64]  You can't actually buy one yet, but it's coming soon, and this is exciting for a number of reasons.
[215.06 --> 221.52]  Also in the news this week, 1080p, 60fps is, and I quote, a transformative experience.
[221.96 --> 224.96]  Finally a game developer saying the right thing, and it's a console game.
[225.06 --> 226.04]  Well, yeah.
[226.42 --> 227.50]  The game he's talking about is...
[227.50 --> 228.88]  We need more flags to wave.
[229.00 --> 230.50]  I'll settle for a one-wipe Charlie.
[230.80 --> 231.16]  Oh.
[231.64 --> 234.88]  Actually, it's funny, because Dollar Shave Club isn't even a sponsor of the WAN show today.
[235.72 --> 240.16]  Which is why you're using a one-wipe Charlie as a flag, which is white, and you're waving it like this.
[240.50 --> 241.22]  So you're surrendering?
[241.30 --> 241.80]  I'm not...
[241.80 --> 242.34]  No, I'm not.
[242.48 --> 247.54]  This is what the console people who think that 30fps is enough would be doing.
[247.54 --> 247.90]  There we go.
[248.26 --> 249.22]  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[249.62 --> 250.86]  All right, what else we got today?
[251.02 --> 252.04]  Tesla Model E.
[252.22 --> 253.88]  I'm not going to say anything more than that.
[253.98 --> 255.38]  Just Tesla Model E.
[255.40 --> 255.70]  Yeah.
[255.70 --> 260.42]  And Crytek UK staff not coming to work, which is not a...
[260.42 --> 261.76]  Yeah, no, that's not good.
[262.08 --> 262.98]  That's not good at all.
[263.12 --> 263.54]  All right.
[266.48 --> 266.96]  Awkward.
[267.48 --> 268.18]  And that didn't work.
[268.40 --> 268.82]  Nope.
[269.02 --> 270.24]  I have to change the settings.
[270.68 --> 272.22]  Do not remember playback position.
[273.20 --> 273.90]  And we're back.
[273.90 --> 274.56]  And back again.
[274.70 --> 275.64]  And there we go.
[275.80 --> 276.12]  Yay!
[277.64 --> 278.74]  I love this show.
[280.08 --> 280.90]  Oh, man.
[281.02 --> 284.12]  We should just have, like, named it the new show.
[284.64 --> 285.48]  Nothing ever works.
[285.48 --> 287.22]  There you go.
[288.00 --> 288.96]  The new show.
[289.06 --> 291.04]  It's like news and nothing ever works.
[291.12 --> 293.48]  It's like a double entendre.
[293.58 --> 293.84]  Yeah.
[294.40 --> 295.32]  It's like how PHP...
[295.32 --> 296.08]  Freaking genius.
[296.32 --> 298.00]  PHP, the P stands for PHP.
[298.92 --> 299.40]  Really?
[299.60 --> 299.80]  Yeah.
[300.10 --> 301.38]  Oh, that's a terrible thing.
[301.78 --> 302.52]  All right.
[302.66 --> 307.34]  So, speaking of things that are not terrible, Squarespace is one of our sponsors today.
[307.46 --> 311.26]  Get 10% off your Squarespace subscription with offer code Linus.
[311.26 --> 311.70]  Yes.
[313.44 --> 317.80]  Also a sponsor of the show, and this is a new sponsor today, is 5-4 Club.
[317.96 --> 323.70]  They actually have a special 4th of July deal, which we'll tell you more about later on.
[324.14 --> 326.52]  And actually, I completely did the wrong thing.
[326.60 --> 327.50]  That wasn't what I meant to do.
[327.60 --> 328.02]  Well, whatever.
[328.02 --> 330.28]  The lower third is there, so you guys can...
[330.28 --> 330.36]  It worked.
[330.36 --> 331.26]  I gave away the deal.
[331.38 --> 332.82]  I didn't mean to tell them the deal yet.
[332.92 --> 334.04]  It was supposed to just be a little...
[334.04 --> 336.36]  You meant to do the splash thing that we showed at the beginning, actually.
[336.48 --> 337.04]  It's a slam.
[337.34 --> 337.54]  Oh.
[338.12 --> 338.42]  Yay!
[338.56 --> 339.78]  Big freaking cable.
[341.24 --> 342.62]  Anyway, don't look at the deal.
[343.12 --> 344.42]  Listen to me talk about it later.
[344.52 --> 349.74]  The point is 5-4 Club is good, and we have a special 4th of July deal for our American friends.
[350.02 --> 351.60]  And also the Americans that we hate.
[352.14 --> 352.46]  Oh.
[352.64 --> 353.58]  Well, anyone can have it.
[353.76 --> 354.38]  That's the point.
[355.12 --> 357.22]  Do you hate any specific Americans?
[357.42 --> 357.58]  No.
[358.82 --> 362.44]  I'm just saying, I'm sure there's got to be one American that I can't stand.
[362.82 --> 363.14]  Yeah.
[363.14 --> 364.06]  I mean, Bieber.
[364.34 --> 365.72]  He's basically American now.
[365.84 --> 366.84]  He doesn't live here anymore.
[369.08 --> 370.26]  He's yours now.
[371.48 --> 371.92]  Owned.
[372.42 --> 372.90]  Okay.
[373.20 --> 377.32]  So let's move on to our very first topic of the day.
[377.84 --> 378.40]  850 Pro.
[378.88 --> 381.04]  The 850 Pro.
[381.32 --> 381.72]  50 Pro.
[381.72 --> 383.10]  I'm used to saying 40.
[383.56 --> 384.12]  I'm on tech.
[384.20 --> 388.08]  The site where I still go for most of my SSD coverage.
[388.30 --> 391.50]  Because they still do a fantastic job of SSD coverage.
[391.70 --> 394.40]  So the Samsung had a global summit.
[394.76 --> 396.64]  They talked about VNAND.
[396.76 --> 399.38]  They talked about, well, mostly they talked about NAND.
[399.50 --> 402.66]  So what's the point of the 850 Pro?
[402.78 --> 403.58]  What's good about it?
[403.62 --> 409.34]  The 840 Pro has been on the market for a long, long time now.
[409.34 --> 415.70]  And as disappointing as it is that Samsung hasn't released a new enthusiast professional
[415.70 --> 417.00]  grade SSD in so long.
[417.00 --> 417.42]  I thought you were talking about the 840.
[417.54 --> 418.58]  I was like, I liked the 840.
[418.68 --> 419.50]  Why is it disappointing?
[419.72 --> 419.82]  Yeah.
[419.86 --> 420.14]  No, no.
[420.20 --> 423.00]  It's disappointing that they haven't released a new one in so long.
[423.00 --> 428.32]  But the cold hard truth is that the 840 Pro never really got dethroned.
[428.88 --> 428.98]  Nope.
[429.38 --> 431.70]  Like it kind of did.
[431.86 --> 433.90]  There's higher capacity drives now.
[434.56 --> 436.90]  There are slightly faster drives now.
[437.12 --> 442.50]  There are drives with better performance consistency, such as the Intel 730 series.
[442.50 --> 448.50]  But in terms of just like defeating it across the board, the 840 Pro has held up incredibly
[448.50 --> 448.82]  well.
[448.94 --> 453.72]  Not to mention that Samsung's software suite enables it to perform even better.
[453.72 --> 457.30]  So you can do things like you can cache the drive with RAM and all that kind of good stuff
[457.30 --> 457.74]  as well.
[457.82 --> 460.52]  They did release the Evo, but are you talking about like in that same series?
[460.78 --> 461.02]  Yeah.
[461.18 --> 463.38]  Well, the Evo's not as fast as the 840 Pro.
[463.56 --> 463.78]  Yeah.
[463.96 --> 465.56]  I'm just saying like they have released another.
[465.56 --> 471.48]  So Samsung has dropped the 850 Pro on us now and it's faster.
[471.74 --> 472.86]  It's higher capacity.
[472.98 --> 474.04]  It goes up to one terabyte.
[474.32 --> 477.62]  It will potentially deliver higher capacities in the future.
[477.84 --> 482.24]  It actually lasts longer, which is the first time we've seen that in a while.
[482.34 --> 488.60]  One of the big problems with SSDs as they've progressed throughout the generations is that
[488.60 --> 493.86]  newer manufacturing processes have actually reduced their lifespans.
[493.86 --> 501.32]  Now, a lot of noise gets made about that by hard drive manufacturers or just general,
[501.68 --> 505.50]  you know, doom profits and those kinds of people.
[505.96 --> 510.96]  But the cold hard truth is I believe it's tech report and I know that extreme systems have
[510.96 --> 516.72]  got long-term SSD reliability tests where we've got SSDs that are rated for X number of
[516.72 --> 521.36]  terabytes that are writing like a petabyte of data before they actually die.
[521.36 --> 526.58]  It's endurance rated for 150 terabytes, but they have one in internal testing.
[526.68 --> 529.34]  And this is for the 850 Pro, not for existing drives.
[529.48 --> 529.58]  Yeah.
[529.76 --> 532.68]  Internal testing that has gone through over eight petabytes.
[532.94 --> 535.86]  So guys, don't read too much into those rated specs.
[536.00 --> 540.16]  They have been getting lower as time goes on, but that's what's great about this new
[540.16 --> 541.56]  NAND that Samsung has unleashed.
[541.56 --> 546.40]  Samsung has actually been, you know, it's funny because we always expected it to be, you know,
[546.46 --> 551.10]  the more, the more traditional guys like, you know, an Intel or a Micron to be pushing
[551.10 --> 552.14]  all this stuff forward.
[552.56 --> 555.84]  But Samsung was the first to do TLC.
[556.30 --> 560.28]  So that's three bits per cell in their, uh, crap.
[560.40 --> 561.52]  I'm blanking now.
[561.58 --> 562.54]  What drive was that?
[562.64 --> 563.22]  Model names.
[563.44 --> 564.20]  Not good with them.
[564.36 --> 564.62]  Yeah.
[564.62 --> 565.70]  I think it was the 840.
[566.02 --> 566.34]  Anyway.
[566.44 --> 567.26]  Yeah, it was the 840.
[567.36 --> 570.30]  So they were the first to do their, a TLC NAND drive.
[570.34 --> 570.78]  That sounds right.
[570.82 --> 574.84]  And they were able to achieve good enough reliability and performance to make it, uh,
[574.84 --> 576.24]  an actual product out of it.
[576.28 --> 578.40]  And now they're the first with 3D.
[578.80 --> 580.56]  So I think, I don't know.
[580.62 --> 582.94]  That's pretty much it other than giving you guys some specifics.
[582.94 --> 587.32]  So we have a clicky link to the exact, uh, the exact specs here.
[587.96 --> 590.50]  And it's funny because specs don't really change that much.
[590.50 --> 592.78]  We're still going to be limited by the SATA 3 interface.
[593.14 --> 596.56]  So you're still not going to see more than a hundred thousand random read IOPS.
[596.64 --> 599.36]  You're still not going to see more than 90,000 random write IOPS.
[599.70 --> 605.22]  But cool things about it are that the lowest capacity drive doesn't perform that much worse
[605.22 --> 606.54]  than any of the others.
[606.56 --> 608.50]  This is a 128 gig drive.
[608.60 --> 609.78]  So it doesn't perform worse.
[609.78 --> 617.32]  And the 128 gig model is the one that they have in testing writing over eight petabytes.
[617.32 --> 623.96]  So typically whatever the lowest capacity one is performs the least well because it's not
[623.96 --> 627.66]  able to take advantage of parallelization in its reads and writes.
[627.66 --> 634.08]  And then it also typically is not going to last as long because just simple, it's actually
[634.08 --> 635.02]  really simple math.
[635.08 --> 636.74]  It's kind of cool how simple the math is.
[636.74 --> 642.98]  When you have a higher capacity drive and a lower capacity drive and each NAND cell has
[642.98 --> 645.66]  X number of writes of endurance.
[646.08 --> 649.90]  If you write X number of terabytes to each of them, you're going to be filling this.
[649.96 --> 652.86]  Let's say you write up the entire capacity of this drive and it's 10 times the capacity
[652.86 --> 653.18]  of this.
[653.30 --> 657.26]  You just wrote every cell here 10 times and every cell here once.
[657.40 --> 660.74]  So a lower capacity drive is just inherently not going to last as long.
[660.74 --> 661.54]  It's usually going to be slower.
[661.68 --> 662.58]  It's not going to last as long.
[662.58 --> 668.04]  So theoretically, if Samsung was running that test on their one terabyte drive, it could
[668.04 --> 669.06]  have done 80 petabytes.
[669.66 --> 671.16]  But that's, I mean, don't quote me on that.
[671.26 --> 672.82]  That's not a rating.
[673.12 --> 677.94]  It's just in theory, in theory, totally not.
[678.08 --> 678.22]  Okay.
[678.30 --> 679.30]  Just forget I ever said it.
[679.30 --> 680.76]  He just said theory very many times.
[680.76 --> 680.94]  Yeah.
[681.18 --> 681.80]  Don't forget.
[682.22 --> 686.80]  In theory, there's a lot of overhead involved in where leveling and the algorithms that keep
[686.80 --> 690.86]  the NAND working for so long that will make it not scale 100% like that.
[690.86 --> 692.74]  Let's just be really clear about that in the first place.
[693.10 --> 697.18]  One of the other things that Samsung's really stepping up their game with on the 850 Pro
[697.18 --> 699.26]  is that they're offering a 10-year warranty.
[700.24 --> 700.52]  Whoa.
[701.58 --> 702.38]  You didn't know that, did you?
[702.38 --> 703.18]  I didn't know that part.
[703.44 --> 703.76]  Yeah.
[703.92 --> 704.62]  That's aggressive.
[704.96 --> 709.04]  Five years was already, in my mind, pretty aggressive for a storage device.
[709.04 --> 716.38]  I mean, when you think about what a warranty is, a warranty is within the reasonably usable
[716.38 --> 718.00]  lifespan of the product.
[718.92 --> 720.14]  This is going to work, dog.
[720.26 --> 721.50]  Be confident buying it.
[721.80 --> 727.56]  So for something like a computer, a three-year warranty is pretty good because you're probably
[727.56 --> 729.72]  going to want to replace it with something faster by that point.
[729.72 --> 734.10]  Or, you know, laptops, you'll probably have beaten them up by that point or whatever.
[735.70 --> 742.54]  With a storage device, especially a little while ago when capacities were really scaling
[742.54 --> 745.26]  fast, five years was kind of ridiculous.
[745.54 --> 753.10]  I mean, drives that I have that are five years old are going to be like 320, 250 gig drives.
[753.36 --> 756.08]  Even 120 gigabyte SSD in five years?
[756.08 --> 756.32]  Yeah.
[756.48 --> 756.68]  Dude.
[757.20 --> 757.84]  It's like, what?
[758.84 --> 763.50]  I mean, maybe part of it is that they're just that confident that they're all going
[763.50 --> 763.90]  to last.
[764.02 --> 764.84]  So whatever.
[765.00 --> 766.32]  We'll just throw a 10-year warranty at it.
[766.34 --> 766.76]  Who cares?
[767.24 --> 771.92]  And then maybe part of it is just the whole RAM manufacturer mentality.
[772.24 --> 776.20]  Where you know how every stick of RAM seemingly has a lifetime warranty on it?
[776.20 --> 776.30]  Yeah.
[776.50 --> 776.62]  Yeah.
[776.70 --> 778.40]  And maybe it's just for much the same reason.
[778.46 --> 779.74]  Maybe that's exactly it.
[780.12 --> 784.78]  10 years from now, no one's going to give two craps about this EDO RAM.
[784.78 --> 786.92]  So whatever.
[787.26 --> 788.00]  Lifetime warranty.
[788.30 --> 795.34]  If they really want some SD RAM or they really want some DDR1 memory, it's five years, 10 years,
[795.46 --> 796.62]  25 years down the road.
[796.68 --> 797.44]  Who gives a crap?
[797.50 --> 798.22]  We'll just give it to them.
[798.72 --> 799.06]  Yeah.
[799.06 --> 803.48]  For the number of customers that are actually going to do that versus not having a competitive
[803.48 --> 806.04]  warranty with what the other companies are offering.
[806.58 --> 809.96]  I'll be interested to see if other guys match this.
[810.42 --> 812.54]  Crucial is such a conservative company.
[813.02 --> 814.58]  Intel is such a conservative company.
[814.58 --> 817.06]  I mean, they blew me away when they offered a five-year warranty.
[817.46 --> 817.50]  Yeah.
[817.60 --> 822.66]  On an Intel CPU, which, let's face it, is going to last for five years or 10 years.
[822.86 --> 823.40]  CPUs in general.
[823.60 --> 825.20]  Have you ever seen a dead one?
[825.54 --> 825.80]  No.
[826.90 --> 830.06]  That wasn't like someone stepped on this.
[830.12 --> 830.32]  Yeah.
[830.40 --> 831.10]  Or something like that.
[831.10 --> 837.08]  Like one that died in use where the person wasn't either A, dangerously overclocking it.
[837.08 --> 837.30]  Yes.
[837.42 --> 841.14]  Or B, like physically harmed it probably on purpose.
[841.24 --> 842.20]  They just don't die.
[842.32 --> 842.48]  No.
[842.70 --> 845.88]  And they still only offer a three-year warranty on their processors.
[845.88 --> 850.86]  So, I mean, for Intel to be confident enough to offer a 10-year warranty, they'd probably
[850.86 --> 853.12]  have to be sure it's going to last for like 50 years.
[853.96 --> 856.82]  Anyway, I'll be interested to see what comes of that.
[857.54 --> 858.76]  Most things are over-engineered.
[858.90 --> 863.00]  The rating on how much data is going to go through that SSD is probably over-engineered,
[863.30 --> 867.80]  considering we're looking at eight petabytes in what they're actually doing and 150 terabytes
[867.80 --> 871.94]  in the estimation, and warranties are definitely over-engineered.
[872.46 --> 876.44]  If they're warranting it for a certain period of time, it's probably going to last a lot
[876.44 --> 877.08]  longer than that.
[877.30 --> 877.52]  All right.
[877.56 --> 879.66]  So let's talk a little bit about the changes that they've made.
[879.70 --> 884.54]  Now, I talked about how traditionally, as we've scaled down the manufacturing process
[884.54 --> 890.22]  for NAND in order to drive capacity up and prices down, the reliability and the performance
[890.22 --> 891.18]  has gotten worse.
[891.52 --> 896.74]  This is just, it's just because things are getting so packed in that there's, things can
[896.74 --> 900.10]  easily leak from one place to another, and it just, it just doesn't work that well at
[900.10 --> 900.90]  such a tiny scale.
[901.00 --> 906.76]  So now, instead of building out the NAND chips two-dimensionally, so where they're just spreading
[906.76 --> 910.38]  things out, so they have to make everything smaller to keep everything close enough together
[910.38 --> 914.00]  to even work, now Samsung is actually stacking it.
[914.04 --> 915.02]  That's what 3D NAND is.
[915.08 --> 921.80]  So instead of using a 10 nanometer class manufacturing process, they've actually relaxed to a 40 nanometer
[921.80 --> 923.30]  class manufacturing process.
[923.66 --> 925.94]  I mean, that's, that's like old stuff.
[926.22 --> 926.34]  Yeah.
[926.74 --> 929.94]  That's like a couple of gens ago, like CPUs.
[930.10 --> 931.32]  That was advanced.
[931.32 --> 933.44]  Like this is, yeah.
[933.68 --> 936.88]  But that gives them that better reliability and that better performance.
[937.26 --> 940.72]  And because they're stacking them, they can still scale capacity.
[940.88 --> 947.82]  So we could expect to see as they scale the manufacturing back down again, much, much higher capacities
[947.82 --> 950.06]  and much lower prices as time goes on.
[950.18 --> 951.74]  Right now, it's cutting edge technology.
[951.74 --> 956.08]  You're only going to find it in a pro class product, which as you can expect, the 850 Pro
[956.08 --> 961.04]  is pretty expensive compared to more value oriented SSDs.
[961.08 --> 962.48]  There's some pretty cheap SSDs out there.
[962.48 --> 967.62]  I was going to say, it's only $10 more for 120 and 240 gig capacities compared to an 840 Pro.
[967.62 --> 971.96]  And it is exactly $1 cheaper in the 480 gigabyte capacity.
[971.96 --> 972.20]  Yeah.
[972.20 --> 977.70]  So that puts it actually very competitively priced against other premium drives from guys
[977.70 --> 989.62]  like Intel with their 730, but not even close to value stuff like Crucial's M550, which comes in at only around just under $300 for a 500 gig class drive.
[989.62 --> 991.06]  Which is crazy.
[991.06 --> 992.66]  I mean, is it finally happening?
[992.76 --> 993.80]  Are SSDs cheap now?
[993.96 --> 996.04]  I don't necessarily think we're quite there yet.
[996.12 --> 1003.48]  I think it's cheap enough that like every single time I see a build, I'm trying to help them balance their build out so that they can get an SSD in there.
[1003.56 --> 1003.76]  Right.
[1003.92 --> 1005.90]  Because it's worth it at this point.
[1006.16 --> 1009.44]  But I don't see a ton of people going SSD only systems yet.
[1010.28 --> 1017.96]  I see it a lot more and I am seeing it in general, but I still see a lot of people throwing in like at least two terabyte hard drive in most of their systems.
[1017.96 --> 1019.02]  Yeah, now that you mention it.
[1019.02 --> 1019.96]  Games are still really big.
[1020.40 --> 1022.94]  And a lot of games coming out are like 50 gigs, which is insane.
[1023.14 --> 1026.60]  I feel like I did miss something on my Blade 14 review.
[1026.78 --> 1029.12]  Now that you're mentioning that, now that I'm thinking about it.
[1029.16 --> 1031.08]  The Blade 14 is an amazing machine.
[1031.46 --> 1032.86]  Just a spoiler alert, guys.
[1032.92 --> 1034.94]  That's actually going to come out sometime next week.
[1035.24 --> 1039.16]  And for the first time ever, I awarded something an Editor's Choice Award.
[1039.30 --> 1040.76]  I don't want us to start doing that.
[1040.82 --> 1041.24]  I don't care.
[1041.32 --> 1041.74]  It's perfect.
[1042.18 --> 1042.48]  Almost.
[1043.36 --> 1044.02]  It's almost.
[1044.62 --> 1046.36]  I'm probably never going to award one again.
[1046.36 --> 1048.58]  In five years, I've done it once.
[1048.80 --> 1050.24]  So let's just leave it at that.
[1051.04 --> 1054.08]  But it's absolutely fantastic.
[1054.52 --> 1062.86]  Although, now that you mention it, the problem is that in order to make it fit in that amazing form factor, they've got one M.2 SSD.
[1063.46 --> 1064.64]  And that was all that was going to fit.
[1064.70 --> 1066.90]  There is no two and a half inch drive cage.
[1067.98 --> 1071.84]  So you're a little bit limited in terms of storage.
[1071.84 --> 1076.74]  The most you can do is they've got a 512 gig laptop option.
[1077.10 --> 1079.14]  And then you have to basically buy that up front.
[1079.72 --> 1085.24]  They don't even, actually, another knock that I did mention in the review is that it does not have upgradable RAM.
[1086.06 --> 1088.72]  It has a soldered 8 gigs of RAM.
[1088.92 --> 1089.22]  What?
[1089.32 --> 1090.90]  There is no 16 gig option.
[1091.68 --> 1093.60]  So they got called out pretty hard for that.
[1093.72 --> 1097.28]  This basically perfect judgment seems slightly...
[1097.28 --> 1097.84]  It's...
[1097.84 --> 1099.02]  Have you used it?
[1099.28 --> 1099.50]  No.
[1099.50 --> 1101.98]  Okay, well, it's pretty amazing.
[1102.16 --> 1104.26]  I mean, having an 870M in this...
[1104.26 --> 1104.30]  Can it be this?
[1105.12 --> 1105.38]  No.
[1106.30 --> 1108.20]  But I don't necessarily care about that.
[1108.26 --> 1110.86]  I don't use the tablet-iness of this very often.
[1111.00 --> 1116.82]  I mean, in my Surface Pro, I think I estimated 2% of the time that I use this notebook, I'm using the tablet.
[1117.00 --> 1118.28]  That was probably aggressive.
[1118.62 --> 1124.08]  When I had a laptop that could turn into a tablet, I actually used it a lot.
[1124.36 --> 1124.68]  Okay.
[1125.00 --> 1126.96]  But then that's going to vary.
[1127.24 --> 1128.98]  So if it doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter to you.
[1128.98 --> 1131.44]  And the 870M doesn't throttle.
[1132.32 --> 1132.98]  That's kind of cool.
[1133.04 --> 1133.30]  Which is...
[1133.30 --> 1134.74]  It actually boosts a little bit.
[1135.30 --> 1137.74]  And that was two days ago when it was super hot.
[1137.88 --> 1138.32]  Yeah, yeah.
[1138.36 --> 1139.02]  That was really hot.
[1139.24 --> 1139.56]  So...
[1139.56 --> 1140.30]  Okay, we need to...
[1140.30 --> 1141.96]  I don't like that repeatedly hitting the cable.
[1142.38 --> 1142.66]  Brandon!
[1143.30 --> 1143.52]  Huh?
[1143.60 --> 1144.26]  It's not a big deal.
[1144.28 --> 1144.62]  I'll grab it.
[1144.90 --> 1146.18]  Okay, we want to move on to our next topic?
[1146.44 --> 1146.78]  Sure.
[1146.90 --> 1148.64]  If I can figure out what it is.
[1148.64 --> 1148.98]  Ow!
[1149.18 --> 1149.58]  Don't.
[1149.88 --> 1151.42]  Thank you for sitting on my headphones.
[1151.56 --> 1152.18]  You put it there.
[1152.18 --> 1154.64]  I did not put my headphones under your butt.
[1154.68 --> 1155.14]  Are you sure?
[1155.30 --> 1155.86]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[1157.36 --> 1161.34]  Pretty sure the butt would have had to get there after the headphones did.
[1161.52 --> 1162.34]  I don't know.
[1163.38 --> 1164.22]  I don't know.
[1164.36 --> 1167.84]  Anyways, Tesla Model E 30,000.
[1167.84 --> 1170.66]  How did I know that that topic was going to be the first one you brought up?
[1170.74 --> 1172.38]  It's the next one in the dock!
[1172.60 --> 1173.76]  I didn't even...
[1173.76 --> 1175.04]  Maybe that's how I knew.
[1175.40 --> 1175.62]  Why?
[1175.70 --> 1177.32]  What did you think I was implying?
[1177.70 --> 1181.46]  Alright, so we're going to head over to our good buddy John Rettinger's website.
[1181.84 --> 1183.88]  Techno Buffalo is our source for this one.
[1184.40 --> 1189.70]  At 30 grand, the Tesla Model E will be the company's most affordable car.
[1189.70 --> 1192.52]  I want to know when they're going to release a Model T.
[1194.22 --> 1195.48]  They should totally do it.
[1195.48 --> 1197.96]  Like a retro-looking electric car?
[1198.10 --> 1199.60]  That would be really cool, actually.
[1199.66 --> 1200.46]  That would be badass.
[1200.52 --> 1201.48]  You know those like...
[1202.26 --> 1204.48]  Now I'm going to say steampunk, but it's not right.
[1204.72 --> 1210.12]  But when it looks old, but they just put the nice cool blue LED lighting in it and stuff.
[1210.58 --> 1212.68]  And it makes it look like this weird mashup.
[1212.74 --> 1213.78]  That would be so sweet.
[1214.28 --> 1215.20]  I would love to...
[1215.20 --> 1216.38]  A wood-paneled Tesla?
[1216.38 --> 1219.84]  I'm sure Ford would not have any of that.
[1220.14 --> 1220.34]  No!
[1220.84 --> 1222.92]  But it would be pretty awesome.
[1222.92 --> 1228.58]  Or if they did like the Model horizontal and vertical line.
[1228.66 --> 1229.54]  And then they used the Tesla T.
[1230.70 --> 1232.14]  I don't think they'd get away with it.
[1232.80 --> 1234.10]  But that would be so cool.
[1234.12 --> 1238.30]  They could just call it the Model and then put the symbol for the Tesla T on the side of it.
[1238.32 --> 1239.16]  The Tesla Model.
[1239.44 --> 1240.22]  The Tesla Model.
[1240.24 --> 1241.80]  Do it as like a limited edition run?
[1242.28 --> 1243.42]  I would love to see that.
[1243.50 --> 1245.94]  So you can't say it's the Model T.
[1246.74 --> 1247.42]  Messaging Nick.
[1247.52 --> 1247.92]  Oh.
[1247.92 --> 1250.44]  I better make sure there's nothing incriminating here.
[1250.72 --> 1251.02]  God.
[1254.92 --> 1255.40]  Oh.
[1260.40 --> 1260.76]  Okay.
[1260.90 --> 1261.52]  Well, that's good to know.
[1261.78 --> 1262.08]  Okay.
[1262.50 --> 1264.82]  So let's go ahead and...
[1264.82 --> 1265.08]  Oh, yeah.
[1265.08 --> 1265.46]  That's fine.
[1266.04 --> 1266.98]  Not really, but sure.
[1267.04 --> 1267.52]  We'll go with it.
[1268.06 --> 1269.92]  What was I going to say?
[1270.08 --> 1272.16]  There's not a ton of information yet.
[1272.24 --> 1274.16]  It would be launching in about 2016.
[1274.76 --> 1275.12]  Yeah.
[1275.28 --> 1276.70]  So we're not exactly close.
[1276.94 --> 1280.56]  It's expected to be about 20% smaller than the current Model S.
[1280.68 --> 1280.82]  Yeah.
[1280.86 --> 1283.72]  And they're going to drop things like they're probably going to be swapping out aluminum
[1283.72 --> 1285.38]  for steel and a few other things like that.
[1285.42 --> 1287.16]  But like it's a way cheaper car.
[1287.78 --> 1288.34]  Thank you.
[1288.44 --> 1291.20]  Can you like push the cable down and then close the door so you don't...
[1291.20 --> 1293.00]  So they don't jam the...
[1293.00 --> 1293.88]  Thank you.
[1294.52 --> 1294.92]  Thank you.
[1296.04 --> 1296.72]  Don't...
[1296.72 --> 1299.00]  Has he done it to your satisfaction?
[1299.44 --> 1299.68]  Yes.
[1299.86 --> 1300.14]  All right.
[1300.14 --> 1306.14]  We just finished like terminating a whole bunch of Cat 6A and that cable is huge.
[1306.44 --> 1309.24]  And it's going under the doors and it keeps getting slammed on by the doors and I don't
[1309.24 --> 1310.40]  want to destroy my work.
[1310.44 --> 1311.60]  Probably slam resistant.
[1312.56 --> 1315.20]  I mean, it's pretty beast in every other possible way.
[1315.38 --> 1315.74]  It is.
[1315.96 --> 1319.38]  I think this is actually really cool because I'm not going to go out and buy a new one,
[1319.38 --> 1324.28]  but that means if it starts at 30 grand years afterwards, it will have to be cheaper.
[1324.70 --> 1324.82]  Right.
[1326.16 --> 1327.30]  I'm pretty stoked.
[1327.30 --> 1334.60]  I mean, the big thing turning me off of the Model S is number one, that I don't buy new
[1334.60 --> 1336.44]  cars because I think it's insane.
[1336.70 --> 1338.98]  And there's like not enough of them because it's at a weird price bracket.
[1339.02 --> 1339.18]  Yeah.
[1339.26 --> 1343.88]  And then number two is that there's not enough used ones.
[1344.22 --> 1344.36]  Yeah.
[1344.86 --> 1345.10]  Yeah.
[1345.20 --> 1347.46]  So I guess those are both really the same thing.
[1347.74 --> 1348.86]  Also, it's very, very expensive.
[1349.02 --> 1353.98]  So I used Model E a few years after it comes out.
[1354.48 --> 1356.08]  That's going to be when I go electric.
[1356.08 --> 1360.64]  And especially if they have that very aggressive battery swapping stuff going on.
[1361.14 --> 1361.46]  Yes.
[1361.94 --> 1362.80]  That would be pretty sweet.
[1363.06 --> 1363.44]  I don't know.
[1363.64 --> 1365.04]  I'm pretty excited about this actually.
[1365.46 --> 1365.62]  Yeah.
[1365.68 --> 1366.60]  I needed something like that.
[1366.66 --> 1368.30]  It's going to be cheaper constructed.
[1368.60 --> 1371.12]  I'll be surprised if they can achieve the same range with it.
[1371.20 --> 1374.42]  They're expecting steel construction instead of aluminum construction.
[1375.12 --> 1377.52]  It's going to come out after the Model X.
[1377.52 --> 1378.94]  So that's the SUV model.
[1379.16 --> 1380.40]  So no time soon.
[1380.58 --> 1385.64]  But word on the street is it's going to be priced to compete with the Audi A4 and BMW
[1385.64 --> 1387.14]  Compact 3 series.
[1387.14 --> 1391.54]  And if they do this and if they keep dropping rumors and stuff like that, that means other
[1391.54 --> 1392.76]  people are probably going to do it too.
[1393.08 --> 1395.26]  And competition in the electric vehicle space is good.
[1395.44 --> 1395.72]  Yeah.
[1395.90 --> 1397.06]  I'm super stoked on that.
[1397.12 --> 1398.22]  I'd love to drive an EV.
[1398.64 --> 1398.88]  Yeah.
[1399.04 --> 1400.02]  That would be fantastic.
[1400.22 --> 1403.56]  Because gas prices where we live are dumb.
[1403.76 --> 1404.18]  Yeah.
[1404.26 --> 1405.52]  Not if that is Europe, mind you.
[1405.62 --> 1406.54]  But still dumb.
[1406.74 --> 1407.04]  Yes.
[1407.64 --> 1408.10]  All right.
[1408.24 --> 1409.28]  So let's go ahead.
[1410.38 --> 1414.32]  And this was originally posted on the forum by Top War Gamer.
[1415.02 --> 1416.84]  Still trouble at Crytek.
[1417.10 --> 1418.32]  This was actually a few days ago.
[1418.42 --> 1420.10]  It's not really like news news.
[1420.24 --> 1423.58]  But there hasn't been anything else that's come out in the last couple of days.
[1423.70 --> 1425.24]  So I checked it out.
[1425.52 --> 1426.60]  Or at least today.
[1427.18 --> 1428.10]  Oh, you mean about this?
[1428.18 --> 1428.94]  Yeah, about this.
[1428.94 --> 1429.04]  Yeah.
[1429.04 --> 1434.12]  So basically there were rumors that Crytek was on the brink of bankruptcy.
[1434.12 --> 1438.78]  And then they came out and were like, no, no, that's not happening at all.
[1438.92 --> 1440.42]  We're just not paying our employees.
[1441.06 --> 1441.30]  Yeah.
[1441.48 --> 1445.56]  But there are multiple internal sources coming out saying they haven't been paid properly
[1445.56 --> 1446.48]  since April.
[1447.20 --> 1450.64]  And apparently an estimated, what was it?
[1450.68 --> 1452.60]  Something like a hundred staff?
[1452.84 --> 1453.04]  Yeah.
[1453.18 --> 1458.40]  The studio estimates that around a hundred people have left after filing grievances.
[1458.70 --> 1460.20]  A person familiar with the studio.
[1460.30 --> 1460.46]  Yes.
[1460.72 --> 1461.14]  Sorry.
[1461.26 --> 1461.42]  Sorry.
[1461.42 --> 1461.70]  Sorry.
[1462.02 --> 1463.16]  Person familiar with the studio.
[1463.16 --> 1466.82]  That about a hundred people have left after filing grievances.
[1467.04 --> 1469.20]  It's unclear if they're leaving permanently.
[1469.60 --> 1474.38]  If they're just kind of waiting for Crytek to get their stuff together.
[1474.82 --> 1481.16]  Apparently it's gone as far as employees at Crytek UK are like publicly hoping that Deep Silver
[1481.16 --> 1481.84]  buys them.
[1482.56 --> 1485.54]  So like, I think this has kind of been going around for a while.
[1485.64 --> 1486.68]  It's just been under a cap.
[1487.38 --> 1487.64]  Yeah.
[1487.64 --> 1488.86]  Which is kind of sketchy.
[1488.96 --> 1489.74]  The cat's out of the bag.
[1489.74 --> 1490.58]  I mean...
[1490.58 --> 1494.00]  You can't imagine the Xbox One launch sales were that amazing, especially when Rise got
[1494.00 --> 1496.10]  slammed by like every reviewer ever.
[1496.36 --> 1496.84]  Yeah.
[1497.08 --> 1498.70]  It really wasn't reviewed very well.
[1498.78 --> 1500.88]  And then they just launched their, uh...
[1500.88 --> 1501.42]  What's this thing?
[1501.48 --> 1502.40]  What's this game called?
[1503.16 --> 1504.66]  Crytek's new game, War something?
[1507.46 --> 1507.94]  War...
[1507.94 --> 1508.98]  War...
[1508.98 --> 1510.66]  Yeah, they just launched a free-to-play game.
[1510.72 --> 1511.44]  I can't even remember.
[1511.56 --> 1512.32]  Nobody cared.
[1512.50 --> 1512.76]  I...
[1512.76 --> 1515.86]  I hadn't even heard of it until they just launched it.
[1515.86 --> 1516.00]  Warface.
[1516.08 --> 1516.52]  Yeah, Warface.
[1516.52 --> 1519.02]  I thought it was Warface, but I was like, that name seems so generic.
[1519.54 --> 1520.38]  It can't be that.
[1520.98 --> 1521.98]  Yeah, so War...
[1521.98 --> 1523.26]  Warface is out, um...
[1523.26 --> 1523.86]  It's on Steam?
[1524.28 --> 1524.56]  Yeah.
[1526.90 --> 1527.82]  Yeah, no, like...
[1527.82 --> 1529.48]  No one...
[1529.48 --> 1530.18]  No one cared.
[1530.18 --> 1531.42]  I thought it was a console thing.
[1531.50 --> 1532.00]  At all.
[1532.10 --> 1534.76]  So it's a free-to-play slash pay-to-win type game.
[1534.96 --> 1536.96]  Oh, that's why I haven't heard of it and didn't care.
[1537.34 --> 1537.98]  That makes sense.
[1538.56 --> 1539.10]  Oh, God.
[1539.30 --> 1539.76]  That, yeah.
[1539.94 --> 1542.18]  So, so that's, that's, I mean, that's where they're at.
[1542.24 --> 1544.44]  I mean, they don't charge much to license their engine.
[1544.64 --> 1547.10]  And that's something that a lot of gamers are concerned about.
[1547.18 --> 1551.28]  What happens to games that rely on CryEngine right now?
[1551.34 --> 1553.46]  I mean, is the, is the engine going to get ongoing support?
[1553.46 --> 1554.24]  How's this going to work?
[1554.32 --> 1556.94]  I mean, has Crytek just overstretched their bounds?
[1557.04 --> 1558.98]  They have, what, nine studios now?
[1559.16 --> 1559.90]  Nine locations?
[1559.90 --> 1564.00]  And you're kind of looking at it going, well, how many games do you actually make?
[1564.76 --> 1566.20]  Like, what do you people do all day?
[1566.40 --> 1571.92]  Well, Crytek, yeah, Crytek UK closing down isn't going to close down the whole of Crytek.
[1571.92 --> 1575.44]  No, but if they can't pay Crytek UK, then...
[1575.44 --> 1576.32]  That is kind of an issue.
[1576.52 --> 1577.14]  Yeah, you're right.
[1577.94 --> 1578.64]  But I don't know.
[1578.64 --> 1581.02]  I'm not super worried about their engine at this point.
[1581.02 --> 1585.98]  But then again, at the same point in time, big people like Star Citizen are just chopping
[1585.98 --> 1587.34]  the crap out of the engine anyways.
[1587.68 --> 1589.14]  So it probably won't even matter.
[1589.64 --> 1589.74]  Right.
[1589.74 --> 1595.54]  Because at this point in time, I'm sure whatever they're working with is so far away from the
[1595.54 --> 1599.70]  original design that any updates to it, they'd probably have to pretty much do themselves
[1599.70 --> 1599.96]  anyway.
[1600.84 --> 1601.94]  So, I don't know.
[1602.14 --> 1605.68]  But then smaller studios that would want to use Crytek extension because it is beautiful
[1605.68 --> 1610.58]  and is actually pushing limits on PC hardware, unlike a lot of different engines, might have
[1610.58 --> 1612.50]  issues because they would have to rely much more heavily.
[1612.56 --> 1617.30]  I mean, I think that's the thing that I'll both miss about the most and regret that they
[1617.30 --> 1624.06]  didn't stick to is the fact that they were willing to push the PC beyond its limits and build
[1624.06 --> 1625.26]  something that was truly groundbreaking.
[1625.26 --> 1631.28]  I mean, the thing about that, though, is the last time they did that was a really long time
[1631.28 --> 1631.50]  ago.
[1631.50 --> 1631.82]  Yes.
[1631.82 --> 1636.34]  So you kind of look at it and you go, okay, well, how bad do I feel for you?
[1636.74 --> 1641.78]  Because you became a big deal when you released Far Cry and Crysis.
[1641.78 --> 1642.58]  Back to back.
[1642.58 --> 1648.44]  You were this upstart that came out of nowhere and released Far Cry, what was effectively
[1648.44 --> 1651.74]  the first, at the time, what we were calling next-gen FPS.
[1652.38 --> 1655.98]  So it was Far Cry, Doom 3, and Half-Life 2.
[1656.28 --> 1659.50]  And Far Cry was never even on the list until it came out.
[1659.98 --> 1661.34]  And people were like, what?
[1661.34 --> 1661.68]  What?
[1662.22 --> 1663.46]  Where did this come from?
[1663.66 --> 1664.44]  Literally nowhere.
[1665.22 --> 1665.74]  What?
[1665.74 --> 1668.56]  And it looked as good or better than those other games.
[1668.64 --> 1670.86]  Like, it was, they were in the same class.
[1671.18 --> 1673.06]  And then they released Crysis.
[1673.52 --> 1678.54]  And then Crysis 2 was kind of that, but, like, not as much.
[1678.62 --> 1680.12]  And then Crysis, whatever.
[1680.26 --> 1680.48]  Anyway.
[1681.10 --> 1686.56]  So they got away from their roots, which was building really demanding, open-style games.
[1686.98 --> 1688.72]  And they got kind of samey about it.
[1688.72 --> 1695.06]  And then now they did, like, a super samey, you know, Roman game as a console exclusive.
[1695.06 --> 1697.90]  And you're just kind of sitting here going, okay, well, I'm sorry you're in trouble.
[1698.48 --> 1698.76]  But.
[1699.48 --> 1700.38]  Not making them wrong.
[1700.54 --> 1701.18]  The right moves.
[1701.70 --> 1702.00]  Dog.
[1702.14 --> 1702.54]  I don't know.
[1702.68 --> 1705.74]  Like, they were all, they were all butthurt about piracy of Crysis.
[1706.00 --> 1710.16]  And so they were like, okay, well, um, you know, we're not going to do PC exclusives anymore.
[1710.68 --> 1711.40]  And then.
[1712.42 --> 1714.10]  Except that's what made your company big.
[1714.30 --> 1718.24]  So, apparently, in spite of the piracy, you were doing fine and now you're not.
[1718.24 --> 1719.22]  So, I'm not sure.
[1719.24 --> 1722.12]  I think a lot of people interpret pirate numbers very incorrectly.
[1722.92 --> 1726.38]  You can't just be like, look at all that potential money that we didn't get.
[1726.52 --> 1728.18]  We're going to write that down as a loss.
[1728.34 --> 1729.52]  That's not how that works, man.
[1730.34 --> 1731.48]  That is not how that works.
[1731.56 --> 1735.82]  A lot of those people would have never even thought of possibly buying that game in the first place.
[1735.96 --> 1740.84]  And then, honestly, a not tiny percentage of those people would have played it, thought it was cool, and then bought it.
[1741.96 --> 1743.38]  I know people that do that.
[1743.52 --> 1744.80]  I know people that do that, too.
[1744.84 --> 1746.74]  But I also know people that don't do that.
[1746.88 --> 1747.50]  I do as well.
[1747.66 --> 1747.90]  So.
[1747.90 --> 1748.92]  I know both sides.
[1749.36 --> 1751.60]  I'm just saying that those people do exist.
[1752.00 --> 1752.34]  They do exist.
[1752.34 --> 1754.52]  They're not a huge percentage, but they do exist.
[1754.82 --> 1763.46]  I think that the number of those people who think they exist versus the number of those people that actually exist is.
[1764.00 --> 1771.24]  I know a lot of people that also claim to be in that group and then finish the game and just go like, oops, guess I'm done already.
[1771.58 --> 1772.30]  I'm like, no.
[1772.64 --> 1772.88]  Yeah.
[1773.00 --> 1773.94]  That's not how that works.
[1773.94 --> 1778.40]  People are saying, I pirated it and then bought it and like, yeah, that's fine.
[1778.70 --> 1779.42]  You did.
[1779.42 --> 1787.08]  And like, pirating it on day one and then buying it when it's $2 on a Steam sale two years later is not the same.
[1789.30 --> 1790.96]  It's like, not the same at all.
[1791.86 --> 1792.84]  You know, it's funny.
[1792.96 --> 1800.12]  Actually, after last week's WAN show, when I said all that unpopular stuff about how pirates are wrong, the comments were hilarious.
[1800.12 --> 1803.08]  Because people are like, well, there's no demo.
[1803.30 --> 1804.22]  So what can we do?
[1804.76 --> 1807.28]  And on Twitter, I'm like, well, just don't play.
[1807.58 --> 1808.78]  And they're like, well, we're gamers.
[1809.28 --> 1810.24]  We can't not play.
[1811.06 --> 1813.82]  I'm like, what are you talking about?
[1814.18 --> 1818.96]  If you don't buy, if everyone just stops buying Call of Duty 18.
[1819.36 --> 1820.16]  There will be demos.
[1820.32 --> 1820.98]  There will be a demo.
[1821.54 --> 1822.88]  They will need to sell it.
[1823.08 --> 1824.16]  There will be a free weekend.
[1824.44 --> 1825.24]  There will be this.
[1825.40 --> 1826.22]  There will be that.
[1826.22 --> 1830.94]  It'll happen if you all just refuse to buy it and don't play it.
[1831.60 --> 1832.04]  Yeah.
[1832.76 --> 1835.02]  And lots of games still do have demos.
[1835.44 --> 1835.78]  And honestly.
[1836.04 --> 1838.32]  Demo those games and then buy them.
[1838.50 --> 1839.48]  Demo those games and then buy them.
[1839.58 --> 1843.82]  Steam actually has a pretty aggressive demo availability, which is pretty nice.
[1843.94 --> 1845.68]  I know when Child of Light came out.
[1845.86 --> 1846.04]  Yeah.
[1846.18 --> 1847.30]  Really interesting looking game.
[1847.34 --> 1849.42]  I was like, wow, it's kind of expensive though.
[1849.52 --> 1850.98]  And I don't really know anything about it.
[1851.04 --> 1851.72]  Oh, there's a demo.
[1852.42 --> 1854.62]  It's like full access to the game or something for three days.
[1854.62 --> 1855.48]  I was like, oh, sweet.
[1855.96 --> 1856.44]  That's cool.
[1856.52 --> 1856.74]  Awesome.
[1857.28 --> 1861.00]  And I mean, you know, the other thing too is like, and the people saying, because I think
[1861.00 --> 1861.88]  I made some analogy.
[1861.98 --> 1864.58]  I was like, well, I'm a scuba diver, but I haven't been in a few years.
[1864.70 --> 1866.40]  And people are like, well, then you're not a scuba diver.
[1866.46 --> 1867.86]  You're someone who knows how to scuba dive.
[1868.10 --> 1871.14]  You know, for me to be a gamer, I have to, I have to play the games.
[1871.14 --> 1874.84]  And I'm just kind of sitting here going, well, actually, I disagree with that because
[1874.84 --> 1879.90]  it makes gamers sound like pathetic addicts, not like people who are making a conscious
[1879.90 --> 1882.06]  decision about how they want to live their lives.
[1882.22 --> 1883.32]  And I don't think that's fair.
[1883.32 --> 1888.86]  I like to give gamers a little bit more respect than the latest AAA Battlefield comes out.
[1888.98 --> 1890.36]  They don't have to play it or they're not a gamer.
[1890.52 --> 1892.34]  And they have to play it or they're not a gamer.
[1892.42 --> 1898.02]  I know a lot of gamers that, like, I find especially in the Blizzard community, especially, but then
[1898.02 --> 1903.36]  also with games like Counter-Strike, there'll be guys that like, they're like, oh, do you
[1903.36 --> 1904.00]  want to play a game?
[1904.58 --> 1905.60]  And I'll be like, yeah, sure.
[1905.64 --> 1907.00]  This mainly happens to my brother, not me.
[1907.08 --> 1908.66]  But I'll be like, oh, do you want to play a game?
[1908.72 --> 1909.08]  Yeah, sure.
[1909.38 --> 1909.74]  Oh, okay.
[1909.86 --> 1911.50]  Oh, I don't see you on StarCraft.
[1911.50 --> 1913.56]  It's like, yeah, yeah.
[1913.66 --> 1914.40]  Do you want to play something else?
[1914.48 --> 1915.78]  They're like, no, I don't have any other games.
[1916.32 --> 1917.30]  I only play StarCraft.
[1917.44 --> 1918.14]  They're still a gamer.
[1918.68 --> 1919.66]  I see that with Counter-Strike.
[1919.74 --> 1922.00]  I see that with a lot of the competitive style games.
[1922.36 --> 1922.44]  Yeah.
[1922.44 --> 1924.52]  They'll like only be into that one.
[1925.20 --> 1926.12]  That's fine.
[1926.24 --> 1927.12]  That doesn't mean they're not a gamer.
[1927.36 --> 1927.54]  Yeah.
[1927.54 --> 1929.36]  All right.
[1929.48 --> 1930.72]  So this is exciting.
[1931.38 --> 1937.62]  25 gigabit and 50 gigabit Ethernet standards being worked on.
[1937.72 --> 1942.02]  So a consortium has been formed, which actually has some pretty big names.
[1942.14 --> 1943.56]  So I would expect this to go somewhere.
[1943.70 --> 1946.52]  Microsoft, Google, Broadcom.
[1947.44 --> 1948.16]  Kind of a big deal.
[1948.36 --> 1948.62]  Yeah.
[1948.74 --> 1950.52]  So this is probably going to happen.
[1950.52 --> 1956.22]  But basically the objective here is this is not going to make its way to your desktop anytime soon.
[1956.54 --> 1956.60]  No.
[1957.34 --> 1959.52]  Like probably eventually, but not now.
[1960.34 --> 1960.56]  Yeah.
[1960.58 --> 1961.52]  Not for a long time.
[1961.58 --> 1963.32]  I mean, look how long we've been stuck with gigabit.
[1963.82 --> 1964.26]  Oh God.
[1964.30 --> 1965.56]  We haven't even moved to 10 gigabit.
[1966.10 --> 1967.60]  So there's that.
[1967.60 --> 1972.40]  But this is basically going to be for, as a tweener.
[1972.58 --> 1974.46]  Because right now we've got 100 gigabit.
[1974.52 --> 1975.16]  Let me ask you this.
[1975.30 --> 1975.86]  And then we've got.
[1975.86 --> 1978.52]  Why is it that you know you show someone a photo?
[1978.80 --> 1979.98]  What the heck is that?
[1980.38 --> 1981.36]  And they flip to see what's next.
[1981.42 --> 1984.86]  I don't want any phone flippers flipping through all my pictures.
[1984.86 --> 1986.50]  Where did this ad come from?
[1987.58 --> 1988.02]  Tweaktown.
[1988.64 --> 1989.32]  Yeah, Tweaktown.
[1989.62 --> 1989.88]  Yeah.
[1989.98 --> 1992.70]  I had a Tweaktown article open on the computer there.
[1992.76 --> 1992.90]  Yeah.
[1992.94 --> 1994.38]  No, Tweaktown's like the worst for that.
[1994.48 --> 1995.18]  Out of nowhere.
[1995.42 --> 1995.58]  Yeah.
[1995.58 --> 1997.30]  Oh, I never have sound on on my computer.
[1997.30 --> 1998.40]  So it never bothers me.
[1998.68 --> 1999.88]  Tweaktown always does that.
[1999.98 --> 2001.80]  Never leave Tweaktown at times open.
[2002.38 --> 2004.56]  It's like the one site where it's like, oh God.
[2005.00 --> 2010.02]  Anyway, this is supposed to exist as a tweener between the 100 gigabit gear, that like super
[2010.02 --> 2014.14]  high-end enterprise stuff, and then the 10 gigabit gear, which is that also high-end,
[2014.24 --> 2017.16]  but not as completely balls to the walls, 10 gigabit stuff.
[2017.16 --> 2018.36]  What was that ad?
[2019.06 --> 2020.02]  Oh, I don't know what it was.
[2020.76 --> 2021.10]  Oh.
[2021.98 --> 2022.34]  Anyway.
[2023.92 --> 2026.16]  I think that's pretty much all there is to say about that.
[2026.16 --> 2027.44]  It's not exactly the most complicated.
[2027.52 --> 2029.76]  If you have some other stuff that you want to talk about, then great.
[2030.02 --> 2030.28]  Not really.
[2030.66 --> 2031.58]  It's exciting.
[2032.34 --> 2036.90]  It's more looking for server backend and linking things together within data centers and stuff
[2036.90 --> 2037.26]  like that.
[2037.32 --> 2039.26]  So it's not really home stuff.
[2039.44 --> 2042.10]  So your Dropbox might go faster.
[2042.58 --> 2043.24]  Probably not.
[2043.30 --> 2043.90]  Probably not, though.
[2043.90 --> 2048.34]  But yeah, nothing that you guys will probably actually, or us, will probably actually feel
[2048.34 --> 2049.26]  the effects of, really.
[2049.56 --> 2050.64]  It'll improve efficiency.
[2051.22 --> 2054.94]  Prices will go down in the long term for cloud-based solutions, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[2054.94 --> 2055.70]  blah, all that stuff.
[2055.80 --> 2057.58]  But in the short term, not a whole lot.
[2057.58 --> 2062.14]  And we're not expecting any kind of technology based on these standards to hit any time in
[2062.14 --> 2064.26]  the next year to a year and a half anyway.
[2064.68 --> 2069.98]  It's interesting that the plans to create this, blah, blah, blah, were stalled at a meeting
[2069.98 --> 2071.80]  last March due to perceived lack of support.
[2072.14 --> 2075.08]  And then Google, Microsoft, and Broadcom were like, nope.
[2076.62 --> 2077.76]  Time to do it.
[2078.06 --> 2078.24]  Yeah.
[2078.26 --> 2079.38]  We actually need this, yo.
[2079.66 --> 2079.90]  Yeah.
[2080.12 --> 2081.04]  It's cool that they're doing that.
[2081.12 --> 2081.68]  I like it a lot.
[2081.68 --> 2086.44]  Okay, so this is actually pretty crappy.
[2086.46 --> 2088.20]  Have you been to Linux LiveJournal lately?
[2088.62 --> 2089.48]  Yeah, exactly.
[2089.76 --> 2090.22]  Because I have.
[2090.52 --> 2095.44]  All right, so here's an open letter from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[2095.78 --> 2098.34]  Dear NSA, privacy is a fundamental right.
[2099.44 --> 2100.82]  And you know what?
[2101.84 --> 2108.14]  This is, I mean, every time, every time we talk about the NSA, they're crossing a new line.
[2108.14 --> 2114.02]  But basically, what the NSA has been found to be doing this time is they're actually adding
[2114.02 --> 2117.08]  fingerprints to your online activities.
[2117.28 --> 2123.58]  So even though you might be using Tor Browser, so it's difficult to track exactly what you're
[2123.58 --> 2125.72]  looking at and exactly what you're doing online.
[2125.98 --> 2133.94]  What they're doing is they're putting together the puzzle pieces of the people who are accessing
[2133.94 --> 2139.00]  things like Tor Browser, and then they're building profiles of these people and turning them
[2139.00 --> 2144.74]  into sort of, I don't want to say flagged, because it's not quite that extreme, but they're
[2144.74 --> 2149.92]  turning these into profiles for these individuals that could put you under more scrutiny if you
[2149.92 --> 2152.58]  are attempting to maintain your privacy.
[2153.92 --> 2156.70]  It's just like, will this arms race never end?
[2157.06 --> 2157.78]  No, probably not.
[2158.14 --> 2158.58]  I know.
[2158.58 --> 2163.18]  What I find interesting is I've seen a whole bunch of, like, not to slam America, but
[2163.18 --> 2164.84]  I'm about to slam America a little bit.
[2165.26 --> 2166.16]  Be nice to America.
[2166.26 --> 2167.16]  They're much bigger than us.
[2167.20 --> 2168.30]  I'm partially American.
[2168.54 --> 2168.90]  I know.
[2169.10 --> 2169.64]  That's gross.
[2169.72 --> 2170.52]  Can I slam myself?
[2170.84 --> 2171.94]  I'm just teasing you.
[2173.12 --> 2173.56]  Okay.
[2173.94 --> 2179.42]  Actually, so Luke is legitimately half American, if you wanted to calculate it that way.
[2179.52 --> 2181.00]  So go ahead and do your American.
[2181.06 --> 2181.64]  Your mom's American.
[2181.98 --> 2183.66]  Yeah, but I'm technically fully American.
[2183.98 --> 2185.20]  I'm just also fully Canadian.
[2185.38 --> 2187.54]  You can't be fully American and fully Canadian.
[2187.54 --> 2189.30]  There's citizenship in both countries.
[2189.42 --> 2191.78]  Dual citizenship is half citizenship, man.
[2192.10 --> 2192.50]  What?
[2192.66 --> 2193.64]  Yeah, you're half Canadian.
[2193.86 --> 2194.30]  I'm sorry.
[2194.50 --> 2194.84]  No, no.
[2195.08 --> 2196.04]  That's not how that works.
[2196.08 --> 2198.98]  You know what's funny is in Canada, you're right.
[2199.06 --> 2199.96]  That's not how it works.
[2200.22 --> 2201.10]  You're completely right.
[2201.18 --> 2201.66]  In America.
[2201.96 --> 2202.68]  But no, no, no.
[2202.70 --> 2203.72]  In America, it's not really.
[2203.90 --> 2207.10]  Actually, they do make you be fully American when you.
[2207.42 --> 2209.46]  So anyway, that actually is kind of how it works.
[2209.46 --> 2215.94]  In a lot of parts of the world, though, the way that people view your nationality actually
[2215.94 --> 2219.76]  has a lot more to do with your lineage and a lot less to do with where you're born and
[2219.76 --> 2220.18]  where you're from.
[2220.34 --> 2224.62]  So me saying, me calling you half American probably makes perfect sense to our European
[2224.62 --> 2225.04]  viewers.
[2225.78 --> 2233.20]  Where you're half Irish, even if your dad and mom spent their entire lives in France.
[2233.56 --> 2236.92]  If they're of Irish descent, you're half Irish, even though you've never set foot in Ireland.
[2238.14 --> 2241.58]  I've heard that reference, too, but only when people are specifically talking about
[2241.58 --> 2242.18]  So you're half American.
[2242.72 --> 2243.50]  Whatever, man.
[2244.02 --> 2247.58]  I mean, this is good in this case because you're about to say something mean.
[2247.60 --> 2249.06]  Because I can slam myself a little bit.
[2249.58 --> 2250.74]  The 4th of July.
[2251.66 --> 2252.18]  What about it?
[2252.30 --> 2256.88]  I see tons of people celebrating and they're like, yeah, the meaning of being American is
[2256.88 --> 2260.88]  like, you stand up for what you think is right to no matter what the odds, no matter
[2260.88 --> 2263.40]  what's against you, blah, blah, blah, because America.
[2263.82 --> 2266.68]  Even if it's like against your government, whatever, whatever, you do it for yourself.
[2266.80 --> 2267.76]  You do blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2267.80 --> 2269.34]  And they're all like, yeah, we're awesome.
[2269.54 --> 2271.02]  And I'm like, yeah, that's cool America.
[2271.14 --> 2272.44]  You're not cool America right now.
[2273.22 --> 2273.80]  You're not.
[2275.72 --> 2277.46]  Like, it's just, nope.
[2277.72 --> 2279.96]  And it's not any individual's fault.
[2280.14 --> 2280.58]  I don't think.
[2280.86 --> 2282.60]  It's just things are kind of crappy down there.
[2282.66 --> 2289.18]  Okay, so the really horrible thing about this whole latest NSA thing is not only are they
[2289.18 --> 2292.60]  looking at people who are using Tor browser.
[2293.18 --> 2298.90]  They are looking at, apparently, Linux Journal is one of the publications that is getting
[2298.90 --> 2299.88]  you fingerprinted.
[2300.76 --> 2301.36]  Really?
[2301.76 --> 2302.56]  Linux Journal?
[2303.22 --> 2311.76]  Just because someone has a passion for open source operating system kernels, does that really
[2311.76 --> 2312.18]  mean that...
[2312.18 --> 2318.52]  To play completely devil's advocate, because I think it's completely bull crap, but they
[2318.52 --> 2323.44]  do talk about stuff like Tor and stuff like, what are they called?
[2324.00 --> 2325.08]  Tails a lot.
[2325.14 --> 2325.36]  Sure.
[2325.64 --> 2325.78]  Okay.
[2325.98 --> 2331.68]  So Tails is an operating system that basically leaves no trace on the computer that you were
[2331.68 --> 2332.30]  running it on.
[2332.36 --> 2335.34]  So you can run it on an SD card or a USB drive or even a live CD.
[2335.34 --> 2342.16]  Um, and, you know, yes, these technologies, Tor and Tails, do exist for the purpose of hiding
[2342.16 --> 2342.82]  your tracks.
[2343.28 --> 2348.58]  And yes, Linux Journal does talk about these things, but that doesn't make them an extremist
[2348.58 --> 2349.00]  forum.
[2349.72 --> 2349.82]  No.
[2350.96 --> 2351.62]  Not at all.
[2351.62 --> 2352.12]  And that's insane.
[2352.26 --> 2352.40]  Yeah.
[2352.60 --> 2353.50]  It's completely insane.
[2353.52 --> 2355.80]  I can't even devil's advocate that, because that's ridiculous.
[2356.42 --> 2357.44]  So, you know what?
[2357.48 --> 2358.98]  I want to do a Twitter blitz right now.
[2358.98 --> 2362.18]  It looks like they are now, because there's stuff on their front page, like, are you an extremist
[2362.18 --> 2362.84]  and all that kind of stuff.
[2362.96 --> 2364.32]  Well, they're joking about it, right?
[2364.34 --> 2368.02]  I know, but like, if you had no prior knowledge, it would look like they might be now.
[2368.40 --> 2374.02]  So here's, here's what, uh, here's what I kind of want to do, just for, for the lols,
[2374.04 --> 2374.22]  guys.
[2374.34 --> 2379.46]  I want you guys to Twitter blitz us examples of, no, not straw poll.
[2379.64 --> 2379.84]  Okay.
[2379.88 --> 2380.96]  I want to Twitter blitz this.
[2380.96 --> 2387.56]  So I want you guys to Twitter blitz us examples of, you know, privacy that you think people
[2387.56 --> 2392.78]  should have that they're not allowed to have, like the ability to browse websites without
[2392.78 --> 2398.42]  people going through their internet history, and privacy that people have that you don't
[2398.42 --> 2399.50]  think they should have.
[2399.58 --> 2404.24]  I mean, hot button topics like this include things like, uh, gun ownership registry, for
[2404.24 --> 2404.64]  example.
[2404.94 --> 2407.40]  So I just want to hear you guys' opinions.
[2407.74 --> 2410.40]  We're not going to be like, okay, yeah, you're right, you're wrong.
[2410.64 --> 2415.84]  But the thing about privacy is that there are, there are places you have to draw the line.
[2415.84 --> 2418.68]  Like, for example, okay, so let's say anonymity on the internet.
[2419.00 --> 2421.74]  Should you be allowed to be anonymous in certain places?
[2423.34 --> 2426.16]  For example, you can walk around on the street with sunglasses.
[2426.54 --> 2430.04]  You walk into a bank with sunglasses and your hat pulled down to here.
[2430.22 --> 2430.84]  That's a problem.
[2432.98 --> 2433.86]  Just think about it.
[2435.00 --> 2436.18]  Just think about it for a second.
[2436.26 --> 2438.22]  Which are not the same at all.
[2438.54 --> 2439.64]  Which are not the same at all.
[2439.72 --> 2440.56]  The bank and the internet.
[2440.74 --> 2441.24]  It doesn't matter.
[2441.86 --> 2443.78]  I'm, well, I'm not talking about just the internet and the bank.
[2443.90 --> 2445.14]  They're like wildly different.
[2445.14 --> 2446.00]  Yeah, I know.
[2446.42 --> 2447.32]  That's the whole point.
[2447.40 --> 2448.80]  People are supposed to just tweet things.
[2449.20 --> 2449.26]  Okay.
[2449.40 --> 2453.90]  Okay, so like, for example, you are allowed to draw the shades over your house.
[2454.26 --> 2460.28]  But if you were to set up a 25 foot high wall around your property, that would raise eyebrows.
[2460.62 --> 2462.44]  You know, you've got building code or whatever else.
[2462.44 --> 2464.08]  But basically, you're not going to be allowed to do that.
[2464.22 --> 2464.24]  I was just going to say that.
[2464.24 --> 2465.16]  That's more of a problem for other reasons.
[2465.42 --> 2465.58]  Yeah.
[2466.10 --> 2466.22]  So.
[2466.22 --> 2471.72]  We have, like, at my parents' house where I grew up, we had these giant freaking trees.
[2471.98 --> 2472.14]  Yeah.
[2472.14 --> 2472.80]  No one cared.
[2473.04 --> 2474.10]  They're a lot more than 25 feet.
[2474.10 --> 2475.92]  We have a lot of them.
[2476.04 --> 2476.24]  Okay.
[2476.42 --> 2479.78]  Like, things that I don't think should necessarily be allowed.
[2480.98 --> 2483.62]  Extremely dangerous animals that aren't correctly contained.
[2484.18 --> 2486.90]  I mean, people would argue, well, that's my privacy.
[2487.06 --> 2487.90]  That's my security.
[2488.08 --> 2489.14]  I'm protecting my privacy.
[2489.66 --> 2494.08]  But, you know, you see enough stories in the news about these dogs getting out, mauling children.
[2494.30 --> 2494.46]  Dogs?
[2494.46 --> 2495.08]  That it becomes a problem.
[2495.38 --> 2495.56]  Yeah.
[2495.82 --> 2496.38]  What dog?
[2496.50 --> 2497.30]  What do you mean, what dogs?
[2497.38 --> 2497.78]  Bulldogs?
[2497.96 --> 2498.36]  Dobermans?
[2498.58 --> 2499.16]  Extremely dangerous animals.
[2499.16 --> 2499.78]  That's bad training.
[2499.78 --> 2500.22]  Yeah.
[2501.66 --> 2503.32]  I completely disagree on that topic.
[2503.32 --> 2504.04]  So you disagree.
[2504.24 --> 2505.84]  So having a dangerous animal.
[2506.00 --> 2506.06]  A bulldog?
[2506.06 --> 2508.32]  I mean, when I say dangerous animal, I don't mean a breed.
[2508.86 --> 2509.94]  You said dog, though.
[2510.04 --> 2510.24]  Yeah.
[2510.50 --> 2514.66]  A dog is an example of an animal that can be dangerous if you train it to be dangerous.
[2515.00 --> 2515.30]  Okay.
[2515.74 --> 2515.98]  Yeah.
[2515.98 --> 2518.24]  Having a dog isn't the objection here.
[2518.48 --> 2519.92]  The objection is fortifying your house.
[2519.98 --> 2523.68]  So, for example, where I used to live, we had a drug dealer family living across the road.
[2524.06 --> 2524.30]  Ugh.
[2524.58 --> 2526.58]  Their animals were friggin' dangerous.
[2527.56 --> 2528.76]  They were dangerous.
[2529.00 --> 2530.02]  So training a dog.
[2530.02 --> 2531.30]  Not because they're a dog.
[2531.42 --> 2532.82]  So training a dog to be dangerous.
[2533.28 --> 2533.46]  Yeah.
[2533.60 --> 2534.32]  So the point is...
[2534.32 --> 2534.86]  How do you measure that?
[2534.96 --> 2535.76]  How do you measure that?
[2535.88 --> 2536.08]  Yeah.
[2536.14 --> 2536.84]  That's not the point.
[2537.12 --> 2539.82]  The point is just, guys, what do you think is right?
[2539.86 --> 2540.52]  What do you think is wrong?
[2540.52 --> 2544.70]  Because there are things that I don't think people should be able to do for the sake of privacy.
[2544.70 --> 2553.32]  I think putting a moat around your house and putting, like, starving dogs between the moat and your front door is dangerous and wrong.
[2553.52 --> 2555.60]  Even if it's for the sake of your own privacy.
[2555.74 --> 2557.44]  I think you're allowed to put a moat around your house if you want.
[2557.62 --> 2558.02]  You're...
[2558.02 --> 2558.96]  Probably not, actually.
[2559.10 --> 2560.04]  I think it depends where you live.
[2560.16 --> 2560.86]  Call before you dig.
[2560.94 --> 2561.54]  BC1 call.
[2562.26 --> 2562.52]  Yeah.
[2562.70 --> 2563.04]  No, I know.
[2563.28 --> 2564.26]  But, like, if you can...
[2564.26 --> 2567.24]  I think if you don't hit something, you'd technically be allowed.
[2567.40 --> 2569.32]  I don't think you can put a moat around your house.
[2569.48 --> 2569.76]  Really?
[2569.90 --> 2570.48]  I'm fairly sure.
[2570.48 --> 2573.84]  If you had, like, a giant farm property and your house was in the middle of the property,
[2573.84 --> 2575.80]  you couldn't moat your house?
[2575.88 --> 2576.24]  Why not?
[2576.98 --> 2577.54]  I just...
[2577.54 --> 2579.16]  I just don't think you can.
[2579.30 --> 2579.98]  You can...
[2579.98 --> 2580.26]  You can...
[2580.26 --> 2582.34]  Okay, in suburbia, you definitely can't.
[2582.36 --> 2582.58]  No.
[2582.72 --> 2583.64]  Because you're gonna hit something.
[2583.74 --> 2586.30]  I can't even paint my house a certain color.
[2586.74 --> 2587.86]  That's so dumb.
[2587.92 --> 2588.10]  Yeah.
[2589.16 --> 2589.64]  That's...
[2589.64 --> 2590.38]  That's how it works.
[2590.64 --> 2591.38]  I hate that.
[2591.58 --> 2595.94]  We wouldn't even, like, here, we wouldn't even have enough room to cut a moat around.
[2596.46 --> 2596.90]  Well, yeah.
[2597.46 --> 2597.86]  All right.
[2597.86 --> 2598.72]  It's not even possible.
[2600.10 --> 2603.12]  SpamJazz says, I think the rules of the real world should be applied to the internet.
[2603.38 --> 2604.58]  It should be treated as a place.
[2606.30 --> 2611.56]  Igor figures if it affects someone else, then privacy is not protected.
[2611.68 --> 2615.44]  If it's a personal preference or something like that, then basically do whatever you want.
[2615.50 --> 2619.28]  I mean, an example of that is the fact that you're not allowed to tint your windshield
[2619.28 --> 2620.62]  here in BC.
[2621.04 --> 2621.10]  Yeah.
[2621.10 --> 2626.08]  Someone could say, well, for the sake of my privacy, I want my entire car tinted completely black.
[2626.40 --> 2627.68]  You can do the back, I think.
[2627.74 --> 2629.64]  You can do the back very dark, but not black.
[2629.82 --> 2630.72]  There are still regulations.
[2631.22 --> 2635.08]  And the reason for that is that pedestrians need to be able to see where the driver's looking.
[2635.44 --> 2638.00]  So it's one of those things where where is the line?
[2638.08 --> 2642.56]  Because there are places where I don't think you just plain old have the right to not be
[2642.56 --> 2643.38]  seen or heard by anyone.
[2644.10 --> 2646.32]  Like, for example, not being able to tint your windshield.
[2646.32 --> 2646.88]  I'm sorry.
[2646.96 --> 2649.04]  You just can't do that because it's dangerous for others.
[2649.14 --> 2649.50]  That's all.
[2649.76 --> 2650.68]  But that's like in public.
[2650.68 --> 2652.64]  You can tint the windows on your house.
[2653.24 --> 2654.66]  You can put blackout on the windows in your house.
[2654.82 --> 2656.88]  I wonder if you could in certain...
[2656.88 --> 2658.82]  Again, you can't even paint your house certain colors.
[2658.96 --> 2660.18]  I wonder if you're allowed to...
[2660.18 --> 2661.30]  Right, but you could blackout blind your house.
[2661.40 --> 2662.56]  You could blackout blind your house.
[2662.72 --> 2664.74]  Well, not technically the same thing, but close enough.
[2665.64 --> 2668.02]  But then again, and oh, this is interesting.
[2668.50 --> 2673.98]  If you were to blackout blind your house, put a 25-foot tall fence around it, put video
[2673.98 --> 2679.56]  surveillance cameras around it, would you then be surprised if the cops took an interest
[2679.56 --> 2680.06]  in your house?
[2680.06 --> 2680.56]  No.
[2680.56 --> 2687.14]  Is the NSA any different for taking an interest in people who go to great lengths to protect
[2687.14 --> 2689.58]  their privacy than the traditional law enforcement?
[2689.58 --> 2691.56]  But the cops are allowed to take as much interest as they want.
[2691.64 --> 2692.88]  They can't enter your house without a warrant.
[2693.32 --> 2693.62]  Yes.
[2693.62 --> 2697.20]  But the NSA is not necessarily entering your house if they're...
[2697.20 --> 2697.76]  Yes, they are.
[2697.76 --> 2697.88]  Yes, they are.
[2697.88 --> 2699.24]  Because they're intercepting your traffic.
[2699.56 --> 2700.70]  So hold on a second.
[2701.34 --> 2706.02]  So how would they take an interest without intercepting your traffic?
[2706.94 --> 2709.80]  Without infringing on your rights in the first place?
[2710.20 --> 2712.06]  See, that's why this is also very interesting.
[2712.18 --> 2712.88]  But screw them.
[2712.92 --> 2713.46]  Who cares?
[2713.94 --> 2717.10]  Put my name on a list and then do nothing with it because you suck.
[2717.24 --> 2718.08]  Back off.
[2718.08 --> 2724.08]  All right, so Caleb says, I believe that sites don't have the right to mine data from users
[2724.08 --> 2724.76]  to sell for a profit.
[2724.88 --> 2726.66]  Not really the topic we're talking about.
[2726.70 --> 2727.94]  Yeah, no, not at all.
[2728.02 --> 2729.14]  And they kind of do.
[2729.64 --> 2729.90]  Yeah.
[2730.86 --> 2731.30]  Okay.
[2731.56 --> 2736.24]  And in fact, if you read the terms of service of the sites that you use, it's very likely
[2736.24 --> 2739.30]  that they tell you that they can use your data for whatever they want.
[2739.52 --> 2741.66]  That's like the Facebook thing that happened with the social experiment.
[2741.66 --> 2746.42]  And then Facebook was like, well, in terms of agreement, it literally says you're going
[2746.42 --> 2747.50]  to take part in this.
[2747.90 --> 2748.72]  So there you go.
[2749.04 --> 2752.92]  You should be able to look at whatever sites you want, just not what they want you to look
[2752.92 --> 2753.76]  at, but to a point.
[2754.08 --> 2757.80]  I mean, I think something that was really, that was something that the article brought
[2757.80 --> 2760.24]  up that was yet another facet of this.
[2760.66 --> 2763.82]  Just the point of this whole conversation is just think about it, guys.
[2764.18 --> 2769.50]  I'm not, nothing I say is necessarily me being like, yes, the NSA is right, or this
[2769.50 --> 2771.02]  is wrong, or this is right, or whatever else.
[2771.02 --> 2775.98]  The point is just to think about it because think about the people who might legitimately need
[2775.98 --> 2778.40]  the privacy that something like Tails affords them.
[2778.46 --> 2784.98]  People who are not in America, even, where they have relative freedom, and at least the
[2784.98 --> 2787.42]  police mostly can't just shoot them.
[2788.82 --> 2793.36]  You know, where they're trying to fight against a truly oppressive government, and now all of
[2793.36 --> 2797.98]  a sudden, the NSA is collecting this data, sharing it with who knows who, and now that
[2797.98 --> 2802.00]  could put them in danger just because they're trying to protect their privacy that they legitimately
[2802.00 --> 2802.88]  needed to protect.
[2802.88 --> 2803.14]  Yeah.
[2804.14 --> 2807.66]  So you need to be able to look at whatever, say, okay, you need to rephrase the dog sentence
[2807.66 --> 2808.06]  a bit better.
[2808.12 --> 2809.06]  I think we handled that.
[2809.60 --> 2810.88]  The point is dangerous dogs.
[2811.70 --> 2814.12]  I'm not saying that a particular breed is dangerous.
[2814.34 --> 2816.64]  I'm saying a particular dog could be dangerous.
[2817.06 --> 2818.64]  Yeah, and that's, and that is true.
[2818.74 --> 2820.08]  And you can usually tell.
[2820.26 --> 2824.68]  It's usually fairly obvious which ones have been told that strangers are bad.
[2825.22 --> 2825.40]  Yeah.
[2825.62 --> 2827.10]  Not always, but you're, you're right.
[2827.34 --> 2830.48]  They'll have, especially if you're trained in being able to look for those things.
[2830.48 --> 2832.06]  That would be like body language.
[2832.50 --> 2833.84]  Dogs don't really hide body language.
[2834.02 --> 2834.80]  No, they don't.
[2836.06 --> 2837.76]  Anonymity should be everywhere on the web.
[2837.84 --> 2842.06]  It's like saying you can't blend into a crowd, which is another really interesting point that
[2842.06 --> 2847.52]  the article raises, and that's that the best thing that we can all do if we don't want
[2847.52 --> 2851.50]  to stand out as someone who uses Tor is we should just all use Tor.
[2851.50 --> 2855.86]  Because if you, by tracking everyone, you track no one.
[2856.60 --> 2859.36]  Or by singling out everyone, you single out no one.
[2859.56 --> 2860.30]  There you go.
[2860.36 --> 2860.60]  Whatever.
[2861.32 --> 2862.46]  I was like, wait a second.
[2862.74 --> 2867.44]  Well, by tracking everyone, I guess what I meant is one of those individuals is not as
[2867.44 --> 2869.22]  easily or as accurately tracked.
[2869.40 --> 2870.28]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[2870.28 --> 2875.44]  In Europe, the policy about using credit cards for transactions.
[2877.24 --> 2877.64]  What?
[2877.80 --> 2878.06]  Okay.
[2878.64 --> 2881.54]  I should be allowed to control what companies can and cannot view your data.
[2881.78 --> 2882.00]  Yeah.
[2882.20 --> 2883.52]  We're not talking about companies, though.
[2883.56 --> 2884.46]  We're talking about the NSA.
[2884.66 --> 2884.84]  Yeah.
[2885.04 --> 2885.80]  We're not really a company.
[2886.78 --> 2889.12]  Why does Slick have a phase load on his shirt?
[2889.50 --> 2890.54]  We'll cover that later.
[2890.60 --> 2891.22]  Yeah, I talked about that.
[2891.36 --> 2892.78]  Yeah, we're on this.
[2892.82 --> 2894.12]  And I told him the exact same thing.
[2894.24 --> 2895.06]  You'll find out later.
[2896.88 --> 2899.30]  I don't want the government taking my phone without a warrant.
[2899.30 --> 2900.48]  Oh, right.
[2900.54 --> 2902.84]  People are just giving a couple examples of things.
[2902.98 --> 2903.10]  Yeah.
[2903.96 --> 2905.30]  Yeah, that's something that...
[2905.30 --> 2906.58]  I think that's becoming a thing, isn't it?
[2906.78 --> 2908.54]  Yeah, that's becoming a bit of a problem.
[2908.96 --> 2915.16]  And, like, I mean, even going back a number of years ago, people were having laptops seized
[2915.16 --> 2917.30]  at the border to check for pirated software.
[2917.62 --> 2917.78]  Yeah.
[2917.88 --> 2922.72]  So, like, that's been a thing for a while and is totally over the line from my perspective.
[2922.92 --> 2923.16]  Yeah.
[2924.14 --> 2925.32]  It's my laptop, man.
[2925.54 --> 2928.22]  Privacy question up to the property owner says,
[2928.22 --> 2931.34]  so whoever owns the property should be able to just do whatever they want there.
[2931.70 --> 2933.74]  While using the internet, we're totally free.
[2934.06 --> 2937.28]  But, like in real life, everyone should set limits for internet use.
[2937.96 --> 2941.74]  I think Twitter is not a great medium for this.
[2941.94 --> 2942.12]  No.
[2942.18 --> 2943.94]  Because I just mostly don't...
[2943.94 --> 2944.40]  Understand.
[2944.60 --> 2945.48]  Understand things.
[2945.82 --> 2947.56]  Actually, Christopher Rivera...
[2947.56 --> 2947.86]  You know what?
[2947.86 --> 2950.14]  We'll use this as a transition into our next topic here.
[2950.14 --> 2952.86]  This is...
[2952.86 --> 2953.62]  This is interesting.
[2954.48 --> 2955.66]  Doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop.
[2955.66 --> 2956.60]  Where did that one go?
[2956.72 --> 2957.20]  I don't know.
[2957.28 --> 2959.26]  A lot of them got dumped in rapid fire, so check there.
[2960.02 --> 2960.38]  Okay.
[2961.02 --> 2961.62]  What are you looking for?
[2961.72 --> 2962.66]  The anonymity...
[2963.40 --> 2964.80]  I'm looking for the right to be forgotten.
[2964.96 --> 2965.08]  Right to be forgotten.
[2965.08 --> 2965.70]  Yeah, this is interesting.
[2966.30 --> 2968.92]  So, in Europe right now...
[2968.92 --> 2971.12]  Let's just go ahead and switch over to my screen here.
[2973.86 --> 2976.26]  So, the EU's right to be forgotten.
[2976.44 --> 2979.80]  So, there are some Guardian articles that have been hidden by Google.
[2980.24 --> 2982.74]  So, the Guardian is a UK-based publication.
[2983.28 --> 2993.00]  And, basically, what you are allowed to do now over there is you are allowed to have the right to not be searchable.
[2993.00 --> 3000.16]  So, you can actually request that Google no longer return search results for a particular thing.
[3000.24 --> 3006.04]  So, an example of this might be, you know, someone who had a run-in with the police or whatever else.
[3006.14 --> 3010.70]  They weren't a minor, so their name and their face and everything was published in articles.
[3011.00 --> 3021.10]  They can't make the Guardian remove their article, but they can request that Google no longer return search results linking to that article.
[3021.10 --> 3023.98]  So, you're someone who's, like, the newspaper collector.
[3024.70 --> 3026.80]  You could have that site stored somewhere.
[3026.88 --> 3028.10]  You could have that URL stored somewhere.
[3028.34 --> 3028.52]  Yes.
[3028.52 --> 3032.26]  And, that's not going to necessarily go away, but it's not going to be, like, easily researchable anymore.
[3032.74 --> 3036.86]  So, that actually seems to raise a whole other set of problems.
[3036.90 --> 3040.30]  Because I can see reasons why this should exist.
[3040.30 --> 3047.76]  You know, you don't want, I mean, you don't want your employability affected by some stupid parking ticket you got when you were 19.
[3048.20 --> 3051.74]  Or, if someone makes an accusation against you, which ends up being completely false.
[3052.00 --> 3058.02]  But, all those articles from before the verdict exist, and no one ever updates that stuff.
[3058.08 --> 3058.24]  Yeah.
[3058.42 --> 3062.30]  I mean, I can see that being the kind of thing that really should be removed.
[3063.70 --> 3064.96]  That's a huge problem.
[3064.96 --> 3081.14]  But, on the other hand, if, let's say you're a politician who's involved in scandal after scandal after scandal, and your local constituents can't search for information about it because you just go, okay, well, I don't want to be searchable.
[3081.38 --> 3082.92]  And, that's probably an extreme example.
[3083.38 --> 3084.62]  Like, let's say not a politician.
[3085.02 --> 3090.26]  Let's say, you know, an executive within a company instead.
[3090.74 --> 3096.22]  Where the other, the board of directors might want to, you know, have a look at what kind of guy is this.
[3096.30 --> 3101.36]  I mean, searching for people on the internet, whether, whatever you like about it or dislike about it.
[3101.44 --> 3102.96]  Then again, Google's just easy.
[3103.30 --> 3106.70]  Most of these websites, like, oh, that's a Google custom search.
[3106.86 --> 3107.92]  Not a good example.
[3108.24 --> 3108.38]  Yeah.
[3108.62 --> 3112.16]  The Guardian's on-site search is actually powered by Google.
[3112.30 --> 3113.88]  I wonder, oh, okay, we're in the way.
[3114.10 --> 3114.50]  It's covering it.
[3114.50 --> 3116.02]  I wonder how long that's going to last for.
[3116.62 --> 3120.28]  Yeah, but, yeah, but, like, a lot of these sites are going to have their own search functionality.
[3120.46 --> 3124.66]  So, if you try it a little bit harder, you could probably still figure it out.
[3124.72 --> 3126.74]  And, especially in situations where it's a politician.
[3127.22 --> 3127.80]  Yeah, or.
[3127.82 --> 3130.64]  Someone's probably going to try and run slander campaigns against them anyway.
[3130.76 --> 3134.50]  So, they'll hire an investigator or they'll just go to these websites themselves.
[3134.82 --> 3135.30]  It's not.
[3135.80 --> 3139.64]  But, what it's doing is it's making the information less accessible to the average person.
[3139.76 --> 3140.64]  Yes, definitely.
[3140.64 --> 3147.74]  But then the flip side of that is should my employability be affected by, you know, here's an example.
[3148.10 --> 3150.44]  Should my employability be affected by a DUI?
[3150.44 --> 3153.16]  I.
[3153.96 --> 3156.02]  You could dance all day on that topic.
[3156.16 --> 3156.44]  Yeah.
[3156.44 --> 3158.70]  I don't know.
[3159.36 --> 3160.20]  I don't drink.
[3160.28 --> 3161.68]  So, I can easily just be like, yup.
[3161.80 --> 3162.80]  But then I don't know if that's.
[3162.86 --> 3163.58]  I don't drink either.
[3163.76 --> 3168.96]  So, I could easily just be like, you know, yeah, people who get behind the wheel drunk are bad people.
[3169.32 --> 3172.86]  But, the reality of it is, sometimes good people make bad decisions.
[3172.86 --> 3177.56]  And sometimes there's going to be a flag that was raised that maybe shouldn't have.
[3177.64 --> 3178.46]  Like, what is it?
[3178.60 --> 3183.06]  I know with steroids, if you eat too many sesame seeds, you can get brought up on a steroid test.
[3183.12 --> 3186.80]  Yeah, I think they've pretty much nailed down figuring out how drunk people are.
[3187.04 --> 3187.80]  But, I see your point.
[3187.82 --> 3191.20]  I have zero experience with getting on breathalyzers or anything.
[3191.26 --> 3196.34]  I mean, if you eat a lot of poppy seed muffins, you can show up positive for opium.
[3197.04 --> 3197.58]  Is that an example?
[3197.82 --> 3198.04]  Yeah.
[3198.04 --> 3202.36]  So, yes, there are things that could be problems here.
[3202.70 --> 3207.80]  But, you know, I mean, there's a lot of debate going on in the Twitch chat right now.
[3207.98 --> 3209.68]  People deserve a second chance.
[3209.96 --> 3211.28]  People are basically bad.
[3211.32 --> 3213.28]  And we should document the bad things they do forever.
[3214.22 --> 3218.38]  I mean, it's one of those things that never existed before.
[3218.78 --> 3221.36]  So, we have to find new ways to address it.
[3221.36 --> 3229.80]  I mean, it used to be that, you know, an old newspaper clipping or, like, going and looking at microfiches in the library.
[3229.80 --> 3235.64]  That was how you, like, found old news that otherwise basically didn't exist.
[3235.86 --> 3235.96]  Yeah.
[3236.02 --> 3239.20]  But the internet's been around long enough now that...
[3239.20 --> 3241.12]  You can find a pretty detailed history on a lot of people.
[3241.34 --> 3242.20]  There's a paper trail.
[3242.40 --> 3242.60]  Yeah.
[3242.72 --> 3245.06]  That exists digitally that will never go away.
[3245.10 --> 3247.36]  Especially if people are bad with their Facebook privacy.
[3247.36 --> 3249.72]  Hey, even websites that are gone.
[3250.02 --> 3251.96]  You know, you can run around on Wayback Machine.
[3252.02 --> 3253.38]  Wayback Machine, Internet Archives.
[3254.24 --> 3254.36]  Yeah.
[3254.50 --> 3260.28]  I mean, I found some poem I wrote because someone quoted it in a reply to someone else on a forum somewhere.
[3261.22 --> 3264.28]  It was a poem about the EVGA 680i motherboard.
[3264.56 --> 3265.56]  Oh, I think I've actually read that.
[3265.58 --> 3266.16]  It was applicable.
[3266.96 --> 3269.38]  But, like, nothing's ever gone.
[3271.76 --> 3272.12]  So...
[3272.12 --> 3273.00]  I don't know, man.
[3273.12 --> 3273.78]  It's interesting.
[3273.78 --> 3278.68]  Those are, I think, way deeper topics than, like, the WAN show should necessarily be.
[3278.68 --> 3279.24]  Yeah, I know.
[3279.34 --> 3281.46]  Why don't we just do something lighthearted here?
[3281.90 --> 3283.74]  So, uh, this is fun.
[3284.56 --> 3285.88]  Uh, do what?
[3286.54 --> 3287.70]  However that's pronounced.
[3288.62 --> 3290.72]  Um, PC Master Race problems, man.
[3291.08 --> 3292.90]  Tried running Half-Life 2 at 8K.
[3293.18 --> 3295.40]  Some games just are not designed for that.
[3296.92 --> 3299.12]  The text is so small on the menu.
[3299.58 --> 3300.74]  Cannot read the menu.
[3300.74 --> 3303.86]  I was talking to people in TeamSpeak about this and they're all like,
[3303.92 --> 3306.08]  Oh my god, I can't believe he's so serious about this.
[3306.18 --> 3306.40]  Blah, blah, blah.
[3306.46 --> 3307.62]  I'm pretty sure he's sarcastic.
[3308.10 --> 3311.28]  I'm pretty sure that we're just having some fun with this topic.
[3311.48 --> 3312.68]  It looks pretty cool, though, eh?
[3313.48 --> 3314.84]  Like, not including the text.
[3314.90 --> 3317.26]  Did you look at the second one where it's just, like, the landscape?
[3317.84 --> 3321.42]  Other than the sign and the crappy grass, like, it actually looks pretty good.
[3321.78 --> 3323.50]  Increasing the resolution of the game does a lot.
[3323.62 --> 3325.28]  Resolution is more than just a number.
[3325.28 --> 3327.90]  I think we can all agree on that.
[3328.08 --> 3328.90]  Oh, Ubi.
[3329.44 --> 3332.70]  I'm slamming you so hard in a video that's coming soon.
[3333.28 --> 3334.24]  Oh, I know.
[3334.70 --> 3335.24]  I know.
[3335.30 --> 3336.06]  You were brutal.
[3336.24 --> 3337.18]  I was listening to the recording.
[3337.70 --> 3338.78]  I was pretty aggressive.
[3339.42 --> 3344.26]  Alright, so on to more light-hearted, uh, light-hearted PC Master Race news.
[3344.70 --> 3346.30]  Uh, Naughty Dog Developer says,
[3346.44 --> 3351.32]  Last of Us 1080p at 60fps is a, quote, transformative experience.
[3351.32 --> 3357.24]  This was posted on the forum by TigerBomb8, and it is pretty hilarious.
[3357.70 --> 3359.26]  Just slamming everyone.
[3359.62 --> 3360.64]  This was great.
[3360.86 --> 3362.32]  Original articles on Kit Guru.
[3362.52 --> 3363.40]  Want to give us the summary?
[3363.98 --> 3365.32]  You pretty much already did it.
[3365.36 --> 3367.32]  There's honestly not a ton more to say.
[3367.56 --> 3371.18]  Uh, Last of Us Remastered co-director Bruce Stanley also jumped in by saying,
[3371.28 --> 3373.26]  I had a dream in 60fps last night.
[3373.44 --> 3375.24]  Hashtag TLOU remastered.
[3375.62 --> 3378.94]  And a guy, uh, Neil Druckmann then replied saying,
[3378.94 --> 3380.56]  What if I told you that was no dream?
[3380.56 --> 3381.78]  Um, hashtag believe.
[3381.94 --> 3384.20]  Which I think hashtag believe was already a thing for Halo, but,
[3385.00 --> 3385.98]  either way.
[3386.24 --> 3388.32]  Um, that's, that's cool, and that's coming.
[3388.42 --> 3392.56]  And I think that's a really interesting contrast to one that I think is in Rapid Fire,
[3392.92 --> 3394.86]  which is where, what is it, Drive Club?
[3395.32 --> 3396.54]  Drive Club is 30fps.
[3397.40 --> 3400.36]  And they're like, yeah, it's cool, man.
[3400.44 --> 3401.66]  Other games are doing it too, right?
[3402.48 --> 3403.64]  Don't slam us too hard.
[3404.46 --> 3405.90]  They're like, directly, where is it?
[3405.90 --> 3406.88]  I'm gonna try and find the quote.
[3406.88 --> 3407.14]  Okay.
[3407.14 --> 3408.14]  Um...
[3408.14 --> 3412.14]  So this was posted by Rohit Kamar...
[3412.70 --> 3413.52]  Seriously?
[3415.02 --> 3418.88]  I should just start changing people on the forum's names when I can't pronounce them.
[3419.28 --> 3419.46]  Huh!
[3420.46 --> 3422.04]  So this is from Kotaku.
[3422.20 --> 3426.62]  Drive Club is 30fps for the same reason other games are, says director.
[3426.62 --> 3432.34]  So, quote unquote, I suspect a lot of people think we may have compromised the gameplay experience
[3432.34 --> 3433.54]  by choosing 30fps.
[3433.94 --> 3434.62]  Yeah, you think?
[3435.10 --> 3440.06]  Um, but we've spent a huge amount of time minimizing the latency between the pad and
[3440.06 --> 3442.30]  what happens inside the game so you never feel disconnected.
[3442.88 --> 3443.76]  Uh, no.
[3444.42 --> 3446.84]  Well, they may have a point.
[3446.84 --> 3448.96]  I mean, play Arma 2.
[3449.62 --> 3451.92]  And let's talk about laggy engines.
[3452.12 --> 3459.10]  Like, I would rather play at 30fps on Source Engine than at 60fps on Arma 2.
[3459.66 --> 3459.94]  Yeah.
[3460.38 --> 3460.84]  Like, 100%.
[3461.54 --> 3463.20]  But they don't have that many comparisons.
[3463.50 --> 3465.48]  You can't compare every single game to Arma 2.
[3465.80 --> 3466.60]  Yes, I can.
[3467.32 --> 3468.42]  But don't.
[3468.72 --> 3470.04]  Because that game is dumb.
[3470.42 --> 3471.70]  Sorry, but it is.
[3472.10 --> 3472.38]  Whoa!
[3472.38 --> 3473.44]  Because it is super broken.
[3474.54 --> 3476.14]  Like, super broken.
[3476.14 --> 3478.14]  I honestly, I wanted to play it.
[3478.22 --> 3481.96]  Because I was like, oh yeah, it like pushes graphics on the PC.
[3482.24 --> 3483.32]  I'm going to play this game.
[3483.48 --> 3485.06]  And I was like doing the training thing.
[3485.24 --> 3485.86]  And I was just like.
[3486.10 --> 3486.98]  Did you make it past training?
[3487.16 --> 3487.38]  No.
[3487.48 --> 3488.10]  No, I didn't either.
[3490.40 --> 3491.78]  I don't remember where I quit.
[3492.18 --> 3494.06]  But I got to like some point.
[3494.18 --> 3495.32]  Then I got super frustrated.
[3495.58 --> 3498.98]  And then I like was like, oh, I wonder if I can shoot the guy beside me.
[3499.00 --> 3500.84]  And I shot him and it worked and I got put in jail.
[3500.84 --> 3502.32]  And I was like, screw this game.
[3504.14 --> 3505.82]  I couldn't figure out how to get out of jail.
[3505.82 --> 3506.32]  I'm sorry.
[3506.32 --> 3507.16]  I was like, this is so dumb.
[3507.18 --> 3509.50]  Your game is just way too broken.
[3510.12 --> 3512.44]  It's like, realism simulator.
[3512.60 --> 3513.90]  You're now in jail for 10 years.
[3514.02 --> 3515.42]  Well, I don't want to play your game.
[3517.34 --> 3517.92]  Whatever, man.
[3517.92 --> 3519.16]  It's like realism simulator.
[3519.42 --> 3521.02]  I'm going to ask for a refund.
[3521.12 --> 3522.50]  Let's see how real that is.
[3522.98 --> 3524.50]  And then I'm not going to get it.
[3524.94 --> 3525.30]  Nope.
[3525.56 --> 3526.92]  Reality of buying games.
[3526.92 --> 3527.48]  Yeah.
[3528.20 --> 3528.60]  Yeah.
[3530.04 --> 3531.02]  Yeah, that sucked.
[3531.94 --> 3533.48]  I was actually super excited.
[3533.80 --> 3534.94]  And then I got put in jail.
[3535.16 --> 3536.30]  And then I never played it again.
[3536.38 --> 3538.50]  Here's kind of an amusing article from the Inquirer.
[3538.62 --> 3543.16]  Apparently, Windows 2000 gained more market share in June than Windows 8.
[3543.24 --> 3546.78]  Now, the Inquirer is known for hating on Microsoft.
[3547.06 --> 3549.42]  And they're known for sensationalist headlines.
[3549.42 --> 3552.76]  And they're also known for a lot of things.
[3552.92 --> 3555.86]  And sort of the most accurate news reporting isn't one of them.
[3556.06 --> 3556.12]  No.
[3556.18 --> 3558.40]  But this was just a pretty amusing article.
[3558.40 --> 3561.24]  Basically looking at operating system market share.
[3561.40 --> 3564.16]  Where Windows XP continues to hold a quarter of the market.
[3564.32 --> 3567.10]  With Windows 7 holding about half of the market overall.
[3567.50 --> 3570.34]  And then everything else splitting that remaining 25%.
[3570.34 --> 3574.86]  With Windows Vista coming in at something like a rocking couple percent.
[3574.86 --> 3578.86]  And Windows 8 holding only...
[3580.00 --> 3580.40]  What is it?
[3580.40 --> 3581.24]  This is very odd.
[3581.94 --> 3583.46]  Their article was written very oddly.
[3583.64 --> 3585.82]  6.61%.
[3585.82 --> 3589.78]  Which is kind of terrible, actually.
[3589.80 --> 3590.98]  It's not a lot.
[3592.02 --> 3592.60]  I mean...
[3592.60 --> 3593.78]  Hoping for that Windows 9.
[3593.98 --> 3596.32]  That's why I was so excited about the Windows 9 announcement thing.
[3596.76 --> 3597.86]  Because I was like...
[3597.86 --> 3602.88]  When Windows 8 was announced, I was like, I'm probably never going to use this.
[3603.50 --> 3604.30]  And that's okay.
[3604.30 --> 3605.28]  I use it.
[3605.46 --> 3609.02]  But I intentionally avoid as much of the horrible stuff.
[3609.02 --> 3611.78]  And you use it because it's like pre-installed on the stuff that you use it on.
[3612.38 --> 3613.54]  You use it because you're lazy.
[3613.80 --> 3614.62]  And that's fine.
[3615.60 --> 3616.52]  But like...
[3616.52 --> 3619.28]  I've never seen you go out of your way to install it.
[3623.00 --> 3624.00]  Not once ever.
[3624.34 --> 3624.86]  Nope.
[3625.36 --> 3626.12]  Not once.
[3626.20 --> 3627.62]  We're both running it right now.
[3628.02 --> 3629.16]  On our laptops.
[3629.38 --> 3629.88]  Check it out.
[3630.08 --> 3630.68]  Modern UI.
[3630.68 --> 3631.10]  Because you know what?
[3632.08 --> 3632.52]  Yeah.
[3633.16 --> 3633.44]  Woo!
[3633.44 --> 3634.56]  Yeah!
[3634.92 --> 3636.22]  That thing that he never uses.
[3636.30 --> 3636.60]  Yeah!
[3637.28 --> 3640.52]  Because you click the thing that says desktop and you never go back.
[3640.60 --> 3646.12]  I know two hotkeys on the computer that are helpful for managing Windows 8.
[3646.48 --> 3650.82]  The Windows key for opening Modern UI and Alt-Tab for getting back out of it.
[3650.82 --> 3651.82]  Yeah!
[3653.98 --> 3657.36]  Because oops you pressed that button and then wait I gotta get back to my stuff.
[3657.76 --> 3659.40]  My actually useful...
[3659.40 --> 3659.88]  The thing that only...
[3659.88 --> 3661.20]  I mean it's not that bad.
[3661.40 --> 3665.90]  The only thing that really drives me crazy about it that just makes me want to put my fist through the screen
[3665.90 --> 3669.74]  is on a new install trying to open an MP3.
[3670.46 --> 3671.82]  Or like a video file.
[3671.82 --> 3672.82]  The thing that I do...
[3672.82 --> 3672.98]  The thing that I do...
[3672.98 --> 3675.18]  And then permissions things I find to be a big issue.
[3675.38 --> 3675.64]  Ah!
[3675.94 --> 3679.36]  At least it's actually easier to disable than it was on Vista and 7.
[3679.74 --> 3681.14]  It just has a prompt that's like,
[3681.22 --> 3681.48]  Boop!
[3681.52 --> 3682.42]  Do you want to get rid of UAC?
[3683.08 --> 3683.40]  Do you...
[3683.40 --> 3683.52]  Yes.
[3683.52 --> 3684.52]  No, not even just UAC.
[3684.88 --> 3685.18]  Oh!
[3685.18 --> 3688.88]  Like trying to do any deep-rooted stuff is like really annoying.
[3689.00 --> 3689.48]  Oh, okay.
[3689.54 --> 3689.80]  Fair enough.
[3689.86 --> 3691.12]  Like really, really annoying.
[3691.78 --> 3692.22]  I don't know.
[3692.34 --> 3693.94]  I've just found...
[3693.94 --> 3696.68]  Everything that I try to do on Windows 8 or 8.1,
[3696.96 --> 3699.18]  I just find it's extremely taxing.
[3699.82 --> 3700.10]  Okay.
[3700.24 --> 3700.82]  When it really didn't need to.
[3700.82 --> 3701.14]  Yeah.
[3701.40 --> 3703.14]  Actually, there's another example.
[3703.30 --> 3704.68]  Except for stuff like file transfers,
[3704.84 --> 3707.20]  which are absolutely freaking fantastic
[3707.20 --> 3709.98]  and have almost brought me to Windows 8 multiple times.
[3710.20 --> 3710.58]  Yeah.
[3710.76 --> 3711.66]  That's really good.
[3712.00 --> 3714.58]  I mean, there are a few things that drive me kind of crazy.
[3714.58 --> 3715.10]  That's fantastic.
[3715.76 --> 3716.84]  Like user...
[3716.84 --> 3718.04]  Okay, so user accounts.
[3718.40 --> 3718.66]  Okay?
[3718.78 --> 3719.50]  If I'm like,
[3719.82 --> 3721.84]  yeah, I got my user accounts here.
[3722.08 --> 3723.38]  I want to like...
[3723.38 --> 3725.84]  I want to change something about it.
[3725.94 --> 3727.28]  I can change my account type.
[3727.28 --> 3729.98]  I can manage another account
[3729.98 --> 3731.76]  and I can change UAC settings.
[3731.98 --> 3732.96]  Other than that,
[3733.24 --> 3733.78]  if I'm like...
[3733.78 --> 3734.08]  Oh, no.
[3734.16 --> 3734.32]  Sorry.
[3734.38 --> 3734.70]  Wrong thing.
[3734.94 --> 3735.50]  If I'm like,
[3735.60 --> 3736.66]  yeah, I want to make change...
[3736.66 --> 3739.10]  Oh, really?
[3741.64 --> 3742.08]  What?
[3742.08 --> 3742.44]  Ah.
[3743.00 --> 3744.64]  And then the flip side of that
[3744.64 --> 3745.90]  is when you're in modern UI
[3745.90 --> 3747.64]  and you try to do certain things,
[3747.94 --> 3749.94]  it just drops you out of it for that.
[3750.26 --> 3751.02]  And I'm just like,
[3751.12 --> 3752.38]  oh, really?
[3752.90 --> 3754.48]  It just can't decide what it is.
[3754.54 --> 3755.00]  It's broken
[3755.00 --> 3757.34]  and maybe Windows 9 will be better,
[3757.44 --> 3759.00]  but honestly...
[3759.00 --> 3762.48]  It runs games a little bit faster,
[3762.64 --> 3764.30]  but my computer's kind of beast
[3764.30 --> 3766.60]  and most games are crappy console ports anyways.
[3766.60 --> 3767.34]  People are saying
[3767.34 --> 3768.44]  after you learn all the hotkeys,
[3768.54 --> 3769.16]  it's very usable.
[3769.60 --> 3769.76]  Nope.
[3771.48 --> 3771.92]  Okay.
[3772.16 --> 3773.68]  After you learn all the hotkeys,
[3773.80 --> 3775.20]  Adobe Premiere is very usable.
[3775.88 --> 3777.28]  That doesn't make it intuitive
[3777.28 --> 3778.76]  and that doesn't make it
[3778.76 --> 3780.92]  a well-designed UI.
[3781.42 --> 3783.30]  It just makes it usable
[3783.30 --> 3784.08]  when you're an expert.
[3784.20 --> 3785.30]  I mean, you could say that about anything.
[3785.84 --> 3787.40]  You know, mixing cocktails is easy.
[3787.74 --> 3789.14]  Once you learn what all the buttons are
[3789.14 --> 3789.72]  in a spaceship,
[3789.88 --> 3791.04]  it becomes pretty awesome.
[3791.38 --> 3792.74]  Memorize every combination
[3792.74 --> 3794.18]  and, you know,
[3794.54 --> 3796.02]  get really good at doing it
[3796.02 --> 3796.70]  and then it's easy.
[3796.84 --> 3797.78]  It's like, yeah, okay.
[3797.92 --> 3798.98]  Hooray, DOS and Linux.
[3799.88 --> 3801.88]  Yeah, DOS is easy if you...
[3801.88 --> 3803.96]  It's super easy.
[3804.10 --> 3805.48]  You can probably do things faster in DOS
[3805.48 --> 3806.16]  than you can in Windows
[3806.16 --> 3807.06]  if you know everything.
[3807.26 --> 3808.08]  Yeah, there are certain things
[3808.08 --> 3808.88]  that I can do faster
[3808.88 --> 3809.58]  in a command prompt.
[3809.78 --> 3809.94]  Yep.
[3810.20 --> 3810.36]  Yep.
[3811.26 --> 3812.48]  So speaking of which,
[3812.68 --> 3814.54]  Goodbytes has a post here
[3814.54 --> 3816.32]  about Windows 9 preview
[3816.32 --> 3817.86]  expected for the end of the year.
[3818.26 --> 3819.90]  So thank you for posting that
[3819.90 --> 3821.28]  and I don't know.
[3821.70 --> 3822.40]  Anything to say?
[3822.74 --> 3823.74]  Not a ton more
[3823.74 --> 3824.72]  than what we've already said.
[3824.88 --> 3826.48]  They've said many times
[3826.48 --> 3827.14]  that they're going to be
[3827.14 --> 3828.20]  trying to cater more
[3828.20 --> 3830.96]  to the Windows threshold
[3830.96 --> 3832.08]  desktop experience
[3832.08 --> 3833.32]  kind of thingy-majig going on
[3833.32 --> 3834.28]  which is fantastic.
[3834.42 --> 3834.90]  That's awesome.
[3834.98 --> 3835.42]  Good to hear.
[3835.60 --> 3837.18]  Who knows if they'll actually do it.
[3837.30 --> 3837.92]  Hello, Microsoft.
[3838.10 --> 3839.14]  We're going to support PC gaming.
[3840.90 --> 3842.16]  So who knows?
[3842.32 --> 3843.46]  They've also talked more
[3843.46 --> 3844.90]  about stuff like this
[3844.90 --> 3845.68]  and the yoga
[3845.68 --> 3848.04]  where it should support
[3848.04 --> 3849.04]  better transfer
[3849.04 --> 3850.38]  between when you flip your screen
[3850.38 --> 3851.28]  and it'll automatically switch
[3851.28 --> 3852.10]  to something like Metro.
[3852.10 --> 3852.74]  Mm-hmm.
[3853.60 --> 3854.78]  Should support better
[3854.78 --> 3856.44]  of doing madness.
[3857.10 --> 3858.28]  Whatever that even means.
[3858.70 --> 3859.36]  I don't know.
[3859.74 --> 3860.44]  A lot of it seems like
[3860.44 --> 3861.32]  they're talking out of their butt.
[3861.40 --> 3862.00]  They heard a lot of people
[3862.00 --> 3863.04]  complaining that they ditched
[3863.04 --> 3864.84]  the Windows 7 user
[3864.84 --> 3866.00]  desktop experience thing
[3866.00 --> 3866.92]  and now they're trying to be like,
[3867.02 --> 3868.38]  yeah, we're bringing it back.
[3869.18 --> 3870.16]  But it's Microsoft
[3870.16 --> 3871.06]  so who freaking knows.
[3871.52 --> 3871.96]  They better
[3871.96 --> 3873.38]  because this is the second one.
[3873.96 --> 3875.48]  They jumped once
[3875.48 --> 3876.16]  and then it was bad
[3876.16 --> 3877.08]  so they have to fix everything
[3877.08 --> 3877.68]  and jump again.
[3878.06 --> 3878.48]  And then the one,
[3878.74 --> 3879.92]  Windows 10 or whatever it's called
[3879.92 --> 3881.20]  will probably be terrible again.
[3881.34 --> 3881.76]  And I don't know.
[3881.82 --> 3882.84]  There are claims about,
[3882.92 --> 3883.30]  you know,
[3883.38 --> 3884.14]  supporting switching
[3884.14 --> 3885.92]  between the Metro UI
[3885.92 --> 3887.80]  and the Windows-style mode
[3887.80 --> 3888.62]  based on whether or not
[3888.62 --> 3889.50]  a keyboard is connected.
[3889.70 --> 3890.68]  I kind of look at that
[3890.68 --> 3891.04]  and I go,
[3891.22 --> 3891.98]  look, I don't know.
[3892.10 --> 3892.72]  On Surface,
[3892.86 --> 3894.30]  you guys couldn't even figure out
[3894.30 --> 3894.96]  whether to use
[3894.96 --> 3895.80]  the on-screen keyboard
[3895.80 --> 3896.94]  or the connected keyboard
[3896.94 --> 3899.68]  about 3% to 4% of the time,
[3899.82 --> 3901.12]  which doesn't sound like
[3901.12 --> 3901.84]  that big of a deal.
[3902.02 --> 3902.84]  But every single time
[3902.84 --> 3903.32]  that happens.
[3903.46 --> 3904.38]  But every time it happens,
[3904.48 --> 3904.96]  you're just like,
[3905.26 --> 3905.66]  really?
[3906.94 --> 3908.26]  And you couple that
[3908.26 --> 3909.52]  with the Windows 8's
[3909.52 --> 3911.04]  integrated on-screen keyboard
[3911.04 --> 3911.72]  is terrible.
[3911.98 --> 3913.40]  Like, it's not a tablet keyboard
[3913.40 --> 3913.92]  at all.
[3914.12 --> 3915.48]  It's basically unusable.
[3916.16 --> 3917.32]  And you just...
[3917.32 --> 3920.36]  All the jokes.
[3921.32 --> 3922.26]  I hope they fix it.
[3922.26 --> 3922.94]  This is kind of a ranty,
[3923.38 --> 3924.92]  discombobulated show,
[3924.98 --> 3925.36]  isn't it?
[3925.46 --> 3925.86]  It is.
[3925.96 --> 3927.14]  We're just mad about things
[3927.14 --> 3928.52]  because it's hot and annoying
[3928.52 --> 3929.80]  and there's kids screaming outside
[3929.80 --> 3931.18]  and we're old.
[3931.24 --> 3932.12]  Okay, so good news.
[3932.20 --> 3933.18]  Microsoft and Canon
[3933.18 --> 3936.06]  have agreed to just kind of
[3936.06 --> 3937.52]  use each other's patents
[3937.52 --> 3938.62]  and no big deal.
[3938.92 --> 3939.84]  I would like to see
[3939.84 --> 3940.86]  so much more
[3940.86 --> 3943.08]  of intellectual property sharing
[3943.08 --> 3944.32]  between companies
[3944.32 --> 3945.68]  where they're cooperating
[3945.68 --> 3946.60]  to make the technology
[3946.60 --> 3947.58]  better for us
[3947.58 --> 3949.02]  as opposed to just
[3949.02 --> 3950.24]  trolling each other
[3950.24 --> 3951.48]  and suing each other all day.
[3951.54 --> 3952.56]  I mean, I think that
[3952.56 --> 3954.16]  pretty bitter rivals
[3954.16 --> 3955.44]  have shown that
[3955.44 --> 3956.78]  it's possible in the past.
[3956.92 --> 3958.86]  Guys like Apple and HTC,
[3958.98 --> 3959.56]  for example,
[3960.04 --> 3961.08]  where there was a lot
[3961.08 --> 3962.00]  of butt hurt there
[3962.00 --> 3963.40]  and it was just
[3963.40 --> 3964.42]  dragging them both down
[3964.42 --> 3965.16]  and they're both just like,
[3965.46 --> 3967.30]  yo, okay, ceasefire.
[3967.74 --> 3968.50]  Like, that one was
[3968.50 --> 3970.30]  a relatively short-term deal,
[3970.40 --> 3972.34]  but let's just not do this anymore.
[3973.14 --> 3975.00]  And I'm just happy to see it.
[3975.06 --> 3975.94]  I mean, I don't know,
[3976.02 --> 3978.20]  I don't know necessarily
[3978.20 --> 3979.68]  what's going to come of this.
[3979.94 --> 3981.70]  Better camera on Surface 4,
[3981.84 --> 3983.26]  I guess we could hope for.
[3983.26 --> 3984.78]  I thought it was kind of weird.
[3985.66 --> 3987.08]  Maybe Canon will improve
[3987.08 --> 3988.22]  their camera software.
[3988.78 --> 3989.58]  Maybe Microsoft's
[3989.58 --> 3990.30]  going to make some printers?
[3992.12 --> 3993.98]  Like, I don't know.
[3994.62 --> 3995.86]  I'm not, I'm not sure.
[3996.12 --> 3997.00]  Do we really want Microsoft
[3997.00 --> 3998.12]  helping Canon with software?
[3998.26 --> 3999.04]  But the thing about,
[3999.10 --> 4000.36]  the thing about these companies
[4000.36 --> 4001.20]  is that they have
[4001.20 --> 4001.90]  a lot of patents
[4001.90 --> 4002.92]  that go far beyond
[4002.92 --> 4004.72]  printers and cameras
[4004.72 --> 4005.92]  and operating systems.
[4006.10 --> 4007.14]  So who knows
[4007.14 --> 4007.80]  what's going to go on?
[4007.84 --> 4008.82]  I mean, Canon owns
[4008.82 --> 4010.40]  display technology patents
[4010.40 --> 4011.18]  and stuff like that.
[4011.24 --> 4012.62]  So who knows?
[4012.86 --> 4014.08]  But there you go.
[4015.02 --> 4016.16]  Ah, every time I think
[4016.16 --> 4017.58]  about Canon displays,
[4017.94 --> 4019.44]  I wish SED had come out.
[4020.50 --> 4022.74]  It was better then
[4022.74 --> 4023.52]  than anything
[4023.52 --> 4025.26]  that still currently exists.
[4026.34 --> 4027.64]  And it never happened.
[4029.18 --> 4031.20]  I think it was a patent dispute too.
[4031.72 --> 4032.06]  I think so.
[4032.06 --> 4032.58]  I think it was an
[4032.58 --> 4033.72]  intellectual property thing.
[4033.86 --> 4033.98]  Yeah.
[4034.58 --> 4035.96]  Oh, so mad.
[4037.58 --> 4038.90]  Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4038.90 --> 4039.24]  Don't worry.
[4039.28 --> 4039.84]  I hadn't forgotten.
[4039.98 --> 4040.34]  Okay.
[4040.40 --> 4041.78]  So it's sponsor time.
[4042.32 --> 4042.68]  Squarespace.
[4043.48 --> 4043.68]  Woo!
[4044.70 --> 4045.88]  I know we talk about
[4045.88 --> 4046.86]  Squarespace a lot,
[4047.04 --> 4048.10]  but the cold hard truth
[4048.10 --> 4048.64]  is Squarespace
[4048.64 --> 4050.00]  is pretty awesome.
[4050.12 --> 4051.14]  And for a number of reasons,
[4051.50 --> 4053.02]  Squarespace is the,
[4053.16 --> 4054.10]  and this is kind of funny
[4054.10 --> 4054.94]  because we were talking
[4054.94 --> 4056.30]  about how Squarespace
[4056.30 --> 4058.46]  is what LinusMediaGroup.com
[4058.46 --> 4059.92]  runs on the other day.
[4060.14 --> 4061.16]  And then, um,
[4061.22 --> 4061.92]  one of the,
[4061.98 --> 4063.22]  one of the sort of
[4063.22 --> 4064.16]  resident buttheads
[4064.16 --> 4064.76]  on the forum
[4064.76 --> 4065.80]  was all like,
[4066.12 --> 4066.86]  I, I,
[4067.24 --> 4067.76]  there's something,
[4067.92 --> 4068.50]  I'm angry,
[4068.66 --> 4069.12]  blah, blah, blah.
[4069.20 --> 4069.74]  You're always talking
[4069.74 --> 4070.32]  about how great
[4070.32 --> 4071.16]  Squarespace is
[4071.16 --> 4071.76]  and the forum
[4071.76 --> 4072.54]  is slow
[4072.54 --> 4073.62]  and I got a
[4073.62 --> 4074.90]  captcha or something
[4074.90 --> 4076.26]  and I'm just like,
[4076.42 --> 4076.70]  well,
[4076.78 --> 4077.66]  the forum doesn't
[4077.66 --> 4078.40]  run on Squarespace.
[4078.78 --> 4079.06]  So,
[4079.20 --> 4080.46]  yeah.
[4083.12 --> 4083.56]  Um,
[4083.80 --> 4084.66]  yeah.
[4084.66 --> 4087.18]  so LinusMediaGroup.com
[4087.18 --> 4088.30]  runs on Squarespace
[4088.30 --> 4090.06]  because it's the fast,
[4090.14 --> 4090.78]  easy way to create
[4090.78 --> 4091.42]  a beautiful website
[4091.42 --> 4092.22]  that looks great
[4092.22 --> 4092.78]  on a phone,
[4092.90 --> 4093.86]  looks great on a tablet,
[4094.00 --> 4094.98]  looks great on a desktop
[4094.98 --> 4096.60]  and is extremely versatile.
[4096.92 --> 4097.64]  You can have something
[4097.64 --> 4098.48]  for your blog,
[4098.84 --> 4099.76]  for your portfolio,
[4100.26 --> 4101.54]  for your online store
[4101.54 --> 4102.72]  and the great thing
[4102.72 --> 4103.30]  about it is
[4103.30 --> 4104.98]  even if you are not,
[4105.34 --> 4105.82]  yeah,
[4105.88 --> 4106.52]  people know who it is.
[4106.74 --> 4108.84]  Even if you are not,
[4108.94 --> 4109.50]  uh,
[4109.58 --> 4109.92]  you know,
[4110.04 --> 4110.84]  web designer,
[4110.96 --> 4111.74]  even if you're not
[4111.74 --> 4112.86]  a graphic designer,
[4113.08 --> 4113.86]  they make things
[4113.86 --> 4114.90]  relatively easy
[4114.90 --> 4116.38]  so that normal people,
[4116.50 --> 4117.10]  as long as you got
[4117.10 --> 4117.70]  a little bit of
[4117.70 --> 4118.40]  computer savvy,
[4118.62 --> 4119.48]  can figure it out
[4119.48 --> 4120.58]  mostly on their own
[4120.58 --> 4121.52]  and even people
[4121.52 --> 4122.44]  who can't figure it out
[4122.44 --> 4122.90]  on their own
[4122.90 --> 4124.04]  can use their 24-7
[4124.04 --> 4124.68]  tech support
[4124.68 --> 4126.56]  to get some help
[4126.56 --> 4127.32]  and,
[4127.42 --> 4127.68]  uh,
[4127.72 --> 4128.00]  oh yeah,
[4128.08 --> 4128.56]  there's more.
[4128.92 --> 4129.98]  Squarespace also
[4129.98 --> 4131.10]  is giving away
[4131.10 --> 4132.00]  another website.
[4132.60 --> 4132.72]  So,
[4132.82 --> 4133.10]  I'm like,
[4134.24 --> 4134.76]  ah!
[4135.36 --> 4136.32]  Running for websites?
[4136.58 --> 4136.78]  Yeah,
[4136.88 --> 4137.38]  running for,
[4137.54 --> 4137.98]  running for,
[4138.06 --> 4138.72]  you don't actually
[4138.72 --> 4139.44]  have to run.
[4139.64 --> 4140.30]  Squarespace should have
[4140.30 --> 4141.48]  a super long marathon
[4141.48 --> 4141.90]  and everyone
[4141.90 --> 4142.34]  that finishes
[4142.34 --> 4143.46]  it gets a free website.
[4145.10 --> 4145.84]  And then,
[4146.46 --> 4146.96]  they,
[4147.68 --> 4147.98]  wait,
[4148.08 --> 4148.24]  what?
[4148.82 --> 4149.18]  I don't know.
[4149.46 --> 4149.78]  You know,
[4149.90 --> 4150.46]  it's funny
[4150.46 --> 4151.64]  because you rip on me
[4151.64 --> 4152.80]  for saying stupid stuff
[4152.80 --> 4153.18]  sometimes
[4153.18 --> 4154.68]  when sometimes
[4154.68 --> 4155.58]  you just aren't
[4155.58 --> 4156.74]  necessarily following
[4156.74 --> 4157.38]  what I'm saying
[4157.38 --> 4158.04]  as opposed to
[4158.04 --> 4159.52]  some interesting stuff
[4159.52 --> 4160.12]  for advertising.
[4160.28 --> 4160.32]  Like,
[4160.38 --> 4160.80]  they had that guy
[4160.80 --> 4161.80]  make the song
[4161.80 --> 4162.34]  and they had all
[4162.34 --> 4162.78]  this other kind
[4162.78 --> 4163.40]  of stuff going on.
[4163.58 --> 4164.40]  Squarespace marathon?
[4164.40 --> 4164.58]  If they did a
[4164.58 --> 4165.24]  Squarespace marathon,
[4165.46 --> 4166.46]  that would get press.
[4166.58 --> 4167.92]  People would talk about it
[4167.92 --> 4168.84]  because it's weird.
[4169.96 --> 4171.46]  How many website designers
[4171.46 --> 4172.60]  could run a marathon?
[4173.84 --> 4174.50]  I could.
[4174.58 --> 4174.76]  I mean,
[4174.82 --> 4175.40]  let's talk,
[4175.42 --> 4176.76]  let's talk Venn diagrams,
[4176.94 --> 4177.08]  okay?
[4177.12 --> 4178.06]  Could you run a marathon?
[4178.88 --> 4179.62]  I run 8K.
[4179.84 --> 4180.20]  What's the,
[4180.20 --> 4181.16]  what's the definition
[4181.16 --> 4181.54]  of a marathon?
[4181.54 --> 4182.54]  A lot more than 8K.
[4182.70 --> 4183.20]  Is there like
[4183.20 --> 4184.06]  an actual definition
[4184.06 --> 4184.28]  of a marathon?
[4184.28 --> 4184.60]  Yes.
[4184.80 --> 4186.36]  A marathon is a specific thing.
[4186.72 --> 4187.78]  Just like a half marathon
[4187.78 --> 4189.20]  is half of that specific thing.
[4189.22 --> 4189.72]  26 miles,
[4189.80 --> 4190.16]  I quit.
[4192.16 --> 4192.56]  Yeah.
[4193.24 --> 4194.06]  So let's talk
[4194.06 --> 4194.76]  Venn diagrams
[4194.76 --> 4195.24]  for a minute here.
[4195.24 --> 4195.80]  We've got people
[4195.80 --> 4196.90]  who can run marathons
[4196.90 --> 4198.06]  and we've got
[4198.06 --> 4200.00]  website designers.
[4201.68 --> 4202.32]  Put like
[4202.32 --> 4203.32]  a fingernail.
[4203.50 --> 4203.62]  Yeah.
[4204.12 --> 4205.32]  Maybe they touch each other.
[4205.54 --> 4205.90]  You know what?
[4205.92 --> 4207.12]  I want to hear from you guys
[4207.12 --> 4207.90]  in the Twitch chatter
[4207.90 --> 4208.42]  on Twitter.
[4208.64 --> 4210.64]  Are you a website designer
[4210.64 --> 4212.20]  who can run a marathon?
[4212.64 --> 4213.32]  And if so,
[4213.50 --> 4214.08]  kudos to you.
[4214.40 --> 4214.62]  Anyway,
[4214.72 --> 4215.68]  the point is...
[4215.68 --> 4216.28]  Yeah, 40 kilometers.
[4217.64 --> 4218.32]  Shoddy not.
[4218.50 --> 4218.78]  Yeah,
[4218.84 --> 4219.46]  and it changes.
[4219.46 --> 4221.56]  So 42 more recently.
[4221.76 --> 4221.98]  Oh no,
[4222.04 --> 4222.18]  oh.
[4222.18 --> 4222.68]  That's older.
[4222.98 --> 4223.12]  No,
[4223.16 --> 4223.46]  that's newer.
[4224.28 --> 4225.12]  1924?
[4225.50 --> 4226.86]  Is newer than 1896.
[4226.88 --> 4227.06]  Oh,
[4227.10 --> 4227.70]  I thought it was a 19.
[4230.04 --> 4231.26]  You were going after me
[4231.26 --> 4232.76]  about that privacy topic earlier
[4232.76 --> 4234.36]  so I'm taking every opportunity
[4234.36 --> 4235.26]  from now
[4235.26 --> 4236.22]  until the rest of the show.
[4237.06 --> 4238.38]  So the point is,
[4238.44 --> 4238.64]  right,
[4238.76 --> 4239.08]  Squarespace.
[4239.28 --> 4240.16]  They're giving away a website.
[4240.34 --> 4241.30]  All you have to do
[4241.30 --> 4242.26]  is tweet with
[4242.26 --> 4242.86]  hashtag
[4242.86 --> 4243.98]  LinusSquarespace
[4243.98 --> 4245.00]  sometime
[4245.00 --> 4246.64]  in the next week
[4246.64 --> 4248.14]  and we will show off
[4248.14 --> 4248.88]  your website
[4248.88 --> 4249.96]  on the show
[4249.96 --> 4250.82]  and then
[4250.82 --> 4252.02]  one of those
[4252.02 --> 4252.84]  lucky winners
[4252.84 --> 4254.08]  will get a free site
[4254.08 --> 4255.28]  for a year.
[4255.50 --> 4256.16]  For those of you
[4256.16 --> 4256.88]  who don't win,
[4257.20 --> 4257.94]  you can visit
[4257.94 --> 4258.72]  squarespace.com
[4258.72 --> 4259.30]  slash Linus
[4259.30 --> 4260.24]  for a free trial.
[4260.42 --> 4261.26]  It's a two-week trial
[4261.26 --> 4262.78]  and you can get 10% off
[4262.78 --> 4264.02]  if you use offer code Linus.
[4264.14 --> 4264.86]  The great thing
[4264.86 --> 4265.96]  about the free trial
[4265.96 --> 4266.82]  is that
[4266.82 --> 4267.78]  you can completely
[4267.78 --> 4268.56]  design your website,
[4268.76 --> 4269.84]  decide if you like the service,
[4270.00 --> 4270.96]  decide if the scalability
[4270.96 --> 4271.90]  is going to work for you
[4271.90 --> 4272.70]  and then
[4272.70 --> 4274.20]  you have no obligation
[4274.20 --> 4275.00]  to use it
[4275.00 --> 4276.10]  whatsoever.
[4277.08 --> 4278.62]  So we've actually got,
[4278.74 --> 4279.82]  I've got another one.
[4279.90 --> 4281.08]  I've got one to show you guys
[4281.08 --> 4282.38]  that's from last time
[4282.38 --> 4283.34]  we did one of these.
[4283.46 --> 4284.06]  Here we go,
[4284.18 --> 4285.00]  Linus is screen sharing.
[4285.24 --> 4286.02]  Last time we did
[4286.02 --> 4286.94]  one of these giveaways.
[4287.26 --> 4287.74]  I'm just going to
[4287.74 --> 4288.84]  put it on the top.
[4289.06 --> 4290.92]  So this is Pascal Brunner's
[4290.92 --> 4292.28]  website, evidently.
[4292.44 --> 4292.98]  I haven't actually
[4292.98 --> 4293.90]  looked at this one before.
[4294.00 --> 4294.86]  I just picked out one of them.
[4294.94 --> 4295.58]  So the idea
[4295.58 --> 4297.20]  is that it's super easy
[4297.20 --> 4297.84]  to build something
[4297.84 --> 4298.94]  that is as complicated
[4298.94 --> 4299.92]  or as simple
[4299.92 --> 4300.52]  as you'd like
[4300.52 --> 4301.82]  and it should look great,
[4301.96 --> 4302.72]  perform well,
[4303.02 --> 4303.78]  and just generally
[4303.78 --> 4304.32]  be pleasing
[4304.32 --> 4305.30]  for people to browse.
[4305.66 --> 4306.44]  Something that
[4306.44 --> 4307.86]  you really can't do
[4307.86 --> 4308.46]  with WordPress
[4308.46 --> 4309.76]  or similar services
[4309.76 --> 4310.40]  unless you're willing
[4310.40 --> 4311.58]  to put a lot more work
[4311.58 --> 4312.00]  into it.
[4312.48 --> 4313.66]  I happen to be using
[4313.66 --> 4314.16]  my touchscreen
[4314.16 --> 4315.38]  to navigate it right now.
[4315.54 --> 4316.38]  So, you know,
[4316.44 --> 4317.44]  the kinds of compatibility
[4317.44 --> 4318.48]  things that you just
[4318.48 --> 4319.20]  don't have to really
[4319.20 --> 4319.82]  think about.
[4320.56 --> 4321.26]  And, uh,
[4321.28 --> 4321.88]  look at this.
[4322.06 --> 4322.58]  So we can,
[4322.70 --> 4323.76]  we can browse
[4323.76 --> 4324.98]  his travel blog.
[4325.24 --> 4325.54]  Apparently,
[4325.72 --> 4326.44]  hasn't filled that in.
[4326.70 --> 4327.42]  Maybe, uh,
[4327.48 --> 4328.14]  maybe he's hoping
[4328.14 --> 4329.80]  to win the website
[4329.80 --> 4330.70]  before fleshing it out
[4330.70 --> 4331.16]  a little bit more.
[4331.22 --> 4331.78]  But the point is
[4331.78 --> 4332.44]  that it works
[4332.44 --> 4333.28]  and it really doesn't
[4333.28 --> 4334.44]  take that much work
[4334.44 --> 4335.06]  for it to work.
[4335.06 --> 4335.98]  Which leads us
[4335.98 --> 4337.28]  to our second sponsor
[4337.28 --> 4338.16]  of the show today,
[4338.94 --> 4339.74]  FaZe, apparently.
[4340.38 --> 4340.82]  FaZe, yeah.
[4341.76 --> 4342.14]  I don't,
[4342.88 --> 4343.50]  I don't know.
[4344.64 --> 4345.64]  Is that his symbol?
[4346.32 --> 4346.80]  I haven't seen that.
[4346.80 --> 4347.64]  It's actually not that different.
[4347.64 --> 4348.34]  He's gonna get naked.
[4348.46 --> 4349.46]  Yeah, I'm getting naked
[4349.46 --> 4351.32]  because I believe
[4351.32 --> 4352.04]  in wearing my
[4352.04 --> 4352.94]  WAN Show shirt
[4352.94 --> 4353.90]  for the WAN Show
[4353.90 --> 4355.24]  as much as I can.
[4356.92 --> 4358.18]  It's really similar.
[4358.64 --> 4359.60]  It's not the same.
[4359.98 --> 4360.88]  Yeah, it's not the same.
[4361.52 --> 4362.22]  Alright, so
[4362.22 --> 4363.34]  5-4 Club,
[4363.70 --> 4365.50]  are you a big fan
[4365.50 --> 4366.70]  of shopping in the mall?
[4367.44 --> 4368.78]  Are you a big fan
[4368.78 --> 4371.58]  of clothing salespeople?
[4372.36 --> 4373.72]  Are you a big fan
[4373.72 --> 4374.32]  of,
[4374.40 --> 4375.54]  what else is horrible
[4375.54 --> 4376.72]  about shopping for clothes?
[4377.00 --> 4378.00]  Those were like
[4378.00 --> 4380.12]  pretty widely encompassing.
[4380.22 --> 4381.20]  Are you a fan
[4381.20 --> 4382.22]  of, you know,
[4382.60 --> 4383.10]  keeping up
[4383.10 --> 4384.24]  with the latest fashions?
[4384.32 --> 4385.24]  Is the best thing
[4385.24 --> 4385.94]  in the store
[4385.94 --> 4386.88]  the boyfriend chair?
[4387.08 --> 4388.24]  Yeah, I know, right?
[4388.80 --> 4389.98]  Because yes it is.
[4390.14 --> 4391.24]  Because yes it is.
[4391.24 --> 4392.90]  So 5-4 Club
[4392.90 --> 4394.34]  is basically
[4394.34 --> 4394.92]  the way
[4394.92 --> 4395.78]  to not have to worry
[4395.78 --> 4396.92]  about your wardrobe anymore.
[4397.34 --> 4398.44]  The basic premise
[4398.44 --> 4399.06]  behind it
[4399.06 --> 4400.02]  is they send you
[4400.02 --> 4400.90]  at least
[4400.90 --> 4403.24]  $150 worth of clothing
[4403.24 --> 4404.28]  every month
[4404.28 --> 4405.50]  and then what you pay
[4405.50 --> 4407.64]  is $50 a month.
[4407.72 --> 4408.54]  And what's cool
[4408.54 --> 4409.16]  about that
[4409.16 --> 4410.38]  is that you
[4410.38 --> 4411.50]  don't have to think
[4411.50 --> 4412.06]  about anything.
[4412.18 --> 4412.80]  They assign you
[4412.80 --> 4414.10]  a personalized stylist
[4414.10 --> 4415.38]  who picks stuff
[4415.38 --> 4416.02]  out for you
[4416.02 --> 4416.84]  so you don't do
[4416.84 --> 4417.52]  any thinking.
[4417.84 --> 4418.78]  New clothing arrives
[4418.78 --> 4419.34]  once a month.
[4419.44 --> 4419.88]  You just do
[4419.88 --> 4420.56]  a quick questionnaire.
[4420.78 --> 4421.48]  It takes less
[4421.48 --> 4422.56]  than a minute
[4422.56 --> 4423.94]  which is pretty
[4423.94 --> 4424.62]  darn cool
[4424.62 --> 4425.90]  and then you
[4425.90 --> 4426.52]  basically say
[4426.52 --> 4426.92]  okay look
[4426.92 --> 4427.84]  I like these shoes
[4427.84 --> 4428.80]  I like these shirts
[4428.80 --> 4429.84]  I like these pants
[4429.84 --> 4431.52]  and they just
[4431.52 --> 4432.76]  completely deal
[4432.76 --> 4433.98]  with the whole thing
[4433.98 --> 4435.08]  for you.
[4435.92 --> 4436.66]  Luke, do you want
[4436.66 --> 4437.12]  to show off
[4437.12 --> 4438.44]  your 5-4 Club shirt?
[4438.52 --> 4439.26]  It's a little tight.
[4439.70 --> 4440.40]  I think everyone
[4440.40 --> 4441.90]  can see it.
[4442.36 --> 4443.06]  I liked the
[4443.06 --> 4444.68]  more conservative
[4444.68 --> 4445.50]  oh no we both
[4445.50 --> 4446.18]  have pretty conservative
[4446.18 --> 4446.82]  design shirts.
[4446.82 --> 4447.88]  Nick has one
[4447.88 --> 4448.24]  that's like
[4448.24 --> 4449.72]  5-4 clothing
[4449.72 --> 4451.02]  and I actually
[4451.02 --> 4451.96]  like the small logo
[4451.96 --> 4452.62]  that apparently
[4452.62 --> 4453.10]  looks like
[4453.10 --> 4453.82]  FaZe's logo
[4453.82 --> 4455.60]  but yeah
[4455.60 --> 4455.94]  I think it's
[4455.94 --> 4456.38]  pretty cool.
[4456.72 --> 4457.46]  It's speckled.
[4458.14 --> 4458.38]  I don't know
[4458.38 --> 4458.68]  if the camera
[4458.68 --> 4459.10]  can see that
[4459.10 --> 4459.50]  very well.
[4460.38 --> 4461.00]  Not really.
[4461.66 --> 4461.98]  But yeah
[4461.98 --> 4462.44]  there you go.
[4462.88 --> 4463.56]  I like V-necks
[4463.56 --> 4464.20]  and it's a V-neck
[4464.20 --> 4465.02]  so that's pretty cool.
[4466.06 --> 4466.54]  Yeah they've got
[4466.54 --> 4466.94]  a whole bunch
[4466.94 --> 4467.54]  of different stuff.
[4467.68 --> 4468.40]  You're not really
[4468.40 --> 4470.26]  stuck with one thing
[4470.26 --> 4471.00]  versus another one.
[4471.00 --> 4472.46]  what do you like
[4472.46 --> 4473.42]  kind of questionnaire
[4473.42 --> 4474.26]  when you sign up
[4474.26 --> 4474.48]  right?
[4474.78 --> 4475.36]  Yeah and I thought
[4475.36 --> 4476.54]  they weren't necessarily
[4476.54 --> 4477.58]  I thought they were
[4477.58 --> 4478.36]  kind of pulling my leg
[4478.36 --> 4478.74]  when they said
[4478.74 --> 4479.54]  it takes less than a minute
[4479.54 --> 4480.44]  but it actually took me
[4480.44 --> 4481.74]  like 54 seconds
[4481.74 --> 4483.06]  or whatever
[4483.06 --> 4484.18]  something along those lines.
[4484.50 --> 4485.18]  I love those surveys
[4485.18 --> 4485.58]  that are like
[4485.58 --> 4486.38]  this will take like
[4486.38 --> 4487.08]  three minutes
[4487.08 --> 4487.98]  half an hour later
[4487.98 --> 4488.30]  and you're like
[4488.30 --> 4489.12]  oh god
[4489.12 --> 4490.78]  why is there so much crap?
[4491.60 --> 4491.96]  But yeah
[4491.96 --> 4492.78]  they put you through
[4492.78 --> 4493.40]  this little questionnaire
[4493.40 --> 4494.00]  survey thing
[4494.00 --> 4494.70]  so you don't get stuff
[4494.70 --> 4495.48]  you're totally not
[4495.48 --> 4495.92]  going to want.
[4496.26 --> 4496.76]  They can actually
[4496.76 --> 4497.76]  profile you a little bit
[4497.76 --> 4498.54]  and then send you things
[4498.54 --> 4499.24]  that you will hopefully
[4499.24 --> 4499.82]  actually like
[4499.82 --> 4500.68]  which is pretty cool.
[4501.00 --> 4502.36]  What are you looking for?
[4502.56 --> 4504.06]  I'm looking for the numbers
[4504.06 --> 4504.60]  because I think
[4504.60 --> 4505.82]  I might have gotten them wrong
[4505.82 --> 4507.54]  which is going to be terrible.
[4508.02 --> 4508.36]  Okay
[4508.36 --> 4510.00]  for $60 a month
[4510.00 --> 4512.24]  you get $120 worth of clothing.
[4512.46 --> 4512.82]  There we go.
[4512.86 --> 4513.12]  Wow
[4513.12 --> 4513.90]  that's terrible.
[4514.32 --> 4515.16]  So basically
[4515.16 --> 4516.24]  the thing that's going on
[4516.24 --> 4516.80]  right now though
[4516.80 --> 4518.08]  is for the 4th of July
[4518.08 --> 4519.80]  you can use offer code
[4519.80 --> 4520.70]  Linus4th
[4520.70 --> 4522.48]  for $20 off your first package.
[4522.58 --> 4523.14]  So you're getting
[4523.14 --> 4525.30]  an MSRP of $120 worth of clothing
[4525.30 --> 4525.72]  for $40.
[4526.08 --> 4527.68]  You can cancel at any time.
[4528.06 --> 4529.80]  It's actually super simple to do.
[4529.80 --> 4531.16]  We had one person on the forum
[4531.16 --> 4532.04]  that basically went
[4532.04 --> 4533.04]  yeah you know what
[4533.04 --> 4533.86]  the quality of the clothing
[4533.86 --> 4534.30]  is nice
[4534.30 --> 4536.16]  but it doesn't quite work for me.
[4536.26 --> 4537.26]  I don't want to continue it
[4537.26 --> 4539.30]  and boom
[4539.30 --> 4539.96]  it was done
[4539.96 --> 4540.60]  just like that.
[4540.66 --> 4541.26]  So it was pretty easy
[4541.26 --> 4542.24]  to get taken care of
[4542.24 --> 4543.92]  and I think that is pretty much it.
[4544.00 --> 4545.04]  Do we know where they ship to?
[4545.50 --> 4546.48]  Do we know where they ship to?
[4546.58 --> 4546.80]  Yeah.
[4546.80 --> 4548.60]  People are asking that.
[4548.62 --> 4549.86]  US and Canada for sure.
[4550.08 --> 4550.34]  Yes.
[4550.42 --> 4552.46]  Not 100% sure outside of that.
[4552.56 --> 4553.32]  So you're going to want to go to
[4553.32 --> 4555.24]  bit.ly slash Linus FFC
[4555.24 --> 4557.92]  and use offer code Linus4th
[4557.92 --> 4559.00]  4TH
[4559.00 --> 4561.96]  in order to redeem your extra amount off.
[4562.14 --> 4563.54]  Normally for 5-4 Club
[4563.54 --> 4566.16]  you guys can get $15 off your first purchase
[4566.16 --> 4568.12]  so now it's just an extra $5
[4568.12 --> 4569.66]  just so they can give you guys
[4569.66 --> 4570.34]  a little incentive
[4570.34 --> 4571.92]  to try it out here
[4571.92 --> 4573.66]  because if you hate clothing shopping
[4573.66 --> 4575.22]  anywhere near as much as I do
[4575.22 --> 4576.66]  then yeah
[4576.66 --> 4577.50]  there's that.
[4577.64 --> 4579.90]  I feel terrible about getting those numbers wrong.
[4580.28 --> 4582.80]  I'm not necessarily that great with numbers
[4582.80 --> 4585.02]  and then they went and they changed them around on me today
[4585.02 --> 4586.04]  and I was like
[4586.04 --> 4586.68]  okay
[4586.68 --> 4588.40]  the 20 corresponds to
[4588.40 --> 4589.58]  the discount
[4589.58 --> 4592.02]  but then the amount that it normally is
[4592.02 --> 4593.10]  corresponds to whatever
[4593.10 --> 4594.08]  whatever the heck it is.
[4594.64 --> 4596.06]  The cool thing about it is that
[4596.06 --> 4596.72]  aside from
[4596.72 --> 4597.66]  I mean if you're into
[4597.66 --> 4599.38]  you know which celebrities wear it
[4599.38 --> 4601.76]  the list is actually kind of ridiculous.
[4601.92 --> 4603.34]  like if you go on their site
[4603.34 --> 4604.54]  I get that though
[4604.54 --> 4606.34]  I would probably want a mail order thing
[4606.34 --> 4607.60]  if I was a celebrity person.
[4608.42 --> 4609.68]  I guess that makes sense.
[4609.86 --> 4610.04]  Yeah.
[4611.00 --> 4611.70]  I don't know.
[4612.00 --> 4612.64]  I was just like
[4612.64 --> 4613.86]  Mark Wahlberg
[4613.86 --> 4615.66]  is the sexiest hunk of man
[4615.66 --> 4616.58]  on the face of the earth
[4616.58 --> 4617.64]  and I was like
[4617.64 --> 4619.40]  he wears 5'4
[4619.40 --> 4619.96]  so I was like
[4619.96 --> 4620.80]  that's pretty cool.
[4620.94 --> 4621.62]  Isn't he like
[4621.62 --> 4623.60]  wasn't he convicted or something?
[4624.10 --> 4624.68]  Mark Wahlberg?
[4624.82 --> 4625.16]  Really?
[4625.80 --> 4626.12]  Shut up.
[4626.12 --> 4627.54]  I might be thinking the wrong person.
[4629.12 --> 4630.56]  I don't think so.
[4632.90 --> 4633.98]  You've got to be kidding me.
[4634.80 --> 4635.10]  Huh.
[4636.10 --> 4636.50]  Yeah.
[4636.62 --> 4637.28]  He was like
[4637.28 --> 4639.12]  yeah.
[4639.34 --> 4640.06]  I don't know.
[4640.42 --> 4641.38]  Well he could still be sexy
[4641.38 --> 4641.88]  even if
[4641.88 --> 4644.26]  even if he has a bit of a checkered past.
[4644.56 --> 4645.20]  So newsflash
[4645.20 --> 4646.24]  Linus is into bad boys.
[4647.20 --> 4647.54]  Yeah.
[4649.22 --> 4650.30]  I'm not ashamed of it.
[4651.48 --> 4652.02]  All right.
[4652.04 --> 4653.06]  So that's pretty much it.
[4653.12 --> 4653.86]  5'4 club
[4653.86 --> 4655.10]  and let's move on
[4655.10 --> 4656.00]  to our next topic shall we?
[4656.00 --> 4657.02]  All right.
[4659.30 --> 4660.54]  So next what we got.
[4660.78 --> 4662.30]  We jumped all over the place.
[4662.38 --> 4663.32]  New extreme editions
[4663.32 --> 4665.18]  are rumored to be coming very soon.
[4665.32 --> 4666.44]  I think calling this a rumor
[4666.44 --> 4667.14]  at this point
[4667.14 --> 4668.00]  is
[4668.00 --> 4669.46]  It's been rumored
[4669.46 --> 4670.18]  to be coming
[4670.18 --> 4672.28]  at like a fairly specific date
[4672.28 --> 4673.24]  for a long time.
[4673.40 --> 4674.50]  Every rumor is like
[4674.50 --> 4674.80]  yep
[4674.80 --> 4675.68]  just don't forget
[4675.68 --> 4678.58]  we thought it was
[4678.58 --> 4679.74]  this time a while ago.
[4680.00 --> 4681.16]  It's rumored
[4681.16 --> 4682.80]  to be priced at
[4682.80 --> 4683.70]  $1,000
[4683.70 --> 4684.60]  just like
[4684.60 --> 4685.10]  Whoa
[4685.10 --> 4686.02]  surprising
[4686.02 --> 4687.64]  Every other extreme edition ever
[4687.64 --> 4689.30]  but what's exciting
[4689.30 --> 4689.96]  about the rumors
[4689.96 --> 4690.94]  for Haswell E
[4690.94 --> 4691.98]  so this is Intel's
[4691.98 --> 4693.22]  upcoming enthusiast
[4693.22 --> 4694.12]  slash workstation
[4694.12 --> 4694.98]  grade processors
[4694.98 --> 4696.02]  is that
[4696.02 --> 4697.72]  the lower end chips
[4697.72 --> 4699.24]  even the lowest end one
[4699.24 --> 4700.20]  so the
[4700.20 --> 4702.44]  5820k
[4702.44 --> 4702.90]  allegedly
[4702.90 --> 4703.96]  5820k
[4703.96 --> 4705.22]  is going to
[4705.22 --> 4705.74]  allegedly
[4705.74 --> 4706.38]  rumoredly
[4706.38 --> 4707.66]  be a 6 core
[4707.66 --> 4709.14]  up until now
[4709.14 --> 4710.98]  processors like
[4710.98 --> 4712.64]  the 4820k
[4712.64 --> 4714.20]  have just not made
[4714.20 --> 4715.20]  a lot of sense to me
[4715.20 --> 4716.28]  like I guess
[4716.28 --> 4717.36]  if I only need
[4717.36 --> 4718.14]  a quad core
[4718.14 --> 4718.82]  There's a reason why
[4718.82 --> 4719.56]  that one's in the thermal
[4719.56 --> 4719.80]  thing
[4719.80 --> 4720.58]  I specifically
[4720.58 --> 4722.14]  only need a quad core
[4722.14 --> 4724.02]  but I really need
[4724.02 --> 4725.84]  64 gigs of RAM
[4725.84 --> 4726.68]  or more
[4726.68 --> 4728.84]  unbuffered memory
[4728.84 --> 4729.86]  64 gigs of unbuffered memory
[4729.86 --> 4730.58]  I'm sure someone can
[4730.58 --> 4731.42]  find a use for that
[4731.42 --> 4731.88]  like if I
[4731.88 --> 4733.32]  but I don't need
[4733.32 --> 4733.84]  a 6 core
[4733.84 --> 4734.80]  that's the one
[4734.80 --> 4735.26]  I don't understand
[4735.26 --> 4735.72]  I'm going to buy
[4735.72 --> 4736.62]  all that RAM
[4736.62 --> 4737.32]  but I don't need
[4737.32 --> 4737.88]  the 6 core
[4737.88 --> 4738.16]  and like that
[4738.16 --> 4738.80]  baller expensive
[4738.80 --> 4739.28]  motherboard
[4739.28 --> 4741.12]  and not spend
[4741.12 --> 4741.52]  the like
[4741.52 --> 4742.04]  little bit more
[4742.04 --> 4743.00]  So those quad cores
[4743.00 --> 4743.92]  on LGA 2011
[4743.92 --> 4744.66]  have always been
[4744.66 --> 4745.28]  a bit of a
[4745.28 --> 4746.44]  bit of a black sheep
[4746.44 --> 4746.84]  to me
[4746.84 --> 4747.90]  whereas now
[4747.90 --> 4748.64]  we're going to get
[4748.64 --> 4749.28]  an 8 core
[4749.28 --> 4749.90]  extreme edition
[4749.90 --> 4750.92]  this is the first time
[4750.92 --> 4752.06]  Intel has differentiated
[4752.06 --> 4752.90]  an extreme edition
[4752.90 --> 4753.62]  based on the number
[4753.62 --> 4753.98]  of cores
[4753.98 --> 4755.00]  since the 980x
[4755.00 --> 4755.82]  so we're going to get
[4755.82 --> 4756.36]  an 8 core
[4756.36 --> 4757.02]  extreme edition
[4757.02 --> 4758.00]  and then we are
[4758.00 --> 4758.84]  going to get
[4758.84 --> 4760.62]  a 6 core
[4760.62 --> 4761.50]  step down
[4761.50 --> 4762.80]  and then a 6 core
[4762.80 --> 4763.66]  hopefully
[4763.66 --> 4766.16]  like 350 to
[4766.16 --> 4767.26]  400 dollar range
[4767.26 --> 4767.76]  CPU
[4767.76 --> 4768.38]  which would be
[4768.38 --> 4769.20]  All of this is
[4769.20 --> 4770.76]  really exciting
[4770.76 --> 4771.12]  hopefully
[4771.12 --> 4771.44]  maybe
[4771.44 --> 4773.02]  possibly
[4773.02 --> 4774.86]  I would love
[4774.86 --> 4775.42]  being one of the
[4775.42 --> 4776.38]  like rumor writers
[4776.38 --> 4777.52]  for the sites
[4777.52 --> 4778.20]  that kind of
[4778.20 --> 4778.98]  spread rumors around
[4778.98 --> 4779.66]  especially for
[4779.66 --> 4780.38]  Intel stuff
[4780.38 --> 4781.78]  price for the
[4781.78 --> 4782.42]  extreme edition
[4782.42 --> 4783.88]  9.99
[4783.88 --> 4786.02]  crazy balls
[4786.02 --> 4786.34]  right
[4786.34 --> 4786.64]  yeah
[4786.64 --> 4787.22]  the other ones
[4787.22 --> 4787.56]  are a little
[4787.56 --> 4788.16]  more difficult
[4788.16 --> 4788.62]  yeah
[4788.62 --> 4789.24]  because you have
[4789.24 --> 4789.64]  to memorize
[4789.64 --> 4790.64]  different numbers
[4790.64 --> 4792.94]  but uh
[4792.94 --> 4793.98]  oh the other thing
[4793.98 --> 4794.52]  is that the
[4794.52 --> 4795.30]  platform will use
[4795.30 --> 4796.10]  DDR4
[4796.10 --> 4796.82]  so we could be
[4796.82 --> 4797.30]  looking at
[4797.30 --> 4798.02]  higher speeds
[4798.02 --> 4798.92]  lower power consumption
[4798.92 --> 4799.62]  higher density
[4799.62 --> 4800.58]  cost
[4800.58 --> 4801.32]  could be
[4801.32 --> 4801.84]  looking at
[4801.84 --> 4802.02]  yeah
[4802.02 --> 4803.04]  but the cost
[4803.04 --> 4803.70]  is expected
[4803.70 --> 4804.82]  to be extremely
[4804.82 --> 4806.34]  high for DDR4
[4806.34 --> 4806.98]  initially
[4806.98 --> 4807.74]  early adopters
[4807.74 --> 4808.14]  I'll be
[4808.14 --> 4808.52]  I'll be
[4808.52 --> 4808.96]  I mean
[4808.96 --> 4810.02]  really the
[4810.02 --> 4810.64]  extreme edition
[4810.64 --> 4811.42]  might end up
[4811.42 --> 4811.84]  being the only
[4811.84 --> 4812.44]  one that actually
[4812.44 --> 4813.20]  makes any sense
[4813.20 --> 4813.94]  yep
[4813.94 --> 4814.68]  because you're
[4814.68 --> 4815.56]  gonna get a
[4815.56 --> 4815.86]  quad
[4815.86 --> 4816.46]  you're gonna get
[4816.46 --> 4817.02]  a uh
[4817.02 --> 4817.66]  an octa core
[4817.66 --> 4818.88]  as opposed to
[4818.88 --> 4819.48]  a 6 core
[4819.48 --> 4820.80]  and you're gonna
[4820.80 --> 4821.26]  have to pay a
[4821.26 --> 4821.94]  premium for it
[4821.94 --> 4822.32]  but you're gonna
[4822.32 --> 4823.06]  get an octa core
[4823.06 --> 4823.50]  and then you're
[4823.50 --> 4823.76]  gonna have to pay
[4823.76 --> 4824.36]  a premium for that
[4824.36 --> 4824.68]  ram
[4824.68 --> 4825.34]  but you're gonna
[4825.34 --> 4826.20]  get an octa core
[4826.20 --> 4827.28]  whereas buying
[4827.28 --> 4828.46]  older LGA 2011
[4828.46 --> 4829.04]  Ivy Bridge
[4829.04 --> 4830.06]  eCPUs
[4830.06 --> 4830.86]  and DDR3
[4830.86 --> 4831.72]  is probably
[4831.72 --> 4832.08]  gonna make
[4832.08 --> 4832.60]  a lot more
[4832.60 --> 4832.86]  sense
[4832.86 --> 4833.26]  something like
[4833.26 --> 4834.42]  a 4930k
[4834.42 --> 4835.04]  where you get
[4835.04 --> 4835.58]  a 6 core
[4835.58 --> 4836.44]  and DDR3
[4836.44 --> 4836.98]  and saving money
[4836.98 --> 4837.70]  on both of those
[4837.70 --> 4838.30]  because the new
[4838.30 --> 4838.76]  ones are out
[4838.76 --> 4839.16]  because it'll
[4839.16 --> 4839.76]  be DDR4
[4839.76 --> 4840.10]  which will
[4840.10 --> 4840.94]  hopefully
[4840.94 --> 4841.72]  drive the price
[4841.72 --> 4842.56]  of DDR3 down
[4842.56 --> 4843.32]  because damn
[4843.32 --> 4843.68]  what's been
[4843.68 --> 4844.22]  happening to that
[4844.22 --> 4844.52]  lately
[4844.52 --> 4845.38]  uh
[4845.38 --> 4846.36]  your factory
[4846.36 --> 4846.86]  had problems
[4846.86 --> 4847.56]  a long time
[4847.56 --> 4847.84]  ago
[4847.84 --> 4848.34]  bros
[4848.34 --> 4849.52]  bring that
[4849.52 --> 4849.96]  price back
[4849.96 --> 4850.34]  down
[4850.34 --> 4851.58]  um
[4851.58 --> 4852.46]  originally posted
[4852.46 --> 4852.94]  on the forum
[4852.94 --> 4853.86]  by Ewan
[4853.86 --> 4854.70]  Ewan
[4854.70 --> 4855.26]  Ewan
[4855.26 --> 4856.90]  whatever
[4856.90 --> 4858.72]  I give up
[4858.72 --> 4859.80]  the division
[4859.80 --> 4860.82]  might have
[4860.82 --> 4862.28]  microtransactions
[4862.28 --> 4862.96]  remember
[4862.96 --> 4863.56]  remember that
[4863.56 --> 4864.24]  talk we had
[4864.24 --> 4865.04]  about Ubisoft
[4865.04 --> 4866.14]  and how they
[4866.14 --> 4866.76]  they didn't like
[4866.76 --> 4867.24]  DRM
[4867.24 --> 4868.12]  and they were like
[4868.12 --> 4868.50]  yeah we're gonna
[4868.50 --> 4869.14]  remove DRM
[4869.14 --> 4869.80]  by not removing
[4869.80 --> 4870.30]  DRM
[4870.30 --> 4871.78]  this is their
[4871.78 --> 4872.24]  solution
[4872.24 --> 4874.80]  more microtransactions
[4874.80 --> 4875.98]  because hopefully
[4875.98 --> 4876.62]  you can't pirate
[4876.62 --> 4877.06]  those
[4877.06 --> 4879.32]  you know what
[4879.32 --> 4880.44]  I actually
[4880.44 --> 4880.90]  I mean
[4880.90 --> 4881.58]  this was moved
[4881.58 --> 4882.38]  into uh
[4882.38 --> 4883.30]  rapid fire topics
[4883.30 --> 4884.08]  but I thought
[4884.08 --> 4884.74]  it was actually
[4884.74 --> 4885.64]  a pretty interesting
[4885.64 --> 4886.10]  we were more
[4886.10 --> 4886.46]  just running
[4886.46 --> 4887.00]  out of time
[4887.00 --> 4888.04]  to be completely
[4888.04 --> 4888.36]  honest
[4888.36 --> 4889.22]  oh okay
[4889.22 --> 4889.92]  that one was
[4889.92 --> 4890.34]  a fairly
[4890.34 --> 4890.76]  yeah
[4890.76 --> 4891.86]  where's that
[4891.86 --> 4892.96]  bloody hell
[4892.96 --> 4893.38]  what are you
[4893.38 --> 4893.64]  looking for
[4893.64 --> 4893.92]  I'm looking
[4893.92 --> 4894.48]  for that EA
[4894.48 --> 4894.92]  article
[4894.92 --> 4896.56]  where they were
[4896.56 --> 4897.82]  basically justifying
[4897.82 --> 4898.84]  microtransactions
[4898.84 --> 4899.70]  saying that
[4899.70 --> 4900.18]  uh
[4900.18 --> 4901.00]  core gamers
[4901.00 --> 4901.48]  uncomfortable
[4901.48 --> 4901.94]  with change
[4901.94 --> 4902.72]  yeah there it is
[4902.72 --> 4902.94]  yeah
[4902.94 --> 4903.70]  Peter Moore
[4903.70 --> 4904.32]  from EA
[4904.32 --> 4905.00]  comes out
[4905.00 --> 4905.32]  saying
[4905.32 --> 4906.04]  core gamers
[4906.04 --> 4906.70]  are uncomfortable
[4906.70 --> 4907.46]  with change
[4907.46 --> 4908.30]  and that's
[4908.30 --> 4908.94]  basically the
[4908.94 --> 4909.72]  reason that
[4909.72 --> 4910.62]  people are
[4910.62 --> 4911.64]  are upset
[4911.64 --> 4913.10]  about the changing
[4913.10 --> 4913.62]  landscape
[4913.62 --> 4914.70]  which would be
[4914.70 --> 4915.84]  mobile gaming
[4915.84 --> 4917.22]  microtransactions
[4917.22 --> 4918.54]  and like
[4918.54 --> 4919.62]  I see
[4919.62 --> 4921.06]  I see why
[4921.06 --> 4921.84]  people don't like it
[4921.84 --> 4922.70]  and he acknowledges
[4922.70 --> 4923.82]  why people don't like it
[4923.82 --> 4924.52]  and says you know what
[4924.52 --> 4925.42]  it's totally fair
[4925.42 --> 4926.56]  to not like it
[4926.56 --> 4927.86]  but he just kind of says
[4927.86 --> 4928.36]  well look
[4928.36 --> 4929.48]  I think that
[4929.48 --> 4930.98]  what we have to understand
[4930.98 --> 4932.12]  is that
[4932.12 --> 4933.30]  that's the way
[4933.30 --> 4934.32]  the industry is going
[4934.32 --> 4936.12]  and all you have to
[4936.12 --> 4936.76]  really do
[4936.76 --> 4938.16]  is look at
[4938.16 --> 4939.08]  companies that are
[4939.08 --> 4940.04]  just trying to
[4940.04 --> 4940.96]  maintain that
[4940.96 --> 4941.66]  traditional
[4941.66 --> 4943.52]  $60 title
[4943.52 --> 4945.14]  mindset
[4945.14 --> 4946.00]  we're going to
[4946.00 --> 4947.32]  sell you a $60 title
[4947.32 --> 4948.52]  and then everything else
[4948.52 --> 4949.26]  is just going to
[4949.26 --> 4949.76]  kind of
[4949.76 --> 4950.48]  you know
[4950.48 --> 4950.90]  we're going to
[4950.90 --> 4952.08]  do it the old way
[4952.08 --> 4953.34]  and gamers
[4953.34 --> 4954.42]  aren't necessarily
[4954.42 --> 4955.46]  satisfied when that
[4955.46 --> 4955.86]  happens
[4955.86 --> 4956.44]  I mean look at
[4956.44 --> 4956.84]  I don't know if that's
[4956.84 --> 4957.52]  necessarily the truth
[4957.52 --> 4958.40]  because it seems like
[4958.40 --> 4959.16]  what gamers are very
[4959.16 --> 4960.02]  unsatisfied about
[4960.02 --> 4960.90]  is being hit with
[4960.90 --> 4962.06]  both at the same time
[4962.06 --> 4963.84]  that's a good point
[4963.84 --> 4964.36]  because like
[4964.36 --> 4964.82]  look at
[4964.82 --> 4965.60]  CD Projekt Red
[4965.60 --> 4967.02]  I don't see anyone
[4967.02 --> 4968.20]  complaining about Witcher
[4968.20 --> 4969.02]  I don't see Witcher
[4969.02 --> 4970.06]  having any problems
[4970.06 --> 4971.12]  that's true
[4971.12 --> 4971.88]  that's a good point
[4971.88 --> 4972.24]  and they're like
[4972.24 --> 4973.08]  the only ones
[4973.08 --> 4973.68]  that are actually
[4973.68 --> 4975.22]  doing just one attack
[4975.22 --> 4976.36]  everyone else is like
[4976.36 --> 4977.60]  $60 title
[4977.60 --> 4978.74]  here's a butt ton
[4978.74 --> 4979.18]  of DLC
[4979.18 --> 4980.48]  also by the way
[4980.48 --> 4981.24]  microtransactions
[4981.24 --> 4981.74]  on the side
[4981.74 --> 4982.42]  it's not fair to say
[4982.42 --> 4983.12]  everyone else
[4983.12 --> 4983.88]  I mean you know
[4983.88 --> 4984.72]  there are MMOs
[4984.72 --> 4985.74]  that just have
[4985.74 --> 4986.24]  a subscription
[4986.24 --> 4987.40]  there are
[4987.40 --> 4987.96]  which one
[4987.96 --> 4988.86]  actually a lot of them
[4988.86 --> 4989.68]  have microtransactions
[4989.68 --> 4990.40]  now okay forget it
[4990.40 --> 4991.62]  Eve has microtransactions
[4991.62 --> 4993.10]  WoW has a microtransaction
[4993.10 --> 4993.86]  where you can make
[4993.86 --> 4994.32]  your character
[4994.32 --> 4994.96]  max level
[4994.96 --> 4997.48]  like I actually
[4997.48 --> 4999.08]  that's quite serious
[4999.08 --> 4999.68]  when I said which one
[4999.68 --> 5000.54]  the only one I can
[5000.54 --> 5001.68]  the issue
[5001.68 --> 5003.02]  with the traditional way
[5003.02 --> 5004.34]  with no microtransactions
[5004.34 --> 5005.36]  so with just paying
[5005.36 --> 5006.22]  for it up front
[5006.22 --> 5007.34]  is that
[5007.34 --> 5008.32]  gamers are going to be
[5008.32 --> 5009.58]  ultimately unsatisfied
[5009.58 --> 5010.44]  when that company
[5010.44 --> 5011.64]  can't afford to support
[5011.64 --> 5012.30]  the multiplayer
[5012.30 --> 5013.52]  anymore for example
[5013.52 --> 5014.72]  and the servers
[5014.72 --> 5015.64]  end up getting shut down
[5015.64 --> 5016.64]  now the obvious
[5016.64 --> 5017.46]  solution to this
[5017.46 --> 5018.12]  is they should let us
[5018.12 --> 5018.76]  run our own servers
[5018.76 --> 5019.62]  in the first place
[5019.62 --> 5020.44]  but
[5020.44 --> 5023.52]  I don't know
[5023.52 --> 5024.46]  maybe if they just
[5024.46 --> 5026.08]  give something back
[5026.08 --> 5029.26]  my favorite thing
[5029.26 --> 5030.20]  posted on this thread
[5030.20 --> 5031.16]  okay this topic
[5031.16 --> 5032.28]  is just making me sad
[5032.28 --> 5032.96]  my favorite thing
[5032.96 --> 5033.72]  posted on this thread
[5033.72 --> 5034.30]  was that
[5034.30 --> 5036.44]  what's the principle
[5036.44 --> 5037.22]  in the Simpsons
[5037.22 --> 5038.12]  Skinner
[5038.12 --> 5039.60]  yeah yeah yeah yeah
[5039.60 --> 5040.98]  am I out of touch
[5040.98 --> 5041.56]  no
[5041.56 --> 5042.74]  it's the people
[5042.74 --> 5043.28]  that are wrong
[5043.28 --> 5044.06]  it's the children
[5044.06 --> 5044.56]  that are wrong
[5044.56 --> 5044.78]  it's the children
[5044.78 --> 5045.40]  that are wrong
[5045.40 --> 5046.62]  it's like
[5046.62 --> 5047.54]  actually no
[5047.54 --> 5048.82]  you're just wrong
[5048.82 --> 5049.92]  attacking people
[5049.92 --> 5051.12]  on every possible front
[5051.12 --> 5051.54]  DLC
[5051.54 --> 5052.34]  full price game
[5052.34 --> 5053.14]  microtransactions
[5053.14 --> 5054.30]  and possibly even
[5054.30 --> 5054.78]  a subscription
[5054.78 --> 5055.80]  is not the way
[5055.80 --> 5056.34]  to make a happy
[5056.34 --> 5056.70]  customer
[5056.70 --> 5057.82]  okay he does
[5057.82 --> 5058.76]  make a good point
[5058.76 --> 5060.10]  about customers
[5060.10 --> 5061.76]  being willing to
[5061.76 --> 5063.06]  give money in this
[5063.06 --> 5064.12]  way and therefore
[5064.12 --> 5064.88]  as a business
[5064.88 --> 5065.44]  if you want to
[5065.44 --> 5066.74]  survive you have
[5066.74 --> 5067.62]  to leverage that
[5067.62 --> 5068.48]  that also doesn't
[5068.48 --> 5068.94]  need to be all
[5068.94 --> 5069.36]  your games
[5069.36 --> 5070.30]  and that's true
[5070.30 --> 5070.90]  it doesn't need
[5070.90 --> 5071.30]  to be all your
[5071.30 --> 5072.64]  games but you
[5072.64 --> 5073.36]  have to look at
[5073.36 --> 5074.00]  the success of
[5074.00 --> 5074.50]  something like
[5074.50 --> 5075.50]  Candy Crush Saga
[5075.50 --> 5077.14]  and go if
[5077.14 --> 5077.76]  Linus Media
[5077.76 --> 5078.32]  but that's one thing
[5078.32 --> 5078.98]  like I don't see
[5078.98 --> 5079.76]  anyone complaining
[5079.76 --> 5080.60]  that mobile games
[5080.60 --> 5081.62]  exist I've never
[5081.62 --> 5082.20]  heard of that
[5082.20 --> 5082.92]  complaint
[5082.92 --> 5084.30]  I would complain
[5084.30 --> 5085.22]  about Candy Crush
[5085.22 --> 5086.28]  Saga's implementation
[5086.28 --> 5087.34]  of microtransactions
[5087.34 --> 5088.26]  no I mean
[5088.26 --> 5089.00]  mobile games
[5089.00 --> 5089.90]  in general
[5089.90 --> 5090.44]  oh yeah I'm not
[5090.44 --> 5090.90]  complaining that
[5090.90 --> 5091.60]  they exist
[5091.60 --> 5092.38]  I'm just
[5092.38 --> 5093.28]  it's more of an
[5093.28 --> 5093.90]  like his
[5093.90 --> 5095.06]  quotes here
[5095.06 --> 5095.34]  are actually
[5095.34 --> 5095.78]  pretty good
[5095.78 --> 5096.66]  it's more of an
[5096.66 --> 5097.34]  observation
[5097.34 --> 5098.62]  that this is
[5098.62 --> 5099.34]  really successful
[5099.34 --> 5100.82]  and as much
[5100.82 --> 5101.58]  as that
[5101.58 --> 5102.32]  old
[5102.32 --> 5102.98]  you know
[5102.98 --> 5103.66]  that old
[5103.66 --> 5104.30]  guard's
[5104.30 --> 5105.02]  core audience
[5105.02 --> 5105.64]  of the more
[5105.64 --> 5106.40]  hardcore gamers
[5106.40 --> 5107.34]  doesn't like it
[5107.34 --> 5108.80]  new gamers
[5108.80 --> 5110.92]  are being brought
[5110.92 --> 5111.72]  in onto the
[5111.72 --> 5112.46]  gaming scene
[5112.46 --> 5113.76]  used to that
[5113.76 --> 5114.50]  but you can do
[5114.50 --> 5115.34]  it in good ways
[5115.34 --> 5115.70]  I don't know
[5115.70 --> 5116.18]  that many people
[5116.18 --> 5116.74]  that complain
[5116.74 --> 5117.34]  about the
[5117.34 --> 5118.16]  microtransactions
[5118.16 --> 5118.82]  in League of Legends
[5118.82 --> 5120.16]  I never have
[5120.16 --> 5121.44]  I've found them
[5121.44 --> 5122.24]  to be completely fine
[5122.24 --> 5122.92]  and I personally
[5122.92 --> 5123.50]  know someone who
[5123.50 --> 5124.14]  spent like two
[5124.14 --> 5125.00]  grand on League of Legends
[5125.00 --> 5125.88]  and Team Fortress 2
[5125.88 --> 5126.42]  is another great
[5126.42 --> 5126.76]  example
[5126.76 --> 5127.18]  and Team Fortress 2
[5127.18 --> 5128.04]  fine
[5128.04 --> 5129.12]  totally fine
[5129.12 --> 5129.96]  Counter-Strike
[5129.96 --> 5131.18]  I've spent an okay
[5131.18 --> 5131.70]  amount of money
[5131.70 --> 5132.36]  on Counter-Strike
[5132.36 --> 5133.46]  just opening freaking
[5133.46 --> 5134.16]  cases because I'm
[5134.16 --> 5134.62]  an idiot
[5134.62 --> 5136.70]  it's not like
[5136.70 --> 5137.62]  okay amount of money
[5137.62 --> 5138.48]  is not that much
[5138.48 --> 5139.36]  I haven't spent that much
[5139.36 --> 5140.36]  usually it's
[5140.36 --> 5141.30]  I'll spend what I get
[5141.30 --> 5142.62]  off of selling the cards
[5142.62 --> 5143.34]  okay
[5143.34 --> 5144.58]  you know how you get
[5144.58 --> 5144.90]  the cards
[5144.90 --> 5145.64]  you can sell the cards
[5145.64 --> 5145.86]  no
[5145.86 --> 5147.10]  I have never
[5147.10 --> 5148.58]  I actually believe
[5148.58 --> 5150.40]  I own Team Fortress 2
[5150.40 --> 5150.76]  items
[5150.76 --> 5151.76]  I have never once
[5151.76 --> 5152.62]  looked at them
[5152.62 --> 5154.24]  I haven't for Team Fortress
[5154.24 --> 5155.24]  well I've looked at them
[5155.24 --> 5155.76]  I'm just saying
[5155.76 --> 5156.28]  I have
[5156.28 --> 5158.24]  the one time
[5158.24 --> 5158.64]  I have
[5158.64 --> 5158.92]  while you play
[5158.92 --> 5160.20]  a lot of games now
[5160.20 --> 5160.58]  on Steam
[5160.58 --> 5161.14]  you gain these
[5161.14 --> 5162.10]  trading card things
[5162.10 --> 5163.00]  and you can sell them
[5163.00 --> 5164.28]  for Steam bucks
[5164.28 --> 5165.32]  and you can spend
[5165.32 --> 5166.16]  that Steam money
[5166.16 --> 5167.24]  buying a key
[5167.24 --> 5168.26]  which will open a box
[5168.26 --> 5168.92]  which you can then
[5168.92 --> 5170.16]  probably sell the item from
[5170.16 --> 5171.00]  because it's probably
[5171.00 --> 5171.80]  not even good
[5171.80 --> 5174.42]  it has been
[5174.42 --> 5175.08]  proven
[5175.08 --> 5175.74]  that it is
[5175.74 --> 5176.82]  much more
[5176.82 --> 5177.48]  cost effective
[5177.48 --> 5178.58]  to just buy the item
[5178.58 --> 5179.42]  than to buy the key
[5179.42 --> 5180.08]  to open the box
[5180.08 --> 5181.26]  because the chance
[5181.26 --> 5181.66]  of something
[5181.66 --> 5182.64]  coming out of that box
[5182.64 --> 5183.34]  that is worth anything
[5183.34 --> 5184.44]  is so low
[5184.44 --> 5188.20]  like insanely low
[5188.20 --> 5188.96]  people have even
[5188.96 --> 5189.54]  made websites
[5189.54 --> 5190.08]  that are
[5190.08 --> 5190.84]  that are dedicated
[5190.84 --> 5191.46]  to like
[5191.46 --> 5192.68]  capturing the experience
[5192.68 --> 5193.46]  of opening the box
[5193.46 --> 5194.42]  so you get infinite keys
[5194.42 --> 5194.90]  and a box
[5194.90 --> 5195.40]  and it's a random
[5195.40 --> 5196.02]  number generator
[5196.02 --> 5196.56]  that'll be like
[5196.56 --> 5197.32]  you got this item
[5197.32 --> 5198.06]  so it can prove
[5198.06 --> 5198.94]  how much you've lost
[5198.94 --> 5200.46]  like yeah
[5200.46 --> 5201.58]  it's not worth it
[5201.58 --> 5202.20]  even if you wanted
[5202.20 --> 5203.08]  to buy like a $60
[5203.08 --> 5204.06]  rifle skin
[5204.06 --> 5205.50]  it's better to just
[5205.50 --> 5206.02]  buy it
[5206.02 --> 5207.02]  than open that many
[5207.02 --> 5207.42]  boxes
[5207.42 --> 5209.56]  so basically
[5209.56 --> 5210.62]  it's Pokemon cards
[5210.62 --> 5211.34]  all over again
[5211.34 --> 5211.72]  yeah
[5211.72 --> 5212.50]  okay
[5212.50 --> 5214.06]  don't buy the booster
[5214.06 --> 5214.40]  packs
[5214.40 --> 5215.08]  just buy the damn
[5215.08 --> 5215.42]  card
[5215.42 --> 5216.26]  but then actually
[5216.26 --> 5217.12]  just don't buy either
[5217.12 --> 5219.36]  and then there you go
[5219.36 --> 5221.08]  the best part
[5221.08 --> 5221.64]  the coolest
[5221.64 --> 5221.94]  sorry
[5221.94 --> 5222.92]  the coolest part
[5222.92 --> 5223.20]  I've seen
[5223.20 --> 5223.76]  is when me and my
[5223.76 --> 5224.40]  friends will be playing
[5224.40 --> 5225.16]  and someone will
[5225.16 --> 5225.78]  accidentally take
[5225.78 --> 5226.28]  one of the skins
[5226.28 --> 5226.86]  off of one of their
[5226.86 --> 5227.16]  rifles
[5227.16 --> 5227.60]  and they're like
[5227.60 --> 5228.60]  whoa it looks cool
[5228.60 --> 5232.12]  it's like blackout
[5232.12 --> 5233.94]  because it's all black
[5233.94 --> 5238.54]  everyone has so many skins
[5238.54 --> 5239.68]  that once the skins
[5239.68 --> 5240.22]  come off
[5240.22 --> 5240.88]  and you just see
[5240.88 --> 5241.84]  the blacked out gun
[5241.84 --> 5242.42]  it actually looks
[5242.42 --> 5242.94]  pretty cool
[5242.94 --> 5244.08]  I'm like
[5244.08 --> 5244.62]  wow
[5244.62 --> 5246.24]  you're giving me
[5246.24 --> 5246.84]  such a headache
[5246.84 --> 5247.56]  right now
[5247.56 --> 5250.72]  it doesn't help
[5250.72 --> 5251.18]  that it's like
[5251.18 --> 5251.92]  insanely hot
[5251.92 --> 5252.38]  in this room
[5252.38 --> 5253.34]  alright
[5253.34 --> 5254.30]  you wanted to move on
[5254.30 --> 5254.88]  I think this has been
[5254.88 --> 5255.74]  our worst show
[5255.74 --> 5256.54]  in a long time
[5256.54 --> 5257.48]  and yet there are
[5257.48 --> 5258.58]  4,800 people
[5258.58 --> 5259.14]  watching it
[5259.14 --> 5259.50]  I don't think it's been
[5259.50 --> 5260.24]  the worst show
[5260.24 --> 5261.08]  you're just sad
[5261.08 --> 5261.92]  that doesn't mean
[5261.92 --> 5263.22]  it's the worst show
[5263.22 --> 5266.00]  I guess if they just
[5266.00 --> 5266.68]  want to watch me
[5266.68 --> 5267.24]  be sad
[5267.24 --> 5267.66]  and angry
[5267.66 --> 5269.64]  and your shirt
[5269.64 --> 5270.16]  came off
[5270.16 --> 5271.02]  and my shirt
[5271.02 --> 5271.60]  did come off
[5271.60 --> 5275.10]  my shirt came off
[5275.10 --> 5276.94]  during probably the worst
[5276.94 --> 5277.96]  sponsor integration
[5277.96 --> 5279.26]  that I've ever done
[5279.26 --> 5280.18]  it's like
[5280.18 --> 5281.74]  you spent the whole time
[5281.74 --> 5282.54]  looking for the
[5282.54 --> 5283.44]  okay guys
[5283.44 --> 5283.94]  here
[5283.94 --> 5285.14]  I don't do this often
[5285.14 --> 5286.42]  but please
[5286.42 --> 5287.96]  if you want
[5287.96 --> 5289.32]  a subscription clothing
[5289.32 --> 5289.92]  service
[5289.92 --> 5291.28]  please go check out
[5291.28 --> 5291.98]  5-4 club
[5291.98 --> 5292.68]  because otherwise
[5292.68 --> 5293.88]  they are going to drop
[5293.88 --> 5294.96]  me so hard
[5294.96 --> 5295.92]  because that was
[5295.92 --> 5296.76]  terrible
[5296.76 --> 5299.50]  I said some numbers
[5299.50 --> 5299.96]  that are wrong
[5299.96 --> 5300.96]  so I'm going to buy time
[5300.96 --> 5301.70]  and look through emails
[5301.70 --> 5303.76]  and eventually
[5303.76 --> 5304.62]  I'll find it
[5304.62 --> 5305.48]  and I couldn't find
[5305.48 --> 5306.02]  the email
[5306.02 --> 5308.04]  I'm not going to send them
[5308.04 --> 5309.04]  this part of the video
[5309.04 --> 5310.56]  so they're just going to
[5310.56 --> 5311.84]  have to be amazed
[5311.84 --> 5312.60]  at like
[5312.60 --> 5313.54]  how many people
[5313.54 --> 5314.66]  signed up for a trial
[5314.66 --> 5315.28]  of 5-4 club
[5315.28 --> 5316.68]  it really is a good deal
[5316.68 --> 5317.98]  with the $20 off deal
[5317.98 --> 5318.46]  right now
[5318.46 --> 5320.52]  so check it out
[5320.52 --> 5321.10]  okay
[5321.10 --> 5322.88]  it's $120
[5322.88 --> 5324.46]  MSRP worth of clothing
[5324.46 --> 5325.70]  for $40
[5325.70 --> 5326.76]  and if you sign up
[5326.76 --> 5327.44]  for $120
[5327.44 --> 5327.98]  MSRP
[5327.98 --> 5328.36]  because you get
[5328.36 --> 5329.12]  the $20 off
[5329.12 --> 5329.70]  so it's $40
[5329.70 --> 5330.88]  so it's $40
[5330.88 --> 5331.92]  you should
[5331.92 --> 5332.68]  just try it
[5332.68 --> 5333.34]  for one month
[5333.34 --> 5333.94]  because otherwise
[5333.94 --> 5335.10]  I'm going to look terrible
[5335.10 --> 5336.28]  whereas if like
[5336.28 --> 5337.08]  I do the worst
[5337.08 --> 5338.02]  integration ever
[5338.02 --> 5338.92]  and the results
[5338.92 --> 5339.52]  are amazing
[5339.52 --> 5340.52]  they're going to be like
[5340.52 --> 5341.10]  wow
[5341.10 --> 5342.14]  we should probably
[5342.14 --> 5342.76]  do more of those
[5342.76 --> 5342.98]  yeah
[5342.98 --> 5343.32]  we should
[5343.32 --> 5343.84]  we should like
[5343.84 --> 5345.12]  we should have them
[5345.12 --> 5345.68]  screw it up
[5345.68 --> 5346.20]  all the time
[5346.20 --> 5347.98]  we'll purposely
[5347.98 --> 5348.62]  give them the wrong
[5348.62 --> 5349.28]  numbers now
[5349.28 --> 5349.92]  it won't matter
[5349.92 --> 5350.34]  you probably won't
[5350.34 --> 5350.64]  remember
[5350.64 --> 5351.76]  it's okay
[5351.76 --> 5353.54]  oh I'm just a bad
[5353.54 --> 5354.16]  person I guess
[5354.16 --> 5355.52]  okay so this is posted
[5355.52 --> 5355.96]  on the forum
[5355.96 --> 5357.32]  by Symbolizer21
[5357.32 --> 5358.48]  and the original
[5358.48 --> 5359.10]  article is from
[5359.10 --> 5359.94]  geek.com
[5359.94 --> 5360.30]  it's going to be
[5360.30 --> 5361.34]  approximately $70
[5361.34 --> 5363.38]  and as much as
[5363.38 --> 5364.10]  this is like
[5364.10 --> 5365.02]  kind of cool
[5365.02 --> 5367.08]  I don't think
[5367.08 --> 5368.00]  it's necessarily
[5368.00 --> 5368.80]  very smart
[5368.80 --> 5369.60]  this is like
[5369.60 --> 5371.08]  it's like
[5371.08 --> 5372.68]  a cooler
[5372.68 --> 5374.08]  it's got 62 feet
[5374.08 --> 5374.68]  of heat pipes
[5374.68 --> 5375.30]  in it apparently
[5375.30 --> 5376.46]  which is just
[5376.46 --> 5377.52]  expensive
[5377.52 --> 5378.56]  for no reason
[5378.56 --> 5379.74]  like
[5379.74 --> 5381.02]  heat pipes
[5381.02 --> 5381.88]  are good
[5381.88 --> 5382.74]  for carrying
[5382.74 --> 5383.60]  heat somewhere
[5383.60 --> 5384.78]  they're actually
[5384.78 --> 5385.72]  not very good
[5385.72 --> 5386.40]  for dissipating
[5386.40 --> 5387.08]  it to the air
[5387.08 --> 5389.22]  a cylinder
[5389.22 --> 5390.16]  is actually
[5390.16 --> 5391.10]  very efficient
[5391.10 --> 5392.26]  from an internal
[5392.26 --> 5393.38]  volume to
[5393.38 --> 5394.24]  external surface
[5394.24 --> 5395.18]  area perspective
[5395.18 --> 5396.22]  not because it
[5396.22 --> 5396.74]  has a lot of
[5396.74 --> 5397.40]  surface area
[5397.40 --> 5398.10]  and very little
[5398.10 --> 5398.62]  internal volume
[5398.62 --> 5398.94]  it's the other
[5398.94 --> 5399.32]  way around
[5399.32 --> 5401.30]  so it has
[5401.30 --> 5401.76]  very little
[5401.76 --> 5402.48]  surface area
[5402.48 --> 5403.12]  but it has
[5403.12 --> 5403.40]  a lot of
[5403.40 --> 5403.98]  heat pipes
[5403.98 --> 5404.76]  and it's just
[5404.76 --> 5405.08]  like
[5405.08 --> 5405.84]  okay
[5405.84 --> 5406.80]  so the company
[5406.80 --> 5407.44]  recommends it
[5407.44 --> 5408.16]  for Core i3s
[5408.16 --> 5408.92]  and Core i5s
[5408.92 --> 5409.56]  only but not
[5409.56 --> 5410.48]  Core i7s
[5410.48 --> 5411.38]  and the thing
[5411.38 --> 5411.86]  that people
[5411.86 --> 5412.90]  need to remember
[5412.90 --> 5414.08]  about passive
[5414.08 --> 5414.62]  coolers
[5414.62 --> 5415.38]  is that they're
[5415.38 --> 5415.96]  just basically
[5415.96 --> 5417.00]  all a bad idea
[5417.00 --> 5418.82]  because a passive
[5418.82 --> 5419.28]  cooler
[5419.28 --> 5420.88]  you would only
[5420.88 --> 5422.28]  use if you want
[5422.28 --> 5423.02]  to have like
[5423.02 --> 5423.58]  an extremely
[5423.58 --> 5424.44]  silent pc
[5424.44 --> 5425.84]  and if you have
[5425.84 --> 5426.26]  an extremely
[5426.26 --> 5427.10]  silent pc
[5427.10 --> 5429.02]  then you probably
[5429.02 --> 5429.66]  have a mostly
[5429.66 --> 5430.52]  passive rest
[5430.52 --> 5431.08]  of your system
[5431.08 --> 5431.96]  and passive
[5431.96 --> 5433.12]  coolers are not
[5433.12 --> 5433.98]  designed to work
[5433.98 --> 5435.18]  correctly without
[5435.18 --> 5436.08]  system cooling
[5436.08 --> 5436.58]  around them
[5436.58 --> 5437.98]  so it's like
[5437.98 --> 5439.16]  a catch-22
[5439.16 --> 5440.60]  you can't win
[5440.60 --> 5441.42]  so just focus
[5441.42 --> 5441.92]  on getting
[5441.92 --> 5443.80]  very quiet
[5443.80 --> 5444.42]  things
[5444.42 --> 5444.80]  everywhere
[5444.80 --> 5446.40]  extremely quiet
[5446.40 --> 5446.88]  things
[5446.88 --> 5447.76]  very low
[5447.76 --> 5448.98]  rpm spinning
[5448.98 --> 5449.78]  like noctua
[5449.78 --> 5450.10]  and noise
[5450.10 --> 5450.70]  blocker fans
[5450.70 --> 5451.12]  yeah
[5451.12 --> 5451.88]  by all the
[5451.88 --> 5452.22]  noctua
[5452.22 --> 5454.68]  i refuse to
[5454.68 --> 5455.32]  acknowledge noise
[5455.32 --> 5455.86]  blocker because
[5455.86 --> 5456.18]  they're not
[5456.18 --> 5456.54]  noctua
[5456.54 --> 5458.26]  no but seriously
[5458.26 --> 5458.82]  noise blocker
[5458.82 --> 5459.20]  stuff's really
[5459.20 --> 5459.40]  good
[5459.40 --> 5461.02]  i'm like
[5461.02 --> 5461.66]  what
[5461.66 --> 5462.60]  i just don't
[5462.60 --> 5463.56]  fanboy over it
[5463.56 --> 5464.24]  because you've
[5464.24 --> 5464.84]  never even tried
[5464.84 --> 5465.08]  them
[5465.08 --> 5466.02]  i actually haven't
[5466.02 --> 5466.72]  they've never
[5466.72 --> 5467.54]  contacted me
[5467.54 --> 5468.10]  i've never
[5468.10 --> 5468.92]  contacted them
[5468.92 --> 5469.38]  it's not
[5469.38 --> 5469.78]  it's not
[5469.78 --> 5470.24]  because we
[5470.24 --> 5470.60]  hate each
[5470.60 --> 5470.80]  other
[5470.80 --> 5471.26]  no i know
[5471.26 --> 5471.54]  i know
[5471.54 --> 5471.84]  i don't
[5471.84 --> 5472.28]  understand
[5472.28 --> 5472.96]  just is what
[5472.96 --> 5473.64]  it is
[5473.64 --> 5474.88]  um
[5474.88 --> 5475.26]  i don't know
[5475.26 --> 5475.78]  it's hard to
[5475.78 --> 5476.28]  beat the new
[5476.28 --> 5477.16]  industrial looking
[5477.16 --> 5478.00]  noctua fans
[5478.00 --> 5478.54]  they look kind
[5478.54 --> 5479.00]  of amazing
[5479.00 --> 5479.60]  yeah they do
[5479.60 --> 5479.98]  look kind of
[5479.98 --> 5480.80]  amazing but
[5480.80 --> 5481.66]  i fixed that
[5481.66 --> 5482.04]  problem
[5482.04 --> 5482.42]  might be able to
[5482.42 --> 5482.86]  beat it at some
[5482.86 --> 5483.68]  point um
[5483.68 --> 5484.42]  speaking of beating
[5484.42 --> 5485.32]  it i think that's
[5485.32 --> 5485.96]  pretty much it

[5628.18 --> 5629.78]  logan's giving away his too
[5629.78 --> 5631.42]  so stay tuned for that
[5631.42 --> 5632.92]  sometime in the next however long
[5632.92 --> 5634.62]  i think he's pretty busy right now
[5634.62 --> 5635.36]  so there you go
[5635.36 --> 5636.50]  people are asking
[5636.50 --> 5637.86]  is 5,000 viewers a lot
[5637.86 --> 5639.60]  i think so
[5639.60 --> 5640.38]  i think so
[5640.38 --> 5642.08]  if 5,000 people listen to me
[5642.08 --> 5642.88]  saying something
[5642.88 --> 5644.16]  how twitch works
[5644.16 --> 5644.90]  we're able to get a
[5644.90 --> 5646.00]  ton of viewers
[5646.00 --> 5646.78]  usually need to go
[5646.78 --> 5647.40]  for quite a while
[5647.40 --> 5648.20]  because it takes so long
[5648.20 --> 5649.08]  for the subscription email
[5649.08 --> 5649.56]  to go out
[5649.56 --> 5650.82]  so because we have
[5650.82 --> 5652.22]  a scheduled show
[5652.22 --> 5653.50]  that's very short
[5653.50 --> 5655.40]  it doesn't offer itself
[5655.40 --> 5655.64]  very long
[5655.64 --> 5656.30]  and you know what's funny
[5656.30 --> 5657.48]  is i didn't even tweet
[5657.48 --> 5658.40]  in the middle of the show
[5658.40 --> 5658.92]  to be like
[5658.92 --> 5660.24]  hey please come watch
[5660.24 --> 5662.08]  that usually helps a lot
[5662.08 --> 5662.72]  because the email
[5662.72 --> 5663.54]  doesn't freaking go out
[5663.54 --> 5664.36]  we're live right now
[5664.36 --> 5665.28]  i got people on my
[5665.28 --> 5666.42]  24 hour stream
[5666.42 --> 5668.16]  that were messaging me
[5668.16 --> 5669.20]  when it was over
[5669.20 --> 5670.68]  being like
[5670.68 --> 5671.96]  where are you
[5671.96 --> 5672.56]  this is kind of
[5672.56 --> 5673.52]  after party material
[5673.52 --> 5674.32]  right now isn't it
[5674.32 --> 5674.86]  yeah it is
[5674.86 --> 5675.42]  you know what
[5675.42 --> 5676.02]  i actually
[5676.02 --> 5676.62]  i don't think
[5676.62 --> 5677.20]  i don't
[5677.20 --> 5677.88]  what the hell
[5677.88 --> 5679.06]  what are they doing
[5679.06 --> 5680.02]  they're throwing freaking
[5680.02 --> 5681.24]  candy
[5681.24 --> 5682.54]  it's taron throwing
[5682.54 --> 5683.50]  candy at the window
[5683.50 --> 5687.10]  hey
[5687.10 --> 5689.98]  can you cut that out
[5689.98 --> 5691.24]  that actually sounds
[5691.24 --> 5692.00]  like it's like
[5692.00 --> 5693.12]  not good for the window
