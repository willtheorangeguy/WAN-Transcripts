[0.00 --> 6.16]  I also really like that Facebook has given us an official verified page
[6.16 --> 11.76]  whoa now that was a while ago Twitter apparently reserves it for like people
[11.76 --> 16.44]  that their employees notice yeah that's pretty much it like I know people that
[16.44 --> 21.68]  are verified that have like 2,000 followers yep yeah at Twitter there
[21.68 --> 25.44]  doesn't appear to be any kind of actual procedure for it nope yeah I knew that
[25.44 --> 30.24]  yeah so like if one of their followers knows some dude and he's like oh yeah
[30.24 --> 35.76]  that's you okay like that's honestly one of the ways that you can get verified the
[35.76 --> 41.10]  official policy is that aside from being like basically people who are at risk of
[41.10 --> 46.26]  being impersonated and I would argue that anyone you have been I'm sorry
[46.26 --> 50.40]  considering we have yeah I've reported plenty of impersonation on Twitter and
[50.40 --> 54.90]  they don't care and then one of the other things is you have to use the social
[54.90 --> 60.12]  platform correctly like in the way like first so Twitter is linked to other
[60.12 --> 63.78]  social platforms maybe that's part of the issue
[63.78 --> 68.82]  yeah we know why because Twitter is supposed to be about stream of
[68.82 --> 73.08]  consciousness so like what I'm doing right now whereas I don't do that I
[73.08 --> 78.36]  don't really do that whenever I think you're like terrible jokes they go on
[78.36 --> 90.12]  Twitter and whatever I'm like complaining about something like my favorite Twitter
[90.12 --> 96.00]  posts that I do are the ones where I'm having where I'm having like some random
[96.00 --> 101.16]  conversation with Yvonne and she burns me or I burn her like those are those are
[101.16 --> 105.96]  my favorites by far because it's just like yeah that happens yes I'm that
[105.96 --> 114.54]  awful and yes she's that awful and that's our life together we don't have
[114.54 --> 120.10]  to do it anymore okay did they just kill it or what I essentially okay that's
[120.10 --> 125.04]  fine so I think I'm not allowed to go shirtless on twitch so hopefully this nip
[125.04 --> 129.54]  slip here is not a big deal if I'm using it to change into a twitch shirt I think it's
[129.54 --> 132.66]  can I get away with it I think it technically is a big deal because
[132.66 --> 136.30]  they're going with the like yeah I know guys can't do it either thing right
[136.30 --> 143.10]  which is probably fair party bought which doesn't exist okay now hold on a second
[143.10 --> 149.78]  because I saw a lot of I saw a lot of discussion about guys streaming shirtless
[149.78 --> 155.22]  and girls streaming with like just cleavage hanging out all over the place
[155.22 --> 163.10]  what if a guy streamed with cleavage hanging out all over the place so a v-neck yeah like a super
[163.10 --> 171.62]  low-cut v-neck on a dude is that considered erotic to anyone I don't know to women like if there are
[171.62 --> 178.86]  any women watching I'm sure it's erotic to someone it might be yeah I need to know like if the dudes fit
[178.86 --> 184.54]  I'm sure it's erotic yeah but like what if it's a fairly tight fitting shirt and the dudes fit maybe
[184.54 --> 190.18]  it looks okay well tell me this like does it have to you know does it have to be in because is it okay
[190.18 --> 195.14]  is it an intention thing or what you're actually doing like if your intention is to be kind of gross
[195.14 --> 201.92]  hard to like if you put on a chest toupee like 70s style chest toupee and wear a v-neck the chest hair
[201.92 --> 206.78]  yeah like is that is that still considered attractive I don't know are you obviously
[206.78 --> 211.16]  just trying to be gross and I don't think it's a matter of what's attractive it's a matter of what
[211.16 --> 217.62]  they consider decent yeah I've got people saying that v-neck looks stupid I know it's not the point
[217.62 --> 223.98]  the conversation we're having um like I think certain v-necks are fine I don't like the like
[223.98 --> 231.28]  super low ones I actually prefer the shirts where it's a very shallow v-neck just because I like that
[231.28 --> 236.60]  next one more all right brookla says anything is going to be erotic to someone and this is a very
[236.60 --> 246.76]  good point um mcdude says or mike dude says uh why are people such prudes well because someone else
[246.76 --> 254.36]  who complains really loudly is an even bigger prude and the prudes because the internet is like
[254.36 --> 260.66]  mainstream now yeah I mean and I you know what I kind of get it like if you're trying to maintain a
[260.66 --> 266.02]  somewhat professional website you don't want like shirtless dudes yeah you don't want cleavage and
[266.02 --> 271.72]  shirtless dudes everywhere because that's not professional and that's not you can call it prude or
[271.72 --> 276.44]  you can call it whatever you want but it what it isn't is professional you know it's the classic no
[276.44 --> 282.70]  shirt no shoes no service that's the way the world works and what about no pants yeah like there are
[282.70 --> 290.20]  plenty of websites that are not twitch where you can go to look at boobs in streams so yeah
[290.20 --> 296.86]  live streams either or or or presumably having not looked into this I wouldn't be an expert on it
[296.86 --> 304.26]  presumably not boobs in streams so apparently Linus and Luke should do a WAN show in latex
[304.26 --> 309.66]  I will be doing a uh a body paint upper body episode soon that shipped by the way
[309.66 --> 314.72]  so okay yeah so it's not here yet have we figured out my costume for the girls thing
[314.72 --> 323.10]  is it showing up yeah if you don't get the things to then just go to uh let's go to the shop there
[323.10 --> 326.98]  that's what I was gonna do to get the things yeah yeah just don't want to wait two weeks for damn
[326.98 --> 333.16]  Amazon yeah well it's Christmas season who knows if it'll even show up until after Christmas we're
[333.16 --> 339.00]  already in December yeah we're gonna have to get it locally apparently people are saying yet twitch
[339.00 --> 345.94]  has insta-partnered with known porn stars okay you could but twitch would probably insta-partner with
[345.94 --> 351.40]  any highly recognizable person as long as they're using the site within the guidelines yeah who cares if
[351.40 --> 356.52]  they're a porn star yeah I don't see why that matters not really relevant yeah pretty much
[356.52 --> 362.56]  um twitch states that they want to keep the website about the games and not what people are or are not
[362.56 --> 370.90]  wearing and yeah I totally get that twitch doesn't need to be you know live cams rs central I mean yes
[370.90 --> 377.06]  they're live and there are cameras involved I think you know what I meant yes let's keep it gaming
[377.06 --> 383.16]  focused right guys apparently I shouldn't get glossy body paint it's worse to remove thank you for the
[383.16 --> 389.84]  pro tip I already bought it I have no idea what kind it is I'm not a body paint expert no body
[389.84 --> 394.98]  chocolate on the other hand I could probably tell you guys a thing or two industrial fondues
[394.98 --> 404.20]  yeah fondues body chocolate fondues for cucumbers would chocolate cucumber be good probably not
[404.20 --> 409.02]  probably not no chocolate doesn't go with everything what are we even talking about
[409.02 --> 415.98]  yeah it's like water and water yeah chocolate rain
[415.98 --> 421.94]  we're saying I should bust when you're talking about me singing or whatever they're like
[421.94 --> 426.34]  nick bust into the room i was like chocolate rain i was hoping you were gonna do something like it
[426.34 --> 431.54]  doesn't matter but that's why i yelled your name oh oh you yelled my name yeah i didn't say that
[431.54 --> 435.72]  loud because i didn't want it to peak the mic i was like half listening for the sponsor spots
[435.72 --> 439.14]  yeah yeah apparently it would be watery yeah it would be watery
[439.14 --> 447.78]  this was a heck of a week so we released oil cool part three we released curved surround part two
[447.78 --> 454.04]  the final the final one of that for something and tomorrow actually the number of people who were
[454.04 --> 462.72]  butthurt at you about saying maybe we're gonna have so many oh man yeah that is a butthurt fist
[462.72 --> 477.58]  um i almost shortened it but i was like no yeah okay so anyway he was just teasing just teasing
[477.58 --> 484.00]  and not just teasing like teasing upcoming content just teasing it is coming out tomorrow night so
[484.00 --> 491.22]  tomorrow night whole room water cooling part one will be up and i cannot hype this video enough i think
[491.22 --> 494.62]  i've heard him say offline behind camera that he thinks it might be one of the best things we've
[494.62 --> 498.82]  ever made i think it might be the best thing we've ever made ed still says don't hype it up too much
[498.82 --> 504.00]  yeah ed says not to hype it but he's done a great job of it and i thought we're a hype machine
[504.00 --> 509.54]  yeah i thought it was great hopefully we don't ubisoft this hopefully it's actually great yeah it
[509.54 --> 514.12]  better be it is great you haven't seen it yet right no oh yeah it's it's done it's done it's
[514.12 --> 519.28]  uploaded it would have been awesome if he had ubisoft it and like she's coming in just like eyes and mouth
[519.28 --> 522.52]  bring air on minus his face for like one frame
[522.52 --> 530.34]  that would actually be pretty funny so i can't promise how quickly the additional episodes are
[530.34 --> 536.06]  coming but we have all the footage we need for episodes two and three they're just extremely
[536.06 --> 541.62]  time consuming to make and we still need vo for two and we still need voiceovers uh for some of them
[541.62 --> 549.64]  and then it's not strictly speaking done because not only did we never finish some things like the
[549.64 --> 554.18]  vinyl decals on the wall stuff didn't we or something happened no no no no no um but we've
[554.18 --> 558.54]  had we had some challenges with putting quick disconnect fittings on all the systems so we have
[558.54 --> 564.64]  to finish off all the systems so they can actually be disconnected from the whole room loop um and then
[564.64 --> 569.24]  we still have to put some vinyl decals on the wall and the power supply for the fans for the roof
[569.24 --> 575.42]  mounted radiator died after like a couple days because it was just some cheapo like it doesn't
[575.42 --> 581.04]  matter made in china like yeah but the cool thing about it and maybe we'll cover this in more depth
[581.04 --> 586.78]  in the video is it's working without fans yeah yeah yeah one thing okay i didn't realize that there was
[586.78 --> 592.52]  like cool decals and stuff inside the box of the loot crate thing and the outside is like super plain
[592.52 --> 600.12]  and the inside's like cool stuff anyways oh can you like did he you did oh that's really look how tightly packed
[600.12 --> 603.88]  everything is and i was like does it unfold and become something that's what i was wondering because
[603.88 --> 609.64]  you can see inside the fold oh it totally does yeah there's a cut line here oh what what does it do
[610.60 --> 617.88]  share document enjoy i don't know because there's stuff under these folds in there you can see yeah here we
[617.88 --> 623.32]  should we should discover it while i'm talking but um like you're talking about putting the extra
[623.32 --> 628.76]  vinyls and stuff on the wall like aren't we moving soon i've got people asking for please no please more
[628.76 --> 634.52]  nips please more nips yeah not not today but i won't promise it'll never happen which is gonna ban us
[634.52 --> 640.92]  yeah twitch is gonna i'll get banned while i rep my twitch shirt oh my god i think there's other stuff in
[640.92 --> 647.80]  here did we not even notice all the stuff way to go lou hey man you were looking at it too are you a
[647.80 --> 652.60]  pirate or a ninja what does this say this month's theme is battle oh it has like a whole little
[652.60 --> 658.44]  like thing that goes along with it and there's like there's like little mega man and like ryu like
[658.44 --> 665.56]  pop out dudes that you can stand up and oh and maybe it's something to do is oh my goodness i get it
[665.56 --> 672.84]  i get it oh that's so sick it's a fight background oh nice so you put your little like dudes and they
[672.84 --> 677.96]  like stand on it oh i totally get it that's awesome i can't believe we missed this we're going to pay a
[677.96 --> 685.16]  lot more attention to that kind of stuff yeah and they screwed up the first one spot there's a freaking
[685.16 --> 692.60]  street fighter arcade edition full game oh there's a game code oh i don't want to show that there's a game
[692.60 --> 702.44]  code in here i'll show it like this there's a game code free game download street fighter 4 arcade
[702.44 --> 708.28]  this like folds out like way bigger than i originally showed it so fair this was supposed
[708.28 --> 713.48]  to be an unboxing spot so i don't think they expected you to like get it perfect all of these
[713.48 --> 718.68]  things well they probably expected us to find the stuff that was in the box when i saw the paper stuff
[718.68 --> 726.04]  i was like oh it's just ads and it's none of its ads yeah literally none of it is ads uh 50 off lichdom
[726.04 --> 733.64]  that's a pretty big discount i wouldn't consider that an ad that's cool huh so i wonder how much
[733.64 --> 739.00]  street and we suck is on steam it's probably like i don't think it's that expensive is it 20 bucks
[739.00 --> 745.16]  20 dollars shut up 20 value free game download so you pay 1337 you get all that cool stuff and you
[745.16 --> 751.32]  get a 20 dollar game yeah that's pretty insane yeah but you're a sales guy so we can't listen to you
[751.32 --> 760.60]  yeah eeeew ew business yeah all right i thought you were checking on steam i want to see if it's
[760.60 --> 764.04]  actually 20 dollars because like it it might have been 20 dollars when they printed those and it might
[764.04 --> 770.92]  be like two dollars now we'll see steam i'm i would check but i'm waiting for my uh my text to input
[770.92 --> 777.08]  really yeah i was it's it's loaded now i'm gonna find it before your wi-fi is so much better than
[777.08 --> 784.28]  mega rex what hot spot it's 30 dollars it's 30 bucks oh my god it's 29.99 we're in canada so maybe
[784.28 --> 790.60]  it's like maybe it's 1999 in the us interesting um i already got an email from our rep back just being
[790.60 --> 796.20]  like my team told me we're seeing a lot of awesome traffic to the site okay cool so apparently i screw
[796.20 --> 800.84]  everything up and i still succeed well seriously when i saw the papers in the bottom i was like
[800.84 --> 805.96]  oh here's junk and then it's like all awesome everyone who's still in the stream go over and
[805.96 --> 811.88]  check it out non-arcade edition i think is 20 bucks so they screwed up they screwed up and they put it
[811.88 --> 821.64]  to 20 value but it's the arcade edition oh this is this is ultra sorry wait what ultra oh is this ultra
[822.84 --> 829.08]  that's the arcade edition can buy this oh i get it i'm looking at ultra i might be looking at the wrong
[829.08 --> 834.20]  thing oh yeah yeah i think arcade edition is like the version before ultra it is you don't have one
[834.20 --> 840.04]  of the expansions or whatever yeah okay okay so where's our key edition i don't know if you can buy
[840.04 --> 847.16]  it i don't know it's still street fighter 4. there's like 18 versions of street yeah i just figured that
[847.16 --> 852.76]  out that's super weird ultra mega wait we can't use mega that's mega man and there's also mega man swag
[852.76 --> 860.44]  ultra super super mega man helmet man that thing's cool like i'm a huge mega man man so mega buster yeah
[860.44 --> 866.44]  and it's like not not super cheap and crappy either oh it's not in the box like it's fairly
[866.44 --> 872.44]  well constructed oh that's cool wow yeah that's actually has some weight to it yeah here's the stand
[872.44 --> 879.72]  okay well i'm gonna go home and eat yay it's been a really long day do you want to go get food
[882.52 --> 888.84]  do you want to go get food maybe let me check with the fam yeah should we go to the place yeah
[889.64 --> 894.04]  do the stuff and then i'll stream after i'm streaming tonight for anyone who's wondering should we should
[894.04 --> 899.88]  we stream lowbie instances i don't know someone asks when will linus read the comments
[899.88 --> 907.40]  i love those questions i love those like you never answer any of my tweets that's my favorite
[907.40 --> 912.44]  tweet to ever see um it's like well i'm answering this one not sure what you wanted to know
[913.96 --> 923.00]  this is the one i happened to see people are asking for vlogs no man no dude no bro i do vlogs
[923.00 --> 928.76]  vlogs of what i do vlogs whenever i do something that i think is particularly interesting vlogs of what
[928.76 --> 933.88]  probably have like moving vlogs and like yeah we'll probably do moving vlogs yeah well i think
[933.88 --> 937.88]  some of that could be interesting yeah how we plan to set up like the editor's room and stuff could we
[937.88 --> 943.56]  actually be cool breaking certain things and networking new things and yeah networking's gonna
[943.56 --> 949.32]  be really cool yeah um you might be getting that thing that you're talking about the switch we've
[949.32 --> 954.60]  basically which switch you weren't you you expressed interest a while back in a 10 gigabit switch
[954.60 --> 960.84]  yeah um it's not that unaffordable anymore i was i was shopping a little while ago and i think um net
[960.84 --> 968.60]  gear has a 12 port 10 gigabit ethernet so like an rj45 switch for 900 or something along those lines so
[968.60 --> 977.00]  we could go 10 gig at every editing station and uh to like a 20 gig backbone between the main switch and
[977.00 --> 981.80]  the server and i'm interested in who knows if we're going to do that really depends on what's available in
[981.80 --> 985.96]  the area but i'm interested in a load balancing appliance if we have to go that route because
[985.96 --> 990.84]  as far as i've been able to tell so far internet in that area is not great i'm assuming it's because
[991.72 --> 1000.52]  various companies that have warehouses aren't super worried about super fast internet yeah yeah i'm i'm
[1000.52 --> 1004.76]  hoping we can get something that's at least a touch better than what we have here and if we can't then
[1004.76 --> 1012.76]  we'll just have to live with it probably not yeah here keep all this stuff with the loot crate okay
[1012.76 --> 1018.84]  i'll just you know put it on my desk yeah dude since you guys steal my office to do this show yeah dude
[1019.96 --> 1026.28]  halo drop ship minifigure he doesn't even care i'm just gonna ignore that yeah
[1026.28 --> 1033.72]  so it like explains everything what does that say um i think this is ads this is that okay but it's
[1033.72 --> 1040.28]  not all ads yeah this is cool uh like an article about halo or something i like articles i miss
[1040.28 --> 1044.68]  reading things about games i miss old gaming magazines there's like an interview about uh
[1044.68 --> 1049.64]  assassin's creed from yeah with the creators of assassin's creed and you know what i've been doing a
[1049.64 --> 1054.44]  little bit more research on assassin's creed i'm still staying away from it for now um unity you mean yes
[1054.44 --> 1060.12]  sorry um but knowing me i'll play it eventually but my my whole thing that i've been doing a little
[1060.12 --> 1066.60]  bit research on is um like what the actual game is about not the performance issues because i have
[1066.60 --> 1072.68]  a feeling they'll eventually iron out the performance issues enough that it's somewhat playable um and
[1072.68 --> 1078.36]  apparently the game by itself is actually pretty damn good and especially the environments and art and
[1078.36 --> 1082.04]  stuff in the game is really good if you can freaking run it you hear the next one's in right
[1082.04 --> 1085.96]  or in london yeah i heard that that leaked we should have talked about that on the show yeah
[1086.52 --> 1092.04]  it was in there i need to spend a little bit more time on uh on narrowing down the topics for
[1092.04 --> 1097.48]  the show i think because um this week was kind of a mess this week was kind of all over the place
[1098.28 --> 1104.20]  the entire workflow this week was kind of oh i know this week was a total disaster for everyone
[1104.20 --> 1108.76]  watching this is more of an internal discussion but you guys can hear about it if you want yeah i burned
[1108.76 --> 1115.64]  probably 20 hours on the video that's coming out sunday night um i burned the majority of monday
[1115.64 --> 1120.76]  just handing badges out and like the one that's coming out sunday night i don't even know how many
[1120.76 --> 1125.32]  of you are going to be interested in it it's a video about a thousand dollar wireless access point
[1125.96 --> 1134.76]  um and basically my my original plan i had this like amazing plan to like he just got through some
[1134.76 --> 1141.24]  glitch in someone's system evidently um uh meraki access point it wasn't the glitch i know it wasn't
[1141.24 --> 1146.28]  a glitch but i'm sure they didn't intend for you to have one so whatever you want to call it he got
[1146.28 --> 1153.96]  maybe not but it wasn't the glitch he got like a 700 meraki like enterprise grade cloud managed access
[1153.96 --> 1159.00]  point i recently got this thousand dollar ruckus one and then i was going to take some high-end consumer
[1159.00 --> 1166.04]  grade stuff and i was going to like go full-on wi-fi testing and like i had so many issues with
[1166.04 --> 1172.28]  it that wi-fi testing is redonk you i already knew that but i learned it's more i did learn a lot
[1172.28 --> 1177.56]  and i have a methodology now that i think i could make work quite easily in the future but i need
[1178.20 --> 1182.44]  sorry i saw you running around doing stuff that made a lot of sense yeah i need i need different gear
[1182.44 --> 1187.80]  for it though and this is going to come as a bit of a sort of shocker i think i need a macbook pro
[1187.80 --> 1195.40]  yeah because macbook pro is the only laptop that i'm aware of that has three spatial stream ac wireless
[1195.40 --> 1203.00]  and so for me to actually get the most out of a three spatial stream ac wireless access point i need
[1203.00 --> 1209.64]  a client that i can move around easily to different locations to do range and obstacle testing so instead
[1209.64 --> 1214.44]  i had to use a phone so i used the droid turbo because that's the one that holds the record for me
[1214.44 --> 1222.04]  for at my house i have 100 megabit down uh internet and on n wireless that's the one that does the
[1222.04 --> 1228.44]  best throughput with um with the thousand dollar ap so that's the one that i decided to use for my testing
[1228.44 --> 1235.40]  i learned a lot about using iperf in the best possible way but there's still a lot more that needs to be done
[1235.40 --> 1240.84]  like the problem with iperf and the problem i was running into with my testing is i had to basically wait for a run
[1240.84 --> 1247.24]  where i was kind of getting consistent results because like a car would go by yeah um where's
[1247.24 --> 1253.56]  the way speed test works like speedtest.net is it throws away the outliers at the top and the bottom
[1253.56 --> 1259.32]  in order to give you that number of this is your typical speed whereas iperf unless you've got uh like
[1259.32 --> 1264.28]  something like and i haven't tried jperf yet but i will just as part of the learning process next time i
[1264.28 --> 1269.24]  tackle this if i do the problem with iperf is it just gives you a raw average of however long you
[1269.24 --> 1275.00]  run the test and i to my knowledge there isn't an easy way to export it at least from the the phone
[1275.00 --> 1282.28]  version that i'm using yeah so i need a better client hardware i need a better client software layer
[1282.28 --> 1286.52]  so that i can draw more meaningful results from it but i was able to get something that
[1286.52 --> 1293.08]  is somewhat meaningful especially in my load testing so wireless access points are not just about max
[1293.08 --> 1297.08]  speed from the access point to one client because that's not how anybody uses them nope and they're
[1297.08 --> 1302.76]  not about maximum range either because it's it's relevant but it's not necessarily how most people
[1302.76 --> 1310.28]  use them so i did a load test so like a stress test where i i think i ended up with six or seven clients
[1310.92 --> 1319.64]  all of which were streaming video or some other kind of super intensive content use um and then i basically
[1319.64 --> 1326.68]  tried to bring um the enterprise grade one and then a consumer grade one um to their knees and see
[1326.68 --> 1331.88]  how they held up and the enterprise one is just if it costs three times as much as the consumer grade one
[1331.88 --> 1337.24]  it more than justifies its price in that use case scenario but what they said a lot of people won't have
[1337.24 --> 1343.88]  it in that use case scenario yes so if you had a um like if you had an extremely busy household where lots
[1343.88 --> 1349.00]  of people are running off wireless it could make a lot of sense or it could completely not because you
[1349.00 --> 1354.04]  might be better off getting a lot of more inexpensive consumer grade access points and then positioning
[1354.04 --> 1361.16]  them all over the place so if you want like a blanket of wireless over the entire building that can handle
[1361.16 --> 1367.40]  seemingly unlimited load like this thing is awesome then enterprise grade well the the are we calling it
[1367.40 --> 1374.68]  what what ap we're talking about yeah it's the r700 yeah okay so that exact model ap is what um a mutual
[1374.68 --> 1380.76]  friend of nick and i uses he's an it manager at a school i'm trying to be as vague as possible he uses
[1380.76 --> 1386.84]  r700s all over the place and for the entire school with all these kids hammering it all day they're fine
[1387.40 --> 1392.36]  yeah so like i knew before you started doing this testing i was like the r700 is gonna smash what was it
[1392.36 --> 1398.44]  you were you were you were you were hoping i was i was hoping that the cisco meraki would do better
[1398.44 --> 1407.64]  than the r700 so that i could trade and then because somehow i wasn't going to figure out that the r700
[1407.64 --> 1412.92]  is better than the meraki well i was like if he goes through his raw testing and it like wins in
[1412.92 --> 1418.76]  whatever scenarios he's doing then then wouldn't you be happy with it why did you want the ruckus
[1418.76 --> 1425.80]  is there something you know that i don't about it uh it's a little bit i i like the localized
[1425.80 --> 1431.72]  manageability i don't i don't like the cloud stuff that cisco meraki is doing uh i find it more simple
[1431.72 --> 1438.60]  because i find the cisco meraki interface is designed around someone in a use case more like our mutual
[1438.60 --> 1444.44]  friends where they're running a whole bunch of these ap's i want one all the main menus are like here's your
[1444.44 --> 1448.28]  google map style map plot all the points where your ap's are i'm like i don't have
[1448.28 --> 1455.40]  a campus i have one small basement suite like i don't need this i just want to manage it and like
[1455.40 --> 1460.36]  if you're having some problem or if i'm offline for whatever reason i still want to be able to access
[1460.36 --> 1467.88]  my ap and there was that funny thing where um some of my clients didn't support forcing 2.4 gigahertz
[1467.88 --> 1473.24]  and while every other access point that i was originally going to include in my test one from ubiquity
[1473.24 --> 1480.52]  um a couple from linksys anyway every other one supported splitting out the ss splitting out 2.4
[1480.52 --> 1485.48]  gigahertz and 5 gigahertz into separate ssids so i could manually connect to them separately
[1485.48 --> 1492.44]  the meraki doesn't didn't even support forcing 2.4 gigahertz on an ssid until luke called them
[1492.44 --> 1497.24]  honestly the dude on the phone was like super nice yeah and they were really fast they returned the call
[1497.24 --> 1501.88]  really fast yeah they picked up really quickly they solved the problem really quickly and they're
[1501.88 --> 1510.12]  really nice no not once i don't think so real real dude and like fixed it right away but he had to add
[1510.12 --> 1515.88]  a button to luke's cloud management interface to force 2.4 gigahertz why is this button not in here
[1515.88 --> 1521.32]  already yeah it's cool they're able to add it yeah but i shouldn't have to call support for a basic
[1521.32 --> 1526.76]  feature like that i think part of the reason is that uh that ap that you have isn't like isn't
[1526.76 --> 1532.12]  actually their highest end ap so it's kind of like bridging between enterprise and consumer so i
[1532.12 --> 1536.04]  think they're trying to help people like more like i wouldn't say consumer but like small business yeah
[1536.04 --> 1540.44]  yeah yeah so i think they're trying to help people not screw up considering that option exists i'm sure
[1540.44 --> 1544.52]  on the even higher version it's probably there because they're expecting more of an ip administration
[1545.32 --> 1551.24]  yeah so i don't know if they should lose too many points for that but well a more fair comparison
[1551.32 --> 1556.28]  and where i might be better prepared to uh to do more of this testing like now that i know what
[1556.28 --> 1563.08]  i'm doing i i burned like probably 16 hours of the time i spent prepping that video figuring out a way
[1563.08 --> 1568.60]  to get repeatable results so once i have a bet i have better gear once i have better software once i've
[1568.60 --> 1574.20]  had some more time to tinker with it i might tackle this again and then that would probably be a good time
[1574.20 --> 1580.60]  for when um because we talked to ruckus about their x claim product line yeah so not the r series product
[1580.60 --> 1587.88]  line but that would be probably more comparable to your maraki anyway um where these ones are
[1587.88 --> 1597.08]  managed these are app managed uh wow that is that's a new fan art from jack sack jack sack did more fan
[1597.08 --> 1604.52]  art hold on we gotta show this that's so good that was so fast how does he do it so fast dude it's
[1604.52 --> 1610.36]  awesome i love his art style a wizard i love how you just magically have super long hair
[1612.04 --> 1615.64]  well i think it was supposed to be like a modification of the pc master race guy
[1616.44 --> 1621.64]  i don't think so no i think it's just like the beauty hair thing yeah i think it's just majestic yeah
[1621.64 --> 1631.56]  that's awesome oh this is legitimately pretty cool i know i was like kind of playing around with it
[1632.44 --> 1637.00]  like he's like it's not bad he's very posable yeah fully pose and he actually manages to hold the gun
[1637.72 --> 1642.60]  which is a better than most action figures i got as a kid i don't think this is like these don't get
[1642.60 --> 1646.92]  archived or anything right no yeah okay so this isn't getting archived we're not this isn't a sponsor
[1646.92 --> 1650.84]  spot anymore that was honestly i was not really sold on the creek before and that was actually
[1650.84 --> 1657.08]  pretty cool you get a lot of stuff for 14 bucks a shirt is about what you normally get yeah it's a
[1657.08 --> 1660.84]  pretty cool shirt unless you're luke in which case every one of your shirts is free all my shirts are free
[1662.52 --> 1668.36]  and like i'm not super into the little action figure thing but the bandana was cool yeah um the coin if
[1668.36 --> 1675.64]  that game was good was cool yeah um the uh sorry i already said the bandana the free game that's i like
[1675.64 --> 1680.68]  that they have like a variety of stuff yes so they hit like it's kind of like and like there's
[1680.68 --> 1686.04]  enough value there's enough value in each type of variety that it was probably worth it even if
[1686.04 --> 1689.80]  there's a whole bunch of stuff you don't care i don't know how they do it so cheaply just to be
[1689.80 --> 1695.48]  perfectly honest mass yeah mass ordering yeah even even then like things like t-shirts only go down to
[1695.48 --> 1700.52]  a certain cost like well there's like six dollar t-shirts.com and stuff yeah but that's you just have to
[1700.52 --> 1705.48]  produce enough so that's six dollars so like yeah they only have thirteen dollars but no they sell
[1705.48 --> 1710.28]  it for six dollars i know but it's cheaper so maybe it's four dollars or three dollars but that's
[1710.28 --> 1715.72]  still using up a significant chunk of your budget yeah and it's probably like they do this every month
[1716.04 --> 1723.16]  you can move his forms um they do this every month so they probably just have like some super
[1723.16 --> 1727.00]  crazy contract where it's like yeah we're ordering like 10 000 shirts a month from you so we get blah blah
[1727.00 --> 1731.24]  a lot yeah possibly a lot more than 10 000. i mean i have no idea how much business they do
[1731.24 --> 1737.96]  either i'm pretty sure it's huge though it's significant yeah yeah because i'm sure i'm not
[1737.96 --> 1744.60]  the first person who's been like oh it could be a good idea if i order this myself and then sift through
[1744.60 --> 1748.68]  the stuff and give it to someone else's presence like i'm sure i'm not the first person that's done
[1748.68 --> 1753.08]  that there's got to be some mom that subscribed to it and then uses everything in there as stocking
[1753.08 --> 1757.48]  stuffers for christmas for example yeah people even like get this stuff to like decorate their
[1757.48 --> 1763.48]  offices like when we went to the hyper x office yeah that one person had like so many pop vinyls
[1763.48 --> 1768.12]  yeah on their thing not sure if they got it through loot crate or through funko but like yeah right
[1768.12 --> 1774.04]  and actually this wouldn't be a bad thing for uh for us to have as just set dressing for for sets and
[1774.04 --> 1779.64]  stuff because we we did order some junk from think geek that you know it's amazing how people some people
[1779.64 --> 1784.84]  were upset about that they're like yeah i you know contributed to first blood and you guys
[1784.84 --> 1789.80]  went and spent money on there were some pieces yeah it's like we we need some of that stuff around
[1789.80 --> 1795.40]  here because we can't just have a blank wall like that poster we own like yeah it's not like it's just
[1795.40 --> 1800.28]  like they're here for us to like occasionally we'll have it in the background of something or whatever
[1800.28 --> 1805.24]  else when we need something yeah or we'll like hit linus with it like we throw them at me all the stuff
[1805.24 --> 1814.28]  behind this the horse head we didn't pay for my head's been in there for like hours at this point
[1817.40 --> 1824.28]  i'm just like you can go for it but like that's two halloween's now that's the entire piece you build
[1824.28 --> 1830.36]  that packs based on how much your hands sweat actually my head's not the same his hands sweat
[1830.36 --> 1837.80]  way more than anything you go to the gym like you don't really sweat no much yeah i sweat like
[1837.80 --> 1843.00]  my hands like i think all of the sweat in my entire body just like comes to my hands then it's just like
[1843.00 --> 1847.00]  braw understand how your hands do that no because you're right i don't really when i work out and
[1847.00 --> 1852.44]  stuff like i'm way sweatier in general than you and my hands are not as bad as yours yeah i don't know
[1853.00 --> 1858.12]  someone's asking us to check out arrow hive access points i mean we're i'm not even sure if this is a
[1858.12 --> 1866.20]  category we're gonna continue to be interested in but uh no i don't think we should i don't think i
[1866.20 --> 1871.08]  don't think we should either we're not doing ai o liquid coolers anymore right i don't think so
[1872.52 --> 1879.40]  how big is the radiator cool that's how well it performs it's like yeah i don't know
[1881.56 --> 1887.08]  at least with air coolers there's a lot of more unique shapes and yeah weird things that they'll do it's
[1887.08 --> 1891.40]  like this is good for this system even if the performance is identical to everything else yeah
[1891.40 --> 1896.52]  yeah yeah yeah it's like if you need ram on either side of your cpu socket this might be important
[1896.52 --> 1901.56]  yeah stuff like that and like the only things that i could see as an advantage of like those
[1902.20 --> 1908.60]  rajentech or whatever ones that are coming out is like they look cooler yeah and good good looking air
[1908.60 --> 1914.28]  coolers i'm i'm totally into yeah but like to do an ai liquid cooler review and be like the only thing
[1914.28 --> 1919.24]  that's different is that it looks cool it's just like this is like awesome stuff this guy's like
[1919.24 --> 1924.60]  yeah i got all this stuff from loot crate oh i guess i could just screen share derp in uh in a year
[1924.60 --> 1931.88]  he got that oh my goodness oh wow he got a little viking from skyrim i like i just said like i like
[1931.88 --> 1938.28]  the adventure time the adventure time you got a blue mega man helmet man i'm jelly the adventure time stuff
[1938.28 --> 1943.64]  is fantastic that's really cool i think the big man helmets were randomized yeah they were uh there's
[1943.64 --> 1948.44]  a lot of stuff in there like i got one of their like hey we're getting rid of all the stuff we have
[1948.44 --> 1953.32]  lying around crates one time and i got like the jazz transformer guy there was like a bunch of them
[1953.88 --> 1966.28]  i think it's jazz that's one of them i don't know there's a jazz so not e-jazz a jazz yeah
[1966.28 --> 1967.64]  yeah
[1971.80 --> 1978.76]  all right i think uh burkel needs you to look at something so oh okay peace guys bye everyone
[1978.76 --> 1983.32]  we might go get food i'm gonna stream later okay bye i think that's all i really need to say you can click
[1983.32 --> 1984.44]  the button
