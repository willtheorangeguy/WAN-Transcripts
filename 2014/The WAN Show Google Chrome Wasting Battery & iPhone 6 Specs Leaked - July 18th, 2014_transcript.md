[0.00 --> 4.92]  And we're live and only five minutes late today.
[5.14 --> 6.30]  That's not bad.
[6.30 --> 8.32]  Well, okay, it's not good.
[8.50 --> 9.08]  And we're sorry.
[9.20 --> 12.68]  We apologize very much for being terrible people.
[12.86 --> 13.16]  Not profusely.
[13.20 --> 18.58]  But in our defense, we actually had no audio five minutes ago.
[19.52 --> 21.90]  Or no, I guess it must have been about ten minutes ago.
[21.98 --> 24.96]  Five minutes before Showtime, we had no audio whatsoever.
[25.32 --> 26.88]  And now we're live.
[27.76 --> 28.46]  And it works.
[28.60 --> 29.72]  And everything is working.
[29.72 --> 30.50]  It's amazing.
[31.12 --> 31.48]  Hopefully.
[31.64 --> 33.14]  We're making a lot of assumptions here.
[33.36 --> 34.24]  We are, yes.
[34.78 --> 36.06]  Okay, there's one thing that isn't working.
[36.06 --> 37.40]  I can't even connect to Twitch Chats.
[37.64 --> 39.26]  I can't sign into the dock.
[41.02 --> 42.84]  See, your dock's thought up.
[43.10 --> 45.58]  I can't see if we're actually working because Twitch Chats all bugged me.
[45.60 --> 48.20]  I was in the dock when we filmed the show introduction.
[48.46 --> 49.10]  I know, I know.
[49.50 --> 51.84]  I was in the dock like two minutes ago.
[52.76 --> 54.66]  And the stupid thing is...
[54.66 --> 55.22]  Oh, man.
[57.38 --> 58.70]  I'm not getting the...
[58.70 --> 59.54]  What's the O you're...
[59.54 --> 62.88]  Beautiful.
[62.88 --> 65.76]  Actually, it's been really inconsistent lately.
[65.90 --> 67.86]  And have you noticed they don't give you other options anymore?
[68.20 --> 71.80]  There's no option for send me a text again unless you wait a hundred years.
[71.98 --> 73.82]  And then there's no option to call you with it.
[74.10 --> 77.08]  So it's like, send a text to your backup phone, which is my wife's phone.
[77.44 --> 77.94]  Because...
[77.94 --> 78.86]  It's not going to be super helpful.
[79.00 --> 80.10]  We're talking about a backup.
[80.48 --> 83.94]  Not like, I should need to use this all the time.
[84.06 --> 84.58]  All the time, yeah, yeah.
[84.62 --> 86.56]  And then the other option is use a backup code.
[86.66 --> 88.80]  Why do I want to use my backup codes all the time?
[88.84 --> 89.14]  You know what?
[89.20 --> 91.20]  Two-step service is ungodly, though.
[92.16 --> 93.30]  Ungodly bad or good?
[93.54 --> 93.94]  Good.
[94.26 --> 95.08]  Okay, sure.
[95.16 --> 95.50]  It's VAC.
[96.40 --> 96.72]  Yeah.
[96.72 --> 101.74]  It seems like the email's been received before you actually press the button to send it.
[101.84 --> 102.36]  But it isn't.
[102.48 --> 103.72]  But it feels that way.
[103.94 --> 105.54]  Actually, Hotmail's is pretty good, too.
[105.64 --> 110.50]  Hotmail's saved me from having my account hijacked because it's proactive about it.
[110.62 --> 115.20]  It communicates with you if it thinks there's a problem via your other communication methods.
[115.84 --> 121.38]  And it's like, yo, dog, if you don't think this is okay, then you need to let us know right away.
[121.52 --> 123.28]  Like how credit card companies are supposed to do stuff?
[123.46 --> 124.30]  Yeah, yeah.
[124.30 --> 128.04]  Actually, they don't even call me when I leave the country anymore.
[128.40 --> 132.64]  It used to be like I went and bought something expensive.
[133.46 --> 134.04]  Ring, ring.
[134.36 --> 135.62]  And my credit card wouldn't work.
[135.84 --> 138.06]  I called them up to tell them I was going on a trip once.
[138.20 --> 141.12]  And they're like, why are you telling us?
[141.68 --> 144.88]  And I was like, well, wouldn't you want to know if there's these weird charges from another country?
[145.64 --> 147.10]  They're like, no, it's fine.
[148.00 --> 149.60]  I'm like, um, okay.
[149.60 --> 158.12]  Like if there's local purchases on a card that I have only ever used for online purchases for four years and they're local purchases in like Korea.
[158.30 --> 159.52]  You're not going to think that's weird.
[159.82 --> 161.40]  And they're like, no, it's okay.
[161.56 --> 162.64]  I was like, okay.
[162.94 --> 167.84]  I need to pay more attention to what transactions go through my credit card because you're not.
[167.84 --> 174.16]  Okay, well, you're the only one with the dock up because I just requested two text messages and they haven't come through.
[174.40 --> 178.46]  So let's start with the apparently leaked specs of the iPhone 6.
[178.46 --> 180.62]  No, we're supposed to start with the thing and then do the intro.
[180.76 --> 182.32]  Oh, I thought we already did that for some reason.
[182.54 --> 183.20]  Nope, nope.
[183.28 --> 183.90]  We haven't done that.
[184.00 --> 184.22]  All right.
[184.22 --> 188.62]  Well, callouts that we have are Chrome is wasting power on your computer.
[188.78 --> 191.78]  Mainly notable for people with laptops, but we'll talk about that more later.
[192.18 --> 195.84]  Microsoft has cut 18,000 jobs, including Barnacles.
[197.18 --> 197.96]  Sorry, buddy.
[198.14 --> 203.34]  We tried to get him on the show, but I think he's dealing with other things at this point in time, which makes total sense.
[203.44 --> 204.52]  Yeah, it's got stuff to do.
[204.86 --> 207.16]  ESPN will be broadcasting the Dota 2 tournament.
[207.16 --> 215.18]  They'll be broadcasting it on ESPN3 with a highlight pre-show kind of thing on ESPN2 at like 8.30 of the day before or something.
[215.70 --> 221.54]  And Google Plus is withdrawing its real name required policy right after they made everyone merge their accounts.
[221.72 --> 222.46]  Thanks, guys.
[223.72 --> 225.54]  Yeah, I guess we'll talk about that later too.
[225.82 --> 226.58]  Intro time.
[237.16 --> 252.76]  And of course, we have sponsors.
[253.20 --> 254.92]  Hashtag Linus Squarespace.
[255.48 --> 261.68]  You guys have an opportunity to have a chance to win a free year of Squarespace website-ness.
[261.86 --> 266.60]  So go ahead and tweet to hashtag Linus Squarespace if you have a Squarespace site.
[266.60 --> 270.82]  If you don't have one, of course, you can get 10% off one with the offer code even if you don't win.
[271.10 --> 273.76]  We will be drawing a winner later on in the show.
[274.00 --> 277.70]  Our other sponsor this week is 5-4 Club.
[277.98 --> 279.22]  Yes, they're back.
[279.60 --> 288.70]  They're not totally afraid of sponsoring the WAN show after I completely screwed up the whole sponsor segment thing for them on July the 4th.
[288.94 --> 290.38]  I'm amazed they're back.
[290.58 --> 291.44]  Get it? 4th?
[291.98 --> 292.58]  The 4th?
[292.66 --> 293.76]  5-4 Club?
[293.76 --> 301.04]  You know what's funny about 5-4 Club is I've actually had people ask me, do they have clothing for people who are normal height?
[306.26 --> 306.74]  Ah!
[306.74 --> 315.08]  So this is both, you know, this is either a misunderstanding or you're taking a shot at me for being short.
[315.34 --> 317.24]  Going like, oh, it's Linus.
[317.36 --> 319.20]  He must be endorsing short people clothes.
[319.48 --> 321.06]  And the company's called 5-4.
[321.18 --> 323.32]  I'm like, no, that's not what the 5-4 is for.
[323.86 --> 326.82]  Anyway, all right, let's move on to our first topic.
[327.16 --> 329.16]  Can we tell people what the 5-4 was for on the 4th?
[329.16 --> 332.88]  10-4?
[334.40 --> 335.30]  No? All right.
[335.46 --> 335.86]  Good work.
[337.48 --> 339.30]  Anyways, moving on.
[339.78 --> 342.88]  We have the apparently supposedly leaked specs.
[343.32 --> 343.68]  Supposedly.
[343.86 --> 346.72]  But one thing in it makes me really think that's probably not true.
[346.98 --> 348.58]  Actually, I'm going to disagree with you.
[348.62 --> 352.14]  So this was posted by I Fear Z on the forum, but I'm going to let you go ahead first.
[353.02 --> 354.12]  Oh, I guess screen size.
[354.12 --> 358.54]  Anyways, I'll just run through specs because there's not a lot other than specs, but...
[358.54 --> 359.04]  iPhone Air.
[359.50 --> 360.24]  iPhone Air?
[361.70 --> 362.50]  Oh, whatever.
[362.80 --> 363.50]  It's iPhone 6.
[363.64 --> 364.38]  Whatever it'll be called.
[364.52 --> 364.82]  We'll see what they actually call it.
[364.92 --> 365.04]  Yeah.
[365.50 --> 368.70]  4.7-inch, 1280x800 resolution.
[369.24 --> 371.90]  At 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB capacity.
[372.06 --> 373.18]  Yeah, no 16GB.
[374.22 --> 378.68]  A8 chip with 64-bit architecture and M8 motion coprocessor.
[378.88 --> 382.48]  EyeSight camera with, like, EyeSight camera.
[382.48 --> 385.78]  With 12 megapixels and 4K video recording.
[385.94 --> 387.80]  Fingerprint second-gen identity sensor.
[388.10 --> 388.88]  iOS 8.
[389.42 --> 392.26]  And it'll come in colors of silver, gold, and space gray.
[392.76 --> 394.48]  I don't know why gray needed its own little...
[395.16 --> 396.06]  Well, space gray.
[396.18 --> 400.68]  I mean, it's different from, like, you know, gunmetal gray or battleship gray.
[400.94 --> 402.86]  But then there's different versions of silver and gold.
[402.90 --> 403.62]  Gray's Anatomy.
[405.36 --> 406.56]  50 Shades of Gray.
[407.66 --> 409.64]  Well, 50 Shades of Gray would be 50 different.
[410.06 --> 410.32]  Right.
[410.32 --> 411.70]  So that could include space gray.
[412.48 --> 412.80]  Okay.
[412.98 --> 419.28]  So the point is, I don't know, this looks perfectly right to me, especially if they're going to have a larger version.
[419.82 --> 429.24]  And Marcus's video, as well as the bajillion copycat videos showing off the sapphire glass, it actually kind of drove me crazy in his video.
[429.70 --> 430.78]  I should probably...
[430.78 --> 432.34]  Look, you can see through it.
[432.34 --> 433.98]  No, well, okay.
[433.98 --> 441.20]  That drove me a little bit crazy, too, because he says right in his video that he's never held a piece of gorilla glass.
[441.20 --> 445.32]  And then he's kind of marveling at how amazing the sapphire crystal glass is.
[445.32 --> 449.30]  And I'm kind of like, dude, gorilla glass is, like, actually pretty similar.
[449.30 --> 452.86]  I mean, it's not going to have quite the same degree of scratch resistance.
[452.86 --> 466.30]  But in terms of being really flexible, being very clear, you know, if you hold it in front of your eye and don't hold it in front of your eye, the human eye is not going to be able to differentiate between something like gorilla glass 3 and sapphire crystal glass.
[466.30 --> 468.40]  Just, like, holding them up and trying to look through them.
[468.66 --> 470.32]  You're going to need actual equipment for that.
[470.50 --> 473.18]  But no, the thing that kind of bugged me was he kept calling it a panel.
[474.18 --> 476.66]  And it's not a panel of glass.
[476.90 --> 478.38]  You don't have a panel of glass.
[478.42 --> 482.46]  You have an LCD panel and you have a glass cover over top of it.
[483.22 --> 485.12]  So anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway.
[485.12 --> 494.56]  The whole point is that if iPhone 6 in its 4.7 inch version ends up also having a bigger brother, which Marcus's video,
[494.56 --> 500.04]  which did a great job of just showcasing how amazing that piece of glass is,
[500.32 --> 503.38]  if Marcus's video is true and that's a piece for a bigger one,
[503.64 --> 508.82]  then I think it makes perfect sense that this one is going to be a mere 1280 by 800 resolution display.
[509.14 --> 511.68]  I just jumped into this assuming only one.
[511.68 --> 516.28]  I actually even forgot about the fact that that thing was bigger because they always just release one.
[516.60 --> 519.84]  But Steve Jobs doesn't exist anymore, so maybe they'll release more than one.
[519.84 --> 528.92]  Yeah, and I mean the thing too for me is that at 4.7 inches or even at 5 inches or even at sort of, yeah,
[529.36 --> 536.54]  at almost any size for a phone, I don't actually find 720p to be not enough.
[537.24 --> 543.74]  I don't think it's, I think I can still tell the difference between 720p and 1080p, but it doesn't bother me.
[543.84 --> 544.84]  I mean you're using a Moto X right now.
[544.84 --> 547.68]  But this isn't going to be, that's a pretty small screen.
[547.96 --> 549.12]  What is it? 4.5?
[549.12 --> 550.16]  4.3?
[550.66 --> 551.48]  I can't remember.
[552.24 --> 553.48]  That's a fair amount of difference.
[554.48 --> 555.34]  Oh, that screen size.
[555.40 --> 556.26]  4.7 inch.
[557.30 --> 558.54]  Let's just have a really small bezel.
[558.66 --> 559.32]  So there you go.
[560.58 --> 562.02]  And does it make a difference to you?
[562.08 --> 562.34]  Yeah.
[562.34 --> 568.46]  It's not bad, but I can definitely tell the difference.
[568.80 --> 570.42]  It doesn't look nearly as good as my G2 did.
[571.26 --> 571.56]  Right.
[571.64 --> 573.26]  Like it's fairly, I don't know.
[573.38 --> 575.14]  It makes a noticeable difference for sure.
[575.22 --> 577.20]  The flip side of that, or not the flip side.
[577.20 --> 579.14]  And you're buying a premium cost phone.
[579.14 --> 584.86]  The extension of that is that LG's G3 with its 1440p screen really didn't make that much of a difference to me.
[584.86 --> 586.88]  But that's a different, you can't compare that necessarily.
[586.88 --> 591.38]  Because you're comparing lower resolution difference versus higher resolution difference.
[591.46 --> 591.94]  That's not fair.
[592.30 --> 596.98]  You can't compare the noticeable difference between lower resolutions to the noticeable difference between higher resolutions.
[598.70 --> 599.86]  What are you talking about?
[601.38 --> 608.50]  I'm saying, okay, I'm saying 720p versus 1080p is a noticeable leap, but doesn't make that much of a difference to me.
[608.86 --> 611.24]  Whereas beyond that, it makes no difference to me at all.
[611.44 --> 612.12]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[612.24 --> 613.22]  Okay, that's not how you worded it.
[613.22 --> 617.54]  So, I mean, I don't mind that Apple's not giving us a higher resolution display.
[617.70 --> 618.88]  I understand why they're doing it.
[618.90 --> 622.54]  Because the way that their whole ecosystem works with every app just works.
[622.74 --> 624.16]  Every app looks right on every phone.
[624.26 --> 625.96]  Every time they change something like that.
[625.96 --> 634.14]  I mean, when the iPhone 5 first launched with the taller display, it was disaster town for a long time in terms of app compatibility.
[634.50 --> 635.80]  Everyone had to run out an update.
[635.80 --> 644.16]  So, if they were to all of a sudden be supporting three different resolutions, now it's becoming more like an Android-like experience for the app developers.
[644.32 --> 645.74]  So, I totally get that.
[646.08 --> 648.90]  It's just, I'd like to see 1080p.
[648.98 --> 649.96]  I just don't think it's the end of the world.
[649.96 --> 650.40]  Yeah.
[650.62 --> 652.34]  I think it'll still be pretty sim-
[652.34 --> 658.02]  Okay, not similar, but I think it'll still be a lot easier for people to develop on iPhone than Android.
[658.60 --> 658.70]  Right.
[658.70 --> 665.68]  Just because you have these different resolutions, but at least you don't have all these different devices with crazy different hardware in them.
[665.68 --> 673.04]  Like, I know the Bound-in guys had tons of issue with, like, getting their balancing correct across all devices.
[673.36 --> 673.76]  Right.
[673.98 --> 675.88]  Because you have to move it around, right?
[675.92 --> 676.80]  Because you're moving the phone around.
[677.02 --> 680.08]  So, they'd have certain things where, like, they put it down on the table.
[680.62 --> 681.68]  Yeah, they can't see the table.
[681.92 --> 682.74]  So, they put it down on the table.
[682.74 --> 688.04]  Put it down on the table, and with their default code, it's sitting there still, but it's showing the thing just flying all over the place.
[688.30 --> 688.70]  Right.
[688.96 --> 689.82]  Because it didn't make sense.
[689.90 --> 693.94]  So, they had to write adaptive code to manage all the different devices, which is interesting.
[693.94 --> 699.26]  But with Apple, you'll have much less differences in terms of that.
[699.34 --> 700.50]  But then resolution will be...
[700.50 --> 700.90]  Yeah.
[701.50 --> 702.06]  I don't know.
[702.10 --> 708.06]  Oh, one thing that we missed there, given the rundown of the specs, is they're going to have a Touch ID 2 fingerprint identity sensor.
[708.18 --> 710.22]  So, it looks like they're improving it already.
[710.50 --> 711.50]  Oh, did you cover that?
[711.84 --> 712.28]  Oh, okay.
[712.38 --> 713.68]  I probably just wasn't paying attention.
[714.70 --> 717.42]  The one they have right now, though, is really good, didn't you say?
[717.54 --> 718.82]  Yeah, I really like it.
[718.82 --> 722.06]  I mean, it's not the most secure thing in the world, but it was never expected to be.
[722.16 --> 722.22]  No.
[722.22 --> 726.14]  And it's still going to be more secure than most just, like, tab passwords anyways.
[727.34 --> 727.92]  There we go.
[727.98 --> 728.28]  Oh!
[728.48 --> 729.98]  I forgot something, actually.
[730.18 --> 734.52]  For the 5-4 clothing thing today, we actually have a giveaway.
[734.82 --> 736.74]  And you guys should definitely participate in this.
[737.14 --> 739.66]  So, let me just find it.
[739.88 --> 748.02]  Tweet, tag at 5-4 on Twitter, tag your friend, and use hashtag Linus5-4.
[748.02 --> 748.66]  Okay?
[749.30 --> 755.16]  So, send out that tweet, and whoever that is, U.S. and Canada, by the way, has a chance
[755.16 --> 758.02]  to win a free month worth of clothing.
[758.16 --> 759.22]  So, 120 bucks worth of clothes?
[759.22 --> 759.30]  Your friend has a chance?
[759.50 --> 759.78]  Yes.
[760.08 --> 762.56]  So, basically, you just got to find a buddy and do it to each other?
[762.56 --> 762.74]  No.
[762.86 --> 763.38]  No, no, no, no, no.
[763.42 --> 768.04]  You tag a friend who you think will enjoy 5-4 to enter to win a package of clothes from
[768.04 --> 768.94]  5-4 for yourself.
[768.94 --> 769.02]  So, you enter to win.
[769.18 --> 769.42]  Yeah.
[769.58 --> 769.74]  Yeah.
[769.88 --> 770.04]  Okay.
[770.44 --> 770.62]  Yeah.
[770.84 --> 770.96]  Cool.
[770.96 --> 772.94]  We should ask them if they can send clothes to your buddy, too.
[772.98 --> 773.60]  That'd be pretty cool.
[773.72 --> 774.52]  That would be pretty cool.
[774.70 --> 775.02]  You know what?
[775.08 --> 780.54]  I'm just going to preemptively be like, yes, you and your buddy both win it, and now there's
[780.54 --> 781.36]  nothing they can do.
[781.56 --> 782.68]  They're just going to hate me.
[782.72 --> 783.76]  They are going to hate you.
[784.82 --> 789.00]  Like, falsified information on all of the sponsor in a package.
[789.72 --> 790.78]  It's not false.
[790.88 --> 791.86]  It's just not true.
[792.08 --> 793.38]  But I will make it true.
[794.46 --> 795.46]  Therefore, it's true.
[795.84 --> 797.12]  I guess, yeah.
[797.12 --> 800.48]  If they refuse to do it, I will buy you a month worth of 5-4.
[800.58 --> 801.16]  So, there you go.
[801.28 --> 801.48]  All right?
[801.48 --> 801.84]  Okay, then.
[802.16 --> 804.10]  This is why we don't have air conditioning in the office.
[804.52 --> 807.40]  Because I'm too busy buying 5-4 clothing for people.
[808.84 --> 809.32]  Yeah.
[809.80 --> 810.36]  All right.
[810.36 --> 819.12]  So, let's go ahead and move on to actually a really amazing little piece of article-ness
[819.12 --> 820.30]  over on Forbes here.
[820.44 --> 823.06]  So, here's the original article written by Ian Morris.
[823.80 --> 828.44]  Google's Chrome web browser, and this is a very sensationalist title, Ian.
[829.00 --> 832.56]  Google's Chrome web browser is killing your laptop battery.
[832.56 --> 834.88]  He needed to...
[834.88 --> 836.16]  Just, there were a couple things.
[836.30 --> 841.20]  There were a couple things Ian over here needed to do to make this not sensationalist.
[841.28 --> 843.30]  So, could have put life at the end.
[843.78 --> 845.90]  Killing your laptop's battery life.
[846.28 --> 848.26]  Or not use the word killing.
[848.56 --> 850.16]  So, is...
[850.16 --> 850.60]  No.
[850.88 --> 851.48]  Just, yeah.
[851.96 --> 852.40]  Life.
[852.54 --> 853.12]  Battery life.
[853.28 --> 854.10]  It's not killing the battery.
[854.10 --> 854.34]  Okay.
[854.74 --> 857.98]  You could make the argument that it is killing the battery, because the battery does have
[857.98 --> 859.92]  a finite number of charge and discharge cycles.
[860.50 --> 862.46]  But it's not the primary concern here.
[862.98 --> 864.88]  So, what's going on?
[864.98 --> 867.06]  Why does your laptop battery...
[867.06 --> 871.58]  And it's not just running Chrome and doing things in Chrome.
[871.94 --> 874.54]  Having Chrome open is enough.
[874.70 --> 876.12]  Do you want to run through the details here?
[876.56 --> 879.56]  Which, if you're a Chrome user, you're going to have Chrome open all the time.
[879.60 --> 883.38]  Especially because Google wants you using Chrome as, like...
[883.38 --> 885.70]  A desktop application replacement.
[885.94 --> 886.36]  Yeah.
[887.02 --> 888.06]  In a lot of different places.
[888.12 --> 889.20]  In a lot of different places.
[889.20 --> 892.48]  So, like, they're going to try to make you keep it open all the time.
[892.54 --> 893.68]  Which I'd really rather not.
[893.90 --> 894.94]  But either way.
[895.16 --> 895.38]  Alright.
[895.38 --> 897.48]  So, how this works is your...
[897.48 --> 897.76]  Where is it?
[897.78 --> 899.04]  System clock tick rate.
[899.20 --> 902.14]  Which is normally set at about 64 times per second.
[902.28 --> 905.08]  Is being ramped up to 1,000 times per second.
[905.16 --> 907.90]  So, your processor tries to go to sleep in these little intervals.
[908.08 --> 909.94]  So, that you save power when it's not doing things.
[910.64 --> 914.48]  So, with most web browsers, if you're doing something heavy, like watching a YouTube video,
[914.66 --> 915.52]  it will do this.
[916.26 --> 918.94]  But when you stop watching a YouTube video, it will stop.
[918.94 --> 922.22]  And it will go back to 64 ticks instead of 1,000 ticks.
[923.02 --> 923.38]  But Chrome...
[923.38 --> 924.54]  Did you explain what a tick is?
[924.80 --> 925.46]  I just did.
[926.50 --> 926.74]  Not that kind of tick.
[926.74 --> 927.28]  Would you be a little better?
[927.86 --> 929.26]  I think I did it pretty well.
[929.52 --> 930.04]  Oh, okay.
[930.58 --> 933.40]  I'd say that your processor goes to sleep in between these ticks.
[933.66 --> 934.16]  Okay, sure.
[934.26 --> 934.66]  But what...
[934.66 --> 935.50]  In between ticks.
[935.62 --> 936.98]  But what is the tick then?
[937.64 --> 938.48]  It's like...
[938.48 --> 939.96]  It's a timing system.
[940.26 --> 943.32]  Programs can use it so they keep up to date and keep up to speed.
[943.44 --> 943.72]  There we go.
[943.72 --> 944.24]  Get to processing.
[944.38 --> 947.28]  So, the tick rate is how often it's checking, basically.
[947.54 --> 948.28]  Yeah, I said...
[948.28 --> 948.54]  Okay.
[948.94 --> 949.70]  Fine, whatever.
[949.84 --> 950.84]  Your explanation was great.
[951.04 --> 951.36]  Here you go.
[951.56 --> 951.94]  No.
[952.96 --> 953.72]  Not at all.
[953.92 --> 954.16]  Okay.
[955.52 --> 956.74]  Anyways, continuing forward.
[956.86 --> 961.64]  This can effectively, apparently, cause your laptop's batteries to die 25% faster.
[961.64 --> 968.26]  And I don't remember where the note is, but it's somewhere in his chart here.
[968.26 --> 973.76]  On a desktop, it can go from about 12 to 15 watts to, I think it was 20 watts.
[973.92 --> 974.60]  At idle.
[974.60 --> 975.04]  At idle.
[975.04 --> 978.22]  Anywhere from 15 to 20 watts of power consumption at idle.
[978.30 --> 979.12]  Not doing anything.
[979.52 --> 982.46]  Just having the Chrome browser open on the screen.
[982.46 --> 985.88]  So, 15 to 20 watts with Chrome, 12 to 15 watts with nothing else.
[986.62 --> 986.96]  So...
[986.96 --> 987.88]  Wow.
[987.88 --> 988.96]  Kind of brutal.
[988.96 --> 992.68]  I mean, I guess that performance has got to come from somewhere.
[992.68 --> 998.50]  I mean, there's the, you know those commercials they have where they have like the machine that fires thing.
[998.74 --> 999.44]  The potato thing?
[999.54 --> 999.68]  Yeah.
[999.68 --> 1000.46]  That's actually pretty cool.
[1000.46 --> 1001.34]  It is really cool.
[1001.42 --> 1003.48]  And I'm glad that Chrome is faster than that.
[1003.54 --> 1009.46]  But I wish that, I wish that they didn't have to make my battery life not go for as long.
[1009.80 --> 1009.98]  Yeah.
[1009.98 --> 1011.32]  Um, in order to achieve it.
[1011.44 --> 1014.52]  I wish if one of the requirements was that it was at least your focus window.
[1015.46 --> 1015.86]  Yeah.
[1016.06 --> 1018.24]  Like if it's what you were clicked on at that point in time.
[1018.56 --> 1019.64]  I can kind of get that.
[1019.78 --> 1020.42]  That would make sense.
[1020.54 --> 1022.12]  That would maybe help a little bit.
[1022.28 --> 1027.78]  But like if it's in the background and maybe you're not watching YouTube videos, which are doing it in all other browsers anyways,
[1027.98 --> 1030.12]  it would be nice if it kind of slowed down a little bit.
[1030.80 --> 1040.38]  Because I don't really need my processor being, uh, my web browser able to very effectively play those super annoying video ads that are on places like Tweet Town and a few other websites.
[1040.62 --> 1042.28]  That's super crazy annoying.
[1042.52 --> 1044.20]  It's so annoying.
[1044.34 --> 1045.22]  Oh my God.
[1045.46 --> 1051.24]  Every single time I see an article from them, I'm like, okay, I got to do this one as fast as possible so I can close this damn website.
[1051.90 --> 1052.86]  And anyways.
[1055.10 --> 1058.68]  Anyway, Google has acknowledged the issue and they're working on a fix for it.
[1058.68 --> 1060.68]  Um, it has been acknowledged internally.
[1060.84 --> 1062.16]  Like they're, they're looking at it.
[1062.24 --> 1063.52]  They've acknowledged it as a bug.
[1063.82 --> 1066.20]  It's on the, it's been assigned.
[1066.60 --> 1076.08]  So apparently the only annoying part of that is that they've known about this for an extremely long time and it's been being reported for an extremely long time.
[1076.08 --> 1079.38]  And then like the Forbes and a couple other people are like, hello.
[1079.88 --> 1081.70]  And then they're finally like, oh yeah, okay, we'll do it.
[1082.02 --> 1083.98]  But no timeline has been given for the fix.
[1084.10 --> 1084.24]  No.
[1084.74 --> 1087.88]  So they haven't been working on it yet, I suppose.
[1088.12 --> 1088.82]  No, not at all.
[1089.26 --> 1093.18]  They're probably, it's probably at like buried at the bottom of some overworked programmers queue.
[1093.72 --> 1096.42]  It's just like, okay, I'll do it at some point.
[1096.42 --> 1098.48]  Maybe, who knows.
[1099.14 --> 1102.62]  So we do this from time to time.
[1102.74 --> 1118.38]  We always kind of have this debate, but this is an amazing piece of news for pro gaming and any hope that it has of becoming an acceptable mainstream thing.
[1118.38 --> 1123.08]  The International 2 will be on ESPN.
[1124.54 --> 1125.58]  Did I say 2?
[1125.78 --> 1126.18]  I meant 4.
[1127.06 --> 1128.96]  The International Tournament 4.
[1129.08 --> 1130.80]  So this is the fourth International Tournament.
[1130.92 --> 1130.94]  Dota 2.
[1130.94 --> 1131.96]  Dota 2 Tournament, yes.
[1132.68 --> 1135.42]  Will be broadcast on ESPN.
[1135.62 --> 1139.04]  So there's going to be a couple of different, there's going to be a couple of different streams.
[1139.16 --> 1144.86]  So it's going to be featured on their digital channel, ESPN 3, with a preview of Monday's final.
[1144.86 --> 1153.42]  This will be an ESPN exclusive preview of Monday's final on ESPN 2 at 8.30 p.m. Pacific time on the preceding Sunday.
[1153.66 --> 1156.20]  They are going to have Gabe Newell on.
[1156.50 --> 1158.86]  They are going to be like giving it the actual treatment.
[1159.00 --> 1163.88]  We're talking the streams have got like live action, you know, instant replay.
[1164.32 --> 1169.12]  Something that I'm not entirely sure makes a ton of sense for a MOBA.
[1169.92 --> 1170.60]  It kind of does.
[1170.72 --> 1171.40]  You just don't play them.
[1171.76 --> 1172.66]  Well, okay.
[1172.66 --> 1178.98]  Hold on a second though, because I mean, okay, do you need an instant replay of an attack being executed?
[1179.12 --> 1184.94]  Unless it's something that's particularly exciting, like, oh my god, he almost made it, but he didn't quite.
[1184.96 --> 1185.92]  I think that's more the point.
[1186.04 --> 1189.56]  And like if someone is, say there's an attack that's like a skill shot.
[1189.68 --> 1191.76]  So it's a free flying thing that has to collide.
[1192.04 --> 1192.28]  Yes.
[1192.34 --> 1198.22]  If someone shoots that and then someone uses an evasion thing and like just jumps over it, that could be something cool to show.
[1198.22 --> 1198.38]  Okay.
[1198.62 --> 1199.82]  Or if someone just nicks it.
[1199.86 --> 1201.60]  I think it's going to be a lot of skill shot based stuff.
[1201.74 --> 1207.60]  Or if someone hits spectacularly hard, some crazy critical and just crushes someone, they could show that because it would look cool.
[1208.32 --> 1208.72]  I don't know.
[1208.82 --> 1210.22]  It would look cool to...
[1210.22 --> 1212.40]  Game changing parts of team battles.
[1212.72 --> 1213.04]  Yeah.
[1213.04 --> 1217.96]  Like if something kind of happens, but they want to show you the whole team battle, then they can snap back and be like, this was very important.
[1218.10 --> 1220.82]  This is where the tide turned, blah, blah, blah, for analysis and whatnot.
[1221.20 --> 1224.00]  I guess that's more like during a commercial break thing.
[1224.34 --> 1226.36]  And that's what I was seeing as kind of the issue.
[1226.44 --> 1230.04]  Because you won't be able to show that very effectively with an instant replay.
[1230.50 --> 1231.38]  Not really.
[1231.86 --> 1236.56]  Because you're going to want to kind of draw the X's and O's and kind of go, okay, yeah, here's what went down.
[1236.70 --> 1237.64]  Pause it for a second.
[1237.94 --> 1238.66]  Here's what went down.
[1238.78 --> 1240.32]  That's more of an analysis thing.
[1240.38 --> 1242.04]  That's not an instant replay thing.
[1242.04 --> 1243.30]  Instead replay.
[1243.40 --> 1243.92]  Here's the battle.
[1244.00 --> 1244.66]  A couple people died.
[1244.74 --> 1246.92]  It's like, yeah, I was watching that a little bit slower, but hold on a second.
[1246.98 --> 1247.50]  I didn't follow.
[1247.92 --> 1252.38]  Because the thing about a sports broadcast is think about who it's catering to.
[1252.76 --> 1259.46]  The hardcore guys who really get League of Legends or Dota 2 or these MOBA type games.
[1259.52 --> 1260.90]  These guys are already watching on Twitch.
[1261.08 --> 1261.88]  They're already aware of this.
[1262.10 --> 1270.68]  If the objective of broadcasting on ESPN, which it damn well is, is to appeal to a more mainstream audience, there's going to be no benefit to that.
[1270.68 --> 1273.58]  They're going to look at that and go, hold on a second.
[1273.84 --> 1276.60]  I think it would be a benefit to that if they were a lot further down the line.
[1277.18 --> 1279.00]  Like if this was already mainstream, like football.
[1279.48 --> 1279.70]  Yeah.
[1279.76 --> 1280.84]  Because they do that in football.
[1280.90 --> 1281.46]  It makes more sense.
[1281.48 --> 1281.66]  Yes.
[1281.66 --> 1285.68]  But then they're not worried about what you're talking about, which they should be worried about.
[1285.72 --> 1286.14]  And you're right.
[1287.48 --> 1288.10]  That's interesting.
[1288.10 --> 1291.38]  So I would see it being more like I was talking about, the skill shot stuff.
[1291.50 --> 1291.62]  Yep.
[1291.76 --> 1295.02]  The exciting, this was close, this barely missed.
[1295.28 --> 1299.60]  Like you can do it really slow and watch the skill shot missed by like a pixel or something.
[1299.74 --> 1300.38]  Like that would be cool.
[1300.82 --> 1304.96]  I mean, is that actually, okay, here, I'm going to reveal a little bit of my ignorance here.
[1304.96 --> 1313.22]  In instant replays of a game like Dota 2, do you have alternate camera angles that you can control as a broadcaster?
[1313.56 --> 1315.10]  If we were talking about League, I would know.
[1316.12 --> 1317.16]  That's another thing.
[1317.28 --> 1317.90]  They're there.
[1318.08 --> 1319.32]  Yeah, hit us in the Twitch chat.
[1319.84 --> 1322.62]  I'm pretty freaking sure it has spectator ability.
[1323.18 --> 1326.74]  So their casters would be able to have the spectator camera, which they could control.
[1326.74 --> 1331.76]  That's what I find exciting about an instant replay is you kind of like you.
[1331.94 --> 1334.12]  Okay, let's take hockey, for example, because I'm Canadian.
[1334.28 --> 1336.38]  It's probably the only sport I watch actually.
[1336.84 --> 1336.98]  Yeah.
[1337.04 --> 1343.96]  So hockey, for example, you saw the slap shot from the point and it's in the back of the net and you're just like, okay.
[1344.60 --> 1350.02]  But then the instant replay shows you what actually happened to make that happen.
[1350.10 --> 1354.78]  So maybe there was a tip where someone kind of slid in front of the goal.
[1354.98 --> 1355.52]  Camera's free.
[1355.74 --> 1356.34]  Camera's free.
[1356.34 --> 1356.66]  Okay.
[1356.76 --> 1358.04]  So that makes a ton more sense.
[1358.12 --> 1360.66]  It's just going to depend on how well they can execute it.
[1360.70 --> 1367.70]  And right now there's a little bit of, okay, it's not quite perfect because they have the streams that are designed for the more experienced viewers.
[1367.96 --> 1376.26]  And then they actually have what are supposed to be more noob accessible streams that are supposed to sort of take away from the,
[1376.38 --> 1380.74]  or not use as much of the terminology that a casual observer might not understand.
[1380.94 --> 1382.60]  But right now it's a bit of a mixed bag.
[1382.60 --> 1389.32]  So there's talk of, you know, ganking when my mother's not going to understand what ganking is.
[1389.46 --> 1395.00]  But then the flip side is they're dumbing it down a little bit too much sometimes explaining what the green bar above the character means.
[1395.00 --> 1396.90]  Which, but you know what?
[1396.96 --> 1397.78]  The funny thing is, what are they...
[1397.78 --> 1399.08]  Honestly, they should probably do that.
[1399.14 --> 1400.74]  But then they should also explain what ganking is.
[1401.00 --> 1401.14]  Yeah.
[1401.14 --> 1402.18]  It should be super baseline.
[1402.30 --> 1403.46]  They should explain what everything is.
[1403.46 --> 1408.24]  But the problem is that where are you going to find a basic Dota 2 caster?
[1408.24 --> 1409.42]  Yeah.
[1409.76 --> 1410.04]  Yeah.
[1410.86 --> 1411.08]  Yeah.
[1411.08 --> 1419.84]  Because those guys are not going to be accustomed to casting the game as if someone who doesn't understand what's going on is watching.
[1419.84 --> 1421.64]  But they should try and find, like, coaches.
[1422.28 --> 1422.88]  There's coaches.
[1423.52 --> 1426.68]  So they should try and find coaches that will stream it.
[1426.70 --> 1429.22]  Because it's not as important about being, like, the hype guy.
[1429.34 --> 1432.22]  Because oftentimes there's the technical guy and the hype guy.
[1432.40 --> 1433.68]  If you're doing a two caster setup.
[1433.68 --> 1439.22]  If you're doing a three caster setup, a lot of times it's the technical guy, the hype guy, and then the guy that's mainly just controlling the camera.
[1440.08 --> 1442.16]  Because if you want to make it super cool, you have someone control the camera.
[1442.24 --> 1446.36]  What I'm hoping is that they have, like, a small army of people that are all controlling separate cameras.
[1446.62 --> 1449.42]  So they can get those really cool instant replays that, like you were talking about.
[1452.52 --> 1453.38]  But, yeah.
[1453.54 --> 1456.94]  Like, on an educational stream, you wouldn't need the hype guy, really.
[1458.14 --> 1460.66]  Just have two coaches that can be like,
[1460.70 --> 1462.34]  Oh, well, this is what they were thinking here.
[1462.34 --> 1465.54]  And this is why they thought that these characters can do these different things.
[1465.60 --> 1467.16]  So this is why they're using them in these different ways.
[1467.24 --> 1471.22]  By the way, when he hits Wooten with that giant spell, his green bar goes down.
[1471.36 --> 1472.34]  That represents his HP.
[1472.66 --> 1474.00]  And when he casts that spell, his blue bar goes down.
[1474.00 --> 1475.24]  Yeah, but you can't even say HP.
[1475.60 --> 1475.80]  See?
[1476.14 --> 1477.44]  As gamers, we catch our...
[1477.44 --> 1478.06]  I'm not a coach.
[1478.46 --> 1478.96]  Yeah, fair enough.
[1479.04 --> 1479.20]  Yeah.
[1479.48 --> 1481.50]  Alright, so guys, I have a straw poll for you.
[1481.88 --> 1483.00]  Because in...
[1483.00 --> 1485.08]  Okay, in...
[1485.08 --> 1488.40]  Outside of North America, this kind of thing wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[1488.60 --> 1490.64]  A televised game tournament is like, yeah, okay.
[1490.64 --> 1496.22]  Whereas here, this is a huge, huge deal.
[1496.64 --> 1497.66]  Like, huge deal.
[1497.80 --> 1499.54]  This kind of thing doesn't happen over here.
[1499.76 --> 1502.74]  So I'm posting a straw poll in the Twitch chat.
[1502.80 --> 1503.90]  If I could get the thing to load.
[1504.02 --> 1504.50]  There we go.
[1505.42 --> 1506.18]  Here we go.
[1506.26 --> 1506.78]  Straw poll.
[1507.06 --> 1509.20]  Guys, need to know what you think.
[1509.46 --> 1515.58]  Does a televised North American broadcast of a top-tier gaming tournament like this...
[1515.58 --> 1521.40]  I mean, we're talking over $10 million of prize money with the compendium and Valve's contribution.
[1521.86 --> 1525.30]  Does this validate gaming as a mainstream...
[1525.30 --> 1526.92]  And let's not use the word sport.
[1527.08 --> 1527.98]  Let's say competition.
[1528.16 --> 1531.74]  Because I think there's a lot of people who kind of get hung up on the word sport.
[1531.84 --> 1533.64]  Personally, I get hung up on the word sport.
[1534.08 --> 1534.90]  It's not a sport.
[1534.90 --> 1536.24]  We can call it an e-sport.
[1536.40 --> 1537.80]  We can call it a competition.
[1538.02 --> 1539.48]  We can call it a whatever else.
[1539.64 --> 1541.00]  We can't really call it a sport.
[1541.86 --> 1543.88]  At least, opinion.
[1544.50 --> 1548.54]  So guys, I'd love for you guys to hit us up on this straw poll.
[1548.62 --> 1549.66]  And I want to see what you think.
[1549.88 --> 1553.58]  In the meantime, we'll move on to the next topic while you guys weigh in on this.
[1553.58 --> 1555.66]  But, you know, I don't know.
[1555.74 --> 1564.46]  It's funny because as much as TV, like broadcast television, is a dying medium as opposed to a growing medium.
[1564.64 --> 1566.48]  Or at least not an explosively growing medium.
[1566.70 --> 1568.16]  But it's a dying medium that's huge.
[1568.24 --> 1568.60]  Yes.
[1569.24 --> 1571.00]  It's got a long tail on it.
[1571.08 --> 1573.64]  It's going to be a long time before it's completely irrelevant.
[1573.82 --> 1575.22]  And you know what's funny about it?
[1575.22 --> 1583.30]  Is even though, you know, I look at something like YouTube, my primary distribution platform.
[1583.60 --> 1589.86]  Or I look at something like broadcast television and I go, okay, if someone casted me in a TV commercial,
[1590.24 --> 1597.94]  the actual reach of that, the impact that that has on my personal notoriety, not a whole lot.
[1597.94 --> 1599.94]  In terms of actual eyeballs looking at it.
[1599.94 --> 1607.26]  But for some reason, they've done such a good job over the years of being the prestigious thing compared to web.
[1607.56 --> 1609.20]  And it's going to be a long time before that shifts.
[1609.32 --> 1614.96]  Even I still view TV as a bigger deal than being a big deal on YouTube.
[1615.12 --> 1616.90]  When you're on YouTube, you're internet famous.
[1617.30 --> 1617.38]  Yeah.
[1617.38 --> 1628.18]  And the implication, like the tongue-in-cheek internet famous term comes from the lack of respect we have for people who are internet famous compared to people who are real famous.
[1628.18 --> 1631.86]  Because there's internet and then there's TV and then there's silver screen.
[1632.16 --> 1633.96]  And it's going to be that way for a long time.
[1638.88 --> 1645.50]  Apparently, Josh from Fractal is trying to buy air conditioning units for the office.
[1646.24 --> 1648.16]  People have been spamming me to check my DMs.
[1648.16 --> 1652.68]  Not realizing that I'm still going to have to pay for the electricity, which is not happening.
[1652.68 --> 1655.02]  So he can buy the AC units.
[1655.20 --> 1655.60]  Wow.
[1655.60 --> 1658.70]  But they're going to go wherever it is that they go.
[1659.88 --> 1660.44]  Wow.
[1660.66 --> 1663.04]  If we do AC here, it'll be central AC.
[1663.18 --> 1664.70]  Not those stupid window mounting units.
[1664.70 --> 1669.14]  We'll even pay for the electricity for a paid-for AC unit.
[1669.46 --> 1669.84]  All right.
[1669.94 --> 1670.94]  My boss.
[1671.20 --> 1673.04]  So here you go.
[1673.10 --> 1675.12]  Here's what you guys said about the straw poll.
[1675.12 --> 1679.20]  I'll give you guys one more chance to weigh in right now.
[1679.30 --> 1682.12]  Let's just fire up this guy right here.
[1682.94 --> 1685.50]  People are asking me if I'm going to hire Barnacles.
[1685.70 --> 1687.60]  What makes people think I can afford Barnacles?
[1687.96 --> 1690.32]  What makes people think Barnacles lives here?
[1690.40 --> 1693.64]  What makes people think Barnacles wants to move himself and his family?
[1695.82 --> 1699.20]  There's been a lot of Twitter chatter about when I'm going to hire Barnacles.
[1699.38 --> 1700.60]  I'm not going to hire Barnacles.
[1700.60 --> 1705.04]  He's got his own YouTube channel that's actually growing at a reasonable rate.
[1705.14 --> 1706.70]  He's got his own things to do.
[1707.16 --> 1707.46]  Anyway.
[1707.98 --> 1711.04]  Does a North American TV broadcast mean gaming is going mainstream?
[1711.30 --> 1714.34]  We've got 60% of you saying yes, but not for a while.
[1714.54 --> 1716.72]  20% of you saying yes now.
[1716.94 --> 1719.74]  And the final 20% of you saying no, that's ridiculous.
[1720.28 --> 1720.94]  You know what?
[1722.64 --> 1725.68]  I would have said no, that's ridiculous a year ago.
[1726.74 --> 1729.54]  I'm going to agree with the 62%, 61%.
[1729.54 --> 1730.78]  Yeah, I'm going to go with those guys.
[1730.90 --> 1732.66]  I don't think this is...
[1732.66 --> 1737.54]  I think once all the major matches are cast on ESPN2...
[1738.54 --> 1742.30]  And, I mean, you've got to look at it like any sport.
[1742.54 --> 1747.66]  The acceptance is going to come down to stuff that goes way beyond being broadcast on TV.
[1748.02 --> 1751.10]  The NHL is broadcast on TV in the United States.
[1751.10 --> 1764.34]  That doesn't change the fact that outside of maybe a dozen to a couple dozen areas, that doesn't mean that the NHL really has any penetration compared to how widely accepted and how widely viewed it is in Canada.
[1764.60 --> 1764.76]  Yeah.
[1764.76 --> 1765.76]  So...
[1765.76 --> 1773.48]  Watching the water usage statistics for the Olympic Games is hilarious during hockey matches.
[1773.64 --> 1773.90]  Yeah.
[1774.00 --> 1774.76]  It was the...
[1774.76 --> 1784.72]  It was, I think, the gold medal Canada game or something like that where basically nobody used the bathroom in the entire country while the game was on.
[1784.72 --> 1789.58]  And then the water pressure of the entire country got destroyed.
[1789.76 --> 1792.14]  And as it went into overtime or something...
[1792.14 --> 1793.64]  I forget what game this was exactly.
[1793.74 --> 1794.98]  I think it was an Olympic game.
[1795.32 --> 1798.80]  But as it went into overtime, it got worse and worse.
[1798.86 --> 1800.90]  Because people would be kind of holding out, holding out.
[1800.96 --> 1802.14]  No, I really need to go.
[1802.20 --> 1803.46]  And then they'd wait for an overtime period.
[1804.82 --> 1805.66]  Oh, hilarious.
[1805.66 --> 1807.68]  All right.
[1808.08 --> 1809.60]  ESPN to cast Dota 2 tournament.
[1809.72 --> 1811.10]  That's extremely exciting, though.
[1811.14 --> 1812.10]  I mean, it's a turning point.
[1812.28 --> 1812.54]  It is.
[1812.54 --> 1813.14]  I think it's...
[1813.14 --> 1813.36]  If nothing else.
[1813.40 --> 1814.68]  It's a slightly...
[1814.68 --> 1815.34]  Like, it's not...
[1815.34 --> 1816.18]  I don't think it's enough.
[1816.44 --> 1822.42]  Because saying ESPN is casting it, I think, is almost a little bit sensationalist.
[1822.42 --> 1823.84]  Just because it's ESPN 3.
[1824.24 --> 1824.64]  Yeah.
[1824.90 --> 1825.20]  It's...
[1825.20 --> 1825.48]  It's...
[1825.48 --> 1826.46]  Well, hold on.
[1826.50 --> 1828.36]  They have that pregame coverage on ESPN 2.
[1828.52 --> 1830.90]  That's the important part, though, is the pregame coverage.
[1830.90 --> 1832.80]  And that's why I was saying once it's, like...
[1832.80 --> 1833.60]  Once it's...
[1833.60 --> 1838.88]  Once that pregame coverage is all the major matches, and once it's not the pregame, once
[1838.88 --> 1842.92]  it's the final, once it's, like, that kind of stuff, I think that's more important.
[1843.84 --> 1845.68]  But this is still extremely cool.
[1846.00 --> 1847.22]  I just think it's...
[1847.22 --> 1851.52]  It's, like, the first stone in the, like, walk that we need to create, and it's not even
[1851.52 --> 1852.30]  that big of one.
[1852.62 --> 1852.90]  Right.
[1853.82 --> 1855.68]  It's just very cool that it's actually there.
[1855.92 --> 1858.54]  So this is a post from Builder on the forum.
[1858.54 --> 1862.52]  Google Plus now lets you use any name you want.
[1863.92 --> 1864.32]  Okay.
[1864.84 --> 1866.52]  Thank you, Google.
[1866.88 --> 1867.94]  I still wish...
[1867.94 --> 1868.26]  A little late.
[1868.80 --> 1869.16]  Yeah.
[1869.38 --> 1871.68]  It's a little late, and it's a little frustrating.
[1871.90 --> 1874.54]  I've already created, you know, my...
[1875.36 --> 1880.64]  Using a page for Linus Tech Tips, as opposed to just having a normal person account.
[1881.72 --> 1882.76]  I've already...
[1882.76 --> 1884.00]  Like, I've already done all this stuff.
[1884.00 --> 1891.34]  I've already gone through all this stress of every time I merge any Google service, or
[1891.34 --> 1897.62]  create any new one, or rename anything, worrying about, oh my god, is it permanent now?
[1898.74 --> 1904.24]  Oh my god, do I have to completely junk this YouTube account?
[1904.24 --> 1910.30]  Because instead of Tech Quickie with two capitals, I forgot to make the second queue a capital,
[1910.64 --> 1913.46]  and I cannot change that, because thank you, Google.
[1914.22 --> 1917.94]  So, to me, it's just too little too late.
[1918.00 --> 1923.92]  It's got 4,300 pluses on the post that's shared on Google Plus, of course.
[1923.92 --> 1929.56]  And one thing that I thought was really cool about it is that their development lead is
[1929.56 --> 1935.78]  actually in the Google Plus comments, check this out, replying to individual people's concerns
[1935.78 --> 1940.24]  about the change, because the reality of it is, not everyone's happy about it.
[1940.90 --> 1947.86]  Some people liked the real name policy on Google Plus, and were users of Google Plus, because
[1947.86 --> 1951.92]  they felt like the real name policy took some of the trolling out of it.
[1951.92 --> 1954.78]  I don't know.
[1954.86 --> 1956.06]  Is there anything else to really say about it?
[1956.48 --> 1962.90]  He said specifically at one point, where some people are saying it's come out in playtime
[1962.90 --> 1967.40]  for trolls, but he said one of the reasons it is safe to do at this launch is their troll
[1967.40 --> 1969.72]  smashing department has gotten very good at their jobs.
[1970.24 --> 1973.66]  Which is, that's cool and all, but I don't necessarily...
[1973.66 --> 1974.18]  What are you doing?
[1974.62 --> 1975.18]  Don't worry about it.
[1975.44 --> 1975.72]  Carry on.
[1975.80 --> 1976.14]  Okay.
[1977.60 --> 1980.26]  That's cool and all, but I don't necessarily know if that'll help.
[1980.26 --> 1983.46]  I'm sure there will be, what was it, Bob and his tank or whatever.
[1984.00 --> 1985.34]  I'm sure they will come back.
[1985.70 --> 1987.10]  But I don't even know if I care.
[1987.22 --> 1990.78]  I would much rather have, personally at least, much rather be able to have an account which
[1990.78 --> 1991.78]  doesn't have my name on it.
[1991.80 --> 1994.10]  I never had an account that had my name on it.
[1994.50 --> 1994.60]  Right.
[1995.16 --> 1999.74]  Once they were trying to force you to merge your accounts, I just stopped using my personal
[1999.74 --> 2001.68]  account on YouTube and started using my work one.
[2001.96 --> 2002.10]  Right.
[2002.20 --> 2004.42]  So I didn't have to merge them, so I could keep them separate.
[2004.54 --> 2006.52]  And now I might merge my old personal account.
[2006.78 --> 2007.04]  Right.
[2007.04 --> 2008.76]  Just because, like, that's stupid.
[2008.86 --> 2009.68]  I don't want to do that.
[2009.76 --> 2013.90]  For me, it's frustrating because I don't go by my real name, really.
[2014.16 --> 2018.70]  Like, Austin Evans goes by his real name across the board on the YouTube channel, on Twitter,
[2019.12 --> 2019.44]  everywhere.
[2019.96 --> 2022.30]  Whereas, I don't go by that.
[2022.54 --> 2025.78]  I go by Linus Tech or Linus Tech Tips or whatever else.
[2025.78 --> 2030.04]  Not because I think it's better, but because I think it's...
[2030.04 --> 2033.00]  It just is what I did in the first place and I can't change it.
[2033.04 --> 2033.50]  Thanks, Google.
[2033.50 --> 2035.80]  So that's where we're at.
[2035.90 --> 2039.86]  How I've always used the internet and, like, including forum signup and everything that
[2039.86 --> 2044.26]  I've always done, until fairly recently when I've had a public persona, is I've used this
[2044.26 --> 2046.72]  thing, which is called fakenamegenerator.com.
[2046.72 --> 2054.74]  And all you have to do is put in a gender, a name set, which there's a lot of different
[2054.74 --> 2058.72]  name sets to choose from, and a country, which there's also tons of different countries to
[2058.72 --> 2059.14]  choose from.
[2059.30 --> 2063.12]  And it gives you, like, all the form fillable information.
[2063.68 --> 2064.06]  Wow.
[2064.18 --> 2065.78]  That you could, like, possibly need.
[2065.86 --> 2067.46]  It even gives you a fake job.
[2067.66 --> 2069.46]  It even gives you a fake SSN.
[2069.56 --> 2070.98]  It gives you a fake vehicle.
[2070.98 --> 2072.98]  It gives you a fake vehicle.
[2073.46 --> 2075.72]  I drive a 2004 Lexus LFC.
[2076.00 --> 2076.60]  What do you drive?
[2077.06 --> 2079.34]  Apparently a 1995 Hyundai Elantra.
[2080.12 --> 2080.60]  Yeah!
[2081.76 --> 2083.98]  My name is apparently Stacy B. Warner.
[2084.30 --> 2084.54]  Wow.
[2084.88 --> 2085.44]  That's interesting.
[2085.50 --> 2086.58]  Mine's Justin M. Anderson.
[2088.48 --> 2089.42]  You got something to tell me?
[2091.34 --> 2093.86]  Mind you, you're 29 and I'm 68, so...
[2093.86 --> 2094.36]  Right!
[2094.36 --> 2097.66]  As much cooler than you as I am right now, I'll be dead soon.
[2097.96 --> 2098.22]  Yeah.
[2098.90 --> 2099.26]  Yeah.
[2099.52 --> 2103.56]  I haven't, like, I don't know, I haven't put in any, yeah, the gender set to random and
[2103.56 --> 2108.90]  stuff, but that's what I used to do, mainly when I was younger, because I just didn't want
[2108.90 --> 2110.06]  to give my information to people.
[2110.10 --> 2111.64]  And I still don't, normally.
[2112.42 --> 2116.90]  Like, I think I have my real information filled in and just a few main services that
[2116.90 --> 2119.98]  I'm really worried about, it would be very damaging if I lost them.
[2120.14 --> 2120.44]  Right.
[2120.44 --> 2123.22]  So that if I called up and they're like, what is all your information, I could be like,
[2123.28 --> 2125.20]  well, I know that.
[2125.30 --> 2127.50]  I don't have to make this stuff up because...
[2127.50 --> 2127.72]  Yeah.
[2127.86 --> 2130.86]  And if they're like, oh, we need to see, like, an ID.
[2131.14 --> 2131.40]  Right.
[2131.50 --> 2135.74]  Because there's a few different services that'll do that, then I can actually show my real ID
[2135.74 --> 2136.22]  and it's fine.
[2136.22 --> 2141.00]  You know, the funny thing about that whole thing is I'm not, I'm not sure how I feel
[2141.00 --> 2145.24]  about people being, people using a real identity online for certain things.
[2145.48 --> 2147.72]  For some stuff, I, like, I don't...
[2147.72 --> 2153.02]  Okay, again, so my problem is that I wanted to go by an alias because my alias is much
[2153.02 --> 2156.62]  more well-known than my actual name, but...
[2156.62 --> 2157.94]  But your alias is...
[2157.94 --> 2159.44]  I mean, well, it's part of my name.
[2159.52 --> 2162.32]  And there aren't that many Linuses, so it's really not very private.
[2162.56 --> 2162.80]  Yeah.
[2163.26 --> 2168.56]  Compared to if I went by, you know, Bob the PC Builder, as if that wasn't going to result
[2168.56 --> 2168.90]  in a lawsuit.
[2168.90 --> 2170.72]  Tech Builder TV 15.
[2170.72 --> 2171.92]  Something like that.
[2172.46 --> 2178.52]  For some things online, I still don't mind people using their real names because removing
[2178.52 --> 2182.04]  that anonymity does remove a little bit of buttheadness.
[2182.24 --> 2186.68]  Yeah, but then at the same time, if someone, even if you're saying something that isn't
[2186.68 --> 2190.72]  buttheadness and someone takes offense to it somehow, it's extremely dangerous.
[2190.72 --> 2196.84]  There are 100,000 legitimate, really great reasons to not have to reveal your identity
[2196.84 --> 2197.16]  online.
[2197.36 --> 2198.14]  Totally get it.
[2198.52 --> 2203.42]  I think there would be interesting places like the FCC forum, but then that's also scary
[2203.42 --> 2205.26]  because government could be pissed at you right now.
[2205.26 --> 2205.66]  Exactly.
[2205.88 --> 2207.46]  So I just don't think it's that cut and dried.
[2207.54 --> 2208.60]  And apparently neither does Google.
[2208.70 --> 2213.96]  They're still defending their old position of asking for people's real names as they continue.
[2214.14 --> 2218.10]  So originally they, what, allowed nicknames, and then now they're just removing the whole
[2218.10 --> 2218.48]  thing entirely.
[2218.48 --> 2223.50]  So as they've stepped back from that hardline policy, they're still saying that the old
[2223.50 --> 2224.72]  one was what it was.
[2225.22 --> 2225.28]  Yeah.
[2225.80 --> 2229.68]  Which I guess leads us into, yes.
[2229.82 --> 2230.12]  Does it?
[2230.20 --> 2230.32]  What?
[2230.40 --> 2231.52]  Our sponsor spots.
[2231.54 --> 2232.58]  Oh, okay.
[2233.06 --> 2233.58]  All right.
[2233.68 --> 2235.82]  So let's go ahead and search for that hashtag.
[2236.02 --> 2237.78]  I'm going to, I'm going to give you the hashtag now.
[2237.86 --> 2238.94]  So tag your friend.
[2239.58 --> 2240.92]  Oh, we're doing this on the show.
[2241.04 --> 2242.00]  Yeah, we're doing this on the show.
[2242.16 --> 2242.34]  Cool.
[2242.48 --> 2246.20]  We're giving away $120 worth of 5-4 clothing live.
[2246.20 --> 2247.42]  I should have tweeted someone.
[2247.42 --> 2248.84]  You should have tweeted someone.
[2248.98 --> 2249.54]  Go for it.
[2249.64 --> 2250.20]  Do it now.
[2250.42 --> 2251.42]  Oh my God.
[2252.18 --> 2254.78]  Please note, employees and anyone affiliated with employees of Latinx Media Group cannot
[2254.78 --> 2255.04]  win.
[2255.20 --> 2256.52]  But you can go ahead and tweet it anyway.
[2256.58 --> 2256.86]  I don't care.
[2257.04 --> 2257.22]  Damn it.
[2258.02 --> 2260.22]  I'm going to tweet it to someone anyways, just to confuse them.
[2260.38 --> 2261.16]  I'm just going to go ahead.
[2261.20 --> 2264.82]  I'm going to post this in the Twitch chat so you guys have a chance to give you and your
[2264.82 --> 2266.86]  friend, because I'm just breaking all the rules.
[2267.16 --> 2272.10]  You and your friend, a chance to win $120 worth of clothing from 5-4 while I go ahead
[2272.10 --> 2274.50]  and cover what exactly 5-4 is.
[2274.62 --> 2276.58]  So first, I have to remove my earpiece.
[2276.58 --> 2277.44]  Are you stripping on camera again?
[2277.58 --> 2277.74]  Yeah.
[2277.86 --> 2279.34]  I'm stripping on camera all the time.
[2279.34 --> 2280.06]  You could just put it on top of your current shirt.
[2280.14 --> 2280.98]  No, it's really warm in here.
[2281.08 --> 2282.18]  You are kind of stripping on camera.
[2282.22 --> 2283.34]  I'm kind of stripping on camera.
[2283.62 --> 2286.54]  I'm going to cover my nipples this week with the 5-4 club logo.
[2287.90 --> 2288.30]  Censorship.
[2288.54 --> 2289.24]  5-4 censorship.
[2289.46 --> 2290.06]  Is it going to do it properly?
[2290.42 --> 2291.12]  I'm going to try.
[2291.24 --> 2292.32]  You're doing pretty good so far.
[2292.34 --> 2293.28]  Yeah, I'm doing pretty good so far.
[2293.62 --> 2295.92]  It's like, do they really want their logo on top of my nipples?
[2297.04 --> 2297.88]  One of these days, I'm going to...
[2297.88 --> 2301.58]  Well, you're kind of like one of those, like, I don't know what they're called, but those
[2301.58 --> 2303.52]  swimsuits for girls that don't have straps.
[2303.86 --> 2304.64]  They just go across.
[2304.86 --> 2306.76]  Now I'm censoring their logo with their logo.
[2309.64 --> 2312.50]  One of these days, they're just going to be like, we're sick of this guy's crap.
[2313.76 --> 2314.28]  Damn it.
[2314.66 --> 2317.66]  He's going to keep pushing the boundaries of what he can get away with when he talks about
[2317.66 --> 2318.04]  our company.
[2318.26 --> 2320.04]  The next thing you're going to do, though, because they're mad about the
[2320.04 --> 2320.92]  logo thing.
[2321.04 --> 2322.10]  You're just going to slide this up.
[2322.70 --> 2324.28]  Oh, no, you can't slide that up.
[2324.52 --> 2327.86]  That was going to be like, we can be like the guy from Star Trek and have, like, the eye
[2327.86 --> 2328.44]  cover thing.
[2329.16 --> 2329.54]  All right.
[2329.78 --> 2332.00]  Hashtag Linus5-4.
[2332.16 --> 2337.88]  I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to just randomly, I don't know.
[2338.02 --> 2338.42]  Okay.
[2339.10 --> 2342.42]  Steve G. Seems like he has a pretty cool name.
[2342.54 --> 2343.72]  Let's see if he did it right.
[2343.72 --> 2343.78]  All right.
[2344.22 --> 2348.56]  So, Steve G., you got, here we go, Linus Screenshare.
[2349.38 --> 2350.80]  Check out 5-4.
[2351.10 --> 2356.72]  Hashtag Linus5-4 and tags presumably his buddy, Brian Miller, 1-1-1-1.
[2357.68 --> 2358.08]  All right.
[2358.18 --> 2361.52]  Steve G., I'm going to go ahead and follow you on the Twitters here.
[2362.22 --> 2363.80]  And you are the big winner.
[2364.14 --> 2364.50]  Congratulations.
[2365.20 --> 2366.68]  So, go ahead and send me a DM.
[2366.82 --> 2368.46]  We'll get your information sorted out.
[2368.90 --> 2372.54]  And you get $120 worth of clothing from 5-4.
[2372.66 --> 2375.76]  But, of course, we have to tell you about 5-4 service.
[2375.84 --> 2379.94]  So, basically, if you hate shopping, 5-4 is designed for you.
[2380.02 --> 2383.56]  If you hate people looking at you like they're judging you and you pick the wrong clothes in
[2383.56 --> 2383.94]  the store.
[2384.18 --> 2385.00]  Do you get that feeling?
[2385.22 --> 2385.46]  No.
[2386.06 --> 2386.36]  Really?
[2386.76 --> 2386.98]  No.
[2387.08 --> 2387.58]  I do.
[2387.84 --> 2388.52]  I just...
[2388.52 --> 2389.70]  I get really anxious.
[2390.16 --> 2392.26]  I don't care at all.
[2392.70 --> 2396.76]  But then that also makes the shopping experience not good and also helps with 5-4.
[2396.96 --> 2397.44]  You know what the...
[2397.44 --> 2398.74]  Because then I don't have to care.
[2398.84 --> 2399.50]  It just shows up.
[2400.14 --> 2402.52]  The problem for me is that I...
[2403.70 --> 2404.38]  Like, I...
[2404.38 --> 2404.56]  Okay.
[2404.86 --> 2407.78]  The problem for me is I have, like, this weird mental block.
[2408.08 --> 2414.24]  Where, like, if you look bad because you don't care and you obviously just picked up whatever,
[2414.86 --> 2416.88]  then I kind of get that.
[2416.88 --> 2422.12]  Whereas if you look bad, even though you obviously tried really hard to look good...
[2422.12 --> 2422.50]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2422.60 --> 2423.96]  I can get a little judgy.
[2424.06 --> 2424.42]  Me too.
[2424.72 --> 2426.18]  I get the exact same thing, actually.
[2426.28 --> 2427.06]  That's a very good point.
[2427.12 --> 2428.42]  I never thought about that before, though.
[2428.42 --> 2434.38]  So when I'm shopping, I fall into this trap where either I have to pick stuff that looks
[2434.38 --> 2438.90]  like I don't care and I'll never look that good, or I have to try to pick stuff that looks
[2438.90 --> 2441.80]  like I tried and risk looking like a dumbass.
[2442.46 --> 2443.28]  So I just...
[2443.28 --> 2443.64]  I hate shopping.
[2443.68 --> 2447.86]  So anyway, the way 5-4 works is they've got your own personal stylist that goes through
[2447.86 --> 2449.78]  and handpicks stuff to send you every month.
[2449.78 --> 2455.00]  You get $120 sticker price worth of clothing for $60 every month.
[2455.22 --> 2461.28]  And if you use our code here, bit.ly slash LinusFFC, and offer code Linus, you get $15
[2461.28 --> 2463.12]  off of your first package.
[2463.52 --> 2465.70]  So the quality of the clothing is nice.
[2465.78 --> 2467.24]  We've got lots of it around here.
[2467.68 --> 2469.60]  And basically, you don't have to worry about it.
[2469.60 --> 2475.78]  You do a quick survey, 60 seconds, and you enter your shoe size, and you kind of pick
[2475.78 --> 2476.90]  a couple things that you think are good.
[2476.94 --> 2479.08]  I did it in 54 seconds or something like that.
[2479.36 --> 2481.92]  And then you are signed up and ready to rock.
[2482.14 --> 2483.18]  So there you go, guys.
[2483.92 --> 2484.46]  What's up?
[2484.64 --> 2485.38]  I'm going to test it.
[2485.44 --> 2486.04]  I'm going to see how fast I'm going.
[2486.04 --> 2487.04]  You're going to see how fast you can do it?
[2487.06 --> 2487.54]  On a laptop.
[2487.72 --> 2490.82]  In the meantime, I actually have another giveaway.
[2491.02 --> 2492.18]  So Squarespace is back.
[2492.26 --> 2495.92]  Did you know that Squarespace is one of our longest running sponsors on the show?
[2496.06 --> 2496.78]  I'm not surprised.
[2496.96 --> 2498.14]  Our guys actually really like them.
[2498.42 --> 2498.66]  Yeah.
[2498.66 --> 2501.36]  And we use them both personally and for business.
[2501.82 --> 2503.06]  So there you go.
[2503.16 --> 2504.00]  Squarespace is awesome.
[2504.10 --> 2505.18]  What do they actually do?
[2505.26 --> 2507.44]  For those of you who still don't know, don't worry.
[2507.48 --> 2508.58]  I'm not going to play the song again.
[2508.96 --> 2515.28]  What Squarespace does is they have flexible, beautiful websites that are easy to use and
[2515.28 --> 2516.32]  yet customizable.
[2516.80 --> 2521.90]  All you got to do is sign up for a two-week trial over on squarespace.com slash Linus,
[2521.98 --> 2523.92]  preferably, so I get credit for the referral.
[2524.46 --> 2528.64]  And the idea is that whether people are browsing your site on a phone or on a phone,
[2528.64 --> 2532.36]  on a PC or whatever kind of device, tablet, whatever, it's going to look good.
[2532.52 --> 2536.08]  It's going to operate correctly, which can be a huge problem.
[2536.08 --> 2541.86]  Even with mostly turnkey solutions that involve picking a theme and then uploading your own
[2541.86 --> 2544.74]  content into it, it's going to be mostly functional.
[2544.80 --> 2545.58]  Well, not mostly functional.
[2545.66 --> 2548.52]  It will be functional unlike the other ones that are mostly functional and it'll look
[2548.52 --> 2549.10]  good doing it.
[2549.14 --> 2550.24]  The performance is good.
[2550.24 --> 2555.18]  Even on things like our linusmediagroup.com site, I find, okay, I mean, this is cool.
[2555.28 --> 2557.08]  I can operate my image slider with my touchscreen.
[2557.30 --> 2559.60]  Stuff that I wouldn't have necessary...
[2559.60 --> 2560.28]  How long did it take you?
[2560.34 --> 2560.96]  48 seconds.
[2560.96 --> 2564.30]  And I sat on one question for a while and then remembered that I was timed and then
[2564.30 --> 2564.68]  kept going.
[2565.18 --> 2565.64]  So there you go.
[2565.70 --> 2567.10]  It actually doesn't take very long.
[2567.18 --> 2567.46]  It's pretty good.
[2567.46 --> 2568.56]  You still have to enter your email and password.
[2569.16 --> 2570.58]  So maybe that's your extra 12 seconds.
[2570.76 --> 2573.24]  But anyway, the point is we love Squarespace.
[2573.44 --> 2574.12]  We use them all the time.
[2574.18 --> 2576.84]  They're inexpensive and we've even stress tested it.
[2577.04 --> 2579.40]  We have taken down a lot of websites on the WAN show.
[2579.40 --> 2579.84]  Yeah, we have.
[2579.94 --> 2581.04]  We took down Noctua once.
[2581.04 --> 2581.48]  Yeah, we did.
[2582.08 --> 2583.94]  Which was kind of funny because we love Noctua.
[2584.24 --> 2587.00]  Just by saying, hey guys, something, something, Noctua.
[2587.22 --> 2589.32]  I wanted to show them a product or something, I think.
[2589.58 --> 2591.52]  And everyone went there and the website went down.
[2591.60 --> 2596.82]  We have never been able to take down a Squarespace website with the WAN show flooding it.
[2596.82 --> 2601.56]  So as much as the plans are affordable, they can also scale depending on your needs.
[2601.68 --> 2606.72]  Your portfolio, you can do a blog, you can do a store, lots and lots of different stuff
[2606.72 --> 2607.32]  built into it.
[2607.34 --> 2610.34]  It will take, like, naturally because it's a website, if you have zero visitors, then
[2610.34 --> 2612.02]  you have 2,000, 5,000 visitors.
[2612.22 --> 2614.68]  It might take, like, a second to catch up.
[2614.68 --> 2616.12]  But we've never taken one down.
[2616.62 --> 2616.88]  Yes.
[2616.96 --> 2619.38]  We've slowed it down at the beginning and then it'll go like, oh, okay, I'm good.
[2619.46 --> 2620.52]  And then it'll be able to manage it.
[2620.74 --> 2621.78]  We've never actually taken one down.
[2621.78 --> 2626.00]  That was actually pretty funny because that was a live demo where I'd never tested it before.
[2626.00 --> 2628.92]  And I was like, let's see if we can take down minusmediagroup.com.
[2628.98 --> 2629.92]  This will be a benchmark.
[2630.28 --> 2633.32]  Because I do all kinds of stuff my sponsors hate on my show, I think.
[2633.46 --> 2634.76]  Or have the potential to hate.
[2635.02 --> 2637.80]  Misquoting, making them agree to give even more people clothes.
[2638.06 --> 2639.04]  Stress testing them.
[2639.04 --> 2639.90]  Stress testing websites.
[2640.02 --> 2641.02]  Without them knowing it's coming.
[2641.40 --> 2645.54]  And what happened was it just kind of, for about 5 seconds, 10 seconds, it was like...
[2645.54 --> 2647.26]  And then it was fine.
[2647.40 --> 2647.50]  Yeah.
[2647.50 --> 2648.58]  All right.
[2648.72 --> 2650.42]  So, the way to win.
[2650.70 --> 2652.76]  Two weeks ago, we did a Squarespace giveaway.
[2653.06 --> 2655.36]  You guys had to tweet with hashtag line of Squarespace.
[2655.70 --> 2657.24]  So I love it when you guys tweet me.
[2657.34 --> 2658.38]  Hashtag line of Squarespace.
[2658.68 --> 2659.76]  Send me your trial sites.
[2659.94 --> 2662.16]  Because you can get a two-week trial for free at any time.
[2662.44 --> 2665.42]  And I said last week, in two weeks or two weeks ago, whatever.
[2665.64 --> 2668.52]  The point is, Brandon Olson, you won.
[2669.28 --> 2669.76]  Hooray.
[2669.84 --> 2670.24]  Hooray.
[2670.98 --> 2671.50]  Yay, Brandon.
[2671.50 --> 2673.22]  So here's Brandon's website.
[2673.50 --> 2677.82]  You can go ahead and you can check out his different pictures and stuff.
[2677.92 --> 2679.42]  I don't actually know what any of this stuff is.
[2679.52 --> 2682.68]  Apparently, some of it is like cutting hair and other stuff.
[2682.82 --> 2684.16]  Oh, I guess it's probably a photographer.
[2684.48 --> 2684.50]  Yeah.
[2684.54 --> 2687.50]  I was just going to say, if he's a photographer, he takes really good photos.
[2687.50 --> 2687.88]  Ah, yes.
[2687.98 --> 2688.34]  Photography.
[2688.56 --> 2690.18]  If he's a barber shop, I can't tell.
[2690.18 --> 2691.60]  So we got some street stuff.
[2692.26 --> 2693.24]  Here's like a market.
[2693.64 --> 2694.86]  Look at the way it works.
[2694.90 --> 2695.96]  And it actually works.
[2696.50 --> 2697.52]  Oh, what are these?
[2697.62 --> 2698.78]  Oh, I don't know if he said all this stuff.
[2698.86 --> 2699.24]  Oh, okay.
[2699.32 --> 2699.44]  Cool.
[2699.60 --> 2701.20]  So it just takes that and it rotates it.
[2701.50 --> 2703.92]  I haven't actually played around with all their different templates.
[2704.08 --> 2707.24]  They have about 20 different templates, depending on what kind of a site you want.
[2707.46 --> 2709.74]  And then they're all optimized to work in different ways.
[2709.78 --> 2710.46]  But there you go.
[2710.84 --> 2712.22]  Brandon Olson, enjoy.
[2713.18 --> 2716.14]  And thank you very much for participating in our little giveaway here.
[2716.60 --> 2722.74]  Speaking of giveaways, I am aware that we're doing the G550 draw on the show today.
[2722.86 --> 2724.66]  And we will do it, but it will be later.
[2725.36 --> 2726.52]  It will be at the end of the show.
[2726.84 --> 2730.22]  So if you guys want to peace out and come back at the end of the show, that's fine.
[2730.22 --> 2733.08]  If you want to watch it in the archive later, that's fine, too.
[2733.14 --> 2734.76]  It's not going to affect your chances to win or anything.
[2735.38 --> 2736.68]  But I'm just trying to say, guys.
[2736.68 --> 2736.86]  I don't think it's fine.
[2737.30 --> 2738.34]  You don't think it's fine?
[2738.42 --> 2741.08]  No, I think if they want to watch it in the archive, I think they have to watch it twice.
[2741.34 --> 2742.32]  They have to watch it twice?
[2743.40 --> 2744.94]  They have to watch it live right now.
[2745.16 --> 2746.22]  What the hell are you talking about?
[2746.22 --> 2749.00]  This is how the internet works.
[2749.18 --> 2752.44]  They can't close this tab or else they'll break the entirety of the internet.
[2753.06 --> 2753.28]  All right.
[2753.30 --> 2756.92]  So anyway, guys, thanks to our sponsors, 5-4 and Squarespace, for making this show possible.
[2757.04 --> 2759.04]  Without sponsors, we can't make this show.
[2759.42 --> 2760.80]  I mean, we could, but we'd have no money.
[2761.46 --> 2763.00]  And then we wouldn't be able to make the show anymore.
[2763.02 --> 2767.62]  We'd be like in the garage wearing parkas because it's so cool.
[2768.02 --> 2768.26]  Okay.
[2768.34 --> 2771.80]  You should not say stuff like that because of how many people have been like,
[2771.80 --> 2774.86]  I really liked the show when you were in the garage with parkas.
[2775.54 --> 2776.50]  It was...
[2776.50 --> 2778.04]  We were legitimately uncomfortable.
[2778.48 --> 2779.58]  It was not good.
[2781.24 --> 2782.72]  It's like, that actually sucked.
[2782.98 --> 2783.46]  It did.
[2784.04 --> 2784.88]  We were cold.
[2785.00 --> 2787.58]  We weren't wearing them because we were Canadian and making a joke.
[2787.86 --> 2788.10]  Yeah.
[2788.60 --> 2789.56]  Now it's the opposite.
[2789.74 --> 2790.86]  Now we're like, what the hell, Canada?
[2790.94 --> 2791.70]  Why is it so hot?
[2791.88 --> 2792.46]  I know.
[2792.56 --> 2793.90]  It's so hot in this room.
[2794.42 --> 2795.72]  I'm not buying air conditioning, though.
[2796.16 --> 2799.50]  We're paying for the electricity for air conditioning that is purchased for you.
[2799.88 --> 2800.50]  That's right.
[2800.98 --> 2801.42]  Ridiculous.
[2801.80 --> 2802.24]  Anyways.
[2802.64 --> 2804.22]  I'm basically a terrible person.
[2805.16 --> 2805.64]  Alright.
[2805.90 --> 2807.30]  So we've got our next story here.
[2807.40 --> 2809.38]  The LG G3 Beat.
[2810.96 --> 2811.40]  Really?
[2811.82 --> 2812.26]  Why?
[2813.10 --> 2816.22]  I mean, when I heard this, look at this.
[2816.56 --> 2819.64]  Ads for the Highlander shirt all over my internet.
[2820.62 --> 2821.62]  That's so funny.
[2821.74 --> 2821.90]  Okay.
[2821.96 --> 2823.08]  Does anyone else get those?
[2823.96 --> 2825.00]  Like, is anyone else fancy?
[2825.16 --> 2826.20]  I'm asking the...
[2826.20 --> 2826.46]  Oh, no.
[2826.54 --> 2828.34]  I've heard from people on the forum and stuff.
[2828.44 --> 2828.82]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2828.98 --> 2829.76]  That's so cool.
[2829.76 --> 2833.32]  Yeah, and people on Twitch chat last week were like, yeah, yeah, it's all over my internet.
[2833.54 --> 2834.66]  I'm just like, that's awesome.
[2834.76 --> 2835.22]  That's so cool.
[2835.22 --> 2838.12]  So that's for the Teespring campaign to get a commemorative Highlander shirt.
[2838.22 --> 2839.32]  There's four days left.
[2839.32 --> 2841.94]  Actually, we upgraded the hoodies.
[2842.32 --> 2843.34]  Is that done now?
[2843.34 --> 2843.92]  Yeah, it's done.
[2844.20 --> 2848.18]  So we didn't change the price of the hoodies, but they're now Canvas Something hoodies instead
[2848.18 --> 2848.96]  of Gildan hoodies.
[2849.32 --> 2851.24]  So I'm picking up a hoodie when I get a minute.
[2851.26 --> 2851.96]  I'm getting at least one then.
[2851.96 --> 2852.18]  Yeah.
[2852.18 --> 2854.46]  Because those look a fair bit nicer.
[2854.54 --> 2856.80]  I love how it's an out of number that makes no sense.
[2857.04 --> 2859.14]  Yeah, 346 sold out of 150.
[2859.66 --> 2862.52]  So it's teespring.com slash Highlanderland if you guys want to check that out.
[2862.70 --> 2864.56]  We already hit the target, so no pressure.
[2864.88 --> 2867.50]  We are definitely shipping them, and I'm super excited about that.
[2867.58 --> 2869.38]  Anyway, so the LG G3 Beat.
[2869.44 --> 2872.96]  When I first heard this name, I kind of went, okay, LG G3 Beat.
[2872.96 --> 2878.64]  So it's probably like a music-optimized version of it, because HTC did that, where they had
[2878.64 --> 2880.72]  like, it was just a software layer or something.
[2882.68 --> 2887.90]  I thought it was legitimately like, they're like, oh yeah, there's some phone that's better
[2887.90 --> 2888.84]  than the LG G3.
[2889.34 --> 2890.80]  I didn't even think it was an LG phone.
[2890.80 --> 2892.38]  So you thought Beat sounded better.
[2892.88 --> 2894.72]  Oh, LG G3 Beat.
[2895.72 --> 2898.06]  Because you know how sometimes people title things?
[2898.84 --> 2902.94]  There's a news way of titling something, and you can say, LG G3 Beat.
[2902.96 --> 2904.28]  Beat, as in something was-
[2904.28 --> 2910.52]  So this headline, if you missed the capitalized B, it reads, LG G3 Beat with 5-inch HT display,
[2910.90 --> 2912.66]  laser autofocus camera goes official.
[2913.12 --> 2914.04]  It's like, what does that actually mean?
[2914.04 --> 2917.84]  It sounded kind of weird, but I thought it was something had beat the LG G3.
[2918.10 --> 2919.66]  And I started reading it, and I was like, oh, what?
[2920.08 --> 2922.24]  And because the photo, they look so similar.
[2922.40 --> 2923.12]  Yeah, they look basically the same.
[2923.12 --> 2925.98]  I thought it might have just been a zoom out of the same phone or something.
[2926.08 --> 2926.26]  Right.
[2926.84 --> 2928.48]  Yeah, it did not catch on right away.
[2928.58 --> 2929.38]  All right, so here we go.
[2929.38 --> 2934.66]  It's got a 5-inch HD, so that is 720p IPS display.
[2934.84 --> 2937.30]  And again, back to the iPhone 6.
[2937.62 --> 2939.16]  I don't mind that.
[2939.56 --> 2944.66]  I don't think it's perfect, but it's so much better than not 720p.
[2944.76 --> 2946.92]  So whatever we were using before, something by 480.
[2947.12 --> 2948.86]  It's so much better than that.
[2948.86 --> 2952.84]  Yeah, that distance, or that difference, sorry, is extremely drastic.
[2952.86 --> 2953.62]  I'm okay with it.
[2953.82 --> 2957.98]  They're talking about the screen-to-body ratio, although I think they mean percentage,
[2958.26 --> 2961.42]  of 74.1% screen to the rest body.
[2961.66 --> 2967.26]  So it's very much about the screen experience, just like the G3 with its very slim bezels.
[2967.78 --> 2971.70]  The specs have been significantly downgraded, so you still get the laser-focused camera,
[2971.70 --> 2973.74]  but you don't get a 13-megapixel rear camera anymore.
[2973.84 --> 2975.02]  It's 8 megapixels now.
[2975.46 --> 2979.06]  And the processing power is, like, basically in the toilet.
[2979.16 --> 2985.02]  1.2 gigahertz, Cortex-A7, Adreno 305 GPU, only 1 gig of RAM compared to 2 or 3,
[2985.14 --> 2989.16]  depending on the storage capacity of the bigger one, and only 8 gigs of internal memory
[2989.16 --> 2994.44]  with a 2540 mAh battery that is fortunately also still user-removable.
[2994.64 --> 2996.54]  It still has a microSD expansion slot.
[2997.02 --> 3004.98]  And basically, I guess what I have to say here is this either validates HTC's strategy
[3004.98 --> 3010.92]  with the One Mini and the One Mini 2, where they take that same high-end build quality
[3010.92 --> 3016.84]  and look and that aluminum design, and in order to cost it down enough to really make any difference,
[3016.84 --> 3021.46]  especially for someone buying on contract, they put way lower-end specs,
[3021.54 --> 3026.08]  because honestly, those chips are not that much of the cost of a phone.
[3026.22 --> 3027.40]  Like, it's a factor.
[3027.98 --> 3032.38]  But just by downgrading the CPU, like in a computer, for example,
[3032.86 --> 3038.18]  downgrading the CPU and GPU alone, you can reduce the price of a PC by half,
[3038.34 --> 3042.08]  depending on what you're looking at, versus, like, a very high-end PC versus a low-end one.
[3042.24 --> 3042.56]  Easy.
[3042.96 --> 3044.78]  With a phone, that's not the case.
[3044.78 --> 3049.88]  We're talking about maybe they shave, you know, 20, 30, 40 bucks off the bomb cost.
[3050.00 --> 3054.78]  That's not the difference between an $800 flagship phone and a $399 phone.
[3054.98 --> 3059.22]  So when they keep that build quality in there, they can't really drive the price down that much.
[3059.26 --> 3061.04]  That's why low-end phones are plastic and stuff.
[3061.12 --> 3066.78]  So this either validates HTC's strategy of delivering much lower specs but still a really nice feel,
[3067.02 --> 3070.90]  or it's LG going down that same disastrous path, I guess.
[3071.14 --> 3071.42]  Yeah.
[3071.60 --> 3072.68]  It remains to be seen.
[3072.68 --> 3074.66]  You had a really interesting note here, though.
[3075.26 --> 3075.54]  Yeah.
[3075.54 --> 3077.36]  I want to jump into the skin performance.
[3077.48 --> 3077.80]  Yeah.
[3077.98 --> 3082.88]  With the One Mini 2, one of the articles I was looking at, I think it was the Verge article,
[3083.00 --> 3085.18]  pointed out that the One Mini 2 is...
[3085.18 --> 3085.96]  I don't want to...
[3085.96 --> 3086.88]  Okay, whoever it was.
[3086.94 --> 3087.88]  I don't remember if it was the Verge.
[3087.90 --> 3090.34]  I was reading up on it, and they basically made an interesting point.
[3090.40 --> 3093.64]  They said, the One Mini 2 is still a good phone.
[3093.64 --> 3100.26]  Even older smartphone specs, and we've gotten to that point now, can still deliver a really good experience.
[3100.26 --> 3113.08]  But the issue that I worry about here is that LG's skin is not as lightweight as Sense, or just a stock Google experience like what you have on the Moto G,
[3113.24 --> 3116.16]  which is also a very low-spec phone that still performs okay.
[3116.16 --> 3123.02]  My wife's been using one for the last few months now, and she does complain about it, but it's usable.
[3123.20 --> 3124.92]  It's not like her old phone or anything like that.
[3125.24 --> 3132.62]  So I worry, based on that LG's skin is not that lightweight if performance is going to be okay on the G3B.
[3132.62 --> 3134.32]  That is pretty interesting.
[3135.02 --> 3136.32]  Whoa, that was a loud knock.
[3137.46 --> 3138.88]  I don't know.
[3139.18 --> 3142.92]  The skin is interesting, but then at the same time, they could have a lighter weight skin.
[3143.28 --> 3143.80]  I doubt it.
[3143.90 --> 3144.54]  I doubt it.
[3144.54 --> 3144.88]  They could.
[3145.12 --> 3147.36]  Because there's certain things that are significantly lower.
[3147.48 --> 3154.36]  Like in my G3 review, I show multitasking on HTC versus LG, and their multitasking is really versatile.
[3154.62 --> 3157.38]  You can zoom in and zoom out and stuff, depending on how many things you want to see.
[3157.80 --> 3158.58]  But it's heavy.
[3158.88 --> 3160.28]  It takes a while to load.
[3160.28 --> 3163.80]  It's something that I noticed before I did a side-by-side comparison.
[3164.82 --> 3166.06]  That's never a good sign.
[3166.10 --> 3167.20]  Yeah, it's a big difference.
[3167.60 --> 3167.74]  Yeah.
[3168.44 --> 3168.84]  Interesting.
[3169.08 --> 3169.68]  I don't know.
[3170.04 --> 3175.64]  It's something that they said in here, though, is the smartphone manufacturers cannot ignore this growing segment of consumers
[3175.64 --> 3178.90]  who want the best balance of looks, features, performance, and, of course, price.
[3180.82 --> 3185.26]  I like how he says that while his company is jumping on that bandwagon at the same time.
[3185.62 --> 3189.18]  Basically, we cannot ignore this growing segment of consumers.
[3190.28 --> 3190.76]  Yes.
[3190.94 --> 3193.42]  Either way, I think they're right.
[3193.58 --> 3198.08]  It's getting to the point where a lot of people don't need the flagship phones.
[3198.26 --> 3201.80]  For a while there, you basically needed to get a flagship phone, or else you're getting a piece of crap.
[3201.88 --> 3202.42]  That's true.
[3202.88 --> 3205.08]  But the issue is that that's not even true anymore.
[3205.08 --> 3213.88]  So now consumers are being forced to choose between something with okay build quality, something like a Nexus 5, but bleeding-edge specs,
[3214.08 --> 3221.28]  versus something that's going to have LG G3 or HTC One-type aluminum backing, like that kind of stuff that really does cost a lot of money,
[3221.68 --> 3225.12]  and much, much lower-end specifications.
[3225.12 --> 3227.88]  I mean, the killer for me is the 8 gigs of onboard storage.
[3229.86 --> 3232.54]  I can live with 16 gigs as long as I have SD expansion.
[3233.04 --> 3233.14]  Yeah.
[3233.52 --> 3233.64]  Yeah.
[3234.02 --> 3237.26]  But then a lot of apps are not going to want to live off that SD card.
[3237.40 --> 3237.56]  Yeah.
[3237.64 --> 3238.22]  And even...
[3238.22 --> 3238.96]  Yeah, exactly.
[3239.22 --> 3242.02]  And games are getting bigger and bigger all the time on Android.
[3242.28 --> 3242.48]  Yeah.
[3242.48 --> 3252.32]  I mean, there's that rumor on the street about, you know, some Android gaming device that may or may not be surfacing at some point in the near future.
[3252.66 --> 3259.14]  I can't say anything, because when I don't know anything, I can speculate.
[3259.86 --> 3263.22]  So anyway, something that may or may not be coming at some point.
[3264.68 --> 3266.58]  I mean, Android is a valid gaming platform.
[3266.96 --> 3268.00]  You look at...
[3268.00 --> 3270.90]  I do most of my gaming on Android, even if I'm using GameStream.
[3271.06 --> 3271.70]  I was just going to say.
[3271.70 --> 3273.30]  No, not Android games.
[3273.42 --> 3273.62]  Yeah.
[3273.80 --> 3278.26]  But what needs to happen is game developers need to get on board the whole Android thing,
[3278.46 --> 3283.10]  but we need devices that are really delivering a great Android gaming experience, and it's that whole chicken and egg thing.
[3283.24 --> 3283.38]  Yeah.
[3283.60 --> 3288.00]  Speaking of chicken and egg things, Mozilla is attempting to improve JPEG.
[3288.10 --> 3289.26]  How do you like that segue?
[3289.26 --> 3289.76]  I like that.
[3289.86 --> 3291.24]  That was a very interesting segue.
[3291.48 --> 3291.56]  Thank you.
[3291.56 --> 3293.94]  But I like what they're doing here a lot, because...
[3293.94 --> 3294.38]  Yes!
[3295.10 --> 3297.54]  This is so much better than Google's approach.
[3297.62 --> 3299.18]  It is so much better than Google's approach.
[3299.18 --> 3304.14]  It makes so much more sense, because Google's promoting something that is only kind of work on their ecosystem.
[3304.14 --> 3309.48]  Okay, we should say what Mozilla's doing first, then we'll slam Google for being dumb.
[3310.06 --> 3311.26]  So what's Mozilla doing?
[3311.58 --> 3315.28]  Mozilla is making a new compression library for JPEG.
[3315.40 --> 3316.34]  So where is it called?
[3316.78 --> 3318.38]  Moz JPEG 2.0.
[3318.46 --> 3319.74]  M-O-Z JPEG 2.0.
[3319.74 --> 3325.04]  Which will work for when you're compiling JPEGs, but then it's read in the exact same way.
[3325.10 --> 3328.12]  So everything that reads JPEGs right now can read it just totally fine.
[3328.42 --> 3335.82]  It'll take a slightly longer amount of time to create that JPEG, but then reading it is faster.
[3336.62 --> 3340.78]  So that's awesome, because it takes, like, no time to create one right now at all.
[3341.78 --> 3342.34]  So...
[3342.34 --> 3343.58]  So, should be fine.
[3343.58 --> 3348.04]  If it takes ever so slightly longer than basically non-existent, I think it's okay.
[3348.66 --> 3351.54]  And if it's making, where is it, 30% smaller or something?
[3351.82 --> 3353.04]  I think it's about 5 to 15.
[3353.04 --> 3353.82]  5 to 15% smaller.
[3354.04 --> 3358.34]  Which isn't as good as Chrome's approach, but it actually works with everything.
[3358.78 --> 3358.96]  Yeah.
[3359.04 --> 3359.94]  Which is pretty important.
[3359.94 --> 3364.36]  And I mean, making images smaller on the web isn't the end of the world these days anymore.
[3364.60 --> 3365.52]  Like, it used to be that...
[3365.52 --> 3366.18]  It can still help.
[3366.18 --> 3370.64]  Loading images was the bulk of, you know, web traffic.
[3370.82 --> 3371.52]  Whereas now it's video.
[3371.92 --> 3372.28]  Yes.
[3372.80 --> 3377.76]  But at the same time, we're running into things like Imgur, Imgur, whatever you want to say,
[3377.86 --> 3381.10]  where instead of having a few images on the website and that being an issue,
[3381.44 --> 3383.48]  now it's the whole website is just images.
[3383.70 --> 3385.08]  So that I can actually take a little bit.
[3385.08 --> 3390.70]  So even another, let's take the average, even another 10% faster, another 10% less bandwidth
[3390.70 --> 3393.94]  used by those images, it's all going to be really positive stuff.
[3393.96 --> 3397.98]  This can really help people that are in, say, Australia, that have terrible,
[3398.12 --> 3400.78]  crap-tastic internet or other random areas around the world.
[3400.90 --> 3402.68]  Like, we complain about our internet all the time.
[3403.16 --> 3408.82]  Then mods that I have in the mod chat post a screenshot of their speed test.
[3409.00 --> 3410.26]  And I'm just like...
[3410.26 --> 3411.32]  Sad face.
[3411.40 --> 3413.52]  My internet is god-like compared to yours.
[3414.18 --> 3414.70]  So, yeah.
[3414.70 --> 3420.02]  So, by comparison, Google's been pushing their WebP, which is a still image derivative
[3420.02 --> 3424.06]  of their WebM codec, which actually is better.
[3424.28 --> 3425.54]  I mean, technically it's better.
[3425.72 --> 3429.14]  We're looking at up to 30% smaller images with WebP.
[3429.50 --> 3432.38]  But the problem, and Facebook did an experiment.
[3432.62 --> 3436.04]  Facebook, the kings of experimenting with things just randomly,
[3436.38 --> 3439.74]  did an experiment where they started serving up pages with WebP.
[3439.74 --> 3443.98]  And the problem was that no browsers other than Chrome or Opera supported it.
[3444.20 --> 3449.74]  And then problem number two is that a lot of people use Facebook as cloud storage.
[3450.10 --> 3453.98]  So, they actually upload their photos because they don't care about pixel-perfect quality
[3453.98 --> 3455.14]  being preserved forever.
[3455.34 --> 3458.96]  So, they're just uploading their photos to Facebook and then downloading them as they need them.
[3458.96 --> 3463.56]  They were downloading these WebP photos and none of their local file viewers were able to look at them.
[3463.56 --> 3469.80]  That's a big issue in my opinion because I don't necessarily use Facebook as web photo storage.
[3469.88 --> 3470.60]  I never have.
[3470.88 --> 3474.62]  But I have downloaded images off Facebook when I'm like, say,
[3474.78 --> 3479.00]  I need a new Twitter banner and the Facebook thing is really wide.
[3479.00 --> 3483.52]  So, like, my brother's Facebook thing or my mom's Facebook thing,
[3483.66 --> 3487.10]  if she wants a Twitter banner, I can be like, yeah, just go to your Facebook one,
[3487.22 --> 3491.62]  right-click on it, view image, save image, upload it again to Twitter, and it's probably fine.
[3492.82 --> 3497.16]  Considering so many different websites are moving to this, like, wide, big banner kind of style,
[3497.26 --> 3500.54]  you can just bounce them across each other and you can do that from any location
[3500.54 --> 3502.76]  if you have them on one of those services.
[3503.28 --> 3505.80]  So, being unable to download them again is kind of dumb.
[3505.80 --> 3510.26]  So, I mean, maybe a long time in the future,
[3510.44 --> 3514.48]  but you look at how long it takes to really move the dial on a web standard,
[3514.74 --> 3516.28]  I mean, Flash is still here.
[3516.94 --> 3517.34]  Why?
[3517.42 --> 3522.20]  It's still causing browser crashes for me on a regular basis.
[3522.60 --> 3525.38]  Everyone else was like, wow, Mozilla's screwing up right now.
[3525.42 --> 3526.88]  And then I was like, wow, no, it's not.
[3526.96 --> 3530.18]  I'm just at, like, 98% or 95% RAM usage.
[3530.64 --> 3532.28]  A gig of that was Flash.
[3533.32 --> 3535.70]  It's like, wow, really?
[3535.80 --> 3536.02]  Yeah.
[3537.10 --> 3537.66]  Why?
[3538.66 --> 3539.48]  Go away.
[3539.52 --> 3541.06]  I have, like, one YouTube video open.
[3541.14 --> 3541.72]  What are you doing?
[3542.64 --> 3543.06]  Yeah.
[3543.46 --> 3549.36]  So, I mean, I see something like the JPEG improvements as a much more feasible way
[3549.36 --> 3552.02]  to actually achieve something versus...
[3552.02 --> 3553.74]  So, Mozilla's trying to achieve something real,
[3554.00 --> 3560.36]  and Google's trying to achieve something that will hopefully be realistic in the future,
[3560.48 --> 3561.24]  maybe, or something.
[3561.48 --> 3561.74]  Yeah, maybe.
[3562.00 --> 3564.28]  So, I'm sure they could make Photo Viewer work with WebP.
[3564.28 --> 3573.38]  Speaking of things that right now are not really a thing, but could be really important in the future.
[3573.80 --> 3574.42]  Project...
[3574.42 --> 3575.22]  See, another segue.
[3575.38 --> 3575.74]  Bam!
[3575.88 --> 3576.08]  Boom.
[3576.08 --> 3576.62]  Got those segues.
[3576.62 --> 3577.62]  Anyways.
[3577.62 --> 3581.12]  Project ARA dev board ships later this month.
[3581.12 --> 3583.10]  So, the signup is actually closed now.
[3583.10 --> 3589.74]  Yesterday was the last opportunity to sign up, and Google is evaluating who gets the equipment
[3589.74 --> 3594.24]  based on how interesting their idea is, as well as something else.
[3594.24 --> 3596.80]  So, basically, they're actually going through all these submissions.
[3596.80 --> 3601.54]  But for those of you who need a refresher, Project ARA is the modular smartphone concept.
[3601.98 --> 3605.14]  Now, this is a concept image right here of, like...
[3605.14 --> 3606.00]  Remember, phone blocks.
[3606.08 --> 3607.98]  So, this is the real version of that.
[3608.22 --> 3613.18]  So, this concept image right here shows backings of something that looks like a phablet with these
[3613.18 --> 3618.78]  modules that plug into it and are going to communicate via a standardized interface so that
[3618.78 --> 3621.78]  whatever type of module you're plugging in, they'll all be able to communicate with each other,
[3622.10 --> 3624.78]  and they'll all be able to communicate, ultimately, with you.
[3624.78 --> 3626.52]  Here's a smaller one.
[3626.70 --> 3627.94]  Here's some just random modules.
[3628.40 --> 3630.22]  Well, I mean, this is the state it's in now.
[3631.94 --> 3633.28]  So, we're not there yet.
[3634.30 --> 3634.64]  Epic.
[3635.28 --> 3641.06]  But, they'll be shipping the second round of hardware sometime in the fall, I believe.
[3641.62 --> 3642.02]  Yes.
[3642.12 --> 3643.16]  First round is in.
[3643.80 --> 3647.74]  First round is soon, and then second hardware release with multiple application processors
[3647.74 --> 3648.50]  will be in the fall.
[3648.72 --> 3654.22]  Right now, it's not even close to ready, so this is very much like plug things in and see
[3654.22 --> 3658.62]  if they work stage, but it shows that they are still working on the project.
[3658.78 --> 3660.14]  They are still serious about this.
[3660.56 --> 3662.00]  And, I mean, okay.
[3663.08 --> 3666.48]  Initially, what I said about this was it's not going to make sense for anything but the
[3666.48 --> 3666.82]  low end.
[3666.82 --> 3674.06]  By the time it actually sees the light of day, I might be totally wrong.
[3674.94 --> 3678.62]  Because we're getting to the point where, like, the spec bumps don't feel them as much?
[3678.64 --> 3678.66]  Yeah.
[3678.66 --> 3682.92]  We're getting to the point where we can continue to miniaturize things, but a phone is largely
[3682.92 --> 3685.58]  fast enough for most of the things you're going to want to do with it today.
[3686.16 --> 3689.74]  Which, I mean, if we're talking about walking around with a phone and 3D mapping an environment...
[3689.74 --> 3692.64]  Yeah, and stuff like gaming is always going to get harder.
[3692.98 --> 3696.16]  But when you talk about it's fast enough to do things you want to do today, a lot of people,
[3696.66 --> 3703.40]  when you reference that, is calling, texting, very basic kind of text applications and photo
[3703.40 --> 3707.20]  applications like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, that kind of stuff.
[3707.36 --> 3712.12]  So when I said basic, I think I had the wrong concept in my mind.
[3712.12 --> 3714.40]  I was thinking basic today basic.
[3715.52 --> 3719.04]  Whereas basic by then will probably be this basic.
[3719.92 --> 3721.28]  High end today basic.
[3721.44 --> 3723.98]  And so I'm a lot more excited about it.
[3724.00 --> 3729.76]  Especially if we see technologies like that second, however many seconds it was, they could
[3729.76 --> 3731.02]  charge a Galaxy S4.
[3731.44 --> 3735.52]  Like if we see improvements in charging technology, improvements in battery technology, to the point
[3735.52 --> 3741.36]  where you can make something that isn't that bulky and really is legitimately modular, that
[3741.36 --> 3744.94]  isn't so slow, that it's only usable for basic calling and texting functionality.
[3745.34 --> 3747.80]  I'm a lot more excited about it now than I was before.
[3748.08 --> 3750.52]  So right now it's running on a fork of Android.
[3750.64 --> 3755.22]  Like it doesn't even run on regular Android because they had to Frankenstein it to allow
[3755.22 --> 3756.82]  hot swapping of components.
[3757.04 --> 3758.36]  I mean, that's the kind of thing.
[3758.44 --> 3762.90]  Guys, your phone freaks out if you unplug a micro SD card unexpectedly.
[3762.90 --> 3765.02]  It's like, yo dog, please don't do that.
[3765.02 --> 3771.50]  Whereas if we're talking about unplugging a camera, I mean, the amount of app dependencies
[3771.50 --> 3773.44]  on any piece of hardware like a camera.
[3773.52 --> 3777.36]  I mean, you install any app and it goes, this app has access to this, this, this, this, this,
[3777.36 --> 3777.64]  this, this.
[3777.64 --> 3780.94]  You start pulling out your GPS module in the middle of, right?
[3781.44 --> 3783.44]  It's going to be like, ah, no.
[3783.44 --> 3786.98]  There's a lot of stuff that needs to be figured out before this really happens, but I'm a
[3786.98 --> 3788.54]  lot more excited about it than I was before.
[3789.00 --> 3794.04]  Speaking of things that are designed to generate hype, Sony and Microsoft are talking about
[3794.04 --> 3797.30]  early access game sales on consoles.
[3797.86 --> 3803.34]  Now, neither of them is announcing that they're doing it now.
[3803.50 --> 3804.88]  That's not what's happening right now.
[3804.88 --> 3809.92]  What they've basically said is, look, we're having serious internal discussions about this.
[3809.92 --> 3817.18]  We've seen what a big deal this has been on the PC with Steam allowing games to allow early,
[3817.32 --> 3819.90]  allow players to pay for early access to them.
[3820.34 --> 3825.54]  But I think they recognize, like hopefully everyone recognizes that there are still some
[3825.54 --> 3828.56]  serious problems with this model.
[3829.22 --> 3832.76]  So the benefits are obvious, I guess.
[3832.98 --> 3834.52]  The developer gets feedback.
[3834.52 --> 3838.88]  I mean, even EA is recognizing the benefits.
[3838.88 --> 3839.78]  Okay, hold on.
[3839.88 --> 3840.76]  One step back.
[3840.82 --> 3844.82]  You look at Star Citizen, where they're being extremely open about the development process.
[3845.28 --> 3847.84]  Here's the roadblock we're stuck with right now.
[3848.14 --> 3853.74]  Here's the milestone that, unfortunately, we keep not hitting because we're actually sharing
[3853.74 --> 3858.96]  the internal targets with you guys instead of padding it the way that a game developer
[3858.96 --> 3859.76]  would normally do.
[3859.88 --> 3860.32]  Okay.
[3860.50 --> 3867.22]  So there's that completely crowdfunded project and then crowd interactive development process.
[3867.22 --> 3868.38]  Then there's the next step.
[3868.50 --> 3872.74]  There's what EA finally has opened their eyes to, what they did with the Battlefield Hardline
[3872.74 --> 3876.46]  beta, where they went, okay, we want people to play this game.
[3876.84 --> 3881.22]  We want to know that it works properly before we ask for people's money.
[3881.68 --> 3885.58]  Then there's early access.
[3885.58 --> 3891.26]  And so the benefits of developers getting feedback before they release a game are great, especially
[3891.26 --> 3897.56]  on the PC, where so many game-breaking bugs can have to do with obscure hardware configurations.
[3898.40 --> 3902.02]  But the problem is asking for people to pay for beta software.
[3903.70 --> 3907.46]  Paying for early access is a big problem to me.
[3907.52 --> 3908.90]  It used to be so cool.
[3908.90 --> 3909.76]  Yes.
[3909.88 --> 3913.70]  Like I used to like when you had to sign up for a beta, it was like this huge resume
[3913.70 --> 3914.18]  process.
[3914.74 --> 3918.86]  And one of the sections, which was always extremely important, was what games have you
[3918.86 --> 3920.00]  done betas for before?
[3920.32 --> 3920.52]  Yeah.
[3920.64 --> 3923.32]  And like how engaged are you in betas and like all this kind of stuff.
[3923.34 --> 3924.08]  And it was a big deal.
[3924.12 --> 3927.24]  And if you got into a beta for something, like it was a...
[3927.24 --> 3927.32]  Wow.
[3927.52 --> 3928.20]  It was cool.
[3928.24 --> 3929.88]  You know, like you were a cool dude.
[3930.26 --> 3930.52]  Yeah.
[3930.58 --> 3933.52]  And people were like, oh, holy crap, you've betaed for all these different games.
[3933.98 --> 3934.82]  And it's like, yeah, yeah.
[3934.82 --> 3936.66]  And you learn like how to test things.
[3936.68 --> 3937.76]  And it was actually kind of interesting.
[3938.02 --> 3942.24]  There was one point in time where beta testing games could have gone on a resume.
[3943.42 --> 3943.78]  Right.
[3943.88 --> 3946.62]  Like the fact that you were accepted into all these different betas because it could have
[3946.62 --> 3947.24]  gone on a resume.
[3948.08 --> 3950.08]  Now you buy into it.
[3951.04 --> 3952.16]  Like what?
[3953.30 --> 3954.32]  What, what, what, what, what?
[3954.42 --> 3957.84]  We took that hype of like, yeah, I got into a beta.
[3957.94 --> 3958.70]  This is super cool.
[3958.88 --> 3963.42]  And turned it into, it's just generally cool to be into betas.
[3963.42 --> 3965.68]  Which made it so that betas weren't betas anymore.
[3965.88 --> 3967.66]  And you look at Gmail beta.
[3968.08 --> 3968.34]  Yeah.
[3968.54 --> 3972.74]  Gmail, Minecraft beta where things last forever and it makes no sense.
[3973.04 --> 3974.68]  And then they started charging you for it.
[3974.68 --> 3976.24]  And it devalues the beta word.
[3976.38 --> 3978.36]  Like it's, it's taken the meaning out of the beta word.
[3978.50 --> 3980.04]  Beta used to mean it's not finished.
[3980.36 --> 3983.80]  Now beta seems to mean it's, well, it's mostly finished.
[3983.88 --> 3986.16]  We're just not quite ready to call it finished.
[3986.36 --> 3989.62]  We're, we're getting, we're done, but we're getting your feedback and we're going to tweak
[3989.62 --> 3992.86]  things so that when we release it, everyone sees it as being very good.
[3992.86 --> 3998.20]  And the problem with that, actually the problem with that, with betas working too well, is
[3998.20 --> 4003.18]  it changes the, the customer's perception of what a beta is and it changes their expectations
[4003.18 --> 4004.12]  of what a beta is.
[4004.28 --> 4008.38]  So all of a sudden they kind of expect a beta to be mostly there.
[4008.74 --> 4010.64]  Like a beta, sure, beta software works.
[4010.74 --> 4011.16]  No big deal.
[4011.22 --> 4013.24]  I'll run beta software on my PC all day long.
[4013.54 --> 4018.00]  And then developers recognize this change in perception and go, oh, well, why don't we
[4018.00 --> 4019.04]  just charge them for it then?
[4019.04 --> 4019.08]  Okay.
[4020.00 --> 4024.58]  And I mean, Valve has warnings like, look, if you buy into early access, you should buy
[4024.58 --> 4026.90]  it because you're really excited about the title or something.
[4026.96 --> 4030.70]  I forget the wording exactly, but they basically go, look, they might not ever get finished,
[4030.86 --> 4032.66]  but why is that acceptable?
[4032.88 --> 4033.12]  Yeah.
[4033.12 --> 4035.36]  And I mean, okay, okay, okay.
[4035.40 --> 4036.26]  Why is it acceptable?
[4036.54 --> 4036.76]  Yeah.
[4036.96 --> 4039.74]  But then the, the flip side of that is, is it really any different from what we have
[4039.74 --> 4040.02]  today?
[4040.58 --> 4042.78]  Where the development process is mostly closed.
[4042.90 --> 4047.16]  They released the game and you pay for it and it wasn't done.
[4047.16 --> 4052.64]  So basically we're just giving them our money at the same point in the development cycle.
[4052.64 --> 4054.00]  We're just calling it something different.
[4054.32 --> 4057.14]  That's why I often don't buy release games anymore.
[4057.28 --> 4059.72]  I used to be all about buying release games and pre-ordering stuff.
[4059.78 --> 4063.48]  I know that sounds weird, but honestly, at one point in time, that was fine.
[4063.60 --> 4066.06]  We need to do a shirt that's like, I paid for this.
[4066.54 --> 4068.62]  And then this just needs to like trail off.
[4069.62 --> 4071.02]  That's actually not a bad one.
[4071.32 --> 4071.52]  Yeah.
[4071.70 --> 4072.72]  Okay, guys, let us know.
[4072.72 --> 4076.60]  Maybe we'll do another Teespring campaign instead of throwing it up on the other store.
[4076.62 --> 4083.72]  Or you can buy like the, the, oh, you could, oh, what if you did like a release and I, I
[4083.72 --> 4088.36]  paid for this and have part at the end, a different color and then have like an index
[4088.36 --> 4089.80]  and have it be like release and DLC.
[4093.02 --> 4094.46]  Yeah, we got, we got to come up with something.
[4094.54 --> 4098.08]  Let us know on Twitch chat if you need us to do a, if you need us to do a beta shirt,
[4098.14 --> 4100.40]  because I think that would be pretty freaking awesome.
[4100.42 --> 4101.40]  I funded this beta.
[4101.40 --> 4102.76]  I funded this beta.
[4107.30 --> 4109.28]  So I guess that Luke's shirts are getting smaller and smaller.
[4109.40 --> 4111.76]  No, this shirt has just consistently been small.
[4112.00 --> 4112.32]  Yeah.
[4113.72 --> 4118.12]  Because you're bigger than, well, you've been kind of getting kind of jacked lately.
[4118.34 --> 4118.72]  So there's that.
[4118.72 --> 4118.82]  A little bit.
[4119.74 --> 4120.10]  Okay.
[4120.14 --> 4122.20]  I don't think there's anything else I had to say on the beta thing.
[4122.26 --> 4123.94]  I think the punchline was what it was.
[4124.02 --> 4128.76]  It was, is anything really changing if we just get people to pay for betas?
[4128.82 --> 4129.32]  No, not really.
[4129.32 --> 4129.84]  Nope.
[4130.10 --> 4132.26]  Because it's going to be broken or it's going to be broken.
[4132.50 --> 4138.66]  Speaking of things never changing, it's like the ISPs want us to keep having negative things to say about them.
[4138.78 --> 4138.88]  What?
[4138.98 --> 4139.08]  Oh.
[4139.08 --> 4140.94]  This is brutal.
[4141.12 --> 4141.96]  It's on the register.
[4142.46 --> 4145.62]  Guys, you have to listen to this at some point.
[4146.02 --> 4153.44]  You know what's the funny thing about it is Comcast is backpedaling and saying, oh, we're very upset that the customer was treated in this manner.
[4153.44 --> 4160.68]  This is a recording of about an eight minute customer support call where someone tried to call in and cancel their service.
[4160.78 --> 4162.56]  And they're like, oh, we're really embarrassed about this.
[4162.80 --> 4172.44]  They've said nothing about disciplining the employee because as listening to the recording, I am sure the employee was 100% doing everything right.
[4173.34 --> 4174.72]  They were probably instructed to work.
[4174.72 --> 4182.96]  They were probably instructed to work in exactly this way because the employee doesn't tell the customer, doesn't call the customer an asshole or something.
[4182.96 --> 4188.28]  Like the employee is polite, sort of, throughout the whole thing.
[4188.32 --> 4193.14]  Other than talking over the customer and repetitively asking the same stupid questions.
[4193.78 --> 4199.80]  Like, well, you know, if our service is superior and faster, are you saying that you'd like to have an inferior service?
[4200.04 --> 4203.52]  And then when the guy just tries to say, like, no, I just want to cancel the service.
[4203.68 --> 4205.16]  I don't have to answer this question.
[4205.52 --> 4205.86]  Well, what?
[4205.92 --> 4207.80]  So then you're saying you want an inferior service?
[4208.18 --> 4209.92]  Our competitor can't give you what we give you.
[4209.92 --> 4212.42]  And he kind of goes, okay, sure, I want an inferior service.
[4212.42 --> 4218.54]  And the customer service, the CSR is like, oh, well, why would you want an inferior service?
[4218.62 --> 4220.04]  I mean, let's listen to what you're saying.
[4220.22 --> 4224.64]  Like, you know, please and thank yous are all in there.
[4224.82 --> 4228.82]  But talking over the customer in this disrespectful manner is not cool.
[4229.18 --> 4229.28]  No.
[4229.92 --> 4233.66]  But that's, I'm certain, what they were instructed to do.
[4233.80 --> 4236.78]  I don't like RISPs, but I don't think it would have been that bad.
[4237.30 --> 4238.02]  They'll push you.
[4238.14 --> 4240.72]  Yeah, I've canceled service with RISPs and R-Telcos.
[4240.80 --> 4241.54]  It's nothing like that.
[4241.54 --> 4242.22]  No, no.
[4242.30 --> 4242.82]  They'll push you.
[4242.90 --> 4243.58]  They'll ask you why.
[4243.66 --> 4245.22]  But if you're like, I just don't want it.
[4245.28 --> 4245.80]  I just don't want it.
[4245.88 --> 4247.26]  They'll be like, oh, okay.
[4247.82 --> 4248.70]  Really aggressive.
[4248.92 --> 4249.60]  And they'll cancel it.
[4249.80 --> 4253.80]  And just like one of the highest pressure sales techniques that I've ever encountered.
[4254.54 --> 4255.90]  And yeah.
[4256.46 --> 4256.62]  So.
[4257.26 --> 4257.42]  Like Shaw.
[4257.54 --> 4257.70]  Okay.
[4257.80 --> 4258.58]  Shaw called me.
[4258.80 --> 4259.00]  Yeah.
[4259.08 --> 4260.02]  Because I used to have Shaw.
[4260.18 --> 4263.64]  And then where I'm living now, the landlord has internet already.
[4263.64 --> 4266.52]  So they're like, oh, you canceled Shaw.
[4266.82 --> 4267.78]  Was there like a reason?
[4267.94 --> 4268.66]  Did you not like it?
[4268.74 --> 4269.52]  Do you have too many outages?
[4269.62 --> 4269.96]  Like what?
[4270.06 --> 4271.02]  Why did you cancel Shaw?
[4271.18 --> 4273.48]  And I was like, oh, I moved somewhere and they have it already.
[4273.84 --> 4275.14]  Like, oh, so you don't want it anymore?
[4275.24 --> 4275.70]  I was like, well.
[4276.22 --> 4277.46]  I moved somewhere and I have it already.
[4277.64 --> 4278.30]  I have it already.
[4278.38 --> 4279.56]  Like I'm using it.
[4279.62 --> 4283.58]  I'm just not paying for it because the person that owns the building is already paying for it.
[4283.58 --> 4285.14]  And they're like, oh, okay.
[4285.58 --> 4286.62]  Hopefully use this in the future.
[4286.70 --> 4287.60]  I was like, yep.
[4288.00 --> 4288.32]  Okay.
[4288.32 --> 4288.58]  Bye.
[4288.94 --> 4290.60]  Like it was really not a big deal.
[4290.68 --> 4294.10]  They didn't try to push and be like, no, you have to like get your own blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4294.20 --> 4295.40]  Which I don't know.
[4295.46 --> 4295.84]  But whatever.
[4295.84 --> 4304.22]  It felt just like the worst thing about, you know, trying to shop for a car or trying to shop for insurance
[4304.22 --> 4306.04]  or like those kinds of things.
[4306.14 --> 4311.34]  It felt like I had a Primerica presentation in my kitchen when I was listening to this thing.
[4313.22 --> 4313.84]  That's brutal.
[4313.90 --> 4314.64]  Which I did recently.
[4314.98 --> 4316.46]  Long story why they were there.
[4316.80 --> 4320.74]  But I'll have to tell you offline because, yeah.
[4321.60 --> 4322.00]  Ouch.
[4322.18 --> 4323.18]  Yeah, it was really annoying.
[4323.22 --> 4324.60]  I've lost a couple of friends to that.
[4324.82 --> 4325.10]  Yeah.
[4325.66 --> 4326.66]  Not like, I don't mean.
[4326.66 --> 4327.28]  I went to a presentation.
[4328.24 --> 4329.34]  I've gone to one as well.
[4329.36 --> 4329.46]  Yeah.
[4329.46 --> 4330.96]  But I got tricked into going to one.
[4331.18 --> 4332.28]  No, I knew where I was going.
[4332.50 --> 4332.96]  I didn't.
[4332.96 --> 4333.56]  I had no idea.
[4333.56 --> 4337.74]  I had a weird idea that it might have been something to do with that, but I had no idea.
[4337.78 --> 4337.90]  Yeah.
[4337.94 --> 4340.54]  I was fresh out of high school and someone was like, blah, blah, blah.
[4340.80 --> 4341.94]  You know, there's this thing.
[4342.08 --> 4342.58]  Fresh out of high school.
[4342.70 --> 4343.06]  That sounds right.
[4343.18 --> 4350.38]  I hadn't caught on to the whole, if they refuse to tell you what you're selling, then you probably
[4350.38 --> 4351.52]  shouldn't be selling it yet.
[4352.06 --> 4353.64]  So they were just like, no, no, no.
[4353.66 --> 4354.40]  We can't tell you anything.
[4354.48 --> 4355.32]  You have to just come to the presentation.
[4355.44 --> 4356.48]  So I kind of sat through the presentation.
[4356.60 --> 4358.48]  I kind of went, okay, it's Pyraminsky.
[4358.88 --> 4360.58]  And then that was about the end of that.
[4360.58 --> 4364.48]  I had contacted a friend that I hadn't talked to since high school.
[4364.80 --> 4366.08]  And I was like, we should hang out sometime.
[4366.22 --> 4368.52]  And they were like, yeah, you should come to my work.
[4368.62 --> 4370.06]  We're having a work thing.
[4370.20 --> 4371.60]  And we're allowed to bring plus ones.
[4372.00 --> 4373.64]  We're encouraged to bring plus ones.
[4373.64 --> 4374.88]  Like, it's good.
[4374.94 --> 4375.78]  I should be bringing people.
[4375.92 --> 4378.24]  I'm like, okay, sure.
[4378.50 --> 4380.86]  And then day up, they're like, oh, yeah, like, wear something nice.
[4380.94 --> 4382.28]  Like, it's fairly formal.
[4382.46 --> 4384.04]  I was like, okay.
[4384.26 --> 4386.50]  So that's when I had that, like, one red and black suit.
[4386.58 --> 4386.98]  Do you remember that?
[4387.32 --> 4387.44]  Yes.
[4387.44 --> 4389.80]  So I put that on, which is, like, super formal.
[4389.80 --> 4390.58]  Way over the top.
[4390.58 --> 4390.94]  Oh, yeah.
[4391.04 --> 4392.32]  Like, way over the top.
[4392.36 --> 4393.48]  Because it's the only thing I have.
[4393.76 --> 4396.96]  And I show up and, like, they haven't told me what they do.
[4397.66 --> 4400.68]  And I've asked them multiple times what it's about, all this kind of stuff.
[4401.02 --> 4402.32]  And I show up.
[4402.34 --> 4403.84]  And then I'm like, oh, this is your work.
[4403.88 --> 4404.40]  This is weird.
[4404.46 --> 4406.30]  It's in, like, a storage unit complex.
[4408.50 --> 4409.66]  This is really odd.
[4409.66 --> 4414.08]  Which, ironically, isn't as bad as your old office in my house.
[4414.64 --> 4415.08]  Gosh.
[4417.40 --> 4418.32]  But, yeah.
[4418.48 --> 4422.14]  And then I sit down and I realize that it's not, like, just some work.
[4422.50 --> 4424.28]  There's the reception desk.
[4424.42 --> 4426.74]  And then there's the, like, presentation room.
[4426.96 --> 4428.24]  There's no working area.
[4428.36 --> 4429.44]  And I'm like, oh, God.
[4430.10 --> 4431.52]  I'll just sit through this and then go home.
[4431.86 --> 4432.20]  Yeah.
[4432.94 --> 4433.22]  Yeah.
[4434.24 --> 4434.60]  Okay.
[4434.74 --> 4439.80]  So SanDisk apparently is reporting that their SSD sales have soared.
[4440.36 --> 4443.22]  That alone isn't really that newsworthy.
[4443.34 --> 4444.40]  There's an article on the register.
[4444.76 --> 4446.50]  So, bloopity bloop, there's the one.
[4448.22 --> 4450.34]  That, to me, isn't the huge thing about it.
[4450.48 --> 4456.18]  But what is interesting to me about it is the way that we're finally seeing capacities take another jump.
[4456.18 --> 4465.40]  SanDisk is talking about 4TB and 2TB, like, terabyte class, multi-terabyte class SSDs that might be very, very expensive right now.
[4465.52 --> 4467.44]  But prices are continuing to fall.
[4467.60 --> 4470.84]  They're talking about how their volumes are increasing.
[4470.84 --> 4475.98]  So their actual revenues are up, even though profits are not really sort of increasing in the same manner.
[4476.12 --> 4478.12]  So we're seeing it become commoditized.
[4478.26 --> 4479.92]  We're seeing it become more affordable.
[4480.32 --> 4483.46]  So that's the whole point of this, is it's getting more affordable.
[4483.82 --> 4485.26]  It's really, really exciting.
[4486.26 --> 4495.92]  SSDs are the, maybe they're not the future, but they're at least the immediate sort of transitional phase between hard drives and whatever the future ends up being.
[4495.92 --> 4499.08]  And that's pretty much all that I have to say about that.
[4499.48 --> 4502.58]  Next big, oh, this is, this is, this really sucks.
[4502.88 --> 4503.14]  Oh.
[4503.60 --> 4508.98]  Microsoft cutting, or cut 18,000 jobs.
[4509.12 --> 4512.92]  Which is 14% of their global workforce.
[4513.20 --> 4514.16]  Holy crap.
[4514.26 --> 4516.78]  I mean, that's basically like me cutting one employee.
[4516.78 --> 4521.50]  No, not to make light of the situation.
[4521.70 --> 4523.62]  That is absolutely incredible.
[4523.84 --> 4525.00]  I mean, I understand.
[4525.40 --> 4529.48]  So this was originally posted on the forum by Jozle and the original articles from the BBC.
[4529.66 --> 4530.86]  There's a number of sources on it.
[4531.28 --> 4539.76]  I understand, you know, right sizing or streamlining or, or whatever the case may be.
[4539.76 --> 4546.02]  But I just find it interesting that they kind of shoveled a whole bunch of it under the Nokia thing.
[4546.54 --> 4549.36]  So they're like, yeah, we're getting rid of people because of the Nokia merger.
[4549.74 --> 4551.68]  Actually, a lot of other people as well.
[4551.96 --> 4552.36]  Yeah.
[4553.18 --> 4557.16]  So I guess that's really, that's really all there is to say about it.
[4557.22 --> 4560.90]  So they, they're kind of, it's 18,000 over the next year.
[4561.32 --> 4564.04]  So it's not all like everyone's job is gone.
[4564.34 --> 4566.88]  The mass majority of it's going to be over the next six months though.
[4566.88 --> 4571.32]  But it's one of those things where it's easy for us to kind of see these kinds of job cuts and go,
[4571.44 --> 4574.04]  oh, okay, well, you know, they, they did this or they did that.
[4574.10 --> 4579.36]  But it's a lot harder to look at it and go, okay, well, someone we know and like and respect lost their job.
[4579.54 --> 4582.58]  So Barnacles is one of our fellow YouTubers.
[4582.96 --> 4585.14]  This was posted by the Double Y Gamer on the forum.
[4585.34 --> 4588.68]  Just a series of tweets from him kind of going, holy cow.
[4589.22 --> 4590.88]  I got blindsided by this.
[4591.20 --> 4592.52]  Didn't expect this at all.
[4592.52 --> 4597.94]  But Barnacles was one of the, one of the casualties in Microsoft cutting all these jobs.
[4598.08 --> 4600.06]  So you should definitely check them out on YouTube.
[4600.38 --> 4603.98]  Barnacles one, numerical one on YouTube.
[4603.98 --> 4605.42]  Or if you just search for Barnacles.
[4605.78 --> 4606.82]  That should be a secondary account.
[4607.04 --> 4607.26]  Then.
[4607.42 --> 4608.78]  Barnacles numerical one.
[4609.96 --> 4610.66]  Numerical one.
[4610.76 --> 4611.02]  No.
[4611.46 --> 4613.84]  If you had a secondary account, it should be Barnacles two.
[4613.98 --> 4614.14]  Nope.
[4614.66 --> 4615.40]  That's stupid.
[4615.52 --> 4617.08]  That's the stupidest thing you've said today.
[4617.18 --> 4617.84]  Barnacles numerical one.
[4617.84 --> 4625.60]  Stupidest isn't even a word, which some people will go, no, the person calling something the stupidest thing ever is stupid because they're using not even a word.
[4625.72 --> 4630.74]  But actually, I'm saying it very intentionally to emphasize how stupid it is.
[4630.80 --> 4631.44]  It's so stupid.
[4631.54 --> 4632.40]  It shouldn't even be real.
[4633.00 --> 4633.38]  There.
[4634.38 --> 4634.82]  Done.
[4635.14 --> 4636.10]  That was very well put.
[4636.40 --> 4637.12]  I'll take that.
[4637.12 --> 4637.78]  The Millennium Bug returns.
[4638.36 --> 4640.10]  So this is, this is pretty funny.
[4640.36 --> 4641.98]  I can't believe this.
[4642.02 --> 4644.00]  Posted on the forum by Johnners.
[4644.00 --> 4645.26]  But this is, this is great.
[4645.26 --> 4660.08]  So the selective service system mistakenly sent notices to more than 14,000 Pennsylvanian men born between 1893 and 1897, ordering them to register for the nation's military draft and warning that a failure to do so is punishable by a fine and imprisonment.
[4660.82 --> 4665.56]  What they actually meant was 1993 to 1997.
[4666.22 --> 4668.60]  So Y2K strikes again.
[4668.60 --> 4671.08]  Oh, like, I can't even believe.
[4671.30 --> 4676.82]  I love how they're like, yeah, they, they accepted that it was wrong and they just told people just to ignore it if it shows up.
[4677.22 --> 4680.44]  I'm like, that's actually going to be possibly traumatic for certain people.
[4680.62 --> 4681.40]  I would think so.
[4681.48 --> 4681.74]  Yeah.
[4681.82 --> 4684.64]  Like, that's going to be not good at all.
[4684.64 --> 4696.34]  Because I, I wouldn't even be surprised if there's people in that group that possibly passed away in duty that are now getting drafted.
[4696.80 --> 4697.24]  Yeah.
[4697.40 --> 4698.18]  I mean, it's, it's.
[4698.20 --> 4700.10]  And like, their spouses might still be alive or something.
[4700.32 --> 4701.60]  It's, it's, it's super not cool.
[4701.70 --> 4707.40]  I mean, the error occurred because the state uses a two-digit code to indicate, um, to indicate the date.
[4707.40 --> 4712.88]  And digital systems go back far enough that those people were alive when this code was implemented.
[4713.06 --> 4715.86]  Like, all this stuff, I, I, I still, I don't understand.
[4715.98 --> 4719.38]  Like, I still see stuff that uses two-digit date codes.
[4719.86 --> 4722.62]  And it's like, haven't we figured out that this is a problem yet?
[4722.66 --> 4724.20]  We all just need to stop doing this.
[4724.78 --> 4725.88]  Use real dates.
[4726.14 --> 4727.94]  We have really big storage now.
[4728.34 --> 4728.74]  It's okay.
[4728.84 --> 4729.38]  It's fine.
[4729.48 --> 4729.68]  Just.
[4729.86 --> 4730.98]  The extra two characters.
[4731.22 --> 4732.22]  Just take the two more characters.
[4732.28 --> 4733.16]  Probably fine.
[4733.26 --> 4733.92]  It'll be okay.
[4733.92 --> 4744.10]  Speaking of two characters, The Last of Us have remastered on the PS4 is going to allow you to lock the frame rate at 30 FPS.
[4744.34 --> 4748.22]  Now, to be clear, by default, it will run at 1080p 60p.
[4748.22 --> 4769.64]  And I am definitely a huge advocate for consoles giving the user the option to control the graphical fidelity settings so that they can choose whether they want, you know, more particles to kick around on the floor or whether they prefer to run at a more consistent frame rate or at a higher resolution or whatever else the case may be.
[4769.64 --> 4774.90]  But the one concern that this brings up, so this was posted by Dietrich W in the forum.
[4774.98 --> 4791.94]  The one concern that this raises for me is if you're at 60 FPS and they're acknowledging that, and they're giving you the option to lock at 30 FPS because there is no cinematic gameplay reason to play a game at 30 FPS.
[4791.94 --> 4793.70]  Put that out of your mind.
[4794.08 --> 4802.98]  If they're giving us that option, are they basically saying, well, it could be dipping below 60 FPS often enough that it might bother some people to the point where they'd rather play at a lower frame rate?
[4803.38 --> 4811.08]  I rebuttal this a little bit by saying that one of the lead developers was talking about how amazing it was to play it in 60 FPS.
[4811.54 --> 4814.26]  So I don't really think it's going to be that big of an issue.
[4814.48 --> 4815.00]  It could be.
[4815.00 --> 4821.30]  But then I've always been one of those divatastic people who basically dials in my graphics settings based on worst case scenario.
[4821.64 --> 4821.74]  Yep.
[4822.22 --> 4829.16]  And people will often make this argument, well, you don't need to run your game at 95 FPS because your monitor only supports 60 FPS.
[4829.40 --> 4830.54]  It's not really the point.
[4831.00 --> 4838.44]  The point is those times when it dips are usually the times when a bunch of dudes jump out at you.
[4838.76 --> 4839.76]  That's how it works.
[4840.22 --> 4842.78]  When there's more objects on screen, that's when your frame rate dips.
[4842.78 --> 4850.36]  So that's why it's important to run at an average frame rate of 100 FPS so that when shit gets real, you're ready.
[4851.18 --> 4853.62]  And everything runs at 60 even though it never dips below.
[4853.84 --> 4857.28]  That's why in star season when you're staring at the floor, you can get like 150.
[4857.76 --> 4862.34]  And then if you look up in a deluxe hangar that has a ton of ships in it, you can go down to like 10 or 15.
[4863.04 --> 4867.12]  Like, it can be a lot harder to run different parts of different games.
[4867.20 --> 4869.36]  And G-Sync will alleviate this quite a lot.
[4869.46 --> 4870.62]  More than I expected.
[4870.62 --> 4876.32]  40 FPS looks pretty good on a G-Sync monitor when you're not dealing with any stuttering or tearing.
[4876.72 --> 4876.76]  Yeah.
[4876.86 --> 4879.74]  But, well, maybe 40 might be a little bit on the low side.
[4879.80 --> 4881.18]  45 looked pretty good though.
[4881.84 --> 4882.54]  It's still, yeah.
[4882.84 --> 4883.04]  Yeah.
[4883.34 --> 4884.06]  It's interesting.
[4884.48 --> 4886.62]  And then the...
[4887.96 --> 4889.62]  Yeah, let's not...
[4889.62 --> 4891.12]  Just no case.
[4891.66 --> 4892.30]  Did you...
[4892.30 --> 4893.68]  We rejected the Tesla Model 3?
[4893.82 --> 4894.40]  That's exciting.
[4894.50 --> 4895.76]  We talked about it last week.
[4895.88 --> 4896.34]  Oh, did we?
[4896.48 --> 4896.66]  Yeah.
[4896.66 --> 4897.96]  Yeah, but we called it the Model E.
[4898.88 --> 4900.32]  Oh, so we can talk about that name change.
[4900.32 --> 4902.36]  Yeah, so we can talk about how Elon Musk is like...
[4902.36 --> 4916.22]  So, yeah, Ford like ruined our whole plan to have the sex lineup of cars with the Model S, the Model E, and the Model X by threatening a lawsuit over the Model E naming or something.
[4916.34 --> 4917.34]  So we're calling it the 3.
[4918.52 --> 4919.68]  So it's like close enough.
[4919.70 --> 4920.50]  He is so funny.
[4920.50 --> 4923.26]  I think he found some way to still make it work or something.
[4923.52 --> 4924.04]  Where was it?
[4924.26 --> 4924.76]  Yeah, the S...
[4924.76 --> 4928.90]  Yeah, S3, which is three I's and then an X.
[4930.10 --> 4931.24]  Yeah, I don't know.
[4931.86 --> 4932.72]  What a funny guy.
[4932.82 --> 4933.96]  I mean, who does that?
[4934.76 --> 4935.78]  Because you can't...
[4935.78 --> 4941.72]  Someone that smart who's paying that much attention to everything, there's no way he didn't know that the letters weren't going to spell sex.
[4942.02 --> 4942.24]  Mm-hmm.
[4943.20 --> 4943.60]  Awesome.
[4943.86 --> 4944.04]  Guaranteed.
[4944.36 --> 4944.84]  I love it.
[4944.90 --> 4945.58]  I think he's hilarious.
[4945.88 --> 4946.20]  Me too.
[4946.38 --> 4947.36]  I like Musk a lot.
[4948.34 --> 4949.58]  He's kind of awesome.
[4949.58 --> 4952.00]  I think that's pretty much it from my side.
[4952.18 --> 4953.46]  There's other stuff, but it's just...
[4953.46 --> 4953.52]  Yeah.
[4953.78 --> 4954.14]  I don't know.
[4954.18 --> 4955.24]  None of it seems that exciting.
[4955.52 --> 4955.62]  Yeah.
[4955.70 --> 4956.58]  So...
[4956.58 --> 4960.32]  Totally not great.
[4960.46 --> 4961.60]  Totally not a drum roll.
[4961.60 --> 4961.92]  For the laptop.
[4962.86 --> 4963.28]  Oh.
[4964.10 --> 4964.68]  That's okay.
[4964.84 --> 4969.24]  The laptop that's like trying really hard to keep itself alive.
[4969.48 --> 4971.30]  I may replace this laptop.
[4971.62 --> 4972.10]  With what?
[4972.34 --> 4973.70]  Four gigs of RAM isn't enough.
[4974.26 --> 4974.92]  And you can't upgrade?
[4975.02 --> 4975.86]  I might just get a new...
[4975.86 --> 4976.06]  No.
[4976.18 --> 4976.80]  No, soldered on.
[4976.80 --> 4978.62]  I might just get a new Gen XPS 12.
[4978.62 --> 4980.72]  Speaking about soldered on...
[4980.72 --> 4981.38]  What?
[4981.54 --> 4981.84]  No.
[4982.98 --> 4984.58]  Nothing soldered onto that laptop.
[4984.86 --> 4985.74]  No, I didn't mean that.
[4985.82 --> 4986.90]  I meant the blade.
[4987.24 --> 4987.60]  The blade.
[4987.70 --> 4988.16]  That's why...
[4988.16 --> 4988.32]  Oh.
[4988.78 --> 4989.82]  That's why I'm personally...
[4989.82 --> 4991.14]  No, I already shipped the blade back.
[4991.36 --> 4991.56]  Yeah.
[4991.68 --> 4994.78]  I was tempted to just not ship it back and just be like, what are you going to do?
[4995.60 --> 4996.48]  What are they going to do?
[4996.56 --> 4998.54]  Stop seeding me review samples?
[4998.82 --> 4999.06]  No.
[4999.06 --> 5002.88]  What they could have done was they could have turned that into like an advertising campaign.
[5003.88 --> 5008.38]  It's like, our laptop is so good that this guy won't send it back.
[5008.38 --> 5015.10]  But if they publicized what I did, then they'd be opening up the floodgates for other reviewers to just not send things back.
[5016.10 --> 5018.68]  Or also they could send like the Razor SWAT crew.
[5020.12 --> 5021.38]  Not real SWAT.
[5021.38 --> 5024.84]  They could show up with like water guns and raid the house.
[5024.94 --> 5026.98]  That would actually be kind of hilarious.
[5027.82 --> 5031.58]  Except it could cause real problems because like, yeah.
[5032.46 --> 5033.82]  Yeah, that would...
[5033.82 --> 5036.42]  I mean, fake SWATing is never funny.
[5036.70 --> 5038.18]  Even if they're armed with water guns.
[5038.54 --> 5039.80]  So I would definitely see that being a problem.
[5039.80 --> 5046.16]  But if you call the head, like if they call the head and like informed the police and like it was set up and we probably knew.
[5046.24 --> 5047.78]  They would have to inform us.
[5047.94 --> 5050.22]  It would basically, the whole thing would just have to be completely staged.
[5050.24 --> 5051.26]  Everyone would have to know.
[5051.60 --> 5057.44]  It would have to be like realistic looking SWAT uniforms with like bright yellow and orange water guns.
[5058.22 --> 5059.42]  So everyone knows it's fake.
[5059.78 --> 5060.18]  Yeah.
[5060.70 --> 5062.74]  But then you're, it's not even that funny anymore.
[5062.74 --> 5063.26]  Okay, anyway.
[5063.56 --> 5065.92]  So speaking of things that aren't that funny anymore.
[5065.92 --> 5073.82]  Making you guys wait any longer for the drawing of the signed ROG G550 JK gaming notebook.
[5074.02 --> 5078.44]  So it's signed by all the Highlander video personalities that were the tops of me.
[5078.56 --> 5085.58]  Logan, Kane, Luke, Austin, Paul, and Kyle all signed to the bottom of this unit.
[5086.06 --> 5087.98]  And it can be yours.
[5088.38 --> 5089.80]  So we are going to draw it live.
[5089.98 --> 5090.72]  Random.org.
[5090.82 --> 5092.62]  So we have 611 pages.
[5093.24 --> 5094.18]  Oh, okay.
[5094.18 --> 5101.18]  Whatever we draw live here, guys, if we find that your entry wasn't valid, so we go back and make sure that your entry was valid.
[5101.38 --> 5102.54]  I'll be inspecting accounts.
[5102.68 --> 5103.82]  I'll be inspecting posts.
[5103.82 --> 5104.28]  He'll be digging.
[5104.38 --> 5107.24]  Don't tell them what you're inspecting because we don't want them to know what we're looking for.
[5107.26 --> 5107.78]  I'm not telling them how.
[5108.02 --> 5108.26]  Oh, okay.
[5108.92 --> 5110.78]  Basically, we have a process.
[5111.24 --> 5112.30]  You won't get away with it.
[5112.58 --> 5114.42]  So we may do a redraw.
[5114.58 --> 5117.56]  Stay tuned on Twitter if the original winner ends up not being valid.
[5117.70 --> 5118.58]  But here we go, guys.
[5118.66 --> 5119.00]  Drum roll.
[5119.00 --> 5124.82]  So the way that we do it is first we draw a random page on random.org.
[5124.82 --> 5129.06]  Then we draw a random poster on said random page.
[5129.14 --> 5130.92]  So I think it's 20 posts per page.
[5131.10 --> 5131.24]  Yep.
[5131.80 --> 5132.90]  20 posts per page.
[5133.26 --> 5135.24]  Here we go.
[5136.68 --> 5138.04]  Page 341.
[5138.04 --> 5138.42]  Hold up.
[5138.64 --> 5142.84]  Give everyone a little bit of time so they can figure out if they're on page 341.
[5142.96 --> 5143.40]  Sure.
[5143.48 --> 5143.90]  Okay.
[5143.90 --> 5144.92]  I have one super anxious.
[5145.60 --> 5145.92]  Okay.
[5146.00 --> 5147.94]  I'm just terrorizing everybody right now.
[5147.96 --> 5148.28]  Okay.
[5148.38 --> 5148.66]  All right.
[5148.70 --> 5149.32]  We will do that.
[5149.82 --> 5150.18]  Okay.
[5150.30 --> 5160.02]  So it could be TonyTang66, Pinnin, Fikri Farhan, Cameron Schultz, Legola Dex, Slymanski.
[5160.62 --> 5162.44]  Oh, it won't be Slymanski.
[5162.60 --> 5163.14]  No, it's Slymanski.
[5163.16 --> 5163.60]  Sorry, dude.
[5163.60 --> 5178.90]  Mr. Moshpit101, Shookalate, Rangnur, Eithlater, Shineval, Aiden Chu, Ethorn, Lightcam, Nick45101.
[5179.28 --> 5180.10]  It better not be our Nick.
[5180.16 --> 5180.68]  Yeah, seriously.
[5180.80 --> 5181.48]  I can check that.
[5182.78 --> 5186.52]  Fiktuiziklaister or Joe1134206.
[5186.52 --> 5187.80]  There is so many Joes.
[5188.52 --> 5188.74]  Yeah.
[5189.12 --> 5189.58]  So many.
[5189.72 --> 5190.10]  All the Joes.
[5190.12 --> 5191.26]  Incredible amount of Joes.
[5191.80 --> 5192.20]  Okay.
[5192.20 --> 5194.42]  So now we will go from one to 20.
[5203.30 --> 5203.66]  Nine.
[5204.44 --> 5204.82]  Okay.
[5204.92 --> 5206.08]  So let's count them.
[5206.98 --> 5212.04]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[5212.36 --> 5214.74]  Do you double count the guy that was in there twice?
[5215.22 --> 5216.24]  I guess we already picked Brick.
[5216.24 --> 5218.66]  Yeah, because we're picking a random one based on pulse count.
[5218.90 --> 5219.34]  Then we're going to validate.
[5219.34 --> 5219.94]  20 on a page.
[5220.02 --> 5220.26]  Good point.
[5220.26 --> 5220.36]  Yeah.
[5220.46 --> 5224.42]  So that way the double entries don't affect anyone else's chance to win.
[5224.46 --> 5224.60]  Yeah.
[5224.76 --> 5224.88]  Yeah.
[5225.66 --> 5226.74]  So there it is.
[5226.86 --> 5227.50]  You won.
[5228.62 --> 5229.26]  Good job.
[5230.72 --> 5231.04]  Yay.
[5231.04 --> 5234.42]  So I'll send a PM through the forum, which is how our giveaways work.
[5235.56 --> 5236.08]  All right.
[5236.18 --> 5236.56]  Congratulations, everyone.
[5236.56 --> 5238.54]  What are we going to do if that person doesn't respond?
[5238.94 --> 5239.60]  To respond to what?
[5239.88 --> 5240.64]  The PM on the forum.
[5242.22 --> 5243.10]  Then we'll redraw it.
[5243.26 --> 5243.46]  Okay.
[5243.62 --> 5243.80]  Yeah.
[5244.06 --> 5244.26]  Okay.
[5244.60 --> 5245.40]  So stay tuned on Twitter.
[5245.54 --> 5247.14]  I was more asking for like...
[5247.14 --> 5249.52]  I can't believe how many people are watching WAN show today.
[5249.62 --> 5250.54]  Thank you so much, guys.
[5250.64 --> 5252.64]  We peaked near 6,000.
[5252.78 --> 5252.90]  Yeah.
[5252.94 --> 5253.58]  We broke a record.
[5253.68 --> 5255.02]  Our last record was about 5,500.
[5255.42 --> 5255.76]  Wow.
[5255.88 --> 5256.60]  You guys are incredible.
[5256.82 --> 5257.94]  Thank you so much for watching.
[5258.38 --> 5260.26]  I think that's pretty much it for the show.
[5260.64 --> 5266.32]  For those of you upset that it's someone who only posted once, the giveaway is for Linus
[5266.32 --> 5267.90]  Tech Tips YouTube viewers.
[5268.62 --> 5272.64]  We are using the forum as a mechanism for hosting the giveaway.
[5273.38 --> 5280.90]  Someone who has one post on the forum could be a long-time loyal viewer of our videos.
[5281.04 --> 5283.74]  Even a big commenter on the YouTube instead of on Facebook.
[5284.12 --> 5284.30]  Yeah.
[5284.68 --> 5289.70]  So just because they don't post a lot on linustechtips.com doesn't mean they're not a member of our community.
[5289.98 --> 5292.14]  So let's try not to be all butthurt about that.
[5292.14 --> 5297.62]  And if they're not logging on to the community that much, you have a higher chance that they won't answer the PM and that there's going to be a redraw.
[5297.62 --> 5298.28]  That's right.
[5298.56 --> 5299.68]  So we did think of this.
[5300.26 --> 5300.66]  All right.
[5300.82 --> 5301.42]  Peace out, guys.
[5301.52 --> 5302.10]  Thanks for watching.
[5302.18 --> 5302.80]  And we'll see you again.
[5302.92 --> 5304.62]  Same bat time, same bat channel next week.
[5304.78 --> 5305.46]  Bye, everyone.
[5308.58 --> 5309.68]  Why is that still there?
[5310.40 --> 5311.06]  There we go.
[5319.30 --> 5320.40]  Yeah, someone's comment.

[5334.52 --> 5338.40]  For us to make the assumption that they're all just watching this would be...
