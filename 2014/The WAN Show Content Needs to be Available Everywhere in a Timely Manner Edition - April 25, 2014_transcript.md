[0.00 --> 6.94]  A feeling where you're about to go live and broadcast to like thousands of people but like you're missing something something's not quite right
[6.94 --> 9.24]  Like every single time we host the WAN show
[12.18 --> 18.50]  Yeah, okay, I guess that that could be there's like there's there's always the okay something's probably wrong
[20.12 --> 24.62]  No, we did a pre-show today. There's nothing wrong. Everything is fine
[26.10 --> 28.54]  Right now we didn't test any of the scenes
[28.54 --> 33.46]  Uh, that's okay. Most of them are the same and test your laptop
[33.46 --> 38.92]  Um, no, we tested the laptop. Oh, we did yeah. Okay. Yeah. I tested it while you weren't looking boom
[38.92 --> 42.10]  I test all kinds of things while you're not looking. That's awkward
[42.10 --> 44.92]  Do you test poll results while I'm not looking?
[45.54 --> 50.02]  Poll results. No, we're not gonna get into that yet. I have a whole I have a whole thing
[50.02 --> 55.38]  I have a whole thing on that speaking of a whole thing on stuff
[55.38 --> 60.30]  Um, hold on a second so the
[61.02 --> 70.44]  WAN show soundcloud I'm gonna try and find it but we actually have a WAN show podcast feed now so
[70.68 --> 78.94]  Tera Teren set it up and I don't know where the email is about it and apparently you can't just google podcast
[78.94 --> 84.78]  Hey, uh Teren can you send me the link to the soundcloud thing so I can share it with the peeps?
[86.86 --> 87.86]  Thank you
[87.86 --> 91.20]  Soundcloud.com slash the WAN show. Oh, we got it
[93.34 --> 94.74]  Yep
[94.74 --> 101.22]  Okay, so guys, it's soundcloud.com slash the WAN show. I don't think we are quite
[101.22 --> 106.86]  caught up yet because we don't really have like a smooth procedure for
[107.86 --> 114.62]  Taking the video feed which is a stupid FLV file with the desynced audio and the bleh all that kind of stuff
[114.70 --> 119.86]  But there you go guys all the entire history of the WAN show has been
[119.86 --> 127.78]  Almost almost almost has been archived on soundcloud you can download it as a podcast listen to it in the car or
[128.10 --> 134.46]  Wherever else people listen to podcasts. I've never been much of a podcast listener myself, but even almost this isn't into 2014 yet
[135.10 --> 139.78]  Oh, October 11th. Well, hold on a second. Are you sure it's not just like later on?
[140.26 --> 145.62]  Or something I look down there and went further back August 2013 July 2013
[145.62 --> 151.16]  Well, whatever guys we'll get this we'll get this all caught up for you and everything will be all good and fine and dandy so
[151.84 --> 155.78]  All right, let's get into our first real topic shall we oh no
[155.78 --> 165.46]  We have to do our introductory topics which unfortunately these guys already saw which is a real shame because we accidentally streamed while we were creating our YouTube intro instead of
[167.30 --> 173.00]  Recording that locally and then uploading it so why don't we pick different highlights for the folks here right now
[173.00 --> 178.14]  Asus has demonstrated a V Ram defroster feature
[178.14 --> 184.30]  So you're actually gonna have a separate plug on your graphics card dedicated to heating up your memory
[185.30 --> 188.88]  Which sounds bad, but it actually makes sense. Yeah, we'll explain that later
[188.88 --> 195.26]  Also Intel has a new Thunderbolt controller that they are working on that should be able to derive two
[195.92 --> 199.24]  4k displays off of a single connector
[199.24 --> 204.00]  I should be wearing my holy balls shirt not my professional on boxer shirt because that's a big deal
[204.00 --> 205.38]  It is actually what else we got
[205.38 --> 211.80]  Google is is gonna be ending forcing Google plus integration towards everyone and there's more details on that later
[211.92 --> 218.42]  Yeah, that's huge and then Facebook has actually finally been approved to actually buy oculus
[218.42 --> 224.24]  So yeah, that'll be a short topic, but we'll talk about that later. All right, so without further ado intro time
[224.24 --> 226.24]  I really hope there's music. I didn't test it
[226.24 --> 231.00]  All right, there's music
[231.00 --> 235.00]  I
[235.00 --> 242.40]  Know I thought there was a poll about whether there's music or whether I'd have to sing
[242.40 --> 249.16]  This is what happens when people let me see the polls head time
[249.16 --> 251.16]  So never show me your poll
[251.16 --> 257.16]  All right, so hotspot shield is one of our sponsors today hotspot shield is the fast easy and expensive way to set up a VPN
[257.16 --> 259.92]  You can access content that's outside of your region
[259.92 --> 263.92]  You can browse more privately and all that great stuff also sponsoring the show today
[263.92 --> 268.68]  Actually our title sponsors you can see powered by sus g7 50 jz
[268.68 --> 273.44]  jay-z is asus with the as you may or may not have guessed
[273.44 --> 278.20]  G7 50 jay-z gaming laptop so gangster of all laptops this
[278.20 --> 280.78]  Yeah, yeah, well it kind of it kind of went that way
[280.78 --> 282.20]  I'm not gonna drop the jay-z thing
[282.20 --> 283.20]  Just jay-z
[283.20 --> 287.96]  You're gonna keep me you know, what's even funny is I conceded I made your joke
[287.96 --> 291.96]  I made your joke in the video thumbnail of the actual review of the laptop
[291.96 --> 292.96]  I saw that
[292.96 --> 296.60]  And I figured that would get you to stop making the joke
[296.60 --> 296.96]  Nope
[296.96 --> 302.84]  The joke isn't played out for you. The joke is just gonna carry on until eternity. All right. Well, that's probably it
[302.84 --> 305.70]  That's fine. That makes me very very pleased
[305.70 --> 309.40]  So, uh, thank you asus and hotspot shield for sponsoring the show today
[309.40 --> 313.54]  Let's get things going get into our first topic here. What should we get started with?
[313.54 --> 314.60]  Why don't we start at the top?
[314.60 --> 318.34]  Let's start at the top and work our way to the bottom if you know what I mean
[318.34 --> 320.48]  I didn't need it if you know what I mean
[320.48 --> 321.84]  I was fine
[321.84 --> 323.44]  If you know what I mean
[323.44 --> 325.60]  You're all fine
[325.60 --> 326.94]  Oh man
[326.94 --> 330.10]  Hitting on the entire audience one step at a time
[330.10 --> 336.58]  So okay guys, we've got a fantastic topic here. This was posted by Kakao Day G
[336.58 --> 337.38]  DJ
[337.38 --> 341.62]  Day G, whatever it happens to be. What is that? Oh, I see it. No, no, it's okay
[341.62 --> 344.42]  This needs to be removed. There we go
[344.42 --> 345.22]  Um
[345.22 --> 350.34]  So this is an asus rog article that
[350.34 --> 351.78]  What are you doing?
[352.24 --> 355.46]  I'm modding certain people. Don't worry about it. Keep going. Oh, okay
[355.46 --> 357.12]  You can mod people
[357.12 --> 359.72]  I've heard of computer modding
[359.72 --> 361.72]  And car modding
[361.72 --> 364.20]  Well, there's body mods, right?
[364.20 --> 365.00]  Body mods
[365.00 --> 367.00]  Yeah, like tattoos and piercing
[367.00 --> 369.48]  Do you have any? No. I guess I would have known
[369.48 --> 371.48]  You actually probably would have at this point
[371.48 --> 383.48]  So there's an article on asus rog that outlines why a graphics card could ever want a separate heater module for the memory
[383.48 --> 385.48]  So this is called their matrix memory defroster
[385.48 --> 387.48]  matrix memory defroster
[387.48 --> 389.48]  And if you look at the page you're supporting
[389.48 --> 391.48]  I don't care. I don't care
[391.48 --> 393.48]  Go away internet explorer
[393.48 --> 399.48]  Okay, so it shows you a graphics card that's being cooled by presumably liquid nitrogen or
[399.48 --> 401.48]  Okay, looks like liquid nitrogen since there's a
[401.48 --> 403.96]  A canister here so being cooled by liquid nitrogen
[403.96 --> 410.04]  And it shows how this frost can accumulate on the back of the card now
[410.44 --> 416.44]  Memory can suffer from certain issues like cold bugs in much the same way that processors can
[416.44 --> 422.04]  So what this does is it actually keeps the memory at a temperature that isn't
[422.04 --> 427.64]  So cold that it bugs out, but it's still cold enough that you're going to get better overclocking out of it
[427.64 --> 432.20]  And it's just one less thing for pro overclockers to worry about
[432.20 --> 437.08]  I think my comment on this back when I first saw it is probably, you know
[437.56 --> 442.12]  About as as right as anything could ever be just like anything I say. I'm just kidding
[442.12 --> 444.28]  I can be wrong about all kinds of things in fact
[444.28 --> 451.00]  I was wrong about something on the show last week and I I owe an apology to someone that I was wrong about something about
[451.00 --> 452.44]  Um
[452.44 --> 457.80]  GPU versus CPU actual total thermal output. I was going based on temperature
[458.28 --> 462.68]  Not based on the actual thermal output. So GPUs I have been informed although
[463.08 --> 466.76]  We're probably going to just test it at some point even though I I believe them
[467.00 --> 473.40]  I believe them so GPUs just have lower thermal density, which means their temperatures are lower even though the thermal output is actually quite high
[473.96 --> 475.24]  So there you have it
[475.24 --> 479.00]  I can be wrong about things and I don't even remember what I'm talking about anymore
[479.00 --> 481.96]  Right, so the comment I made at the time was okay
[482.28 --> 489.08]  So asus has developed a feature for their rog class cards that is going to have probably
[489.64 --> 493.48]  Thousands of people who know what it is and what it does and and why it exists
[493.48 --> 494.44]  It's going to have
[494.44 --> 501.32]  Maybe a hundreds of people who care and then it's going to have maybe dozens of people who are actually going to use it
[501.32 --> 503.88]  But you know what if you you know
[505.24 --> 510.36]  It's easy to just throw up your hands and say okay, it's impossible to innovate on graphics cards
[511.08 --> 518.60]  It's hard to keep trying to find ways to push the envelope and without you know guys like asus building in features like this
[518.60 --> 524.92]  We wouldn't have things like built-in voltage checkpoints to actually monitor the voltage of your GPU
[524.92 --> 531.24]  Something that is a very cool diagnostic tool when you're overclocking and like very useful even if you're not doing LN2 cooling
[531.32 --> 535.32]  You can buy a multimeter for like 20 bucks at Canadian tire if you're Canadian
[535.88 --> 537.88]  Um or wherever you buy those things
[537.88 --> 539.88]  American tire
[539.88 --> 541.88]  Walmart
[541.88 --> 543.88]  Walmart
[543.88 --> 549.88]  So you can buy a multimeter on the cheap and then it can really help you diagnose whether that voltage slider is actually doing anything
[550.44 --> 553.64]  Whether your card over volts or under volts all this stuff's really great
[553.64 --> 557.32]  So without these kinds of innovations that might seem useless one by one
[557.64 --> 560.36]  We wouldn't have the great graphics cards that we have today
[560.44 --> 563.96]  So kudos to asus for thinking outside the box on this one
[564.52 --> 567.40]  And I guess that's all I pretty much have to say about that
[567.40 --> 570.52]  What's our next topic because I'm trying to do a thing here?
[571.72 --> 574.92]  Uh, sorry. I was also trying to do a thing. I will find our next topic though
[574.92 --> 579.88]  The next topic is supreme court decides on the future of tv featuring aereo
[580.28 --> 583.64]  Oh, this is this is cray cray
[583.64 --> 584.84]  Is it aereo or aero?
[585.40 --> 586.44]  Aereo I would guess
[586.44 --> 587.16]  Aereo sure okay
[587.16 --> 591.56]  All right, so this is actually probably the biggest topic of the day
[591.56 --> 595.24]  So the way that aereo works is
[596.76 --> 598.12]  By okay by
[598.92 --> 601.72]  It all depends on how you word it
[601.72 --> 604.20]  So original article here is from washingtonpost.com
[604.20 --> 609.48]  Although there was another one that was actually quite helpful when I was when I was reading up on this
[609.48 --> 611.32]  Yeah from the guardian and there was another one
[611.32 --> 616.92]  I was reading and another one I was reading that I mean the information about this is hard to find
[616.92 --> 623.08]  From an unbiased source because this is a topic that is extremely polarizing
[623.08 --> 625.32]  So let's start with how aereo works
[625.80 --> 628.84]  What it does is it takes ota tv signals
[628.84 --> 633.64]  So these are just broadcast tv signals that anyone with you know
[634.44 --> 639.16]  A duck a hamster a piece of toast and most importantly an antenna and a television
[639.72 --> 641.32]  Especially those last two yeah
[641.32 --> 647.56]  And then anyone with an antenna and a television can tune into these signals and watch tv
[647.56 --> 649.88]  So all the tv that I had when I was a kid
[649.88 --> 656.76]  Yes, so over the air television what aereo does is it takes over the air television lets you subscribe
[658.44 --> 662.68]  Rent an antenna in their array of antennas
[663.48 --> 666.44]  Rent because it's not subscription. They don't look it
[666.44 --> 671.88]  So they let you rent an antenna in their antenna array rent cloud storage space
[672.28 --> 680.52]  And then it allows you to tune in to ota broadcasts through your internet connection and even use their
[681.96 --> 689.80]  Their rentable storage space as a pvr or dvr whatever video recorder without with a p with a d I don't care
[690.44 --> 692.04]  so
[692.12 --> 693.32]  What the okay?
[693.32 --> 699.16]  So the issue here it's hard to not it's hard to not say things that are worded as if they come off negatively or positively
[700.12 --> 700.36]  Yeah
[702.28 --> 712.20]  So the issue is that other broadcasters are alleging that aereo is no different from cable and satellite firms that are required to pay fees
[712.36 --> 722.36]  To rebroadcast their shows what aereo is arguing is that a private broadcast and this this is like 40 year old rulings that they're going back to here
[722.36 --> 724.36]  That a private
[724.36 --> 730.04]  Broadcast is not the same as a public broadcast and because it's an individual user
[730.68 --> 738.68]  Accessing content that they would have otherwise had if they just got an antenna and hooked up a dvr like they're not doing anything
[738.68 --> 740.68]  They couldn't have otherwise done
[740.68 --> 742.84]  There is so it's a private broadcast
[743.24 --> 748.84]  So I don't remember if that sentence made any sense. You know what guys I have slept so little this week like even less than usual
[748.84 --> 750.84]  And this topic is very
[750.84 --> 757.56]  Convoluted and awkward and and the topic is convoluted whereas what the broadcasters are saying is that aereo is taking
[757.80 --> 759.80]  copyrighted material and
[759.80 --> 762.12]  profiting off of it without paying
[762.92 --> 768.12]  Anyone any fees so they're just taking money and profiting off of it and then
[768.92 --> 773.16]  Advocacy groups for the other side are saying well hold on just a minute. Why should they be paying for it?
[773.16 --> 775.16]  Anyway, there's already commercials on it
[775.72 --> 779.64]  So you guys so sorry start firing back at the broadcasters
[779.64 --> 786.36]  You guys are just trying to maintain your whole double dipping business model and squash a potential competitor
[786.68 --> 793.72]  Who really all they're doing is enabling consumers to use the technology or to use the content that is already there?
[794.68 --> 799.16]  Use the technology they have to access content that is already there and already accessible to them
[799.16 --> 805.64]  One thing that was missing from both this washington post article and the other one that we're referring to here
[805.64 --> 809.08]  Was actually posted by a commenter on one of the other articles?
[809.08 --> 814.76]  I was reading about this who said well hold on a second something people are kind of missing here is that aereo only
[815.32 --> 818.68]  Allows you to subscribe within your own catchment area
[819.24 --> 822.44]  So you you actually can't subscribe to aereo in
[823.00 --> 826.44]  You know, new york if you're in florida for example
[826.44 --> 832.92]  You you have to subscribe and like anything there are yeah workarounds and actually that's another big thing is uh
[833.08 --> 834.20]  Is that even on the dock?
[834.20 --> 835.72]  I think it is
[835.72 --> 840.52]  That hulu is shutting down yeah users if it's not just throw a note in there
[840.92 --> 842.36]  We'll make sure we talk about that later
[842.36 --> 844.52]  But there are of course ways to circumvent it
[844.76 --> 851.24]  But the way that it's supposed to work is just as a way for you to access the ota content
[851.24 --> 857.48]  Without subscribing to an expensive cable package that contains a lot of stuff that you likely don't care about
[859.00 --> 859.56]  so
[859.56 --> 861.24]  I
[861.24 --> 866.84]  See both sides of this one so that was the whole me struggling through the the explanation of what's going on
[866.84 --> 868.12]  I hope you guys kind of get it
[868.12 --> 873.08]  Let me know if you don't post in the twitch chat if if it doesn't if what I said didn't make any sense
[873.72 --> 877.48]  But i'll give sort of my two cents on both sides of this on the one hand
[878.12 --> 884.20]  If you're creating premium content and someone is profiting off of the distribution of it
[884.92 --> 893.88]  They are effectively undercutting the distribution partners who are paying you and I can understand why you're going after someone who's pursuing that model
[894.28 --> 896.36]  one of the justices that's um
[897.32 --> 904.12]  I don't think they're actually going to be involved in the case, but one of the one of the us justices that has commented on the situation
[904.60 --> 911.40]  Said that looking through aria's business model they seem to be it seems to be structured entirely
[911.72 --> 914.44]  to circumvent the existing laws and
[915.56 --> 922.76]  That the actual the essence of what they're doing is just flat-out right wrong and i'm paraphrasing a little bit here because i can't find the quote right now
[923.32 --> 925.48]  But i don't necessarily
[926.28 --> 928.28]  I see it from aria's side as well
[928.68 --> 935.56]  Because what they're doing is just allowing people to use 21st century technology that they have
[935.80 --> 941.80]  And i mean quite frankly you're you're already going to be helping out your local cable provider by paying for an internet subscription
[942.20 --> 949.08]  Anyway, so they're using technology that we have to just do something that already exists and do it a little bit better
[949.08 --> 956.36]  One interesting thing that someone has brought up is that you can rig this up yourself
[956.92 --> 964.04]  Yes, and that's that's the whole defense here for aria is that this is something you can do yourself
[964.92 --> 969.64]  Yeah, it's just that they're making it accessible and they're charging people a convenience fee
[969.64 --> 977.80]  Yeah, now if they were if what they were doing was they were tuning into ota and then they were um
[978.84 --> 980.84]  and then they were like
[981.96 --> 984.68]  re-transmitting it over the the airwaves or if they had
[985.08 --> 986.20]  um a site
[986.20 --> 991.56]  I guess that you that you went on to and then anyone like a site like twitch.tv, okay?
[991.56 --> 998.84]  Where anyone can tune into their rebroadcast that would be a public rebroadcast, but the way that it's structured is
[999.48 --> 1003.80]  That antenna you're you're renting it you're leasing it you're you're whatever
[1003.80 --> 1007.00]  I guess if you really wanted to you could buy an antenna, but then you'd just be doing it yourself
[1007.00 --> 1011.96]  But like instead of buying it you are renting it and that antenna is just for you
[1012.84 --> 1015.48]  So they're not rebroadcasting it publicly
[1016.84 --> 1018.12]  I think they're gonna lose
[1018.12 --> 1020.60]  I think so too, but it's a really interesting argument
[1020.60 --> 1022.36]  I think they're gonna lose
[1022.36 --> 1026.44]  But I think at the end of the day this is just gonna be whack-a-mole
[1027.08 --> 1028.04]  where
[1028.04 --> 1030.12]  someone else will find a
[1030.76 --> 1032.76]  similar loophole and
[1032.92 --> 1039.96]  The conventional media guys are just going to have to keep knocking these little guys down one at a time
[1040.76 --> 1045.16]  And something will get through I mean the thing here is that ario has sorry
[1047.24 --> 1048.20]  Ario yeah, sorry
[1048.20 --> 1049.96]  I'm really tired
[1049.96 --> 1054.68]  Ario has already won a couple of cases in lower courts
[1054.68 --> 1059.56]  This is the first time it's going to the supreme court. They've already won a couple they lost one. They lost the most recent one
[1060.12 --> 1061.48]  so
[1061.48 --> 1066.44]  This really could go either way and I think according to the letter of the law
[1066.92 --> 1068.92]  Ario is probably right
[1068.92 --> 1074.92]  Currently yes, but like what i've been reading on some of what the justices have been saying is they might need to kind of fix things
[1074.92 --> 1077.24]  So this can't happen because when they wrote that law
[1077.24 --> 1078.36]  It was a long time ago
[1078.36 --> 1082.36]  It was a long time ago and they didn't expect stuff like this to be able to happen
[1083.16 --> 1088.52]  So now that it can happen maybe the laws have to change which is annoying to preempt to like
[1088.92 --> 1094.20]  After the fact change a law. I hate doing that with things like the coc on the forum and stuff because it's really annoying
[1094.36 --> 1097.64]  But but the thing about it is that laws need to adapt
[1098.20 --> 1103.64]  I mean, how would you make a law about cybercrime 50 years ago when it doesn't when it doesn't exist?
[1103.64 --> 1107.24]  Yeah, you know how so I I totally
[1108.84 --> 1111.64]  understand the issue here because
[1113.64 --> 1120.20]  The entire business model of creating this content is based on getting kickbacks from the distributors of the content
[1120.84 --> 1126.60]  I understand that but on the other hand, I understand the argument that that system is
[1127.40 --> 1132.68]  Fundamentally broken right now and something needs to shake it up. I don't know if a real is going to be the thing that shakes it up
[1133.24 --> 1137.00]  but what I do know is that something will have to shake it up because
[1138.04 --> 1141.24]  It's a problem. I mean it's gotten to the point where I
[1142.68 --> 1145.48]  Will not pay to watch a hockey game
[1146.20 --> 1149.40]  Because for me to pay to watch a hockey game and I just don't watch them
[1149.64 --> 1153.48]  That's that's the solution for me because for me to pay to watch a hockey game
[1153.56 --> 1157.80]  I have to buy a cable tv subscription that includes a bunch of crap. I don't care about
[1159.32 --> 1161.56]  And I have to pay a whole whack ton of money for it
[1161.56 --> 1164.60]  And I'm kind of sitting here going no, I refuse I won't do it
[1165.16 --> 1169.48]  For big events like uh, the super bowl and all that kind of stuff
[1169.72 --> 1173.00]  We we just we all my friends pack up because we all don't have
[1173.96 --> 1176.36]  Cable tv none of us and we all go to my parents
[1176.60 --> 1178.84]  Well, it's funny because everyone talks about cord cutters
[1179.32 --> 1183.16]  But there's a whole other the like the entire the group of people my age are
[1183.16 --> 1189.96]  I heard the term cord nevers and I really liked it because the only time I've ever had a cable tv subscription that I've
[1190.36 --> 1194.84]  Well, I was gonna say that I have paid for was when they gave me a free trial with my internet
[1194.84 --> 1197.64]  That I didn't pay for and then canceled as soon as I had to pay for it
[1197.64 --> 1199.64]  I never even took the free trial
[1199.64 --> 1201.80]  It was kind of handy. I don't even want it was playoffs
[1202.36 --> 1205.48]  That makes sense. I took the free trial and I was like, oh, that's great
[1205.80 --> 1208.52]  By the time this is over. I don't have any hockey to watch anyway
[1209.08 --> 1209.80]  Yeah, exactly
[1210.04 --> 1214.60]  My thing was I was scared because I just assumed that after the free trial it was just gonna start billing me
[1214.60 --> 1215.32]  Yeah, it does
[1215.32 --> 1217.80]  Yeah, and I was going to school at the time and I was like, I'm gonna forget about this
[1217.80 --> 1220.28]  And I'm gonna get a bill and I'm not gonna be able to afford it. It's gonna be bad
[1220.28 --> 1224.44]  Now I just I just set up a google calendar reminder and then I just I the the shaw
[1225.00 --> 1230.52]  Office is actually between mine and my in-laws house, so I just grabbed the box dropped it off there. I'm like, yeah, we're done
[1231.88 --> 1233.16]  Like do you still want your internet? Yeah
[1233.16 --> 1235.40]  Yeah, I'm good with the internet
[1235.40 --> 1236.76]  Thanks for the trial though
[1236.76 --> 1243.24]  So I mean for me the fundamental problem here is that the is that the the providers the cable providers in particular can't
[1243.80 --> 1252.52]  Decide how they want this to work, okay when it comes to tv they want us to pay for a large all-you-can-eat packages and
[1254.04 --> 1257.08]  Then just give us whatever we whatever we could possibly want
[1257.80 --> 1262.60]  And then when it comes to cell phone and internet by the way in canada anyway
[1262.60 --> 1269.00]  And I know in a lot of places there's a lot of overlap between tv cell phone and internet so so when it comes to cell phone and internet
[1269.48 --> 1270.68]  Oh, well hold on a second
[1270.68 --> 1273.40]  We want more of a pay-as-you-go type model here
[1273.40 --> 1277.64]  And you you pay for the things you use and I'm kind of sitting here going okay, you know what?
[1278.28 --> 1282.92]  I get it either way okay, you want it you want to package things you want to have a flat rate
[1283.40 --> 1285.48]  Sort of fee okay, I get it
[1285.80 --> 1289.56]  I won't I'm not going to subscribe because I don't care about that stuff, but I understand your point
[1290.04 --> 1297.72]  Okay, you want me to pay per usage because there's a certain amount of congestion on a network or whatever else you want to minimize that
[1297.72 --> 1303.80]  I get that but you got to make up your mind you can't be like oh well when it suits us you can pay as you go
[1303.80 --> 1309.80]  And when it doesn't suit us then we want you to take the whole the whole thing you got to give me options here because
[1310.44 --> 1317.24]  That just that does not that does not fly for me because I would have no problem paying for tv if I could say okay
[1317.24 --> 1320.12]  I want sportsnet tsn and
[1321.64 --> 1324.28]  Like I don't know cartoon network
[1324.28 --> 1326.28]  It's like it I
[1327.00 --> 1331.40]  Remember when when my parents were actually somewhat interested in getting a cable connection way back in the day
[1331.64 --> 1335.24]  We went through the show catalog, and I was like I want that one and
[1336.68 --> 1339.24]  Maybe that one and then I'm done. Yeah
[1339.96 --> 1344.68]  So I don't care about like any of that and my dad my brother and I had overlaps on all of those
[1345.00 --> 1348.28]  And then that was about it right and you guys never did end up getting one
[1348.28 --> 1353.00]  Did you I think we had one while my grandpa was here, and then I think it was gone right very shortly after
[1355.16 --> 1358.28]  And then that's about it all right, so why don't we talk about your back door here?
[1359.00 --> 1363.32]  Oh, wow, it's not my back door. Well, it's a back door. It's many people's back doors all right
[1364.60 --> 1366.60]  Because that makes it better
[1367.32 --> 1367.80]  um
[1367.80 --> 1372.28]  A security researcher has found that there was a back door a dsl routers that was found a little while ago
[1372.28 --> 1376.68]  I think like a month ago or something and then there was a patch you should talk about what the back door does
[1377.00 --> 1381.56]  So the back door allows you to I was getting into that after the patch and then the cover up
[1381.56 --> 1387.48]  And then I was going to tell people what that was so essentially there was there was then a patch which fixed the problem
[1387.88 --> 1393.24]  The same guy then found that the patch was just kind of a cover-up and it couldn't be removed very easily
[1393.24 --> 1400.52]  So what it does is allows you administrative access to the router so all administrative controls you can control so gg router
[1401.16 --> 1405.32]  You can flash lights you can do you can see packets you can do all that kind of stuff
[1405.32 --> 1411.40]  It's pretty aggressive the way that the secret is removed is just literally by sending a knock that knock though
[1411.40 --> 1418.04]  Is in an ethernet packet so like a raw data ethernet packet so it can only be sent from inside the network or from an isp
[1418.52 --> 1421.32]  So this scares people because of NSA's level stuff
[1423.32 --> 1426.44]  It's on 25 route 24 models of different routers
[1426.44 --> 1433.08]  It has been found on so far ranging from I believe like linksys and cisco so both levels there and
[1433.08 --> 1443.96]  Netgear different routers, but then this is one guy so I fully expect it could be more than that because the problem is actually based around a piece of firmware that they all share
[1446.20 --> 1447.16]  Yeah, it gives it
[1447.72 --> 1451.08]  It gives them root shell access for people that knows what that really means
[1451.32 --> 1455.40]  So this is kind of scary just because everything in this form is scary right now
[1456.12 --> 1459.64]  Because of like what the NSA was doing. What were they up to last week right heart bleed?
[1459.64 --> 1464.04]  So it's just like every single week. It's just like one more terrible thing
[1464.84 --> 1470.44]  Um, oh, I forgot diamond diamond is also another brand that's having problem with them as well
[1471.56 --> 1473.16]  That's actually pretty much it
[1474.60 --> 1480.44]  So there you go guys. We don't have a solution for you or anything no because it has to be fixed
[1480.92 --> 1485.96]  Unless someone's gonna make their own firmware, but I don't even know if these routers are susceptible to that
[1485.96 --> 1491.40]  Um, it's it's it's not gonna be fixed because they obviously don't want to if they just made a cover-up
[1492.04 --> 1494.60]  Um, so yeah, I guess I guess we'll see where this goes
[1494.60 --> 1499.48]  But all we can really do is just pay attention and hope that it goes away and check to see if your router is on that list
[1500.52 --> 1502.92]  So you know if you have to change something does it sound bad?
[1502.92 --> 1504.92]  You're a little quiet. Okay
[1504.92 --> 1508.44]  People are people are asking for you to be louder. Oh, the mic's in the shot now
[1508.44 --> 1512.04]  If you it's it's uh, the source was from Aris technica
[1512.04 --> 1515.88]  So if you want to see those routers and other stuff go to the Aris technica article
[1516.20 --> 1519.56]  Easter egg dsl router patch merely hides backdoor instead of closing it
[1519.80 --> 1523.96]  You'll find that article and then you can find other stuff out see if your router is a problem or not
[1524.44 --> 1527.40]  Absolutely fantastic. So speaking of things that are absolutely fantastic
[1528.84 --> 1534.20]  Assumptions about the one plus one very few people have actually had their hands on this
[1534.20 --> 1536.20]  incredibly
[1537.24 --> 1540.68]  Confusingly named phone. I mean what the heck?
[1540.68 --> 1543.88]  so the company is one plus
[1544.84 --> 1551.40]  And then the phone is called the one and it absolutely baffles me as much as I as I hate to see
[1551.96 --> 1555.96]  Needless lawsuits between companies like I just it drives me crazy
[1555.96 --> 1558.28]  It baffles me that they can get away with this
[1558.84 --> 1561.96]  Did is is HTC's the one or is just one?
[1561.96 --> 1565.88]  It's just one. It's the HTC one. Can we stop naming things one?
[1566.52 --> 1571.08]  Like they named their entire even company one plus. Yeah, so like
[1572.36 --> 1576.76]  And anyway anyway, so specs have been revealed. Can we nickname it the two?
[1577.64 --> 1580.12]  No, because I already call my HTC one m8 the two
[1581.08 --> 1583.08]  But this is one plus one
[1586.92 --> 1588.92]  Breathing intensifies
[1588.92 --> 1591.48]  You're freaking me out here. I don't know what to do anyway
[1591.72 --> 1593.64]  So it's going to arrive in mid-may right now
[1593.80 --> 1600.20]  You actually can't pre-order it in the same way that you could pre-order a normal phone and they're doing a weird invite based system
[1600.20 --> 1604.12]  But the full specs are out there. It uses a qualcomm snapdragon 801
[1604.44 --> 1611.96]  It's got four crate 400 cores. They're clocked at 2.5 gigahertz making it the fastest phone on the market
[1611.96 --> 1617.80]  It uses an adreno 330 gpu. It's got a 1920 by 1080 screen. It's a five and a half inch screen
[1617.80 --> 1619.48]  So this is quite a large phone. Yep
[1619.72 --> 1623.08]  Like coming in on phablet territory there. It's got
[1624.12 --> 1626.92]  401 pixels per inch in terms of its pixel density
[1626.92 --> 1633.08]  It's got a five megapixel front camera with a 13 megapixel rear camera. It's available in 16 gig or 64 gig
[1633.80 --> 1636.28]  configurations they've all got three gigs of RAM and
[1636.28 --> 1644.52]  It's $299 for the 16 gig and a mere $349 for a 64 gig phone
[1645.56 --> 1650.76]  Very cool. Yeah, that's a big deal because I've been upset about this for a long time
[1651.24 --> 1659.48]  How much cheaper flash storage has gotten and yet how we're stuck with the same price points on these phones with the same capacity
[1659.48 --> 1663.80]  As like four years ago and like this is fantastic
[1663.80 --> 1667.96]  But that price jump of 50 bucks is they're still making money off that
[1668.68 --> 1673.32]  Which is like that's still fantastic though. I'm I'm happy to pay that compared to other phones
[1673.32 --> 1676.04]  Where it's like you get eight more gigabytes. We'll take a hundred dollars
[1676.28 --> 1678.28]  So the phone runs on cyanogen mod
[1678.28 --> 1681.72]  It has an anodized faux metal rim and swappable backplate
[1681.72 --> 1687.72]  It's going to be manufactured in the same factory as oppo phones it packs triple noise cancelling microphones for
[1688.28 --> 1694.20]  allegedly superb call quality and pack stereo speakers similar to htc's one series
[1694.68 --> 1699.24]  However, one extra thing is the the back is supposed to be removable and you're supposed to be able to
[1699.80 --> 1703.56]  Customize your back similarly to the the moto x customize your own x
[1704.36 --> 1709.96]  Style thing where you can get like wooden styled ones and all these other stuff ones as well. That's cool. Yeah, and then this is
[1709.96 --> 1713.40]  This is this is this is a marketing disaster in my mind
[1713.40 --> 1718.04]  So they're running a they're running a never settle campaign
[1718.68 --> 1720.04]  called talking about
[1720.04 --> 1725.00]  Trademarks smash your phone. I know right like amd does that man
[1725.72 --> 1732.60]  Smash your phone okay, so what they're saying is you can buy the one plus one for a dollar
[1733.24 --> 1738.92]  By applying to be one of the first to own it, so you'll also be one of the first to have it. Okay, so you apply
[1738.92 --> 1743.24]  You stand out so they're going to choose a hundred applicants to be the smashers
[1743.64 --> 1748.60]  Smash and share share a video of your smash on youtube and a one plus one will be yours
[1748.60 --> 1755.24]  You will get a 16 gig silk white and three invites for other people to purchase the phone something
[1755.24 --> 1760.04]  That's actually a pretty hot item right now people people want to buy these phones now
[1760.12 --> 1764.20]  One sort of challenge here, and I okay. I see they don't have their uh
[1764.20 --> 1769.40]  There we go. There's a list of the qualifying phones which I can't find right now
[1769.40 --> 1773.96]  I think if you click on I'll smash my right there. Ah, there we go. Yeah, there you go
[1773.96 --> 1774.28]  There you go
[1774.28 --> 1776.76]  So there's a list of the qualifying smashable phones
[1777.24 --> 1782.28]  So few problems here problem number one is that the vast majority of those smashable phones
[1782.68 --> 1786.12]  Can probably be traded in for anywhere from two to three hundred dollars
[1786.12 --> 1791.56]  So you could do the environmentally and just generally
[1792.20 --> 1799.16]  Responsible thing and trade in your phone and then just buy one number two actually is is a
[1799.80 --> 1805.16]  Sort of part of that last thing. I just said is the environmental impact of smashing phones
[1805.48 --> 1809.96]  I mean some of the chemicals that that are in phone screens phone batteries
[1809.96 --> 1816.76]  Are things that should really be disposed of safely? Not just if you're gonna do this like at the very least
[1817.32 --> 1821.72]  Go remove the back remove the battery put the backpack on so no one can tell and then smash it
[1822.36 --> 1824.92]  On the other hand, you know, iphone 5 is on the list
[1825.08 --> 1829.40]  So it's not like you can remove the battery from that like this. This is like really brutal. Yeah
[1830.12 --> 1833.32]  So that to me just smacks of irresponsibility
[1833.32 --> 1838.44]  And then on top of that we've had this issue a number of times where
[1839.24 --> 1846.20]  We announce a contest and people just don't listen completely don't people can't listen for 20 seconds
[1847.56 --> 1848.68]  like
[1848.92 --> 1850.04]  At all
[1850.04 --> 1853.80]  For example the HTC 1 m8 giveaway. We've got two phones
[1853.80 --> 1858.52]  I am announcing the winners during this show by the way the HTC 1 m8 giveaway that we did
[1859.16 --> 1860.60]  I said
[1860.60 --> 1863.56]  Click the link in the video description
[1864.92 --> 1866.68]  There are instructions there
[1866.68 --> 1871.88]  The number of people who posted their favorite thing about the 1 m8 under the video
[1872.44 --> 1878.68]  Was like in the hundreds and I'm like you guys you didn't you didn't listen you're not entered in the giveaway
[1879.16 --> 1883.24]  And I'm sorry. I mean it's great that you posted that it actually generated a lot of great discussion
[1883.56 --> 1886.36]  And maybe some people double posted. I know some people did
[1886.36 --> 1890.04]  But guys you're not in the giveaway. You got to pay attention
[1890.68 --> 1892.12]  So here we go
[1892.68 --> 1899.48]  Example of not paying attention being a big problem ahead of the contest people are already smashing their phones
[1899.48 --> 1901.48]  This is an article on Android Authority
[1902.20 --> 1907.40]  Where they complain about some of the same things that I really didn't like about this whole contest
[1907.56 --> 1910.84]  So this was this was an Android authorities
[1910.84 --> 1917.40]  article where apparently one of these guys here didn't even fully understand what product was being given away
[1917.72 --> 1920.04]  And thought that it was actually an HTC 1
[1923.48 --> 1926.28]  So here this guy I don't know if this was the one or not
[1926.28 --> 1934.44]  But this is painful to watch because unless one plus decides to do some some PR you know
[1935.80 --> 1936.92]  fixing here and
[1937.56 --> 1943.16]  Give phones to the people who already smashed them before they knew they were entered this guy just wrecked a
[1944.04 --> 1946.04]  perfectly good iPhone and
[1948.12 --> 1952.20]  It's dead now and he's not getting a one plus one
[1952.20 --> 1958.20]  So wow yeah, no no, okay. Yeah, not recoverable. No
[1959.32 --> 1961.16]  No, this will not be being used anymore
[1961.80 --> 1966.60]  At first I was like, uh, it's not that hard to replace iPhone screens in the back. It's probably nope
[1967.72 --> 1970.60]  Snap a nap kind of brutal. I was looking at this earlier
[1971.48 --> 1975.48]  And I wouldn't be surprised if a massive amount of the entrance are Z10s
[1976.20 --> 1982.20]  You can get those a lot cheaper than the rest of the phones and because you don't have to you don't have to smash your phone first
[1982.60 --> 1984.60]  Yeah, making sure people got that part
[1985.56 --> 1989.80]  People entering could say that they have one and then go out and buy one and smash it if they get selected
[1990.92 --> 1995.88]  Not that that's a good thing. Yeah, but still I fully suspect a lot of people are going to do that though
[1995.88 --> 2000.84]  We still don't want people to do that. Okay, that's also not the point at all of what they're trying to do
[2001.24 --> 2003.64]  So their whole PR thing is also not going to work
[2004.28 --> 2007.96]  Because it's just a whole bunch of people going. Oh, well, I don't have to smash my phone
[2007.96 --> 2014.52]  I can retire it to my mom or do whatever and get someone else's or it's going to be a lot of phones that don't work
[2015.40 --> 2018.92]  Right already and then they're going to smash them and throw them away. I don't know
[2018.92 --> 2023.00]  So those should still be disposed of environment in an environmentally friendly manner
[2023.40 --> 2025.88]  All right. So this was posted by Jupp Petit
[2026.60 --> 2028.60]  whatever that guy
[2028.60 --> 2034.60]  Intel is allegedly working on a new Thunderbolt controller chip to drive two
[2035.32 --> 2037.88]  4k displays at the same time
[2038.36 --> 2041.64]  So it will use PCI Express Gen 3
[2042.04 --> 2048.12]  Which means that hopefully by the time this rolls out AMD and Nvidia will be like
[2048.44 --> 2052.12]  comfortable enough with the level of performance that Thunderbolt is delivering to give us
[2052.68 --> 2060.20]  drivers to enable external GPUs because you can already hook up a graphics card on a PCI express to Thunderbolt bridge
[2060.76 --> 2065.56]  That should work. It's AMD and Nvidia not providing a driver that is causing it to not work
[2065.56 --> 2069.08]  And I don't know the reasons they're not providing a driver. There could be very good reasons
[2069.32 --> 2074.12]  But hopefully when this happens, we'll get that what we'll definitely get is
[2074.52 --> 2081.80]  40 gigabit per second bandwidth and enough to like I said to drive two 4k displays off of a single cable
[2081.80 --> 2083.64]  I mean, that's one of the reasons
[2083.64 --> 2088.28]  Probably why Apple has six Thunderbolt 2 connectors on the Mac Pro
[2088.76 --> 2092.36]  Because it's not uncommon for a creative professional to have two
[2093.00 --> 2097.16]  Usually two and often three or even more displays connected
[2097.40 --> 2102.68]  So even though we joke about the Mac Pro and we go, oh, that's all the external expansion it has
[2102.68 --> 2108.76]  And you and there's that there's that awesome picture of of the then and now with the old Mac Pro in the tower
[2108.76 --> 2114.44]  And the new Mac Pro with all the like with like the CD drive like connected externally and all the crap piled around it
[2114.60 --> 2115.72]  We joke about that
[2115.72 --> 2120.84]  But a big part of the reason is actually well, you just need to be able to drive displays off the thing
[2121.56 --> 2125.32]  So right now you can't do a single 4k display yet
[2126.04 --> 2128.52]  Off of a Thunderbolt connector. All right, you can sorry
[2128.52 --> 2135.48]  You can do only a single 4k display off of a Thunderbolt connector and with 4k coming down in price so quickly and so dramatically
[2137.24 --> 2140.20]  Running multiple 4k displays. It's gonna be a thing really soon
[2140.20 --> 2144.92]  One of the coolest things too is its ability to drive up to 100 watts of power. I know
[2145.48 --> 2150.36]  That's solid. So get this. I mean again, like the notebooks of the future, right?
[2150.36 --> 2154.76]  Where you take I mean this has Thunderbolt like not Thunderbolt
[2155.48 --> 2158.44]  40 gigabit per second charges off of the thing
[2158.44 --> 2165.96]  So the way this is gonna work guys is you're gonna plug into your your Thunderbolt enabled monitor
[2166.44 --> 2172.36]  That also has a Thunderbolt, you know external GPU slot that also has a Thunderbolt
[2172.60 --> 2176.92]  Everything else you're gonna need you're gonna plug your laptop one cable
[2177.56 --> 2182.60]  Your laptop will be charging it will be running it will be outputting to the display
[2183.64 --> 2185.00]  and like
[2185.00 --> 2186.76]  All your other peripherals
[2186.76 --> 2187.80]  Mind blown
[2187.80 --> 2193.48]  They need to start calling these things really cool names like alpine rage out the chip
[2194.12 --> 2194.76]  I
[2194.76 --> 2201.56]  Actually had a call with someone from intel today and I found out how intel does their code names really? Yeah
[2202.28 --> 2204.28]  That's actually really cool. Yeah, so
[2204.28 --> 2208.92]  Um, sometimes and like there's no there's no hard and fast way, but he gave me two scenarios
[2209.24 --> 2212.60]  So sometimes they the the project lead
[2212.92 --> 2219.16]  Whoever owns the project literally picks from a list of code names and goes that one seems pretty neat and assigns it
[2219.80 --> 2221.64]  Do you know how devil's canyon was done?
[2222.20 --> 2228.04]  No, there's a group within intel that puts on I believe it's land fest is the events that they work on
[2228.04 --> 2232.12]  And the way that the whole land fest project works I had no idea and this is really cool
[2232.36 --> 2235.00]  Is that intel employees who are passionate about gaming?
[2235.48 --> 2237.00]  Donate their time
[2237.00 --> 2239.00]  Really and then intel
[2239.00 --> 2245.96]  Pays but not the employees they pay to a charity of the choice of the employees donating their time to the project
[2246.68 --> 2250.36]  So intel is ultimately still paying for all the land fest stuff
[2250.36 --> 2255.32]  But it's the employees who are truly passionate about it driving it and then intel is
[2256.04 --> 2258.04]  Turning that into a charitable donation
[2258.04 --> 2259.08]  So I thought that was really anyway
[2259.08 --> 2259.88]  That is really cool
[2259.88 --> 2265.08]  So the way that devil's canyon the alleged rumored upcoming intel
[2266.12 --> 2270.36]  CPU refresh was named was by polling those guys
[2271.96 --> 2272.60]  That's kind of cool
[2272.60 --> 2278.28]  So they gave them a bunch of options they were like what do you think is like the coolest one for an enthusiast grade product?
[2278.52 --> 2280.60]  And they're like overwhelmingly devil's canyon
[2280.60 --> 2281.48]  Devil's canyon
[2281.48 --> 2282.52]  And I was like oh that's cool
[2282.52 --> 2283.40]  That sounds badass
[2283.40 --> 2283.64]  Yeah
[2283.64 --> 2284.76]  So like that's cool
[2284.76 --> 2285.72]  I think that's fantastic
[2285.72 --> 2288.92]  It's like alpine ridge which sounds like a body wash
[2289.96 --> 2293.72]  Or like maybe a sports refresher energy drink
[2293.72 --> 2295.56]  Yeah, yeah, it could be a drink
[2295.56 --> 2298.44]  It could be like um, it could be like ski goggles
[2299.00 --> 2299.32]  Yeah
[2299.32 --> 2301.32]  Like I could see it being a piece of apparel
[2301.32 --> 2302.20]  Definitely
[2302.20 --> 2303.56]  But why not like Thor?
[2304.12 --> 2304.84]  Thor?
[2304.84 --> 2307.24]  Well, I think there's issues there with Marvel
[2308.28 --> 2309.88]  But it's a Greek god
[2309.88 --> 2310.76]  That's true
[2312.60 --> 2313.64]  You shouldn't be able to
[2313.64 --> 2315.40]  You're probably not wrong
[2315.40 --> 2315.64]  Yeah
[2315.64 --> 2318.04]  But that's stupid that you're probably not wrong
[2318.04 --> 2318.44]  Yeah
[2318.44 --> 2319.24]  I don't like that
[2319.80 --> 2321.08]  I mean they wouldn't like it
[2321.64 --> 2323.00]  No, I'm sure not
[2323.00 --> 2325.80]  Isn't it like Sony owns the rights to mutant or something?
[2325.80 --> 2326.68]  Oh, I don't
[2326.68 --> 2328.12]  I don't remember what it is
[2328.12 --> 2330.12]  There's like some super common word
[2330.12 --> 2332.84]  And it's part of the reason why Spider-Man can't be whatever
[2332.84 --> 2337.80]  So one issue here is that the powered Thunderbolt 3, I guess whatever we're gonna call it
[2337.80 --> 2343.40]  The 40 gigabit per second Thunderbolt connector would actually have to be a different connector
[2343.40 --> 2344.04]  Unfortunately
[2344.04 --> 2344.68]  Yeah
[2344.68 --> 2347.40]  But there'll probably be some kind of an adapter system
[2347.40 --> 2348.84]  I mean the thing about PCI Express
[2348.84 --> 2350.60]  Which is what Thunderbolt is based on
[2350.60 --> 2353.56]  Is that it is forwards and backwards compatible
[2353.56 --> 2355.24]  So as long as you had a physical adapter
[2355.24 --> 2357.56]  Your older Thunderbolt gear should still be okay
[2357.56 --> 2361.72]  Something that will be good news to folks who have heavily invested in Thunderbolt
[2362.52 --> 2363.08]  Because a lot of stuff's not cheap
[2363.08 --> 2363.64]  To whom I would say
[2363.64 --> 2364.12]  Because a lot of stuff's not cheap
[2364.12 --> 2364.68]  Why?
[2367.80 --> 2371.40]  I still don't quite understand why people buy Thunderbolt gear
[2371.40 --> 2372.68]  It's so much more expensive
[2372.68 --> 2373.32]  I know
[2374.04 --> 2375.72]  But you're saying that's why they buy it?
[2375.72 --> 2376.04]  No
[2376.04 --> 2377.88]  I'm like agreeing with you
[2377.88 --> 2379.32]  Being like yeah I don't know I don't get it
[2379.32 --> 2381.08]  We don't use anything as Thunderbolt
[2381.08 --> 2383.32]  We actually do own one Thunderbolt piece of gear
[2383.32 --> 2383.96]  What thing?
[2383.96 --> 2384.92]  We didn't pay for it though
[2384.92 --> 2385.32]  Oh
[2385.32 --> 2388.84]  Um we have an external drive from Western Digital
[2388.84 --> 2389.32]  Oh yeah
[2389.32 --> 2391.32]  That's like a dual drive drive
[2391.96 --> 2393.88]  And uh it's kind of cool actually
[2393.88 --> 2394.04]  Yeah
[2394.60 --> 2395.56]  But we didn't pay for that
[2396.20 --> 2397.56]  That's true we did not
[2397.56 --> 2398.92]  I don't know we own two pieces
[2398.92 --> 2400.04]  We have a hard drive dock
[2401.00 --> 2401.96]  Also we didn't pay for
[2402.76 --> 2403.00]  Okay
[2404.12 --> 2405.40]  I'll let you handle this one
[2405.40 --> 2407.00]  This one's really short but
[2407.00 --> 2410.92]  Has Virtuix managed to make themselves relevant again?
[2411.56 --> 2412.52]  Uh no
[2412.52 --> 2413.32]  Okay
[2413.32 --> 2415.24]  This isn't going to consumers
[2415.24 --> 2416.04]  At least right away
[2416.92 --> 2419.00]  So that's why it's like what
[2419.00 --> 2420.60]  Anyways there's a
[2420.60 --> 2422.52]  There's a modify
[2422.52 --> 2424.92]  Modification kit thing for the Virtuix Omni
[2424.92 --> 2426.52]  Right now it's one package
[2426.52 --> 2428.68]  Hopefully later it'll be a kit that consumers can buy
[2428.68 --> 2429.80]  But right now it's kind of
[2429.80 --> 2431.16]  To upgrade existing Omnis
[2431.16 --> 2433.64]  Yes but it's right now it's just for
[2433.64 --> 2435.64]  It's a design project
[2436.36 --> 2437.56]  With the universe
[2437.56 --> 2439.40]  With Rice University in Texas
[2439.40 --> 2442.76]  It's R&D for possibly military training applications
[2442.76 --> 2444.76]  It's not a consumer level thing
[2445.32 --> 2447.96]  But I fully expect people to scream for it
[2447.96 --> 2450.44]  So it'll probably become a consumer level thing at some time
[2450.44 --> 2451.80]  They said they may offer it
[2451.80 --> 2454.20]  But they're not dedicated to anything right now
[2454.20 --> 2457.64]  And like Linus said it's going to be an upgrade kit to the existing Omni
[2457.64 --> 2461.00]  So if you already bought one you don't have to worry about buying an entirely new kit
[2461.00 --> 2462.44]  Which is going to cost way more money
[2462.44 --> 2465.56]  You just buy an upgrade kit which could possibly be even more
[2465.56 --> 2466.92]  Looking at the size of the thing
[2466.92 --> 2468.76]  Which we have only the one picture of
[2468.76 --> 2469.88]  So you can show that
[2469.88 --> 2470.76]  Oops sorry
[2470.76 --> 2472.44]  Just poked the crap out of your screen sorry
[2472.44 --> 2475.16]  So you can see it's
[2475.16 --> 2479.16]  It actually looks a lot more like the ghetto Omnis that people have been making
[2480.04 --> 2483.64]  Having the four post system with the supports coming in
[2483.64 --> 2488.84]  So the idea with this is that it can go up and down with you but then still provide support
[2489.40 --> 2489.72]  Right
[2489.72 --> 2492.68]  It's a pretty interesting project but I don't expect it to be cheap
[2492.68 --> 2497.96]  And I think that's part of the reason why it's more of a military training application idea
[2497.96 --> 2503.08]  And not necessarily a consumer idea is even as an upgrade kit I expect this to be really expensive
[2503.48 --> 2508.28]  So current level Omnis you can run around and you can jump
[2508.28 --> 2508.44]  Yeah
[2508.44 --> 2510.52]  Can you imagine jumping on that thing though?
[2511.32 --> 2511.96]  That'd be tough
[2511.96 --> 2513.40]  I was actually just going to bring this up
[2513.40 --> 2514.20]  Okay go ahead
[2514.20 --> 2516.12]  Currently you can run around and you can
[2516.76 --> 2519.16]  I should have done quote unquote jump because that makes more sense
[2519.64 --> 2520.76]  And now you'll be able to crouch
[2520.76 --> 2526.84]  Part of the problem with them claiming jumping is one of the abilities is I fully expect if you did that all the time
[2527.32 --> 2529.64]  You would end up breaking things or yourself
[2530.20 --> 2534.60]  Because they have essentially if you've ever been longboarding or if you have friends that have been longboarding
[2534.60 --> 2540.60]  If they have those longboarding gloves with the like slick plasticky kind of pad things on their gloves
[2540.84 --> 2543.88]  You're essentially wearing those on your feet on a plastic surface
[2544.36 --> 2547.00]  So you slide a lot that's the whole point
[2547.00 --> 2549.56]  So it feels like you're running as you're putting your feet on plastic
[2549.56 --> 2551.16]  It's because it slides down
[2551.16 --> 2554.68]  So jumping on that type of a surface if you're actually trying to get a lot of air
[2555.88 --> 2557.08]  Yeah, it's going to be kind of scary
[2557.08 --> 2558.84]  So there's not a ton to say in there
[2559.64 --> 2563.88]  If you do want it, I'm sure contacting virtuix would help it come to the consumer end
[2564.44 --> 2566.12]  But just remember it's going to be really expensive
[2566.12 --> 2569.96]  How would you feel as an omni kickstarter backer at this point?
[2569.96 --> 2576.44]  That thing has been so up and down with the recent thing out of um out of oculus being
[2576.44 --> 2581.08]  Yeah, we're focused on a sitting down experience not on a moving around experience, so
[2582.84 --> 2583.56]  There's there's
[2583.56 --> 2585.56]  I know someone who backed it
[2585.56 --> 2585.96]  Do you?
[2585.96 --> 2586.20]  Yeah
[2586.20 --> 2588.04]  And like bought the whole thing?
[2588.04 --> 2588.60]  Yeah
[2588.60 --> 2590.12]  Like a full bag like the $400?
[2590.12 --> 2590.60]  Yeah
[2590.60 --> 2590.92]  Okay
[2590.92 --> 2591.64]  Okay
[2591.64 --> 2592.92]  I don't
[2592.92 --> 2593.32]  Um
[2593.32 --> 2595.08]  I don't know
[2595.08 --> 2595.96]  Um
[2595.96 --> 2599.08]  I would be paying a lot of attention to the the small groups
[2599.08 --> 2601.80]  Very small groups right now that are working on a
[2602.36 --> 2606.28]  I can't even call it ghetto solution because it has to be pretty advanced for this to work properly
[2606.28 --> 2607.32]  Um
[2609.48 --> 2609.80]  But
[2610.68 --> 2614.60]  Like the the the the the moving of the camera
[2615.32 --> 2621.64]  They're trying to make that a reality but having it based off your physical movement is going to impede you a lot for one
[2621.64 --> 2622.04]  Right
[2622.04 --> 2627.48]  And there's gonna be if unless it's like hardcore strapped in which is going to be highly uncomfortable
[2627.96 --> 2632.60]  There's going to be mechanical lag because you're going to turn and then it's going to have to pick up with you
[2632.60 --> 2633.16]  Right
[2633.16 --> 2637.16]  And then there's software problems with it shifting too much and then
[2637.72 --> 2642.84]  Motorized versions that detect your movement based off of the connect are going to have problems again
[2643.56 --> 2648.04]  And there's yeah, I don't know they're they're trying to make something work
[2648.60 --> 2654.20]  But none of the solutions are very feasible yet and they're all aftermarket ones omni hasn't said anything
[2655.24 --> 2658.04]  Right about it actually happening you mean oculus
[2659.16 --> 2663.08]  No, or omni omni. Oh, okay. Sorry. Yeah, no worries virtuix I should have said
[2663.72 --> 2665.72]  Yeah
[2666.36 --> 2667.72]  Huh
[2667.72 --> 2673.40]  All right, it's an interesting situation, but I just people do have to realize that that quote is very real
[2673.72 --> 2680.28]  Um, they're they're focusing the seated forward facing this box of field of view from the camera position
[2680.28 --> 2681.88]  I mean cool stuff's gonna happen in the future
[2682.36 --> 2687.56]  But for now they want to focus on one thing at a time and I totally get that and I respect that yeah, yeah
[2688.12 --> 2692.04]  Um speaking of really quickly, but yeah, I respect that wow what's going on?
[2692.04 --> 2692.12]  Yeah
[2692.12 --> 2694.12]  It's okay
[2694.20 --> 2699.96]  Anyway, speaking of things that are are good. I guess uh the facebook oculus acquisition
[2699.96 --> 2703.48]  Is a done deal now? It's been approved by the feds
[2703.80 --> 2704.52]  So there you go
[2704.52 --> 2711.56]  I guess that's all we really have to say that the last thing is and I apologize guys. This is another oculus
[2711.56 --> 2718.12]  Um, this is another oculus story, but it's one that leads into a very interesting conversation
[2719.08 --> 2724.12]  Oculus facebook sees movies as the next big thing for oculus rift
[2724.12 --> 2728.28]  So this is an article from tech radar and I
[2729.24 --> 2734.12]  Would like for us to have a bit of a conversation here. We haven't we haven't primed this one at all
[2734.76 --> 2740.52]  Um other than just to have sort of notes on it, which I just closed so now I've got nothing but
[2741.88 --> 2746.68]  You know what here? Why don't you do the facts and then we'll have the discussion this one. Yeah, so
[2747.40 --> 2750.12]  Uh, what do you mean by facts? I mean the things in there
[2750.76 --> 2753.96]  Okay, so according to cory, I can't say your last name
[2754.52 --> 2761.24]  Of mobile engineering virtual reality is destined to go well beyond gaming and movies seem to be the obvious next conquest
[2761.24 --> 2763.80]  People have been talking about going to imax
[2763.88 --> 2771.00]  Essentially and wearing an oculus and how that experience could be with the the awesome audio and everything else that there is in an imax
[2771.56 --> 2778.12]  Um another quote by the same. I can't pronounce your last name. I'm very sorry facebook's vp of mobile engineering
[2778.12 --> 2782.52]  Uh, I am completely excited about the intersection of hollywood and virtual reality
[2783.32 --> 2786.92]  I think we're going to I think we're going to see the next uh
[2788.60 --> 2792.84]  I think what we're going to see i've mixed one word there over the next coming year is going to be truly spectacular
[2793.80 --> 2797.48]  So essentially there's just a lot of we're interesting one of the problems is going to be
[2798.04 --> 2800.04]  You're not going to be able to shoot content
[2800.04 --> 2807.24]  That's actually properly designed for a rift by using the same kind of camera setup that we use and what a lot of
[2807.72 --> 2813.00]  Much better camera setup, but what a lot of movies would use which is like a prime camera and maybe one or two other shots
[2813.64 --> 2815.08]  And then that's it you're going to need
[2815.72 --> 2819.08]  An insane amount of cameras because you're gonna have to be able to capture everything
[2819.32 --> 2823.80]  And part of your problem is going to be like people and stuff which would normally be behind the scenes
[2823.80 --> 2826.28]  Well, if someone goes like this what's going to happen?
[2827.00 --> 2834.04]  It's yeah, so in my mind the only way for a vr film to work properly
[2834.52 --> 2839.24]  would be autonomous an autonomous array of relatively inexpensive
[2839.88 --> 2840.76]  um
[2840.76 --> 2842.76]  Omni-directional cameras
[2842.76 --> 2846.20]  So if and you won't be able unless you can make drones
[2846.84 --> 2850.60]  Much much quieter than they are and much much more advanced than they are
[2851.16 --> 2854.60]  You're not going to be able to record sound with any I guess okay
[2854.60 --> 2859.48]  You could mic up everyone and everything but still that wouldn't help for ambient sound collection
[2859.80 --> 2864.92]  So you're going to need an autonomous array of drones and then you're going to need to have a crazy
[2865.48 --> 2873.32]  Sophisticated way of having each of them overlap each other's images enough to cancel each other out
[2873.32 --> 2880.04]  So that you can't see the drones or whether it's drones or whether it's something else the way that the camera arrays will have to work
[2880.04 --> 2885.48]  Will have to be so that for every camera that's positioned so so let's let's say you guys are looking at a top-down view
[2885.64 --> 2887.64]  So for every camera positioned here
[2888.04 --> 2891.80]  There's going to have to be one here and here so that we can see
[2892.12 --> 2895.72]  Anything that would have been blocked by this one from this camera position here
[2895.88 --> 2903.24]  Because someone has to be able for to for me for me for vr to be a way for me to compellingly be told a story
[2903.88 --> 2904.28]  Um
[2904.28 --> 2911.64]  It's going to have to work the same way that vr would work in a game where I can walk around in the environment
[2911.88 --> 2919.08]  Which leads us to the other reasonable future scenario, which is maybe we just do away with
[2919.96 --> 2922.36]  sets and actors and
[2923.24 --> 2925.24]  The whole thing goes full CGI
[2925.24 --> 2930.36]  Um, I mean you're still gonna have that you're still gonna have that
[2931.00 --> 2935.80]  Not it's not quite real. It's it's still a little bit creepy effect
[2936.60 --> 2939.96]  But not if it's not if it's designed to not look real
[2940.84 --> 2946.76]  Okay, if it's not designed to look real then I guess there's that but that still doesn't address any kind of um
[2948.36 --> 2950.36]  Any kind of
[2950.36 --> 2955.64]  Footage of anything that's like actually real like I don't know I don't know if I'm explaining this properly
[2955.64 --> 2956.76]  I think
[2956.76 --> 2959.32]  This could be the first the first
[2960.04 --> 2962.68]  Technological thing that happens that really makes me feel old
[2963.40 --> 2967.56]  because I get the feeling much like anyone who
[2968.52 --> 2974.04]  You know kind of looked at mp3s or still looks at mp3s today and goes
[2974.36 --> 2976.68]  Well, the radio was good enough when I was a kid
[2976.68 --> 2978.60]  So the radio is good enough now
[2978.60 --> 2982.12]  And you know what the radio is still great, but I think for me
[2982.84 --> 2987.16]  This is not going to be a compelling way to watch a movie for an hour and a half
[2987.16 --> 2989.56]  I don't think it will be now one of the problems you see when you
[2990.52 --> 2996.04]  Come out with a new medium like let's look at video games when video games first started being a really big deal
[2996.04 --> 3001.32]  What a lot of people started trying to do was and now I'm not saying pong I'm saying
[3002.20 --> 3006.36]  Stuff beyond that they tried making movies that were interactive
[3006.36 --> 3010.60]  Do you remember that people were trying to merge movies and video games and they try to make these like stupid
[3011.24 --> 3014.92]  Playable on your dvd player video games because they were like movies and games
[3015.56 --> 3015.88]  Yeah
[3015.88 --> 3018.68]  The second you try to merge things like this
[3019.24 --> 3024.44]  There's gonna be the people that kind of half-ass it at the beginning and it's not going to work very well
[3024.68 --> 3030.04]  What people are going to have to actually do is create an experience focused around the idea that it's
[3030.68 --> 3032.28]  a movie for virtual reality
[3033.72 --> 3038.28]  And it's going to have to be filmed completely differently is going to have to be written completely differently all the sets are going to
[3038.28 --> 3039.48]  Have to be made completely differently
[3040.44 --> 3044.28]  Everything is going to have to be totally different. I think it's going to be a long time until we get there
[3044.28 --> 3047.88]  Even if we start trying now, I think everything's going to be kind of crap at the beginning
[3048.44 --> 3048.92]  Um
[3048.92 --> 3052.84]  I mean, there's a lot of different ways vr could work for a movie. I mean like
[3052.84 --> 3053.48]  um
[3054.28 --> 3055.80]  I guess you wouldn't even need to be
[3056.52 --> 3062.12]  VR in order for like as camera technology changes if you could watch the movie flat
[3062.68 --> 3067.08]  Or if you could watch the movie from the perspective of any one character that you pick
[3067.48 --> 3072.60]  Like if you could cycle through or whatever else like there's a lot of different things that can happen here
[3072.60 --> 3075.72]  I just don't know which one of them which ones of them will be enjoyable
[3075.96 --> 3080.04]  That's something that's interested me as well as if you can be like I am the lead character
[3080.04 --> 3084.52]  Or I am the supporting role and you want to see it from their angle. I want to be sauron
[3085.00 --> 3087.48]  Yeah, like something like that, but then what's your movie going to be?
[3088.04 --> 3089.96]  Yeah, that's another part of the problem when I brought in
[3090.52 --> 3094.76]  Sets and scripts and all that kind of stuff because he's not actually in that much of the movie
[3095.00 --> 3097.08]  So how do you make that a movie right?
[3097.08 --> 3099.32]  Well, there'd be much more filming and then part of the problem is
[3099.88 --> 3102.92]  You're bringing in way more angles and you're bringing in way more possibilities
[3102.92 --> 3108.36]  So that is going to raise cost by a lot if you have to produce an entire movie from different people's perspectives
[3108.36 --> 3110.04]  But the same feature length
[3111.80 --> 3113.96]  That's a lot of editing and production
[3113.96 --> 3116.84]  It sounds like a crazy kickstarter project that just might work
[3118.12 --> 3121.00]  Yeah, that's what it sounds like to me. It sounds like someone's gonna try
[3121.40 --> 3126.52]  Someone will try. Oh, definitely like this will happen and I fully expect I think it's all I'm all I'm trying to say is
[3126.52 --> 3127.72]  I think there's gonna be growing pain
[3128.20 --> 3131.24]  I don't I don't think it's not gonna grow. I don't think it's not gonna happen. I'm pretty sure
[3131.24 --> 3134.36]  Facebook has made it extremely clear that they want this to happen
[3137.80 --> 3138.84]  Yeah, I don't know
[3140.28 --> 3144.20]  It's gonna be interesting. I have a feeling I'm gonna be a geezer about it though
[3144.60 --> 3149.96]  Because it just doesn't sound that appealing to me gaming VR. Yeah heads up are like definitely two thumbs up
[3150.52 --> 3155.16]  Um augmented reality VR. Oh, yeah, I'm so into that. Yeah, for sure
[3155.16 --> 3162.12]  That's I'm actually more excited about that than sitting down in VR me too, but I don't see that as being very good for a while
[3162.28 --> 3166.52]  Oh, it's gonna be a long time. Yeah, that's that's the holy grail. That's why I'm focusing on me
[3166.52 --> 3168.52]  I mean that goes all the way back to our
[3169.08 --> 3173.80]  Virtual like flying RC things at each other football field where yeah, yeah
[3174.12 --> 3177.64]  That goes all the way back to that's like that is exciting. That's the kind of thing that I would
[3177.64 --> 3181.24]  Well, have you seen the the digital trips thing from watchdogs?
[3181.24 --> 3188.04]  No, when you go around on I'm trying I'm gonna this is stuff that's been already released
[3188.04 --> 3192.52]  So if you're waiting for watchdogs, maybe plug your ears, but this is not I don't think they're trying to hide this
[3192.52 --> 3194.52]  This isn't really a spoiler alert or anything like that
[3194.84 --> 3199.72]  but digital trips you can walk around and people on the street will just try and sell you like digital trips and
[3200.60 --> 3205.08]  You will it like changes how the game plays and like one of them
[3205.08 --> 3209.88]  I can't remember what it's actually called, but you turn into this giant spider tank, right?
[3209.88 --> 3213.00]  So you're a tank, but it has like spider legs and stuff sure
[3213.00 --> 3215.96]  And you just run around and jump around the city and just blow crap up
[3216.44 --> 3220.76]  And you have like a cannon and it's just ridiculous, but you're it's a digital trip and I
[3221.32 --> 3225.56]  Don't remember exactly if there's like side effects or crazy things that can happen or anything like that
[3225.56 --> 3229.64]  I haven't looked way too far into it, but like that kind of stuff would be really cool
[3229.64 --> 3234.12]  Like altering that like alternate reality with the football field and stuff
[3234.12 --> 3238.60]  Yeah, take that idea or you're just like sitting on the bleachers and it's a normal day
[3239.16 --> 3244.20]  But then all of a sudden there's spider tanks and helicopters and stuff and you're fighting your buddy and like
[3244.52 --> 3246.20]  Yeah, it's gonna be awesome. That would be really cool
[3248.04 --> 3248.76]  All right, so
[3249.72 --> 3254.68]  That's that's it for virtual reality stuff for today. Don't worry guys. Yep. Um, amazon
[3254.68 --> 3262.84]  Amazon has secured a deal to provide hbo premium content to amazon prime members
[3263.96 --> 3268.04]  You will be able to access hbo shows not all of them
[3268.68 --> 3272.36]  HBO is going to be sticking to like a multi-year
[3273.08 --> 3277.48]  delay between when they release content and then when
[3278.12 --> 3284.52]  Stuff's available sort of elsewhere, but what's amazing about this whole thing is this is this is hbo's first movie
[3284.68 --> 3288.04]  It's a huge deal to move towards any kind of purely digital
[3288.68 --> 3290.44]  distribution network
[3290.44 --> 3294.76]  So hbo content has already been available as on demand
[3295.16 --> 3299.48]  But this is the first time you're going to be able to stream it in an unlimited fashion
[3299.88 --> 3305.96]  Using just your amazon prime membership now amazon did recently increase the price of amazon prime
[3306.44 --> 3311.16]  But as you can already see it looks like that was for good reason
[3311.16 --> 3317.16]  And they're looking to add more value to that increased subscription in order to continue to justify it for people so
[3317.64 --> 3321.56]  um, but the first question in my mind was oh, are they gonna have game of thrones on it?
[3321.56 --> 3326.84]  No, no, no game of thrones, so it's gonna have sopranos the wire deadwood rome six feet under
[3327.48 --> 3331.00]  um, so all seasons of some of the some of the older stuff
[3331.24 --> 3334.28]  It's gonna have select seasons of newer stuff like true blood
[3334.28 --> 3341.72]  It's gonna have some original movies like too big to fail and you don't know jack and some documentaries some comedy specials
[3341.80 --> 3348.04]  From Ellen DeGeneres and so folks like that. It's gonna have some of the mini series like a band of brothers
[3348.52 --> 3352.04]  And there you go as an amazon prime member. So if you have a kindle
[3352.60 --> 3357.32]  TV or whatever that fire tv. Thank you if you have a fire tv then you i'm really off today
[3358.04 --> 3363.16]  Then you're gonna be able to stream these to yourself, and I think that's that's great
[3364.04 --> 3371.08]  But just plain not enough. Yeah, I uh, I hbo needs to figure it out
[3371.80 --> 3378.84]  In my opinion they need to they need to start because what was it like game of thrones was the most downloaded thing through torrents ever
[3378.84 --> 3383.40]  Didn't they win that twice or something? I think so and like come on guys
[3383.72 --> 3387.24]  Maybe figure it out at some point in time get a website. I'll pay a subscription
[3387.40 --> 3392.36]  I don't even have a cable connection, but I'd love to watch your shows. I honestly haven't
[3392.36 --> 3398.68]  I think i've watched like the first almost the first season of game of thrones because I watched it at my parents house
[3399.64 --> 3406.04]  Like i'd love to see it going through the books, but i i'm kind of holding out because hbo's gotta
[3406.60 --> 3408.60]  Revolutionize in some form at some point in time
[3409.32 --> 3410.60]  They have to
[3410.60 --> 3413.48]  Like come on guys everyone's moving off the tv
[3414.52 --> 3416.52]  Maybe they'll get intended at some point
[3417.32 --> 3421.80]  And what was their name ario maybe ario will figure out some way oh that would be tough
[3422.76 --> 3425.00]  That'd be tough i'm pretty sure they'd lose that fight
[3426.68 --> 3433.64]  What's up next um well, I wanted that to lead into uh here we go here uh oh is that is that the article yeah awesome
[3433.64 --> 3439.72]  I couldn't see that for so I can't see that for some reason where is that oh it's way down at the bottom there we go
[3440.44 --> 3442.44]  Okay, so here we go
[3442.60 --> 3443.96]  so
[3443.96 --> 3447.80]  Again, it's not good enough and the situation is terrible
[3447.80 --> 3453.40]  So this is from slashdot actually there was I had a better article on it before but whatever the point is
[3453.88 --> 3460.20]  Hulu apparently worried that too many non-us residents are using cheap vpn services to watch its u.s programming
[3460.60 --> 3465.00]  Have started blocking ip address ranges belonging to known vpn services
[3465.48 --> 3470.84]  Hulu didn't announce the ban but users of affected vpns are getting this message based on your ip address
[3470.84 --> 3474.04]  We noticed you are trying to access hulu through an anonymous proxy tool
[3474.04 --> 3477.80]  Hulu is not currently available outside the us if you're in the us
[3477.80 --> 3480.92]  You'll need to disable your anonymizer to access videos on hulu
[3480.92 --> 3485.64]  So the problem in there now, sorry, there's the link I meant to put in there. Yeah, that's okay
[3485.64 --> 3491.48]  So the problem here is that it denies access to hulu from people
[3492.04 --> 3500.92]  Who are in the us just because they want to use a vpn to have a slightly more anonymous internet browsing experience, which is okay?
[3501.56 --> 3503.56]  Like that's fine
[3503.56 --> 3507.56]  The other issue here is that this again, so being to hbo
[3507.72 --> 3510.92]  It's not good enough to kind of go like oh, yeah
[3510.92 --> 3514.68]  Well, like some of our old stinky content that is still good
[3514.68 --> 3520.60]  But quite frankly if you were that interested in watching the sopranos you've probably already seen it. Yeah
[3520.84 --> 3523.88]  Um, like some some of our old stuff is like yeah, it's okay
[3524.36 --> 3530.12]  We need legitimate ways to access premium content in a timely manner
[3530.12 --> 3532.12]  blocking things and
[3532.92 --> 3538.60]  Holding on to things is not going to last forever, and I wish we would just hurry up and get over it
[3538.60 --> 3540.04]  I can't even remember what it was
[3540.04 --> 3548.04]  But I tried to watch a video last night or the night before on some website and it was like you can't watch this because you're in Canada
[3548.36 --> 3552.20]  And I was like oh geez and then as I'm going to close the site
[3552.52 --> 3556.92]  It has a pop-up which is like can you answer our survey about using our website?
[3556.92 --> 3559.64]  I was like yes, I hate everything
[3561.24 --> 3566.68]  Like this is so stupid. I can't use your website. It's a pretty big problem. It's uh
[3567.72 --> 3569.72]  and I'm so frustrated
[3569.72 --> 3577.40]  It's not clear to me what the solution is because I mean you know part of the problem is that advertisers aren't going to want their advertising impressions
[3577.40 --> 3581.32]  Wasted on people who can't even benefit from their services
[3581.32 --> 3584.92]  Find a monetization platform that works so that ads are different on
[3585.72 --> 3587.32]  When it's in it being viewed in a different country
[3587.32 --> 3591.00]  So your solution is to create a ginormous, you know
[3591.64 --> 3596.52]  Advertising network that gets puts ads everywhere. I don't think anything like that exists
[3599.32 --> 3601.32]  At first I thought you were serious
[3601.32 --> 3602.52]  I was like what?
[3602.52 --> 3608.60]  It's one of those things where to me if the issue is is advertising and licensing then figure it out
[3608.92 --> 3616.44]  But what the real issue is is protecting the providers the the existing relationships with providers that are geo specific and
[3616.76 --> 3618.84]  Geo specific just has to go
[3619.40 --> 3624.28]  It was stupid back when certain game consoles worked in certain regions
[3624.28 --> 3625.56]  It's still like that
[3625.56 --> 3631.40]  I know and it's stupid now it the whole thing is stupid dvd region locks are stupid
[3631.96 --> 3633.08]  Everything is stupid
[3633.32 --> 3641.00]  You create the content you get it in front of the eyeballs you collect the advertising revenue if the model needs to change the model needs to change
[3641.24 --> 3643.24]  Yeah, um, so
[3644.44 --> 3648.84]  It's just frustrating and like i'm i'm honest. I could have vpn to watch that video
[3649.56 --> 3655.16]  I could have figured it out, but I was just like no speaking of which speaking of vpns. I actually haven't
[3655.16 --> 3662.12]  That the way that I it's funny the way that I did my hulu plus integration not that long ago on a linus tech tips video
[3662.60 --> 3666.04]  Was by using hotspot shield our other sponsor
[3666.68 --> 3671.64]  To let me access it so I could watch the videos and I haven't actually tried again
[3672.28 --> 3677.16]  Since this news came out like hours ago to find out if hotspot shield is one of the ones affected
[3677.80 --> 3682.20]  But but anyway when it comes to netflix anyway, or you know
[3682.20 --> 3685.96]  At least other video streaming services that aren't specifically blocking vpns
[3686.12 --> 3693.88]  I can say with certainty that hotspot shield is the fast easy way to access content that is locked out of your region so hotspot shield
[3694.68 --> 3700.84]  Anonymizes you and also provides you with an ip that is based in a completely different location
[3700.84 --> 3704.20]  So you they have uk based ones they have us based ones
[3704.20 --> 3709.96]  So if you want to go on comedy central.com for example, you can watch whatever videos you want
[3709.96 --> 3714.12]  Just boom make sure and you enable hotspot shield you can actually turn it on and off
[3714.76 --> 3717.56]  And so you just kind of turn it on whenever you want to use it
[3717.56 --> 3720.92]  You turn it off whenever you want to play games and you don't want your ping times offend
[3721.48 --> 3726.60]  offended affected by the fact that you're redirecting all of your traffic through a us-based server and
[3727.56 --> 3730.44]  There you go guys you can save 20% on their elite service
[3730.44 --> 3734.60]  Which is the one that I recommend by the way the free service is ad supported so it exists
[3735.16 --> 3742.68]  But it has ads so if you want sort of the cleanest possible web browsing experience save 20% by heading over to bit.ly slash hs
[3742.68 --> 3744.92]  Share for 20% off use offer code
[3745.48 --> 3751.40]  Linus thank you hotspot shield for sponsoring today's episode of the when show we've also got
[3751.88 --> 3757.88]  Barnaclees get out of here that was from barnaclees last week who was weighing in on our g750 jay-z's
[3758.60 --> 3760.60]  Isn't that awesome that we have like matching laptops now?
[3760.60 --> 3761.32]  What's that guy's name?
[3761.32 --> 3762.20]  Wendell
[3762.20 --> 3764.60]  Yeah, we'll have a Wendell moment here
[3764.60 --> 3766.60]  No, no, the guy's no where he's facing his character
[3766.60 --> 3767.08]  Oh, Wilson
[3767.08 --> 3767.40]  Yeah
[3767.40 --> 3769.40]  Oh, well Wendell from tech syndicate does it too
[3769.40 --> 3769.88]  I know
[3769.88 --> 3771.00]  He never shows his face now
[3771.00 --> 3772.04]  But it's more Wilson
[3772.04 --> 3773.00]  Yeah, well so we'll have
[3773.00 --> 3773.80]  Can you still hear us?
[3774.84 --> 3776.28]  It's alright, it's not great
[3776.28 --> 3779.08]  Yeah, the audio is not great so maybe we'll just we'll go with this
[3779.08 --> 3785.40]  So the g750 jay-z is the next evolutionary step in the g750 series from asus
[3785.80 --> 3791.80]  And what it basically brings to the table is a lot closer to desktop grade performance
[3791.80 --> 3796.44]  And a lot closer to desktop pricing than we've ever really seen before
[3796.44 --> 3799.80]  Now we had some people question our desktop
[3799.80 --> 3802.12]  You remember the yeah, you ran the benchmarks
[3802.12 --> 3805.32]  Okay, so we had some people question our desktop when we did our comparison
[3805.32 --> 3809.80]  Because what we discovered was that matching this feature for feature spec for spec
[3809.80 --> 3813.56]  It was going to cost us about 200 less to build an equivalent desktop
[3813.56 --> 3817.80]  In terms of sort of, you know, the similar Intel CPU
[3817.80 --> 3821.40]  And a GPU that performs about the same and all that stuff
[3821.40 --> 3823.84]  But this one actually performed within what?
[3823.90 --> 3825.96]  It was about 70 to 80% of the performance of the desktop
[3825.96 --> 3829.32]  I said on the stream though that if we went for just performance on the desktop
[3829.32 --> 3830.24]  I could have smoked it
[3830.24 --> 3830.46]  Yeah
[3830.46 --> 3831.92]  We were going for feature equipment
[3831.92 --> 3833.20]  We were going for feature parity
[3833.20 --> 3838.64]  So a lot of the things that we included are things that maybe you wouldn't choose
[3838.64 --> 3843.00]  But you still have to acknowledge that they're features that are going to matter to some people
[3843.00 --> 3844.80]  And they're features that do cost money
[3844.80 --> 3848.80]  Like for example, we could have bought the cheapest possible motherboard
[3848.80 --> 3849.94]  But we didn't
[3849.94 --> 3853.68]  We bought an Asus motherboard because we were looking for quality parity
[3853.68 --> 3855.68]  And then we bought one with Thunderbolt
[3855.68 --> 3858.04]  Because this laptop has Thunderbolt
[3858.04 --> 3860.08]  Which is a feature that some people use
[3860.08 --> 3862.98]  So that's all there is to it
[3862.98 --> 3867.24]  We threw in, you know, a $20 webcam budget with the desktop
[3867.24 --> 3869.54]  Because a lot of people use webcams
[3869.54 --> 3871.40]  This notebook includes a webcam
[3871.40 --> 3873.82]  So we're going to have to include a webcam to make sure it's fair
[3873.82 --> 3876.76]  Because while you guys might not look at that and go
[3876.76 --> 3877.68]  Oh, well, it's, you know
[3877.68 --> 3878.74]  You might look at that and you go
[3878.74 --> 3880.74]  Well, oh, that's not the hardware I would have bought
[3880.74 --> 3882.00]  Therefore it's not fair
[3882.00 --> 3885.68]  Well, the laptop's available in different configurations
[3885.68 --> 3887.90]  This is the one we happen to have
[3887.90 --> 3891.08]  So we have to build something that's equivalent to it
[3891.08 --> 3893.56]  So that's basically all there is to it
[3893.56 --> 3895.32]  It runs extremely quietly at idle
[3895.32 --> 3895.98]  Here
[3895.98 --> 3900.00]  That's our microphone
[3900.00 --> 3900.90]  He put the vent, yeah
[3900.90 --> 3902.26]  He put the vent of the laptop
[3902.26 --> 3905.54]  Like inside of the fur of our, whatever this is called
[3905.54 --> 3906.32]  It's called a dead cat
[3906.32 --> 3907.60]  I don't like calling it that
[3907.60 --> 3908.98]  I know, it's called a dead cat
[3908.98 --> 3910.28]  Anyway
[3910.28 --> 3911.40]  So the point is
[3911.40 --> 3914.20]  It is extremely quiet when you're not doing anything intensive
[3914.20 --> 3916.92]  It runs cool when you're doing crazy intensive stuff
[3916.92 --> 3920.78]  And I think, is it fair to say you were blown away by how well it performs?
[3921.60 --> 3921.86]  Yeah
[3921.86 --> 3925.20]  I, I, I'll be completely honest while doing this ad integration
[3925.20 --> 3926.36]  Which might not be the greatest thing
[3926.36 --> 3928.10]  But I generally don't like laptops
[3928.10 --> 3928.54]  I know
[3928.54 --> 3930.64]  But I've used this a couple times now
[3930.64 --> 3931.68]  Like when we used it in Boston
[3931.68 --> 3932.98]  It would put videos really fast
[3932.98 --> 3934.12]  Which is really nice
[3934.12 --> 3936.50]  And I used it to play, I don't even remember what
[3936.50 --> 3938.44]  Quite a few different games with my buddy Victoria
[3938.44 --> 3940.64]  And never had a single problem
[3940.64 --> 3942.98]  I think this was actually faster than his desktop
[3942.98 --> 3945.14]  You took this on a trip to Victoria?
[3945.22 --> 3945.46]  Nope
[3945.46 --> 3947.42]  Seriously?
[3953.36 --> 3954.98]  It's company property, man
[3954.98 --> 3956.10]  You could at least tell me
[3956.10 --> 3957.90]  I didn't, I was talking about my laptop
[3957.90 --> 3959.44]  No you weren't
[3959.44 --> 3961.54]  It doesn't even have a video card in it
[3961.54 --> 3962.70]  It does actually
[3962.70 --> 3964.20]  So we've managed to make it
[3964.20 --> 3964.82]  Seriously?
[3966.44 --> 3968.52]  We've managed to make it this far into the integration
[3968.52 --> 3969.42]  Without even explaining
[3969.42 --> 3971.64]  So it's got a Core i7 4700HQ
[3971.64 --> 3972.70]  It's got an 880M
[3972.70 --> 3975.54]  Which is actually just about equivalent to a GTX 770
[3975.54 --> 3977.70]  Delivers a great gaming experience
[3977.70 --> 3978.88]  It's still portable
[3978.88 --> 3981.36]  Even though it's obviously not a Zenbook
[3981.36 --> 3982.94]  And there you go guys
[3982.94 --> 3984.72]  The Asus G750 Jay-Z
[3984.72 --> 3987.12]  Sponsor of today's episode
[3987.12 --> 3988.54]  I can't even believe you
[3988.54 --> 3990.28]  Jay-Z would have just owned his own
[3990.28 --> 3991.62]  To bring it to Victoria
[3991.62 --> 3994.62]  Yes, Jay-Z the rapper
[3994.62 --> 3998.56]  You know what's the worst part?
[3998.64 --> 4001.36]  Is I'm going to have to listen to this joke for another five weeks
[4001.36 --> 4005.40]  I'm not going to give up
[4005.40 --> 4008.34]  Speaking of jokes that lasted longer than five weeks
[4008.34 --> 4012.12]  Google Plus integration on YouTube
[4012.12 --> 4015.80]  Google has allegedly
[4015.80 --> 4017.28]  Well, no, it's happened
[4017.28 --> 4023.20]  Google has cut between 1,000 and 1,200 people
[4023.20 --> 4025.04]  Google from the Google Plus project
[4025.04 --> 4028.00]  And reassigned them to other divisions
[4028.00 --> 4033.72]  With a huge chunk of them going over to the Android side of things
[4033.72 --> 4037.84]  So that means that products like Hangouts, for example
[4037.84 --> 4039.10]  They're not being cut
[4039.10 --> 4040.60]  They're still going to exist
[4040.60 --> 4044.94]  They're just going to be less focused on Google Plus
[4044.94 --> 4047.74]  And more tightly integrated into Android
[4047.74 --> 4049.24]  Or other YouTube
[4049.24 --> 4050.90]  Or Google projects
[4050.90 --> 4052.24]  Sorry, I got YouTube on the brain
[4052.24 --> 4055.82]  So one of the reasons for this
[4055.82 --> 4058.70]  Actually, we don't have a clear idea about the reason
[4058.70 --> 4060.66]  But one of the reasons for this that I think
[4060.66 --> 4065.42]  Is just how much negativity there's been around Google Plus
[4065.42 --> 4067.12]  And how it's been forced on users
[4067.12 --> 4069.34]  It's one of the few things that Google's really done
[4069.34 --> 4072.14]  That has made literally everyone mad
[4072.14 --> 4075.10]  Like the entire internet was upset about this
[4075.10 --> 4078.08]  Google has always been really, really good at making something
[4078.08 --> 4080.24]  And then just having it exist
[4080.24 --> 4081.68]  And people find out about it
[4081.68 --> 4083.66]  And then people do their own marketing around it
[4083.66 --> 4086.06]  They've always been incredibly good at that
[4086.06 --> 4087.50]  And that might have worked for Hangouts
[4087.50 --> 4089.38]  If it wasn't such a giant piece of crap
[4089.38 --> 4091.12]  Yeah, Google Plus is terrible
[4091.12 --> 4091.50]  Hangouts is terrible
[4091.50 --> 4092.16]  Did I say Hangouts?
[4092.34 --> 4094.20]  I'm sorry, okay, no, I'm okay with
[4094.20 --> 4095.12]  Part of Hangouts is terrible
[4095.12 --> 4095.84]  I'm getting better
[4095.84 --> 4097.38]  I'm more okay with Hangouts now
[4097.38 --> 4099.26]  I still don't like the SMS integration desktop
[4099.26 --> 4101.78]  I still don't like the fact that it doesn't have a proper desktop
[4101.78 --> 4102.74]  They need to fix that
[4102.74 --> 4105.34]  I can't use it as my main thing until it's on all platforms
[4105.34 --> 4106.48]  So, okay, okay
[4106.48 --> 4107.30]  So, hold on
[4107.30 --> 4108.10]  But Google Plus
[4108.10 --> 4109.82]  Sorry, giant steaming pile of garbage
[4109.82 --> 4111.28]  I mean, honestly
[4111.28 --> 4116.42]  I'm not the best at navigating social media websites
[4116.42 --> 4118.16]  I hardly know how to use Facebook
[4118.16 --> 4119.68]  The only thing I know how to do
[4119.68 --> 4122.84]  Is to reply to people who post on my posts
[4122.84 --> 4124.38]  And post on my page
[4124.38 --> 4125.36]  Other than that
[4125.36 --> 4127.14]  I figured it all out at one point
[4127.14 --> 4130.86]  And I, like, integrated my Twitter feed
[4130.86 --> 4132.14]  And I did all this stuff
[4132.14 --> 4133.58]  And then
[4133.58 --> 4135.74]  I forgot everything
[4135.74 --> 4137.22]  Because I don't use any of that stuff
[4137.22 --> 4138.24]  Because I don't care
[4138.24 --> 4140.78]  Like, I don't care
[4140.78 --> 4144.70]  That my cousin's second nephew's
[4144.70 --> 4145.70]  Nephew's
[4145.70 --> 4146.44]  Nephew's
[4146.44 --> 4147.98]  I'm really tired
[4147.98 --> 4148.52]  I know
[4148.52 --> 4151.48]  Like, my cousin's third cousin had a birthday
[4151.48 --> 4152.98]  I don't care
[4152.98 --> 4155.16]  So, I basically don't even open it
[4155.16 --> 4157.08]  Other than to manage the Linus Tech page
[4157.08 --> 4159.08]  You can, like, filter people out of your
[4159.08 --> 4160.84]  So, I forgot how to use all that stuff
[4160.84 --> 4161.66]  Google Plus
[4161.66 --> 4163.74]  I couldn't even figure out in the first place
[4163.74 --> 4164.60]  And
[4164.60 --> 4166.58]  Not because I'm an idiot
[4166.58 --> 4169.12]  And I can't figure out how to add someone to a circle
[4169.12 --> 4170.78]  And post something that they can see
[4170.78 --> 4172.34]  What I couldn't figure out
[4172.34 --> 4174.70]  Was how to make it part of a workflow for me
[4174.70 --> 4178.66]  How to integrate it into what I'm doing on Twitter and Facebook
[4178.66 --> 4185.88]  How to manage it so that it is correctly tied to some of my YouTube channels
[4185.88 --> 4187.50]  But not my other ones
[4187.50 --> 4190.12]  And so that I can have people administering it
[4190.12 --> 4194.28]  And these are the logistical problems that I had with Google Plus
[4194.28 --> 4197.74]  The fact that it was a little bit confusing in the first place
[4197.74 --> 4199.62]  Because nothing's really labeled
[4199.62 --> 4202.98]  So, yeah, I imagine once you're a Google Plus genius
[4202.98 --> 4204.18]  It's pretty quick to navigate
[4204.18 --> 4206.98]  But nothing's really correctly labeled in the first place
[4206.98 --> 4210.26]  And second, because of Google's history
[4210.26 --> 4215.04]  Of permanently tying or untying accounts to each other
[4215.04 --> 4217.82]  And being fundamentally broken from then on
[4217.82 --> 4219.48]  I was afraid to experiment
[4219.48 --> 4221.02]  And
[4221.02 --> 4224.90]  So unless I created an entire new batch of YouTube channels
[4224.90 --> 4226.10]  An entire new Google Plus
[4226.10 --> 4228.46]  And, like, trial and errored it
[4228.46 --> 4229.66]  It just wasn't going to work
[4229.66 --> 4231.12]  And that's the problem
[4231.12 --> 4232.32]  Pretty big problem
[4232.32 --> 4233.34]  Pretty big problem
[4233.34 --> 4237.82]  If you expect a social network to work
[4237.82 --> 4239.90]  You're going to have to have influencers on it
[4239.90 --> 4242.60]  I'm already in your ecosystem, Google
[4242.60 --> 4244.60]  I'm a YouTuber, okay?
[4245.16 --> 4247.46]  And you can't manage to capture me
[4247.46 --> 4249.34]  That's a problem
[4249.34 --> 4249.90]  It's pretty bad
[4249.90 --> 4250.70]  It's terrible
[4250.70 --> 4253.32]  You know, when they first started talking about
[4253.32 --> 4255.16]  How they're going to integrate Google Plus with everything
[4255.16 --> 4256.68]  And how it's going to be this giant ecosystem
[4256.68 --> 4257.58]  I was really excited
[4257.58 --> 4258.18]  Yeah
[4258.18 --> 4259.20]  It could have been great
[4259.20 --> 4260.66]  Wow, this is bad
[4260.66 --> 4262.16]  And now I'm no longer excited
[4262.16 --> 4263.40]  It could have been amazing
[4263.40 --> 4265.22]  Should we explain why we're both tired
[4265.22 --> 4267.36]  And why laughing at your jokes hurts?
[4267.62 --> 4269.54]  It's going to have to do with the poll
[4269.54 --> 4271.22]  So let's finish up first
[4271.22 --> 4271.48]  Okay
[4271.48 --> 4272.52]  I think we kind of are
[4272.52 --> 4273.30]  We're kind of done
[4273.30 --> 4274.12]  There's a couple other things
[4274.12 --> 4275.24]  I just thought this was awesome
[4275.24 --> 4276.26]  It's posted on the forum
[4276.26 --> 4279.00]  All of Denmark has been recreated in Minecraft
[4279.00 --> 4279.64]  What?
[4279.82 --> 4280.88]  Posted by genres
[4280.88 --> 4281.54]  Now, not
[4281.54 --> 4283.20]  Okay, this has kind of been done before
[4283.20 --> 4286.08]  Like, the UK did a topographical map
[4286.08 --> 4288.12]  But no, no, no, no
[4288.12 --> 4290.00]  This is the Denmark
[4290.00 --> 4291.62]  Like, buildings and stuff
[4291.62 --> 4293.68]  So they're releasing it
[4293.68 --> 4297.12]  The only, the only things that have been changed
[4297.12 --> 4301.14]  To make it not completely sandboxed
[4301.14 --> 4302.76]  Is they have removed explosives
[4302.76 --> 4305.48]  And they have
[4305.48 --> 4306.62]  There's one other thing
[4306.62 --> 4307.76]  And all the roofs are flat
[4307.76 --> 4308.60]  That's it
[4308.60 --> 4309.84]  Other than that, it's Denmark
[4309.84 --> 4310.98]  Wow
[4310.98 --> 4311.90]  Isn't that amazing?
[4312.04 --> 4312.74]  That's pretty cool
[4312.74 --> 4313.28]  I love it
[4313.28 --> 4315.00]  I think that's fantastic
[4315.00 --> 4316.14]  That is actually really cool
[4316.14 --> 4318.38]  And then I had one other thing
[4318.38 --> 4318.84]  I think
[4318.84 --> 4319.74]  Right
[4319.74 --> 4320.90]  Okay
[4320.90 --> 4321.68]  Someone
[4321.68 --> 4322.28]  Someone
[4322.28 --> 4324.10]  Someone figure out the logistics
[4324.10 --> 4325.06]  And kickstart this
[4325.06 --> 4326.26]  I wanted to make it myself
[4326.26 --> 4326.86]  But I give up
[4326.86 --> 4327.98]  Because I just don't have time
[4327.98 --> 4329.76]  And if you can give me
[4329.76 --> 4331.18]  Like a couple bucks for the idea
[4331.18 --> 4332.54]  Then I'd appreciate that
[4332.54 --> 4333.66]  Otherwise, just make it
[4333.66 --> 4334.54]  And send me one
[4334.54 --> 4336.06]  And if you can't even manage that
[4336.06 --> 4336.74]  Then just make it
[4336.74 --> 4337.36]  And I'll buy one
[4337.36 --> 4338.40]  Because I really need this
[4338.40 --> 4340.28]  I want a smart lamp
[4340.28 --> 4340.80]  Okay
[4340.80 --> 4342.22]  Lamps
[4342.22 --> 4343.90]  The only innovation
[4343.90 --> 4344.82]  That has existed
[4344.82 --> 4346.18]  In the lamp market
[4346.18 --> 4348.00]  Has been aesthetic design
[4348.00 --> 4349.14]  And putting different kinds
[4349.14 --> 4349.92]  Of light bulbs in it
[4349.92 --> 4351.04]  What I need
[4351.04 --> 4351.96]  And someone please
[4351.96 --> 4352.76]  Make this for me
[4352.76 --> 4355.18]  Is an LED smart lamp
[4355.18 --> 4356.26]  That is
[4356.26 --> 4357.10]  That is
[4357.10 --> 4359.14]  For your devices
[4359.14 --> 4359.66]  Okay
[4359.66 --> 4360.98]  So I think
[4360.98 --> 4362.58]  Maybe the Gen 2 product
[4362.58 --> 4362.84]  Okay
[4362.84 --> 4364.26]  Maybe Gen 2 product
[4364.26 --> 4366.00]  Gets wireless charging
[4366.00 --> 4367.34]  On one of the levels
[4367.34 --> 4367.98]  But basically
[4367.98 --> 4369.06]  The way I want the smart lamp
[4369.06 --> 4369.38]  To work
[4369.38 --> 4370.20]  Is I want it to have a lamp
[4370.20 --> 4370.64]  On the top
[4370.64 --> 4371.12]  Lamp shade
[4371.12 --> 4372.24]  I want it to look pretty nice
[4372.24 --> 4373.02]  Modern aesthetic
[4373.02 --> 4374.04]  So maybe like
[4374.04 --> 4374.88]  White shade
[4374.88 --> 4375.86]  Black structure
[4375.86 --> 4376.86]  And basically
[4376.86 --> 4378.30]  I want the entire thing
[4378.30 --> 4379.58]  To be kind of shaped like this
[4379.58 --> 4380.86]  And have shelves
[4380.86 --> 4381.84]  On each level
[4381.84 --> 4383.32]  And then down one side
[4383.32 --> 4384.62]  Maybe you can turn that into
[4384.62 --> 4385.72]  Like some kind of
[4385.72 --> 4386.84]  Of a stylized thing
[4386.84 --> 4387.78]  So one side's thicker
[4387.78 --> 4389.50]  I want cable management
[4389.50 --> 4390.62]  And then
[4390.62 --> 4391.74]  I want the whole smart lamp
[4391.74 --> 4392.38]  To have one plug
[4392.38 --> 4393.36]  That goes into the wall
[4393.36 --> 4394.84]  And then maybe a base
[4394.84 --> 4396.34]  That has a whole bunch
[4396.34 --> 4397.36]  Of USB ports in it
[4397.36 --> 4398.28]  So what you can do
[4398.28 --> 4399.58]  Is on your shelves
[4399.58 --> 4401.06]  You can have little wires
[4401.06 --> 4401.62]  Coming up
[4401.62 --> 4402.42]  So that basically
[4402.42 --> 4403.16]  All you do is
[4403.16 --> 4404.74]  You can plug all of your devices
[4404.74 --> 4405.62]  Into your smart lamp
[4405.62 --> 4406.38]  So that they don't all
[4406.38 --> 4407.38]  Take up a bunch of space
[4407.38 --> 4408.08]  On your nightstand
[4408.08 --> 4409.28]  That's what I want
[4409.28 --> 4410.36]  It needs to exist
[4410.36 --> 4411.54]  It couldn't be that expensive
[4411.54 --> 4412.76]  It couldn't be that difficult
[4412.76 --> 4413.26]  To build
[4413.26 --> 4414.58]  But there is
[4414.58 --> 4416.06]  For some reason
[4416.06 --> 4417.68]  There's a crazy shortage
[4417.68 --> 4420.46]  Of multiple hub chargers
[4420.46 --> 4421.76]  Antec has one
[4421.76 --> 4422.58]  That's pretty good
[4422.58 --> 4423.48]  There's another one
[4423.48 --> 4424.38]  That's pretty good
[4424.38 --> 4425.76]  But why isn't there one
[4425.76 --> 4426.58]  That just has
[4426.58 --> 4428.30]  Like six, seven, eight ports
[4428.30 --> 4429.34]  All of which are
[4429.34 --> 4430.62]  2.1 amp capable
[4430.62 --> 4431.44]  With all the latest
[4431.44 --> 4432.22]  Charging schemes
[4432.22 --> 4433.20]  Please
[4433.20 --> 4434.66]  Someone make this for me
[4434.66 --> 4435.90]  And then follow it up
[4435.90 --> 4436.60]  With one where
[4436.60 --> 4437.32]  The bottom one
[4437.32 --> 4438.16]  Is a large wireless
[4438.16 --> 4438.96]  Charging pad
[4438.96 --> 4439.82]  And I think
[4439.82 --> 4440.96]  Each slides everywhere
[4440.96 --> 4441.64]  You might not even
[4441.64 --> 4442.62]  Have to follow it up
[4442.62 --> 4442.96]  With that
[4442.96 --> 4443.52]  That could just be
[4443.52 --> 4444.76]  Like the more expensive tier
[4444.76 --> 4446.42]  I think
[4446.42 --> 4446.88]  Because that also
[4446.88 --> 4447.64]  Doesn't sound hard
[4447.64 --> 4448.22]  To set up
[4448.22 --> 4449.24]  So yes
[4449.24 --> 4449.94]  Like at all
[4449.94 --> 4452.06]  Lamp with hub
[4452.06 --> 4453.78]  Would like it
[4453.78 --> 4454.48]  People asking
[4454.48 --> 4455.40]  What happened to my hand
[4455.40 --> 4456.44]  That actually ties in
[4456.44 --> 4457.40]  Pretty well to the next thing
[4457.40 --> 4457.64]  As well
[4457.64 --> 4458.44]  Yeah that's coming later
[4458.44 --> 4459.38]  So
[4459.38 --> 4461.54]  Do you want to
[4461.54 --> 4462.32]  Okay here
[4462.32 --> 4463.16]  Do you want to do
[4463.16 --> 4465.02]  A random.org
[4465.02 --> 4467.12]  Prize winner pick
[4467.12 --> 4468.32]  For the HTC One M8
[4468.32 --> 4469.04]  Sure
[4469.04 --> 4470.20]  What's the number range
[4470.20 --> 4470.60]  Which
[4470.60 --> 4471.36]  Oh here
[4471.36 --> 4472.00]  No no it's okay
[4472.00 --> 4472.46]  Here just
[4472.46 --> 4473.80]  Use my computer
[4473.80 --> 4475.26]  Okay
[4475.26 --> 4476.98]  I want that one
[4476.98 --> 4477.82]  Okay
[4477.82 --> 4481.02]  So just do it
[4481.02 --> 4482.18]  Do it in our standard way
[4482.18 --> 4483.36]  So random
[4483.36 --> 4483.80]  I know
[4483.80 --> 4484.42]  Random.org
[4484.42 --> 4485.28]  Random page
[4485.28 --> 4486.60]  And then random person
[4486.60 --> 4487.14]  On the page
[4487.14 --> 4488.30]  And then guys
[4488.30 --> 4489.00]  We're going to validate
[4489.00 --> 4489.62]  To make sure
[4489.62 --> 4490.96]  That you haven't posted twice
[4490.96 --> 4492.08]  Do we know how many pages
[4492.08 --> 4492.50]  There are
[4492.50 --> 4493.12]  Yes we do
[4493.12 --> 4493.74]  On the forum
[4493.74 --> 4494.44]  We know how many pages
[4494.44 --> 4496.10]  490
[4496.10 --> 4496.90]  I know
[4496.90 --> 4497.90]  We got a lot of entrance
[4497.90 --> 4499.90]  Oh no
[4499.90 --> 4501.80]  And HTC has confirmed
[4501.80 --> 4502.56]  They were super nice
[4502.56 --> 4503.14]  About it
[4503.14 --> 4503.50]  Again
[4503.50 --> 4504.10]  Not
[4504.10 --> 4505.74]  Not reading the fine print
[4505.74 --> 4506.40]  For giveaways
[4506.40 --> 4507.28]  You guys
[4507.28 --> 4508.68]  You were supposed to
[4508.68 --> 4510.04]  Click the bit.ly link
[4510.04 --> 4511.36]  That HTC gave us
[4511.36 --> 4512.14]  Yeah I'll do that
[4512.14 --> 4513.24]  You were supposed to
[4513.24 --> 4514.20]  Click the bit.ly link
[4514.20 --> 4515.32]  In order to
[4515.32 --> 4516.22]  Qualify
[4516.22 --> 4517.06]  For us to have
[4517.06 --> 4517.96]  Two phones to give away
[4517.96 --> 4518.52]  We needed to get
[4518.52 --> 4519.28]  10,000 clicks
[4519.28 --> 4520.02]  We have over
[4520.02 --> 4521.14]  10,000 entries
[4521.14 --> 4522.54]  And yet we don't have
[4522.54 --> 4523.56]  Over 10,000 clicks
[4523.56 --> 4525.40]  But HTC was super cool
[4525.40 --> 4525.84]  About it
[4525.84 --> 4526.46]  And they gave us
[4526.46 --> 4527.28]  Two phones anyway
[4527.28 --> 4528.20]  So what are terms
[4528.20 --> 4528.68]  They just have to
[4528.68 --> 4529.56]  Post in here at all
[4529.56 --> 4530.38]  They have to post in here
[4530.38 --> 4530.74]  At all
[4530.74 --> 4531.96]  Without double posting
[4531.96 --> 4532.58]  So
[4532.58 --> 4533.46]  So the content
[4533.46 --> 4534.54]  Of the message is not
[4534.54 --> 4534.90]  Nope

[4658.30 --> 4658.82]  I don't know
[4658.82 --> 4659.94]  I can zoom in on it
[4659.94 --> 4660.50]  No it's okay

[4676.02 --> 4676.64]  That many times
[4676.64 --> 4677.56]  20 per page
[4677.56 --> 4678.96]  Here we go
[4678.96 --> 4680.44]  Second phone winner
[4680.44 --> 4682.00]  9
[4682.00 --> 4682.46]  9
[4682.46 --> 4687.84]  I feel sorry for anyone
[4687.84 --> 4689.78]  That we're scrolling over right now
[4689.78 --> 4691.70]  5, 6, 7, 8, 9
[4691.70 --> 4694.50]  Let me recount that
[4694.50 --> 4695.06]  Just in case
[4695.06 --> 4696.08]  Because I laughed part way through
[4696.08 --> 4701.56]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
[4701.56 --> 4701.96]  Yeah okay
[4701.96 --> 4702.54]  Alright
[4702.54 --> 4702.78]  So
[4702.78 --> 4704.16]  Mmmmm
[4704.16 --> 4705.44]  8, 8, 7, 8
[4705.44 --> 4706.64]  There's an N in there
[4706.64 --> 4706.94]  Oh
[4706.94 --> 4707.38]  Okay
[4707.38 --> 4708.00]  Mmmmm
[4708.00 --> 4708.56]  Mmmmm
[4708.56 --> 4709.20]  Mmmmm
[4709.20 --> 4709.56]  Mmmmm
[4709.56 --> 4710.92]  Alright so
[4710.92 --> 4711.74]  I like the 1080p screen
[4711.74 --> 4712.52]  And build quality
[4712.52 --> 4714.44]  And battery
[4714.44 --> 4715.00]  Battery
[4715.00 --> 4715.94]  Battery
[4715.94 --> 4717.34]  Battery
[4717.34 --> 4717.66]  Yeah
[4717.66 --> 4718.08]  Battery
[4718.08 --> 4719.14]  And cameras and speakers
[4719.14 --> 4719.50]  Battery
[4719.50 --> 4720.54]  And I like the video about it
[4720.54 --> 4722.08]  So he likes everything apparently
[4722.08 --> 4723.22]  A battery is kind of like
[4723.22 --> 4723.72]  A whorehouse
[4723.72 --> 4724.90]  Where you have to take care of yourself
[4724.90 --> 4726.18]  Oh no
[4726.18 --> 4727.52]  That's horrible
[4727.52 --> 4730.00]  Wow
[4730.00 --> 4733.68]  Or a place where you
[4733.68 --> 4735.44]  You get stuff to feed fish
[4735.44 --> 4736.58]  Yeah
[4736.58 --> 4737.38]  There we go
[4737.38 --> 4737.84]  That's
[4737.84 --> 4738.20]  Yep
[4738.20 --> 4739.00]  That's it
[4739.00 --> 4739.52]  Oh
[4739.52 --> 4741.98]  These stupid
[4741.98 --> 4742.76]  Stupid
[4742.76 --> 4744.32]  High bit rate clips
[4744.32 --> 4745.92]  These aren't going to play over wireless
[4745.92 --> 4747.32]  Oh
[4747.32 --> 4748.08]  That's
[4748.08 --> 4748.60]  That's
[4748.60 --> 4750.22]  That's super unfortunate
[4750.22 --> 4750.72]  Okay
[4750.72 --> 4751.38]  Hold on a second
[4751.38 --> 4751.64]  Okay
[4751.64 --> 4752.22]  Well I'm going to
[4752.22 --> 4754.18]  I'm going to find a clip for you guys
[4754.18 --> 4755.02]  That
[4755.02 --> 4755.52]  Here
[4755.52 --> 4756.34]  Okay you know what
[4756.34 --> 4757.60]  Why don't you do like
[4757.60 --> 4758.58]  Drag that one over
[4758.58 --> 4760.08]  A Twitter blitz or something
[4760.08 --> 4761.70]  I have another topic I can talk about
[4761.70 --> 4761.96]  Do you
[4761.96 --> 4762.76]  Okay yeah yeah yeah
[4762.76 --> 4763.30]  Do a topic
[4763.30 --> 4763.68]  Do a topic
[4763.68 --> 4764.72]  Alright is this going to work
[4764.72 --> 4765.70]  Whoa
[4765.70 --> 4766.96]  Yeah that should be fun
[4766.96 --> 4767.72]  So
[4767.72 --> 4769.04]  Where is it
[4769.04 --> 4770.04]  Let me get to this
[4770.04 --> 4774.36]  BitTorrent is suggesting that Netflix should move to peer-to-peer networks
[4774.36 --> 4778.14]  Because of all the crap that's been going around right now
[4778.14 --> 4780.44]  Over people charging Netflix
[4780.44 --> 4782.10]  Like ISPs charging Netflix
[4782.10 --> 4784.16]  And ISPs charging other people for premium
[4784.16 --> 4785.64]  Bandwidth lanes
[4785.64 --> 4788.78]  And all the net neutrality issues that are happening right now
[4788.78 --> 4790.82]  That may still be resolved at some point
[4790.82 --> 4792.22]  But for now are not
[4792.22 --> 4793.12]  But for now are not
[4793.12 --> 4794.20]  So they're suggesting that
[4794.20 --> 4795.34]  Like I just said
[4795.34 --> 4797.10]  Netflix goes to a peer-to-peer network
[4797.10 --> 4799.80]  The reason why we hadn't covered this topic yet
[4799.80 --> 4802.54]  Is because I have no notes about it at all
[4802.54 --> 4805.18]  But it's been proved that this could work
[4805.18 --> 4805.56]  Yep
[4805.56 --> 4807.22]  Because of stuff like popcorn time
[4807.22 --> 4808.32]  Popcorn time is
[4808.32 --> 4810.28]  Imagine you had popcorn time
[4810.28 --> 4811.98]  But on the scale of Netflix
[4811.98 --> 4814.80]  I don't think the bandwidth issues would even have a problem
[4814.80 --> 4815.76]  Be a problem because
[4815.76 --> 4819.04]  Popcorn time seemed fast enough
[4819.04 --> 4820.50]  I never even ended up trying it
[4820.50 --> 4822.10]  But from people that I know that tried it
[4822.10 --> 4826.70]  No one had any problems watching videos in high quality
[4826.70 --> 4829.48]  So this would totally work
[4829.48 --> 4831.30]  And it actually does totally make sense
[4831.30 --> 4832.92]  It does pose a problem though
[4832.92 --> 4836.72]  As that would be like super easy
[4836.72 --> 4838.46]  As you're storing the file on your computer
[4838.46 --> 4839.12]  Right
[4839.12 --> 4841.00]  And I don't think right now with Netflix
[4841.00 --> 4843.04]  Even if you view it through a website
[4843.04 --> 4843.86]  It's just streaming
[4843.86 --> 4846.22]  You're not actually saving a temp file or anything
[4846.22 --> 4846.42]  Right?
[4846.50 --> 4846.86]  Yeah, no
[4846.86 --> 4847.76]  So
[4847.76 --> 4849.40]  Is this working fine now?
[4849.56 --> 4849.72]  Yeah
[4849.72 --> 4850.46]  Yeah, this is working
[4850.46 --> 4852.32]  Actually the solution was just to plug in wired
[4852.32 --> 4853.76]  By the way, don't gunk up the
[4853.76 --> 4854.50]  Yeah
[4854.50 --> 4855.34]  I'm already
[4855.34 --> 4856.94]  Okay, here we go
[4856.94 --> 4857.28]  So
[4857.28 --> 4858.70]  Couple of things
[4858.70 --> 4859.70]  So number one
[4859.70 --> 4861.18]  Actually before we
[4861.18 --> 4862.54]  Hold on
[4862.54 --> 4864.18]  Before we get too far into this
[4864.18 --> 4866.00]  First up is
[4866.00 --> 4866.46]  Guys
[4866.46 --> 4867.72]  We need your help
[4867.72 --> 4868.10]  Yeah
[4868.10 --> 4868.44]  Because
[4868.44 --> 4869.34]  We have
[4869.34 --> 4870.04]  Oh shoot
[4870.04 --> 4871.44]  The link is in the dock
[4871.44 --> 4873.20]  Yeah, which browser are you using?
[4873.22 --> 4873.52]  Firefox
[4873.52 --> 4874.42]  Okay, right
[4874.42 --> 4874.98]  That figures
[4874.98 --> 4876.80]  Okay, link is in the dock
[4876.80 --> 4877.10]  Okay
[4877.10 --> 4877.96]  So guys
[4877.96 --> 4879.86]  We are posting this in the
[4879.86 --> 4880.54]  Where is it?
[4880.58 --> 4880.76]  Oh
[4880.76 --> 4882.06]  I hate that
[4882.06 --> 4883.60]  How sometimes it has the drive
[4883.60 --> 4884.02]  I know
[4884.02 --> 4884.76]  Favicon
[4884.76 --> 4886.86]  And sometimes it has a little document one
[4886.86 --> 4887.60]  That's ridiculous
[4887.60 --> 4888.14]  Yep
[4888.14 --> 4888.82]  Okay
[4888.82 --> 4889.68]  So
[4889.68 --> 4891.14]  There is a problem
[4891.14 --> 4892.50]  On the internet right now
[4892.50 --> 4893.10]  The problem is a result
[4893.10 --> 4893.74]  On Twitter
[4893.74 --> 4895.34]  Where
[4895.34 --> 4897.36]  The problem
[4897.36 --> 4898.76]  Is that
[4898.76 --> 4900.08]  Here, I'm just gonna post this
[4900.08 --> 4900.42]  Guys
[4900.42 --> 4901.40]  We need y'all
[4901.40 --> 4902.68]  I posted that as Luke
[4902.68 --> 4903.68]  In the Twitch chat
[4903.68 --> 4905.42]  We need everyone to get on the Twitch chat
[4905.42 --> 4906.78]  Click that link
[4906.78 --> 4909.14]  We were actually losing
[4909.14 --> 4911.06]  This straw poll
[4911.06 --> 4912.16]  Earlier today
[4912.16 --> 4913.58]  For which
[4913.58 --> 4914.90]  Tech YouTuber
[4914.90 --> 4916.42]  Would be the last one standing
[4916.42 --> 4917.82]  In a winner takes all
[4917.82 --> 4918.94]  Free for all
[4918.94 --> 4919.40]  Fight
[4919.40 --> 4920.70]  And
[4920.70 --> 4921.54]  First of all
[4921.54 --> 4922.38]  This is a problem
[4922.38 --> 4922.94]  Because
[4922.94 --> 4924.50]  My team
[4924.50 --> 4926.30]  As of May 1st
[4926.30 --> 4927.02]  Will contain
[4927.02 --> 4927.88]  Six people
[4927.88 --> 4928.70]  So we would
[4928.70 --> 4929.84]  Obviously win
[4929.84 --> 4930.78]  Number 2
[4930.78 --> 4932.08]  Our team
[4932.08 --> 4933.32]  Has this
[4933.32 --> 4934.44]  Massive
[4934.44 --> 4935.02]  Hulk
[4935.02 --> 4935.96]  Of a warrior
[4935.96 --> 4936.68]  Specimen
[4936.68 --> 4937.58]  So we would
[4937.58 --> 4938.64]  Obviously win
[4938.64 --> 4940.36]  So I need you guys
[4940.36 --> 4941.48]  To take care
[4941.48 --> 4942.70]  Of this poll
[4942.70 --> 4943.70]  Because
[4943.70 --> 4946.10]  And if you're on the fence
[4946.10 --> 4947.12]  If you've already voted
[4947.12 --> 4947.90]  For someone else
[4947.90 --> 4949.06]  Or if you're on the fence
[4949.06 --> 4950.00]  About voting at all
[4950.00 --> 4951.80]  What I need for you guys
[4951.80 --> 4952.80]  Is to
[4952.80 --> 4953.46]  Here I'm just gonna
[4953.46 --> 4954.50]  I'm gonna keep posting this
[4954.50 --> 4955.08]  I need for you guys
[4955.08 --> 4955.96]  To check this out
[4955.96 --> 4956.76]  Because this
[4956.76 --> 4957.70]  Is
[4957.70 --> 4958.74]  Is from the shoot
[4958.74 --> 4960.48]  That we were on yesterday
[4960.48 --> 4962.22]  Where we were dressed up
[4962.22 --> 4963.82]  And where my hands
[4963.82 --> 4964.90]  Got all covered in
[4964.90 --> 4965.98]  Black marks
[4965.98 --> 4967.34]  That I actually can't remove
[4967.34 --> 4967.64]  And
[4967.64 --> 4968.52]  The reason why
[4968.52 --> 4969.22]  Both of us are
[4969.22 --> 4970.44]  Incredibly sore today
[4970.44 --> 4971.40]  But should
[4971.40 --> 4972.74]  Tip you over the edge
[4972.74 --> 4973.58]  And help us
[4973.58 --> 4975.60]  Secure your vote
[4975.60 --> 4976.74]  So if you wanna
[4976.74 --> 4977.80]  Just keep posting the
[4977.80 --> 4978.90]  Yeah you handle that
[4978.90 --> 4980.28]  While I show them
[4980.28 --> 4981.70]  What went on
[4981.70 --> 4982.28]  Yesterday
[4982.28 --> 4983.72]  So first I'll give you guys
[4983.72 --> 4985.06]  The view from a distance here
[4985.06 --> 4986.74]  Alright so
[4986.74 --> 4987.82]  Did you watch this one already?
[4987.92 --> 4988.74]  I haven't watched this one
[4988.74 --> 4989.20]  I don't know
[4989.20 --> 4989.98]  It's pretty good
[4989.98 --> 4991.22]  I don't know how
[4991.22 --> 4992.42]  How great it is
[4992.42 --> 4993.12]  So this is
[4993.12 --> 4993.94]  This is all
[4993.94 --> 4995.96]  Is this just pre-set up?
[4996.06 --> 4996.18]  Yeah
[4996.18 --> 4997.60]  Okay so pre-amble
[4997.60 --> 4998.06]  Pre-amble
[4998.06 --> 4998.52]  Here we go
[4998.52 --> 4999.46]  Start soon
[4999.46 --> 5000.46]  Okay
[5000.46 --> 5006.32]  So this is for
[5006.32 --> 5006.92]  This is for an
[5006.92 --> 5007.74]  Upcoming commercial
[5007.74 --> 5008.68]  That we're making
[5008.68 --> 5010.10]  We do that now
[5010.10 --> 5010.42]  Apparently
[5010.42 --> 5017.18]  I don't know if there's audio
[5017.18 --> 5018.40]  I don't want there to be audio
[5018.40 --> 5018.86]  Hold on
[5018.86 --> 5020.62]  I don't think there's audio
[5020.62 --> 5021.94]  Is this clip 426?
[5022.28 --> 5022.70]  I don't know
[5022.70 --> 5023.24]  Okay
[5023.24 --> 5027.20]  I don't think so
[5030.46 --> 5034.10]  I'd like to see Logan
[5034.10 --> 5034.92]  Take this on
[5034.92 --> 5039.50]  I think we go off screen
[5039.50 --> 5040.02]  On this one
[5040.02 --> 5040.92]  I'm not sure
[5040.92 --> 5041.72]  We'll see
[5041.72 --> 5044.44]  Why are they sore today?
[5055.98 --> 5057.16]  This one might not be as good
[5057.16 --> 5058.02]  As some of the other ones
[5058.02 --> 5058.70]  It's not
[5058.70 --> 5059.56]  That's why I asked you
[5059.56 --> 5060.36]  What clip number it is
[5060.36 --> 5060.78]  Oh okay
[5060.78 --> 5062.06]  I'll grab the other clip after
[5062.06 --> 5066.32]  You appear on the other side of his head
[5066.32 --> 5068.78]  Yeah that might not be the best clip
[5068.78 --> 5069.24]  It's not
[5069.24 --> 5070.64]  That was like the first one we did
[5070.64 --> 5071.38]  Oh okay
[5071.38 --> 5071.96]  Okay hold on
[5071.96 --> 5072.94]  It gets a lot better
[5072.94 --> 5074.18]  Okay let me find a better clip
[5074.18 --> 5074.76]  Hold on hold on
[5074.76 --> 5075.18]  I'll be back
[5075.18 --> 5076.06]  Anyway guys
[5076.06 --> 5076.62]  Go vote
[5076.62 --> 5077.18]  Post the link
[5077.18 --> 5077.64]  Post the link
[5077.64 --> 5078.04]  Post the link
[5078.04 --> 5078.48]  Post the link
[5078.48 --> 5080.08]  Vote for the Knights
[5080.08 --> 5081.32]  Sorry which one is it?
[5081.68 --> 5083.42]  I think it's 426
[5083.42 --> 5084.42]  426
[5084.42 --> 5086.74]  I can't verify the exact number right now
[5086.74 --> 5087.54]  And guys
[5087.54 --> 5088.54]  Let me tell you
[5088.54 --> 5091.78]  When this kind of stuff happens over and over and over again
[5091.78 --> 5093.86]  Yeah we did it many many times
[5093.86 --> 5095.34]  It becomes pretty challenging
[5095.34 --> 5098.82]  That one was missing some of the best stuff
[5098.82 --> 5099.20]  I know
[5099.20 --> 5101.30]  This one has a flying double kick
[5101.30 --> 5101.74]  And like
[5101.74 --> 5102.40]  Hold on
[5102.40 --> 5102.72]  Don't
[5102.72 --> 5103.62]  Don't spoil it
[5103.62 --> 5104.82]  I think this is the good one
[5104.82 --> 5105.38]  I'm not sure
[5105.38 --> 5110.28]  Trust me guys
[5110.28 --> 5111.24]  This was real tiring
[5111.24 --> 5118.12]  And uh
[5118.12 --> 5120.20]  So how much did your chainmail weigh?
[5121.00 --> 5121.28]  I
[5121.28 --> 5122.14]  We didn't weigh it
[5122.14 --> 5122.98]  But I'm guessing
[5122.98 --> 5123.98]  40-45 pounds
[5123.98 --> 5141.10]  Oh this is the one where I lost my helmet
[5141.10 --> 5141.70]  Yeah
[5141.70 --> 5143.78]  Or one of the ones where I lost my helmet
[5143.78 --> 5144.58]  The helmet
[5144.58 --> 5145.62]  In spite of being
[5145.62 --> 5146.86]  Not that strong
[5146.86 --> 5148.48]  Actually helped a little bit
[5148.48 --> 5156.72]  Yeah there you go
[5156.72 --> 5157.44]  Alright alright
[5157.44 --> 5157.86]  Hold on
[5157.86 --> 5158.64]  The like
[5158.64 --> 5160.28]  Close up awesomeness is
[5160.28 --> 5161.44]  Yeah there's one more clip
[5161.44 --> 5163.22]  We don't have any of the slow mo
[5163.22 --> 5163.74]  You guys
[5163.74 --> 5164.12]  Yeah
[5164.12 --> 5165.62]  Cause we captured that in Raw
[5165.62 --> 5166.12]  Yeah
[5166.12 --> 5167.56]  So unfortunately
[5167.56 --> 5169.06]  We can't share that with you
[5169.06 --> 5170.62]  But I'm gonna look for the clip
[5170.62 --> 5171.50]  Of the uh
[5171.50 --> 5172.92]  Of some of the more close up shots
[5172.92 --> 5174.72]  And then you guys will see
[5174.72 --> 5175.56]  It looks
[5175.56 --> 5177.98]  It looks interesting from that far away
[5177.98 --> 5179.32]  But up close
[5179.32 --> 5180.48]  Uh honestly
[5180.48 --> 5181.74]  Even the guys filming it
[5181.74 --> 5182.38]  So Brandon
[5182.38 --> 5183.72]  Was like
[5183.72 --> 5185.34]  Uh
[5185.34 --> 5185.98]  Okay
[5185.98 --> 5187.52]  That's a lot faster
[5187.52 --> 5189.56]  And a lot more intense
[5189.56 --> 5190.64]  When I'm right next to it
[5190.64 --> 5193.10]  He got hit once
[5193.10 --> 5195.10]  Uh what's this
[5195.10 --> 5196.00]  One one
[5196.00 --> 5196.80]  Take three
[5196.80 --> 5197.50]  Hold on
[5197.50 --> 5198.92]  Do you know what one you're looking for?
[5199.08 --> 5200.18]  Did Brandon get hit?
[5200.94 --> 5201.64]  Once yeah
[5201.64 --> 5202.16]  Did he?
[5202.26 --> 5203.00]  By my axe
[5203.00 --> 5204.02]  Really?
[5204.12 --> 5205.16]  Or wait no that was the camera
[5205.16 --> 5205.78]  Never mind yeah
[5205.78 --> 5206.20]  My bad
[5206.20 --> 5207.38]  The camera got hit once
[5207.38 --> 5209.90]  When did we do the long take?
[5211.20 --> 5212.12]  I don't know
[5212.12 --> 5213.10]  I don't remember
[5213.10 --> 5214.94]  Wasn't that near the beginning of these ones?
[5215.10 --> 5215.82]  I think so
[5215.82 --> 5216.94]  That's what I'm looking for
[5216.94 --> 5218.40]  But in the meantime
[5218.40 --> 5219.26]  Do we have any topics
[5219.26 --> 5220.42]  To keep people busy with?
[5220.44 --> 5222.10]  I don't think so
[5222.10 --> 5224.02]  There's the
[5224.02 --> 5224.52]  Uh
[5224.52 --> 5226.02]  Winners of the build blog contest
[5226.02 --> 5227.58]  But I kinda wanna go through that with you
[5227.58 --> 5229.16]  I can bring it up on this laptop though
[5229.16 --> 5229.76]  Oh okay
[5229.76 --> 5231.18]  Cool
[5231.18 --> 5233.30]  Cause we're doing the voting thing now
[5233.30 --> 5234.58]  And there's all that stuff going on
[5234.58 --> 5235.38]  Right
[5235.38 --> 5236.36]  That makes sense
[5236.36 --> 5237.84]  No
[5237.84 --> 5239.54]  I keep forgetting it's this laptop
[5239.54 --> 5240.28]  I'll be careful
[5240.28 --> 5243.12]  Okay
[5243.12 --> 5243.90]  So
[5243.90 --> 5244.86]  Build blogs
[5244.86 --> 5245.88]  I was gonna do this after
[5245.88 --> 5247.18]  So just give me a sec guys
[5247.18 --> 5248.16]  I will be ready though
[5248.16 --> 5249.42]  Um
[5249.42 --> 5250.78]  This is
[5250.78 --> 5252.40]  I hate the way that this camera
[5252.40 --> 5253.32]  It's terrible
[5253.32 --> 5255.58]  If you guys are wondering why it's taking him so long
[5255.58 --> 5258.46]  You're dancing
[5258.46 --> 5260.26]  Hey
[5260.26 --> 5261.00]  Knights danced
[5261.00 --> 5264.44]  Okay I think this is the one right?
[5265.64 --> 5266.26]  It might be
[5266.26 --> 5267.00]  How long is it?
[5267.74 --> 5268.34]  It's pretty long
[5268.34 --> 5269.28]  Very possibly
[5269.28 --> 5269.82]  Yep
[5269.82 --> 5270.42]  Okay
[5270.42 --> 5271.96]  Okay so
[5271.96 --> 5273.14]  Here you go guys
[5273.14 --> 5274.08]  Sneak preview
[5274.08 --> 5275.00]  Sneak preview
[5275.00 --> 5277.70]  So here we are up close
[5277.70 --> 5279.12]  These costumes
[5279.12 --> 5280.30]  They were cool
[5280.30 --> 5281.54]  Until it like rained
[5281.54 --> 5283.12]  And we'd been wearing them for six hours
[5283.12 --> 5283.74]  So we had
[5283.74 --> 5285.22]  We were essentially wearing towels
[5285.22 --> 5286.22]  And then under
[5286.22 --> 5287.44]  Chain and scale
[5287.44 --> 5288.66]  And then plate on top
[5288.66 --> 5293.84]  What's up?
[5294.46 --> 5294.84]  Twitch chat?
[5295.62 --> 5296.50]  I'm just curious
[5296.50 --> 5300.00]  It's gonna take a while for him to catch up
[5300.00 --> 5301.84]  Did I already do my goofy little dance?
[5303.22 --> 5303.82]  I think so
[5303.82 --> 5311.36]  I think this is just repeated slamming
[5311.36 --> 5312.50]  Oh is that all this is?
[5312.56 --> 5312.78]  Yeah
[5312.78 --> 5314.12]  Oh this is the wrong clip
[5314.12 --> 5314.68]  Well whatever
[5314.68 --> 5315.02]  Okay
[5315.02 --> 5316.24]  You guys will have to wait
[5316.24 --> 5317.96]  To see some of the crazier stuff later
[5317.96 --> 5321.06]  Stuff like that like legitimately hurt though
[5321.06 --> 5324.86]  Especially when he hits me in the face
[5324.86 --> 5327.88]  So yeah that was just us getting some clips
[5327.88 --> 5329.32]  Of like me hitting him
[5329.32 --> 5329.80]  Okay well
[5329.80 --> 5330.90]  I'm sorry guys
[5330.90 --> 5331.78]  You'll have to wait
[5331.78 --> 5333.76]  Till we actually release our commercial
[5333.76 --> 5336.82]  Something else that you guys should definitely check out
[5336.82 --> 5339.86]  Is by far the best promotional video
[5339.86 --> 5341.68]  That my team has ever made
[5341.68 --> 5343.36]  I actually had very little involvement
[5343.36 --> 5344.14]  This thing was awesome
[5344.14 --> 5344.72]  With this one
[5344.72 --> 5346.22]  But you know what
[5346.22 --> 5347.58]  Maybe we'll just play it on the stream
[5347.58 --> 5349.50]  Maybe we'll just play this one on the stream
[5349.50 --> 5351.22]  Twitch does sometimes have problems
[5351.22 --> 5352.74]  Just like streaming YouTube videos
[5352.74 --> 5353.76]  For whatever reason
[5353.76 --> 5355.58]  I don't know how that even happens
[5355.58 --> 5356.78]  But just a heads up
[5356.78 --> 5358.52]  It might work
[5358.52 --> 5359.28]  We'll see
[5359.28 --> 5360.78]  Okay well hold on a minute
[5360.78 --> 5361.44]  Let me uh
[5361.44 --> 5362.80]  Let me see if I can
[5362.80 --> 5364.20]  Where is Kingston's channel
[5364.20 --> 5364.54]  Nope
[5364.54 --> 5373.24]  So this is actually posted on Kingston's YouTube channel
[5373.24 --> 5377.86]  I think they're under Kingston Memory
[5377.86 --> 5379.50]  Or Kingston Technology
[5379.50 --> 5380.14]  There we go
[5380.14 --> 5381.34]  Alright you guys
[5381.34 --> 5382.42]  You guys should check this out
[5382.42 --> 5383.76]  Let's check this out
[5383.76 --> 5386.26]  Wait where is it
[5386.26 --> 5387.10]  They
[5387.10 --> 5388.20]  Oh that's weird
[5388.20 --> 5390.58]  They posted it on Twitter
[5390.58 --> 5393.08]  But I don't actually see it here
[5393.08 --> 5395.24]  Bizarre
[5395.24 --> 5398.24]  Um okay
[5398.24 --> 5398.64]  That is weird
[5398.64 --> 5398.66]  That is weird
[5398.66 --> 5399.74]  Because it has way more views
[5399.74 --> 5401.42]  Than like anything that's on there as well
[5401.42 --> 5402.34]  Yeah
[5402.34 --> 5403.16]  Okay
[5403.16 --> 5404.00]  Aww
[5404.00 --> 5405.42]  Well I'll tweet it out later
[5405.42 --> 5405.92]  Okay anyway
[5405.92 --> 5407.30]  You on that laptop
[5407.30 --> 5408.26]  Need to go to the forum
[5408.26 --> 5409.20]  And then to the
[5409.20 --> 5410.58]  Buildlog voting thread
[5410.58 --> 5411.46]  So
[5411.46 --> 5411.96]  Nope
[5411.96 --> 5414.36]  You're not stream screening
[5414.36 --> 5414.70]  Okay
[5414.70 --> 5416.12]  You need to change accounts
[5416.12 --> 5417.32]  I need to what?
[5417.48 --> 5418.36]  Log out of mine
[5418.36 --> 5419.44]  Oh well here
[5419.44 --> 5419.96]  Just
[5419.96 --> 5420.70]  Switch
[5420.70 --> 5421.18]  Sure
[5421.18 --> 5423.32]  We'll do the old laptop switcheroonie
[5423.32 --> 5423.96]  Here you go
[5423.96 --> 5426.20]  Whoops
[5426.20 --> 5427.64]  Oops
[5427.64 --> 5427.98]  Sorry
[5427.98 --> 5428.98]  Did I just get you in the junk?
[5429.24 --> 5429.46]  Nope
[5429.46 --> 5430.58]  It's close
[5430.58 --> 5430.96]  Again
[5430.96 --> 5432.26]  Just like the hammer
[5432.26 --> 5435.50]  Oh yeah
[5435.50 --> 5436.88]  Or was it your foot?
[5437.30 --> 5438.02]  No it was my foot
[5438.02 --> 5438.70]  Oh okay
[5438.70 --> 5439.20]  Yep
[5439.20 --> 5439.86]  Junk foot
[5439.86 --> 5440.86]  Yeah
[5440.86 --> 5441.72]  Okay so
[5441.72 --> 5443.66]  You're right now here
[5443.66 --> 5444.94]  It was Hivefire
[5444.94 --> 5445.94]  And
[5445.94 --> 5446.60]  Project
[5446.60 --> 5447.66]  Rampage
[5447.66 --> 5448.20]  That won
[5448.20 --> 5448.44]  So
[5448.44 --> 5449.10]  Hivefire
[5449.10 --> 5449.98]  Is luckily
[5449.98 --> 5450.84]  The very first one
[5450.84 --> 5451.32]  In the list
[5451.32 --> 5451.98]  Sweet
[5451.98 --> 5452.80]  Wow
[5452.80 --> 5453.74]  Look at that thing
[5453.74 --> 5455.68]  I haven't even seen this yet
[5455.68 --> 5456.20]  Pretty ridiculous
[5456.20 --> 5456.70]  We haven't done
[5456.70 --> 5457.52]  Buildlogs of the week
[5457.52 --> 5458.30]  In a long time
[5458.30 --> 5458.68]  It is now
[5458.68 --> 5459.50]  Buildlogs of the month
[5459.50 --> 5460.22]  Of the month
[5460.22 --> 5462.02]  That is of the month
[5462.02 --> 5463.88]  This is part of the reason
[5463.88 --> 5464.32]  Why we made it
[5464.32 --> 5464.84]  Buildlogs of the month
[5464.84 --> 5465.60]  Unfortunately
[5465.60 --> 5466.60]  Last time I checked
[5466.60 --> 5467.30]  I don't know if it's still
[5467.30 --> 5468.00]  This way or not
[5468.00 --> 5468.38]  But
[5468.38 --> 5469.30]  The
[5469.30 --> 5470.42]  Buildlogs
[5470.42 --> 5471.04]  Actually
[5471.04 --> 5472.56]  For this coming month
[5472.56 --> 5473.56]  Only had one submission
[5473.56 --> 5474.64]  So just so everyone knows
[5474.64 --> 5475.50]  If you want to be on
[5475.50 --> 5476.22]  Buildlogs of the month
[5476.22 --> 5476.94]  Go to the forum
[5476.94 --> 5479.08]  And post your submission
[5479.08 --> 5479.94]  Read the rules
[5479.94 --> 5480.48]  Because
[5480.48 --> 5481.56]  For
[5481.56 --> 5482.84]  This submission
[5482.84 --> 5483.74]  Wow
[5483.74 --> 5485.22]  I let all the people through
[5485.22 --> 5486.02]  That broke the rules
[5486.02 --> 5487.00]  But for next submission
[5487.00 --> 5488.24]  I made it very clear
[5488.24 --> 5489.24]  Who did it wrong
[5489.24 --> 5490.10]  Next submission
[5490.10 --> 5490.90]  Please do it correctly
[5490.90 --> 5491.58]  And then we'll be
[5491.58 --> 5492.20]  We'll be good to go
[5492.20 --> 5492.62]  This
[5492.62 --> 5493.16]  I like
[5493.16 --> 5494.02]  Almost don't even know
[5494.02 --> 5494.50]  What to say
[5494.50 --> 5496.54]  I mean look at the details
[5496.54 --> 5497.22]  It's just crazy awesome cool
[5497.22 --> 5497.58]  Yeah
[5497.58 --> 5498.08]  I mean
[5498.08 --> 5498.62]  Everything
[5498.62 --> 5499.08]  Different colors
[5499.08 --> 5500.72]  On every dominator module
[5500.72 --> 5501.18]  Yeah
[5501.18 --> 5502.00]  I mean
[5502.00 --> 5503.58]  Coloring the accents
[5503.58 --> 5504.68]  On this motherboard
[5504.68 --> 5505.78]  Looks outstanding
[5505.78 --> 5507.54]  An insane amount of time
[5507.54 --> 5508.06]  Went into this
[5508.06 --> 5508.76]  I mean the amount
[5508.76 --> 5509.06]  The
[5509.06 --> 5510.42]  It's funny because
[5510.42 --> 5512.26]  Stuff doesn't match
[5512.26 --> 5513.34]  But it almost looks
[5513.34 --> 5514.20]  Better that way
[5514.20 --> 5514.30]  Yep
[5514.30 --> 5514.88]  Like we've got
[5514.88 --> 5515.68]  Clear tubing
[5515.68 --> 5517.06]  Braided tubing
[5517.06 --> 5518.36]  We've got
[5518.36 --> 5520.26]  Like a black and red
[5520.26 --> 5521.44]  And grey color scheme
[5521.44 --> 5521.88]  Here
[5521.88 --> 5522.70]  With black
[5522.70 --> 5523.12]  Yellow
[5523.12 --> 5523.52]  Red
[5523.52 --> 5524.00]  Orange
[5524.00 --> 5525.40]  Here
[5525.40 --> 5526.06]  And like
[5526.06 --> 5527.22]  Oh
[5527.22 --> 5527.66]  It's just
[5527.66 --> 5529.06]  It's just utter chaos
[5529.06 --> 5530.24]  It actually plays into
[5530.24 --> 5531.88]  The whole hive fire idea
[5531.88 --> 5532.72]  Because the fire's not
[5532.72 --> 5533.48]  Going to look identical
[5533.48 --> 5534.32]  All over the place
[5534.32 --> 5535.28]  That's fantastic
[5535.28 --> 5536.04]  It's really cool
[5536.04 --> 5536.56]  Alright so
[5536.56 --> 5537.46]  This wasn't a winner
[5537.46 --> 5538.32]  But we might as well
[5538.32 --> 5538.90]  These are all
[5538.90 --> 5539.92]  Crazy good
[5539.92 --> 5539.98]  Submissions
[5539.98 --> 5540.88]  Yeah for sure
[5540.88 --> 5542.94]  Do do do do do
[5542.94 --> 5544.44]  I was very obnoxious
[5544.44 --> 5544.88]  By my
[5544.88 --> 5546.02]  You broke the rules thing
[5546.02 --> 5547.30]  This was the other winner
[5547.30 --> 5548.96]  Was Project Rampage
[5548.96 --> 5549.44]  So again
[5549.44 --> 5550.32]  Check out the
[5550.32 --> 5551.36]  Check out this thread
[5551.36 --> 5551.84]  On the forum
[5551.84 --> 5552.84]  And you can click through
[5552.84 --> 5553.76]  To their individual
[5553.76 --> 5554.54]  Forum threads
[5554.54 --> 5555.42]  By doing so
[5555.42 --> 5556.32]  So you can go down
[5556.32 --> 5557.36]  To Project Rampage
[5557.36 --> 5558.14]  On this thread
[5558.14 --> 5559.02]  Click on his
[5559.02 --> 5559.62]  Link and then you'll
[5559.62 --> 5560.32]  Go to his full
[5560.32 --> 5560.78]  Build log
[5560.78 --> 5561.24]  Which will have
[5561.24 --> 5561.96]  All the pictures
[5561.96 --> 5562.78]  And all the details
[5562.78 --> 5563.48]  And all that kind of stuff
[5563.48 --> 5564.58]  These are just short snippets
[5564.58 --> 5565.16]  Look at this
[5565.16 --> 5566.18]  Bent tubing
[5566.18 --> 5567.52]  Oh man
[5567.52 --> 5568.40]  I love that
[5568.40 --> 5569.22]  It looks really good
[5569.22 --> 5570.16]  That looks clean
[5570.16 --> 5571.24]  I mean I'm not
[5571.24 --> 5573.44]  I'm not much of an
[5573.44 --> 5574.44]  Overdone
[5574.44 --> 5575.64]  Fittings guy
[5575.64 --> 5577.60]  And this to me
[5577.60 --> 5579.60]  Is a little bit extreme
[5579.60 --> 5580.64]  You can see how many
[5580.64 --> 5581.34]  Fittings are stacked
[5581.34 --> 5582.30]  On top of each other here
[5582.30 --> 5583.36]  I don't like
[5583.36 --> 5584.72]  Unnecessary points of failure
[5584.72 --> 5587.44]  So that's one thing
[5587.44 --> 5589.48]  But
[5589.48 --> 5591.32]  Love the aesthetic
[5591.32 --> 5592.56]  Love the way
[5592.56 --> 5593.58]  These PCI Express
[5593.58 --> 5594.60]  Connectors come in
[5594.60 --> 5596.82]  Absolutely love
[5596.82 --> 5598.06]  This bend right here
[5598.06 --> 5599.10]  Like bringing it up
[5599.10 --> 5600.30]  And then away
[5600.30 --> 5601.54]  Really breaks up
[5601.54 --> 5602.74]  That normal look
[5602.74 --> 5603.84]  Of Tri SLI
[5603.84 --> 5604.80]  Or Tri Crossfire
[5604.80 --> 5605.68]  Graphics cards
[5605.68 --> 5606.82]  With this
[5606.82 --> 5607.92]  Kind of this red line
[5607.92 --> 5608.74]  On the bottom one
[5608.74 --> 5609.96]  Looks fantastic
[5609.96 --> 5611.08]  Memory cooling
[5611.08 --> 5611.52]  Is again
[5611.52 --> 5612.14]  Something that I'm
[5612.14 --> 5613.26]  Not a huge fan of
[5613.26 --> 5613.86]  Because it's
[5613.86 --> 5614.86]  Completely unnecessary
[5614.86 --> 5616.00]  Although
[5616.00 --> 5617.90]  That G-Skill RAM
[5617.90 --> 5618.82]  That we have
[5618.82 --> 5620.06]  The 2400 megahertz
[5620.06 --> 5621.28]  64 gig kit
[5621.28 --> 5622.36]  Does benefit
[5622.36 --> 5623.34]  From active cooling
[5623.34 --> 5624.32]  So I shouldn't say
[5624.32 --> 5625.20]  Completely unnecessary
[5625.20 --> 5625.90]  Because I don't want
[5625.90 --> 5626.78]  To put fans on things
[5626.78 --> 5627.04]  Either
[5627.04 --> 5628.52]  Yeah that's true
[5628.52 --> 5629.36]  Especially if you're
[5629.36 --> 5630.04]  Doing like a crazy
[5630.04 --> 5630.66]  Water cool build
[5630.66 --> 5631.22]  You want your fans
[5631.22 --> 5632.44]  In very specific locations
[5632.44 --> 5633.70]  Fantastic builds
[5633.70 --> 5634.14]  You guys
[5634.14 --> 5634.96]  Those are amazing
[5634.96 --> 5635.94]  Absolutely awesome
[5635.94 --> 5636.52]  So I'm going to try
[5636.52 --> 5637.00]  And get something
[5637.00 --> 5637.58]  Worked out
[5637.58 --> 5639.18]  In terms of like
[5639.18 --> 5640.02]  Build of the month
[5640.02 --> 5641.08]  Badges or something
[5641.08 --> 5641.82]  We'll figure that out
[5641.82 --> 5642.62]  That's probably not
[5642.62 --> 5643.40]  Going to happen immediately
[5643.40 --> 5645.06]  But yeah
[5645.06 --> 5646.22]  The build of the
[5646.22 --> 5648.56]  Something is back
[5648.56 --> 5649.04]  We're going to be
[5649.04 --> 5649.58]  Doing another one
[5649.58 --> 5650.12]  Next month
[5650.12 --> 5650.56]  Cool
[5650.56 --> 5651.90]  And yeah
[5651.90 --> 5652.62]  Remember to go
[5652.62 --> 5653.04]  On the forum
[5653.04 --> 5653.96]  Vote and submit
[5653.96 --> 5654.58]  Oh yeah
[5654.58 --> 5655.42]  And remember to vote
[5655.42 --> 5656.40]  For us in the straw poll
[5656.40 --> 5656.82]  As well
[5656.82 --> 5657.40]  Yeah
[5657.40 --> 5658.34]  I'm going to post that
[5658.34 --> 5658.70]  In the chat
[5658.70 --> 5658.98]  Some more
[5658.98 --> 5659.24]  Yeah
[5659.24 --> 5659.98]  Hold on
[5659.98 --> 5660.84]  I'm going to post it
[5660.84 --> 5661.36]  In the chat too
[5661.36 --> 5661.72]  Guys
[5661.72 --> 5663.54]  Go vote for the knights
[5663.54 --> 5665.84]  Go vote for the PC knights
[5665.84 --> 5666.44]  Alright
[5666.44 --> 5667.56]  There's a straw poll
[5667.56 --> 5668.12]  Go vote
[5668.12 --> 5669.76]  My Twitch chat is disconnected
[5669.76 --> 5670.66]  Because
[5670.66 --> 5671.44]  Who knows
[5671.44 --> 5672.98]  Because I turned your wifi off
[5672.98 --> 5673.96]  Oh that makes sense
[5673.96 --> 5675.22]  That is everybody
[5675.22 --> 5675.66]  Go vote
[5675.66 --> 5676.14]  Go vote
[5676.14 --> 5677.46]  Am I allowed to spam
[5677.46 --> 5678.12]  My own chat
[5678.12 --> 5680.44]  I think eventually
[5680.44 --> 5681.32]  Twitch gets mad
[5681.32 --> 5681.92]  Really
[5681.92 --> 5682.70]  I think so
[5682.70 --> 5683.22]  I'm not sure
[5683.22 --> 5684.06]  Interesting
[5684.06 --> 5685.32]  We should have a look
[5685.32 --> 5686.36]  At where the results
[5686.36 --> 5686.94]  Are sitting now
[5686.94 --> 5687.48]  Oh yeah
[5687.48 --> 5688.80]  We're ahead by a solid
[5688.80 --> 5690.04]  Couple thousand now
[5690.04 --> 5690.84]  Thank you guys
[5690.84 --> 5691.72]  Thanks everyone
[5691.72 --> 5691.98]  Yeah
[5691.98 --> 5693.38]  You took care of that
[5693.38 --> 5694.98]  Stunning
[5694.98 --> 5695.94]  Abomination
[5695.94 --> 5697.38]  Of a poll
[5697.38 --> 5698.32]  Result
[5698.32 --> 5699.96]  That had us losing
[5699.96 --> 5700.64]  Alright
[5700.64 --> 5701.42]  How long did we fight
[5701.42 --> 5702.02]  For yesterday
[5702.02 --> 5702.86]  In full armor
[5702.86 --> 5703.98]  Hours
[5703.98 --> 5706.46]  Like seven hours
[5706.46 --> 5708.42]  No I think it was
[5708.42 --> 5709.40]  More like five
[5709.40 --> 5710.26]  Because we had the armor
[5710.26 --> 5710.90]  On for a while
[5710.90 --> 5711.30]  And we were just
[5711.30 --> 5712.24]  Kind of doing stuff
[5712.24 --> 5713.26]  But like you were
[5713.26 --> 5714.04]  Doing tiring things
[5714.04 --> 5714.56]  Like you moved
[5714.56 --> 5715.30]  All of our gear
[5715.30 --> 5716.08]  From the one table
[5716.08 --> 5717.54]  To the bleachers
[5717.54 --> 5718.12]  Alright
[5718.12 --> 5719.12]  Goodnight everyone
[5719.12 --> 5719.60]  Thank you for
[5719.60 --> 5720.44]  Watching the WAN show
[5720.44 --> 5721.82]  I changed my mind
[5721.82 --> 5722.64]  About garage sale
[5722.64 --> 5723.26]  Because I'm
[5723.26 --> 5724.02]  Just really tired
[5724.02 --> 5724.62]  And I want to go home
[5724.62 --> 5726.34]  Peace out
[5726.34 --> 5727.94]  Bye everyone
[5727.94 --> 5728.92]  I got to sleep
[5728.92 --> 5729.24]  Last night
[5729.24 --> 5729.68]  You didn't
[5729.68 --> 5730.14]  So that's
[5730.14 --> 5730.86]  Very justified
[5730.86 --> 5733.64]  I don't know
[5733.64 --> 5734.14]  But
[5734.14 --> 5734.74]  You have to
[5734.74 --> 5734.92]  Think about it
[5734.92 --> 5735.02]  And I know
[5735.02 --> 5736.62]  You have to
[5736.62 --> 5739.06]  Know
[5739.06 --> 5739.22]  I know
[5739.22 --> 5740.04]  I think it's
[5740.04 --> 5740.52]  That being
[5740.52 --> 5740.60]  Time
[5740.60 --> 5741.22]  Elliott
[5741.22 --> 5741.46]  fools
[5741.46 --> 5742.02]  You have to
[5742.02 --> 5743.04]  I know
[5743.04 --> 5744.24]  You have to
[5744.24 --> 5744.64]  Find it
[5744.64 --> 5744.84]  At part time
[5744.84 --> 5745.24]  You have to
[5745.24 --> 5745.78]  You have to
[5745.78 --> 5746.78]  Find it
[5746.78 --> 5747.60]  Think about it
[5747.60 --> 5748.30]  You have to
[5748.30 --> 5748.34]  I know
[5748.34 --> 5748.90]  What they are
[5748.90 --> 5749.40]  I know
[5749.40 --> 5749.44]  Yeah
[5749.44 --> 5749.88]  I know
[5749.88 --> 5750.44]  They haven't
[5750.44 --> 5750.98]  But
[5750.98 --> 5751.38]  They have to
[5751.38 --> 5751.90]  Quit
