[0.00 → 2.00] Oh, we're going to have a...
[2.00 → 3.00] Quark.
[3.00 → 4.00] Yes, thank you.
[4.00 → 7.00] A continually Christmassy Quark.
[7.00 → 12.00] Yeah, it's still Christmas here at the Lioness Media Group offices
[12.00 → 16.00] because we didn't get to spend Christmas with each other because we had a day off.
[16.00 → 21.00] Not because I thought that was a good idea, but because of laws and government...
[21.00 → 22.00] Regulations.
[22.00 → 27.00] Regulations, and apparently that's how it has to work, so everyone wasn't at the office yesterday.
[27.00 → 32.00] So we decided to continue our Christmas a little bit.
[32.00 → 36.00] That's why we have the lower third still all Christmassy, and I'm still wearing a Christmas sweater.
[36.00 → 38.00] A Zelda Christmas sweater, no less.
[38.00 → 39.00] Yup.
[39.00 → 41.00] So we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[41.00 → 43.00] Actually, we don't have a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[43.00 → 46.00] It's kind of... it's Christmas and not a lot happened.
[46.00 → 47.00] Nope.
[47.00 → 50.00] The tech industry is gearing up for CES.
[50.00 → 51.00] Pretty much.
[51.00 → 55.00] Nothing got released this week, but we'll do our best.
[55.00 → 58.00] So actually, there are a couple big news items.
[58.00 → 64.00] So hackers versus gamers, with Kim.com being Santa coming to the rescue.
[64.00 → 66.00] Not that I'm saying anything about his weight.
[66.00 → 71.00] Sony screened the interview yesterday, Christmas Day.
[71.00 → 73.00] Nothing exploded yet.
[73.00 → 77.00] You had to think about that?
[77.00 → 78.00] Well, you said yet.
[78.00 → 79.00] Oh.
[79.00 → 83.00] So I was like, uh, like it's a good thing, but like we just hope that it's going to stay up here.
[83.00 → 86.00] So it's like the like dance.
[86.00 → 87.00] Yeah.
[87.00 → 90.00] Hopefully it stays this way.
[90.00 → 91.00] Yeah.
[91.00 → 92.00] Okay.
[92.00 → 93.00] What else we got?
[93.00 → 94.00] Yeah.
[94.00 → 101.00] Um, work has rumoured, maybe, to have begun on a new Nintendo console.
[101.00 → 106.00] Um, and we're going to cover the top 10 videos from Linus Tech Tips in 2014.
[106.00 → 108.00] And the top 10 videos may surprise you.
[108.00 → 110.00] We don't actually do top 10 lists very often.
[110.00 → 112.00] We could also do the top 10 of Tech Wiki.
[112.00 → 113.00] Yes, we could.
[113.00 → 117.00] And the top 10 of Super Fun, which would be like the whole channel.
[117.00 → 118.00] The whole channel.
[118.00 → 119.00] Doesn't that have a lot of videos?
[119.00 → 123.00] Oh, we have a new Super Fun coming this week that is just going to blow your minds.
[123.00 → 124.00] I hope.
[124.00 → 125.00] Or something.
[125.00 → 126.00] Anyway.
[126.00 → 127.00] Hopefully.
[127.00 → 128.00] Intro time.
[143.00 → 144.00] Intro time.
[144.00 → 145.00] Intro time.
[145.00 → 146.00] Intro time.
[146.00 → 147.00] Intro time.
[147.00 → 148.00] Intro time.
[148.00 → 149.00] Intro time.
[149.00 → 150.00] Intro time.
[150.00 → 152.00] And our sponsors today are Lynda.com.
[152.00 → 153.00] Learn things online.
[153.00 → 154.00] And do a good job of it.
[154.00 → 155.00] Yeah.
[155.00 → 156.00] And Loot Crate.
[156.00 → 157.00] Get cool things online.
[157.00 → 158.00] And do a good job of it.
[158.00 → 159.00] Yeah.
[159.00 → 161.00] And Loot Crate.
[161.00 → 162.00] Get cool things online.
[162.00 → 164.00] And do a good job of it.
[164.00 → 166.00] Well, you mainly get them in real life.
[166.00 → 167.00] Yeah.
[167.00 → 168.00] Yes.
[168.00 → 169.00] Some of them will be digital.
[169.00 → 170.00] You sign up online.
[170.00 → 171.00] Yes.
[171.00 → 172.00] At Loot Crate.com.
[172.00 → 174.00] And hopefully, for that matter, we should go back to Lynda first.
[174.00 → 176.00] Because you actually learn in real life.
[176.00 → 177.00] Yes.
[177.00 → 178.00] But you do it online.
[178.00 → 179.00] It's like the internet.
[179.00 → 181.00] And you sign up online.
[181.00 → 182.00] It's the internet, man.
[182.00 → 183.00] At Lynda.com.
[183.00 → 185.00] And things that aren't the internet.
[185.00 → 186.00] Whoa!
[186.00 → 187.00] Holy crap!
[187.00 → 188.00] Linus Tech Tips is going to CES!
[188.00 → 189.00] How unusual!
[189.00 → 191.00] So surprising!
[191.00 → 193.00] That's the first time this has ever happened!
[193.00 → 194.00] This year.
[194.00 → 195.00] That year.
[195.00 → 196.00] That year.
[196.00 → 197.00] Yeah.
[197.00 → 198.00] Next year.
[198.00 → 199.00] In 2015.
[199.00 → 201.00] So, from January 5th to the 10th, you guys can expect to see a Fantastic.
[201.00 → 205.00] Amount of content from the International CES.
[205.00 → 208.00] And apparently, oops, apparently I called the stream the wrong thing today.
[208.00 → 210.00] I think you have to change it in dashboard.
[210.00 → 212.00] I don't think it actually changes if you do it there.
[212.00 → 213.00] Oh, for crying out loud.
[213.00 → 214.00] Yay, Twitch!
[214.00 → 215.00] I love Twitch.
[215.00 → 219.00] And we're sponsored this year by Phantom Glass.
[219.00 → 222.00] Their whole slogan is, the last screen protector you'll ever need.
[222.00 → 225.00] And what I have to say about that is, that is an outright lie.
[225.00 → 231.00] Because you probably won't keep your phone as long as you could keep your Phantom Glass screen protector.
[231.00 → 235.00] And then you will need another one for your new, different phone.
[235.00 → 238.00] The only type, the last type of screen protector you'll ever need.
[238.00 → 239.00] That could be true.
[239.00 → 241.00] So go to store.phantomglass.com to check it out.
[241.00 → 243.00] Gorilla Glass screen coverage.
[243.00 → 248.00] Unless people make like force fields, screen protectors.
[248.00 → 250.00] That would be cool.
[250.00 → 252.00] I'd be okay with that, I think.
[252.00 → 255.00] It's completely ignored.
[255.00 → 262.00] I'm changing the name of the broadcast, dang it.
[262.00 → 266.00] Alright, so what are we going to kick things off with today?
[266.00 → 269.00] I don't know man, should we just like screw it all and do the top ten last sectors videos first?
[269.00 → 271.00] Do you wanna just do that?
[271.00 → 272.00] Kinda.
[272.00 → 274.00] Just go for it.
[274.00 → 277.00] Alright, so I'm letting you guys into my dashboard here.
[277.00 → 278.00] Woah.
[278.00 → 281.00] Yeah, you guys are going to see the dashboard.
[281.00 → 282.00] So hold on a second.
[282.00 → 286.00] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[286.00 → 287.00] Alright.
[287.00 → 289.00] Here we go.
[289.00 → 293.00] So I'm going to copy this into, hopefully this will work.
[293.00 → 294.00] I have no idea.
[294.00 → 299.00] I think it'll work, but it might totally break.
[299.00 → 300.00] Oh wow.
[300.00 → 301.00] That worked a lot better than I expected.
[301.00 → 302.00] Control click to follow link.
[302.00 → 303.00] Look at that, just like that.
[303.00 → 304.00] Alright.
[304.00 → 307.00] So what I want to do is I want to make these all big.
[307.00 → 309.00] So that we can't see them all at the same time.
[309.00 → 310.00] Uh huh.
[310.00 → 311.00] Yeah.
[311.00 → 312.00] Oh wow.
[312.00 → 313.00] Totally not readable at all.
[313.00 → 314.00] That's super broken.
[314.00 → 319.00] Alright, well you'll be able to see the first two right off the bat.
[319.00 → 322.00] There's still peanut butter and jam on my face.
[322.00 → 324.00] That's not going to make sense for a while, but there is.
[324.00 → 329.00] Alright, so the most watched videos of 2014 on Linus Tech Tips.
[329.00 → 338.00] Apparently, you guys, you know, for all the people who commented on our RGB keyboard review video,
[338.00 → 346.00] about how RGB keyboards are stupid and pointless and no one should care about RGB all over their keyboards.
[346.00 → 347.00] What's that?
[347.00 → 356.00] The number of people who watched our original CES 2014 coverage of Corsair's RGB keyboard was pretty amazing.
[356.00 → 358.00] This year we had, is this going to open?
[358.00 → 359.00] What is it?
[359.00 → 360.00] What is it doing?
[360.00 → 361.00] I don't know.
[361.00 → 365.00] Why is my laptop broken?
[365.00 → 369.00] I hate you laptop.
[369.00 → 371.00] It's Christmas everyone.
[371.00 → 377.00] Oh, it's trying to open the dashboard.
[377.00 → 379.00] I see.
[379.00 → 380.00] Oh.
[380.00 → 385.00] So how am I going to open the actual video as we, videos as we go?
[385.00 → 386.00] Oh, I know.
[386.00 → 387.00] Alright.
[387.00 → 388.00] Here we go.
[388.00 → 389.00] Alright.
[389.00 → 390.00] That's a loopy way to do it.
[390.00 → 392.00] Linus's screen, so it's gonna play an ad.
[392.00 → 403.00] So 579,000 of you got to appreciate the video demoing functionality that to this day, Corsair has not quite yet actually delivered.
[403.00 → 405.00] So, some of these things work.
[405.00 → 407.00] Like that was a ripple effect that it's showing off there.
[407.00 → 413.00] Now, to be clear guys, something that we didn't tell you guys at the time, but that we did know when we were filming this,
[413.00 → 417.00] is that keyboard is just a K70.
[417.00 → 420.00] Like, it does not work at all.
[420.00 → 424.00] It doesn't even work as a keyboard anymore, if I recall correctly.
[424.00 → 425.00] Yeah.
[425.00 → 436.00] All it is, the entire inside its guts have been ripped out, and it's been replaced with the custom controller that Corsair was using to enable the lighting effects.
[436.00 → 438.00] That, like, LED light board controller.
[438.00 → 443.00] And then it has, like, I believe there are prototype Cherry MX RGB switches in it.
[443.00 → 444.00] Yeah.
[444.00 → 449.00] And it's just got, like, a pre-programmed, hard-coded series of patterns in it.
[449.00 → 450.00] It is not programmable at all.
[450.00 → 456.00] So, when people were wondering, why did it take so long for this to be released?
[456.00 → 463.00] The answer is because it wasn't ready at all when they were first showing it off.
[463.00 → 464.00] Oh, nice.
[464.00 → 465.00] So, there you go.
[465.00 → 469.00] There's our first, there's our tenth most viewed video this year.
[469.00 → 471.00] Half a million views on that one.
[471.00 → 476.00] Next up, we've got, if this page ever loads.
[476.00 → 478.00] Everyone in chat is like, old logo!
[478.00 → 480.00] Yeah, I know, right?
[480.00 → 482.00] Ah, next up.
[482.00 → 483.00] This is one, you know what?
[483.00 → 490.00] This list is almost going to end up being like a, like a favourite products of 2014.
[490.00 → 494.00] Because you guys seem to mostly agree with me about this kind of stuff.
[494.00 → 499.00] This is the LG 34UM95.
[499.00 → 506.00] And this is the monitor, when the ad is done playing, that changed my mind about the importance
[506.00 → 508.00] of 4K for now.
[508.00 → 514.00] Because 4K will matter once the scaling gets figured out by the OS makers.
[514.00 → 517.00] And not just, hey look, I'm live on Twitch.
[517.00 → 518.00] There's a little notification there.
[518.00 → 520.00] And not, and not, not just Apple.
[520.00 → 524.00] Like, Apple's already kind of got it figured out as long as they scale up proportionally.
[524.00 → 530.00] So that's one of the rumoured reasons why they went with 5K on the new iMac versus going
[530.00 → 531.00] with a 4K display.
[531.00 → 539.00] Because that way it's exactly two times the resolution of the previous 2560 by 1440 iMac.
[539.00 → 540.00] So there you go.
[540.00 → 542.00] Or four times the number of pixels.
[542.00 → 543.00] Yeah.
[543.00 → 548.00] So this, this though is, was a really, really different monitor experience.
[548.00 → 550.00] In fact, it's been an amazing year for monitors.
[550.00 → 551.00] Yes, it has, actually.
[551.00 → 553.00] This year, we've seen ultra-wide.
[553.00 → 555.00] We've seen curved.
[555.00 → 560.00] We've seen G-Sync actually get productized, even though it was announced last year.
[560.00 → 561.00] Yeah.
[561.00 → 562.00] I saw an article today.
[562.00 → 566.00] I think we're going to talk about this later on the show that, um, bloody hell, I forget
[566.00 → 572.00] who it is, but someone is sampling or someone is shipping a monitor that will be updated to
[572.00 → 573.00] Free Sync.
[573.00 → 574.00] Yama.
[574.00 → 576.00] Yama is, is shipping a monitor.
[576.00 → 579.00] It's a 28 inch 4K that will be updated to Free Sync.
[579.00 → 582.00] So Free Sync kinda came this year.
[582.00 → 585.00] It'll be a firmware update later, and you have to ship it in.
[585.00 → 586.00] So it didn't come this year.
[586.00 → 590.00] But it's, it's been an incredible, incredible year for monitors.
[590.00 → 608.00] And this one really changed the way that I used my computer by allowing me to stretch things out horizontally with no bezel in the middle and enough vertical space that it's actually usable without me, without requiring me to scale the DPI up or down in the OS.
[608.00 → 611.00] So very, very usable, very cool product.
[611.00 → 614.00] And, um, yeah, I really, really liked that one.
[614.00 → 615.00] All right.
[615.00 → 617.00] What do we get next?
[617.00 → 623.00] Oh, this one, I was not expecting this video to take off the way that it did.
[623.00 → 630.00] So this is one that we actually made last year, not this year, but this year it got, let's just
[630.00 → 638.00] have a quick look here, 587,000 views, even though it's not even a new video.
[638.00 → 640.00] So this is high speed Ram.
[640.00 → 641.00] Is it worth it?
[641.00 → 647.00] And it was a test that we ran with DDR3 all the way from 1333 to 2400 megahertz.
[647.00 → 649.00] The video has a total of 800,000 views.
[649.00 → 650.00] Crazy.
[650.00 → 651.00] Okay.
[651.00 → 652.00] We're really determined that in games.
[652.00 → 653.00] No, no, it is not.
[653.00 → 654.00] know?
[654.00 → 657.00] And it looks like a lot of people have been sharing this video around.
[657.00 → 658.00] And you know what?
[658.00 → 664.00] It's funny because every time we bring this up, it feels like it's a bit of a new revelation to a lot of people.
[664.00 → 667.44] and that's why we keep flogging this dead horse.
[667.44 → 670.12] Like that's why I did that apples to apples DDR3
[670.12 → 672.28] versus DDR4 comparison.
[672.28 → 675.08] Because it continues to not matter.
[675.08 → 678.66] In fact, DDR2 to DDR3, a lot of people who are newer
[678.66 → 682.54] to the enthusiast gaming PC game won't remember
[682.54 → 684.26] that that didn't matter either.
[684.26 → 688.44] In fact, you could go all the way back to DDR1 versus DDR2
[688.44 → 689.88] and it didn't matter then either.
[689.88 → 694.00] Now, with that said, the technology has changed since then.
[694.00 → 697.50] If we'd had quad-core or six core or even eight core
[697.50 → 700.86] extreme edition processors back when we made the transition
[700.86 → 704.62] from DDR1 to DDR2, we would have had a problem.
[704.62 → 708.20] So it's good that the RAM is making sure it stays far enough
[708.20 → 709.20] ahead of what we need.
[709.20 → 711.70] It just means that you shouldn't stress yourself out over,
[711.70 → 714.04] I have to have the latest DDR4.
[714.04 → 715.20] Yeah, yeah.
[715.20 → 718.82] It's like not a good idea to upgrade just for RAM.
[718.82 → 721.44] Wow, this one really blew me away.
[721.44 → 723.84] So this is actually the original.
[723.84 → 730.70] Now, there's no way that this video is as good as some of the build guides that we did this year.
[730.70 → 735.96] This is our ultimate build a better $2000 gaming and silent workstation PC.
[735.96 → 740.34] Actually, I think this was our second build guide that we ever did.
[740.34 → 742.20] Oh, that old intro.
[742.20 → 743.20] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[743.20 → 745.20] I remember him making that in the garage.
[745.20 → 746.20] Yeah.
[746.20 → 748.20] I remember filming this in the garage.
[748.20 → 749.20] Yeah.
[749.20 → 755.20] Something some of you might not know is the way that this is set up is actually so that you can navigate our build...
[755.20 → 759.20] Okay, well, the main menu button is apparently broken, but...
[759.20 → 766.06] The idea is that you're supposed to be able to navigate to the section that is most relevant to you at any given moment.
[766.06 → 767.42] Oh, man.
[767.42 → 767.84] Do you remember?
[767.84 → 769.98] I think we still have that Twinkle box, don't we?
[771.48 → 774.20] I don't know if it's here right now, but we do have it somewhere.
[774.22 → 774.38] Yeah, I know.
[774.44 → 774.86] It's somewhere.
[775.00 → 776.20] I think the Twinkles are gone.
[776.28 → 777.28] Oh, the Twinkles are gone.
[777.38 → 777.84] They were so...
[778.48 → 779.32] They were really gross.
[779.42 → 783.06] I threw those away this year, and we had the box for over a year.
[783.06 → 785.06] Now, something that I didn't realize...
[785.96 → 786.88] I thought Twinkles lasted forever.
[787.04 → 788.44] Yes, I believed that.
[788.68 → 793.24] And the only place I ever heard that was, like, the classic joke.
[793.32 → 795.62] There's only two things that'll survive a nuclear holocaust.
[795.86 → 796.56] Cockroaches and Twinkles.
[796.62 → 797.64] Cockroaches and Twinkles.
[797.86 → 799.16] Twinkles would not survive.
[799.34 → 799.70] No, they wouldn't.
[799.70 → 801.06] They would go mouldy, and they did.
[802.02 → 803.72] How is that possibly a saying?
[804.16 → 805.30] I don't understand.
[805.32 → 807.84] I guess no one has actually kept them long enough because they ate them?
[808.22 → 808.94] I guess so.
[809.00 → 809.78] They are disgusting.
[809.96 → 810.86] They're really not good.
[810.86 → 812.86] Yeah, they're super, super...
[812.86 → 816.30] Let's see that dude from Zombie land, and then that's, like, the only thing you want.
[816.82 → 817.56] It was a perfect movie.
[818.60 → 819.58] This one...
[819.58 → 823.36] This one blew me away as well, so you guys are probably going to be surprised by this.
[824.28 → 832.78] 830,000 views this year on the Parrot AR Drone 1 unboxing and overview.
[832.94 → 837.66] That video has a total of 2.4 million views in its lifetime.
[837.90 → 838.62] Oh, look at this.
[838.62 → 840.40] They've got an ad for the new V-box.
[840.40 → 841.22] The best possible commercial for this.
[841.32 → 842.10] I know, right?
[842.86 → 843.90] Man, they did a good job of that.
[843.96 → 846.04] I am really looking forward to checking out the Bebop.
[846.16 → 848.72] They're going to be sending us one of those in the new year sometime.
[849.06 → 849.36] Awesome.
[849.48 → 854.50] So, guys, we are definitely going to check that out for you because as cool as the AR Drone
[854.50 → 859.52] 1 is, it is nothing compared to what the Bebop is looking like.
[859.64 → 859.88] Yeah.
[859.88 → 863.98] I have no idea how this video exploded the way that it did.
[864.30 → 866.04] I didn't work particularly hard on it.
[866.04 → 866.80] You look so much younger.
[867.44 → 870.10] My wife filmed this for me in the backyard.
[870.26 → 871.56] This is from 2011.
[872.52 → 873.26] And it just...
[873.26 → 878.52] People keep watching it, even though the AR Drone V1 is, like, not interesting anymore.
[878.58 → 878.68] No.
[878.88 → 879.06] Yeah.
[879.06 → 882.84] And not a good quadcopter by today's standards at all.
[882.84 → 883.24] No.
[883.24 → 885.96] I mean, it's fun to fly around.
[886.08 → 891.70] I think we still have this one somewhere, but, like, yeah, this stuff's a lot more advanced
[891.70 → 892.94] now.
[892.94 → 898.00] Even just looking at the controller the guy has in that trailer that came on before this
[898.00 → 900.02] video for the Bebop, so much better.
[900.10 → 903.28] That's my biggest complaint, actually, about those drones is the controller, so I'm excited
[903.28 → 904.50] to try out that Bebop one.
[904.94 → 905.54] All right.
[906.04 → 908.20] So, we've got a couple more Ultimate Guides.
[908.28 → 912.00] You guys just can't get enough of these Ultimate Build Guides.
[912.22 → 915.90] One of them was one that I really expected to do well this year.
[915.90 → 920.90] That was the Ultimate Overkill Build Guide, where we built in the Corsair 900D.
[921.90 → 922.28] Oh, yeah.
[922.28 → 925.36] Yeah, that one, it's a 42-minute video.
[926.08 → 928.90] It's by far our longest build guide, I believe.
[929.38 → 934.78] And, man, that thing was a marathon filming session for me and Brandon.
[934.96 → 936.08] Like, that took forever.
[936.40 → 942.06] I still remember, in the middle of this build guide, realizing that we had already shot a
[942.06 → 948.08] significant chunk of it, with me promising that there was going to be five radiators in
[948.08 → 948.24] it.
[948.24 → 953.72] And that was when I realized, like, halfway through the build, like, I just had this moment
[953.72 → 958.30] where I just put my head in my hands when I realized that we weren't going to fit five
[958.30 → 963.28] radiators in it because I hadn't done a test fit because we were in such a hurry to do it.
[963.28 → 971.24] And you can't actually have two radiators in the basement and one in the front by default.
[971.24 → 978.32] So a couple trips to Home Depot later, I figured out how I was going to come through on that commitment.
[978.32 → 979.70] Which ended up being totally awesome.
[979.70 → 982.18] And it ended up being totally awesome.
[982.54 → 984.10] But, man, it was a nightmare.
[984.34 → 985.32] So there you go.
[986.96 → 989.52] Mid-plate mounted radiator.
[989.76 → 993.46] Two in the bottom, one in the top, one in the back, one in the mid.
[993.82 → 998.10] Empty space in the front because that was where that radiator was supposed to be.
[1000.48 → 1001.46] So awesome.
[1001.46 → 1004.08] Oh, I was so stressed.
[1004.16 → 1008.46] So that one clocked in at 878,000 views this year.
[1008.66 → 1011.20] And the ultimate build a better $1,500 PC.
[1011.46 → 1014.46] This is the original ultimate build guide.
[1014.84 → 1020.56] And it continues to get more views than most of the rest of the build guides with only the
[1020.56 → 1023.66] 4K and overkill one exceeding it.
[1023.66 → 1026.46] This one was actually...
[1026.46 → 1028.56] You guys are getting a lot of behind the scenes here.
[1028.96 → 1032.92] This one was a nightmare for its own completely different set of reasons.
[1033.34 → 1035.46] So this is back when we were filming in the garage.
[1035.64 → 1039.48] And before we even had a procedure for these at all.
[1039.90 → 1042.56] So just to give you guys some idea of what's going on.
[1042.66 → 1049.28] I'm standing on a case box in order to have enough height above our non-height adjustable table.
[1049.34 → 1051.20] We have height adjustable tables now.
[1051.30 → 1052.20] That makes a big difference.
[1052.20 → 1053.72] Boxes that you're supposed to stand on.
[1053.78 → 1053.90] Yeah.
[1053.98 → 1054.46] Case boxes.
[1054.46 → 1056.08] Like wooden boxes.
[1056.32 → 1057.16] They're called Apple boxes.
[1057.86 → 1058.10] Like...
[1058.10 → 1059.14] Okay.
[1059.52 → 1064.40] Something that had not occurred to me yet at this stage in the game was that I should
[1064.40 → 1068.82] probably assemble our build guide computers before I do a build guide.
[1069.38 → 1075.46] So nowadays, I actually build the whole thing, log everything, write a script, and then we
[1075.46 → 1075.82] film it.
[1075.90 → 1078.52] And the filming process, we can do these in like a day now.
[1079.10 → 1079.70] This one?
[1080.80 → 1081.24] Nightmare.
[1081.24 → 1085.82] It wasn't until I got to the radiator installation.
[1085.82 → 1091.26] So I've got the motherboard in, power supply in, like we're in pretty good shape.
[1091.32 → 1091.96] We're humming along.
[1092.20 → 1098.46] It wasn't until I got to the radiator installation that I realized that our H100i wasn't going to
[1098.46 → 1099.40] fit in the case.
[1100.54 → 1104.26] Now, the case has space for it.
[1104.26 → 1109.02] So the compatibility listing that I found said, yes, it works.
[1109.74 → 1110.62] And it does.
[1110.90 → 1119.18] But you have to do it this completely different like Jacky way that if I had been aware that
[1119.18 → 1123.04] that was how it was going to go down, I would have done it differently.
[1123.04 → 1126.50] Let's see if I can find the, oh right, we have a table of contents.
[1126.80 → 1127.06] Yes.
[1127.20 → 1127.90] I could just use the table.
[1127.90 → 1129.96] Teaching people how to use it, and then you don't use it.
[1130.34 → 1130.62] Okay.
[1130.70 → 1131.36] Power supply.
[1131.90 → 1132.26] Cooling.
[1132.30 → 1132.70] Here we go.
[1132.76 → 1133.16] Here we go.
[1133.64 → 1136.80] So here's, here's, okay, look at my face.
[1136.80 → 1143.12] Like, do I look like I was having a good time for the little while prior to this shot?
[1144.50 → 1145.88] Not happy Linus.
[1146.00 → 1146.72] Not good.
[1146.92 → 1148.32] It was bad news bears.
[1148.62 → 1154.22] So the way that we eventually ended up doing it was mounting it above the top of the case
[1154.22 → 1156.60] because otherwise there's not enough clearance inside.
[1156.74 → 1156.86] Yeah.
[1156.96 → 1157.10] Yeah.
[1157.28 → 1158.64] So you'll see.
[1158.74 → 1158.90] Yeah.
[1158.98 → 1159.58] So here you go.
[1159.70 → 1161.36] This is how you're supposed to do it in this case.
[1161.40 → 1162.20] I was like, really?
[1162.92 → 1164.14] You have got to be kidding me.
[1164.40 → 1165.96] Like you have got to be kidding me.
[1165.96 → 1170.90] But at this point, we're almost all the way through filming the build guide.
[1170.90 → 1173.14] You can see just how unimpressed you were right there.
[1173.36 → 1175.04] After you put it down and just your face.
[1175.26 → 1175.74] Okay, cool.
[1175.80 → 1176.08] We're done.
[1176.24 → 1179.76] I don't know what you actually said, but just like not stoked.
[1181.08 → 1182.04] That was fantastic.
[1182.58 → 1184.62] Like these continue to get a lot of views.
[1184.68 → 1185.26] And you know what?
[1185.38 → 1186.20] The old ones.
[1186.30 → 1187.98] So this one's 41 minutes long.
[1188.22 → 1192.16] Almost as long as Ultimate, even though it's just a pretty basic machine.
[1192.16 → 1197.76] People still watch these, and they still have a lot of value just because we showed a lot
[1197.76 → 1201.32] of the nitty-gritty details that we go through pretty quickly now.
[1201.50 → 1206.20] Like, you know, we talk about how, oh, it's okay to have the polarity reversed on your front
[1206.20 → 1207.00] panel switches.
[1207.58 → 1208.72] It doesn't really matter.
[1208.84 → 1209.40] It's no big deal.
[1209.40 → 1211.64] Like we went into all those little details.
[1212.22 → 1219.88] So that one delivered 833,000 views this year, which leads us into where this list gets
[1219.88 → 1222.06] a little bit random and stupid.
[1224.88 → 1232.96] Our third most popular video this year is one that was actually originally uploaded way back
[1232.96 → 1235.68] in December 2011.
[1236.24 → 1241.02] And the story behind this one is 2011.
[1241.64 → 1243.34] I've been working here for longer than I thought.
[1243.58 → 1250.88] This video, this video was done because one of the product managers at NCI, when I worked
[1250.88 → 1259.04] there at the time, told me that I had to because she had already promised to the vendor that I was
[1259.04 → 1260.86] going to do an unboxing of this thing.
[1260.86 → 1266.22] So Arctic cooling, you notice the similarity between Arctic hobby and Arctic cooling in
[1266.22 → 1270.32] the logos, Arctic cooling branched out into remote control crap.
[1271.44 → 1277.88] And so they sent an excavator for me to unbox on the show.
[1278.02 → 1281.98] And I was just like, fine, fine.
[1282.08 → 1282.28] Okay.
[1282.32 → 1285.28] If you already committed it, then fine, I'll do it.
[1285.38 → 1288.32] And it turned out they were pretty cool, which helps a lot.
[1288.42 → 1288.68] Yep.
[1288.84 → 1289.08] Yep.
[1289.08 → 1294.36] But this video, this video generated, let's have a look here.
[1294.50 → 1297.90] So it's got 2.89 million views total.
[1297.98 → 1299.16] No one even likes it.
[1299.40 → 1301.08] Like that's what blows me away about this.
[1301.16 → 1305.82] Like 945 dislikes to 3000 likes.
[1306.02 → 1308.38] No one even likes the video.
[1308.38 → 1310.70] And yet they watch it.
[1310.86 → 1314.94] So this year, that one generated 1.1 million views.
[1315.04 → 1318.88] More than almost anything that we actually produced this year.
[1318.88 → 1324.72] Really, we just need to film more things about remote control, like excavators and stuff.
[1325.16 → 1325.64] Unbelievable.
[1326.70 → 1328.26] Now, number two on the list.
[1328.36 → 1329.38] So we're almost at the end.
[1329.38 → 1335.10] Number two on the list is actually something, finally, that we legitimately filmed this year,
[1335.44 → 1338.84] worked really hard on, and is a freaking awesome video.
[1338.84 → 1344.02] This is one of my favourites of all the build guides we've ever done, the ultimate 4K build guide.
[1344.02 → 1347.94] 1.367 million views this year with 30,000 likes.
[1348.00 → 1351.78] See, this is more like the kinds of numbers for a video that's actually good.
[1352.12 → 1352.30] Yeah.
[1352.30 → 1354.96] That people legitimately wanted to watch and enjoyed.
[1356.56 → 1359.72] And this is where we really managed to cut things down on the build guide.
[1359.80 → 1362.78] So it's only 25 minutes long, even though it's still a full build guide,
[1362.78 → 1365.18] and it's got like lots of crazy editing and stuff in it.
[1365.26 → 1368.32] And yeah, this one was a lot of fun.
[1368.64 → 1371.86] Which brings us to our last one.
[1372.26 → 1375.22] Weighing in at a massive 1.8 million views.
[1375.22 → 1381.96] A full 500,000 views more than anything else, the Arctic Cooling Fire Truck Unboxing.
[1382.66 → 1388.86] Which has a total of 3.5 million views overall.
[1389.54 → 1393.18] And this was the same thing as that stupid excavator.
[1393.84 → 1397.14] It's a fire truck, and I was told I had to do it.
[1397.30 → 1398.74] Because it was already promised.
[1398.76 → 1400.62] What happened to the tank and the boat?
[1400.82 → 1402.62] The tank and the boat did okay.
[1402.62 → 1407.04] But for some reason the fire truck and the excavator just took off?
[1407.18 → 1407.36] Yeah.
[1407.68 → 1409.08] Those just took off.
[1409.74 → 1410.50] And you know what?
[1410.60 → 1413.02] Actually, did you unbox the fire truck with me?
[1413.32 → 1413.82] All of them.
[1414.08 → 1414.30] Yeah.
[1414.42 → 1416.84] Do you remember the problem we had with the fire truck?
[1417.10 → 1418.82] Where we couldn't get it to squirt water?
[1419.16 → 1419.34] Yeah.
[1419.88 → 1420.14] Yeah.
[1420.26 → 1421.46] And then we finally...
[1421.46 → 1422.60] What was...
[1422.60 → 1423.64] I don't remember what we did.
[1423.70 → 1425.70] We did some Jacky repair to it.
[1425.70 → 1425.90] Yeah.
[1426.30 → 1428.12] And then we finally got it to squirt.
[1428.12 → 1431.04] It ended up being like the most suggestive thing ever.
[1431.04 → 1433.66] When we did finally get it working.
[1436.22 → 1436.62] Yeah.
[1436.94 → 1437.34] Yeah.
[1438.46 → 1439.82] Oh, am I about to do it?
[1441.16 → 1443.00] Or is this when we figure out it doesn't work?
[1443.48 → 1445.38] This might be when we figure out it doesn't work.
[1445.66 → 1447.38] Because we did everything live before.
[1448.90 → 1449.60] Trying to shoot me.
[1449.60 → 1450.10] Here we go.
[1450.40 → 1450.54] Yeah.
[1450.62 → 1451.70] Oh, oh, yeah.
[1451.98 → 1455.64] That POV of the squirting there.
[1455.74 → 1456.02] Yeah.
[1456.22 → 1456.50] Yeah.
[1456.50 → 1456.98] Yeah.
[1457.16 → 1458.48] That's the good stuff.
[1458.98 → 1459.84] So there you go.
[1459.98 → 1466.10] There's some pretty unexpected stuff on the top video list of 2014 here.
[1466.92 → 1467.92] It's 2014, right?
[1468.26 → 1468.50] Yes.
[1468.62 → 1468.84] Yes.
[1468.94 → 1469.40] Thank goodness.
[1469.40 → 1472.60] It is soon to be 2015, but then we won't have anything on the video list.
[1474.02 → 1475.00] For very long.
[1475.22 → 1477.00] We release a video every day and then there's CES.
[1477.10 → 1478.56] So we'll have a lot of stuff really quickly.
[1478.72 → 1484.28] It really does raise the question, why do we even bother trying to make good videos when
[1484.28 → 1488.32] we can just unbox fire trucks and apparently that's all people want to see.
[1488.32 → 1489.66] That's what people really want to see anyway.
[1490.38 → 1490.88] Oh, dear.
[1491.08 → 1492.80] They want to see that fire engine sport.
[1492.80 → 1494.24] Not the like to dislike ratio though.
[1494.24 → 1495.00] Yeah.
[1495.20 → 1495.42] Yeah.
[1495.52 → 1499.32] No one actually likes it, but they just, they watch it anyway somehow.
[1499.52 → 1502.22] People in Twitch chat were like, 3000 is no one.
[1502.26 → 1503.46] And then you go to your 4K build guide.
[1503.52 → 1504.92] It's like 25K.
[1506.72 → 1507.62] Actually, yes.
[1507.90 → 1508.62] And the thing, okay.
[1508.66 → 1513.92] The thing about the no one is that most of those 3000 likes would have been right when
[1513.92 → 1516.02] that video was uploaded from the subscribers.
[1516.02 → 1516.24] Yeah.
[1516.24 → 1521.04] The subscribers, the guys that watch in the first couple of days, that's where all the
[1521.04 → 1522.22] interaction comes from.
[1522.22 → 1527.32] Like the loyal, the loyal viewers who are like ready for the new video, and they like it.
[1527.38 → 1529.74] They leave a comment, all that good stuff that helps us out a lot.
[1529.90 → 1531.04] That's when that happens.
[1531.22 → 1534.48] It's gotten almost no likes since it was first uploaded.
[1534.68 → 1534.90] Yeah.
[1535.02 → 1540.96] So it's just getting dislikes and views, which I guess is fine or something.
[1541.40 → 1541.72] Yeah.
[1542.84 → 1543.52] All right.
[1543.70 → 1548.20] So our next topic for today, I hope that was as fun for you guys as it was for me.
[1548.28 → 1550.26] I think people seem to like it in the chat and stuff.
[1550.50 → 1551.64] Reminiscing about that stuff.
[1551.64 → 1552.04] Yeah.
[1552.04 → 1556.70] I mean, the amount, the amount of crap that goes on behind the scenes here, guys, let
[1556.70 → 1560.62] me tell you, like the amount of times that stuff just doesn't work.
[1560.88 → 1563.26] Like the amount of peanut butter and jelly that's in my hair right now.
[1563.34 → 1563.60] Okay.
[1563.72 → 1564.00] Yeah.
[1564.34 → 1564.74] Yes.
[1565.24 → 1567.46] I managed to get all the peanut butter and jelly off me.
[1567.52 → 1569.76] I didn't think of checking my hair for whatever reason.
[1569.84 → 1574.12] If you guys follow us on Twitter and Instagram, there's some pretty good pictures of some jelly
[1574.12 → 1574.80] and us.
[1575.48 → 1575.80] Don't worry.
[1575.88 → 1576.44] We're clothed.
[1577.40 → 1578.24] The nudity happened.
[1578.24 → 1579.04] They probably want to.
[1579.12 → 1580.08] I'm going to go there.
[1580.14 → 1580.38] Anyway.
[1580.38 → 1580.78] Okay.
[1580.78 → 1586.00] Speaking of things not working behind the scenes, one of the biggest headaches that I had this
[1586.00 → 1590.48] entire year was doing that triple curved surround setup.
[1591.30 → 1591.32] Like.
[1591.72 → 1592.78] Oh, man.
[1593.04 → 1593.32] Yeah.
[1593.32 → 1598.40] I had some people leave some pretty critical comments about how I split that out into two
[1598.40 → 1598.80] videos.
[1599.32 → 1606.80] And my response to that would be the amount of work that went into each of those individual
[1606.80 → 1612.70] videos is more than anything but probably a build guide or anything of that calibre.
[1612.70 → 1616.54] Even then it would be like matching the build guides, not necessarily below them.
[1616.70 → 1620.92] It was a lot of work because I had to get the rig working at all.
[1620.92 → 1626.86] And that was a freaking miracle because I needed to use like a display port hub, and then I needed
[1626.86 → 1631.54] to like get that weird resolution actually working at all.
[1631.66 → 1636.74] Needed to verify that the machine was going to be able to drive that resolution at all before
[1636.74 → 1637.18] we started.
[1637.30 → 1637.42] I mean.
[1637.80 → 1638.14] Okay.
[1638.46 → 1641.60] I didn't tell you about this, but I had.
[1642.46 → 1642.94] Crap.
[1643.28 → 1645.08] It was a pretty good rig.
[1645.38 → 1649.56] Like it was an it was like a GTX 980 or something like that.
[1649.56 → 1650.82] Yes, it was a GTX 980.
[1650.92 → 1656.50] And I had Shadow of Mordor running, and it was running at like 9 FPS.
[1656.92 → 1658.50] And that game is not that demanding.
[1658.68 → 1659.12] No, it's not.
[1659.66 → 1661.02] So I realized what happened.
[1661.24 → 1663.92] I was on a 4K display, and it was running at 200%.
[1664.74 → 1665.98] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[1666.06 → 1667.68] It has built in super sampling.
[1667.86 → 1668.68] Which is actually pretty cool.
[1668.86 → 1670.12] It was running at 8K.
[1670.46 → 1670.60] Yeah.
[1670.60 → 1674.92] So that's what can happen when you do that kind of thing.
[1674.92 → 1679.26] Like when you completely overload a graphics card to the point where just communication
[1679.26 → 1680.64] internally breaks down.
[1681.14 → 1683.52] It can just turn into like a crap show.
[1683.76 → 1684.04] Just mush.
[1684.26 → 1685.70] Just completely not working.
[1685.84 → 1687.24] So I was worried that might happen.
[1687.24 → 1689.04] So that was a whole process there.
[1689.58 → 1694.08] And part two was when I had the worst headache I've had this entire year.
[1694.42 → 1698.56] I mean, worse than when we lost one of our editors for two months to a wrist injury.
[1699.04 → 1703.02] Worse than when people took a bunch of vacation during that time, and we just about died.
[1703.02 → 1707.64] You know, worse than when I was having conference calls with some of our sponsors at the end
[1707.64 → 1712.58] of that quarter when we had completely missed a bunch of our targets and like a bunch of
[1712.58 → 1713.66] the things that we committed.
[1713.94 → 1718.74] Like, yeah, you know, we're going to, you know, do a sponsor spot here and integration
[1718.74 → 1719.28] there.
[1719.32 → 1721.62] And we just like completely missed a bunch of stuff.
[1722.32 → 1726.80] Trying to get those games working at that res.
[1727.50 → 1728.50] Surround is hard.
[1729.44 → 1729.92] Okay.
[1730.82 → 1732.62] Weird aspect ratios are hard.
[1733.02 → 1737.12] You put those two things together, and you have like a list of games that you're determined
[1737.12 → 1737.82] to get working.
[1738.80 → 1740.54] And just, oh.
[1740.64 → 1741.18] It was bad.
[1741.36 → 1744.84] He had quite a few, like, didn't leave the office till 3 a.m. days.
[1745.18 → 1752.60] Nick came down to talk to me about something and like kind of was talking to me and then
[1752.60 → 1753.52] he just kind of left.
[1754.58 → 1760.74] And like the next week I actually talked to him about this, and he was just like, yeah,
[1760.74 → 1763.74] I wanted to talk to you about this, but you were working on that surround thing.
[1764.12 → 1766.86] And I was like, yeah, sorry.
[1767.16 → 1768.04] Was I rude?
[1768.24 → 1769.90] He's like, it's okay, bro.
[1769.90 → 1770.38] Yeah.
[1774.00 → 1774.32] Yeah.
[1774.32 → 1775.36] That was, yeah.
[1775.52 → 1776.78] That was an interesting time.
[1777.02 → 1778.68] Like, I hope I wasn't snappish about it.
[1778.72 → 1780.44] He's like, it's okay, bro.
[1784.94 → 1785.38] Yeah.
[1785.56 → 1785.96] Oh.
[1785.96 → 1787.00] It's all right.
[1787.08 → 1789.00] I think, yeah, everyone understands.
[1789.10 → 1789.92] There are bad days.
[1790.50 → 1795.32] I'm trying to remember what things I worked on that were really catastrophic.
[1796.38 → 1800.10] The thing that I'm working on right now was pretty catastrophic for a while.
[1800.66 → 1802.54] Oh, you know what was a perfect one for you?
[1802.92 → 1806.44] When we had to change our cooling test bench twice in a month.
[1806.44 → 1813.12] And you had to completely retest our entire back catalogue of coolers once.
[1813.62 → 1814.84] And then we had to change it again.
[1815.20 → 1820.26] So due to hardware failures and or needing that hardware for some other purpose,
[1820.78 → 1823.40] we had to tear apart the cooling test bench.
[1823.40 → 1827.00] And the problem with that is that when you tear apart a cooling test bench,
[1827.68 → 1832.06] all of your previous results are invalidated because you're testing in a closed environment.
[1832.06 → 1834.34] So if you change that motherboard, or you change that GPU,
[1834.64 → 1835.30] Something will change.
[1835.46 → 1836.88] all the previous results are different.
[1836.98 → 1840.06] And you can't just go, oh, well, we were running at this clock speed and this voltage
[1840.06 → 1845.74] because every motherboard is going to undervolt or overvolt by completely impossible to predict amount.
[1845.86 → 1846.02] Yeah.
[1847.94 → 1848.86] That was frustrating.
[1848.96 → 1853.96] And then we had, like, I had Excel crash on me and just lose everything from days worth of work.
[1853.98 → 1855.42] That's happened multiple times this year, hasn't it?
[1855.42 → 1856.12] A couple of times this year.
[1856.48 → 1859.74] There was more than once where I saved it by while it was crashing.
[1859.74 → 1862.18] I whipped my phone out real quick and took a picture of the screen
[1862.18 → 1865.46] and then was able to, like, rebuild all my data that way.
[1866.94 → 1868.84] Data loss was a pretty big issue.
[1869.56 → 1870.02] We did.
[1870.24 → 1871.36] The problems with the server.
[1871.48 → 1874.78] The server, well, the server room smoked.
[1874.96 → 1875.12] Yeah.
[1875.24 → 1877.10] We, should we just admit it?
[1877.54 → 1879.18] We still don't know what smoked.
[1880.44 → 1881.68] Everything works.
[1882.42 → 1884.54] Everything and nothing has damage on it.
[1884.54 → 1892.74] We thought it was the printer, but since that incident, we have printed, scanned with that all in one unit.
[1893.24 → 1897.96] And then my assumption was actually that it was one of the security systems.
[1898.18 → 1898.32] Yeah.
[1898.52 → 1903.44] And then the other day, Nick was like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, something, something.
[1903.54 → 1905.14] He mentioned something about monitoring.
[1905.78 → 1907.44] And I was like, oh, it still works?
[1908.04 → 1909.50] Because I had never really checked with him.
[1909.50 → 1917.34] I kind of thought, well, that's the only thing left in the room, and I don't monitor it because I assigned it to someone and then forgot about it.
[1917.66 → 1919.26] And he's like, yeah, it works.
[1919.76 → 1920.96] And so I was just like...
[1920.96 → 1922.48] So everything works?
[1922.50 → 1923.64] So what was smoking?
[1923.66 → 1925.80] There was, like, billowing smoke coming out of that room?
[1925.88 → 1927.52] That room and the next room.
[1927.58 → 1927.82] Yeah.
[1927.82 → 1935.18] And we even, like, tore apart the server a little while ago to add a PCIe SSD as a cache for the editors.
[1935.48 → 1935.58] Yeah.
[1935.76 → 1938.58] And everything's working, even all the fans.
[1939.08 → 1940.82] Nothing released Magic Blue Dust.
[1940.92 → 1942.56] I did a visual inspection of the motherboard.
[1943.26 → 1945.18] Like, we legit have...
[1945.18 → 1946.12] The UPS works.
[1946.34 → 1948.06] We have no idea what's broken.
[1948.36 → 1948.56] Yeah.
[1949.02 → 1949.18] Yeah.
[1949.24 → 1949.94] Something died.
[1949.94 → 1957.28] Oh, in forum, we moved a server, and then we moved back.
[1958.48 → 1962.90] We moved server again, and then we moved back, and then we moved server again, and then we moved somewhere else.
[1963.86 → 1966.34] Yeah, that was all within the span of, like, two weeks, right?
[1966.54 → 1966.70] Yeah.
[1968.30 → 1971.16] So every server migration is an all-nighter for him.
[1971.38 → 1975.04] Like, by default, and usually Mr. Wizard as well.
[1975.12 → 1975.82] Mr. Wizard, yes.
[1975.98 → 1976.16] Yeah.
[1976.50 → 1977.18] And Mr. Wizard.
[1978.12 → 1978.52] Oh.
[1978.52 → 1978.64] Oh.
[1978.64 → 1978.76] Oh.
[1979.92 → 1985.56] And then, like, Mr. Wizard, like, knows his Amazon stuff, and I don't know any of that.
[1985.70 → 1985.74] Right.
[1985.74 → 1986.88] So I can't even really help him.
[1987.14 → 1991.08] And then we were like, hmm, let's move to Amazon the day before the campaign.
[1991.46 → 1991.78] Yeah!
[1992.06 → 1993.42] So Mr. Wizard's like...
[1993.42 → 1994.80] Yeah, the crowdfunding campaign.
[1994.92 → 1995.22] Okay.
[1995.56 → 1999.38] Because we didn't want the site to go down during that, and we figured there was a good chance it would,
[1999.46 → 2001.40] so we, like, beefed the crap out of it.
[2001.50 → 2001.74] Yeah.
[2001.80 → 2002.40] Or so we thought.
[2002.68 → 2003.40] Or so we thought.
[2003.56 → 2004.20] And then...
[2004.20 → 2007.00] Oh, how many times this year did we lose the Raider Ring?
[2007.00 → 2008.04] Like...
[2008.04 → 2008.78] Oh, no.
[2008.86 → 2009.78] In the main server.
[2010.32 → 2010.64] Okay.
[2010.86 → 2011.20] Okay.
[2011.48 → 2012.38] Oh, you know, okay.
[2012.66 → 2014.52] Probably my second-biggest headache.
[2014.72 → 2016.26] I was so mad.
[2016.60 → 2017.84] And I wasn't mad at you.
[2018.40 → 2019.90] And I wasn't mad at me.
[2020.02 → 2020.72] I was just...
[2020.72 → 2021.78] I was just mad.
[2021.78 → 2027.20] Do you remember the time that, like, halfway through a day, you guys...
[2027.20 → 2028.16] I forget what...
[2028.16 → 2034.22] I think I contacted the office, and I was at NCI filming, and I found out...
[2034.22 → 2035.46] Like, it's like halfway through the day.
[2035.54 → 2041.08] I find out at this time that the file server hasn't been up all day.
[2041.42 → 2043.76] And I'm like, why didn't you call me?
[2043.80 → 2045.68] And Luke's like, no, I'm working on it.
[2045.68 → 2046.28] I'm working on it.
[2046.32 → 2047.72] I'm like, what's it doing?
[2047.72 → 2049.36] And he's like, oh, it just...
[2049.36 → 2053.46] It goes to, like, a post splash screen, and then it doesn't make it any further.
[2053.60 → 2055.78] I'm like, pull out those two drives.
[2055.88 → 2056.54] And he's like, what?
[2056.60 → 2057.30] How is that going to help?
[2057.32 → 2058.72] I'm like, pull out those drives.
[2058.82 → 2059.60] He's like, what?
[2059.80 → 2060.54] So he tries it.
[2060.58 → 2061.14] He pulls it out.
[2061.54 → 2062.50] Boots up just like that.
[2062.52 → 2063.92] I'm like, why didn't you call me?
[2064.08 → 2068.66] You're not going to tell me if the entire company is shut down for, like, half of a day.
[2068.66 → 2073.38] And he's like, well, you shouldn't have drives in a server that make it not post.
[2073.58 → 2075.90] And I'm like, well, yeah, but I know how it works.
[2076.12 → 2080.04] You just have to pull out those two drives, let it post, and pop them back in.
[2080.08 → 2081.50] He's like, that's stupid.
[2081.82 → 2082.62] Yes, it is.
[2083.22 → 2092.46] So basically, it's caused by an incompatibility between the two drives that I was using as a RAID 1 backup of the OS drive.
[2092.46 → 2105.08] So not actually even involved in the main RAID 6 array, but it's a compatibility between those drives and that RAID controller and that motherboard specifically.
[2105.30 → 2107.60] The drives work on the motherboard with a different RAID controller.
[2107.92 → 2110.38] The drives work on the RAID controller on a different motherboard.
[2110.76 → 2116.28] But all three of them together form a trifecta of fail and won't post.
[2116.28 → 2128.02] And so we lost half a day, half a day of productivity from the entire company because, and I was like, next time the company is not operating, call me.
[2128.70 → 2131.16] In my defence, I wasn't told at the beginning of the day.
[2131.34 → 2132.80] I didn't know until later on.
[2133.22 → 2133.60] But yes.
[2133.66 → 2134.90] Which is a whole other set of issues.
[2134.96 → 2137.76] This is why I wasn't mad at anyone specifically.
[2138.10 → 2139.84] I was just mad at everyone and everything.
[2140.84 → 2141.66] This is true.
[2141.66 → 2147.86] Should we keep talking about Linus Tech Tips stuff, or should we take a break for this and then go back to it?
[2147.86 → 2148.74] Yeah, yeah, let's take a break.
[2148.74 → 2149.04] Can you say that to me?
[2149.04 → 2150.58] Because I think there's actually more stuff too.
[2150.66 → 2150.96] I did.
[2151.10 → 2153.22] It's in the email thread for the offline doc.
[2154.24 → 2155.12] Okay, got it.
[2156.48 → 2156.82] Oh.
[2157.30 → 2157.54] Nope.
[2158.12 → 2158.72] Email thread.
[2159.14 → 2159.66] Offline.
[2159.72 → 2161.14] It doesn't say his thing.
[2161.42 → 2161.90] All right.
[2161.90 → 2175.68] So, speaking of the Linus Tech Tips crowdfunding campaign, we have, we weren't really expecting anyone to actually buy a lot of the tiers.
[2176.56 → 2176.72] Yeah.
[2176.86 → 2184.44] But our largest contributor of all time, Linus For sell from Sweden.
[2184.64 → 2185.78] By a significant amount.
[2186.06 → 2187.44] By a lot, actually.
[2187.44 → 2191.20] And a lot of you probably know him from the forum.
[2191.44 → 2192.60] Great contributor there.
[2192.70 → 2195.22] Actually did a game giveaway for December.
[2195.76 → 2196.46] Huge game giveaway.
[2196.70 → 2197.50] Huge game giveaway.
[2197.50 → 2197.86] He did the Chrome add-on.
[2198.32 → 2205.62] This is not actually related to Linus Tech Tips, but when I did my completely on the side charity stream thing, he helped out a lot with that, which was pretty cool.
[2205.90 → 2206.08] Yep.
[2206.18 → 2207.10] Totally awesome, guys.
[2207.18 → 2210.96] So, he actually bought the custom callout on the WAN show.
[2210.96 → 2219.32] So, we are going to be doing it up, and I don't know if he actually expects me to try to do this Swedish bit.
[2219.44 → 2220.76] You can go for it.
[2220.90 → 2222.14] We're not going to do it right.
[2222.30 → 2224.08] I'm sorry, anyone from Sweden, but.
[2224.14 → 2224.42] I don't know.
[2224.48 → 2226.26] Something about Allah and God.
[2226.36 → 2228.96] I don't know if that's really where I want to go on this show.
[2229.26 → 2229.50] Oh.
[2229.80 → 2230.64] No, it's not.
[2230.70 → 2231.24] It's not about.
[2231.48 → 2231.94] Yeah, no.
[2232.04 → 2232.22] It's good.
[2232.68 → 2232.96] Yes.
[2233.26 → 2234.10] And it's Swedish.
[2234.26 → 2234.66] Okay, you know what?
[2234.66 → 2235.88] You can say it in the English translation.
[2236.48 → 2237.14] Let's go with that.
[2238.18 → 2238.92] There we go.
[2238.92 → 2243.72] First and foremost, allow me to wish all of you a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year.
[2243.86 → 2244.44] There we go.
[2244.70 → 2250.78] With the tormenting of Linus and or Luke out of the way, allow me to bring you all a short message courtesy of the Tip starter 2014 campaign.
[2251.20 → 2252.76] Firstly, I hope you're enjoying the show.
[2252.84 → 2255.52] I'm pretty sure that I am, even though I'm writing this from the past.
[2256.44 → 2256.84] Woo!
[2258.36 → 2260.02] I'm allowed to be awesome like that sometimes.
[2260.20 → 2265.86] Second, I would like to take this chance to congratulate Linus, Luke, and the rest of their growing staff for their tremendous efforts this year.
[2265.86 → 2270.94] From an outsider's perspective, it can sometimes be hard to realize how much hard work goes into producing content.
[2271.36 → 2273.58] For many, it might be hard to put into perspective.
[2274.04 → 2278.08] I hope, though, that you and your members know that there are people out there that can relate,
[2278.38 → 2282.38] and for us, you guys and the hard work you put into every single production are a true source of inspiration.
[2282.94 → 2288.60] It's incredible to see how every single day, without fail, there's a new, well-produced, and often very interesting.
[2288.60 → 2295.84] I hope he means it's often very interesting, and whenever it's not, it's fascinating.
[2296.78 → 2297.96] Video to enjoy.
[2298.42 → 2304.70] Add to that the constant striving for increased production values, and one's admiration can quickly escalate out of control.
[2304.82 → 2307.66] Well, I've taken enough of everyone's valuable time, so I'll cut this short.
[2307.78 → 2311.72] LMG, keep up the good work, and I wish you all an even more successful 2015.
[2312.56 → 2313.00] Thank you.
[2313.02 → 2314.56] Best wishes, Linus For sell.
[2314.56 → 2320.10] Well, I actually, I had gone out of my way not to read it entirely until I completed on the show.
[2320.18 → 2320.88] Yeah, yeah.
[2320.90 → 2328.18] And I'm really touched, and I mean, okay, so we didn't intend for people to buy a lot of the tiers,
[2328.36 → 2331.88] and we didn't really intend for anyone to buy this, but he did.
[2331.96 → 2332.62] He did anyway.
[2332.62 → 2337.50] And so what we're going to do is we're going to throw in not only the call-out on the WAN show,
[2337.50 → 2347.46] but one of the stupid tiers that was, like, way too expensive was to name one of the rooms in the new Linus Tech Tips office.
[2348.22 → 2351.90] So unless Linus, it's so weird because I don't know a lot of Linus.
[2352.38 → 2353.94] You can call him For sell.
[2354.20 → 2354.42] Yeah.
[2354.54 → 2355.36] Just call him his last name.
[2355.40 → 2356.18] No, I'll just call him Linus.
[2356.26 → 2356.56] It's okay.
[2356.90 → 2358.14] He can be a Linus, too.
[2358.24 → 2358.40] All right.
[2358.50 → 2358.90] He earned it.
[2358.90 → 2365.68] So unless Linus tells me otherwise, we're actually planning to have, like, a small library within the new office
[2365.68 → 2369.76] where people can go to quietly write away from their desks.
[2369.96 → 2371.24] We'll have, like, kind of couches.
[2371.46 → 2373.60] So you don't have other people distracting you and whatnot.
[2373.80 → 2380.58] And so unless he wants to name something else, something else, that'll be the Linus For sell library at the Linus Media Group office.
[2380.72 → 2383.34] So we'll put up a nice little, like, plaque and stuff like that.
[2383.34 → 2390.06] So thank you very much to him and everyone else who actually contributed towards the new office campaign.
[2390.30 → 2396.54] We raised over $30,000, which is unbelievable.
[2396.84 → 2402.68] I mean, that's going to contribute a huge chunk of what it's going to cost us to do the renovations on this place
[2402.68 → 2404.10] and be able to move in smoothly.
[2404.38 → 2405.96] So thank you so much to everyone.
[2406.30 → 2406.52] Oh, yeah.
[2406.54 → 2411.92] And another thing that I wanted to throw in for Linus if he's watching is I know you're working on a project.
[2411.92 → 2415.48] I don't know how secret it is, so I'm not going to say anything about it.
[2415.54 → 2417.38] But I've had a look at some of the early assets.
[2417.96 → 2423.18] And if you'd like to, when it's ready for you to talk about it, we'd love for you to come on the show and talk about it
[2423.18 → 2428.78] because that was another tier that we didn't really intend for anyone to buy an appearance on the LAN show.
[2428.92 → 2432.00] So we'd like to offer that to you as well, have you come on and talk about it
[2432.00 → 2433.44] because it looks like it's going to be really cool.
[2433.94 → 2437.12] So Linus For sell, I've got your PM thread on the forum,
[2437.12 → 2440.66] and I'll, like, add this Linus into that as well or something,
[2440.66 → 2444.02] and we can work on figuring all the room and everything out.
[2444.98 → 2445.34] All right.
[2445.42 → 2451.00] So we're only halfway through the show, and we haven't actually done any topics yet.
[2451.22 → 2452.40] It's the last show of the year, though.
[2452.44 → 2453.58] I think it's probably fine.
[2454.36 → 2455.20] We should do it.
[2455.24 → 2456.14] There are a couple big ones.
[2456.20 → 2457.98] There's a couple huge ones that I want to hit.
[2458.12 → 2460.84] So JaggySnake57 posted this on the forum.
[2461.40 → 2464.34] Sony screened the interview on Christmas Day.
[2464.34 → 2465.26] And you know what?
[2465.70 → 2468.20] I have got to hand it to Sony.
[2468.32 → 2472.14] I mean, we, I think, I mean, it's no excuse,
[2472.48 → 2476.72] but I was pretty Missy when we were talking about this on the show last week.
[2477.28 → 2480.82] And, like, yeah, I was, like, super cranky.
[2481.02 → 2488.10] And a big part of that was I was just really upset about Sony letting terrorists win.
[2488.28 → 2488.50] Yeah.
[2488.50 → 2492.98] Because no matter what, the information that's out there is leaked.
[2493.08 → 2493.60] It's done.
[2493.76 → 2494.22] Yeah, it's over.
[2494.46 → 2494.98] It's done.
[2495.08 → 2495.42] It's over.
[2495.54 → 2496.54] There's literally nothing you can do.
[2496.56 → 2499.40] Whatever aid you will get from governmental agencies,
[2499.60 → 2503.48] whether it be U.S. or Japanese or whoever else is going to jump into Sony's aid,
[2503.78 → 2506.34] whatever's going to happen, the information is leaked.
[2506.78 → 2507.26] It's done.
[2507.26 → 2512.60] So giving in to the terrorist threat of effectively,
[2513.06 → 2516.76] I mean, they threatened to blow up theatres over screening this movie
[2516.76 → 2522.02] was a huge mistake because it just demonstrated that they had you where they wanted you.
[2522.42 → 2524.76] And so Sony came out and said,
[2524.98 → 2529.50] nope, nope, we are authorizing screenings of the interview on Christmas Day.
[2529.68 → 2531.20] It's been released on YouTube.
[2531.20 → 2536.10] So Google stepped up and supported this initiative so that the movie can be seen.
[2536.10 → 2538.70] I'm not going to watch it personally.
[2539.02 → 2539.70] I've already...
[2539.70 → 2540.80] I'm not even that interested.
[2541.02 → 2542.64] I just wanted to make sure it came out.
[2543.02 → 2547.20] I already watched the leaked Kim Jong-un death scene.
[2547.46 → 2548.10] Did you see it?
[2548.40 → 2549.24] It looks terrible.
[2549.74 → 2554.14] Like his head explodes in the cheesiest possible fashion.
[2554.36 → 2555.58] And like it's just...
[2555.58 → 2557.50] It looked very B-movie.
[2558.14 → 2559.82] Like very B-movie.
[2559.82 → 2562.96] Honestly, I've heard some people, mainly foreign members and stuff,
[2563.04 → 2566.18] say that it's like a better than average kind of thing.
[2566.26 → 2567.14] Like Dolphus comedy.
[2567.52 → 2567.76] Yeah, yeah.
[2567.92 → 2569.52] So like that's cool.
[2570.52 → 2570.88] Yeah.
[2571.30 → 2573.48] It never really interested me that much from the beginning.
[2573.64 → 2575.46] I just wanted to make sure that it actually did get released.
[2576.02 → 2576.20] Yeah.
[2576.42 → 2577.54] Because I think that's important.
[2578.12 → 2578.72] Go Sony.
[2579.06 → 2581.24] You guys did the right thing.
[2581.24 → 2583.00] I mean, I still...
[2583.00 → 2589.00] I still have no idea what the ongoing impact of Sony's business is going to be.
[2589.02 → 2589.60] Because of spoilers.
[2590.20 → 2590.94] Oh, come on.
[2590.98 → 2593.22] It's a spoiler that Kim Jong-un dies?
[2594.16 → 2595.66] It's like in the trailer.
[2598.40 → 2601.46] Actually, I don't think it is in the trailer.
[2602.20 → 2604.20] There are scenes from him...
[2604.20 → 2606.48] There are clips from his death scene in the trailer.
[2606.80 → 2608.58] But all it shows is him on a helicopter.
[2608.70 → 2610.48] We don't know that he dies there until later.
[2610.48 → 2611.16] And...
[2611.16 → 2613.48] Who cares?
[2614.08 → 2615.60] Now there's even a worse spoiler.
[2616.00 → 2616.44] The entire...
[2616.44 → 2618.58] No, the entire controversy.
[2618.58 → 2621.18] Yeah, but now people know like what the situation is.
[2621.24 → 2622.62] So now it's not even like...
[2622.62 → 2624.46] Oh, like maybe it's...
[2624.46 → 2624.72] Come on.
[2624.72 → 2626.76] Maybe he makes it out, and it gets delayed or anything.
[2626.82 → 2628.12] It's like, nope, that's it.
[2628.16 → 2633.00] The entire controversy was that Kim Jong-un dies in the movie.
[2633.20 → 2635.54] I know, but now we know the exact same position.
[2635.54 → 2636.88] That's why they got hacked.
[2637.76 → 2638.40] You know what?
[2638.40 → 2640.36] I am sorry for nothing.
[2641.46 → 2648.08] Yeah, but there's a difference between like Kim Jong-un dies, and Kim Jong-un dies in this exact specific situation.
[2649.04 → 2650.12] In this way.
[2650.54 → 2652.46] I shouldn't say I'm sorry for nothing.
[2652.58 → 2655.24] I did want to address that sort of...
[2655.24 → 2659.94] That misguided play on words during our Dollar Shave Club thing last week when I was like,
[2659.94 → 2662.26] you could have a Dollar Slave Club.
[2662.26 → 2664.20] You could have a slave delivered every week.
[2664.36 → 2665.70] That was dumb.
[2665.94 → 2667.94] I was just like, what rhymes with Dollar Shave Club?
[2668.00 → 2669.92] And the first thing that popped into my head was that.
[2670.20 → 2672.04] And I probably could have gone with like...
[2673.04 → 2674.14] Brave Club.
[2674.14 → 2676.52] Actually, that might not be any better depending on the context.
[2676.64 → 2679.44] Let's just go ahead and move on to our next topic.
[2681.28 → 2684.28] So, North Korea's internet outage.
[2684.40 → 2688.78] There actually doesn't appear to be a lot of concrete information on any of this.
[2688.86 → 2689.46] This was posted by...
[2689.46 → 2691.64] The internet has decided that it was the States.
[2692.14 → 2692.58] Yeah.
[2693.12 → 2694.42] I mean, that was the rumour.
[2694.84 → 2695.52] This was posted by...
[2695.52 → 2696.50] The internet has decided.
[2696.88 → 2698.26] Real Hilbert on the forum.
[2698.56 → 2701.88] But basically there was an internet outage for 10 hours on Monday.
[2702.20 → 2703.56] Could have been anyone.
[2706.76 → 2708.68] So, I don't know.
[2708.76 → 2710.44] Is there anything else that we can really talk...
[2710.44 → 2711.64] So, it's the worst...
[2711.64 → 2715.44] Experts called it the worst North Korean network failure in years.
[2715.44 → 2724.20] I mean, we're talking about 1,024 official actual IPv4 addresses that the country has.
[2724.40 → 2727.54] So, there wasn't a lot of internet connectivity there.
[2727.82 → 2728.22] Anyway.
[2729.06 → 2729.70] Yeah.
[2730.00 → 2734.76] There are signs that are consistent with DDoS style attacks on routers.
[2736.60 → 2739.22] They're probably running like WRT54Gs.
[2739.66 → 2740.70] So, I don't know.
[2740.70 → 2745.44] It's probably...
[2745.44 → 2745.90] I don't know.
[2747.10 → 2748.58] I mean, there was...
[2748.58 → 2750.32] I mean, just to give you guys some idea.
[2750.44 → 2752.56] Actually, you should check this out if you haven't already.
[2753.16 → 2754.66] Great article on The Verge.
[2754.74 → 2755.42] Sophie Schmidt.
[2755.56 → 2756.28] So, Eric Schmidt.
[2756.62 → 2757.54] One of Google's founders.
[2757.78 → 2758.18] Daughters.
[2758.58 → 2761.80] Actually had a chance to visit North Korea not that long ago.
[2762.20 → 2768.70] And basically described the country as kind of like a creepy Truman Show-like atmosphere.
[2768.70 → 2771.18] Here are the articles from The Verge.
[2771.20 → 2775.48] I'm still mad at them about the whole Gamer gate thing, but I'm still going to show their site here because it's a good article.
[2776.00 → 2787.30] But basically, she talked about how something like a tablet connected to the internet would be the equivalent of like, you know, the main event at an event like CES here in the West.
[2787.30 → 2791.74] Like, whatever the hottest new technology is, is like showing off internet connectivity.
[2792.16 → 2800.86] She talks about walking around in a building where people are working and saying nothing and not even looking up as people walk past.
[2800.98 → 2804.10] And just how eerie the experience was.
[2804.10 → 2805.50] It's definitely worth a read.
[2806.54 → 2819.88] Because, I mean, it's very easy for us here in nations where we have a lot more freedom than they do there to just kind of take for granted being allowed to open your mouth and say something.
[2821.08 → 2821.56] Yeah.
[2821.74 → 2823.78] Very, very interesting.
[2823.78 → 2830.36] Watching stuff like Vice Docs and stuff like that on certain countries is just, I don't know.
[2832.46 → 2833.48] Could have been worse.
[2836.02 → 2836.46] Okay.
[2836.94 → 2839.88] I had another one that I wanted to jump to from there.
[2840.24 → 2840.88] Sony Hackers?
[2840.98 → 2841.26] Yeah.
[2841.70 → 2845.78] Hackers versus gamers versus other hackers versus Kim.com versus...
[2845.78 → 2848.82] Posted by xTankSlayerX on the forum.
[2848.92 → 2850.56] Or just Tank Slayer, I think it might be.
[2850.56 → 2854.96] The original article here is from Polygon, although there's a lot of different coverage of this.
[2855.06 → 2861.28] And basically, both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live were down.
[2861.70 → 2868.74] So gamers who had just gotten brand-new PlayStation 4s and brand new Xbox Ones were not...
[2868.74 → 2869.52] Oh, I can post it.
[2869.58 → 2869.72] Sorry.
[2870.18 → 2870.52] I'm ready.
[2871.52 → 2874.28] Were not able to enjoy their brand-new consoles.
[2874.28 → 2878.36] We had people saying that, you know, they weren't even able to update...
[2878.36 → 2879.66] Oops, I'm on the wrong page now.
[2879.76 → 2879.98] Deep.
[2879.98 → 2885.20] People saying that they weren't even able to update their console, so they couldn't even play games offline.
[2885.80 → 2889.10] Just as a gigantic sort of, well, this.
[2890.28 → 2890.76] Yeah.
[2891.20 → 2893.54] Just as a gigantic this is what it appeared to be.
[2894.08 → 2898.44] So there's, I think it was, what, Lizard Squad took credit for it.
[2898.44 → 2904.10] And then Hackers Finest Squad kind of jumped in and something, something.
[2904.10 → 2909.32] And basically, the gist of it was, they said, well, no, we're not looking to disrupt the actual economy.
[2909.32 → 2914.54] If we did, we would have taken down the New York Stock Exchange or something like that.
[2914.54 → 2920.44] We just wanted to send a message to Sony and Microsoft about their digital security or something.
[2920.44 → 2927.16] You know, they probably wouldn't need it if it wasn't for douche canoes shutting down their services on purpose for no reason.
[2927.16 → 2933.28] Because the reality of it is, if you hit something hard enough, it will go down no matter what it is.
[2933.94 → 2935.36] That's how this works.
[2935.96 → 2941.14] It is, there is no such thing as a site that is completely impenetrable to an online attack.
[2941.56 → 2942.72] Google Docs was down today.
[2943.10 → 2945.02] Yeah, Google Docs was down for hours today.
[2945.18 → 2947.06] I don't know if, I don't know what it was.
[2947.10 → 2949.26] It probably wasn't an attack, but, like, stuff goes down.
[2949.36 → 2949.80] It happens.
[2950.28 → 2954.86] Anyway, um, so yeah, there's a whole, there's a whole thing.
[2955.04 → 2955.48] Blah, blah, blah.
[2955.58 → 2955.88] Two groups.
[2955.88 → 2957.60] Finest Squad stepped up.
[2957.72 → 2958.46] That's the other group.
[2958.58 → 2960.74] They're trying to, like, stop them or something.
[2960.94 → 2961.96] Yeah, so, sorry.
[2961.96 → 2963.94] So, Lizard Squad took credit for it.
[2964.36 → 2966.56] Something, something next generation Drink.
[2966.70 → 2968.84] Finest Squad emerged saying it would stop the group.
[2968.94 → 2969.70] Back and forth.
[2969.94 → 2974.76] Both groups declaimed victory through doxing, hacked Twitter accounts and websites, even an arrest.
[2974.90 → 2981.70] Finest Squad provided a link to a press release from the Sheriff's Office about the arrest of a 17-year-old in Canada in connection with the school swatting in September.
[2981.88 → 2984.02] Finest Squad began releasing names and photographs.
[2984.02 → 2988.36] Okay, doxing is never right and never cool, no matter who it is, just to be clear.
[2988.36 → 2999.26] For those of you who don't know what doxing is, that's basically fishing out the details of someone online and then publishing them somewhere extremely public, like Reddit or Twitter, for everyone to see.
[2999.82 → 3000.86] It's not cool.
[3001.10 → 3002.30] No one deserves that.
[3002.44 → 3004.50] That's not, that's not okay.
[3004.50 → 3005.18] Yeah.
[3005.18 → 3006.38] Um, yeah.
[3006.82 → 3013.58] Um, so anyway, from there, Kim.com, of all people, stepped up to the plate and-
[3013.58 → 3016.20] Really wanted to play Destiny with his friends.
[3016.20 → 3026.04] I, I give, I give Kim.com a lot more credit for shrewdness than that.
[3026.20 → 3030.74] I suspect it had less to do with wanting to play Destiny with his buddies and more to do with wanting-
[3030.74 → 3033.64] I know, it's just, it's just funny that he even said that.
[3033.86 → 3034.58] I, I, yeah.
[3034.84 → 3036.20] The guy is incredibly clever.
[3036.66 → 3038.50] Um, we have to, we have to give him that.
[3038.60 → 3042.50] He knows how to play the media like almost no one else.
[3042.58 → 3042.76] Yeah.
[3043.18 → 3043.42] Um.
[3043.42 → 3050.00] So basically, Kim.com came out and said, I have offered all the members of the hacker group.
[3050.06 → 3052.20] I think it was about 3,000 members.
[3052.40 → 3055.76] He, he, yeah, he offered them, and then they said we have 3,000 lizards.
[3055.88 → 3055.98] Yeah.
[3056.04 → 3057.92] So who knows if they actually have 3,000 members.
[3058.06 → 3059.46] They probably just want 3,000 accounts.
[3059.66 → 3060.00] Yep.
[3060.04 → 3064.02] So he offered them 3,000 free mega accounts.
[3064.18 → 3064.96] I think each of them-
[3064.96 → 3067.54] Mega management still has to approve it.
[3067.64 → 3067.86] Yes.
[3067.86 → 3072.18] It's, it's for, I think, one year, but then if they leave PlayStation and Xbox alone for that
[3072.18 → 3073.48] one year, they get upgraded to lifetime.
[3073.84 → 3075.48] Lifetime of free mega premium.
[3075.84 → 3080.66] And then basically said, look, as soon as any attacks on these networks show up, I'm taking
[3080.66 → 3081.10] it away.
[3081.46 → 3086.98] I mean, on the one hand, you know, that's a pretty nice Merry Christmas gesture from the
[3086.98 → 3091.08] the mega team and, uh, Kim.com kind of stepping up to make that happen.
[3091.08 → 3099.22] On the flip side, once again, you can't negotiate with, I mean, these groups can call themselves
[3099.22 → 3100.34] whatever they want, but.
[3100.82 → 3102.74] No, I think they're quite literally terrorists.
[3103.02 → 3106.24] If you read some of the stuff that they've been putting out there, um, these are tweets
[3106.24 → 3107.00] from Lizard Squad.
[3107.52 → 3109.58] Why DDoS the White House when you can blow it up?
[3109.66 → 3110.56] Hashtag Lizard Squad.
[3110.86 → 3112.24] Uh, the FBI failed.
[3112.40 → 3114.04] Press switch to blow them all up.
[3114.42 → 3116.60] If we threaten Barack Obama, will you try harder?
[3116.60 → 3120.84] Or FBI, uh, do a quick scan of the White House for explosives then?
[3120.96 → 3122.92] Pretty sure that's all terrorism stuff.
[3123.16 → 3127.04] Oh yeah, I've got people pointing out in Twitch that, uh, Lizard Squad did an interview with
[3127.04 → 3128.76] BBC, uh, three hours ago.
[3128.92 → 3129.86] I was aware of that.
[3129.94 → 3131.54] I haven't watched it, haven't had a chance.
[3131.72 → 3134.28] Um, quite frankly, I don't know if I should.
[3134.76 → 3137.20] Um, I don't even know if we should be talking about it.
[3137.42 → 3137.94] Probably not.
[3139.52 → 3144.00] So there, tell you what, why don't we make this our sign-off and maybe our challenge to
[3144.00 → 3145.60] any other media outlets.
[3145.60 → 3148.70] We're not going to talk about Lizard Squad or anything they do anymore.
[3149.56 → 3155.26] Because if we all stop talking about it, then, well, they'll probably just try harder
[3155.26 → 3157.70] to get our attention until eventually, in theory, they go away.
[3160.14 → 3160.54] Probably.
[3161.46 → 3162.54] Um, so...
[3162.54 → 3164.72] Applying, like, pet training rules.
[3165.48 → 3166.68] We should give them chocolates.
[3170.06 → 3170.86] Mega chocolates.
[3172.50 → 3175.24] Oh, we should probably do our sponsors, our sponsor spots.
[3175.24 → 3176.24] I'm excited.
[3176.40 → 3179.04] Yeah, our first sponsor this week is Lynda.com.
[3179.14 → 3183.14] And at some point, we're going to fix that lower third because they offer not a seven-day
[3183.14 → 3185.78] free trial, but a ten-day free trial.
[3186.10 → 3186.96] Ten days.
[3186.98 → 3188.06] Ten days.
[3188.34 → 3188.90] Lynda.com.
[3189.76 → 3190.90] Monster trucks.
[3190.90 → 3195.86] I really do wonder if anyone over at Lynda.com...
[3195.86 → 3197.68] Ten-day, ten-day, ten-day!
[3198.06 → 3203.42] Got these pictures of, like, the Lynda mascot driving monster trucks and was just like, what?
[3203.56 → 3204.82] Why is this happening?
[3205.54 → 3206.84] I'm going to see if I can find...
[3206.84 → 3208.44] Have we actually shown any of those?
[3208.52 → 3210.22] I don't think we did on this stream.
[3210.30 → 3212.86] I think we might have in the after party of whatever week that was.
[3212.86 → 3214.86] Oh, this is my favourite one anyway.
[3214.96 → 3215.34] I love it.
[3215.90 → 3216.22] That's awesome.
[3216.22 → 3223.06] So this is from our last Lynda.com spot where we were talking about, like, what if the Lynda
[3223.06 → 3226.12] mascot drove a monster truck?
[3226.20 → 3227.86] And then whoever did this...
[3227.86 → 3228.28] Who was this?
[3228.34 → 3229.46] Brandon P., I guess.
[3230.14 → 3232.56] Decorated the truck in WAN logos.
[3234.20 → 3234.68] Ridiculous.
[3234.68 → 3241.96] Anyway, Lynda.com is the place online for a very minimal monthly subscription to learn
[3241.96 → 3247.28] cool new skills, whether it's enjoying your hobby more, like digital photography, or whether
[3247.28 → 3252.72] it's something that you legitimately want to turn into a job, like video editing or coding.
[3253.02 → 3257.96] Coding is a perfect example of something on Lynda.com that can legit turn into job skills
[3257.96 → 3258.90] that you use every day.
[3259.04 → 3263.72] We have, I think it's three members here at Linus Media Group that use their Lynda.com skills.
[3263.72 → 3263.98] At least three.
[3263.98 → 3264.86] At least three.
[3265.54 → 3266.68] And, uh, so yeah.
[3266.76 → 3267.24] My mom does too.
[3267.98 → 3268.30] Really?
[3268.48 → 3269.38] She's not really a part of it.
[3269.42 → 3270.38] She, yeah, she does now.
[3270.74 → 3271.36] I didn't know that.
[3271.38 → 3272.16] She used our thing.
[3272.28 → 3272.76] Did she really?
[3272.76 → 3272.98] Yeah.
[3274.36 → 3275.22] That is awesome.
[3275.40 → 3278.34] Every once in a while she'll call me and be like, well, I want to sign up for this service,
[3278.46 → 3280.76] but like, I don't know what your URL is anymore.
[3280.86 → 3285.02] And I'm like, okay, well, you can just click on it if you go to that box on the forum.
[3285.10 → 3288.14] I'm not even just doing this so you guys know where to go.
[3288.22 → 3290.22] But like, yeah, she signed up for Lynda.com.
[3290.24 → 3290.72] That's awesome.
[3290.72 → 3293.50] And every once in a while she gets confused by the Amazon tag.
[3293.50 → 3296.44] You have to tell me, what's she, what's she, what's she learning on Lynda.com?
[3297.60 → 3299.32] Oh, this is going to be terrible because I forgot.
[3299.86 → 3300.10] Okay.
[3300.26 → 3301.18] Find out, find out.
[3301.20 → 3303.20] But she went from like homework stuff.
[3303.34 → 3303.52] Yeah.
[3303.62 → 3304.96] Like working at home kind of stuff.
[3305.26 → 3306.24] Now she's trying to get desk jobs.
[3306.32 → 3309.30] So I think she might be refreshing on like English skills and stuff like that.
[3309.42 → 3309.78] That's cool.
[3309.78 → 3312.48] Because I pushed her onto online education stuff.
[3312.58 → 3312.82] Great.
[3313.18 → 3313.90] So, yeah.
[3314.08 → 3314.60] So there you go.
[3314.66 → 3316.84] So they add new courses every week from industry experts.
[3317.50 → 3319.00] And there you go.
[3319.04 → 3319.98] Lynda.com slash WAN show.
[3320.06 → 3320.78] Try it out for free.
[3320.82 → 3323.10] And if you don't like it, then you don't have to do it anymore.
[3323.16 → 3323.46] Hi, mom.
[3323.84 → 3324.38] All right.
[3324.50 → 3326.60] We've got our, oh yes, CES.
[3326.60 → 3328.26] It's going to be a blast this year.
[3328.26 → 3333.48] We've actually got something really special planned that is going to reinforce the awesomeness
[3333.48 → 3335.00] of our sponsor, Phantom Glass.
[3335.46 → 3336.72] I am so stoked on that.
[3337.02 → 3337.94] It's going to be super fun.
[3338.28 → 3343.28] So you can watch all our coverage of the show at CES 2015 from January 5th to the 10th.
[3343.38 → 3346.82] We are going to be bringing you guys a whack ton of content.
[3347.06 → 3349.48] He's going to be all over the virtual reality stuff.
[3349.76 → 3352.32] I'm going to be all over the new parrot drone.
[3353.16 → 3356.72] He is going to be all over something, and I'm going to be all over the other stuff.
[3356.72 → 3365.20] I've got appointments with like Samsung, Sony, LG, Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, like all the usual
[3365.20 → 3365.60] suspects.
[3365.60 → 3367.02] We're going to be all over that stuff.
[3367.08 → 3367.92] It's going to be a lot of fun.
[3368.52 → 3368.96] Corsair.
[3369.28 → 3375.94] I think once again, I have, I have just like sleeved my way into the very first appointment
[3375.94 → 3377.74] for Corsair of CES.
[3378.18 → 3382.94] I did the same thing last year and I actually, I probably shouldn't tell this story, but I'm
[3382.94 → 3383.62] going to tell it anyway.
[3383.62 → 3388.76] So my Corsair contact was like, yeah, yeah, you took this spot right away.
[3389.06 → 3391.94] And I was like, yeah, I want to make sure that I'm first with whatever you guys are showing
[3391.94 → 3392.10] off.
[3392.10 → 3393.30] And they had some cool stuff last year.
[3393.36 → 3396.84] They had the 760T, and they had that little mini case.
[3396.96 → 3397.78] I forget, 230T?
[3398.50 → 3398.96] I think it's called.
[3399.20 → 3399.88] That's one of them.
[3400.06 → 3400.22] Yeah.
[3400.24 → 3401.64] They had the 230T there for sure.
[3402.20 → 3407.24] And anyway, so he's like, yeah, one of my other media contacts asked me about this spot.
[3407.24 → 3409.62] I said it was taken, and the guy was like, its Linus got it.
[3409.66 → 3410.46] Linus got it, didn't he?
[3411.10 → 3412.00] And I was just like.
[3413.46 → 3413.82] Ah.
[3415.70 → 3418.22] You have to get that, like, they used it in Star Craft a lot.
[3418.38 → 3419.78] That little, like, Shut meme thing.
[3421.84 → 3423.30] So yeah, we're going to have lots of good stuff.
[3423.52 → 3428.32] And that is going to be brought to you mostly by our gold sponsor, Phantom Glass.
[3428.32 → 3433.86] So those guys have been a big part of why we're able to take the whole team to CES this
[3433.86 → 3437.18] year and bring you guys better content than ever before from the show.
[3437.38 → 3442.02] And then our last sponsor today, we have another Loot Crate.
[3443.04 → 3445.52] So offer code Linus to save 10%.
[3445.52 → 3451.18] For those of you who didn't tune in to After Party last week, where we actually discovered
[3451.18 → 3453.78] more stuff in the Loot Crate that we didn't realize.
[3453.80 → 3454.60] Like a lot more.
[3454.60 → 3459.84] Like the entire box unfolded to become like a fight scene for like our fighting dudes.
[3459.84 → 3460.48] Drama fifty scene.
[3460.60 → 3461.80] Yeah, like pretty cool.
[3462.22 → 3466.32] So I think, I think there are actually some talking points for this.
[3466.68 → 3469.30] Well here, you do that, and I'll get into it.
[3469.34 → 3470.36] You get to open it?
[3470.42 → 3470.80] Yeah, dude.
[3470.84 → 3471.26] I hate you.
[3471.36 → 3471.64] Rex.
[3471.82 → 3477.00] So to maintain transparency, you must state that you received the crate for free from Loot Crate.
[3477.30 → 3478.88] Not that they actually cost that much.
[3478.94 → 3480.48] It's $13.37.
[3480.96 → 3481.52] What?
[3481.52 → 3484.42] We should unbox the December anniversary crate.
[3484.60 → 3485.70] And show off what's inside.
[3486.02 → 3487.12] There's Groot socks.
[3487.24 → 3487.74] No way.
[3488.34 → 3488.74] Yeah.
[3489.08 → 3490.16] You have to show the other side.
[3490.96 → 3491.66] I am Groot.
[3492.40 → 3492.98] That's awesome.
[3493.04 → 3495.12] I finally saw that not that long ago, actually.
[3495.72 → 3495.96] Really?
[3495.96 → 3499.78] And our next Fastest Possible actually has the Guardians of the Galaxy joke in it even.
[3500.08 → 3502.24] So these would go perfectly with that.
[3502.78 → 3503.84] Alright, what else we got?
[3504.24 → 3507.00] I don't know what these are actually called, but these are super popular.
[3507.14 → 3507.60] Pop Heroes.
[3508.04 → 3508.18] Yeah.
[3508.18 → 3508.50] Okay.
[3508.68 → 3511.54] I think these were like exclusive or something.
[3512.02 → 3515.32] So this is a Joker Batman hybrid thing.
[3515.36 → 3517.92] Yeah, so this is Batman cosplaying as the Joker.
[3518.06 → 3518.30] Yeah.
[3518.48 → 3518.64] Yeah.
[3518.78 → 3519.70] That's the idea.
[3519.70 → 3525.96] We actually, another thing that we had people showing us on Twitter last week when we were
[3525.96 → 3530.26] going through the loot crate and discovering it had more than we thought was their collections
[3530.26 → 3534.12] of loot crate swag that they accumulated over the course of like a year.
[3534.34 → 3534.72] Yeah.
[3534.94 → 3535.84] That was pretty cool.
[3535.84 → 3538.52] And when you kind of go, and when you do the math, and you go, okay, so that was like
[3538.52 → 3541.76] 150 bucks plus a little bit more.
[3542.34 → 3543.56] That's like not bad.
[3543.58 → 3543.84] Yeah.
[3544.30 → 3544.66] Actually.
[3545.00 → 3545.60] So there you go.
[3545.64 → 3548.02] I'll give you guys a better look at the Batman Joker.
[3548.44 → 3553.36] I can't imagine Batman would actually cosplay as Joker unless it's Joker cosplaying as Batman.
[3553.48 → 3554.64] Yeah, that's what I was kind of thinking.
[3554.90 → 3556.40] The Joker Batman.
[3556.60 → 3557.28] No, it is a Batman.
[3557.56 → 3559.22] It starts, yeah, that's true.
[3559.90 → 3561.18] I was going to say it starts with Joker.
[3561.18 → 3568.18] And the back just like, yeah, that face just about sort of is as confusing as this figurine
[3568.18 → 3568.44] is.
[3568.86 → 3569.54] What else we got?
[3569.56 → 3571.58] So the next thing is Tetris stickers.
[3571.78 → 3573.78] They're officially from Tetris, which I think is interesting.
[3574.08 → 3574.54] Oh, that's cool.
[3574.56 → 3576.40] Like they're actually an officially Tetris branded thing.
[3577.24 → 3577.64] 147.
[3578.20 → 3580.92] 147 Terminus, I think is what they're called.
[3580.96 → 3581.86] Okay, I'm snagging this one.
[3582.26 → 3582.66] Okay.
[3583.58 → 3583.94] Goddamn.
[3584.72 → 3585.64] I wanted that one.
[3585.72 → 3586.54] They show examples.
[3587.28 → 3588.44] They show, oh, my bad.
[3588.44 → 3592.66] They show examples on like bags and laptops and books and phones and everything.
[3592.86 → 3592.98] Oh, that's awesome.
[3592.98 → 3593.66] So you can just do whatever you want.
[3593.66 → 3596.54] Yeah, so you just build your own little Tetris like Punisher dude or like thing that says
[3596.54 → 3600.10] loot crate on the back, which is probably not what I'll put on the back of my laptop.
[3600.32 → 3601.12] Oh, my God.
[3601.14 → 3601.66] No way.
[3601.74 → 3602.24] Oh, I jumped.
[3602.36 → 3603.86] I moved too fast.
[3605.28 → 3606.78] It's a Mighty Wallet.
[3607.08 → 3608.42] And it's the Simpsons.
[3608.50 → 3610.68] It looks like a Simpsons like Where's Waldo thing.
[3611.06 → 3612.08] But it's a Mighty Wallet.
[3612.28 → 3613.04] Oh, that's awesome.
[3613.04 → 3619.04] Like card slots here and in here and this is where your cash goes and there's two different
[3619.04 → 3619.86] sections for that.
[3620.44 → 3621.54] It doesn't seem very durable.
[3622.16 → 3623.28] They're Mighty Wallets though.
[3623.32 → 3624.26] They actually are pretty durable.
[3624.30 → 3624.60] Really?
[3624.80 → 3625.04] Yeah.
[3625.46 → 3626.64] Like they're surprisingly durable.
[3626.88 → 3626.96] That's cool.
[3627.02 → 3628.10] They don't seem like it at first.
[3628.68 → 3628.98] But yeah.
[3629.12 → 3632.18] I've been told, I've never had one, but I've been told that they're quite durable.
[3632.68 → 3633.00] Expenses.
[3633.00 → 3638.58] There's also a like car hanger thing, which is the shield, Captain America's shield from
[3638.58 → 3640.48] the Avengers or from Captain America.
[3640.48 → 3641.94] Oh, it's made of Type.
[3642.28 → 3642.56] Yeah.
[3642.70 → 3643.98] Like it's actually really durable.
[3644.02 → 3644.14] Yeah.
[3644.18 → 3648.88] That's the stuff that that remote control Bluetooth airplane that we, oh, it's like waterproof
[3648.88 → 3649.28] and stuff.
[3649.38 → 3649.48] Yeah.
[3649.54 → 3649.70] Yeah.
[3649.70 → 3649.86] Yeah.
[3649.86 → 3651.88] It doesn't feel, it feels like paper, but it's a.
[3651.98 → 3652.12] Yeah.
[3652.12 → 3655.90] They have a picture of it after one year of use, but it's not exactly high-res.
[3656.08 → 3656.30] No.
[3657.12 → 3657.44] Cool.
[3658.00 → 3658.36] Yeah.
[3658.40 → 3659.38] So this is just like a whoop.
[3659.54 → 3662.12] This is like a car holder thing that you put on your mirror, and it smells like vanilla.
[3663.24 → 3664.00] It's actually kind of cool.
[3664.58 → 3665.52] Captain America car thing.
[3667.00 → 3667.48] Do do do.
[3669.66 → 3670.08] What?
[3671.28 → 3671.76] We talked.
[3671.86 → 3672.32] Oh, okay.
[3672.38 → 3673.10] I think this is just.
[3673.42 → 3673.54] Yeah.
[3673.56 → 3675.82] This is the little commemorative.
[3675.90 → 3678.68] So this month's theme is a very special one as we celebrate anniversaries.
[3678.88 → 3680.62] They've got an interview with Stan Lee.
[3681.60 → 3682.18] There you go.
[3686.68 → 3687.56] What else we got?
[3687.80 → 3688.02] Yeah.
[3688.06 → 3689.34] A bunch of really neat stuff in here.
[3689.92 → 3690.82] Oh, that's interesting.
[3691.44 → 3692.22] Oh, I didn't know that.
[3692.26 → 3694.06] They have deals on other stuff.
[3694.06 → 3698.18] Oh, that kind of makes sense.
[3698.28 → 3698.46] Yeah.
[3699.06 → 3701.08] So like there's a Simpsons house Lego thing.
[3701.16 → 3702.86] Like it's related to the stuff that's in here.
[3702.98 → 3704.06] So there's a Bataan.
[3704.06 → 3704.58] What is that?
[3704.76 → 3705.12] Replica.
[3705.12 → 3705.56] Yeah.
[3705.92 → 3706.90] So that's super cool.
[3706.90 → 3711.04] It's like a $2,000 value thing, and then they sell it for $7.50 or something.
[3711.42 → 3711.92] I guess.
[3712.00 → 3712.86] That's probably why it's cool.
[3712.96 → 3713.54] It's super expensive.
[3713.86 → 3714.14] Yeah.
[3715.18 → 3719.84] Did I tell you about the time that I was tempted to order a full size Han Solo in carbonite like
[3719.84 → 3721.04] official licensed thing?
[3721.04 → 3725.64] It was like 5,000 British pounds and I would have had to spend my entire life savings on
[3725.64 → 3726.18] it at the time.
[3727.10 → 3727.94] I didn't do it.
[3727.94 → 3728.40] That's amazing.
[3729.54 → 3733.22] Come on in you ugly little spud and then warning ghost busting in progress.
[3733.36 → 3734.42] It's a door tag thing.
[3734.92 → 3737.54] They have a like little advertisement for Crunchyroll.
[3737.80 → 3738.12] Oh yeah.
[3738.32 → 3738.60] Okay.
[3739.30 → 3740.50] We rep Crunchyroll too.
[3740.76 → 3741.26] Yeah, we do.
[3741.38 → 3744.82] So unfortunately, sorry Loot Crate, we're not going to do your Crunchyroll link.
[3745.00 → 3746.14] Use our Crunchyroll link.
[3747.98 → 3749.72] Loot Crate December 2014 anniversary.
[3749.72 → 3752.16] I know quite a few people that actually collect all their pins and stuff.
[3752.16 → 3752.84] There's some more stuff in here.
[3752.96 → 3753.36] Yeah.
[3754.48 → 3757.94] Like an actual full comic book from DC Comics, and then I think there's a poster in the
[3757.94 → 3758.22] back.
[3758.50 → 3760.46] I can't really tell, but I think there is.
[3761.08 → 3763.08] They give you a candy cane.
[3763.68 → 3764.30] Oh, it's broke.
[3764.42 → 3765.36] So that totally makes sense.
[3765.48 → 3766.58] Well, it was together.
[3767.10 → 3768.02] Did you break it?
[3768.18 → 3768.34] Yeah.
[3768.52 → 3769.20] Way to go.
[3769.52 → 3769.80] I know.
[3770.82 → 3771.26] Horrible.
[3772.14 → 3773.36] Now, I think.
[3773.76 → 3775.70] Oh no, that's just the card to make it.
[3775.82 → 3777.44] Oh, well that's cool too then.
[3777.44 → 3778.52] Well now I opened it for nothing.
[3778.62 → 3779.00] Way to go.
[3779.72 → 3780.36] Jackass.
[3780.48 → 3782.46] You lost thousands of dollars in value.
[3782.66 → 3786.08] Well, I only paid $13.37 for it.
[3786.24 → 3786.36] Right.
[3786.54 → 3789.82] Like worst case scenario if everything else in the crate was free.
[3790.34 → 3792.70] And then this unfolds to, it looks like a bat cave.
[3792.96 → 3793.64] Yes, I think so.
[3794.04 → 3796.34] Well, does it, do you actually unfold it or do you just?
[3796.38 → 3796.70] Yes.
[3796.78 → 3797.28] Yes, okay.
[3797.28 → 3797.78] Yeah, you do.
[3797.78 → 3797.80] Yeah, you do.
[3797.88 → 3800.68] You unfold it and then there's like a way to set it up.
[3800.74 → 3802.54] So our little joker batman dude stands in there.
[3802.60 → 3802.90] Oh, cool.
[3802.90 → 3804.18] All right.
[3804.18 → 3805.16] So thanks, Loot Crate.
[3805.24 → 3811.42] Guys, it's offer code Linus to save 10%, which because it's so cheap is not actually a lot
[3811.42 → 3817.40] of money, but you might as well safe your $1.37 or $1.33 or whatever that works out too.
[3819.14 → 3819.58] Fantastic.
[3819.58 → 3824.46] It's like I'm not selling the use of the offer code too hard here.
[3825.26 → 3828.66] But it's a good service and considering it's monthly, that'll add up too.
[3829.72 → 3831.02] I think you only save on the first one.
[3831.22 → 3832.44] So yeah, it is what it is.
[3833.56 → 3834.22] All right.
[3834.28 → 3835.28] So what else we got here?
[3835.32 → 3838.32] I think there were a bunch of other topics that we promised to cover.
[3839.00 → 3839.72] Oh, yeah.
[3840.40 → 3843.56] Work rumoured to have begun on a new Nintendo console.
[3843.56 → 3843.88] Right.
[3843.88 → 3848.76] I want to preface this by saying we've had rumours that were exactly this like multiple
[3848.76 → 3850.38] times over the last like two years.
[3850.52 → 3854.86] So this was posted by Master Disaster on the forum and the original article here is from
[3854.86 → 3855.80] Escapist Magazine.
[3857.64 → 3860.80] So Nintendo confirms work is underway on new consoles.
[3861.16 → 3866.40] However, that doesn't really tell us a lot about because work is basically underway on
[3866.40 → 3868.92] new consoles by the time something actually gets released.
[3868.92 → 3873.86] Work has been underway on new consoles since they merged their office buildings like a long
[3873.88 → 3874.42] time ago.
[3874.50 → 3875.02] Do you remember that?
[3875.30 → 3875.40] Yeah.
[3875.48 → 3876.36] They merged their, yeah.
[3876.44 → 3879.62] And they were like, yep, we're going to be working on a new console which brings together
[3879.62 → 3881.22] our mobile and console divisions better.
[3881.54 → 3882.98] They've been saying that since then.
[3883.34 → 3885.24] There's definitely been work underway this whole time.
[3885.54 → 3885.74] Yeah.
[3885.82 → 3888.50] And like the kinds of hints that are being provided are not very useful.
[3888.74 → 3888.86] No.
[3888.96 → 3893.66] From early on, I wanted Mario to be that character in the digital world so that with each digital
[3893.66 → 3896.10] evolution, he was there to usher in the next era.
[3896.10 → 3899.82] I think that maybe when we release the next hardware system, you can look forward to seeing
[3899.82 → 3902.12] Mario take on a new role or in a new game.
[3903.88 → 3904.50] Cool man.
[3905.72 → 3907.52] No information was given ever.
[3907.84 → 3909.88] Like I love Nintendo, but like guys.
[3910.36 → 3913.54] There'll be, Mario will take on a new and unexpected role.
[3913.88 → 3914.94] Oh my gosh.
[3915.10 → 3918.06] Even more unexpected than being in space or driving go-karts.
[3918.12 → 3919.52] Or shooting people with water guns.
[3919.54 → 3920.32] Or playing tennis.
[3920.50 → 3920.80] Or.
[3921.06 → 3922.38] Or drawing things.
[3922.46 → 3923.52] Or whatever the hell he's done.
[3923.52 → 3925.04] With that horrible square mouse.
[3925.04 → 3925.92] That thing was terrible.
[3926.00 → 3926.64] Mario paint.
[3926.88 → 3927.20] Yeah.
[3927.38 → 3929.00] He's been so many different games.
[3929.50 → 3930.86] Fighting off ghosts with Luigi.
[3930.86 → 3932.06] Maybe he helps this time.
[3932.70 → 3935.98] Oh, I guess I forgot to post the link to that in the chat here.
[3936.14 → 3936.34] Right.
[3936.52 → 3939.96] Not that that link contains any useful information whatsoever.
[3940.56 → 3940.96] Nope.
[3941.68 → 3942.72] There we go.
[3943.26 → 3944.10] Book, book, book.
[3944.22 → 3945.54] Okay, so then we.
[3945.54 → 3947.82] Oh, Tesla Roadster version 3.0.
[3947.96 → 3949.30] Now, there was.
[3949.60 → 3951.44] I don't know much about this.
[3951.50 → 3952.82] I know it has a lot more distance.
[3952.82 → 3956.00] So I think they can drive it over 400 miles.
[3956.10 → 3960.80] And they're going to be demonstrating this between San Francisco and Los Angeles in early 2015.
[3961.00 → 3961.72] So that's pretty cool.
[3962.18 → 3962.62] That's a lot.
[3962.68 → 3963.14] What are you doing?
[3963.30 → 3963.74] What is that?
[3963.82 → 3964.24] I'm dancing.
[3964.38 → 3964.62] I don't know.
[3964.64 → 3965.02] I'm excited.
[3965.20 → 3965.36] Cool.
[3965.68 → 3966.62] That's a lot of distance.
[3966.82 → 3967.40] I'm excited.
[3967.58 → 3968.76] Not because of this.
[3969.00 → 3974.06] But because of all this stuff happening will make my Tesla perfect when I can finally afford one.
[3974.52 → 3974.76] Yep.
[3975.52 → 3979.30] So he's probably specifically talking about when they release the like way cheaper ones.
[3979.30 → 3984.30] Because Teslas aren't being resold because they're not really failing.
[3985.10 → 3993.44] So my new plan, because my original plan, as you know, was to buy a Model S when people were like getting rid of them.
[3993.74 → 3994.32] But they're not.
[3994.54 → 3995.44] But they don't.
[3996.16 → 3998.68] And it's like it's kind of like certain brands of cars.
[3998.80 → 4003.12] Like last time I was car shopping, which was admittedly a while ago, there was like no used Suzuki's.
[4003.38 → 4003.90] Like nothing.
[4004.02 → 4007.34] You couldn't find a used Suzuki because I was looking for specifically an SX4.
[4008.12 → 4009.06] And nothing.
[4009.30 → 4010.18] I was like, okay.
[4010.30 → 4011.30] I mean, I know it's really new.
[4011.52 → 4013.40] But, you know, even stuff like the Rabbit.
[4013.50 → 4014.42] We managed to find the Rabbit.
[4014.54 → 4015.78] That was back when we bought my wife's car.
[4015.98 → 4016.08] Yeah.
[4016.24 → 4017.52] Like that was pretty new.
[4017.62 → 4019.02] And you could find a couple used ones.
[4019.06 → 4020.04] And we got a good deal on it.
[4020.16 → 4020.30] Yeah.
[4020.78 → 4028.74] But my plan has actually changed because I realized that I only put about 35 kilometres a day on my car right now.
[4029.22 → 4032.20] So my car has 191,000 kilometres on it.
[4032.20 → 4035.78] Which means that I will be able to drive it for like another five years.
[4035.78 → 4041.70] Well, that might line up well with the timing of the cheaper Tesla.
[4041.92 → 4042.20] Maybe.
[4042.42 → 4045.70] So maybe I will be able to hold out for a cheaper Tesla.
[4045.78 → 4052.54] Otherwise, I'll probably just wait for like a more budget oriented brand to have an electric car that doesn't totally suck.
[4053.08 → 4053.22] Yeah.
[4053.22 → 4054.78] And then I'll go that route.
[4054.78 → 4061.92] Not that they're more budget oriented, but people are starting to partner with Tesla for use of the supercharging stations.
[4062.10 → 4062.24] Right.
[4062.36 → 4065.98] And if they start doing that, then they'll probably be partnering with them in more technology realms.
[4066.16 → 4068.76] Like I think it was BMW is partnering up with them quite closely.
[4068.78 → 4068.88] Yeah.
[4069.22 → 4076.80] And not only is that going to help Tesla by having it so that hopefully BMW is going to contribute and build more supercharging stations.
[4076.92 → 4077.08] Yeah.
[4077.08 → 4083.52] And there will just be more in general, but that'll help consumers because there will be more supercharging stations.
[4083.76 → 4085.46] More infrastructure will be a very good thing.
[4085.56 → 4085.82] Yes.
[4086.92 → 4094.00] But yeah, I mean, then the next five years might be okay because looking at what's happening to gas prices, looking at what's happening in Russia right now.
[4094.10 → 4095.82] I haven't looked at it in a couple of days, but.
[4095.92 → 4096.32] Not better.
[4096.32 → 4099.30] The ruble fell what, like 25% in a day or something.
[4099.30 → 4099.66] Something crazy.
[4099.66 → 4101.18] Ludicrous amount like that.
[4101.18 → 4106.74] Apparently people have been going to different places like Ikea and stuff and just mass buying things while their money is.
[4106.74 → 4112.60] I heard that people are like stockpiling electronics while their money is still worth something.
[4112.78 → 4114.22] Apple pulled out of the country.
[4114.92 → 4123.78] And as I don't, this was rumoured, I think when I was reading about it, but I think the rumour is that other major electronics brands are thinking of pulling out as well.
[4123.78 → 4133.98] Because you've got to consider that these brands have their costs in, let's say, USD, for example, and they're being paid by people in rubles.
[4134.20 → 4135.76] So what are they supposed to do?
[4135.84 → 4138.72] Just jack up their prices 2x from day to day?
[4138.82 → 4139.66] Well, hold on a minute.
[4139.72 → 4140.96] What about what they sold yesterday?
[4141.14 → 4151.18] Now all of a sudden, instead of making, you know, let's say 20% or 30% margin on an item they sold, maybe they just lost 10% on that item they sold by the time they're able to convert the currency.
[4151.18 → 4153.90] What if they can't even find anyone to convert currency for them?
[4154.00 → 4157.14] You guys would be surprised how hard it is to convert foreign currency.
[4157.38 → 4160.10] We have an affiliate code with Amazon UK.
[4160.94 → 4164.54] Getting a Great Britain pound converted here is difficult.
[4165.08 → 4165.94] And a euro too.
[4166.08 → 4168.08] I still have Swedish króna because I can't get it moved.
[4168.08 → 4169.04] Well, those are impossible.
[4169.22 → 4169.88] I can't get it moved.
[4169.92 → 4171.34] I would have thought euro would be easy.
[4171.80 → 4178.18] Last time I was in at my bank cashing an Amazon check, the teller told me that they weren't going to accept euros anymore starting January 1st.
[4178.18 → 4181.48] It's like, what do you mean you're not going to accept euros anymore?
[4181.56 → 4183.94] It's one of the most important currencies in the world.
[4184.14 → 4185.94] That's one of the ways that PayPal is perfect.
[4186.52 → 4186.78] Yeah.
[4186.96 → 4190.26] It'll just move whatever the heck you want at any time.
[4190.52 → 4191.18] It's fantastic.
[4192.38 → 4193.28] Perfect.
[4193.96 → 4195.84] So yeah, Tesla Roadster.
[4195.84 → 4202.82] So predicted 40 to 50% improvement on range between the original Roadster and the Roadster 3.0, which is pretty cool.
[4203.00 → 4208.10] Appointments for upgrading Roadsters will be taken this spring once the new battery pack finishes safety validation.
[4208.32 → 4212.36] They're also having improvements of like drag coefficients for aerodynamics and stuff like that.
[4212.40 → 4214.16] So there's kind of improvements all over the board.
[4214.44 → 4215.12] So that's good.
[4215.12 → 4217.60] Oh, this is exciting.
[4217.80 → 4230.60] So overclockers.co.uk, this was posted originally by Notional on the forum, has exclusively begun selling the first, I'm posting it, the first Free Sync compatible monitor.
[4231.02 → 4237.34] So this is a Yamaha Polite B2888UHSU-B.
[4237.34 → 4240.84] I really wish, like why is it Asus is the only one that figured this out?
[4241.20 → 4242.02] DOG Swift.
[4242.90 → 4250.34] If you have an important model, call it something that we can freaking remember because I don't remember PG287Q.
[4250.68 → 4252.64] Like that's what it's actually, or 278Q.
[4252.88 → 4253.90] Yeah, see, I didn't even get it right.
[4255.06 → 4256.26] I'm not going to remember that.
[4256.34 → 4257.24] It's DOG Swift.
[4257.42 → 4262.26] That's how people, like, why, why do we have to explain this stuff?
[4262.54 → 4262.86] Anyway.
[4263.42 → 4265.30] You do remember some crazy model names though.
[4265.60 → 4266.38] Yeah, some.
[4266.38 → 4268.50] But usually it's when it means something.
[4268.76 → 4272.36] Like most of, like Asus actually does a relatively good job of that.
[4273.08 → 4277.12] And if I buy one or if I use one every day, then I'm much more likely to remember it.
[4277.46 → 4277.94] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4278.36 → 4280.04] But yeah, so this is exciting.
[4280.22 → 4285.00] It's still a 4K TN panel like Acer's G-Sync 4K.
[4285.74 → 4289.68] So it's exciting in that it's got adaptive refresh.
[4290.12 → 4295.62] But it's a little bit less exciting in that it's a TN panel.
[4295.62 → 4297.86] So some people are not going to be that excited.
[4297.94 → 4298.40] And you know what?
[4298.40 → 4311.80] I was really blown away by how much of a difference the Acer IPS monitor that I checked out recently, how much of a difference it made to have that better contrast when I'm trying to use it without scaling.
[4312.02 → 4316.44] Now, it was a 4 inches bigger diagonally, which is a lot bigger than the TN1.
[4316.44 → 4320.10] And the TN1 looks great in games, which is where it's supposed to look great.
[4320.16 → 4320.66] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4320.70 → 4322.60] And the finer image means less antialiasing.
[4322.68 → 4323.58] And all of these things are good.
[4324.70 → 4328.02] But IPS is a really nice thing to have.
[4328.10 → 4329.20] But this one, this one's TN.
[4329.48 → 4333.00] One millisecond response time, 60 hertz refresh rate.
[4333.00 → 4335.54] And the way it's going to work is you buy it now.
[4335.68 → 4338.02] And it's not going to have adaptive sync, even though the driver's ready.
[4338.44 → 4342.04] So the AMD Omega driver is already equipped with adaptive sync.
[4342.34 → 4343.38] Or free sync, excuse me.
[4343.48 → 4346.08] Free sync leverages adaptive sync in the VASIS bag.
[4346.08 → 4349.00] So it has free sync capability.
[4349.20 → 4352.46] But this monitor, you will actually have to send it in for a hardware upgrade.
[4352.78 → 4354.14] Or a firmware upgrade, excuse me.
[4354.30 → 4356.72] In order to unlock the capability.
[4357.78 → 4359.60] So there you go.
[4359.62 → 4360.66] It'll be a free upgrade.
[4362.02 → 4363.44] But yeah.
[4363.60 → 4365.04] Someone in the chat said it's not free.
[4365.14 → 4365.98] But I haven't said anything.
[4366.10 → 4367.34] I haven't seen anything about that.
[4367.70 → 4368.56] Okay, maybe you have to pay shipping.
[4368.82 → 4369.42] That would be a guess.
[4369.90 → 4370.30] I don't know.
[4370.68 → 4374.72] Okay, well either way, it's not super expensive at 390 pounds.
[4374.72 → 4376.64] So that's pretty darn good.
[4376.76 → 4378.68] And then maybe you will have to pay.
[4378.78 → 4382.62] Because I know that AMD was saying that free sync would be about a $100 adder.
[4383.64 → 4387.02] Over regular DisplayPort 1.3 monitors.
[4387.24 → 4387.66] Right, yeah.
[4388.14 → 4392.40] So I mean, I wouldn't necessarily recommend buying into free sync yet.
[4392.52 → 4395.28] Free sync might be God's gift to gamers.
[4395.84 → 4396.28] Seriously.
[4396.98 → 4398.92] Like, I believe in G-Sync.
[4399.12 → 4400.10] I think it's awesome.
[4400.18 → 4402.42] But there's very few people that have seen it kind of in action.
[4402.42 → 4405.08] Yeah, I don't think anyone has seen finished free sync yet.
[4405.34 → 4405.72] Finished?
[4405.90 → 4406.68] No, I don't think so.
[4406.94 → 4409.00] So let's just wait.
[4409.12 → 4415.28] Because if it was as simple as when the GPU is ready to push out a frame, it lets the monitor
[4415.28 → 4420.70] know and refreshes, NVIDIA wouldn't have had to rev their G-Sync technology in between
[4420.70 → 4425.14] demoing it at that press event and actually releasing finalized products.
[4425.14 → 4430.12] They had to completely revise some important stuff about G-Sync in order to make it work
[4430.12 → 4431.02] to their satisfaction.
[4431.54 → 4437.74] So until we've actually seen it, actually working, and AMD claims that actually...
[4437.74 → 4439.04] Oh, I don't know if I should say this.
[4439.10 → 4440.32] I don't know if this is public knowledge.
[4442.34 → 4443.36] Maybe just move on.
[4444.38 → 4445.18] Hold on, hold on.
[4445.20 → 4445.78] I'm going to find out.
[4445.82 → 4446.96] I'm going to find out if I can say it.
[4447.10 → 4447.30] Okay.
[4447.30 → 4454.76] I asked Linus for sale if he'd watched the show live today, and he said he sure will,
[4454.92 → 4456.30] and then he hasn't responded to me yet.
[4458.42 → 4459.30] AMD freezing.
[4459.30 → 4459.90] I want to know.
[4460.58 → 4464.18] And another keyword that I don't want to tell you guys about because it might give away too
[4464.18 → 4464.48] much.
[4467.58 → 4468.48] This is awkward.
[4469.04 → 4470.10] Why don't we do a Twitter blitz?
[4470.20 → 4471.98] We had a couple plans for Twitter blitzes.
[4471.98 → 4472.70] Yes, we did.
[4472.70 → 4475.70] We can have the first one...
[4475.70 → 4477.60] Crap.
[4477.94 → 4478.48] Where are they?
[4479.44 → 4480.96] Best Christmas present.
[4482.34 → 4482.78] Top.
[4482.90 → 4483.42] They're all over.
[4483.48 → 4484.74] Yeah, tell us what you've got.
[4484.80 → 4485.46] Oh, oh, oh.
[4485.78 → 4487.92] Boxing Day slash Black Friday shopping.
[4488.04 → 4488.52] Do you do it?
[4488.58 → 4489.02] Yeah.
[4489.36 → 4495.26] So I went out today because I had to get some number 32 rubber bands, of all things, for
[4495.26 → 4497.44] a super fun video that's going to be coming out this weekend.
[4497.44 → 4508.80] And I kind of marvelled as I was on my way out the door that I had forgotten that today
[4508.80 → 4512.84] in Canada is Boxing Day, which is the equivalent of Black Friday down in the States.
[4513.30 → 4517.00] And Luke was like, yo, dog, I wouldn't go to Walmart.
[4517.20 → 4518.40] I heard it's like crazy there.
[4518.66 → 4519.68] And I was like, why would it be?
[4520.08 → 4520.56] Oh.
[4520.56 → 4527.38] Oh, it has been so long since I have gone Black Friday or Boxing Day shopping in person
[4527.38 → 4528.82] that I had kind of forgotten.
[4529.20 → 4533.96] The last time I did it, the last time I did it for real, was when I kind of realized that
[4533.96 → 4535.24] I didn't care about it.
[4535.52 → 4538.74] And the reason was that one of the deals I got was great.
[4538.98 → 4542.86] I bought a 19-inch 1280 by 1024 LCD.
[4542.86 → 4546.78] It was the last one out of the 15 available at NCI in Burnaby.
[4547.50 → 4553.12] And I got it for like some smoking crazy deal, like $100 less than what you would typically
[4553.12 → 4554.18] pay for something like that.
[4554.22 → 4555.30] And I really needed one anyway.
[4555.54 → 4558.82] But I waited out in the cold for it for like an hour and a half, two hours.
[4560.88 → 4566.74] But the other things that I bought that day, one of them made me realize that this wasn't
[4566.74 → 4573.34] for me, I bought a CD writer that was advertised for $5 after mail-in rebate.
[4573.54 → 4573.74] Yeah.
[4574.12 → 4577.48] And that was actually the one mail-in rebate that I ever didn't get.
[4577.72 → 4582.10] I'm mostly an advocate for mail-in rebates because they've always worked for me.
[4582.44 → 4587.98] And if my purchase can be subsidized by someone else being lazy, yeah.
[4588.06 → 4588.86] And that works for you.
[4588.88 → 4591.84] And that's great because a lot of people just don't get it.
[4592.00 → 4594.92] They're like, oh, well, I don't want a $20 mail-in rebate.
[4595.00 → 4596.34] I want $20 off at the till.
[4596.34 → 4597.86] Well, it doesn't work that way.
[4598.30 → 4601.52] You can't give $20 off at the till because that's $20.
[4602.30 → 4606.22] A mail-in rebate, a $20 mail-in rebate is probably more like $6.
[4607.02 → 4608.52] Because not that many people will do it.
[4608.64 → 4609.90] Because not that many people will do it.
[4610.06 → 4611.14] That's how this works.
[4611.40 → 4613.44] That's why some people get $20 off.
[4613.78 → 4616.22] Because if it wasn't $20, it would have been $6.
[4616.86 → 4618.32] So get that through your head.
[4618.94 → 4619.88] It doesn't work that way.
[4620.02 → 4620.22] Anyway.
[4620.42 → 4620.94] Like at all.
[4621.06 → 4623.92] So it was a $25 item with like a $20 rebate.
[4623.92 → 4626.40] So it was a $5 CD writer back at a time when that mattered.
[4626.54 → 4627.64] Like that's how long ago this was.
[4627.88 → 4628.06] Yeah.
[4628.22 → 4628.32] Yeah.
[4628.32 → 4630.16] And I never got the rebate.
[4630.60 → 4637.54] And then I actually never ended up using that CD writer until several years later.
[4638.12 → 4639.40] And it turned out to be DOA.
[4639.68 → 4640.52] I had never tested it.
[4640.52 → 4641.28] Oh, no.
[4641.28 → 4642.88] And I kind of went, you know what?
[4643.24 → 4651.90] For the money that I saved on that Boxing Day versus the money that I wasted on stuff I didn't end up actually needing, maybe this isn't for me.
[4651.96 → 4654.98] Maybe some people have more discipline, and it works better for them.
[4655.26 → 4656.94] But it's not for me.
[4657.40 → 4660.74] So we want to hear your guys' Boxing Day stories.
[4661.12 → 4662.10] Bad Sigma lens.
[4662.10 → 4666.40] We're more meaning, uh, Blade of Goss is the new moderator on the forum.
[4666.68 → 4670.00] But we're more meaning, uh, like in store.
[4672.30 → 4673.54] Oh, Cassidy.
[4674.58 → 4680.14] Yeah, I had, I had, I had some, I was going to say someone, but I guess we know exactly who it is now.
[4680.50 → 4686.40] Um, Cassidy walked up to me at the Walmart and, uh, I think said the same thing to me twice.
[4686.70 → 4690.46] Like something like, um, oh, you know, I hope you had a great Christmas.
[4690.96 → 4692.34] And then we talked for a little bit.
[4692.46 → 4695.18] And then I was walking away, and he's like, oh, I hope you had a great Christmas.
[4695.34 → 4696.30] Wait, I already said that.
[4696.68 → 4697.50] Sorry, this is awkward.
[4697.80 → 4698.52] Don't worry, dude.
[4698.90 → 4703.00] I had, someone saw me at Guilford Mall when I was like frantically buying Christmas presents.
[4703.22 → 4705.72] And I had to race out to my car because I had to go meet someone.
[4706.52 → 4708.12] So I'm like fast walking past him.
[4708.18 → 4709.78] He's like, hey, it's like, and I'm like, hi.
[4709.96 → 4710.70] And just keep walking.
[4711.34 → 4713.82] Later on, I was like, that was probably rude.
[4714.48 → 4714.80] But really?
[4714.80 → 4717.32] I tweeted out, and I was like, I didn't mean to do that.
[4717.44 → 4722.58] I think honestly, the, the, the most difficult ones for me are when the person treats it like
[4722.58 → 4727.62] it's no big deal because I have a terrible memory, and I've met a lot of people over the
[4727.62 → 4729.18] years, and I'm terrible with faces.
[4729.56 → 4735.54] So, um, I was on my way into my favourite Vietnamese restaurant and someone in a group of people
[4735.54 → 4736.98] was just like, hey Linus.
[4737.48 → 4742.22] And I was like, and I'm just like, I'm carrying two children in my arms.
[4742.22 → 4745.70] Like I just like, Hey, you never know if it's like that dude from high school that you don't
[4745.70 → 4746.74] remember or yeah.
[4746.96 → 4747.10] Yeah.
[4747.28 → 4748.80] Or if you were, I just had no idea.
[4748.88 → 4750.04] And they were like totally casual.
[4750.16 → 4750.84] They were just like, Hey Linus.
[4750.88 → 4752.72] And then they like looked the other way and kept on walking.
[4753.72 → 4759.40] I would, I would rather you just said hi instead of walking past me and tweet me later, which
[4759.40 → 4760.02] happens a lot.
[4760.02 → 4766.12] And something that bugs me just cause like, I never know how I did in that situation is
[4766.12 → 4771.04] when we go through a full interaction, and then they're like, okay, bye slick.
[4771.18 → 4772.76] And I'm like, ah, you knew me.
[4772.84 → 4773.06] What?
[4773.82 → 4775.26] Like, that's not fair.
[4776.26 → 4776.90] You know what?
[4776.90 → 4777.84] I wasn't paying attention.
[4777.84 → 4784.24] I think the funniest tweet that I've ever seen about viewer fan interaction was actually
[4784.24 → 4785.10] from PewDiePie.
[4785.46 → 4790.28] I follow him just because I'm sort of idly curious about how you become the number one internet
[4790.28 → 4791.72] sensation in the entire world.
[4792.64 → 4794.90] And the tweet was, it was, it was like really hilarious.
[4795.36 → 4796.04] He's like, yeah.
[4796.14 → 4801.68] So I was shopping and someone's coming up to, walking up to me from kind of far off.
[4801.68 → 4803.36] And I kind of like get my hair ready.
[4803.44 → 4804.40] I'm sure it's a fan.
[4804.40 → 4807.02] And the guy walks up, and he's like, Hey, you took my shopping cart.
[4810.20 → 4811.16] That's fantastic.
[4811.72 → 4816.02] It's like, cause yeah, I'd imagine by the time you've got like umpteen bazillion followers,
[4816.02 → 4818.28] like you probably get approached in public a lot.
[4818.34 → 4823.98] Like it happens to me once in a while, but he would be an order of magnitude or two more
[4823.98 → 4824.54] than me.
[4824.72 → 4824.96] Yeah.
[4825.06 → 4827.36] So yeah, it probably happens a lot.
[4827.48 → 4827.68] Yep.
[4827.90 → 4828.10] Yep.
[4828.76 → 4832.54] Um, apparently I've had stuff in my hair the whole land show.
[4832.54 → 4832.70] Yeah.
[4832.74 → 4833.40] It's peanut butter.
[4834.40 → 4835.24] Oh, you do?
[4835.46 → 4835.60] Yeah.
[4835.70 → 4837.62] I have some, I think it's on this side or something.
[4837.62 → 4837.94] Yeah.
[4838.04 → 4838.22] Yeah.
[4838.28 → 4840.82] I had a bunch that I didn't notice right in here.
[4840.94 → 4841.70] Maybe it's on this side.
[4841.74 → 4842.48] I don't know if they can see.
[4842.48 → 4842.60] Yeah.
[4842.60 → 4843.14] There's jelly.
[4843.52 → 4843.82] Yeah.
[4844.12 → 4844.28] Yeah.
[4844.34 → 4844.82] Still good.
[4845.38 → 4845.60] Yeah.
[4846.60 → 4847.26] Oh crap.
[4847.32 → 4849.04] Apparently someone saw me in Dollarama too.
[4851.20 → 4854.00] I was shopping everywhere today trying to find those rubber bands.
[4854.00 → 4859.80] Um, all right.
[4859.96 → 4861.70] Are we, are we getting any tweets here?
[4862.12 → 4862.98] No ton.
[4863.22 → 4864.90] I noticed that after, actually.
[4865.90 → 4866.24] All right.
[4866.24 → 4867.34] Let's see if people, okay.
[4867.34 → 4867.86] There we go.
[4868.00 → 4868.20] There we go.
[4869.08 → 4869.88] Very nice.
[4870.00 → 4870.34] Wow.
[4870.34 → 4871.60] That's terrible though.
[4871.68 → 4872.92] Because, oh my goodness.
[4873.18 → 4874.94] We never, we never talked about this.
[4875.50 → 4878.10] The, uh, the gift from the, uh, from the forum.
[4878.20 → 4879.36] Oh, yes.
[4880.00 → 4882.22] Because that was supposed to show up for last one show.
[4882.28 → 4882.98] So it's been a week.
[4882.98 → 4883.62] Yeah.
[4883.88 → 4889.56] So this was a Christmas present from the, uh, from, from some of our, some of our favourite
[4889.56 → 4894.44] members on the forum who apparently hate us because they want us to die.
[4894.84 → 4898.86] So they sent us all this freaking candy.
[4899.02 → 4899.64] And you know what?
[4899.80 → 4904.52] I have had so much of it that I have noticeably put on padding on my stomach.
[4905.36 → 4905.90] Noticeably.
[4906.04 → 4909.06] Like to my hands can feel the padding I put on.
[4909.06 → 4913.36] I had probably about an entire ginormous thing of Jelly Bellies.
[4913.74 → 4913.88] Yeah.
[4914.02 → 4917.30] And I took two of these M&Ms home and Yvonne only gave away one of them.
[4917.50 → 4919.26] So you can bet that I'm going to eat a bunch of those.
[4919.40 → 4921.26] I managed to get away from the Skittles.
[4921.36 → 4921.88] It's got free.
[4922.04 → 4926.26] But I think Taryn has probably eaten like three bags of M&Ms and an entire bag of Skittles.
[4926.32 → 4927.80] He's trying to put on weight though.
[4927.88 → 4928.04] So.
[4928.18 → 4928.36] Yeah.
[4928.40 → 4930.54] So you guys just about killed us.
[4930.54 → 4933.34] Thank you for the heartwarming Christmas present though.
[4933.82 → 4936.88] Um, but maybe next time something a little healthier, please.
[4939.06 → 4940.96] Um, okay.
[4941.08 → 4942.58] So back to, back to Twitter blitz.
[4942.74 → 4942.92] Yeah.
[4942.98 → 4946.34] I don't know how you can buy chocolate after the holiday.
[4946.48 → 4948.54] I have eaten so much stuff.
[4948.76 → 4950.26] I even have more dinners to go to.
[4950.42 → 4951.36] I'm not even done yet.
[4951.64 → 4953.42] Oh, apparently there have been some password leaks.
[4953.54 → 4953.66] Okay.
[4953.66 → 4954.54] I'll have to check that out.
[4955.88 → 4958.06] Got the Black Pebble Steel on Friday for 150 bucks.
[4958.12 → 4959.00] That's a great deal.
[4959.28 → 4960.70] That is a fantastic deal.
[4960.70 → 4963.42] I paid $299 for mine and I don't regret it for a second.
[4963.56 → 4963.64] Yeah.
[4963.72 → 4964.40] That's super legit.
[4964.40 → 4966.46] Um, nice.
[4966.56 → 4967.52] GX60 laptop.
[4968.26 → 4969.26] 65-inch TV.
[4969.40 → 4969.66] Yeah.
[4970.02 → 4970.42] TVs.
[4970.62 → 4971.36] Black Friday and Boxing Day.
[4971.36 → 4972.48] You know what really bugs me though?
[4972.56 → 4974.52] Is I don't want a smart TV.
[4975.68 → 4978.22] Just buy a smart TV and use it dumbly.
[4978.52 → 4980.38] I know, but then their features are annoying.
[4980.70 → 4983.06] Like that's the argument that people have for Windows 8.
[4983.36 → 4985.20] It's just like, oh yeah, just don't use those things.
[4985.32 → 4988.48] I'm like, yeah, but they're there, and they'll pop up every once in a while and drive me crazy.
[4988.64 → 4988.94] Right.
[4989.24 → 4990.50] Like it all, ugh, yeah.
[4990.64 → 4991.52] I don't want a smart TV.
[4991.64 → 4992.64] Bought a new 850 Pro.
[4992.80 → 4993.34] Nice choice.
[4993.90 → 4994.58] Solid SSD.
[4994.98 → 4996.26] Chromecast is going to be way better anyway.
[4997.30 → 4998.44] Oh, Sancho.
[4999.64 → 5001.46] Love more in-depth on the whole room water cooling.
[5001.74 → 5004.30] Yes, we are definitely going to give you guys more details.
[5004.42 → 5010.30] The final video will be a complete rundown of everything, like looking at the finished project.
[5012.04 → 5016.16] So, um, all right, let's see if we've got anything else here.
[5016.16 → 5020.18] There are no things like that in Poland, says Adam K.
[5020.20 → 5023.00] That's a bummer because it can be a really great time to get some shopping.
[5023.42 → 5025.24] Yes, Tony, mission accomplished.
[5026.34 → 5029.78] Um, paint for a DIY green screen wall.
[5029.88 → 5032.44] Wow, these are a lot of things that I wouldn't have really thought about shopping for.
[5032.46 → 5033.84] I definitely didn't expect the paint thing.
[5033.90 → 5034.38] That's awesome.
[5034.68 → 5036.48] Isaac apparently got a Keep On Digging shirt.
[5036.66 → 5037.04] Nice.
[5037.76 → 5038.58] Yeah, man.
[5038.68 → 5038.96] Yay.
[5040.30 → 5042.04] Um, this is interesting.
[5042.04 → 5046.02] Do I consider myself a Mac guy now, since you saw the other side of the fence?
[5046.12 → 5055.56] Well, next week I'll actually be releasing part three, which is kind of the critical part of the switched experience.
[5055.66 → 5057.96] But I've been using the iMac for over a month now.
[5058.94 → 5059.48] And, um...
[5059.48 → 5060.18] Put this into perspective.
[5060.72 → 5062.94] You said you were going to use Google Glass for how long?
[5063.68 → 5064.34] One month?
[5064.66 → 5065.00] Yeah.
[5065.88 → 5066.48] And...
[5066.48 → 5068.46] I took it off within a day because it's garbage.
[5069.48 → 5069.74] Yeah.
[5069.96 → 5071.44] So I've managed to stick with it.
[5071.52 → 5073.22] I'm still using it as my daily driver.
[5073.84 → 5077.30] Um, and I'll go into this in much more detail when I do my full video.
[5077.44 → 5079.40] But I do use Parallels for some things.
[5079.46 → 5079.90] I do cheat.
[5079.98 → 5081.78] I use Windows applications for a few things.
[5081.80 → 5083.46] But I think that's, like, how it should be used.
[5083.48 → 5084.82] I think that's how people use Mac.
[5084.94 → 5085.18] Yeah.
[5085.44 → 5085.86] It's funny.
[5085.96 → 5089.02] I think my mom is actually a bigger Mac hater than me.
[5089.60 → 5091.50] Her whole school is Apple.
[5091.50 → 5094.78] And I was, uh, I was, I was there for Christmas.
[5094.92 → 5096.42] And I was like, whose iPad is this?
[5096.72 → 5097.60] She's like, mine.
[5098.16 → 5100.32] I'm like, when did you get an iPad?
[5100.52 → 5101.48] She's like, it's for work.
[5101.92 → 5104.68] And she's just like, it's like, it's like...
[5104.68 → 5106.62] And she just goes off on, like, a tirade, right?
[5106.90 → 5109.92] She's just like, it's like they don't get it.
[5110.10 → 5113.32] Every time something doesn't work because it's a Mac,
[5113.62 → 5117.30] they're, like, perplexed that it wouldn't work because it's a Mac.
[5117.30 → 5119.82] And she's just like, I can do this on my PC.
[5119.82 → 5124.10] And every time they're surprised, freshly.
[5124.58 → 5126.58] It doesn't work because it's a Mac.
[5127.06 → 5128.20] I'm just like, whoa, Mom.
[5128.78 → 5129.06] Whoa.
[5129.90 → 5134.78] So, um, so yeah, we've actually got a really cool build log coming
[5134.78 → 5136.76] that was a collaborative thing with WD.
[5136.86 → 5139.76] We wanted this to happen during the holiday season,
[5139.76 → 5142.04] but it looks like it's going to be hopefully next week
[5142.04 → 5146.20] where we actually built a PC for a local school.
[5146.30 → 5147.72] Speaking of my mom, who works at a school,
[5147.72 → 5151.80] we built a PC for the Resource Centre slash.
[5152.10 → 5156.12] It also gets used for some video creation and stuff like that.
[5156.58 → 5160.04] So we're building a PC with WD's help for a local school,
[5160.22 → 5162.06] and we're going to be actually donating that.
[5162.12 → 5164.54] Speaking of PCs for schools instead of Macs.
[5164.62 → 5166.00] So that's going to be pretty cool.
[5166.08 → 5166.96] The whole theme of it,
[5167.22 → 5169.50] maybe should we just give away the peanut butter jelly thing?
[5170.18 → 5170.90] Ah, let's give it away.
[5170.90 → 5174.96] Okay, so the theme of it is what goes well together,
[5175.14 → 5176.60] and WD's whole thing is like,
[5176.70 → 5178.88] yes, an SSD is great for your OS drive,
[5179.20 → 5182.44] but what could be better than SSD plus hard drive?
[5182.64 → 5184.98] And it's kind of like a peanut butter and jelly type thing
[5184.98 → 5186.70] because I think we can all agree
[5186.70 → 5190.66] that one alone is not the best tool for the job.
[5190.74 → 5192.64] You should be running an SSD for your OS
[5192.64 → 5194.34] and your key applications and a hard drive
[5194.34 → 5195.72] for your overflow and storage.
[5195.72 → 5196.96] We should figure out how that resulted
[5196.96 → 5199.66] in us having peanut butter and jelly in our hair
[5199.66 → 5201.46] once that video comes out.
[5201.64 → 5202.74] So don't miss that one.
[5202.88 → 5203.82] Don't miss that build log.
[5204.92 → 5205.52] Ridiculous.
[5205.82 → 5207.24] You know, I'd love to hear from you guys
[5207.24 → 5210.58] how you are enjoying the build log format in general.
[5210.70 → 5212.78] It's a little bit different from our build guides,
[5213.28 → 5215.10] and I'll straw pool this up here.
[5217.40 → 5221.10] How have you been enjoying...
[5221.10 → 5222.64] Do we have anything else to cover today?
[5222.64 → 5226.00] Not majorly, I don't think.
[5226.18 → 5228.22] Again, a lot of stuff wasn't really going that crazy
[5228.22 → 5229.48] because it was Christmas.
[5231.14 → 5233.60] Good few companies weren't even really doing anything this week.
[5233.92 → 5234.32] Yes.
[5234.48 → 5236.00] So, I don't know.
[5237.02 → 5238.08] I had a lot of people ask
[5238.08 → 5240.50] if we were going to do a WAN show today
[5240.50 → 5242.30] because it's a stat.
[5242.52 → 5243.22] It's not a stat.
[5243.32 → 5243.88] It's not a stat.
[5244.14 → 5245.48] And even if it was, I'd be here.
[5245.50 → 5246.06] I think it might be a stat in Ontario,
[5246.36 → 5248.72] and I think it's a stat for federal employees everywhere.
[5249.34 → 5250.80] But it's not a stat for everyone.
[5251.22 → 5251.48] Yeah.
[5251.48 → 5252.54] It's funny.
[5252.68 → 5256.20] One of our newer employees was surprised
[5256.20 → 5258.84] to find out that there were only two days off
[5258.84 → 5260.08] in the holiday season.
[5261.78 → 5262.78] It's like, really?
[5263.20 → 5264.72] Welcome to content schedules.
[5265.30 → 5265.48] Yeah.
[5265.78 → 5269.28] Welcome to, like, you know,
[5269.48 → 5271.24] not a cushy corporate job.
[5272.42 → 5273.22] Sorry, man.
[5273.64 → 5274.70] You know what's funny, though,
[5274.70 → 5279.32] is our recent transition from the corporate job
[5279.32 → 5280.58] that, like, paid better.
[5281.06 → 5282.74] I was talking to him about this the other day.
[5282.82 → 5284.60] He says this is, like, way better.
[5284.82 → 5285.00] Yeah.
[5285.14 → 5286.54] Like, way better.
[5286.76 → 5289.58] Like, he would take the pay cut every day
[5289.58 → 5290.88] to work for a smaller company
[5290.88 → 5293.42] where he has creative freedom and, like...
[5293.42 → 5296.14] More say and ability to just do things.
[5296.14 → 5296.20] Yeah.
[5296.20 → 5298.14] Can be excited about his job every day.
[5298.14 → 5299.86] He's just like, yeah, the amount of money
[5299.86 → 5303.02] that people spend to make themselves happy
[5303.02 → 5304.70] when they work in a job that they hate
[5304.70 → 5305.44] that pays better,
[5306.10 → 5308.34] he feels like for him just cancels out
[5308.34 → 5310.16] because he doesn't need to spend a bunch of money
[5310.16 → 5311.42] to make himself happy anymore.
[5311.68 → 5312.94] And he's just like, yeah,
[5313.36 → 5314.74] eight plus hours a day,
[5314.78 → 5315.74] I'm going to be at work.
[5315.74 → 5318.28] So if you also sleep six to seven hours a day,
[5318.30 → 5322.24] that means literally half of your time in your life.
[5322.24 → 5325.12] And then there's time that goes into getting to work
[5325.12 → 5326.26] and getting ready for work
[5326.26 → 5328.66] and leaving work and winding down from work.
[5328.70 → 5331.10] So it's like the majority of your day is working.
[5331.44 → 5331.64] Yeah.
[5332.04 → 5333.36] So it's like, I was like, yeah,
[5333.42 → 5335.14] that is a fascinating perspective.
[5335.22 → 5336.62] I mean, it's part of the reason that I did this.
[5336.66 → 5338.02] I didn't want to work with tools.
[5338.38 → 5341.84] So I was like, I'll just make my own team with no tools.
[5343.78 → 5345.62] Except for the hardware bin.
[5345.98 → 5348.92] So people are mostly enjoying the whole build log format.
[5349.28 → 5349.72] So that's cool.
[5349.76 → 5350.28] I like it.
[5350.36 → 5351.96] I actually really, I like filming it.
[5352.06 → 5352.98] I like watching it.
[5353.94 → 5356.50] I've watched every build log after we've done them.
[5356.96 → 5358.02] Like the mineral oil build logs,
[5358.10 → 5359.24] I watched every single one of those.
[5359.38 → 5359.52] Yeah.
[5360.78 → 5363.06] I like it personally, so I'm happy they like it.
[5363.44 → 5365.10] I find it fun to build it that way.
[5365.56 → 5365.74] Yeah.
[5365.74 → 5367.36] Because we just get to kind of do whatever
[5367.36 → 5369.30] and that's probably why it's fun to watch too.
[5369.30 → 5370.78] It's a lot more fun to teamwork,
[5371.34 → 5373.58] like building a computer than it is to build one by yourself.
[5373.76 → 5374.22] It really is.
[5374.22 → 5375.44] And I think that's like,
[5375.92 → 5377.16] I think that's how it is in real life too.
[5377.28 → 5377.74] Yeah, that's true.
[5377.82 → 5380.44] Even if you're not logging it or whatever else.
[5380.64 → 5382.24] Most of the computers that I've built,
[5382.30 → 5383.84] like if I would build a computer for a friend,
[5384.02 → 5385.08] say I was back in high school,
[5385.36 → 5387.38] that's where I built most of my computers for friends
[5387.38 → 5388.42] or in university or whatever.
[5388.64 → 5388.80] Yeah.
[5388.80 → 5391.74] I would just get them to come over
[5391.74 → 5392.96] and I'd build it with them
[5392.96 → 5394.56] and just try to like to teach them how to do it
[5394.56 → 5395.14] while we were going.
[5395.24 → 5395.64] And I'd be like,
[5395.70 → 5396.58] all right, so you have to do this.
[5396.64 → 5398.00] And I'd get them to do it
[5398.00 → 5399.30] and try to guide them through it and stuff.
[5399.36 → 5400.78] And it was honestly pretty cool.
[5400.92 → 5404.02] And then a fairly basic computer
[5404.02 → 5405.74] is fairly basic to build.
[5406.10 → 5407.32] So by the end of it,
[5407.40 → 5409.32] they were able to feel fairly confident
[5409.32 → 5410.24] about building computers.
[5410.24 → 5411.70] And then a lot of them from that
[5411.70 → 5412.82] are now interested in computers
[5412.82 → 5413.78] and building their own stuff.
[5413.78 → 5414.98] And it's cool.
[5415.12 → 5416.48] I like building computers with people.
[5416.94 → 5418.92] So I think we'll close out the show
[5418.92 → 5423.58] with just sort of one more recap thing.
[5423.64 → 5424.60] I wanted to thank you guys
[5424.60 → 5426.36] for making this such an incredible year.
[5426.86 → 5429.82] And not just an incredible year overall,
[5430.04 → 5431.74] but even just lately,
[5432.02 → 5435.94] your support's been even more than ever before.
[5435.94 → 5439.38] I mean, this year we hit a bunch of amazing milestones.
[5439.72 → 5442.02] We broke the 1 million subscriber threshold.
[5442.02 → 5444.24] So my understanding is that our gold plaque
[5444.24 → 5445.50] is actually in the mail.
[5445.88 → 5446.30] Oh, cool.
[5446.40 → 5448.40] Or should be at some point in the near future here.
[5449.08 → 5452.32] We also reached new all-time highs
[5452.32 → 5453.96] for views in a single day.
[5454.50 → 5456.26] We just crushed the old record
[5456.26 → 5457.98] when we were releasing mineral oil.
[5458.10 → 5459.56] And I think we released a mineral oil
[5459.56 → 5461.84] and a whole room water cooling video back to back.
[5462.22 → 5464.10] So we just completely destroyed
[5464.10 → 5465.10] That's going to be hard to beat.
[5465.10 → 5467.92] The previous record we set at CES 2013
[5467.92 → 5470.08] when we released like 20 videos in one day.
[5470.46 → 5470.54] Yeah.
[5470.54 → 5472.88] So that was while releasing only one video a day.
[5473.96 → 5475.66] We also, in December,
[5475.86 → 5478.64] are going to destroy our previous all-time high
[5478.64 → 5479.78] for monthly views.
[5479.98 → 5482.52] So our previous best was actually last month
[5482.52 → 5484.74] at 11.89 million.
[5485.28 → 5486.72] And then this month,
[5486.76 → 5489.16] we are tracking something like 13.5 million
[5489.16 → 5490.46] in one month,
[5490.52 → 5492.96] making us one of the largest tech channels
[5492.96 → 5494.18] on the entire YouTube.
[5494.58 → 5495.54] So, you know, that's...
[5495.54 → 5497.62] We want to thank you guys so much
[5497.62 → 5498.98] for your support there as well.
[5499.86 → 5501.82] Another big one is Tech Quickie.
[5502.20 → 5503.38] Like, I don't know how many of you
[5503.38 → 5504.48] are subscribed to Tech Quickie,
[5504.54 → 5506.46] but I'm really proud of what we're doing over here.
[5507.10 → 5508.90] I think it's great content.
[5509.08 → 5510.06] I think you guys agree.
[5510.24 → 5513.46] It's tracking close to 1,000 new subscribers a day,
[5513.82 → 5515.50] around 100,000 views a day.
[5515.50 → 5517.06] I mean, our secondary channel
[5517.06 → 5519.84] is as big as a lot of other YouTubers'
[5520.14 → 5521.54] primary channels at this point.
[5521.78 → 5523.52] And it's only because of you guys
[5523.52 → 5525.34] that we can do stuff like that.
[5526.14 → 5527.86] And then Tech Quickie as well
[5527.86 → 5530.60] is going to absolutely crush its previous best,
[5530.70 → 5531.64] which was set last month,
[5531.72 → 5533.28] 2.35 million views.
[5533.72 → 5535.80] And we are tracking over 3 million
[5535.80 → 5537.56] for the last 30 days.
[5537.56 → 5537.58] Nice.
[5537.58 → 5540.94] So you guys are just making this work for us.
[5541.36 → 5544.42] I feel like we're also working really hard at it,
[5544.86 → 5547.66] but this kind of stuff doesn't happen
[5547.66 → 5548.98] without you guys tuning in
[5548.98 → 5550.02] and watching all the videos.
[5550.20 → 5551.94] I mean, WAN Show has gone
[5551.94 → 5555.56] from 50,000 views per archive
[5555.56 → 5557.46] to over 100,000 this year.
[5557.60 → 5557.82] Yep.
[5558.34 → 5561.26] Linus Tech Tips videos in general have gone...
[5561.26 → 5563.60] I mean, it's not just the overall viewership
[5563.60 → 5565.08] of the archived content.
[5565.08 → 5567.66] I mean, it wasn't that long ago,
[5567.78 → 5568.30] just here,
[5568.76 → 5570.72] sort of having a look at my dashboard here,
[5570.80 → 5571.96] it wasn't that long ago
[5571.96 → 5574.50] that something with 200,000 views
[5574.50 → 5575.88] was an exception
[5575.88 → 5577.72] and something with, you know,
[5577.80 → 5579.44] 100,000 views was great.
[5579.56 → 5580.74] That was earlier this year.
[5581.16 → 5582.08] Nowadays, I mean,
[5582.10 → 5583.52] you look at everything we release,
[5583.64 → 5587.78] 150,000, 170,000, 255,000, 221,000.
[5587.90 → 5589.66] This is all stuff from like a week ago.
[5589.94 → 5590.10] Yeah.
[5590.54 → 5591.78] You guys are just, yeah,
[5591.82 → 5593.06] you're blowing us away with your support
[5593.06 → 5594.14] and we really appreciate it.
[5594.14 → 5596.90] And here's to a fantastic 2015.
[5597.22 → 5599.22] And also, I guess I can confirm
[5599.22 → 5600.58] when we're taking possession
[5600.58 → 5601.98] of the new office space.
[5602.20 → 5604.08] So that'll be at the end of February.
[5604.76 → 5605.90] There'll be a lot of work
[5605.90 → 5606.98] that needs to be done to it.
[5607.06 → 5607.22] Yep.
[5607.34 → 5607.70] But yeah.
[5608.00 → 5609.94] Don't expect us to do a tour immediately,
[5610.62 → 5612.84] but we're already in contact
[5612.84 → 5613.84] with someone who's helping us
[5613.84 → 5615.12] design the office space.
[5615.20 → 5616.42] We do have to do some renovations.
[5616.42 → 5618.32] So it'll take a while for us
[5618.32 → 5619.10] to actually move in.
[5619.20 → 5620.68] But yeah, we're really excited.
[5620.82 → 5622.12] I think we're moving in a great direction
[5622.12 → 5623.86] and you guys are really helping us get there.
[5624.06 → 5626.42] So with all that touchy-feely stuff
[5626.42 → 5626.96] out of the way,
[5627.56 → 5628.20] thanks for watching.
[5628.30 → 5629.48] We'll see you guys again next week
[5629.48 → 5629.98] in the new year.
[5630.98 → 5631.26] Bye.
[5632.86 → 5633.26] Outro.
[5635.34 → 5635.96] Oh, Geez.
[5636.38 → 5636.84] I got this.
[5636.94 → 5637.28] I got this.
[5637.28 → 5637.30] I got this.
[5638.58 → 5639.84] Some things never change.
[5646.42 → 5658.86] All right.
[5659.06 → 5659.50] Sponsors.
[5659.98 → 5661.14] CES, Phantom Glass,
[5661.28 → 5662.02] Linda.com,
