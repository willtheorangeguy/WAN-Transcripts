[0.00 --> 5.30]  Alright, I just need to make sure that we're actually live.
[6.44 --> 7.44]  And we are.
[7.58 --> 10.58]  Okay, so we have a great show for you guys this week.
[10.68 --> 16.38]  As you can see, Small Linus is not here, but Large Linus is here.
[16.86 --> 19.26]  So with Large Linus here, we thought we'd just go ahead with the show.
[19.32 --> 22.70]  I know the framing is a little weird and stuff, but we thought we'd try it out and see what you guys think.
[22.98 --> 27.94]  So as you guys know, this is Jerry Berg or Barnacles, and we have him on the show this week.
[28.12 --> 29.32]  Where can people find you?
[29.32 --> 30.84]  How can people see your stuff?
[31.26 --> 34.92]  The easiest way to see my stuff would be just to go to barnnerd.com.
[34.98 --> 39.12]  You know the barn, like where they keep the cows, and the nerds, like where they keep the nerds.com.
[39.30 --> 39.88]  That's where I'm at.
[40.34 --> 41.78]  Perfect, so you guys can see him there.
[42.12 --> 44.90]  And for the show this week, we have a few different topics.
[44.98 --> 47.40]  I'm actually going to let you start them off this time.
[48.56 --> 48.88]  Really?
[50.14 --> 50.90]  For real?
[51.12 --> 52.40]  Oh my gosh.
[52.86 --> 53.32]  Oh my gosh.
[54.46 --> 57.12]  Do I really have to start with Fractal Josh is awesome, though?
[57.32 --> 57.82]  Do I really?
[57.82 --> 58.22]  Yes, you do.
[58.22 --> 59.90]  We've got to go through the callouts again.
[60.22 --> 60.86]  Oh, the callouts.
[60.98 --> 61.26]  Do the callouts.
[61.26 --> 62.42]  Then we're going to do Fractal Josh.
[62.48 --> 64.34]  All right, so do I get to start the callouts this time?
[64.50 --> 64.74]  Yep.
[65.40 --> 65.76]  Yay!
[65.90 --> 66.64]  All right, guys.
[66.92 --> 70.42]  We've got a mass exodus of Xbox exclusives.
[70.84 --> 72.18]  Yeah, I care about that a whole lot.
[72.42 --> 74.80]  Okay, GameStop, fingerprints, customers.
[75.12 --> 76.52]  Actually, that sucks.
[77.12 --> 77.98]  All right, now I'm kind of depressed.
[77.98 --> 79.54]  Take it away.
[79.54 --> 79.66]  Take it away.
[79.66 --> 84.12]  And then PhysX is being disabled when there's a second GPU in the system, which is not NVIDIA.
[85.36 --> 85.60]  Yeah.
[85.94 --> 86.06]  We'll see that later.
[86.40 --> 92.60]  And the most important news of the week at all, definitely, is that Yoshi's full name has been revealed.
[92.88 --> 95.24]  So we will talk about that later as well.
[95.70 --> 96.48]  Let's do the intro.
[96.48 --> 122.34]  All right, so our first sponsor this week is lynda.com.
[122.34 --> 126.04]  You can sign up with lynda.com slash WAN show for a free seven-day trial.
[126.26 --> 132.04]  They have thousands and tons of freaking courses, and they're adding new ones every single week.
[132.42 --> 137.14]  The plan starts at about $25 a month, but again, if you sign up with our link, you get seven days free.
[137.56 --> 140.42]  And our second sponsor is 5-4 Club.
[140.50 --> 141.80]  I'm wearing their shirt today.
[142.26 --> 145.30]  And if you sign up, you get a...
[145.30 --> 151.20]  We're doing a giveaway, actually, where if you like this picture, which I'll drop in the chat here in one second,
[152.34 --> 153.98]  that second is going to be delayed.
[154.16 --> 155.96]  I'll drop the chat in there in like 30 seconds.
[156.16 --> 161.02]  If you follow at 5-4 on Twitter, and if you comment with hashtag LinusStyleTips,
[161.40 --> 167.18]  we will announce a winner on Monday on 5-4's page for who wins a free month of 5-4, I believe.
[167.92 --> 171.46]  It is about $120 worth of clothing each month for $60.
[172.00 --> 176.58]  And if you sign up right now, you get $15 off your first month with offer code LINUS.
[176.58 --> 181.60]  Again, I'll be dropping that Instagram picture link in the chat in a second.
[181.60 --> 188.60]  Now, our first topic, which you already spoiled slightly, is that Fractal Josh is freaking amazing.
[189.26 --> 194.48]  So, I want to show this, but my HDMI setup is not really working great.
[194.80 --> 197.56]  Spoiler alert, nothing really got that much better when Linus left.
[199.22 --> 200.54]  Let's see here.
[200.92 --> 202.04]  Let's see if this actually works.
[202.24 --> 207.16]  Because Fractal Josh made probably the greatest shirt that exists in the entire universe.
[207.16 --> 211.32]  And he's going to be sending me one, which I'm pretty stoked about.
[211.92 --> 215.96]  But he's going to be sending it to my personal address so that when Linus sees it, he doesn't burn it.
[216.24 --> 219.00]  Because that's a legitimate worry for this.
[219.26 --> 220.88]  So, let's see if this actually totally breaks.
[221.36 --> 222.90]  Oh, it did too!
[223.42 --> 225.26]  I don't even know if this is plugged in.
[226.52 --> 228.06]  Oh, that sucks.
[228.28 --> 229.30]  I'll bring it up over here.
[229.30 --> 230.16]  Give me one second.
[233.42 --> 234.86]  Oh, my God.
[234.88 --> 235.56]  I can't wait.
[235.90 --> 236.90]  I can't wait.
[237.00 --> 237.58]  Come on!
[237.64 --> 238.56]  It's going to take a second.
[238.92 --> 240.38]  Oh, come on!
[242.02 --> 242.66]  No, guys.
[242.72 --> 243.46]  I can see it.
[243.50 --> 244.42]  You guys can't see.
[244.58 --> 245.70]  So, I'm just saying.
[245.94 --> 248.12]  Privy to certain knowledge here, apparently.
[248.24 --> 249.52]  So, that is the shirt.
[249.74 --> 251.52]  As you can see, it's kind of small.
[251.52 --> 257.84]  But as you can see, there's fractal Josh in the middle, fist bumping me and throwing a pie at Linus' face.
[258.30 --> 258.80]  That's epic.
[258.98 --> 259.88]  It's just great.
[260.16 --> 261.16]  I love this shirt.
[261.46 --> 263.12]  And like I said, he's going to be sending me one.
[263.20 --> 265.98]  So, it will be featured on a WAN show sometime in the future.
[266.36 --> 269.84]  Thank you, Josh, for making such a beautiful artistic creation.
[270.82 --> 272.62]  And we hope to see more in the future.
[273.10 --> 274.30]  And it even looks authentic.
[274.50 --> 275.32]  That's what's so beautiful.
[275.56 --> 275.94]  It does.
[276.26 --> 277.66]  It actually took me a second.
[277.78 --> 279.70]  He sent me the tweet saying, like, oh, do you like the shirt?
[279.70 --> 281.86]  And I was like, yeah, man, you got one of our shirts.
[281.96 --> 282.28]  That's cool.
[282.36 --> 283.92]  And I was like, wait, there's a third guy in the middle.
[284.48 --> 285.32]  What's going on here?
[285.34 --> 287.34]  That's the problem with going with those 8-bit graphics.
[287.58 --> 288.54]  They're easy to replicate.
[289.10 --> 289.90]  They are.
[290.16 --> 290.68]  Give me a second.
[290.74 --> 291.32]  I'm trying to figure out.
[291.36 --> 292.50]  It was just working.
[293.12 --> 294.36]  Come on, HDMI cable.
[295.26 --> 297.26]  Usually, when Linus is gone, everything works.
[297.34 --> 299.40]  So, I have a feeling that he sabotaged something.
[299.86 --> 301.34]  Have you ever seen one of my streams?
[301.82 --> 303.12]  This is par for the course.
[303.12 --> 305.34]  Like, me just being here probably just screwed up everything.
[306.60 --> 308.46]  Okay, so that's not working at all.
[308.46 --> 309.30]  So, I'm going to have to...
[309.30 --> 310.46]  I can't do some reconfiguring.
[310.58 --> 311.34]  We'll figure this out.
[311.64 --> 315.72]  So, first thing we have is the USB bug thing.
[315.86 --> 317.80]  Now, this is interesting.
[317.98 --> 321.78]  And I'm happy that they actually properly, like, researched it and stuff.
[322.16 --> 324.16]  But it's not really anything new.
[324.24 --> 326.34]  We've known this for a really long time.
[326.44 --> 331.86]  So, what I'm talking about is two Berlin researchers named Karsten Knoll and Jacob Lell.
[331.86 --> 333.76]  I hope I didn't totally butcher that.
[333.76 --> 341.04]  But they have demonstrated how any USB device could be used to infect a computer by faking the device type it is.
[341.12 --> 342.40]  So, telling it it's something else.
[342.52 --> 345.22]  Or having little partitions on there that you can't properly format.
[345.72 --> 348.04]  And just infecting computers all over the place.
[348.20 --> 350.06]  Again, it's a fairly interesting study.
[350.50 --> 353.20]  But, like, I've known this since I was in, like, grade 10.
[353.48 --> 354.70]  Maybe even before that.
[355.64 --> 357.50]  Yeah, don't plug unknown stuff into your computer.
[357.68 --> 358.02]  I mean, come on.
[358.02 --> 359.56]  It's a very well-known thing.
[359.68 --> 362.52]  Like, anyone who's been around for a while probably knows what hacks are.
[362.64 --> 363.12]  Switchblade.
[363.58 --> 366.70]  The USB hacks that people can get that just totally wreck you.
[368.72 --> 369.52]  Look at that.
[369.68 --> 371.00]  You 3D printed that, right?
[371.40 --> 371.64]  Yeah.
[371.90 --> 374.68]  And this one right here is a hack.
[374.86 --> 375.18]  And this one...
[375.18 --> 375.60]  No, I'm just kidding.
[375.70 --> 376.80]  I don't do that, guys.
[377.00 --> 377.42]  I'm legit.
[377.54 --> 377.84]  Come on.
[378.10 --> 379.30]  I don't know if I believe you.
[379.46 --> 380.40]  I don't want hacks or people.
[380.56 --> 385.48]  I have a little red painted USB drive that is like a don't plug this into your computer USB drive.
[385.96 --> 387.30]  You know what I like is all the people that have been...
[387.30 --> 390.68]  Have you seen the people take the Matchbox cars and haul them out and put the USB dongle in there?
[390.74 --> 391.26]  So it's just...
[391.26 --> 394.20]  It's like a full-blown Matchbox car with just the USB port sticking out the back.
[394.20 --> 394.36]  That's pretty cool.
[394.60 --> 395.32]  It's pretty cool.
[395.36 --> 396.42]  I'm going to try doing that at some point.
[396.44 --> 397.18]  That's actually pretty cool.
[397.36 --> 399.66]  So don't plug malicious crap into your computer, guys.
[399.72 --> 399.96]  Just don't.
[399.96 --> 400.60]  Yeah, seriously.
[401.50 --> 406.10]  What you can do to help this is get the USB umbrella kind of thing.
[406.16 --> 409.54]  I'm hoping to get a sample from these guys to actually try it out myself.
[410.02 --> 415.94]  But essentially what they've done is made a USB pass-through plug that just cuts off all the data lanes on the USB.
[415.94 --> 419.94]  So it still lets power flow, but it just doesn't have the runs for data.
[420.04 --> 421.70]  So it can't actually transfer any data.
[422.14 --> 425.40]  They're usually, unless they're trying to give you data off a USB device,
[425.64 --> 427.64]  as long as they're trying to plug their phone or something into your computer,
[427.88 --> 429.88]  they should only be getting power anyways.
[430.48 --> 430.88]  Yeah.
[431.16 --> 433.34]  That's an interesting invention, actually.
[433.90 --> 434.62]  Yeah, it is.
[434.66 --> 435.50]  And it makes sense.
[436.02 --> 438.28]  I'm actually kind of surprised that no one thought about it beforehand
[438.28 --> 440.62]  because we've done this type of stuff in other applications.
[440.62 --> 440.98]  Yeah.
[441.46 --> 445.74]  And you can see it when people get the slightly cheaper DVI cables as well.
[445.88 --> 446.98]  Certain runs aren't there.
[447.38 --> 448.48]  It's like, this is a thing.
[448.60 --> 449.96]  So someone actually decided to do it with USB.
[450.36 --> 450.88]  So it's kind of cool.
[450.94 --> 454.28]  You can use it yourself if you want to plug something of yours into someone else's.
[455.02 --> 456.72]  Say you want to charge your phone on someone else's computer
[456.72 --> 459.26]  and you don't want to grab an infection from their computer to your phone,
[459.72 --> 461.40]  you can use it in that way.
[461.44 --> 462.66]  Or you can use it defensively.
[462.74 --> 465.68]  So if someone wants to plug something into your phone or your computer,
[465.68 --> 469.36]  even if you trust them, they might have a virus from someone else on their phone.
[469.36 --> 469.74]  That's true.
[470.18 --> 471.68]  So just maybe, I don't know.
[471.78 --> 473.98]  I'm going to try and pick up some of these USB umbrella things
[473.98 --> 475.34]  and try them out in the future.
[475.52 --> 477.54]  I love that kind of stuff.
[477.86 --> 479.18]  You know what's going to piss you off, though,
[479.24 --> 480.68]  like when you keep forgetting to unplug it
[480.68 --> 481.76]  and then you plug something in the back of it
[481.76 --> 483.54]  and you're like, why is it fine on my device?
[483.70 --> 483.94]  Why?
[483.94 --> 484.52]  It's working.
[485.04 --> 485.68]  It's ridiculous.
[486.22 --> 487.24]  It's fairly large.
[487.36 --> 489.04]  Like, it's not the smallest thing ever.
[489.12 --> 490.40]  I think they could have made it smaller.
[490.62 --> 491.28]  I'm not sure, though.
[491.30 --> 493.06]  It is, like, version one or whatever.
[493.28 --> 495.48]  So I think you'd probably know.
[495.48 --> 498.00]  And, like, knowing me, I'd probably just get, like, six
[498.00 --> 499.92]  and put them all over the place
[499.92 --> 500.94]  and, like, keep one in my backpack
[500.94 --> 502.26]  and, like, keep one in my butt
[502.26 --> 503.74]  with whatever laptop I have at the time
[503.74 --> 504.42]  and all that kind of stuff.
[505.18 --> 505.88]  I don't know.
[505.98 --> 506.32]  That's cool.
[506.62 --> 508.80]  So that's a fairly interesting thing.
[508.96 --> 512.72]  But then we jump to something kind of horrible, in my opinion,
[512.80 --> 514.72]  which is the GameStop fingerprinting thing.
[515.30 --> 516.36]  Did you have time to read this?
[517.04 --> 518.18]  I didn't read through it,
[518.20 --> 520.82]  but I think the title pretty much explains that this is ridiculous.
[521.32 --> 523.60]  I mean, I'm guessing when you purchase things,
[523.60 --> 525.54]  they're basically storing your fingerprint like a bank would
[525.54 --> 526.44]  if you're cashing a check?
[526.66 --> 528.70]  Luckily, it's not just purchasing things.
[528.82 --> 531.36]  What they're actually doing is when you're selling things
[531.36 --> 533.62]  because their idea, they did this voluntarily.
[533.98 --> 535.20]  They were not forced to do this.
[535.46 --> 539.10]  Apparently, the law enforcement agency asked them to,
[539.56 --> 541.72]  but the Philadelphia, where it is being done,
[541.78 --> 543.92]  is in Philadelphia City, not the suburbs around it,
[543.94 --> 544.68]  but just in the city.
[544.68 --> 548.74]  The Philadelphia City Solicitor Shelby Smith says specifically,
[549.22 --> 551.70]  what GameStop does doesn't meet any of the elements
[551.70 --> 555.00]  of the definition in the code for pawn shops.
[555.48 --> 558.66]  So the pawnbreaker ordinance doesn't apply to GameStop.
[559.40 --> 561.56]  She said essentially GameStop is not required
[561.56 --> 564.84]  to collect the thumbprints to abide by the city's pawnbroker law.
[565.14 --> 567.66]  So they do have a law where if you're a pawn shop,
[567.80 --> 569.32]  you're supposed to take people's fingerprints
[569.32 --> 570.70]  when they sell stuff to you.
[570.94 --> 574.14]  The idea behind this is so that if you sell them stolen goods.
[574.14 --> 574.74]  You're right.
[574.88 --> 575.82]  They can find you.
[576.18 --> 578.28]  That kind of maybe makes sense.
[578.36 --> 579.60]  Personally, I'm still not a huge fan
[579.60 --> 581.04]  because of invasion of privacy and whatnot.
[581.66 --> 583.42]  Maybe find some other way to find them,
[583.54 --> 586.24]  like take their ID down or something like that.
[586.44 --> 588.32]  Like ID them to make sure it's the same person
[588.32 --> 589.46]  and then take their ID down.
[589.58 --> 591.16]  I don't think you need to fingerprint everyone
[591.16 --> 592.36]  that freaking sells you something.
[592.68 --> 595.18]  No, besides whose fingerprints are in the system?
[595.28 --> 597.22]  I mean, yeah, okay, if you're already a past criminal,
[597.22 --> 599.32]  but if it's your first offense, yeah, good luck finding them.
[599.52 --> 600.50]  That's part of the idea.
[600.50 --> 604.36]  The Philadelphia Police Department says that GameStop
[604.36 --> 606.42]  is being proactive by obtaining the fingerprints
[606.42 --> 609.80]  and uploading them to a database known as Leeds Online,
[610.04 --> 613.24]  which they are then compared against criminal databases.
[613.80 --> 614.34]  That makes sense.
[614.58 --> 616.68]  Yeah, you're not being put into a criminal database.
[617.16 --> 619.48]  Some ideas later on down the road when you commit a crime,
[619.58 --> 620.54]  then all of a sudden they come in and they go,
[620.62 --> 621.84]  yeah, you were jaywalking,
[621.84 --> 624.26]  but you also sold like 40 games to GameStop
[624.26 --> 625.00]  that you didn't own.
[625.14 --> 627.22]  So I'm sorry, your sentence is now life.
[627.22 --> 628.72]  Yeah, I don't know.
[628.96 --> 629.54]  That's interesting.
[630.76 --> 631.82]  I'm not a huge fan,
[631.90 --> 633.44]  but it's just everything lately
[633.44 --> 635.46]  just seems like horrible, horrible news.
[635.64 --> 638.24]  And all the tin hatters that everyone used to laugh at
[638.24 --> 640.62]  are now like in public view.
[640.94 --> 643.50]  So everything that comes out like this just scares me.
[643.86 --> 645.36]  Well, I remember Banks used to do that,
[645.42 --> 646.00]  like where you'd go in,
[646.02 --> 646.96]  if you had a large check,
[647.04 --> 648.10]  you had to do the fingerprint.
[648.18 --> 649.38]  I hated that stuff.
[649.70 --> 650.58]  You had to rub it off
[650.58 --> 652.90]  and it would like turn to like little custom stuff
[652.90 --> 654.08]  and get all over your clothing and everything.
[654.18 --> 655.34]  I was like, no, I don't want to do this.
[655.34 --> 655.82]  Yeah.
[657.08 --> 659.26]  GameStop has quoted that at this time,
[659.34 --> 660.72]  they're reviewing the process to determine
[660.72 --> 663.66]  if it is one which should be continued in Philadelphia
[663.66 --> 665.48]  and they're not doing it anywhere
[665.48 --> 668.50]  outside of just like the downtown Philadelphia core.
[668.80 --> 671.52]  So hopefully they just stop.
[671.78 --> 673.20]  What if you're like under 18 though
[673.20 --> 674.08]  or something like that?
[674.12 --> 675.96]  Can they legally even fingerprint you at that point?
[676.20 --> 678.04]  I don't know because that's like American,
[678.26 --> 679.88]  that's American law, not Canadian law.
[680.08 --> 681.76]  But there's, is that a thing?
[681.76 --> 683.36]  Cause I know here they do like,
[683.56 --> 685.84]  we're going on a field trip to the police station
[685.84 --> 687.96]  and then they fingerprint you when you're kids.
[688.86 --> 690.20]  Actually, they do that down here too.
[690.38 --> 691.94]  Yeah, it's so bullcrap.
[692.10 --> 693.52]  I just know we have weird laws down here.
[693.58 --> 694.58]  Like I know you're not allowed to like,
[694.64 --> 695.22]  you're not allowed to,
[695.28 --> 696.86]  the city can't photograph children.
[696.98 --> 697.74]  Like in Washington state,
[697.76 --> 699.22]  they put up all these like radar traps
[699.22 --> 700.36]  to take pictures of your car.
[700.68 --> 702.24]  And like people are fighting back
[702.24 --> 702.70]  under the pretense
[702.70 --> 703.80]  that you're taking pictures of our children
[703.80 --> 705.32]  like sitting in the passenger seat or something.
[705.36 --> 705.92]  They actually won.
[706.74 --> 707.38]  So they're like,
[707.44 --> 709.30]  apparently you can't take pictures of people's kids.
[709.30 --> 710.44]  Like it's weird.
[710.70 --> 711.58]  We have weird laws, man.
[711.62 --> 712.28]  I'm moving to Canada.
[713.68 --> 714.44]  That's nuts.
[714.54 --> 715.36]  Give me one second.
[715.46 --> 717.82]  People are saying that I'm quiet for some reason.
[719.30 --> 720.30]  I'm not sure why,
[721.30 --> 725.10]  especially when everyone in the test stream
[725.10 --> 726.30]  said it was totally fine.
[727.08 --> 728.20]  But we will see.
[728.38 --> 729.28]  Give me one quick sec.
[730.08 --> 731.62]  Is it multiple people complaining?
[732.14 --> 733.96]  Well, it's Twitch chat spamming.
[734.08 --> 735.36]  So it could be one person.
[735.48 --> 736.52]  It could be 30 people.
[736.80 --> 737.66]  It could be a whole bunch of people
[737.66 --> 738.84]  just spamming for fun.
[739.30 --> 740.72]  I'm not even really sure.
[741.16 --> 742.38]  But that might fix it.
[742.78 --> 744.30]  So we will have to see.
[744.76 --> 745.60]  We'll wait for Twitch chat
[745.60 --> 746.60]  to be able to catch up.
[748.44 --> 749.74]  Yeah, I unmuted the stream.
[749.82 --> 750.64]  You are a little quiet,
[750.74 --> 751.52]  but it's not horrible.
[752.46 --> 754.24]  Well, the mic's a lot closer now.
[754.56 --> 755.70]  And in my own monitoring,
[755.88 --> 757.82]  I can tell that I'm a fair amount louder now.
[757.90 --> 758.92]  So we'll have to see.
[759.02 --> 760.48]  Hopefully that works just fine.
[761.10 --> 761.50]  Sweet.
[763.48 --> 763.88]  Okay.
[764.24 --> 766.02]  So next up is Twitch.tv Changes,
[766.12 --> 766.98]  which has had everyone
[766.98 --> 768.12]  kind of freaking out lately.
[768.12 --> 769.16]  I've seen that.
[769.16 --> 770.02]  But they've been reeling back
[770.02 --> 771.20]  like this whole time.
[771.30 --> 771.74]  They're obviously
[771.74 --> 773.12]  an extremely agile company.
[774.74 --> 776.68]  So they've implemented a few things.
[776.82 --> 777.70]  Their automatic system
[777.70 --> 780.14]  muting video on demand videos
[780.14 --> 781.94]  for having copyright audio
[781.94 --> 784.32]  is doing that.
[784.32 --> 787.08]  But now there's an appeal button.
[787.36 --> 788.54]  So you can press the appeal button
[788.54 --> 790.20]  to try to get your video unmuted,
[790.48 --> 791.32]  which is interesting.
[791.44 --> 792.64]  That appeal button wasn't there
[792.64 --> 793.80]  right off the start.
[794.76 --> 796.92]  The maximum time limit on highlights
[796.92 --> 798.18]  has now been removed,
[798.40 --> 801.42]  but you can't have just everything
[801.42 --> 803.14]  that you've recorded forever
[803.14 --> 804.14]  always saved,
[804.30 --> 805.08]  which is interesting
[805.08 --> 806.06]  because if someone just goes like
[806.06 --> 807.40]  highlight entire video,
[807.60 --> 809.46]  I wonder if that's possible.
[810.06 --> 810.20]  Yeah.
[810.20 --> 811.66]  What about people that have so much stuff
[811.66 --> 812.78]  already recorded and uploaded?
[812.78 --> 813.66]  That's going to affect them
[813.66 --> 814.38]  pretty adversely.
[815.00 --> 815.38]  Probably.
[815.74 --> 817.62]  And because I do know for a fact
[817.62 --> 818.40]  that people go back
[818.40 --> 819.58]  and watch different episodes.
[819.74 --> 821.90]  I know that my 24-hour charity stream
[821.90 --> 824.18]  actually got a lot of VOD views.
[824.62 --> 824.84]  Yep.
[825.20 --> 826.26]  So I don't know.
[826.28 --> 826.84]  That's going to be interesting.
[826.94 --> 828.24]  I'm going to try to highlight out
[828.24 --> 829.38]  most of the cool parts
[829.38 --> 830.42]  of the 24-hour stream.
[832.72 --> 833.16]  Yeah.
[833.50 --> 833.96]  I don't know.
[833.96 --> 835.52]  This is what happens
[835.52 --> 837.20]  when Google buys YouTube
[837.20 --> 838.96]  and then buys Twitch
[838.96 --> 840.72]  is we're going to see
[840.72 --> 842.14]  lots of really awesome changes.
[842.28 --> 842.94]  I bet you every day
[842.94 --> 844.10]  we log into Twitch now,
[844.16 --> 845.04]  there's going to be new buttons
[845.04 --> 846.02]  we've never seen before
[846.02 --> 847.40]  and the layout's going to change
[847.40 --> 848.16]  like every day.
[848.16 --> 848.58]  They're like plus one.
[848.82 --> 848.98]  Yeah.
[849.18 --> 850.64]  You know the Google plus the type?
[850.84 --> 851.88]  Oh my God, dude.
[852.06 --> 852.84]  You see, it's coming.
[852.96 --> 853.52]  Mark my words.
[853.58 --> 853.96]  It's coming.
[854.22 --> 854.90]  Oh my God.
[854.96 --> 855.42]  Ridiculous.
[855.58 --> 857.56]  So the Twitch CEO,
[857.70 --> 858.30]  Emmett Shear,
[858.40 --> 859.92]  had a Reddit AMA
[859.92 --> 860.48]  where he said
[860.48 --> 861.38]  a whole bunch of stuff,
[861.52 --> 862.10]  but essentially
[862.10 --> 863.10]  one of the big things
[863.10 --> 863.76]  in my opinion,
[864.12 --> 864.58]  is that he said
[864.58 --> 866.36]  we did need to change things.
[866.48 --> 867.54]  This is laying groundwork
[867.54 --> 868.88]  for some work in the future
[868.88 --> 870.32]  you guys are really going to like.
[870.74 --> 871.66]  We've been intending
[871.66 --> 872.78]  to do this for some time,
[872.88 --> 873.76]  but it took us a while
[873.76 --> 874.80]  to identify and select
[874.80 --> 876.44]  a content identification partner
[876.44 --> 877.92]  to get this system up
[877.92 --> 878.84]  and reliable.
[879.34 --> 880.62]  So the whole thing of like
[880.62 --> 881.56]  things you guys
[881.56 --> 882.48]  are really going to like,
[882.88 --> 883.80]  I have a weird theory
[883.80 --> 884.56]  that I don't,
[884.58 --> 885.68]  I haven't yet seen
[885.68 --> 886.44]  anyone else say it,
[886.50 --> 887.62]  but I wouldn't be surprised
[887.62 --> 888.28]  if someone else has said it.
[888.28 --> 889.10]  Let's hear this theory.
[889.40 --> 890.62]  I'm wondering if they're
[890.62 --> 892.10]  going to have their own music streaming,
[892.10 --> 894.52]  like approved music streaming thing.
[895.46 --> 896.52]  Like these are the amount of songs
[896.52 --> 897.56]  that you're allowed to play
[897.56 --> 898.94]  and what songs they are
[898.94 --> 899.92]  and you can play them
[899.92 --> 900.98]  using our tool.
[901.46 --> 901.58]  Well,
[901.64 --> 902.44]  they kind of did the same thing
[902.44 --> 902.84]  for YouTube,
[902.98 --> 903.36]  didn't they?
[903.48 --> 904.90]  Like YouTube had an audio library
[904.90 --> 905.86]  pop-up that was like
[905.86 --> 907.08]  openly available to everybody.
[907.40 --> 908.10]  I think so,
[908.20 --> 909.82]  but then Twitch is,
[910.30 --> 911.66]  YouTube is used for music,
[911.66 --> 913.18]  but directly from
[913.18 --> 914.70]  a lot of the music's publishers,
[914.88 --> 915.98]  whether it's like Vivo
[915.98 --> 917.62]  or the artists themselves
[917.62 --> 919.44]  or the like record label
[919.44 --> 919.88]  or whatever.
[920.66 --> 921.66]  YouTube is done
[921.66 --> 923.64]  widely for that,
[923.74 --> 924.68]  but Twitch is done
[924.68 --> 925.82]  in the background
[925.82 --> 927.12]  while someone is playing something.
[927.42 --> 927.80]  That's true.
[927.82 --> 928.36]  So I wonder if they're going to try
[928.36 --> 929.86]  and contact different record labels
[929.86 --> 930.30]  and stuff
[930.30 --> 931.68]  and see if they can get
[931.68 --> 932.94]  approved music.
[933.78 --> 934.82]  They might do that.
[934.86 --> 935.62]  They might even do like
[935.62 --> 937.60]  some kind of ad-based thing too,
[937.66 --> 938.58]  where if they detect music
[938.58 --> 938.94]  on your thing,
[938.98 --> 940.24]  they'll just run ads for that.
[940.70 --> 940.98]  You know,
[941.06 --> 941.62]  that could be beneficial.
[941.62 --> 942.30]  I'd rather that
[942.30 --> 943.72]  because I make no freaking ad revenue
[943.72 --> 944.78]  off my Twitch channel anyways.
[945.22 --> 946.82]  So just let me play music
[946.82 --> 948.16]  and take all the revenue.
[948.32 --> 948.78]  That's fine.
[948.84 --> 949.22]  I don't care.
[949.48 --> 949.60]  Yeah,
[949.60 --> 950.38]  because if somebody's listening
[950.38 --> 950.84]  to the song,
[950.90 --> 951.78]  they're going to be the most likely
[951.78 --> 952.92]  to give you an impression.
[953.06 --> 953.20]  I mean,
[953.22 --> 953.54]  they're going to be like,
[953.56 --> 953.80]  oh man,
[953.82 --> 954.40]  that's a cool song.
[954.44 --> 955.22]  I'm going to click that link.
[955.26 --> 956.20]  It'd be beneficial to them.
[956.22 --> 956.74]  They should do that.
[957.18 --> 958.42]  It makes way more sense.
[959.48 --> 960.10]  But then again,
[960.10 --> 960.86]  we're smart people.
[960.86 --> 961.94]  I don't know about them
[961.94 --> 962.82]  Google guys sometimes,
[962.94 --> 964.18]  but they're all just throwing
[964.18 --> 964.70]  their money around
[964.70 --> 965.80]  trying to make Google Plus win.
[966.00 --> 966.98]  I don't get it.
[967.20 --> 968.46]  The whole Google Plus win thing,
[968.54 --> 969.30]  I don't really understand,
[969.46 --> 970.20]  but I don't think I'm going to
[970.20 --> 971.14]  throw Google under the bus
[971.14 --> 971.96]  because I think like
[971.96 --> 974.14]  half the wit of someone's dog
[974.14 --> 974.92]  that works at Google
[974.92 --> 976.06]  is probably higher than me.
[976.62 --> 977.78]  I'm actually just playing around.
[977.88 --> 979.42]  If I went back to the IT field,
[979.52 --> 980.56]  Google would be the first company
[980.56 --> 981.92]  I went and actually worked for.
[982.26 --> 983.26]  That would be beast, man.
[983.50 --> 984.72]  They're pretty stand up.
[984.78 --> 985.58]  I've actually talked to a lot
[985.58 --> 986.16]  of people at Google.
[986.30 --> 986.94]  They're pretty cool.
[987.30 --> 987.52]  Yeah.
[988.58 --> 989.64]  Best of YouTube,
[989.90 --> 990.46]  stop it!
[990.80 --> 990.94]  Okay.
[991.34 --> 991.62]  Sorry,
[991.68 --> 992.52]  I had to get that rant out of the way.
[992.52 --> 993.20]  I kind of agree,
[993.32 --> 993.96]  so it's no big deal.
[994.40 --> 995.84]  Another thing that he talked about
[995.84 --> 998.04]  is how there's a lot of agreements
[998.04 --> 999.06]  for different game companies
[999.06 --> 1000.42]  so they won't try to get you in trouble
[1000.42 --> 1001.90]  if you're playing games on Twitch,
[1002.04 --> 1002.76]  but those agreements
[1002.76 --> 1004.42]  don't exist for music.
[1005.04 --> 1005.78]  So people that are like,
[1005.84 --> 1007.16]  oh, it's our right to do this.
[1008.78 --> 1009.84]  I also heard a rumor,
[1009.98 --> 1010.60]  I don't know if you know,
[1010.76 --> 1012.12]  is this true that you can still
[1012.12 --> 1013.38]  play the music on your stream?
[1013.46 --> 1014.78]  It'll just be muted in the recording
[1014.78 --> 1015.94]  or is it muted immediately?
[1016.10 --> 1017.56]  I think that's how it works,
[1017.82 --> 1019.06]  but I think that's not supposed
[1019.06 --> 1019.82]  to be the idea.
[1020.50 --> 1021.86]  I think you're supposed to stop.
[1021.86 --> 1022.60]  I just don't think
[1022.60 --> 1023.86]  they're muting live streams.
[1024.56 --> 1025.44]  I think you might be able
[1025.44 --> 1026.28]  to get in trouble now.
[1027.18 --> 1027.90]  I'm not really sure.
[1028.06 --> 1029.24]  And if it's not like that already,
[1029.24 --> 1030.20]  I'm sure they're going to move
[1030.20 --> 1030.80]  in that direction.
[1031.26 --> 1032.30]  I saw some funny streams
[1032.30 --> 1032.74]  the other day
[1032.74 --> 1033.74]  when I was looking around on there
[1033.74 --> 1034.86]  with titles like
[1034.86 --> 1036.24]  playing copyright music
[1036.24 --> 1037.40]  all day, all night.
[1038.30 --> 1039.76]  That's how I found out about this
[1039.76 --> 1041.14]  was originally all these people
[1041.14 --> 1042.50]  just kind of spiting them.
[1042.74 --> 1043.34]  So I was like, hmm.
[1043.34 --> 1043.56]  Right.
[1044.42 --> 1046.60]  It's not Twitch's fault though.
[1046.76 --> 1047.18]  It's not.
[1047.56 --> 1049.08]  They're getting legal hammers
[1049.08 --> 1050.06]  thrown onto their heads
[1050.06 --> 1051.00]  and they're just reacting
[1051.00 --> 1051.74]  because of it.
[1051.80 --> 1052.66]  That's not surprising.
[1053.14 --> 1053.90]  They're going to have to react
[1053.90 --> 1054.58]  in some way.
[1054.58 --> 1056.94]  Just allowing everyone
[1056.94 --> 1057.52]  and their mom
[1057.52 --> 1059.14]  to broadcast music for free.
[1059.82 --> 1060.10]  Yeah.
[1060.92 --> 1062.02]  Well, that's the problem is
[1062.02 --> 1063.22]  when you're a small company,
[1063.30 --> 1064.66]  you can take the liability, right?
[1064.72 --> 1065.58]  I mean, chances are
[1065.58 --> 1066.30]  they're not going to sue you
[1066.30 --> 1067.00]  unless they can make
[1067.00 --> 1068.34]  a massive amount of money.
[1068.38 --> 1069.60]  But look who owns them now, right?
[1069.96 --> 1070.14]  Yeah.
[1070.16 --> 1071.20]  I mean, there's big pockets
[1071.20 --> 1072.40]  now behind Twitch all of a sudden
[1072.40 --> 1073.70]  so they have to protect themselves.
[1074.32 --> 1075.50]  Someone in the chat said
[1075.50 --> 1076.72]  it's only for VODs
[1076.72 --> 1078.06]  but it's for 30-minute segments.
[1078.54 --> 1080.90]  So if they detect music
[1080.90 --> 1081.28]  or whatever,
[1081.38 --> 1082.60]  they'll mute you for 30 minutes
[1082.60 --> 1083.54]  which is interesting.
[1083.74 --> 1084.72]  So right now,
[1085.26 --> 1087.90]  I guess it's fine
[1087.90 --> 1089.40]  if you play it
[1089.40 --> 1090.12]  in your live stream.
[1090.38 --> 1091.00]  So everybody,
[1091.16 --> 1091.84]  increase your music
[1091.84 --> 1093.54]  to 1.2x speed
[1093.54 --> 1094.28]  when you're playing it
[1094.28 --> 1094.78]  in the background.
[1094.90 --> 1095.46]  It just fudges
[1095.46 --> 1096.20]  their whole algorithm.
[1097.64 --> 1099.22]  That would be really interesting.
[1099.34 --> 1099.94]  I wonder if you'd get
[1099.94 --> 1100.48]  in trouble for that
[1100.48 --> 1101.26]  but it would be really interesting
[1101.26 --> 1102.92]  to see attempting to break
[1102.92 --> 1103.92]  Twitch algorithm
[1103.92 --> 1105.64]  play at different speeds
[1105.64 --> 1106.96]  like mixing music
[1106.96 --> 1107.68]  play two songs
[1107.68 --> 1108.32]  at the same time
[1108.32 --> 1108.74]  or something.
[1109.18 --> 1109.84]  Yeah, I'd be curious
[1109.84 --> 1110.36]  to see what could
[1110.36 --> 1111.24]  defeat that algorithm.
[1111.24 --> 1113.28]  Someone should do it.
[1113.34 --> 1114.14]  Just try not to get banned.
[1114.46 --> 1114.96]  Maybe create like
[1114.96 --> 1115.80]  a second account
[1115.80 --> 1116.52]  that you don't use that.
[1116.52 --> 1117.34]  Yeah, and Luke and I
[1117.34 --> 1118.48]  don't condone that.
[1118.54 --> 1120.16]  We actually didn't say anything.
[1120.28 --> 1120.78]  Yeah, we didn't.
[1120.78 --> 1121.40]  This part of the stream
[1121.40 --> 1122.22]  is going to be muted
[1122.22 --> 1122.90]  in the VOD.
[1123.58 --> 1123.92]  Yep.
[1125.10 --> 1126.20]  So don't worry about it.
[1126.22 --> 1126.68]  They just muted us.
[1129.06 --> 1130.04]  That would be great.
[1130.18 --> 1131.40]  They have the descent algorithm.
[1131.52 --> 1131.74]  They're like,
[1131.78 --> 1132.74]  we have detected descent
[1132.74 --> 1133.60]  within the Twitch network.
[1133.80 --> 1134.24]  We must be...
[1134.24 --> 1136.82]  Let's get the NSA on this.
[1137.40 --> 1138.26]  All right, so next up
[1138.26 --> 1139.24]  we have the IBM
[1139.24 --> 1140.28]  brain-like chip
[1140.28 --> 1142.12]  which kind of blew my mind.
[1142.22 --> 1142.54]  Get it?
[1142.62 --> 1142.86]  Pun?
[1143.06 --> 1144.16]  When I first read about it.
[1144.40 --> 1145.14]  It has 1 million
[1145.14 --> 1146.16]  programmable neurons,
[1146.32 --> 1148.52]  256 million programmable synapses
[1148.52 --> 1151.50]  across 4,096 individual
[1151.50 --> 1153.58]  neurosynaptic cores
[1153.58 --> 1156.34]  with 5.4 billion transistors.
[1158.50 --> 1160.28]  This thing is a neuromorphic
[1160.98 --> 1162.34]  brain-like computer chip
[1162.34 --> 1163.28]  called TrueNorth
[1163.28 --> 1164.34]  which is built on top
[1164.34 --> 1166.30]  of Samsung's 28 nanometer process.
[1166.30 --> 1168.66]  It consumes just 72 milliwatts
[1168.66 --> 1169.78]  at max load
[1169.78 --> 1172.46]  and it is 176,000 times
[1172.46 --> 1173.02]  more efficient
[1173.02 --> 1174.10]  than a modern CPU
[1174.10 --> 1175.36]  running the same
[1175.36 --> 1176.80]  brain-like workload.
[1176.94 --> 1178.00]  So not doing just anything
[1178.00 --> 1180.62]  but running a brain-like workload.
[1180.96 --> 1182.74]  Whatever the crap that is.
[1184.42 --> 1185.56]  Kind of cool.
[1186.00 --> 1187.36]  They're talking about how
[1187.36 --> 1189.40]  it's the second generation version
[1189.40 --> 1191.30]  of one which was a prototype
[1191.30 --> 1192.00]  in 2011
[1192.00 --> 1194.92]  and it's pretty much ready to go
[1194.92 --> 1195.90]  for commercial application
[1195.90 --> 1197.54]  but I don't know
[1197.54 --> 1199.10]  where it's actually going to be used
[1199.10 --> 1199.94]  for commercial application.
[1200.08 --> 1201.06]  I see this more going to like
[1201.06 --> 1202.00]  research labs.
[1202.52 --> 1203.48]  This would definitely be
[1203.48 --> 1204.88]  probably in the research space.
[1205.08 --> 1205.22]  Yeah.
[1205.22 --> 1205.54]  Definitely.
[1205.80 --> 1206.26]  Because I don't know
[1206.26 --> 1207.36]  how many people need those
[1207.36 --> 1209.00]  like brain-like applications
[1209.56 --> 1211.00]  at least yet.
[1211.12 --> 1211.78]  I'm sure this will be
[1211.78 --> 1212.54]  in consumer devices
[1212.54 --> 1214.04]  in X amount of years
[1214.04 --> 1215.34]  but even though they say
[1215.34 --> 1216.14]  it's ready now
[1216.14 --> 1218.28]  I pretty much only see it in.
[1218.28 --> 1219.48]  Yeah, your future iPhone
[1219.48 --> 1220.40]  is going to be back talking
[1220.40 --> 1220.92]  you guys.
[1221.98 --> 1222.76]  So you're going to be like
[1222.76 --> 1223.74]  I don't feel like it.
[1224.76 --> 1226.70]  Hey, you didn't take me out
[1226.70 --> 1227.52]  for ice cream.
[1227.94 --> 1228.68]  Yeah, exactly.
[1229.04 --> 1229.58]  Oh my god.
[1229.68 --> 1230.28]  I'm not telling you
[1230.28 --> 1231.00]  where your car is.
[1231.42 --> 1232.84]  I'd imagine a CPU like this though.
[1232.90 --> 1233.62]  I mean this isn't designed
[1233.62 --> 1234.12]  for just running
[1234.12 --> 1235.56]  straight up binary operations.
[1236.04 --> 1237.90]  This is like multiple states.
[1238.64 --> 1239.88]  So you'd have to write
[1239.88 --> 1240.62]  custom software,
[1240.78 --> 1241.40]  custom compiler,
[1241.52 --> 1242.00]  all that stuff.
[1242.08 --> 1243.02]  So I'd be curious to see
[1243.02 --> 1244.18]  what they ultimately
[1244.18 --> 1244.88]  use that for.
[1245.00 --> 1246.36]  But the power consumption
[1246.36 --> 1247.22]  kind of blows my mind.
[1247.28 --> 1248.04]  I'm like why can they build
[1248.04 --> 1248.54]  something like this
[1248.54 --> 1249.68]  that consumes so little power?
[1249.68 --> 1251.22]  Yet a conventional CPU
[1251.22 --> 1252.50]  still can like heat your coffee.
[1253.08 --> 1253.82]  I think it's because
[1253.82 --> 1255.42]  they're so drastically different.
[1255.92 --> 1256.10]  Yeah.
[1256.18 --> 1256.94]  It doesn't have to be able
[1256.94 --> 1257.96]  to do all the different things
[1257.96 --> 1259.00]  that a CPU can do.
[1259.52 --> 1259.72]  Right.
[1260.98 --> 1261.88]  And even though they say
[1261.88 --> 1263.86]  it's like brain-like processes,
[1264.14 --> 1266.08]  how brain-like actually is it?
[1267.10 --> 1268.04]  Well, the last time
[1268.04 --> 1269.08]  you tried to calculate Pi
[1269.08 --> 1270.28]  out to like the 4 millionth place,
[1270.32 --> 1271.42]  how long did it take you to do it?
[1271.44 --> 1272.24]  Because the computer can do it
[1272.24 --> 1273.04]  in like three seconds.
[1273.28 --> 1273.56]  Yeah.
[1273.72 --> 1274.74]  So like maybe this thing's
[1274.74 --> 1275.38]  a lot more efficient
[1275.38 --> 1276.42]  at doing brain-like things
[1276.42 --> 1278.06]  because the CPU is actually faster
[1278.06 --> 1279.18]  and can't do it brain-like.
[1279.60 --> 1280.88]  They probably just got a brain-like
[1280.88 --> 1282.54]  because dumb just wouldn't sell chips.
[1282.88 --> 1284.00]  Like dumb chips.
[1285.60 --> 1287.96]  It is incredibly not as good.
[1288.30 --> 1289.56]  So it's much more efficient
[1289.56 --> 1290.72]  at being bad.
[1290.72 --> 1291.16]  Yeah.
[1291.32 --> 1292.32]  That's marketing for you.
[1292.56 --> 1292.80]  Yeah.
[1292.94 --> 1293.46]  Exactly.
[1293.46 --> 1296.46]  Our next-gen product,
[1296.68 --> 1298.18]  which is incredibly much better
[1298.18 --> 1299.40]  at being last-gen
[1299.40 --> 1300.54]  than the next-gen products
[1300.54 --> 1301.64]  of its competition.
[1303.24 --> 1305.84]  So news that's probably
[1305.84 --> 1307.24]  super close to your heart
[1307.24 --> 1309.50]  is Xbox One lost Microsoft
[1309.50 --> 1311.90]  400 million in gross margins last year.
[1312.00 --> 1313.80]  So they didn't just go down.
[1314.66 --> 1318.18]  It increased by $1.7 billion,
[1318.74 --> 1319.72]  their overall revenue,
[1319.72 --> 1323.12]  but it also cost them $2.1 billion
[1323.12 --> 1324.28]  to get there,
[1324.52 --> 1326.98]  which net a $400 million loss.
[1327.86 --> 1329.86]  So it's not that surprising.
[1330.28 --> 1331.52]  It's kind of to be expected
[1331.52 --> 1333.22]  with these massive launches,
[1333.52 --> 1334.46]  especially when it didn't sell
[1334.46 --> 1336.16]  quite as well as they expected.
[1336.46 --> 1337.54]  You have to do stuff like marketing,
[1337.74 --> 1339.02]  R&D, distribution,
[1339.26 --> 1340.08]  all that crap,
[1340.14 --> 1340.98]  and they have to pre-make
[1340.98 --> 1341.76]  all these machines.
[1341.92 --> 1342.76]  So they might even still have
[1342.76 --> 1344.02]  backstock of all this kind of stuff.
[1344.70 --> 1346.82]  And yeah, I don't know.
[1347.12 --> 1347.96]  Well, it's like I remember back
[1347.96 --> 1349.20]  when they made the Xbox 360.
[1349.36 --> 1350.04]  I mean, they were paying
[1350.04 --> 1351.90]  two and a half times
[1351.90 --> 1353.10]  the cost of the system
[1353.10 --> 1353.84]  to produce each one.
[1353.90 --> 1354.62]  So they were losing money
[1354.62 --> 1355.40]  hand over fist.
[1355.60 --> 1355.78]  Yep.
[1356.04 --> 1357.54]  And I'd imagine in this situation,
[1357.54 --> 1358.44]  it's probably not as bad.
[1358.48 --> 1359.12]  I'd hope they'd learn
[1359.12 --> 1359.72]  from their mistake.
[1359.78 --> 1360.68]  But still, in the beginning,
[1360.68 --> 1362.10]  you're going to take a huge hit, right?
[1363.00 --> 1364.98]  Yeah, I've heard it's not nearly as bad.
[1365.24 --> 1367.82]  And I know PlayStation 3
[1367.82 --> 1369.48]  and Xbox 360,
[1369.48 --> 1370.76]  they were both losing money
[1370.76 --> 1372.32]  when you bought just the core system.
[1372.50 --> 1373.98]  If you bought like a controller
[1373.98 --> 1375.46]  in the same basket,
[1375.68 --> 1376.98]  then they made money or whatever.
[1376.98 --> 1378.08]  I can't remember what the exact
[1378.08 --> 1378.94]  breakdown was.
[1379.20 --> 1381.26]  But with Xbox One and PS4,
[1381.32 --> 1382.12]  they were making money
[1382.12 --> 1383.42]  even on just the core system.
[1383.88 --> 1385.08]  So it's changed a bit.
[1385.50 --> 1386.62]  Do you remember on PS3
[1386.62 --> 1387.12]  when they were selling,
[1387.20 --> 1387.82]  people were buying them
[1387.82 --> 1388.96]  just as Blu-ray players?
[1389.18 --> 1389.44]  Yeah.
[1389.52 --> 1390.76]  They were losing money like crazy
[1390.76 --> 1391.98]  because just a factory
[1391.98 --> 1394.04]  run-of-the-mill Blu-ray player
[1394.04 --> 1394.74]  at the time was like
[1394.74 --> 1396.02]  $100 more expensive
[1396.02 --> 1396.80]  than buying the console
[1396.80 --> 1397.78]  that did the better job.
[1398.04 --> 1399.38]  And I know that that hurt them
[1399.38 --> 1400.38]  really bad in the beginning too.
[1400.46 --> 1400.92]  But honestly,
[1401.02 --> 1402.30]  I think the whole console things,
[1402.98 --> 1404.00]  I love consoles,
[1404.18 --> 1405.70]  but I think they just waited too long.
[1405.70 --> 1406.50]  I think 10 years
[1406.50 --> 1406.96]  and then coming out
[1406.96 --> 1407.54]  with other consoles,
[1407.68 --> 1408.56]  it's like everybody's kind of
[1408.56 --> 1409.60]  moved on to other things.
[1409.70 --> 1410.34]  Mobile gaming,
[1410.54 --> 1411.16]  desktop gaming.
[1411.26 --> 1411.74]  I think it's just,
[1411.82 --> 1412.52]  it's kind of killing
[1412.52 --> 1413.74]  that market down a little bit.
[1413.86 --> 1414.54]  And I think they did it
[1414.54 --> 1416.76]  like too little too late
[1416.76 --> 1418.12]  is probably the perfect,
[1418.28 --> 1419.50]  I think that's the first time
[1419.50 --> 1421.02]  I've ever used that perfectly
[1421.02 --> 1422.18]  is because it wasn't
[1422.18 --> 1423.40]  nearly strong enough
[1423.40 --> 1425.34]  and it was way too late.
[1425.40 --> 1426.96]  If they released this console
[1426.96 --> 1428.60]  a few years ago,
[1428.92 --> 1429.14]  maybe.
[1429.14 --> 1429.28]  Yeah.
[1429.28 --> 1430.00]  Well,
[1430.00 --> 1431.36]  I remember when the PS3 came out,
[1431.40 --> 1432.66]  it was like so beyond
[1432.66 --> 1433.94]  any generation of computer.
[1434.12 --> 1434.82]  People were actually
[1434.82 --> 1435.90]  taking that cell processor,
[1436.30 --> 1437.66]  dropping Linux distros on it
[1437.66 --> 1438.54]  and using it for processing
[1438.54 --> 1440.10]  because no conventional computer
[1440.10 --> 1440.62]  could do it.
[1440.94 --> 1441.10]  Yeah.
[1441.12 --> 1442.26]  And now you've got the Xbox One
[1442.26 --> 1442.96]  which pretty much has like
[1442.96 --> 1444.92]  two-year-old hardware in it.
[1445.10 --> 1445.30]  I mean,
[1446.42 --> 1447.04]  so I mean,
[1447.08 --> 1447.72]  there's like really,
[1448.12 --> 1449.12]  other than playing games on it,
[1449.12 --> 1449.80]  I guess there's no reason
[1449.80 --> 1450.22]  to go like,
[1450.26 --> 1450.46]  you know,
[1450.80 --> 1451.92]  try to find a cure for cancer
[1451.92 --> 1452.56]  with it or something.
[1452.56 --> 1453.28]  I can't remember
[1453.28 --> 1454.20]  if it was the Navy
[1454.20 --> 1454.94]  or the Army
[1454.94 --> 1455.82]  or the Air Force
[1455.82 --> 1456.24]  or whatever,
[1456.24 --> 1457.72]  but some military cell
[1457.72 --> 1458.56]  in the States
[1458.56 --> 1459.30]  was using
[1459.30 --> 1461.30]  PlayStation 3 clusters
[1461.30 --> 1462.26]  as servers.
[1462.98 --> 1463.08]  Oh,
[1463.16 --> 1463.72]  a lot of people
[1463.72 --> 1464.20]  were doing that.
[1464.42 --> 1464.48]  Yeah.
[1464.82 --> 1466.18]  The leading project on,
[1466.22 --> 1467.18]  so remember the SETI at home,
[1467.28 --> 1468.80]  the Search for Extra-Texture Telecom?
[1469.12 --> 1469.28]  Yeah,
[1469.34 --> 1469.94]  there was like some,
[1470.06 --> 1471.36]  the top ranking one
[1471.36 --> 1471.82]  in that list
[1471.82 --> 1472.46]  for like a year
[1472.46 --> 1474.04]  was just a bank of PS3s.
[1474.18 --> 1475.50]  It was so damn good
[1475.50 --> 1475.98]  at running those
[1475.98 --> 1476.74]  floating point numbers
[1476.74 --> 1477.62]  with that cell processor.
[1477.78 --> 1478.16]  It was awesome.
[1478.46 --> 1479.28]  That's pretty crazy.
[1479.48 --> 1481.14]  They've kind of abandoned that though
[1481.14 --> 1482.34]  and tried to be computers
[1482.34 --> 1483.68]  which they're not good at doing
[1483.68 --> 1485.38]  because straight up normal computers
[1485.38 --> 1486.10]  are much better than that.
[1486.24 --> 1487.42]  Speaking of which,
[1488.12 --> 1489.10]  there's been kind of a
[1489.10 --> 1490.08]  mass exodus.
[1490.32 --> 1491.40]  I guess mass exodus
[1491.40 --> 1492.92]  isn't as great anymore
[1492.92 --> 1494.22]  now that Halo isn't in this,
[1494.58 --> 1495.92]  but there's been an exodus
[1495.92 --> 1496.76]  of PC,
[1497.08 --> 1497.70]  sorry,
[1497.88 --> 1499.92]  Xbox One exclusive titles
[1499.92 --> 1501.52]  which have now gone to PC.
[1502.04 --> 1503.54]  So we saw Dead Rising 3
[1503.54 --> 1504.44]  not that long ago
[1504.44 --> 1506.02]  and now Rise has been announced.
[1506.48 --> 1507.64]  Rise is going to be coming
[1507.64 --> 1510.34]  with support for 4K resolution
[1510.34 --> 1511.96]  and it's also going to have
[1511.96 --> 1513.20]  downloadable extras
[1513.20 --> 1515.08]  from the console game.
[1515.08 --> 1515.88]  So it's going to have
[1515.88 --> 1517.02]  some nice little features
[1517.02 --> 1518.26]  for the PC
[1518.26 --> 1519.12]  that the console one
[1519.12 --> 1519.94]  didn't have
[1519.94 --> 1521.78]  kind of unlike Dead Risings
[1521.78 --> 1522.56]  which was slightly
[1522.56 --> 1524.02]  not the most graceful
[1524.02 --> 1525.58]  leap over to PC.
[1526.26 --> 1528.18]  Then everyone was super stoked
[1528.18 --> 1529.20]  including myself.
[1529.54 --> 1530.54]  I even went and like
[1530.54 --> 1531.64]  happily told my dad
[1531.64 --> 1532.14]  about this
[1532.14 --> 1533.14]  and then was super sad
[1533.14 --> 1533.92]  when it didn't happen.
[1534.30 --> 1536.60]  But the Halo Master Chief
[1536.60 --> 1537.20]  Collector's Edition
[1537.20 --> 1537.72]  for PC
[1537.72 --> 1539.64]  is apparently not coming
[1539.64 --> 1540.76]  to PC.
[1540.76 --> 1541.60]  Yeah,
[1541.84 --> 1543.22]  so it was posted
[1543.22 --> 1544.36]  on Amazon
[1544.36 --> 1545.82]  as you probably know
[1545.82 --> 1547.64]  and I was incredible.
[1547.76 --> 1548.48]  I even tried
[1548.48 --> 1549.72]  to like pre-order it.
[1550.08 --> 1551.16]  Did they even make a mouse?
[1551.24 --> 1551.64]  I thought they were
[1551.64 --> 1552.26]  selling a mouse
[1552.26 --> 1553.12]  that was themed after it.
[1553.12 --> 1553.82]  They've got a mouse
[1553.82 --> 1555.04]  that's themed after it
[1555.04 --> 1556.74]  but that's apparently unrelated.
[1557.32 --> 1558.52]  Aaron Greenberg
[1558.52 --> 1559.14]  has tweeted
[1559.14 --> 1560.42]  that it was
[1560.42 --> 1561.62]  an error at retail
[1561.62 --> 1563.16]  and he's apologizing
[1563.16 --> 1563.84]  for the confusion
[1563.84 --> 1564.50]  that it's caused.
[1564.68 --> 1566.36]  But I'm still going to hold off
[1566.36 --> 1567.54]  because I'm still not sure.
[1567.54 --> 1568.92]  I'm still willing to
[1568.92 --> 1571.36]  just hunker down
[1571.36 --> 1572.06]  and believe
[1572.06 --> 1573.16]  and I'm going to wait
[1573.16 --> 1574.30]  for Gamescom
[1574.30 --> 1575.76]  and PAX Prime.
[1576.56 --> 1577.20]  I love Halo.
[1577.32 --> 1577.58]  Honestly,
[1577.66 --> 1578.26]  out of all the titles
[1578.26 --> 1578.64]  you mentioned
[1578.64 --> 1579.32]  that's the only one
[1579.32 --> 1580.00]  I really cared about
[1580.00 --> 1580.56]  coming to PC.
[1580.80 --> 1581.68]  I would love to do
[1581.68 --> 1582.32]  multiplayer Halo.
[1582.34 --> 1582.62]  I completely agree.
[1583.98 --> 1585.26]  Maybe I'll pick up Rise
[1585.26 --> 1586.58]  in like two summer sales
[1586.58 --> 1586.92]  from now
[1586.92 --> 1587.48]  when it's $5
[1587.48 --> 1589.68]  and I'm not really
[1589.68 --> 1590.14]  that interested
[1590.14 --> 1591.12]  in picking up Dead Rising
[1591.12 --> 1592.36]  because who the hell cares.
[1593.40 --> 1594.22]  But Halo.
[1594.66 --> 1595.86]  Being able to play Halo 2
[1595.86 --> 1596.96]  online again
[1596.96 --> 1599.50]  As you can tell
[1599.50 --> 1600.12]  I love Halo.
[1600.26 --> 1600.86]  I 3D printed
[1600.86 --> 1601.92]  the freaking whole helmet.
[1602.12 --> 1603.34]  I got my little action figures.
[1603.42 --> 1604.46]  Dude, I love me some Halo.
[1604.72 --> 1605.40]  That's epic.
[1606.04 --> 1606.48]  So yeah,
[1606.64 --> 1608.56]  it's happened before.
[1608.64 --> 1609.06]  That's the thing.
[1609.16 --> 1610.48]  The Amazon UK site
[1610.48 --> 1611.54]  has leaked quite a few
[1611.54 --> 1612.20]  different games
[1612.20 --> 1613.26]  by posting them early.
[1613.66 --> 1614.82]  So I'm wondering
[1614.82 --> 1616.38]  I'm going to go with this
[1616.38 --> 1616.90]  actually
[1616.90 --> 1617.96]  just because I want it
[1617.96 --> 1618.94]  to happen so badly.
[1619.20 --> 1620.18]  There's no real reason
[1620.18 --> 1620.94]  for me to believe this
[1620.94 --> 1621.64]  at all
[1621.64 --> 1622.60]  but I'm just going to
[1622.60 --> 1623.46]  go with it anyways.
[1623.92 --> 1624.76]  Conspiracy theory.
[1624.98 --> 1625.60]  Yeah, exactly.
[1625.60 --> 1627.20]  I want to believe
[1627.20 --> 1627.86]  that that tweet
[1627.86 --> 1629.56]  is just to throw people off.
[1629.94 --> 1630.62]  It's just a cover up?
[1630.92 --> 1632.02]  I believe it.
[1632.02 --> 1632.14]  I'm going to go with
[1632.14 --> 1632.86]  it's just a cover up.
[1633.28 --> 1633.88]  Because maybe
[1633.88 --> 1634.86]  they're trying to get people
[1634.86 --> 1635.44]  to settle down
[1635.44 --> 1635.94]  for a little bit
[1635.94 --> 1637.10]  so they can explode again
[1637.10 --> 1637.82]  with Gamescom
[1637.82 --> 1638.52]  or PAX Prime.
[1639.86 --> 1640.26]  Please
[1640.26 --> 1641.44]  make that be the truth.
[1641.58 --> 1642.24]  And if it's not
[1642.24 --> 1643.68]  just make the damn thing.
[1643.76 --> 1644.46]  I don't care.
[1644.58 --> 1645.70]  Just bring it to PC.
[1646.28 --> 1647.64]  Just copy the last one
[1647.64 --> 1648.40]  port it to PC
[1648.40 --> 1649.42]  put a new number on it
[1649.42 --> 1649.62]  whatever
[1649.62 --> 1650.94]  just give it to us.
[1651.14 --> 1651.74]  Halo's already been
[1651.74 --> 1652.54]  on PC before
[1652.54 --> 1654.06]  just bring it back again.
[1654.06 --> 1655.66]  And people are still
[1655.66 --> 1656.50]  playing it today.
[1656.92 --> 1657.30]  They are.
[1657.52 --> 1657.92]  And do you remember
[1657.92 --> 1659.18]  what happened with Halo 2
[1659.18 --> 1660.16]  when they were shutting down
[1660.16 --> 1660.92]  the online servers?
[1661.92 --> 1662.26]  All the people
[1662.26 --> 1663.16]  that refused to disconnect.
[1664.02 --> 1664.54]  Oh really?
[1664.84 --> 1665.14]  Yeah.
[1665.28 --> 1665.76]  Oh my god.
[1665.82 --> 1665.98]  Okay.
[1666.10 --> 1666.92]  So they couldn't
[1666.92 --> 1667.54]  shut down the servers
[1667.54 --> 1668.46]  until everyone disconnected
[1668.46 --> 1669.04]  for some reason.
[1669.54 --> 1670.64]  And there were people
[1670.64 --> 1672.48]  that stayed in a game lobby
[1672.48 --> 1673.68]  that would just keep
[1673.68 --> 1674.14]  recreating
[1674.14 --> 1674.96]  I think
[1674.96 --> 1675.70]  was it one map
[1675.70 --> 1676.32]  or recreating maps?
[1676.40 --> 1676.72]  I don't remember
[1676.72 --> 1677.48]  but they just stayed
[1677.48 --> 1678.20]  in a game
[1678.20 --> 1679.42]  and refused to quit.
[1679.42 --> 1680.18]  And people were like
[1680.18 --> 1681.36]  donating the money
[1681.36 --> 1682.54]  to buy fans
[1682.54 --> 1683.82]  and AC units
[1683.82 --> 1684.18]  and stuff
[1684.18 --> 1684.72]  to try and keep
[1684.72 --> 1685.50]  their Xboxes running.
[1685.96 --> 1686.42]  And they stayed
[1686.42 --> 1687.20]  in that game
[1687.20 --> 1687.64]  I don't remember
[1687.64 --> 1688.14]  for how long
[1688.14 --> 1688.60]  but I think it was
[1688.60 --> 1689.36]  like a week or two
[1689.36 --> 1689.78]  or something
[1689.78 --> 1691.06]  and they just kept it going
[1691.06 --> 1691.54]  so they couldn't
[1691.54 --> 1692.26]  shut down the servers.
[1692.80 --> 1693.60]  And then eventually
[1693.60 --> 1695.06]  people were falling off
[1695.06 --> 1695.64]  because of
[1695.64 --> 1697.94]  console failure
[1697.94 --> 1699.04]  overheat
[1699.04 --> 1699.74]  Red Ring
[1699.74 --> 1700.10]  and whatnot
[1700.10 --> 1701.42]  and then finally
[1701.42 --> 1702.44]  it came down to one person
[1702.44 --> 1703.44]  and he or she
[1703.44 --> 1704.50]  lasted for a little while
[1704.50 --> 1705.60]  and then it finally died out.
[1705.90 --> 1707.62]  People liked Halo 2 online.
[1707.62 --> 1710.06]  I really liked Halo 2 online.
[1710.40 --> 1711.36]  It's the only console game
[1711.36 --> 1712.04]  that I've gone into
[1712.04 --> 1713.10]  like really heavily.
[1713.76 --> 1714.14]  No I was
[1714.14 --> 1714.86]  I love it.
[1714.94 --> 1715.74]  As far as console
[1715.74 --> 1717.54]  that's probably the one game
[1717.54 --> 1718.24]  that I love playing
[1718.24 --> 1719.40]  on console and on PC
[1719.40 --> 1720.34]  like the same.
[1720.56 --> 1721.52]  Like I love just sitting down
[1721.52 --> 1722.54]  and playing it on console
[1722.54 --> 1723.06]  but it's funny
[1723.06 --> 1723.60]  because this is probably
[1723.60 --> 1724.04]  the one time
[1724.04 --> 1724.74]  Microsoft was actually
[1724.74 --> 1725.48]  thankful that all the
[1725.48 --> 1726.24]  consoles were dying.
[1726.86 --> 1727.18]  Yeah.
[1727.42 --> 1727.70]  Yeah.
[1727.88 --> 1727.96]  Yeah.
[1727.96 --> 1728.24]  Exactly.
[1728.38 --> 1728.72]  Don't worry
[1728.72 --> 1729.62]  we ran the statistics
[1729.62 --> 1730.52]  they can only run the Xbox
[1730.52 --> 1732.06]  for 43.2 hours
[1732.06 --> 1732.92]  before it red rings.
[1733.46 --> 1734.30]  It will red ring.
[1734.64 --> 1735.24]  Linus go back
[1735.24 --> 1736.26]  and take care of your baby.
[1736.72 --> 1737.50]  Get out of the chat.
[1737.62 --> 1738.44]  Oh is he in here?
[1738.64 --> 1739.68]  He's in the chat.
[1740.90 --> 1741.66]  What a nerd.
[1741.68 --> 1742.18]  Just ignore
[1742.18 --> 1742.74]  just right click
[1742.74 --> 1743.34]  and ignore him.
[1743.58 --> 1744.44]  Like just get him out of here.
[1744.50 --> 1745.88]  Large Linus is here today.
[1746.20 --> 1747.44]  Linus needs to take care
[1747.44 --> 1748.52]  of his spawn.
[1748.94 --> 1750.62]  Go take care of your spawn Linus.
[1752.50 --> 1752.90]  Yeah.
[1753.22 --> 1753.94]  So like I said
[1753.94 --> 1754.90]  there was the
[1754.90 --> 1756.22]  there was the mouse
[1756.22 --> 1757.52]  which had a lot of people
[1757.52 --> 1758.62]  thinking that the
[1758.62 --> 1759.82]  Halo Master Chiefs collection
[1759.82 --> 1761.00]  was already coming to PC.
[1761.18 --> 1761.74]  Just the mouse
[1761.74 --> 1762.66]  made people think that.
[1763.00 --> 1763.72]  And then when there was
[1763.72 --> 1764.46]  the so and so
[1764.46 --> 1765.64]  false posting on Amazon
[1765.64 --> 1766.26]  it made people think
[1766.26 --> 1766.82]  that even more.
[1766.94 --> 1767.80]  So I don't know.
[1768.18 --> 1768.90]  Hopefully it happens
[1768.90 --> 1770.38]  but there's less than
[1770.38 --> 1771.70]  no guarantee at this point.
[1772.42 --> 1773.24]  I'm with you though.
[1773.30 --> 1774.36]  I'm holding on to the conspiracy.
[1774.94 --> 1775.30]  Me too.
[1775.48 --> 1776.50]  It's not even that far away
[1776.50 --> 1777.52]  so I won't even feel that bad
[1777.52 --> 1778.26]  if it doesn't come true
[1778.26 --> 1780.02]  because Gamescom and PAX
[1780.02 --> 1781.02]  are both within
[1781.02 --> 1781.86]  like a month.
[1782.34 --> 1783.24]  Hey should we just
[1783.24 --> 1784.26]  Half-Life 3 this thing
[1784.26 --> 1785.06]  and just encourage everybody
[1785.06 --> 1786.08]  to go create the confirmed
[1786.08 --> 1786.64]  memes for it?
[1786.64 --> 1787.66]  We're going to Half-Life 3
[1787.66 --> 1788.84]  but later on in the show.
[1789.10 --> 1789.60]  Okay good.
[1789.80 --> 1790.54]  That'll happen.
[1790.68 --> 1791.12]  Trust me.
[1791.44 --> 1791.80]  Okay.
[1791.94 --> 1792.72]  Did you read this topic?
[1792.80 --> 1794.08]  This seems right up your alley.
[1794.22 --> 1795.08]  The cat caller
[1795.08 --> 1795.82]  that searches for
[1795.82 --> 1797.06]  vulnerable Wi-Fi hotspots?
[1798.08 --> 1798.44]  No.
[1798.90 --> 1799.76]  Do you know what
[1799.76 --> 1800.40]  war driving is?
[1800.46 --> 1800.96]  I'm assuming you know
[1800.96 --> 1801.18]  war driving.
[1801.18 --> 1802.52]  Oh dude I used to war drive.
[1802.84 --> 1804.00]  Can I just tell you
[1804.00 --> 1804.96]  just a really quick story?
[1805.08 --> 1805.28]  Do it.
[1805.32 --> 1806.58]  At one point I had a car PC.
[1806.72 --> 1807.34]  I built a completely
[1807.34 --> 1808.34]  custom car PC.
[1808.48 --> 1809.16]  I'll post pictures.
[1809.26 --> 1810.22]  I even fiberglass screen
[1810.22 --> 1810.94]  in the dashboard.
[1811.18 --> 1812.04]  Ran Windows XP.
[1812.22 --> 1814.10]  Had a drawer in the trunk.
[1814.24 --> 1814.42]  Everything.
[1814.56 --> 1815.54]  Anyways I had a USB
[1815.54 --> 1816.84]  wireless access point
[1816.84 --> 1817.52]  that went up
[1817.52 --> 1818.46]  that was on the rear deck.
[1818.46 --> 1819.64]  And at one point
[1819.64 --> 1820.42]  between Microsoft
[1820.42 --> 1821.46]  and my house
[1821.46 --> 1822.82]  I was able to set up
[1822.82 --> 1823.66]  a route where I could
[1823.66 --> 1824.78]  jump from one Wi-Fi
[1824.78 --> 1825.52]  to another
[1825.52 --> 1826.72]  between two access points
[1826.72 --> 1827.72]  and seamlessly maintain
[1827.72 --> 1828.52]  my internet connection
[1828.52 --> 1829.08]  all the way home.
[1829.12 --> 1829.76]  So I could stream
[1829.76 --> 1830.56]  like YouTube,
[1830.78 --> 1831.60]  music on Pandora,
[1831.72 --> 1832.38]  everything with no
[1832.38 --> 1833.04]  cellular signal
[1833.04 --> 1833.78]  all the way from
[1833.78 --> 1834.26]  the time I left
[1834.26 --> 1834.72]  the parking lot
[1834.72 --> 1835.18]  to the time I pulled
[1835.18 --> 1835.76]  into my driveway.
[1835.96 --> 1836.72]  Super beast.
[1836.88 --> 1838.14]  I may or may not
[1838.14 --> 1838.90]  have done that
[1838.90 --> 1840.02]  when I used to work
[1840.02 --> 1841.28]  somewhere and I did it
[1841.28 --> 1842.60]  my drive between
[1842.60 --> 1843.38]  home and there as well.
[1843.80 --> 1844.82]  But yeah that's called
[1844.82 --> 1845.58]  war driving.
[1845.74 --> 1846.70]  So essentially you
[1846.70 --> 1847.76]  used to drive
[1847.76 --> 1848.48]  through an area,
[1848.92 --> 1850.62]  bike, car, whatever
[1850.62 --> 1851.82]  and have your laptop
[1851.82 --> 1852.90]  pick up vulnerable
[1852.90 --> 1854.40]  or completely
[1854.40 --> 1855.22]  unencrypted
[1855.22 --> 1856.06]  wireless networks
[1856.06 --> 1856.82]  so that you can
[1856.82 --> 1858.56]  create this like map
[1858.56 --> 1859.80]  of insecure,
[1860.06 --> 1861.06]  unsecure wireless networks
[1861.06 --> 1861.62]  that you can connect
[1861.62 --> 1862.48]  to along your way
[1862.48 --> 1863.26]  to whatever route.
[1863.60 --> 1864.64]  Or just gathering
[1864.64 --> 1865.46]  information on a whole
[1865.46 --> 1866.44]  bunch of potentially
[1866.44 --> 1867.46]  vulnerable points.
[1867.84 --> 1868.84]  So someone has
[1868.84 --> 1869.88]  taken that idea
[1869.88 --> 1871.10]  and adapted it
[1871.10 --> 1872.32]  to a cat.
[1872.80 --> 1874.08]  So he has
[1874.08 --> 1874.94]  outfitted his cat
[1874.94 --> 1876.08]  Coco with a
[1876.08 --> 1877.10]  specially made collar
[1877.10 --> 1878.52]  built from a Wi-Fi
[1878.52 --> 1880.00]  card, a GPS module,
[1880.16 --> 1880.62]  a battery,
[1880.90 --> 1882.28]  and a spark cord chip.
[1882.28 --> 1882.62]  Oh my god.
[1883.04 --> 1883.94]  The device runs
[1883.94 --> 1884.58]  custom software
[1884.58 --> 1885.00]  that looks for
[1885.00 --> 1885.68]  Wi-Fi signals
[1885.68 --> 1886.18]  like we were just
[1886.18 --> 1887.18]  saying and records
[1887.18 --> 1888.04]  ones that are open
[1888.04 --> 1888.98]  or poorly protected
[1888.98 --> 1890.06]  with old encryption
[1890.06 --> 1891.94]  like WEP which is
[1891.94 --> 1893.40]  like useless at this
[1893.40 --> 1893.84]  point in time
[1893.84 --> 1894.22]  essentially.
[1894.82 --> 1895.68]  So I thought that
[1895.68 --> 1896.10]  was absolutely
[1896.10 --> 1896.74]  fantastic.
[1897.32 --> 1898.80]  There used to be
[1898.80 --> 1899.74]  a database online
[1899.74 --> 1899.92]  too.
[1900.00 --> 1900.50]  I remember that
[1900.50 --> 1901.34]  certain war dialing
[1901.34 --> 1902.08]  software that you ran
[1902.08 --> 1902.38]  would actually
[1902.38 --> 1902.94]  upload at the
[1902.94 --> 1904.00]  database so everybody
[1904.00 --> 1904.98]  could search for
[1904.98 --> 1905.48]  these unsecure
[1905.48 --> 1906.02]  networks even
[1906.02 --> 1906.98]  without identifying
[1906.98 --> 1907.48]  them first.
[1907.94 --> 1908.32]  Yeah, no, no,
[1908.34 --> 1909.20]  that was a really
[1909.20 --> 1909.86]  big deal but that's
[1909.86 --> 1910.74]  clever to attach to
[1910.74 --> 1911.26]  your cat and just
[1911.26 --> 1911.86]  let them go roam
[1911.86 --> 1912.40]  the neighborhood
[1912.40 --> 1913.46]  and find you
[1913.46 --> 1913.86]  networks.
[1914.04 --> 1914.80]  That's pretty
[1914.80 --> 1915.14]  hilarious.
[1915.30 --> 1915.60]  And then you can
[1915.60 --> 1916.20]  put a high gain
[1916.20 --> 1916.80]  antenna on your
[1916.80 --> 1917.34]  house and reach
[1917.34 --> 1917.96]  out and grab
[1917.96 --> 1918.08]  them.
[1920.38 --> 1921.02]  I thought that
[1921.02 --> 1921.48]  was kind of
[1921.48 --> 1921.76]  funny.
[1922.46 --> 1923.48]  It's just, I
[1923.48 --> 1924.18]  think it's cool.
[1924.36 --> 1925.20]  It maybe sucks for
[1925.20 --> 1925.60]  people that don't
[1925.60 --> 1926.26]  have secure networks
[1926.26 --> 1927.18]  but I think it's a
[1927.18 --> 1927.96]  cool little project.
[1928.24 --> 1928.84]  I can't believe you
[1928.84 --> 1929.48]  made that thing.
[1930.34 --> 1931.08]  I think that would be
[1931.08 --> 1932.34]  hilarious because you
[1932.34 --> 1933.38]  can't map where your
[1933.38 --> 1934.16]  cat goes to.
[1934.16 --> 1934.98]  So you can see if
[1934.98 --> 1935.94]  it has like a
[1935.94 --> 1936.80]  secondary family.
[1937.42 --> 1937.58]  Yeah.
[1937.58 --> 1938.12]  If your chat's
[1938.12 --> 1938.76]  cheating on you,
[1939.14 --> 1939.84]  the cat is cheating
[1939.84 --> 1940.46]  on you, maybe with
[1940.46 --> 1941.08]  someone with very
[1941.08 --> 1942.04]  insecure, crappy
[1942.04 --> 1942.54]  Wi-Fi.
[1942.84 --> 1943.52]  I don't think people
[1943.52 --> 1944.34]  should be like jumping
[1944.34 --> 1945.04]  on other people's
[1945.04 --> 1945.74]  networks and stuff
[1945.74 --> 1946.70]  like that but honestly
[1946.70 --> 1947.84]  it's one of those
[1947.84 --> 1949.08]  things where by
[1949.08 --> 1949.84]  identifying the
[1949.84 --> 1950.42]  network and getting
[1950.42 --> 1950.84]  it out there,
[1950.90 --> 1951.58]  hopefully it causes
[1951.58 --> 1952.20]  them to close the
[1952.20 --> 1952.38]  hole.
[1952.84 --> 1953.48]  Like I remember
[1953.48 --> 1954.00]  back in the day
[1954.00 --> 1954.64]  people used to just
[1954.64 --> 1955.74]  connect to unsecure
[1955.74 --> 1956.46]  networks and find
[1956.46 --> 1957.26]  shared printers on
[1957.26 --> 1957.84]  your computer because
[1957.84 --> 1958.56]  inside your house
[1958.56 --> 1959.00]  you usually don't
[1959.00 --> 1959.66]  secure your network.
[1959.90 --> 1960.28]  A lot of people
[1960.28 --> 1961.04]  didn't back in the
[1961.04 --> 1961.20]  day.
[1961.62 --> 1962.70]  So you'd be sitting
[1962.70 --> 1962.94]  there and your
[1962.94 --> 1963.32]  printer would just
[1963.32 --> 1964.30]  be spitting out
[1964.30 --> 1964.80]  sheets of paper
[1964.80 --> 1965.60]  like, oh hey,
[1965.72 --> 1967.04]  I'm printing this,
[1967.12 --> 1967.44]  I'm printing this,
[1967.48 --> 1967.78]  I'm on your
[1967.78 --> 1968.26]  network, I'm on
[1968.26 --> 1968.50]  your network.
[1968.58 --> 1968.76]  And then they're
[1968.76 --> 1969.24]  like, oh crap,
[1969.28 --> 1969.78]  I better go figure
[1969.78 --> 1970.14]  out what's going
[1970.14 --> 1970.44]  on.
[1971.06 --> 1972.68]  So at least sometimes
[1972.68 --> 1973.66]  it helps them find
[1973.66 --> 1974.32]  it or your cable
[1974.32 --> 1975.08]  provider comes out
[1975.08 --> 1975.66]  and goes, oh yeah,
[1975.80 --> 1976.38]  you've been sharing
[1976.38 --> 1978.32]  movies for like six
[1978.32 --> 1978.76]  months off your
[1978.76 --> 1979.34]  connection and this
[1979.34 --> 1980.08]  little old lady's
[1980.08 --> 1980.58]  like, what's a
[1980.58 --> 1981.28]  share movie?
[1982.14 --> 1983.72]  It's like, I don't
[1983.72 --> 1984.10]  understand.
[1984.64 --> 1985.40]  I don't know.
[1985.74 --> 1986.48]  Oh my God, that's
[1986.48 --> 1987.26]  priceless though, man.
[1987.36 --> 1988.40]  I didn't read that.
[1988.48 --> 1989.16]  That's awesome.
[1989.84 --> 1990.60]  I don't know.
[1990.72 --> 1991.50]  I used to, like I
[1991.50 --> 1992.00]  said, I used to do
[1992.00 --> 1992.46]  it back in the day,
[1992.48 --> 1993.18]  but mostly what
[1993.18 --> 1993.68]  you're going to get
[1993.68 --> 1994.66]  is stuff like coffee
[1994.66 --> 1995.64]  shops or whatever.
[1996.50 --> 1997.28]  I don't know if
[1997.28 --> 1998.24]  this is super common
[1998.24 --> 1999.42]  in the States, but
[1999.42 --> 1999.96]  one thing that's
[1999.96 --> 2000.72]  pretty big up here,
[2000.76 --> 2002.24]  at least in BC, is
[2002.24 --> 2002.96]  different coffee shops
[2002.96 --> 2003.84]  will have this thing
[2003.84 --> 2005.72]  called Shaw Open.
[2006.00 --> 2006.64]  Shaw is one of the
[2006.64 --> 2007.96]  ISP providers and
[2007.96 --> 2008.88]  they'll put routers
[2008.88 --> 2009.74]  in these coffee shops
[2009.74 --> 2012.08]  and secure them, but
[2012.08 --> 2012.84]  they show up as
[2012.84 --> 2014.22]  unsecured networks.
[2014.70 --> 2015.36]  It's like the
[2015.36 --> 2016.58]  browser login style.
[2018.10 --> 2018.98]  That's really common
[2018.98 --> 2019.54]  down here also.
[2019.64 --> 2020.02]  I think even
[2020.02 --> 2020.94]  Starbucks down here,
[2020.94 --> 2021.66]  they give you
[2021.66 --> 2022.40]  access, but you
[2022.40 --> 2022.82]  have to go through
[2022.82 --> 2023.32]  a webpage and
[2023.32 --> 2023.78]  agree to their
[2023.78 --> 2024.40]  terms of service
[2024.40 --> 2024.70]  first.
[2024.82 --> 2025.80]  Yeah, and that
[2025.80 --> 2026.68]  would be super
[2026.68 --> 2028.86]  annoying, but
[2028.86 --> 2031.32]  oh well, too bad.
[2031.40 --> 2031.92]  I did it when I
[2031.92 --> 2032.52]  was still learning.
[2033.32 --> 2034.20]  One thing that you
[2034.20 --> 2034.76]  might be interested
[2034.76 --> 2036.58]  in, actually, while
[2036.58 --> 2037.20]  we're on the whole
[2037.20 --> 2038.20]  programming learning
[2038.20 --> 2039.68]  topic, is we
[2039.68 --> 2041.08]  started filming a
[2041.08 --> 2042.94]  Superfund today, but
[2042.94 --> 2044.06]  as this week has
[2044.06 --> 2045.02]  been pretty crazy,
[2045.44 --> 2046.40]  and both the
[2046.40 --> 2047.14]  editing and film
[2047.14 --> 2048.06]  guys have no free
[2048.06 --> 2048.88]  time because they're
[2048.88 --> 2049.88]  drastically behind
[2049.88 --> 2052.24]  catch up.
[2053.36 --> 2054.32]  I had to think of
[2054.32 --> 2055.12]  some way to do a
[2055.12 --> 2056.08]  Superfund which
[2056.08 --> 2056.96]  wouldn't take up a
[2056.96 --> 2057.90]  ton of their time.
[2058.12 --> 2058.98]  So I decided to
[2058.98 --> 2059.88]  troll the absolute
[2059.88 --> 2061.06]  crap out of
[2061.06 --> 2062.42]  Terran, one of the
[2062.42 --> 2063.16]  guys at our work,
[2063.58 --> 2064.38]  and the way that I
[2064.38 --> 2065.24]  did it was by using
[2065.24 --> 2066.66]  a screen melter
[2066.66 --> 2067.06]  program.
[2068.10 --> 2069.12]  So I'm sure you
[2069.12 --> 2069.72]  know about those.
[2070.10 --> 2070.32]  Oh yeah.
[2070.52 --> 2071.28]  And I was thinking
[2071.28 --> 2071.88]  you might be able to
[2071.88 --> 2073.02]  make a partner video
[2073.02 --> 2074.90]  for our Superfund on
[2074.90 --> 2075.64]  how to make one,
[2075.64 --> 2076.34]  which I think would
[2076.34 --> 2076.86]  be pretty cool,
[2077.24 --> 2078.22]  with your, I don't
[2078.22 --> 2078.66]  remember what it's
[2078.66 --> 2079.98]  called, CodeCamp or
[2079.98 --> 2080.20]  whatever.
[2080.98 --> 2081.30]  Codegasm.
[2081.84 --> 2082.42]  Codegasm, yeah.
[2082.66 --> 2083.22]  So if you make a
[2083.22 --> 2083.96]  Codegasm video that
[2083.96 --> 2084.90]  goes along with the
[2084.90 --> 2085.74]  Channel Superfund video,
[2085.80 --> 2086.26]  you can show people
[2086.26 --> 2086.90]  how to do it.
[2087.04 --> 2087.84]  It's all about the
[2087.84 --> 2088.62]  SEO, man.
[2088.68 --> 2089.04]  It's like when you
[2089.04 --> 2090.06]  put gasm on the end
[2090.06 --> 2090.96]  of things, people run
[2090.96 --> 2092.26]  into it on accident for
[2092.26 --> 2092.62]  some reason.
[2092.72 --> 2093.26]  I don't know why.
[2093.42 --> 2094.16]  I don't know why
[2094.16 --> 2094.68]  they would do that.
[2094.96 --> 2095.60]  I don't know.
[2095.68 --> 2095.94]  I don't know.
[2096.36 --> 2097.06]  No, no, definitely
[2097.06 --> 2098.86]  talk to me after the
[2098.86 --> 2098.98]  show.
[2099.06 --> 2099.98]  We can definitely do an
[2099.98 --> 2100.68]  episode on how to
[2100.68 --> 2101.82]  create prank apps because
[2101.82 --> 2103.08]  I've probably created
[2103.08 --> 2104.02]  hundreds of them over
[2104.02 --> 2104.96]  the last 15 years at
[2104.96 --> 2106.30]  Microsoft, and most of
[2106.30 --> 2106.70]  them were pretty
[2106.70 --> 2107.58]  successful because I
[2107.58 --> 2108.44]  know all the little
[2108.44 --> 2109.22]  nooks and crannies to
[2109.22 --> 2109.88]  put things where people
[2109.88 --> 2110.36]  can't find it.
[2111.20 --> 2112.02]  That's fantastic.
[2112.38 --> 2113.48]  I did it in a super
[2113.48 --> 2114.08]  ghetto way.
[2114.20 --> 2115.22]  I had a fairly elegant
[2115.22 --> 2116.02]  way that I was planning
[2116.02 --> 2116.56]  on doing it.
[2116.62 --> 2117.70]  Because he's running a
[2117.70 --> 2118.40]  hard drive in his
[2118.40 --> 2119.54]  system, I put it on
[2119.54 --> 2120.62]  the startup so that he
[2120.62 --> 2121.24]  would hopefully turn
[2121.24 --> 2122.46]  his computer on and
[2122.46 --> 2123.48]  then sit there while
[2123.48 --> 2124.30]  other things are
[2124.30 --> 2125.04]  loading, and then all
[2125.04 --> 2125.46]  of a sudden it would
[2125.46 --> 2126.28]  just randomly happen,
[2126.38 --> 2127.74]  at least in his eyes.
[2128.14 --> 2129.28]  But he turned his
[2129.28 --> 2130.16]  computer on knowing that
[2130.16 --> 2130.94]  it had a hard drive and
[2130.94 --> 2132.24]  just walked away because
[2132.24 --> 2132.96]  it was going to take
[2132.96 --> 2133.82]  so long to boot.
[2134.30 --> 2135.06]  So I had to think of
[2135.06 --> 2135.68]  some other way of
[2135.68 --> 2136.08]  doing it.
[2136.22 --> 2137.22]  So instead of setting
[2137.22 --> 2138.32]  up a timer or anything
[2138.32 --> 2139.26]  more elegant like that,
[2139.38 --> 2140.24]  I just plugged a mouse
[2140.24 --> 2141.38]  in and waited for him
[2141.38 --> 2141.94]  to be using his
[2141.94 --> 2142.62]  computer, and then I
[2142.62 --> 2143.86]  launched it while he
[2143.86 --> 2145.12]  was using his computer.
[2145.64 --> 2146.20]  That's awesome.
[2146.46 --> 2147.42]  I actually have a
[2147.42 --> 2148.14]  program I want to
[2148.14 --> 2149.46]  give you to go prank
[2149.46 --> 2150.54]  somebody one time.
[2151.02 --> 2152.46]  I called it Tourette's.
[2153.14 --> 2153.56]  Don't, don't, don't.
[2153.64 --> 2154.10]  I know what you're
[2154.10 --> 2154.46]  talking about.
[2154.72 --> 2155.02]  Don't.
[2155.32 --> 2156.54]  Okay, I made this
[2156.54 --> 2156.90]  program.
[2157.16 --> 2157.78]  I'll go find the
[2157.78 --> 2158.54]  source code for it and
[2158.54 --> 2158.94]  send it to you.
[2159.00 --> 2159.46]  It's priceless.
[2159.60 --> 2160.36]  Okay, cool.
[2160.68 --> 2161.88]  Well, I'll use that.
[2161.88 --> 2162.42]  I just don't want
[2162.42 --> 2162.92]  people to know what
[2162.92 --> 2163.46]  it is yet.
[2165.46 --> 2166.62]  It must be malicious.
[2166.94 --> 2167.66]  I'll even show you how
[2167.66 --> 2168.24]  to hide it so they
[2168.24 --> 2168.94]  can't find it.
[2169.16 --> 2169.44]  Perfect.
[2169.78 --> 2170.38]  Let's see.
[2170.56 --> 2171.26]  Oh my gosh.
[2171.34 --> 2171.76]  Oh, continue.
[2172.20 --> 2172.82]  Okay, okay.
[2172.82 --> 2173.22]  We're going to move
[2173.22 --> 2173.38]  on.
[2173.56 --> 2174.28]  So we're going to get
[2174.28 --> 2177.12]  to the topic that you
[2177.12 --> 2177.98]  really didn't like,
[2178.22 --> 2180.12]  but the NVIDIA physics
[2180.12 --> 2181.96]  disabled when a non-NVIDIA
[2181.96 --> 2183.34]  GPU is detected in your
[2183.34 --> 2183.70]  system.
[2183.70 --> 2188.04]  I just can't see the
[2188.04 --> 2188.80]  reason for them doing
[2188.80 --> 2188.88]  it.
[2188.88 --> 2189.54]  I mean, the only, I
[2189.54 --> 2190.46]  guess the only reason I
[2190.46 --> 2191.02]  could see them wanting
[2191.02 --> 2191.78]  to do something like
[2191.78 --> 2192.46]  this is that they don't
[2192.46 --> 2193.32]  want to be held liable
[2193.32 --> 2194.36]  for bugs and stuff that
[2194.36 --> 2195.16]  are exposed through the
[2195.16 --> 2196.02]  incompatibility because
[2196.02 --> 2196.92]  they don't own the whole
[2196.92 --> 2198.12]  hardware ecosystem at that
[2198.12 --> 2198.36]  point.
[2198.58 --> 2200.18]  Their excuse is, uh,
[2200.20 --> 2201.26]  NVIDIA says high quality
[2201.26 --> 2202.32]  experience in such a
[2202.32 --> 2203.14]  scenario cannot be
[2203.14 --> 2205.64]  guaranteed, but guys,
[2205.90 --> 2206.36]  come on.
[2206.42 --> 2206.94]  People have been using
[2206.94 --> 2208.08]  this for so long.
[2209.32 --> 2210.70]  It was fine.
[2210.70 --> 2211.74]  I've literally never
[2211.74 --> 2213.08]  heard anyone complain
[2213.08 --> 2214.12]  about it at all.
[2214.72 --> 2217.40]  So no, I think it's
[2217.40 --> 2218.44]  just a play to force
[2218.44 --> 2219.80]  force upgrade to ATI.
[2220.04 --> 2221.72]  I mean, yeah, like I
[2221.72 --> 2223.14]  love you guys, but no,
[2223.58 --> 2224.48]  so that this is coming
[2224.48 --> 2225.82]  in, in NVIDIA's new
[2225.82 --> 2229.88]  three, um, it's going
[2229.88 --> 2230.72]  to be enabling shield
[2230.72 --> 2231.74]  tablet features, but
[2231.74 --> 2232.42]  it's also going to have
[2232.42 --> 2233.02]  the feature where it
[2233.02 --> 2234.22]  disables your physics
[2234.22 --> 2234.66]  GPU.
[2234.92 --> 2236.32]  So if you're trying to
[2236.32 --> 2238.26]  run like a beast R9
[2238.26 --> 2239.24]  card and a little
[2239.24 --> 2240.22]  NVIDIA card for physics,
[2240.22 --> 2241.48]  maybe not going to
[2241.48 --> 2242.20]  work anymore, or
[2242.20 --> 2242.62]  you're going to have
[2242.62 --> 2243.76]  to run older drivers,
[2243.86 --> 2244.62]  which you can do.
[2244.68 --> 2245.20]  Just make sure you
[2245.20 --> 2245.78]  don't update your
[2245.78 --> 2246.82]  drivers beyond that
[2246.82 --> 2248.44]  for, for this to
[2248.44 --> 2248.66]  work.
[2248.70 --> 2249.36]  And then maybe you'll
[2249.36 --> 2250.02]  run into problems in
[2250.02 --> 2250.58]  the future, but at
[2250.58 --> 2251.12]  least work for a
[2251.12 --> 2251.82]  little while now.
[2252.44 --> 2254.70]  Um, yeah, I don't
[2254.70 --> 2254.90]  know.
[2254.94 --> 2256.24]  Not, not cool.
[2256.70 --> 2257.62]  I'm not super stoked
[2257.62 --> 2258.30]  for this personally.
[2258.30 --> 2258.82]  That's not the
[2258.82 --> 2259.62]  scenario that I run,
[2259.68 --> 2260.48]  but I do know people
[2260.48 --> 2261.80]  personally that do run
[2261.80 --> 2262.92]  this scenario and it
[2262.92 --> 2263.72]  will affect them.
[2263.82 --> 2264.48]  And obviously, like I
[2264.48 --> 2264.98]  just said, they'll be
[2264.98 --> 2265.70]  able to last for a
[2265.70 --> 2266.94]  while by just not
[2266.94 --> 2268.42]  upgrading their driver
[2268.42 --> 2269.06]  software at all.
[2269.06 --> 2270.68]  But that's going to
[2270.68 --> 2271.66]  eventually not be a
[2271.66 --> 2272.60]  very elegant solution.
[2273.22 --> 2273.68]  Well, looking at it
[2273.68 --> 2274.20]  from the marketing
[2274.20 --> 2275.32]  standpoint, I mean,
[2275.44 --> 2276.98]  obviously, if people
[2276.98 --> 2278.28]  can get a good
[2278.28 --> 2279.44]  physics experience from
[2279.44 --> 2280.42]  a cheap little GPU
[2280.42 --> 2281.04]  that's no longer
[2281.04 --> 2281.96]  relevant or supported,
[2282.52 --> 2283.18]  you know, that's not
[2283.18 --> 2284.18]  good business for them.
[2284.32 --> 2284.84]  You know, they want
[2284.84 --> 2286.02]  you to run their
[2286.02 --> 2286.44]  product.
[2286.44 --> 2288.28]  So by cutting off the
[2288.28 --> 2289.00]  competition and saying,
[2289.12 --> 2289.74]  okay, you have to be
[2289.74 --> 2290.28]  running NVIDIA
[2290.28 --> 2291.70]  everything to get
[2291.70 --> 2292.50]  physics, some of those
[2292.50 --> 2293.42]  people may actually like
[2293.42 --> 2293.70]  that.
[2293.78 --> 2294.52]  That may be enough to,
[2294.72 --> 2295.48]  you know, just put them
[2295.48 --> 2296.06]  over the top.
[2296.40 --> 2296.62]  Yeah.
[2296.72 --> 2297.60]  And go get it.
[2301.36 --> 2302.40]  So it's not going to
[2302.40 --> 2303.10]  affect stuff like if you
[2303.10 --> 2303.86]  have onboard Intel
[2303.86 --> 2304.58]  chips or anything like
[2304.58 --> 2304.76]  that.
[2304.80 --> 2305.34]  So don't worry.
[2305.44 --> 2306.46]  I saw one person in
[2306.46 --> 2306.84]  the chat.
[2307.24 --> 2307.94]  Forget about that.
[2308.12 --> 2309.28]  It's just like dedicated
[2309.28 --> 2310.38]  car differentials.
[2311.98 --> 2312.86]  I don't know.
[2312.98 --> 2314.52]  This is just not really
[2314.52 --> 2314.96]  cool.
[2315.22 --> 2316.84]  I can't say I'm surprised
[2316.84 --> 2319.34]  to be honest, but I
[2319.34 --> 2320.30]  didn't expect it.
[2321.02 --> 2321.24]  I just.
[2321.52 --> 2322.60]  Yeah, it just seems like
[2322.60 --> 2323.24]  it seems like they
[2323.24 --> 2324.06]  actually had to go out
[2324.06 --> 2324.66]  of their way to like
[2324.66 --> 2326.70]  disable the feature and
[2326.70 --> 2327.68]  all the card was doing
[2327.68 --> 2328.58]  was processing physics.
[2328.78 --> 2330.08]  So was it really doing
[2330.08 --> 2331.04]  any work with the other
[2331.04 --> 2331.42]  GPU?
[2331.72 --> 2332.66]  It doesn't sound like it
[2332.66 --> 2332.86]  was.
[2332.90 --> 2333.36]  It sounds like it was
[2333.36 --> 2333.88]  just sitting there and
[2333.88 --> 2334.74]  independently doing its
[2334.74 --> 2335.02]  thing.
[2335.64 --> 2336.84]  Yeah, I just jumped to
[2336.84 --> 2337.82]  the Twitch chat and I
[2337.82 --> 2338.64]  see some guy saying
[2338.64 --> 2339.86]  AMD sucks with a
[2339.86 --> 2340.78]  billion exclamation
[2340.78 --> 2341.68]  marks and then someone
[2341.68 --> 2342.96]  else saying NVIDIA is
[2342.96 --> 2344.26]  for hipsters.
[2344.70 --> 2346.24]  So good job, fanboys.
[2346.82 --> 2347.50]  What an argument.
[2348.36 --> 2349.18]  Fanboys, you are
[2349.18 --> 2350.14]  holding up the internet.
[2350.30 --> 2351.16]  You are single-handedly
[2351.16 --> 2351.90]  holding up the internet
[2351.90 --> 2352.84]  because without your
[2352.84 --> 2354.04]  rewards, without your
[2354.04 --> 2355.06]  wars, we'd have far too
[2355.06 --> 2355.76]  much bandwidth to get
[2355.76 --> 2356.38]  into other trouble.
[2356.78 --> 2357.56]  You're the only reason
[2357.56 --> 2358.66]  why your company is able
[2358.66 --> 2359.20]  to exist.
[2359.30 --> 2360.22]  So good job, fanboys.
[2361.82 --> 2362.78]  Apparently from here on
[2362.78 --> 2363.96]  out, any NVIDIA GPU that
[2363.96 --> 2364.86]  runs PhysX will have to
[2364.86 --> 2366.64]  be a GeForce 8 series or
[2366.64 --> 2367.56]  later with a minimum of
[2367.56 --> 2369.10]  256 megabytes of memory.
[2369.40 --> 2370.74]  So that's not exactly a
[2370.74 --> 2371.50]  huge requirement.
[2371.78 --> 2372.58]  No really big deal
[2372.58 --> 2372.88]  there.
[2374.48 --> 2377.30]  And yeah, I don't know
[2377.30 --> 2378.46]  because that's when
[2378.46 --> 2379.64]  NVIDIA introduced the
[2379.64 --> 2381.82]  introduced CUDA.
[2381.82 --> 2383.82]  That got fairly
[2383.82 --> 2385.36]  uninteresting because there's
[2385.36 --> 2386.16]  not a lot of information
[2386.16 --> 2386.88]  other than they're just
[2386.88 --> 2387.60]  going to make it stop
[2387.60 --> 2387.94]  working.
[2388.20 --> 2389.38]  And that's why I believe
[2389.38 --> 2390.52]  that it's not, if it was a
[2390.52 --> 2391.48]  technical hurdle and they
[2391.48 --> 2392.38]  were like, we're rewriting
[2392.38 --> 2393.88]  the whole stack for PhysX to
[2393.88 --> 2395.18]  favor new features on later
[2395.18 --> 2396.32]  generation processors or
[2396.32 --> 2396.94]  something, that would make
[2396.94 --> 2397.26]  sense.
[2397.66 --> 2397.80]  Yeah.
[2397.82 --> 2398.42]  But if they're just like,
[2398.46 --> 2399.84]  yeah, we're turning it off.
[2400.26 --> 2401.34]  That's more of like, we're
[2401.34 --> 2401.68]  sad.
[2401.94 --> 2403.08]  We're sad that people out
[2403.08 --> 2403.86]  there are like trying to use
[2403.86 --> 2405.02]  ATI and NVIDIA and it's
[2405.02 --> 2406.16]  like ruining our whole fanboy
[2406.16 --> 2406.60]  campaign.
[2407.22 --> 2407.48]  Yeah.
[2407.88 --> 2409.04]  Apparently they are working
[2409.04 --> 2410.78]  on a resolution for PhysX
[2410.78 --> 2412.66]  issues with AMD APUs.
[2413.12 --> 2414.34]  So we'll see what happens
[2414.34 --> 2414.62]  there.
[2414.62 --> 2415.94]  So the APU will be a
[2415.94 --> 2416.56]  supported scenario?
[2417.16 --> 2419.02]  I think maybe that's like an
[2419.02 --> 2419.72]  eventuality.
[2419.88 --> 2420.46]  I think it might be a
[2420.46 --> 2421.90]  problem right now, but they
[2421.90 --> 2422.92]  do say they are working
[2422.92 --> 2423.30]  with it.
[2423.36 --> 2424.22]  So hopefully that happens.
[2424.70 --> 2425.38]  And then here's your
[2425.38 --> 2427.62]  Half-Life 3 rumors thing,
[2428.40 --> 2429.28]  which we'll do before we
[2429.28 --> 2429.86]  jump into.
[2430.66 --> 2431.58]  Have you seen all the
[2431.58 --> 2432.34]  tweets I've been sending
[2432.34 --> 2433.40]  out for like the last three
[2433.40 --> 2433.74]  weeks?
[2433.94 --> 2435.38]  All the Half-Life 3 stuff
[2435.38 --> 2436.26]  photoshopping?
[2436.92 --> 2437.62]  So we're going to give you
[2437.62 --> 2438.84]  some more fodder for that
[2438.84 --> 2439.22]  fire.
[2439.76 --> 2440.04]  Yes.
[2440.82 --> 2442.04]  Give me one quick second.
[2442.24 --> 2442.52]  All right.
[2442.56 --> 2444.14]  If I jump over here, source
[2444.14 --> 2446.36]  two found in files.
[2446.82 --> 2448.02]  I have a picture here,
[2448.02 --> 2449.14]  which you guys totally
[2449.14 --> 2449.94]  aren't going to be able to
[2449.94 --> 2451.28]  see at all because screen
[2451.28 --> 2453.18]  sharing is not working at
[2453.18 --> 2453.62]  all.
[2454.82 --> 2456.48]  It's a square, dark gray
[2456.48 --> 2457.76]  window with some white text
[2457.76 --> 2458.02]  in it.
[2458.10 --> 2458.72]  I'm just trying to help.
[2459.64 --> 2460.30]  Good work.
[2460.40 --> 2460.78]  Good work.
[2460.86 --> 2461.52]  I appreciate it.
[2461.66 --> 2462.26]  I'm not going to have time
[2462.26 --> 2463.72]  to open up the dock, but
[2463.72 --> 2465.36]  essentially it's a picture
[2465.36 --> 2468.28]  of the directory set up
[2468.28 --> 2469.84]  for, oh, can I get a link
[2469.84 --> 2470.34]  from this?
[2470.88 --> 2471.88]  Is that possible?
[2472.98 --> 2473.38]  No.
[2473.76 --> 2474.64]  Give me a quick second.
[2474.84 --> 2475.48]  Do, do, do, do, do.
[2476.02 --> 2477.18]  I will post something in
[2477.18 --> 2477.60]  the chat.
[2478.06 --> 2478.76]  So I'm going to post the
[2478.76 --> 2479.88]  original thread, which is
[2479.88 --> 2481.66]  by lots of unexplainable
[2481.66 --> 2483.74]  lag, which is a fantastic
[2483.74 --> 2485.64]  name, I have to say.
[2486.32 --> 2486.98]  Do, do, do, do.
[2487.12 --> 2487.38]  Okay.
[2487.46 --> 2488.48]  So I just spammed that in
[2488.48 --> 2488.84]  the chat.
[2488.90 --> 2489.56]  If you're watching the
[2489.56 --> 2490.70]  VOD of this, you'll be
[2490.70 --> 2491.34]  able to see it in the
[2491.34 --> 2493.06]  description down below,
[2493.06 --> 2494.56]  hopefully, or you'll be
[2494.56 --> 2495.90]  able to jump to the dock
[2495.90 --> 2497.24]  on the forum, which
[2497.24 --> 2497.98]  you'll, well, you'll be
[2497.98 --> 2498.82]  able to see the dock in
[2498.82 --> 2499.64]  the description down
[2499.64 --> 2500.40]  below, and then you'll
[2500.40 --> 2501.04]  be able to go to the
[2501.04 --> 2502.50]  dock, which will show you
[2502.50 --> 2503.42]  the link, which is on the
[2503.42 --> 2503.66]  forum.
[2503.92 --> 2504.42]  There we go.
[2504.68 --> 2505.50]  That was a whole bunch
[2505.50 --> 2505.88]  of jumps.
[2506.20 --> 2507.32]  But essentially, someone
[2507.32 --> 2508.76]  found it in a Source 2
[2508.76 --> 2510.24]  directory, because that's
[2510.24 --> 2511.14]  the most hidden way they
[2511.14 --> 2511.94]  could have possibly done
[2511.94 --> 2514.30]  it, which came with a big
[2514.30 --> 2515.90]  update for Dota 2's SDK,
[2516.14 --> 2516.96]  which is called Hammer.
[2517.84 --> 2518.84]  Many are speculating that
[2518.84 --> 2520.84]  it's actually Source 2 as a
[2520.84 --> 2522.16]  soft launch instead of a
[2522.16 --> 2524.02]  hard launch, and Valve has
[2524.02 --> 2524.82]  stated that this is a
[2524.82 --> 2526.14]  developer-focused release
[2526.14 --> 2528.04]  and currently has high
[2528.04 --> 2529.02]  system requirements.
[2529.30 --> 2531.84]  So not denying it, which
[2531.84 --> 2533.44]  is fantastic, because that
[2533.44 --> 2534.58]  does sound like it could be
[2534.58 --> 2535.84]  a soft launch, just so
[2535.84 --> 2536.90]  people can tinker with it
[2536.90 --> 2537.82]  before they actually hard
[2537.82 --> 2538.72]  launch it later on.
[2539.48 --> 2541.72]  All the files would share a
[2541.72 --> 2542.66]  name with Source Engine,
[2542.90 --> 2544.32]  and they also are qualified
[2544.32 --> 2545.12]  with the number 2.
[2545.52 --> 2548.18]  So as you guys can see in
[2548.18 --> 2548.84]  there, maybe...
[2549.42 --> 2550.22]  Well, let's be honest,
[2550.22 --> 2551.38]  you do have to check to
[2551.38 --> 2552.66]  include hidden objects to
[2552.66 --> 2554.36]  see it, so, you know...
[2554.36 --> 2554.96]  Whoa!
[2555.20 --> 2556.54]  So not everybody's going to
[2556.54 --> 2557.42]  be able to just find this.
[2557.48 --> 2558.16]  I mean, only the true
[2558.16 --> 2558.90]  hacks are...
[2558.90 --> 2560.86]  I run that by default.
[2561.74 --> 2563.74]  So, I guess I'm pretty
[2563.74 --> 2564.34]  badass.
[2564.70 --> 2565.42]  I don't know, not really.
[2567.34 --> 2569.24]  Yeah, it's...
[2569.24 --> 2570.14]  Gabe Newell said,
[2570.26 --> 2571.30]  we've been working...
[2571.30 --> 2572.48]  we've been waiting for a
[2572.48 --> 2574.34]  game to roll it, Source 2,
[2574.58 --> 2576.12]  out with, and he also said
[2576.12 --> 2577.50]  that it's a new engine
[2577.50 --> 2578.52]  altogether, not a mere
[2578.52 --> 2579.62]  extension of the existing
[2579.62 --> 2580.42]  Source technology.
[2580.82 --> 2582.00]  So that's probably why
[2582.00 --> 2583.22]  you're seeing that folder.
[2583.36 --> 2584.38]  They've updated Hammer
[2584.38 --> 2587.36]  with this possibly Source 2
[2587.36 --> 2588.78]  stuff so that they can
[2588.78 --> 2589.80]  roll it out later on.
[2590.00 --> 2590.80]  I think this is pretty
[2590.80 --> 2593.00]  interesting because that
[2593.00 --> 2593.94]  means we have another
[2593.94 --> 2595.52]  thing that's on the 2
[2595.52 --> 2596.36]  nomenclature.
[2598.54 --> 2600.24]  We will eventually get a
[2600.24 --> 2601.32]  title that is 3, and it
[2601.32 --> 2602.02]  will be Half-Life.
[2602.28 --> 2603.14]  I just don't know when.
[2603.14 --> 2603.86]  But the most brilliant
[2603.86 --> 2604.58]  thing would be is if
[2604.58 --> 2605.78]  Half-Life 3 ran on the
[2605.78 --> 2606.62]  Source 2 engine.
[2606.62 --> 2609.96]  That would be awesome.
[2611.04 --> 2611.76]  They're just like, no,
[2611.92 --> 2612.88]  we will not release a
[2612.88 --> 2613.70]  series of 3s.
[2614.14 --> 2615.42]  What I'm kind of hoping
[2615.42 --> 2617.04]  is that this is, again,
[2617.30 --> 2618.18]  something that's happening
[2618.18 --> 2619.64]  pre-Gamescom and PAX
[2619.64 --> 2619.90]  Prime.
[2620.68 --> 2622.38]  So hopefully they go,
[2622.46 --> 2623.82]  hey, yeah, Source 2
[2623.82 --> 2624.90]  at Gamescom and PAX
[2624.90 --> 2626.16]  Prime, even though this
[2626.16 --> 2627.14]  definitely isn't, like,
[2627.16 --> 2628.56]  a very official announcement
[2628.56 --> 2629.12]  as someone just
[2629.12 --> 2629.98]  randomly found it.
[2630.22 --> 2631.38]  And this I would believe
[2631.38 --> 2632.80]  even more than the
[2632.80 --> 2633.92]  Microsoft Halo thing,
[2633.96 --> 2634.74]  which I'm just choosing
[2634.74 --> 2635.84]  to believe because
[2635.84 --> 2637.26]  they're not denying it.
[2637.94 --> 2638.86]  They're saying it's
[2638.86 --> 2639.48]  new stuff.
[2639.68 --> 2640.38]  They're just saying it's
[2640.38 --> 2641.22]  for developers and it
[2641.22 --> 2641.76]  has high system
[2641.76 --> 2642.66]  requirements currently.
[2643.06 --> 2643.90]  So maybe it needs more
[2643.90 --> 2644.52]  optimizations.
[2644.76 --> 2645.64]  Maybe it needs to be
[2645.64 --> 2646.74]  tinkered with some more.
[2648.34 --> 2649.14]  But it's...
[2649.14 --> 2650.42]  Well, from a software
[2650.42 --> 2651.38]  developer perspective,
[2651.58 --> 2652.54]  too, chances are if the
[2652.54 --> 2654.40]  engine's in an earlier
[2654.40 --> 2655.26]  stage like this, it's
[2655.26 --> 2656.58]  probably debug code.
[2656.70 --> 2657.90]  So it's probably heavily,
[2657.94 --> 2660.18]  heavily filled with lots
[2660.18 --> 2660.98]  of additional code that
[2660.98 --> 2661.80]  just gets cut out for the
[2661.80 --> 2662.28]  final product.
[2662.52 --> 2663.32]  But they need that code to
[2663.32 --> 2664.32]  find all the bugs early on.
[2664.32 --> 2665.12]  That makes sense.
[2665.24 --> 2666.04]  And that's probably it.
[2666.56 --> 2668.50]  So it's probably going to
[2668.50 --> 2669.20]  be much more streamlined
[2669.20 --> 2670.20]  later on, which is great.
[2670.32 --> 2671.52]  So this is interesting and
[2671.52 --> 2673.06]  cool because every single
[2673.06 --> 2673.66]  time that there's a
[2673.66 --> 2675.52]  Source update, so many
[2675.52 --> 2677.24]  games just get better.
[2677.76 --> 2678.46]  It used to be the
[2678.46 --> 2679.08]  Unreal Engine.
[2679.20 --> 2680.44]  It still kind of is, but
[2680.44 --> 2682.36]  definitely Source at this
[2682.36 --> 2683.40]  point in time will ramp up
[2683.40 --> 2684.70]  a whole bunch of stuff.
[2685.80 --> 2686.52]  Now we're going to
[2686.52 --> 2687.78]  actually jump to sponsors
[2687.78 --> 2689.24]  real quick, which I'm
[2689.24 --> 2689.90]  terrible at doing
[2689.90 --> 2690.62]  sponsor spots.
[2690.96 --> 2692.28]  But apparently when we
[2692.28 --> 2693.40]  have horrible sponsor
[2693.40 --> 2695.24]  spots, it's fine.
[2695.62 --> 2696.72]  So let me see if I can
[2696.72 --> 2697.06]  do this.
[2697.30 --> 2697.76]  I think I'm going to
[2697.76 --> 2699.10]  have to re-grab you
[2699.10 --> 2700.58]  because I don't think
[2700.58 --> 2701.20]  you're going to be here.
[2701.50 --> 2701.80]  Nope.
[2702.28 --> 2702.64]  Crap.
[2703.08 --> 2703.50]  All right.
[2703.58 --> 2704.12]  Give me a second.
[2704.80 --> 2705.60]  We're going to grab you
[2705.60 --> 2705.92]  again.
[2706.74 --> 2708.28]  Not in that way.
[2708.42 --> 2709.02]  Settle down.
[2709.88 --> 2710.64]  I was just getting
[2710.64 --> 2711.30]  excited too.
[2711.40 --> 2711.62]  No.
[2712.12 --> 2712.24]  No.
[2712.40 --> 2712.76]  Aw.
[2713.26 --> 2713.56]  Okay.
[2713.64 --> 2714.28]  So you're a little bit
[2714.28 --> 2715.38]  smaller than you should be.
[2715.54 --> 2716.28]  I thought that was like a
[2716.28 --> 2717.26]  Canadian handshake, like
[2717.26 --> 2718.06]  just grabbing people?
[2718.34 --> 2720.32]  Just minor molestation.
[2720.48 --> 2721.40]  That's Canadian handshakes.
[2722.08 --> 2723.90]  So we're starting with
[2723.90 --> 2725.62]  5-4 Club, whose shirt I'm
[2725.62 --> 2726.50]  currently wearing.
[2726.70 --> 2728.04]  This one fits better than
[2728.04 --> 2729.00]  the other one, which some
[2729.00 --> 2729.92]  people have pointed out.
[2730.18 --> 2731.24]  That's just because I have
[2731.24 --> 2732.88]  large pectoral muscles, or
[2732.88 --> 2733.74]  at least I would like to
[2733.74 --> 2734.06]  believe.
[2734.40 --> 2735.84]  So we're doing 5-4
[2735.84 --> 2736.28]  giveaways.
[2736.40 --> 2737.02]  We've been doing this for
[2737.02 --> 2737.66]  quite a while.
[2738.04 --> 2739.72]  You can enter to win in
[2739.72 --> 2740.74]  multiple different ways.
[2740.86 --> 2742.54]  One is by liking an
[2742.54 --> 2744.30]  Instagram picture, which I
[2744.30 --> 2745.54]  will post in the Twitch
[2745.54 --> 2747.30]  chat right now.
[2747.30 --> 2749.54]  I liked an Instagram
[2749.54 --> 2750.28]  picture once.
[2751.00 --> 2751.40]  Once?
[2751.62 --> 2752.38]  Was it exciting?
[2752.90 --> 2753.70]  It was very exciting.
[2754.00 --> 2755.14]  Is that the only one you've
[2755.14 --> 2755.56]  ever liked?
[2755.90 --> 2756.94]  No, I've liked a lot of
[2756.94 --> 2757.06]  them.
[2757.22 --> 2758.16]  I'm sorry I lied to you
[2758.16 --> 2758.26]  now.
[2758.28 --> 2758.74]  I feel bad.
[2758.98 --> 2759.30]  Okay.
[2759.30 --> 2760.36]  So you cheated on that
[2760.36 --> 2761.14]  one Instagram picture?
[2761.22 --> 2761.84]  I did.
[2762.18 --> 2762.68]  Oh, geez.
[2763.16 --> 2763.84]  That's embarrassing.
[2764.24 --> 2765.24]  Anyways, you also have to
[2765.24 --> 2766.32]  follow 5-4.
[2766.42 --> 2767.62]  It's just at 5-4 on
[2767.62 --> 2768.00]  Instagram.
[2768.52 --> 2770.00]  And comment hashtag
[2770.00 --> 2770.92]  Linus Tech Tips.
[2771.86 --> 2773.54]  And just say something
[2773.54 --> 2773.98]  cool.
[2773.98 --> 2776.16]  And we put into a draw,
[2776.28 --> 2776.92]  which we drawed on
[2776.92 --> 2778.72]  one day to win a 5-4
[2778.72 --> 2779.32]  package.
[2779.52 --> 2780.42]  Just so you guys know,
[2780.48 --> 2781.14]  if you want to sign up
[2781.14 --> 2782.64]  for 5-4, it costs 60
[2782.64 --> 2783.38]  bucks a month, but you
[2783.38 --> 2784.94]  get $120 a month worth
[2784.94 --> 2786.52]  of stuff like this
[2786.52 --> 2786.82]  shirt.
[2787.02 --> 2787.92]  You have to go through
[2787.92 --> 2788.80]  like a stylistic
[2788.80 --> 2790.02]  profiling thing where
[2790.02 --> 2790.98]  they profile you, but
[2790.98 --> 2791.84]  not your psychology.
[2792.06 --> 2792.74]  They profile what you
[2792.74 --> 2793.78]  like to wear, which
[2793.78 --> 2794.80]  could be a part of
[2794.80 --> 2795.26]  psychology.
[2795.64 --> 2796.40]  I don't really know.
[2796.96 --> 2797.90]  Someone's calling me.
[2798.02 --> 2798.88]  Let me see who it is.
[2798.88 --> 2800.50]  Hello?
[2801.72 --> 2802.08]  Hi.
[2802.92 --> 2803.78]  This is Luke.
[2804.00 --> 2804.26]  Yep.
[2805.10 --> 2805.36]  Hi.
[2805.42 --> 2805.84]  It doesn't sound like
[2805.84 --> 2806.30]  you for a second.
[2806.66 --> 2807.94]  Just a reminder that
[2807.94 --> 2809.64]  either Saturday or Sunday
[2809.64 --> 2810.72]  is your brother's birthday.
[2810.88 --> 2811.38]  I'm not sure.
[2811.44 --> 2812.40]  Is it the 9th today?
[2812.88 --> 2813.64]  Yeah, I'm hanging out
[2813.64 --> 2814.36]  with Richard on Saturday.
[2814.48 --> 2814.92]  You're on the show,
[2814.98 --> 2815.30]  by the way.
[2816.66 --> 2817.82]  No, I am not.
[2817.98 --> 2818.58]  Yeah, you are.
[2818.76 --> 2819.72]  You totally are.
[2819.98 --> 2821.06]  Well, tell everybody
[2821.06 --> 2821.96]  I say hi.
[2822.52 --> 2823.28]  We can hear you.
[2823.28 --> 2824.48]  They can hear you.
[2824.58 --> 2825.32]  You're on speakerphone.
[2825.32 --> 2827.52]  Hi, Bonnie, please.
[2827.88 --> 2828.32]  Hi.
[2828.94 --> 2830.02]  He says hi.
[2830.88 --> 2831.54]  All right.
[2831.66 --> 2832.26]  I'm going to let you
[2832.26 --> 2832.90]  get back at it.
[2832.98 --> 2833.46]  I'm sorry.
[2833.62 --> 2833.96]  I forgot.
[2834.30 --> 2835.08]  No problem.
[2835.18 --> 2835.64]  Bye, Mom.
[2836.20 --> 2836.60]  Bye.
[2838.54 --> 2839.66]  Calls during the
[2839.66 --> 2840.74]  sponsor spot.
[2840.92 --> 2841.34]  Fantastic.
[2842.00 --> 2842.26]  Awesome.
[2842.60 --> 2842.94]  That was awesome.
[2842.94 --> 2843.76]  5-4 likes partially
[2843.76 --> 2844.90]  screwed up integration,
[2845.12 --> 2845.72]  so whatever.
[2846.24 --> 2847.20]  Maybe your mom wants
[2847.20 --> 2847.80]  You know what?
[2847.82 --> 2849.06]  You probably are not
[2849.06 --> 2849.84]  that great at clothing
[2849.84 --> 2850.16]  yourself.
[2850.42 --> 2851.34]  Sorry if you are.
[2851.44 --> 2852.14]  I'm not, though.
[2852.14 --> 2853.18]  So I could probably
[2853.18 --> 2854.56]  gain from 5-4 Club.
[2854.56 --> 2856.00]  And I know my mom
[2856.00 --> 2856.76]  would probably appreciate
[2856.76 --> 2857.34]  it if I did,
[2857.44 --> 2858.16]  because I still have
[2858.16 --> 2859.22]  I'm wearing shorts
[2859.22 --> 2860.10]  that she literally
[2860.10 --> 2860.70]  bought for me
[2860.70 --> 2861.44]  in grade 8.
[2861.90 --> 2862.44]  Yeah, let's hear you
[2862.44 --> 2862.98]  say that again
[2862.98 --> 2863.72]  after seeing this.
[2864.34 --> 2864.82]  That's actually
[2864.82 --> 2865.52]  kind of fantastic.
[2865.60 --> 2866.12]  Yeah, it is.
[2866.18 --> 2866.90]  I just can't clothe
[2866.90 --> 2867.24]  myself.
[2867.36 --> 2867.92]  Come on, dude.
[2868.10 --> 2868.78]  I can't.
[2868.84 --> 2869.70]  So I just assume
[2869.70 --> 2870.66]  everyone else can.
[2870.76 --> 2871.10]  You know what?
[2871.14 --> 2871.76]  Maybe you can.
[2871.82 --> 2872.26]  I'm sorry.
[2872.54 --> 2873.02]  I haven't bought
[2873.02 --> 2874.00]  months, dude.
[2874.00 --> 2875.24]  Every shirt I get
[2875.24 --> 2875.80]  is just clicking
[2875.80 --> 2876.46]  a button online
[2876.46 --> 2877.26]  and it gets mailed to me.
[2877.76 --> 2878.16]  This is going to
[2878.16 --> 2878.84]  sound terrible,
[2879.00 --> 2879.58]  but every single time
[2879.58 --> 2880.38]  I get a new girlfriend,
[2880.58 --> 2881.94]  I go up in clothing
[2881.94 --> 2883.26]  because I get frustrated
[2883.26 --> 2884.12]  by the clothes.
[2884.12 --> 2885.34]  Where they buy me
[2885.34 --> 2885.80]  new clothes.
[2888.34 --> 2889.02]  Oh, that's
[2889.02 --> 2890.38]  an interesting
[2890.38 --> 2891.46]  girlfriend.
[2892.28 --> 2892.64]  Horrible,
[2892.88 --> 2893.60]  but it's not
[2893.60 --> 2894.28]  actually a good thing.
[2894.38 --> 2895.06]  Okay, moving on.
[2895.16 --> 2895.84]  It takes you about
[2895.84 --> 2896.72]  a minute or less
[2896.72 --> 2897.28]  to actually set up
[2897.28 --> 2897.92]  your style profile.
[2898.04 --> 2898.50]  You essentially
[2898.50 --> 2899.52]  go through and it's
[2899.52 --> 2900.18]  like, what do you like?
[2900.46 --> 2901.24]  What one of these
[2901.24 --> 2901.72]  would you like?
[2901.74 --> 2902.38]  And you pick like
[2902.38 --> 2903.20]  one pair of shoes
[2903.20 --> 2904.14]  or one shirt or whatever
[2904.14 --> 2905.60]  and then it'll tailor
[2905.60 --> 2906.74]  your shipments
[2906.74 --> 2907.50]  to that kind of
[2907.50 --> 2908.76]  style of clothing.
[2909.10 --> 2909.92]  Pretty cool.
[2910.04 --> 2910.74]  If you sign up right now
[2910.74 --> 2911.26]  with offer code
[2911.26 --> 2912.08]  Linus, you get $15
[2912.08 --> 2913.86]  off your first month
[2913.86 --> 2914.60]  and they have
[2914.60 --> 2915.48]  a friend referral program
[2915.48 --> 2916.66]  where if you refer someone
[2916.66 --> 2917.26]  you get $15
[2917.26 --> 2919.18]  off of your next month's
[2919.18 --> 2920.84]  membership as well.
[2921.46 --> 2922.64]  Then next up
[2922.64 --> 2923.74]  we have,
[2923.84 --> 2924.28]  I'm going to have to
[2924.28 --> 2924.92]  fix it again
[2924.92 --> 2925.46]  because it's going to be
[2925.46 --> 2925.96]  broken again.
[2926.08 --> 2926.56]  I'm going to give that
[2926.56 --> 2927.50]  service a try actually.
[2927.58 --> 2928.06]  I like that
[2928.06 --> 2929.38]  because every other
[2929.38 --> 2930.34]  subscription service
[2930.34 --> 2930.88]  I've done,
[2931.04 --> 2931.72]  you already know
[2931.72 --> 2932.10]  what's coming.
[2932.20 --> 2932.66]  I'd like to just
[2932.66 --> 2933.30]  get surprised.
[2934.08 --> 2934.88]  Yeah, I think the
[2934.88 --> 2936.76]  whole idea of 5-4 Club
[2936.76 --> 2938.20]  is that you can be
[2938.20 --> 2939.18]  the biggest,
[2939.54 --> 2940.46]  laziest person
[2940.46 --> 2941.12]  ever
[2941.12 --> 2942.02]  and they'll just
[2942.02 --> 2942.68]  take care of
[2942.68 --> 2943.24]  everything,
[2943.48 --> 2944.12]  which is fantastic
[2944.12 --> 2945.04]  because you know
[2945.04 --> 2945.16]  what?
[2945.22 --> 2946.10]  I actually don't mind
[2946.10 --> 2946.84]  going shopping with
[2946.84 --> 2947.84]  people for them
[2947.84 --> 2948.62]  but I don't like
[2948.62 --> 2949.54]  shopping for myself.
[2949.96 --> 2950.66]  I'm the same way.
[2951.00 --> 2951.78]  I can help people
[2951.78 --> 2952.68]  pick things out
[2952.68 --> 2953.58]  but if I'm shopping
[2953.58 --> 2954.02]  for myself,
[2954.10 --> 2954.42]  I'm just going to be
[2954.42 --> 2954.56]  like,
[2954.64 --> 2955.48]  I'm bored.
[2955.72 --> 2956.06]  I don't want to do
[2956.06 --> 2956.24]  this.
[2956.32 --> 2956.82]  I went and bought
[2956.82 --> 2958.30]  two pairs of
[2958.30 --> 2958.90]  tailored jeans
[2958.90 --> 2959.90]  once in my entire
[2959.90 --> 2961.16]  life and it was
[2961.16 --> 2961.90]  like the most horrible
[2961.90 --> 2962.78]  experience ever.
[2962.96 --> 2963.18]  It's like,
[2963.24 --> 2964.20]  some people like that.
[2964.26 --> 2964.40]  It's like,
[2964.42 --> 2964.66]  oh, here,
[2964.72 --> 2965.36]  have some water.
[2965.48 --> 2965.78]  We're going to
[2965.78 --> 2966.74]  tailor your jeans.
[2967.00 --> 2968.06]  I can't stand it.
[2968.14 --> 2968.50]  It's like,
[2968.50 --> 2969.10]  I just want to go
[2969.10 --> 2969.68]  buy them and cuff
[2969.68 --> 2970.16]  them up and say,
[2970.22 --> 2970.56]  screw it.
[2972.62 --> 2973.34]  Exactly, yeah.
[2974.06 --> 2974.36]  All right,
[2974.44 --> 2975.10]  so jumping up to
[2975.10 --> 2975.78]  lynda.com.
[2975.86 --> 2976.42]  Quite a few people
[2976.42 --> 2977.08]  in the office use
[2977.08 --> 2977.28]  this.
[2977.38 --> 2978.00]  I've used it in the
[2978.00 --> 2978.94]  past and I currently
[2978.94 --> 2979.34]  use it.
[2979.64 --> 2980.18]  My mom,
[2980.34 --> 2981.04]  speaking of which,
[2981.30 --> 2982.34]  has used it to try
[2982.34 --> 2983.10]  and learn Excel.
[2984.52 --> 2984.84]  Taryn,
[2984.96 --> 2985.56]  one of our editors,
[2985.70 --> 2986.26]  has gained a whole
[2986.26 --> 2986.74]  bunch of editing
[2986.74 --> 2987.52]  skills by learning
[2987.52 --> 2989.20]  them on lynda.com.
[2989.28 --> 2989.98]  You can learn tons
[2989.98 --> 2990.90]  of stuff and one
[2990.90 --> 2991.32]  thing that I
[2991.32 --> 2992.10]  actually suggested
[2992.10 --> 2992.34]  for,
[2992.42 --> 2992.92]  which is interesting
[2992.92 --> 2993.54]  because Jerry's
[2993.54 --> 2993.96]  on the stream,
[2994.20 --> 2995.36]  is learning programming.
[2995.36 --> 2996.58]  I've talked to
[2996.58 --> 2997.40]  tons of people
[2997.40 --> 2998.28]  that want to get
[2998.28 --> 2998.80]  into programming
[2998.80 --> 2999.48]  that are in high
[2999.48 --> 3000.30]  school that are
[3000.30 --> 3000.52]  like,
[3000.68 --> 3000.94]  yeah,
[3001.32 --> 3002.06]  my course is
[3002.06 --> 3002.66]  really boring.
[3003.02 --> 3004.16]  Is it a video-based
[3004.16 --> 3004.72]  service too?
[3005.30 --> 3005.88]  Like video learning?
[3006.42 --> 3007.70]  Because that's like,
[3007.82 --> 3008.18]  honestly,
[3008.44 --> 3009.36]  most of all the
[3009.36 --> 3010.10]  coding knowledge
[3010.10 --> 3010.76]  that I have
[3010.76 --> 3011.58]  is from taking
[3011.58 --> 3012.42]  video,
[3012.54 --> 3013.54]  like current coding
[3013.54 --> 3014.14]  knowledge is from
[3014.14 --> 3014.78]  video courses
[3014.78 --> 3015.72]  that I've taken
[3015.72 --> 3016.12]  over the course
[3016.12 --> 3016.66]  of many years
[3016.66 --> 3017.60]  because you can
[3017.60 --> 3018.12]  slow them down,
[3018.20 --> 3018.74]  you can speed them
[3018.74 --> 3018.94]  up,
[3018.98 --> 3019.50]  you can play them
[3019.50 --> 3019.82]  back,
[3019.86 --> 3020.16]  you can keep
[3020.16 --> 3020.58]  going back.
[3020.68 --> 3020.76]  I mean,
[3020.82 --> 3021.54]  it's honestly
[3021.54 --> 3021.98]  the best way
[3021.98 --> 3022.30]  to learn.
[3023.10 --> 3024.22]  It's great.
[3024.34 --> 3025.12]  I love lynda.com.
[3025.12 --> 3025.46]  I've,
[3025.88 --> 3026.66]  and like the reason
[3026.66 --> 3027.28]  why I suggest it
[3027.28 --> 3028.66]  to people in high
[3028.66 --> 3029.50]  school still is
[3029.50 --> 3030.04]  because tons of
[3030.04 --> 3030.42]  people aren't
[3030.42 --> 3031.06]  challenged by the
[3031.06 --> 3031.80]  high school programs
[3031.80 --> 3032.24]  and you can go
[3032.24 --> 3033.42]  on lynda.com and
[3033.42 --> 3034.48]  learn freaking
[3034.48 --> 3035.26]  anything.
[3035.54 --> 3036.14]  Like I've said,
[3036.24 --> 3036.94]  they have thousands
[3036.94 --> 3037.58]  of courses and
[3037.58 --> 3038.02]  they're adding new
[3038.02 --> 3038.52]  ones every single
[3038.52 --> 3040.10]  week and programming
[3040.10 --> 3040.64]  is one of their
[3040.64 --> 3041.48]  main sections.
[3041.74 --> 3042.06]  So if you want to
[3042.06 --> 3042.54]  learn stuff about
[3042.54 --> 3042.90]  programming,
[3043.06 --> 3043.62]  really good place
[3043.62 --> 3044.04]  to go.
[3044.50 --> 3044.86]  Just watch
[3044.86 --> 3046.14]  Codegasm first
[3046.14 --> 3046.42]  though.
[3046.72 --> 3047.22]  They got to watch
[3047.22 --> 3048.06]  Codegasm and then
[3048.06 --> 3048.36]  go.
[3048.44 --> 3049.16]  Share the love.
[3049.36 --> 3050.28]  Go to Codegasm for
[3050.28 --> 3051.02]  some of your stuff.
[3051.18 --> 3052.00]  Go to lynda.com for
[3052.00 --> 3052.68]  other parts of your
[3052.68 --> 3052.88]  stuff.
[3052.96 --> 3053.54]  You probably need a
[3053.54 --> 3053.88]  whole bunch of
[3053.88 --> 3054.30]  stuff to learn
[3054.30 --> 3054.70]  anyways.
[3055.82 --> 3056.98]  If you jump on
[3056.98 --> 3057.82]  and go to lynda.com
[3057.82 --> 3058.70]  slash WAN show,
[3058.82 --> 3059.26]  you get a seven
[3059.26 --> 3060.16]  day free trial.
[3061.74 --> 3062.76]  And yeah,
[3063.02 --> 3063.52]  plans start at about
[3063.52 --> 3064.40]  25 bucks a month,
[3064.46 --> 3065.30]  but you get tons of
[3065.30 --> 3066.10]  stuff to learn and
[3066.10 --> 3066.40]  it's going to be
[3066.40 --> 3066.82]  something that's
[3066.82 --> 3067.62]  going to be easy to
[3067.62 --> 3068.52]  get like your mom
[3068.52 --> 3069.00]  to get behind.
[3069.08 --> 3069.30]  Be like,
[3069.36 --> 3069.58]  mom,
[3069.62 --> 3070.28]  I'm not learning
[3070.28 --> 3070.94]  enough at school.
[3071.02 --> 3071.56]  I want to learn
[3071.56 --> 3072.06]  more.
[3072.60 --> 3072.76]  Well,
[3072.80 --> 3073.52]  like a single good
[3073.52 --> 3074.44]  programming book is
[3074.44 --> 3074.72]  like,
[3074.80 --> 3075.88]  it can be 60 bucks.
[3076.34 --> 3077.42]  So that's,
[3077.50 --> 3078.68]  60 bucks is like
[3078.68 --> 3079.62]  pretty cheap.
[3080.50 --> 3080.88]  Well,
[3080.90 --> 3081.02]  no,
[3081.06 --> 3081.56]  I'm not talking about
[3081.56 --> 3082.32]  like textbooks from
[3082.32 --> 3082.68]  college.
[3082.68 --> 3083.38]  I'm talking about like
[3083.38 --> 3083.98]  if you want to go
[3083.98 --> 3084.78]  buy like the C sharp
[3084.78 --> 3085.50]  Bible or something
[3085.50 --> 3085.78]  like that,
[3085.82 --> 3086.48]  one of the larger
[3086.48 --> 3087.28]  reference material
[3087.28 --> 3088.60]  books or like C sharp
[3088.60 --> 3089.20]  for dummies and
[3089.20 --> 3089.36]  stuff,
[3089.38 --> 3090.34]  you can pay 30 to 60
[3090.34 --> 3091.00]  bucks for a single
[3091.00 --> 3091.24]  book.
[3091.30 --> 3091.94]  So I'd rather have a
[3091.94 --> 3092.60]  month of unlimited
[3092.60 --> 3093.80]  access to everything.
[3094.34 --> 3094.70]  Yeah.
[3094.78 --> 3095.68]  And I know a ton of
[3095.68 --> 3097.32]  people that don't do
[3097.32 --> 3098.34]  very well with learning
[3098.34 --> 3098.94]  programming out of
[3098.94 --> 3099.68]  books anyways.
[3100.14 --> 3100.76]  If you can get
[3100.76 --> 3101.44]  someone to,
[3101.44 --> 3102.92]  to talk to you or be
[3102.92 --> 3103.84]  much more interactive,
[3104.46 --> 3106.62]  I've seen it go a
[3106.62 --> 3106.94]  lot better.
[3107.40 --> 3108.10]  I agree.
[3109.70 --> 3110.06]  Concurd.
[3110.28 --> 3110.86]  I concur.
[3111.38 --> 3111.82]  Yes.
[3111.82 --> 3113.12]  All right.
[3113.12 --> 3113.66]  We're going to jump
[3113.66 --> 3114.82]  back up in the dock
[3114.82 --> 3116.34]  back to other topics.
[3116.74 --> 3118.14]  So Silverstone has
[3118.14 --> 3119.22]  shown off a power
[3119.22 --> 3119.48]  supply.
[3119.56 --> 3120.04]  I hope this isn't
[3120.04 --> 3121.04]  under NDA because we
[3121.04 --> 3121.72]  have it,
[3122.12 --> 3123.36]  which I'm super stoked
[3123.36 --> 3124.66]  about because it's for
[3124.66 --> 3125.60]  small form factor.
[3125.68 --> 3128.10]  It is an SFX PSU.
[3128.36 --> 3129.22]  So a lot of people
[3129.22 --> 3130.14]  complain that you can't
[3130.14 --> 3131.50]  really do like awesome
[3131.50 --> 3132.40]  overclock builds with
[3132.40 --> 3134.10]  mini ITX systems.
[3134.10 --> 3136.06]  but now you can because
[3136.06 --> 3137.50]  they have a 600 watt 50
[3137.50 --> 3138.68]  amp available on 12
[3138.68 --> 3140.24]  volt rail power supply
[3140.24 --> 3141.30]  which is fully modular
[3141.30 --> 3143.64]  and semi fanless.
[3143.80 --> 3145.68]  I believe it's a 20%
[3145.68 --> 3146.54]  load or below.
[3146.54 --> 3147.88]  It will do a no spin
[3147.88 --> 3148.72]  mode for the fan.
[3149.12 --> 3150.34]  So that mode isn't
[3150.34 --> 3151.56]  super high, but it
[3151.56 --> 3152.16]  exists.
[3152.40 --> 3152.98]  So when you're running
[3152.98 --> 3154.04]  idle or whatever, you
[3154.04 --> 3155.14]  can have a potentially
[3155.14 --> 3157.36]  silent-ish or silent
[3157.36 --> 3158.52]  small form factor build
[3158.52 --> 3159.86]  that does kind of
[3159.86 --> 3160.84]  matter because if you
[3160.84 --> 3161.82]  get some type of fan
[3161.82 --> 3162.76]  controller that can do
[3162.76 --> 3164.00]  thermal load where you
[3164.00 --> 3164.70]  can have all your fans
[3164.70 --> 3166.34]  go off, you can basically
[3166.34 --> 3167.58]  have everything off at
[3167.58 --> 3168.46]  a pretty idle rate as
[3168.46 --> 3169.10]  long as you have fairly
[3169.10 --> 3169.82]  good radiators.
[3170.48 --> 3171.04]  Are a lot of case
[3171.04 --> 3171.92]  manufacturers actually
[3171.92 --> 3172.78]  adopting that form
[3172.78 --> 3173.36]  factor too?
[3173.58 --> 3175.20]  It's slowly becoming a
[3175.20 --> 3175.56]  thing.
[3175.88 --> 3176.34]  Because that's what
[3176.34 --> 3177.32]  pisses me off is I
[3177.32 --> 3178.30]  built so many of these
[3178.30 --> 3179.24]  little systems and
[3179.24 --> 3180.02]  usually when they die
[3180.02 --> 3180.60]  you have to throw the
[3180.60 --> 3181.36]  whole case away and
[3181.36 --> 3182.08]  like go buy another
[3182.08 --> 3183.08]  one because like
[3183.08 --> 3184.10]  every power supply is
[3184.10 --> 3184.56]  proprietary.
[3185.08 --> 3185.62]  Yeah, yeah.
[3186.10 --> 3186.98]  It is becoming a thing
[3186.98 --> 3187.62]  more and more these
[3187.62 --> 3188.88]  days, especially lately
[3188.88 --> 3190.46]  and I bet you with the
[3190.46 --> 3191.06]  announcement of this
[3191.06 --> 3191.68]  power supply there's
[3191.68 --> 3192.26]  going to be even more
[3192.26 --> 3192.86]  because one of the
[3192.86 --> 3193.68]  biggest complaints that
[3193.68 --> 3195.14]  people have had is you
[3195.14 --> 3196.08]  can't really get
[3196.08 --> 3197.18]  appropriate power supplies
[3197.18 --> 3197.82]  for these systems.
[3198.00 --> 3198.66]  So now if you're going
[3198.66 --> 3200.48]  for like crazy overclocked
[3200.48 --> 3201.40]  balls to the wall system
[3201.40 --> 3202.30]  which a lot of people
[3202.30 --> 3203.40]  still want to do with
[3203.40 --> 3204.68]  mini ITX, you'll actually
[3204.68 --> 3205.48]  be able to do it because
[3205.48 --> 3206.66]  600 watts is quite a bit
[3206.66 --> 3207.32]  to play with to be
[3207.32 --> 3207.64]  completely honest.
[3207.64 --> 3208.54]  For a small system
[3208.54 --> 3210.00]  definitely and I want to
[3210.00 --> 3211.04]  build media centers and I
[3211.04 --> 3212.00]  want to build small media
[3212.00 --> 3212.86]  centers and that's been my
[3212.86 --> 3214.06]  only hold back so far.
[3214.46 --> 3215.10]  Yeah, exactly.
[3215.10 --> 3215.80]  I don't want to buy these
[3215.80 --> 3216.50]  cases that have these
[3216.50 --> 3217.24]  proprietary supplies.
[3217.34 --> 3217.92]  So that's really cool.
[3218.22 --> 3219.08]  Actually a video that I'm
[3219.08 --> 3220.12]  planning on working on
[3220.12 --> 3222.16]  while Linus is away is
[3222.16 --> 3223.08]  I'm going to be comparing
[3223.08 --> 3225.56]  mass wattage versus low
[3225.56 --> 3225.94]  wattage.
[3226.12 --> 3227.22]  So I'm going to be taking
[3227.22 --> 3228.84]  two very good power
[3228.84 --> 3230.10]  supplies but comparing a
[3230.10 --> 3231.32]  very good but low
[3231.32 --> 3233.10]  lower wattage power
[3233.10 --> 3234.28]  supply versus a very good
[3234.28 --> 3235.28]  very high wattage power
[3235.28 --> 3236.68]  supply just to prove that
[3236.68 --> 3238.82]  having a 1200 watt power
[3238.82 --> 3240.32]  supply versus a 600 watt
[3240.32 --> 3241.32]  power supply with a fairly
[3241.32 --> 3242.42]  fairly standard system
[3242.42 --> 3243.22]  isn't actually going to
[3243.22 --> 3243.68]  help you.
[3244.16 --> 3245.76]  But what I'm not trying to
[3245.76 --> 3247.44]  prove because it's you
[3247.44 --> 3248.34]  don't want to do that is
[3248.34 --> 3249.26]  having a really crappy
[3249.26 --> 3250.74]  power supply in a really
[3250.74 --> 3251.82]  heavily overclocked system
[3251.82 --> 3253.10]  you want a reliable one
[3253.10 --> 3253.94]  you just don't necessarily
[3253.94 --> 3256.48]  need 1500 watt whatever
[3256.48 --> 3257.94]  the crap because you
[3257.94 --> 3258.84]  probably don't have that
[3258.84 --> 3259.68]  much stuff in your system.
[3260.06 --> 3260.26]  You might.
[3260.52 --> 3262.16]  I've got 1300 watts of
[3262.16 --> 3263.08]  power in my system.
[3263.30 --> 3263.90]  I was going to say you
[3263.90 --> 3264.14]  might.
[3264.56 --> 3265.20]  There's definitely going to
[3265.20 --> 3265.84]  be people out there.
[3265.86 --> 3266.24]  It's saying it was
[3266.24 --> 3266.78]  using it though.
[3267.52 --> 3267.74]  Yeah.
[3268.04 --> 3268.18]  Yeah.
[3269.34 --> 3270.38]  But I don't know.
[3270.58 --> 3272.68]  For a large percentage of
[3272.68 --> 3273.44]  people it won't be that
[3273.44 --> 3273.88]  big of a deal.
[3274.44 --> 3274.62]  Yeah.
[3274.90 --> 3275.50]  And your chances are
[3275.50 --> 3276.20]  you're not going to stuff
[3276.20 --> 3277.62]  stuff a big enough GPU in
[3277.62 --> 3278.70]  that system anyways to need
[3278.70 --> 3279.92]  that that giant power
[3279.92 --> 3280.34]  requirement.
[3280.72 --> 3281.60]  Mm hmm.
[3281.66 --> 3282.10]  All right.
[3282.42 --> 3283.34]  Somebody do that though
[3283.34 --> 3284.44]  just hey if somebody out
[3284.44 --> 3285.50]  there builds a tiny tiny
[3285.50 --> 3286.82]  little system that has
[3286.82 --> 3287.68]  like the little extension
[3287.68 --> 3288.62]  cable that goes to like a
[3288.62 --> 3289.76]  Titan tape to the side of
[3289.76 --> 3289.92]  it.
[3290.44 --> 3291.44]  That'd be awesome to have
[3291.44 --> 3292.78]  like a micro ITX build with
[3292.78 --> 3293.60]  a Titan and the Titans
[3293.60 --> 3295.06]  like an integral part of the
[3295.06 --> 3295.44]  case.
[3295.86 --> 3297.22]  If someone got like little
[3297.22 --> 3299.88]  what do you call it
[3299.88 --> 3301.52]  ventilation hold fiberglass
[3301.52 --> 3302.66]  kind of plate.
[3303.18 --> 3303.34]  Yeah.
[3303.56 --> 3305.06]  Things and just glued them
[3305.06 --> 3306.74]  all to the all four sides
[3306.74 --> 3307.76]  of his case and put four
[3307.76 --> 3308.60]  Titan blacks.
[3308.60 --> 3310.74]  All mini ITX system.
[3310.86 --> 3311.56]  They just fill the whole
[3311.56 --> 3312.56]  thing with mineral oil and
[3312.56 --> 3313.44]  just have it circulated.
[3314.52 --> 3315.10]  Do it.
[3315.18 --> 3315.96]  Somebody needs to do it.
[3316.60 --> 3316.88]  Yeah.
[3317.02 --> 3317.44]  So are there any
[3317.44 --> 3318.22]  millionaires out there
[3318.22 --> 3318.86]  that want to do this?
[3320.36 --> 3320.90]  Yeah really.
[3321.02 --> 3321.58]  Do I still have Titan
[3321.58 --> 3322.26]  blacks behind me?
[3323.12 --> 3324.18]  Can I just be baller on
[3324.18 --> 3324.54]  the show?
[3325.52 --> 3325.80]  Yep.
[3326.16 --> 3326.72]  Wait for it.
[3326.98 --> 3327.50]  Wait for it.
[3327.58 --> 3327.94]  Waiting.
[3329.56 --> 3329.92]  Oh.
[3330.78 --> 3332.04]  Dude I hate you guys.
[3332.46 --> 3332.82]  Seriously?
[3335.28 --> 3335.64]  Oh.
[3335.64 --> 3337.02]  Dude I'm all like poor
[3337.02 --> 3337.54]  people here.
[3337.90 --> 3338.02]  Oh.
[3338.02 --> 3338.78]  I'm just seeing you still.
[3339.12 --> 3340.20]  Frankly he just gets me
[3340.20 --> 3341.82]  see me rub a Titan black
[3341.82 --> 3342.48]  against my face.
[3343.36 --> 3343.76]  Oh.
[3344.04 --> 3345.20]  I'm so excited to install
[3345.20 --> 3345.34]  these.
[3345.34 --> 3346.28]  You've heard about the
[3346.28 --> 3346.98]  room water cooling
[3346.98 --> 3347.62]  project right?
[3347.98 --> 3348.30]  Yes.
[3348.50 --> 3348.72]  Yes.
[3348.78 --> 3349.60]  I actually had some input
[3349.60 --> 3349.88]  on it.
[3349.92 --> 3350.54]  I told you guys you
[3350.54 --> 3352.04]  need to put a Katie
[3352.04 --> 3353.36]  pool on the outside
[3353.36 --> 3354.26]  with an actual spout.
[3354.26 --> 3354.36]  Yeah.
[3354.36 --> 3354.64]  Yeah.
[3354.64 --> 3354.70]  Yeah.
[3354.70 --> 3354.78]  Yeah.
[3355.16 --> 3355.88]  You guys would have
[3355.88 --> 3356.66]  like warm water.
[3356.78 --> 3357.36]  Like you could probably
[3357.36 --> 3358.44]  replace the water heater
[3358.44 --> 3359.18]  in your house with that
[3359.18 --> 3359.36]  thing.
[3359.74 --> 3360.96]  I remember you saying
[3360.96 --> 3361.72]  that actually now.
[3361.72 --> 3364.84]  We've ringed my dad in.
[3364.94 --> 3365.98]  My dad is like a pretty
[3365.98 --> 3366.82]  beast mode plumber.
[3367.62 --> 3368.56]  He was a pretty beast
[3368.56 --> 3369.56]  mode plumber for a while
[3369.56 --> 3370.58]  and then he's started
[3370.58 --> 3371.86]  instructing now at a
[3371.86 --> 3372.28]  university.
[3372.78 --> 3373.62]  So he knows what he's
[3373.62 --> 3374.74]  doing and we're going to
[3374.74 --> 3376.82]  get him to do hard line
[3376.82 --> 3378.32]  piping around most of the
[3378.32 --> 3380.04]  room and he's doing a
[3380.04 --> 3381.56]  return line as well and
[3381.56 --> 3382.66]  he's like he's he's made
[3382.66 --> 3384.04]  our original idea much
[3384.04 --> 3384.72]  more legit.
[3385.66 --> 3386.00]  I'll make it.
[3386.00 --> 3386.48]  He's actually going to be
[3386.48 --> 3387.38]  doing the install for a
[3387.38 --> 3387.98]  lot of that stuff.
[3388.34 --> 3389.30]  I will make you a deal.
[3389.40 --> 3390.08]  You can pass us on the
[3390.08 --> 3390.30]  Linus.
[3390.36 --> 3391.54]  If you guys find a way
[3391.54 --> 3393.20]  to put a shower head on
[3393.20 --> 3393.88]  there in a kiddie pool,
[3394.00 --> 3395.40]  I will drive my ass up
[3395.40 --> 3397.32]  to Canada and I will
[3397.32 --> 3398.20]  take a shower in that
[3398.20 --> 3398.80]  damn kiddie pool.
[3399.04 --> 3399.68]  I will do it.
[3399.86 --> 3400.60]  We're trying to make
[3400.60 --> 3403.04]  sure that it is like
[3403.04 --> 3404.80]  very well contained so
[3404.80 --> 3405.42]  that we won't get any
[3405.42 --> 3406.28]  contaminants in the
[3406.28 --> 3406.92]  loop because that could
[3406.92 --> 3407.70]  be a pretty big issue.
[3408.34 --> 3409.32]  So contaminants.
[3409.42 --> 3411.08]  I don't think you're
[3411.08 --> 3411.86]  showering, man.
[3411.94 --> 3412.38]  The whole thing is
[3412.38 --> 3413.08]  showers.
[3413.46 --> 3415.24]  I don't even go out of
[3415.24 --> 3415.68]  this room.
[3415.96 --> 3416.64]  I live here, dude.
[3417.80 --> 3418.82]  That doesn't mean that
[3418.82 --> 3419.74]  there's no contaminants.
[3419.80 --> 3420.56]  The skin is naturally
[3420.56 --> 3420.92]  oily.
[3420.92 --> 3422.26]  Don't work with me.
[3422.26 --> 3424.72]  I think we're going to
[3424.72 --> 3425.40]  try and do it as legit
[3425.40 --> 3425.92]  as possible.
[3426.06 --> 3426.86]  But yeah, we have a
[3426.86 --> 3427.36]  whole bunch of new
[3427.36 --> 3428.52]  plans now that my dad
[3428.52 --> 3429.60]  has been looped into it.
[3430.08 --> 3430.60]  That's cool.
[3431.42 --> 3432.00]  So you guys are just
[3432.00 --> 3432.46]  going to have quick
[3432.46 --> 3433.02]  disconnects and
[3433.02 --> 3433.42]  everything so you can
[3433.42 --> 3434.12]  just pop the systems
[3434.12 --> 3434.34]  off.
[3434.46 --> 3435.14]  Quick disconnects all
[3435.14 --> 3435.54]  over the place.
[3435.62 --> 3436.34]  It's going to be set up
[3436.34 --> 3438.18]  so that there's an
[3438.18 --> 3438.90]  external radiator on
[3438.90 --> 3440.40]  every system and then
[3440.40 --> 3441.22]  quick disconnects coming
[3441.22 --> 3442.10]  out of the case and
[3442.10 --> 3443.00]  quick disconnects sitting
[3443.00 --> 3443.92]  on the external radiator
[3443.92 --> 3445.60]  on every system so that
[3445.60 --> 3446.02]  if you want to
[3446.02 --> 3446.72]  disconnect it from the
[3446.72 --> 3447.42]  room and take it
[3447.42 --> 3448.76]  somewhere else, you can
[3448.76 --> 3449.92]  quick disconnect off the
[3449.92 --> 3450.76]  room, quick disconnect
[3450.76 --> 3452.34]  up into the radiator and
[3452.34 --> 3453.16]  still be good to go.
[3453.92 --> 3454.42]  You know what you guys
[3454.42 --> 3455.10]  should do is just take a
[3455.10 --> 3456.18]  whole bunch of like four
[3456.18 --> 3457.36]  extra radiators and just
[3457.36 --> 3458.00]  leave them on a shelf.
[3458.08 --> 3458.58]  That way you don't have to
[3458.58 --> 3459.40]  put one on every computer.
[3459.50 --> 3460.20]  You just basically take the
[3460.20 --> 3461.18]  radio over and like snap it
[3461.18 --> 3461.82]  to the side of it.
[3462.14 --> 3462.70]  And then when you're done,
[3462.76 --> 3463.48]  you unplug it and plug it
[3463.48 --> 3463.84]  back in.
[3464.00 --> 3464.92]  That'd be pretty cool too.
[3465.26 --> 3466.20]  That's not a bad idea.
[3466.20 --> 3469.62]  I think we're just going to
[3469.62 --> 3470.32]  leave them strapped in the
[3470.32 --> 3471.48]  system because the idea is
[3471.48 --> 3473.66]  every system will have an
[3473.66 --> 3475.60]  internal reservoir which
[3475.60 --> 3478.30]  shouldn't normally be used.
[3478.42 --> 3478.86]  Maybe it is.
[3478.92 --> 3479.66]  I don't remember exactly how
[3479.66 --> 3479.84]  it works.
[3480.10 --> 3480.98]  Internal reservoir, internal
[3480.98 --> 3482.22]  pump which will be used.
[3482.28 --> 3484.44]  We're going to have D5s in
[3484.44 --> 3485.64]  every computer which we'll be
[3485.64 --> 3487.34]  pushing all the time just to
[3487.34 --> 3489.94]  help the little giant pump
[3489.94 --> 3490.78]  that we have in the other
[3490.78 --> 3491.04]  room.
[3491.20 --> 3492.04]  No, that's a smart move
[3492.04 --> 3492.58]  because you don't want the
[3492.58 --> 3493.66]  first system in the loop like
[3493.66 --> 3494.40]  blowing a hose.
[3494.40 --> 3495.80]  Yeah, exactly.
[3496.42 --> 3496.88]  No, that's cool.
[3497.46 --> 3498.62]  Yeah, so that'll be helping.
[3498.78 --> 3500.12]  So essentially, literally all
[3500.12 --> 3500.64]  that will happen.
[3500.98 --> 3501.72]  You don't even have to take
[3501.72 --> 3502.56]  the side panel off.
[3502.62 --> 3503.80]  You have to do nothing to be
[3503.80 --> 3504.84]  able to remove almost nothing
[3504.84 --> 3505.92]  to be able to take one of the
[3505.92 --> 3506.60]  computers and put it
[3506.60 --> 3507.38]  somewhere else because you
[3507.38 --> 3508.74]  just quick disconnect off,
[3509.00 --> 3510.38]  quick disconnect in, and
[3510.38 --> 3510.82]  that's it.
[3511.00 --> 3512.00]  The quick disconnects are
[3512.00 --> 3512.68]  going to be laying there
[3512.68 --> 3514.44]  waiting all the time.
[3514.44 --> 3515.68]  That is so cool.
[3516.06 --> 3516.96]  I can't wait to see that.
[3516.96 --> 3517.48]  If we take one downstairs to
[3517.48 --> 3518.94]  film or whatever, it'll be
[3518.94 --> 3519.66]  no problem.
[3519.96 --> 3520.54]  So that'll be a really
[3520.54 --> 3521.40]  exciting project.
[3522.22 --> 3523.08]  And like I said, we looped
[3523.08 --> 3524.00]  my dad into that.
[3524.40 --> 3525.62]  And speaking of looping
[3525.62 --> 3527.00]  people into things, I have
[3527.00 --> 3528.24]  some shoutouts for stuff
[3528.24 --> 3529.22]  that's happened on the
[3529.22 --> 3529.60]  forum.
[3530.10 --> 3531.00]  We have a shoutout to the
[3531.00 --> 3533.30]  Boink team for passing a
[3533.30 --> 3535.12]  1 billion point mark, which
[3535.12 --> 3536.20]  is pretty insanity.
[3536.76 --> 3538.56]  And our folding team is now
[3538.56 --> 3540.12]  in 42nd place.
[3541.78 --> 3542.16]  Wow.
[3542.16 --> 3542.86]  Why can't I talk?
[3543.22 --> 3544.82]  And they just passed the 2
[3544.82 --> 3546.24]  billion point mark.
[3546.88 --> 3547.96]  So holy crap.
[3548.22 --> 3549.00]  Good job, everyone.
[3549.16 --> 3549.80]  That's awesome.
[3550.28 --> 3551.88]  Also, a callout for featured
[3551.88 --> 3552.54]  build logs.
[3552.64 --> 3553.12]  I know people have been
[3553.12 --> 3553.88]  asking a lot of questions
[3553.88 --> 3554.44]  about that lady.
[3555.56 --> 3556.60]  I just said lady.
[3556.76 --> 3557.70]  I can't talk right now.
[3557.76 --> 3558.74]  I need liquids, but my
[3558.74 --> 3559.44]  power raid's out.
[3561.64 --> 3562.04]  Anyways.
[3562.04 --> 3562.76]  There you go.
[3562.86 --> 3564.18]  We're having an update for
[3564.18 --> 3564.64]  that.
[3564.86 --> 3565.38]  We now have...
[3565.38 --> 3565.46]  Take the beady.
[3565.54 --> 3566.00]  Thank you.
[3566.06 --> 3566.74]  I appreciate it.
[3566.74 --> 3567.14]  Get the beady.
[3567.14 --> 3571.22]  I now have other people
[3571.22 --> 3572.36]  running it because I was
[3572.36 --> 3573.66]  careless and couldn't keep
[3573.66 --> 3574.12]  up with it.
[3574.22 --> 3577.36]  So now, Wailer and Alpenwasser
[3577.36 --> 3578.36]  and a few other people are
[3578.36 --> 3579.96]  trying to manage it and make
[3579.96 --> 3581.06]  sure that it actually happens.
[3581.30 --> 3583.34]  So we had a proper one last
[3583.34 --> 3584.32]  month, but we're going to
[3584.32 --> 3586.56]  have kind of a catch-up month.
[3586.72 --> 3588.06]  So we're having a feature
[3588.06 --> 3590.06]  build log submission post kind
[3590.06 --> 3592.90]  of open grazing, just submit
[3592.90 --> 3595.08]  all the stuff event where
[3595.08 --> 3596.18]  pretty much anyone can submit
[3596.18 --> 3596.80]  their builds.
[3597.48 --> 3598.40]  Yeah, basically anyone with
[3598.40 --> 3599.46]  completed build can submit.
[3599.58 --> 3600.58]  Just make sure you follow the
[3600.58 --> 3601.34]  posting format.
[3601.92 --> 3603.16]  So check out the build log
[3603.16 --> 3604.50]  section of the forum and
[3604.50 --> 3605.58]  submit your builds there.
[3605.94 --> 3607.20]  And I think when there's
[3607.20 --> 3609.28]  either a timed version or
[3609.28 --> 3610.42]  when we get to 100
[3610.42 --> 3611.96]  submissions, we're going to be
[3611.96 --> 3612.82]  moving it to a voting
[3612.82 --> 3613.16]  thread.
[3613.46 --> 3613.98]  Then we're going to have a
[3613.98 --> 3616.22]  big summary of all the
[3616.22 --> 3617.18]  awesome builds that have
[3617.18 --> 3618.16]  happened in the last little
[3618.16 --> 3618.56]  while.
[3618.94 --> 3619.76]  And then we're going to go
[3619.76 --> 3621.16]  back to a monthly or
[3621.16 --> 3622.72]  quarterly schedule for build
[3622.72 --> 3623.02]  logs.
[3623.36 --> 3624.22]  But it's actually going to be
[3624.22 --> 3625.56]  happening properly now because
[3625.56 --> 3626.50]  now there's a group of us
[3626.50 --> 3628.58]  managing it and not just me
[3628.58 --> 3629.88]  because we all saw how well
[3629.88 --> 3630.52]  that went.
[3631.40 --> 3632.04]  Oh, well.
[3632.18 --> 3634.88]  Now, the most important news
[3634.88 --> 3637.80]  of the day, by far, the most
[3637.80 --> 3639.14]  important news, probably that
[3639.14 --> 3640.50]  you'll hear this quarter or
[3640.50 --> 3642.78]  maybe even possibly this year.
[3643.50 --> 3644.92]  Yoshi's full name has been
[3644.92 --> 3645.36]  revealed.
[3645.68 --> 3646.86]  His name is T Yoshi
[3646.86 --> 3648.22]  Soar Munchakupas.
[3648.22 --> 3652.10]  What does the T stand for?
[3652.36 --> 3653.28]  No one knows!
[3655.74 --> 3657.66]  T Yoshi Soar Munchakupas.
[3658.08 --> 3658.44]  Ridiculous.
[3658.62 --> 3659.56]  I think I'm just going to keep
[3659.56 --> 3660.38]  on calling him Yoshi.
[3660.78 --> 3661.98]  But maybe if I'm trying to be
[3661.98 --> 3663.28]  formal when I'm asking him to
[3663.28 --> 3664.26]  run his cart a little bit
[3664.26 --> 3666.06]  faster in Mario Kart 8, I can
[3666.06 --> 3667.60]  say Yoshi Soar Munchakupas.
[3668.50 --> 3670.20]  Blake Harris unearthed the
[3670.20 --> 3672.84]  character's name from a copy of
[3672.84 --> 3674.70]  the Nintendo Character Guide from
[3674.70 --> 3675.46]  1993.
[3675.46 --> 3677.68]  I bet they were hoping that
[3677.68 --> 3679.26]  that would never be re-Earthed.
[3679.32 --> 3679.72]  Probably.
[3680.02 --> 3681.08]  Because that is not the
[3681.08 --> 3681.80]  greatest name ever.
[3682.70 --> 3684.20]  I think it's actually kind of
[3684.20 --> 3686.14]  cool because Yoshi, which is
[3686.14 --> 3687.44]  way better, but then Soar,
[3687.56 --> 3688.18]  because he kind of looks like
[3688.18 --> 3689.12]  a dinosaur, that makes sense.
[3689.46 --> 3691.68]  And then Munchakupas is probably
[3691.68 --> 3692.86]  the best last name they probably
[3692.86 --> 3693.42]  could have given him.
[3693.68 --> 3694.06]  I agree.
[3694.24 --> 3694.58]  I agree.
[3694.76 --> 3695.70]  It's very accurate, too.
[3695.84 --> 3696.62]  Yeah, exactly.
[3697.82 --> 3699.84]  Mario is also apparently not a
[3699.84 --> 3701.02]  traditional human being.
[3701.54 --> 3702.60]  He has a different species.
[3702.60 --> 3703.46]  He has a different species
[3703.46 --> 3704.60]  called Homo Nintendos.
[3705.46 --> 3707.64]  Nintendonus?
[3708.20 --> 3709.20]  I'm not entirely sure how to
[3709.20 --> 3709.70]  pronounce that.
[3709.94 --> 3710.50]  I think it's Nintendonus.
[3710.50 --> 3711.34]  Donus sounds cooler, though.
[3711.36 --> 3712.36]  Let's go with Nintendonus.
[3712.78 --> 3713.18]  Nintendonus.
[3713.28 --> 3714.82]  Homo Nintendonus.
[3715.92 --> 3718.00]  Mario is Homo Nintendonus.
[3718.38 --> 3720.06]  From here on out, everybody,
[3720.20 --> 3721.30]  when a plumber is at your house,
[3721.40 --> 3723.08]  refer to them as Homo Nintendonus.
[3725.00 --> 3725.90]  I hope that helps.
[3726.04 --> 3727.26]  I'm going to call my dad.
[3727.34 --> 3728.20]  Next time I talk to my dad,
[3728.34 --> 3728.80]  I'll be like,
[3728.88 --> 3730.26]  Father Nintendonus,
[3730.26 --> 3733.08]  can you help us
[3733.08 --> 3734.30]  with our water-cooling project?
[3734.30 --> 3735.44]  They're just like regular humans,
[3735.56 --> 3736.30]  except for their pants
[3736.30 --> 3737.38]  can't go above their ass crack.
[3737.52 --> 3738.50]  That's the difference.
[3738.50 --> 3740.30]  Mario has overall things,
[3740.60 --> 3741.36]  and they stay up just fine.
[3741.36 --> 3742.76]  That's why they wear overalls,
[3742.78 --> 3743.34]  now you know.
[3743.50 --> 3744.44]  Because the butt crack
[3745.00 --> 3746.40]  just keeps going for days.
[3746.50 --> 3747.40]  Because it's Nintendo,
[3747.58 --> 3748.34]  and they had to make sure
[3748.34 --> 3749.10]  that they didn't have
[3749.10 --> 3750.00]  anything scandalous
[3750.00 --> 3750.82]  showing on screen.
[3751.30 --> 3751.94]  That makes sense.
[3752.48 --> 3753.06]  I get it.
[3754.28 --> 3754.64]  Anyways,
[3754.80 --> 3755.72]  that was obviously not
[3755.72 --> 3756.62]  the most important news
[3756.62 --> 3757.00]  of the week,
[3757.00 --> 3757.82]  but I kind of thought
[3757.82 --> 3759.20]  it was awesome.
[3759.62 --> 3761.18]  I know Dorkly right now.
[3761.48 --> 3762.20]  This isn't in the dog at all.
[3762.20 --> 3763.38]  I love Dorkly.
[3763.72 --> 3764.70]  Oh my god.
[3765.02 --> 3765.68]  It's one of my favorite
[3765.68 --> 3766.40]  YouTube channels.
[3767.18 --> 3767.90]  Oh my gosh.
[3768.50 --> 3769.44]  Let me see if I can find
[3769.44 --> 3769.98]  this website.
[3770.46 --> 3770.66]  Yes,
[3770.74 --> 3772.40]  the best Nintendo character ever.
[3773.00 --> 3774.46]  I'll spam this in the chat right now.
[3774.54 --> 3775.48]  They're currently having
[3775.48 --> 3777.26]  a voting contest for this.
[3777.58 --> 3778.18]  And I went through
[3778.18 --> 3778.86]  and did the whole thing.
[3778.90 --> 3779.42]  It's kind of cool
[3779.42 --> 3779.94]  how they do it
[3779.94 --> 3780.68]  because it's fairly,
[3781.24 --> 3781.86]  you get I think
[3781.86 --> 3782.90]  100 matchups,
[3783.00 --> 3784.08]  112 matchups.
[3784.94 --> 3785.92]  And as you go through,
[3786.20 --> 3786.76]  it's kind of like
[3786.76 --> 3787.94]  voting people off,
[3788.04 --> 3788.76]  not necessarily
[3788.76 --> 3789.84]  voting people in
[3789.84 --> 3791.32]  because as you narrow down
[3791.32 --> 3792.98]  your 112 competitions,
[3793.28 --> 3794.02]  you'll start seeing
[3794.02 --> 3795.44]  the same people popping up.
[3795.70 --> 3796.10]  And essentially,
[3796.22 --> 3797.08]  what it's trying to do
[3797.08 --> 3798.70]  is find your favorites.
[3799.12 --> 3800.62]  So say Link is your favorite
[3800.62 --> 3802.16]  because he's currently voted
[3802.16 --> 3803.70]  worldwide favorite right now.
[3803.82 --> 3804.54]  You'll see him
[3804.54 --> 3805.46]  a whole bunch of times
[3805.46 --> 3806.56]  and the final matchup
[3806.56 --> 3807.10]  will be Link
[3807.10 --> 3808.00]  versus someone else.
[3808.32 --> 3808.76]  Seriously,
[3808.86 --> 3809.58]  the Wii Fit trainer?
[3809.96 --> 3810.18]  Yeah,
[3810.24 --> 3810.50]  man.
[3810.62 --> 3811.30]  I voted for her
[3811.30 --> 3811.92]  a couple of times.
[3812.36 --> 3813.46]  I bet you did.
[3813.66 --> 3813.72]  Dude,
[3814.20 --> 3814.72]  you're probably hoping
[3814.72 --> 3815.44]  to get some more quotes.
[3815.44 --> 3816.60]  And Super Smash Bros.
[3816.66 --> 3817.14]  for Wii U.
[3817.46 --> 3818.34]  She's really good.
[3819.24 --> 3820.60]  She's actually really good.
[3820.86 --> 3821.00]  Like,
[3821.04 --> 3821.96]  that's why I voted for her
[3821.96 --> 3822.50]  because I was like,
[3822.54 --> 3822.66]  oh,
[3822.68 --> 3822.84]  whatever,
[3822.90 --> 3823.68]  I'll pick her as a joke
[3823.68 --> 3824.84]  and then I did really well.
[3825.22 --> 3826.26]  I just threw a vote for you,
[3826.32 --> 3826.46]  buddy.
[3826.68 --> 3827.00]  I did.
[3827.28 --> 3827.54]  Thanks,
[3827.62 --> 3827.80]  man.
[3828.16 --> 3828.94]  I appreciate it.
[3829.34 --> 3829.44]  See,
[3829.48 --> 3831.18]  I've got Toad versus Dark Samus.
[3831.26 --> 3832.14]  It's so hard,
[3832.28 --> 3832.90]  some of these votes.
[3833.14 --> 3833.72]  But it's interesting
[3833.72 --> 3834.84]  because you get to see
[3834.84 --> 3836.30]  how everyone stacked up
[3836.30 --> 3837.00]  in your voting
[3837.00 --> 3837.84]  once you're done
[3837.84 --> 3839.32]  and you get to see
[3839.32 --> 3840.62]  how everyone stacks up
[3840.62 --> 3840.94]  overall.
[3840.94 --> 3841.46]  So right now,
[3841.50 --> 3842.66]  the top five are
[3842.66 --> 3844.08]  Link in number one
[3844.08 --> 3845.36]  and then Samus Aran
[3845.36 --> 3846.22]  in number two.
[3846.76 --> 3847.84]  Three is Mario.
[3848.24 --> 3849.26]  Four is Princess Zelda
[3849.26 --> 3851.08]  and then five is Red,
[3851.42 --> 3852.60]  which is like Ash
[3852.60 --> 3854.20]  but in the game series.
[3854.78 --> 3855.48]  So I don't know.
[3855.58 --> 3856.14]  That's pretty cool.
[3856.30 --> 3857.86]  They have 50 different ones.
[3858.18 --> 3859.32]  Last place right now
[3859.32 --> 3860.18]  is Bowser Jr.
[3860.44 --> 3860.78]  Sorry,
[3861.08 --> 3861.32]  buddy.
[3862.18 --> 3862.66]  All right.
[3862.78 --> 3863.60]  But they have it from
[3863.60 --> 3864.96]  a whole bunch
[3864.96 --> 3866.08]  of different Nintendo titles.
[3866.60 --> 3867.14]  So if you want to
[3867.14 --> 3867.92]  kind of have some fun,
[3868.02 --> 3868.52]  maybe check out
[3868.52 --> 3869.44]  that dorkly thread.
[3872.10 --> 3872.42]  Yeah.
[3872.80 --> 3873.16]  I don't know.
[3873.16 --> 3873.44]  That's cool.
[3873.46 --> 3873.94]  I think it's pretty interesting.
[3874.04 --> 3874.50]  I don't know if there's
[3874.50 --> 3875.38]  like a cutoff date
[3875.38 --> 3876.08]  or anything.
[3876.86 --> 3878.32]  So I don't know.
[3878.44 --> 3879.24]  I didn't see it anywhere
[3879.24 --> 3879.96]  but I don't think
[3879.96 --> 3880.70]  it's that big of a deal.
[3881.22 --> 3882.44]  It's just kind of for fun.
[3882.72 --> 3883.98]  I voted for like five or six
[3883.98 --> 3884.54]  and then I got bored
[3884.54 --> 3885.12]  and closed it.
[3886.84 --> 3887.28]  Closed it.
[3887.36 --> 3887.76]  But you know,
[3887.86 --> 3889.22]  ADHD is a hell of a thing.
[3890.06 --> 3890.68]  I was wondering,
[3890.92 --> 3891.62]  the only reason
[3891.62 --> 3892.28]  why I kept going
[3892.28 --> 3893.04]  and finished the whole thing
[3893.04 --> 3893.86]  was I was actually wondering
[3893.86 --> 3894.60]  how they did it.
[3895.20 --> 3895.96]  Because I would notice
[3895.96 --> 3897.20]  every once in a blue moon
[3897.20 --> 3897.88]  when I was first,
[3898.26 --> 3898.86]  when I went through
[3898.86 --> 3899.40]  the first few
[3899.40 --> 3899.76]  because I was like,
[3899.82 --> 3900.16]  they're going to have
[3900.16 --> 3901.12]  112 matchups.
[3901.22 --> 3901.98]  This is going to be ridiculous.
[3902.56 --> 3903.72]  And then the ranking system
[3903.72 --> 3904.64]  for that is going to be weird
[3904.64 --> 3905.38]  because if you have
[3905.38 --> 3907.66]  like a super popular character
[3907.66 --> 3908.84]  voted against a not
[3908.84 --> 3909.80]  super popular character,
[3909.90 --> 3910.88]  obviously they're going to win.
[3911.64 --> 3912.38]  So I was trying to figure out
[3912.38 --> 3913.04]  how they did it.
[3913.52 --> 3914.36]  So I kept on going
[3914.36 --> 3915.08]  and then I started seeing
[3915.08 --> 3915.82]  things showing up
[3915.82 --> 3916.36]  more and more
[3916.36 --> 3916.78]  and I was like,
[3916.90 --> 3917.96]  I think I understand.
[3918.22 --> 3919.06]  And then when it came down
[3919.06 --> 3919.82]  to the very end
[3919.82 --> 3920.44]  and it was the two
[3920.44 --> 3921.24]  that I had voted for
[3921.24 --> 3922.18]  like a billion times,
[3922.26 --> 3922.50]  I was like,
[3922.60 --> 3922.92]  all right,
[3923.20 --> 3923.58]  I understand.
[3924.30 --> 3924.86]  That's pretty cool.
[3924.86 --> 3927.24]  Next up is Toxic.
[3928.02 --> 3929.44]  Pretty sure I'm saying that right.
[3929.74 --> 3932.44]  It's spelled T-O-X-I-K-K.
[3933.66 --> 3935.00]  So pretty sure it's toxic.
[3935.52 --> 3937.66]  It is a PC only arena FPS.
[3938.22 --> 3940.16]  It's classic FPS style action
[3940.16 --> 3941.22]  like a real tournament
[3941.22 --> 3942.46]  kind of thing going on.
[3942.72 --> 3944.08]  All players are always equal.
[3944.24 --> 3944.94]  So there's no like
[3944.94 --> 3946.62]  leveling system
[3946.62 --> 3947.50]  or perks
[3947.50 --> 3948.84]  or bullshit.
[3949.16 --> 3950.56]  And that's part of the whole idea.
[3950.84 --> 3951.62]  My favorite thing is
[3951.62 --> 3952.18]  it goes through
[3952.18 --> 3952.58]  and it's like,
[3952.86 --> 3953.86]  no leveling system,
[3953.86 --> 3954.68]  no blah, blah, blah,
[3954.80 --> 3955.74]  no all this kind of stuff,
[3955.82 --> 3956.70]  arena style combat.
[3957.18 --> 3958.24]  And then they start
[3958.24 --> 3958.72]  going through stuff
[3958.72 --> 3959.48]  they do have.
[3959.58 --> 3961.46]  They have different arena modes.
[3961.58 --> 3963.46]  They have vehicle mode.
[3963.58 --> 3964.36]  They have all this
[3964.36 --> 3965.20]  other kind of stuff.
[3965.52 --> 3966.50]  And then at the very end
[3966.50 --> 3968.08]  it says free to play.
[3968.36 --> 3968.82]  And I was like,
[3969.14 --> 3970.52]  oh no.
[3970.98 --> 3971.84]  You're going to ruin
[3971.84 --> 3972.62]  the whole thing.
[3972.98 --> 3974.34]  And then there's this huge stamp
[3974.34 --> 3975.10]  that goes right over it.
[3975.14 --> 3975.34]  It's like,
[3975.54 --> 3975.94]  no.
[3976.26 --> 3976.58]  I was like,
[3976.64 --> 3977.14]  yay.
[3978.76 --> 3980.36]  You're like micro transactions.
[3980.78 --> 3981.18]  Just kidding.
[3981.18 --> 3981.74]  Yeah,
[3981.84 --> 3982.22]  seriously.
[3983.54 --> 3984.48]  In the comments
[3984.48 --> 3984.88]  of the video
[3984.88 --> 3986.12]  I saw a billion people
[3986.12 --> 3987.18]  saying that
[3987.18 --> 3988.30]  it's kind of funny
[3988.30 --> 3990.66]  that a marketing stance
[3990.66 --> 3991.62]  nowadays
[3991.62 --> 3992.82]  for a game
[3992.82 --> 3993.50]  is to say
[3993.50 --> 3995.26]  you have to pay for this.
[3995.96 --> 3996.72]  And people are like,
[3996.84 --> 3997.24]  yeah.
[3998.16 --> 3998.56]  I know.
[3998.56 --> 3999.38]  How did that happen?
[4000.06 --> 4001.46]  How messed up
[4001.46 --> 4002.52]  is the gaming industry?
[4002.52 --> 4002.90]  Remember back
[4002.90 --> 4003.96]  in the shareware days,
[4004.02 --> 4004.18]  right?
[4004.22 --> 4004.64]  They'd give you
[4004.64 --> 4005.64]  a part of the game
[4005.64 --> 4006.48]  and then you could pay
[4006.48 --> 4006.94]  if you wanted
[4006.94 --> 4008.36]  the rest of the game.
[4008.36 --> 4009.60]  And that was fine
[4009.60 --> 4010.72]  but now they've changed
[4010.72 --> 4011.42]  the dynamic to where
[4011.42 --> 4011.66]  it's like,
[4011.72 --> 4012.84]  now you go buy the game
[4012.84 --> 4013.74]  or get the game for free
[4013.74 --> 4014.92]  like Blacklight Retribution
[4014.92 --> 4015.74]  for instance.
[4015.74 --> 4016.20]  A lot of people
[4016.20 --> 4016.66]  like that game.
[4016.98 --> 4017.50]  You get in there
[4017.50 --> 4017.90]  and then it's like
[4017.90 --> 4018.80]  people are walking around
[4018.80 --> 4019.32]  with mechs
[4019.32 --> 4021.18]  and got indestructible armor
[4021.18 --> 4022.46]  and you're running around
[4022.46 --> 4023.50]  with your Daisy Red Rider
[4023.50 --> 4024.58]  pump action BB gun.
[4026.00 --> 4027.22]  And it drives me
[4027.22 --> 4028.46]  absolutely nuts.
[4028.46 --> 4029.28]  Or you've got the,
[4029.50 --> 4030.52]  if you have an Intel SSD
[4030.52 --> 4031.24]  you get those boots
[4031.24 --> 4032.10]  that make you run faster.
[4032.40 --> 4032.64]  Yep.
[4032.88 --> 4034.12]  That's why the game's
[4034.12 --> 4035.06]  like Unreal Tournament
[4035.06 --> 4035.42]  and stuff
[4035.42 --> 4036.30]  where you just jump in
[4036.30 --> 4036.64]  and it's like,
[4036.68 --> 4037.98]  it's actually your skill.
[4037.98 --> 4038.92]  It's not like COD
[4038.92 --> 4039.30]  where you're like
[4039.30 --> 4040.26]  level 60 prestige
[4040.26 --> 4040.86]  and you got the gun
[4040.86 --> 4041.62]  where you just push a button
[4041.62 --> 4041.98]  and the bullet
[4041.98 --> 4042.66]  finds somebody
[4042.66 --> 4043.22]  and kills them.
[4043.46 --> 4043.70]  You're just like
[4043.70 --> 4044.92]  pew kill, pew kill.
[4045.08 --> 4045.64]  It's not that bad
[4045.64 --> 4047.50]  but it's still pretty bad.
[4047.78 --> 4047.94]  Yeah.
[4048.88 --> 4050.12]  So the idea is
[4050.12 --> 4050.64]  that they're going to have
[4050.64 --> 4051.90]  classic styled
[4051.90 --> 4053.38]  and massive maps
[4053.38 --> 4054.00]  both of them.
[4054.22 --> 4054.68]  It's going to be
[4054.68 --> 4055.94]  exclusively for PC
[4055.94 --> 4057.30]  which is one of the big things
[4057.30 --> 4057.82]  they're pushing
[4057.82 --> 4059.70]  and it's developed by Reactor.
[4060.14 --> 4060.72]  They're a,
[4060.86 --> 4061.18]  again,
[4061.34 --> 4061.98]  spelled kind of weird
[4061.98 --> 4063.84]  R-E-A-K-K-K-T-O-R.
[4064.40 --> 4065.50]  They're an indie studio
[4065.50 --> 4066.76]  but they have members
[4066.76 --> 4067.94]  that have at least
[4067.94 --> 4068.78]  10 years of experience
[4068.78 --> 4069.56]  with game development
[4069.56 --> 4070.24]  all over the place
[4070.24 --> 4071.66]  so they're kind of a big deal.
[4072.10 --> 4072.68]  I'm pretty excited
[4072.68 --> 4073.38]  for this to come out
[4073.38 --> 4074.62]  but I'm going to curb
[4074.62 --> 4075.22]  my enthusiasm
[4075.22 --> 4077.70]  because the last PC-only
[4077.70 --> 4078.54]  Ra-Ra game
[4078.54 --> 4079.60]  that I really got behind
[4079.60 --> 4080.80]  that released,
[4080.94 --> 4081.66]  so I'm not including
[4081.66 --> 4082.68]  Star Citizen right now,
[4082.94 --> 4084.36]  was Hard Reset
[4084.36 --> 4086.24]  and we might all know
[4086.24 --> 4087.18]  how well that went.
[4087.44 --> 4088.70]  So hopefully this works
[4088.70 --> 4089.38]  quite well.
[4089.38 --> 4092.38]  Not like PC really needs
[4092.38 --> 4093.26]  more exclusives
[4093.26 --> 4094.16]  because we have
[4094.16 --> 4095.40]  tons of them
[4095.40 --> 4097.08]  but I'll welcome it
[4097.08 --> 4099.14]  and hopefully if we get
[4099.14 --> 4100.64]  all of the Xbox exclusives
[4100.64 --> 4101.60]  at some point
[4101.60 --> 4102.34]  so that there aren't
[4102.34 --> 4102.88]  any anymore
[4102.88 --> 4103.58]  and then we have
[4103.58 --> 4104.42]  PC exclusives,
[4104.70 --> 4105.56]  the console guys won't even
[4105.56 --> 4106.64]  have that argument anymore
[4106.64 --> 4107.86]  so I'm cool with that.
[4108.86 --> 4110.06]  PC Master Race!
[4110.22 --> 4110.54]  Yeah!
[4111.34 --> 4111.90]  Anyways,
[4112.10 --> 4112.78]  Crytek's CEO
[4112.78 --> 4113.70]  is actually starting
[4113.70 --> 4114.66]  to pay people again
[4114.66 --> 4115.06]  hopefully
[4115.06 --> 4118.36]  and he has fully admitted
[4118.36 --> 4120.22]  to delaying paychecks.
[4121.36 --> 4121.72]  Sketchy!
[4122.54 --> 4123.32]  Some of the things
[4123.32 --> 4123.88]  that he has said
[4123.88 --> 4124.64]  is that he had
[4124.64 --> 4125.68]  two choices really.
[4126.18 --> 4127.32]  He either had a choice
[4127.32 --> 4128.68]  to delay paychecks
[4128.68 --> 4130.12]  delay,
[4130.60 --> 4131.02]  I mean not,
[4131.28 --> 4132.08]  they're not getting paid
[4132.08 --> 4132.90]  he's just delaying them
[4132.90 --> 4133.72]  to a further date
[4133.72 --> 4136.14]  or to push your cash flow
[4136.14 --> 4136.94]  directly to studios
[4136.94 --> 4138.94]  and file for insolvency
[4138.94 --> 4139.98]  because basically
[4139.98 --> 4140.40]  he's saying
[4140.40 --> 4141.42]  he had to delay paychecks
[4141.42 --> 4142.30]  or get rid of
[4142.30 --> 4143.34]  the entire company.
[4143.66 --> 4144.86]  Both of them were bad
[4144.86 --> 4145.60]  and he had to make
[4145.60 --> 4146.54]  a decision
[4146.54 --> 4147.96]  out of two bad decisions
[4147.96 --> 4148.72]  which is actually
[4148.72 --> 4149.36]  a pretty good point.
[4149.98 --> 4150.86]  He's saying that
[4150.86 --> 4153.48]  he also informed employees
[4153.48 --> 4155.28]  that they told everyone
[4155.28 --> 4155.92]  that this was going
[4155.92 --> 4156.42]  to happen
[4156.42 --> 4157.46]  and said that
[4157.46 --> 4158.24]  they would offer help
[4158.24 --> 4159.50]  if people wanted to
[4159.50 --> 4160.86]  essentially resign
[4160.86 --> 4162.20]  and find another job.
[4163.66 --> 4165.64]  I was all on it
[4165.64 --> 4166.46]  when he had his little
[4166.46 --> 4167.54]  pep talk about being like
[4167.54 --> 4168.62]  I was stuck between
[4168.62 --> 4169.76]  a rock and a hard place
[4169.76 --> 4170.46]  and I had to make
[4170.46 --> 4171.68]  one bad decision
[4171.68 --> 4172.22]  out of two
[4172.22 --> 4172.80]  blah blah blah blah blah
[4172.80 --> 4174.04]  but then when he's like
[4174.04 --> 4174.92]  I gave them the option
[4174.92 --> 4176.38]  to freely resign
[4176.38 --> 4178.50]  or get a delayed paycheck
[4178.50 --> 4179.66]  I think at that point
[4179.66 --> 4180.38]  in time you have to
[4180.38 --> 4181.44]  give them a severance package
[4181.44 --> 4182.54]  because you're being a jerk.
[4183.56 --> 4184.64]  Doesn't matter if you
[4184.64 --> 4185.96]  only had two bad decisions
[4185.96 --> 4187.32]  you're still being a jerk.
[4187.46 --> 4187.94]  Doesn't matter if you
[4187.94 --> 4188.64]  had to be a jerk
[4188.64 --> 4189.90]  you're still being a jerk.
[4190.04 --> 4190.66]  I don't think you have
[4190.66 --> 4191.04]  to be like
[4191.04 --> 4192.54]  you quit for nothing
[4192.54 --> 4193.36]  and we'll help you
[4193.36 --> 4194.30]  find another job
[4194.30 --> 4195.54]  or you take a delayed
[4195.54 --> 4195.88]  paycheck.
[4195.88 --> 4196.76]  That's not right.
[4196.96 --> 4197.86]  That's not right at all.
[4197.86 --> 4200.00]  So I do feel bad
[4200.00 --> 4200.52]  for the dude
[4200.52 --> 4201.64]  and I'm happy
[4201.64 --> 4202.60]  that they did get
[4202.60 --> 4203.48]  a whole bunch of money
[4203.48 --> 4205.26]  from their not saying yet
[4205.26 --> 4208.28]  but I don't know
[4208.28 --> 4209.40]  maybe still kind of
[4209.40 --> 4209.86]  dealt with it
[4209.86 --> 4210.82]  a little bit better
[4210.82 --> 4212.08]  by treating your employees
[4212.08 --> 4212.90]  a little bit better
[4212.90 --> 4214.08]  then if you did
[4214.08 --> 4214.86]  this leak probably
[4214.86 --> 4215.44]  wouldn't have been
[4215.44 --> 4216.10]  as bad
[4216.10 --> 4216.74]  considering you've been
[4216.74 --> 4217.80]  on all of the last
[4217.80 --> 4218.64]  like three or four
[4218.64 --> 4219.26]  WAN shows
[4219.26 --> 4220.08]  you're probably
[4220.08 --> 4221.26]  doing something wrong.
[4221.98 --> 4222.82]  Usually if you do
[4222.82 --> 4223.70]  something really good
[4223.70 --> 4225.00]  you get on one WAN show.
[4225.76 --> 4226.24]  Anyways
[4226.24 --> 4228.30]  so in other news
[4228.30 --> 4229.42]  EA is not doing
[4229.42 --> 4230.14]  something terrible
[4230.14 --> 4230.86]  they're giving
[4230.86 --> 4232.88]  BF4 trial
[4232.88 --> 4234.08]  for a week
[4234.08 --> 4234.86]  I believe it's
[4234.86 --> 4236.92]  168 hours
[4236.92 --> 4237.86]  of game time
[4237.86 --> 4238.94]  so you can clock
[4238.94 --> 4240.16]  those game time hours
[4240.16 --> 4241.04]  whenever you want
[4241.04 --> 4241.66]  because of
[4241.66 --> 4242.66]  their kind of
[4242.66 --> 4243.36]  free to play system.
[4243.78 --> 4245.04]  Not too surprising though
[4245.04 --> 4246.04]  because Hardline's coming
[4246.04 --> 4246.84]  or is already out
[4246.84 --> 4247.30]  I don't know
[4247.30 --> 4248.06]  it's coming right?
[4248.40 --> 4249.48]  Yeah they released
[4249.48 --> 4250.22]  the beta for a little while
[4250.22 --> 4251.04]  and then they pulled it back
[4251.04 --> 4251.74]  so we don't know
[4251.74 --> 4252.80]  I don't actually know
[4252.80 --> 4254.18]  what the release time
[4254.18 --> 4254.64]  for the game is
[4254.64 --> 4255.32]  but I liked it.
[4255.32 --> 4256.02]  I actually thought
[4256.02 --> 4256.62]  it was pretty cool.
[4257.04 --> 4257.76]  Yeah so my
[4257.76 --> 4258.86]  thought process on this
[4258.86 --> 4259.44]  is they're probably
[4259.44 --> 4260.14]  trying to build hype
[4260.14 --> 4261.06]  for Battlefield 4 again
[4261.06 --> 4262.42]  so they can drop Hardline
[4262.42 --> 4263.70]  and then all the people
[4263.70 --> 4264.46]  that got all the hype
[4264.46 --> 4265.14]  for Battlefield 4
[4265.14 --> 4265.90]  can buy Hardline.
[4266.90 --> 4267.50]  I think they're just
[4267.50 --> 4268.28]  making a mad scramble
[4268.28 --> 4268.96]  to get a bunch of people
[4268.96 --> 4270.08]  to beta test their netcode
[4270.08 --> 4270.68]  so that they can get
[4270.68 --> 4272.04]  issues worked out early.
[4272.66 --> 4273.44]  One of those two
[4273.44 --> 4274.62]  I think totally makes sense.
[4274.64 --> 4275.38]  I'm voting for
[4275.38 --> 4276.50]  you're being used.
[4277.02 --> 4277.62]  Yeah yeah yeah.
[4277.96 --> 4278.84]  Either way though
[4278.84 --> 4279.54]  it's kind of cool
[4279.54 --> 4280.72]  because 168 hours
[4280.72 --> 4281.70]  is quite a bit of time.
[4281.70 --> 4282.94]  Dude free is free.
[4283.22 --> 4283.48]  Yeah.
[4283.48 --> 4284.52]  That's the thing is
[4284.52 --> 4285.58]  I tend not to complain
[4285.58 --> 4286.40]  as much about games
[4286.40 --> 4286.82]  that are free
[4286.82 --> 4287.36]  as the games
[4287.36 --> 4288.50]  I've paid like $400
[4288.50 --> 4289.40]  to play.
[4289.86 --> 4290.68]  Electronic Arts
[4290.68 --> 4291.58]  gotta buy your
[4291.58 --> 4292.32]  Battlefield 4
[4292.32 --> 4292.70]  on what is it?
[4292.74 --> 4293.02]  Xbox.
[4293.56 --> 4294.66]  I got an Xbox 360
[4294.66 --> 4295.50]  Xbox One
[4295.50 --> 4296.46]  PlayStation 4
[4296.46 --> 4297.02]  and PC
[4297.02 --> 4297.66]  and two of them
[4297.66 --> 4298.50]  I got premium on.
[4298.80 --> 4299.18]  Why?
[4299.86 --> 4300.38]  Because they took
[4300.38 --> 4300.80]  all my money
[4300.80 --> 4301.32]  they wanted to take
[4301.32 --> 4301.62]  my money
[4301.62 --> 4302.50]  so I just gave it to them
[4302.50 --> 4302.72]  I was like
[4302.72 --> 4305.70]  because I have people
[4305.70 --> 4306.18]  I play with
[4306.18 --> 4306.66]  on all those
[4306.66 --> 4307.20]  different consoles
[4307.20 --> 4307.78]  I got friends
[4307.78 --> 4308.16]  I play with
[4308.16 --> 4308.42]  Yeah.
[4309.14 --> 4309.54]  You need to
[4309.54 --> 4310.06]  consolidate
[4310.06 --> 4311.10]  your friends list
[4311.10 --> 4311.50]  man.
[4311.92 --> 4312.48]  I'm going to start
[4312.48 --> 4312.76]  doing that
[4312.76 --> 4312.96]  I'm going to
[4312.96 --> 4313.50]  list be like
[4313.50 --> 4314.08]  yeah no
[4314.08 --> 4314.86]  you got a PS4
[4314.86 --> 4315.12]  dude
[4315.12 --> 4316.20]  I can't hang out
[4316.20 --> 4317.00]  with you anymore.
[4317.40 --> 4318.04]  Yeah I'm sorry
[4318.04 --> 4318.44]  I've already got
[4318.44 --> 4319.16]  like three people
[4319.16 --> 4319.54]  over here
[4319.54 --> 4320.32]  on this other console
[4320.32 --> 4320.72]  so I'm just
[4320.72 --> 4320.96]  going to have to
[4320.96 --> 4321.44]  let you go
[4321.44 --> 4321.90]  I'm sorry.
[4322.26 --> 4322.70]  Here's your
[4322.70 --> 4323.58]  severance package
[4323.58 --> 4323.92]  and I'll
[4323.92 --> 4324.68]  get some back.
[4325.26 --> 4326.02]  Your severance package
[4326.02 --> 4326.94]  is like a bag of cookies.
[4327.16 --> 4327.84]  It is yeah
[4327.84 --> 4328.42]  it's a bag of pickles
[4328.42 --> 4328.98]  and like a code
[4328.98 --> 4329.60]  for like a free
[4329.60 --> 4330.70]  $5 game off Steam.
[4332.30 --> 4332.66]  Yes.
[4332.88 --> 4333.44]  Oh man
[4333.44 --> 4333.92]  I probably shouldn't
[4333.92 --> 4334.22]  have clapped
[4334.22 --> 4334.74]  in front of the mic
[4334.74 --> 4335.94]  but yeah
[4335.94 --> 4336.72]  that's kind of
[4336.72 --> 4337.22]  brutal man
[4337.22 --> 4337.58]  I don't know
[4337.58 --> 4338.40]  if I could do that.
[4339.14 --> 4339.54]  I usually
[4339.54 --> 4340.42]  try to find
[4340.42 --> 4341.06]  the most people
[4341.06 --> 4341.48]  that are going to
[4341.48 --> 4342.26]  play a specific
[4342.26 --> 4343.30]  game on a specific
[4343.30 --> 4344.06]  platform which
[4344.06 --> 4345.10]  nowadays is almost
[4345.10 --> 4345.74]  always PC
[4345.74 --> 4346.38]  thank you
[4346.38 --> 4347.28]  group of friends
[4347.28 --> 4349.22]  but and then
[4349.22 --> 4349.72]  I would buy it
[4349.72 --> 4350.22]  for that
[4350.22 --> 4350.92]  so like back
[4350.92 --> 4351.20]  in the day
[4351.20 --> 4352.26]  I did get Halo 2
[4352.26 --> 4353.94]  so I played it
[4353.94 --> 4354.70]  on Xbox
[4354.70 --> 4355.54]  obviously because
[4355.54 --> 4356.04]  a whole bunch
[4356.04 --> 4356.42]  of my friends
[4356.42 --> 4357.50]  played so I did
[4357.50 --> 4357.90]  do that
[4357.90 --> 4358.58]  I've followed
[4358.58 --> 4359.20]  friends into
[4359.20 --> 4359.70]  buying things
[4359.70 --> 4360.08]  but I don't
[4360.08 --> 4360.62]  think I've ever
[4360.62 --> 4361.58]  bought something
[4361.58 --> 4362.58]  on two different
[4362.58 --> 4363.62]  platforms before
[4363.62 --> 4365.28]  not even two
[4365.28 --> 4366.04]  and then you
[4366.04 --> 4366.42]  bought it for
[4366.42 --> 4366.80]  how many?
[4367.18 --> 4368.02]  I got it on
[4368.02 --> 4368.38]  like four
[4368.38 --> 4368.76]  no four
[4368.76 --> 4369.32]  platforms
[4369.32 --> 4370.56]  360
[4370.56 --> 4371.96]  PlayStation 4
[4371.96 --> 4373.92]  Xbox One
[4373.92 --> 4375.12]  and PC
[4375.12 --> 4375.92]  PC okay
[4375.92 --> 4376.16]  yeah
[4376.16 --> 4377.04]  I'm all over
[4377.04 --> 4377.50]  the place
[4377.50 --> 4378.24]  that's pretty
[4378.24 --> 4378.42]  it's hurt
[4378.42 --> 4378.86]  it's hurt
[4378.86 --> 4379.48]  for me
[4379.48 --> 4381.28]  luckily you don't
[4381.28 --> 4381.70]  have anyone
[4381.70 --> 4382.42]  with Wii U
[4382.42 --> 4382.84]  the thing is
[4382.84 --> 4383.46]  it sucks on
[4383.46 --> 4383.84]  every one of
[4383.84 --> 4384.26]  the platforms
[4384.26 --> 4384.68]  yet I keep
[4384.68 --> 4384.96]  giving them
[4384.96 --> 4385.22]  my money
[4385.22 --> 4385.64]  I don't get
[4385.64 --> 4386.06]  it
[4386.06 --> 4387.16]  their marketing
[4387.16 --> 4387.72]  department is
[4387.72 --> 4388.38]  phenomenal
[4388.38 --> 4389.46]  you know I
[4389.46 --> 4390.10]  actually really
[4390.10 --> 4391.48]  liked Battlefield
[4391.48 --> 4392.08]  3
[4392.08 --> 4393.06]  I did too
[4393.06 --> 4393.44]  that was my
[4393.44 --> 4394.26]  all time
[4394.26 --> 4394.52]  favorite
[4394.52 --> 4394.88]  Battlefield
[4394.88 --> 4395.68]  my favorite
[4395.68 --> 4396.16]  one was
[4396.16 --> 4399.00]  honestly 1942
[4399.00 --> 4400.18]  but Bad Company
[4400.18 --> 4400.90]  2 was pretty
[4400.90 --> 4401.42]  good I played
[4401.42 --> 4401.86]  it for quite a
[4401.86 --> 4402.04]  while
[4402.04 --> 4403.90]  but Battlefield
[4403.90 --> 4404.52]  3 I played
[4404.52 --> 4405.04]  a fair amount
[4405.04 --> 4405.60]  and despite
[4405.60 --> 4406.12]  all the bull
[4406.12 --> 4406.72]  crap it was
[4406.72 --> 4407.54]  somewhat okay
[4407.54 --> 4409.16]  and then Battlefield
[4409.16 --> 4409.78]  4 came out
[4409.78 --> 4410.22]  and I just can't
[4410.22 --> 4410.60]  deal with their
[4410.60 --> 4411.66]  junk anymore
[4411.66 --> 4412.48]  I can't believe
[4412.48 --> 4413.36]  Battlelog still
[4413.36 --> 4413.94]  isn't fixed
[4413.94 --> 4415.94]  the netcode's so
[4415.94 --> 4416.58]  bad though
[4416.58 --> 4417.30]  how did they go
[4417.30 --> 4418.18]  from like decent
[4418.18 --> 4418.88]  netcode to such
[4418.88 --> 4419.78]  horrible netcode
[4419.78 --> 4420.38]  like the rubber
[4420.38 --> 4421.58]  banding and the
[4421.58 --> 4422.32]  random pauses
[4422.32 --> 4423.02]  and like the
[4423.02 --> 4423.58]  hit markers
[4423.58 --> 4424.38]  are you shooting
[4424.38 --> 4424.80]  some dude
[4424.80 --> 4425.02]  or whatever
[4425.02 --> 4425.42]  you just shoot
[4425.42 --> 4425.94]  out of nowhere
[4425.94 --> 4426.28]  and it's like
[4426.28 --> 4426.92]  some guy dies
[4426.92 --> 4427.16]  you're like
[4427.16 --> 4427.74]  where was he
[4427.74 --> 4428.10]  and then he
[4428.10 --> 4428.68]  just like appears
[4428.68 --> 4429.46]  and dies in front
[4429.46 --> 4429.66]  of you
[4429.66 --> 4430.00]  you're like
[4430.00 --> 4430.50]  uh
[4430.50 --> 4432.02]  this is wrong
[4432.02 --> 4433.62]  very wrong
[4433.62 --> 4435.26]  I don't know man
[4435.26 --> 4437.22]  it's no good
[4437.22 --> 4438.10]  um
[4438.10 --> 4439.72]  and it seems like
[4439.72 --> 4440.24]  every single time
[4440.24 --> 4440.62]  and people
[4440.62 --> 4441.26]  people play me
[4441.26 --> 4441.62]  for this
[4441.62 --> 4442.56]  every single time
[4442.56 --> 4442.94]  but I'm gonna
[4442.94 --> 4443.60]  keep on saying
[4443.60 --> 4444.12]  it because it's
[4444.12 --> 4444.38]  true
[4444.38 --> 4445.44]  every time I go
[4445.44 --> 4445.90]  try to play
[4445.90 --> 4446.42]  the game
[4446.42 --> 4447.70]  you can't just
[4447.70 --> 4448.92]  launch the game
[4448.92 --> 4449.62]  nope
[4449.62 --> 4450.56]  it's impossible
[4450.56 --> 4451.74]  there's a battle log
[4451.74 --> 4452.08]  update
[4452.08 --> 4452.88]  there's an origin
[4452.88 --> 4453.34]  update
[4453.34 --> 4453.92]  there's an update
[4453.92 --> 4454.78]  for the game
[4454.78 --> 4455.58]  punk busters
[4455.58 --> 4456.22]  bitching about
[4456.22 --> 4456.56]  something
[4456.56 --> 4457.94]  didn't work at
[4457.94 --> 4458.86]  all because it
[4458.86 --> 4459.78]  never does
[4459.78 --> 4460.98]  and then for some
[4460.98 --> 4461.44]  reason there's
[4461.44 --> 4462.18]  the friends list
[4462.18 --> 4463.64]  is down or not
[4463.64 --> 4464.66]  working or the
[4464.66 --> 4465.28]  server's having
[4465.28 --> 4466.14]  problems or
[4466.14 --> 4466.96]  there's a sound
[4466.96 --> 4467.72]  bug which just
[4467.72 --> 4468.20]  makes it so the
[4468.20 --> 4468.88]  entire server is
[4468.88 --> 4469.74]  muted and it's like
[4469.74 --> 4470.98]  oh my god I just
[4470.98 --> 4471.84]  want to play
[4471.84 --> 4472.72]  leave me alone
[4472.72 --> 4473.62]  this is the only
[4473.62 --> 4474.16]  reason I like
[4474.16 --> 4474.78]  consoles Luke
[4474.78 --> 4475.68]  the only reason
[4475.68 --> 4476.30]  is because you go
[4476.30 --> 4476.98]  you put the damn
[4476.98 --> 4477.72]  CD in the thing
[4477.72 --> 4479.24]  most of the time
[4479.24 --> 4479.70]  I'm not going to
[4479.70 --> 4480.22]  say all the time
[4480.22 --> 4480.60]  because I still
[4480.60 --> 4481.16]  get that stupid
[4481.16 --> 4481.52]  you got to
[4481.52 --> 4482.46]  download 7 gigabyte
[4482.46 --> 4483.10]  update every other
[4483.10 --> 4483.68]  day but I'm going
[4483.68 --> 4484.18]  to blow you up
[4484.18 --> 4485.40]  for this because I
[4485.40 --> 4486.70]  tried to do a
[4486.70 --> 4488.78]  keymander video not
[4488.78 --> 4489.72]  even that long ago
[4489.72 --> 4490.74]  you know I'm sure
[4490.74 --> 4491.04]  you know what
[4491.04 --> 4491.62]  keymander is
[4491.62 --> 4492.74]  I have no idea
[4492.74 --> 4493.54]  what the hell is
[4493.54 --> 4494.26]  keymander it's
[4494.26 --> 4494.90]  this little in
[4494.90 --> 4495.70]  between so you can
[4495.70 --> 4496.42]  plug a keyboard and
[4496.42 --> 4496.96]  mouse into your
[4496.96 --> 4497.96]  console oh I've
[4497.96 --> 4498.62]  got I've got one of
[4498.62 --> 4499.22]  those it's just it's
[4499.22 --> 4499.60]  from a different
[4499.60 --> 4500.44]  company yeah
[4500.44 --> 4503.32]  yeah I tried to do
[4503.32 --> 4503.96]  a video on that
[4503.96 --> 4505.14]  and the problem
[4505.14 --> 4506.44]  ended up being that
[4506.44 --> 4507.48]  it took me so long
[4507.48 --> 4508.34]  to set up originally
[4508.34 --> 4510.60]  because I put I
[4510.60 --> 4511.60]  turned the Xbox on
[4511.60 --> 4512.22]  and first of all
[4512.22 --> 4513.44]  there's this massive
[4513.44 --> 4514.60]  update and I'm like
[4514.60 --> 4516.86]  okay whatever we
[4516.86 --> 4517.66]  don't use Xbox one
[4517.66 --> 4519.54]  that much at all so
[4519.54 --> 4520.22]  it makes sense that I
[4520.22 --> 4520.68]  had to do this
[4520.68 --> 4521.78]  massive update but
[4521.78 --> 4522.66]  then I put a dead
[4522.66 --> 4523.76]  rising 3 disc in
[4523.76 --> 4524.74]  that I had from a
[4524.74 --> 4525.30]  buddy who is a
[4525.30 --> 4526.38]  developer on the
[4526.38 --> 4527.44]  game so it's like
[4527.44 --> 4528.58]  the the case is all
[4528.58 --> 4529.14]  signed and everything
[4529.14 --> 4529.80]  it's kind of cool but
[4529.80 --> 4530.30]  I've never played it
[4530.30 --> 4531.46]  before so I put the
[4531.46 --> 4533.44]  disc in and it
[4533.44 --> 4534.90]  wouldn't load it
[4534.90 --> 4536.08]  says please put an
[4536.08 --> 4536.90]  Xbox game or
[4536.90 --> 4537.76]  identifiable media
[4537.76 --> 4538.62]  disc in the system
[4538.62 --> 4539.34]  something along those
[4539.34 --> 4540.40]  lines and I'm like
[4540.40 --> 4542.56]  oh okay the disc is
[4542.56 --> 4543.22]  dead I've never
[4543.22 --> 4543.92]  played it before so
[4543.92 --> 4544.34]  I wasn't too
[4544.34 --> 4545.14]  surprised for a few
[4545.14 --> 4546.36]  months sorry buddy but
[4546.36 --> 4547.26]  I didn't play your
[4547.26 --> 4549.28]  game so Linus sends
[4549.28 --> 4549.98]  me off to the store
[4549.98 --> 4551.22]  and I find a $20
[4551.22 --> 4552.98]  copy of Call of Duty
[4552.98 --> 4553.68]  Ghost which was
[4553.68 --> 4554.66]  hilarious because it
[4554.66 --> 4556.50]  was so cheap and I
[4556.50 --> 4557.02]  bring it back to
[4557.02 --> 4557.84]  play on my Xbox one
[4557.84 --> 4559.34]  and I put that in and
[4559.34 --> 4560.64]  it doesn't load and
[4560.64 --> 4562.10]  I'm like what the
[4562.10 --> 4562.98]  hell okay so my
[4562.98 --> 4565.08]  Xbox is broken and I
[4565.08 --> 4566.34]  go to like lay it
[4566.34 --> 4567.10]  down so that I can
[4567.10 --> 4568.46]  unplug everything and
[4568.46 --> 4569.98]  when I lay it down it
[4569.98 --> 4570.42]  reads
[4570.42 --> 4572.70]  nice
[4572.70 --> 4575.02]  like really you
[4575.02 --> 4576.02]  don't have vertical
[4576.02 --> 4577.52]  disc reading support
[4577.52 --> 4580.50]  I don't know if
[4580.50 --> 4581.02]  that's actually an
[4581.02 --> 4581.86]  issue with everyone but
[4581.86 --> 4582.74]  we had that problem
[4582.74 --> 4584.76]  which is just sad it
[4584.76 --> 4586.10]  didn't work at all and
[4586.10 --> 4587.24]  then finally I'm like
[4587.24 --> 4589.26]  okay the game's working
[4589.26 --> 4589.88]  now I'm just gonna
[4589.88 --> 4591.12]  launch it play right
[4591.12 --> 4591.86]  away because it's a
[4591.86 --> 4592.66]  console there obviously
[4592.66 --> 4593.46]  be no problem so I'm
[4593.46 --> 4593.90]  just gonna put the
[4593.90 --> 4594.44]  disc in it's gonna
[4594.44 --> 4595.38]  work right that's how
[4595.38 --> 4596.88]  consoles work massive
[4596.88 --> 4598.36]  download required
[4598.36 --> 4599.90]  Call of Duty Ghost
[4599.90 --> 4601.18]  needs this like huge
[4601.18 --> 4602.16]  download it has to
[4602.16 --> 4603.44]  install locally on the
[4603.44 --> 4604.32]  system and I'm like
[4604.32 --> 4606.02]  this is this isn't a
[4606.02 --> 4606.92]  console it's you're not
[4606.92 --> 4607.58]  putting the disc in and
[4607.58 --> 4608.60]  it works when I try to
[4608.60 --> 4610.08]  play a game on my Wii if
[4610.08 --> 4611.08]  there's a download it
[4611.08 --> 4612.54]  takes two seconds and
[4612.54 --> 4613.92]  it works immediately and
[4613.92 --> 4614.66]  it just launches the
[4614.66 --> 4616.46]  game automatically this
[4616.46 --> 4617.36]  one had to install it
[4617.36 --> 4618.66]  locally and download the
[4618.66 --> 4620.64]  biggest patch ever and
[4620.64 --> 4621.36]  it took up the whole
[4621.36 --> 4622.60]  rest of the day and I
[4622.60 --> 4623.34]  wasn't even able to get
[4623.34 --> 4624.52]  that video done and
[4624.52 --> 4625.50]  now it's just sitting on
[4625.50 --> 4626.62]  my desk and I haven't
[4626.62 --> 4627.44]  looked at it in weeks
[4627.44 --> 4628.20]  because I'm just like
[4628.20 --> 4628.50]  screw you
[4628.50 --> 4629.42]  I think the whole update
[4629.42 --> 4630.86]  thing is is completely
[4630.86 --> 4633.10]  stupid like it doesn't
[4633.10 --> 4633.96]  seem like they even try
[4633.96 --> 4634.82]  to get the updates that
[4634.82 --> 4635.56]  small because it's like
[4635.56 --> 4636.80]  oh you look at the you
[4636.80 --> 4637.78]  look like the change list
[4637.78 --> 4638.52]  and the change list is
[4638.52 --> 4639.58]  like oh we've improved
[4639.58 --> 4640.88]  net code slightly yet it
[4640.88 --> 4641.68]  has to download like
[4641.68 --> 4642.92]  eight gigabytes of like
[4642.92 --> 4644.38]  you know world maps and
[4644.38 --> 4646.02]  textures and it's like
[4646.02 --> 4647.32]  it just doesn't seem like
[4647.32 --> 4648.48]  they try to minimize that
[4648.48 --> 4649.56]  patching process they almost
[4649.56 --> 4650.36]  like make you download the
[4650.36 --> 4651.34]  whole game every time it
[4651.34 --> 4652.02]  drives me nuts
[4652.02 --> 4653.90]  they just it seems like
[4653.90 --> 4654.86]  they tried to find
[4654.86 --> 4655.72]  anything that could
[4655.72 --> 4656.74]  possibly be annoying
[4656.74 --> 4658.18]  about a PC version of
[4658.18 --> 4659.50]  the game and then made
[4659.50 --> 4660.62]  it happen on Xbox
[4660.62 --> 4661.60]  I remember when I bought
[4661.60 --> 4662.64]  Battlefield 4 it was like
[4662.64 --> 4663.34]  what was it a four
[4663.34 --> 4665.56]  gigabyte gigabyte update
[4665.56 --> 4666.98]  for that thing literally
[4666.98 --> 4667.94]  I had to start the update
[4667.94 --> 4668.98]  and like go eat dinner
[4668.98 --> 4670.08]  and you know go to the
[4670.08 --> 4671.62]  lawn and go to work for a
[4671.62 --> 4672.22]  week yeah no it's
[4672.22 --> 4672.62]  ridiculous
[4672.62 --> 4673.72]  people are asking why I
[4673.72 --> 4674.62]  got Call of Duty Ghost
[4674.62 --> 4675.54]  it's because it was the
[4675.54 --> 4676.62]  cheapest game I could have
[4676.62 --> 4677.82]  possibly bought for Xbox
[4677.82 --> 4678.66]  One it's not because I
[4678.66 --> 4679.70]  wanted to play it I was
[4679.70 --> 4680.60]  trying to buy a game that
[4680.60 --> 4681.76]  was a first-person shooter
[4681.76 --> 4683.06]  that was as cheap as
[4683.06 --> 4683.84]  possible because all I
[4683.84 --> 4684.70]  wanted to do was show that
[4684.70 --> 4685.50]  you could use a keyboard and
[4685.50 --> 4687.38]  mouse in that game and
[4687.38 --> 4688.38]  Dead Rising isn't
[4688.38 --> 4689.68]  necessarily the right game
[4689.68 --> 4690.88]  to properly show that off
[4690.88 --> 4692.18]  for so I wanted to be able
[4692.18 --> 4693.86]  to show fine movement with
[4693.86 --> 4695.18]  a mouse so I thought of
[4695.18 --> 4696.68]  getting Call of Duty Ghosts
[4696.68 --> 4698.56]  but yeah I got frustrated by
[4698.56 --> 4700.54]  the stupid X-Bone so I
[4700.54 --> 4701.46]  kind of gave up on that
[4701.46 --> 4702.34]  maybe I'll finish that video
[4702.34 --> 4702.96]  at some point in time
[4702.96 --> 4703.82]  because I think it's kind of
[4703.82 --> 4704.58]  cool you can go to your
[4704.58 --> 4705.82]  buddy's house that insists on
[4705.82 --> 4706.68]  playing console and you can
[4706.68 --> 4707.58]  bring your keymander and
[4707.58 --> 4708.44]  wreck him because you have a
[4708.44 --> 4711.18]  keyboard and mouse but people
[4711.18 --> 4712.46]  get so mad at you if you
[4712.46 --> 4713.46]  announce that you use that
[4713.46 --> 4715.62]  though like I did a video
[4715.62 --> 4716.32]  where I was on my test
[4716.32 --> 4717.40]  I'm like hey guys look I'm
[4717.40 --> 4718.36]  using my keyboard and mouse
[4718.36 --> 4720.10]  oh god oh you're a big
[4720.10 --> 4720.86]  cheater and I wasn't even
[4720.86 --> 4721.78]  winning or anything I was
[4721.78 --> 4722.90]  like still sucked horribly
[4722.90 --> 4724.88]  but you kind of are because
[4724.88 --> 4726.62]  it's so much better and like
[4726.62 --> 4727.70]  I'm not even just master
[4727.70 --> 4728.80]  racing right here keyboard and
[4728.80 --> 4731.62]  mouse is so much better than
[4731.62 --> 4733.78]  a controller and it even is
[4733.78 --> 4734.62]  when you use something like a
[4734.62 --> 4736.34]  keymander because you can
[4736.34 --> 4737.42]  change your sensitivity and
[4737.42 --> 4738.30]  stuff so you could make it
[4738.30 --> 4741.68]  almost not really but you
[4741.68 --> 4742.58]  can make it a fairly similar
[4742.58 --> 4743.96]  experience to using input
[4743.96 --> 4745.46]  devices on a normal computer
[4745.46 --> 4746.30]  it's not going to be as great
[4746.30 --> 4748.64]  but close kind of interesting
[4748.64 --> 4750.52]  but yeah it's it's it's an
[4750.52 --> 4751.50]  interesting video because I
[4751.50 --> 4752.48]  want to make it so that
[4752.48 --> 4754.70]  essentially based around how
[4754.70 --> 4757.08]  to just completely wreck all
[4757.08 --> 4758.02]  of your console friends
[4758.02 --> 4758.94]  because you can bring this
[4758.94 --> 4759.84]  around with you because I
[4759.84 --> 4761.10]  think it works with Xbox one
[4761.10 --> 4763.42]  Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 I
[4764.00 --> 4765.22]  think mine only works with
[4765.22 --> 4766.86]  360 like it doesn't I don't
[4766.86 --> 4767.68]  think it worked with anything
[4767.68 --> 4768.48]  else I'll have to check I
[4768.48 --> 4770.10]  think it's a Zim Zim edge or
[4770.10 --> 4772.34]  something okay yeah yeah it
[4772.34 --> 4773.30]  was cool how configurable it
[4773.30 --> 4773.78]  is though because you can
[4773.78 --> 4775.06]  set up macros and literally do
[4775.06 --> 4776.38]  everything the timing between
[4776.38 --> 4777.44]  button I mean you can
[4777.44 --> 4779.84]  literally make one key like do
[4779.84 --> 4781.32]  a like a combo like if you're
[4781.32 --> 4782.22]  playing Mortal Kombat or so
[4782.22 --> 4783.28]  if you have one key be like a
[4783.28 --> 4785.60]  half moon BA and like always
[4785.60 --> 4787.48]  nail that move so yeah I guess
[4787.48 --> 4788.52]  I guess that is pretty pretty
[4788.52 --> 4790.34]  pretty cheater device it's I'm
[4790.34 --> 4791.74]  gonna take that to MLG and just
[4791.74 --> 4793.40]  dominate oh yes I'll bring my
[4793.40 --> 4794.46]  keyboard and mouse to my console
[4794.46 --> 4797.44]  tournament um I I know like
[4797.44 --> 4799.10]  who was I trying to say here
[4799.10 --> 4801.64]  I I know a while ago there was
[4801.64 --> 4803.30]  internal controller mods that
[4803.30 --> 4804.42]  you could do where you can make
[4804.42 --> 4805.98]  it so you just hold down fire
[4805.98 --> 4807.64]  and it would fire semi-automatic
[4807.64 --> 4810.14]  weapons at full speed so you
[4810.14 --> 4811.46]  take like single shot rifles and
[4811.46 --> 4814.40]  big back and like that I
[4814.40 --> 4815.12]  remember back in the old
[4815.12 --> 4816.14]  Nintendo games they used to have
[4816.14 --> 4817.44]  those power controllers that you
[4817.44 --> 4818.72]  get where you'd flip to a little
[4818.72 --> 4820.30]  whatever give you turbo rapid
[4820.30 --> 4821.52]  fire you'd have like six buttons
[4821.52 --> 4822.98]  instead of four buttons instead
[4822.98 --> 4824.78]  of two yeah that was awesome I
[4824.78 --> 4825.68]  love that especially in those
[4825.68 --> 4826.88]  games where you had like sit
[4826.88 --> 4828.02]  there and just button mash the
[4828.02 --> 4829.02]  hell out of something to achieve
[4829.02 --> 4829.98]  a goal you just hold the button
[4829.98 --> 4833.56]  down and be like yeah I win this
[4833.56 --> 4835.78]  yeah I don't know those are
[4835.78 --> 4837.08]  those are pretty cool but they
[4837.08 --> 4838.56]  are definitely definitely
[4838.56 --> 4840.12]  shooter devices but I hope to
[4840.12 --> 4841.24]  have a video on that eventually
[4841.24 --> 4842.68]  although every single time I go
[4842.68 --> 4843.90]  work on that project I just get
[4843.90 --> 4845.44]  super pissed at the Xbox and
[4845.44 --> 4847.46]  quits so I don't know when that's
[4847.46 --> 4848.16]  gonna be ready
[4848.16 --> 4849.66]  at least you don't have to wrap
[4849.66 --> 4850.64]  it in the blanket to make it
[4850.64 --> 4851.20]  work okay
[4851.20 --> 4853.16]  yeah maybe
[4853.16 --> 4857.40]  so we get to do something fairly
[4857.40 --> 4858.42]  fun actually
[4858.42 --> 4860.46]  can you
[4860.46 --> 4862.74]  no I don't think so
[4862.74 --> 4864.04]  maybe not all right I'm just
[4864.04 --> 4864.54]  gonna do this
[4864.54 --> 4867.22]  I have to play around with screen
[4867.22 --> 4868.60]  regions for a sec here
[4868.60 --> 4870.06]  I never even had a chance you
[4870.06 --> 4871.08]  didn't even tell me what I
[4871.08 --> 4872.58]  know chance at all what we're
[4872.58 --> 4874.04]  gonna do is a giveaway
[4874.04 --> 4877.42]  if the name is the giveaway
[4877.42 --> 4877.80]  for
[4877.80 --> 4880.00]  just keep drawing until it is
[4880.00 --> 4880.72]  okay
[4880.72 --> 4881.96]  now Luke
[4881.96 --> 4883.86]  I'm sure everybody watching is
[4883.86 --> 4885.72]  gonna be totally cool with that
[4885.72 --> 4887.18]  so what we're gonna be doing is
[4887.18 --> 4888.40]  we're gonna be giving away a
[4888.40 --> 4891.78]  R9 270 X and an OCZ Fatality
[4891.78 --> 4894.18]  1000 watt 80 plus gold power
[4894.18 --> 4896.46]  supply with individually slaved
[4896.46 --> 4898.36]  cables this is for one winner so
[4898.36 --> 4899.86]  one winner is getting both it's a
[4899.86 --> 4901.00]  slightly overpowered power supply
[4901.00 --> 4901.88]  for that graphics card but
[4901.88 --> 4903.34]  whatever don't worry about it
[4903.34 --> 4905.24]  and we're gonna be random.org
[4905.24 --> 4907.00]  drawing that right now so it's
[4907.00 --> 4908.38]  based on a line of tech tips dot
[4908.38 --> 4909.42]  com thread
[4909.42 --> 4911.56]  so just give me one second and I
[4911.56 --> 4913.58]  will pull this up on this monitor
[4913.58 --> 4914.98]  because again my screen sharing is
[4914.98 --> 4917.64]  not working at all so
[4917.64 --> 4919.72]  not learn to come here literally
[4919.72 --> 4922.40]  geez you learn a computer dude I am
[4922.40 --> 4923.80]  come computer right now
[4923.80 --> 4926.94]  it just gets mad at screen sharing
[4926.94 --> 4928.72]  sometimes that's my excuse
[4928.72 --> 4931.88]  sometimes I wonder if exploit was like
[4931.88 --> 4933.40]  written in basic or something because
[4933.40 --> 4935.28]  it's like oh my god is it bloatware
[4935.28 --> 4939.62]  I know I'm not a huge fan of open
[4939.62 --> 4941.60]  broadcaster either though I don't like
[4941.60 --> 4942.88]  the interface I think it works better
[4942.88 --> 4944.80]  overall once you get it configured but
[4944.80 --> 4946.18]  god the whoever wrote the user's or
[4946.18 --> 4947.56]  interface for that thing was like I
[4947.56 --> 4948.32]  don't know I think he might have been
[4948.32 --> 4951.24]  blind I just find that changing
[4951.24 --> 4953.52]  things on the fly with open
[4953.52 --> 4955.80]  broadcaster is a lot harder yeah you
[4955.80 --> 4958.22]  set up everything everything perfectly
[4958.22 --> 4960.70]  beforehand I prefer it but if you have
[4960.70 --> 4962.34]  to mess with things while you're live
[4962.34 --> 4964.50]  exactly prefer it and because we're so
[4964.50 --> 4967.00]  ghetto sauce over here we always have
[4967.00 --> 4968.94]  to mess with things while we're live so
[4968.94 --> 4970.22]  we kind of have to just deal with
[4970.22 --> 4973.26]  exploit yeah I kind of have this
[4973.26 --> 4976.10]  working now is is this logged out it's
[4976.10 --> 4979.68]  logged out perfect okay add screen
[4979.68 --> 4983.66]  region this whole thing give me
[4983.66 --> 4990.66]  inception here for a second
[4990.66 --> 4993.48]  here you do that I'll just entertain
[4993.48 --> 4994.88]  everybody with a little mini
[4994.88 --> 4996.84]  barnacle's dancing we'll just do a little
[4996.84 --> 4997.78]  mini barnacle's dancing
[4997.78 --> 5001.26]  so you guys can see this is the
[5001.26 --> 5002.58]  thread life text isn't chase two cents
[5002.58 --> 5004.70]  giveaway so what we're gonna do is
[5004.70 --> 5007.40]  there's 373 pages so I'm going to
[5007.40 --> 5012.80]  random.org for one out of 373 so right
[5012.80 --> 5016.92]  now we are drawing for the chance to
[5016.92 --> 5018.56]  have a chance to win something
[5018.56 --> 5020.12]  essentially because we're drawing the
[5020.12 --> 5022.56]  page of which we will pick one out of
[5022.56 --> 5026.56]  20 people generate result is page 31
[5026.56 --> 5030.02]  so if I jump ahead one page here
[5030.02 --> 5033.26]  everyone just went to the forum so it's
[5033.26 --> 5035.06]  going super slow and then change the
[5035.06 --> 5038.72]  URL from page dash 2 to page dash 31
[5038.72 --> 5042.16]  that should work just sweet that's the
[5042.16 --> 5046.64]  page I'm on yes awesome is it no okay I
[5046.64 --> 5048.50]  was like what that would have been kind
[5048.50 --> 5051.10]  of dude I'm not entering a contest like

[5054.30 --> 5055.86]  collaborate with jays two cents and we
[5055.86 --> 5057.28]  do tech talk every Thursday that would
[5057.28 --> 5059.22]  that would look really bad if I won I've
[5059.22 --> 5060.94]  hardcore entered contests for other

[5097.06 --> 5102.00]  world warcraft Puget Puget not sure
[5102.00 --> 5110.90]  mr. slayer Chris Rex Mandy I'm probably
[5110.90 --> 5112.16]  butchering every single one of these I'm
[5112.16 --> 5115.54]  I'm Nick that one is pretty easy um
[5115.54 --> 5123.02]  Danny Alice fuzzy tvg viking rob da hood

[5186.76 --> 5189.88]  forum it doesn't actually say how this is
[5189.88 --> 5191.74]  being done so you might want to send him a
[5191.74 --> 5193.78]  message to but I believe he will be
[5193.78 --> 5196.00]  contacting you on the forum with how to
[5196.00 --> 5198.58]  get that all set up so congratulations
[5198.58 --> 5201.58]  snacker and as you guys know which has
[5201.58 --> 5203.62]  been happening with the previous giveaway
[5203.62 --> 5206.52]  that we did for a while if he doesn't
[5206.52 --> 5208.68]  claim his prize we will probably just we
[5208.68 --> 5211.48]  redraw it just give it to me just give it
[5211.48 --> 5214.16]  to me I don't I don't think big Linus is
[5214.16 --> 5218.02]  going to be getting that prize but yeah
[5218.02 --> 5220.02]  we'll just redraw it so don't worry if
[5220.02 --> 5221.88]  the guy has a low post count I think he
[5221.88 --> 5223.60]  only had like four posts or something I
[5223.60 --> 5224.82]  know tons of people freak out about that
[5224.82 --> 5227.24]  every single time it's almost better for
[5227.24 --> 5229.98]  you guys because there might be a second
[5229.98 --> 5232.10]  chance I love how basically everyone in
[5232.10 --> 5233.36]  the twitch chat right now is saying that
[5233.36 --> 5237.32]  they won here I gotta join in there we go
[5237.32 --> 5240.44]  I have to join in on that kind of stuff I
[5240.44 --> 5243.12]  don't know why I just I died you do oh my
[5243.12 --> 5245.48]  god all right is there anything else we
[5245.48 --> 5246.98]  should talk about in here
[5246.98 --> 5250.98]  Sierra's back there was no site is all
[5250.98 --> 5254.56]  ominous now yeah go check this out I
[5254.56 --> 5256.12]  believe it's just Sierra calm or something
[5256.12 --> 5258.56]  that's your interactive anymore just see
[5258.56 --> 5260.56]  oh okay let's see yeah so you're in a
[5260.56 --> 5261.98]  active what used to be one of the great
[5261.98 --> 5266.06]  publishers for PC gaming and just in
[5266.06 --> 5267.76]  general to be completely honest you see
[5267.76 --> 5271.16]  Larry Space Quest oh god they had
[5271.16 --> 5272.94]  awesome games I love Sierra they like
[5272.94 --> 5275.92]  dominated the 80s 90s yeah they've been
[5275.92 --> 5278.84]  dead for a while now but there's been a
[5278.84 --> 5281.44]  teaser post on their website and
[5281.44 --> 5284.30]  Activision is suggesting their return at
[5284.30 --> 5288.30]  Gamescom so we will see people are kind
[5288.30 --> 5289.78]  of wondering what's your game sorry
[5289.78 --> 5292.38]  Sierra game quick favorite all-time
[5292.38 --> 5293.02]  Sierra game
[5293.02 --> 5297.90]  that's such a hard question I know
[5297.90 --> 5298.80]  that's a hard one huh
[5298.80 --> 5304.70]  I'd probably have to see like a proper
[5304.70 --> 5305.22]  list
[5305.22 --> 5308.72]  let me see here Sierra
[5308.72 --> 5316.56]  oh it's still a hard question dude
[5316.56 --> 5318.60]  there's so many games like so many
[5318.60 --> 5322.54]  probably Space Quest I was gonna say
[5322.54 --> 5324.82]  the same thing Space Quest is my all-time
[5324.82 --> 5326.76]  favorite Sierra game the whole series
[5326.76 --> 5329.26]  was hilarious yeah it's still kind of
[5329.26 --> 5331.82]  like I don't know but I'm gonna go with
[5331.82 --> 5333.20]  Space Quest that's what I loved about
[5333.20 --> 5334.90]  Sierra games though is every single one
[5334.90 --> 5336.88]  of them had a really crude funny sense
[5336.88 --> 5338.82]  of humor like full of you and those and
[5338.82 --> 5342.52]  everything it was awesome someone just
[5342.52 --> 5343.28]  said CSGO
[5343.28 --> 5349.40]  I don't think so that's probably about
[5349.40 --> 5351.74]  it we ended pretty much exactly on time
[5351.74 --> 5355.12]  I'm probably going to be having a
[5355.12 --> 5358.42]  after-party thing of my own today but
[5358.42 --> 5360.02]  I don't know when it's gonna start I
[5360.02 --> 5362.84]  got some stuff to do because this week's
[5362.84 --> 5364.48]  nuts I'm probably gonna be streaming
[5364.48 --> 5366.04]  later on in the weekend specifically
[5366.04 --> 5369.76]  Sunday of just me working on projects
[5369.76 --> 5371.70]  because I'm gonna be bored because I'm
[5371.70 --> 5373.10]  working on projects because I have to
[5373.10 --> 5374.72]  work on the weekend because Linus is
[5374.72 --> 5376.80]  taking leave because he has like some
[5376.80 --> 5378.60]  baby or some crap that's supposed to
[5378.60 --> 5380.10]  actually matter I don't know not into
[5380.10 --> 5381.46]  kids hey you know he's not even gonna
[5381.46 --> 5382.84]  do anything he's just gonna he's gonna
[5382.84 --> 5384.04]  sit there and play video games be like
[5384.04 --> 5386.62]  yeah I'm watching the kid and his wife's
[5386.62 --> 5388.74]  gonna be over there like half asleep just
[5388.74 --> 5391.02]  oh my gosh gonna be horrible knowing him
[5391.02 --> 5394.36]  in all seriousness he can't stop moving
[5394.36 --> 5396.76]  for more than like five minutes because
[5396.76 --> 5398.70]  he's this little tiny ball of energy so
[5398.70 --> 5401.72]  so I'm sure he'll be doing a lot it's
[5401.72 --> 5402.88]  not like you can hold the baby because
[5402.88 --> 5404.52]  you can't physically lift that much
[5404.52 --> 5407.64]  weight oh you know what's he gonna do
[5407.64 --> 5409.86]  so you know there's there's been builds
[5409.86 --> 5411.24]  in the past where I'll have to like pick
[5411.24 --> 5412.62]  the computer up and put it on the table
[5412.62 --> 5414.00]  so they could film b-roll of it because
[5414.00 --> 5415.72]  it weighs too much you're basically you're
[5415.72 --> 5417.72]  basically like just hired muscle but
[5417.72 --> 5419.58]  then there's also the opposite when we're
[5419.58 --> 5421.68]  installing soup certain coolers I have
[5421.68 --> 5423.48]  to have him come in and help me like the
[5423.48 --> 5426.24]  Dark Rock Pro 3 that cooler with certain
[5426.24 --> 5428.34]  motherboards is so ridiculous I got called
[5428.34 --> 5430.12]  out for like doing it wrong but like
[5430.12 --> 5432.78]  dude I wasn't doing it wrong if people
[5432.78 --> 5434.64]  saw I don't think we ended up including
[5434.64 --> 5436.62]  this footage how Linus even eventually
[5436.62 --> 5441.74]  was able to do it was holding the my
[5441.74 --> 5444.66]  saying this right not the bolt is the
[5444.66 --> 5446.52]  like screw type thing yeah I've held my
[5446.52 --> 5448.14]  nut before I think you got it right okay
[5448.14 --> 5451.62]  so he's holding it on the side of the
[5451.62 --> 5453.78]  screwdriver bit because the screwdriver was
[5453.78 --> 5456.36]  magnetic so on the side and then he like
[5456.36 --> 5459.18]  hovered it into place and just got it to
[5459.18 --> 5461.38]  thread slightly and then was able to do
[5461.38 --> 5462.82]  it because it was so hard to actually get
[5462.82 --> 5465.78]  in there with your fingers so that's what
[5465.78 --> 5468.18]  we call those expert finaglers yes he was
[5468.18 --> 5470.30]  an expert finagler and he had to help me
[5470.30 --> 5472.08]  with that and that was a complete bullcrap
