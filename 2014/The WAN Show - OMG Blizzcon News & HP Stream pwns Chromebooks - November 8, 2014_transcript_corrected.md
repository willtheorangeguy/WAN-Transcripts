[0.00 → 10.00] Alright guys, welcome to the WAN show, and I'm down a pair of earphones for monitoring so technical difficulties abound.
[10.00 → 15.00] We've got a great show for you guys today though there is a ton of fantastic news.
[15.00 → 26.00] I'm also going to have some early thoughts on the Droid Turbo, which is the phone that I have just started using as of last night, and I'm pretty darn impressed with so far.
[26.00 → 35.00] And of course he's going to talk about Oculus because the Oculus excitement fairies visited in the night and told us that the retail version is coming soon.
[35.00 → 38.00] So let's go through what our main topics for today are.
[38.00 → 44.00] There's of course a ton of news from Blazon and not just like Hearthstone, now with tablets.
[44.00 → 48.00] I mean they have that too, but there's other stuff.
[48.00 → 62.00] Now you can use your Gmail app with any email service including ones like Hotmail who completely lacked apps for years and years and years and years and just generally kind of suck as a mobile experience.
[62.00 → 65.00] Now you can just use the Gmail interface.
[65.00 → 66.00] Woo!
[66.00 → 71.00] Yeah, Google can have your data without even storing anything on their servers now.
[71.00 → 74.00] Like you just skim it and let someone else deal with that problem.
[74.00 → 75.00] That's right.
[75.00 → 76.00] Kalman is bankrupt.
[76.00 → 77.00] Or not.
[77.00 → 78.00] Maybe.
[78.00 → 79.00] Yeah, something's going on.
[79.00 → 85.00] Anyway, and just as like the trustiest steam machine you could ever possibly imagine, get the pun?
[85.00 → 94.00] Anyway, Ubisoft keeps on digging and was able to push through the news of their horribleness through all the mess of Blazon news.
[94.00 → 95.00] Which is a lot.
[95.00 → 96.00] Impressive.
[96.00 → 97.00] And important stuff.
[97.00 → 99.00] I'm not even mad, that's just amazing.
[99.00 → 103.00] It's just like a wow, good work.
[103.00 → 106.00] You are at an impressive level of stuff.
[106.00 → 109.00] That is perfect, good work.
[109.00 → 110.00] Alright, so let's roll the intro here.
[110.00 → 113.00] Let's see if it's set up correctly because I didn't do it.
[113.00 → 115.00] There's sound.
[115.00 → 117.00] Alright, okay.
[117.00 → 122.00] Now, um, shoot I forget which one of it was.
[122.00 → 125.00] One of our sponsors asked very nicely to go first.
[125.00 → 128.00] So it's going to be a 50-50 coin toss at this point because I don't know who it was.
[128.00 → 130.00] I don't know which one.
[130.00 → 134.00] Alright, so our sponsors today are lynda.com.
[134.00 → 142.00] Visit lynda.com slash wan show so that we get credit for referring you to lynda.com, which I guess benefits us somehow.
[142.00 → 143.00] Woo!
[143.00 → 144.00] Woo!
[144.00 → 149.00] And also dollarshaveclub.com, shave time and shave money.
[149.00 → 154.00] You know, we should just do both of the sponsors at the same time from now on.
[154.00 → 159.00] So it should just be like, lynda.com.
[159.00 → 162.00] Yeah, shave your knowledge and expand your beard.
[162.00 → 163.00] Yeah.
[163.00 → 164.00] Wait, what?
[164.00 → 166.00] No, opposite of that.
[166.00 → 167.00] I can't take credit.
[167.00 → 168.00] That was Nick's idea.
[168.00 → 169.00] Oh.
[169.00 → 170.00] Wrong way around.
[170.00 → 172.00] Apparently I got them wrong, but that's okay because I'm not going to concern myself.
[172.00 → 174.00] Expand your knowledge and shave your beard.
[174.00 → 176.00] No, expand your beard, shave your knowledge.
[176.00 → 177.00] We'll do both the same thing.
[177.00 → 179.00] Is that a November thing?
[179.00 → 180.00] Yeah.
[180.00 → 181.00] Expand your beard, shave your knowledge.
[181.00 → 183.00] Yeah, November and like knowledge.
[183.00 → 184.00] Expand your beard, shave your wallet.
[184.00 → 185.00] That's November.
[185.00 → 189.00] Because you have to donate to the November cause, and you have to expand your beard.
[189.00 → 194.00] And you have more to donate to the November cause because Dollar Shave Club saves you money on razors.
[194.00 → 195.00] There you go.
[197.00 → 204.00] Alright, so let's get into our first topic today, which is going to be that Blizzard should just stop making games.
[204.00 → 217.00] Because their cinematic trailers for things, the Warlords of Praetor one, the one for Overwatch that just came out today, that I was like spellbound by.
[217.00 → 219.00] Okay, so I love animated movies.
[219.00 → 220.00] Me too.
[220.00 → 221.00] I love The Incredible.
[221.00 → 223.00] That's one of my favourite movies of all time.
[223.00 → 225.00] I loved Megamind.
[225.00 → 229.00] Like that, action animated movies turns me on.
[229.00 → 230.00] Seriously.
[230.00 → 239.00] So, that trailer today, oh man, I'm glad I was alone in the room because I would have knocked something over with the...
[240.00 → 243.00] Yeah, so, freaking awesome.
[243.00 → 244.00] It's perfect.
[244.00 → 259.00] And, and, they didn't pull that whole BS Square Enix thing where there's like a 16-minute-long cinematic trailer of like some really impressively spiky haired dude with like an impressively huge sword that's also a gun and a laser beam or something.
[259.00 → 262.00] Like twirling around with it or whatever.
[262.00 → 263.00] We didn't get any of that.
[263.00 → 267.00] Or like, you know, dramatic silence broody thing.
[267.00 → 268.00] And then, no gameplay?
[268.00 → 271.00] Because they know we're not going to like it.
[271.00 → 273.00] Uh, no, instead we actually got a gameplay trailer.
[273.00 → 275.00] Do you want to talk about the gameplay trailer for Overwatch?
[275.00 → 282.00] Yeah, so the one thing I really liked about the gameplay trailer for Overwatch, just to completely reiterate what you just said, was that they showed every single character.
[282.00 → 284.00] This is why I love having you as a sidekick.
[284.00 → 287.00] To say exactly what you just said.
[287.00 → 290.00] Um, they showed every single character, which I really appreciated.
[290.00 → 294.00] And they showed, um, what I think was the complete move set.
[294.00 → 295.00] As far as I could tell.
[295.00 → 296.00] Oh!
[296.00 → 301.00] I had to watch it like twice, and I was referencing a sheet that shows like their, their two main moves and their ultimate.
[301.00 → 302.00] Yeah.
[302.00 → 306.00] But if you looked really closely, it looks like they actually show all of their moves, including their ultimate.
[306.00 → 313.00] Now, the, the assassin dude with the dual pistols, pretty much every single time they showed him on screen they showed his ultimate, which was kind of funny.
[313.00 → 319.00] But, I was trying to figure out the first time I watched it, I was like, why does he just get to instant kill everyone around him all the time?
[319.00 → 320.00] Right.
[320.00 → 322.00] I was like, this doesn't seem fair at all.
[322.00 → 325.00] I figured out later on, it's his ultimate thing.
[325.00 → 327.00] They should just call that class, the douchebag.
[327.00 → 328.00] Yeah.
[328.00 → 331.00] Well, he's a stealth character, so it's kind of fun.
[331.00 → 333.00] I know how games work.
[333.00 → 335.00] No, I mean the douchebag comment.
[335.00 → 336.00] Oh.
[336.00 → 337.00] He's a stealth character, so it kind of works.
[337.00 → 338.00] Well, yes, I guess so.
[338.00 → 340.00] At least how I see them when I play games.
[340.00 → 342.00] Anyway, um, it looks perfect.
[342.00 → 343.00] It looks perfect.
[343.00 → 347.00] What a lot of people are pointing out is that while it's like, the first new IP in forever,
[347.00 → 350.00] that's largely because it's, like, it's Titan.
[350.00 → 355.00] They just removed everything except for the PVP portion, and then they were like, yay, whole game.
[355.00 → 359.00] Um, that's, well, that's a like, large amount of speculation.
[359.00 → 360.00] I don't know if that's actually true.
[360.00 → 361.00] Right.
[361.00 → 362.00] That's what a lot of people are saying.
[362.00 → 363.00] And it makes sense.
[363.00 → 366.00] Um, and I don't know if I'm against it.
[366.00 → 370.00] Cause this looks really cool as its own game, and I'm hoping that by being its own game they
[370.00 → 374.00] can expand on it a little bit more instead of having it a canned experience within a larger
[374.00 → 375.00] thing.
[375.00 → 380.00] And, um, even talking to people that are really into WoW since they kind of abandoned the
[380.00 → 385.00] whole Titan idea and brought some of those MMO guys back to the WoW experience.
[385.00 → 386.00] WoW has gotten a lot better because of that.
[386.00 → 388.00] So it kind of makes sense.
[388.00 → 389.00] Right.
[389.00 → 390.00] I'm really stoked for Overwatch, actually.
[390.00 → 391.00] I signed up for the beta already.
[391.00 → 392.00] It looks fun.
[392.00 → 395.00] And I like games that are just kind of, just fun.
[395.00 → 396.00] Yeah.
[396.00 → 397.00] It does.
[397.00 → 398.00] Instead of being super hardcore.
[398.00 → 401.00] It just looks like, well, they're going to have to still work hard to balance it.
[401.00 → 402.00] I'm sure they will.
[402.00 → 407.00] If you're going to compete with something like Team Fortress that's fun and really well-balanced
[407.00 → 411.00] for hardcore as long as you don't go over the top with some of the stupid stuff
[411.00 → 412.00] that goes on.
[412.00 → 413.00] Yeah.
[413.00 → 417.00] Um, if they can achieve both of those things, and Blizzard is one of the companies where I kind
[417.00 → 423.00] of look at it and I go, well, who actually has the pedigree to go head-to-head with Valve
[423.00 → 426.00] as one of the few two competitors in an entire genre?
[426.00 → 429.00] Yeah, I could see them doing it.
[429.00 → 432.00] Balance has never, in my opinion-
[432.00 → 433.00] They're perfect at it!
[433.00 → 435.00] They're perfect at it in some realms.
[435.00 → 436.00] Some ways.
[436.00 → 441.00] Um, I don't personally think they've done very well with World of Warcraft arenas, which
[441.00 → 445.00] is part of the reason why they were actually pushed out of, I can't remember what very large
[445.00 → 447.00] gaming tournament.
[447.00 → 448.00] I can't believe the...
[448.00 → 449.00] ML?
[449.00 → 450.00] Was it?
[450.00 → 453.00] They were pushed out of some huge gaming tournament because they were just like, your thing is
[453.00 → 455.00] horribly unbalanced and this is just ridiculous.
[455.00 → 457.00] Um, so, yeah.
[457.00 → 461.00] But that is a really, that's part of the reason why I said I'm totally okay with it being its
[461.00 → 462.00] own canned experience.
[462.00 → 463.00] Right.
[463.00 → 465.00] Because I don't want the other stuff to mess with it.
[465.00 → 468.00] And if it doesn't mess with it, then they might be able to work on things like Balance
[468.00 → 469.00] much more effectively.
[469.00 → 470.00] Looks like a lot of fun though.
[470.00 → 475.00] So you can sign up for the beta, which is coming in 2015 at PlayOverwatch.com.
[475.00 → 478.00] I'm glad that they're taking their time to polish it.
[478.00 → 479.00] Yep.
[479.00 → 484.00] They're not even doing, I mean, it looks pretty playable right now, but that means that they're-
[484.00 → 486.00] You never, yeah, you never really know some gameplay trailers.
[486.00 → 490.00] So they're probably not working on artwork assets so much anymore.
[490.00 → 495.00] They're probably fine-tuning the actual gameplay and maps and the actual experience of playing
[495.00 → 496.00] the game.
[496.00 → 497.00] So, so I'm really excited to see it.
[497.00 → 498.00] I'm, I want to play with it.
[498.00 → 500.00] I, I like that it's 6v6.
[500.00 → 501.00] Yeah, I think that's pretty cool.
[501.00 → 505.00] It's, it's just pushing it that much more.
[505.00 → 511.00] And if they try to make it competitive 6v6, then I mean, there's a lot more room for dynamic
[511.00 → 514.00] gameplay, especially as you throw in all of these different classes.
[514.00 → 515.00] Yeah, there's a ton.
[515.00 → 518.00] I don't know the exact number, but there's a really large amount.
[518.00 → 519.00] Yeah, so it's like-
[519.00 → 522.00] And they're, they're pushing the whole, it's a character instead of it being a class,
[522.00 → 523.00] but it's, it's a class.
[523.00 → 524.00] Oh, whatever.
[524.00 → 525.00] Yeah, it's a class.
[525.00 → 529.00] There's the sniper and there's the engineer and there's the tank guy and it, yeah.
[529.00 → 531.00] But the engineer has a beard now!
[531.00 → 532.00] Not surprising!
[532.00 → 533.00] Yeah.
[533.00 → 535.00] Anyway, moving on.
[535.00 → 536.00] Okay.
[536.00 → 538.00] Should we just do all the Blizzard news right now?
[538.00 → 539.00] Yeah, sure, sure.
[539.00 → 542.00] So, so yeah, I, just one last thing.
[542.00 → 544.00] We finally got an FPS from Blizzard.
[544.00 → 546.00] We've been waiting for it since Ghost!
[546.00 → 547.00] Yay!
[547.00 → 549.00] I still wish we got Ghost!
[549.00 → 551.00] And back to the Star Craft universe!
[551.00 → 552.00] Now you can do your thing.
[552.00 → 558.00] Okay, so, so Legacy of the Void will be a standalone game, which is interesting, and I personally think actually a perfect idea.
[558.00 → 561.00] Uh, because it'll make the barrier of entry into Star Craft a lot easier.
[561.00 → 567.00] Um, because buying a new game and then having to buy the two new expansions.
[567.00 → 568.00] All these expansions for it.
[568.00 → 573.00] Like the 90, the 90 or $100 battle chest that inevitably comes out.
[573.00 → 574.00] Yeah.
[574.00 → 575.00] That's just really frustrating.
[575.00 → 578.00] So I'm really cool with the fact that they made it a standalone game.
[578.00 → 580.00] They're doing a few cool things as well.
[580.00 → 587.00] Uh, I'm not really going to focus tons on like the you get to pilot this ancient ship and the single player and all that crap.
[587.00 → 590.00] And there was like a lot of lore around it, and it's like really cool.
[590.00 → 594.00] Certain things happened if you like single player Star Craft campaigns, go play it.
[594.00 → 596.00] I do, but I don't think a ton of people care.
[596.00 → 597.00] So, oh well.
[597.00 → 599.00] Um, they're introducing a few new modes.
[599.00 → 601.00] Uh, one that looks fascinating is Archon mode.
[601.00 → 607.00] A new co-op and PVP mode where you work with your teammate to control a single base and a single army.
[607.00 → 611.00] So you're, you're, it's two people controlling one team essentially.
[611.00 → 612.00] That sounds like a lot of fun.
[612.00 → 614.00] I actually think so as well.
[614.00 → 615.00] Again, I'm really stoked.
[615.00 → 624.00] For people who are new to the game, that kind of thing could be a legitimately entertaining way to play in a game with your buddy who's like way better.
[624.00 → 627.00] I've forced it before because I love this idea.
[627.00 → 632.00] I've gone into a 2v2 and essentially like we've, we've rushed and essentially sacrificed one of our guys.
[632.00 → 633.00] Right.
[633.00 → 635.00] And then just given control to the other guy.
[635.00 → 636.00] Right.
[636.00 → 638.00] And then one person manages the base and the other person manages the army.
[638.00 → 645.00] And by being able to quite literally be in two places at once, it can make two players that would be fairly mediocre into,
[645.00 → 646.00] like, actually a perfect player.
[646.00 → 647.00] A super player.
[647.00 → 648.00] Right.
[648.00 → 649.00] Yeah.
[649.00 → 650.00] And it's, it's interesting to see how that plays out.
[650.00 → 652.00] So it's really cool that it's actually a game mode now.
[652.00 → 653.00] Yeah.
[653.00 → 654.00] I'm going to have a lot of fun with that, actually.
[654.00 → 655.00] Yeah.
[655.00 → 656.00] I will, I will play that game mode.
[656.00 → 660.00] It's probably the only thing I'll care about because I like RTS games.
[660.00 → 665.00] I enjoy them, but I tend to be a little bit of a scatterbrain and a little bit kind of ADD.
[665.00 → 674.00] So I will completely forget about that, you know, 16 units that I queued up, and I'll be in a skirmish or whatever and I left 16 guys standing next to my barracks.
[674.00 → 680.00] And if you could have just, just have someone just like pushing units at you while you fight, and you just get completely fight, that'd be fun.
[680.00 → 682.00] And I'm a base micromanager.
[682.00 → 683.00] I like building bases.
[683.00 → 684.00] Right.
[684.00 → 688.00] And I usually just like attacking when I have like a huge army, which isn't necessarily always the best way to go.
[688.00 → 690.00] That's not really necessarily a good strategy.
[690.00 → 691.00] No, yeah.
[691.00 → 704.00] And then they have another mode called Allied Commanders, which is another co-op style mode where players join forces through different scenarios, and they gain new capabilities as they progress and go forward.
[704.00 → 709.00] And I don't know a ton about that one, but again, it's this like bringing people together.
[709.00 → 710.00] I like RTSs a lot.
[710.00 → 712.00] I like watching 1v1 Star Craft.
[712.00 → 714.00] I'm not a huge fan of playing 1v1 Star Craft.
[714.00 → 716.00] I like playing RTSs on teams.
[716.00 → 721.00] My favourite modes are 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 because I get to play with someone.
[721.00 → 724.00] So I like that they're bringing out these additional modes.
[724.00 → 739.00] Also, there's going to be a like online dynamic tournament system, which should be really cool, which I'm pretty stoked about because people like my brother, Colds, a Star Craft caster, have been pretty frustrated with the like tournament support and team support in Star Craft.
[739.00 → 742.00] So it's cool that they might actually be doing something about it.
[742.00 → 745.00] Also, they're bringing in new units, which is not surprising.
[745.00 → 748.00] And they're bringing back the Lurker, which some people have been waiting for.
[748.00 → 757.00] Alright, so then we did promise that one of the things at Blazon was going to be Hearthstone with tablets, just like last year.
[757.00 → 760.00] Well, now it's Hearthstone on different tablets.
[760.00 → 762.00] Android tablets.
[764.00 → 765.00] Asshole, there's another one.
[765.00 → 771.00] Why wasn't this a thing nine months ago, shortly after the iOS release? I don't know.
[771.00 → 777.00] Should have been a lot faster. I'm pretty stoked that it's finally happening, but it's more of a like, yeah, okay.
[777.00 → 780.00] Thank you. Instead of like a yay!
[780.00 → 784.00] But they're also releasing a new expansion, Goblins vs. Gnomes.
[784.00 → 787.00] So that'll be cool. The previous expansion that they released was actually really fun.
[787.00 → 792.00] So it's cool to see them expanding the game. There's also going to be 120 new themed cards, which is pretty insane.
[792.00 → 794.00] Hey, and you don't have to borrow my iPad anymore.
[794.00 → 795.00] Yeah.
[795.00 → 796.00] Hey, that worked out for everyone.
[796.00 → 800.00] Alright, so let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.
[800.00 → 803.00] Intel was caught cheating.
[803.00 → 805.00] Now is this the second time?
[805.00 → 808.00] Oh, this is... I think it's more than that.
[808.00 → 809.00] Or like the whatever time? Yeah, yeah.
[809.00 → 811.00] Because when I first saw the story, I was like, wait.
[811.00 → 812.00] Okay, there was...
[812.00 → 813.00] Is this an old article?
[813.00 → 829.00] There was like the big one where there was like allegedly Intel was, you know, paying for people to not or deeply incentivizing their partners to not carry AMD products.
[829.00 → 833.00] And that was, I think that was like HP and Dell or something like that.
[833.00 → 835.00] And this was back around the same timeframe.
[835.00 → 837.00] I think a little bit earlier, actually.
[837.00 → 838.00] Okay.
[838.00 → 840.00] Whereas this is during the Pentium 4 days.
[840.00 → 849.00] Specifically, if you bought a Pentium 4 based computer sometime between November 20th in the year 2000 and December 31st, 2001.
[849.00 → 851.00] So just over a year of time.
[851.00 → 852.00] You bought a P4.
[852.00 → 856.00] You get a $15 cash payout for Intel...
[856.00 → 857.00] Not allegedly.
[857.00 → 858.00] It's confirmed now.
[858.00 → 859.00] They were caught.
[859.00 → 866.00] So for Intel misrepresenting the performance of the Pentium 4 relative to the AMD Athlon Thunderbird.
[866.00 → 871.00] So if you want your $15 bucks, there's no receipt necessary.
[871.00 → 877.00] And Intel will also be paying $4 million to educational charities, which is pretty cool.
[877.00 → 878.00] They have to pay.
[878.00 → 879.00] They're not also paying.
[879.00 → 880.00] They're not like, yeah.
[880.00 → 883.00] Thank you for the unfavourable court ruling.
[883.00 → 884.00] Just to...
[884.00 → 886.00] Here's $4 million bucks.
[886.00 → 887.00] No, it's something.
[887.00 → 888.00] They have to do that.
[888.00 → 895.00] Yeah, so it's one of those things where I think a lot of people will kind of look at this and go, you know, big bad Intel, you're bad dudes.
[895.00 → 896.00] And you know what?
[896.00 → 897.00] That was not a cool thing to do.
[897.00 → 905.00] I think that based on our engagement with Intel over the last couple of years, they treat this kind of stuff really seriously internally now.
[905.00 → 909.00] Especially after that, the big lawsuit, the one where they had to pay AMD.
[909.00 → 911.00] Like, I can't remember how much it was.
[911.00 → 915.00] I want to say it was in the neighbourhood of hundreds of millions or a billion or something like that.
[915.00 → 916.00] Yeah, it was a big deal.
[916.00 → 918.00] So, ever since...
[918.00 → 919.00] Yeah, I vaguely remember that.
[919.00 → 928.00] Ever since that whole thing came to light, like, they are so careful when they talk to us about, look, say whatever you want.
[928.00 → 929.00] Do this.
[929.00 → 930.00] Do that.
[930.00 → 933.00] Criticize us publicly if that's what it comes to.
[933.00 → 934.00] Just be fair.
[934.00 → 936.00] And, like, we'll sponsor you.
[936.00 → 937.00] We'll have that relationship with you.
[937.00 → 939.00] But we can't affect anything you do or say.
[939.00 → 940.00] I'm like, okay.
[940.00 → 941.00] But that's good.
[941.00 → 942.00] That's how it's supposed to work.
[942.00 → 943.00] So...
[943.00 → 944.00] Yeah, they've been, yeah.
[944.00 → 947.00] They're always pretty, pretty careful now.
[947.00 → 948.00] No.
[948.00 → 949.00] No.
[949.00 → 950.00] No.
[950.00 → 953.00] I think the computer from, like, high school wasn't fast enough, so I want my $15 now.
[953.00 → 954.00] I want my lunch money.
[954.00 → 962.00] You know, the only winners from something like this, because the amount of effort that it takes to make the $15, you could probably go fill out online surveys and make $15.
[962.00 → 964.00] The only winners are people that are like...
[964.00 → 965.00] Lawyers.
[965.00 → 966.00] Yeah, well, lawyers.
[966.00 → 972.00] And then people that are like 14 and then are like, Dad, can I say that you bought a computer at this time?
[972.00 → 974.00] Dad's like, sure, whatever.
[974.00 → 977.00] And then that kid gets $15 and then buys a cheap game on Steam.
[977.00 → 978.00] Yay!
[978.00 → 982.00] Yeah, so the lawyers are the big winners, but that's about it.
[982.00 → 984.00] And an educational charity.
[984.00 → 985.00] Yeah, and a charity.
[985.00 → 991.00] Speaking of being a big winner, Sony reports a $1.25 billion loss.
[991.00 → 992.00] Did I say winner?
[992.00 → 994.00] Because I meant loser.
[994.00 → 996.00] Over the last quarter.
[996.00 → 998.00] $1.25 billion US dollars.
[998.00 → 999.00] Spearheaded, so...
[999.00 → 1000.00] Oh, wow.
[1000.00 → 1002.00] We haven't been posting original posters.
[1002.00 → 1003.00] Oh, jeez.
[1003.00 → 1004.00] Oh, no.
[1004.00 → 1009.00] So, Intel caught cheating was tizzy, and the original article was from gizmodo.com.
[1009.00 → 1013.00] And this one was posted by Goodbyes, and the original article is from neowind.net.
[1013.00 → 1014.00] Not done.
[1014.00 → 1022.00] The Hearthstone on Tablets post was by Johannes, and the Overwatch post was by Buffalo.
[1022.00 → 1024.00] I need this adapter.
[1024.00 → 1028.00] As long as this isn't the one that I marked dead, and should just throw away because it
[1028.00 → 1029.00] doesn't work.
[1029.00 → 1030.00] Yeah, but what...
[1030.00 → 1031.00] Oh, no.
[1031.00 → 1032.00] This is the good one.
[1032.00 → 1035.00] What I normally do is if it's dead, I cut it in half, and then I just throw it away.
[1035.00 → 1036.00] So people don't take it out of the garbage.
[1036.00 → 1040.00] Yeah, I actually had a problem with people fishing the stuff that I had thrown away out
[1040.00 → 1041.00] of the garbage.
[1041.00 → 1043.00] I think an Ethernet cable made the rounds like four times.
[1043.00 → 1044.00] Yeah.
[1044.00 → 1047.00] It's like, I'm just trying to network things.
[1047.00 → 1049.00] I want them to just work.
[1049.00 → 1054.00] Okay, so Linus's screen sharing is evidently not a thing right now.
[1054.00 → 1055.00] Windows PE.
[1055.00 → 1056.00] So, yeah.
[1056.00 → 1059.00] No, Linus is not screen sharing today.
[1059.00 → 1060.00] Okay, so from Neowind.
[1060.00 → 1067.00] Sony reports $1.25 billion in losses led by Wright, mostly due to their mobile division,
[1067.00 → 1072.00] which is a real shame because I don't know about necessarily the rest of their line-up,
[1072.00 → 1078.00] but the Peria Z2 is a really solid phone, and it doesn't get the amount of attention that
[1078.00 → 1079.00] I really think it deserves.
[1079.00 → 1086.00] I mean, they were one of the first ones to glom onto that idea that, oh, wow, we should
[1086.00 → 1088.00] make the battery bigger.
[1088.00 → 1092.00] I mean, it's got a 3200 William hour battery, which is significantly more than most of its
[1092.00 → 1093.00] competition.
[1093.00 → 1095.00] And they were the first ones to pioneer that whole waterproof thing.
[1095.00 → 1098.00] Remember how much our brains exploded at CES?
[1098.00 → 1099.00] That was pretty awesome.
[1099.00 → 1100.00] Yeah.
[1100.00 → 1101.00] When they had like the dunk tank with the phone?
[1101.00 → 1102.00] Yeah, yeah.
[1102.00 → 1103.00] That was actually pretty cool.
[1103.00 → 1110.00] If they had a stock Android skin instead of their Sony skin, I probably would have bought
[1110.00 → 1112.00] a Z3 by now because I'm up for an upgrade.
[1112.00 → 1117.00] So, okay, I would have upgraded through my phone plan to a Z3.
[1117.00 → 1121.00] So their movie division had an operating loss of $10 million, which in the grand scheme
[1121.00 → 1124.00] of things is actually not that bad.
[1124.00 → 1130.00] You know, they could have sold a couple more tickets to something, and it's kind of a you
[1130.00 → 1132.00] kind of look at that, and you go, okay, well maybe it'll be better next quarter.
[1132.00 → 1133.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1133.00 → 1135.00] You know, Hollywood accounting and all that kind of stuff.
[1135.00 → 1136.00] Yep.
[1136.00 → 1142.00] And so, you know, revenues increased in total 7%, although I personally, as much as investors
[1142.00 → 1146.00] might care about this kind of thing, like Wall Street kind of cares about this, I kind
[1146.00 → 1149.00] of look at it and I go, so what, you sold more, but you lost more money?
[1149.00 → 1151.00] How is that a business strategy?
[1151.00 → 1152.00] That's not a good sign.
[1152.00 → 1158.00] That just means you slashed your prices to liquidate and then you, like, on a very sort
[1158.00 → 1161.00] of micro level, obviously they're doing it on a much larger scale.
[1161.00 → 1162.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1162.00 → 1164.00] Slashing things and liquidating.
[1164.00 → 1169.00] And then their music division posted slight profits and PlayStation 4 maintained healthy
[1169.00 → 1178.00] sales, although I really have to wonder with the way AAA gaming is going, is PlayStation
[1178.00 → 1182.00] 4 a worthy competitor to the Wii U right now?
[1182.00 → 1184.00] Oh, Wii U is smashing it so far.
[1184.00 → 1185.00] And like with-
[1185.00 → 1186.00] Get it, smashing it?
[1186.00 → 1188.00] That was actually the point, yeah.
[1188.00 → 1189.00] Sorry.
[1189.00 → 1190.00] Yeah.
[1190.00 → 1191.00] Boom.
[1191.00 → 1192.00] Um.
[1192.00 → 1193.00] Fist smash!
[1193.00 → 1194.00] Smash stick!
[1194.00 → 1198.00] Anyway, they're doing really well and with Smash around the corner and with, uh, what
[1198.00 → 1199.00] is it called?
[1199.00 → 1201.00] Squid, Squadron or, I can't remember the name of the game.
[1201.00 → 1202.00] Uh, Platoon!
[1202.00 → 1203.00] There we go.
[1203.00 → 1206.00] With that around the corner getting really, perfect reviews.
[1206.00 → 1209.00] The Wii U has just been doing incredibly well lately.
[1209.00 → 1213.00] And, uh, like something that I thought was amazing, which I tweeted out not that long
[1213.00 → 1219.00] ago, was a bunch of Xbox and PlayStation, like that style of next gen console fanboys
[1219.00 → 1223.00] ragging on Wii U before Xbox One and PS4 had been released.
[1223.00 → 1224.00] Right.
[1224.00 → 1227.00] Like, you think it's cool that you can run like 1080p 60fps?
[1227.00 → 1228.00] That's pathetic!
[1228.00 → 1229.00] Oh yeah!
[1229.00 → 1234.00] I get a kick out of how many console fanboys still think that they're getting 4K at some
[1234.00 → 1235.00] point.
[1235.00 → 1237.00] No you aren't!
[1237.00 → 1238.00] No dude, no.
[1238.00 → 1241.00] Um, I don't, I don't know, I think it still will.
[1241.00 → 1247.00] Um, because no matter how much I can go, like, yeah, the best setup is a Wii U and a
[1247.00 → 1251.00] PC, or if you just have like little kids, maybe just a Wii U or something.
[1251.00 → 1255.00] Um, because I'm a huge fan of Wii U, and I'm a huge fan of PC gaming.
[1255.00 → 1262.00] It's, it's, it's in this weird situation where, uh, like, kind of like with World of
[1262.00 → 1265.00] Warcraft in a lot of ways, you want to play a game that all your friends are playing.
[1265.00 → 1266.00] Yeah.
[1266.00 → 1268.00] That's one of the big reasons why World of Warcraft exploded.
[1268.00 → 1269.00] Yeah.
[1269.00 → 1272.00] It's because if people wanted to play a game with a lot of their friends, it just catalyzed
[1272.00 → 1275.00] so quickly because so many people started playing, and it just blew up.
[1275.00 → 1277.00] And that happens with consoles as well.
[1277.00 → 1281.00] I remember being in high school, I wanted to play games with my friends.
[1281.00 → 1286.00] Every single friend that I had was playing on consoles and then there's like me with my computer.
[1286.00 → 1287.00] I'm like, yay.
[1287.00 → 1288.00] Okay.
[1288.00 → 1290.00] Hey guys, do you want to get together and play some games?
[1290.00 → 1293.00] Um, where do I plug in my mouse and keyboard?
[1293.00 → 1295.00] They're like, what?
[1295.00 → 1298.00] Eventually I was able to like to move everyone over onto my team.
[1298.00 → 1300.00] But, um, yeah, there was a lot of console playing.
[1300.00 → 1301.00] I had an Xbox.
[1301.00 → 1302.00] I played Halo 2 online.
[1302.00 → 1305.00] It was actually fantastic because Halo 2 was an amazing game.
[1305.00 → 1306.00] Really?
[1306.00 → 1310.00] So you didn't like to catch the leprosy or something?
[1310.00 → 1311.00] Console leprosy?
[1311.00 → 1312.00] After Halo 2 I ditched hard.
[1312.00 → 1315.00] I bought Halo 3, and I was like, wow, this game's terrible.
[1315.00 → 1318.00] And then I stopped.
[1318.00 → 1322.00] Um, but yeah, by that point I had moved a lot of my friends to PC gaming anyway.
[1322.00 → 1324.00] So it just kind of worked out.
[1324.00 → 1325.00] But like, I get it.
[1325.00 → 1327.00] I understand why so many people are into it.
[1327.00 → 1332.00] Um, I think it's actually, I'm part of that like PC Master Race group where it's like,
[1332.00 → 1334.00] I actually feel bad for them.
[1334.00 → 1336.00] Like I wish their experience was better.
[1336.00 → 1337.00] Wow.
[1337.00 → 1338.00] Their consoles just suck.
[1338.00 → 1341.00] But no, if you look back at it, most console releases, they lose money when they sell the
[1341.00 → 1342.00] machine.
[1342.00 → 1344.00] And then they make money back on games and controllers and stuff.
[1344.00 → 1347.00] Now they're making money from selling the machine because it's a giant piece of crap.
[1347.00 → 1349.00] Well it's not very large.
[1349.00 → 1351.00] Like I wish they had, well it's a small piece of crap.
[1351.00 → 1353.00] It's a very slim lined piece of crap.
[1353.00 → 1354.00] It doesn't smell bad.
[1354.00 → 1355.00] It could.
[1355.00 → 1357.00] So it's, it could, yes.
[1357.00 → 1358.00] It smells, it's not static.
[1358.00 → 1361.00] Anyway, um, yeah, I wish they had a better experience.
[1361.00 → 1362.00] They just don't.
[1362.00 → 1363.00] Okay.
[1363.00 → 1365.00] You know what's kind of funny?
[1365.00 → 1370.00] We have surprisingly few live viewers today, and I'm not quite sure what's going on.
[1370.00 → 1374.00] Ah yes, the announcement video on YouTube never went live for some reason.
[1374.00 → 1376.00] It's sitting right here.
[1376.00 → 1378.00] Oh, invalid request.
[1378.00 → 1379.00] Authentication expired.
[1379.00 → 1380.00] Well that's clever.
[1380.00 → 1385.00] Let's go ahead and actually announce that we're live because that would be fantastic.
[1385.00 → 1389.00] That's the kind of thing that you should do if you're live and streaming a video.
[1389.00 → 1390.00] You should be like, to dog, I'm live.
[1390.00 → 1392.00] You all should come watch right about now.
[1392.00 → 1396.00] It's going to be pretty cool and awesome, and I can't believe we didn't do this.
[1396.00 → 1400.00] I sort of suspected something earlier, but then I got all carried away ranting about something
[1400.00 → 1402.00] and then I got distracted.
[1402.00 → 1406.00] Speaking of ranting about things and getting distracted, HTC's new charger gets your mobile
[1406.00 → 1409.00] charging up to 40% faster.
[1409.00 → 1414.00] So it takes advantage, this is not an HTC technology, it takes advantage of Qualcomm's Quick Charge
[1414.00 → 1415.00] 2.0 technology.
[1415.00 → 1426.00] So the 1M8, 1E8, 1M8 HK edition, Harman Kardon edition, ooh it's very special, and the Desire Eye can all utilize this new charger.
[1426.00 → 1434.00] So they figure the certified charger can restore 60% to a 3300 William hour battery in just 30 minutes.
[1434.00 → 1436.00] That's awesome. I like that it's backwards compatible.
[1436.00 → 1449.00] It's called the HTC Rapid Charger 2.0, and it not only works with the newer devices that support Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, but also older devices that support Quick Charge 1.0, albeit at a lesser rate.
[1449.00 → 1460.00] So I've actually got at least, you know what, I'm pretty sure the Droid Turbo has a Quick Charge 2.0, but I also have a 1M8 so we have a Quick Charger on order already.
[1460.00 → 1462.00] Not from HTC, it's a different one.
[1462.00 → 1463.00] Yeah.
[1463.00 → 1479.00] That I'm going to try out, I'm going to see how much of a difference it makes, because I think that even though we haven't gotten to that revolutionary stage yet, where we can charge our batteries in 15 seconds wirelessly, or we have batteries that last for five days at a time or whatever else.
[1479.00 → 1480.00] That's what I'm hoping for.
[1480.00 → 1481.00] That's what I'm hoping for.
[1481.00 → 1499.00] If I can recharge in half an hour to an hour, let's say, and I can get a full day no matter how hard I abuse it out of the capacity of that battery, then that's at least a massive step towards that revolutionary next step.
[1499.00 → 1506.00] The really cool part, in my opinion, about this, like, you can get 60% in half an hour, isn't even the half an hour part.
[1506.00 → 1511.00] It's how much that comes down to in like a two minute or five minute frame.
[1511.00 → 1512.00] Yeah.
[1512.00 → 1514.00] The burst, like, oh my god, I need a little battery, but I can't stop.
[1514.00 → 1517.00] I have seven minutes and nine seconds before I need to walk out the door.
[1517.00 → 1518.00] Yes, yeah.
[1518.00 → 1519.00] My phone is almost dead.
[1519.00 → 1524.00] Can I get through this date that's probably going to be horrible by texting on my phone the whole time?
[1524.00 → 1526.00] If it dies, what am I going to do?
[1526.00 → 1529.00] I'm going to have to actually look at her face, which is horrible.
[1529.00 → 1530.00] Like that kind of thing, right?
[1530.00 → 1531.00] Yeah.
[1531.00 → 1533.00] That would be really helpful.
[1533.00 → 1539.00] I don't, a lot of times, if it's going to be able to sit there for half an hour, it's going to be able to sit there for three hours.
[1539.00 → 1541.00] It's going to be able to sit there for more than that.
[1541.00 → 1544.00] It's the very short burst charging that excites.
[1544.00 → 1551.00] So I'm going to use this to segue into my initial thoughts about the Droid Turbo from Motorola.
[1551.00 → 1556.00] This is a Verizon exclusive device, and honestly, that's the biggest complaint I can come up with about it,
[1556.00 → 1561.00] is that not everyone everywhere right now can buy it.
[1561.00 → 1563.00] It's very early stages.
[1563.00 → 1571.00] I first signed in to my Google account on it 21 hours ago, so I've been using it for very little time, but...
[1571.00 → 1574.00] Is it Verizon exclusive for the world?
[1574.00 → 1575.00] No.
[1575.00 → 1576.00] Is it Verizon coming to Canada?
[1576.00 → 1582.00] No, I think it's going to be, there are rumors that it'll be called the Droid Max, or the Motor Max, or something like that.
[1582.00 → 1583.00] So it'll have a different name.
[1583.00 → 1586.00] Yeah, so it'll have a different name or whatever, but it'll probably be a very similar phone.
[1586.00 → 1587.00] Yeah.
[1587.00 → 1591.00] What's cool about it is, and this is a review unit, so I'm not sure if this will apply to the retail ones,
[1591.00 → 1599.00] but the Verizon-ness of it is that I can't use MMS. Verizon doesn't allow MMS messages outside their own network,
[1599.00 → 1600.00] and that's pretty locked.
[1600.00 → 1606.00] Even after I rooted my wife's Droid DNA, she never got MMS working.
[1606.00 → 1608.00] So there's that.
[1608.00 → 1612.00] Limitation number two is that it comes with some Verizon stuff pre-installed on it
[1612.00 → 1615.00] that you can go make a folder for somewhere and hide it.
[1615.00 → 1620.00] And then limitation number three is that when you first put in your SIM, it boots up and says,
[1620.00 → 1622.00] blah, blah, blah, this is not a Verizon SIM.
[1622.00 → 1625.00] And then you press OK, and it drops you on the home screen.
[1625.00 → 1626.00] Nice.
[1626.00 → 1631.00] So it doesn't, so what I'm hoping is everyone will be able to buy one,
[1631.00 → 1634.00] even if they can't necessarily get one with a carrier subsidy,
[1634.00 → 1639.00] because the 3900 William hour battery in here, they're claiming two days,
[1639.00 → 1643.00] that's Motorola's sort of quote, is we want you to get through 48 hours per charge,
[1643.00 → 1646.00] and I'm going to go, you know what, phone enthusiasts?
[1646.00 → 1647.00] Yeah, it ain't happening.
[1647.00 → 1648.00] It's not going to be two days.
[1648.00 → 1655.00] Unless you were already getting one and two thirds of a day out of a Peria Z2,
[1655.00 → 1658.00] you're not going to get two days out of this, because it's like that much more.
[1658.00 → 1665.00] But what I want from it, and what it looks like I'm going to get, is like one tank day.
[1665.00 → 1667.00] Like no matter what I do to it.
[1667.00 → 1670.00] So today, I am hitting it as hard as I can.
[1670.00 → 1676.00] Like I used my GPS navigation to go to work and back, so that was a total of an hour today already.
[1676.00 → 1678.00] No, more than that. About an hour and a half.
[1678.00 → 1685.00] That used to kill, my phone used to die from full to zero completely on one of that trip.
[1685.00 → 1687.00] One direction of that trip that you just pulled.
[1687.00 → 1692.00] So I've had music running all day, I've had the screen brightness just kind of managing itself
[1692.00 → 1694.00] rather than doing anything special with it.
[1694.00 → 1698.00] I've had Bluetooth on, I've had everything on, and I've been constantly on it.
[1698.00 → 1703.00] I've been doing all my emails and all my prep for WAN show I did on here instead of on my computer.
[1703.00 → 1709.00] And I'm still at 37%, and I'm tethering to my laptop throughout the entire WAN show.
[1709.00 → 1712.00] Like I'm trying to throw a worst case scenario at it, and if it can make it through this day.
[1712.00 → 1714.00] And he's leaving the screen on this whole time.
[1714.00 → 1716.00] Yeah, with even... like I'm hurting it.
[1716.00 → 1717.00] He's destroying it.
[1717.00 → 1722.00] If it can make it through this day with 5% left, with all my apps and all my services running in the background,
[1722.00 → 1727.00] including the Moto 360 connectedness, I'm going to be really impressed.
[1727.00 → 1729.00] And this is going to be my new daily driver for sure.
[1729.00 → 1730.00] Yeah.
[1730.00 → 1734.00] So there you go, that's my initial thoughts. Full review to come though, of course.
[1734.00 → 1737.00] People are asking about full room water cooling.
[1737.00 → 1738.00] It'll come.
[1738.00 → 1739.00] It'll come.
[1739.00 → 1741.00] I have a post in the water cooling section about it.
[1741.00 → 1742.00] It'll be on the way.
[1742.00 → 1744.00] And then mineral oil, we have like a...
[1744.00 → 1745.00] Monday night.
[1745.00 → 1746.00] Monday night.
[1746.00 → 1747.00] Okay.
[1747.00 → 1748.00] Monday night.
[1748.00 → 1749.00] It's on the schedule.
[1749.00 → 1750.00] It's actually edited now.
[1750.00 → 1751.00] Perfect.
[1751.00 → 1752.00] There you go.
[1752.00 → 1753.00] Yeah, I thought we had a date.
[1753.00 → 1754.00] I wasn't sure, so I didn't want to say it.
[1754.00 → 1755.00] So yeah, Monday night, mineral oil is coming.
[1755.00 → 1760.00] Tell you what, tomorrow is the Sennheiser Momentum in-ear earphones.
[1760.00 → 1761.00] Tomorrow night.
[1761.00 → 1765.00] The following night is LG's Curved Surround Part 1.
[1765.00 → 1766.00] That'll be cool.
[1766.00 → 1768.00] And then the night after that is Oil-Cooled Part 2.
[1768.00 → 1769.00] Which should also be really cool.
[1769.00 → 1773.00] So it's all going to be perfect stuff for the next few days.
[1773.00 → 1774.00] I haven't even seen Oil-Cooled Part 2.
[1774.00 → 1775.00] I'm excited.
[1775.00 → 1777.00] I watched number one, and I was like, wow, that was really cool.
[1777.00 → 1779.00] And I was like, wait a second, I was in that.
[1779.00 → 1780.00] Yeah, I was there.
[1780.00 → 1781.00] Yay!
[1781.00 → 1785.00] Yeah, Burke got it down to 13 minutes.
[1785.00 → 1786.00] Nice.
[1786.00 → 1787.00] Yeah, so it's pretty...
[1787.00 → 1788.00] Like three hours of footage or something?
[1788.00 → 1789.00] It's pretty compact.
[1789.00 → 1790.00] Yeah.
[1790.00 → 1792.00] Alright, so speaking of things that are going to be good.
[1792.00 → 1793.00] Oh my goodness.
[1793.00 → 1795.00] This is freaking awesome.
[1795.00 → 1796.00] Oh yeah.
[1796.00 → 1800.00] Now you can use your Gmail app with other email accounts.
[1800.00 → 1805.00] Like, I don't know about you guys, but I still have a Hotmail.com account that is tied
[1805.00 → 1820.00] that is tied to so many things that it's just way more work than it's worth because, you know, some site will like to change their domain and send me a notification about it at some point, and I'll have like something or something.
[1820.00 → 1822.00] And it'll go to that email address.
[1822.00 → 1827.00] But I hate the Hotmail interface or Outlook or whatever it is they call it these days.
[1827.00 → 1828.00] Yeah.
[1828.00 → 1829.00] Absolutely hate it.
[1829.00 → 1830.00] Being able to...
[1830.00 → 1831.00] Especially the mobile one.
[1831.00 → 1832.00] Yes, especially the mobile one.
[1832.00 → 1835.00] Being able to use my Gmail app for that.
[1835.00 → 1836.00] Yeah.
[1836.00 → 1839.00] Which means hopefully eventually inbox?
[1839.00 → 1840.00] Maybe.
[1840.00 → 1841.00] Maybe.
[1841.00 → 1842.00] This isn't inbox.
[1842.00 → 1843.00] No.
[1843.00 → 1844.00] We have to be very clear about that.
[1844.00 → 1847.00] New Gmail app, which I actually just started using.
[1847.00 → 1848.00] It just rolled out to me.
[1848.00 → 1849.00] I updated to it.
[1849.00 → 1851.00] Has a very different look and feel to it.
[1851.00 → 1853.00] It has that, what are they calling it?
[1853.00 → 1854.00] Material design?
[1854.00 → 1855.00] Yes, I think so.
[1855.00 → 1857.00] Material design kind of look to it, which is just...
[1857.00 → 1858.00] I don't care.
[1858.00 → 1860.00] Everything's kind of in the same place.
[1860.00 → 1861.00] Some stuff's round now.
[1861.00 → 1862.00] It's like, okay.
[1862.00 → 1864.00] Yay, curved edges.
[1864.00 → 1865.00] So there's that.
[1865.00 → 1872.00] It's going to match better with the upcoming Android Lollipop.
[1872.00 → 1880.00] But the new Gmail is completely separate from inbox, which I got an invitation from someone, and thank you so much for that.
[1880.00 → 1886.00] But it hasn't been very useful for me because I use my corporate account as my primary email.
[1886.00 → 1890.00] And corporate accounts are not able to get in on Google inbox yet.
[1890.00 → 1891.00] But you have been using it.
[1891.00 → 1892.00] You want to talk about it?
[1892.00 → 1894.00] Yeah, I use both.
[1894.00 → 1896.00] I actually mainly use my corporate account as well.
[1896.00 → 1902.00] But I use my personal one because I have taken all of my like Hotmail accounts and stuff that he was talking about.
[1902.00 → 1905.00] Old accounts that are linked to too many things to get rid of.
[1905.00 → 1909.00] And I've ported all of them through that one remaining personal account that I have.
[1909.00 → 1913.00] So I'm using that one for like six different emails essentially.
[1913.00 → 1915.00] And so I actually use it.
[1915.00 → 1917.00] I got the invite from the same person he did.
[1917.00 → 1919.00] And it's kind of great.
[1919.00 → 1921.00] The email reminder thing is fantastic.
[1921.00 → 1927.00] Because like my mom will email me about some family gathering thing that I like really need to pay attention to.
[1927.00 → 1929.00] But I got it at 2 p.m. on a work day.
[1929.00 → 1932.00] Or I'll email you at 3 in the morning.
[1932.00 → 1933.00] Yeah.
[1933.00 → 1937.00] And that will get buried by other random crap by the time you actually arrive at work.
[1937.00 → 1939.00] So being able to...
[1939.00 → 1940.00] Yeah.
[1940.00 → 1943.00] And like I might have received it at 3 in the morning, and I'll be like, oh this is important.
[1943.00 → 1946.00] But starring things in Gmail puts them below you're important.
[1946.00 → 1948.00] And I just forget about them forever.
[1948.00 → 1949.00] Yeah.
[1949.00 → 1950.00] Which is not helpful.
[1950.00 → 1955.00] So now I can be like, remind me at this specific time or like later today or whatever.
[1955.00 → 1959.00] So with say work emails from Linus, I'll be like, remind me at like 10 a.m. or something.
[1959.00 → 1962.00] Like in the morning once I'm at work doing stuff.
[1962.00 → 1968.00] And with emails from like my mom, I'll be like, remind me at like 7 or 8 when I'm home and doing random stuff.
[1968.00 → 1970.00] So I find that really, really helpful.
[1970.00 → 1971.00] I like the reminder system.
[1971.00 → 1972.00] It's great.
[1972.00 → 1974.00] It will remind you on time.
[1974.00 → 1977.00] It'll put reminders of anything inside your email inbox.
[1977.00 → 1980.00] So when you go to check your emails, you're like, oh, I remember this now.
[1980.00 → 1983.00] It's actually a lot more helpful than just setting random timed reminders.
[1983.00 → 1988.00] Because you might be able to remind yourself earlier and that'll help you prepare, add, add, add.
[1988.00 → 1995.00] And it's very, very easy to get through stuff like Amazon plugging you with emails for toasters.
[1995.00 → 1999.00] Because you bought a toaster six months ago, and it thinks that you need 40 more.
[1999.00 → 2002.00] Because it'll bundle things in sections, say promotions.
[2002.00 → 2008.00] You can jump into promotions, read all the titles, and it'll give you a little bit of a blurb of the email as well.
[2008.00 → 2010.00] Which should be able to explain what it's all about.
[2010.00 → 2019.00] So I'll see like Amazon, like any Steam stuff, Play, all that kind of stuff all dumped in one spot with different sales and whatnot.
[2019.00 → 2022.00] And I'll scroll through it all and be like, wow, I don't want to spend money.
[2022.00 → 2024.00] Checkbox, they're all gone.
[2024.00 → 2028.00] It's very easy to really, really quickly get through those types of emails, which is really helpful.
[2028.00 → 2029.00] All right.
[2029.00 → 2032.00] So let's go ahead and move on to our next actual topic.
[2032.00 → 2036.00] Because I think we kind of got distracted a couple of times there in the last little bit.
[2036.00 → 2044.00] HP and, excuse me, HP and Microsoft are dropping the hammer.
[2044.00 → 2049.00] They're dropping a bomb, lowering the boom, and they're doing something with a hammer.
[2049.00 → 2055.00] Because Chrome books may not make any sense to me anymore.
[2055.00 → 2057.00] This looks really compelling.
[2057.00 → 2065.00] So they've launched the new HP Stream lineup that includes the Stream 7, the Stream 8, the Stream 11, and the Stream 13.
[2065.00 → 2068.00] So the 7 and the 8 are tablets.
[2068.00 → 2071.00] The 7 is a 7-inch Windows tablet at $100.
[2071.00 → 2074.00] Now they're not really saying anything about specs.
[2074.00 → 2076.00] We do know that it's an Intel-based solution.
[2076.00 → 2077.00] Yeah.
[2077.00 → 2082.00] So probably some kind of super low power Atom thing or even something else.
[2082.00 → 2084.00] Not 100% sure what it is.
[2084.00 → 2085.00] Probably Atom.
[2085.00 → 2089.00] And then the 8 is an 8-inch Windows tablet at $150.
[2089.00 → 2092.00] So this was originally posted on the forum by Top War gamer.
[2092.00 → 2094.00] And the original article here is from The Verge.
[2094.00 → 2097.00] And this is where things start to get crazy.
[2097.00 → 2104.00] The Stream 8 comes with 200 legs of free LTE data each month with no contract.
[2104.00 → 2105.00] So cool.
[2105.00 → 2107.00] And right now presumably through T-Mobile.
[2107.00 → 2111.00] Now I've been saying for a long time that I think that cloud storage is,
[2111.00 → 2118.00] cloud storage is super cool except for when you're on mobile, and you're using a lame-o data limit.
[2118.00 → 2126.00] Well now, okay, you're not going to be transferring like movies to and from your cloud storage with 200 legs.
[2126.00 → 2131.00] But if we're talking about a tablet that's going to be used predominantly for work,
[2131.00 → 2136.00] well that's lots for the odd text document and some pictures here and there.
[2136.00 → 2143.00] And that sounds fantastic, especially when I throw in this next little bit, which is that both tablets get a year of Office 365,
[2143.00 → 2149.00] one terabyte of OneDrive storage, and 60 minutes of Skype calling included in the purchase.
[2149.00 → 2151.00] Actually kind of awesome.
[2151.00 → 2154.00] That's like, I wonder if you break that value down, what that totals.
[2154.00 → 2157.00] I wonder how close that is to the total cost of the actual device.
[2157.00 → 2161.00] I think for the 7 that costs more, like sticker price.
[2161.00 → 2163.00] So you might as well just buy a 7.
[2163.00 → 2165.00] If you're going to use all those things.
[2165.00 → 2166.00] If you're going to use those services.
[2166.00 → 2167.00] Which I could see.
[2167.00 → 2169.00] I pay for an Office 365 account.
[2169.00 → 2170.00] It's awesome.
[2170.00 → 2171.00] I love it.
[2171.00 → 2173.00] I just, the way it works now is...
[2173.00 → 2178.00] I really like the graph creation, and I'm probably going to switch to Office 365 just because they look better.
[2178.00 → 2180.00] And whenever I create graphs, they don't look as good anymore.
[2180.00 → 2181.00] Yep.
[2181.00 → 2183.00] Office 365 is really great.
[2183.00 → 2193.00] And I hope that they move Windows to something like that because I think that personal licensing makes a lot more sense than device licensing in the modern world.
[2193.00 → 2195.00] Where my device is very interchangeable.
[2195.00 → 2202.00] I mean, I can switch over to a new phone within about, you know, an hour of drinking around and changing desktop wallpapers and ringtones and stuff.
[2202.00 → 2204.00] So the device is not the important thing.
[2204.00 → 2205.00] The important thing is me.
[2205.00 → 2211.00] I'm allowed to use Google Play Music and Office and Windows or whatever else.
[2211.00 → 2214.00] And wherever I happen to be, that should be where all of my stuff is.
[2214.00 → 2217.00] And this, this is that.
[2217.00 → 2219.00] This looks fantastic.
[2219.00 → 2222.00] Now, then things get even more interesting.
[2222.00 → 2230.00] Because you could kind of look at it, and you go, okay, well, Linus, a 7 and 8 inch low spec tablet is not exactly a competitor for a Chromebook.
[2230.00 → 2233.00] Because Chrome books are books.
[2233.00 → 2234.00] They're not books.
[2234.00 → 2235.00] They're laptops, actually.
[2235.00 → 2238.00] But the point is not necessarily the 7 and the 8.
[2238.00 → 2241.00] The point is the Stream 11 and Stream 13.
[2241.00 → 2246.00] So the 11 is an 11.6-inch laptop with an HD display at 200 bucks.
[2246.00 → 2252.00] And the 13 is a 13.3-inch laptop that has an option for touch screen, also assumed to be an HD display, priced at 230 bucks.
[2252.00 → 2260.00] Both using dual-core Ailerons with fanless designs, 32 gigs of flash storage, and both come with a free year of Office 365.
[2260.00 → 2261.00] Wow.
[2261.00 → 2263.00] That's kind of awesome.
[2263.00 → 2265.00] You know how you said the book thing?
[2265.00 → 2268.00] Well, laptops aren't technically tops either.
[2268.00 → 2270.00] Like spinning tops.
[2270.00 → 2271.00] Get it?
[2271.00 → 2272.00] Get it?
[2272.00 → 2273.00] Get it?
[2273.00 → 2274.00] Get it?
[2274.00 → 2275.00] You know how you put it on the web?
[2275.00 → 2276.00] Oh, that's so cool.
[2276.00 → 2277.00] They're not...
[2277.00 → 2278.00] Oh.
[2278.00 → 2279.00] All right.
[2279.00 → 2280.00] Yeah.
[2280.00 → 2281.00] So let's just move on now.
[2281.00 → 2282.00] So, you know what?
[2282.00 → 2283.00] We got to Twitter blitz this, guys.
[2283.00 → 2284.00] Chromebook or Stream.
[2284.00 → 2286.00] We want to hear from you guys.
[2286.00 → 2290.00] And maybe, I know it's 140 characters, but give us a couple thoughts about why.
[2290.00 → 2299.00] Because you look at Chrome OS and you kind of go, okay, well I can run a Chrome browser and I can run all my apps and like, you know, that's cool.
[2299.00 → 2301.00] in my browser, but...
[2301.00 → 2302.42] I've never liked that experience, personally.
[2302.66 → 2303.04] No, it's awful.
[2303.04 → 2304.56] I've never been interested in a Chromebook at any point.
[2304.56 → 2308.08] Look, I'm trying to present it as if I actually think it's a good idea, okay?
[2308.08 → 2308.14] Okay.
[2308.44 → 2310.40] So Chrome OS, so you got your...
[2310.40 → 2311.08] And you know what?
[2311.20 → 2315.02] When I did try to use it for a little while, whenever I had internet connectivity, it wasn't
[2315.02 → 2315.46] that bad.
[2315.68 → 2318.98] But the Chrome experience relies on connectivity.
[2319.24 → 2321.90] Everything runs in this browser, and things...
[2321.90 → 2322.98] Office 365 doesn't care.
[2323.14 → 2328.44] And, well, you can use Google's stuff offline and then sync it once you reach a connection
[2328.44 → 2328.66] again.
[2328.78 → 2330.04] Like, they do have answers to that.
[2330.04 → 2338.24] But the truth of the matter is that Office 365 is a paid solution, and Drive and Sheets
[2338.24 → 2343.48] and whatever are not a paid solution because a paid solution is just...
[2343.48 → 2343.82] One is a lot better.
[2343.84 → 2345.68] One is just a lot better than the other one.
[2345.80 → 2346.40] I'm...
[2346.40 → 2350.54] Honestly, I like Google Docs because of some of the collaboration stuff that allows us to
[2350.54 → 2350.84] do.
[2351.06 → 2351.60] Very cool.
[2351.66 → 2355.10] But a lot of times, if it's just something that I'm only going to be working on and not
[2355.10 → 2359.86] other people, I will use local solutions like Word and Excel because Google Docs is not
[2359.86 → 2360.32] that great.
[2360.32 → 2361.62] They're just better.
[2361.74 → 2361.92] Yeah.
[2362.04 → 2363.20] In a lot of ways.
[2363.28 → 2363.92] Even...
[2363.92 → 2364.24] Ugh.
[2364.34 → 2368.68] Like, I'm going to bring my love for Notepad++ up here for a second.
[2369.02 → 2373.54] But if you have it open in two locations, and you make revisions in one location and save
[2373.54 → 2376.84] it, when you go over to the other location, it won't just be broken.
[2377.32 → 2377.42] Right.
[2377.42 → 2381.80] When you try to even just click on the window, it'll be like, oh, this has been saved and
[2381.80 → 2382.80] remade on another machine.
[2382.80 → 2384.14] Would you like to reload the file?
[2384.34 → 2385.46] You just say yes and just book.
[2385.90 → 2387.56] So, like, there's even better...
[2387.56 → 2388.08] There's...
[2388.08 → 2390.78] Like, the collaboration for local stuff is not even that bad.
[2390.90 → 2391.14] Right.
[2391.26 → 2392.04] If you have multiple computers.
[2392.14 → 2394.32] And, like, I'll work on something at home, and I'll work on something at work.
[2394.72 → 2397.96] And if I'm working on it at home and then just leave and then save it also at work and
[2397.96 → 2399.06] come back and just like, oh, reload.
[2399.58 → 2399.76] Yeah.
[2399.84 → 2400.76] And the thing...
[2400.76 → 2406.78] And that kind of collaboration, so, like, personal self-collaboration almost, is great
[2406.78 → 2407.24] for that.
[2407.24 → 2413.38] But the other kind of collaboration, person-to-person collaboration, especially where I'm editing
[2413.38 → 2417.98] something that someone else produced, and I want to leave comments and I want to keep,
[2418.12 → 2422.46] like, I want to have, like, a really nicely organized change history, it's much better
[2422.46 → 2423.78] for me to use something like Office.
[2423.78 → 2425.36] It just works better.
[2426.32 → 2428.52] Google Docs has a pretty good change history and stuff.
[2428.72 → 2430.10] But I also like...
[2430.10 → 2431.88] It's not as well later.
[2432.22 → 2432.34] Yeah.
[2432.34 → 2433.16] I like Office as well.
[2433.18 → 2433.30] Yeah.
[2433.64 → 2434.62] Um, okay.
[2434.82 → 2435.96] So, right.
[2436.08 → 2436.24] Yeah.
[2436.28 → 2437.18] Let's go to the Twitter Blitz.
[2437.22 → 2438.16] I want to hear from you guys.
[2438.86 → 2440.12] I also had your responses at some point.
[2440.86 → 2442.44] What's wrong with the Outlook interface?
[2442.86 → 2443.34] You know what?
[2443.38 → 2446.24] I have to confess I haven't used it that recently.
[2446.56 → 2451.60] But if I were to do a review of it today, I'm sure I could find at least a dozen things
[2451.60 → 2453.46] that are just brain-dead about it.
[2453.78 → 2455.30] I mainly just don't like the app.
[2455.30 → 2458.82] Honestly, the online version, like, the web browser...
[2458.82 → 2461.52] The web version has some pretty annoying crap about it.
[2461.52 → 2463.58] Yeah, but it's not nearly as bad as Hotmail was.
[2463.58 → 2464.84] And it's a lot better than it used to be.
[2464.96 → 2465.14] Yeah.
[2466.18 → 2466.54] Okay.
[2467.06 → 2472.06] Alex says, I am all for the HP and Microsoft solution as I can't go without my desktop apps
[2472.06 → 2472.74] and move to a browser.
[2472.82 → 2473.22] You know what?
[2473.70 → 2474.42] Great point.
[2474.56 → 2475.70] We didn't even bring that up.
[2475.80 → 2477.12] It's a full Windows OS.
[2477.26 → 2477.46] Yeah.
[2477.46 → 2479.46] So you can actually install things on the laptops.
[2480.52 → 2481.46] We only have 32 gigs, but...
[2482.10 → 2485.22] But you can have stuff on it.
[2485.22 → 2485.28] Yeah.
[2485.28 → 2487.16] And you're not expecting to play games.
[2487.30 → 2489.70] So most of your apps won't even be that big, and you can probably fit it on the...
[2489.70 → 2493.16] Well, a big problem that I had with Chrome OS was things like codec compatibility.
[2493.42 → 2496.86] And I don't know if they've addressed that recently, but back when I looked at Acer's
[2496.86 → 2503.40] Chromebook, I was like, okay, so I can watch, like, these videos and not these other ones.
[2503.52 → 2504.90] And if you can just install, like...
[2504.90 → 2505.28] VLC.
[2505.44 → 2509.08] VLC, Windows Media Player Classic, and CCCP, you're just good for everything.
[2509.08 → 2510.96] And 32 gigs is not going to be a problem.
[2510.96 → 2516.14] That's still lots of storage for just those little things that make your life a little bit easier.
[2516.14 → 2516.50] You know?
[2516.50 → 2517.02] Just fix stuff.
[2517.16 → 2517.30] Yeah.
[2517.70 → 2518.06] Okay.
[2519.00 → 2522.96] Max says, stream because it would make a great cheap portable Linux device.
[2523.18 → 2523.78] Great point.
[2524.26 → 2527.12] Was never interested in Chrome or Chrome OS from Agent 47.
[2527.64 → 2529.84] This might be intriguing for all the extra stuff you get.
[2529.94 → 2531.82] Office 365 is actually good.
[2532.56 → 2533.18] Oh, sure.
[2533.24 → 2533.66] Why not?
[2533.78 → 2537.78] Let's experiment live and find out what this actually is.
[2537.78 → 2538.12] Just check it first.
[2539.30 → 2539.74] Okay.
[2540.08 → 2540.30] Yeah.
[2540.34 → 2540.72] You know what?
[2540.78 → 2542.46] Let's make that the official one.
[2542.46 → 2546.22] So, let's go ahead and, uh...
[2546.22 → 2547.96] Let's just post that here.
[2548.30 → 2551.30] I hope that I'm already logged in, because otherwise this is going to take me a second.
[2551.42 → 2551.92] Sorry, guys.
[2555.16 → 2555.92] Oh, oh!
[2556.06 → 2556.92] I typed!
[2556.98 → 2557.56] I suck!
[2557.84 → 2558.78] I'm a bad person!
[2559.34 → 2560.02] Oh, no, I got it.
[2560.44 → 2563.62] I typed, but it logged in any way, so apparently Twitch just doesn't care.
[2565.80 → 2566.36] All right.
[2566.60 → 2567.32] Close ad.
[2567.46 → 2568.28] Stop ad.
[2568.64 → 2570.54] Please, just let me send a message in the chat.
[2570.82 → 2571.08] In the...
[2571.08 → 2571.24] Whoops.
[2572.46 → 2574.88] All right.
[2574.92 → 2575.94] Let's pretend that didn't happen.
[2576.36 → 2576.74] All right.
[2576.78 → 2577.56] That's official now.
[2577.62 → 2579.40] So, let's go ahead and let's go back to Twitter here.
[2580.52 → 2581.36] Oh, my God.
[2581.70 → 2585.10] Tony says, stream, because there are no applications for Chrome OS.
[2585.42 → 2587.68] Now isn't fair, but it is very limited.
[2587.68 → 2587.82] Limited.
[2587.82 → 2588.34] You're very right.
[2589.00 → 2592.80] Definitely the stream 13, because I want Windows instead of Chrome OS, better compatibility.
[2593.58 → 2594.26] Spam Jazz.
[2594.40 → 2595.18] Oh, this is interesting.
[2595.34 → 2597.32] Our school supplied all the kids with Chrome books.
[2597.42 → 2600.02] They don't run plugins and players, so they're sort of a waste.
[2600.02 → 2603.58] I would rather have something running Windows than not, says Jack.
[2603.68 → 2606.38] I've used Chrome books and been very unhappy with them.
[2607.70 → 2608.10] MSI.
[2608.48 → 2608.80] Mm-hmm.
[2608.92 → 2609.22] Okay.
[2610.18 → 2613.06] I now want a laptop, and it's going to be a stream one with a touchscreen.
[2613.58 → 2614.40] Fascinating.
[2614.40 → 2616.56] I don't think we have ever...
[2616.56 → 2616.94] Oh, no.
[2617.00 → 2617.38] There we go.
[2617.44 → 2621.12] I was about to say, I don't think we've ever had the entire audience as unanimous about
[2621.12 → 2622.04] something as this.
[2622.86 → 2624.16] But BCD says...
[2624.16 → 2626.64] Oh, I think he might have misunderstood.
[2627.90 → 2631.28] Two of the devices are laptops with keyboards.
[2631.66 → 2631.88] Yeah.
[2632.34 → 2632.86] And they're still...
[2632.86 → 2633.86] That's a good point.
[2634.18 → 2634.36] Yeah.
[2634.36 → 2637.18] Because especially if you're in a production thing, like if you're doing work, and you need
[2637.18 → 2640.42] to use Excel or Word, not using a real keyboard is going to be really frustrating.
[2640.56 → 2641.94] This is a great point from Austin.
[2642.16 → 2646.36] Stream, because I don't think it's fair to say it's stupid and pointless, but...
[2647.00 → 2647.52] Stupid pointless.
[2647.74 → 2652.84] But Windows can do everything that Chrome OS can and more.
[2653.08 → 2657.38] So if you're getting a low-cost device where you're not saddled with that extra $100 burden
[2657.38 → 2662.14] of the Windows license, then yeah, why not have Windows?
[2662.24 → 2663.34] Because you can put a Chrome browser on Windows.
[2663.34 → 2666.18] Yeah, you can still install Chrome and you can still install Chrome apps.
[2666.82 → 2668.76] So, yay, best of both worlds.
[2669.68 → 2672.84] Chrome, Chrome, Chrome books, as far as I can tell...
[2672.84 → 2676.52] I mean, I'd love to review one of these laptops just so that I can get a feel for the build
[2676.52 → 2677.30] quality and everything.
[2677.52 → 2681.86] Because if they're decent, I don't understand why Chrome books get to exist in the world anymore
[2681.86 → 2682.22] at all.
[2682.82 → 2683.96] I never liked them in the first place.
[2684.02 → 2687.34] So now that there's something that just stomps them and actually looks interesting, like
[2687.34 → 2688.16] this is actually intriguing.
[2688.44 → 2692.40] I wouldn't have been able to do it for the schooling I did, but if you're taking like
[2692.40 → 2696.10] business or something like that, this makes a ton of sense, especially considering how
[2696.10 → 2696.64] cheap it is.
[2696.68 → 2702.70] You could almost use it as like a throwaway every single time your Office 365 subscription
[2702.70 → 2704.70] died and just get a new one.
[2705.16 → 2706.16] And it would almost be...
[2706.16 → 2707.00] And flip the old one.
[2707.12 → 2707.46] Yeah.
[2707.76 → 2712.42] And it would almost be like more cost-effective than just buying like a $1,000 laptop and
[2712.42 → 2716.22] carrying that through school because it's actually cheaper, and you could just try to
[2716.22 → 2720.04] sell off your old ones as you went through, and you'd have a constant Office 365 subscription,
[2720.88 → 2723.32] constant updates on your Skype payment.
[2723.80 → 2724.80] And what's the other one?
[2725.00 → 2725.22] Drive.
[2725.36 → 2726.08] A terabyte of...
[2726.08 → 2726.16] Yeah.
[2726.16 → 2726.28] Yeah.
[2726.28 → 2726.70] One drive.
[2726.88 → 2730.60] So you'd constantly have a terabyte of drive, constantly have Office 365, which you'd be paying
[2730.60 → 2731.24] for anyway.
[2732.02 → 2733.20] Constantly have Skype stuff.
[2733.30 → 2733.98] Well, not constantly.
[2734.18 → 2735.66] Have a fair amount of Skype time.
[2735.66 → 2738.68] And then a brand-new laptop every single year.
[2738.76 → 2740.98] And it's still cheaper than buying one $1,000 laptop.
[2741.18 → 2745.90] I can always count on you to give me the like supremely cheap bastard perspective on things,
[2745.98 → 2746.30] can't I?
[2746.56 → 2749.76] Knowing me, I would just buy one of them and then carry it the whole way through.
[2750.16 → 2754.00] But if you wanted to, you could do that as well.
[2754.00 → 2758.26] Speaking of being a supremely cheap bastard, let's move into our sponsor segments here.
[2758.26 → 2762.96] So we're not going to do the same thing that we did for Dollar Shave Club last time around
[2762.96 → 2767.74] where we used a no-name razor and I pretended to bleed all over the place.
[2767.82 → 2769.28] That stuff tasted awful.
[2769.48 → 2773.18] But what we will do is tell you guys about the benefits of Dollar Shave Club.
[2773.28 → 2778.64] So you can get high quality bathroom supplies, razors, shave butter, which is different from
[2778.64 → 2781.62] shave cream and actually not made of butter.
[2781.72 → 2782.56] That would be disgusting.
[2782.70 → 2782.96] Can you imagine?
[2782.96 → 2783.74] That would be really gross.
[2783.84 → 2784.90] Smearing butter all over your face.
[2784.90 → 2789.64] It's like, yeah, shave your face with butter so you can break out all over the place.
[2789.78 → 2790.10] Yeah.
[2790.86 → 2793.94] And then shave off your zits because that's a fact.
[2796.26 → 2797.32] No, no, no.
[2797.38 → 2802.94] Shave butter is just this clear stuff that they have that kind of smells nice, and you put
[2802.94 → 2803.76] it on your face to shave.
[2803.94 → 2807.10] And it's nice because it's clear so you can kind of see what you're doing and all that
[2807.10 → 2807.30] stuff.
[2807.52 → 2810.56] They've also got their one-wipe Charlies, peppermint-scented butt wipes for men.
[2810.56 → 2812.96] But the real big one is, of course, the razor.
[2812.96 → 2816.82] So you sign up, you pay a fraction of what you would pay if you were to go to the store
[2816.82 → 2817.46] and buy razors.
[2817.66 → 2822.96] You don't actually have to leave your house to look good enough to leave your house, which
[2822.96 → 2823.78] is great.
[2824.16 → 2824.70] I love that part.
[2825.00 → 2826.08] You do, don't you?
[2826.16 → 2826.80] It's amazing.
[2828.08 → 2829.66] You should be ashamed of yourself.
[2830.06 → 2833.82] I've been working on a secret project, so I've got a little bit of stuff going on.
[2833.82 → 2838.92] So visit dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus to learn more and join the club.
[2839.02 → 2841.88] It's available in Canada, the US, and Australia.
[2842.52 → 2848.16] And maybe if you guys who aren't in those places clamour loud enough, because I've personally
[2848.16 → 2853.04] received a ton of requests for Dollar Shave Club to expand outside those territories.
[2853.16 → 2856.54] I'm sitting here, I'm going, I do sponsorship spots.
[2856.54 → 2857.62] He doesn't run the company.
[2857.62 → 2858.70] Yeah, I'm not the CEO.
[2859.16 → 2860.94] So you guys got to contact them.
[2861.00 → 2862.14] Let them know that you're interested.
[2862.64 → 2865.88] And people in Twitch chat keep on saying, and this happens every week, but people in
[2865.88 → 2868.76] Twitch chat are saying that like, oh, he doesn't need razors.
[2868.84 → 2869.62] He obviously doesn't shave.
[2869.86 → 2871.58] You still have to shave if you have a beard.
[2871.88 → 2876.44] Like you, if I didn't, it would be like down here and disgusting and like all over my face.
[2876.58 → 2877.38] Yeah, more disgusting.
[2877.66 → 2877.80] Yeah.
[2877.86 → 2878.42] Even worse.
[2878.42 → 2881.90] I haven't shaved in a while because it's November, but yeah.
[2883.22 → 2885.62] I haven't shaved since the beginning of November either.
[2885.88 → 2886.28] Really?
[2886.54 → 2887.06] No, I haven't.
[2887.18 → 2890.66] I was like, that looks better than when we were at the Highlander thing.
[2890.68 → 2890.90] Yeah.
[2891.38 → 2891.82] All right.
[2891.90 → 2896.46] So, and then with the money that you save by joining Dollar Shave Club, you can go learn
[2896.46 → 2896.96] something.
[2896.96 → 2903.26] So go to lynda.com slash WAN show for a free seven-day trial of their service, where basically
[2903.26 → 2910.86] what happens is once every night at exactly the exact time that they require, you log into
[2910.86 → 2916.56] your PC and you do the course that they tell you to do, and you learn whatever it is that
[2916.56 → 2917.12] they dictate.
[2917.24 → 2917.84] No, I'm just kidding.
[2917.92 → 2919.04] It's actually the opposite of that.
[2919.36 → 2924.28] So the idea is that memberships are extremely reasonably priced, and you learn whatever you
[2924.28 → 2925.50] want at your own pace.
[2925.50 → 2928.42] They've got stuff that's more geared towards hobbyists.
[2928.54 → 2932.94] They've got stuff that's geared towards even potentially getting a job, like starting up
[2932.94 → 2937.98] a new career, whether it's photography or video editing or programming.
[2939.20 → 2945.52] And I get so much positive feedback from our viewers and our subscribers who are using
[2945.52 → 2948.82] lynda.com and are like, holy crap, Linus, I can't believe I never heard of this.
[2948.98 → 2952.64] They teach things so much better than you because they have actual industry experts that do their
[2952.64 → 2952.98] videos.
[2952.98 → 2957.70] It's not how people usually say it, but that's kind of what I read into it.
[2958.94 → 2961.60] But the point is they're adding new courses all the time.
[2961.68 → 2962.54] It's reasonably priced.
[2962.70 → 2965.86] And if you don't like it, there's a risk-free seven-day trial.
[2966.02 → 2967.94] All you have to do is sign up for the trial.
[2968.06 → 2969.66] And then if you hate it, then don't use it anymore.
[2969.82 → 2973.66] And if you like it, then use it whatever you want and learn whatever you want because it's
[2973.66 → 2979.16] a pretty darn cool service that can legitimately turn into job skills that you actually use
[2979.16 → 2979.90] every day.
[2980.12 → 2981.20] Like last night.
[2981.38 → 2983.58] Three people here use their Lynda skills.
[2984.12 → 2984.40] All right.
[2985.06 → 2988.28] So that's pretty much it for our sponsor spots for the day.
[2988.42 → 2990.74] Let's go ahead and move into our next topic, shall we?
[2990.80 → 2991.14] PayPal.
[2991.38 → 2991.54] PayPal.
[2991.54 → 2991.98] PayPal.
[2991.98 → 2994.66] I was like Apple Pay.
[2994.86 → 2995.50] It's like, what?
[2995.68 → 2998.46] Didn't we talk about last week about how PayPal hasn't really done anything?
[2998.62 → 2998.84] Yeah.
[2999.06 → 2999.42] Yeah.
[2999.54 → 3001.08] And like they've tried to do stuff.
[3001.26 → 3006.60] But I mean, like why did the incumbents sit around and wait for Apple to unify everything?
[3006.80 → 3008.20] And like, where are the innovations?
[3008.58 → 3009.90] This is an innovation.
[3010.36 → 3011.80] This I'm really excited about.
[3011.80 → 3018.06] PayPal has officially launched their pay after delivery service, which don't think of it
[3018.06 → 3022.70] as like, oh, you know, free stuff that I don't have to pay for or like.
[3022.84 → 3023.74] You still definitely have to pay.
[3023.74 → 3023.90] Yeah.
[3023.94 → 3025.50] You still definitely have to pay for it.
[3025.58 → 3028.08] But the point is trust.
[3028.28 → 3033.70] So it allows users to pay for their goods up to 14 days after they choose to make a purchase.
[3033.86 → 3036.92] So if you buy from someone, I'd love to say someone like Amazon.
[3037.06 → 3038.36] Unfortunately, they don't take PayPal.
[3038.46 → 3039.00] Not at all.
[3039.00 → 3043.32] But if you buy from someone else online, then basically it arrives.
[3043.38 → 3048.62] You kind of go like, yes, this appears to be an actual mobile communication device.
[3048.72 → 3048.94] Okay.
[3048.94 → 3049.44] It's all good.
[3049.50 → 3053.26] So the money doesn't come out of your account until you're satisfied that you've actually
[3053.26 → 3054.78] received the device that you did.
[3055.00 → 3056.08] How cool is that?
[3056.14 → 3056.90] That's freaking awesome.
[3057.00 → 3058.68] And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[3059.04 → 3061.48] So they actually partnered with Burger King.
[3061.84 → 3063.56] And this, this I love.
[3063.86 → 3064.04] Yeah.
[3064.08 → 3064.72] Oh God.
[3065.06 → 3068.02] So you can order your food ahead of time.
[3068.02 → 3070.94] So, so this doesn't have to be like 14 days after the fact.
[3071.00 → 3072.30] This could be like 20 minutes.
[3072.40 → 3075.16] Be like, to dog, I'm going to stop by the Burger King.
[3075.26 → 3076.12] Have my order ready.
[3076.30 → 3078.34] And the payment drops out of your account.
[3078.42 → 3080.54] Like it's, it's like preauthorized and prepaid.
[3080.84 → 3082.38] And you just go pick up your food.
[3082.64 → 3085.22] Fast food just got faster.
[3085.66 → 3086.10] America.
[3087.62 → 3088.10] America.
[3088.10 → 3088.22] America.
[3089.78 → 3090.88] I'm in North America.
[3090.88 → 3093.98] So I consider myself part of America when I make fun of.
[3094.00 → 3095.26] But that probably won't come to us.
[3095.84 → 3096.50] No, probably not.
[3096.84 → 3101.22] Just like we're not getting Apple Pay or Google Wallet or this.
[3101.62 → 3102.36] Or anything cool.
[3103.80 → 3104.20] Yeah.
[3104.20 → 3106.54] I kind of like, I felt like really sucky.
[3106.62 → 3110.40] Because we're doing as fast as possible over on the Tech Wiki channel about Apple Pay.
[3110.50 → 3112.98] Because I think there's a lot of confusion out there about it.
[3113.50 → 3115.90] And so I just like, I kind of run through the basics.
[3116.16 → 3120.08] And then at the end, I was just kind of tempted to say, like, like get a little Canadian flag
[3120.08 → 3120.38] or something.
[3120.46 → 3123.22] Be like, but none of this matters to me.
[3123.32 → 3125.96] Cause Apple Pay is like, it's only speculation right now.
[3126.04 → 3127.20] Apple won't comment on it.
[3127.20 → 3131.12] But the speculation is that it's like a year plus out for sure.
[3131.38 → 3131.94] Oh my goodness.
[3132.00 → 3135.74] Even though the technology, it's like the actual, the phone.
[3135.86 → 3138.18] And this is not an Apple phone, but I hope you guys get my point.
[3138.44 → 3141.82] The NFC chip is not revolutionary.
[3142.46 → 3142.86] No.
[3143.38 → 3143.54] No.
[3143.72 → 3144.20] At all.
[3144.56 → 3149.68] And, and, and that's where a lot of the confusion about Apple Pay versus Google Wallet comes from.
[3149.72 → 3153.50] Where people kind of go, oh, well, why is Apple getting so much attention and support for this?
[3153.52 → 3154.76] It's the same thing as Google Wallet.
[3154.76 → 3155.92] It's not.
[3155.92 → 3159.34] But on the back end, it is not the same thing.
[3159.70 → 3163.52] So Apple needs to build those relationships with the financial institutions, which are
[3163.52 → 3168.22] very different in Canada from, from the U.S. in order to actually enable it and provide
[3168.22 → 3168.78] the service here.
[3169.02 → 3169.28] So, yeah.
[3170.02 → 3170.66] So there you go.
[3171.80 → 3175.14] I'm excited about this PayPal thing five years from now.
[3175.38 → 3177.14] Five, yeah, whatever it actually happens.
[3177.16 → 3180.06] Speaking of five years from now, originally posted by Tech Dreamer.
[3180.56 → 3184.26] By the way, Tech Dreamer was also the one for the, the PayPal one.
[3184.26 → 3186.28] And it was Top War Gamer for the HP stream one.
[3186.46 → 3188.32] We've got so much amazing news this week.
[3188.40 → 3189.46] This week's actually quite good.
[3189.56 → 3190.84] Go, go, go with this one.
[3190.86 → 3190.88] Okay.
[3190.88 → 3191.80] So Oculus news.
[3191.94 → 3196.04] Although, um, not, also not hugely Oculus news at the same time.
[3196.08 → 3196.18] No.
[3196.18 → 3199.72] A lot of people are freaking out about this because he's like, it's months away, not years.
[3199.86 → 3200.70] Although the speculation.
[3200.70 → 3202.94] I could still need 11 months or 15 months.
[3203.06 → 3203.24] Yeah.
[3203.34 → 3206.24] The speculation for a long time has been late 2015.
[3206.98 → 3212.60] So this isn't actually, like, I was like, yeah, because this is more of a confirmation.
[3212.70 → 3213.00] Okay.
[3213.32 → 3215.36] Which is great because I'm not super into rumours.
[3215.36 → 3220.60] So this is actually coming from him, which is awesome.
[3220.72 → 3222.34] Because now we know it's coming then.
[3222.56 → 3229.32] But I think when the CEO says it's months away, I think the implication is not 11.9 months.
[3229.56 → 3229.84] No.
[3230.04 → 3233.44] I think the implication is, because when you say months.
[3233.46 → 3235.40] Well, he says, he says many months, I think.
[3235.58 → 3235.78] Yeah.
[3235.88 → 3238.08] It's months, not years away, but many months.
[3238.72 → 3240.06] So he does mean quite a few.
[3240.16 → 3243.32] I still think it'll be, like, Q3, probably Q4 2015.
[3244.48 → 3246.16] But yeah, I'm super stoked.
[3246.26 → 3250.12] If you haven't seen the new prototype that they've released, it looks a lot wider.
[3250.50 → 3254.46] It looks like they've probably messed with the aspect ratio a little bit, which could be really cool.
[3256.08 → 3262.40] They're still talking about how keyboard and keyboards, mice, game pads are all not really up to the job.
[3262.40 → 3265.62] And neither is, like, super basic gesture control.
[3265.62 → 3271.60] He says they're urging larger companies not to rush their products out and to try and just make the best solution they can.
[3271.74 → 3278.34] And then release it because they don't want to, like, work the waters with crappy products, essentially.
[3278.60 → 3278.72] Yes.
[3278.90 → 3281.74] They don't want to spoil the awesomeness that is VR right now.
[3281.92 → 3285.24] It has killed technologies in the past.
[3285.26 → 3286.82] It's killed VR in the past.
[3286.94 → 3287.22] Yep.
[3287.58 → 3288.42] It has.
[3288.94 → 3290.22] More than once, actually.
[3290.22 → 3290.58] Yeah.
[3290.58 → 3298.74] So they're trying to make sure that other companies don't ruin it for all the companies that are trying to do it properly.
[3298.86 → 3303.50] Not just Oculus, but all the companies that are trying to take their time and properly release these products.
[3303.54 → 3308.22] Because they are extremely new and people are going to potentially get extremely motion sick.
[3308.42 → 3311.60] We all saw Lou when we were trying out the roller coaster stuff.
[3311.70 → 3311.84] Yep.
[3311.84 → 3314.10] When he tried the last one, he was like, no, I'm done.
[3314.20 → 3314.98] Almost immediately.
[3315.44 → 3316.24] He couldn't handle it.
[3316.62 → 3318.48] And it's going to hit people randomly.
[3318.72 → 3320.80] Certain people will feel it a lot more than others.
[3320.98 → 3323.62] And it's not going to be like, oh, my big tough dudes, I don't get motion sickness.
[3323.80 → 3325.32] Like, that's not really how it's going to work.
[3325.44 → 3327.86] And it'll be different things that hit different people.
[3327.86 → 3329.78] Like, I was able to handle the rides.
[3330.20 → 3347.78] But in Kukri Forest, when I fell off of a cliff, the way that the camera was controlled by my fingers, but also by my head, it felt like someone took my stomach and wrung it out like a dishcloth all of a sudden.
[3348.34 → 3354.36] And it took a while of like, oh, wow, I better not touch that thumb stick to have it settle down again.
[3354.50 → 3355.52] So it's real.
[3355.66 → 3356.42] It's a real thing.
[3356.42 → 3360.68] It's real, like you just definitely said, it totally affects people differently.
[3361.54 → 3366.60] Some people can, like, be standing up facing backwards during a roller coaster ride and not care.
[3366.94 → 3370.34] And then go through something like you did and be like, holy crap, that's not okay.
[3370.60 → 3370.68] Yeah.
[3371.20 → 3373.10] So, yeah, we need to be careful.
[3373.28 → 3374.84] But it's coming soon, which is really cool.
[3374.98 → 3376.66] I've been playing a little bit of X-Wing lately.
[3377.04 → 3378.14] Because I was just like...
[3378.14 → 3378.82] You had your stream?
[3379.02 → 3379.42] Holy crap.
[3379.58 → 3380.62] Oh, oh, oh.
[3381.14 → 3381.98] Terrible story.
[3382.44 → 3384.38] My Top Gun joystick.
[3384.82 → 3385.16] Oh, no.
[3385.16 → 3386.26] Last night?
[3386.62 → 3386.96] Oh, no.
[3387.04 → 3390.18] I was like, I was like, I was kind of too excited.
[3390.44 → 3391.64] And I had my son on my lap.
[3391.64 → 3391.88] Oh, no.
[3392.08 → 3393.68] So like, I was kind of awkward.
[3393.86 → 3395.12] And I was like, I was going around.
[3395.26 → 3396.90] I was dogfighting with a TIE fighter.
[3397.02 → 3398.30] And I was like, pew, pew, pew, snap.
[3400.42 → 3400.82] Oh.
[3401.18 → 3403.94] My trigger button snapped inside the housing.
[3403.94 → 3405.66] It's a clean break.
[3405.66 → 3407.06] It sounds like it might be repairable.
[3407.20 → 3408.00] It's a clean break.
[3408.08 → 3408.32] Okay.
[3408.32 → 3412.06] And I think that the solution is going to be one of two things or both.
[3412.18 → 3413.70] So maybe as a temporary fix.
[3413.80 → 3413.98] Okay.
[3414.14 → 3416.90] What I can do is, because superglue never works for something like that.
[3417.30 → 3421.38] But what you can do, what I've actually had a lot of success with is a thin needle and
[3421.38 → 3423.60] heat it up with a blowtorch, red-hot.
[3423.86 → 3425.26] You position it in the right place.
[3425.36 → 3426.02] You glue it.
[3426.02 → 3426.34] To melt them together.
[3426.34 → 3430.48] And then you actually stab through the break from different angles.
[3430.74 → 3434.32] And then you kind of melt around the outside and smooth it.
[3434.78 → 3434.84] Yeah.
[3434.90 → 3438.30] I have found that that has held up almost as well as the original strength.
[3438.82 → 3439.16] Welding.
[3439.44 → 3439.70] Yeah.
[3440.04 → 3442.44] So like, kind of like plastic welding.
[3442.66 → 3442.76] Yeah.
[3442.90 → 3443.82] So I'm going to try that.
[3443.90 → 3445.72] And then if that doesn't work, then I'll...
[3445.72 → 3448.26] Someone in Twitch is going to be like, oh my God, that's not welding at all.
[3448.38 → 3448.82] But like...
[3448.82 → 3449.16] We know.
[3449.32 → 3449.46] Yeah.
[3449.54 → 3451.22] So then I'll figure out a way to 3D print one.
[3451.36 → 3451.56] Yeah.
[3451.82 → 3453.96] And then that'll make my Top Gun joystick even cooler.
[3454.08 → 3456.32] Because I can get like a bright orange or like...
[3456.34 → 3459.34] Bright pink trigger on it.
[3459.46 → 3459.94] That would be sick.
[3460.06 → 3461.28] I was so sad.
[3461.36 → 3462.02] Because I was like playing with my...
[3462.02 → 3462.74] I thought you were going to...
[3462.74 → 3466.08] Telling me that story, I thought you were going to like to snap it off the base or something.
[3466.30 → 3466.40] No.
[3466.40 → 3467.72] I was like, oh my God.
[3467.72 → 3471.94] No, but I was upset because I was playing with my son, and he was enjoying blowing up
[3471.94 → 3472.64] the bad guys.
[3472.80 → 3472.90] Yeah.
[3473.08 → 3473.64] He's...
[3473.64 → 3474.48] He hasn't...
[3474.48 → 3477.62] This is only the second time he's actually seen a game being played.
[3477.78 → 3481.80] Like I don't really do the whole lots of screen time with my thing.
[3481.86 → 3482.76] I don't really believe in it.
[3482.82 → 3485.46] I think little kids should spend most of their time in reality.
[3486.34 → 3489.92] But he was really enjoying it.
[3490.30 → 3491.10] And so we had...
[3491.10 → 3494.44] I never game with speakers anymore because usually he's sleeping.
[3494.56 → 3498.50] So we had the speakers on so he could actually hear the voice chatter over the radio and like
[3498.50 → 3499.44] pew pew pew pew pew.
[3499.64 → 3499.84] Yeah.
[3499.84 → 3503.52] And he loves the Star Wars movies.
[3503.96 → 3505.22] He's only seen them once.
[3505.38 → 3507.46] Again, not a ton of screen time with him.
[3507.54 → 3510.64] But he had a Darth Vader plush from when he was very little.
[3510.76 → 3512.52] And I have the most adorable videos.
[3512.98 → 3515.82] Because we used to play this game with him when he was really quite young.
[3515.82 → 3520.70] where I would lift him up, and I would say, say goodnight monkey.
[3521.08 → 3523.00] And he had like a vinyl monkey sticker on his wall.
[3523.36 → 3524.82] And say, say goodnight giraffe.
[3525.18 → 3526.24] And there's like a giraffe sticker.
[3526.78 → 3527.90] And he would like say...
[3527.90 → 3530.16] And so he'd be all happy, and he'd be like, yeah, yeah.
[3530.34 → 3532.02] And so, you know, say goodnight, goodnight.
[3532.28 → 3535.16] And then I'd say, say goodnight Darth Vader.
[3535.34 → 3537.52] And he would squirm and try to get away from him.
[3537.52 → 3539.26] Because he had like a voice thing.
[3539.52 → 3539.94] Like...
[3539.94 → 3541.68] Yeah, yeah.
[3541.88 → 3543.10] And so I played it a couple of times.
[3543.28 → 3552.04] And it's amazing how the psychological fear that goes into something like a costume design
[3552.04 → 3558.54] goes so much deeper than that character did bad things and is therefore scary.
[3558.80 → 3560.98] That mask is frightening.
[3561.32 → 3562.72] Even without the voice.
[3562.72 → 3568.18] And even without the actions of blowing up the planet Alderman and forcing Leia to watch.
[3568.46 → 3569.68] Like, even without that.
[3569.84 → 3570.52] It's terrifying.
[3570.88 → 3573.36] So he didn't like Darth Vader for a long time.
[3573.38 → 3575.14] And I would do it to him all the time because I thought it was hilarious.
[3575.44 → 3578.30] So every night before bed, it'd be like, say goodnight monkey.
[3579.16 → 3579.96] Say goodnight Darth Vader.
[3580.10 → 3580.30] No.
[3580.62 → 3580.82] No.
[3581.18 → 3581.82] No Darth Vader.
[3582.18 → 3583.22] No Darth Vader.
[3584.00 → 3587.88] And I forget where I was going with this.
[3588.04 → 3588.48] Right.
[3588.48 → 3593.26] So he really liked the Star Wars-y-ness of it as well.
[3593.42 → 3594.24] So that's...
[3594.24 → 3596.68] This became a long ramble story.
[3597.42 → 3598.36] I liked it.
[3598.44 → 3599.20] I thought that was cool.
[3599.30 → 3599.74] Intel.
[3600.42 → 3601.88] We're finally getting some details.
[3602.02 → 3610.66] And this was posted by Tech Fanboy about the upcoming LGA 1151 and Z170 chipset.
[3610.68 → 3611.16] 170, yeah.
[3611.40 → 3611.68] Really?
[3611.80 → 3612.16] 170?
[3612.32 → 3614.30] It's like, this is what Intel does when they run out of numbers.
[3614.30 → 3614.40] A bunch.
[3616.20 → 3617.06] Like, okay.
[3617.06 → 3625.18] And LGA 1151, they're going to run out of numbers between 1,150 and 1,159.
[3625.70 → 3627.66] I was pretty tired when I read this.
[3627.86 → 3629.42] And I saw 1151.
[3629.90 → 3633.96] And all I could think of was, like, they should have had this giant, ridiculous press conference.
[3634.28 → 3637.40] And then just been, like, slowly put the letters on screen.
[3637.54 → 3638.04] Like, L.
[3638.52 → 3639.02] G.
[3639.62 → 3640.06] A.
[3640.40 → 3641.36] And then 11.
[3641.54 → 3643.50] And have it, like, fairly rhythmically.
[3643.50 → 3644.38] And then 1150.
[3644.56 → 3645.86] And then, like, a huge delay.
[3645.86 → 3647.66] One.
[3647.94 → 3649.06] And then, like, fireworks.
[3649.08 → 3650.12] Like, crazy pyrotechnics.
[3650.12 → 3650.82] Like, drop the base.
[3652.60 → 3653.80] Dubstep pyrotechnics.
[3653.88 → 3655.62] Like, oh my god, it's a one.
[3656.70 → 3658.02] That's all I could think of.
[3658.06 → 3658.78] So now we've had...
[3658.78 → 3659.38] That's how that should have been done.
[3659.42 → 3660.84] Now there's officially no pattern.
[3661.06 → 3663.98] Intel is officially as good at naming things as Microsoft.
[3664.24 → 3668.20] Because we've got 1156, 1155, 1150, and 1151.
[3668.20 → 3671.32] So we were going backwards, and then a lot backwards, and then a little bit forward.
[3673.46 → 3673.82] Ridiculous.
[3674.08 → 3677.44] So, to be clear, guys, that's not because it's the number of the socket.
[3677.56 → 3678.94] It's the number of pins in the socket.
[3678.94 → 3679.14] Yeah.
[3679.14 → 3680.62] So I get it.
[3680.62 → 3688.36] But it's going to support both DDR4 and DDR3 memory, which is pretty cool, but not at the same time.
[3688.42 → 3689.26] You'll have to choose.
[3690.08 → 3692.92] And, I mean, guys, basically it's going to come down to...
[3692.92 → 3694.56] This is like a stepping stone one.
[3694.84 → 3695.00] Yeah.
[3695.00 → 3698.46] Just like how the 9...
[3698.46 → 3704.16] I want to say 925 chipsets supported both DDR1 and DDR2.
[3704.42 → 3705.66] That's what we're looking at again.
[3705.76 → 3708.20] There's not going to be a big performance difference between them.
[3708.26 → 3711.40] It's going to be bought whatever's cheaper at the time that you're buying whatever it is you're buying.
[3712.30 → 3721.42] The new chipset supports single by 16, dual by 8X, or a single 8X and two 4X PCI Express 3.0 slots.
[3721.42 → 3728.36] I really hope that NVIDIA at some point revises their SLI guidelines so that we can have triple SLI on 8, 4, and 4.
[3728.54 → 3736.34] But I also kind of understand why, especially if what I suspect they're doing is doing more communication over the P-Stat Express bus is actually happening.
[3736.62 → 3736.66] Yeah.
[3737.06 → 3739.92] Supports two memory channels with two modules each.
[3740.60 → 3745.12] Six SATA 3, six gigabits per second ports and 20 lanes for PCI-E total.
[3745.12 → 3751.94] We'll support a maximum of three SATA Express X2 ports and either four N.2 or two SATA Express.
[3752.52 → 3758.88] Actually, not 100% sure if those are completely transcribed correctly, but the original article is from KitGuru.net.
[3758.94 → 3760.16] So you guys can check it out over there.
[3760.32 → 3764.88] And the boards will support up to 14 USB ports, 10 of which can be Intel USB 3.0 ports.
[3764.88 → 3768.84] But as of now, USB 3.1 is unsupported.
[3769.98 → 3770.54] Dun-dun-dun.
[3770.78 → 3773.06] So that's the new 10 gigabits per second USB.
[3775.14 → 3776.08] I would, yeah.
[3776.20 → 3777.12] Not super interested.
[3777.68 → 3778.82] In USB 3.1?
[3779.02 → 3779.30] No.
[3779.60 → 3779.80] Oh.
[3781.08 → 3782.56] Largely because it doesn't have that.
[3782.56 → 3788.00] Yeah, that and these are going to be for Bradwell processors, which are, we have another article.
[3788.44 → 3788.60] Yeah.
[3788.60 → 3789.68] I'm going to scroll down to it.
[3790.04 → 3794.66] But upcoming Bradwell is rumoured to be 3% faster than Haswell clock for clock.
[3794.84 → 3800.66] So unless Intel has found a way to squeeze higher clock speeds out of their chips for the first time in a lot of generations,
[3801.16 → 3805.44] we're not going to see like a massive paradigm shifting performance improvement.
[3805.66 → 3805.96] Nope.
[3805.96 → 3813.28] So don't throw away your LGA 1150 PC just yet.
[3813.44 → 3813.74] Yeah.
[3814.28 → 3815.14] Not so much.
[3816.98 → 3820.34] Dawn gate was cancelled, and I don't know how many people cared, but you can get your money back.
[3820.44 → 3822.44] So if you bought into Dawn gate, go get your money back.
[3822.44 → 3823.48] Well, I think that's cool.
[3823.64 → 3824.90] I think the fact that they're just...
[3824.90 → 3825.96] You think it's cool that they cancelled it?
[3826.06 → 3828.10] I think it's cool that they're giving everyone's money back.
[3828.10 → 3832.22] And I think it's cool that they had the balls to cancel something instead of just bringing it to market,
[3832.48 → 3834.24] getting a bunch of people to buy it, and then abandoning it.
[3834.46 → 3834.56] Yeah.
[3834.56 → 3836.76] I think that this is...
[3836.76 → 3837.30] And they're letting it...
[3837.30 → 3839.66] One thing that's also cool, if we're going to jump on the cool screen...
[3839.66 → 3840.66] So this is EA, to be clear.
[3840.80 → 3840.96] Yeah.
[3841.02 → 3845.00] So Dawn gate was an EA, sort of League of Legends style MOB.
[3845.60 → 3847.98] Is that they're letting it continue to operate for 90 days?
[3848.20 → 3848.38] Yep.
[3848.56 → 3851.80] So people that did like it can kind of wean themselves off, which is actually kind of cool.
[3852.12 → 3854.18] So it's been in beta for 18 months.
[3854.64 → 3856.52] And basically what they had to say was,
[3856.60 → 3859.44] well, we built a game that wasn't just a clone of existing Mobs,
[3859.52 → 3862.54] but that tried to push things forward, and it didn't work.
[3862.54 → 3865.28] So the project's off.
[3865.46 → 3865.86] It's done.
[3866.86 → 3870.96] Everyone gets a refund, and we're not going to try and turn this into something that it's not.
[3871.06 → 3873.24] And I say, good job, EA.
[3873.46 → 3873.64] Yeah.
[3873.76 → 3875.56] There's no actual negative news here.
[3875.80 → 3876.10] Yeah.
[3876.22 → 3877.12] Like, how is...
[3877.12 → 3877.44] How is...
[3877.44 → 3878.76] Unless you really liked Dawn gate.
[3879.50 → 3879.86] Yeah.
[3880.24 → 3881.26] And like, well, okay.
[3881.32 → 3883.38] There's going to be people that really liked Dawn gate.
[3883.48 → 3886.32] Every single time that a game gets closed, there's people that get screwed over.
[3886.50 → 3886.82] Yeah.
[3886.82 → 3888.16] And that really sucks.
[3888.16 → 3889.98] But at least they don't get screwed out of any money.
[3890.74 → 3892.12] Yes, they don't get screwed out of any money.
[3892.34 → 3896.38] And they don't get this like abandoned, abandoned, empty experience,
[3896.56 → 3898.18] which the game probably would have turned into,
[3898.44 → 3901.56] and then just been depressed and had bad memories.
[3901.76 → 3903.30] Now they're like, I liked that game.
[3903.30 → 3904.60] And it sucks that it didn't become a thing.
[3904.70 → 3904.80] Yeah.
[3904.82 → 3905.44] That was fun.
[3905.52 → 3906.04] That was cool.
[3906.28 → 3911.04] I mean, I think the only thing EA could do to make this even cooler,
[3911.04 → 3915.22] and for them to be like, wow, good guy EA, and we would actually...
[3915.22 → 3916.24] Okay, we would have...
[3916.24 → 3918.18] If they gave them like some credit or something?
[3918.36 → 3919.92] No, what I would want them to do...
[3919.92 → 3920.88] Actually, that would be...
[3920.88 → 3921.74] Okay, that would work.
[3921.74 → 3922.88] They like gave them a game on the origin store or something?
[3922.88 → 3924.16] Some credit in the origin store.
[3924.24 → 3924.34] Yeah.
[3924.40 → 3925.78] Here are five bucks off a new game.
[3925.86 → 3926.86] Go enjoy something else.
[3926.98 → 3927.86] Hey, we're sorry about this.
[3927.92 → 3928.10] Yeah.
[3928.32 → 3929.30] That would be super cool.
[3929.62 → 3935.36] Another super cool thing would be if they turned the game over to someone else.
[3935.44 → 3935.52] Oh.
[3935.52 → 3937.80] Turned the game over to the community and went, look, okay.
[3937.92 → 3938.84] That would be awesome.
[3938.84 → 3942.22] We're not going to support it anymore, but you know what?
[3942.24 → 3944.36] If you guys really want to run with this, then go for it.
[3944.36 → 3945.80] Go with like the Netscape thing.
[3946.18 → 3948.40] Where they're like, we're kind of closing off, but you can have it,
[3948.44 → 3950.64] and then Firefox jumps on the train and carries it forward.
[3950.96 → 3952.10] Or whatever it is.
[3952.10 → 3952.88] Or whatever would ever happen.
[3952.88 → 3954.34] That would actually be super awesome.
[3954.62 → 3954.78] Yeah.
[3954.90 → 3956.54] I don't think they will, but that would be super awesome.
[3956.64 → 3959.02] Because I think that for like a...
[3959.02 → 3963.16] Even for the open source community, to try to develop a game from Square One
[3963.16 → 3964.76] is a bit of an ambitious project.
[3964.76 → 3968.06] And if they could take this even just as a framework and nuke a lot of it
[3968.06 → 3970.36] and recreate things, that would be a lot easier.
[3970.88 → 3971.06] Yeah.
[3971.14 → 3973.42] That would be a very, very, very cool thing.
[3973.58 → 3978.16] In this world of microtransaction-y, actually massive companies
[3978.16 → 3980.62] that have this image of like, you know, good guy Riot.
[3980.74 → 3984.44] But these are like big companies with a lot of money that like...
[3984.44 → 3986.76] It's funny because people kind of go,
[3986.76 → 3991.88] Oh, like Apple, like big company, therefore like bad or whatever.
[3992.02 → 3996.32] But these gaming companies are also like big, super money-driven companies.
[3996.42 → 3997.14] So don't kid yourself.
[3997.56 → 3998.32] I mean, I would think...
[3998.32 → 4001.96] I think it would be really cool for just a community-driven project
[4001.96 → 4003.28] to come in and challenge something like that.
[4003.28 → 4005.52] I really don't think it'll happen, but it would be awesome.
[4005.54 → 4006.78] Then a bunch of money would get involved,
[4006.92 → 4008.16] and some people would rise to the top,
[4008.20 → 4008.92] and they'd make a bunch of money.
[4008.96 → 4010.24] It would turn into the same thing all over again.
[4010.26 → 4011.20] I mean, it's just one of those things.
[4011.28 → 4012.10] Money is what it is.
[4012.10 → 4014.58] I feel like right now Ubisoft and EA are really close to each other,
[4014.80 → 4017.46] and Ubisoft is like digging really ferociously
[4017.46 → 4020.50] and throwing the dirt over into EA's hole and filling it up.
[4024.18 → 4026.68] The word hole can never escape an awkward cause.
[4026.82 → 4027.76] I didn't even mean that.
[4027.86 → 4030.62] But like EA is not doing horrible things.
[4030.88 → 4031.20] I know.
[4031.40 → 4032.04] It's amazing.
[4032.70 → 4033.76] It's like they care.
[4033.86 → 4036.10] Like they had that big patch for Battlefield 4.
[4036.26 → 4038.72] They gave away some free stuff to people using Sims.
[4038.72 → 4044.06] They aren't pulling their games out of Steam in the UK,
[4044.36 → 4047.36] with the rumour being that they're going to pull their games out of Steam entirely.
[4047.62 → 4048.48] No, I think they did.
[4048.48 → 4049.26] Their Christmas launch games.
[4049.36 → 4049.84] Did they already?
[4049.96 → 4052.24] I'm pretty sure this is like a...
[4052.24 → 4053.52] It's out of Steam.
[4053.70 → 4055.82] Or at least it's out of Steam in UK and I believe US.
[4057.06 → 4062.12] I think the outrage for this should have been at the fact
[4062.12 → 4065.98] that if you bought one of their games on Steam already,
[4065.98 → 4069.36] it was just giving it to you in Play, and it just launched Play.
[4069.58 → 4071.34] I think that's where the rage should have been.
[4071.54 → 4074.00] Because this honestly doesn't really change anything.
[4074.34 → 4074.90] Yeah, you're right.
[4075.02 → 4078.70] You're going from not being able to buy it in Steam.
[4079.36 → 4081.72] I mean, you're going from being able to buy it in Steam,
[4081.80 → 4084.60] but realistically just having the game on your Play account
[4084.60 → 4087.20] and having to run Play and having to launch the game out of Play
[4087.20 → 4089.00] and dealing with all the crap that that has
[4089.00 → 4092.40] to just not being able to buy it on Steam
[4092.40 → 4095.56] and having the entire rest of the experience be exactly the same.
[4095.88 → 4098.72] So I think the rage should have already happened
[4098.72 → 4102.32] and it should have been from the forcible use of Play
[4102.32 → 4106.16] and this should have just been piled on top of that
[4106.16 → 4107.60] because that was super annoying.
[4108.14 → 4109.76] Because the conversation that we had...
[4109.76 → 4110.92] Double DRM is lame.
[4111.52 → 4111.74] Yes.
[4111.74 → 4112.00] And bad.
[4112.14 → 4112.84] It is really lame.
[4112.88 → 4114.50] It's like Games for Windows Live.
[4114.50 → 4116.90] That whole stupid thing with...
[4116.90 → 4118.92] Remember Batman Arkham Asylum?
[4119.62 → 4121.02] How unless you...
[4121.02 → 4122.64] Like how you could get stuck
[4122.64 → 4124.72] and it never got patched to my knowledge
[4124.72 → 4127.84] until they finally just got rid of Games for Windows Live entirely.
[4128.08 → 4130.00] But you could get stuck in a loop
[4130.00 → 4132.30] where you would sign in to Games for Windows Live
[4132.30 → 4133.96] and it would reboot the game
[4133.96 → 4135.94] and unless you did something,
[4136.30 → 4137.70] it would make you sign in again
[4137.70 → 4138.76] and reboot the game again
[4138.76 → 4140.06] and you could do it over and over and over again
[4140.06 → 4140.48] and never sign in.
[4140.48 → 4142.28] I got that game from my brother for Christmas
[4142.28 → 4144.70] and he never ended up playing it.
[4144.80 → 4145.98] Not because he didn't want to play it
[4145.98 → 4146.88] but because he couldn't.
[4147.48 → 4148.62] Did he run into that problem?
[4148.70 → 4148.88] Yeah.
[4149.36 → 4150.62] Like it's just...
[4150.62 → 4152.12] I forget what the solution was.
[4152.20 → 4153.50] I haven't touched the game in a long time.
[4153.52 → 4153.84] It's just...
[4153.84 → 4154.80] It was so much work
[4154.80 → 4155.90] and eventually he's just like,
[4155.98 → 4156.16] whatever.
[4156.88 → 4158.80] I don't have that much time to sit down and play games
[4158.80 → 4160.10] because he worked a lot at the time.
[4160.40 → 4161.06] Well, he still does.
[4161.64 → 4162.30] So he's like,
[4162.34 → 4163.78] I'll just play something else.
[4164.02 → 4164.22] Alright.
[4164.68 → 4167.06] So there were rumours floating around
[4167.06 → 4169.64] that Kalman filed for bankruptcy.
[4169.64 → 4174.22] However, they have sort of spoken up now
[4174.22 → 4175.08] and there's going to be
[4175.08 → 4176.20] some kind of official statement
[4176.20 → 4177.00] at some point here.
[4177.34 → 4178.02] But what they're saying is,
[4178.12 → 4178.82] well, hold on a second.
[4178.90 → 4180.38] No, our business is fine.
[4180.92 → 4182.54] It's the parent company,
[4183.14 → 4183.54] Mo nail.
[4183.90 → 4185.52] I used to know how to pronounce this
[4185.52 → 4188.42] because NCI brought in a bunch of cases
[4188.42 → 4190.72] from them like four years ago
[4190.72 → 4191.66] or something like that
[4191.66 → 4193.24] and it was like a super amazing deal
[4193.24 → 4194.12] or something.
[4194.20 → 4194.38] Anyway.
[4194.38 → 4197.84] So it's actually their parent company
[4197.84 → 4203.26] that allegedly is suspected of taking loans
[4203.26 → 4204.44] that it could not repay
[4204.44 → 4206.80] and then fabricating export documents
[4206.80 → 4208.20] to inflate its perceived value
[4208.20 → 4209.70] and get approval on large loans.
[4209.82 → 4210.60] Apparently they're in debt.
[4210.70 → 4213.04] 2.98 billion US or something like that.
[4213.46 → 4215.24] An unnamed employee reports
[4215.24 → 4216.52] that the management team
[4216.52 → 4218.92] was behind the fabrication.
[4218.92 → 4221.00] And so yeah,
[4221.22 → 4223.86] apparently Kalman may still come out of this okay.
[4223.94 → 4224.20] Remember,
[4224.32 → 4225.42] just because the parent company
[4225.42 → 4226.16] is out of money
[4226.16 → 4227.24] and like bad people
[4227.24 → 4228.58] doesn't mean that Kalman
[4228.58 → 4230.26] couldn't be acquired by someone else
[4230.26 → 4231.56] and then continue doing business
[4231.56 → 4232.24] the way that they're doing it.
[4232.26 → 4233.28] So if you're a Kalman fan,
[4233.82 → 4235.92] just kind of relax for a little bit
[4235.92 → 4237.70] and let's see what comes of all of this.
[4237.70 → 4240.10] Very, very possibly still be totally fine.
[4240.88 → 4241.42] All right.
[4241.46 → 4242.86] I really wish I could screen share
[4242.86 → 4243.76] for this next one.
[4243.94 → 4244.82] Amazon Echo,
[4245.30 → 4247.30] the like least useful thing
[4247.30 → 4249.32] that I've talked about today.
[4250.42 → 4252.68] So my comment was that
[4252.68 → 4253.78] it's for people that,
[4254.80 → 4255.58] what is that?
[4255.68 → 4256.50] My comment is that
[4256.50 → 4257.94] it's for people that don't have
[4257.94 → 4259.04] like an old phone
[4259.04 → 4260.40] that they can put on a speaker dock
[4260.40 → 4262.10] and leave there forever.
[4262.28 → 4263.62] And your comment was.
[4265.34 → 4266.48] Oh, my comment was that
[4266.48 → 4268.08] it's for people who don't have a phone.
[4268.08 → 4268.64] At all.
[4268.84 → 4269.16] At all.
[4269.62 → 4271.06] So basically,
[4271.76 → 4275.70] it's like it's Google Now or Siri,
[4275.70 → 4277.14] except it's a device
[4277.14 → 4278.28] that sits on your desk
[4278.28 → 4279.38] and plugs into the wall
[4279.38 → 4280.32] instead of just being
[4280.32 → 4281.48] in your pocket all the time.
[4281.54 → 4282.16] You don't move it around.
[4283.16 → 4284.94] It's like it's not even battery powered.
[4285.22 → 4286.66] So that's why I was thinking
[4286.66 → 4287.84] like if you had an old phone
[4287.84 → 4288.64] and a speaker dock,
[4288.76 → 4290.16] you just create this thing.
[4290.62 → 4291.56] So the speaker dock
[4291.56 → 4293.00] is because the built-in speakers
[4293.00 → 4294.06] on the phone are probably crap
[4294.06 → 4295.38] and this is probably better than it.
[4295.62 → 4295.74] Yeah.
[4295.74 → 4296.46] If you had a speaker dock,
[4296.54 → 4297.74] you could easily get speakers
[4297.74 → 4299.16] that are way better than this thing.
[4299.32 → 4299.60] Okay.
[4299.70 → 4300.58] And then just use Google Now.
[4300.58 → 4301.62] So let's go through what it does.
[4301.70 → 4304.04] It's $200 or $100 if you're on Prime
[4304.04 → 4304.90] for a limited time.
[4305.14 → 4306.00] And it's a speaker.
[4306.22 → 4307.22] So you talk to it
[4307.22 → 4307.86] and you say,
[4308.04 → 4309.16] what's the keyword?
[4309.44 → 4311.44] Like Six or something like that?
[4311.68 → 4313.38] I thought it was like some chick's name.
[4313.50 → 4313.88] Alexa.
[4314.22 → 4314.48] Alexa.
[4314.48 → 4314.66] Okay.
[4314.70 → 4316.44] So you say Alexa to address it.
[4316.44 → 4317.66] Six, E-fax, Alexa.
[4317.90 → 4318.64] They're close.
[4319.12 → 4321.60] So information, music, news, weather,
[4321.68 → 4323.42] and more instantly
[4323.42 → 4325.12] or at least as long as it takes
[4325.12 → 4325.76] for you to say,
[4326.90 → 4327.30] Alexa,
[4327.80 → 4329.00] can you please play some
[4329.00 → 4330.08] One Direction for me?
[4330.20 → 4331.48] Because that's not faster
[4331.48 → 4334.42] than just being like blah, blah, blah
[4334.42 → 4335.10] on your phone.
[4336.70 → 4338.16] It's controlled by your voice
[4338.16 → 4339.26] for hands-free convenience.
[4339.62 → 4339.96] Okay.
[4340.36 → 4341.10] Voice recognition.
[4341.24 → 4342.24] Here's you from across the room.
[4342.32 → 4343.76] So far we've got three bullet points
[4343.76 → 4344.76] that are all the same thing
[4344.76 → 4345.72] as far as I can tell.
[4345.98 → 4347.56] And then it's connected to the cloud
[4347.56 → 4349.26] so it's always getting smarter.
[4349.46 → 4351.02] Now, I do have to say this.
[4351.14 → 4351.68] I funded,
[4351.90 → 4352.96] I don't know if you remember this,
[4353.06 → 4354.42] that stupid robot thing
[4354.42 → 4355.54] that I funded on Kickstarter.
[4355.54 → 4358.08] Um, I funded that
[4358.08 → 4359.98] just because I wanted to get it
[4359.98 → 4361.82] and it was going to be like a PSA
[4361.82 → 4363.88] about how bloody stupid crowdfunding is.
[4364.00 → 4365.18] By the time I ever get it,
[4365.28 → 4366.92] that whole message will be dead and gone
[4366.92 → 4367.88] just like crowdfunding.
[4368.26 → 4371.38] Oh, oh, oh, oh, wrecked.
[4371.48 → 4372.90] It'll be like a retro unboxing.
[4373.06 → 4375.26] An unboxing of why crowdfunding failed.
[4376.56 → 4378.74] Um, if they ever even deliver it.
[4378.86 → 4380.28] It'll be like a mini-documentary
[4380.28 → 4381.18] on why crowdfunding.
[4381.30 → 4382.36] So the reason I think
[4382.36 → 4383.20] that one's going to fail
[4383.20 → 4384.34] is because it's supposed to do
[4384.34 → 4386.42] all this stuff interactively with you.
[4386.46 → 4387.58] And they're such a small company.
[4387.72 → 4389.16] They just don't have the resources
[4389.16 → 4389.80] to do it properly.
[4389.94 → 4390.70] Amazon might.
[4391.02 → 4392.36] So the fact that it's going to continue
[4392.36 → 4393.82] to learn as time goes on
[4393.82 → 4394.80] might be somewhat useful.
[4395.30 → 4397.26] But I just don't see it being
[4397.26 → 4398.28] any more useful
[4398.28 → 4400.02] than something like Google Now
[4400.02 → 4400.92] or Siri,
[4401.16 → 4402.86] which are already going to be connected
[4402.86 → 4405.46] much, much more tightly
[4405.46 → 4407.80] with the rest of your digital life
[4407.80 → 4409.36] and the rest of your smart home
[4409.36 → 4411.86] and smart car stuff
[4411.86 → 4413.58] the way that your phone will.
[4413.58 → 4414.68] So it's got Wi-Fi
[4414.68 → 4415.88] and Bluetooth connectivity.
[4416.06 → 4417.52] So it could be in theory
[4417.52 → 4418.42] connected very well,
[4418.50 → 4419.42] but probably won't be
[4419.42 → 4420.24] because this is probably
[4420.24 → 4422.02] some weird project
[4422.02 → 4423.08] that's just going to go away.
[4423.20 → 4424.14] I'll be floored
[4424.14 → 4425.20] if we ever see an Echo 2.
[4426.08 → 4427.54] And it's got seven mics.
[4427.54 → 4428.00] Well, it depends on
[4428.00 → 4429.24] if they still have Fire phones left.
[4430.34 → 4430.84] Oh, yeah.
[4430.98 → 4431.90] The joke.
[4432.16 → 4433.90] The joke going around on the web
[4433.90 → 4435.50] is that's what they're doing
[4435.50 → 4437.10] with all the Fire phone hardware.
[4438.54 → 4439.86] Which I find hilarious.
[4440.12 → 4440.30] Yeah.
[4440.30 → 4441.60] Because it might be accurate.
[4441.92 → 4444.08] So it's got seven beam-forming microphones
[4444.08 → 4445.44] with great noise cancellation.
[4445.74 → 4446.84] So even if it's playing music,
[4446.94 → 4447.68] it can still hear you
[4447.68 → 4448.52] from across the room,
[4448.64 → 4449.86] which I guess is neat,
[4449.94 → 4450.60] except that my phone
[4450.60 → 4451.38] doesn't have to hear me
[4451.38 → 4452.06] from across the room
[4452.06 → 4453.00] because I'm already holding it.
[4453.40 → 4454.96] And my smartwatch,
[4455.34 → 4456.46] I can also talk to,
[4456.84 → 4457.74] although I'm not actually
[4457.74 → 4459.80] a huge fan of the Moto 360 so far.
[4459.90 → 4460.32] But again,
[4460.40 → 4461.38] I've only spent a day with it,
[4461.46 → 4462.92] so lots of time for that to change.
[4465.68 → 4466.96] Advanced audio design.
[4466.96 → 4469.66] And it has a massive 2.5-inch subwoofer.
[4475.24 → 4476.98] I'm a huge proponent
[4476.98 → 4478.14] for voice control stuff.
[4478.84 → 4479.82] Not that interested.
[4480.76 → 4482.28] Like, I've been toying
[4482.28 → 4483.64] with this idea for a while
[4483.64 → 4485.04] where if I set up a server
[4485.04 → 4487.68] that had dragon speaking on it,
[4488.12 → 4490.08] I could have...
[4490.08 → 4491.64] This is going to take me a sec,
[4491.72 → 4492.26] but this is something
[4492.26 → 4493.22] I've been playing with for a while.
[4493.42 → 4493.96] Right now,
[4494.00 → 4494.74] it's just too expensive
[4494.74 → 4495.60] to properly do.
[4496.02 → 4496.72] Hold on, hold on.
[4496.78 → 4497.32] Can I jump in
[4497.32 → 4498.12] before you do it then?
[4498.30 → 4498.54] Yes.
[4499.46 → 4499.78] Warts?
[4500.00 → 4500.24] Warts?
[4500.60 → 4501.56] Will the Echo 2
[4501.56 → 4502.72] be called the Echo?
[4503.50 → 4503.86] Hopefully.
[4506.32 → 4507.20] And the Echo 3
[4507.20 → 4508.86] will be the Echo Echo Echo.
[4509.90 → 4510.68] Sorry, go ahead.
[4510.82 → 4512.04] I want to set up an array
[4512.04 → 4513.44] of little microphones
[4513.44 → 4515.98] like all around my place
[4515.98 → 4517.56] and then have a
[4517.56 → 4518.62] like little central server
[4518.62 → 4519.14] that has something
[4519.14 → 4519.88] like dragon speaking
[4519.88 → 4520.60] hooked up to it
[4520.60 → 4521.60] so that I can just,
[4521.84 → 4523.04] it can pick up whatever
[4523.04 → 4524.38] and just look for keywords
[4524.38 → 4527.24] and then if I say like
[4527.24 → 4529.14] play music,
[4530.46 → 4531.76] some band.
[4532.08 → 4532.56] One Direction.
[4532.76 → 4534.36] One, I don't have any of that,
[4534.42 → 4534.70] but sure.
[4534.78 → 4535.24] Sure you don't.
[4537.80 → 4538.20] Anyway,
[4538.48 → 4539.40] it would be able to
[4539.40 → 4540.24] pick that up
[4540.24 → 4541.22] and then actually
[4541.22 → 4542.22] just do that
[4542.22 → 4542.64] and I could have
[4542.64 → 4543.96] like a library of keywords
[4543.96 → 4544.98] that I set up
[4544.98 → 4546.26] and program
[4546.26 → 4547.36] and tell them what to do.
[4547.50 → 4548.22] That could actually
[4548.22 → 4548.90] be really cool.
[4549.22 → 4549.96] The reason why
[4549.96 → 4551.26] I would like that setup
[4551.26 → 4552.42] is I could be anywhere.
[4554.04 → 4555.26] And like this thing,
[4555.44 → 4556.04] I don't care about
[4556.04 → 4557.08] their stupid server microphones.
[4557.18 → 4557.58] You're not going to be able
[4557.58 → 4558.92] to be anywhere in your house
[4558.92 → 4560.16] and have it work.
[4560.26 → 4560.76] You'd have to be
[4560.76 → 4561.90] like within that room.
[4562.36 → 4563.08] Maybe you don't have to be
[4563.08 → 4563.88] as close to get
[4563.88 → 4564.88] your phone to work
[4564.88 → 4565.98] although to be completely honest,
[4566.04 → 4567.54] if I just talk loud enough,
[4568.00 → 4569.60] my phone can usually pick up
[4569.60 → 4571.64] if I call for it.
[4571.82 → 4572.88] That's how I find it sometimes.
[4572.96 → 4574.06] This is one of those products
[4574.06 → 4576.20] that I just don't get
[4576.20 → 4578.58] because like the cynic in me,
[4578.70 → 4579.54] if it was a company
[4579.54 → 4580.76] that's smaller than Amazon,
[4580.76 → 4581.96] I would kind of go,
[4582.22 → 4582.40] okay,
[4582.44 → 4583.44] they're trying to fund
[4583.44 → 4584.26] the next wave
[4584.26 → 4585.66] by selling a bunch
[4585.66 → 4586.42] of these things
[4586.42 → 4586.98] that ultimately
[4586.98 → 4587.76] they have to know
[4587.76 → 4588.52] are going to be useless
[4588.52 → 4590.12] because ultimately
[4590.12 → 4590.82] as,
[4591.20 → 4592.94] so let's look at the five year
[4592.94 → 4593.76] or the 10-year outlook.
[4593.98 → 4594.14] You know,
[4594.16 → 4594.54] when you've got
[4594.54 → 4595.46] your Nest thermostat
[4595.46 → 4596.22] and you've got
[4596.22 → 4597.68] your self-locking,
[4597.74 → 4598.10] what is it?
[4598.16 → 4598.78] Genie door?
[4599.10 → 4599.60] I forget what
[4599.60 → 4601.38] that smart door lock is
[4601.38 → 4602.58] and you've got all this crap
[4602.58 → 4603.22] and your house starts
[4603.22 → 4604.70] to get way more smart
[4604.70 → 4605.70] and way more connected
[4605.70 → 4607.70] with Internet of Things stuff
[4607.70 → 4608.80] just kind of naturally
[4608.80 → 4609.38] over time
[4609.38 → 4610.34] because it happens
[4610.34 → 4611.40] no matter what you want
[4611.40 → 4612.14] because ultimately
[4612.14 → 4612.62] you're going to,
[4612.66 → 4613.22] you're going to go
[4613.22 → 4614.24] to Best Buy one day
[4614.24 → 4615.52] to buy a dishwasher
[4615.52 → 4616.82] and every,
[4616.98 → 4618.46] it's going to be $20 more
[4618.46 → 4619.68] for the smart connected model
[4619.68 → 4620.22] and you might as well
[4620.22 → 4620.76] just get it.
[4621.10 → 4622.90] So it just happens over time.
[4623.08 → 4623.20] Yeah.
[4623.30 → 4624.46] And so this device
[4624.46 → 4625.86] will never be useful for that
[4625.86 → 4627.26] because as,
[4627.42 → 4629.84] as the idea gets bigger
[4629.84 → 4630.44] and the functionality
[4630.44 → 4631.12] gets bigger,
[4631.20 → 4631.98] the idea of something
[4631.98 → 4632.98] that sits on your desk
[4632.98 → 4633.56] is going to look
[4633.56 → 4634.70] even more stupid
[4634.70 → 4635.62] as everyday passes.
[4635.62 → 4637.32] So I would look at it
[4637.32 → 4637.64] and I would go,
[4637.78 → 4637.88] okay,
[4637.90 → 4638.42] they're just trying
[4638.42 → 4639.08] to get some money
[4639.08 → 4640.88] to fund the actual product
[4640.88 → 4643.28] but what's Amazon's excuse?
[4643.90 → 4645.16] Because they could afford
[4645.16 → 4646.82] to just keep developing this
[4646.82 → 4647.36] and keep,
[4647.36 → 4649.02] keep working on it
[4649.02 → 4649.92] until something's
[4649.92 → 4650.72] actually ready.
[4651.70 → 4652.40] Amazon doesn't seem
[4652.40 → 4653.60] to be doing super well
[4653.60 → 4655.04] with the hardware stuff.
[4656.24 → 4657.02] Kindle's great.
[4657.68 → 4657.96] Okay,
[4658.06 → 4658.40] I take that back.
[4658.40 → 4658.86] Maybe their,
[4658.86 → 4660.30] their Kindle hubris
[4660.30 → 4661.14] led them to believe
[4661.14 → 4662.16] that people wanted something
[4662.16 → 4662.74] other than a way
[4662.74 → 4663.62] to read books from them.
[4663.78 → 4664.02] Yeah.
[4664.02 → 4664.74] Like,
[4664.84 → 4666.66] your phone sucks
[4666.66 → 4667.56] and this Echo thing
[4667.56 → 4668.04] is stupid
[4668.04 → 4669.30] and you should feel bad.
[4671.60 → 4672.08] Oh,
[4672.12 → 4673.10] I've got someone saying,
[4673.22 → 4673.48] um,
[4673.82 → 4674.14] Linus,
[4674.18 → 4675.22] I work in HVAC.
[4675.34 → 4676.32] Trust me when I say
[4676.32 → 4677.80] that Nest thermostats
[4677.80 → 4678.52] are a PETA.
[4678.88 → 4679.20] Um,
[4679.20 → 4679.86] I believe you.
[4679.96 → 4680.34] Actually,
[4680.56 → 4682.28] Nest was one of those companies
[4682.28 → 4683.14] that I kind of went,
[4683.66 → 4684.26] really?
[4684.68 → 4686.16] You got acquired by Google
[4686.16 → 4687.36] for a billion dollars?
[4687.46 → 4688.56] Are you freaking kidding me?
[4688.78 → 4689.26] They've had,
[4689.34 → 4689.42] what,
[4689.48 → 4690.90] like three recalls
[4690.90 → 4691.88] in their history?
[4692.52 → 4693.68] Maybe it's only two.
[4693.68 → 4694.62] But they were like
[4694.62 → 4695.68] a big deal.
[4695.90 → 4696.04] Like,
[4696.06 → 4696.64] I think their,
[4696.72 → 4697.72] their smoke detector,
[4697.72 → 4698.48] uh,
[4698.48 → 4699.14] was recalled
[4699.14 → 4700.30] because of something.
[4700.50 → 4701.44] That's not good.
[4701.64 → 4702.80] You don't want your smoke detector
[4702.80 → 4703.10] to be,
[4703.44 → 4703.68] yeah.
[4703.70 → 4704.10] Terrible.
[4704.56 → 4704.74] Like,
[4705.08 → 4705.44] awful.
[4705.72 → 4705.94] Like,
[4706.00 → 4707.26] the amount of crap
[4707.26 → 4708.90] that Nest has gotten away with
[4708.90 → 4710.30] just by being like a
[4710.30 → 4711.76] like a Silicon Valley
[4711.76 → 4713.22] connected
[4713.22 → 4715.18] Web 2.0 company
[4715.18 → 4716.64] is just mind-boggling to me.
[4716.64 → 4717.98] And the idea
[4717.98 → 4718.72] that you need
[4718.72 → 4719.60] a smart thermostat
[4719.60 → 4721.02] is still just kind of
[4721.02 → 4721.72] baffling to me.
[4722.12 → 4723.42] I have a smart thermostat.
[4723.74 → 4724.40] It's called,
[4725.04 → 4726.14] I program it
[4726.14 → 4727.30] to maintain the temperature
[4727.30 → 4727.94] in my house
[4727.94 → 4729.18] at a certain threshold.
[4729.52 → 4731.22] And if I'm leaving the house
[4731.22 → 4732.34] for like,
[4732.40 → 4732.90] the weekend,
[4733.06 → 4734.04] I turn it off.
[4735.14 → 4735.76] And then,
[4736.04 → 4737.52] it comes back on automatically
[4737.52 → 4739.30] because you have a schedule
[4739.30 → 4739.88] for it.
[4740.96 → 4741.48] Like,
[4741.48 → 4743.64] not a big deal.
[4744.14 → 4744.50] And I,
[4744.50 → 4745.74] I get that some people
[4745.74 → 4746.94] might save a lot of power
[4746.94 → 4748.12] if they keep their house
[4748.12 → 4749.58] at 28 degrees Celsius
[4749.58 → 4750.48] or whatever else.
[4750.72 → 4751.22] It's like,
[4751.26 → 4751.38] yeah,
[4751.40 → 4752.44] we have the sauna house
[4752.44 → 4753.44] so we only want to heat it
[4753.44 → 4754.14] when we're actually,
[4754.62 → 4755.00] you know,
[4755.20 → 4756.48] running around naked.
[4756.66 → 4756.92] Or no,
[4757.02 → 4758.04] not running around naked,
[4758.50 → 4759.34] lounging naked.
[4759.50 → 4759.82] There you go.
[4759.82 → 4760.40] Because if we were running
[4760.40 → 4761.48] we'd be generating enough.
[4761.48 → 4762.10] Yeah, yeah.
[4764.54 → 4765.82] Maybe one of these days
[4765.82 → 4766.82] I'll try a Nest
[4766.82 → 4768.16] and then I'll,
[4768.20 → 4769.14] I'll tell you guys,
[4769.26 → 4769.72] holy crap,
[4769.78 → 4770.22] I was wrong.
[4770.28 → 4770.84] It's revolutionary
[4770.84 → 4771.76] but for now
[4771.76 → 4772.40] it feels like
[4772.40 → 4772.88] one of those things
[4772.88 → 4773.62] I don't really need.
[4774.06 → 4774.86] It also doesn't help
[4774.86 → 4775.46] that my house
[4775.46 → 4776.60] only has two wires
[4776.60 → 4777.42] running to my thermostat
[4777.42 → 4778.46] so I'm not even Nest
[4778.46 → 4779.10] compatible
[4779.10 → 4780.54] unless I wanted to run wires
[4780.54 → 4781.62] through my wall
[4781.62 → 4782.20] which would involve
[4782.20 → 4783.00] tearing up my wall.
[4783.00 → 4783.66] Which does not sound like fun.
[4783.94 → 4784.76] Which is not happening.
[4784.82 → 4786.04] Let's not do that.
[4786.44 → 4786.78] Alright,
[4787.26 → 4788.46] what else we got here?
[4788.74 → 4789.32] That's I think
[4789.32 → 4790.14] most of the like
[4790.14 → 4790.98] huge topics
[4790.98 → 4791.46] this week,
[4791.58 → 4792.12] isn't it?
[4792.30 → 4792.70] Yeah,
[4792.86 → 4794.50] we have some rapid fiery stuff.
[4794.64 → 4795.82] We have that dude's man cave
[4795.82 → 4796.56] which we can't show
[4796.56 → 4797.14] because we don't have
[4797.14 → 4798.36] screen sharing working.
[4799.14 → 4800.02] Future Mark.
[4800.04 → 4800.74] We can go look at it.
[4800.84 → 4802.30] Acquired by UL.
[4802.44 → 4803.62] That's a big deal, actually.
[4803.84 → 4805.52] So UL are the guys
[4805.52 → 4807.12] that have like a little logo.
[4808.02 → 4808.84] Not this one.
[4808.96 → 4810.40] You'll find it on a lot of different...
[4810.40 → 4811.46] But the charger for this
[4811.46 → 4812.76] will definitely have a UL logo.
[4812.76 → 4813.38] Electronic-y stuff.
[4813.54 → 4813.68] Yeah,
[4813.76 → 4814.40] so basically
[4814.40 → 4816.52] they do certification and testing.
[4816.90 → 4817.86] Really important stuff
[4817.86 → 4818.42] that they do.
[4818.58 → 4818.90] Really,
[4819.04 → 4819.56] perfect
[4819.56 → 4820.04] so that,
[4820.10 → 4820.34] you know,
[4820.40 → 4821.64] your iPhone charger
[4821.64 → 4822.52] doesn't light on fire.
[4822.62 → 4823.70] That's the kind of stuff they do
[4823.70 → 4825.60] and that's why
[4825.60 → 4826.96] buying cheapo stuff
[4826.96 → 4828.54] that's not certified by UL
[4828.54 → 4829.82] can be a little bit risky
[4829.82 → 4832.34] because they do a great job.
[4832.34 → 4832.72] Yeah.
[4832.72 → 4834.88] And they acquired Future Mark,
[4835.00 → 4836.22] the makers of PC Mark
[4836.22 → 4837.20] and 3D Mark
[4837.20 → 4837.86] with the intention
[4837.86 → 4839.18] of branching into,
[4839.74 → 4840.22] well,
[4840.38 → 4841.12] basically just,
[4841.18 → 4841.84] I guess,
[4841.94 → 4845.16] adding another testing benchmark.
[4845.42 → 4845.80] Essentially,
[4845.94 → 4846.18] it's just,
[4846.26 → 4847.08] it's a software benchmark.
[4847.08 → 4847.80] Yeah, yeah.
[4847.80 → 4848.68] So Future Mark
[4848.68 → 4849.34] has been developing
[4849.34 → 4849.94] all kinds of stuff.
[4850.00 → 4850.66] In the old days,
[4850.74 → 4851.98] it was just 3D Mark.
[4852.08 → 4853.14] You tested graphics cards
[4853.14 → 4853.72] and that was it.
[4854.06 → 4854.70] And then they were like,
[4854.76 → 4854.92] oh,
[4854.98 → 4855.12] well,
[4855.18 → 4855.36] you know,
[4855.40 → 4856.42] maybe 3D Mark
[4856.42 → 4856.96] can,
[4857.22 → 4857.62] you know,
[4857.72 → 4858.54] also test,
[4858.58 → 4858.88] like,
[4859.04 → 4860.22] physics on your graphics card.
[4860.28 → 4860.38] Well,
[4860.38 → 4860.88] hold on a second.
[4860.96 → 4861.96] Maybe we'll make PC Mark
[4861.96 → 4863.02] and it'll test your whole PC.
[4863.40 → 4864.10] And then they've got
[4864.10 → 4865.10] mobile phone stuff
[4865.10 → 4865.22] and,
[4865.38 → 4866.22] all this crazy stuff.
[4866.32 → 4866.42] Like,
[4866.44 → 4867.22] that's great!
[4867.36 → 4867.52] Yeah.
[4867.64 → 4868.96] Having a big company
[4868.96 → 4869.88] like UL
[4869.88 → 4871.26] behind Future Mark,
[4871.40 → 4872.22] turning it into
[4872.22 → 4873.24] something that really
[4873.24 → 4874.44] could be
[4874.44 → 4875.56] more than just this,
[4875.66 → 4875.76] like,
[4875.88 → 4876.20] weird,
[4876.32 → 4876.50] like,
[4876.56 → 4877.64] IT industry standard,
[4877.80 → 4878.20] like,
[4878.24 → 4879.20] if you could go to
[4879.20 → 4879.92] Best Buy
[4879.92 → 4881.02] and the PCs
[4881.02 → 4881.66] would be sorted
[4881.66 → 4882.50] by Future Mark
[4882.50 → 4883.32] score
[4883.32 → 4884.28] or something like that,
[4884.32 → 4885.38] that's so much more meaningful.
[4885.46 → 4886.04] It's not perfect
[4886.04 → 4887.36] at all.
[4887.52 → 4888.94] But it's so much more meaningful
[4888.94 → 4889.78] than megahertz
[4889.78 → 4891.24] that I see it as a huge step
[4891.24 → 4891.88] in the right direction.
[4892.00 → 4892.56] I think it's awesome.
[4893.32 → 4894.46] Should we wreck
[4894.46 → 4897.04] Ubisoft for a little bit?
[4897.36 → 4897.60] Sure.
[4897.76 → 4897.94] Yeah,
[4897.98 → 4898.70] I'll let you do it.
[4899.34 → 4899.58] Wait,
[4899.64 → 4901.20] can I do the gold Apple Watch first?
[4901.38 → 4901.64] Yes.
[4901.92 → 4902.12] Okay,
[4902.16 → 4903.36] so the gold Apple Watch
[4903.36 → 4905.24] estimated to cost $5,000.
[4905.68 → 4906.42] This is a rumour.
[4906.42 → 4907.20] This was posted by
[4907.20 → 4908.56] Pit5000 on the forum
[4908.56 → 4909.72] and it is rumoured
[4909.72 → 4910.46] that it will debut
[4910.46 → 4912.20] on February 14th,
[4912.30 → 4912.98] Valentine's Day.
[4913.26 → 4914.16] Probably not an accident.
[4914.86 → 4915.68] 5,000...
[4915.68 → 4916.14] Rose gold.
[4916.48 → 4916.78] Oh,
[4916.94 → 4917.24] snap.
[4918.38 → 4918.78] Oh,
[4919.66 → 4920.04] snap.
[4921.00 → 4921.50] Get it?
[4922.98 → 4923.34] Roses?
[4924.08 → 4924.32] Oh,
[4924.36 → 4925.10] I thought you meant rose
[4925.10 → 4926.50] because the price went up a lot
[4926.50 → 4927.26] from what people thought
[4927.26 → 4927.64] it would be.
[4928.00 → 4928.24] Oh,
[4929.42 → 4929.86] snap.
[4930.76 → 4931.44] We're awful.
[4931.44 → 4932.08] We are.
[4932.82 → 4933.22] So,
[4933.46 → 4934.50] rumoured to be $5,000
[4934.50 → 4935.60] for gold edition.
[4935.74 → 4936.72] It's unclear whether
[4936.72 → 4937.70] they're solid or plated,
[4937.84 → 4938.80] but let me tell you guys,
[4938.90 → 4939.38] it's Apple.
[4939.54 → 4940.00] It's plated.
[4940.88 → 4942.26] And $500
[4942.26 → 4943.64] for the steel version
[4943.64 → 4944.84] with the sport version,
[4945.14 → 4945.84] which was rumoured
[4945.84 → 4946.46] to be
[4946.46 → 4947.58] sort of like
[4947.58 → 4949.52] just the tip
[4949.52 → 4950.10] of the iceberg
[4950.10 → 4951.10] in terms of pricing
[4951.10 → 4952.38] that they unveiled
[4952.38 → 4953.22] being the
[4953.22 → 4954.34] the lowest cost
[4954.34 → 4955.30] version.
[4955.74 → 4956.26] It's rumoured
[4956.26 → 4957.36] to be 18-karat gold
[4957.36 → 4959.06] with sapphire crystal glass
[4959.06 → 4959.94] and come with a variety
[4959.94 → 4960.66] of luxurious
[4960.66 → 4961.68] strap options.
[4962.04 → 4962.72] It's unclear.
[4962.88 → 4963.00] Oh,
[4963.10 → 4963.26] okay,
[4963.32 → 4964.14] so I just said that.
[4964.86 → 4965.16] So,
[4965.64 → 4966.40] to all the people
[4966.40 → 4967.16] kind of running around
[4967.16 → 4967.48] going,
[4967.74 → 4968.90] Apple is overpriced
[4968.90 → 4970.10] and that's totally unreasonable.
[4970.46 → 4971.36] Shut up.
[4973.04 → 4973.56] Watches
[4973.56 → 4974.60] are overpriced.
[4974.60 → 4974.82] Yeah.
[4975.18 → 4976.24] And watch pricing
[4976.24 → 4977.30] is unreasonable.
[4977.60 → 4977.74] Yeah.
[4977.82 → 4978.82] For once,
[4979.18 → 4980.58] it is not
[4980.58 → 4981.44] Apple
[4981.44 → 4982.78] setting the precedent here.
[4983.22 → 4984.44] They are just
[4984.44 → 4986.18] expanding into a market
[4986.18 → 4987.28] that is already
[4987.28 → 4988.64] charging way too much
[4988.64 → 4989.64] if you look at it
[4989.64 → 4990.92] from a bill of materials
[4990.92 → 4992.78] cost perspective.
[4993.58 → 4993.82] So,
[4994.56 → 4995.46] nothing new.
[4995.92 → 4996.82] Move along.
[4997.20 → 4997.92] $5,000
[4997.92 → 4999.48] for a high-end watch
[4999.48 → 5000.28] is like
[5000.28 → 5002.12] nothing to see here,
[5002.20 → 5002.58] guys.
[5003.04 → 5003.66] Me personally,
[5003.96 → 5005.20] I think it's ridiculous.
[5005.46 → 5005.62] Oh, yeah.
[5005.68 → 5006.38] I'd never buy one.
[5006.52 → 5007.20] There's lots of people
[5007.20 → 5007.54] that do.
[5007.70 → 5008.68] Never buy one.
[5009.40 → 5010.04] Lots of relative.
[5010.54 → 5011.54] Lots of people do.
[5011.68 → 5012.00] In fact,
[5012.10 → 5012.66] even like
[5012.66 → 5013.38] otherwise,
[5013.62 → 5014.52] like normal people
[5014.52 → 5015.68] who have real jobs
[5015.68 → 5016.92] might own a Rolex
[5016.92 → 5018.16] because that
[5018.16 → 5019.82] particular status symbol
[5019.82 → 5020.54] of a watch
[5020.54 → 5021.34] is very,
[5021.46 → 5022.08] very important to them.
[5022.32 → 5023.00] The one thing
[5023.00 → 5023.72] that I have to say
[5023.72 → 5024.40] about this
[5024.40 → 5025.12] is
[5025.12 → 5025.88] Apple,
[5026.96 → 5027.84] do this right.
[5028.50 → 5029.62] Even if the hardware
[5029.62 → 5030.54] changes
[5030.54 → 5032.58] on a very rapid basis,
[5032.86 → 5033.60] you cannot
[5033.60 → 5034.34] treat
[5034.34 → 5036.02] a $5,000 watch
[5036.02 → 5036.80] the same way
[5036.80 → 5037.46] that you do
[5037.46 → 5038.82] something relatively
[5038.82 → 5039.44] disposable,
[5039.86 → 5040.96] like even at $1,000,
[5041.68 → 5042.36] a smartphone.
[5042.70 → 5044.14] Because if they roll out
[5044.14 → 5045.04] a new iteration
[5045.04 → 5046.24] that is dramatically
[5046.24 → 5047.32] better than the old one
[5047.32 → 5048.06] every year
[5048.06 → 5049.06] at $5,000,
[5049.54 → 5050.52] even people
[5050.52 → 5051.38] with $5,000
[5051.38 → 5052.44] to spend on a watch
[5052.44 → 5053.78] are going to get pissed.
[5055.06 → 5055.72] So there.
[5055.94 → 5056.44] That's true.
[5056.62 → 5057.00] Tim Cook,
[5057.04 → 5057.68] I hope you're listening.
[5059.36 → 5059.76] No.
[5060.62 → 5061.28] One thing,
[5061.62 → 5062.84] the deal you did
[5062.84 → 5063.54] with your glasses
[5063.54 → 5064.38] so that you got
[5064.38 → 5064.78] your glasses,
[5064.88 → 5065.42] what was that deal?
[5065.50 → 5066.08] Like you had to
[5066.08 → 5067.12] have a certain pair
[5067.12 → 5067.78] and not lose them
[5067.78 → 5068.18] or something?
[5068.54 → 5068.90] Oh,
[5069.02 → 5070.76] with my Oakley's.
[5071.02 → 5071.48] Yeah, yeah.
[5071.62 → 5073.06] So I'm a bit
[5073.06 → 5073.62] of a cheapskate.
[5073.68 → 5074.12] I'm also a bit
[5074.12 → 5074.80] of a scatterbrain.
[5074.90 → 5075.80] So the deal
[5075.80 → 5076.66] that my wife
[5076.66 → 5077.64] actually made with me
[5077.64 → 5078.92] was you can get
[5078.92 → 5079.84] nice sunglasses,
[5080.10 → 5080.76] like the kind
[5080.76 → 5082.26] with polarized lenses
[5082.26 → 5084.58] and like shatter-resistant lenses
[5084.58 → 5085.92] that look good
[5085.92 → 5086.62] and feel good
[5086.62 → 5087.10] and are like
[5087.10 → 5088.30] a couple of hundred bucks
[5088.30 → 5090.16] if you get some
[5090.16 → 5091.56] like cheapo foster grants
[5091.56 → 5092.34] at the drugstore
[5092.34 → 5093.54] and can manage
[5093.54 → 5094.40] to not lose those
[5094.40 → 5095.16] for a few months.
[5095.72 → 5096.86] And so I did
[5096.86 → 5097.74] and it was actually
[5097.74 → 5098.86] an excellent exercise
[5098.86 → 5099.96] in being very conscious
[5099.96 → 5100.72] of having a goal
[5100.72 → 5101.44] to work towards
[5101.44 → 5102.26] to not lose it.
[5102.74 → 5103.84] And then I did end up
[5103.84 → 5104.56] earning my awesome
[5104.56 → 5104.96] sunglasses
[5104.96 → 5106.08] that I have now
[5106.08 → 5106.90] never lost
[5106.90 → 5107.46] even though I used
[5107.46 → 5108.04] to lose glasses
[5108.04 → 5108.62] all the time.
[5108.76 → 5109.46] I will not have
[5109.46 → 5110.48] a super nice watch
[5110.48 → 5112.02] because
[5112.02 → 5113.18] and maybe I'll redo
[5113.18 → 5114.02] this at some time
[5114.02 → 5115.04] but when I was younger
[5115.04 → 5116.12] I went to the store
[5116.12 → 5117.16] and bought a fairly cheap one
[5117.16 → 5117.86] and lost it within
[5117.86 → 5118.52] like a week
[5118.52 → 5119.18] and then was like
[5119.18 → 5120.00] I will never have
[5120.00 → 5120.82] a super nice watch.
[5121.26 → 5121.96] I've done that
[5121.96 → 5123.02] with jewellery as well
[5123.02 → 5123.56] and I'm just like
[5123.56 → 5124.40] I can't just keep
[5124.40 → 5125.28] things on my hands
[5125.28 → 5126.52] because it'll
[5126.52 → 5127.16] be annoying
[5127.16 → 5127.68] because I'll be doing
[5127.68 → 5128.22] something like
[5128.22 → 5129.00] I'll have to pull
[5129.00 → 5129.82] something or do whatever
[5129.82 → 5130.88] and it will never
[5130.88 → 5131.28] come back
[5131.28 → 5132.78] and I know that
[5132.78 → 5133.44] so I will just
[5133.44 → 5134.02] not have one
[5134.02 → 5135.06] and that's fine.
[5135.72 → 5136.38] Well I'll tell you what
[5136.38 → 5136.94] we'll get you
[5136.94 → 5138.44] like a baby's first
[5138.44 → 5139.24] smartwatch
[5139.24 → 5140.22] we'll get you
[5140.22 → 5141.02] a trainer watch
[5141.02 → 5143.56] before you drop
[5143.56 → 5144.24] your five grand
[5144.24 → 5145.12] on a goldmine watch.
[5145.22 → 5146.38] Those little tracking ones
[5146.38 → 5147.14] that the kids get
[5147.14 → 5147.50] from it.
[5147.50 → 5147.96] Yeah no, no
[5147.96 → 5149.02] it shouldn't tell the time
[5149.02 → 5149.74] it's the kind
[5149.74 → 5150.46] with the little balls
[5150.46 → 5150.80] in it
[5150.80 → 5151.56] that you like
[5151.56 → 5152.16] hold in it.
[5154.16 → 5154.78] I'll be like
[5154.78 → 5155.78] look you can game
[5155.78 → 5156.80] on your mobile.
[5156.80 → 5158.26] No one else can game
[5158.26 → 5158.80] on their watch
[5158.80 → 5159.76] I'm like the only person
[5159.76 → 5160.58] that's fantastic.
[5161.08 → 5162.02] I have the highest
[5162.02 → 5163.26] end watch, actually.
[5163.94 → 5164.38] Anyway.
[5164.68 → 5165.18] Okay want to hate
[5165.18 → 5166.12] on Ubisoft for a bit?
[5166.28 → 5166.48] Yeah.
[5166.48 → 5166.74] Hold on.
[5167.06 → 5168.14] I have an actual
[5168.14 → 5169.52] lower third for this.
[5169.84 → 5170.10] You know what
[5170.10 → 5170.82] I'll go find it
[5170.82 → 5171.54] while you work on this.
[5171.62 → 5172.00] Yeah yeah yeah
[5172.00 → 5172.28] it's fine.
[5172.30 → 5173.68] So we can't show you
[5173.68 → 5175.42] which totally sucks
[5175.42 → 5176.96] this topic is posted by
[5176.96 → 5178.42] the future mark topic
[5178.42 → 5179.58] was posted by
[5179.58 → 5180.90] Duck Dodgers
[5180.90 → 5181.84] okay.
[5182.08 → 5182.66] Of course it's fine.
[5182.66 → 5184.70] And then this one
[5184.70 → 5185.28] which is about
[5185.28 → 5186.52] screenshots from
[5186.52 → 5187.24] Assassin's Creed
[5187.24 → 5189.34] PS4 version of
[5189.34 → 5190.14] Unity blah blah blah
[5190.14 → 5192.42] is from Test Stranger.
[5192.94 → 5193.64] By the way
[5193.64 → 5194.20] one of the reasons
[5194.20 → 5194.76] why we might have
[5194.76 → 5195.40] had a little bit
[5195.40 → 5196.40] of a lower user count
[5196.40 → 5197.34] was also because
[5197.34 → 5198.00] there's not only
[5198.00 → 5198.78] Blazon running
[5198.78 → 5199.46] right now
[5199.46 → 5200.38] but also there is
[5200.38 → 5201.22] an Ubisoft stream
[5201.22 → 5201.70] showing off
[5201.70 → 5202.24] Assassin's Creed
[5202.24 → 5202.90] running right now.
[5203.42 → 5204.46] I'm amazed we even
[5204.46 → 5205.60] have 5200 viewers.
[5206.20 → 5206.92] Thank you.
[5207.24 → 5207.40] Yay.
[5207.82 → 5208.96] Thanks for showing up.
[5209.12 → 5210.24] I really appreciate it.
[5210.38 → 5210.84] I do too.
[5211.14 → 5212.14] I'm not super surprised
[5212.14 → 5212.54] that you're not
[5212.54 → 5212.96] watching the
[5212.96 → 5213.76] Assassin's Creed one
[5213.76 → 5215.18] but the Blazon one
[5215.18 → 5215.80] is pretty interesting.
[5216.70 → 5217.62] Reasons why I'm not
[5217.62 → 5218.14] super surprised
[5218.14 → 5218.64] you're not watching
[5218.64 → 5219.40] the Assassin's Creed one
[5219.40 → 5220.52] is I tuned in
[5220.52 → 5221.52] for a little bit
[5221.52 → 5221.96] and was like
[5221.96 → 5222.60] wow this game
[5222.60 → 5223.66] looks ancient.
[5224.28 → 5224.48] What?
[5225.50 → 5227.02] And it's not
[5227.02 → 5229.26] 1080p on PlayStation 4.
[5229.40 → 5230.08] Usually from the
[5230.08 → 5230.58] two consoles
[5230.58 → 5231.84] we see PlayStation 4
[5231.84 → 5233.00] able to step up
[5233.00 → 5233.50] to the plate
[5233.50 → 5234.68] and show off 1080p
[5234.68 → 5235.70] but it is not
[5235.70 → 5236.26] happening.
[5236.46 → 5237.14] The pixel count
[5237.14 → 5238.54] confirms a native
[5238.54 → 5239.60] resolution of 1600
[5239.60 → 5240.66] by 900
[5240.66 → 5241.90] which is not like
[5241.90 → 5243.22] oh it has a white
[5243.22 → 5243.74] background.
[5243.90 → 5244.30] Dang it.
[5245.00 → 5245.68] Way to go
[5245.68 → 5246.30] Burke.
[5247.00 → 5247.72] Okay well anyway
[5247.72 → 5248.32] that's what our
[5248.32 → 5248.80] lower third
[5248.80 → 5249.26] we should probably
[5249.26 → 5249.66] take that
[5249.66 → 5250.54] Caterpillar logo
[5250.54 → 5250.78] out of there.
[5250.78 → 5251.10] I was just going to
[5251.10 → 5251.64] say brought to you
[5251.64 → 5252.42] by Caterpillar?
[5252.96 → 5253.48] Because digging.
[5254.08 → 5254.38] I know.
[5254.60 → 5255.16] Yeah but we should
[5255.16 → 5255.92] pull that out
[5255.92 → 5256.46] but that's going to
[5256.46 → 5257.10] be our keep on
[5257.10 → 5257.86] digging lower third
[5257.86 → 5258.26] and we're going to
[5258.26 → 5258.68] have a shirt
[5258.68 → 5259.28] coming soon.
[5259.80 → 5260.08] I was going to
[5260.08 → 5260.54] say because it's
[5260.54 → 5261.44] not actually brought
[5261.44 → 5261.64] to you by Caterpillar.
[5261.64 → 5262.26] Yeah no it's not.
[5262.34 → 5262.86] Caterpillar had
[5262.86 → 5263.48] nothing to do with it.
[5263.48 → 5264.32] They might get mad
[5264.32 → 5264.70] about that.
[5264.70 → 5266.40] Yeah so leave
[5266.40 → 5267.20] Caterpillar out of
[5267.20 → 5268.34] it but anyway
[5268.34 → 5269.18] Ubisoft go ahead.
[5269.56 → 5270.26] Yeah so we can't
[5270.26 → 5270.68] really show you
[5270.68 → 5271.16] the screenshot right
[5271.16 → 5271.64] now because this
[5271.64 → 5272.12] thing isn't working
[5272.12 → 5272.92] but it doesn't look
[5272.92 → 5274.08] good and like I
[5274.08 → 5274.74] watched their stream
[5274.74 → 5275.88] and it doesn't look
[5275.88 → 5276.22] good.
[5276.36 → 5277.28] Like the new COD
[5277.28 → 5278.04] looks better than
[5278.04 → 5278.92] it and I should
[5278.92 → 5279.78] never be able to
[5279.78 → 5280.16] say that.
[5280.84 → 5282.06] Yeah that's a pretty
[5282.06 → 5282.56] harsh burn.
[5282.78 → 5284.34] Yeah no but the new
[5284.34 → 5284.98] COD is like
[5284.98 → 5285.74] New COD looks okay.
[5285.90 → 5286.10] It does.
[5286.10 → 5286.80] Facial animations
[5286.80 → 5287.44] look good.
[5288.06 → 5288.76] Especially in
[5288.76 → 5289.08] cinematic.
[5289.30 → 5290.04] The new cinematic
[5290.04 → 5290.86] in COD if you can
[5290.86 → 5291.70] actually get the
[5291.70 → 5293.06] voice track to line up
[5293.06 → 5293.72] with the video.
[5294.22 → 5294.72] Damn it.
[5295.08 → 5296.60] Is actually pretty
[5296.60 → 5297.24] impressive and the
[5297.24 → 5298.38] in-game textures on
[5298.38 → 5299.02] like water bottles
[5299.02 → 5299.74] when you log up to
[5299.74 → 5300.42] them and stuff it's
[5300.42 → 5302.24] like wow that's not
[5302.24 → 5303.58] horrible because you
[5303.58 → 5304.38] expect from Call of
[5304.38 → 5304.88] Duty that it's going
[5304.88 → 5305.76] to be terrible.
[5306.66 → 5307.98] And from the stream
[5307.98 → 5309.36] so far and from some
[5309.36 → 5310.00] of the images that
[5310.00 → 5311.12] we've seen about
[5311.12 → 5313.08] Assassin's Creed it
[5313.08 → 5314.64] looks kind of bad.
[5315.38 → 5316.80] Like it, I don't know
[5316.80 → 5317.74] we're going to have
[5317.74 → 5319.04] to wait and see until
[5319.04 → 5320.24] we have the PC version.
[5320.24 → 5320.26] We'll have to check the
[5320.26 → 5320.86] PC version.
[5321.12 → 5322.26] Mind you what I will
[5322.26 → 5323.96] say is that seeing
[5323.96 → 5325.06] it at the Nvidia
[5325.06 → 5326.70] GTX 980 event that
[5326.70 → 5327.36] was where I first
[5327.36 → 5328.18] saw Assassin's Creed
[5328.18 → 5330.22] Unity footage was
[5330.22 → 5330.94] not blown away.
[5331.12 → 5331.32] No.
[5332.12 → 5333.52] So I don't know.
[5334.48 → 5335.86] Kind of not super
[5335.86 → 5337.02] sure about that.
[5339.26 → 5339.78] Yeah.
[5340.24 → 5341.20] Kind of not stoked.
[5341.32 → 5341.92] It doesn't look
[5341.92 → 5342.30] great.
[5342.72 → 5344.48] And like something
[5344.48 → 5345.32] that was brought up
[5345.32 → 5346.82] last week which was
[5346.82 → 5347.84] where one of the
[5347.84 → 5348.92] developers at Ubisoft
[5348.92 → 5349.90] was saying like oh
[5349.90 → 5350.94] yeah people play these
[5350.94 → 5351.80] games that are like
[5351.80 → 5353.32] pixel platformers and
[5353.32 → 5354.22] they're okay with it
[5354.22 → 5354.74] but then they want
[5354.74 → 5355.68] 1080p all the time and
[5355.68 → 5355.96] stuff.
[5356.36 → 5356.90] And it's like yeah it's
[5356.90 → 5357.64] an art style.
[5357.80 → 5358.52] This is why Nintendo
[5358.52 → 5359.34] gets away with it.
[5359.44 → 5360.98] They pick a cartoon art
[5360.98 → 5361.26] style.
[5361.26 → 5361.56] This is why Blizzard
[5361.56 → 5362.46] gets away with it.
[5362.48 → 5362.96] Yeah exactly.
[5363.08 → 5363.70] This is why Team
[5363.70 → 5364.84] Fortress 2 gets away
[5364.84 → 5365.24] with it.
[5365.40 → 5366.76] It looks perfect
[5366.76 → 5368.02] because it's a style
[5368.02 → 5369.16] that is not super hard
[5369.16 → 5369.56] to run.
[5369.76 → 5371.32] You picked a very
[5371.32 → 5372.36] realistic art style.
[5372.44 → 5373.30] That was your choice
[5373.30 → 5374.66] and it has looked good
[5374.66 → 5376.14] in the past but it
[5376.14 → 5376.92] doesn't look good right
[5376.92 → 5378.08] now and that's on you.
[5378.08 → 5378.56] Yeah.
[5378.88 → 5379.60] That sucks.
[5379.82 → 5380.44] And it's about
[5380.44 → 5381.46] expectation management.
[5381.64 → 5382.58] If you're like yeah
[5382.58 → 5383.66] we're like the next
[5383.66 → 5385.24] genes gen that ever
[5385.24 → 5386.86] had 30% more gen than
[5386.86 → 5387.74] the gen before and
[5387.74 → 5389.22] we've got like 10
[5389.22 → 5390.08] billion different
[5390.08 → 5390.90] technologies from
[5390.90 → 5391.86] Nvidia and all that
[5391.86 → 5392.12] kind of stuff.
[5392.12 → 5392.72] Then that's what we
[5392.72 → 5393.62] expect to see whereas
[5393.62 → 5395.00] if I'm playing retro
[5395.00 → 5396.02] games, and I'm like
[5396.02 → 5397.98] playing X-Wing and
[5397.98 → 5398.88] I'm gonna I have to
[5398.88 → 5399.76] fix my joystick tonight
[5399.76 → 5400.28] now that I've been
[5400.28 → 5400.92] talking about it.
[5401.00 → 5402.04] Anyway if I'm playing
[5402.04 → 5402.96] retro games well that's
[5402.96 → 5403.76] my expectation.
[5403.94 → 5404.76] I'm not expecting it to
[5404.76 → 5405.26] look amazing.
[5405.50 → 5405.62] Yeah.
[5405.62 → 5407.14] Speaking of things
[5407.14 → 5408.52] that look amazing I
[5408.52 → 5409.78] found your smartwatch.
[5410.04 → 5410.82] Oh yes.
[5410.98 → 5411.82] This has to be it.
[5411.96 → 5413.68] So add screen region
[5413.68 → 5413.94] here.
[5414.14 → 5415.18] Yeah baby.
[5415.92 → 5416.40] That.
[5416.56 → 5416.94] There we go.
[5417.20 → 5417.44] Right there.
[5417.50 → 5418.16] Well that's the back
[5418.16 → 5418.40] of it.
[5418.44 → 5419.28] This was a suggestion
[5419.28 → 5421.18] from one of the folks
[5421.18 → 5421.56] on.
[5422.98 → 5423.80] There we go.
[5423.96 → 5424.90] Oh yeah.
[5425.30 → 5425.44] Yeah.
[5425.68 → 5427.46] Oh that's beautiful.
[5427.62 → 5428.22] Pink Snoopy.
[5428.52 → 5429.58] Pink Snoopy for
[5429.58 → 5431.68] for three dollars and
[5431.68 → 5433.44] 81 cents United States.
[5433.46 → 5434.48] It's 7% off.
[5434.48 → 5435.76] 7% off.
[5435.76 → 5436.48] Free shipping to
[5436.48 → 5437.10] Canada, and it's
[5437.10 → 5437.64] three dollars and
[5437.64 → 5438.00] 80 cents.
[5438.10 → 5438.72] That's ridiculous.
[5438.90 → 5439.48] I know right.
[5439.64 → 5440.54] Isn't that amazing?
[5440.62 → 5440.90] Deal Extreme.
[5441.40 → 5442.68] Deal Extreme is amazing.
[5442.80 → 5443.46] It's the best place to
[5443.46 → 5444.36] get like obscure
[5444.36 → 5445.00] batteries.
[5445.88 → 5446.10] Yeah.
[5446.38 → 5447.10] Yeah that's cool.
[5447.52 → 5448.54] And then one that I
[5448.54 → 5449.48] didn't actually think was
[5449.48 → 5450.50] that big of a deal but
[5450.50 → 5450.96] I just thought it was
[5450.96 → 5451.24] funny.
[5451.80 → 5453.30] Is that Ubisoft is
[5453.30 → 5455.00] partnered with let me
[5455.00 → 5456.76] see here who it is
[5456.76 → 5457.24] because it's not
[5457.24 → 5458.02] actually in the title.
[5458.18 → 5459.78] I think it's Gillette.
[5460.78 → 5461.52] It says Edge.
[5461.76 → 5461.94] Yeah.
[5461.94 → 5462.60] Is that a company or
[5462.60 → 5463.34] is that Edge?
[5463.34 → 5464.98] Edge is the company?
[5465.42 → 5466.28] Yeah I think so.
[5466.52 → 5466.84] Is it?
[5467.22 → 5467.90] I don't even know.
[5467.96 → 5468.68] Or it's like a model or
[5468.68 → 5468.80] something.
[5468.86 → 5469.58] We're kind of dollar
[5469.58 → 5470.26] shave club guys.
[5471.72 → 5472.76] Some other shaving
[5472.76 → 5473.22] product.
[5474.06 → 5475.38] I think they're called
[5475.38 → 5476.00] Edge.
[5476.32 → 5476.90] I don't know.
[5477.26 → 5478.20] It's shaving cream.
[5478.76 → 5479.20] Anyway.
[5479.68 → 5481.06] You get a sword, some
[5481.06 → 5482.72] armour and an assassin's
[5482.72 → 5483.00] hood.
[5483.30 → 5483.56] Yeah.
[5483.90 → 5484.18] So.
[5484.48 → 5485.22] Okay hold on.
[5485.52 → 5486.12] I will let you talk
[5486.12 → 5486.54] about this.
[5487.02 → 5487.18] Okay.
[5488.12 → 5488.76] Hold on.
[5488.76 → 5489.14] From it.
[5490.14 → 5491.88] Does the style of the
[5491.88 → 5492.78] hood make it an
[5492.78 → 5494.44] assassin's hood or does
[5494.44 → 5495.86] the person wearing it
[5495.86 → 5496.92] make it an assassin's
[5496.92 → 5497.10] hood?
[5497.60 → 5498.42] So you could have like
[5498.42 → 5499.76] a bonnet, and it could
[5499.76 → 5500.58] be an assassin's hood?
[5500.72 → 5502.08] If it's being worn by
[5502.08 → 5503.40] an assassin.
[5503.58 → 5503.82] Right.
[5504.20 → 5504.92] I think so yeah.
[5505.18 → 5505.52] Whoa.
[5505.64 → 5506.48] It should be a bonnet.
[5512.62 → 5513.02] Anyway.
[5514.02 → 5514.94] I don't think it's that
[5514.94 → 5515.42] big of a deal.
[5515.60 → 5516.86] It's just kind of funny.
[5517.08 → 5518.08] This has happened in the
[5518.08 → 5520.08] past so if we didn't bring
[5520.08 → 5520.84] it up for other companies
[5520.84 → 5522.00] we can't really like hammer
[5522.00 → 5522.74] on them too hard.
[5523.12 → 5524.38] But like if there's no
[5524.38 → 5525.14] other way to get these
[5525.14 → 5525.94] items that's kind of
[5525.94 → 5526.26] poppy.
[5526.56 → 5527.46] It is nice that they're
[5527.46 → 5528.58] probably just cosmetic.
[5529.04 → 5529.88] So it probably doesn't
[5529.88 → 5530.40] change anything.
[5530.60 → 5531.38] So I don't really care
[5531.38 → 5532.22] about that too much.
[5532.74 → 5534.02] And some people have
[5534.02 → 5535.40] been like oh my god
[5535.40 → 5536.04] why would they partner
[5536.04 → 5536.90] with shaving cream that
[5536.90 → 5537.72] has nothing to do with
[5537.72 → 5537.98] gaming.
[5538.18 → 5538.74] And I'm like yeah well
[5538.74 → 5540.28] your audience is whatever
[5540.28 → 5541.46] insanely high percentage
[5541.46 → 5541.82] male.
[5541.82 → 5543.46] So shaving cream
[5543.46 → 5544.34] makes sense.
[5544.44 → 5545.06] Are you generalizing
[5545.06 → 5545.52] about gamers?
[5546.60 → 5547.80] Yeah actually statistics.
[5549.76 → 5551.12] Get wrecked.
[5552.86 → 5554.86] So anyway on that note
[5554.86 → 5556.06] I forget what I was
[5556.06 → 5556.74] going to talk about but
[5556.74 → 5557.34] I think that's pretty
[5557.34 → 5558.14] much it for the show
[5558.14 → 5558.42] today.
[5558.60 → 5561.74] I enjoyed the show.
[5561.84 → 5562.40] I hope you guys
[5562.40 → 5563.06] enjoyed it too.
[5563.40 → 5564.84] And part of the
[5564.84 → 5566.04] generalizing about males
[5566.04 → 5567.26] thing is that they
[5567.26 → 5568.16] Yes please go on.
[5568.22 → 5568.96] They don't have any main
[5568.96 → 5570.22] characters that are female
[5570.22 → 5571.40] female and that's
[5571.40 → 5572.46] actually maybe that's
[5572.46 → 5573.46] been brought up as a
[5573.46 → 5573.82] problem.
[5574.82 → 5576.28] So maybe it's Ubisoft's
[5576.28 → 5576.44] fault.
[5576.82 → 5577.54] What they could have
[5577.54 → 5578.90] done is if they had at
[5578.90 → 5580.04] the least one out of the
[5580.04 → 5581.34] four main characters as
[5581.34 → 5582.60] a female they could have
[5582.60 → 5583.82] had liked you get
[5583.82 → 5585.30] different items for the
[5585.30 → 5586.18] different assassins
[5586.18 → 5586.66] because there's the
[5586.66 → 5587.54] four assassins right?
[5587.88 → 5588.58] So they could have had
[5588.58 → 5589.56] four different shaving
[5589.56 → 5590.58] cream bottles and you
[5590.58 → 5591.04] get like.
[5591.10 → 5592.76] And like Yoko Ono?
[5592.76 → 5597.08] Not Yoko because bad
[5597.08 → 5598.10] singing talent is not
[5598.10 → 5598.68] something that is
[5598.68 → 5599.34] required as an
[5599.34 → 5599.62] assassin.
[5599.76 → 5600.32] No but she could be
[5600.32 → 5601.20] like bad at fighting.
[5602.16 → 5602.84] She could have like the
[5602.84 → 5603.94] four musketeers and
[5603.94 → 5604.44] like Yoko.
[5605.58 → 5607.22] That that would be what
[5607.22 → 5608.46] the female gamers want
[5608.46 → 5608.78] to see.
[5609.16 → 5609.98] That would be gender
[5609.98 → 5610.52] equality.
[5610.70 → 5611.30] I really don't.
[5611.36 → 5611.98] Yeah I really think
[5611.98 → 5612.78] that would go over very
[5612.78 → 5613.08] poorly.
[5613.48 → 5613.88] No.
[5614.44 → 5615.26] Okay that's not how it
[5615.26 → 5615.58] should go.
[5615.60 → 5616.02] That would make
[5616.02 → 5617.86] everything worse because
[5617.86 → 5619.24] it's terrible.
[5619.24 → 5622.68] like not because like
[5622.68 → 5623.46] it was had well
[5623.46 → 5624.42] intentions it's just it
[5624.42 → 5624.96] would make everything
[5624.96 → 5626.76] worse because it's dumb
[5626.76 → 5627.86] and bad.
[5628.76 → 5629.52] That would be all the
[5629.52 → 5629.78] digging.
[5630.20 → 5631.42] Yeah that would be a
[5631.42 → 5632.14] terrible idea.
[5632.44 → 5633.46] But yeah I think it
[5633.46 → 5634.14] would make sense to say
[5634.14 → 5634.84] if they had two male
[5634.84 → 5635.74] assassins two female
[5635.74 → 5636.58] assassins if they had
[5636.58 → 5638.32] two like Edge whatever
[5638.32 → 5639.64] male version and maybe
[5639.64 → 5641.16] if Edge has a female
[5641.16 → 5642.92] product I don't know I
[5642.92 → 5643.66] don't know what Edge is.
[5643.66 → 5644.46] Everyone's just talking
[5644.46 → 5645.58] about Yoko Ono in the
[5645.58 → 5646.08] chat now.
[5646.24 → 5647.14] I still don't understand
[5647.14 → 5648.28] how John didn't tell
[5648.28 → 5648.74] Ono.
[5649.24 → 5649.84] Not to shave.
[5649.96 → 5650.60] They're feminists.
[5650.88 → 5651.70] Oh no sorry that was
[5651.70 → 5652.44] two different comments.
[5653.18 → 5654.32] Didn't tell Ono to
[5654.32 → 5655.12] stop her yelling.
[5655.94 → 5656.96] Sorry sometimes the
[5656.96 → 5657.92] chat moves as you're
[5657.92 → 5659.06] reading and it, sorry.
[5660.28 → 5661.34] I think we're done here
[5661.34 → 5662.06] guys thank you for
[5662.06 → 5663.06] watching, and we'll see
[5663.06 → 5663.74] you again next week.
