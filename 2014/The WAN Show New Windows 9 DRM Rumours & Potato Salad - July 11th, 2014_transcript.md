[0.00 --> 6.12]  And welcome to the WAN Show everyone! The show where we talk about stuff that's
[6.12 --> 10.86]  going on in tech as well as whatever tickles our fancy. And let me tell you,
[10.86 --> 17.32]  when it comes to tickling, things can get pretty fancy around here.
[17.54 --> 22.12]  We've got some great topics for you this week. Windows 9 is rumored to be
[22.12 --> 28.96]  getting a revamped DRM scheme that A is kind of brutal and B kind of makes a lot
[28.96 --> 34.00]  more sense. But more on that later. Also Windows 7 is going to be losing support
[34.00 --> 39.28]  a lot sooner than I think most people would like. The, you know, just...
[39.28 --> 40.28]  They have split support though.
[40.28 --> 45.64]  The just shy of 50% of people out there that are running Windows 7 right now.
[45.64 --> 49.36]  Might not be thrilled about this. And then what else we got?
[49.36 --> 52.78]  Adblock Plus is getting sued and not for necessarily what you'd think.
[52.78 --> 58.20]  Don't you dare tell them something else. A real topic. He was gonna say potato salad.
[58.20 --> 63.24]  That is a real topic. It's not funny. It's stupid and it exploits the system.
[63.24 --> 65.88]  I don't wanna talk about how it's funny. I wanna talk about what you just said.
[65.88 --> 68.52]  It doesn't exploit the system. It exploits...
[68.52 --> 70.76]  Humanity? I don't know what it exploits.
[70.76 --> 72.76]  Humans desire to be a part of something larger?
[74.12 --> 78.96]  Is that exploitation or is that just giving them what they need to be happy?
[79.96 --> 81.92]  Is giving people what they need exploitation?
[82.86 --> 83.52]  Why don't we just...
[83.52 --> 85.66]  You're getting something from them at the same time.
[85.66 --> 86.70]  Cue the intro.
[86.70 --> 88.22]  We didn't even do another topic.
[88.22 --> 89.26]  He said as if they had a producer.
[89.26 --> 92.30]  I didn't even say potato salad. I had to do nothing for that.
[92.30 --> 94.30]  You introed the whole potato salad topic.
[94.94 --> 98.14]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[98.14 --> 104.62]  Wild dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub sbur hydrated plant,
[104.62 --> 106.46]  Do here you see one other of these.
[106.46 --> 115.18]  Good dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub Seth colif pi
[115.18 --> 117.14]  I forgot to take it at lunch today.
[118.52 --> 120.80]  Oh, look, we're just sitting in front of a blank wall
[120.80 --> 122.68]  because I'm trying to put my headphones in.
[123.00 --> 123.80]  That's pretty cool.
[124.10 --> 126.02]  Here, throw one of our sponsors up there.
[126.48 --> 129.56]  So the show today is brought to you by dollarshaveclub.com.

[143.30 --> 144.38]  They ship stuff once a month.
[144.38 --> 145.22]  Lynda.com.
[145.30 --> 146.66]  Wow, you can use it whenever.
[146.86 --> 147.84]  It's the way to learn.
[148.02 --> 151.40]  And you can look as educated and clever as her.
[152.60 --> 153.30]  Yay, internet.
[153.82 --> 155.46]  Maybe, hopefully, a little bit cleverer.
[155.56 --> 156.90]  She does look educated, though.
[157.00 --> 158.02]  She's got glasses.
[158.14 --> 159.20]  Don't chop the cable, please.
[159.28 --> 160.02]  Push it down with your foot.
[160.28 --> 162.58]  Oh, it will be fine.
[163.74 --> 165.40]  He's very protective of his cables.
[165.48 --> 167.42]  All right, we've got a great show for you today, guys.
[168.18 --> 171.38]  You know, it's kind of like we're in the driver's seat
[171.38 --> 172.78]  of what's going on here.
[172.78 --> 174.92]  We've got a great chauffeur, them.
[175.24 --> 175.58]  Chauffeur.
[175.66 --> 176.14]  Oh!
[179.40 --> 180.20]  Not good.
[180.50 --> 182.28]  No one should put us in the driver's seat.
[182.68 --> 182.94]  No.
[184.58 --> 187.74]  Especially if that driver is driving to a comedy club.
[188.06 --> 189.06]  To a comedy club.
[189.26 --> 190.86]  Because we would do really bad on stage.
[191.68 --> 192.86]  That's not even a pun.
[192.86 --> 196.28]  But get it.
[196.32 --> 197.58]  See, that's the point of the joke.
[198.18 --> 198.58]  No.
[198.76 --> 199.22]  Yes, it is.
[199.22 --> 201.84]  The point of a joke can never be that the joke isn't funny.
[202.02 --> 203.30]  But that was the whole...
[203.30 --> 204.24]  That's the whole thing.
[205.08 --> 206.88]  That we weren't funny, so we couldn't go to the comedy club.
[206.90 --> 208.20]  My jokes are funny.
[208.58 --> 209.22]  I just...
[209.22 --> 212.00]  I just laugh about pretending that they're not.
[213.62 --> 214.22]  Because...
[214.22 --> 214.84]  Um...
[214.84 --> 216.02]  I don't think your jokes are that funny.
[216.24 --> 217.22]  Some of them are funny.
[217.66 --> 218.12]  Thank you.
[218.12 --> 219.50]  I'm not sure...
[219.50 --> 222.20]  I think inherently puns can't actually be that funny.
[222.38 --> 224.74]  Oh, puns are a very high form of humor.
[225.14 --> 226.32]  This is why you're not funny.
[228.26 --> 229.86]  So anyway, um...
[229.86 --> 230.90]  Why don't you pick the first topic today?
[230.90 --> 231.88]  I like puns.
[231.98 --> 235.34]  I'm firing up the old Twitch chat here so that I can, like...
[235.34 --> 236.80]  I already fired the Twitch chat.
[236.86 --> 237.86]  The Twitch chat's on my side.
[237.86 --> 239.38]  You can't fire the Twitch chat.
[239.48 --> 240.92]  I love the Twitch chat.
[241.22 --> 241.42]  Oh.
[241.56 --> 243.04]  I defended you guys.
[243.40 --> 244.16]  Now tell me...
[244.16 --> 245.36]  Straw poll now.
[245.84 --> 246.28]  Who...
[246.28 --> 247.56]  Whose side are you on?
[247.56 --> 248.34]  Twitch chat.
[248.56 --> 249.90]  Linus is putting words in my mouth.
[250.26 --> 251.88]  Oh, it's not the only thing I'm going to put in your mouth.
[252.08 --> 252.52]  Wow!
[255.52 --> 257.22]  Speaking about putting things in people's mouths,
[257.34 --> 259.74]  Windows 9 revamped activation DRM.
[260.18 --> 262.26]  They're getting rid of CD keys.
[262.36 --> 264.86]  Those, like, giant 16-character alphanumerical things
[264.86 --> 267.08]  that you used to have to use back in the old days
[267.08 --> 268.56]  before, like, Steam and stuff.
[268.58 --> 269.64]  I hate those things.
[270.38 --> 271.20]  They're stupid.
[272.74 --> 274.06]  Have you noticed how many...
[274.06 --> 275.84]  How few times you actually have to use them now?
[275.84 --> 278.02]  I had to enter one to install Star Citizen.
[278.10 --> 278.82]  I had to enter two,
[278.90 --> 280.06]  because I had to install the game
[280.06 --> 281.52]  and then the expansion.
[281.52 --> 282.14]  What did you do for Star Citizen?
[282.48 --> 284.06]  Uh, uh, uh, Supreme Commander.
[284.20 --> 284.34]  Sorry.
[284.46 --> 284.88]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[284.88 --> 285.44]  Supreme Commander.
[285.68 --> 287.58]  So I had to enter two, like, in a row.
[287.70 --> 288.36]  I'm just like, what?
[288.84 --> 289.86]  I don't want to do this.
[290.00 --> 291.42]  I feel like the 90s.
[291.94 --> 295.06]  I have these discs and these strings of numbers.
[295.06 --> 295.88]  What?
[295.88 --> 296.90]  What is this?
[297.34 --> 297.94]  Anyway, sorry.
[298.02 --> 298.40]  Carry on.
[298.48 --> 300.56]  Tell them about the rumored DRM scheme.
[300.58 --> 301.40]  The rumored DRM scheme.
[301.46 --> 302.34]  So we're not even sure.
[302.52 --> 303.78]  But basically, what's going to happen
[303.78 --> 305.74]  is you're going to have to have a Microsoft Store account
[305.74 --> 307.94]  that's not the same as your Microsoft account.
[307.96 --> 310.70]  So I can't continue to actually just use my Hotmail account
[310.70 --> 312.08]  that I've had since the dawn of time.
[312.18 --> 312.66]  Thanks for that.
[312.76 --> 313.28]  Anyway, carry on.
[313.38 --> 314.46]  It's a Microsoft Store account.
[314.70 --> 316.80]  Um, and the images are going to be served to you
[316.80 --> 318.10]  through the Microsoft Store.
[318.24 --> 319.92]  So it's going to be attached to your account.
[320.18 --> 322.48]  Very similar to how all these, like, gaming platforms
[322.48 --> 323.34]  are doing their stuff now.
[323.34 --> 325.30]  Um, your machine's detailed.
[325.50 --> 326.88]  Usually just your motherboard details
[326.88 --> 327.98]  are going to be logged with Microsoft
[327.98 --> 331.26]  and the software is still activated on your machine.
[331.68 --> 334.56]  But if you're freaked out right now,
[334.64 --> 336.14]  just like I did when I first read that,
[336.22 --> 337.48]  it's not actually that big of a deal
[337.48 --> 339.88]  because if you go to install the OS on another machine,
[340.80 --> 342.38]  it'll just deactivate your old machine,
[342.60 --> 344.38]  re-log your new motherboard details,
[344.68 --> 345.50]  and you're good to go.
[345.88 --> 348.70]  So it's not actually, they thought about that,
[348.76 --> 350.86]  which is surprising and cool.
[351.70 --> 352.10]  Um,
[353.34 --> 355.72]  that's, that's honestly basically it.
[355.78 --> 356.88]  One of the big things they're going to be pushing
[356.88 --> 358.42]  for Windows 9, which we already knew,
[358.56 --> 360.28]  is that they're going to be trying to make it
[360.28 --> 362.20]  for people that really liked Windows 7.
[362.40 --> 363.50]  This is going to be their big push.
[363.60 --> 364.74]  They're bringing back the start menu.
[365.12 --> 366.92]  It's supposed to be an extremely functional start menu.
[367.42 --> 368.92]  Uh, they're going to be talking about it in fall
[368.92 --> 371.72]  with early public and semi-public pre-retail versions
[371.72 --> 373.76]  of the OS being released and circulated
[373.76 --> 374.56]  at that point in time.
[374.76 --> 377.04]  So, especially if you're, like, going to school
[377.04 --> 378.58]  for something in the way of, like,
[379.16 --> 381.60]  something that's related to computer science at all,
[381.60 --> 383.98]  you'll probably be getting versions of this really early.
[384.26 --> 385.58]  Or if you're in the industry at all,
[385.60 --> 386.96]  you'll probably be getting versions of this early.
[387.08 --> 389.88]  And then, um, yeah.
[390.04 --> 390.56]  I don't know.
[391.20 --> 393.50]  Windows is, like, one of the most pirated things.
[394.06 --> 397.96]  And I guess, like, I, I, I, I get that they need
[397.96 --> 399.52]  to not be pirated as much.
[399.52 --> 401.12]  And I can understand that.
[401.18 --> 401.92]  They have to do something.
[402.38 --> 405.22]  And as far as, uh, DRM approaches go,
[405.88 --> 408.96]  I mean, as long as, I don't know.
[409.04 --> 413.92]  Like, I, I used to really hate the subscription model.
[414.38 --> 417.96]  But now that I'm on it for Adobe Creative Cloud,
[418.34 --> 420.06]  um, now that I'm on it for Office,
[420.38 --> 422.10]  why is this mic so quiet?
[422.82 --> 424.10]  Having some trouble here.
[424.30 --> 424.80]  Sorry, guys.
[424.80 --> 427.64]  Um, now that I'm on it for Office as well,
[428.02 --> 430.14]  um, I'm starting to kind of like it.
[430.20 --> 432.20]  And the thing that I don't like now
[432.20 --> 435.66]  is being stuck with a single license
[435.66 --> 437.18]  of a piece of software
[437.18 --> 438.90]  that's completely non-transferable.
[439.44 --> 442.70]  Now I find that actually a lot more offensive.
[442.70 --> 443.38]  I see that happen.
[443.66 --> 444.88]  Oh, you mean, like, Steam.
[444.92 --> 445.78]  I mean, like, the,
[445.88 --> 447.62]  I mean the more traditional Windows approach.
[448.18 --> 450.28]  Where, particularly the OEM licenses,
[450.60 --> 452.08]  it's just, it's like, just...
[452.08 --> 452.60]  It's stuck.
[452.60 --> 455.70]  You had to buy it once and then it's just...
[455.70 --> 457.44]  But this kind of solves that problem.
[457.66 --> 457.88]  Yes.
[458.00 --> 459.50]  Because if you activate it on another machine,
[459.58 --> 461.56]  it just deactivates the other machine automatically.
[461.62 --> 461.80]  Yes.
[461.80 --> 462.40]  Because it saves your,
[462.46 --> 463.20]  which is actually kind of interesting.
[463.20 --> 464.72]  Now with retail copies of Windows,
[464.72 --> 466.46]  that was always the case.
[466.64 --> 468.26]  But those were also very expensive.
[468.70 --> 471.40]  But then I like what they've done with Office,
[471.60 --> 474.44]  having things like three packs for families, for example.
[474.84 --> 475.94]  Because my whole issue...
[475.94 --> 476.56]  Yeah, but they've, they've talked,
[476.72 --> 478.18]  apparently the concept can be adapted
[478.18 --> 479.84]  for three to five user family packages.
[479.90 --> 481.64]  So that makes more sense to me.
[481.64 --> 483.46]  Like, the big problem for me with Windows
[483.46 --> 487.08]  is that it's very difficult for me to swallow
[487.08 --> 489.74]  the, you know, 500 to 600
[489.74 --> 493.18]  to however many hundred dollars upgrade
[493.18 --> 494.56]  every however long.
[495.00 --> 496.44]  Like, I mean, they're releasing a new OS
[496.44 --> 497.68]  every couple of years now.
[498.00 --> 500.28]  So for me to absorb that every couple of years
[500.28 --> 503.12]  to keep my entire house up to date is absurd.
[503.32 --> 503.98]  To be completely honest,
[504.02 --> 505.32]  you can probably skip every second one
[505.32 --> 505.94]  because they're terrible.
[506.04 --> 506.66]  Well, okay.
[506.76 --> 508.28]  So let's say even every four years.
[508.28 --> 510.06]  You can ignore eight, you can ignore ten.
[510.88 --> 511.98]  Don't worry about it.
[512.34 --> 513.18]  It's fine.
[514.72 --> 515.20]  So...
[515.20 --> 515.86]  But yeah, I hear you.
[516.36 --> 518.04]  So that's, that's, I guess,
[518.16 --> 519.82]  that's, I guess, what makes me both...
[520.50 --> 522.50]  I do things a little bit differently, though.
[522.58 --> 524.48]  I usually allot an amount of money
[524.48 --> 526.48]  that I can spend on semi-frivolous things.
[526.72 --> 526.96]  Right.
[527.04 --> 527.82]  Every, like, month.
[527.82 --> 530.16]  You consider Windows to be a frivolous thing?
[530.24 --> 530.82]  Well, because I already have...
[530.82 --> 532.38]  You must have a really exciting life.
[532.52 --> 533.00]  Oh, yeah.
[533.38 --> 534.42]  But I already have...
[534.42 --> 536.40]  It's like, I'm kicking back this weekend.
[536.80 --> 538.78]  I'm gonna go buy some Windows licenses.
[539.16 --> 539.76]  You know what, though?
[539.76 --> 541.76]  If I did, I would probably spend that weekend
[541.76 --> 543.00]  just kind of tinkering with it.
[543.00 --> 544.48]  I'm picking up a six-pack.
[545.32 --> 549.24]  Go to my house.
[549.30 --> 550.36]  We can have an install party.
[551.10 --> 552.52]  Anyone who's been to an install party.
[552.68 --> 553.04]  Oh, yeah.
[553.50 --> 555.24]  Probably not that many people in the audience.
[555.36 --> 557.04]  But those were a thing at one point in time.
[557.04 --> 561.68]  Oh, NCIX did a Windows 8 launch party, remember?
[562.30 --> 563.40]  We covered that thing.
[563.42 --> 563.98]  Yeah, we did.
[564.00 --> 564.86]  Yeah, that was weird.
[564.88 --> 566.50]  But no, like, straight-up install parties.
[566.62 --> 568.60]  They used to be really popular for Linux early in the day
[568.60 --> 570.14]  when it was really hard to figure out things.
[570.26 --> 572.36]  You'd have, like, developers and stuff come down
[572.36 --> 574.28]  and everyone would help each other install
[574.28 --> 575.06]  on all their machines
[575.06 --> 576.14]  and, like, create custom drivers
[576.14 --> 577.54]  if they're having issues and stuff like that.
[577.62 --> 578.12]  Install parties.
[578.32 --> 578.82]  They used to be a thing.
[578.94 --> 579.68]  Install parties, man.
[580.14 --> 580.44]  All right.
[580.52 --> 582.14]  Anyway, what were we even talking about?
[582.24 --> 583.12]  So, I guess...
[583.12 --> 583.86]  Okay, what's your thought?
[584.12 --> 584.58]  Yay or nay?
[584.86 --> 587.02]  Okay, let's put up a hypothetical.
[587.04 --> 589.00]  It's a hypothetical the way that it's implemented.
[589.46 --> 590.76]  And then I'll let you go yay or nay.
[590.84 --> 591.70]  And if there's no issues
[591.70 --> 592.96]  and this is how it's implemented,
[593.02 --> 594.20]  then I actually kind of like it.
[594.20 --> 596.78]  So, basically, it's your online account.
[596.86 --> 598.92]  I mean, I'd love for them to just do it through Steam.
[599.70 --> 599.96]  Yeah.
[600.06 --> 600.94]  If there's a way to do that.
[601.22 --> 601.80]  They won't.
[601.90 --> 603.90]  Let's say it basically works exactly like Steam.
[604.00 --> 605.08]  So, you log into your account,
[605.24 --> 606.40]  you download your ISO,
[606.40 --> 609.38]  and then you assign the license according to whatever,
[609.48 --> 611.00]  the serial number of your motherboard or whatever else.
[611.36 --> 614.80]  And then, basically, the way it works is you buy a license
[614.80 --> 618.32]  and then you can upgrade your license to, like, a three-pack
[618.32 --> 620.38]  or a five-pack or something like that.
[620.42 --> 623.18]  And you can manage all of your machines within this one account.
[623.18 --> 625.68]  If they do it really well, it's really streamlined
[625.68 --> 627.86]  and there's no bullshit with me switching between machines
[627.86 --> 629.86]  because my motherboard and whatever the frick
[629.86 --> 631.28]  that I was scared about at the beginning,
[631.42 --> 633.46]  which apparently in this they've dealt with that.
[633.46 --> 635.34]  If there's none of that, then I'm cool with it.
[635.46 --> 635.72]  Okay.
[636.16 --> 638.28]  Because, honestly, Windows is pirated way too much.
[638.86 --> 642.52]  And if it is very streamlined and very easy for me,
[643.24 --> 644.02]  I'm okay with it.
[644.32 --> 644.64]  Okay.
[645.06 --> 646.70]  But it has to not be...
[646.70 --> 648.58]  Because the biggest problem right now is
[648.58 --> 651.16]  I honestly know people that pirate Windows
[651.16 --> 655.60]  only because it's extremely hard to maintain your Windows copy
[655.60 --> 657.26]  if you do a lot of PC upgrades.
[657.46 --> 659.18]  I mean, that's the reason that...
[659.18 --> 661.82]  I mean, a lot of people ask why on our test bench machines
[661.82 --> 664.86]  it always says this copy is not genuine in the bottom corner.
[665.20 --> 666.46]  It's not because they're pirated.
[666.58 --> 668.34]  In fact, if they were pirated, they wouldn't say that.
[668.46 --> 668.56]  Yeah.
[669.18 --> 672.42]  The reason that most of the test bench machines say that
[672.42 --> 674.68]  is because as soon as you swap hardware,
[675.20 --> 676.46]  that message starts popping up.
[676.46 --> 678.76]  Unless it's like my GPU test bench
[678.76 --> 680.72]  because it won't freak out when you change GPUs
[680.72 --> 682.78]  and that test bench has been the same for a really long time.
[683.14 --> 684.50]  So, like, certain test benches won't say that.
[684.56 --> 685.84]  But if you see that sometimes, that's why.
[685.92 --> 688.34]  And sometimes it's like they'll look for...
[688.34 --> 690.04]  Okay, you can swap the GPU as many times as you want.
[690.04 --> 692.72]  But as soon as you change the RAM and the GPU,
[693.54 --> 694.58]  now it's going to freak out.
[694.72 --> 695.16]  Or something.
[695.48 --> 698.24]  I don't think anyone quite knows exactly how the system works.
[698.30 --> 700.10]  But the point is that when it's a bench
[700.10 --> 701.88]  that we're swapping things in and out of all the time,
[702.06 --> 704.42]  they inevitably do that.
[704.60 --> 706.62]  And it doesn't affect any of the benchmark results anyway.
[706.86 --> 707.62]  So what are we going to do?
[707.74 --> 709.08]  Call them up every time?
[709.34 --> 709.54]  No.
[709.92 --> 710.48]  That's ridiculous.
[710.74 --> 711.10]  Sometimes.
[711.28 --> 712.08]  But just, like, yeah.
[712.66 --> 713.00]  No.
[713.00 --> 714.96]  So if it actually worked really streamlined,
[715.10 --> 716.46]  like if every time I changed something,
[716.68 --> 718.02]  it would just be like,
[718.14 --> 720.24]  oh, you have too many machines activated.
[720.48 --> 722.06]  And I could just be like, deactivate this one.
[722.12 --> 723.36]  And it was like, okay, perfect.
[723.60 --> 723.88]  Done.
[724.10 --> 725.18]  That would be sweet.
[725.36 --> 727.22]  So as much as this is somewhat good news,
[727.30 --> 731.86]  I still have to wonder if paid OS has a place in the modern world
[731.86 --> 734.80]  with Apple giving it away, Google giving it away.
[734.86 --> 737.98]  Well, if it becomes extremely difficult to actually pirate Windows,
[738.40 --> 739.60]  that could help Linux a lot.
[739.60 --> 740.64]  Yeah.
[742.72 --> 743.26]  All right.
[743.30 --> 745.12]  So we have the results from the straw poll.
[745.62 --> 748.84]  Oh, at least we would if my capture was working.
[749.42 --> 751.58]  That's going to be inconvenient today.
[752.00 --> 754.70]  I can't believe I didn't check this before we started streaming.
[755.20 --> 756.84]  That is extremely unfortunate.
[757.06 --> 757.40]  Get it?
[759.32 --> 760.36]  Extremely unfortunate.
[760.94 --> 762.94]  I'm just going to go check and make sure the cables actually did.
[762.94 --> 764.42]  Actually, no, we don't get that at all.
[764.88 --> 767.82]  Because every once in a while it comes out and then that's bad.
[767.82 --> 771.26]  Why is extremely unfortunate funny?
[772.08 --> 773.34]  When I don't have, wait, what?
[773.90 --> 775.14]  Stream, because we're streaming.
[775.44 --> 775.68]  Oh.
[776.28 --> 776.84]  See, it's funny.
[776.90 --> 777.22]  It's a pun.
[778.26 --> 779.62]  You wouldn't understand, apparently.
[780.56 --> 781.06]  All right.
[781.32 --> 785.40]  So I wanted to show them the results of that.
[786.28 --> 788.44]  But you know what?
[788.62 --> 790.10]  I'm going to let you do the next topic.
[790.30 --> 792.32]  And I'm just going to go get the live game reportable.
[792.62 --> 794.96]  Because it actually works, unlike these Black Magic cards.
[794.96 --> 797.44]  Do you want to hear about something that's probably going to suck?
[799.36 --> 799.84]  Really?
[799.94 --> 800.52]  You think so?
[800.76 --> 801.04]  Yeah.
[801.74 --> 803.08]  Oh, come on.
[803.14 --> 803.34]  Okay.
[803.42 --> 808.00]  So this was originally posted on the forum by Bloodwithice.
[808.48 --> 810.02]  And Kinect for Windows.
[810.16 --> 811.40]  I see it.
[811.44 --> 812.12]  I see it.
[812.34 --> 813.02]  I know.
[813.40 --> 816.18]  Kinect for Windows V2 is finally coming.
[816.18 --> 819.22]  Now, I remember how laughable it was.
[819.92 --> 824.20]  Back when they were showing off Kinect for PC.
[824.48 --> 828.42]  And they were showing off some of the medical applications, for example.
[828.68 --> 831.44]  Were you there at the Microsoft booth at Computex last year?
[831.50 --> 833.32]  I saw some stuff about it.
[833.34 --> 833.98]  I wasn't there, though.
[834.12 --> 834.30]  Okay.
[834.30 --> 835.50]  It was super cool.
[835.72 --> 842.78]  So you could just make a 3D model of something just by putting it on a rotating platform in front of a Kinect.
[842.82 --> 847.74]  But obviously the resolution is just not good enough because it's a Kinect V1 and it's stupid.
[848.12 --> 854.82]  So the amount of disappointment that I had when Xbox One launched and Microsoft was like,
[854.82 --> 856.56]  no Kinect on PC.
[856.98 --> 858.12]  Don't worry about it.
[859.42 --> 859.86]  Yay.
[860.04 --> 867.02]  Because to me, that was the only good thing that could possibly come out of Kinect V2 was putting it on the PC and letting developers...
[867.02 --> 868.56]  It should have just been a USB cable and it should have just worked.
[868.66 --> 869.36]  Yes, it should have.
[869.36 --> 873.18]  There is no reason why Kinect shouldn't just connect with a USB cable.
[873.34 --> 873.84]  Not at all.
[873.98 --> 875.56]  There's a lot of things like that, actually.
[876.84 --> 877.26]  But okay.
[877.40 --> 877.78]  Anyway.
[878.00 --> 879.60]  It's going to be $200, most likely.
[880.02 --> 880.80]  Full 1080p.
[881.18 --> 882.78]  Released July 15th.
[882.78 --> 888.24]  The problem that I see with it is that it's not shipping with its Windows SDK 2.
[888.82 --> 891.02]  And they have no price for that right now.
[891.10 --> 895.24]  So if it's not coming with that bundled in, you're not going to see massive adoption for it.
[895.24 --> 898.80]  And I don't see a lot of really big games building in support for Kinect.
[901.28 --> 901.72]  Sorry.
[902.60 --> 903.20]  I don't know.
[904.36 --> 905.38]  I don't really...
[905.38 --> 907.54]  It doesn't make a ton of sense, in my opinion.
[907.70 --> 909.50]  I can see some people doing it.
[909.54 --> 911.48]  The $200 isn't too bad.
[911.48 --> 919.26]  But something to think about is that the Leap Motion, which has way more support right now and is cheaper, also exists.
[919.86 --> 922.62]  And not all that many people are kind of jumping all over the Leap Motion.
[923.28 --> 928.48]  And the Kinect 1, when it worked on PC, didn't exactly get a huge amount of adoption.
[929.00 --> 935.00]  Most of the stuff you're seeing with Kinect 1 was hacker-type people making their own little applications that they didn't even necessarily share.
[935.00 --> 937.40]  And then that was almost it.
[938.48 --> 939.28]  So I don't know.
[939.34 --> 942.50]  I don't know if the adoption for this is going to be super huge.
[942.58 --> 948.36]  We see tons of stuff coming out right now, which is going to take a lot of custom work to work into people's games and stuff.
[948.94 --> 952.02]  And I don't see people being able to cater to all of them.
[952.16 --> 955.60]  There's that Tobii thing that SteelSeries is working on for eye tracking.
[955.60 --> 956.84]  There's Oculus.
[957.18 --> 958.46]  There's Control VR.
[958.88 --> 959.66]  There's Kinect.
[959.78 --> 960.62]  There's Leap Motion.
[960.88 --> 963.08]  There's so many different things.
[963.70 --> 964.90]  And it's way too saturated.
[965.24 --> 970.30]  And as a game developer, sitting down, are you actually going to pick Kinect as one of the things that you're going to really work on?
[970.36 --> 976.30]  I guess for me, the thing is that I don't even really see it as necessarily a gaming play.
[976.30 --> 982.48]  I think it's interesting and much more interesting in things outside of gaming, to be honest.
[982.98 --> 986.42]  I see it much more interesting in terms of what you're talking about, 3D scanning.
[986.68 --> 988.24]  3D printers are a huge deal.
[988.46 --> 992.18]  3D scanning and 3D printing with something higher res than Kinect 1.
[992.52 --> 993.90]  I think that could be really cool.
[994.00 --> 994.38]  Freaking cool.
[994.38 --> 996.62]  I don't see this being a huge thing in terms of gaming.
[996.80 --> 998.24]  That's why I always remember that a little bit.
[998.24 --> 1012.70]  Things like, even if the software development kit is somewhat expensive, with $200 hardware, if all of a sudden you can do really great motion capture, for example, that's awesome.
[1013.00 --> 1013.78]  That's really cool.
[1013.78 --> 1019.64]  So that's the kind of thing that, again, I don't expect this to make a huge difference to the average Joe immediately.
[1020.06 --> 1022.80]  But I'm glad they're finally doing it.
[1022.84 --> 1024.10]  I wish they would have done it right away.
[1024.40 --> 1025.76]  And that's sort of what I have to say about that.
[1025.90 --> 1027.00]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[1027.02 --> 1027.50]  Whose side are you on?
[1027.50 --> 1029.70]  Potato Salad is the big winner.
[1029.84 --> 1031.08]  Didn't we agree with each other on this?
[1031.54 --> 1031.96]  On what?
[1032.22 --> 1032.58]  On this?
[1033.66 --> 1039.08]  No, I didn't agree that they should be on your side and Potato Salad above me.
[1039.26 --> 1040.44]  Why would I agree on that?
[1040.94 --> 1042.60]  No, weren't we on the same side?
[1042.88 --> 1043.40]  About what?
[1043.78 --> 1044.74]  Wasn't this the Microsoft...
[1044.74 --> 1048.30]  No, I just asked them whose side they were on in general.
[1048.46 --> 1049.76]  No, it was nothing to do with Microsoft.
[1050.00 --> 1050.62]  It was just in general.
[1050.78 --> 1051.92]  So basically...
[1051.92 --> 1052.20]  Correct.
[1052.20 --> 1054.86]  In the popularity contest of Me vs. You...
[1054.86 --> 1055.20]  Correct.
[1055.20 --> 1058.10]  Potato Salad is more popular than either of us.
[1058.10 --> 1061.38]  But I wanted to bring up the Potato Salad topic, so that just gets added to my score.
[1062.16 --> 1062.52]  Correct?
[1062.92 --> 1064.50]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[1064.98 --> 1065.48]  That is how it works.
[1065.48 --> 1066.74]  Do you even know anything about math?
[1066.74 --> 1071.80]  All right, so Adblock Plus.
[1071.80 --> 1076.84]  Oh, Adblock is being sued by some Germans for something.
[1077.22 --> 1078.56]  The point is they're being sued.
[1078.66 --> 1083.30]  The original poster on the forum was Victorious Secret, and the original source is over at
[1083.30 --> 1084.60]  neowind.net.
[1084.68 --> 1086.06]  So we're going to go ahead and...
[1086.06 --> 1087.10]  There's the original article.
[1087.28 --> 1089.38]  So we all know what Adblock does.
[1089.60 --> 1093.98]  Adblock lets you block those pesky ads.
[1093.98 --> 1095.38]  Oh my god, it's in the name!
[1095.58 --> 1099.92]  Heaven forbid a content creator actually get paid for doing the work that they do.
[1099.92 --> 1103.14]  I was talking to people today about how 5 Gallon Buckets makes more money than Linus
[1103.14 --> 1103.48]  Tectives.
[1103.72 --> 1104.10]  Yeah.
[1104.32 --> 1105.30]  That kind of blew their brain.
[1105.78 --> 1106.74]  5GallonBuckets.com.
[1106.82 --> 1108.06]  More profitable than Linus Tectives.
[1109.92 --> 1110.32]  Crap.
[1110.32 --> 1115.94]  Anyway, the point is that that's how content creators get paid, and blocking ads is basically
[1115.94 --> 1117.48]  a scummy thing to do in the first place.
[1117.48 --> 1123.84]  So, should it surprise us that this company that exists for the sole... that sole product
[1123.84 --> 1133.00]  is all about avoiding other... having people avoid having someone else get paid, turns out
[1133.00 --> 1136.22]  that they're just potentially, allegedly, kind of scummy.
[1136.22 --> 1141.82]  So, the word on the street right now, and the reason that they're being sued, is not necessarily
[1141.82 --> 1146.16]  just because some company is butthurt that they're not getting paid because Adblock is
[1146.16 --> 1147.96]  allowing users to circumvent their ads.
[1147.96 --> 1148.96]  No.
[1148.96 --> 1154.78]  What they're actually being accused of is that... is having an illegal business model.
[1154.78 --> 1160.58]  So, it was recently reported that Google has been paying money in order to allow its ads
[1160.58 --> 1163.10]  to pass through Adblock Plus.
[1164.10 --> 1168.66]  So, that is... that is some dirty... dirty stuff going on.
[1168.66 --> 1168.68]  It is so dirty.
[1169.02 --> 1171.10]  That is... that is... that is super gross.
[1171.18 --> 1173.70]  People are like, yeah, Adblock isn't illegal as far as I know.
[1173.74 --> 1174.40]  You know, it's not.
[1174.60 --> 1174.76]  Nope.
[1174.76 --> 1175.00]  It's not.
[1175.10 --> 1182.60]  But what... but what is, like, some scary mafia bullshit tactics is protection money, man.
[1182.70 --> 1183.96]  Letting... letting Google pay through.
[1183.96 --> 1186.34]  And that is basically what we're talking about.
[1186.34 --> 1192.98]  That... we're talking Adblock turning their business model, if this is true, into basically
[1192.98 --> 1194.86]  a way of double dipping.
[1195.48 --> 1200.88]  Charging ad creators double in order to get people to actually see the ads.
[1201.40 --> 1202.86]  I mean, wow.
[1203.36 --> 1206.22]  It's kind of awesome, but awesome in a terrible way.
[1207.24 --> 1208.68]  Like, horrible.
[1209.00 --> 1213.76]  And I can't wait till this becomes... if... if the German guys don't win.
[1213.96 --> 1217.72]  If this becomes a much bigger thing, you can just go to Adblock's site and be like, yeah,
[1217.76 --> 1219.90]  I want you to unblock this whole website.
[1220.36 --> 1223.06]  Like, if we could, like, pay to get line-stack tips unblocked.
[1223.14 --> 1224.20]  That would be hilarious.
[1224.20 --> 1229.08]  Because that would become really widespread and then Adblock would be useless and then
[1229.08 --> 1230.20]  people would just stop using it anyways.
[1230.22 --> 1230.66]  You know what?
[1230.76 --> 1235.52]  It's... a lot of the time it's the, you know, internet liberation, whatever, blah, blah,
[1235.58 --> 1236.94]  blah, the internet should be free.
[1236.94 --> 1238.14]  Everything should be free.
[1238.14 --> 1241.46]  That are trumpeting the merits of Adblock.
[1241.82 --> 1246.86]  And then you look at what Adblock's doing, and this is no less dirty than trying to circumvent
[1246.86 --> 1248.06]  something like net neutrality.
[1248.66 --> 1250.36]  It is equally dirty.
[1250.70 --> 1254.16]  Creating tiered delivery systems on the internet is wrong.
[1254.60 --> 1254.94]  Period.
[1255.54 --> 1256.20]  So, guys...
[1256.20 --> 1259.38]  Because then you're going to have to be able to afford to make money on the internet.
[1259.66 --> 1265.60]  You're going to have to be able to afford to pay the content creator to advertise, and
[1265.60 --> 1269.96]  you're going to have to afford to pay the Adblock mafia to allow your ad through.
[1270.84 --> 1272.64]  Someone just said in the Twitch chat, Adblock is great.
[1272.70 --> 1274.16]  I'd never internet again without it.
[1274.24 --> 1275.20]  I seriously doubt it.
[1275.20 --> 1275.78]  Yeah, I doubt it.
[1275.84 --> 1281.08]  And as an Adblock user, you should hold them accountable for this in some way.
[1281.38 --> 1285.20]  So if you guys are going to go and be crusaders about whatever it is you'd be crusaders about,
[1285.46 --> 1286.28]  this is one of them.
[1286.30 --> 1288.94]  You've got to also attack Adblock for what they're doing.
[1289.24 --> 1289.94]  I'm not even saying...
[1289.94 --> 1291.04]  I'm not even saying right now...
[1291.04 --> 1293.06]  Do I personally want people to use Adblock?
[1293.28 --> 1293.52]  No.
[1293.66 --> 1294.58]  I'm a content creator.
[1295.58 --> 1298.32]  My survival is ads.
[1298.66 --> 1300.38]  So I like people to watch ads.
[1300.50 --> 1300.86]  It's good.
[1300.98 --> 1303.64]  I appreciate when they watch and listen to our sponsors and all that.
[1303.64 --> 1305.54]  But am I telling you guys right now,
[1305.92 --> 1308.02]  go and uninstall your Adblock because they're bad people?
[1308.14 --> 1308.28]  No.
[1308.38 --> 1309.32]  I'm saying do something.
[1309.68 --> 1313.40]  Because this is a bad people thing to do.
[1313.82 --> 1316.14]  At least let them know that that's not okay.
[1316.22 --> 1316.98]  And you're not going to...
[1316.98 --> 1319.88]  If you attack Adblock for this, they're not going to shut down.
[1320.24 --> 1323.56]  And it's one thing if Adblock is completely blocking ads,
[1323.74 --> 1325.40]  and it's another thing if they're not.
[1326.08 --> 1327.50]  These are both legal.
[1328.10 --> 1332.44]  But the accusation right now is that allowing the ones that
[1332.44 --> 1335.62]  they get paid to allow is not legal because
[1335.62 --> 1338.64]  that's not what the end user signed up for.
[1338.84 --> 1341.92]  That's certainly not what the ad server or the content creator had in mind.
[1342.14 --> 1346.00]  They're basically just playing around with it in their own little sandbox over there.
[1346.60 --> 1348.84]  Speaking of sandboxes, potato salad.
[1349.22 --> 1349.70]  Kickstarter.
[1350.94 --> 1352.32]  We're flying through topics.
[1352.32 --> 1357.16]  It really is just the ultimate playground right now, isn't it?
[1357.26 --> 1361.00]  One thing I got to drop first is that we're at about $47,000 now.
[1361.10 --> 1362.70]  We were at $70,000 before.
[1362.82 --> 1363.96]  So a lot of people have pulled back.
[1364.02 --> 1365.74]  I shouldn't say we because it wasn't us.
[1365.88 --> 1366.70]  This was not our idea.
[1366.92 --> 1367.24]  Neither of us.
[1368.02 --> 1368.30]  Nope.
[1368.50 --> 1371.66]  So everyone's pretty much heard about it at this point.
[1371.84 --> 1373.62]  It's some guy posted on Kickstarter.
[1373.72 --> 1374.78]  He's making potato salad.
[1374.78 --> 1380.30]  The perks are just stuff like getting better mayonnaise from the natural food section,
[1380.62 --> 1385.84]  calling a chef to get a better recipe, stuff like that.
[1386.18 --> 1386.78]  And it's...
[1387.86 --> 1390.06]  I don't even know what else I had to say about it.
[1390.06 --> 1390.80]  It's super stupid.
[1391.00 --> 1393.90]  There's a whole bunch of different stretch goals, too, like he was just talking about.
[1394.18 --> 1399.00]  Like at $3,000, which he's massively passed, and he's not putting any more stretch goals.
[1399.30 --> 1400.98]  Who's being exploited here?
[1401.16 --> 1403.02]  Because I feel like someone must be.
[1403.02 --> 1405.68]  I don't know.
[1406.12 --> 1411.02]  I mean, if people voluntarily give their money because they think it's funny...
[1412.04 --> 1413.02]  I mean...
[1413.02 --> 1418.48]  My favorite thing, too, is like the hat and the t-shirt, which they're like,
[1418.52 --> 1422.10]  yeah, you get a hat or a t-shirt, but there's no graphics of it, so you have no idea what it's going to be.
[1422.80 --> 1425.28]  Yeah, it just says potato salad-themed hat.
[1425.74 --> 1428.70]  Helvetica letters that say potato salad.
[1428.96 --> 1429.62]  Yeah, yeah.
[1429.62 --> 1430.92]  I mean, you know what?
[1430.96 --> 1434.22]  If I was a backer of this, that would probably be what I would want.
[1434.42 --> 1439.16]  It would be whatever goofy thing that the internet thinks is funny, and that would be it.
[1439.24 --> 1439.62]  I mean, I guess...
[1439.62 --> 1443.34]  So potato salad with like a cat wrapped around in a bowl and rainbows?
[1443.94 --> 1445.98]  You know, I don't know.
[1446.14 --> 1447.28]  And an EA logo on the back.
[1447.28 --> 1449.84]  I want to make a comparison to gambling here.
[1450.72 --> 1451.96]  Because gambling...
[1451.96 --> 1456.54]  But when you talk to gamblers, like there's the addicts, and then there's the people who gamble for fun.
[1456.76 --> 1459.44]  And they'll tell you, look, it's not about winning.
[1459.86 --> 1464.84]  It's about, I paid $200, and I had $200 worth of entertainment.
[1464.84 --> 1468.10]  And if they win, then great.
[1468.34 --> 1471.00]  And if they lose, then they paid for entertainment, and that's what it is.
[1471.30 --> 1472.56]  So is this...
[1472.56 --> 1480.74]  Is it wrong, and is it stupid if people are genuinely $10 worth of entertainmented by giving $10 to this,
[1481.40 --> 1483.34]  and did they get their money's worth then?
[1483.68 --> 1485.74]  Some of the stuff I really like is...
[1485.74 --> 1488.02]  And I'm going to tie into what you just said in a moment.
[1488.02 --> 1493.80]  But some of the stuff I really just like is the $3 tier, where you get a bite of potato salad.
[1494.36 --> 1496.64]  He sold that to a thousand people.
[1497.98 --> 1499.34]  He's got to make a lot of potato salad.
[1500.40 --> 1501.90]  Yeah, a thousand bites of potato salad.
[1501.92 --> 1503.78]  But I guess that does kind of tie in.
[1503.92 --> 1510.74]  So if you donated $3, is it worth it so that one day you'll get potato salad in the mail,
[1511.52 --> 1515.12]  and you can Instagram it or tweet it to your friends or post it on Facebook or whatever,
[1515.12 --> 1519.68]  and be like, LOL, look, I just got potato salad in the mail because of this Kickstarter thing that I backed.
[1519.80 --> 1521.16]  Is that worth the $3? Maybe.
[1521.36 --> 1527.28]  I mean, it's funny because we have such different standards for different entertainment media
[1527.28 --> 1529.82]  in terms of how much we're willing to pay.
[1530.34 --> 1533.42]  Like, for some reason, we're okay paying, you know...
[1533.42 --> 1538.20]  I mean, by the time you take a lady friend with you, buy a popcorn, buy a drink...
[1538.20 --> 1538.78]  Like $60?
[1539.28 --> 1541.78]  It's $20... Well, I was going to say like $25, $30.
[1542.08 --> 1544.04]  I don't know what kind of popcorn you're buying, but...
[1544.04 --> 1546.50]  Dude, two popcorns and two drinks is like $25.
[1546.78 --> 1547.82]  What, you bought her popcorn?
[1549.82 --> 1551.30]  And you didn't bring your own drink?
[1551.90 --> 1552.92]  I thought you were going to say...
[1552.92 --> 1553.12]  What are you, stupid?
[1553.30 --> 1554.82]  I thought you were going to say, and you didn't bring me.
[1555.60 --> 1556.26]  Yeah, really?
[1557.70 --> 1558.90]  You bought her popcorn?
[1559.50 --> 1562.18]  You didn't buy popcorn for me?
[1563.68 --> 1565.30]  Maybe that was where I was going to the next.
[1565.30 --> 1570.56]  Actually, me, I always make sure that we eat before we go because I'm never buying that stupid crap.
[1570.86 --> 1571.82]  It's way too expensive.
[1571.82 --> 1573.58]  Okay, well, let's say you only buy tickets.
[1573.72 --> 1576.60]  Let's say you're a complete cheapskate like the two men in this room.
[1577.76 --> 1582.34]  And you still paid like $25 to go and be entertained for an hour and a half.
[1582.34 --> 1590.44]  And then you get people upset over a playtime of six hours for a AAA game that they paid $60 for.
[1590.94 --> 1592.18]  It's like, well, hold on a second.
[1592.42 --> 1592.90]  And I'm not saying you're...
[1592.90 --> 1595.62]  Even some people are upset when it's like 10, 15 hours.
[1595.76 --> 1596.96]  And I'm not saying you're wrong.
[1596.96 --> 1601.52]  I was pretty upset about episode five of Wolf Among Us.
[1602.10 --> 1605.04]  I was like, yeah, that was an hour of playtime.
[1605.30 --> 1606.58]  And like a third of it...
[1606.58 --> 1607.16]  Spoiler alert.
[1608.94 --> 1614.22]  And like a third of it is stupid fight scenes that aren't even as good as the ones in the previous games
[1614.22 --> 1615.58]  and this like weird chase.
[1615.80 --> 1622.32]  And then the rest of it is the most predictable dialogue crap ever.
[1622.80 --> 1624.00]  I was so disappointed.
[1624.00 --> 1626.90]  Like episodes one and two, awesome.
[1627.36 --> 1630.76]  And then it's like they got the Game of Thrones franchise and they're like, okay,
[1630.94 --> 1639.46]  we need to like pinch out this Wolf Among Us thing as fast as we can so that we can make all the money making Game of Thrones games.
[1639.52 --> 1639.96]  That's probably it too.
[1639.98 --> 1641.00]  Which is probably...
[1641.00 --> 1643.48]  I'm not accusing anyone of anything, but there you go.
[1643.78 --> 1644.44]  Anyway, so those...
[1644.44 --> 1645.70]  Another thing I want to bring up is...
[1645.70 --> 1647.02]  What are we even talking about anymore?
[1647.10 --> 1647.60]  Potato salad.
[1647.74 --> 1652.00]  But another thing I want to bring up is that the amount of tears where he has to say thank you
[1652.00 --> 1657.18]  during making the potato salad, he has to say thank you to like 4,000 something people.
[1658.14 --> 1660.40]  Like the first tier, you get it for a dollar.
[1660.56 --> 1662.70]  So 1,745 people back that.
[1662.94 --> 1665.76]  The second tier you get it, 1,058 people back that.
[1665.92 --> 1668.82]  The third tier you get it, 1,020 people back that.
[1668.96 --> 1671.08]  I think it's probably going to go through the whole thing.
[1671.14 --> 1674.14]  Do you think he's bitten off more than he can chew?
[1674.14 --> 1678.12]  Do you bite off a piece of potato salad?
[1680.56 --> 1682.44]  You'd have to make like a potato salad bar.
[1683.00 --> 1684.74]  You know what's funny?
[1685.04 --> 1686.26]  Fancy restaurants, man.
[1686.42 --> 1687.20]  I swear.
[1687.56 --> 1690.26]  The less prepared the food is, the more expensive it is.
[1690.26 --> 1691.68]  The less prepared and the more stacked.
[1692.64 --> 1693.02]  Think about it.
[1693.06 --> 1695.58]  The less fancy the restaurant is, the more flat your plate is.
[1695.68 --> 1697.90]  When you go to a fancy restaurant, they just put everything in a pile.
[1697.90 --> 1699.28]  So, here.
[1699.56 --> 1703.06]  Like these are basically just the stupidest thing ever.
[1703.18 --> 1706.56]  I went to a restaurant once and like it was someone else's treat.
[1706.74 --> 1708.90]  I never eat at places like this.
[1709.40 --> 1712.60]  And I was just like, how do I eat this?
[1713.26 --> 1714.82]  This is called a wedge salad.
[1714.82 --> 1716.42]  I was like, what the hell is this?
[1716.76 --> 1717.64]  That's so stupid.
[1718.08 --> 1720.72]  Basically, they just quarter a thing of iceberg lettuce.
[1720.84 --> 1722.30]  It's not even expensive lettuce.
[1722.74 --> 1723.58]  Iceberg lettuce.
[1724.08 --> 1726.10]  Like they're like, what, 60 cents a head.
[1726.10 --> 1729.08]  And then they put like bacon and stuff on it.
[1729.12 --> 1730.96]  And it's like, yeah, we prepared this.
[1731.06 --> 1734.02]  And the guy's like, oh, yeah, you use a fork and a knife.
[1734.34 --> 1734.92]  I'm like, what?
[1735.16 --> 1739.26]  So, I, and it was like $25 for the salad or something like that.
[1739.26 --> 1740.50]  And I'm like, so what?
[1740.56 --> 1742.80]  I pay more and they prepare it less.
[1743.24 --> 1748.00]  So, in my mind, if he made the fanciest potato salad ever,
[1748.26 --> 1750.04]  it would actually be whole potatoes.
[1752.04 --> 1754.46]  A potato that you like mashed an egg into.
[1756.10 --> 1758.18]  And it's drizzled over the top.
[1758.66 --> 1760.76]  It's like how-to basic potato salad edition.
[1761.18 --> 1762.46]  It's like put a whole bunch of potato,
[1762.62 --> 1764.42]  throw a whole bunch of potatoes into a bowl,
[1764.58 --> 1767.08]  and then take a whole thing of eggs and just throw it into the bowl.
[1767.18 --> 1768.00]  And then be like, there.
[1768.60 --> 1770.36]  Here's your freaking potato salad.
[1771.06 --> 1772.20]  Green onions are extra.
[1772.62 --> 1776.90]  How-to basic the restaurant would be a scary place to eat.
[1776.90 --> 1779.72]  But there's so many people that would go to it.
[1779.84 --> 1780.46]  I know, right?
[1782.28 --> 1783.36]  I'd almost want to go.
[1783.98 --> 1787.34]  Did I tell you about my restaurant concept that I had a little while ago?
[1787.52 --> 1787.72]  No.
[1788.12 --> 1788.40]  Okay.
[1788.50 --> 1791.22]  I had an idea that I actually think is amazing.
[1791.82 --> 1796.02]  So, kind of themed fun restaurants are a bit of a thing.
[1796.22 --> 1797.36]  Sorry, I'm going to interject real quick.
[1797.46 --> 1800.68]  He quite literally has to say thank you to all 5,808 people.
[1800.82 --> 1800.98]  Excellent.
[1800.98 --> 1802.34]  Every single tier has that included.
[1802.34 --> 1805.16]  And given how many people have names that are impossible to pronounce,
[1805.28 --> 1805.98]  that's going to be a challenge.
[1806.16 --> 1806.36]  It is.
[1806.48 --> 1808.42]  Anyway, there's one called, what is it called?
[1808.48 --> 1808.86]  Dark Table?
[1809.26 --> 1809.52]  Yes.
[1809.72 --> 1813.72]  Dark Table, where the entire restaurant is completely blacked out.
[1813.74 --> 1815.68]  The unfortunate thing about Dark Table in Vancouver
[1815.68 --> 1819.88]  is that the entry door doesn't have like a spacing at the beginning.
[1820.62 --> 1822.00]  Oh, so when people open up the door?
[1822.30 --> 1824.48]  So, when you open up the door, you get light.
[1824.56 --> 1824.74]  Right.
[1824.84 --> 1826.20]  And the bathroom is the same way.
[1826.20 --> 1828.12]  And Dark Tables in other cities,
[1828.12 --> 1832.38]  there's usually some type of like dark room in between the dining area
[1832.38 --> 1833.60]  and a dark room in between the bathroom.
[1834.00 --> 1834.20]  Okay.
[1834.30 --> 1834.60]  So, anyway.
[1834.74 --> 1837.28]  So, Dark Table, it's completely blacked out inside
[1837.28 --> 1840.66]  and it's supposed to be kind of like having the experience of being blind.
[1840.76 --> 1842.48]  All the waiters and waitresses are blind.
[1842.70 --> 1843.56]  The cooks are not.
[1844.00 --> 1844.24]  Okay.
[1844.60 --> 1846.36]  So, Dark Table is kind of cool.
[1846.64 --> 1847.34]  And I was like, okay.
[1847.42 --> 1851.32]  So, if people are into this whole like interesting dining experience thing,
[1851.32 --> 1855.58]  I was thinking of having, there should be a restaurant
[1855.58 --> 1859.54]  where all the food is incredibly awkward and difficult to eat.
[1860.96 --> 1861.76]  So, I thought...
[1861.76 --> 1862.60]  That should be hilarious.
[1862.92 --> 1866.12]  It would be the ultimate icebreaker first date
[1866.12 --> 1868.36]  or like double date place to go.
[1868.80 --> 1872.22]  So, you could have dishes like single noodle spaghetti
[1872.22 --> 1874.60]  where the entire thing is one noodle
[1874.60 --> 1876.40]  and you don't give them a spoon or a knife.
[1876.86 --> 1879.54]  So, basically, you just have to like...
[1879.54 --> 1883.08]  Like the chop it off with your teeth thing?
[1883.10 --> 1883.24]  Yeah.
[1883.34 --> 1886.04]  So, the idea is just that if everyone looks like an idiot,
[1886.32 --> 1888.30]  then no one has to worry about,
[1888.52 --> 1889.54]  oh, I spilled a little bit
[1889.54 --> 1891.42]  or I have something dripping down my elbows.
[1891.68 --> 1893.22]  Like, you could have sandwiches
[1893.22 --> 1895.74]  with just like basically, you know,
[1896.22 --> 1899.74]  disgusting amounts of sauce intentionally on one side of it.
[1899.84 --> 1900.56]  Like eat from this side.
[1900.56 --> 1901.48]  So, that it will go out.
[1901.48 --> 1902.16]  And then it will...
[1902.16 --> 1903.48]  So, it'll just drip down your elbows.
[1903.62 --> 1904.68]  Just stuff like that
[1904.68 --> 1906.24]  where you want things to still be delicious
[1906.24 --> 1909.36]  but they would be intentionally socially awkward to eat.
[1910.16 --> 1912.30]  And like the rules would be
[1912.30 --> 1913.74]  whatever utensils we bring you,
[1913.82 --> 1915.20]  that's all you can use to eat it.
[1915.32 --> 1918.58]  They only give you like no utensils at all
[1918.58 --> 1919.26]  so they don't give you any
[1919.26 --> 1921.10]  and it's sushi that's way too big to fit in your mouth.
[1921.38 --> 1921.72]  Yeah.
[1921.86 --> 1922.92]  Like stuff like that, right?
[1922.96 --> 1923.32]  Yeah, yeah.
[1923.52 --> 1924.98]  So, you'd have to like destroy it
[1924.98 --> 1926.08]  or mash it in your mouth.
[1926.24 --> 1926.60]  Yes.
[1927.14 --> 1928.28]  See, that kind of thing.
[1928.32 --> 1929.52]  I think that would be a lot of fun.
[1929.60 --> 1930.58]  That would actually probably be a lot of fun.
[1930.58 --> 1932.78]  Someone needs to have that restaurant.
[1933.30 --> 1934.84]  Maybe this potato salad guy
[1934.84 --> 1935.88]  should start that restaurant.
[1935.88 --> 1936.24]  Yeah.
[1936.24 --> 1938.32]  With his like $47,000.
[1938.82 --> 1939.82]  That's not even...
[1939.82 --> 1941.22]  Yeah, I guess that's a lot of money.
[1941.82 --> 1942.94]  Not enough to start a restaurant.
[1943.12 --> 1943.60]  That's what I meant.
[1943.64 --> 1944.90]  I meant that in the context of
[1944.90 --> 1946.18]  not enough to start a restaurant.
[1946.36 --> 1947.14]  Not like...
[1947.14 --> 1948.50]  I am so...
[1948.50 --> 1948.90]  I meant that he's so loaded
[1948.90 --> 1951.14]  that $40,000 is not a lot of money to him.
[1951.14 --> 1952.06]  It is going to be interesting though
[1952.06 --> 1953.52]  because with that $47,000
[1953.52 --> 1956.22]  he has to make a recipe book
[1956.22 --> 1957.10]  for potato salad.
[1957.52 --> 1958.46]  He has to ship out...
[1958.46 --> 1959.06]  Yeah, I saw that.
[1959.06 --> 1960.30]  ...thousands and thousands
[1960.30 --> 1961.80]  of bites of potato salad.
[1962.00 --> 1962.96]  Like a lot of them.
[1963.90 --> 1965.50]  He has to...
[1965.50 --> 1966.94]  All the t-shirts, all the hats.
[1966.94 --> 1967.66]  Make that video.
[1967.86 --> 1969.30]  All the t-shirts, all the hats.
[1969.44 --> 1970.82]  I think there might even be more stuff.
[1970.92 --> 1971.64]  There's a lot of shipping
[1971.64 --> 1972.26]  that's going to be in here.
[1972.54 --> 1973.60]  He's shipping out thousands
[1973.60 --> 1974.54]  and thousands of things
[1974.54 --> 1975.46]  so he's probably not going to be able
[1975.46 --> 1976.22]  to do it by himself.
[1976.70 --> 1977.54]  He's probably going to have to get people
[1977.54 --> 1979.42]  to help him like...
[1979.42 --> 1980.32]  He's going to come out
[1980.32 --> 1981.14]  with a ton of money.
[1981.74 --> 1982.92]  Probably not even that much.
[1982.94 --> 1984.42]  But it's not going to be $47,000.
[1985.04 --> 1986.40]  I could easily see him
[1986.40 --> 1987.66]  spending at least $20,000
[1987.66 --> 1990.50]  doing all this stuff.
[1990.90 --> 1991.30]  I don't know.
[1991.36 --> 1992.90]  I just don't see the appeal.
[1997.78 --> 1998.88]  I think it's funny
[1998.88 --> 2000.84]  but I don't think it's technically funny.
[2001.10 --> 2001.66]  I don't know.
[2001.90 --> 2002.58]  There's no such thing
[2002.58 --> 2003.52]  as technically funny.
[2003.68 --> 2004.68]  Humor is not technical.
[2005.26 --> 2006.46]  But you can have a terrible
[2006.46 --> 2007.50]  sense of humor.
[2007.54 --> 2009.64]  Okay.
[2009.78 --> 2011.62]  So speaking of not a lot of money
[2011.62 --> 2013.16]  Samsung's factory
[2013.16 --> 2014.68]  was robbed at gunpoint.
[2014.68 --> 2014.86]  Not a lot of money?
[2015.06 --> 2017.02]  $36 million
[2017.02 --> 2018.40]  in smartphones,
[2018.66 --> 2019.04]  tablets,
[2019.24 --> 2020.92]  and laptops stolen.
[2021.16 --> 2021.90]  So it was a group
[2021.90 --> 2023.46]  of about 20 armed men.
[2023.86 --> 2025.60]  This happened earlier this week.
[2026.14 --> 2028.06]  The speculation right now
[2028.06 --> 2029.54]  is that there was probably
[2029.54 --> 2031.40]  someone on the inside
[2031.40 --> 2033.32]  involved in pulling off
[2033.32 --> 2034.00]  this heist.
[2034.00 --> 2034.88]  But basically
[2034.88 --> 2036.68]  they had some of the employees
[2036.68 --> 2038.46]  subdued at gunpoint.
[2038.56 --> 2039.16]  They had others
[2039.16 --> 2040.22]  just kind of going about
[2040.22 --> 2041.14]  their days working
[2041.14 --> 2041.80]  not even aware
[2041.80 --> 2042.46]  of what was going on.
[2042.46 --> 2043.00]  That's my favorite part.
[2043.08 --> 2043.72]  While some employees
[2043.72 --> 2044.36]  were held hostage
[2044.36 --> 2044.92]  during the site,
[2045.00 --> 2045.62]  the report claims
[2045.62 --> 2046.56]  that the majority of others
[2046.56 --> 2048.18]  just continued working.
[2048.18 --> 2050.86]  It's just like,
[2050.86 --> 2051.68]  what?
[2053.80 --> 2054.30]  You're like,
[2054.34 --> 2055.18]  I can't run away
[2055.18 --> 2056.38]  because they'll shoot me.
[2057.00 --> 2058.40]  And if I stop working,
[2059.24 --> 2060.28]  who knows?
[2060.36 --> 2061.48]  My job could be in jeopardy.
[2062.08 --> 2063.08]  So I just might as well
[2063.08 --> 2063.80]  keep on working.
[2064.80 --> 2065.20]  So,
[2065.34 --> 2066.74]  yeah,
[2066.84 --> 2067.10]  I mean,
[2067.18 --> 2067.50]  I would,
[2067.72 --> 2068.62]  you know,
[2068.80 --> 2069.10]  the funny,
[2069.24 --> 2069.40]  like,
[2069.48 --> 2070.68]  I don't mean for this
[2070.68 --> 2071.88]  to come across the wrong way,
[2072.02 --> 2073.96]  but I just don't get it.
[2074.16 --> 2075.16]  What would you even do
[2075.16 --> 2076.46]  with that many smartphones?
[2076.64 --> 2077.76]  How would you even unload
[2077.76 --> 2078.58]  that many smartphones
[2078.58 --> 2079.92]  without getting caught?
[2079.98 --> 2081.02]  If you know people
[2081.02 --> 2082.22]  that own stores
[2082.22 --> 2082.78]  or whatever.
[2083.58 --> 2083.96]  Right.
[2084.12 --> 2084.34]  But,
[2084.44 --> 2084.76]  I mean,
[2084.76 --> 2085.96]  we're talking smartphones.
[2086.10 --> 2086.82]  We're talking things
[2086.82 --> 2089.08]  with digital serial numbers
[2089.08 --> 2090.62]  that are going to be reported
[2090.62 --> 2092.22]  to a carrier
[2092.22 --> 2092.94]  at some point.
[2092.94 --> 2093.14]  Like,
[2093.20 --> 2093.68]  these are things
[2093.68 --> 2094.82]  that are pretty difficult
[2094.82 --> 2096.60]  to cover up.
[2096.72 --> 2097.66]  They're very trackable.
[2097.80 --> 2097.94]  I mean,
[2098.38 --> 2099.46]  it's one of those things
[2099.46 --> 2099.62]  where,
[2099.68 --> 2099.94]  I don't know,
[2099.98 --> 2101.12]  you guys ever watch numbers?
[2102.32 --> 2102.52]  You know,
[2102.60 --> 2103.96]  you go on a map,
[2104.18 --> 2104.78]  you kind of go,
[2104.90 --> 2105.22]  okay,
[2105.48 --> 2105.68]  well,
[2105.74 --> 2106.26]  here's where they're
[2106.26 --> 2107.00]  being activated.
[2108.30 --> 2109.30]  They're probably coming
[2109.30 --> 2110.08]  from somewhere in here.
[2110.16 --> 2110.26]  Like,
[2110.30 --> 2111.72]  this is legitimately
[2111.72 --> 2112.64]  a way that you could
[2112.64 --> 2113.56]  track something like this.
[2113.86 --> 2114.14]  So,
[2114.24 --> 2115.14]  unless they have
[2115.14 --> 2116.92]  an extremely diverse
[2116.92 --> 2118.04]  distribution network
[2118.04 --> 2119.02]  all full of people
[2119.02 --> 2119.56]  who aren't going to
[2119.56 --> 2120.22]  breathe a word,
[2121.04 --> 2122.26]  how do you not get caught
[2122.26 --> 2122.84]  doing something
[2122.84 --> 2123.44]  like this?
[2123.78 --> 2124.12]  Move,
[2124.46 --> 2125.06]  I guess.
[2126.56 --> 2126.96]  Like,
[2126.98 --> 2127.40]  you might be able
[2127.40 --> 2128.24]  to find the store,
[2128.86 --> 2129.36]  but then maybe
[2129.36 --> 2130.38]  the store doesn't know.
[2131.48 --> 2132.04]  Maybe you go
[2132.04 --> 2132.62]  to a distributor.
[2132.80 --> 2133.42]  But the issue
[2133.42 --> 2135.02]  is that someone knows.
[2135.10 --> 2135.60]  Someone knows.
[2135.70 --> 2136.06]  And,
[2136.28 --> 2136.84]  I don't know
[2136.84 --> 2137.32]  what the laws
[2137.32 --> 2138.00]  are like in Brazil,
[2138.16 --> 2138.76]  but here,
[2139.28 --> 2140.60]  selling stolen goods,
[2140.72 --> 2141.12]  even if,
[2141.20 --> 2141.36]  oh,
[2141.44 --> 2142.14]  I didn't know,
[2142.24 --> 2143.04]  is still illegal.
[2143.28 --> 2144.02]  It's still a big deal.
[2144.18 --> 2144.32]  Yeah.
[2144.32 --> 2144.82]  So,
[2144.82 --> 2146.46]  I don't know.
[2146.98 --> 2147.70]  I have no idea
[2147.70 --> 2148.14]  what the laws
[2148.14 --> 2148.74]  are like in Brazil,
[2148.74 --> 2149.98]  but I can't imagine
[2149.98 --> 2150.40]  this would be
[2150.40 --> 2151.00]  the hardest thing
[2151.00 --> 2151.48]  to track.
[2151.96 --> 2152.68]  Especially if they
[2152.68 --> 2153.62]  sold that much money
[2153.62 --> 2154.12]  worth of stuff.
[2154.38 --> 2154.96]  They must have been
[2154.96 --> 2156.08]  in there for so long.
[2156.34 --> 2156.54]  Oh yeah,
[2156.58 --> 2157.02]  they were loading
[2157.02 --> 2157.66]  trucks and trucks
[2157.66 --> 2158.02]  and trucks.
[2158.02 --> 2158.04]  Yeah,
[2158.10 --> 2158.22]  yeah,
[2158.22 --> 2158.62]  exactly.
[2158.94 --> 2159.12]  So,
[2159.18 --> 2159.90]  the amount of chance
[2159.90 --> 2160.42]  that you left
[2160.42 --> 2161.40]  some type of
[2161.40 --> 2162.86]  DNA evidence behind,
[2163.54 --> 2164.16]  the amount of chance
[2164.16 --> 2165.12]  that some camera
[2165.12 --> 2166.20]  got you at some point
[2166.20 --> 2166.64]  in time.
[2166.88 --> 2167.06]  Well,
[2167.12 --> 2167.72]  the good news is
[2167.72 --> 2168.38]  they didn't kill
[2168.38 --> 2169.10]  or hurt anyone.
[2169.44 --> 2170.48]  Because if they had,
[2170.72 --> 2171.48]  then it becomes,
[2172.02 --> 2172.30]  I mean,
[2172.38 --> 2173.26]  it's still,
[2173.44 --> 2174.34]  whatever is bigger
[2174.34 --> 2175.26]  than grand theft,
[2175.40 --> 2176.20]  but all of a sudden
[2176.20 --> 2177.60]  it becomes murder.
[2177.86 --> 2178.04]  Yeah.
[2179.42 --> 2179.82]  Yeah,
[2179.98 --> 2180.38]  geez,
[2180.44 --> 2180.74]  I don't know.
[2180.74 --> 2181.44]  People are saying
[2181.44 --> 2182.18]  there's a lot of gold
[2182.18 --> 2182.80]  in smartphones.
[2183.04 --> 2184.12]  I really think
[2184.12 --> 2184.70]  that there are
[2184.70 --> 2186.08]  better ways
[2186.08 --> 2187.70]  to get that much gold
[2187.70 --> 2189.26]  with 20 armed people
[2189.26 --> 2190.42]  than breaking
[2190.42 --> 2192.44]  into a smartphone factory
[2192.44 --> 2194.42]  and taking them apart.
[2194.68 --> 2194.74]  That is probably
[2194.74 --> 2196.44]  not what they're going for.
[2196.82 --> 2197.02]  I mean,
[2197.50 --> 2198.68]  I gave,
[2198.68 --> 2199.88]  I give you guys props.
[2200.00 --> 2200.24]  Like,
[2200.36 --> 2201.42]  thank you for the good idea,
[2201.52 --> 2202.62]  but I really don't think
[2202.62 --> 2203.12]  that's it.
[2203.30 --> 2203.70]  Like,
[2203.76 --> 2204.46]  if I was going to
[2204.46 --> 2206.44]  coordinate a heist like this
[2206.44 --> 2208.24]  and I wanted gold,
[2208.62 --> 2210.60]  I would probably rob
[2210.60 --> 2212.60]  a jewelry distribution hub,
[2212.80 --> 2214.06]  not an electronics one.
[2214.12 --> 2214.90]  And those exist.
[2215.08 --> 2216.30]  Just throwing that out there.
[2217.96 --> 2218.86]  Probably hard to find.
[2218.92 --> 2219.74]  Probably harder to find
[2219.74 --> 2220.30]  than, like,
[2220.84 --> 2222.38]  Samsung's distribution hub.
[2222.38 --> 2223.10]  But if you are
[2223.10 --> 2224.10]  bringing along
[2224.10 --> 2224.92]  20 people
[2224.92 --> 2226.56]  armed with truck drivers
[2226.56 --> 2227.04]  and everything,
[2227.04 --> 2228.80]  I don't know.
[2228.98 --> 2230.10]  You could probably find it.
[2230.10 --> 2230.56]  You could probably
[2230.56 --> 2231.22]  figure it out.
[2231.30 --> 2231.48]  Yeah.
[2232.12 --> 2232.54]  All right,
[2232.60 --> 2233.68]  so speaking of smartphones,
[2234.02 --> 2234.82]  the original poster
[2234.82 --> 2235.88]  for this on the forum
[2235.88 --> 2238.40]  was Adam Isaac Lang.
[2238.74 --> 2239.62]  And the original article
[2239.62 --> 2240.94]  is from VentureBeat
[2240.94 --> 2242.28]  and it's all about
[2242.28 --> 2243.20]  Avast,
[2243.58 --> 2244.76]  recovering data
[2244.76 --> 2246.16]  off of cell phones
[2246.16 --> 2246.84]  that they bought
[2246.84 --> 2247.58]  on eBay.
[2247.94 --> 2248.84]  This is something
[2248.84 --> 2250.12]  that I guess
[2250.12 --> 2251.62]  we should have seen coming.
[2251.62 --> 2256.18]  But I had expected
[2256.18 --> 2257.22]  to be a little bit
[2257.22 --> 2257.96]  more difficult
[2257.96 --> 2258.86]  and a little bit
[2258.86 --> 2259.84]  less effective
[2259.84 --> 2261.08]  than it turns out
[2261.08 --> 2261.60]  that it was.
[2261.68 --> 2262.18]  Because the thing
[2262.18 --> 2263.70]  about flash-based storage
[2263.70 --> 2265.26]  is that unlike
[2265.26 --> 2266.88]  magnetic-based storage,
[2267.08 --> 2267.74]  it's actually
[2267.74 --> 2268.88]  reshuffling itself
[2268.88 --> 2269.60]  in the background
[2269.60 --> 2270.70]  quite a bit.
[2270.96 --> 2272.08]  So magnetic-based storage,
[2272.18 --> 2273.14]  the way that file recovery
[2273.14 --> 2273.56]  works,
[2273.88 --> 2275.10]  is when you delete something,
[2275.24 --> 2276.18]  it only deletes
[2276.18 --> 2276.84]  the references
[2276.84 --> 2278.36]  to where the files are.
[2278.44 --> 2278.90]  It doesn't actually
[2278.90 --> 2279.88]  delete the entire file
[2279.88 --> 2280.44]  because that's very
[2280.44 --> 2281.12]  time-consuming
[2281.12 --> 2281.92]  and magnetic storage
[2281.92 --> 2282.50]  is slow.
[2282.88 --> 2283.80]  With an SSD,
[2284.18 --> 2286.30]  particularly a trim-enabled one,
[2286.62 --> 2287.72]  it actually does
[2287.72 --> 2288.44]  a bit more
[2288.44 --> 2289.36]  of a thorough job.
[2289.48 --> 2289.84]  It does,
[2289.98 --> 2290.70]  it's going to have
[2290.70 --> 2291.84]  to delete the references,
[2292.04 --> 2292.48]  the pointers,
[2292.82 --> 2294.02]  to where the files are.
[2294.32 --> 2295.12]  But then,
[2295.46 --> 2296.84]  between sort of
[2296.84 --> 2297.94]  cleaning up the drive
[2297.94 --> 2298.76]  in order to optimize
[2298.76 --> 2299.82]  it for better performance
[2299.82 --> 2302.44]  and both in terms of trim
[2302.44 --> 2303.48]  and in terms of
[2303.48 --> 2304.74]  idle garbage collection,
[2305.38 --> 2306.96]  a lot of data
[2306.96 --> 2307.78]  should in theory
[2307.78 --> 2308.64]  be lost
[2308.64 --> 2309.82]  and scrambled around.
[2309.88 --> 2311.14]  Because unlike a hard drive
[2311.14 --> 2312.28]  where you're going to write
[2312.28 --> 2313.52]  a file as continuously
[2313.52 --> 2314.36]  as possible,
[2314.72 --> 2315.60]  with an SSD,
[2316.24 --> 2317.12]  things get scattered
[2317.12 --> 2318.12]  around all over the place.
[2318.20 --> 2318.98]  So even though
[2318.98 --> 2321.18]  you might only actually delete,
[2321.52 --> 2322.06]  let's say,
[2322.16 --> 2323.86]  5% of a file
[2323.86 --> 2325.22]  as you are reshuffling
[2325.22 --> 2325.92]  things around,
[2326.40 --> 2327.50]  there's still a good chance
[2327.50 --> 2328.54]  that you would corrupt,
[2328.62 --> 2330.00]  especially certain file types
[2330.00 --> 2331.36]  that aren't as resilient
[2331.36 --> 2334.28]  to partial losses
[2334.28 --> 2334.94]  of their data.
[2335.36 --> 2336.86]  So I didn't expect this
[2336.86 --> 2338.42]  to work as well as it did,
[2338.42 --> 2340.24]  but according to the report
[2340.24 --> 2341.36]  from Avast,
[2342.06 --> 2343.26]  they were able to get
[2343.26 --> 2344.34]  40,000 photos,
[2344.50 --> 2345.46]  750 emails,
[2345.64 --> 2347.16]  250 names and addresses,
[2347.74 --> 2349.80]  and one loan application.
[2350.80 --> 2351.70]  Why do you have your loan
[2351.70 --> 2352.74]  application on your phone?
[2353.86 --> 2354.90]  Don't do that.
[2354.90 --> 2357.18]  But in general,
[2357.38 --> 2357.62]  I mean,
[2357.72 --> 2359.20]  part of the whole thing there
[2359.20 --> 2359.80]  is they're like,
[2359.88 --> 2360.36]  okay, look,
[2360.42 --> 2361.26]  you should probably use
[2361.26 --> 2361.78]  our software
[2361.78 --> 2363.16]  and do a proper secure wipe
[2363.16 --> 2363.88]  where you're actually
[2363.88 --> 2365.16]  overwriting things.
[2365.16 --> 2367.04]  So it's a bit of a publicity stunt
[2367.04 --> 2368.18]  more than anything else.
[2368.84 --> 2370.16]  But the fact that...
[2370.16 --> 2372.22]  What was it?
[2372.30 --> 2374.04]  I forget what the numbers were.
[2374.14 --> 2375.08]  It's not in our notes,
[2375.22 --> 2377.88]  but only a very small fraction
[2377.88 --> 2378.52]  of the phones
[2378.52 --> 2380.00]  had any security software
[2380.00 --> 2382.00]  previously installed on them
[2382.00 --> 2382.70]  whatsoever.
[2383.14 --> 2384.20]  So Avast's point,
[2384.42 --> 2385.56]  and their app is free,
[2385.70 --> 2386.26]  so it's not like
[2386.26 --> 2387.08]  they're actually trying
[2387.08 --> 2387.80]  to sell you something
[2387.80 --> 2388.82]  for five bucks or whatever.
[2388.98 --> 2390.04]  Avast's point is,
[2390.42 --> 2391.16]  yo, guys,
[2391.86 --> 2393.14]  please be aware of this.
[2393.48 --> 2394.46]  Your phone is like
[2394.46 --> 2396.52]  the least secure thing ever.
[2397.30 --> 2397.96]  Oh, apparently it was
[2397.96 --> 2398.60]  to boost sales
[2398.60 --> 2399.54]  of its secure wipe
[2399.54 --> 2400.58]  antivirus program
[2400.58 --> 2402.28]  for $30 a year.
[2403.14 --> 2403.58]  Okay.
[2403.80 --> 2404.42]  When I was reading
[2404.42 --> 2405.32]  the article earlier,
[2405.64 --> 2406.70]  I think they have
[2406.70 --> 2408.18]  one security app
[2408.18 --> 2408.96]  that is free.
[2409.16 --> 2409.30]  Okay.
[2409.52 --> 2409.82]  So there you go.
[2409.88 --> 2410.12]  Anyway,
[2410.42 --> 2411.46]  there are free apps,
[2411.56 --> 2411.68]  though,
[2411.76 --> 2413.10]  that can do a proper
[2413.10 --> 2414.60]  secure erase of your phone,
[2414.74 --> 2415.78]  so just something
[2415.78 --> 2416.46]  to be aware of,
[2416.46 --> 2417.18]  even if you don't want
[2417.18 --> 2417.92]  to give Avast
[2417.92 --> 2419.56]  your money for it.
[2420.10 --> 2420.54]  Okay.
[2421.10 --> 2422.72]  A little bit confused there.
[2422.78 --> 2423.20]  My bad.
[2423.38 --> 2424.36]  The security prices
[2424.36 --> 2425.56]  packages range
[2425.56 --> 2426.50]  with the most costing
[2426.50 --> 2426.96]  about $30
[2426.96 --> 2428.80]  while Avast is free.
[2428.92 --> 2429.32]  Thank you.
[2429.52 --> 2430.18]  Avast is free.
[2430.24 --> 2430.66]  I knew it.
[2432.12 --> 2432.68]  All right.
[2433.26 --> 2435.12]  So here was kind of
[2435.12 --> 2436.14]  a scandal this week.
[2436.20 --> 2436.84]  This was interesting.
[2437.48 --> 2439.22]  So the FTC is
[2439.22 --> 2441.20]  suing T-Mobile
[2441.20 --> 2442.40]  or fining them
[2442.40 --> 2442.96]  or whatever it is
[2442.96 --> 2443.62]  they're doing to them.
[2443.68 --> 2443.98]  Basically,
[2443.98 --> 2444.92]  they want money from them
[2444.92 --> 2447.18]  for knowingly adding
[2447.18 --> 2448.68]  bogus charges
[2448.68 --> 2449.54]  to the bills
[2449.54 --> 2450.86]  of their customers.
[2451.56 --> 2452.30]  This was originally
[2452.30 --> 2453.18]  posted on the forum
[2453.18 --> 2454.70]  by Ryu-kun
[2454.70 --> 2456.18]  and there have actually
[2456.18 --> 2458.14]  been quite a few
[2458.14 --> 2459.24]  updates to this.
[2459.24 --> 2460.28]  His post was really good
[2460.28 --> 2460.66]  by the way.
[2460.70 --> 2461.50]  As it's gone
[2461.50 --> 2463.04]  along here.
[2463.36 --> 2464.80]  So pretty much
[2464.80 --> 2466.42]  T-Mobile fired back
[2466.42 --> 2467.78]  almost immediately
[2467.78 --> 2468.46]  saying,
[2468.92 --> 2469.20]  you know,
[2469.34 --> 2469.58]  hey,
[2469.86 --> 2470.20]  well,
[2470.40 --> 2470.66]  look,
[2470.80 --> 2472.56]  we don't engage
[2472.56 --> 2473.08]  in this.
[2473.18 --> 2474.14]  It was an industry
[2474.14 --> 2474.70]  problem.
[2475.64 --> 2476.92]  We don't understand
[2476.92 --> 2478.04]  why we're being
[2478.04 --> 2478.68]  gone after
[2478.68 --> 2479.64]  because we're
[2479.64 --> 2480.42]  about the most
[2480.42 --> 2481.56]  consumer-friendly
[2481.56 --> 2482.98]  mobile carrier
[2482.98 --> 2483.92]  ever.
[2485.40 --> 2486.16]  Their CEO
[2486.16 --> 2487.06]  called the claims
[2487.06 --> 2487.94]  unfounded
[2487.94 --> 2488.98]  and without
[2488.98 --> 2489.68]  merit
[2489.68 --> 2491.02]  and we believe
[2491.02 --> 2491.52]  that customers
[2491.52 --> 2492.30]  should pay only
[2492.30 --> 2493.14]  for what they want
[2493.14 --> 2494.14]  and what they sign up
[2494.14 --> 2494.48]  for.
[2495.44 --> 2495.60]  And,
[2495.68 --> 2496.76]  yeah,
[2497.24 --> 2498.84]  so the FTC
[2498.84 --> 2500.02]  says that the services
[2500.02 --> 2500.46]  that they were
[2500.46 --> 2501.40]  charging for in question
[2501.40 --> 2502.44]  had refund request
[2502.44 --> 2503.10]  rates of up to
[2503.10 --> 2504.82]  40% in a single
[2504.82 --> 2505.24]  month
[2505.24 --> 2506.64]  and T-Mobile
[2506.64 --> 2507.28]  is allegedly
[2507.28 --> 2508.00]  collecting as much
[2508.00 --> 2508.80]  as 40% of the
[2508.80 --> 2509.54]  revenue generated
[2509.54 --> 2510.82]  from these services.
[2510.82 --> 2510.96]  services.
[2511.54 --> 2511.82]  So,
[2512.32 --> 2512.82]  I'll be interested
[2512.82 --> 2513.36]  to see how this
[2513.36 --> 2514.18]  plays out.
[2514.42 --> 2514.94]  Services being
[2514.94 --> 2516.52]  like blurting tips
[2516.52 --> 2517.34]  and horoscope
[2517.34 --> 2518.72]  and celebrity
[2518.72 --> 2520.06]  crap and stupid
[2520.06 --> 2520.78]  things like that
[2520.78 --> 2521.38]  which no one
[2521.38 --> 2522.08]  should ever do.
[2522.08 --> 2522.28]  Yeah,
[2522.40 --> 2523.30]  so basically
[2523.30 --> 2524.54]  these are premium
[2524.54 --> 2525.84]  SMS services
[2525.84 --> 2527.04]  that they are
[2527.04 --> 2528.14]  commonly charging for.
[2528.44 --> 2529.06]  I didn't even know
[2529.06 --> 2529.74]  those still existed.
[2530.42 --> 2531.12]  I didn't know
[2531.12 --> 2531.50]  that either.
[2531.80 --> 2532.34]  In fact,
[2532.52 --> 2533.52]  I don't even know
[2533.52 --> 2534.44]  why I still get
[2534.44 --> 2535.16]  SMS messages
[2535.16 --> 2535.94]  from my carrier
[2535.94 --> 2536.60]  with the new
[2536.60 --> 2537.64]  legislation in Canada
[2537.64 --> 2539.80]  that forbids spam.
[2540.70 --> 2541.80]  Even mailing lists
[2541.80 --> 2542.94]  that I'm signed up
[2542.94 --> 2543.98]  for have told me
[2543.98 --> 2544.78]  they can't continue
[2544.78 --> 2546.00]  to email me
[2546.00 --> 2547.62]  unless I specifically
[2547.62 --> 2548.30]  authorize them
[2548.30 --> 2548.78]  to do it.
[2549.36 --> 2550.80]  Is SMS not covered
[2550.80 --> 2551.22]  by this?
[2551.30 --> 2552.00]  I actually haven't
[2552.00 --> 2552.62]  looked into it
[2552.62 --> 2552.88]  that deeply.
[2552.88 --> 2553.10]  It should be.
[2553.10 --> 2553.78]  That's more annoying
[2553.78 --> 2554.26]  than email.
[2554.44 --> 2556.08]  Because I got an
[2556.08 --> 2556.82]  upgrade to the
[2556.82 --> 2557.94]  Galaxy S4 Mini
[2557.94 --> 2559.04]  for only this much
[2559.04 --> 2560.02]  text the other day
[2560.02 --> 2560.64]  and it carries
[2560.64 --> 2561.02]  something like
[2561.02 --> 2561.64]  a $10 million
[2561.64 --> 2562.96]  fine or $1 million
[2562.96 --> 2563.76]  or $10 million
[2563.76 --> 2564.14]  or something.
[2564.24 --> 2564.56]  I constantly get stupid
[2564.56 --> 2565.44]  annoying tell us
[2565.44 --> 2566.10]  text messages.
[2566.10 --> 2567.54]  Yeah, well the issue
[2567.54 --> 2568.36]  is that I'm close
[2568.36 --> 2568.70]  to the end
[2568.70 --> 2569.34]  of my contract.
[2570.10 --> 2571.64]  My contract is ended
[2571.64 --> 2572.36]  so they just
[2572.36 --> 2573.76]  spam me constantly.
[2573.84 --> 2574.38]  It's like, wow,
[2574.62 --> 2575.52]  I'm at a time
[2575.52 --> 2578.02]  in my cycle here
[2578.02 --> 2579.12]  when I can leave you
[2579.12 --> 2579.76]  at any time.
[2580.20 --> 2581.02]  Seems like a good
[2581.02 --> 2582.10]  opportunity to piss
[2582.10 --> 2583.08]  me off, doesn't it?
[2583.16 --> 2583.36]  Yeah.
[2583.64 --> 2584.80]  What goes through
[2584.80 --> 2585.54]  carriers' heads?
[2585.62 --> 2585.96]  But you know
[2585.96 --> 2586.92]  what the scary thing is?
[2587.20 --> 2588.08]  If it didn't work
[2588.08 --> 2588.72]  they wouldn't do it.
[2588.84 --> 2589.04]  Yep.
[2589.42 --> 2590.40]  I'm sure it works.
[2591.08 --> 2592.34]  Because you're not even
[2592.34 --> 2593.30]  I know a lot of people
[2593.30 --> 2594.14]  that don't even realize
[2594.14 --> 2595.38]  their contract actually ends.
[2595.38 --> 2596.22]  they're like,
[2596.26 --> 2596.88]  oh, I can get this phone
[2596.88 --> 2597.30]  for this much?
[2597.36 --> 2597.52]  Sure.
[2597.60 --> 2598.46]  They go in and get that phone
[2598.46 --> 2599.48]  and they're contracted again.
[2601.86 --> 2602.70]  Well, there you go.
[2602.80 --> 2603.48]  If you don't even really
[2603.48 --> 2604.70]  think about when your period ends
[2604.70 --> 2605.28]  if you don't really think
[2605.28 --> 2606.18]  about all those other things.
[2606.64 --> 2608.98]  That did not come out right.
[2610.26 --> 2612.22]  I meant your contract period.
[2613.40 --> 2614.44]  Oh, no.
[2615.02 --> 2615.38]  Okay.
[2615.96 --> 2616.32]  Anyways.
[2616.32 --> 2619.56]  I guess that's a thing.
[2619.64 --> 2620.10]  I still haven't picked
[2620.10 --> 2620.74]  what I'm going to go with
[2620.74 --> 2623.54]  in terms of carriers.
[2625.54 --> 2626.68]  Can we move on now?
[2629.08 --> 2629.52]  Nanopixels.
[2629.78 --> 2630.88]  So this was originally
[2630.88 --> 2631.98]  posted on the forum
[2631.98 --> 2634.38]  by DLF
[2634.38 --> 2635.16]  and the original article
[2635.16 --> 2636.36]  is on Extreme Tech.
[2636.36 --> 2637.36]  So we're talking
[2637.36 --> 2638.10]  resolutions
[2638.10 --> 2642.50]  150 times higher.
[2644.16 --> 2644.72]  Nanopixels.
[2645.20 --> 2646.48]  So blah, blah, blah,
[2646.60 --> 2647.16]  et cetera, et cetera.
[2647.24 --> 2648.16]  Researchers have created
[2648.16 --> 2648.98]  nanopixels that measure
[2648.98 --> 2651.80]  just 300 by 300 nanometers.
[2652.02 --> 2652.68]  So comparing this
[2652.68 --> 2653.64]  to a modern smartphone
[2653.64 --> 2656.56]  with a 400 pixel per inch display,
[2656.96 --> 2658.04]  we're talking, yes,
[2658.38 --> 2660.12]  150 times more.
[2660.12 --> 2662.18]  Now, obviously,
[2662.62 --> 2663.84]  we could create
[2663.84 --> 2665.98]  extremely high resolution displays
[2665.98 --> 2667.46]  with this technology,
[2667.46 --> 2669.54]  but there are
[2669.54 --> 2670.94]  some other complications.
[2671.18 --> 2671.78]  So for example,
[2672.20 --> 2673.38]  we'd have to figure out
[2673.38 --> 2675.88]  what kind of a display interface
[2675.88 --> 2677.12]  is going to be able
[2677.12 --> 2677.84]  to handle
[2677.84 --> 2686.54]  198,000 by 120,000 pixels.
[2686.54 --> 2687.54]  Is that the resolution
[2687.54 --> 2688.18]  that it does
[2688.18 --> 2689.72]  or can you do much lower?
[2690.12 --> 2691.32]  It can just do up to that
[2691.32 --> 2692.00]  because I'm pretty sure
[2692.00 --> 2693.10]  it can just do up to that.
[2693.44 --> 2693.92]  Yeah, no,
[2694.00 --> 2695.42]  it would be up to that
[2695.42 --> 2696.10]  depending on...
[2696.10 --> 2696.38]  So you don't have
[2696.38 --> 2697.40]  to push it that hard.
[2697.52 --> 2698.44]  No, I think they're just,
[2698.54 --> 2699.18]  they're taking like
[2699.18 --> 2700.24]  probably a 5-inch
[2700.24 --> 2701.64]  phone screen size
[2701.64 --> 2702.12]  and going,
[2702.28 --> 2703.76]  well, if we can do 1920 by 1200,
[2704.28 --> 2705.46]  then we could do this.
[2705.48 --> 2706.66]  With this potential density,
[2706.80 --> 2707.26]  we can do this.
[2707.32 --> 2708.02]  Yeah, because I don't,
[2708.20 --> 2709.28]  I don't actually see anyone
[2709.28 --> 2710.40]  really actually pushing
[2710.40 --> 2711.04]  that resolution
[2711.04 --> 2712.24]  because it's ridiculous.
[2712.86 --> 2714.18]  So, so we'd have to figure out
[2714.18 --> 2715.66]  how to even drive
[2715.66 --> 2717.00]  resolutions like that
[2717.00 --> 2717.38]  with the,
[2717.48 --> 2718.30]  we'd have to catch up
[2718.30 --> 2719.44]  in terms of processing power,
[2719.52 --> 2720.10]  we'd have to catch up
[2720.10 --> 2721.26]  in terms of display interfaces.
[2721.38 --> 2722.78]  I mean, maybe light-based interfaces
[2722.78 --> 2724.06]  could take us,
[2724.16 --> 2724.36]  you know,
[2724.40 --> 2725.66]  the next step forward.
[2726.06 --> 2728.90]  But I guess my whole thing here
[2728.90 --> 2731.74]  is for most stuff,
[2732.14 --> 2733.92]  it's probably a moot point.
[2734.14 --> 2734.30]  Yep.
[2734.36 --> 2735.90]  For TVs, irrelevant.
[2736.60 --> 2739.50]  For computers, irrelevant.
[2739.94 --> 2741.10]  And even for smartphones,
[2741.54 --> 2742.54]  I would say irrelevant.
[2742.54 --> 2744.88]  I have a really hard time
[2744.88 --> 2745.92]  telling the difference
[2745.92 --> 2748.50]  between the 2560 by 1440 display
[2748.50 --> 2749.34]  on the G3
[2749.34 --> 2751.14]  versus the 1080p display
[2751.14 --> 2751.98]  on the 1M8.
[2752.10 --> 2753.50]  It's just not that different.
[2753.70 --> 2754.36]  One thing I was thinking about
[2754.36 --> 2755.48]  is sometimes it becomes
[2755.48 --> 2756.50]  actually more expensive
[2756.50 --> 2757.98]  to manufacture older technology.
[2758.50 --> 2759.16]  So if just everything
[2759.16 --> 2760.16]  starts moving towards this,
[2760.24 --> 2761.28]  maybe it becomes cheaper
[2761.28 --> 2762.58]  and they're not even aiming
[2762.58 --> 2763.36]  for that resolution.
[2763.56 --> 2764.94]  They just aim for a way lower resolution,
[2765.06 --> 2766.08]  but just use this technology.
[2766.46 --> 2766.50]  And...
[2766.50 --> 2767.56]  Maybe it comes to TVs,
[2767.68 --> 2768.36]  they don't need it,
[2768.42 --> 2769.26]  but maybe it just...
[2769.26 --> 2770.82]  I mean, if the tech gets used
[2770.82 --> 2771.60]  for other things,
[2771.68 --> 2772.68]  like if it gets used
[2772.68 --> 2774.68]  for better passive 3D,
[2775.08 --> 2776.34]  if it gets used for things
[2776.34 --> 2777.62]  like adding pixels
[2777.62 --> 2779.12]  with more colors,
[2779.38 --> 2780.26]  so that we can...
[2780.26 --> 2781.78]  Like you look at...
[2781.78 --> 2783.06]  Ah, shoot.
[2783.12 --> 2783.76]  Who is it who does
[2783.76 --> 2785.34]  the fourth yellow pixel
[2785.34 --> 2786.00]  in their TVs?
[2786.16 --> 2786.64]  Is it Sharp?
[2787.02 --> 2787.44]  I think so.
[2787.50 --> 2788.16]  I think it's Sharp.
[2788.24 --> 2791.04]  Anyway, you look at stuff like that
[2791.04 --> 2792.40]  and what that kind of tech
[2792.40 --> 2793.54]  can do to push things forward.
[2793.84 --> 2795.14]  I can see it being used there,
[2795.28 --> 2798.50]  but in larger form factor devices,
[2798.50 --> 2799.76]  I don't think it's that relevant.
[2799.90 --> 2800.98]  The place that I really see
[2800.98 --> 2801.96]  this being used, though,
[2802.34 --> 2804.72]  is head-mounted displays,
[2805.00 --> 2805.46]  wearables,
[2805.74 --> 2806.72]  and then things like
[2806.72 --> 2807.64]  micro-projectors.
[2808.02 --> 2809.66]  So we've seen some interesting stuff
[2809.66 --> 2810.84]  done with holograms.
[2811.08 --> 2811.66]  So what's that...
[2811.66 --> 2812.00]  What is it?
[2812.04 --> 2812.70]  Like Miku?
[2813.06 --> 2815.38]  Or what's that Japanese pop star character
[2815.38 --> 2816.20]  with the green hair?
[2816.20 --> 2816.60]  Yeah, yeah.
[2816.66 --> 2817.74]  I don't know the name,
[2817.82 --> 2818.48]  but I know what you're talking about.
[2818.50 --> 2818.90]  Yeah, yeah.
[2819.30 --> 2821.10]  I feel like we should probably...
[2821.10 --> 2821.98]  They've also done hologram
[2821.98 --> 2822.76]  for Tupac, though.
[2823.20 --> 2824.00]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[2824.48 --> 2826.56]  So Miku Singer...
[2826.56 --> 2828.10]  Miku Virtual Singer.
[2828.10 --> 2828.86]  Here we go.
[2829.50 --> 2830.44]  Hatsune Miku.
[2830.62 --> 2831.08]  There we go.
[2831.44 --> 2832.90]  The world's virtual diva.
[2832.98 --> 2834.18]  Anyway, the point is
[2834.18 --> 2836.58]  they've done concerts with her
[2836.58 --> 2838.28]  as a hologram,
[2838.60 --> 2839.38]  much like they did
[2839.38 --> 2840.48]  that thing with Tupac,
[2840.60 --> 2842.52]  and I would see
[2842.52 --> 2844.78]  very, very tiny displays like this
[2844.78 --> 2846.76]  as an interesting way
[2846.76 --> 2848.64]  to push that technology forward.
[2848.78 --> 2849.86]  So if you wanted something like
[2849.86 --> 2852.76]  a wrist-mounted holographic projector thing,
[2852.84 --> 2855.10]  we'd be talking extremely small...
[2855.10 --> 2856.80]  we'd be talking extremely small optics,
[2856.94 --> 2857.78]  and we'd be looking for ways
[2857.78 --> 2858.52]  to miniaturize things
[2858.52 --> 2859.66]  as much as we possibly could.
[2859.78 --> 2862.82]  So that's where I'm really excited
[2862.82 --> 2863.96]  to see this technology going.
[2864.06 --> 2865.08]  But I see a lot of the comments
[2865.08 --> 2866.24]  on this article that are like,
[2866.64 --> 2869.86]  oh, we could have a 4K smartwatch.
[2869.92 --> 2870.56]  I'm just like, yeah,
[2870.62 --> 2871.54]  we don't need that.
[2871.60 --> 2872.60]  Who gives a crap?
[2873.62 --> 2874.28]  At all.
[2874.28 --> 2878.68]  I mean, if they could,
[2878.74 --> 2880.10]  if they can make them transparent,
[2880.28 --> 2881.30]  and we could have really neat
[2881.30 --> 2882.32]  stackable displays.
[2882.50 --> 2882.74]  Yes.
[2882.86 --> 2883.88]  So that we have, like,
[2883.88 --> 2885.04]  a transparent watch
[2885.04 --> 2886.60]  that had display elements
[2886.60 --> 2887.44]  at every level,
[2887.60 --> 2889.60]  and, like, I don't know.
[2889.76 --> 2890.56]  Or have, like,
[2890.58 --> 2891.18]  the thing I was talking about
[2891.18 --> 2892.02]  with the real watch.
[2892.36 --> 2892.66]  Yes.
[2892.74 --> 2895.00]  With the digital watch screen on top,
[2895.06 --> 2895.94]  which can fade
[2895.94 --> 2897.32]  so you can see the real watch under it.
[2897.68 --> 2898.48]  So I know a lot of people
[2898.48 --> 2899.38]  that are just like,
[2899.44 --> 2900.48]  I want a mechanical watch
[2900.48 --> 2901.98]  because I like mechanical watches.
[2902.54 --> 2903.62]  I'm like, yeah, well,
[2903.70 --> 2904.20]  there's other things
[2904.20 --> 2904.74]  that could be helpful.
[2904.90 --> 2906.32]  So maybe if the screen illuminates
[2906.32 --> 2907.96]  when you get a notification,
[2908.30 --> 2909.38]  and then when there's no notifications,
[2909.56 --> 2910.06]  it fades away,
[2910.14 --> 2911.30]  and you have your nice mechanical watch.
[2911.50 --> 2912.30]  That could be pretty cool.
[2912.52 --> 2913.74]  I got my wife going on the Pebble.
[2914.26 --> 2914.56]  Did you?
[2914.74 --> 2915.00]  Yeah.
[2915.12 --> 2915.70]  How'd she like it?
[2915.96 --> 2917.22]  She really likes it.
[2917.64 --> 2918.26]  And she's,
[2918.58 --> 2919.84]  so a couple things.
[2919.94 --> 2921.42]  Number one is at her work,
[2921.50 --> 2922.66]  they can't carry their phones with them.
[2923.86 --> 2924.74]  She's in a pharmacy.
[2925.08 --> 2925.60]  It's unprofessional.
[2926.34 --> 2927.46]  So, what?
[2927.62 --> 2928.34]  It's kind of cheating.
[2928.70 --> 2928.96]  What?
[2929.20 --> 2930.62]  Having your Pebble
[2930.62 --> 2931.86]  if you can't carry your phone with you,
[2931.86 --> 2932.16]  at work?
[2932.38 --> 2933.40]  It's just a watch, man.
[2933.66 --> 2934.76]  So the point is,
[2934.82 --> 2936.94]  she can leave her phone in her bag,
[2937.38 --> 2938.72]  and she's not breaking any rules.
[2938.90 --> 2940.74]  But if something urgent comes through,
[2941.14 --> 2942.12]  like, I'm like,
[2942.32 --> 2942.82]  where's the,
[2942.90 --> 2943.86]  where's the child?
[2944.02 --> 2945.38]  I need to go retrieve him.
[2946.08 --> 2947.44]  And I don't know where to go,
[2947.68 --> 2949.02]  because these kinds of things happen.
[2949.24 --> 2950.18]  I don't have to call,
[2950.32 --> 2951.18]  I don't have to call
[2951.18 --> 2952.50]  and interrupt the entire pharmacy.
[2953.20 --> 2954.76]  I can just text,
[2955.10 --> 2958.14]  and then she can go slip off
[2958.14 --> 2958.38]  to screen.
[2958.38 --> 2960.10]  And she has a moment or whatever.
[2960.46 --> 2961.30]  And then the other time
[2961.30 --> 2962.18]  it's going to be really useful
[2962.18 --> 2964.06]  is she's going on maternity leave.
[2964.44 --> 2966.04]  Actually, starting today,
[2966.14 --> 2967.68]  she's on short-term disability
[2967.68 --> 2968.60]  because of,
[2969.02 --> 2969.74]  she's got, like,
[2969.92 --> 2971.34]  these shooting pains
[2971.34 --> 2972.42]  and she can't stand all day.
[2972.84 --> 2974.32]  So she's on short-term disability
[2974.32 --> 2975.86]  until her maternity leave starts.
[2976.24 --> 2977.12]  And a lot of the time
[2977.12 --> 2978.38]  when you're taking care of a baby,
[2978.48 --> 2979.56]  so once she's on her mat leave,
[2979.56 --> 2982.54]  you're just kind of
[2982.54 --> 2983.62]  all over the place.
[2983.74 --> 2984.20]  Dealing with the baby,
[2984.28 --> 2984.84]  you're not necessarily
[2984.84 --> 2985.82]  keeping track of your phone.
[2985.90 --> 2986.96]  So she has a watch on her.
[2987.08 --> 2988.44]  You strap something to yourself.
[2989.28 --> 2990.08]  It's way too early.
[2990.26 --> 2991.36]  Then it's easier for me
[2991.36 --> 2991.88]  to get in touch with her
[2991.88 --> 2993.26]  because I had a really hard time
[2993.26 --> 2993.96]  getting in touch with her
[2993.96 --> 2995.34]  last time she was on maternity leave.
[2995.60 --> 2996.84]  For those of you who don't know,
[2997.04 --> 2998.26]  my baby's due
[2998.26 --> 3000.04]  in about three weeks.
[3000.28 --> 3002.28]  So that's what's up
[3002.28 --> 3004.82]  as far as all that is concerned.
[3005.52 --> 3006.10]  Someone said,
[3006.18 --> 3007.06]  I'm going to break this laptop.
[3007.22 --> 3007.66]  I have no idea
[3007.66 --> 3008.36]  what they're talking about.
[3008.36 --> 3009.40]  And another person said
[3009.40 --> 3010.92]  that once the 4K watch shows up,
[3010.96 --> 3011.82]  you're going to be super excited.
[3011.98 --> 3012.72]  And I think you're wrong.
[3013.04 --> 3014.14]  You're totally wrong.
[3014.66 --> 3015.70]  How many cares did I give
[3015.70 --> 3016.42]  about the G3
[3016.42 --> 3019.12]  and its high resolution screen?
[3019.28 --> 3019.58]  Go ahead.
[3019.66 --> 3020.24]  Watch the review.
[3021.80 --> 3022.70]  That's how many cares
[3022.70 --> 3024.16]  I will give about the 4K watch.
[3024.28 --> 3025.26]  I've had a few more people
[3025.26 --> 3027.30]  watch my 792 thing.
[3027.68 --> 3027.98]  Oh yeah?
[3028.28 --> 3029.52]  Everyone likes it so far.
[3030.12 --> 3031.18]  Speaking of which,
[3031.24 --> 3031.62]  you know what?
[3031.70 --> 3033.84]  Let's go hate on Microsoft
[3033.84 --> 3034.68]  for a little bit here.
[3034.76 --> 3035.88]  So let's start with Microsoft
[3035.88 --> 3037.28]  pulling Windows 7 support
[3037.28 --> 3037.96]  in six months.
[3037.96 --> 3039.44]  This was originally posted
[3039.44 --> 3040.64]  by Dietrich W.
[3040.84 --> 3041.42]  on the forum
[3041.42 --> 3042.26]  and the article here
[3042.26 --> 3043.40]  is from Business Insider.
[3044.18 --> 3044.58]  It's not,
[3044.70 --> 3044.94]  it's,
[3045.02 --> 3045.68]  uh...
[3045.68 --> 3046.12]  Well,
[3046.72 --> 3047.12]  okay.
[3047.38 --> 3049.10]  It's not really pulling support.
[3049.28 --> 3050.04]  I still call,
[3050.04 --> 3050.28]  it's not fair.
[3050.32 --> 3051.60]  I still call bullshit on this
[3051.60 --> 3052.40]  because we're not going to get
[3052.40 --> 3053.14]  DirectX 12.
[3053.42 --> 3053.66]  No.
[3054.18 --> 3055.40]  Which is bullshit.
[3055.66 --> 3055.92]  Yes.
[3057.06 --> 3057.36]  So...
[3057.36 --> 3057.96]  I'm not disagreeing with you
[3057.96 --> 3058.56]  on that point at all.
[3058.62 --> 3058.90]  Okay.
[3058.98 --> 3059.66]  It's just not...
[3059.66 --> 3060.52]  So we're on the same page.
[3060.58 --> 3060.80]  Yes.
[3060.90 --> 3061.14]  You just,
[3061.22 --> 3062.42]  you can't properly say
[3062.42 --> 3063.36]  that they're pulling support
[3063.36 --> 3063.98]  because they're not.
[3063.98 --> 3066.54]  not supporting DirectX 12
[3066.54 --> 3067.32]  is bullshit.
[3067.80 --> 3069.02]  Especially if they're out of
[3069.02 --> 3069.88]  one side of their mouth
[3069.88 --> 3070.54]  they're going to say,
[3070.72 --> 3070.84]  yeah,
[3070.90 --> 3071.80]  we care about the PC
[3071.80 --> 3072.82]  as a gaming platform.
[3072.82 --> 3072.84]  We care about PC gamers
[3072.84 --> 3073.52]  and all that, yeah.
[3073.52 --> 3074.12]  We do this,
[3074.26 --> 3075.54]  except we're going to,
[3075.64 --> 3075.74]  like,
[3075.84 --> 3076.46]  okay.
[3078.66 --> 3079.74]  It's been shown
[3079.74 --> 3080.72]  time and time again,
[3080.86 --> 3082.36]  the way to support gaming
[3082.36 --> 3083.72]  is to have
[3083.72 --> 3085.44]  a large platform
[3085.44 --> 3087.04]  of installed users
[3087.04 --> 3088.32]  for a game developer
[3088.32 --> 3089.16]  to target.
[3089.16 --> 3091.94]  That is how you support gaming.
[3092.26 --> 3093.46]  You do not support gaming
[3093.46 --> 3094.80]  by forcing people
[3094.80 --> 3095.98]  to buy a new OS
[3095.98 --> 3097.12]  on hardware
[3097.12 --> 3097.84]  that would otherwise
[3097.84 --> 3099.14]  be fully capable of it
[3099.14 --> 3100.62]  in order to take advantage
[3100.62 --> 3101.66]  of a new feature.
[3101.86 --> 3102.82]  That is how you get
[3102.82 --> 3103.84]  absolutely no one
[3103.84 --> 3104.74]  to give a shit
[3104.74 --> 3105.72]  about your new feature.
[3105.94 --> 3106.86]  That's what you achieve
[3106.86 --> 3107.50]  by doing that.
[3107.76 --> 3109.58]  So that's why I'm mad about this
[3109.58 --> 3110.58]  from a gaming perspective.
[3110.78 --> 3111.14]  But anyway,
[3111.26 --> 3111.88]  they are continuing
[3111.88 --> 3113.34]  to provide security updates
[3113.34 --> 3114.20]  until...
[3114.20 --> 3114.62]  2020.
[3114.82 --> 3116.12]  January 14, 2020
[3116.12 --> 3117.14]  or something like that.
[3117.24 --> 3118.44]  So yay for business.
[3118.44 --> 3118.96]  Also,
[3119.40 --> 3120.10]  business customers
[3120.10 --> 3122.02]  who pay for extended support
[3122.02 --> 3123.54]  can continue to get
[3123.54 --> 3124.76]  general updates,
[3125.02 --> 3126.32]  which to me is like,
[3126.58 --> 3127.24]  I get it.
[3127.88 --> 3128.96]  I understand why
[3128.96 --> 3129.68]  the business model
[3129.68 --> 3130.40]  works that way,
[3130.54 --> 3131.90]  but I'm still upset
[3131.90 --> 3133.14]  that you're developing
[3133.14 --> 3133.84]  all this stuff
[3133.84 --> 3134.68]  and then you're just...
[3134.68 --> 3135.36]  Not giving it to us?
[3135.44 --> 3136.46]  Not giving it to us.
[3136.46 --> 3137.10]  I wouldn't be surprised
[3137.10 --> 3137.78]  at all
[3137.78 --> 3139.18]  if someone creates
[3139.18 --> 3140.02]  some sort of module
[3140.02 --> 3140.56]  where you can get
[3140.56 --> 3141.00]  those updates.
[3142.84 --> 3143.62]  I don't know.
[3143.80 --> 3144.28]  Anyway...
[3144.28 --> 3145.26]  Not that that would even be
[3145.26 --> 3146.16]  legal or right
[3146.16 --> 3146.60]  or anything.
[3146.60 --> 3147.16]  I'm just saying
[3147.16 --> 3147.76]  it might exist.
[3147.76 --> 3149.26]  I think timing
[3149.26 --> 3149.90]  for different things
[3149.90 --> 3150.56]  is fairly interesting
[3150.56 --> 3151.62]  because we just read
[3151.62 --> 3152.62]  something about Windows 9
[3152.62 --> 3153.52]  which is where they said
[3153.52 --> 3155.00]  first half of 2015.
[3155.32 --> 3156.38]  Probably not as soon
[3156.38 --> 3157.58]  as January 13th.
[3158.86 --> 3159.24]  Yeah.
[3159.46 --> 3160.42]  So they're going to drop
[3160.42 --> 3161.70]  performance support for it
[3161.70 --> 3162.40]  and let you squirm
[3162.40 --> 3163.10]  for a little while
[3163.10 --> 3164.30]  and then release Windows 9.
[3165.98 --> 3166.84]  I bet you that's
[3166.84 --> 3167.46]  what's going to happen
[3167.46 --> 3168.14]  because they're trying
[3168.14 --> 3168.50]  to be like,
[3168.56 --> 3168.92]  yeah, we're trying
[3168.92 --> 3170.16]  to capture Windows 7 users.
[3170.40 --> 3170.92]  So they're trying
[3170.92 --> 3171.88]  to chop you off
[3171.88 --> 3172.38]  and then give you
[3172.38 --> 3173.02]  an alternative
[3173.02 --> 3173.92]  that you actually like
[3173.92 --> 3174.74]  instead of Windows 8
[3174.74 --> 3175.36]  which is trash.
[3176.50 --> 3177.14]  So there's that.
[3177.42 --> 3178.64]  Well, let's be fair.
[3178.98 --> 3180.24]  Let's not call it trash.
[3180.78 --> 3182.42]  Let's call it...
[3182.42 --> 3183.34]  Refined garbage?
[3183.52 --> 3183.98]  Not...
[3183.98 --> 3184.54]  Well, that's...
[3184.54 --> 3186.20]  That's not better.
[3186.86 --> 3187.64]  Compact waste?
[3187.98 --> 3188.98]  It's not waste.
[3189.08 --> 3189.58]  I mean, there are
[3189.58 --> 3190.46]  good things about it.
[3190.64 --> 3191.32]  You know there are
[3191.32 --> 3191.58]  good things about it.
[3191.58 --> 3192.24]  File transfer!
[3192.80 --> 3193.98]  And the task manager...
[3193.98 --> 3194.28]  Task manager!
[3194.40 --> 3195.16]  The task manager
[3195.16 --> 3195.72]  is much better.
[3195.72 --> 3196.60]  Nothing else!
[3197.22 --> 3197.96]  There must be
[3197.96 --> 3198.54]  something else.
[3198.68 --> 3199.40]  It's good at performing.
[3199.64 --> 3200.26]  It performs well.
[3200.32 --> 3201.44]  I hate that arrow's gone.
[3201.76 --> 3201.96]  Yeah.
[3202.04 --> 3203.28]  I hate that flat...
[3203.28 --> 3203.92]  I think it's ugly.
[3204.20 --> 3205.28]  I think it's really ugly.
[3205.28 --> 3206.00]  Windows 7 is beautiful.
[3206.42 --> 3207.24]  Yeah, it really is.
[3207.96 --> 3208.90]  Even the start button
[3208.90 --> 3209.22]  is like,
[3209.30 --> 3209.72]  dude, why is the
[3209.72 --> 3210.16]  whole thing white?
[3211.66 --> 3212.02]  Yeah.
[3212.26 --> 3212.90]  Because it's not
[3212.90 --> 3213.60]  really a start button.
[3213.78 --> 3214.12]  That's why the
[3214.12 --> 3214.58]  whole thing's white.
[3215.18 --> 3215.54]  Yeah.
[3215.78 --> 3216.02]  Okay.
[3216.34 --> 3217.38]  So let's...
[3217.38 --> 3217.78]  Okay.
[3218.02 --> 3218.84]  I'd like to say
[3218.84 --> 3219.24]  that we're going to
[3219.24 --> 3220.00]  go easy on Microsoft
[3220.00 --> 3220.94]  for a little bit here.
[3221.18 --> 3221.58]  It's funny.
[3221.66 --> 3222.22]  I got called
[3222.22 --> 3223.28]  the ultimate Microsoft
[3223.28 --> 3224.76]  fanboy by someone
[3224.76 --> 3226.42]  on my Surface 3 review.
[3226.92 --> 3227.48]  And I was like,
[3227.60 --> 3227.96]  really?
[3228.60 --> 3229.46]  Your Surface 3 review?
[3229.48 --> 3230.18]  Yeah, I know, right?
[3230.26 --> 3230.62]  What?
[3231.12 --> 3231.50]  It's like,
[3231.52 --> 3232.38]  people can decide
[3232.38 --> 3233.30]  that I've sold out
[3233.30 --> 3234.38]  no matter what I say.
[3234.92 --> 3236.10]  Didn't you rip it apart?
[3236.48 --> 3237.26]  I can be like,
[3237.68 --> 3238.92]  you know what's garbage?
[3239.10 --> 3239.50]  Minecraft.
[3239.84 --> 3240.34]  And people will be like,
[3240.36 --> 3241.40]  yeah, Mojang's sold out.
[3241.64 --> 3242.20]  Why do you like
[3242.20 --> 3243.12]  Minecraft so much?
[3243.46 --> 3244.74]  Yeah, I bet Notch
[3244.74 --> 3245.66]  gave him $5,000
[3245.66 --> 3246.44]  to say that.
[3247.30 --> 3247.74]  Anyway,
[3248.30 --> 3249.98]  so this is a big problem.
[3250.22 --> 3251.02]  This is just
[3251.02 --> 3251.76]  unbelievable.
[3251.76 --> 3252.10]  Oh, yeah.
[3252.48 --> 3253.36]  Original article
[3253.36 --> 3254.46]  here on Forbes.
[3254.60 --> 3255.40]  We're getting more and more
[3255.40 --> 3256.22]  of our gaming news
[3256.22 --> 3256.84]  from Forbes.
[3257.24 --> 3257.92]  We were even talking
[3257.92 --> 3258.92]  about this a little while ago
[3258.92 --> 3259.50]  where I was like,
[3259.50 --> 3260.48]  what is Forbes doing
[3260.48 --> 3261.38]  video card reviews?
[3261.54 --> 3261.80]  I know.
[3261.88 --> 3262.58]  And now it's like,
[3262.64 --> 3262.98]  okay,
[3263.32 --> 3263.94]  good article.
[3264.74 --> 3265.84]  In this article,
[3266.34 --> 3267.50]  he goes like,
[3267.70 --> 3267.90]  yeah,
[3267.96 --> 3268.94]  I think games are fine
[3268.94 --> 3269.56]  at 30 FPS.
[3270.24 --> 3270.68]  And I'm just like,
[3270.74 --> 3270.96]  yeah,
[3271.10 --> 3272.24]  why does Forbes
[3272.24 --> 3272.96]  even have news?
[3274.30 --> 3274.66]  Well,
[3274.70 --> 3275.42]  I thought other than that
[3275.42 --> 3275.86]  the article is good.
[3275.86 --> 3276.62]  Right here.
[3276.62 --> 3277.44]  Personally,
[3277.60 --> 3278.20]  I can tell the difference
[3278.20 --> 3278.90]  between 1080p
[3278.90 --> 3280.10]  and 720p
[3280.10 --> 3281.06]  as well as 30 FPS
[3281.06 --> 3281.80]  and 60 FPS,
[3282.14 --> 3283.00]  but I don't really care.
[3283.10 --> 3283.54]  In the past,
[3283.58 --> 3284.40]  I've raised the ire
[3284.40 --> 3285.20]  of the internet
[3285.20 --> 3286.06]  by suggesting
[3286.06 --> 3286.66]  that 30 FPS
[3286.66 --> 3287.26]  was better
[3287.26 --> 3288.04]  for some games
[3288.04 --> 3288.66]  and opinion
[3288.66 --> 3289.46]  that I stand by.
[3289.78 --> 3290.16]  Well,
[3290.26 --> 3291.44]  I don't care about you.
[3291.48 --> 3291.64]  Yeah,
[3291.72 --> 3292.10]  so anyway,
[3292.22 --> 3293.26]  the point is
[3293.26 --> 3294.44]  blah, blah, blah,
[3294.60 --> 3295.54]  resolution gate
[3295.54 --> 3296.00]  or whatever.
[3296.12 --> 3296.54]  Everyone wants
[3296.54 --> 3297.30]  to call everything
[3297.30 --> 3298.14]  something gate.
[3298.14 --> 3298.84]  It's very goofy.
[3300.08 --> 3300.36]  Merc.
[3300.36 --> 3302.20]  So anyway,
[3302.36 --> 3303.66]  Xbox Marketing Chief
[3303.66 --> 3304.40]  Harvey Eagle
[3304.40 --> 3305.22]  and that should be
[3305.22 --> 3306.18]  your first clue.
[3306.84 --> 3307.80]  Marketing Chief.
[3308.34 --> 3309.52]  If you had to market
[3309.52 --> 3310.04]  the Xbox,
[3310.38 --> 3311.20]  what would you do
[3311.20 --> 3311.70]  other than
[3311.70 --> 3312.74]  downplay resolution
[3312.74 --> 3314.44]  and graphical horsepower?
[3315.40 --> 3316.46]  Marketing Chief
[3316.46 --> 3317.38]  didn't deny
[3317.38 --> 3318.22]  the spec differences
[3318.22 --> 3319.04]  but argued
[3319.04 --> 3320.10]  that it is really hard
[3320.10 --> 3321.12]  to tell the difference.
[3321.12 --> 3321.94]  If you put
[3321.94 --> 3322.84]  third-party games
[3322.84 --> 3323.56]  side by side
[3323.56 --> 3324.02]  that are running
[3324.02 --> 3324.90]  at slightly different
[3324.90 --> 3326.02]  resolutions or frame rates.
[3326.22 --> 3326.36]  Now,
[3326.90 --> 3327.62]  to be clear,
[3328.26 --> 3329.34]  1080p
[3329.34 --> 3330.78]  and 792p
[3330.78 --> 3332.06]  or even 900p
[3332.06 --> 3333.06]  and 792p
[3333.06 --> 3333.74]  are not slightly
[3333.74 --> 3334.62]  different frame rates.
[3335.12 --> 3335.40]  Also,
[3335.60 --> 3336.00]  there are
[3336.00 --> 3337.72]  resolutions rather.
[3338.16 --> 3338.50]  Also,
[3338.76 --> 3340.06]  there are other issues here.
[3340.46 --> 3341.06]  The fact that
[3341.06 --> 3341.84]  you're not running
[3341.84 --> 3343.00]  at a native resolution
[3343.00 --> 3344.20]  means that the image
[3344.20 --> 3345.16]  is not as crisp.
[3345.74 --> 3346.54]  It means that
[3346.54 --> 3347.80]  you have to interpolate
[3347.80 --> 3349.04]  which is bad.
[3349.30 --> 3350.10]  It's terrible.
[3350.32 --> 3350.54]  Anyway,
[3351.02 --> 3351.56]  if you put the
[3351.56 --> 3351.98]  blah, blah, blah
[3351.98 --> 3352.82]  side by side
[3352.82 --> 3353.80]  unless you're using
[3353.80 --> 3354.52]  a screen that's
[3354.52 --> 3356.16]  more than 60 inches big
[3356.16 --> 3357.30]  I defy you
[3357.30 --> 3358.48]  to really see the difference.
[3358.48 --> 3359.54]  I personally struggle
[3359.54 --> 3360.46]  to see the difference.
[3363.14 --> 3365.98]  I had a debate
[3365.98 --> 3366.76]  about this with someone
[3366.76 --> 3367.84]  and one of the points
[3367.84 --> 3368.40]  that I brought up
[3368.40 --> 3369.30]  was that we seem
[3369.30 --> 3370.22]  to be going backwards
[3370.22 --> 3371.68]  and people are talking
[3371.68 --> 3372.64]  about how on PS2
[3372.64 --> 3373.34]  they're playing games
[3373.34 --> 3374.00]  at 60fps.
[3375.28 --> 3375.58]  I'm like,
[3375.66 --> 3375.90]  yeah,
[3376.26 --> 3377.10]  that should be
[3377.10 --> 3378.08]  a standard now.
[3378.48 --> 3379.50]  We should not
[3379.50 --> 3380.36]  have to be having
[3380.36 --> 3380.86]  this debate
[3380.86 --> 3381.22]  at this point.
[3381.22 --> 3381.68]  It's funny because
[3381.68 --> 3382.88]  Android games
[3382.88 --> 3383.62]  are like,
[3383.96 --> 3384.20]  yeah,
[3384.34 --> 3384.76]  G3,
[3385.16 --> 3386.04]  let's run it
[3386.04 --> 3386.98]  at 1440p.
[3388.58 --> 3391.52]  No wonder.
[3391.88 --> 3392.54]  You know what?
[3392.96 --> 3393.40]  You know how
[3393.40 --> 3394.54]  Nvidia has talked
[3394.54 --> 3395.12]  so much
[3395.12 --> 3396.38]  about how
[3396.38 --> 3397.90]  their Tegra chips
[3397.90 --> 3399.50]  and mobile gaming
[3399.50 --> 3400.32]  and the console
[3400.32 --> 3400.96]  experience
[3400.96 --> 3401.90]  and all that
[3401.90 --> 3402.82]  with the mobile chips
[3402.82 --> 3403.46]  and they're making
[3403.46 --> 3404.08]  such a big deal
[3404.08 --> 3404.50]  out of that.
[3404.90 --> 3405.14]  I mean,
[3405.26 --> 3405.70]  you've got to
[3405.70 --> 3406.72]  imagine
[3406.72 --> 3408.36]  how aware
[3408.36 --> 3409.58]  a company like that
[3409.58 --> 3410.36]  is of the kind
[3410.36 --> 3410.80]  of crap
[3410.80 --> 3411.36]  that was going
[3411.36 --> 3412.32]  on with Watch Dogs
[3412.32 --> 3413.52]  and how frustrated
[3413.52 --> 3414.18]  they are
[3414.18 --> 3414.82]  by the fact
[3414.82 --> 3415.42]  that they rely
[3415.42 --> 3416.58]  on these partners
[3416.58 --> 3417.78]  to create
[3417.78 --> 3419.06]  great PC games.
[3419.48 --> 3420.30]  No wonder
[3420.30 --> 3421.86]  they want to just
[3421.86 --> 3422.96]  throw development
[3422.96 --> 3423.54]  resources
[3423.54 --> 3424.24]  at mobile.
[3424.24 --> 3425.04]  At the Android guys
[3425.04 --> 3425.40]  that are like,
[3425.58 --> 3426.24]  like you just said,
[3426.32 --> 3426.58]  yeah,
[3427.12 --> 3428.38]  1440p.
[3428.64 --> 3429.42]  Where they're actually
[3429.42 --> 3430.08]  trying to push
[3430.08 --> 3430.58]  the envelope
[3430.58 --> 3431.62]  and where the technology
[3431.62 --> 3432.70]  is actually improving.
[3432.94 --> 3434.38]  I hate Android games
[3434.38 --> 3434.60]  though.
[3435.02 --> 3436.06]  They just all suck.
[3436.98 --> 3437.14]  Like,
[3437.20 --> 3438.36]  I was looking through,
[3438.56 --> 3438.82]  okay,
[3438.90 --> 3439.54]  I haven't looked at
[3439.54 --> 3440.22]  like any of the
[3440.22 --> 3441.18]  actual ones on the store
[3441.18 --> 3442.14]  so that might help
[3442.14 --> 3442.64]  me a little bit.
[3442.74 --> 3442.88]  Right.
[3443.02 --> 3443.86]  But I was looking
[3443.86 --> 3444.76]  through my Humble Bundle
[3444.76 --> 3445.40]  Android games
[3445.40 --> 3446.10]  which I have a ton
[3446.10 --> 3447.16]  of the other day
[3447.16 --> 3447.60]  because I was just
[3447.60 --> 3448.74]  bored and waiting
[3448.74 --> 3449.20]  somewhere.
[3449.60 --> 3449.92]  I was like,
[3449.98 --> 3450.22]  wow,
[3450.32 --> 3451.12]  I don't want to play
[3451.12 --> 3452.08]  any of these.
[3452.30 --> 3452.76]  I know.
[3452.88 --> 3453.64]  Like at all.
[3454.10 --> 3457.02]  We need more developers
[3457.02 --> 3458.60]  to figure out a way
[3458.60 --> 3459.66]  to make Android games
[3459.66 --> 3460.44]  much more profitable.
[3460.66 --> 3460.84]  I mean,
[3460.92 --> 3461.60]  Square's done it.
[3461.70 --> 3462.26]  What did they charge?
[3462.34 --> 3463.60]  $14.99 for their
[3463.60 --> 3464.60]  Final Fantasy remakes
[3464.60 --> 3464.96]  on Android?
[3465.64 --> 3465.86]  Like,
[3465.90 --> 3466.72]  we've seen
[3466.72 --> 3467.94]  $15,
[3468.06 --> 3469.30]  $20 Android games
[3469.30 --> 3469.72]  before
[3469.72 --> 3470.72]  but it's not
[3470.72 --> 3471.54]  until that
[3471.54 --> 3472.22]  becomes more
[3472.22 --> 3472.94]  commonplace
[3472.94 --> 3473.98]  and sales of games
[3473.98 --> 3474.40]  like that
[3474.40 --> 3474.98]  become more
[3474.98 --> 3475.42]  mainstream
[3475.42 --> 3476.26]  that we're going
[3476.26 --> 3476.94]  to see developers
[3476.94 --> 3477.86]  really invest
[3477.86 --> 3478.98]  properly in the
[3478.98 --> 3479.76]  stuff that matters
[3479.76 --> 3480.38]  like storyline.
[3480.52 --> 3480.60]  Like,
[3480.80 --> 3481.86]  I had a lot of fun
[3481.86 --> 3482.96]  playing Reaper.
[3483.62 --> 3484.26]  Did you ever try it?
[3484.34 --> 3484.50]  No.
[3484.78 --> 3485.74]  It's great on shield
[3485.74 --> 3486.56]  with a controller.
[3486.74 --> 3488.06]  It's a total blast.
[3488.16 --> 3488.68]  It's kind of like
[3488.68 --> 3489.36]  a side-scrolling
[3489.36 --> 3490.60]  level-based fighting game
[3490.60 --> 3492.42]  but there's no depth
[3492.42 --> 3493.40]  to it at all.
[3493.50 --> 3494.12]  It's the kind of thing
[3494.12 --> 3494.96]  that you play in bed
[3494.96 --> 3495.64]  while you're drifting
[3495.64 --> 3496.38]  off to sleep
[3496.38 --> 3497.26]  and then like
[3497.26 --> 3497.98]  the last fight
[3497.98 --> 3498.72]  you die
[3498.72 --> 3499.44]  because you actually
[3499.44 --> 3499.92]  fell asleep.
[3499.92 --> 3501.52]  It's that kind of game
[3501.52 --> 3503.40]  and until they cost more
[3503.40 --> 3503.84]  we're just
[3503.84 --> 3505.78]  it's just the rules.
[3506.70 --> 3508.18]  Until you pay for something
[3508.18 --> 3509.32]  no one's going to make it
[3509.32 --> 3510.26]  and the other way around.
[3510.78 --> 3511.98]  And one thing I find
[3511.98 --> 3512.68]  to be a problem too
[3512.68 --> 3513.38]  is there's a lot of people
[3513.38 --> 3514.42]  developing things
[3514.42 --> 3515.40]  that actually look like
[3515.40 --> 3516.52]  genuinely interesting games
[3516.52 --> 3517.86]  and then
[3517.86 --> 3519.00]  you start playing it
[3519.00 --> 3519.32]  and you're like
[3519.32 --> 3521.18]  this shouldn't be on a phone.
[3521.80 --> 3522.50]  Don't you have a shield
[3522.50 --> 3522.80]  right now?
[3523.20 --> 3523.54]  I do.
[3523.78 --> 3524.30]  Yeah, okay.
[3524.56 --> 3525.82]  But like I'm talking more
[3525.82 --> 3526.64]  if I'm like waiting
[3526.64 --> 3527.48]  at a bus stop or something.
[3527.48 --> 3527.68]  Right.
[3528.28 --> 3529.08]  You know, it's funny.
[3529.18 --> 3530.78]  I have almost no games
[3530.78 --> 3531.80]  installed on my phone anymore.
[3532.36 --> 3533.58]  I used to have like
[3533.58 --> 3535.02]  at least 10 games
[3535.02 --> 3535.68]  installed on my phone
[3535.68 --> 3536.44]  at any given time.
[3536.56 --> 3538.20]  But you play enough
[3538.20 --> 3538.72]  Fruit Ninja
[3538.72 --> 3540.14]  and you get to the point
[3540.14 --> 3540.86]  where it's just not
[3540.86 --> 3541.64]  entertaining anymore.
[3541.76 --> 3541.94]  Yeah.
[3542.30 --> 3542.90]  For me anyway.
[3543.00 --> 3543.46]  One of my problems
[3543.46 --> 3543.98]  right now is that
[3543.98 --> 3544.98]  I am using a Moto X.
[3545.12 --> 3546.14]  When I had my G2
[3546.14 --> 3547.00]  I had a lot more games
[3547.00 --> 3547.28]  installed.
[3547.52 --> 3548.32]  The screen's a lot bigger.
[3548.72 --> 3549.00]  Right.
[3549.00 --> 3550.20]  So it felt like
[3550.20 --> 3550.82]  it's so
[3550.82 --> 3551.62]  look at my thumbs.
[3552.48 --> 3553.18]  Yeah, I played
[3553.18 --> 3554.24]  Jetpack Joyride
[3554.24 --> 3555.32]  a lot more
[3555.32 --> 3556.50]  back when I was
[3556.50 --> 3557.44]  using the iPad 2.
[3557.64 --> 3558.28]  Jetpack Joyride
[3558.28 --> 3558.84]  was pretty alright.
[3559.34 --> 3560.90]  But the problem for me
[3560.90 --> 3562.32]  is that for whatever reason
[3562.32 --> 3563.04]  my account didn't
[3563.04 --> 3563.82]  sync all my items
[3563.82 --> 3564.18]  and stuff.
[3564.28 --> 3564.76]  So I had like
[3564.76 --> 3565.68]  the gold cuddles
[3565.68 --> 3566.30]  and the gold
[3566.30 --> 3567.00]  like everything
[3567.00 --> 3567.76]  and I had like
[3567.76 --> 3568.54]  every Jetpack.
[3568.92 --> 3569.64]  So for me
[3569.64 --> 3570.42]  whenever they were
[3570.42 --> 3571.12]  releasing updates
[3571.12 --> 3571.62]  because I refused
[3571.62 --> 3572.34]  to pay for stuff
[3572.34 --> 3572.80]  like that.
[3572.94 --> 3573.04]  Yeah.
[3573.12 --> 3573.78]  So I had actually
[3573.78 --> 3574.94]  earned through coins
[3574.94 --> 3575.76]  every single item
[3575.76 --> 3576.14]  in the game.
[3576.22 --> 3576.50]  That's what I was
[3576.50 --> 3576.92]  working on too.
[3576.98 --> 3577.52]  I didn't pay for anything.
[3577.72 --> 3578.90]  And then as they
[3578.90 --> 3580.04]  were rolling out new stuff
[3580.04 --> 3580.76]  I would always have
[3580.76 --> 3581.68]  kind of new stuff to buy
[3581.68 --> 3582.78]  so it was my can game
[3582.78 --> 3583.02]  right?
[3583.28 --> 3583.36]  Yeah.
[3583.44 --> 3584.38]  And then my account
[3584.38 --> 3584.90]  didn't sync.
[3585.02 --> 3586.22]  I upgraded to iOS 7
[3586.22 --> 3586.82]  and all my stuff
[3586.82 --> 3587.14]  was gone.
[3587.22 --> 3587.54]  I'm like yeah
[3587.54 --> 3588.40]  I'm not gonna do that
[3588.40 --> 3588.60]  again.
[3588.80 --> 3589.66]  I switched phones.
[3589.84 --> 3590.38]  I'm not gonna
[3590.38 --> 3591.80]  you take away
[3591.80 --> 3592.58]  my coin magnet
[3592.58 --> 3593.32]  you might as well
[3593.32 --> 3594.06]  cut off my balls.
[3595.54 --> 3595.94]  Okay.
[3596.32 --> 3597.80]  GTX Titan 2.
[3598.60 --> 3599.74]  This was posted
[3599.74 --> 3601.66]  like at like
[3601.66 --> 3603.48]  4.10 or something
[3603.48 --> 3604.96]  an hour ago.
[3605.84 --> 3606.72]  Someone linked this
[3606.72 --> 3607.28]  to us and I was
[3607.28 --> 3608.42]  just like oh god
[3608.42 --> 3609.64]  get it in the dock.
[3610.04 --> 3612.12]  Here is the rumor.
[3612.72 --> 3613.52]  An NVIDIA product
[3613.52 --> 3614.36]  going by the description
[3614.36 --> 3616.00]  of GM200A1 graphics
[3616.00 --> 3616.80]  processor has been
[3616.80 --> 3617.10]  spotted.
[3617.32 --> 3618.06]  This is kind of a
[3618.06 --> 3618.72]  new thing hey?
[3619.26 --> 3619.46]  What?
[3619.82 --> 3620.26]  Couriers.
[3620.56 --> 3620.76]  Yeah.
[3620.88 --> 3622.46]  Seeing the documents
[3622.46 --> 3623.96]  because legally they
[3623.96 --> 3625.02]  have to say what's in
[3625.02 --> 3626.12]  a package in order to
[3626.12 --> 3626.62]  ship it somewhere.
[3627.06 --> 3628.24]  So the couriers that
[3628.24 --> 3630.16]  sit between NVIDIA's
[3630.16 --> 3631.80]  production facility for
[3631.80 --> 3632.68]  their engineering samples
[3632.68 --> 3633.50]  and their testing
[3633.50 --> 3635.06]  facility are apparently
[3635.06 --> 3636.74]  picking up on graphics
[3636.74 --> 3637.42]  card shipments.
[3637.42 --> 3638.52]  So it's going to be
[3638.52 --> 3641.54]  called GM200A1 graphics
[3641.54 --> 3642.24]  processor.
[3643.58 --> 3644.30]  The A1 stepping
[3644.30 --> 3645.08]  signifies the
[3645.08 --> 3646.02]  pre-production status
[3646.02 --> 3646.70]  of the chip and it
[3646.70 --> 3647.42]  will be upgraded to an
[3647.42 --> 3648.62]  A2 stepping before
[3648.62 --> 3649.22]  being pushed into
[3649.22 --> 3649.78]  mass production for
[3649.78 --> 3650.48]  the consumer market.
[3651.12 --> 3652.00]  It is rumored to
[3652.00 --> 3653.36]  feature over 4,000
[3653.36 --> 3654.26]  CUDA cores and a
[3654.26 --> 3655.14]  widened memory bus
[3655.14 --> 3656.22]  of 512 bits.
[3656.32 --> 3657.76]  I find that very
[3657.76 --> 3658.72]  hard to believe.
[3659.38 --> 3661.14]  NVIDIA has avoided
[3661.14 --> 3663.82]  at every turn going
[3663.82 --> 3666.08]  to 512 bit as often
[3666.08 --> 3666.90]  as they can,
[3667.02 --> 3668.08]  every time they can.
[3668.22 --> 3668.84]  They've gone as wide
[3668.84 --> 3670.60]  as 384 and seem to be
[3670.60 --> 3671.28]  okay with it.
[3671.48 --> 3672.48]  But it is much more
[3672.48 --> 3673.48]  expensive to put a
[3673.48 --> 3674.86]  wider memory bus on a
[3674.86 --> 3675.08]  chip.
[3675.16 --> 3675.70]  You have to do more
[3675.70 --> 3676.48]  contact points, you
[3676.48 --> 3676.94]  have to do more
[3676.94 --> 3677.54]  internal routing.
[3677.66 --> 3678.40]  The design is much
[3678.40 --> 3679.84]  more difficult and if
[3679.84 --> 3680.82]  they don't have to do
[3680.82 --> 3681.80]  it, then they don't
[3681.80 --> 3682.28]  have to.
[3682.42 --> 3683.88]  And with DDR4 coming
[3683.88 --> 3685.46]  so soon and a
[3685.46 --> 3687.66]  derivative of GDDR based
[3687.66 --> 3689.28]  on DDR4 presumably in
[3689.28 --> 3691.46]  the works, I don't know
[3691.46 --> 3692.50]  that they would need
[3692.50 --> 3693.76]  to widen the bus that
[3693.76 --> 3694.72]  much more.
[3694.88 --> 3695.66]  I mean, it's not like
[3695.66 --> 3697.62]  we're limited on the
[3697.62 --> 3698.46]  current generation
[3698.46 --> 3700.34]  Kepler products by the
[3700.34 --> 3701.44]  memory bus that much.
[3701.50 --> 3702.18]  Memory overclocking
[3702.18 --> 3702.88]  doesn't do a whole lot
[3702.88 --> 3703.44]  for performance.
[3703.68 --> 3705.22]  So we'll see.
[3705.42 --> 3706.40]  Anyway, so it's rumored
[3706.40 --> 3707.82]  to have a 512 bit bus
[3707.82 --> 3708.94]  given the size of the
[3708.94 --> 3710.32]  28 nanometer process.
[3710.46 --> 3711.60]  This new GPU will be
[3711.60 --> 3712.94]  very, very large.
[3713.02 --> 3713.78]  That's another thing is
[3713.78 --> 3714.80]  NVIDIA doesn't give up
[3714.80 --> 3715.74]  margin easily.
[3716.40 --> 3717.86]  So telling NVIDIA,
[3718.10 --> 3720.02]  hey, just for, there's
[3720.02 --> 3721.44]  no competition that
[3721.44 --> 3722.28]  has a faster card
[3722.28 --> 3723.66]  than you, but you
[3723.66 --> 3725.20]  should price this card
[3725.20 --> 3726.56]  at $9.99 just like
[3726.56 --> 3728.06]  the old Titan and you
[3728.06 --> 3729.84]  should make the chip
[3729.84 --> 3730.30]  bigger.
[3731.44 --> 3732.04]  Like, they're going to
[3732.04 --> 3733.80]  be like, okay, why?
[3734.62 --> 3735.62]  Maybe we'll just do a
[3735.62 --> 3736.82]  black edition instead.
[3737.90 --> 3738.82]  Like they did.
[3739.06 --> 3739.94]  Where it's the same
[3739.94 --> 3741.24]  chip and they can still
[3741.24 --> 3741.92]  sell it for the same
[3741.92 --> 3742.10]  price.
[3742.16 --> 3742.92]  So I don't know.
[3743.00 --> 3743.76]  I'll be interested to
[3743.76 --> 3745.54]  see how that shakes
[3745.54 --> 3745.82]  down.
[3746.50 --> 3746.96]  Ghost and I were kind
[3746.96 --> 3747.48]  of screwing around with
[3747.48 --> 3748.14]  the dock a little bit.
[3748.22 --> 3749.62]  I deleted a lot of it,
[3749.68 --> 3750.60]  but apparently not all
[3750.60 --> 3750.82]  of it.
[3750.92 --> 3752.44]  We had four or five
[3752.44 --> 3753.44]  of that article and
[3753.44 --> 3754.30]  we just titled it like
[3754.30 --> 3756.28]  GTX Titan 3, GTX Titan 4,
[3756.44 --> 3757.42]  GTX Titan 5.
[3757.58 --> 3758.40]  We just changed every
[3758.40 --> 3759.50]  single article to like
[3759.50 --> 3762.54]  GK 310, GK 410, GK 510,
[3762.84 --> 3765.20]  999, 999, 999, 999.
[3765.62 --> 3766.50]  So it's expected to
[3766.50 --> 3769.96]  launch in the first half
[3769.96 --> 3771.36]  of 2015, which is
[3771.36 --> 3772.30]  probably a pretty safe
[3772.30 --> 3772.52]  bet.
[3772.58 --> 3773.16]  So we'll see how that
[3773.16 --> 3773.38]  goes.
[3773.84 --> 3774.94]  I haven't heard anything
[3774.94 --> 3775.42]  about it.
[3775.78 --> 3777.80]  What I can say is that
[3777.80 --> 3779.28]  and I really, okay, to be
[3779.28 --> 3782.12]  clear, I do not think it's
[3782.12 --> 3783.38]  related to Titan 2.
[3783.50 --> 3784.24]  I mean, the fact that
[3784.24 --> 3785.78]  they're shipping A1
[3785.78 --> 3787.50]  silicon allegedly between
[3787.50 --> 3789.16]  testing facilities means
[3789.16 --> 3791.80]  it's nowhere even close to
[3791.80 --> 3792.38]  hitting the market.
[3792.80 --> 3793.84]  But I actually have a
[3793.84 --> 3794.72]  meeting with Nvidia on
[3794.72 --> 3795.00]  Monday.
[3795.08 --> 3795.82]  I'll be flying down to
[3795.82 --> 3796.22]  San Fran.
[3796.42 --> 3798.00]  So it'll be interesting to
[3798.00 --> 3798.60]  find out what that's
[3798.60 --> 3798.82]  about.
[3798.82 --> 3799.88]  There's been a lot of
[3799.88 --> 3800.90]  rumor mill stuff going
[3800.90 --> 3801.92]  around about Nvidia lately.
[3801.92 --> 3802.98]  They're being really
[3802.98 --> 3803.92]  cagey about this.
[3804.12 --> 3806.22]  So not only am I, am I,
[3806.34 --> 3808.38]  um, like they wouldn't
[3808.38 --> 3809.02]  even tell me what the
[3809.02 --> 3810.40]  meeting's about at all.
[3810.66 --> 3812.06]  They're just like, get on
[3812.06 --> 3812.48]  a plane.
[3812.74 --> 3815.78]  And I'm like, okay, you
[3815.78 --> 3816.28]  have a meeting.
[3816.28 --> 3818.58]  And I'm like, okay, may I
[3818.58 --> 3819.32]  know what it's about?
[3819.46 --> 3820.58]  My wife has an ultrasound
[3820.58 --> 3821.98]  that day and I'd rather not
[3821.98 --> 3822.42]  miss it.
[3822.54 --> 3824.08]  And they're like, I'm
[3824.08 --> 3825.12]  like, can you, can you
[3825.12 --> 3826.02]  brief me over the phone?
[3826.10 --> 3826.96]  They're like, no.
[3827.88 --> 3831.40]  I'm like, okay, can we do
[3831.40 --> 3832.10]  a different day?
[3832.74 --> 3833.10]  Yes.
[3833.52 --> 3833.74]  Oh.
[3834.06 --> 3835.02]  So it was, it was going
[3835.02 --> 3836.00]  to be on the Tuesday and
[3836.00 --> 3836.82]  I moved it to the Monday.
[3837.06 --> 3837.28]  Oh.
[3837.44 --> 3838.26]  So I can go to the
[3838.26 --> 3839.12]  ultrasound on Tuesday.
[3839.24 --> 3839.58]  That works.
[3839.70 --> 3840.82]  But, uh, but anyway, they
[3840.82 --> 3841.68]  won't tell me what it's
[3841.68 --> 3842.94]  about at all.
[3843.14 --> 3844.22]  And everything they tell
[3844.22 --> 3845.96]  me is embargoed until a
[3845.96 --> 3847.06]  date that presumably is
[3847.06 --> 3847.86]  also embargoed.
[3848.08 --> 3849.32]  So don't expect to hear
[3849.32 --> 3850.32]  anything about this from
[3850.32 --> 3850.54]  me.
[3850.66 --> 3850.76]  At all.
[3850.76 --> 3851.86]  Other than that, I have
[3851.86 --> 3852.52]  a meeting with them and
[3852.52 --> 3853.20]  I don't know what it's
[3853.20 --> 3853.52]  about.
[3853.96 --> 3854.36]  Damn it.
[3854.48 --> 3855.40]  They didn't even respond
[3855.40 --> 3856.54]  to my question of like,
[3856.60 --> 3857.08]  what's it about?
[3857.86 --> 3859.34]  Just, just, that's the
[3859.34 --> 3859.80]  best.
[3859.80 --> 3861.08]  That's definitely the
[3861.08 --> 3861.38]  best.
[3861.50 --> 3861.98]  I love Nvidia.
[3862.08 --> 3863.02]  Well, I mean, my contact
[3863.02 --> 3864.34]  there has been at Nvidia
[3864.34 --> 3866.22]  for like 10 or 12 years or
[3866.22 --> 3866.96]  something like that.
[3867.08 --> 3868.54]  So he knows what's up at
[3868.54 --> 3868.88]  Nvidia.
[3869.12 --> 3869.92]  You do not leak
[3869.92 --> 3870.40]  information.
[3870.40 --> 3871.06]  It's like Apple.
[3871.28 --> 3872.68]  Like if it's something where
[3872.68 --> 3873.92]  he's allowed to tell me, he
[3873.92 --> 3875.22]  will, like he and I have a
[3875.22 --> 3876.46]  pretty good rapport, but if
[3876.46 --> 3877.28]  it's something where he
[3877.28 --> 3878.32]  can't, he's told not to
[3878.32 --> 3879.84]  tell anyone, nobody will
[3879.84 --> 3880.12]  know.
[3880.24 --> 3881.28]  And that will be how it
[3881.28 --> 3881.50]  is.
[3882.54 --> 3883.96]  They are, they're like,
[3884.22 --> 3885.28]  they're pretty crazy.
[3885.98 --> 3887.38]  At Apple, sometimes even the
[3887.38 --> 3888.24]  engineers don't really know
[3888.24 --> 3888.84]  what's going on.
[3889.30 --> 3890.36]  It's pretty insane.
[3890.74 --> 3891.56]  Or at least that's how it
[3891.56 --> 3892.58]  was when Jobs was around.
[3893.50 --> 3893.96]  All right.
[3894.02 --> 3896.08]  So this, this is a
[3896.08 --> 3897.22]  controversial topic.
[3897.90 --> 3898.96]  Actually, speaking of
[3898.96 --> 3900.22]  controversial topics, why
[3900.22 --> 3901.66]  don't we go ahead and do
[3901.66 --> 3903.70]  our sponsor spots?
[3904.38 --> 3904.52]  Woo!
[3905.82 --> 3907.06]  It's a Dollar Shave Club.
[3907.62 --> 3909.90]  By now, I hope most of you
[3909.90 --> 3910.82]  understand what Dollar
[3910.82 --> 3912.30]  Shave Club is.
[3912.30 --> 3913.86]  So basically, I'm going to
[3913.86 --> 3914.74]  take a bit of a slightly
[3914.74 --> 3916.42]  different angle on it this
[3916.42 --> 3916.76]  time.
[3917.38 --> 3918.38]  Do you shave?
[3921.02 --> 3921.42]  Okay.
[3921.56 --> 3921.98]  So I'm going to let that
[3921.98 --> 3922.58]  sink in for a moment.
[3923.70 --> 3925.64]  Do you shave with razors?
[3926.78 --> 3927.54]  I'm going to let that sink
[3927.54 --> 3928.08]  in for a moment.
[3928.72 --> 3930.30]  If you shave with razors,
[3930.66 --> 3932.04]  how much do you pay per
[3932.04 --> 3932.36]  month?
[3932.56 --> 3933.96]  And how inconvenient is it
[3933.96 --> 3935.20]  to go to the store and buy
[3935.20 --> 3937.32]  them and all of that stuff?
[3938.94 --> 3939.34]  Okay.
[3939.34 --> 3940.44]  So I'm letting you guys
[3940.44 --> 3941.24]  figure all this out.
[3941.60 --> 3943.66]  If the answer was more
[3943.66 --> 3945.04]  than, here we go, I'm just
[3945.04 --> 3945.74]  going to load up Dollar
[3945.74 --> 3946.52]  Shave Club's site.
[3946.62 --> 3947.38]  I'm going to bring it up
[3947.38 --> 3949.50]  on my, there's Mike.
[3949.58 --> 3950.76]  Look how crazy he looks.
[3951.28 --> 3952.62]  I saw him in an interview
[3952.62 --> 3954.28]  and he looked a lot less
[3954.28 --> 3956.36]  deranged and it made him
[3956.36 --> 3957.42]  less, less frightening to
[3957.42 --> 3957.64]  me.
[3958.06 --> 3958.56]  But, um.
[3958.58 --> 3959.38]  Is he was frightening in
[3959.38 --> 3959.86]  that commercial?
[3960.64 --> 3961.70]  With the, like, the
[3961.70 --> 3962.56]  machete and everything?
[3963.84 --> 3964.72]  Yeah, but he does it so
[3964.72 --> 3965.32]  poorly, he doesn't even
[3965.32 --> 3965.76]  cut the tape.
[3965.94 --> 3966.70]  I know, but he's, like,
[3966.80 --> 3967.22]  aggressive.
[3968.12 --> 3969.06]  I mean, just because, okay,
[3969.06 --> 3969.90]  would you, okay, so would,
[3969.98 --> 3971.20]  just because I can't cut
[3971.20 --> 3972.16]  tape with a machete, you
[3972.16 --> 3972.84]  would let me swing it at
[3972.84 --> 3972.92]  you?
[3972.98 --> 3974.68]  It was a, no, it was a
[3974.68 --> 3974.98]  joke.
[3975.14 --> 3976.00]  You didn't swing it at a
[3976.00 --> 3976.24]  person.
[3976.36 --> 3977.56]  I know it's a joke and me
[3977.56 --> 3978.80]  calling him deranged is a
[3978.80 --> 3979.36]  joke too.
[3979.66 --> 3981.08]  The point is that what's no
[3981.08 --> 3982.12]  joke is their prices.
[3982.26 --> 3983.78]  So if you're spending more
[3983.78 --> 3985.88]  than six dollars or nine
[3985.88 --> 3987.80]  bucks a month for a pretty
[3987.80 --> 3989.02]  darn high-end razor, so
[3989.02 --> 3990.14]  anywhere from four blades
[3990.14 --> 3992.54]  to six blades, then you're
[3992.54 --> 3993.44]  kind of getting screwed
[3993.44 --> 3994.42]  because that includes
[3994.42 --> 3995.68]  shipping and handling to
[3995.68 --> 3997.02]  your door once a month
[3997.02 --> 3997.86]  so that you're never
[3997.86 --> 3999.74]  dragging an old broken
[3999.74 --> 4000.98]  piece of glass or a rusty
[4000.98 --> 4002.20]  nail across your face to
[4002.20 --> 4003.34]  get a nice clean shave
[4003.34 --> 4004.60]  and you don't have to go
[4004.60 --> 4005.54]  to the store and get them
[4005.54 --> 4006.58]  to unlock the cabinet and
[4006.58 --> 4007.32]  buy razors anymore.
[4007.42 --> 4008.28]  So guys, check it out.
[4008.56 --> 4009.38]  Oh, I went to the wrong
[4009.38 --> 4009.64]  thing.
[4010.18 --> 4011.36]  Dollarshaveclub.com slash
[4011.36 --> 4012.76]  Linus ensures that they
[4012.76 --> 4014.24]  will continue to sponsor us
[4014.24 --> 4015.40]  and sponsor the WAN show and
[4015.40 --> 4016.18]  allow us to keep bringing
[4016.18 --> 4017.46]  this great content to you.
[4017.86 --> 4019.04]  Otherwise, you can, of
[4019.04 --> 4020.18]  course, just go and sign up
[4020.18 --> 4022.20]  for it on your own because
[4022.20 --> 4023.42]  screw you, Linus.
[4023.42 --> 4023.92]  Ha ha!
[4024.52 --> 4025.84]  I'm an ad block and I'm a
[4025.84 --> 4027.12]  not use your referral link,
[4027.20 --> 4028.02]  but I like the idea of
[4028.02 --> 4028.94]  Dollar Shave Club and you
[4028.94 --> 4029.24]  know what?
[4029.26 --> 4030.48]  I guess that's fine too.
[4030.90 --> 4031.76]  Also, they have other
[4031.76 --> 4032.90]  supplies like their shave
[4032.90 --> 4033.72]  butter, which goes on
[4033.72 --> 4034.46]  clear so you can see what
[4034.46 --> 4034.98]  you're doing, and their
[4034.98 --> 4036.10]  one-wipe Charlie's, which I
[4036.10 --> 4037.70]  have promised to never
[4037.70 --> 4039.46]  demo live on this show
[4039.46 --> 4041.26]  because they're butt
[4041.26 --> 4041.56]  wipes.
[4043.36 --> 4045.46]  Also sponsoring today is
[4045.46 --> 4046.92]  Lynda.com.
[4047.06 --> 4048.00]  So the great thing about
[4048.00 --> 4050.02]  Lynda.com is actually
[4050.02 --> 4051.90]  just, I mean, who doesn't
[4051.90 --> 4052.78]  like Lynda.com?
[4052.78 --> 4054.02]  You like Lynda.com?
[4054.36 --> 4056.02]  Taryn loves Lynda.com.
[4056.12 --> 4057.12]  You know how, you know
[4057.12 --> 4059.26]  what's funny is I'm usually
[4059.26 --> 4060.28]  the one who does the
[4060.28 --> 4061.90]  sponsor spots around here.
[4062.00 --> 4062.60]  Like, I'm the one who
[4062.60 --> 4064.24]  goes and memorizes or, in
[4064.24 --> 4065.52]  the case of the 5-4 thing
[4065.52 --> 4066.90]  last week, completely
[4066.90 --> 4067.84]  doesn't memorize.
[4067.86 --> 4068.80]  Totally non-memorized.
[4068.82 --> 4069.94]  Totally not memorized.
[4070.28 --> 4072.86]  Like, 100% inaccuracy.
[4073.04 --> 4074.12]  I'm the one who memorizes
[4074.12 --> 4075.10]  the talking points they
[4075.10 --> 4075.62]  want us to hit.
[4075.62 --> 4075.82]  You were very precise.
[4076.12 --> 4076.96]  I'm the one who looks
[4076.96 --> 4078.16]  into, you know, like, sort
[4078.16 --> 4079.36]  of, are these guys legit?
[4079.62 --> 4080.32]  Are they something like
[4080.32 --> 4082.04]  Audible where it's really
[4082.04 --> 4083.32]  easy for us to endorse them
[4083.32 --> 4084.04]  because they've just got a
[4084.04 --> 4084.68]  great service?
[4085.28 --> 4086.72]  And normally I'm the one
[4086.72 --> 4087.50]  who kind of has to do
[4087.50 --> 4088.14]  that stuff.
[4088.36 --> 4089.90]  Whereas with Lynda.com,
[4090.00 --> 4091.12]  Taryn was like, ooh, ooh,
[4091.28 --> 4092.34]  ooh, I want to do the
[4092.34 --> 4093.44]  fastest possibles with the
[4093.44 --> 4094.36]  Lynda.com integrations.
[4094.46 --> 4095.12]  I love them.
[4095.18 --> 4096.04]  I've been using them for
[4096.04 --> 4096.42]  years.
[4096.78 --> 4098.44]  So Lynda.com allows you to
[4098.44 --> 4099.42]  learn all kinds of cool
[4099.42 --> 4099.72]  skills.
[4099.82 --> 4100.66]  You can learn programming
[4100.66 --> 4101.04]  skills.
[4101.22 --> 4102.42]  You could learn Photoshop,
[4102.66 --> 4103.28]  Adobe Premiere.
[4103.28 --> 4104.94]  You could work on your
[4104.94 --> 4105.96]  DSLR skills.
[4105.96 --> 4107.20]  And it's just video
[4107.20 --> 4108.72]  tutorials by industry
[4108.72 --> 4109.94]  experts that allow you to
[4109.94 --> 4111.72]  learn at your own pace and
[4111.72 --> 4113.12]  just study at your computer
[4113.12 --> 4114.36]  and pick up new and
[4114.36 --> 4116.10]  interesting hobbies or even
[4116.10 --> 4117.10]  practical skills that you
[4117.10 --> 4117.80]  can use and work.
[4117.96 --> 4119.28]  So Taryn is a great
[4119.28 --> 4120.28]  example that I love to
[4120.28 --> 4121.82]  bring up because his
[4121.82 --> 4123.82]  Adobe experience has
[4123.82 --> 4125.06]  actually ultimately,
[4125.26 --> 4126.18]  that he started gaining
[4126.18 --> 4127.10]  from Lynda.com, has
[4127.10 --> 4128.80]  ultimately turned into a
[4128.80 --> 4130.34]  full-time job for him.
[4130.46 --> 4132.42]  And in my mind, hopefully,
[4132.54 --> 4133.70]  hopefully a career because I
[4133.70 --> 4134.74]  think he does a great job
[4134.74 --> 4135.50]  of producing YouTube
[4135.50 --> 4136.44]  content and internet
[4136.44 --> 4136.92]  content.
[4137.52 --> 4139.28]  And that's the kind of
[4139.28 --> 4140.14]  power that something like
[4140.14 --> 4141.04]  Lynda.com has.
[4141.28 --> 4142.68]  And what's good about it is
[4142.68 --> 4143.52]  if you go to Lynda.com
[4143.52 --> 4144.98]  slash Wancho, you can get
[4144.98 --> 4146.78]  a free seven-day trial and
[4146.78 --> 4147.26]  check it out.
[4147.54 --> 4148.50]  And speaking of full-time
[4148.50 --> 4149.20]  jobs and stuff, I know
[4149.20 --> 4149.96]  tons of people on the
[4149.96 --> 4150.82]  forum and tons of people in
[4150.82 --> 4151.88]  the community in general are
[4151.88 --> 4152.58]  interested in jobs in
[4152.58 --> 4153.70]  computers, particularly
[4153.70 --> 4154.46]  programming.
[4154.64 --> 4155.16]  If you're thinking about
[4155.16 --> 4155.96]  going into programming and
[4155.96 --> 4157.10]  you're in high school, the
[4157.10 --> 4158.42]  courses you're taking are
[4158.42 --> 4159.82]  probably not hard enough.
[4160.46 --> 4161.36]  Jump on Lynda and start
[4161.36 --> 4161.98]  learning some actual
[4161.98 --> 4162.34]  languages.
[4162.56 --> 4163.34]  It'll help a lot.
[4163.34 --> 4164.86]  You'll have a huge leg up
[4164.86 --> 4165.44]  once you get to
[4165.44 --> 4167.00]  university and you'll be
[4167.00 --> 4168.50]  able to work on stuff in
[4168.50 --> 4169.32]  your own time, which is
[4169.32 --> 4170.06]  more interesting and will
[4170.06 --> 4170.88]  teach you more than your
[4170.88 --> 4171.74]  courses probably will be
[4171.74 --> 4172.46]  teaching you because your
[4172.46 --> 4173.38]  courses are probably out of
[4173.38 --> 4174.84]  date, but Lynda is not
[4174.84 --> 4175.66]  going to be out of date.
[4175.92 --> 4176.62]  So there you go.
[4176.74 --> 4178.04]  Two strong endorsements
[4178.04 --> 4179.66]  around here for Lynda.com
[4179.66 --> 4180.76]  from people who have
[4180.76 --> 4182.18]  legit used it to do things
[4182.18 --> 4183.48]  that they legit have jobs
[4183.48 --> 4184.18]  doing right now.
[4184.38 --> 4184.56]  Yep.
[4184.86 --> 4186.34]  So there you go.
[4186.42 --> 4186.92]  Lynda's kind of
[4186.92 --> 4187.42]  fantastic.
[4187.60 --> 4188.22]  Pretty darn cool.
[4188.22 --> 4188.60]  I highly recommend it.
[4189.42 --> 4189.86]  All right.
[4189.98 --> 4191.18]  And the last thing that I
[4191.18 --> 4192.16]  should probably say, not
[4192.16 --> 4193.30]  related to our sponsors for
[4193.30 --> 4194.70]  this week, but actually 5-4
[4194.70 --> 4196.72]  from last week, they
[4196.72 --> 4197.32]  weren't mad.
[4199.28 --> 4199.72]  Surprisingly.
[4200.46 --> 4201.56]  So for those of you who
[4201.56 --> 4202.80]  weren't watching last week,
[4203.18 --> 4205.30]  5-4 Club clothing, we had a
[4205.30 --> 4207.00]  sponsor thing for them and I
[4207.00 --> 4207.88]  butchered it.
[4208.08 --> 4209.68]  I got the pricing wrong.
[4210.18 --> 4214.16]  I think I got the offer code
[4214.16 --> 4214.52]  wrong.
[4214.90 --> 4216.44]  I got the value of the
[4216.44 --> 4217.44]  clothing that they send you
[4217.44 --> 4217.76]  wrong.
[4217.76 --> 4219.04]  I got the special offer
[4219.04 --> 4219.92]  that day wrong.
[4219.92 --> 4221.70]  Like, I got everything
[4221.70 --> 4222.26]  wrong.
[4222.64 --> 4224.02]  But apparently, apparently
[4224.02 --> 4225.36]  so many of you were like,
[4225.44 --> 4226.32]  oh yeah, this looks kind of
[4226.32 --> 4227.88]  cool and signed up that
[4227.88 --> 4228.88]  they're just like, yeah, no,
[4228.92 --> 4229.50]  it's cool, dude.
[4229.96 --> 4230.66]  It's fine.
[4231.40 --> 4232.90]  At least you said like some
[4232.90 --> 4233.62]  words, I guess.
[4233.74 --> 4233.96]  Cool.
[4234.16 --> 4234.48]  All right.
[4234.76 --> 4235.08]  Yeah.
[4235.30 --> 4236.92]  At least you had like our
[4236.92 --> 4237.94]  logo at the bottom of the
[4237.94 --> 4238.18]  screen.
[4238.18 --> 4238.98]  And you wore a shirt.
[4238.98 --> 4240.50]  We're just spouting nonsense.
[4243.74 --> 4244.14]  Fantastic.
[4244.64 --> 4246.00]  Oh, so, okay.
[4246.12 --> 4247.06]  So let's move on to this
[4247.06 --> 4248.52]  topic that actually hits
[4248.52 --> 4249.94]  pretty close to home for me.
[4250.38 --> 4252.26]  So LG's new wearable is a
[4252.26 --> 4252.80]  child tracker.
[4252.96 --> 4253.06]  Okay.
[4253.14 --> 4255.08]  One, it's butt ugly and they
[4255.08 --> 4256.08]  need to get smaller.
[4256.70 --> 4257.14]  Yeah.
[4257.14 --> 4257.82]  It's absurd.
[4257.92 --> 4258.78]  You can't put that kind of
[4258.78 --> 4259.32]  thing on a child.
[4259.32 --> 4259.60]  Look how big it is on the
[4259.60 --> 4260.30]  girl's wrist mainly.
[4260.38 --> 4260.62]  I know.
[4260.68 --> 4261.22]  This is ridiculous.
[4261.48 --> 4263.70]  These need to be barrettes or
[4263.70 --> 4265.04]  they need to be like, they
[4265.04 --> 4266.04]  need to be something the kid
[4266.04 --> 4267.10]  feels cool wearing.
[4267.10 --> 4268.76]  Um, that's the kind of
[4268.76 --> 4269.72]  thing that they need to be.
[4269.86 --> 4270.90]  They need to be, they need
[4270.90 --> 4272.22]  to have at least a two to
[4272.22 --> 4273.42]  three day battery life.
[4273.62 --> 4274.56]  I mean, we're talking if a
[4274.56 --> 4275.90]  child's missing, but
[4275.90 --> 4276.82]  potentially being moved
[4276.82 --> 4278.06]  around very quickly, or
[4278.06 --> 4278.84]  there's something interfering
[4278.84 --> 4280.04]  with the signal, you need
[4280.04 --> 4281.34]  to have a few days to
[4281.34 --> 4282.90]  potentially get a lock on
[4282.90 --> 4283.08]  it.
[4283.42 --> 4284.30]  Um, so there's, there's,
[4284.38 --> 4285.50]  this technology needs to
[4285.50 --> 4287.08]  advance before it's actually
[4287.08 --> 4288.14]  that useful and before it's
[4288.14 --> 4288.80]  the kind of thing that I
[4288.80 --> 4289.32]  would buy.
[4289.40 --> 4290.58]  But as someone who has
[4290.58 --> 4292.02]  lost a cat, as someone who
[4292.02 --> 4293.66]  has a child and would worry
[4293.66 --> 4294.52]  about losing them.
[4294.72 --> 4295.90]  Has not lost child though.
[4295.90 --> 4297.22]  I have not lost him yet.
[4297.36 --> 4299.92]  Um, I would buy this and I
[4299.92 --> 4300.70]  would put it on my kids.
[4300.82 --> 4301.40]  I see a lot of people
[4301.40 --> 4302.40]  freaking out over this and
[4302.40 --> 4303.84]  this is the kind of thing
[4303.84 --> 4305.54]  that I would go, no, this
[4305.54 --> 4306.74]  is not okay, blah, blah,
[4306.78 --> 4307.40]  blah, normally.
[4308.12 --> 4309.80]  But it's a very obvious
[4309.80 --> 4310.20]  device.
[4310.34 --> 4311.28]  Your kid knows what it's
[4311.28 --> 4312.38]  freaking for and look how
[4312.38 --> 4313.18]  old the kids are.
[4313.26 --> 4314.28]  Okay, but I'm talking about
[4314.28 --> 4315.18]  giving them barrettes and
[4315.18 --> 4315.40]  stuff.
[4315.50 --> 4318.02]  So that's what I would buy.
[4318.24 --> 4318.88]  That's fine.
[4319.22 --> 4320.56]  Um, my main point is look
[4320.56 --> 4321.46]  how old the kids are in
[4321.46 --> 4321.68]  this.
[4321.76 --> 4322.76]  They're not targeting this at
[4322.76 --> 4323.76]  like 17 year olds.
[4324.12 --> 4325.04]  Well, yeah, no, that's
[4325.04 --> 4325.38]  ridiculous.
[4325.38 --> 4326.46]  That's what I'm saying.
[4326.50 --> 4327.10]  A lot of people in the
[4327.10 --> 4327.98]  thing are like, oh, you
[4327.98 --> 4328.68]  shouldn't be able to listen
[4328.68 --> 4329.60]  to your kid's conversation.
[4329.70 --> 4330.54]  I was like, the kid's like
[4330.54 --> 4331.00]  seven.
[4331.10 --> 4332.36]  Yeah, so the way it works is
[4332.36 --> 4333.58]  the kid can press a direct
[4333.58 --> 4334.72]  call button to contact a
[4334.72 --> 4336.60]  pre-configured number and if
[4336.60 --> 4337.72]  the kid doesn't pick up an
[4337.72 --> 4338.86]  incoming call from the
[4338.86 --> 4339.90]  parent's number within 10
[4339.90 --> 4341.22]  seconds, the device just
[4341.22 --> 4342.64]  puts the call through and
[4342.64 --> 4343.70]  then lets the parent listen
[4343.70 --> 4344.72]  to what's going on.
[4344.86 --> 4346.24]  And people who are upset
[4346.24 --> 4347.52]  about that, again, they
[4347.52 --> 4349.08]  don't seem to understand who
[4349.08 --> 4349.82]  this is targeted at.
[4350.20 --> 4352.04]  There's nothing my six-year-old
[4352.04 --> 4354.08]  should be discussing that I
[4354.08 --> 4354.52]  can't hear.
[4355.58 --> 4357.34]  It gets different once we're
[4357.34 --> 4359.06]  talking, you know, 9, 10,
[4359.18 --> 4360.66]  pre-adolescent type age where
[4360.66 --> 4362.82]  they have privacy.
[4363.06 --> 4364.86]  But if they're at the age where
[4364.86 --> 4366.32]  they're still, you're still, you
[4366.32 --> 4367.88]  know, sitting supervising them,
[4368.04 --> 4369.28]  bathing in the tub with all of
[4369.28 --> 4372.04]  their siblings, I mean, they're...
[4372.80 --> 4375.58]  What's, and like, I don't know.
[4375.76 --> 4376.90]  And like the tracking thing,
[4377.02 --> 4377.36]  yeah.
[4377.36 --> 4377.44]  Yeah.
[4378.10 --> 4379.38]  Maybe at a certain age they
[4379.38 --> 4380.40]  need to be able to kind of
[4380.40 --> 4381.12]  just take off.
[4381.98 --> 4382.82]  Not at six.
[4383.56 --> 4383.80]  Yeah.
[4383.96 --> 4384.88]  Not at that age.
[4384.98 --> 4386.02]  They shouldn't be on their
[4386.02 --> 4386.26]  own.
[4386.40 --> 4387.70]  And I mean, this is the kind
[4387.70 --> 4389.84]  of thing that 100% I would
[4389.84 --> 4390.06]  buy.
[4390.52 --> 4391.34]  Someone's like, oh my God,
[4391.36 --> 4392.28]  what if the kid is asleep?
[4392.36 --> 4393.02]  Have you ever heard of a
[4393.02 --> 4393.56]  baby monitor?
[4394.88 --> 4395.88]  It's like so much more
[4395.88 --> 4397.12]  intrusive than a baby monitor.
[4397.22 --> 4397.92]  I mean, so much less
[4397.92 --> 4398.96]  intrusive than a baby monitor.
[4399.08 --> 4399.58]  What are you talking about?
[4399.58 --> 4400.08]  Well, yes and no, because
[4400.08 --> 4400.94]  it's like strapped to the
[4400.94 --> 4401.22]  kid.
[4401.66 --> 4402.68]  Yeah, but the baby monitor
[4402.68 --> 4403.56]  has a camera on it.
[4403.82 --> 4404.24]  Not always.
[4404.52 --> 4405.54]  I have just an audio baby
[4405.54 --> 4406.08]  monitor.
[4406.24 --> 4406.64]  Oh, okay.
[4406.64 --> 4406.90]  Yeah.
[4407.20 --> 4407.36]  Yeah.
[4408.08 --> 4409.10]  Mine's actually awesome.
[4409.18 --> 4409.50]  I don't know.
[4409.64 --> 4410.92]  I don't even want a baby,
[4411.08 --> 4411.94]  so I don't know.
[4413.06 --> 4415.36]  I actually, oh, I forget
[4415.36 --> 4416.02]  what it's called.
[4416.08 --> 4416.84]  I think it's called like
[4416.84 --> 4418.70]  the Mimo or something.
[4419.42 --> 4419.82]  Baby.
[4420.04 --> 4420.36]  I don't know.
[4420.44 --> 4421.74]  I fully understand and
[4421.74 --> 4422.86]  would be agree with and
[4422.86 --> 4423.98]  totally be on the side of
[4423.98 --> 4424.60]  the people that are
[4424.60 --> 4426.14]  freaking out if it was
[4426.14 --> 4427.64]  targeted in a very
[4427.64 --> 4429.62]  stealthy manner at an
[4429.62 --> 4430.70]  older age group.
[4431.44 --> 4431.96]  But it's a very.
[4432.14 --> 4433.68]  That's a totally different.
[4433.70 --> 4434.26]  Totally different
[4434.26 --> 4434.62]  conversation.
[4434.72 --> 4435.64]  That's like very young.
[4435.64 --> 4436.54]  That's like the boyfriend
[4436.54 --> 4437.86]  tracker app that got
[4437.86 --> 4438.56]  pulled off the Google
[4438.56 --> 4439.02]  Play Store.
[4439.20 --> 4439.86]  Totally not okay with
[4439.86 --> 4440.02]  that.
[4440.18 --> 4440.96]  Not okay with boyfriend
[4440.96 --> 4441.26]  tracker.
[4441.38 --> 4442.10]  Not okay with girlfriend
[4442.10 --> 4442.42]  tracker.
[4442.54 --> 4444.76]  Not okay with like my son
[4444.76 --> 4446.18]  is 17 years old tracker.
[4446.62 --> 4447.66]  All that stuff is stupid.
[4448.04 --> 4448.92]  But when it's like a
[4448.92 --> 4450.66]  six-year-old kid or this.
[4451.02 --> 4451.54]  This is cool.
[4451.80 --> 4451.92]  Yeah.
[4451.92 --> 4453.36]  So this is the Mimo.
[4453.50 --> 4454.84]  I actually pre-ordered this
[4454.84 --> 4456.82]  and basically what it is
[4456.82 --> 4458.58]  is their marketing is just
[4458.58 --> 4459.80]  horrendous though.
[4459.98 --> 4460.34]  I'm sorry.
[4460.34 --> 4461.18]  I'm going to interject for a
[4461.18 --> 4461.52]  quick second.
[4461.62 --> 4462.92]  We were talking about text
[4462.92 --> 4463.54]  messages from.
[4463.54 --> 4464.50]  Oh for crying out loud.
[4464.72 --> 4466.62]  $500 prepaid cards to take a
[4466.62 --> 4467.24]  quick survey.
[4467.70 --> 4469.06]  About your call with a
[4469.06 --> 4470.50]  Telus customer service rep.
[4471.04 --> 4471.44]  Unbelievable.
[4471.84 --> 4472.96]  I haven't even had one.
[4473.20 --> 4473.52]  Ugh.
[4473.94 --> 4474.94]  Like this is ridiculous.
[4475.16 --> 4476.06]  I haven't had a call with
[4476.06 --> 4476.64]  them in forever.
[4477.44 --> 4478.96]  Telus my ISP just randomly
[4478.96 --> 4479.96]  sent me a text message.
[4480.02 --> 4480.54]  We were talking about how
[4480.54 --> 4481.18]  that's bullcrap.
[4481.46 --> 4482.12]  I've been saying about how
[4482.12 --> 4483.42]  I get them all the time now.
[4483.46 --> 4485.40]  His ISP and his phone
[4485.40 --> 4485.64]  provider.
[4485.64 --> 4485.90]  Yes.
[4486.02 --> 4486.24]  Sorry.
[4486.46 --> 4486.60]  Yeah.
[4486.68 --> 4486.88]  Both.
[4486.88 --> 4489.10]  Anyway so you are a great
[4489.10 --> 4490.12]  parent for buying our product.
[4490.24 --> 4491.04]  I hate this kind of crap.
[4491.34 --> 4493.14]  But it is actually really
[4493.14 --> 4493.40]  cool.
[4493.50 --> 4494.70]  So it lets you monitor their
[4494.70 --> 4496.12]  breathing, temperature,
[4496.76 --> 4497.68]  stuff like that.
[4497.72 --> 4499.38]  And it's just a onesie that
[4499.38 --> 4499.64]  they wear.
[4499.80 --> 4501.90]  Yeah we saw this at CES right?
[4502.10 --> 4503.46]  And it had what was it?
[4503.64 --> 4504.42]  Galileo or something?
[4504.86 --> 4505.70]  I don't remember.
[4505.76 --> 4506.54]  It was one of the Intel
[4506.54 --> 4507.70]  little microchips in it which
[4507.70 --> 4508.14]  is pretty cool.
[4508.16 --> 4510.42]  So I plan to do like a
[4510.42 --> 4511.36]  review of it or something
[4511.36 --> 4512.46]  when the new baby lands.
[4512.60 --> 4512.96]  That's cool.
[4512.96 --> 4514.02]  I should follow up on my
[4514.02 --> 4514.88]  order because the baby's
[4514.88 --> 4515.92]  coming soon and I remember
[4515.92 --> 4516.86]  doing the math and it was
[4516.88 --> 4517.94]  supposed to arrive in time.
[4518.24 --> 4519.06]  I love when you check your
[4519.06 --> 4519.98]  smartwatch because you do it
[4519.98 --> 4520.50]  so officially.
[4522.06 --> 4523.76]  Oh well the issue is that
[4523.76 --> 4525.42]  okay here this is my one
[4525.42 --> 4526.24]  complaint about the pebble
[4526.24 --> 4528.40]  steel is that it tends to
[4528.40 --> 4530.50]  sit here on my wrist with
[4530.50 --> 4532.68]  this buckle in the middle and
[4532.68 --> 4534.06]  it like not in the middle off
[4534.06 --> 4535.20]  to the side even though I've
[4535.20 --> 4536.26]  shortened this side as much
[4536.26 --> 4537.20]  as I possibly can.
[4537.56 --> 4539.18]  So I often have to kind of
[4539.18 --> 4540.46]  give it a shake.
[4540.80 --> 4542.42]  So the whip does two things
[4542.42 --> 4543.52]  because that illuminates the
[4543.52 --> 4545.04]  backlight on the pebble and
[4545.04 --> 4545.72]  it puts it in a better
[4545.72 --> 4546.52]  position for me to read it.
[4546.52 --> 4546.96]  That makes sense.
[4547.18 --> 4548.16]  It just looks so official
[4548.16 --> 4548.58]  every time.
[4548.62 --> 4549.68]  And the reason I look at my
[4549.68 --> 4551.58]  watch so often is because I
[4551.58 --> 4552.46]  don't just want to know what
[4552.46 --> 4553.02]  time it is.
[4553.20 --> 4554.68]  I also check to find out what
[4554.68 --> 4556.44]  the date and month is because
[4556.44 --> 4557.74]  I often forget these things.
[4558.54 --> 4559.44]  We're having a conversation
[4559.44 --> 4559.82]  that day.
[4559.92 --> 4560.90]  When you work so much
[4560.90 --> 4562.52]  sometimes you just focus too
[4562.52 --> 4563.40]  much on the thing at hand and
[4563.40 --> 4564.66]  you have no short-term memory
[4564.66 --> 4564.98]  anymore.
[4565.42 --> 4566.68]  What was that video I just
[4566.68 --> 4566.92]  filmed?
[4567.04 --> 4567.80]  I'm not sure.
[4568.08 --> 4570.74]  Oh one of the NCIX higher
[4570.74 --> 4572.54]  ups came into the studio today
[4572.54 --> 4574.16]  when we were filming and he was
[4574.16 --> 4575.56]  like Linus what do you think of
[4575.56 --> 4576.96]  the Lenovo X1 Carbon?
[4577.32 --> 4578.64]  And I'm like I don't know.
[4579.32 --> 4579.80]  What is it?
[4579.86 --> 4581.42]  And he's like well you did a
[4581.42 --> 4581.96]  video of it.
[4582.16 --> 4582.84]  I'm like really?
[4585.34 --> 4585.94]  Did I?
[4586.32 --> 4586.64]  Oh.
[4586.92 --> 4588.44]  If you see the video then you'll
[4588.44 --> 4589.20]  remember and you'll be able to
[4589.20 --> 4589.68]  talk about it.
[4589.80 --> 4590.04]  But like.
[4590.10 --> 4590.50]  Probably not.
[4590.76 --> 4590.96]  No?
[4591.12 --> 4591.28]  No.
[4591.38 --> 4591.58]  No.
[4591.72 --> 4593.12]  I don't remember a thing about it.
[4593.22 --> 4594.06]  I have to get triggers.
[4594.60 --> 4595.42]  I won't remember but if
[4595.42 --> 4596.90]  someone's like look you did the
[4596.90 --> 4597.96]  video I'll be like oh yeah
[4597.96 --> 4599.18]  here's a bunch of extra stuff I
[4599.18 --> 4599.56]  can say.
[4599.56 --> 4600.92]  But yeah I don't know.
[4601.12 --> 4604.12]  Alright so let's play Hot or
[4604.12 --> 4604.64]  Not.
[4605.34 --> 4608.00]  And I am I'm putting a bit of a
[4608.00 --> 4609.00]  different spin on it than you
[4609.00 --> 4610.00]  might be expecting.
[4611.28 --> 4612.38]  So hold on a second.
[4612.52 --> 4613.64]  What's that site called?
[4613.82 --> 4614.66]  Speaking of no memory.
[4614.78 --> 4615.10]  Strawpool.
[4615.12 --> 4615.32]  Strawpool.
[4615.34 --> 4615.80]  There we go.
[4616.48 --> 4618.06]  Hot or not.
[4618.24 --> 4619.22]  And we are going to have three
[4619.22 --> 4619.88]  options.
[4620.56 --> 4620.96]  Hot.
[4621.48 --> 4622.00]  Not.
[4623.12 --> 4623.60]  Slick.
[4624.46 --> 4624.90]  Okay.
[4624.90 --> 4625.04]  Okay.
[4627.28 --> 4628.28]  So here we go.
[4628.28 --> 4629.94]  But you guys have to look at it
[4629.94 --> 4630.52]  first.
[4631.06 --> 4632.52]  Don't vote yet.
[4633.88 --> 4635.06]  Because everyone's just going to
[4635.06 --> 4635.78]  vote for you.
[4636.04 --> 4637.38]  And I do legitimately want an
[4637.38 --> 4637.90]  answer here.
[4638.24 --> 4638.60]  Yes.
[4638.86 --> 4639.04]  Vote for me.
[4639.04 --> 4641.54]  The new Inwin S frame.
[4641.92 --> 4643.38]  So it's a limited edition for
[4643.38 --> 4643.58]  sale.
[4643.70 --> 4644.28]  Mind you.
[4644.64 --> 4646.50]  They said that stupid pipe one
[4646.50 --> 4647.44]  was limited edition.
[4647.58 --> 4648.64]  First it was limited edition.
[4648.94 --> 4651.40]  Then it's like limited edition of
[4651.40 --> 4652.44]  each color and we're going to do a
[4652.44 --> 4652.96]  bunch of colors.
[4653.34 --> 4654.34]  And then now they just kind of
[4654.34 --> 4655.18]  still seem to be around.
[4655.28 --> 4656.18]  Anyway I don't know how limited
[4656.18 --> 4656.98]  any of this stuff is.
[4656.98 --> 4658.84]  But limited edition up for sale.
[4659.24 --> 4661.06]  Basically this is a new case
[4661.06 --> 4662.74]  construction concept that has a
[4662.74 --> 4664.96]  single piece of aluminum folded
[4664.96 --> 4666.90]  over and over again.
[4667.02 --> 4667.44]  So bent,
[4667.60 --> 4667.82]  bent,
[4667.94 --> 4668.12]  bent,
[4668.22 --> 4668.36]  bent.
[4668.42 --> 4670.04]  Something that I personally have an
[4670.04 --> 4671.04]  appreciation for.
[4671.52 --> 4672.48]  So my TJ07.
[4672.92 --> 4674.62]  I love that it's a single unibody
[4674.62 --> 4676.08]  piece of aluminum for the top,
[4676.36 --> 4676.56]  front,
[4676.72 --> 4677.32]  and bottom.
[4678.16 --> 4679.82]  Although this one is a little
[4679.82 --> 4680.86]  out there looking for me.
[4680.94 --> 4682.48]  I prefer a more classical style
[4682.48 --> 4682.88]  design.
[4683.26 --> 4684.58]  So basically they fold it,
[4684.66 --> 4684.94]  fold it,
[4685.00 --> 4685.28]  fold it,
[4685.28 --> 4686.58]  and then add two slices of
[4686.58 --> 4687.30]  tempered glass.
[4687.42 --> 4688.30]  I love that.
[4688.86 --> 4691.34]  Glass needs to be a more
[4691.34 --> 4693.60]  prominent design material,
[4693.96 --> 4695.14]  or like a more frequently used
[4695.14 --> 4697.42]  design material for computer cases
[4697.42 --> 4699.06]  versus acrylic because acrylic is
[4699.06 --> 4699.44]  poopy.
[4699.82 --> 4701.02]  And then there are carbon fiber
[4701.02 --> 4702.16]  areas for cable routing.
[4702.26 --> 4703.38]  This is a good view of it right
[4703.38 --> 4703.64]  here.
[4703.64 --> 4706.18]  So you can see how this piece is
[4706.18 --> 4706.54]  folded,
[4706.82 --> 4707.08]  folded,
[4707.34 --> 4707.60]  folded,
[4707.78 --> 4708.00]  folded,
[4708.14 --> 4708.32]  folded.
[4708.42 --> 4709.54]  The motherboard tray mounts right
[4709.54 --> 4709.86]  here.
[4710.08 --> 4711.66]  And then there's also a demo build
[4711.66 --> 4713.80]  here that was on display that you
[4713.80 --> 4715.62]  guys can check out with liquid
[4715.62 --> 4716.00]  cooling.
[4716.42 --> 4717.92]  So here's what I want to know,
[4718.06 --> 4718.40]  Twitch,
[4718.84 --> 4720.76]  hot or not?
[4720.90 --> 4721.76]  Here is the link,
[4721.90 --> 4723.28]  the official straw poll link.
[4723.72 --> 4725.42]  I'm just going to paste these a few
[4725.42 --> 4727.12]  times here so you guys can get your
[4727.12 --> 4727.74]  votes in.
[4727.74 --> 4730.86]  So what do you think?
[4732.92 --> 4734.12]  I'm watching votes come in.
[4735.02 --> 4736.42]  What do I think about the case?
[4736.66 --> 4738.10]  You're just watching your ego come
[4738.10 --> 4738.88]  in is what you're watching.
[4738.90 --> 4739.32]  Pretty much,
[4739.48 --> 4739.78]  actually.
[4740.38 --> 4741.64]  So what do I think about the case?
[4741.68 --> 4742.18]  Is that your question?
[4742.42 --> 4742.64]  Yeah.
[4743.42 --> 4744.04]  Hot or not?
[4744.72 --> 4746.04]  I think it's very cool that it's a
[4746.04 --> 4746.70]  solid piece of aluminum.
[4746.96 --> 4747.40]  I think it's very cool.
[4747.40 --> 4747.46]  So wait,
[4747.50 --> 4747.76]  hold on,
[4747.80 --> 4748.04]  hold on,
[4748.06 --> 4748.32]  hold on.
[4749.46 --> 4752.10]  So cool would be not then.
[4755.46 --> 4756.26]  I think it's very hot.
[4756.26 --> 4757.26]  Something that's cool is by
[4757.26 --> 4757.62]  definition,
[4757.74 --> 4758.08]  not hot.
[4758.12 --> 4760.24]  I think it's very hot that it has
[4760.24 --> 4761.22]  a solid piece of aluminum.
[4761.62 --> 4761.90]  Okay.
[4761.96 --> 4762.16]  Okay.
[4762.16 --> 4762.58]  It's going to get awkward.
[4762.60 --> 4762.76]  Sorry,
[4762.82 --> 4762.94]  sorry.
[4763.46 --> 4764.60]  I think it's very cool it has a
[4764.60 --> 4765.16]  solid piece of aluminum.
[4765.32 --> 4766.24]  I really appreciate that they
[4766.24 --> 4767.28]  actually use glass.
[4768.86 --> 4770.42]  What I don't like is that it's,
[4770.68 --> 4771.92]  if you take the one piece of
[4771.92 --> 4772.40]  glass off,
[4772.44 --> 4773.66]  it's like a glorified test bench
[4773.66 --> 4775.08]  because of how open air it is.
[4775.26 --> 4775.54]  Right.
[4775.96 --> 4777.00]  So it's a bit of a dust.
[4777.00 --> 4779.18]  The guy that posted the thread
[4779.18 --> 4781.14]  brought up the idea that like,
[4781.22 --> 4782.42]  you can't look at this like a
[4782.42 --> 4783.28]  performance box.
[4783.66 --> 4783.78]  Right.
[4783.90 --> 4784.74]  Look at it like an art
[4784.74 --> 4785.26]  installation.
[4785.80 --> 4786.02]  I don't,
[4786.14 --> 4787.06]  that's not his exact words,
[4787.06 --> 4787.98]  but that's essentially what he
[4787.98 --> 4788.28]  was saying.
[4789.02 --> 4790.70]  And that's an interesting idea,
[4790.98 --> 4792.80]  but the thing is just going to,
[4792.88 --> 4793.04]  like,
[4793.08 --> 4793.86]  it's not going to be an art
[4793.86 --> 4794.96]  installation for that long
[4794.96 --> 4795.80]  because it's just going to be a
[4795.80 --> 4796.04]  dust.
[4796.10 --> 4797.00]  And if I was going to have
[4797.00 --> 4798.38]  something really that I thought
[4798.38 --> 4799.42]  was beautiful and,
[4799.42 --> 4799.70]  and,
[4799.70 --> 4800.74]  and artsy,
[4800.80 --> 4802.16]  I would probably go for a desk
[4802.16 --> 4802.60]  computer.
[4802.60 --> 4805.28]  I'd go for a nice tempered glass top
[4805.28 --> 4808.24]  desk computer with filtered intakes.
[4808.56 --> 4811.02]  And it's pretty aggressive to be a
[4811.02 --> 4812.06]  fancy artsy.
[4813.18 --> 4813.84]  Do you know what I mean?
[4813.90 --> 4815.08]  And then my other issue is that
[4815.08 --> 4816.12]  there's nothing that really matches
[4816.12 --> 4816.38]  it.
[4816.82 --> 4817.12]  Yeah.
[4817.28 --> 4818.82]  So the tower looks like what it
[4818.82 --> 4819.42]  looks like.
[4819.42 --> 4820.40]  And then the only way to have
[4820.40 --> 4821.92]  something kind of similar looking,
[4822.08 --> 4822.36]  I mean,
[4822.36 --> 4824.50]  I guess you could go Corsair
[4824.50 --> 4826.56]  mechanical keyboard,
[4827.16 --> 4828.04]  the black and yeah,
[4828.06 --> 4829.48]  with a black aluminum backing,
[4829.66 --> 4830.42]  you could go,
[4830.58 --> 4830.78]  uh,
[4830.78 --> 4831.32]  you could go,
[4831.42 --> 4831.80]  I don't know,
[4831.92 --> 4833.58]  thermal take BMW mouse.
[4834.48 --> 4834.92]  Um,
[4835.22 --> 4836.64]  it's totally uncomfortable and way
[4836.64 --> 4837.06]  too heavy,
[4837.06 --> 4838.12]  but like if you wanted something
[4838.12 --> 4839.10]  that looked kind of edgy,
[4839.10 --> 4839.76]  this is very,
[4840.26 --> 4840.54]  the,
[4840.58 --> 4842.46]  the BMW must have circles cut into
[4842.46 --> 4842.60]  it.
[4842.68 --> 4843.12]  That's true.
[4843.20 --> 4844.32]  This is very straight lines.
[4844.48 --> 4844.72]  Edgy.
[4844.80 --> 4845.56]  Almost again,
[4845.60 --> 4847.14]  actually the Corsair mouse.
[4847.28 --> 4847.50]  Yeah.
[4847.50 --> 4849.56]  You could go with like an M 65 or
[4849.56 --> 4849.82]  whatever,
[4850.00 --> 4850.78]  which is a laser mouse.
[4850.78 --> 4853.04]  Unfortunately I'm more cut.
[4853.16 --> 4855.04]  I'm pushing them to do an optical
[4855.04 --> 4856.58]  like RGB mouse.
[4856.68 --> 4857.68]  That's what I'd like to see.
[4857.78 --> 4860.40]  Like a lower end sensor,
[4860.76 --> 4861.54]  optical sensor,
[4861.54 --> 4864.00]  but with high end features like
[4864.00 --> 4865.18]  RGB and all that kind of crap.
[4865.50 --> 4865.88]  All right.
[4865.88 --> 4868.02]  So most of you are saying,
[4868.14 --> 4868.40]  uh,
[4868.40 --> 4869.64]  although it's actually very close
[4869.64 --> 4870.92]  between slick and hot.
[4870.96 --> 4872.06]  So most of you,
[4872.10 --> 4873.64]  which obviously means that those
[4873.64 --> 4874.12]  go together.
[4874.40 --> 4874.70]  Yeah.
[4874.80 --> 4875.24]  No,
[4875.24 --> 4876.04]  not no.
[4876.12 --> 4877.36]  It means that those are bitter
[4877.36 --> 4879.38]  enemies because they're competing
[4879.38 --> 4880.36]  against each other.
[4880.36 --> 4880.58]  No,
[4880.58 --> 4880.74]  see,
[4880.80 --> 4882.48]  we're grouping up in one and two.
[4882.62 --> 4883.64]  We're beating up on not.
[4884.50 --> 4886.78]  That's really not how voting works,
[4887.30 --> 4887.78]  actually.
[4888.64 --> 4888.84]  Um,
[4888.84 --> 4889.32]  so anyway,
[4889.72 --> 4890.04]  um,
[4890.08 --> 4890.62]  so most,
[4890.70 --> 4891.84]  most of you are,
[4891.92 --> 4892.02]  no.
[4892.42 --> 4892.70]  Uh,
[4892.70 --> 4894.26]  so most of you are saying slick
[4894.26 --> 4896.12]  with the rest of you saying
[4896.12 --> 4896.94]  either hot or not.
[4896.96 --> 4897.20]  And about,
[4897.28 --> 4898.38]  it's about a two to one ratio
[4898.38 --> 4900.44]  between hot and not for the
[4900.44 --> 4901.16]  in win case.
[4901.16 --> 4902.58]  One thing that's going to be a
[4902.58 --> 4903.72]  problem is it's going to be
[4903.72 --> 4904.04]  expensive.
[4904.16 --> 4904.40]  Yeah,
[4904.46 --> 4905.12]  it's going to be extremely
[4905.12 --> 4905.36]  expensive.
[4905.38 --> 4905.88]  It's going to be really
[4905.88 --> 4906.16]  expensive.
[4906.34 --> 4906.46]  The,
[4906.46 --> 4907.64]  the site that's estimated how
[4907.64 --> 4908.76]  expensive it's going to be is
[4908.76 --> 4910.54]  known for being totally not
[4910.54 --> 4910.84]  right,
[4911.26 --> 4912.18]  but it's still going to be really
[4912.18 --> 4912.52]  expensive.
[4913.30 --> 4913.78]  All right.
[4913.82 --> 4915.44]  So we've got a few more rapid
[4915.44 --> 4916.58]  fire topics here.
[4916.58 --> 4918.34]  So there's a police dog that was
[4918.34 --> 4919.98]  trained to sniff out hard drives
[4919.98 --> 4921.24]  and memory cards.
[4921.38 --> 4922.62]  This was originally posted by
[4922.62 --> 4924.04]  Johnners on the forum and it's a
[4924.04 --> 4924.62]  Hexas article.
[4924.62 --> 4925.58]  I got kind of a kick out of
[4925.58 --> 4925.84]  this.
[4926.26 --> 4927.68]  So this is Thoreau.
[4929.50 --> 4929.94]  And,
[4930.04 --> 4930.30]  uh,
[4930.30 --> 4932.38]  the idea is to find technological
[4932.38 --> 4932.82]  jag,
[4932.92 --> 4933.16]  jag,
[4933.22 --> 4933.48]  jag,
[4933.48 --> 4933.72]  jaggits,
[4934.28 --> 4936.40]  gadgets that could contain child
[4936.40 --> 4936.94]  pornography.
[4937.26 --> 4938.52]  So they want to find,
[4938.52 --> 4938.82]  uh,
[4938.82 --> 4939.98]  child porn traffickers.
[4940.14 --> 4941.32]  Is there a specific smell to
[4941.32 --> 4942.26]  child pornography?
[4942.42 --> 4942.58]  No,
[4942.64 --> 4943.70]  but there's a specific smell
[4943.70 --> 4945.14]  apparently to these electronics.
[4945.14 --> 4946.86]  And I think that's pretty darn
[4946.86 --> 4947.24]  cool.
[4947.54 --> 4948.12]  You know,
[4948.18 --> 4949.88]  dogs continue to be amazing.
[4950.04 --> 4951.40]  Although I'm not stoked for like
[4951.40 --> 4953.80]  every single piece of electronics
[4953.80 --> 4955.78]  I have being individually searched
[4955.78 --> 4956.96]  through every single file when I
[4956.96 --> 4957.54]  go through the airport.
[4958.50 --> 4958.78]  Well,
[4959.02 --> 4959.42]  okay.
[4959.62 --> 4959.92]  Yeah.
[4960.58 --> 4962.04]  Desktop sales are apparently no
[4962.04 --> 4962.88]  longer in decline.
[4963.00 --> 4964.12]  This was bound to happen eventually
[4964.12 --> 4966.26]  because the desktop is not dead.
[4967.08 --> 4968.54]  And it's just not most keyboard
[4968.54 --> 4971.38]  monitor usage experience is not
[4971.38 --> 4971.82]  dead.
[4971.90 --> 4972.26]  It's just,
[4972.34 --> 4973.50]  they're not getting as fast anymore.
[4973.62 --> 4975.16]  And what he just said,
[4975.48 --> 4977.54]  they are so much more reliable now
[4977.54 --> 4978.26]  than they used to be.
[4978.34 --> 4978.54]  I mean,
[4979.10 --> 4980.42]  it used to be,
[4980.54 --> 4982.48]  you didn't even get solid state caps
[4982.48 --> 4983.74]  on a server grade motherboard.
[4984.00 --> 4984.10]  Yeah.
[4984.12 --> 4984.76]  You were still getting
[4984.76 --> 4985.56]  electrolytic caps.
[4985.58 --> 4986.84]  And look at how many successful
[4986.84 --> 4987.98]  first boots you have now
[4987.98 --> 4988.64]  compared to before.
[4988.92 --> 4989.56]  The huge,
[4989.66 --> 4991.26]  very important rule used to be
[4991.26 --> 4992.30]  make sure that you
[4992.30 --> 4993.70]  don't put the side panel
[4993.70 --> 4994.16]  on your computer.
[4994.26 --> 4996.20]  Bad luck to screw in the side panel
[4996.20 --> 4997.10]  the first time you put it
[4997.10 --> 4997.56]  on your PC.
[4997.82 --> 4998.62]  And now it like just doesn't matter.
[4998.70 --> 4999.66]  Everything just doesn't work.
[4999.66 --> 4999.76]  Because it'll work.
[5000.24 --> 5000.52]  Yeah.
[5000.98 --> 5001.46]  So anyway,
[5001.46 --> 5003.22]  they are no longer declining
[5003.22 --> 5004.40]  according to Gartner.
[5004.60 --> 5005.80]  And I believe there was
[5005.80 --> 5007.40]  one other analyst firm
[5007.40 --> 5008.56]  that was saying that
[5008.56 --> 5010.02]  they aren't declining.
[5010.18 --> 5011.40]  Although they didn't quite agree
[5011.40 --> 5013.62]  on exactly how much
[5013.62 --> 5013.96]  and all this stuff.
[5013.96 --> 5015.02]  How much it's not declining.
[5015.10 --> 5015.82]  But it's like a very,
[5015.90 --> 5016.06]  very,
[5016.14 --> 5016.36]  very,
[5016.36 --> 5016.72]  very,
[5016.72 --> 5017.96]  very minor decline.
[5018.12 --> 5018.30]  Yeah.
[5018.54 --> 5018.82]  I mean,
[5018.90 --> 5021.20]  I hope that this is good news
[5021.20 --> 5023.18]  for the PC industry in general.
[5023.32 --> 5025.04]  Not just for the desktop PC
[5025.04 --> 5025.74]  because I don't think
[5025.74 --> 5026.58]  it was going anywhere.
[5026.58 --> 5027.18]  I never thought
[5027.18 --> 5028.12]  it was going anywhere anyway.
[5028.54 --> 5030.08]  But I hope this is good news
[5030.08 --> 5030.80]  for the health
[5030.80 --> 5031.80]  of the PC industry.
[5032.34 --> 5032.50]  Now,
[5032.66 --> 5033.96]  once things have leveled out
[5033.96 --> 5035.12]  and it's not this
[5035.12 --> 5036.52]  market share grab
[5036.52 --> 5037.36]  and race to zero,
[5037.60 --> 5038.82]  I hope we see
[5038.82 --> 5040.22]  more expensive products.
[5040.32 --> 5041.02]  And hold on a second.
[5041.44 --> 5042.96]  I'm not asking for gouging,
[5043.04 --> 5043.90]  but what I'm asking for
[5043.90 --> 5044.62]  is higher quality.
[5044.96 --> 5045.84]  Premier products.
[5045.98 --> 5046.12]  Yes.
[5046.24 --> 5048.66]  I'm asking for companies
[5048.66 --> 5050.02]  to see the opportunity
[5050.02 --> 5051.50]  that someone like Apple
[5051.50 --> 5052.06]  has seen
[5052.06 --> 5053.92]  to deliver premium products
[5053.92 --> 5055.08]  that are just
[5055.08 --> 5056.20]  legitimately better
[5056.20 --> 5056.86]  than the other ones
[5056.86 --> 5057.38]  that are out there.
[5057.44 --> 5058.42]  I think the Blade 14
[5058.42 --> 5059.70]  is a fantastic example
[5059.70 --> 5060.22]  of this.
[5061.68 --> 5062.12]  Funny,
[5062.26 --> 5062.58]  funny thing.
[5062.58 --> 5063.46]  As much as I appreciate
[5063.46 --> 5064.98]  you guys posting
[5064.98 --> 5066.18]  all over Razor's
[5066.18 --> 5067.56]  Twitter and Facebook
[5067.56 --> 5068.16]  and everything,
[5068.52 --> 5069.50]  I don't legitimately
[5069.50 --> 5070.28]  need Razor
[5070.28 --> 5071.28]  to give me a Blade 14.
[5071.40 --> 5071.88]  It's fine.
[5071.98 --> 5073.34]  I would love to have one,
[5073.76 --> 5075.02]  but Razor's policy
[5075.02 --> 5075.74]  with systems
[5075.74 --> 5077.04]  is that they don't
[5077.04 --> 5078.28]  give out review units
[5078.28 --> 5079.38]  and that's fine.
[5080.24 --> 5081.68]  So it is what it is
[5081.68 --> 5083.56]  and I don't need it
[5083.56 --> 5084.14]  that badly.
[5084.38 --> 5085.06]  If I did,
[5085.66 --> 5086.64]  I could probably
[5086.64 --> 5087.70]  save my pennies.
[5087.88 --> 5089.18]  It would be for quite a while
[5089.18 --> 5090.44]  and I could probably
[5090.44 --> 5091.04]  buy one,
[5091.12 --> 5091.72]  but it's just
[5091.72 --> 5093.10]  outside of my price range
[5093.10 --> 5094.16]  and that's okay.
[5094.44 --> 5095.62]  I have an excellent laptop
[5095.62 --> 5096.74]  that I'm very happy with
[5096.74 --> 5097.32]  and I'll continue
[5097.32 --> 5098.14]  to use this
[5098.14 --> 5099.54]  until it dies,
[5099.76 --> 5100.96]  which it might be dying.
[5101.10 --> 5102.02]  Since the water incident,
[5102.14 --> 5102.58]  I've been getting
[5102.58 --> 5103.38]  some blue screens,
[5103.60 --> 5104.72]  so...
[5104.72 --> 5107.66]  It works for now,
[5107.76 --> 5108.00]  though,
[5108.12 --> 5109.14]  and something can sit
[5109.14 --> 5109.64]  blue screening
[5109.64 --> 5110.54]  for a long time
[5110.54 --> 5111.02]  before it actually
[5111.02 --> 5111.60]  decides to die.
[5111.70 --> 5111.96]  Well, yeah,
[5112.00 --> 5113.30]  but I don't like losing work
[5113.30 --> 5114.98]  because I do a lot of work
[5114.98 --> 5115.64]  on this laptop.
[5116.02 --> 5116.60]  You have auto-saving
[5116.60 --> 5117.16]  through Word?
[5117.38 --> 5118.06]  That shouldn't be that big.
[5118.06 --> 5118.42]  Yeah,
[5118.64 --> 5119.68]  but it's a pain in the butt
[5119.68 --> 5120.26]  because, like,
[5120.28 --> 5121.00]  you know how I manage
[5121.00 --> 5121.92]  my browser tabs
[5121.92 --> 5122.68]  and sometimes it doesn't
[5122.68 --> 5123.48]  remember my session
[5123.48 --> 5124.32]  and so...
[5124.32 --> 5125.34]  You know what's super annoying?
[5125.66 --> 5126.70]  Sorry to interject here,
[5126.78 --> 5127.74]  but in terms of
[5127.74 --> 5128.52]  remembering session,
[5129.00 --> 5131.32]  when you close your browser
[5131.32 --> 5132.12]  and, like,
[5132.36 --> 5133.20]  something updates
[5133.20 --> 5135.08]  and forces a browser open,
[5135.54 --> 5136.26]  like Flash,
[5136.32 --> 5136.68]  it'll be like,
[5136.74 --> 5137.64]  thank you for installing,
[5137.80 --> 5138.02]  whatever,
[5138.42 --> 5140.40]  and then your restore session
[5140.40 --> 5142.00]  is now that freaking page?
[5142.08 --> 5142.32]  Yeah.
[5142.32 --> 5144.20]  Oh my god.
[5144.80 --> 5145.84]  Screw off.
[5146.16 --> 5147.32]  I've lost so many
[5147.32 --> 5148.60]  important things that way.
[5148.98 --> 5149.38]  I'm just like,
[5149.48 --> 5149.88]  damn it,
[5149.88 --> 5150.62]  I can't go into history
[5150.62 --> 5151.50]  for this because I opened it,
[5151.64 --> 5151.68]  like,
[5151.84 --> 5152.62]  four days ago.
[5153.38 --> 5154.36]  Oh my god.
[5155.16 --> 5155.46]  Yeah.
[5155.62 --> 5156.62]  You only keep a couple days
[5156.62 --> 5157.02]  of history?
[5158.30 --> 5159.12]  No, it's just, like,
[5159.12 --> 5159.84]  I don't remember exactly
[5159.84 --> 5160.24]  what it's called.
[5160.88 --> 5161.60]  Like, I don't remember
[5161.60 --> 5162.68]  exactly what was important.
[5162.90 --> 5163.24]  I just remember
[5163.24 --> 5164.28]  there was important things
[5164.28 --> 5165.44]  and going through
[5165.44 --> 5166.42]  all that history
[5166.42 --> 5167.02]  would be ridiculous.
[5167.50 --> 5168.40]  Alright, we've got a couple
[5168.40 --> 5169.80]  more rapid-fire topics here.
[5169.80 --> 5171.26]  So Uber Hamburger
[5171.26 --> 5172.82]  has posted this
[5172.82 --> 5174.80]  VR room technology
[5174.80 --> 5175.48]  that you guys should
[5175.48 --> 5176.44]  probably check out
[5176.44 --> 5177.08]  the video for.
[5177.16 --> 5178.14]  It's pretty friggin' cool.
[5178.38 --> 5178.96]  This is definitely
[5178.96 --> 5179.66]  one of those things
[5179.66 --> 5180.16]  where it's like,
[5180.24 --> 5181.60]  yeah, version much higher
[5181.60 --> 5182.12]  than this.
[5182.22 --> 5182.56]  Yeah.
[5183.32 --> 5184.30]  Needs to be a thing.
[5184.42 --> 5184.62]  Yeah.
[5184.78 --> 5186.02]  But they've got a great preview
[5186.02 --> 5187.00]  here at the very beginning
[5187.00 --> 5188.46]  where the guy's walking
[5188.46 --> 5189.20]  around in a room,
[5189.28 --> 5190.46]  like a projected room,
[5190.84 --> 5192.02]  so you can see the flickering
[5192.02 --> 5193.06]  that the camera's picking up.
[5193.12 --> 5193.96]  But it's 3D,
[5194.08 --> 5195.06]  so he's wearing 3D glasses
[5195.06 --> 5196.76]  and then he's got tracking points
[5196.76 --> 5198.18]  on this device he's holding
[5198.18 --> 5199.06]  as well as the glasses
[5199.06 --> 5200.56]  that allow him
[5200.56 --> 5201.64]  to walk around
[5201.64 --> 5202.66]  the virtual room
[5202.66 --> 5203.14]  and like,
[5203.50 --> 5204.64]  look under things
[5204.64 --> 5206.44]  and walk around things,
[5206.48 --> 5207.06]  sort of.
[5207.14 --> 5207.42]  I mean,
[5207.84 --> 5208.90]  if you walk into the
[5208.90 --> 5210.58]  wall with the projection
[5210.58 --> 5211.68]  on it,
[5211.76 --> 5212.62]  then that's a problem.
[5212.62 --> 5213.18]  But then you can,
[5213.42 --> 5214.26]  yeah, he's seeing
[5214.26 --> 5215.20]  through the glasses,
[5215.38 --> 5216.14]  so he can actually see
[5216.14 --> 5216.80]  if he's going to walk
[5216.80 --> 5217.56]  into the wall or not.
[5217.56 --> 5220.24]  He's saying that it's so immersive
[5220.24 --> 5222.60]  that they've actually had problems
[5222.60 --> 5224.46]  with people coming into the room,
[5225.06 --> 5225.90]  walking around in it
[5225.90 --> 5226.66]  for a few minutes
[5226.66 --> 5228.02]  and then not being able
[5228.02 --> 5228.62]  to figure out
[5228.62 --> 5229.38]  where the exit is.
[5230.20 --> 5232.02]  So their system for this
[5232.02 --> 5233.16]  is that when you touch
[5233.16 --> 5234.24]  each of the walls,
[5234.66 --> 5235.82]  the one with the exit door
[5235.82 --> 5236.56]  makes a noise
[5236.56 --> 5238.22]  so that you can go find the door
[5238.22 --> 5238.82]  because otherwise,
[5239.10 --> 5240.98]  people just get completely disoriented.
[5240.98 --> 5241.60]  That's pretty cool.
[5242.04 --> 5243.26]  And they're completely
[5243.26 --> 5243.96]  immersed in it.
[5244.16 --> 5244.58]  That's cool.
[5244.70 --> 5245.62]  And then the last topic
[5245.62 --> 5246.58]  that I have today
[5246.58 --> 5249.24]  is there's a Watch Dogs mod.
[5250.22 --> 5250.80]  I was worried
[5250.80 --> 5251.30]  you were going to go
[5251.30 --> 5251.84]  to this one.
[5252.74 --> 5253.20]  Oh, actually,
[5253.26 --> 5253.92]  I guess there's one.
[5254.04 --> 5255.12]  Verizon claims Netflix
[5255.12 --> 5255.98]  is the one causing
[5255.98 --> 5256.86]  internet congestion.
[5258.00 --> 5258.88]  But apparently they actually
[5258.88 --> 5260.38]  have like really solid data.
[5260.82 --> 5261.22]  Yeah.
[5261.80 --> 5262.80]  So where they're legitimately
[5262.80 --> 5264.18]  trying to make the ISPs
[5264.18 --> 5265.40]  look bad by choosing
[5265.40 --> 5266.26]  crappy routes.
[5266.52 --> 5266.76]  Yeah.
[5267.16 --> 5268.02]  That's not good.
[5268.18 --> 5269.46]  That's sort of terrible.
[5269.72 --> 5270.58]  Like Verizon sucks,
[5270.74 --> 5271.58]  but that's still not good.
[5271.60 --> 5271.90]  Yeah.
[5272.26 --> 5273.56]  So there you go.
[5275.54 --> 5276.90]  Too hot for TV.
[5277.22 --> 5277.96]  You're going to not want
[5277.96 --> 5278.60]  that to go.
[5278.70 --> 5279.10]  Yeah, I know.
[5279.20 --> 5279.42]  I know.
[5279.56 --> 5279.72]  I know.
[5279.76 --> 5279.94]  I know.
[5280.02 --> 5280.84]  So basically,
[5281.18 --> 5281.60]  there you go.
[5281.70 --> 5283.10]  That's Aiden Pierce
[5283.10 --> 5284.96]  with this particular
[5284.96 --> 5285.84]  Watch Dogs mod.
[5288.36 --> 5289.30]  That makes sense.
[5289.38 --> 5290.26]  And he paused it
[5290.26 --> 5291.84]  at the exact right second.
[5292.74 --> 5293.42]  Good work.
[5293.56 --> 5293.74]  Yep.
[5293.86 --> 5294.58]  That was about to get
[5294.58 --> 5296.88]  a lot less safe for work
[5296.88 --> 5298.74]  than it was right there.
[5299.34 --> 5299.74]  So,
[5299.74 --> 5302.50]  that's pretty much it.
[5303.14 --> 5303.40]  Oh,
[5303.52 --> 5303.84]  no.
[5304.04 --> 5305.06]  I have one more thing.
[5305.42 --> 5306.80]  So you guys still have
[5306.80 --> 5307.78]  a little bit more time,
[5308.24 --> 5309.90]  but I'm amazed
[5309.90 --> 5310.92]  at what the response
[5310.92 --> 5311.92]  has been to this.
[5312.54 --> 5313.86]  We have a campaign
[5313.86 --> 5315.10]  going on Teespring
[5315.10 --> 5315.66]  right now
[5315.66 --> 5317.48]  to get your commemorative
[5317.48 --> 5318.70]  Highlander shirts.
[5318.70 --> 5321.14]  And 130 of you so far
[5321.14 --> 5323.22]  have bought Highlander
[5323.22 --> 5323.82]  commemorative
[5323.82 --> 5325.26]  either American Apparel
[5325.26 --> 5326.60]  Crew neck shirts,
[5327.28 --> 5328.32]  Gildan Heavy Blend
[5328.32 --> 5328.68]  hoodies,
[5328.92 --> 5330.54]  or Gildan Long Sleeves.
[5330.98 --> 5332.00]  So these are the
[5332.00 --> 5333.02]  three different options
[5333.02 --> 5333.42]  available.
[5333.80 --> 5334.78]  I'm personally
[5334.78 --> 5336.14]  maybe going to get
[5336.14 --> 5336.40]  a hoodie.
[5336.48 --> 5337.20]  I already have a shirt
[5337.20 --> 5337.92]  because I actually
[5337.92 --> 5338.42]  attended.
[5338.74 --> 5339.78]  So I already have
[5339.78 --> 5341.02]  this exact shirt.
[5341.02 --> 5341.98]  But yeah,
[5342.06 --> 5342.80]  if you guys want one,
[5342.88 --> 5343.42]  check that out.
[5343.54 --> 5343.82]  Also,
[5343.92 --> 5344.40]  Tech Syndicate
[5344.40 --> 5345.16]  has their own
[5345.16 --> 5346.42]  commemorative Highlander shirts.
[5346.74 --> 5347.42]  So theirs are a little
[5347.42 --> 5347.88]  bit different.
[5348.02 --> 5348.74]  They're monochrome.
[5348.96 --> 5349.48]  And then they have
[5349.48 --> 5349.92]  the logos
[5349.92 --> 5350.64]  and the names
[5350.64 --> 5351.46]  of the YouTube channels
[5351.46 --> 5352.16]  on the back.
[5352.52 --> 5352.98]  And I think
[5352.98 --> 5353.90]  I saw a tweet
[5353.90 --> 5354.42]  from Jimmy
[5354.42 --> 5355.26]  a little while ago.
[5355.70 --> 5356.50]  I don't know
[5356.50 --> 5357.90]  exactly what's going
[5357.90 --> 5358.34]  on with that.
[5358.40 --> 5358.88]  But I think it's
[5358.88 --> 5359.56]  available soon
[5359.56 --> 5360.34]  if it isn't already.
[5361.04 --> 5363.30]  So it doesn't really
[5363.30 --> 5364.34]  matter who you buy it
[5364.34 --> 5364.52]  from.
[5364.62 --> 5365.40]  The point is just
[5365.40 --> 5366.34]  I think they wanted
[5366.34 --> 5367.10]  some tweaks made
[5367.10 --> 5367.80]  to the design.
[5368.04 --> 5368.68]  So they wanted to
[5368.68 --> 5369.18]  put some stuff
[5369.18 --> 5369.80]  on the back.
[5369.92 --> 5370.64]  And then we wanted
[5370.64 --> 5371.58]  to offer not just
[5371.58 --> 5372.46]  t-shirts but a couple
[5372.46 --> 5373.42]  of different styles.
[5373.80 --> 5374.88]  So we kind of did
[5374.88 --> 5375.82]  our own thing with it
[5375.82 --> 5376.56]  and you can buy
[5376.56 --> 5377.02]  whatever you think
[5377.02 --> 5377.40]  is cool.
[5378.10 --> 5378.80]  Or not.
[5379.10 --> 5380.14]  Or just don't at all.
[5380.20 --> 5381.00]  That's fine too.
[5381.16 --> 5381.88]  Also okay.
[5382.20 --> 5383.08]  Yeah, also okay.
[5383.08 --> 5383.66]  I'm going to get one
[5383.66 --> 5384.68]  for my whole family
[5384.68 --> 5385.38]  and probably buy
[5385.38 --> 5386.12]  a sweater for myself.
[5387.02 --> 5388.04]  So that's me.
[5388.46 --> 5389.00]  But you know.
[5389.08 --> 5389.50]  Oh yeah, it's
[5389.50 --> 5390.24]  teespring.com
[5390.24 --> 5391.40]  slash Highlander lan.
[5392.36 --> 5392.76]  Yeah.
[5392.90 --> 5393.70]  And if you just
[5393.70 --> 5394.66]  go to teespring.com
[5394.66 --> 5395.08]  you can click
[5395.08 --> 5396.00]  search custom apparel
[5396.00 --> 5396.50]  and if you type
[5396.50 --> 5397.04]  in Highlander
[5397.04 --> 5397.60]  it just comes up.
[5397.98 --> 5398.24]  Cool.
[5398.36 --> 5398.84]  So that also
[5398.84 --> 5399.58]  works totally fine.
[5399.80 --> 5400.40]  Teespring's actually
[5400.40 --> 5400.90]  kind of cool.
[5400.98 --> 5401.32]  It's different.
[5401.42 --> 5402.04]  We normally use
[5402.04 --> 5402.62]  district lines
[5402.62 --> 5403.02]  and the way
[5403.02 --> 5403.76]  Teespring works
[5403.76 --> 5404.62]  is you don't actually
[5404.62 --> 5405.28]  have to pre-buy
[5405.28 --> 5405.80]  your inventory
[5405.80 --> 5406.36]  like we do
[5406.36 --> 5407.10]  with district lines
[5407.10 --> 5408.26]  where we pre-print
[5408.26 --> 5408.80]  shirts and then
[5408.80 --> 5409.62]  we put them on a shelf.
[5409.98 --> 5411.06]  Whereas with Teespring
[5411.06 --> 5412.00]  you do campaigns
[5412.00 --> 5412.58]  like this
[5412.58 --> 5413.16]  where it's like
[5413.16 --> 5414.26]  okay we need a goal
[5414.26 --> 5414.98]  of 150
[5414.98 --> 5416.48]  and then our pricing
[5416.48 --> 5417.20]  from Teespring
[5417.20 --> 5418.08]  is based on
[5418.08 --> 5419.86]  achieving that goal
[5419.86 --> 5420.62]  and then they print
[5420.62 --> 5421.20]  them all at once
[5421.20 --> 5421.68]  and then ship them
[5421.68 --> 5422.02]  all at once
[5422.02 --> 5422.46]  and it's just all
[5422.46 --> 5423.14]  one campaign.
[5423.46 --> 5424.22]  I'll tell you guys
[5424.22 --> 5424.94]  now the margin
[5424.94 --> 5425.78]  is a lot lower
[5425.78 --> 5426.38]  for us.
[5427.64 --> 5428.38]  Like these are
[5428.38 --> 5430.20]  costing multiple
[5430.20 --> 5431.64]  dollars more
[5431.64 --> 5432.74]  than the ones
[5432.74 --> 5433.50]  that we have
[5433.50 --> 5436.28]  on district lines
[5436.28 --> 5438.40]  but it gives us
[5438.40 --> 5439.00]  a little bit more
[5439.00 --> 5439.98]  flexibility in certain
[5439.98 --> 5440.22]  ways.
[5440.36 --> 5441.06]  Like we can embed
[5441.06 --> 5441.84]  Teespring links
[5441.84 --> 5442.86]  within our videos.
[5444.00 --> 5444.44]  I don't know.
[5444.66 --> 5445.02]  Like it's
[5445.02 --> 5445.44]  I don't know.
[5445.52 --> 5445.96]  It's American
[5445.96 --> 5446.92]  Imperial instead
[5446.92 --> 5447.60]  of next level.
[5448.00 --> 5448.64]  No American
[5448.64 --> 5449.30]  we're doing American
[5449.30 --> 5450.00]  Imperial on district
[5450.00 --> 5450.52]  lines as well.
[5450.96 --> 5452.26]  So I don't know.
[5452.84 --> 5454.08]  It doesn't allow us
[5454.08 --> 5455.36]  to offer shirts
[5455.36 --> 5455.96]  on an ongoing
[5455.96 --> 5456.98]  basis as easily.
[5457.24 --> 5458.12]  Like on district
[5458.12 --> 5458.74]  lines it's really
[5458.74 --> 5459.46]  easy for us to
[5459.46 --> 5460.40]  just keep when
[5460.40 --> 5461.24]  show stealth in stock
[5461.24 --> 5461.84]  because that one
[5461.84 --> 5462.54]  just consistently
[5462.54 --> 5464.06]  sells like one a
[5464.06 --> 5464.92]  day or two a day
[5464.92 --> 5465.96]  and people just
[5465.96 --> 5466.64]  like it.
[5467.38 --> 5468.22]  Whereas this is
[5468.22 --> 5469.04]  very campaign based
[5469.04 --> 5469.42]  it's like hey
[5469.42 --> 5470.08]  we did this event
[5470.08 --> 5470.70]  here's a commemorative
[5470.70 --> 5471.24]  shirt we're never
[5471.24 --> 5471.74]  going to print this
[5471.74 --> 5472.04]  again.
[5472.94 --> 5473.30]  I don't know.
[5473.62 --> 5473.80]  It's interesting.
[5473.80 --> 5474.28]  Can we just use
[5474.28 --> 5474.60]  both?
[5475.42 --> 5476.06]  Yeah I think so.
[5476.16 --> 5476.46]  I mean we don't
[5476.46 --> 5477.24]  have an exclusivity
[5477.24 --> 5477.94]  deal with anyone.
[5478.12 --> 5479.10]  I'm just talking
[5479.10 --> 5480.14]  about why we do
[5480.14 --> 5480.76]  things the way we
[5480.76 --> 5481.10]  do them.
[5481.76 --> 5482.92]  In case people who
[5482.92 --> 5483.52]  watch our show are
[5483.52 --> 5484.24]  interested in the
[5484.24 --> 5484.28]  things we do.
[5484.28 --> 5484.52]  This could make
[5484.52 --> 5485.54]  sense for stuff like
[5485.54 --> 5485.98]  when we did
[5485.98 --> 5486.96]  Resolution is a
[5486.96 --> 5487.16]  Number.
[5487.54 --> 5487.80]  Yeah.
[5488.06 --> 5488.64]  And different
[5488.64 --> 5489.08]  events like
[5489.08 --> 5489.40]  Highlander.
[5489.40 --> 5490.06]  I think Resolution
[5490.06 --> 5490.76]  is a Number has
[5490.76 --> 5491.26]  staying power.
[5491.62 --> 5492.20]  I think people will
[5492.20 --> 5493.46]  still think that's a
[5493.46 --> 5494.72]  funny shirt down the
[5494.72 --> 5495.60]  road or maybe not.
[5496.54 --> 5496.96]  I don't know.
[5496.96 --> 5499.52]  I always think I'm
[5499.52 --> 5500.96]  funny though so maybe
[5500.96 --> 5502.26]  I'm biased.
[5502.58 --> 5503.14]  You didn't even make
[5503.14 --> 5503.58]  that joke.
[5504.02 --> 5504.44]  Which one?
[5504.64 --> 5505.32]  Resolution is just
[5505.32 --> 5505.56]  a number.
[5505.62 --> 5505.84]  I know.
[5506.30 --> 5507.20]  I just think my shirt
[5507.20 --> 5507.94]  about it is funny.
[5508.16 --> 5508.36]  Oh.
[5508.56 --> 5508.76]  Yeah.
[5508.98 --> 5509.28]  Okay.
[5510.40 --> 5511.10]  That makes sense.
[5511.78 --> 5512.70]  I think we still have
[5512.70 --> 5513.80]  to do Now with 30%
[5513.80 --> 5514.34]  more Gen.
[5514.34 --> 5518.14]  If you make it look
[5518.14 --> 5519.42]  like a retro ad.
[5519.66 --> 5519.96]  Yeah.
[5520.12 --> 5520.34]  Yeah.
[5520.48 --> 5520.90]  Because that's
[5520.90 --> 5521.08]  legit.
[5521.42 --> 5522.22]  Anyway I think we're
[5522.22 --> 5522.56]  done here.
[5522.62 --> 5523.18]  Gaming PCs.
[5523.42 --> 5524.38]  I am going to do a
[5524.38 --> 5525.40]  garage sale today so
[5525.40 --> 5526.04]  if you guys want to
[5526.04 --> 5526.68]  stick around there's
[5526.68 --> 5527.68]  going to be potentially
[5527.68 --> 5528.42]  some cool stuff.
[5528.50 --> 5528.80]  I don't know what
[5528.80 --> 5529.66]  happened to it all so
[5529.66 --> 5530.14]  I'll probably have to
[5530.14 --> 5530.90]  go get it but.
[5531.44 --> 5532.06]  It probably got
[5532.06 --> 5532.62]  cleaned up.
[5532.84 --> 5533.00]  Yeah.
[5533.14 --> 5533.36]  Thanks.
[5533.46 --> 5533.74]  Thanks for

[5543.42 --> 5543.74]  Yay.
[5544.34 --> 5544.92]  We should just
[5544.92 --> 5545.80]  have an outro one.
[5546.86 --> 5547.66]  Yeah but then I
[5547.66 --> 5548.28]  use up a scene.
[5548.42 --> 5549.08]  I only have 12
[5549.08 --> 5549.42]  scenes.
[5549.84 --> 5550.28]  X-flip.
[5552.38 --> 5553.02]  They should have
[5553.02 --> 5553.58]  more scenes.
[5556.22 --> 5556.82]  I don't know.
[5557.16 --> 5558.02]  Now with 30%
[5558.02 --> 5558.72]  more scenes.
[5562.62 --> 5563.40]  They should do
[5563.40 --> 5563.70]  that.
[5563.80 --> 5564.16]  X-flip.
[5565.74 --> 5566.48]  Thanks again to
