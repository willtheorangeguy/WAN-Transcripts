[0.00 → 3.00] Alright guys, it's a special...
[3.00 → 4.00] Oh...
[4.00 → 6.00] Ready.
[6.00 → 10.00] It's a special, uh, technical... technical difficulties.
[10.00 → 12.00] Ready, are you? Alright.
[12.00 → 15.00] It's a special Halloween!
[15.00 → 18.00] Episode of the WED show!
[18.00 → 20.00] I thought you were a caped badass.
[20.00 → 21.00] Yeah, I'm a caped badass.
[21.00 → 24.00] Well, if you need to cover your face like that, why wouldn't you just have a scarf?
[24.00 → 26.00] Why wouldn't you have a scarf?
[26.00 → 28.00] Because I have a cape!
[28.00 → 30.00] It's not for concealing your identity.
[30.00 → 32.00] Are you going to fight like...
[32.00 → 33.00] You can.
[33.00 → 34.00] That's so stupid.
[34.00 → 36.00] You don't want to get punched in the mouth, do you?
[38.00 → 41.00] I think Jane would beat up the caped badass.
[41.00 → 43.00] Okay, we should probably both explain our costumes.
[43.00 → 46.00] So, uh, the caped badass fights crime...
[46.00 → 48.00] Basically, he ran out of time...
[48.00 → 49.00] ...with his tattooed arms...
[49.00 → 52.00] ...and, like, grabbed stuff out of a costume closet and was like, sure...
[52.00 → 53.00] How did you know?
[53.00 → 55.00] That's exactly what I did.
[55.00 → 62.00] ...and wears a cape in green and purple to symbolize his badass ness.
[62.00 → 64.00] Ninja Turtles do something?
[64.00 → 65.00] Did you notice that it smells?
[65.00 → 66.00] No.
[66.00 → 68.00] I have owned this cape since...
[68.00 → 69.00] It does kinda smell.
[69.00 → 70.00] Here, hold on.
[70.00 → 71.00] I have actually...
[71.00 → 72.00] It just smells like old though.
[72.00 → 73.00] Yeah.
[73.00 → 74.00] It doesn't smell bad.
[74.00 → 81.00] I have owned this cape, which goes down to kinda my thighs, since I was small enough that it touched the ground when I walked.
[81.00 → 82.00] Wow.
[82.00 → 83.00] Yep.
[83.00 → 84.00] I have owned this for like 20 years.
[84.00 → 87.00] Oh, you can tell by like the threading and stuff at the top.
[87.00 → 88.00] Wow.
[88.00 → 89.00] Yeah.
[89.00 → 90.00] It's like...
[90.00 → 95.00] It's pretty old, but it has served me well through many Halloweens.
[95.00 → 97.00] And, uh, I forget where I was going with this.
[97.00 → 98.00] Right.
[98.00 → 99.00] So that's the history of my...
[99.00 → 100.00] What are you supposed to be?
[100.00 → 102.00] Linus has never seen Firefly or Serenity.
[102.00 → 105.00] So I'm Jane, um, from Firefly.
[105.00 → 106.00] Really?
[106.00 → 107.00] You bring a weapon on my show?
[107.00 → 108.00] Yeah, man.
[108.00 → 109.00] Chee-chew.
[109.00 → 110.00] Chee-chew.
[110.00 → 111.00] That's not all.
[111.00 → 112.00] I also have a grenade.
[112.00 → 114.00] That probably sounds amazing.
[114.00 → 115.00] Wow.
[115.00 → 119.00] The kinds of explosions that that grenade will set off.
[119.00 → 127.00] So I have a gun and a grenade, and I have my jeans hat, and I have a brown coat.
[127.00 → 131.00] So there's, yeah, there's some symbolism that you wouldn't understand, but it's there.
[131.00 → 133.00] Alright, so we've got a great show for you guys today.
[133.00 → 135.00] I don't know what the topics are, because I forgot my laptop.
[135.00 → 137.00] I'm going to go get those while we roll the intro.
[137.00 → 138.00] Ah, yes!
[138.00 → 140.00] Tesla is in trouble again!
[140.00 → 146.00] Not because they did anything wrong, but because other people are basically buttholes.
[146.00 → 154.00] Um, also 18-core Eons are on the way, so prepare your buttholes, because that is going to be pretty fantastic.
[154.00 → 159.00] I mean, we're already blown away with the kind of performance we're getting from our 12-core Leon.
[159.00 → 162.00] Well, that's like six more cores than a 12-core Leon.
[162.00 → 163.00] Aw, yeah.
[163.00 → 164.00] Aw, yeah, baby.
[164.00 → 166.00] Alienware GPU graphics amplifiers.
[166.00 → 169.00] We'll explain what exactly that is later.
[169.00 → 170.00] Graphics amplifier!
[170.00 → 175.00] And, unsurprisingly, yet again, an Ubisoft developer doesn't understand extremely basic concepts.
[175.00 → 177.00] And opens his mouth about it.
[177.00 → 180.00] We're not even going to give any more information than that, but we'll talk about it later on.
[180.00 → 183.00] I mean, really, is there anything else for us to even say?
[183.00 → 184.00] Is there really?
[184.00 → 188.00] That should just be a permanent bullet point, and then we can just swap out the word Ubisoft
[188.00 → 190.00] for whatever game developer is being stupid this week.
[190.00 → 193.00] Yeah, the name, and like, what title they're working on.
[193.00 → 194.00] Yeah!
[194.00 → 197.00] Alright, intro time.
[197.00 → 225.00] And our sponsors today are 5-4 Club, which is I knew where the thing was...
[225.00 → 226.00] Ah, yes!
[226.00 → 227.00] There we go!
[227.00 → 228.00] 5-4 Club!
[228.00 → 233.00] And we're going to have an offer for you today that hopefully I will actually get right.
[233.00 → 236.00] As well as Dollar Shave Club!
[236.00 → 237.00] Boo pity book!
[237.00 → 242.00] Shave time and shave money by having high quality razors delivered directly to your door!
[242.00 → 247.00] Rather than going to the store and paying too much for them for some reason.
[247.00 → 251.00] Because paying too much for things is good on The WAN Show.
[251.00 → 252.00] We like paying too much for things.
[252.00 → 254.00] Oh wait, that's not our principle at all, is it?
[254.00 → 258.00] All of our sponsors today are about spending less money and less time on things.
[258.00 → 259.00] That's interesting.
[259.00 → 261.00] That is actually kind of interesting.
[261.00 → 262.00] Spending...
[262.00 → 264.00] So you don't have to leave your house.
[264.00 → 265.00] Our sponsors today...
[265.00 → 267.00] And you can be groomed and look good when you do.
[267.00 → 268.00] Yeah!
[268.00 → 273.00] So you don't have to like go out there and do anything, but if you really need to, you
[273.00 → 274.00] can leave the house in style.
[274.00 → 281.00] So you'll always look good, because you never have to go out to retrieve supplies to look good.
[281.00 → 282.00] You'll look good without planning.
[282.00 → 285.00] You never have to do that like chores or errands look.
[285.00 → 286.00] Yeah.
[286.00 → 287.00] Where it's like all crap.
[287.00 → 290.00] Yeah, it's like actually I'm in my PJs with like...
[290.00 → 291.00] I just do that permanently though.
[291.00 → 292.00] Yeah, I know.
[292.00 → 294.00] So that's a sad thing.
[294.00 → 298.00] Okay, well I'm going to let you do the first topic here, because I need to go get my laptop,
[298.00 → 299.00] because I forgot it, so...
[299.00 → 301.00] Because you're super ready for the show today.
[301.00 → 302.00] Caped badass away!
[302.00 → 304.00] Ow!
[304.00 → 306.00] Ha ha ha ha ha!
[306.00 → 310.00] I'm sorry!
[310.00 → 314.00] He tripped on his headphone cable when he was trying to leave the room and like actually
[314.00 → 318.00] fell over while doing the caped badass thing, which was absolutely perfect.
[318.00 → 320.00] Sorry, that was hilarious.
[320.00 → 323.00] Anyway, Tesla runs into trouble again as we were talking about earlier.
[323.00 → 329.00] The US government is giving GM and other manufacturers and automakers in general preferential treatment,
[329.00 → 330.00] which is quite annoying.
[330.00 → 334.00] They're doing that because they're setting a law in, I believe, Michigan?
[334.00 → 337.00] Yeah, where you have to sell your car through an independent dealership.
[337.00 → 340.00] You can't do the showroom thing that Tesla likes doing.
[340.00 → 344.00] I've been talking about this kind of stuff all over the states for a long time.
[344.00 → 348.00] But this is more a targeted experience.
[348.00 → 355.00] So the Michigan law forbids having galleries, like I was just discussing, and Michigan customers would still be able to buy the vehicles online,
[355.00 → 362.00] or travel out of state to a corporate owned store out of state, which I think is ridiculously silly.
[362.00 → 370.00] You don't want them to be able to go to a gallery showroom where they would actually at least be able to sit in and see the car before buying it,
[370.00 → 373.00] but you're totally okay with them buying it online.
[373.00 → 375.00] What?
[375.00 → 377.00] That makes no sense at all.
[377.00 → 380.00] Like, there's a like, ugh.
[380.00 → 387.00] The independent dealership part already doesn't make sense because I hate dealing with independent dealerships every single time I have to,
[387.00 → 390.00] which has been once, but still.
[390.00 → 392.00] It sucked.
[392.00 → 396.00] I've done it two, and it sucked for me too, so that's a sample size of at least two.
[396.00 → 398.00] Oh man, absolutely fantastic.
[398.00 → 402.00] This is definitely all the sample size you would need for running an actual study of everything.
[402.00 → 410.00] And I mean, the issue is that I, like, I get independent dealerships when they have a specific value add.
[410.00 → 411.00] Yes.
[411.00 → 414.00] Beyond what the manufacturer is able to do for some reason.
[414.00 → 421.00] But if the manufacturer chooses not to work through an independent dealership, then that should be their right.
[421.00 → 424.00] You shouldn't mandate middlemen.
[424.00 → 428.00] If you could do that, you should be able to mandate out Apple stores.
[428.00 → 438.00] I mean, the merchant, the merchant class sprung up because their entire job was to facilitate the movement of goods from one place to another.
[438.00 → 452.00] So they were actually, you know, you would actually get, you know, silk from here, and then you would take it over there, and you would sell the silk, and you would buy gems, and you'd take it over there, buy low, sell high, the whole, you know, being a merchant thing.
[452.00 → 453.00] Moving it around, yeah.
[453.00 → 468.00] Being a merchant isn't about sitting on your butt in one place with the regulatory bodies just telling you, telling, telling consumers and telling manufacturers that they all have to go be routed through you so you can take a cut.
[468.00 → 471.00] Like, how does that, how does that make any sense?
[471.00 → 473.00] How does that help us progress?
[473.00 → 478.00] How does the rest of the world not completely leave the U.S. behind in the dark ages?
[478.00 → 485.00] And I don't, I don't understand, like I would, I would understand way more if say Tesla was like a non-American company.
[485.00 → 486.00] I don't care where they're from.
[486.00 → 488.00] If they were just a non-American company in general.
[488.00 → 490.00] So these laws were to try to help American companies.
[490.00 → 492.00] Tesla's an American company.
[492.00 → 494.00] They manufacture in the States.
[494.00 → 504.00] You're barring a company that manufactures their cars in the States against companies that you're not barring, which in a lot of cases don't.
[504.00 → 506.00] Which is so stupid.
[506.00 → 508.00] A lot of cars are manufactured in Mexico.
[508.00 → 517.00] I don't know a ton about car manufacturing, but I know that there are a lot of cars manufactured in Mexico that are not going to have to go through the hoops that Tesla has to go through.
[517.00 → 519.00] And they're manufacturing, designing everything in the States.
[519.00 → 521.00] Or even making their batteries in the States.
[521.00 → 524.00] They're planning on putting that battery manufacturing plant in Nevada.
[524.00 → 526.00] So like, what are you trying to accomplish here?
[526.00 → 530.00] This is a new, really exciting company that's coming out of the States.
[530.00 → 534.00] It's like they're determined to make them not want to stay there.
[534.00 → 535.00] Yeah.
[535.00 → 540.00] Like, I think the only reason why they're staying there is that like Elon likes the States.
[540.00 → 542.00] So, you're freaking lucky.
[542.00 → 544.00] Elon kind of does as he pleases, doesn't he?
[544.00 → 545.00] Yeah, he pretty much does.
[545.00 → 548.00] Alright, have we already talked about Apple versus retailers?
[548.00 → 549.00] Nope.
[549.00 → 550.00] The war on NFC payment technology.
[550.00 → 555.00] So, Apple Pay is not exactly revolutionary or groundbreaking.
[555.00 → 559.00] I mean, Google Wallet's been available for something like four years?
[559.00 → 560.00] Yeah.
[560.00 → 561.00] Or something like that?
[561.00 → 562.00] Yeah.
[562.00 → 563.00] I don't think it's been super widely used.
[563.00 → 564.00] No, no.
[564.00 → 566.00] It hasn't been super widely used.
[566.00 → 568.00] It hasn't been super widely publicized.
[568.00 → 573.00] It's one of those things where Google introduced the tech and basically went, yeah, use it or don't or whatever.
[573.00 → 574.00] Yeah.
[574.00 → 575.00] And that's fine.
[575.00 → 583.00] But Apple Pay, pretty much just for those of you who aren't familiar, uses an NFC chip in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in order to enable it.
[583.00 → 587.00] And I think the new iPads also have it as well.
[587.00 → 588.00] Really?
[588.00 → 589.00] Yeah.
[589.00 → 590.00] Trying to pay with this giant iPad.
[590.00 → 591.00] Could be wrong about that one.
[591.00 → 596.00] I hope I'm wrong about that one because that's going to be a whole new level of pad hole.
[596.00 → 599.00] Like, you can take your pictures of your crew in the restaurant.
[599.00 → 600.00] Selfie.
[600.00 → 601.00] Yeah.
[601.00 → 602.00] iPad selfie.
[602.00 → 603.00] Yeah.
[603.00 → 604.00] Yeah.
[604.00 → 605.00] And like, iPad tap to pay.
[605.00 → 608.00] You can take your selfie with your iPhone as you pay with your iPad just to show how stupid it is.
[608.00 → 609.00] That would be fantastic.
[609.00 → 618.00] Oh, so, so anyway, so it's, it uses the NFC chip, unfortunately, for what is the least useful thing possible for me because Apple Pay isn't even rolled out in Canada.
[618.00 → 623.00] There is no timeline for Canada and I really wish we were able to do simple things like file transfers and stuff like that.
[623.00 → 624.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[624.00 → 628.00] Um, but no, no, Apple needs to forge their own path, don't they?
[628.00 → 639.00] So, so basically it uses your NFC chip at those same terminals that if you're in an enlightened country like Australia of all places, for some reason it's like way ahead of the rest of the world on this stuff,
[639.00 → 645.00] allows you to simply tap your device, authenticate using a, a pin code or your touch ID even,
[645.00 → 654.00] and then pay for something with a debit or credit card without ever actually giving the retailer access to those credit card numbers or anything like that.
[654.00 → 655.00] Yeah.
[655.00 → 666.00] So that huge target breach, that huge Home Depot breach, we're talking 40 and 56 million customer credit cards that were compromised in each of those respectively,
[666.00 → 669.00] if I have those numbers correct, don't quote me on that.
[669.00 → 678.00] There, there would be no potential for that if you used Apple Pay for everything because the idea is that it actually stores the information in the same place on the phone as your touch ID information,
[678.00 → 685.00] which is not sent to Apple servers. Very freaking cool stuff. Of course, you have to register the bank accounts and credit cards and all that,
[685.00 → 696.00] but the point is, the idea is that it will be more secure and Apple's taking a fairly small cut on top of what a credit card would already be taking.
[696.00 → 697.00] Right, right.
[697.00 → 705.00] I think it's, shoot, now this is, this is a detail that I actually forget. Um, I think it's 0.15%.
[705.00 → 706.00] I'm not sure.
[706.00 → 721.00] Apple Pay fee 0.15. I'm going to try searching for that. Yeah. Apple gets 0.15% cut of the purchase. So actually they're not trying to go in, be a credit card with credit card like margins.
[721.00 → 728.00] I mean, often credit cards are in the three plus percent range. I hope you guys realize that when you buy something with a credit card,
[728.00 → 733.00] every retailer in the world that accepts credit cards is basically just increasing their prices by three and a half,
[733.00 → 741.00] four and a half percent in order to compensate for that because they take those rewards that you get that are from the air miles,
[741.00 → 745.00] cash back. They're just giving you back some of what they already took from you.
[745.00 → 750.00] The reason why they're pushing people to use credit cards and giving them these reward programs is because they skim money off it all the time.
[750.00 → 757.00] Yeah. It's not even necessarily because of the interest they get from you not paying it because you don't understand compound interest.
[757.00 → 761.00] But, so anyway, Apple's pitch to the banks in the States was, look, we're going to increase security.
[761.00 → 770.00] We're going to reduce credit card fraud, which should reduce your insurance premiums because every time someone fraudulently uses your credit card to buy a Hummer,
[770.00 → 782.00] either kind of course, any time someone uses your credit card to make some kind of purchase and that item doesn't get tracked down and returned,
[782.00 → 790.00] well, somebody has to pay for that. And because of credit card fraud prevention and the way that most credit card issuers will protect the consumer,
[790.00 → 795.00] you're going to get a refund as long as you follow the proper steps in order to report that stuff.
[795.00 → 805.00] Someone has to pay for that. So if Apple kind of goes, well, look, any of our customers who use your card through Apple Pay will reduce the potential for fraudulent use,
[805.00 → 811.00] making life easier for you guys. Well, hey, that's worth the 0.15%, isn't it? We're making life better for everyone.
[811.00 → 819.00] Well, retailers are butt hurt now apparently, which is pretty frustrating to me.
[819.00 → 829.00] And it looks like even though we're not getting statements from companies like CVS and Rite Aid in the U.S. that have stopped accepting Apple Pay,
[829.00 → 833.00] I mean, we're talking some retailers, you actually, Apple Pay was working?
[833.00 → 835.00] Yeah, and then they stopped.
[835.00 → 837.00] Was working. And then they shut it off.
[837.00 → 838.00] Yeah.
[838.00 → 842.00] And you'll get an error message on the cashier. You can actually see the error message. It says,
[842.00 → 862.00] Apple Pay not supported or something like that. And they're not issuing statements necessarily, but the speculation is that they're developing their own NFC payment software in order to save the 2 to 3% per transaction that they would normally have to pay to now Apple plus a credit card company or bank or whatever else the case may be.
[862.00 → 886.00] I mean, normally I'm not a huge fan of any kind of proprietary standard, but the thing about Apple's proprietary standard here is all you really have to do is give them a fee that is going to save you money and effort in the big picture in order to manage this system that really anyone, as long as they cooperate, can buy into.
[886.00 → 892.00] Wouldn't you have to pay the Apple fee and the credit card fee? So wouldn't it not save you money in the future? Wouldn't it cost you-
[892.00 → 899.00] Not for the retailer, yes. But the retailer should be more concerned about the customer experience in my mind.
[899.00 → 900.00] Yeah.
[900.00 → 913.00] The retailer is going to want to be as appealing as possible. I mean, I forget what the number is, but I think they've got over a million people activated on Apple Pay already. Like, massive, massive numbers.
[913.00 → 925.00] So if you're a retailer and you kind of sit there and go, oh, well gee, I guess I want 0.3% of the population who are evidently all interested in this easier, more secure way to pay for things.
[925.00 → 931.00] I guess I want them to not shop at my store because I'd rather release my own competing standard.
[931.00 → 945.00] I mean, at least the thing about Apple is that their standard will not help a direct, unless you directly compete with the Apple Store. Their standard, paying Apple to use it will not directly help a competitor.
[945.00 → 958.00] Whereas if we have every pharmacy chain and every clothing chain coming up with their own NFC payment systems that you have to have your own app, and you have to enter the payment information, and you have to have separate management tools.
[958.00 → 964.00] Well, that is much more fragmented than even Apple's still relatively closed garden system.
[964.00 → 972.00] I don't know if it's actually going to stop people from shopping at certain stores because I'm sure they'll still carry their debit and or credit cards with them.
[972.00 → 982.00] So I don't know if it'll actually stop them at least yet, but it could be a future thing where you want to stop carrying cards entirely when a lot more stores are picking it up and a lot more people are using this type of technology.
[982.00 → 1000.00] But that's exactly what we want. Okay, so two things. First, I disagree. I think that for certain people, for tech enthusiasts who are like into that, they will look if it's is it's like I'm standing here and there's Walgreens and there's CVS and one of them takes Apple Pay and one of them doesn't.
[1000.00 → 1004.00] I think the tech geek in me goes, I'm going to go to Walgreens.
[1004.00 → 1007.00] Really? Yeah, for sure. Why not? I could not give a crap.
[1007.00 → 1019.00] The pricing is basically similar. So let's say all other things equal. They both carry, you know, XL size condoms, the kind I need. Right? So it doesn't matter which one I go into.
[1019.00 → 1027.00] I'll be safe either way. Okay. I love how it's not like brand or reliability. It's just like sizing. Yeah.
[1027.00 → 1035.00] My gun just fell out. That was pretty good timing. Your gun fell out? Did it leave a mess in your pouch there? Yeah.
[1035.00 → 1041.00] I mean, this show is awful. Yeah. Speaking of this show is awful, my mom watched the mineral oil video. Oh, yeah.
[1041.00 → 1047.00] And was like, oh, it was so awesome. And so it didn't bring up like the endless amount of innuendos.
[1047.00 → 1055.00] It's like, thanks mom. I mean, you know what? Here, I want to hear from you guys. Let's do a Twitter blitz. So hit me at...
[1055.00 → 1061.00] Would it change your purchasing decision? Yeah. Would it change your purchasing decision? And let's not lock it into Apple Pay.
[1061.00 → 1067.00] I don't want this to be about Apple Pay necessarily. I want this to be about more progressive payment technologies.
[1067.00 → 1075.00] So let's say the shop supports Google Wallet or Apple Pay or some kind of cool touchless smartphone enabled payment technology that you care about.
[1075.00 → 1084.00] I just... See, my thing is I care less... Like I still think it's cool, but I care less about that than other metrics.
[1084.00 → 1088.00] Now, if it's going with what you're saying where the stores are exactly identical...
[1088.00 → 1089.00] Yeah.
[1089.00 → 1091.00] ...other than the NFC Pay thing, like sure, I'll go there.
[1091.00 → 1100.00] But like the store I buy video games from because I really like that store and I want to be able to support them because they're cool.
[1100.00 → 1101.00] Right.
[1101.00 → 1114.00] I'm not going to stop going there because they don't have an NFC payment system because they probably wouldn't be the first ones to adopt that because they're this tiny little store and changing things like their debit machines is probably not something they're super worried about.
[1114.00 → 1121.00] So this might come down to more like five years from now, eight years from now when everyone has NFC payment systems, but it's going to come down to...
[1121.00 → 1123.00] Because it's default on the debit machines that you buy.
[1123.00 → 1129.00] Right. So it's going to come down to do they support the system that you use most in your daily life?
[1129.00 → 1130.00] Yeah.
[1130.00 → 1143.00] Like if you're a Google Wallet user, or you're a, you know, Apple Pay user, do you go to the one that supports the one that you generally use or do you go to the one that's a pain in the butt because they have their own stupid proprietary thing?
[1143.00 → 1154.00] So as it happens, the retailers that we were talking about are members of MCX, and they're working on their own mobile payment system, Current C.
[1154.00 → 1157.00] Currency, haha, currency, get it? But modern?
[1157.00 → 1158.00] Ohhhhhhhhhh.
[1158.00 → 1159.00] Currency, actually I think it's kind of clever.
[1159.00 → 1161.00] Which is in beta and expected to launch next year.
[1161.00 → 1163.00] It requires you to scan a barcode though.
[1163.00 → 1167.00] There's like a QR code involved as well, I think, in order to make payments.
[1167.00 → 1175.00] And it's something that's been proven as not being as secure as near field communication and other encrypted technologies that are used by Apple Pay and Google Wallet.
[1175.00 → 1180.00] So here we go, Twitter Blitz time.
[1180.00 → 1185.00] Apple Pay and Google Wallet are just niche services so they can tick off boxes on their marketing.
[1185.00 → 1187.00] PayPal should be introduced first.
[1187.00 → 1188.00] Interesting point.
[1188.00 → 1189.00] I would use PayPal.
[1189.00 → 1190.00] Yeah, I would uh...
[1190.00 → 1193.00] I would use your PayPal app to pay for things.
[1193.00 → 1195.00] Yeah, I would probably be interested in PayPal as well.
[1195.00 → 1196.00] I generally like PayPal.
[1196.00 → 1200.00] I think it should have been making more progress in the last few years.
[1200.00 → 1201.00] Um...
[1201.00 → 1205.00] It feels like PayPal had such an opportunity to do a Bitcoin-y type thing.
[1205.00 → 1206.00] Or something.
[1206.00 → 1207.00] Or something.
[1207.00 → 1208.00] Yeah.
[1208.00 → 1210.00] Like there was room for innovation there.
[1210.00 → 1211.00] Um...
[1211.00 → 1217.00] Elon, the guy who, like, co-started it or whatever, has publicly talked about how they've been kind of disappointing.
[1217.00 → 1218.00] Right.
[1218.00 → 1219.00] Lately.
[1219.00 → 1223.00] Okay, a little off-topic, but if a store supports Google Wallet, will they automatically support Apple Pay?
[1223.00 → 1224.00] In some cases, yes.
[1224.00 → 1229.00] Apple Pay was just working, even though they weren't on Apple's list of launch retailers.
[1229.00 → 1232.00] Actually, the ones we're talking about are great examples of that.
[1232.00 → 1237.00] And the funny thing about these guys is they've also turned off Google Wallet at the same time.
[1237.00 → 1238.00] Oh, wow.
[1238.00 → 1240.00] Even though Google Wallet's been working now for years.
[1240.00 → 1241.00] Wow.
[1241.00 → 1242.00] Yeah.
[1242.00 → 1243.00] Um, okay.
[1243.00 → 1246.00] Honestly, no one can hack cash, so that's what I use.
[1246.00 → 1247.00] Well, there are other issues with cash.
[1247.00 → 1248.00] Yeah.
[1248.00 → 1250.00] Um, you can hack cash in real life.
[1250.00 → 1251.00] You know, like, where's that gun?
[1251.00 → 1252.00] That crowbar.
[1252.00 → 1254.00] That gun, that crowbar.
[1254.00 → 1258.00] Do we look like people who could hack cash?
[1258.00 → 1259.00] Hack your cash, bro.
[1259.00 → 1260.00] We need a shirt.
[1260.00 → 1261.00] We do.
[1261.00 → 1262.00] Cash hackers.
[1262.00 → 1263.00] I have a grenade too.
[1263.00 → 1264.00] Cash hackers.
[1264.00 → 1265.00] Just cause it makes no sense.
[1265.00 → 1266.00] Ah!
[1266.00 → 1272.00] Anyway, um, if your credit card's stolen, they can reverse a lot of the charges that happened
[1272.00 → 1273.00] on it.
[1273.00 → 1275.00] If your cash is stolen, you're screwed.
[1275.00 → 1276.00] Your cash is just gone.
[1276.00 → 1277.00] Yeah.
[1277.00 → 1279.00] Uh, that's actually in line with Josh's comment here.
[1279.00 → 1281.00] Cash is always going to be there.
[1281.00 → 1282.00] Nope.
[1282.00 → 1285.00] I don't care about any of them because no one accepts them here.
[1285.00 → 1286.00] Good point.
[1286.00 → 1291.00] And it's the same in Canada, but we should still look to this technology as an indication
[1291.00 → 1292.00] of what's coming in the future.
[1292.00 → 1297.00] Um, I would go to the store that supports the technology because I want to spread the
[1297.00 → 1298.00] tech and make it more pervasive.
[1298.00 → 1299.00] And that is a very-
[1299.00 → 1300.00] That's always a thing.
[1300.00 → 1301.00] Yeah.
[1301.00 → 1302.00] That's a compelling reason to do it.
[1302.00 → 1303.00] That's a voting with your wallet.
[1303.00 → 1304.00] That's like, literally voting with your wallet.
[1304.00 → 1305.00] Literally.
[1305.00 → 1306.00] Your Google wallet.
[1306.00 → 1307.00] Yeah.
[1307.00 → 1308.00] Or voting with your pay.
[1308.00 → 1309.00] Your Apple Pay.
[1309.00 → 1310.00] Nah.
[1310.00 → 1315.00] See, this is an even more badass fist bump because it's got the cat sleeves and the
[1315.00 → 1316.00] jacket.
[1316.00 → 1317.00] Anyway.
[1317.00 → 1318.00] Name here.
[1318.00 → 1321.00] It would totally sway my choice.
[1321.00 → 1322.00] Not really in Oz.
[1322.00 → 1325.00] It is 50-50 to get Pay Wave as it is when they do have it.
[1325.00 → 1326.00] It is so much easier.
[1326.00 → 1327.00] Yeah.
[1327.00 → 1328.00] So Pay Wave is their NFC thing.
[1328.00 → 1330.00] I think we call it Pay Pass here in Canada.
[1330.00 → 1331.00] Yeah, but like-
[1331.00 → 1332.00] Like, never works.
[1332.00 → 1336.00] And every single machine you see has a little sticker on it, Pay Pass not working.
[1336.00 → 1337.00] Yeah.
[1337.00 → 1338.00] Or something.
[1338.00 → 1339.00] If I had it, I would use it like a boss.
[1339.00 → 1344.00] Um, S Oliver says, cash or cards are obsolete, but NFC payments are still too scary or sketchy
[1344.00 → 1346.00] to me, although I know how they work.
[1346.00 → 1347.00] Very interesting.
[1347.00 → 1349.00] We should probably do the fastest possible episode on NFC payments.
[1349.00 → 1350.00] Probably.
[1350.00 → 1353.00] Just try and cut through some of the garbage information that's out there about it.
[1353.00 → 1354.00] Yeah.
[1354.00 → 1355.00] Yeah.
[1355.00 → 1356.00] Yes.
[1356.00 → 1359.00] All else being equal, I would go to the place with the more progressive payment style, says
[1359.00 → 1360.00] Joe Zoo.
[1360.00 → 1361.00] Uh, Josh says, nope.
[1361.00 → 1366.00] It's just another iteration of something like PayPal or Bitcoin, which is not really anything-
[1366.00 → 1367.00] Actually, it's not really anything like-
[1367.00 → 1368.00] No.
[1368.00 → 1369.00] Like PayPal or Bitcoin.
[1369.00 → 1370.00] No.
[1370.00 → 1373.00] Because you're still just using your debit account or your credit account.
[1373.00 → 1376.00] It's just another way of accessing it without a card, electronically.
[1376.00 → 1377.00] Yeah.
[1377.00 → 1378.00] Hi, Jack.
[1378.00 → 1380.00] Oh, would you-Oh.
[1380.00 → 1382.00] Oh, everything else being equal, sure.
[1382.00 → 1384.00] I'd take the store that makes buying things easier.
[1384.00 → 1388.00] I mean, I think the web-Here, we're gonna, uh, we're gonna Twitter blitzing this here.
[1388.00 → 1390.00] I think the web has proven that.
[1390.00 → 1392.00] Look at Amazon's model.
[1392.00 → 1394.00] Do they have the lowest price?
[1394.00 → 1395.00] Not necessarily.
[1395.00 → 1396.00] They're just the easiest to deal with.
[1396.00 → 1398.00] In fact, a lot of the times they don't.
[1398.00 → 1400.00] Why are they so big?
[1400.00 → 1403.00] Because they make shopping easy and brainless.
[1403.00 → 1407.00] They have everything, and you can order with one click-
[1407.00 → 1410.00] And their customer service is, like, very well known everywhere.
[1410.00 → 1411.00] Yep.
[1411.00 → 1412.00] Talked about widely.
[1412.00 → 1414.00] And you don't have to do any thinking.
[1414.00 → 1417.00] You don't have to think about, oh, how much is the shipping gonna cost?
[1417.00 → 1419.00] And you don't usually have to worry about it being late.
[1419.00 → 1422.00] Usually, more often than not, they're early if it has to be late or early.
[1422.00 → 1423.00] They're usually early.
[1423.00 → 1424.00] That's right.
[1424.00 → 1429.00] I had a shipment that was supposed to show up in, like, I think it was seven to ten business days and it was there the next day.
[1429.00 → 1430.00] I was like, what?
[1430.00 → 1435.00] That, that to me is, is the biggest thing that retailers should be looking at.
[1435.00 → 1442.00] If they're trying to decide, should we support Apple Pay or Google Wallet or MCX's upcoming standard or whatever else?
[1442.00 → 1444.00] And the answer should be yesed.
[1444.00 → 1448.00] Because you want your store to be easy to shop at.
[1448.00 → 1451.00] That being said, Amazon doesn't accept PayPal.
[1451.00 → 1456.00] Amazon doesn't accept PayPal, which is actually, continues to be a frustration for me.
[1456.00 → 1463.00] And if someone were to rise up and be otherwise equal to Amazon in every other way, I would choose the one that takes PayPal personally.
[1463.00 → 1465.00] What's that, what's that thing from the Wall-E movie, Buy and...
[1465.00 → 1466.00] Buy and large.
[1466.00 → 1467.00] Buy and large.
[1467.00 → 1468.00] Yeah.
[1468.00 → 1470.00] I'm waiting for Costco to go e-tail.
[1470.00 → 1472.00] Because I just have a feeling that would be awesome.
[1472.00 → 1473.00] Costco's badass.
[1473.00 → 1474.00] I love Costco.
[1474.00 → 1475.00] I'd be down for Costco e-tail.
[1475.00 → 1476.00] Alright.
[1476.00 → 1480.00] So our next, actually, have we called out the people who posted these on the forum?
[1480.00 → 1488.00] Okay, so that was LJKS Snow that posted the Apple versus retailers topic and Victorious Secret that posted the Tesla one.
[1488.00 → 1494.00] And our original articles were from finance.yahoo.com and WashingtonPost.com.
[1494.00 → 1498.00] So let's move on to some good news, some exciting news.
[1498.00 → 1501.00] This was posted by SACRAL on the forum.
[1501.00 → 1506.00] The original article here is from Digitizes and this looks freaking awesome.
[1506.00 → 1513.00] When I heard the announcement for this, I'm not even going to say what it is yet, but when I heard the announcement for this, I assumed it was coming way further in the future than it is.
[1513.00 → 1514.00] Mm-hmm.
[1514.00 → 1518.00] I didn't expect quarter two 2015 according to Digitizes.
[1518.00 → 1520.00] Now this is rumour.
[1520.00 → 1524.00] There's no content from that comment, not content, comment from Intel yet.
[1524.00 → 1526.00] Yeah, Intel won't say anything about it.
[1526.00 → 1527.00] But...
[1527.00 → 1536.00] Apparently, as we said in the topic call out, the 18-core Leon E7 V3 Haswell-E3 is coming.
[1536.00 → 1541.00] So, we have more videos on Easel's processor coming, don't we?
[1541.00 → 1542.00] Yes, we do.
[1542.00 → 1546.00] So the whole room water cooling loop thing, we'll talk about temperatures and stuff a little bit.
[1546.00 → 1551.00] And we have a video upcoming where we got our hands on a 128-gig kit of RAM.
[1551.00 → 1561.00] And Easel's actually spent most of this week benchmarking various numbers of cores and various amounts of RAM in Premiere and After Effects
[1561.00 → 1567.00] to have a look at where the sweet spot is for processing cores and RAM and how those relate to each other.
[1567.00 → 1569.00] So that should be a really cool video for content creators.
[1569.00 → 1570.00] Yeah, that should be really cool.
[1570.00 → 1572.00] There we go, my screen sharing.
[1572.00 → 1573.00] Hooray!
[1573.00 → 1575.00] So this one's actually the article on Kit Guru.
[1575.00 → 1589.00] But this bad boy, a Leon E7 V3 Haswell EX chip with 18 hyper-threaded cores, quad-channel DDR4 memory support,
[1589.00 → 1598.00] integrated PCI Express 3.0 and rumoured, according to Digitizes, to be available in Q2 2015.
[1598.00 → 1603.00] However, the Digitizes article is down, and this one specifically says Intel is not commenting on it.
[1603.00 → 1610.00] So I wonder if our link to the Digitizes one is bad for some reason or whatever else is happening.
[1610.00 → 1617.00] Yeah, so I don't know, there isn't a ton of groundbreaking stuff here other than the fact that it has a butt-ton of cores.
[1617.00 → 1618.00] Yeah.
[1618.00 → 1619.00] There's not really a lot else going on other than that.
[1619.00 → 1622.00] We're talking like a Nicki Minaj worth of cores.
[1622.00 → 1623.00] Oh yeah.
[1623.00 → 1624.00] Yeah.
[1624.00 → 1625.00] Yeah.
[1625.00 → 1627.00] My Anaconda wants some of that.
[1627.00 → 1628.00] Does it?
[1628.00 → 1629.00] Well, CPU cores, not really Nicki Minaj.
[1629.00 → 1630.00] She's a little old for me.
[1630.00 → 1631.00] Is she?
[1631.00 → 1632.00] Yeah!
[1632.00 → 1633.00] How old is she?
[1633.00 → 1636.00] I think she's like well into her 30s or something.
[1636.00 → 1637.00] Oh.
[1637.00 → 1639.00] Nicki Minaj, I don't even know how to spell her name.
[1639.00 → 1640.00] Oops.
[1640.00 → 1641.00] Nicki Minaj age.
[1641.00 → 1642.00] I don't know.
[1642.00 → 1643.00] She's 31.
[1643.00 → 1644.00] Oh, never mind.
[1644.00 → 1646.00] Okay, she's not as old as I thought she was.
[1646.00 → 1647.00] Never mind.
[1647.00 → 1649.00] She would still be an older lady for me though.
[1649.00 → 1651.00] Cougar town.
[1651.00 → 1652.00] I'm...
[1652.00 → 1654.00] That and I'm married, I guess.
[1654.00 → 1655.00] That might be an issue.
[1655.00 → 1663.28] So, okay, this is not a tech topic, but one of my old co-workers got married, didn't tell
[1663.28 → 1669.76] me, didn't have any ceremony, has no ring, went to the courthouse because he lives in
[1669.76 → 1677.14] Toronto and he and his now wife, I guess, both work in the IT industry, and they were both
[1677.14 → 1678.74] in Vancouver on travel.
[1678.74 → 1683.52] And when you're in Toronto, I think it's like an eight-week process to get a civil union marriage
[1683.52 → 1684.58] certificate thing.
[1684.58 → 1688.38] And when you're in Vancouver, I think it's three weeks to get everything pushed through
[1688.38 → 1689.62] and make it official.
[1689.62 → 1695.76] So while they were here, they were, they're trying to move to the US and I think she has
[1695.76 → 1699.90] a green card, and he doesn't or something and citizenship or whatever.
[1699.90 → 1702.34] So they had to contact someone, they contacted you?
[1702.34 → 1703.34] So, what?
[1703.34 → 1704.34] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1704.34 → 1705.34] He was just telling me he got married.
[1705.34 → 1706.34] Oh, by the way, I got married.
[1706.34 → 1709.72] I'm like, thanks for the invitation to your wedding, jackass.
[1709.72 → 1712.72] And he was like, well, there wasn't a wedding or a honeymoon.
[1712.72 → 1716.88] Our honeymoon was like, we drove down to Seattle and both met with clients.
[1716.88 → 1720.02] And I'm just like, no, you're terrible.
[1720.02 → 1720.88] You're a bad person.
[1720.88 → 1725.14] So anyway, apparently they, they, they just spontaneously.
[1725.14 → 1726.32] And it was her idea.
[1726.32 → 1728.92] Apparently she was just like, oh, Hey, we're both in Vancouver.
[1728.92 → 1735.22] We should probably get that marriage thing done so that everything goes through more quickly.
[1735.22 → 1739.68] And he's like, yeah, I guess I should go to London drugs and like get the paperwork for him.
[1739.68 → 1747.48] Can you imagine if you could find a lady who is so pragmatic that you could get away with something like that?
[1748.06 → 1749.32] That's, that's probably who I'm going to ask.
[1749.32 → 1750.20] Is that your dream lady?
[1750.28 → 1750.80] Yeah, probably.
[1751.48 → 1752.84] I don't, I don't know.
[1752.92 → 1754.78] I don't know where you find these ladies.
[1754.86 → 1755.34] Because I mean, okay.
[1755.48 → 1760.86] My wife is pretty practical, and she's pretty down to earth, but she wanted a wedding, man.
[1761.02 → 1762.02] She wanted a wedding.
[1762.26 → 1767.32] She wanted a ring, big ring, big wedding, honeymoon.
[1767.32 → 1769.38] You don't get out of that stuff.
[1770.02 → 1770.64] I don't know.
[1770.66 → 1771.74] I don't know how you pulled this off.
[1772.22 → 1772.56] I don't know.
[1772.76 → 1777.70] As generations get younger, weddings and rings and stuff are slowly becoming less and less of a thing.
[1779.34 → 1781.36] Marriage is even becoming less and less of a thing.
[1781.54 → 1782.76] This isn't a tech topic.
[1782.86 → 1784.04] We should probably move on.
[1784.12 → 1784.38] All right.
[1784.40 → 1792.16] So Apple Watch OS running on an iPhone is, this is kind of a speculative article from a nine to five.
[1792.30 → 1794.16] Mac actually did a really great job of this.
[1794.16 → 1797.56] This was, this was originally posted on the forum by day 26.
[1798.16 → 1799.54] So let's go ahead and pop this up.
[1799.62 → 1802.38] And I love this article.
[1802.64 → 1803.34] One quick thing.
[1803.46 → 1803.68] Yes.
[1803.70 → 1805.38] It's not Apple Watch OS.
[1806.06 → 1806.82] Yeah, it's not.
[1806.90 → 1807.28] At all.
[1807.46 → 1807.94] We're talking.
[1808.16 → 1808.52] Not even slightly.
[1808.62 → 1808.94] Thank you.
[1809.08 → 1812.68] We're not talking about Apple Watch OS running on iPhones in the future.
[1812.68 → 1825.92] We're talking about the, the, the UI design with the apps being just kind of in this, this kind of scatter array versus the tidy, less dense grid.
[1825.92 → 1830.68] We're talking about that potentially coming to the iPhone.
[1830.68 → 1832.82] I was amazed at how well this worked.
[1833.14 → 1849.08] This is brilliant because this is what I was, in my iPhone six review, my biggest criticism of the phone was the way that Apple just didn't innovate when they had to.
[1849.08 → 1854.16] They should, they should have iOS eight should have come with this already.
[1854.16 → 1862.48] So I'm still going to be critical, even if they do roll this out, because the device has outgrown the way that Apple expects you to interact with it.
[1862.52 → 1873.02] The, the app ecosystem, I mean, back when the and this article does a great job, great article on nine to five Mac, because when the app, when the iPhone first launched with iPhone OS, which is what we used to call it.
[1873.02 → 1880.92] There weren't really many third party apps. You didn't need to organize things into folders. There, there wasn't that much to do.
[1880.92 → 1881.18] Yeah.
[1881.18 → 1891.90] And because every phone could be operated one-handed by most people, stuff that you, you know, the highest priority stuff could automatically go to the top left corner, and you could actually reach that.
[1891.96 → 1898.16] But nowadays, it's the bottom right to centre of the screen. That's actually easiest to access. And I love what they've done here.
[1898.16 → 1904.38] Now I, I don't even necessarily like this because you've seen how I use things. My, my desktop on my phone is blank.
[1904.38 → 1917.06] Um, not even kidding. My default, like the first page you go to on my phone is blank. My desktop on all of my computers are, uh, view do not show icons so that I have no icons, including no recycle bin.
[1917.16 → 1926.18] Because I don't like anything being there. Um, I like extremely clean for all of my devices. So this looks incredibly messy to me and I don't want it,
[1926.18 → 1936.92] but I think it's extremely cool that it exists because I do know a lot of people that will want it, and it opens the door to other various themes and maybe slight adaptations of this whole idea,
[1936.92 → 1944.48] which is actually really cool and how well it works, how you can zoom out to see the whole picture and then jump to a different area can make navigation really fast.
[1944.48 → 1951.38] Yeah. Much faster than swiping three pages over or even entering pages over and then going into a folder.
[1951.38 → 1958.88] Yup. This is a horrible combination going over a few pages, then going into a folder would take forever when you can just tap in between some of the icons,
[1958.88 → 1964.88] which will zoom it all the way out and then tap on an icon, which will zoom it in and then tap on the icon again, which will open the actual app.
[1964.88 → 1972.38] And the, the article makes some great arguments for how easy this would be to, to adopt. Like folders wouldn't have to go away.
[1972.38 → 1980.38] It could just work like this. Icons wouldn't even necessarily have to be redesigned. Oh, yeah. And they, they make the same complaint about Apple's stupid accessibility,
[1980.38 → 1986.78] double tap thing that I did where it's like, what, what is that? That's just the sludgiest thing ever. And they even looked at this and went, well, hold on a second.
[1986.78 → 1994.78] What if we just take existing icons now and make them all circles? Actually, it kind of looks like you don't have to change much. Doesn't it?
[1994.78 → 2000.28] No, no, like not at all. Loving it. That's cool. I would really like to see this happen.
[2000.28 → 2005.08] Which, what I'm assuming this is some travel thing. That one doesn't look super great. Yeah. Some of them.
[2005.08 → 2014.08] Most of the other ones look fine. Some of them don't work particularly well, but the reality of it is, is app developers are going to have a round icon anyway.
[2014.08 → 2027.08] If they want their app to show up on, on the watch. Yeah. So I guess, why don't we just all move to, I wonder if when the watch launches, we'll get like kind of like,
[2027.08 → 2036.08] because I can't imagine iOS has operated exactly the same way for like seven years now. Okay. You got your grid. Maybe you get more rows.
[2036.08 → 2040.08] Maybe you get folders. Maybe they're slightly larger icons.
[2040.08 → 2045.08] But basically you swipe left and right. You access the icons, and you press the thing and open the app.
[2045.08 → 2046.08] Yeah.
[2046.08 → 2051.08] For them to change something this fundamental, I would, okay, two, two, two ways of looking at this.
[2051.08 → 2059.08] Number one is I think they kind of have to allow people to use classic navigation or new navigation.
[2059.08 → 2064.08] Yeah. Why not? Themes are a thing. That's, that's one thing I really liked about this is just having options is going to be good.
[2064.08 → 2072.08] But number two is I think if Apple can validate internally that this is legitimately better and faster in every way,
[2072.08 → 2077.08] I hope that they have the Jones to just force everyone to switch to it because that's what Apple does.
[2077.08 → 2081.08] Because that's what Apple does. They figure out what's better for you, whether you like it or not.
[2081.08 → 2085.08] And they put it in front of you and make you use it. And that's how they innovate.
[2085.08 → 2092.08] One of the biggest reasons why I've never wanted iPhones though, is the fact that I don't think you can have a blank default screen.
[2092.08 → 2093.08] No, I don't think you can.
[2093.08 → 2095.08] Yeah. And I really like that.
[2095.08 → 2099.08] Yeah. There's, there's even stuff that you can't delete from the phone that comes straight from Apple.
[2099.08 → 2102.08] Like a lot of it and stuff that not everyone needs like book stand.
[2102.08 → 2108.08] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So like how I like using mine is I just go into the app view window every time.
[2108.08 → 2112.08] Essentially, I just press the app button at the bottom of Android and then that opens up my viewer.
[2112.08 → 2114.08] And then I use it kind of like an iPhone viewer.
[2114.08 → 2115.08] Right.
[2115.08 → 2117.08] Where you just flip pages and I know everything else.
[2117.08 → 2119.08] I used to do that. I've started being more of a home screen user.
[2119.08 → 2125.08] But I, I, I have some alternate screens that have things on them that aren't my home screen.
[2125.08 → 2128.08] So if I swipe left once or right once there's some there.
[2128.08 → 2134.08] Sure. I, I actually, unless I'm on an HTC device and I have Blink feed, so I'll keep that on the left.
[2134.08 → 2137.08] But then other than Blink feed, I go one home screen.
[2137.08 → 2138.08] Yeah.
[2138.08 → 2139.08] So that way it does a couple of things.
[2139.08 → 2142.08] Number one is it means that I'm never navigating between home screens.
[2142.08 → 2143.08] So I only use folders.
[2143.08 → 2146.08] And then I'll have quite large folders for all the main stuff that I do.
[2146.08 → 2147.08] Yeah.
[2147.08 → 2153.08] And then number two, it means that that whole Android behaviour or whenever you install a new app, it dumps it on one of your home screens.
[2153.08 → 2159.08] If you only have one home screen, and you delete all of your other ones, it just says it's full and then leaves it in the app tray.
[2159.08 → 2160.08] There you go.
[2160.08 → 2164.08] So I have to manually add something to my desktop if I actually want to have it.
[2164.08 → 2165.08] Yeah.
[2165.08 → 2166.08] So that's, that's why I do it that way.
[2166.08 → 2167.08] Yeah.
[2167.08 → 2172.08] Jared Rutkowski asks us not to make fun of Nicki Minaj. She's my BA.
[2172.08 → 2173.08] Okay, Jared.
[2173.08 → 2174.08] What does that mean?
[2174.08 → 2181.08] I think if he adds an E, then it means in some form of relationship, but I'm not super down with the kids lingo right now.
[2181.08 → 2182.08] So I might be wrong.
[2182.08 → 2183.08] The kids' lingo.
[2183.08 → 2184.08] You're like what, 23?
[2184.08 → 2185.08] BAE?
[2185.08 → 2186.08] BAE?
[2186.08 → 2187.08] I'm almost 24.
[2187.08 → 2188.08] I've had enough of your crap.
[2188.08 → 2189.08] Now people know how old I am.
[2189.08 → 2190.08] Alright, posted by-
[2190.08 → 2191.08] No one knew before.
[2191.08 → 2192.08] I'm sorry?
[2192.08 → 2193.08] No one knew how old I was before.
[2193.08 → 2194.08] They didn't?
[2194.08 → 2195.08] Oh.
[2195.08 → 2196.08] Well now they do.
[2196.08 → 2198.08] Okay, so posted originally by Benediction on the forum.
[2198.08 → 2200.08] This is freaking awesome.
[2200.08 → 2201.08] Benediction.
[2201.08 → 2202.08] I'm a them.
[2202.08 → 2212.08] Noble, the gentleman behind the last two land speed records in 1983 and 1997, is spearheading a project called Bloodhound SSC.
[2212.08 → 2216.08] It's been in the works for 30 years already.
[2216.08 → 2219.08] And we're not talking like speed of sound.
[2219.08 → 2222.08] You know, like that's wussy.
[2222.08 → 2225.08] That's like your dad's land speed record.
[2225.08 → 2229.08] We're talking a thousand miles an hour.
[2229.08 → 2232.08] And this article on Wired is fantastic.
[2232.08 → 2234.08] Here's the view inside the cockpit.
[2234.08 → 2235.08] I mean is that-
[2235.08 → 2236.08] So epic.
[2236.08 → 2240.08] Tesla could learn a thing or two about futuristic car design right there.
[2240.08 → 2242.08] Those also look fake as hell.
[2242.08 → 2243.08] No, no, this is not fake.
[2243.08 → 2244.08] This is it.
[2244.08 → 2248.08] Those look like they were pasted there in front of the cop.
[2248.08 → 2249.08] Look at this.
[2249.08 → 2256.08] Okay, so to augment the digital ones in case they fail, these are state-of-the-art Rolex analog meters.
[2256.08 → 2258.08] Yeah, yeah, yeah dog.
[2258.08 → 2259.08] That's so badass.
[2259.08 → 2264.08] So the brake pedal only works at 200 miles per hour or less.
[2264.08 → 2265.08] Yeah.
[2265.08 → 2272.08] And beyond that, there's like a complicated set of like air brakes and hydraulics and all that kind of crap to slow it down.
[2272.08 → 2274.08] And they have a pilot driving it.
[2274.08 → 2276.08] Yeah, so this is the pilot right here.
[2276.08 → 2282.08] His name's Andy Green and he was actually-he actually piloted, I think it was-
[2282.08 → 2285.08] The last one.
[2285.08 → 2289.08] I thought he's a- I think he flies planes as well.
[2289.08 → 2290.08] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2290.08 → 2291.08] He flies planes as well.
[2291.08 → 2297.08] And what's cool about, you know, sort of his involvement with the project is that the cockpit of the car-
[2297.08 → 2299.08] Can we even call it a car?
[2299.08 → 2300.08] I think it's sort of a car.
[2300.08 → 2301.08] The land rocket?
[2301.08 → 2302.08] The land rocket, sure.
[2302.08 → 2303.08] I don't know.
[2303.08 → 2307.08] The cockpit of the car is actually specially shaped to his body.
[2307.08 → 2308.08] Wow.
[2308.08 → 2310.08] So like, he's the guy who's going to drive it.
[2310.08 → 2311.08] That's it.
[2311.08 → 2312.08] That's all there is to it.
[2312.08 → 2314.08] Don't get fat in the next couple of months.
[2314.08 → 2315.08] Yeah.
[2315.08 → 2316.08] Years or whatever.
[2316.08 → 2321.08] Dude, do not put on some weight because you will compromise the whole project.
[2321.08 → 2322.08] The whole project, yeah.
[2322.08 → 2323.08] Yeah.
[2323.08 → 2328.08] So it's got a Rolls-Royce EJ200 jet engine taken out of a Eurofighter.
[2328.08 → 2329.08] Yes.
[2329.08 → 2339.08] We're talking 120 decibels of sound, most of which will be caused by shock waves, caused by the air running over the canopy of the cockpit and into the jet engine intake.
[2339.08 → 2344.08] And the shock waves, counter-intuitively, will slow down air as it passes over the car.
[2344.08 → 2350.08] And this is to ensure that the air does not hit the jet engine at a thousand miles per hour.
[2350.08 → 2357.08] In fact, one meter before the intake of the jet engine, it slows down to 600 miles per hour.
[2357.08 → 2358.08] Whoa.
[2358.08 → 2359.08] That's crazy.
[2359.08 → 2360.08] That's crazy.
[2360.08 → 2361.08] That's crazy.
[2361.08 → 2369.08] There's some stuff like the salt, I think it's the salt flats where they're driving it, or the flats that they're driving it on in general.
[2369.08 → 2370.08] This one's going to be in Africa.
[2370.08 → 2371.08] Yeah.
[2371.08 → 2372.08] I know.
[2372.08 → 2380.08] But they're laser etching the whole runway that they're going to be driving the thing on so that there will be nothing larger than a marble in the way.
[2380.08 → 2385.08] Because if he drove over something with the aluminum, like solid aluminum wheels...
[2385.08 → 2391.08] Yeah, I think they're going to be spinning with the same force required to separate DNA from cells.
[2391.08 → 2392.08] Yeah.
[2392.08 → 2394.08] And what were they, 200 pound aluminum wheels?
[2394.08 → 2396.08] Yeah, I think so.
[2396.08 → 2403.08] If he ran over something that large, it would feel like a bullet went through his entire body.
[2403.08 → 2407.08] Speaking of bullets going through his entire body, the cockpit is reinforced.
[2407.08 → 2411.08] So just in case, you know, a rocket, like this thing is armoured basically.
[2411.08 → 2412.08] Yeah.
[2412.08 → 2418.08] In case a rock goes flying or whatever else, it's not going to go in and kill him because, yeah, at that kind of speed, it would definitely...
[2418.08 → 2419.08] You're done.
[2419.08 → 2420.08] You would be done.
[2420.08 → 2421.08] Yeah.
[2421.08 → 2422.08] Pretty exciting.
[2422.08 → 2428.08] To put a thousand miles per hour in perspective, this actually, this was what drove it home for me.
[2428.08 → 2434.08] That is the length of three football pitches per second.
[2434.08 → 2438.08] It's 400 and something meters per second.
[2438.08 → 2446.08] So, um, a football pitch is, I believe, a little longer than an American football field, which is 100 yards.
[2446.08 → 2452.08] So, I'm sure someone's going to destroy me in the comments for not knowing how long the football pitch is.
[2452.08 → 2453.08] But, whatever.
[2453.08 → 2457.08] The point is, three football pitches per second.
[2457.08 → 2458.08] Unreal.
[2458.08 → 2461.08] I think someone, someone in the comments must have figured it out.
[2461.08 → 2462.08] Someone probably did.
[2462.08 → 2463.08] On my objectives.
[2463.08 → 2466.08] Someone will have converted it to meters per second.
[2466.08 → 2467.08] It's going to be here.
[2467.08 → 2468.08] Come on.
[2468.08 → 2469.08] Oh!
[2469.08 → 2470.08] 447!
[2470.08 → 2472.08] 447 meters per second?
[2472.08 → 2473.08] Apparently, yeah.
[2473.08 → 2474.08] Or 1600 kilometres.
[2474.08 → 2475.08] There you go.
[2475.08 → 2477.08] So, so, 447 meters per second.
[2477.08 → 2478.08] Unreal.
[2478.08 → 2479.08] Alright.
[2479.08 → 2480.08] That's incredibly fast.
[2480.08 → 2481.08] Oh, yeah.
[2481.08 → 2487.08] I never, I think we never said the name of the, uh, so the vehicle is called the Bloodhound SSC.
[2487.08 → 2488.08] Epic.
[2488.08 → 2489.08] Alright.
[2489.08 → 2495.08] So, let's talk about some other high performance stuff here that's totally back to, back to actual
[2495.08 → 2496.08] computers.
[2496.08 → 2498.08] People were laughing at you because you said football pitch.
[2498.08 → 2499.08] Why?
[2499.08 → 2500.08] That's what they're called.
[2500.08 → 2501.08] I know.
[2501.08 → 2503.08] I'm not going to call it soccer.
[2503.08 → 2506.08] It's not called soccer.
[2506.08 → 2507.08] Uh.
[2507.08 → 2511.08] One small fraction of the world calls it soccer.
[2511.08 → 2512.08] Yes, that's true.
[2512.08 → 2513.08] That's it.
[2513.08 → 2514.08] But the origins weren't from the states.
[2514.08 → 2519.08] And, the name of football is stupid here in the states because you do not play-
[2519.08 → 2522.08] You used your foot a lot more when it was first started.
[2522.08 → 2523.08] Right.
[2523.08 → 2524.08] So what?
[2524.08 → 2527.08] When they, when they, when they invented the game, you used your foot a lot more.
[2527.08 → 2528.08] Right.
[2528.08 → 2529.08] So then change the name.
[2529.08 → 2536.08] I mean, if, if, if baseball, if they removed the bases, are they still, if they removed the
[2536.08 → 2537.08] base of the ball.
[2537.08 → 2538.08] Just call it ball.
[2538.08 → 2539.08] Yeah.
[2539.08 → 2540.08] Just call it ball.
[2540.08 → 2541.08] I mean, they do kind of.
[2541.08 → 2542.08] Play ball!
[2542.08 → 2543.08] It's implied.
[2543.08 → 2544.08] That's true.
[2544.08 → 2545.08] That's true.
[2545.08 → 2546.08] Fat ball.
[2546.08 → 2547.08] If basketball.
[2547.08 → 2548.08] If they take away the baskets.
[2548.08 → 2549.08] Ring ball.
[2549.08 → 2550.08] Ring ball.
[2550.08 → 2551.08] You can't keep calling it basketball.
[2551.08 → 2552.08] You are.
[2552.08 → 2553.08] Yeah, I know.
[2553.08 → 2554.08] You can't call American and, so.
[2554.08 → 2555.08] Soccer came from association though.
[2555.08 → 2556.08] It's not even an American thing.
[2556.08 → 2558.08] I believe it's from Oxford or something.
[2558.08 → 2559.08] Something like that.
[2559.08 → 2560.08] Either way.
[2560.08 → 2561.08] The sport is not called soccer.
[2561.08 → 2563.08] I refuse to call it soccer.
[2563.08 → 2567.08] It is called football and football in North America is called American football.
[2567.08 → 2569.08] So that's it.
[2569.08 → 2574.08] That's how I'm going to do it and you guys can all deal with it because I am the caped
[2574.08 → 2575.08] badass.
[2575.08 → 2581.08] I really feel like you need to have like a bandana over your face.
[2581.08 → 2582.08] This thing really smells.
[2582.08 → 2583.08] So you don't have to keep it like this.
[2583.08 → 2584.08] It's been in my attic.
[2584.08 → 2585.08] It just, yeah, it just smells like old.
[2585.08 → 2586.08] Forever.
[2586.08 → 2587.08] Yeah.
[2587.08 → 2591.08] Alright, so let's move on to this topic posted by Rock with original articles from TheVerge.com
[2591.08 → 2593.08] and Gadget and Digital Trends.
[2593.08 → 2597.08] I'm mad at The Verge right now though so we're not bringing up their article.
[2597.08 → 2598.08] Why are you?
[2598.08 → 2601.08] There is a really stupid piece on The Verge right now about Gamer gate.
[2601.08 → 2603.08] Like just phenomenally stupid.
[2603.08 → 2604.08] Ugh.
[2604.08 → 2605.08] Ugh.
[2605.08 → 2608.08] Like the dumbest thing I've read since that.
[2608.08 → 2610.08] Don't do that.
[2610.08 → 2611.08] Edgy.
[2611.08 → 2613.08] Come on.
[2613.08 → 2615.08] It's a freaking, it's this.
[2615.08 → 2616.08] I know.
[2616.08 → 2617.08] Anyway.
[2617.08 → 2618.08] I'm a duck.
[2618.08 → 2627.08] Yeah, it's the dumbest thing I've read since that critique of Shadow of Mordor where you
[2627.08 → 2629.08] learn the sneak attack tactic by kissing your life.
[2629.08 → 2630.08] Oh no.
[2630.08 → 2631.08] That was so dumb.
[2631.08 → 2632.08] I don't remember who did that.
[2632.08 → 2634.08] I didn't say it was dumber than that.
[2634.08 → 2637.08] I said it was the dumbest thing I've read since then.
[2637.08 → 2638.08] Since then, okay.
[2638.08 → 2639.08] Okay.
[2639.08 → 2645.08] Alright, so here's the article on DigitalTrends.com, and they have a hand on of the Alienware graphics
[2645.08 → 2646.08] amplifier.
[2646.08 → 2650.08] Turbo charge your laptop with a desktop GPU.
[2650.08 → 2652.08] Alienware now makes a box for that.
[2652.08 → 2657.08] So basically what this does is it connects via an unfortunately proprietary cable.
[2657.08 → 2658.08] Yup.
[2658.08 → 2660.08] So it only works with Alienware laptops.
[2660.08 → 2662.08] Only works with select Alienware laptops.
[2662.08 → 2663.08] Yeah.
[2663.08 → 2664.08] Even then.
[2664.08 → 2665.08] Which is sort of a bummer.
[2665.08 → 2668.08] But basically it's a power supply and a PCI Express slot inside.
[2668.08 → 2669.08] Let's see if they've, yup, there we go.
[2669.08 → 2676.08] So it's a power supply and a PCI Express slot inside that allows you to basically have external
[2676.08 → 2680.08] PCI Express and plug it into your laptop.
[2680.08 → 2685.08] I think the only models it works with right now are ones that probably don't even really
[2685.08 → 2687.08] need an external graphics card for the moment.
[2687.08 → 2693.08] But if you want to be able to upgrade in the future, then, oh, hold on, here we go.
[2693.08 → 2699.08] The Alienware 13 will only ship with GeForce GTX 860M graphics.
[2699.08 → 2703.08] It's disappointing that the blah blah blah, but that does give you more of a reason to
[2703.08 → 2705.08] upgrade to the whatever the thing.
[2705.08 → 2706.08] Okay.
[2706.08 → 2707.08] Blah blah blah.
[2707.08 → 2708.08] Something.
[2708.08 → 2709.08] Something.
[2709.08 → 2710.08] Whatever the thing.
[2710.08 → 2711.08] Super helpful information on the stream.
[2711.08 → 2712.08] Blah blah blah.
[2712.08 → 2716.08] Yeah, there's actually not a lot of info about it here, and I didn't do much reading about
[2716.08 → 2717.08] this.
[2717.08 → 2718.08] I'd be interested to see.
[2718.08 → 2720.08] It's going to be hard to...
[2720.08 → 2725.08] I wonder if you could spend awhile and find clock speeds for a mobile GPU and a desktop
[2725.08 → 2731.08] GPU that would be comparable in terms of performance and then test what frame rates you can get having
[2731.08 → 2734.08] a GPU and a desktop machine and the GPU and a laptop machine.
[2734.08 → 2738.08] Like you mean like benchmarking mobile CPUs that way?
[2738.08 → 2743.08] Like try to benchmark a mobile CPU and then clock back your desktop CPU to try and find
[2743.08 → 2744.08] an equivalency.
[2744.08 → 2749.08] And then once you've found a CPU level equivalency, then bench the graphics card on each one and
[2749.08 → 2750.08] see what the performance difference is.
[2750.08 → 2754.08] You can play around with it a fair bit but the issue that I ran into when I was doing
[2754.08 → 2761.08] my 980 versus 980m video not that long ago was that even though motherboards do let
[2761.08 → 2766.08] you play around with your CPU multiplier a fair bit, many of them don't let you turn it down.
[2766.08 → 2768.08] No, turn down the desktop one.
[2768.08 → 2770.08] Yeah, they don't let you turn it down enough.
[2770.08 → 2771.08] Oh, enough.
[2771.08 → 2772.08] Yeah.
[2772.08 → 2775.08] So you can turn it down a little bit, but you can't turn it down enough to be equivalent
[2775.08 → 2777.08] to a same architecture mobile CPU.
[2777.08 → 2780.08] Yeah, we'd have to get a much older architecture one I guess.
[2780.08 → 2783.08] And so, and once you're doing that it becomes an apples to oranges comparison.
[2783.08 → 2784.08] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[2784.08 → 2786.08] So that was the challenge that I ran into.
[2786.08 → 2792.08] Supports any GPU up to 375 watts and works for now only with the Alienware 13.
[2792.08 → 2797.08] So that one does have a 860m so hopefully I guess that gives people a compelling reason
[2797.08 → 2799.08] to buy one of these.
[2799.08 → 2800.08] It costs 300 bucks though.
[2800.08 → 2805.08] So you'll pay, you have to buy a new laptop, you have to buy a graphics card, and you have
[2805.08 → 2807.08] to buy 300 bucks for the privilege of using the box with it.
[2807.08 → 2812.08] And consider, yeah, considering how much, like how long those boxes have existed in various
[2812.08 → 2817.08] forms and how much is really going into that box, it's pretty expensive.
[2817.08 → 2820.08] I mean this standard makes no sense until it runs on Thunderbolt.
[2820.08 → 2822.08] So, yeah.
[2822.08 → 2823.08] And it will at some point.
[2823.08 → 2826.08] We will get Thunderbolt boxes that allow external GPUs.
[2826.08 → 2831.08] In fact, the only reason they don't work now is that AMD and Nvidia haven't enabled it.
[2831.08 → 2838.08] So all Alienware's done here is they've exposed a direct PCI Express link through a proprietary
[2838.08 → 2842.08] cable so that the GPU can't tell that it's, you know, in an external box.
[2842.08 → 2843.08] That's all they've done.
[2843.08 → 2846.08] There's no reason that Thunderbolt's bandwidth couldn't support external GPUs.
[2846.08 → 2849.08] And Windows is just like, sure, whatever, cool.
[2849.08 → 2850.08] Yeah.
[2850.08 → 2852.08] So they're just kind of hiding it from everybody.
[2852.08 → 2853.08] Yeah.
[2853.08 → 2854.08] Alright.
[2854.08 → 2857.08] Now I love, I love mechanical keyboards.
[2857.08 → 2858.08] I love Cherry, but this is ridiculous.
[2858.08 → 2860.08] But I still don't think this makes a ton of sense.
[2860.08 → 2861.08] This is nuts.
[2861.08 → 2865.08] Originally posted by Nagy on the forum, I'll pull up the original article here.
[2865.08 → 2869.08] The most edentulous looking laptop in a long time.
[2869.08 → 2870.08] I can't say ever.
[2870.08 → 2872.08] Because there's some old school ones that look absolutely hilarious.
[2872.08 → 2873.08] Pretty stupid.
[2873.08 → 2876.08] But like, what?
[2876.08 → 2882.08] I'm going to let that sink in for a moment.
[2882.08 → 2888.08] So you know how, I've talked about this in the past, how the way that technology is miniaturizing
[2888.08 → 2895.08] and power consumption and heat output are going down, not only enables smaller devices,
[2895.08 → 2901.08] but also devices that are the same size where we pack all that hardware into a small part
[2901.08 → 2905.08] of it and build in additional functionality, bigger batteries, or whatever else the case
[2905.08 → 2906.08] may be.
[2906.08 → 2907.08] This is not what I had in mind.
[2907.08 → 2908.08] No.
[2908.08 → 2911.08] So, you want to cover this one?
[2911.08 → 2912.08] What is this thing?
[2912.08 → 2918.08] I don't even, okay, so it's all the main components for the laptop go into that super
[2918.08 → 2923.08] uninteresting looking, other than the dragon, I guess, but like kind of useless area above
[2923.08 → 2924.08] the keyboard.
[2924.08 → 2929.08] I have to say this, if they have to have a brushed aluminum panel, then it's better to have
[2929.08 → 2933.08] it's better to have it above the palm rest rather than as the palm rest.
[2933.08 → 2936.08] Definitely, they get points for that, and that dragon looks pretty cool.
[2936.08 → 2940.08] But still, that's a huge blank area which is essentially unusable.
[2940.08 → 2946.08] I like that they even move the buttons closer to the keyboard, so like the power button is
[2946.08 → 2948.08] closer to the keyboard, not at the top.
[2948.08 → 2951.08] So again, with the brushed aluminum thing, you're probably not going to be dragging your fingers
[2951.08 → 2952.08] over it very often.
[2952.08 → 2956.08] But essentially, the keyboard area is just blank space because the switches and everything
[2956.08 → 2960.08] are so tall, and you need the electrical base for the keyboard under that as well.
[2960.08 → 2963.08] So that whole area is just the keyboard.
[2963.08 → 2966.08] And then above that is where the whole rest of your laptop goes.
[2966.08 → 2969.08] And for those of you wondering, well, hold on a second, where's the touchpad?
[2969.08 → 2970.08] Ah, yes.
[2970.08 → 2973.08] MSI does have that taken care of.
[2973.08 → 2976.08] They have a touchpad over here on the right.
[2976.08 → 2977.08] Yeah.
[2977.08 → 2981.08] That it also serves as a number pad if you want to put it in some...
[2981.08 → 2984.08] So that's going to be a super weird place to have a touchpad.
[2984.08 → 2985.08] Yeah.
[2985.08 → 2986.08] I mean, it didn't work for the Racer Blade.
[2986.08 → 2987.08] Nope.
[2987.08 → 2989.08] It's not gonna work for this.
[2989.08 → 2992.08] Touchpad on the right is a bad idea.
[2992.08 → 2997.08] Because especially if you use your touchpad two-handed, like a lot of people do, one hand
[2997.08 → 2999.08] for movement, one hand for clicking.
[2999.08 → 3000.08] Hold on.
[3000.08 → 3005.08] Having it over on the right like that is actually pretty darn inconvenient.
[3005.08 → 3006.08] Sup?
[3006.08 → 3007.08] Sorry, don't worry about it.
[3007.08 → 3008.08] Okay.
[3008.08 → 3009.08] I'll talk about it later.
[3009.08 → 3010.08] Cool.
[3010.08 → 3012.08] Yeah, it's just silly.
[3012.08 → 3015.08] And, like, just leave...
[3015.08 → 3017.08] I like the mechanical keyboards in there.
[3017.08 → 3021.08] It's not a good way to implement it, and I don't think there is a good way to implement it.
[3021.08 → 3025.08] I would rather it was just a good laptop and I could just take one with me.
[3025.08 → 3027.08] I'll just take a ten keyless with me.
[3027.08 → 3028.08] Okay, hold on a second.
[3028.08 → 3029.08] That'd be fine.
[3029.08 → 3030.08] Let's see if we can...
[3030.08 → 3034.08] Okay, would you prefer this design if the mechanical keyboard was in the more traditional
[3034.08 → 3037.08] keyboard location at the top of the laptop?
[3037.08 → 3038.08] No.
[3038.08 → 3039.08] I think I would.
[3039.08 → 3040.08] Why?
[3040.08 → 3041.08] Because if they could...
[3041.08 → 3043.08] And you just have this giant blank space under it.
[3043.08 → 3044.08] No, no, because...
[3044.08 → 3045.08] Okay, okay, okay, hold on a second.
[3045.08 → 3046.08] No, I still don't...
[3046.08 → 3048.08] Okay, so here, here, here.
[3048.08 → 3050.08] Here's a more traditional laptop.
[3050.08 → 3060.08] If they could put the mechanical keyboard here, and then they used all this space for internals,
[3060.08 → 3066.08] and they could keep the touchpad here, would you tolerate kind of an empty space here with
[3066.08 → 3069.08] a mechanical keyboard and all the guts here and then just...
[3069.08 → 3073.08] I mean, basically all you would need is small PCBs down the sides for I.O.
[3073.08 → 3074.08] So nothing really changed.
[3074.08 → 3076.08] And then you would need wiring up to the screen.
[3076.08 → 3078.08] Like, would that have been a better way to do it?
[3078.08 → 3079.08] Well, nothing really changed in that aspect.
[3079.08 → 3080.08] Yeah.
[3080.08 → 3083.08] Other than that there's a mechanical keyboard in it with the added weight and added thickness
[3083.08 → 3085.08] that does come with the territory.
[3085.08 → 3088.08] I worry if there's maybe other issues with that.
[3090.08 → 3092.08] I don't really know what they could be.
[3092.08 → 3094.08] Like that it's just dumb overall or...
[3094.08 → 3095.08] Maybe, I don't know.
[3095.08 → 3097.08] I don't actually make laptops.
[3097.08 → 3099.08] I don't feel like it should be that big of an issue.
[3099.08 → 3100.08] Really? Tell me more.
[3100.08 → 3103.08] You know, I tried to make a laptop last time.
[3103.08 → 3104.08] I tried to make a laptop last time.
[3104.08 → 3105.08] It was a Friday.
[3105.08 → 3107.08] It was raining outside.
[3107.08 → 3108.08] No, um...
[3108.08 → 3110.08] I was like, well, if Apple can do it then...
[3110.08 → 3111.08] That's probably fine.
[3111.08 → 3113.08] It's probably not that hard.
[3113.08 → 3115.08] I'm chained, it's alright.
[3115.08 → 3116.08] Um...
[3116.08 → 3118.08] Yeah, I don't know.
[3118.08 → 3119.08] It should be fine.
[3119.08 → 3121.08] I would have definitely preferred they did it that way.
[3121.08 → 3124.08] The first thing I thought of when I saw this was why is the keyboard there?
[3124.08 → 3126.08] That makes no sense.
[3126.08 → 3129.08] And then like, space for hardware and cooling.
[3129.08 → 3130.08] Um...
[3130.08 → 3131.08] But yeah, just move...
[3131.08 → 3132.08] And like, I get it.
[3132.08 → 3133.08] It's probably back exhaust.
[3133.08 → 3134.08] Whoop!
[3134.08 → 3135.08] Yep, rear exhaust.
[3135.08 → 3140.08] So having the keyboard in the way of that, you'd have to have like, side exhaust.
[3140.08 → 3141.08] Right.
[3141.08 → 3142.08] Which could get in the way of I.O.
[3142.08 → 3146.08] But then, I don't think anyone's really complained that much about having I.O. in the back of the laptop.
[3146.08 → 3147.08] Yeah.
[3147.08 → 3148.08] I don't mind that.
[3148.08 → 3149.08] Yeah, that's a good point.
[3149.08 → 3150.08] Rear I.O.
[3150.08 → 3151.08] I would be probably okay with that.
[3151.08 → 3156.08] Maybe if you had like, a few on the side that the keyboard is on, not the blank side that you were talking about.
[3156.08 → 3157.08] Yeah.
[3157.08 → 3160.08] You could have a couple, like maybe one or two USB ports and that's it.
[3160.08 → 3161.08] Yeah.
[3161.08 → 3162.08] So you don't have to run a ton of stuff there.
[3162.08 → 3165.08] Um, and then have your I.O. at the back and then exhaust at the sides.
[3165.08 → 3166.08] That's probably fine.
[3166.08 → 3167.08] I've got...
[3167.08 → 3170.08] You know, I used to use the side exhaust on my bamboo to heat things up.
[3170.08 → 3175.08] I've got, uh, I'm just changing the text.
[3175.08 → 3182.08] I've got people in the Twitch chat pointing out that if the entire, um, heat, if the heat
[3182.08 → 3185.08] generating components of a laptop, bearing in mind that this is a gaming machine, so we've
[3185.08 → 3186.08] got a powerful GPU in there.
[3186.08 → 3187.08] Oh, so it would be under your hands.
[3187.08 → 3189.08] It would be right under your touchpad.
[3189.08 → 3195.08] However, what I will point out is that ASUS seems to have that problem kicked.
[3195.08 → 3204.08] Because on their, um, on their 750 series and their 751, both the bottom and the top
[3204.08 → 3206.08] of the laptop are cool enough for use.
[3206.08 → 3210.08] Yeah, but again, this is, this is the thickest part of the laptop is at the back.
[3210.08 → 3211.08] Yes.
[3211.08 → 3212.08] Which is the best way to do it.
[3212.08 → 3213.08] The booty.
[3213.08 → 3215.08] And then they have big heat sinks here and exhaust fans.
[3215.08 → 3216.08] The best way to do it?
[3216.08 → 3217.08] Yeah, man.
[3217.08 → 3218.08] At the back is the back.
[3218.08 → 3219.08] Okay, you know what?
[3219.08 → 3220.08] I think we should move on.
[3220.08 → 3223.08] So, our next topic here is the Motorola Droid Turbo.
[3223.08 → 3226.08] Basically, sorry, I'm going to keep going for a sec.
[3226.08 → 3230.08] Basically, having your heat sinks at the front would drastically decrease how big they are.
[3230.08 → 3231.08] Yeah, how big they can be.
[3231.08 → 3233.08] Which would actually be an issue.
[3233.08 → 3239.08] Unless we, unless we went with like the classic, like brick style laptop with no natural, you
[3239.08 → 3241.08] know, angle, angled design to it.
[3241.08 → 3243.08] You could, you could use the rubber feet on the bottom.
[3243.08 → 3246.08] Just rectangular prism style.
[3246.08 → 3247.08] Yeah.
[3247.08 → 3248.08] Yeah.
[3248.08 → 3249.08] Alright.
[3249.08 → 3253.08] Moving on to the Motorola Droid Turbo.
[3253.08 → 3258.08] Is it the phone that I was asking for a mere two weeks ago with two day battery life?
[3258.08 → 3260.08] They claim it is.
[3260.08 → 3264.08] We're talking up to 48 hours battery life, eight hours of charge in 15 minutes with that
[3264.08 → 3266.08] new quick charging technology.
[3266.08 → 3269.08] Can't remember what it's called at the moment, but we're going to do it as fast as possible on
[3269.08 → 3270.08] later.
[3270.08 → 3271.08] Then I'll hopefully remember.
[3271.08 → 3277.08] Got a 21 megapixel camera if you shoot in 4x3 or 15.5 megapixels if you shoot in 16x9,
[3277.08 → 3282.08] but pro tip for those of you out there who want to take the best possible pictures, just
[3282.08 → 3285.08] take a square picture and crop it later.
[3285.08 → 3286.08] Yeah.
[3286.08 → 3287.08] Yeah.
[3287.08 → 3288.08] Yeah.
[3288.08 → 3294.08] F 2.0 aperture, so that's a very wide open aperture.
[3294.08 → 3299.08] It shoots 4k, 24fps video, 1080p, 30fps, and 720p slo-mo.
[3299.08 → 3309.08] It's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor with 2.7 gigahertz quad-core and an Arena 420 GPU.
[3309.08 → 3312.08] You might say it has high performance.
[3312.08 → 3314.08] Oh my god.
[3314.08 → 3325.08] 3 gigs of RAM, 5.2 inch, 5.2 inch, 1440p, AMOLED screen, 13900 William hour battery,
[3325.08 → 3328.08] water-resistant NFC, 32 gig and 64 gig models.
[3328.08 → 3333.08] The back is made of fine woven materials and mono front ported speakers.
[3333.08 → 3336.08] So I don't like the mono, do like the front port.
[3336.08 → 3337.08] Yeah.
[3337.08 → 3338.08] I don't think anyone likes the mono.
[3338.08 → 3339.08] No.
[3339.08 → 3341.08] No, it makes you real sick.
[3341.08 → 3344.08] Unfortunately, sorry go ahead.
[3344.08 → 3345.08] No, keep going.
[3345.08 → 3349.08] Oh, this was posted by McMad358 on the forum by the way, thank you for posting.
[3349.08 → 3355.08] And there are articles from everywhere in the entire internet, so why don't we just pull up droidlife.com.
[3355.08 → 3370.08] Unfortunately, some of the reports of the droid turbo's real world battery life are not well aligned with the 48-hour battery life claim.
[3370.08 → 3371.08] Ooh.
[3371.08 → 3373.08] That's super disappointing.
[3373.08 → 3375.08] I actually didn't read that part.
[3375.08 → 3379.08] I really like their web view thing.
[3379.08 → 3382.08] You can directly compare it against other phones, which is pretty cool.
[3382.08 → 3383.08] I don't remember.
[3383.08 → 3386.08] I think that was on Motorola's actual website.
[3386.08 → 3393.08] You could pair up other phones to compare it against, and then it had a direct compare thing, which is actually really helpful.
[3393.08 → 3398.08] One thing I'm not impressed with is they ditched the ring flash, which they've been doing recently.
[3398.08 → 3400.08] I don't know why they did that.
[3400.08 → 3402.08] Why bother?
[3402.08 → 3404.08] I don't get it.
[3404.08 → 3406.08] Yeah, there's a lot of buzz around it.
[3406.08 → 3411.08] I've requested a review unit, but Motorola mostly ignores me these days, so I don't know.
[3411.08 → 3412.08] We'll see.
[3412.08 → 3413.08] Maybe we'll cover it.
[3413.08 → 3414.08] Maybe we won't.
[3414.08 → 3415.08] Yeah.
[3415.08 → 3418.08] Hopefully that 48 hour thing is actually true.
[3418.08 → 3428.08] Yeah, I mean, I still think that the thing about Android is that if it gets bogged down enough, you could have a 6,000 William hour battery, and you could still find a way to drain it in eight hours.
[3428.08 → 3429.08] That's true.
[3429.08 → 3431.08] That's the problem with Android.
[3431.08 → 3432.08] That's true.
[3432.08 → 3437.08] I've got a buddy that runs a lot of widgets and stuff on his Note, what is that, Note 4?
[3437.08 → 3438.08] Yeah.
[3438.08 → 3441.08] And almost maxes out his RAM capacity idling.
[3441.08 → 3442.08] Right.
[3442.08 → 3445.08] So like, people can do that for sure.
[3445.08 → 3447.08] And he's not even doing a ton.
[3447.08 → 3449.08] Like, it doesn't seem too ridiculous on his phone.
[3449.08 → 3454.08] And he's using that much of his RAM automatically, which is pretty intense.
[3454.08 → 3457.08] Okay, so hold on a second.
[3457.08 → 3460.08] I actually need this.
[3460.08 → 3461.08] Okay.
[3461.08 → 3464.08] Just a second.
[3464.08 → 3470.08] So I think it might be time for our sponsor time.
[3470.08 → 3474.08] So our first sponsor today is 5-4 Clothing.
[3474.08 → 3478.08] I'm going to go ahead and actually see if I can get everything right.
[3478.08 → 3481.08] I had it, I made it Nick's job.
[3481.08 → 3482.08] You should see how wrong you can get it.
[3482.08 → 3484.08] I should see how wrong I can get it?
[3484.08 → 3485.08] Yeah.
[3485.08 → 3486.08] It doesn't seem to matter.
[3486.08 → 3488.08] Also, oh, did you add a Dollar Shave Club lower third anywhere?
[3488.08 → 3490.08] Yeah, I think it's under that one.
[3490.08 → 3491.08] It's under that one?
[3491.08 → 3492.08] Okay.
[3492.08 → 3493.08] Pretty sure.
[3493.08 → 3499.08] 5-4 Club, use offer code Linus2 to get an extra item in your first package.
[3499.08 → 3500.08] Oh, good.
[3500.08 → 3503.08] So this is actually the same offer that we had before.
[3503.08 → 3505.08] So actually, it's not that hard.
[3505.08 → 3513.08] So the way 5–4 works is for $60 a month, and you can head over to, um, excuse me.
[3513.08 → 3515.08] You can head over to their website.
[3515.08 → 3517.08] Let's go ahead and just, yay, there we go.
[3517.08 → 3519.08] Okay, I've got a picture of the free item that you get.
[3519.08 → 3524.08] So the way it works is for $60 a month, they have one of their, I'm going to make up the
[3524.08 → 3528.08] name for them because I never get anything right for 5-4 anyway, so I might as well just
[3528.08 → 3529.08] make things up as I go along.
[3529.08 → 3532.08] Fashion, they have one of their fashion artisans.
[3532.08 → 3533.08] Sure.
[3533.08 → 3534.08] Sure, yeah.
[3534.08 → 3539.08] Pick out clothes for you based on a short survey that takes just a couple of minutes to
[3539.08 → 3544.08] fill out where you tell them, uh, some clothing that you like, you tell them your size,
[3544.08 → 3548.08] you tell them some shoes that you like, you tell them sort of some stuff about you, and
[3548.08 → 3552.08] they go ahead, and they pick up stuff that they think you're going to like, they send
[3552.08 → 3558.08] it to you, and you pay half of what the sticker price would be on their website.
[3558.08 → 3562.08] So you can actually check it out over at 5-4clothing.com.
[3562.08 → 3568.08] They've actually got a surprising number of, like, photos of, like, A-list celebrities and
[3568.08 → 3569.08] stuff who wear 5-4.
[3569.08 → 3570.08] Yeah.
[3570.08 → 3575.08] Because the whole idea behind it is that instead of going to the store and feeling like you're
[3575.08 → 3582.08] being judged by all the sales associates because you don't know what you're doing,
[3582.08 → 3587.08] the idea is that you should be able to look nice and be well-dressed without worrying about
[3587.08 → 3593.08] any of that stuff and without ever actually leaving your home in your pajamas, which is
[3593.08 → 3597.08] what you'll have to do the first time if you ever want to actually update your wardrobe.
[3597.08 → 3598.08] Or every time.
[3598.08 → 3602.08] So, the special offer with offer code Linus2 is to get that shirt that I showed you guys
[3602.08 → 3608.08] before, free, in your first package, along with your new subscription.
[3608.08 → 3610.08] So let's go ahead and show that again.
[3610.08 → 3611.08] Yay!
[3611.08 → 3612.08] Look at it!
[3612.08 → 3613.08] I should get one of these.
[3613.08 → 3615.08] Actually, I'm wearing a 5-4 shirt right now.
[3615.08 → 3616.08] There you go.
[3616.08 → 3617.08] Look at that.
[3617.08 → 3618.08] I quite like this one.
[3618.08 → 3623.08] So, it's- not all of their stuff is like 5–4 logos all over the place either.
[3623.08 → 3625.08] In fact, kind of funny story.
[3625.08 → 3629.08] You know that shirt that I wear in my Fastest Possible videos?
[3629.08 → 3631.08] Everyone thinks it's Faze Clan?
[3631.08 → 3632.08] No?
[3632.08 → 3633.08] Yeah!
[3633.08 → 3634.08] Everyone thinks it's Faze Clan.
[3634.08 → 3636.08] No, it's a 5-4 shirt.
[3636.08 → 3640.08] Everyone's like- it's amazing how many comments I get on that shirt.
[3640.08 → 3643.08] No, when I wear my 5-4 shirt, everyone says I'm Faze Clan.
[3643.08 → 3644.08] Yeah.
[3644.08 → 3645.08] Yeah.
[3645.08 → 3646.08] No, no.
[3646.08 → 3647.08] Not Faze Clan shirts.
[3647.08 → 3648.08] Yeah.
[3648.08 → 3649.08] Not Faze Clan shirts.
[3649.08 → 3650.08] Alright, which brings us-
[3650.08 → 3652.08] We have no affiliates with Faze Clan.
[3652.08 → 3654.08] That would be cool, but no.
[3654.08 → 3657.08] Which brings us to our second sponsor today!
[3657.08 → 3658.08] Dollar Shave Club.
[3658.08 → 3664.50] Yet another service that's all about not looking like a hobo without actually having to leave
[3664.50 → 3668.70] your house looking like a hobo while you shop for the supplies to not make you look like
[3668.70 → 3669.70] a hobo.
[3669.70 → 3672.20] So, Dollar Shave Club is another subscription based service.
[3672.20 → 3675.80] This time, it's all about bathroom supplies.
[3675.80 → 3681.62] So you can get their high quality razors, their Dr. Carver's Shave Butter, their One Wipe
[3681.62 → 3686.40] Charlie's, peppermint scented butt wipes for men, and you can actually get travel sizes
[3686.40 → 3688.40] of the One Wipe Charlie's.
[3688.40 → 3689.40] Can you?
[3689.40 → 3691.40] Yeah, one time use packages.
[3691.40 → 3693.40] Remember, none of them are reusable though.
[3693.40 → 3697.40] I wonder if that would help in countries where you have to buy toilet paper anyway?
[3697.40 → 3698.40] Yeah, just carrying around.
[3698.40 → 3701.48] When you have to go to the washroom you have to buy toilet paper or whatever, right?
[3701.48 → 3702.80] I think there are countries like that.
[3702.80 → 3705.40] Then yeah, they just carry One Wipe Charlie's around with you.
[3705.40 → 3710.72] So anyway, the point is to make your butt smell like peppermint.
[3710.72 → 3711.72] No wait, that isn't the point.
[3711.72 → 3712.72] What am I even talking about again?
[3712.72 → 3719.22] I always find some way for like, apparently females use it more now, and like now it's
[3719.22 → 3722.22] a travelling companion to countries where you have to buy toilet paper.
[3722.22 → 3725.90] Man, I should be a marketing person for Dollar Shave Club.
[3725.90 → 3726.90] For Dollar Shave Club?
[3726.90 → 3731.44] Alright, so speaking of marketing things for Dollar Shave Club, today we are going to be
[3731.44 → 3738.76] doing a live test of a Dollar Shave Club razor versus a complete-wow, this is the most generic
[3738.76 → 3739.76] razor ever.
[3739.76 → 3740.76] A shaving benchmark?
[3740.76 → 3741.76] Yeah, a shaving benchmark.
[3741.76 → 3747.76] So I actually had New Nick provide me with actually his personal razor, which he assures
[3747.76 → 3750.08] me as not his balls razor.
[3750.08 → 3753.08] Because I am planning to put it on my face.
[3753.08 → 3754.08] So, okay.
[3754.08 → 3755.08] What?
[3755.08 → 3758.08] This is why you need this service, because you won't even go to the store to buy your own.
[3758.08 → 3760.08] You have to use another employee's.
[3760.08 → 3763.08] I know, that's because Dollar Shave Club, man.
[3763.08 → 3765.08] I'm not going to go buy razors.
[3765.08 → 3766.08] That's stupid.
[3766.08 → 3773.08] I mean, okay, it's cheaper, and it takes less time.
[3773.08 → 3774.96] That's the whole idea behind it.
[3774.96 → 3775.96] I know, it's just funny.
[3775.96 → 3776.96] The only-
[3776.96 → 3779.40] You needed a sample one, but you wouldn't even-
[3779.40 → 3781.44] Okay, tell me this.
[3781.44 → 3784.84] Why weren't you able to give me a non-Dollar Shave Club razor to try?
[3784.84 → 3786.84] Well, now I use the Dollar Shave Club one.
[3786.84 → 3787.84] Okay.
[3787.84 → 3788.84] We've all seen my old ones.
[3788.84 → 3789.84] My bad?
[3789.84 → 3790.84] Yeah, I know.
[3790.84 → 3791.84] Your old ones were terrible.
[3791.84 → 3792.84] You shouldn't use those.
[3792.84 → 3795.84] Alright, so half of the face with Dollar Shave Club, half of the face with Dollar Shave Club,
[3795.84 → 3796.84] the generic razor.
[3796.84 → 3801.52] We're going to start with the generic one just to see what kind of results we get out
[3801.52 → 3802.52] of it.
[3802.52 → 3803.84] Alright, so hold on a second.
[3803.84 → 3806.84] Let's go ahead and make sure we've got a good grip on the thing and-
[3806.84 → 3807.84] Ah!
[3807.84 → 3808.84] Ah!
[3808.84 → 3809.84] It's all over my hands!
[3809.84 → 3810.84] Oh shit!
[3810.84 → 3811.84] Nick!
[3811.84 → 3812.84] Nick!
[3812.84 → 3813.84] Nick, get in here!
[3813.84 → 3814.84] I don't have my phone!
[3814.84 → 3815.84] We've got a bit of a problem!
[3815.84 → 3816.84] I-
[3816.84 → 3817.84] I'm-
[3817.84 → 3819.84] What are you doing?
[3819.84 → 3820.84] I'm covering your nose!
[3820.84 → 3821.84] Is it our last seconds on the-
[3821.84 → 3822.84] I'm covering your nose!
[3822.84 → 3823.84] No!
[3823.84 → 3824.84] You need to make the most-
[3824.84 → 3825.84] Nick!
[3825.84 → 3826.84] Nick!
[3826.84 → 3827.84] I'm trying to stop the bleeding!
[3827.84 → 3828.84] Nick!
[3828.84 → 3829.84] What are you doing?
[3829.84 → 3830.84] Nick!
[3830.84 → 3832.84] You're- I think you're peaking the audio.
[3832.84 → 3833.84] Alright.
[3833.84 → 3835.84] Okay, obviously we're just-we're just messing with you guys.
[3835.84 → 3836.84] Hopefully I can clean that off my jacket.
[3836.84 → 3838.84] Oh, that stuff is disgusting.
[3838.84 → 3840.84] Oh, it's all over the place.
[3840.84 → 3842.84] Okay, Nick said it tasted like chocolate.
[3842.84 → 3843.84] No, it doesn't.
[3843.84 → 3844.84] It doesn't.
[3844.84 → 3846.84] He was lying to me.
[3846.84 → 3847.84] That liar.
[3847.84 → 3849.84] I don't think I'm going to be able to get this out of my jacket.
[3849.84 → 3850.84] I mean-
[3850.84 → 3851.84] We don't actually have any-
[3851.84 → 3852.84] It's only inner liner though.
[3852.84 → 3853.84] No, no, it's- it's washable.
[3853.84 → 3854.84] It's washable.
[3854.84 → 3855.84] I told people we were supposed to get-
[3855.84 → 3856.84] Um...
[3856.84 → 3859.84] Where's the paper towel and stuff?
[3859.84 → 3860.84] We didn't know you were going to get this out of my jacket.
[3860.84 → 3862.84] Uh, there's TP here.
[3862.84 → 3863.84] And this stuff tastes disgusting.
[3863.84 → 3864.84] It does not taste-
[3864.84 → 3866.84] You told me it tastes like chocolate!
[3866.84 → 3867.84] You're such a troll.
[3867.84 → 3869.84] Oh my goodness.
[3869.84 → 3871.84] Oh, man.
[3871.84 → 3872.84] Oh!
[3872.84 → 3877.84] Okay, so guys, just to be clear-
[3877.84 → 3879.84] Maybe he just thinks that chocolate tastes disgusting.
[3879.84 → 3880.84] This is-
[3880.84 → 3881.84] This is fake.
[3881.84 → 3884.84] And, uh, we were-we were just having some fun-
[3884.84 → 3885.84] You didn't know.
[3885.84 → 3886.84] Yeah.
[3886.84 → 3888.84] We were just-we were just having some fun because it's Halloween.
[3888.84 → 3891.84] Uh, but- but seriously, Dollar Shave Club, good stuff.
[3891.84 → 3893.84] Save time, save money.
[3893.84 → 3898.84] And, uh, thanks to Dollar Shave Club for being good sports about our, uh, our silly little,
[3898.84 → 3899.84] uh, our silly little thing.
[3899.84 → 3900.84] That's- that's okay.
[3900.84 → 3901.84] This is lots.
[3901.84 → 3902.84] This is lots.
[3902.84 → 3904.84] I'm just going to dump some water on it.
[3904.84 → 3905.84] Away from my laptop.
[3905.84 → 3908.84] The last thing it needs is to get water all over it again.
[3908.84 → 3909.84] Again.
[3909.84 → 3910.84] Yeah.
[3910.84 → 3911.84] For the second time.
[3911.84 → 3912.84] I don't know if it would survive that again.
[3912.84 → 3913.84] Alright, thanks guys.
[3913.84 → 3915.84] And those do not taste like chocolate.
[3915.84 → 3916.84] I hate you.
[3916.84 → 3917.84] You're such a jerk.
[3917.84 → 3918.84] Chocolate tastes terrible.
[3918.84 → 3919.84] Oh, it's awful.
[3919.84 → 3920.84] It's awful.
[3920.84 → 3924.84] If I'd known it was going to taste this bad, I would've brought myself something good to eat.
[3924.84 → 3929.84] What-like, if you had to compare it to something, what-what would be the most comparable thing?
[3929.84 → 3934.84] Um, it's about like, have you ever, um, have you ever eaten the stem of a dandelion?
[3934.84 → 3938.84] Probably like a really long time.
[3938.84 → 3940.84] Yeah, like when you were a kid or whatever, just because you're an idiot.
[3940.84 → 3941.84] Yeah.
[3941.84 → 3942.84] Like dandelion milk.
[3942.84 → 3945.84] You know, some kid tells you it tastes like real milk and you eat it.
[3945.84 → 3947.84] It tastes about like dandelion milk.
[3947.84 → 3949.84] Okay, I can't imagine that's good.
[3949.84 → 3955.84] Like that's- and dandelion milk is the kind of thing that people troll other people by telling them to eat because it's gross.
[3955.84 → 3956.84] So, yeah.
[3956.84 → 3957.84] Let's go ahead and-
[3957.84 → 3960.84] Oh, I got blood on my 5'4 shirt.
[3960.84 → 3962.84] Okay, so I think that's it for sponsor time.
[3962.84 → 3963.84] Guys, join the club.
[3963.84 → 3966.84] Visit dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus.
[3966.84 → 3972.84] Again, thanks to them for being good sports about our little, uh, our little fun thing that we decided to do.
[3972.84 → 3973.84] Alright.
[3973.84 → 3976.84] Let's go ahead and-
[3976.84 → 3981.84] I love how- I love how slow the reaction was to us sounding like there was something wrong.
[3981.84 → 3986.84] Yeah, they're obviously never going to save us if we're in like some sort of bad situation.
[3986.84 → 3991.84] Yeah, if there's ever a fire, I think we can pretty much count on having to go out that window-
[3991.84 → 3992.84] That window.
[3992.84 → 3994.84] And like us solving every problem.
[3994.84 → 3995.84] Yeah.
[3995.84 → 4002.84] Oh, actually one more thing that I really wanted to mention was we did a- we did a live stream with Modes.
[4002.84 → 4004.84] We've actually done two of them over the last few weeks.
[4004.84 → 4008.84] Uh, the last stream is going to be next Thursday, but there are some giveaways.
[4008.84 → 4015.84] So you guys are gonna wanna head over to blog.modus.com to qualify for a free membership to Code School.
[4015.84 → 4019.84] So if you're interested in learning coding, uh, Code School is a great place to-
[4019.84 → 4020.84] Yep.
[4020.84 → 4025.84] A great place to do that, and you can go to blog.modus.com slash code-school slash code-school giveaway-
[4025.84 → 4027.84] I've used like all of these web education services.
[4027.84 → 4034.84] Yeah, so go to- anyway, the point is gone to blog.modes, M-O-D-I-S dot com and uh, you can qualify for the giveaway
[4034.84 → 4036.84] and also check out that next stream.
[4036.84 → 4039.84] Um, stream number two in particular I thought was awesome.
[4039.84 → 4045.84] Our guest was fantastic, lots of fun, very bubbly personality, and it was really cool talking to her in particular.
[4045.84 → 4052.84] about, um, women, women in the programming space because she basically said, yeah, it's been great.
[4052.84 → 4053.84] More common than you would expect.
[4053.84 → 4054.84] Yeah, you know what?
[4054.84 → 4058.84] I noticed that when I did my, uh, Ubisoft studio tour in Montreal.
[4058.84 → 4060.84] There were so many women working there.
[4060.84 → 4061.84] Yep.
[4061.84 → 4071.84] And not just as secretaries, like, uh, one, like their, um, the, the lady who, uh, was talking to us about their state-of-the-art motion capture, for example.
[4071.84 → 4074.84] There you go.
[4074.84 → 4075.84] Yeah.
[4075.84 → 4076.84] Yeah.
[4076.84 → 4077.84] Yeah.
[4077.84 → 4078.84] Well like-
[4078.84 → 4080.84] Like, okay, when I was taking software engineering, it was a very low percentage.
[4080.84 → 4089.84] When I was taking, uh, like, computer science-y, IT, database-y courses, it was 25-30%, which is a lot more than what I think a lot of people would expect.
[4089.84 → 4092.84] Alright, so let's go ahead and, uh, move on.
[4092.84 → 4098.84] We've once again dicked around during the first two-thirds of the show and have very little time left.
[4098.84 → 4100.84] So, Far Cry 4 Dev.
[4100.84 → 4101.84] Oh, you all.
[4101.84 → 4102.84] Resolution doesn't sell games.
[4102.84 → 4103.84] Oh, you all.
[4103.84 → 4108.84] This was posted by Ralph Banyan on the forum, and the original article is from NeoGAF.
[4108.84 → 4109.84] Good for you.
[4109.84 → 4110.84] Good for you.
[4110.84 → 4140.84] 
[4140.84 → 4141.84] And-
[4141.84 → 4142.84] These things are not mutually exclusive.
[4142.84 → 4145.84] Yeah, you can have a fun game that also looks great.
[4145.84 → 4150.84] And it- and it's not like we're asking for every game to come out, like, 4K.
[4150.84 → 4153.84] We're asking for, like, a very reasonable amount.
[4153.84 → 4154.84] Yeah.
[4154.84 → 4159.84] We're asking for not immersion-breaking aliasing all over the place.
[4159.84 → 4160.84] We're trying to not go backwards.
[4160.84 → 4161.84] Yeah.
[4161.84 → 4163.84] We're not trying to shove you and push you incredibly hard to go forwards.
[4163.84 → 4165.84] You should be doing that on your own.
[4165.84 → 4166.84] Yeah.
[4166.84 → 4168.84] This ISN't- this ISN't- yeah.
[4168.84 → 4169.84] We're not even saying that.
[4169.84 → 4173.84] And of course, it's important to have new things in games.
[4173.84 → 4180.84] Um, like he says, a new spin on an evolution I think is more interesting, like, new-new topics, new-asking new questions.
[4180.84 → 4181.84] All that kind of stuff.
[4181.84 → 4182.84] Yeah.
[4182.84 → 4183.84] Do that.
[4183.84 → 4187.84] You can do that while having a reasonable amount of resolution and a reasonable frame rate.
[4187.84 → 4189.84] You don't have to have-
[4189.84 → 4190.84] Ugh.
[4190.84 → 4191.84] God, they make my brain hurt.
[4191.84 → 4192.84] My digging up.
[4192.84 → 4193.84] Why don't they just stop talking?
[4193.84 → 4194.84] Yeah.
[4194.84 → 4195.84] You've probably-
[4195.84 → 4196.84] Let's just stop talking about that.
[4196.84 → 4197.84] Speaking of things that I can't understand-
[4197.84 → 4198.84] Not even us.
[4198.84 → 4199.84] They need to stop talking.
[4199.84 → 4201.84] They just keep digging every single time.
[4201.84 → 4205.84] Speaking of things that I can't figure out why anyone actually cares about,
[4205.84 → 4208.84] Apple CEO Tim Cook comes out and says,
[4208.84 → 4209.84] I am proud to be gay.
[4209.84 → 4214.84] The original article is from money.cnn.com, and I think that's about all the attention
[4214.84 → 4218.84] that this topic deserves, because who gives a crap?
[4218.84 → 4219.84] Alright, moving on.
[4219.84 → 4220.84] Nobody should care.
[4220.84 → 4221.84] Yeah.
[4221.84 → 4222.84] At all.
[4222.84 → 4227.84] Although, one thing that I am kind of happy to see, though, is that, you know, we live in
[4227.84 → 4233.84] a time when we can have a non-white dude in the White House and the CEO of the most valuable
[4233.84 → 4236.84] company in America be openly gay.
[4236.84 → 4239.84] So, I guess that's pretty cool, isn't it?
[4239.84 → 4240.84] Yeah.
[4240.84 → 4241.84] Alright, so-
[4241.84 → 4242.84] And it has been, yeah.
[4242.84 → 4243.84] X-Wing and Tie Fighter.
[4243.84 → 4244.84] Oh my-
[4244.84 → 4246.84] I'm going to jump a spew.
[4246.84 → 4247.84] Speaking of-
[4247.84 → 4248.84] Because we have to have that.
[4248.84 → 4253.84] Speaking of pixelated games, I- I- I- have you already bought them?
[4253.84 → 4254.84] No.
[4254.84 → 4257.84] Oh, I- I didn't know it was a thing until, like, pretty close to before the show.
[4257.84 → 4260.84] Okay, and there's a- there's a guide on, um, crap, I have it bookmarked.
[4260.84 → 4265.84] I can't remember what site it is, but they've got a guide on updating the graphics of X-Wing.
[4265.84 → 4266.84] Haven't looked into it for Tie Fighter yet.
[4266.84 → 4269.84] Tie Fighter was actually my favourite of the games.
[4269.84 → 4274.84] I actually never even finished the campaign of X-Wing, but Tie Fighter is one of my favourite
[4274.84 → 4280.84] games of all time, and it has stood up to the test of time surprisingly well.
[4280.84 → 4286.84] Great story, great music score, great gameplay-fantastic gameplay.
[4286.84 → 4289.84] The missions are challenging in a way that new games really aren't.
[4289.84 → 4295.84] Like, you can be out there flying for 45 minutes, and, like, some shuttle takes off from
[4295.84 → 4299.84] somewhere that you need to intercept, and you're in the wrong part of the battlefield.
[4299.84 → 4303.84] You don't get over there, you don't divert everything away from weapons and shields,
[4303.84 → 4306.84] and get the crap over there and disable that thing.
[4306.84 → 4308.84] You failed the mission, you start over.
[4308.84 → 4310.84] Like, great game.
[4310.84 → 4312.84] And, uh, so they're on good old games-
[4312.84 → 4316.84] And the resolution for the time it was released was probably just fine, Ubisoft.
[4316.84 → 4318.84] Uh, you need a joystick to play.
[4318.84 → 4323.84] I think the original 1994 release, like the one that I had, uh, you could play with a mouse, but it was stupid.
[4323.84 → 4325.84] It was stupid, it was bad.
[4325.84 → 4327.84] It was like super, terrible.
[4327.84 → 4332.84] I specifically bought a joystick for TIE Fighter, and it was worth every penny.
[4332.84 → 4337.84] In fact, that joystick is here at the office, and I've been meaning to take it home forever,
[4337.84 → 4340.84] because I finally bought a USB to game port adapter.
[4340.84 → 4341.84] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4341.84 → 4347.84] So I am planning to go home this weekend and play TIE Fighter with my Top Gun joystick.
[4347.84 → 4348.84] So bad.
[4348.84 → 4350.84] I'm actually going to go get that, so I can show it off right now.
[4350.84 → 4351.84] You want to handle the next topic?
[4351.84 → 4352.84] Do you have your streaming setup hooked up?
[4352.84 → 4353.84] I'm sorry?
[4353.84 → 4354.84] Do you have your streaming setup hooked up so you can stream that?
[4354.84 → 4358.84] Um, yeah, I don't need to take my webcam away anymore, so I have my webcam at home.
[4358.84 → 4359.84] You should stream that.
[4359.84 → 4361.84] Maybe I should stream some time.
[4361.84 → 4362.84] I don't even-
[4362.84 → 4363.84] Oh, oh, oh.
[4363.84 → 4364.84] Not going to trip on this again.
[4364.84 → 4365.84] Nope, not happening.
[4365.84 → 4366.84] There you go.
[4366.84 → 4367.84] Good work.
[4367.84 → 4369.84] I'm jumping back to the dock.
[4369.84 → 4371.84] That's like the last thing that I really want to-
[4371.84 → 4373.84] Nope, there are a few other things that are perfect.
[4373.84 → 4374.84] What should I tackle?
[4374.84 → 4377.84] YouTube 60fps is finally here.
[4377.84 → 4384.84] Um, you need to select the 1080p 60 or 720p 60 options in your quality settings for it to work.
[4384.84 → 4393.84] I know some people have, uh, apps for like Firefox or Chrome, which will automatically select the highest end possible thing.
[4393.84 → 4400.84] Um, you might need to disable that for certain people that are releasing, uh, certain videos for it to be able to actually work properly.
[4400.84 → 4404.84] I don't know, but I'm sure they'll fix those options at some point.
[4404.84 → 4405.84] What's this?
[4405.84 → 4406.84] YouTube, oh, 60fps.
[4406.84 → 4407.84] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4407.84 → 4409.84] People keep asking if we're going to do 60fps videos.
[4409.84 → 4410.84] The answer is no.
[4410.84 → 4415.84] Um, unless we're- we're talking like gameplay videos or something that really benefits from it.
[4415.84 → 4422.84] Product showcases and reviews and like that do not benefit in any tangible way from 60fps.
[4422.84 → 4426.84] And I would rather shoot in 4K.
[4426.84 → 4429.84] And right now it's one or the other for us with our filming equipment.
[4429.84 → 4432.84] And yeah, and, and data storage.
[4432.84 → 4433.84] And that too.
[4433.84 → 4434.84] Yeah, 4K is already killing us.
[4434.84 → 4438.84] The fastest possible we shot today, 80 gigs with the new recording format.
[4438.84 → 4440.84] Pretty insane.
[4440.84 → 4447.84] Fortunately, we'll be doing an updated Ultimate NAS with eight Seagate 6TB enterprise grade drives.
[4447.84 → 4449.84] So yeah, that's 48TB.
[4449.84 → 4450.84] So awesome.
[4450.84 → 4453.84] Yeah, Ruskin server's getting an upgrade there, baby.
[4453.84 → 4455.84] Um, okay, so what else we got?
[4455.84 → 4458.84] I can't wait till we get a Linus Media Group petabyte.
[4458.84 → 4460.84] Oh, T-Mobile CEO!
[4460.84 → 4461.84] Oh, that's hilarious.
[4461.84 → 4462.84] This guy is crazy.
[4462.84 → 4463.84] He's nuts.
[4463.84 → 4464.84] He's insane.
[4464.84 → 4465.84] I love him.
[4465.84 → 4467.84] Every time he opens his mouth, it's solid gold.
[4467.84 → 4469.84] Don't buy your iPad from us.
[4469.84 → 4473.84] New iPads from major US carriers are network locked.
[4473.84 → 4476.84] And he basically says, look, we didn't ask for this.
[4476.84 → 4478.84] We didn't want this.
[4478.84 → 4482.84] We don't want these iPads to be locked, but they're locked out of the factory.
[4482.84 → 4483.84] Don't buy your iPad from us.
[4483.84 → 4485.84] Go buy it from the Apple Store.
[4485.84 → 4486.84] And then bring it to us.
[4486.84 → 4488.84] Which is great.
[4488.84 → 4491.84] So the Sims are pre-locked, just to be clear.
[4491.84 → 4492.84] Yeah.
[4492.84 → 4494.84] So he just says, what is this?
[4494.84 → 4495.84] This is stupid.
[4495.84 → 4498.84] He said, so he tweeted out, my advice to everyone, and I'll get in trouble for this, buy it from
[4498.84 → 4500.84] the Apple Store.
[4500.84 → 4501.84] Love it.
[4501.84 → 4502.84] He's great.
[4502.84 → 4504.84] He's absolutely fantastic.
[4504.84 → 4507.84] IBM is fighting Ebola with a supercomputer.
[4507.84 → 4512.84] So they teamed up with Cambridge University Africa's Voices Project, Telco firm.
[4512.84 → 4513.84] Okay.
[4513.84 → 4516.84] So they teamed up with a bunch of, wow, a bunch of really important stuff.
[4516.84 → 4520.84] They developed a system that lets people report Ebola related issues and concerns via
[4520.84 → 4522.84] SMS or voice calls.
[4522.84 → 4526.84] And basically what they had to say about it is, for us to tackle Ebola, it is crucial to
[4526.84 → 4530.84] maintain an open dialogue between the government and the people.
[4530.84 → 4537.84] So, creating opinion-based heat maps that show areas of worry and areas of infection, and
[4537.84 → 4541.84] has already highlighted regions with growing numbers of suspected infections.
[4541.84 → 4546.34] Also working with Nigeria, so they've been cleared of disease, to support preparedness for
[4546.34 → 4547.34] future outbreaks.
[4547.34 → 4549.34] You can play Plague Inc. with real life.
[4549.34 → 4550.34] Cool.
[4550.34 → 4551.34] Yeah.
[4551.34 → 4557.34] AMD is going to be launching, or relaunching, the R9 290X with 8 gigs of memory.
[4557.34 → 4560.34] We actually have a pretty exciting project coming up with that.
[4560.34 → 4561.34] Yeah.
[4561.34 → 4569.34] Three 34-inch curved LG monitors running off of triple R9 290X 8 gig cards.
[4569.34 → 4575.34] We're talking like 15, I think it's like 14 megapixels and change of resolution, surround
[4575.34 → 4576.34] gaming curve.
[4576.34 → 4579.34] What's the dollar value in that in just GPUs and monitors?
[4579.34 → 4580.34] Uh, six grand?
[4580.34 → 4581.34] Yeah.
[4581.34 → 4582.34] Nice.
[4582.34 → 4583.34] Yeah.
[4583.34 → 4584.34] Like we're talking some badass stuff.
[4584.34 → 4585.34] That'll look really cool.
[4585.34 → 4586.34] Nice.
[4586.34 → 4588.34] Like we're talking, we're talking some badass stuff.
[4588.34 → 4589.34] That'll look really cool.
[4589.34 → 4595.34] Currently only available from Sapphire, but Club 3D Power Colour, I think MSI is coming
[4595.34 → 4596.34] out with one.
[4596.34 → 4601.34] Um, and this will be available for the holiday season in order to better compete, presumably,
[4601.34 → 4602.34] with the GTX 980.
[4602.34 → 4606.34] These will be custom-cooled cards with higher clock rates than reference.
[4606.34 → 4611.34] And to be clear, guys, even AMD is not going to be like, yeah, 8 gigs of memory, it's gonna
[4611.34 → 4613.34] like, do things.
[4613.34 → 4616.34] You know, it's more of a future-proofing thing.
[4616.34 → 4622.34] It's more of an if you're running in Crossfire, and you're running games at 4K, it's more of
[4622.34 → 4625.34] a BS ready for higher resolution textures.
[4625.34 → 4628.34] Because we are finally getting games that are able to use a 4G frame buffer.
[4628.34 → 4633.34] So if you want something that's going to be able to continue to keep up with higher resolution
[4633.34 → 4635.34] textures, it might be worth considering.
[4635.34 → 4640.34] I personally hate the F word, future-proofing, but there you go.
[4640.34 → 4641.34] That's what it is.
[4641.34 → 4646.34] Um, I did hear a rumour though that Nvidia is planning to launch 8G versions of the 980 and
[4646.34 → 4648.34] 970 to counter this card.
[4648.34 → 4650.34] So we'll have to see how that all shakes down.
[4650.34 → 4654.34] Happy to see that at the same, as, because as long as they have the lower, like,
[4654.34 → 4659.34] the lower RAM amount, cheaper cards as well, because not everyone will need them, I think
[4659.34 → 4660.34] it'll be perfect.
[4660.34 → 4662.34] Because some people will, but not everybody.
[4662.34 → 4667.34] Alright, so, what else we got here?
[4667.34 → 4671.34] I guess we don't really have much more time, so maybe we'll do some, uh, maybe we'll do
[4671.34 → 4673.34] some rapid-fire topics.
[4673.34 → 4674.34] Sure.
[4674.34 → 4680.34] Speaking of LG and their curved 34-inch monitor, LG releases 31-inch Cinema 4K IPS monitor.
[4680.34 → 4688.34] So rather than being 3840 by 2160, this is the full 4K, not Ultra HD.
[4688.34 → 4690.34] To be clear, they are different.
[4690.34 → 4695.34] I believe it's 4160 by 2160 or 41...
[4695.34 → 4697.34] Oh crap, now I forget.
[4697.34 → 4699.34] 4096 by 2160.
[4699.34 → 4700.34] There we go.
[4700.34 → 4704.34] The article on RedmondPie.com saved me here.
[4704.34 → 4711.34] And they are saying that it is suitable for professional use, and considering that it's
[4711.34 → 4714.34] coming in at a mere $1,400?
[4714.34 → 4715.34] Wow.
[4715.34 → 4716.34] Whoa, that's actually cheaper than I thought.
[4716.34 → 4717.34] That's a lot cheaper than I thought.
[4717.34 → 4722.34] Still expensive, but it's not as expensive as I expected for that product.
[4722.34 → 4725.34] Yeah, I mean, compared to other professional-grade displays.
[4725.34 → 4726.34] Yeah, exactly.
[4726.34 → 4730.34] I mean, this is a pro-grade resolution, and they're saying it's going to be suitable for,
[4730.34 → 4734.34] uh, for colour work and for professional video editors and all that kind of stuff.
[4734.34 → 4737.34] This looks absolutely fantastic.
[4737.34 → 4738.34] Nice, thin bezel.
[4738.34 → 4743.34] It's, uh, got Thunderbolt capability, so you'll be able to connect it to your Mac Pro.
[4743.34 → 4749.34] Nice, professional-looking, uh, stand that will look completely at home in an office environment.
[4749.34 → 4752.34] Looks like it's got some ergonomic adjustments.
[4752.34 → 4754.34] I don't know if we're going to get pivot here.
[4754.34 → 4755.34] Yeah.
[4755.34 → 4759.34] But it looks like we should at least have swivel, height adjust, and tilt.
[4759.34 → 4760.34] And it does have a VESA mount.
[4760.34 → 4761.34] VESA, yeah.
[4761.34 → 4764.34] So you could mount it to another arm if you wanted.
[4764.34 → 4766.34] One thing we need to do is build logs.
[4766.34 → 4767.34] Yeah.
[4767.34 → 4768.34] And there's a new format for that.
[4768.34 → 4769.34] I don't know if you've seen that.
[4769.34 → 4770.34] That's fine.
[4770.34 → 4771.34] Okay.
[4771.34 → 4774.34] Um, also Reddit is launching their own crowdfunding site.
[4774.34 → 4778.34] They do seem to be a little late to the party here, but its called Reddit Made.
[4778.34 → 4781.34] This was actually posted by Tech Dreamer on the forum.
[4781.34 → 4785.34] It's going to focus more on physical goods like t-shirts, and the company will take a small
[4785.34 → 4789.34] cut of the campaign to cover the costs of its platform.
[4789.34 → 4791.34] I mean, Reddit has so much potential.
[4791.34 → 4795.34] They just have, they have so much mind share, and they have such a large audience.
[4795.34 → 4799.34] It's just, I mean, I don't know that they're ever going to turn Reddit.com into something
[4799.34 → 4801.34] profitable, but...
[4801.34 → 4803.34] They could turn spinoffs like this.
[4803.34 → 4807.34] Spinoffs like this could be the future of that company, and could be the thing that
[4807.34 → 4810.34] allows them to really turn into a massively profitable company.
[4810.34 → 4814.34] Their daily gold, Reddit gold thing, has been very helpful for them, I believe.
[4814.34 → 4815.34] Yep.
[4815.34 → 4820.34] And the PC Master Race in general, actually, the amount of gold that goes through that
[4820.34 → 4821.34] Subreddit is insane.
[4821.34 → 4823.34] I don't know if you've ever seen that.
[4823.34 → 4827.34] They're like one of the most, I think they are the or one of the most gilded Subreddits,
[4827.34 → 4828.34] like, ever.
[4828.34 → 4832.34] And they're fairly small compared to other relative Subreddits.
[4832.34 → 4834.34] I think it's only around 250,000 members.
[4834.34 → 4839.34] I'm not even sure, but they're pretty impressive in terms of helping out Reddit, which is actually
[4839.34 → 4840.34] pretty cool to see.
[4840.34 → 4841.34] So this is cool.
[4841.34 → 4843.34] Project Aura just got an update.
[4843.34 → 4844.34] Considering it's their home.
[4844.34 → 4850.34] There is a real live, honest to goodness, functioning test phone that boots into Android.
[4850.34 → 4856.34] Google plans to hold its second Aura conference on January 14th, so that's right around CES
[4856.34 → 4857.34] time.
[4857.34 → 4858.34] And here it is.
[4858.34 → 4862.34] So there's a this is on the Phone Blocks blog.
[4862.34 → 4863.34] Project Aura update.
[4863.34 → 4865.34] Look at that.
[4865.34 → 4870.34] Let's go ahead and actually skip to the part where we get to see it.
[4870.34 → 4871.34] There we go.
[4871.34 → 4873.34] So you could, oh, dang it.
[4873.34 → 4874.34] There we go.
[4874.34 → 4875.34] So, don't move it.
[4875.34 → 4876.34] Hey, hey, hold still.
[4876.34 → 4881.34] All right, so you can see that the modules are going to be different sizes here.
[4881.34 → 4885.34] That's something that I think a lot of people were not really hoping for.
[4885.34 → 4886.34] Yeah.
[4886.34 → 4889.34] They were kind of hoping for just a grid-based system on the back, and you could rearrange
[4889.34 → 4891.34] things Tetris style if you wanted to.
[4891.34 → 4895.34] But I think that as a first step, this probably makes a ton of sense.
[4895.34 → 4896.34] Yeah.
[4896.34 → 4900.34] Because not everything needs to be as large as a battery or CPU and cooling module.
[4900.34 → 4903.34] But yeah, look at that.
[4903.34 → 4904.34] It boots into Android.
[4904.34 → 4906.34] So that happens, hold on.
[4906.34 → 4907.34] There you go.
[4907.34 → 4908.34] That's really cool.
[4908.34 → 4909.34] Yeah.
[4909.34 → 4913.34] And it's not as, it's not as chunky here.
[4913.34 → 4914.34] But profile view.
[4914.34 → 4915.34] Hey, got me.
[4915.34 → 4916.34] It's not, not chunky.
[4916.34 → 4917.34] Yeah.
[4917.34 → 4918.34] It's not, not chunky.
[4918.34 → 4919.34] But it's also not that big either.
[4919.34 → 4922.34] But it's also not nearly as chunky as I was expecting.
[4922.34 → 4927.34] And given that we're not going to see a commercial product for another generation or two of other
[4927.34 → 4930.34] smartphones, it could continue to catch up.
[4930.34 → 4932.34] When is the release date for Project RF?
[4932.34 → 4934.34] I, okay, hold on a second.
[4934.34 → 4935.34] I'm not sure.
[4935.34 → 4937.34] Because it could be sooner, I think.
[4937.34 → 4940.34] I don't think they've actually committed to one.
[4940.34 → 4941.34] January 2015, $50.
[4941.34 → 4945.34] No, I think this was a fairly, fairly certain thing.
[4945.34 → 4947.34] The $50 January 2013 thing.
[4947.34 → 4950.34] I mean January 2015, not 13.
[4950.34 → 4951.34] I'm in the past.
[4951.34 → 4953.34] Uh, the, the, the, the, the.
[4953.34 → 4955.34] Modular smartphone, we'll call it la-di-da.
[4955.34 → 4957.34] April 15, 2014.
[4957.34 → 4959.34] Okay, well, I don't, I'm not, okay.
[4959.34 → 4960.34] I'm not, okay.
[4960.34 → 4965.34] If it's the size that it is now, I mean that doesn't actually look that much chunkier than
[4965.34 → 4967.34] something like a Peria Z2.
[4967.34 → 4970.34] I would be very, very, very excited to check this one out.
[4970.34 → 4971.34] Yeah.
[4971.34 → 4972.34] And I would definitely order one.
[4972.34 → 4973.34] Yeah, for sure.
[4973.34 → 4977.34] Uh, announced today at the Project ARA Developers Conference that it is the first
[4977.34 → 4982.34] modular smartphone will go on sale in January 2015 for the low price of $50.
[4982.34 → 4986.34] And it will be a boring grade design, uh, device by design.
[4986.34 → 4990.34] So to, uh, get people to customize it themselves.
[4990.34 → 4991.34] Interesting.
[4991.34 → 4996.34] I don't know if it's still kind of the plan or what, but yeah.
[4996.34 → 4997.34] All right.
[4997.34 → 5005.34] So PS4 Slim and Xbox One are both, or PS4 Slim is also, is a rumoured thing.
[5005.34 → 5006.34] Yeah.
[5006.34 → 5014.34] The PS4 and the Xbox One are both rumoured to be getting hardware upgrades sometime in 2015.
[5014.34 → 5015.34] Wow.
[5015.34 → 5022.34] If that's not an admission of failure, I mean, what, what, it's, it's funny.
[5022.34 → 5027.34] The whole PC Master Race thing is kind of funny to me now when a console is just a PC in every
[5027.34 → 5028.34] possible way.
[5028.34 → 5029.34] Yeah.
[5029.34 → 5030.34] Yeah.
[5030.34 → 5033.34] You still have to download a patch for your game on launch day.
[5033.34 → 5034.34] Yeah.
[5034.34 → 5038.34] Regardless of PC or console version, you're still going to need system updates.
[5038.34 → 5041.34] You're still probably going to need an update when they release these new systems so that
[5041.34 → 5045.34] you can play older games at higher resolutions and frame rates.
[5045.34 → 5046.34] Yep.
[5046.34 → 5050.34] You're going to have to actually look at the back of the at the back of the disc case in
[5050.34 → 5053.34] order to find out which system it works for.
[5053.34 → 5057.34] And you're actually, you're not just going to buy a box and have that work for you for
[5057.34 → 5058.34] five or eight years or whatever else.
[5058.34 → 5062.34] You're actually going to have to upgrade except instead of dropping in a new graphics card
[5062.34 → 5063.34] once in a while.
[5063.34 → 5071.34] Now you get to buy a completely new box and the real, the terrifying thing about Xbox
[5071.34 → 5078.34] one and PS four and the owners for those consoles is that unlike previous generation consoles
[5078.34 → 5084.34] like the 360 and the PlayStation three, which I think retained some value because of their
[5084.34 → 5089.34] game library and Xbox One and a PlayStation four.
[5089.34 → 5091.34] What value will they have?
[5091.34 → 5096.34] What value does a console that now, and now developers that whole argument of, Oh, it's
[5096.34 → 5097.34] easier to develop for the console.
[5097.34 → 5099.34] Because it's one piece of hardware.
[5099.34 → 5100.34] Ha.
[5100.34 → 5102.34] Now those two consoles are going to be four pieces of hardware.
[5102.34 → 5107.34] So these, those original launch consoles aren't going to have disadvantages like smaller
[5107.34 → 5111.34] onboard hard drives or, you know, HD DVD or whatever.
[5111.34 → 5112.34] It's, it's not going to be like that.
[5112.34 → 5116.34] It's going to be like, you're going to be running the same games as your buddy with his
[5116.34 → 5123.34] Xbox One gen two, but at crappier details, just like on the PC, just like if you had
[5123.34 → 5125.34] another PC and no one is going to want that.
[5125.34 → 5128.34] And I'm still laughing off in the corner with my Wii U and my PC combo.
[5128.34 → 5130.34] Cause that's the way to go.
[5130.34 → 5131.34] So there you go.
[5131.34 → 5136.34] Anyway, it is Halloween today, and I am going trick or treating with my kids.
[5136.34 → 5137.34] We have to do the build logs.
[5137.34 → 5139.34] So we're doing the build log now.
[5139.34 → 5140.34] And then we're good.
[5140.34 → 5141.34] Alright, here, you handle this.
[5141.34 → 5142.34] No, it's super easy.
[5142.34 → 5143.34] I want you to do it.
[5143.34 → 5145.34] Click on the click on the link.
[5145.34 → 5146.34] Uh huh.
[5146.34 → 5147.34] No, what?
[5147.34 → 5148.34] Here, you do it.
[5148.34 → 5149.34] No, no, go back.
[5149.34 → 5150.34] Go back, go back, go back, go back.
[5150.34 → 5151.34] You can do this.
[5151.34 → 5152.34] You can do this.
[5152.34 → 5153.34] I hate you.
[5153.34 → 5154.34] I believe you.
[5154.34 → 5155.34] Actually the build log.
[5155.34 → 5156.34] There you go.
[5156.34 → 5157.34] Uh huh.
[5157.34 → 5158.34] I want to show you how this works.
[5158.34 → 5159.34] Yeah.
[5159.34 → 5160.34] Because it'll work.
[5160.34 → 5162.34] Uh, I might want to wait till it goes.
[5162.34 → 5164.34] Why is it not loading?
[5164.34 → 5165.34] Really easy.
[5165.34 → 5167.34] And no!
[5167.34 → 5169.34] It's really easy though.
[5169.34 → 5171.34] It's just, there, okay.
[5171.34 → 5173.34] And then, why is it so slow?
[5173.34 → 5174.34] You're slow.
[5174.34 → 5177.34] Aww, that was mean.
[5177.34 → 5178.34] Hashtag it wrecked.
[5178.34 → 5182.34] No, you can full screen this once it loads.
[5182.34 → 5183.34] Full screen you.
[5183.34 → 5186.34] Speaking of full screen, we're on full screen now.
[5186.34 → 5187.34] Yay!
[5187.34 → 5189.34] We actually changed YouTube networks, so.
[5189.34 → 5191.34] We're still going to be doing all, did I mention this already?
[5191.34 → 5192.34] I don't think so.
[5192.34 → 5193.34] Oh, okay.
[5193.34 → 5196.34] I think you mentioned that you were going to in the after party last week.
[5196.34 → 5197.34] Oh.
[5197.34 → 5198.34] I don't think everyone saw it.
[5198.34 → 5199.34] I could be wrong.
[5199.34 → 5200.34] Okay, well whatever.
[5200.34 → 5201.34] We're still going to live stream on Twitch.
[5201.34 → 5202.34] We still love Twitch.
[5202.34 → 5203.34] They're good guys.
[5203.34 → 5205.34] Uh, but we're on full screen for YouTube now.
[5205.34 → 5206.34] Yeah.
[5206.34 → 5207.34] Okay, so I'll full screen this.
[5207.34 → 5210.34] I will get us the truck out of the frame.
[5210.34 → 5211.34] Yes, I want to allow it.
[5211.34 → 5212.34] Alright.
[5212.34 → 5214.34] So this is the voters pick.
[5214.34 → 5217.34] This is Mr. Tough 2.0, which you can probably see why it's called that.
[5217.34 → 5218.34] Because it has a safer tooth.
[5218.34 → 5219.34] Safer tooth.
[5219.34 → 5221.34] Safer tooth tough series motherboard.
[5221.34 → 5222.34] Yeah.
[5222.34 → 5223.34] Carbide air 540.
[5223.34 → 5224.34] Yeah.
[5224.34 → 5227.34] 90 gig Kingston hyper X.
[5227.34 → 5228.34] That's an older, wow that's an older SSD.
[5228.34 → 5229.34] And a 240.
[5229.34 → 5230.34] And a 240 gig.
[5230.34 → 5231.34] Yeah.
[5231.34 → 5232.34] Lots of water cooling gear.
[5232.34 → 5233.34] So this is progress shot.
[5233.34 → 5234.34] Oh, very nice.
[5234.34 → 5235.34] Definitely progress shot.
[5235.34 → 5236.34] Keep going.
[5236.34 → 5237.34] Now it looks totally different.
[5237.34 → 5238.34] Whoa.
[5238.34 → 5243.34] That's a cool, that's like a carbon fibre.
[5243.34 → 5244.34] Digicam.
[5244.34 → 5247.34] Digicam cool like thing, actually.
[5247.34 → 5248.34] Yeah.
[5248.34 → 5249.34] I like it.
[5249.34 → 5251.34] I do really like it overall.
[5251.34 → 5255.34] The only thing I was like, what was the cable sleeving?
[5255.34 → 5260.34] Cause everything is like, even the rings on the fans are green and all the tubing is green.
[5260.34 → 5263.34] And then the motherboard is all crazy and stuff and the cable sleeving is like, what did we do?
[5263.34 → 5265.34] There was an opportunity to do camo sleeving here.
[5265.34 → 5266.34] Yes.
[5266.34 → 5267.34] Definitely.
[5267.34 → 5268.34] That's the only thing.
[5268.34 → 5269.34] It's amazingly cool computer.
[5269.34 → 5270.34] Look at that.
[5270.34 → 5271.34] I love what he did with it.
[5271.34 → 5272.34] Love that.
[5272.34 → 5276.34] Love that this matches the inside over here.
[5276.34 → 5278.34] Super, super cool.
[5278.34 → 5279.34] I really like it.
[5279.34 → 5281.34] I think you would just escape to get out of it.
[5281.34 → 5282.34] And then there's one more.
[5282.34 → 5283.34] Then there's the staff pick.
[5283.34 → 5286.34] And the procedure is the same.
[5286.34 → 5292.34] Alright, so I wait for the slowest balls, supposedly easy to use, sight to load here.
[5292.34 → 5293.34] There we go.
[5293.34 → 5294.34] That was a little bit better.
[5294.34 → 5295.34] Alright, so this is Ark.
[5295.34 → 5296.34] There you go.
[5296.34 → 5297.34] Ark of the Covenant.
[5297.34 → 5300.34] By km.
[5300.34 → 5302.34] This is the staff pick.
[5302.34 → 5307.34] You know, they should remake Raiders with the Ark of the Covenant being like Halo themed.
[5307.34 → 5311.34] No they shouldn't.
[5311.34 → 5313.34] There's a different covenant mind you.
[5313.34 → 5314.34] No.
[5314.34 → 5317.34] It's funny cause both of those things work, but they should really not do that.
[5317.34 → 5319.34] Wow, I love this.
[5319.34 → 5322.34] Dual Eons, 64 gig SSD.
[5322.34 → 5325.34] But then three 120 gig SSDs.
[5325.34 → 5326.34] Yeah.
[5326.34 → 5327.34] Two 7870 Hawk edition.
[5327.34 → 5331.34] So I'm thinking gaming is a lower priority than crunching.
[5331.34 → 5332.34] Wow.
[5332.34 → 5335.34] Didn't expect that small of a case.
[5335.34 → 5336.34] Wow.
[5336.34 → 5337.34] That is very cool.
[5337.34 → 5339.34] So this is in the beginning.
[5339.34 → 5340.34] Uh huh.
[5340.34 → 5341.34] Some tweaks.
[5341.34 → 5342.34] Liking it.
[5342.34 → 5343.34] Liking them tracer memory modules.
[5343.34 → 5344.34] That's so sick.
[5344.34 → 5345.34] All that blue.
[5345.34 → 5346.34] Wow.
[5346.34 → 5347.34] What a sexy rig.
[5347.34 → 5348.34] Super nice.
[5348.34 → 5355.34] Lee and Lee does such a great job of the designs of their cases.
[5355.34 → 5356.34] Yeah.
[5356.34 → 5364.34] We actually have a review for a PCQ-19 Lee and Lee case coming out this weekend.
[5364.34 → 5368.34] And I was, I was, I love the aesthetics of it.
[5368.34 → 5369.34] I love the design.
[5369.34 → 5371.34] But the performance of it is just not there.
[5371.34 → 5376.34] I make some suggestions though in terms of tweaks for the case that I want to see made.
[5376.34 → 5387.34] And I really hope that either Lee and Lee or maybe Silverstone, I have some hope for Silverstone, or Cooler Master, the ones that I originally pitched this idea to, I hope someone makes the case that I'm asking for.
[5387.34 → 5395.34] Because I think we could do a fully custom IT gaming rig in a case the size of a PS4 if we do it right.
[5395.34 → 5396.34] Yeah.
[5396.34 → 5397.34] With a couple of expansion drives.
[5397.34 → 5399.34] I know you've been talking about that for a little while, yeah.
[5399.34 → 5401.34] Uh, yeah, for a little while.
[5401.34 → 5403.34] For a little while I've been talking about that.
[5403.34 → 5405.34] I really do want that to happen.
[5405.34 → 5407.34] Yeah, I completely agree.
[5407.34 → 5408.34] Alright.
[5408.34 → 5409.34] So, I, I don't know.
[5409.34 → 5414.34] Here's, I guess, one really cool, one really cool update.
[5414.34 → 5421.34] Um, VGA has just confirmed that they have shipped us a GTX 980 classified.
[5421.34 → 5424.34] So we will have a video coming out about that.
[5424.34 → 5425.34] Uh, this is great.
[5425.34 → 5430.34] They figure out of the box the card should do around 1570 megahertz OC.
[5430.34 → 5431.34] Out of the box.
[5431.34 → 5432.34] Yep.
[5432.34 → 5435.34] And in the next few weeks they figure 1600 plus.
[5435.34 → 5436.34] That'll be fun.
[5436.34 → 5437.34] I'm excited to play with that.
[5437.34 → 5438.34] Yeah.
[5438.34 → 5439.34] That's cool.
[5439.34 → 5440.34] Yeah, yeah.
[5440.34 → 5441.34] So, so yeah, that should be, that should be pretty good.
[5441.34 → 5442.34] Nice.
[5442.34 → 5447.34] Also, we are, we are already talking to other manufacturers about doing more factory tours.
[5447.34 → 5450.34] So a lot of you guys loved the Cherry MX factory tour.
[5450.34 → 5452.34] We have the Sennheiser one coming still.
[5452.34 → 5453.34] Yeah.
[5453.34 → 5459.34] So it was, uh, Cherry and Sennheiser that sponsored us to, to be over there and to do those factory
[5459.34 → 5460.34] tours.
[5460.34 → 5465.34] I mean, honestly, like between, between you guys and me and the wall, we did not make money
[5465.34 → 5466.34] on the trip.
[5466.34 → 5467.34] No.
[5467.34 → 5469.34] So it was just a matter of, we had to pay for flights.
[5469.34 → 5473.34] I had to pay for people to like work for me and be there and stuff.
[5473.34 → 5477.34] But, but the company didn't, didn't pull a profit on that trip.
[5477.34 → 5481.34] I just thought it would be like a really cool experience and potentially really cool content.
[5481.34 → 5482.34] It was more of an experiment.
[5482.34 → 5486.34] And we have heard you guys, you have spoken, you want more factory tours.
[5486.34 → 5490.34] So we're talking to a couple of companies based in, with their manufacturing based in
[5490.34 → 5492.34] Taiwan about potentially doing some more of them.
[5492.34 → 5495.34] Because we're trying to like bundle up trips cause then it makes a lot more financial sense.
[5495.34 → 5496.34] Yes.
[5496.34 → 5499.34] It's really hard to justify going somewhere.
[5499.34 → 5501.34] Individual trip every time.
[5501.34 → 5502.34] One company.
[5502.34 → 5503.34] No.
[5503.34 → 5507.34] So if we can get two or three on board, then it becomes less of a burden for the sponsors
[5507.34 → 5509.34] to pay for all of our travel expenses and all that.
[5509.34 → 5514.34] And it becomes more sensible for us to be out of the office for a week to, you know,
[5514.34 → 5517.34] create more than one video, hopefully.
[5517.34 → 5518.34] Yes.
[5518.34 → 5519.34] So lots of exciting stuff coming.
[5519.34 → 5521.34] Also we've got videos.
[5521.34 → 5526.34] Oh, mineral oil video two is going to be coming next week.
[5526.34 → 5527.34] So stay tuned for that.
[5527.34 → 5532.34] And we will hopefully do mineral oil three next week.
[5532.34 → 5535.34] Hopefully we'll film mineral oil three next week.
[5535.34 → 5536.34] Yeah.
[5536.34 → 5537.34] So that we can keep it kind of rolling.
[5537.34 → 5540.34] I'm hoping to film X 99 overclocking guide next week as well.
[5540.34 → 5543.34] Actually, we've got lots of great stuff coming over the next little bit.
[5543.34 → 5544.34] We'll see you in the other board videos.
[5544.34 → 5545.34] Yep.
[5545.34 → 5546.34] I don't know when those will be ready.
[5546.34 → 5547.34] Right.
[5547.34 → 5548.34] Yeah.
[5548.34 → 5549.34] Do you want to talk about what you're working on though?
[5549.34 → 5550.34] Should we do this in after party?
[5550.34 → 5551.34] Sure.
[5551.34 → 5552.34] Okay.
[5552.34 → 5553.34] The lunch is over.
[5553.34 → 5554.34] Bye.
[5554.34 → 5555.34] Bye.
[5555.34 → 5558.34] We're going to take this hat off because it's making my nose itchy.
[5558.34 → 5559.34] That made sense.
[5559.34 → 5560.34] It's these things.
[5560.34 → 5561.34] Yeah.
[5561.34 → 5564.34] Are you sure your nose is itchy because...
[5564.34 → 5571.34] Where are you going with that one?
[5571.34 → 5572.34] Looks going to calm down.
[5572.34 → 5573.34] Bye.
[5573.34 → 5574.34] I guess we love that.
[5574.34 → 5575.34] I'll see you in the old 70s.
[5575.34 → 5596.34] I know a bit more Marks and loaf hippo memes with his function.
[5596.34 → 5599.34] No Hero style for the games.
