[0.00 → 2.00] Oh my god!
[2.00 → 3.00] Wow!
[3.00 → 4.00] Oh wow!
[4.00 → 6.00] You should have done this as Miley!
[6.00 → 8.00] I should have done Miley Cyrus!
[8.00 → 10.00] The resemblance is striking!
[10.00 → 11.00] That's ridiculous!
[11.00 → 12.00] Hold on!
[12.00 → 13.00] She should get a beard!
[13.00 → 15.00] Like seriously!
[17.00 → 18.00] Wow!
[18.00 → 20.00] Are you going to call your mom on after Friday?
[20.00 → 22.00] I don't know if that was her.
[22.00 → 23.00] Oh.
[23.00 → 24.00] I'm assuming.
[24.00 → 25.00] I'm assuming too, but I don't know.
[25.00 → 28.00] It's usually your mom when anyone calls you, and I'm next to you.
[28.00 → 29.00] During when?
[29.00 → 30.00] I was.
[30.00 → 31.00] Here.
[31.00 → 32.00] Okay.
[32.00 → 33.00] Oh no.
[33.00 → 35.00] It looked like a good thing.
[35.00 → 37.00] She was congratulating you on something.
[37.00 → 38.00] Oh, you're calling her.
[38.00 → 39.00] Yeah.
[39.00 → 40.00] Oh good.
[40.00 → 41.00] Yeah.
[41.00 → 46.00] Am I the only person who puts my parents into my phone as their actual first names?
[46.00 → 47.00] Maybe.
[47.00 → 49.00] We should do a straw poll.
[49.00 → 50.00] My mom's mom.
[50.00 → 51.00] Oh, hello.
[51.00 → 52.00] Hey.
[52.00 → 53.00] Hello.
[53.00 → 57.00] Hi, I was just phoning to congratulate you guys on another one.
[57.00 → 61.00] I'm going to congratulate you guys on an amazing year for Lion's Tech Tips.
[61.00 → 62.00] Oh, thank you.
[62.00 → 64.00] And, uh, amazing year, really.
[64.00 → 69.00] And, uh, hope you have a great Christmas, and have a great New Year, and you guys are
[69.00 → 72.00] doing awesome, and I hope you have an even better year next year.
[72.00 → 73.00] Well, that was super nice.
[73.00 → 74.00] Woo!
[74.00 → 75.00] Aw, thank you!
[75.00 → 76.00] Thanks, Mom.
[76.00 → 77.00] Yep, you guys deserve it.
[77.00 → 78.00] You've done amazingly well.
[78.00 → 79.00] Yay.
[79.00 → 80.00] Yay.
[80.00 → 81.00] Thank you!
[81.00 → 82.00] Thank you again, Mom.
[82.00 → 83.00] Alrighty, bye-bye.
[83.00 → 84.00] Bye, Mom.
[84.00 → 85.00] Bye!
[85.00 → 86.00] Bye!
[86.00 → 87.00] Bye!
[87.00 → 88.00] Bye!
[88.00 → 89.00] Bye!
[89.00 → 92.00] Well, that wasn't what I thought it was.
[92.00 → 96.00] No, I thought she was going to give me heck for something.
[96.00 → 97.00] Cause half the-you know-
[97.00 → 100.00] Me too, but like, knowing her, she probably agreed with pretty much everything that we said.
[100.00 → 102.00] It's like a conditioning thing, though.
[102.00 → 107.00] If one-tenth of the time your mom calls, I'm going to get burned.
[108.00 → 112.00] Then I'm going to be afraid of the burn every time she calls.
[112.00 → 113.00] Yeah.
[113.00 → 115.00] Because she hasn't burned you that often.
[115.00 → 117.00] No, she hasn't burned me that often.
[117.00 → 119.00] I think it was like just the first call, really.
[119.00 → 124.00] No, she's burned me a couple of times, because she, uh, every time you leave the country,
[124.00 → 126.00] I can expect a call from her burning me.
[126.00 → 128.00] She never got you for the Europe one.
[128.00 → 130.00] Yeah, she did.
[130.00 → 131.00] Really?
[131.00 → 132.00] Yeah!
[132.00 → 134.00] She said something like, if he returns in bad shape-
[134.00 → 135.00] Yeah!
[135.00 → 136.00] But she didn't call you after.
[136.00 → 137.00] I don't think she called you after.
[137.00 → 140.00] Did she call meno, she called me before you left, though, I think.
[140.00 → 141.00] Before, not after.
[141.00 → 142.00] Well, that still counts.
[142.00 → 143.00] No!
[143.00 → 144.00] No!
[144.00 → 146.00] Are you kidding me?
[146.00 → 148.00] Miley Cyrus doesn't think it counts.
[148.00 → 150.00] That was-that is actually-
[150.00 → 151.00] That was crazy.
[151.00 → 152.00] That was spooky.
[152.00 → 153.00] Like, I think it's- I think it's going away now.
[153.00 → 155.00] Yeah, because you have to have the wave.
[155.00 → 156.00] Yeah.
[156.00 → 159.00] It's like, does the light-coloured sort of wave off to the side?
[159.00 → 161.00] Yeah, it has to be more to the-more to the side.
[161.00 → 162.00] Yeah.
[162.00 → 163.00] Like, I don't- I don't actually know.
[163.00 → 165.00] That was just spooky.
[165.00 → 169.00] Right when-right when the wig came off, it was pretty much-right?
[169.00 → 171.00] I'm basically Miley Cyrus.
[171.00 → 173.00] You're basically Miley Cyrus.
[173.00 → 174.00] Okay, so there you go.
[174.00 → 176.00] We have our results from our poll here.
[176.00 → 189.00] So, 58% of voters have their parents under mom and dad, and 28% have them under their first names, with a 14% coming in as a- with a potato as their answer.
[189.00 → 190.00] So, thank you.
[190.00 → 192.00] Thank you to the potato voters.
[192.00 → 196.00] So, Luke's got-Luke's got all these pictures of Miley loaded up here.
[196.00 → 202.00] It is amazing how different the photoshopped pictures look compared to-
[202.00 → 203.00] Yeah.
[203.00 → 205.00] What she actually looks like.
[205.00 → 206.00] Yeah.
[206.00 → 210.00] The whole, like, glam-glam doll Hollywood thing.
[210.00 → 213.00] Wow, she wears some pretty out their outfits.
[213.00 → 219.00] I don't really follow Miley Cyrus, so I'm- I'm like- I'm having my Miley shock.
[219.00 → 220.00] There it is!
[220.00 → 221.00] I kinda did it again.
[221.00 → 222.00] Wow.
[222.00 → 225.00] I just needed, like, a wrecking ball.
[225.00 → 228.00] And you need your tongue, like- or, like, all over the place.
[228.00 → 231.00] I don't know how to do it. How-doesn't she-
[231.00 → 234.00] I don't know, she opens her mouth and picks out her tongue a lot.
[234.00 → 235.00] Wow.
[235.00 → 236.00] Just wow.
[236.00 → 238.00] Lipstick tastes really gross.
[238.00 → 240.00] I don't know how anyone deals with this.
[240.00 → 242.00] Like, I like the taste of food.
[242.00 → 244.00] Why would you ever do that to yourself?
[244.00 → 245.00] Oh!
[245.00 → 247.00] Alright, I have to kick this habit.
[247.00 → 248.00] Oh!
[248.00 → 251.00] You've wanted to say that the whole time.
[251.00 → 253.00] You waited so long!
[253.00 → 254.00] Oh, man.
[254.00 → 255.00] Oh!
[255.00 → 259.00] Okay, I have to take off my belt here.
[259.00 → 262.00] That's why the nuns have the belt.
[262.00 → 264.00] So that they have the-the whip.
[264.00 → 265.00] Oh, wow.
[265.00 → 266.00] Okay.
[266.00 → 267.00] Okay.
[267.00 → 268.00] Okay.
[268.00 → 269.00] Okay.
[269.00 → 271.00] Am I going to take off the-
[271.00 → 278.00] I- I- I- I- I almost had something come over me and I almost started apologizing to my father for making twerking videos when he started trying to whip me.
[278.00 → 279.00] Did she apologize?
[279.00 → 280.00] I don't know.
[280.00 → 281.00] I don't think so.
[281.00 → 285.00] Didn't she like get dispossessed or emancipated or whatever the thing is for that?
[285.00 → 286.00] I don't think so.
[286.00 → 287.00] I don't think so.
[287.00 → 288.00] I don't think so.
[288.00 → 289.00] Oh, I'm sweating.
[289.00 → 291.00] At this point, I don't know if she really cares.
[291.00 → 292.00] Oh!
[292.00 → 293.00] That was really uncomfortable.
[293.00 → 298.00] The habit is just-it's kind of like a loose tube-tube dress.
[298.00 → 302.00] Like it's- you can't even move your legs apart or anything.
[302.00 → 305.00] They just get stuck on the- because it can't-
[305.00 → 307.00] I can't imagine how that could possibly be comfortable.
[307.00 → 311.00] No, it does't- well, I'm sure they have higher quality than like costume-
[311.00 → 312.00] The costume one.
[312.00 → 313.00] Yeah.
[313.00 → 314.00] The top down the road raid habits.
[314.00 → 316.00] My Cyrus hair is going away.
[316.00 → 317.00] Yeah, that's okay.
[317.00 → 322.00] Your Cyrus body left you a long time ago so no one's too concerned about the hair.
[322.00 → 323.00] Whoa!
[323.00 → 324.00] Whoa!
[324.00 → 327.00] Did you tell people about your bra?
[327.00 → 328.00] My bra?
[328.00 → 329.00] Whoa!
[329.00 → 330.00] Shhh!
[330.00 → 331.00] What's wrong with you?
[331.00 → 333.00] It's a secret.
[333.00 → 336.00] I didn't say anything.
[336.00 → 341.00] Well, don't miss-
[341.00 → 345.00] This week's episode of Channel Super Fun, okay?
[345.00 → 346.00] Let's just say that.
[346.00 → 349.00] We did like a super vague thing earlier.
[349.00 → 350.00] Yeah, it's okay.
[350.00 → 352.00] He had no way of knowing that that was going to be a secret.
[352.00 → 354.00] You're supposed to know everything.
[355.00 → 356.00] Is he?
[356.00 → 357.00] Yes.
[357.00 → 358.00] Is Nick supposed to know everything?
[358.00 → 359.00] Nope.
[359.00 → 360.00] Is that fair?
[360.00 → 361.00] Is that fair to Nick?
[361.00 → 362.00] Doesn't matter.
[362.00 → 363.00] Is that-
[363.00 → 365.00] Is that fair to-
[365.00 → 367.00] Right when the camera goes off,
[367.00 → 370.00] Nick, you're supposed to know everything!
[370.00 → 371.00] I just see it.
[371.00 → 374.00] People are like, wow, that's a teaser!
[374.00 → 377.00] And no, I'm not wearing a bra under the nun costume.
[377.00 → 379.00] Am I allowed to show this much skin on Twitch TV?
[379.00 → 380.00] I don't know.
[380.00 → 381.00] Who knows?
[381.00 → 382.00] Is that like-
[382.00 → 386.00] Well, you showed Miley Cyrus pictures, so I think we just lost anyway.
[386.00 → 390.00] Cause like, if you show a picture of her, there's probably too much being shown.
[390.00 → 391.00] As far as I could tell.
[391.00 → 393.00] There's like, what is that line even from?
[393.00 → 395.00] Oh yeah, I pulled the sleeves up.
[395.00 → 402.00] You know, I have to wonder, you know, if legit Hollywood celebrities, like someone like Miley,
[402.00 → 407.00] started streaming on Twitch with their cleavage hanging out, would Twitch pull her down?
[407.00 → 411.00] Or would there be different rules for Miley Cyrus?
[411.00 → 413.00] Depends on how many viewers she brought in.
[413.00 → 415.00] Yeah, does it depend on how many viewers she brought in?
[415.00 → 416.00] Yeah, I'm sure it does.
[416.00 → 419.00] Would you watch Miley Cyrus play video games just as a curiosity?
[419.00 → 420.00] Like, not for a long time.
[420.00 → 423.00] Like, would you- if you heard, like, Miley is streaming on Twitch.
[423.00 → 425.00] I'd probably tune in to make sure that someone wasn't lying.
[426.00 → 427.00] You would be curious.
[427.00 → 428.00] Yes.
[428.00 → 429.00] So you would-
[429.00 → 430.00] I'd be like, bull crap!
[430.00 → 432.00] And then I'd click on it and be like, oh, she is, and leave.
[432.00 → 433.00] She is, and leave.
[433.00 → 435.00] She's so boring after like five minutes because streaming is already boring.
[435.00 → 437.00] Well, I don't- I don't- yeah, I don't even really watch streams.
[439.00 → 441.00] What if she was like, really entertaining?
[442.00 → 444.00] I don't- I don't- I don't know.
[445.00 → 447.00] I haven't really found anyone that I like watching.
[447.00 → 448.00] Like, okay.
[448.00 → 452.00] If she happened to- if I actually liked it, then sure, because I would watch someone if I actually liked it.
[452.00 → 458.00] So you-you tune into the stream, and she is like, 360 no-scopes some dude, like, right as you drop in, okay?
[458.00 → 460.00] I don't care about that.
[460.00 → 461.00] Okay, well, whatever.
[461.00 → 462.00] She does something impressive.
[462.00 → 463.00] Something impressive.
[463.00 → 466.00] She does something impressive, and then-okay, okay, okay, hear, hear.
[466.00 → 468.00] This is- this is actually-this is an interesting topic.
[468.00 → 470.00] So, so she's got like legit-
[470.00 → 471.00] Well, we're talking about me, so-
[471.00 → 473.00] She's got legit skill, okay?
[473.00 → 474.00] And-
[474.00 → 475.00] I'm both people in this conversation.
[475.00 → 476.00] Thank you.
[476.00 → 485.00] Um, so she's got legit skill, but- but she's doing the whole like degrading to women and debasing
[485.00 → 492.00] streaming as- as- as a legitimate form of content thing with like, herself hanging out all over the place.
[492.00 → 495.00] Do you support it by leaving your stream tuned into it?
[495.00 → 496.00] I-
[496.00 → 504.00] Or do you tune out on the principle of that people shouldn't be just trying to attract attention by how they look on Twitch streams?
[504.00 → 517.00] If- is there wasn't an- it's small, mind you, but if there wasn't a group of males on Twitch that do the exact same thing, I would probably care more.
[517.00 → 527.00] Now it's- it's small, but there are dudes on Twitch that get viewers, uh, because of how they dress up and what they wear and what they look like.
[527.00 → 528.00] It's a thing.
[528.00 → 539.00] Um, people don't talk about it because there's a much larger male population that is streaming on Twitch, and most of them aren't doing that.
[539.00 → 540.00] But it is a thing.
[540.00 → 543.00] Um, so, yeah.
[543.00 → 548.00] Yeah, and there are a lot of dudes that take off their shirts on stream and get more people watching because of it.
[548.00 → 549.00] Yes, but they're not allowed to do that anymore.
[549.00 → 550.00] And-
[550.00 → 551.00] Yeah.
[551.00 → 552.00] And rightly so.
[552.00 → 557.00] And because of that, there are dudes that have worn more revealing clothes, the exact same strategy that girls did.
[557.00 → 562.00] So like, this is a both sides' argument, so I don't know if that necessarily applies.
[562.00 → 568.00] It's really weird because you've completely transformed, but you still have really crazy long eyelashes, which is hilarious.
[568.00 → 573.00] Um, and the-what was the other part? Degrading to women?
[573.00 → 574.00] They're degrading to anyone.
[574.00 → 576.00] I would say more like debasing the medium.
[576.00 → 582.00] Like, taking it from being about game streaming and turning it into being about hanging your boobs or your six-pack out there.
[582.00 → 583.00] Right, again.
[583.00 → 584.00] Let's say that.
[584.00 → 586.00] Because I would say it's degrading to men to do it too.
[586.00 → 587.00] I'm not saying that it's a double-spin.
[587.00 → 589.00] Yes, all I was trying to say is that it's- there are both sides.
[589.00 → 592.00] Miley's a woman, so that's specifically what we're talking about.
[592.00 → 593.00] Sure, yeah.
[593.00 → 595.00] I- I don't know if I would support that.
[595.00 → 600.00] I don't also know if I would care, because that's one of the reasons why I'm not really into watching Twitch streams as well,
[600.00 → 603.00] is I don't care who's- I don't care about your little camera box.
[603.00 → 605.00] Mmm, so you're just strictly gaming.
[605.00 → 606.00] Yeah.
[606.00 → 610.00] If someone's doing really well, or especially if someone's trying to show something, like I like speed runners.
[610.00 → 611.00] Yeah.
[611.00 → 614.00] That is Twitch streams that I'll watch when there's like speed running competitions and stuff.
[614.00 → 615.00] Right.
[615.00 → 616.00] There's like no personality usually.
[616.00 → 621.00] Yeah, and I don't care, because I'm not like- I- ugh, I don't want to be like a jerk and say that,
[621.00 → 623.00] but that's not the medium that I'm going to want to digest this through.
[623.00 → 624.00] Right.
[624.00 → 627.00] If you make- I've watched some gaming videos on YouTube.
[627.00 → 629.00] So you want it to be more compiled and-
[629.00 → 630.00] Yeah.
[630.00 → 631.00] I'm not-
[631.00 → 632.00] Tightened up for you.
[632.00 → 633.00] Yeah, I don't know.
[633.00 → 636.00] To me, if I'm entertained, I'm not going to tune out on principle alone.
[636.00 → 640.00] Yes, no, I agree, but I'm probably not going to be entertained.
[640.00 → 641.00] Yeah.
[641.00 → 642.00] That's what I'm trying to explain.
[642.00 → 643.00] I see.
[643.00 → 644.00] By the way, my eyelashes are always this long.
[644.00 → 645.00] I'm not wearing extensions.
[645.00 → 646.00] To see-
[646.00 → 647.00] No, I know, I know.
[647.00 → 651.00] But like, because they're black from the whatever mascara stuff-
[651.00 → 652.00] Yeah, I'm wearing mascara.
[652.00 → 654.00] It makes it stand out a lot more, right?
[654.00 → 655.00] Yeah.
[655.00 → 657.00] I actually went pretty light on them.
[657.00 → 658.00] It's contrasting.
[658.00 → 663.00] My sister did makeup on me when I was like 12.
[663.00 → 665.00] Like, I lost a bet or something.
[665.00 → 666.00] Sure, yeah.
[666.00 → 667.00] Like, it's one of those things.
[667.00 → 668.00] I have an older sister.
[668.00 → 671.00] I probably- if you have an older sister, you know what?
[671.00 → 672.00] We're going to straw pull this.
[672.00 → 673.00] Yeah.
[673.00 → 674.00] Okay.
[674.00 → 675.00] I don't, but like, it makes sense.
[675.00 → 676.00] Who cares?
[676.00 → 680.00] At some point or another, it's very likely if you have an older sister that you ended up
[680.00 → 682.00] being a makeup dummy at some point.
[682.00 → 685.00] So if you have an older sister-
[685.00 → 686.00] Luke, did you lose a bet?
[686.00 → 688.00] Did you get made up at some point?
[688.00 → 689.00] No.
[689.00 → 690.00] I never have.
[690.00 → 691.00] Richard.
[691.00 → 696.00] Let's go yes, no, and then, okay.
[696.00 → 697.00] I want to hear from you guys.
[697.00 → 698.00] But, yeah.
[698.00 → 704.00] She would always tell me that- and like, she did me up with like really heavy eye makeup
[704.00 → 705.00] once.
[705.00 → 712.00] And it's like, if someone showed me those smoldering eyes, I'd be like-
[712.00 → 713.00] You're trying to do so.
[713.00 → 715.00] And like, not the rest of the-it was weird.
[715.00 → 717.00] It was actually kind of weird.
[717.00 → 721.00] Like, the eyes popped, and I was like, nope, no.
[721.00 → 724.00] Nope, nope, nope, I'm out.
[724.00 → 725.00] That's it.
[725.00 → 726.00] Nope, done.
[726.00 → 727.00] This goes-
[727.00 → 728.00] You noted the hell out of there?
[728.00 → 733.00] This goes way beyond like, you know, outside your sexual preference.
[733.00 → 736.00] This goes way beyond like incest.
[736.00 → 737.00] It's yourself.
[737.00 → 739.00] Isn't there something called-there's a name for that.
[739.00 → 741.00] There's probably a name for anything.
[741.00 → 742.00] Ah, yes.
[742.00 → 745.00] Where he looked in the reflection on the water and fell in love with himself.
[745.00 → 746.00] Yeah.
[746.00 → 747.00] And like, his whole life just fell apart.
[747.00 → 748.00] Yeah.
[748.00 → 753.00] Alright, so the vast majority of you are saying shortcake.
[753.00 → 754.00] I saw this on the side.
[754.00 → 755.00] This is new.
[755.00 → 756.00] No, I don't think so.
[756.00 → 757.00] Really?
[757.00 → 758.00] Yeah.
[758.00 → 760.00] I've literally never noticed that before.
[760.00 → 762.00] Yeah, Luke likes the pie chart.
[762.00 → 763.00] Yeah, it's kind of cool.
[763.00 → 768.00] But it looks like we've got about a 50-50 split between the people who legitimately answered
[768.00 → 769.00] and people saying yes or no.
[769.00 → 770.00] So it looks like older sisters-
[770.00 → 774.00] We've also seen our straw polls are maybe not the most accurate thing ever.
[774.00 → 775.00] You're not the most representative of-
[775.00 → 776.00] You're not the most representative of-
[776.00 → 780.00] People vote for like, what's fun instead of what actually happened.
[780.00 → 786.00] Well, we'll let you guys know if we ever really need to know what you think, but in general-
[786.00 → 787.00] I want to jump on this real quick.
[787.00 → 789.00] I've never seen a banner ad for Bell agio.
[789.00 → 791.00] It's literally just bread.
[791.00 → 792.00] What's Bell agio?
[792.00 → 793.00] It's literally just bread.
[793.00 → 795.00] Oh, mine's for the Cosmopolitan.
[795.00 → 796.00] I must know I'm going to Vegas.
[796.00 → 797.00] Yeah, really.
[797.00 → 798.00] Anyway-
[798.00 → 801.00] A little late, booked my hotel already, but good try.
[801.00 → 802.00] Note about Bell agio bread.
[802.00 → 804.00] It is made where literally everything else is made.
[804.00 → 808.00] The difference is they shoot a line of water down the middle, and then they sprinkle flour on top.
[808.00 → 809.00] He worked at a bread factory.
[809.00 → 810.00] There's no other difference.
[810.00 → 811.00] I used to make it.
[811.00 → 812.00] Legit worked at a bread factory.
[812.00 → 813.00] I used to make it.
[813.00 → 814.00] Yep.
[814.00 → 815.00] It is not special.
[815.00 → 821.00] Goes to show you, if you work at a bread factory, maybe things aren't so dismal for you in the future.
[821.00 → 823.00] Maybe you could work for Linus Media Group someday.
[823.00 → 825.00] That was what stood out to me about his resume.
[825.00 → 826.00] Bread factory.
[826.00 → 827.00] The bread factory.
[827.00 → 830.00] Oh my god.
[830.00 → 832.00] My favourite job title there was Bun Packer.
[832.00 → 834.00] Oh my god.
[834.00 → 836.00] That's where everyone starts.
[836.00 → 837.00] You start as a Bun Packer.
[837.00 → 838.00] I'm not kidding.
[838.00 → 840.00] That is 100% the official title.
[840.00 → 844.00] It is on your like, you get paid as a Bun Packer.
[844.00 → 846.00] Your official title is Bun Packer.
[846.00 → 850.00] What you do is you pick up, this is, I'm talking about automation jobs.
[850.00 → 855.00] You pick up bags of bread from one side, and you pack them into a tray.
[855.00 → 862.00] So you do this for four hours, and then you get your break, and then you do this for four hours.
[862.00 → 864.00] You don't think that can't be automated.
[864.00 → 865.00] You've got something wrong.
[865.00 → 868.00] So once after that I moved on I was no longer a Bun Packer.
[868.00 → 870.00] But yeah, that's where everybody starts.
[870.00 → 874.00] And the entire Twitch chat is exploding.
[874.00 → 877.00] Because I don't know if you've even seen that episode of South Park.
[877.00 → 878.00] Yes.
[878.00 → 879.00] Okay.
[879.00 → 883.00] The second you start working there, everyone that's worked there for a while is like,
[883.00 → 884.00] Have you seen the South Park episode?
[884.00 → 885.00] Yes.
[885.00 → 886.00] Where they talk about like...
[886.00 → 887.00] Why would they call it that?
[887.00 → 891.00] Why don't they just change it to Bun Packaging Technician?
[891.00 → 892.00] Or something.
[892.00 → 893.00] That doesn't necessarily sound better.
[893.00 → 895.00] No, it really doesn't, does it?
[895.00 → 899.00] You can't make buns and packing not sound ridiculous.
[899.00 → 900.00] Bun Transportation Technician.
[900.00 → 903.00] Bun Pre-distribution Manager.
[903.00 → 904.00] Manager.
[904.00 → 905.00] Manager.
[905.00 → 907.00] Okay, now we're overdoing it.
[907.00 → 911.00] Now, that's like, that's like receptionist versus secretary.
[911.00 → 915.00] Or like sanitation technician versus garbage collector.
[915.00 → 916.00] Yeah.
[916.00 → 917.00] Like gone off the deep end.
[917.00 → 918.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[918.00 → 920.00] So essentially it comes back to Bun Packer.
[920.00 → 921.00] Bun Packer.
[921.00 → 922.00] Yeah.
[922.00 → 923.00] Hashtag Bun Packer.
[923.00 → 924.00] We should probably have a shirt.
[924.00 → 925.00] Bun Packer.
[925.00 → 926.00] Hashtag Bun Packer.
[926.00 → 931.00] Just have like an empty tray with like the dotted outlines around it and then bags of buns.
[931.00 → 933.00] So they go in there.
[933.00 → 934.00] Bun Packer.
[934.00 → 935.00] Bun Packer.
[936.00 → 937.00] Alright.
[937.00 → 938.00] So...
[938.00 → 939.00] Right, yes.
[939.00 → 941.00] Anyone tuning into the stream...
[944.00 → 949.00] Not only are we only in partial makeup now, I'm still a little bit Miley Cyrus.
[949.00 → 950.00] Yeah.
[950.00 → 952.00] I think we're done here.
[952.00 → 955.00] Can someone get a screenshot of right when I had taken my wig off?
[955.00 → 956.00] Probably.
[956.00 → 957.00] Definitely where it was the best.
[957.00 → 958.00] Yeah, it'll be on the Twitch archive.
[958.00 → 960.00] We don't upload the after party, but it'll be on the Twitch archive.
[960.00 → 961.00] I'm sure.
[961.00 → 962.00] Because we'll put that in the memes thread on the forum.
[962.00 → 965.00] Maybe Jack sack will do a Luke Miley drawing.
[965.00 → 968.00] I was expecting Jack sack might do one of both of us.
[968.00 → 969.00] I'm sure he will.
[969.00 → 970.00] Good old Jack sack.
[970.00 → 971.00] I was...
[971.00 → 973.00] Yeah, I didn't see it posted.
[973.00 → 974.00] Obviously I wasn't watching it.
[974.00 → 975.00] Big...
[975.00 → 977.00] Big bra says, dude I'm so high I'm confused.
[977.00 → 984.00] I was talking to someone about Interstellar, and they were like, imagine someone watched Interstellar
[984.00 → 985.00] while high on something.
[985.00 → 987.00] And I was like, seriously?
[987.00 → 989.00] Imagine how many people just left the theatre.
[989.00 → 991.00] Because it's like it's already just screws with your head.
[991.00 → 992.00] Right.
[992.00 → 996.00] And if you are messed in some way, that's got to just be the most ridiculous...
[996.00 → 997.00] I haven't seen it.
[997.00 → 998.00] How was it?
[998.00 → 999.00] I liked it.
[999.00 → 1003.00] The way I talked to Taryn about this, because I talked to Taryn about space things, is when
[1003.00 → 1009.00] you go and watch it, you have to be ready to switch on and off throughout the movie.
[1009.00 → 1011.00] It's not a movie where you go, and you turn your brain off.
[1011.00 → 1012.00] Right.
[1012.00 → 1014.00] It's not a movie where you go, and you make sure you're paying attention with your brain
[1014.00 → 1015.00] on all the time.
[1015.00 → 1016.00] See that bugs me.
[1016.00 → 1017.00] It does.
[1017.00 → 1018.00] A lot.
[1018.00 → 1019.00] But it's doable.
[1019.00 → 1020.00] Yeah.
[1020.00 → 1021.00] And it's pretty discerning.
[1021.00 → 1023.00] Like you can tell, okay that is obviously over sensationalized.
[1023.00 → 1026.00] And then the next part you can tell like, okay that was probably supposed to be digested.
[1026.00 → 1033.00] Because for me, it's all about maintaining the rules of your, of your, of like maintaining
[1033.00 → 1037.00] the believability within the confines of the universe you've created.
[1037.00 → 1038.00] They do okay with that.
[1038.00 → 1043.00] The problem is that they're, they're, one of the locations is the earth and a lot of
[1043.00 → 1044.00] times when you do that...
[1044.00 → 1045.00] You should be really careful with spoilers.
[1045.00 → 1046.00] I am...
[1046.00 → 1047.00] Okay, yeah.
[1047.00 → 1048.00] Guys don't worry, no spoilers.
[1048.00 → 1049.00] It's, it's interstellar.
[1049.00 → 1051.00] Obviously there are more locations than just the earth.
[1051.00 → 1054.00] One of the obviously one of the main locations is the earth.
[1054.00 → 1057.00] Whenever you do that, you're relating to real world physics and stuff, right?
[1057.00 → 1058.00] Right.
[1058.00 → 1064.00] So they, they do break out of the idea that it's probably not necessarily 100% all the
[1064.00 → 1065.00] physics that we have now.
[1065.00 → 1069.00] But, one thing to keep in mind is that people like Neil deGrasse Tyson have come out and
[1069.00 → 1072.00] said the science on it is like an 8 or 9 out of 10.
[1072.00 → 1073.00] Right.
[1073.00 → 1075.00] The problems with it is the oversensation.
[1075.00 → 1080.00] Because they'll, they'll take something and take it too far to make it more exciting.
[1080.00 → 1084.00] Like if something had happened, it will happen, but then it'll be glamorized.
[1084.00 → 1086.00] Like it'll be more drastic.
[1086.00 → 1087.00] Right.
[1087.00 → 1088.00] More aggressive.
[1088.00 → 1089.00] Hollywood.
[1089.00 → 1090.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1090.00 → 1095.00] But the ideas of everything that could possibly happen is probably right, at least to a certain
[1095.00 → 1096.00] degree.
[1096.00 → 1098.00] They just made it more visibly appealing.
[1098.00 → 1101.00] It's kind of like when it, when the movie says based on a true story.
[1101.00 → 1103.00] Actually, someone, someone brought up Apollo 13.
[1103.00 → 1109.00] Like why Apollo 13 was such a great movie was because it was, it kind of stuck to, stuck
[1109.00 → 1111.00] to what actually happened.
[1111.00 → 1114.00] And that's, okay, maybe that's a bad example of based on a true story.
[1114.00 → 1119.00] Because to my understanding, they actually did a perfect job of, of, of keeping things,
[1119.00 → 1121.00] uh, uh, pretty true to, to the actual events.
[1121.00 → 1124.00] So what, what, what else would I compare it to?
[1124.00 → 1126.00] Any, okay.
[1126.00 → 1132.00] Any sports, any sports movie ever where it's very dramatized and sort of the, the struggle
[1132.00 → 1135.00] that the person goes through, and they did would have gone through a struggle, but it's
[1135.00 → 1139.00] going to be designed and, and it's going to be more intense, cut up to, to jerk it your,
[1139.00 → 1142.00] your heartstrings, pull your heartstrings and jerk it your tears.
[1142.00 → 1144.00] Um, like they'll, they'll take scenarios.
[1144.00 → 1147.00] Like I'm, I'm going to do this without spoilers, but it's going to be fairly difficult.
[1147.00 → 1150.00] They'll take a scenario where, yes, Tom Hanks is amazing.
[1150.00 → 1151.00] Sorry, carry on.
[1151.00 → 1154.00] Like there is some impending doom of some sort.
[1154.00 → 1156.00] I'm trying to be as vague as possible.
[1156.00 → 1164.00] Um, and instead of it being like probably somewhat mild and to a certain degree avoidable,
[1164.00 → 1169.00] they'll make it so that it's very aggressive and not avoidable.
[1169.00 → 1171.00] That's basically all I'm going to go to.
[1171.00 → 1174.00] So like it, it would have happened regardless.
[1174.00 → 1175.00] Right.
[1175.00 → 1179.00] They're just changing slight properties about it, but they're not changing the fact that it happened.
[1179.00 → 1180.00] If they're not changing.
[1180.00 → 1183.00] They're changing outcomes more than the circumstances.
[1183.00 → 1187.00] The yeah, because things are more drastic than they should be.
[1187.00 → 1188.00] I've got.
[1188.00 → 1189.00] It's like, it's like you catalyzed everything.
[1189.00 → 1190.00] Right.
[1190.00 → 1192.00] I've got people asking why I'm wearing the Spurs.
[1192.00 → 1194.00] I forgot my Sennheiser's at home.
[1194.00 → 1196.00] I almost never forget my headphones.
[1196.00 → 1197.00] I wear them to sleep.
[1197.00 → 1201.00] So I wake up next to them and I grab them as I get out of bed every morning.
[1201.00 → 1202.00] Yeah.
[1202.00 → 1203.00] Um, but yeah, no, I don't have them today.
[1203.00 → 1204.00] So I needed something to wear.
[1204.00 → 1205.00] These are quite comfortable.
[1205.00 → 1208.00] That's what I really like about the SE 215s.
[1208.00 → 1209.00] The comfort is outstanding.
[1209.00 → 1211.00] The connectors are kind of pretty good.
[1211.00 → 1212.00] Oh my God.
[1212.00 → 1214.00] I've heard they used to be better.
[1214.00 → 1215.00] Wow.
[1215.00 → 1216.00] That's awful.
[1216.00 → 1219.00] Are you going to send that to me so that I can share it?
[1219.00 → 1220.00] Oh man.
[1220.00 → 1222.00] Send it on, uh, here?
[1222.00 → 1223.00] Yeah.
[1223.00 → 1224.00] Yeah.
[1224.00 → 1225.00] I got this.
[1225.00 → 1229.00] Someone just said Luke, check this out in the chat, and usually I don't click on those,
[1229.00 → 1231.00] but I thought it might've been the screenshot.
[1231.00 → 1232.00] Yeah.
[1232.00 → 1234.00] It's not the screenshot, but it's still pretty good.
[1234.00 → 1235.00] Yeah.
[1239.00 → 1241.00] I don't even know what to say.
[1241.00 → 1242.00] Why do we even do this show?
[1246.00 → 1248.00] Some days I really wonder.
[1248.00 → 1250.00] That was epic.
[1250.00 → 1251.00] All right.
[1251.00 → 1255.00] Well, we'll see you guys next week.
[1255.00 → 1256.00] Thanks for tuning in.
[1256.00 → 1257.00] Thanks for tuning in.
