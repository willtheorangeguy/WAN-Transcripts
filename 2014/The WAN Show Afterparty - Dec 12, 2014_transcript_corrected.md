[0.00 → 2.18] There's, that's really difficult to do.
[2.48 → 3.08] Yeah, it is.
[3.30 → 7.78] Yeah, well, the way that I had originally, like, the way I would have wanted to do it
[7.78 → 10.26] was me as Kyle and him as Paul.
[10.38 → 11.06] I'm going to open the window.
[11.08 → 13.86] I was kind of wondering why it wasn't the other way around.
[14.12 → 19.48] The reason is that, um, it's so warm.
[19.48 → 22.02] It's hard to, yeah, that thing's going to actually, whoa.
[22.82 → 27.38] Ah, I'm connected to, like, his leg with my headphone.
[27.98 → 29.30] And then he just pitched water everywhere.
[29.30 → 29.88] Oh!
[33.08 → 33.94] There we go.
[34.40 → 35.32] Too much fun.
[35.90 → 38.42] Um, so the reason we did it this way, oh, look at this.
[38.60 → 43.72] I knocked over a paper towel thing right next to the water that I also knocked over.
[44.10 → 44.84] That's funny.
[46.10 → 54.06] Um, is Luke had more facial hair in a pattern that was easier to do Kyle's facial hair with.
[54.12 → 55.40] But Paul has facial hair.
[55.40 → 62.14] Yeah, but we, okay, our makeup artist was hoping that my stubble would actually resemble stubble.
[62.48 → 62.82] Oh.
[63.42 → 66.84] And you can't even tell, but I haven't shaved in three days.
[67.72 → 68.32] You, really?
[68.32 → 69.32] Yeah.
[69.32 → 73.42] I'm not a super hairy dude.
[73.42 → 75.22] You look completely cleanly shaven.
[75.22 → 79.12] Except for my wonderful goatee, right?
[79.12 → 83.06] When we were going to makeup, I was like, oh, like, to transform into Paul, I'm just going
[83.06 → 89.44] to have to, like, get my hair smaller somehow and wear glasses or something.
[89.44 → 90.96] Like, there's not much to do.
[91.04 → 92.52] And then she's like, we're making you Kyle.
[92.62 → 93.28] I was like, what?
[93.98 → 94.42] Okay.
[95.94 → 96.96] This is going to be difficult.
[97.04 → 98.14] And do you see the hangout's question?
[98.94 → 101.62] Oh, well, this is a very sombre.
[101.86 → 102.08] What?
[102.14 → 102.50] What happened?
[102.68 → 104.26] Um, this is a very sombre topic.
[104.36 → 108.98] Do you want to ask Megan to come in and start DE-de-polifying us?
[108.98 → 112.62] Um, so this was posted on the Corsair blog.
[112.94 → 118.20] I actually, I knew about this already, but I wasn't really sure how much, how much privacy
[118.20 → 119.80] the family wanted.
[120.20 → 122.88] Um, yeah, I heard about this the other day.
[123.06 → 127.76] Mike, Mike Clements, aka Yellow beard from Corsair has passed away.
[128.38 → 128.78] Oh, no.
[129.20 → 135.24] Yeah, he apparently, he apparently took a nap and, uh, and didn't wake up completely unexpected.
[135.24 → 137.60] He was a freaking awesome guy.
[137.60 → 143.34] Like, as awesome as he was on every forum that ever existed and as a member of
[143.34 → 148.10] so many communities, um, he was, he was 10 times more awesome in person.
[148.46 → 151.96] Um, I had the my first ever business trip.
[152.58 → 155.20] Um, I had the pleasure of, of meeting him.
[155.20 → 162.08] Uh, NCI sent me to Fragapalooza as like a brand ambassador type thing with, uh, with Corsair.
[162.20 → 164.36] I was, I was set up in the Corsair booth there.
[164.36 → 171.60] And, um, Mike was, Mike was there rapping Corsair and just doing community interaction
[171.60 → 172.70] the way that he did.
[172.92 → 176.56] And we'd stayed in touch very infrequently over the years.
[176.64 → 180.06] I mean, that was back in 2006, but, but we'd been in touch since then.
[180.06 → 184.28] And anytime I needed help with anything, um, he was, he was right there.
[184.28 → 186.76] And, uh, yeah, really, really great guy.
[187.08 → 190.58] And, um, that is, that is a real shame.
[190.76 → 192.70] So I'm just, I'll bring that up on my screen.
[192.90 → 195.70] He's been around since like I started doing stuff at all.
[195.96 → 199.46] I remember seeing yellow beard posts like right when I first started going to hardware
[199.46 → 200.64] forum this way back in the day.
[200.78 → 201.08] Yep.
[201.08 → 207.42] So, um, yeah, he, he, he was a huge part of Corsair social media efforts.
[207.76 → 214.90] So as, as awesome, as awesome as, you know, Corsair is in terms of their, their community
[214.90 → 219.66] interaction, he was a huge part of making that actually happen on a, on a daily basis.
[219.66 → 222.92] So, um, oh, I'm cutting off the picture of him.
[222.92 → 224.92] So that's Mike, great guy.
[224.92 → 228.68] And, uh, so that happened on December 10th during the late, late evening.
[229.18 → 229.92] So, oh wow.
[229.96 → 232.56] I guess I heard about it basically, basically right away.
[232.62 → 235.74] But yeah, I didn't, I didn't really want to say too much because I didn't want to create
[235.74 → 240.86] a bunch of social media buzz about something that, you know, they hadn't had time to, to
[240.86 → 241.84] digest it all yet.
[241.84 → 246.42] So, um, welcome to the after party, I guess.
[247.70 → 248.18] Yeah.
[248.80 → 251.54] The sad fur party.
[251.92 → 252.26] Yeah.
[252.72 → 253.56] Sad fur party.
[253.56 → 255.44] Apparently you have to go.
[255.72 → 257.50] Oh, I have to go to makeup.
[257.52 → 259.22] She has to like to take some stuff off.
[259.48 → 260.84] Should I just try to remove it?
[261.04 → 262.56] Do you guys want me to try to remove it?
[262.58 → 263.06] It's a good idea.
[263.52 → 264.68] You don't think it's a good idea?
[264.82 → 265.02] No.
[265.20 → 267.90] Did I ever not do something because you didn't think it was a good idea?
[267.90 → 268.12] Well, you probably rip it.
[268.92 → 273.66] It's, it's possible that might be an expensive thing, and she might want to remove it without
[273.66 → 274.18] ripping it.
[274.60 → 276.38] It's medical, medical adhesive?
[276.66 → 276.92] Yes.
[277.38 → 281.02] Is, is, is there, is the bald cap the part that, like, is it valuable?
[281.02 → 282.02] Can I damage it?
[283.56 → 285.18] She says don't do it.
[285.18 → 286.12] She says don't do it?
[287.32 → 289.72] Is it going to damage the cap or just lions?
[290.22 → 291.44] You just lose some skin.
[291.64 → 292.76] It's like maybe a little skin.
[293.10 → 294.34] You're only risking yourself.
[294.48 → 296.04] I'm only risking myself, apparently.
[296.36 → 296.62] Okay.
[296.72 → 301.78] Well, so, so, so as a bit of a pick me up, do you guys want to, do you guys want me to do
[301.78 → 301.86] it?
[301.90 → 302.80] Don't do it.
[302.80 → 303.34] I don't know.
[303.38 → 304.60] Twitch chat says I should do it.
[304.60 → 307.12] Of course, Twitch chat says you should do it.
[307.12 → 308.40] That's the, the voice of reason.
[308.40 → 309.52] Twitch chat is the worst thing to listen to.
[309.52 → 309.80] Okay.
[310.08 → 312.98] Well, first, do we want to get a closer look at it first at least?
[313.36 → 313.80] Oh God.
[313.80 → 314.38] So, uh.
[314.62 → 315.62] It's going to go out of focus.
[316.14 → 317.30] So, no, no, it's not too bad, actually.
[317.40 → 320.68] The aperture is pretty, okay, so you guys can kind of see how it works here.
[320.94 → 322.36] And I told her the back didn't really matter.
[322.48 → 326.66] So you can see the back's, uh, the back's not as clean as, uh, as the top here.
[326.66 → 331.42] But you can see kind of how it works is you, you, you cut it to shape and then you, you
[331.42 → 332.28] blend the colours.
[332.50 → 337.82] So she did the most work at the front where you can see the colour of the skin is basically
[337.82 → 340.44] right into the bald, the bald cap.
[340.54 → 342.10] You, you pretty much can't tell the difference.
[342.80 → 347.26] I, I'm kind of tempted to like to go home like this and see if I can convince my wife that
[347.26 → 348.96] I, because she, she wouldn't have watched WAN show.
[349.22 → 351.78] But you wouldn't be able to get it off.
[351.86 → 352.44] Remove it then.
[352.82 → 352.98] Yeah.
[352.98 → 353.22] Right.
[353.74 → 354.08] Okay.
[354.08 → 357.12] So, uh, is she telling me I shouldn't do it?
[357.80 → 358.76] She's, she's, she's wrong.
[358.86 → 360.40] Should I rip it open from the top?
[360.50 → 362.00] What are you doing?
[362.58 → 365.50] I, what does Twitch chat say?
[365.62 → 367.90] Oh my gosh, this is the worst idea.
[368.38 → 368.78] Okay.
[368.84 → 369.12] Okay.
[369.22 → 369.46] Okay.
[369.52 → 369.96] Here we go.
[370.32 → 370.82] Here we go.
[371.12 → 375.36] Can, oh wait, can I get, can I at least get like a picture to commemorate my looking like,
[375.84 → 378.26] like Paul, something that will likely never happen again?
[378.28 → 379.32] Just like Paul.
[379.94 → 382.44] Well, yeah, but video's not as high quality as a picture.
[382.44 → 384.90] Well, it's Instagram for.
[385.10 → 387.36] So, Instagram for Android, so.
[388.48 → 389.28] It'd be lower quality.
[389.30 → 391.60] Can you do one in the other thing, landscape?
[391.72 → 392.00] Wow, you're really needy.
[392.30 → 393.36] Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
[397.10 → 399.88] What's Paul's, what's Paul's pose that he does with the glasses?
[400.62 → 401.52] The glasses are like.
[401.52 → 401.58] My pose?
[401.58 → 403.34] Stuck to the side of my head.
[403.60 → 404.56] Like your profile picture.
[405.36 → 405.52] Oh.
[407.04 → 407.48] Whoa.
[408.48 → 409.04] Oh yeah.
[409.34 → 409.82] Oh, okay.
[410.16 → 411.06] That's the good stuff.
[412.04 → 412.36] That sounded.
[412.36 → 414.56] Like they're like hanging off your face like this or something.
[414.56 → 417.84] Oh, oh, that's, wow.
[418.02 → 419.50] I haven't, I haven't used that picture.
[420.62 → 422.30] I haven't used that picture anywhere else.
[422.60 → 423.96] It's just on Skype, I think.
[424.04 → 425.52] So I don't think anyone else has seen that picture.
[425.94 → 426.42] All right.
[426.68 → 428.86] So anyway, this was the side that was better.
[428.94 → 433.24] I can't see when I'm showing you guys this side, but it's funny because halfway through
[433.24 → 437.34] when she realized that she had an hour less time than she wanted, I was like, oh yeah,
[437.54 → 441.02] and the right side is more important because that's the side that I'll turn to look at Luke
[441.02 → 441.24] from.
[441.58 → 445.42] And she's like, uh, okay, because the left side is way better right now.
[445.46 → 448.98] I'm like, oh, well, people are going to freak out if we sit on the wrong side of the couch.
[448.98 → 451.52] She's like, uh, okay, I'll try.
[452.06 → 456.24] And then like after like three minutes, she's like, I don't have enough time.
[456.38 → 458.34] These, these things are not blah, blah, blah, blah.
[458.36 → 459.98] I'm like, okay, Luke and I'll switch places.
[459.98 → 461.80] And so, so, uh, okay.
[462.08 → 462.34] Okay.
[463.24 → 464.22] Okay, here we go.
[464.28 → 464.58] Here we go.
[464.62 → 464.96] Here we go.
[467.32 → 469.32] Oh, oh.
[469.32 → 475.70] Oh, no.
[475.70 → 478.98] Oh, Geez.
[480.26 → 481.34] That kind of worked out.
[481.66 → 483.36] Your head is so red now.
[483.52 → 484.42] Does that hurt?
[484.98 → 486.48] Like, no, actually, it didn't really hurt.
[486.92 → 489.32] This, it looks like your skin peeled off.
[489.50 → 489.98] Yeah.
[490.60 → 492.70] Because there's no makeup there anymore.
[492.70 → 493.16] Oh, man.
[493.16 → 494.88] So it looks like there's a layer of skin because of the makeup.
[495.48 → 498.92] I didn't even realize how sweaty I was under that thing.
[499.06 → 499.24] Yeah.
[499.24 → 500.42] Holy crap.
[500.76 → 501.74] I don't breathe very well.
[501.76 → 502.08] You know what?
[502.12 → 502.38] Ah.
[502.76 → 505.56] You look like, you still look like a completely different person because of the goatee.
[505.72 → 506.02] Really?
[506.16 → 507.30] Does it make that much of a difference?
[507.58 → 508.44] Well, seriously, you do.
[508.44 → 509.64] Do you wear that goatee every day?
[510.00 → 514.34] It's like that South Park episode where the evil versions of all the characters just have
[514.34 → 514.78] goatees.
[514.90 → 516.34] You could pull that off, though.
[516.60 → 518.66] Like, it looks like a different person, but you could pull that off.
[518.66 → 519.46] It's like a different person.
[519.46 → 520.26] It looks like a different person.
[520.26 → 520.94] It looks like a different person.
[520.94 → 521.80] It looks like a different person.
[521.80 → 522.80] You know what?
[522.80 → 523.14] I don't think I can do DJ Polly D.
[523.14 → 524.24] You know what the worst part is?
[524.30 → 527.26] I look like potentially more of a douchebag just like this.
[529.04 → 530.52] Like, it doesn't look better.
[531.08 → 533.20] It's more comfortable, but it's still ridiculous.
[533.58 → 535.22] She darkened your face, didn't she?
[535.48 → 535.80] Yes.
[536.12 → 536.64] You're dark.
[536.64 → 539.76] So I have like a lot of...
[539.76 → 540.70] It's not fake tan.
[540.82 → 542.62] It's makeup, but it looks like fake tan.
[542.84 → 545.74] And then my beard's been colour changed like crazy.
[546.22 → 548.26] You know what's funny is it's...
[548.26 → 551.18] There are certain things...
[551.18 → 553.60] I don't know how to approach this topic.
[554.02 → 559.66] There are certain colours of skin that would be politically incorrect to change yourself
[559.66 → 561.62] to for the purpose of a show.
[561.82 → 565.78] But for some reason, like, Permian, like Kyle, isn't one of them.
[565.78 → 567.42] So it's okay to do that.
[567.58 → 570.14] Like, and I'm not saying it's any more or less okay.
[570.28 → 574.62] I'm just saying that for some reason it is socially acceptable to the point where no one
[574.62 → 578.98] calls Luke out for being darker than usual to be made up as someone.
[579.32 → 584.70] But if we were to do the WAN show as, let's say, I don't know, Austin and Marcus or something,
[585.54 → 587.92] there would be a huge stigma around that.
[587.98 → 588.44] And it's just...
[588.44 → 592.16] It's very mysterious to me how some things are okay and others are not.
[592.16 → 596.34] And I'm not going to get into the topic of whether the whole thing is or isn't okay.
[596.48 → 597.64] That is not my...
[597.64 → 599.16] That's not the subject of this show.
[599.32 → 600.08] It's just interesting.
[600.18 → 601.20] It's just fascinating.
[601.50 → 602.84] The fact that it is that way is interesting.
[602.90 → 605.90] The fact that it is that way is interesting to me.
[606.12 → 609.06] So is there anything else that needs to be removed or did I pretty much take care of it?
[609.16 → 611.94] Apparently your beard is going to be difficult to get the colour out of.
[611.94 → 613.52] All right.
[613.64 → 615.16] So you can piece.
[615.38 → 618.24] That's like my least favourite part of the whole situation.
[618.98 → 620.42] Is it just like a long shower?
[620.64 → 622.12] No, you're DJ Pauline D, not the situation.
[622.70 → 624.70] Oh, is one of them called the situation?
[625.22 → 626.82] Linus racist confirmed.
[627.44 → 628.28] Oh my God.
[628.28 → 628.30] Of course.
[628.30 → 630.48] That was the most neutral way you could have possibly said that.
[630.48 → 633.58] Luke, thank you for not knowing who the situation is, by the way.
[634.14 → 634.72] No problem.
[634.80 → 635.84] Who the situation is?
[636.10 → 636.94] I don't know who the situation is.
[637.36 → 638.56] You don't either, I don't think, right?
[638.74 → 639.20] Do you know who...
[639.20 → 639.64] Yeah, no.
[639.82 → 640.72] It was from that show.
[640.72 → 641.28] Is that a person?
[641.36 → 642.32] Jersey Shore show.
[642.82 → 643.22] Oh.
[643.50 → 646.42] I would much rather not know who that was.
[646.56 → 647.54] No, that's...
[647.54 → 649.66] People who watched that show should be sad.
[650.08 → 652.30] No, you don't have to watch this show.
[652.44 → 654.12] It's one of those things that's shoved in your face.
[654.16 → 657.56] And even if you hate and despise the show, you still are aware of these things.
[657.56 → 659.94] No, Jersey Shore was not a big deal here.
[660.18 → 660.58] Good.
[661.26 → 662.26] Well, I never...
[662.26 → 663.62] I knew people that cared about it.
[663.94 → 664.24] Okay.
[664.82 → 666.02] You're fairly sheltered.
[666.28 → 668.00] We've already talked about it too much.
[668.08 → 668.10] Oh.
[668.22 → 669.12] We should move on.
[669.12 → 669.92] We need to...
[669.92 → 670.86] No more talking about it.
[670.86 → 671.74] I'm okay with moving on.
[672.14 → 672.28] Okay.
[672.48 → 673.42] So, you know what?
[673.50 → 674.00] You know what?
[674.00 → 674.72] You're probably right.
[674.82 → 676.12] Because I've actually never even...
[676.12 → 679.86] I've never even seen a one-second snippet of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
[680.08 → 680.92] I haven't either.
[681.22 → 682.24] I've never...
[682.24 → 683.80] I've never come across...
[683.80 → 685.16] I know people who watch it.
[685.28 → 687.02] So that's the only reason I've ever seen it.
[687.16 → 687.46] Right.
[688.90 → 689.16] Who?
[691.04 → 691.42] Later.
[691.86 → 692.18] Yeah.
[692.18 → 693.74] But like, what the hell?
[693.86 → 694.82] I don't know if I want to know...
[694.82 → 696.08] Yeah, I could do the whole...
[696.08 → 696.36] Is it?
[696.36 → 698.38] I could do the whole goatee thing if I could grow one.
[698.54 → 698.92] You could...
[698.92 → 699.72] Yeah, no, I think...
[699.72 → 701.86] I have never seen you with one before, obviously.
[702.00 → 702.82] I could get away with it.
[703.36 → 703.96] What do you think, Paul?
[703.98 → 705.48] Is it just like a long shower to get the beard out?
[705.48 → 710.48] I think because you have a fairly skinny face, it does give you that...
[710.48 → 711.12] That's pretty cool.
[712.32 → 715.92] It's like you're a bad guy in the 20s or something like that.
[716.04 → 716.48] If you had...
[716.48 → 717.08] If you had...
[717.08 → 722.38] I would want to put you in a zoot suit with one of those flat-ridden hats or something like
[722.38 → 722.56] that.
[722.56 → 722.66] Yes!
[722.66 → 723.56] And I think you could...
[723.56 → 724.30] I think that...
[724.30 → 725.34] I want to go get your...
[725.34 → 726.46] Where is my hat?
[726.50 → 727.40] Oh, you're going to help me.
[727.46 → 727.96] Okay, yes.
[728.06 → 729.80] I'm actually going to bail out and get that done.
[730.00 → 730.48] Peace, bro.
[730.58 → 733.98] I was thinking I'm just going to have to smother my face and elbow.
[733.98 → 734.70] That's why I always like...
[734.70 → 736.04] Oh, do you want your momentums?
[736.96 → 737.68] Sure, yeah.
[738.34 → 738.72] All right.
[739.02 → 743.96] I'm probably not going to do too much more in terms of after-party here unless Paul has
[743.96 → 745.32] something in particular to discuss.
[745.42 → 745.52] Right.
[745.82 → 748.70] Wasn't I just going to ask, like, how are things going for you in general?
[748.82 → 750.42] And I was like, oh, we should do this on the after-party.
[751.18 → 751.92] You should.
[752.54 → 754.36] You know, topics come up.
[754.42 → 754.98] We discuss them.
[756.06 → 756.82] Yeah, how are you doing?
[757.76 → 758.58] I'm doing great.
[758.58 → 764.64] I mean, I'm enjoying my individuality and my freedom.
[765.24 → 766.02] And all that kind of thing.
[766.48 → 766.62] Right.
[766.80 → 773.26] I've been working on a website and getting some shirts going and stuff like that, although
[773.26 → 774.36] they're not quite ready yet.
[774.82 → 775.92] What's going to be on your website?
[777.26 → 779.82] Not really a lot to begin with.
[779.86 → 785.42] It's just going to be kind of a home base and a link to where you could, like, see videos
[785.42 → 786.96] or whatever and probably my Twitter feed.
[787.38 → 791.54] Just some simple stuff, but I think kind of the basics that I need to get going.
[791.88 → 792.80] Are you using Squarespace?
[793.72 → 794.66] Are you using my Facebook?
[795.66 → 796.10] No.
[796.70 → 797.10] No.
[797.10 → 798.10] I have a...
[798.10 → 800.10] I have...
[800.10 → 803.18] It's a different company called IX Web Hosting.
[803.38 → 803.62] Okay.
[804.00 → 804.40] Yeah.
[804.88 → 807.66] It's working good so far.
[808.56 → 809.00] Awesome.
[809.56 → 810.86] What kind of t-shirts are you going to have?
[811.86 → 817.26] I'm going with the same guy who Logan works with, Vermont Green.
[817.88 → 819.48] So I just...
[819.48 → 823.36] Right now I just actually have a logo that just got finished this week.
[823.68 → 824.52] Can we see it?
[824.52 → 831.10] I don't have it right now, but I'm going to be revealing it hopefully soon.
[831.16 → 833.98] I have some, like, design work and stuff to do, which I'm not really...
[833.98 → 835.10] I don't do all that much with.
[835.64 → 840.34] So I'm hoping I can get through it quickly, but we'll see how things go.
[840.66 → 842.28] I mean, I am...
[842.28 → 847.00] I kind of have a list in my head of things that I need to do, and I kind of chip away
[847.00 → 850.00] at it a little bit each day, but I'm not...
[850.00 → 852.00] I'm not...
[852.00 → 854.00] I don't like...
[854.70 → 857.82] I guess what I'm saying is I'm not quite as diligent a worker as you are, Linus.
[857.94 → 859.82] I think that's what it comes down to.
[860.16 → 861.48] You mean you have some sanity.
[862.00 → 862.78] A little bit.
[863.16 → 865.54] I'm not as diligent a worker as some people think.
[865.60 → 871.10] I just have a large staff that helps me get things done, because if it wasn't for my team,
[871.18 → 872.92] I wouldn't stand a chance.
[873.32 → 873.50] Oh.
[873.72 → 877.76] Well, you wouldn't stand a chance of making, what, like, nine videos a week or whatever.
[877.88 → 878.06] Yeah.
[878.54 → 878.90] Impossible.
[879.48 → 879.94] That's ambitious.
[881.00 → 881.28] Yeah.
[881.86 → 882.58] So...
[882.58 → 884.60] But yeah, but you're enjoying the freedom.
[884.70 → 889.22] Are you ever tempted to kind of run back into the arms of gainful employment?
[890.48 → 892.86] No, at this point, not really.
[893.72 → 901.16] I'm going to continue to do the one-day-awake thing at New egg for the foreseeable future,
[901.48 → 903.14] at least a little bit into 2015.
[903.14 → 909.40] So that's a good way of kind of balancing out the having feeling like I have a real job
[909.40 → 911.54] or a place to go other than being at home all the time.
[913.14 → 915.86] But yeah, so that's working out.
[915.92 → 917.76] I'm getting CES plans up and running.
[917.76 → 919.40] I think New egg action.
[919.40 → 919.42] Ooh, good.
[919.90 → 920.12] Yeah.
[920.12 → 921.74] So I will be at CES.
[921.98 → 922.52] I've heard...
[922.52 → 923.38] Are you going this year?
[923.78 → 925.88] Yeah, we're going to have the whole team, even this guy.
[926.26 → 926.58] Wow.
[926.58 → 926.90] Woo!
[927.12 → 927.44] Excellent.
[928.04 → 929.34] Yeah, it's going to be awesome.
[930.10 → 935.54] I think I'm going to be hanging out with the Tech Syndicate guys a bit, and I'm pretty
[935.54 → 937.00] sure Kyle's going to be there.
[937.66 → 939.26] And yeah, we're going to be running around for the week.
[939.60 → 944.90] I'm only planning, like, as far as my channel goes, to do maybe, like, four videos.
[945.14 → 946.94] I'm not planning on, like, knocking out too much.
[947.20 → 949.80] I'm actually sort of...
[949.80 → 951.72] I can be very contrary a lot of the time.
[951.72 → 957.42] So having done CES with New egg for, I don't know, three or four years now, I'm kind of
[957.42 → 963.30] like, I'm going to just try to enjoy my time there this year and actually, like, wander
[963.30 → 968.62] the floor a little bit and just find things that look interesting and go over and check
[968.62 → 968.98] them out.
[969.04 → 969.72] It's like, I always feel...
[970.26 → 973.84] Like, last year at CES, I did not go on the show floor at all.
[974.00 → 974.36] The whole time...
[974.36 → 975.64] I was just scheduled for...
[975.64 → 976.14] All suites.
[976.14 → 977.20] ...sweets and stuff the whole time.
[977.20 → 979.34] So I think that'll be kind of nice.
[979.34 → 982.14] And it'll be interesting to be there.
[982.38 → 983.82] The show floor is...
[983.82 → 986.76] My first year at CES, I didn't actually...
[986.76 → 987.18] No, hold on.
[987.24 → 991.64] No, my first year, I did some of the show floor and I spent a lot of time in suites.
[991.78 → 995.22] And then my second year and third year, I think I didn't even see the show floor.
[995.64 → 998.16] This is back when I was doing product management at NCI.
[998.92 → 1001.74] And then my fourth year, I think I made some time for...
[1001.74 → 1004.28] This is, like, my seventh year at CES this year.
[1004.98 → 1009.30] I'm becoming one of those people that I'd have conversations with in my first couple years.
[1009.34 → 1011.96] Where they'd be like, yeah, I've been doing this thing for seven years.
[1012.02 → 1014.44] And I'd be like, oh my goodness, how are you even alive?
[1015.08 → 1015.84] It's awful.
[1015.96 → 1016.82] It's such a grind.
[1017.46 → 1018.02] But I'm...
[1018.02 → 1019.48] You're not doing the same thing, right?
[1019.62 → 1020.72] Like, you're doing...
[1020.72 → 1022.68] It's the same thing.
[1022.82 → 1023.70] I go to the suite.
[1024.38 → 1028.78] I go to the suite and instead of getting out of the way, being quiet when the media guy is filming,
[1029.04 → 1031.46] when I have a meeting, I'm the media guy filming.
[1031.76 → 1034.54] And I tell the guy to shut up when they're having the sales meeting.
[1035.12 → 1036.12] It's the same thing.
[1036.18 → 1037.10] I'm just on the other side.
[1037.20 → 1038.68] It's a very, very slight difference.
[1038.98 → 1039.18] Okay.
[1040.14 → 1047.20] Well, yeah, but I always enjoy CES for some reason.
[1047.34 → 1049.02] I don't know if it's just, like...
[1049.02 → 1049.74] You're not even human.
[1050.34 → 1053.58] Granted, it's been very...
[1053.58 → 1055.56] It's been a lot of hard work at times.
[1055.84 → 1057.22] But, like...
[1057.22 → 1057.62] I don't know.
[1057.72 → 1058.68] I just...
[1058.68 → 1062.50] I somehow have managed to have a pretty good time every year that I've gone.
[1063.02 → 1067.74] And not manage to feel too much like I'm just burnt out or whatever.
[1067.88 → 1070.36] I mean, by Friday, you're just like, get me the hell out of here.
[1070.66 → 1070.72] But...
[1070.72 → 1070.96] Yeah.
[1072.24 → 1074.64] Yeah, I'm looking forward to it, so...
[1074.64 → 1079.24] Well, we're planning to probably do a similar amount of content to last year.
[1079.24 → 1083.08] But we're going to have two full teams to get it done.
[1083.20 → 1087.26] So the idea is that there may be some sleep involved.
[1087.50 → 1088.60] So I'm kind of thinking...
[1088.60 → 1089.86] We're going to have three-man teams.
[1090.46 → 1093.88] And then this guy's coming along, too, for some reason.
[1094.38 → 1100.00] So the three-man teams are going to be, like, two editor-slash-shooters per team.
[1100.14 → 1101.70] And then one host per team.
[1102.08 → 1107.22] So I'll basically do, like, my 8-10 hour day of hosting things.
[1107.22 → 1111.38] And then my camera people will tag out halfway through the day.
[1111.50 → 1115.90] And then go edit the stuff that they shot during the previous segment.
[1116.10 → 1119.08] So we should be rolling content throughout each day.
[1119.26 → 1122.60] And doing, like, what people expect from us in terms of CES coverage.
[1122.60 → 1125.60] Which is, like, covering as much of the show as humanly possible.
[1126.48 → 1127.44] So that's the goal.
[1127.86 → 1128.72] That's a pretty good system.
[1128.90 → 1130.96] I'm going to tell the people at New egg TV about that.
[1131.00 → 1132.08] But I don't know what they're doing this year.
[1132.08 → 1134.36] Yeah, I was going to say, tell who at New egg TV.
[1134.54 → 1135.64] Didn't they just lose another one?
[1135.64 → 1137.02] There are a few people left.
[1137.10 → 1137.80] They lost another.
[1137.94 → 1139.32] Oh, Rachel?
[1139.76 → 1140.10] Yeah.
[1140.76 → 1142.58] Yeah, she was our writer.
[1142.78 → 1145.12] And she found another job.
[1145.22 → 1146.24] So she has moved along.
[1146.62 → 1148.04] I'm very happy for her, actually.
[1148.28 → 1151.98] She's been looking for a little bit.
[1152.04 → 1156.54] But I think the place where she's moving to is going to be a nice step-up for her.
[1157.06 → 1159.20] And she's deserved it for a while.
[1159.56 → 1160.46] Where did she go?
[1160.58 → 1160.72] Sorry.
[1160.72 → 1165.10] You know, I don't know the name of the place directly.
[1165.48 → 1168.30] She told me, she gave me kind of rundown of it in the description.
[1168.52 → 1170.98] It's not like, I don't think it's anywhere that people would recognize.
[1171.38 → 1171.60] Right.
[1171.86 → 1172.08] Cool.
[1173.12 → 1175.88] Can I ask, what's with the 2x4 on your ceiling?
[1176.28 → 1176.86] Up there?
[1177.10 → 1177.42] Yeah.
[1178.02 → 1180.14] That's my, like, framework.
[1180.42 → 1185.62] So when I moved in here, the garage had all been finished.
[1185.62 → 1188.20] So it's got insulation and drywall out here.
[1189.08 → 1193.98] But I wanted something up above because the ceiling's pretty high up.
[1194.20 → 1197.78] So as far as lights, like, I have a light over here that's kind of hung up here.
[1198.24 → 1198.82] I have a mic.
[1199.02 → 1201.38] I have a mic thing that I can bring down right above me.
[1201.54 → 1204.96] So it's just like a big kind of frame that's built up there.
[1205.04 → 1210.02] And I'm planning to, like, add more stuff to it and actually do, like, a ceiling back there
[1210.02 → 1212.32] so it doesn't look just like a 2x4 behind me.
[1212.32 → 1218.48] I also normally wouldn't look like this, but my webcam is attached to the other side of
[1218.48 → 1221.60] the frame up there to do top-down shooting of, like, builds and stuff.
[1222.02 → 1222.10] Right.
[1222.28 → 1225.54] And so this is just my built-in laptop webcam.
[1226.90 → 1227.50] Tell me something.
[1227.90 → 1228.48] Yeah, that's better.
[1229.30 → 1232.26] What's the first position you would hire for your YouTube channel?
[1232.26 → 1241.06] The first, the thing that I would need the most help with, the thing that takes up the
[1241.06 → 1243.86] most of my time is editing, I think.
[1244.10 → 1248.26] So I would probably look into getting somebody to do editing for me.
[1249.06 → 1252.42] There are other things that I think I could look at.
[1252.42 → 1259.64] But honestly, right now I'm trying to build a regular system where I can be self-sustaining
[1259.64 → 1265.10] and kind of see what, you know, like where my income is as far as, like, where I'm able
[1265.10 → 1267.70] to generate money just to pay the bills and whatnot.
[1268.16 → 1274.42] And then if from there it looks like I'm going to have a little bit of breathing room to expand
[1274.42 → 1277.50] beyond that, I might look into doing more.
[1277.50 → 1278.32] But I don't know.
[1279.42 → 1281.92] I'm not sure if I want to go the larger team.
[1284.94 → 1286.06] Oh, he died.
[1291.58 → 1296.22] I think he's going for rhombus.
[1298.14 → 1298.58] Rhombus.
[1299.90 → 1300.44] All right.
[1300.56 → 1302.88] I think we lost our connection to Paul, unfortunately.
[1302.88 → 1306.86] That's the thing about internet people is sometimes they freeze.
[1308.96 → 1312.10] People on the internet, they freeze because internet connections are...
[1312.10 → 1313.06] Oh, now he's looking at different...
[1313.06 → 1313.84] Oh, is he back?
[1314.10 → 1314.42] You back?
[1314.54 → 1314.98] You back, Paul?
[1316.14 → 1319.14] I've been able to hear you guys perfectly fine this whole time.
[1319.32 → 1320.00] I don't know what's going on.
[1320.68 → 1321.32] Am I back?
[1321.32 → 1322.06] She's like, what's this line is doing?
[1322.86 → 1324.02] Yeah, you're back.
[1324.18 → 1325.38] I got a piece, though.
[1325.42 → 1327.66] I got to get this glue sort of worked on.
[1327.86 → 1329.30] Actually, I don't think there's much left on me.
[1329.34 → 1330.76] I think there's just a little on the back of my neck.
[1330.76 → 1331.24] You're right.
[1331.36 → 1332.78] Just rub it against the...
[1332.78 → 1333.92] Yeah, it came off pretty clean.
[1334.76 → 1335.24] No, no.
[1335.34 → 1336.72] I will get help.
[1336.80 → 1337.18] I'm just saying.
[1337.28 → 1338.34] I don't think there's much left.
[1338.96 → 1341.48] But thanks for joining us today, Paul.
[1341.50 → 1342.22] Thanks for inviting me.
[1342.30 → 1342.90] No problem.
[1343.26 → 1344.08] I'm being Paul 1.
[1345.00 → 1345.78] You can be Paul 2.
[1345.80 → 1346.16] I'm no longer Paul 1.
[1346.60 → 1347.62] No, I'm Paul...
[1347.62 → 1348.08] Oh, right.
[1348.12 → 1349.54] I guess my wig is gone.
[1349.76 → 1352.00] What if I'm just Paul and you're Paul 1?
[1353.04 → 1354.26] Are Paul 1 and Paul A?
[1355.06 → 1356.38] What if you're Lap?
[1357.38 → 1357.78] Lap?
[1357.78 → 1358.18] Yeah.
[1359.10 → 1359.50] Backwards.
[1359.82 → 1360.66] Draw cab Paul.
[1361.20 → 1361.72] All right.
[1362.08 → 1363.58] So thanks, everyone, for watching.
[1363.80 → 1365.10] Thanks, Paul, for joining us.
[1365.38 → 1368.10] And you can find him on YouTube.com slash Paul's Hardware.
[1368.72 → 1369.46] Thanks, guys.
[1369.70 → 1370.26] See you all later.
[1370.62 → 1371.62] It's not what it sounds like.
