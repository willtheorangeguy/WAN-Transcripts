[0.00 --> 7.72]  Okay guys, welcome to the WAN show, that show every week where me and this guy are all like,
[7.72 --> 11.72]  hey, let's like make videos and put them on the internet and then maybe people will watch them.
[11.72 --> 13.28]  Let's be on time, nope.
[13.28 --> 15.36]  And then people watch them.
[15.36 --> 19.00]  And, okay, we're only four minutes late today.
[19.00 --> 21.00]  What is this?
[21.00 --> 23.00]  You gotta pause it.
[23.00 --> 25.00]  Why am I getting French ads?
[25.00 --> 27.00]  I don't know. We're in Canada.
[27.00 --> 31.00]  Hey, poor participÃ© au concours or something.
[31.00 --> 32.00]  Just pause it.
[32.00 --> 34.00]  Alright, I'm pausing it, I'm pausing it, I'm pausing it.
[34.00 --> 39.00]  Alright, so guys, we've got a great show for you today.
[39.00 --> 44.00]  First of all, we have a topic that we covered last week sitting in the call outs here.
[44.00 --> 46.00]  I'm gonna go ahead and move that.
[46.00 --> 49.00]  One Mr. Lafrenier, I believe, put that there.
[49.00 --> 50.00]  I don't remember talking about that at all.
[50.00 --> 55.00]  Well, probably because I did most of the talking, because it's the Linus show.
[55.00 --> 58.00]  But I feel like I would have had input on that. Maybe you had me doing something else.
[58.00 --> 61.00]  I'm surprised that you didn't call me out on that. It's called the WAN show.
[61.00 --> 63.00]  It's not even called the Linus show.
[63.00 --> 66.00]  I don't really care. You put your name on everything, so whatever.
[66.00 --> 69.00]  Linus Media Group! Linus Tech Tips!
[69.00 --> 72.00]  What did you want the shirt thing to be called?
[72.00 --> 79.00]  I don't remember, but I think that this conversation is heading down a path that I'm really not actually that comfortable with.
[79.00 --> 83.00]  Linus really likes hearing his name. We should just tweet him his name.
[83.00 --> 84.00]  Thank you for that.
[84.00 --> 88.00]  Please just tweet him his name. He will greatly appreciate it.
[88.00 --> 90.00]  Alright, so why don't we just... I'll retweet it.
[90.00 --> 91.00]  Why don't we move on to our topics for the day?
[91.00 --> 96.00]  Microsoft has committed once again to do more for PC gaming.
[96.00 --> 98.00]  But they actually have...
[98.00 --> 99.00]  You're spoiling me.
[99.00 --> 100.00]  I'll... yep.
[100.00 --> 101.00]  It's gonna be awesome.
[101.00 --> 102.00]  I'm stopping.
[102.00 --> 112.00]  Okay, iOS 8 is on the way. So, actually a lot of the features that they're showing off look pretty darn cool.
[112.00 --> 115.00]  Some of them are innovative, some of them are not, but...
[115.00 --> 116.00]  But still good.
[116.00 --> 120.00]  It's about par for the course for any mobile operating system update.
[120.00 --> 123.00]  Take everything that you can and add a few things.
[123.00 --> 124.00]  Exactly.
[124.00 --> 129.00]  We also have Microsoft Cortana voice control coming along the way, which should be really interesting.
[129.00 --> 133.00]  And the ASUS Phonablet desktop.
[133.00 --> 136.00]  Tablet... laptop. Phonablet... it's not a desktop.
[136.00 --> 137.00]  It's the one thing it's not.
[137.00 --> 138.00]  Right, right, right.
[138.00 --> 141.00]  ASUS's 5-in-1 PC.
[141.00 --> 143.00]  How do you make a 5-in-1 PC?
[143.00 --> 146.00]  Well, ASUS will show us.
[146.00 --> 149.00]  But, in the meantime, guys, we'll do the intro.
[149.00 --> 150.00]  Yes!
[150.00 --> 175.00]  Broken intro.
[175.00 --> 179.00]  Alright, so this is interesting.
[179.00 --> 183.00]  Our first sponsor this week is actually a group of sponsors.
[183.00 --> 193.00]  We, along with Tech Syndicate, will be participating in the world's highest elevation terrestrial LAN party.
[193.00 --> 199.00]  So, we are going to be going to the top of the highest peak in Colorado.
[199.00 --> 201.00]  And we will be taking some...
[201.00 --> 202.00]  Ah-ha-ha!
[202.00 --> 204.00]  Some ASUS gaming notebooks up there.
[204.00 --> 207.00]  They're going to be powered by Intel Core i7s.
[207.00 --> 214.00]  And we're going to have some sweet Corsair gaming peripherals, of course, featuring their RGB keyboards.
[214.00 --> 220.00]  In order to get a LAN going at 4,400 meters above sea level.
[220.00 --> 223.00]  So, there will definitely be videos about this whole thing, guys.
[223.00 --> 226.00]  Be very, very excited.
[226.00 --> 228.00]  It'll be coming sometime in about a month.
[228.00 --> 235.00]  And a huge shout out to ASUS, Corsair, and Intel for making this whole thing possible.
[235.00 --> 242.00]  Also, something that's coming a little bit more immediately is E3 coverage here on Linus Tech Tips.
[242.00 --> 245.00]  We bailed on Computex this year, as you probably noticed.
[245.00 --> 247.00]  But we'll be doing E3.
[247.00 --> 249.00]  Basically, we did Computex last year.
[249.00 --> 253.00]  It was extremely expensive and not a whole lot of people watched the content.
[253.00 --> 255.00]  So, we're going to try something a little bit different.
[255.00 --> 257.00]  We're going to do E3 instead.
[257.00 --> 271.00]  So, our gold sponsor, 4E3, is HyperX, featuring the Fury line of performance to price ratio optimized SSDs.
[271.00 --> 276.00]  As well as the Corsair RGB keyboard and NCIX.
[276.00 --> 277.00]  My bros.
[277.00 --> 278.00]  My homeboys.
[278.00 --> 279.00]  My dogs.
[279.00 --> 282.00]  Did you see that we were being featured on Newegg's product site?
[282.00 --> 283.00]  I have seen that.
[283.00 --> 284.00]  Do you saw that?
[284.00 --> 285.00]  I saw that.
[285.00 --> 293.00]  Speaking of my bros NCIX, I'm sure Newegg is so super thrilled to have the host of NCIX Tech Tips all over their site there.
[293.00 --> 294.00]  So, yeah.
[294.00 --> 295.00]  It's pretty funny.
[295.00 --> 297.00]  I hope Paul and Kyle are watching.
[297.00 --> 301.00]  They were tagged in that Twitter feed, so I know they saw it.
[301.00 --> 302.00]  It's absolutely fantastic.
[302.00 --> 304.00]  I'm sure NCIX thinks it's hilarious too.
[304.00 --> 308.00]  Oh, this is great.
[308.00 --> 310.00]  It's like you're embedding a YouTube video, so I don't know.
[310.00 --> 311.00]  Chip700 says,
[311.00 --> 316.00]  So by we're doing E3, does he mean I'm sending Slick to E3?
[316.00 --> 317.00]  Yes.
[317.00 --> 318.00]  Yes.
[322.00 --> 324.00]  We'll be doing the same kind of thing that we did at PAX East again.
[324.00 --> 329.00]  So we'll do a mix of all the hardware stuff that I can find and a few gaming videos.
[329.00 --> 330.00]  Sweet!
[330.00 --> 331.00]  Yeah, that sounds like fun.
[331.00 --> 336.00]  I mean, part of it is that we've never covered E3 in any capacity before.
[336.00 --> 337.64]  So this is more like a scouting mission.
[338.24 --> 343.00]  So if it turns out E3 is a total disaster and there's no benefit to us being there,
[343.24 --> 344.18]  then next year we won't.
[344.38 --> 345.26]  Yeah, exactly.
[345.58 --> 346.80]  So let us know.
[346.80 --> 352.54]  It's not like PAX, where I would have to actually tie him down harder than usual
[352.54 --> 354.86]  in order to keep him from going there.
[354.86 --> 357.96]  What day did I request time off for PAX Prime?
[358.10 --> 360.46]  It was when we started Linus Media Group.
[360.58 --> 362.58]  So before we actually founded the company.
[362.58 --> 365.28]  So it would have been in December of 2012.
[365.68 --> 368.48]  You asked for the time off in September of 2013.
[370.38 --> 374.50]  I think it was like the second day I started working with you before we founded the company.
[375.02 --> 378.70]  People are saying audio is actually normal for once, which is hilarious
[378.70 --> 381.48]  because I actually took out the compressor.
[381.60 --> 384.34]  We're not using a balanced output off the mixer.
[384.54 --> 387.68]  I'm going into like a crappy RCA input on something.
[388.16 --> 390.98]  We actually, we know what the problem is now.
[390.98 --> 392.90]  I know what the problem is now.
[393.02 --> 396.18]  We need an amp and then we need a couple more adapter cables
[396.18 --> 399.46]  and we're going to be able to get the audio like bang on.
[400.28 --> 403.88]  The issue is that this Juicelink amp kind of sounds like poo.
[404.20 --> 407.48]  It's the one that we use whenever we film things on the Blackmagic camera
[407.48 --> 408.78]  and everyone complains.
[409.00 --> 412.48]  So I got the levels sounding really good on this one.
[412.96 --> 416.48]  And so that, that didn't quite work though, because it just sounds kind of poopy.
[416.48 --> 420.44]  And then I tried an Objective 2, but they're not really meant to be used this way.
[420.60 --> 422.28]  So it didn't really work.
[422.66 --> 426.54]  I need balanced inputs and outputs in order for it to work properly.
[426.86 --> 428.52]  The whole chain has to be kind of the same thing.
[428.56 --> 432.22]  And then I didn't have the right XLR to quarter inch adapters and all that.
[432.26 --> 433.22]  So it just didn't quite work.
[433.32 --> 436.68]  But guys, it is definitely going to happen.
[437.12 --> 440.48]  Also, as for the white balance, I'm actually not sure.
[440.48 --> 444.58]  I think that is a bit of a, I think that is a bit of a problemo.
[445.00 --> 448.38]  But we're just going to have to go with it.
[448.46 --> 451.98]  Because welcome to the WAN show.
[453.38 --> 457.90]  Where we go live at some time that's somewhere around 4.30 and hopefully things are okay.
[458.04 --> 459.92]  And the color's wrong and the audio sucks.
[460.96 --> 461.28]  Yeah!
[463.66 --> 464.80]  Whatever, screw you guys.
[465.20 --> 466.22]  No, we love you guys.
[466.30 --> 466.92]  Please keep watching.
[467.10 --> 467.60]  Please don't leave.
[467.92 --> 468.62]  Please don't leave.
[468.62 --> 469.36]  I need you.
[470.48 --> 474.08]  Oh, speaking of the WAN show and technical difficulties.
[474.26 --> 474.62]  All right.
[474.76 --> 475.02]  Time to try this.
[475.02 --> 476.42]  How much you want to bet we get a blue screen?
[476.62 --> 477.34]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[477.36 --> 477.76]  Don't do it yet.
[477.80 --> 478.22]  Don't do it yet.
[478.36 --> 478.70]  Hold on.
[479.10 --> 479.42]  Okay.
[479.86 --> 480.80]  And hit it.
[482.56 --> 482.76]  Oh.
[482.94 --> 483.14]  What?
[483.14 --> 483.62]  That's interesting.
[486.94 --> 488.56]  That was so not expected.
[489.02 --> 489.84]  So that's probably.
[490.24 --> 491.10]  No, I get it.
[491.12 --> 491.52]  I get it.
[491.54 --> 491.98]  I get it.
[492.06 --> 492.92]  We got to add.
[493.38 --> 493.86]  Boom!
[493.94 --> 494.62]  There we go.
[494.88 --> 495.30]  All right.
[495.42 --> 496.38]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[496.38 --> 496.64]  Not yet.
[496.70 --> 496.94]  Not yet.
[498.30 --> 498.58]  Oh.
[499.38 --> 499.88]  I gotcha.
[499.88 --> 500.32]  Yeah.
[500.32 --> 500.40]  Yeah.
[500.50 --> 500.86]  No, no.
[500.94 --> 501.22]  It's fine.
[501.26 --> 501.72]  We're all good.
[501.84 --> 502.26]  We're all good.
[502.40 --> 502.68]  You're good?
[502.80 --> 503.04]  All right.
[503.08 --> 503.44]  Hit it.
[505.86 --> 506.64]  And then.
[506.88 --> 507.20]  Yes.
[507.76 --> 509.04]  Look at us in that corner over there.
[509.06 --> 509.68]  That's adorable.
[509.86 --> 511.70]  You're like a, you're like a cute little ogre.
[511.98 --> 512.26]  Aw.
[513.74 --> 515.20]  I don't have colored hair then.
[515.60 --> 516.32]  What were they called?
[516.48 --> 517.06]  Were they ogres?
[517.42 --> 517.90]  Oh, no.
[518.00 --> 518.44]  Trolls.
[518.66 --> 518.98]  Trolls.
[519.04 --> 519.38]  Oh, okay.
[519.38 --> 519.74]  No.
[519.74 --> 519.78]  No.
[519.94 --> 521.68]  If someone here was a troll, it would be me.
[521.90 --> 522.02]  So.
[523.46 --> 524.02]  All right.
[524.02 --> 528.22]  So, we may have a wireless standard coming.
[528.52 --> 528.96]  Oh, my gosh.
[528.96 --> 535.54]  That is theoretically faster than any wired standard that we can get at a consumer level.
[535.54 --> 545.60]  And I got to kind of sit here and wonder, what is the point of these faster and faster wireless standards when they never work right anyway?
[545.60 --> 556.62]  Can you please all focus your, I know that wireless is exciting and Intel had that whole thing where they're like, wireless by 20, what was it, 2016 or 2018?
[557.48 --> 559.16]  Would like replace everything or whatever.
[559.34 --> 560.56]  I don't remember what the date was.
[560.64 --> 561.90]  It was a seven gigabit per second thing.
[561.98 --> 564.76]  They want your display and your peripherals to all be wireless.
[565.08 --> 567.28]  And I'm kind of sitting there looking at that going, okay.
[567.28 --> 570.08]  So, Intel, out of one side of your mouth, you're going wireless everything.
[570.46 --> 574.40]  And out of the other side of your mouth, you're working with Apple on the Mac Pro.
[574.40 --> 577.76]  Which is like the octopus of wires.
[578.68 --> 584.40]  Well, maybe the idea is that a Mac Pro released around that time wouldn't have to be an octopus of wires.
[584.70 --> 585.14]  Hold on.
[586.08 --> 586.76]  Hold that thought.
[587.94 --> 588.96]  Wireless octopus.
[591.10 --> 592.48]  You think geek item?
[594.88 --> 597.50]  Just like randomly crawls around your desk and annoys your cat?
[597.50 --> 604.20]  You know, I was looking into it because I have a bit of an infatuation with remote control gears.
[604.40 --> 604.58]  Yeah.
[604.58 --> 604.80]  Gear.
[605.20 --> 613.50]  And as much as I am a crappy heli pilot, I'm actually, I'm, no, I'm a better plane pilot than a heli pilot, but not by much.
[614.00 --> 618.74]  And cars, I basically have never really used a decent one.
[618.80 --> 620.52]  So, I'm definitely not good with those.
[620.52 --> 622.66]  So, but I still, I love that stuff.
[622.72 --> 623.52]  I geek out over it.
[623.58 --> 628.36]  So, I was looking to see if you can get a really sweet RC submarine.
[629.80 --> 634.54]  Because I actually built one in my grade 11 technology class.
[634.54 --> 635.02]  Right, right, right.
[635.02 --> 636.14]  Like we did it as a project.
[636.14 --> 637.34]  So, we made them out of PVC.
[637.88 --> 646.30]  And then what you'd do is you'd put as much styrofoam as you need to make it neutrally buoyant once you have your motors and your wires and everything on it.
[646.42 --> 649.62]  And we actually made fully functional submarines.
[649.80 --> 651.12]  Like everyone in the class made one.
[651.12 --> 655.80]  We made our own watertight motors out of film canisters.
[656.12 --> 658.92]  It's funny because my son won't even know what a film canister is.
[659.06 --> 659.36]  Yeah, I know.
[659.54 --> 660.98]  But they're so useful for that kind of stuff.
[661.12 --> 665.60]  Out of film canisters and then wax seals with motors inside them so they stay dry.
[665.76 --> 668.50]  And they could actually move in every direction.
[668.88 --> 671.12]  So, we had XYZ axis movement.
[671.12 --> 682.12]  And the thing I didn't like about them though was that obviously some kind of a wireless transmitter that's going to be able to punch through water is going to be either non-existent or very expensive.
[682.60 --> 685.16]  So, we were stuck with a wired control.
[685.34 --> 692.24]  So, no matter how perfectly neutrally buoyant you made the thing, as it moved up in the water, there would be more weight on it.
[692.38 --> 694.00]  And as it moved down, there would be less.
[694.14 --> 696.76]  So, you would never have that perfect control of it.
[697.02 --> 697.80]  So, I was looking.
[697.94 --> 701.04]  I was just like, is there a hobbyist grade remote control?
[701.12 --> 705.62]  A submarine that you could put like a GoPro on because it's the kind of thing you'd use once.
[705.70 --> 708.20]  I was going to say the GoPro part of that would be really cool.
[708.32 --> 709.92]  You'd be like, yeah, this is cool.
[710.14 --> 711.26]  Now I'll never do it again.
[711.40 --> 712.10]  But like, whatever.
[712.26 --> 713.92]  But you can kind of go diving with it.
[713.98 --> 714.52]  Yeah, kind of.
[714.72 --> 714.90]  Yeah.
[714.98 --> 716.66]  You could go see like fish or stuff.
[716.72 --> 717.94]  You'd take it with you on vacation or whatever.
[718.12 --> 719.86]  Maybe not once, but not that often.
[720.00 --> 721.16]  But they don't really have anything.
[721.48 --> 724.18]  So, speaking of, yeah, just wireless basically not working.
[724.18 --> 729.26]  So, anyway, Huawei has tested Wi-Fi based on future standard 802.11ax
[729.26 --> 733.14]  that can hit 10.5 gigabit per second.
[733.46 --> 738.94]  So, that's about 10 times faster than what you typically get at an 802.11ac connection today.
[739.02 --> 741.18]  This was posted by QWERTY Warrior on the forum.
[742.14 --> 746.80]  The trick, the company says, is making more efficient use of the airwaves.
[747.10 --> 751.02]  Thank you for that highly technical, elaborate explanation of the trick, Huawei.
[751.02 --> 755.92]  The new technology is smarter at allocating wireless spectrum, juggling data between multiple antennas,
[756.04 --> 757.26]  and cutting back on interference.
[757.86 --> 762.14]  They don't even have to switch to ultra high frequencies to make the magic happen.
[762.22 --> 768.52]  It works at 5 gigahertz, which is great because an inherent property of those higher frequency signals
[768.52 --> 770.56]  is that the range will be shorter.
[771.10 --> 774.60]  So, it's good that we don't have to go any higher than that.
[774.60 --> 777.02]  You're still a long way from picking one of these up.
[777.10 --> 780.94]  They figure that they may hit the market sometime in 2018.
[782.14 --> 788.40]  I guess it's just frustrating because wireless is getting all these developments dumped into it,
[788.54 --> 790.66]  and we're still using gigabit wired.
[792.30 --> 792.86]  Why?
[793.70 --> 794.30]  Why?
[794.30 --> 794.86]  Why?
[795.74 --> 796.18]  Why?
[796.88 --> 798.26]  We're trying to move away from that.
[798.36 --> 800.98]  Yeah, we're trying to move away from it, but it's extremely expensive,
[800.98 --> 803.78]  and no one's really putting the effort into making it affordable.
[804.00 --> 805.66]  The cabling is not that bad.
[805.80 --> 807.24]  No, the wiring is fine.
[807.38 --> 807.64]  It's the routing.
[807.98 --> 812.86]  It's the switches and the adapters that you'll spend a ton of money on,
[812.94 --> 815.30]  and it's frustrating because you heard JJ talking about it.
[815.40 --> 816.12]  What did he say?
[816.16 --> 818.98]  It was going to add about $150 to the bomb cost of a motherboard?
[818.98 --> 820.24]  Yeah, I think he said $150, $200.
[820.24 --> 825.10]  So, if they can integrate it onto a motherboard for $150, where's my $150 nick?
[825.90 --> 829.34]  Or $165, $170, whatever the case may be.
[829.34 --> 831.62]  Like, no one's even really making an effort.
[831.74 --> 835.70]  They're content to just let it sit there as a high-end solution forever.
[836.18 --> 840.58]  And I really think that with SSDs increasing in speed the way that they are,
[840.98 --> 844.46]  looking at how NVMe, so that's the replacement for AHCI,
[844.72 --> 848.46]  the communication protocol by which the SSD communicates with your system.
[848.46 --> 852.06]  So, looking at what they can do with NVMe in terms of improving throughput
[852.06 --> 856.92]  and reducing latency, there's no reason why two PCs on the same network
[856.92 --> 860.16]  with a couple of high-speed PCI Express or M.2 SSDs
[860.16 --> 863.66]  couldn't be transferring files to each other at, like, 2 gigabytes per second.
[864.46 --> 866.46]  Like, let's do this.
[866.54 --> 867.00]  Let's do it.
[867.08 --> 868.48]  Did I say 2 gigabytes per second?
[868.56 --> 871.02]  Because what I meant to say was, like, 200 megabytes per second.
[871.26 --> 872.36]  You know, actually, a lot more than that.
[872.42 --> 873.62]  500, 600, 700.
[874.08 --> 874.94]  Not 200.
[875.12 --> 875.58]  Yeah, not...
[875.58 --> 876.46]  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[876.54 --> 876.76]  Yes.
[877.26 --> 880.08]  So, that never happened.
[880.08 --> 882.20]  There's a few numbers in there that you should ignore.
[882.34 --> 885.08]  The numbers you should be paying attention to are we could easily be doing
[885.08 --> 887.90]  500 plus megabyte per second transfers across a network,
[888.42 --> 891.22]  straight from drive to drive, which is very, very cool.
[892.30 --> 892.74]  All right.
[892.82 --> 897.82]  Now, this, this topic, this is an interesting, this is an interesting topic.
[898.48 --> 900.24]  The thing that can do all the things.
[900.38 --> 903.78]  Now, I really liked, what was it?
[903.78 --> 910.48]  The, uh, the Transformer Book Duo or Trio, the one that you could just press a button
[910.48 --> 911.46]  to switch between.
[911.98 --> 916.72]  And where the, where the Android and Windows operating systems were actually running off
[916.72 --> 917.96]  of the same drive.
[918.08 --> 918.18]  Yeah.
[918.18 --> 919.30]  Like, it was more like a dual boot.
[919.74 --> 922.54]  This is a little bit different, my friends.
[922.68 --> 925.36]  So, the Transformer Book V or 5.
[925.88 --> 927.56]  I'm assuming, let's say 5?
[927.72 --> 928.44]  Pretty sure 5.
[928.58 --> 928.90]  Okay.
[929.10 --> 930.52]  It's a 5 in 1.
[930.52 --> 941.50]  It's an Android tablet, an Android smartphone, a Windows tablet, a Windows laptop, and something,
[941.60 --> 945.48]  a Windows phone, Android, Windows, what the hell is this thing?
[945.68 --> 947.50]  So, basically, it's everything.
[947.68 --> 951.42]  You can, you, what you do is, I'm gonna, here, I'm gonna blow up this picture off,
[951.48 --> 952.82]  uh, from Gizmodo a little bit here.
[952.84 --> 956.24]  Yeah, you can, you can click the phone in the back, and you can click the screen to the keyboard.
[956.24 --> 956.64]  Yes.
[956.74 --> 961.62]  So, much like previous Transformers, there is a hard drive down here in the keyboard,
[961.76 --> 964.48]  because there's only an SSD up here in the tablet piece.
[964.64 --> 969.56]  You've also got an extended battery in the tablet, I believe.
[969.84 --> 973.62]  So, the phone has, you know what, here, I'm just gonna go, I'm gonna go back to my, uh,
[973.68 --> 975.24]  to my cheat sheet for this thing here.
[975.70 --> 976.80]  So, yeah.
[976.80 --> 982.42]  So, there's a 2500 milliamp hour battery in the phone, and then a 4000 some odd milliamp hour battery
[982.42 --> 986.68]  in the tablet, I believe, unless that's in the keyboard.
[986.94 --> 988.42]  This is the most confusing thing ever.
[988.56 --> 993.78]  The point is, the phone has a 1080p screen, and actually, um, a pretty high-end spec,
[993.86 --> 995.10]  as far as phones are concerned.
[995.20 --> 1000.38]  And then the tablet is a 12 and a half inch IPS display, and everything kind of slots into everything.
[1000.38 --> 1007.28]  The tablet itself doesn't have Android running off of it, that's actually gonna run off of the phone hardware.
[1008.02 --> 1014.28]  So, it's a Windows laptop and an Android phone, essentially, that can just, like, slowly come together.
[1014.86 --> 1018.40]  Yeah, this thing is, like, freaking bizarro, though.
[1018.42 --> 1019.54]  It's kind of cool.
[1019.54 --> 1030.28]  I am less on board with this one than I am with the, uh, the last one that we looked at, to be perfectly honest.
[1030.46 --> 1031.76]  I, I just...
[1031.76 --> 1033.74]  But didn't they get booted out of that for some reason?
[1033.88 --> 1038.50]  Yes, but that was such an elegant solution, because you had one set of hardware.
[1038.50 --> 1043.84]  So, on the same Atom processor, you could run your Android OS or your Windows OS,
[1043.96 --> 1046.48]  and you could switch between them in, like, three or four Steamboats.
[1046.48 --> 1053.34]  Whereas this one, you can switch between them, but it's more like using one as a display,
[1053.46 --> 1054.86]  off of which the other one's running.
[1054.98 --> 1057.90]  They're not actually running on the same hardware.
[1058.06 --> 1064.66]  So, it's an Intel Atom CPU in the tablet, and then it's a, uh, Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 or something like that
[1064.66 --> 1066.28]  in the other piece.
[1066.28 --> 1071.74]  So, my notes for this one actually aren't that, uh, aren't that complete.
[1071.74 --> 1079.80]  And, of course, Ctrl-F doesn't work in Internet Explorer, because I'm a genius, and I'm using Internet Explorer.
[1080.26 --> 1083.28]  Everyone rips on you about that, like, every single show.
[1083.36 --> 1084.16]  I don't think it's listed.
[1084.78 --> 1085.60]  Yeah, it's not listed.
[1085.70 --> 1089.78]  I was, I was looking at a couple of different articles where it has a little bit more information than the Gizmodo one,
[1089.78 --> 1092.54]  so that would explain why I can't find it.
[1094.10 --> 1097.70]  So, tell me, guys, it's, in terms of device convergence,
[1098.92 --> 1104.42]  would you want a, a, a, a, a dummy device like this?
[1104.50 --> 1105.74]  Something that, uh...
[1105.74 --> 1110.14]  I think, I think if it makes sense financially, I could see myself doing it.
[1111.18 --> 1116.84]  Like, if I wanted all these things, and for some reason had to refresh them all at the exact same time,
[1117.06 --> 1117.78]  which is weird,
[1118.62 --> 1123.34]  and it, like, made sense financially, then I could see myself spending money on it,
[1123.40 --> 1125.86]  if it's actually a good device.
[1125.96 --> 1127.36]  I think we'd have to use it first.
[1127.36 --> 1129.76]  And this is going to be something that I'd definitely want to see in the store,
[1129.94 --> 1131.18]  if I was a random consumer.
[1131.18 --> 1135.28]  Because I'd want to, like, actually try clicking it in,
[1135.34 --> 1137.94]  and make sure that the phone is not just going to, like, fall out of the back.
[1139.04 --> 1141.32]  And other things like that, that I would want to try.
[1142.32 --> 1142.80]  I don't know.
[1143.48 --> 1144.44]  Okay, so here we go.
[1144.50 --> 1146.28]  We've got a summary from Asus up now.
[1146.70 --> 1151.02]  So, it is, ahem, a Windows notebook, a Windows tablet,
[1151.02 --> 1156.12]  an Android phone, an Android tablet, and an Android laptop.
[1156.70 --> 1159.74]  So, that is how the whole thing works.
[1159.74 --> 1165.12]  And the detachable Android smartphone is detachable.
[1165.22 --> 1169.76]  So, that's the piece that is not, not Windows phone at all.
[1170.34 --> 1171.66]  So, this is interesting.
[1171.80 --> 1173.82]  Okay, okay, here, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[1173.88 --> 1176.46]  So, it wasn't a Qualcomm chip on the, ah, on the phone.
[1176.56 --> 1178.32]  That's actually, that's actually very interesting.
[1178.58 --> 1181.00]  So, it is an Atom quad core on the phone,
[1181.12 --> 1187.42]  and then it is a next-gen core processor on the notebook slash tablet piece itself.
[1187.42 --> 1190.92]  So, this gives us a much better rundown of the overall specs.
[1191.14 --> 1191.16]  Yeah.
[1191.24 --> 1196.12]  So, 64, up to 64 gigs on the phone, up to 128 gigs on the tablet,
[1196.42 --> 1200.04]  with the 1 terabyte one being detachable in the keyboard.
[1200.40 --> 1201.38]  There we go.
[1201.50 --> 1202.54]  Much more clear.
[1202.92 --> 1206.18]  Maybe next time we should go to the manufacturer's site in the first place.
[1206.18 --> 1211.74]  I really hope we get a unit of this, because I'd definitely be interested in checking it out and giving it a shot.
[1212.64 --> 1215.62]  I should probably let them know that we'd be interested in checking it out.
[1216.60 --> 1218.96]  Speaking of things that we're interested in checking out,
[1219.14 --> 1224.48]  Asus has been doing their pad phones, so phones made by Asus, Android phones,
[1224.48 --> 1226.60]  for a while in other markets.
[1226.82 --> 1230.76]  Taiwan, in particular, you've been able to get a pad phone for like a couple of years now.
[1230.78 --> 1231.48]  For a while, yeah.
[1231.70 --> 1235.12]  It gets covered in the North American media a little bit,
[1235.36 --> 1237.98]  but understandably not much, because they haven't been available here.
[1238.22 --> 1240.40]  But, it's finally coming.
[1241.00 --> 1244.80]  So, this is probably where I got that Snapdragon thing that was sitting in my head,
[1244.86 --> 1247.62]  because this one does use a Snapdragon 800 processor.
[1247.62 --> 1249.86]  But, basically, it's a high-end phone.
[1249.96 --> 1252.52]  It's going to be $200 with a contract.
[1253.18 --> 1256.66]  And, we are definitely getting a unit for review.
[1256.88 --> 1260.06]  So, it's got a 5-inch screen, 1920x12...
[1260.06 --> 1261.02]  Wait, hold on a second.
[1261.40 --> 1261.80]  Right, sorry.
[1261.90 --> 1262.38]  This one...
[1262.38 --> 1263.54]  No wonder I was confused.
[1263.64 --> 1266.06]  This one's a phone, and it docks to a tablet.
[1266.28 --> 1269.06]  But, in this one, the tablet is just a dummy.
[1269.86 --> 1270.08]  Yeah.
[1270.24 --> 1271.82]  It's basically just a screen.
[1272.12 --> 1273.54]  Except that it also has...
[1273.54 --> 1275.04]  And there's no keyboard, and it's probably cheaper.
[1275.04 --> 1275.36]  Yeah.
[1275.36 --> 1278.54]  So, this one is a 2300 mAh battery in the phone,
[1278.70 --> 1281.40]  and a 4990 mAh battery in the tablet.
[1281.60 --> 1282.92]  So, you put them together, and what do you got?
[1282.98 --> 1283.80]  Bibbidi-bobbidi-bop.
[1283.94 --> 1284.54]  Bigger battery.
[1287.30 --> 1287.82]  Fascinating.
[1288.86 --> 1291.48]  I mean, okay, we need to create a straw poll for this or something.
[1291.56 --> 1292.64]  Can you get a straw poll going?
[1293.08 --> 1298.98]  So, are you interested in a phone that merges with a tablet?
[1299.82 --> 1302.48]  And, guys, give us your thoughts on Twitter as well.
[1302.48 --> 1303.66]  Just hit me at LinusTech.
[1303.72 --> 1305.06]  We're going to do a Twitter blitz on this.
[1305.06 --> 1306.52]  What would you need to see?
[1306.64 --> 1312.18]  So, between the notebook that has an Android operating system and a Windows operating system
[1312.18 --> 1316.60]  running on two completely separate pieces of hardware, and it's like notebook slash tablet
[1316.60 --> 1323.26]  slash detachable phone, versus the Padphone X, which is a phone with like a tablet dock that
[1323.26 --> 1324.52]  the phone goes into.
[1325.38 --> 1327.52]  So, anyway, the phone has a 1080p screen.
[1327.58 --> 1328.90]  The tablet's got a 9-inch screen.
[1329.02 --> 1330.20]  The whole thing runs Android.
[1330.32 --> 1336.20]  They're claiming up to 10 hours of battery life for video playback, and what an interesting
[1336.20 --> 1336.56]  device.
[1336.66 --> 1338.80]  I'm actually really looking forward to checking this out.
[1338.86 --> 1341.98]  Results so far are extremely even at 51% and 49%.
[1342.52 --> 1343.08]  Wow.
[1343.08 --> 1345.90]  I think this is the most even poll we've ever had.
[1346.56 --> 1347.70]  Holy balls.
[1348.94 --> 1349.24]  Okay.
[1349.36 --> 1350.74]  Well, we'll give you guys the results of that.
[1350.78 --> 1352.94]  If you can IM that over to me, then I'll check it out in a moment.
[1353.10 --> 1356.92]  But, guys, we've got some pictures here that I want to put up on the screen from the Engadget
[1356.92 --> 1358.60]  article about the Padphone X.
[1359.00 --> 1363.28]  So, here's the way that the phone, and as you can see, it'll be on the AT&T network.
[1363.50 --> 1368.56]  So, here's the way that the phone docks into the back of the Padphone station, which is
[1368.56 --> 1372.72]  the 9-inch, 16x10, 1920x1200 tablet.
[1374.00 --> 1382.74]  For $200 bucks on contract, would you accept a little bit of a reduction in terms of like
[1382.74 --> 1389.00]  fancy specs and features, like what you might get on an HTC One M8 for a more basic phone,
[1389.20 --> 1392.60]  but one that comes with a tablet, now that you've actually spent some time using a tablet?
[1395.10 --> 1396.04]  Probably not.
[1397.86 --> 1400.70]  I know that might sound surprising because I was feeling happy with the tablet.
[1400.70 --> 1401.10]  I am surprised.
[1401.70 --> 1404.24]  But that tablet was only $200 bucks in itself.
[1405.16 --> 1409.56]  But this is $200 bucks on contract, and the tablet-y part comes with your phone.
[1409.70 --> 1411.16]  And let's assume you already need a phone.
[1411.16 --> 1416.52]  Yeah, but then at the same time, independent batteries is kind of nice.
[1416.76 --> 1417.98]  They do have independent batteries.
[1418.80 --> 1420.50]  Can the tablet charge the phone?
[1424.34 --> 1426.10]  Like, I'm not sure exactly how it works.
[1426.18 --> 1428.36]  Or does it just run off the battery on the tablet?
[1430.40 --> 1431.10]  Hard to say.
[1431.46 --> 1431.96]  Hard to say.
[1432.08 --> 1434.48]  And it can run independently is kind of nice as well.
[1434.66 --> 1435.42]  Yeah, which it can't.
[1435.66 --> 1435.86]  Yeah.
[1436.20 --> 1437.72]  Because, like, I don't know.
[1437.90 --> 1439.38]  Wow, it's exactly 50-50.
[1439.50 --> 1440.00]  What the heck?
[1440.00 --> 1441.92]  I put it in the dock.
[1442.18 --> 1442.50]  Oh, sure.
[1442.52 --> 1442.76]  So you can find it.
[1442.84 --> 1443.80]  It's right under this topic.
[1444.32 --> 1446.46]  But being able to run it independently is nice.
[1446.98 --> 1453.72]  That way, like, if someone's over and you have your Chromecast set up to be able to stream things off your tablet, they can be looking at your tablet.
[1453.86 --> 1455.46]  And you can still have usability of your phone.
[1456.08 --> 1457.66]  Other things like that would be nice.
[1457.66 --> 1468.40]  If it's going to be, like, $50 more compared to buying an equivalent phone and you just get this tablet dock thing as well, I think that's pretty cool and I'd probably go for that.
[1468.46 --> 1469.56]  Which does kind of make sense.
[1469.70 --> 1470.96]  It sounds like what it actually is.
[1471.32 --> 1473.26]  So I'd probably be down.
[1473.96 --> 1474.32]  Wow.
[1474.32 --> 1477.44]  But I'm not super into buying phones on contract anymore anyways.
[1477.70 --> 1479.02]  That's exactly 50-50.
[1479.70 --> 1479.98]  That's crazy.
[1479.98 --> 1483.80]  Well, no, it's technically winning, but, like, yeah, not by much.
[1483.86 --> 1489.36]  If anyone hasn't voted yet, we can go ahead and pop that in there again.
[1489.42 --> 1491.04]  But that is absolutely amazing.
[1491.04 --> 1505.76]  So it looks like there's definitely some interest in the whole tablet phone merger thing, but it remains to be seen if anyone other than Asus has the wherewithal or the willingness or whatever you would call it.
[1505.76 --> 1506.18]  The gusto.
[1506.46 --> 1506.74]  Yeah.
[1506.98 --> 1507.84]  Wants to make one.
[1507.84 --> 1512.42]  I mean, it's the kind of thing you can see Samsung kind of going, oh, something we didn't think of.
[1512.48 --> 1513.28]  Let's make one too.
[1513.52 --> 1514.28]  And then.
[1514.74 --> 1515.94]  So everything that Samsung does?
[1516.10 --> 1517.10]  Yeah, pretty much.
[1517.54 --> 1519.08]  It's like an idea.
[1519.08 --> 1523.10]  Yeah, we're not sure if it's good or not, but let's make sure that we're covering all of our bases.
[1523.80 --> 1525.84]  And make really bad commercials to go along with them.
[1526.10 --> 1528.74]  Oh, you know, they were on a roll for a bit.
[1529.02 --> 1530.92]  That whole next best thing was great.
[1531.70 --> 1532.16]  And then.
[1532.72 --> 1536.26]  Their most recent one that they will not stop playing on YouTube is actually pretty OK.
[1536.40 --> 1536.70]  Is it?
[1536.78 --> 1536.96]  OK.
[1537.04 --> 1538.10]  I haven't seen that one yet.
[1539.16 --> 1539.52]  All right.
[1539.52 --> 1545.30]  It's for their watch and their phone at the same time in one commercial.
[1545.82 --> 1546.06]  OK.
[1546.22 --> 1547.40]  But it's like it's not that bad.
[1547.52 --> 1548.38]  It's fairly upbeat.
[1548.38 --> 1549.84]  It doesn't have a terrible storyline.
[1550.46 --> 1552.78]  Like the one with the guy picking up the chick with his smartwatch.
[1552.90 --> 1553.08]  Yeah.
[1553.22 --> 1553.36]  Yeah.
[1553.40 --> 1554.34]  None of that kind of stuff.
[1554.70 --> 1557.14]  It's just it's just kind of an upbeat commercial.
[1557.34 --> 1558.68]  And it's really hard to watch.
[1558.78 --> 1559.14]  It was.
[1559.28 --> 1560.52]  It was like painful.
[1561.02 --> 1561.38]  All right.
[1561.44 --> 1561.90]  So let's.
[1561.96 --> 1563.70]  It looks like no is actually winning now.
[1563.98 --> 1564.84]  But only by two percent.
[1564.86 --> 1565.68]  Let's hit the Twitters.
[1566.06 --> 1566.36]  All right.
[1566.66 --> 1567.00]  OK.
[1568.14 --> 1572.74]  All that Twitter interaction that we often forget to do sometimes these days.
[1572.90 --> 1573.40]  It's sort of crazy.
[1573.60 --> 1574.24]  Do you want me to turn it?
[1574.56 --> 1574.96]  Sorry.
[1575.22 --> 1575.82]  Do you want me to turn this?
[1576.06 --> 1576.32]  Sure.
[1576.72 --> 1576.88]  Yeah.
[1576.88 --> 1577.42]  That couldn't hurt.
[1577.58 --> 1577.92]  Whoa.
[1578.02 --> 1579.12]  That's kind of trippy.
[1579.60 --> 1582.56]  When someone turns the monitor while you're holding the mouse still.
[1583.18 --> 1583.64]  It's like.
[1583.88 --> 1584.24]  Oh.
[1584.34 --> 1585.70]  My mouse is moving man.
[1586.74 --> 1587.14]  Oh.
[1587.30 --> 1587.70]  Wow.
[1588.54 --> 1588.94]  Whoa.
[1588.94 --> 1589.44]  Whoa man.
[1591.34 --> 1591.78]  Whoa.
[1592.22 --> 1592.68]  All right.
[1592.76 --> 1596.28]  So the original phone pad distributes the battery power evenly.
[1596.52 --> 1597.66]  Not sure if the new one does though.
[1597.74 --> 1598.28]  That's interesting.
[1598.44 --> 1600.44]  So either one could charge off the other I guess.
[1600.50 --> 1600.62]  Right.
[1600.70 --> 1601.54]  That would be kind of cool actually.
[1601.54 --> 1601.90]  OK.
[1602.68 --> 1605.44]  Craigle says not a fan of the combination of the two.
[1605.54 --> 1607.62]  If one breaks then I have half a tablet.
[1608.00 --> 1609.76]  I don't see the benefit to having them connect.
[1610.08 --> 1610.28]  OK.
[1610.32 --> 1610.88]  That's interesting.
[1611.08 --> 1612.60]  But I mean by that logic.
[1612.94 --> 1613.56]  It's not really.
[1613.76 --> 1616.54]  Why buy a stereo that has both left and right speakers?
[1616.66 --> 1619.80]  Because then if one of the speakers fails you only have half a stereo.
[1620.06 --> 1621.22]  That's not even right.
[1621.34 --> 1622.04]  Because they disconnect.
[1622.48 --> 1622.70]  Yeah.
[1622.70 --> 1626.72]  If one of them breaks you either have a tablet and not a phone or you have a phone and not a tablet.
[1627.28 --> 1627.70]  You will never have a tablet.
[1627.70 --> 1629.40]  No because the tablet won't work without the phone.
[1629.80 --> 1632.56]  So you've either got a phone and no tablet or you have nothing.
[1632.58 --> 1634.14]  So if your phone breaks you're totally screwed.
[1634.22 --> 1634.42]  Yes.
[1635.24 --> 1635.52]  Yeah.
[1635.96 --> 1636.16]  Yeah.
[1636.20 --> 1636.52]  I don't know.
[1636.84 --> 1637.62]  That's not really.
[1638.38 --> 1640.60]  I have my PadPhone X pre-ordered.
[1640.78 --> 1644.04]  I get an almost top of the line phone and tablet on one data plan.
[1644.22 --> 1644.50]  That.
[1644.62 --> 1645.28]  That's a good point.
[1645.42 --> 1646.06]  That's a very good point.
[1646.06 --> 1646.60]  That's a very good point.
[1646.60 --> 1659.06]  The data plan point because for some reason the wireless carriers are still determined to fleece us on the whole idea that we should be able to use our data across multiple devices.
[1659.86 --> 1660.60]  It's like I just.
[1662.74 --> 1663.30]  Stuff.
[1663.30 --> 1663.84]  So annoying.
[1664.18 --> 1664.48]  Stuff.
[1664.64 --> 1667.98]  Battles that were won you know a hundred years ago.
[1668.46 --> 1669.38]  Like you know.
[1671.58 --> 1675.32]  Actually now that I think of it it's not that different from other things.
[1675.32 --> 1688.76]  I mean you look at you look at the way that your cable TV provider once you switched off of analog where you could just use splitters and they kind of like we're like oh yeah you need a digital box.
[1689.24 --> 1691.06]  Rent another digital box for every TV.
[1691.28 --> 1691.52]  Yeah.
[1691.76 --> 1692.38]  Cost extra.
[1693.68 --> 1694.16]  Yeah.
[1694.28 --> 1696.16]  I guess that's just the way everything's going.
[1696.32 --> 1699.02]  You have to subscribe per device rather than per person.
[1699.24 --> 1700.08]  Very annoying.
[1700.30 --> 1702.36]  Except except for Netflix.
[1702.36 --> 1705.72]  You just have to subscribe per device that's streaming at that point in time.
[1705.90 --> 1708.58]  It's whatever works out better for whoever's providing it to you.
[1708.68 --> 1709.98]  So you look at something like Windows.
[1710.20 --> 1713.22]  If I could license Windows per person I'd be thrilled.
[1713.74 --> 1714.82]  And that's per device.
[1715.24 --> 1717.90]  And then you look at actually what is per person.
[1718.94 --> 1719.58]  Oh boy.
[1720.12 --> 1723.68]  Well isn't Adobe Creative Cloud technically per person.
[1723.94 --> 1725.16]  Oh yeah that's per person for sure.
[1725.18 --> 1726.90]  But it's just not infinite amount of devices.
[1727.10 --> 1727.92]  It's like three or something.
[1727.96 --> 1728.12]  Two.
[1728.12 --> 1729.16]  Yeah two devices.
[1729.36 --> 1730.40]  So basically it's like.
[1730.78 --> 1731.62]  But you can bounce around.
[1731.72 --> 1734.60]  You just can't be logged in working on that many at one time.
[1735.00 --> 1735.20]  That's all.
[1735.40 --> 1735.80]  Okay.
[1736.00 --> 1741.56]  If they can make the phone not protrude so weirdly and the specs are still solid and the battery's good I'd get a combo dealio.
[1741.96 --> 1745.78]  You know I don't see how they would do that anytime soon though.
[1745.80 --> 1747.98]  Unless it was more like the phone kind of clips on.
[1747.98 --> 1751.10]  Because you're going to want the tablet to be really thin.
[1751.36 --> 1754.64]  And you're going to want the phone to have support while it's clipped in.
[1755.22 --> 1756.20]  Unless it was like.
[1756.34 --> 1756.94]  Unless there was.
[1757.42 --> 1757.82]  Yeah.
[1759.08 --> 1760.76]  I can't think of a good way to do that.
[1760.90 --> 1761.28]  Not really.
[1761.60 --> 1762.80]  We're also not engineers though.
[1764.20 --> 1766.38]  I would be interested in a phone tablet hybrid.
[1766.58 --> 1770.26]  But I feel if the tab is nine inches the phone is a bit too big at five inches.
[1770.76 --> 1773.62]  Five inches is not that big of a phone these days though.
[1773.82 --> 1775.94]  Which is funny to me because I still think.
[1775.94 --> 1776.18]  It's weird.
[1776.18 --> 1777.70]  I still find it big.
[1778.14 --> 1779.64]  Because my hands are still small.
[1779.74 --> 1784.90]  They didn't change because screen sizes became a fad that got bigger.
[1786.00 --> 1789.72]  And I find nine inches is a pretty comfortable size for a tablet.
[1789.84 --> 1791.48]  That's only a little bit smaller than the iPad.
[1793.70 --> 1794.14]  Really?
[1794.70 --> 1795.54]  I didn't say anything.
[1796.32 --> 1798.28]  Nine inches is a comfortable size for a tablet.
[1798.42 --> 1800.14]  I didn't even pause suggestively.
[1800.24 --> 1800.74]  I didn't say anything.
[1801.30 --> 1802.66]  You can click in whatever you want.
[1803.22 --> 1804.10]  Will says.
[1804.10 --> 1806.46]  I would need to see a quad core on everything.
[1806.78 --> 1809.02]  Greater than six pounds total weight.
[1809.54 --> 1811.28]  What are you asking for?
[1812.82 --> 1814.74]  Why would you want a six pound tablet?
[1815.38 --> 1816.10]  All right, Will.
[1816.14 --> 1816.50]  You're done.
[1816.56 --> 1819.66]  I think he's done his things wrong.
[1819.66 --> 1822.64]  Most phones have the specs to power a tablet anyway.
[1822.76 --> 1824.16]  Yeah, it's basically the same hardware.
[1824.30 --> 1825.70]  I mean, you look at the Apple side of things.
[1825.80 --> 1828.26]  They're just putting the same chips in their phones and their tablets.
[1828.48 --> 1831.58]  Makes sense for them to converge, but only if it's cheaper than two devices.
[1831.96 --> 1835.58]  And if you're saving money on the hardware and on the data plan,
[1836.44 --> 1838.70]  and basically you're just buying another screen in a shell,
[1838.88 --> 1840.74]  then there's definitely a savings to be had there.
[1840.82 --> 1841.26]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1841.26 --> 1846.74]  As a mobile game developer, I need top and hardware.
[1846.88 --> 1851.26]  Both of these are clearly lacking high-end CPUs and GPUs.
[1852.98 --> 1856.72]  Um, in what way?
[1857.20 --> 1859.92]  Because there's actually only one CPU and one GPU.
[1860.14 --> 1861.68]  The tablet doesn't have one.
[1862.30 --> 1863.68]  So this is running a...
[1864.52 --> 1865.64]  Hold on if I can find it.
[1865.70 --> 1865.82]  Yeah.
[1866.06 --> 1869.64]  Is it running both of these as in the tablet dock and the phone?
[1869.76 --> 1872.42]  Or is he talking about this and the Transformer 5?
[1872.70 --> 1873.44]  I'm not sure.
[1873.54 --> 1875.54]  It's very hard for me to say at this point in time.
[1876.30 --> 1878.34]  Um, but yeah, it's a Snapdragon 800.
[1878.58 --> 1879.38]  So it's not...
[1879.38 --> 1879.90]  It's...
[1879.90 --> 1883.88]  I mean, it doesn't get a whole load faster than that
[1883.88 --> 1885.58]  in terms of a mobile CPU.
[1885.80 --> 1888.84]  I mean, the 805 is marginally better at certain things.
[1888.84 --> 1892.38]  But it's not a quantum leap forward or anything like that.
[1892.46 --> 1894.78]  So I don't see that making much of a difference.
[1895.04 --> 1896.76]  All right, should we move on to our next topic here?
[1896.86 --> 1896.96]  Sure.
[1897.20 --> 1897.66]  All right.
[1898.60 --> 1899.62]  What do we got?
[1900.74 --> 1903.26]  The monitor that you're probably going to be excited about?
[1903.76 --> 1906.06]  Actually, believe it or not, I'm not.
[1906.18 --> 1906.92]  Or are we going to...
[1906.92 --> 1907.38]  Nope, nope.
[1907.42 --> 1908.54]  We're going to keep doing ASUS topics.
[1908.92 --> 1909.48]  Uh, why not?
[1909.88 --> 1911.96]  Oh, is there a monitor that I will be excited about?
[1912.08 --> 1913.26]  No, I was just saying, like,
[1913.32 --> 1916.32]  it seemed to be one big column of ASUS topics.
[1916.56 --> 1918.16]  Well, it was Computex.
[1918.16 --> 1920.46]  Computex is a big show for Taiwanese companies,
[1920.46 --> 1923.78]  so it makes a lot of sense that ASUS would have had a lot going on there.
[1924.10 --> 1924.66]  So why not?
[1924.98 --> 1928.02]  This is the PA-328Q.
[1928.16 --> 1931.46]  It's a 32-inch 4K, so that's 138 pixels per inch.
[1931.88 --> 1935.12]  Factory calibrated, just like ProArts tend to be.
[1935.38 --> 1936.20]  10-bit color.
[1936.74 --> 1938.32]  100% sRGB.
[1938.60 --> 1939.60]  Wide color gamut.
[1940.02 --> 1940.50]  Capable.
[1940.70 --> 1943.52]  It's got three HDMI inputs, one of which supports MHL,
[1943.84 --> 1945.42]  so you can output off your phone to your monitor,
[1945.42 --> 1946.80]  as if anyone's ever done that, ever.
[1946.80 --> 1949.44]  Um, I was corrected about that today, by the way.
[1949.52 --> 1952.86]  I was telling, um, the wheels over at NCIX
[1952.86 --> 1957.60]  that I think that tablets outputting to TVs doesn't matter
[1957.60 --> 1960.50]  because Chromecast is sort of a thing.
[1961.16 --> 1963.30]  And, yeah.
[1963.88 --> 1965.26]  And he's like, nope, I do it all the time.
[1966.10 --> 1966.40]  Why?
[1966.86 --> 1969.20]  I couldn't quite understand what he was talking about,
[1969.32 --> 1971.28]  but basically I concluded that he's drunk.
[1971.28 --> 1971.84]  Okay.
[1972.08 --> 1974.80]  Yeah, I was like, so how were you proved wrong here?
[1974.98 --> 1975.88]  I don't understand.
[1976.50 --> 1977.96]  So what's exciting about this one,
[1978.00 --> 1982.28]  even though Asus doesn't have a clear idea of when exactly it will be released
[1982.28 --> 1984.08]  or what exactly the price will be,
[1984.28 --> 1988.74]  it will be considerably cheaper than the $3,000 PQ series,
[1989.18 --> 1993.92]  which was launched, actually, I believe the first time we saw it was Computex last year.
[1993.98 --> 1994.28]  I think so.
[1994.28 --> 1997.26]  It's amazing the way prices are dropping on Dem4Ks, eh?
[1997.58 --> 1998.38]  It's exciting.
[1998.54 --> 1999.70]  Yeah, it's really exciting.
[1999.72 --> 2001.60]  It might actually be reasonable at some point in time.
[2002.08 --> 2005.24]  And in terms of the actual display quality,
[2005.44 --> 2007.52]  while it's not 100% clear what it'll be right now,
[2007.58 --> 2010.14]  they're not actually telling us what panel type it'll be,
[2010.64 --> 2013.44]  but 10-bit color, factory color calibrated.
[2013.92 --> 2015.20]  This could actually be anything.
[2015.28 --> 2015.72]  Hard to say.
[2015.78 --> 2017.72]  Anyway, this is the same size as that one,
[2018.04 --> 2019.42]  has a whack ton of inputs,
[2019.42 --> 2020.72]  is much, much cheaper,
[2020.96 --> 2025.24]  and should be landing sometime in the next sort of little while.
[2025.86 --> 2029.56]  But they're aiming for about half the price of the older PQ.
[2029.92 --> 2033.40]  So we should be looking at like $1,500 to $2,000-ish,
[2033.66 --> 2034.48]  somewhere in that range.
[2034.56 --> 2035.54]  So why not interested?
[2036.50 --> 2038.38]  Because I just don't care about 4K anymore.
[2039.34 --> 2040.66]  Oh, because you want your wide format.
[2040.90 --> 2041.72]  Yeah, I'm done.
[2042.24 --> 2046.32]  4K is until scaling is fixed.
[2047.44 --> 2047.88]  Yeah.
[2047.88 --> 2051.00]  Then I can't bring myself to use it.
[2051.18 --> 2053.64]  I'm not going to upgrade to a display
[2053.64 --> 2057.16]  that makes some things look extremely sharp
[2057.16 --> 2059.86]  and other things look worse than before.
[2060.04 --> 2062.04]  And some things incredibly hard to read.
[2062.22 --> 2062.36]  Yes.
[2062.36 --> 2064.94]  And weird website formatting and all this other stuff.
[2064.94 --> 2067.20]  And all that stuff that, you know,
[2067.38 --> 2070.10]  Microsoft and application developers
[2070.10 --> 2072.82]  really needed to be working on over the last few years
[2072.82 --> 2074.24]  as opposed to,
[2075.12 --> 2077.14]  Oh, 4K's here.
[2077.58 --> 2080.08]  Oh, I guess we better do something.
[2080.58 --> 2081.74]  Some of them are reacting.
[2081.94 --> 2082.66]  Some just aren't.
[2082.80 --> 2084.06]  Some just aren't reacting at all.
[2084.28 --> 2087.14]  And that kind of attitude is what sets Apple apart.
[2087.38 --> 2089.94]  And I know I come across as a bit of an Apple fanboy,
[2090.06 --> 2091.50]  but some of the things that they do
[2091.50 --> 2094.18]  are really, really good.
[2094.24 --> 2095.28]  And they're good things.
[2095.28 --> 2097.48]  The fact that they figured out
[2097.48 --> 2100.46]  how to make scaling work properly on their OSes
[2100.46 --> 2103.24]  before rolling out the hardware that supports it.
[2104.00 --> 2104.32]  Or at the same,
[2104.40 --> 2105.66]  like just putting in the work
[2105.66 --> 2107.74]  to make sure that things actually function
[2107.74 --> 2108.74]  the way that they intend
[2108.74 --> 2111.26]  is the kind of thing I feel like
[2111.26 --> 2112.72]  I should be able to take for granted,
[2112.98 --> 2115.40]  but I know that I can't.
[2115.62 --> 2116.36]  No, not at all.
[2116.52 --> 2117.40]  Not on our platforms.
[2117.66 --> 2119.04]  So speaking of Apple shilling.
[2119.52 --> 2119.82]  Yeah.
[2119.82 --> 2120.22]  Yeah.
[2120.40 --> 2121.14]  iOS 8.
[2121.24 --> 2124.54]  Actually, pretty excited to try iOS 8.
[2125.28 --> 2127.44]  Some of the stuff here doesn't look that interesting.
[2127.68 --> 2130.28]  I mean, HomeKit is going to be really exciting.
[2130.84 --> 2133.08]  Okay, McAfee, just screw it off.
[2133.24 --> 2133.58]  Go away.
[2133.70 --> 2137.92]  HomeKit is going to be either a massive success in the future
[2137.92 --> 2139.82]  or there's going to be something else
[2139.82 --> 2143.08]  that completely destroys it and is way better.
[2143.08 --> 2147.00]  But that's Apple's way of integrating their device
[2147.00 --> 2149.66]  with home automation stuff like your blinds
[2149.66 --> 2152.16]  or your thermostat or your door lock.
[2152.50 --> 2154.36]  They're building security into it
[2154.36 --> 2155.62]  so that the theory is that
[2155.62 --> 2158.08]  no one can unlock your door except you.
[2158.68 --> 2161.36]  What's interesting is with that whole thing
[2161.36 --> 2163.78]  with people remotely locking iPhones
[2163.78 --> 2165.98]  and then holding them for ransom.
[2167.36 --> 2170.04]  That was one thing.
[2171.70 --> 2174.64]  But breaking into people's phones
[2174.64 --> 2177.54]  and breaking into people,
[2177.60 --> 2180.78]  basically breaking into someone's ecosystem
[2180.78 --> 2182.14]  of digital devices
[2182.14 --> 2185.66]  is going to be a really scary thing.
[2185.76 --> 2186.58]  You know what would be interesting
[2186.58 --> 2188.30]  would be offline phones.
[2189.52 --> 2190.48]  Offline phones.
[2190.48 --> 2193.22]  Having a phone which is like your public phone
[2193.22 --> 2195.14]  which you don't store anything super crazy on.
[2195.32 --> 2196.12]  Are you a drug dealer?
[2196.38 --> 2197.78]  And then having a phone
[2197.78 --> 2199.16]  that you don't put a SIM card in.
[2199.22 --> 2200.24]  Do you often cheat on women?
[2200.86 --> 2201.30]  What?
[2201.30 --> 2204.08]  Why is two phones your solution to every problem?
[2204.78 --> 2206.38]  You've been watching too much Breaking Bad.
[2206.50 --> 2207.54]  I do that a lot too.
[2207.72 --> 2208.62]  I have two phones right now.
[2208.86 --> 2209.18]  Anyways.
[2212.52 --> 2213.96]  No to both those questions.
[2214.36 --> 2214.72]  But seriously,
[2214.84 --> 2215.92]  you could have one that's set up
[2215.92 --> 2217.16]  for all your home automation and everything.
[2217.46 --> 2217.74]  Yes.
[2218.04 --> 2219.34]  Does not connect to the internet.
[2219.64 --> 2219.96]  Okay.
[2220.14 --> 2221.80]  So you don't have to worry nearly as much
[2221.80 --> 2222.74]  about getting hijacked.
[2222.82 --> 2224.52]  You could still possibly get hijacked
[2224.52 --> 2225.66]  through other devices or whatever
[2225.66 --> 2227.02]  but it's going to be extremely difficult
[2227.02 --> 2228.76]  and it would probably have to be targeted
[2228.76 --> 2230.86]  directly at you instead of just a random...
[2230.86 --> 2232.88]  I think this is an incredibly stupid solution
[2232.88 --> 2233.52]  to the problem.
[2234.56 --> 2235.00]  Wow.
[2235.28 --> 2235.68]  Why?
[2235.78 --> 2236.76]  That's so mean.
[2237.38 --> 2237.82]  Because.
[2238.26 --> 2239.80]  It's the same reason nobody...
[2239.80 --> 2239.94]  Okay.
[2240.58 --> 2241.30]  Basically...
[2241.30 --> 2243.40]  Mobile phones have huge security holes
[2243.40 --> 2245.36]  so completely removing that security hole
[2245.36 --> 2245.78]  is helpful.
[2248.92 --> 2250.54]  Basically what you're suggesting
[2250.54 --> 2252.02]  is we bring back the PDA.
[2253.18 --> 2253.86]  Kind of.
[2254.26 --> 2255.56]  An offline phone.
[2255.96 --> 2256.44]  Yeah.
[2256.80 --> 2257.20]  No.
[2257.20 --> 2257.64]  Why?
[2258.16 --> 2259.04]  Because it's stupid.
[2259.10 --> 2260.20]  What if you're worried about your house
[2260.20 --> 2261.68]  getting hijacked?
[2261.80 --> 2262.30]  Straw poll.
[2262.38 --> 2262.92]  Okay, fine.
[2263.06 --> 2263.60]  Straw poll.
[2263.88 --> 2265.54]  Offline, offline phones.
[2265.76 --> 2266.96]  Do they need to be a thing
[2266.96 --> 2268.98]  or is Slick an idiot?
[2269.60 --> 2271.14]  Those can be the only two options.
[2271.76 --> 2272.84]  Yes, we need these.
[2273.54 --> 2274.34]  Luke is an idiot.
[2277.02 --> 2278.30]  I'm going to get destroyed.
[2281.74 --> 2283.60]  Sometimes you don't think before you talk.
[2283.74 --> 2285.34]  No, I actually still agree with this though
[2285.34 --> 2286.60]  but it doesn't have to be a phone.
[2286.60 --> 2288.60]  It could be just like a device
[2289.12 --> 2290.04]  that can control these.
[2290.04 --> 2292.20]  Okay, but I think the kind of device
[2292.20 --> 2293.12]  you're thinking of
[2293.12 --> 2295.14]  is just, is like,
[2295.38 --> 2296.68]  is like way overkill.
[2296.84 --> 2298.72]  What I see happening is more like a...
[2298.72 --> 2299.34]  That's what I mean.
[2299.46 --> 2300.56]  It doesn't have to be...
[2300.56 --> 2300.82]  Yeah.
[2301.08 --> 2301.60]  Like a ring controller.
[2301.60 --> 2302.36]  Whatever it is,
[2302.44 --> 2303.40]  it should be some device
[2303.40 --> 2305.04]  that has no internet connectivity
[2305.04 --> 2306.06]  and can go with you.
[2306.12 --> 2307.32]  I think I would still want a screen.
[2307.38 --> 2308.56]  I just want to see a straw poll
[2308.56 --> 2309.70]  where everyone calls you an idiot.
[2309.82 --> 2310.00]  I know.
[2310.00 --> 2310.80]  That was most of it.
[2310.90 --> 2311.86]  I still want a screen.
[2311.98 --> 2312.80]  That's why I said phone.
[2312.80 --> 2313.88]  Would you need a screen
[2313.88 --> 2315.06]  once you're more immersed
[2315.06 --> 2317.50]  in a wearable type of Google system?
[2317.62 --> 2318.52]  So your glass...
[2318.52 --> 2319.20]  As of right now,
[2319.26 --> 2320.18]  I do think so
[2320.18 --> 2321.30]  because...
[2321.30 --> 2322.72]  Well, glass is going to be connected to the internet.
[2322.88 --> 2324.22]  If you connect your glass to that device
[2324.22 --> 2325.54]  then you're just creating a hole.
[2325.64 --> 2326.34]  What if you don't?
[2326.68 --> 2328.58]  What if you just go like...
[2328.58 --> 2330.44]  What if you just touch your ring against your glass?
[2330.92 --> 2332.62]  It goes into airplane mode.
[2332.62 --> 2332.64]  And you're connected.
[2332.86 --> 2333.20]  Hold on.
[2333.36 --> 2334.74]  What if it just acts as a display?
[2335.74 --> 2337.02]  So the processing's here.
[2337.82 --> 2338.76]  Everything is here
[2338.76 --> 2340.24]  except just a display link.
[2340.48 --> 2341.26]  There's no way...
[2341.26 --> 2342.04]  To my knowledge,
[2342.16 --> 2344.32]  there's no way to hack a DVI connection.
[2344.92 --> 2346.72]  Like, that's a pretty minor issue.
[2346.80 --> 2347.40]  I don't really know.
[2348.14 --> 2349.82]  So if you use that as a control,
[2349.92 --> 2351.32]  so you basically just had your glass
[2351.32 --> 2352.76]  and then you could gesture
[2352.76 --> 2353.84]  or do whatever else
[2353.84 --> 2354.64]  or type in the air
[2354.64 --> 2355.66]  or whatever solutions
[2355.66 --> 2356.56]  they end up coming up with,
[2356.82 --> 2357.96]  I think that's feasible.
[2358.90 --> 2359.84]  So a wearable
[2359.84 --> 2360.98]  is probably the right answer here.
[2361.00 --> 2361.96]  But I would still want to...
[2361.96 --> 2362.38]  I don't know.
[2363.26 --> 2363.66]  I don't know.
[2363.66 --> 2365.70]  I don't think connecting it to...
[2365.70 --> 2366.82]  Because it's not DVI.
[2366.92 --> 2367.56]  I'll tell you what.
[2368.14 --> 2368.64]  I'll tell you what.
[2368.74 --> 2372.08]  I will bring my old HP Pocket PC in.
[2372.22 --> 2373.28]  But that's not the same.
[2373.36 --> 2373.92]  It's not helpful.
[2374.06 --> 2374.64]  It has.
[2375.32 --> 2376.72]  Because I would want it to be...
[2376.72 --> 2379.60]  It has a 733 megahertz...
[2379.60 --> 2380.96]  Oh no, 533 megahertz.
[2380.96 --> 2381.38]  I was like,
[2381.44 --> 2382.28]  that's actually pretty fast.
[2382.30 --> 2383.50]  X-scale processor.
[2383.76 --> 2384.08]  All right?
[2384.48 --> 2385.76]  It's got like...
[2385.76 --> 2387.02]  This is not the point though.
[2387.02 --> 2388.52]  It's got like 128 megs of RAM.
[2388.66 --> 2390.08]  I can have it connected to my parents' house.
[2390.16 --> 2391.52]  I can have it connected to my house.
[2391.52 --> 2392.82]  I can have it connected to, say,
[2392.84 --> 2394.02]  my significant other's house.
[2394.20 --> 2395.54]  And then whenever I go there,
[2395.60 --> 2396.62]  it can recognize me
[2396.62 --> 2397.92]  and I can change different things
[2397.92 --> 2398.92]  on the device.
[2398.92 --> 2400.54]  But then it's not connected to the internet
[2400.54 --> 2401.48]  so I don't have to worry about
[2401.48 --> 2402.38]  those things leaking.
[2402.60 --> 2405.68]  I have 64 megs of compact flash storage in it.
[2405.68 --> 2406.86]  I don't care about your stupid pocket PC.
[2407.32 --> 2408.96]  That's not what I'm trying to describe.
[2409.18 --> 2410.36]  Yeah, that's not the thing in my pocket
[2410.36 --> 2411.18]  you care about, I guess.
[2411.30 --> 2411.82]  No, it's not.
[2412.14 --> 2412.46]  All right.
[2412.50 --> 2413.52]  Let's go ahead and...
[2414.14 --> 2415.98]  Not as many people grilled me as I thought.
[2416.30 --> 2416.62]  Okay.
[2416.74 --> 2418.10]  Where's our straw poll?
[2418.58 --> 2419.08]  It's...
[2420.08 --> 2422.66]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, bollocks.
[2423.18 --> 2423.68]  There we go.
[2423.98 --> 2424.46]  All right.
[2424.66 --> 2425.96]  No, no, no.
[2426.64 --> 2427.32]  Where's ours?
[2427.34 --> 2428.28]  I just posted it.
[2428.32 --> 2429.24]  You just keep looking away
[2429.24 --> 2430.04]  whenever I post it.
[2430.18 --> 2430.66]  There you go.
[2431.30 --> 2432.10]  There we go.
[2432.22 --> 2432.68]  All right.
[2432.76 --> 2433.94]  So let's have a look at the results
[2433.94 --> 2434.62]  of the poll here.
[2434.82 --> 2435.22]  Wow.
[2435.44 --> 2437.14]  Actually, you're doing better than I thought.
[2438.70 --> 2442.30]  42% of people are blindly following you
[2442.30 --> 2443.28]  off of the abyss
[2443.28 --> 2444.26]  like the lemmings that they are.
[2444.26 --> 2446.30]  Because you just want everyone's house to get locked.
[2446.56 --> 2450.26]  And 658% of you are saying
[2450.26 --> 2452.22]  that that's basically a stupid idea
[2452.22 --> 2452.94]  from a stupid person.
[2452.94 --> 2454.20]  658%?
[2454.92 --> 2456.70]  Well, I might have embellished it a little bit.
[2456.70 --> 2457.88]  So they're all following the dude
[2457.88 --> 2460.06]  that can't read anything at all
[2460.06 --> 2461.30]  and just adds numbers to you.
[2461.30 --> 2461.84]  You know what?
[2461.98 --> 2462.82]  Not being able to read
[2462.82 --> 2464.28]  is a specific learning disability
[2464.28 --> 2466.28]  that actually you have and I don't.
[2467.00 --> 2467.36]  That's...
[2467.36 --> 2468.26]  No, I can still read.
[2468.42 --> 2468.68]  Right.
[2468.84 --> 2469.36]  But slowly.
[2469.70 --> 2470.04]  Yes.
[2470.20 --> 2470.50]  Yes.
[2470.76 --> 2471.46]  But that's not...
[2471.46 --> 2471.84]  What?
[2472.28 --> 2473.12]  Yeah, that's right.
[2473.12 --> 2474.80]  That's not right at all.
[2475.00 --> 2476.52]  It's getting personal now, bitch.
[2476.54 --> 2477.58]  And you're just wrong.
[2479.16 --> 2481.26]  At least I don't wet my pants during the show.
[2481.72 --> 2482.26]  I don't...
[2482.26 --> 2482.54]  What?
[2483.34 --> 2484.62]  You said you were so sweaty
[2484.62 --> 2485.42]  that your pants were wet.
[2485.66 --> 2486.38]  Actually, that was me.
[2486.50 --> 2486.92]  But...
[2486.92 --> 2489.26]  That was so not true at all.
[2489.66 --> 2491.06]  You literally said that
[2491.06 --> 2491.90]  like last week.
[2492.70 --> 2493.10]  What?
[2495.58 --> 2496.66]  Now you're making...
[2496.66 --> 2497.10]  Oh, man.
[2497.14 --> 2498.50]  You're just saying things about yourself
[2498.50 --> 2499.50]  and then...
[2499.50 --> 2502.24]  That doesn't even make any sense.
[2502.24 --> 2502.74]  I'm projecting.
[2504.82 --> 2505.66]  Oh, my goodness.
[2505.80 --> 2506.62]  I'm a troubled person.
[2506.62 --> 2507.50]  All right.
[2507.56 --> 2508.86]  So back to iOS 8.
[2508.98 --> 2510.96]  It's available for developers in beta now
[2510.96 --> 2512.46]  and it'll get a full release in the fall.
[2512.68 --> 2515.94]  We are finally getting third-party keyboards,
[2516.34 --> 2519.94]  which is something that I was really disappointed about
[2519.94 --> 2522.68]  with moving from Android back to iOS.
[2522.88 --> 2524.94]  Going back to being stuck with just one keyboard
[2524.94 --> 2527.82]  was grinding my gears.
[2527.82 --> 2531.98]  And this is one big step towards me being able to use iOS again.
[2533.18 --> 2533.70]  They do...
[2533.70 --> 2538.44]  Their own keyboard is also getting some enhanced functionality
[2538.44 --> 2540.20]  in terms of an auto-prediction
[2540.20 --> 2541.38]  that predicts the next word
[2541.38 --> 2543.70]  based on people that you're talking to
[2543.70 --> 2545.06]  and whatever else.
[2545.46 --> 2546.68]  So basically like SwiftKey,
[2546.80 --> 2548.50]  except with even tighter integration.
[2548.50 --> 2551.84]  I wonder if the custom keyboard apps
[2551.84 --> 2553.32]  would be able to access that as well.
[2553.58 --> 2554.10]  I would hope so.
[2554.32 --> 2554.82]  I would hope so.
[2554.86 --> 2555.54]  Because that would be nice
[2555.54 --> 2557.66]  because doesn't iPhone have that thing
[2557.66 --> 2559.54]  where it doesn't let you swear and stuff?
[2560.42 --> 2560.64]  No.
[2560.90 --> 2561.76]  Or can you add it?
[2561.88 --> 2562.12]  Oh, yeah.
[2562.12 --> 2562.50]  Can you add the dictionary?
[2562.68 --> 2562.94]  Oh, yeah.
[2563.14 --> 2563.26]  For sure.
[2563.26 --> 2565.02]  I've never extensively used an iPhone,
[2565.14 --> 2565.52]  so I don't know.
[2565.88 --> 2567.50]  So you can reply directly
[2567.50 --> 2569.20]  from the notification pull-down thing.
[2569.28 --> 2570.60]  So you've got interactive notifications.
[2571.26 --> 2572.14]  Their mail app,
[2572.16 --> 2572.92]  which I never use
[2572.92 --> 2575.62]  because the Gmail one is way better,
[2575.62 --> 2578.86]  has gestures for removing, flagging, and such.
[2579.20 --> 2580.28]  Their health kit thing
[2580.28 --> 2583.38]  is basically Apple jumping on the whole bandwagon
[2583.38 --> 2586.66]  of heart monitors and whatever.
[2586.94 --> 2588.38]  What's kind of cool about health kit
[2588.38 --> 2591.40]  is you can actually have your results
[2591.40 --> 2592.60]  being automatically sent over
[2592.60 --> 2594.38]  to Mayo Clinic or your doctor
[2594.38 --> 2595.28]  or something like that.
[2595.44 --> 2597.48]  So someone else can be helping you
[2597.48 --> 2598.84]  track your activity.
[2600.30 --> 2601.20]  HomeKit, I guess,
[2601.28 --> 2602.48]  is where we got sidetracked.
[2603.36 --> 2605.44]  Photos taken with any iOS 8 device
[2605.44 --> 2606.96]  will be available via iCloud.
[2607.36 --> 2609.04]  So it's like, okay.
[2609.24 --> 2609.56]  Hooray.
[2609.88 --> 2611.38]  Kind of like BitTorrent Sync or Dropbox.
[2611.40 --> 2612.78]  Or Dropbox or whatever.
[2613.92 --> 2616.08]  200 gigs of iCloud is $399.
[2616.76 --> 2618.64]  Siri now has Shazam integration,
[2619.02 --> 2619.82]  which is pretty cool
[2619.82 --> 2622.08]  because opening up Shazam was a lot of work.
[2622.64 --> 2623.82]  And then finally,
[2623.98 --> 2625.90]  it's coming to the iPhone 4S or newer.
[2626.16 --> 2627.08]  And get this.
[2627.66 --> 2630.46]  The iPad 2 is getting iOS 8.
[2630.72 --> 2631.68]  That's actually kind of interesting.
[2631.72 --> 2632.62]  That is fantastic.
[2632.62 --> 2634.08]  They do some pretty crazy stuff
[2634.08 --> 2635.28]  in terms of backwards compatibility.
[2635.68 --> 2636.60]  I mean, that's great.
[2636.90 --> 2639.06]  I have tablets from that era
[2639.06 --> 2641.04]  that are running like 4.0.
[2641.28 --> 2641.58]  Yeah.
[2642.62 --> 2643.54]  That's great.
[2643.68 --> 2644.54]  It's kind of brutal.
[2645.46 --> 2646.30]  I actually,
[2646.46 --> 2648.14]  I'm more interested in the Shazam integration
[2648.14 --> 2648.84]  than I think you are
[2648.84 --> 2650.08]  because it would be nice,
[2650.44 --> 2651.68]  like, especially if you're driving.
[2652.02 --> 2652.94]  You don't want to touch your phone.
[2653.00 --> 2654.24]  You don't want to go open Shazam.
[2655.34 --> 2656.16]  And you don't want to be like,
[2656.22 --> 2658.88]  Siri, open Shazam or whatever.
[2659.46 --> 2660.66]  Okay, you're probably right.
[2660.86 --> 2662.42]  Because you said they're adding
[2662.42 --> 2664.12]  Hello Siri kind of support, aren't they?
[2664.14 --> 2664.54]  Hey Siri.
[2664.66 --> 2665.32]  Hey Siri, yeah.
[2665.60 --> 2668.84]  So if you can do completely hands-less,
[2668.96 --> 2670.08]  like touch-less completely
[2670.08 --> 2671.20]  without any worrying,
[2671.32 --> 2672.00]  that would be kind of nice
[2672.00 --> 2673.02]  to be able to check songs and stuff.
[2673.20 --> 2674.52]  Yeah, you're probably right.
[2674.60 --> 2675.42]  It's probably a bigger deal
[2675.42 --> 2676.38]  than I'm giving it credit for
[2676.38 --> 2677.56]  because it is something
[2677.56 --> 2678.62]  that I use a fair bit
[2678.62 --> 2679.98]  because I don't really pay attention
[2679.98 --> 2681.82]  to celebrities and releases.
[2681.82 --> 2682.34]  No, me neither.
[2682.54 --> 2682.94]  Releases.
[2683.18 --> 2684.00]  I'll just be like,
[2684.06 --> 2684.82]  I'll be in the mall
[2684.82 --> 2687.32]  and some horrible song
[2687.32 --> 2688.52]  will be on the radio
[2688.52 --> 2689.06]  and I'll be like,
[2689.16 --> 2690.38]  wow, that sounds great.
[2692.12 --> 2693.04]  What is it?
[2694.50 --> 2695.28]  Yeah, I hear you.
[2696.38 --> 2696.90]  That's funny.
[2697.22 --> 2698.52]  I gotta get me some of that.
[2698.62 --> 2699.88]  Some of that top 40.
[2700.28 --> 2700.64]  Mmm.
[2701.62 --> 2702.04]  All right.
[2702.10 --> 2702.78]  Should we save,
[2702.92 --> 2704.54]  let's save the Microsoft promises
[2704.54 --> 2706.32]  to do more for PC gaming for later.
[2706.32 --> 2706.86]  For like the fifth time.
[2706.86 --> 2708.62]  So first up is Cortana.
[2708.82 --> 2710.14]  Oh my God, I'm so excited.
[2710.28 --> 2712.10]  I'm actually stoked for this.
[2712.10 --> 2713.40]  Do you want to cover this one?
[2714.22 --> 2714.66]  Sure.
[2715.38 --> 2717.00]  I've been super, super interested
[2717.00 --> 2718.54]  in voice controlling devices
[2718.54 --> 2719.86]  for quite a while now
[2719.86 --> 2721.76]  and I've been waiting
[2721.76 --> 2723.20]  for Cortana announcements
[2723.20 --> 2725.00]  and being able to listen to it
[2725.00 --> 2725.70]  more in depth
[2725.70 --> 2726.84]  and see them talk about it
[2726.84 --> 2727.32]  and all that kind of stuff.
[2727.40 --> 2728.68]  So I was super excited to see this.
[2729.00 --> 2730.62]  If you go to this website,
[2730.94 --> 2732.40]  either, I think both of them have it,
[2732.48 --> 2734.30]  but Engadget or VG247,
[2734.82 --> 2737.26]  you can listen to audio clips
[2737.26 --> 2738.22]  of her talking.
[2739.12 --> 2740.62]  It's essentially the answer
[2740.62 --> 2741.92]  to Google Now and Siri
[2741.92 --> 2743.34]  for Windows Phone
[2743.34 --> 2744.18]  and I think they're adding it
[2744.18 --> 2745.10]  to Xbox as well.
[2745.52 --> 2747.04]  But she should be able
[2747.04 --> 2748.30]  to have casual conversations
[2748.30 --> 2749.08]  with you as well,
[2749.24 --> 2750.22]  which is fairly interesting.
[2750.62 --> 2751.20]  And creepy.
[2752.24 --> 2752.88]  It's creepy,
[2753.12 --> 2754.28]  but not necessarily
[2754.28 --> 2755.34]  because if she could...
[2755.34 --> 2756.74]  I'm old and afraid of technology,
[2756.90 --> 2757.66]  so it's kind of creepy,
[2757.80 --> 2758.24]  but go ahead.
[2758.56 --> 2758.80]  Okay.
[2758.94 --> 2759.94]  I don't think it's that creepy,
[2760.10 --> 2760.94]  but I guess I'm not
[2760.94 --> 2762.46]  as old as Linus is.
[2762.46 --> 2763.32]  I just don't expect it
[2763.32 --> 2764.12]  to work very well.
[2765.12 --> 2765.70]  Because they're...
[2765.70 --> 2766.94]  In the articles,
[2767.12 --> 2767.94]  they have examples
[2767.94 --> 2770.18]  of kind of cheeky things
[2770.18 --> 2770.96]  that she'll say.
[2771.08 --> 2771.76]  Like if you ask her
[2771.76 --> 2772.74]  if she's better than Siri,
[2772.92 --> 2773.44]  she says,
[2773.92 --> 2774.46]  not to brag,
[2774.54 --> 2775.32]  but apparently I'll help
[2775.32 --> 2775.92]  save the universe
[2775.92 --> 2777.14]  in about 500 years.
[2777.82 --> 2778.36]  And I'm just kind of like,
[2778.42 --> 2780.12]  yeah, but all those are like...
[2780.12 --> 2781.40]  Anything that relies
[2781.40 --> 2783.26]  on a pre-programmed response
[2783.26 --> 2785.54]  is always going to
[2785.54 --> 2786.44]  not be that great.
[2786.54 --> 2788.66]  It's like bullet holes
[2788.66 --> 2789.64]  in the side of a house
[2789.64 --> 2790.10]  in a game.
[2790.92 --> 2792.24]  Until we get to the point
[2792.24 --> 2794.38]  where the wood dynamically breaks
[2794.38 --> 2796.16]  upon impact from the bullet,
[2796.66 --> 2797.36]  it's going to look
[2797.36 --> 2798.10]  like a video game.
[2798.54 --> 2798.70]  Yeah.
[2799.50 --> 2800.26]  Yeah, that's true.
[2800.32 --> 2800.94]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2801.14 --> 2801.24]  Go ahead.
[2801.36 --> 2803.98]  But because it's all in server,
[2804.12 --> 2805.26]  they're planning on adding
[2805.26 --> 2806.84]  things like jokes
[2806.84 --> 2807.44]  and all this kind of stuff
[2807.44 --> 2808.36]  as time goes on.
[2808.40 --> 2808.88]  Every two weeks,
[2808.88 --> 2809.72]  I think they were saying.
[2809.78 --> 2810.54]  Yeah, so things like
[2810.54 --> 2811.68]  it can go along
[2811.68 --> 2812.50]  with current events.
[2812.72 --> 2813.38]  So if you ask it
[2813.38 --> 2814.52]  about current events,
[2814.54 --> 2816.08]  it can have topical things
[2816.08 --> 2816.76]  to say about
[2816.76 --> 2817.30]  all that kind of stuff.
[2817.40 --> 2818.82]  So while you're completely right
[2818.82 --> 2820.50]  and it's going to add
[2820.50 --> 2821.58]  this weird thing
[2821.58 --> 2822.98]  where you could ask her
[2822.98 --> 2823.56]  the same question
[2823.56 --> 2824.18]  a billion times
[2824.18 --> 2824.82]  and she's probably going to
[2824.82 --> 2825.42]  say the same thing
[2825.42 --> 2825.88]  every time.
[2826.04 --> 2826.18]  Yeah.
[2826.24 --> 2826.86]  And that's going to sound
[2826.86 --> 2827.50]  a little weird,
[2827.62 --> 2828.36]  like the same thing
[2828.36 --> 2829.26]  down to the letter.
[2829.54 --> 2829.74]  Yeah.
[2829.88 --> 2830.58]  So that might be
[2830.58 --> 2831.14]  a little bit weird
[2831.14 --> 2832.14]  and a little bit disconnecting.
[2832.38 --> 2833.58]  They're going to be adding
[2833.58 --> 2834.52]  to it all the time,
[2834.56 --> 2835.48]  which should help that a lot.
[2835.84 --> 2837.62]  And you're kind of right
[2837.62 --> 2838.12]  at the same time,
[2838.18 --> 2838.58]  there's going to be
[2838.58 --> 2839.18]  this disconnect.
[2839.52 --> 2840.26]  The conversations aren't
[2840.26 --> 2841.10]  going to feel supernatural.
[2841.30 --> 2841.60]  All that kind of stuff.
[2841.74 --> 2843.18]  I'm sure that's going to happen.
[2843.56 --> 2844.56]  But this is the start.
[2844.90 --> 2845.80]  I also just don't really
[2845.80 --> 2846.50]  have any desire
[2846.50 --> 2847.56]  to converse with my phone.
[2848.82 --> 2849.38]  Not really.
[2850.96 --> 2851.98]  If it could like,
[2852.56 --> 2852.98]  I don't know,
[2853.04 --> 2854.48]  because I really, really like
[2854.48 --> 2856.64]  OK Google Now, What's Up?
[2857.24 --> 2857.50]  Yeah.
[2857.52 --> 2858.60]  But it's horrible.
[2859.32 --> 2861.14]  It is so terrible
[2861.14 --> 2862.82]  and it is not useful.
[2863.74 --> 2865.10]  OK, you might have to
[2865.10 --> 2866.94]  sort of elaborate on that.
[2866.94 --> 2868.16]  I don't have my phone on that.
[2868.16 --> 2869.02]  I wish I could do,
[2869.08 --> 2870.04]  I would do a live demo,
[2870.18 --> 2870.62]  but I don't.
[2872.24 --> 2872.94]  I'll go like,
[2873.00 --> 2873.62]  I'll have some emails
[2873.62 --> 2874.44]  and some text messages
[2874.44 --> 2874.90]  and whatever.
[2875.44 --> 2875.94]  And I'm like,
[2876.00 --> 2876.96]  OK Google Now, What's Up?
[2876.98 --> 2877.36]  And it's like,
[2877.60 --> 2878.30]  Hello Luke!
[2878.30 --> 2880.52]  The time is 6.47pm.
[2881.06 --> 2882.12]  You have two emails,
[2882.26 --> 2882.84]  subject line,
[2882.94 --> 2884.42]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2884.50 --> 2884.94]  OK, done.
[2884.98 --> 2886.20]  You have text messages from done.
[2886.28 --> 2886.56]  OK, bye.
[2887.52 --> 2888.24]  It's like, what?
[2888.34 --> 2889.04]  That was, what?
[2889.04 --> 2890.10]  Where's the interactivity?
[2890.24 --> 2891.00]  How do I say,
[2891.46 --> 2892.76]  oh, hey, reply to that message?
[2892.76 --> 2893.94]  You can't respond to anything.
[2894.24 --> 2895.70]  I don't need to know the time
[2895.70 --> 2896.74]  every single time.
[2896.74 --> 2899.42]  The longest part of her talking to me
[2899.42 --> 2900.30]  is her making sure
[2900.30 --> 2901.28]  that she takes time
[2901.28 --> 2902.20]  in between words
[2902.20 --> 2902.64]  saying,
[2902.80 --> 2903.44]  hello Luke,
[2903.70 --> 2905.56]  the time is blah, blah, blah.
[2905.80 --> 2907.20]  Then once she gets to her email,
[2907.34 --> 2907.88]  she blurts,
[2908.12 --> 2909.02]  email and text messages,
[2909.14 --> 2910.84]  she blurts out things super fast,
[2911.16 --> 2912.64]  doesn't always read them correctly,
[2913.34 --> 2915.04]  like rifles through it,
[2915.08 --> 2916.10]  doesn't say who it's from.
[2916.22 --> 2916.90]  Like, I'll get text,
[2917.00 --> 2917.44]  it'll be like,
[2917.48 --> 2918.42]  you have a text message,
[2918.96 --> 2920.74]  body of the message,
[2921.22 --> 2922.72]  doesn't say who it's from,
[2923.10 --> 2924.20]  can't reply to it.
[2924.70 --> 2925.24]  I'm just like,
[2925.38 --> 2927.36]  what was I supposed to gain from now?
[2927.36 --> 2927.56]  Yeah, it's like,
[2927.64 --> 2928.16]  subject line,
[2928.28 --> 2929.62]  I want you so bad right now.
[2929.76 --> 2930.12]  And it's like,
[2930.34 --> 2931.12]  who is this from?
[2931.18 --> 2932.60]  There could be a dozen different people.
[2934.58 --> 2935.32]  Such a player.
[2935.66 --> 2936.88]  No, what?
[2938.50 --> 2939.28]  Oh my God.
[2939.36 --> 2939.94]  Okay, anyways,
[2940.06 --> 2940.38]  but like,
[2940.52 --> 2941.92]  there are a lot of messages
[2941.92 --> 2942.94]  that aren't like that,
[2943.00 --> 2943.94]  that could be from anyone.
[2944.48 --> 2945.02]  So I don't,
[2945.12 --> 2945.78]  it's annoying.
[2945.96 --> 2946.28]  And like,
[2946.32 --> 2947.68]  if someone sends me a text message,
[2948.02 --> 2948.48]  that's like,
[2948.80 --> 2949.64]  hey, are you on the way?
[2950.24 --> 2950.90]  This is the time
[2950.90 --> 2952.06]  where it would be amazingly helpful.
[2952.18 --> 2952.80]  My phone goes off,
[2952.86 --> 2953.72]  it says I have a text message.
[2954.50 --> 2955.24]  Okay, Google now,
[2955.30 --> 2955.72]  what's up?
[2956.36 --> 2957.18]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[2957.18 --> 2957.76]  says,
[2958.12 --> 2958.96]  hey, are you on the way?
[2959.66 --> 2960.66]  Oh, respond.
[2960.94 --> 2961.76]  Yeah, I'm just driving.
[2963.58 --> 2964.64]  That would be amazing.
[2964.76 --> 2965.54]  Well, one of the problems
[2965.54 --> 2966.50]  that I have with,
[2966.72 --> 2967.92]  that I've had with
[2967.92 --> 2970.02]  Google's voice activation in general,
[2970.02 --> 2971.52]  and they fixed one of them recently
[2971.52 --> 2972.26]  to their credit.
[2972.40 --> 2972.84]  Like, I gotta,
[2973.02 --> 2974.30]  I gotta give them props for this.
[2974.70 --> 2976.18]  Was the way their voice dialing
[2976.18 --> 2976.76]  used to work
[2976.76 --> 2977.68]  is you'd say,
[2977.90 --> 2978.70]  call whoever
[2978.70 --> 2980.66]  work or mobile.
[2980.66 --> 2981.84]  And it would say,
[2982.56 --> 2983.48]  do you want to call
[2983.48 --> 2984.00]  blah, blah, blah?
[2984.42 --> 2984.78]  Yes.
[2985.26 --> 2985.78]  Or I think,
[2985.84 --> 2986.14]  no, no,
[2986.14 --> 2986.84]  I think it was
[2986.84 --> 2988.50]  calling whoever,
[2989.12 --> 2990.20]  would you like to call
[2990.20 --> 2990.72]  blah, blah, blah,
[2990.80 --> 2991.10]  work?
[2991.22 --> 2991.82]  Would you like to call
[2991.82 --> 2992.24]  blah, blah, blah,
[2992.32 --> 2992.58]  mobile?
[2992.58 --> 2994.64]  Call this one.
[2994.70 --> 2995.70]  Like, it didn't just let you
[2995.70 --> 2996.48]  do it in one go.
[2996.52 --> 2997.02]  Yeah, yeah.
[2997.08 --> 2997.94]  And then it'd say,
[2998.14 --> 2999.34]  and then I think it would ask you
[2999.34 --> 3000.72]  to confirm or something like that.
[3000.76 --> 3000.98]  I'm like,
[3001.16 --> 3001.64]  no!
[3002.66 --> 3003.80]  Just when I say it,
[3003.84 --> 3004.70]  just do it.
[3004.90 --> 3005.46]  And I think,
[3005.56 --> 3006.30]  I think part of,
[3006.30 --> 3007.10]  And they fixed that now.
[3007.40 --> 3007.54]  Right.
[3007.96 --> 3009.02]  And I think with,
[3009.40 --> 3010.96]  like, Moto X,
[3011.48 --> 3012.44]  I think you can have it
[3012.44 --> 3013.54]  detect if you're driving,
[3013.54 --> 3014.54]  and if you're driving,
[3014.80 --> 3015.44]  I think it will
[3015.44 --> 3017.16]  do a little bit better
[3017.16 --> 3018.66]  than OK Google Now does.
[3019.04 --> 3019.28]  Right.
[3019.28 --> 3020.08]  But then,
[3020.62 --> 3021.28]  and then like,
[3021.38 --> 3022.10]  OK Google Now
[3022.10 --> 3022.96]  isn't even on
[3022.96 --> 3024.38]  a massive amount of devices.
[3025.94 --> 3026.34]  So,
[3026.88 --> 3027.24]  what?
[3027.32 --> 3028.18]  Yeah, it's just on Moto X
[3028.18 --> 3028.56]  right now.
[3028.68 --> 3028.92]  Yeah.
[3029.00 --> 3029.36]  To my knowledge.
[3029.38 --> 3029.78]  So like,
[3029.82 --> 3030.40]  what?
[3030.80 --> 3031.02]  Ugh.
[3031.48 --> 3032.34]  And it's just OK Google.
[3032.44 --> 3032.96]  You don't have to say
[3032.96 --> 3033.58]  Google Now anymore,
[3033.62 --> 3033.94]  I don't think.
[3034.36 --> 3035.20]  I've tried that.
[3035.62 --> 3036.46]  Oh, it's not working for you?
[3036.54 --> 3037.44]  Maybe it just doesn't like
[3037.44 --> 3038.52]  my voice for when I say that.
[3038.56 --> 3038.84]  Could be,
[3038.84 --> 3039.94]  because you and I have had
[3039.94 --> 3041.52]  apparently lots of problems
[3041.52 --> 3042.08]  with Google Now
[3042.08 --> 3042.90]  that no one else
[3042.90 --> 3044.10]  in the entire universe
[3044.10 --> 3044.60]  has had.
[3044.86 --> 3045.64]  So, anyway,
[3045.78 --> 3046.44]  I'm going to give,
[3046.54 --> 3047.56]  I'll give Windows Phone 8
[3047.56 --> 3048.28]  another crack
[3048.28 --> 3049.74]  once Cortana rolls out.
[3049.80 --> 3050.96]  It's been over a year
[3050.96 --> 3051.90]  since I've tried it.
[3052.12 --> 3052.90]  That was back when
[3052.90 --> 3053.54]  Windows Phone 8
[3053.54 --> 3054.88]  was first kind of rolling out.
[3055.34 --> 3057.04]  And I'm pretty excited about it.
[3057.14 --> 3057.86]  I'd like to see
[3057.86 --> 3058.80]  what it's like.
[3059.00 --> 3060.26]  And I don't know
[3060.26 --> 3061.18]  that it's going to convince me
[3061.18 --> 3061.70]  to switch back
[3061.70 --> 3062.40]  to Windows Phone.
[3062.76 --> 3063.14]  In fact,
[3063.20 --> 3064.46]  I sincerely doubt it.
[3064.62 --> 3065.44]  But with some of the
[3065.44 --> 3066.54]  great devices available
[3066.54 --> 3067.30]  on Windows Phone,
[3067.44 --> 3068.82]  like Nokia's latest flagship,
[3069.08 --> 3069.74]  which I can't remember
[3069.74 --> 3070.22]  what it's called,
[3070.36 --> 3071.40]  but it's really good
[3071.40 --> 3072.28]  and it's got a great camera.
[3073.58 --> 3076.30]  And Nokia's latest.
[3076.56 --> 3076.94]  OK,
[3077.04 --> 3077.72]  so there's only one.
[3077.72 --> 3078.86]  That's OK.
[3079.10 --> 3080.28]  I still really want
[3080.28 --> 3080.70]  to try it out.
[3082.54 --> 3083.90]  What else we got here?
[3084.26 --> 3084.76]  All right.
[3084.82 --> 3085.36]  Should we get into
[3085.36 --> 3086.48]  Microsoft is going to do
[3086.48 --> 3087.52]  more for PC gaming?
[3087.66 --> 3088.36]  Really, this time
[3088.36 --> 3088.90]  it's different.
[3089.04 --> 3089.74]  They're like an abusive
[3089.74 --> 3090.88]  spouse at this point.
[3091.84 --> 3092.28]  All right.
[3092.28 --> 3092.80]  So,
[3093.32 --> 3094.74]  this was originally
[3094.74 --> 3095.80]  posted on the forum
[3095.80 --> 3096.70]  by Johnners.
[3096.70 --> 3096.84]  At least there's
[3096.84 --> 3098.32]  some sort of
[3098.32 --> 3099.48]  actionable item in here.
[3099.60 --> 3099.78]  I,
[3100.04 --> 3100.60]  I,
[3100.82 --> 3101.36]  whatever.
[3101.80 --> 3102.84]  You go be a Microsoft
[3102.84 --> 3103.30]  fan.
[3103.34 --> 3103.90]  No, I know.
[3103.90 --> 3104.98]  Until I see
[3104.98 --> 3106.58]  some kind of action.
[3106.78 --> 3107.46]  I'm on your side.
[3107.76 --> 3108.66]  Are you on my side?
[3108.68 --> 3109.02]  I am.
[3109.06 --> 3109.78]  Because it didn't seem
[3109.78 --> 3110.42]  like it before
[3110.42 --> 3111.30]  when you were suggesting
[3111.30 --> 3111.94]  that we all start
[3111.94 --> 3113.34]  carrying PDAs around again.
[3116.54 --> 3117.88]  And that was why
[3117.88 --> 3119.00]  I had to abuse you.
[3120.66 --> 3121.80]  I hope you realize
[3121.80 --> 3122.62]  this is your fault.
[3122.94 --> 3124.68]  This is not a good way
[3124.68 --> 3125.12]  to go.
[3125.54 --> 3126.80]  Oh my God.
[3126.80 --> 3128.96]  This is why
[3128.96 --> 3129.86]  I have to hit you.
[3130.22 --> 3131.06]  This hurts me
[3131.06 --> 3131.88]  more than you.
[3134.72 --> 3135.16]  Horrible.
[3135.44 --> 3135.74]  Okay.
[3135.92 --> 3136.86]  Yeah, that is awful.
[3136.86 --> 3136.88]  That was probably
[3136.88 --> 3137.50]  not all right.
[3137.82 --> 3138.14]  Okay.
[3138.78 --> 3139.06]  So,
[3139.24 --> 3140.22]  Microsoft's recent
[3140.22 --> 3141.20]  acquisition of the
[3141.20 --> 3141.98]  PC-centric
[3141.98 --> 3142.86]  Rise of Nations
[3142.86 --> 3143.86]  franchise is just
[3143.86 --> 3144.56]  the first step
[3144.56 --> 3145.24]  in Microsoft's
[3145.24 --> 3145.92]  efforts to do
[3145.92 --> 3146.60]  more in the
[3146.60 --> 3147.86]  PC gaming space.
[3147.98 --> 3148.30]  Also known as Only.
[3148.80 --> 3149.68]  According to
[3149.68 --> 3150.52]  Xbox boss
[3150.52 --> 3151.22]  Phil Spencer,
[3151.50 --> 3152.12]  a fan asked
[3152.12 --> 3152.84]  Spencer on Twitter
[3152.84 --> 3153.44]  why Microsoft
[3153.44 --> 3153.98]  had acquired
[3153.98 --> 3154.62]  Rise of Nations
[3154.62 --> 3155.16]  and announced
[3155.16 --> 3155.72]  a re-release
[3155.72 --> 3156.16]  for Steam
[3156.16 --> 3156.60]  to which the
[3156.60 --> 3157.10]  veteran Xbox
[3157.10 --> 3157.80]  boss said
[3157.80 --> 3158.82]  Steam is a great
[3158.82 --> 3159.42]  place to sell
[3159.42 --> 3160.46]  Win32 games.
[3160.68 --> 3161.24]  We acquired
[3161.24 --> 3161.86]  the IP for
[3161.86 --> 3162.40]  future work.
[3162.52 --> 3163.14]  I'm a big fan
[3163.14 --> 3163.76]  of the franchise.
[3165.24 --> 3166.12]  The fan is
[3166.12 --> 3167.06]  apparently a Yahoo
[3167.06 --> 3168.34]  because this fan
[3168.34 --> 3169.18]  responded by saying
[3169.18 --> 3169.60]  they aren't
[3169.60 --> 3170.10]  interested in
[3170.10 --> 3171.04]  installing Steam.
[3173.78 --> 3174.48]  Praise be to
[3174.48 --> 3174.82]  GayBan.
[3175.30 --> 3176.28]  But would rather
[3176.28 --> 3177.36]  enjoy a Games for
[3177.36 --> 3178.00]  Windows Live
[3178.00 --> 3178.56]  replacement.
[3179.14 --> 3179.68]  Praise be to
[3179.68 --> 3179.98]  GayBan.
[3181.86 --> 3182.70]  Wait, wait,
[3182.76 --> 3182.92]  what?
[3183.14 --> 3183.32]  What?
[3183.50 --> 3183.84]  Really?
[3183.84 --> 3184.00]  You didn't read
[3184.00 --> 3184.58]  that part of this?
[3184.66 --> 3185.06]  Yeah, I was.
[3185.06 --> 3186.16]  The fan is
[3186.16 --> 3187.06]  basically off his
[3187.06 --> 3187.38]  rocker.
[3187.40 --> 3188.04]  So it's not a
[3188.04 --> 3188.34]  fan.
[3188.46 --> 3188.86]  This is a
[3188.86 --> 3189.78]  planted person.
[3189.98 --> 3190.74]  I have no idea.
[3190.74 --> 3191.48]  I have never
[3191.48 --> 3192.78]  met or talked
[3192.78 --> 3193.38]  to a single
[3193.38 --> 3194.22]  person ever
[3194.22 --> 3194.78]  that has thought
[3194.78 --> 3195.50]  Games for
[3195.50 --> 3195.86]  Windows Live
[3195.86 --> 3196.40]  was anything
[3196.40 --> 3196.74]  other than
[3196.74 --> 3197.32]  No, Microsoft
[3197.32 --> 3197.70]  has already
[3197.70 --> 3198.30]  said they're
[3198.30 --> 3199.26]  not expecting
[3199.26 --> 3200.32]  to create a
[3200.32 --> 3201.00]  direct competitor
[3201.00 --> 3201.60]  for Steam
[3201.60 --> 3202.16]  and they
[3202.16 --> 3202.54]  shouldn't.
[3202.64 --> 3203.08]  I'd like to
[3203.08 --> 3203.52]  see more
[3203.52 --> 3204.48]  collaboration
[3204.48 --> 3205.42]  between
[3205.42 --> 3206.04]  Yeah, we've
[3206.04 --> 3206.38]  brought up
[3206.38 --> 3207.04]  about how
[3207.04 --> 3208.26]  Ubisoft needs
[3208.26 --> 3209.00]  to give up
[3209.00 --> 3209.72]  and re-skin
[3209.72 --> 3210.22]  Steam.
[3210.86 --> 3211.78]  Okay, so at
[3211.78 --> 3212.32]  any rate
[3212.32 --> 3214.78]  This article
[3214.78 --> 3215.58]  blah blah blah
[3215.58 --> 3216.48]  etc etc
[3216.48 --> 3217.08]  Microsoft
[3217.08 --> 3218.14]  whatever has
[3218.14 --> 3218.74]  committed more
[3218.74 --> 3219.70]  DirectX 12
[3219.70 --> 3220.26]  blah blah blah
[3220.26 --> 3221.74]  So this is great
[3221.74 --> 3223.12]  someone brought
[3223.12 --> 3223.50]  this to
[3223.50 --> 3223.88]  Johnner's
[3223.88 --> 3224.24]  attention
[3224.24 --> 3225.24]  and it was
[3225.24 --> 3225.82]  added to the
[3225.82 --> 3226.54]  original post
[3226.54 --> 3227.04]  it's a post
[3227.04 --> 3228.08]  from 2013
[3228.08 --> 3229.46]  that chronicles
[3229.46 --> 3230.24]  all the times
[3230.24 --> 3230.82]  that Microsoft
[3230.82 --> 3231.80]  has said this
[3231.80 --> 3232.94]  In 2005
[3232.94 --> 3233.82]  we care about
[3233.82 --> 3234.54]  PC gaming
[3234.54 --> 3235.22]  Longhorn
[3235.22 --> 3235.80]  that's the
[3235.80 --> 3236.10]  code name
[3236.10 --> 3236.60]  for Vista
[3236.60 --> 3238.22]  blah blah blah
[3238.22 --> 3239.08]  to usher in
[3239.08 --> 3239.94]  modern PC gaming
[3239.94 --> 3241.14]  with Trey and Play
[3241.14 --> 3241.62]  Do you guys
[3241.62 --> 3242.10]  remember that
[3242.10 --> 3242.98]  games folder
[3242.98 --> 3244.34]  for Vista
[3244.34 --> 3245.32]  that is gone
[3245.32 --> 3245.66]  now?
[3245.92 --> 3246.38]  Okay, well
[3246.38 --> 3247.12]  Vista launched
[3247.12 --> 3247.64]  with none of
[3247.64 --> 3248.08]  the stuff they
[3248.08 --> 3248.52]  promised
[3248.52 --> 3249.96]  Vista was not
[3249.96 --> 3250.40]  popular
[3250.40 --> 3251.54]  2006
[3251.54 --> 3252.30]  I think actually
[3252.30 --> 3253.00]  what the article
[3253.00 --> 3253.84]  says is Vista
[3253.84 --> 3254.58]  itself sucks
[3254.58 --> 3255.14]  the ass of
[3255.14 --> 3256.06]  a thousand camels
[3256.06 --> 3257.04]  but I decided
[3257.04 --> 3258.60]  to make that
[3258.60 --> 3259.56]  not quite as
[3259.56 --> 3260.22]  But then you
[3260.22 --> 3260.74]  just said
[3260.74 --> 3261.80]  That's true
[3261.80 --> 3262.26]  I did
[3262.26 --> 3263.28]  but it was
[3263.28 --> 3264.58]  a direct quote
[3264.58 --> 3267.56]  Alright, so
[3267.56 --> 3268.14]  in 2006
[3268.14 --> 3268.16]  That wouldn't have
[3268.16 --> 3268.80]  changed saying it
[3268.80 --> 3269.62]  in the first place
[3269.62 --> 3270.26]  2006
[3270.26 --> 3271.30]  Microsoft says
[3271.30 --> 3272.28]  don't count
[3272.28 --> 3273.14]  PC games out
[3273.14 --> 3273.72]  and they announced
[3273.72 --> 3274.40]  Games for Windows
[3274.40 --> 3274.74]  Live
[3274.74 --> 3275.26]  talk about how
[3275.26 --> 3276.02]  amazing it will be
[3276.02 --> 3276.98]  In 2007
[3276.98 --> 3277.86]  they continued
[3277.86 --> 3278.60]  the PC push
[3278.60 --> 3279.18]  they launched
[3279.18 --> 3279.74]  Games for Windows
[3279.74 --> 3280.06]  Live
[3280.06 --> 3280.68]  with a $50
[3280.68 --> 3281.78]  a year fee
[3281.78 --> 3282.90]  Genius
[3282.90 --> 3284.70]  Thanks for saving
[3284.70 --> 3285.70]  gaming
[3285.70 --> 3286.88]  They also announced
[3286.88 --> 3287.62]  a whole slew
[3287.62 --> 3288.82]  of games to include
[3288.82 --> 3290.54]  Shadowrun with
[3290.54 --> 3291.60]  cross-platform play
[3291.60 --> 3292.62]  and Gears of War 1
[3292.62 --> 3293.26]  and blah blah blah
[3293.26 --> 3294.12]  cross-platform play
[3294.12 --> 3294.86]  What happened
[3294.86 --> 3296.18]  to cross-platform play?
[3296.30 --> 3296.70]  They realized
[3296.70 --> 3297.68]  that PC gamers
[3297.68 --> 3297.98]  were going to
[3297.98 --> 3298.58]  destroy everyone
[3298.58 --> 3300.42]  I'm sorry if you're
[3300.42 --> 3300.88]  a console gamer
[3300.88 --> 3301.28]  in the audience
[3301.28 --> 3302.38]  but I'm so much
[3302.38 --> 3303.50]  faster with a keyboard
[3303.50 --> 3303.90]  and mouse
[3303.90 --> 3306.92]  It's not going to
[3306.92 --> 3307.26]  happen
[3307.26 --> 3307.94]  2008
[3307.94 --> 3309.58]  Yay, we got rid
[3309.58 --> 3310.02]  of the $50
[3310.02 --> 3310.88]  a year fee
[3310.88 --> 3311.58]  See, we're serious
[3311.58 --> 3312.40]  about PC gaming
[3312.40 --> 3313.10]  2008
[3313.10 --> 3314.28]  PC gaming's not dead
[3314.28 --> 3315.02]  Look at this event
[3315.02 --> 3315.54]  we're throwing
[3315.54 --> 3316.60]  2008
[3316.60 --> 3318.20]  All new games
[3318.20 --> 3318.96]  for Windows Live
[3318.96 --> 3320.26]  It's got a new skin
[3320.26 --> 3321.32]  2009
[3321.32 --> 3322.46]  PC gaming is still
[3322.46 --> 3323.38]  a priority for us
[3323.38 --> 3324.52]  It's really vital for us
[3324.52 --> 3325.62]  We're still serious, guys
[3325.62 --> 3326.62]  2010
[3326.62 --> 3328.04]  We're doubling down
[3328.04 --> 3329.14]  which means
[3329.14 --> 3329.94]  Games for Windows Live
[3329.94 --> 3330.64]  is still here
[3330.64 --> 3331.74]  and we'll update
[3331.74 --> 3332.48]  some stuff
[3332.48 --> 3334.02]  to fix the problem
[3334.02 --> 3334.60]  of game saves
[3334.60 --> 3335.54]  being deleted
[3335.54 --> 3337.22]  2010
[3337.22 --> 3338.78]  Games for Windows Live
[3338.78 --> 3339.76]  Marketplace
[3339.76 --> 3341.28]  These are all things
[3341.28 --> 3341.38]  we've never wanted
[3341.38 --> 3341.90]  2010
[3341.90 --> 3342.74]  Windows 8
[3342.74 --> 3343.16]  is going to
[3343.16 --> 3344.20]  relaunch gaming
[3344.20 --> 3346.06]  just like we promised
[3346.06 --> 3347.04]  back in 2006
[3347.04 --> 3347.90]  2012
[3347.90 --> 3348.94]  We won't ditch
[3348.94 --> 3349.72]  games for Windows Live
[3349.72 --> 3350.30]  2013
[3350.30 --> 3351.50]  We're discontinuing
[3351.50 --> 3352.20]  Windows Live
[3352.20 --> 3352.90]  Thank you
[3352.90 --> 3354.14]  2013
[3354.14 --> 3355.92]  Microsoft promises
[3355.92 --> 3356.88]  core first party
[3356.88 --> 3357.96]  games coming to PC
[3357.96 --> 3360.10]  so forgive me
[3360.10 --> 3362.40]  if I give exactly
[3362.40 --> 3363.62]  zero craps
[3363.62 --> 3365.16]  about Microsoft's
[3365.16 --> 3366.34]  recommitment to the PC
[3366.34 --> 3367.64]  because it really just
[3367.64 --> 3368.88]  I mean, you look at
[3368.88 --> 3369.94]  the rumors circulating
[3369.94 --> 3371.34]  about how
[3371.34 --> 3372.14]  you know
[3372.14 --> 3373.16]  there's at least
[3373.16 --> 3373.92]  some discussion
[3373.92 --> 3375.08]  about canning
[3375.08 --> 3375.56]  the Xbox
[3375.56 --> 3376.64]  division altogether
[3376.64 --> 3377.76]  never mind
[3377.76 --> 3378.56]  PC gaming
[3378.56 --> 3379.16]  which was the
[3379.16 --> 3380.22]  red-headed stepchild
[3380.22 --> 3381.44]  eight years ago
[3381.44 --> 3383.96]  I mean, okay
[3383.96 --> 3385.54]  with all of that said
[3385.54 --> 3387.26]  with all of that said
[3387.26 --> 3388.40]  anyway, blah blah blah
[3388.40 --> 3388.96]  Spencer says
[3388.96 --> 3389.98]  part of my Xbox role
[3389.98 --> 3390.52]  is to bring back
[3390.52 --> 3391.68]  our Windows gaming focus
[3391.68 --> 3392.72]  I mean, there is
[3392.72 --> 3393.00]  there
[3393.00 --> 3395.36]  the opportunity
[3395.36 --> 3396.60]  has been missed
[3396.60 --> 3398.58]  time upon time
[3398.58 --> 3399.68]  with the original Xbox
[3399.68 --> 3400.82]  there was an opportunity
[3400.82 --> 3403.02]  to get Xboxes rolled out
[3403.02 --> 3404.74]  as media streamers
[3404.74 --> 3405.74]  which actually
[3405.74 --> 3407.16]  there are still some
[3407.16 --> 3408.08]  deployed today
[3408.08 --> 3409.84]  as media streaming boxes
[3409.84 --> 3411.14]  to get rolled out
[3411.14 --> 3412.00]  as an inexpensive
[3412.00 --> 3413.12]  media streaming box
[3413.12 --> 3414.14]  that happens to also
[3414.14 --> 3415.70]  be a cheapo gaming console
[3415.70 --> 3417.08]  and then to bring
[3417.08 --> 3418.34]  that library of games
[3418.34 --> 3419.24]  to PC gamers
[3419.24 --> 3420.76]  and Xbox gamers alike
[3420.76 --> 3422.04]  throw mouse and keyboard
[3422.04 --> 3423.46]  compatibility at the Xbox
[3423.46 --> 3424.32]  so that there isn't
[3424.32 --> 3425.64]  that inherent disadvantage
[3425.64 --> 3427.58]  and make it all
[3427.58 --> 3429.24]  one big ecosystem
[3429.24 --> 3430.14]  which would have been amazing
[3430.14 --> 3430.82]  then go and add
[3430.82 --> 3431.66]  Windows phone
[3431.66 --> 3432.28]  and tablet
[3432.28 --> 3433.44]  and all this stuff to it
[3433.44 --> 3435.10]  to keep things segregated
[3435.10 --> 3435.92]  the way they do
[3435.92 --> 3437.54]  never made any sense to me
[3437.54 --> 3438.70]  what could they have
[3438.70 --> 3439.84]  possibly been thinking
[3439.84 --> 3441.40]  developing games
[3441.40 --> 3443.16]  for just one platform
[3443.16 --> 3443.98]  instead of
[3443.98 --> 3445.18]  all the platforms
[3445.18 --> 3446.24]  I mean, you look at
[3446.24 --> 3446.98]  what Microsoft
[3446.98 --> 3448.40]  has invested
[3448.40 --> 3449.64]  in the typical
[3449.64 --> 3451.06]  in a typical PC
[3451.06 --> 3451.72]  okay, so
[3451.72 --> 3452.86]  let's say they develop
[3452.86 --> 3453.76]  a piece of software
[3453.76 --> 3454.84]  let's say for example
[3454.84 --> 3455.40]  Halo
[3455.40 --> 3456.28]  okay
[3456.28 --> 3457.62]  Halo 2
[3457.62 --> 3458.28]  or whatever
[3458.28 --> 3459.08]  doesn't matter
[3459.08 --> 3460.14]  the point is
[3460.14 --> 3461.14]  if they could sell that
[3461.14 --> 3462.60]  to any PC user
[3462.60 --> 3464.04]  or any Xbox user
[3464.04 --> 3466.62]  why do they care?
[3467.02 --> 3467.60]  I even would've
[3467.60 --> 3468.92]  even if they had it separate
[3468.92 --> 3469.68]  I even would've bought
[3469.68 --> 3470.24]  two copies
[3470.24 --> 3471.02]  so there's the benefit
[3471.02 --> 3471.98]  there's the benefit
[3471.98 --> 3472.98]  of selling someone an Xbox
[3472.98 --> 3474.64]  to which I would kind of go
[3474.64 --> 3475.54]  okay
[3475.54 --> 3476.78]  that's a benefit
[3476.78 --> 3478.02]  but I don't think
[3478.02 --> 3479.72]  particularly near the launch
[3479.72 --> 3481.12]  you're making anywhere near
[3481.12 --> 3482.00]  $70
[3482.00 --> 3483.10]  I think it's about
[3483.10 --> 3483.64]  $60
[3483.64 --> 3484.46]  $50 to $60
[3484.46 --> 3485.46]  is what they
[3485.46 --> 3486.64]  is what a tier 1
[3486.64 --> 3487.90]  pays for a Windows license
[3487.90 --> 3488.92]  so I don't think
[3488.92 --> 3489.60]  you're really even
[3489.60 --> 3490.24]  making that much
[3490.24 --> 3490.78]  on the hardware
[3490.78 --> 3492.04]  and then
[3492.04 --> 3493.92]  if it's a PC
[3493.92 --> 3494.72]  well then you made
[3494.72 --> 3495.66]  that much on it
[3495.66 --> 3496.32]  so what do you
[3496.32 --> 3497.22]  what do you care?
[3497.88 --> 3498.64]  you should just want
[3498.64 --> 3499.90]  a bigger installer base
[3499.90 --> 3501.08]  and a bigger community
[3501.08 --> 3502.48]  for your fans
[3502.48 --> 3503.68]  and not alienate
[3503.68 --> 3504.58]  all of the people
[3504.58 --> 3505.86]  that trump for your platform
[3505.86 --> 3506.78]  so hard
[3506.78 --> 3508.10]  like there's
[3508.10 --> 3509.74]  I know so many families
[3509.74 --> 3510.66]  where their mom and dad
[3510.66 --> 3511.20]  are just like
[3511.20 --> 3511.82]  yeah we should just get
[3511.82 --> 3512.20]  an iMac
[3512.20 --> 3513.02]  and the kid's like
[3513.02 --> 3513.90]  no
[3513.90 --> 3516.30]  please no
[3516.30 --> 3517.36]  and then they get a PC
[3517.36 --> 3518.84]  and it's like
[3518.84 --> 3519.74]  this is why
[3519.74 --> 3520.68]  your installer base
[3520.68 --> 3521.62]  is really large
[3521.62 --> 3522.72]  like come on
[3522.72 --> 3523.48]  one of the reasons
[3523.48 --> 3524.20]  one yeah
[3524.20 --> 3525.14]  one of the reasons
[3525.14 --> 3526.06]  alright so
[3526.06 --> 3527.44]  more bad Microsoft news
[3527.44 --> 3528.14]  before we have
[3528.14 --> 3529.24]  good Microsoft stuff
[3529.24 --> 3530.82]  Microsoft confirms
[3530.82 --> 3531.74]  the Xbox One
[3531.74 --> 3532.58]  is more powerful
[3532.58 --> 3533.54]  without the Kinect
[3533.54 --> 3534.06]  hooked up
[3534.06 --> 3535.72]  so this is posted
[3535.72 --> 3536.12]  on the forum
[3536.12 --> 3537.08]  by misanthrope
[3537.08 --> 3539.28]  this ties into a video
[3539.28 --> 3539.74]  that we have
[3539.74 --> 3540.40]  coming shortly
[3540.40 --> 3541.98]  yeah so they figure
[3541.98 --> 3543.46]  it's about 10%
[3543.46 --> 3545.02]  10% additional
[3545.02 --> 3546.04]  GPU performance
[3546.04 --> 3546.72]  can be
[3546.72 --> 3547.82]  can be gained
[3547.82 --> 3548.52]  which is like
[3548.52 --> 3549.70]  kind of huge
[3549.70 --> 3551.44]  it's sort of a big deal
[3551.44 --> 3552.18]  um
[3552.18 --> 3554.82]  like wow
[3554.82 --> 3556.40]  I mean it's not
[3556.40 --> 3557.26]  going to be the difference
[3557.26 --> 3558.28]  between running
[3558.28 --> 3559.12]  at 30fps
[3559.12 --> 3559.96]  and 60fps
[3559.96 --> 3561.12]  and we have a really
[3561.12 --> 3562.12]  great video coming
[3562.12 --> 3563.16]  probably in a couple weeks
[3563.16 --> 3563.88]  that's going to be
[3563.88 --> 3564.70]  about that
[3564.70 --> 3565.54]  but it might be the
[3565.54 --> 3566.08]  difference between
[3566.08 --> 3566.78]  running at like
[3566.78 --> 3567.34]  what is it
[3567.34 --> 3568.88]  882p
[3568.88 --> 3569.72]  yeah
[3569.72 --> 3571.34]  and a real resolution
[3571.34 --> 3572.40]  like 1080p
[3572.40 --> 3574.06]  um
[3574.06 --> 3575.00]  there was a couple
[3575.00 --> 3575.96]  yeah so this is
[3575.96 --> 3576.60]  there's a great post
[3576.60 --> 3577.78]  from DLF on the forum
[3577.78 --> 3579.20]  we can't just turn off
[3579.20 --> 3579.80]  the DRM
[3579.80 --> 3580.64]  and I don't believe
[3580.64 --> 3581.44]  that was actually
[3581.44 --> 3582.36]  Xbox One
[3582.36 --> 3583.64]  I think that was
[3583.64 --> 3584.22]  uh that was a
[3584.22 --> 3585.44]  that was Xbox 360
[3585.44 --> 3585.96]  or something
[3585.96 --> 3586.28]  okay
[3586.28 --> 3587.18]  and then we can't
[3587.18 --> 3588.14]  just disable Kinect
[3588.14 --> 3589.46]  we won't sell Xbox One
[3589.46 --> 3590.12]  without Kinect
[3590.12 --> 3591.52]  does all of those things
[3591.52 --> 3594.54]  but you know what
[3594.54 --> 3596.22]  I am proud of
[3596.22 --> 3597.28]  consumers right now
[3597.28 --> 3598.28]  for speaking with
[3598.28 --> 3598.94]  their wallets
[3598.94 --> 3600.38]  because um
[3600.38 --> 3600.70]  what
[3600.70 --> 3601.20]  they're not really
[3601.20 --> 3601.96]  buying Xboxes
[3601.96 --> 3602.14]  yeah
[3602.14 --> 3603.08]  Dead Rising 3
[3603.08 --> 3604.32]  is coming to PC now
[3604.32 --> 3605.06]  is it
[3605.06 --> 3605.46]  yeah
[3605.46 --> 3606.80]  so by just
[3606.80 --> 3607.74]  refusing
[3607.74 --> 3608.90]  to settle
[3608.90 --> 3610.02]  for an inferior
[3610.02 --> 3610.90]  experience
[3610.90 --> 3612.80]  we are forcing
[3612.80 --> 3613.46]  them to be
[3613.46 --> 3614.46]  friendlier to us
[3614.46 --> 3615.58]  and to win back
[3615.58 --> 3616.12]  our favor
[3616.12 --> 3617.06]  well in PC gaming
[3617.06 --> 3617.76]  it's just like
[3617.76 --> 3618.96]  you guys keep on
[3618.96 --> 3619.68]  thinking we're going

[3628.06 --> 3629.02]  I was talking to
[3629.02 --> 3630.06]  someone who's
[3630.06 --> 3630.84]  fairly close to me
[3630.84 --> 3631.34]  that didn't know
[3631.34 --> 3631.88]  what League of Legends
[3631.88 --> 3632.82]  was and it reminded
[3632.82 --> 3633.82]  me of the discussion
[3633.82 --> 3634.78]  that we had in the
[3634.78 --> 3636.20]  garage way back
[3636.20 --> 3636.84]  a long time ago
[3636.84 --> 3637.52]  about whether League
[3637.52 --> 3638.06]  of Legends is
[3638.06 --> 3638.40]  mainstream
[3638.40 --> 3638.82]  yeah
[3638.82 --> 3639.50]  yeah it's not
[3639.50 --> 3640.64]  no it's not
[3640.64 --> 3641.58]  no it's not
[3641.58 --> 3642.54]  that's so weird
[3642.54 --> 3642.90]  yeah
[3642.90 --> 3643.76]  wait
[3643.76 --> 3644.92]  did I get
[3644.92 --> 3645.88]  did I get a straw
[3645.88 --> 3646.76]  poll to determine
[3646.76 --> 3647.96]  that that you're an
[3647.96 --> 3649.00]  idiot and did I get
[3649.00 --> 3650.02]  an admission that I'm
[3650.02 --> 3651.10]  right on the same
[3651.10 --> 3651.70]  WAN show
[3651.70 --> 3653.82]  this is fantastic
[3653.82 --> 3655.06]  can I have a fist bump
[3655.06 --> 3655.52]  for it too
[3655.52 --> 3655.62]  no
[3655.62 --> 3656.56]  you're not going to
[3656.56 --> 3657.48]  complete the like
[3657.48 --> 3658.60]  the hat trick
[3658.60 --> 3658.88]  no
[3658.88 --> 3660.24]  I can't give you
[3660.24 --> 3660.80]  all three
[3660.80 --> 3662.88]  make the audience
[3662.88 --> 3664.00]  put him down
[3664.00 --> 3665.90]  have him put himself
[3665.90 --> 3666.82]  down and then have
[3666.82 --> 3667.70]  him congratulate me
[3667.70 --> 3667.90]  for it
[3667.90 --> 3668.58]  well no it's just
[3668.58 --> 3669.52]  it's how amazed
[3669.52 --> 3670.16]  that I was
[3670.16 --> 3670.88]  because at that
[3670.88 --> 3671.34]  point in time
[3671.34 --> 3671.92]  I had proved you
[3671.92 --> 3672.60]  wrong because you
[3672.60 --> 3673.34]  said the last person
[3673.34 --> 3673.66]  that would know
[3673.66 --> 3674.24]  but it would be
[3674.24 --> 3674.66]  wrong
[3674.66 --> 3674.94]  proved
[3674.94 --> 3676.26]  oh that's
[3676.26 --> 3677.32]  this was your
[3677.32 --> 3678.30]  you won the battle
[3678.30 --> 3679.54]  yeah this was your
[3679.54 --> 3680.02]  decision
[3680.02 --> 3681.08]  yeah okay
[3681.08 --> 3682.30]  and then my wife
[3682.30 --> 3683.04]  knew what it was
[3683.04 --> 3683.64]  and then I won
[3683.64 --> 3684.90]  but then this was
[3684.90 --> 3685.78]  yeah this is the
[3685.78 --> 3686.44]  first person that
[3686.44 --> 3686.98]  I've ever met
[3686.98 --> 3687.62]  that didn't know
[3687.62 --> 3688.04]  what it was
[3688.04 --> 3688.50]  right
[3688.50 --> 3689.92]  but it's like the
[3689.92 --> 3690.50]  first person I've
[3690.50 --> 3691.02]  ever met that is
[3691.02 --> 3691.98]  like outside of
[3691.98 --> 3692.72]  yeah
[3692.72 --> 3694.04]  and okay ever as
[3694.04 --> 3694.74]  in like the last
[3694.74 --> 3695.16]  few years
[3695.16 --> 3695.74]  I know you know
[3695.74 --> 3696.74]  it's funny because
[3696.74 --> 3698.78]  I uh we it's you
[3698.78 --> 3699.96]  don't think about
[3699.96 --> 3702.56]  how isolated or
[3702.56 --> 3703.84]  like how how
[3703.84 --> 3704.90]  inside of a box
[3704.90 --> 3705.90]  how segmented
[3705.90 --> 3707.36]  people are
[3707.36 --> 3707.60]  yeah
[3707.60 --> 3708.36]  and the way that
[3708.36 --> 3709.70]  social circles work
[3709.70 --> 3710.78]  yeah like it's
[3710.78 --> 3711.84]  funny because I've
[3711.84 --> 3712.20]  had a few
[3712.20 --> 3712.94]  experiences like

[3896.62 --> 3897.56]  guys there as well

[3931.32 --> 3932.12]  down in price
[3932.12 --> 3933.72]  the high performance
[3933.72 --> 3934.44]  ones are making
[3934.44 --> 3935.32]  less and less sense
[3935.32 --> 3936.62]  every day and the
[3936.62 --> 3937.32]  good bang for the

[3957.28 --> 3958.46]  that yeah that's
[3958.46 --> 3959.02]  cool you're not
[3959.02 --> 3959.48]  going to actually
[3959.48 --> 3960.38]  have one when you
[3960.38 --> 3960.86]  go on the trip
[3960.86 --> 3961.92]  unfortunately yet I
[3961.92 --> 3962.66]  would have deaths
[3962.66 --> 3963.84]  just put it on top
[3963.84 --> 3964.72]  and you know that I
[3964.72 --> 3965.84]  know you would and
[3965.84 --> 3967.04]  then finally our
[3967.04 --> 3968.02]  last sponsor is
[3968.02 --> 3969.98]  NCIX your source
[3969.98 --> 3971.00]  for great technology
[3971.00 --> 3972.62]  selection and service
[3972.62 --> 3973.98]  also known as
[3973.98 --> 3975.00]  they're my bros
[3975.00 --> 3975.78]  you should buy your
[3975.78 --> 3976.74]  computer stuff there
[3976.74 --> 3977.46]  because they're my
[3977.46 --> 3978.36]  bros I worked there
[3978.36 --> 3979.82]  for five years I
[3979.82 --> 3980.72]  still work with them
[3980.72 --> 3981.98]  very very closely I
[3981.98 --> 3982.76]  love those guys
[3982.76 --> 3983.72]  they're great guys
[3983.72 --> 3984.76]  you know the thing
[3984.76 --> 3986.22]  about NCIX is they
[3986.22 --> 3986.92]  don't always do
[3986.92 --> 3988.84]  everything perfect but
[3988.84 --> 3989.86]  it's great technology
[3989.86 --> 3991.18]  selection and service
[3991.18 --> 3992.54]  if you reach out to
[3992.54 --> 3994.18]  them and if you are
[3994.18 --> 3995.58]  they're fair they'll
[3995.58 --> 3996.44]  be fair to you
[3996.44 --> 3997.06]  they'll do their
[3997.06 --> 3998.34]  best they always they
[3998.34 --> 3999.34]  always do their best
[3999.34 --> 4000.26]  to fix it no matter
[4000.26 --> 4001.56]  what it is and that's
[4001.56 --> 4002.04]  something that you
[4002.04 --> 4002.88]  can't say about every
[4002.88 --> 4004.46]  company so having been
[4004.46 --> 4005.74]  on the inside there I
[4005.74 --> 4007.00]  know how things work and
[4007.00 --> 4007.86]  I know that they really
[4007.86 --> 4009.36]  do care so there you
[4009.36 --> 4010.20]  go that's my
[4010.20 --> 4011.50]  endorsement of NCIX
[4011.50 --> 4012.62]  someone suggested that
[4012.62 --> 4013.54]  we get Lauren to go on
[4013.54 --> 4014.24]  the climb with us
[4014.24 --> 4017.84]  she didn't want to come
[4017.84 --> 4018.64]  on the WAN show did
[4018.64 --> 4018.84]  she?
[4019.00 --> 4019.28]  no
[4019.28 --> 4020.46]  so I don't know
[4020.46 --> 4021.34]  I don't know tell
[4021.34 --> 4022.96]  you what we'll ask
[4022.96 --> 4025.30]  her okay we'll see
[4025.30 --> 4026.76]  we'll see I have a
[4026.76 --> 4027.42]  feeling our videos
[4027.42 --> 4028.20]  would get many more
[4028.20 --> 4030.86]  views I have a feeling
[4030.86 --> 4032.54]  that that is a
[4032.54 --> 4035.42]  stereotype okay that
[4035.42 --> 4036.98]  gamers think women are
[4036.98 --> 4038.18]  attractive and watch
[4038.18 --> 4038.90]  videos with them in
[4038.90 --> 4040.00]  this is this is
[4040.00 --> 4041.46]  actually this is
[4041.46 --> 4042.40]  unrelated to Tasty
[4042.40 --> 4043.48]  PC this is related to
[4043.48 --> 4044.10]  what you just said
[4044.10 --> 4044.88]  about watching videos
[4044.88 --> 4045.82]  with women in them
[4045.82 --> 4047.18]  have you not seen the
[4047.18 --> 4048.34]  like browser streamers
[4048.34 --> 4051.52]  on Twitch like are
[4051.52 --> 4052.16]  you are you kidding
[4052.16 --> 4053.34]  me right now you
[4053.34 --> 4054.22]  can't even make that
[4054.22 --> 4056.62]  argument I didn't say
[4056.62 --> 4058.04]  that it was invalid
[4058.04 --> 4060.00]  I said it was a
[4060.00 --> 4061.02]  stereotype I didn't
[4061.02 --> 4064.40]  say no you never say
[4064.40 --> 4064.86]  no
[4064.86 --> 4071.14]  speaking of saying
[4071.14 --> 4073.30]  no all the no in the
[4073.30 --> 4075.38]  world to this Apple
[4075.38 --> 4077.20]  defines a spec for
[4077.20 --> 4078.82]  lightning connector
[4078.82 --> 4081.02]  headphones with 48
[4081.02 --> 4082.22]  kilohertz output
[4082.22 --> 4085.46]  Apple piss off we do
[4085.46 --> 4087.68]  not need we do not
[4087.68 --> 4089.36]  need headphones with
[4089.36 --> 4091.04]  proprietary connectors
[4091.04 --> 4092.64]  that is not a thing we
[4092.64 --> 4094.24]  need please don't make
[4094.24 --> 4095.56]  it if you stop making
[4095.56 --> 4096.74]  i devices with analog
[4096.74 --> 4099.62]  outputs I will well I
[4099.62 --> 4100.98]  don't buy any anyway but
[4100.98 --> 4103.34]  I will definitely continue
[4103.34 --> 4105.16]  not buying them because
[4105.16 --> 4107.04]  that's absolutely horrible
[4107.04 --> 4109.88]  and to get caught up in
[4109.88 --> 4112.24]  some kind of a in some
[4112.24 --> 4113.94]  kind of a like race to
[4113.94 --> 4115.38]  who can have the highest
[4115.38 --> 4116.92]  sample rate on their
[4116.92 --> 4119.32]  files is a journey to
[4119.32 --> 4120.54]  nowhere because it
[4120.54 --> 4121.98]  doesn't actually matter
[4121.98 --> 4123.04]  past a certain point
[4123.04 --> 4124.98]  also there is there is
[4124.98 --> 4127.30]  no there's no reason why
[4127.30 --> 4128.42]  you can't have an
[4128.42 --> 4129.98]  excellent DAC and an
[4129.98 --> 4131.68]  analog connection to the
[4131.68 --> 4132.88]  speakers that sit inside
[4132.88 --> 4133.92]  your ears because
[4133.92 --> 4135.30]  effectively that's all
[4135.30 --> 4136.78]  that you're doing anyway
[4136.78 --> 4138.84]  a digital headphone is
[4138.84 --> 4139.94]  just one that has the
[4139.94 --> 4141.24]  DAC on the other side
[4141.24 --> 4142.40]  of the cable instead of
[4142.40 --> 4144.44]  having the DAC here and
[4144.44 --> 4145.88]  then over there the amp
[4145.88 --> 4147.04]  and DAC actually both of
[4147.04 --> 4148.18]  them I suppose it
[4148.18 --> 4149.58]  doesn't matter it's still
[4149.58 --> 4151.10]  a speaker is an
[4151.10 --> 4152.54]  inherently analog thing
[4152.54 --> 4153.96]  there is no benefit to
[4153.96 --> 4155.44]  this other than that we
[4155.44 --> 4156.74]  are going to be stuck
[4156.74 --> 4158.66]  with headphones that only
[4158.66 --> 4160.80]  work with iPhones and
[4160.80 --> 4162.20]  iPhones that I mean if
[4162.20 --> 4162.98]  they were to actually
[4162.98 --> 4164.04]  take the three and a
[4164.04 --> 4165.26]  half inch connector off
[4165.26 --> 4166.36]  then we'd be stuck with
[4166.36 --> 4167.82]  iPhones that only work
[4167.82 --> 4169.44]  with stupid lightning
[4169.44 --> 4170.94]  headphones most of which
[4170.94 --> 4172.56]  will be fashion trash I'm
[4172.56 --> 4173.64]  sure well beats they'll
[4173.64 --> 4175.02]  be beats well though I'm
[4175.02 --> 4175.94]  sure someone else will
[4175.94 --> 4177.96]  participate in the made
[4177.96 --> 4178.86]  for I yeah but I'm like
[4178.86 --> 4179.56]  I think they're making
[4179.56 --> 4181.16]  sure that there will be a
[4181.16 --> 4182.34]  range of products on
[4182.34 --> 4183.16]  launch for this picture
[4183.16 --> 4184.44]  this future and I'm about
[4184.44 --> 4185.58]  to make your brain melt
[4185.58 --> 4187.44]  okay this already did you
[4187.44 --> 4188.72]  look at the kinds of like
[4188.72 --> 4189.96]  real companies like
[4189.96 --> 4191.16]  serious companies that
[4191.16 --> 4192.80]  really care like Sennheiser
[4192.80 --> 4194.54]  that participate in the
[4194.54 --> 4195.80]  made for iPhone program
[4195.80 --> 4196.90]  like the momentum
[4196.90 --> 4198.12]  headphones for example
[4198.12 --> 4199.96]  why is Sennheiser targeting
[4199.96 --> 4201.14]  iPhone users with these
[4201.14 --> 4202.88]  because iPhone users will
[4202.88 --> 4204.30]  pay more yeah okay
[4204.30 --> 4205.72]  Sennheiser happened to
[4205.72 --> 4207.10]  make legitimately good
[4207.10 --> 4208.16]  headphones that are made
[4208.16 --> 4209.48]  for iPhone but it means
[4209.48 --> 4210.46]  that the inline controls
[4210.46 --> 4211.32]  don't work on Android
[4211.32 --> 4212.22]  because they're made for
[4212.22 --> 4213.74]  iPhone now imagine this
[4213.74 --> 4215.24]  imagine Sennheiser is put
[4215.24 --> 4216.98]  in a position where they
[4216.98 --> 4218.50]  have to decide are they
[4218.50 --> 4220.02]  making their next pair of
[4220.02 --> 4221.34]  great sounding but still
[4221.34 --> 4222.54]  fashionable headphones with
[4222.54 --> 4223.88]  a lightning connector or a
[4223.88 --> 4224.24]  three and a half
[4224.24 --> 4224.82]  millimeter connector
[4224.82 --> 4226.00]  could this become a
[4226.00 --> 4228.86]  breakaway I don't know
[4228.86 --> 4230.12]  maybe because that would
[4230.12 --> 4231.00]  make sense but that's
[4231.00 --> 4232.24]  totally inelegant and
[4232.24 --> 4233.30]  that's not that's not
[4233.30 --> 4234.60]  it's true the Apple way
[4234.60 --> 4235.86]  like that's not going to
[4235.86 --> 4236.86]  it could be breakaway and
[4236.86 --> 4237.68]  it doesn't have to be
[4237.68 --> 4239.56]  breakaway like okay well
[4239.56 --> 4240.46]  Apple's already said there
[4240.46 --> 4241.94]  will be adapters so yes you
[4241.94 --> 4243.64]  can adapt your lightning to
[4243.64 --> 4244.58]  make a three and a half but
[4244.58 --> 4246.14]  that's stupid oh it is yeah
[4246.14 --> 4248.24]  like adapters are horrible
[4248.24 --> 4249.12]  it could be breakaway like
[4249.12 --> 4252.14]  it is on that though but
[4252.14 --> 4253.00]  again these I mean these
[4253.00 --> 4255.04]  are $300 IEMs yeah not
[4255.04 --> 4256.34]  everything has that feature
[4256.34 --> 4257.58]  that's an uncommon feature
[4257.58 --> 4258.70]  I know but I'm just saying
[4258.70 --> 4259.82]  like for the Sennheiser
[4259.82 --> 4260.36]  headphones that you're
[4260.36 --> 4261.14]  talking but these are
[4261.14 --> 4262.62]  solutions we shouldn't have
[4262.62 --> 4263.88]  to resort to completely
[4263.88 --> 4266.78]  agree okay well I'm just
[4266.78 --> 4267.96]  saying it might it might
[4267.96 --> 4270.08]  it might not be as bad I
[4270.08 --> 4271.38]  think instead of us playing
[4271.38 --> 4272.78]  devil's advocate because I'm
[4272.78 --> 4274.08]  obviously very upset right
[4274.08 --> 4275.92]  now we should have a moment
[4275.92 --> 4277.48]  of silence instead okay
[4277.48 --> 4289.08]  okay okay because I what I
[4289.08 --> 4290.46]  was really hoping for with
[4290.46 --> 4292.42]  this Beats acquisition was
[4292.42 --> 4294.12]  Beats headphones that
[4294.12 --> 4296.12]  looked good and sounded good
[4296.12 --> 4297.30]  and were built better yeah
[4297.30 --> 4298.48]  that's what I wanted out of
[4298.48 --> 4300.40]  this this is my worst
[4300.40 --> 4301.96]  nightmare yeah this is the
[4301.96 --> 4302.86]  worst thing that could have
[4302.86 --> 4303.84]  possibly come out of that
[4303.84 --> 4308.02]  acquisition well maybe not
[4308.02 --> 4309.10]  the worst maybe not the
[4309.10 --> 4310.72]  worst thing but it's it's
[4310.72 --> 4312.58]  very very very bad it's very
[4312.58 --> 4314.58]  terrible and stupid yeah and
[4314.58 --> 4315.76]  I need that to not happen
[4315.76 --> 4319.56]  yeah all right the
[4319.56 --> 4320.66]  specification could live
[4320.66 --> 4324.12]  anyway none of that's
[4324.12 --> 4325.48]  confirmed like Apple doing
[4325.48 --> 4326.36]  away with three and a half
[4326.36 --> 4327.10]  millimeter connectors
[4327.10 --> 4328.56]  entirely like these are all
[4328.56 --> 4329.88]  conclusions that were made
[4329.88 --> 4332.12]  up I mean there are ways that
[4332.12 --> 4334.02]  the tech could be cool for
[4334.02 --> 4335.04]  example if you had
[4335.04 --> 4336.84]  headphones some something
[4336.84 --> 4337.96]  that is easier to have a
[4337.96 --> 4339.92]  large battery in and every
[4339.92 --> 4340.50]  time you plugged your
[4340.50 --> 4341.54]  headphones into your iPhone
[4341.54 --> 4343.42]  it could charge them or
[4343.42 --> 4344.28]  something like that like
[4344.28 --> 4345.94]  there is room for this to be
[4345.94 --> 4347.52]  kind of cool as long as it
[4347.52 --> 4348.72]  doesn't get forced on us
[4348.72 --> 4351.46]  yeah so I will leave that
[4351.46 --> 4353.26]  positive possibility as the
[4353.26 --> 4354.28]  last thing that we say on the
[4354.28 --> 4359.06]  subject all right no Microsoft
[4359.06 --> 4361.42]  start menu on Windows 8 until
[4361.42 --> 4363.74]  2015 this was posted by NSF
[4363.74 --> 4369.66]  NS NFS underground and the
[4369.66 --> 4370.68]  original article is from
[4370.68 --> 4372.00]  maybe he's trying to recreate
[4372.00 --> 4374.44]  the sound of when your your
[4374.44 --> 4375.42]  engine is kind of tripping out
[4375.42 --> 4376.86]  when you're just revving when
[4376.86 --> 4377.64]  you're at the start of the line
[4377.64 --> 4380.02]  so it's need to speed
[4380.02 --> 4380.32]  underground
[4380.32 --> 4386.44]  okay so it's not coming in
[4386.44 --> 4388.28]  update 2 to Windows 8 point
[4388.28 --> 4390.46]  to Windows 8 it will be coming
[4390.46 --> 4392.60]  instead possibly with the next
[4392.60 --> 4395.48]  update to Windows 8 or Windows 9
[4395.48 --> 4396.72]  depending on how Microsoft
[4396.72 --> 4398.30]  decides to roll things out so
[4398.30 --> 4401.62]  this is their new mini modern UI
[4401.62 --> 4404.16]  start menu personally I don't
[4404.16 --> 4406.08]  really care because it'll likely be
[4406.08 --> 4408.22]  2015 by the time I roll a new
[4408.22 --> 4409.72]  operating system onto my system
[4409.72 --> 4414.16]  anyway yeah but great so I guess
[4414.16 --> 4416.72]  there's that our next topic is the
[4416.72 --> 4419.98]  Asus Sobranco Sobranco anyway
[4419.98 --> 4422.04]  whatever it's a it's a tough series
[4422.04 --> 4424.44]  motherboard with a white PCB now
[4424.44 --> 4429.40]  this is an opportunity for me to
[4429.40 --> 4431.48]  be oh they already got it oh that's a
[4431.48 --> 4432.98]  shame because I was looking forward
[4432.98 --> 4435.24]  to just going on an ego trip here this
[4435.24 --> 4440.06]  was originally posted by T Leet so I
[4440.06 --> 4441.88]  wanted to because Asus basically
[4441.88 --> 4443.84]  said look if you want to see more
[4443.84 --> 4446.02]  white PCB motherboards to match your
[4446.02 --> 4448.90]  sexy white PCB hardware we need 500
[4448.90 --> 4451.10]  retweets of this tweet and they were
[4451.10 --> 4453.00]  stuck at like 250 and I was like oh

[4566.58 --> 4569.04]  and I made my epeen grow at least three
[4569.04 --> 4572.04]  inches today so I appreciate that we
[4572.04 --> 4575.34]  have some good Microsoft news actually I
[4575.34 --> 4576.96]  have a prop for this one do you want to
[4576.96 --> 4578.22]  do you want to cover this in the meantime
[4578.22 --> 4580.30]  sure there's not much to say
[4580.30 --> 4583.02]  Microsoft announced that they were going
[4583.02 --> 4585.48]  to be whoa some cables got unplugged
[4585.48 --> 4592.26]  Microsoft announced that you should be
[4592.26 --> 4593.94]  able to use the Xbox one controller on your
[4593.94 --> 4596.58]  PC back in November and it's finally
[4596.58 --> 4598.62]  coming or is here already it's here now
[4598.62 --> 4599.94]  they're now available for download so
[4599.94 --> 4601.56]  yeah and you can connect it to your
[4601.56 --> 4603.42]  computer simply with micro USB cable so
[4603.42 --> 4605.10]  this is posted on the forum by
[4605.10 --> 4608.82]  denikiller37 although I do have to beat
[4608.82 --> 4610.62]  them up a little bit anyway the links are
[4610.62 --> 4612.90]  in the are in the thread there to where
[4612.90 --> 4615.60]  you can get the drivers for both x86 and x64
[4615.60 --> 4619.36]  versions of Windows but get this Microsoft is
[4619.36 --> 4621.04]  releasing the drivers today at its download
[4621.04 --> 4623.50]  site but the company is also planning to
[4623.50 --> 4625.12]  distribute them through Windows Update in
[4625.12 --> 4630.52]  the near future Microsoft what are you doing
[4630.52 --> 4633.10]  what do you mean why aren't they in Windows
[4633.10 --> 4636.04]  Update already oh yeah okay why you were
[4636.04 --> 4637.36]  against it being Windows Update I was like
[4637.36 --> 4640.54]  why not why is any piece of Microsoft
[4640.54 --> 4644.98]  hardware not in Windows Update yeah no I
[4644.98 --> 4646.68]  completely agree I thought I thought I thought
[4646.68 --> 4648.90]  you were against it and that's why I was
[4648.90 --> 4653.88]  why is anything not in Windows Update yeah
[4653.88 --> 4657.48]  if it's WICL certified why is it not in
[4657.48 --> 4659.94]  Windows Update why isn't that part of the
[4659.94 --> 4663.36]  procedure why do I have to dink around
[4663.36 --> 4666.00]  so have drivers still I totally thought
[4666.00 --> 4668.28]  you're on the other side of this and
[4668.28 --> 4670.44]  you're not at all and that's fantastic
[4670.44 --> 4673.50]  like Timmy if you're watching maybe you
[4673.50 --> 4675.72]  can give me an explanation that makes
[4675.72 --> 4680.70]  sense but I doubt it why are drivers not
[4680.70 --> 4682.62]  in Windows Update why do I have to think
[4682.62 --> 4684.94]  about this why is it easier to plug and
[4684.94 --> 4686.62]  play a Linux installation and have it
[4686.62 --> 4688.02]  automatically work with network drivers
[4688.02 --> 4690.00]  than it is a Windows one that should
[4690.00 --> 4693.30]  never be a thing ever never be a fail
[4693.30 --> 4694.90]  every laptop that I've ever tried to
[4694.90 --> 4698.08]  install Linux on perfect network that's
[4698.08 --> 4699.72]  all I need is network drivers because then I
[4699.72 --> 4701.64]  can move from there that's fine and then
[4701.64 --> 4702.92]  every single time that I've tried to
[4702.92 --> 4704.46]  install not every sometime but a lot of
[4704.46 --> 4706.32]  times I try to install Windows on a
[4706.32 --> 4707.78]  laptop especially if it's not the
[4707.78 --> 4710.14]  Windows that it came with horrible
[4710.14 --> 4712.18]  almost never get network drivers have to
[4712.18 --> 4714.26]  go hunt them down it's annoying and a lot
[4714.26 --> 4715.76]  of the time it's not even a matter of
[4715.76 --> 4718.60]  like oh derp it's not on Windows Update a
[4718.60 --> 4720.66]  lot of the time it's like oh okay I
[4720.66 --> 4722.78]  better go into device manager and like
[4722.78 --> 4726.00]  find the vendor ID and like PCI ID string
[4726.00 --> 4728.20]  and go Google that and find some post on
[4728.20 --> 4730.80]  like driver helper full of viruses well
[4730.80 --> 4733.66]  ah dot com yeah yeah why do I have to
[4733.66 --> 4735.42]  resort to that you know what while I'm
[4735.42 --> 4737.26]  bitching about this if anyone from
[4737.26 --> 4739.24]  adapt tech is watching you guys turn your
[4739.24 --> 4742.00]  download servers on after business hours
[4742.00 --> 4743.84]  from now on that's super stupid that's
[4743.84 --> 4745.44]  like the stupidest thing I've ever seen
[4745.44 --> 4747.78]  they turn their download servers for
[4747.78 --> 4750.64]  their drivers off outside of like business
[4750.64 --> 4754.88]  hours legit legitimately guys go check
[4754.88 --> 4758.04]  like I've been diagnosing like a raid card
[4758.04 --> 4759.38]  in the middle of the night because
[4759.38 --> 4761.40]  that's the only time when you diagnose
[4761.40 --> 4764.44]  you can take down your server yeah yeah
[4764.44 --> 4766.84]  and like their download servers just
[4766.84 --> 4768.36]  off honestly though a lot of server
[4768.36 --> 4770.16]  maintenance happens overnight so like it
[4770.16 --> 4772.86]  should it should be oh I'm so mad like
[4772.86 --> 4775.32]  so mad ridiculous people are like why is
[4775.32 --> 4777.74]  you mad today because things make me a lot
[4777.74 --> 4779.40]  of things to be mad about today speaking
[4779.40 --> 4780.80]  of things to be mad about this is
[4780.80 --> 4783.98]  actually both cool and terrifying yeah
[4783.98 --> 4785.96]  so gun company figures out how to shoot
[4785.96 --> 4787.54]  around corners using Google Glass so
[4787.54 --> 4788.98]  basically they've got a super advanced
[4788.98 --> 4792.14]  scope on this gun that allows you to use
[4792.14 --> 4794.26]  Google Glass as a site it also
[4794.26 --> 4797.08]  compensates for human error compensates
[4797.08 --> 4799.70]  for conditions it does all kinds of neat
[4799.70 --> 4802.30]  neat so keen stuff there's a short video
[4802.30 --> 4804.64]  it's about a minute long tracking point
[4804.64 --> 4807.88]  labs you know part of me is kind of like
[4807.88 --> 4813.02]  do we really really need more efficient
[4813.02 --> 4815.72]  ways to like put bullets in each other
[4815.72 --> 4818.00]  one thing that scares me is like all the
[4818.00 --> 4819.20]  stuff that's going on with NSA and stuff
[4819.20 --> 4820.86]  right now this is gonna very possibly
[4820.86 --> 4823.74]  create a big divide in between civilian
[4823.74 --> 4825.94]  uprising potential and government
[4825.94 --> 4828.50]  absolutely I mean it's already there you
[4828.50 --> 4830.02]  can already night vision goggles are
[4830.02 --> 4832.94]  already I know the end of guerrilla yeah you
[4832.94 --> 4834.44]  know that's actually something that I can't
[4834.44 --> 4835.80]  quite figure out why they weren't using
[4835.80 --> 4839.22]  thermal imaging to find that Moncton police
[4839.22 --> 4843.64]  killer yeah were they not it took them I
[4843.64 --> 4845.34]  didn't follow them over a full day to
[4845.34 --> 4846.74]  find him and he was just kind of hiding
[4846.74 --> 4848.94]  in the woods like I don't know maybe
[4848.94 --> 4850.56]  maybe it's possible that they're just not
[4850.56 --> 4852.20]  that sensitive yet but I just wouldn't
[4852.20 --> 4853.86]  they have military deployed on that they
[4853.86 --> 4856.10]  did have military deployed I mean they
[4856.10 --> 4857.60]  eventually did find him in the woods on
[4857.60 --> 4859.60]  armed they've apprehended him now okay do
[4859.60 --> 4860.90]  you know much about what happened not been
[4860.90 --> 4862.34]  following yeah I know I know he killed
[4862.34 --> 4863.56]  like I know that kind of stuff but I don't
[4863.56 --> 4866.06]  killed three officers and and wounded to
[4866.06 --> 4867.64]  others one knew about that seriously
[4867.64 --> 4870.34]  wounded yeah I just didn't know about
[4870.34 --> 4872.48]  them yeah I'm not gonna link to any news
[4872.48 --> 4874.46]  stories I'm not gonna name him because
[4874.46 --> 4876.18]  these people don't deserve any attention
[4876.18 --> 4880.00]  exactly yes dragon v2 speaking of people
[4880.00 --> 4882.70]  who do deserve attention super cool and
[4882.70 --> 4884.68]  freaking Elon Musk is just the coolest
[4884.68 --> 4887.56]  person on the planet so guys you should
[4887.56 --> 4889.22]  god you should check this out there's
[4889.22 --> 4891.46]  not there's not really too much for for
[4891.46 --> 4892.78]  us to say about it I'm gonna post there's
[4892.78 --> 4894.82]  the main I put the main points of the
[4894.82 --> 4897.46]  video in here is the the new capsule can
[4897.46 --> 4899.86]  hold seven astronauts it has propulsion
[4899.86 --> 4902.30]  based landing so it can land on a landing
[4902.30 --> 4903.92]  pad it can land pretty much anywhere but
[4903.92 --> 4905.18]  someone says you can't thermal through
[4905.18 --> 4907.42]  trees so there you go that's interesting
[4907.42 --> 4910.68]  you can land pretty much anywhere but more
[4910.68 --> 4912.06]  specifically on a landing pad you don't
[4912.06 --> 4914.66]  have to land in the ocean anymore and the
[4914.66 --> 4916.98]  heat shielding and stuff on the bottom is
[4916.98 --> 4919.20]  much more resistant and can be easily
[4919.20 --> 4921.74]  reused so if it can land on a landing
[4921.74 --> 4923.80]  pad and just have all the propellant
[4923.80 --> 4926.02]  refill hold hold very quickly sweet ice
[4926.02 --> 4931.36]  fox says Elon greater than Gabe n let's
[4931.36 --> 4933.52]  just let's just calm down okay everyone
[4933.52 --> 4937.52]  just needs to relax go ahead about Elon
[4937.52 --> 4938.74]  being greater than Gabe everyone just
[4938.74 --> 4942.44]  needs to relax they're in they're in
[4942.44 --> 4944.36]  completely it's like can you we told
[4944.36 --> 4946.22]  can we all just relax and stop being
[4946.22 --> 4950.36]  tense thank you we're looking we're
[4950.36 --> 4951.60]  looking at different castles here
[4951.60 --> 4953.98]  different castles I like that they're not
[4953.98 --> 4955.88]  they're both the king of their own
[4955.88 --> 4957.68]  castles all right sorry go ahead go ahead
[4957.68 --> 4959.30]  the rest of the points of boats um that
[4959.30 --> 4961.40]  was actually pretty much it is it can
[4961.40 --> 4963.90]  carry seven astronauts um it's very
[4963.90 --> 4966.30]  reusable definitely reusable and it can
[4966.30 --> 4969.00]  land pretty much anywhere very easily it
[4969.00 --> 4970.84]  uses propulsion based landing like I said
[4970.84 --> 4971.96]  so instead of having this crazy
[4971.96 --> 4973.52]  parachute like they did before where
[4973.52 --> 4974.78]  they just parachute out and then drift
[4974.78 --> 4977.52]  down into the water it it slows itself
[4977.52 --> 4979.78]  down as it's falling through I think it's
[4979.78 --> 4982.86]  I think it's four jets and then evens
[4982.86 --> 4984.62]  itself out and then lands with like these
[4984.62 --> 4986.70]  kind of spring-loaded not really spring-loaded
[4986.70 --> 4989.48]  but these feet that can compress not
[4989.48 --> 4991.54]  spring-loaded at all but feet that can
[4991.54 --> 4993.78]  compress so it just can it's actually very
[4993.78 --> 4996.62]  very cool all right we got a straw pole and
[4996.62 --> 4998.66]  the inside of this space shuttle is
[4998.66 --> 5005.04]  amazing have you seen it uh no okay you
[5005.04 --> 5006.88]  can talk about it though it's it's kind
[5006.88 --> 5008.52]  of hard to describe once you're done
[5008.52 --> 5010.18]  spamming there I can try to jump you
[5010.18 --> 5012.46]  forward in the video but essentially you
[5012.46 --> 5014.44]  you walk in it looks like super super
[5014.44 --> 5016.42]  clean and super futuristic unlike a lot
[5016.42 --> 5017.80]  of space shuttles that you see that look
[5017.80 --> 5020.88]  like mega ghetto and kind of disgusting and
[5020.88 --> 5022.72]  then he sits down in this baller looking
[5022.72 --> 5024.88]  chair and swings down this super badass
[5024.88 --> 5029.14]  monitor setup it's so cool yeah he's
[5029.14 --> 5030.56]  walking in so he's gonna get it he's
[5030.56 --> 5034.38]  gonna get in very soon guys so once he
[5034.38 --> 5037.90]  gets in there sweet so very nice seats
[5037.90 --> 5039.64]  again like he doesn't talk about them at
[5039.64 --> 5040.84]  all but like they actually look
[5040.84 --> 5042.34]  comfortable instead of the terrible
[5042.34 --> 5043.54]  things I've done before and then yeah
[5043.54 --> 5045.42]  okay go a little bit back because you
[5045.42 --> 5046.76]  got to see him swing down the monitor
[5046.76 --> 5048.64]  setup you can see it's up right now
[5048.64 --> 5054.28]  he'll pull it down so badass swoop
[5054.28 --> 5057.30]  and then if you can actually see the
[5057.30 --> 5060.58]  control panels like it actually looks
[5060.58 --> 5062.26]  like futuristic and badass I know that
[5062.26 --> 5064.42]  doesn't really matter but like it looks
[5064.42 --> 5067.52]  really cool they there you can see all
[5067.52 --> 5069.70]  their monitoring panels and like all the
[5069.70 --> 5071.58]  stuff in the middle he's got spaceship
[5071.58 --> 5073.50]  control is that like joysticky thing kind
[5073.50 --> 5074.96]  of in the middle and then most of those
[5074.96 --> 5077.04]  manual buttons are all emergency things
[5077.04 --> 5079.16]  so you don't have to use the other
[5079.16 --> 5080.34]  displays and stuff they're all emergency
[5080.34 --> 5082.84]  stuff and yeah I don't know I thought
[5082.84 --> 5089.02]  this was super cool yeah I was watching
[5089.02 --> 5090.22]  it and then I ran out of time I actually
[5090.22 --> 5091.32]  didn't make it to the end I didn't know
[5091.32 --> 5093.40]  he went inside yeah that is awesome
[5093.40 --> 5095.30]  it's pretty freaking cool how's that
[5095.30 --> 5097.14]  straw pool doing all right let's check
[5097.14 --> 5102.06]  out that straw pool castles okay castles
[5102.06 --> 5109.44]  castles so we've got 42% of the votes going
[5109.44 --> 5112.38]  to Gabe in 41% of the votes going to
[5112.38 --> 5115.98]  castles and 17% going to Elon Musk although
[5115.98 --> 5117.84]  I don't think there's really any denying
[5117.84 --> 5121.58]  that Elon's or mr. Musk's contributions to
[5121.58 --> 5124.50]  humanity as a whole are probably more more
[5124.50 --> 5127.32]  impactful than Gabe ends but then how is
[5127.32 --> 5129.06]  that that's very difficult to quantify because
[5129.06 --> 5132.02]  it's true but because Gabe in could inspire
[5132.02 --> 5135.06]  more people if it's not in the same way it's
[5135.82 --> 5137.98]  it's not necessarily lower and Gabe ended
[5137.98 --> 5140.20]  more than just gaming yeah digital digital
[5140.20 --> 5142.44]  content distribution and he was a pioneer
[5142.44 --> 5144.34]  yeah and he's pushed forward for those like
[5144.34 --> 5147.50]  racing that racing thing I don't know
[5147.50 --> 5151.36]  anyway yeah it's not really uh I I vote for
[5151.36 --> 5153.54]  castles you vote for castles you go vote for
[5153.54 --> 5157.08]  castles then one vote doesn't matter loser it
[5157.08 --> 5159.88]  does actually every vote counts yeah yeah
[5159.88 --> 5162.20]  I'm gonna go find it and vote just because
[5162.20 --> 5163.90]  you said that that's fine
[5163.90 --> 5165.44]  it's gonna take me a sec to find it
[5165.44 --> 5168.80]  I don't know where it is I give up
[5168.80 --> 5171.90]  you can find things to vote for on your own
[5171.90 --> 5174.62]  time yeah pretty much all right more
[5174.62 --> 5177.48]  thingy-majiggers um yeah I fired up the
[5177.48 --> 5182.12]  star citizen uh what's up oh yeah right we
[5182.12 --> 5183.82]  actually have something really cool for you

[5195.44 --> 5197.32]  what you would like to see a mass drop
[5197.32 --> 5199.94]  deal on we are working with mass drop to
[5199.94 --> 5202.54]  basically find one thing that our
[5202.54 --> 5205.58]  community really wants to see and bring
[5205.58 --> 5209.32]  it to you guys that's it it's simple so
[5209.32 --> 5211.46]  everyone take just a minute of your time
[5211.46 --> 5212.90]  think of something that you think is
[5212.90 --> 5214.58]  really cool hopefully you know
[5214.58 --> 5216.38]  electronics or computer stuff or
[5216.38 --> 5219.62]  something um and then just use hashtag
[5219.62 --> 5223.40]  Linus mass drop and tweet that out and
[5223.40 --> 5226.22]  we will have someone preferably a lackey
[5226.22 --> 5228.26]  and not me go through them all and
[5228.26 --> 5230.38]  compile a list of the most popular ones
[5230.38 --> 5232.10]  and then we're gonna pick one from there
[5232.10 --> 5233.68]  that we think is really cool and we think
[5233.68 --> 5235.54]  would be a great mass drop item and we
[5235.54 --> 5237.44]  are going to be bringing that to you guys
[5237.44 --> 5239.84]  through the mass drop team so be excited
[5239.84 --> 5241.34]  about that because it's gonna be really
[5241.34 --> 5243.20]  really sweet awesome now what were you
[5243.20 --> 5244.82]  saying about Star Citizen I was saying I
[5244.82 --> 5246.52]  tried it and the mouse controls are
[5246.52 --> 5248.36]  balls so I need to get a joystick I'm
[5248.36 --> 5250.88]  actually going to order a USB to game
[5250.88 --> 5252.92]  controller adapter so I can use my old
[5252.92 --> 5255.14]  Top Gun joystick but I also have a
[5255.14 --> 5256.82]  scitec aviator that I can use in the
[5256.82 --> 5258.80]  meantime it just doesn't have that same
[5258.80 --> 5261.38]  no it doesn't quality feel to it though
[5261.38 --> 5264.56]  I don't really like it so there you go oh
[5264.56 --> 5266.90]  well solar freaking roadways we're not
[5266.90 --> 5268.90]  doing a mass drop for solar roadways
[5268.90 --> 5270.88]  especially because they don't work
[5270.88 --> 5278.12]  sorry to spoil that one very cool
[5278.12 --> 5280.88]  concept though yeah I give it give it a
[5280.88 --> 5283.22]  little while longer a lot of while long
[5283.22 --> 5284.84]  and we'll find a way to leverage my
[5284.84 --> 5288.14]  conclusion a little better someone says
[5288.14 --> 5291.08]  butt plugs I don't think we should ask
[5291.08 --> 5293.96]  for butt plugs you can get windows for 50
[5293.96 --> 5298.16]  cents on oh PC it's ludicrous ROG Jay-Z
