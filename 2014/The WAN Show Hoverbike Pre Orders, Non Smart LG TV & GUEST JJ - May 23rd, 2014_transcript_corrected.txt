[0.00 → 5.00] The mic's in kind of random position, but you know what?
[5.00 → 11.44] Whatever. Guys, you know the funny thing about technical difficulties is that
[11.44 → 14.64] sometimes you're looking for these complicated solutions because we've had
[14.64 → 20.56] so many problems on this show in the past with like capture cards being like
[20.56 → 25.44] the wrong settings and like you know like here, here just like funny stupid
[25.44 → 30.48] stuff like this where outputting over HDMI from a laptop by the way you know
[30.48 → 35.36] big thanks to Asus G750JZ, sponsor the laptop of the show all that good
[35.36 → 41.00] stuff so you output over a laptop over HDMI which in theory is a 1080p 60
[41.00 → 47.60] Hertz signal but on our capture card you don't set a progressive input you set
[47.60 → 57.36] 59.97 interlaced. It's just like stuff that unless you're some kind of savant
[57.36 → 61.84] you can't possibly be expected to know, and so we've done enough trial and error
[61.84 → 66.64] with this stuff that when something doesn't work, and I go oh no my laptop
[66.64 → 71.84] capture is not working okay let's try all the Hertz and try all the like I'm gonna
[71.84 → 78.32] I'm going to grab like my cables and like yeah yeah yeah grab like you know
[78.32 → 82.92] half a dozen different laptops and like the weird like adapters that you made by
[82.92 → 87.92] putting together multiple adapters, and then it turns out someone stepped on the
[87.92 → 92.40] blanking cable and pulled it out of the capture card over on the other end which
[92.40 → 98.08] I can't see so that is why we're late I am terribly sorry guys you deserve the
[98.08 → 103.68] very best from us and uh we we were late today we are trying to we're
[103.68 → 109.20] trying to be better about all that stuff, but we are human or are we nope
[109.20 → 111.12] spoiler alert
[111.12 → 119.20] and it was revealed later on in the show that actually they were livestock
[119.20 → 126.48] I was going to do a sheep now I don't know what to do you could go with cow I don't
[126.48 → 130.88] want to go with cow just because you've been losing weight lately doesn't mean that
[130.88 → 139.12] you don't have to make the counter make the cow noise no they get no speaking of
[139.12 → 145.16] speaking of paying people to do things and basically owning their souls you guys we
[145.16 → 152.60] did the most unusual sponsor integration ever for fractal design on fast as
[152.60 → 156.36] possible that video will be up tonight as long as Taken finishes editing it before
[156.36 → 161.00] he has to go to a wedding over there and let me tell you guys it is something a
[161.00 → 168.36] little bit different and yes indeed thank you twitch chat cheap is only a word
[168.36 → 173.96] nothing more than that in fact if we break it down even further sheep is nothing but
[173.96 → 178.92] five letters series of characters all right and when show is just a
[178.92 → 183.80] series of topics that are technology and gaming and all that great stuff so we've
[183.80 → 190.36] got a few interesting things this week number one is hover bikes are evidently an
[190.36 → 196.68] actual thing there is a hover bike it is going into production you can pre-order one
[196.68 → 204.36] blah also the infinite could be a more elegant omnidirectional treadmill solution compared to the
[204.36 → 209.72] virtual omni which we have checked out, but there are going to be some challenges so we'll talk to
[209.72 → 216.12] you guys more about that after um l oh I'll let you talk it's all good either way LG is going to be
[216.12 → 221.32] well they already did update their privacy policy so that essentially you have to share everything or
[221.32 → 227.24] get nothing we'll talk more about that later and bungee has done the hero move and saved halo combat
[227.24 → 232.60] evolved and custom edition, and we'll talk about that later they are so cool yeah I pretty much love
[232.60 → 235.48] them I want their boots just so that I can lick them
[238.60 → 249.32] so you don't necessarily have to be in the boots no, no okay
[251.32 → 281.08] there we go the show today uh okay put the things in the right places

[307.08 → 309.02] and this one is one you guys are probably
[309.02 → 311.02] going to get pretty amped up about.
[311.78 → 314.06] Geek stakes 2014 is on,
[314.16 → 315.72] and the sponsor is Modes,

[338.20 → 338.76] Dun-dun-dun!
[338.88 → 339.60] More on that later.
[339.60 → 340.80] And finally,
[341.20 → 341.96] yes,
[342.16 → 346.58] the G750JZ DOG Notebook,
[346.98 → 350.66] and brought to you by JJ today,
[351.36 → 352.42] and also,
[352.80 → 355.68] my water bottle today is brought to you by JJ,
[355.68 → 360.48] and all of our topics today are brought to you by JJ and ASUS.
[360.54 → 364.46] We're going to be talking Z97 with the one and only JJ from ASUS,
[364.64 → 369.40] and huge thanks to ASUS for providing us with these G750JZs
[369.40 → 371.52] that we use for the WAN show here.
[371.52 → 375.60] I was almost in a bit of an awkward position where I was like,
[375.86 → 379.60] maybe it's the laptop's fault that I can't output and screen share,
[379.94 → 384.66] and I was like, oh, that's going to be like really, really awkward if I have to say that,
[384.66 → 386.18] but it wasn't.
[386.34 → 387.54] So now...
[387.54 → 388.50] Yay! No awkwardness.
[388.58 → 394.54] I get to talk about the rock-solid heart-touching reliability of the HDMI output on this notebook,
[394.54 → 398.42] and I don't have to stress out about that other stuff.
[398.42 → 398.92] I'm sorry?
[399.00 → 399.66] Did it touch your heart?
[399.66 → 400.80] Oh, it definitely touched me.
[400.82 → 401.40] Were you emotionally happy?
[401.72 → 402.60] I don't know about the heart.
[402.90 → 404.24] It does kind of touch you, actually.
[404.34 → 405.14] It does touch me.
[405.16 → 405.60] Quite intimately.
[405.78 → 407.82] And it touches my junk.
[408.06 → 408.28] Yep.
[408.70 → 409.52] It touches my junk.
[409.96 → 411.28] And I'm okay with that,
[411.38 → 412.90] because it actually doesn't run that hot.
[413.24 → 414.58] Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[414.58 → 415.78] For a gaming notebook,
[416.02 → 418.08] I'm surprisingly okay with...
[418.08 → 420.04] It's just like a nice, comfortable warmth.
[420.52 → 420.78] Yeah.
[422.26 → 425.64] Having warm junk is not a bad thing.
[425.88 → 428.58] So we both comfortably spoon...
[428.58 → 429.62] Our notebooks.
[429.64 → 430.18] Our notebooks.
[430.28 → 430.42] Yeah.
[431.10 → 433.14] Well, no, for us to call it spooning,
[433.28 → 434.92] we'd have to, like, kind of turn them around.
[435.16 → 436.80] That's going to be really bad for usability.
[436.92 → 437.78] Sit like this with them.
[437.86 → 438.80] Yeah, but they're...
[438.80 → 439.32] You know what?
[439.36 → 442.36] If I had a criticism of Asus' latest gaming notebook...
[442.36 → 444.58] The reach-around is not very easy.
[444.90 → 446.08] The reach-around doesn't work.
[448.56 → 450.18] Reach-around is very difficult to manage.
[450.86 → 453.18] You need to make it so that the keyboard can pop out
[453.18 → 454.44] and then swivel around.
[454.84 → 455.42] Yeah, well...
[455.42 → 456.16] So you can type backwards.
[456.24 → 457.34] The funny thing about Asus is
[457.34 → 458.58] they have so many different notebooks
[458.58 → 460.54] that they, like, probably have one like that.
[461.14 → 461.60] Like a...
[461.60 → 461.78] Really?
[463.00 → 463.88] The Tai Chi.
[464.18 → 465.78] It's got screens on both sides.
[467.76 → 468.16] Yes.
[468.88 → 469.24] Perfect.
[469.52 → 469.84] Okay.
[470.02 → 470.58] There we go.
[470.66 → 471.66] Oh, I love it.
[472.62 → 474.60] What the hell are we even talking about?
[474.66 → 474.98] I don't know.
[475.08 → 475.68] Spooning laptops?
[475.94 → 476.66] Spooning laptops.
[476.66 → 478.40] No, we have an actual show...
[478.40 → 480.54] Can you just stay focused for five minutes?
[480.54 → 482.26] I guess.
[482.40 → 483.58] I mean, like...
[483.58 → 484.44] Jeez, man.
[484.94 → 486.96] Twitch chat is not working for me.
[487.04 → 489.40] So unfortunately, I can't chat with you guys.
[489.50 → 492.02] Maybe it's because I got signed out for some reason.
[492.60 → 495.38] I'm just going to go ahead and sign that baby back in.
[495.60 → 498.96] And then let's kick off our first topic here, you guys.
[498.96 → 500.92] Our first topic, I believe, is hover bikes.
[501.20 → 501.82] Hover bikes.
[501.88 → 502.78] Let's do that.
[502.86 → 503.14] Okay.
[503.24 → 504.92] So you guys, check this out.
[505.02 → 506.48] This is unreal.
[506.98 → 509.20] We're going to screen share because we can do that.
[509.28 → 510.28] Apparently there's an advertisement.
[510.64 → 510.98] Oh.
[511.38 → 511.92] No way.
[512.08 → 514.50] Long summer weekends are just around the corner.
[514.60 → 515.82] Oh, they have audio.
[516.18 → 516.52] Oh, no.
[516.52 → 516.92] It's Twitch.
[516.92 → 517.14] Oh, no.
[517.14 → 517.64] It's Twitch.
[517.64 → 517.84] Yeah.
[517.84 → 518.60] It's your certified service expert.
[518.94 → 519.16] No.
[519.64 → 520.24] Yeah, it is.
[520.32 → 520.68] It's Twitch.
[521.10 → 524.24] It's that hardcore muted but still doing things.
[524.72 → 525.82] We could learn about these.
[525.92 → 527.54] Oh, the ad goes away on its own.
[528.12 → 528.94] That's innovative.
[529.12 → 529.56] Beautiful.
[529.90 → 530.94] So there it is, you guys.
[530.94 → 531.82] No skip button here.
[531.82 → 538.04] The world's first functional hover bike, the Aero X.
[538.20 → 543.54] And this is such a great, this is such a great, this is such a great tagline.
[543.54 → 550.86] The Aero X lets you pretend to hover bike through the forests of Vendor, which it legit actually does.
[550.94 → 553.12] So this picture is not faked in any way.
[553.42 → 556.44] This isn't like the hover skateboard hoax.
[556.44 → 556.46] No.
[556.70 → 557.72] That was so depressing.
[557.72 → 562.38] With, you know, Christopher Lloyd and Tony Hawk and like all these people involved.
[562.50 → 564.94] And I was just like, what are you guys actually doing?
[565.14 → 567.92] And it was like right before but not on April Fool's.
[568.02 → 568.38] Yeah.
[568.60 → 570.48] Like it wasn't April Fool's.
[570.48 → 576.02] I was just like, yeah, this is just kind of mean to people because a lot of people really went for it.
[576.52 → 578.34] So I was sad for them.
[578.34 → 586.34] So basically this, the video here is actually from a prototype back in 2012.
[587.68 → 589.52] And I don't know if we've got audio here.
[589.56 → 593.44] I don't know if there's actually audio on this, on this video here.
[593.48 → 594.68] I'm just going to check really quick here.
[594.68 → 595.90] Yeah, okay.
[595.94 → 596.86] There's no audio on the video.
[597.22 → 599.44] But some of the interesting stuff actually happens a little bit later.
[599.52 → 607.82] So some of the challenges that they went through were figuring out how to counter the like when you're first spinning up the rotors,
[607.98 → 614.06] there's a lot of force that can cause it to, that can cause the bike to torque one way or the other.
[614.06 → 615.92] They had to figure out how to counter that.
[616.02 → 625.56] They had to take some cues from quadcopters like the Varadkar drone with respect to how to track if you're just drifting in the wind.
[625.94 → 629.94] The idea though, and this is, this is the craziest thing about it.
[630.00 → 638.04] The idea here is that if you ride a motorcycle, you should be able to straight up get on one of these and ride it.
[638.04 → 644.62] Which as someone who can ride a motorcycle is like pretty exciting.
[645.10 → 645.22] Yeah.
[645.48 → 649.08] So they're going pretty slow in this video, but this is quite an old video.
[649.38 → 651.02] Oh yeah, I saw this like years ago.
[651.04 → 651.84] Oh man, look at this.
[652.06 → 656.26] But what's cool about it is they're giving us some specs about the finished one.
[656.26 → 665.22] So they're saying it can go up to 67 kilometres an hour and up to 3.7 meters high, which doesn't sound like a ton.
[666.16 → 667.58] 72 kilometres an hour, sorry.
[667.58 → 674.50] And up to 3.7 meters high, which doesn't sound that high, but think about this for a second, especially the American viewers.
[677.28 → 680.54] 3.7 meters is more than a story.
[681.58 → 687.70] Like that's more than the height of like almost pretty much the highest ceiling you'd ever find in a house.
[687.70 → 697.06] So you would, you could literally be driving around looking into second story windows if something like this was ever street legal.
[697.06 → 699.02] Which you probably shouldn't do.
[699.14 → 700.02] Yeah, and you probably shouldn't do that.
[700.34 → 707.28] And the reason for the 3.7 meter height restriction is actually so that you don't get classified as an aircraft.
[707.28 → 712.46] In theory, I guess there's no real reason why it couldn't go higher.
[713.26 → 714.20] But like...
[714.20 → 715.12] I know.
[715.12 → 716.12] I know.
[716.12 → 717.12] Like that override ship.
[717.12 → 718.12] I know.
[718.12 → 719.12] It's going to be brutal.
[719.12 → 725.50] Someone will die, and then they're going to set back personal flying vehicles like 10, 20 years.
[725.50 → 726.58] Yeah, it's going to be terrible.
[726.58 → 728.16] You are wrecking it for us all.
[728.16 → 730.42] They have safety stuff too, which I thought was interesting.
[730.54 → 734.12] Those like anti-flip guide rails that you saw around the side in the video.
[734.60 → 739.68] And they're thinking about doing stuff like replacing those or adding on airbags, which I think is really smart.
[740.32 → 746.04] That's actually either really smart or like just a totally bad idea.
[746.16 → 747.90] Like how do you put an airbag on a motorcycle?
[748.08 → 751.30] I think it's designed more like that motorcycle helmet that's an airbag.
[751.44 → 753.88] Sorry, not motorcycle helmet, but like pedal biking helmet.
[754.02 → 754.62] Yeah, okay.
[754.62 → 757.66] Because it'll register a fall and then...
[757.66 → 760.04] And I think it's going to be around the sides.
[760.24 → 762.10] So it could be more like a suit almost even.
[762.80 → 763.34] Or a suit.
[763.34 → 768.16] Like I'm in free fall, and it goes like Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters on me.
[769.40 → 771.20] And it's like lets itself pop.
[771.60 → 775.34] So you have the soft impact and then maybe you fall like a foot, but it's no big deal.
[775.48 → 777.60] I don't think you'd want it to let itself pop.
[777.60 → 783.78] Because the thing about crumple zones on cars is that they're designed to be weak, but strong enough.
[784.18 → 785.16] Because like let's say...
[785.16 → 786.82] Okay, so let's think about...
[786.82 → 787.80] But it's not going to...
[787.80 → 789.88] Unless they make it foam.
[790.36 → 792.04] If it's an airbag, it's not going to crumple zone.
[792.34 → 792.88] Yeah, exactly.
[793.30 → 796.60] So like if it popped, that's like kind of like crumple zone logic.
[796.96 → 798.10] Yeah, that's why I was thinking.
[798.18 → 799.50] Yeah, so that's like probably terrible.
[799.50 → 800.50] Because like...
[800.50 → 802.34] Okay, depending on how you're falling, right?
[802.48 → 802.68] Yeah.
[802.68 → 808.54] Because if the way that you crash is kind of like, you know, the one Stormtrooper or bike trooper or whatever they were called.
[808.60 → 809.48] You know why they had those?
[810.48 → 814.94] Because there was an issue manufacturing like Stormtrooper armour.
[815.38 → 817.96] And so they're like, oh yeah, we'll like to redesign them.
[818.02 → 819.96] We'll call them like these troopers.
[820.52 → 822.28] This is all hearsay.
[822.42 → 824.38] It's not validated, but that's a rumour I heard.
[824.38 → 829.16] So anyway, like the one guy who gets thrown off the bike and goes into the tree.
[829.90 → 834.42] And like what I think was one of the most memorable Star Wars bad guy deaths, actually.
[834.84 → 837.72] The guy who like hits the tree upside down and then falls down.
[838.10 → 845.32] So if that was how you like to fell off of it, like something disastrous happened, you went flying off of it at 72 kilometres an hour.
[845.32 → 848.60] Or you would want it to be solid enough.
[849.54 → 850.80] Yeah, my only...
[850.80 → 852.14] To bounce more than like...
[852.14 → 854.84] That's what I was worried about though, is exactly what you just said, is bouncing.
[855.50 → 856.42] Because I don't want to bounce.
[856.64 → 858.46] I feel like that would be a terrible thing.
[858.82 → 862.26] And you're just smacking something at 72 kilometres an hour and then going...
[862.26 → 872.34] One way that you could absorb the impact without letting the air out of the device is you could allow the air to shift around inside the bubble.
[872.34 → 874.34] So not like fully inflated?
[874.34 → 875.60] Yeah, so like...
[875.60 → 877.20] Like a little bit of relaxation?
[877.20 → 878.62] Yeah, or if you had like...
[878.62 → 887.42] Or if you had, you know, narrower gaps internally so that the air can't move extremely quickly from one zone to another.
[887.54 → 889.30] Or just like squeeze into another zone but not flow?
[889.44 → 893.94] Yeah, then you could keep it from just bouncing off of trees or whatever else.
[893.94 → 894.70] Neither of us are engineers.
[894.78 → 895.14] Yeah, neither of us are...
[895.14 → 896.52] This seems like a not terrible idea.
[896.70 → 898.84] Safety, you know, rangers.
[898.84 → 901.84] I thought that was super cool when they came out with a biking helmet that inflates.
[901.84 → 904.60] It was just way too expensive, if I remember correctly.
[904.88 → 906.02] Yeah, it was.
[906.40 → 907.52] Yeah, it was really expensive.
[907.52 → 907.96] It was crazy expensive.
[908.26 → 910.58] And I don't even know that it was available in North America.
[911.02 → 911.72] So that's...
[911.72 → 912.48] I don't really think so.
[912.56 → 914.34] It was just like a university project.
[914.44 → 916.26] Someone says that's not how airbags work, Tennis.
[916.40 → 917.98] I know that's not how airbags work.
[918.16 → 919.38] We're not talking about airbags.
[919.38 → 921.76] And again, we're not safety engineers.
[922.26 → 925.76] So like, don't listen to any of that because none of that will happen.
[926.28 → 928.86] We would be safety engineers.
[929.74 → 933.36] I think what they were talking about anyway was airbags on the side of the thing.
[933.66 → 936.12] I like this idea from Felix R90.
[936.12 → 939.08] A giant laser beam that destroys everything in front of you.
[939.44 → 939.54] Perfect.
[939.64 → 940.40] So you don't hit it.
[940.40 → 941.72] And you never have to worry about it.
[941.72 → 942.68] Well, because you know what?
[942.84 → 948.86] That's why motorcyclists on the track can crash at a couple of hundred kilometres an hour
[948.86 → 954.18] and actually be much less likely to be injured or killed than someone who crashes on the street
[954.18 → 958.18] going 70, 80 kilometres an hour because there are no obstacles.
[958.54 → 960.80] I thought you were going to say because they're giant laser beams.
[960.92 → 961.58] And I was like, what?
[962.36 → 962.70] No.
[963.04 → 965.10] It's like, yeah, the Ducati laser beam-o-bio.
[966.34 → 969.64] No, because what happens is if you watch what happens when a motorcyclist crashes,
[969.70 → 970.56] like it's still bad.
[970.56 → 973.98] And you can still get, like, messed up real good.
[974.18 → 975.58] But they skid on their gear.
[975.80 → 976.96] They slide on the gear.
[977.14 → 978.56] Whereas when you hit a lamppost...
[979.28 → 979.86] It's horrible.
[980.00 → 981.32] Your slide stops.
[981.66 → 983.06] Yeah, I saw this GIF.
[983.30 → 983.98] Terrible segue.
[984.16 → 986.52] But I saw this GIF of guys skateboarding.
[986.58 → 989.38] And the one guy flies off, and his skateboard goes across and takes out a few people.
[989.88 → 993.24] One of the guys jumps off his skateboard before he gets hit by the other skateboard.
[993.66 → 994.88] And they're going really fast.
[995.00 → 997.06] So he has to, like, keep himself running, but he's going too quick.
[997.12 → 1000.10] And he dives, and he skims right beside this pole.
[1000.10 → 1003.08] And he slides, like, really fast right beside it.
[1003.12 → 1005.58] And if you had nailed right into it, that would have been terrible.
[1006.04 → 1006.68] Did you see the...
[1006.68 → 1008.22] It's like, oh, God.
[1008.28 → 1012.92] Did you see the one of the skateboarder who lands on his ass at the bottom of a bike rail?
[1013.12 → 1015.10] And then, like, lands right on the skateboard?
[1015.38 → 1015.72] Yeah.
[1015.98 → 1019.16] And then just, like, rolls on by and the guy gives him a high five?
[1021.02 → 1022.00] Oh, that was awesome.
[1022.14 → 1023.98] We should just turn this whole show into meme.
[1024.16 → 1024.58] I know.
[1024.74 → 1025.38] We should just...
[1025.38 → 1026.44] Cover all the memes.
[1026.44 → 1028.92] Ray William Johnson's not doing Equals 3 anymore.
[1029.50 → 1031.52] I think that there is a definite gap.
[1032.10 → 1032.36] Okay.
[1032.46 → 1032.96] Sorry, guys.
[1033.00 → 1035.30] It's not April Fool's, so I shouldn't be making jokes like that.
[1035.36 → 1038.02] We are not turning this into Equals 3.
[1038.12 → 1038.26] No.
[1038.94 → 1040.28] Equals when.
[1041.74 → 1043.48] We're rebranding the show again.
[1043.96 → 1045.72] And you guys will all hate it again.
[1045.86 → 1046.02] Okay.
[1046.02 → 1050.02] Let's do one more topic before we bring JJ on, just because otherwise I feel like we're
[1050.02 → 1052.02] not going to get any topics done today.
[1052.24 → 1052.50] Infinite?
[1053.04 → 1053.44] Yeah.
[1053.86 → 1054.72] The Infinite.
[1054.88 → 1055.76] This, you guys.
[1056.12 → 1060.70] This is actually...
[1060.70 → 1061.72] You know what?
[1061.78 → 1063.48] I'll let you introduce this topic.
[1063.76 → 1067.20] I'm going to fire up the video here, though, so that they can check this out while you talk.
[1067.20 → 1073.84] So, Omni was called a 360 degree treadmill, essentially, but it wasn't really...
[1073.84 → 1077.12] It depends on, I guess, how you want to look at that, but I don't really see it as a treadmill
[1077.12 → 1081.00] because you just kind of slid with shoes that were designed for sliding.
[1081.08 → 1085.02] It's more like a tread cereal bowl that you stand in.
[1085.12 → 1085.26] Yeah.
[1085.42 → 1089.76] This is actually a treadmill that can actually go in 360 degrees, which is very interesting.
[1089.88 → 1094.20] You can see they're walking on crazy angles, but that's because the treads are moving in
[1094.20 → 1096.38] two different directions, which allow that to be able to happen.
[1096.92 → 1098.42] So, very interesting.
[1098.52 → 1102.46] It still has tons of the same problems that Omni has, and probably even more so in the
[1102.46 → 1108.30] idea of it not being very easy to store, being gigantic in general.
[1108.46 → 1109.10] Being expensive.
[1109.20 → 1109.94] Being expensive.
[1110.26 → 1111.24] Difficult to manufacture.
[1111.44 → 1113.00] Difficult to manufacture, all that kind of stuff.
[1113.62 → 1115.42] Probably even more so for most of those.
[1115.58 → 1120.00] It has tons of other issues, too, in terms of latency, getting feedback from the game,
[1120.40 → 1123.96] and it's not reacting in time, you're moving in a weird way and it's not reacting in time.
[1124.20 → 1125.14] All this kind of stuff.
[1125.24 → 1130.50] That being said, it's really early on, so hopefully that kind of stuff can come later.
[1132.70 → 1133.10] It's...
[1133.10 → 1135.26] Yeah, it's going to be expensive.
[1135.52 → 1136.54] I can't see this possibly...
[1136.54 → 1139.10] Because you've got to think, it's more advanced than a normal treadmill.
[1139.68 → 1139.92] Yeah.
[1140.12 → 1141.92] And treadmills are already not that cheap.
[1141.92 → 1147.36] But then again, exercise equipment seems to be the biggest gigantic scam in the entire
[1147.36 → 1151.44] world, in terms of how much that stuff costs versus how much it costs to manufacture.
[1151.44 → 1153.42] I mean, it's a weight.
[1154.30 → 1156.74] It's literally a hunk of metal.
[1156.90 → 1159.44] The dumbbells that I have at my house are like, just...
[1160.38 → 1161.78] It's one solid piece.
[1161.86 → 1163.16] Like, it's not one of those really nice ones.
[1163.26 → 1167.24] And even the paint on it is like, it obviously dripped on the one side, and they all look like
[1167.24 → 1167.52] that.
[1167.76 → 1170.32] They're like, not even that cheap, and they're just completely crap.
[1170.44 → 1172.00] But it's just the cheapest ones that they had.
[1172.58 → 1173.20] So I was like, whatever.
[1173.30 → 1174.32] I don't need a fancy one.
[1174.50 → 1177.08] It weighs a certain amount and I pick it up and put it down.
[1177.08 → 1180.20] So I'm not too worried about it.
[1180.38 → 1181.18] Like, the biggest scam ever.
[1181.34 → 1184.76] You know, that would be a great business idea.
[1185.60 → 1186.80] Linus Media Group weights?
[1187.04 → 1187.76] No, no.
[1187.90 → 1188.80] I don't want to do it.
[1189.00 → 1194.94] But if someone went, okay, we're going to make environmentally conscious exercise equipment.
[1194.94 → 1199.42] So basically all it is, is like recycled metal and crap.
[1199.76 → 1204.54] And they just mould it into the shape of things that people can lift and put down.
[1204.66 → 1208.66] And they'll just be like, look, this stuff legit didn't cost us any more than scrap metal costs.
[1208.84 → 1214.26] So you cover the shipping, you cover our cost to turn it into this shape, and we're good.
[1214.94 → 1216.26] And also some profit.
[1216.76 → 1218.14] But not as much.
[1218.26 → 1219.66] But not that much.
[1219.72 → 1220.72] Yeah, not that much.
[1221.22 → 1222.58] That's not a bad idea.
[1222.58 → 1224.46] I'm sure that would work pretty well, actually.
[1224.94 → 1227.68] It's not the world's most horrible idea.
[1229.56 → 1231.04] By Linus Media Group.
[1231.62 → 1235.18] Oh, we never said the hover bike.
[1235.40 → 1235.80] Right.
[1235.90 → 1239.80] You have to put down $5,000, and the price is going to be $85,000.
[1239.90 → 1245.38] So you put down $5,000 just to reserve one, and they're not expecting them to actually be available until 2017.
[1245.38 → 1250.20] So this is like some pretty hardcore pre-ordering going on.
[1250.20 → 1259.56] But expecting clients like U.S. Border Patrol or Park Rangers, or they're an off-road vehicle, to be the target for this.
[1260.26 → 1261.28] Maybe they're willing.
[1261.50 → 1266.02] Maybe some of them are willing to at least invest in one to find out if it's a good idea and then go from there.
[1266.02 → 1268.02] Apparently someone has named them slick lifts.
[1268.26 → 1268.94] Slick lifts.
[1269.50 → 1273.98] I think slick lifts are more like the kind of thing I would want to wear in my shoes.
[1274.74 → 1274.98] Oh.
[1276.30 → 1277.18] That's not a bad name.
[1277.20 → 1277.80] Slick lifts.
[1278.40 → 1279.62] And they could be like stylish.
[1280.06 → 1281.40] They could be like fancy colours.
[1281.40 → 1290.84] Because if we've learned anything from Kickstarter, it's that people will kickstart the hell out of anything that's a completely normal thing, but like different colours.
[1290.92 → 1295.16] Did you see that Kickstarter for brightly coloured USB micro cables?
[1295.42 → 1295.84] No.
[1296.74 → 1297.60] I was just like, really?
[1298.14 → 1300.14] And someone was like, oh, Linus, you should cover this.
[1300.18 → 1301.20] You should request a sample.
[1301.52 → 1301.84] No.
[1301.84 → 1304.36] And I'm just like, what could I possibly say?
[1304.58 → 1306.52] He also hates micro USB cables.
[1306.52 → 1315.04] With all the fiery passion that I can conjure in my soul, I hate micro USB.
[1315.44 → 1322.38] So, you know, a slightly more aesthetically pleasing micro USB cable is unlikely to light a fire for me.
[1322.54 → 1331.88] Something I also want to bring up about Infinite, if we're going to be bouncing around in topics, is the possible resurgence and comeback of the arcade.
[1333.34 → 1335.52] I brought this up when we first started talking about it.
[1335.52 → 1335.58] Yeah.
[1335.58 → 1340.10] Because if you have like a home Infinite, it's going to be this little tiny thing.
[1340.22 → 1345.88] If you go to a giant arcade, it could be Infinite style infinite room.
[1346.64 → 1347.04] Yeah.
[1347.52 → 1349.36] And it could be like a whole room.
[1349.38 → 1352.28] And that kind of thing might cost $100,000.
[1352.64 → 1354.30] So you're not going to be able to afford it in your house.
[1354.38 → 1354.62] Yeah.
[1355.10 → 1357.06] And you might not have space for it like at all.
[1357.06 → 1365.64] But every arcade in the lower mainland here in the Vancouver area is gone now because you can get so close to that experience at home.
[1365.64 → 1375.94] Whereas this could be a complete revival for that business model where it's like, look, you know, come in and pay $30 an hour to use whatever you want.
[1375.94 → 1382.94] And with virtual reality and the kinds of, I can imagine someone like Oculus having a professional grade option.
[1383.56 → 1383.76] Yeah.
[1383.90 → 1385.40] Versus a consumer grade option.
[1385.40 → 1391.92] So having like really advanced virtual reality with much better sensors, low latency cameras for motion tracking and all that.
[1391.92 → 1393.32] Like built all around into the room.
[1393.54 → 1394.60] Built into a room.
[1394.74 → 1400.92] I mean, that's the kind of thing that I would go, and I would pay $30 an hour to go and chill for a couple of hours.
[1400.92 → 1401.56] I'd try out.
[1401.60 → 1401.70] Yeah.
[1401.76 → 1405.74] If they had VR and AR experiences too, you could have both styles.
[1405.88 → 1411.76] That's my problem with the Infinite though is I really don't think that stationary...
[1411.76 → 1411.90] Okay.
[1412.18 → 1421.60] Outside of markets where like places like Europe and Japan where they're legitimately not going to have enough space for an augmented reality gaming experience.
[1421.80 → 1427.54] I think that augmented reality is going to be the one that draws me much more than VR.
[1427.54 → 1434.58] Like I would rather deal with the inconvenience of a backpack with like a heavy battery in it or something.
[1434.92 → 1435.02] Yeah.
[1435.24 → 1439.20] And a front facing camera that augments what I see.
[1439.34 → 1443.86] And then you're going to get like essentially paintball fields.
[1444.06 → 1444.30] Yes.
[1444.36 → 1449.10] Because one problem with that is if you just kind of cruise, if you do it in your house, it's a very limited setup.
[1449.26 → 1449.46] Yes.
[1449.64 → 1450.60] Every map's going to be the same.
[1450.66 → 1451.36] It's going to get really boring.
[1451.52 → 1456.74] If you do it outside, people are going to look at you like you're absolutely insane, and they're probably going to try and talk to you.
[1456.74 → 1458.32] And that's going to break the whole immersion experience.
[1458.44 → 1461.22] So it's going to have to be like a VR field.
[1461.90 → 1462.68] I think there's really...
[1462.68 → 1463.68] Which could be really cool.
[1464.00 → 1464.44] And you know what?
[1464.46 → 1467.80] It comes back to our tanks and RC tanks and planes idea.
[1468.32 → 1468.74] Where like...
[1469.30 → 1469.62] Oh man.
[1469.62 → 1470.82] People might not even get that reference.
[1470.94 → 1479.18] Actually piloting, you know, like a plane and being able to fire like virtual lasers and crap at other people's planes and like take them down.
[1479.18 → 1481.76] And the future is exciting.
[1482.86 → 1483.36] All right.
[1483.44 → 1485.24] So why don't we bring JJ on?
[1485.30 → 1486.82] Do you want to get him to join us here?
[1492.02 → 1493.56] I'm going to just tweet this out.
[1493.56 → 1501.88] Tune in live at twitch.tv slash Linus Tech.
[1501.88 → 1506.22] We actually have a watch page on linustechtips.com.
[1506.34 → 1507.88] I just don't know the URL.
[1508.52 → 1511.24] Which is sort of a terrible, terrible thing.
[1511.28 → 1512.30] Nobody does anymore.
[1513.14 → 1513.42] Yeah.
[1514.28 → 1514.76] Okay.
[1514.86 → 1515.26] All right.
[1515.44 → 1517.88] So bring on our...
[1517.88 → 1518.00] Oh.
[1518.36 → 1520.16] Is it working?
[1520.16 → 1520.56] Are you there?
[1522.56 → 1523.40] Hello, sir.
[1523.48 → 1524.28] Can you hear me?
[1524.62 → 1525.86] I can hear you, sir.
[1525.90 → 1526.52] I can hear you, sir.
[1526.52 → 1527.68] Fantastic.
[1528.30 → 1528.72] All right.
[1528.86 → 1534.98] So guys, give JJ a warm welcome and all that good stuff in the Twitch chat.
[1535.08 → 1544.84] For those of you who don't know who this gentleman is, he is the tech guru of Asus who knows all the things about all the Asus.
[1544.84 → 1551.86] I swear, I swear you could ask him any question about an Asus product, past, present, and probably even future.
[1552.06 → 1553.32] And he would know the answer.
[1553.78 → 1556.20] But that third category, he probably couldn't tell you about it.
[1556.20 → 1557.90] You are extremely nice.
[1557.96 → 1558.48] I thank you.
[1558.58 → 1559.06] I thank you.
[1559.16 → 1560.32] I try my best.
[1560.40 → 1561.08] I try my best.
[1561.48 → 1564.88] But that is a very humbling introduction.
[1565.06 → 1565.56] So thank you.
[1566.16 → 1566.66] All right.
[1566.76 → 1574.82] So I think the thing to do here is to invite people on the Twitter boards to go ahead.
[1574.94 → 1577.10] And we're going to do things a little bit differently this week.
[1577.10 → 1589.06] Rather than just tweeting at Linus Tech, any questions you have about Asus products, particularly Z97 and H97 motherboards, we want you to use hashtag.
[1589.06 → 1591.74] And I don't remember what it is anymore.
[1591.74 → 1595.56] And I can see that that's going to be a problem for me.
[1595.60 → 1595.74] Okay.
[1595.80 → 1597.82] So I'm going to invent one right off the bat.
[1598.18 → 1599.22] So it's going to be hashtagged.
[1599.72 → 1600.16] WAN live.
[1600.82 → 1601.52] WAN live?
[1601.62 → 1602.60] I thought it was WAN show live.
[1602.70 → 1602.90] Sure.
[1603.16 → 1604.86] Hashtag WAN show live.
[1605.06 → 1607.34] Go ahead and include that hashtag with your tweet.
[1607.56 → 1610.58] And we're going to be going through them and finding some good questions for JJ.
[1610.78 → 1613.42] But in the meantime, I'm going to kick things off.
[1613.48 → 1614.06] I'm going to go.
[1614.28 → 1614.54] Okay.
[1614.62 → 1614.88] Look.
[1615.54 → 1616.22] Z97.
[1618.10 → 1624.92] It's no gigantic secret that not a lot changed on the Intel side of things.
[1624.92 → 1633.18] So why don't you give us like a top three reasons why maybe users shouldn't necessarily upgrade from Z87 outright.
[1633.18 → 1640.60] But for people upgrading to LGA 1150, why would they spend an extra couple bucks for Z97 versus Z87?
[1641.94 → 1644.12] That's a perfect question.
[1644.60 → 1653.48] And I think it's kind of a tricky question to answer because I think both me, and you have, I'd say, like a different, I guess, approach than most people.
[1653.60 → 1662.44] Because since we see hardware every single generation, right, we kind of might think of it from the bleeding edge where we're going to upgrade from one platform to the next.
[1662.44 → 1667.82] But a lot of users, like you said, are necessarily sometimes coming over from a platform from two, three, four, five years ago.
[1667.88 → 1671.98] I mean, we've got people that are still coming over from P45 or X58 or different chipsets.
[1672.28 → 1681.24] But I think for this generation, you know, our goal, we always try to look at kind of two different perspectives of development, you know, chipset development and then board level development.
[1681.72 → 1689.04] So every generation, I think we try to put in the effort to put in new functions and features that are going to make things interesting and improve for the user's experience.
[1689.04 → 1690.64] So I think three things.
[1691.08 → 1692.00] I'm a big fan.
[1692.00 → 1703.52] And once again, of everything that we did on the auto-tuning side for the motherboards, I think that the new customization abilities that we have for this generation are pretty nuts as far as the granularity and control that you have for dynamic real-time auto overclocking.
[1704.18 → 1711.12] I'm really digging a lot of the new stuff that we did on the audio implementation, extend, you know, the previous designs that we had.
[1711.54 → 1713.82] And then I think kind of just total experience.
[1713.98 → 1720.60] You know, I think most of us, when we go about building a system, we kind of think of building the system in a lot of different ways.
[1720.60 → 1727.94] Sometimes it's the simplicity of just how smoothly something might work or how kind of something you didn't realize in terms of just enabling like this generation.
[1728.48 → 1735.76] You know, for us, it's easy to enable XMP, but, you know, we still see based off of market survey data that, you know, 50% of users never enable XMP on a motherboard.
[1735.76 → 1736.76] Right.
[1736.76 → 1742.76] So just having a physical switch on the motherboard that now a user can just, you know, flip into the on position, you know.
[1743.12 → 1746.28] Well, to me, it's something that I would never use in terms of having value for.
[1746.48 → 1749.98] We definitely know that there are users out there that would go, wow, that just makes sense.
[1750.02 → 1750.88] And I can just do that.
[1750.96 → 1756.30] And that gives me, you know, exactly what I'm using for because that's what I paid for in terms of the memory that I bought.
[1756.30 → 1759.68] So I have a question for you about the physical XMP switch.
[1759.78 → 1763.70] Is that something that the system integrators were asking for as well?
[1764.34 → 1768.30] No, actually, no, we didn't get any of that feedback from the system integrators.
[1768.46 → 1773.22] That was really based purely on the perspective of trying to find a more simplified solution.
[1773.22 → 1778.56] If you remember last generation, you know, we put in that easy one touch UEFI option for the XMP function.
[1778.56 → 1778.84] Right.
[1779.12 → 1788.28] And so this was just kind of the evolution of that, of trying to give you, you know, a very easy way to do it, not only within the UEFI, but a really easy way of doing it on the physical hardware level.
[1788.90 → 1795.70] So the next implementation will be like a giant red button this big with like a flashing LED behind it.
[1795.96 → 1796.56] Push this.
[1796.62 → 1797.36] Yeah, do this.
[1797.58 → 1798.78] Push this if you have memory.
[1799.42 → 1806.68] I think the next option is, you know, we're working on like on a micro automaton, a little, you know, guy that will come inside the box and he'll ask you questions.
[1806.78 → 1807.32] Do you need help?
[1807.32 → 1808.64] And he'll just do it for you.
[1808.72 → 1808.98] Exactly.
[1809.08 → 1814.68] He'll just kind of, you know, come on like your own personal golem, and then he'll go into your system, and he'll just enable everything for you.
[1814.82 → 1815.54] You won't do anything.
[1815.64 → 1819.60] He'll just, you just tell him, I want to do this and this and this, and he'll automatically do it for you.
[1819.74 → 1821.42] Can you create different skins for it?
[1821.50 → 1821.64] Yeah.
[1821.64 → 1825.98] So there can be like, there can be like the, like the Cortana, like, you know, digital girl.
[1826.14 → 1837.30] And then there can be like the like, remember Mad Mod Mike, that Nvidia brand asset that was like the guy with like a huge backpack and like screwdrivers and stuff.
[1837.32 → 1843.12] And then I think like a bonus one for someone who buys all the Asus components possible.
[1843.12 → 1853.44] So only people who have an Asus, like motherboard, graphics card, like a keyboard, mouse, sound card, and then it unlocks like a JJ avatar.
[1854.12 → 1854.28] Yeah.
[1854.28 → 1857.02] That would be pretty awesome.
[1857.32 → 1859.24] You know, actually, it's funny you talk about that.
[1859.36 → 1869.28] We're, we're going to be hopefully doing in a little bit sometime this quarter, we're going to be releasing these like really cool limited edition, really highly articulated, small DOG robots.
[1869.28 → 1879.50] So for like our diehard enthusiasts that really love, you know, DOG hardware and Asus hardware, they're going to have the opportunity to be able to pick up these really limited edition, high detail based figures.
[1880.06 → 1882.30] So, you know, I think that's all just part of the experience, right?
[1882.36 → 1889.14] You know, all of us as builders, we love dealing with hardware and anything that just makes things interesting and more engaging and adds to the experience is always cool.
[1889.14 → 1890.88] All right.
[1891.00 → 1903.02] So why don't I start with a first question from someone on the forum that actually reached out to me very politely and said, look, I'm sorry, I can't tune into the show live, but I really want to know the answer to this.
[1903.88 → 1912.42] Why did you guys go for an expansion card versus building Thunderbolt into the motherboards that you thought it made sense for?
[1912.42 → 1934.22] I mean, one of the things that you and I have talked about extensively is the way that Asus tries to build a motherboard according to how they think that user is going to use it down to everything from whether to use just, you know, integrated Intel SATA connectors to implementing a particular brand even of extra SATA connectors.
[1934.48 → 1937.54] So why didn't you guys go for something like the WS?
[1937.58 → 1939.76] It was the one real criticism I had of that board.
[1939.76 → 1942.34] Why didn't you go, OK, look, this is a workstation board.
[1942.50 → 1944.36] It should have Thunderbolt on it right off the bat.
[1944.90 → 1944.98] Yeah.
[1945.36 → 1946.90] Yeah, no, you make a perfect point.
[1947.00 → 1948.70] And that was a really hard decision to make.
[1948.84 → 1954.00] You know, for us, Thunderbolt is still continuing to be kind of an emerging technology that we're seeing get utilized.
[1954.14 → 1955.48] And we're heavily involved.
[1955.62 → 1958.80] You know, I myself, I actually went to two Thunderbolt plug fests this generation.
[1958.94 → 1963.22] We worked with, I think, over 160 vendors that are making all kinds of Thunderbolt accessories.
[1963.44 → 1965.00] So we definitely still value it.
[1965.12 → 1968.84] I mean, compared to any other vendor, no other vendor has more Thunderbolt solutions than us.
[1968.84 → 1973.98] And I think it just came down to a question of resource, layout consideration, and cost.
[1974.72 → 1981.60] You know, while there's definitely going to be a segmentation, even within that content creation community, like you talked about for a WS model, that would see value in Thunderbolt.
[1981.76 → 1985.28] The majority of those users as a whole are not going to be utilizing Thunderbolt.
[1985.38 → 1992.74] They will be utilizing your classic interconnects, whether they're going to be USB or whether it's going to be actually even gigabit-based connectivity on a local-based network.
[1992.74 → 1993.34] Yeah.
[1993.34 → 2002.46] So in that situation, I think we saw the value of let's still give them that ability to be able to have Thunderbolt, right, on the boards, but not necessarily have to have them to pay the premium.
[2002.46 → 2012.54] Because when you do look at the cost, the BOM cost, so the bill of material cost on Thunderbolt, it is probably within the top three most expensive hardware specs to put on a motherboard.
[2012.82 → 2014.88] So it's not like a small add-on cost.
[2015.04 → 2018.24] Sometimes there are some stuff that it's a really marginal cost to implement on the board.
[2018.66 → 2023.96] So it's a pretty big increase in terms of impacting the MSRP, so the final retail price of the motherboard.
[2023.96 → 2026.98] Plus there is physical space layout considerations.
[2027.68 → 2035.18] So this Generation WS, actually, we did incorporate the same type of isolated audio design that we had started to implement on the DOG series.
[2035.52 → 2047.74] So that kind of implementation, balancing all that thing out in terms of space and real estate and everything else out, it was just kind of a managed kind of implementation where we said, okay, you know, it probably makes sense, but we still have to balance everything out.
[2047.74 → 2056.44] And even little things like you wouldn't keep in mind, like the Thunderbolt board still has 1394, so it's our only active Z97 SKU that actually has 1394.
[2056.86 → 2057.72] I did notice that.
[2057.98 → 2060.64] Because we still actually have users in that content creation community.
[2060.76 → 2062.70] They've made huge investment for FireWire.
[2062.86 → 2065.84] And actually the usage model is still actually a little bit higher than Thunderbolt.
[2066.14 → 2072.68] We probably see that by the end of this year, finally eclipsing that Thunderbolt will even be higher than the existing base of 1394.
[2072.94 → 2075.28] But that 1394 chip takes up space, right?
[2075.28 → 2078.54] So if we probably maybe had taken that out, could have probably maybe offset it.
[2078.64 → 2081.26] So it just literally comes down to a balance factor.
[2081.42 → 2085.34] You know, we'd love to put everything that we could on there, but that's kind of the best compromise.
[2085.58 → 2091.72] But the cool thing about it is, you know, Thunderbolt across, what, like 16 SKUs, and all you got to do is just drop in the card, right?
[2092.96 → 2093.52] All right.
[2093.54 → 2095.22] I can see why you made the compromise.
[2095.60 → 2099.58] Now, here's something that I wish everyone would quit compromising on.
[2099.58 → 2102.56] And you can go, like, let's call this, like, off the record.
[2102.70 → 2103.38] Your opinion.
[2103.38 → 2105.70] I will do my best.
[2106.02 → 2110.80] Looking into the crystal ball, when are we going to finally see 10 gigabit Ethernet?
[2110.86 → 2113.50] I've seen some of the guys in Twitch chat talking about 10 gig.
[2113.62 → 2120.22] Because right now, no one seems to be willing to just do this and make it a consumer technology.
[2120.36 → 2126.60] I think Netgear has, like, one 8-port switch on New egg that's still hundreds of dollars.
[2126.60 → 2131.96] And you can buy NIC cards for in the $200 to $300 range.
[2132.68 → 2135.68] The cabling itself has caught up at this point.
[2135.78 → 2138.44] So you can get Cat 6A cable for a reasonable price.
[2139.06 → 2143.96] How much, legitimately, like, if you had to just guess, and you can tell me the number is probably wrong.
[2144.02 → 2144.72] You can disclaim it.
[2144.78 → 2145.68] This number is wrong.
[2145.68 → 2146.70] But if I, no, no, no, no.
[2147.34 → 2151.08] How much would a 10 gigabit implementation on a motherboard cost?
[2151.20 → 2152.68] And what's the problem right now?
[2152.80 → 2153.54] Why can't we do it?
[2154.28 → 2157.00] It really comes down to just, it's really, it's a cost factor.
[2157.10 → 2158.06] It's totally possible.
[2158.40 → 2159.44] We could entirely do it.
[2159.44 → 2169.74] And, you know, while there is stuff that I can't talk about as far as on the current chipset portfolio, you can imagine that there are things coming down the pipeline later on where that could be a possibility of something that you would want to be incorporated.
[2170.10 → 2180.18] So we are evaluating looking at 10 gig e-solutions on base platforms, but more probably in the server and workstation demographic than we would see in the traditional kind of, like, Z97.
[2180.18 → 2182.68] So the performance kind of market space.
[2182.68 → 2190.68] But from a cost standpoint, you're talking that you could easily take a motherboard that might, let's say, traditionally be, let's say, like a $250 motherboard, $300 motherboard.
[2190.84 → 2194.26] So that's a relatively high-end enthusiast Z97-based board.
[2194.50 → 2199.22] And you could add an MSRP of beyond $200 to be able to add 10 gig e.
[2199.54 → 2202.64] So that's a huge cost increase to the consumer.
[2202.80 → 2208.22] You know, I'm sure, like, foreign people would go, this is crazy, $200 more, right?
[2208.22 → 2215.86] Of course, for the users that know the benefit of what they would be able to do in leveraging a 10 gig e-solution, they would appreciate that.
[2215.94 → 2220.70] And they would also look at the cost of going, hey, maybe an add-in card is at least maybe $350.
[2221.32 → 2225.62] So having to pay $200 and having it integrated, I'm ready to do that.
[2226.26 → 2229.66] But we're looking at it actually, I think, in a more complete rollout strategy.
[2229.86 → 2234.56] You know, we're evaluating actually 10 gig e, not just for our motherboards, but also for our entire networking division.
[2234.56 → 2236.44] So definitely stay tuned.
[2236.58 → 2238.94] You know, you're going to see more of that coming down the pipeline from us.
[2239.36 → 2241.62] But, you know, it really just comes down to cost.
[2241.80 → 2245.14] If users say, hey, we're willing to take on the cost, then we can do it.
[2245.34 → 2248.88] This same stuff even rolls into, like, minority for, like, really high-end.
[2249.18 → 2255.52] We've done some really crazy, interesting designs for X79 and trying to do an ultra-small form factor X79 minority.
[2255.94 → 2261.88] And I'm not going to say it's impossible because we've made some fascinating design choices to be able to do something like that.
[2261.88 → 2263.94] And then I have people tell me, oh, we'll do it.
[2263.94 → 2271.72] But then there's always that difference between what's the real market reality, and what's the niche reality of people saying, oh, we'll buy this, right?
[2272.66 → 2272.88] Yeah.
[2273.02 → 2281.30] Because, you know, for us to kick off a board, you know, you're at least talking six to eight months development time, a high amount of R&D costs, bandwidth and resource and stuff like that.
[2281.44 → 2283.32] And so I could probably make it.
[2283.38 → 2285.14] I could make an X79 minority.
[2285.18 → 2286.88] It could be fascinating as far as the way it worked.
[2287.12 → 2290.46] But would you really be willing to pay, you know, $450, $500 for that board?
[2290.46 → 2290.90] Yeah.
[2291.90 → 2292.22] Ah.
[2292.68 → 2294.86] And that would be a tough pill to swallow.
[2295.04 → 2306.68] I mean, I could see an X79-ITX board being worth a small premium, you know, maybe $250, $275 for, you know, let's call it like a deluxe class board.
[2306.84 → 2312.82] You know, something pretty equivalent to, you know, a Z97 or a Z87-ITX board.
[2312.82 → 2322.62] But if you started to tell me it's $400, $500, that's a really tough pill to swallow, especially when you factor in that you're going to need some other pretty specialized hardware to even build that rig.
[2323.90 → 2329.44] You know, you're going to want, Silverstone is, I think, the only one that I'm aware of with an 80-plus gold power supply.
[2329.64 → 2333.18] That's a 450-watt unit that's an SFX power supply.
[2333.18 → 2336.36] So this is a very special machine at this point.
[2336.72 → 2342.62] And you think about, like, how many times, guys, viewers, think about how many times on a forum you've seen a machine that special.
[2343.54 → 2344.98] How many times have you seen that power supply?
[2346.32 → 2346.68] Yeah.
[2346.68 → 2351.26] And I think the other thing, too, is, you know, I mean, we're okay making those type of advancements.
[2351.36 → 2360.28] I mean, if you look at our history, we're not necessarily afraid to buck the trend and sometimes put on these really specialized technologies that roll out over time to other products over time.
[2360.94 → 2363.12] You know, because we have users that realize that.
[2363.20 → 2364.26] And that's part of the community.
[2364.40 → 2369.22] One of the really cool things about the PC DIY community is in itself that people will embrace the technology.
[2369.32 → 2370.02] They'll pay a premium.
[2370.02 → 2380.94] And while not everybody benefits from it right away, actually, that's the really cool thing is that as products scale over time, you know, that initial investment actually does scale out to more products over time.
[2381.64 → 2387.52] You know, so as long as you can get enough of those people to be supportive of that, then you can see really cool and innovative product like that.
[2387.56 → 2388.16] It just depends.
[2388.26 → 2390.52] Do we really have enough people for these type of solutions?
[2390.62 → 2395.84] In the same way I get every day, I get people asking me, I want high-performance AM3 mini IT, right?
[2396.40 → 2396.64] Yeah.
[2396.72 → 2397.58] So stuff like that.
[2397.58 → 2397.96] Yeah.
[2398.28 → 2398.64] Okay.
[2398.64 → 2405.44] Now, leading into investing in the future and it's paying off for everyone, I think this is a great discussion topic.
[2405.56 → 2408.26] And don't worry, JJ, I'll let you talk about Z97 at some point.
[2408.58 → 2409.24] Oh, no worries, man.
[2409.82 → 2413.26] Let's talk PG278Q DOG Swift.
[2413.44 → 2414.42] You had to do it, right?
[2414.50 → 2416.36] You just had to ask about it, right?
[2416.40 → 2416.62] Yeah.
[2416.74 → 2417.76] But I got more.
[2417.98 → 2425.46] Oh, it gets more complicated than that because I'm going to also throw at you the Acer announcement today of their 4K G-Sync monitor.
[2425.46 → 2437.76] And then I'm going to throw this at you again, and I'm going to go, is this all just irrelevant with the VESA 1.2a standard coming out supporting AMD's Free Sync or Active Sync?
[2437.76 → 2439.92] Like, is G-Sync even relevant anymore?
[2440.36 → 2442.50] What do you – again, real thoughts.
[2442.72 → 2444.00] Like, what do you think?
[2444.22 → 2446.06] You don't even have to give a concrete answer here.
[2446.16 → 2446.28] Yeah.
[2446.28 → 2448.42] So you make a lot of perfect points.
[2448.54 → 2454.86] So I think first, if we just tackle the first point in terms of G-Sync's relevancy, it's entirely relevant.
[2455.02 → 2461.46] The first and foremost reason is because while you haven't seen physical MP product, it's already a technology that's proven.
[2461.62 → 2462.92] It's in integrator solutions.
[2463.14 → 2466.84] Right now, they're working on it, and they're finalizing the products to come to the market.
[2466.84 → 2478.32] So this is a big difference than, let's say, something a ratified specification or ratified standard that's coming into its play and then still has to be actually proven in real design and implementation.
[2479.26 → 2479.68] I see.
[2479.68 → 2491.86] Regardless of whether something is a physical implementation or a firmware layer specification or something that occurs on a much more minor level that's purely on a software basis, these also things have to be proven in the real world.
[2492.28 → 2507.28] And I can tell you the learning curve just alone for our modern development team along with NVIDIA at actually taking what they thought was a monitor kind of driving circuit board and then having to approach that in the real world were two entirely different things.
[2507.28 → 2515.50] We had to consider things that NVIDIA hadn't factored in, like colour calibration profile support, which is normally part of, let's say, the electronics package in a monitor.
[2515.74 → 2524.90] But we had to work with their team to be able to actually integrate the ability to have colour controls because that wasn't something that was inherently part of the FPGA package because NVIDIA was thinking from a different perspective.
[2525.46 → 2527.48] So they went gaming.
[2528.52 → 2537.18] It's funny because NVIDIA sometimes gets criticized for being, you know, oh, you guys are completely focused on grid, or you're completely focused on mobile.
[2537.60 → 2543.62] But then they go, and they bring something like G-Sync to market, and they literally haven't even thought about it beyond, yeah, gaming.
[2544.14 → 2544.32] Yeah.
[2544.46 → 2547.06] And I mean, that's, you know, the reality of every company.
[2547.18 → 2552.74] I mean, sometimes you run up against, you know, experience and, you know, just your internal kind of perspective.
[2552.98 → 2553.38] Right.
[2553.40 → 2557.38] And that's where it's a balance that they've worked with us to leverage our experience in monitor design.
[2557.46 → 2560.78] And we're leveraging their experience at that IC-based design in that package.
[2560.78 → 2561.06] Right.
[2561.30 → 2562.30] For what they're doing there.
[2562.42 → 2566.24] So I think that still in that aspect, there's still a lot of logic.
[2566.24 → 2579.68] And there are a lot of other things that NVIDIA is doing within the FPGA and the overall IP that they're developing behind G-Sync that in the long term, not just right now, but what you're going to be able to do over time with it, actually continues to paint the purpose of having a specialized IC.
[2579.86 → 2581.34] Now, I love the aspect.
[2581.50 → 2585.20] And ASUS, as you know, we're not biased to any vendor.
[2585.34 → 2585.44] Right.
[2585.48 → 2586.64] We produce AMD solutions.
[2586.76 → 2587.50] We produce NVIDIA.
[2587.60 → 2588.62] We produce Intel chipsets.
[2588.62 → 2589.98] And we produce AMD chipsets.
[2589.98 → 2594.12] So from our perspective, we want to be able to give the consumers the most choice possible.
[2594.90 → 2595.26] Right.
[2595.46 → 2604.86] So, you know, in that perspective, right, you know, what you're seeing with the new Visa update, you're going to have more flexibility, have a more open ecosystem.
[2604.86 → 2605.96] So that's great as well.
[2606.10 → 2610.66] But I think all of us at the end of the day, what we care first and foremost about is how something works.
[2610.66 → 2622.10] Even if it's a proprietary solution, if it works really, really, really, really well and there are no issues with it, I'm okay with it being proprietary if it works outstanding, and it doesn't have any bugs, and it doesn't have issues, and it just works.
[2622.28 → 2622.40] Right.
[2622.56 → 2629.38] I mean, that's a proven example of, you know, you're going to get a lot of people that they say, hey, we wish you gave more Linux support.
[2629.38 → 2637.32] Well, it's really hard to have Linux support from a chipset development when you have 20 different distros that all have their different kernels, and they all have to be compiled differently.
[2637.50 → 2637.62] Right.
[2637.70 → 2642.08] When you then tell the chipset company, hey, you can design a driver for Windows, and it's just one platform.
[2642.40 → 2642.80] Right.
[2642.88 → 2644.92] So it's very much kind of that same thing.
[2644.98 → 2647.88] There are a lot of things to consider in that.
[2648.28 → 2649.94] So I think G-Sync is still relevant.
[2650.36 → 2656.38] I still think we're going to totally embrace and look at how we can incorporate the updated Visa spec in monitors over time.
[2656.38 → 2670.52] And then from there, you know, the 4K proposition, as far as that goes into it, I think everybody's interested to continue to see just improved gaming performance on all types of monitors, regardless of whether it's 4K, whether it's going to be new TNN, whether it's going to be IPS.
[2670.64 → 2671.30] I don't think it matters.
[2671.40 → 2675.96] I think everybody just wants to continue to see improved and evolved monitor type designs.
[2676.16 → 2677.06] So I give kudos.
[2677.32 → 2680.36] Hey, you know, Acer's done an interesting design there with the 4K.
[2680.72 → 2684.82] I think for us still, as you guys know, 4K is a fascinating technology.
[2684.82 → 2687.58] I mean, we're launching our right now, our brand-new PB monitor.
[2687.76 → 2689.22] It's going to be really price aggressive.
[2689.44 → 2690.06] I know. I have one.
[2690.76 → 2691.70] There you go. Right.
[2691.78 → 2693.54] So, you know, we're all behind that.
[2693.70 → 2699.98] But, you know, to every single one of these, right, when you factor in a monitor, there's so much more to consider than just a monitor.
[2700.10 → 2702.34] Right. It's, you know, the games that you're playing.
[2702.56 → 2704.94] It's the GPUs that you're going to be running in the system.
[2705.30 → 2706.84] So there are a lot of different perspectives.
[2707.14 → 2711.26] So there's not going to be every one monitor that rules them all, I think, in that perspective.
[2711.42 → 2711.60] Right.
[2711.98 → 2713.02] You can maybe get close.
[2713.02 → 2716.30] Maybe we could get pretty close to having some right specs to stuff.
[2716.44 → 2718.42] But a lot of this is driven by so many different things.
[2718.52 → 2723.86] So for us, we're going to continue to embrace, I think, all the technologies on the market and listen to you guys at what you guys want.
[2724.72 → 2725.30] All right.
[2725.34 → 2728.24] Now, I have another question from Omid.
[2728.24 → 2743.48] Now, given that Intel didn't change much going from Z87 to Z97, and I think you'd be hard-pressed to find, like, you know, a massive change logs from the ASUS side, given that it wasn't really necessary.
[2743.48 → 2752.08] Why are some reviewers finding they're getting better overclocking results and better temps on Z97 on the same Haswell chips?
[2752.08 → 2756.46] You know, part of this is sometimes actually time differential.
[2756.92 → 2759.38] There are changes in the overall what's called MEI.
[2759.94 → 2760.82] It's fascinating.
[2760.98 → 2761.66] We're seeing some of this.
[2761.72 → 2768.90] Some of this stuff we're asking reviewers to go back and evaluate because in our internal analysis, it's pretty much actually par, par for par.
[2768.90 → 2773.40] But there are some technical implementations that sometimes actually reviewers don't fully evaluate.
[2773.78 → 2789.36] One of the really things that's interesting with the fibre, so that integrated voltage regulator, and then what's called your VCC in as far as voltage, is that the voltage that you see defined within something like CPU-Z is not actually your real necessarily voltage.
[2789.60 → 2792.62] That's the voltage that's actually being communicated by the fibre.
[2792.62 → 2799.78] But the voltage or the VCC input can actually be lower than that voltage, and then based on efficiency, you can have a different measurement.
[2800.26 → 2809.64] So two boards could actually be effectively giving you the same voltage but can achieve it in different ways if, let's say, one has a lower VCC in and one has a higher VCC in.
[2810.14 → 2812.66] So that can account actually for temperature differential.
[2812.66 → 2833.06] The other thing is that over time, if let's say they first tested some boards like six months ago, and then new tuning has come out where they make optimizations to actually load policies, and they make changes to actually different parts of the UEFI that change different actually conditioning parameters, whether it's the VRM efficiency or different parameter parameters, all those things can sometimes offset a little bit of numbers.
[2833.06 → 2846.64] But I can tell you from our internal analysis overall, users should generally, if you take a 4770K, 4670K between a Z87 platform and then a Z97 platform, the actual OCA experience is pretty much linear.
[2846.84 → 2847.62] It's the same.
[2847.70 → 2851.70] You're not getting a diminished experience, and you're not getting actually a better experience.
[2851.80 → 2853.56] It's the same clocking experience.
[2853.90 → 2860.42] For our boards, we do have a revised DRAM topology, so DRAM topology scaling is even a little bit better, so you can even get higher.
[2860.42 → 2866.02] But to real-world users, it's not really relevant because most users are maybe going up to 2130 to 2400.
[2866.44 → 2870.64] So regardless that we can do higher memory dividers, it doesn't really impact the real user.
[2871.24 → 2888.20] So most of this really just comes down to difference in sometimes the underlying code base, changes in, let's say, voltage rules and policies that sometimes the viewers aren't always, let's say, always understanding of or not maybe fully accounting for because they might be looking for just one numerical value versus another numerical value.
[2888.98 → 2889.38] Yep.
[2889.38 → 2890.74] All right.
[2890.88 → 2892.82] So I've got another one for you.
[2892.82 → 2916.82] I guess along the lines of Z87 to Z97 changes again, because I did promise I'd give you an opportunity to cover that with us here, is what are the biggest changes between, or the biggest differences that you guys have aimed to deliver here with the Z97 boards, whether it's compared to what the competition's doing, and you don't have to name any names, or whether it's compared to the last generation Z87 implementations.
[2916.82 → 2922.94] Well, you know, for us, I mean, you know, we try to, we're always in the game of pushing the envelope, right?
[2922.94 → 2928.80] We're always going to try to look at what the experience is, and can we make those experiences better, regardless of what it is.
[2929.80 → 2943.80] You know, I think probably the biggest ones that we did that they might seem small, but when you really kind of look at them in the bigger picture, they were really hard to implement, but they really give a whole nother level of experience, are going to be really in the auto-tune technologies, in the sound, and with the fan controls.
[2943.80 → 2948.48] But, I mean, there's been improvements to every single aspect, but, you know, fan control stuff is pretty awesome, right?
[2948.56 → 2954.68] The last previous generations, we'd always talked about having that full fan header control for every single header, you know, 3-pin and 4-pin support.
[2954.88 → 2966.46] But this year, having the ability to go to every single header and manually define whether it's a PWM or DC-based control is awesome, because now that gives you the ability that if you want to put PWM splitters on there,
[2966.46 → 2978.88] you want to get like a Source 530 and have those three front intake fans all be regulated by one chassis fan header all in the same signal, bam, power those fans from the PSU, get them all tuned with the same actual fan curve, and you're rocking and rolling, right?
[2978.90 → 2985.62] That's sweet, because it just adds a whole nother level of granularity and control how you set up your airflow, and you set up your experience.
[2986.42 → 2994.20] And you know what's funny is the thing that really blew me away about the new fan control is one that you didn't even mention,
[2994.20 → 3000.38] and that's the fact that it's within the UEFI now, and I can define all those curves in basic mode.
[3000.66 → 3004.14] I click one thing, and I go, yep, header by header.
[3004.46 → 3005.64] Here's the curve I want.
[3005.72 → 3006.98] I want it on a predefined curve.
[3007.06 → 3011.28] I want to do my own manual curve, because, again, real talk time.
[3011.38 → 3012.20] This is a WAN show.
[3012.46 → 3012.94] We're casual.
[3013.30 → 3015.04] I don't really like AI Suite very much.
[3015.46 → 3020.52] It has been a big problem for me at various times throughout its history,
[3020.52 → 3024.16] and while I haven't tried it in the last probably three to six months,
[3025.22 → 3029.06] I've tried it fairly recently enough that I just am not a huge fan.
[3029.28 → 3033.90] Whereas UEFI implementation of something like that, wow, what a godsend,
[3034.00 → 3038.34] because now I can really take advantage of that feature in a way that is bulletproof.
[3038.62 → 3042.48] And one thing to not shoot at AI Suite, despite I don't use it either,
[3042.88 → 3046.10] is that getting away from the software implementation is just nice anyway,
[3046.10 → 3049.06] because if you reformat your computer or change out a drive or do whatever,
[3049.40 → 3052.54] that's less that you have to think about when you're setting everything back up again.
[3052.76 → 3052.88] Yeah.
[3053.02 → 3055.58] Yeah, I think that applies more to you guys as reviewers, right?
[3055.62 → 3059.88] Most users, you know, they talk about actually how long they can try to keep rolling over their OS.
[3060.18 → 3063.04] We see so many people take OSes from one chipset to another chipset,
[3063.20 → 3064.54] and they don't ever even reinstall.
[3065.50 → 3068.02] You know, but I guess that'll be my challenge is to win you over,
[3068.12 → 3070.98] because, you know, that's one thing that we work really hard on is the software suite.
[3071.10 → 3072.84] But, you know, that is a good example.
[3072.84 → 3076.92] You know, we had to work really hard on actually putting in that full graphical fan turf,
[3077.26 → 3078.66] the calibration and all that stuff.
[3078.88 → 3080.60] And literally, it's redundant.
[3080.86 → 3084.66] We spent time and effort to do something that we had already done two years before,
[3084.66 → 3088.76] but we did it just to be able to give more of our base of users more accessibility.
[3089.06 → 3093.16] So whether it's guys that, for whatever reason, don't want to embrace the software,
[3093.64 → 3095.40] well, then we can give it to you in another direction,
[3095.40 → 3097.44] and you can still get that same experience.
[3097.92 → 3100.12] And then you added on, you know, rounding that all out,
[3100.12 → 3102.34] giving you the temperature input control per header.
[3102.34 → 3104.54] I mean, that's awesome, right, that you can go in and say,
[3104.64 → 3108.46] hey, my front intake fan should not have to respond to my CPU, right?
[3108.86 → 3110.56] Why can't that respond to my motherboard?
[3110.76 → 3112.38] Why can't that respond to my PCH?
[3112.74 → 3114.82] Why can't that respond to another temperature input?
[3115.90 → 3118.52] So, you know, and I think the biggest part, you know,
[3118.54 → 3121.12] is a lot of time we get pigeon held as being the premium vendor,
[3121.24 → 3122.14] the more expensive vendor.
[3122.58 → 3124.42] Look at the Z97-8.
[3124.58 → 3127.60] Again, there is not a better value proposition board, in my opinion.
[3128.26 → 3131.28] $140 motherboard that has that class of fan controls,
[3131.28 → 3134.32] you know, I don't want to, you know, bring competitors into it.
[3134.36 → 3135.94] You know, guys, you know me long enough.
[3136.04 → 3139.06] I'm not that kind of guy that I bash on, you know, the other guys.
[3139.46 → 3143.28] But Gigabyte, AS Rock, MSI, none of them...
[3143.28 → 3144.10] But everyone.
[3144.76 → 3145.52] Everyone else.
[3146.32 → 3147.22] None of them have that.
[3147.24 → 3148.96] I'm going to just combo punch the entire team right now.
[3149.18 → 3152.02] Their highest-end motherboard doesn't have that fan control
[3152.02 → 3153.60] that I have on a $140 motherboard.
[3153.86 → 3154.98] When you talk about value,
[3155.48 → 3157.76] I don't know how much it gets better than that from a value proposition.
[3157.76 → 3158.56] You know what?
[3158.62 → 3162.06] The funny thing about you saying that is I can imagine already.
[3162.24 → 3163.90] I mean, there's a delay on the Twitch stream,
[3164.16 → 3167.54] but I can already imagine what's going to happen in about 20 seconds
[3167.54 → 3169.48] where people are going to say,
[3169.80 → 3171.62] oh, I don't care about that fan control.
[3171.72 → 3172.94] That doesn't have a value for me.
[3173.00 → 3173.78] I don't really care.
[3173.92 → 3176.24] I like all my fans running at 100% or whatever else.
[3176.52 → 3179.68] But my response to that is, you know what?
[3179.72 → 3182.82] There are some people who care a lot about that,
[3182.82 → 3188.18] and two of them sitting in this room have spent over $150
[3188.18 → 3192.74] on a software fan controller that basically...
[3192.74 → 3193.46] Hardware fan controller.
[3193.58 → 3193.80] Sorry.
[3193.98 → 3196.98] Hardware fan controller that we have to configure through software
[3196.98 → 3199.40] that's much flakier than AI Suite has ever been.
[3199.46 → 3199.86] Oh, a lot worse.
[3200.42 → 3204.08] Just to get that functionality that you guys are now including on a board
[3204.08 → 3207.28] that costs less than what we paid for an M3 T-balancer.
[3207.52 → 3210.04] So someone out there appreciates it,
[3210.04 → 3214.08] even if not everybody does, and it is a definite value add.
[3214.20 → 3216.60] Even if it's possibly the only two people in Canada.
[3216.92 → 3217.26] Well, no.
[3218.02 → 3218.82] There's definitely...
[3218.82 → 3221.64] I mean, we know for sure that it's a lot more people than just you guys.
[3222.22 → 3223.74] You know, it's just the bigger thing is sometimes
[3223.74 → 3226.38] just edifying people and helping them understand this.
[3226.52 → 3227.20] And it's hard.
[3227.36 → 3228.56] You know, we talked about this last time.
[3228.78 → 3231.64] This is not an easy game to be in when there are so many features
[3231.64 → 3234.70] and there are so many functions to be cognizant and to be aware of.
[3234.76 → 3235.74] But, you know, we work on it.
[3235.86 → 3238.16] But, you know, I think, like I said, the fan controls,
[3238.16 → 3239.76] I think the audio tuning stuff is awesome.
[3239.76 → 3244.22] I mean, this generation, you're having the ability to do target temperature-based overclocking
[3244.22 → 3248.14] so that if you want to have the overclock be limited to 70C or 80C
[3248.14 → 3251.72] and it's only going to do it to that, you know, having it be frequency-based,
[3251.98 → 3256.00] having the app tuning stuff right where you can conditionally profile your application
[3256.00 → 3259.00] to a specific overclock and have that dynamically adjust things
[3259.00 → 3260.72] like network prioritization or audio stuff.
[3260.82 → 3262.22] I mean, I think crazy stuff.
[3262.30 → 3264.96] If you start to really evaluate some of these functions and features,
[3265.00 → 3267.54] it's kind of crazy that you're getting this level of control.
[3267.54 → 3269.44] And while you guys might not be using the software,
[3269.90 → 3273.06] to make this end user available, the power and class of this functionality,
[3273.40 → 3276.48] I don't think people thought, you know, especially three years ago, four years ago,
[3276.78 → 3278.92] every year people say, yeah, there's not more that you can do.
[3279.40 → 3280.60] It's all over.
[3280.74 → 3282.84] There's no more innovation that can be done.
[3282.94 → 3284.24] And then you do stuff like this and people go,
[3284.46 → 3287.34] how come this hasn't been on a motherboard for the last five years?
[3287.86 → 3288.06] Right?
[3288.06 → 3291.84] And the funny thing is, even I find myself doing it sometimes,
[3292.00 → 3296.24] where I'll be using all the latest stuff, because that's what I generally use.
[3297.28 → 3301.92] And then, well, no, really, though, because whenever we're evaluating something,
[3302.02 → 3304.38] we don't benchmark whatever is five years old.
[3304.98 → 3305.52] Yeah, I've had it before.
[3305.78 → 3307.24] Yeah, but it doesn't happen very often.
[3307.36 → 3308.44] But that's exactly it.
[3308.44 → 3323.28] And I was like, oh, yeah, it's got like a dual-core,
[3323.48 → 3326.42] so it's relatively low, you know, power consumption or whatever,
[3326.58 → 3327.84] also relatively low performance,
[3327.94 → 3330.34] so I don't mind tying it up in that box just to try it out.
[3330.82 → 3335.06] And I was blown away by just all the crap it didn't have.
[3335.06 → 3340.56] Even though I didn't feel like between age 55 and now,
[3340.70 → 3344.22] I didn't really feel like there was any kind of huge generational improvement in features,
[3344.68 → 3346.94] I was just like, oh, this thing doesn't have anything.
[3347.06 → 3348.50] It doesn't have onboard buttons.
[3348.68 → 3349.74] It doesn't have like...
[3349.74 → 3354.08] Going back to those classic old school blue screen Phoenix BIOS setups.
[3354.20 → 3354.58] I know.
[3354.76 → 3357.30] It's like, oh, wow, yeah, this has been a while, actually.
[3358.14 → 3360.48] And that's actually, it's perfect that you bring that up,
[3360.52 → 3363.76] because that's highlighting back to your, I think, your very first question, right?
[3363.76 → 3366.22] Or maybe like your second one about people upgrading.
[3366.62 → 3368.84] This is where I think it's sometimes hard, as you guys, reviewers,
[3369.02 → 3373.12] is that the value proposition, sometimes you kind of go this meh mentality, right?
[3373.18 → 3374.54] When a new chipset comes out,
[3374.60 → 3377.10] because you guys are maybe looking at it right from the previous one.
[3377.24 → 3380.54] But I think that we've done a lot to improve from Z87 to Z97.
[3380.94 → 3382.76] But it is also really important to remember,
[3382.88 → 3384.92] I mean, you guys have a really, really great community.
[3385.26 → 3388.36] And so you guys know about the systems that these users have.
[3388.36 → 3392.08] But, you know, imagine somebody right now coming over from an X58 platform
[3392.08 → 3395.10] to just like our Dash A or our Pro motherboard,
[3395.58 → 3399.08] and everything that they're getting just on the board level, right?
[3399.18 → 3401.14] Let's not forget the things that are chipset derived,
[3401.40 → 3403.00] but just on the board functionality level,
[3403.16 → 3407.22] there's an insane amount of stuff that they totally just are not even remotely near
[3407.22 → 3409.96] coming over from that chipset to this chipset.
[3409.96 → 3415.98] All right, so JJ, this is a question from Louis A. Moon,
[3416.56 → 3419.10] and I tend to agree with him.
[3419.88 → 3423.76] Why don't you use right-angle USB 3 connectors?
[3424.90 → 3428.02] So if you actually notice, we do use it on the Sabre tooth series,
[3428.14 → 3430.78] and we've actually done it now for, I think, three generations.
[3431.80 → 3436.00] But we don't do it as a whole because we still see actually chassis compatibility issues.
[3436.00 → 3440.50] So I think really the only company that's really kind of gunshot about it is EGA.
[3441.66 → 3446.60] And we've, like I said, we just don't do it because we still see enough issues with that.
[3446.68 → 3450.56] There are some chassis where the actual space, if you were to right-angle that cable,
[3450.76 → 3453.20] it actually will obstruct into the hard drive cage.
[3453.34 → 3455.60] So it's a bit tight in that spacing.
[3455.72 → 3459.54] And as you know, that USB 3 header, it's a fat, blocky header,
[3459.64 → 3462.38] and it's really hard to deal with in terms of that.
[3462.38 → 3468.64] And what we're actually, I think, playing around with more is that we're trying to develop kind of like a USB 3Q connector
[3468.64 → 3471.12] so that you could actually put that in,
[3471.42 → 3478.04] and it'll have actually a flexible cable that you could then run through your routing holes in your chassis.
[3478.56 → 3482.04] The tricky thing about that is that there's a cost.
[3482.68 → 3486.60] So you actually have to pay a royalty cost every time you do a USB 3 spec.
[3486.60 → 3494.88] This is why a lot of the chassis, if you notice, there's like a huge drop-off between entry-level chassis having front USB 3
[3494.88 → 3497.12] and then all of them having USB 2, right?
[3497.40 → 3501.74] And you saw like this weird area where there was like stuff from NZXT or Cooler Master, these other ones,
[3501.88 → 3504.90] where they only have like one front USB 3.
[3505.18 → 3505.52] Yeah.
[3505.74 → 3507.20] That's because the cost.
[3507.66 → 3509.96] So they charge you for this USB 3 header.
[3509.96 → 3516.74] So, you know, we're looking at trying to do that, but then we would have to pay the cost for putting the adapter and do all that stuff.
[3517.20 → 3523.52] But that's really what it comes down to is it's literally right now that if we saw more chassis,
[3523.94 → 3529.44] now the argument could be said, well, you know, if we do it maybe on higher-end boards, maybe like pro and above,
[3529.58 → 3535.50] it's probably going to go into a chassis where there's more than enough space between where the board sits and where the hard drive keys are.
[3535.72 → 3536.94] But you can't always count on that.
[3536.94 → 3537.26] Right.
[3537.48 → 3537.88] Yeah.
[3537.88 → 3541.38] But that's the hard part, right, is that we kind of have to balance that out.
[3541.82 → 3544.94] So I think for me, I'd rather do kind of the Q connector kind of thing.
[3545.00 → 3546.34] I think people would be okay with that.
[3547.02 → 3553.14] So I think that's probably the direction we're moving closer towards than seeing the USB 3 header actually go right angle.
[3553.32 → 3559.76] And there is also a little bit, there is a little bit of actually signal integrity issues that when you turn it actually to the right angle,
[3560.42 → 3564.08] that you can actually change a little bit of some of the layout topology and stuff like that.
[3564.08 → 3567.60] And since we don't want to have to go rework the entire board from that perspective,
[3568.10 → 3571.22] you know, it makes a little bit more sense to save the work that we've already done.
[3571.22 → 3572.44] Okay.
[3572.44 → 3574.66] So let's talk Devil's Canyon.
[3575.22 → 3580.80] Are we going to see, I mean, I already know the answer to this, but this is a question from Fabian.
[3581.38 → 3586.44] Are we going to see Devil's Canyon CPUs work on your Z97 boards?
[3586.54 → 3589.44] Are we going to see them work on your Z87 boards?
[3589.44 → 3592.02] So this is a tricky topic.
[3592.52 → 3596.14] So I'll give you guys as much information as I can on this point.
[3596.28 → 3596.38] Sure.
[3597.46 → 3601.44] Intel requires what's called MEI compliance for certain CPUs.
[3602.36 → 3605.16] So there is, you guys kind of know the option ROM, right?
[3605.18 → 3609.30] The option ROM on a serial ATA controller, like on the Intel motherboards, right?
[3609.32 → 3611.32] So that's like the firmware for the SATA controller.
[3611.50 → 3614.60] And sometimes when new chipsets come out, there's actually new option ROM, right?
[3614.90 → 3615.54] Well, the same thing.
[3615.54 → 3620.12] When a new chipset comes out, there's new MEI firmware generally corresponding to that CPU.
[3620.74 → 3627.88] So technically to support the new Devil's Canyon CPUs, you have to, excuse me, you have to be running the new MEI firmware.
[3628.04 → 3630.28] So I believe it's 9.1 MEI firmware.
[3630.60 → 3632.86] So all Z97 motherboards have that.
[3633.26 → 3637.36] But for Z87, they're running on an older MEI firmware.
[3637.64 → 3641.92] So you will actually have to backport that MEI firmware blocked to those boards.
[3641.92 → 3644.12] Now we've done some internal testing already.
[3644.12 → 3648.18] And we have been able to actually backport this.
[3648.46 → 3656.36] But as to, you know, what the timeframe may be for us to formally roll this out or whether we will formally roll that out, I can't state that at this time.
[3656.44 → 3664.58] We're still evaluating because there's also a concern that we talked about this, I think, last time with AMD, where there's always a little bit of trickiness.
[3664.58 → 3676.90] When you backport new CPUs to an older chipset, and you make the UEFI or the BIOS compatible for that, you don't want it to break the overall performance or the interoperability compatibility for the old CPU platform.
[3677.46 → 3677.52] Right.
[3677.52 → 3682.92] Because we have to overall favour the majority of people that have the old CPU versus the new CPU.
[3683.04 → 3687.14] Because most users, I mean, statistically on that old chipset, aren't going to upgrade to a new CPU.
[3687.44 → 3694.76] But they may go out there, and they may download that new UEFI at 4.6 or 4.7.
[3694.76 → 3700.80] And it maybe brings down their overhead a little bit because, you know, there's different code base and different that running around in there.
[3701.06 → 3701.98] We try not to do that.
[3702.04 → 3708.02] So our rule of thumb is we try to keep the performance for the previous CPU the same or within a 5% margin.
[3708.02 → 3711.10] If it doesn't adhere to that, then it's something that we might not do.
[3711.22 → 3712.34] And then there's also still use.
[3712.72 → 3715.06] There is also resource limitations and things like that.
[3715.10 → 3720.04] As you guys know, there's another chipset that I can't talk about, but it's coming down later down the pipe.
[3720.14 → 3721.94] So this is all just about a managed resource.
[3721.94 → 3724.48] But I think our track record has been pretty good in this regard.
[3724.66 → 3730.80] So as soon as I have more information on what will happen specifically for Z87, you guys will definitely know.
[3730.90 → 3733.72] I will make sure to let you guys know as far as how that works out.
[3734.10 → 3738.42] But right now, guaranteed, 100% support is exclusive to Z97.
[3738.86 → 3739.40] All right.
[3739.44 → 3745.24] So what I'd like to do is, guys, we're going to thank everyone for sending in their Q&A questions for JJ.
[3745.48 → 3746.90] Thanks, JJ, for answering them.
[3746.90 → 3747.50] But hold on.
[3747.80 → 3751.90] I'm not quite done with you yet, JJ, because I'd love for you to hang around with us for one more.
[3751.94 → 3752.80] More topic.
[3752.92 → 3753.92] That isn't a Q&A.
[3754.16 → 3758.26] But this is something that I have personally bitched to you about.
[3758.72 → 3761.96] And now I may be getting my way.
[3762.04 → 3762.98] I'm extremely excited.
[3763.20 → 3776.94] And I would love to hear your thoughts on the rumour that Intel's upcoming Eons, including some pretty crazy, like, 18-core SKUs, may be unlocked.
[3776.94 → 3784.88] Or even water-cooling optimized, which has implications that I'm sure are fairly obvious to you for enthusiasts.
[3785.96 → 3787.94] And this was posted originally on the forum by Luca...
[3787.94 → 3789.90] He doesn't look like he wants to answer.
[3789.92 → 3790.60] Luca P.
[3790.60 → 3792.60] So, let's...
[3792.60 → 3795.14] Oh, yeah.
[3795.22 → 3797.96] And the original article was from hardwarebot.org.
[3800.36 → 3801.54] Sounds interesting to me.
[3801.60 → 3802.74] That's about all I can say.
[3804.42 → 3805.46] Oh, come on!
[3805.46 → 3808.76] I wasn't expecting more than that, to be honest.
[3809.96 → 3811.24] Sounds interesting to me.
[3811.44 → 3814.42] You know, but I will preface this.
[3814.80 → 3815.72] I will preface this.
[3816.38 → 3820.42] There are always a lot of interesting things that comes about on the internet, as you guys know.
[3820.50 → 3825.22] And your guys' forums is a hotbed for a lot of this stuff circulating around and people discussing it.
[3825.78 → 3825.96] No.
[3826.62 → 3827.44] Not at all.
[3827.44 → 3831.82] And, you know, some of it is sometimes true and some of it's not true, you know.
[3831.92 → 3840.84] But even around, like, the upcoming Devil's Canyon, there's been a lot of supposed communication and validation at what people perceive to be truths that were existing before in the community.
[3841.24 → 3848.30] And they think that all of a sudden there's been changes that all of a sudden have somehow aligned with these truths that they think existed about older CPUs.
[3848.52 → 3854.76] And are going to be all of a sudden, I guess, proven true for the refresh-based CPUs.
[3854.76 → 3858.70] And, you know, all things will come in time as far as you'll see the way things work out.
[3859.14 → 3861.92] But, you know, like it is, all things will come in time, right?
[3862.08 → 3863.44] That didn't sound like a denial.
[3864.24 → 3865.46] You know, I can't.
[3865.50 → 3866.88] Like I said, I wish I could say more.
[3867.42 → 3870.16] But I just have to keep it tuned, right?
[3870.30 → 3870.56] You know.
[3870.64 → 3878.02] And I'm sure the moment that something is confirmed and validated, they're going to find out from you guys because you guys are great about giving everybody that information.
[3879.32 → 3879.86] All right.
[3879.86 → 3881.00] Well, I'll tell you what, JJ.
[3881.00 → 3886.46] JJ, without you having to confirm or deny anything, first, thank you very much for coming on the show.
[3886.54 → 3888.46] It was an absolute pleasure to have you on again.
[3888.80 → 3899.54] And second of all, just like, okay, just like the conversation I had with NVIDIA where I was swapping emails with my PR contact at like 3 in the morning.
[3899.54 → 3905.26] Whereas I said, out of the blue, I'm just like, you know, Shield 2 rumours are starting to float around.
[3905.54 → 3907.82] And, you know, we're hearing screen resolution this.
[3907.90 → 3908.72] We're hearing that.
[3909.06 → 3912.46] Obviously, the CPUs are the GPU, whatever you want to call it.
[3912.92 → 3915.48] I could really piss NVIDIA off and call it an APU.
[3917.90 → 3920.08] Obviously, that's been pretty much ready for a while.
[3920.08 → 3922.40] So, I sent this email.
[3922.54 → 3925.92] I'm like, hey, make sure I'm on the top of the list for a Shield 2.
[3926.12 → 3927.62] And he just sends back, lol.
[3928.26 → 3930.38] But that was all the response I needed.
[3930.60 → 3931.80] I just made sure you heard me.
[3932.08 → 3939.92] JJ, man, make sure that if any of this enthusiast grade, multicore, overclocking, unlock stuff happens,
[3940.04 → 3945.02] whatever board you guys have that is the very best one, whether that's a WS or whatever else,
[3945.30 → 3947.76] please make sure that I'm on the top of the list.
[3948.02 → 3948.82] Top of the list, man.
[3948.82 → 3950.86] You guys are always on the top of my list.
[3951.04 → 3951.68] You guys are great.
[3951.68 → 3951.88] Thank you.
[3952.70 → 3953.62] We always try to work with this.
[3953.62 → 3956.96] Should we all, like, kind of hug and kiss before we say bye here?
[3956.98 → 3957.82] Well, we need two.
[3957.90 → 3958.98] I'm not even trying to get one.
[3959.16 → 3959.72] We need two.
[3959.72 → 3960.16] It's all good.
[3960.26 → 3962.28] You know, we got a healthy bromance going on.
[3962.32 → 3962.84] It's all right.
[3962.96 → 3964.48] You know, I think we're all comfortable here.
[3964.94 → 3965.62] Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[3965.80 → 3969.12] You got to get us two of those boards if they exist because he's going to steal one.
[3969.24 → 3970.86] And I need to benchmark it.
[3970.94 → 3972.34] I don't even care personally.
[3972.94 → 3974.36] I cannot take it home.
[3974.42 → 3974.88] That's fine.
[3975.00 → 3976.30] He's going to take it home.
[3976.38 → 3977.92] So, I need another one for testing.
[3977.92 → 3979.78] You know, I will give you one thing.
[3980.12 → 3985.20] It's something I actually – I wrote about it on the PC DIY site that I handled the comfit for.
[3985.82 → 3987.46] But I think it's, like, a little bit of lone fact.
[3987.56 → 3989.66] I don't know if you guys already kind of found out about it.
[3989.66 → 3996.34] But since I couldn't give you a confirmation or deny about what you guys asked about, a lot of people have been asking about the Swift.
[3996.92 → 4002.28] One of the really cool things I can tell you for the Swift is, you know, the Swift – you guys know all the new specs it will have.
[4002.34 → 4008.02] But one of the new functions it will also be – it will be the first 3D Vision 2560-enabled panel.
[4008.02 → 4011.86] So, you'll be able to game and actually add 3D resolutions beyond 1080.
[4012.06 → 4014.50] So, that's at least something maybe you guys didn't know about.
[4014.56 → 4014.92] Kind of cool.
[4015.36 → 4016.18] I did not.
[4016.76 → 4016.96] No.
[4018.00 → 4019.06] I don't like 3D.
[4019.22 → 4021.24] I know you don't like 3D, but some people do.
[4021.64 → 4025.62] And you haven't tried it with a low-persistence backlight monitor, have you?
[4025.62 → 4026.00] That's true.
[4026.12 → 4026.50] No, I haven't.
[4026.72 → 4028.48] So, this could be very interesting.
[4028.48 → 4029.82] I've tried the light boost hack, though.
[4029.82 → 4030.40] All right.
[4030.50 → 4031.90] So, thank you very much, JJ.
[4032.32 → 4042.52] And we will hopefully have you on again, I guess, in another year when another – oh, no, because we're going to – you can neither confirm nor deny that we're going to have another chipset sooner than that.
[4042.76 → 4042.90] Right.
[4043.62 → 4047.82] But why don't we all agree that we're going to reconvene sooner than a year from now?
[4048.40 → 4051.36] Yeah, I definitely will say sooner than a year from now we can reconvene.
[4051.36 → 4059.34] And if any of your guys have any questions that they want answered that I didn't answer, you can tell them.
[4059.38 → 4060.16] They can post in the forum.
[4060.32 → 4064.68] I'll jump back in there a little bit later tonight, and I'll be more than happy to answer anybody's questions.
[4064.96 → 4065.76] That's fantastic.
[4065.96 → 4066.20] All right.
[4066.26 → 4066.80] Thanks, JJ.
[4067.34 → 4070.18] And thanks to all of our viewers.
[4070.36 → 4077.10] If you guys want to just let JJ know, give him a big old, you know, thanks, JJ, in the Twitch chat or on Twitter or whatever else.
[4077.12 → 4078.66] I'm sure he'll want to check that out.
[4078.66 → 4084.88] But now it is time to cover our sponsors for the day.
[4085.40 → 4088.10] So first up, we've got Squarespace.
[4088.40 → 4091.26] Now, they asked us to do something a little bit different.
[4091.50 → 4098.78] So normally we would say, okay, Squarespace is the beautiful way to create your own very own awesome, fantastic website.
[4099.16 → 4101.50] And it's, you know, relatively inexpensive.
[4101.90 → 4102.98] Actually, it's quite inexpensive.
[4103.18 → 4104.28] They have 24-7 support.
[4104.38 → 4106.22] Okay, all that stuff that I normally say.
[4106.22 → 4110.96] This time, they actually asked me for something very, very different.
[4111.60 → 4113.44] And I'm going to go ahead.
[4113.54 → 4117.44] I'm going to play this here song that is known as...
[4117.44 → 4118.60] I'm not going to be able to hear it.
[4118.76 → 4119.22] I have it.
[4119.90 → 4120.12] What?
[4120.42 → 4121.08] You can hear it.
[4121.90 → 4125.02] That is known as the Squarespace jingle.
[4125.02 → 4130.88] Also, there might be some lip-syncing going on in the corner up here.
[4133.56 → 4134.46] Oh, it's muted.
[4135.12 → 4136.34] How dare you be muted.
[4137.22 → 4139.18] This is the song-a-day guy, by the way.
[4139.66 → 4140.02] Here we go.
[4140.06 → 4140.38] Here we go.
[4140.42 → 4140.74] Here we go.
[4140.78 → 4141.10] Here we go.
[4141.16 → 4141.48] Here we go.
[4141.80 → 4142.10] All right.
[4142.16 → 4142.36] Okay.
[4142.46 → 4142.70] Okay.
[4142.88 → 4144.34] We got the lyrics to it.
[4144.34 → 4149.28] It's the all-in-one platform.

[4160.20 → 4162.46] or online portfolio.

[4168.16 → 4168.18] Wow.
[4168.64 → 4169.86] You know the drill.
[4169.98 → 4171.24] You know where to go.
[4171.24 → 4173.94] Squarespace gets started today.
[4174.16 → 4176.60] Make the website that you want to make.
[4176.88 → 4179.34] Squarespace so easy and fast.
[4179.64 → 4181.76] They can fund all your favourite podcasts.
[4182.32 → 4187.58] They fund all your favourite podcasts to start your retry.

[4195.94 → 4200.94] All the options you need to create a unique.
[4201.24 → 4201.92] Website.
[4202.02 → 4203.62] They're constantly improving.
[4204.32 → 4206.56] The platform and the tools.
[4207.24 → 4208.24] And it's awesome.
[4208.72 → 4209.10] There you go.
[4209.20 → 4211.24] Squarespace gets started today.
[4211.32 → 4213.96] Make the website that you want to make.
[4214.26 → 4216.66] Squarespace so easy and fast.
[4216.96 → 4219.04] They fund all your favourite podcasts.
[4219.64 → 4222.66] They fund all your favourite podcasts.
[4222.66 → 4231.44] And that, my friends, is the Squarespace song.
[4231.68 → 4237.20] And they sent this over to me, and I was like, yeah, okay, we can play this on the show.
[4237.28 → 4241.74] But I tell you what, guys, there is no way that we can take this seriously because even
[4241.74 → 4247.94] though the song legit actually contains all the key selling points of Squarespace, it's
[4247.94 → 4253.18] just, it's like, it's not a serious song by any stretch of the imagination.
[4253.46 → 4259.20] So, guys, the point of this is not necessarily to listen to it and kind of go, oh, now I completely
[4259.20 → 4259.92] understand Squarespace.
[4259.92 → 4265.24] The point, more than anything else, is to go, look, this is a fun way to get the word
[4265.24 → 4266.24] out there about Squarespace.
[4266.62 → 4274.24] And most importantly, a fun way to talk about how Squarespace funds some pretty awesome podcasts,
[4274.48 → 4275.64] including ours.
[4276.04 → 4281.68] And it's a big reason that we are actually able to exist and able to do this kind of thing.
[4281.68 → 4287.18] And that, that was the whole thing in the chorus about we fund all your favourite podcasts because
[4287.18 → 4292.28] they're very proud of their role in supporting the podcast community, something that a lot
[4292.28 → 4298.16] of other companies are just not that interested in because the ROI is very difficult to measure.
[4298.30 → 4303.66] So, guys, just remember, you want to make your own beautiful website, head over to squarespace.com
[4303.66 → 4309.44] slash Linus for a free trial and 10% off gets, or you get 10% off with offer code Linus.
[4309.76 → 4310.22] There we go.
[4310.22 → 4313.86] Not my most, not my most graceful, graceful read ever.
[4314.04 → 4321.04] But speaking of graceful and perfect segues that couldn't be any better no matter what
[4321.04 → 4326.20] happened, Modes is a new sponsor of the WAN show.
[4326.38 → 4331.46] And you guys all need to, like legitimately, if you have a Facebook account, and I know not
[4331.46 → 4336.86] all of you are going to, but you are going to want to head over to Facebook and head over
[4336.86 → 4338.86] to the Modes page.
[4338.86 → 4341.08] So that's M-O-D-I-S.
[4341.42 → 4345.56] Because Geek stakes is going on right now, you guys.
[4345.72 → 4351.10] And Geek stakes is, was actually a collaborative thing that we worked on.
[4351.28 → 4353.18] Austin Evans has been involved.
[4353.72 → 4357.08] And it is basically a bunch of crazy awesome prizes.
[4357.08 → 4360.72] Hey guys, it's Geek stakes 2014.
[4360.72 → 4366.80] No, but seriously, we helped pick all the prizes because they asked us for some insight into
[4366.80 → 4369.46] what our audience would want them to give away.
[4369.72 → 4371.74] So here, I'm just going to screen share really quick here.
[4372.14 → 4372.92] So there you go.
[4373.04 → 4375.00] It's Facebook.com slash Modes.
[4375.00 → 4377.24] So Modes is an IT recruiter.
[4377.34 → 4381.48] So not only do they give away a bunch of cool stuff, but you can submit your resume to them
[4381.48 → 4382.04] for free.
[4382.04 → 4388.84] And they handle placements to Fortune 500 companies, little tiny startups, and all throughout the
[4388.84 → 4389.48] IT industry.
[4389.48 → 4394.46] It's a way of getting a job with the IT industry that, quite frankly, I had never actually considered.
[4394.46 → 4396.68] I'd heard of it.
[4397.22 → 4399.34] So it costs nothing for the actual user.
[4399.98 → 4404.48] And major, like big companies, they asked me not to name any names, but big companies
[4404.48 → 4408.38] use these guys to fill some seriously cool positions.
[4408.38 → 4411.10] I'm sure if you're one of the people that want to sign up for this, your Google foo is
[4411.10 → 4412.98] probably good enough to kind of figure that out.
[4413.06 → 4413.16] Yeah.
[4413.26 → 4416.68] So anyway, guys, the Geek stakes runs from May 23rd to June 6th.
[4416.68 → 4419.54] And if you go back every day, you can get additional entries.
[4419.72 → 4423.98] I do want to talk a little bit about what they are giving away.
[4423.98 → 4426.42] So there's an MSI GS60.
[4426.68 → 4428.98] That was my personal contribution.
[4429.12 → 4434.16] I was like, okay, look, you guys, whatever other prizes you got, like that's cool.
[4434.42 → 4435.06] That's cool.
[4435.18 → 4437.94] But you want to make sure you've got like a sweet gaming notebook.
[4438.22 → 4443.10] And that was one that was able to fit into the price that we were able to kind of take
[4443.10 → 4445.10] away from everything else and be able to hit.
[4445.28 → 4447.66] They are giving away an Oculus Rift.
[4448.04 → 4453.96] They are giving away a Parrot AR drone, a Litre camera, that camera that you can,
[4453.98 → 4455.86] focus after you take the picture.
[4456.04 → 4456.24] Right, right.
[4456.24 → 4461.10] They're giving away a Fire TV, a Sphere, that Bluetooth control ball, Pebble smartwatch.
[4461.28 → 4462.86] That was my personal contribution as well.
[4463.22 → 4466.02] A Jaybird Blue Buds X Bluetooth earbud set.
[4466.98 → 4469.92] Almost everything on this list is stuff we've reviewed in the past.
[4470.04 → 4470.20] Yeah.
[4470.20 → 4474.18] They're giving away an M45 gaming mouse, my personal favourite gaming mouse right now.
[4474.28 → 4477.82] So guys, definitely go and check that out.
[4477.98 → 4480.70] Which brings us into our last sponsor.
[4481.26 → 4486.34] Guys, if you haven't had enough Asus on this show already, what on earth are you doing?
[4486.42 → 4486.74] You know what?
[4486.78 → 4491.80] Just go back to the standard one because we've got our Asus DOG notebook right there.
[4491.80 → 4495.80] If you haven't had enough Asus on this show, I'm going to drink some Asus Kool-Aid here
[4495.80 → 4498.80] some more and talk to you guys about the G750JZ.
[4499.86 → 4501.62] I don't think we have any other Asus things.
[4502.40 → 4502.72] Okay.
[4503.44 → 4504.10] Oh, it's Monday.
[4504.22 → 4507.10] So I was doing the WAN show and I brought a laptop.
[4507.48 → 4512.78] I thought that I would rap, but you didn't give a crap top about my rhymes that just ain't
[4512.78 → 4513.50] that great.
[4513.62 → 4516.80] But on the show, it's my show, so don't hate.
[4517.36 → 4518.12] Oh my God.
[4518.16 → 4519.02] You prepped that, didn't you?
[4519.02 → 4519.90] No, I actually didn't.
[4520.00 → 4520.24] Really?
[4520.44 → 4521.40] That was 100% freestyle.
[4521.52 → 4522.30] That was pretty good.
[4522.48 → 4524.30] I've freestyled better on the show before.
[4524.40 → 4529.82] But anyway, the point, guys, is the G750JZ is a legit power gaming notebook.
[4529.96 → 4530.56] Legit power?
[4530.66 → 4531.82] Legit powerful gaming notebook.
[4532.10 → 4533.18] I'm never going to make it through.
[4534.38 → 4535.26] Legit power.
[4535.38 → 4536.76] That should be their new tagline.
[4536.90 → 4537.30] It's funny.
[4537.30 → 4537.82] Rock solid.
[4538.04 → 4538.88] Legit power.
[4540.54 → 4543.80] The saddest part is I don't even think it's impossible.
[4544.26 → 4544.40] No.
[4545.30 → 4546.54] Can't even power.
[4546.54 → 4547.22] Legit.
[4547.56 → 4549.80] Literally can't even power.
[4550.76 → 4551.16] Okay.
[4551.30 → 4557.66] So anyway, the point is, it's funny, because with these, the way we talk about the G750JZ,
[4557.82 → 4561.38] like we eventually laboriously get the point across.
[4562.08 → 4566.08] But if I was ASUS, I'd be like, what are these guys doing over there?
[4566.08 → 4570.84] But truthfully, and this is just, this is like the biggest tease ever, because I'm not
[4570.84 → 4572.34] going to tell you guys anything about it.
[4572.62 → 4576.40] ASUS just signed on with us for something really exciting.
[4576.56 → 4581.34] It's a collaborative effort between me and Logan and some other guys, potentially.
[4581.68 → 4584.26] And they are going to be our presenting sponsor for it.
[4584.26 → 4588.06] We're going to be talking about, potentially, another cool ASUS gaming laptop.
[4588.06 → 4593.08] And it is going to be absolutely, like, bat crap crazy.
[4593.32 → 4595.04] Expect that to happen around the end of June.
[4595.10 → 4601.14] But in the meantime, G750JZ is what I would consider to be about as good as it gets for
[4601.14 → 4605.54] a desktop replacement without getting into that unreasonable size, where it just doesn't
[4605.54 → 4608.22] really make any sense anymore, and the battery life isn't that good.
[4608.22 → 4614.10] Like, with the, with the 750JZ, I can get through almost two full WAN shows on one charge, in
[4614.10 → 4618.96] spite of the fact that it is a gaming notebook, and if I am gaming, obviously battery life's
[4618.96 → 4624.02] not as good, but I can get performance that is pretty close to what you could do on a modern
[4624.02 → 4627.98] generation desktop, and actually probably about the same as what you could do on a last
[4627.98 → 4630.78] gen high performance gaming desktop with a single GPU.
[4631.32 → 4632.38] Enthusiast grade GPU.
[4632.64 → 4633.40] You know what we should do?
[4633.90 → 4636.44] You know how we make like tech quickie commercials for different companies every once in a while?
[4636.44 → 4636.78] Well, hold on.
[4636.86 → 4640.88] So, thanks ASUS for sponsoring the WAN show and providing us with these awesome laptops
[4640.88 → 4642.80] to use while we broadcast to you guys.
[4642.88 → 4644.02] It's like, pretty cool of them.
[4644.28 → 4646.46] It's nice, considering my last one barely works anymore.
[4647.88 → 4653.32] We should make a like, tech quickie-style commercial thing for Jay-Z laptops, but we should
[4653.32 → 4657.12] make it where it's a rap battle featuring Linus.
[4657.12 → 4662.92] And Linus has to, like, go through these, it's kind of like the Pokémon League, but in rap
[4662.92 → 4663.50] battle form.
[4663.50 → 4668.42] So you have to, like, beat all these different rap battle trainer people, and they all have,
[4668.42 → 4671.26] like, different styles, and you have to make your way through it, and then when you win,
[4671.34 → 4672.28] you get a Jay-Z laptop.
[4673.16 → 4673.52] Okay.
[4673.96 → 4675.06] Oh, hey, guys.
[4675.16 → 4675.70] Oh, sorry.
[4675.96 → 4676.66] Sorry, sorry.
[4676.72 → 4677.74] Totally, totally off-topic.
[4677.86 → 4679.94] I've got our...
[4679.94 → 4680.56] What on earth?
[4680.62 → 4681.00] Where is it?
[4681.04 → 4682.10] Okay, well, okay, anyway.
[4682.74 → 4685.58] Back to the Modes giveaway really quickly here.
[4685.66 → 4686.28] Just screen share me.
[4686.28 → 4689.92] Um, the first draw is in half an hour.
[4690.52 → 4693.68] So guys, seriously, legitimately, go check it out.
[4693.94 → 4697.16] Go like the page right now, and you'll be entered to win a stick and find.
[4697.26 → 4701.46] So that's that little Bluetooth sticker that Luke and I used for that fun little video we
[4701.46 → 4702.84] did where we played hide the sausage.
[4703.38 → 4708.14] So guys, seriously, like, just go there now and go click it, because otherwise, um, I will
[4708.14 → 4713.30] have to eat gruel for several weeks, and I don't think you would want that.
[4713.30 → 4714.70] Twitch chat liked my idea.
[4715.30 → 4716.04] What was your idea?
[4716.10 → 4716.86] Oh, I hate your idea.
[4716.96 → 4718.34] Your idea is stupid.
[4718.50 → 4718.64] Why?
[4719.40 → 4721.78] Your idea is bad, and you should feel bad.
[4721.82 → 4722.90] I want to see you rap battle.
[4723.50 → 4724.62] You want to see me rap battle?
[4724.74 → 4724.94] Yeah.
[4725.22 → 4725.72] Do you?
[4726.00 → 4726.94] Yeah, I do, actually.
[4727.08 → 4727.64] Oh, boy.
[4728.86 → 4731.86] And yet, you don't want to make a foot flick music video.
[4732.28 → 4733.34] Okay, okay.
[4733.68 → 4737.92] So last show, you guys, I brought up the foot flick thing, about how every nerd knows how
[4737.92 → 4740.98] to do the foot flick so they don't yank Ethernet cables and destroy devices.
[4741.34 → 4746.78] So I was saying we should do, like, a really quick kind of tech tips video on, like, everyone
[4746.78 → 4748.20] should know how to do the foot flick.
[4748.30 → 4749.32] This is how you do the foot flick.
[4749.64 → 4754.20] And his reaction was, awesome, but let's make it a music video.
[4755.16 → 4756.00] Do the foot flick.
[4756.56 → 4758.10] Oh, oh, do the foot flick.
[4758.60 → 4759.26] Oh, oh.
[4759.26 → 4761.06] So we're making, like, new dance moves.
[4761.36 → 4765.12] But part of the foot flick is you've got to flick your foot back so hard that you fall forward.
[4765.22 → 4765.42] Yeah.
[4765.62 → 4767.32] So the whole thing's going to have to be, like, this.
[4767.32 → 4769.66] Yeah, it couldn't be the same person every time.
[4769.96 → 4770.04] No.
[4770.04 → 4775.46] Like, the idea is that, like, we'd have, like, one cable during the chorus, and, like, one
[4775.46 → 4779.24] person would walk by and, like, do the foot flick, and they'd, like, roll past it.
[4779.28 → 4781.28] And then, like, the next person comes by, do the foot flick.
[4781.46 → 4783.66] And if you can't do the foot flick, you're going to be in trouble.
[4783.92 → 4785.94] You're going to be on the ground on the double.
[4786.20 → 4787.28] And then, like, someone falls.
[4787.44 → 4789.06] See, I would love to see you in a rap battle.
[4789.52 → 4790.44] I think you could do it.
[4791.34 → 4792.36] Oh, I love it.
[4792.66 → 4793.86] I definitely think you could do it.
[4794.14 → 4795.46] So are we, yeah, I don't know.
[4795.46 → 4797.02] We've got to do something with the foot flick.
[4797.58 → 4797.90] Okay.
[4798.06 → 4798.30] Okay.
[4798.30 → 4799.04] Whatever it ends up being.
[4799.96 → 4802.24] We will do something with the foot flick.
[4802.40 → 4808.50] I cannot promise nor threaten that it will be a rap battle or a music video, but it will
[4808.50 → 4809.52] definitely be something.
[4810.20 → 4810.52] All right.
[4810.52 → 4813.78] Speaking of things that are definitely something, this is cool.
[4813.90 → 4821.72] I mean, we don't often just find, you know, like, a little small PC announcement and sort
[4821.72 → 4825.32] of make a big deal about it on the WAN show, unless it's a product that we think is, like,
[4825.70 → 4826.84] really, really different.
[4827.12 → 4830.38] And this is still just an all-in-one mini PC.
[4830.48 → 4831.38] Or not all-in-one, pardon me.
[4831.68 → 4833.10] It's still just a mini PC.
[4833.10 → 4834.50] But look at it.
[4835.42 → 4838.08] This is the Z-Box Sphere.
[4838.98 → 4841.82] And what it is, is it is a tiny PC.
[4842.22 → 4845.74] Like, it's, okay, this isn't giving you guys much of an idea of the scale here.
[4845.80 → 4849.16] So this was posted on the forum by 4960X.
[4849.72 → 4855.72] Seriously, people who put, like, years in their usernames or, like, individual products in their
[4855.72 → 4859.14] usernames, you guys got to forward think a little bit more.
[4859.14 → 4861.02] Anyway, it's about this big.
[4861.08 → 4862.48] I saw it first at CES.
[4862.62 → 4867.54] But this thing's got a Core i5 processor in it and is a full computer in the size of a
[4867.54 → 4867.82] sphere.
[4868.02 → 4868.78] And you know what?
[4869.80 → 4871.72] They deserve some attention for this.
[4871.98 → 4874.64] For trying to think, literally, outside the box.
[4874.82 → 4875.14] Oh.
[4877.50 → 4878.44] No, you don't want to do that.
[4878.44 → 4879.02] Oh, are you sweaty?
[4879.16 → 4879.78] It's nasty.
[4879.86 → 4880.00] Okay.
[4880.40 → 4884.84] Well, the point is, they're thinking outside the box in much the same way that Apple is
[4884.84 → 4886.10] getting so much attention for.
[4886.10 → 4890.54] But who else is going to pay attention to Total for doing something a little bit different
[4890.54 → 4891.64] other than us?
[4891.76 → 4893.88] So I've requested a review sample of that.
[4893.98 → 4895.62] I do want to tell you guys more about it.
[4895.68 → 4896.74] I think it's really cool.
[4897.14 → 4900.42] You basically twist off the top for tool-less upgrades.
[4900.54 → 4905.90] It takes a 2.5-inch SSD, an M-SATA SSD, and two SODIUM modules.
[4906.52 → 4909.40] And, yeah, I think that is pretty darn cool.
[4909.74 → 4911.86] Speaking of things that aren't pretty darn cool.
[4912.86 → 4913.80] Oh, yeah.
[4913.80 → 4915.48] What is, like, what?
[4916.00 → 4918.82] So this was posted on the forum by Niels Erik.
[4919.28 → 4921.84] And the original article is from tweakers.net.
[4922.06 → 4926.88] And, basically, Google sent out a letter that was discovered by the Wall Street Journal.
[4927.08 → 4928.56] Thank you, Wall Street Journal, for being cool.
[4929.06 → 4932.34] This letter was sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission back in December, arguing
[4932.34 → 4935.16] that they don't have to specify their revenues on mobile ads.
[4935.16 → 4944.26] And one of the arguments that they brought up is that it's difficult to indicate mobile devices
[4944.26 → 4946.28] because the definition keeps on changing.
[4946.66 → 4948.14] Like, it's difficult to pin down.
[4948.22 → 4949.68] What exactly is a mobile device?
[4949.68 → 4956.24] So they use possible future examples such as fridges, thermostats, glasses, and watches.
[4956.24 → 4967.48] But the problem here is that even though Google hasn't talked or even indicated that they have any plans of implementing ads on any of those kinds of devices,
[4968.76 → 4971.90] it shows that they're thinking about it.
[4971.90 → 4980.66] Like, how annoying would that be on something like a watch where you have such limited real estate where it's like...
[4980.66 → 4985.52] Or, okay, but let's move away from sort of the watches we have today and kind of go,
[4985.68 → 4989.10] okay, what about the watch of tomorrow where it has a holographic display or whatever else?
[4989.76 → 4993.58] Could we be looking at a situation where you, like, are expected to look past an ad?
[4993.88 → 4997.78] Or, like, if you look at it at the wrong angle, there's, like, an ad in your face?
[4997.78 → 4998.82] Like...
[4998.82 → 4999.46] Yeah, probably.
[4999.66 → 5002.82] And it's frustrating because this brings up the thing that we've talked about before, too,
[5002.88 → 5008.84] which is where you totally buy a device and then that person that you bought the device from serves you ads,
[5009.00 → 5010.26] which is crazy frustrating.
[5011.30 → 5012.62] Okay, speaking of...
[5012.62 → 5014.00] So, anyway, that's just...
[5014.00 → 5015.72] It was a very brief discussion topic there.
[5015.72 → 5022.40] Speaking of buying a device and then having the rug completely pulled out from under you,
[5022.82 → 5024.84] LG has...
[5024.84 → 5027.04] LG, guys, not cool.
[5027.04 → 5029.30] Like, not cool what's going on here.
[5029.66 → 5034.90] And as much as Noir's original post about this is super lame,
[5034.98 → 5039.74] it just says silly LG and then is a link to the original source here.
[5039.94 → 5042.22] That is not how we do things, Noir.
[5043.20 → 5047.10] Still, I actually am not sure what else I could have said about it.
[5047.14 → 5049.16] So, the original article is from techdirt.com.
[5049.16 → 5057.18] And basically, what happened is this gentleman didn't want to roll out an update to his two-year-old TV
[5057.18 → 5063.00] that would change the privacy policy in such a way that he wasn't comfortable with.
[5063.00 → 5064.00] So, what LG...
[5065.00 → 5065.44] Sorry?
[5065.44 → 5066.36] With good reason.
[5066.42 → 5067.24] With good reason.
[5067.76 → 5068.66] So, what LG...
[5068.66 → 5068.88] Oh, yeah.
[5068.96 → 5069.08] Okay.
[5069.14 → 5070.34] So, what it said was, yeah.
[5070.42 → 5073.90] When you use Live Plus, we may share certain viewing information, device information,
[5074.00 → 5078.56] and basic usage information with third parties for advertising and analytics purposes
[5078.56 → 5083.04] and enable the provision of information relevant to what you are viewing.
[5083.04 → 5089.68] To third party vendors that LG Electronics may engage to provide services on his behalf from time to time,
[5089.76 → 5092.86] such as to collect payment for content you purchase or to fulfill customer service requests
[5092.86 → 5094.32] or to provide advertising services.
[5095.16 → 5098.28] So, basically, the guy was like, yeah, no, that's not cool.
[5098.72 → 5102.38] So, LG basically goes, okay, well, you can either accept it
[5102.38 → 5108.44] or you cannot use the smart TV features of your smart TV that you bought.
[5108.64 → 5112.54] And it's not like he can just take it back to the store at this point to two-year-old TV.
[5112.54 → 5113.78] That's about it from Costco.
[5113.92 → 5116.40] Even Costco doesn't take back two-year-old TVs anymore.
[5116.60 → 5117.84] I think it's a three-month limit now.
[5118.06 → 5118.32] Wow.
[5120.14 → 5126.34] I can't even begin to understand how they feel like this is okay.
[5126.66 → 5127.52] I mean, it's...
[5127.52 → 5130.04] And they definitely do because it's very plainly written.
[5130.48 → 5130.76] Yes.
[5131.38 → 5132.20] That's going to happen.
[5132.20 → 5138.48] It's part of their policy that they can just not, if you refuse to accept the usage changes.
[5138.82 → 5139.38] And you know what?
[5139.38 → 5145.12] They're not the only ones who have covered their butts in such a way that, you know,
[5145.16 → 5148.54] they could just change anything at any time, and you would just have to deal with it.
[5148.82 → 5152.24] I just feel like, guys, when we hear about things like this,
[5152.44 → 5159.16] we have a responsibility to not support the guys who are, if nothing else,
[5159.66 → 5162.66] even if everyone has this as part of their policy,
[5162.66 → 5165.62] we can choose not to support the ones that are enforcing it.
[5165.94 → 5170.64] And at least make the ones that aren't enforcing it kind of look at what's going on and go,
[5170.74 → 5171.66] oh, okay, well...
[5172.18 → 5173.60] Let's keep not enforcing this.
[5173.60 → 5174.74] Let's keep not enforcing that.
[5174.80 → 5180.08] Because otherwise, we are going to back ourselves into a corner where we are just going to have no choice
[5180.08 → 5181.40] and we're not going to have another option.
[5181.40 → 5186.36] I've never really been interested in smart TVs because I find that, honestly, most of them are junk anyway.
[5186.82 → 5187.76] They truly are.
[5188.18 → 5190.40] So I wouldn't have bought one anyway,
[5190.58 → 5195.10] but this makes it so that if I had to, I would specifically not buy an LG one.
[5195.66 → 5197.48] Because, again, we have to try and vote with our wallets.
[5197.52 → 5202.50] It rarely seems to work, but if we can try again, that would be fantastic.
[5203.08 → 5205.60] Yeah, if we could just try that again...
[5205.60 → 5206.40] That would be great.
[5206.40 → 5207.06] That would be great.
[5207.80 → 5208.24] Thanks.
[5208.24 → 5212.56] All right, so big news this week.
[5212.96 → 5215.08] And I would love for you guys to...
[5215.08 → 5217.28] Let's do just a general Twitter Blitz Q&A.
[5217.36 → 5218.78] We're getting pretty close to the end of the show.
[5219.30 → 5221.18] And if you could specifically let me know,
[5221.24 → 5226.10] because I have zero marketing support from Microsoft.
[5226.52 → 5229.40] I don't know a single person in PR or their PR firm.
[5229.74 → 5234.76] So for me to review the Surface 3, I'm going to straight up have to buy it.
[5234.76 → 5237.94] So if you guys can let me know, like, are you...
[5237.94 → 5239.86] Because I don't need another laptop.
[5240.54 → 5242.14] Got the G750JZ, yo.
[5242.56 → 5244.62] Anyway, I don't need another laptop.
[5244.98 → 5248.20] So if someone is like, yeah, I would totally buy that off you, Linus,
[5248.24 → 5250.12] without you having to take a huge hit on it.
[5250.58 → 5254.80] Or if you guys are like, look, this is totally worth the $1,200 or so dollars
[5254.80 → 5258.10] you're going to have to spend on a medium spec one to really...
[5258.10 → 5259.24] Yeah, I know, it's a lot of money.
[5259.24 → 5261.36] And we really need you to review this.
[5261.44 → 5262.78] We really need you to talk about this.
[5262.84 → 5264.60] Guys, let me know how important this is to you.
[5265.04 → 5266.60] But basically, here it is.
[5266.90 → 5268.52] The Verge was at the launch event.
[5268.64 → 5270.20] They've got some pictures of it here.
[5270.52 → 5273.96] And this looks like what I pretty much asked for
[5273.96 → 5277.48] back when they launched the original Surface and the Surface RT.
[5277.88 → 5278.92] It is thinner.
[5279.52 → 5281.32] The keyboard implementation is better.
[5281.46 → 5283.92] So they've got a backlit type cover now
[5283.92 → 5287.10] that actually mounts to the screen differently.
[5287.26 → 5290.86] So you can actually fold it up flat and then lay it against it
[5290.86 → 5293.10] so that it angles up a little bit at the same time.
[5293.74 → 5296.32] The touchpad is bigger on the type cover.
[5296.64 → 5299.32] What they've effectively done is they've made it,
[5299.66 → 5302.70] well, the battery life is still not quite there.
[5302.78 → 5304.86] It's about eight hours, which is pretty good.
[5305.20 → 5308.06] But when you compare that to, what is it, 13 hours on the MacBook Air?
[5308.06 → 5314.10] Apple is like, ah, I want someone to beat them.
[5314.14 → 5315.78] Batteries are holding everything back everywhere.
[5315.94 → 5316.86] Batteries are holding everything back.
[5316.90 → 5320.50] So anyway, the point is they have pretty much delivered what I asked for
[5320.50 → 5322.10] when they first launched this device.
[5322.48 → 5325.72] A longer battery, great power consumption.
[5325.96 → 5326.60] It's thinner.
[5326.84 → 5327.76] It's beautiful.
[5327.96 → 5328.82] It's more functional.
[5329.12 → 5334.36] And it legitimately replaces both the tablet and the notebook
[5334.36 → 5336.46] in a way that the original just couldn't do
[5336.46 → 5339.60] because the changes they've made to the kickstand allow it,
[5339.80 → 5341.90] instead of just locking into a position or two,
[5342.38 → 5346.52] it uses a friction mount to go anywhere from 22 to 150 degrees.
[5346.86 → 5348.56] So you can sit the thing up in your lap
[5348.56 → 5351.70] and still have it be supported well enough that you can use it that way
[5351.70 → 5354.18] or you can lay it down flat and right on it
[5354.18 → 5361.02] with a 256 pressure layer or pressure level stylus.
[5361.62 → 5364.82] And you can really use it in every possible way.
[5364.82 → 5367.40] Apparently, the front-facing speakers sound great.
[5367.50 → 5370.64] This is a real drawback of many devices out there
[5370.64 → 5373.92] that I just feel like do a crappy job of implementing audio.
[5374.32 → 5377.66] And I'm glad to see someone other than HTC taking front-facing speakers
[5377.66 → 5379.12] and how important they are seriously.
[5379.92 → 5381.84] And honestly, guys, it's faster.
[5382.08 → 5384.70] It just looks like one seriously cool device.
[5384.80 → 5386.74] I really like that raise-up that you can do on the type cover.
[5386.74 → 5391.26] I hope it actually doesn't make it flex down a lot while you're typing
[5391.26 → 5392.74] because that would not be very good.
[5392.84 → 5393.12] I don't know.
[5393.16 → 5395.20] This is the kind of thing that I'd really like to...
[5395.20 → 5396.14] There's a close-up of the hinge.
[5396.24 → 5397.10] This is all from The Verge.
[5397.28 → 5400.06] This is how you can lay it all the way down flat pretty much
[5400.06 → 5401.26] so you can draw on it.
[5403.48 → 5404.70] It's really clean-looking,
[5404.96 → 5408.00] so that surface branding on the back of it is pretty much all you see.
[5408.00 → 5410.32] It apparently does get a little bit warm in use.
[5410.60 → 5413.34] I actually like this placement of the Windows button right here
[5413.34 → 5414.64] rather than the bottom one
[5414.64 → 5418.00] because when I sit and use a tablet or even a notebook,
[5418.30 → 5421.96] I'm using my hands or a hand,
[5422.14 → 5428.08] and this is as good or better always than down here.
[5428.30 → 5429.04] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5429.28 → 5431.76] Where it's more of a like you grab something
[5431.76 → 5435.94] and you're liable to accidentally press it as often as press it on purpose.
[5435.94 → 5436.08] Right, yeah.
[5436.08 → 5440.44] So let's do that Twitter blitz, shall we, guys?
[5440.48 → 5441.28] We want to hear from you.
[5441.36 → 5441.92] I feel bad.
[5442.08 → 5444.76] I feel like we don't do enough Twitter interaction on this show anymore,
[5444.86 → 5447.48] but we just have so much stuff to talk about.
[5448.68 → 5449.70] Captain Cake says,
[5449.78 → 5451.06] Buy one, review it, and return it.
[5451.42 → 5452.74] Okay, that is a good suggestion,
[5453.00 → 5454.38] but there is an issue with that,
[5454.46 → 5456.58] and that's that if something goes wrong
[5456.58 → 5458.88] and we scratch it or something,
[5459.50 → 5461.70] then we're in a pretty bad situation.
[5462.56 → 5464.62] Someone says they would rather see us check out
[5464.62 → 5465.96] the Lenovo X1 Carbon.
[5466.10 → 5467.24] So that's from Ryan Jenkins.
[5467.84 → 5468.36] Greg says,
[5468.44 → 5469.14] It's really cool,
[5469.28 → 5471.40] but I don't think the audience would be interested enough.
[5471.50 → 5472.88] Well, that's the point of this Twitter blitz.
[5473.00 → 5475.66] Let's find out what the audience thinks about this.
[5475.84 → 5477.36] Speaking of the audience,
[5477.68 → 5480.00] there were a couple of things that I had in here
[5480.00 → 5484.12] that I wanted a straw poll.
[5484.12 → 5485.00] Okay, one straw poll.
[5485.10 → 5488.52] Luke, can you create a straw poll on the Infinite,
[5488.56 → 5491.14] so that was that omnidirectional treadmill we looked at before,
[5491.48 → 5492.88] versus augmented reality?
[5493.10 → 5494.92] Which one you would be more excited about
[5494.92 → 5497.50] if you could have a full setup of either of them
[5497.50 → 5499.00] for the same price, let's say,
[5499.18 → 5500.60] and it supported all the same games?
[5500.78 → 5503.70] So Infinite VR versus Infinite AR?
[5504.16 → 5507.52] Versus, no, just AR, like, running around out and about.
[5508.18 → 5510.58] Okay, so let's keep Twitter blitzing here, guys.
[5511.10 → 5511.54] Someone says,
[5511.64 → 5512.42] Don't buy it.
[5512.48 → 5515.20] My Asus TB100 performs probably just as good.
[5515.24 → 5516.58] If you can borrow it, do that, of course,
[5516.64 → 5517.68] but it's not worth your own money.
[5518.34 → 5520.84] Demon's, yeah, I know you want it.
[5520.92 → 5521.90] Guys, by the way,
[5522.26 → 5524.48] this is the Demon's
[5524.48 → 5526.32] who you can do two things for.
[5526.44 → 5527.16] One of two things.
[5527.22 → 5528.42] You can either thank him
[5528.42 → 5531.46] for being the one who does the Sancho table of contents,
[5531.76 → 5533.34] or you control him
[5533.34 → 5535.72] for being the one who makes the occasional mistake
[5535.72 → 5536.94] in the Sancho table of contents,
[5537.18 → 5539.00] but huge shout out to Demon's
[5539.00 → 5540.22] because without him,
[5540.22 → 5542.52] the Sancho takes a lot longer for us to get up
[5542.52 → 5544.10] because by the end of Friday,
[5544.60 → 5546.08] Luke and I are just exhausted,
[5546.70 → 5548.98] and going back and re-watching the show
[5548.98 → 5550.24] that we just broadcast
[5550.24 → 5553.70] and, like, creating a table of contents for it
[5553.70 → 5556.14] is not real high on our list of things
[5556.14 → 5557.98] that we, like, super awesomely want to do,
[5558.06 → 5559.40] and Demon's was actually the one
[5559.40 → 5560.52] who came up with the idea
[5560.52 → 5563.08] of doing a condensed table of contents
[5563.08 → 5564.72] and then the super detailed one
[5564.72 → 5566.98] that you guys can find topic by topic
[5566.98 → 5568.42] what interests you the most.
[5568.42 → 5571.26] Hey, Twitch decided to allow me to be a mod again.
[5571.52 → 5571.82] Oh, cool.
[5571.86 → 5572.40] That's cool.
[5572.50 → 5572.80] That's good.
[5572.80 → 5574.20] I wasn't this entire stream so far.
[5574.44 → 5575.82] I would like to see the new Surface,
[5575.94 → 5576.92] but wouldn't be the end of the world
[5576.92 → 5577.96] if I didn't get one.
[5578.04 → 5578.28] Okay.
[5578.48 → 5578.86] All right.
[5579.28 → 5580.12] Lower your dangers
[5580.12 → 5581.60] because the mods are Perm-banning
[5581.60 → 5582.72] for flexing dangers.
[5582.72 → 5585.24] The Surface looks great.
[5585.44 → 5586.28] Don't have the money now.
[5586.34 → 5587.48] So much better than terrible.
[5588.12 → 5590.62] Windows 8.1 is still a real challenge for me.
[5591.32 → 5591.72] Like, I still...
[5592.92 → 5593.84] Commissions issues, man.
[5594.04 → 5594.82] You know what it is?
[5595.54 → 5597.66] 95, 98% of the time,
[5597.88 → 5599.30] I'm 100% okay with it,
[5599.68 → 5602.00] but then when I'm actually in a hurry
[5602.00 → 5603.02] to get something done
[5603.02 → 5606.48] and I swipe off the side of my touchpad
[5606.48 → 5607.52] accidentally
[5607.52 → 5609.08] when I'm just trying to move the mouse,
[5610.26 → 5613.32] it really drives me up the wall.
[5613.44 → 5613.52] Yeah.
[5613.52 → 5614.46] It really does.
[5614.58 → 5617.54] In a way that I can't even rationally justify.
[5618.86 → 5619.14] But...
[5619.14 → 5621.04] And like when I...
[5621.04 → 5623.10] When I fire up a new PC
[5623.10 → 5625.70] and I go to listen to a song
[5625.70 → 5626.90] or look at a picture
[5626.90 → 5628.60] and it opens that garbage
[5628.60 → 5630.28] modern UI application
[5630.28 → 5631.12] that is just...
[5631.12 → 5632.22] Fewer hurdles to jump through.
[5632.36 → 5632.80] Worthless.
[5633.42 → 5633.94] I just...
[5633.94 → 5634.68] On Windows 7.
[5634.70 → 5635.58] I just go...
[5635.58 → 5637.98] And I have to sit and wait for it to launch
[5637.98 → 5639.22] and they're so slow.
[5639.24 → 5639.94] They're really slow.
[5640.08 → 5641.24] They're slow to launch
[5641.24 → 5641.80] and it's just...
[5641.80 → 5643.14] I know, it's only a few seconds
[5643.14 → 5644.74] and this is a total first world problem
[5644.74 → 5645.36] and it's stupid.
[5645.62 → 5647.44] But it's not slow to launch the desktop app.
[5647.48 → 5649.32] But it's not slow to launch the desktop app.
[5649.38 → 5651.40] We're solving a problem that we never had.
[5652.02 → 5652.24] Anyway.
[5652.76 → 5655.04] Yes, please do it, says Sebastian.
[5655.04 → 5655.16] Question.
[5656.08 → 5657.08] Isn't it funny
[5657.08 → 5658.08] how you care more about
[5658.08 → 5659.26] the way your case interior looks
[5659.26 → 5660.32] than the way your watch looks?
[5660.36 → 5661.20] What's wrong with my watch?
[5661.76 → 5662.16] Yeah, really.
[5662.52 → 5663.18] I like this watch.
[5663.20 → 5664.66] Actually, a lot of people have asked me
[5664.66 → 5666.28] but this is a Bonito smartwatch.
[5666.48 → 5668.26] I haven't spent much time with the app yet
[5668.26 → 5669.36] so don't run out and buy them
[5669.36 → 5670.46] just because I'm wearing it yet.
[5670.56 → 5672.26] I will let you guys know what I think of it.
[5672.58 → 5674.28] But I've had a lot of people compliment me
[5674.28 → 5674.84] on this watch
[5674.84 → 5676.06] to be perfectly honest.
[5677.78 → 5678.92] More people than the Pebble.
[5679.04 → 5679.94] With the Pebble, people are like,
[5679.98 → 5680.46] what is that?
[5680.86 → 5681.90] With this one, people are like,
[5682.02 → 5682.66] oh, what's that?
[5682.66 → 5687.68] Yeah, 0.01 cares about Microsoft hardware.
[5689.70 → 5691.20] Hashtag, just get Asus to build it.
[5692.50 → 5693.62] It would be really nice
[5693.62 → 5695.44] if you review the Surface Pro 3.
[5695.56 → 5696.88] Already considered buying it,
[5696.96 → 5697.90] buying the Surface Pro 2.
[5698.18 → 5698.26] Okay.
[5699.26 → 5699.70] Someone said,
[5699.74 → 5700.26] Ant says,
[5700.42 → 5702.10] review a base Surface 3.
[5702.50 → 5703.60] That's an interesting angle
[5703.60 → 5704.62] where we go,
[5704.72 → 5706.92] okay, here is the starting point
[5706.92 → 5708.26] because I think almost everyone else
[5708.26 → 5709.02] is going to be looking at
[5709.02 → 5710.58] high-end or mid-range configurations.
[5710.58 → 5712.12] Whereas if we go,
[5712.22 → 5712.98] okay, no, we're going to do
[5712.98 → 5714.58] like a perfect review of like...
[5714.58 → 5715.48] So this is the Surface 3.
[5715.60 → 5716.94] By the way, you can also get these things.
[5717.00 → 5717.36] By the way.
[5717.54 → 5718.22] You can buy the higher-end models.
[5718.30 → 5719.92] Go look at other people's reviews
[5719.92 → 5720.58] if you want to know
[5720.58 → 5722.84] what like the Core i7 one performs like.
[5723.40 → 5724.06] That's interesting.
[5724.18 → 5724.76] It's not a bad idea.
[5725.06 → 5726.04] It'll also save you some money.
[5727.06 → 5727.42] Ashley.
[5727.82 → 5728.88] Okay, you were doing pretty well
[5728.88 → 5729.34] in this tweet
[5729.34 → 5730.06] up till the bit about
[5730.06 → 5731.26] putting 10 gigabit Ethernet
[5731.26 → 5732.14] on the Surface 4.
[5732.38 → 5733.94] I don't think that's going
[5733.94 → 5734.76] to happen so good.
[5735.72 → 5736.58] Did we just lose
[5736.58 → 5738.62] a hockey game to the Finns?
[5739.24 → 5740.28] Is that the joke here?
[5740.58 → 5741.02] What's going on
[5741.02 → 5741.72] in the World Championships?
[5741.86 → 5742.80] I haven't actually looked at it
[5742.80 → 5743.60] in the last couple of days.
[5744.58 → 5746.74] I don't think we did last night.
[5748.08 → 5749.74] Pretty sure we didn't lose last night.
[5750.68 → 5751.74] Oh, World Championships.
[5751.98 → 5753.46] Yeah, World Championships hockey.
[5754.06 → 5754.88] I don't know.
[5755.02 → 5756.34] I haven't been paying that
[5756.34 → 5757.40] wanting team kind of...
[5757.40 → 5758.66] Coach Dave Tippett
[5758.66 → 5759.54] thought that...
[5759.54 → 5760.36] Yeah, no.
[5761.08 → 5761.84] They beat the Finns.
[5762.06 → 5762.70] Yeah, screw you guys.
[5762.70 → 5765.34] Okay, I have the Pro 2.
[5765.50 → 5766.14] It's awesome.
[5766.44 → 5767.06] Review the Pro 3.
[5767.14 → 5767.98] Says Biebskidoo,
[5768.40 → 5769.94] who is my favourite
[5769.94 → 5771.74] whatever you are.
[5773.36 → 5774.08] Cool guy.
[5774.44 → 5775.02] Favourite dude.
[5775.46 → 5776.94] The Surface is the one
[5776.94 → 5777.34] to review.
[5777.46 → 5777.86] Go for it.
[5777.92 → 5779.02] Okay, so it looks like
[5779.02 → 5780.10] people straight up
[5780.10 → 5781.26] really want me to check out
[5781.26 → 5781.88] the Surface 3.
[5782.02 → 5783.14] Okay, I'm going to...
[5783.14 → 5784.10] I'm going to order one today.
[5784.52 → 5785.60] Okay, I'll order one.
[5786.02 → 5786.82] And, you know,
[5786.88 → 5788.00] if someone wants to,
[5788.02 → 5788.20] you know,
[5788.24 → 5788.98] buy it off of us
[5788.98 → 5789.84] on the garage sale,
[5790.08 → 5790.90] I can promise you
[5790.90 → 5792.02] there will be a bit of a deal,
[5792.14 → 5792.82] but it might not be
[5792.82 → 5793.62] a lot cheaper
[5793.62 → 5795.16] than, you know,
[5795.24 → 5795.98] than a Surface 3
[5795.98 → 5797.56] that you buy new,
[5797.70 → 5798.82] but it'll be in great condition.
[5798.90 → 5799.98] I'll take perfect care of it
[5799.98 → 5801.30] to the best of my ability
[5801.30 → 5801.82] here, guys.
[5803.66 → 5804.88] Zach Janus says,
[5804.98 → 5805.66] why not just get
[5805.66 → 5806.40] a convertible notebook?
[5806.52 → 5806.88] You know what?
[5806.88 → 5807.88] It's a great question.
[5808.32 → 5810.56] And I was using a Dell XPS 12
[5810.56 → 5811.46] for a long time,
[5811.50 → 5812.68] which is a convertible notebook.
[5812.86 → 5814.32] The reason I would say
[5814.32 → 5815.24] that a Surface 3
[5815.24 → 5816.10] might make sense
[5816.10 → 5818.44] is that a convertible notebook
[5818.44 → 5819.80] is not a tablet,
[5820.34 → 5821.52] whereas a Surface 3
[5821.52 → 5823.00] is a tablet,
[5823.32 → 5824.82] but it also has
[5824.82 → 5827.02] so much more capability
[5827.02 → 5827.82] than a tablet
[5827.82 → 5829.72] because of the kickstand,
[5829.94 → 5831.36] because of the stylus,
[5831.50 → 5832.82] because of the ability
[5832.82 → 5834.22] to add these keyboard accessories
[5834.22 → 5835.86] that are well implemented
[5835.86 → 5836.74] and not kludge.
[5836.74 → 5837.60] I also find that
[5837.60 → 5838.52] this tablet's going to be
[5838.52 → 5839.64] a lot thinner and smaller.
[5839.82 → 5840.66] It's much thinner,
[5841.04 → 5841.74] much lighter,
[5842.14 → 5843.84] so there are real reasons
[5843.84 → 5844.88] why Surface makes sense
[5844.88 → 5848.80] instead of a convertible notebook.
[5849.76 → 5850.12] Apparently,
[5850.24 → 5850.78] the i5 model
[5850.78 → 5851.46] comes out two months
[5851.46 → 5852.14] sooner than the others,
[5852.24 → 5853.42] so I guess we might end up
[5853.42 → 5855.24] just hitting that one,
[5855.30 → 5855.70] I guess.
[5856.70 → 5857.42] Philipp says,
[5857.54 → 5858.00] yeah, yeah,
[5858.00 → 5858.78] I'll definitely take it
[5858.78 → 5859.40] after you review it.
[5859.44 → 5860.04] All right, fair enough.
[5860.54 → 5861.24] Oh, we've got people
[5861.24 → 5862.26] asking about the Modes
[5862.26 → 5862.92] sweepstakes,
[5863.46 → 5864.02] or geek stakes,
[5864.12 → 5864.60] excuse me.
[5864.60 → 5865.74] I think the draw
[5865.74 → 5866.60] is in eight minutes,
[5866.84 → 5867.90] unless it was at nine.
[5868.28 → 5869.06] Shoot, I'm...
[5869.06 → 5871.10] I'm at a bit of a loss here.
[5871.22 → 5871.56] Okay, well,
[5871.66 → 5872.42] either way, guys,
[5872.42 → 5873.62] go back every weekday
[5873.62 → 5874.44] and make sure
[5874.44 → 5876.30] that you go check that out.
[5876.46 → 5877.38] And thanks again to Modes
[5877.38 → 5878.90] for sponsoring our show today.
[5879.64 → 5880.80] Have you seen
[5880.80 → 5881.42] the metal...
[5882.08 → 5882.42] metaclasses...
[5883.12 → 5884.20] space glasses for AR?
[5884.28 → 5884.78] No, I haven't,
[5884.88 → 5885.76] but we don't click links
[5885.76 → 5886.42] on Twitter
[5887.12 → 5888.08] on the WAN show anymore
[5888.08 → 5889.26] after some bad experiences.
[5889.26 → 5891.40] I don't think that's
[5891.40 → 5892.26] the best still grab
[5892.26 → 5893.30] of Luke ever.
[5893.60 → 5893.92] No, no.
[5895.18 → 5897.32] Okay, so that's about it.
[5897.76 → 5898.68] Setting aside the money
[5898.68 → 5901.24] Nintendo and Sony has,
[5901.58 → 5902.86] what would be the ups and downs
[5902.86 → 5903.82] of Nintendo
[5903.82 → 5907.00] straight up buying PlayStation?
[5909.10 → 5910.40] I'd be down with Nintendo
[5910.40 → 5911.10] buying PlayStation.
[5911.44 → 5912.54] They won't at all,
[5912.68 → 5913.06] for sure.
[5913.06 → 5913.54] Yeah, because, I mean,
[5913.60 → 5914.44] the thing is that...
[5914.44 → 5915.62] It's not in their, like,
[5915.74 → 5916.54] model at all.
[5916.54 → 5919.36] The thing that I think people
[5919.36 → 5922.96] need to get about Nintendo
[5922.96 → 5925.18] is that they're not having
[5925.18 → 5926.06] trouble right now
[5926.06 → 5927.48] because they can't
[5927.48 → 5929.44] build a powerful gaming console
[5929.44 → 5931.82] or because they can't
[5931.82 → 5932.76] pursue the whole
[5932.76 → 5933.82] third-party AAA...
[5933.82 → 5934.20] Well, okay,
[5934.24 → 5934.80] they are having trouble
[5934.80 → 5935.50] pursuing third-party
[5935.50 → 5936.28] AAA gaming titles,
[5936.58 → 5937.58] but it's because
[5937.58 → 5940.46] of the different approach
[5940.46 → 5941.46] that they believe
[5942.06 → 5942.88] in pursuing
[5942.88 → 5944.06] with, you know,
[5944.24 → 5945.26] multiple screens
[5945.26 → 5947.02] and different controller
[5947.02 → 5947.68] schemas
[5947.68 → 5948.60] and all that kind of stuff.
[5948.96 → 5949.94] It's not like Nintendo
[5949.94 → 5951.12] doesn't know how
[5951.12 → 5952.20] to build a brick
[5952.20 → 5952.94] with controllers
[5952.94 → 5953.70] plugged into it.
[5954.08 → 5954.86] So they wouldn't
[5954.86 → 5955.74] buy PlayStation
[5955.74 → 5956.98] for the sake of
[5956.98 → 5957.98] the innovation
[5957.98 → 5959.70] of PS4
[5959.70 → 5960.46] being a brick
[5960.46 → 5961.16] with controllers
[5961.16 → 5963.08] wirelessly connected
[5963.08 → 5963.72] to it
[5963.72 → 5965.08] versus being plugged
[5965.08 → 5965.46] into it.
[5965.48 → 5965.96] They have wireless
[5965.96 → 5966.72] controllers,
[5966.96 → 5967.46] all Whims.
[5967.84 → 5968.62] So I just think
[5968.62 → 5969.52] straight up,
[5969.80 → 5971.08] Nintendo just wouldn't
[5971.08 → 5971.78] even be interested
[5971.78 → 5972.74] even if they could
[5972.74 → 5973.20] afford it.
[5973.34 → 5973.92] Nope, I don't think
[5973.92 → 5974.28] so either.
[5974.70 → 5976.14] And I'm okay with that.
[5976.40 → 5977.64] I think Wii U
[5977.64 → 5978.54] and I think
[5978.54 → 5979.32] 2DS 3DS
[5979.32 → 5980.42] deserves a lot more
[5980.42 → 5981.38] attention and a lot
[5981.38 → 5981.84] more respect
[5981.84 → 5982.32] than it gets
[5982.32 → 5983.48] because honestly,
[5984.00 → 5985.54] 2DS 3DS is really fun.
[5986.34 → 5987.16] They're integrated
[5987.16 → 5987.80] super well.
[5988.02 → 5988.56] That's another thing
[5988.56 → 5989.22] people don't understand
[5989.22 → 5989.72] is everyone
[5989.72 → 5991.86] will complain for days
[5991.86 → 5993.10] when Battlefield
[5993.10 → 5994.04] doesn't work
[5994.04 → 5994.94] off the bat
[5994.94 → 5996.02] and Titan fall
[5996.02 → 5996.86] is not very well
[5996.86 → 5997.62] optimized for PC
[5997.62 → 5998.30] off the bat
[5998.30 → 5999.08] and there's like
[5999.08 → 6000.06] all these problems
[6000.06 → 6001.12] all over the place.
[6001.12 → 6002.58] but then when
[6002.58 → 6003.26] every single
[6003.26 → 6004.10] Nintendo game
[6004.10 → 6005.14] like ever
[6005.14 → 6006.48] works completely
[6006.48 → 6007.04] flawlessly
[6007.04 → 6007.86] out of the box
[6007.86 → 6009.26] as far as I can
[6009.26 → 6009.68] think of
[6009.68 → 6010.56] off the top of my head
[6010.56 → 6012.16] no one seems
[6012.16 → 6012.90] to really care.
[6013.36 → 6014.16] I have a Wii U
[6014.16 → 6015.10] and I have a 2DS
[6015.10 → 6015.46] they're both
[6015.46 → 6016.40] absolutely fantastic.
[6016.54 → 6016.94] Whenever anyone
[6016.94 → 6017.56] comes over
[6017.56 → 6018.62] we often end up
[6018.62 → 6019.24] playing Wii U
[6019.24 → 6020.26] because PC games
[6020.26 → 6020.86] are great
[6020.86 → 6021.76] but they're great
[6021.76 → 6022.24] when your buddy
[6022.24 → 6023.30] is still at his house
[6023.30 → 6024.76] or you're landing
[6024.76 → 6025.64] and that's actually
[6025.64 → 6026.24] kind of difficult
[6026.24 → 6027.54] to do all the time.
[6027.54 → 6029.08] So yeah
[6029.08 → 6029.74] I don't know
[6029.74 → 6031.20] I think they deserve
[6031.20 → 6031.82] a lot more attention
[6031.82 → 6032.28] than they get.
[6032.38 → 6033.34] I mean speaking of
[6033.34 → 6034.76] their games
[6034.76 → 6035.70] all working flawlessly
[6035.70 → 6036.90] the Game Spy servers
[6036.90 → 6037.78] shutting down
[6037.78 → 6039.28] was a bit of a problem
[6039.28 → 6040.80] recently for DS owners
[6040.80 → 6041.48] who still want to play
[6041.48 → 6042.06] Mario Kart
[6042.06 → 6042.90] Wii owners
[6042.90 → 6043.52] who still want to
[6043.52 → 6044.08] play their games
[6044.08 → 6044.34] but
[6044.34 → 6046.56] there's some good news
[6046.56 → 6047.36] out of all of this
[6047.36 → 6048.04] as well
[6048.04 → 6048.74] this was originally
[6048.74 → 6049.32] posted by
[6049.32 → 6050.16] Bonsai99
[6050.16 → 6051.04] on the forum
[6051.04 → 6052.14] and here's a post
[6052.14 → 6053.46] from Bungie.net
[6053.46 → 6055.46] Halo PC
[6055.46 → 6057.52] Combat Evolved
[6057.52 → 6058.98] and Custom Edition
[6058.98 → 6061.80] there's a new patch.
[6063.72 → 6065.06] So the Game Spy servers
[6065.06 → 6065.64] went down
[6065.64 → 6066.48] so you weren't going
[6066.48 → 6067.32] to be able to
[6067.32 → 6068.78] even look
[6068.78 → 6069.84] for online servers
[6069.84 → 6070.52] because the
[6070.52 → 6071.44] server list
[6071.44 → 6072.66] server is gone.
[6073.16 → 6074.04] So some dude
[6074.04 → 6074.70] in the community
[6074.70 → 6076.14] coded a new server list
[6076.14 → 6077.10] Bungee put up
[6077.10 → 6078.04] some of their own servers
[6078.04 → 6079.20] to host this stuff
[6079.20 → 6081.16] and things are rolling again.
[6081.30 → 6082.00] One of the big things
[6082.00 → 6082.64] in the new patch
[6082.64 → 6083.64] was they did a bunch
[6083.64 → 6084.64] of small bug fixes
[6084.64 → 6085.64] so essentially
[6085.64 → 6086.80] the game should have died
[6086.80 → 6087.42] this month.
[6087.84 → 6088.82] And Bungee was just like
[6088.82 → 6089.54] nope!
[6089.84 → 6090.42] Here's patches
[6090.42 → 6091.40] fixing things
[6091.40 → 6092.12] here's patches
[6092.12 → 6093.44] bringing the servers back
[6093.44 → 6094.64] you guys are good to go.
[6095.26 → 6096.08] And that's awesome.
[6096.24 → 6097.60] That's super cool.
[6098.00 → 6099.30] Like so much more
[6099.30 → 6100.22] respect for Bungee now.
[6100.26 → 6100.70] So like
[6100.70 → 6102.10] it's fixing things like
[6102.10 → 6103.26] upper boundary
[6103.26 → 6103.98] on video resolution
[6104.54 → 6106.30] fixing things like
[6106.30 → 6107.34] they're even fixing
[6107.34 → 6108.66] they fixed active camo
[6108.66 → 6109.66] on Nvidia cards.
[6109.66 → 6111.74] like they're even fixing
[6111.74 → 6113.32] like graphical stuff.
[6113.82 → 6114.96] Never mind crashes
[6114.96 → 6115.66] or like
[6115.66 → 6116.96] oh man
[6116.96 → 6117.76] that is just
[6117.76 → 6118.80] so cool.
[6119.04 → 6119.52] There was a bunch
[6119.52 → 6120.22] of different members
[6120.22 → 6120.72] of the community
[6120.72 → 6121.40] that brought up
[6121.40 → 6122.18] some of these bugs
[6122.18 → 6123.10] and like different ways
[6123.10 → 6123.84] that they could fix it
[6123.84 → 6124.18] and whatnot
[6124.18 → 6125.66] and that guy in the community
[6125.66 → 6126.88] coded this list
[6126.88 → 6127.28] and people
[6127.28 → 6128.30] I know people
[6128.30 → 6128.90] are going to come back
[6128.90 → 6129.22] and be like
[6129.22 → 6130.36] oh well they kept it up
[6130.36 → 6130.96] because like
[6130.96 → 6132.06] strong community focus
[6132.06 → 6132.88] and the community
[6132.88 → 6134.32] kind of fixed everything
[6134.32 → 6134.84] for them
[6134.84 → 6135.72] doesn't matter.
[6135.88 → 6136.34] This happens
[6136.34 → 6137.48] all the time.
[6137.68 → 6137.80] Yeah.
[6138.10 → 6139.42] There's super dedicated people
[6139.42 → 6140.76] in so many different communities
[6140.76 → 6141.34] it's insane.
[6141.52 → 6142.76] That ask really nicely
[6142.76 → 6143.46] really nicely
[6143.46 → 6144.46] to even be allowed
[6144.46 → 6145.28] to fix it.
[6145.44 → 6145.92] Yeah exactly.
[6146.10 → 6146.84] Yeah this happens
[6146.84 → 6147.78] all the time.
[6148.02 → 6148.38] It just
[6148.38 → 6149.14] it took Bungee
[6149.14 → 6150.10] to actually accept
[6150.10 → 6150.68] this help
[6150.68 → 6151.46] and actually do it
[6151.46 → 6152.40] and then thank those people
[6152.40 → 6153.46] which I think is really cool.
[6153.58 → 6154.40] I think this is just
[6154.40 → 6155.38] like the coolest
[6155.38 → 6157.08] most like feeling happy
[6157.08 → 6158.60] like gaming news
[6158.60 → 6159.52] that like
[6159.52 → 6160.02] I just
[6160.02 → 6161.38] I want to go buy a copy.
[6161.56 → 6162.18] I want to go back
[6162.18 → 6162.74] and play Halo.
[6162.80 → 6164.04] I just want to go buy a copy
[6164.04 → 6165.66] and like play the heck out of it.
[6165.72 → 6166.80] Go play through the single player.
[6167.24 → 6167.52] We should
[6167.52 → 6168.72] like I've wanted to do this
[6168.72 → 6169.20] a long time.
[6169.26 → 6170.20] Okay you know what guys
[6170.20 → 6171.62] you have to let us know.
[6171.94 → 6173.42] You have to let us know.
[6174.36 → 6175.48] If we did
[6175.48 → 6177.46] a very small LAN event
[6177.46 → 6179.30] in Vancouver
[6179.30 → 6181.06] would you guys be down
[6181.06 → 6182.44] to help us cover the costs?
[6182.78 → 6184.26] It would be a very small LAN event
[6184.26 → 6185.10] and it wouldn't be like
[6185.10 → 6186.04] at my house or anything
[6186.04 → 6187.26] so we would have to actually
[6187.26 → 6187.86] get a venue
[6187.86 → 6189.60] so it might not be that cheap.
[6190.06 → 6190.12] No.
[6190.30 → 6192.00] But would you guys be down
[6192.00 → 6193.10] to come and hang with us?
[6193.10 → 6194.16] I have to say
[6194.16 → 6195.32] I haven't played
[6195.32 → 6196.92] much in the way of video games
[6196.92 → 6197.84] in the last little while
[6197.84 → 6199.72] and I firmly believe
[6199.72 → 6201.12] that a LAN is only fun
[6201.12 → 6202.04] as long as everyone
[6202.04 → 6203.14] is on the same page
[6203.14 → 6204.34] and playing the same game
[6204.34 → 6205.60] so we would publish
[6205.60 → 6206.78] a games list
[6206.78 → 6207.88] and we would expect people
[6207.88 → 6208.30] to come
[6208.30 → 6209.50] and play those games
[6209.50 → 6210.42] and have fun
[6210.42 → 6211.40] and eat some snacks
[6211.40 → 6212.62] but would you guys be down
[6212.62 → 6213.92] to come to something like that?
[6214.10 → 6214.88] Even if
[6214.88 → 6215.82] it was like
[6215.82 → 6216.60] full on
[6216.60 → 6217.66] Nazi mode
[6217.66 → 6219.04] anyone opens
[6219.04 → 6219.66] WoW
[6219.66 → 6220.84] at this LAN
[6220.84 → 6222.22] we will literally
[6222.22 → 6223.38] have him
[6223.38 → 6224.10] pick you up
[6224.10 → 6225.78] pick up your computer
[6225.78 → 6226.76] and throw both of you
[6226.76 → 6227.30] out the door
[6227.30 → 6228.48] We'll bring my brother too
[6228.48 → 6228.92] just in case
[6228.92 → 6229.62] Yeah we'll bring your brother too
[6229.62 → 6230.54] just in case we need
[6230.54 → 6231.44] some more like
[6231.44 → 6232.40] thug muscle
[6232.40 → 6234.24] but there you go guys
[6234.24 → 6235.30] would you be down to come
[6235.30 → 6235.98] let us know
[6235.98 → 6236.64] on Twitter
[6236.64 → 6237.62] I'm not going to blitz it
[6237.62 → 6238.00] right now
[6238.00 → 6238.78] but I will definitely
[6238.78 → 6239.56] check it out later
[6239.56 → 6240.94] and I'd love to see
[6240.94 → 6241.64] the results of that
[6241.64 → 6242.06] Stropped
[6242.06 → 6243.44] that we created before
[6243.44 → 6243.84] so here
[6243.84 → 6244.56] no, no I'm just gonna
[6244.56 → 6246.16] we'll switch over to you here
[6246.16 → 6247.20] so in theory
[6247.20 → 6247.52] this will work now
[6247.52 → 6247.82] Stropped was having
[6247.82 → 6250.06] an issue on Firefox
[6250.06 → 6251.64] but I've got it up in Chrome
[6251.64 → 6253.06] Way to be Stropped
[6253.06 → 6253.96] okay so
[6253.96 → 6254.32] here we go
[6254.32 → 6255.88] I did allow multiple votes
[6255.88 → 6256.24] Seriously?
[6256.46 → 6257.68] I did allow multiple votes
[6257.68 → 6258.64] That's how it's going to be
[6258.64 → 6259.98] so I made it so that people
[6259.98 → 6261.36] could vote for multiple things
[6261.36 → 6262.00] and a lot of people
[6262.00 → 6263.00] still just decided
[6263.00 → 6264.06] to vote for one thing
[6264.06 → 6264.96] and that was
[6264.96 → 6265.92] the Linus rap battle
[6265.92 → 6267.40] I got after you
[6267.40 → 6268.12] for posting like
[6268.12 → 6268.58] banana
[6268.58 → 6269.86] and all this other crap
[6269.86 → 6270.72] and all of our polls
[6270.72 → 6271.20] so I was like
[6271.20 → 6271.54] you know what
[6271.54 → 6271.92] whatever
[6271.92 → 6272.70] I can do it too
[6272.70 → 6274.22] so Linus rap battle
[6274.22 → 6275.96] wins with 70% of the votes
[6275.96 → 6278.36] and then the rest of it
[6278.36 → 6280.16] got almost no votes
[6280.16 → 6281.66] This isn't even like
[6281.66 → 6283.02] statistically significant
[6283.02 → 6284.62] Not even close
[6284.62 → 6286.46] so both the other options
[6286.46 → 6288.36] got under 20%
[6288.36 → 6289.46] I hate you
[6289.46 → 6290.30] Infinite VR
[6290.30 → 6291.70] coming in at 17%
[6291.70 → 6292.40] and AR
[6292.40 → 6293.98] not even getting 15%
[6293.98 → 6295.26] coming in at 13%
[6295.26 → 6296.62] Personally I vote for AR
[6296.62 → 6297.34] running around
[6297.34 → 6299.40] but Infinite VR
[6299.40 → 6300.50] would be awesome
[6300.50 → 6301.18] as well
[6301.18 → 6302.38] and I think the
[6302.38 → 6303.90] nice smooth experience
[6303.90 → 6304.78] would probably come
[6304.78 → 6306.90] first to Infinite
[6306.90 → 6308.24] VR style gaming
[6308.24 → 6309.78] because being able
[6309.78 → 6310.84] to actively render
[6310.84 → 6311.76] things in AR
[6311.76 → 6313.28] AI really, really well
[6313.28 → 6313.96] and on the fly
[6313.96 → 6314.24] and stuff
[6314.24 → 6314.92] I think is not
[6314.92 → 6315.44] really going to happen
[6315.44 → 6316.04] for a little while
[6316.04 → 6317.58] now it's at 69%
[6317.58 → 6318.36] that's perfect
[6318.36 → 6319.40] Alright well
[6319.40 → 6320.66] on that
[6320.66 → 6322.88] completely mature
[6322.88 → 6323.56] and
[6323.56 → 6326.06] sophisticated note
[6326.06 → 6327.40] thank you guys
[6327.40 → 6328.34] very much for tuning
[6328.34 → 6329.28] into the WAN show
[6329.28 → 6329.96] we'll see you guys
[6329.96 → 6330.94] again next week
[6330.94 → 6331.48] and
[6331.48 → 6332.98] I'll probably
[6332.98 → 6333.98] I don't think I'm going
[6333.98 → 6334.66] to do a garage sale
[6334.66 → 6335.74] today, but I'll come back
[6335.74 → 6336.60] and stream for a couple
[6336.60 → 6336.90] minutes
[6336.90 → 6337.68] but then I have to go
[6337.68 → 6339.18] get the baby
[6339.18 → 6340.96] so good stuff
[6340.96 → 6341.58] Alright
[6341.58 → 6346.04] Seriously
[6346.04 → 6347.08] You have to pull the thing up
[6347.08 → 6347.92] Way to go
[6347.92 → 6348.58] Oh if I
[6348.58 → 6349.92] Oh
[6349.92 → 6351.92] Oh
[6352.44 → 6369.16] We just had
[6369.16 → 6370.16] Talk46
[6370.16 → 6371.12] message us
[6371.12 → 6371.74] and let us know
[6371.74 → 6372.72] that the Mario Kart
[6372.72 → 6373.44] Wii community
[6373.44 → 6374.78] also managed to create
[6374.78 → 6376.28] custom server
[6376.28 → 6377.48] something
[6377.48 → 6378.30] well it's a tweet
[6378.30 → 6378.80] so I don't know
[6378.80 → 6379.30] that the grammar
[6379.30 → 6380.22] is necessarily correct
[6380.22 → 6380.96] but there you go
[6380.96 → 6381.32] so
[6381.32 → 6382.58] That's pretty cool
[6382.58 → 6382.86] Yeah
