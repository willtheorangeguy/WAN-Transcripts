[0.00 → 5.44] Well that was fun. I think we're actually live for real this time, and you know,
[5.44 → 10.24] third time's a charm. Yeah. Right? So let's go through our topics extremely
[10.24 → 13.68] quickly. We're going to do the million subscriber giveaway this week on the
[13.68 → 17.56] WAN Show live here in front of all of you. We're gonna talk about Apple's
[17.56 → 21.92] Bend gate fiasco with the iPhone 6 Plus. He's lost his topic introduction
[21.92 → 25.52] privileges. I've covered this before but for those of you who are freshly watching
[25.52 → 28.68] this and didn't watch the first two false starts of the show, I have to make
[28.68 → 34.68] sure I throw that in there. Paul and Kyle have both left New egg, and we're gonna
[34.68 → 37.80] have them on the show to talk a little bit about what's going on. Maybe we'll do
[37.80 → 44.10] some Twitter blitzing and Intel spent a metric bucket ton of money on their new
[44.10 → 51.34] 10 nanometre process manufacturing facility in Israel or will rather. It's not like
[51.34 → 58.56] done yet. We can't have 10 nanometre processors yet, but soon we hope. See if
[58.56 → 64.56] this works. Yeah! I don't hear any sound. Oh.
[64.56 → 79.74] Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait for it, wait, for it, wait for it. Linus is a dude. And you think that's funny?
[83.28 → 86.98] Okay, so anyway. Square Space is one of our sponsors for the show today. Create your own
[86.98 → 92.56] beautiful, functional website. It's affordable, it's scalable, and it's 10% off with offer code
[92.56 → 99.36] Linus. Also, we have, ah, lynda.com, also a sponsor of the show today. Learn, expand your mind, make
[99.36 → 106.58] your brain smarter, lynda.com, and that is exactly how they asked me to say that. Here's a
[106.58 → 115.64] hint, it's not. So, we've got a lot of great topics for this week. Can I help you? Nope. Okay. A lot of
[115.64 → 121.74] great topics for this week. There's a rumour that is on WCCF Tech, although you don't freak out, it's
[121.74 → 129.72] actually originally posted by PC Tuning, that NVIDIA's Maxwell GM200 GPU could be coming as soon
[129.72 → 138.62] as Q4 of this year. So, it's rumoured to have a die size of 551mm2, making it the big core in the
[138.62 → 146.72] Maxwell family, with over 2,500 coup de corps, so anywhere from 2,560 to 2,816, and...
[146.72 → 155.24] So, we decided to troll you a little bit. If you notice, your shirt is slightly different from my
[155.24 → 162.02] shirt. My shirt's better. My shirt has three people, and so do all of theirs. Hello. So, there's a whole
[162.02 → 167.12] bunch of shirts that have three people, and if you pay a lot of attention... Whoa!
[167.12 → 172.22] ... Fractal Design logo on the back. And if you pay a lot of attention to what's on the shirt,
[172.22 → 176.96] there's Fractal Josh in the middle, because he's super tall. Yeah. And he's bro-like,
[176.96 → 182.92] bro fisting me. Yeah. And then throwing a pie in your face. Yeah, that's a pretty lame shirt.
[182.92 → 194.12] Well, I told him I wouldn't tell you, but Brandon might have leaked the seatbelt. What?! You're so lame!
[194.12 → 201.02] It was a complete accident! Oh my god! So... How did you do that? I unzipped my hoodie, and then he saw it. I was like...
[201.02 → 206.12] He's like, well, actually, initially, he's like, oh, nice shirt! So... And then I turned around, I'm thinking that he didn't realize...
[206.12 → 213.12] Are you putting a tape over mine? So, I have prepared in advance my rebuttal...
[213.12 → 215.12] Oh! Ha ha ha ha!
[215.12 → 217.12] ...which is that you are fired.
[217.12 → 219.12] Ha ha ha!
[219.12 → 224.12] You are no longer allowed to be on... My, like, arm and legs are still there. No, don't worry, I'm going to deal with it.
[224.12 → 230.12] You are. God, Brandon, you're horrible. I'm sorry, it was an accident! You could've at least told me!
[230.12 → 237.12] Well, I told him I wouldn't tell you guys. Well, yeah! But then I did. But then... Wow!
[237.12 → 240.12] I want... I want that smash back.
[240.12 → 241.12] Yeah.
[241.12 → 242.12] Get rest!
[242.12 → 246.12] Josh says, if people want these shirts, blow up his Twitter handle.
[246.12 → 249.12] I don't know if you guys heard that, but apparently, if people want the shirt...
[249.12 → 253.12] There. Self bro fist. We only need one bro.
[253.12 → 254.12] That's just depressing.
[254.12 → 258.12] Nope, we only need one bro from now on. That's kinda sad. I feel bad for you.
[258.12 → 262.12] You just lost your job. Yeah, get rest.
[262.12 → 264.12] I'm still here.
[264.12 → 266.12] Uh, yes.
[266.12 → 271.12] Anyway, so I guess we should talk about the graphics card.
[271.12 → 277.12] Yeah, so back to that graphics card that we've talked about sort of one and a half times already.
[277.12 → 280.12] Um, this rumour actually kinda makes sense.
[280.12 → 281.12] Yeah.
[281.12 → 284.12] So, they're saying it's going to have a 384-bit memory bus,
[284.12 → 288.12] approximately 50% boost in performance over the GTX Titan Black,
[288.12 → 292.12] and that it'll have double the performance per watt of the GK110,
[292.12 → 296.12] which powered the 780, 780 Ti, Titan, and Titan Black.
[296.12 → 302.12] So this all actually makes a great deal of sense, and is in line with NVIDIA's usual strategy of one big core,
[302.12 → 308.12] a medium-sized core, which we can tell just by looking at GM204, that's what that is.
[308.12 → 309.12] Yeah.
[309.12 → 311.12] That's not the top tier card.
[311.12 → 314.12] And, uh, or at least the eventual top tier Maxwell card.
[314.12 → 316.12] And then the trickle down keeps on going from there.
[316.12 → 319.12] So, um, I don't know.
[319.12 → 320.12] I've...
[320.12 → 325.12] The one thing that we're both not entirely sure about is the Q4 2014 launch date.
[325.12 → 328.12] Or, or they're saying it should be within two months.
[328.12 → 330.12] That sounds a little bit extreme, maybe.
[330.12 → 336.12] Yeah, and I mean, if that happens, it'll be a compute card, like a Tesla, or a, um, or maybe even a Squadron.
[336.12 → 337.12] Maybe.
[337.12 → 339.12] Not a consumer-grade card.
[339.12 → 340.12] I don't think so.
[340.12 → 341.12] Um, although, I mean, who knows?
[341.12 → 342.12] Maybe, uh, maybe I'm wrong.
[342.12 → 343.12] Maybe it'll be Titan 2.
[343.12 → 344.12] Or something like that.
[344.12 → 345.12] Yeah.
[345.12 → 346.12] Could be possible.
[346.12 → 349.12] Alright, moving on to our next, also NVIDIA-related news.
[349.12 → 350.12] Kingpin...
[350.12 → 351.12] Oh, sorry.
[351.12 → 354.12] That first one was originally posted on the forum by Big Strong.
[354.12 → 355.12] Big Strong.
[355.12 → 356.12] Thank you for that.
[356.12 → 358.12] I don't know if it's Strong, or like SRO...
[358.12 → 359.12] OOO-NZZ.
[359.12 → 361.12] No one's really sure.
[361.12 → 363.12] That's the thing about online handles is...
[363.12 → 366.12] Like, are capitals emphasis, or...?
[366.12 → 370.12] How can you ever really get a handle on something that's just digital data?
[373.12 → 378.12] Well, could grabbing a hard drive be getting a handle on digital data?
[378.12 → 381.12] Or an SSD.
[381.12 → 384.12] Because you're technically holding it.
[384.12 → 388.42] I think this might be the longest silence we've ever had on the WAN show.
[389.46 → 391.62] I basically talk constantly, don't I?
[391.72 → 392.34] Didn't we have it?
[392.42 → 395.52] No, because I think we had like a one-minute silence for something.
[395.80 → 396.16] Did we?
[396.36 → 397.70] I think there was, yeah.
[397.76 → 402.38] Whatever it was, it was probably something inappropriate and not something that actually deserved a one-minute silence.
[402.60 → 403.00] 100%.
[403.00 → 404.06] I think so.
[404.22 → 406.30] I don't remember what it was, but it didn't make a ton of sense.
[406.30 → 408.32] But we had a minute silence for it.
[408.48 → 409.66] Seems like the kind of thing I would do.
[409.66 → 416.80] All right, so Mech777 posted on the forum that, quote unquote, Maxwell is an overclocking monster.
[417.00 → 420.84] Kingpin and Tin have cracked 2 gigahertz plus.
[420.98 → 421.84] This was on LN2.
[422.56 → 422.94] Yeah.
[423.40 → 428.84] I mean, to be clear, you won't be cracking 2 gigahertz plus unless you cool with liquid nitrogen.
[429.38 → 431.16] But got any more details while I...
[431.16 → 435.56] They're running their core at 2103 megahertz and their memory at 1753.
[436.02 → 438.54] So all of that is just generally insane.
[438.54 → 441.88] Again, though, LN2, liquid nitrogen.
[442.28 → 445.84] They got a Fire strike score of 1940.
[446.54 → 447.74] And they got a Fire strike...
[447.74 → 449.14] 19,040.
[449.30 → 449.96] Yeah, my bad.
[450.08 → 453.04] And they got a Fire strike extreme score of 9191.
[454.06 → 455.24] Absolutely ridiculous.
[456.32 → 459.32] Apparently, the overclock was attributed to low power consumption.
[460.00 → 460.80] Yeah, low power consumption.
[460.94 → 463.84] I mean, also any of the other optimizations that NVIDIA has made in Maxwell.
[463.84 → 471.52] There's a lot of stuff that's still under the hood with Maxwell that I think they're either waiting for the bigger core to reveal.
[471.86 → 473.36] I mean, that's what they do.
[473.44 → 476.70] They tend to kind of pace the releases of their news.
[477.18 → 477.84] Speaking of...
[477.84 → 478.94] That's why competition's good.
[478.94 → 484.18] Because if there isn't a ton of competition, that pace can go at whatever speed they want.
[484.40 → 489.06] And if they're like, well, if we develop slower, then we don't have to spend as much on R&D.
[489.22 → 490.30] And they just slow the pace down.
[490.78 → 492.30] Well, I don't think they're doing that.
[492.46 → 492.78] Me neither.
[492.94 → 495.22] I'm saying just in general, that's why competition's good.
[495.22 → 500.80] I think it's just the way that the R&D is being directed these days.
[501.66 → 507.62] Where they still have to continue to develop and stay competitive in HPC, for example.
[507.76 → 511.76] So they still want to pump better GPU cores as fast as possible.
[512.00 → 514.58] We just might end up with ones that are more compute optimized.
[515.14 → 517.16] And this has been happening over the last few years.
[517.34 → 520.22] That also happened to be fantastic for gaming as well.
[520.46 → 520.54] Yeah.
[520.54 → 521.58] But...
[521.58 → 521.90] Okay.
[522.08 → 524.20] Now, that's a lot of good NVIDIA news.
[524.34 → 527.64] But I have some very unfortunate NVIDIA news as well.
[527.74 → 529.48] This is something that's not actually on the dock.
[529.74 → 531.68] And I noticed...
[531.68 → 533.74] And I had someone assure me that it wasn't a big deal.
[533.84 → 535.12] But I was pretty sure it was a big deal.
[535.22 → 541.38] I noticed at their editor's day that the PCs were running with Shield controllers plugged into them.
[541.76 → 542.42] And I was like, oh yeah.
[542.46 → 543.98] I thought that wasn't PC compatible.
[544.24 → 544.98] At least not yet.
[545.06 → 547.92] And so it has been confirmed by NVIDIA that it wasn't.
[547.92 → 554.02] And the version of GeForce Experience and the latest driver that came out with GTX 780...
[554.02 → 555.08] 980, rather.
[555.52 → 558.76] Now supports Shield as a controller on your PC.
[559.06 → 559.34] Which is...
[559.34 → 560.34] Or Shield controller.
[560.76 → 561.28] Not Shield.
[561.60 → 561.82] So your Shield controller.
[561.82 → 565.84] It's terrifying when someone says that there's bad news and then proceeds to only give you good news.
[566.22 → 566.48] Oh yeah.
[566.54 → 567.34] The bad news is coming.
[567.74 → 569.80] So the unfortunate thing...
[569.80 → 571.68] And this is only moderately bad news...
[571.68 → 574.62] Is that it doesn't work wirelessly on your computer.
[574.62 → 580.54] And that makes sense because it's Wi-Fi Direct and to my knowledge, nothing Wi-Fi Direct connects directly to your computer yet.
[580.58 → 581.22] That's as far as I know.
[581.86 → 584.62] The much worse news is...
[585.18 → 585.96] Where is it?
[586.84 → 587.28] Compatibility.
[588.18 → 588.64] Okay.
[588.76 → 590.12] Android devices, etc.
[590.88 → 591.28] Okay.
[591.74 → 594.10] It only works on their own Android devices, which I kind of get.
[594.34 → 595.90] Again, Wi-Fi Direct, whatever.
[596.34 → 597.28] Games controllers.
[597.28 → 601.42] Can I use the Shield wireless controller with a PC?
[602.48 → 602.76] Yes.
[602.98 → 611.38] The Shield wireless controller is compatible as a wired controller with Windows 7 or Windows 8 running GeForce Experience.
[613.46 → 614.02] Wow.
[614.92 → 622.70] So just for giggles, I tried to install GeForce Experience on a computer that wasn't running a GeForce graphics card.
[623.12 → 625.40] It goes no supported hardware and boots you out.
[625.40 → 633.04] So the only way to install the driver for NVIDIA's game controller is to have an NVIDIA graphics card in your system.
[633.22 → 635.20] This is extremely offensive to me.
[635.22 → 636.80] And I think if you install...
[636.80 → 640.64] Just judging from graphics card overclocking and testing...
[640.64 → 645.02] If you install GeForce Experience with an NVIDIA card plugged in and then swap, it just won't run.
[645.26 → 645.60] That's right.
[645.98 → 646.14] Yeah.
[646.14 → 648.92] So this is incredibly disappointing to me.
[648.96 → 655.56] I don't understand why NVIDIA wouldn't want anyone to enjoy the experience of using their controller.
[656.06 → 658.78] I reached out to them for comment two days ago.
[658.90 → 662.34] I gave them two days to reply to my message about this.
[662.82 → 664.42] And I was like, what's going on?
[664.48 → 664.56] Yeah.
[664.60 → 666.48] I was going to say, they might have just overlooked it.
[666.56 → 668.68] They might have just bundled it into the GeForce Experience driver.
[668.68 → 672.96] So we will update you guys next week on WAN Show if we hear back anything else.
[673.04 → 675.20] Or I'll try to tweet it out when I hear back about it.
[675.28 → 678.66] But for now, you can't just install a driver.
[678.80 → 682.16] And to my knowledge, there's nothing about the controller that would make it not work.
[682.24 → 685.06] Like maybe the touchpad might not work or something.
[685.42 → 688.76] If you didn't have GeForce Experience, it should just work as a standard controller.
[688.78 → 690.68] Why would GeForce Experience affect the touchpad?
[690.84 → 691.94] Well, I don't know.
[692.18 → 694.88] Like it might be some kind of emulated mouse something.
[695.06 → 696.46] But then that should be able to just be in a driver.
[696.46 → 698.16] You would think that.
[698.34 → 701.50] But I can see why that might take longer to implement, for example.
[701.80 → 705.76] Because the rest of the way the controller works is exactly like a standard Xbox controller.
[705.86 → 709.90] Yeah, I just don't see what GeForce Experience does that would have anything to affect the touchpad.
[710.04 → 714.42] So it would be implementing the driver through GeForce Experience or implementing the driver through standalone.
[714.64 → 715.34] Or not.
[715.48 → 720.54] Because they do some funny stuff with things like mouse control over shield and stuff like that.
[720.60 → 722.62] It depends on how it was implemented.
[723.08 → 723.92] So I don't know.
[724.44 → 725.46] I'm just saying I don't know.
[725.46 → 727.98] I'm not saying that definitely it wouldn't work.
[728.14 → 728.50] Whatever.
[728.76 → 731.78] The point is that it should at least work as a controller.
[732.84 → 733.50] That's it.
[733.88 → 738.10] And the fact that they are not allowing it to do that is just super crappy.
[738.58 → 740.70] I mean, imagine this for a second.
[741.06 → 746.26] Let's say someone who wants to use, oh, I don't know, Steam in Home Streaming on an Ultrabook.
[746.26 → 751.98] And happens to have a GeForce powered gaming machine elsewhere in their house.
[751.98 → 753.12] And thinks, oh, great.
[753.16 → 754.06] I'll just use my controller.
[754.18 → 755.88] I'll plug it into my notebook.
[755.88 → 759.56] And then I'll stream to myself from my freaking GeForce PC.
[759.88 → 761.02] That will not work.
[761.34 → 763.36] And that is a huge oversight from NVIDIA.
[763.44 → 764.62] I'm extremely upset about it.
[764.98 → 768.64] I just think this is locking things away for the sake of locking them away.
[768.64 → 773.18] As opposed to for the sake of maintaining the end user's experience.
[773.18 → 776.94] Which is what I do believe they do a lot of the time.
[777.38 → 786.02] Unfortunately, this is evidence that not everything that they do is necessarily for the sake of making sure the end user has a good experience.
[786.02 → 787.56] Because this is not a good experience.
[788.20 → 789.32] And there's no reason for it.
[789.32 → 791.64] Again, they could have possibly just...
[791.64 → 792.78] There could possibly be a reason.
[792.98 → 794.28] We will update you if there's a reason.
[794.44 → 795.38] I haven't heard back yet.
[795.94 → 797.60] I more thought of it as an oversight.
[798.88 → 799.96] But we will see.
[800.50 → 801.74] So there you go.
[803.70 → 804.10] Okay.
[804.42 → 806.44] We said we would pull them in at around five.
[806.56 → 806.90] Did we?
[806.90 → 807.44] All right.
[807.60 → 809.46] So let's bring in our guests, shall we?
[809.86 → 812.18] We have Paul, formerly of New egg TV.
[812.50 → 814.68] And Kyle, formerly of New egg TV.
[814.68 → 819.34] Now of Paul's Hardware and Awesome Sauce News.
[819.90 → 821.16] Boy, are they ever ugly.
[821.74 → 822.14] Hey.
[822.52 → 823.82] I think they're extremely aggressive.
[823.94 → 825.94] That's Awesome Sauce Network for you, sir.
[826.22 → 826.50] Awesome.
[826.84 → 828.60] So what, you do more than news now?
[828.70 → 829.32] Is that your thing?
[829.66 → 830.38] Yes, exactly.
[830.50 → 833.50] It's a bit more all-encompassing than the news tagline.
[833.76 → 835.08] All-encompassing, you say.
[835.14 → 836.10] What do you encompass?
[836.10 → 837.04] By the way, okay.
[837.16 → 839.36] So for those of you who aren't familiar with these jokers,
[839.76 → 842.72] we've got Kyle right here and Paul right here.
[842.78 → 844.32] And they will be living between us.
[845.20 → 846.50] I swear I'll never be a place to be.
[848.46 → 850.90] I don't know why I signed up for this, really.
[851.36 → 853.16] And they'll be completely replacing Luke.
[853.26 → 853.42] Yeah.
[853.48 → 854.56] Oh, did you notice the shirts?
[856.02 → 857.42] We joined in on a fun.
[857.84 → 858.00] Yeah.
[858.48 → 860.40] I actually have been wearing this all day.
[860.56 → 863.40] I didn't even know that anything was going on with your team trolling you.
[863.48 → 864.52] This is just pure coincidence.
[864.52 → 865.64] So it must be.
[865.72 → 866.18] It must be.
[866.54 → 871.66] And then he got here right as you guys were revealing that you all had the shirts on.
[871.74 → 873.14] I was like, oh, I've got one too.
[873.14 → 876.08] This is how Paul answered the door five minutes ago when I rolled to his house.
[876.14 → 876.56] He opens the door.
[876.62 → 877.40] He's like, he looks at me.
[877.46 → 878.82] He's like, I have to change my clothes.
[878.98 → 879.52] I'm like, what?
[879.62 → 880.90] What's happening over there?
[881.32 → 881.96] You do shit.
[882.76 → 883.80] It's very, very important.
[883.86 → 884.70] Thank you guys for having us.
[884.76 → 885.00] Yes.
[885.06 → 885.44] Thank you.
[885.62 → 886.20] Thank you very much.
[886.20 → 888.94] Oh, apparently you guys are pretty loud.
[889.02 → 889.56] Hold on a second.
[889.64 → 891.12] I'm going to turn you all down a little bit.
[891.42 → 892.56] Maybe I'll just turn you down all the way.
[892.56 → 893.58] You guys are so influential.
[893.72 → 894.58] He just said you all.
[895.30 → 895.72] All right.
[896.08 → 896.44] Let's.
[896.44 → 898.12] At least I don't dislike you guys that much.
[898.26 → 899.38] Let's hear from people.
[899.52 → 901.70] Let's see if that sounds okay.
[902.26 → 903.94] You guys are also peaking a little bit.
[904.04 → 907.84] So I'm not sure if that's a microphone setting or whatever else, but hopefully we're all good.
[908.56 → 909.90] Apparently the stream died.
[910.20 → 911.94] So I don't know what's up with that.
[912.06 → 913.82] It doesn't look like it's dead on our side.
[913.96 → 917.96] So we're going to continue sort of trucking along here.
[917.96 → 919.10] Hey, let's send up for a second.
[919.30 → 921.22] Why don't you push the mic a little further away?
[921.32 → 922.14] Yeah, that could help too.
[922.52 → 925.98] Yeah, we dropped a few frames, but it looks like we are definitely back here.
[925.98 → 926.66] So, all right.
[928.00 → 930.54] What the heck is going on over there?
[931.56 → 932.32] Oh, you know.
[932.50 → 933.06] Just in general.
[933.06 → 934.38] A little of this, a little of that.
[935.48 → 936.40] Hashtag Newgate.
[936.90 → 937.32] What heck?
[937.60 → 939.92] So, yeah.
[940.06 → 947.96] I guess if you guys aren't familiar with like New egg TV, that's what Kyle and I have been doing for quite a few years now.
[948.44 → 952.30] Kind of regular presenters on the New egg TV YouTube channel.
[953.00 → 959.30] Kyle does a little bit more behind the scenes than I do, but kind of similar to what Linus used to do with NCI.
[960.30 → 960.50] Right.
[960.50 → 972.66] And we have just recently both sort of independently, and then we both kind of found out that we were both kind of on the same page, made the decision that we were going to go our separate ways and leave New egg.
[973.02 → 978.80] We still have a setup there, so we are still, we're not going to be gone completely.
[978.92 → 980.78] We're still going to be participating a little bit over there.
[980.78 → 986.86] Kyle was just over there today, and he did the Alt-Tab live show that is also on Twitch.
[987.46 → 987.64] Right.
[987.98 → 988.86] That was good times.
[989.40 → 989.66] Yes.
[990.00 → 990.24] Yes.
[990.24 → 992.80] So, you guys are going independent.
[992.96 → 996.10] Do you feel a little bit like, oh, I don't know, copycats?
[997.88 → 998.24] Copycats.
[998.52 → 1001.86] I was going to say, was it Logan?
[1002.10 → 1002.52] Didn't Logan?
[1002.52 → 1003.32] I was just going to say.
[1003.68 → 1004.02] You can't lose to that.
[1004.02 → 1008.12] Because I've seen a lot of people say, hey, everyone's, they've been saying we're pulling like a Jerry.
[1008.12 → 1014.62] Like, because Jerry is the most recent person to leave his job to some degree.
[1015.32 → 1018.02] But I got to go back to Logan.
[1018.18 → 1021.82] I feel like Logan kind of set the bar for all of us on that one.
[1021.90 → 1022.40] Yeah, exactly.
[1022.72 → 1024.58] At the end of the day, we're all copying someone.
[1024.74 → 1025.80] It might as well be Logan, right?
[1026.14 → 1026.50] Exactly.
[1027.12 → 1033.20] But it's just kind of interesting how this huge transition for both Paul and I kind of started at the same time.
[1033.20 → 1039.32] And I think it was kind of for the best that it happened at the same time as opposed to spreading it out.
[1039.68 → 1041.88] Like having one big announcement at the company.
[1042.42 → 1044.04] And then a month later, somebody else is leaving.
[1044.64 → 1045.96] So, we kind of just talked about it.
[1046.02 → 1047.98] It was like, hey, so, Paul, I'm planning this.
[1048.00 → 1048.46] And he's like, really?
[1048.66 → 1049.60] I'm kind of planning this.
[1049.68 → 1050.36] And we're like, oh, wow.
[1050.46 → 1051.18] It's kind of funny.
[1051.24 → 1052.20] Why don't we do it together or whatever?
[1052.54 → 1054.64] So, it kind of worked out that way.
[1055.06 → 1058.12] And, you know, but still much love to New egg.
[1058.32 → 1059.22] They've helped me a lot.
[1059.44 → 1061.96] That was literally my first job straight out of college.
[1061.96 → 1063.84] They're the only people who would take me.
[1064.32 → 1065.74] I don't blame them.
[1065.88 → 1066.02] Oh.
[1067.42 → 1071.32] But we had a few other choices.
[1072.18 → 1072.50] Yes.
[1072.72 → 1075.02] But they didn't work out.
[1076.76 → 1076.96] Yeah.
[1077.38 → 1078.72] That was so ominous.
[1079.78 → 1081.10] Looks off into the distance.
[1081.20 → 1082.06] I wasn't sure where he was.
[1082.84 → 1084.42] Discretion isn't really Paul's specialty.
[1085.00 → 1085.22] Yeah.
[1085.36 → 1085.78] It didn't work out.
[1085.86 → 1090.60] But, yeah, at the end of the day, going independent is, I think, a good decision for both of us.
[1090.60 → 1092.42] I know I'm really excited.
[1092.74 → 1097.78] This last week, I've just been, you know, waking up at 9 as opposed to 7, which is always awesome.
[1098.58 → 1099.22] Working hard.
[1099.34 → 1104.06] And the ability, straight up the ability, because before, I would work 40 hours a week at New egg.
[1104.10 → 1107.56] I would come home around 5.30:6 p.m., have dinner, take a shower.
[1107.64 → 1112.02] By the time I'm ready to actually start a video for my personal channel, it's like 9 o'clock.
[1112.02 → 1115.40] And I'm up until 3 a.m. and got to wake up at 7.30 the next morning.
[1115.48 → 1118.04] It's just, it's a mind whirl.
[1118.26 → 1126.96] So being able to wake up, write a script, and conceptualize a video, and shoot and edit that video and post it all on the same day is amazing.
[1127.46 → 1134.30] It's probably, it's a great feeling to have, which I'm sure you guys are in that sort of same workflow for your channel.
[1134.30 → 1142.06] So speaking of, you know, waking up and conceptualizing a video and then, you know, producing it and all that stuff,
[1142.38 → 1147.34] have you guys actually, have you guys made much content since you've gone independent?
[1147.48 → 1150.64] And how is this going to affect the type of content that you're creating?
[1151.98 → 1152.96] Kyle has.
[1153.46 → 1154.76] I have not yet.
[1154.90 → 1159.96] So I was trying to get to finish off a video last night, and I didn't.
[1159.96 → 1164.66] So that's still, I'm going to post, there'll be a new video on my channel this evening.
[1165.00 → 1165.66] I promise.
[1166.54 → 1167.72] 95% of the way.
[1168.76 → 1170.52] How are you guys planning to support yourselves?
[1170.64 → 1179.18] I mean, I think that you don't have to explain to me that, you know, Google AdSense is not necessarily the white knight and saviour
[1179.18 → 1184.24] that people who watch but don't necessarily create the content might believe it is.
[1185.54 → 1186.20] What's your plan?
[1186.20 → 1186.40] That's true.
[1186.88 → 1191.70] We're nowhere near, neither of us are anywhere near being able to support ourselves on just the AdSense revenue.
[1192.70 → 1199.48] I think, as you probably know, part of the nature of kind of the content that we do, since we cover technology,
[1199.66 → 1204.46] we cover products that are brought to market and sold to people and that companies make profit from.
[1204.46 → 1212.30] So as a result of that, we have the possibility to do things like pre-roll type ads, those things that you've done.
[1212.92 → 1219.72] I mean, obviously, there's, you got to kind of, especially when it's for your own channel versus working for a separate company,
[1219.88 → 1224.26] you got to kind of take a step back and think, okay, if I'm going to do something like this, how am I going to do it?
[1224.48 → 1228.60] How am I going to make it as non-intrusive for anyone who's watching my channel as possible?
[1228.60 → 1232.20] We'll also give companies a chance to, you know, promote their products if they want to.
[1232.88 → 1241.18] So I think I might be doing some basic, simple, you know, like five to ten second pre-roll ads in the near future.
[1241.18 → 1252.90] And then I might actually be doing some writing for some websites that do content of the technical nature, I guess.
[1253.50 → 1255.66] So big! We want more information!
[1256.26 → 1262.00] I know, none of this stuff is set in stone yet, so I don't want to say, like, yes, I'm going to be doing this until I know for sure.
[1262.04 → 1263.50] I was like one big striptease.
[1263.88 → 1264.16] Yes.
[1264.58 → 1265.46] Wanting more at the end.
[1265.54 → 1265.90] That's it.
[1266.04 → 1266.96] That's our seduction.
[1267.22 → 1270.42] But you guys are also still going to be doing some stuff with New Egg, correct?
[1270.42 → 1271.30] Yes.
[1271.72 → 1271.90] Yeah.
[1272.08 → 1278.88] So the plan right now is that we're each going to go in one day a week and help out with whatever the regular content is.
[1278.94 → 1281.38] And we might be doing some additional videos here and there as well.
[1281.82 → 1290.86] So the Yolked show, which is kind of tech news and us messing around, which is kind of fun, the Alt-Tab live show, are the main ones right now.
[1291.02 → 1296.60] And then, you know, obviously the team over there is going through some transition right now at the same time.
[1296.60 → 1304.82] So we need to sort of also wait and see and say, okay, we've taken a step back from any kind of leadership role that we might have played before.
[1304.98 → 1308.18] So what do they want to do next, and how can we play a part in that?
[1308.80 → 1309.34] So, yeah.
[1309.70 → 1312.34] And that's the main thing I think that we wanted to communicate to people.
[1312.86 → 1324.54] While this is a pretty huge change for both of us personally and possibly, I guess, also a decent change for the New Egg channel as well, this was not done out of animosity towards New Egg or anything.
[1324.54 → 1325.70] Anything to that effect.
[1326.62 → 1330.26] I'm still going to be ordering stuff there all the time because I can drive over to Local.
[1331.00 → 1335.66] And, yeah, so there's no, like, major problems or anything like that.
[1335.70 → 1339.28] It was just something both of us kind of came to realize.
[1339.40 → 1341.82] I think Kyle had some other personal family reasons.
[1341.82 → 1359.66] And then for me, I mean, if you work for somewhere for an extended period of time, as great as it might be at some point, you just need to decide, okay, I need to stretch myself and reach out and try to do something that's a little bit more different or that allows me to, I don't know, like Kyle was saying earlier, the creativity.
[1359.92 → 1360.24] Fly.
[1360.36 → 1361.20] Fly away, little bird.
[1361.88 → 1365.86] I was stretching myself and putting my arm around you, and then you just abandoned me.
[1366.30 → 1366.80] Gosh.
[1367.66 → 1369.86] Is that the tape that you used to cover that?
[1369.88 → 1372.12] That's a giant massive waste of electrical tape.
[1372.66 → 1373.98] You got to let that bad boy shine.
[1374.28 → 1376.22] Actually, much more expensive gaff tape.
[1377.10 → 1377.82] Oh, God.
[1377.90 → 1378.34] That's a sin.
[1378.34 → 1378.92] That's good stuff.
[1378.92 → 1383.72] So I hate to do this to you guys, but Skype's using up about 20% of our CPU right now,
[1383.72 → 1387.56] and our stream is lagging to crap because we're at 100% CPU usage.
[1388.10 → 1392.58] So I'm actually going to have to say thank you guys so much for coming on,
[1392.78 → 1396.36] but it's kind of not working for us, unfortunately.
[1396.94 → 1398.62] This relationship isn't going to be able to continue.
[1399.04 → 1403.08] So we'll come on, hopefully, in a future episode or something like that.
[1403.32 → 1407.98] We're going to upgrade our CPU, and we'll have you guys on again to just kind of be regular guests.
[1407.98 → 1412.72] I think it's great that you came on for the announcement, but I think I have to let you go.
[1412.84 → 1417.20] So thank you guys. Again, I'm very sorry. Nothing personal, except that I hate you.
[1417.80 → 1419.94] No worries. Of course. We love you guys.
[1419.96 → 1423.30] I thought Cal was trying to direct people to his Amazon link instead of yours.
[1423.78 → 1425.22] No, actually. Wow.
[1425.66 → 1428.80] I'm not. Watch my last video. Go to my channel and watch it.
[1428.84 → 1433.52] I specifically say, if you don't already have Linus' bookmarks, don't leave mine.
[1433.88 → 1437.36] And now he's desperately trying to plead for views.
[1437.36 → 1439.14] He wants me to go watch his video.
[1439.24 → 1440.50] Go to my video.
[1440.64 → 1441.42] Please watch my video.
[1441.44 → 1443.48] I need that one more incremental count.
[1443.84 → 1445.22] All right. We'll see you guys later.
[1445.68 → 1445.86] Bye.
[1445.86 → 1447.08] See you later, guys.
[1447.60 → 1448.78] Hopefully that fixes it.
[1448.96 → 1450.34] Yeah, I certainly hope it does.
[1450.82 → 1453.22] So let's go ahead and move that screen region.
[1453.60 → 1455.36] See what happens to our CPU usage now.
[1455.36 → 1456.64] Wow. This computer is not stoked.
[1456.80 → 1457.18] Yeah.
[1457.36 → 1457.80] Boom.
[1457.80 → 1460.64] Okay. So look at that.
[1460.74 → 1466.80] We are way down, and hopefully we are actually encoding frames instead of dropping them now.
[1466.98 → 1469.74] Welcome back to the show actually functioning.
[1470.18 → 1474.76] Like I said, guys, there wasn't really anything that I could do about it.
[1474.76 → 1478.94] We had about Skype was claiming 20% CPU load.
[1479.00 → 1481.76] It looks like it was actually closer to around 35%.
[1482.36 → 1488.52] So we went from 60% CPU to no CPU left at all.
[1488.90 → 1491.16] And we were pinned at 100%.
[1491.16 → 1491.84] That was brutal.
[1492.20 → 1493.82] So I'm really sorry about that, you guys.
[1493.90 → 1499.06] We will bring Paul and Kyle back on sometime in the near future, hopefully in the next few weeks here.
[1499.06 → 1504.38] And we will dive into some topics together and have that tech chat that I know you guys want to hear.
[1504.82 → 1505.84] And I'm really sorry about that.
[1505.88 → 1507.56] But we got to just move forward with the show.
[1507.66 → 1509.48] We can't have it running like that forever.
[1509.76 → 1511.12] Looks like we're not dropping frames anymore.
[1511.22 → 1511.76] So I think we're good.
[1511.88 → 1512.40] I think we're good.
[1512.46 → 1513.16] I think that fixed it.
[1513.24 → 1513.60] All right.
[1513.78 → 1516.16] So moving on to Bend gate.
[1516.50 → 1519.70] This was originally posted on the Linus Tech Tips forum by Lars Reviews.
[1519.70 → 1522.66] And there's actually a fairly excellent thread.
[1522.78 → 1526.76] If you're not already a member of linusstechtips.com, then you should probably go there.
[1526.76 → 1530.34] Because if we don't have enough members, he'll lose his job again.
[1530.44 → 1531.04] Oh my.
[1531.66 → 1532.02] Wow.
[1532.30 → 1532.56] Yeah.
[1532.68 → 1533.32] Yeah, that's right.
[1533.34 → 1533.94] We don't have enough members?
[1534.30 → 1535.38] I think we have enough members.
[1535.44 → 1535.72] Okay.
[1535.98 → 1538.30] I have the one most important member.
[1540.26 → 1541.50] That's not on the forum, though.
[1541.70 → 1542.14] No, that's true.
[1542.14 → 1544.30] If it was, I think I'd probably have to remove it.
[1545.32 → 1546.88] But I wouldn't delete that thread.
[1547.58 → 1548.40] I would just hide it.
[1548.40 → 1548.74] Yeah.
[1548.90 → 1549.28] Excellent.
[1549.38 → 1550.98] Excellent thread on the forum about it.
[1550.98 → 1559.12] But basically, there are some videos allegedly breaking phones in half made by one of our
[1559.12 → 1563.94] good friends, Lou, over at Unbox Therapy, where because of some...
[1563.94 → 1564.48] They didn't break it in half.
[1565.00 → 1567.20] Well, when something is...
[1567.20 → 1569.26] Okay, not at the halfway point, I guess.
[1571.76 → 1572.28] Yes.
[1572.28 → 1577.80] So the point is, there were some reports of people having iPhone 6 Pluses bending from
[1577.80 → 1579.96] carrying them in their front pockets.
[1580.84 → 1583.44] This kind of started to circulate on the internet.
[1583.78 → 1590.42] And Lou from Unbox Therapy made a video demonstrating how easily the phone could be significantly bent
[1590.42 → 1597.42] and then how the screen would crack, and it would basically become useless once you bent it back to its original flat form.
[1598.18 → 1604.72] This has been the most viral video, I think, on any tech YouTuber's channel ever.
[1605.18 → 1605.58] Probably.
[1605.80 → 1612.42] And Lou posted a screenshot from his YouTube creators app of it at 10 million views.
[1612.52 → 1614.72] I think the morning after he originally posted it.
[1614.78 → 1618.52] This thing went super crazy viral.
[1618.86 → 1619.36] But...
[1619.36 → 1622.24] I think it's like 30 million now or something just for that one video.
[1622.30 → 1625.22] And he's released three on the topic, which are all above a million views.
[1625.42 → 1626.16] Way more.
[1626.26 → 1628.18] And he's been doing bend tests of other things.
[1628.26 → 1631.36] Other people are jumping on the bend test wagon.
[1631.48 → 1635.66] I think I saw NCI post on their Facebook today a motherboard bent over.
[1635.72 → 1636.92] I recognize the board, too.
[1637.00 → 1643.70] It's an X58 board that was a sample that we got, like, ages ago when I used to work there.
[1643.84 → 1644.50] Oh, man.
[1645.68 → 1647.62] People are saying bend to 980, get more views.
[1647.72 → 1649.06] I really don't think that would happen.
[1649.06 → 1650.40] I think people would just call us idiots.
[1650.72 → 1650.92] Yeah.
[1651.16 → 1652.42] And that would be really hard to do.
[1652.68 → 1652.98] Yeah.
[1653.28 → 1656.16] We'd have to put it in a vice and stuff.
[1656.66 → 1658.48] I'd just rather not bend the 980.
[1658.66 → 1662.70] I'd rather people, someone at some point, game on that 980.
[1662.86 → 1663.44] Because that's...
[1663.44 → 1665.72] I don't believe in breaking hardware on purpose.
[1665.72 → 1670.62] I do think particularly the original bend demonstration video was very important.
[1670.84 → 1671.20] Justified.
[1671.50 → 1673.26] Just to make people aware of the issue.
[1673.78 → 1679.26] But along those lines, Apple is claiming now that it isn't actually an issue.
[1679.26 → 1694.20] So they're saying that out of all the, you know, hype surrounding Bend gate, only 9 users have actually come forward to Apple about having broken their or bent their phone through regular use.
[1694.20 → 1705.32] And they are saying that any of the phones that were able to be bent so easily in this manner just must be suffering from some kind of materials defect.
[1705.86 → 1707.72] And it's not a problem with the design of the phone.
[1707.72 → 1710.46] There's a lot of other stuff kind of floating around.
[1710.70 → 1712.14] So this is just kind of funny.
[1712.22 → 1722.60] Apple threw up a job posting for a Q&A sort of position that one of the things listed in the job description was bending testing.
[1722.88 → 1723.40] Was it Ashley?
[1723.88 → 1724.22] Yeah.
[1724.60 → 1726.12] But again, this is...
[1726.12 → 1726.76] You think it was a joke?
[1727.06 → 1730.98] This is stuff that could have just been a regular job posting anyway.
[1731.42 → 1734.06] I don't think it necessarily has anything to do with Bend gate.
[1734.06 → 1737.02] I think really the proof will be in the pudding.
[1737.02 → 1740.66] Are we going to see more people coming forward with bent phones?
[1741.58 → 1745.42] One thing that I've seen Apple fanboys kind of running around saying is,
[1745.54 → 1746.52] Oh, well, it's aluminum.
[1746.78 → 1750.38] So, you know, yeah, it was going to bend.
[1750.60 → 1751.64] Anyway, you know what?
[1751.80 → 1752.92] The one I made is aluminum.
[1753.36 → 1757.74] And I can't bend it.
[1757.84 → 1758.60] I can turn it on.
[1759.38 → 1760.88] Like change the volume.
[1761.18 → 1762.20] But I can't bend the phone.
[1762.80 → 1765.56] Which it did perfectly fine while he was trying to bend it.
[1765.56 → 1767.64] For that matter, the 5S has an aluminum back.
[1767.98 → 1768.68] It's made by Apple.
[1768.78 → 1769.42] It also doesn't bend.
[1770.14 → 1770.34] Yeah.
[1770.34 → 1773.98] I think that's pretty much it.
[1775.18 → 1776.72] There's honestly not that much to say.
[1776.90 → 1778.88] It's a massively over-exhausted topic.
[1779.44 → 1779.72] Yep.
[1780.40 → 1782.70] I don't want to even give it that much more attention.
[1782.92 → 1783.86] One other thing.
[1783.92 → 1788.56] Apple says that the new phones feature steel and titanium inserts to reinforce trust locations.
[1788.56 → 1790.86] And they use the strongest glass in the industry.
[1791.56 → 1793.04] So, okay.
[1793.46 → 1795.76] They didn't use sapphire, which we all thought they were going to use.
[1795.98 → 1796.34] Yeah.
[1797.32 → 1798.32] That was interesting.
[1798.66 → 1800.10] That could have been interesting.
[1800.28 → 1802.10] Because I wonder if that would have helped resist bending.
[1802.60 → 1803.52] I kind of doubt it.
[1803.52 → 1803.80] Probably not.
[1803.80 → 1807.10] I mean, Marcus's video where he has the sapphire crystal glass.
[1807.68 → 1808.26] Oh, that's a good point.
[1808.56 → 1814.58] He kind of, in his first video in particular, I think he unfortunately hadn't seen Corning
[1814.58 → 1816.92] Gorilla Glass 3 off of a phone before.
[1817.06 → 1817.20] Yeah.
[1817.26 → 1820.26] So he was kind of marvelling at how clear it was and how it flexed and all that.
[1820.48 → 1823.28] But Gorilla Glass 3 behaves in pretty much exactly the same manner.
[1823.28 → 1823.64] Yeah.
[1823.64 → 1826.34] So, aside from the scratch resistance, I don't think.
[1826.62 → 1826.84] Yeah.
[1826.84 → 1829.22] Which wouldn't have actually helped rigidity in any way.
[1829.50 → 1829.90] So, yeah.
[1830.22 → 1830.66] Never mind.
[1831.58 → 1832.06] Moot point.
[1832.98 → 1833.44] So, okay.
[1833.52 → 1834.84] I hadn't heard anything about this.
[1834.90 → 1835.76] What's going on with the cooler?
[1836.38 → 1839.86] The VGA ACX 970 cooler.
[1840.00 → 1840.48] Ah, yes.
[1840.56 → 1842.96] Originally posted on the forum by Devil.
[1843.42 → 1844.22] Thank you, Sean.
[1845.34 → 1845.74] Phys.
[1846.94 → 1847.38] VGA.
[1847.54 → 1849.74] This is Sean's headline here.
[1849.90 → 1855.10] VGA could lose out on quite a bit of money due to trying to cut costs on their GTX 970
[1855.10 → 1856.14] 980 cards.
[1856.14 → 1859.94] The original article is from E-Technics.
[1860.22 → 1866.88] And it's that VGA may have used a cooler from a bigger card to save on manufacturing costs.
[1867.00 → 1872.76] So, there's a picture of a cooler taken off an VGA 900 series card here.
[1873.14 → 1873.96] And I'm going to go ahead.
[1874.02 → 1876.58] I'm going to load that page eventually if I can.
[1876.58 → 1881.12] But in the meantime, why don't we just switch to the no guest view so you guys don't have to wait for it.
[1881.40 → 1883.70] But basically what happened was the bottom.
[1884.36 → 1884.58] Sorry?
[1884.80 → 1885.46] It started working.
[1885.66 → 1886.06] Which did?
[1886.44 → 1886.62] There.
[1887.28 → 1887.86] Oh, no, no, no.
[1887.86 → 1888.18] It didn't.
[1888.56 → 1888.78] What?
[1888.86 → 1890.00] This page is still loading.
[1890.16 → 1890.44] Oh, my bad.
[1890.44 → 1893.28] I just switched back to a page that works like linustechchips.com.
[1893.40 → 1893.80] Oops.
[1894.06 → 1894.42] Hey!
[1895.36 → 1895.90] That's right.
[1895.98 → 1896.40] Get wrecked.
[1896.76 → 1899.40] So, basically, I'll just have to help you guys visualize this.
[1899.46 → 1900.50] There are three heat pipes.
[1901.36 → 1901.94] There we go.
[1902.00 → 1903.06] Do you need to help with your demonstration?
[1903.30 → 1903.44] No.
[1903.44 → 1904.24] Should I be the heat pipes?
[1904.24 → 1905.96] Yeah, you can be the heat pipes.
[1905.96 → 1906.16] Okay.
[1906.16 → 1907.42] So there are three heat pipes.
[1907.42 → 1916.32] And then you can tell from the thermal paste pattern that the GPU core itself is actually only contacting two of them.
[1916.32 → 1919.80] And one of them is not making contact with the GPU core.
[1919.80 → 1930.60] Now, this has led to some speculation that VGA's direct touch cooler will not work very well and could perform significantly worse than if all three heat pipes were making contact.
[1930.60 → 1932.94] There is some truth to this.
[1933.22 → 1936.82] Direct heat pipe touch technology does make a difference.
[1937.02 → 1940.14] And having them all touching the core would probably help.
[1940.28 → 1944.56] But I think people are overestimating how much of a difference that's going to make.
[1944.86 → 1954.68] Remember, the problem with a copper baseplate on anything, let's say a heat sink or, yeah, let's say a heat sink because that would be fairly related.
[1954.68 → 1955.00] Yeah.
[1955.00 → 1973.16] So the problem with having a copper base on a heat sink, the reason that we use heat pipes and vapour chambers instead of just using a flat slab of copper is that copper can't conduct heat away quickly enough in order to provide the best possible cooling once you build a heat sink that's large enough.
[1973.64 → 1976.66] Over short distances, this is not an issue.
[1976.66 → 1990.94] So with the die right next to it right there and those heat pipes being the hottest part of that cooler and that next heat pipe being right next to those other heat pipes that are the hottest part of the cooler, it's going to be working.
[1991.32 → 1992.54] It's going to be doing something.
[1992.74 → 1994.18] Might not be as effective.
[1994.60 → 1998.42] But we're talking, I'd be surprised if the difference is more than a degree or two.
[1999.24 → 2003.24] And in the grand scheme of things, that's not going to be a huge deal.
[2003.36 → 2004.74] Those cars are already running pretty cool.
[2004.74 → 2006.24] They are already running pretty cool.
[2006.24 → 2014.18] Well, that said, you know, is two degrees the difference between one boost state versus another boost state on cards that overclock themselves?
[2015.46 → 2015.90] Maybe.
[2017.00 → 2025.02] But I'd also suspect that having another person sitting in the room watching you game would make as much of a difference because of just the heat from their body.
[2025.08 → 2029.84] And we're already getting like low temps of around 70 on average as far as I've been able to tell with our cards.
[2030.00 → 2031.52] Yeah, with non-reference cards.
[2031.76 → 2032.00] Yeah.
[2032.00 → 2035.16] So there you go.
[2035.24 → 2037.88] That's pretty much, I guess, all I really have to say about that.
[2037.94 → 2040.48] I don't think it's as big of a deal as other people are.
[2040.70 → 2041.80] VGA did respond.
[2042.16 → 2044.84] They said that though, and I hadn't actually seen their response yet.
[2044.90 → 2047.20] This has been added to the doc since the last time I looked at it.
[2047.20 → 2057.96] The way the GTX 970 ACX heat sink was designed is based on the GTX 970 wattage plus an additional 40% cooling headroom on top of it.
[2058.04 → 2061.00] So they're saying about a total of 200 watts.
[2061.00 → 2066.04] Also, we would like to mention that the cooler passed NVIDIA's green light specifications.
[2066.04 → 2081.32] Due to the small contact area of that GPU, because it has a small die size, we intended for the GPU to contact two major heat pipes with direct touch to get the best heat dissipation out of it without any other material in between them.
[2081.32 → 2084.24] Um, blah, blah, blah, etc, etc, etc.
[2084.24 → 2087.02] Regarding fan noise, this is not a fan noise issue.
[2087.20 → 2088.16] It's more, oh, okay.
[2088.22 → 2093.02] Regarding fan noise, we understood that some had expressed concerns over the fan noise of each VGA's GTX 970 cards.
[2093.38 → 2097.90] This is not a fan noise issue, but more of an aggressive fan curve set by the default BIOS.
[2097.90 → 2099.40] Regardless, we have heard your concerns.
[2099.50 → 2104.66] We are going to provide a BIOS update that keeps the cards quieter and ramps up less aggressively.
[2104.98 → 2111.28] With that said, you can control GPU fan speeds and software, so if you don't want to wait for the BIOS update, then I would say...
[2111.28 → 2112.14] Fairly simple to do.
[2112.64 → 2113.52] Go for it.
[2113.60 → 2115.02] Especially with their...
[2115.02 → 2115.68] Are you talking?
[2116.38 → 2117.46] Have you forgotten you're dead to me?
[2118.28 → 2119.50] What's the name of their software again?
[2120.24 → 2121.02] Uh, Precision X.
[2121.02 → 2123.96] Precision X has pretty good fan curve stuff in it.
[2123.96 → 2126.22] So if you want to change it, use their own software.
[2126.66 → 2127.70] Not too hard.
[2128.38 → 2131.28] The Verge wrote a pretty hilarious, I guess.
[2131.38 → 2133.66] I made it about two-thirds of the way through, and then I got kind of bored.
[2133.84 → 2134.74] But it was pretty funny while I was reading it.
[2134.74 → 2135.60] It can't be that hilarious.
[2135.74 → 2136.60] No, it was pretty funny.
[2136.88 → 2141.26] They wrote a pretty hilarious piece on the fact that the next...
[2141.26 → 2142.00] Well, they...
[2142.00 → 2142.62] Okay, apparently.
[2143.02 → 2147.74] The fact that the next Nexus tablet will be made by HTC.
[2147.98 → 2152.28] And the Verge's article was full of, you know, lovers quarrels and all this kind of stuff.
[2152.28 → 2156.76] The main characters are, of course, Google, HTC, Tam tongue, LG.
[2156.76 → 2157.68] So is it like a triangle?
[2157.78 → 2157.98] No.
[2158.22 → 2160.24] Yeah, just kind of the industry.
[2160.36 → 2161.26] The Android ecosystem.
[2161.62 → 2162.56] All the different players.
[2162.64 → 2163.12] It was pretty funny.
[2163.56 → 2164.76] But basically, that's it.
[2164.80 → 2167.06] This was posted by Method on the forum.
[2167.16 → 2169.62] And the original source here is Reuters.com.
[2169.62 → 2176.64] And apparently, Google has selected HTC for an upcoming 9-inch Nexus tablet.
[2176.82 → 2177.82] So it looks like they're splitting.
[2177.98 → 2179.30] They're using HTC for the tablet.
[2179.40 → 2182.76] And I believe they're using Motor, Motorola still, for their phone.
[2182.92 → 2183.98] Is that confirmed?
[2184.14 → 2187.10] Or are we speculating based on that it looks like the Moto X?
[2187.10 → 2187.84] I think it's speculating.
[2187.84 → 2188.80] The new gen Moto X.
[2188.96 → 2189.10] Right.
[2189.58 → 2191.90] But it has, like, the circular flash.
[2191.96 → 2194.06] And it has all this stuff which is very similar to the Moto X.
[2194.06 → 2194.36] Yes.
[2194.54 → 2195.68] It does look very similar.
[2196.06 → 2197.20] Again, it's still speculation.
[2197.66 → 2198.86] But it's, I don't know.
[2198.94 → 2200.50] It'll be interesting using two different manufacturers.
[2200.50 → 2206.84] So Google has been mulling HTC as a potential partner since last year.
[2207.14 → 2210.18] HTC hasn't made a tablet since 2011.
[2210.82 → 2213.50] So this was announced at Google I.O. in June.
[2213.60 → 2215.08] It's expected Q3 2014.
[2215.80 → 2222.64] And it will apparently be powered by the Terra K1, which is perfect news.
[2222.78 → 2222.86] Yeah.
[2223.06 → 2226.48] Because something that I noticed, I don't know if other people noticed,
[2226.48 → 2231.52] but Nantes had a great article on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus' performance.
[2232.32 → 2237.84] And of all the Android devices that were in the performance charts,
[2238.08 → 2243.74] the one that really hung with the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus was the NVIDIA Shield tablet,
[2244.24 → 2246.16] which is based on the Terra K1.
[2246.36 → 2246.52] Yeah.
[2246.96 → 2248.62] And that's in terms of CPU.
[2248.90 → 2251.26] In terms of GPU, the K1 blew away everything.
[2251.34 → 2251.56] Yeah.
[2251.74 → 2254.16] Just absolutely demolished everything else.
[2254.24 → 2254.60] NVIDIA.
[2254.60 → 2256.92] So I'm excited about that.
[2256.98 → 2264.72] The problem with the K1, the big, like I wonder if NVIDIA had hoped that K1 would be suitable for phone use.
[2264.98 → 2270.18] But the problem with the K1 is that the thermals are just not really suitable for that.
[2270.30 → 2273.90] And they're more optimal for tablet use at this time.
[2273.94 → 2277.78] So at least we can have fast Android tablets as fast as the fastest Apple devices.
[2278.34 → 2280.68] Just not smartphones yet.
[2280.68 → 2283.82] I'm also not surprised that the K1 is heavily focused on GPU.
[2285.22 → 2285.64] I am.
[2286.44 → 2286.74] Why?
[2287.24 → 2287.66] NVIDIA?
[2288.02 → 2288.26] Yeah.
[2288.42 → 2289.64] I mean, they're all about...
[2289.64 → 2290.48] Stop trolling.
[2290.88 → 2293.06] You were so genuine with that I am.
[2293.38 → 2294.90] I was like, did I miss something?
[2295.32 → 2296.24] What did I do?
[2296.64 → 2298.18] Holy crap, I said something stupid.
[2298.84 → 2300.46] No, you didn't say anything stupid.
[2300.56 → 2301.78] You just wore something stupid.
[2301.92 → 2302.10] Hey.
[2302.10 → 2303.50] So that's why you're dead to me.
[2303.66 → 2303.98] No.
[2304.76 → 2305.20] Dead to me.
[2305.64 → 2309.46] Speaking of dead to me, Watch Dogs is turning into a franchise.
[2309.78 → 2311.98] They are not dead at all.
[2312.48 → 2314.60] That's a terrible segue.
[2314.80 → 2315.08] I know.
[2315.38 → 2317.82] I could have said a lot of different things about...
[2317.82 → 2321.60] I could have tied dead to me into Watch Dogs and Ubisoft in a lot of different ways.
[2321.90 → 2322.34] Yeah.
[2322.60 → 2322.96] Yeah.
[2323.82 → 2324.46] Let's say...
[2324.46 → 2325.16] You took the hard way.
[2325.16 → 2329.68] Rather than saying that, you know, I missed an opportunity, why don't we say I had restraint?
[2330.04 → 2330.60] There we go.
[2330.82 → 2331.16] You know what?
[2331.18 → 2331.82] I'm down with that.
[2331.82 → 2332.74] Oh, all right.
[2332.74 → 2334.32] Because usually we do the digging thing.
[2334.54 → 2339.68] At any rate, this was originally posted by DLF on the forum.
[2339.78 → 2341.02] I couldn't tell if it was Diff.
[2341.92 → 2343.06] Diff or DLF.
[2343.12 → 2348.14] And the original article is from Computer and Video Games and Ubisoft Montreal's...
[2348.14 → 2349.76] We're just staring at the doc right now.
[2349.76 → 2350.96] Vice President of Creative.
[2351.56 → 2352.24] Of Creative.
[2352.46 → 2352.64] Yes.
[2352.94 → 2353.48] That's a thing.
[2354.26 → 2354.88] Is it?
[2355.18 → 2355.66] Maybe not.
[2356.06 → 2361.22] Anyway, has said that although the game has its flaws, he feels it succeeds in establishing
[2361.22 → 2364.28] a brand and promise for the future.
[2364.44 → 2366.86] That's an awkward way to do that.
[2367.98 → 2369.56] It's flawed, but...
[2369.56 → 2370.46] I'll let you talk now.
[2370.60 → 2372.08] I'm taking off the dead to me thing.
[2372.16 → 2372.88] Aw, yay.
[2373.26 → 2373.44] Okay.
[2373.56 → 2373.88] You can...
[2373.88 → 2376.78] So it's flawed, but you know, we believe in it.
[2376.86 → 2377.54] It'll be okay.
[2377.72 → 2378.00] Well...
[2378.00 → 2381.54] Hopefully we won't completely screw it up next time and then you guys will hopefully like
[2381.54 → 2381.68] it.
[2381.68 → 2384.90] Or we'll just say this, and you'll buy it, and then we'll just keep moving on anyway because
[2384.90 → 2385.40] we're Ubisoft.
[2385.40 → 2386.74] They did make a good point.
[2387.10 → 2391.46] They brought up that Assassin's Creed 1 had a lot of complaints about it and was hardly
[2391.46 → 2391.98] a perfect game.
[2391.98 → 2395.86] That's because they gave it like no budget and cut it off early so they didn't have time
[2395.86 → 2397.24] to develop missions for the rest of the game.
[2397.32 → 2399.50] So they just reused missions from previous parts of the game.
[2399.52 → 2402.90] But the point was that Assassin's Creed 2 sold just fine.
[2403.34 → 2405.60] In spite of the complaints about Assassin's Creed 1.
[2406.16 → 2406.56] Sold.
[2406.56 → 2407.56] Sold.
[2407.56 → 2408.56] Sold.
[2408.56 → 2409.48] It was a great game.
[2409.56 → 2410.52] I loved Assassin's Creed 2.
[2410.60 → 2411.16] It was perfect.
[2411.68 → 2412.56] But yeah.
[2413.36 → 2418.80] And there was very valid complaints about Assassin's Creed 1 which I also liked because you did
[2418.80 → 2422.04] like the first three missions, and you just basically repeated that for the entire rest
[2422.04 → 2422.38] of the game.
[2422.98 → 2423.70] So I don't know.
[2423.80 → 2427.24] If they do the same thing that would be fantastic because that means the next Watch Dogs
[2427.24 → 2427.94] would be perfect.
[2428.08 → 2429.18] Assassin's Creed 2 was great.
[2429.50 → 2434.74] But I don't know because it did look like Watch Dogs got a much larger budget than Assassin's
[2434.74 → 2435.28] Creed 1.
[2435.42 → 2435.90] Oh yeah it did.
[2435.90 → 2437.90] And that was the main problem with Assassin's Creed 1.
[2438.00 → 2439.70] It was the fact that they ran out of budget.
[2440.10 → 2444.76] But I mean the way that the statement was phrased I think is pretty good.
[2444.94 → 2447.62] Where basically he says okay there are flaws.
[2447.62 → 2448.74] They're admitting flaws which is good.
[2448.88 → 2452.26] You know we want to tackle those flaws and surprise players.
[2452.78 → 2458.52] We need to be careful not to change the things people liked and address the things that they
[2458.52 → 2459.64] didn't like.
[2459.96 → 2464.58] And hopefully you know particularly from a PC gamer's perspective that's going to happen
[2464.58 → 2469.12] right starting at the beginning of the development process when the PC gets treated like a priority
[2469.12 → 2471.46] as opposed to not even an afterthought.
[2471.54 → 2472.80] You can't even call it an afterthought.
[2472.88 → 2473.96] That's what's terrible about it.
[2474.10 → 2474.26] Yeah.
[2474.38 → 2477.74] It was with forethought and malice, allegedly.
[2477.74 → 2479.62] That they nerfed it.
[2479.96 → 2481.78] So hopefully we won't see that happen again.
[2481.88 → 2483.74] And Watch Dogs 2 will be...
[2484.36 → 2489.54] The only thing that scares me about this is that we've had Ubisoft tote rah, rah we're going
[2489.54 → 2494.22] to make it better in front of us before and then just completely ignore it when the time
[2494.22 → 2495.16] for action came to be.
[2495.46 → 2495.80] I know.
[2495.80 → 2497.30] So this is great.
[2497.48 → 2499.78] I hope it happens, but I'm not...
[2499.78 → 2501.28] I wouldn't throw any bets in this corner.
[2501.30 → 2502.42] Things can change though.
[2502.56 → 2506.12] I mean I think I brought this up on WAN Show before so I won't talk about it for too long
[2506.12 → 2513.44] but talking to the DirectX lead at Microsoft when he showed up at the NVIDIA event he was like
[2513.44 → 2515.10] yeah we have a different culture now.
[2515.54 → 2521.14] You know like I'm encouraged to be out here talking to journalists and engaging with the community
[2521.14 → 2524.56] about the direction of Direct3D when before it was...
[2524.56 → 2525.18] Very close-knit.
[2525.72 → 2527.06] ...much more cloistered.
[2527.16 → 2527.32] Yeah.
[2527.54 → 2529.40] And so I don't know.
[2529.58 → 2530.14] I basically...
[2530.72 → 2532.22] Because I kind of grilled him a little bit.
[2532.68 → 2536.14] Some things that I knew he wouldn't know, but I just wanted to kind of...
[2536.86 → 2538.80] Someone who might have some influence there.
[2538.92 → 2540.90] Let's just beat him up while he's down.
[2541.00 → 2545.68] And I kind of went man why didn't Halo 1 get multiplayer co-op?
[2546.08 → 2548.54] And he was like I legitimately don't know that.
[2548.54 → 2553.46] And I'm like man why do they keep recommitting to us and then doing this and doing that.
[2553.46 → 2555.28] Why isn't Master Chief Edition not coming to PC?
[2555.44 → 2556.52] What the hell is that?
[2556.56 → 2559.38] So I basically just went man does Microsoft even care?
[2559.86 → 2563.10] And all he could really say was Microsoft is changing.
[2563.72 → 2566.14] And he spoke very earnestly about it.
[2566.34 → 2567.70] He seems like a great guy.
[2567.82 → 2569.98] Mr. Nadella has been making a crazy amount of changes.
[2569.98 → 2571.16] He's not a PR guy.
[2571.68 → 2572.58] He's a technical guy.
[2572.64 → 2573.48] He's a programmer.
[2573.60 → 2574.28] Always cool.
[2574.28 → 2577.10] So I don't expect him to give me a PR response.
[2577.22 → 2582.10] But he seemed genuinely convinced that Microsoft is on a great track and cares about gamers.
[2582.32 → 2586.08] And the other thing he said is that his team has always cared.
[2586.72 → 2589.46] And has always cared about PC gaming.
[2589.46 → 2593.64] From watching the very few amounts of DX announcements and demos that you're able to watch.
[2593.72 → 2595.96] Where those guys are up on stage allowed to talk.
[2596.28 → 2597.76] They do seem like they care a lot.
[2597.78 → 2599.28] Yeah and he was telling me there are guys on his team.
[2599.28 → 2600.30] But there's very few amounts of those.
[2600.30 → 2603.54] Those you know $4,000, $5,000 gaming rigs at home.
[2603.66 → 2606.88] Like these are PC gaming enthusiasts.
[2606.88 → 2607.98] At least some of them.
[2608.04 → 2611.70] And he kind of went you know yeah we're optimistic.
[2612.28 → 2613.42] You know we believe in the future.
[2613.54 → 2614.90] So who knows.
[2615.06 → 2618.64] Maybe Ubisoft who hasn't gotten a new CEO.
[2620.50 → 2622.36] Or really changed at all.
[2625.94 → 2627.54] Hopefully they do those things.
[2627.54 → 2630.36] So speaking of changes.
[2630.54 → 2630.94] Oh damn.
[2631.84 → 2632.56] Corsair.
[2633.54 → 2637.76] Changed the branding on their gaming peripherals.
[2637.90 → 2640.64] And we might have all collectively freaked out a little bit too much.
[2641.04 → 2641.48] Probably.
[2641.66 → 2643.82] But let's just go through the saga here.
[2644.04 → 2647.80] So here's this video they made with like some soldiers.
[2647.96 → 2649.46] This is I think just the outro for it.
[2649.68 → 2650.56] Like have you watched the video?
[2650.78 → 2651.28] No actually.
[2651.32 → 2652.12] It's pretty over the top.
[2652.20 → 2653.88] The production values are like pretty good.
[2654.62 → 2656.52] Like I have no idea how much that cost.
[2656.52 → 2659.12] Just looking at that animation.
[2659.92 → 2660.08] Yeah.
[2660.38 → 2664.38] So they released a new brand for their gaming products.
[2664.60 → 2666.40] Oh I'm not logged in so that's not working.
[2666.54 → 2666.92] Winner.
[2667.40 → 2668.30] Everything is broken.
[2668.48 → 2669.42] Everything is broken.
[2670.88 → 2672.12] Something something something.
[2672.42 → 2673.00] Something.
[2673.38 → 2674.48] Everything is broken.
[2674.48 → 2675.56] All right.
[2675.56 → 2679.66] So they redid their Vengeance branding.
[2679.80 → 2684.82] The old sort of yellow Vengeance logo that we would find on older Corsair gaming products.
[2684.90 → 2688.68] I used to have a keyboard in here, but I took it out of here for a B-roll or something, so I don't have it at the moment.
[2689.24 → 2690.84] And then they redid it.
[2690.84 → 2703.96] So instead of having the Corsair sales and then Vengeance as kind of separate sub brand they created this kind of two cross blade things that ends up looking kind of like a tribal tattoo that would belong on the small of your back.
[2704.18 → 2708.34] Or like a Klingon Ballet with a little heart in the middle of it.
[2708.34 → 2712.52] Like there isn't there aren't really many great ways to look at it.
[2712.60 → 2714.82] I saw a crazy crab holding swords with a heart on his head.
[2715.60 → 2715.90] Yeah.
[2716.32 → 2716.62] Yeah.
[2716.72 → 2718.42] That's that's another that's another way.
[2718.62 → 2720.94] Bad people suggest that it's kind of like a crab-a-rang.
[2721.68 → 2722.08] Yeah.
[2722.18 → 2723.24] So it's a bat-a-rang but.
[2723.96 → 2724.88] But it's a crab.
[2725.20 → 2725.90] That's funny.
[2727.26 → 2728.56] There should be there should be Crabbed Man.
[2730.68 → 2731.16] Yeah.
[2731.46 → 2732.84] That would actually make a great.
[2732.98 → 2736.52] One extremely strong arm and one really not strong one.
[2736.52 → 2739.24] That would make a tremendous like Cartoon Network show.
[2739.64 → 2742.44] It's like Crab Man, and he's just always like an ass to everyone.
[2744.18 → 2745.66] I'll save you, but I won't like it.
[2745.94 → 2746.14] Yeah.
[2746.26 → 2746.42] Yeah.
[2746.58 → 2746.74] Yeah.
[2746.74 → 2746.84] Yeah.
[2746.84 → 2746.98] Yeah.
[2747.24 → 2747.52] Anyway.
[2748.30 → 2750.32] So they took away the sales.
[2750.52 → 2755.06] They took away Corsair Vengeance sub brand, and now it's all unified under Corsair gaming.
[2755.24 → 2760.32] They made a big hubbub about this which I actually wonder if ended up working against them.
[2760.52 → 2762.92] They had press releases PR statements.
[2763.08 → 2764.42] They redid all their packaging.
[2764.42 → 2771.28] They took new products like the RGB series keyboards and packaged them with this new Corsair gaming brand.
[2771.54 → 2775.20] They took existing products like their 1500 headset and 1300 headsets.
[2775.40 → 2778.96] We actually have a bunch of them in the hallway, and they repackaged them under the new branding.
[2779.10 → 2780.86] Redid the industrial design on the products.
[2780.96 → 2783.98] Like this was not a cheap initiative.
[2784.20 → 2784.36] No.
[2784.50 → 2788.18] For Corsair to undergo this rebranding process.
[2788.18 → 2791.46] And then the community freaked out.
[2791.62 → 2795.94] There was a change.org petition which I really feel like was a little over the top.
[2796.04 → 2796.96] I mean change.org.
[2797.10 → 2799.78] I think most change.org petitions are a little bit over the top.
[2799.82 → 2800.00] Okay.
[2800.08 → 2800.48] Fair enough.
[2801.38 → 2802.64] PC Master Race.
[2802.64 → 2805.34] The Subreddit was explosive.
[2805.96 → 2811.00] The threads on Linus Tech Tips are many, many, many posts long discussing this.
[2811.00 → 2819.20] And I think that basically all there really is to say about it is I don't really like the logo either.
[2819.36 → 2819.68] Me neither.
[2819.82 → 2821.24] I released a video about it last night.
[2821.30 → 2822.04] I don't think it's great.
[2822.04 → 2827.72] But something that I actually didn't realize until I was talking to someone at Corsair about the video we made last night.
[2827.92 → 2829.32] Where it's kind of a troll video.
[2829.46 → 2832.64] We show how to mod your keyboard and take the logo off and put something else on.
[2832.94 → 2837.04] I was talking to someone from Corsair and I kind of went yeah realistically I think everyone's going to forget.
[2837.30 → 2843.94] Because it only takes this conversation we're having now for me to remember how much I hated the Vengeance logo.
[2844.50 → 2845.40] When I first saw it.
[2845.70 → 2846.44] And I still hate it.
[2846.48 → 2847.12] I think it's horrible.
[2847.60 → 2848.58] I think that font.
[2848.80 → 2850.62] I think the bright yellow was never good.
[2850.62 → 2852.74] And that's something people are forgetting as well.
[2852.84 → 2854.70] They're upset about the yellow in the gaming logo.
[2854.92 → 2856.26] Vengeance was already yellow branding.
[2857.20 → 2860.38] That said they didn't put Vengeance on the product.
[2861.76 → 2863.22] It was mostly on the box.
[2863.24 → 2863.82] Yeah that's true.
[2863.98 → 2864.74] Which helps a lot.
[2864.82 → 2867.80] But I'm just saying I think that people will kind of forget about it eventually.
[2868.26 → 2868.98] And who knows, maybe.
[2869.34 → 2871.46] I mean Vengeance was only with us a few years.
[2871.56 → 2874.14] Who knows maybe they'll rebrand it again at some point.
[2874.48 → 2877.32] But I think that this was very much an overreaction.
[2877.32 → 2881.08] I think Corsair responded to it in the best way that they possibly could.
[2881.68 → 2882.54] With Yellow Beard's post.
[2882.78 → 2883.80] Yellow Beard's post.
[2884.28 → 2888.32] So K70 RGB keyboards with red switches.
[2888.50 → 2891.70] Cherry MX red switches that already had the original logo.
[2891.94 → 2894.38] Will continue to exist for some time.
[2894.52 → 2897.84] So people who really want the original logo on their keyboard can get it.
[2898.38 → 2900.98] And then the other ones will have the Corsair gaming logo.
[2900.98 → 2902.60] So if you want blue or brown switches.
[2902.86 → 2904.28] A K65 or a K95.
[2904.54 → 2906.44] The 10 keyless and the one with macro keys.
[2906.70 → 2908.52] Then you'll have to have the new logo.
[2908.72 → 2910.56] And honestly if you do really hate it.
[2910.94 → 2913.60] The guideline I've posted is actually not even that bad.
[2913.74 → 2915.28] Just get a flathead screwdriver and take it off.
[2915.64 → 2917.84] Like you can get rid of that glue residue pretty easily.
[2918.14 → 2919.66] And you can put like a cool deco there or something.
[2919.82 → 2920.88] Yeah put a cool deco.
[2920.98 → 2921.88] Fill it up with Plastic Dip.
[2922.16 → 2922.76] Do something.
[2923.02 → 2924.46] Like it's not that hard to fix.
[2924.98 → 2925.18] Yeah.
[2925.40 → 2927.02] So I'm actually amazed.
[2927.12 → 2928.78] They got over 7,000 signatures.
[2928.78 → 2930.24] I'm going to keep the old logo petition.
[2932.74 → 2933.72] Oh man.
[2933.86 → 2934.16] Yeah.
[2935.14 → 2937.92] So we want to do like interesting topic or like.
[2938.12 → 2938.48] Yeah.
[2938.68 → 2939.92] Let's go with interesting topic.
[2939.92 → 2940.36] Okay cool.
[2940.66 → 2941.02] All right.
[2941.14 → 2944.30] So we just got 14 nanometers.
[2944.78 → 2947.78] So Intel is just now releasing products.
[2947.86 → 2948.22] What is it?
[2948.28 → 2949.02] Core M?
[2949.78 → 2950.46] Or whatever it is.
[2950.60 → 2950.90] Yeah.
[2951.04 → 2951.98] The mobile one?
[2952.02 → 2952.12] Yeah.
[2952.18 → 2952.66] Bradwell Y.
[2952.80 → 2952.96] Yeah.
[2953.14 → 2953.36] Yeah.
[2953.36 → 2956.32] So these like super, super low power.
[2956.32 → 2964.40] We're talking Core i5 dual-core class processors with beefy dedicated graphics in like fanless
[2964.40 → 2964.92] tablets.
[2965.72 → 2966.76] Like pretty cool stuff.
[2966.84 → 2967.82] We just got those.
[2968.28 → 2973.04] And now in the news Intel's planning to spend another 6 billion.
[2973.26 → 2976.32] This time on a 10 nanometre fab.
[2976.32 → 2980.94] Every single time they go down in manufacturing process everyone's like oh this is it.
[2981.04 → 2982.00] They can't go any further.
[2982.52 → 2984.12] There's no way technology can advance.
[2984.24 → 2985.50] We've hit the end boys.
[2985.76 → 2987.70] This is as far as we can go.
[2987.90 → 2988.60] And then a couple of months later.
[2988.62 → 2989.14] War's law is dead.
[2989.20 → 2989.42] Yeah.
[2989.56 → 2989.70] Yeah.
[2989.88 → 2990.54] A couple of months later.
[2990.68 → 2991.78] New manufacturing plant.
[2991.94 → 2994.42] Billions of dollars have been spent, and they're going to make smaller ones.
[2994.52 → 2995.22] It's like okay.
[2995.52 → 2995.74] Cool.
[2995.92 → 2999.32] So this was posted by Jericho on the forum.
[2999.32 → 3006.16] You know it's funny along the lines of what you were just saying I remember my SSD Folsom
[3006.16 → 3007.00] campus tour.
[3007.32 → 3007.40] Yeah.
[3007.56 → 3009.44] When I got to visit Intel that one time.
[3010.38 → 3015.42] And I remember walking into a room where they basically said don't take any pictures
[3015.42 → 3016.36] or film anything in here.
[3016.42 → 3017.02] And I kind of went why?
[3017.74 → 3024.66] And it turned out that the whiteboard and like the drawings on it were, and I think it's
[3024.66 → 3025.42] late enough now.
[3025.52 → 3025.62] Yeah.
[3025.76 → 3027.22] 3D NAND is here.
[3027.34 → 3028.52] 3D transistors are here.
[3028.52 → 3031.48] But that was like the plan for 3D.
[3032.32 → 3032.52] You know.
[3032.62 → 3033.62] And I was like really?
[3034.58 → 3035.34] That's cool.
[3035.64 → 3037.76] It's like internal like drawings on a whiteboard.
[3037.84 → 3038.92] I was like that is so cool.
[3039.06 → 3039.18] Yeah.
[3039.34 → 3040.66] I'm geeking out right now.
[3040.82 → 3042.10] I don't understand any of it.
[3042.56 → 3043.86] But it's still awesome.
[3044.00 → 3045.42] But it's still frigging cool.
[3045.60 → 3045.74] Yeah.
[3045.88 → 3048.76] And I remember asking them questions in my interviews.
[3049.52 → 3051.48] You know we keep hearing about the end of Moore's law.
[3051.86 → 3055.86] We keep hearing about how Flash isn't going to continue to get higher density or whatever
[3055.86 → 3056.28] else.
[3056.28 → 3064.06] And I think if you look at sort of short term past sort of if you take a short term past
[3064.06 → 3065.66] chunk it might look that way.
[3065.66 → 3068.88] I mean the iPhone 6.
[3069.08 → 3070.10] If you look at devices.
[3070.30 → 3070.70] If you look at.
[3070.82 → 3072.40] Still comes in 16 gigs.
[3072.48 → 3076.90] If you look at solid state storage on its own though it is getting massively larger.
[3077.34 → 3077.92] It is.
[3077.92 → 3081.80] But looking at phones and devices and stuff like that.
[3082.04 → 3082.16] No.
[3082.52 → 3085.84] But to go back to the kind of growth we were seeing before.
[3086.24 → 3086.42] Yeah.
[3086.52 → 3087.84] I think we're going to have to wait a little bit.
[3088.14 → 3089.62] Because that's about to happen again.
[3090.12 → 3093.88] We look at what they're capable of doing with DDR4 for example.
[3094.06 → 3096.48] With some of the new die stacking technologies.
[3096.48 → 3100.66] You look at what Samsung is doing with their new 3D NAND.
[3100.82 → 3106.04] Where they're taking instead of having you know 20 nanometre class NAND that's spread
[3106.04 → 3107.22] out horizontally.
[3107.54 → 3113.42] They're stacking 40 nanometre class NAND to get the same capacities and better reliability
[3113.42 → 3116.58] and better speeds with about the same raw material.
[3116.58 → 3118.20] So they take that technology.
[3118.34 → 3119.16] They shrink that down.
[3119.34 → 3119.66] Whoa.
[3119.96 → 3122.08] Capacities are not done yet.
[3122.14 → 3127.28] Every time that we feel like we hit some sort of wall someone goes oh hey if we climb
[3127.28 → 3129.38] it in this really weird way we can keep going.
[3129.54 → 3131.14] That happens like every single time.
[3131.34 → 3132.20] It'll make no sense.
[3132.36 → 3133.64] Then someone will come up with an alternative.
[3133.92 → 3135.80] It will make tons of sense, and we will keep on going.
[3135.94 → 3137.66] And it's Intel almost every time.
[3138.10 → 3142.92] It's funny because I got called out on our fastest possible about process technologies
[3142.92 → 3149.14] manufacturing processes for like favouring Intel or like fanboying over Intel because
[3149.14 → 3156.66] I brought up basically I alluded to their TikTok development process and I also
[3156.66 → 3158.48] I don't know what's going on with my computer.
[3158.48 → 3158.76] Okay.
[3158.96 → 3165.34] And I also brought up the Core M as my example of 14 nanometre processor, but I went back and
[3165.34 → 3166.08] looked into it.
[3166.40 → 3171.36] Intel has been first to every process node over like the last 20 years.
[3171.36 → 3174.10] And they hit a new one like every two years.
[3174.40 → 3177.14] That's not a real point of debate.
[3177.40 → 3177.54] Yeah.
[3177.62 → 3178.84] It's just a thing.
[3179.14 → 3182.46] You can debate different like processors at different price skews and all that kind of
[3182.46 → 3182.74] stuff.
[3182.76 → 3183.22] Different architectures.
[3183.24 → 3184.04] Different architectures.
[3184.32 → 3185.06] Optimize for gaming.
[3185.34 → 3185.50] Yeah.
[3185.50 → 3186.30] Optimize for tablet.
[3186.44 → 3186.58] Yeah.
[3186.64 → 3188.30] You can definitely debate all that kind of stuff.
[3189.30 → 3189.74] Manufacturing.
[3189.84 → 3193.20] They developed this thing at this date and then that's what happened.
[3193.56 → 3194.46] There's I don't know.
[3194.64 → 3195.96] There are facts.
[3196.78 → 3198.70] Posted by Red Round 2 on the forum.
[3198.84 → 3200.46] The original article from Nantes.
[3200.46 → 3204.00] We actually alluded to this just a moment ago.
[3204.20 → 3209.84] But the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are benchmark monsters.
[3210.44 → 3211.76] So there you go.
[3211.88 → 3218.98] There's the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, the 5S, Shield tablet, Windows phone.
[3219.48 → 3222.42] Are we going to find an Android device that doesn't have a Terra K1 in it?
[3222.48 → 3222.94] Here we go.
[3223.84 → 3224.50] Oh boy.
[3224.50 → 3224.56] Okay.
[3224.86 → 3230.88] So they are wrecking machines, and they don't do that well in every single benchmark, but
[3230.88 → 3235.30] they are at or near the top of the charts pretty much across the board.
[3235.68 → 3235.98] So...
[3235.98 → 3236.00] Yay.
[3236.08 → 3238.58] The newest phone does the best things.
[3239.08 → 3239.42] Yeah.
[3239.52 → 3243.72] I was going to say, as exciting as this might be and as great as it is that we're getting
[3243.72 → 3245.28] faster and faster mobile devices.
[3245.28 → 3252.80] I think that the people who are disappointed in the iPhone 6 are the same people who were
[3252.80 → 3258.76] disappointed in the Galaxy 5S, but just that happened to carry something with an Apple logo
[3258.76 → 3261.66] in their pocket versus something with a Samsung logo in their pocket.
[3261.66 → 3266.76] I think we're all getting disenchanted with smartphones all at the same time.
[3267.08 → 3267.78] I am.
[3269.28 → 3269.94] Like hardcore.
[3270.50 → 3271.46] That's a thing.
[3271.68 → 3272.62] I think...
[3272.62 → 3277.78] We've talked about how phones are going through the same thing PCs did, but they're going through
[3277.78 → 3283.14] the same thing PCs did over an extremely long period of time, and they're surpassing where
[3283.14 → 3287.14] PCs are at, but then not getting that thing where PCs kind of dwindled for a little while
[3287.14 → 3288.16] and now we're awesome again.
[3288.16 → 3291.94] I don't think they're really getting that, and I don't know if they are going to.
[3292.18 → 3292.32] No.
[3292.42 → 3292.56] No.
[3292.60 → 3297.44] The future for phones is definitely going to be in interface design and not in hardware,
[3297.76 → 3299.62] at least over the next little while.
[3299.62 → 3303.30] Software usability, HCI, which is called human-computer interaction.
[3303.48 → 3307.98] So just like how you use your phone, like natural paper thing that Android's trying to
[3307.98 → 3309.86] do, all that kind of stuff is going to be a huge deal.
[3310.26 → 3310.48] Yep.
[3310.74 → 3311.10] Fluidity.
[3311.50 → 3312.30] And wearable devices.
[3312.52 → 3314.32] I'm really disappointed in the Moto 360.
[3314.48 → 3314.84] So am I.
[3314.88 → 3316.00] Now that the reviews are out.
[3316.00 → 3321.56] I actually walked into a Best Buy the morning of the launch, kind of not really thinking
[3321.56 → 3321.90] about it.
[3321.96 → 3326.06] I'd been napping in the car that was driving me from the airport to the NVIDIA event and
[3326.06 → 3327.90] I walked in, and I was like, holy crap, it's a Moto 360.
[3329.74 → 3330.10] Interesting.
[3330.10 → 3331.00] Do you have any?
[3331.10 → 3332.40] And the guy at the till said yes.
[3332.90 → 3336.76] So I just about bought one right there just so I could review it if nothing else.
[3336.76 → 3342.72] And now I'm kind of glad I didn't because the thing that I was expecting it to disappoint
[3342.72 → 3345.98] me with is exactly what it's disappointing everybody with.
[3346.32 → 3346.88] Battery life.
[3346.94 → 3347.10] Yeah.
[3347.60 → 3348.82] But it didn't need to.
[3349.56 → 3350.26] It just did.
[3351.20 → 3352.72] What was the size of the processor?
[3352.86 → 3353.50] 40 nanometre?
[3353.66 → 3353.84] Yeah.
[3353.98 → 3354.66] It's from 2010.
[3354.66 → 3354.86] It's from 2010.
[3354.86 → 3354.88] It's from 2010.
[3354.88 → 3354.96] It's from 2010.
[3355.04 → 3355.92] Like ancient chip.
[3355.92 → 3356.48] What are you doing?
[3357.38 → 3363.00] I mean, the issue though, and there could be a hundred reasons why they would have gone
[3363.00 → 3363.86] with that processor.
[3364.32 → 3365.68] There's also a hundred reasons not to.
[3365.70 → 3370.04] There's a hundred reasons not to, but there's a hundred reasons why they might have had to.
[3370.18 → 3370.34] Yeah.
[3370.90 → 3379.30] But the cold hard truth is until we get dramatically better batteries, the only smartwatches that
[3379.30 → 3383.28] will matter to me will be the ones with e-ink or Girasol displays.
[3383.48 → 3385.76] I don't want to charge my smartwatch every single day.
[3386.12 → 3386.30] Yep.
[3386.46 → 3389.12] I charge this every four days or so.
[3389.12 → 3389.90] That's probably fine.
[3389.96 → 3390.94] I would like seven.
[3391.34 → 3392.36] I would like it to be a week.
[3392.48 → 3393.94] Some people get a week out of the pebble.
[3394.30 → 3395.56] I don't because I'm a heavy user.
[3395.56 → 3395.74] Yeah.
[3395.96 → 3396.04] Yeah.
[3396.46 → 3401.48] But the main thing for me is when you're at that awkward dinner, and you just want to
[3401.48 → 3406.16] know how much longer you have to sit there across from that weird family member who you
[3406.16 → 3410.48] only have to see once a quarter or so, and you want to glance at your wrist, just freaking
[3410.48 → 3411.52] know what time it is.
[3412.00 → 3413.22] That's important to me.
[3413.22 → 3417.46] It's not a time piece unless it does time well first.
[3418.46 → 3419.12] That's true.
[3419.34 → 3420.02] That's very true.
[3420.26 → 3424.50] Luke pointed out to me a smartwatch that's coming that has a transparent display over
[3424.50 → 3425.46] an analog watch face.
[3425.46 → 3429.60] And this is something if you go back a bunch of WAN shows, like quite a few, that
[3429.60 → 3434.36] was like they need to make an OLED panel that goes on top of a normal freaking watch and
[3434.36 → 3437.70] can just turn on and give you notifications every once in a while so it can completely
[3437.70 → 3441.38] go off, and you can just see the normal watch face under it because that's what a lot of
[3441.38 → 3445.48] people are going to watch, going to want because that is going to look super, super classy.
[3445.48 → 3449.72] And a lot of people want their high-end looking, very nice mechanical watches.
[3449.72 → 3451.72] And apparently it has happened.
[3451.72 → 3455.96] Speaking of wanting watches to look super, super classy.
[3455.96 → 3457.96] Kind of, kind of funny story.
[3457.96 → 3463.50] There are a lot of people who seem upset that Apple Watch or whatever they end up calling
[3463.50 → 3464.50] it.
[3464.50 → 3465.50] Apple Watch, I guess.
[3465.50 → 3468.96] So that Apple's watch is going to be expensive.
[3468.96 → 3469.96] It's like, yeah.
[3469.96 → 3470.96] How did you not see that coming?
[3470.96 → 3471.96] How did you not see that coming?
[3471.96 → 3472.96] How did you not see that coming?
[3472.96 → 3483.96] Watches that literally have no justification for being expensive are expensive.
[3483.96 → 3485.46] Watches are a fashion statement.
[3485.46 → 3486.46] Fashion statements are expensive.
[3486.46 → 3487.46] Yep.
[3487.46 → 3492.50] Watches and Apple turned the phone into a fashion statement in a big way.
[3492.50 → 3495.06] I mean, they weren't, they weren't the pioneer of it.
[3495.06 → 3498.94] I mean, Motorola did a great job with the razor, but Apple turned the smartphone into a
[3498.94 → 3502.88] smartphone into the ultimate phone fashion statement.
[3502.88 → 3505.72] But watches, they don't even have to do any work.
[3505.72 → 3511.40] People will already spend a thousand, like normal people who work normal jobs will spend
[3511.40 → 3514.70] a thousand, two thousand, three thousand dollars on a watch.
[3514.70 → 3515.70] That happens.
[3515.70 → 3522.20] I know that technophiles who expect everything that they own to be broken down in terms of
[3522.20 → 3525.60] the bomb cost, like the cost of the raw materials that went into it.
[3525.60 → 3528.38] I know that we don't necessarily accept that.
[3528.38 → 3533.32] And if you look at me, it's not like I'm, I'm someone who wears a thousand dollar watch.
[3533.32 → 3535.16] I expect things to be practical.
[3535.16 → 3538.94] I expect them to have an actual value and an actual cost associated with making them.
[3538.94 → 3539.94] I do too.
[3539.94 → 3541.44] But a lot of the world doesn't work that way.
[3541.44 → 3542.44] No.
[3542.44 → 3545.06] And Apple would be foolish not to leverage that.
[3545.06 → 3548.88] And that's why I've been saying we need those mechanical OLED panel watches because those
[3548.88 → 3550.94] are going to be crazy expensive.
[3550.94 → 3552.68] And that's what a lot of people are going to want to buy.
[3552.68 → 3553.94] I don't want one.
[3553.94 → 3554.94] Way too expensive.
[3554.94 → 3555.94] Yeah.
[3555.94 → 3556.94] But that's what a lot of people are going to want.
[3556.94 → 3560.00] I'd like to do a review of one, even if we can just get a loaner one for a little while.
[3560.00 → 3561.00] But yeah.
[3561.00 → 3568.62] Speaking of a review, I had a few people questioning my Instagram post earlier today where I showed
[3568.62 → 3571.82] off my new $300 USB 3 cable.
[3573.82 → 3575.20] I bought that thing.
[3576.30 → 3576.90] What?
[3577.74 → 3579.74] Well, I guess it'll be a review.
[3579.74 → 3580.74] It'll be a review.
[3580.74 → 3581.74] It'll be a review.
[3581.74 → 3583.88] But there's a justification for it.
[3583.88 → 3588.06] It's the coolest USB 3 cable that has ever existed.
[3588.06 → 3592.04] The highest tech USB 3 cable that has ever existed.
[3592.04 → 3594.60] And it is a fibre optic USB 3 cable.
[3594.60 → 3595.60] Oh yeah, that one.
[3595.60 → 3599.98] In fact, it doesn't even adhere to the USB 3.0 standard.
[3599.98 → 3600.98] Nope.
[3600.98 → 3604.90] There is no standard for a fibre optic USB 3 cable.
[3604.90 → 3606.78] So the packaging is hilarious.
[3606.78 → 3608.98] It says USB 3.0 optical.
[3608.98 → 3613.36] So it's a 30 meter.
[3613.36 → 3614.86] So it's literally 3.0.
[3614.86 → 3615.86] Get it?
[3615.86 → 3616.86] Yeah.
[3616.86 → 3617.86] Get it?
[3617.86 → 3618.86] Get it?
[3618.86 → 3621.94] So this is a 100 foot USB 3 cable.
[3621.94 → 3626.74] And I actually have a plan for something really cool that I'm going to do with it that I'll
[3626.74 → 3628.26] show off to you guys.
[3628.26 → 3635.20] And that I think will make some sense at least to people who appreciate minimalistic design.
[3635.20 → 3636.42] So stay tuned for that.
[3636.42 → 3637.42] There is a reason for it.
[3637.42 → 3640.30] I haven't just completely lost my noggin.
[3640.30 → 3641.30] All right.
[3641.30 → 3643.30] Uh, AMD India.
[3643.30 → 3646.30] Do you want to go through this one while I figure out what's going on with my internet
[3646.30 → 3647.30] connection here?
[3647.30 → 3648.30] Sure.
[3648.30 → 3651.30] So that big announcement that everyone was talking about that was going to happen on September
[3651.30 → 3652.30] 25th.
[3652.30 → 3653.30] From AMD.
[3653.30 → 3657.30] I'm like, oh my god, it's probably going to be a 390 or 390X.
[3657.30 → 3657.62] Nope.
[3657.62 → 3658.62] Nope.
[3658.62 → 3659.12] Nope.
[3659.12 → 3659.18] Nope.
[3659.18 → 3659.62] Nope.
[3659.62 → 3661.54] They're bringing some graphics cards to India.
[3662.18 → 3664.60] Um, so I don't actually know what ones.
[3664.60 → 3666.38] It looks like mainly workstation cards.
[3666.38 → 3677.18] So they're bringing an AMD Fire Pro W8100 and AMD Fire Pro W9100 and GCN powered Radeon R9 285.
[3677.26 → 3679.86] So they're bringing a 285 and then two workstation cards.
[3679.86 → 3685.18] So yeah, that was that super exciting announcement that was going to happen on September 25th.
[3685.18 → 3687.30] The 9100 does have 16 gigs of RAM.
[3687.38 → 3688.26] That's pretty friggin' cool.
[3688.34 → 3690.64] Speaking of RAM capacities continuing to grow.
[3690.92 → 3691.24] Yeah.
[3691.24 → 3694.98] But it's weird when they're blasting a big announcement to North Americans and Europeans
[3694.98 → 3699.28] about, like if they blasted this in India, that makes tons of sense.
[3699.40 → 3699.70] Yeah.
[3699.84 → 3701.50] Because that is a big announcement in India.
[3701.66 → 3704.20] I think it was, it seems a little unintentional.
[3704.28 → 3706.96] To me, it looks a little bit like a miscommunication at AMD.
[3707.32 → 3710.64] So like someone posted a big announcement, maybe even in India, and then it got pushed
[3710.64 → 3710.94] everywhere?
[3711.10 → 3711.26] Yeah.
[3711.44 → 3714.36] Some, the press got a hold of the Indian announcement.
[3714.64 → 3718.02] I think some individuals at AMD didn't really know what to do or what to say about it.
[3718.10 → 3719.18] It felt like they had to say something.
[3719.18 → 3722.26] Something and ended up.
[3723.10 → 3726.18] They could have specifically said it's a big announcement for India.
[3726.70 → 3728.44] Because it's pretty cool for India.
[3729.20 → 3729.56] Right.
[3730.92 → 3735.50] But it's a very tied down announcement, which makes sense, but it's still a very tied down
[3735.50 → 3735.78] announcement.
[3735.90 → 3737.38] So they could have clarified.
[3738.16 → 3738.46] Right.
[3738.64 → 3739.94] I don't think that would have been a problem.
[3740.58 → 3742.32] Everyone started freaking out, and then they could have been like, oh.
[3742.32 → 3746.44] But you don't want to downplay it either and like make it seem like, yeah, our announcement's
[3746.44 → 3747.24] lame, so.
[3747.52 → 3748.40] But it's not lame.
[3748.54 → 3748.98] No, it isn't.
[3748.98 → 3750.08] It's just location tied.
[3750.20 → 3750.98] I mean, okay, okay.
[3751.02 → 3754.62] What they say about the 16 gig GPU is that it allows users, and I mean, this is pretty
[3754.62 → 3758.20] cool, to multitask efficiently across six 4K displays.
[3758.76 → 3759.40] That's pretty sick.
[3759.44 → 3760.26] Is that not cool?
[3760.44 → 3761.06] That is pretty sick.
[3761.10 → 3762.60] Six DisplayPort 1.2.
[3762.64 → 3764.78] I mean, the number of megapixels.
[3765.62 → 3767.46] The sheer data rates involved with this.
[3767.50 → 3768.24] It's very cool.
[3768.50 → 3768.72] Yeah.
[3768.72 → 3772.94] It's just gamers and sort of the internet in general aren't really going to care about
[3772.94 → 3773.08] it.
[3773.32 → 3773.54] Yeah.
[3773.66 → 3778.84] So I think they should have checked their announcement a little bit.
[3778.94 → 3780.08] It was a little bit overthrown.
[3781.08 → 3781.68] All right.
[3781.68 → 3785.40] DisplayPort will work through USB Type-C.
[3785.72 → 3787.80] That is incredibly good news.
[3787.90 → 3788.86] That's pretty freaking cool.
[3788.98 → 3790.06] I'm actually pretty excited about that.
[3790.16 → 3794.02] USB Type-C is looking like it's going to be badass.
[3794.02 → 3796.30] I'm just really hoping that connector is solid.
[3796.52 → 3797.32] I know.
[3798.12 → 3799.48] It's the only thing I'm worried about.
[3799.62 → 3802.48] I was talking to Ryan Smith from Nantes.
[3802.56 → 3807.38] We were in the shuttle on the way back to the airport together, and we were talking about
[3807.38 → 3810.16] USB Type-C, because they had an article about it.
[3810.30 → 3812.62] They were hands-on with it, and I was like, did you see it?
[3812.62 → 3813.08] Did you touch it?
[3813.12 → 3814.06] He's like, no.
[3814.38 → 3815.34] No, but I want to.
[3815.88 → 3816.14] What?
[3816.64 → 3818.44] Oh, so he specifically was like, okay, I got it.
[3818.44 → 3818.98] Yeah, yeah.
[3819.08 → 3821.18] No, someone else, one of their other writers.
[3821.18 → 3826.00] So, we were just kind of speculating and talking about it a little bit.
[3826.06 → 3830.36] We both agree that the Lightning connector is probably about as elegant as it gets for
[3830.36 → 3837.54] a double-sided connector in terms of durability, but we both maintain hope that USB 3 Type-C will
[3837.54 → 3838.90] be freaking awesome.
[3839.12 → 3839.42] Hopefully.
[3839.64 → 3843.64] So, just as a recap for you guys, if you haven't already watched our Fastest Possible
[3843.64 → 3850.30] on USB Type-C, which is now outdated because it includes DisplayPort connectivity, it is validated
[3850.30 → 3855.50] at up to super speed USB 3.1, so that's 10 gigabits per second, bringing it back within
[3855.50 → 3857.96] sort of one leap of Thunderbolt.
[3858.94 → 3863.54] It can deliver up to 100 watts of power over a single cable, so we're talking being able
[3863.54 → 3866.38] to charge your laptop over USB.
[3867.06 → 3869.92] You can charge your laptop, run a display off your laptop at the same time, because it
[3869.92 → 3870.72] can go either direction.
[3871.00 → 3871.68] Pretty awesome.
[3871.68 → 3872.76] Yep, bidirectional.
[3873.10 → 3880.44] It has alternate modes that support the use of existing HDMI, DVI, and VGA adapters now
[3880.44 → 3883.02] that DisplayPort can be transmitted over it.
[3883.54 → 3887.54] The DisplayPort over USB-C carries up to 8.1 gigabit per second per lane.
[3888.88 → 3890.20] This looks so awesome.
[3890.20 → 3895.18] So, when using all four lanes of the DisplayPort alt mode, you could drive a monitor at up to
[3895.18 → 3896.40] 5K resolution.
[3897.22 → 3897.90] That's pretty nice.
[3897.90 → 3902.56] And up to 4K, excuse me, so with existing DisplayPort 1, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[3902.68 → 3907.48] etc, support up to 4K desktop resolutions with 60 frame rates at up to 30-bit colour.
[3907.66 → 3907.80] Yeah.
[3908.06 → 3911.48] So, 4K USB 3 Type-C is a thing.
[3912.02 → 3913.02] Freaking awesome.
[3913.04 → 3913.78] That's pretty sweet.
[3914.94 → 3915.76] Pretty stoked.
[3915.76 → 3924.30] We are almost out of time, and we need to do the giveaway, and we need to do sponsor spots,
[3924.48 → 3928.02] and we need to do build blogs, and we probably need to do some other articles.
[3928.16 → 3930.00] Okay, well, let's do our sponsors first.
[3930.12 → 3934.02] Huge thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring the WAN show.
[3934.66 → 3937.82] Yeah, they're taking a little while because they're looking for network resources, and
[3937.82 → 3938.76] then grabbing the local one.
[3938.92 → 3940.84] That's why the scene switching is taking a while.
[3941.02 → 3942.04] That makes way more sense.
[3942.04 → 3946.84] But if you had a Squarespace website, it wouldn't need to take a long time to load because Squarespace
[3946.84 → 3949.36] ensures that your website will be functional.
[3949.64 → 3951.02] It will be beautiful.
[3951.20 → 3953.44] It will be affordable, and it will be scalable.
[3953.72 → 3960.26] We use Squarespace for linusmediagroup.com, and I don't think we've ever maintained it ever.
[3961.24 → 3961.68] No.
[3962.02 → 3963.10] That's actually kind of a problem.
[3963.62 → 3966.32] Yeah, we need to go back and update some of the stuff.
[3966.32 → 3969.98] It still looks beautiful, and it's still entirely functional, but it doesn't have all of our
[3969.98 → 3970.34] employees.
[3970.52 → 3971.44] There are no headshots.
[3971.64 → 3973.62] It doesn't include all of our shows, I don't think.
[3973.76 → 3975.26] There's a lot of missing information.
[3976.02 → 3977.66] Because I never even think about it.
[3977.70 → 3978.46] It just works.
[3978.66 → 3984.78] All the screenshots from our most best videos ever are the ones we made in the first couple
[3984.78 → 3985.80] months of being a company.
[3986.20 → 3986.82] I know.
[3987.06 → 3989.08] So, guys, that's what Squarespace does.
[3989.08 → 3995.16] It means that you can focus on maintaining your business in other ways that don't involve
[3995.16 → 3997.90] micromanaging your freaking website.
[3997.90 → 4002.64] Whether it's a blog, whether you have an online business where you sell something that, some
[4002.64 → 4004.30] craft that you make, or a service.
[4004.70 → 4009.20] Whether it's a portfolio, promoting, you know, if you're a wedding photographer or whatever
[4009.20 → 4009.64] else.
[4009.98 → 4011.74] Squarespace sites work on desktop.
[4011.96 → 4012.78] They work on mobile.
[4012.78 → 4015.44] And they make sure that you put your best foot forward.
[4015.56 → 4020.76] They've also got other great tools, like their 24-7 tech support, as well as their logo creator.
[4021.16 → 4025.86] So instead of, you know, hiring a graphic design firm just to try to get started, you
[4025.86 → 4029.76] can at least create something that looks good that you can use temporarily and get on your
[4029.76 → 4032.42] site and get up and running without hassle.
[4032.82 → 4037.86] Also, if you visit squarespace.com slash Linus and use offer code Linus, you can save 10%.
[4037.86 → 4044.00] And, of course, everyone who uses Squarespace gets a free trial, a free two-week trial.
[4044.44 → 4051.48] I actually don't remember what Nick said about whether we are giving away a Squarespace.
[4052.24 → 4053.26] I don't have internet.
[4053.88 → 4054.06] Okay.
[4055.00 → 4055.76] No, it's okay.
[4055.86 → 4059.38] Well, if we don't, then we'll do two next time we have a Squarespace sponsorship.
[4059.70 → 4065.86] But every month, we give a Squarespace site away to someone who has signed up for a trial.
[4066.00 → 4067.50] So they win their site for a year.
[4067.86 → 4071.20] So that's Squarespace's little way of being cool dudes.
[4071.28 → 4072.20] This is pretty awesome, actually.
[4072.52 → 4073.30] Thanks to Squarespace.
[4073.48 → 4078.34] They've actually been, I think, our second-longest sponsor after Audible.
[4078.98 → 4079.30] Yeah.
[4079.44 → 4080.88] They've been great supporters of it.
[4080.88 → 4083.98] If you don't include how long we left Razor at the bottom of the stream for.
[4084.66 → 4084.96] Yeah.
[4085.20 → 4087.42] No, no, I don't mean long in terms of time period.
[4087.52 → 4088.88] I mean going back the furthest.
[4088.88 → 4089.40] Oh, yeah.
[4089.64 → 4091.66] They were one of our first non-tech sponsors.
[4091.88 → 4092.44] Yeah, yeah.
[4092.98 → 4097.78] Also, lynda.com, a relatively new sponsor, but actually a fantastic one as well.
[4097.86 → 4101.96] You can get a free trial by going to lynda.com slash WAN show right now.
[4102.28 → 4103.36] And you've used lynda.com.
[4103.52 → 4103.80] Yes.
[4104.02 → 4107.50] I have used lynda.com for quite a while to learn just random stuff.
[4108.24 → 4110.02] More specifically targeted things.
[4110.10 → 4113.58] If I'm like, I need to know this thing about programming so I can do something with it.
[4113.64 → 4115.04] I usually go to lynda.com for that.
[4115.36 → 4117.10] My mom has used it for various things.
[4117.24 → 4120.78] Taryn, one of our editors, has used it to learn how to edit, which is probably a good
[4120.78 → 4122.44] thing if he has to edit.
[4122.76 → 4124.90] I wonder if he's using it right now while he's not working.
[4124.90 → 4127.46] I don't know.
[4127.54 → 4128.26] I would think so.
[4128.46 → 4128.68] Probably.
[4128.90 → 4129.56] I mean, his wrist is hurt.
[4129.66 → 4130.76] That doesn't mean your eyes are broken.
[4130.92 → 4131.04] Yeah.
[4131.04 → 4132.54] So you can still learn things on lynda.com.
[4132.56 → 4135.12] Because not everything on lynda.com is just programming stuff.
[4135.30 → 4137.64] They have tips for digital photography.
[4138.84 → 4140.86] And they're all taught by experts.
[4141.02 → 4143.62] So there are tons of different things that you can learn on lynda.com.
[4144.64 → 4146.38] Plans start at $25 a month.
[4146.64 → 4148.48] I don't think there's that much more to say about it.
[4148.48 → 4151.12] Other than that, there's no real commitment, guys.
[4151.22 → 4153.10] You can try it for seven days for free.
[4153.26 → 4157.30] If you like it, if you feel like you're learning something useful, then keep on going.
[4157.38 → 4159.10] And if you don't like it, then you don't have to.
[4159.24 → 4164.76] But we've seen here at Linus Media Group alone that for at least two people, lynda.com
[4164.76 → 4170.26] has provided some foundation for some skills that have turned into real employment opportunities,
[4170.26 → 4176.02] which is, I think, one of the strongest things that we can say about any sponsor that we have.
[4176.02 → 4179.64] One thing that I always say about it is if you're planning on going to post-secondary for programming,
[4180.02 → 4182.98] start working on lynda.com right now and teach yourself before you go.
[4183.14 → 4184.58] Because your grades will be much higher.
[4184.86 → 4185.92] You'll find it a lot easier.
[4186.08 → 4190.08] I find a lot of people the first semester they go to university for is kind of a mess
[4190.08 → 4192.68] because they're getting used to no longer possibly being at home,
[4193.12 → 4195.32] how school works in different ways now,
[4195.38 → 4198.54] and possibly certain electives that are pretty difficult or weird that you haven't done before.
[4198.62 → 4201.86] So if you can make your core courses easier,
[4201.98 → 4204.18] which will be your programming courses if you're getting into programming,
[4204.74 → 4205.94] that's invaluable.
[4206.50 → 4210.20] All right, so thanks, lynda.com and Squarespace, for sponsoring the WAN show.
[4210.40 → 4211.82] We appreciate your sponsorship.
[4212.04 → 4214.02] I think our viewers appreciate your service.
[4214.38 → 4216.66] And let's move on to our next topic then, shall we?
[4216.98 → 4221.90] Blizzard cancels its next-gen MMO Titan after seven years of development.
[4222.34 → 4226.16] Can you imagine having enough money as a company that you can work on something for seven years
[4226.16 → 4228.40] and then just go, eh, it's not turning out the way we liked it?
[4228.44 → 4230.70] Well, Valve trashed TF2.
[4231.26 → 4234.58] TF2 was like almost done, and they're like, eh, no.
[4234.58 → 4234.90] Yep.
[4235.00 → 4238.22] And tossed the whole thing away, and then now they have what we have now,
[4238.30 → 4239.74] which everyone kind of seems to love.
[4239.88 → 4241.34] So they probably did the right thing.
[4241.62 → 4243.24] And hopefully that's the same story with Blizzard.
[4243.70 → 4247.48] Hopefully they just decided maybe this isn't the right direction after all,
[4247.60 → 4248.70] and kind of pitched it.
[4248.80 → 4251.52] Or maybe they're just refocusing on WoW.
[4251.64 → 4252.92] That wouldn't even be too surprising.
[4253.92 → 4257.96] World of Warcraft is getting a massive graphical update with Warlords of Praetor,
[4257.96 → 4260.30] and a bunch of other stuff is happening.
[4260.64 → 4261.30] So it could be just a refocus.
[4261.30 → 4262.18] Should I try it again?
[4262.36 → 4263.62] I haven't played since Vanilla.
[4265.94 → 4266.76] You could.
[4267.18 → 4271.82] We're probably going to have to, actually, yeah, seeing as how you did that, maybe not.
[4272.44 → 4275.08] We're probably going to have to benchmark it when it comes out.
[4275.16 → 4275.68] Right, yeah.
[4275.68 → 4279.48] Because it'll be the biggest change in performance that that game has ever had since release.
[4280.50 → 4281.10] That big?
[4281.46 → 4283.92] Because they've done some significant updates before.
[4283.92 → 4285.64] But I don't think they've had one nearly this big.
[4285.78 → 4286.14] Interesting.
[4286.22 → 4287.26] It's a pretty big graphical update.
[4287.34 → 4289.04] They have definitely had graphical updates.
[4289.22 → 4289.32] Yeah.
[4289.38 → 4292.32] And one thing that they've done is they've just included more stuff.
[4292.58 → 4292.80] Right.
[4293.12 → 4296.64] So there are more things to load in general, especially with the new zones that came in with stuff like capitalism.
[4296.64 → 4298.70] Especially if you have longer draw distances.
[4298.98 → 4299.60] Longer draw distances.
[4300.08 → 4304.64] So they've done a lot with it, but I think this is the most in terms of actual texture files.
[4304.64 → 4307.30] Because the characters are being upgraded a lot.
[4307.70 → 4308.82] Someone could correct me on that.
[4308.88 → 4312.04] I could be wrong, but I believe it is the biggest one they've had so far.
[4312.04 → 4318.34] So they're talking about it actually pretty openly for Blizzard, which is surprising.
[4318.80 → 4323.04] But they went back to the drawing board last year, and now they're basically just saying,
[4323.14 → 4326.70] well, we made WoW, and we figured we knew how to make an MMO, but here we are.
[4326.78 → 4328.58] We're looking at this, and we're not finding the fun.
[4329.22 → 4331.16] And if it's not fun, then what's the bloody point?
[4331.22 → 4335.36] Basically, it's not the first time they've cancelled a significant project that had a lot of hype around it.
[4335.36 → 4335.44] Ghost.
[4335.44 → 4335.66] Yeah.
[4335.90 → 4339.70] Star Craft Ghost was supposed to be an FPS about ghosts.
[4339.70 → 4341.64] I was pretty stoked for that, actually.
[4341.72 → 4342.20] Oh, different ghost.
[4342.36 → 4345.48] That was one of the most games that I was most hyped about ever.
[4345.80 → 4348.06] I mean, they just ripped it from reality.
[4348.72 → 4349.22] That was unfortunate.
[4349.24 → 4353.00] I mean, they had all that artwork of Kerrigan and like, that's going to be cool.
[4353.26 → 4353.50] Nova.
[4353.86 → 4354.54] So much for that.
[4354.98 → 4355.42] All right.
[4355.46 → 4359.14] So we'll do a few rapid fire topics before we get into...
[4359.14 → 4360.34] We have build logs and the giveaway.
[4360.44 → 4360.96] Yeah, I know.
[4360.96 → 4365.44] The 12-inch MacBook Air is rumoured to maybe have a USB Type-C port.
[4365.82 → 4366.60] That would be very cool.
[4367.04 → 4367.78] Very unexpected.
[4367.96 → 4371.16] I would expect Apple to continue to support Thunderbolt exclusively.
[4371.54 → 4375.48] Mind you, with how many of the rumours about the iPhone 6 were just completely out in la-la land,
[4375.92 → 4377.70] I'd be surprised if this one's true.
[4378.00 → 4378.06] Yeah.
[4378.22 → 4381.88] Sleeping Dogs sequel Triad Wars is going to be PC exclusive.
[4381.88 → 4384.22] Hopefully not as many bugs as there was in the console port.
[4385.04 → 4388.10] LED SLI bridges have now been released.
[4388.10 → 4392.22] So the ones used in the Mod24 rigs, that modding competition that we checked out,
[4392.46 → 4398.28] and that have been seen before in like NVIDIA showcase builds for quite some time.
[4398.52 → 4398.54] Yeah.
[4399.18 → 4401.34] Here, we've got a shot of them here.
[4401.60 → 4406.16] So those sexy metal SLI bridges that match the cards really well.
[4406.26 → 4409.36] And they're also releasing two different spacings for a dual card.
[4409.64 → 4410.84] Yes, I saw that.
[4411.36 → 4414.54] So they're releasing like side-by-sides, especially if you have something like an MATE port,
[4414.60 → 4415.52] you might want to have that.
[4415.52 → 4419.38] And they're releasing the like empty space between the cards on it.
[4419.64 → 4420.04] I love it.
[4420.10 → 4425.32] They're only $30 for a two-way and $40 for a three-way model, which isn't that cheap.
[4425.68 → 4429.42] But when you consider how much you've just already spent on your graphics cards,
[4429.48 → 4430.82] I don't think it's that much of an adder.
[4431.08 → 4431.22] Yeah.
[4431.94 → 4432.38] Yeah.
[4432.66 → 4433.06] Fantastic.
[4433.64 → 4433.88] Yep.
[4435.88 → 4438.76] Nintendo's quasi-quincentennial...
[4438.76 → 4439.54] What the heck?
[4439.66 → 4440.06] Oh, okay.
[4440.12 → 4440.32] Whatever.
[4440.32 → 4442.80] So they turned 125 on Tuesday.
[4443.90 → 4448.00] For most of Nintendo's life, they produced cards, toys, and other random stuff,
[4448.12 → 4452.34] and didn't transition to video games until actually the 1970s.
[4452.82 → 4454.10] So pretty cool.
[4454.24 → 4454.98] Way to go, Nintendo.
[4455.24 → 4455.70] Happy birthday.
[4455.84 → 4457.44] And they've been doing a lot of great stuff lately, actually.
[4457.52 → 4459.54] They've totally turned around in the last little while.
[4459.90 → 4463.20] Even looking at stuff like their DLC for Mario Kart that they're coming out with,
[4463.36 → 4464.56] absolutely fantastic.
[4464.56 → 4467.08] They're going to double the amount of tracks that there is.
[4467.22 → 4467.48] Or no.
[4468.44 → 4471.56] They're 150% the current amount.
[4471.80 → 4473.38] So they're adding 50% the amount of tracks.
[4473.66 → 4473.78] Nice.
[4473.78 → 4475.54] A bunch more racers, a bunch of new cars,
[4475.76 → 4478.72] and they're continuing down that line with DLC, and they're coming out with Smash.
[4478.84 → 4481.60] You know what I like about what they did with Mario Kart?
[4481.72 → 4484.82] Because there's the usual argument where, oh, well, it's DLC,
[4485.08 → 4487.80] so you shouldn't have made us pay for it in the first place.
[4487.84 → 4488.72] It should have been in the game.
[4488.72 → 4494.32] They included exactly as many tracks as they normally do in a Mario Kart game.
[4494.42 → 4495.92] So that complaint can just...
[4495.92 → 4498.42] And that's a philosophy that's carrying into other games as well,
[4498.48 → 4500.54] and they've publicly said that they're not going to change that.
[4500.64 → 4502.80] Their golf game, I've never played any of their golf games,
[4502.88 → 4506.54] but apparently they have a minimum for the amount of courses and holes
[4506.54 → 4507.60] that will be in a golf game.
[4508.04 → 4510.96] So every golf game Nintendo has released has had a minimum amount.
[4511.48 → 4514.72] And in the new one, I think you get 100% more or...
[4514.72 → 4515.70] Sorry.
[4516.62 → 4518.94] I think it will be 50% more or 100% more.
[4518.98 → 4519.72] I don't remember how many,
[4519.82 → 4523.70] but there's a massive amount of holes and courses in the golf game.
[4523.86 → 4525.24] Again, not really into that.
[4525.34 → 4527.20] But people were freaking out about the DLC for that,
[4527.28 → 4528.44] so I read up on it a little bit.
[4529.14 → 4530.00] Pretty interesting.
[4530.70 → 4534.60] I'm down with DLC, which is an actual expansion.
[4535.08 → 4535.26] Yeah.
[4535.80 → 4536.44] DLC...
[4536.44 → 4537.92] Because that's what DLC should be.
[4538.04 → 4539.14] DLC is not new.
[4539.14 → 4539.58] No.
[4540.36 → 4544.28] Warcraft 2 Beyond the Dark Portal would have been DLC.
[4544.72 → 4545.64] If it was possible.
[4545.72 → 4546.36] If it was possible.
[4546.60 → 4547.08] Well, it kind of was.
[4547.26 → 4549.20] And I'm totally okay with expansion packs.
[4549.26 → 4549.94] I love expansion packs.
[4549.96 → 4551.78] Age of Empires had DLC.
[4552.18 → 4554.96] Frozen Throne was an amazing expansion pack for Warcraft 3.
[4555.04 → 4555.46] That's right.
[4555.68 → 4556.50] Like, perfect.
[4556.56 → 4561.50] And if DLC legitimately builds on what was already a freestanding game,
[4561.62 → 4564.78] adds more units, adds new campaign, tweaks...
[4564.78 → 4567.28] Actually, I'm not sure how I feel about tweaking balance,
[4567.56 → 4568.72] unless you're adding new units,
[4568.72 → 4570.00] but just...
[4570.00 → 4572.80] If it enhances the game and gives...
[4572.80 → 4573.26] Brood War.
[4573.36 → 4576.64] Gives what originally had its own, you know,
[4576.70 → 4578.24] I feel like I got my money's worth out of it,
[4578.42 → 4580.58] gives it a whole other set of that,
[4580.96 → 4582.08] then I feel pretty good about it.
[4582.14 → 4582.26] Yeah.
[4582.32 → 4582.94] I'm okay with that.
[4583.06 → 4584.72] If it's like horse armour, then...
[4585.46 → 4585.72] Yeah.
[4585.92 → 4586.26] I don't know.
[4586.46 → 4587.22] Well, I think...
[4587.22 → 4588.38] Okay.
[4588.58 → 4589.48] You could say that,
[4589.56 → 4590.96] and they took a lot of flack for that,
[4590.96 → 4595.88] but hasn't the entire DLC industry turned into horse armour?
[4596.52 → 4596.88] Yeah.
[4597.28 → 4598.04] And that's stupid.
[4598.16 → 4599.18] But that's kind of our fault,
[4599.26 → 4599.96] because people buy it.
[4600.00 → 4600.60] I don't buy it,
[4600.64 → 4601.56] but people buy it.
[4602.86 → 4603.74] Just stop,
[4603.90 → 4605.00] and then it'll go away,
[4605.18 → 4607.02] because it won't be worth creating art assets
[4607.02 → 4608.04] that people don't buy.
[4609.24 → 4609.96] All right.
[4611.30 → 4612.96] It's time...
[4612.96 → 4613.92] Dun, dun, dun.
[4614.04 → 4617.24] ...to do the million subscriber giveaway.
[4617.34 → 4618.48] I don't even know if I can help you,
[4618.48 → 4621.22] because my computer isn't going to be really getting internet.
[4621.62 → 4622.06] Oh, hey!
[4622.10 → 4622.46] It's working!
[4622.76 → 4624.26] I'm on the other router.
[4624.84 → 4625.70] I can help you.
[4626.44 → 4627.04] All right.
[4627.16 → 4628.58] So are we doing thatrandom.org,
[4628.62 → 4629.90] or how is this happening?
[4629.92 → 4631.74] Yeah, we're going to random.org this ship.
[4632.32 → 4633.08] So basically,
[4633.32 → 4634.42] we are drawing the winners
[4634.42 → 4636.86] for the custom-built gaming PC,
[4637.02 → 4638.26] which I haven't gotten around to building yet,
[4638.30 → 4638.64] but I will.
[4639.04 → 4640.56] The custom-built gaming PC...
[4640.56 → 4641.34] Isn't it mostly built already?
[4641.52 → 4641.74] No.
[4642.74 → 4643.50] I haven't even touched it.
[4644.18 → 4645.78] The video card's on your bench.
[4645.90 → 4646.90] I thought that was the Racer one.
[4647.16 → 4647.34] No.
[4647.76 → 4648.00] Oh.
[4648.00 → 4649.00] No, that's been torn apart.
[4649.42 → 4649.62] Oh.
[4649.90 → 4650.56] I thought you were just, like,
[4650.62 → 4651.52] rebuilding that up and then...
[4651.52 → 4652.48] We can't ship that case.
[4652.56 → 4654.02] It's, like, got scratches and crap on it.
[4654.14 → 4654.48] Oh, yeah.
[4654.72 → 4655.98] Yeah, it's an engineering sample.
[4656.12 → 4656.58] Yeah, yeah.
[4656.64 → 4656.82] Okay.
[4657.00 → 4657.42] No, no.
[4657.46 → 4658.24] We'll find a case.
[4658.30 → 4658.88] We'll find a good one.
[4658.92 → 4660.32] We have a garage full of cases.
[4661.06 → 4661.78] So, okay.
[4662.02 → 4663.54] So, custom gaming rig,
[4664.24 → 4665.68] Microsoft Surface Pro 3,
[4665.82 → 4667.70] the one that I bought to do my review,
[4667.80 → 4669.34] and because I thought I might end up using it,
[4669.36 → 4670.36] but I didn't really like it that much.
[4670.60 → 4670.90] But you might.
[4671.82 → 4672.18] And,
[4672.78 → 4673.60] whatever our last...
[4673.60 → 4674.46] Oh, what was our last prize?
[4674.50 → 4674.96] I don't even remember.
[4674.96 → 4675.64] Ah, yes.
[4675.88 → 4679.46] We're redrawing the G550J from Highlander
[4679.46 → 4681.90] because the person who won it never responded.
[4682.38 → 4683.84] For, like, the third time, I think.
[4683.90 → 4684.64] Bummer for them.
[4685.02 → 4685.36] All right.
[4685.58 → 4687.04] So, we're going to the thread.
[4687.14 → 4688.30] We're going to draw it live.
[4688.30 → 4690.12] One million subscribers.
[4690.32 → 4691.08] Thank you all.
[4691.24 → 4691.98] Oh, hold on a second.
[4692.18 → 4692.86] I've got to sign out.
[4694.86 → 4695.76] Do-do-do-do-do.
[4697.08 → 4698.02] Back to here.
[4698.20 → 4698.98] Signing out.
[4700.50 → 4701.26] Scrolling down.
[4701.86 → 4702.92] Control-F searching.
[4703.36 → 4703.68] Wow.
[4703.74 → 4704.12] Clicking.
[4704.40 → 4706.22] You are the most helpful person ever today.
[4706.72 → 4708.64] Viewing random forum thread.
[4708.64 → 4709.90] You're back to being dead to me.
[4709.90 → 4710.18] Hey!
[4710.54 → 4711.78] Taking you back off my shirt.
[4711.78 → 4715.68] All right.
[4715.94 → 4721.44] So, the first two are going to go to the first two people who are randomly drawn.
[4721.80 → 4729.82] The third one, we are going to keep drawing until we find someone who is a positively contributing member to the forum.
[4730.00 → 4730.96] How are we judging that?
[4730.96 → 4736.26] So, we're just going to kind of look at them, and if we know who they are, then they win.
[4736.64 → 4737.66] This might be awkward.
[4737.90 → 4738.20] I know.
[4738.44 → 4739.14] We'll figure it out.
[4739.14 → 4740.96] But maybe let's not say positively contributing.
[4741.18 → 4742.18] Let's just say contributing.
[4742.42 → 4742.68] Okay.
[4743.18 → 4747.38] An actual member of the Linus Tech Tips forum that participates.
[4747.46 → 4747.76] Is there a threshold for that?
[4748.48 → 4749.62] Participatory member of the forum.
[4749.86 → 4756.06] Why don't we say, just for the sake of making life a little bit easier for ourselves, why don't we say kind of...
[4756.06 → 4757.10] Post count is sketchy.
[4757.10 → 4757.26] No.
[4757.34 → 4758.50] No, I don't want to use post count.
[4759.34 → 4760.72] Post count doesn't matter at all.
[4760.72 → 4767.96] But we'll kind of do a quick glance at their last few posts and make sure that they're actually trying to participate.
[4768.28 → 4768.50] Okay.
[4768.60 → 4774.52] And I'm not going to be looking at anyone who started participating right when the 1 million subscriber giveaway started,
[4774.52 → 4782.54] because I said that that was going to be a requirement, and that I wanted it to be for people who have already participated without me offering them a laptop.
[4782.88 → 4783.06] Yeah.
[4783.32 → 4783.50] Yeah.
[4783.70 → 4783.94] Okay.
[4784.22 → 4784.58] All right.
[4784.72 → 4785.70] So, let's do the first draw.
[4786.06 → 4786.74] Random.org.
[4787.10 → 4788.74] 1,119.
[4789.24 → 4790.28] Oh, my goodness.
[4790.72 → 4791.96] Min 1.
[4792.20 → 4793.64] 1,119.
[4794.60 → 4795.08] Generate.
[4795.60 → 4799.58] So, now we are going to go to page 742 in the thread.
[4800.22 → 4801.20] Click on that.
[4801.54 → 4801.84] Which?
[4802.04 → 4802.20] This?
[4802.20 → 4802.96] Click on page 1.
[4803.02 → 4803.52] You can do that?
[4803.62 → 4803.82] Yeah.
[4804.10 → 4804.38] And then just...
[4804.38 → 4805.10] Oh, no way.
[4806.10 → 4807.06] That is amazing.
[4807.62 → 4808.06] All right.
[4809.42 → 4810.32] Did you click go?
[4810.32 → 4812.26] I mostly clicked go.
[4812.40 → 4812.64] Okay.
[4812.72 → 4814.04] I think it worked.
[4814.20 → 4814.54] All right.
[4814.90 → 4816.56] This is kind of a big thread.
[4816.76 → 4818.60] I think everyone's looking at the forum.
[4818.88 → 4819.20] Yeah.
[4819.32 → 4824.08] And everyone's probably looking at the forum right now, because that will somehow affect their
[4824.08 → 4825.86] chances of winning, I guess, or something.
[4826.86 → 4828.60] They will be there with us.
[4828.60 → 4829.60] Oh.
[4829.98 → 4830.38] Oh.
[4832.78 → 4833.18] Served.
[4833.54 → 4834.04] Refresh it.
[4834.38 → 4834.50] Yeah.
[4834.84 → 4835.30] Oh.
[4835.92 → 4836.18] Okay.
[4836.22 → 4836.78] What page was it?
[4838.22 → 4838.46] 742.
[4839.88 → 4841.16] Let's make sure I got that right.
[4841.82 → 4842.16] Yes.
[4842.66 → 4842.94] Whoops.
[4842.94 → 4844.84] Yes.
[4845.56 → 4848.04] I don't have a very good memory, especially when I'm sleep-deprived.
[4849.10 → 4850.82] Did you already have the thread loaded up?
[4851.18 → 4851.54] Yeah.
[4851.64 → 4852.30] Or did you load this?
[4852.42 → 4852.80] Okay.
[4854.68 → 4856.28] Everyone went to the forum.
[4857.36 → 4859.42] The forum isn't hosted on Squarespace.
[4859.70 → 4859.88] Yeah.
[4859.94 → 4860.18] I know.
[4860.22 → 4860.40] Right?
[4860.98 → 4861.42] Okay.
[4861.42 → 4861.50] Okay.
[4861.64 → 4866.38] So I really wanted to do this live, but it looks like that is not going to happen.
[4866.50 → 4867.00] I'm sorry.
[4867.22 → 4872.24] We do like to do these draws live just so that you guys can trust us that we...
[4872.24 → 4877.70] We can do a recorded video of it while the camera doesn't stop, and we draw it there because
[4877.70 → 4879.34] that would be way too much production time.
[4879.34 → 4880.48] Where are we even going to release that?
[4881.32 → 4885.18] I guess we can put it unlisted on the channel and link it in the WAN Show doc here or something.
[4885.24 → 4886.12] It would be a fun video.
[4886.60 → 4886.90] Oh.
[4886.96 → 4888.64] I don't want to do a full video for that.
[4890.16 → 4890.36] Okay.
[4890.40 → 4891.52] We'll talk about it offline.
[4892.26 → 4893.08] But okay.
[4893.38 → 4895.86] So in that case, are you even able to do billboards then?
[4896.02 → 4896.30] Yes.
[4896.36 → 4897.06] I emailed you.
[4897.50 → 4898.06] All right.
[4898.20 → 4898.30] Sweet.
[4898.30 → 4900.36] Like right when the show started, so it should be pretty recent.
[4900.36 → 4904.06] Do your LMG thing.
[4905.02 → 4905.58] There we go.
[4905.64 → 4906.04] All right.
[4906.10 → 4906.62] Here we go.
[4906.74 → 4907.38] Featured billboards.
[4907.70 → 4909.50] There's four things, but you only need really two of them.
[4909.58 → 4912.36] But if you download it, because you probably won't be able to view it in your browser, you
[4912.36 → 4912.80] can try.
[4913.18 → 4914.82] But I expect no.
[4916.30 → 4919.56] So there was one choice by the community and there's one choice by the staff.
[4919.66 → 4923.54] I don't know why that happened because I told them considering there were so many entries,
[4923.62 → 4925.54] there should be like way more than one from each.
[4925.54 → 4931.00] But apparently there's one from each, so we're doing one from each for now because I didn't
[4931.00 → 4931.78] notice until today.
[4931.94 → 4933.56] I probably should have checked, so that was my fault.
[4935.24 → 4936.70] At least you owned your mistake.
[4936.84 → 4937.04] Yep.
[4937.72 → 4938.40] All right.
[4938.60 → 4939.96] So slideshow.
[4940.06 → 4943.78] So the first one is by Sage C, and this is Project N64.
[4944.04 → 4946.80] I believe this one was the one chosen by the mods.
[4947.42 → 4948.74] Why is that the slideshow?
[4948.90 → 4949.90] What the heck is this?
[4950.82 → 4951.14] What?
[4953.78 → 4955.68] PowerPoint, why you do?
[4957.44 → 4959.58] Why you do this, PowerPoint?
[4959.58 → 4960.60] That is super deep.
[4960.74 → 4961.76] That better not be the...
[4961.76 → 4963.36] Is it like review slideshow?
[4963.68 → 4965.18] From the beginning, it should be.
[4966.70 → 4967.10] What?
[4967.52 → 4968.26] What are you doing?
[4968.58 → 4969.50] Display settings, maybe.
[4969.60 → 4970.10] Here we go.
[4971.68 → 4972.12] What?
[4972.78 → 4974.50] Oh, that's like presenter view.
[4975.26 → 4976.12] Okay, I get it.
[4976.76 → 4977.04] Book.
[4977.04 → 4980.04] Um...
[4981.36 → 4986.58] It's not...
[4986.58 → 4987.50] It's not a...
[4987.50 → 4987.84] What?
[4989.24 → 4990.82] Oh, hold on a second.
[4992.28 → 4992.80] Uh...
[4992.80 → 4993.92] Wait, where did we get that?
[4993.92 → 4994.50] Hold on one second.
[4994.58 → 4995.70] We're learning how to use PowerPoint.
[4995.88 → 4996.42] We'll be back.
[4996.94 → 4997.26] Yeah.
[4997.38 → 4998.04] Except we're not going anywhere.
[4998.36 → 5000.84] No, I think they had the right one already.
[5001.62 → 5002.34] No, they don't.
[5002.52 → 5004.24] It shouldn't be an extended screen.
[5004.24 → 5004.82] What are they looking at?
[5004.86 → 5005.84] It's a duplicated screen.
[5005.84 → 5006.86] Is it frozen?
[5007.98 → 5009.06] No, I don't think so.
[5009.82 → 5011.08] Try to open your start menu.
[5013.86 → 5014.68] Maybe frozen.
[5015.34 → 5016.08] Not frozen.
[5018.58 → 5021.04] Oh, it's an extended display.
[5021.70 → 5022.82] Why is it an extended display?
[5022.90 → 5023.94] Why is it extended?
[5024.04 → 5025.52] We're supposed to do duplicate displays.
[5025.56 → 5026.40] What is it doing?
[5026.64 → 5027.10] I don't know.
[5027.14 → 5027.54] What is it?
[5027.70 → 5028.10] High?
[5028.10 → 5029.66] This is really weird.
[5029.76 → 5033.10] So we're looking at a presenter view that is not...
[5033.10 → 5035.32] Oh my goodness.
[5035.86 → 5036.26] All right.
[5036.42 → 5039.98] So let's just try previewing it from here.
[5040.16 → 5042.64] This is why we don't make videos about Microsoft software.
[5043.32 → 5044.58] What were they thinking?
[5044.58 → 5045.74] About PowerPoint, I guess.
[5046.54 → 5047.54] Who does make videos about...
[5047.54 → 5049.96] Someone should make a video about PowerPoint because this is ridiculous.
[5049.96 → 5050.72] That would be the most boring video.
[5050.82 → 5052.40] They should present the video from PowerPoint.
[5052.76 → 5055.50] They should just record their screen and have a PowerPoint presentation running.
[5055.50 → 5059.78] I'm sure that people who use PowerPoint all the time...
[5059.78 → 5061.86] Technically, I use PowerPoint all the time.
[5061.98 → 5063.02] I just realized that.
[5063.02 → 5063.38] Are laughing at us right now.
[5063.38 → 5064.46] But I don't use this version.
[5065.06 → 5066.30] So that's my defence.
[5066.40 → 5070.02] I'm sure someone's laughing at us, and I'm sure that they're right, and we're idiots or whatever.
[5070.02 → 5072.62] In the version that I use, it's like super-duper easy.
[5074.80 → 5075.32] Okay.
[5076.50 → 5076.98] Yay.
[5077.80 → 5078.26] All right.
[5078.64 → 5079.26] Line of screen.
[5080.08 → 5080.56] Nope.
[5080.76 → 5082.06] What are we looking at?
[5082.26 → 5083.12] I have no idea.
[5084.34 → 5085.26] Not a clue.
[5085.50 → 5088.68] What is this?
[5088.68 → 5091.50] It's not showing your screen though because you just had a photo viewer up.
[5092.02 → 5092.34] Yeah.
[5092.86 → 5094.32] It's not updating or something.
[5094.84 → 5095.18] Oh, okay.
[5095.18 → 5096.46] That's why I said open your start menu.
[5096.62 → 5097.82] Like it's not updating properly.
[5098.28 → 5099.54] There's something else going on.
[5100.82 → 5101.54] Because it's...
[5101.54 → 5103.68] Yeah, when you open your start menu, it should have shown the start menu.
[5103.92 → 5105.18] Yeah, it's not working.
[5105.18 → 5106.34] Oh, okay.
[5106.50 → 5108.34] Well, that explains a lot now then.
[5108.46 → 5111.06] So let's see if...
[5111.06 → 5113.48] Did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in?
[5114.24 → 5114.48] No.
[5114.48 → 5115.22] No, not yet.
[5116.62 → 5118.84] Let's just see if this does a thing.
[5119.60 → 5121.32] Oh, well...
[5121.32 → 5122.32] Okay, okay, okay.
[5122.52 → 5123.04] New plan.
[5123.18 → 5123.60] New plan.
[5124.74 → 5125.72] Don't worry, you guys.
[5125.88 → 5127.16] We're going to find a way to do this.
[5127.30 → 5127.76] Oh, there you go.
[5127.78 → 5128.14] That'll work.
[5128.14 → 5130.32] I want to do build guides of the week.
[5130.48 → 5130.92] Dang it.
[5131.08 → 5131.32] Month.
[5131.76 → 5132.76] Oh, hold on a second.
[5134.76 → 5135.16] Oh...
[5135.16 → 5136.08] Oh...
[5136.08 → 5136.70] Oh...
[5136.70 → 5137.74] Okay, okay.
[5137.84 → 5139.10] We heard back from NVIDIA.
[5139.54 → 5140.58] Just in time.
[5140.94 → 5143.48] Well, actually, right around the time we were talking about it on the show.
[5144.02 → 5144.48] It is...
[5144.48 → 5144.94] We called it.
[5145.02 → 5145.76] That's all I have to say.
[5145.76 → 5150.22] It is not NVIDIA's intention to restrict support to GeForce PCs.
[5150.74 → 5156.06] The reality is that the quickest path to releasing PC support was to release it through our existing
[5156.06 → 5157.50] GeForce Experience software.
[5157.76 → 5162.68] We are working on a plan to support non-GeForce PCs, but currently cannot commit to a time frame
[5162.68 → 5163.28] for support.
[5163.78 → 5164.28] All right.
[5164.84 → 5165.82] Faith restored.
[5166.56 → 5167.82] Because it made no sense.
[5167.94 → 5170.80] Like, I didn't want to, like, go over it too hard, but it made no sense.
[5170.82 → 5171.74] No, it made no sense.
[5172.08 → 5175.66] But you were saying that there's something in GeForce Experience that it would have to
[5175.66 → 5176.06] be tied to.
[5176.10 → 5176.34] Well, no.
[5176.44 → 5181.40] What I was saying was that maybe, like, I could understand why GeForce Experience might
[5181.40 → 5181.96] be easier.
[5183.76 → 5184.54] We can go back and watch.
[5184.54 → 5185.68] You can watch the archive if you want.
[5185.80 → 5185.96] Okay.
[5186.00 → 5186.84] I never said that...
[5186.84 → 5189.18] I said that the touchpad might not work or something.
[5189.22 → 5190.54] Yeah, but that makes no sense.
[5190.82 → 5191.14] Why not?
[5191.76 → 5192.12] Who knows?
[5192.12 → 5194.98] What does GeForce Experience do that would have anything to do with that?
[5195.02 → 5195.54] Who knows?
[5195.66 → 5199.98] The point is that as a controller, I couldn't see any reason why it wouldn't work.
[5200.04 → 5201.76] So anyway, the point is...
[5201.76 → 5202.38] That's still completely valid.
[5202.54 → 5203.36] None of that happened.
[5203.60 → 5205.08] They just rolled it out through GeForce Experience.
[5205.08 → 5206.50] Right, which makes tons of sense.
[5206.52 → 5208.88] Because that's a convenient way for them to roll driver updates out to people.
[5209.10 → 5210.96] And it was really painless to get it working.
[5211.10 → 5212.78] I just plugged it in, and it worked, which is nice.
[5213.20 → 5213.62] All right.
[5213.72 → 5213.96] Yay.
[5214.06 → 5215.00] Faith restored NVIDIA.
[5215.12 → 5215.94] Good job, you guys.
[5218.08 → 5221.26] Let's go ahead and go back to Luke's email here.
[5221.26 → 5222.98] Which hopefully I can find.
[5223.30 → 5224.42] I can't even see it.
[5224.80 → 5225.90] I get too many emails.
[5226.98 → 5227.44] Top one.
[5227.52 → 5227.74] Top one.
[5227.82 → 5228.08] Top one.
[5228.26 → 5228.66] Top one.
[5228.74 → 5229.22] There we go.
[5229.72 → 5230.90] Future build logs.
[5232.62 → 5233.32] The blue ones.
[5233.36 → 5234.10] Why are there four?
[5234.10 → 5234.56] The blue ones.
[5234.68 → 5234.90] Okay.
[5234.90 → 5237.54] My brain is exploding.
[5237.94 → 5238.44] That's okay.
[5238.66 → 5238.94] All right.
[5239.02 → 5240.06] Let's do this one first.
[5240.50 → 5241.26] Oh, did you click both of them?
[5242.22 → 5244.44] So what we'll have to do...
[5244.44 → 5245.10] Screen region capture.
[5245.30 → 5245.92] Is...
[5245.92 → 5246.26] Yeah.
[5246.36 → 5247.76] We'll just do screen region capture.
[5248.52 → 5251.44] And then we will...
[5251.44 → 5252.20] Oh, I don't know.
[5252.34 → 5254.78] Let's pick this scene or something.
[5255.00 → 5255.14] Oh.
[5255.30 → 5255.90] And...
[5255.90 → 5257.16] Add screen region.
[5258.28 → 5258.68] All right.
[5258.68 → 5258.86] Nope.
[5258.94 → 5259.18] It's back.
[5259.18 → 5261.30] Stream section for a little bit here, guys.
[5264.50 → 5264.74] And...
[5264.74 → 5266.40] Slideshow from beginning.
[5266.64 → 5268.24] So now we're just hoping that it's working?
[5268.78 → 5269.06] Yeah.
[5269.52 → 5269.78] Cool.
[5270.04 → 5270.80] It's probably working.
[5270.96 → 5271.60] Project N...
[5271.60 → 5271.90] Okay.
[5272.02 → 5273.36] Do you want to give the background for this?
[5273.82 → 5274.96] Uh, project N64.
[5275.34 → 5275.94] Well, let's just...
[5275.94 → 5277.14] I think they got that much so far.
[5277.22 → 5277.86] By Sage.
[5277.90 → 5278.48] Let's go with them.
[5278.60 → 5279.06] Let's go with them.
[5279.20 → 5280.76] So this is all the included components.
[5281.08 → 5284.02] Um, which is not super important in my opinion.
[5284.02 → 5287.26] You can check out all the included components and all that kind of stuff if you go to the
[5287.26 → 5287.36] actual build logs.
[5287.36 → 5289.32] Are you hating on his inclusion of a broken N64?
[5289.96 → 5290.18] No.
[5290.24 → 5291.96] I think that's pretty cool because that was my...
[5291.96 → 5293.88] Actually, this is an interesting discussion.
[5294.18 → 5297.74] That was my favourite part about listing the system specs of my mineral oil PC was when
[5297.74 → 5298.68] they asked for a case.
[5299.20 → 5299.48] Right.
[5300.04 → 5301.68] I was always like, fish tank.
[5302.50 → 5302.82] Yeah.
[5303.48 → 5304.22] So that's...
[5304.22 → 5304.62] Yeah, I know.
[5304.74 → 5305.40] That's pretty cool.
[5305.58 → 5310.34] But the point of the build logs isn't necessarily like, oh, he used AMD instead of Intel.
[5310.52 → 5310.72] Like, blah.
[5310.76 → 5311.72] That's not really the point.
[5311.72 → 5313.76] So I don't really want to spend too much time on this.
[5313.76 → 5314.06] Oh, sweet.
[5314.78 → 5315.96] This is the point.
[5316.26 → 5318.68] The awesomeness that is this computer.
[5319.86 → 5320.68] So, yeah.
[5321.06 → 5325.66] He shows in the beginning where he just kind of tore apart the N64 and started removing
[5325.66 → 5327.72] things, then putting in his motherboard and whatnot.
[5328.02 → 5333.96] And then if we move on forward, you can see the end shots, which are amazing.
[5334.80 → 5335.28] Wow.
[5335.64 → 5336.54] That's ridiculous.
[5337.50 → 5338.66] That's fantastic.
[5339.82 → 5340.84] Pretty freaking cool.
[5340.84 → 5345.42] I've seen some old console build a computer into it builds.
[5345.56 → 5349.52] But this one is kind of incredible, even having seen those in the past.
[5349.54 → 5350.30] That's spotless.
[5350.62 → 5351.16] Yeah, it is.
[5351.86 → 5352.46] Extremely clean.
[5352.56 → 5354.38] Usually you see some sort of breakage.
[5355.26 → 5356.72] And this is extremely well done.
[5357.88 → 5358.58] All right.
[5358.74 → 5359.38] Super awesome.
[5359.38 → 5362.38] So I believe that one was voted for by...
[5362.38 → 5363.72] He stole my idea.
[5363.86 → 5364.36] Yeah, no.
[5364.90 → 5367.48] I believe that one was voted for by the mods.
[5367.64 → 5369.96] Someone in the chat was like, but he stole my idea.
[5370.24 → 5371.92] I'm like, yeah, it's also been done before.
[5372.14 → 5372.30] Yeah.
[5372.34 → 5376.26] The idea of building a computer in an old console is not really new.
[5376.40 → 5376.64] No.
[5376.80 → 5377.46] It's awesome.
[5377.54 → 5378.86] And he did an perfect job.
[5378.86 → 5380.80] But it probably wasn't your original idea.
[5381.04 → 5383.62] And yeah, more people will do it in the future.
[5383.98 → 5384.26] All right.
[5384.32 → 5384.46] Sorry.
[5384.50 → 5388.42] I'm just trying to be careful not to leak anyone's personal information here.
[5388.78 → 5389.96] I would be happy about that.
[5390.12 → 5390.50] What was it?
[5390.62 → 5390.90] Guessed.
[5391.06 → 5391.54] Here we go.
[5392.00 → 5392.78] All right.
[5392.88 → 5394.36] So we've got our second one here.
[5394.46 → 5399.16] So just in case you didn't know, water-cooled PC desk mod with car sound system.
[5399.16 → 5402.94] This one's got some pretty nice specs.
[5403.26 → 5405.10] Two 780 Tis and SLI.
[5405.74 → 5406.68] Lots of storage.
[5406.80 → 5407.32] Holy crap.
[5408.24 → 5409.24] Wow, that is a lot of storage.
[5409.30 → 5412.94] Seven terabytes of storage plus the SSDs.
[5413.26 → 5414.96] Although I don't think he technically...
[5414.96 → 5416.96] No, he didn't make it into the 10 terabyte thread.
[5417.32 → 5417.78] Yeah, bummer.
[5418.46 → 5419.04] Close enough.
[5419.04 → 5423.90] And from what I've heard, you're allowed to be a heathen and post in the 10 terabyte thread
[5423.90 → 5425.04] even if you don't have 10 terabytes.
[5425.34 → 5426.10] Oh, no.
[5426.10 → 5428.52] Just to hang out with everyone if you want, I guess.
[5428.52 → 5430.92] I should post our server.
[5431.08 → 5435.64] When we get our new Seagate drives, we're getting some super high cap Seagate drives
[5435.64 → 5440.66] for our server that are going to make us maybe near the top of the 10 terabyte plus thread.
[5440.90 → 5442.34] Will we not be in red anymore?
[5442.70 → 5443.56] Because that would be nice.
[5443.74 → 5444.12] I'm sorry?
[5444.24 → 5446.18] We've been riding the red line for like months.
[5446.70 → 5448.26] It's been relatively okay lately.
[5448.38 → 5451.72] I expanded it to 21 terabytes, and we offloaded four terabytes the other day.
[5451.74 → 5452.10] There you go.
[5452.16 → 5452.40] Nice.
[5453.10 → 5453.62] All right.
[5454.30 → 5454.64] Wow.
[5454.64 → 5459.96] So it looks extremely similar to the NVIDIA desk that we went to go see.
[5460.20 → 5460.90] Yeah, that's true.
[5461.12 → 5462.40] Not exactly the same at all.
[5462.58 → 5462.74] Yeah.
[5462.86 → 5465.68] No, but the horizontal reservoirs.
[5466.00 → 5470.78] The NVIDIA one had two completely separate PCs, one on either side, which didn't make a
[5470.78 → 5473.08] ton of sense to me, but whatever.
[5474.36 → 5474.92] They're NVIDIA.
[5474.98 → 5476.04] They do what they want, I guess.
[5476.62 → 5478.04] These dual power supplies in there.
[5478.16 → 5479.16] Pretty sick looking system.
[5480.80 → 5481.66] Oh, yeah.
[5482.10 → 5483.28] That is super cool.
[5483.42 → 5486.42] Gets a lot more sick than we had originally thought.
[5486.86 → 5488.26] I'm face roll.
[5488.48 → 5489.76] Love all this.
[5489.76 → 5492.34] Got a couple optical drives in because you can.
[5492.86 → 5497.64] Got like in dash console stuff in here because you can.
[5497.78 → 5499.34] Fan controller because you can.
[5499.92 → 5505.12] Pretty much everything about this build is because you can.
[5505.38 → 5506.06] Sick build.
[5506.24 → 5506.92] Very, very cool.
[5509.24 → 5509.68] So.
[5509.90 → 5510.34] Awesome.
[5511.20 → 5513.78] I think that pretty much wraps it up for the WAN show, you guys.
[5513.86 → 5515.00] Thank you for tuning in.
[5515.50 → 5517.84] All over 5,000 of you.
[5517.84 → 5519.62] I think we had around 5,500 peak.
[5519.72 → 5521.08] You guys are fantastic.
[5521.34 → 5522.20] We appreciate it.
[5522.42 → 5523.60] Sorry about the problems at the beginning.
[5523.86 → 5524.86] Yeah, we're sorry.
[5525.12 → 5529.56] One thing to note is that our folding team and our brink teams are super awesome, so you
[5529.56 → 5532.72] should go join them if you want to contribute your compute power to a good cause.
[5533.54 → 5534.78] They're both doing extremely well.
[5534.82 → 5538.02] I don't have numbers offhand here, which Wailer's probably going to stab me for.
[5538.48 → 5539.42] I'll join your brink team.
[5540.08 → 5540.36] Did you?
[5540.44 → 5541.06] No, you haven't.
[5541.56 → 5542.04] No, I haven't.
[5542.12 → 5544.00] There are a few mods that are on it, and I'm on it.
[5544.64 → 5547.08] I'm doing pretty good, but I'm not at the top.
[5547.08 → 5548.76] I think my dad might still be at the top.
[5548.86 → 5549.04] Really?
[5549.14 → 5550.38] Or someone's finally passed him.
[5550.42 → 5550.82] That's awesome.
[5550.92 → 5551.34] I'm not sure.
[5551.40 → 5554.36] We've got to get him some more hardware so he can stay there, which we will be doing soon.
[5554.42 → 5556.76] His dad helped us with the whole room liquid cooling thing, so.
[5557.24 → 5561.32] Yeah, and yes, we will make videos about it, and no, they're not ready yet.
[5561.58 → 5562.10] They're not even close.
[5562.10 → 5563.04] And they're probably not coming soon.
[5563.36 → 5563.56] Yeah.
[5563.90 → 5569.94] Ed's on vacation for at least another week, and then when he gets back, if he has time,
[5570.46 → 5571.96] then he will start working on that project.
[5572.68 → 5573.04] Start?
[5573.12 → 5573.80] He hasn't started yet?
[5573.80 → 5574.44] Not really.
[5574.72 → 5575.98] Like, he's done some, but not.
[5576.34 → 5576.88] It's not.
[5576.94 → 5578.34] And there's quite a bit of footage to go through.
[5578.40 → 5579.68] People are yelling about the giveaway again.
[5579.98 → 5581.40] I think we already tried.
[5582.08 → 5584.84] I don't think the forum is back up, but I could check.
[5587.24 → 5588.88] Looks like no.
[5589.32 → 5589.84] Looks like not.
[5589.86 → 5590.44] I'm sorry, guys.
[5590.52 → 5592.46] We'll have to post the giveaway shortly.
[5593.10 → 5593.28] Yep.
[5593.40 → 5593.74] All right.
[5594.50 → 5596.96] Thanks again for watching, and as always, don't forget to subscribe.
[5597.46 → 5598.08] Lime's Tech Tips.
[5598.34 → 5598.66] Yay!
[5598.66 → 5601.94] That was a different ending to the WAN show that we don't normally do.
[5602.80 → 5603.58] Yes, it was.
[5603.84 → 5605.50] I couldn't think of anything else.
[5607.62 → 5608.80] Forum does seem to be back.
[5608.94 → 5609.26] Oh, no.
[5609.34 → 5609.64] There it goes.
[5609.78 → 5610.10] Never mind.
[5612.06 → 5615.80] Because the thing is, it came back up, and then everyone was like, give away, and went back.
[5616.30 → 5617.18] And then it went back down.
[5617.60 → 5617.86] Right.
[5618.12 → 5618.60] It's like, oh.
[5618.60 → 5624.24] Oh, there's no audio for the outro, and also I didn't even have the thing on.
[5625.14 → 5627.34] Yay, we carried a couch and went through a swamp.
[5627.58 → 5628.02] It happened.
[5628.14 → 5628.92] You'll have to trust us.
[5629.02 → 5629.18] Woo!
[5631.66 → 5632.12] True.
[5634.26 → 5634.74] True.
[5636.74 → 5637.18] True.
[5645.72 → 5645.74] True.
[5645.74 → 5645.76] True.
