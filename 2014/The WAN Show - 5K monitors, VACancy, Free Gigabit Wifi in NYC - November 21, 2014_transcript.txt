[0.00 --> 12.00]  We are live! Hooray! Welcome to the show! We both have new attire today, as you may or may not have noticed. Luke has...
[12.00 --> 19.00]  My wonderful dolphin Christmas sweater. That thing that he's wearing. The best dolphin Christmas sweater ever.
[19.00 --> 25.00]  And I have what I think is probably gonna be our most popular t-shirt design ever.
[25.00 --> 32.00]  Good reason. Well, I kind of do too. Both rocking the Keep On Diggin' shirts.
[32.00 --> 36.00]  And then, truthfully, I actually have a horrible Christmas sweater too.
[36.00 --> 45.00]  So it's getting to be that time of year. And here we go. Oh yeah! Shark Christmas.
[45.00 --> 47.00]  So Shark Christmas and Dolphin Christmas.
[47.00 --> 53.00]  So I think obviously the first thing we're gonna talk about on the show today is Sharks vs Dolphins.
[53.00 --> 55.00]  Who is superior?
[55.00 --> 62.00]  Well, I think sharks would be more superior in like a physical, aggressive kind of manner.
[62.00 --> 67.00]  And then Dolphins are more superior in like the logic and apparently sex kind of manner.
[67.00 --> 69.00]  Better at sex.
[69.00 --> 72.00]  Well, aren't they the only other mammal that has sex for fun?
[72.00 --> 76.00]  I think this is the... No, I think it's pigs actually. I think this is the fastest...
[76.00 --> 81.00]  No, pigs have half an hour fun times. But I don't think they actually do it for like recreation.
[81.00 --> 88.00]  Now we're gonna have to consult the Twitch chat because if there's anything I would expect the Twitch chat to be an expert on...
[88.00 --> 92.00]  It would be... It would be animal sex.
[92.00 --> 95.00]  Oh no. Oh man.
[95.00 --> 101.00]  Someone just said dolphins can kill sharks. Maybe. But like, no one's like, oh no, there's a dolphin!
[101.00 --> 109.00]  This is true. I was actually hoping you didn't know that. Dolphins can be a big problem if they get aggressive because they're super powerful.
[109.00 --> 113.00]  Well that's why whenever you go like swimming with dolphins you only swim with the female dolphins.
[113.00 --> 114.00]  Yes.
[114.00 --> 116.00]  You don't swim with the male dolphins because they'll wreck you.
[116.00 --> 122.00]  Okay, we've got a lot of people saying that they're right. Luke's right. Dolphins have sex for pleasure.
[122.00 --> 132.00]  Apparently... Okay. I don't know if Twitch chat knows as much as they think they know. Dolphins kill more people a year than sharks and rape them.
[132.00 --> 139.00]  Um, I'm thinking that's not actually what happens. It's possible they kill people. It's the second part that I'm a little uncertain about.
[139.00 --> 144.00]  There's, there's, there's... Yeah, I'm not gonna get into it. But there's, there's some stuff for that second one.
[144.00 --> 147.00]  Yeah, I'm sure there's, I'm sure there's an incident.
[147.00 --> 149.00]  But, um...
[149.00 --> 156.00]  Anyways, moving on. We have some pretty cool topics this week that don't have to do with sharks or dolphins, actually. Like, not at all.
[156.00 --> 158.00]  Yay, dolphins. Christmas shark, Christmas dolphin.
[158.00 --> 164.00]  Um, so some CSGO vac pros. Uh, CSGO pros got vac banned. There we go. I can talk.
[164.00 --> 165.00]  Got vac banned!
[165.00 --> 166.00]  I got vac pros!
[166.00 --> 167.00]  Vac proed!
[167.00 --> 169.00]  What? Um, anyways, we'll talk about that more later.
[169.00 --> 171.00]  CSGO pro!
[171.00 --> 175.00]  CSGO pro and it's like a little dude with a deagle, but it's actually just a GoPro.
[175.00 --> 181.00]  And now that we've started this, it's only a matter of time until some, like, counter-terrorist agent starts...
[181.00 --> 183.00]  Is that, is that me? Hey, hey, turn off.
[183.00 --> 184.00]  Look at this new...
[184.00 --> 189.00]  It's only a matter of time until some, like, counter-terrorism agent starts wearing a GoPro on all his ops.
[189.00 --> 191.00]  CSGO pro.
[191.00 --> 194.00]  Just becomes a YouTube sensation immediately.
[194.00 --> 204.00]  Anyways, also, BitTorrent is introducing some possible, if you want them to be there, pay gates, which pay a lot more to the contributing artist than most other services.
[204.00 --> 211.00]  Dell's 5K monitor is rumored to be coming in at a much lower price than we had originally anticipated.
[211.00 --> 217.00]  I'm guessing they got somewhat surprised by Apple's pricing of the iMac Retina 5K.
[217.00 --> 226.00]  And then Origin PC, it looks like, I'm assuming, I actually don't know if it's going to be a limited time offer, but it sounds like it.
[226.00 --> 235.00]  For their fifth anniversary, they are going to be selling their cases, both the mid-tower and the full tower, stand alone.
[235.00 --> 247.00]  So you don't actually have to buy an Origin PC in order to get that pretty fantastic Genesis and Millennium case that allows your motherboard to be oriented five different ways.
[247.00 --> 248.00]  Four different ways.
[248.00 --> 251.00]  There is no additional dimension that the case creates.
[251.00 --> 253.00]  It goes, like, flat.
[253.00 --> 257.00]  You don't have the side panel and it just comes flat.
[257.00 --> 258.00]  You just take both side panels off.
[258.00 --> 261.00]  So it's like, kind of a test bench, but not really.
[261.00 --> 265.00]  And if you've got it going fast enough, you could probably get it to lift off.
[265.00 --> 266.00]  Flying case.
[266.00 --> 270.00]  Put jets on the back and put some little case wheels on the bottom and just hope it works.
[270.00 --> 272.00]  People are complaining about the background noise.
[272.00 --> 278.00]  The window's open because it's hot in here and we're wearing Christmas sweaters because tis the season to sweat buckets.
[278.00 --> 281.00]  Because we're in BC, so there's no snow.
[281.00 --> 282.00]  Oh yeah, there's audio.
[282.00 --> 283.00]  I'm just singing for fun now.
[283.00 --> 284.00]  Alright.
[284.00 --> 306.00]  Our sponsors this week are Lynda.com, the fun place to learn.
[306.00 --> 308.00]  Look how much fun she's having.
[308.00 --> 309.00]  That's Lynda.
[309.00 --> 312.00]  You can have that much fun online.
[312.00 --> 313.00]  I have that much fun online.
[313.00 --> 316.00]  Actually, I think there are sites where you can have a lot more fun than that online.
[316.00 --> 317.00]  But this is educational fun.
[317.00 --> 319.00]  I have an adequate amount of fun online.
[319.00 --> 321.00]  Also, 5-4 Club.
[321.00 --> 335.00]  They are going to be reminding you guys, or I guess I'm going to be reminding you guys on their behalf, about their sweet, fantastic, amazing giveaway that's like, actually the craziest clothing giveaway we've ever done.
[335.00 --> 336.00]  Kind of awesome.
[336.00 --> 337.00]  Well, yeah.
[337.00 --> 338.00]  We haven't done many clothing giveaways.
[338.00 --> 339.00]  We haven't done many clothing giveaways.
[339.00 --> 342.00]  We have done a few, I guess, if we like throw shirts out.
[342.00 --> 343.00]  Yeah, actually, okay.
[343.00 --> 344.00]  I have done clothing giveaways.
[344.00 --> 345.00]  I have actually thrown shirts at events.
[345.00 --> 346.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[346.00 --> 347.00]  Mainly the paintball one.
[347.00 --> 348.00]  Yeah, and at NCIX events.
[348.00 --> 349.00]  Oh.
[349.00 --> 350.00]  I have thrown many shirts actually.
[350.00 --> 351.00]  Okay.
[351.00 --> 353.00]  So, that is potentially not the biggest clothing giveaway I've ever purchased.
[353.00 --> 354.00]  No, I think it would be still.
[354.00 --> 355.00]  I think it still would be.
[355.00 --> 359.00]  If you argue that a swag shirt is only worth the actual cost of printing it.
[359.00 --> 366.00]  And with the swag shirts, like if you caught four of them, it's not really as helpful.
[366.00 --> 367.00]  Yeah, it's not a wardrobe.
[367.00 --> 368.00]  No.
[368.00 --> 369.00]  Unless your name is Luke.
[369.00 --> 370.00]  Well, yes.
[370.00 --> 372.00]  But then I do have different ones of all my swag shirts.
[372.00 --> 373.00]  You would wear two of the same ones.
[373.00 --> 374.00]  Yeah, it's not a wardrobe.
[374.00 --> 375.00]  No.
[375.00 --> 376.00]  Unless your name is Luke.
[376.00 --> 377.00]  Well, yes.
[377.00 --> 379.00]  But then I do have different ones of all my swag shirts.
[379.00 --> 380.00]  You would wear two of the same one.
[380.00 --> 381.00]  Probably.
[381.00 --> 382.00]  I do have two of the same ones.
[382.00 --> 383.00]  They would both be in the rotation.
[383.00 --> 384.00]  They are.
[384.00 --> 385.00]  You know the like teal blue twitch shirt?
[385.00 --> 386.00]  Yes, I do.
[386.00 --> 387.00]  I have two of those.
[387.00 --> 388.00]  Okay.
[388.00 --> 389.00]  I like that shirt.
[389.00 --> 390.00]  That doesn't surprise me.
[390.00 --> 391.00]  It's good.
[391.00 --> 392.00]  I'm glad you have two because you'd probably just wear it twice as often if you didn't
[392.00 --> 393.00]  have two and then you'd smell.
[393.00 --> 394.00]  Yeah.
[394.00 --> 395.00]  All right.
[395.00 --> 396.00]  Let's get into our first topic.
[396.00 --> 397.00]  I don't know if you're going to be a little bit of a swag shirt.
[397.00 --> 398.00]  I don't know if you're going to be a little bit of a swag shirt.
[398.00 --> 399.00]  Yeah, I don't know if you're going to be a little bit of a swag shirt.
[399.00 --> 400.00]  I don't know if you're a little bit of a swag shirt.
[400.00 --> 401.00]  That doesn't surprise me.
[401.00 --> 402.00]  It's good.
[402.00 --> 404.00]  I'm glad you have two because you'd probably just wear it twice as often if you didn't
[404.00 --> 406.00]  have two and then you'd smell.
[406.00 --> 407.00]  Yeah.
[407.00 --> 408.00]  All right.
[408.00 --> 409.00]  Let's get into our first topic of the day.
[409.00 --> 413.00]  So this was posted by Tank Slayer on the forum and there's actually a lot of different
[413.00 --> 418.00]  sources for this one including TalkAndroid.com but that's the one we're going to fire up
[418.00 --> 419.00]  here.
[419.00 --> 420.00]  Excuse me.
[420.00 --> 421.00]  It's actually xTankSlayerX.
[421.00 --> 422.00]  Yeah, I don't care.
[422.00 --> 423.00]  So.
[423.00 --> 428.00]  Oneplus not solving issues with defective devices ignoring RMA resources.
[428.00 --> 435.00]  Now the article has been updated with Oneplus' statement that they are working on growing
[435.00 --> 442.00]  their team and expanding their capacity for customer service related stuff but that doesn't
[442.00 --> 448.00]  change that some of these testimonials are pretty condemning.
[448.00 --> 451.00]  You know what they could do to completely solve this problem?
[451.00 --> 455.00]  They should just have their RMA system like a lottery.
[455.00 --> 462.00]  So like you get invites to be able to RMA your phone.
[462.00 --> 464.00]  So like you sign up on their website.
[464.00 --> 465.00]  Oh wow.
[465.00 --> 466.00]  You have to already.
[466.00 --> 467.00]  Phone warranty lottery.
[467.00 --> 468.00]  Yeah.
[468.00 --> 472.00]  So your serial number just gets assigned an arbitrary warranty period.
[472.00 --> 477.00]  So some people get like a 10 year warranty on their phone and others get like 48 hours.
[477.00 --> 479.00]  And it just averages out to you.
[479.00 --> 482.00]  Could you advertise a one year warranty on your phone?
[482.00 --> 483.00]  If it's an average warranty.
[483.00 --> 485.00]  If it was an average warranty.
[485.00 --> 489.00]  Someone gets like a 100 year warranty and everyone else gets a couple hours and they just hope
[489.00 --> 491.00]  that that dude just throws the phone away after a while.
[491.00 --> 492.00]  Yeah.
[492.00 --> 496.00]  So it's no secret that we're not huge fans of the way Oneplus has conducted themselves since
[496.00 --> 499.00]  their inception not very long ago.
[499.00 --> 502.00]  It's amazing how many people send me Oneplus one invites.
[502.00 --> 503.00]  Do you want a Oneplus one?
[503.00 --> 504.00]  Invites.
[504.00 --> 508.00]  I have some people just email them to me without even asking if I want them and I'm just like
[508.00 --> 510.00]  do you have any idea how many of these I've gotten?
[510.00 --> 513.00]  If I wanted a Oneplus one I'd have bought one by now.
[513.00 --> 516.00]  It's really not that hard to get an invite if you really want one.
[516.00 --> 524.00]  Especially now where they're not only accepting invite customers but they're even opening it
[524.00 --> 528.00]  up for pre-orders from time to time whenever they do production runs at the Oppo factory.
[528.00 --> 532.00]  So anyway what happened was I used her on Reddit and stated that he was being helped to fix
[532.00 --> 533.00]  his audio issues.
[533.00 --> 537.00]  And when a flash of his phone did not help customer service apparently ignored his RMA
[537.00 --> 541.00]  request and after 11 days he posted his concerns on Reddit.
[541.00 --> 545.00]  So the statement from Oneplus is we prioritize the experience of our users above all else.
[545.00 --> 548.00]  Our team is growing rapidly to et cetera et cetera et cetera et cetera.
[548.00 --> 554.00]  If you guys want to discuss this more actually the thread on Linus Tech Tips Forum is one of
[554.00 --> 560.00]  the more I don't know just generally it's a really really good it's a really good thread.
[560.00 --> 565.00]  People being very respectful having balanced discussion bringing lots of fat look at look
[565.00 --> 567.00]  at look at ghost he's all on top of his stuff.
[567.00 --> 568.00]  It's a bot.
[568.00 --> 569.00]  It's awesome.
[569.00 --> 570.00]  It's a bot?
[570.00 --> 571.00]  Yeah look bot.
[571.00 --> 572.00]  How does that work?
[572.00 --> 576.00]  So when you post something specifically when your account posts something and then it has
[576.00 --> 580.00]  HTTP colon slash slash in it that bot will just nuke the chat.
[580.00 --> 581.00]  How do I not know about these things?
[581.00 --> 583.00]  Because ghost is awesome.
[583.00 --> 587.00]  Because like I've been spamming it and you guys didn't tell me to stop spamming it.
[587.00 --> 588.00]  Well it's fairly new.
[588.00 --> 589.00]  Ah okay.
[589.00 --> 590.00]  Yeah.
[590.00 --> 594.00]  Ghost got really tired of me not instigating like an actual chat bot.
[594.00 --> 597.00]  So he's like I'm gonna just make my own.
[597.00 --> 598.00]  So he did.
[598.00 --> 599.00]  Good job ghost.
[599.00 --> 600.00]  You are the man.
[600.00 --> 605.00]  And like the best part is that I'm not gonna go over like all the different things that it does.
[605.00 --> 612.00]  But certain things that it does are drastically better than all the free bots out there and are like reasons why I've been holding off because I'm like oh they just suck.
[612.00 --> 613.00]  Right.
[613.00 --> 615.00]  So yeah he solved those too.
[615.00 --> 616.00]  Cool.
[616.00 --> 617.00]  It's kinda great.
[617.00 --> 618.00]  Alright let's move into our next topic.
[618.00 --> 619.00]  Well this is cool.
[619.00 --> 624.00]  This means there's actually a point in me posting things like the source links for the stuff that we're about to talk about.
[624.00 --> 625.00]  Oh and it didn't work.
[625.00 --> 626.00]  It doesn't have an HTTP colon slash slash.
[626.00 --> 627.00]  It does.
[627.00 --> 628.00]  It does.
[628.00 --> 629.00]  Balls.
[629.00 --> 630.00]  Well alright.
[630.00 --> 631.00]  It didn't work that time.
[631.00 --> 633.00]  Ghost you are hereby.
[633.00 --> 635.00]  No it did something else.
[635.00 --> 638.00]  You are hereby deducted one internet cookie.
[638.00 --> 641.00]  But it's okay because you earned six internet cookies for the last thing you did.
[641.00 --> 642.00]  I might have missed something.
[642.00 --> 645.00]  Alright so this is Kisa's KISS connectivity.
[645.00 --> 647.00]  Oh it only does it every 90 seconds.
[647.00 --> 649.00]  This was posted by Dismo on the forum.
[649.00 --> 652.00]  I'm gonna go ahead and pop this up on my screen here anyway.
[652.00 --> 653.00]  It has a cool down.
[653.00 --> 654.00]  I'm sorry?
[654.00 --> 656.00]  Why does it have a cool down?
[656.00 --> 658.00]  You can only do it once every 90 seconds.
[658.00 --> 659.00]  Oh alright then.
[659.00 --> 662.00]  Oh it's probably so if you spam the crap out of it it doesn't.
[662.00 --> 663.00]  It's probably to keep me from getting banned.
[663.00 --> 664.00]  There we go.
[664.00 --> 665.00]  From banning myself.
[665.00 --> 666.00]  Alright.
[666.00 --> 667.00]  So this.
[667.00 --> 671.00]  I mean I think the headline is a little bit sensationalist.
[671.00 --> 673.00]  Mr. Eric McBride over at Android Authority.
[673.00 --> 678.00]  I don't think that KISS connectivity will make cords obsolete.
[678.00 --> 686.00]  But I do agree that I mean if kissing made cords obsolete what would we need the internet
[686.00 --> 687.00]  for?
[687.00 --> 688.00]  You could just kiss girls in real life.
[688.00 --> 689.00]  Well I guess.
[689.00 --> 690.00]  Or boys.
[690.00 --> 691.00]  Yeah.
[691.00 --> 692.00]  Yeah whichever.
[692.00 --> 698.00]  Anyway the point is that this is we don't really have a ton of confirmation about exactly
[698.00 --> 700.00]  how the heck it works.
[700.00 --> 702.00]  But what they have said is that.
[702.00 --> 704.00]  That still wouldn't solve long distance relationships.
[704.00 --> 705.00]  I'm sorry?
[705.00 --> 706.00]  Long distance?
[706.00 --> 707.00]  Okay.
[707.00 --> 712.00]  The connectors used in Kisa's wireless KISS connectivity are currently able to transfer up to six gigs of data per second.
[712.00 --> 719.00]  To put this in perspective the latest Wi-Fi standard can handle up to 1.35 gigs a second.
[719.00 --> 721.00]  And that's very theoretical.
[721.00 --> 724.00]  I've never seen it go anywhere near that fast.
[724.00 --> 727.00]  And that's using a bridge.
[727.00 --> 731.00]  Or like a media bridge and a high speed router.
[731.00 --> 736.00]  As opposed to a router and then the kinds of weak sauce clients that typically people are using.
[736.00 --> 741.00]  So this they showed off transferring a 1080p movie file.
[741.00 --> 744.00]  Although we don't actually have confirmation of the exact size of the file.
[744.00 --> 748.00]  But I would guess it's in the given that it did it in five seconds.
[748.00 --> 751.00]  I would guess that it was in the six gigs range.
[751.00 --> 753.00]  But it could be anywhere from two and a half to twelve gigs.
[753.00 --> 760.00]  And that would translate to 512 megabytes per second to 2457 megabytes per second.
[760.00 --> 762.00]  Which is bananas.
[762.00 --> 763.00]  Minstrous.
[763.00 --> 764.00]  Did it hold on a second?
[764.00 --> 765.00]  No, I did the math wrong there.
[765.00 --> 768.00]  It should have been ten seconds to be whatever the speed I said was.
[768.00 --> 769.00]  Okay, anyway.
[769.00 --> 772.00]  Somewhere between 512 megabytes to 2457.
[772.00 --> 775.00]  And it can only do it a couple of millimeters away right now.
[775.00 --> 780.00]  So we're not talking about like, you know, I'm just like this.
[780.00 --> 781.00]  And I'm like, boop-dee-boop-dee-boop.
[781.00 --> 786.00]  And it goes over to his phone, you know, as fast as a USB 3 wired connection.
[786.00 --> 791.00]  We're talking about more like an NFC touch style and like, make sure you get it aligned just right.
[791.00 --> 792.00]  Yeah.
[792.00 --> 793.00]  Kind of arrangement.
[793.00 --> 797.00]  The initial demo of the technology was by their CEO, Eric Almgren.
[797.00 --> 800.00]  And they claim that, um...
[800.00 --> 803.00]  No, I already said that.
[803.00 --> 804.00]  So...
[804.00 --> 805.00]  Whoa.
[805.00 --> 806.00]  Oh yeah, it was touch screen.
[806.00 --> 814.00]  So I don't know what else there's to really say about this other than the one big problem is that it doesn't use any kind of existing technology.
[814.00 --> 819.00]  Like one of the ways that we've seen NFC file transfers before in the past is things like...
[819.00 --> 820.00]  And I'm holding up an iPhone.
[820.00 --> 821.00]  Haha, NFC derp.
[821.00 --> 823.00]  I can pay for things.
[823.00 --> 824.00]  Yeah, thank you.
[824.00 --> 833.00]  Um, so one of the ways we've seen NFC file transfers implemented in the past is with an NFC handshake and then a direct WiFi connection, for example.
[833.00 --> 838.00]  Whereas KISS connectivity is not going to rely on any kind of existing connection.
[838.00 --> 841.00]  It will need a dedicated chip just for this.
[841.00 --> 845.00]  Although it looks like they're already in the process of working with a couple of large OEMs.
[845.00 --> 851.00]  Dell is probably going to be one of them given that one of their devices was used for the demo.
[851.00 --> 854.00]  And then Samsung and Intel are also investors.
[854.00 --> 857.00]  So that's already some pretty heavyweight players.
[857.00 --> 863.00]  Even if just Samsung rolls it out, that is a huge chunk of the smartphone market that could be enabled with this technology.
[863.00 --> 866.00]  I'd like to see it in palm rests of laptops.
[866.00 --> 867.00]  Yes.
[867.00 --> 869.00]  Did you read my comment and steal it?
[869.00 --> 871.00]  I had a...
[871.00 --> 876.00]  That was going to be my whole thing that I was going to actually be able to talk about.
[876.00 --> 877.00]  I put an additional bullet...
[877.00 --> 880.00]  See, I'm not going to put bullet points in the dock anymore.
[880.00 --> 885.00]  I put it in and it goes, Linus's thought integrated into laptops?
[885.00 --> 886.00]  Question mark.
[886.00 --> 888.00]  He goes, you know what would be great?
[888.00 --> 889.00]  Integrated into laptops.
[889.00 --> 890.00]  You know what?
[890.00 --> 891.00]  Congratulations for your good idea.
[891.00 --> 892.00]  Thank you.
[892.00 --> 893.00]  You did good.
[893.00 --> 894.00]  You were insightful.
[894.00 --> 897.00]  I was actually thinking about that I want to talk about this topic next.
[897.00 --> 898.00]  Yes, sure we can do that.
[898.00 --> 901.00]  I was actually thinking we might get more into that on Afterparty.
[901.00 --> 903.00]  Well, okay, you know what?
[903.00 --> 904.00]  We can get more into it on Afterparty.
[904.00 --> 905.00]  Sure.
[905.00 --> 907.00]  Let's do it during the show, but maybe not quite next.
[907.00 --> 908.00]  Sure.
[908.00 --> 911.00]  So, yeah, integrated into laptops.
[911.00 --> 926.00]  Like right now, one of the big problems with phones that faster wireless connectivity could fix is that you're either running around for a cable and using the old, stupid, traditional folder-based file transfer technique, or you're using something that's inherently slow.
[926.00 --> 927.00]  Like you're backing up to Dropbox.
[927.00 --> 929.00]  Herb derp, I'm loading up an iPhone again.
[929.00 --> 941.00]  Well, excuse me, I mean AirDrop to all of my other Apple devices that I don't have, to all my friends who use Apple who actually don't, to my iPhone 4 that actually doesn't support AirDrop.
[941.00 --> 945.00]  Every time I'm like, oh yeah, I'll just use AirDrop for this.
[945.00 --> 946.00]  Nope.
[946.00 --> 947.00]  Nope.
[947.00 --> 948.00]  Not at all.
[948.00 --> 949.00]  Nope.
[949.00 --> 950.00]  Nope.
[950.00 --> 951.00]  So, yeah.
[951.00 --> 952.00]  I guess that's pretty much it.
[952.00 --> 954.00]  Let's talk Snapcash.
[954.00 --> 955.00]  This is interesting.
[955.00 --> 958.00]  I did not see this one coming.
[958.00 --> 960.00]  So, everyone knows what Snapchat is.
[960.00 --> 963.00]  You send picture messages to people, in theory they're deleted.
[963.00 --> 965.00]  Not so much.
[965.00 --> 966.00]  I had finger quotes.
[966.00 --> 967.00]  Yeah.
[967.00 --> 968.00]  I had finger quotes.
[968.00 --> 969.00]  I said in theory.
[969.00 --> 970.00]  I think that pretty much covers my head.
[970.00 --> 973.00]  So, in theory plus finger quotes means like totally not at all.
[973.00 --> 975.00]  We need a shirt that says that.
[975.00 --> 976.00]  Yeah.
[976.00 --> 981.00]  Totally not at all in quotes.
[981.00 --> 985.00]  So, Snapcash uses Square Cash.
[985.00 --> 990.00]  So, if you guys have heard of Square, I actually signed up for Square back when they first started up.
[990.00 --> 1001.00]  Basically, it was just a little dongle that plugged into your phone so that you could, so anyone could accept credit card transactions with a very reasonable interchange fee or additional charge on top of it.
[1001.00 --> 1007.00]  Actually, I've never seen that in Canada, but multiple places when I was going around Europe was using Square.
[1007.00 --> 1008.00]  It's pretty interesting.
[1008.00 --> 1013.00]  So, Square Cash is just more like more debit card-y.
[1013.00 --> 1016.00]  Okay, so Square, okay, well hold on, hold on, hold on.
[1016.00 --> 1022.00]  Square Cash on its own is you just key in your debit card and then it's more for like peer-to-peer transfers.
[1022.00 --> 1036.00]  So, you wouldn't expect to walk into a restaurant and have them accept Square Cash and you just kind of go, you know, bippity-boopity in my app and you send it to that person who then gets a notification that they have been sent money and they can accept it.
[1036.00 --> 1042.00]  So, that's more for like, you know, you're meeting with someone, you know, behind the alley to trade computer parts.
[1042.00 --> 1043.00]  In your games.
[1043.00 --> 1050.00]  I mean, I wouldn't use an electronic, if I was buying drugs I wouldn't use anything electronic.
[1050.00 --> 1052.00]  But, but if you're buying computer hardware it's all good.
[1052.00 --> 1053.00]  Can you not?
[1053.00 --> 1054.00]  It's Silk Road or weird.
[1054.00 --> 1055.00]  Whatever you're about to say, can you not?
[1055.00 --> 1056.00]  It's Silk Road.
[1056.00 --> 1057.00]  What?
[1057.00 --> 1058.00]  Silk Road.
[1058.00 --> 1060.00]  Okay, okay, I wouldn't use Square.
[1060.00 --> 1061.00]  I wouldn't use my debit card.
[1061.00 --> 1062.00]  Can we say that much?
[1062.00 --> 1063.00]  Sure.
[1063.00 --> 1067.00]  Okay, so Square stores your debit card information securely, they say.
[1067.00 --> 1071.00]  I don't, I haven't verified that, but they store it securely and then you can just use it.
[1071.00 --> 1075.00]  So, I've heard of people using it for things like tip splitting when they're out for dinner.
[1075.00 --> 1078.00]  It's like, hey, I don't have any cash.
[1078.00 --> 1081.00]  Someone's got a credit card, someone else squares them some money.
[1081.00 --> 1082.00]  Awesome.
[1082.00 --> 1083.00]  So.
[1083.00 --> 1086.00]  Okay, so all the credit card stuff is stored by Square or Snapchat?
[1086.00 --> 1087.00]  Not credit card yet.
[1087.00 --> 1088.00]  Debit.
[1088.00 --> 1090.00]  Okay, all that information is stored by Square or Snapchat?
[1090.00 --> 1098.00]  If you use Square Cash, Square, and I believe with Snapchat, it is going to be Snapchat, but don't quote me on that one either.
[1098.00 --> 1104.00]  There's not a ton of information about this yet, and honestly, this was posted by King Daddy Daniel on the forum, by the way.
[1104.00 --> 1107.00]  And I'll post the original article from TechCrunch right here.
[1107.00 --> 1114.00]  Honestly, the most information is in their hilarious video that has a bunch of dancers running around.
[1114.00 --> 1117.00]  You know what, it's probably worth us just firing up on the show here.
[1117.00 --> 1118.00]  Oh, jeez.
[1118.00 --> 1119.00]  Because it's pretty funny.
[1119.00 --> 1120.00]  What?
[1120.00 --> 1122.00]  It's very, very over the top.
[1122.00 --> 1124.00]  Let's just go ahead and screen share here.
[1124.00 --> 1125.00]  Okay.
[1125.00 --> 1126.00]  Oh, that's weird.
[1126.00 --> 1135.00]  Well, I guess we don't get any audio, but whatever.
[1135.00 --> 1138.00]  He says, buy this, can you send me some cash?
[1138.00 --> 1147.00]  So the way it works is instead of relying on a dedicated financial app, you just use Snapchat, you type in a dollar amount, and slow motion for dramatic, there you go.
[1147.00 --> 1154.00]  The button turns green, and you just send cash. Boom. Just like that. If the other person doesn't have it set up, then it'll prompt them to set it up.
[1154.00 --> 1155.00]  Oh my god.
[1155.00 --> 1167.00]  And, yeah. So this is the video, which is hilarious. It involves a lot more dancing. It goes on for way too long. It's over two minutes long.
[1167.00 --> 1171.00]  So this is going to be like the easiest way to steal money from friends.
[1171.00 --> 1172.00]  Wow.
[1172.00 --> 1174.00]  I see this end up being terrible.
[1174.00 --> 1177.00]  You always look at things from like this, like dark, dark-
[1177.00 --> 1178.00]  But you have to!
[1178.00 --> 1180.00]  What evil people will do with it, whereas I'm like-
[1180.00 --> 1181.00]  You have to!
[1181.00 --> 1186.00]  Oh, this is such a cool way to be like, you know, bro, here's ten bucks for the lunch you just got for me.
[1186.00 --> 1194.00]  Yeah, bro at a frat party, everyone passes out, bro walks around because he wasn't drinking and goes to everyone's phone and just Snapchats himself hundreds of dollars.
[1194.00 --> 1203.00]  Okay, so, okay, let's do benefits and drawbacks analysis. Okay, so easy to steal.
[1203.00 --> 1204.00]  Yeah, extremely.
[1204.00 --> 1212.00]  I would say benefit is if you do send someone out to buy something for you, you no longer need to give Buddy your PIN or your credit card.
[1212.00 --> 1213.00]  PayPal.
[1213.00 --> 1214.00]  Which is something that-
[1214.00 --> 1217.00]  Oh, come on. You're gonna use PayPal for that?
[1217.00 --> 1219.00]  Why not?
[1219.00 --> 1221.00]  Why would they have PayPal?
[1221.00 --> 1223.00]  Everyone has PayPal.
[1223.00 --> 1224.00]  Do they?
[1224.00 --> 1227.00]  I don't know anyone who doesn't have PayPal. My mom has it, my grandpa has it.
[1227.00 --> 1229.00]  I don't think I have a personal PayPal account.
[1229.00 --> 1230.00]  Really?
[1230.00 --> 1231.00]  Yeah.
[1231.00 --> 1232.00]  You're weird.
[1232.00 --> 1235.00]  I have a company PayPal account, my wife has a PayPal account, I do not have a PayPal account.
[1235.00 --> 1236.00]  What would I need it for?
[1236.00 --> 1237.00]  I don't know.
[1237.00 --> 1240.00]  I'm not gonna buy anything with PayPal, I get rewards on my credit card.
[1240.00 --> 1244.00]  And then merchants get to pay for it.
[1244.00 --> 1249.00]  That's right, Best Buy CEO man who hates interchange fees that earn rewards from me.
[1249.00 --> 1255.00]  Wouldn't withdrawing money from your card into PayPal still count as, so you'd still get rewards from your credit card?
[1255.00 --> 1257.00]  Mmm, can't remember.
[1257.00 --> 1258.00]  Can't remember, but that's a good point.
[1258.00 --> 1260.00]  I'm not sure actually, I have no idea.
[1260.00 --> 1261.00]  Anyway.
[1261.00 --> 1262.00]  Okay, the point is if this is much faster-
[1262.00 --> 1264.00]  It is much faster.
[1264.00 --> 1265.00]  There.
[1265.00 --> 1274.00]  Okay, so, and, and, and, you say PayPal, but I know that you've given me your debit card and told me your pin to go buy something for you.
[1274.00 --> 1275.00]  It's still easier than this.
[1275.00 --> 1279.00]  So, no, no, no, no, no, this looks legitimately pretty easy.
[1279.00 --> 1283.00]  Assume, okay, assume now that you're not 20-something and you're 18-something.
[1283.00 --> 1284.00]  No, but the reason why-
[1284.00 --> 1285.00]  And you actually have Snapchat.
[1285.00 --> 1291.00]  But the reason why this is not as easy as just giving you a debit card, I don't do that with everybody.
[1291.00 --> 1293.00]  Um, gosh.
[1293.00 --> 1298.00]  It's because, uh, you don't know what the price is gonna be.
[1298.00 --> 1305.00]  So what, like, the guy, like, gets to the store, rings through the whole transaction, and then calls you and is like, hey, it's this much, and then it's not that?
[1305.00 --> 1309.00]  No, but they could come back and be like, yo dawg, it was 1862, and you'd be boop-boop-boop-boop-boop.
[1309.00 --> 1310.00]  So you owe me that much?
[1310.00 --> 1311.00]  Yeah.
[1311.00 --> 1312.00]  I think it, I think it's awesome.
[1312.00 --> 1315.00]  I think the potential to exploit it is definitely there.
[1315.00 --> 1326.00]  I think that kids today need to learn to put pins on their phones, um, that their friends don't know, because the phone is more and more and more tied into so many things you can do.
[1326.00 --> 1327.00]  Everything.
[1327.00 --> 1332.00]  Even Apple's way of validating Apple Pay with Touch ID, I believe you can also enter a pin.
[1332.00 --> 1340.00]  So if someone knows the pin of your phone, all of a sudden they can buy things, which is a whole other ball of wax compared to they can, like, text your friends and be like,
[1340.00 --> 1342.00]  whoa, I'm ugly.
[1342.00 --> 1344.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1344.00 --> 1345.00]  Yeah, phone pranking is-
[1345.00 --> 1348.00]  Post on Facebook, I hacked your Facebook!
[1348.00 --> 1349.00]  Yeah.
[1349.00 --> 1350.00]  No.
[1350.00 --> 1351.00]  Not so much.
[1351.00 --> 1354.00]  Alright, so, court rules.
[1354.00 --> 1356.00]  This is posted by TechDreamer on the forum.
[1356.00 --> 1357.00]  Court rules!
[1357.00 --> 1358.00]  Yeah, court rules.
[1358.00 --> 1359.00]  Yeah.
[1359.00 --> 1360.00]  If I fought that, then I would be alone.
[1360.00 --> 1361.00]  Exactly.
[1361.00 --> 1362.00]  Me and lawyers.
[1362.00 --> 1370.00]  So this was from, this is from Engadget.com, and of course, I don't have an HTTP on that one.
[1370.00 --> 1371.00]  Boom!
[1371.00 --> 1372.00]  Engadget.com.
[1372.00 --> 1373.00]  There you go.
[1373.00 --> 1391.00]  Um, originally posted by TechDreamer, and, uh, US court had, in San Francisco has ruled that due to the First Amendment, so this is freedom of speech predominantly, Google can arrange and rearrange search results any way it wants.
[1391.00 --> 1407.00]  So this is, um, this is from a complaint from a, they figured they were a competitor of one of Google's services that Google was intentionally downranking them in Google search results in order to drive more exposure to their own services.
[1407.00 --> 1417.00]  And basically, this ruling, it doesn't, it doesn't rule out Google being attacked for this in other regions or by other, by other companies.
[1417.00 --> 1418.00]  Yeah.
[1418.00 --> 1426.00]  But what it does do is it sets a precedent that Google can now point to and say, well, hey, it was already ruled that we're allowed to arrange our search results however we want, so...
[1427.00 --> 1428.00]  Yeah.
[1429.00 --> 1431.00]  That's how, like, referencing different court trials and works.
[1431.00 --> 1432.00]  Enjoy that.
[1432.00 --> 1434.00]  It'd be like, Google versus whoever.
[1434.00 --> 1437.00]  Um, I just, honestly, I...
[1437.00 --> 1438.00]  They were already doing it anyway.
[1438.00 --> 1439.00]  Yeah.
[1439.00 --> 1442.00]  Even, whether it was legal or not, they were already doing it, and they were gonna do it forever.
[1442.00 --> 1447.00]  I mean, it is, it is no great secret that when Google, like, it's not a good idea.
[1447.00 --> 1454.00]  That when Google launches some new service that everyone hates, like Google Plus, that all of a sudden it's everywhere.
[1454.00 --> 1455.00]  Yeah.
[1455.00 --> 1456.00]  Duh.
[1456.00 --> 1457.00]  I don't know.
[1457.00 --> 1459.00]  I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[1459.00 --> 1464.00]  Um, I think it sounds a little bit scary, but I don't think it's actually going to be.
[1464.00 --> 1468.00]  They can't abuse it any worse than they already are, really.
[1468.00 --> 1469.00]  Yeah.
[1469.00 --> 1471.00]  Because if they do, people will stop Googling things.
[1471.00 --> 1475.00]  When Bing, the second, there's no loyalty to a search engine.
[1475.00 --> 1477.00]  In particular, the search engine.
[1477.00 --> 1481.00]  Things like their, their applications, like their calendar or their email.
[1481.00 --> 1491.00]  There's, there's some loyalty there because they've managed to drive us as a business to give them a monthly payment in order to use these services because of how well integrated they are.
[1491.00 --> 1498.00]  But for, especially something like using a search engine, which is what this complaint is about, there is no loyalty.
[1498.00 --> 1503.00]  If Bing starts returning better search results for me, I will switch tomorrow.
[1503.00 --> 1504.00]  I'd love to use Bing.
[1504.00 --> 1505.00]  It's just useless.
[1505.00 --> 1512.00]  I switched from AltaVista to Google that quickly because AltaVista stopped working and Google started doing better.
[1512.00 --> 1514.00]  Same thing with dog pile.
[1514.00 --> 1521.00]  Like, those of you who are, who've been using the internet long enough to remember the pre-Google days, there are other search engines.
[1521.00 --> 1523.00]  It's just that they suck.
[1523.00 --> 1530.00]  So if Google degrades the quality of their results by prioritizing their own crap aggressively enough, we'll just stop using it.
[1530.00 --> 1532.00]  And they'll lose their primary source of income.
[1532.00 --> 1533.00]  So it's not going to happen.
[1533.00 --> 1536.00]  I know ask.com is still a thing, but like, not really.
[1536.00 --> 1538.00]  And I remember Ask Jeeves being huge.
[1538.00 --> 1540.00]  Yeah, Ask Jeeves was huge.
[1540.00 --> 1541.00]  Yeah.
[1541.00 --> 1546.00]  I think I went, uh, AltaVista, Ask Jeeves, Google, actually, I think was, was what I used.
[1546.00 --> 1548.00]  AltaVista used to be awesome.
[1548.00 --> 1550.00]  You could find everything there.
[1550.00 --> 1552.00]  And then it just went to complete garbage.
[1552.00 --> 1555.00]  You know, it is, it is amazing how bad Bing is.
[1555.00 --> 1556.00]  I know.
[1556.00 --> 1560.00]  Every time I install a new Windows OS, I think I've told this story before.
[1560.00 --> 1567.00]  Every time I install a new Windows OS, I have to use IE until I'm not lazy and I install some other browser.
[1567.00 --> 1573.00]  So I'll use IE and the default search engine will be Bing because I'm not going to go through all those other steps to manually change my search engine.
[1573.00 --> 1576.00]  And then it's kind of a pain to add it, so I'm lazy.
[1576.00 --> 1579.00]  Um, and I will use Bing until it infuriates me.
[1579.00 --> 1582.00]  And it's usually gone within three searches.
[1582.00 --> 1584.00]  Because it doesn't find anything useful.
[1584.00 --> 1585.00]  It doesn't find it, yeah.
[1585.00 --> 1586.00]  I don't know.
[1586.00 --> 1592.00]  And like, you search the exact name of a product and it will find you everything else it possibly can.
[1592.00 --> 1593.00]  Yeah.
[1593.00 --> 1596.00]  And then you put that name in Google and the first result is the product page from that company.
[1596.00 --> 1597.00]  From the manufacturer.
[1597.00 --> 1598.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1598.00 --> 1599.00]  It's like, what am I looking for?
[1599.00 --> 1605.00]  Like some obscure reference to like, it's coming out in six months from some message board from six months ago.
[1605.00 --> 1607.00]  No, I want to look at it.
[1607.00 --> 1608.00]  Um, New York.
[1608.00 --> 1609.00]  This is the coolest thing ever.
[1609.00 --> 1610.00]  What?
[1610.00 --> 1611.00]  Oh, yes.
[1611.00 --> 1612.00]  This is awesome.
[1612.00 --> 1613.00]  New York City to replace public.
[1613.00 --> 1616.00]  This was posted by the Uncon, whatever, something.
[1616.00 --> 1619.00]  Um, so the original articles are from absolutely everywhere.
[1619.00 --> 1622.00]  Uh, so the Verge has got an article about this.
[1622.00 --> 1623.00]  The Unconnected.
[1623.00 --> 1626.00]  Uh, TechCrunch, Ars Technica, Business Insider.
[1626.00 --> 1631.00]  I'll post the Verge one here because I'm apparently, because that's the one I copied.
[1631.00 --> 1634.00]  Although I'm still mad at them about that really stupid piece they did on Gamergate.
[1634.00 --> 1635.00]  Yeah.
[1635.00 --> 1636.00]  Um.
[1636.00 --> 1637.00]  It was really stupid, but like, basically.
[1637.00 --> 1639.00]  It was really stupid.
[1639.00 --> 1641.00]  But like, basically everyone else has released stuff like that too.
[1641.00 --> 1643.00]  That has talked about it.
[1643.00 --> 1644.00]  That's true.
[1644.00 --> 1646.00]  Everyone was stupid.
[1646.00 --> 1647.00]  Yes.
[1647.00 --> 1650.00]  But the Verges was like, late to the party and stupid.
[1650.00 --> 1651.00]  That's true.
[1651.00 --> 1657.00]  So they didn't have the advantage of not having everyone else's stupidity to look at and not follow them off the cliff like a lemming.
[1657.00 --> 1658.00]  So, there you go.
[1658.00 --> 1659.00]  Yep.
[1659.00 --> 1664.00]  This is going to be called LinkNYC and they will be replacing 10,000 payphones.
[1664.00 --> 1666.00]  I mean, who uses payphones?
[1666.00 --> 1674.00]  With pylons, towers, posts, capable of providing free public wifi at gigabit speeds 24-7.
[1674.00 --> 1677.00]  There's also a charging station for your mobile devices.
[1677.00 --> 1679.00]  You can call any number domestically in the US.
[1679.00 --> 1685.00]  And it features a tablet-like interface that can service, that can provide services like directions.
[1685.00 --> 1686.00]  That's awesome.
[1686.00 --> 1688.00]  Not paid for with taxpayer money.
[1688.00 --> 1693.00]  Instead, it is advertiser driven and the residential version will not have ads.
[1693.00 --> 1698.00]  The project is estimated to bring $500 million of revenue into New York City in its first 12 years.
[1698.00 --> 1700.00]  And what a boon for the residents.
[1700.00 --> 1701.00]  Brilliant.
[1701.00 --> 1704.00]  New York City planners, you guys are awesome.
[1704.00 --> 1705.00]  Your kids are awesome.
[1705.00 --> 1707.00]  Your dogs are awesome.
[1707.00 --> 1709.00]  And especially your ideas are awesome.
[1709.00 --> 1710.00]  Mainly your dogs are awesome.
[1710.00 --> 1711.00]  They wear rocket packs.
[1711.00 --> 1713.00]  And they're super stoked when you come home.
[1713.00 --> 1715.00]  That's how forward thinking they are.
[1715.00 --> 1716.00]  Yeah.
[1716.00 --> 1722.00]  Anyways, when you first said ads, I was working before the show so I didn't have a lot of time to...
[1722.00 --> 1724.00]  Well, they're like big billboards on the pylons.
[1724.00 --> 1725.00]  Yeah, like that's cool.
[1725.00 --> 1726.00]  Like a bus stop.
[1726.00 --> 1727.00]  I was like, oh, you're gonna inject ads in my browser all the time?
[1727.00 --> 1728.00]  It's gonna suck.
[1728.00 --> 1730.00]  Especially on mobile when you can't see anything already.
[1730.00 --> 1731.00]  Right.
[1731.00 --> 1732.00]  If it's on the side of the thing.
[1732.00 --> 1733.00]  Like, it's New York City.
[1733.00 --> 1734.00]  Stuff everywhere anyway.
[1734.00 --> 1735.00]  Yeah.
[1735.00 --> 1737.00]  If there was some tall written stuff.
[1738.00 --> 1739.00]  I don't know if it's gonna really change much.
[1739.00 --> 1743.00]  It's not confirmed whether seamless hopping from pylon to pylon will be supported.
[1743.00 --> 1747.00]  So, you may have to treat it kind of like a phone booth.
[1747.00 --> 1752.00]  You know, where you actually kind of have to stand next to it to make a call and then kind of boogie on to the next place.
[1752.00 --> 1753.00]  I doubt it.
[1753.00 --> 1754.00]  But...
[1754.00 --> 1762.00]  And one concern that I have is if you're set up, and depending on the way the pylon works, like, even if you don't seamlessly roam, if you do...
[1762.00 --> 1767.00]  If you do connection hop at all, every mobile OS...
[1767.00 --> 1768.00]  Actually, I haven't tried Blackberry.
[1768.00 --> 1769.00]  You have.
[1769.00 --> 1770.00]  So maybe you can correct me on this.
[1770.00 --> 1771.00]  It's been a long time.
[1771.00 --> 1772.00]  Um, every...
[1772.00 --> 1779.00]  iOS and Android, both of them handle degraded Wi-Fi connections extremely poorly.
[1779.00 --> 1783.00]  And they don't switch over to mobile data nearly gracefully enough.
[1783.00 --> 1786.00]  Windows Phone does it incredibly well.
[1786.00 --> 1787.00]  It goes, oh, crap.
[1787.00 --> 1788.00]  This is bad.
[1788.00 --> 1793.00]  And switches over to your mobile data connection so you hardly even notice when you're browsing.
[1793.00 --> 1797.00]  But that's a big issue when you're at the fringes of a Wi-Fi coverage zone.
[1797.00 --> 1810.00]  So, if you were walking down the street doing something on your phone, then if you reach edges of these pylons all the time and you're automatically jumping on them, it could be very, very disruptive.
[1810.00 --> 1813.00]  So, that's just my one thought on it.
[1813.00 --> 1814.00]  Yeah.
[1814.00 --> 1817.00]  Other than that, it's amazing in every way.
[1817.00 --> 1819.00]  Have you used ShotGo Wi-Fi?
[1819.00 --> 1820.00]  Yeah, I have.
[1820.00 --> 1821.00]  It's surprisingly good.
[1821.00 --> 1822.00]  Yep.
[1822.00 --> 1824.00]  And I wouldn't be surprised if it worked something like that.
[1824.00 --> 1832.00]  Yeah, so the way that works is the internet provider that I'm on, just by being a customer, they have Wi-Fi hotspots in all kinds of places.
[1832.00 --> 1835.00]  Like, they're all named the same thing and they're all open.
[1835.00 --> 1838.00]  So, you automatically connect and then there's like a web sign in thing.
[1838.00 --> 1839.00]  Yeah.
[1839.00 --> 1841.00]  But it's really good at remembering your account.
[1841.00 --> 1842.00]  Like, really, really good.
[1842.00 --> 1847.00]  So, every single time that it detects this open network, your phone will connect to it and it signs in immediately and it's all fine.
[1847.00 --> 1848.00]  Yeah, it's super cool.
[1848.00 --> 1852.00]  Like, even my, I don't know, what are they called?
[1852.00 --> 1853.00]  Baby doctor.
[1853.00 --> 1854.00]  Uh...
[1854.00 --> 1855.00]  Whatever.
[1855.00 --> 1858.00]  The family doctor for my wife's pregnancies.
[1858.00 --> 1861.00]  Like, their waiting room has a shot open hotspots.
[1861.00 --> 1862.00]  It's like, awesome, yay!
[1862.00 --> 1863.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1863.00 --> 1865.00]  I guess I won't be using my mobile data right now.
[1865.00 --> 1866.00]  Right.
[1866.00 --> 1867.00]  Okay.
[1867.00 --> 1873.00]  Uh, Dell's UP2715K 5K monitor.
[1873.00 --> 1877.00]  This was rumored to be coming in at $2,500.
[1877.00 --> 1880.00]  Uh, this was posted on the forum by Big Strooms, by the way.
[1880.00 --> 1883.00]  And the original article is from guru3d.com.
[1883.00 --> 1889.00]  But, uh, I think Apple might have forced Dell's hand a little bit here.
[1889.00 --> 1902.00]  I think Dell was really hoping to have, you know, um, to resurrect the expensive monitor business that has basically disappeared since 30 inch, 2560 by 1600 monitors.
[1902.00 --> 1907.00]  Well, those never came down in price, but the 2560 by 1440 27 inch varieties did.
[1907.00 --> 1908.00]  Oh, yeah.
[1908.00 --> 1911.00]  And ever since that business kind of went away, it looks like they were trying to resurrect this.
[1911.00 --> 1923.00]  They wanted $2,500 for a monitor and then Apple turned around and bitch slapped them by giving you a fairly decent computer attached to that same panel in a beautiful enclosure for $3,500.
[1923.00 --> 1926.00]  So, no brainer.
[1926.00 --> 1927.00]  Go for the...
[1927.00 --> 1930.00]  And you could use that computer as a monitor, right?
[1930.00 --> 1931.00]  No.
[1931.00 --> 1932.00]  Really?
[1932.00 --> 1933.00]  The iMac?
[1933.00 --> 1934.00]  There's no functionality for that at all?
[1934.00 --> 1935.00]  No.
[1935.00 --> 1936.00]  Um, older iMacs, yes.
[1936.00 --> 1940.00]  They had some feature, I forget what it's called, who cares, it's an Apple feature.
[1940.00 --> 1943.00]  Um, but like, I wish they just had a display input.
[1943.00 --> 1949.00]  But this one uses, um, so, and actually Dell's implementation is very different from Apple's, I'll talk about that in a moment.
[1949.00 --> 1955.00]  But the Apple one uses a custom wider, like it's physically wider and has more pins.
[1955.00 --> 1958.00]  It is a non-standard DisplayPort connector.
[1958.00 --> 1959.00]  Interesting.
[1959.00 --> 1962.00]  That they worked with AMD on, presumably.
[1962.00 --> 1967.00]  Uh, that they, in order to drive that panel as a single tile display.
[1967.00 --> 1970.00]  So what that means is, there is no input.
[1970.00 --> 1971.00]  Right.
[1971.00 --> 1972.00]  That could drive it.
[1972.00 --> 1973.00]  Yeah.
[1973.00 --> 1974.00]  Alright then.
[1974.00 --> 1975.00]  Yeah, so I get it.
[1975.00 --> 1976.00]  Yeah.
[1976.00 --> 1980.00]  And I understand that it is better to have a single tile display, so you don't see that weird tearing.
[1980.00 --> 1982.00]  We have one dual tile display in the office.
[1982.00 --> 1983.00]  Not really fair.
[1983.00 --> 1984.00]  And it's not an ideal solution.
[1984.00 --> 1988.00]  Um, but Dell's is going to be a dual tile display.
[1988.00 --> 1992.00]  So it'll use two DisplayPort inputs, because DisplayPort 1.3 isn't here yet.
[1992.00 --> 1997.00]  And it'll have, um, okay here, I guess I might as well just do a general spec.
[1997.00 --> 1999.00]  I don't know if I would move up yet then.
[1999.00 --> 2005.00]  A 5120 by 2880 resolution with 8 millisecond gray to gray response times, a thousand to one contrast ratio,
[2005.00 --> 2011.00]  350, uh, hold on, oh, 178, 178 viewing angles.
[2011.00 --> 2015.00]  So basically, basically anywhere you would ever be looking at the screen.
[2015.00 --> 2019.00]  It's got a double anti-reflective coating to allow more light to pass through the glass in the panel.
[2019.00 --> 2022.00]  Features an anti-smudge coating to help wipe away fingerprints.
[2022.00 --> 2026.00]  Uh, 99% RGB, 100% sRGB color space.
[2026.00 --> 2030.00]  And calibrated with a color, Delta-color, Delta-E of less than two.
[2030.00 --> 2032.00]  12-bit internal processing.
[2032.00 --> 2035.00]  So it's a 12-bit lookup table and the panel is 10-bit.
[2035.00 --> 2040.00]  So it would be potentially useful for folks who use Adobe applications on Quadro,
[2040.00 --> 2044.00]  or, um, Crap Fire Pro cards.
[2044.00 --> 2047.00]  Um, and they want to work in 10-bit color.
[2047.00 --> 2050.00]  Although the workflow is still fairly broken.
[2050.00 --> 2052.00]  And, yeah.
[2052.00 --> 2055.00]  So, yeah.
[2055.00 --> 2060.00]  I guess there's not really much else to say about it other than I don't think it makes a ton of sense.
[2060.00 --> 2062.00]  I was gonna say, I don't, I don't personally think it's ready.
[2062.00 --> 2064.00]  I don't know if I would jump yet.
[2064.00 --> 2066.00]  If I wanted a 5k monitor, I don't think this would be it.
[2066.00 --> 2072.00]  If Windows, uh, is able to start scaling better.
[2072.00 --> 2073.00]  That's a big problem.
[2073.00 --> 2082.00]  Then this would be, actually, I would see this as the way to go for productivity applications versus media consumption.
[2082.00 --> 2086.00]  Because it is exactly four times 2560 by 1440.
[2086.00 --> 2088.00]  So the scaling could be relatively simple.
[2088.00 --> 2098.00]  That's one of the reasons that it speculated that Apple went with 5k as opposed to 4k or Ultra HD, excuse me, for the iMac retina.
[2098.00 --> 2103.00]  Um, cause really you didn't need to go 5k on that to make it retina.
[2103.00 --> 2104.00]  Like it's overkill.
[2104.00 --> 2106.00]  It's insanely sharp.
[2106.00 --> 2107.00]  Yeah.
[2107.00 --> 2115.00]  Um, but, the flip side of that argument is that 5k is not going to be as good for content consumption.
[2115.00 --> 2118.00]  Because you are going to get interpolation.
[2118.00 --> 2122.00]  Because you're gonna be running any movie content at a non-native res.
[2122.00 --> 2125.00]  And there will be no 5k content anytime soon.
[2125.00 --> 2133.00]  So upscaling from 1080p to 4k has that advantage of being exactly four times, excuse me, two times the resolution, four times the pixel count.
[2133.00 --> 2139.00]  Um, and then scaling to 5k is just sort of a random arbitrary amount more than that.
[2139.00 --> 2143.00]  So, there you go.
[2143.00 --> 2149.00]  I see 5k as the creator resolution and I see 4k as the consumer resolution.
[2149.00 --> 2156.00]  But we're a long way away from either of them really being practical in Windows because of the way that UI elements scale so poorly.
[2156.00 --> 2158.00]  So, so, so poorly.
[2158.00 --> 2160.00]  Not good at all.
[2160.00 --> 2168.00]  And that was kind of, uh, almost like sad seeing you work on your Mac knowing that it's 5k and like it's fine.
[2168.00 --> 2169.00]  Yeah, I know right?
[2169.00 --> 2170.00]  Come on Windows.
[2170.00 --> 2171.00]  It looks great.
[2171.00 --> 2172.00]  It does.
[2172.00 --> 2173.00]  I'm like, damn it.
[2173.00 --> 2176.00]  Like every single time we hook up a 4k monitor to a computer, I'm like, this is unusable.
[2176.00 --> 2177.00]  Like it looks so stupid.
[2177.00 --> 2181.00]  And then you turn on the scaling and it's like, now just some things are unusual.
[2181.00 --> 2182.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[2182.00 --> 2185.00]  It's like, this is still super stupid.
[2185.00 --> 2186.00]  What are you doing?
[2186.00 --> 2188.00]  Oh, it's really frustrating.
[2188.00 --> 2197.00]  Oh, we've got Scopeopex on Twitch chat saying letterbox equals no weird interpolation.
[2197.00 --> 2203.00]  Come on man, you're gonna buy a 5k monitor and then you're gonna run black bars on all sides of your content.
[2203.00 --> 2205.00]  Are you kidding me?
[2205.00 --> 2207.00]  That's even worse.
[2207.00 --> 2216.00]  I would rather, I would rather have approximations than gigantic black bars all across, all around the content.
[2216.00 --> 2222.00]  Speaking of black bars all around the content, this was originally posted by Sephiroth on the forum.
[2222.00 --> 2226.00]  Origin PC to sell, copy the link URL, sorry I'm just copying the link for you guys.
[2226.00 --> 2228.00]  I'm trying to make a better habit of this.
[2228.00 --> 2229.00]  Black bars.
[2229.00 --> 2230.00]  Better job of doing this.
[2230.00 --> 2235.00]  They're gonna be selling their Millennium and Genesis cases stand alone.
[2235.00 --> 2238.00]  This is something that I, I, okay.
[2238.00 --> 2239.00]  We asked for, actually.
[2239.00 --> 2241.00]  Yeah, lots of people asked for it.
[2241.00 --> 2242.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[2242.00 --> 2243.00]  Cause it's a cool case.
[2243.00 --> 2244.00]  So check this out guys.
[2244.00 --> 2250.00]  Have you ever called up a boutique PC builder and asked them to buy their case?
[2250.00 --> 2253.00]  No, because I have never called up a boutique PC builder.
[2253.00 --> 2254.00]  Okay.
[2254.00 --> 2255.00]  I did it once.
[2255.00 --> 2259.00]  When, um, here I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna fire it up here.
[2259.00 --> 2262.00]  Alienware, Star Wars.
[2262.00 --> 2263.00]  Uh, that's not the one I wanted.
[2263.00 --> 2267.00]  The drive cages on these cases are badass by the way.
[2267.00 --> 2268.00]  There we go.
[2268.00 --> 2271.00]  This is, this is the one.
[2271.00 --> 2275.00]  I called Alienware and asked them if I could buy one.
[2275.00 --> 2276.00]  I understand.
[2276.00 --> 2284.00]  That was back when Alienware's case was actually a reasonably quote unquote cool design.
[2284.00 --> 2289.00]  I was younger and vinyl wraps were not nearly as common or as accessible.
[2289.00 --> 2295.00]  And I thought this was a stunning piece of Star Wars artwork that I would happily put my computer inside.
[2295.00 --> 2301.00]  Even though I had a better actual case, like a better designed, better laid out case at the time.
[2301.00 --> 2304.00]  I thought that limited edition one was worth it.
[2304.00 --> 2309.00]  And I know a lot of people asked for Voodoo PC to sell their modified Li and Li case standalone.
[2309.00 --> 2313.00]  It was a very beautiful case, but, uh, Origins is, is really cool as well.
[2313.00 --> 2319.00]  So the neatest thing about them is that, and this is part of their five year anniversary celebration.
[2319.00 --> 2323.00]  The neatest thing about them is that you can mount your motherboard in whatever orientation you want.
[2323.00 --> 2325.00]  So we'll go ahead and fire up their video here.
[2325.00 --> 2331.00]  This is such a slick video.
[2331.00 --> 2336.00]  They're just showing off.
[2336.00 --> 2337.00]  Yep.
[2337.00 --> 2351.00]  So right side up, upside down, facing up, either which way, whatever you prefer.
[2351.00 --> 2354.00]  And then their, their drive, drive mounting system is absolutely-
[2354.00 --> 2355.00]  Their drive cages are sick.
[2355.00 --> 2356.00]  Sick.
[2356.00 --> 2360.00]  Um, they've got a, they've got an add on thing that you can put underneath it.
[2360.00 --> 2362.00]  So you can add more drive cages or more rads.
[2362.00 --> 2363.00]  Yeah.
[2363.00 --> 2364.00]  Really cool case.
[2364.00 --> 2367.00]  And, uh, I don't know how much they're charging for it, but-
[2367.00 --> 2369.00]  $399 and $499.
[2369.00 --> 2370.00]  Not cheap.
[2370.00 --> 2372.00]  So if you want the, or wait, no, no, no.
[2372.00 --> 2373.00]  $399 and $449.
[2373.00 --> 2374.00]  There we go.
[2374.00 --> 2375.00]  Not cheap.
[2375.00 --> 2377.00]  Um, not out of the question either.
[2377.00 --> 2381.00]  I believe the $449 one, it says it's like the full tower or whatever.
[2381.00 --> 2384.00]  I think it's just the add on on the bottom and the same case on top.
[2384.00 --> 2385.00]  Yeah.
[2385.00 --> 2386.00]  I'm pretty sure.
[2386.00 --> 2387.00]  Yep.
[2387.00 --> 2388.00]  Um, but yeah, they're pretty sick.
[2388.00 --> 2390.00]  I got to see them at, what was that?
[2390.00 --> 2391.00]  E3, I think.
[2391.00 --> 2395.00]  I first saw one back at, um, CES.
[2395.00 --> 2396.00]  That was when they launched it.
[2396.00 --> 2397.00]  Yeah.
[2397.00 --> 2398.00]  Yeah.
[2398.00 --> 2399.00]  Nvidia had it in their booth.
[2399.00 --> 2400.00]  Yeah.
[2400.00 --> 2401.00]  And, uh, yeah, I thought it was pretty cool.
[2401.00 --> 2402.00]  They're cool.
[2402.00 --> 2403.00]  All right.
[2403.00 --> 2405.00]  So why don't we actually do our, why don't we do our sponsors?
[2405.00 --> 2406.00]  All right.
[2406.00 --> 2408.00]  In a timely manner for a change.
[2408.00 --> 2411.00]  Last few weeks, I've like completely forgotten about them.
[2411.00 --> 2412.00]  Well, it's $5.50.
[2412.00 --> 2414.00]  Let's cover our sponsors now.
[2414.00 --> 2415.00]  Yeah.
[2415.00 --> 2418.00]  I guess we should probably actually do that.
[2418.00 --> 2419.00]  Okay.
[2419.00 --> 2420.00]  Thank you.
[2420.00 --> 2422.00]  Uh, so our first sponsor this week is Lynda.com.
[2422.00 --> 2426.00]  You can have as much fun as she does learning online.
[2426.00 --> 2433.00]  Lynda.com is a great way to pick up new skills, whether it's photography, video editing, coding
[2433.00 --> 2435.00]  is a really, really big one over at Lynda.com.
[2435.00 --> 2436.00]  Yep.
[2436.00 --> 2438.00]  Um, did I say video editing already?
[2438.00 --> 2439.00]  Well, you did now.
[2439.00 --> 2444.00]  Well, video editing is very close to my heart just because we've got now, are we up to three
[2444.00 --> 2449.00]  people here that have used Lynda.com and learned skills that they now use here daily?
[2449.00 --> 2451.00]  Taren, Taren, me and someone.
[2451.00 --> 2452.00]  I thought it was, uh, was it Burkle?
[2452.00 --> 2453.00]  Maybe.
[2453.00 --> 2454.00]  I think so.
[2454.00 --> 2455.00]  Okay.
[2455.00 --> 2456.00]  I'll have to find out about that.
[2456.00 --> 2458.00]  But anyway, Lynda.com really does teach you things.
[2458.00 --> 2459.00]  It's awesome.
[2459.00 --> 2465.00]  So, you sign up for courses, you get this curated content from industry experts, there's new
[2465.00 --> 2470.00]  content being added all the time, it's inexpensive, and you can learn completely at your own pace.
[2470.00 --> 2478.00]  So, if you kind of go, oh, well, I'm only gonna, you know, do like one video this week and maybe
[2478.00 --> 2483.00]  next week I'll blow it off entirely, but the week after that I'm gonna cram like crazy, then it's
[2483.00 --> 2484.00]  basically like, wow.
[2484.00 --> 2485.00]  Wow.
[2485.00 --> 2486.00]  It's a subscription-based service.
[2486.00 --> 2488.00]  Ultimately, what do they care how much you use it?
[2488.00 --> 2491.00]  Use it however much you want or not however much you want.
[2491.00 --> 2492.00]  And that's totally cool with Wanda.
[2492.00 --> 2494.00]  It's like wow, but you level up in real life.
[2494.00 --> 2495.00]  Yes.
[2495.00 --> 2499.00]  It's like wow, except nothing like wow.
[2499.00 --> 2501.00]  It's like wow in that you pay for it monthly.
[2501.00 --> 2503.00]  Everything else is not the same.
[2503.00 --> 2504.00]  Not even close.
[2504.00 --> 2505.00]  And it's at your computer.
[2505.00 --> 2506.00]  I guess there's that.
[2506.00 --> 2507.00]  Yeah.
[2507.00 --> 2508.00]  Or your phone.
[2508.00 --> 2511.00]  You could learn skills in wow that are transferable to real life.
[2511.00 --> 2512.00]  Communication skills.
[2512.00 --> 2513.00]  Yeah.
[2513.00 --> 2514.00]  Yelling at people.
[2514.00 --> 2516.00]  Yelling at people is not a skill.
[2516.00 --> 2517.00]  Well.
[2517.00 --> 2518.00]  You wanna be a drill sergeant?
[2518.00 --> 2519.00]  Yeah.
[2519.00 --> 2520.00]  You could be a raid leader, then go be a drill sergeant.
[2520.00 --> 2525.00]  Yeah, but to be a drill sergeant you'd have to, okay, so you'd have to have like a healthy,
[2525.00 --> 2528.00]  balanced diet of wow and going to the gym.
[2528.00 --> 2529.00]  Yes.
[2529.00 --> 2530.00]  Unlikely.
[2530.00 --> 2531.00]  But possible.
[2531.00 --> 2532.00]  Really?
[2532.00 --> 2533.00]  You're gonna be like that?
[2533.00 --> 2534.00]  You're gonna stereotype?
[2534.00 --> 2535.00]  I said but possible.
[2535.00 --> 2537.00]  Alright, so lynda.com slash wanshow for a free seven day trial.
[2537.00 --> 2540.00]  You can try it out if you like it, then try it out.
[2540.00 --> 2543.00]  And if you don't like it, then wait, if you like it, then try it out.
[2543.00 --> 2545.00]  No, if you like it, then you stay subscribed.
[2545.00 --> 2547.00]  And if you don't like it, then you don't have to.
[2547.00 --> 2549.00]  No, you definitely, you know how they go on like super long marches?
[2549.00 --> 2550.00]  Sure.
[2550.00 --> 2551.00]  Yes.
[2551.00 --> 2552.00]  Oh wow.
[2552.00 --> 2555.00]  You just treadmill under your computer desk.
[2555.00 --> 2558.00]  So you're on like a permanent march while playing wow.
[2558.00 --> 2562.00]  So if you wanted to be a drill sergeant, you could be that dude that like runs in front of everyone and is like,
[2562.00 --> 2564.00]  look at me, I'm faster than all of you.
[2564.00 --> 2565.00]  Okay.
[2565.00 --> 2566.00]  I'm crazy endurance.
[2566.00 --> 2575.00]  If you want to be a drill that makes you actually hike as far as you have to hike in that bloody game, by the time you got an epic mount, you'd be in great shape.
[2575.00 --> 2583.00]  If you mount up, you have to run like, so if you get a hundred percent speed mount, you would have to run a hundred percent faster than you normally would be moving.
[2583.00 --> 2587.00]  So if you get like a flying mount, you're just like full out sprinting.
[2587.00 --> 2589.00]  So no one would even want mounts anymore.
[2589.00 --> 2590.00]  The value would plummet.
[2590.00 --> 2594.00]  It would cause an economic crisis in the world of Warcraft.
[2594.00 --> 2600.00]  The walk button would be used so much more because I wouldn't want to go slowly.
[2600.00 --> 2603.00]  The whole game would come to a grinding halt.
[2603.00 --> 2613.00]  If you had like, if you had like a noclip hack and you were just sitting above the world, you'd just see like these entire towns of people walking like this.
[2613.00 --> 2614.00]  That's the middle of a fight.
[2614.00 --> 2618.00]  And it's like, I can't get away from this scorpion because I'm too tired.
[2618.00 --> 2619.00]  Don't stand in the fire.
[2619.00 --> 2621.00]  I'm too tired to move.
[2621.00 --> 2623.00]  I have to stand in the fire.
[2623.00 --> 2624.00]  Heal me.
[2624.00 --> 2625.00]  Heal me.
[2625.00 --> 2629.00]  I'm just gonna, I'm gonna stay right here in the middle of this area of effects spell.
[2629.00 --> 2630.00]  It'll be fine.
[2630.00 --> 2631.00]  Just deal with it.
[2631.00 --> 2633.00]  Um, okay.
[2633.00 --> 2635.00]  So on to our next sponsor.
[2635.00 --> 2637.00]  Someone should make that video game so it can fail.
[2637.00 --> 2638.00]  Ugh.
[2638.00 --> 2639.00]  Kickstarter it.
[2639.00 --> 2640.00]  Yeah.
[2640.00 --> 2641.00]  Yeah.
[2641.00 --> 2642.00]  Okay.
[2642.00 --> 2644.00]  So our next sponsor is 5-4 Club.
[2644.00 --> 2649.00]  And we are, this is more of a reminder than an announcement because we already announced
[2649.00 --> 2653.00]  this, but they are doing an epic giveaway.
[2653.00 --> 2663.00]  They are giving away retail price, $7,200 or more in clothing to one lucky winner.
[2663.00 --> 2668.00]  And something I didn't even think of that you mentioned offline last time is what a cool
[2668.00 --> 2670.00]  thing for a college student to win.
[2670.00 --> 2671.00]  Yeah.
[2671.00 --> 2677.00]  If you could like show up, it's like your first, first year and you have five years
[2677.00 --> 2679.00]  of 5-4 Club membership.
[2679.00 --> 2685.00]  So you can look like a boss every day on campus, always new threads and it doesn't cost you
[2685.00 --> 2686.00]  a dollar.
[2686.00 --> 2687.00]  What a freaking cool prize.
[2687.00 --> 2690.00]  Cause I know there's a lot of different ways for companies to handle prizes.
[2690.00 --> 2695.00]  Like they could do one month subscriptions for 60 people.
[2695.00 --> 2696.00]  Yeah.
[2696.00 --> 2699.00]  And there's some benefit to that cause you're, you know, getting, you're giving a little bit
[2699.00 --> 2704.00]  to a lot of people or you can put together like a super awesome prize pack, which is what
[2704.00 --> 2705.00]  they've done here.
[2705.00 --> 2709.00]  That'll basically give someone all the wardrobe they'll need realistically.
[2709.00 --> 2712.00]  I mean, if you're subscribed to 5-4 Club for five years.
[2712.00 --> 2713.00]  Okay.
[2713.00 --> 2717.00]  So the way, the way it works is you pay 60 bucks a month and they send you a retail value
[2717.00 --> 2724.00]  on their site of $120 or more of clothing that your personal style assistant picks out for
[2724.00 --> 2725.00]  you and then ships to you.
[2725.00 --> 2731.00]  So that is, that is realistically kind of a couple shirts and like a bottom or sometimes
[2731.00 --> 2737.00]  shoes or whatever else once a month for five years, you're going to have so much clothing.
[2737.00 --> 2741.00]  Especially if you're in like the college range where you're probably, if you're not
[2741.00 --> 2743.00]  done growing, you're getting close to it.
[2743.00 --> 2749.00]  So guys, you head over to the bit.ly right here, bit.ly slash FFC giveaway.
[2749.00 --> 2752.00]  And once you enter, you can share it on social media.
[2752.00 --> 2754.00]  Each friend you refer gets you three more entries.
[2754.00 --> 2757.00]  The winning, the entries close November 23rd.
[2757.00 --> 2759.00]  So that's in two days.
[2759.00 --> 2762.00]  And the winning draw takes place November 25th.
[2762.00 --> 2763.00]  I think it's a super cool thing.
[2763.00 --> 2767.00]  And don't worry guys, if you don't win, then you can still go through the, what was it?
[2767.00 --> 2768.00]  One minute.
[2768.00 --> 2770.00]  I can never remember how fast they say the survey is.
[2770.00 --> 2771.00]  It's really short.
[2771.00 --> 2772.00]  Really fast.
[2772.00 --> 2773.00]  Go through a survey.
[2773.00 --> 2774.00]  I think it's a minute.
[2774.00 --> 2776.00]  Give them your sizes, your style preferences, and you can get hooked up and look good without
[2776.00 --> 2780.00]  ever having to go to a store and feel like everyone is judging you whenever you try things
[2780.00 --> 2783.00]  on that aren't cool, which is what I do.
[2783.00 --> 2786.00]  Yeah, this is what happens when we shop for ourselves.
[2786.00 --> 2788.00]  Five Four Club, don't look like us.
[2788.00 --> 2789.00]  Yeah.
[2789.00 --> 2790.00]  There you go.
[2790.00 --> 2791.00]  Problem solved.
[2791.00 --> 2792.00]  Oh, geez.
[2792.00 --> 2793.00]  Okay.
[2793.00 --> 2796.00]  So shall we tackle, shall we tackle that big topic now?
[2796.00 --> 2797.00]  Which big topic?
[2797.00 --> 2798.00]  The like, our big topic?
[2798.00 --> 2799.00]  Our big topic.
[2799.00 --> 2800.00]  Okay, sure.
[2800.00 --> 2801.00]  Okay, let's talk about our big topic.
[2801.00 --> 2803.00]  I don't know how you want to do this, but you go to town.
[2803.00 --> 2807.00]  Okay, so we recently launched our crowdfunding campaign.
[2807.00 --> 2813.00]  We had talked about this on WAN Show before, how we're going to be moving into a new office,
[2813.00 --> 2817.00]  and some people have been extremely receptive, and we've actually got over...
[2817.00 --> 2818.00]  Is that right?
[2818.00 --> 2819.00]  Uh...
[2819.00 --> 2821.00]  Since we started the show, it's gone up that much?
[2821.00 --> 2824.00]  Well, remember, it's being manually updated.
[2824.00 --> 2825.00]  Right.
[2825.00 --> 2826.00]  Okay, so it might even be more than that.
[2826.00 --> 2827.00]  And that's the Canadian value.
[2827.00 --> 2828.00]  Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[2828.00 --> 2829.00]  I know.
[2829.00 --> 2830.00]  Yeah.
[2830.00 --> 2831.00]  Okay, well...
[2831.00 --> 2832.00]  So it'll be a little bit more than that.
[2832.00 --> 2833.00]  Some of you have been awesome.
[2833.00 --> 2835.00]  You've been incredibly supportive.
[2835.00 --> 2836.00]  Um...
[2836.00 --> 2840.00]  Whether you've actually contributed to the campaign or not, you've been supportive of the idea.
[2840.00 --> 2841.00]  Um...
[2841.00 --> 2843.00]  Some of you have raised some objections to it.
[2843.00 --> 2845.00]  Raised some concerns.
[2845.00 --> 2846.00]  Voiced some concerns.
[2846.00 --> 2847.00]  Something some objections.
[2847.00 --> 2848.00]  There have been objections.
[2848.00 --> 2853.00]  So what I said on Twitter, uh, this morning, was that I would try to address what I thought
[2853.00 --> 2857.00]  were the most common objections here on WAN Show today.
[2857.00 --> 2861.00]  And then what we'll do is I'll commit to do a short after party with you guys where we'll
[2861.00 --> 2866.00]  do some, uh, some Twitter and Twitch interactions so you guys can let me know if there's anything
[2866.00 --> 2867.00]  that you're still concerned about.
[2867.00 --> 2869.00]  So, question number one.
[2869.00 --> 2872.00]  Why don't you guys have lower contribution tiers, like a dollar?
[2872.00 --> 2875.00]  The answer is, right now, everything is going through PayPal.
[2875.00 --> 2881.00]  And for very small transactions, their proportion of the payment is actually much higher, especially
[2881.00 --> 2883.00]  for something as small as a dollar.
[2883.00 --> 2887.00]  So rather than encouraging the members of our community who can least afford it, the
[2887.00 --> 2892.00]  people who can only afford to give a dollar, to basically give money to PayPal, I would
[2892.00 --> 2896.00]  just assume you guys keep it and support us in some other way by like, say for example,
[2896.00 --> 2897.00]  watching videos.
[2897.00 --> 2898.00]  You don't have to give us money.
[2898.00 --> 2899.00]  Or...
[2899.00 --> 2902.00]  Yeah, watching videos, describing, liking, disliking, posting on the forum, having a forum
[2902.00 --> 2903.00]  account.
[2903.00 --> 2908.00]  All of that is more helpful than padding PayPal's pockets as far as I'm concerned.
[2908.00 --> 2909.00]  Yeah.
[2909.00 --> 2910.00]  Question number two.
[2910.00 --> 2911.00]  Your stretch targets are ridiculous.
[2911.00 --> 2912.00]  Why are they so high?
[2912.00 --> 2915.00]  The answer is, you're right, they were ridiculous.
[2915.00 --> 2918.00]  They were much higher than they should have been initially and a big part of the reason
[2918.00 --> 2922.00]  for that is we weren't really sure how much momentum the campaign would have.
[2922.00 --> 2927.00]  Like, we didn't know if it was going to be overwhelming outpouring of support or if it
[2927.00 --> 2929.00]  was going to completely go nowhere.
[2929.00 --> 2933.00]  We didn't want to trap ourselves by putting ourselves in a situation where all of a sudden,
[2933.00 --> 2939.00]  we've got to hit every stretch, stretch target commitment in like a week or something like
[2939.00 --> 2940.00]  that.
[2940.00 --> 2946.00]  So now that we can see how things are tracking, we have completely rearranged the stretch targets
[2946.00 --> 2949.00]  to make them much more realistic and much more attainable.
[2949.00 --> 2952.00]  In fact, the first one has already been achieved.
[2952.00 --> 2956.00]  We have finally fixed Luke's Twitter handle on the WAN show.
[2956.00 --> 2957.00]  Yes.
[2957.00 --> 2961.00]  And it's possible that the second one has actually been achieved already.
[2961.00 --> 2963.00]  It's possible that more have been achieved.
[2963.00 --> 2964.00]  There's a slight problem.
[2964.00 --> 2965.00]  Thank you.
[2965.00 --> 2967.00]  Sorry, I have to interject here for a little bit.
[2967.00 --> 2968.00]  Thank you, Mr. Wizard.
[2968.00 --> 2971.00]  There's like no way that anything would be even remotely running right now if it wasn't
[2971.00 --> 2972.00]  for Mr. Wizard.
[2972.00 --> 2974.00]  Like not even close.
[2974.00 --> 2976.00]  So I just want to put that out there.
[2976.00 --> 2978.00]  Thanks, Mr. Wizard.
[2978.00 --> 2979.00]  And the problem is-
[2979.00 --> 2981.00]  We should call him Lord Wizard from now on.
[2981.00 --> 2982.00]  Lord Wizard.
[2982.00 --> 2984.00]  Or the Wizard.
[2984.00 --> 2990.00]  The problem is the call that we're making to get the amount raised, dollar value, doesn't
[2990.00 --> 2993.00]  take into account money that is pending.
[2993.00 --> 2994.00]  Okay.
[2994.00 --> 2997.00]  So we can't get the actual value so we're currently hard coding that.
[2997.00 --> 3000.00]  Just so you guys know, like overnight or something, if it doesn't move for a really long
[3000.00 --> 3004.00]  time, it's not because we're not counting your donations.
[3004.00 --> 3007.00]  It's because you've got to sleep for a little bit, wake up, and then we'll manually update
[3007.00 --> 3008.00]  it.
[3008.00 --> 3009.00]  All right.
[3009.00 --> 3010.00]  Question number three.
[3010.00 --> 3011.00]  Aren't you guys a business?
[3011.00 --> 3013.00]  Why aren't you seeking investment or taking out a loan?
[3013.00 --> 3017.00]  The answer is because some of you want to help us- no, that's the wrong answer.
[3017.00 --> 3021.00]  Yes, we are business, but those of you savvy enough to figure out these types of business
[3021.00 --> 3025.00]  strategies should also be savvy enough to know that moving into a much larger space is
[3025.00 --> 3030.00]  going to cost a lot more than $50,000, our goal for the campaign, even in the short term.
[3030.00 --> 3034.00]  So we're exploring every avenue necessary to grow and keep delivering the best content that
[3034.00 --> 3037.00]  we can, regardless of how much we raise during this campaign.
[3037.00 --> 3041.00]  And then the question number four then is, so then why are you asking for money at all?
[3041.00 --> 3044.00]  And the answer is because some of you want to help us in this way.
[3044.00 --> 3049.00]  We've done campaigns like this before with similar rewards, things like badges on the
[3049.00 --> 3053.00]  forum, and people have said that they're happy to be able to contribute in this way.
[3053.00 --> 3058.00]  In fact, a lot of people don't like the recurring contributor system that funds the forum and
[3058.00 --> 3061.00]  prefer something that's a one-shot deal.
[3061.00 --> 3066.00]  The last time we did this was over a year ago, so it's not like we're turning around and running
[3066.00 --> 3069.00]  a new crowdfunding campaign every other month or anything like that.
[3069.00 --> 3072.00]  It's something that we have been asked for.
[3072.00 --> 3077.00]  So for those people who do want to help us out like this, then we want to send our gratitude.
[3077.00 --> 3083.00]  And to everyone else, I mean, we're still grateful because every contribution, even one view on a video, counts.
[3083.00 --> 3086.00]  The thing to realize here is this is all optional.
[3086.00 --> 3088.00]  We're not holding our content hostage.
[3088.00 --> 3094.00]  We're not saying we're going to stop making tech videos if we don't hit this goal.
[3094.00 --> 3096.00]  Nothing happens if we don't hit the goal.
[3096.00 --> 3102.00]  It's just if you guys want to contribute, if you want to see some of the cool stretch targets, then go ahead and contribute to the campaign.
[3102.00 --> 3103.00]  Or don't.
[3103.00 --> 3104.00]  It's fine.
[3104.00 --> 3105.00]  It's cool.
[3105.00 --> 3106.00]  We're still cool.
[3106.00 --> 3107.00]  It's all good.
[3107.00 --> 3108.00]  Yeah.
[3108.00 --> 3109.00]  Question number five.
[3109.00 --> 3113.00]  Travis just sent me FIRE in all capital letters, and I'm like, what?
[3113.00 --> 3114.00]  He's like, things are on fire.
[3114.00 --> 3115.00]  I know what you did.
[3115.00 --> 3116.00]  You announced.
[3116.00 --> 3119.00]  He's like, oh my god.
[3119.00 --> 3123.00]  So next question is why do you guys have any cool physical rewards?
[3123.00 --> 3126.00]  And this actually ties into the last one.
[3126.00 --> 3134.00]  We're asking for money so we can move into a bigger space, hire more people and make better content, not so we can sell you a bunch of stickers, t-shirts, and hats.
[3134.00 --> 3138.00]  If you want to contribute to Linus Media Group by buying a t-shirt, then go buy a t-shirt.
[3138.00 --> 3139.00]  We have t-shirts.
[3139.00 --> 3140.00]  Hooray.
[3140.00 --> 3142.00]  We don't need to do a campaign for that.
[3142.00 --> 3145.00]  So on both of our web shops, we have a variety of different shirts.
[3145.00 --> 3152.00]  The usual complaint about the web shops when people say, well, I'd like to buy a t-shirt except, is, OMG, the shipping is so expensive.
[3152.00 --> 3163.00]  To which I'd reply, well, then I guess you figured out why physical merchandise would basically kill any possibility of this campaign funding a move.
[3163.00 --> 3166.00]  The cost doesn't go away because it's a special crowdfunding t-shirt.
[3166.00 --> 3175.00]  So out of that, let's say a $25 reward tier, I'd say is pretty typical for a t-shirt, actually on the high end, we'd still be paying $8 a shirt because we do all of our shirts on American Apparel.
[3175.00 --> 3179.00]  And up to another $13 more for international shipping.
[3179.00 --> 3183.00]  And we're in Canada, so we don't even get cheap domestic shipping to the US.
[3183.00 --> 3186.00]  And people were wondering too about signed stuff.
[3186.00 --> 3192.00]  That's even way worse because we'd have to get it shipped over the border to us and then back over the border somewhere else.
[3192.00 --> 3195.00]  We actually wanted, I mean, and these aren't, it's not like these aren't ideas we've had.
[3195.00 --> 3197.00]  We wanted to do signed posters.
[3197.00 --> 3198.00]  We looked into it.
[3198.00 --> 3199.00]  We had them printed, they're here.
[3199.00 --> 3204.00]  But the problem is that the design didn't end up looking good at all, so we canned it.
[3204.00 --> 3206.00]  But it is something that we do plan to do at some point.
[3206.00 --> 3217.00]  It's just when we're doing a physical merchandise thing, we don't plan, the idea of this is for us to be funding making better and more content for you guys,
[3217.00 --> 3224.00]  not to fund us sitting in the new office packing boxes to ship t-shirts all over the world or whatever else.
[3224.00 --> 3232.00]  And yes, that's a bit of an exaggeration because you could get a service to do that, but then again you're spending even more of the money on having a service take care of it for you.
[3232.00 --> 3235.00]  Which leads us to the last question.
[3235.00 --> 3239.00]  I don't want to contribute because investing in a company without any ROI is stupid.
[3239.00 --> 3241.00]  I want to be a stakeholder.
[3241.00 --> 3243.00]  To which I would reply, we don't want stakeholders.
[3243.00 --> 3248.00]  And I suspect neither do the people who are contributing to the new office expansion.
[3248.00 --> 3251.00]  The closest thing that we actually have to direct backers for our company.
[3251.00 --> 3261.00]  If we had stakeholders and all of a sudden there might be pressure to start paying dividends instead of using that money on responsible things like new gear and sets and employees,
[3261.00 --> 3267.00]  we'd be potentially accountable for the kind of content we're making to some random that the community has never even met.
[3267.00 --> 3276.00]  People are contributing, the ones that are contributing, because they want me in charge, not some shadow lurking in the background potentially pulling strings.
[3276.00 --> 3281.00]  We've stayed away from investment other than this crazy person investing everything,
[3281.00 --> 3286.00]  because it is a scary concept of other people having control over the company.
[3286.00 --> 3288.00]  So we're not really interested in that.
[3288.00 --> 3292.00]  And I can't emphasize that enough, by the way here's the link to the campaign.
[3292.00 --> 3304.00]  I can't emphasize enough that just because we're crowdfunding this doesn't mean that I'm not personally invested and that we're not reinvesting the company's profits into it.
[3304.00 --> 3311.00]  It's not like, I mean you guys I think see that, you know, it's not like I actually drive a Lambo.
[3311.00 --> 3315.00]  I don't actually just blow all my money on frivolous crap.
[3315.00 --> 3317.00]  Like, we're trying to do something here.
[3317.00 --> 3319.00]  We're trying to make more and better content all the time.
[3319.00 --> 3321.00]  And I hope you guys do genuinely see that.
[3321.00 --> 3329.00]  And right now, being in a kitchen is just not the right way for us to move forward with this.
[3329.00 --> 3331.00]  So that's where we're at.
[3331.00 --> 3333.00]  Yeah, I just, yeah.
[3333.00 --> 3337.00]  I have to give a shout out again to Mr. Wizard for being awesome.
[3337.00 --> 3340.00]  We were both up to ridiculous hours of the morning.
[3340.00 --> 3341.00]  Last morning?
[3341.00 --> 3342.00]  This morning?
[3342.00 --> 3343.00]  Last night this morning.
[3343.00 --> 3347.00]  Anyways, he had like three hours of sleep before he went to work and I think he's at work right now.
[3347.00 --> 3351.00]  So, hi Mr. Wizard, you're probably not watching because you're probably busy working.
[3351.00 --> 3352.00]  But, yeah.
[3352.00 --> 3361.00]  So anyway, we made the big thing here is I think we made the reward tiers a lot more fun.
[3361.00 --> 3362.00]  Super fun.
[3362.00 --> 3363.00]  And a lot more attainable.
[3363.00 --> 3364.00]  Super fun.
[3364.00 --> 3368.00]  So we're like 400 bucks away from releasing the original Stormtrooper rap audio.
[3368.00 --> 3372.00]  Something that a lot of people asked for and I said would never happen but Luke and Nick insisted.
[3372.00 --> 3376.00]  Wanshow made up as girls comes another 3,000 after that.
[3376.00 --> 3379.00]  Luke does a Linus Tech Tips video under fire.
[3379.00 --> 3380.00]  I'm actually so excited.
[3380.00 --> 3383.00]  So we get to throw stuff at him the entire time he's filming.
[3383.00 --> 3384.00]  Yeah.
[3384.00 --> 3388.00]  Linus does a Linus Tech Tips video in upper body paint that the entire rest of the company
[3388.00 --> 3390.00]  gets to draw on him and design.
[3390.00 --> 3399.00]  Channel Super Fun comes $2,500 after that and is going to be a video where Luke and I each
[3399.00 --> 3402.00]  get the remotes for shot callers that each other wears for an entire day.
[3402.00 --> 3408.00]  So it's going to be the most aggressive day or the like most kind and polite day at Linus Media Group ever.
[3408.00 --> 3410.00]  Really not sure which way it's going to go with that.
[3410.00 --> 3413.00]  But basically we think we fixed it.
[3413.00 --> 3417.00]  I'll stick around for After Party and I'll talk with you guys if you still have some concerns.
[3417.00 --> 3418.00]  And let's go from there.
[3418.00 --> 3420.00]  But for now I think we've spent enough time during this.
[3420.00 --> 3423.00]  And let's move on to...
[3425.00 --> 3427.00]  Oh, oh balls.
[3427.00 --> 3428.00]  Oh.
[3428.00 --> 3429.00]  Awkward.
[3429.00 --> 3430.00]  Awkward.
[3430.00 --> 3431.00]  Ah.
[3431.00 --> 3432.00]  Nah.
[3432.00 --> 3433.00]  Yeah.
[3433.00 --> 3434.00]  There we go.
[3434.00 --> 3440.00]  Let's move on to keep on digging our Ubisoft segment of the week.
[3440.00 --> 3441.00]  Ubisoft remove...
[3441.00 --> 3442.00]  Actually, oh no, that one's good.
[3442.00 --> 3446.00]  I'm actually going to move that lower third when I talk about the next one.
[3446.00 --> 3447.00]  This is updated in real time.
[3447.00 --> 3448.00]  Okay, cool.
[3448.00 --> 3449.00]  In real time now?
[3449.00 --> 3450.00]  Like it's fixed?
[3450.00 --> 3451.00]  In like...
[3451.00 --> 3454.00]  Oh, okay, so we're like 150 bucks away from Stormtrooper wrap.
[3454.00 --> 3455.00]  In real wizard time.
[3455.00 --> 3457.00]  And yes, we're like 150 bucks away from Stormtrooper wrap.
[3457.00 --> 3462.00]  Alright, so Ubisoft says they will improve Assassin's Creed Unity performance.
[3462.00 --> 3467.00]  They still don't seem to be actually acknowledging what the problems were.
[3467.00 --> 3470.00]  This was originally posted by that cool blue kid on the forum.
[3470.00 --> 3474.00]  And the original articles are from assassinscreed.uby.com and kitguru.net.
[3474.00 --> 3477.00]  I think I'm going to go with the kitguru link for you guys since...
[3477.00 --> 3480.00]  Since it's not an Assassin's Creed page.
[3480.00 --> 3482.00]  Since it's not a UB page.
[3482.00 --> 3483.00]  Yeah.
[3483.00 --> 3487.00]  Basically, they plan the following revisions.
[3487.00 --> 3491.00]  Streamlining some technical aspects of navigation.
[3491.00 --> 3492.00]  So they've...
[3492.00 --> 3493.00]  This is really funny.
[3493.00 --> 3494.00]  I love the way they word this.
[3494.00 --> 3499.30]  We've fixed a number of edge cases with our detection system to smooth certain behaviors
[3499.30 --> 3500.80]  during parkour.
[3500.80 --> 3505.00]  We've fixed a few objects which were improperly tagged to smooth navigation.
[3505.00 --> 3511.00]  Okay, because that was the only problem people had with the game, I guess.
[3511.00 --> 3512.00]  And edge cases.
[3512.00 --> 3514.00]  No, we're not talking edge cases, guys.
[3514.00 --> 3517.00]  We're talking performance issues across the board.
[3517.00 --> 3518.00]  Alright, next up.
[3518.00 --> 3519.00]  In certain edge cases.
[3519.00 --> 3520.00]  Jesus.
[3520.00 --> 3521.00]  Improved task scheduling.
[3521.00 --> 3527.00]  We've tuned the way the computing tasks are prioritized and parallelized by the processor
[3527.00 --> 3530.00]  cores to improve frame rate in certain edge cases.
[3530.00 --> 3531.00]  Parallelized.
[3531.00 --> 3532.00]  Okay.
[3532.00 --> 3535.00]  And then tweaking performance for reach high points.
[3535.00 --> 3540.00]  We've optimized the reach high points during the camera swooping sequence to improve frame rate a little bit.
[3540.00 --> 3545.00]  And they're saying crowd size does not affect frame rate and is not the issue.
[3545.00 --> 3548.00]  I don't think anyone was saying crowd size was the issue.
[3548.00 --> 3552.00]  Because honestly, the models are not that detailed compared to...
[3552.00 --> 3553.00]  Come on.
[3553.00 --> 3554.00]  Like anything.
[3554.00 --> 3555.00]  Like anything.
[3555.00 --> 3559.00]  I mean, they're detailed compared to like Rome Total War.
[3559.00 --> 3560.00]  Yeah.
[3560.00 --> 3561.00]  But...
[3561.00 --> 3563.00]  Again, I can't say this enough.
[3563.00 --> 3565.00]  You're losing to freaking COD.
[3565.00 --> 3566.00]  Like hardcore.
[3566.00 --> 3569.00]  Okay, so the models aren't that detailed in the first place.
[3569.00 --> 3575.00]  I mean, but they, in their own promotional materials, in their own statements, they're saying...
[3575.00 --> 3576.00]  What was it?
[3576.00 --> 3578.00]  Notre Dame alone was how many polygons?
[3578.00 --> 3579.00]  Yeah.
[3579.00 --> 3582.00]  I don't remember it all, but it was a crazy amount.
[3582.00 --> 3583.00]  Polygons.
[3583.00 --> 3586.00]  All the buildings are absolutely insane.
[3586.00 --> 3591.00]  And that's where the alleged rumored draw call bottleneck is occurring.
[3591.00 --> 3595.00]  Not from on-screen characters scaling Notre Dame.
[3595.00 --> 3598.00]  Although I'm sure not on-screen characters aren't exactly easy.
[3598.00 --> 3600.00]  Yeah, but to say...
[3600.00 --> 3603.00]  And I can't imagine that reducing crowd size wouldn't help.
[3603.00 --> 3606.00]  To say they don't affect it is silly.
[3606.00 --> 3607.00]  Yeah.
[3607.00 --> 3610.00]  But to think that that's the problem...
[3610.00 --> 3611.00]  Yeah.
[3611.00 --> 3612.00]  ...as I don't think correct either.
[3612.00 --> 3613.00]  No.
[3613.00 --> 3614.00]  Alright, so...
[3614.00 --> 3618.00]  It would be nice if they just had a slider where you could just control crowd size.
[3618.00 --> 3620.00]  So you're like, hey, done.
[3620.00 --> 3622.00]  That was it for Keep On Diggin'.
[3622.00 --> 3625.00]  Let's move into something Ubisoft did that I personally like.
[3626.00 --> 3631.00]  Ubisoft removes field of view controls in some Far Cry 4 torrents.
[3631.00 --> 3632.00]  I just thought that was funny.
[3632.00 --> 3634.00]  This was posted by Inmigor on the forum.
[3634.00 --> 3637.00]  And the original article we have here is from Gamespot.com.
[3637.00 --> 3638.00]  So I'll go ahead and post that.
[3638.00 --> 3643.00]  But certain Far Cry torrents contain an error which removes the game's field of view controls.
[3643.00 --> 3646.00]  Alex Hutchinson, a creative director at Ubisoft Montreal, wrote on Twitter,
[3646.00 --> 3647.00]  PC players!
[3647.00 --> 3653.00]  If you're online complaining about the lack of FOV control, you pirated the game!
[3653.00 --> 3660.00]  In September, Electronic Arts placed a bug into pirated copy of The Sims 4 where the image becomes increasingly pixelated.
[3660.00 --> 3663.00]  This is not the first time we've seen a strategy like this.
[3663.00 --> 3667.00]  And personally, I really like it because...
[3667.00 --> 3669.00]  I really liked the...
[3669.00 --> 3670.00]  What is it?
[3670.00 --> 3671.00]  Like, game...
[3671.00 --> 3672.00]  Game...
[3672.00 --> 3674.00]  Game creation simulator or Game Tycoon or something?
[3674.00 --> 3677.00]  Well, yeah, but not everyone can include that game with their game or something.
[3678.00 --> 3682.00]  Like, where the game you fail and your company goes bankrupt because...
[3682.00 --> 3683.00]  Because of piracy.
[3683.00 --> 3684.00]  Yes.
[3684.00 --> 3685.00]  That was the best.
[3685.00 --> 3686.00]  And like, no, I know.
[3686.00 --> 3687.00]  Of course not everyone can do something like that.
[3687.00 --> 3689.00]  I just thought that one was super good.
[3689.00 --> 3690.00]  What I like about this...
[3690.00 --> 3693.00]  This strategy is how realistic it is.
[3693.00 --> 3698.00]  Instead of going, okay, our DRM is unbreakable.
[3700.00 --> 3707.00]  Instead of even bothering to say that, they just go, okay, we're gonna put DRM in, we're gonna at least get around the...
[3707.00 --> 3711.00]  And to imagine that DRM doesn't stop some pirates is stupid.
[3711.00 --> 3712.00]  It's stupid.
[3712.00 --> 3714.00]  You're stupid, go be stupid somewhere else.
[3714.00 --> 3716.00]  Because DRM does stop some pirates.
[3716.00 --> 3719.00]  The problem is that it also interferes with regular players.
[3719.00 --> 3723.00]  And I think you could make arguments for it being gotten rid of at all.
[3723.00 --> 3729.00]  But this is not a draconian DRM scheme in and of itself.
[3729.00 --> 3731.00]  I'm not saying the game doesn't have DRM.
[3731.00 --> 3732.00]  So just hold...
[3732.00 --> 3733.00]  Just hold on.
[3733.00 --> 3735.00]  I'm trying to bring up a different thing entirely.
[3735.00 --> 3737.00]  The digging thumbnail is coming back.
[3737.00 --> 3738.00]  Okay.
[3738.00 --> 3739.00]  Okay.
[3739.00 --> 3740.00]  It's coming back.
[3740.00 --> 3741.00]  Okay.
[3741.00 --> 3742.00]  For Ubisoft.
[3742.00 --> 3743.00]  Alright.
[3743.00 --> 3747.00]  The thing about little bugs like this is that they're realistic.
[3747.00 --> 3750.00]  They accept that people are gonna pirate the game.
[3750.00 --> 3761.00]  And what they do is instead of trying to stop them brute force, they create social pressure on pirates to shame them into not pirating the game.
[3761.00 --> 3774.00]  And the thing about putting in a bug like this, especially one that appears later on in the game, is that you're not punishing the guys who really did download it, pirate it as a demo, and then buy it if they liked it to play it.
[3774.00 --> 3779.00]  You are punishing the guys who didn't pay for it and are playing through it.
[3779.00 --> 3795.00]  You're punishing the people who actually did enjoy it enough that they really want to keep playing it badly enough that they really want that FOV slider, and you are making them come out and say, I'm using this, I didn't pay for it, and I'm gonna go and be a customer about it.
[3795.00 --> 3797.00]  I'm gonna actually lodge a complaint.
[3797.00 --> 3798.00]  Post on forums.
[3798.00 --> 3799.00]  Post on forums.
[3799.00 --> 3808.00]  I'm gonna actually have this company spend money answering my question when I didn't even have the respect to pay for the game.
[3808.00 --> 3809.00]  Right.
[3809.00 --> 3810.00]  And I'm playing it.
[3810.00 --> 3811.00]  Shrekt.
[3811.00 --> 3812.00]  So, I like that.
[3812.00 --> 3815.00]  Yeah, I think it's cool having that little easter egg stuff.
[3815.00 --> 3818.00]  By the way, we just hit our wrap goal thing.
[3818.00 --> 3819.00]  Oh lordy, where is that file?
[3819.00 --> 3825.00]  So the release original Stormtroom wrap audio is, that goal has been made.
[3825.00 --> 3833.00]  I have Taryn working on updating the Wansho SoundCloud account for an audio version of Wansho right now.
[3833.00 --> 3837.00]  So I figure we can release that on that SoundCloud account.
[3837.00 --> 3839.00]  So I'll, I'll tweet that out tonight.
[3839.00 --> 3840.00]  I'm gonna see if I can, uh...
[3840.00 --> 3842.00]  Is there a way to do like playlists on SoundCloud?
[3842.00 --> 3847.00]  Cause I wouldn't necessarily want that wrap audio right in the middle, cause a lot of people would listen to it in the stream.
[3847.00 --> 3848.00]  We'll release it on the forum.
[3848.00 --> 3849.00]  Yeah, that'll be doable.
[3849.00 --> 3850.00]  Why don't we release it on the forum?
[3850.00 --> 3851.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[3851.00 --> 3854.00]  Um, I'll see if I can find it right now.
[3854.00 --> 3856.00]  Do you wanna, do you wanna cover the, the next Ubisoft?
[3856.00 --> 3857.00]  Should I put the keep on digging?
[3857.00 --> 3860.00]  Sure, I, oh, oh, this isn't necessarily something else.
[3860.00 --> 3862.00]  I just wanted to talk about the, the, um...
[3862.00 --> 3863.00]  Oh, sorry, this isn't...
[3863.00 --> 3864.00]  DRM stuff.
[3864.00 --> 3865.00]  Nevermind.
[3865.00 --> 3866.00]  Okay, yeah, yeah.
[3866.00 --> 3867.00]  Oh, oh, oh, okay, sorry.
[3867.00 --> 3868.00]  Not a Ubisoft thing.
[3868.00 --> 3869.00]  This is the Denuvo thing, right?
[3869.00 --> 3870.00]  No, this is a Ubisoft thing.
[3870.00 --> 3871.00]  Oh, something else.
[3871.00 --> 3874.00]  Well, it's like, it's, it's like a pretty much, sure.
[3874.00 --> 3875.00]  Should I put the dirt back?
[3875.00 --> 3876.00]  Sure.
[3876.00 --> 3877.00]  Um, okay.
[3877.00 --> 3879.00]  It's like, pretty much everyone that uses DRM thing.
[3879.00 --> 3883.00]  You are saying that to say that DRM doesn't stop some pirates is wrong.
[3883.00 --> 3884.00]  That's false.
[3884.00 --> 3885.00]  You're right.
[3885.00 --> 3890.00]  But, you're not stopping the people that are just downloading the game, really.
[3890.00 --> 3895.00]  Because there's gonna be one group of people that gets through and cracks it, and makes
[3895.00 --> 3899.00]  it so that it's just an executable, and then releases it, so you'll stop a couple different
[3899.00 --> 3900.00]  teams from getting it.
[3900.00 --> 3903.00]  One will make through, and it won't make any difference.
[3903.00 --> 3907.00]  Some games are still more complicated than just running an executable.
[3907.00 --> 3908.00]  Not most anymore.
[3908.00 --> 3909.00]  That's true.
[3909.00 --> 3910.00]  But some are.
[3910.00 --> 3915.00]  Especially multiplayer games are quite a bit more complicated in a lot of cases.
[3915.00 --> 3918.00]  Well, yeah, but then a lot of times they ignore the multiplayer game stuff.
[3918.00 --> 3922.00]  Like, I don't know how it works, but I'm assuming right now with Far Cry 4 you don't get access
[3922.00 --> 3924.00]  to the multiplayer part if you pirate it.
[3924.00 --> 3925.00]  I would assume that too.
[3925.00 --> 3927.00]  You probably just get the single player part.
[3927.00 --> 3928.00]  Um, yeah.
[3928.00 --> 3933.00]  The only time I've heard of, like, cracked multiplayer stuff, you play on your own private
[3933.00 --> 3934.00]  server.
[3934.00 --> 3935.00]  Which is usually kinda lame.
[3935.00 --> 3938.00]  I really didn't wanna release this stupid rap thing.
[3938.00 --> 3939.00]  Rekt.
[3939.00 --> 3940.00]  Uh, and you know what?
[3940.00 --> 3941.00]  I actually can't.
[3941.00 --> 3944.00]  I think there's gonna be other stretch goals that you really don't necessarily wanna do
[3944.00 --> 3945.00]  as well, so.
[3945.00 --> 3946.00]  Yeah, I think there's.
[3946.00 --> 3948.00]  I think you'll just have to get used to that one.
[3948.00 --> 3952.00]  I think there's gonna be, I'm, it's pretty embarrassing.
[3952.00 --> 3953.00]  Um.
[3953.00 --> 3954.00]  Rekt.
[3954.00 --> 3957.00]  The reason why I didn't want it to be in that Wancho SoundCloud is, cause you're listening
[3957.00 --> 3961.00]  to Wancho and then all of a sudden it's like, do you know bleep about swag?
[3961.00 --> 3962.00]  Yeah.
[3962.00 --> 3964.00]  Blah blah blah, terrible rap song.
[3964.00 --> 3965.00]  It's pretty terrible.
[3965.00 --> 3969.00]  I really, I really didn't want, cause the filter was what I kinda.
[3969.00 --> 3970.00]  You guys are taking away his auto tune.
[3970.00 --> 3975.00]  What was what kind of made it okay for me, but now it's just pretty embarrassing.
[3975.00 --> 3979.00]  So I'm, I'm throwing, I'm emailing myself the, uh, the wave sound right now.
[3979.00 --> 3983.00]  And then I'll, I'll see if, uh, maybe we'll, we'll play it on after party.
[3983.00 --> 3986.00]  Yeah, let's, let's play it on after party when we're doing the, uh, the Q and A and then
[3986.00 --> 3990.00]  we'll make it available for download on the forum if you guys really want it.
[3990.00 --> 3991.00]  All right.
[3991.00 --> 3992.00]  All right.
[3992.00 --> 3996.00]  Let's move into our next DRM topic, not related to Ubisoft.
[3996.00 --> 3999.00]  So the keep on digging, uh, lower third can go away.
[3999.00 --> 4002.00]  This was originally posted by someone on the forum.
[4002.00 --> 4004.00]  My browser is just, where are we looking?
[4004.00 --> 4005.00]  What is it?
[4005.00 --> 4006.00]  It's further down.
[4010.00 --> 4011.00]  There we go.
[4011.00 --> 4014.00]  So DeNuvo DRM degrades SSDs.
[4014.00 --> 4020.00]  This is posted by Ah Ming on the forum and it's from gamemag.ru.ru.
[4020.00 --> 4021.00]  Um.
[4021.00 --> 4027.00]  So games like Lord of the Fallen, FIFA 15, and unfortunately Dragon Age Inquisition, um, are
[4027.00 --> 4028.00]  affected by this.
[4028.00 --> 4029.00]  It's EA time again.
[4029.00 --> 4030.00]  Yeah.
[4030.00 --> 4031.00]  It is EA time again.
[4031.00 --> 4036.00]  EA bought a jelly time, EA bought a jelly time, EA bought a jelly time, way yeah, way yeah,
[4036.00 --> 4037.00]  way yeah.
[4037.00 --> 4038.00]  That's so old.
[4038.00 --> 4039.00]  That is really old.
[4039.00 --> 4040.00]  Go ahead.
[4040.00 --> 4041.00]  Um.
[4041.00 --> 4045.00]  And what's weird is I think that was probably more popular than the Badger Badger song.
[4045.00 --> 4050.00]  But I hear people reiterating Badger Badger more than that.
[4050.00 --> 4051.00]  Those early internet days.
[4051.00 --> 4053.00]  Like it wasn't as good of a song.
[4053.00 --> 4054.00]  No.
[4054.00 --> 4055.00]  Badger Badger Badger Badger.
[4055.00 --> 4056.00]  It's a lot more catchy.
[4056.00 --> 4057.00]  Yeah.
[4057.00 --> 4058.00]  Anyway.
[4058.00 --> 4061.00]  It's not like it's gonna instantly kill your SSD.
[4061.00 --> 4068.00]  But, users are reporting significant increases in the rights on their SSDs while running these
[4068.00 --> 4069.00]  games.
[4069.00 --> 4073.00]  And it is being attributed to the Denuvo DRM scheme.
[4073.00 --> 4078.00]  Up to around 30 gigabytes of data every 40 minutes in very small bits of code.
[4078.00 --> 4079.00]  That's insane.
[4079.00 --> 4086.00]  Now, to be clear, SSDs are not as fragile as they used to be and as a lot of people seem
[4086.00 --> 4087.00]  to think they are.
[4087.00 --> 4091.00]  In fact, Tech Report has an excellent ongoing article.
[4091.00 --> 4093.00]  I would like to find it to link it to you guys right now.
[4093.00 --> 4095.00]  But, Chrome completely crashed.
[4095.00 --> 4099.00]  The greatness of the Stormtrooper wrap crashed Chrome.
[4099.00 --> 4101.00]  So, um.
[4101.00 --> 4104.00]  So, I would love to link that to you guys.
[4104.00 --> 4108.00]  But, basically they've taken, I think it was about a half a dozen consumer grade SSDs.
[4108.00 --> 4113.00]  And just put them on a bench where they're being written to constantly and then monitored.
[4113.00 --> 4116.00]  So, every once in a while they take them off the bench and see if they're still working.
[4116.00 --> 4120.00]  And they all go way past their rated write speeds.
[4120.00 --> 4124.00]  Which is already way more than most people are going to write to it.
[4124.00 --> 4126.00]  But, 30 gigs per 40 minutes.
[4126.00 --> 4132.00]  We can extrapolate that to 45 gigs per hour for a game that you could potentially log a hundred hours on.
[4132.00 --> 4133.00]  A hundred hours on.
[4133.00 --> 4135.00]  A game like Dragon Age Inquisition.
[4135.00 --> 4138.00]  I logged a hundred hours easy on Origin.
[4138.00 --> 4139.00]  Yeah.
[4139.00 --> 4140.00]  I don't know if it's going to be-
[4140.00 --> 4141.00]  Origins.
[4141.00 --> 4142.00]  I hate Origin.
[4142.00 --> 4143.00]  Love Origins.
[4143.00 --> 4145.00]  I don't know if it's going to be quite as big of a game.
[4145.00 --> 4147.00]  But it'll still be a very expansive.
[4147.00 --> 4149.00]  Like, it's going to take a while.
[4149.00 --> 4150.00]  For sure.
[4150.00 --> 4151.00]  Yeah.
[4151.00 --> 4152.00]  Um.
[4152.00 --> 4161.00]  But, that is still a completely unnecessary thing to do that damages the computer hardware that the game is installed on.
[4161.00 --> 4162.00]  And I do not approve of that whatsoever.
[4162.00 --> 4163.00]  Yeah.
[4163.00 --> 4164.00]  That's no fun.
[4164.00 --> 4165.00]  Alright.
[4165.00 --> 4166.00]  What else we got here?
[4166.00 --> 4168.00]  We got lots of great topics still this week.
[4168.00 --> 4170.00]  There's the wow thing.
[4170.00 --> 4171.00]  There's the counter strike thing.
[4171.00 --> 4173.00]  Oh, let's do the counter strike thing.
[4173.00 --> 4174.00]  Okay.
[4174.00 --> 4175.00]  How much do you know about this?
[4175.00 --> 4178.00]  Because this is very much an in development story right now.
[4178.00 --> 4179.00]  Yeah.
[4179.00 --> 4182.00]  So you guys will have to forgive us if we're a little bit behind the eight ball or-
[4182.00 --> 4189.00]  Forgive us if we're a little bit behind and take everything with a grain of salt because a lot of this right now is kind of speculation.
[4189.00 --> 4190.00]  Speculation.
[4190.00 --> 4193.00]  It's speculation that's happening now.
[4193.00 --> 4194.00]  Yeah.
[4194.00 --> 4197.00]  There's definitely some weight behind the speculation.
[4197.00 --> 4198.00]  Yeah.
[4198.00 --> 4199.00]  Um.
[4199.00 --> 4200.00]  But it's still a lot of speculation.
[4200.00 --> 4208.00]  Now things that aren't speculation is that two players from top 20 global pro teams have been VAC banned.
[4208.00 --> 4213.00]  And I believe two teams have been dropped out of the Winter Dreamhack tournament.
[4213.00 --> 4214.00]  Yeah.
[4214.00 --> 4217.00]  So we're talking a quarter million dollar prize.
[4217.00 --> 4222.00]  And they have been disqualified for players on their teams.
[4222.00 --> 4227.00]  And their teams have kicked those two players out of their respective teams at this point in time.
[4227.00 --> 4228.00]  Um.
[4228.00 --> 4230.00]  So they're not trying to back them up or fight it.
[4230.00 --> 4231.00]  They got kicked out.
[4231.00 --> 4232.00]  Yeah.
[4232.00 --> 4235.00]  Both players admitted to using, uh, to using an exploit.
[4235.00 --> 4239.00]  I'm going to call it an exploit as opposed to, uh, let's just call it a cheat, I guess.
[4239.00 --> 4240.00]  Yeah.
[4240.00 --> 4241.00]  Yeah.
[4241.00 --> 4242.00]  Yeah.
[4242.00 --> 4245.00]  I mean, the way the cheat was executed is you could call an exploit.
[4245.00 --> 4246.00]  Uh, theoretically.
[4246.00 --> 4247.00]  Theoretically.
[4247.00 --> 4248.00]  This is speculation.
[4248.00 --> 4249.00]  This is all speculative.
[4249.00 --> 4252.00]  But again, it makes a ton of sense on a lot of people.
[4252.00 --> 4256.00]  This has been going around like through the grapevine for a while now that this might have been happening.
[4256.00 --> 4262.00]  So the fact that this is now going on validates that a little bit.
[4262.00 --> 4270.00]  But the idea is that they were getting this, uh, hack or cheat or whatever, exploit, whatever you want to call it, through the, uh, what is it called?
[4270.00 --> 4271.00]  The Steam Workshop.
[4271.00 --> 4272.00]  The Steam Workshop.
[4272.00 --> 4279.00]  So even if you were at a quote unquote LAN event, which is just where the other team you're playing against is also there and your team is there.
[4279.00 --> 4281.00]  You're not just on LAN.
[4281.00 --> 4283.00]  You usually have an internet connection because they're usually streamed.
[4283.00 --> 4292.00]  Um, even at a LAN event where you're not using your own computer, they would sign into their own accounts because they want to show if there's skins and stuff because it's CSGO.
[4292.00 --> 4299.00]  Um, and then the Steam Workshop would automatically download it onto that computer.
[4299.00 --> 4302.00]  So you wouldn't see them like installing anything fishy.
[4302.00 --> 4304.00]  It would just happen automatically in the background.
[4304.00 --> 4311.00]  Um, and the way it allegedly works, it could be, it could be done very, very subtly.
[4311.00 --> 4324.00]  So, uh, for example, one of the ones I was talking to Ed about earlier today was a wall hack that all it would do was change the color of one pixel when there is an opposing character on the other side of a surface.
[4324.00 --> 4337.00]  Even someone looking over your shoulder might kind of go, well, and then, and then move on because if they weren't aware of, if they weren't aware to look for something like that, then how could they possibly know?
[4337.00 --> 4341.00]  Or even stuff like, um, audio cues.
[4341.00 --> 4344.00]  Like, it could ping an audio cue if you're pointing at someone through a wall.
[4344.00 --> 4348.00]  So if you do a sweep across a wall, it could ping at you if there's an, if there's something there.
[4348.00 --> 4349.00]  A lot of the guys wear earbuds.
[4349.00 --> 4357.00]  Yep, there was, uh, allegedly, rumoredly, speculatedly, a panic button, uh, one button sort of toggled aim assist.
[4357.00 --> 4363.00]  All of this is unconfirmed by any legitimate source and is based on code of the hack briefly posted to Reddit.
[4363.00 --> 4377.00]  Um, there's speculation that there was, so button toggled vision assist, audio cue'd vision assist, and then button toggled aim assist were all allegedly within this steam workshop allegedly downloaded, uh, hacks.
[4377.00 --> 4379.00]  So, all of this is maybes.
[4379.00 --> 4396.00]  Both, okay, what's not maybes is both of the players that were banned, so Kali, uh, spelled K-Q-L-Y, from Titan, and SF from Epsilon, so these guys are from globally 9th ranked teams and 19th ranked teams overall, have admitted to using them.
[4396.00 --> 4403.00]  So, Kali released a statement apologizing for the behavior and assuring everyone that the cheating did not occur in a competitive setting.
[4403.00 --> 4408.00]  And then Epsilon, uh, I think, alleged, uh, admitted to using it once.
[4408.00 --> 4415.00]  And also not in a competitive setting, although that looks like it's been pulled out of the dock since I was reading it before the show, so that might-
[4415.00 --> 4416.00]  So who knows.
[4416.00 --> 4422.00]  Everything is very much in flux right now, but the big discussion here is, what do we compare this to?
[4422.00 --> 4423.00]  I mean, what does-
[4423.00 --> 4425.00]  No, neither cheats were used in a competitive setting, it just dropped down.
[4425.00 --> 4432.00]  Okay, so what does it, what does it, what does it mean for, for CSGO's credibility as an esport?
[4432.00 --> 4433.00]  It's rough.
[4433.00 --> 4434.00]  That this made it through.
[4434.00 --> 4451.00]  I know Nick has been talking about, like, um, Hellfire, essentially, like if this, if this gets proven, and if like certain members, not necessarily these two, but certain very prominent members, and he has very good reasoning for all of this, if they get brought out, because there's, there's a list that the original guy that got banned posted.
[4451.00 --> 4463.00]  Yep, trying to take a bunch of other guys down with him, where he said, I think, what, was he 95, he said he was 95% sure, and produced a list of other high level pro players that he thought were cheating using the same hack.
[4463.00 --> 4473.00]  Yeah, so certain members on there, specifically the fanatic guys, two of the fanatic guys, if, if they got called out for actually doing this, and they got vac banned, it could cause some serious rifts.
[4473.00 --> 4477.00]  I mean, pro cycling has not recovered from doping.
[4477.00 --> 4478.00]  Yes, yeah.
[4478.00 --> 4482.00]  Major League Baseball is a joke, because of steroids.
[4482.00 --> 4483.00]  Yeah.
[4483.00 --> 4486.00]  Shooters have always been a huge problem.
[4486.00 --> 4490.00]  Even on console, there's hardware hacks you can do to controllers.
[4490.00 --> 4493.00]  Try not allowing people to bring their controllers to events.
[4493.00 --> 4495.00]  No, they want to use their scuff, they want to use their whatever.
[4495.00 --> 4500.00]  There's approved controllers for events, and you can bring your own, and you can hardware hack it.
[4500.00 --> 4509.00]  You take the thing apart, add in a little bit of, the last one I saw was a PCB that you added in, which made it so that you could just hold the trigger down,
[4509.00 --> 4514.00]  and it would shoot a semi-automatic weapon as fast as it possibly could, while keeping it fairly accurate.
[4514.00 --> 4515.00]  Right.
[4515.00 --> 4517.00]  You just hold the trigger down, and it does it properly for you.
[4517.00 --> 4518.00]  That's cheating.
[4518.00 --> 4520.00]  Super cheating.
[4520.00 --> 4522.00]  And that's something you can do on a console.
[4522.00 --> 4526.00]  So there's, there's cheating, and shooters cheating is huge, and it's super frustrating.
[4526.00 --> 4531.00]  It's really annoying as a player, just playing randomly, because it happens a lot in lobbies.
[4531.00 --> 4532.00]  I know.
[4532.00 --> 4533.00]  Yeah.
[4533.00 --> 4537.00]  I mean, imagine, if this is happening professionally, where people are actually looking over the shoulder of the person,
[4537.00 --> 4544.00]  what's going on with people in their bedrooms playing the game, where mom doesn't care if they're cheating at CSGO.
[4544.00 --> 4549.00]  And think about the amount of people that are cheating that you're not catching, because they're being very subtle about it.
[4549.00 --> 4550.00]  Yeah.
[4550.00 --> 4557.00]  Compared to that dude that's like flying around the map, insta-killing everyone, which happened the first day I tried to play COD, which was hilarious.
[4557.00 --> 4565.00]  His name was like 420BlazeAtYOLO, and he killed everyone on the map instantly and was just flying around.
[4565.00 --> 4567.00]  I was like, wow!
[4567.00 --> 4570.00]  You are everything that's wrong with this game.
[4572.00 --> 4573.00]  It was fantastic.
[4573.00 --> 4574.00]  It happened on stream.
[4574.00 --> 4576.00]  Anyways, like, it's, it's bad.
[4576.00 --> 4582.00]  I don't know it's gonna, I don't know if it's necessarily gonna be the hellfire that a lot of people have been talking about,
[4582.00 --> 4586.00]  where it's just gonna destroy the entire sport, because it is actually really old.
[4586.00 --> 4592.00]  People have been playing CSGO for a really long, or it's Counter-Strike competitively for a really long time, not necessarily CSGO.
[4592.00 --> 4594.00]  I know, Valve seems to think it's a big deal.
[4594.00 --> 4595.00]  They're flying in-
[4595.00 --> 4596.00]  Valve's cracking down like crazy.
[4596.00 --> 4602.00]  They're flying in four teams to replace the two teams that were disqualified from Dreamhack to do a, like, a local pre-qualifier.
[4602.00 --> 4605.00]  Which is sick. That's super cool. I'm happy they're doing that.
[4605.00 --> 4607.00]  Um, I'm not saying it's-
[4607.00 --> 4609.00]  Well, they have no choice. They have to salvage their tournament.
[4609.00 --> 4610.00]  Yeah, no, that's true.
[4610.00 --> 4615.00]  I'm not saying it's not gonna be a big deal. I just don't think it's necessarily gonna destroy the entire thing.
[4615.00 --> 4622.00]  Um, I think it could seriously, uh, hamper the massive growth that they've had over the last little while.
[4622.00 --> 4626.00]  And it could seriously plateau them for a long time, or make it go down a little bit.
[4626.00 --> 4632.00]  The thing about games that has to grow up is, is both sides.
[4632.00 --> 4636.00]  The fans are already growing up in the sense that they're treating it more seriously.
[4636.00 --> 4637.00]  Like, I-
[4637.00 --> 4638.00]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[4638.00 --> 4643.00]  Okay, the thing about this is, they were talking about this on, um, that sports radio station that I listen to all the time.
[4643.00 --> 4647.00]  They were talking about it, um, when they got acquired by TSN.
[4647.00 --> 4655.00]  And some of those guys were ex-TSN guys from back when TSN started, and were now being brought back into the TSN fold.
[4655.00 --> 4664.00]  So they were kind of reminiscing about how 30 years ago everyone told them they were idiots for thinking that you could have an entire channel dedicated just to sports.
[4664.00 --> 4666.00]  That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
[4666.00 --> 4668.00]  And then, they're like, yeah, look at it now.
[4668.00 --> 4669.00]  Yeah.
[4669.00 --> 4673.00]  TSN 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, Ruby, Platinum, Emeralds.
[4673.00 --> 4674.00]  Yeah.
[4674.00 --> 4686.00]  Like, so, so, but the thing about, the thing about sports, and eSports do get qualified as sports in this way, I guess.
[4686.00 --> 4689.00]  Okay, they're not sports, they're eSports, but they get treated the same way this way.
[4689.00 --> 4691.00]  Is that the fans are very passionate.
[4691.00 --> 4692.00]  Yep.
[4692.00 --> 4693.00]  And they take it very seriously.
[4693.00 --> 4694.00]  Oh yeah.
[4694.00 --> 4697.00]  And that's what eSports is finally gaining.
[4697.00 --> 4698.00]  They're being taken seriously.
[4698.00 --> 4700.00]  They're not a joke anymore.
[4700.00 --> 4701.00]  So...
[4701.00 --> 4703.00]  You're gonna lose that reputation if people start hacking.
[4703.00 --> 4717.00]  Turning it into a joke, and not having the players and the organizations treating it as seriously as the fans are, is gonna create a rift between the fans and the players and the organizers.
[4717.00 --> 4719.00]  And that is really hard to fix.
[4719.00 --> 4729.00]  And when you have this momentum right now, I think if this goes as deep as the allegations would suggest that they could,
[4729.00 --> 4732.00]  I think it could affect not just CSGO, but eSports in general.
[4732.00 --> 4733.00]  It could.
[4733.00 --> 4738.00]  Because you, because you look at the general complaints that people might have about an eSport.
[4738.00 --> 4740.00]  Oh, well, it's just software.
[4740.00 --> 4743.00]  So how easy is it to cheat?
[4743.00 --> 4747.00]  How easy is it to pretend that these guys playing are really that superhuman?
[4747.00 --> 4748.00]  Yeah.
[4748.00 --> 4749.00]  Apparently this easy.
[4749.00 --> 4752.00]  How are we gonna take this seriously anymore?
[4752.00 --> 4758.00]  At least with a physical sport, yes, there's blood doping, there's steroids, there's this, there's that.
[4758.00 --> 4760.00]  We can catch a lot of it.
[4760.00 --> 4763.00]  And they are actually doing it on some level.
[4763.00 --> 4772.00]  There's no cybernetic implant that, you know, tells the goalie where to be, so when the puck's gonna be there and whatever, and they just can be there already.
[4772.00 --> 4773.00]  Yeah.
[4773.00 --> 4782.00]  That's the difference between electronic cheating and physical cheating, is it can happen in ways that the viewer doesn't even understand is happening.
[4782.00 --> 4789.00]  And all the respect that they might have had for a player, or a skill, or a tactic, I mean, it's just gone.
[4789.00 --> 4790.00]  How deflating is that?
[4790.00 --> 4797.00]  This is actually a big part of the reason why some of the viewers I know are gonna be like, what, when I bring this up.
[4797.00 --> 4805.00]  But I've, well, a long time ago I played Counter-Strike at a fairly high level, but I've never really been interested in watching Counter-Strike.
[4805.00 --> 4814.00]  Um, and playing on public servers has always been kinda rough, because every single time that someone does something amazing, you're like, hmm.
[4814.00 --> 4816.00]  They're probably cheating.
[4816.00 --> 4817.00]  They're probably cheating.
[4817.00 --> 4819.00]  Or that was the luckiest thing ever.
[4819.00 --> 4823.00]  And that's actually one of the reasons I'm gonna go on like an old Counter-Strike kinda binge here, if you don't mind.
[4823.00 --> 4826.00]  How old are we talking, like, 1.6?
[4826.00 --> 4827.00]  Okay, that's not that old.
[4827.00 --> 4828.00]  Um, that's okay.
[4828.00 --> 4829.00]  1.6, 1.5, like...
[4829.00 --> 4830.00]  Really, you're gonna go back to 1.5?
[4830.00 --> 4832.00]  Well, old stuff.
[4832.00 --> 4842.00]  Um, if you were running and or jumping or doing something crazy with an AWP, there was like the really weird, really low percentage chance that you could shoot yourself.
[4842.00 --> 4844.00]  If you tried to shoot while you're doing that.
[4844.00 --> 4849.00]  If you like jumped off of something and took a shot, it was a very low percentage chance, but you could damage yourself.
[4849.00 --> 4852.00]  So like, no one really did it.
[4852.00 --> 4860.00]  Now, some guy will jump off a ledge and like aim up here with a pistol and get a headshot over there, and be like, oh yeah, no man, no, no, it's just randomly shot over there.
[4860.00 --> 4861.00]  It's like, no.
[4861.00 --> 4868.00]  One of the videos that they have of one of the guys that got banned, he shot way far away from someone and got a headshot, and people were dismissing it.
[4868.00 --> 4871.00]  Like, oh no, it's probably just like bullet stray because he was jumping.
[4871.00 --> 4873.00]  It's like, no, he was hacking then.
[4873.00 --> 4874.00]  Brutal.
[4874.00 --> 4875.00]  Come on.
[4875.00 --> 4877.00]  Ugh, I don't know.
[4877.00 --> 4879.00]  So there you go.
[4879.00 --> 4880.00]  I don't know.
[4880.00 --> 4881.00]  Brutal.
[4881.00 --> 4884.00]  We can do a few, let's do a few rapid fire topics.
[4884.00 --> 4886.00]  Oh, this isn't really rapid fire.
[4886.00 --> 4887.00]  Oh, we gotta talk about this.
[4887.00 --> 4890.00]  BitTorrent opens Paygate Premium Bundles.
[4890.00 --> 4894.00]  The original articles on TechCrunch.com was posted by TechDreamer on the forum.
[4894.00 --> 4896.00]  This is freaking cool.
[4896.00 --> 4904.00]  I mean, I don't think it's gonna turn BitTorrent into, you know, a legitimate content distribution network overnight.
[4904.00 --> 4910.00]  But, they're giving 90% of the funds to the content creator.
[4910.00 --> 4916.00]  And when we compare that to other services that exist, like if you were to say publish your song behind a paywall,
[4916.00 --> 4919.00]  so that means people, that just means people have to pay for the content, okay?
[4919.00 --> 4925.00]  So behind a paywall on iTunes, Apple's taking what, 40 cents on the dollar?
[4925.00 --> 4926.00]  Something along those lines?
[4926.00 --> 4927.00]  Yeah.
[4927.00 --> 4931.00]  So this is fantastic for new artists using BitTorrent as a distribution platform.
[4931.00 --> 4937.00]  So peer-to-peer, not BitTorrent like YAR, BitTorrent like peer-to-peer connections.
[4937.00 --> 4940.00]  And getting 90% of the money for yourself?
[4940.00 --> 4941.00]  That's fantastic.
[4941.00 --> 4943.00]  That's actually pretty freaking awesome.
[4943.00 --> 4945.00]  I guess that's all there really is to say about it.
[4945.00 --> 4947.00]  Yeah, there's not a ton to really add.
[4947.00 --> 4950.00]  But I think it's awesome and I do really hope people start using it.
[4950.00 --> 4953.00]  I expect kind of smaller groups to start using it.
[4953.00 --> 4960.00]  And hopefully, those like one or two really big bands to just jump onto it, because that will popularize it.
[4960.00 --> 4963.00]  And then it can grow from there, because hopefully this becomes a big thing.
[4963.00 --> 4969.00]  So, you can, and the publisher has a lot of flexibility, and I'd imagine they're gonna continue to tweak it over time.
[4969.00 --> 4971.00]  But you can have some content for free.
[4971.00 --> 4974.00]  There can be some behind a paywall.
[4974.00 --> 4979.00]  You can have content move to paywall after a certain number of visits, for example.
[4979.00 --> 4981.00]  That's cool.
[4981.00 --> 4987.00]  Also, unlike iTunes, you can potentially have access to your customer information.
[4987.00 --> 4991.00]  That's one of the big problems that I have with platforms like iTunes and like YouTube.
[4991.00 --> 4997.00]  Or even Twitch to a much lesser extent than, actually no, Twitch is pretty much the same.
[4997.00 --> 5000.00]  Yeah, is you guys, I don't know who you are.
[5000.00 --> 5001.00]  Yeah.
[5001.00 --> 5003.00]  I have no way to communicate with you.
[5003.00 --> 5004.00]  Uh, that's not true with Twitch.
[5004.00 --> 5005.00]  Okay.
[5005.00 --> 5006.00]  Yes.
[5006.00 --> 5007.00]  You have a list of all your subscribers.
[5007.00 --> 5008.00]  YouTube used to have that.
[5008.00 --> 5009.00]  YouTube took it away.
[5009.00 --> 5010.00]  Yeah.
[5010.00 --> 5011.00]  So I didn't realize Twitch still had it.
[5011.00 --> 5012.00]  Okay.
[5012.00 --> 5013.00]  I don't know if you, okay.
[5013.00 --> 5014.00]  I don't know how easily you can contact them.
[5014.00 --> 5015.00]  You have a list of all your subs.
[5015.00 --> 5018.00]  I don't know if you have a list of all your followers.
[5018.00 --> 5019.00]  I, oh.
[5019.00 --> 5020.00]  That's very different.
[5020.00 --> 5021.00]  Subs are paying.
[5021.00 --> 5022.00]  Right.
[5022.00 --> 5023.00]  Okay.
[5023.00 --> 5024.00]  Okay.
[5024.00 --> 5027.00]  So, YouTube used to give you an entire list of your subscribers.
[5027.00 --> 5031.00]  And even though you couldn't send a mass email to them and say, hey, I'm moving over to Vimeo.
[5031.00 --> 5033.00]  Can you please make sure to subscribe to me over there?
[5033.00 --> 5036.00]  Because that would facilitate moving off of the platform, right?
[5036.00 --> 5040.00]  Um, but what you could do is you could message them one by one.
[5040.00 --> 5045.00]  And in the even earlier days, uh, you could even see the list of subscribers for someone else's YouTube channel.
[5045.00 --> 5046.00]  Yeah.
[5046.00 --> 5053.00]  So, some douche canoe, um, who was a competing tech YouTuber at the time, actually went through my entire sublist.
[5053.00 --> 5054.00]  Really?
[5054.00 --> 5055.00]  And messaged every single one of them.
[5055.00 --> 5056.00]  I got so many complaints about it.
[5056.00 --> 5057.00]  Blah, blah, blah.
[5057.00 --> 5058.00]  Do you know what this guy's doing?
[5058.00 --> 5059.00]  I was like, no.
[5059.00 --> 5060.00]  Oh my God.
[5060.00 --> 5061.00]  Yeah.
[5061.00 --> 5062.00]  Go figure, eh?
[5062.00 --> 5063.00]  That's brutal.
[5063.00 --> 5065.00]  Um, so I understand reasons why this information isn't exposed.
[5065.00 --> 5070.00]  And I know that Google has improved that recently through Google Plus.
[5070.00 --> 5074.00]  Where you can access some of your most engaged viewers and all that.
[5074.00 --> 5080.00]  But that's the problem with these distribution networks is they lock you in like this.
[5080.00 --> 5095.00]  Whereas if you own the relationship with your audience, then you can move wherever is best for you and or best for them as opposed to being stuck where someone just wants to take a big cut of the money for something they didn't even create.
[5095.00 --> 5096.00]  And aren't even gonna watch.
[5096.00 --> 5097.00]  Yeah.
[5097.00 --> 5098.00]  Yeah.
[5098.00 --> 5099.00]  That's kinda ridiculous.
[5099.00 --> 5100.00]  That's pretty much it.
[5100.00 --> 5103.00]  Someone in the chat, sorry I was trying to watch the chat for someone to correct me.
[5103.00 --> 5105.00]  Apparently, uh, you do have a followers list.
[5105.00 --> 5106.00]  Okay, there you go.
[5106.00 --> 5108.00]  So you have a sublist and a followers list.
[5108.00 --> 5110.00]  Apparently douche canoe is not a thing?
[5110.00 --> 5111.00]  I've heard that.
[5111.00 --> 5112.00]  Really?
[5112.00 --> 5113.00]  Was it me?
[5113.00 --> 5114.00]  Maybe.
[5114.00 --> 5115.00]  That's possible.
[5115.00 --> 5118.00]  I remember it was a big thing.
[5118.00 --> 5125.00]  My group of friends got called douche carts one year at PAX and we were like, wow, that's amazing.
[5125.00 --> 5127.00]  And we kind of adopted that for a little while.
[5127.00 --> 5128.00]  There are so many great topics left.
[5128.00 --> 5129.00]  We have to go really fast.
[5129.00 --> 5130.00]  Keystone Cat posted this.
[5130.00 --> 5132.00]  This is from MumbaiMirror.com.
[5132.00 --> 5136.00]  Electronics printed with a t-shirt printer.
[5136.00 --> 5138.00]  Holy actual crap.
[5138.00 --> 5145.00]  This combined with 3D printing would literally mean printing your own consumer electronics.
[5145.00 --> 5147.00]  Very simple ones.
[5147.00 --> 5148.00]  Yeah.
[5148.00 --> 5151.00]  I mean, we're talking like, what were they saying they printed?
[5151.00 --> 5155.00]  Like a four bit, um, hold on.
[5155.00 --> 5156.00]  Doesn't show.
[5156.00 --> 5157.00]  Yeah, it's not in the notes.
[5157.00 --> 5160.00]  It's in the article, but super, super simple stuff.
[5160.00 --> 5165.00]  But the electronic circuits are printed using unique materials, environmentally friendly methods,
[5165.00 --> 5170.00]  and the way, on top of everyday flexible materials such as plastic, aluminum foil, and even paper.
[5170.00 --> 5180.00]  Resistors, transistors, and capacitors, the key components of a complex electric circuit are printed using non-toxic organic materials like silver nanoparticles, carbon, and plastics.
[5180.00 --> 5183.00]  So a new startup company is being established to commercialize the invention,
[5183.00 --> 5190.00]  and a multinational biomedical company has also expressed interest in adopting the application of printed electronics for biomedical devices.
[5190.00 --> 5191.00]  Wow.
[5191.00 --> 5192.00]  Super cool.
[5192.00 --> 5193.00]  What a big deal.
[5193.00 --> 5195.00]  You just talked really fast.
[5195.00 --> 5196.00]  Sorry.
[5196.00 --> 5197.00]  You got it though.
[5197.00 --> 5198.00]  Thank you.
[5198.00 --> 5199.00]  That was a good job.
[5199.00 --> 5200.00]  Um, so that's cool.
[5200.00 --> 5204.00]  Oh, Nvidia's multi-frame anti-aliasing has finally been tested.
[5204.00 --> 5212.00]  So our good buddy Ryan Shrout over at PC Perspective has taken a pretty, I'm not going to call it in-depth, Ryan, but I'll call it-
[5212.00 --> 5213.00]  Oh, Rex.
[5213.00 --> 5217.00]  I'll call it a pretty, a pretty adequate look at MFAA.
[5217.00 --> 5224.00]  Now the problem with the way most people are going to try and look at MFAA is they're going to try and take a screenshot or a FRAPS recording.
[5224.00 --> 5225.00]  That won't work.
[5225.00 --> 5236.00]  Because the way screenshots and FRAPS recordings work is they take an image of the frame that is being presented at an earlier stage than the actual display output.
[5236.00 --> 5251.00]  Now the way MFAA works is it actually blends the anti-aliasing that it's applying in one matrix on the previous frame and in another matrix on the next frame together on the frame that the viewer sees.
[5251.00 --> 5252.00]  Okay.
[5252.00 --> 5269.00]  So it, it, it does 2x MSAA effectively in two different ways and then present it to the viewer as 4x MSAA, but they're calling it MFAA because it's not quite the same thing because it's using this blending technique.
[5269.00 --> 5271.00]  So in stills, okay, right.
[5271.00 --> 5281.00]  So the way you have to capture it is by actually capturing the display output using a capture card, something that PCPer already does for all of their graphics card benchmarks.
[5281.00 --> 5291.00]  Anyway, so they went ahead and did some captures and you guys should definitely check out the article where you can have a much better look at what they look like than this, you know, compressed video view here.
[5291.00 --> 5297.00]  But it looks pretty darn good in relatively non complex scenarios.
[5297.00 --> 5307.00]  It looks a lot closer to MF to 4x MSAA than to 2x MSAA and the performance hit is not as much as 4x MSAA.
[5307.00 --> 5309.00]  In more complex scenes.
[5309.00 --> 5313.00]  So there was one from, I think, crisis three that Ryan was looking at.
[5313.00 --> 5320.00]  It didn't look as good as 4x MSAA but still better than 2x and the performance hit is less.
[5320.00 --> 5323.00]  So Nvidia's technology looks like a winner.
[5323.00 --> 5328.00]  Except right now it's only compatible with 20 games.
[5328.00 --> 5334.00]  Now, so it's a white listed game support as opposed to black listing the ones that don't work.
[5334.00 --> 5338.00]  So it looks like Nvidia is going through and specifically validating games.
[5338.00 --> 5344.00]  Once they add it to GeForce Experience so it turns on and off automatically, I guess this is less of a concern.
[5344.00 --> 5350.00]  But right now it just doesn't give you any warning whatsoever if you launch a game and it says,
[5350.00 --> 5353.00]  it doesn't come up and say, hey, by the way, your MFAA isn't working.
[5353.00 --> 5354.00]  There's going to be more of a performance hit.
[5354.00 --> 5356.00]  You might want to tweak your settings.
[5356.00 --> 5362.00]  So it just happens in the background on white listed games and we have no idea what support's going to look like moving forward.
[5362.00 --> 5364.00]  There is no SLI support yet.
[5364.00 --> 5366.00]  So only single card support.
[5366.00 --> 5369.00]  But it's working for now.
[5369.00 --> 5371.00]  For now.
[5371.00 --> 5373.00]  In certain things.
[5373.00 --> 5380.00]  Intel revealed it will offer SSDs based on 3D NAND.
[5380.00 --> 5382.00]  This was posted by QWERTY Warrior on the forum.
[5382.00 --> 5384.00]  The original article is from Tech Report.
[5384.00 --> 5385.00]  Look at that.
[5385.00 --> 5387.00]  We're posting all the articles from our buddies in the last couple minutes here.
[5387.00 --> 5389.00]  We got Scott from Tech Report.
[5389.00 --> 5390.00]  Ryan from PC.
[5390.00 --> 5392.00]  Well, mind you, Ryan's not my buddy.
[5392.00 --> 5393.00]  I kind of hate that guy.
[5393.00 --> 5394.00]  Whoa.
[5394.00 --> 5395.00]  Even more shots fired.
[5395.00 --> 5396.00]  Yeah.
[5396.00 --> 5397.00]  I'm just kidding, Ryan, if you're watching this.
[5397.00 --> 5398.00]  I know you're not.
[5398.00 --> 5401.00]  You don't watch cool programming like Wancho.
[5402.00 --> 5405.00]  Too busy watching the PC per podcast.
[5405.00 --> 5406.00]  Oh.
[5406.00 --> 5407.00]  Too many P's in that.
[5407.00 --> 5408.00]  That's why it will never succeed.
[5408.00 --> 5410.00]  Well, triple rect, I guess.
[5410.00 --> 5411.00]  All right.
[5411.00 --> 5412.00]  So Intel 3D NAND.
[5412.00 --> 5416.00]  Intel revealed it will offer SSDs in the second half of next year based on 3D NAND.
[5416.00 --> 5419.00]  It is a result of Intel's joint flash venture with Micron.
[5419.00 --> 5427.00]  It stacks 32 planar levels to deliver 256 gigabits, so 32 gigabytes of storage in a single MLC die.
[5427.00 --> 5439.00]  And the 3D NAND can also be packed with 3 bits per cell to hit up to 384 gigabit or 48 gigabytes per die.
[5439.00 --> 5444.00]  The 3D NAND will enable 10 gig SSDs within the next couple of years.
[5444.00 --> 5445.00]  Uh, 10 terabyte.
[5445.00 --> 5446.00]  I'm sorry?
[5446.00 --> 5447.00]  10 terabyte.
[5447.00 --> 5448.00]  Yeah, that's what I meant to say.
[5448.00 --> 5449.00]  Thank you.
[5449.00 --> 5450.00]  10 terabyte SSD.
[5450.00 --> 5452.00]  Yeah, 10 gig SSDs would be less impressive.
[5452.00 --> 5456.00]  I, again, like I said, I was working before the show, so I didn't get to see a lot of the docs.
[5456.00 --> 5459.00]  So when you first said this, I was like, yeah, not surprising.
[5459.00 --> 5462.00]  But it's cool to be able to see some, like, the specs and the time frame.
[5462.00 --> 5465.00]  I don't think costs are gonna, you know, plummet immediately.
[5465.00 --> 5468.00]  You know, you look at Samsung, they've got 3D NAND.
[5468.00 --> 5478.00]  The actual cost per gigabyte right now is not that much lower, but give it a little bit of time and we could see SSDs much more competitive with hard drives.
[5478.00 --> 5479.00]  That would be awesome.
[5479.00 --> 5487.00]  So remember guys, the benefits of 3D NAND are that they don't have to use quite the same crazy advanced process node technology
[5487.00 --> 5491.00]  so they can actually use less sophisticated fabs, potentially.
[5491.00 --> 5495.00]  Also, better reliability because they're using larger processes.
[5495.00 --> 5498.00]  Better speed because of using a larger manufacturing process.
[5498.00 --> 5502.00]  So cool stuff all around.
[5502.00 --> 5506.00]  Everyone in the chat was all like, oh my god, 10 gig SSD.
[5506.00 --> 5507.00]  Not yet.
[5507.00 --> 5508.00]  Not yet.
[5508.00 --> 5509.00]  Sorry guys.
[5509.00 --> 5512.00]  I got everyone's panties all wet and I'm not even gonna do anything about it.
[5512.00 --> 5513.00]  All right.
[5513.00 --> 5515.00]  New York Times Square.
[5515.00 --> 5530.00]  New Times Square Digital Billboard is 100 meters across and 8 stories tall, has 24 million pixels, and is powered by 3 AMD Fire Pro W9000 GPUs.
[5530.00 --> 5537.00]  This is posted on fireuser.com and, or posted on the forum by A-A Ming and the original article is from fireuser.com.
[5537.00 --> 5540.00]  I'm gonna go ahead and post that in here, you guys.
[5540.00 --> 5549.00]  Wow, today I posted all the links in the chat, but I completely forgot about just bringing stuff up on my screen and screen sharing.
[5549.00 --> 5552.00]  So it's like, one of these days I'm gonna learn to do both.
[5552.00 --> 5554.00]  So here's the article from fireuser.com.
[5554.00 --> 5556.00]  It looks amazing.
[5556.00 --> 5557.00]  24 megapixels.
[5557.00 --> 5560.00]  This is the highest resolution display in the world, I believe.
[5560.00 --> 5562.00]  That's actually insane.
[5562.00 --> 5563.00]  Yeah.
[5563.00 --> 5565.00]  Three, that's such a beast machine.
[5565.00 --> 5570.00]  It'll be really exciting to see the massive error message whenever that happens.
[5570.00 --> 5574.00]  Well, actually there might be higher resolution displays, but certainly nothing this big.
[5574.00 --> 5575.00]  Yeah.
[5575.00 --> 5576.00]  Yeah.
[5576.00 --> 5578.00]  And that page isn't loading anyway, so apparently it was never meant to be.
[5578.00 --> 5583.00]  So like, when the page can't load on that screen, it'll just be freaking huge.
[5583.00 --> 5584.00]  That's my favorite thing.
[5584.00 --> 5586.00]  You guys probably all hit that page.
[5586.00 --> 5588.00]  That's why I can't load it.
[5588.00 --> 5589.00]  Correct.
[5589.00 --> 5590.00]  That's actually probably it.
[5590.00 --> 5593.00]  I love seeing error messages on public machines.
[5593.00 --> 5594.00]  Me too.
[5594.00 --> 5595.00]  I don't know why.
[5595.00 --> 5604.00]  Whenever you see like, I remember when I used to go to BCIT, they'd had these like, tall, very tall, like, uh, landscape?
[5604.00 --> 5605.00]  Why am I thinking this?
[5605.00 --> 5606.00]  Portrait?
[5606.00 --> 5607.00]  Portrait?
[5607.00 --> 5608.00]  Yeah, portrait.
[5608.00 --> 5609.00]  I don't know why I couldn't think of that properly.
[5609.00 --> 5611.00]  You have a landscape that's kind of this way.
[5611.00 --> 5612.00]  Yeah.
[5612.00 --> 5613.00]  Just hold your head like this.
[5613.00 --> 5618.00]  It could be like if there's mountains on each side and you're looking in between them.
[5618.00 --> 5620.00]  Anyways, don't worry about it.
[5620.00 --> 5624.00]  Um, yeah, portrait mode monitors that would like show you a map of the school and stuff.
[5624.00 --> 5626.00]  And when they blue screened, it was hilarious.
[5626.00 --> 5630.00]  This is a giant, super tall portrait blue screen.
[5630.00 --> 5632.00]  It's like, oh, thank you.
[5632.00 --> 5633.00]  Awesome.
[5633.00 --> 5634.00]  Super helpful.
[5634.00 --> 5640.00]  Speaking of super tall, our last topic, and this actually is a legitimate segue, is ISO.
[5640.00 --> 5641.00]  I always say it wrong.
[5641.00 --> 5642.00]  I always say it ISO.
[5642.00 --> 5643.00]  That's how it's pronounced in English.
[5643.00 --> 5646.00]  If I look at it phonetically, I think there's a different way of saying it.
[5646.00 --> 5650.00]  Um, has revealed a new monitor with a one to one aspect ratio.
[5650.00 --> 5651.00]  Oh, okay.
[5651.00 --> 5653.00]  19-20 by 19-20 resolution.
[5653.00 --> 5654.00]  What?
[5654.00 --> 5655.00]  26 and a half inches.
[5655.00 --> 5661.00]  And they're saying, sort of the sales pitch here, this is a professional oriented monitor.
[5661.00 --> 5663.00]  It's convenient for longer content.
[5663.00 --> 5664.00]  Mm-hmm.
[5664.00 --> 5669.00]  Allows for a compromise between vertical and horizontal monitors.
[5669.00 --> 5670.00]  That it does.
[5670.00 --> 5675.00]  Uses an anti-lare IPS panel, professional glibber aid monitor, don't expect it to be cheap,
[5675.00 --> 5680.00]  available Q1 2015, and the least innovative thing ever.
[5680.00 --> 5681.00]  That's super weird.
[5681.00 --> 5686.00]  Because we already had five to four monitors 100 bazillion years ago.
[5686.00 --> 5688.00]  And everyone was like, nah.
[5688.00 --> 5689.00]  Let's go widescreen.
[5689.00 --> 5694.00]  So now it's an innovation to make it even more square than before.
[5694.00 --> 5695.00]  That's super weird.
[5695.00 --> 5699.00]  I don't think this is really gonna work out for them super well.
[5699.00 --> 5702.00]  Well, remember, they're relatively low volume.
[5702.00 --> 5708.00]  They're aiming at, like, professional applications where, yeah, the picture of it is like super
[5708.00 --> 5709.00]  goofball.
[5709.00 --> 5710.00]  It looks fake.
[5710.00 --> 5711.00]  And it looks super old, too.
[5711.00 --> 5712.00]  Yeah.
[5712.00 --> 5714.00]  It's pretty silly looking here.
[5714.00 --> 5716.00]  I'll screen share with you guys.
[5716.00 --> 5720.00]  So this is the Flexiscan EV2730Q.
[5720.00 --> 5721.00]  Oh.
[5721.00 --> 5724.00]  Apparently I'm on the wrong page.
[5724.00 --> 5725.00]  There we go.
[5725.00 --> 5726.00]  Looks a little something like that.
[5726.00 --> 5728.00]  Like, it actually just, it looks just wrong.
[5728.00 --> 5729.00]  Yeah.
[5729.00 --> 5730.00]  That's so weird.
[5730.00 --> 5732.00]  1920 pixels by 1920 pixels.
[5732.00 --> 5735.00]  It's funny because you've never seen a square monitor before, probably.
[5735.00 --> 5739.00]  So, like, looking at one looks unnatural and weird.
[5739.00 --> 5741.00]  It's like there's something wrong with it.
[5741.00 --> 5745.00]  So 78% more pixels compared to full HD.
[5745.00 --> 5746.00]  Cool, man.
[5746.00 --> 5748.00]  Can I just have widescreen, please?
[5748.00 --> 5757.00]  You know, it's funny because, like, I was never much of an advocate for widescreen at
[5757.00 --> 5763.00]  the beginning when the affordable ones were 1440 by 900 and we didn't have enough vertical
[5763.00 --> 5764.00]  pixels.
[5764.00 --> 5766.00]  But then that problem goes away.
[5766.00 --> 5770.00]  As soon as you have enough vertical pixels on a Windows machine where scaling doesn't
[5770.00 --> 5771.00]  really work.
[5771.00 --> 5774.00]  So you just actually need more pixels to fit enough stuff on the screen.
[5774.00 --> 5779.00]  But as soon as that happened, as soon as we got 1200 vertical pixels, I was totally cool
[5779.00 --> 5780.00]  with widescreen.
[5780.00 --> 5785.00]  Then we moved back to 16 by 9 and then we didn't have enough vertical pixels again.
[5785.00 --> 5789.00]  And now, to compensate, we're going all the way back to 1 to 1 apparently.
[5789.00 --> 5791.00]  16 by 10 is still a great aspect ratio.
[5791.00 --> 5792.00]  I love 16 by 10.
[5792.00 --> 5794.00]  And I wish that there were more monitors that you could do.
[5794.00 --> 5795.00]  Me too.
[5795.00 --> 5796.00]  Huge fan of 16 by 10.
[5796.00 --> 5797.00]  That's kind of sad.
[5797.00 --> 5800.00]  Which is, I guess, all there is really to the WAN show today, isn't it?
[5800.00 --> 5801.00]  Yeah.
[5801.00 --> 5804.00]  There's a few other things, but I don't know if they're super important.
[5804.00 --> 5805.00]  You can do it if you want.
[5805.00 --> 5806.00]  Do what?
[5806.00 --> 5807.00]  I don't know.
[5807.00 --> 5808.00]  Other things you think are important?
[5808.00 --> 5809.00]  No, I said I don't know if there's something.
[5809.00 --> 5811.00]  There's that hydrogen car that's coming.
[5811.00 --> 5813.00]  That sounds super ball and cool.
[5813.00 --> 5814.00]  Yeah.
[5814.00 --> 5816.00]  I'm still more excited about...
[5816.00 --> 5817.00]  Oh, yeah, there's Elon Musk.
[5817.00 --> 5819.00]  Elon Musk is still worried about Terminator.
[5819.00 --> 5820.00]  Yeah.
[5820.00 --> 5821.00]  AI and badness.
[5821.00 --> 5823.00]  I think he's talked about that before.
[5823.00 --> 5825.00]  Yeah, we've talked about him talking about that before.
[5825.00 --> 5826.00]  Yeah.
[5826.00 --> 5827.00]  So he's just...
[5827.00 --> 5828.00]  Okay.
[5828.00 --> 5829.00]  Continuing his conversation.
[5829.00 --> 5830.00]  Well, on that high energy note...
[5830.00 --> 5831.00]  Yeah!
[5831.00 --> 5834.00]  Thanks for watching the WAN show.
[5834.00 --> 5835.00]  We'll see you guys again next week.
[5835.00 --> 5836.00]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[5836.00 --> 5839.00]  We'll be back on the After Party for more talk about the fundraiser right now.
[5839.00 --> 5840.00]  Let's do it!
[5840.00 --> 5841.00]  Yeah!
[5841.00 --> 5842.00]  Thank you.
[5842.00 --> 5843.00]  Energy!
[5843.00 --> 5844.00]  5-4!
[5844.00 --> 5845.00]  Swamp Butt!
[5845.00 --> 5846.00]  5-4!
[5846.00 --> 5847.00]  Linda!
[5847.00 --> 5848.00]  5-4!
[5848.00 --> 5849.00]  Swamp!
[5849.00 --> 5850.00]  Couch!
[5850.00 --> 5851.00]  Linda!
[5851.00 --> 5852.00]  Couch!
[5852.00 --> 5853.00]  5-4!
[5853.00 --> 5854.00]  Land!
[5854.00 --> 5855.00]  Land!
[5855.00 --> 5856.00]  Energy!
[5856.00 --> 5858.00]  Power thirst!
[5858.00 --> 5859.00]  Yeah!
[5859.00 --> 5860.00]  Power thirst!
[5860.00 --> 5861.00]  Does anyone remember that?
[5861.00 --> 5862.00]  I don't know.
[5862.00 --> 5863.00]  I don't know.
