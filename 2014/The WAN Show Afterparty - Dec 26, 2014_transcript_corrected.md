[0.00 → 2.00] responding oh
[6.00 → 8.00] I see ah
[8.10 → 10.10] tablet multitasking for the not win
[10.60 → 14.72] Yeah, all right. Hold on. I just got to pull down the're live tweets and everything
[14.72 → 17.96] Yeah, I always forget to do that, and then I get all these people
[20.52 → 22.52] Yeah, sorry, sorry
[23.22 → 28.70] My favourite thing ever was when I did I can't after party tonight by the way guys I have more Christmas stuffs to do
[28.70 → 30.70] I'm sorry
[31.64 → 35.50] But I can't do my after party I guess this one's going to be really short
[36.20 → 38.56] But I did an after party for Far Cry 4
[38.76 → 46.38] Then I did the alternate ending which was like a huge amount of standing in one spot and then essentially a short cinematic and then the game ends
[47.94 → 51.42] And then I was like, okay cool done and then just close the whole stream
[51.88 → 57.46] That's terrible. I came back later. Furthermore, I'd like completely shut down the whole stream everyone's like
[58.70 → 65.96] I essentially stood in one spot for 15 minutes watched like a two-minute-long cinematic, and then it just closed the whole stream
[65.96 → 69.16] You're terrible. That was awesome
[69.16 → 76.46] I um, I'm kind of excited. I kind of want to stream this weekend just so that I can try out the razor siren mic
[76.46 → 82.22] But they've sent me two of them so far and neither of them works on my desktop for some reason
[82.22 → 86.92] It just says this device cannot start. I pulled one of them into the office today plugged it into the Mac
[87.88 → 91.10] Worked instantly, so I'm not sure what the deal is
[91.10 → 94.40] I haven't heard back from them today because it's like holiday week and stuff
[94.40 → 99.64] But we actually had a new peak viewer count today. Did we yeah? Wow. We passed 7k
[99.64 → 105.70] Wow, that's incredible. That was pretty sweet, and we covered like two news topics. I know
[107.06 → 112.30] Well, there wasn't a lot to talk about. It is a cool show regardless. I think I thought it was alright. Yeah
[113.08 → 115.24] Apparently other people did too. It's just kind of funny
[116.84 → 120.14] I like these loot crate sponsor spots. They're fun. They are fun
[120.14 → 124.88] We get to open the thing. I feel like we do them for way too long, but like I don't know. I'm having fun
[124.88 → 129.08] Yeah, and I want to pull everything out and no one really seems to like oh my god
[129.08 → 133.60] That's not how you're supposed to use it is it I guess you claimed it now. I only touched it with my teeth
[133.60 → 137.50] There's actually very little saliva. Ha ha you didn't say there's no saliva
[138.28 → 140.28] Very little well, we could give it to Nick
[142.32 → 146.42] Alright that works. I mean what's a better way of like marking your territory
[146.42 → 151.84] Is it marking your territory and making sure everyone knows you marked it or marking your territory and then letting them use it
[154.88 → 160.64] I don't know I think in theory making sure that everyone knows but if you wanted to troll
[162.02 → 168.38] Instead of like actually marking it so that other people don't have it if you want to just troll then yeah, I think you're fine, right?
[170.30 → 176.38] I'm tired. Yeah, me too. I feel I have a sore throat though. I'm pretty sure I'm getting sick. Oh, really? Yeah
[176.72 → 181.26] Don't get sick for CES dude. Well better to get sick before CES than at CES
[181.26 → 188.48] Well, yeah, oh my god. That was so much peanut butter on my hand. That was disgusting. That was insane
[191.68 → 197.72] So for the new office should we try to queue up content before we move into it or should we just like
[198.32 → 202.24] Dedicate two of our people to shooting and editing like a live
[203.54 → 205.54] moving blog and
[205.54 → 210.54] And just do that for a week. I guess we could ask people I don't like the mean
[210.54 → 212.12] I don't mind the moving blog idea
[212.12 → 216.14] But I think what we could almost do is like queue up a little bit of content and then weave it
[217.06 → 224.64] Hmm so have like moving blog content moving blog content moving blog content right, so every movie blog is like two days of moving
[224.78 → 229.96] Kind of thing instead of just one day of moving I think enough entertaining stuff would happen in one day of moving
[229.96 → 235.80] I didn't mean it because of that I meant it for the people that might not care about moving blog
[236.12 → 238.12] Right they get more normal content
[239.08 → 246.20] Might also be fine. I don't know another thing that we should, we could do unboxing we could weave in unboxing
[246.40 → 251.16] Yeah, I was actually just going to say like I was actually kind of thinking for next year people some people
[251.72 → 258.24] Really like the unboxing some people don't, but I was thinking maybe we could do like one unboxing day a week next year or something like that
[258.24 → 263.74] Like Monday's unboxing day. Yeah, we're like unboxing Saturdays or something like that
[264.52 → 269.18] But like we could figure out what's our worst day of the week or something like that
[269.18 → 273.96] And we could do the unboxing there so that way the people who are like really hardcore and want to watch it can watch it
[273.96 → 280.26] And watch it but the people who sort of have their own schedule that doesn't revolve around when we release content
[280.68 → 283.76] We can save the higher production value stuff for that. That'd be cool
[283.76 → 286.22] I like that idea to putting it on the low traffic day
[286.22 → 291.28] The problem is we have such a hard time figuring out what our low traffic days are because these people keep watching
[291.28 → 293.04] Yeah, they keep increasing our max
[293.04 → 298.30] Well, I expected the video that I uploaded on Christmas Eve night to just tank
[298.98 → 300.18] Right
[300.18 → 307.24] But that video which is our 4k gaming system like value gaming system build log
[308.00 → 310.00] has
[310.00 → 313.00] Right the apps better it doesn't make any sense
[313.00 → 315.06] 260,000 views
[315.06 → 315.56] Yes
[315.56 → 320.04] Like people watch the crap out of that on Christmas Day
[320.04 → 326.64] I was at okay. This might sound a little bit weird, but I was at a like house party thing for
[327.74 → 332.60] Christmas with like some friends that I went to high school with and one of the guys put a
[332.60 → 340.98] Linus Tech Tips build log video that went up that day on the TV through Chromecast, and it was the most awkward thing
[342.98 → 345.50] They knew who you were right? Oh, good
[346.58 → 348.58] I'm just sitting there. I'm just like
[348.58 → 353.64] With all the in your endo jokes?
[353.64 → 354.64] Yeah, pretty much
[354.64 → 356.64] Yeah, were your parents there?
[356.64 → 357.64] No
[357.64 → 358.64] Oh good, so this was just friends
[358.64 → 359.14] Yeah
[359.14 → 360.14] Okay, that's cool
[360.14 → 360.64] Yeah
[360.64 → 361.14] Yeah
[361.14 → 364.64] If my parents were there it would have been my parents doing that
[364.64 → 365.64] Right
[365.64 → 366.64] They do that
[366.64 → 370.76] They'll have like relatives over, and they're like, alright, time to watch like
[370.76 → 372.92] LDT videos
[372.92 → 376.88] That's so weird like my family has zero interest in what I do
[376.88 → 377.46] Right
[377.46 → 378.58] Like nothing
[378.58 → 382.66] Like I think about the extent of
[382.66 → 386.72] About the extent of their involvement
[386.72 → 394.46] I think about the extent of their involvement in my show is like
[394.46 → 397.88] They know that I make YouTube videos
[397.88 → 399.14] They know what YouTube is
[399.14 → 401.44] I think my dad has watched a couple of my videos
[401.44 → 406.96] Meanwhile, there's my parents who have both seen every single video on LysetecDipsTechQuickie and Superfan
[406.96 → 410.74] A lot of times separately because they won't have time to watch it together
[410.74 → 413.12] That is so funny
[413.12 → 416.46] Mr. Wizard said thank you for the shout-out
[416.46 → 418.30] No, thank you, Mr. Wizard
[418.30 → 422.36] The forum doesn't run without the administration staff
[422.36 → 425.82] And if your admin is under your name on the forum
[425.82 → 428.14] Then you're either an administration staff or you're Nick
[428.14 → 429.22] Or Linus
[429.22 → 430.02] Or your administration
[430.02 → 432.28] Wow
[432.28 → 434.34] Jock's fired
[434.34 → 436.64] What have you done to admin the forum?
[436.70 → 440.66] I monitor the messages sometimes inbox
[440.66 → 443.32] Right, that's true
[443.32 → 445.66] That is an administrative function
[445.66 → 448.70] A lot of it's like junk and sales though
[448.70 → 451.00] Yes, and I ignore that
[451.00 → 453.08] And I just leave it in the inbox
[453.08 → 457.44] I know, which means that there's like 200 pending messages all the time
[457.44 → 459.50] Well honestly, I leave a lot of stuff in there
[459.50 → 461.82] Just because it's like I don't have
[461.82 → 464.24] Like I never really have time to sit down and deal with it
[464.24 → 466.06] And it's a very inefficient messaging system
[466.06 → 466.88] It is, it's really
[466.88 → 468.76] So, but like I feel bad
[468.76 → 470.34] But some of that stuff is just like
[470.34 → 472.10] Why are people messaging me through here?
[472.10 → 474.08] Like I had someone message me today
[474.08 → 474.36] I don't know how difficult to do it
[474.36 → 476.48] Through linusmediagroup.com
[476.48 → 477.48] Asking me
[477.48 → 479.16] And I don't mean to call this person out
[479.16 → 480.00] But just like
[480.00 → 481.90] Sometimes I kind of shake my head
[481.90 → 482.94] Because the message is
[482.94 → 487.32] Yeah, there's this really cool Corsair case
[487.32 → 489.54] And I think it's the 380T or 2
[489.54 → 490.14] Air 240
[490.14 → 490.76] Air 240
[490.76 → 492.52] It's a really cool Corsair case
[492.52 → 494.78] And I can't find any reviews of it online
[494.78 → 495.98] Can you do a video about it?
[496.66 → 497.26] And I'm just like
[497.26 → 497.88] Don't we have one?
[498.76 → 499.46] Yeah, we do
[499.46 → 501.60] So I go on YouTube
[501.60 → 502.98] And I type in
[502.98 → 503.90] Air 240
[503.90 → 506.82] Our video is literally the first hit
[506.82 → 508.42] And it's just like
[508.42 → 509.22] And I'm not gonna
[509.22 → 510.12] I'm not going to send them
[510.12 → 511.12] And let me Google that for you
[511.12 → 511.52] Like it's
[511.52 → 513.10] Like I'm not going to be like that about it
[513.10 → 514.22] So I'll just link them in the video
[514.22 → 516.20] But it's like
[516.20 → 517.42] It's the first hit
[517.42 → 518.84] How hard could you have looked?
[519.34 → 519.60] And it's
[519.60 → 520.80] But the thing is
[520.80 → 521.74] Is that it's not like the guy
[521.74 → 522.92] Didn't put any effort into it
[522.92 → 524.22] He managed to go all the way
[524.22 → 525.58] To linusmediagroup.com
[525.58 → 526.70] Which nobody uses
[526.70 → 527.00] No
[527.00 → 528.64] Find the contact us form
[528.64 → 529.98] Which nobody uses
[529.98 → 530.48] Yeah
[530.48 → 532.44] And send an email about it
[532.44 → 534.02] And like that was so much more work
[534.02 → 535.44] Than just searching for it
[535.44 → 536.64] On YouTube in the first place
[536.64 → 538.48] Misdirected effort
[538.48 → 539.60] This is why I think
[539.60 → 541.36] That video that no one agrees with me
[541.36 → 541.90] Is important
[541.90 → 543.58] Including everyone else that I've asked
[543.58 → 544.94] Not even just linusmediagroup
[544.94 → 546.80] But just the Google food video
[546.80 → 547.86] Right
[547.86 → 550.00] Yeah, maybe we should do it
[550.00 → 551.34] No one thinks it's important
[551.34 → 552.48] It probably won't do that well
[552.48 → 553.34] But I just
[553.34 → 554.46] I know there's people out there
[554.46 → 554.94] That need it
[554.94 → 555.42] People get slammed
[555.42 → 556.60] Just for doing that video
[556.60 → 557.02] I know, I know
[557.02 → 558.46] Like I know
[558.46 → 559.90] Okay
[559.90 → 560.98] The problem
[560.98 → 562.44] Is its one of those things
[562.44 → 563.90] Where the people it would help
[563.90 → 565.42] It will never reach
[565.42 → 565.84] Yeah
[565.84 → 566.44] No, I know
[566.44 → 567.74] And that's a huge part of the problem
[567.74 → 568.80] But like I know
[568.80 → 569.72] A lot of people need it
[569.72 → 571.10] But there's also a huge amount of people
[571.10 → 572.36] That it's just a waste of time for
[572.36 → 573.20] Because they're fine
[573.20 → 574.34] And it's not going to help them
[574.34 → 575.50] I just
[575.50 → 576.12] There's
[576.12 → 577.16] There's people out there
[577.16 → 578.62] That just don't have the Google food
[578.62 → 580.60] Yeah
[580.60 → 582.10] Yeah
[582.10 → 583.20] I think it's a life skill
[583.20 → 584.18] I think it should be like
[584.18 → 584.68] It is now
[584.68 → 584.74] It is now
[584.74 → 585.28] In class
[585.28 → 585.70] Yeah
[585.70 → 587.32] Like what was it
[587.32 → 588.18] Finland
[588.18 → 590.42] That was doing the typing courses
[590.42 → 590.82] And whatnot
[590.82 → 591.60] Coding, yeah
[591.60 → 592.64] Coding?
[592.88 → 593.90] Yeah, they do coding now
[593.90 → 595.20] I think
[595.20 → 596.04] No, they replaced
[596.04 → 597.66] Oh, cursive
[597.66 → 599.30] With typing, yeah
[599.30 → 600.28] Typing and what we thought
[600.28 → 601.06] Was phone texting
[601.06 → 601.78] But it's actually
[601.78 → 602.72] Printing
[602.72 → 603.32] Printing, yeah
[603.32 → 603.88] Which they thought
[603.88 → 604.80] We were joking about
[604.80 → 606.10] And then I messaged someone
[606.10 → 607.14] Telling me that we call it
[607.14 → 607.78] Printing here
[607.78 → 608.14] Haha
[608.14 → 609.54] Because printing is like
[609.54 → 610.36] A printer printing
[610.36 → 611.22] But we also
[611.22 → 613.50] We call block letters printing
[613.50 → 614.88] And then they were really confused
[614.88 → 615.42] Yeah
[615.42 → 616.48] It's just like
[616.48 → 616.82] Okay
[616.82 → 617.96] What we have here
[617.96 → 619.00] Is a failure to communicate
[619.00 → 619.30] Yeah
[619.30 → 619.68] That's fine
[619.68 → 622.08] But yeah
[622.08 → 623.58] They should almost introduce it
[623.58 → 624.26] Into that class
[624.26 → 624.96] It should just be like
[624.96 → 625.76] Modern skills
[625.76 → 628.26] While we're marvelling
[628.26 → 629.02] At just like
[629.02 → 630.82] Crazy Shaw
[630.82 → 631.86] For this year
[631.86 → 633.26] Here's our
[633.26 → 635.20] Here's our viewership graph
[635.20 → 635.98] For this year
[635.98 → 637.44] This is just crazy
[637.44 → 639.18] My favourite thing
[639.18 → 639.66] Was the
[639.66 → 640.74] Twitch chat explosion
[640.74 → 641.28] When it saw
[641.28 → 642.32] The estimated earnings
[642.32 → 643.34] And like
[643.34 → 644.20] You guys forget
[644.20 → 645.42] That all of you guys
[645.42 → 646.32] Are running ad block
[646.32 → 646.80] Haha
[646.80 → 649.48] Like all of you
[649.48 → 649.96] Basically
[649.96 → 651.04] As far as I can tell
[651.04 → 652.38] Yeah
[652.38 → 654.36] And the estimated earnings
[654.36 → 654.88] Are like
[654.88 → 657.26] A pretty broad range there
[657.26 → 657.72] Yeah
[657.72 → 658.54] But yeah
[658.54 → 659.26] Check this out
[659.26 → 660.84] So this is CES
[660.84 → 662.36] You can always see CES
[662.36 → 662.84] On the
[662.84 → 665.44] There's a pretty gigantic blip
[665.44 → 665.82] Yes
[665.82 → 666.76] And then it was like
[666.76 → 667.24] Flat
[667.24 → 667.42] Flat
[667.42 → 667.58] Flat
[667.58 → 667.66] Flat
[667.66 → 668.02] Flat
[668.02 → 668.06] Flat
[668.06 → 668.16] Flat
[668.16 → 668.42] Flat
[668.42 → 668.76] Flat
[668.76 → 669.42] So my goal
[669.42 → 670.64] Coming into this year
[670.64 → 672.78] Was 200,000 views a day
[672.78 → 673.84] Average
[673.84 → 676.32] And we were kind of like
[676.32 → 676.92] Getting there
[676.92 → 677.26] Getting there
[677.26 → 677.64] Getting there
[677.64 → 678.02] Getting there
[678.02 → 678.62] Getting there
[678.62 → 679.10] Oh
[679.10 → 679.36] Oh
[679.36 → 680.64] We kind of held it for a bit
[680.64 → 683.32] No
[683.32 → 683.64] No
[683.64 → 684.24] Oh crap
[684.24 → 685.12] It kind of fell apart
[685.12 → 685.60] Getting there
[685.60 → 685.96] Getting there
[685.96 → 687.20] And then something
[687.20 → 688.28] Happened in June
[688.28 → 689.20] And I don't know
[689.20 → 689.66] If it's something
[689.66 → 690.54] That our viewers
[690.54 → 691.50] Started doing differently
[691.50 → 692.40] Or something that
[692.40 → 693.52] We started doing differently
[693.52 → 695.04] But we went from
[695.04 → 696.24] Not getting it
[696.24 → 697.06] To
[697.06 → 698.24] Beginning of June
[698.24 → 699.16] End of May
[699.16 → 701.74] And I don't think
[701.74 → 702.60] We fell below
[702.60 → 703.46] 200,000
[703.46 → 704.32] For the entire rest
[704.32 → 704.72] Of the year
[704.72 → 706.14] And then
[706.14 → 707.38] And now
[707.38 → 709.24] Now
[709.24 → 710.18] We're tracking
[710.18 → 711.70] Like 400
[711.70 → 713.08] 450,000
[713.08 → 713.56] Average
[713.56 → 713.96] A day
[713.96 → 714.74] Just nuts
[714.74 → 716.26] And that's our new peak
[716.26 → 717.80] 610,000 views
[717.80 → 718.52] I'm excited to see
[718.52 → 719.32] The CES peak
[719.32 → 719.84] From this year
[719.84 → 720.90] Yeah
[720.90 → 722.12] It might be kind of bananas
[722.12 → 722.64] I know it
[722.64 → 724.24] Heavily depends on products
[724.24 → 725.02] Yeah
[725.02 → 726.00] And like
[726.00 → 726.34] Honestly
[726.34 → 726.92] I don't really know
[726.92 → 728.12] What to expect right now
[728.12 → 728.48] Yeah
[728.48 → 729.18] I don't know
[729.18 → 729.64] How hopeful
[729.64 → 730.14] It's looking
[730.14 → 730.98] CES this year
[730.98 → 732.12] Looks a little dry
[732.12 → 732.58] But
[732.58 → 733.62] More curved TVs
[733.62 → 734.38] We will cover
[734.38 → 735.66] All the interesting things
[735.66 → 736.00] Yeah
[736.00 → 737.34] And some boring stuff too
[737.34 → 738.44] And some boring stuff
[738.44 → 739.70] Yeah
[739.70 → 740.56] Let me try a different
[740.56 → 741.92] The Phantom Glass video
[741.92 → 742.68] Is going to be really cool
[742.68 → 743.42] That's going to be fun
[743.42 → 745.90] I'm looking forward to that one
[745.90 → 746.40] Oh
[746.40 → 747.48] Well I zoomed in
[747.48 → 748.28] That might be the problem
[748.28 → 750.88] And something else
[750.88 → 752.14] That people have to bear in mind
[752.14 → 753.38] About our operation
[753.38 → 754.08] In particular
[754.08 → 755.38] When they see things like
[755.38 → 756.24] Estimated earnings
[756.24 → 757.66] Is that
[757.66 → 758.90] We have seven people
[758.90 → 759.38] Working here
[759.38 → 760.10] Mm-hmm
[760.10 → 761.04] So like
[761.04 → 762.70] Anything you see
[762.70 → 763.60] Divided by seven
[763.60 → 764.70] Factor in that
[764.70 → 765.46] I'm probably keeping
[765.46 → 766.34] 90% of it
[766.34 → 767.52] And there you go
[767.52 → 769.24] How will he survive
[769.24 → 773.48] I don't keep 90% of it
[773.48 → 775.18] There's not
[775.18 → 776.04] There's not enough
[776.04 → 777.70] For me to keep 90% of it
[777.70 → 778.06] No
[778.06 → 779.28] And have the company survive
[779.28 → 779.90] And like
[779.90 → 780.24] This is
[780.24 → 781.32] This is kind of crazy too
[781.32 → 782.18] So if you go back
[782.18 → 783.10] Two years
[783.10 → 784.88] So here's
[784.88 → 785.96] So here's the
[785.96 → 786.30] The
[786.30 → 787.24] Where it turns over
[787.24 → 788.26] So here's where my goal
[788.26 → 788.62] Was like
[788.62 → 788.96] Oh yeah
[788.96 → 789.66] So you can see
[789.66 → 790.54] At the end of last year
[790.54 → 791.56] That's where I got the idea
[791.56 → 792.46] That maybe we could do
[792.46 → 793.62] 200,000 views a day
[793.62 → 793.86] Right
[793.86 → 794.74] And I was like
[794.74 → 794.96] Yeah
[794.96 → 795.84] That should be our goal
[795.84 → 796.36] For this year
[796.36 → 797.40] So if you go back
[797.40 → 798.16] The previous year
[798.16 → 799.92] We didn't grow nearly as much
[799.92 → 801.22] Like here's the CES bump
[801.22 → 802.34] That actually stood
[802.34 → 803.18] As our
[803.18 → 804.64] All-time highest
[804.64 → 805.36] Single day
[805.36 → 807.58] For almost two years
[807.58 → 808.66] Until we beat it
[808.66 → 808.86] On November 30th
[808.86 → 808.98] Again
[808.98 → 809.72] Product focus
[809.72 → 810.02] Right
[810.02 → 811.06] Like it really matters
[811.06 → 812.04] What gets shown there
[812.04 → 812.18] Yeah
[812.18 → 812.62] And we did like
[812.62 → 813.70] 20 videos that day
[813.70 → 814.18] Mm-hmm
[814.18 → 815.22] And before we like
[815.22 → 816.34] Cooled it a little bit
[816.34 → 818.30] But that
[818.30 → 819.96] That previous year
[819.96 → 820.62] We did like
[820.62 → 822.74] 130, 120
[822.74 → 823.84] Throughout the year
[823.84 → 824.92] Then we grew
[824.92 → 826.50] Kind of at the end of the year
[826.50 → 827.42] A little bit
[827.42 → 828.88] Quite a lot actually
[828.88 → 830.58] But it didn't hold
[830.58 → 831.88] The way that this has
[831.88 → 834.34] That trend is amazing
[834.34 → 835.78] That just means that
[835.78 → 837.00] You guys care
[837.00 → 837.62] Or something
[837.62 → 838.20] Yeah
[838.20 → 839.62] Like all the
[839.62 → 840.38] All the cares
[840.38 → 841.38] All the cares
[841.38 → 842.44] Like the first half of this year
[842.44 → 843.40] It didn't really look like
[843.40 → 845.00] We were going to do that much better
[845.00 → 845.82] Than the previous year
[845.82 → 846.74] To be perfectly honest
[846.74 → 847.52] Like here
[847.52 → 848.34] We can have a look
[848.34 → 849.38] At
[849.38 → 850.38] At what we did
[850.38 → 851.06] The previous year
[851.06 → 851.88] So that was
[851.88 → 854.50] So that was
[854.50 → 856.24] 57,000
[856.24 → 857.82] Or 57 million views
[857.82 → 858.80] And then what would
[858.80 → 859.82] 200,000 times
[859.82 → 861.00] 365 be
[861.00 → 862.04] That's not even
[862.04 → 862.80] That much more
[862.80 → 863.30] That would be what
[863.30 → 864.22] Like 75 million
[864.22 → 866.48] 200,000 times
[866.48 → 869.48] I should probably
[869.48 → 870.26] Just calculate this
[870.26 → 871.22] I'm way too tired
[871.22 → 873.16] My dad would have
[873.16 → 873.82] Already been done
[873.82 → 875.30] I know
[875.30 → 876.10] But your dad's crazy
[876.10 → 877.42] Yep
[877.42 → 878.32] These bananas
[878.32 → 881.30] 730
[881.30 → 882.50] Oh 73 million
[882.50 → 883.36] Okay I was close
[883.36 → 885.86] So 73 million
[885.86 → 886.80] But what we actually
[886.80 → 887.62] Did this year
[887.62 → 890.52] So like it was
[890.52 → 891.24] Looking like we
[891.24 → 892.04] Weren't tracking that much
[892.04 → 892.76] What we actually did
[892.76 → 893.60] This year is like
[893.60 → 894.84] 100 million
[894.84 → 896.06] Over 100 million
[896.06 → 898.00] That's crazy
[898.00 → 899.44] So that's like
[899.44 → 900.42] Yeah
[900.42 → 901.40] 80%
[901.40 → 902.50] 80% growth
[902.50 → 902.82] Or something
[902.82 → 903.42] Along those lines
[903.42 → 905.54] Yeah it's been
[905.54 → 906.10] It's been a heck
[906.10 → 906.46] Of a year
[906.46 → 906.98] I wasn't
[906.98 → 907.82] I wasn't sure
[907.82 → 908.40] When we started
[908.40 → 908.96] This whole
[908.96 → 909.72] Linus Media Group
[909.72 → 910.22] Thing if it was
[910.22 → 910.56] Going to work
[910.56 → 910.98] And I had a lot
[910.98 → 911.54] Of people tell me
[911.54 → 912.24] It wasn't going to work
[912.24 → 913.62] Like especially
[913.62 → 914.40] When we first
[914.40 → 915.16] Started trying
[915.16 → 916.12] To do pre-rolls
[916.12 → 916.32] Or
[916.32 → 917.26] My favourite thing
[917.26 → 917.70] Sorry I'm going to
[917.70 → 917.96] Butt in
[917.96 → 918.92] My favourite thing
[918.92 → 919.66] Is people that I
[919.66 → 920.64] Like very clearly
[920.64 → 921.52] Remember having
[921.52 → 922.38] Conversations with
[922.38 → 923.06] That I mean
[923.06 → 923.68] It's like a horrible
[923.68 → 924.44] Idea, and it's not
[924.44 → 924.76] Going to work
[924.76 → 925.18] And all this kind of
[925.18 → 925.44] Stuff
[925.44 → 926.52] That now if I
[926.52 → 927.14] Bring up anything
[927.14 → 927.64] Like that
[927.64 → 927.92] They're like
[927.92 → 928.40] Yeah man
[928.40 → 929.14] Like I always knew
[929.14 → 930.04] It would be work
[930.04 → 930.44] And stuff
[930.44 → 930.76] I'm like
[930.76 → 931.44] Yeah okay
[931.44 → 932.54] Sure
[932.54 → 933.32] Sure dude
[933.32 → 935.12] I think your parents
[935.12 → 935.82] Were surprisingly
[935.82 → 937.20] Cool about it
[937.20 → 938.36] Not at first
[938.36 → 938.88] Considering
[938.88 → 940.92] Yeah but even at
[940.92 → 941.40] First they didn't
[941.40 → 943.12] Tell me not to do it
[943.12 → 946.04] I think they
[946.04 → 946.88] Advised you
[946.88 → 947.42] Not to do it
[947.42 → 948.44] Yeah but they
[948.44 → 948.94] Wouldn't be like
[948.94 → 949.64] No and they
[949.64 → 950.18] Were supportive
[950.18 → 950.60] And they would
[950.60 → 951.42] Help and whatnot
[951.42 → 952.52] Like they even
[952.52 → 953.16] Helped us move
[953.16 → 954.12] To the office
[954.12 → 954.60] We're currently
[954.60 → 955.30] By then I think
[955.30 → 955.88] They were mostly
[955.88 → 956.36] On board
[956.36 → 956.70] Yeah
[956.70 → 957.34] It was at the
[957.34 → 958.88] Beginning when
[958.88 → 959.78] I think your dad
[959.78 → 960.48] Expected me to
[960.48 → 961.02] Offer you like
[961.02 → 961.72] Minimum wage or
[961.72 → 962.44] Something like that
[962.44 → 963.24] Probably
[963.24 → 964.38] Based on what
[964.38 → 964.88] You were getting
[964.88 → 965.74] Paid before
[965.74 → 966.38] Helping me at
[966.38 → 966.86] MIX
[966.86 → 967.78] I can see where
[967.78 → 968.18] He might have
[968.18 → 968.86] Gotten the idea
[968.86 → 969.92] If I kept that
[969.92 → 970.80] Wage I would
[970.80 → 971.58] Be dead now
[971.58 → 973.06] I was only able
[973.06 → 973.96] To eat those
[973.96 → 975.16] Kimchi bowl things
[975.16 → 976.22] Well he was
[976.22 → 977.16] He was a contractor
[977.16 → 977.82] Right so there
[977.82 → 978.48] Was no
[978.48 → 979.50] It was like
[979.50 → 980.04] It was all
[980.04 → 980.46] It was all
[980.46 → 981.06] Piece work
[981.06 → 982.02] So it was like
[982.02 → 982.68] A flat rate
[982.68 → 983.28] Per video
[983.28 → 983.78] And like
[983.78 → 984.32] And then this
[984.32 → 984.80] Guy's like
[984.80 → 985.26] Yeah let's
[985.26 → 986.40] Constantly increase
[986.40 → 986.90] Our production
[986.90 → 987.48] Values
[987.48 → 988.38] So like
[988.38 → 988.76] But like
[988.76 → 989.08] My
[989.08 → 990.40] Per work
[990.40 → 991.14] Isn't going
[991.14 → 991.76] Up
[991.76 → 992.56] But the
[992.56 → 993.28] The amount
[993.28 → 993.80] Of time it
[993.80 → 994.12] Takes to
[994.12 → 994.68] Complete work
[994.68 → 995.00] Is going
[995.00 → 995.86] Like way
[995.86 → 996.88] Up
[996.88 → 997.40] It was an
[997.40 → 997.88] Investment
[997.88 → 998.70] It was an
[998.70 → 999.64] Important thing
[999.64 → 1000.36] For us to do
[1000.36 → 1001.22] I know it was
[1001.22 → 1002.02] It was an
[1002.02 → 1002.58] Important thing
[1002.58 → 1003.04] For us to do
[1003.04 → 1003.92] I think my
[1003.92 → 1004.74] Favourite is
[1004.74 → 1005.44] Some of the
[1005.44 → 1006.02] Like I don't even
[1006.02 → 1006.66] Remember any of
[1006.66 → 1007.08] Them anymore
[1007.08 → 1007.62] Because they've
[1007.62 → 1008.14] All completely
[1008.14 → 1008.72] Gone away
[1008.72 → 1009.64] But all the
[1009.64 → 1010.32] All the haters
[1010.32 → 1010.94] That would post
[1010.94 → 1011.48] On all of our
[1011.48 → 1011.86] Videos
[1011.86 → 1013.20] About how
[1013.20 → 1013.72] Linus
[1013.72 → 1014.58] Linus
[1014.58 → 1015.16] Media
[1015.16 → 1015.48] Garbage
[1015.48 → 1015.96] There was that
[1015.96 → 1017.14] One main guy
[1017.14 → 1017.76] Yeah there was
[1017.76 → 1018.52] Like that one guy
[1018.52 → 1018.88] I don't remember
[1018.88 → 1019.24] Who he was
[1019.24 → 1019.82] But like every
[1019.82 → 1020.80] Time was like
[1020.80 → 1021.74] And I hate that
[1021.74 → 1022.48] Slick guy
[1022.48 → 1023.26] Blah blah blah
[1023.26 → 1023.92] He's going to be
[1023.92 → 1024.78] Out on the street
[1024.78 → 1025.68] In six months
[1025.68 → 1026.60] Without a penny
[1026.60 → 1027.42] To his name
[1027.42 → 1029.68] And like I hate him
[1029.68 → 1030.82] And Linus Media
[1030.82 → 1031.46] Group is going to
[1031.46 → 1032.08] Shut down
[1032.08 → 1032.56] And you're going to
[1032.56 → 1033.22] Have to go back
[1033.22 → 1034.28] To your real job
[1034.28 → 1034.74] And I'm just like
[1034.74 → 1035.06] You know what
[1035.06 → 1036.04] This is a real job
[1036.04 → 1036.46] Actually
[1036.46 → 1036.94] Yeah
[1036.94 → 1037.70] I think we've
[1037.70 → 1038.62] Demonstrated at this
[1038.62 → 1039.64] Point that yeah
[1039.64 → 1040.46] This is a real job
[1040.46 → 1041.96] I usually bust my ass
[1041.96 → 1042.88] Pretty hard at most
[1042.88 → 1043.44] Jobs
[1043.44 → 1044.36] I probably work harder
[1044.36 → 1044.92] At this one
[1044.92 → 1045.76] Than any other one
[1045.76 → 1046.10] I have
[1046.10 → 1047.36] Yeah
[1047.36 → 1048.44] Me too
[1048.44 → 1048.82] But I mean
[1048.82 → 1049.42] That's the
[1049.42 → 1050.22] I mean that's what
[1050.22 → 1050.90] Being passionate about
[1050.90 → 1051.50] Something will do
[1051.50 → 1051.90] Yeah
[1051.90 → 1052.68] I mean it's
[1052.68 → 1053.28] I'm not complaining
[1053.28 → 1053.98] I'm just saying
[1053.98 → 1055.16] To be clear
[1055.16 → 1055.96] Like yeah
[1055.96 → 1056.72] We're not just
[1056.72 → 1057.42] Straight up in it
[1057.42 → 1057.84] For the money
[1057.84 → 1059.10] None of us are PewDiePie
[1059.10 → 1059.86] No
[1059.86 → 1060.52] We're not making
[1060.52 → 1061.48] Four million a year
[1061.48 → 1062.06] Or
[1062.06 → 1064.16] That's just stupid
[1064.16 → 1064.64] Yeah
[1064.64 → 1065.76] That's incredible
[1065.76 → 1066.46] Amounts of money
[1066.46 → 1067.54] But
[1067.54 → 1068.48] Yeah
[1068.48 → 1069.46] And in fact I think
[1069.46 → 1070.38] We're not
[1070.38 → 1071.38] We're not pulling a
[1071.38 → 1072.42] A notch
[1072.42 → 1073.12] And buying that
[1073.12 → 1074.58] 70 million dollar
[1074.58 → 1075.24] Mansion or whatever
[1075.24 → 1075.80] He's did
[1075.80 → 1077.20] I think every single
[1077.20 → 1077.80] Person here
[1077.80 → 1078.44] Could still make
[1078.44 → 1079.14] More somewhere else
[1079.14 → 1082.40] I still have offers
[1082.40 → 1082.84] For more
[1082.84 → 1083.76] In other places
[1083.76 → 1084.88] Yeah I could probably
[1084.88 → 1085.84] Walk back into my old
[1085.84 → 1086.52] Job tomorrow
[1086.52 → 1087.58] If I really felt like it
[1087.58 → 1089.18] Like yeah I'm back
[1089.18 → 1089.56] For good
[1089.56 → 1091.04] I want a desk
[1091.04 → 1091.96] With four monitors
[1091.96 → 1092.50] On it again
[1092.50 → 1093.76] The two most recent
[1093.76 → 1094.22] People
[1094.22 → 1095.94] Well one of them
[1095.94 → 1096.72] Could have not
[1096.72 → 1097.70] Left what he was doing
[1097.70 → 1099.00] And been making more
[1099.00 → 1099.42] Yeah
[1099.42 → 1099.94] And the other one
[1099.94 → 1100.58] Could have continued
[1100.58 → 1101.20] What they were doing
[1101.20 → 1101.76] And then eventually
[1101.76 → 1102.54] Been making more
[1102.54 → 1103.10] Yeah
[1103.10 → 1104.58] I don't know
[1104.58 → 1105.22] It's fun though
[1105.22 → 1105.92] I mean it's good
[1105.92 → 1107.08] Yeah and like
[1107.08 → 1107.40] What
[1107.40 → 1107.92] What
[1107.92 → 1108.84] The other
[1108.84 → 1109.18] I'm not
[1109.18 → 1110.04] Trying not to use names
[1110.04 → 1110.66] Because I don't know
[1110.66 → 1111.24] Yeah
[1111.24 → 1112.14] Like I don't know
[1112.14 → 1112.88] How much we should talk
[1112.88 → 1113.44] About people's
[1113.44 → 1114.82] Personal financial situations
[1114.82 → 1115.12] Yeah
[1115.12 → 1115.82] Probably not at all
[1115.82 → 1116.72] One of the
[1116.72 → 1118.28] Fairly recent ones
[1118.28 → 1119.20] When he was talking
[1119.20 → 1120.14] About how
[1120.14 → 1122.52] Like the happiness
[1122.52 → 1123.16] Level thing
[1123.16 → 1123.88] Yeah
[1123.88 → 1124.96] That's a huge deal
[1124.96 → 1125.64] Yeah
[1125.64 → 1126.08] And that's like
[1126.08 → 1127.62] A very well documented
[1127.62 → 1128.42] Huge deal
[1128.42 → 1129.50] Like how making more money
[1129.50 → 1130.62] Doesn't necessarily
[1130.62 → 1131.30] Yeah
[1131.30 → 1132.74] Pass a certain degree
[1132.74 → 1133.16] And like
[1133.16 → 1133.98] Well it's the
[1133.98 → 1135.00] Diminishing returns' thing
[1135.00 → 1136.12] So it doesn't just shut off
[1136.12 → 1136.96] But like you have to make
[1136.96 → 1138.90] Such astronomically more
[1138.90 → 1140.94] To get any real improvement
[1140.94 → 1141.54] In happiness
[1141.54 → 1142.66] That it just doesn't
[1142.66 → 1143.62] Really make a lot of sense
[1143.62 → 1144.50] And there's like
[1144.50 → 1145.84] Other things that should improve
[1145.84 → 1147.08] Like quality life improvements
[1147.08 → 1147.54] And stuff
[1147.54 → 1148.44] Well if you hate
[1148.44 → 1149.44] Your freaking job
[1149.44 → 1151.22] Minor quality life improvements
[1151.22 → 1152.38] Are probably not going to result
[1152.38 → 1153.10] In you no longer
[1153.10 → 1154.38] Hating your freaking job
[1154.38 → 1155.98] So I don't know
[1155.98 → 1157.34] I think there's value in that
[1157.34 → 1158.44] Aw we've got someone
[1158.44 → 1159.60] Saying this is getting depressing
[1159.60 → 1160.74] We're not meaning to be depressing
[1160.74 → 1161.50] We love our jobs
[1161.50 → 1162.90] That's the point
[1162.90 → 1163.56] Yeah we have to
[1163.56 → 1164.44] Work really hard
[1164.44 → 1165.12] And bust our butts
[1165.12 → 1166.08] And that's fine
[1166.08 → 1167.06] But the
[1167.06 → 1168.46] Yeah the moral of the story
[1168.46 → 1169.12] Is when you wake up
[1169.12 → 1169.46] In the morning
[1169.46 → 1170.40] And want to go to work
[1170.40 → 1171.14] Busting your butt
[1171.14 → 1172.00] And working extra hours
[1172.00 → 1172.64] Don't really matter
[1172.64 → 1174.76] Like I'll come home
[1174.76 → 1175.72] And then be like
[1175.72 → 1177.30] Oh time to relax
[1177.30 → 1178.10] Time to
[1178.10 → 1179.60] Answer messages
[1179.60 → 1180.22] On the forum
[1180.22 → 1181.10] Trying to help people
[1181.10 → 1182.74] With like broken account problems
[1182.74 → 1183.58] Yeah that's what amounts
[1183.58 → 1184.24] To relaxing
[1184.24 → 1185.36] Yeah but like it is
[1185.36 → 1185.86] Kind of
[1185.86 → 1186.24] Yeah
[1186.24 → 1187.54] Like it's a slow-down
[1187.54 → 1188.16] And it's fine
[1188.16 → 1188.92] And I don't mind it
[1188.92 → 1189.54] Kind of work
[1189.54 → 1190.70] But like it's the kind of thing
[1190.70 → 1191.60] We would have done anyway
[1191.60 → 1192.14] Yeah
[1192.14 → 1193.46] Like go hang out on a forum
[1193.46 → 1194.52] And answer some questions
[1194.52 → 1195.84] It's like we already did that crap
[1195.84 → 1196.58] Before we
[1196.58 → 1197.18] Exactly
[1197.18 → 1198.18] Owned the domain
[1198.18 → 1199.68] That the questions were coming in on
[1199.68 → 1200.76] Yeah so it's like
[1200.76 → 1202.02] It's not really that big of a deal
[1202.02 → 1203.34] I don't know
[1203.34 → 1205.18] Shout out to the moderators
[1205.18 → 1206.56] They've been doing a perfect job lately
[1206.56 → 1207.88] Welcome to the team
[1207.88 → 1208.52] Blade of Grass
[1208.52 → 1212.86] Alright well
[1212.86 → 1214.12] I guess I'll go home
[1214.12 → 1215.72] Hang out with my sick
[1215.72 → 1216.44] Two-year-old
[1216.44 → 1217.18] I have to shower
[1217.18 → 1217.88] Peanut butter
[1217.88 → 1219.62] And jam out of my hair
[1219.62 → 1220.14] Yeah me too
[1220.14 → 1221.48] And then uh
[1221.48 → 1222.62] Head off as well
[1222.62 → 1223.58] Alright
[1223.58 → 1224.62] Peace guys
[1224.62 → 1225.50] Bye everyone
[1225.50 → 1226.40] See you in the new year
[1226.40 → 1226.86] Thanks for
[1226.86 → 1227.80] Hanging out with us
[1227.80 → 1228.38] In the after party
[1228.38 → 1228.98] It's going to be weird
[1228.98 → 1230.24] This 2015 next time
[1230.24 → 1230.78] I know
[1230.78 → 1232.94] It's going to be all like
[1232.94 → 1234.38] I'm going to be older
[1234.38 → 1236.12] I'm going to be 30 next year
[1236.12 → 1236.32] No
[1236.32 → 1237.16] I'm not good
[1237.16 → 1237.78] Thank goodness
[1237.78 → 1239.70] 29
[1239.70 → 1241.02] Yeah I was like
[1241.02 → 1243.28] How did you just get older that much
[1243.28 → 1245.14] Like you didn't even have a birthday
[1245.14 → 1246.72] How did that happen
[1246.72 → 1249.18] So confused
