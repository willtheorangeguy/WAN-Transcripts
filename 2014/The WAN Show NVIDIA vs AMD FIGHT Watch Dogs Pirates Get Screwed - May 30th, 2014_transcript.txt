[0.00 --> 13.86]  oh we have no branding come back branding where are you okay there's one of them hold on
[13.86 --> 22.30]  bring all the things back all right welcome to the WAN show the weekly show where you listen to us
[22.30 --> 27.04]  talk for anywhere from I think the shortest show we've ever done is about an hour and a quarter
[27.04 --> 33.34]  and the longest ones we've done are like reaching up around three hours yeah we've we've done some
[33.34 --> 38.38]  I have to go at six you have to go at six yeah what do you think this is some kind of company
[38.38 --> 43.16]  where like work ends at six I think this is the first time that I've even said that in like a
[43.16 --> 49.04]  really long time why are you still wearing that yeah I'm wearing my lav mic because I uh yeah
[49.04 --> 53.24]  because I'm wearing my lav mic I'm gonna take my lav mic off you know what I wonder if that would
[53.24 --> 57.50]  just be the solution I should I should yell at Brandon to bring me the other thing and if we
[57.50 --> 62.90]  just each wore lavs I wonder if that would just be better anyway guys we've got a great show for you
[62.90 --> 71.78]  today as always this week the big topics are the Gameworks controversy Nvidia and AMD are at it again
[71.78 --> 78.62]  and surprising super butthurt at each other again surprising we're really surprised oh yeah here
[78.62 --> 84.16]  you're a little far over that way scoochin we never uh we never can quite get the whole where
[84.16 --> 90.52]  we should put like x's on the chair so that we know like where it aligns with kind of the butthole
[90.52 --> 98.36]  so that you can be in exactly the right spot every week uh yeah that would work yeah I mean if we
[98.36 --> 103.04]  didn't want to go for the whole butthole thing then we could just put like butt marks around the
[103.04 --> 107.92]  outside of where the cheeks go but then if one of us put on some weight then we wouldn't be able to see
[107.92 --> 115.56]  them anyway not that that's happened to either of us lately we switched I wouldn't we switched I
[115.56 --> 122.84]  know oh my goodness we did too yeah you'll get it back I don't really want to talk about it all
[122.84 --> 129.26]  right so there's the AMD thing there's an SSD middleware that could be coming that could they're
[129.26 --> 136.56]  claiming quadruple your SSDs performance and this is without actually buying a new SSD although I'd be
[136.56 --> 142.48]  surprised to see something like that implemented for free what else we got oh I gotta jump back up
[142.48 --> 146.06]  there uh Google is gonna start building their own self-driving cars they've had this kind of stuff
[146.06 --> 149.60]  going on for a while but they're actually gonna start manufacturing these cars which is really
[149.60 --> 155.42]  interesting and true crypt may or may not be compromised I'll talk about that more later may not
[155.42 --> 162.12]  yeah there's new stuff that I found recently oh even more new stuff okay this is an ever-changing topic
[162.12 --> 172.24]  so
[172.24 --> 196.86]  so our sponsors of the show today are asus with the excellent g750 jay-z gaming notebook
[196.86 --> 206.28]  and of course modus who are running their geek stakes 2014 facebook sweepstakes where you and
[206.28 --> 213.16]  anyone you know who's interested in getting a job as a in the it industry can go and head over to
[213.16 --> 218.38]  facebook.com slash modus to get more details on how you can win a bunch of really cool stuff it's
[218.38 --> 222.60]  been running all week and actually we've been getting a lot of pretty darn positive feedback
[222.60 --> 230.58]  about it so stay tuned for us to explain more about that later after we actually do a show here so
[230.58 --> 238.74]  first order of business you know what why don't we just straight up jump into the nvidia amd thing i
[238.74 --> 244.06]  think that's uh that's a pretty nice topic to give to the people who were sitting there waiting for
[244.06 --> 249.44]  us to start the show you guys are awesome thank you for being on time even though we rarely are
[249.44 --> 253.74]  were we on time today ish ish like one minute late yeah i think we're like one minute late
[253.74 --> 260.82]  and we pre-streamed a little bit before but like my laptop still isn't plugged in so if screen sharing
[260.82 --> 266.18]  doesn't work the way that it normally should we need that checklist we're yeah we're we're gonna be in a
[266.18 --> 275.40]  little bit of trouble here so yeah all right okay so this was posted originally by booker dewitt
[275.40 --> 283.56]  on the forum and it is an article from forbes about why watchdogs is bad news for amd users and
[283.56 --> 292.72]  potentially the entire pc gaming ecosystem so this isn't exactly a new thing for amd to wave the flag
[292.72 --> 299.42]  about and what they're basically saying is that gameworks represents a clear and present threat to
[299.42 --> 305.38]  gamers by deliberately crippling performance on amd products now what gameworks effectively
[305.40 --> 311.72]  is is it's a um it's a it's a toolkit that game developers can use to implement features
[311.72 --> 318.84]  or um basically features features or graphical um well really features features features features
[318.84 --> 324.80]  features features implement features into their games without actually coding the whole thing
[324.80 --> 331.70]  themselves so when i was at nvidia's um montreal event they were showing off some of the big improvements
[331.70 --> 338.82]  that they had made recently to gameworks with things like particles and fire where to to put it
[338.82 --> 346.50]  sort of in really really simple terms it's kind of like on a camera having a profile that makes the image
[346.50 --> 352.18]  look better or adds an effect to your image where the game developer doesn't actually have to dial in
[352.18 --> 356.10]  all the manual settings and figure out how to do themselves so it's basically like think of it like
[356.10 --> 362.34]  dragging and dropping fire effects into your game so that it looks like this great realistic fire
[363.06 --> 369.70]  when all you had to do yourself was like put it there and then it animates itself so that's what
[369.70 --> 377.94]  gameworks is but what amd doesn't like about it is that developers license these proprietary nvidia
[377.94 --> 384.82]  technologies in order to make their games look great but that doesn't give amd any kind of real
[384.82 --> 391.46]  insight or necessarily a way to optimize their driver to perform well when rendering that feature
[391.46 --> 397.46]  in that game so things like smoke and lighting and textures and shadows and all that kind of stuff
[397.46 --> 406.18]  can hurt performance on amd cards says robert hallix so participation often okay so okay this is from the
[406.18 --> 411.38]  original article so participation in the gameworks program often precludes the developer from accepting
[411.38 --> 416.50]  amd suggestions that would improve performance directly in the game code the most desirable form
[416.50 --> 423.30]  of optimization so basically he's also saying that this makes it more difficult for them to perform
[423.30 --> 431.06]  their own after the fact driver optimizations and it's basically yeah you know amd doesn't support or
[431.06 --> 439.38]  condone such activities and it's like super poopy and terrible now a couple days went by and nvidia fired
[439.38 --> 445.78]  back and basically i'm a little surprised at how long it took but i can understand why they would
[445.78 --> 450.82]  have wanted to be very careful about their response they don't want to say anything that's that's not
[450.82 --> 455.94]  correct so nvidia came back and said look we'll have a we have a kickoff meeting with the developers
[455.94 --> 461.54]  we'll brainstorm cool new effects we'll show them the catalogs that we have and then we'll prototype
[461.54 --> 465.54]  something outside of their engine give them an idea what the effect might look like and we work with the
[465.54 --> 472.58]  developers but we don't and never have restricted anyone from getting access as part of our agreements
[472.58 --> 477.14]  not with watchdogs and not with other titles our agreements focus on interesting things we're going
[477.14 --> 482.82]  to do together to improve the experience for all pc gamers and of course for nvidia customers we don't
[482.82 --> 488.10]  have anything in there restricting anyone from accessing source code or binaries and developers are free
[488.10 --> 499.38]  to give builds out to whoever they want it's their product so pretty much where we're at right now
[499.38 --> 506.42]  is he says she says which is the usual thing with amd and nvidia um i don't think i don't think
[506.42 --> 511.22]  we're likely to get any kind of an official response from any game developer because the last thing they're
[511.22 --> 517.94]  going to want to do is jeopardize yeah their relationship remember game developers need both amd and nvidia on
[517.94 --> 525.70]  board ultimately even uh the way it's meant to be played title the dev wants it to run on amd cards
[525.70 --> 531.54]  they're not going to ignore 40 of the market or 30 however odd percent of the market by just making it
[531.54 --> 536.58]  run like poo on amd cards if they don't have to there's there's some speculation about the whole source
[536.58 --> 541.54]  code thing because they could be like yeah you can release the source code but our parts are obfuscated so
[541.54 --> 547.38]  you can't actually read that part of the source code so you can get to some of it but then whenever one of
[547.38 --> 552.26]  the game works effects is going to go off you're really not going to know what's happening there
[552.26 --> 557.54]  so it's it's it's it comes down to wording and what's actually being said so let's talk a little
[557.54 --> 565.06]  bit about what you'd rather see i mean amd did their whole mantle thing which i don't think they've
[565.06 --> 571.38]  actually opened it up to nvidia yet even though they said that they would at some point where basically
[571.38 --> 578.34]  the game would have to be coded completely differently to run um on directx versus on mantle
[578.34 --> 584.90]  whereas what nvidia is doing is they're approaching developers and going okay here's a feature it'll run
[584.90 --> 592.34]  on whatever but the performance is obviously you know built for our hardware we're optimizing for
[592.34 --> 598.34]  nvidia um and the positive and negative things here are both pretty clear to me so positive number one
[598.34 --> 603.94]  is that we're getting much better visual effects than we otherwise would have been able to or much
[603.94 --> 612.02]  less work required for very small devs to create visually stunning games games that will run on amd
[612.02 --> 618.18]  but won't necessarily perform the best and then the disadvantage is that it creates this segmentation
[618.18 --> 624.98]  where nvidia is kind of helping developers make games that run better on nvidia hardware
[628.34 --> 633.62]  and potentially depending on who you believe make it more difficult to run on amd hardware or at least
[633.62 --> 639.22]  more difficult to optimize yeah i don't know if i'd say more difficult to run so if you had your way
[640.58 --> 647.38]  would you say i developer x i would like you to use gameworks or i wouldn't like you to use gameworks
[648.34 --> 653.86]  and let's say let's say i let's give you guys two you know what let's get struggle struggle it so i want
[653.86 --> 660.82]  two options i want triple a developer and then i want indie developer so allow multiple poll choices
[660.82 --> 668.34]  so aa developer yes aaa developer no indy yes indy no would you like for them to use it or would you
[668.34 --> 673.62]  like for them to not if they can save some dev costs if they can bring it to you earlier if they can
[673.62 --> 680.82]  spend that time on developing gameplay more as opposed to animating better fire or something like that
[680.82 --> 688.82]  how do you guys feel about it because i mean for to me gameworks is a very natural evolution of what
[688.82 --> 698.02]  already existed as gaming evolved the way it's meant to be played these programs where nvidia and amd
[698.02 --> 704.18]  and often both of them at the same time are working very closely with game developers in order to optimize
[704.18 --> 710.18]  the game to me this is just nvidia taking a very proactive approach to that so instead of a game developer
[710.18 --> 714.34]  building something bringing it to nvidia and them going okay let's optimize it they're giving them
[714.34 --> 722.58]  something that's optimized in the first place it doesn't feel wrong to me but it does put amd at
[722.58 --> 728.82]  a disadvantage but that's just amd or that's just nvidia working very closely with developers and
[728.82 --> 734.50]  proactively helping developers make better games even though they could they could go out of their way
[734.50 --> 741.86]  and let the source code be leaked to amd if you were nvidia would you do that see but they built the
[741.86 --> 745.94]  technology yeah you've got you've got multiple arguments for that as well but then you can turn
[745.94 --> 751.86]  around and go amd built trust effects and allows anyone to use it in all one game that it's being
[751.86 --> 759.14]  used in whereas nvidia has created i mean that's something that i got to look at too and i go okay amd or
[759.14 --> 764.34]  nvidia can say here's what we're giving to developers but at the end of the day whether or not developers
[764.34 --> 768.90]  are using them to me even though i'm not a game dev and i don't really understand how these tools work
[768.90 --> 773.38]  very intimately i look at it and i go well this is the one the developers are actually using
[775.46 --> 781.14]  how useful was the other stuff that they're not using i don't know yeah i don't know personally i don't
[781.14 --> 785.30]  think i'm as as against games works as a lot of people are and that's that's another thing too like
[785.30 --> 791.14]  if you look back at the forbes article they have a picture for uh 290x versus 770
[794.50 --> 801.46]  if you see that oh uh can you send me the link it's in the doc it's in the doc oh that makes sense
[801.46 --> 806.90]  okay right there there we go all right so guys here's the the image that luke is referring to and
[806.90 --> 810.90]  then if you go to i wonder if i can find it on the network i should be able to find it on the network
[810.90 --> 816.74]  i should have looked for this earlier but my charts i seriously don't think it was that bad
[816.74 --> 823.54]  like the the gap differences for tier equivalents right were really not that far away especially
[823.54 --> 830.66]  considering like how scared so many people were at the very beginning and considering that we run stock
[830.66 --> 835.86]  coolers on everything yeah so the current nvidia stock coolers are making colder cards than the current
[835.86 --> 841.62]  amd ones are which are running really hot so a lot of our overclocking and nvidia benefit from a cooler
[841.62 --> 846.42]  running card yeah exactly so some of our overclocks are getting higher on nvidia right now just because
[846.42 --> 852.98]  we have more overclocking headroom due to thermals if we we we do stock cards so next generation might
[852.98 --> 861.38]  flip-flop reference cards reference cards yeah sorry um so like it's not like that changed and the amd
[861.38 --> 866.26]  cards are still really close so i don't know i don't see it being this horrible thing that everyone's
[866.26 --> 870.10]  talking about like maybe it was harder for amd to do it i know they're talking about how they're not
[870.10 --> 875.86]  going to be able to fix it as much afterwards with drivers as they could have before um it's in the
[875.86 --> 880.82]  actual folder for the actual thing yeah it's okay i mean ultimately the thing here though is that
[880.82 --> 887.70]  both amd and nvidia did manage to have optimized drivers available for the game's public release
[887.70 --> 897.06]  and then for all the good it did anyone because watchdogs is well yeah a bit of a dog right now in
[897.06 --> 903.86]  the forbes article that he's showing 290x and 770 being very competitive in mine here i've got it now
[903.86 --> 913.06]  here we go there so guys have a look at this so we've got 780 and 290x being within 10 of each other
[913.06 --> 919.70]  and then 290 trailing another couple of percent after that with 770 getting absolutely destroyed
[919.70 --> 926.50]  and like everyone calls us nvidia fanboys and like what the forbes article showed them with the
[926.50 --> 932.34]  770 winning and they're like amd was crushed in this blah blah like no they did totally fine
[933.14 --> 939.94]  it wasn't even that bad for how much they were suppressed and stuff yeah like i don't actually see
[939.94 --> 944.50]  it as being that big of a deal maybe the run that i had didn't have a crazy amount of game works
[945.06 --> 952.18]  effects i don't like i don't know i really don't think i wonder what forbes.com knows about game
[952.18 --> 958.90]  benchmarking anyway no and i'm not even i'm not even i actually didn't read the article so straight up
[958.90 --> 963.22]  i didn't read the article maybe you guys can tell me maybe they have a fantastic benchmarking methodology
[963.22 --> 968.90]  i'll be the first to admit ours isn't the best either but i i like i just i wonder how they're actually
[968.90 --> 975.14]  benchmarking the game yeah uh because it just has nothing to do with the results that we're getting
[975.14 --> 982.18]  so and i to my knowledge they haven't done a ton of video card reviews like i saw an r9 295 x21 because
[982.18 --> 987.22]  i was getting a lot of tweets back when that card was released going hey linus why did you not get a
[987.22 --> 993.22]  sample of this card and forbes.com did and i was kind of like i don't know um because forbes isn't
[993.22 --> 998.74]  really known they're more known for market analysis and less known for actually taking physical
[998.74 --> 1004.66]  hardware and reviewing it so it just seemed like a bit of a a bit of a weird thing to me yeah so there
[1004.66 --> 1011.30]  you have it guys um that's the current state of affairs we'll update you guys if anything happens but
[1011.30 --> 1017.78]  i personally see this as a bit of a non-issue for the moment especially because the differences in
[1017.78 --> 1022.98]  performance really don't look very different from other games whether they are a way it's meant to be
[1022.98 --> 1030.18]  played or a gaming evolved title in fact i haven't seen obvious optimization to the point where it's
[1030.18 --> 1038.98]  like yes this game is clearly handicapped in a really long time yeah all right so moving on to
[1038.98 --> 1046.58]  our next topic speaking of watchdogs this was an article from the register but uh they're not the
[1046.58 --> 1055.54]  only ones reporting on this tens of thousands of watchdogs pirates enslaved by bitcoin bot master i
[1055.54 --> 1064.34]  think that's a very sensationalist headline but it doesn't change anything about the fact that pirating
[1064.34 --> 1072.18]  games is just plain not a very good idea sometimes so basically what was happening is your machine you
[1072.18 --> 1077.22]  would install the game and run it and your machine would launch another executable that would start
[1077.22 --> 1085.78]  to mine bitcoins for the right now it's not very clear whether it was the original cracker of the
[1085.78 --> 1090.10]  game or whether it was someone who took a cracked release that they claim they never did maybe you
[1090.10 --> 1094.66]  have some on the on the watchdogs video people were saying that i was wrong because i said the the guy
[1094.66 --> 1100.34]  that cracked it put in the thing but then other places where i've looked up are saying that the guy that
[1100.34 --> 1108.02]  cracked it just faked skid row's name skid row is a very popular well-known game cracker um so i don't
[1108.02 --> 1114.10]  know what actually happened but something happened and one that a lot of people downloaded had a minor in
[1114.10 --> 1119.86]  it so so the great thing about this is particularly on lower end machines that was having a dramatic
[1119.86 --> 1125.62]  impact on the game's performance which might be where some of the oh watchdogs runs terribly stuff
[1125.62 --> 1131.86]  was coming from although from what we've seen it really doesn't look better than something like
[1131.86 --> 1136.42]  far cry 3. unless the official version also has a minor in it i don't just i'm kidding
[1137.78 --> 1144.34]  one thing that i thought was pretty funny that's interesting what a free game that instead of being
[1144.34 --> 1149.14]  you can choose you can go okay i'll pay for the game or i'll mine for you or i'll mine for you
[1149.14 --> 1155.30]  that's interesting anyway um moving moving along one thing i want to bring up one another one of the
[1155.30 --> 1159.94]  comments on the video i should have quoted this somewhere but the guy was saying um it's it's
[1159.94 --> 1164.42]  funny because the pirated version didn't get a three-hour mission which was defeating you play to be
[1164.42 --> 1168.10]  able to play the game yeah i know right that was hilarious i don't know he might have said it in some
[1168.10 --> 1174.42]  other way but yeah it's so true trying to benchmark it was really difficult because logging into you play
[1174.42 --> 1178.98]  was such a challenge half the time would just be like you don't have an internet internet connection i'm like
[1178.98 --> 1184.18]  actually yeah i do would really like if you just worked now and you have to sit there clicking try
[1184.18 --> 1190.18]  again for like forever so the way that it worked is it would launch this miner and then once you close
[1190.18 --> 1198.58]  down the game that would actually continue to run so whoever did this is like pretty freaking oh yeah
[1198.58 --> 1204.50]  happy right now yeah and then there's a bunch of pretty upset people about the uh about well the fact
[1204.50 --> 1208.90]  that they just generated a bunch of bitcoins for some butthead you part of the game
[1208.90 --> 1215.38]  so i can't feel that bad one of the conspiracy theories running around was that ubisoft did it
[1217.86 --> 1222.58]  i don't think they're that in need of money but that would be that would be pretty funny leaking your
[1222.58 --> 1227.94]  own pirated game but just putting a like a bitcoin miner in it so it's like yeah you don't want to
[1227.94 --> 1235.62]  pay for the game guess what dog that would actually be really funny or if it was like some guy at ubisoft
[1236.18 --> 1243.62]  that did it with that intention fantastic all right let's move on to our oh we never got the straw poll
[1243.62 --> 1249.62]  results did i get a link for that i posted in chat a billion times um i don't think i have the link so
[1249.62 --> 1257.62]  i do okay i i i'm afraid of what's going to happen if we do this but if i just no no no just go to chat
[1257.62 --> 1261.94]  go to chat okay i'm going to chat i'm going to chat i got this i got this okay guys so let's have a look
[1261.94 --> 1269.78]  at the straw poll results i don't remember what i asked ah yes should they use gameworks and wow
[1271.06 --> 1277.46]  so the majority of you you made it a multi-vote poll right yeah well i don't think too many people voted for
[1277.46 --> 1282.10]  more than one result i think that adds up to about 100 but anyway the majority of you are just saying
[1282.10 --> 1288.82]  yes you you and especially indie devs you'd like to see indie devs be able to take advantage of this
[1288.82 --> 1295.62]  deliver a game i mean that runs on amd hardware based on the amount of votes there so okay it doesn't
[1295.62 --> 1302.42]  matter yeah so that might look better than if i don't remember what i'm talking right that might
[1302.42 --> 1307.14]  look better than if they had to code all this stuff themselves as long as it runs on amd then you're
[1307.14 --> 1312.58]  still totally cool with them optimizing it using nvidia's tools so i mean i think that's great
[1312.58 --> 1317.62]  because there's been a lot of a lot of back and forth about this with some people declaring game
[1317.62 --> 1322.50]  works to be the worst thing ever and others you know kind of trumpeting the nvidia horn and i don't
[1322.50 --> 1328.34]  think either is the right answer it's somewhere in between as it usually is whenever fanboys get
[1328.34 --> 1334.02]  involved in some kind of an argument yeah i don't know i just i just don't like i when i when i was
[1334.02 --> 1338.10]  reading through all this kind of stuff i was expecting the worst thing ever me too and then
[1338.10 --> 1344.34]  it was just really not that bad i was i was expecting half of watchdogs to basically be
[1344.34 --> 1351.54]  running off of like nvidia grid at their headquarters and ubisoft didn't even know what was inside the
[1351.54 --> 1356.82]  black box but it's not that at all wasn't it bioshock where if you had an amd card you couldn't see
[1356.82 --> 1360.98]  certain effects in the game if you can see the water coming out of a pipe uh you're thinking of
[1360.98 --> 1366.02]  borderlands 2 borderlands 2 yeah sorry no like i was expecting something more along those lines
[1366.02 --> 1373.22]  yeah and that is that is still something that a bothers me and b i do think is terrible for the
[1373.22 --> 1379.86]  industry like the way that physics is implemented and will always be implemented as long as it's not
[1379.86 --> 1386.58]  something that amd and nvidia users can leverage equally is just not that compelling to me once we can
[1386.58 --> 1393.06]  use physics technology across the board you could actually make a game that's designed to use it
[1393.06 --> 1399.46]  yeah and make that destructibility of the environment and all those other things that you can do through
[1399.46 --> 1406.66]  physics part of an integral part of gameplay i mean the the last game we got that really used physics was
[1406.66 --> 1415.78]  like cell factor and that was a physics showcase piece yeah i'm still waiting and for that yeah and poopy
[1416.58 --> 1424.18]  not a very well received game at all i mean as much as it's great to walk around on the street and
[1424.18 --> 1432.58]  like kick cans out of your way it doesn't feel like a compelling gameplay element to me all right so
[1432.58 --> 1438.82]  the original poster on linus tech tips.com was ren for this one finally a super easy name to say yeah i
[1438.82 --> 1446.74]  know right i have so much difficulty with that ren please post more jp research team develops ssd middleware
[1446.74 --> 1453.94]  that improves speed by 300 and the headlines don't seem to necessarily all agree about exactly how this
[1453.94 --> 1459.94]  works but basically what they're doing is instead of writing data to a on a new blank page data is written
[1459.94 --> 1465.86]  on a fragmented page located in the block to be erased next so it's kind of predictively because the way that
[1465.86 --> 1472.90]  ssds work is you can't just overwrite something you have to blank it first which is actually the
[1472.90 --> 1478.58]  time consuming part of writing something but it gets more complicated than that you don't just you
[1478.58 --> 1484.02]  can't just blank something and then write over top of it because you might need to rearrange some of the
[1484.02 --> 1488.82]  stuff that's written within that cell and put it somewhere else but that gets more complicated than
[1488.82 --> 1493.54]  that because you don't even if you were to rewrite all this stuff all over the place blanket and then
[1493.54 --> 1500.18]  write to it you don't want to unnecessarily blank pages if you don't have to because that significantly
[1500.18 --> 1506.34]  degrades the longevity of the ssd so the way that they work is really complicated what this is going
[1506.34 --> 1512.26]  to do is it's going to look for predictively which one is going to be blanked next and then try to
[1512.26 --> 1518.74]  proactively make room for your right so it might not affect read speeds that much but it will affect
[1518.74 --> 1523.06]  reads in the context of that you won't have to wait around for writes and it should affect write
[1523.06 --> 1528.90]  speeds dramatically and they're also claiming that you could increase the product life up to i think
[1528.90 --> 1534.98]  they're saying around 55 percent not to mention you lower power consumption because you're not doing as
[1534.98 --> 1544.02]  much random shuffling around of data but wait there's more it looks like this could be as simple as a
[1544.02 --> 1550.74]  middleware layer that sits between the ssd and your operating system and it does all or between your
[1550.74 --> 1557.14]  driver or between the controller sits in the middle it sits in the middle somewhere and you might not
[1557.14 --> 1563.46]  even need a new ssd which is kind of awesome i i don't see a ton of different manufacturers implementing
[1563.46 --> 1573.78]  this for free yeah i'd imagine it's going to be more like uh now with turbo charge uber wanger i don't
[1573.78 --> 1583.14]  know whatever i don't wanger could mean fast probably not no no i'm thinking wow that car is totally wanger
[1583.14 --> 1589.86]  oh god don't make that a thing um it was in a simulation so i'm not sure if we'll see exactly this
[1589.86 --> 1594.58]  much speed and power improvement all that kind of stuff in real life but it's exciting to see someone
[1594.58 --> 1602.42]  improving ssds in this way yeah yeah i mean ssd the thing about ssds is look at how stagnant it's been
[1602.42 --> 1610.66]  yep in terms of flash speeds in terms of interface speeds and in terms of capacities it's not really
[1610.66 --> 1617.46]  moving very fast and everyone's kind of jumping on the whoa we need pci express and we need sata express
[1617.46 --> 1625.70]  well we needed it two years ago did we flash is not getting faster with each new generation flash
[1625.70 --> 1630.74]  is continuing to actually get slower and less reliable because of the smaller manufacturing
[1630.74 --> 1635.70]  processes and it's not like and we're not going to get a dramatic improvement there until we get
[1635.70 --> 1641.38]  a big shift in the way that flash is manufactured so people are saying wanger in chat raise your wangers
[1642.10 --> 1647.30]  okay guys you've got two minutes of raising wangers all you want and then we need it to go away or
[1647.30 --> 1654.02]  we're going to start giving people times at timeouts um but basically we need more we need smarter
[1654.02 --> 1658.58]  software we need smarter controllers in order to really get more out of our ssds i think a great
[1658.58 --> 1667.30]  example is plexters m6e which is not straight up not faster than a sata ssd in real world tests yes you
[1667.30 --> 1673.94]  get better sequential reads and not necessarily even writes but we're limited by other factors still so yeah
[1673.94 --> 1678.50]  yeah i don't know it'll be interesting to see what this does when it's actually in the hands of
[1678.50 --> 1682.66]  people instead of a simulation yeah because a lot of the time i love it how we're always getting these
[1682.66 --> 1689.06]  like new holographic disc enables 500 terabytes per disc and then it turns out it's impossible to
[1689.06 --> 1693.54]  manufacture there's some other kind of show-stopping and like you can you can put data on it but you can
[1693.54 --> 1699.62]  never read from it it's like oh yeah like you have to like make it out of like you know ubiquitamium
[1699.62 --> 1706.26]  which contrary to the name is not ubiquitous i was just like so everyone has this one
[1708.26 --> 1713.62]  uh that is a segue into skype translator because it's something that they're talking about which i
[1713.62 --> 1719.78]  really don't think is going to happen at least anytime soon it's like way down in rapid fire
[1719.78 --> 1723.46]  okay i'll find it i'll find it go ahead and keep there's not even really much i want to say about
[1723.46 --> 1726.90]  this they're they're trying to do something called skype translator which as far as i can tell is going to
[1726.90 --> 1732.66]  take what you say and translate it into some form of tts or text to speak and then say it out of the
[1732.66 --> 1736.58]  other person's speakers or headphones whatever so you can talk to people over skype in different
[1736.58 --> 1742.74]  languages and it's all translated and this was posted by raffi on the forum but like the open api for
[1742.74 --> 1749.62]  microsoft translating stuff is terrible and it's microsoft so they'll probably work on it and then like
[1749.62 --> 1755.06]  it'll disappear or something and there's way more important things in my opinion that they need to fix
[1755.06 --> 1760.98]  with skype so hopefully they do that instead of making this um i don't know how many people are
[1760.98 --> 1766.82]  going to go for voice chat over skype that don't know how to speak a common language um but it might
[1766.82 --> 1774.66]  be fun honestly when looking at this i see i see it more as being fun than anything else like maybe it'll
[1774.66 --> 1781.46]  help people learn different languages or something like that i don't know i mean i i see it being kind of
[1781.46 --> 1785.78]  niche like something like this like i actually i didn't know about this even though it's about a
[1785.78 --> 1790.90]  four-year-old app for iphone at this point but word lens allows you to look at something in real
[1790.90 --> 1795.62]  time through your phone and have it actually translate on the fly um and it's actually like
[1795.62 --> 1802.10]  it's pretty darn cool we were playing around with it a little bit today at ncix but by and large
[1802.98 --> 1808.74]  most people won't be using it i mean there's i i think that in the future we're going to see language
[1808.74 --> 1815.38]  barriers broken down this way but i just i don't think this is really it we're so far away that
[1815.38 --> 1820.18]  it's kind of it's not like oculus where it's like yeah we're like pumped about this because it's like
[1820.18 --> 1828.42]  happening soon it's like yeah my phone can barely tell what i'm saying to it now with like google voice
[1828.42 --> 1834.02]  yeah i don't think it's really gonna work when it's like going through different languages and then
[1834.02 --> 1838.10]  there's all the problems with converting language into another language and then having it still
[1838.10 --> 1842.50]  make any sense at all yep that's a huge issue especially when you bring in stuff like slang
[1842.50 --> 1848.66]  and other things which leads us pretty well into google starting to build their own self-driving
[1848.66 --> 1854.66]  cars i wish i could say i called this i did say i thought we were going to get an i car but apple has
[1854.66 --> 1860.42]  instead gone it's funny you look at the reversal here where apple used to be all about building it
[1860.42 --> 1867.62]  themselves and google used to be all about partnering whereas now for phones i think that
[1867.62 --> 1874.18]  they have um been bitten a little bit on the whole partnering thing they've created a monster out of
[1874.18 --> 1879.54]  samsung and kind of gone well hold on a second they would have been nowhere yeah without android
[1879.54 --> 1885.62]  without us and you look at glass uh there i mean yes they're releasing the the lightweight android
[1885.62 --> 1890.58]  that's going to run on wearables and they will have partners but it just they've done most of
[1890.58 --> 1895.70]  the branding around it themselves with their own hardware before they're even talking about you know
[1895.70 --> 1899.78]  letting anyone else have access to any of this stuff you look at what they're doing with this car where
[1899.78 --> 1904.58]  they're going to build their own self-driving car you look at nexus program or whatever it's called
[1904.58 --> 1909.62]  silver now or whatever else it seems feels like they're moving in the direction of controlling the
[1909.62 --> 1914.82]  user experience and there is something to be said for that but then apple on the other hand is going okay yeah
[1914.82 --> 1919.46]  we're going to partner with ford and toyota and everyone to integrate our technology into the
[1919.46 --> 1926.82]  existing products so this is it guys yeah it looks ridiculous but that's not really the point it looks
[1926.82 --> 1934.02]  like a super unimpressed little like teddy bear yeah it's kind of look like a face doesn't it
[1936.18 --> 1942.74]  yeah and if you like a totally not happy face at all he's just like nope i'm doing things you
[1942.74 --> 1947.70]  enslaved me to drive around so i guess i can do that or whatever it is kind of slavery i guess
[1949.14 --> 1958.10]  so this was posted on the forum by johnners and instead of even having a steering wheel or pedals
[1958.10 --> 1962.26]  which is something i personally am pretty uncomfortable with i'd like to have the option
[1962.26 --> 1969.22]  to manual override to manual override i mean this is like that um that doctor who episode where the
[1969.22 --> 1976.02]  i robot thing yeah it's well like anything where you know someone decides yeah we're gonna drive you
[1976.02 --> 1981.06]  into the sea yeah and there's nothing you can do about it i i would like to have a steering wheel and
[1981.06 --> 1990.26]  pedals but no it will have a stop and go button and that is pretty much it very interesting self-driving
[1990.82 --> 1996.26]  um you know he can't he can't be sad because the plastic doesn't go that far
[1996.26 --> 2002.74]  so maybe he is sad maybe it's like even worse than we expect because he can't pull the size of his
[2002.74 --> 2008.66]  mouth down anymore so he's showing the least amount of happiness as he can and google is forcing that
[2008.66 --> 2012.34]  little car to be a minimum amount of happy would you miss driving
[2015.30 --> 2016.34]  mmm gross
[2018.34 --> 2023.70]  probably a little bit not really though because if i could do other stuff while i was in the car
[2023.70 --> 2028.58]  be a lot more productive a lot of people won't be able to anyway just because of motion sickness
[2030.18 --> 2035.78]  yeah i'd probably actually have a problem with it like i don't i i i used to get motion sick pretty
[2035.78 --> 2040.74]  hardcore but i just like i think i built up a tolerance to it or something mine seems to flip
[2040.74 --> 2046.34]  flop like one day it'll be a problem and i can't read my phone and then the other day it's totally fine
[2046.34 --> 2051.70]  and like it seems to depend on what car i'm in and who's driving and like there's tons of different
[2051.70 --> 2056.90]  variables so i have no idea it's funny how it's designed to make it seem non-threatening and help
[2056.90 --> 2061.54]  people accept self-driving technology but i just think it looks kind of ridiculous it does and like
[2061.54 --> 2065.22]  saying that that quote right there is like wow i'm now scared
[2068.90 --> 2073.70]  apparently earlier ones will have extra controls so test drivers can take over if there's a problem
[2073.70 --> 2077.86]  that sounds like the one that i would be interested in having yeah so it'll it will be an electric vehicle
[2077.86 --> 2084.02]  it'll have a combination of lasers and radar to drive i mean i personally am really excited for
[2084.02 --> 2089.46]  self-driving technology i just am not a hundred percent sure how i feel about google doing it at
[2089.46 --> 2097.14]  this point with how broke google maps has been for me lately it's just every little thing and you know
[2097.14 --> 2101.14]  what i'm gonna get feedback from people where they go it's great it's amazing it works for me perfectly
[2101.14 --> 2106.10]  every time i'm like yeah that's fine but that doesn't change the fact that my experience hasn't been that
[2106.10 --> 2110.90]  positive lately and all the feedback about how take me home doesn't work and everyone's like yeah
[2110.90 --> 2116.74]  it does i demoed on the show last week you know what it straight up doesn't work for me sorry it
[2116.74 --> 2122.34]  it doesn't work for it's not consistent enough and we're talking about my life and this and this is
[2122.34 --> 2127.06]  like uh people publicly complain about both these things but there's far more people publicly
[2127.06 --> 2130.90]  complaining about google maps and i've been having tons of troubles with it lately i mean you were
[2130.90 --> 2136.02]  trying to find a tim hortons it shouldn't be hard to find a tim hortons in canada and there were
[2136.02 --> 2142.34]  two that my mom was able to give us directions to that google maps was not giving him the nearest
[2142.34 --> 2146.66]  locations for and was telling him to go what like 20 minutes away or something pretty far away and
[2146.66 --> 2151.86]  there was one like down the street walking distance from where i'd parked so i'm sitting here going what
[2151.86 --> 2158.82]  are you guys doing we're talking finding the nearest branch of a chain of restaurants it's super popular
[2158.82 --> 2164.90]  in canada chain of restaurants is functionality that worked two years ago and this one was in a mall and
[2164.90 --> 2168.74]  had been there for a very long time and it didn't know and there was another one down the road that
[2168.74 --> 2174.26]  wasn't in a mall in case being in the mall was the problem this is technology that worked really well
[2174.26 --> 2179.46]  back when i first started using google maps i'm having a lot of trouble with it lately yeah so i don't
[2179.46 --> 2185.38]  know i'm still planning to have you switch to the iphone for a little while just to try it out try apple maps
[2185.38 --> 2190.66]  because i was pretty impressed as long as it doesn't like drive me into a lake like it used to then it'll probably
[2190.66 --> 2200.02]  be fine we can't forget about that speaking of apple apple has confirmed the acquisition of beats so
[2200.66 --> 2208.10]  that whole video that leaked where dr dre was boasting about the world's first i think who who was it i
[2208.10 --> 2212.18]  think it was someone else actually pointing at him and sort of boasting for him but the point was
[2212.18 --> 2222.26]  the world's first rap billionaire um you know what good for him is all i really have to say it is it is
[2223.14 --> 2231.78]  inexplicable to me that beats headphones were ever a thing um but it was reading the verge article here
[2231.78 --> 2237.30]  uh this was posted originally on the forum by best efforts of like every tech enthusiast ever alex goes high
[2237.30 --> 2246.26]  uh this this was i think it was 30 or something like that i can't i can't find the number but based
[2246.26 --> 2253.14]  on some market research i think it was something like 30 percent of headphone buyers above a hundred
[2253.14 --> 2260.26]  dollars wanted an endorsement on it and i'm kind of sitting here going like i weep
[2260.26 --> 2271.46]  for all of this like i just don't know what to say anymore there was uh wait they wanted an endorsement
[2272.10 --> 2277.46]  yeah they wanted to see an endorsement before they would be willing to spend big money on a pair of
[2277.46 --> 2285.22]  headphones so from from a previous verge article allegedly a pair of 200 beats headphones was somewhere
[2285.22 --> 2290.18]  in the neighborhood of 14 to produce i'm not sure if i quite believe that because that might be
[2290.18 --> 2296.10]  a bomb cost but bomb costs do not represent the amount of product development that goes into
[2296.10 --> 2301.38]  building something it doesn't account for r d it doesn't account for you know plastic molding it
[2301.38 --> 2308.42]  doesn't account for any other prototyping processes it doesn't account for marketing where admittedly a
[2308.42 --> 2315.38]  big part of the beats experience is the marketing and celebrity endorsements um probably the biggest that
[2315.38 --> 2321.30]  is probably the biggest part of it but the point is that even the r d it just straight up doesn't
[2321.30 --> 2331.06]  account for all of that um but they're also they're also buying other things while they're buying this
[2331.06 --> 2337.54]  company like they're not just buying like beats yes there's more to it than the headphones i mean i i
[2337.54 --> 2342.82]  think that the fact that the brands are so similar in that they're able to achieve better than
[2343.62 --> 2349.70]  industry margins on their products i think that's a key part of the acquisition all although one other
[2349.70 --> 2356.02]  thing that i'd like to see if it happens is apple's been willing to take less than beats margin on their
[2356.02 --> 2363.62]  products for the sake of building a truly high quality premium product and i would like to see if apple's
[2363.62 --> 2371.46]  willing to spend 44 dollars instead of 14 or even 80 dollars on a pair of beats headphones that they're
[2371.46 --> 2377.62]  willing to sell for 200 or 250 i would like to see what they can bring to that because guys and don't
[2377.62 --> 2384.26]  kid yourselves the companies that you love you know the sennheisers and akgs and audio technicas of
[2384.26 --> 2390.26]  the world they're making pretty good margin on headphones too so it's not like beats is is doing
[2390.26 --> 2396.66]  something it doesn't cost 1500 to make a pair of hd800s yeah to be a hundred percent clear if you think
[2396.66 --> 2402.42]  it costs that much you're dumb yeah i'm sorry but you're actually stupid there's no way it doesn't
[2402.42 --> 2407.62]  cost that much but again there's the r d so i would like to see if apple could tone down the whole
[2407.62 --> 2413.46]  celebrity endorsement thing something they haven't done much with um with i much of anything since like
[2413.46 --> 2418.74]  the bono days um so if they could tone that down a little bit spend a little bit more on the actual
[2418.74 --> 2423.06]  materials and r d i'd be interested to see what they can come up with but they're acquiring more than that
[2423.06 --> 2428.74]  they're also getting their beats's streaming service which is something that apple hasn't
[2428.74 --> 2433.78]  been able to or willing to build for themselves and is becoming much more popular with services like
[2433.78 --> 2440.18]  spotify taking the place of the more traditional it's funny to be calling dollar mp3 downloads from
[2440.18 --> 2446.66]  itunes traditional it feels like not that long ago the ipod revolution was happening right yeah yeah
[2446.66 --> 2452.82]  yeah yeah one thing that's been really frustrating lately is like uh one one group that i've been
[2452.82 --> 2458.98]  listening to a lot is uh man what is it jukebox oh man now i'm not gonna be able to remember what
[2458.98 --> 2462.82]  it's called but it's it's this group on youtube that makes music the only way to possibly buy their
[2462.82 --> 2469.70]  stuff is through itunes like i don't want to install that terrible piece of crap right it's not
[2469.70 --> 2475.54]  monster cat is it no yeah okay yeah i'm not sure i can't remember the name of it someone wants linus
[2475.54 --> 2481.86]  tech audio headphones yeah i don't think so i'll be the first to i'll be the first to admit that i
[2481.86 --> 2490.18]  don't uh i don't know enough about headphones to make headphones so there you have it it happened i i'm
[2490.18 --> 2494.10]  super super interested to see what happens this is apple's biggest acquisition to date
[2494.98 --> 2502.66]  and let's move on then shall we true crypt has been compromised or maybe hasn't been
[2502.66 --> 2508.50]  compromised it's it's an interesting setup if you go to the link at the bottom of the true crypt article
[2508.50 --> 2517.94]  in the doc yeah so posted by ion bassa on the forum here uh yeah that's that was a comment on the thread
[2517.94 --> 2525.06]  oh sorry sorry um well i think i closed it now posted by astro zombie sorry about that now if you go to the
[2525.06 --> 2530.98]  bottom link true crypt.ch this is a new movement that has come up since the whole true crypt thing
[2530.98 --> 2539.14]  happened and this website not only tracks um what's going on with true crypt right now it's the like
[2539.14 --> 2543.54]  safe thing which who knows if that's actually true or not but someone's saying that it's currently safe
[2543.54 --> 2549.38]  at this point in time um but that the source code is just being is just sitting there so how long it'll be
[2549.38 --> 2555.70]  safe for we don't know or if it is even actually safe right now we don't know um these guys are
[2555.70 --> 2562.26]  planning on trying to pick up the project it's not a um what do they call it it's not like a branch
[2562.26 --> 2565.94]  or anything like that they're taking part of the license agreement of true crypt which allows people
[2565.94 --> 2571.78]  to kind of mess with their um source code and they're gonna be making their own so anyone who had
[2571.78 --> 2578.02]  true crypt anyone who's using true crypt uh we're probably not screwed luckily this group has come
[2578.02 --> 2582.26]  together and hopefully good things will come from this they have a blog coming soon they have a forum
[2582.26 --> 2588.18]  coming soon and any information that you need about true crypt will probably be at true crypt.ch
[2590.26 --> 2596.98]  okay so who the heck knows what's really going on right now a little bit of what was going on um it
[2596.98 --> 2602.42]  seems like with the close of windows xp and most things being built into operating systems the true
[2602.42 --> 2610.10]  crypt project has been kind of abandoned um true crypt wasn't it was it was kind of taken for granted
[2610.10 --> 2617.54]  for a really long time the fact that it even existed um and it's been kept up to date by just this fairly
[2617.54 --> 2624.26]  small group of people for a very long time and they're just kind of done that's about it they're
[2624.26 --> 2628.58]  just yeah no it's been like 10 years or something i don't remember exactly how long it's been
[2628.58 --> 2633.38]  but they're done with it now there's uh windows 8.1 is blocking it with their smart screen feature
[2633.94 --> 2640.58]  it's it's where is it i think it's detecting it as malware yeah because it's it might be it might be
[2640.58 --> 2647.54]  now the latest version but then maybe it isn't we don't know yeah i yeah i one thing is i wouldn't go
[2647.54 --> 2653.06]  to true crypt's actual website to download it i would probably go to true crypt.ch as far as i've seen
[2653.06 --> 2660.66]  a lot of people talking right now true crypt.ch seems to be legit um and the true crypt.org website
[2660.66 --> 2664.26]  is a lot of people have been speculating it might have been broken into and things might have been
[2664.26 --> 2669.94]  injected and there might be problems going on i don't know as like seriously as far as i can tell
[2669.94 --> 2675.06]  there's new news coming out about this like every hour i check up on it and we've been on the after
[2675.06 --> 2679.46]  we've been on the show for a little while now so maybe something even changed um but yeah if you're
[2679.46 --> 2683.54]  very interested in true crypt i would check out true crypt.ch and keep paying attention there
[2683.54 --> 2688.58]  hopefully they get their forms and their blog going soon so that people can have a hub to talk about
[2688.58 --> 2696.74]  it on and that should be good and that should be good i hope so this is the conclusion i i really like
[2696.74 --> 2702.34]  true crypt and i use it a lot so i really hope that someone properly picks up this project and keeps
[2702.34 --> 2708.42]  it going and that all the like oh my god the nsa was running it and all this other crap stuff doesn't
[2708.42 --> 2715.46]  end up being true i don't know it probably is uh whatever what i'm hiding is really not that
[2715.46 --> 2723.06]  important so it's fine oh well i guess you can have my online banking information which you probably
[2723.06 --> 2730.74]  have anyways jerks i know right it's like the most disappointing thing ever everything feels futile at
[2730.74 --> 2736.18]  this point but it isn't it's still worth it to keep trying to uh to keep trying to protect your rights and
[2736.18 --> 2741.70]  all that noise yeah speaking of protecting your rights this was originally posted on the forum by
[2741.70 --> 2753.30]  gamer dad all right oh nintendo has a plan for for let's plays and i like if you guys remember that
[2753.30 --> 2760.02]  whole big fiasco that was going on where oops uh oh there we go where nintendo was pulling the
[2760.02 --> 2766.34]  monetization from anyone that was uploading their content so that's audio or video from their games
[2766.34 --> 2772.82]  in fact we had it happen back when we were playing super mario world on the after party and our
[2772.82 --> 2777.86]  monetization got pulled on that video so they just started pulling monetization back to themselves
[2777.86 --> 2782.10]  because i don't know if you guys know how this works but there's a few different things that can happen
[2782.10 --> 2789.30]  if you're infringing content so for example um my default okay so number one is if you have no infringing
[2789.30 --> 2795.70]  content in your video then you dispute whatever claim and then google gives it back to you usually
[2795.70 --> 2802.18]  three days to 14 days later from my experience if you legitimately have infringing content in your
[2802.18 --> 2808.50]  video there's a couple of things that the owner can do so i my default channel upload setting is
[2808.50 --> 2814.26]  monetization but then i uploaded my wedding video to my linus cat tips channel which had a song in it
[2814.26 --> 2821.38]  didn't even think about it so the owner of that song went and they have two options they can either
[2821.38 --> 2826.98]  pull down my video or they can monetize against my video so that every view instead of monetizing for
[2826.98 --> 2832.10]  me monetizes for them and that's what they opted to do so the video is still up there and so that's
[2832.10 --> 2836.10]  what nintendo opted to do is they just pulled the monetization from these videos to themselves
[2836.74 --> 2842.26]  and i kind of look at that and i go like okay yes i i understand you have the right to do that
[2842.26 --> 2848.18]  it's sort of it's just dumb it's not very it's not very black and white whether or not they can
[2848.82 --> 2854.90]  things like they whether or not it's a derivative work or whether or not it's who it actually belongs
[2854.90 --> 2861.46]  to is really not that clear right now legally but youtube's allowing it and nintendo's doing it and
[2861.46 --> 2867.30]  even if they do have the right it's still kind of a dick move yeah um but anyway that whole thing
[2867.30 --> 2877.54]  happened so now their brilliant um plan is to develop an affiliate program to share the revenue
[2877.54 --> 2884.58]  that they've scooped between itself youtube and the content creator like how do you not understand
[2885.14 --> 2888.34]  nintendo's biggest problem right now is that everyone's just ignoring them because it's hard to
[2888.34 --> 2894.58]  remember that they exist at this point in time and then they're trying to make it really difficult
[2894.58 --> 2899.94]  for people to bring them into the spotlight like what what do you what are you possibly thinking
[2899.94 --> 2908.34]  like if any and the kinds of games that nintendo focuses on things like party games or platformers
[2908.34 --> 2912.50]  it's not going to ruin the experience by watching someone play it like i'm not going to not want to
[2912.50 --> 2917.30]  play super smash brothers because i had the entire experience from watching someone else play it
[2917.30 --> 2921.62]  that's stupid like especially something like mario party what you're actually watching that for is
[2921.62 --> 2928.02]  like the experience of those people playing so if it's a game that's heavily story driven and
[2928.02 --> 2935.38]  something where i really think that gamers are going to watch a let's play instead of buying the game
[2935.38 --> 2941.70]  i get it i understand the developers perspective here it's really not fair something like walking dead
[2941.70 --> 2947.38]  or something like wolf among us where it's or brothers tale of two sons basically just a story it's a
[2947.38 --> 2953.22]  movie in the form of a game an interactive game story movie whatever you get my point i get it but
[2953.22 --> 2958.58]  something like nintendo's games really if anything i agree with the let's players and i agree with the
[2958.58 --> 2965.30]  youtubers who are saying look we're driving exposure for your game you should be paying us to play your
[2965.30 --> 2972.42]  game and broadcast it to our thousands of fans so it's just so backwards details will be announced in
[2972.42 --> 2979.38]  the future but i'm really i want to like nintendo i really do yeah like yeah i was like a nintendo
[2979.38 --> 2985.46]  kid growing up so many people where i was you just you're disappointing me nintendo is the revenue
[2985.46 --> 2991.14]  really so much that it's going to affect your your millions of dollars deficit i don't think so i think
[2991.14 --> 2998.90]  you have other things to focus on it's just it seems so blind like it seems like they just have no
[2998.90 --> 3005.78]  idea what's going on so does this all right this this misanthrope and i have a bit of an off and on
[3005.78 --> 3010.66]  sort of good or bad relationship we're a little up and down because sometimes he can be a bit of a
[3010.66 --> 3016.10]  butthead and other times his buttheadedness uh really hits the nail on the head and i think this
[3016.10 --> 3024.18]  post is actually pretty good uh it starts with and it's okay would love for news posts to be written
[3024.18 --> 3029.86]  in a neutral voice i hope he changes his title to resident butthead resident butthead i hope so too
[3029.86 --> 3035.54]  um just because you call them that i think that would be hilarious so the the first line in his
[3035.54 --> 3042.42]  in his article and it is his write-up about it is a developer's defense of 30 frames per second aka
[3042.42 --> 3045.86]  the resolution is just a number argument on crack
[3045.86 --> 3054.42]  so 60f this is this is from who is this what dev is this from again i can't remember right now they
[3054.42 --> 3060.82]  make 1866 i believe it is okay i don't remember the actual name of the depot so here it goes 60 fps
[3060.82 --> 3067.94]  is really responsive and really cool i enjoy playing games at 60 fps but one thing that really changes is
[3067.94 --> 3074.74]  the aesthetic of the game in 60 fps we're going for this filmic look so one thing that we knew immediately
[3074.74 --> 3080.98]  was films run at 24 fps we're going to run at 30 because 24 fps does not feel good to play so there's
[3080.98 --> 3085.46]  one concession in terms of making it aesthetically pleasing but it just has to feel good to play
[3085.46 --> 3092.82]  and i'm kind of sitting here going okay so you both understand the issue and entirely missed the point
[3092.82 --> 3098.02]  at the same time because you understood that 24 fps might be good for film and isn't good for games
[3098.02 --> 3107.30]  but you didn't understand that 30 fps might look filmic in a video but it still isn't good for games
[3107.94 --> 3117.06]  it's still not responsive we actually have a fastest possible episode about refresh rates and how 30 hertz
[3117.06 --> 3127.62]  and thereby 30 fps is just plain not enough information for your eyes per second um coming out tonight that is
[3127.62 --> 3136.02]  sort of along these lines but basically here's the issue 24 fps looks good in a movie because of the
[3136.02 --> 3141.30]  way a camera works and i don't even always agree with that and i don't even always agree either fast
[3141.30 --> 3147.78]  motion in 24 frames per second looks very visually disorienting to me you can see it chop i i don't i
[3147.78 --> 3153.30]  think the last one that i saw was it's not defiance is it defiance i don't remember it's it's basically a
[3153.30 --> 3156.82]  different version of the hunger games which is a different version of some other thing but whatever i don't
[3156.82 --> 3162.66]  care um and they go past this fence yeah and there's a lot of tall poles on the fence and as
[3162.66 --> 3168.50]  it swings past it's just like slice slice slice and you can see the frames chopping it's so looks
[3168.50 --> 3174.98]  redonkulous so but the reason it works is because the way that a camera whether it's film or whether
[3174.98 --> 3181.78]  it's a digital sensor captures light is by exposing it for a certain amount of time that's the shutter speed
[3181.78 --> 3188.98]  is how long it's being exposed for so what happens is if something's moving during that exposure period
[3188.98 --> 3195.94]  you get blur you get natural blur that's why a movie looks so much better with you while you watch it
[3195.94 --> 3201.30]  than it does if you grab a screen grab of it and it looks blurry and poopy because your brain is what's
[3201.30 --> 3208.34]  actually doing the work whereas in a game you don't have motion blur naturally motion blur is not a
[3208.34 --> 3216.02]  natural side effect of of rendering a frame in motion you render frame by frame and motion blur that
[3216.02 --> 3223.62]  gets added to games is terrible because the only way to add motion blur is to either try to anticipate
[3223.62 --> 3230.74]  what's going to happen next or buffer two frames buffer an extra frame so that you can intentionally
[3230.74 --> 3236.50]  blur the difference between them that's how motion blur works in games it's a cheesy effect and it will
[3236.50 --> 3242.58]  never be correct it'll never be good and it'll always add leg maybe don't quote me on that maybe
[3242.58 --> 3247.94]  they'll find some genius like by the time we're hooked up to like our oculus riffs and like our
[3247.94 --> 3252.26]  brain probe things it may actually know what you're going to do next and put motion blur in for you but
[3252.26 --> 3257.78]  by that time we'll have displays that run at 600 hertz and games that run at 600 frames per second anyway so
[3257.78 --> 3263.30]  it doesn't really matter we don't need motion blur in games and 30 fps is not good enough and you can't
[3263.30 --> 3269.06]  compensate with mode with motion blur to make it look more cinematic do it in your cut scene don't
[3269.06 --> 3276.10]  do it in the game and as gamers we have to all demand better we have to ask for better and i know the
[3276.10 --> 3281.94]  hardware for the xbox one and the playstation 4 just straight up isn't good enough to run with modern
[3281.94 --> 3294.02]  lighting effects and all this other stuff so i guess pc i can't i can't find where this is but um total
[3294.02 --> 3300.10]  here 30 fps is not a divine choice it's not a design choice design choice sorry um it is a last resort
[3300.10 --> 3304.66]  when dealing with inferior hardware and he has a whole bunch of other quotes too and my favorite thing in
[3304.66 --> 3311.46]  this whole article actually was the very end where is it so it's actually a kataku article
[3311.46 --> 3315.86]  originally i'll just go ahead and yeah it's it's bullet pointed actually if you scroll down but what
[3315.86 --> 3320.74]  he says is a higher frame rate does not significantly affect sales of a game a higher frame rate does not
[3320.74 --> 3326.02]  significantly affect the reviews of a game right there bullet pointed and like bolded on certain
[3326.02 --> 3332.10]  things and like that's a serious part of the article and total biscuit just tore them apart
[3332.10 --> 3336.98]  on like this exact thing i can't find the exact tweets that he has about it but it's somewhere
[3336.98 --> 3344.50]  else but just like yeah actually it does sorry but you're totally wrong and if it doesn't it should
[3344.50 --> 3349.54]  and but like one of the most outspoken people in terms of game reviews total biscuit which is awesome
[3350.34 --> 3356.58]  um constantly rips on games that are frame rate capped and he's one of the biggest game reviewers there are
[3356.58 --> 3367.30]  are you that blind doesn't affect game reviews you're wrong 100 like just no oh if you were them
[3367.30 --> 3373.22]  what would you do what could you say you can't say the xbox one and the playstation 4 are crappy
[3374.82 --> 3382.26]  and and i would rather they code their game with better effects that we can enjoy on our pcs
[3382.26 --> 3387.46]  and let the console guys run at 30 frames per second rather than just dumbing down the way that
[3387.46 --> 3394.90]  the game runs outright so i still i still would rather they make 30 fps games as long as i don't
[3394.90 --> 3400.02]  have to play them so if you're them what can you say then you have no choice but to do exactly what
[3400.02 --> 3406.26]  they're doing no they just built it terribly just have it so that it looks better on pc and is able to
[3406.26 --> 3410.90]  run faster and have a crippled down version of our console if they do that then it looks like they're
[3410.90 --> 3415.38]  intentionally crippling the console version you have to i mean i think okay really there is a
[3415.38 --> 3420.90]  solution here and i'm just kind of being a jerk right now give a give them a graphic slider on the
[3420.90 --> 3433.62]  console uh or not yeah or a 30 60 toggle why not i could see that yeah why don't see a lot of people
[3433.62 --> 3439.54]  taking advantage of that if the game can run on ps3 and ps4 then it can sure as hell run at 60 fps on ps4
[3439.54 --> 3445.70]  and like just yeah 36 uh 30 60 toggle that just does everything for you yeah why not just like
[3445.70 --> 3450.02]  turns down your resolution a whole bunch turns down any effects a whole bunch but gives you a
[3450.02 --> 3453.70]  smoother gameplay experience some people will prefer that and that's how you get like everybody on your
[3453.70 --> 3458.18]  side yep and because they're gonna be like yeah it's a beautiful game unless you don't want it to
[3458.18 --> 3465.14]  be and then it runs at 60 fps all right so something that actually we should probably do our sponsors
[3465.14 --> 3476.26]  for the show today number one is modus and where is my lower third for that uh that isn't it but we
[3476.26 --> 3483.62]  can go ahead and add it to that in the meantime here it's in the folder yes add media file and
[3484.34 --> 3490.82]  live stream assets and integration lower thirds this is really where is it i'll show you how to do it
[3490.82 --> 3497.78]  faster later is there a faster way to do this but it's cool we'll do it next time uh okay you know
[3497.78 --> 3506.34]  what i don't know what to do right now how about you do your thing and i'll try to get it okay so in
[3506.34 --> 3512.66]  the meantime i'm gonna throw the g but actually it'll be kind of nice to talk about the g750 jz without you
[3512.66 --> 3520.34]  distracting me for a change so guys the asus g750 jz is asus's a okay it's not light
[3520.82 --> 3527.94]  okay it's not particularly small but what it is is it is a powerful desktop replacement grade gaming
[3527.94 --> 3533.62]  notebook that we actually are starting to like more and more as time goes on uh the video we did
[3533.62 --> 3543.06]  yesterday where we pitted gtx 880m versus dual 860ms in sli both with basically the same cpu both with the
[3543.06 --> 3550.26]  same 4g frame buffer was uh those tests were very revealing and we found that if you are willing to accept
[3550.26 --> 3556.02]  the thicker notebook that comes along with being able with needing to be able to cool a really high
[3556.02 --> 3561.22]  performance single gpu because you've got that heat density to contend with you're able to get a
[3561.22 --> 3567.78]  more consistently high performance gaming experience than if you were to rely on something like sli which
[3567.78 --> 3573.94]  is something that i've always really advocated for a single high-end gpu versus two lower-end ones the
[3573.94 --> 3579.62]  drawback of course is that it does come in heavier and it does come in larger but that way is that why this is
[3579.62 --> 3584.98]  the jay-z laptop and then the maybe the other one's two chains because he has two graphics cards boom
[3584.98 --> 3589.78]  stepped in anyways i'm gonna keep working oh i'm so tired of you um and then there are other advantages
[3589.78 --> 3594.90]  with the thicker form factor as well we found that this notebook ran about 15 degrees cooler under load
[3594.90 --> 3601.62]  on the gpu which is significant and ran significantly quieter in addition to being cooler with the fan noise
[3601.62 --> 3607.78]  being more a more desirable low hum versus a high-pitched whine so there you go guys the g750 jz is
[3607.78 --> 3612.82]  powerful enough for video editing and content creation has a desktop grade and and asus doesn't
[3612.82 --> 3617.78]  call it that but i'm just gonna call it that because it truly is desktop grade graphics card in it and
[3618.98 --> 3620.26]  all right what else we got here
[3622.74 --> 3631.54]  oh that is faster geeksteaks 2014 modus is giving away a butt ton like one metric butt ton of really cool
[3631.54 --> 3637.62]  stuff including an oculus rift uh a gaming notebook they're giving away they give away a gaming mouse
[3637.62 --> 3644.42]  already they're giving away a litro camera they're giving away all kinds of freaking awesome stuff and
[3644.42 --> 3649.70]  all you have to do is head over to their facebook page so that's facebook.com modus and you will be
[3649.70 --> 3654.98]  entered for a chance to win it's open to u.s and canadian residents and if you're wondering who the heck modus
[3654.98 --> 3660.66]  is they are an it staffing company which is something that before they reached out to us about
[3660.66 --> 3666.42]  participating in geeksteaks to celebrate geek pride day i was like what's that like oh well it's actually
[3666.42 --> 3673.94]  pretty simple for free people can submit their resumes to us and then we will work with them and with
[3673.94 --> 3679.38]  companies large and small everything from startups to fortune 500 companies to try to place people and
[3679.38 --> 3684.66]  the way they make their money is they have the companies that hire their candidates pay them so
[3684.66 --> 3691.70]  ultimately there is no drawback to an it professional reaching out to modus and seeing what's out there
[3691.70 --> 3695.54]  which is great because if you don't have a job it's not a point in time that you want to be spending
[3695.54 --> 3700.82]  money to try and get a job yeah exactly right i'm gonna get the paid linkedin because
[3701.62 --> 3706.74]  that one will be better and it is a lot better yeah but still linkedin is really good at like
[3707.30 --> 3712.58]  making you pay for it to be useful at all bugging you i know i never had a linkedin account got one
[3712.58 --> 3718.34]  recently i'm just like wow i don't want any more emails from you you get a lot of yeah it's just
[3718.34 --> 3727.30]  like leave me alone i don't care i just wanted to update my profile because it seems smarter than like
[3727.30 --> 3733.46]  writing a resume at this point in time i'm moving into the 21st century it's like well um would you like
[3733.46 --> 3738.02]  a free trial of premium so that people looked at your page this guy sent you a message check your
[3738.02 --> 3743.46]  trigger thing please you just got endorsed for these skills yeah it's like go away endorse people
[3743.46 --> 3747.94]  please i'm not actually looking for a job right now this is a core part of our system i don't care
[3747.94 --> 3754.34]  about you linkedin there should be like a please go away button like please i'll let you know when i'm
[3754.34 --> 3759.70]  like interested in this again please there should be a auto endorse all of my friends just do it
[3759.70 --> 3765.94]  linkedin should totally have a paid option so that i can monitor the activity of my employees
[3766.90 --> 3772.42]  not like read their messages but when my employees start like like i should be able to see their
[3772.42 --> 3778.74]  activity level on linkedin so if i see unusual spikes like blah blah updated the profile sent a
[3778.74 --> 3786.98]  bunch of messages they'll be like something's coming i feel like that would be taken advantage
[3786.98 --> 3791.86]  of immediately like people would use it immediately and it would be terrible and torn apart very quickly
[3793.78 --> 3798.26]  i guarantee you so many like owners would take advantage of it hold on a second though because
[3798.26 --> 3805.54]  there's a lot of linkedin stuff that is public like activity on it so if all yeah maybe not pms but
[3805.54 --> 3812.10]  if i could just get a report of activity i bet you this could be done with a third party probably
[3812.10 --> 3816.58]  could because it's the kind of thing that i could comb through and find myself but if i just had it
[3816.58 --> 3821.06]  automatically generated for me that's very interesting so business idea for someone give us 10
[3821.06 --> 3827.30]  like normal yeah but make this and then sell your bot to people and you can just have the bot crawl
[3827.30 --> 3832.18]  everything all the time so people can get instant reports when they sign up yes and that's what people
[3832.18 --> 3835.14]  will want because they'll want to be able to see results immediately so you just have it
[3835.14 --> 3839.86]  permanently crawling all of linkedin and then wow that's like the evilest thing ever because you
[3839.86 --> 3846.18]  know what's funny is i i don't remember when it was but i think um edsel created a linkedin profile
[3846.18 --> 3852.18]  like right around the time we formed linus media group or updated it or something or like it it creeped
[3852.18 --> 3860.42]  me out that everyone who works here has updated linkedin profiles because i didn't have one until i
[3860.42 --> 3867.46]  started thinking about leaving ncix and so like i i project right like i project my own mindset
[3867.46 --> 3872.50]  where i'm completely not interested in any kind of social network platform even a useful one like
[3872.50 --> 3877.86]  linkedin yeah unless i have an immediate need i didn't have one until a couple months ago and i knew
[3877.86 --> 3882.18]  i was going to get that email from you when i sent you an invite on it but the only reason why i got one
[3882.18 --> 3888.34]  was because i wanted somewhere to put my coursera course whatever like certificate things right and
[3888.34 --> 3892.26]  that's the only place you can display them there's nothing wrong with having updated credentials on
[3892.26 --> 3897.46]  linkedin it's good yeah yeah and like you know i want people who work here to build their portfolios
[3897.46 --> 3900.90]  and like build their careers and stuff like that like i'm it's just one of those things where i just
[3900.90 --> 3905.94]  kind of like are you are you leaving i just lay i lay in bed at night are they all going to be
[3905.94 --> 3912.50]  where are they going please don't leave me why is this happening uh speaking of why is this happening
[3912.50 --> 3919.46]  you know my take on the steam controller was pretty mixed at the beginning i was like really they're
[3919.46 --> 3925.70]  doing this touch pads okay let's see how this goes and then my take on it when i tried it back at ces
[3925.70 --> 3932.58]  even though it was quite an early prototype was okay well let's see where they go from here valve
[3932.58 --> 3938.74]  has basically delayed it they're saying realistically we're looking at a release window in 2015 and that's
[3938.74 --> 3942.98]  pretty much all that they've said this was posted by raffi on the forum wow two this week and i don't
[3942.98 --> 3948.66]  think i've ever seen you before and i like you because you have an easy to pronounce name but basically
[3948.66 --> 3953.70]  my take on this i don't because he makes me feel like my forum's broken with his stupid avatar picture
[3953.70 --> 3966.18]  oh yeah all right my take on this is what probably happened was the original concept of touch pads is
[3966.18 --> 3971.86]  stupid and then you saw what was happening with the prototypes over time how they got closer and
[3971.86 --> 3979.70]  closer and closer to a traditional controller upon which time i think people basically went oh yeah that's
[3979.70 --> 3984.74]  pretty cool but the issue is that it's not really different so i think valve is going through a bit
[3984.74 --> 3988.50]  of an identity crisis right now with the steam controller where they're going okay we wanted
[3988.50 --> 3994.42]  to do something like really innovative that changed the way people use controllers and then we ended up
[3994.42 --> 4000.90]  with something that's pretty samey and we're not getting into this because we just wanted to be a
[4000.90 --> 4006.90]  like controller manufacturer yeah valve doesn't do stuff like that they're not getting into steam os because
[4006.90 --> 4012.50]  they want to make steam machines they want to build an ecosystem valve is so much smarter than wanting
[4012.50 --> 4019.54]  to make gaming peripherals so i think what's happened is they just don't know what it is anymore and if
[4020.18 --> 4024.74]  into i think they're just saying 2015 but it's like valve time so i think i think they're basically
[4024.74 --> 4031.30]  going okay if we can when they're done rejuvenate this project and make it truly different then we'll then
[4031.30 --> 4036.50]  you know let's do that and if we can't i think we might see steam controller just quietly go away
[4037.38 --> 4042.82]  which i'll be 100 okay with because up till now i i don't think there's a lot of room to really
[4042.82 --> 4049.78]  improve on the controller you see third party i mean everyone and their dog has had the opportunity
[4049.78 --> 4057.62]  to improve the xbox 360 controller and we see like exoskeletons that go on it we've seen like you know
[4058.50 --> 4063.78]  rockers so that you just shift your hand to press certain buttons we've seen all kinds of stuff we've
[4063.78 --> 4070.26]  seen modded ones that have the the switches replaced and and the the analog sticks replaced
[4070.26 --> 4074.18]  or joysticks i think they call them now whatever i don't care if they're not if they're not analog
[4074.18 --> 4081.62]  anymore um and no one's really been able to do it and and now 360 controllers freaking awesome and
[4081.62 --> 4087.62]  now we're down to the point where 3d printers are becoming more affordable so even some individual could
[4087.62 --> 4092.74]  create a better controller if they wanted to i just don't think there's any room left to innovate
[4092.74 --> 4097.38]  and maybe i'm totally wrong but i think we're gonna see completely different ways of interacting with
[4097.38 --> 4103.14]  our games like augmented reality and vr before we see a better controller i think the controller
[4103.14 --> 4110.58]  is kind of an amusing amusing ancient way of controlling games by the time my son is my age
[4110.58 --> 4118.34]  like like like the old joystick two button style that's just gone uh well it makes it makes an
[4118.34 --> 4127.38]  interesting um point because nintendo and we also have a patent for like what what was it uh modular ds
[4127.38 --> 4132.90]  did you see that patent no i didn't it was it was a ds but you could slide out all of the parts that
[4132.90 --> 4138.50]  interact with the ds and replace them so people would essentially be able to like make their own d-pad
[4138.50 --> 4143.94]  oh no i did see that the nintendo patent right yeah yeah i remember that sorry so that's it's
[4143.94 --> 4150.18]  interesting because controllers are getting like there's there's so many gamers now i think that's
[4150.18 --> 4155.86]  part of the thing is there's so many gamers across such a huge age gap from everywhere around the world
[4155.86 --> 4160.74]  that it's hard to make something for every single person in existence right so i think it's getting to
[4160.74 --> 4164.98]  the point where it's just like yeah make your own or buy these modular things and swap them out
[4164.98 --> 4174.98]  all right so um i barnacles was defending his use of bing on twitter this week so i i actually i'm
[4174.98 --> 4179.62]  using internet explorer right now because i haven't bothered to sign into all my crap in a real browser
[4179.62 --> 4187.54]  so um it's true bing is the default so i searched for leap motion v2 all right so i get like a bunch of
[4188.26 --> 4194.82]  rubbish sponsored stuff that has almost the whole page worth nothing to do with anything and
[4194.82 --> 4199.46]  arguably my font size is a little bit large like that's probably more like a normal font size but
[4199.46 --> 4207.54]  that is four sponsored results that aren't even related to the leap motion and then the first legitimate
[4207.54 --> 4219.06]  hit is from the developer blog but isn't the leap motion v2 blog post and finally it comes up with this
[4219.06 --> 4228.34]  google boom top one exactly what i'm looking for and i just i this just felt related to
[4232.10 --> 4236.98]  there we go so this is really cool this just felt kind of related to the new ways that we're going to
[4236.98 --> 4243.06]  interact with our devices and what's amazing about this is this is using the original leap motion hardware
[4243.06 --> 4248.74]  they actually haven't changed the hardware this is just a new much lower latency much more accurate
[4248.74 --> 4258.42]  software isn't that cool it's so fast look at that responsiveness it's crazy fast love it so you
[4258.42 --> 4264.02]  know what's funny is they offered to send us a review sample like a year ago no no i contacted them a
[4264.02 --> 4268.58]  year ago and then like months and months ago they were like yeah we'll send you a review sample and i was
[4268.58 --> 4273.78]  like well you know a lot of the hype has died down um do you have anything new coming that maybe we'll wait
[4273.78 --> 4278.26]  for instead they're like yeah we have a software update coming i'm assuming this is it and so i saw
[4278.26 --> 4283.30]  this i reached out to them they're like yeah we're at a review samples again i'm just like guys like
[4283.30 --> 4290.34]  seriously we can help you we just need you to help yourself like i just don't even know what to say at
[4290.34 --> 4299.70]  that point oh they're like yeah we can offer you a small discount and i'm just like really so you have a
[4299.70 --> 4304.50]  review sample for me when you don't have anything interesting and then you i'm like yeah i want to
[4304.50 --> 4310.34]  do you a favor i want to time this to like talk about something new and exciting and it's like oh
[4310.34 --> 4315.46]  yeah sorry next time that they offer you one just take it and then just wait until the next interesting
[4315.46 --> 4321.14]  thing comes out yeah just be like you probably would have just waited if we did something for you
[4321.14 --> 4325.46]  anyways so don't worry about it we'll get this video to you in about a couple months when you would
[4325.46 --> 4330.66]  have contacted us all right so this is two things number one is dog fighting is delayed
[4332.82 --> 4338.74]  yeah star citizen you're disappointing us but there's still time for you to knock our socks off
[4338.74 --> 4343.62]  it's disappointing but i'm happy they didn't release it completely broken yeah i get that i totally get
[4343.62 --> 4349.54]  it i would rather have delays basically chris roberts wrote like this huge long thing it was like yeah look
[4349.54 --> 4357.06]  we want this out there as much as you do and i believe him but there's two of what we would
[4357.06 --> 4363.78]  classify as i think they call them blocker bugs like just utterly game-breaking bugs that we need to
[4363.78 --> 4367.46]  resolve there's some other critical stuff that we really really want to fix and then there's some other
[4367.46 --> 4373.54]  stuff that we want to fix but until we can get those really high priority fixes in there it's not coming
[4373.54 --> 4378.74]  sorry we missed the date it's coming really soon the fact that they waited until the last possible minute to
[4378.74 --> 4384.18]  tell us that it wasn't going to hit the date to me is you can interpret this one of two ways and i lean
[4384.18 --> 4389.14]  towards the second one so you can kind of go dick move guys you're telling us at the last minute we
[4389.14 --> 4394.50]  were all excited or number two could be it's probably because they might have thought they could still make
[4394.50 --> 4400.50]  it yeah yeah so maybe it's that close so i really hope it comes soon really excited guys don't forget to
[4400.50 --> 4406.34]  join the linus tech tips conglomerate star citizen organization we're falling behind because
[4406.34 --> 4412.42]  it's past us what the heck happened yeah some random organization imperium doesn't last time you
[4412.42 --> 4417.14]  talked to them that was like two days ago but no one knew who these guys were well they know who they
[4417.14 --> 4422.02]  are they won the they won like a contest a while back and all this kind of stuff yeah really small
[4422.02 --> 4427.46]  and then out of nowhere they got like five thousand something members in no time at all yeah explore
[4427.46 --> 4433.78]  right now so no you guys need to rally with us seven hundred and twenty six yeah uh let's see they
[4433.78 --> 4439.38]  have time stamps for stuff which is really interesting so yeah they're still updating we
[4439.38 --> 4447.78]  doubled in size again 300 new members that's on april 16th on may 2nd they got 732 members in total
[4447.78 --> 4457.14]  on may 25th they got 1049 members in total may 25th to may 28th they got 4 000 plus members in
[4457.14 --> 4464.02]  total what even happened where did all these people come from so good for them good for them but
[4465.62 --> 4471.14]  minus tech tips conglomerate still gonna be i mean really all of this is just jockeying for position
[4471.14 --> 4475.94]  that is ultimately going to be meaningless once the race actually starts yeah it's kind of like yeah you
[4475.94 --> 4481.06]  look at any i just want to know what happened nascar race formula race does being in front at the
[4481.06 --> 4486.90]  beginning of the race mean that you win no there's a whole lot more yeah and having a
[4486.90 --> 4490.82]  huge amount of members isn't necessarily gonna make you win either that's true quality members
[4490.82 --> 4495.22]  i'm not worried about that the main thing is i'm just confused i don't know what the heck happened
[4495.22 --> 4499.70]  reddit getting really big in passing us that's kind of that's not surprising test squadron getting
[4499.70 --> 4505.62]  really big that's fine uh maybe they'll do just as well in in star season as they did in eve and just
[4505.62 --> 4511.22]  disappear so that's also possible all right so nvidia shifts away from smartphones this is posted by
[4511.22 --> 4516.74]  qwerty warrior basically jensen came out and said okay well we're shifting away from smartphones to
[4516.74 --> 4522.10]  other more profitable markets nvidia chipsets save for tegr 3 have had limited success in the world of
[4522.10 --> 4528.34]  smartphones tegr 4 barely made it into a few devices and tegr 4i hasn't had much luck as far as design
[4528.34 --> 4535.70]  wins go either but nvidia is definitely interested in other markets such as gaming devices like shield for
[4535.70 --> 4542.98]  example which is fantastic and doesn't get enough credit um cars for example i'd love to see tiger
[4542.98 --> 4547.70]  hardware and something like a tv a couple of generations from now when that is going to be
[4547.70 --> 4552.74]  what a console looks like a grid streaming device that just runs in your tv and you don't need to
[4552.74 --> 4558.90]  worry about an extra box bring it on yeah yeah excited for that kind of stuff i mean as internet
[4558.90 --> 4564.50]  connections get better i mean the the connection we have here and the connection you have at home i think
[4564.50 --> 4570.82]  is like you get what like five millisecond pings in games and people are like yeah he's like playing
[4570.82 --> 4575.94]  at valve yeah or whatever like like how do you have how do you have like land level ping i'm like oh
[4575.94 --> 4581.94]  i'm just chilling at valve hq guys it is coming low enough latency is coming so i'm really really excited
[4581.94 --> 4588.34]  about where we're heading there and i i really don't see this as something that'll have a major impact
[4588.34 --> 4593.70]  on nvidia's tegra development cycle it's just i think it's just them kind of basically going yeah that
[4593.70 --> 4598.26]  whole thing is stupid so we give up and with the way margins are being squeezed on phones the only
[4598.26 --> 4603.38]  way to make a profit on a phone is to be very vertically integrated like someone like apple where
[4603.38 --> 4608.50]  you're designing your own processor and your own phone and your own software you're profiting on
[4608.50 --> 4613.46]  people buying apps samsung tried to do it and i think ultimately we're seeing the beginning of the
[4613.46 --> 4618.90]  end of the samsung android empire because they weren't able to turn their their own app store into
[4618.90 --> 4625.22]  anything functional or useful and uh beyond that what's their value i mean it's like they're they're
[4625.22 --> 4630.18]  already having a really hard time convincing people that a galaxy s whatever is significantly
[4630.18 --> 4635.46]  different from a nexus 5 which is much cheaper and it's really just not yeah
[4637.78 --> 4641.78]  i don't know man what else we got for today we're pretty much done we're gonna finish the show early
[4641.78 --> 4645.46]  i guess that's what happens when we start on time huge amount of topics though i think it's just a lot of
[4645.46 --> 4650.82]  them went fast yeah uh there's stuff still in the unformatted which is really let's just do some
[4650.82 --> 4657.22]  straight up q a guys hit us uh atlinus tech on twitter hit us with some q a and we'll well while
[4657.22 --> 4663.70]  they're hitting us up um have you looked at the open open source laptop modular laptop yeah it looks
[4663.70 --> 4669.86]  like the stupidest thing ever right now oh yeah oh yeah apple devices locked and held as ransom
[4669.86 --> 4674.98]  this is kind of brutal so there was a thing going around a while ago where your files were getting
[4674.98 --> 4679.70]  encrypted and then you had to send a ransom and they would unencrypt it well this one this one's
[4681.38 --> 4687.62]  so hack into the device lock it and then so they actually are using the find my iphone feature to
[4687.62 --> 4693.30]  remotely lock your device and then they are telling you that you can't have it back so just we'll have a
[4693.30 --> 4698.34]  message on the screen like that locked message that says if you want it back you have to pay 100 bucks or
[4698.34 --> 4705.38]  euros or whatever else to some hotmail address absolutely brutal guys um i guess that's all i
[4705.38 --> 4710.02]  really have to say about that that sucks i think it's going to be way too trackable though yeah i
[4710.02 --> 4714.10]  don't see this being a problem for much longer payments are flowing like they're gonna find this
[4714.10 --> 4721.30]  guy yeah oh also this is really cool if you guys haven't seen it already the solar roadways thing that's
[4721.30 --> 4727.54]  going on is pretty amazing uh you should check out the indiegogo projects solar roadways they got super
[4727.54 --> 4734.18]  duper funded yeah they got super funded so they should 21 days left i love it this video is actually
[4736.26 --> 4740.34]  oh i don't know if this is even the one that i just the tractor one i think the tractor one's a
[4740.34 --> 4746.10]  different video yeah where's the like fan made one fan solar freaking roadways there it is yeah i ignore
[4746.10 --> 4752.18]  the actual one this one's amazing uh let me just put on some volume for you there solar freaking
[4752.18 --> 4759.22]  roadways there you go they want from me well they're solar freaking roadway okay so actually this
[4759.22 --> 4763.14]  time what is it okay so it's like seven minutes long but it's actually a pretty good watch you guys
[4763.14 --> 4767.94]  should definitely check it out but the main benefits are that you can rear they have leds built into
[4767.94 --> 4773.06]  them so you can rearrange the markings on them however you want really cool they're heated which means that
[4773.06 --> 4779.14]  clearing snow is no longer an issue as well as the flooding that sometimes occurs when snow melts
[4779.14 --> 4785.30]  they're solar so you're utilizing all that area to collect solar energy which is of course the cleanest
[4785.30 --> 4790.74]  energy that we can have you don't have to you don't have to disrupt you know tidal pools you don't have
[4790.74 --> 4796.18]  to disrupt rivers and waterfalls nope nope just sun hits the earth we'll basically become plants
[4797.70 --> 4802.82]  leverage the sun it's all very good stuff um there's a bunch of other really great stuff
[4802.82 --> 4807.14]  about it but it's one of my favorite things is you said you can change the leds on it so
[4807.14 --> 4812.90]  say if two people park in handicapped parking stalls and then they're full they can just create another
[4812.90 --> 4817.78]  one right it can detect that there's actually a video of this it can detect that they're full
[4817.78 --> 4822.02]  and it can just grab a near parking spot and just be like bloop now this one is handicapped because it
[4822.02 --> 4826.42]  can just show on the ground it can warn people about obstructions on the road so they've got sent
[4826.42 --> 4831.06]  pressure sensors in them so if something falls and like demolishes a road it'll be like whoa dog slow
[4831.06 --> 4836.26]  down and like text on the road or if there's a deer like it'll know it'll feel the four hoof prints
[4836.26 --> 4842.66]  and it'll be like yo dog there's a deer up ahead slow down slow down yourself um so it's it's incredibly
[4842.66 --> 4847.78]  exciting probably have these communicating with uh those google cars at some point in time so it can
[4847.78 --> 4851.78]  automatically figure all this stuff out and go around things would love for this to be the future
[4851.78 --> 4858.66]  really really super easy really really low cost power charging stations for electric cars love it there's a
[4858.66 --> 4863.30]  bunch of stuff you had a twitter blitz that happened yeah but there's uh one more thing i wanted to hit
[4863.30 --> 4872.02]  before the twitter blitz so um tech report seagate buys sandforce from lsi for 450 million so this has
[4872.02 --> 4879.70]  been complicated so lsi bought sandforce and then like what was it avago or whatever bought lsi and then
[4879.70 --> 4890.90]  now avago is well by proxy i guess selling sandforce from lsi to seagate this is an interesting move to me
[4893.14 --> 4900.98]  yeah where it feels like because sandforce it's it's kind of like indelinks okay ssd controller makers
[4900.98 --> 4907.86]  come and go yeah and popularity rises and falls indelinks went from being a hot item with the barefoot
[4907.86 --> 4914.50]  controller to being acquired by ocz to releasing barefoot 2 which i think ocz was hoping well not
[4914.50 --> 4921.06]  i think lcz was hoping to leverage by selling the controllers and the technology to other ssd makers
[4921.06 --> 4926.18]  but then their new controller wasn't good enough and they just completely fell off the face of the earth
[4926.18 --> 4931.46]  and i shouldn't say not good enough the the latest indelinks stuff and not necessarily the controller
[4931.46 --> 4937.30]  hardware but the software the technology is not actually terrible it just isn't groundbreaking enough in
[4937.30 --> 4942.02]  a market that is full of a bunch of stuff that performs pretty much the same so i'm looking at
[4942.02 --> 4946.02]  this going just because sandforce is a big deal yesterday and a big deal today doesn't mean that
[4946.02 --> 4952.90]  it matters at all tomorrow and sf 3700 series has been delayed multiple times now i mean we were first
[4952.90 --> 4962.50]  shown it like what computex last year so yeah and it doesn't exist yet um i just wonder if ella if sandforce is
[4962.50 --> 4967.62]  being shuffled around because they just got nothing yeah i wouldn't be surprised i'm kind of surprised
[4967.62 --> 4973.86]  seagate bought them yeah it's just kind of weird well seagate's gotten into ssds i mean they've got
[4973.86 --> 4979.06]  their own branded ssds now yeah but are they really pushing them maybe this is their whole goal is now
[4979.06 --> 4984.66]  they'll maybe push them really hard the thing about an ssd is the controller actually isn't a huge part of
[4984.66 --> 4990.02]  the the bomb cost or or really a huge selling point to me at this point i mean samsung i don't understand why
[4990.02 --> 4995.86]  they bought it samsung went hero mode when they went okay like because flash isn't a big differentiating
[4995.86 --> 4999.86]  factor because there's only a few makers of flash and no one else is going to get into that business
[4999.86 --> 5005.22]  without a massive investment that makes no sense so flash doesn't differentiate controllers don't make
[5005.22 --> 5010.50]  much of a difference these days it's coming down to features like hardware encryption and all that stuff
[5010.50 --> 5016.26]  that's on evo data loss protection and it's coming down to software stuff like what samsung did with evo
[5016.26 --> 5020.66]  where they basically went yeah we know our ssd is a commodity so we're going to build this cool
[5020.66 --> 5025.22]  software that lets you use your ram to cash it yeah and we're going to have this like great cloning
[5025.22 --> 5030.10]  software that allows you to clone onto a smaller drive because that's what a lot of people will be
[5030.10 --> 5035.70]  doing and then have it overflow elsewhere so i don't really see the point of spending 450 million when
[5035.70 --> 5041.22]  they could have spent 450 million trying to come up with some ideas for how to deliver value adds on the
[5041.22 --> 5048.66]  ssd that they already have unless they and like i just and and yeah whatever i mean it wouldn't be
[5048.66 --> 5052.26]  the first time i didn't understand something and it turns out to be a great idea yeah i don't really
[5052.26 --> 5056.42]  get this one unless there's something new in the pipeline or unless they're planning something weird
[5056.42 --> 5061.14]  i'm not really sure so there you go all right twitter blitz time
[5061.14 --> 5071.46]  um if it decides to allow us yeah if it ever actually loads there we go all right having a
[5071.46 --> 5082.58]  garage sale today i'm hungry i have food okay uh yeah sure why not i think i have a 780 so stay tuned for
[5082.58 --> 5088.90]  that what what what what why are you selling 780 what one what what what what what hold on 780 just
[5088.90 --> 5097.22]  calm down uh direct c u2 okay that's fine why what 780 are you upset about i just want to make sure
[5097.22 --> 5102.18]  you're not taking like one of my benching ones oh no or just one of the reference ones in general
[5102.18 --> 5110.10]  okay why are you all green uh a little green aren't we that means oh like you oh i don't know the window
[5110.10 --> 5115.06]  the window's open and the sunlight is bright and there's grass outside yeah that's the best guess
[5115.06 --> 5122.26]  i have yeah 4.1 gigahertz new haswell okay um you know what's funny is we actually made it all the
[5122.26 --> 5126.58]  way through the show without talking about titan z being available now but like and without talking
[5126.58 --> 5132.18]  about any of the new haswell stuff which is kind of funny titan z is in my mind the least relevant
[5132.18 --> 5137.46]  thing to the viewers of our show ever unless you're a kuda developer it's totally irrelevant we don't
[5137.46 --> 5143.38]  recommend it unless you're a good developer titan z just straight up makes no sense for gamers so
[5143.38 --> 5152.10]  the doc yeah ouch uh do you have a tutorial on how to build a pc for first timers uh yes many in
[5152.10 --> 5160.18]  fact we have the hands down best tutorials on youtube for how to build a pc and more than one too
[5160.18 --> 5164.58]  so if you're like oh this part maybe wasn't super clear you can just watch another one and we have
[5164.58 --> 5169.22]  nice little time stamps for each individual part and you can jump around in the video and find
[5169.22 --> 5173.38]  exactly what you're having trouble installing i've actually heard i have a buddy that it's oh i clicked
[5173.38 --> 5180.34]  new atv gross not that one that's not a go away go away go back eli the computer guy even okay i don't
[5180.34 --> 5188.98]  even know what you're doing okay if you search for seriously there uh this one's really good the 1500
[5188.98 --> 5195.94]  gaming one is really pc build guide why don't we go with that yeah it's all in how you optimize your
[5195.94 --> 5202.50]  keywords because now it's like all us so this one's really good the one with a million views um which
[5202.50 --> 5208.42]  is one's pretty good uh this one's really good if you're doing like a basic machine the kaveri build
[5208.42 --> 5214.18]  guide uh we have a water cooled one here's if you're building a small form factor so we cover a lot of
[5214.18 --> 5218.58]  tricks there we've also got another amd value one that's mostly if you're building something a little
[5218.58 --> 5225.86]  bit lower end and then overkill if you're doing liquid cooling you're gonna want this one so i hope
[5226.42 --> 5232.34]  addresses that next i guess we're gonna be having a mineral oil one coming maybe it depends yeah it
[5232.34 --> 5240.82]  depends are you excited for this year's e3 um i'm excited that i don't have to go i'm hoping i get to
[5240.82 --> 5245.62]  check out ubisoft i'm because i want to look into like assassin's creed and far cry 4 and whatever
[5245.62 --> 5251.14]  else they might be working on like uh what's it called not driver the crew um i'm excited for 2k
[5251.14 --> 5255.22]  because i want to see that new civilization game which looks amazing i think it's called beyond earth
[5255.78 --> 5261.94]  um i'm excited to check out nintendo because they're doing that crazy like what is that new the new uh
[5261.94 --> 5270.02]  zelda franchise game oh i can't remember what it's called it's like hyrule hyrule hyrule basketball no are
[5270.02 --> 5274.10]  they gonna are they gonna whore out link the same way they have mario no no no it's it's like
[5274.10 --> 5279.94]  it's called hyrule warriors or something it looks really cool but no not basketball or golf or anything
[5279.94 --> 5286.18]  like that yeah i got i got the ebay email as well uh idea for t-shirt with the word wanger no i don't
[5286.18 --> 5292.50]  think we need a t-shirt with the word wanger what are your opinions on gamecube that's actually
[5292.50 --> 5297.14]  really cool that probably should have made it yeah you can play the new the upcoming super smash
[5297.14 --> 5303.06]  brothers with your gamecube controller using an adapter for the wii u that is like really cool
[5303.06 --> 5310.10]  actually yeah and like everyone is in love with that uh have you played watchdogs i have not played
[5310.10 --> 5316.02]  it um i do have a copy i don't know if i would classify what i did as playing it you benchmarked it
[5316.02 --> 5320.34]  yeah but i didn't really get to experience the game hello what is the highest end gpu i can run
[5320.34 --> 5324.42]  with before but okay go watch my uh fastest possible on bottlenecking because it doesn't really
[5324.42 --> 5331.30]  work that way um sup watching the stream from my macbook bro bro bro do you see game consoles ever
[5331.30 --> 5337.14]  equaling pcs for price to performance yeah they're pretty much there right now ps4 is very competitive
[5337.14 --> 5342.10]  price to performance wise with a low-end pc xbox one maybe not so much yeah maybe not a ps4 yeah
[5342.66 --> 5347.54]  computex maxwell releases i don't know i have to leave but i'm waiting for one question that i have to
[5347.54 --> 5353.54]  answer what would you recommend sly nope single 780 single 780 are you getting the razer blade 14 soon yes
[5354.50 --> 5359.46]  uh they've finally confirmed we are getting one soon what drink do you get at tim hortons chocolate
[5359.46 --> 5365.54]  milk really you go to every time you go to tim hortons to get chocolate milk i don't drink coffee
[5365.54 --> 5372.18]  right but no it's like why would you go if everyone's going to tim hortons oh and then i'm like i want to
[5372.18 --> 5376.50]  get like a meal or whatever okay chocolate milk with it because there's like nothing else there i don't
[5376.50 --> 5381.22]  want to get pop i like the lemon iced tea i didn't even know they had that but yeah i know i'd probably
[5381.22 --> 5385.22]  still get chocolate milk chocolate milk is pretty much the best thing that ever happened to humanity
[5387.22 --> 5389.54]  let's not debate that because that happens immediately
[5392.74 --> 5396.90]  opinion on ios 8 being confirmed i think that it's not very unexpected
[5396.90 --> 5403.62]  it's another mobile operator yeah it's gonna be like the other one except slightly more different
[5403.62 --> 5409.22]  you probably could have confirmed ios 8 on like ios 4. it's like it's gonna come at some point
[5411.70 --> 5417.54]  um bye everyone any idea how valve will address the issue of windows games not working on linux well
[5417.54 --> 5421.70]  there's not a whole lot they can do it's up to the individual developers whether or not they make the
[5421.70 --> 5427.70]  game work on linux is home streaming the only option home streaming is a fantastic option if
[5427.70 --> 5432.10]  that's the only option who cares that's a great option there's services like wine and stuff you
[5432.10 --> 5436.10]  have to go get out of here which can make windows games work on linux i'm tired of you
[5436.10 --> 5441.54]  they'll technically build something better if they wanted to bye all right what do you think about the
[5441.54 --> 5446.98]  titans i think i already answered that one since we can join multiple groups now people are just
[5446.98 --> 5451.54]  joining whatever and getting email invites for explore that's interesting i guess that's what's going on
[5451.70 --> 5461.86]  there i got 99 problems but a g750 jay-z ain't one uh dimitru asks why no 1080p for the lan show archive
[5461.86 --> 5468.34]  great question uh we switched from streaming at 1080 to 720 back when we were having bandwidth cap issues
[5468.34 --> 5474.98]  with our isp um there is actually technically no reason why we couldn't stream at 1080 now and then the
[5474.98 --> 5481.06]  archive would be at 1080 all right so i think let's call that pretty much it for the wan show today thank
[5481.06 --> 5486.74]  you guys very much for tuning in i thought this was a pretty good show i hope you guys agreed thanks
[5486.74 --> 5494.42]  again to our sponsors asus powered by the g750 jay-z all two of them wow there it is there's the other
[5494.42 --> 5500.26]  one with that matte black and that shiny logo and all that good stuff and i'm going to tease it again we
[5500.26 --> 5505.30]  do have another really exciting project planned with asus in the next little while it's funny because we
[5505.30 --> 5511.54]  didn't do anything with asus for the first entire year that linus media group existed and now we're
[5511.54 --> 5516.42]  like we've got like sponsoring the wan show and we got this really cool upcoming project you guys are
[5516.42 --> 5521.54]  going to be pretty stoked on it trust me and uh big thanks to modus for also sponsoring the wan show
[5521.54 --> 5527.86]  today don't miss geek stakes facebook.com slash modus for canadian and u.s residents go ahead over there
[5527.86 --> 5534.42]  make sure you're in the draws they do a new draw for a new sweet geek prize every day to celebrate geek pride day
[5534.42 --> 5537.22]  peace out guys i'll be back in a moment
[5541.38 --> 5544.10]  seriously okay well whatever
[5544.10 --> 5557.38]  i don't even know what these things are
[5558.26 --> 5572.90]  turn it off
[5574.10 --> 5583.22]  okay
[5583.94 --> 5586.10]  you
[5588.26 --> 5591.06]  too
