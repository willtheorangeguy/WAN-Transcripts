[0.00 → 2.74] And then we've got a great show planned for you today.
[3.34 → 6.28] We decided to do, well, not decided.
[6.96 → 11.12] We had to fulfill one of the stretch goal targets for our new office campaign.
[11.56 → 13.36] So Linus is...
[13.36 → 14.30] I'm Mother Teresa.
[14.52 → 18.64] We promised we would, basically we promised we would do the WAN show dressed up as ladies.
[18.78 → 20.92] So we each chose a lady to dress up as.
[20.96 → 22.50] I went with Mother Teresa.
[22.88 → 24.78] So I got my habit here.
[25.20 → 25.46] Yep.
[25.80 → 28.12] Feeling pretty good about myself right now.
[28.12 → 30.36] And I went as Kaylee from Firefly.
[30.48 → 34.38] So this is supposed to be like her overalls.
[34.48 → 35.50] It's actually a sweater.
[35.62 → 36.86] But it's supposed to be her overalls.
[36.94 → 40.60] And then I have my like flowered shirt and not my normal hair.
[41.56 → 42.32] And there's a hood on it.
[42.32 → 44.50] There's a hood, which I don't think there normally is.
[44.60 → 45.64] But whatever, don't worry about it.
[46.22 → 47.26] They cut the sleeves off.
[47.42 → 47.66] That's it.
[47.66 → 49.74] The worst costume ever.
[49.80 → 51.10] You know what the weirdest thing is right now?
[51.54 → 51.98] Lipstick.
[52.22 → 52.86] Holy crap.
[53.34 → 54.66] Yeah, it's kind of awful, isn't it?
[54.66 → 55.58] It's horrible.
[55.58 → 59.10] Well, Nick got lip gloss for me because I'm a little more modest.
[60.94 → 63.60] So I don't just go all out with the lipstick.
[63.70 → 65.16] She probably didn't put anything on.
[65.34 → 68.96] So guys, here's the crowdfunding campaign page.
[69.32 → 73.04] So I think the current goal we're working on is for...
[73.04 → 73.16] Oh.
[76.10 → 77.48] You're such a noob.
[78.46 → 78.78] Okay.
[79.04 → 79.58] Well...
[80.86 → 81.46] You're a noob.
[81.46 → 82.64] There.
[82.78 → 84.02] I muted my computer.
[84.48 → 87.12] So I think the current goal that we're working on...
[87.12 → 91.62] We actually just uploaded the Shock Callers Channel Super Fun video last week.
[92.10 → 94.70] Sancho made up his Paul and Kyle was last week.
[94.86 → 96.62] The old school unboxing is done.
[97.04 → 101.06] So Wingardium, get the F back to work, Luke, is the goal we're working on right now.
[101.06 → 104.06] So he's going to have a life-size cutout of Harry Potter.
[104.44 → 109.78] Daniel Radcliffe has Harry Potter in his room, and we'll put some funny speech bubble on him or something.
[110.00 → 113.72] And then the next one is going to be a Linus Tech Tips LAN hoodie.
[113.94 → 114.94] So there you go, guys.
[115.00 → 116.96] It's newoffice.linustechtips.com.
[117.06 → 122.90] We've got a great show for you guys today, including Ghost Cars Now Becoming a Reality.
[122.90 → 130.76] And I don't mean ghost cars like cops, and then you get a ticket because you were doing something wrong, and you didn't realize they were a cop.
[131.18 → 134.56] We've also got Steam Games are now region locked.
[134.82 → 142.42] So there is a reason for this that goes beyond just Valve are bad people, and they want you to pay more for games.
[143.14 → 143.96] What else we got?
[144.66 → 146.76] Sorry, I was dealing with getting hair out of my mouth.
[146.88 → 148.70] I still don't understand how anyone does this.
[148.70 → 153.72] Eric Schmidt says there's nothing to worry about with AI because he doesn't understand things.
[153.80 → 154.84] We'll talk more about that later.
[155.00 → 155.10] Yep.
[155.30 → 158.88] And Sony versus GOP, also known as Guardians of Peace.
[158.96 → 160.94] There's been a ton of updates with that.
[161.10 → 163.18] Now, I'm a little confused.
[163.30 → 173.54] Is it Guardians of Peace, like the little small green things, or Guardians of Peace, like people not terrorizing each other?
[174.86 → 177.70] Guardians of Peace, but they don't necessarily define what peace.
[177.70 → 178.30] Part of it.
[178.30 → 178.58] Yeah.
[178.80 → 179.68] All I understand now.
[179.68 → 182.54] They're like, we are Guardians over part of the world.
[182.66 → 182.88] Get it?
[182.92 → 184.58] Oh my god, that actually makes so much sense.
[185.20 → 185.80] Intro time.
[190.40 → 192.14] I can't even deal with his hair right now.
[193.12 → 194.24] I literally can't deal with it.
[194.34 → 198.68] For what it's worth, the elastic on this habit headband thing is really tight.
[199.34 → 202.64] And like, I'm going to be doing this show without oxygen to my brain.
[202.64 → 203.64] All right.
[203.64 → 207.74] All right.
[207.74 → 212.04] So our sponsors today are the one and only Dollar Shave Club.
[213.04 → 214.94] Oh, that's so adorable.
[215.16 → 215.84] Look at that.
[215.84 → 218.34] They put little Christmas junks next to it.
[219.08 → 222.64] We have Christmas hats and a Christmas tree and a Christmas man.
[223.66 → 224.00] A Christmas?
[225.04 → 226.20] You don't call them Christmas men?
[226.44 → 226.88] Snowman.
[227.44 → 227.78] No.
[227.96 → 228.70] It's a snowman.
[228.92 → 229.58] Dollar Shave Club.
[229.72 → 230.10] Shave time.
[230.22 → 230.78] Shave money.
[231.06 → 231.78] Shave yourself.
[232.44 → 233.14] Shave a snowman.
[233.14 → 234.48] You look like you could use a shave.
[234.54 → 235.68] I could probably use a shave right now.
[235.68 → 237.72] If you're going to make that costume a little more convincing.
[237.92 → 238.14] Yeah.
[238.34 → 238.60] All right.
[238.64 → 239.90] We've also got Intel.
[240.22 → 243.52] Take advantage of fantastic holiday rebates.
[243.60 → 248.44] Also in tune with the holiday season with the Christmas hats and all that kind of stuff.
[248.46 → 250.00] This is also Christmassy.
[250.50 → 250.98] What's also...
[250.98 → 251.50] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[251.56 → 251.92] The lower thirds.
[251.92 → 252.80] The WAN Show logo has a Christmas hat.
[252.80 → 253.70] It's Christmassy and everything.
[253.84 → 254.06] I know.
[254.18 → 254.78] It's like...
[254.78 → 258.10] It's almost like we should have done this a couple of weeks ago in order to get our money's
[258.10 → 261.94] worth out of completely redoing all of our lower thirds and sponsor intros.
[262.08 → 263.06] Thanks, Nick Van Merkel.
[263.98 → 264.46] Exactly.
[265.90 → 266.54] All right.
[266.60 → 269.68] So why don't we just like kick things right off here.
[269.82 → 274.02] So ghost cars are becoming a reality thanks to Jaguar.
[274.12 → 275.62] So people should probably see this video.
[275.84 → 276.96] We should probably...
[276.96 → 277.12] Yeah.
[277.18 → 279.06] We should probably show you guys the video.
[279.64 → 284.60] Basically, the video is pure bullshit, but it's still worth watching just so that you
[284.60 → 292.22] can get some idea of what Jaguar wants you to believe is coming, even if it has really
[292.22 → 295.40] very little to do with what's actually going to be coming.
[295.40 → 298.76] My laptop is just like, yeah, maybe I can...
[298.76 → 298.78] Yay, laptop.
[298.78 → 301.06] Maybe I'll scroll a page eventually here.
[301.18 → 301.76] There we go.
[302.16 → 304.68] Maybe I'll load this YouTube's...
[304.68 → 306.50] I got to stop this stream.
[306.64 → 307.04] What is it?
[307.08 → 307.98] What is it doing?
[307.98 → 308.04] What is it doing?
[308.56 → 311.36] Your laptop is just not a happy laptop right now.
[311.44 → 311.84] I know.
[312.20 → 313.50] This is not good.
[313.80 → 314.10] Okay.
[314.50 → 315.14] Thank you.
[315.44 → 316.26] Stop streaming.
[318.38 → 318.90] And...
[318.90 → 320.36] Start streaming.
[320.94 → 321.34] All right.
[321.40 → 321.52] Here.
[321.52 → 322.48] I'll show you guys this.
[322.60 → 322.96] Here we go.
[323.58 → 323.96] All right.
[324.06 → 327.98] So 360 degree urban...
[327.98 → 328.46] Windscreen.
[328.58 → 328.60] Windscreen.
[328.60 → 329.50] Windscreen.
[329.64 → 329.82] Okay.
[329.94 → 334.84] So basically, the concept they're trying to sell us here is that the pillars...
[334.84 → 341.78] So like this pillar here, for example, will be able to turn transparent by...
[341.78 → 346.80] Well, basically by replacing the top material here with screens so that you'll effectively
[346.80 → 348.24] be able to see through them.
[348.24 → 351.68] So you'd have cameras on the outside of the car, and then you'd have the pillars be covered
[351.68 → 353.16] in screens so you can kind of see through them.
[353.40 → 356.66] Now there are a couple of reasons that this just flat out, straight up won't work.
[356.74 → 361.44] And one of them is that the way that your eyes focus is going to change.
[361.48 → 366.52] So you won't just be able to look out the windshield and look to the left without refocusing
[366.52 → 369.78] your eyes on the pillar because the object will be much closer to you.
[369.84 → 371.00] So this is kind of cool too.
[371.06 → 374.62] You can see that they didn't want to spend too much on the VFX here.
[374.62 → 378.62] So they only had that go transparent for a very short period of time.
[379.78 → 380.78] I did kind of notice that too.
[380.86 → 384.06] But I think what it was actually trying to point out there is when you look at stuff,
[384.16 → 384.72] it will change.
[384.72 → 385.56] Yes, it will be.
[385.58 → 386.88] It's not always trying to be transparent.
[386.90 → 391.18] Which is yet another potential point of failure for something like this if it were to work.
[391.24 → 391.86] This one's cool.
[392.20 → 397.52] So the idea is that there's a ghost car in the same sense as when you're playing a racing
[397.52 → 397.90] game.
[398.20 → 399.06] There's a ghost car.
[399.12 → 400.12] You shouldn't race against it.
[400.12 → 402.04] I'm sure that's not what Jaguar is endorsing here.
[402.18 → 407.38] But the idea is that instead of your traditional turn by turn navigation, you just follow this
[407.38 → 409.68] like imaginary car in front of you.
[409.76 → 411.90] Which doesn't seem like a super great implementation.
[412.20 → 416.76] Like I'd almost wish that they went with the actual kind of racing game thing that I see
[416.76 → 420.88] a lot of racing games actually set up, which is where they just show like the arrows around
[420.88 → 421.54] turns and stuff.
[421.64 → 421.74] Yeah.
[421.96 → 422.80] Lines on the road.
[422.96 → 423.62] Lines on the road.
[423.72 → 424.44] Arrows around turns.
[424.86 → 428.82] Show like show a grid on the road in front of you and be like, go along this curve.
[428.82 → 429.44] Something like that.
[429.52 → 432.22] Not a car in front of you, which usually represents nothing.
[432.60 → 437.14] And it just says like, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me repeatedly, which is going
[437.14 → 438.00] to get crazy annoying.
[438.04 → 442.94] And the thing about a car in front of you is that you're, that means again, it's an eye
[442.94 → 443.56] focused thing.
[443.60 → 445.68] You're looking right in front of you.
[445.74 → 447.96] That's a very myopic way to drive.
[447.96 → 452.88] That's not going to increase your situational awareness where looking further off into the
[452.88 → 456.10] distance is going to let you take better advantage of your peripheral vision.
[456.10 → 461.82] And it's going to allow you to spot hazards more easily on the road.
[462.06 → 464.30] And the car is intentionally right in front of you.
[464.40 → 468.06] The road lines and potentially arrows and stuff that Linus and I were just talking about
[468.06 → 471.98] are going to be kind of off to the side or below your main vision.
[472.12 → 475.68] So you'd see it out of your peripherals instead of it being the direct thing that you're looking
[475.68 → 475.90] at.
[475.94 → 477.96] So it shouldn't actually distract you from driving.
[478.32 → 481.56] That's another problem that I noticed with the pillars is unless they do like some pretty
[481.56 → 486.28] intense eye movement detection, a lot of times that you're looking at certain pillars, it
[486.28 → 487.78] might not know that you're actually looking at them.
[487.86 → 488.98] So it might not click in.
[490.16 → 493.32] This is, I don't know, I don't know what Twitch is doing.
[493.44 → 495.98] Your laptop, I think, is the problem.
[496.04 → 497.96] It's like a real problem though.
[498.08 → 500.28] So I was trying to participate in Twitch chat there.
[500.38 → 502.84] That did not happen.
[503.36 → 503.74] All right.
[503.74 → 506.70] So I think there's more people in Twitch chat saying that I'm prettier than you.
[507.04 → 508.48] So, well, I'm a nun.
[508.82 → 514.88] We're not supposed to be, you know, putting it on for everyone to see or something.
[515.22 → 516.16] Oh, oh, oh.
[516.48 → 521.04] Speaking of getting, putting it out there for everyone to see the channel super fun going
[521.04 → 524.30] up this weekend is freaking awesome.
[524.72 → 532.74] It involves, it, it does involve fake boobs, but not in any way that you could possibly be
[532.74 → 533.16] expecting.
[533.32 → 534.74] You will not see this coming.
[534.74 → 539.02] There's going to be that one dude who like guesses the exact thing.
[539.60 → 540.48] No, there isn't.
[540.62 → 541.06] Okay.
[542.18 → 543.24] No, I really don't.
[543.24 → 543.74] Challenge accepted.
[543.86 → 545.52] Everyone post on the forum what you think it's going to be.
[545.52 → 545.90] I sincerely.
[545.90 → 548.20] And then go watch the video and figure out if it's going to be it or not.
[548.68 → 549.46] Sincerely doubt it.
[549.68 → 550.08] All right.
[550.14 → 552.30] Let's go ahead and move into our next topic here.
[552.54 → 554.60] Oh, one thing that I want to talk about before we go forward.
[554.64 → 554.84] Hold on.
[554.94 → 558.12] X-Tank Slayer X was the one who posted the last topic on the forum.
[558.22 → 558.60] Thank you.
[558.76 → 560.00] I still want to talk about the last topic.
[560.00 → 565.36] So, um, with this kind of stuff coming to cars, more technology coming into cars now,
[565.62 → 570.46] I think it would be pretty cool if tech reviewers started reviewing cars.
[570.62 → 575.22] And I think car companies need to kind of figure this out too, because standard traditional
[575.22 → 581.04] car guys, when it's going to start coming to electrical cars and cars with beams that
[581.04 → 586.44] you can see through and projected cars on the road and 360 degree sonar and like all this
[586.44 → 589.48] other kind of stuff that cars are starting to get, I think they need tech guys on it.
[589.80 → 594.54] So at CES, I know I'm going to at least try to check out a couple cars and see if we can
[594.54 → 596.16] get some cool technology overviews.
[596.40 → 597.82] I'm not going to be looking into engines.
[598.30 → 601.40] I'm not going to be looking into anything like that, but I'll just look into like,
[601.48 → 603.76] oh, it has this cool tech or that cool tech.
[603.76 → 603.92] Yeah.
[603.98 → 609.42] Cars are, cars are becoming something that the typical gear head is not necessarily like
[609.42 → 614.62] they'll probably look at this kind of stuff the same way that, you know, a hardcore audio
[614.62 → 620.58] file is going to look at, you know, 3d positional software sound on something like a headset.
[620.70 → 621.34] Well, hold on a second.
[621.40 → 622.48] Like, does it sound good or not?
[622.62 → 624.20] These guys are going to be like, well, hold on.
[624.24 → 625.44] Does it handle well or not?
[625.50 → 630.80] Whereas guys like us are going to be like, yeah, like what OS is that Android dash system
[630.80 → 631.16] running?
[631.34 → 633.46] And how does it, I think we need kind of both teams here.
[633.46 → 636.72] Like they can, they can check out the engine and all that kind of stuff or the motor,
[636.82 → 638.44] I guess, depending on which anyway.
[640.08 → 641.10] Speaking of which.
[641.24 → 643.68] Speaking of cars not even needing engines anymore.
[644.50 → 645.10] All right.
[645.10 → 651.68] So our next topic here is the Assassin's Creed creator reveals a triple A historical action
[651.68 → 652.60] survival game.
[653.54 → 653.90] Wow.
[653.90 → 656.06] Just in case you haven't heard of one of those before.
[656.50 → 661.46] So this was posted on the forum by, I would love to tell you, but my laptop really is a
[661.46 → 662.90] broken piece of crap right now.
[662.90 → 664.02] This is supposed to be by.
[664.02 → 665.12] Rohit Kumar SP.
[665.46 → 665.68] Yeah.
[665.76 → 667.62] And the original article here is from Game Spot.
[667.68 → 668.88] Do you want to go ahead and drop that in the chat?
[669.08 → 669.62] Oh, yes.
[669.66 → 670.68] I forgot to do the last one.
[670.76 → 670.98] Okay.
[671.02 → 672.16] Maybe drop them both in there.
[672.18 → 673.90] Or I don't think you can do them back to back, can you?
[674.28 → 675.24] It's not a good idea.
[675.36 → 675.68] Okay.
[675.68 → 676.54] I will just do this one.
[676.88 → 677.10] Sure.
[677.88 → 678.20] Boom.
[678.28 → 678.82] There we go.
[679.16 → 679.46] All right.
[679.52 → 680.80] So, oh, we're looking at the dock.
[680.88 → 681.06] Not that.
[681.06 → 681.50] There we go.
[681.88 → 682.30] All right.
[682.30 → 684.82] So, Panache Digital Games.
[685.08 → 686.46] What's the scoop on this?
[686.46 → 690.20] So, this guy left after he didn't like the direction that AC was going.
[690.30 → 694.50] I believe this was after the series of AC2 games.
[694.58 → 696.80] So, after Ohio, I believe this is when he left.
[697.12 → 698.28] Someone might correct me on that.
[698.28 → 705.02] He then went to THQ, where he started to develop 1666, a new game fairly similar to Assassin's
[705.02 → 705.10] Creed.
[705.12 → 706.68] And we all know what happened to THQ.
[706.88 → 707.24] Yes.
[707.44 → 710.36] And then Ubisoft absorbed that portion of them.
[710.62 → 712.32] And he was working for them again.
[712.34 → 714.88] Taking 1666 and taking him back.
[715.24 → 719.84] He promptly left again and is now like, screw all you guys.
[720.20 → 722.16] I'm going to make my own freaking studio.
[722.54 → 724.20] So, has started Panache Games.
[724.40 → 725.72] I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[725.82 → 726.10] But, yeah.
[726.30 → 727.00] I think it's Panache.
[727.00 → 728.18] So, yeah.
[728.44 → 730.26] There's no official name for it yet.
[730.72 → 736.12] No one actually knows if he was able to buy back the IP of 1666 or any of that kind of
[736.12 → 737.82] stuff because I think he might have been trying.
[738.78 → 739.54] So, yeah.
[739.66 → 741.56] We know he's going to continue trying.
[741.76 → 742.88] Whether...
[742.88 → 744.94] This wig, man.
[745.26 → 750.08] Whether he has to restart completely, or he's able to continue on his previous work.
[750.16 → 754.00] By buying back the rights for 1666 or something along those lines.
[754.06 → 755.68] Whether it's going to be 1666.
[755.68 → 756.84] We don't know any of that kind of stuff.
[757.00 → 758.52] But, yeah.
[758.72 → 759.26] He's doing it.
[759.38 → 764.52] And he's referenced more than once that he thinks that positive change can happen throughout
[764.52 → 766.98] the world through video games, which I kind of actually do agree with.
[767.18 → 770.96] And he thinks a very good platform for that is AAA titles because they're very wide-reaching.
[771.52 → 776.84] And looking at how much I liked Assassin's Creed 2 and all of its iterations, I would be happy
[776.84 → 778.44] if he makes something to that calibre again.
[778.44 → 779.80] All right.
[780.28 → 783.88] So, this is fascinating.
[784.20 → 787.74] I always feel a little bit weird when we're reporting on our sponsors.
[787.74 → 788.10] Sponsors stuff?
[788.32 → 788.42] I know.
[788.42 → 792.18] Especially when it's positive because I feel like I should be trying to find something
[792.18 → 793.02] crappy about it.
[793.16 → 793.92] Well, it's not in Canada.
[793.92 → 794.36] Yeah.
[794.36 → 794.66] Yeah.
[794.72 → 795.38] That's crappy.
[795.58 → 795.86] Okay.
[795.96 → 796.14] There.
[796.24 → 800.22] The crappiest thing about this next news item is that I can't get it.
[800.60 → 803.42] So, the original article is on Tom's Hardware dot com.
[803.48 → 804.34] I don't know if you posted that yet.
[804.60 → 804.80] I'm just giving you a moment.
[804.80 → 809.18] And it was posted by Lucifer, Lucifer, whatever.
[809.50 → 810.54] It was posted on the forum.
[810.98 → 812.54] So, Ting dot com.
[812.66 → 818.28] You know those guys that they do some advertising through us for their mobile service where they
[818.28 → 820.32] actually buy wholesale.
[820.88 → 827.56] They buy wholesale from Sprint, and then they resell on like a pay per use sort of plan with
[827.56 → 832.26] their customers instead of asking people to sort of commit to X number of minutes per
[832.26 → 832.94] month or whatever else.
[832.94 → 841.06] So, they've got their whole mobile thing going on, and now they are expanding their service
[841.06 → 843.48] to provide gigabit internet.
[844.50 → 846.04] How fascinating.
[846.40 → 851.36] So, they jumped in on a company by which I think they jumped in at like 70% of Blue Ridge
[851.36 → 854.72] Networks and Blue Ridge Networks was already offering gigabit internet.
[854.72 → 862.84] But it was 100 megabit per second and 50 megabits per second down, 50 megabits per second up for
[862.84 → 864.38] around $500.
[864.94 → 870.34] And the new tier should be that same kind of deal but around $100 a month which is pretty
[870.34 → 871.14] insane actually.
[871.42 → 872.18] So, hold on a second.
[872.32 → 876.66] According to Blue Ridge's announcement, the company will have pricing plans for gigabit internet
[876.66 → 878.78] with rates under $100.
[878.78 → 879.78] Oh, okay.
[879.78 → 883.90] With budget oriented plans that could be even lower than the initial offering.
[883.90 → 888.78] Additionally, Blue Ridge will honour prices and certain plans for a limited time for customers
[888.78 → 891.00] who upgrade to Ting internet.
[891.00 → 892.92] Pretty awesome.
[893.30 → 897.66] The company also has plans to provide a television package in 2015 as well.
[898.98 → 900.18] How interesting.
[900.62 → 909.06] Looks like if you sit on your ass and don't upgrade infrastructure, other people who think
[909.06 → 915.50] that that money that you were making looks pretty good might actually invest and compete
[915.50 → 916.00] with you.
[916.62 → 917.98] Whoa, AT&T.
[918.80 → 920.54] Holy actual crap.
[920.54 → 925.02] And with the pricing structure that Ting is setting up, like, please just wreck AT&T.
[925.02 → 929.64] And one fascinating thing too is right when this happened, a bunch of people
[929.64 → 935.78] local around Blue whatever networks have now shown interest in the Ting one, Blue Ridge
[935.78 → 939.24] internet works, because it's much cheaper.
[939.62 → 941.52] So, it's showing that like people are interested.
[941.94 → 945.46] AT&T being like, why do you guys need above 6 megabits per second?
[945.86 → 946.90] Because people want it.
[947.00 → 948.76] Because the internet shouldn't be slow anymore.
[948.90 → 949.80] It doesn't make any sense.
[950.54 → 951.82] So, yeah.
[952.02 → 960.14] I mean, it really does feel like companies should be able to understand that we've seen
[960.14 → 963.42] this happens over and over and over again.
[963.80 → 968.02] I mean, when's the last time that you bought Fuji film?
[968.02 → 970.50] It's like Kodak.
[970.50 → 971.22] It's like Kodak.
[971.30 → 972.56] What happened to Kodak?
[973.18 → 976.34] We think digital is a phase.
[976.42 → 977.14] It's going to pass.
[977.22 → 978.08] They said that.
[978.50 → 980.20] We think it's a fad.
[980.56 → 982.38] It's like, okay, well, where are you today?
[982.38 → 989.80] It's like if you sit there and do not invest in whatever people are actually wanting to buy.
[989.86 → 995.60] If you're content to sit there on ass, not innovating, waiting for, you know, government.
[995.60 → 996.96] Like, when's the last time?
[997.02 → 997.40] You know what?
[997.46 → 1002.72] We can complain all we want about sort of government-sanctioned monopolies and all that kind of stuff.
[1003.12 → 1005.52] But eventually, they all fail.
[1005.52 → 1014.04] Eventually, competition does happen, even if it takes a little while, even if it takes a new technology in order for it to happen,
[1014.12 → 1022.56] or even if it takes municipalities going and building their own infrastructure for their own residents to have better access to the services that they want.
[1023.22 → 1028.50] Sitting there and refusing to innovate has never worked for anyone ever.
[1028.72 → 1029.88] Someone will come in and crush you.
[1029.90 → 1029.92] Not once.
[1030.20 → 1032.36] It happened with Apple and Microsoft.
[1032.36 → 1035.76] Apple and Microsoft stepped up in a range where no one was actually...
[1035.76 → 1037.94] It was like, oh, yeah, people don't need consumer computers.
[1038.08 → 1044.08] And then look at, like, two massive companies nowadays because they stepped up and decided they were going to do something about it.
[1044.90 → 1047.72] So, yeah, best of luck to you, Ting.
[1047.96 → 1049.50] Sure wish that you would...
[1049.50 → 1051.50] Come to freaking Canada, because aren't you from here?
[1053.36 → 1054.26] What the hell?
[1055.18 → 1055.58] Yeah.
[1055.58 → 1063.26] So, anyway, so, right, so their ISP expansion will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of Charlottesville, Virginia.
[1063.78 → 1065.32] So, lucky you guys.
[1065.44 → 1071.96] I can't wait till we have faster offerings here, even at the new place that we're looking to move into.
[1071.96 → 1081.42] The only plans that we have available are business versions of the same residential class connection speed, except you get a couple IPs.
[1081.74 → 1084.90] And I think a better uptime guarantee or something like that.
[1085.70 → 1088.56] I think they're just, like, give you some of your money back if they go down.
[1088.92 → 1091.28] It's like, oh, okay, well...
[1091.28 → 1092.86] But you just charged me more.
[1092.92 → 1093.18] Yeah.
[1093.36 → 1094.52] For the same service.
[1095.78 → 1096.60] Not better.
[1098.02 → 1099.62] Anyway, are we going to tackle this big one now?
[1099.82 → 1100.68] Yeah, sure.
[1100.68 → 1101.80] Why don't we jump right into this?
[1101.82 → 1105.72] So, this was posted by AlexP10v2 on the forum.
[1106.08 → 1107.24] Original articles here.
[1107.36 → 1109.00] The Verge has been doing a lot of coverage of this.
[1109.08 → 1112.22] We've also got Gizmodo and NPR on here.
[1112.30 → 1113.50] And, like, everyone else.
[1113.50 → 1122.28] And everyone and their dog, because this is so much deeper than tech news or movie news or anything.
[1122.96 → 1123.36] So, um...
[1123.36 → 1126.60] This is, like, basically every realm of news you could possibly imagine.
[1126.60 → 1127.60] Yeah, political...
[1127.60 → 1128.80] Politics, tech...
[1128.80 → 1131.40] Politics and tech.
[1131.58 → 1132.12] Maybe two.
[1132.48 → 1133.04] Um, anyway.
[1133.36 → 1134.20] So...
[1134.20 → 1136.64] The GOP has, quote-unquote, won.
[1136.76 → 1138.28] The interview has been pulled.
[1138.72 → 1140.86] Uh, not only because of Sony.
[1141.00 → 1143.66] A lot of different movie theatres, uh...
[1143.66 → 1146.60] Have publicly said that they would not show it.
[1146.76 → 1148.30] Even if it wasn't pulled by Sony.
[1148.30 → 1156.72] Now, that isn't to say that there was a very large amount of smaller, maybe independent-level movie theatres that weren't willing to show it.
[1156.78 → 1158.40] And actually asked to show it.
[1158.40 → 1162.34] I know George R.R. Martin actually offered up his own theatre.
[1163.02 → 1163.90] And was like, yes!
[1164.34 → 1165.06] Show it here!
[1165.18 → 1165.48] Please!
[1165.66 → 1166.84] You guys are cowards!
[1166.94 → 1167.78] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1167.92 → 1170.14] It's George R.R. Martin, so he obviously didn't pull any punches.
[1170.14 → 1172.86] Um, and was like, yes!
[1172.98 → 1174.02] Show it at my theatre, please!
[1174.36 → 1177.22] Even if it's a terrible movie, I will continue showing it.
[1177.48 → 1178.26] It doesn't matter.
[1178.72 → 1179.24] Um...
[1179.24 → 1180.00] So, you skipped a step.
[1180.14 → 1188.04] This is in response to the hackers basically threatening terror attacks anywhere where the movie was shown, including the premiere.
[1188.04 → 1195.20] And warning that even if you live nearby, you better go away anytime that the video is being shown.
[1195.32 → 1201.02] They actually referred to the September 11th, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center.
[1201.62 → 1204.08] So, uh, so big deal overall.
[1204.52 → 1206.04] And I understand...
[1206.60 → 1208.70] I understand pretty much every angle, actually.
[1208.98 → 1210.02] Like, it makes sense.
[1210.10 → 1215.10] You don't want to have your employees personal lives get screwed up.
[1215.10 → 1215.70] You don't want to endanger your employees.
[1215.70 → 1218.08] Because that's one big thing that the GOP has been attacking.
[1218.24 → 1222.58] We will release, like, I don't know if this is the right terminology, but SIN number, like your social insurance...
[1222.58 → 1223.26] I don't know what it is.
[1223.32 → 1224.24] Social security number.
[1224.42 → 1225.22] Yeah, that one.
[1225.82 → 1225.88] Um...
[1225.88 → 1226.62] Yeah, they did.
[1226.74 → 1230.08] They released the social security numbers, home addresses, previous salaries.
[1230.44 → 1231.72] It's bad for your employees.
[1231.92 → 1233.76] It's bad for people that you work with.
[1233.80 → 1234.84] It's bad for your own company.
[1234.94 → 1236.82] It's very, very bad.
[1237.30 → 1241.56] Um, and movie theatres were essentially being threatened to be blown up.
[1241.56 → 1241.96] Yeah.
[1241.96 → 1244.84] Because the GOP is like, if you go there,
[1244.84 → 1245.86] you're putting yourself at risk.
[1245.86 → 1248.10] If you live near there, you should leave your home.
[1248.46 → 1250.18] Like, they're being pretty serious.
[1250.36 → 1251.76] As a company that owns a movie theatre,
[1251.86 → 1255.92] you probably don't want your entire massive investment to be blown up because you showed one movie.
[1256.12 → 1256.32] Yep.
[1256.40 → 1257.14] I get all that.
[1257.16 → 1261.22] You don't want your customers to die because they came to a movie at your theatre.
[1261.34 → 1262.50] Like, I get it.
[1262.66 → 1262.86] Yep.
[1262.86 → 1264.88] But, with that said,
[1265.02 → 1267.18] so I don't remember who was first,
[1267.32 → 1271.22] but basically the major theatres pulled out kind of one by one,
[1271.34 → 1273.24] and then when enough of them pulled out,
[1273.36 → 1274.72] Sony pulled the whole thing.
[1275.20 → 1277.92] And the problem with this is that
[1277.92 → 1280.54] had everyone showed it,
[1280.92 → 1283.16] and had everyone gone to see it,
[1283.26 → 1285.30] there would have been no way for the GOP
[1285.30 → 1287.28] to attack that many targets.
[1287.28 → 1289.20] So, solidarity, one way or the other,
[1289.26 → 1292.24] it was total victory or total loss in this case.
[1292.68 → 1296.40] And there's an update from today, actually.
[1296.56 → 1299.78] Obama has criticized Sony for cancelling the release,
[1300.18 → 1301.18] calling it a mistake.
[1301.62 → 1304.90] We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace
[1304.90 → 1308.32] can start imposing censorship here in the United States.
[1308.78 → 1310.90] So, the president in his year-end news conference
[1310.90 → 1313.52] added that he was sympathetic about their concerns,
[1313.70 → 1314.14] but said,
[1314.22 → 1316.08] I wish they would have spoken to me first.
[1316.08 → 1319.86] because this is not just about Sony at this point.
[1319.98 → 1321.66] This is about, like he said,
[1321.90 → 1324.28] some dictator, some place,
[1324.68 → 1327.24] basically saying what movie you can or cannot
[1327.24 → 1329.64] put in your theatre in the United States of America,
[1329.80 → 1332.16] which is, wow.
[1332.80 → 1336.88] There was a very thinly veiled thread in response
[1336.88 → 1338.64] saying that the United States
[1338.64 → 1341.22] might have to find some way to respond in kind.
[1341.42 → 1342.34] At the same time,
[1342.34 → 1345.64] this happened and is very true,
[1345.64 → 1346.92] I'm sure they will at some time.
[1347.76 → 1349.18] But where is it in here?
[1349.68 → 1350.72] I can't find it in here.
[1350.80 → 1352.34] But there's somewhere else at the same time
[1352.34 → 1352.78] where they're saying,
[1352.90 → 1356.42] this also might have been designed to provoke an attack,
[1356.46 → 1358.66] and we have to be aware about that at the same time.
[1359.02 → 1360.80] So, they know this.
[1361.02 → 1361.20] Yeah.
[1361.28 → 1362.48] They're being aware of that,
[1362.54 → 1363.66] which I think is perfect.
[1363.80 → 1363.98] Yeah.
[1363.98 → 1365.82] Because it was very likely that it was intended
[1365.82 → 1367.12] to provoke something.
[1368.34 → 1369.64] I must have been trying to do something.
[1370.90 → 1372.52] This is a hideous situation.
[1372.74 → 1377.02] I know places like T-Fury are massively capitalizing on this.
[1377.40 → 1380.32] T-Fury's daily t-shirts right now are all about the interview.
[1381.22 → 1382.04] One of them is like,
[1382.08 → 1383.66] I wanted to go see a crappy movie,
[1383.74 → 1385.00] and now all I have is this t-shirt,
[1385.08 → 1386.30] and it shows Seth Rogen's face.
[1386.88 → 1388.12] The other one is like,
[1388.94 → 1390.66] I can't remember exactly how it goes,
[1390.76 → 1392.66] but I, for one, bow down to our new,
[1392.74 → 1394.04] beloved North Korean leaders,
[1394.60 → 1396.16] and it shows the interview stuff.
[1396.98 → 1397.58] Oh, wow.
[1398.00 → 1399.10] It's, yeah.
[1399.66 → 1401.70] I'm sure T-Fury's making a bunch of money off that,
[1401.74 → 1402.40] and that's why they did it,
[1402.44 → 1406.00] but it's interesting how spoken about this is,
[1406.04 → 1407.84] because it's a huge issue.
[1408.36 → 1410.22] I know George R. R. Martin brought up stuff like,
[1411.34 → 1413.14] I think this was kind of during World War II,
[1413.26 → 1414.52] although I don't know a ton about this,
[1414.52 → 1416.14] but I think it was called The Dictator,
[1416.30 → 1418.00] and it was with Charlie Chaplin.
[1418.46 → 1419.32] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1419.38 → 1421.06] Yeah, okay, and they still screened that.
[1421.42 → 1421.56] Yeah.
[1421.82 → 1425.36] I don't know if that's necessarily 100% of a fair comparison.
[1425.64 → 1427.26] Yeah, I haven't seen The Dictator, unfortunately.
[1427.26 → 1428.42] I haven't seen The Dictator.
[1429.56 → 1432.56] It's obviously a very different type of attack that's happening,
[1432.80 → 1433.78] Ada, Ada, Ada,
[1433.78 → 1435.42] but it is a very interesting comparison,
[1435.64 → 1437.16] and I do recommend that you go look up
[1437.16 → 1438.80] what George R. R. Martin has to say about this.
[1438.80 → 1442.70] And the big problem here is not what the GOP won today,
[1443.12 → 1445.76] because this just looks like a test.
[1445.76 → 1447.06] This almost doesn't matter.
[1447.18 → 1449.98] Yeah, it's just a stupid movie at the end of the day,
[1450.10 → 1451.92] but this looked like a test.
[1452.10 → 1456.70] Can we make these mega corporations bend to our will,
[1457.06 → 1459.32], and can we incite fear?
[1459.46 → 1460.28] I mean, it's terrorism.
[1460.46 → 1461.44] That's how terrorism works.
[1461.50 → 1462.64] If you're making people afraid,
[1462.76 → 1464.26] then you're effective.
[1464.26 → 1469.68] And so, basically, their message from today was,
[1470.02 → 1471.86] it's very wise you have made the decision
[1471.86 → 1473.54] to cancel the release of the interview.
[1473.70 → 1475.18] It will be very useful for you.
[1476.16 → 1478.12] We will ensure the security of your data
[1478.12 → 1479.92] unless you make additional trouble.
[1480.06 → 1481.66] And that's exactly the point.
[1481.66 → 1487.46] So now, Sony is completely under the thumb of the GOP forever.
[1488.74 → 1489.14] That's it.
[1489.24 → 1489.56] They won.
[1489.70 → 1489.80] Yep.
[1491.14 → 1494.68] And at some point, they're bound to do something,
[1495.02 → 1497.76] and that information will leak eventually.
[1498.14 → 1500.86] So they haven't safeguarded anything.
[1501.12 → 1501.46] Nope.
[1501.46 → 1502.66] All they've done is...
[1503.46 → 1504.12] Delayed the inevitable.
[1504.12 → 1506.48] ...enabled a round two later,
[1506.68 → 1509.70] as opposed to getting it all out in the open now.
[1509.70 → 1511.74] And, like, when you have people,
[1511.96 → 1513.36] like the President of the United States,
[1513.46 → 1513.94] being like,
[1514.08 → 1515.54] dude, just call me,
[1515.88 → 1517.30] you should probably do that,
[1517.40 → 1519.40] because they're going to step behind you a lot,
[1519.78 → 1522.10] because this is super important for...
[1522.10 → 1523.58] Even that might not be enough, though.
[1523.62 → 1525.86] I mean, there are so many issues
[1525.86 → 1528.42] with the information being leaked from Sony
[1528.42 → 1529.42] that have...
[1529.42 → 1531.16] that are nothing to do with anything
[1531.16 → 1532.88] Barack Obama can help with.
[1532.88 → 1533.70] Well, it's...
[1533.70 → 1535.40] A lot of it is going to be financial pain.
[1536.16 → 1536.44] Yeah.
[1536.52 → 1537.48] And you could help with that.
[1537.50 → 1538.68] There will be some financial pain,
[1538.68 → 1539.72] but the financial...
[1539.72 → 1540.00] Like, I mean,
[1540.02 → 1542.00] any support the United States is going to give
[1542.00 → 1543.20] is going to be temporary,
[1543.20 → 1546.22] and the impact on them as a company
[1546.22 → 1548.70] from all this information being leaked
[1548.70 → 1550.94] could last 10 years, 20 years.
[1551.68 → 1552.16] Like...
[1552.16 → 1553.84] It's one of the biggest deals
[1553.84 → 1555.54] that's happened politically in a long time.
[1555.70 → 1557.82] I'm pretty sure...
[1557.82 → 1559.06] Oh, chat wants the links.
[1559.06 → 1559.82] I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it.
[1559.86 → 1560.04] Sure.
[1560.18 → 1561.54] I'm pretty sure that
[1561.54 → 1564.30] they could step up appropriately.
[1565.04 → 1566.04] I doubt it.
[1566.04 → 1568.60] I personally completely disagree with that.
[1568.66 → 1570.08] I think that for them to...
[1570.08 → 1571.74] I mean, yes, I think they should have probably
[1571.74 → 1573.74] consulted with the U.S. government,
[1573.90 → 1575.74] but I don't think anything
[1575.74 → 1577.12] that they could have told them
[1577.12 → 1578.18] would have helped.
[1578.60 → 1580.48] It's not about what they could have told them.
[1580.56 → 1581.08] Or done anything.
[1581.08 → 1581.94] It has nothing to do with it.
[1582.10 → 1583.96] I mean, what are they going to do
[1583.96 → 1584.92] short of, you know,
[1584.98 → 1586.70] an airstrike on where the GOP
[1586.70 → 1587.60] is holding the data?
[1587.64 → 1588.20] It doesn't matter.
[1588.58 → 1589.68] The data's going to go out.
[1589.98 → 1590.36] Right.
[1590.36 → 1591.18] I know that.
[1591.50 → 1592.88] But what I mean is that
[1592.88 → 1595.10] nothing the U.S. said or did
[1595.10 → 1596.56] was going to change
[1596.56 → 1598.58] Sony's decision-making process here.
[1598.58 → 1598.78] It doesn't have to do...
[1598.78 → 1599.86] They just need to give them money.
[1600.78 → 1601.10] Right.
[1601.20 → 1602.24] But that's not going to...
[1602.24 → 1603.36] Okay, that's not going to change
[1603.36 → 1605.22] the impact of that data
[1605.22 → 1606.30] eventually being leaked.
[1606.56 → 1607.38] No one's going to want to...
[1607.38 → 1608.80] So don't go for an eventual leak.
[1608.92 → 1609.82] Drop it all now.
[1609.98 → 1611.82] Essentially consider all of those projects
[1611.82 → 1613.46] abandoned and then get financial support
[1613.46 → 1614.12] from the U.S. government.
[1614.12 → 1617.30] I think that's a very simplistic view
[1617.30 → 1619.22] and I really doubt that that is
[1619.22 → 1621.48] how that conversation would have gone down.
[1621.90 → 1624.60] A number of folks are calling for Sony
[1624.60 → 1626.66] to release the interview online.
[1627.52 → 1629.38] Sony Pictures CEO Michael Linton says
[1629.38 → 1631.14] that while Sony has every desire
[1631.14 → 1632.98] to release the film online
[1632.98 → 1634.78] isn't the immediate option.
[1635.06 → 1637.30] So we are considering some options
[1637.30 → 1638.92] as it stands right now.
[1638.92 → 1640.44] While there have been a number of suggestions,
[1640.68 → 1643.58] there has not been one major GOD distributor.
[1643.58 → 1644.70] So video on demand distributor.
[1645.08 → 1646.42] One major e-commerce site
[1646.42 → 1647.22] that has stepped forward
[1647.22 → 1647.98] and said they're willing
[1647.98 → 1649.72] to distribute the movie for us.
[1650.44 → 1653.40] So, wow.
[1653.96 → 1655.92] Again, we don't have that direct interface
[1655.92 → 1656.90] with the American public.
[1657.02 → 1657.90] I mean, one option,
[1658.22 → 1659.00] just throwing it out
[1659.00 → 1660.16] in case you're watching, Mike,
[1660.58 → 1662.82] would be the brand new
[1662.82 → 1664.40] BitTorrent paywall option.
[1665.76 → 1667.54] Hey, hey, you do have an interface
[1667.54 → 1668.94] directly with the American public.
[1669.02 → 1671.12] In fact, the public all over the world.
[1671.70 → 1671.98] All you have to do...
[1671.98 → 1672.88] It's hosted on a website.
[1672.88 → 1673.84] It really doesn't matter.
[1673.92 → 1674.78] All you have to do is...
[1674.78 → 1676.16] Well, no, I see what they mean.
[1676.22 → 1677.16] They probably don't have
[1677.16 → 1678.30] the infrastructure for that.
[1678.68 → 1680.62] Like, if a billion people
[1680.62 → 1682.04] hit that page at the same time...
[1682.04 → 1683.08] They host PSN.
[1683.48 → 1684.02] How do they not have
[1684.02 → 1684.42] the infrastructure for that?
[1684.42 → 1685.82] How often does PSN go down?
[1685.96 → 1686.86] Because of hackers.
[1687.26 → 1687.54] Right.
[1687.80 → 1689.72] So go behind someone else's wall.
[1689.88 → 1690.94] They've obviously been using
[1690.94 → 1692.08] AWS and other services.
[1692.38 → 1692.68] Okay.
[1693.18 → 1693.70] Yes.
[1694.02 → 1694.88] But...
[1694.88 → 1697.70] That's not a better option
[1697.70 → 1698.78] than just tormenting it.
[1698.78 → 1699.56] I...
[1699.56 → 1699.78] Okay.
[1700.10 → 1701.80] Because you can't attack a torrent.
[1701.80 → 1703.22] I wasn't saying it was a better option.
[1703.22 → 1703.80] Oh, okay.
[1704.34 → 1704.72] Because I...
[1704.72 → 1706.06] You're very aggressive right now.
[1706.46 → 1708.12] This is a simplistic view!
[1708.28 → 1709.24] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!
[1709.68 → 1711.10] Well, I really think it is.
[1711.50 → 1712.56] I think you're wrong as well,
[1712.62 → 1713.16] and that's okay.
[1713.28 → 1714.14] This is a talk show.
[1714.20 → 1715.10] We talk about things.
[1715.16 → 1715.88] Yes, we do.
[1715.94 → 1717.04] Calm down, Mr. Sir.
[1717.32 → 1717.76] All right.
[1717.86 → 1718.82] So what's our...
[1718.82 → 1720.12] I guess there's not...
[1720.12 → 1721.38] There's not really much else to say.
[1721.46 → 1722.28] The GOP won.
[1723.62 → 1725.46] There's the North Green stuff.
[1726.08 → 1726.68] Oh, yeah.
[1726.70 → 1726.98] Okay.
[1726.98 → 1727.84] There's like three...
[1727.84 → 1729.10] This was done in three topics.
[1729.34 → 1729.66] Right.
[1729.66 → 1730.02] For whatever reason.
[1730.38 → 1731.64] So I'm going to skim over one
[1731.64 → 1732.28] pretty quickly,
[1732.46 → 1733.60] which is Reddit has started
[1733.60 → 1733.82] banning users...
[1733.82 → 1734.78] Have you posted that link yet?
[1735.10 → 1735.54] Nope.
[1735.70 → 1735.90] Okay.
[1735.96 → 1737.12] This one was posted by
[1737.12 → 1738.50] XtankslayerX.
[1738.72 → 1740.12] Reddit has started banning users
[1740.12 → 1741.66] that are leaking some of the stuff
[1741.66 → 1743.74] that has been leaked from the GOP.
[1743.94 → 1745.12] So a Subreddit called
[1745.12 → 1746.66] Sony GOP was banned,
[1746.66 → 1748.10] and a moderator for that page
[1748.10 → 1749.58] called Sony GOP
[1749.58 → 1750.80] was also banned,
[1750.96 → 1751.58] and I'm sure there was
[1751.58 → 1752.36] other ones as well.
[1752.72 → 1754.22] This is not a new thing.
[1754.32 → 1755.38] This happened also during
[1755.38 → 1756.20] the happening
[1756.20 → 1757.02] where they closed
[1757.02 → 1758.00] certain stuff like that.
[1758.06 → 1758.80] They're not closing
[1758.80 → 1760.18] discussions about it.
[1760.50 → 1761.46] They're closing information
[1761.46 → 1763.20] that is leaked to do with this.
[1763.32 → 1764.46] Like not...
[1764.46 → 1764.68] Hmm.
[1764.84 → 1765.82] Information that is leaked
[1765.82 → 1766.58] from the GOP,
[1766.72 → 1767.54] they're getting rid of that,
[1767.78 → 1768.18] essentially.
[1768.48 → 1768.70] Yeah.
[1768.82 → 1769.84] So it's one of those things
[1769.84 → 1770.76] where, you know,
[1770.84 → 1773.02] Reddit is one of those...
[1773.02 → 1774.02] It's one of those places
[1774.02 → 1774.72] on the internet
[1774.72 → 1775.58] where there's not
[1775.58 → 1776.92] a whole ton of censorship,
[1777.14 → 1779.12] but I have to completely agree
[1779.12 → 1780.20] with what they're doing here.
[1780.62 → 1781.34] It seems like
[1781.34 → 1782.02] the only real
[1782.02 → 1783.22] appropriate response.
[1783.36 → 1784.18] You can't stop people
[1784.18 → 1785.04] from talking about it,
[1785.06 → 1785.72] and you shouldn't
[1785.72 → 1786.74] because it's really important,
[1787.24 → 1789.18] but you have to stop people
[1789.18 → 1790.58] from leaking
[1790.58 → 1791.86] the personal information
[1791.86 → 1793.02] of the people
[1793.02 → 1793.94] whose lives
[1793.94 → 1795.12] have been damaged
[1795.12 → 1796.12] by this incident
[1796.12 → 1796.76] that ultimately
[1796.76 → 1798.28] probably had
[1798.28 → 1799.96] nothing to do with them.
[1800.16 → 1800.58] Yeah.
[1800.58 → 1802.00] Nothing they did personally
[1802.00 → 1802.88] could have possibly
[1802.88 → 1803.38] merited...
[1803.38 → 1804.00] Considering how big Sony is
[1804.00 → 1804.58] and how many different
[1804.58 → 1805.32] things they do.
[1805.62 → 1805.78] Yeah.
[1805.88 → 1806.88] And the number of people
[1806.88 → 1808.00] whose information was leaked
[1808.00 → 1808.94] is far more
[1808.94 → 1809.62] than would have worked
[1809.62 → 1810.82] on an individual film.
[1811.00 → 1811.16] Yeah.
[1811.54 → 1812.54] Even possible
[1812.54 → 1813.22] for all these people
[1813.22 → 1813.78] to have worked on
[1813.78 → 1814.74] a single film, so...
[1814.74 → 1814.90] Yep.
[1817.10 → 1818.90] Now, I think the next one is...
[1818.90 → 1820.26] I believe it was the FBI,
[1820.48 → 1821.06] but there's a...
[1821.06 → 1821.94] Yeah, the FBI
[1821.94 → 1823.18] has essentially said
[1823.18 → 1824.96] that it was North Korea.
[1826.06 → 1826.38] Whoa.
[1826.54 → 1827.22] Hold on a second.
[1827.32 → 1828.08] Let's be clear.
[1828.08 → 1829.72] It was a group
[1829.72 → 1830.90] working on behalf
[1830.90 → 1832.38] of the North Korean government.
[1832.58 → 1832.74] Yeah.
[1833.58 → 1834.10] So...
[1834.10 → 1834.46] So...
[1834.46 → 1836.08] Some people have brought up...
[1836.08 → 1838.20] Yeah.
[1839.48 → 1840.16] There's people
[1840.16 → 1840.68] that have brought up
[1840.68 → 1841.08] different things...
[1841.08 → 1842.20] Don't like to change the topic.
[1842.72 → 1843.10] What do you mean
[1843.10 → 1843.90] change the topic?
[1844.98 → 1845.46] No!
[1846.18 → 1846.72] It's our show.
[1846.98 → 1847.20] Go.
[1848.46 → 1848.94] Wow.
[1849.40 → 1850.34] He is mad today.
[1851.24 → 1852.08] There's people
[1852.08 → 1852.94] that have brought up stuff
[1852.94 → 1854.64] like it's very easy
[1854.64 → 1855.54] to potentially
[1855.54 → 1856.64] translate your code
[1856.64 → 1857.90] to make it seem
[1857.90 → 1858.66] like you're someone else
[1858.66 → 1859.26] because something
[1859.26 → 1860.08] that they brought up
[1860.08 → 1861.60] was that some of the tools
[1861.60 → 1862.90] and the language
[1862.90 → 1863.96] and yada
[1863.96 → 1865.28] was in previous attacks
[1865.28 → 1866.44] against South Korea
[1866.44 → 1867.34] from North Korea.
[1867.54 → 1867.72] Right.
[1868.28 → 1869.32] But people brought up
[1869.32 → 1870.24] that you can try
[1870.24 → 1871.06] to masquerade
[1871.06 → 1871.92] as someone else.
[1872.02 → 1872.60] That's one of the best
[1872.60 → 1873.66] defences you can possibly
[1873.66 → 1874.60] have as a hacker.
[1876.10 → 1877.82] But I'm kind of assuming
[1877.82 → 1878.44] that the FBI
[1878.44 → 1879.86] probably has more information
[1879.86 → 1880.82] than other people,
[1881.16 → 1882.98] so they might know for sure.
[1883.44 → 1883.62] I don't know.
[1883.62 → 1884.06] Well, they're spying
[1884.06 → 1885.36] on absolutely everyone.
[1885.36 → 1885.48] Everyone.
[1885.48 → 1886.72] Not the FBI specifically,
[1886.72 → 1887.78] but I'm sure, you know,
[1888.22 → 1889.54] Joe at the FBI
[1889.54 → 1890.50] knows, like,
[1890.74 → 1892.12] Jim at the NSA.
[1892.12 → 1892.18] NSA.
[1892.46 → 1893.10] They have lunch
[1893.10 → 1893.70] and brunches
[1893.70 → 1894.16] and whatnot.
[1896.26 → 1897.02] Over tea
[1897.02 → 1898.08] and lipstick conversations.
[1898.20 → 1899.36] Now, anyone at the FBI
[1899.36 → 1900.24] whose name is Joe
[1900.24 → 1900.60] is like,
[1900.90 → 1901.34] Oh!
[1902.36 → 1903.44] How does Landis Act
[1903.44 → 1904.56] know about our brunches?
[1906.94 → 1907.78] Anyway, yeah.
[1907.88 → 1909.18] So that's not honestly,
[1909.76 → 1910.34] I don't think there's
[1910.34 → 1911.42] a ton to talk about that,
[1911.42 → 1912.40] but this is more,
[1912.64 → 1913.80] this has more information
[1913.80 → 1914.30] for, like,
[1914.80 → 1915.76] the states is planning
[1915.76 → 1917.66] to retaliate in some form.
[1917.88 → 1918.42] Proportional response.
[1919.10 → 1919.34] Yes.
[1919.52 → 1920.62] It's a national security,
[1920.72 → 1922.50] serious national security matter.
[1923.64 → 1923.96] Maybe,
[1924.20 → 1924.80] there may be,
[1925.14 → 1925.96] they may believe
[1925.96 → 1926.98] that a response from us
[1926.98 → 1927.92] in one fashion or another
[1927.92 → 1929.46] would be advantageous to them,
[1929.84 → 1930.78] so, you know,
[1930.84 → 1931.98] we're going to make sure
[1931.98 → 1933.34] we're treading carefully here.
[1933.72 → 1934.58] Deeply concerned
[1934.58 → 1936.08] about the destructive nature
[1936.08 → 1936.74] of this attack
[1936.74 → 1938.12] on a private sector entity
[1938.12 → 1939.78] and the ordinary citizens
[1939.78 → 1940.68] who work there.
[1941.58 → 1942.90] North Korea is attacking
[1942.90 → 1943.76] our infrastructure.
[1943.96 → 1944.66] It is also attacking
[1944.66 → 1945.38] our values.
[1945.70 → 1946.62] The decision to pull
[1946.62 → 1947.92] the interview from theatres,
[1948.06 → 1948.56] unfortunately,
[1948.78 → 1949.88] is a North Korean victory
[1949.88 → 1950.54] in its attacks
[1950.54 → 1951.18] on our freedom.
[1951.54 → 1952.42] We better respond
[1952.42 → 1953.58] comprehensively
[1953.58 → 1954.70] to defend freedom of speech
[1954.70 → 1955.98] in the face of terrorist threats
[1955.98 → 1956.80] and cyberattacks.
[1956.82 → 1957.46] Pretty intense.
[1957.58 → 1958.36] At the same time,
[1958.42 → 1959.12] this is where the note
[1959.12 → 1959.68] that I was looking for
[1959.68 → 1960.38] previously was,
[1960.62 → 1961.42] at the same time,
[1961.48 → 1961.84] they have noted
[1961.84 → 1962.66] that such attackers
[1962.66 → 1963.56] are often looking
[1963.56 → 1964.54] to provoke a response.
[1964.76 → 1964.88] Yep.
[1964.88 → 1965.56] So they're probably
[1965.56 → 1966.64] looking for a response
[1966.64 → 1967.28] and the United States
[1967.28 → 1967.78] is going to be
[1967.78 → 1968.46] giving them one,
[1968.70 → 1969.94] so they're going to,
[1970.34 → 1970.80] I guess,
[1970.92 → 1971.98] with that knowledge in mind,
[1972.06 → 1972.62] try to make sure
[1972.62 → 1973.52] that it is the most
[1973.52 → 1974.48] appropriate thing possible.
[1974.68 → 1975.44] It's going to be
[1975.44 → 1977.94] an interesting period of time.
[1978.08 → 1979.10] Yes, it is.
[1979.22 → 1980.06] And that last one
[1980.06 → 1981.12] was posted on the forum
[1981.12 → 1983.18] by XtankSlayerX.
[1983.30 → 1984.28] Did you post that in the chat?
[1984.38 → 1985.28] I did, yes.
[1985.40 → 1985.48] Okay.
[1985.48 → 1986.02] All right,
[1986.08 → 1986.74] so we've got
[1986.74 → 1988.90] our next topic here.
[1989.26 → 1990.26] It looks like we have
[1990.26 → 1991.82] every source for this topic
[1991.82 → 1994.36] other than the actual
[1994.36 → 1995.68] Valve page,
[1996.08 → 1997.32] so you'll have to
[1997.32 → 1998.24] forgive us for that.
[1998.68 → 2000.06] But Steam Games
[2000.06 → 2001.26] slash gifting
[2001.26 → 2003.46] is now region locked,
[2003.60 → 2004.64] due at least partially,
[2005.34 → 2006.60] due at least partially
[2006.60 → 2007.74] to the collapse
[2007.74 → 2009.26] of the Russian currency,
[2009.40 → 2009.90] the ruble.
[2009.90 → 2012.70] So I suspect that
[2012.70 → 2013.92] Valve's just been looking
[2013.92 → 2014.54] for an excuse
[2014.54 → 2015.98] to do this for quite some time
[2015.98 → 2019.36] because every other industry
[2019.36 → 2021.16] eventually figures out
[2021.16 → 2022.16] that if they want to have
[2022.16 → 2023.44] regionalized pricing,
[2023.76 → 2026.08] especially for a digital item,
[2026.26 → 2027.52] they're going to have
[2027.52 → 2029.20] to lock things down somewhat.
[2029.54 → 2030.86] It's still something
[2030.86 → 2031.92] that I,
[2032.18 → 2034.82] that I hate
[2034.82 → 2036.44] a lot,
[2036.64 → 2037.84] but I understand
[2037.84 → 2038.94] why they're doing it
[2038.94 → 2040.60] because you don't want
[2040.60 → 2042.30] gaming to just be
[2042.30 → 2043.76] completely unaffordable
[2043.76 → 2044.96] to anyone in Russia
[2044.96 → 2046.70] because Valve is a
[2046.70 → 2047.76] US-based company
[2047.76 → 2049.98] and they have to pay
[2049.98 → 2051.54] in their deteriorating
[2051.54 → 2052.40] ruble currency.
[2052.56 → 2053.40] But then you also
[2053.40 → 2054.32] don't want
[2054.32 → 2055.86] certain websites
[2055.86 → 2057.14] just reselling
[2057.14 → 2058.48] buckets and buckets
[2058.48 → 2059.00] of keys
[2059.00 → 2059.72] because they can get them
[2059.72 → 2060.76] super cheaply somewhere
[2060.76 → 2062.12] and sell them elsewhere
[2062.12 → 2063.10] where they're more expensive.
[2063.10 → 2063.76] Right.
[2064.56 → 2065.04] So,
[2065.40 → 2066.30] so this was going to
[2066.30 → 2067.12] happen eventually.
[2067.64 → 2068.92] I think that Valve
[2068.92 → 2070.32] has actually managed
[2070.32 → 2071.66] the potential
[2071.66 → 2073.20] community poop storm
[2073.20 → 2074.94] pretty darn well.
[2075.04 → 2075.20] I mean,
[2075.22 → 2076.24] it helps that Valve
[2076.24 → 2077.24] probably has,
[2077.44 → 2077.90] like,
[2078.08 → 2078.36] you know,
[2078.42 → 2079.16] It helps that it's happening
[2079.16 → 2080.00] during the winter sale.
[2080.96 → 2081.30] Yeah,
[2081.56 → 2081.86] yeah,
[2082.00 → 2082.26] yeah.
[2082.26 → 2082.66] Someone's like,
[2082.76 → 2083.06] yay,
[2083.16 → 2083.56] Valve!
[2083.66 → 2083.78] Oh,
[2083.84 → 2084.42] that thing happened.
[2084.54 → 2084.84] Yay,
[2084.98 → 2085.36] Valve!
[2085.58 → 2086.44] So they probably
[2086.44 → 2087.24] timed it right.
[2087.52 → 2088.62] Valve probably has
[2088.62 → 2089.52] a couple oopses
[2089.52 → 2090.22] in their pocket
[2090.22 → 2091.44] in terms of things
[2091.44 → 2091.98] the community
[2091.98 → 2092.68] is going to forgive
[2092.68 → 2093.22] them for
[2093.22 → 2093.76] if they,
[2093.84 → 2095.02] if they kind of
[2095.02 → 2095.74] screw them up.
[2096.02 → 2096.04] So,
[2096.04 → 2097.56] so basically Steam
[2097.56 → 2098.62] will no longer
[2098.62 → 2099.54] allow packages
[2099.54 → 2100.92] to be unpacked
[2100.92 → 2101.48] on an account
[2101.48 → 2102.78] if gifted or traded
[2102.78 → 2104.42] from a lower priced region
[2104.42 → 2106.18] to a higher priced region.
[2106.34 → 2108.06] So if Buddy in the US
[2108.06 → 2109.68] wants to buy a game
[2109.68 → 2111.04] for Buddy in Russia,
[2111.26 → 2112.76] then that will work.
[2112.88 → 2113.06] Yeah.
[2113.20 → 2114.18] Which I guess
[2114.18 → 2114.70] is,
[2114.94 → 2115.36] is a
[2115.36 → 2116.14] is a compromise.
[2116.76 → 2117.28] So,
[2117.68 → 2118.28] there's that.
[2118.28 → 2119.66] But Russia,
[2119.90 → 2120.46] Southeast Asia,
[2120.62 → 2121.14] South America,
[2121.42 → 2121.72] Turkey,
[2122.08 → 2123.10] those countries
[2123.10 → 2123.96] will not be able
[2123.96 → 2124.90] to go the other direction.
[2125.10 → 2125.20] Yeah.
[2125.28 → 2125.76] So you won't be able
[2125.76 → 2126.44] to buy a game
[2126.44 → 2126.98] for Buddy
[2126.98 → 2128.76] in other countries
[2128.76 → 2129.64] if you're from there.
[2130.38 → 2130.82] So,
[2131.08 → 2132.00] there you have it.
[2132.06 → 2132.52] This is,
[2132.86 → 2133.30] this is,
[2133.40 → 2133.66] I mean,
[2133.74 → 2135.16] the impact of this
[2135.16 → 2135.42] is,
[2135.50 → 2136.22] is more than you
[2136.22 → 2137.22] might initially think
[2137.22 → 2137.98] because especially
[2137.98 → 2138.72] with the way
[2138.72 → 2140.80] that entire companies
[2140.80 → 2142.56] have sprung up
[2142.56 → 2144.32] around discount games
[2144.32 → 2145.70] based on buying
[2145.70 → 2146.42] from one region
[2146.42 → 2147.34] and selling to another one.
[2147.64 → 2149.02] Their entire business model
[2149.02 → 2150.56] literally just disappeared.
[2150.92 → 2151.94] Completely killed.
[2152.20 → 2153.66] One fell swoop from Valve
[2153.66 → 2155.50] and Valve is going
[2155.50 → 2156.10] to be able
[2156.10 → 2157.34] to increase their revenues
[2157.34 → 2158.72] as a direct result
[2158.72 → 2160.00] of this right here
[2160.00 → 2160.92] because you won't be able
[2160.92 → 2162.56] to find that AAA game
[2162.56 → 2163.96] on launch day
[2163.96 → 2165.50] for $10 less
[2165.50 → 2166.14] than you would have
[2166.14 → 2167.06] otherwise had to pay.
[2167.28 → 2168.30] You might have to wait a week.
[2169.54 → 2170.62] Which I guess actually
[2170.62 → 2171.08] leads us.
[2171.08 → 2171.74] You might have to wait a week.
[2173.00 → 2174.02] Speaking of which.
[2174.02 → 2174.38] The open price.
[2174.46 → 2174.56] Yeah,
[2174.60 → 2176.18] we have a topic about that.
[2177.00 → 2177.40] Uh,
[2177.90 → 2178.18] do we?
[2178.38 → 2178.60] Yeah.
[2178.92 → 2179.38] GameStop.
[2179.38 → 2180.30] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2180.44 → 2181.40] GameStop president
[2181.40 → 2182.16] Tony Barrel.
[2182.22 → 2182.94] This was posted by
[2182.94 → 2184.94] Mark21200
[2184.94 → 2186.68] says that
[2186.68 → 2187.84] digital games
[2187.84 → 2189.88] are too cheap.
[2190.28 → 2191.06] Oh, no.
[2191.58 → 2191.86] Like,
[2191.94 → 2193.32] I have to get down there.
[2193.66 → 2194.54] If you put in a T,
[2194.66 → 2195.38] you would have had it.
[2195.66 → 2196.06] A T?
[2196.26 → 2196.50] Yeah.
[2197.42 → 2197.86] GameStop.
[2198.52 → 2198.80] Right?
[2198.98 → 2199.32] See, like,
[2199.36 → 2199.66] I don't know
[2199.66 → 2200.18] that's not working.
[2200.18 → 2200.86] Wait, why aren't you able to...
[2200.86 → 2201.66] That's weird.
[2201.70 → 2202.30] I don't know.
[2203.04 → 2204.02] Yeah, no space.
[2204.02 → 2205.84] That's weird.
[2206.00 → 2206.98] You're on the right doc.
[2207.24 → 2207.52] Yeah.
[2207.76 → 2209.56] Like, I don't know why I can't find it.
[2209.66 → 2210.54] Well, um...
[2210.54 → 2211.48] Can you get that link then?
[2211.60 → 2212.20] Yeah, sure.
[2212.28 → 2212.76] I'll just...
[2212.76 → 2214.64] I'll post the link for you guys in the Twitch chat anyway.
[2214.80 → 2215.50] I know about it.
[2215.52 → 2216.18] I've read about this.
[2216.18 → 2217.68] Um, so, one...
[2217.68 → 2217.88] Okay.
[2218.16 → 2219.56] I have to preface this a little bit.
[2219.78 → 2220.72] I know on the show
[2220.72 → 2221.60] a lot of the time
[2221.60 → 2222.32] that I'm up here
[2222.32 → 2223.54] defending physical games.
[2224.26 → 2224.62] Uh,
[2225.02 → 2226.20] I'm not going to defend this dude.
[2226.52 → 2228.02] Yeah, we've had enough arguments
[2228.02 → 2228.70] on this show.
[2229.06 → 2229.70] Yeah, well, no.
[2229.76 → 2230.96] I will wreck you
[2230.96 → 2232.54] when it comes to physical games.
[2232.56 → 2232.80] Well, no.
[2232.98 → 2234.62] I like physical games,
[2234.74 → 2235.88] but I don't think that means
[2235.88 → 2236.12] that they should be...
[2236.12 → 2237.54] I like physical games, too.
[2237.80 → 2238.16] I...
[2238.16 → 2239.20] Ha ha!
[2240.00 → 2241.20] It's probably the best show
[2241.20 → 2242.18] to possibly do that on.
[2242.68 → 2243.08] Um,
[2243.18 → 2245.32] I can't defend the dude
[2245.32 → 2246.10] trying to say that
[2246.10 → 2248.18] digital games are too cheap.
[2248.32 → 2249.44] Like, I don't care.
[2250.10 → 2251.92] Uh, my defence for physical games
[2251.92 → 2253.38] is stuff like when
[2253.38 → 2254.96] there's a 50 gigabyte game
[2254.96 → 2256.54] and someone has a bad internet connection.
[2256.82 → 2257.06] Yeah.
[2257.38 → 2258.76] Then go buy the physical game,
[2258.84 → 2260.32] and I hope that that option
[2260.32 → 2261.16] is always there.
[2261.32 → 2262.60] Even if it just becomes
[2262.60 → 2264.66] GameStop doesn't freaking exist anymore
[2264.66 → 2266.30] and you have to go order your game on Amazon,
[2266.58 → 2267.84] Amazon does a pretty good job
[2267.84 → 2268.84] of making sure that you get your game
[2268.84 → 2269.50] on release day.
[2269.64 → 2269.82] Yeah.
[2269.90 → 2270.88] So that can solve that problem.
[2271.12 → 2272.34] I don't care about being able
[2272.34 → 2273.06] to walk into the store.
[2273.22 → 2274.48] My video game store locally
[2274.48 → 2275.94] will probably always exist
[2275.94 → 2277.14] because they're into
[2277.14 → 2278.58] buying and selling
[2278.58 → 2279.48] old retro games.
[2279.60 → 2280.66] They have multifaceted
[2280.66 → 2281.82] their business very well.
[2281.90 → 2282.82] That's why they still exist.
[2283.02 → 2284.40] So it won't be until
[2284.40 → 2287.32] digital-only games
[2287.32 → 2288.24] are retro
[2288.24 → 2289.56] that they'll really run into trouble.
[2289.56 → 2289.74] Yes.
[2289.74 → 2290.28] By the time...
[2290.28 → 2290.90] By that time,
[2291.00 → 2291.42] the owners,
[2291.56 → 2292.18] because it's just like
[2292.18 → 2293.06] a mom-and-pop shop
[2293.06 → 2294.30] will probably not be interested
[2294.30 → 2294.88] in running
[2294.88 → 2296.94] Willow Video any more anyway.
[2297.04 → 2297.68] So, like, it's not...
[2297.68 → 2298.32] It's not...
[2298.32 → 2299.26] I'm not worried about
[2299.26 → 2299.92] the one store
[2299.92 → 2300.90] that I actually care about.
[2300.90 → 2303.04] Um, and I'm not super worried
[2303.04 → 2304.12] about physical games
[2304.12 → 2305.02] completely disappearing.
[2305.14 → 2306.40] Are you worried about GameStop?
[2306.84 → 2307.08] No.
[2308.76 → 2309.98] I'm not worried about GameStop.
[2310.06 → 2311.70] And, like, this dude's just wrong.
[2311.92 → 2314.14] He does have a valid point.
[2314.30 → 2315.82] And this does tie into
[2315.82 → 2317.46] our segue here
[2317.46 → 2319.12] where the joke was
[2319.12 → 2321.12] an AAA title comes out
[2321.12 → 2322.20] for $59.99
[2322.20 → 2323.90] and the next week
[2323.90 → 2325.34] it's going to be $49.99.
[2325.54 → 2326.58] Civilization Beyond Earth
[2326.58 → 2328.04] got, like, a 50% discount
[2328.04 → 2329.54] on Winter Sale or something.
[2329.54 → 2330.92] It's been out for, what,
[2330.98 → 2331.44] a month?
[2331.60 → 2332.42] Not that long.
[2332.46 → 2333.80] Not even a month, I think.
[2334.28 → 2335.68] So, it's one of the...
[2335.68 → 2336.78] So, he does make
[2336.78 → 2337.90] a couple of good points.
[2338.02 → 2338.54] So, the average...
[2339.42 → 2340.90] The average sale price...
[2340.90 → 2341.88] So, a recent survey showed
[2341.88 → 2342.70] that the average price
[2342.70 → 2343.52] a consumer pays
[2343.52 → 2345.28] for an AAA title download
[2345.28 → 2346.38] is $22.
[2347.66 → 2348.06] And...
[2348.06 → 2348.54] Okay.
[2349.20 → 2350.04] There are no sources
[2350.04 → 2350.46] for any of this.
[2350.48 → 2351.70] No sources for any of that.
[2351.78 → 2352.18] Although,
[2352.98 → 2354.26] I wouldn't think
[2354.26 → 2354.98] that that's completely
[2354.98 → 2355.74] out of the question,
[2355.90 → 2356.68] especially if you were to...
[2356.68 → 2357.42] It came out late October.
[2357.70 → 2358.66] Especially if you were
[2358.66 → 2360.16] to factor in...
[2360.16 → 2361.60] Okay, so just over a month
[2361.60 → 2362.80] for Civilization Beyond Earth.
[2363.04 → 2363.96] Especially if you were
[2363.96 → 2364.66] to factor in
[2364.66 → 2366.02] that many AAA titles
[2366.02 → 2367.82] are going to be older ones
[2367.82 → 2368.62] that are being sold
[2368.62 → 2369.88] bundled with other things
[2369.88 → 2370.98] or at $5
[2370.98 → 2372.50] or whatever the case may be.
[2372.60 → 2374.26] I totally believe
[2374.26 → 2374.92] that number.
[2375.40 → 2376.38] And when asked
[2376.38 → 2377.16] how much they would be
[2377.16 → 2377.96] willing to pay,
[2378.12 → 2378.54] apparently,
[2378.76 → 2379.66] this is no source for this,
[2379.66 → 2380.08] no sources.
[2380.24 → 2380.94] Consumers said
[2380.94 → 2382.32] approximately $35.
[2382.66 → 2382.94] Although,
[2383.74 → 2384.46] I kind of believe
[2384.46 → 2385.22] that number too.
[2385.22 → 2386.44] I'd pay $30, $40
[2386.44 → 2388.18] for an AAA game.
[2388.24 → 2389.56] I think the most expensive
[2389.56 → 2390.28] one I bought
[2390.28 → 2391.22] in the last little while
[2391.22 → 2392.30] was South Park
[2392.30 → 2393.02] Stick of Truth.
[2393.38 → 2394.16] That thing held
[2394.16 → 2395.86] its freaking price forever.
[2396.18 → 2396.96] I was sitting
[2396.96 → 2397.78] and waiting.
[2397.90 → 2398.40] I think it's like
[2398.40 → 2399.52] finally on sale now.
[2399.56 → 2400.46] Is it finally on sale?
[2400.46 → 2401.08] Well, whatever.
[2401.18 → 2401.96] I played it already.
[2401.96 → 2402.56] Yeah, no, I know.
[2402.68 → 2403.54] That one took a while
[2403.54 → 2403.88] for sure.
[2404.00 → 2404.60] Screw you,
[2404.68 → 2405.84] Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
[2405.90 → 2406.36] I'm just kidding.
[2406.42 → 2407.04] I love you guys.
[2407.14 → 2408.52] But the last season
[2408.52 → 2409.06] of South Park
[2409.06 → 2409.42] really sucked.
[2409.42 → 2410.10] I don't...
[2410.10 → 2411.50] No matter how wonderful it is,
[2411.56 → 2412.44] I don't think games
[2412.44 → 2413.26] should be discounted
[2413.26 → 2413.94] so quickly
[2413.94 → 2414.88] because I think
[2414.88 → 2415.74] you're ripping profits
[2415.74 → 2416.16] away from companies.
[2416.32 → 2416.54] Anyway,
[2416.72 → 2417.92] but that's up to them.
[2417.96 → 2419.16] So he has a point.
[2419.20 → 2420.00] But that's up to them.
[2420.00 → 2421.92] But he has a point
[2421.92 → 2424.08] about the fact
[2424.08 → 2425.48] that digital games
[2425.48 → 2426.82] can be discounted
[2426.82 → 2427.42] so readily
[2427.42 → 2428.40] and so easily
[2428.40 → 2429.66] just on a whim.
[2429.78 → 2430.52] Oh, it's not moving
[2430.52 → 2431.00] fast enough.
[2431.08 → 2432.22] Oh, discount the whole thing.
[2432.56 → 2433.96] Ignoring that traditional
[2433.96 → 2434.96] supply chain
[2434.96 → 2436.14] and process
[2436.14 → 2437.18] that existed
[2437.18 → 2438.28] for discounting.
[2439.22 → 2441.96] It potentially does damage
[2441.96 → 2443.40] publishers and developers.
[2443.74 → 2445.10] But he's not talking
[2445.10 → 2445.74] about this
[2445.74 → 2447.14] out of concern for them.
[2447.34 → 2447.42] No.
[2447.56 → 2448.66] It has nothing to do with that.
[2448.72 → 2449.88] It has to do with concern
[2449.88 → 2451.00] for his own business
[2451.00 → 2452.40] because if he cared
[2452.40 → 2453.18] that much
[2453.18 → 2454.92] about the due process
[2454.92 → 2456.96] of dropping the prices
[2456.96 → 2457.58] of games
[2457.58 → 2458.36] or whatever else,
[2458.46 → 2459.10] then why weren't
[2459.10 → 2460.02] we're hearing from him
[2460.02 → 2461.52] back when NCI
[2461.52 → 2462.48] was trying to sell
[2462.48 → 2464.30] hard copies of video games
[2464.30 → 2465.34] five years ago
[2465.34 → 2466.60] and didn't get
[2466.60 → 2467.76] any price protection
[2467.76 → 2468.72] when there were
[2468.72 → 2469.54] price drops
[2469.54 → 2470.74] and all this stuff
[2470.74 → 2471.50] that GameStop
[2471.50 → 2472.56] definitely does
[2472.56 → 2473.88] get to enjoy
[2473.88 → 2475.66] at least for the
[2475.66 → 2476.88] limited amount of time
[2476.88 → 2477.56] that they will still
[2477.56 → 2478.14] be around.
[2479.48 → 2480.62] So I guess that's
[2480.62 → 2481.66] all we really have
[2481.66 → 2482.42] to say about that.
[2482.42 → 2482.96] That's all I have
[2482.96 → 2483.50] to say about that.
[2483.72 → 2484.98] Yeah, I'm getting done.
[2485.14 → 2485.78] Good luck with that,
[2485.86 → 2486.18] GameStop.
[2486.36 → 2487.42] Yeah, exactly.
[2488.70 → 2489.46] All right.
[2489.56 → 2489.96] I don't know why
[2489.96 → 2490.72] I couldn't find that topic
[2490.72 → 2491.18] should be.
[2491.26 → 2492.98] That Cool Blue Kid
[2492.98 → 2494.20] posted on the forum.
[2494.32 → 2494.88] This is from
[2494.88 → 2496.22] kitguru.net,
[2496.32 → 2499.20] also assassinscreed.ubi.com.
[2499.26 → 2499.86] Are you posting this
[2499.86 → 2500.22] in the forum?
[2500.30 → 2500.66] I'll go ahead
[2500.66 → 2501.20] and throw it up
[2501.20 → 2501.50] on the screen.
[2501.52 → 2501.54] I'm going to try
[2501.54 → 2502.56] and find this one again.
[2503.62 → 2504.22] Is your just
[2504.22 → 2505.50] search not working?
[2505.68 → 2506.38] Oh no, you got this.
[2506.42 → 2506.86] You got this.
[2506.86 → 2507.16] All right.
[2507.56 → 2508.54] So Linus' screen,
[2508.70 → 2511.04] patch four on hold.
[2513.10 → 2514.66] My favourite quote from this.
[2514.76 → 2515.74] Can I just quote something
[2515.74 → 2516.14] real quick?
[2516.24 → 2516.56] You may.
[2516.56 → 2517.32] I think it's in the notes.
[2517.54 → 2518.08] You may.
[2518.44 → 2518.84] Ubisoft,
[2519.20 → 2520.58] rigorous quality control
[2520.58 → 2522.16] is of paramount importance
[2522.16 → 2522.62] to us
[2522.62 → 2523.46] and your feedback
[2523.46 → 2524.50] over these past weeks
[2524.50 → 2525.32] has indicated
[2525.32 → 2526.08] that it is important
[2526.08 → 2527.20] to you as well.
[2527.42 → 2527.96] We are choosing
[2527.96 → 2528.66] to hold off
[2528.66 → 2529.58] until we can give you
[2529.58 → 2530.72] the improvements
[2530.72 → 2531.68] we've promised.
[2532.20 → 2532.76] We are committing
[2532.76 → 2533.34] to delivering
[2533.34 → 2534.72] major performance improvements
[2534.72 → 2535.72] which requires
[2535.72 → 2536.76] that we refurbish
[2536.76 → 2537.60] the Paris map
[2537.60 → 2538.42] and it will be
[2538.42 → 2539.34] a few more days
[2539.34 → 2539.94] until we can hit
[2539.94 → 2540.70] that high level
[2540.70 → 2541.20] of quality
[2541.20 → 2542.26] our players deserve.
[2542.26 → 2542.58] Okay,
[2542.72 → 2544.22] can I have some fun
[2544.22 → 2545.16] with this for a little bit?
[2545.22 → 2545.36] Sure.
[2545.36 → 2546.34] Because you got to read it
[2546.34 → 2547.42] and that was pretty fun.
[2547.68 → 2548.08] Yep,
[2548.28 → 2549.04] go for it.
[2549.16 → 2549.44] Okay,
[2549.44 → 2553.38] so first up Ubisoft,
[2553.98 → 2555.76] choosing to hold off
[2555.76 → 2557.12] until we can give you
[2557.12 → 2558.72] what we promised.
[2559.22 → 2560.10] That's the kind of thing
[2560.10 → 2561.96] you do before you take the money.
[2562.88 → 2564.40] Not when people already
[2564.40 → 2565.28] have the product
[2565.28 → 2566.74] and you get to kind of
[2566.74 → 2567.32] sit on ass.
[2567.42 → 2567.52] Like,
[2567.90 → 2570.96] I am usually the first one
[2570.96 → 2573.16] to applaud a game developer
[2573.16 → 2574.08] or publisher
[2574.08 → 2575.36] or anyone involved
[2575.36 → 2576.02] in the process
[2576.02 → 2577.24] of releasing a game
[2577.24 → 2577.78] to the public.
[2577.78 → 2578.48] I'm the first one
[2578.48 → 2579.14] to applaud them
[2579.14 → 2579.96] for holding off
[2579.96 → 2580.64] until it's ready.
[2581.16 → 2582.08] That just does not apply
[2582.08 → 2582.86] to patches.
[2583.62 → 2584.64] Patches are supposed
[2584.64 → 2585.50] to be dealt with
[2585.50 → 2586.60] quick fast
[2586.60 → 2588.22] and putting them on hold
[2588.22 → 2588.98] is terrible.
[2589.38 → 2589.78] Okay,
[2589.88 → 2590.58] and the second one,
[2590.62 → 2591.06] the second one
[2591.06 → 2591.64] that's really fun.
[2592.24 → 2593.04] We are committed
[2593.04 → 2593.70] to blah blah blah
[2593.70 → 2594.74] major performance improvements
[2594.74 → 2595.44] which requires
[2595.44 → 2596.40] that we refurbish
[2596.40 → 2597.34] the Paris map.
[2597.48 → 2597.64] Now,
[2598.14 → 2599.30] what other map is there
[2599.30 → 2600.32] in Assassin's Creed Unity?
[2601.02 → 2601.60] Can I just,
[2601.84 → 2602.92] can I get some clarification
[2602.92 → 2603.54] on this?
[2603.62 → 2604.10] I'm sorry,
[2604.20 → 2605.86] is there a London map?
[2606.44 → 2607.76] Is there a Zimbabwe
[2607.78 → 2608.98] you know,
[2609.14 → 2609.38] map?
[2609.50 → 2610.22] Zimbabwe map?
[2610.34 → 2610.48] Yeah,
[2610.56 → 2611.66] is there like a
[2611.86 → 2613.16] they go on vacation sometimes.
[2613.22 → 2614.22] Is there a Tokyo map?
[2614.58 → 2614.72] Like,
[2614.90 → 2616.00] what other map is there?
[2616.20 → 2617.60] The way that they spun this
[2617.60 → 2618.30] is hilarious.
[2618.52 → 2619.64] We have to refurbish
[2619.64 → 2620.58] our Paris map.
[2620.82 → 2622.24] You mean the entire
[2622.24 → 2623.48] game world?
[2623.76 → 2624.54] Is that what you mean
[2624.54 → 2625.32] to say Ubisoft?
[2625.72 → 2626.66] You have to refurbish
[2626.66 → 2627.76] the entire game world?
[2627.82 → 2628.56] Because I can understand
[2628.56 → 2629.56] why the patch is on hold
[2629.56 → 2630.46] if that's what you need to do
[2630.46 → 2631.34] and I think we all know
[2631.34 → 2632.50] that that's what you need to do
[2632.50 → 2633.48] because the game was limited
[2633.48 → 2634.70] because there's way too many
[2634.70 → 2635.80] draw calls on the PC
[2635.80 → 2637.46] and they couldn't be arsed
[2637.46 → 2638.30] to fix it
[2638.30 → 2639.06] even though
[2639.06 → 2640.34] some idiot
[2640.34 → 2641.18] with a podcast
[2641.18 → 2642.58] already knows
[2642.58 → 2643.60] that that's the problem.
[2643.74 → 2644.00] And yes,
[2644.06 → 2645.06] it's because of light bouncing
[2645.06 → 2645.38] and stuff
[2645.38 → 2646.28] but the draw calls
[2646.28 → 2647.80] is the base essential
[2647.80 → 2648.64] part of the problem.
[2652.24 → 2653.10] 634 comments.
[2653.16 → 2653.92] This might be fun.
[2654.04 → 2654.46] Oh God.
[2654.92 → 2656.26] We need like another
[2656.26 → 2658.20] because like
[2658.20 → 2659.20] I think they're done digging.
[2659.82 → 2661.02] I think we need like a hat
[2661.02 → 2661.94] like a dunce cap
[2661.94 → 2662.08] or something.
[2662.08 → 2662.42] Look at this.
[2662.42 → 2664.60] The first post
[2664.60 → 2665.66] is already excellent.
[2665.88 → 2666.44] Oh man.
[2666.70 → 2667.68] How about more forewarning
[2667.68 → 2668.34] next time?
[2668.60 → 2668.88] I mean,
[2668.98 → 2670.08] you tell us on the day
[2670.08 → 2671.54] it was supposed to be released
[2671.54 → 2672.80] that it won't be coming out.
[2673.22 → 2674.86] Surely you knew beforehand
[2674.86 → 2676.26] that you were running behind.
[2678.80 → 2679.72] Oh no.
[2679.98 → 2680.30] Oh.
[2681.14 → 2682.36] I'm also disappointed
[2682.36 → 2683.32] that the console versions
[2683.32 → 2684.24] have been patched
[2684.24 → 2685.50] and the PC one hasn't.
[2685.80 → 2685.98] Yeah,
[2686.02 → 2687.76] that's from Moor More
[2687.76 → 2689.50] on the Assassin's Creed.
[2689.50 → 2690.60] Mo Zero OK.
[2691.08 → 2692.08] Mo Zero OK.
[2692.94 → 2693.46] Yeah.
[2693.78 → 2695.04] He tried to spell.
[2695.76 → 2696.12] Or she.
[2696.52 → 2697.50] And it didn't work.
[2697.74 → 2697.90] Nope.
[2699.38 → 2700.78] This is just more of a
[2700.78 → 2702.00] like science-y news thing.
[2702.10 → 2702.96] Not really gaming.
[2703.22 → 2703.94] Definitely tech.
[2704.26 → 2706.10] The Mars rover Curiosity
[2706.10 → 2707.96] confirms organics
[2707.96 → 2708.68] on Mars.
[2708.80 → 2708.94] Now,
[2709.30 → 2710.80] they did find traces.
[2710.86 → 2710.96] Oh,
[2711.00 → 2711.70] this was posted by
[2711.70 → 2712.56] Devilish Booster
[2712.56 → 2713.04] on the forum,
[2713.12 → 2713.40] by the way.
[2713.48 → 2714.44] I'll get that link in chat,
[2714.52 → 2714.86] you guys.
[2715.00 → 2715.22] Yeah.
[2715.54 → 2716.02] So,
[2716.02 → 2718.30] they did find traces
[2718.30 → 2719.08] before,
[2719.08 → 2719.78] but,
[2719.78 → 2720.92] it was considered
[2720.92 → 2722.86] to be unconfirmed
[2722.86 → 2724.36] because they weren't sure
[2724.36 → 2726.00] if the rover itself
[2726.00 → 2727.10] had brought
[2727.10 → 2728.74] the things that they found before.
[2728.86 → 2728.98] Well,
[2729.06 → 2729.38] now,
[2729.54 → 2731.56] they are definitely sure.
[2731.76 → 2731.90] So,
[2731.98 → 2732.96] whether they were delivered
[2732.96 → 2734.94] by carbon-rich meteorites
[2734.94 → 2736.86] or actually formed on Mars
[2736.86 → 2737.78] is something that
[2737.78 → 2738.66] could take
[2738.66 → 2740.06] years
[2740.06 → 2740.74] and
[2740.74 → 2742.48] most definitely
[2742.48 → 2743.72] new equipment
[2743.72 → 2744.88] on the surface of Mars
[2744.88 → 2745.52] in order for them
[2745.52 → 2746.40] to actually
[2746.40 → 2747.74] ascertain for certain.
[2748.28 → 2748.76] Can you say
[2748.76 → 2750.04] ascertain for certain?
[2750.10 → 2750.70] Because certain
[2750.70 → 2751.74] is kind of the root
[2751.74 → 2753.16] of the word ascertain.
[2754.16 → 2755.06] I'm not sure.
[2755.06 → 2755.54] I don't really think so,
[2755.70 → 2755.98] but maybe.
[2755.98 → 2756.06] Yeah,
[2756.06 → 2756.72] I don't think so.
[2757.18 → 2758.14] You heard it here first.
[2758.62 → 2759.50] Ascertain for certain.
[2761.44 → 2761.80] And
[2761.80 → 2763.58] Mars is an extremely
[2763.58 → 2764.44] volatile place.
[2764.62 → 2764.68] Like,
[2764.76 → 2765.62] it's going to be hard
[2765.62 → 2766.24] for that kind of stuff
[2766.24 → 2766.80] to survive,
[2767.22 → 2770.38] which makes sense,
[2770.46 → 2771.10] which is why
[2771.10 → 2771.82] a lot of people think
[2771.82 → 2772.38] that it's probably
[2772.38 → 2773.10] from asteroids.
[2773.62 → 2773.96] But,
[2774.04 → 2774.74] there's also
[2774.74 → 2775.88] the interesting things
[2775.88 → 2777.10] of like the methane gas
[2777.10 → 2778.16] very specifically.
[2778.38 → 2778.46] So,
[2778.54 → 2779.30] it could be spurting up
[2779.30 → 2780.12] from below the surface.
[2780.26 → 2781.32] That could be something there.
[2781.46 → 2782.02] Pretty interesting.
[2782.24 → 2782.48] Yeah,
[2782.48 → 2783.68] it's exciting.
[2784.22 → 2784.52] I mean,
[2785.10 → 2785.56] who knows?
[2785.74 → 2786.06] Okay.
[2786.56 → 2787.26] I just kind of wanted
[2787.26 → 2788.08] to have this topic in here
[2788.08 → 2788.92] so people could hear about it
[2788.92 → 2789.56] and research it more
[2789.56 → 2789.96] on their own.
[2790.00 → 2791.36] If Musk gets his way
[2791.36 → 2792.14] and sends like,
[2792.20 → 2792.96] how many people do you want
[2792.96 → 2793.16] to send?
[2793.22 → 2793.66] Like a million?
[2793.76 → 2794.62] You want to send a million
[2794.62 → 2796.02] and I know it's going to be like
[2796.02 → 2797.32] spurt, spurt, spurt, spurt
[2797.32 → 2797.86] and then it's supposed
[2797.86 → 2799.40] to be bigger ones after that.
[2801.60 → 2802.52] Not all at once?
[2802.64 → 2803.90] The end goal is having
[2803.90 → 2805.38] like a million people on Mars.
[2805.60 → 2805.92] Okay.
[2806.12 → 2806.90] Would you go to Mars?
[2807.96 → 2809.54] I haven't talked to you about this.
[2809.70 → 2810.30] Have I talked to you about this?
[2810.32 → 2810.84] I don't think so.
[2810.84 → 2813.28] I have tried contacting him
[2813.28 → 2814.32] to see if I could sign up.
[2814.82 → 2815.20] Okay.
[2815.46 → 2815.82] So.
[2816.28 → 2817.62] Is there any reason
[2817.62 → 2819.20] that Linus Media Group
[2819.20 → 2820.64] couldn't run from Mars?
[2820.84 → 2821.46] What would be the...
[2821.46 → 2822.50] By the time that he put
[2822.50 → 2823.40] a million people there,
[2823.46 → 2823.72] Yeah.
[2824.30 → 2825.72] It would probably be fine.
[2826.18 → 2827.60] Like what kind of...
[2827.60 → 2828.04] Because okay,
[2828.12 → 2829.42] like all we have really
[2829.42 → 2830.86] have to do is we would have to...
[2830.86 → 2831.48] Oh yeah,
[2831.58 → 2832.30] if we're going to make videos
[2832.30 → 2833.26] about the latest CPU,
[2833.38 → 2834.18] that'll be a bit of an issue.
[2835.32 → 2836.20] Not necessarily
[2836.20 → 2837.28] because you know that like
[2837.28 → 2838.36] that robot thing
[2838.36 → 2839.08] that kind of rolls around
[2839.08 → 2839.88] and has the screen on it?
[2840.08 → 2840.40] Mm-hmm.
[2840.46 → 2842.14] Just get way better versions of that.
[2844.52 → 2845.36] VR suits,
[2845.36 → 2848.28] wear like that control VR thing
[2848.28 → 2849.08] that we had
[2849.08 → 2850.50] and then just go in little rooms
[2850.50 → 2852.32] and you can just do things on Earth.
[2853.48 → 2854.58] It'll be latency issues,
[2855.24 → 2855.88] but it could work.
[2856.14 → 2857.72] Posted by Dirty Harry on the forum,
[2857.80 → 2859.68] the original article here
[2859.68 → 2860.92] is from Mashable.com.
[2860.92 → 2862.98] Double amputee controls
[2862.98 → 2865.12] bionic arms with his mines.
[2865.28 → 2866.94] The best segue that ever happened
[2866.94 → 2868.28] in the history of WAN show.
[2868.88 → 2871.36] So this is pretty freaking cool.
[2871.50 → 2872.86] Now to be clear, guys,
[2873.50 → 2875.24] it's not...
[2875.24 → 2877.50] He's not going to be playing racquetball yet.
[2877.64 → 2878.44] Did you post the link already?
[2878.70 → 2878.90] Nope.
[2879.08 → 2879.30] Got it.
[2879.30 → 2881.18] He's not going to be playing racquetball
[2881.18 → 2882.14] anytime soon,
[2882.28 → 2882.98] but...
[2882.98 → 2883.80] And like he kind of...
[2883.80 → 2885.90] He has to move the shoulder,
[2886.12 → 2887.02] then the elbow,
[2887.38 → 2888.32] then the wrist.
[2888.54 → 2890.72] Which I wanted to bring this up.
[2890.84 → 2893.68] In like a design standpoint,
[2893.82 → 2895.10] that's actually a perfect place
[2895.10 → 2895.80] to start from,
[2896.10 → 2897.00] because then you just start
[2897.00 → 2898.44] making things more fluid.
[2899.14 → 2900.76] Having all of those already working
[2900.76 → 2901.68] is extremely important.
[2902.46 → 2904.32] It's required extensive training.
[2904.60 → 2907.76] It is not by any means finished yet,
[2908.20 → 2910.08] but the team is hoping
[2910.08 → 2913.06] that they will be able to send him home
[2913.06 → 2916.12] with a pair of working arms
[2916.12 → 2917.84] by the end of this project,
[2918.00 → 2920.44] which is amazing.
[2921.38 → 2924.58] I mean, this is some Star Wars stuff right here.
[2924.58 → 2926.52] This is like Mark Hamill,
[2926.70 → 2930.80] end of Empire Strikes Back type stuff going on here.
[2933.12 → 2934.24] Pretty freaking cool.
[2934.68 → 2935.88] Absolutely incredible.
[2936.08 → 2937.34] And he's moving it with his mind.
[2937.48 → 2940.06] He had to undergo some painful stuff
[2940.06 → 2941.14] in order to make this happen.
[2941.14 → 2941.64] What do they call it?
[2941.64 → 2942.90] He had to reawaken nerves and stuff.
[2942.90 → 2944.12] He had to re-enervation or something.
[2944.12 → 2944.92] He had to re-enervation.
[2945.02 → 2945.58] Yeah, I think so.
[2945.68 → 2946.60] It sounds awful.
[2946.76 → 2947.20] It does.
[2947.82 → 2949.72] It does not sound good at all.
[2950.06 → 2951.60] And they had to also...
[2951.60 → 2952.38] Where is it?
[2952.64 → 2953.40] No, no, no, no, no.
[2953.82 → 2954.84] Yeah, reawaken,
[2955.22 → 2957.24] but there's a different word for it.
[2957.84 → 2958.76] Re-enervating.
[2959.00 → 2959.16] Yeah.
[2959.16 → 2959.60] There we go.
[2959.60 → 2962.48] Yeah, it's no good.
[2962.54 → 2963.82] And they're using some of the nerve endings
[2963.82 → 2965.12] from his chest as well.
[2965.52 → 2966.46] They've brought some over,
[2966.62 → 2968.30] which that probably wasn't exactly
[2968.30 → 2969.80] a fantastic process either.
[2970.16 → 2970.56] Yeah.
[2970.66 → 2971.88] So, I don't know.
[2971.96 → 2975.28] Yeah, what a horrifying process it is right now.
[2975.48 → 2976.12] Like, can you...
[2976.12 → 2977.92] I mean, think of the implications
[2977.92 → 2979.46] for generations to come, though.
[2979.50 → 2981.14] That's fantastic.
[2981.54 → 2983.36] Yeah, this is probably
[2983.36 → 2984.68] one of the most important things
[2984.68 → 2985.38] going on right now.
[2985.50 → 2986.38] I know there's stuff
[2986.38 → 2987.62] that we're probably going to talk about later
[2987.62 → 2988.76] with, like, the Hyperloop
[2988.76 → 2989.96] and some other really cool things,
[2990.28 → 2991.84] but being able to re-enable people
[2991.84 → 2993.66] that have lost or damaged limbs
[2993.66 → 2996.10] very heavily is really cool.
[2996.18 → 2997.20] And think of the implications
[2997.20 → 2999.86] for just people who haven't lost limbs
[2999.86 → 3001.20] but want, like, better limbs.
[3001.38 → 3001.60] Yep.
[3001.76 → 3002.04] Yeah.
[3002.38 → 3003.60] Because this is going to help stuff
[3003.60 → 3004.38] like exists.
[3005.06 → 3005.54] Oh, yeah.
[3006.38 → 3006.74] Exists.
[3007.10 → 3007.98] Happened in my lifetime.
[3008.00 → 3008.72] Exist dance?
[3009.50 → 3011.12] Well, they're already kind of a thing.
[3011.14 → 3012.28] There is an exist dance.
[3013.38 → 3013.78] Oh.
[3015.94 → 3016.30] Oh.
[3017.10 → 3018.04] Exists are already a thing,
[3018.12 → 3019.20] but they can get a lot better.
[3019.50 → 3020.38] Speaking of things
[3020.38 → 3021.48] that can get a lot better,
[3021.60 → 3023.08] your shaving experience.
[3023.20 → 3023.48] Yes.

[3040.56 → 3041.98] And I'm using a Jedi mind trick
[3041.98 → 3042.70] on you right now.
[3043.10 → 3044.18] Join Dollar Shave Club.
[3044.70 → 3045.70] They don't really talk like that.
[3045.70 → 3046.62] These are the razors
[3046.62 → 3047.30] you're looking for.
[3047.72 → 3049.04] You want Dollar Shave Club
[3049.04 → 3050.56] to send the postman
[3050.56 → 3051.38] or lady
[3051.38 → 3052.54] to your house
[3052.54 → 3053.22] once a month
[3053.22 → 3054.34] to bring you razors
[3054.34 → 3055.62] and shaving butter
[3055.62 → 3058.12] and one-wiped Charlie's.
[3058.16 → 3059.12] They're peppermint-scented
[3059.12 → 3060.18] butt wipes for men.
[3060.18 → 3061.96] I mean, you know...
[3061.96 → 3063.26] That is not the easiest thing to say.
[3063.44 → 3065.08] The thing about the peppermint-scented
[3065.08 → 3066.14] butt wipes for men,
[3066.64 → 3067.76] they're pre-moistened
[3067.76 → 3070.38] and I don't understand
[3070.38 → 3072.44] why we don't already use
[3072.44 → 3073.76] moistened butt wipes.
[3074.26 → 3075.16] Quite frankly,
[3075.42 → 3077.32] you can do a much better job that way.
[3077.52 → 3078.42] Toilet paper's actually, like,
[3078.44 → 3079.70] not a super great...
[3079.70 → 3080.18] That's why, like,
[3080.24 → 3081.44] not the whole world uses it.
[3082.12 → 3082.46] Yeah.
[3083.20 → 3084.26] So, um...
[3084.26 → 3084.98] So there you go.
[3085.10 → 3086.16] Dollar Shave Club's
[3086.16 → 3087.40] flushable butt wipes,
[3087.94 → 3089.56] an advancement in technology
[3089.56 → 3091.26] that we can really...
[3091.26 → 3094.26] get our...
[3094.26 → 3094.86] faces in.
[3094.86 → 3095.18] Butts behind.
[3095.40 → 3096.08] Butts behind.
[3096.18 → 3096.64] Thank you.
[3096.94 → 3097.82] Or faces in.
[3097.96 → 3098.30] Or both.
[3099.00 → 3099.68] All right.
[3099.78 → 3100.34] So moving on
[3100.34 → 3101.88] to our next sponsor.
[3102.52 → 3102.82] Aha!
[3103.12 → 3103.44] Yes!
[3103.58 → 3105.14] Intel Holiday Deal.
[3105.28 → 3106.08] So you're going to want to visit
[3106.08 → 3108.04] the link in the Linus Tech Tips forum,
[3108.16 → 3108.96] which I will go ahead
[3108.96 → 3111.42] and I will post somewhere.
[3111.44 → 3112.22] Trying to find it.
[3112.78 → 3113.76] Copy link URL.
[3115.60 → 3116.36] Maybe if I...
[3116.36 → 3117.28] I got it, I got it, I got it.
[3117.30 → 3117.54] Okay.
[3117.66 → 3119.06] Okay, so you're going to want to visit there,
[3119.14 → 3121.34] but Intel has lots of holiday deals
[3121.34 → 3122.80] going on for the holidays.
[3123.04 → 3124.08] Deals on processors,
[3124.32 → 3125.42] Nuns, and SSDs.
[3125.44 → 3127.24] They have had some crazy crap
[3127.24 → 3128.90] going on SSDs.
[3129.26 → 3130.28] During Black Friday,
[3130.40 → 3132.20] did you see the 730 deals on New egg?
[3132.20 → 3133.16] I almost bought those.
[3133.52 → 3134.52] That was ridiculous.
[3134.82 → 3136.34] If it wasn't for the Canadian version
[3136.34 → 3138.02] of New egg having it not nearly
[3138.02 → 3138.82] as cool of a deal,
[3138.96 → 3139.90] I probably would have done it.
[3139.90 → 3140.88] That was, what was it,
[3140.92 → 3142.92] like 99 for a 240 gig
[3142.92 → 3143.88] or something like 120?
[3143.88 → 3144.88] It was essentially 100 bucks
[3144.88 → 3145.86] for a 240 gig.
[3146.20 → 3146.38] Yeah.
[3146.38 → 3148.04] And then in Canada,
[3148.12 → 3148.98] it was like 160.
[3149.36 → 3150.60] So they've got some,
[3150.60 → 3151.78] they've got some New egg deals
[3151.78 → 3153.38] like the $110 off,
[3153.44 → 3154.78] the 4930K,
[3154.96 → 3155.80] which is actually
[3155.80 → 3157.44] an outstanding processor.
[3157.68 → 3158.88] And given that you don't have
[3158.88 → 3160.68] to invest in DDR4 memory,
[3160.68 → 3163.98] potentially a way better option
[3163.98 → 3164.50] right now
[3164.50 → 3165.88] if you're looking to go 6 core
[3165.88 → 3168.10] versus the 5930K
[3168.10 → 3169.74] or even the 5820K.
[3170.58 → 3171.82] They've got 50 bucks off
[3171.82 → 3172.86] the 4970K
[3172.86 → 3174.00] and over 50% off
[3174.00 → 3174.74] some SSDs,
[3174.80 → 3175.68] including the 240 gig
[3175.68 → 3176.28] 730 series.
[3176.34 → 3176.62] Look at this,
[3176.64 → 3177.30] I'm reading my notes.
[3177.74 → 3178.94] I already knew
[3178.94 → 3179.92] about that deal, dog.
[3180.06 → 3181.42] So these deals are running
[3181.42 → 3183.78] until December the 20th.
[3183.92 → 3184.36] Also,
[3184.58 → 3185.44] I have another link
[3185.44 → 3185.94] for you guys.
[3186.02 → 3186.74] You should check out
[3186.74 → 3187.42] a giveaway
[3187.42 → 3188.14] that we're running
[3188.14 → 3189.58] from Intel right now.
[3190.52 → 3191.66] Copy link URL.
[3192.32 → 3193.32] I hate it when it's not
[3193.32 → 3194.14] just the normal
[3194.14 → 3195.20] contextual menu.
[3195.36 → 3195.96] Thank you for that.
[3196.28 → 3196.62] All right.
[3196.66 → 3198.08] So we're also giving away
[3198.08 → 3200.22] two core i7 5820K
[3200.22 → 3201.44] six core processors.
[3201.60 → 3202.02] So go ahead
[3202.02 → 3203.08] and head over to that thread
[3203.08 → 3204.42] for the full details
[3204.42 → 3205.42] and to get signed up
[3205.42 → 3207.70] for a chance to win.
[3208.02 → 3209.10] So thank you again
[3209.10 → 3210.00] to our sponsors,
[3210.20 → 3211.26] Dollar Shave Club
[3211.26 → 3212.94] and, you know,
[3213.52 → 3214.06] and Intel.
[3214.46 → 3215.86] So Dollar Shave Club,
[3216.38 → 3217.12] what if they had
[3217.12 → 3218.32] Dollar Shave Club
[3218.32 → 3219.80] and they deliver you
[3219.80 → 3221.46] a new slave
[3221.46 → 3222.36] every month?
[3223.58 → 3224.76] Like old school
[3224.76 → 3225.54] slave hard drive?
[3226.50 → 3226.80] Yeah.
[3227.22 → 3227.86] No, no.
[3228.10 → 3229.02] Or what if they had,
[3229.38 → 3230.46] what if you had,
[3230.68 → 3231.76] what if on the first month,
[3231.76 → 3232.28] I don't know if I like
[3232.28 → 3232.76] where this is going.
[3232.76 → 3233.84] What if on the first month
[3233.84 → 3235.16] they send you your slave
[3235.16 → 3236.30] and then every month
[3236.30 → 3237.58] they send you a new club
[3237.58 → 3238.56] to hit them with
[3238.56 → 3240.00] because you wear it out.
[3240.54 → 3241.48] Dollar Shave Club.
[3241.86 → 3243.52] I don't like this conversation.
[3244.24 → 3245.44] I don't think you should be able
[3245.44 → 3247.00] to weigh in on political topics anymore.
[3247.12 → 3247.32] Therefore,
[3247.40 → 3247.94] I think I win
[3247.94 → 3248.78] the Sony conversation.
[3249.58 → 3250.38] I am a nun.
[3250.60 → 3251.98] Oh, back wrecked.
[3252.00 → 3252.76] I can't be wrong.
[3253.98 → 3254.38] Okay,
[3254.52 → 3255.70] this is not going somewhere
[3255.70 → 3256.86] where I want to continue talking.
[3257.22 → 3258.68] Elon Musk likes Hyperloop.
[3258.68 → 3260.12] We're going to go there now.
[3262.12 → 3263.48] Hyperloop train research
[3263.48 → 3264.60] has been progressing.
[3264.78 → 3266.08] It hasn't just been sitting there.
[3266.46 → 3267.42] A company named
[3267.42 → 3269.20] Hyperloop Transport Technologies
[3269.20 → 3270.30] or HTT
[3270.30 → 3271.60] has gone together
[3271.60 → 3273.42] with UCLA students
[3273.42 → 3275.30] and some actually
[3275.30 → 3276.58] pretty intense engineers
[3276.58 → 3277.74] from places like Boeing,
[3278.12 → 3278.58] Airbus,
[3278.92 → 3279.48] and SpaceX
[3279.48 → 3280.34] who are all willing
[3280.34 → 3281.48] to work on Hyperloop
[3281.48 → 3282.88] in their spare time
[3282.88 → 3283.96] in exchange for
[3283.96 → 3285.88] some pretty solid stock options.
[3286.40 → 3286.74] So,
[3286.94 → 3287.98] they've got a lot
[3287.98 → 3289.18] of the proof of concepts down.
[3289.28 → 3290.04] They've got the map
[3290.04 → 3290.88] of where they would want it
[3290.88 → 3291.54] to go down.
[3292.82 → 3294.14] They're getting close
[3294.14 → 3294.84] to the idea
[3294.84 → 3295.74] of making a prototype.
[3296.02 → 3296.52] They're not like,
[3296.62 → 3297.44] we are making a prototype,
[3297.66 → 3298.80] but they're getting close to that.
[3298.80 → 3300.08] one of the things
[3300.08 → 3300.60] that they're still
[3300.60 → 3301.76] kind of fighting with
[3301.76 → 3302.48] is how they're going to do
[3302.48 → 3303.40] the actual train.
[3303.52 → 3304.36] The tube itself
[3304.36 → 3305.70] is not that much
[3305.70 → 3306.58] of a question anymore.
[3307.10 → 3308.40] And it's kind of
[3308.40 → 3308.98] in between
[3308.98 → 3310.92] like air compressors
[3310.92 → 3312.32] and an air hockey style
[3312.32 → 3313.74] pushing of the trains,
[3313.86 → 3314.52] which is what
[3314.52 → 3316.34] Musk has suggested,
[3316.76 → 3319.18] or magnetic levitation,
[3319.36 → 3319.90] which is what a lot
[3319.90 → 3320.38] of the engineers
[3320.38 → 3321.46] on the project right now
[3321.46 → 3322.08] are suggesting.
[3322.32 → 3322.50] So,
[3323.02 → 3323.72] really cool.
[3323.90 → 3324.18] Apparently,
[3324.48 → 3324.66] sorry.
[3325.06 → 3325.88] I was just going to say
[3325.88 → 3326.72] the speed that they're
[3326.72 → 3327.74] expected to travel at
[3327.74 → 3328.80] is about Mach 1.
[3329.16 → 3329.42] So,
[3329.52 → 3330.32] that's about the speed
[3330.32 → 3330.82] of sound,
[3331.08 → 3332.82] which is pretty fantastic
[3332.82 → 3334.02] if you want to get from,
[3334.10 → 3334.28] you know,
[3334.32 → 3334.74] I don't know,
[3334.96 → 3336.52] Boston to somewhere
[3336.52 → 3338.10] geographically relevant
[3338.10 → 3338.80] to Boston
[3338.80 → 3340.24] because I'm not that good
[3340.24 → 3341.34] with my U.S. geography.
[3341.74 → 3342.06] Yeah!
[3344.10 → 3344.88] Investors will need
[3344.88 → 3346.08] to find and raise
[3346.08 → 3348.28] six to ten billion dollars
[3348.28 → 3349.58] to build the first
[3349.58 → 3350.76] 400 mile loop,
[3350.86 → 3351.48] and they would obviously
[3351.48 → 3352.10] have to prototype
[3352.10 → 3352.82] before that.
[3353.56 → 3354.44] Extremely expensive,
[3354.92 → 3355.66] but this could be
[3355.66 → 3356.58] what we're looking into
[3356.58 → 3358.46] in terms of future
[3358.46 → 3359.22] mass transportation.
[3359.68 → 3359.86] Hey,
[3359.96 → 3361.10] Robbie G's with me.
[3361.20 → 3362.22] A slave is for life,
[3362.30 → 3363.22] not just for Christmas.
[3363.66 → 3365.76] Can we not do this
[3365.76 → 3366.36] at all,
[3366.58 → 3366.90] please?
[3367.20 → 3368.62] Let's just move on.
[3369.66 → 3370.14] Oh,
[3370.22 → 3370.88] our next topic
[3370.88 → 3372.06] was going to be Ubisoft
[3372.06 → 3373.00] and then the Mars Rover.
[3373.14 → 3373.90] Now it's Eric Schmidt
[3373.90 → 3374.62] being weird.
[3374.74 → 3375.02] Oh,
[3375.16 → 3376.02] what is he thinking?
[3376.16 → 3376.28] So,
[3376.36 → 3376.82] this was posted
[3376.82 → 3377.66] by Spider Loser
[3377.66 → 3378.12] on the forum.
[3378.22 → 3378.74] This is actually
[3378.74 → 3380.30] a topic from last week.
[3380.72 → 3381.44] Let's go ahead
[3381.44 → 3382.34] and fire this up.
[3382.66 → 3384.06] But Eric Schmidt,
[3384.06 → 3386.48] so one of the founders
[3386.48 → 3387.60] of Google,
[3388.84 → 3390.14] so chairman
[3390.14 → 3391.08] and former CEO
[3391.08 → 3391.64] of Google,
[3391.96 → 3392.88] basically came out
[3392.88 → 3393.70] and said he believes
[3393.70 → 3394.46] that concerns
[3394.46 → 3396.80] of machines stealing jobs
[3396.80 → 3398.28] and taking over the world
[3398.28 → 3399.32] is unwarranted.
[3399.32 → 3399.80] Now,
[3399.86 → 3401.20] I think taking over the world
[3401.20 → 3402.50] is a bit of a stretch,
[3402.96 → 3403.84] but to imagine
[3403.84 → 3404.56] that machines
[3404.56 → 3406.10] aren't going to steal jobs
[3406.10 → 3407.20] is asinine.
[3407.40 → 3407.48] Like,
[3407.54 → 3408.92] he's a super smart guy,
[3409.06 → 3410.18] so he must know
[3410.18 → 3410.94] something that he's
[3410.94 → 3411.80] not telling us
[3411.80 → 3412.34] because,
[3412.96 → 3413.44] um,
[3413.90 → 3414.22] okay,
[3414.32 → 3414.90] so there were
[3414.90 → 3415.62] a couple other things
[3415.62 → 3415.94] he said.
[3416.02 → 3416.70] So number one
[3416.70 → 3417.78] is that
[3417.78 → 3418.30] they,
[3418.58 → 3419.02] the scientists,
[3419.14 → 3420.08] so scientists developed,
[3420.22 → 3420.94] this was an experiment
[3420.94 → 3421.76] from a few years ago
[3421.76 → 3422.62] where scientists developed
[3422.62 → 3423.52] a neural network
[3423.52 → 3425.18] and fed it 11,000 hours
[3425.18 → 3425.98] of YouTube videos
[3425.98 → 3427.06] to see what it could learn.
[3427.42 → 3428.44] It discovered
[3428.44 → 3429.82] the concept of cat,
[3430.00 → 3430.40] apparently,
[3430.86 → 3431.46] and he goes,
[3431.62 → 3432.42] I'm not quite sure
[3432.42 → 3433.44] what to say about that
[3433.44 → 3434.92] except that's where we are.
[3435.28 → 3436.26] Except that's
[3436.26 → 3437.26] not where we are.
[3437.38 → 3438.44] That was a few years ago
[3438.44 → 3439.56] and it was a random experiment
[3439.56 → 3440.60] and the fact that
[3440.60 → 3441.32] it just figured out
[3441.32 → 3442.34] the concept of cat.
[3442.42 → 3443.80] It's freaking amazing.
[3444.04 → 3445.48] Do you not get that?
[3445.60 → 3446.70] That's crazy.
[3447.74 → 3448.72] And 11,000 hours
[3448.72 → 3449.20] of YouTube videos,
[3449.38 → 3450.20] the computer didn't have to,
[3450.20 → 3450.34] like,
[3450.42 → 3451.36] sit in front of a screen
[3451.36 → 3451.82] and go like,
[3451.88 → 3452.24] oh,
[3452.52 → 3453.30] these are interesting
[3453.30 → 3453.98] YouTube videos.
[3454.06 → 3454.72] It's a computer.
[3455.08 → 3455.68] It probably did it,
[3455.78 → 3455.84] like,
[3456.02 → 3457.18] crazy fast.
[3457.40 → 3457.74] And it learned
[3457.74 → 3458.74] what a cat is.
[3459.02 → 3459.88] That's nuts.
[3460.94 → 3462.02] This is super cool.
[3462.28 → 3462.78] He tries to,
[3462.86 → 3463.06] sorry,
[3463.22 → 3464.54] I'm very heated
[3464.54 → 3465.30] about this topic.
[3465.30 → 3466.18] And there's another
[3466.18 → 3467.54] complete BS thing.
[3467.54 → 3467.76] People have been concerned
[3467.76 → 3468.40] about machines
[3468.40 → 3469.30] taking over the world
[3469.30 → 3469.98] for centuries.
[3470.42 → 3470.90] Go back
[3470.90 → 3472.76] to the history
[3472.76 → 3473.92] of the loom.
[3474.42 → 3475.20] There was absolute
[3475.20 → 3476.30] dislocation,
[3476.46 → 3477.26] but I think all of us
[3477.26 → 3477.98] are better off
[3477.98 → 3479.40] with more mechanized ways
[3479.40 → 3480.66] of getting clothes made.
[3480.80 → 3480.90] Yes.
[3480.90 → 3482.50] Not even remotely comparable.
[3483.52 → 3483.96] God.
[3484.82 → 3485.26] Sorry.
[3485.46 → 3486.08] You can keep going
[3486.08 → 3486.54] if you want.
[3486.90 → 3487.06] No,
[3487.12 → 3488.28] that was pretty much it.
[3488.28 → 3489.06] Very not stoked.
[3489.22 → 3490.28] I think it's ridiculous.
[3490.56 → 3490.80] I mean,
[3491.00 → 3491.20] to,
[3491.32 → 3491.72] to,
[3491.86 → 3493.80] to imagine
[3493.80 → 3494.60] for a second.
[3494.60 → 3494.84] Okay.
[3495.10 → 3495.36] Okay.
[3495.46 → 3495.66] Okay.
[3495.66 → 3495.92] Okay.
[3495.98 → 3496.92] So you could make
[3496.92 → 3497.60] the argument
[3497.60 → 3499.74] that more people,
[3499.92 → 3499.96] like,
[3500.04 → 3500.28] okay,
[3500.36 → 3500.76] more,
[3500.92 → 3501.82] just more wealth
[3501.82 → 3502.78] in general
[3502.78 → 3503.10] and,
[3503.16 → 3503.84] and less,
[3504.28 → 3505.32] less need
[3505.32 → 3506.56] to pursue
[3506.56 → 3507.76] the essentials,
[3507.76 → 3508.14] you know,
[3508.14 → 3508.76] your food
[3508.76 → 3509.98] and your shelter
[3509.98 → 3511.16] and your clean water
[3511.16 → 3512.14] and all that kind of stuff.
[3512.14 → 3512.42] So,
[3512.72 → 3513.92] so making that stuff
[3513.92 → 3515.48] much easier to access
[3515.48 → 3516.90] opens up the doors
[3516.90 → 3517.56] for,
[3517.98 → 3518.50] let's say,
[3518.66 → 3519.58] careers like
[3519.58 → 3521.44] making YouTube videos
[3521.44 → 3521.86] about,
[3522.06 → 3522.56] you know,
[3522.84 → 3523.40] tech crap
[3523.40 → 3524.46] that quite frankly,
[3524.74 → 3526.04] a lot of what we talk about
[3526.04 → 3528.26] nobody really needs.
[3528.30 → 3528.92] It's just stuff
[3528.92 → 3529.58] that we want
[3529.58 → 3530.24] and enjoy
[3530.24 → 3530.74] and,
[3530.86 → 3532.14] right.
[3532.30 → 3532.66] Okay.
[3533.30 → 3533.74] You're talking about
[3533.74 → 3534.50] things people don't need
[3534.50 → 3535.30] where dressed up as girls
[3535.30 → 3536.38] is not exactly required
[3536.38 → 3537.28] to advance the.
[3537.28 → 3537.70] Yeah.
[3537.86 → 3538.10] Like,
[3538.24 → 3538.44] okay,
[3538.54 → 3539.14] so the loom
[3539.14 → 3540.68] enabled things like clothes
[3540.68 → 3541.28] to be,
[3541.28 → 3541.96] or not,
[3542.00 → 3543.00] not necessarily the loom
[3543.00 → 3543.48] but more,
[3543.60 → 3544.68] even more mechanized
[3544.68 → 3546.28] clothing manufacturing
[3546.28 → 3546.90] and,
[3546.94 → 3548.06] and fabric manufacturing
[3548.06 → 3548.90] enabled us to
[3548.90 → 3550.76] cheaply buy
[3550.76 → 3551.38] costumes
[3551.38 → 3552.12] that are
[3552.12 → 3553.38] just literally
[3553.38 → 3554.78] for one time use.
[3554.86 → 3555.00] Yeah.
[3555.20 → 3555.58] And,
[3555.64 → 3556.28] and have it be
[3556.28 → 3557.10] inexpensive enough
[3557.10 → 3557.76] that we can afford
[3557.76 → 3558.42] to do that.
[3558.50 → 3559.82] But the problem
[3559.82 → 3562.28] is not a technology problem.
[3562.28 → 3563.28] It is a societal
[3563.28 → 3564.82] and a political problem.
[3564.84 → 3565.12] Yes.
[3565.12 → 3566.24] That is going to
[3566.24 → 3567.50] take these people
[3567.50 → 3568.70] and put them out of jobs.
[3568.96 → 3569.08] Yep.
[3569.08 → 3570.18] Because if we just
[3570.18 → 3570.60] kind of went,
[3570.78 → 3570.98] yes,
[3570.98 → 3572.70] we have ample resources
[3572.70 → 3574.46] and everything is fine.
[3574.86 → 3575.80] Everyone should just
[3575.80 → 3576.64] have food
[3576.64 → 3577.90] and whether it's a stamp
[3577.90 → 3578.42] program
[3578.42 → 3579.62] or whether it's
[3579.62 → 3580.84] cash money program
[3580.84 → 3581.96] or however it works,
[3582.26 → 3583.26] if there was a system
[3583.26 → 3583.86] in place,
[3583.98 → 3585.20] this wouldn't be a problem.
[3585.30 → 3585.98] The problem is that
[3585.98 → 3586.90] there is no system
[3586.90 → 3587.40] in place
[3587.40 → 3588.82] and people will
[3588.82 → 3590.82] lose their jobs.
[3590.98 → 3591.54] And all we've seen
[3591.54 → 3592.24] is the
[3592.24 → 3592.62] the
[3592.62 → 3593.34] the wealth gap
[3593.34 → 3594.58] increasing over the past
[3594.58 → 3595.60] years to degrees
[3595.60 → 3596.86] which are absolutely ridiculous.
[3596.86 → 3598.74] stuff like the loom
[3598.74 → 3599.86] was able to augment
[3599.86 → 3600.52] workers
[3600.52 → 3601.32] and help them
[3601.32 → 3602.68] be much more efficient
[3602.68 → 3604.16] which did reduce jobs
[3604.16 → 3605.60] necessarily in that field
[3605.60 → 3607.40] but also at a time
[3607.40 → 3608.20] when we needed
[3608.20 → 3608.88] labour workers
[3608.88 → 3609.96] in other areas.
[3610.38 → 3611.68] What AI is going to do
[3611.68 → 3612.58] is completely remove
[3612.58 → 3613.82] the need
[3613.82 → 3615.90] in a vast amount
[3615.90 → 3616.40] of industries
[3616.40 → 3617.48] to the point of
[3617.48 → 3618.78] basically everything
[3618.78 → 3620.36] at a certain degree.
[3620.72 → 3621.00] They've,
[3621.00 → 3621.70] they've already proved
[3621.70 → 3622.34] that they can replace
[3622.34 → 3623.48] some pretty crazy stuff
[3623.48 → 3624.52] which you wouldn't expect.
[3624.52 → 3626.34] even just the transportation
[3626.34 → 3627.98] industry as a whole.
[3628.36 → 3629.58] The entire thing
[3629.58 → 3631.38] is extremely close
[3631.38 → 3631.80] to being able
[3631.80 → 3633.02] to be replaced already
[3633.02 → 3635.34] and that's a huge proportion
[3635.34 → 3636.64] of even just US jobs.
[3636.66 → 3636.68] I mean,
[3636.68 → 3637.74] imagine if next
[3637.74 → 3638.48] they went after
[3638.48 → 3639.34] the people who look
[3639.34 → 3639.84] at animals
[3639.84 → 3640.50] and sort them
[3640.50 → 3641.06] into which ones
[3641.06 → 3641.52] are cats.
[3646.72 → 3647.50] They taught it
[3647.50 → 3648.40] what a cat was.
[3648.54 → 3649.98] That's actually awesome.
[3650.88 → 3651.32] So,
[3651.48 → 3651.80] um,
[3651.90 → 3652.76] I wasn't being serious
[3652.76 → 3653.16] about that.
[3653.16 → 3654.58] I'm not personally
[3654.58 → 3655.50] like against
[3655.50 → 3656.78] the idea of AI.
[3657.04 → 3657.44] I just think
[3657.44 → 3658.56] we really need
[3658.56 → 3659.40] to be ready
[3659.40 → 3660.32] for what it could
[3660.32 → 3661.40] potentially do
[3661.40 → 3663.18] to humanity
[3663.18 → 3664.04] as a whole
[3664.04 → 3665.24] and I do not
[3665.24 → 3665.70] think we are.
[3665.82 → 3666.44] There are countries
[3666.44 → 3667.36] that are working on it.
[3667.74 → 3668.60] Last that I've heard,
[3668.76 → 3669.56] Sweden has started
[3669.56 → 3670.20] working on
[3670.20 → 3671.14] different ways
[3671.14 → 3672.02] that they can augment
[3672.02 → 3673.56] lower work hours
[3673.56 → 3674.66] but similar quality
[3674.66 → 3675.02] of life
[3675.02 → 3675.74] or the same quality
[3675.74 → 3676.44] of life for people.
[3676.64 → 3677.60] Yeah, what was it?
[3677.60 → 3678.34] Places are working on this.
[3678.40 → 3681.16] I think it was
[3681.16 → 3682.10] car manufacturing
[3682.10 → 3683.20] and I think what happened
[3683.20 → 3684.02] is they knocked off
[3684.02 → 3685.10] one whole day a week
[3685.10 → 3686.08] and then they made it
[3686.08 → 3686.98] so that it was a less,
[3687.06 → 3687.82] I think it was six hours
[3687.82 → 3688.42] instead of eight hour
[3688.42 → 3688.94] work days
[3688.94 → 3690.58] but then kept their wages
[3690.58 → 3691.00] the same
[3691.00 → 3691.84] and they've actually found
[3691.84 → 3692.82] that they worked a lot harder
[3692.82 → 3693.98] when they were at work.
[3694.56 → 3694.68] Yeah.
[3694.78 → 3694.92] So,
[3695.08 → 3696.00] it didn't even change
[3696.00 → 3697.56] how necessarily productive
[3697.56 → 3698.00] they were
[3698.00 → 3699.24] and a lot of car manufacturing
[3699.24 → 3699.98] is very automated
[3699.98 → 3700.50] these days.
[3700.60 → 3701.74] Look at the Tesla factory.
[3702.04 → 3703.06] The only people working there
[3703.06 → 3705.32] mainly are checking things,
[3705.40 → 3706.04] making sure machines
[3706.04 → 3706.72] are running fine,
[3706.82 → 3707.56] making sure the process
[3707.56 → 3708.26] was done okay.
[3708.72 → 3709.84] It's basically all automated.
[3710.24 → 3711.20] People need to wake up,
[3711.20 → 3713.94] realize that a shoot ton of jobs
[3713.94 → 3715.16] are going to be completely replaced
[3715.16 → 3718.76] and not augmented and improved
[3718.76 → 3719.86] and people can go work elsewhere.
[3720.22 → 3722.24] Where those people would go work elsewhere
[3722.24 → 3723.76] are also going to be replaced.
[3723.92 → 3724.16] I mean,
[3724.26 → 3725.88] imagine this for a second.
[3726.24 → 3726.26] Like,
[3726.62 → 3728.32] just for a lark,
[3728.84 → 3730.08] would you go to
[3730.08 → 3731.74] a fully automated restaurant
[3731.74 → 3734.86] where you sit down at your table
[3734.86 → 3736.74] and the table
[3736.74 → 3738.92] is like a touchscreen tablet
[3738.92 → 3740.38] where you use,
[3740.48 → 3741.50] basically you go like,
[3741.78 → 3742.04] menu.
[3742.18 → 3742.98] You drag your menus
[3742.98 → 3743.86] over to where you are
[3743.86 → 3744.80] and you kind of go like,
[3744.88 → 3745.32] blip pity bloop,
[3745.36 → 3746.12] I want this one.
[3746.36 → 3747.52] Here are some special instructions
[3747.52 → 3748.22] for the kitchen
[3748.22 → 3751.22] and you never actually see,
[3751.32 → 3752.44] you never see anyone
[3752.44 → 3753.36] come to your table
[3753.36 → 3754.72] and then the layout
[3754.72 → 3755.36] of the restaurant,
[3755.52 → 3755.62] like,
[3755.66 → 3756.40] they have,
[3756.40 → 3758.74] like a very rudimentary version of this
[3758.74 → 3760.48] that I've seen at some sushi places
[3760.48 → 3761.94] where everything will just be
[3761.94 → 3762.70] on a little track.
[3762.72 → 3762.74] Yeah,
[3762.74 → 3763.76] it like floats by you.
[3763.78 → 3764.60] And it floats by you
[3764.60 → 3765.06] and you take it
[3765.06 → 3767.36] except instead of it being like that
[3767.36 → 3768.14] where it's just,
[3768.24 → 3769.08] it's not smart,
[3769.32 → 3770.90] you have a smart system for that.
[3770.98 → 3771.90] So the kitchen basically
[3771.90 → 3772.84] puts it on the thing
[3772.84 → 3774.12] and then it comes
[3774.12 → 3775.14] and gets off
[3775.14 → 3776.14] right next to your table.
[3776.30 → 3776.88] You bring it,
[3777.08 → 3777.90] you eat it.
[3778.06 → 3779.54] Anytime you need an extra drink,
[3779.80 → 3780.66] you just have like,
[3780.72 → 3780.88] okay,
[3780.96 → 3782.40] you have like a spot on the table
[3782.40 → 3784.48] with a little optical sensor.
[3784.90 → 3786.02] Anytime the drink is empty,
[3786.02 → 3787.46] new drink shows up
[3787.46 → 3788.66] and you put the old one
[3788.66 → 3789.06] on the cart,
[3789.16 → 3789.92] it goes back to the kitchen.
[3790.04 → 3790.20] I mean,
[3790.30 → 3791.36] I'd be completely okay with it.
[3791.70 → 3792.82] What I'm going to want to focus on.
[3792.82 → 3793.78] We have the technology for that today.
[3793.82 → 3793.98] Yeah,
[3794.04 → 3794.50] exactly.
[3794.62 → 3795.46] And people have,
[3795.46 → 3796.62] that would be the huge industry.
[3796.74 → 3798.34] People have demonstrated
[3798.34 → 3800.64] that they hate tipping.
[3801.18 → 3801.48] Yep.
[3801.74 → 3804.80] So taking away those jobs,
[3804.92 → 3806.34] the ones that rely on tips,
[3806.50 → 3808.86] people are going to embrace that stuff
[3808.86 → 3810.18] and that is a lot of jobs.
[3810.28 → 3810.40] I mean,
[3810.48 → 3812.46] food services here in Vancouver anyway
[3812.46 → 3813.44] is enormous.
[3814.10 → 3814.36] Massive.
[3814.90 → 3815.64] And that's a huge,
[3815.64 → 3816.92] take out transportation
[3816.92 → 3817.88] and food services
[3817.88 → 3819.66] that's potential to be done
[3819.66 → 3820.72] in the next year or two.
[3820.92 → 3823.98] That's two massive industries.
[3824.88 → 3825.96] Like huge.
[3826.22 → 3826.82] And that's totally true.
[3826.88 → 3827.78] And people have brought up like,
[3827.78 → 3829.40] a year or two to have the technology,
[3829.54 → 3830.58] not a year or two before
[3830.58 → 3832.40] businesses have invested enough
[3832.40 → 3832.68] to replace their staff.
[3832.68 → 3833.48] It'll take quite a while
[3833.48 → 3834.92] for people to actually invest
[3834.92 → 3835.34] in everything.
[3835.34 → 3837.08] But like,
[3837.28 → 3838.60] what was I trying to say?
[3839.98 → 3840.34] Crap,
[3840.40 → 3841.14] I don't remember where I was going.
[3841.16 → 3842.90] I would call my chain Robot's Diner.
[3843.30 → 3843.78] Robot's Diner.
[3843.84 → 3844.06] Right,
[3844.16 → 3844.40] okay.
[3844.68 → 3845.68] Talking about Robot's.
[3846.92 → 3848.06] People talked about
[3848.06 → 3848.96] when it was starting to happen
[3848.96 → 3850.02] where they were bringing
[3850.02 → 3851.34] automated telling machines
[3851.34 → 3852.62] into grocery stores,
[3852.62 → 3854.84] which are super not advanced.
[3854.96 → 3855.84] Apparently there's a restaurant
[3855.84 → 3856.48] in the Netherlands
[3856.48 → 3857.58] that uses holograms
[3857.58 → 3858.08] and touchscreens
[3858.08 → 3859.66] for ordering food from your table.
[3859.80 → 3860.24] There you go.
[3860.40 → 3860.78] So there you go.
[3861.04 → 3862.06] It's already happening.
[3862.30 → 3864.14] So automated tellers
[3864.14 → 3865.76] in places like fast food restaurants
[3865.76 → 3866.48] and grocery stores,
[3866.56 → 3868.18] a lot of people were super against.
[3868.48 → 3870.04] There was a very large uproar.
[3870.18 → 3870.36] And then,
[3870.42 → 3871.30] do you even hear that anymore?
[3871.86 → 3873.10] When I go to the grocery store,
[3873.50 → 3874.76] I usually actually prefer
[3874.76 → 3876.16] to go through the automated teller
[3876.16 → 3876.96] because I'm like,
[3877.04 → 3878.36] I will go much faster.
[3878.80 → 3878.94] Yeah.
[3878.98 → 3879.94] Like if I go to Home Depot,
[3880.08 → 3880.46] for example,
[3880.46 → 3881.30] and I have to buy something,
[3881.36 → 3882.28] I had to go buy screws
[3882.28 → 3882.84] the other day.
[3882.96 → 3883.62] And I'm like,
[3883.70 → 3884.68] I walk up to the thing,
[3884.74 → 3885.76] there's a line of tellers
[3885.76 → 3886.88] and there's the automated machine.
[3886.98 → 3887.30] So I'm like,
[3887.38 → 3887.62] hmm,
[3887.96 → 3888.20] well,
[3888.58 → 3889.36] walk up to the automated machine,
[3889.36 → 3889.94] scan,
[3890.10 → 3890.36] scan,
[3890.50 → 3890.74] pay,
[3890.86 → 3891.16] gone.
[3891.40 → 3892.56] It was superfast.
[3892.64 → 3893.72] I didn't have to deal with anyone
[3893.72 → 3894.60] who I could tell hated
[3894.60 → 3895.74] everything that they were doing.
[3895.88 → 3897.32] Once Apple Pay comes to Canada,
[3897.42 → 3898.56] it'll be even faster.
[3898.90 → 3899.32] Scan,
[3899.48 → 3899.84] scan,
[3900.56 → 3901.74] touch the thing
[3901.74 → 3902.58] and then leave.
[3902.64 → 3903.80] Like even faster.
[3905.68 → 3906.12] Yeah.
[3906.66 → 3908.04] A lot of jobs are going to go away.
[3908.04 → 3910.24] It's not like one industry
[3910.24 → 3912.00] and one part of one industry.
[3912.26 → 3913.34] It's everything
[3913.34 → 3915.32] that will be affected.
[3916.30 → 3918.20] We should be okay for a while yet.
[3918.20 → 3920.64] Japan's already working on
[3920.64 → 3921.54] replacing newscasters.
[3921.54 → 3921.74] Yeah,
[3921.78 → 3922.20] I saw that.
[3922.20 → 3923.42] It's really similar to our jobs.
[3924.08 → 3924.68] Sort of.
[3924.82 → 3925.88] We do other things too.
[3926.14 → 3926.44] I know.
[3927.12 → 3927.30] Like,
[3927.54 → 3927.96] okay,
[3928.22 → 3929.98] newscasters will be a lot easier
[3929.98 → 3931.32] to replace than entertainers.
[3931.32 → 3932.06] I'm just saying,
[3932.18 → 3933.36] it's in the same field.
[3933.44 → 3934.50] Somewhere in between.
[3934.62 → 3935.58] It's in the same field.
[3935.70 → 3936.58] And like one thing that
[3936.58 → 3937.84] Hollywood's already started working on,
[3937.88 → 3938.86] like if you remember Iron,
[3939.26 → 3940.56] they like scanned the dude's face
[3940.56 → 3941.58] and then barely used them.
[3941.90 → 3942.12] Yep.
[3942.12 → 3944.66] And did you see how amazing
[3944.66 → 3946.88] in Cod Advanced Warfare,
[3947.32 → 3947.70] crap,
[3947.82 → 3948.82] I forget his name,
[3949.18 → 3950.02] The guy that plays the dude.
[3950.02 → 3950.74] Keyser Söze.
[3952.00 → 3952.68] Keyser Söze.
[3952.90 → 3953.14] Yeah.
[3953.48 → 3954.12] Kevin Spacey.
[3954.24 → 3954.32] Thank you.
[3954.32 → 3954.80] There you go.
[3955.04 → 3955.20] Yeah,
[3955.30 → 3956.16] Kevin Spacey.
[3956.36 → 3956.52] Yeah,
[3956.52 → 3957.36] he plays Keyser Söze.
[3957.56 → 3957.76] Yeah,
[3957.78 → 3957.94] no,
[3957.94 → 3959.42] I was thinking of the actor's name.
[3959.50 → 3959.66] Yeah,
[3959.74 → 3959.86] yeah,
[3959.92 → 3960.04] I just,
[3960.04 → 3961.24] I couldn't remember.
[3961.62 → 3962.30] But yeah,
[3962.66 → 3963.78] Kevin Spacey
[3963.78 → 3965.56] looked freaking awesome
[3965.56 → 3966.26] in that game.
[3966.62 → 3967.32] Ridiculously good.
[3967.32 → 3969.76] Like that section can be replaced.
[3970.24 → 3971.16] It can happen.
[3973.14 → 3973.40] Yeah,
[3973.64 → 3974.40] some people are like,
[3974.60 → 3975.96] I've been told by Terran,
[3976.06 → 3976.30] they're like,
[3976.36 → 3976.68] oh yeah,
[3976.80 → 3976.96] well,
[3977.16 → 3978.62] you'll never be able to automate editing.
[3978.86 → 3979.36] Like dude,
[3981.20 → 3981.86] that'll happen.
[3982.14 → 3983.24] It will take a lot longer.
[3983.26 → 3984.22] It will take a lot longer.
[3984.40 → 3984.68] Like,
[3984.86 → 3987.18] you'll be able to automate the editing
[3987.18 → 3990.42] of something like a newscast
[3990.42 → 3991.36] much more easily
[3991.36 → 3992.78] than you'll be able to automate the editing
[3992.78 → 3994.48] of something artistic or funny.
[3995.58 → 3995.60] but,
[3995.64 → 3997.06] but they've already proven
[3997.06 → 3997.78] that they can,
[3997.92 → 3998.30] uh,
[3998.30 → 3999.88] have robots that can make music
[3999.88 → 4000.72] and they can,
[4000.84 → 4002.26] already proven that they can make robots
[4002.26 → 4002.92] that can create humour.
[4003.90 → 4004.30] So,
[4004.98 → 4007.18] it probably won't take as long as expected.
[4008.44 → 4008.84] Um,
[4009.74 → 4011.18] something seems to be confusing
[4011.18 → 4012.10] about the chat.
[4013.10 → 4013.94] The one's saying F.
[4014.28 → 4014.62] Okay.
[4014.98 → 4015.20] Oh,
[4015.20 → 4015.40] right,
[4015.48 → 4016.62] press F to pay respects.
[4016.80 → 4017.78] It's a COD meme.
[4017.90 → 4018.56] Don't worry about it.
[4019.74 → 4020.62] Don't worry about it.
[4021.34 → 4021.60] Oh,
[4021.70 → 4021.88] okay.
[4023.42 → 4024.18] COD things.
[4025.30 → 4025.62] Um,
[4025.64 → 4025.94] all right,
[4025.94 → 4027.16] so Microsoft condemns
[4027.16 → 4027.60] the U.S.
[4027.68 → 4027.96] government
[4027.96 → 4029.92] in their latest video ad.
[4030.02 → 4030.62] We should show this.
[4030.72 → 4031.70] This is amazing.
[4031.78 → 4032.30] Have you seen it?
[4032.40 → 4032.66] Yeah.
[4032.80 → 4032.96] Oh,
[4032.96 → 4033.26] God.
[4034.46 → 4034.70] Whew.
[4035.52 → 4035.86] They,
[4036.00 → 4037.42] they did not pull
[4037.42 → 4038.76] any punches on this one.
[4038.82 → 4038.94] Oh,
[4038.98 → 4039.42] unfortunately,
[4039.42 → 4040.52] it's not captioned.
[4040.52 → 4040.92] I thought,
[4041.08 → 4041.68] I seem to,
[4041.80 → 4042.98] I thought it was.
[4043.32 → 4043.46] Yeah,
[4043.50 → 4043.92] there it is.
[4044.28 → 4045.18] People and organizations
[4045.18 → 4046.00] rely on the cloud
[4046.00 → 4046.80] to do many of the things
[4046.80 → 4047.34] they care about.
[4047.34 → 4047.74] Basically,
[4047.82 → 4048.20] it's a whole,
[4048.28 → 4049.94] a bunch of touchy-feely footage
[4049.94 → 4050.80] of,
[4050.86 → 4051.08] you know,
[4051.16 → 4051.52] people.
[4051.74 → 4052.54] People are more connected.
[4052.68 → 4053.44] Things are more efficient.
[4053.56 → 4054.40] People like the cloud.
[4054.50 → 4055.22] People use the cloud.
[4055.30 → 4055.50] Blah,
[4055.50 → 4055.66] blah,
[4055.66 → 4055.82] blah,
[4055.82 → 4056.00] blah,
[4056.00 → 4056.18] blah.
[4056.40 → 4057.14] And so,
[4057.22 → 4057.62] basically,
[4057.74 → 4058.60] Microsoft's point
[4058.60 → 4059.44] in this video,
[4059.68 → 4060.20] very,
[4060.36 → 4061.84] very aggressively worded,
[4062.08 → 4063.52] is that just because
[4063.52 → 4064.40] it's data
[4064.40 → 4065.78] doesn't mean
[4065.78 → 4067.16] that it can't be located
[4067.16 → 4068.74] outside your jurisdiction.
[4068.74 → 4069.22] So,
[4069.46 → 4070.10] the U.S.
[4070.18 → 4070.44] government
[4070.44 → 4071.68] is basically trying
[4071.68 → 4072.50] to get some...
[4072.50 → 4072.92] Have you posted this?
[4073.10 → 4073.42] I'm sorry?
[4073.54 → 4074.28] Have you posted this?
[4074.50 → 4075.02] Yes.
[4075.62 → 4075.90] So,
[4075.90 → 4076.16] the U.S.
[4076.22 → 4076.90] government is trying
[4076.90 → 4078.04] to get at some emails
[4078.04 → 4078.66] that Microsoft
[4078.66 → 4079.90] is storing on a server
[4079.90 → 4080.58] in Ireland.
[4080.72 → 4081.62] And instead of working
[4081.62 → 4082.94] through the Irish government
[4082.94 → 4083.88] the way that they
[4083.88 → 4084.60] would have to do it
[4084.60 → 4085.74] if there was someone
[4085.74 → 4087.46] or something physically there...
[4087.46 → 4088.60] They were holding mail there.
[4088.72 → 4089.58] They're just trying
[4089.58 → 4091.18] to get around it
[4091.18 → 4092.56] and do this whole thing
[4092.56 → 4092.92] digitally
[4092.92 → 4093.92] and force Microsoft
[4093.92 → 4095.76] to submit this data
[4095.76 → 4096.14] to them.
[4096.16 → 4096.84] And this is,
[4096.92 → 4098.44] this is really,
[4098.74 → 4099.66] really important
[4099.66 → 4100.62] because
[4100.62 → 4103.00] whether you're American
[4103.00 → 4103.60] or not
[4103.60 → 4104.62] what the U.S.
[4104.68 → 4105.48] does with respect
[4105.48 → 4106.50] to internet policy
[4106.50 → 4107.50] is going to have
[4107.50 → 4108.08] an impact
[4108.08 → 4109.20] on everyone
[4109.20 → 4109.84] especially
[4109.84 → 4111.52] if they win this
[4111.52 → 4112.52] and they're able
[4112.52 → 4113.20] to get access
[4113.20 → 4113.66] to data
[4113.66 → 4114.56] that is not stored
[4114.56 → 4115.38] on American servers
[4115.38 → 4116.40] because that's looking
[4116.40 → 4117.78] like one of the
[4117.78 → 4120.36] only last refuges
[4120.36 → 4121.60] for keeping your data
[4121.60 → 4123.18] safe from the prying
[4123.18 → 4123.74] of the U.S.
[4123.84 → 4124.10] government
[4124.10 → 4125.02] is to store it
[4125.02 → 4125.48] on servers
[4125.48 → 4127.08] that aren't in America.
[4127.92 → 4128.22] And so,
[4128.34 → 4129.18] Apple and Cisco
[4129.18 → 4130.18] said that the text,
[4130.18 → 4131.44] the tech sector
[4131.44 → 4132.92] is put at risk
[4132.92 → 4134.30] of being sanctioned
[4134.30 → 4135.22] by foreign governments
[4135.22 → 4135.92] and the U.S.
[4135.96 → 4137.02] should seek cooperation
[4137.02 → 4138.18] with foreign nations
[4138.18 → 4139.30] via treaties,
[4139.88 → 4140.52] a position
[4140.52 → 4141.52] that the U.S.
[4141.56 → 4143.48] said is not practical.
[4144.02 → 4144.38] I mean,
[4144.60 → 4145.48] Microsoft's point
[4145.48 → 4145.88] in the video,
[4145.92 → 4146.56] and you should watch
[4146.56 → 4147.08] the video,
[4147.32 → 4148.26] is perfect.
[4148.52 → 4149.46] Are people going
[4149.46 → 4150.32] to entrust
[4150.32 → 4151.06] their data
[4151.06 → 4151.94] to the cloud
[4151.94 → 4153.48] if they feel like
[4153.48 → 4154.90] anyone could be
[4154.90 → 4155.56] looking at it?
[4155.84 → 4156.38] No, because,
[4156.70 → 4157.04] I mean,
[4157.10 → 4157.62] are we going to go
[4157.62 → 4158.56] back to snail mail?
[4158.56 → 4159.26] Is that what
[4159.26 → 4159.68] this is going
[4159.68 → 4160.14] to come to?
[4160.58 → 4161.68] Because the last
[4161.68 → 4162.64] time I checked,
[4162.94 → 4163.48] no one's allowed
[4163.48 → 4164.26] to open your mail.
[4164.62 → 4165.38] That's a crime.
[4165.72 → 4165.88] Yeah.
[4166.26 → 4167.42] That's a crime.
[4167.56 → 4168.20] That's the same thing.
[4168.30 → 4169.10] I'm going to jump off
[4169.10 → 4169.78] a little bit right here,
[4169.84 → 4170.44] but it's the same
[4170.44 → 4171.04] kind of idea
[4171.04 → 4171.60] where there was
[4171.60 → 4172.20] something recently
[4172.20 → 4173.14] passed in Canada,
[4173.14 → 4175.44] which is police
[4175.44 → 4176.56] are allowed to
[4176.56 → 4177.00] check out
[4177.00 → 4178.02] the contents
[4178.02 → 4178.70] of your phone
[4178.70 → 4180.82] in relation
[4180.82 → 4181.80] to what they
[4181.80 → 4182.56] arrested you for
[4182.56 → 4183.44] if they arrest you
[4183.44 → 4184.32] without a warrant.
[4184.56 → 4185.30] So they're able
[4185.30 → 4185.90] to look through
[4185.90 → 4186.38] your phone
[4186.38 → 4186.80] for things
[4186.80 → 4187.24] that could have
[4187.24 → 4187.90] something to do
[4187.90 → 4188.72] with what
[4188.72 → 4190.16] you got arrested for
[4190.16 → 4190.88] without getting
[4190.88 → 4191.26] a warrant
[4191.26 → 4191.90] for any reason
[4191.90 → 4192.76] and they're obviously
[4192.76 → 4193.16] going to have to
[4193.16 → 4193.66] look through
[4193.66 → 4194.14] a bunch
[4194.14 → 4194.46] of stuff
[4194.46 → 4195.32] to find things
[4195.32 → 4195.74] that are related
[4195.74 → 4196.16] to what you
[4196.16 → 4196.96] possibly just did.
[4197.16 → 4197.68] So I should just
[4197.68 → 4198.26] make sure
[4198.26 → 4198.86] that there's some
[4198.86 → 4199.98] really awful stuff
[4199.98 → 4200.52] on my phone
[4200.52 → 4200.96] that they don't
[4200.96 → 4201.44] want to see?
[4202.00 → 4202.40] Probably.
[4202.66 → 4203.56] Is that the strategy?
[4203.78 → 4204.28] But like,
[4204.38 → 4205.76] it's crazy
[4205.76 → 4206.36] because like
[4206.36 → 4207.12] if you were speeding
[4207.12 → 4207.86] they could be like,
[4208.00 → 4208.20] well,
[4208.42 → 4209.08] I need to look
[4209.08 → 4210.14] through your text messages
[4210.14 → 4210.96] in entirety
[4210.96 → 4211.70] to figure out
[4211.70 → 4212.68] if you have talked
[4212.68 → 4213.98] about a race
[4213.98 → 4214.54] that you might have
[4214.54 → 4215.22] possibly been in.
[4215.22 → 4216.54] Like that's a potential
[4216.54 → 4217.12] situation
[4217.12 → 4218.38] and all the things
[4218.38 → 4219.28] that are on your phone
[4219.28 → 4220.10] in other forms
[4220.10 → 4221.44] are guarded by warrants.
[4221.56 → 4222.34] You can't check
[4222.34 → 4223.06] someone's mail
[4223.06 → 4223.82] without a warrant.
[4224.14 → 4224.70] You can't check
[4224.70 → 4225.66] someone's phone records
[4225.66 → 4226.52] without a warrant.
[4226.84 → 4227.76] But apparently
[4227.76 → 4228.78] your cell phone
[4228.78 → 4229.74] has nothing to do
[4229.74 → 4230.12] with that
[4230.12 → 4231.22] and that's
[4231.22 → 4232.40] not really okay.
[4232.48 → 4232.94] The problem is
[4232.94 → 4233.40] that the laws
[4233.40 → 4234.20] aren't keeping up
[4234.20 → 4235.88] because five years ago
[4235.88 → 4237.42] that may have actually
[4237.42 → 4238.46] been a valid point
[4238.46 → 4239.28] because a phone
[4239.28 → 4240.36] wouldn't have really,
[4240.50 → 4241.62] maybe not even five,
[4241.72 → 4242.58] maybe eight years ago,
[4242.80 → 4243.64] a phone wouldn't
[4243.64 → 4244.50] have contained
[4244.50 → 4246.24] all of your personal
[4246.24 → 4247.46] financial information
[4247.46 → 4248.06] for example.
[4248.06 → 4248.44] It would have
[4248.44 → 4249.18] your phone records.
[4249.76 → 4250.72] Whereas now,
[4250.88 → 4251.40] which is something
[4251.40 → 4252.00] you need to warrant for.
[4252.96 → 4253.72] Whereas now,
[4253.84 → 4254.32] your phone
[4254.32 → 4254.92] can contain
[4254.92 → 4255.60] a lot of stuff
[4255.60 → 4256.56] that traditionally
[4256.56 → 4257.80] would have only
[4257.80 → 4258.76] been allowed
[4258.76 → 4259.42] to be sent
[4259.42 → 4260.08] by mail
[4260.08 → 4260.82] because of
[4260.82 → 4261.78] security concerns.
[4261.90 → 4262.32] Things like
[4262.32 → 4263.32] credit card statements
[4263.32 → 4265.08] or mortgage documents
[4265.08 → 4265.92] or whatever else.
[4266.08 → 4266.78] Most of which
[4266.78 → 4267.22] can be done
[4267.22 → 4267.90] digitally now.
[4268.94 → 4269.62] So that's like
[4269.62 → 4270.48] a huge deal
[4270.48 → 4270.92] and that happened
[4270.92 → 4271.66] in Canada recently.
[4271.66 → 4272.14] The only reason
[4272.14 → 4272.94] why I brought that up,
[4273.34 → 4274.26] I know I don't really
[4274.26 → 4275.02] bring up Canadian
[4275.02 → 4275.70] politics stuff
[4275.70 → 4276.18] very often.
[4276.40 → 4276.92] Yeah, because no one
[4276.92 → 4277.68] cares about Canada.
[4277.86 → 4278.36] Pretty much.
[4278.98 → 4280.18] But, yeah.
[4281.22 → 4282.30] But it's because
[4282.30 → 4283.12] it's kind of
[4283.12 → 4284.06] similarly related.
[4284.22 → 4285.20] Laws that are coming up
[4285.20 → 4285.78] and things that are
[4285.78 → 4286.56] trying to be done
[4286.56 → 4287.52] that contradict
[4287.52 → 4288.38] and go against
[4288.38 → 4289.04] things that we've
[4289.04 → 4290.12] had for a long time.
[4290.20 → 4290.74] Like needing to
[4290.74 → 4291.46] work with governments
[4291.46 → 4292.18] to do something
[4292.18 → 4293.76] in someone else's soil.
[4294.40 → 4295.74] That's, ah,
[4296.04 → 4296.52] that's been a thing
[4296.52 → 4296.80] forever.
[4297.38 → 4297.92] Yeah, don't touch
[4297.92 → 4298.46] my soil.
[4301.66 → 4303.08] Without my permission.
[4305.12 → 4305.84] Perch buys
[4305.84 → 4306.50] a non-tech.
[4306.60 → 4307.00] So these are
[4307.00 → 4307.70] the same guys
[4307.70 → 4308.76] that own
[4308.76 → 4309.72] Tom's Hardware
[4309.72 → 4310.24] already.
[4310.44 → 4310.92] We'll just fire,
[4310.98 → 4311.52] this was posted
[4311.52 → 4312.46] by Alex Goes High
[4312.46 → 4312.98] on the forum.
[4313.34 → 4314.02] We'll just fire up
[4314.02 → 4314.80] Perch.com.
[4315.22 → 4315.98] So, um,
[4316.08 → 4316.82] I'm not really sure,
[4317.00 → 4317.64] I'm not really sure
[4317.64 → 4318.46] what to think of this
[4318.46 → 4320.26] because, I mean,
[4320.34 → 4320.92] some of the stuff
[4320.92 → 4322.60] that I hear
[4322.60 → 4323.72] about Tom's Hardware
[4323.72 → 4324.72] would go a little
[4324.72 → 4325.22] bit deeper
[4325.22 → 4326.04] than what actually
[4326.04 → 4327.26] appears on their
[4327.26 → 4328.28] website with respect
[4328.28 → 4328.96] to, you know,
[4329.02 → 4329.90] what advertiser
[4329.90 → 4331.02] relationships are like
[4331.02 → 4331.42] with them.
[4332.02 → 4333.60] Um, I mean,
[4333.74 → 4334.70] a good thing,
[4334.78 → 4335.32] and so there's a
[4335.32 → 4335.98] statement from
[4335.98 → 4336.58] Ryan Smith
[4336.58 → 4337.30] who took over
[4337.30 → 4338.30] for Anand,
[4338.48 → 4339.28] the guy who started
[4339.28 → 4340.16] Anand Tech.
[4340.68 → 4341.68] Um, so they have
[4341.68 → 4342.58] a statement from him,
[4342.74 → 4343.24] blah, blah, blah,
[4343.32 → 4343.86] grown by leaps
[4343.86 → 4344.44] and bounds.
[4344.66 → 4345.84] We are nearing
[4345.84 → 4347.54] what is possible
[4347.54 → 4348.66] as an independent
[4348.66 → 4349.34] company.
[4349.58 → 4350.48] The challenge has
[4350.48 → 4351.08] always been that
[4351.08 → 4351.72] there are very few
[4351.72 → 4352.28] players in the
[4352.28 → 4353.06] publishing space
[4353.06 → 4353.72] these days who
[4353.72 → 4354.52] value deep,
[4354.66 → 4355.78] high-quality content.
[4355.90 → 4356.48] We wanted a partner
[4356.48 → 4357.32] that understood our
[4357.32 → 4359.30] values and had a
[4359.30 → 4360.14] sound business model,
[4360.14 → 4360.94] et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[4361.00 → 4361.66] So basically,
[4362.32 → 4363.86] they wanted someone
[4363.86 → 4366.52] to support their
[4366.52 → 4368.76] business and find
[4368.76 → 4370.86] advertisers and find
[4370.86 → 4372.16] deals for them that
[4372.16 → 4373.06] would allow them to,
[4373.12 → 4373.78] you know, pay their
[4373.78 → 4375.16] salaries and do their
[4375.16 → 4375.68] jobs.
[4376.24 → 4376.90] Um, so they wanted
[4376.90 → 4378.28] someone who appreciated
[4378.28 → 4379.58] how much more work
[4379.58 → 4380.88] goes into a single
[4380.88 → 4382.20] article at Anand Tech
[4382.20 → 4383.92] versus at, you know,
[4383.98 → 4384.58] let's say,
[4384.82 → 4386.24] Gizmodo or Engadget
[4386.24 → 4387.36] or something like
[4387.36 → 4387.48] that.
[4387.52 → 4388.08] And I'm not saying
[4388.08 → 4389.02] no one at Engadget
[4389.02 → 4389.80] works hard on an
[4389.80 → 4390.10] article.
[4390.26 → 4390.74] That's not the
[4390.74 → 4391.30] statement I'm making
[4391.30 → 4391.58] at all.
[4391.64 → 4392.26] I'm saying that
[4392.26 → 4394.10] typically, you know,
[4394.16 → 4395.48] word for word,
[4395.48 → 4396.48] there's going to be
[4396.48 → 4397.76] more of them in the
[4397.76 → 4398.50] Anand Tech article
[4398.50 → 4399.68] and they will often
[4399.68 → 4401.24] have more research
[4401.24 → 4402.38] and more benchmarking
[4402.38 → 4402.72] and numbers.
[4402.92 → 4403.18] They're a different
[4403.18 → 4403.80] style.
[4403.96 → 4404.52] Anand Tech is going
[4404.52 → 4405.16] to be a long,
[4405.22 → 4406.56] a long form,
[4406.86 → 4408.50] extremely in-depth,
[4408.62 → 4409.30] informative style
[4409.30 → 4409.62] stuff.
[4409.70 → 4411.04] Stuff like Engadget is
[4411.04 → 4411.86] going to be fairly
[4411.86 → 4412.22] quick.
[4412.62 → 4413.02] Digestible.
[4413.18 → 4413.70] Yes, you're going
[4413.70 → 4414.18] to get the news
[4414.18 → 4415.08] quickly, and it's
[4415.08 → 4415.52] going to be fairly
[4415.52 → 4416.02] quick to be able
[4416.02 → 4416.44] to read.
[4416.96 → 4417.30] It's not a
[4418.00 → 4418.80] yeah, yeah.
[4419.68 → 4420.94] So there you go.
[4421.06 → 4421.88] Anand Tech represents
[4421.88 → 4422.76] much of my life's
[4422.76 → 4423.46] work over the past
[4423.46 → 4424.14] 18 years,
[4424.26 → 4425.18] said Anand Sh impi,
[4425.26 → 4425.72] the founder.
[4426.10 → 4426.84] I'm happy to see it
[4426.84 → 4427.58] end up with a partner
[4427.58 → 4428.28] committed to taking
[4428.28 → 4428.88] good care of the
[4428.88 → 4429.58] brand and its readers.
[4429.70 → 4430.22] I wouldn't have had
[4430.22 → 4431.00] it any other way.
[4431.38 → 4432.14] With all of that
[4432.14 → 4433.18] said, it's not like
[4433.18 → 4434.34] Ryan or Anand had
[4434.34 → 4435.56] any choice but to
[4435.56 → 4437.00] make really positive
[4437.00 → 4437.86] statements about it.
[4437.88 → 4438.66] And I'm sure if I
[4438.66 → 4440.18] was selling Linus Media
[4440.18 → 4441.86] Group to AT&T or
[4441.86 → 4442.62] something, I would
[4442.62 → 4443.96] spin it as the most
[4443.96 → 4444.90] positive possible
[4444.90 → 4446.28] thing for Linus
[4446.28 → 4447.14] Media Group and its
[4447.14 → 4448.00] employees and its
[4448.00 → 4448.26] viewers.
[4448.78 → 4450.84] But who knows?
[4450.96 → 4451.52] Might be great.
[4451.66 → 4452.32] Might be fine.
[4452.54 → 4453.40] Tom's hardware hasn't
[4453.40 → 4454.10] imploded yet.
[4454.90 → 4456.22] So there you go.
[4457.22 → 4460.10] If we sold to AT&T,
[4460.18 → 4461.42] I would just become a
[4461.42 → 4461.58] monk.
[4461.92 → 4462.76] You'd become a monk?
[4462.96 → 4463.20] Yeah.
[4463.20 → 4463.98] Well, I'd be a nun.
[4463.98 → 4468.74] I had a few people
[4468.74 → 4470.60] sort of accuse Anand
[4470.60 → 4471.76] Tech of selling out.
[4472.06 → 4472.66] You know what?
[4473.02 → 4474.90] Selling the business is
[4474.90 → 4476.42] not necessarily the same
[4476.42 → 4478.10] thing as selling out.
[4478.24 → 4480.48] I mean, yes, Anand left
[4480.48 → 4480.94] the site.
[4481.14 → 4482.14] I think that he left it
[4482.14 → 4483.50] in fairly capable hands
[4483.50 → 4485.44] based on my interactions
[4485.44 → 4486.30] with the guys that are
[4486.30 → 4487.40] there, reading the
[4487.40 → 4488.28] articles written by the
[4488.28 → 4489.12] guys that are there.
[4489.58 → 4490.90] And ultimately, content
[4490.90 → 4491.44] is king.
[4491.44 → 4492.08] And then if they've
[4492.08 → 4493.10] found a partner that's
[4493.10 → 4494.96] going to own the site,
[4495.04 → 4495.48] that's going to make
[4495.48 → 4496.44] sure that it's monetized
[4496.44 → 4497.70] correctly, then, you
[4497.70 → 4499.04] know, I don't think he's
[4499.04 → 4500.44] sold out so much as
[4500.44 → 4502.32] sold, which is not
[4502.32 → 4503.10] really the same thing.
[4503.52 → 4504.34] And then I had people
[4504.34 → 4505.40] discussing in the forum
[4505.40 → 4506.34] thread on this topic
[4506.34 → 4507.76] whether, you know, if
[4507.76 → 4509.48] Linus was going to sell
[4509.48 → 4510.36] out or whatever else,
[4510.44 → 4511.50] like, no, I intend to
[4511.50 → 4512.32] run Linus Media Group
[4512.32 → 4513.44] for a really long time.
[4513.64 → 4515.60] But one thing that I will
[4515.60 → 4517.54] say is, you know, talk
[4517.54 → 4519.32] to me 17 years from now
[4519.32 → 4521.04] and maybe I feel a
[4521.04 → 4521.48] little differently.
[4521.60 → 4522.40] Maybe I'm ready for a
[4522.40 → 4523.52] new challenge and, you
[4523.52 → 4526.70] know, the younger, more
[4526.70 → 4528.48] invigorated team that I
[4528.48 → 4529.46] left behind is ready to
[4529.46 → 4530.24] run Linus Media Group
[4530.24 → 4530.66] on its own.
[4530.66 → 4533.56] My goal is going to be
[4533.56 → 4534.98] and yours, and I think
[4534.98 → 4536.56] everyone here, is that we
[4536.56 → 4538.14] are Linus Media Group,
[4538.72 → 4539.70] not necessarily just
[4539.70 → 4540.28] Linus Tech Tips.
[4540.36 → 4541.08] We've done stuff like
[4541.08 → 4541.64] Tech Quickie.
[4542.08 → 4542.72] We've tried to make
[4542.72 → 4544.28] things that are still
[4544.28 → 4545.48] fascinating to us.
[4545.94 → 4547.12] People like Super Fun.
[4547.18 → 4548.08] We started Super Fun.
[4548.08 → 4550.22] But we're not just one
[4550.22 → 4551.24] singular website.
[4551.56 → 4552.70] And we might not always
[4552.70 → 4553.88] just be video, even.
[4554.18 → 4554.38] Yeah.
[4554.62 → 4555.02] Who knows?
[4556.50 → 4557.30] We're going to keep
[4557.30 → 4558.56] evolving, and I'm going to
[4558.56 → 4559.34] try and keep this dude
[4559.34 → 4559.72] interested.
[4560.40 → 4561.02] And I think he's going to
[4561.02 → 4561.86] try and keep everyone else
[4561.86 → 4562.36] here interested.
[4563.32 → 4563.52] So...
[4563.52 → 4564.08] That whip.
[4564.92 → 4565.94] Nothing keeps people
[4565.94 → 4567.06] more interested than a whip.
[4567.52 → 4570.28] That nun costume just got
[4570.28 → 4571.40] real interested.
[4571.40 → 4574.44] All right.
[4574.54 → 4575.96] Posted on the forum by
[4575.96 → 4577.74] XtankSlayerX.
[4577.82 → 4579.16] I'm sharing this one.
[4579.48 → 4580.68] Hatred was removed from
[4580.68 → 4583.34] Steam Greenlight for a
[4583.34 → 4583.74] day.
[4584.12 → 4585.16] Well, a day after its
[4585.16 → 4585.52] launch.
[4586.06 → 4587.34] And, oh, apparently I'm
[4587.34 → 4588.26] not a member of their
[4588.26 → 4589.52] forum, so I won't be
[4589.52 → 4590.58] viewing that particular
[4590.58 → 4591.00] topic.
[4591.20 → 4591.66] All right, then.
[4591.80 → 4593.10] Let's try the next link
[4593.10 → 4593.36] here.
[4594.00 → 4594.94] And I can't bring that
[4594.94 → 4595.40] one up either.
[4595.48 → 4595.98] Well, whatever.
[4596.08 → 4596.80] There's nothing that I
[4596.80 → 4598.18] can do for you guys.
[4598.18 → 4599.88] So our source here,
[4600.50 → 4601.68] XtankSlayerX posted this
[4601.68 → 4603.80] and it's forums.hatredgame.com
[4603.80 → 4605.46] and basically it was
[4605.46 → 4606.18] pulled down.
[4606.68 → 4607.90] Gabe Newell himself
[4607.90 → 4609.24] reinstated the game on
[4609.24 → 4610.40] Greenlight one day
[4610.40 → 4610.76] later.
[4610.92 → 4611.58] So that was December
[4611.58 → 4613.38] 16th and personally
[4613.38 → 4614.86] emailed the creator to
[4614.86 → 4616.86] apologize and inform him
[4616.86 → 4617.72] that the game was to be
[4617.72 → 4618.94] placed back on Steam
[4618.94 → 4619.50] Greenlight.
[4619.72 → 4621.14] In the letter, he said,
[4621.56 → 4622.52] since I wasn't up to
[4622.52 → 4623.78] speed on why this
[4623.78 → 4626.40] decision was made, I
[4626.40 → 4627.94] asked around internally to
[4627.94 → 4629.24] find out why we had
[4629.24 → 4630.66] done that, taking
[4630.66 → 4631.66] Hatred down.
[4632.02 → 4632.96] It turns out that it
[4632.96 → 4634.10] wasn't a good decision
[4634.10 → 4634.90] and we'll be putting
[4634.90 → 4636.08] Hatred back up.
[4636.18 → 4637.14] My apologies to you and
[4637.14 → 4637.54] your team.
[4637.86 → 4638.74] Steam is creating tools
[4638.74 → 4639.68] for content creators
[4639.68 → 4640.62] and customers.
[4640.84 → 4641.88] Good luck with your
[4641.88 → 4642.20] game.
[4642.32 → 4647.42] Now, I guess I see why
[4647.42 → 4648.06] it might have been
[4648.06 → 4648.38] pulled.
[4648.96 → 4649.76] Hatred is a game where
[4649.76 → 4650.56] you play as the
[4650.56 → 4651.26] antagonist.
[4651.38 → 4652.54] Basically, you're a
[4652.54 → 4653.66] mass murderer and you
[4653.66 → 4654.92] go on a killing spree.
[4655.08 → 4655.96] The entire point of the
[4655.96 → 4656.60] game is to kill
[4656.60 → 4657.76] innocent civilians and
[4657.76 → 4658.56] police officers.
[4659.84 → 4661.00] Steam pulled the game
[4661.00 → 4662.52] just hours after it was
[4662.52 → 4664.62] launched and VP of
[4664.62 → 4665.30] marketing at Valve
[4665.30 → 4666.36] stated, based on what
[4666.36 → 4667.40] we've seen on Greenlight,
[4667.50 → 4668.40] we would not publish
[4668.40 → 4669.38] Hatred on Steam.
[4669.46 → 4670.02] As such, we'll be
[4670.02 → 4671.38] taking it down without
[4671.38 → 4672.22] really elaborating on
[4672.22 → 4672.60] the decision.
[4672.68 → 4673.94] In fact, we still don't
[4673.94 → 4675.26] know exactly why the
[4675.26 → 4676.60] decision was made at
[4676.60 → 4677.58] Valve to pull it down.
[4677.66 → 4678.46] We just know that Gabe
[4678.46 → 4679.90] Newell came in and
[4679.90 → 4681.30] stomped in the way that
[4681.30 → 4682.18] only someone who weighs
[4682.18 → 4683.06] as much as Gabe Newell
[4683.06 → 4683.46] can.
[4683.80 → 4684.84] Sorry, I love you, Gabe.
[4684.84 → 4685.96] Winter Sale is amazing.
[4686.80 → 4687.62] Sorry, I shouldn't take
[4687.62 → 4688.32] shots at you for
[4688.32 → 4688.88] weighing a lot.
[4691.44 → 4692.86] And now it's back up.
[4692.98 → 4694.50] So this is one that,
[4694.70 → 4695.44] I don't know, what are
[4695.44 → 4696.68] your personal feelings?
[4696.92 → 4699.18] Should there be a limit
[4699.18 → 4701.86] to what Valve should be
[4701.86 → 4704.54] willing to publish on
[4704.54 → 4705.24] Steam?
[4705.24 → 4706.58] I think they just need to
[4706.58 → 4709.22] have, I guess, better
[4709.22 → 4710.52] predefined metrics.
[4710.52 → 4712.38] like, you're running a
[4712.38 → 4712.76] store.
[4712.94 → 4714.00] You can decide what you
[4714.00 → 4714.66] want to be in your
[4714.66 → 4714.84] store.
[4714.94 → 4715.92] And of course, there's
[4715.92 → 4716.94] this weird thing where
[4716.94 → 4717.92] people can vote stuff
[4717.92 → 4719.08] in, but you still have
[4719.08 → 4719.62] veto power.
[4719.74 → 4720.66] You should be able to
[4720.66 → 4721.44] remove things.
[4723.20 → 4725.04] And this becomes a
[4725.04 → 4726.14] fairly interesting thing
[4726.14 → 4727.10] where a lot of internet
[4727.10 → 4728.16] platforms are seen as
[4728.16 → 4729.72] public resources instead
[4729.72 → 4730.34] of companies.
[4730.68 → 4731.90] And this happens a lot.
[4732.12 → 4733.70] And, like, they should
[4733.70 → 4734.84] do this and then
[4734.84 → 4735.52] everyone will get very
[4735.52 → 4736.10] mad at them because
[4736.10 → 4737.00] they didn't do something
[4737.00 → 4737.58] the way they wanted
[4737.58 → 4738.86] them to while it's a
[4738.86 → 4739.72] company still.
[4740.52 → 4742.12] Um, it's, it's, it's
[4742.12 → 4742.50] an interesting
[4742.50 → 4743.12] conversation.
[4743.32 → 4743.96] I think they should
[4743.96 → 4744.74] have better defined
[4744.74 → 4745.18] metrics.
[4745.18 → 4746.80] Like, okay, if your
[4746.80 → 4748.62] game is specifically
[4748.62 → 4751.60] about mass murder and
[4751.60 → 4752.64] specifically about
[4752.64 → 4753.30] killing innocent
[4753.30 → 4754.00] civilians and
[4754.00 → 4755.02] specifically about
[4755.02 → 4756.08] killing police officers
[4756.08 → 4758.28] who weren't doing
[4758.28 → 4759.36] anything wrong.
[4759.52 → 4760.02] Other than their
[4760.02 → 4760.40] jobs.
[4760.50 → 4761.04] Their jobs.
[4761.16 → 4762.36] And, like, specifically
[4762.36 → 4764.64] designed to be a game
[4764.64 → 4765.46] about essentially
[4765.46 → 4766.58] genocide and
[4766.58 → 4767.72] specifically designed
[4767.72 → 4768.70] for these things,
[4768.70 → 4770.38] maybe we don't want
[4770.38 → 4771.20] that on our service.
[4771.30 → 4772.46] And if that exists, if
[4772.46 → 4773.28] that is a metric that
[4773.28 → 4774.30] they have, then I think
[4774.30 → 4774.70] it's okay.
[4774.82 → 4776.04] It wasn't.
[4776.38 → 4777.62] Yeah, because there
[4777.62 → 4779.82] are games like GTA 5
[4779.82 → 4781.34] or Watch Dogs where
[4781.34 → 4782.66] you can run around and
[4782.66 → 4783.96] gun down civilians and
[4783.96 → 4785.24] gun down police officers
[4785.24 → 4787.00] with, I guess, the
[4787.00 → 4788.42] justification for that
[4788.42 → 4789.82] being that the rules
[4789.82 → 4791.12] of the world do
[4791.12 → 4792.02] somewhat apply.
[4792.44 → 4793.36] You know, they'll send
[4793.36 → 4795.44] bigger and bigger law
[4795.44 → 4796.68] enforcement after you
[4796.68 → 4798.10] and, you know, or the
[4798.10 → 4799.40] public can turn against
[4799.40 → 4800.76] you and watch dogs or
[4800.76 → 4801.16] whatever else.
[4801.22 → 4802.40] Like, it's not considered
[4802.40 → 4803.94] something that the
[4803.94 → 4806.96] player is rewarded for.
[4807.10 → 4807.70] Yeah, and it's not
[4807.70 → 4809.20] necessarily your specific
[4809.20 → 4809.56] goal.
[4809.66 → 4810.16] It's definitely something
[4810.16 → 4811.06] you can partake in the
[4811.06 → 4811.26] game.
[4811.36 → 4812.24] It's definitely something
[4812.24 → 4812.66] you can do.
[4812.78 → 4813.92] A game like Armageddon,
[4814.16 → 4814.78] you could make the
[4814.78 → 4815.94] argument it's a racing
[4815.94 → 4816.34] game.
[4818.28 → 4819.22] It would be a weak
[4819.22 → 4820.24] argument, but you could
[4820.24 → 4821.62] make the argument that it
[4821.62 → 4823.18] is a racing game.
[4823.38 → 4824.74] But this game specifically
[4824.74 → 4826.72] is like, yes, please
[4826.72 → 4827.78] kill innocent people.
[4828.06 → 4829.44] People are bringing up
[4829.44 → 4831.04] Manhunt as an example
[4831.04 → 4831.30] of these.
[4831.30 → 4832.16] There's a couple.
[4832.28 → 4833.14] There's Manhunt, there's
[4833.14 → 4834.12] that other one that I
[4834.12 → 4834.64] can't remember the name
[4834.64 → 4834.98] of.
[4836.92 → 4837.40] Postal?
[4837.96 → 4838.40] I think it's called
[4838.40 → 4839.00] Postal.
[4839.36 → 4840.52] Cough, Payday 2.
[4840.94 → 4841.92] So yes, there are
[4841.92 → 4843.10] examples of stuff like
[4843.10 → 4844.54] this, but I guess
[4844.54 → 4845.68] basically the problem is
[4845.68 → 4847.58] that Valve didn't draw
[4847.58 → 4848.84] the line, and you don't
[4848.84 → 4849.68] get to draw the line
[4849.68 → 4850.34] after the fact.
[4850.40 → 4851.74] So I suspect right now
[4851.74 → 4853.62] they're in the process of
[4853.62 → 4854.80] internal meetings about
[4854.80 → 4855.36] where they're going to
[4855.36 → 4856.18] draw the line, because
[4856.18 → 4857.82] let's say, for example,
[4857.98 → 4859.24] that Hatred had been
[4859.24 → 4861.06] baby Hatred, and the
[4861.06 → 4862.80] entire game was, you
[4862.80 → 4864.02] know, like AAA
[4864.02 → 4865.94] graphics, tearing apart
[4865.94 → 4866.88] babies in front of
[4866.88 → 4867.98] their mothers, and then
[4867.98 → 4869.08] you know, committing
[4869.08 → 4871.22] sexual assault on the
[4871.22 → 4872.14] like, like you could
[4872.14 → 4873.04] come up with a game
[4873.04 → 4874.42] that literally shouldn't
[4874.42 → 4875.28] be allowed to be
[4875.28 → 4877.10] published anywhere, and
[4877.10 → 4878.42] I think Valve just has
[4878.42 → 4880.12] to define where their
[4880.12 → 4881.28] line in the sand is
[4881.28 → 4881.86] going to be drawn.
[4881.86 → 4882.22] Especially now that
[4882.22 → 4882.86] they have a voting
[4882.86 → 4883.24] system.
[4883.48 → 4884.90] They need to come up
[4884.90 → 4885.98] with predefined metrics
[4885.98 → 4887.30] for what cannot get
[4887.30 → 4887.86] through the voting
[4887.86 → 4888.72] system and what they're
[4888.72 → 4889.34] going to veto.
[4890.84 → 4891.86] I think there wasn't
[4891.86 → 4892.64] enough communication
[4892.64 → 4893.86] here on Valve's side
[4893.86 → 4895.40] as to those types of
[4895.40 → 4897.60] things, and I think if
[4897.60 → 4898.52] they wanted to pull
[4898.52 → 4899.50] something like Hatred
[4899.50 → 4900.74] down, they should have
[4900.74 → 4902.18] pulled, sorry, they
[4902.18 → 4902.54] should have pulled
[4902.54 → 4903.62] related games down.
[4903.70 → 4904.46] People brought up that,
[4905.22 → 4906.54] I don't know, I haven't
[4906.54 → 4907.58] looked for it, because
[4907.58 → 4908.56] I'm not interested in
[4908.56 → 4910.08] this, but people brought
[4910.08 → 4911.26] up that I think Postal's
[4911.26 → 4912.14] on Steam or something.
[4912.52 → 4913.54] So if they wanted to
[4913.54 → 4914.98] do this, they probably
[4914.98 → 4915.70] should have taken down
[4915.70 → 4916.28] games that were
[4916.28 → 4916.98] essentially the same
[4916.98 → 4917.34] idea.
[4919.06 → 4919.58] But, yeah.
[4919.72 → 4920.58] Okay, so let's move
[4920.58 → 4921.30] on to something a little
[4921.30 → 4921.88] bit more fun.
[4921.96 → 4923.00] This was, the original
[4923.00 → 4923.88] article is from the
[4923.88 → 4924.46] Tech Report.
[4924.80 → 4925.24] All right, can you
[4925.24 → 4925.58] post that?
[4925.90 → 4926.08] Yeah.
[4926.08 → 4927.24] And this was posted
[4927.24 → 4928.52] by Ah Ming on the
[4928.52 → 4929.38] forum, and this looks
[4929.38 → 4930.90] actually pretty awesome.
[4930.96 → 4931.82] I really like this
[4931.82 → 4931.92] thing.
[4931.92 → 4933.10] So, Lian Li is using
[4933.10 → 4934.60] flexible PCI Express
[4934.60 → 4935.26] extensions.
[4935.26 → 4936.92] I sure wish they would
[4936.92 → 4937.94] do an external power
[4937.94 → 4938.62] supply and make them
[4938.62 → 4940.38] smaller, as well as
[4940.38 → 4942.26] glass, so tempered glass
[4942.26 → 4944.26] panels, and wall
[4944.26 → 4945.58] mounting support to
[4945.58 → 4946.52] make some pretty
[4946.52 → 4948.30] amazing and unique
[4948.30 → 4949.06] cases.
[4949.32 → 4950.68] These look fantastic.
[4951.26 → 4952.16] Looked really nice.
[4952.30 → 4953.48] Now, okay, that one's
[4953.48 → 4953.98] a little big.
[4954.32 → 4954.92] That one's a little
[4954.92 → 4955.14] big.
[4955.22 → 4956.16] So, just for context,
[4956.16 → 4957.36] guys, here, this is a
[4957.36 → 4958.08] three and a half inch
[4958.08 → 4958.46] drive.
[4958.80 → 4959.84] This is a full-sized
[4959.84 → 4961.22] ATX power supply, and
[4961.22 → 4962.32] this is a full-sized
[4962.32 → 4964.12] gaming-grade graphics
[4964.12 → 4965.26] card looks like an
[4965.26 → 4966.42] ASUS Strip or
[4966.42 → 4967.18] something like that.
[4967.26 → 4968.32] And that's a full-sized
[4968.32 → 4969.12] ATX board.
[4969.34 → 4970.50] Give me this basic
[4970.50 → 4971.44] concept with an
[4971.44 → 4972.44] IT board.
[4972.62 → 4973.22] Yep, they have
[4973.22 → 4973.42] that.
[4973.86 → 4975.46] Yeah, so, where
[4975.46 → 4975.80] is it?
[4975.94 → 4976.38] Oh, whatever.
[4976.54 → 4976.88] I think it's up.
[4976.94 → 4977.40] I think it's the
[4977.40 → 4978.32] original picture.
[4978.44 → 4978.94] Yeah, there we go.
[4978.98 → 4980.00] So, give me the same
[4980.00 → 4981.58] basic concept, except
[4981.58 → 4982.64] tone it down even
[4982.64 → 4982.86] more.
[4982.92 → 4983.30] I don't need a
[4983.30 → 4983.72] three and a half
[4983.72 → 4984.32] inch drive.
[4984.42 → 4984.94] I don't want a
[4984.94 → 4985.96] power supply internally.
[4986.08 → 4986.66] All this stuff.
[4987.00 → 4987.92] And this is a
[4987.92 → 4988.94] really, really cool
[4988.94 → 4989.36] concept.
[4990.40 → 4991.38] I think my mom
[4991.38 → 4991.98] might be calling.
[4992.32 → 4993.20] Oh, Lord.
[4993.28 → 4993.88] Do we answer
[4993.88 → 4994.62] what she has to
[4994.62 → 4995.22] say about murder
[4995.22 → 4995.50] games?
[4995.62 → 4997.16] I really think it's
[4997.16 → 4997.84] a bad idea.
[4998.22 → 4998.52] Okay.
[4998.74 → 4999.42] Sorry, mom.
[4999.64 → 5000.68] We probably know
[5000.68 → 5001.38] what your stance is
[5001.38 → 5002.10] on murder games.
[5002.88 → 5004.14] We're going to go with
[5004.14 → 5004.84] mom doesn't like
[5004.84 → 5005.44] murder games.
[5006.32 → 5007.24] My mom doesn't
[5007.24 → 5007.98] like murder games
[5007.98 → 5008.24] either.
[5008.34 → 5008.90] My mom doesn't
[5008.90 → 5009.54] like games in
[5009.54 → 5009.84] general.
[5010.40 → 5010.58] Oh.
[5010.82 → 5011.40] My mom likes
[5011.40 → 5011.82] games.
[5011.98 → 5012.72] I think the only
[5012.72 → 5012.90] game...
[5012.90 → 5013.30] My mom played
[5013.30 → 5013.82] Skyrim and
[5013.82 → 5014.38] WoW and stuff.
[5014.74 → 5015.54] I think the only
[5015.54 → 5016.50] game a member of
[5016.50 → 5017.46] my family ever
[5017.46 → 5018.94] bought for me was
[5018.94 → 5020.38] I got the Warcraft
[5020.38 → 5021.18] 2 battle chest
[5021.18 → 5022.02] from my grandparents
[5022.02 → 5023.14] and they never
[5023.14 → 5023.72] got me a game
[5023.72 → 5024.40] again because I'm
[5024.40 → 5025.10] pretty sure my mom
[5025.10 → 5025.78] gave them heck
[5025.78 → 5027.10] when I wasn't
[5027.10 → 5027.38] looking.
[5029.56 → 5030.36] My mom used to
[5030.36 → 5031.04] play WoW and I
[5031.04 → 5031.58] remember one time
[5031.58 → 5033.08] she got ranked in
[5033.08 → 5034.74] I'm going to say the
[5034.74 → 5035.30] wrong thing, but it's
[5035.30 → 5036.02] a forest area.
[5036.48 → 5036.80] Strangle thorn?
[5036.96 → 5037.12] No.
[5037.30 → 5037.60] I don't know.
[5037.64 → 5037.82] Whatever.
[5037.90 → 5038.24] It doesn't matter.
[5038.76 → 5039.88] And my like whole
[5039.88 → 5040.82] guild went and
[5040.82 → 5041.38] protected her.
[5041.48 → 5041.62] No.
[5041.86 → 5042.28] Just kidding.
[5042.36 → 5042.74] Not at all.
[5043.24 → 5044.28] My whole guild went
[5044.28 → 5045.44] and protected her and
[5045.44 → 5046.12] it was like the mom
[5046.12 → 5047.66] defence league and we
[5047.66 → 5048.34] made sure that she
[5048.34 → 5049.22] couldn't get ranked by
[5049.22 → 5049.74] other people.
[5050.10 → 5050.86] It was fantastic.
[5052.84 → 5053.28] Wow.
[5053.52 → 5053.88] Anyway.
[5054.12 → 5054.26] Oh.
[5054.76 → 5054.98] Oh.
[5055.78 → 5056.00] Oh.
[5057.86 → 5058.86] So the Pirate
[5058.86 → 5061.46] Bay shut down is a
[5061.46 → 5062.82] lesson in futility.
[5063.14 → 5063.50] Sorry.
[5063.72 → 5064.80] Got lots of articles
[5064.80 → 5066.24] from Variety.com.
[5066.30 → 5066.92] This was posted by
[5066.92 → 5067.90] Powder Banks on the
[5067.90 → 5069.66] forum and in a
[5069.66 → 5071.44] nutshell it affected
[5071.44 → 5073.08] so you guys may or
[5073.08 → 5073.92] may not know this but
[5073.92 → 5074.86] the official Pirate
[5074.86 → 5076.38] Bay was the servers
[5076.38 → 5077.50] were raided.
[5077.50 → 5078.84] it's like
[5078.84 → 5080.22] la la shut down.
[5080.48 → 5080.56] Yeah.
[5080.62 → 5082.02] It has had virtually
[5082.02 → 5083.72] no effect on digital
[5083.72 → 5084.82] piracy levels
[5084.82 → 5086.56] whatsoever.
[5087.36 → 5087.66] Okay.
[5088.04 → 5089.58] There is an effect
[5089.58 → 5091.64] but it was small
[5091.64 → 5093.22] and probably not
[5093.22 → 5093.68] lasting.
[5093.90 → 5095.66] So my onscreen
[5095.66 → 5096.66] keyboard is like
[5096.66 → 5097.84] is this can you
[5097.84 → 5098.84] just can you
[5098.84 → 5099.78] just not
[5099.78 → 5100.92] XPS?
[5100.92 → 5101.02] You could have
[5101.02 → 5101.54] just pressed the
[5101.54 → 5102.10] X on it.
[5102.20 → 5102.86] No it would
[5102.86 → 5103.30] because it keeps
[5103.30 → 5104.24] coming back if I
[5104.24 → 5105.02] don't flip the
[5105.02 → 5105.16] screen.
[5105.48 → 5106.30] It doesn't happen
[5106.30 → 5107.06] very often but
[5107.06 → 5108.14] during the show
[5108.14 → 5108.74] Did you post this?
[5109.04 → 5109.62] So total
[5109.62 → 5110.26] no I didn't
[5110.26 → 5110.60] if you want to
[5110.60 → 5110.88] go ahead and
[5110.88 → 5111.18] post that.
[5111.78 → 5112.98] Total BitTorrent
[5112.98 → 5114.18] users barely
[5114.18 → 5115.24] dropped during the
[5115.24 → 5115.84] Pirate Bay's
[5115.84 → 5116.32] downtime.
[5117.10 → 5119.36] So 101.5 million
[5119.36 → 5120.20] users on December
[5120.20 → 5121.56] 8th one day prior
[5121.56 → 5122.36] to the Swedish law
[5122.36 → 5123.06] enforcement takedown
[5123.06 → 5123.58] of the Pirate Bay
[5123.58 → 5124.76] reached an overall
[5124.76 → 5126.46] low of 95 million
[5126.46 → 5127.26] users on December
[5127.26 → 5128.54] 10th back up to
[5128.54 → 5129.76] 100.2 million
[5129.76 → 5130.70] users on Friday
[5130.70 → 5132.64] December the 12th.
[5132.88 → 5134.04] Daily average since
[5134.04 → 5134.92] November 1st is
[5134.92 → 5136.58] roughly 99.9
[5136.58 → 5137.74] million and it
[5137.74 → 5138.96] takes so much
[5138.96 → 5140.02] effort to take
[5140.02 → 5140.96] down even one
[5140.96 → 5141.94] site and when
[5141.94 → 5142.80] they do it there
[5142.80 → 5143.22] are going to be
[5143.22 → 5144.06] dozens to take
[5144.06 → 5144.52] its place.
[5144.66 → 5145.32] The ISO hunt
[5145.32 → 5146.30] guys were hosting
[5146.30 → 5147.56] the Pirate Bay on
[5147.56 → 5148.42] their own mirrored
[5148.42 → 5150.68] server like you
[5150.68 → 5152.22] are not going to
[5152.22 → 5153.92] stop piracy.
[5154.50 → 5155.56] There has to be a
[5155.56 → 5156.34] better way.
[5156.52 → 5158.66] I mean Google
[5158.66 → 5159.92] Play Music turned
[5159.92 → 5162.00] me into a 100%
[5162.00 → 5163.04] paid music user.
[5163.04 → 5164.26] I will happily
[5164.26 → 5166.08] happily spend my
[5166.08 → 5167.64] monthly subscription
[5167.64 → 5168.58] fee on Google
[5168.58 → 5169.30] Play Music because
[5169.30 → 5170.62] that is how I want
[5170.62 → 5171.92] to use it and if
[5171.92 → 5172.76] you give people the
[5172.76 → 5173.96] option to use content
[5173.96 → 5174.62] the way they want to
[5174.62 → 5175.72] use if I think they
[5175.72 → 5176.50] will pay for it.
[5176.86 → 5178.10] I am a personally
[5178.10 → 5179.70] reformed music
[5179.70 → 5180.08] pirate.
[5180.86 → 5182.38] I own like six
[5182.38 → 5183.70] CDs total.
[5184.14 → 5185.54] That medium didn't
[5185.54 → 5186.08] work for me.
[5186.26 → 5186.90] I wasn't going to
[5186.90 → 5189.18] pay you $24.99 for
[5189.18 → 5190.28] the one song that I
[5190.28 → 5191.24] wanted on that
[5191.24 → 5192.50] album because quite
[5192.50 → 5194.16] frankly most of what
[5194.16 → 5194.92] someone like Britney
[5194.92 → 5196.28] Spears does is
[5196.28 → 5197.48] garbage but if I
[5197.48 → 5198.22] wanted To be Hit Me Baby
[5198.22 → 5199.52] one more time I
[5199.52 → 5200.64] had to pay $24.99.
[5200.72 → 5201.46] Are you kidding me?
[5201.54 → 5201.76] No.
[5202.36 → 5204.62] So there you go.
[5205.04 → 5206.42] I was reformed.
[5206.82 → 5207.70] I think other people
[5207.70 → 5208.90] can be reformed by
[5208.90 → 5210.14] systems that are
[5210.14 → 5211.22] designed to actually
[5211.22 → 5212.52] work and not be so
[5212.52 → 5213.42] offensive to the
[5213.42 → 5213.74] consumer.
[5213.94 → 5214.22] That's like Valve's
[5214.22 → 5214.94] whole idea.
[5215.30 → 5215.50] Yep.
[5215.50 → 5216.38] To a certain degree.
[5216.40 → 5217.04] That's another thing
[5217.04 → 5217.26] too.
[5217.52 → 5218.62] Steam turned me
[5218.62 → 5220.26] into a legit game
[5220.26 → 5220.66] owner.
[5221.72 → 5222.56] Just like that.
[5224.32 → 5225.28] That's all they had
[5225.28 → 5226.20] to do was they had
[5226.20 → 5227.02] to let me use the
[5227.02 → 5227.84] games the way that I
[5227.84 → 5228.64] wanted to use them.
[5228.96 → 5229.82] Copy them back and
[5229.82 → 5230.60] forth rather than
[5230.60 → 5231.52] re-downloading them.
[5231.74 → 5232.40] Not have to worry
[5232.40 → 5233.24] about serials.
[5233.38 → 5233.96] Not having to worry
[5233.96 → 5235.50] about CD keys and
[5235.50 → 5236.30] physical media.
[5236.32 → 5236.94] It's like Excel
[5236.94 → 5238.00] databases that you
[5238.00 → 5238.82] used to hold because
[5238.82 → 5239.58] you'd lose them all
[5239.58 → 5239.92] the time.
[5239.94 → 5240.46] Like for me.
[5240.52 → 5240.90] I'm not saying
[5240.90 → 5241.36] about that.
[5241.44 → 5242.26] I think you did
[5242.26 → 5242.90] that but like I
[5242.90 → 5243.48] know a lot of
[5243.48 → 5243.66] people.
[5243.74 → 5244.94] I could make the
[5244.94 → 5245.42] argument.
[5245.76 → 5246.42] Like I could actually
[5246.42 → 5247.10] make the argument
[5247.10 → 5248.52] that I would pay
[5248.52 → 5250.10] $20 for the
[5250.10 → 5251.74] convenience of
[5251.74 → 5252.14] Steam.
[5252.46 → 5253.28] Never mind paying
[5253.28 → 5254.98] $20 for the
[5254.98 → 5255.86] actual content of
[5255.86 → 5256.32] the game.
[5256.52 → 5257.02] I mean if you're
[5257.02 → 5257.34] going to give me
[5257.34 → 5258.08] the content of the
[5258.08 → 5258.64] game and the
[5258.64 → 5259.16] convenience of
[5259.16 → 5260.14] Steam for $20 or
[5260.14 → 5260.98] an average of
[5260.98 → 5262.26] $24 for a
[5262.26 → 5262.72] AAA game.
[5262.72 → 5263.66] If like Play and
[5263.66 → 5264.44] Origin and Steam
[5264.44 → 5265.18] didn't exist and
[5265.18 → 5265.86] there was a service
[5265.86 → 5266.38] that just like
[5266.38 → 5267.06] managed all your
[5267.06 → 5267.72] CD keys and
[5267.72 → 5268.30] managed all the
[5268.30 → 5268.92] downloads and
[5268.92 → 5269.40] managed all the
[5269.40 → 5270.10] installs and all
[5270.10 → 5270.56] that kind of stuff
[5270.56 → 5271.06] and made it so you
[5271.06 → 5271.54] could drag and
[5271.54 → 5272.30] drop whole folders
[5272.30 → 5272.82] for games.
[5272.92 → 5273.52] And it was like a
[5273.52 → 5274.24] pirate service.
[5274.24 → 5275.94] Honestly, I'll be
[5275.94 → 5276.78] completely honest with
[5276.78 → 5277.14] you guys.
[5277.26 → 5278.26] I would probably use
[5278.26 → 5279.18] that service for at
[5279.18 → 5279.92] least some stuff
[5279.92 → 5281.46] because for me it
[5281.46 → 5283.22] really is about the
[5283.22 → 5284.74] appropriate content
[5284.74 → 5285.60] delivery model.
[5286.82 → 5287.84] So there you go.
[5288.42 → 5289.10] That's why pirates
[5289.10 → 5289.50] thrive.
[5289.78 → 5290.28] Content delivery
[5290.28 → 5290.92] models suck.
[5291.36 → 5291.94] That's why Netflix
[5291.94 → 5292.84] is doing so well
[5292.84 → 5294.24] because previous movie
[5294.24 → 5295.22] content delivery models
[5295.22 → 5296.06] were terrible.
[5296.28 → 5297.08] And honestly I've
[5297.08 → 5298.22] had no time to
[5298.22 → 5299.24] watch movies or TV
[5299.24 → 5300.42] shows lately with
[5300.42 → 5301.48] the kids and all
[5301.48 → 5301.68] that.
[5301.88 → 5304.36] But if I like
[5304.36 → 5305.96] once things settle
[5305.96 → 5306.70] in a little bit
[5306.70 → 5307.54] then I'll probably
[5307.54 → 5308.38] reactivate my
[5308.38 → 5309.06] Netflix subscription
[5309.06 → 5309.48] as well.
[5310.20 → 5311.00] I have it.
[5311.08 → 5311.42] I don't even
[5311.42 → 5312.14] necessarily use it
[5312.14 → 5312.76] that much but
[5312.76 → 5313.48] there will be like
[5313.48 → 5314.36] that weekend where
[5314.36 → 5314.94] I have nothing to
[5314.94 → 5315.84] do, or I have
[5315.84 → 5316.60] something to do but
[5316.60 → 5317.32] it's like in my
[5317.32 → 5317.96] house, and I'll just
[5317.96 → 5318.54] play something in
[5318.54 → 5319.74] the background and
[5319.74 → 5320.64] I'm like oh yeah I'm
[5320.64 → 5321.38] happy I have this.
[5322.22 → 5322.82] And I'll get like
[5322.82 → 5324.26] the whole value of
[5324.26 → 5325.34] that monthly sub from
[5325.34 → 5325.96] like a day.
[5326.30 → 5326.44] Yep.
[5326.54 → 5327.54] Be like yep awesome
[5327.54 → 5328.48] super happy I had
[5328.48 → 5328.68] this.
[5329.18 → 5330.52] So I think that's
[5330.52 → 5331.42] pretty much it.
[5331.48 → 5334.10] I'm okay with it
[5334.10 → 5334.64] being pretty much
[5334.64 → 5335.10] it because I'm
[5335.10 → 5335.98] super overheating
[5335.98 → 5336.62] because I'm wearing
[5336.62 → 5337.32] a shirt and then
[5337.32 → 5338.04] another shirt and
[5338.04 → 5338.78] then a sweater and
[5338.78 → 5339.08] a wig.
[5339.38 → 5340.30] Do I have a sweater
[5340.30 → 5341.16] on under my habit?
[5341.38 → 5341.88] No I don't.
[5342.50 → 5343.20] I'm sure there's
[5343.20 → 5343.76] going to be a fair
[5343.76 → 5344.42] number of people
[5344.42 → 5345.08] talking because I've
[5345.08 → 5345.88] actually never really
[5345.88 → 5346.70] talked about that I
[5346.70 → 5347.60] used to pirate a lot
[5347.60 → 5348.08] of content.
[5348.52 → 5349.26] Yeah I think that's
[5349.26 → 5349.74] the first time you
[5349.74 → 5350.12] ever brought that up.
[5350.12 → 5351.38] I speak out a lot
[5351.38 → 5353.00] against piracy and
[5353.00 → 5355.66] like I dismiss a lot
[5355.66 → 5356.70] of those arguments and
[5356.70 → 5357.68] the reason that I feel
[5357.68 → 5358.98] like I have the right
[5358.98 → 5360.14] to do that is because
[5360.14 → 5361.00] I have made those
[5361.00 → 5362.20] arguments and I
[5362.20 → 5363.32] know that I was
[5363.32 → 5364.30] just lying to myself.
[5364.58 → 5365.66] I was lying to myself
[5365.66 → 5366.42] and I was lying to
[5366.42 → 5367.52] other people, and it's
[5367.52 → 5368.52] basically complete
[5368.52 → 5369.00] rubbish.
[5369.20 → 5369.86] I've gone back.
[5369.86 → 5370.52] It's horse crap.
[5371.18 → 5372.28] And like I know it's
[5372.28 → 5373.40] not the same because
[5373.40 → 5374.34] right when your game
[5374.34 → 5375.34] launches the metrics
[5375.34 → 5377.08] are massively more
[5377.08 → 5377.78] important and whatnot
[5377.78 → 5379.20] but certain things that
[5379.20 → 5380.16] I pirated when I was a
[5380.16 → 5381.06] kid and there was
[5381.06 → 5382.28] legitimately no possible
[5382.28 → 5383.02] way I could have paid
[5383.02 → 5385.02] for it, I have gone
[5385.02 → 5386.80] back and purchased in
[5386.80 → 5387.70] like almost every
[5387.70 → 5388.10] scenario.
[5388.10 → 5390.78] So people are saying
[5390.78 → 5391.46] I'm going to lose my
[5391.46 → 5391.88] sponsors.
[5392.20 → 5393.58] I've said far worse on
[5393.58 → 5394.08] this show.
[5396.08 → 5397.88] So yeah good luck with
[5397.88 → 5398.24] that.
[5399.04 → 5400.22] Thanks for watching guys
[5400.22 → 5401.56] we'll see you again next
[5401.56 → 5402.96] week same bat time same
[5402.96 → 5403.64] bat channel.
[5403.80 → 5404.46] We won't be girls.
[5404.68 → 5406.02] We will not be we will
[5406.02 → 5407.76] not be dressed up as
[5407.76 → 5409.60] nuns and the chick from
[5409.60 → 5410.08] Firefly.
[5410.20 → 5411.00] What's with this shirt?
[5411.56 → 5412.88] She wears this is not a
[5412.88 → 5413.94] very accurate representation
[5413.94 → 5416.04] but it's probably just
[5416.04 → 5416.98] like the best thing that
[5416.98 → 5418.58] could find, but she wears
[5418.58 → 5419.96] like her her kind of
[5419.96 → 5420.90] greasy overalls and
[5420.90 → 5421.86] then she wears like a
[5421.86 → 5423.12] more girly shirt under
[5423.12 → 5423.30] it.
[5423.42 → 5425.62] Usually it's less terrible
[5425.62 → 5426.14] than this.
[5426.36 → 5426.72] All right.
[5427.02 → 5427.56] Peace guys.
[5427.64 → 5428.30] She also doesn't have a
[5428.30 → 5428.54] beard.
[5429.74 → 5431.02] So how can you tell?
[5433.64 → 5435.28] She could have a like
[5435.28 → 5436.92] transparent hair beard.
[5436.92 → 5440.96] You don't think so but I
[5440.96 → 5441.86] asked how you know I
[5441.86 → 5442.80] didn't ask how you don't
[5442.80 → 5443.28] think so.
[5443.72 → 5444.34] But if you had a
[5444.34 → 5444.56] turn.
[5446.56 → 5447.46] Doesn't everyone have
[5447.46 → 5447.70] like a.
[5447.74 → 5448.84] Have you ever rubbed
[5448.84 → 5450.10] your face against hers?
[5450.56 → 5450.96] No.
[5451.26 → 5451.72] But I would.
[5452.56 → 5453.86] Would you do that if
[5453.86 → 5454.64] you had the opportunity?
[5455.12 → 5455.56] Probably.
[5456.24 → 5457.44] Although not forcibly.
[5457.76 → 5458.40] She would have to be
[5458.40 → 5459.14] okay with it first.
[5459.42 → 5459.68] Okay.
[5459.78 → 5460.70] I would be okay with you
[5460.70 → 5461.48] rubbing your face against
[5461.48 → 5461.76] mine.
[5462.02 → 5462.46] Would you?
[5462.82 → 5463.78] Probably not, actually.
[5463.86 → 5464.90] I was just I wanted to
[5464.90 → 5465.40] clarify that.
[5465.40 → 5466.54] Based on how much residue
[5466.54 → 5468.06] your hands leave on mice.
[5468.26 → 5469.10] I don't think I need to
[5469.10 → 5469.92] make contact with your
[5469.92 → 5470.12] face.
[5470.12 → 5470.92] My face doesn't sweat
[5470.92 → 5472.22] as much as my hands do.
[5472.54 → 5473.36] Can you prove that
[5473.36 → 5474.08] without rubbing your
[5474.08 → 5474.64] face on me?
[5475.16 → 5476.54] Actually probably yeah.
