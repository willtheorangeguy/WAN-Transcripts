[0.00 → 13.86] oh we have no branding come back branding where are you okay there's one of them hold on
[13.86 → 22.30] bring all the things back all right welcome to the WAN show the weekly show where you listen to us
[22.30 → 27.04] talk for anywhere from I think the shortest show we've ever done is about an hour and a quarter
[27.04 → 33.34] and the longest ones we've done are like reaching up around three hours yeah we've we've done some
[33.34 → 38.38] I have to go at six you have to go at six yeah what do you think this is some kind of company
[38.38 → 43.16] where like work ends at six I think this is the first time that I've even said that in like a
[43.16 → 49.04] really long time why are you still wearing that yeah I'm wearing my lav mic because I uh yeah
[49.04 → 53.24] because I'm wearing my lav mic I'm going to take my lav mic off you know what I wonder if that would
[53.24 → 57.50] just be the solution I should yell at Brandon to bring me the other thing and if we
[57.50 → 62.90] just each wore lavs I wonder if that would just be better anyway guys we've got a great show for you
[62.90 → 71.78] today as always this week the big topics are the Game works controversy Nvidia and AMD are at it again
[71.78 → 78.62] and surprising super butt hurt at each other again surprising we're really surprised oh yeah here
[78.62 → 84.16] you're a little far over that way Cochin we never uh we never can quite get the whole where
[84.16 → 90.52] we should put like x's on the chair so that we know like where it aligns with kind of the butthole
[90.52 → 98.36] so that you can be in exactly the right spot every week uh yeah that would work yeah I mean if we
[98.36 → 103.04] didn't want to go for the whole butthole thing then we could just put like butt marks around the
[103.04 → 107.92] outside where the cheeks go but then if one of us put on some weight then we wouldn't be able to see
[107.92 → 115.56] them anyway not that that's happened to either of us lately we switched I wouldn't, we switched I
[115.56 → 122.84] know oh my goodness we did too yeah you'll get it back I don't really want to talk about it all
[122.84 → 129.26] right, so there's the AMD thing there's an SSD middleware that could be coming that could they're
[129.26 → 136.56] claiming quadruple your SSDs performance and this is without actually buying a new SSD, although I'd be
[136.56 → 142.48] surprised to see something like that implemented for free what else we got oh I have to jump back up
[142.48 → 146.06] there uh Google is gonna start building their own self-driving cars they've had this kind of stuff
[146.06 → 149.60] going on for a while, but they're actually gonna start manufacturing these cars which is really
[149.60 → 155.42] interesting and true crypt may or may not be compromised I'll talk about that more later may not
[155.42 → 162.12] yeah there's new stuff that I found recently oh even more new stuff okay this is an ever-changing topic
[162.12 → 172.24] so
[172.24 → 196.86] so our sponsors of the show today are Asus with the excellent g750 jay-z gaming notebook
[196.86 → 206.28] and of course modes who are running their geek stakes 2014 Facebook sweepstakes where you and
[206.28 → 213.16] anyone you know who's interested in getting a job as an in it industry can go and head over to
[213.16 → 218.38] facebook.com slash modes to get more details on how you can win a bunch of really cool stuff it's
[218.38 → 222.60] been running all week, and actually we've been getting a lot of pretty darn positive feedback
[222.60 → 230.58] about it so stay tuned for us to explain more about that later after we actually do a show here so
[230.58 → 238.74] first order of business you know what why don't we just straight up jump into the NVIDIA AMD thing i
[238.74 → 244.06] think that's uh that's a pretty nice topic to give to the people who were sitting there waiting for
[244.06 → 249.44] us to start the show you guys are awesome thank you for being on time even though we rarely are
[249.44 → 253.74] were we on time today ish like one minute late yeah I think we're like one minute late
[253.74 → 260.82] and we pre-streamed a little bit before but like my laptop still isn't plugged in so if screen sharing
[260.82 → 266.18] doesn't work the way that it normally should, we need that checklist we're yeah we're we're going to be in a
[266.18 → 275.40] little bit of trouble here, so yeah all right okay, so this was posted originally by booker Dewitt
[275.40 → 283.56] on the forum, and it is an article from forbs about why watchdogs is bad news for AMD users and
[283.56 → 292.72] potentially the entire pc gaming ecosystem, so this isn't exactly a new thing for AMD to wave the flag
[292.72 → 299.42] about and what they're basically saying is that game works represents a clear and present threat to
[299.42 → 305.38] gamers by deliberately crippling performance on AMD products now what game works effectively
[305.40 → 311.72] is it's an um it's an it's a toolkit that game developers can use to implement features
[311.72 → 318.84] or um basically features or graphical um well really features features
[318.84 → 324.80] features implement features into their games without actually coding the whole thing
[324.80 → 331.70] themselves so when I was at NVIDIA's um Montreal event they were showing off some of the big improvements
[331.70 → 338.82] that they had made recently to game works with things like particles and fire where to put it
[338.82 → 346.50] sort of in really, really simple terms it's kind of like on a camera having a profile that makes the image
[346.50 → 352.18] look better or adds an effect to your image where the game developer doesn't actually have to dial in
[352.18 → 356.10] all the manual settings and figure out how to do themselves so it's basically like think of it like
[356.10 → 362.34] dragging and dropping fire effects into your game so that it looks like this great realistic fire
[363.06 → 369.70] when all you had to do yourself was like put it there, and then it animates itself so that's what
[369.70 → 377.94] game works is but what AMD doesn't like about it is that developers license these proprietary NVIDIA
[377.94 → 384.82] technologies in order to make their games look great, but that doesn't give AMD any kind of real
[384.82 → 391.46] insight or necessarily a way to optimize their driver to perform well when rendering that feature
[391.46 → 397.46] in that game, so things like smoke and lighting and textures and shadows and all that kind of stuff
[397.46 → 406.18] can hurt performance on AMD cards says Robert Hallie, so participation often okay so okay this is from the
[406.18 → 411.38] original article so participation in the game works program often precludes the developer from accepting
[411.38 → 416.50] AMD suggestions that would improve performance directly in the game code the most desirable form
[416.50 → 423.30] of optimization so basically he's also saying that this makes it more difficult for them to perform
[423.30 → 431.06] their own after the fact driver optimizations, and it's basically yeah you know AMD doesn't support or
[431.06 → 439.38] condone such activities, and it's like super poppy and terrible now a couple of days went by and NVIDIA fired
[439.38 → 445.78] back and basically I'm a little surprised at how long it took but I can understand why they would
[445.78 → 450.82] have wanted to be very careful about their response they don't want to say anything that's that's not
[450.82 → 455.94] correct so NVIDIA came back and said look we'll have a have a kickoff meeting with the developers
[455.94 → 461.54] we'll brainstorm cool new effects we'll show them the catalogues that we have, and then we'll prototype
[461.54 → 465.54] something outside their engine give them an idea what the effect might look like, and we work with the
[465.54 → 472.58] developers, but we don't and never have restricted anyone from getting access as part of our agreements
[472.58 → 477.14] not with watchdogs and not with other titles our agreements focus on interesting things we're going
[477.14 → 482.82] to do together to improve the experience for all pc gamers and of course for NVIDIA customers we don't
[482.82 → 488.10] have anything in there restricting anyone from accessing source code or binaries and developers are free
[488.10 → 499.38] to give builds out to whoever they want it's their product so pretty much where we're at right now
[499.38 → 506.42] is he says she says which is the usual thing with AMD and NVIDIA um I don't think I don't think
[506.42 → 511.22] we're likely to get any kind of official response from any game developer because the last thing they're
[511.22 → 517.94] going to want to do is jeopardize yeah their relationship remember game developers need both AMD and NVIDIA on
[517.94 → 525.70] board ultimately even uh the way it's meant to be played title the dev wants it to run on AMD cards
[525.70 → 531.54] they're not going to ignore 40 of the market or 30 however odd percent of the market by just making it
[531.54 → 536.58] run like poo on AMD cards if they don't have to there 's's some speculation about the whole source
[536.58 → 541.54] code thing because they could be like yeah you can release the source code, but our parts are obfuscated so
[541.54 → 547.38] you can't actually read that part of the source code so you can get to some of it but then whenever one of
[547.38 → 552.26] the game works effects is going to go off you're really not going to know what's happening there
[552.26 → 557.54] so it's its it's it comes down to wording and what's actually being said so let's talk a little
[557.54 → 565.06] bit about what you'd rather see I mean AMD did their whole mantle thing which I don't think they've
[565.06 → 571.38] actually opened it up to NVIDIA yet even though they said that they would at some point where basically
[571.38 → 578.34] the game would have to be coded completely differently to run um on DirectX versus on mantle
[578.34 → 584.90] whereas what NVIDIA is doing is they're approaching developers and going okay here's a feature it'll run
[584.90 → 592.34] on whatever, but the performance is obviously you know built for our hardware we're optimizing for
[592.34 → 598.34] NVIDIA um and the positive and negative things here are both pretty clear to me so positive number one
[598.34 → 603.94] is that we're getting much better visual effects than we otherwise would have been able to or much
[603.94 → 612.02] less work required for very small devs to create visually stunning games that will run on AMD
[612.02 → 618.18] but won't necessarily perform the best and then the disadvantage is that it creates this segmentation
[618.18 → 624.98] where NVIDIA is kind of helping developers make games that run better on NVIDIA hardware
[628.34 → 633.62] and potentially depending on who you believe make it more difficult to run on AMD hardware or at least
[633.62 → 639.22] more difficult to optimize yeah I don't know if I'd say more difficult to run so if you had your way
[640.58 → 647.38] would you say i developer x I would like you to use game works or I wouldn't like you to use game works
[648.34 → 653.86] and let's say let's say I let's give you guys two you know what let's get struggle it so I want
[653.86 → 660.82] two options I want to triple a developer and then I want indie developer so allow multiple poll choices
[660.82 → 668.34] so AA developer yes AAA developer no Indy yes Indy no would you like for them to use it or would you
[668.34 → 673.62] like for them to not if they can save some dev costs if they can bring it to you earlier if they can
[673.62 → 680.82] spend that time on developing gameplay more as opposed to animating better fire or something like that
[680.82 → 688.82] how do you guys feel about it because I mean for to me game works is a very natural evolution of what
[688.82 → 698.02] already existed as gaming evolved the way it's meant to be played these programs where NVIDIA and AMD
[698.02 → 704.18] and often both of them at the same time are working very closely with game developers in order to optimize
[704.18 → 710.18] the game to me this is just NVIDIA taking a very proactive approach to that so instead of a game developer
[710.18 → 714.34] building something bringing it to NVIDIA and them going okay let's optimize it they're giving them
[714.34 → 722.58] something that's optimized in the first place it doesn't feel wrong to me, but it does put AMD at
[722.58 → 728.82] a disadvantage, but that's just AMD or that's just NVIDIA working very closely with developers and
[728.82 → 734.50] proactively helping developers make better games even though they could go out of their way
[734.50 → 741.86] and let the source code be leaked to AMD if you were NVIDIA would you do that see, but they built the
[741.86 → 745.94] technology yeah you've got you've got multiple arguments for that as well, but then you can turn
[745.94 → 751.86] around and go AMD built trust effects and allows anyone to use it in all one game that it's being
[751.86 → 759.14] used in whereas NVIDIA has created I mean that's something that I got to look at too and I go okay AMD or
[759.14 → 764.34] NVIDIA can say here's what we're giving to developers but at the end of the day whether developers
[764.34 → 768.90] are using them to me even though I'm not a game dev and I don't really understand how these tools work
[768.90 → 773.38] very intimately I look at it and I go well this is the one the developers are actually using
[775.46 → 781.14] how useful was the other stuff that they're not using I don't know yeah I don't know personally I don't
[781.14 → 785.30] think I'm as against games works as a lot of people are and that's that's another thing too like
[785.30 → 791.14] if you look back at the forbs article they have a picture for uh 290x versus 770
[794.50 → 801.46] if you see that oh uh can you send me the link it's in the doc it's in the doc oh that makes sense
[801.46 → 806.90] okay right there we go all right so guys here's the image that Luke is referring to and
[806.90 → 810.90] then if you go to I wonder if I can find it on the network I should be able to find it on the network
[810.90 → 816.74] I should have looked for this earlier but my charts I seriously don't think it was that bad
[816.74 → 823.54] like the gap differences for tier equivalents right were really not that far away especially
[823.54 → 830.66] considering like how scared so many people were at the very beginning and considering that we run stock
[830.66 → 835.86] coolers on everything yeah so the current NVIDIA stock coolers are making colder cards than the current
[835.86 → 841.62] AMD ones are which are running really hot so a lot of our overclocking and NVIDIA benefit from a cooler
[841.62 → 846.42] running card yeah exactly so some of our overclocks are getting higher on NVIDIA right now just because
[846.42 → 852.98] we have more overclocking headroom due to thermals if we we we do stock cards so next generation might
[852.98 → 861.38] flip-flop reference cards yeah sorry um so like it's not like that changed and the AMD
[861.38 → 866.26] cards are still really close so I don't know I don't see it being this horrible thing that everyone's
[866.26 → 870.10] talking about like maybe it was harder for AMD to do it I know they're talking about how they're not
[870.10 → 875.86] going to be able to fix it as much afterwards with drivers as they could have before um it's in the
[875.86 → 880.82] actual folder for the actual thing yeah it's okay I mean ultimately the thing here though is that
[880.82 → 887.70] both AMD and NVIDIA did manage to have optimized drivers available for the game's public release
[887.70 → 897.06] and then for all the good it did anyone because watchdogs is well yeah a bit of a dog right now in
[897.06 → 903.86] the forbs article that he's showing 290x and 770 being very competitive in mine here I've got it now
[903.86 → 913.06] here we go there so guys have a look at this so we've got 780 and 290x being within 10 of each other
[913.06 → 919.70] and then 290 trailing another couple of percent after that with 770 getting absolutely destroyed
[919.70 → 926.50] and like everyone calls us NVIDIA fanboys and like what the forbs article showed them with the
[926.50 → 932.34] 770 winning, and they're like AMD was crushed in this blah blah like no they did totally fine
[933.14 → 939.94] it wasn't even that bad for how much they were suppressed and stuff yeah like I don't actually see
[939.94 → 944.50] it was being that big of a deal maybe the run that I had didn't have a crazy amount of game works
[945.06 → 952.18] effects I don't like I don't know I really don't think I wonder what forbes.com knows about game
[952.18 → 958.90] benchmarking anyway no and I'm not even I'm not even I actually didn't read the article so straight up
[958.90 → 963.22] I didn't read the article maybe you guys can tell me maybe they have a fantastic benchmarking methodology
[963.22 → 968.90] I'll be the first to admit ours isn't the best either but i I like i just I wonder how they're actually
[968.90 → 975.14] benchmarking the game yeah uh because it just has nothing to do with the results that we're getting
[975.14 → 982.18] so and i to my knowledge they haven't done a ton of video card reviews like I saw a r9 295 x21 because
[982.18 → 987.22] I was getting a lot of tweets back when that card was released going hey Linus why did you not get a
[987.22 → 993.22] sample of this card and forbes.com did and I was kind of like I don't know um because forbs isn't
[993.22 → 998.74] really known they're more known for market analysis and less known for actually taking physical
[998.74 → 1004.66] hardware and reviewing it so it just seemed like a bit of a bit of a weird thing to me yeah so there
[1004.66 → 1011.30] you have its guys um that's the current state of affairs we'll update you guys if anything happens but
[1011.30 → 1017.78] I personally see this as a bit of a non-issue for the moment especially because the differences in
[1017.78 → 1022.98] performance really don't look very different from other games whether they are a way it's meant to be
[1022.98 → 1030.18] played or a gaming evolved title in fact I haven't seen obvious optimization to the point where it's
[1030.18 → 1038.98] like yes this game is clearly handicapped in a really long time yeah all right so moving on to
[1038.98 → 1046.58] our next topic speaking of watchdogs this was an article from the register but uh they're not the
[1046.58 → 1055.54] only ones reporting on this ten of thousands of watchdogs pirates enslaved by bitcoin bot master i
[1055.54 → 1064.34] think that's a very sensationalist headline, but it doesn't change anything about the fact that pirating
[1064.34 → 1072.18] games is just plain not a very good idea sometimes so basically what was happening is your machine you
[1072.18 → 1077.22] would install the game and run it and your machine would launch another executable that would start
[1077.22 → 1085.78] to mine bitcoins for the right now it's not very clear whether it was the original cracker of the
[1085.78 → 1090.10] game or whether it was someone who took a cracked release that they claim they never did maybe you
[1090.10 → 1094.66] have some on the watchdogs video people were saying that I was wrong because I said the guy
[1094.66 → 1100.34] that cracked it put in the thing but then other places where I've looked up are saying that the guy that
[1100.34 → 1108.02] cracked it just faked skid row's name skid row is a very popular well-known game cracker um so I don't
[1108.02 → 1114.10] know what actually happened but something happened and one that a lot of people downloaded had a minor in
[1114.10 → 1119.86] it so the great thing about this is particularly on lower end machines that was having a dramatic
[1119.86 → 1125.62] impact on the game's performance which might be where some of the oh watchdogs runs terribly stuff
[1125.62 → 1131.86] was coming from although from what we've seen it really doesn't look better than something like
[1131.86 → 1136.42] Far Cry 3. unless the official version also has a minor in it, I don't just I'm kidding
[1137.78 → 1144.34] one thing that I thought was pretty funny that's interesting what a free game that instead of being
[1144.34 → 1149.14] you can choose you can go okay I'll pay for the game or I'll mine for you or I'll mine for you
[1149.14 → 1155.30] that's interesting anyway um moving along one thing I want to bring up one another one of the
[1155.30 → 1159.94] comments on the video I should have quoted this somewhere, but the guy was saying um it's its
[1159.94 → 1164.42] funny because the pirated version didn't get a three-hour mission which was defeating you play to be
[1164.42 → 1168.10] able to play the game yeah I know right that was hilarious I don't know he might have said it in some
[1168.10 → 1174.42] other way but yeah it's so true trying to benchmark it was really difficult because logging into you play
[1174.42 → 1178.98] was such a challenge half the time would just be like you don't have an internet connection I'm like
[1178.98 → 1184.18] actually yeah I do would really like if you just worked now, and you have to sit there clicking try
[1184.18 → 1190.18] again for like forever so the way that it worked is it would launch this miner and then once you close
[1190.18 → 1198.58] down the game that would actually continue to run so whoever did this is like pretty freaking oh yeah
[1198.58 → 1204.50] happy right now yeah and then there's a bunch of pretty upset people about the uh about well the fact
[1204.50 → 1208.90] that they just generated a bunch of bitcoins for some butthead you part of the game
[1208.90 → 1215.38] so I can't feel that bad one of the conspiracy theories running around was that Ubisoft did it
[1217.86 → 1222.58] I don't think they're that in need of money, but that would be that would be pretty funny leaking your
[1222.58 → 1227.94] own pirated game but just putting a like a bitcoin miner in it so it's like yeah you don't want to
[1227.94 → 1235.62] pay for the game guess what dog that would actually be hilarious or if it was like some guy at Ubisoft
[1236.18 → 1243.62] that did it with that intention fantastic all right let's move on to our oh we never got the straw poll
[1243.62 → 1249.62] results did I get a link for that I posted in chat a billion times um I don't think I have the link so
[1249.62 → 1257.62] I do okay i i I'm afraid of what's going to happen if we do this but if i just no, no no just go to chat
[1257.62 → 1261.94] go to chat okay I'm going to chat I'm going to chat I got this I got this okay guys so let's have a look
[1261.94 → 1269.78] at the straw poll results I don't remember what I asked ah yes should they use game works and wow
[1271.06 → 1277.46] so the majority of you made it a multi-vote poll right yeah well I don't think too many people voted for
[1277.46 → 1282.10] more than one result I think that adds up to about 100 but anyway the majority of you are just saying
[1282.10 → 1288.82] yes you and especially indie devs you'd like to see indie devs be able to take advantage of this
[1288.82 → 1295.62] deliver a game I mean that runs on AMD hardware based on the amount of votes there so okay it doesn't
[1295.62 → 1302.42] matter yeah so that might look better than if I don't remember what I'm talking right that might
[1302.42 → 1307.14] look better than if they had to code all this stuff themselves as long as it runs on AMD then you're
[1307.14 → 1312.58] still totally cool with them optimizing it using NVIDIA's tools so I mean I think that's great
[1312.58 → 1317.62] because there's been a lot of a lot of back and forth about this with some people declaring game
[1317.62 → 1322.50] works to be the worst thing ever and others you know kind of trumpeting the NVIDIA horn and I don't
[1322.50 → 1328.34] think either is the right answer it's somewhere in between as it usually is whenever fanboys get
[1328.34 → 1334.02] involved in some kind of argument yeah I don't know i just don't like i when I was
[1334.02 → 1338.10] reading through all this kind of stuff I was expecting the worst thing ever me too and then
[1338.10 → 1344.34] it was just really not that bad i was expecting half of watchdogs to basically be
[1344.34 → 1351.54] running off of like NVIDIA grid at their headquarters and Ubisoft didn't even know what was inside the
[1351.54 → 1356.82] black box, but it's not that at all wasn't it bios hock where if you had an AMD card you couldn't see
[1356.82 → 1360.98] certain effects in the game if you can see the water coming out of a pipe uh you're thinking of
[1360.98 → 1366.02] borderlands 2 borderlands 2 yeah sorry no like I was expecting something more along those lines
[1366.02 → 1373.22] yeah and that is still something that a bothers me and b I do think is terrible for the
[1373.22 → 1379.86] industry like the way that physics is implemented and will always be implemented as long as it's not
[1379.86 → 1386.58] something that AMD and NVIDIA users can leverage equally is just not that compelling to me once we can
[1386.58 → 1393.06] use physics technology across the board you could actually make a game that's designed to use it
[1393.06 → 1399.46] yeah and make that destructibility of the environment and all those other things that you can do through
[1399.46 → 1406.66] physics part of an integral part of gameplay I mean the last game we got that really used physics was
[1406.66 → 1415.78] like cell factor and that was a physics showcase piece yeah I'm still waiting and for that yeah and poppy
[1416.58 → 1424.18] not a very well received game at all I mean as much as it's great to walk around on the street and
[1424.18 → 1432.58] like kick cans out of your way it doesn't feel like a compelling gameplay element to me all right so
[1432.58 → 1438.82] the original poster on Linus tech tips.com was men for this one finally a super easy name to say yeah i
[1438.82 → 1446.74] know right I have so much difficulty with that men please post more JP research team develops SSD middleware
[1446.74 → 1453.94] that improves speed by 300 and the headlines don't seem to necessarily all agree about exactly how this
[1453.94 → 1459.94] works but basically what they're doing is instead of writing data to an on a new blank page data is written
[1459.94 → 1465.86] on a fragmented page located in the block to be erased next so it's kind of predictively because the way that
[1465.86 → 1472.90] SSDs work is you can't just overwrite something you have to blank it first which is actually the
[1472.90 → 1478.58] time-consuming part of writing something, but it gets more complicated than that you don't just you
[1478.58 → 1484.02] can't just blank something and then write over top of it because you might need to rearrange some of the
[1484.02 → 1488.82] stuff that's written within that cell and put it somewhere else but that gets more complicated than
[1488.82 → 1493.54] that because you don't even if you were to rewrite all this stuff all over the place blanket and then
[1493.54 → 1500.18] write to it, you don't want to unnecessarily blank pages if you don't have to because that significantly
[1500.18 → 1506.34] degrades the longevity of the SSD so the way that they work is really complicated what this is going
[1506.34 → 1512.26] to do is it's going to look for predictively which one is going to be blanked next and then try to
[1512.26 → 1518.74] proactively make room for your right so it might not affect read speeds that much, but it will affect
[1518.74 → 1523.06] reads in the context of that you won't have to wait around for writes, and it should affect write
[1523.06 → 1528.90] speeds dramatically, and they're also claiming that you could increase the product life up to I think
[1528.90 → 1534.98] they're saying around 55 percent not to mention you lower power consumption because you're not doing as
[1534.98 → 1544.02] much random shuffling around of data but wait there's more it looks like this could be as simple as a
[1544.02 → 1550.74] middleware layer that sits between the SSD and your operating system, and it does all or between your
[1550.74 → 1557.14] driver or between the controller sits in the middle it sits in the middle somewhere, and you might not
[1557.14 → 1563.46] even need a new SSD which is kind of awesome i I don't see a ton of different manufacturers implementing
[1563.46 → 1573.78] this for free yeah I'd imagine it's going to be more like uh now with turbocharge Uber danger I don't
[1573.78 → 1583.14] know whatever I don't danger could mean fast probably not no, no I'm thinking wow that car is totally danger
[1583.14 → 1589.86] oh god don't make that a thing um it was in a simulation so I'm not sure if we'll see exactly this
[1589.86 → 1594.58] much speed and power improvement all that kind of stuff in real life, but it's exciting to see someone
[1594.58 → 1602.42] improving SSDs in this way yeah yeah I mean SSD the thing about SSDs is look at how stagnant it's been
[1602.42 → 1610.66] yep in terms of flash speeds in terms of interface speeds and in terms of capacities it's not really
[1610.66 → 1617.46] moving very fast and everyone's kind of jumping on the whoa we need PCI Express, and we need SATA express
[1617.46 → 1625.70] well we needed it two years ago did we flash is not getting faster with each new generation flash
[1625.70 → 1630.74] is continuing to actually get slower and less reliable because of the smaller manufacturing
[1630.74 → 1635.70] processes, and it's not like, and we're not going to get a dramatic improvement there until we get
[1635.70 → 1641.38] a big shift in the way that flash is manufactured, so people are saying danger in chat raise your dangers
[1642.10 → 1647.30] okay guys you've got two minutes of raising dangers all you want, and then we need it to go away or
[1647.30 → 1654.02] we're going to start giving people times at timeouts um, but basically we need more we need smarter
[1654.02 → 1658.58] software we need smarter controllers in order to really get more out of our SSDs I think a great
[1658.58 → 1667.30] example is letters m6e which is not straight up not faster than a SATA SSD in real world tests yes you
[1667.30 → 1673.94] get better sequential reads and not necessarily even writes, but we're limited by other factors still so yeah
[1673.94 → 1678.50] yeah I don't know it'll be interesting to see what this does when it's actually in the hands of
[1678.50 → 1682.66] people instead of a simulation yeah because a lot of the time I love it how we're always getting these
[1682.66 → 1689.06] like new holographic disc enables 500 terabytes per disc, and then it turns out it's impossible to
[1689.06 → 1693.54] manufacture there's some other kind of show-stopping and like you can put data on it, but you can
[1693.54 → 1699.62] never read from if it's like oh yeah like you have to like to make it out of like you know ubiquitarian
[1699.62 → 1706.26] which contrary to the name is not ubiquitous I was just like, so everyone has this one
[1708.26 → 1713.62] uh that is a segue into skype translator because it's something that they're talking about which i
[1713.62 → 1719.78] really don't think is going to happen at least anytime soon it's like way down in rapid fire
[1719.78 → 1723.46] okay I'll find it I'll find it go ahead and keep there's not even really much I want to say about
[1723.46 → 1726.90] this they're they're trying to do something called skype translator which as far as I can tell is going to
[1726.90 → 1732.66] take what you say and translate it into some form of TTS or text to speak and then say it out of the
[1732.66 → 1736.58] other person's speakers or headphones whatever so you can talk to people over skype in different
[1736.58 → 1742.74] languages, and it's all translated and this was posted by raffia on the forum but like the open API for
[1742.74 → 1749.62] Microsoft translating stuff is terrible, and it's Microsoft so they'll probably work on it and then like
[1749.62 → 1755.06] it'll disappear or something and there's way more important things in my opinion that they need to fix
[1755.06 → 1760.98] with skype so hopefully they do that instead of making this um I don't know how many people are
[1760.98 → 1766.82] going to go for voice chat over skype that don't know how to speak a common language um, but it might
[1766.82 → 1774.66] be fun honestly when looking at this i see it more as being fun than anything else like maybe it'll
[1774.66 → 1781.46] help people learn different languages or something like that I don't know I mean i I see it being kind of
[1781.46 → 1785.78] niche like something like this like i actually I didn't know about this even though it's about a
[1785.78 → 1790.90] four-year-old app for iPhone at this point but word lens allows you to look at something in real
[1790.90 → 1795.62] time through your phone and have it actually translate on the fly um, and it's actually like
[1795.62 → 1802.10] it's pretty darn cool we were playing around with it a little bit today at NCI but by and large
[1802.98 → 1808.74] most people won't be using it I mean there's i I think that in the future we're going to see language
[1808.74 → 1815.38] barriers broken down this way but i just I don't think this is really if we're so far away that
[1815.38 → 1820.18] it's kind of it's not like oculus where it's like yeah we're like pumped about this because it's like
[1820.18 → 1828.42] happening soon it's like yeah my phone can barely tell what I'm saying to it now with like google voice
[1828.42 → 1834.02] yeah I don't think it's really gonna work when it's like going through different languages and then
[1834.02 → 1838.10] there's all the problems with converting language into another language and then having it still
[1838.10 → 1842.50] make any sense at all yep that's a huge issue especially when you bring in stuff like slang
[1842.50 → 1848.66] and other things which leads us pretty well into google starting to build their own self-driving
[1848.66 → 1854.66] cars I wish I could say I called this I did say I thought we were going to get an i car, but apple has
[1854.66 → 1860.42] instead gone it's funny you look at the reversal here where apple used to be all about building it
[1860.42 → 1867.62] themselves and google used to be all about partnering whereas now for phones I think that
[1867.62 → 1874.18] they have um been bitten a little bit on the whole partnering thing they've created a monster out of
[1874.18 → 1879.54] Samsung and kind of gone well hold on a second they would have been nowhere yeah without android
[1879.54 → 1885.62] without us, and you look at glass uh there I mean yes they're releasing the lightweight android
[1885.62 → 1890.58] that's going to run on wearables, and they will have partners but it just they've done most of
[1890.58 → 1895.70] the surrounding branding themselves with their own hardware before they're even talking about you know
[1895.70 → 1899.78] letting anyone else have access to any of this stuff you look at what they're doing with this car where
[1899.78 → 1904.58] they're going to build their own self-driving car you look at nexus program or whatever it's called
[1904.58 → 1909.62] silver now or whatever else it seems feels like they're moving in the direction of controlling the
[1909.62 → 1914.82] user experience and there is something to be said for that, but then apple on the other hand is going okay yeah
[1914.82 → 1919.46] we're going to partner with ford and Toyota and everyone to integrate our technology into the
[1919.46 → 1926.82] existing products, so this is it guys yeah it looks ridiculous, but that's not really the point it looks
[1926.82 → 1934.02] like a super unimpressed little like teddy bear yeah it's kind of look like a face doesn't it
[1936.18 → 1942.74] yeah and if you like a totally not happy face at all he's just like nope I'm doing things you
[1942.74 → 1947.70] enslaved me to drive around so I guess I can do that or whatever it is kind of slavery I guess
[1949.14 → 1958.10] so this was posted on the forum by Johannes and instead of even having a steering wheel or pedals
[1958.10 → 1962.26] which is something I personally am pretty uncomfortable with I'd like to have the option
[1962.26 → 1969.22] to manual override to manual override I mean this is like that um that doctor who episode where the
[1969.22 → 1976.02] i robot thing yeah it's well like anything where you know someone decides yeah we're going to drive you
[1976.02 → 1981.06] into the sea yeah and there's nothing you can do about it, i I would like to have a steering wheel and
[1981.06 → 1990.26] pedals but no it will have a stop and go button and that is pretty much it's very interesting self-driving
[1990.82 → 1996.26] um you know he can't, he can't be sad because the plastic doesn't go that far
[1996.26 → 2002.74] so maybe he is sad maybe it's like even worse than we expect because he can't pull the size of his
[2002.74 → 2008.66] mouth down anymore so he's showing the least amount of happiness as he can and Google is forcing that
[2008.66 → 2012.34] little car to be a minimum amount of happy would you miss driving
[2015.30 → 2016.34] mmm gross
[2018.34 → 2023.70] probably a little bit not really though because if I could do other stuff while I was in the car
[2023.70 → 2028.58] be a lot more productive a lot of people won't be able to anyway just because of motion sickness
[2030.18 → 2035.78] yeah I'd probably actually have a problem with it like I don't I i I used to get motion sick pretty
[2035.78 → 2040.74] hardcore but I just like I think I built up a tolerance to it or something mine seems to flip
[2040.74 → 2046.34] flop like one day it'll be a problem and I can't read my phone and then the other day it's totally fine
[2046.34 → 2051.70] and like it seems to depend on what car I'm in and who's driving and like there are tons of different
[2051.70 → 2056.90] variables so I have no idea it's funny how it's designed to make it seem non-threatening and help
[2056.90 → 2061.54] people accept self-driving technology but I just think it looks kind of ridiculous it does and like
[2061.54 → 2065.22] saying that that quote right there is like wow I'm now scared
[2068.90 → 2073.70] apparently earlier ones will have extra controls so test drivers can take over if there's a problem
[2073.70 → 2077.86] that sounds like the one that I would be interested in having yeah so it'll, it will be an electric vehicle
[2077.86 → 2084.02] it'll have a combination of lasers and radar to drive I mean I personally am really excited for
[2084.02 → 2089.46] self-driving technology I just am not a hundred percent sure how I feel about Google doing it at
[2089.46 → 2097.14] this point with how broke Google Maps has been for me lately it's just every little thing, and you know
[2097.14 → 2101.14] what I'm going to get feedback from people where they go it's great it's amazing it works for me perfectly
[2101.14 → 2106.10] every time I'm like yeah that's fine, but that doesn't change the fact that my experience hasn't been that
[2106.10 → 2110.90] positive lately and all the feedback about how take me home doesn't work and everyone's like yeah
[2110.90 → 2116.74] it do I demoed on the show last week you know what is straight up doesn't work for me sorry it
[2116.74 → 2122.34] it doesn't work for it's not consistent enough, and we're talking about my life and this and this is
[2122.34 → 2127.06] like uh people publicly complain about both these things, but there's far more people publicly
[2127.06 → 2130.90] complaining about Google Maps and I've been having tons of troubles with it lately I mean you were
[2130.90 → 2136.02] trying to find a Tim Hortons it shouldn't be hard to find a Tim Hortons in Canada and there were
[2136.02 → 2142.34] two that my mom was able to give us directions to that Google Maps was not giving him the nearest
[2142.34 → 2146.66] locations for and was telling him to go what like 20 minutes away or something pretty far away and
[2146.66 → 2151.86] there was one like down the street walking distance from where I'd parked so I'm sitting here going what
[2151.86 → 2158.82] are you guys doing we're talking finding the nearest branch of a chain of restaurants it's super popular
[2158.82 → 2164.90] in Canada chain of restaurants is functionality that worked two years ago and this one was in a mall and
[2164.90 → 2168.74] had been there for a very long time, and it didn't know and there was another one down the road that
[2168.74 → 2174.26] wasn't in a mall in case being in the mall was the problem this is technology that worked really well
[2174.26 → 2179.46] back when I first started using Google Maps I'm having a lot of trouble with it lately yeah so I don't
[2179.46 → 2185.38] know I'm still planning to have you switch to the iPhone for a little while just to try it out try Apple Maps
[2185.38 → 2190.66] because I was pretty impressed as long as it doesn't like to drive me into a lake like it used to then it'll probably
[2190.66 → 2200.02] be fine we can't forget about that speaking of apple has confirmed the acquisition of beats so
[2200.66 → 2208.10] that whole video that leaked where Dr. Dre was boasting about the world's first I think who was it i
[2208.10 → 2212.18] think it was someone else actually pointing at him and sort of boasting of him, but the point was
[2212.18 → 2222.26] the world's first rap billionaire um you know what good for him is all I really have to say it is
[2223.14 → 2231.78] inexplicable to me that beats headphones were ever a thing um, but it was reading the verge article here
[2231.78 → 2237.30] uh this was posted originally on the forum by best efforts of like every tech enthusiast ever Alex goes high
[2237.30 → 2246.26] uh this was I think it was 30 or something like that I can't, I can't find the number but based
[2246.26 → 2253.14] on some market research I think it was something like 30 percent of headphone buyers above a hundred
[2253.14 → 2260.26] dollars wanted an endorsement on it and I'm kind of sitting here going like I weep
[2260.26 → 2271.46] for all of this like I just don't know what to say any more there was uh wait they wanted an endorsement
[2272.10 → 2277.46] yeah they wanted to see an endorsement before they would be willing to spend big money on a pair of
[2277.46 → 2285.22] headphones so from a previous verge article allegedly a pair of 200 beats headphones was somewhere
[2285.22 → 2290.18] in the neighbourhood of 14 to produce I'm not sure if I quite believe that because that might be
[2290.18 → 2296.10] a bomb cost but bomb costs do not represent the amount of product development that goes into
[2296.10 → 2301.38] building something it doesn't account for r d it doesn't account for you know plastic moulding it
[2301.38 → 2308.42] doesn't account for any other prototyping processes it doesn't account for marketing where admittedly a
[2308.42 → 2315.38] big part of the beats experience is the marketing and celebrity endorsements um probably the biggest that
[2315.38 → 2321.30] is probably the biggest part of it, but the point is that even the r d it just straight up doesn't
[2321.30 → 2331.06] account for all of that um, but they're also they're also buying other things while they're buying this
[2331.06 → 2337.54] company like they're not just buying like beats yes there's more to it than the headphones I mean i
[2337.54 → 2342.82] think that the fact that the brands are so similar in that they're able to achieve better than
[2343.62 → 2349.70] industry margins on their products I think that's a key part of the acquisition all although one other
[2349.70 → 2356.02] thing that I'd like to see if it happens is apple's been willing to take less than beats margin on their
[2356.02 → 2363.62] products for the sake of building a truly high quality premium product and I would like to see if apple's
[2363.62 → 2371.46] willing to spend 44 dollars instead of 14 or even 80 dollars on a pair of beats headphones that they're
[2371.46 → 2377.62] willing to sell for 200 or 250 I would like to see what they can bring to that because guys and don't
[2377.62 → 2384.26] kid yourselves the companies that you love you know the Sennheiser and AGS and audio technical of
[2384.26 → 2390.26] the world they're making pretty good margin on headphones too so it's not like beats is doing
[2390.26 → 2396.66] something it doesn't cost 1500 to make a pair of hd800s yeah to be a hundred percent clear if you think
[2396.66 → 2402.42] it costs that much you're dumb yeah I'm sorry, but you're actually stupid there's no way it doesn't
[2402.42 → 2407.62] cost that much, but again there's the r d so I would like to see if apple could tone down the whole
[2407.62 → 2413.46] celebrity endorsement thing something they haven't done much with um with i much of anything since like
[2413.46 → 2418.74] the Bono days um so if they could tone that down a little bit spend a little bit more on the actual
[2418.74 → 2423.06] materials and r d I'd be interested to see what they can come up with, but they're acquiring more than that
[2423.06 → 2428.74] they're also getting their beat's streaming service which is something that apple hasn't
[2428.74 → 2433.78] been able to or willing to build for themselves and is becoming much more popular with services like
[2433.78 → 2440.18] Spotify taking the place of the more traditional it's funny to be calling dollar mp3 downloads from
[2440.18 → 2446.66] iTunes traditional it feels like not that long ago the iPod revolution was happening right yeah yeah
[2446.66 → 2452.82] yeah yeah one thing that's been really frustrating lately is like uh one group that I've been
[2452.82 → 2458.98] listening to a lot is uh man what is it jukebox oh man now I'm not going to be able to remember what
[2458.98 → 2462.82] it's called, but it's its this group on YouTube that makes music the only way to possibly buy their
[2462.82 → 2469.70] stuff is through iTunes like I don't want to install that terrible piece of crap right it's not
[2469.70 → 2475.54] monster cat is it no yeah okay I'm not sure I can't remember the name of it someone wants Linus
[2475.54 → 2481.86] tech audio headphones yeah I don't think so I'll be the first to I'll be the first to admit that i
[2481.86 → 2490.18] don't uh I don't know enough about headphones to make headphones so there you have it is happened i I'm
[2490.18 → 2494.10] super, super interested to see what happens this is apple's biggest acquisition to date
[2494.98 → 2502.66] and let's move on than shall we true crypt has been compromised or maybe hasn't been
[2502.66 → 2508.50] compromised it's its an interesting setup if you go to the link at the bottom of the true crypt article
[2508.50 → 2517.94] in the doc yeah so posted by ion bass on the forum here uh yeah that's that was a comment on the thread
[2517.94 → 2525.06] oh sorry, sorry um well I think I closed it now posted by Castro zombie sorry about that now if you go to the
[2525.06 → 2530.98] bottom link true crypt.ch this is a new movement that has come up since the whole true crypt thing
[2530.98 → 2539.14] happened and this website not only tracks um what's going on with true crypt right now it's the like
[2539.14 → 2543.54] safe thing which who knows if that's actually true or not but someone's saying that it's currently safe
[2543.54 → 2549.38] at this point in time um but that the source code is just being is just sitting there so how long it'll be
[2549.38 → 2555.70] safe for we don't know or if it is even actually safe right now we don't know um these guys are
[2555.70 → 2562.26] planning on trying to pick up the project it's not an um what do they call if it's not like a branch
[2562.26 → 2565.94] or anything like that they're taking part of the license agreement of true crypt which allows people
[2565.94 → 2571.78] to kind of mess with their um source code, and they're going to be making their own so anyone who had
[2571.78 → 2578.02] true crypt anyone who's using true crypt uh we're probably not screwed luckily this group has come
[2578.02 → 2582.26] together and hopefully good things will come from this they have a blog coming soon they have a forum
[2582.26 → 2588.18] coming soon and any information that you need about true crypt will probably be at true crypt.ch
[2590.26 → 2596.98] okay so who the heck knows what's really going on right now a little bit of what was going on um it
[2596.98 → 2602.42] seems like with the close of Windows XP and most things being built into operating systems the true
[2602.42 → 2610.10] crypt project has been kind of abandoned um true crypt wasn't it was kind of taken for granted
[2610.10 → 2617.54] for a really long time the fact that it even existed um, and it's been kept up to date by just this fairly
[2617.54 → 2624.26] small group of people for a very long time, and they're just kind of done that's about it, they're
[2624.26 → 2628.58] just yeah no it's been like 10 years or something I don't remember exactly how long it's been
[2628.58 → 2633.38] but they're done with it now there's uh Windows 8.1 is blocking it with their smart screen feature
[2633.94 → 2640.58] it's its where is it I think it's detecting it as malware yeah because it's it might be it might be
[2640.58 → 2647.54] now the latest version but then maybe it isn't we don't know yeah i one thing is I wouldn't go
[2647.54 → 2653.06] to true crypt's actual website to download it I would probably go to true crypt.ch as far as I've seen
[2653.06 → 2660.66] a lot of people talking right now true crypt.ch seems to be legit um and the true crypt.org website
[2660.66 → 2664.26] is a lot of people have been speculating it might have been broken into and things might have been
[2664.26 → 2669.94] injected and there might be problems going on I don't know as like seriously as far as I can tell
[2669.94 → 2675.06] there's new news coming out about this like every hour I check up on it, and we've been on the after
[2675.06 → 2679.46] we've been on the show for a little while now so maybe something even changed um but yeah if you're
[2679.46 → 2683.54] very interested in true crypt I would check out true crypt.ch and keep paying attention there
[2683.54 → 2688.58] hopefully they get their forms and their blog going soon so that people can have a hub to talk about
[2688.58 → 2696.74] it on and that should be good and that should be good I hope, so this is the conclusion i I really like
[2696.74 → 2702.34] true crypt and I use it a lot so I really hope that someone properly picks up this project and keeps
[2702.34 → 2708.42] it going and that all the like oh my god the NSA was running it and all this other crap stuff doesn't
[2708.42 → 2715.46] end up being true I don't know it probably is uh whatever what I'm hiding is really not that
[2715.46 → 2723.06] important so it's fine oh well I guess you can have my online banking information which you probably
[2723.06 → 2730.74] have anyway jerks I know right it's like the most disappointing thing ever everything feels futile at
[2730.74 → 2736.18] this point, but it isn't it's still worth it to keep trying to uh to keep trying to protect your rights and
[2736.18 → 2741.70] all that noise yeah speaking of protecting your rights this was originally posted on the forum by
[2741.70 → 2753.30] gamer dad all right oh Nintendo has a plan for lets plays and I like if you guys remember that
[2753.30 → 2760.02] whole big fiasco that was going on where oops uh oh there we go where Nintendo was pulling the
[2760.02 → 2766.34] monetization from anyone that was uploading their content so that's audio or video from their games
[2766.34 → 2772.82] in fact we had it happen back when we were playing Super Mario world on the after party and our
[2772.82 → 2777.86] monetization got pulled on that video so they just started pulling monetization back to themselves
[2777.86 → 2782.10] because I don't know if you guys know how this works, but there are a few different things that can happen
[2782.10 → 2789.30] if you're infringing content so for example um my default okay so number one is if you have no infringing
[2789.30 → 2795.70] content in your video then you dispute whatever claim and then google gives it back to you usually
[2795.70 → 2802.18] three days to 14 days later from my experience if you legitimately have infringing content in your
[2802.18 → 2808.50] video there are a couple of things that the owner can do so i my default channel upload setting is
[2808.50 → 2814.26] monetization but then I uploaded my wedding video to my Linus cat tips channel which had a song in it
[2814.26 → 2821.38] didn't even think about it, so the owner of that song went, and they have two options they can either
[2821.38 → 2826.98] pull down my video, or they can monetize against my video so that every view instead of monetizing for
[2826.98 → 2832.10] me monetizes for them and that's what they opted to do so the video is still up there and so that's
[2832.10 → 2836.10] what Nintendo opted to do is they just pulled the monetization from these videos to themselves
[2836.74 → 2842.26] and i kind of look at that and I go like okay yes i I understand you have the right to do that
[2842.26 → 2848.18] it's sort of it's just dumb it's not very it's not very black and white whether they can
[2848.82 → 2854.90] things like they whether it's a derivative work or whether it's who it actually belongs
[2854.90 → 2861.46] to is really not that clear right now legally but YouTube's allowing it and Nintendo's doing it and
[2861.46 → 2867.30] even if they do have the right it's still kind of a dick move yeah um but anyway that whole thing
[2867.30 → 2877.54] happened so now their brilliant um plan is to develop an affiliate program to share the revenue
[2877.54 → 2884.58] that they've scooped between itself YouTube and the content creator like how do you not understand
[2885.14 → 2888.34] Nintendo's biggest problem right now is that everyone's just ignoring them because it's hard to
[2888.34 → 2894.58] remember that they exist at this point in time, and then they're trying to make it really difficult
[2894.58 → 2899.94] for people to bring them into the spotlight like what do you what are you possibly thinking
[2899.94 → 2908.34] like if any and the kinds of games that Nintendo focuses on things like party games or platformers
[2908.34 → 2912.50] it's not going to ruin the experience by watching someone play it like I'm not going to not want to
[2912.50 → 2917.30] play super smash brothers because I had the entire experience from watching someone else play it
[2917.30 → 2921.62] that's stupid like especially something like Mario party what you're actually watching that for is
[2921.62 → 2928.02] like the experience of those people playing so if it's a game that's heavily story driven and
[2928.02 → 2935.38] something where I really think that gamers are going to watch a let's play instead of buying the game
[2935.38 → 2941.70] I get it I understand the developers' perspective here it's really not fair something like walking dead
[2941.70 → 2947.38] or something like wolf among us where it's or brothers tale of two sons basically just a story it's a
[2947.38 → 2953.22] movie in the form of a game an interactive game story movie whatever you get my point I get it but
[2953.22 → 2958.58] something like Nintendo's games really if anything I agree with the lets players and I agree with the
[2958.58 → 2965.30] YouTubers who are saying look we're driving exposure for your game you should be paying us to play your
[2965.30 → 2972.42] game and broadcast it to our thousands of fans so it's just so backwards details will be announced in
[2972.42 → 2979.38] the future but I'm really I want to like Nintendo I really do yeah like I was like a Nintendo
[2979.38 → 2985.46] kid growing up so many people where I was you just you're disappointing me Nintendo is the revenue
[2985.46 → 2991.14] really so much that it's going to affect your millions of dollars deficit I don't think so I think
[2991.14 → 2998.90] you have other things to focus on it's just it seems so blind like it seems like they just have no
[2998.90 → 3005.78] idea what's going on so does this all right this misanthrope and I have a bit of an off and on
[3005.78 → 3010.66] sort of good or bad relationship we're a little up and down because sometimes he can be a bit of a
[3010.66 → 3016.10] butthead and other times his butt headedness uh really hits the nail on the head and I think this
[3016.10 → 3024.18] post is actually pretty good uh it starts with, and it's okay would love for news posts to be written
[3024.18 → 3029.86] in a neutral voice I hope he changes his title to resident butthead I hope so too
[3029.86 → 3035.54] um just because you call them that I think that would be hilarious so the first line in his
[3035.54 → 3042.42] in his article, and it is his write-up about it is a developer's defence of 30 frames per second aka
[3042.42 → 3045.86] the resolution is just a number argument on crack
[3045.86 → 3054.42] so 60f this is from who is this what dev is this from again I can't remember right now they
[3054.42 → 3060.82] make 1866 I believe it is okay I don't remember the actual name of the depot so here it goes 60 fps
[3060.82 → 3067.94] is really responsive and really cool I enjoy playing games at 60 fps but one thing that really changes is
[3067.94 → 3074.74] the aesthetic of the game in 60 fps we're going for this filmic look so one thing that we knew immediately
[3074.74 → 3080.98] was films run at 24 fps we're going to run at 30 because 24 fps does not feel good to play, so there's
[3080.98 → 3085.46] one concession in terms of making it aesthetically pleasing, but it just has to feel good to play
[3085.46 → 3092.82] and I'm kind of sitting here going okay so you both understand the issue and entirely missed the point
[3092.82 → 3098.02] at the same time because you understood that 24 fps might be good for film and isn't good for games
[3098.02 → 3107.30] but you didn't understand that 30 fps might look filmic in a video, but it still isn't good for games
[3107.94 → 3117.06] it's still not responsive we actually have the fastest possible episode about refresh rates and how 30 hertz
[3117.06 → 3127.62] and thereby 30 fps is just plain not enough information for your eyes per second um coming out tonight that is
[3127.62 → 3136.02] sort of along these lines but basically here's the issue 24 fps looks good in a movie because of the
[3136.02 → 3141.30] way a camera works and I don't even always agree with that and I don't even always agree either fast
[3141.30 → 3147.78] motion in 24 frames per second looks very visually disorienting to me, you can see it chop i I don't I
[3147.78 → 3153.30] think the last one that I saw was it's not defiance is it defiance I don't remember it's its basically a
[3153.30 → 3156.82] different version of the hunger games which is a different version of some other thing but whatever I don't
[3156.82 → 3162.66] care um, and they go past this fence yeah and there are a lot of tall poles on the fence and as
[3162.66 → 3168.50] it swings past it's just like slice slice slice, and you can see the frames chopping it's so looking
[3168.50 → 3174.98] edentulous so but the reason it works is that the way that a camera whether it's film or whether
[3174.98 → 3181.78] it's a digital sensor captures light is by exposing it for a certain amount of time that's the shutter speed
[3181.78 → 3188.98] is how long it's being exposed for so what happens is if something's moving during that exposure period
[3188.98 → 3195.94] you get blur you get natural blur that's why a movie looks so much better with you while you watch it
[3195.94 → 3201.30] than it does if you grab a screen grab of it and it looks blurry and poppy because your brain is what's
[3201.30 → 3208.34] actually doing the work whereas in a game you don't have motion blur naturally motion blur is not a
[3208.34 → 3216.02] natural side effect of rendering a frame in motion you render frame by frame and motion blur that
[3216.02 → 3223.62] gets added to games is terrible because the only way to add motion blur is to either try to anticipate
[3223.62 → 3230.74] what's going to happen next or buffer two frames buffer an extra frame so that you can intentionally
[3230.74 → 3236.50] blur the difference between them that's how motion blur works in games it's a cheesy effect, and it will
[3236.50 → 3242.58] never be correct it'll never be good, and it'll always add leg maybe don't quote me on that maybe
[3242.58 → 3247.94] they'll find some genius like by the time we're hooked up to like our oculus riffs and like our
[3247.94 → 3252.26] brain probe things it may actually know what you're going to do next and put motion blur in for you but
[3252.26 → 3257.78] by that time we'll have displays that run at 600 hertz and games that run at 600 frames per second anyway so
[3257.78 → 3263.30] it doesn't really matter we don't need to motion blur in games and 30 fps is not good enough, and you can't
[3263.30 → 3269.06] compensate with mode with motion blur to make it look more cinematic do it in your cut scene don't
[3269.06 → 3276.10] do it in the game and as gamers we have to all demand better we have to ask for better and I know the
[3276.10 → 3281.94] hardware for the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 just straight up isn't good enough to run with modern
[3281.94 → 3294.02] lighting effects and all this other stuff so I guess pc I can't, I can't find where this is but um total
[3294.02 → 3300.10] here 30 fps is not a divine choice it's not a design choice sorry um it is a last resort
[3300.10 → 3304.66] when dealing with inferior hardware, and he has a bunch of other quotes too and my favourite thing in
[3304.66 → 3311.46] this whole article actually was the very end where is it so it's actually a Karachi article
[3311.46 → 3315.86] originally I'll just go ahead and yeah it's its bullet pointed actually if you scroll down but what
[3315.86 → 3320.74] he says is a higher frame rate does not significantly affect sales of a game a higher frame rate does not
[3320.74 → 3326.02] significantly affect the reviews of a game right there bullet pointed and like bolded on certain
[3326.02 → 3332.10] things and like that's a serious part of the article and total biscuit just tore them apart
[3332.10 → 3336.98] on like this exact thing I can't find the exact tweets that he has about it, but it's somewhere
[3336.98 → 3344.50] else but just like yeah actually it does sorry, but you're totally wrong and if it doesn't, it should
[3344.50 → 3349.54] and like one of the most outspoken people in terms of game reviews total biscuit which is awesome
[3350.34 → 3356.58] um constantly rips on games that are frame rate capped, and he's one of the biggest game reviewers there are
[3356.58 → 3367.30] are you that blind doesn't affect game reviews you're wrong 100 like just no oh if you were them
[3367.30 → 3373.22] what would you do what could you say you can't say the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 are crappy
[3374.82 → 3382.26] and I would rather they code their game with better effects that we can enjoy on our pcs
[3382.26 → 3387.46] and let the console guys run at 30 frames per second rather than just dubbing down the way that
[3387.46 → 3394.90] the game runs outright so i still would rather they make 30 fps games as long as I don't
[3394.90 → 3400.02] have to play them so if you're them what can you say then you have no choice but to do exactly what
[3400.02 → 3406.26] they're doing no they just built it terribly just have it so that it looks better on pc and is able to
[3406.26 → 3410.90] run faster and have a crippled down version of our console if they do that then it looks like they're
[3410.90 → 3415.38] intentionally crippling the console version you have to I mean I think okay really there is a
[3415.38 → 3420.90] solution here and I'm just kind of being a jerk right now give a give them a graphic slider on the
[3420.90 → 3433.62] console uh or not yeah or a 30 60 toggle why not I could see that yeah why don't see a lot of people
[3433.62 → 3439.54] taking advantage of that if the game can run on PS3 and PS4 then it can sure as hell run at 60 fps on PS4
[3439.54 → 3445.70] and like just yeah 36 uh 30 60 toggle that just does everything for you yeah why not just like
[3445.70 → 3450.02] turns down your resolution a bunch turns down any effects a bunch but gives you a
[3450.02 → 3453.70] smoother gameplay experience some people will prefer that and that's how you get like everybody on your
[3453.70 → 3458.18] side yep and because they're going to be like yeah it's a beautiful game unless you don't want it to
[3458.18 → 3465.14] be, and then it runs at 60 fps all right so something that actually we should probably do our sponsors
[3465.14 → 3476.26] for the show today number one is modes and where is my lower third for that uh that isn't it but we
[3476.26 → 3483.62] can go ahead and add it to that in the meantime here it's in the folder yes add media file and
[3484.34 → 3490.82] live stream assets and integration lower thirds this is really where is it I'll show you how to do it
[3490.82 → 3497.78] faster later is there a faster way to do this, but it's cool we'll do it next time uh okay you know
[3497.78 → 3506.34] what I don't know what to do right now how about you do your thing and I'll try to get it okay so in
[3506.34 → 3512.66] the meantime I'm going to throw the g, but actually it'll be kind of nice to talk about the g750 Jr without you
[3512.66 → 3520.34] distracting me for a change so guys the Asus g750 Jr is Asus's an okay it's not light
[3520.82 → 3527.94] okay it's not particularly small but what it is it is a powerful desktop replacement grade gaming
[3527.94 → 3533.62] notebook that we actually are starting to like more and more as time goes on uh the video we did
[3533.62 → 3543.06] yesterday where we pitted GTX 880m versus dual 860ms in SLI both with basically the same CPU both with the
[3543.06 → 3550.26] same 4g frame buffer was uh those tests were very revealing, and we found that if you are willing to accept
[3550.26 → 3556.02] the thicker notebook that comes along with being able with needing to be able to cool a really high
[3556.02 → 3561.22] performance single GPU because you've got that heat density to contend with you're able to get a
[3561.22 → 3567.78] more consistently high performance gaming experience than if you were to rely on something like SLI which
[3567.78 → 3573.94] is something that I've always really advocated for a single high-end GPU versus two lower-end ones the
[3573.94 → 3579.62] drawback of course is that it does come in heavier, and it does come in larger, but that way is that why this is
[3579.62 → 3584.98] the jay-z laptop and then the maybe the other one's two chains because he has two graphics cards boom
[3584.98 → 3589.78] stepped in anyway I'm going to keep working oh I'm so tired of you um and then there are other advantages
[3589.78 → 3594.90] with the thicker form factor as well we found that this notebook ran about 15 degrees cooler under load
[3594.90 → 3601.62] on the GPU which is significant and ran significantly quieter in addition to being cooler with the fan noise
[3601.62 → 3607.78] being more a more desirable low hum versus a high-pitched whine so there you go guys the g750 Jr is
[3607.78 → 3612.82] powerful enough for video editing and content creation has a desktop grade and Asus doesn't
[3612.82 → 3617.78] call it that but I'm just going to call it that because it truly is desktop grade graphics card in it and
[3618.98 → 3620.26] all right what else we got here
[3622.74 → 3631.54] oh that is faster geek steaks 2014 modes is giving away a butt ton like one metric butt ton of really cool
[3631.54 → 3637.62] stuff including an Oculus Rift uh a gaming notebook they're giving away they give away a gaming mouse
[3637.62 → 3644.42] already they're giving away a litre camera they're giving away all kinds of freaking awesome stuff and
[3644.42 → 3649.70] all you have to do is head over to their Facebook page so that's facebook.com modes, and you will be
[3649.70 → 3654.98] entered for a chance to win it's open to U.S. and Canadian residents and if you're wondering who the heck modes
[3654.98 → 3660.66] is they are an it's staffing company which is something that before they reached out to us about
[3660.66 → 3666.42] participating in geek steaks to celebrate geek pride day I was like what's that like oh well it's actually
[3666.42 → 3673.94] pretty simple for free people can submit their resumes to us, and then we will work with them and with
[3673.94 → 3679.38] companies large and small everything from startups to Fortune 500 companies to try to place people and
[3679.38 → 3684.66] the way they make their money is they have the companies that hire their candidates pay them so
[3684.66 → 3691.70] ultimately there is no drawback to an professional reaching out to modes and seeing what's out there
[3691.70 → 3695.54] which is great because if you don't have a job it's not a point in time that you want to be spending
[3695.54 → 3700.82] money to try and get a job yeah exactly right I'm going to get the paid LinkedIn because
[3701.62 → 3706.74] that one will be better, and it is a lot better yeah but still LinkedIn is perfect at like
[3707.30 → 3712.58] making you pay for it to be useful at all bugging you I know I never had a LinkedIn account got one
[3712.58 → 3718.34] recently I'm just like wow I don't want any more emails from you, you get a lot of yeahs it's just
[3718.34 → 3727.30] like leave me alone I don't care I just wanted to update my profile because it seems smarter than like
[3727.30 → 3733.46] writing a resume at this point in time I'm moving into the 21st century it's like well um would you like
[3733.46 → 3738.02] a free trial of premium so that people looked at your page this guy sent you a message check your
[3738.02 → 3743.46] trigger thing please you just got endorsed for these skills yeah it's like go away endorse people
[3743.46 → 3747.94] please I'm not actually looking for a job right now this is a core part of our system I don't care
[3747.94 → 3754.34] about you LinkedIn there should be like a please go away button like please I'll let you know when I'm
[3754.34 → 3759.70] like interested in this again please there should be an auto endorse all of my friends just do it
[3759.70 → 3765.94] LinkedIn should totally have a paid option so that I can monitor the activity of my employees
[3766.90 → 3772.42] not like read their messages but when my employees start like I should be able to see their
[3772.42 → 3778.74] activity level on LinkedIn so if I see unusual spikes like blah blah updated the profile sent a
[3778.74 → 3786.98] bunch of messages they'll be like something's coming I feel like that would be taken advantage
[3786.98 → 3791.86] of immediately like people would use it immediately, and it would be terrible and torn apart very quickly
[3793.78 → 3798.26] I guarantee you so many like owners would take advantage of it hold on a second though because
[3798.26 → 3805.54] there's a lot of LinkedIn stuff that is public like activity on it so if all yeah maybe not pms but
[3805.54 → 3812.10] if I could just get a report of activity I bet you this could be done with a third party probably
[3812.10 → 3816.58] could because it's the kind of thing that I could comb through and find myself but if I just had it
[3816.58 → 3821.06] automatically generated for me that's very interesting, so business idea for someone give us 10
[3821.06 → 3827.30] like normal yeah but make this and then sell your bot to people, and you can just have the bot crawl
[3827.30 → 3832.18] everything all the time, so people can get instant reports when they sing up yes and that's what people
[3832.18 → 3835.14] will want because they'll want to be able to see results immediately so you just have it
[3835.14 → 3839.86] permanently crawling all of LinkedIn and then wow that's like the evilest thing ever because you
[3839.86 → 3846.18] know what's funny is i I don't remember when it was but I think um easel created a LinkedIn profile
[3846.18 → 3852.18] like right around the time we formed Linus media group or updated it or something or like it is creeped
[3852.18 → 3860.42] me out that everyone who works here has updated LinkedIn profiles because I didn't have one until i
[3860.42 → 3867.46] started thinking about leaving NCI and so like i I project right like I project my own mindset
[3867.46 → 3872.50] where I'm completely not interested in any kind of social network platform even a useful one like
[3872.50 → 3877.86] LinkedIn yeah unless I have an immediate need I didn't have one until a couple of months ago and I knew
[3877.86 → 3882.18] I was going to get that email from you when I sent you an invitation on it but the only reason why I got one
[3882.18 → 3888.34] was because I wanted somewhere to put my Coursera course whatever like certificate things right and
[3888.34 → 3892.26] that's the only place you can display them there's nothing wrong with having updated credentials on
[3892.26 → 3897.46] LinkedIn it's good yeah yeah and like you know I want people who work here to build their portfolios
[3897.46 → 3900.90] and like to build their careers and stuff like that like I'm it's just one of those things where i just
[3900.90 → 3905.94] kind of like are you leaving I just lay I lay in bed at night are they all going to be
[3905.94 → 3912.50] where are they going please don't leave me why is this happening uh speaking of why is this happening
[3912.50 → 3919.46] you know my take on the steam controller was pretty mixed at the beginning I was like really they're
[3919.46 → 3925.70] doing this touchpads okay let's see how this goes and then my take on it when I tried it back at CES
[3925.70 → 3932.58] even though it was quite an early prototype was okay well let's see where they go from here valve
[3932.58 → 3938.74] has basically delayed it they're saying realistically we're looking at a release window in 2015 and that's
[3938.74 → 3942.98] pretty much all that they've said this was posted by raffia on the forum wow two this week and I don't
[3942.98 → 3948.66] think I've ever seen you before and I like you because you have an easy to pronounce name but basically
[3948.66 → 3953.70] my take on this I don't because he makes me feel like my forum's broken with his stupid avatar picture
[3953.70 → 3966.18] oh yeah all right my take on this is what probably happened was the original concept of touchpads is
[3966.18 → 3971.86] stupid, and then you saw what was happening with the prototypes over time how they got closer and
[3971.86 → 3979.70] closer and closer to a traditional controller upon which time I think people basically went oh yeah that's
[3979.70 → 3984.74] pretty cool, but the issue is that it's not really different so I think valve is going through a bit
[3984.74 → 3988.50] of an identity crisis right now with the steam controller where they're going okay we wanted
[3988.50 → 3994.42] to do something like really innovative that changed the way people use controllers, and then we ended up
[3994.42 → 4000.90] with something that's pretty samey, and we're not getting into this because we just wanted to be a
[4000.90 → 4006.90] like controller manufacturer yeah valve doesn't do stuff like that they're not getting into steam OS because
[4006.90 → 4012.50] they want to make steam machines they want to build an ecosystem valve is so much smarter than wanting
[4012.50 → 4019.54] to make gaming peripherals so I think what's happened is they just don't know what it is anymore and if
[4020.18 → 4024.74] into I think they're just saying 2015, but it's like valve time so i think they're basically
[4024.74 → 4031.30] going okay if we can when they're done rejuvenate this project and make it truly different from we'll then
[4031.30 → 4036.50] you know let's do that and if we can't, I think we might see steam controller just quietly go away
[4037.38 → 4042.82] which I'll be 100 okay with because up till now i I don't think there's a lot of room to really
[4042.82 → 4049.78] improve on the controller you see third party I mean everyone and their dog has had the opportunity
[4049.78 → 4057.62] to improve the Xbox 360 controllers, and we see like exoskeletons that go on it, we've seen like you know
[4058.50 → 4063.78] rockers so that you just shift your hand to press certain buttons we've seen all kinds of stuff we've
[4063.78 → 4070.26] seen modded ones that have the switches replaced and the analog sticks replaced
[4070.26 → 4074.18] or joysticks I think they call them now whatever I don't care if they're not if they're not analog
[4074.18 → 4081.62] any more um and no one's really been able to do it and now 360 controllers freaking awesome and
[4081.62 → 4087.62] now we're down to the point where 3d printers are becoming more affordable so even some individual could
[4087.62 → 4092.74] create a better controller if they wanted to I just don't think there's any room left to innovate
[4092.74 → 4097.38] and maybe I'm totally wrong but I think we're going to see completely different ways of interacting with
[4097.38 → 4103.14] our games like augmented reality and VR before we see a better controller I think the controller
[4103.14 → 4110.58] is kind of an amusing ancient way of controlling games by the time my son is my age
[4110.58 → 4118.34] like like like the old joystick two button style that's just gone uh well it makes an
[4118.34 → 4127.38] interesting um point because Nintendo and we also have a patent for like what was it uh modular DS
[4127.38 → 4132.90] did you see that patent no I didn't it was a DS, but you could slide out all the parts that
[4132.90 → 4138.50] interact with the DS and replace them, so people would essentially be able to like to make their own d-pad
[4138.50 → 4143.94] oh no I did see that the Nintendo patent right yeah yeah I remember that sorry so that it is
[4143.94 → 4150.18] interesting because controllers are getting like there 's's so many gamers now I think that's
[4150.18 → 4155.86] part of the thing is there are so many gamers across such a huge age gap from everywhere around the world
[4155.86 → 4160.74] that it's hard to make something for every single person in existence right so I think it's getting to
[4160.74 → 4164.98] the point where it's just like yeah make your own or buy these modular things and swap them out
[4164.98 → 4174.98] all right so um i barnacles was defending his use of bing on Twitter this week so i actually I'm
[4174.98 → 4179.62] using Internet Explorer right now because I haven't bothered to sign in to all my crap in a real browser
[4179.62 → 4187.54] so um it's true bing is the default so I searched for leap motion v2 all right so I get like a bunch of
[4188.26 → 4194.82] rubbish sponsored stuff that has almost the whole page worth nothing to do with anything and
[4194.82 → 4199.46] arguably my font size is a little bit large like that's probably more like a normal font size but
[4199.46 → 4207.54] that is four sponsored results that aren't even related to the leap motion and then the first legitimate
[4207.54 → 4219.06] hit is from the developer blog but isn't the leap motion v2 blog post, and finally it comes up with this
[4219.06 → 4228.34] google boom top one exactly what I'm looking for and i just i this just felt related to
[4232.10 → 4236.98] there we go, so this is really cool this just felt kind of related to the new ways that we're going to
[4236.98 → 4243.06] interact with our devices and what's amazing about this is using the original leap motion hardware
[4243.06 → 4248.74] they actually haven't changed the hardware this is just a new much lower latency much more accurate
[4248.74 → 4258.42] software isn't that cool it's so fast look at that responsiveness it's crazy fast love it so you
[4258.42 → 4264.02] know what's funny is they offered to send us a review sample like a year ago no, no I contacted them a
[4264.02 → 4268.58] year ago and then like months and months ago they were like yeah we'll send you a review sample and I was
[4268.58 → 4273.78] like well you know a lot of the hype has died down um do you have anything new coming that maybe we'll wait
[4273.78 → 4278.26] for instead they're like yeah we have a software update coming I'm assuming this is it, and so I saw
[4278.26 → 4283.30] this I reached out to them, they're like yeah we're at a review samples again I'm just like guys like
[4283.30 → 4290.34] seriously we can help you we just need you to help yourself like I just don't even know what to say at
[4290.34 → 4299.70] that point oh they're like yeah we can offer you a small discount and I'm just like really so you have a
[4299.70 → 4304.50] review sample for me when you don't have anything interesting and then you I'm like yeah I want to
[4304.50 → 4310.34] do you a favour I want to time this to like talk about something new and exciting, and it's like oh
[4310.34 → 4315.46] yeah sorry next time that they offer you one just take it and then just wait until the next interesting
[4315.46 → 4321.14] thing comes out yeah just be like you probably would have just waited if we did something for you
[4321.14 → 4325.46] anyway so don't worry about it, we'll get this video to you in about a couple of months when you would
[4325.46 → 4330.66] have contacted us all right, so this is two things number one is dog fighting is delayed
[4332.82 → 4338.74] yeah star citizen you're disappointing us, but there's still time for you to knock our socks off
[4338.74 → 4343.62] it's disappointing but I'm happy they didn't release it completely broken yeah I get that I totally get
[4343.62 → 4349.54] it I would rather have delays basically Chris Roberts wrote like this huge long thing it was like yeah look
[4349.54 → 4357.06] we want this out there as much as you do and I believe him, but there's two of what we would
[4357.06 → 4363.78] classify as I think they call them blocker bugs like just utterly game-breaking bugs that we need to
[4363.78 → 4367.46] resolve there's some other critical stuff that we really want to fix and then there's some other
[4367.46 → 4373.54] stuff that we want to fix but until we can get those really high priority fixes in there it's not coming
[4373.54 → 4378.74] sorry we missed the date it's coming really soon the fact that they waited until the last possible minute to
[4378.74 → 4384.18] tell us that it wasn't going to hit the date to me is you can interpret this one of two ways and I lean
[4384.18 → 4389.14] towards the second one so you can kind of go dick move guys you're telling us at the last minute we
[4389.14 → 4394.50] were all excited or number two could be it's probably because they might have thought they could still make
[4394.50 → 4400.50] it yeah yeah so maybe it's that close so I really hope it comes soon really excited guys don't forget to
[4400.50 → 4406.34] join the Linus tech tips conglomerate star citizen organization we're falling behind because
[4406.34 → 4412.42] it's past us what the heck happened yeah some random organization imperium doesn't last time you
[4412.42 → 4417.14] talked to them that was like two days ago but no one knew who these guys were well they know who they
[4417.14 → 4422.02] are they won the won like a contest a while back and all this kind of stuff yeah tiny
[4422.02 → 4427.46] and then out of nowhere they got like five thousand something members in no time at all yeah explore
[4427.46 → 4433.78] right now so no you guys need to rally with us seven hundred and twenty-six yeah uh let's see they
[4433.78 → 4439.38] have time stamps for stuff which is fascinating so yeah they're still updating we
[4439.38 → 4447.78] doubled in size again 300 new members that's on April 16th on May 2nd they got 732 members in total
[4447.78 → 4457.14] on May 25th they got 1049 members in total May 25th to May 28th they got 4 000 plus members in
[4457.14 → 4464.02] total what even happened where did all these people come from so good for them good for them but
[4465.62 → 4471.14] minus tech tips conglomerate still going to be I mean really all of this is just jockeying for position
[4471.14 → 4475.94] that is ultimately going to be meaningless once the race actually starts yeah it's kind of like yeah you
[4475.94 → 4481.06] look at any I just want to know what happened NASCAR race formula race does being in front at the
[4481.06 → 4486.90] beginning of the race mean that you win no there's a lot more yeah and having a
[4486.90 → 4490.82] huge amount of members isn't necessarily going to make you win either that's true quality members
[4490.82 → 4495.22] I'm not worried about that the main thing is I'm just confused I don't know what the heck happened
[4495.22 → 4499.70] Reddit getting huge in passing us that's kind of that's not surprising test squadron getting
[4499.70 → 4505.62] huge that's fine uh maybe they'll do just as well in star season as they did in eve and just
[4505.62 → 4511.22] disappear so that's also possible all right so NVIDIA shifts away from smartphones this is posted by
[4511.22 → 4516.74] QWERTY warrior basically Jensen came out and said okay well we're shifting away from smartphones to
[4516.74 → 4522.10] other more profitable markets NVIDIA chipsets save for tear 3 have had limited success in the world of
[4522.10 → 4528.34] smartphones tear 4 barely made it into a few devices and tear 4i hasn't had much luck as far as design
[4528.34 → 4535.70] wins go either but NVIDIA is definitely interested in other markets such as gaming devices like shield for
[4535.70 → 4542.98] example which is fantastic and doesn't get enough credit um cars for example I'd love to see tiger
[4542.98 → 4547.70] hardware and something like a TV a couple of generations from now when that is going to be
[4547.70 → 4552.74] what a console looks like a grid streaming device that just runs in your TV, and you don't need to
[4552.74 → 4558.90] worry about an extra box bring it on yeah, yeah excited about that kind of stuff I mean as internet
[4558.90 → 4564.50] connections get better I mean the connection we have here and the connection you have at home I think
[4564.50 → 4570.82] is like you get what like five millisecond pings in games and people are like yeah he's like playing
[4570.82 → 4575.94] at valve yeah or whatever like how do you have how do you have like land level ping I'm like oh
[4575.94 → 4581.94] I'm just chilling at valve HQ guys it is coming low enough latency is coming so I'm really excited
[4581.94 → 4588.34] about where we're heading there and i I really don't see this as something that'll have a major impact
[4588.34 → 4593.70] on NVIDIA's Terra development cycle it's just I think it's just them kind of basically going yeah that
[4593.70 → 4598.26] whole thing is stupid so we give up and with the way margins are being squeezed on phones the only
[4598.26 → 4603.38] way to make a profit on a phone is to be very vertically integrated like someone like apple where
[4603.38 → 4608.50] you're designing your own processor and your own phone and your own software you're profiting on
[4608.50 → 4613.46] people buying apps Samsung tried to do it and I think ultimately we're seeing the beginning of the
[4613.46 → 4618.90] end of the Samsung android empire because they weren't able to turn their own app store into
[4618.90 → 4625.22] anything functional or useful and uh beyond that what's their value I mean it's like they're they're
[4625.22 → 4630.18] already having a really hard time convincing people that a galaxy s whatever is significantly
[4630.18 → 4635.46] different from a nexus 5 which is much cheaper, and it's really just not yeah
[4637.78 → 4641.78] I don't know man what else we got for today we're pretty much done we're going to finish the show early
[4641.78 → 4645.46] I guess that's what happens when we start on time huge amount of topics though I think it's just a lot of
[4645.46 → 4650.82] them went fast yeah uh there's stuff still in the unformatted which is really let's just do some
[4650.82 → 4657.22] straight up q a guys hit us uh Atkins tech on Twitter hit us with some q a, and we'll well while
[4657.22 → 4663.70] they're hitting us up um have you looked at the open source laptop modular laptop yeah it looks
[4663.70 → 4669.86] like the stupidest thing ever right now oh yeah Apple devices locked and held as ransom
[4669.86 → 4674.98] this is kind of brutal, so there was a thing going around a while ago where your files were getting
[4674.98 → 4679.70] encrypted, and then you had to send a ransom, and they would encrypt it well this one's
[4681.38 → 4687.62] so hack into the device lock it and then so they actually are using the find my iPhone feature to
[4687.62 → 4693.30] remotely lock your device, and then they are telling you that you can't have it back so just we'll have a
[4693.30 → 4698.34] message on the screen like that locked message that says if you want it back you have to pay 100 bucks or
[4698.34 → 4705.38] euros or whatever else to some Hotmail address absolutely brutal guys um I guess that's all i
[4705.38 → 4710.02] really have to say about that that sucks I think it's going to be way too trackable though yeah i
[4710.02 → 4714.10] don't see this being a problem for much longer payments are flowing like they're going to find this
[4714.10 → 4721.30] guy yeah oh also this is really cool if you guys haven't seen it already the solar roadways' thing that's
[4721.30 → 4727.54] going on is pretty amazing uh you should check out the Indiegogo projects solar roadways they got super
[4727.54 → 4734.18] duper funded yeah they got super funded so they should 21 days left I love it this video is actually
[4736.26 → 4740.34] oh I don't know if this is even the one that i just the tractor one I think the tractor one's a
[4740.34 → 4746.10] different video yeah where's the like fan made one fan solar freaking roadways there it is yeah I ignore
[4746.10 → 4752.18] the actual one this one's amazing uh let me just put on some volume for you there solar freaking
[4752.18 → 4759.22] roadways there you go they want from me well they're solar freaking roadway okay so actually this
[4759.22 → 4763.14] time what is it okay so it's like seven minutes long, but it's actually a pretty good watch you guys
[4763.14 → 4767.94] should definitely check it out, but the main benefits are that you can rear they have LEDs built into
[4767.94 → 4773.06] them so you can rearrange the markings on them however you want really cool they're heated which means that
[4773.06 → 4779.14] clearing snow is no longer an issue as well as the flooding that sometimes occurs when snow melts
[4779.14 → 4785.30] they're solar so you're utilizing all that area to collect solar energy which is of course the cleanest
[4785.30 → 4790.74] energy that we can have you don't have to you don't have to disrupt you know tidal pools you don't have
[4790.74 → 4796.18] to disrupt rivers and waterfalls nope, nope just sun hits the earth we'll basically become plants
[4797.70 → 4802.82] leverage the sun it's all very good stuff um there's a bunch of other really great stuff
[4802.82 → 4807.14] about it, but it's one of my favourite things is you said you can change the led son it so
[4807.14 → 4812.90] say if two people park in handicapped parking stalls, and then they're full they can just create another
[4812.90 → 4817.78] one right it can detect that there's actually a video of this it can detect that they're full
[4817.78 → 4822.02] and it can just grab a near parking spot and just be like bloop now this one is handicapped because it
[4822.02 → 4826.42] can just show on the ground it can warn people about obstructions on the road so they've got sent
[4826.42 → 4831.06] pressure sensors in them so if something falls and like demolishes a road it'll be like whoa dog slow
[4831.06 → 4836.26] down and like text on the road or if there's a deer like it'll know it'll feel the four hoof prints
[4836.26 → 4842.66] and it'll be like to dog there's a deer up ahead slow down yourself um so it's its incredibly
[4842.66 → 4847.78] exciting probably have these communicating with uh those Google cars at some point in time so it can
[4847.78 → 4851.78] automatically figure all this stuff out and go around things would love for this to be the future
[4851.78 → 4858.66] really, really super easy really, really low cost power charging stations for electric cars love it there's a
[4858.66 → 4863.30] bunch of stuff you had a twitter blitz that happened yeah, but there's uh one more thing I wanted to hit
[4863.30 → 4872.02] before the twitter blitz so um tech report Seagate buys sand force from LSI for 450 million, so this has
[4872.02 → 4879.70] been complicated so LSI bought sand force and then like what was it Arago or whatever bought LSI and then
[4879.70 → 4890.90] now Arago is well by proxy I guess selling sand force from LSI to Seagate this is an interesting move to me
[4893.14 → 4900.98] yeah where it feels like because sand force it's its kind of like in delinks okay SSD controller makers
[4900.98 → 4907.86] come and go yeah and popularity rises and falls in delinks went from being a hot item with the barefoot
[4907.86 → 4914.50] controller to being acquired by Oct to releasing barefoot 2 which I think Oct was hoping well not
[4914.50 → 4921.06] I think LCD was hoping to leverage by selling the controllers and the technology to other SSD makers
[4921.06 → 4926.18] but then their new controller wasn't good enough, and they just completely fell off the face of the earth
[4926.18 → 4931.46] and I shouldn't say not good enough the latest in delinks stuff and not necessarily the controller
[4931.46 → 4937.30] hardware but the software the technology is not actually terrible it just isn't groundbreaking enough in
[4937.30 → 4942.02] a market that is full of a bunch of stuff that performs pretty much the same so I'm looking at
[4942.02 → 4946.02] this going just because sand force is a big deal yesterday and a big deal today doesn't mean that
[4946.02 → 4952.90] it matters at all tomorrow and sf 3700 series has been delayed multiple times now I mean we were first
[4952.90 → 4962.50] shown it like what computer last year so yeah, and it doesn't exist yet um I just wonder if Ella is sand force is
[4962.50 → 4967.62] being shuffled around because they just got nothing yeah I wouldn't be surprised I'm kind of surprised
[4967.62 → 4973.86] Seagate bought them yeah it's just kind of weird well Seagate's gotten into SSDs I mean they've got
[4973.86 → 4979.06] their own branded SSDs now yeah but are they really pushing them maybe this is their whole goal is now
[4979.06 → 4984.66] they'll maybe push them really hard the thing about a SSD is the controller actually isn't a huge part of
[4984.66 → 4990.02] the bomb cost or really a huge selling point to me at this point I mean Samsung I don't understand why
[4990.02 → 4995.86] they bought it Samsung went hero mode when they went okay like because flash isn't a big differentiating
[4995.86 → 4999.86] factor because there are only a few makers of flash and no one else is going to get into that business
[4999.86 → 5005.22] without a massive investment that makes no sense, so flash doesn't differentiate controllers don't make
[5005.22 → 5010.50] much of a difference these days it's coming down to features like hardware encryption and all that stuff
[5010.50 → 5016.26] that's on Eve data loss protection, and it's coming down to software stuff like what Samsung did with Eve
[5016.26 → 5020.66] where they basically went yeah we know our SSD is a commodity so we're going to build this cool
[5020.66 → 5025.22] software that lets you use your ram to cash it yeah, and we're going to have this like great cloning
[5025.22 → 5030.10] software that allows you to clone onto a smaller drive because that's what a lot of people will be
[5030.10 → 5035.70] doing and then have it overflow elsewhere so I don't really see the point of spending 450 million when
[5035.70 → 5041.22] they could have spent 450 million trying to come up with some ideas for how to deliver value adds on the
[5041.22 → 5048.66] SSD that they already have unless they and like i just and yeah whatever I mean it wouldn't be
[5048.66 → 5052.26] the first time I didn't understand something, and it turns out to be a great idea yeah I don't really
[5052.26 → 5056.42] get this one unless there's something new in the pipeline or unless they're planning something weird
[5056.42 → 5061.14] I'm not really sure so there you go all right twitter blitz time
[5061.14 → 5071.46] um if it decides to allow us yeah if it ever actually loads there we go all right having a
[5071.46 → 5082.58] garage sale today I'm hungry I have food okay uh yeah sure why not I think I have a 780 so stay tuned for
[5082.58 → 5088.90] that what what why are you selling 780 what one what what what hold on 780 just
[5088.90 → 5097.22] calm down uh direct c u2 okay that's fine why what 780 are you upset about I just want to make sure
[5097.22 → 5102.18] you're not taking like one of my benching ones oh no or just one of the reference ones in general
[5102.18 → 5110.10] okay why are you all green uh a little green aren't we that means oh like you oh I don't know the window
[5110.10 → 5115.06] the window's open and the sunlight is bright and there's grass outside yeah that's the best guess
[5115.06 → 5122.26] I have yeah 4.1 gigahertz new Haswell okay um you know what's funny is we actually made it all the
[5122.26 → 5126.58] way through the show without talking about titan z being available now but like and without talking
[5126.58 → 5132.18] about any of the new Haswell stuff which is kind of funny titan z is in my mind the least relevant
[5132.18 → 5137.46] thing to the viewers of our show ever unless you're a kudu developer it's totally irrelevant we don't
[5137.46 → 5143.38] recommend it unless you're a good developer titan z just straight up makes no sense for gamers so
[5143.38 → 5152.10] the doc yeah ouch uh do you have a tutorial on how to build a pc for first timers uh yes many in
[5152.10 → 5160.18] fact we have the hands down best tutorials on YouTube for how to build a pc and more than one too
[5160.18 → 5164.58] so if you're like oh this part maybe wasn't super clear you can just watch another one, and we have
[5164.58 → 5169.22] nice little time stamps for each individual part, and you can jump around in the video and find
[5169.22 → 5173.38] exactly what you're having trouble installing I've actually heard I have a buddy that it's oh I clicked
[5173.38 → 5180.34] new ATV gross not that one that's not a go away go back ELI the computer guy even okay I don't
[5180.34 → 5188.98] even know what you're doing okay if you search for seriously there uh this one's perfect the 1500
[5188.98 → 5195.94] gaming one is really pc build guide why don't we go with that yeah it's all in how you optimize your
[5195.94 → 5202.50] keywords because now it's like all us so this one's perfect the one with a million views um which
[5202.50 → 5208.42] is one's pretty good uh this one's perfect if you're doing like a basic machine the Kaveri build
[5208.42 → 5214.18] guide uh we have water cooled one here's if you're building a small form factor so we cover a lot of
[5214.18 → 5218.58] tricks there we've also got another AMD value one that's mostly if you're building something a little
[5218.58 → 5225.86] bit lower end and then overkill if you're doing liquid cooling you're going to want this one so I hope
[5226.42 → 5232.34] addresses that next I guess we're going to be having a mineral oil one coming maybe it depends yeah it
[5232.34 → 5240.82] depends are you excited about this year's e3 um I'm excited that I don't have to go I'm hoping I get to
[5240.82 → 5245.62] check out Ubisoft I'm because I want to look into like assassin's creed and Far Cry 4 and whatever
[5245.62 → 5251.14] else they might be working on like uh what's it called not driver the crew um I'm excited for 2k
[5251.14 → 5255.22] because I want to see that new civilization game which looks amazing I think it's called beyond earth
[5255.78 → 5261.94] um I'm excited to check out Nintendo because they're doing that crazy like what is that new the new uh
[5261.94 → 5270.02] Zelda franchise game oh I can't remember what it's called it's like rule rule rule basketball no are
[5270.02 → 5274.10] they gonna are they going to whore out link the same way they have Mario no, no no it's its like
[5274.10 → 5279.94] it's called rule warriors or something it looks really cool but no not basketball or golf or anything
[5279.94 → 5286.18] like that yeah i got the eBay email as well uh idea for t-shirt with the word danger no I don't
[5286.18 → 5292.50] think we need a t-shirt with the word danger what are your opinions on game cube that's actually
[5292.50 → 5297.14] really cool that probably should have made it yeah you can play the new the upcoming super smash
[5297.14 → 5303.06] brothers with your game cube controller using an adapter for the Wii U that is like really cool
[5303.06 → 5310.10] actually yeah and like everyone is in love with that uh have you played watchdogs I have not played
[5310.10 → 5316.02] it um I do have a copy I don't know if I would classify what I did as playing it you benchmarked it
[5316.02 → 5320.34] yeah but I didn't really get to experience the game hello what is the highest end GPU I can run
[5320.34 → 5324.42] with before but okay go watch my uh the fastest possible on bottlenecking because it doesn't really
[5324.42 → 5331.30] work that way um sup watching the stream from my macBook bro bro bro do you see game consoles ever
[5331.30 → 5337.14] equalling pcs for price to performance yeah they're pretty much there right now PS4 is very competitive
[5337.14 → 5342.10] price to performance wise with a low-end pc Xbox One maybe not so much yeah maybe not a PS4 yeah
[5342.66 → 5347.54] computer maxwell releases I don't know I have to leave but I'm waiting for one question that I have to
[5347.54 → 5353.54] answer what would you recommend sly nope single 780 single 780 are you getting the racer blade 14 soon yes
[5354.50 → 5359.46] uh they've finally confirmed we are getting one soon what drink do you get at Tim Hortons chocolate
[5359.46 → 5365.54] milk really you go to every time you go to Tim Hortons to get chocolate milk I don't drink coffee
[5365.54 → 5372.18] right but no it's like why would you go if everyone's going to Tim Hortons oh and then I'm like I want to
[5372.18 → 5376.50] get like a meal or whatever okay chocolate milk with it because there's like nothing else there I don't
[5376.50 → 5381.22] want to get pop I like the lemon iced tea I didn't even know they had that but yeah I know I'd probably
[5381.22 → 5385.22] still get chocolate milk is pretty much the best thing that ever happened to humanity
[5387.22 → 5389.54] let's not debate that because that happens immediately
[5392.74 → 5396.90] opinion on iOS 8 being confirmed I think that it's not very unexpected
[5396.90 → 5403.62] it's another mobile operator yeah it's going to be like the other one except slightly more different
[5403.62 → 5409.22] you probably could have confirmed iOS 8 on like iOS 4. it's like it's going to come at some point
[5411.70 → 5417.54] um bye everyone any idea how valve will address the issue of Windows games not working on Linux well
[5417.54 → 5421.70] there's not a lot they can do it's up to the individual developers whether they make the
[5421.70 → 5427.70] game work on Linux is home streaming the only option home streaming is a fantastic option if
[5427.70 → 5432.10] that's the only option who cares that's a great option there are services like wine and stuff you
[5432.10 → 5436.10] have to go get out of here which can make Windows games work on Linux I'm tired of you
[5436.10 → 5441.54] they'll technically build something better if they wanted to bye all right what do you think about the
[5441.54 → 5446.98] titans I think I already answered that one since we can join multiple groups now people are just
[5446.98 → 5451.54] joining whatever and getting email invites for explore that's interesting I guess that's what's going on
[5451.70 → 5461.86] there I got 99 problems but a g750 jay-z ain't one uh Dimitri asks why no 1080p for the LAN show archive
[5461.86 → 5468.34] great question uh we switched from streaming at 1080 to 720 back when we were having bandwidth cap issues
[5468.34 → 5474.98] with our ISP um there is actually technically no reason why we couldn't stream at 1080 now and then the
[5474.98 → 5481.06] archive would be at 1080 all right so I think let's call that pretty much it for the wan show today thank
[5481.06 → 5486.74] you guys very much for tuning in I thought this was a pretty good show I hope you guys agreed thanks
[5486.74 → 5494.42] again to our sponsors Asus powered by the g750 jay-z all two of them wow there it is there's the other
[5494.42 → 5500.26] one with that matte black and that shiny logo and all that good stuff and I'm going to tease it again we
[5500.26 → 5505.30] do have another really exciting project planned with Asus in the next little while it's funny because we
[5505.30 → 5511.54] didn't do anything with Asus for the first entire year that Linus media group existed, and now we're
[5511.54 → 5516.42] like we've got like sponsoring the wan show, and we got this really cool upcoming project you guys are
[5516.42 → 5521.54] going to be pretty stoked on it trust me and uh big thanks to modes for also sponsoring the wan show
[5521.54 → 5527.86] today don't miss geek stakes facebook.com slash modes for Canadian and U.S. residents go ahead over there
[5527.86 → 5534.42] make sure you're in the draws they do a new draw for a new sweet geek prize every day to celebrate geek pride day
[5534.42 → 5537.22] peace out guys I'll be back in a moment
[5541.38 → 5544.10] seriously okay well whatever
[5544.10 → 5557.38] I don't even know what these things are
[5558.26 → 5572.90] turn it off
[5574.10 → 5583.22] okay
[5583.94 → 5586.10] you
