[0.00 → 0.66] I want to talk to him.
[1.66 → 4.66] Alright guys, welcome to the WAN show.
[4.84 → 7.56] Thank you for tuning in on your Friday afternoon.
[7.86 → 13.62] We were actually just noticing that viewership has been a little bit lower than usual over the last little bit.
[13.68 → 16.00] And we were trying to figure it out, and we went...
[16.00 → 17.12] Exams!
[17.46 → 19.10] So there's no excuse this week.
[19.16 → 23.10] You guys should all be tuning in and hearing about the latest technologies.
[23.62 → 27.70] And shaving technologies from Dollar Shave Club.
[27.70 → 31.20] And notebook technologies from our sponsor, ASUS.
[31.40 → 31.76] Jay-Z.
[32.56 → 33.38] Jay-Z.
[33.74 → 34.74] I'll tell you what.
[34.88 → 39.78] If Jay-Z is ever a sponsor of the show, then I will...
[39.78 → 41.38] I will...
[41.38 → 42.24] I will...
[42.24 → 43.20] I will...
[43.20 → 48.74] I will shave my head with my Dollar Shave Club razor and I will eat my hair.
[49.90 → 51.26] I will eat every...
[51.26 → 52.68] With all the shaving cream and stuff?
[52.70 → 52.92] Yes.
[53.08 → 54.24] Every last bit of it.
[54.26 → 54.58] Is that toxic?
[54.82 → 56.00] I hope not.
[57.70 → 68.48] I think if I actually died from consuming a product of a sponsor, they would probably stop sponsoring the show.
[69.02 → 70.60] Mainly because you're dead.
[72.10 → 73.88] There would be multiple reasons.
[74.02 → 76.12] We've got a great show for you today, guys.
[76.78 → 80.78] Towns is abandoned after selling 200,000 copies.
[80.78 → 84.50] And if you don't know what Towns is, it is a game.
[89.06 → 91.00] We can't give them everything right now.
[91.12 → 91.40] I know.
[91.76 → 92.62] So that's it.
[92.70 → 93.52] We've got to hold out on them.
[93.90 → 101.78] Apple is rumoured to be buying Beats Electronics for $3.2 billion, which would make it their biggest acquisition to date.
[101.78 → 104.84] A marriage made in heaven, perhaps?
[105.78 → 106.80] Match made in heaven?
[106.98 → 108.76] A marriage of devils?
[110.22 → 113.84] Well, I don't personally really have anything against Apple products.
[113.86 → 114.56] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[114.70 → 115.44] Let's wait.
[115.74 → 116.14] All right.
[116.20 → 116.70] All right.
[116.70 → 117.20] All right.
[117.22 → 118.82] We're giving too much information, man.
[119.20 → 120.86] There's Oculus Rift Bird Simulator.
[121.00 → 121.54] See, that's it.
[121.68 → 123.42] I'll show you too much information.
[123.42 → 128.18] That bowel movement that I had before we started the show?
[129.18 → 129.62] Wow.
[130.26 → 131.54] I might have heard that.
[131.62 → 134.78] Anyway, Amazon patents taking photos against a white background.
[135.18 → 136.36] And then intro time.
[136.84 → 138.38] No, you forgot about the Oculus thing.
[138.50 → 139.04] I just said that.
[139.04 → 140.32] How could you forget Oculus?
[140.54 → 141.28] I just said that.
[141.32 → 142.08] I didn't hear it.
[143.10 → 143.48] What?
[143.62 → 146.28] I said Oculus Rift Bird Simulator.
[146.42 → 147.60] If I didn't hear it, it didn't happen.
[147.60 → 148.52] And I said that's all the information I'm getting.
[148.52 → 149.78] It's not like you have a dash cam.
[149.78 → 151.44] And then you were like, I'm going to give too much information.
[151.44 → 153.78] That was what led into that whole thing.
[153.88 → 154.90] Oh, that makes sense.
[155.04 → 155.32] Okay.
[155.44 → 156.94] You never set up the intro, did you?
[157.56 → 158.06] Yeah, I did.
[181.44 → 184.88] Thank you for tuning into the WAN Show.
[184.88 → 191.26] Guys, our sponsors today are Asus with the G750JZ Gaming Notebook and Dollar Shave Club.
[191.76 → 197.28] The fast, easy, inexpensive, and expedient way to save time and money.
[197.48 → 199.40] Don't worry too much about the redundancy.
[199.60 → 205.16] Guys, Dollar Shave Club gives you only the features that you need on your razor as opposed
[205.16 → 206.92] to vibrating dill handles.
[208.16 → 209.92] I lost track of what we were talking about.
[209.92 → 210.16] Okay.
[210.60 → 216.28] So let's move into our first topic, which is just unbelievable.
[217.16 → 221.16] So this was originally posted on the forum by Pit5000.
[221.16 → 229.94] And Amazon has allegedly made it so that Linus didn't plug in his notebook before they started
[229.94 → 230.74] the stream.
[230.88 → 236.32] So he's going to have to go ahead and just pray to the technology gods that this is going
[236.32 → 236.72] to be...
[236.72 → 237.28] Oh, yeah!
[238.66 → 239.32] That's not good.
[239.32 → 240.74] Ah, that's really terrible.
[240.94 → 242.22] Not sure what happened there.
[242.70 → 244.64] Why the sound?
[244.74 → 246.20] Let's try that one more time.
[246.28 → 251.34] I apologize sincerely to our lovely viewers who did not want to hear that HDMI.
[251.70 → 255.00] Oh, the title of the show is wrong.
[255.58 → 257.62] Thank you for that, Nick.
[257.68 → 264.32] We actually have a new guy, Nick, who is responsible for reminding me of things that should have been
[264.32 → 264.64] done.
[264.64 → 268.48] Yes, I'm really sorry about that noise.
[268.66 → 269.58] I apologize.
[270.74 → 271.42] Did it update?
[271.52 → 271.90] Are we good?
[272.00 → 272.46] There we go.
[272.66 → 273.58] It was like, error.
[273.76 → 275.66] I was like, okay, do it again.
[276.22 → 277.50] Thank you, Twitch.
[278.40 → 279.50] You are so awesome.
[279.80 → 280.42] I love you.
[280.94 → 281.26] Okay.
[281.40 → 282.02] Well, that's better.
[282.20 → 282.46] All right.
[282.86 → 285.64] So Pit5000 posts...
[286.30 → 287.42] This is great.
[287.42 → 293.18] An article that originally appeared on Gizmodo.com about Amazon's revolutionary new patent,
[293.18 → 296.02] taking photos on a white background.
[296.22 → 302.54] Now, to be clear, this isn't pure patent troll shatter.
[302.64 → 302.88] Yeah.
[302.88 → 306.06] It's just mostly patent troll shatter.
[306.34 → 314.14] And to be clear, patent troll mostly refers to when the company uses their patents...
[314.14 → 316.02] To be aggressive about things and attack people.
[316.14 → 317.08] To attack others.
[317.08 → 324.12] And really, the funniest thing about this patent to me is not that Amazon filed for it or that
[324.12 → 327.08] it was granted, but that...
[328.08 → 329.22] No, I don't know what it is.
[329.22 → 333.24] I'm least surprised that they filed for it because big companies just file for everything.
[333.42 → 333.60] Yeah.
[333.60 → 335.20] Just to see if they can make something stick.
[335.20 → 338.78] Like, I'm extremely surprised it was ever granted, and I'm sure they are too.
[339.12 → 342.12] But there's some specific interesting things.
[342.20 → 348.18] They go down into specifics on the level of how much wattage the lights use, what ISO your
[348.18 → 350.76] camera has to be at, what f-stop your camera has to be at.
[350.78 → 351.48] Here's a diagram.
[351.70 → 354.46] Exact positioning of all the lights and all the cameras.
[354.60 → 356.86] Like, it's insanely specific.
[356.86 → 358.70] If you go...
[358.70 → 358.92] Yeah.
[359.08 → 365.90] You can see some of it here, and if you go to the second source in the dock, you can actually
[365.90 → 368.78] scroll down and then see all the crazy specifics that are on there.
[369.36 → 370.60] So the second source right there.
[370.74 → 370.90] Yeah.
[370.98 → 373.44] So here's the actual patent office.
[374.18 → 374.26] Yeah.
[374.30 → 375.64] I'm just going to switch over there.
[376.64 → 377.70] So, I mean...
[377.70 → 377.92] Okay.
[378.02 → 380.22] I guess the thing that surprises me...
[380.22 → 380.66] Here.
[380.84 → 382.14] These are all the crazy specifics.
[382.14 → 382.24] Yeah.
[382.24 → 386.12] So, wherein the second rear light source is further positioned at a distance above the floor
[386.12 → 390.36] that is about 1.5 to 2.5 times the first distance and oriented at a downward 45-degree angle
[390.36 → 391.06] relative to the floor.
[391.18 → 392.84] And it's like this entire thing.
[393.20 → 394.94] So, you know what?
[395.08 → 395.30] No.
[395.60 → 399.44] The thing that surprises me is that Amazon filed for this.
[399.60 → 399.82] Yeah.
[400.18 → 401.78] As opposed to that it was granted.
[401.90 → 403.72] Because it's specific enough.
[404.62 → 409.40] Basically, the idea is that Amazon doesn't want to waste resources.
[409.40 → 410.50] And really, no one does.
[410.50 → 414.50] They don't want to waste resources touching things up in post-processing.
[414.50 → 418.42] We waste a fair bit of time around here using a green screen.
[418.42 → 423.40] Because when you have a green screen, if the lights aren't exactly the same that time,
[423.50 → 428.16] or the actor stands a little bit further back or further forward, or whatever the case may
[428.16 → 431.96] be, you can end up with a situation where you have to touch it up, and you have to tweak
[431.96 → 433.30] it in order to get it to look right.
[433.88 → 434.24] Amazon's...
[434.24 → 435.96] You won't be able to tell because of the pixels.
[436.32 → 436.74] That's right.
[436.74 → 437.24] Right.
[437.24 → 440.58] Amazon's technique requires no touch-ups.
[441.16 → 442.94] And that's what they're patenting.
[443.00 → 447.62] They're patenting a perfect technique for taking photos on a white background so that
[447.62 → 449.44] no touch-ups are required.
[449.62 → 452.34] So, I can kind of see why it would be granted.
[452.70 → 455.86] The thing I don't understand is why Amazon bothered to file it.
[455.92 → 457.16] Because of two things.
[457.16 → 463.64] Number one is that by filing this extremely detailed patent, all they've effectively done
[463.64 → 469.36] is given anyone and their dog the ability to replicate their supposed perfect technique
[469.36 → 470.78] that has never been done before.
[470.92 → 471.12] Yeah.
[471.22 → 472.90] For taking perfect product photos.
[473.22 → 479.16] The other thing is that they could never prove that anyone reading this patent and replicating
[479.16 → 481.28] their exact technique used it.
[481.28 → 486.08] Someone could just say, oh, well, no, I had the pedestal slightly lower.
[486.22 → 488.28] It was at 39.5 degrees.
[489.78 → 490.22] So...
[490.22 → 493.86] There's so many very specific things that you could change by a very small amount and then
[493.86 → 494.46] dodge the patent.
[494.68 → 499.22] So, I don't understand the point of it.
[501.56 → 503.70] Maybe you guys can enlighten me.
[503.78 → 504.20] You know what?
[504.28 → 505.12] Twitter blitz.
[506.34 → 507.48] Obviously, I know.
[507.48 → 511.54] I don't need to see the usual rant about how the patent system is flawed.
[512.20 → 513.02] We know.
[513.20 → 514.04] Everyone knows that.
[514.04 → 514.80] It's terrible.
[515.02 → 515.48] And this...
[515.48 → 517.94] Honestly, this is going to help that case a lot.
[518.00 → 518.36] Yeah.
[518.64 → 520.06] Because, like, this is ridiculous.
[520.46 → 521.72] I mean, it is ridiculous.
[522.06 → 526.02] But with some of the stuff that we've seen get through, it doesn't surprise me that it
[526.02 → 526.58] got approved.
[526.84 → 532.52] But I would like to hear you guys say, you know, does this seem like the kind of thing
[532.52 → 534.80] that Amazon should have even bothered with?
[534.80 → 538.16] Or does it seem like the kind of thing that they...
[538.16 → 539.36] Well, yeah.
[540.48 → 542.98] There's only really one answer here, isn't there?
[543.06 → 543.56] You know what?
[543.92 → 545.20] Random Twitter blitz.
[545.42 → 548.82] Hit us up on at Linus Tech and let us know something.
[549.48 → 549.92] Anything.
[550.16 → 550.94] We love you guys.
[551.02 → 552.48] We just want to hear from you.
[553.24 → 554.62] You never call.
[558.02 → 562.10] Oh, how funny that it's Mother's Day coming up and that's the first thing on your mind.
[562.74 → 563.78] I was...
[563.78 → 565.14] Guilty conscience much?
[565.14 → 565.22] Not yesterday, but the day before.
[565.48 → 566.40] I was, like, just there.
[566.52 → 567.30] Guilty conscience.
[567.30 → 568.78] I've been to my parents' house twice this week.
[568.80 → 569.22] Guilty conscience.
[569.50 → 570.34] And the week's not even over.
[570.44 → 574.72] I tried to go visit my mom, but she was too busy with her grandson at the pond to take
[574.72 → 575.46] her phone with her.
[575.52 → 578.14] So I sat in the parking lot at their apartment building for an hour.
[578.94 → 580.70] I was able to make good use of the time.
[580.78 → 583.52] I switched over from the 1M8 to the 5S.
[584.20 → 585.36] So, bam.
[585.62 → 586.50] When's your review coming for that?
[586.50 → 587.24] Thanks to my mom.
[587.34 → 588.44] I'm an Apple user again.
[588.44 → 592.86] It's going to be coming probably not this weekend, but next weekend is the plan.
[592.96 → 598.48] So I'll be doing, like, a retrospective, what it was like being an iOS user and then
[598.48 → 600.62] an Android user, now an iOS user again.
[600.72 → 602.52] But I'll spoil the ending for you guys.
[602.60 → 604.22] I am switching back to the 1M8.
[604.60 → 604.82] Oh.
[604.82 → 606.76] So that's going to happen.
[606.92 → 611.28] What I'd really like to do is give the Moto X a longer try, because I only really used
[611.28 → 613.92] it for my review, and I didn't use it for as long as I would have liked.
[614.02 → 618.92] So he's borrowing the Moto X, because he can't keep his phones in one place, or not broken.
[619.28 → 623.54] But I'd like to give the Moto X another shot, and then I'll probably end up on the 1M8 again.
[625.48 → 630.46] One thing I like about the Moto X is that, you know, I don't know if the 1M8 can do this,
[630.48 → 631.70] but I found a lot of Android phones.
[631.96 → 633.84] The OK Google thing doesn't really work.
[634.82 → 636.48] Siri is amazing.
[636.90 → 639.92] With Moto X, you can just say, OK Google, and it'll start working.
[639.94 → 640.44] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[640.44 → 640.94] That's unique.
[641.56 → 641.76] Yeah.
[641.86 → 642.02] Yeah.
[642.20 → 643.20] But, like, ugh.
[643.34 → 644.26] Why isn't that on everything?
[645.40 → 647.40] Siri is amazing.
[647.58 → 648.52] I've never used it.
[648.54 → 649.76] So, get this.
[649.80 → 651.12] I didn't even know if it could do this.
[651.12 → 656.46] The thing about Google now is that you have to kind of, like, Google what it can do,
[656.64 → 658.52] and then you have to, like, remember what it can do.
[658.60 → 659.28] It's not intuitive.
[660.04 → 662.42] Last night, I set an alarm for 8.30.
[663.14 → 666.90] And I was like, my wife was like, you're not going to get up at 8.30.
[666.98 → 668.40] I was like, no, no, I'm going to get up at 8.30.
[668.44 → 670.28] She's like, you're not going to get up at 8.30.
[670.44 → 671.48] I'm going to wake up.
[671.86 → 673.44] I'm not going to be able to go back to sleep.
[673.90 → 675.54] And you're not going to get up until 9.
[675.78 → 676.98] So, set your alarm until 9.
[677.04 → 678.60] And I was like, motivate me.
[679.00 → 680.96] And so, I set my alarm to 9.
[681.58 → 687.92] And so, all I had to do was be like, tomorrow's alarm for 8.30, change it to 9 o'clock, or
[687.92 → 688.82] something along those lines.
[688.90 → 691.18] Like, in my own vernacular, I just told it what to do.
[691.32 → 693.70] And it's like, okay, I changed that for you.
[694.06 → 695.44] And, like, I didn't even believe it.
[695.74 → 697.62] I just, like, I had to double-check.
[697.64 → 699.56] Yeah, I don't think you could do that with Google now.
[699.62 → 701.66] And I was just like, holy crap.
[702.54 → 703.58] Google has...
[703.58 → 705.26] I think you could do it in two steps.
[705.26 → 707.82] I think you could remove the alarm, and then you could create a new one.
[708.60 → 709.70] But it's not as elegant.
[709.84 → 713.04] And, like, Google's voice calling is ridiculous.
[714.18 → 715.44] It's stupid.
[715.72 → 716.20] Voice calling?
[716.30 → 716.54] What do you mean?
[716.56 → 718.40] Yeah, if you're like, call whoever, mobile.
[718.80 → 721.94] It's like, would you like to call this person?
[722.16 → 723.34] Yes, I just said that.
[723.64 → 725.54] Would you like to call home, mobile?
[725.60 → 726.68] Yes, I just said that!
[727.82 → 728.22] Apple?
[729.22 → 731.00] Call my wife, mobile.
[731.60 → 732.24] Calling mobile.
[732.76 → 733.06] Ringing.
[733.34 → 734.50] The only people I really call...
[734.50 → 734.78] Stupid.
[734.78 → 736.54] All are in my favourites anyway.
[736.96 → 740.78] So it's almost faster for me to just be like, click on phone, click on person.
[740.94 → 742.62] But, like, driving and stuff?
[743.04 → 743.22] Yeah.
[743.42 → 745.02] Yeah, like, I have reasons that I...
[745.02 → 747.08] Because normally, yeah, I'll dial...
[747.08 → 748.60] And there are things that I miss about Android.
[748.74 → 751.04] Like, Apple doesn't have T9 dialling.
[751.66 → 753.00] Which is awesome.
[753.42 → 753.62] Yeah.
[753.80 → 756.40] Like, head explode awesome the first time I saw it.
[757.22 → 759.40] And that's how I dial most of the time.
[759.40 → 763.38] But Siri is so much easier to use than Google now that I just absolutely love it.
[763.38 → 767.14] I'm not super great with Google now, so someone might...
[767.14 → 771.36] Yeah, someone's probably tearing me apart because there's some exact way that you can word it.
[771.36 → 771.64] Yeah.
[771.64 → 772.80] So that Google now will understand you.
[772.80 → 772.90] Yeah.
[772.90 → 773.52] But I don't care.
[773.62 → 775.20] That's not a great user experience.
[775.38 → 779.14] That's one thing, even without using Siri, that I've been kind of able to pick up.
[779.14 → 781.80] Spark Fox is like, don't even start on S-Voice.
[782.24 → 782.90] Well, S-Voice...
[782.90 → 783.68] Sorry, go ahead.
[783.82 → 784.30] No one cares.
[785.42 → 789.66] Didn't they do a thing recently about, like, how much people actually use the S-Apps?
[790.16 → 791.42] It was like, not at all.
[792.54 → 793.76] I can't remember who did that.
[793.82 → 794.58] I have no source.
[794.82 → 796.30] I just, I think that happened.
[796.68 → 797.84] No, I missed that.
[797.94 → 799.42] That sounds fantastic, though.
[799.60 → 800.44] I already love it.
[800.44 → 805.04] If you've ever seen her, Siri seems more like the AI operating systems in her.
[805.48 → 810.50] Google now seems more like the thing he's using before that, but like a really early version of it.
[810.98 → 811.30] Right.
[811.52 → 812.96] Because you can kind of talk to Siri.
[813.64 → 813.84] Yep.
[813.86 → 815.40] You can't really talk to Google now.
[815.46 → 817.30] If you try to talk to it, it'll just Google what you said.
[818.06 → 820.04] I hate that so much.
[820.04 → 820.76] I hate that too, yeah.
[820.98 → 822.82] It makes me so mad.
[823.24 → 824.48] Like, no, I didn't want it to happen.
[824.48 → 824.92] So mad.
[824.92 → 828.26] If I wanted you to Google something, I would have said, like, Google search and then what I wanted.
[828.36 → 831.24] You know what pisses me off most about Google now?
[831.38 → 832.40] Is I live in Surrey.
[833.16 → 834.12] I live in a city.
[834.12 → 834.60] Right, right, right.
[834.60 → 836.80] I live in a city called Surrey, okay?
[837.12 → 841.82] And so half the time I try to navigate anywhere, it's like something, something, Siri.
[841.96 → 842.16] Siri.
[843.44 → 846.90] Whereas Siri knows what I'm talking about.
[847.80 → 850.96] It can tell the difference between Surrey and Siri.
[851.90 → 853.34] And that is impressive to me.
[853.34 → 858.36] All right, so that actually led in really well to a couple of topics here.
[858.56 → 862.86] So number one was, oh, balls, where is it?
[862.96 → 863.08] What?
[863.52 → 866.86] Yes, Stephen Hawking says, AI could be our worst nightmare.
[867.02 → 867.80] You were talking about her.
[867.92 → 869.50] That is a very bad quote.
[870.30 → 872.54] Or worst mistake in history or something.
[872.80 → 875.82] Yeah, because they're grabbing, like, the second half of it.
[876.46 → 880.78] It could be, like, their, it could be the best thing, or it could be the worst mistake.
[880.78 → 891.40] Yeah, so, so fortunately, Minimalist, the gent who posted this, or lady who posted this on the forum, has the actual quote, which is, sort of, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[891.60 → 892.10] It's good.
[892.16 → 896.26] Saying it could be the most significant thing to ever happen in human history.
[896.48 → 897.22] Oh, no, wait.
[897.30 → 898.08] No, no, he didn't.
[898.38 → 899.18] Oh, bollocks.
[899.18 → 900.68] All right, so we'll have to go here.
[900.98 → 904.86] Could be our worst mistake in history, but that is a very sensationalist headline.
[906.24 → 908.46] Ah, okay, forget it.
[908.52 → 910.08] Luke already covered it pretty well.
[910.18 → 917.30] So the idea is that what he actually said is that it could be the greatest thing ever, or it could also be our worst mistake.
[917.38 → 920.66] Because we can't predict what...
[920.66 → 920.90] It is.
[921.28 → 925.68] Although we are facing potentially the best or worst thing to happen in human...
[925.68 → 927.72] To happen to humanity in history.
[927.90 → 932.56] So they grabbed, like, the second half of a sentence, then were like, oh my god!
[932.62 → 934.74] But what he actually said was best or worst.
[935.40 → 940.36] And I'm going to post this, I'm going to post this link in the Twitch chat, because that's something that we should always do in general.
[940.64 → 940.76] Yeah.
[940.76 → 942.76] And, um, you know what?
[942.82 → 943.48] I was really...
[943.48 → 944.92] I was proud of the internet today.
[945.52 → 949.18] Because I was reading this article, and I was like, oh, great article.
[949.38 → 950.90] But, you know, I wonder what people think about it.
[950.90 → 952.68] It's got, like, a bazillion comments under it.
[953.52 → 969.50] George Dvorak here actually posted, like, a cogent and well-structured and respectful sort of disagreement with what everyone else is saying that I really quite enjoyed reading.
[969.50 → 970.88] Or maybe that's not the right one.
[971.00 → 971.40] Oh, crap.
[971.50 → 971.84] Hold on.
[972.44 → 973.42] Which one was it?
[975.40 → 979.22] Those look like a lot of very well-thought-out replies, which is not very common.
[979.34 → 981.32] I thought that was the article that you were reading through.
[981.38 → 981.88] This is the one.
[981.94 → 982.34] This one's right.
[982.46 → 986.50] George Dvorak's thing is absolutely awesome, and he kind of talks about how...
[987.22 → 990.24] I think that's PV talking to George Dvorak.
[990.26 → 990.76] Oh, to George...
[990.76 → 991.38] Okay, PV.
[991.56 → 996.98] PV, you are the man or woman, because that is a great response.
[996.98 → 1007.32] And it just kind of talks about how a lot of the fear that people have of AI is based on the assumption that AI would behave the way that humans do.
[1007.64 → 1014.78] And that it would perceive a lesser being as something it has to crush or has to destroy.
[1015.34 → 1018.46] And he kind of outlines three likely scenarios.
[1018.64 → 1023.38] So scenario A, which is that the AI attempts to destroy humanity.
[1023.38 → 1026.30] Scenario B, that the AI attempts to help humanity.
[1026.74 → 1029.50] And scenario C, that it just does nothing at all.
[1029.98 → 1042.88] And the argument that AI would probably choose option C or option B without us noticing, so a combination of the two, seems most likely if a computer were to operate from a purely logical perspective.
[1043.00 → 1046.00] What does it stand to gain destroying us, really?
[1046.92 → 1048.72] Well, probably a better environment.
[1048.94 → 1050.12] A better environment for what?
[1050.16 → 1050.64] It's metal?
[1050.78 → 1052.22] It's not like it's going to take up space.
[1052.22 → 1054.42] But it needs to be able to gain electricity.
[1054.42 → 1058.58] If it has solar electricity, we could possibly pollute the sky or ruin things.
[1060.32 → 1060.68] Right.
[1062.08 → 1066.60] If its only goal is gaining electricity, we are organisms that are using electricity as well.
[1066.68 → 1068.68] So if it got rid of us, then it could use all the electricity.
[1068.78 → 1070.70] Which assumes that it needs more electricity.
[1070.72 → 1071.96] Which assumes that it needs more.
[1072.60 → 1073.30] Yeah, I don't know.
[1073.32 → 1074.32] I haven't even read this.
[1074.38 → 1075.74] I'm just throwing in devil's advocacy.
[1075.74 → 1082.86] Yeah, I mean, so anyway, this writer makes a very, very strong argument for it probably doing nothing.
[1083.56 → 1085.96] And honestly, that's kind of my side of it as well.
[1086.22 → 1090.60] It's because we would pretty much have to program in the hate for us for that to even happen.
[1090.72 → 1091.12] Or not.
[1091.12 → 1094.72] I mean, because the whole thing, the whole AI thing...
[1094.72 → 1095.38] Is that it can learn.
[1095.46 → 1098.92] Is that it can learn, and it can come up with its own ideas.
[1099.40 → 1107.76] And if that idea happens to be a way to improve itself or to manipulate people to improve it or whatever else the case may be,
[1107.76 → 1113.28] I suspect a very smart being would want to do all that without being noticed.
[1114.56 → 1115.18] That's all.
[1115.36 → 1115.48] Yeah.
[1116.76 → 1117.20] All right.
[1117.32 → 1120.88] So, and that actually led really well into one of our...
[1120.88 → 1121.32] Oh, you know what?
[1121.36 → 1122.36] Let's do our Twitter blitz.
[1122.60 → 1122.78] Sure.
[1122.78 → 1127.64] And then we'll move into one of the other things that led pretty well into one of our topics here,
[1127.74 → 1133.04] which was Samsung's head of mobile design resigns after the Galaxy S5's poor reception.
[1133.04 → 1139.14] So, I actually, I definitely, I, you know, Samsung's one of those companies that just,
[1139.24 → 1141.28] I don't know what it is, but they're pretty fun to beat up.
[1143.00 → 1147.44] You know, like I love a lot of things about them, but other times they just make me,
[1147.48 → 1149.52] make me want to shake my head and cry.
[1149.92 → 1150.48] All right.
[1150.54 → 1153.18] So, Mark says, Linus, why do you use IE?
[1153.42 → 1158.64] Because this is a fresh OS and IE is what I'm logged into everything with.
[1159.12 → 1160.46] There's my Fox on that computer.
[1160.52 → 1162.22] I know, but I'm not logged into everything.
[1162.22 → 1163.04] I'm lazy.
[1163.32 → 1164.94] Don't forget the outro this time.
[1165.00 → 1165.60] Thank you, Joey.
[1166.28 → 1167.92] Oh, here's Linus and his Lamb.
[1167.94 → 1168.98] Where is that picture?
[1169.28 → 1172.54] Whenever anyone photoshops anything, that's always the picture of you that they use.
[1172.76 → 1173.24] This picture?
[1173.40 → 1173.60] Yeah.
[1174.04 → 1183.82] It is from a thumbnail on an ancient NCI Tech Tips outside the old NCI, like before you.
[1183.98 → 1186.52] No, I know, but you don't have it on any profiles or anything anymore?
[1186.58 → 1190.90] I used to have it on my first Google Plus profile.
[1190.90 → 1192.24] So, I'm like, how is it?
[1192.30 → 1194.72] Anyway, I just, I see it so often.
[1195.72 → 1198.34] This is, you can tell the quality of this one is quite poor.
[1198.58 → 1198.72] Yeah.
[1198.72 → 1201.56] So, this could have been pulled from someone else putting it somewhere.
[1201.74 → 1202.36] Oh, okay.
[1202.50 → 1204.60] So, I think that's how things spread on the internet.
[1204.60 → 1204.84] That makes sense.
[1205.00 → 1205.14] Yeah.
[1205.84 → 1208.40] As the patent is so specific, it's fairly worthless.
[1208.66 → 1210.46] Not like the covers everything related Apple ones.
[1210.64 → 1211.04] Exactly.
[1211.22 → 1212.58] And that is exactly my point.
[1212.78 → 1212.94] Why?
[1212.94 → 1213.48] It's so confusing.
[1213.76 → 1214.14] Why do they even bother?
[1214.26 → 1217.54] How is it even worth the thousands of dollars that it costs to file a patent?
[1218.12 → 1218.40] Yeah.
[1218.40 → 1223.88] All they're doing is revealing how I could go and build that studio tomorrow.
[1224.88 → 1225.94] Thank you, Amazon.
[1226.16 → 1226.34] Yeah.
[1226.52 → 1227.52] Not that I'm going to do that.
[1227.54 → 1228.08] Of course not.
[1228.12 → 1228.76] Because we use green.
[1228.76 → 1229.96] We might do something similar, but I'm not saying.
[1229.96 → 1231.84] Yeah, we could do it with green instead of white.
[1232.08 → 1232.32] Yeah.
[1232.82 → 1235.26] When is the NCI Ultimate NAS setup video coming?
[1235.40 → 1236.42] At some point.
[1236.50 → 1237.06] I'm not sure.
[1237.12 → 1238.60] It's up to wheels over there.
[1238.84 → 1240.12] And why no guests and when?
[1240.22 → 1241.50] Quite frankly, because I'm lazy.
[1242.18 → 1245.30] Intel Z97 is out with Haswell Refresh coming on Sunday.
[1245.30 → 1251.04] I've never understood why Intel does this, or AMD for that matter, where they launch a chipset without a CPU or vice versa.
[1252.24 → 1262.68] So, I mean, we have a literal stack of Z97 boards that I haven't even looked at because why would I even bother benchmarking them with non-Haswell Refresh chips?
[1262.90 → 1264.34] I don't understand.
[1264.92 → 1269.58] So we'll wait until some Haswell Refresh stuff lands, and then we'll get on that for you guys.
[1270.96 → 1271.44] Okay.
[1272.04 → 1273.28] Did you know about Brink?
[1273.70 → 1274.18] Yes.
[1275.30 → 1281.02] We have a Brink team on the forums that is, like, huge.
[1281.20 → 1281.34] Yes.
[1281.34 → 1283.04] So if you're interested in joining, check it out.
[1283.22 → 1287.08] We're top in Canada for, like, a few different things, and we're world recognized.
[1287.46 → 1288.14] So, yeah.
[1288.74 → 1291.04] We also have a giant folding team if you want to join that too.
[1291.16 → 1294.32] The folding team is actually bigger in relation than the Brink team is.
[1294.32 → 1303.06] David Cooper says, if you make a great AI, someone will eventually tell it to do something evil, but that assumes the AI can't think for itself, which it can because it's AI.
[1303.06 → 1303.90] I don't listen to anyone.
[1304.16 → 1304.56] Awesome.
[1304.72 → 1305.24] Jake Plush.
[1305.32 → 1305.92] Thank you.
[1306.52 → 1308.78] Rob says, I just ordered some IE80s.
[1308.78 → 1309.46] AI80s.
[1309.46 → 1310.28] Thanks to the recommendation.
[1310.62 → 1311.76] And yes, I use the sponsor link.
[1311.90 → 1312.48] Rob, you're awesome.
[1312.86 → 1313.16] Yay.
[1313.52 → 1314.46] Thank you for being awesome.
[1314.58 → 1315.76] Also, the IE80s are awesome.
[1316.36 → 1316.66] Yeah.
[1317.24 → 1318.60] I still use them every day.
[1318.72 → 1319.28] I love them.
[1319.38 → 1319.96] They're fantastic.
[1320.82 → 1321.72] I used iPhone 4.
[1321.80 → 1322.92] My experience was very disappointing.
[1323.34 → 1324.44] It was since I switched then.
[1324.88 → 1326.12] But I may test the iPhone 6.
[1326.18 → 1328.30] I'm really interested to see what Apple does with iPhone 6.
[1329.20 → 1330.34] If you don't think five days is enough.
[1330.34 → 1330.58] You need to call her.
[1330.72 → 1331.52] Oh, oh.
[1331.62 → 1340.72] This is a tweet in response to something that I was talking about on Twitter last night where OnePlus offered me a five-day loaner unit of the OnePlus One.
[1340.72 → 1348.44] And I basically told them, forget it, because what I can do is I'll play around with it for five days, and then I can talk about it on WAN Show.
[1348.64 → 1359.10] But I'm not going to do a review because, quite frankly, our review of the One M8, which I think represents the very best that I can do, at least right now, in terms of a phone review.
[1359.26 → 1365.12] Our review of the One M8 took me well over a week just to use the phone and make notes on and prepare.
[1365.72 → 1368.16] And obviously, it wasn't a week dedicated to just that.
[1368.22 → 1370.02] I was making other videos throughout that week.
[1370.02 → 1376.08] But everything's kind of like that where I'll spend a week with it part-time, and I'll be making notes as I go.
[1376.26 → 1385.58] Then it took me hours to compile into a full script, hours to shoot, and then it took a full day for one of my editors to edit.
[1386.02 → 1388.42] So I'm sitting there going, okay, so you're going to give me five days with this?
[1388.48 → 1394.16] What, I'm going to rush my review all in the name of I can play with a phone for five days?
[1394.52 → 1395.86] Sorry, what's in this for me?
[1396.04 → 1397.18] What's in this for my viewers?
[1397.44 → 1398.32] Why am I doing this?
[1398.32 → 1402.80] Even, like, our phone reviews actually started off with month-long trials.
[1403.26 → 1405.46] That was the whole thing with us starting phone reviews.
[1405.70 → 1413.26] And then even with the Te grin Note, which I didn't even do a ton on, I had it for slightly over a week.
[1413.60 → 1419.62] And on the Saturday during that week, I spent literally the entire day doing nothing else except for playing with the tablet.
[1419.62 → 1421.46] So, yeah.
[1421.46 → 1422.86] So that's kind of the idea.
[1423.06 → 1427.72] We don't necessarily do the spec-heavy reviews that other guys do or the benchmarks that they do.
[1427.80 → 1431.48] We focus on what it's like to actually use the bloody thing.
[1431.56 → 1433.32] I noticed I never got the Te grin Note back.
[1434.44 → 1435.46] It's doing...
[1435.46 → 1437.64] Ah, that's right.
[1437.72 → 1439.56] Oh, we have a really cool video coming soon.
[1439.80 → 1445.62] There's a product that claims to use UV light to clean your phone at night.
[1445.74 → 1451.18] So we actually, we got, like, real Petri dishes and stuff and, like, did swab and stuff.
[1451.22 → 1452.64] So we're going to let you guys know if that works.
[1452.70 → 1453.50] That's coming really soon.
[1453.50 → 1455.78] That was, like, immediately after my...
[1455.78 → 1457.44] I remember that now.
[1457.80 → 1459.86] I thought you were stealing company property again.
[1460.56 → 1462.10] Wherever would I get that idea?
[1462.10 → 1462.28] Unlike you.
[1462.88 → 1464.44] Wherever would I get that idea?
[1464.46 → 1465.02] Unlike you.
[1465.28 → 1465.60] All right.
[1465.68 → 1468.78] So let's move on to our next topic here.
[1469.12 → 1474.00] Samsung's head of mobile design resigns after Galaxy S5's poo reception.
[1474.50 → 1476.28] It's funny where that got cut off on the page.
[1477.46 → 1478.96] It's because we zoomed in too much.
[1478.98 → 1479.46] There we go.
[1479.60 → 1479.80] Poor.
[1482.00 → 1482.76] I mean...
[1482.76 → 1483.48] That's pretty accurate.
[1483.50 → 1485.78] In terms of parties, what would a poo reception be?
[1486.80 → 1487.16] Ugh.
[1488.62 → 1489.66] Hopefully not fondue.
[1490.02 → 1491.20] Hopefully not fondue.
[1493.26 → 1493.70] Aw.
[1495.14 → 1495.54] Aw.
[1497.62 → 1502.68] I was trying to think of some way to spin it well, and then I was like, well, it could be, like, a fondue thing.
[1502.74 → 1504.16] And I was like, that's actually really disgusting.
[1504.32 → 1505.82] That's actually a lot worse.
[1507.70 → 1509.26] Um, so, anyway.
[1511.76 → 1512.20] So.
[1512.20 → 1513.20] So, follow-up.
[1513.20 → 1514.20] So, follow-up.
[1514.66 → 1516.20] Posted originally on the forum by ET RJ.
[1516.20 → 1516.86] ET RJ.
[1516.86 → 1517.20] Um.
[1518.70 → 1527.80] So, he has resigned following criticism about the Galaxy S5's, uh, lack of, thank you for using a word that I actually don't know how to pronounce.
[1527.92 → 1529.12] Appreciate that, ET RJ.
[1529.12 → 1530.12] Okay.
[1530.12 → 1538.18] So, though the Galaxy S5's design did not actually deviate too far from earlier models, its looks and textured plastic back were round, were roundly?
[1538.18 → 1539.62] I'm not even reading this anymore.
[1539.62 → 1541.70] You're from, like, the UK, and you're writing it wrong.
[1541.70 → 1545.56] So, basically, reviewers didn't like the build quality.
[1545.76 → 1547.28] They didn't like the backing material.
[1547.44 → 1549.62] I don't know what people didn't like about the backing material.
[1549.74 → 1550.36] I liked it.
[1550.74 → 1551.36] It's different.
[1551.50 → 1552.28] It's easier to grip.
[1552.82 → 1553.62] I'm not against it.
[1553.62 → 1553.90] Yeah.
[1554.00 → 1556.48] Like, I actually quite like the backing of the Galaxy S5.
[1556.56 → 1559.74] It's one of the things I did like about it, because I don't like Touch ID, that's for sure.
[1560.26 → 1569.60] I mean, honestly, I think the criticism of the S5 is less about the S5 not being a solid incremental improvement.
[1569.98 → 1572.98] Honestly, the build quality feels a lot better than the S4 to me.
[1572.98 → 1574.60] It has less flex in it by far.
[1574.72 → 1577.36] It's waterproof, or water-resistant, rather, and all that stuff.
[1577.50 → 1587.66] But I think it's more to do with the phone community getting bored and not actually recognizing their own boredom for what it is.
[1588.38 → 1597.94] It's harder for them to find things to get excited about compared to, in the past, when there were so many amazing new innovations coming with every new smartphone.
[1597.94 → 1599.68] And we've talked about this a fair bit on the show.
[1599.68 → 1610.00] But it's kind of like PC enthusiasts saying, you know, MSI or Abuses or whoever's new motherboard isn't exciting, therefore it sucks.
[1610.74 → 1613.16] Well, really, it's just mature now.
[1613.32 → 1614.92] And it's not changing much anymore.
[1615.30 → 1617.86] And you're just not into it that much anymore.
[1618.14 → 1624.32] And I think people are not recognizing that they're losing the interest, maybe not in the software side.
[1624.40 → 1627.74] I think there's still a lot of innovation to happen on the software side of things.
[1627.74 → 1636.86] But in terms of the hardware, we've all basically consolidated down to, you know, an iPhone 1 of various sizes or shapes.
[1637.22 → 1638.80] Yeah, that's very, very similar.
[1639.50 → 1644.62] One thing that I like, like, every single time we bring this up, I bring up LG, because they did move the buttons to the back.
[1644.70 → 1649.96] Like, there are things you can do with layout and stuff that still has been untried yet.
[1649.96 → 1652.86] And there's going to be things like virtual keyboards and stuff that people are going to be working on.
[1652.92 → 1658.96] But it's not going to be, like, major, drastic, game-changing things on every single phone release.
[1658.96 → 1663.64] So that's what I think this is.
[1663.78 → 1673.12] I mean, you know, despite the perceived lack of beauty, Samsung managed to sell 86 million smartphones in Q4 last year, widening its lead over Apple.
[1673.28 → 1677.96] But Samsung is apparently struggling to make a profit on its phone, thanks in part to...
[1678.58 → 1680.32] I hate the way this is written.
[1680.48 → 1684.16] Anyway, they spend a lot on marketing, so that's costing them a lot.
[1684.16 → 1692.18] But I guess that's all there is to really say about that, does I think it's just people not being excited about the phones in general.
[1692.52 → 1694.88] And not that Samsung is particularly doing anything wrong.
[1695.04 → 1700.32] I mean, they are doing things wrong, but they're not doing anything really new wrong.
[1700.56 → 1704.02] Like, they're still making touch whiz for old people.
[1704.60 → 1704.74] Right.
[1704.74 → 1708.42] Which, like, I don't know how to fix something like that.
[1708.42 → 1716.24] Because when you've cornered the market on old people who can't see their screens very well, it's not like you want to go ahead and change all your UI elements and make them small.
[1716.64 → 1718.88] But you could have, like, a scaling option or something.
[1719.08 → 1720.92] Yeah, you could have scaling that works better, I guess.
[1721.10 → 1721.84] That's an option.
[1724.04 → 1726.02] Alright, so...
[1726.02 → 1728.86] I was looking for a segue here, and I've got nothing.
[1729.04 → 1729.86] No, I don't think so.
[1729.88 → 1731.66] But this is absolutely brutal.
[1731.66 → 1740.12] I mean, when I first heard about this, I was kind of sitting there going, well, Geez, I hope this doesn't go anywhere, because we review things.
[1740.60 → 1742.70] And sometimes we say negative things about them.
[1743.12 → 1745.84] So you were actually looking into this a fair bit, I thought.
[1745.92 → 1746.72] Do you want to cover this one?
[1747.10 → 1748.18] I've done a lot of talking.
[1748.58 → 1751.34] I was, but I don't know where it's really going to go.
[1751.50 → 1755.08] Amazon asked them really hardcore, really quickly.
[1755.24 → 1756.92] Well, you're skipping to the ending.
[1757.04 → 1758.28] You haven't told them what happened yet.
[1758.28 → 1765.38] I don't, like, okay, so someone posted a review, and then Media Bridge freaked out.
[1765.92 → 1769.32] People are saying that Media Bridge has had falsified or faked reviews in the past.
[1769.68 → 1772.42] And then this one crazy inflammatory review was terrible.
[1772.52 → 1777.64] Media Bridge came back saying that, oh, you cost all these people jobs and all this kind of stuff by posting this review.
[1777.80 → 1779.86] And it's inflammatory, so we're going to go after you.
[1781.80 → 1784.64] I'm not exactly what sure happened between them at that point.
[1784.64 → 1786.96] But then Amazon asked them completely.
[1786.96 → 1789.08] They cannot sell through Amazon anymore.
[1789.48 → 1795.82] I believe that still does mean that other sellers through Amazon could sell their products.
[1796.12 → 1796.22] Right.
[1796.38 → 1800.46] But they can't sell as an Amazon product, which will probably hurt them a lot.
[1800.52 → 1801.48] Because I know at least me.
[1801.54 → 1803.00] I know there's people that don't care.
[1803.08 → 1806.38] But personally, if I'm buying something off Amazon, it has to come from Amazon.
[1806.78 → 1807.50] Or else.
[1807.56 → 1807.74] Really?
[1807.78 → 1808.90] Why am I buying it off Amazon?
[1809.20 → 1811.76] Oh, I just buy stuff off Amazon Marketplace all the time.
[1811.76 → 1819.02] And the reason is that Amazon Marketplace means you have Amazon's customer service as a protective backup.
[1819.02 → 1820.00] I've tried that before.
[1820.84 → 1821.72] Didn't really work.
[1821.84 → 1822.06] Really?
[1822.90 → 1823.16] Oh.
[1823.42 → 1823.66] I don't know.
[1823.66 → 1825.18] They were like, yeah, we can't really do much.
[1825.24 → 1825.76] It's not us.
[1826.30 → 1827.06] I was like, okay.
[1827.62 → 1828.14] Oh, wow.
[1828.36 → 1828.56] Yeah.
[1828.56 → 1830.72] That's why I personally only do it through Amazon.
[1830.90 → 1831.58] I have done it.
[1832.42 → 1832.82] Example.
[1832.98 → 1833.82] I have done it before.
[1834.26 → 1834.46] Right.
[1834.48 → 1835.84] And it totally didn't work out at all.
[1836.02 → 1837.14] I bought an old school game.
[1837.84 → 1839.78] And it came in the box and stuff, and it was a perfect price.
[1839.94 → 1840.90] And I ordered it online.
[1841.20 → 1845.00] And I've never really liked ordering old school games online.
[1845.26 → 1845.38] Right.
[1845.38 → 1846.26] Because it's very possible.
[1846.32 → 1850.84] Like, the game store that I buy from locally, they have like a nine-day return thing.
[1851.00 → 1852.86] So you can go home, make sure the game actually works.
[1853.16 → 1853.26] Right.
[1853.26 → 1854.20] Because it's probably ancient.
[1854.84 → 1854.96] Right.
[1854.96 → 1858.38] And then if it doesn't work, you can get your money back online that can be part of kind
[1858.38 → 1858.78] of an issue.
[1858.92 → 1859.00] Right.
[1859.30 → 1861.46] Sometimes it's not even worth the cost of shipping it back.
[1861.68 → 1861.92] Yeah.
[1862.08 → 1862.80] It depends.
[1862.92 → 1864.64] This time it didn't work.
[1864.90 → 1868.18] And I was like, okay, well, I want my money back because it was a nice inbox game.
[1868.44 → 1869.66] And it did cost a little bit of money.
[1870.30 → 1871.46] And they weren't responding.
[1871.62 → 1873.70] So I went to Amazon customer service, and they were like, well.
[1874.74 → 1875.02] Huh.
[1875.30 → 1875.80] I don't know.
[1876.02 → 1876.60] Well, there you go.
[1876.68 → 1876.94] Okay.
[1877.28 → 1878.28] Well, you learn something every day.
[1878.28 → 1883.92] So basically, so what it looked like was going to happen here at first was that just, you
[1883.92 → 1890.16] know, a guy posted a negative review where I, okay, the negative review did contain some
[1890.16 → 1895.20] pretty specific criticisms of Media Bridge slash Media Link.
[1895.20 → 1900.64] And that was that it was just a rebadged router, which honestly, a lot of consumers think that
[1900.64 → 1901.64] that's a huge deal.
[1901.96 → 1902.54] It's not.
[1902.86 → 1904.96] Most things that you're going to be buying are actually rebadged.
[1905.06 → 1909.64] Have you ever bought, you know, like, and it depends on how you even want to define like
[1909.64 → 1910.42] rebadged.
[1910.54 → 1912.96] Have you ever bought a D-Link wireless adapter?
[1913.68 → 1918.80] Because it's just going to have an At heros or Marvell chipset on a PCB.
[1919.14 → 1921.14] That's just going to be basically a reference design.
[1921.28 → 1922.94] With some plastic thing around it.
[1922.94 → 1923.44] With a plastic thing.
[1923.44 → 1924.26] Is that a rebadge?
[1924.26 → 1924.74] I don't know.
[1924.98 → 1928.68] Is that an integrated product from a supplier and that they sell to the consumer?
[1928.84 → 1929.26] Probably.
[1929.54 → 1930.10] I don't know.
[1930.52 → 1932.56] So, I mean, maybe it was a rebadge.
[1932.60 → 1933.26] Maybe it wasn't.
[1933.58 → 1939.74] What the reviewer also said was that, okay, so said it was blah, blah, blah, said that they
[1939.74 → 1945.86] had falsified other reviews on Amazon in order to make their products seem better than they
[1945.86 → 1948.62] are, which is a pretty serious accusation.
[1948.62 → 1954.00] And so if they were going to go after him for libel, then that would be potentially,
[1954.00 → 1956.08] there would potentially be a case there.
[1956.66 → 1962.92] And then the problem, though, is that what Media Bridge did is they came back saying, you
[1962.92 → 1964.00] have harmed Media Bridge.
[1964.08 → 1966.78] We intend to hold you liable for all damages sustained.
[1967.22 → 1971.18] They said he must delete his negative product review on Amazon within three days of receiving
[1971.18 → 1971.54] the letter.
[1971.54 → 1975.96] Stop all defamatory and injurious conduct toward the company and agree never to purchase or
[1975.96 → 1978.64] comment on a Media Bridge product again.
[1978.64 → 1985.96] So, the reviewer has actually since changed the review to remove the statements, but, you
[1985.96 → 1990.84] know, I think that that's not, yeah.
[1991.84 → 1992.86] This quote, too.
[1992.90 → 1994.36] The damage is just kind of done at this point.
[1994.44 → 1997.94] The quote about the reviewer removing the statement is kind of interesting because it
[1997.94 → 1998.96] goes exactly like this.
[1999.24 → 2004.58] The reviewer has since changed his review completely to remove the libels statements, but unfortunately
[2004.58 → 2007.48] not before having an army attack us on the internet.
[2007.50 → 2008.76] Yeah, this is from Media Bridge.
[2009.16 → 2015.54] So, they're basically accusing the reviewer of, you know, colluding with other internet
[2015.54 → 2018.66] denizens to go and, like, thumbs up the review.
[2018.66 → 2023.34] Because it was a big part of the problem for Media Link, I guess, is that it was the most
[2023.34 → 2024.76] helpful negative review.
[2025.34 → 2027.94] And honestly, those are the ones that people see.
[2028.08 → 2030.70] The most helpful positive one, the most helpful negative one.
[2030.70 → 2034.38] And it had a bunch of people thumbing it up saying it was helpful, so.
[2035.32 → 2042.00] And, like, sometimes I see Reddit as just a pack of dogs that needs something to go after
[2042.00 → 2042.56] all the time.
[2042.84 → 2043.58] It could be positive.
[2043.78 → 2044.46] It could be negative.
[2044.58 → 2045.22] It could be whatever.
[2045.56 → 2049.36] And, like, maybe it just happened that there was no other really super important, super
[2049.36 → 2051.60] positive or super negative news at that point in time.
[2051.86 → 2053.58] And it hit Reddit at the right point in time.
[2053.66 → 2054.40] They're just like, rah!
[2054.74 → 2055.76] Because that happens.
[2056.24 → 2056.84] Yeah, I mean.
[2056.96 → 2057.64] That's definitely a thing.
[2057.64 → 2061.50] It's funny they use the word army because you could probably describe the Reddit community
[2061.50 → 2062.62] as an army sometimes.
[2063.16 → 2067.56] You know who that army works for exactly, we're not sure.
[2067.80 → 2068.54] Not entirely, yeah.
[2068.54 → 2070.08] For the people in theory, I guess.
[2070.16 → 2074.62] But sometimes, you know, an army of the people without, you know, clear leadership and a clear
[2074.62 → 2077.50] sort of direction can just kind of do things.
[2078.00 → 2081.10] And whether they were wrong here or not, actually hard to say.
[2081.10 → 2085.40] I mean, it's possible that Media Bridge was totally off base.
[2085.68 → 2091.58] It's possible that the reviewer was totally off base and saying things that just blatantly
[2091.58 → 2092.36] weren't true.
[2092.54 → 2097.12] But then it's always better to communicate with that person rather than having a lawyer
[2097.12 → 2097.86] do the communication.
[2098.14 → 2099.14] Yeah, or just prove them wrong.
[2099.28 → 2099.42] Yeah.
[2099.50 → 2106.02] I mean, that's the issue to me is when you, when the opening salvo is done this or else,
[2106.26 → 2107.96] cease and desist or else.
[2107.96 → 2112.98] The opening salvo should be, hey, um, yo, do you mind?
[2113.26 → 2113.98] Yeah, yeah.
[2114.12 → 2117.60] And then if that's a problem, well, then you get the lawyers involved.
[2117.70 → 2122.30] Or like talk to Amazon about their review service and try to bring up the whole like,
[2122.40 → 2126.96] oh, well, he posted like surprisingly positive reviews on other people's things just to make
[2126.96 → 2128.76] ours look terrible and theirs look good and all that kind of stuff.
[2128.84 → 2130.04] Talk to Amazon about that.
[2130.54 → 2131.26] Talk to him.
[2131.36 → 2134.34] Try and prove that you're not rebadging, even though that probably doesn't matter.
[2134.46 → 2135.94] Try and prove all these other different things.
[2135.94 → 2140.88] Then you get posed as the good person and then the Reddit army gets behind you instead of
[2140.88 → 2141.46] in front of you.
[2141.68 → 2142.50] Good old Reddit army.
[2143.70 → 2144.50] All right.
[2144.64 → 2150.84] So we've got our next topic here and that is that the developers, this is just, oh, this
[2150.84 → 2151.40] is interesting.
[2151.76 → 2152.86] This is terrible.
[2152.86 → 2158.92] So the I think the official post saying that he was actually taking it down wasn't even
[2158.92 → 2160.56] done by the original developer.
[2160.98 → 2162.02] Let's see here.
[2165.52 → 2166.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2166.50 → 2168.24] It wasn't even done by the original developer.
[2168.34 → 2173.68] It was done by a guy that joined on and his agreement that was that he would make 15% of
[2173.68 → 2174.96] the sales of towns.
[2174.96 → 2181.26] So it became not worth it for him personally because town sales were going down.
[2181.40 → 2184.74] This isn't, the game isn't even released yet, but town sales were going down.
[2184.86 → 2186.34] So he wasn't making enough money.
[2186.48 → 2189.22] The original creator also felt like he wasn't making enough money.
[2189.22 → 2191.46] Although the game is worth how much?
[2191.74 → 2194.80] And then it's selling 200,000 times.
[2194.92 → 2197.48] So that dude probably did actually make quite a bit of money.
[2198.20 → 2201.60] And in this post, they talk about how they're interested in making a sequel.
[2202.98 → 2203.76] Did you know that part?
[2203.96 → 2206.40] Okay, we haven't really given the audience any context.
[2206.80 → 2208.18] Did you sleep much last night?
[2208.28 → 2208.76] Are you tired?
[2209.22 → 2210.86] No, but it's pretty straightforward.
[2211.10 → 2211.96] Okay, but we haven't told her.
[2211.96 → 2213.92] It's an early access game that hasn't been released yet.
[2213.98 → 2214.36] I said that.
[2214.50 → 2215.22] Oh, did you?
[2215.34 → 2215.52] Yeah.
[2215.64 → 2217.18] And I haven't been sleeping much.
[2217.18 → 2217.66] Did you sleep much last night?
[2218.52 → 2221.04] It's like the second thing that you just straight up didn't hear.
[2223.08 → 2226.36] Anyway, it first launched on Steam at the end of 2012.
[2226.36 → 2227.98] It's an in-development game.
[2228.28 → 2230.56] I think it's through the Greenlight system that it was...
[2230.56 → 2232.26] Yeah, it was one of the Greenlight games.
[2233.78 → 2235.10] It's not out yet.
[2235.22 → 2236.36] Sold 200,000 copies.
[2236.46 → 2237.20] Has been abandoned.
[2237.50 → 2238.68] And they're planning on releasing a sequel.
[2238.68 → 2243.44] So, I mean, the original dev abandoned it in February saying, you know, we're burned out.
[2243.56 → 2246.78] Handed it over to Florian Frankenberger.
[2247.08 → 2250.44] And then within a couple of months, now it's not going well.
[2250.58 → 2252.16] And development has been completely abandoned.
[2252.16 → 2254.16] And I mean, um...
[2255.28 → 2257.88] How do you fix this?
[2257.90 → 2258.32] I don't know.
[2258.40 → 2262.30] People have been talking about contractual obligation to complete a game if it gets greenlet.
[2264.06 → 2265.36] So, if you put your game...
[2265.36 → 2265.80] But what does complete mean?
[2266.42 → 2267.06] Yeah, exactly.
[2267.08 → 2267.66] I mean, ask EA.
[2269.46 → 2270.68] Yeah, that's a good point.
[2271.68 → 2272.50] It's hard.
[2272.64 → 2274.36] This is a problem with early access.
[2274.36 → 2281.14] And then we got that guy posting on our forums where taking this away is going to hurt a massive amount of developers.
[2281.52 → 2281.58] Yeah.
[2281.64 → 2284.90] But then leaving this here is going to hurt a massive amount of people.
[2285.00 → 2288.12] Well, because there are the success stories with early access, like Minecraft.
[2288.66 → 2289.48] Minecraft, yeah.
[2289.48 → 2291.16] What an enormous success story.
[2291.50 → 2297.12] And there are a lot of games that, honestly, people are enjoying playing right now because they're honestly not that broken.
[2297.12 → 2302.26] And probably shouldn't be in beta or early access that are currently in early access.
[2302.44 → 2303.56] Like, I know Rust.
[2303.74 → 2306.30] A lot of people were playing Rust and having no real problems with it.
[2306.94 → 2309.46] Now, I know there's a ton of bugs, but don't worry about it.
[2309.54 → 2310.70] For a long time.
[2310.80 → 2312.68] And I don't know if it's released now or not.
[2312.76 → 2314.72] But, like, a lot of people were playing it very actively.
[2314.86 → 2316.26] There's a huge community behind it.
[2316.58 → 2317.60] And it was fine.
[2317.78 → 2318.80] It's going okay.
[2318.92 → 2320.30] And there are a lot of games that are like that.
[2320.30 → 2325.00] The guy that posted in our forum, I believe, was for, like, Robot Dodgeball or something.
[2325.48 → 2326.60] Robot Disco Dodgeball.
[2326.66 → 2328.04] I saw them at PAX East, actually.
[2330.72 → 2331.66] So, yeah.
[2331.82 → 2333.96] I don't know how you exactly fix this.
[2334.06 → 2335.62] A big problem is what you just brought up.
[2335.66 → 2340.30] Whereas if you put, like, a contractual obligation where you have to release the game or have to complete the game,
[2340.92 → 2342.88] if you decide to abandon it, you can just be like,
[2343.00 → 2344.18] Not early access anymore.
[2344.76 → 2345.64] Now it's done.
[2348.14 → 2348.54] Yeah.
[2348.54 → 2351.86] Maybe they can have something where there's, like, a minimum goal.
[2352.04 → 2353.88] Like, you have to have these amount of things in the game.
[2354.60 → 2356.98] Yeah, but, like, how do you define that?
[2357.04 → 2357.94] I mean, the con...
[2357.94 → 2358.34] Okay.
[2358.72 → 2362.92] The lawyers involved in writing the contract...
[2362.92 → 2365.26] I mean, think about the development process of anything.
[2365.68 → 2366.74] Like, what if...
[2366.74 → 2368.14] What if Linus Media Group...
[2368.14 → 2368.84] What if something changes?
[2368.84 → 2378.28] A year and four and a half months ago had been told to contractually commit to what kind of videos we were going to do.
[2378.54 → 2379.94] Two years from now.
[2380.50 → 2384.10] I mean, the amount that what we do has changed in that time.
[2384.46 → 2386.94] And, I mean, any creative processes like that.
[2387.04 → 2387.94] You know, like a game.
[2388.88 → 2392.38] You might go, okay, we're going to have three campaigns and three races.
[2392.50 → 2394.52] And you might kind of go, oh, this is stupid.
[2394.72 → 2395.80] Star craft's been made already.
[2395.80 → 2397.88] We're going to have six races.
[2398.08 → 2399.34] Or we're going to have two races.
[2399.62 → 2402.30] Or, you know, whatever else happens to be.
[2402.36 → 2408.46] As long as you don't just have one race, Donald, then, you know, you're being very 21st century about it.
[2408.48 → 2409.22] That's all I'm trying to say.
[2409.22 → 2411.96] And the point is that it can change.
[2412.08 → 2419.42] So the kind of contract that you would have to write to, like, spell it out in detail enough that they would actually have to deliver something.
[2419.42 → 2420.40] I don't know how to fix it.
[2420.48 → 2421.02] It's impossible.
[2421.12 → 2423.84] I mean, the lawyers would be happy with that arrangement, I'm sure.
[2424.08 → 2424.64] Yeah, yeah.
[2424.88 → 2428.80] One thing is, like, this comes back to the Kickstarter talk we were talking about a long time ago.
[2428.80 → 2433.96] And something that you guys should probably take a look at if you're really interested in this is Total Biscuit's video on early access.
[2434.68 → 2436.86] But it's where, like, do your research.
[2437.40 → 2440.38] Make sure the guy that you're supporting has, like, made a bunch of stuff.
[2440.44 → 2440.84] Chris Roberts!
[2441.82 → 2443.24] Hopefully it's a game studio.
[2443.50 → 2449.66] There are entire game studios putting stuff up on Greenlight and on Kickstarter.
[2449.90 → 2451.60] Make sure that there's some sort of background.
[2453.30 → 2458.12] I haven't read enough into it, but I've heard some people saying that the guy that made Towns has a few failed projects in the past.
[2458.12 → 2459.28] I don't know if that's true.
[2459.38 → 2460.82] I've just seen that in a few different places.
[2461.18 → 2462.68] It's like, that's the kind of stuff you want to look into.
[2462.80 → 2463.90] It's an early access game.
[2464.32 → 2466.14] You are gambling, to a certain point.
[2466.22 → 2468.46] You're not buying the game as is right now.
[2468.66 → 2471.98] Or if you are, then you're happy with it already, and it doesn't matter.
[2472.34 → 2478.70] But that's the problem, is that people feel like when they pay for something, they should get something.
[2479.66 → 2480.88] Well, they should.
[2481.04 → 2481.44] They should.
[2481.52 → 2484.02] That's the whole Kickstarter problem.
[2484.02 → 2489.50] People perceive Kickstarter as like buying something.
[2489.94 → 2493.70] But the problem is that Kickstarter is more like a donation.
[2494.14 → 2494.24] Yeah.
[2494.36 → 2500.18] Because you're not buying something because oftentimes they don't actually have to deliver it, or it doesn't have to be very functional.
[2500.94 → 2502.02] And then the other times...
[2503.02 → 2504.02] Wait, so...
[2504.66 → 2505.50] Oh, right, right, right.
[2505.50 → 2511.28] So, so, and the other problem is that if it is really successful, you don't actually get a cut of it.
[2511.52 → 2514.28] So it's not an investment, and it's not a purchase.
[2514.82 → 2519.92] It's a donation to support someone who you think should make the thing that you like.
[2519.98 → 2526.38] Like, honestly, guys, I've got what I think is a fantastic idea for a movie trailer that I want to make.
[2526.38 → 2533.32] I think that Linus Media Group has gotten to the point where we are capable of creating an awesome movie trailer.
[2533.54 → 2537.80] We are nowhere near capable of creating an awesome movie.
[2538.30 → 2539.62] They're really different.
[2539.84 → 2541.04] Very different things.
[2541.16 → 2543.40] Completely different skill sets in a lot of ways.
[2543.86 → 2546.96] But what we could easily do is we could kickstart.
[2547.32 → 2549.62] And that's the thing is a well-merchandised Kickstarter.
[2549.80 → 2555.02] So we could kickstart, support us to make this movie, give us, you know, $100,000 or whatever the case may be.
[2555.02 → 2564.10] We could make a fantastic trailer, spend $15,000, $20,000 on that, and then just, you know, buy ice cream with the other $80,000.
[2564.68 → 2569.58] Release a movie that's, like, starring me and Luke and shot with, like, a phone camera.
[2570.52 → 2574.84] And we haven't actually done anything illegal.
[2576.14 → 2577.16] And, like, this ties in.
[2577.20 → 2581.20] I think I've told this story on the show before where I've backed a lot of Kickstarter projects.
[2581.54 → 2583.02] Most of them have been successful.
[2583.02 → 2589.46] Some of them have been glowingly successful to the point where the guy that's made it, yeah, Pebble.
[2589.68 → 2591.20] Real companies are formed.
[2591.50 → 2595.70] But, like, some of the smaller ones that I've done where it is a company, but now it's, like, two or three people.
[2596.24 → 2600.82] And it's been a year and a half since I got my product in my hands for them.
[2600.92 → 2601.80] Like, it's been a long time.
[2602.04 → 2603.48] They're still in contact with all of us.
[2603.84 → 2607.46] All the Kickstarter backers are getting huge discounts all the time just because they're like,
[2607.46 → 2607.90] Thank you.
[2608.00 → 2609.18] You allowed us to become a thing.
[2609.40 → 2610.16] That's awesome.
[2610.36 → 2612.22] And that's what you kind of hope happens from Kickstarter.
[2613.18 → 2618.54] And they still allow us to put input in towards projects that they're doing in the future and stuff like that, which is really cool.
[2618.72 → 2620.14] But that doesn't happen all the time.
[2620.26 → 2622.08] I have been completely screwed over.
[2622.64 → 2623.92] I bought into a Kickstarter.
[2624.22 → 2629.12] The guy didn't post updates forever and then was randomly like, yeah, no, I didn't do anything.
[2629.12 → 2630.36] And I'm not going to do anything.
[2630.54 → 2631.16] So, nope.
[2632.32 → 2633.54] Like, 100%.
[2633.54 → 2636.08] And then he's like, oh, apparently I have to give refunds.
[2636.08 → 2636.94] So, give me your information.
[2637.28 → 2638.50] And then no update.
[2638.64 → 2640.84] And then months later he's like, well, I'm doing the refunds today.
[2641.34 → 2642.34] No one got them.
[2642.98 → 2644.64] And then radio silence since then.
[2644.88 → 2646.70] I don't ever expect to get that money back.
[2647.58 → 2654.16] And you know what's really stupid is some of the Kickstarter's I've seen fail are even things as stupid as, like, playing cards.
[2654.90 → 2655.14] Yeah.
[2655.44 → 2657.88] They just flat out didn't make.
[2657.88 → 2660.36] It's like, really, what did you spend the money on?
[2660.42 → 2667.58] And, you know, a lot of the time I think it's on, like, a posh office and, like, a nice new computer to put on their fancy desk.
[2667.98 → 2673.32] When really, and it frustrates me, the way a lot of startups behave, like, they already are making the money.
[2673.82 → 2683.40] As opposed to figuring out how to deliver the product the best that they possibly can to their customers the best way they possibly can without spending that money.
[2683.40 → 2686.34] So that they can keep that money to reinvest in themselves for the future.
[2686.34 → 2688.18] I mean, that's how I think businesses should be run.
[2688.44 → 2690.90] But a lot of the time, that's not really how it goes.
[2691.10 → 2692.26] There was recently a Kickstarter.
[2692.36 → 2693.58] I don't remember what this was for.
[2693.64 → 2694.80] I wish I had research on this.
[2694.96 → 2698.20] But they were complaining that they had run out of money.
[2698.44 → 2703.76] Because one of the employees in the company, when they're running their Kickstarter, was in, like, serious money troubles.
[2703.94 → 2706.66] So when the Kickstarter ended, and they got all the money, he took, like, a third of it.
[2706.66 → 2710.56] And they were just like, yeah, it's a cash advance for, like, six months' salary.
[2712.40 → 2715.88] And then they're like, oh, wait, we don't have any money left because we gave it all to him.
[2716.44 → 2718.08] And it's like, what?
[2719.40 → 2720.72] Are you kidding me?
[2720.76 → 2722.38] Was that somewhere on the Kickstarter page?
[2722.44 → 2726.06] We were funding this guy's, like, probably, I'm going to assume, gambling troubles?
[2726.34 → 2726.56] Like, no.
[2726.96 → 2727.60] Could be drugs.
[2727.80 → 2728.52] Could be drugs.
[2728.64 → 2729.40] Could be anything.
[2729.58 → 2731.30] Like, no, that wasn't a part of the Kickstarter.
[2731.62 → 2732.46] Could be just anything.
[2732.94 → 2738.88] I used to work with, I used to have a co-worker who, we were in sort of similar, without giving too much detail,
[2739.08 → 2742.22] I have some idea of what kind of money she made.
[2742.76 → 2748.78] And, like, the amount of money that I saw getting, like, I knew the pay grade.
[2749.20 → 2751.02] I knew approximately the expenses.
[2751.32 → 2752.26] I knew her pretty well.
[2752.26 → 2759.04] And the amount of money that I saw her blowing on hobby stuff, I was sitting there going,
[2759.40 → 2760.04] Okay.
[2760.36 → 2768.46] So you're constantly, like, asking for more money, but I know that you waste it all on stupid crap.
[2768.92 → 2774.12] So maybe if you stopped wasting it on stupid crap, we wouldn't have this problem.
[2774.38 → 2776.88] Because you make a very fair living wage.
[2778.02 → 2778.62] Yeah.
[2780.22 → 2783.68] Speaking of a fair living wage, 3.2 billion.
[2783.92 → 2787.68] Apple's reportedly considering buying beets for 3.2 billion.
[2787.68 → 2791.36] Oh, this has been updated since the last time I looked at it by Alex Goes High.
[2791.56 → 2791.72] Yeah.
[2791.80 → 2794.88] It's apparently kinda confirmed.
[2795.84 → 2798.38] So, I, right, yes, I did hear about this.
[2798.44 → 2806.10] So Dr. Dre was caught up celebrating the deal in his studio because he posted a video about said celebration on Facebook that has been deleted.
[2806.32 → 2809.36] The Verge evidently saved it to their servers prior to the takedown.
[2809.36 → 2814.86] So, basically, in the video, Dr. Dre describes himself as the first billionaire in hip-hop.
[2815.48 → 2820.26] And, uh, doesn't explicitly confirm the Apple acquisition.
[2820.58 → 2824.62] But the, the implication there is that the deal is basically already done.
[2824.62 → 2828.98] So, Apple would be acquiring not just, like, headphones.
[2829.60 → 2833.20] Which, to me, is less, I mean, yeah, it's a huge business and all that.
[2833.28 → 2835.02] But that's less of a big deal.
[2835.12 → 2841.88] And probably if Apple decided to release their own Apple-branded headphones, they could crush Beets headphones if they really felt like it.
[2841.90 → 2845.94] I mean, the kinds of people who buy Beets headphones are probably gonna also be interested in Apple headphones.
[2845.94 → 2851.20] And, quite frankly, I have a lot more faith in Apple than I do in Beets when it comes to making a decent pair of headphones.
[2851.26 → 2854.16] I'd assume it had perfect build quality, which I don't assume of Beets.
[2854.38 → 2854.86] I, I also do not.
[2854.86 → 2856.72] I don't even know, but I just, I don't assume.
[2857.08 → 2858.04] They're, they're nothing special.
[2858.04 → 2860.04] I've never bought a pair of Beets.
[2860.20 → 2862.52] Um, so, I forget where I was going with that.
[2862.54 → 2863.36] What is your thing?
[2863.36 → 2865.42] You said you have a very unpopular opinion about that.
[2865.42 → 2866.04] I'll get to that.
[2866.16 → 2870.46] Um, so, Apple will also be buying Beets' streaming service.
[2870.46 → 2876.98] So, that is, is a music streaming service that's actually, um, similar to something that Apple's been rumoured to be developing.
[2877.22 → 2880.42] So, it would potentially work on Android devices.
[2880.42 → 2884.06] So, this could be a great way for Apple to get into the music streaming service.
[2884.06 → 2887.92] I mean, music is something that Apple's been very heavily into since the jobs days.
[2887.92 → 2899.88] And it could allow them to get a chunk of that pie on the Android side without, like, creating branding weirdness around, you know, iTunes for Android.
[2900.60 → 2902.74] You know, whatever they want to call it.
[2902.92 → 2905.22] Or, or, or whatever that ends up turning into.
[2905.40 → 2907.52] So, I think that's actually more interesting.
[2907.66 → 2912.68] It's funny to me that this is actually by far Apple's biggest acquisition.
[2912.68 → 2923.58] Um, so, it's, the second biggest was actually Next, back in 1997, when they brought Steve Jobs' Next computer company, or computing Next, I forget what it's called.
[2923.66 → 2927.44] Anyway, when they brought Next back into the fold and reacquired Steve Jobs.
[2927.60 → 2929.58] So, this is far bigger than that.
[2930.08 → 2940.58] Um, Apple's more about the little strategic micro acquisitions, where they see, like, a really smart technology and, and, and buy them up before they get big.
[2940.58 → 2940.86] Yeah.
[2940.96 → 2944.86] So, this is very uncharacteristic for them, making, uh, like, a power move like this.
[2945.28 → 2945.92] It's interesting.
[2946.06 → 2949.60] I, I, I see, it kind of makes sense, though, because of how much they're already entwined.
[2950.98 → 2951.78] Yeah, sort of.
[2951.80 → 2958.70] I mean, they sell Beats in the Apple Store, but, I mean, they also sell Cooler Master, like, aluminum phone stands in the store.
[2958.80 → 2963.04] Yeah, but I bet you, in terms of revenue, Beats brings in a lot more than the Cooler Master aluminum stand.
[2963.28 → 2964.76] You know what's baffling to me?
[2965.54 → 2969.64] Is how I manage to live in the kind of bubble that I live in.
[2969.64 → 2973.20] Like, when we were trying to do the Hackintosh, um, build.
[2974.10 → 2978.52] I, the, the, the guy we were working with, Rampage Dev, who's a Hackintosh developer.
[2978.64 → 2979.20] Really nice guy.
[2979.32 → 2980.28] Super nice guy.
[2980.34 → 2981.08] We really like him.
[2981.18 → 2981.56] Cool guy.
[2981.70 → 2987.28] Um, he was like, oh yeah, to create the, the bootable USB drive, just plug it into a Mac and do this.
[2987.32 → 2988.70] I'm like, I, I don't have a Mac.
[2988.78 → 2989.78] He's like, then borrow one.
[2989.86 → 2994.12] I'm like, I don't know a single person who owns a Mac.
[2994.44 → 2995.28] He's like, what?
[2995.36 → 2996.84] I'm like, look, don't worry, man.
[2996.84 → 3002.08] I'll figure it out, but I don't know a single person who owns a Mac.
[3002.16 → 3004.50] I don't know a single person who owns Beat headphones.
[3005.06 → 3005.84] Did I say Beat?
[3005.90 → 3006.20] Beats.
[3006.42 → 3007.26] Beats headphones.
[3009.42 → 3009.78] Who?
[3011.34 → 3012.18] A while ago.
[3012.18 → 3013.12] Someone who works here?
[3013.28 → 3014.02] A while ago.
[3014.30 → 3014.58] Who?
[3014.70 → 3015.80] I don't think he still has them.
[3015.86 → 3016.68] Do I have to hit him?
[3016.84 → 3017.54] I don't think he still has them.
[3017.54 → 3019.00] I know he has monster turbines.
[3019.10 → 3019.76] Is it Brandon?
[3020.18 → 3020.48] No.
[3020.48 → 3022.96] It's not Ed, is it?
[3023.00 → 3023.28] No.
[3024.92 → 3025.36] No.
[3027.78 → 3029.68] He had them, he had them a while ago.
[3029.78 → 3030.76] I don't know if he still has them.
[3030.86 → 3033.20] No, we were making fun of people who own Beats headphones.
[3033.44 → 3033.66] Oh.
[3034.70 → 3035.06] Yeah.
[3035.24 → 3039.84] And I was saying that you have monster earbuds, but those are actually fairly well, well reputed.
[3039.98 → 3040.82] So you're okay.
[3042.10 → 3043.18] You're off the hook, Brandon.
[3043.42 → 3043.66] Yeah.
[3043.72 → 3046.00] He had the, the like small ones that go on your ear.
[3046.44 → 3047.20] Oh, really?
[3047.56 → 3047.84] Yeah.
[3048.12 → 3048.98] Oh, headache.
[3048.98 → 3051.60] It was a while ago though when he got like an employee discount on them.
[3051.78 → 3052.82] It's our new guy.
[3053.12 → 3054.52] We are all ashamed of him.
[3054.56 → 3056.08] I wouldn't have hired him if I'd known that.
[3056.18 → 3059.96] That is, that is a very sad, very sad state of affairs right now.
[3060.00 → 3062.04] I imagine he posted that on the audio forum.
[3062.18 → 3063.34] So here's.
[3063.36 → 3064.76] Just get slaughtered.
[3065.44 → 3068.98] Here's what I will say about an Apple Beats acquisition.
[3070.14 → 3075.22] I would actually be pretty excited to see a product that came out of this union.
[3077.16 → 3077.96] That's what I'll say.
[3077.96 → 3078.96] Okay.
[3078.96 → 3079.56] That's all I have to say about it.
[3079.56 → 3081.38] Guys, I'm going to create a straw poll.
[3081.62 → 3082.76] Because Apple owns that.
[3082.82 → 3083.72] Would you be as excited?
[3083.72 → 3084.64] I know that would never happen.
[3084.76 → 3086.12] I'm not even going to put that up.
[3086.28 → 3088.20] I was going to say if it was the other way around, and I was like, no.
[3089.04 → 3089.78] There's no way.
[3089.78 → 3096.86] I could have made that so you could have kept talking.
[3097.00 → 3098.90] Oh, I don't really have anything else to say.
[3099.08 → 3099.32] Okay.
[3099.46 → 3100.64] Are we done with this topic then?
[3101.28 → 3101.64] Yeah.
[3101.78 → 3105.66] I'm just going to, like basically, okay, I guess I do have more to say.
[3105.66 → 3111.54] So the reason that I would be excited about that is because Beats, I appreciate their style
[3111.54 → 3113.12] and I appreciate their marketing.
[3113.46 → 3120.36] But what has always been lacking for me is the actual build quality and the actual exceptionalness
[3120.36 → 3120.94] of the product.
[3120.94 → 3122.50] So anything good.
[3123.30 → 3123.50] Yeah.
[3124.52 → 3132.78] But what they've been good at, what they have been good at, is increasing the demand for
[3132.78 → 3134.22] quality audio solutions.
[3134.80 → 3136.38] Because people are like, wow, this is bad.
[3136.42 → 3137.24] I want to buy something better.
[3137.40 → 3137.68] No.
[3137.82 → 3138.68] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3138.68 → 3145.16] No, no, like commercials like the HP Envy commercial where they have Dr. Dre with his stupid headphones
[3145.16 → 3151.56] on an HP notebook and like talking about how better audio enriches the experience because
[3151.56 → 3152.48] it does.
[3152.94 → 3158.46] The problem is that Beats never actually delivered the enriched audio experience.
[3158.66 → 3158.70] Right.
[3158.74 → 3164.02] But the good thing they did was they made people aware of crappy audio and how much it sucks.
[3164.62 → 3168.40] So what I would like to see Apple do, so here's my straw poll, you guys.
[3168.40 → 3174.14] what I would like to see Apple do is actually build something with Beats
[3174.14 → 3179.36] branding that is good because hate on Apple all you want the iPhone 5s is an
[3179.36 → 3185.02] exceptional piece of hardware and even all even the Android fanboys have to
[3185.02 → 3191.02] agree that what's great about the HTC One series the one M7 and the one M8 is
[3191.02 → 3195.92] that someone on the Android side finally rivalled Apple for build quality which
[3195.92 → 3200.12] would imply that we never had anything equivalent before they are quality
[3200.12 → 3204.02] built products they're fast Apple actually engineer solutions that are
[3204.02 → 3207.68] good their processors that they actually build themselves unlike pretty much
[3207.68 → 3211.04] everyone else except Samsung where they're just using an
[3211.04 → 3215.24] off-the-shelf processor Apple actually engineers the crap out of things so if
[3215.24 → 3219.92] they engineered the crap out of a $300 pair of headphones I would expect to
[3219.92 → 3224.88] actually get $300 level build quality and $300 level sound quality out of it
[3224.88 → 3230.34] that's what I would like to see there's you can't possibly say that they
[3230.34 → 3235.50] don't make things well you can, but it's just stupid that's all I have to say about
[3235.50 → 3240.18] that okay so yeah you could technically say yeah you could say it, but you're just
[3240.18 → 3245.08] completely wrong yeah so there you go do you want to do a topic sure
[3245.08 → 3251.22] there's a few left actually there's a lot left here I'm going to throw those straw
[3251.22 → 3256.02] pool results up there boom okay so one that I find fascinating because
[3256.02 → 3259.20] we've been talking about VR a lot lately and yep I'm gonna talk about another
[3259.20 → 3264.24] Oculus Rift thing is that the biggest thing that we've both said is that it's
[3264.24 → 3268.92] not necessarily immersive in us yeah because not all your senses are engaged
[3268.92 → 3273.72] and that's what's fascinating about this I could engage your senses that
[3273.72 → 3279.22] wouldn't have to be VR oh god really is this the thing that you're going to do on the show
[3279.22 → 3282.48] no okay you're talking about all right um so
[3282.48 → 3288.00] wow anyway
[3288.00 → 3298.78] so a company called something buirdly I think I'm a little bit distracted right now um has
[3298.78 → 3304.28] created this giant machine thing that they're quoting saying uh you do not control a machine
[3304.28 → 3310.76] you embody a bird the red kite which is a bird by the way um, but honestly you're you're controlling
[3310.76 → 3317.10] machine um but what's fascinating about it is that it engages your physical sense so you're
[3317.10 → 3322.02] literally you're laying flat up on this machine, and then you have to flap as if you're a bird like
[3322.02 → 3327.52] he's doing right there um, and then it is putting smell into the environment so what you see
[3327.52 → 3333.68] on the Oculus Rift is pushed through towards you so if you're flying over a forest you'll smell a forest if you're flying over
[3333.68 → 3340.18] mud flats you'll smell mud whatever um, and you can see that giant fan right in front of him that fan
[3340.18 → 3345.14] will change how fast it's spinning depending on how fast he's going in the game so if he starts going
[3345.14 → 3350.42] really quickly the fan will start spinning really quickly so you're getting um not necessarily accurate
[3350.42 → 3356.32] but you're getting representative wind speed towards your head, and you're getting smell, and you're getting
[3356.32 → 3360.52] vision from the Oculus Rift this is kind of the stuff that I'm talking about it's still not going to feel
[3360.52 → 3364.98] like you're actually a bird because you're laying on something kind of flapping around, but it should
[3364.98 → 3372.12] be fascinating to be able to try they're saying that it has um olfactory what is it called
[3372.12 → 3377.96] sorry what now olfactory smell no I know but is that how you pronounce it I'm actually not sure
[3377.96 → 3385.78] olfactoric olfaction either way that's factory perception yeah so olfactory perception is
[3385.78 → 3391.04] how you smell things they have feedback on that they also have feedback based on uh which is based
[3391.04 → 3394.68] on the location of the bird while you're flying I said if you fly over four I saw that kind of stuff
[3394.68 → 3405.34] um, and then it has wind speed and actually physically flapping oh you can have that banana on your shirt
[3405.34 → 3411.34] I don't want that in my hand um cool though because this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to
[3412.04 → 3417.22] exciting things that we're going to be able to do with VR yeah and like this maybe isn't the most
[3417.22 → 3421.66] realistic thing for something that everyone's going to have in their house yeah it's like it's like if
[3421.66 → 3427.52] if we had conversations before about how I was like yeah omni is cool but like I wouldn't find
[3427.52 → 3434.28] room for it in my house like yeah I'm going to have like a dedicated like you know quarter of a room
[3434.28 → 3440.92] for like my bird simulator machine and my goat simulator machine and my farmer simulator machine
[3440.92 → 3447.12] it's like it's going to turn you know what gaming is going back to arcade size machines they're gonna
[3447.12 → 3451.02] they should get it to the point where there's one, and it's like a transformer you tell what game you
[3451.02 → 3456.52] want to play, and it just like changes itself that would be amazing somebody kickstart that I'm not
[3456.52 → 3460.14] going to give you my money because I know you can't build it I was just going to say don't kickstart it
[3460.14 → 3467.22] because you will never be successful um it won't work, but I like how you think yeah exactly um but
[3467.22 → 3471.58] yeah I hope they have this kind of stuff like science world yeah that would be cool or different
[3471.58 → 3477.70] things like that so you can actually tell us world of science can you believe that like it's like
[3477.70 → 3485.32] telcos you know can you is there another way that you could demonstrate that you have too much
[3485.32 → 3491.62] money tell us world of science rogers arena yeah like no oh no, no no, no no science world goes beyond
[3491.62 → 3498.02] that so sponsoring arenas that's one thing that's that's like yeah we don't know what to do here's all
[3498.02 → 3504.08] the money to name your arena whatever it is uh tells world of science they bought it they own it
[3504.08 → 3511.84] what yeah so science world is uh is a dome in Vancouver that's really cool it's actually fantastic
[3511.84 → 3515.94] science world after dark is like one of the coolest great place to take the kids great place to even go
[3515.94 → 3520.70] on a date like they just have cool exhibits that are science and like puzzles you can do and
[3520.70 → 3525.94] they've done it before multiple times me too um so science world's fantastic so tell us actually they
[3525.94 → 3530.22] were running out of money because it was publicly funded, and you know it's like anything cool not
[3530.22 → 3537.98] enough people go because everyone's too busy playing video games um so I've been like five six times
[3537.98 → 3545.18] so tell us one of our local telcos just bought the thing just like okay whatever okay speaking of just
[3545.18 → 3550.26] buying the thing I guess it's time for our sponsor segment so we're gonna start with Dollar Shave Club
[3550.26 → 3560.18] oh no, no no, no I'm actually I'm actually I finally got why the banana exists I was like this is weird
[3560.18 → 3564.92] and I knew it was here like it was prepped to be here and like if you wanted to eat the freaking
[3564.92 → 3570.52] banana you could have eaten it before, so Dollar Shave Club sent us a second package because you can see
[3570.52 → 3575.14] that between me wasting all of our shave butter i actually really wish I hadn't wasted it is smells
[3575.14 → 3579.82] really nice, and it's like kind of nice to use so between me wasting all of our shave butter
[3579.82 → 3585.86] Tarzan stealing one of the razor handles and someone else taking off with a pack of blades
[3585.86 → 3592.88] I'm not even sure um they're not they're not in the box any more yeah maybe he asked you did he
[3592.88 → 3598.34] well I wasn't paying attention, so Dollar Shave Club sent us a new pack of it so we can show you I guess
[3598.34 → 3602.94] what the smaller follow-up packages look like once you sign up for the club but basically the way
[3602.94 → 3606.70] Dollar Shave Club works if you haven't heard of it before I'm just going to switch to our ah yes join
[3606.70 → 3611.48] the club visit dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus is what I really wanted to do was go to this one
[3611.48 → 3619.42] is you go ahead, and you sign up and the first time you get a handle you get some blades, and you get a
[3619.42 → 3624.40] pretty, pretty spectacular shave they have multiple products so they've got everything from like for
[3624.40 → 3629.88] okay so here to put this in perspective for six dollars and fifty cents you get a four blade razor
[3629.88 → 3635.38] um the last razor you'll ever need gentle shave single stroke their commercials fantastic and even
[3635.38 → 3639.46] their most expensive offering is under ten dollars you're looking at the Canadian site right now because
[3639.46 → 3644.06] I'm Canadian, and it automatically redirects me but in the U.S. the prices are actually slightly cheaper
[3644.06 → 3650.92] all they have to really say about themselves is look the blades are great they're a fraction of the
[3650.92 → 3655.72] cost of what you'll pay at the store, and you don't have to deal with the hassle of driving over to
[3655.72 → 3661.72] the store and dealing with you know fighting someone to open up the stupid compartment that
[3661.72 → 3666.08] contains the razor and going and getting the key I mean I don't know when the last time you tried to
[3666.08 → 3672.22] get service at a grocery store was but um there's nobody there sorry I don't think I've ever actually
[3672.22 → 3676.50] tried to get service at a grocery store in theory they have people like in the cosmetics department
[3676.50 → 3681.98] where normally you would find um cosmetics department I've seen people yeah so you can usually go get one
[3681.98 → 3688.80] of them to come and help you with the shaving supplies but like see this is the fact that I can
[3688.80 → 3695.32] tell this story at all addresses why the need for something like Dollar Shave Club exists where they
[3695.32 → 3700.28] deal with it for you every month you're going to get a new pack of blades so you can shave with a fresh
[3700.28 → 3704.54] razor every week you can also order their shave butter whenever you run out, and you can get their
[3704.54 → 3709.14] one wipe Charlies which are peppermint scented butt wipes for men, and they're I mean I'm not gonna I'm not
[3709.14 → 3713.32] going to sugarcoat this because trust me if you were to sugarcoat something that you wipe your butt with
[3713.32 → 3715.14] that granulation is not going to be cool
[3715.14 → 3721.42] anyway sorry I'm not going to sugarcoat this basically they're pre-moistened novelettes that
[3721.42 → 3727.50] smell nice and just to help in terms of effectiveness when you're trying to your know gather the troops
[3727.50 → 3736.02] so to speak and have them not smell when you're sitting next to people you know what my job isn't as
[3736.02 → 3741.32] easy as you might think it is I do it sometimes I know it's not that easy all I'm trying to say guys is
[3741.32 → 3746.72] head over to dollarshaveclub.com slash line to sign up for the club get a great shave every day and don't
[3746.72 → 3753.66] worry about the hassle of buying razors any more and I think that's all we have to say about that and are you
[3753.66 → 3764.36] really going to do this to me wow go along with your integration Linus all right, so thank you Asus for
[3764.36 → 3772.70] sponsoring the wan show we are proudly using the Asus g750 jay-z gaming notebook for all of our wan show
[3772.70 → 3778.72] needs and actually needs that go beyond the wan show since you messed up my last integration why don't
[3778.72 → 3783.36] you go ahead and talk about why you took the g750 jay-z which happens to belong to the company
[3783.36 → 3789.72] on a personal trip with you what was exactly the point of that well the the the point was that i
[3789.72 → 3796.42] had to test out a Terra note so I had a phone I had a Terra note and I had a laptop and part of my
[3796.42 → 3802.92] idea was if I needed to do something what did I go to grab so I needed a laptop that being said i I might
[3802.92 → 3810.52] own one um so basically you decided like oh well this one's pretty badass so even though I have my
[3810.52 → 3816.14] own laptop that i just I haven't even seen that in a while have you just junked it oh no I was using
[3816.14 → 3821.10] it for network diagnosis okay so you haven't just completely claimed this at this point although you
[3821.10 → 3826.36] basically tried you know what's funny is when we first found out we were getting these he didn't even
[3826.36 → 3831.18] know what the specs of the ones we were getting were like no idea I'm just like yeah we're getting new
[3831.18 → 3836.00] Asus gaming notebooks, and he's like oh uh we're getting them for wan show and I'm like yeah he's
[3836.00 → 3839.30] like oh well when we're done with wan show I can replace my desktop with it right I'm like
[3839.30 → 3845.30] ah it was a gaming level notebook I knew it was going to be faster than the desktop that I have which
[3845.30 → 3852.66] like I'm happy if it doesn't crash it's not even that bad it's got a quad-core yeah but like oh man
[3852.66 → 3860.42] okay so the point of the g750 jay-z it's not the lightest thing ever okay it's a little bit on the
[3860.42 → 3865.20] thicker side it's a little bit on the heavier side it's not an ultra book but the point of it
[3865.20 → 3870.86] is that it delivers pretty near a desktop grade experience out of a notebook something that is
[3870.86 → 3874.62] actually portable, and you know what I've actually observed like I've been running on battery for the
[3874.62 → 3882.52] entire show here and compared to my dell my XPS which ran out of battery in two hours and 55 minutes
[3882.52 → 3886.86] or something today I'm sitting with like three hours left of battery even though we've been streaming
[3886.86 → 3893.50] for over an hour now and I've been using it without with battery before the show so I mean i I like that
[3893.50 → 3897.84] the thing I like about a large notebook is that they can go ahead and put a big old battery in it
[3897.84 → 3902.66] and the fact that the GPU is not even on when you're just doing basic things with it means that
[3902.66 → 3907.04] you don't actually deal with that power loss you know that right yeah I know, but there's still
[3907.04 → 3912.02] technically it's a little bit it's not much these days it's not much yeah I forget what the features
[3912.02 → 3918.28] optimum right that's awkward I was like oh yeah I don't remember what that's called anymore but the
[3918.28 → 3924.04] point is that it comes with a GTX 880m which is about equivalent to a GTX 770 desktop GPU and it
[3924.04 → 3930.44] comes with a car i7 4700 HQ which is actually not really equivalent to anything um intel's desktop
[3930.44 → 3936.52] CPUs are faster but still in our testing we found that it kept up you know running bios hock infinite on
[3936.52 → 3941.88] ultra battlefield 4 and all that stuff with a pretty reasonable gaming desktop so yeah that's all we have to
[3941.88 → 3947.32] say about that thank-you Dollar Shave Club thank you for thanking you Asus for sponsoring the show
[3947.32 → 3952.44] remember guys if you want to join the club and get a great shave not like you, you've just stopped
[3952.44 → 3957.36] shaving entirely haven't you well my Dollar Shave Club razor had to be like borrowed for an integration
[3957.36 → 3962.92] and stuff and then oh that's why because I was saying because I knew at least two of them were
[3962.92 → 3967.68] missing and I was like oh one of the handles is back ew it has like stuff on it is that you and then
[3967.68 → 3972.34] I probably don't really want it back okay well I'll, I'll give you one back again because i
[3972.34 → 3977.72] specifically asked them for a new one I'm going to a birthday party on Saturday night so I'm gonna
[3977.72 → 3985.20] have to grind my face with my no I'll razor take the razor jeez killing me here anyway guys
[3985.20 → 3990.18] you can sign up at Dollar Shave Club.com slash Linus and for the g750 jay-z I think you guys know where
[3990.18 → 3999.08] to buy notebooks there are lots of places to buy notebooks like um the notebook.com is that no
[3999.08 → 4004.20] that's probably not a thing I actually don't know that's probably for the movie yeah I would think so
[4004.20 → 4008.90] let's see all right so we're going to go ahead and have a look at whether people would be excited to
[4008.90 → 4014.66] see an apple slash beats co-developed product the uh overwhelming majority of you say no or maybe
[4014.66 → 4021.60] and the underwhelming that's a pretty flat vote the underwhelming minority of you say yes but then
[4021.60 → 4029.52] yeah so for most of you zero cares were given okay I get it but I will objectively evaluate anything
[4029.52 → 4034.56] that comes out of that partnership before the show was on he asked me about it and I said i
[4034.56 → 4038.86] just can't really bring myself to care very much, and he's like well you should probably blah blah blah
[4038.86 → 4044.12] I was like yeah, but it's from two companies that I'm not ever going to buy anything from you will
[4044.12 → 4049.76] never buy anything from apple probably not what if the I watch is fantastic but then I'd have to
[4049.76 → 4056.94] get that whole ecosystem that's how apple works really yeah it would have to be really legendary
[4056.94 → 4061.72] what if the iPhone 6 is fantastic it could be but if you look at the trending every single time that
[4061.72 → 4070.58] jobs goes away every single he went away once twice well he died yeah really that's twice you're
[4070.58 → 4078.16] going to bring up jobs is death I tried to do it lightly I tried to do it really lightly actually
[4078.16 → 4087.10] just didn't work at all right so semantics VP says antivirus is dead this was posted on the
[4087.10 → 4093.52] forum by nice hat along with some very amusing pictures this one's fantastic if you guys can't
[4093.52 → 4099.48] read if it's an anonymous Facebook post my computer's being really slow I forgot it had a virus I'm just
[4099.48 → 4107.12] going to shut it down and stop using it until it goes away text me, and then it's just the most appropriate
[4107.12 → 4113.20] use of this guy yeah that I think I have ever seen yeah probably me to that's a perfect picture
[4113.20 → 4120.54] that's fantastic, and you know it would, it would be funnier if uh is we didn't know people like that
[4120.54 → 4126.58] oh yeah yeah but I think we all do so what's your take on this is antivirus well okay first we
[4126.58 → 4131.86] should probably so basically uh what Brian die says, so this is senior vice senior VP of information
[4131.86 → 4137.10] securities we don't think of antivirus as a moneymaker anymore and that he points out that hackers
[4137.10 → 4145.76] are increasingly using novel bugs as ways to gain control of a system or um gain
[4145.76 → 4150.46] information or whatever else it is that they're trying to do as opposed to straighten up computer
[4150.46 → 4157.02] viruses and Mr die estimates that antivirus now catches just 45 percent of cyberattacks I mean
[4157.02 → 4163.80] we've known for quite some time that spyware or adware were actually larger issues than traditional
[4163.80 → 4170.70] viruses but i I guess I've just never heard it from someone at a company like semantic there's another
[4170.70 → 4175.52] thing though like one I think one of the big problems here is where he actually says it we don't see it as a
[4175.52 → 4182.12] moneymaker in any way and I think that stands out more than anything because almost everyone I know
[4182.12 → 4185.68] in the tech industry not everyone but almost everyone I know in the tech industry is running
[4185.68 → 4192.38] a combination of antivirus software the same one almost everybody they run windows stock I don't
[4192.38 → 4198.78] even remember windows whatever windows not defender security essentials yeah Microsoft security
[4198.78 → 4203.18] essentials MSE there we go Microsoft security essentials for passive scanning of viruses because
[4203.18 → 4206.86] there's a big difference between when it's just running constantly looking for things and when
[4206.86 → 4211.48] you manually run it huge difference so I see most people that I know are running that for kind of
[4211.48 → 4215.88] passive scanning and then once every one or once in a while this is a perfect idea for a straw poll
[4215.88 → 4222.10] once every once in a while they will download and run bam or malware bytes and then run it for
[4222.10 → 4228.14] its active scan the manual one remove everything that it catches and then just uninstall it none of that
[4228.14 → 4234.62] costs any money and the majority of people that I know that even run antiviruses are doing that combo
[4234.62 → 4241.56] or just MSE Microsoft security essentials not even the bam once in a while um so I can totally see
[4241.56 → 4247.28] where they're talking about it not being a moneymaker um I'm surprised they're taking the stance they
[4247.28 → 4252.38] are we're going like with the fake data and all that kind of stuff considering that already exists
[4252.38 → 4258.14] with honey pots like the I don't see them proposing anything that's really new these are all things
[4258.14 → 4263.80] that already exist so I find that a little bit interesting um and I don't think antivirus is
[4263.80 → 4268.12] unimportant I think it might be unimportant to certain people yeah for the random average Joe it's
[4268.12 → 4271.58] probably fine if you just pay attention to what you're searching you don't click on anything super
[4271.58 → 4275.14] stupid maybe you've been around on the internet for a really long time, and you're perfect at
[4275.14 → 4280.12] identifying download now buttons at this point, and you can read the URL at the bottom of your browser
[4280.12 → 4283.00] when you're highlighting buttons to make sure you're not going to some ad, and you're actually
[4283.00 → 4287.16] downloading what you want um and stuff like that maybe you're good with that and you kind of either
[4287.16 → 4291.94] run MSE or nothing and that's fine you're probably okay but at the corporate level I think it still
[4291.94 → 4296.48] really matters um when if someone gets into your network and deletes everything on your server it's
[4296.48 → 4302.48] catastrophic um I've done it work for some law firms way back in the day I don't do it anymore
[4302.48 → 4309.74] um, but it was I thought you still did I do but I'm kind of just like outside support right okay and
[4309.74 → 4314.06] like if they have a question they'll email me, but everything's automated now that I don't I used to
[4314.06 → 4318.94] go in there all the time because it was more like I was taking over for someone else so I had to do a
[4318.94 → 4323.42] lot of stuff right, and now it's more just like if they have a problem they'll call me in every once in
[4323.42 → 4327.74] a while like every few months I'll go in for a while and like make sure everything's good like I'll go in
[4327.74 → 4332.50] for a whole Saturday right, but it's not super common any more so sorry you were talking about how you were
[4332.50 → 4338.64] doing yeah so that them huge huge deal they do a thing where I have it where one of their
[4338.64 → 4343.52] employees that's somewhat tech-savvy walks in and plugs in a cable once every week, and it does a big
[4343.52 → 4348.60] backup to a computer plugs in one cable unplugs another cable so it does a big backup to an
[4348.60 → 4353.96] offline server that's almost always offline so it's it could still get infected because you are plugging
[4353.96 → 4358.16] into a computer that is normally online right, but it's probably not going to happen to the point
[4358.16 → 4363.46] where everything's going to be deleted right or if it is, they have two servers and like they're
[4363.46 → 4366.80] both running different operating systems like there 's's a bunch of layers of security
[4366.80 → 4371.16] that's a huge deal because if they lose everything they're screwed right they also have
[4371.16 → 4376.22] off-site backups they have like multiple layers of security so that to be able to take them down
[4376.22 → 4382.54] you'd have to take down an off-site backup that's in the states two things on site like Dropbox style
[4382.54 → 4387.62] not actually Dropbox but drop stop Dropbox style backups like all this kind of stuff it's not going
[4387.62 → 4393.02] to happen that's important um, and then they run antivirus all over the place because it's important
[4393.02 → 4397.48] because their data is super important right is someone being able to see that I have 800 hours
[4397.48 → 4403.28] on borrowing super important probably not right okay I think it depends who you are well it looks
[4403.28 → 4410.50] like actually our users are pretty um pretty, pretty safe they practice safe internet browsing
[4410.50 → 4417.52] so 30 percent of you are using real-time scanning and doing periodic cleanups with three are about 12
[4417.52 → 4421.82] percent of you doing periodic cleanups only about the same number doing real-time scanning only and
[4421.82 → 4427.86] about 11 percent of you using no antivirus with the majority of the respondents or at least more
[4427.86 → 4434.60] than any of the other replies uh asking me to eat more bananas it was hot um unfortunately since a
[4434.60 → 4441.48] banana isn't a real thing I really can't do that so i I well I appreciate the uh I appreciate the
[4441.48 → 4451.32] thought though that was great you guys are great okay, so intel's sky lake there have been some
[4451.32 → 4457.56] leaked documental relations this was posted on the forum by QWERTY warrior the original article is
[4457.56 → 4466.12] from tech power up and um basically it's 100 series it's going to be coming with ddr4 support it's going
[4466.12 → 4473.24] to be 14 nanometre processors, and it's going to feature alpine ridge thunderbolt running at 40 gigabit
[4473.24 → 4480.62] per second man that's fast I'm kind of surprised they're jumping into 100 series I see a lot of
[4480.62 → 4487.56] companies when they get to the top they just reset okay, okay yeah I don't really mind it's just I'm
[4487.56 → 4493.22] saying I'm just kind of surprised I mean AMD switched over to an x, but then intel already has x whatever
[4493.22 → 4501.68] so yeah what you going to do painted yourselves into that corner didn't you so basically compared to uh
[4501.68 → 4507.98] compared to uh haswell refresh and Bradwell and to be clear guys Haswell refresh is not a
[4507.98 → 4516.22] significant change over Haswell it's just like slightly faster um sat express has been added uh if
[4516.22 → 4522.96] you if you take the the the heat sink off of a z97 board it says z87 rev2 on it like it's not a big
[4522.96 → 4529.92] deal but uh Bradwell is going to be a small generational change or uh rather that'll
[4529.92 → 4535.02] be a significant generational change in terms of the manufacturing process and then beyond that that's
[4535.02 → 4541.18] when we're getting a new architecture so that'll be sky lake and that's coming in 2015 I'm actually
[4541.18 → 4547.08] curious to see when Bradwell is going to arrive I guess that could be coming very soon than huh
[4547.08 → 4551.84] I don't know intel doesn't really tell me anything they just sort of like stuff arrives and I'm like
[4551.84 → 4557.64] yay cool um let's let's like let's like check it out so it's going to have a bunch of really cool
[4557.64 → 4562.96] stuff so they're going to have much improved wireless they're going to have much improved thunderbolt
[4562.96 → 4570.80] and they are also going to have hopefully much improved CPUs, so this whole roadmap has been leaked
[4570.80 → 4577.14] I guess that's really all I have to say about that isn't it yeah there's honestly there isn't a ton
[4577.14 → 4583.50] of information right now yeah so yeah take that and do whatever you want 2015 is exciting you know
[4583.50 → 4591.14] yeah even if it's late 2015 I guess if we got like a very late 2014 Bradwell then a late 2015 skylight
[4591.14 → 4595.96] could make sense yep and that's uh that's actually pretty in line with some of the estimates we saw
[4595.96 → 4600.76] on that thunderbolt 40 gigabits per second article that came out a little while ago how that makes sense
[4600.76 → 4605.74] yeah, so the timing is probably about right now I think we should straw poll this because something
[4605.74 → 4610.82] that you talked about before the show uh that had to do with Karachi the next article you're doing i
[4610.82 → 4617.96] want to see why people care or maybe uh twitter blitz yeah okay so um there was a
[4617.96 → 4624.10] so this was posted on the forum by top war gamer thank you very much for that CEO bobby choice has
[4624.10 → 4630.56] revealed that Activision is spending 500 million to try and make destiny a hit that's half a
[4630.56 → 4638.26] billion dollars which is a little less than double the unprecedented over quarter billion dollars
[4638.26 → 4645.22] that rock star paid to get GTA 5 made um there I saw quite a few people attacking the article saying
[4645.22 → 4651.74] that because it's on Kodak it's therefore uh completely not credible and completely stupid
[4651.74 → 4657.42] but I would like to hear from I would like to hear from our users maybe uh I'll create a straw poll
[4657.42 → 4665.16] here pretty quick here guys and then uh is Kodak because honestly a lot of the stuff I've read on
[4665.16 → 4669.26] there like no one's right 100 of the time but a lot of the stuff I've read on there has turned out to
[4669.26 → 4675.58] be perfectly fine i i I have no idea it's possible that we missed something yeah like that's totally
[4675.58 → 4682.18] possible like was there a huge controversy like that whole I don't know uh what was it LA Times tesla
[4682.18 → 4687.24] review thing I think it was the LA Times tesla review Washington Post talking about oculus Washington
[4687.24 → 4692.18] post tesla review well uh I'm not sure if there was someone I think it might have been more than one
[4692.18 → 4699.86] group actually for tesla uh New York times sorry it was New York times uh they eventually apologized for
[4699.86 → 4704.88] that and all that noise so yeah so maybe they maybe Kodak has done some stuff that neither of us is aware
[4704.88 → 4710.34] of yeah for sure yes no what's Kodak
[4710.34 → 4720.56] okay so I'm going to go ahead and allow multiple choices if you're going to have that on the poll
[4720.56 → 4727.60] no people have to pick one it's just going to be skewed now can you imagine if like political elections
[4727.60 → 4733.40] had multiple choices I would actually be more incentivized to vote me too actually because if i
[4733.40 → 4737.90] could just say I don't care they should have multiple choices they should have multiple choices
[4737.90 → 4742.18] because you could be like I don't care, but these like any one of these is okay because
[4742.18 → 4747.16] then you wouldn't have to worry about the vote getting split between and then that would probably
[4747.16 → 4751.08] help the whole two-party system thing anyway we probably shouldn't talk about politics yeah we
[4751.08 → 4754.34] probably shouldn't talk about politics I'm sure there's a good reason that uh we don't allow
[4754.34 → 4755.20] multiple choice
[4755.20 → 4762.54] yeah I actually can't think of one maybe it's because like the real flaw
[4762.54 → 4767.68] in a multiple choice test for example is that someone can just guess and still get a passing
[4767.68 → 4775.26] grade whereas on a political on an election ballot there's no right answer so it's inherently flawed
[4775.26 → 4780.92] multiple choice doesn't address that by giving us a possibility to get it right maybe that's the issue
[4780.92 → 4786.06] what I'm just I'm just like that doesn't make any sense
[4786.06 → 4798.60] it's called when show not when's show weekly analysis news and sense
[4798.60 → 4806.64] I think with analysis people kind of assume that there's going to be some amount of sense they could but
[4806.64 → 4811.78] they'd be I mean look at they're voting for bananas that's because you didn't put multiple
[4811.78 → 4816.28] choice on this poll I don't have you put a course I don't have to put anything on my poll
[4816.28 → 4820.12] I don't have to put anything on my poll that I don't want to
[4820.12 → 4825.68] wow let me make the polls
[4825.68 → 4836.04] are you making a poll right now maybe no one will know they can't see my screen or what's behind my
[4836.04 → 4846.96] screen this show is the best this show speaking of things that are the best this is fantastic
[4846.96 → 4857.36] fantastic posted on the forum originally by uh l3 MO back black Moses that makes more sense
[4857.36 → 4864.98] posted originally on the forum by black Moses the smartest protest ever what do we get the smartest
[4864.98 → 4872.44] protest ever yeah am I in the wrong section right now no, no fast lunches drivers I thought we were in
[4872.44 → 4877.66] a different thing we're talking about net neutrality yeah, but there's a total okay anyway there's two
[4877.66 → 4881.74] topics about net neutrality I thought you entered that one I thought you're talking about this one
[4881.74 → 4885.68] yeah that is the one I was talking about where did that go oh that looked at the wrong article
[4885.68 → 4891.40] that's why I was like what okay this makes more sense okay so back to this okay go
[4891.40 → 4897.56] okay so what they're doing is well this web host and i think there's now a GitHub
[4897.56 → 4901.36] that has the code for it, so other people can implement it all this kind of stuff um but what
[4901.36 → 4904.64] they're doing is they're making it so that different IPS that access their website that
[4904.64 → 4913.56] are from the FCC are getting incredibly slow traffic so like 28.8 dial up not even the fastest dial up
[4913.56 → 4918.64] that we had no crappy dial up yeah so like if you try and if the FCC tries to access their website it'll
[4918.64 → 4923.92] go that slow um I think it's kind of cool, and it's clever but I don't think it's gonna matter unless
[4923.92 → 4928.12] like Google does if it's well it's not gonna matter unless Google does it, but it's not really
[4928.12 → 4934.06] the point is I get it, and it's cool, and it does drive a point, and it's very interesting so
[4934.06 → 4939.30] it's its we've got the French plan or Frankie I can never remember I'm not a Star Trek guy the
[4939.30 → 4945.42] French plan is a special FCC only internet plan that costs a thousand dollars per year and removes
[4945.42 → 4950.92] the 28.8 kilobit per second modem throttle to the FCC we will happily take credit cards bitcoin Dogecoin
[4950.92 → 4955.76] and Dogecoin from crooked FCC executives that probably have plenty of money from bribes on
[4955.76 → 4960.58] our donations page sorry we don't accept adding them yet so though they obviously the whole thing
[4960.58 → 4966.74] is just purely a joke, but the point is that net neutrality is important because it will prevent
[4966.74 → 4973.64] situations where an ISP can hold your internet connection or you're the speed with which you can
[4973.64 → 4978.54] connect to certain services ransom unless you're willing to pay them more money for it and the problem
[4978.54 → 4985.54] with them holding let's say let's say I'm I'm Luke's internet service provider and I go
[4985.54 → 4991.66] you know what Luke I probably don't like you uh Canada you all suck well whatever man you're stuck
[4991.66 → 4996.24] here what are you going to do leave canada is great for all kinds of other reasons you can deal
[4996.24 → 5001.54] with crappy internet okay so look dude you play a lot of games you watch a lot of twitch streams twitch
[5001.54 → 5006.64] streams man they use a lot of bandwidth that means we have to go buy like switches and crap and like
[5006.64 → 5010.96] you know those switches are really expensive look don't worry about that those switches are really
[5010.96 → 5016.72] expensive so we need you to give us some money to you know justify another football stadium because
[5016.72 → 5021.22] you're because you're a heavy user okay you're putting more of a load on your fat you're putting
[5021.22 → 5027.48] more of a load on our system that's a fat joke than the other users okay, so the problem is that then
[5027.48 → 5033.06] Mr ISP gets to extract a bunch of money from him because you go okay look if you want to access twitch fast
[5033.06 → 5038.34] we can give you like a fast lane for that because otherwise in the background I could be slowing down
[5038.34 → 5044.00] his twitch stream, and we see this all the time you can go do a speed test tomorrow, and it'll have like
[5044.00 → 5047.82] a great speed, and then you go and try to load a YouTube video or watch a movie on Netflix, and you've
[5047.82 → 5053.26] got this degraded internet experience so I'm I'm telling Mr user I'm like look okay yeah you want fast
[5053.26 → 5057.98] twitch yeah sure no problem man just give us a couple more bucks and then I'm going to turn around and I'm
[5057.98 → 5062.42] going to tell twitch hey you guys are putting a bunch of load on our network with all of our users
[5062.42 → 5067.22] downloading your streams you've got to give us money to and so all of a sudden we create the
[5067.22 → 5072.46] situation where the ISPS can double-dip and just take additional money to build infrastructure that
[5072.46 → 5076.68] they should have built in the first place which they got paid to build in the first place if you're
[5076.68 → 5083.28] in the states and two which they don't need they're so baller when it's at the point where like
[5083.28 → 5088.08] the only people that are buying these stupid investments which is putting your name in front of a
[5088.08 → 5095.06] sports stadium they're all ISPS or like cell providers are you kidding me it's because they're
[5095.06 → 5102.46] just rolling in money it's super dumb they don't need any more money anyway I do like the protest
[5102.46 → 5107.62] though I think it's pretty cool I think it's fantastic I think it really makes a point to people who
[5107.62 → 5114.16] maybe just don't care enough maybe they just don't care enough to look into it like I mean
[5114.16 → 5121.18] you know what let's all be honest with ourselves do you do a hundred percent the best job you possibly
[5121.18 → 5128.74] can at work every day do you do one hundred percent of the due diligence maybe a few of you do some of
[5128.74 → 5135.56] you probably don't I'm not asking you the point I'm not even creating a poll for this I'm just I'm
[5135.56 → 5141.96] just asking you guys to ask yourselves you know do you do whether your job is to dig ditches or to cook
[5141.96 → 5148.22] food or to serve food or to make internet videos or to drive a truck or whatever your job is there's
[5148.22 → 5156.04] thousands and thousands of jobs do you do it the best every day maybe not so maybe what we're
[5156.04 → 5160.26] what we just need to do is we need to wake up someone who's been asleep at the wheel a little
[5160.26 → 5165.18] bit and go hey can you create some havoc internally over there and like get some attention around this
[5165.18 → 5170.30] and this is the kind of protest that does more than just create noise because emails are easy
[5170.30 → 5176.02] to ignore Facebook polls or protests or whatever you just ignore that crap because it's just stupid
[5176.02 → 5182.36] it does it's not relevant whereas when someone goes to access the internet, and it's slow, and they go oh
[5182.36 → 5188.22] why is it slow you're starting the the the inquisitive process I was going to say inquisition
[5188.22 → 5193.04] that's not right you're starting the inquisitive process you're getting them wondering what's going on
[5193.04 → 5196.56] and once they understand what's going on hey well someone's slowing down my internet why are they
[5196.56 → 5201.76] doing that my internet should be fast right, and then we can hope that the light bulb turns on so i
[5201.76 → 5205.16] really I thought this was a really effective way to get that point across and I hope it works yeah
[5205.16 → 5211.18] no it is really cool actually um oh I wasn't even aware of this is interesting uh there's
[5211.18 → 5219.10] apparently some new graphics card coming power colour oh yeah has a new devil 13 this one has um no
[5219.10 → 5224.00] post by brown ninja so I'm sure it'll be in the post somewhere um, but it has like the Nemo fin
[5224.00 → 5230.06] thing where the fan has the little fins in there is this that one let's go see yeah see the little
[5230.06 → 5235.34] tiny fins on the inside it also has four eight pin power connections four eight you'll see if you
[5235.34 → 5240.50] keep on going down there's the yeah I knew it'd be in here somewhere there boom look at that boom
[5240.50 → 5248.68] it's just a monstrous card so they ditched the whole AI o idea hair cooler yeah air cooled rather
[5248.68 → 5254.82] wow four eight triple slot four eight pins what the heck the thing is ridiculous only three of those
[5254.82 → 5259.82] four are required so if you want a little bit of extra overclocking headroom you can plug in the fourth
[5259.82 → 5268.64] and wow look at the backplate I like if it's actually pretty cool yeah it looks badass yeah double 13
[5268.64 → 5273.84] huh someone in the comments somewhere on here I don't remember where it was
[5273.84 → 5280.46] was like so one eight pin for the GPU and then one for each fan for each
[5280.46 → 5286.78] can't remember exactly how he said it, but it was awesome them Nemo fans when you got little fins like
[5286.78 → 5290.84] that you have to like work pretty hard it takes a full eight pins for each one of those fans guys
[5290.84 → 5298.24] yeah get it right Geez yeah that's kind of awesome should we get jump into bill logs um yeah sure i
[5298.24 → 5303.06] think that's pretty much it I think I'm I'm pretty much done for the week so here we go we have
[5303.06 → 5308.70] something really special after bill logs guys so do we yeah we do I know about it, I told you
[5308.70 → 5315.10] before the show that doesn't mean I know, so the first one is dope do I have office on here I hope so
[5315.10 → 5323.10] I hope so too it looks fine oh I have some kind of office oh I want to try it for a limited time
[5323.10 → 5323.60] oh
[5323.60 → 5334.80] not good it looks fine though I think wow all the tabs no one can see what's going on hey everyone
[5334.80 → 5343.76] hey guys sorry where did it go it's here wow I'm tired there we go well it looks okay
[5343.76 → 5350.96] view either way every single time we do the bill logs every single bill log I talk about I'm like you
[5350.96 → 5354.94] should probably just go check it out the forum so you can see everything so do that again check out
[5354.94 → 5358.58] these guys full bill logs really have tons of pictures you can see everything about it, you can
[5358.58 → 5362.40] go to the voting thread and see everyone who submitted there are some guys that submitted that
[5362.40 → 5367.78] had really nice builds um the thing with having bill logs per the week is there isn't enough and
[5367.78 → 5371.60] the thing with having bill logs per the month is there are a lot of really awesome ones and they
[5371.60 → 5375.44] don't all get through so be sure to check out the voting thread because wow you can see
[5375.44 → 5382.62] everything this build is spotless the hard tubing really, really popular thing lately and I'm
[5382.62 → 5390.50] okay with that that looks fantastic yeah very cool absolutely beautiful but I well, well this one is
[5390.50 → 5396.04] really nice and very clean I personally appreciate the next one a little bit more you know I haven't
[5396.04 → 5402.00] seen many great builds in the 900d now that I think about if it's like yeah it's big, and it's like
[5402.00 → 5406.30] liquid cooling optimized, but it almost seems like corsair took the challenge out of it a little
[5406.30 → 5411.68] bit for people by making it too easy to do a great build in so I think a lot of people were turned off
[5411.68 → 5417.72] by that that's just my perception it's also huge and really heavy yeah but uh this one
[5417.72 → 5428.22] oh sorry sorry sorry, so this one is portal cube by Jill yeah I don't know look at that that's fantastic
[5428.22 → 5434.12] it looks better if you see it not on the stream and not like converted not in like 16 colour mode
[5434.12 → 5440.02] yeah um, so there's uh there's a power supply on the bottom there's it there, and then you can go
[5440.02 → 5444.72] ahead and check out all the different photos of it so we should probably post a link to the build
[5444.72 → 5449.24] log section I'm just going to track that down or if you want to I can go grab that if you jump on the
[5449.24 → 5453.60] next one on your screen I'll post the thing in the chat sure work on that we've got an honourable mention
[5453.60 → 5461.26] here guys project affinity do you remember now nope this is the computer that people I believe built
[5461.26 → 5468.50] and distributed to linos oh cool yeah so a bunch of people on the forum I think it's a main people
[5468.50 → 5474.52] from the um unofficial team speak yeah all got together built this computer got him a bunch
[5474.52 → 5480.28] of games this is a list of games that he got wow that's more games than I own no well it's more
[5480.28 → 5488.28] games than I play yes that is true and like nice ones to battlefield 4 star citizen like
[5488.28 → 5493.06] big not just like oh we bought a humble indie bundle like this oh my god they got them secret
[5493.06 → 5497.40] of the magic crystals that's a game about ponies um well yeah it is linos
[5497.40 → 5509.78] so over 10 community members contributed and this is just a really cool a really cool example of the
[5509.78 → 5514.40] community coming together and supporting each other I mean if you guys aren't already members
[5514.40 → 5521.94] of the limbs tech tips dot com forum you probably should be I mean this is just a small subset of
[5521.94 → 5528.24] like the super cool guys and gals that make up the community here so you know we uh we appreciate
[5528.24 → 5533.74] everyone just being part of it, and we think it's really, really awesome so I think uh that's probably
[5533.74 → 5537.34] all I have to say about that yeah what's up with this stuff I'm not going to do these today
[5537.34 → 5544.64] oh i this is a company bonito that uh they asked if I wanted to review the bonito pop and or
[5544.64 → 5550.24] the bonito classic these are some smartwatches that I think actually um are pretty unique in that
[5550.24 → 5557.10] particularly the pop tries to make the smart watchless like by design it's not that smart
[5557.10 → 5563.76] so instead of having a screen it's its just an analog watch instead of having a screen that's like
[5563.76 → 5567.54] blah blah blah read your text messages reply to your text messages talking to your wrist
[5567.54 → 5574.42] um it just flashes hey that notification you got was uh text, or it was an email, or it was an instant
[5574.42 → 5580.56] messaging thing, and it just tells you sort of what kind of notification it was and then the classic
[5580.56 → 5586.24] has an analog face, and then it actually does go into a little bit more detail in terms of what types
[5586.24 → 5590.74] of messages you got so it gives you battery indication, and then you can read your messages on it as
[5590.74 → 5595.54] well, and it actually looks quite nice so I was like okay well I can't promise a review because I've
[5595.54 → 5599.88] never heard of you before and I don't know if it's any good, but you know if it's fantastic I'll do
[5599.88 → 5603.38] a review and what I'll definitely do is try out the products and I'll talk about them on the wan show
[5603.38 → 5607.80] so that's going to be coming sometime in the next week or two all right I think that's about it
