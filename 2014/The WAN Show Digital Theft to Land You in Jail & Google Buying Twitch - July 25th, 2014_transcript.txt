[0.00 --> 4.00]  We should just change our starting time to 4.35.
[4.00 --> 7.00]  Never mind that that's a completely awkward time to start the show.
[7.00 --> 10.00]  The problem is, if we do that, we'll go live at 4.40.
[10.00 --> 13.00]  I guess that's true. It's just...
[13.00 --> 15.00]  It's something about you.
[15.00 --> 16.00]  We're fashionably late.
[16.00 --> 17.00]  Fashionably late.
[17.00 --> 18.00]  Why is it something about me?
[18.00 --> 21.00]  Well, I mean, with you, everything seems to be about you.
[21.00 --> 23.00]  You're a very self-centered person.
[23.00 --> 27.00]  Speaking of which, I guess we're on the Linus Tech Tips show!
[27.00 --> 30.00]  Hosted by Linus Media Group.
[30.00 --> 32.00]  Featuring the Linus Tech Tips forum.
[32.00 --> 34.00]  Are you implying that I'm projecting?
[34.00 --> 36.00]  No. I'm not implying anything.
[36.00 --> 41.00]  Because I think you have a very suspicious disposition and you always throw accusations around.
[44.00 --> 45.00]  It's all about that.
[45.00 --> 50.00]  Alright, speaking of projecting, Google is projected...
[52.00 --> 54.00]  It kind of worked.
[54.00 --> 55.00]  Not really.
[55.00 --> 62.00]  The rumor on the street is that Google has basically reached a deal to buy Twitch for a billion dollars.
[62.00 --> 65.00]  That's the video streaming site that we are streaming on right now.
[65.00 --> 66.00]  This was rumored a while back.
[66.00 --> 67.00]  Yeah, exactly.
[67.00 --> 72.00]  This was rumored a while back, but never actually confirmed.
[72.00 --> 77.00]  And even though a lot of places are reporting that it's a done deal, it still is...
[77.00 --> 78.00]  We're not actually doing the topic.
[78.00 --> 79.00]  We're not actually doing the topic.
[79.00 --> 80.00]  No.
[80.00 --> 81.00]  I'm doing call-outs.
[81.00 --> 82.00]  Right, so that's a thing.
[82.00 --> 88.00]  Also, Ubisoft plans to send a fan to Mount Everest to play Far Cry 4.
[89.00 --> 90.00]  Copy us much?
[90.00 --> 91.00]  Yeah, seriously.
[91.00 --> 92.00]  Right?
[92.00 --> 93.00]  Am I right?
[93.00 --> 94.00]  Yeah.
[94.00 --> 95.00]  What else we got?
[95.00 --> 98.00]  Microsoft is planning on merging all of their versions of Windows into one.
[98.00 --> 100.00]  Just in case you didn't know that was happening.
[100.00 --> 101.00]  We'll talk about that later.
[101.00 --> 102.00]  I should call it Uber Edition.
[103.00 --> 105.00]  We should call it Barnaclea's Edition.
[105.00 --> 107.00]  And it should have like, tears on the box.
[107.00 --> 110.00]  Speaking of which, our guest today is Barnaclea's.
[110.00 --> 111.00]  Barnaclea's.
[112.00 --> 113.00]  Correct.
[114.00 --> 120.00]  A British MP wants to punish people for stealing in-game items with real-world punishments like jail.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Kind of a big deal.
[122.00 --> 123.00]  And intro.
[123.00 --> 125.00]  The in-game punishments weren't working.
[125.00 --> 128.00]  Like calling them buttholes in the chat.
[128.00 --> 129.00]  You're a jerk.
[130.00 --> 131.00]  Go away.
[132.00 --> 133.00]  Please stop.
[133.00 --> 135.00]  My mom says to ignore comments from you.
[139.00 --> 141.00]  Oh, there we go.
[150.00 --> 151.00]  Okay.
[151.00 --> 169.00]  Well, if someone didn't have their paws all over my mouse, I'd be able to tell you that today's sponsor is Lynda.com.
[170.00 --> 176.00]  The great, fantastic, awesome, exceptional, wonderful place to learn online with videos.
[176.00 --> 177.00]  I mean, aside from our channel.
[177.00 --> 180.00]  You can learn all kinds of things on Lynda.com that we don't cover.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  So I don't really consider them a competitor, you know?
[182.00 --> 192.00]  I don't really consider it a conflict of interest for me to sponsor them, just like they don't consider it a conflict for me to make an educational video about something and then promote their educational videos.
[193.00 --> 195.00]  Maybe we should turn this into a bitter rivalry.
[196.00 --> 198.00]  We should make, speaking of self-centered, we should make Linus.com.
[199.00 --> 200.00]  Lynda versus Linus.com.
[200.00 --> 201.00]  Oh, God.
[202.00 --> 203.00]  Linus.com.
[203.00 --> 207.00]  And then we need like a picture of me being like, looking into a book.
[208.00 --> 209.00]  But very...
[209.00 --> 210.00]  Angry.
[210.00 --> 211.00]  Or like serious.
[211.00 --> 213.00]  I'm looking at this with the most neutral tone possible.
[214.00 --> 215.00]  Yeah.
[215.00 --> 217.00]  Our other sponsor is actually Intel.
[217.00 --> 226.00]  They're going to have a pretty cool presence at Nerd HQ involving giving money away to charities and giving processors away to cool people like you.
[227.00 --> 228.00]  And...
[228.00 --> 229.00]  Yay.
[229.00 --> 230.00]  So we'll tell you more about that.
[230.00 --> 231.00]  Really?
[231.00 --> 232.00]  How to win a processor.
[232.00 --> 237.00]  How to make Intel give a dollar to a pretty awesome charity.
[237.00 --> 238.00]  So we'll cover that later on.
[238.00 --> 239.00]  What can I do for you?
[239.00 --> 243.00]  I told you there would be people in the chat wondering why I was here because I quit.
[244.00 --> 245.00]  Really?
[246.00 --> 247.00]  Really?
[248.00 --> 249.00]  Okay.
[249.00 --> 250.00]  Let's be clear.
[250.00 --> 251.00]  So in a recent video...
[252.00 --> 253.00]  I think most of them are joking.
[253.00 --> 257.00]  In the H220X video, okay, I asked...
[258.00 --> 261.00]  Okay, a couple things happened that were real and a couple things happened that weren't real.
[261.00 --> 264.00]  The things that were real were that the H220X is pretty kick-ass.
[264.00 --> 266.00]  It performs really well.
[266.00 --> 267.00]  It's expandable.
[267.00 --> 268.00]  It's quiet.
[269.00 --> 270.00]  Kick-ass product.
[270.00 --> 271.00]  Great value.
[271.00 --> 278.00]  Another thing that was real, I did indeed ask Luke to shave parts of me that I couldn't reach on my own.
[279.00 --> 284.00]  But I mean, the thing about that is that really what I was talking about was my back.
[285.00 --> 290.00]  I mean, the coin purse isn't exactly an issue as long as there's some stretchiness to the skin.
[290.00 --> 293.00]  You can kind of maneuver it the way that you need to.
[293.00 --> 298.00]  Have you seen that video where the guys are like, and they have to shave?
[298.00 --> 299.00]  It's a YouTube commercial thing.
[300.00 --> 303.00]  It shows all the weird things that guys do to their face so they can shave properly.
[303.00 --> 304.00]  Right, yes.
[304.00 --> 305.00]  And they're all like, ugh.
[305.00 --> 307.00]  And they're trying to flatten out their face so they can shave properly.
[307.00 --> 308.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[308.00 --> 310.00]  It's like, they should have a non-safe for work commercial version of that.
[311.00 --> 313.00]  I wonder if they make more money.
[313.00 --> 316.00]  You gotta be careful saying things like, they should have.
[317.00 --> 319.00]  They shouldn't have, but it would be funny.
[319.00 --> 320.00]  But it would be funny.
[320.00 --> 321.00]  But it would be funny.
[321.00 --> 325.00]  So I fired Luke for refusing to do that.
[325.00 --> 326.00]  That part wasn't real.
[326.00 --> 327.00]  He did not get fired.
[327.00 --> 331.00]  It would be fun if you did that though, because then I could make tons of money in the legal system.
[331.00 --> 332.00]  Tons of money.
[332.00 --> 336.00]  You know I don't have enough money for it to be tons of money.
[336.00 --> 337.00]  Yeah.
[337.00 --> 338.00]  I would run out of money.
[338.00 --> 340.00]  And then how would you feel?
[340.00 --> 342.00]  I can take your totally doesn't exist at all Lambo.
[342.00 --> 343.00]  Yeah, exactly.
[343.00 --> 346.00]  Which would be great, because it doesn't exist at all.
[346.00 --> 354.00]  You could, you could like, depending on how long you could hold a chair position with your hands in front of you like this, you could drive down the street in the imaginary Lambo.
[354.00 --> 358.00]  It's like, get a shuffle foot thing going.
[358.00 --> 365.00]  Speaking of imaginary and, and employees screwing over their employers who were just trying to do something cool.
[365.00 --> 366.00]  This.
[366.00 --> 370.00]  So there's an imaginary game called Yawg Ventures.
[370.00 --> 381.00]  And there's an artist who was originally supposed to work on the project that basically took the $35,000 that was allocated to, presumably him, not actually sure.
[381.00 --> 387.00]  But allocated to the artist and then went and took a job at LucasArts or Lucasfilm, I think it was Lucasfilm.
[387.00 --> 395.00]  And basically booked it with $35,000 for what was supposed to be about six months of work, but actually ended up being two weeks worth of work.
[395.00 --> 411.00]  This caused the Yawg's cast folks to basically lose faith in winter cool games and ask for $150,000 of the Kickstarter money to be given to them in trust to take care of the physical prizes as well as to, you know, this was, it's very unclear.
[411.00 --> 416.00]  This is all very nebulous right now because it's, he said, she said, except she's not talking.
[416.00 --> 431.00]  So, um, so apparently according to winter cool, a hundred thousand of that was supposed to be for miscellaneous things like appearances at trade shows and some promotional activities as well as hiring a lead programmer.
[431.00 --> 436.00]  Um, however, right now, basically the project is completely dead.
[436.00 --> 438.00]  Winter cool is insolvent.
[438.00 --> 439.00]  They're bankrupt.
[439.00 --> 444.00]  And Yawg's cast is not saying much publicly at least.
[444.00 --> 446.00]  So Yawg's cast is the female in this situation?
[446.00 --> 447.00]  I guess so.
[447.00 --> 448.00]  Sure.
[448.00 --> 449.00]  She said she didn't comment.
[449.00 --> 450.00]  Sure.
[450.00 --> 451.00]  Yes.
[451.00 --> 452.00]  Yes.
[452.00 --> 453.00]  I just wanted to clarify.
[453.00 --> 460.00]  So basically what's going on now is Yawg's cast has said, look, there's a lot of inconsistencies in the story that people are being told,
[460.00 --> 464.00]  but we don't really see the point of issuing a statement right now.
[464.00 --> 467.00]  It looks like they're going to kind of wait for the dust to settle.
[467.00 --> 473.00]  But the big question everyone's asking right now is what happened to that hundred thousand dollars that wasn't for physical rewards?
[473.00 --> 475.00]  And what are they going to do?
[475.00 --> 479.00]  Because up till now Yawg's cast has been pointing people towards winter cool to get refunds,
[479.00 --> 483.00]  which obviously is not going to happen when they're bankrupt at this point.
[483.00 --> 488.00]  Um, so let me see if there's anything else that I kind of missed here.
[488.00 --> 495.00]  Getting refunds from Kickstarter things just aren't, isn't really a thing as far as I can tell.
[495.00 --> 501.00]  And as far as I can tell, kickstarting games is just a big problem because, and this is, I mean, honestly,
[501.00 --> 508.00]  this is the same trap that the Yawg's cast guys fell into is they, they trusted a bunch of guys who were experienced filmmaker,
[508.00 --> 519.00]  like animation veterans, but didn't necessarily have, and by their own admission, didn't necessarily have the business savvy to actually create a game studio.
[519.00 --> 531.00]  And so the problem here is that when you put your trust in animators and filmmakers who are great at telling stories and making things look great to make something that they actually don't have any experience doing,
[531.00 --> 537.00]  you end up with a very good trailer for something that might not be anything like that and might not end up existing at all.
[537.00 --> 543.00]  So one thing that Yawg's cast has done is they've given everyone a copy of Nerd King's, Kingston's Tug?
[543.00 --> 548.00]  King, whoa, yeah. Kingston's, yeah. Kingston's Tug open world game.
[548.00 --> 556.00]  But some of the backer options, things like named in-game items are, they've already said, are not or may not be available in that game.
[556.00 --> 562.00]  And so some people are apparently pissed. They haven't communicated much publicly, like I said,
[562.00 --> 568.00]  although reading through comments has actually been more enlightening than reading the articles about what's going on,
[568.00 --> 574.00]  because I've seen people saying, well, hey, I heard from them and they're doing this or they're doing that or...
[574.00 --> 579.00]  Yeah, because apparently Yawg's cast is commenting behind the scenes a lot. They're talking to backers directly,
[579.00 --> 583.00]  probably through the Kickstarter platform or other things instead of making public statements.
[583.00 --> 584.00]  Yeah. Which is...
[584.00 --> 585.00]  I get that. Yeah.
[585.00 --> 589.00]  You don't owe an explanation to the people who didn't give you their money at this point.
[589.00 --> 592.00]  Yeah, but then if you are actively communicating with the Kickstarter people, that's cool.
[592.00 --> 595.00]  So I guess from them it's just a matter of PR damage control.
[595.00 --> 596.00]  Yeah.
[596.00 --> 601.00]  Like, how do you keep yourselves from looking any more bad than you already look?
[601.00 --> 611.00]  Do you make a public apology when in reality, probably a small fraction, like very small fraction of the people that they would reach with a video blast
[611.00 --> 614.00]  or like an apology in every video for a week...
[614.00 --> 615.00]  Have actually backed up.
[615.00 --> 617.00]  Have actually even heard of this.
[617.00 --> 618.00]  Yeah.
[618.00 --> 622.00]  So why bring it up if it's something where they're going to try and figure out a way to take care of these people?
[622.00 --> 626.00]  I guess we just need to see if they end up resolving it to people's satisfaction.
[626.00 --> 627.00]  I mean, I...
[627.00 --> 628.00]  I...
[628.00 --> 629.00]  I...
[629.00 --> 633.00]  I see so many ways that this went south.
[633.00 --> 637.00]  I mean, Wintercool was expecting Yogg's Cast to pimp the game a lot.
[637.00 --> 638.00]  Yeah.
[638.00 --> 645.00]  And so that they'd get that pre-order revenue, which would help them pay salaries, which would help them actually develop the game that they promised to develop.
[645.00 --> 647.00]  Yogg's Cast didn't want to...
[647.00 --> 652.00]  I mean, obviously, if we were funding development of a Linus Tech Tips game where like...
[652.00 --> 654.00]  I don't know.
[654.00 --> 658.00]  Like, it's like a side-scroller combat game where I like shout...
[658.00 --> 659.00]  You're fired!
[659.00 --> 660.00]  You're fired!
[660.00 --> 664.00]  Linus Media Group presents a Linus Tech Tips production, Linus shoots things.
[664.00 --> 665.00]  You're fired!
[665.00 --> 666.00]  You're fired!
[666.00 --> 679.00]  Um, so if that was the objective, and the game was coming along at a pace I wasn't comfortable with, and a quality level that I wasn't comfortable with, am I gonna throw my name behind it more and more and more?
[679.00 --> 686.00]  Like, on the other hand, you know, if they saw this going south, was there time to...
[686.00 --> 687.00]  To deal with it more properly.
[687.00 --> 696.00]  ...salvage it maybe at the time that they renegotiated the contract shortly after the Kickstarter when that artist left, and was there time to kind of terminate it then?
[696.00 --> 697.00]  I don't know.
[697.00 --> 704.00]  It's very hard to say whose fault this is without actually having been on the inside of one side or the other, or in reality, probably both.
[704.00 --> 706.00]  To really know what happened there.
[706.00 --> 707.00]  Pretty interesting.
[707.00 --> 708.00]  There's a...
[708.00 --> 714.00]  I talked about a few Kickstarters that I've done for the last while, but one of them, I'm not gonna be able to remember the name of it, but it's...
[714.00 --> 719.00]  I tried to buy it as a present for my dad.
[719.00 --> 724.00]  I bought it in January of 2012.
[724.00 --> 733.00]  And the plan was, I bought it on Kickstarter January 2012, that was well within the estimated shipping date, and I was hoping that it would show up for Christmas of 2013.
[733.00 --> 736.00]  So like, or Christmas of 2012, I guess, technically.
[736.00 --> 737.00]  Um, it didn't.
[737.00 --> 741.00]  It still didn't show up yet.
[741.00 --> 744.00]  They still haven't even locked down a manufacturer yet.
[744.00 --> 747.00]  And they still don't have their final prototype done yet.
[747.00 --> 749.00]  So, I don't know.
[749.00 --> 754.00]  I used to be like, way behind Kickstarters, and I just mostly ignore that whole website now.
[754.00 --> 755.00]  Yeah.
[755.00 --> 756.00]  Except for like...
[756.00 --> 758.00]  Well, there was that wonderful potato salad.
[758.00 --> 760.00]  I got some.
[760.00 --> 762.00]  Never mind that it was in the mail, stuck in customs for two weeks.
[762.00 --> 763.00]  It was delicious.
[763.00 --> 764.00]  Oh my God.
[764.00 --> 765.00]  I'm just kidding.
[765.00 --> 766.00]  I did not buy potato salad.
[766.00 --> 768.00]  But that is very likely what would happen.
[768.00 --> 770.00]  It would go bad before it got to you.
[770.00 --> 774.00]  But, it's, I see it for things like that balloon thing that we saw recently.
[774.00 --> 775.00]  Yeah.
[775.00 --> 778.00]  Where the guy has already completely designed it, and it's done.
[778.00 --> 779.00]  Yeah.
[779.00 --> 780.00]  That's like, okay, cool.
[780.00 --> 785.00]  It's, it's basically, it's just a pack of pre-attached balloons on three plastic nozzles.
[785.00 --> 789.00]  And the idea is you can fill a hundred water balloons in under a minute.
[789.00 --> 790.00]  Which is beast.
[790.00 --> 793.00]  Nozzle, fill them up, and then you give it a shake, and they all pre-tie.
[793.00 --> 798.00]  So, you can fill up a big thing of them, and it costs like, however much for a pack.
[798.00 --> 803.00]  And I've seen a lot of people going, well, it's like, really stupid that it's one-time
[803.00 --> 804.00]  use, blah, blah, blah.
[804.00 --> 805.00]  How is that more efficient?
[805.00 --> 810.00]  It's more efficient because, and people have been like, you should be able to put the balloons
[810.00 --> 811.00]  back on the thing.
[811.00 --> 814.00]  I'm like, that's not any faster than tying them by hand.
[814.00 --> 819.00]  The idea here is that for a couple bucks, let's say you're a scout troop or something.
[819.00 --> 820.00]  Okay?
[820.00 --> 825.00]  So, for like a hundred bucks, when you organize an event, you can have, you know, however
[825.00 --> 829.00]  many hundreds of water balloons ready to go in like a few minutes.
[829.00 --> 831.00]  Instead of wasting a whole day.
[831.00 --> 835.00]  Instead of wasting an entire day having volunteers sit and tie water balloons.
[835.00 --> 838.00]  You can just factor in how much people's time is worth.
[838.00 --> 840.00]  It's a pretty good deal.
[840.00 --> 841.00]  I think it's pretty cool.
[841.00 --> 844.00]  And even if you're just a home resident, if it's really nice outside and you want to
[844.00 --> 847.00]  go play with water balloons, instead of filling up water balloons for half an hour to an hour,
[847.00 --> 852.00]  you can just be like, tie this thing on three or four times and then you're good to go.
[852.00 --> 853.00]  Like, it's not that bad.
[853.00 --> 855.00]  And it's already fitted to screw onto your hose.
[855.00 --> 857.00]  So, it's super easy.
[857.00 --> 858.00]  This is awesome.
[858.00 --> 862.00]  This is a Kickstarter that I backed just so that when it doesn't arrive or when it's
[862.00 --> 867.00]  a gigantic piece of crap, I can make a video about how stupid backing...
[867.00 --> 869.00]  Isn't it not shipping to like 2016 or something?
[869.00 --> 872.00]  End of the year, next year or something like that.
[872.00 --> 873.00]  Okay.
[873.00 --> 874.00]  I don't think I have sound.
[874.00 --> 875.00]  I can't hear it anyway.
[875.00 --> 876.00]  Hold on.
[876.00 --> 878.00]  And somewhere in between is this guy.
[878.00 --> 881.00]  Introducing Jibo, the world's first family robot.
[881.00 --> 882.00]  Say hi, Jibo.
[882.00 --> 883.00]  Hi, Jibo.
[883.00 --> 887.00]  Jibo helps everyone out.
[887.00 --> 888.00]  So that wasn't hard-coded.
[888.00 --> 890.00]  He's the world's best cameraman.
[890.00 --> 896.00]  By intelligently tracking the action around him, he can independently take video and photos,
[896.00 --> 900.00]  so that you can put down your camera and be a part of the scene.
[900.00 --> 902.00]  Jibo, take the picture.
[902.00 --> 905.00]  Totally out of focus.
[905.00 --> 916.00]  Anyway, the point is, if that manages to arrive in 2015, and if it has anywhere near the
[916.00 --> 919.00]  level of interaction ability...
[919.00 --> 920.00]  It's up on the table in that shot, isn't it?
[920.00 --> 921.00]  Yeah.
[921.00 --> 922.00]  So you have to like carry it around.
[922.00 --> 924.00]  Yeah, you have to like move it around and stuff.
[924.00 --> 927.00]  Like it's just, it's the kind of thing where it's like, um, it's like someone was watching
[927.00 --> 931.00]  the Jetsons and they're just like, wow!
[931.00 --> 932.00]  Let's do that!
[932.00 --> 933.00]  Let's like...
[933.00 --> 934.00]  Let's start an IndieGoGo.
[934.00 --> 939.00]  Let's make the little like cleaner robot, except like stationary and sits on the table
[939.00 --> 940.00]  and like...
[940.00 --> 941.00]  Everyone in Twitch chat is like NSA Skynet.
[941.00 --> 944.00]  Yeah, exactly right.
[944.00 --> 950.00]  Alright, I just got an email from the owner of Swift Tech.
[950.00 --> 951.00]  I didn't.
[951.00 --> 953.00]  Well, whatever.
[953.00 --> 954.00]  I'm cooler than you.
[954.00 --> 957.00]  Uh, so I just got an email, but you're gonna like the scene...
[957.00 --> 959.00]  Actually, I got two emails today that you're gonna be pretty stoked on.
[959.00 --> 960.00]  Yes, it's about that.
[960.00 --> 961.00]  Yeah!
[961.00 --> 964.00]  So we have an exciting new project to announce.
[964.00 --> 970.00]  We are going to be liquid cooling an entire room of computers on a single loop.
[970.00 --> 974.00]  So we're gonna give you guys way more details in the coming weeks.
[974.00 --> 976.00]  Um, but basically it's all coming together.
[976.00 --> 981.00]  I've already got our sponsor confirmed for cases, power supplies, and uh, cause we, like
[981.00 --> 986.00]  we want all the hardware to be somewhat similar, so we're not just Frankensteining every single
[986.00 --> 987.00]  one of them as a one off.
[987.00 --> 988.00]  For once.
[988.00 --> 990.00]  So we're consolidating on a single case.
[990.00 --> 992.00]  We're gonna be using a Cooler Master N600.
[992.00 --> 995.00]  We're all gonna be using their V750 modular power supply.
[995.00 --> 997.00]  So actually a really good power supply.
[997.00 --> 1002.00]  Uh, HardOCP just did a review on the, uh, on the V series and validated what I was pretty
[1002.00 --> 1005.00]  sure we already knew about them, but anyway, they had a review recently.
[1005.00 --> 1006.00]  Anyway.
[1006.00 --> 1007.00]  Um, so we're getting those.
[1007.00 --> 1010.00]  Um, water cooling is now locked down.
[1010.00 --> 1016.00]  So every machine will have an Apogee XL as well as a Swift-Tec's full cover with like the lighting
[1016.00 --> 1019.00]  back-plated, uh, full cover block for an NVIDIA graphics card.
[1019.00 --> 1033.00]  Uh, we are going to have radiators mounted to the systems on quick disconnects so that in the event that a system does have to be moved, we can disconnect it from the room-wide loop, connect it to its own rad, and move it without interrupting the rest of the machines.
[1033.00 --> 1038.00]  Um, we are going to have the radiators mounted outside the building.
[1038.00 --> 1047.00]  So the idea here is that because it's been so hot in the office, we will be able to take the heat out of the room with our liquid cooling.
[1047.00 --> 1052.00]  Because contrary to what a lot of people think, water cooling doesn't make your room run cooler.
[1052.00 --> 1053.00]  Okay?
[1053.00 --> 1054.00]  Just dumps more heat in the room.
[1054.00 --> 1055.00]  Yeah.
[1055.00 --> 1056.00]  It dumps the same amount of heat in the room.
[1056.00 --> 1058.00]  Basically, exactly the same.
[1058.00 --> 1061.00]  I'll go with basically the same.
[1061.00 --> 1065.00]  Basically, it's a very, very, very small rounding error.
[1065.00 --> 1066.00]  So the point-
[1066.00 --> 1068.00]  But I, I just can't say exactly.
[1068.00 --> 1074.00]  The point is that removing it from the room is the only way to make your room actually cooler.
[1074.00 --> 1078.00]  And when you have a bunch of people editing videos in a room, then that's like-
[1078.00 --> 1082.00]  This is a solution for not buying, um, AC.
[1082.00 --> 1083.00]  Air conditioning.
[1083.00 --> 1084.00]  Yeah.
[1084.00 --> 1085.00]  Okay.
[1085.00 --> 1090.00]  So anyway, they're going to go to a series of radiators mounted outside the house and a reservoir that's going to sit in a bathtub.
[1090.00 --> 1092.00]  It's like a five gallon reservoir.
[1092.00 --> 1093.00]  Yeah.
[1093.00 --> 1094.00]  We're going to have an industrial grade pump.
[1094.00 --> 1101.00]  And then every system will actually have its own pump as well to help deal with the pressure drop as the water goes through all the components.
[1101.00 --> 1106.00]  So we're not going to have any undue strain on any one part of the entire setup.
[1106.00 --> 1108.00]  So every, yeah, every computer will have 655s.
[1108.00 --> 1110.00]  So, so funny story-
[1110.00 --> 1111.00]  Is that-
[1111.00 --> 1112.00]  Yeah.
[1112.00 --> 1113.00]  Yeah.
[1113.00 --> 1114.00]  Yeah.
[1114.00 --> 1115.00]  655 pumps.
[1115.00 --> 1121.00]  So funny story is I reached out to Nvidia because we were going to need cards that were compatible with the blocks.
[1121.00 --> 1128.00]  And I asked them if it was okay for us to get 780s because we do use CUDA for a lot of our editing needs.
[1128.00 --> 1132.00]  Uh, we do have a couple of 780s around here, but the problem is that they're non-reference.
[1132.00 --> 1136.00]  And so the one that we have that's reference is the one that we use for our reference benchmarking.
[1136.00 --> 1140.00]  And then the non-reference ones we have are not compatible with water cooling.
[1140.00 --> 1146.00]  And if we were to take all the heat from the CPUs out of the room, that would help a little bit, but not enough to be worth a project like this.
[1146.00 --> 1149.00]  You want to get that GPU heat out of the room.
[1149.00 --> 1151.00]  I think just buying an air conditioning unit would be-
[1151.00 --> 1152.00]  I think you're crazy.
[1152.00 --> 1157.00]  Anyway, the point is that, um, I got an email back from them.
[1157.00 --> 1160.00]  They kind of went, uh, I'm not sure about this project.
[1160.00 --> 1167.00]  Um, I think that Titan Blacks would be more appropriate for something like workstation use in this manner.
[1167.00 --> 1171.00]  So, uh, so apparently everyone's workstation is getting a Titan Black.
[1171.00 --> 1172.00]  Do I get one too?
[1172.00 --> 1173.00]  Uh, no.
[1173.00 --> 1174.00]  Why?
[1174.00 --> 1175.00]  Because you're not in that room.
[1175.00 --> 1176.00]  Whatever.
[1176.00 --> 1177.00]  You can request a transfer.
[1177.00 --> 1179.00]  I'll have the CEO look at it personally.
[1179.00 --> 1182.00]  My computer just straight up blue screened when I was working on it the other day.
[1182.00 --> 1185.00]  I was like, damn my ghetto system.
[1185.00 --> 1187.00]  Um, so, so that's happening.
[1187.00 --> 1188.00]  That's cool.
[1188.00 --> 1193.00]  So we're moving all of our editors to 6-core LGA 2011.
[1193.00 --> 1196.00]  Um, not everyone has an extreme edition, I don't think.
[1196.00 --> 1198.00]  And then to Titan Blacks.
[1198.00 --> 1199.00]  That would be so epic.
[1199.00 --> 1200.00]  For all the CUDA.
[1200.00 --> 1205.00]  Taren will finally have a computer that can like, actually use other people's files properly and stuff.
[1205.00 --> 1207.00]  I know, I know.
[1207.00 --> 1209.00]  We have one of our editors on an AMD card.
[1209.00 --> 1210.00]  Only one.
[1210.00 --> 1213.00]  And there's nothing inherently bad about that.
[1213.00 --> 1217.00]  It's just that the other guys are using plugins and tools that are CUDA tools.
[1217.00 --> 1218.00]  CUDA, yeah.
[1218.00 --> 1219.00]  Yeah.
[1219.00 --> 1222.00]  And so when he goes to work on their stuff on his computer, it's just like bleh.
[1222.00 --> 1223.00]  Or the other way around.
[1223.00 --> 1224.00]  Yeah.
[1224.00 --> 1227.00]  If the Nvidia card tries to open something that the AMD card was working on, it's bleh.
[1227.00 --> 1228.00]  Every time.
[1228.00 --> 1230.00]  It's, they, they don't really like using the same file sets.
[1230.00 --> 1235.00]  So if anyone wants to ever work with something that he was working with or the other way around, it's, it's.
[1235.00 --> 1236.00]  Yeah.
[1236.00 --> 1237.00]  It's not good for the workflow.
[1237.00 --> 1238.00]  It's terrible.
[1238.00 --> 1243.00]  It's good to consolidate on one platform when you're trying to, when you're trying to share work between people.
[1243.00 --> 1244.00]  Yeah.
[1244.00 --> 1247.00]  Um, I'm just trying to think if there's anything else that I am forgetting.
[1247.00 --> 1249.00]  Some people have been like, Luke, stop him.
[1249.00 --> 1251.00]  I've told them many, many, many, many, many times.
[1251.00 --> 1252.00]  Oh yeah.
[1252.00 --> 1253.00]  We, we, we know this is crazy.
[1253.00 --> 1254.00]  Oh yeah.
[1254.00 --> 1255.00]  Hundred percent.
[1255.00 --> 1256.00]  Yep.
[1256.00 --> 1261.00]  I'm not certain that this is a crazy idea, but it's going to be freaking awesome.
[1261.00 --> 1262.00]  It's going to be fun.
[1262.00 --> 1263.00]  Yeah.
[1263.00 --> 1264.00]  Yeah.
[1264.00 --> 1265.00]  It's going to be fun.
[1265.00 --> 1266.00]  We're going to do worst case scenario.
[1266.00 --> 1268.00]  The whole room loop is a complete disaster.
[1268.00 --> 1272.00]  The pipes blow off and the water's all over the place and we kind of go, Oh crap.
[1272.00 --> 1275.00]  And then my dad didn't hard pipe the whole thing.
[1275.00 --> 1280.00]  And then we, Hey, I've already thought about this.
[1280.00 --> 1281.00]  We should do that.
[1281.00 --> 1282.00]  I know.
[1282.00 --> 1283.00]  We should just do that anyway.
[1283.00 --> 1284.00]  Probably.
[1284.00 --> 1285.00]  We could get a fatter line too.
[1285.00 --> 1286.00]  Yeah.
[1286.00 --> 1288.00]  How much would he charge for that?
[1288.00 --> 1289.00]  I could ask him.
[1289.00 --> 1290.00]  I don't know.
[1290.00 --> 1291.00]  Yeah.
[1291.00 --> 1292.00]  I know.
[1292.00 --> 1293.00]  I'll ask him.
[1293.00 --> 1294.00]  He's not back yet.
[1294.00 --> 1295.00]  I was already going to talk to him.
[1295.00 --> 1296.00]  Interesting.
[1296.00 --> 1301.00]  Cause I think that'll solve like quite a few of the problems.
[1301.00 --> 1302.00]  People are like, Luke, stop him.
[1302.00 --> 1305.00]  But Luke's just trying to figure out how to take it to a whole new level of insanity.
[1305.00 --> 1306.00]  Because you know, okay.
[1306.00 --> 1307.00]  I've accepted that it's happening.
[1307.00 --> 1311.00]  Now it's just, how can we make it even more ridiculous and cool?
[1311.00 --> 1312.00]  Yeah.
[1312.00 --> 1315.00]  Cause I was just going to like, I was just going to come up with some kind of like a wall mounting
[1315.00 --> 1317.00]  bracket thing or something to run the tubing around.
[1317.00 --> 1319.00]  But we could just put like roof hooks.
[1319.00 --> 1320.00]  But that would be better.
[1320.00 --> 1322.00]  Anyway, worst case scenario, we disconnect the whole room thing.
[1322.00 --> 1326.00]  We give up and we go to each system being individually liquid cooled, which isn't that crazy.
[1326.00 --> 1327.00]  No.
[1327.00 --> 1331.00]  A D5 liquid cooled system with Swift Tech gear is not a problem.
[1331.00 --> 1332.00]  No.
[1332.00 --> 1333.00]  It's fine.
[1333.00 --> 1334.00]  It would be fine.
[1334.00 --> 1335.00]  Not a problem.
[1335.00 --> 1336.00]  We'll just move the rads inside the case.
[1336.00 --> 1339.00]  We should totally overclock the workstations.
[1339.00 --> 1341.00]  You know we have to do it.
[1341.00 --> 1344.00]  Once we don't have to worry about the heat dump into the room and we don't have to worry
[1344.00 --> 1345.00]  about throttling.
[1345.00 --> 1349.00]  Because the problem is that two of their systems are thermal throttling whenever we render.
[1349.00 --> 1351.00]  That would be an interesting case for binning.
[1351.00 --> 1352.00]  Yeah.
[1352.00 --> 1356.00]  Because we could see, we could try to limit every system and then see which ones come
[1356.00 --> 1357.00]  out like which.
[1357.00 --> 1360.00]  I think we don't have enough of the same processor.
[1360.00 --> 1361.00]  Not really.
[1361.00 --> 1362.00]  Yeah.
[1362.00 --> 1365.00]  Because we have like, I think we have like 13960X, 149 something.
[1365.00 --> 1366.00]  Oh yeah.
[1366.00 --> 1367.00]  So they'll be kind of all of this.
[1367.00 --> 1368.00]  And then we have a K.
[1368.00 --> 1369.00]  Yeah.
[1369.00 --> 1370.00]  I think those are, those are the six cores we have.
[1370.00 --> 1371.00]  So I don't know.
[1371.00 --> 1372.00]  Right.
[1372.00 --> 1373.00]  All right.
[1373.00 --> 1376.00]  So yeah, we are, we are, we are.
[1376.00 --> 1377.00]  This is going to be fun.
[1377.00 --> 1380.00]  That way all the pipes could be copper even.
[1380.00 --> 1381.00]  Yeah.
[1381.00 --> 1382.00]  And that would just be so nice.
[1382.00 --> 1383.00]  Yeah.
[1383.00 --> 1384.00]  I don't know.
[1384.00 --> 1385.00]  It would be pretty cool.
[1385.00 --> 1386.00]  It would be badass.
[1386.00 --> 1387.00]  So it's all of his pipes too.
[1387.00 --> 1388.00]  Right.
[1388.00 --> 1389.00]  So it would look awesome.
[1389.00 --> 1390.00]  Yeah.
[1390.00 --> 1393.00]  And like, it wouldn't like, we'd have to figure out how we want the, the fittings to
[1393.00 --> 1394.00]  work to come out to the systems.
[1394.00 --> 1398.00]  Cause I'd want to be able to move desks around if we really need to, you know, like if we
[1398.00 --> 1400.00]  had like a, like a fitting system.
[1400.00 --> 1403.00]  You could, you could T line every once in a while and then have it go to a flexible
[1403.00 --> 1404.00]  pipe.
[1404.00 --> 1405.00]  Okay.
[1405.00 --> 1406.00]  We'll figure it out.
[1406.00 --> 1407.00]  We'll figure it out.
[1407.00 --> 1411.00]  So, uh, so yeah, we'll be, we'll be, we'll be overclocking the workstations, maybe just
[1411.00 --> 1412.00]  a little bit, not a ton.
[1412.00 --> 1415.00]  You don't want to overclock a workstation to the max, but, uh, yeah.
[1415.00 --> 1416.00]  Yeah.
[1416.00 --> 1417.00]  Anyway.
[1417.00 --> 1422.00]  So the confirmations here, the fact that we've got cases, power supplies, uh, knocked to
[1422.00 --> 1423.00]  us in already.
[1423.00 --> 1424.00]  So, oh, right.
[1424.00 --> 1425.00]  The outside fans will be there.
[1425.00 --> 1429.00]  Uh, their water resistant fans, which totally makes sense.
[1429.00 --> 1430.00]  Totally makes sense.
[1430.00 --> 1431.00]  We actually came up with it.
[1431.00 --> 1434.00]  It's funny because I teased them about it in the video.
[1434.00 --> 1436.00]  I was like, why does anyone need a waterproof fan?
[1436.00 --> 1437.00]  That's stupid.
[1437.00 --> 1438.00]  Oh, wait, because we're doing something stupid.
[1438.00 --> 1444.00]  Because we're going to hang quadruple rads off the fascia boards of the building and then
[1444.00 --> 1445.00]  have fans behind them.
[1445.00 --> 1450.00]  We're going to have those running off Swift Tech PWM splitters so that we can actually control
[1450.00 --> 1451.00]  them if we really need to.
[1451.00 --> 1456.00]  And then we're going to have, um, all those, I figure we'll probably run those rads all in
[1456.00 --> 1457.00]  parallel.
[1457.00 --> 1460.00]  Because otherwise you're going to get a lot of pressure drop from five quadruple rads
[1460.00 --> 1461.00]  in a row.
[1461.00 --> 1462.00]  So, yeah.
[1462.00 --> 1467.00]  Our neighbor's just going to be like, what?
[1467.00 --> 1473.00]  Our neighbor's like this super nice lady who's like super nice, but also pays a lot of attention
[1473.00 --> 1474.00]  to our house.
[1474.00 --> 1475.00]  She's a good neighbor.
[1475.00 --> 1480.00]  Um, which means she'll notice that there's like stuff hanging off our house.
[1480.00 --> 1482.00]  So epic.
[1482.00 --> 1484.00]  So she'll probably ask us.
[1484.00 --> 1485.00]  Yeah.
[1485.00 --> 1486.00]  Yeah.
[1486.00 --> 1487.00]  Yeah.
[1487.00 --> 1488.00]  Super, super nice lady.
[1488.00 --> 1489.00]  But she'll notice.
[1489.00 --> 1490.00]  What are those weird loud things?
[1490.00 --> 1491.00]  Yeah.
[1491.00 --> 1492.00]  What the heck?
[1492.00 --> 1493.00]  What are those?
[1493.00 --> 1495.00]  Should I ask for 2,000 RPM or 3,000 RPM?
[1495.00 --> 1499.00]  I mean, when we're talking about that much surface area, 2,000 RPM is probably fine, right?
[1499.00 --> 1503.00]  On the other hand, 3,000 RPM is like a thousand more RPM.
[1503.00 --> 1504.00]  Yeah.
[1504.00 --> 1505.00]  We have those controllable splitters.
[1505.00 --> 1506.00]  That's true.
[1506.00 --> 1507.00]  So we could just pull it down.
[1507.00 --> 1508.00]  We could.
[1508.00 --> 1512.00]  We could just get a PWM fan controller and hook that up there.
[1512.00 --> 1513.00]  Oh.
[1513.00 --> 1514.00]  IGN has a delayed video launch.
[1514.00 --> 1515.00]  Sorry.
[1515.00 --> 1518.00]  It's really not too bad because it auto plays, but it auto plays after a while and it tells
[1518.00 --> 1519.00]  you that it's going to do that.
[1519.00 --> 1521.00]  So I don't hate this as much as Tweakdown.
[1521.00 --> 1522.00]  Okay.
[1522.00 --> 1529.00]  So this is like the biggest copycat ever because it wasn't that long ago that Linus Media Group
[1529.00 --> 1535.00]  and Tech Syndicate and Austin Evans and New Egg TV, they went to the top of a mountain
[1535.00 --> 1536.00]  to play a video game.
[1536.00 --> 1537.00]  I literally can't even.
[1537.00 --> 1538.00]  I literally can't even.
[1538.00 --> 1539.00]  Sorry, what?
[1539.00 --> 1540.00]  I literally can't even.
[1540.00 --> 1541.00]  That's a thing.
[1541.00 --> 1543.00]  I literally can't even.
[1543.00 --> 1549.00]  So anyway, the point is Ubisoft announces a Far Cry 4 competition, Quest for Everest.
[1549.00 --> 1551.00]  Oh my God, I keep signing me up.
[1551.00 --> 1552.00]  What are you doing?
[1552.00 --> 1558.00]  This is a 14-night sponsor-specified accommodation thing.
[1558.00 --> 1559.00]  We should get John in.
[1559.00 --> 1560.00]  Sorry?
[1560.00 --> 1561.00]  What?
[1561.00 --> 1563.00]  We should try and push to get John in.
[1563.00 --> 1564.00]  To get John in?
[1564.00 --> 1565.00]  That was the guy that came in.
[1565.00 --> 1566.00]  Yeah, I know who John is.
[1566.00 --> 1567.00]  Yeah.
[1567.00 --> 1570.00]  I don't know if we'd be able to create a video entry that would be good enough to win it.
[1570.00 --> 1572.00]  I mean, the grand prize is a 14-night.
[1572.00 --> 1577.00]  I've only found one person who has a submission so far and they're not going to make it.
[1577.00 --> 1578.00]  Really?
[1578.00 --> 1579.00]  Yeah.
[1579.00 --> 1582.00]  Okay, well it's a 14-night sponsor-specified accommodation thing.
[1582.00 --> 1586.00]  You get a guided trek to the Mount Everest base camp.
[1586.00 --> 1588.00]  To be clear, you will not be going to the summit.
[1588.00 --> 1592.00]  I've seen a few different reporting sites and a lot of different people talking about,
[1592.00 --> 1595.00]  Oh my God, going to the summit is impossible.
[1595.00 --> 1597.00]  And no, it's to the base camp.
[1597.00 --> 1602.00]  It's still going to be crazy, ridiculously ridiculous, but it's not to the summit.
[1602.00 --> 1606.00]  So this is basically the success rate.
[1606.00 --> 1610.00]  So how many summits and what the success rate was over the last however many years.
[1610.00 --> 1612.00]  This is from National Geographic?
[1612.00 --> 1613.00]  Yeah.
[1613.00 --> 1614.00]  Yeah, National Geographic.
[1614.00 --> 1620.00]  So you can see that if Ubisoft was trying to get a gamer to the top, and nothing against gamers.
[1620.00 --> 1621.00]  I love gamers.
[1621.00 --> 1623.00]  Gamers are good people.
[1623.00 --> 1630.00]  But climbing Mount Everest is not something where being a good person is enough.
[1630.00 --> 1631.00]  It's not about that.
[1631.00 --> 1632.00]  It's about being in a-
[1632.00 --> 1634.00]  You have such a good heart that you just like float to the top.
[1634.00 --> 1637.00]  Yeah, it's about being in an amazing physical condition.
[1637.00 --> 1639.00]  Like, this isn't the Grinch, man.
[1639.00 --> 1643.00]  This isn't the little dog carries the sled to the top of the mountain like no big deal.
[1643.00 --> 1644.00]  Yeah.
[1644.00 --> 1645.00]  This is like serious stuff.
[1645.00 --> 1647.00]  And you've got to train for it.
[1647.00 --> 1650.00]  You've got to acclimate to the altitude.
[1650.00 --> 1657.00]  You have to just have a physical disposition that is capable of handling it.
[1657.00 --> 1660.00]  Like you might just be unlucky and can't do it.
[1660.00 --> 1661.00]  And that's fine.
[1661.00 --> 1662.00]  You're not a bad person.
[1662.00 --> 1665.00]  You're just not able to summit Mount Everest.
[1665.00 --> 1666.00]  So it's the base camp.
[1666.00 --> 1667.00]  Which is like, that's fine.
[1667.00 --> 1673.00]  Which I think some people who I've seen who have commented on, oh, it's just a base camp
[1673.00 --> 1674.00]  that's like stupid.
[1674.00 --> 1675.00]  No.
[1675.00 --> 1678.00]  I think probably don't realize that base camp is still pretty intense.
[1678.00 --> 1681.00]  Their base camp is incredibly high and it's like not that easy to get to.
[1681.00 --> 1686.00]  And their base camp is more just like a grouping of tents, I believe.
[1686.00 --> 1689.00]  Let me just find the elevation of the base camp.
[1689.00 --> 1691.00]  It's still really, really high.
[1691.00 --> 1696.00]  I think their base camp was considerably taller than the mountain that we climbed.
[1696.00 --> 1697.00]  Yes.
[1697.00 --> 1698.00]  Yeah.
[1698.00 --> 1701.00]  So base camp is about 17 and a half thousand feet.
[1701.00 --> 1707.00]  And then there's a north base camp in Tibet at just shy of 17,000 feet.
[1707.00 --> 1708.00]  But you'll be, I'm so sure you'll be.
[1708.00 --> 1714.00]  This is thousands of feet higher than we were when we did our Mount Elbert summit thing with
[1714.00 --> 1715.00]  the land party.
[1715.00 --> 1716.00]  Like it's nuts.
[1716.00 --> 1717.00]  Yeah.
[1717.00 --> 1725.00]  So basically the, the articles about this are like, yeah, they, they asked us to pass along
[1725.00 --> 1730.00]  that there's an inherent risk of death and significant injury to persons and property
[1730.00 --> 1732.00]  associated with the quest for Everest experience.
[1732.00 --> 1735.00]  And by participating, Winner understands and assumes this risk.
[1735.00 --> 1739.00]  And there's like tons of physical trials that you have to undergo before they'll even accept
[1739.00 --> 1740.00]  you.
[1740.00 --> 1743.00]  And if you don't pass the physical trials and they picked you, they'll just pick someone
[1743.00 --> 1744.00]  else.
[1744.00 --> 1747.00]  And then you're dropping all of your awards and all of your prizes and just picking someone
[1747.00 --> 1748.00]  else.
[1748.00 --> 1751.00]  Cause they're not going to deal with like having someone that isn't ready to go up.
[1751.00 --> 1753.00]  This is something I actually wasn't even aware of.
[1753.00 --> 1754.00]  This is crazy.
[1754.00 --> 1755.00]  The overcrowding?
[1755.00 --> 1756.00]  Yeah.
[1756.00 --> 1761.00]  Apparently climbing Everest is like, like, it's become kind of nuts.
[1761.00 --> 1767.00]  That's the reason why I wanted to show that original graphic of success rate because, um,
[1767.00 --> 1772.00]  gear ability of Sherpas knowledge on the internet, all this kind of stuff has massively increased
[1772.00 --> 1777.00]  your possibility of making it up, especially stuff like gear and technology and pre-run lines
[1777.00 --> 1781.00]  and knowledge in general, like that the south path is a lot better to take than the north
[1781.00 --> 1783.00]  path and a few other things like that.
[1783.00 --> 1785.00]  But there's been massive overcrowding.
[1785.00 --> 1789.00]  Um, people have brought up that of course there's better times to climb than others.
[1789.00 --> 1794.00]  So these photos are probably taken during really good times to climb, but it doesn't get rid
[1794.00 --> 1800.00]  of the fact that as of right now, a lot of people are making it to the top and these groups
[1800.00 --> 1801.00]  are all going as once.
[1801.00 --> 1805.00]  So you're going to be walking in this like conga line almost the whole way up walking
[1805.00 --> 1806.00]  and climbing.
[1806.00 --> 1807.00]  There's shots.
[1807.00 --> 1810.00]  I don't think they're necessarily in here, even when there's like 10 to 20 people on
[1810.00 --> 1811.00]  the same rope.
[1811.00 --> 1812.00]  Yeah.
[1812.00 --> 1814.00]  Going up the side.
[1814.00 --> 1820.00]  And then there's a serious garbage issue where I think right now there's something in effect
[1820.00 --> 1825.00]  where you have to come down with a minimum amount of garbage or else you get fined or
[1825.00 --> 1826.00]  something.
[1826.00 --> 1827.00]  Right.
[1827.00 --> 1829.00]  And a lot of people are just paying the fine.
[1829.00 --> 1832.00]  And there's just tons of garbage.
[1832.00 --> 1833.00]  It's not good.
[1833.00 --> 1834.00]  Really not good.
[1834.00 --> 1838.00]  But yeah, I wanted to point that out because it's almost unfortunate timing that they're
[1838.00 --> 1842.00]  bringing more attention to Everest right now because they're going through all these problems
[1842.00 --> 1845.00]  of overcrowding and garbage issues and stuff like that.
[1845.00 --> 1848.00]  There's even groups coming together where they climb part way up and just grab all the
[1848.00 --> 1850.00]  garbage that they possibly can and then come back down.
[1850.00 --> 1851.00]  Right.
[1851.00 --> 1854.00]  Because they're trying to clean up the mountain because it's so bad.
[1854.00 --> 1856.00]  It's like, wow.
[1856.00 --> 1857.00]  Okay.
[1857.00 --> 1859.00]  People just ruin everything, don't they?
[1859.00 --> 1860.00]  All right.
[1860.00 --> 1864.00]  Speaking of ruining everything, it's time to bring Barnacles onto the show.
[1864.00 --> 1871.00]  So do you want to get him sort of arranged over there while I cover our rumor topic?
[1871.00 --> 1873.00]  Dun dun dun!
[1873.00 --> 1876.00]  This was originally posted by Tech Check.
[1876.00 --> 1882.00]  And speaking of words whose spelling have nothing to do with how to pronounce them, check, like
[1882.00 --> 1883.00]  really?
[1883.00 --> 1884.00]  C-Z?
[1884.00 --> 1885.00]  What's C-Z?
[1885.00 --> 1890.00]  Apparently, I made a mistake in last night's or the night before's Tech Quickie video where
[1890.00 --> 1893.00]  I pronounced Brisbane, Brisbane.
[1893.00 --> 1895.00]  And for that, I am very sorry.
[1895.00 --> 1896.00]  Is it not even spelled that way though?
[1896.00 --> 1897.00]  No.
[1897.00 --> 1899.00]  B-R-I-S-B-A-N-E or whatever.
[1899.00 --> 1900.00]  Oh, okay.
[1900.00 --> 1901.00]  Yeah.
[1901.00 --> 1904.00]  It's spelled that way, but that's not how you say it.
[1904.00 --> 1910.00]  And within moments of the video being up, there were comments about herder, lol, Linus
[1910.00 --> 1912.00]  doesn't know how to pronounce Brisbane.
[1912.00 --> 1914.00]  And my wife was like, what?
[1914.00 --> 1915.00]  Really?
[1915.00 --> 1916.00]  Even I knew that.
[1916.00 --> 1918.00]  And you know how good I am at geography.
[1918.00 --> 1921.00]  I'm like, yeah, okay, yeah, I made a mistake.
[1921.00 --> 1922.00]  It's very funny.
[1922.00 --> 1924.00]  So yes, my bad, you guys.
[1924.00 --> 1931.00]  I'm very sorry to everyone who lives in India or wherever Brisbane is.
[1931.00 --> 1932.00]  Just kidding.
[1932.00 --> 1933.00]  Just kidding.
[1933.00 --> 1934.00]  I know it's not in India.
[1934.00 --> 1939.00]  So I'm very sorry to all of you down under and I apologize.
[1939.00 --> 1941.00]  And can I help you with something?
[1941.00 --> 1942.00]  I didn't have headphones.
[1942.00 --> 1947.00]  Alright, I wanted to do a quick rumor topic before we bring on our large guest.
[1947.00 --> 1948.00]  Here we go.
[1948.00 --> 1950.00]  So this was originally posted by Tech Check.
[1950.00 --> 1953.00]  And it is rumored that the GT- I'm getting a look from them right now.
[1953.00 --> 1959.00]  It was rumored that the GTX 870 and 880 are coming in October.
[1959.00 --> 1963.00]  It is rumored to be a GM204 chip, still a 28 nanometer chip.
[1963.00 --> 1964.00]  Are you looking for a splitter?
[1964.00 --> 1965.00]  Splitter.
[1965.00 --> 1966.00]  Can I help you?
[1966.00 --> 1967.00]  Yeah.
[1967.00 --> 1968.00]  With finding a splitter?
[1968.00 --> 1969.00]  Where's the splitter?
[1969.00 --> 1970.00]  It's supposed to live right here.
[1970.00 --> 1972.00]  You are splitting my patience.
[1972.00 --> 1974.00]  I have no idea.
[1974.00 --> 1975.00]  There should be one in that bin.
[1975.00 --> 1976.00]  It's under here.
[1976.00 --> 1977.00]  Oh, okay.
[1977.00 --> 1978.00]  That's good.
[1978.00 --> 1979.00]  Touch it with your feet some more.
[1979.00 --> 1982.00]  You know, I don't have to plug my things into that.
[1982.00 --> 1984.00]  You don't touch it when you plug it in.
[1984.00 --> 1985.00]  Well, I could.
[1985.00 --> 1986.00]  Or I could taste it.
[1986.00 --> 1987.00]  No, I won't do that.
[1987.00 --> 1988.00]  Okay.
[1988.00 --> 1989.00]  Anyway, the point is-
[1989.00 --> 1991.00]  I just did my phone soap thing.
[1991.00 --> 1992.00]  Don't like that.
[1992.00 --> 1998.00]  The size of the chip is estimated to be between GK104 and GK110, which makes sense.
[1998.00 --> 2001.00]  I mean, GK104 was never really intended.
[2001.00 --> 2004.00]  This is, again, all conspiracy theory.
[2004.00 --> 2008.00]  NVIDIA has never confirmed this, but it was never seemed to be really intended to be a
[2008.00 --> 2009.00]  truly high-end chip.
[2009.00 --> 2013.00]  But GK110 was extremely large and very expensive.
[2013.00 --> 2017.00]  So it's rumored to perform better than a 780 Ti.
[2017.00 --> 2023.00]  The memory interface is rumored to be 256 bits, and it is rumored to consume less power
[2023.00 --> 2025.00]  than 780 Ti.
[2025.00 --> 2030.00]  And the memory capacity is rumored to be 8 gigabytes.
[2030.00 --> 2038.00]  So that's quite the set of rumors there about gigabytes and bits.
[2038.00 --> 2040.00]  Anyway, I don't have anything to say about that.
[2040.00 --> 2046.00]  I haven't heard anything from NVIDIA at this time, so that's why I'm going ahead and commenting
[2046.00 --> 2047.00]  on rumors.
[2047.00 --> 2051.00]  Speaking of rumors, there's one rumor that I wasn't able to comment on not that long ago,
[2051.00 --> 2054.00]  but of course now NVIDIA has unveiled.
[2054.00 --> 2060.00]  Can't say anything about it because the review embargo has not passed yet.
[2060.00 --> 2065.00]  I'm not even going to say when that is, but I will say I do have a Shield tablet, and I
[2065.00 --> 2067.00]  don't even think I can say, like, it's great or anything.
[2067.00 --> 2068.00]  I think all I can say is...
[2068.00 --> 2070.00]  Were you allowed to show it on camera?
[2070.00 --> 2072.00]  Well, they have pictures of it.
[2072.00 --> 2074.00]  I didn't show anything that no one's ever seen before.
[2074.00 --> 2075.00]  So, yeah.
[2075.00 --> 2077.00]  I can't imagine we'll get in too much trouble.
[2077.00 --> 2078.00]  I mean, what are they going to do?
[2078.00 --> 2080.00]  Tell us we can't have our Titan Blacks?
[2080.00 --> 2081.00]  They could do that.
[2081.00 --> 2082.00]  Ooh.
[2082.00 --> 2083.00]  Um...
[2083.00 --> 2084.00]  All right, so...
[2084.00 --> 2085.00]  That's never happened.
[2085.00 --> 2086.00]  Continue on with the show.
[2086.00 --> 2089.00]  Internet, please do not give us away.
[2089.00 --> 2091.00]  Please do not give us away.
[2091.00 --> 2092.00]  Oh.
[2092.00 --> 2094.00]  And without further...
[2094.00 --> 2096.00]  Whatever...
[2096.00 --> 2099.00]  This guyyyyyyyyyyyy.
[2099.00 --> 2100.00]  What's up, guys?
[2100.00 --> 2103.00]  Hey, welcome to the show, Barnacles.
[2103.00 --> 2104.00]  I'm back.
[2104.00 --> 2106.00]  Did you hear the one about the guy who lost his job?
[2106.00 --> 2108.00]  Oh, man.
[2108.00 --> 2109.00]  Wow.
[2109.00 --> 2114.00]  Guys, I about pissed myself when you said Barnacles edition with tears on the box.
[2114.00 --> 2116.00]  I lost it.
[2116.00 --> 2117.00]  Oh, my God.
[2117.00 --> 2118.00]  How are you doing, man?
[2118.00 --> 2120.00]  No, I'm hanging in there.
[2120.00 --> 2123.00]  You know, life's going to change a whole lot, but...
[2123.00 --> 2124.00]  Whoa, man, I'm moving around a lot.
[2124.00 --> 2125.00]  Okay.
[2125.00 --> 2127.00]  I'm doing all right, actually.
[2127.00 --> 2130.00]  I wasn't doing so good a couple days ago, but I'm doing all right.
[2130.00 --> 2131.00]  Here, I'm just gonna...
[2131.00 --> 2136.00]  I want to position you correctly so you're kind of a reasonable size, so...
[2136.00 --> 2139.00]  Well, okay, don't take that the wrong way.
[2139.00 --> 2141.00]  I leave my job every, like, three days.
[2141.00 --> 2142.00]  It's okay.
[2142.00 --> 2143.00]  I've been on the internet for a while.
[2143.00 --> 2145.00]  These fat joke things, I come to expect them.
[2145.00 --> 2146.00]  I get worried when they go away, actually.
[2146.00 --> 2149.00]  No, that wasn't even where I was going with that one.
[2149.00 --> 2150.00]  It slipped out, you know?
[2150.00 --> 2151.00]  I just...
[2151.00 --> 2153.00]  You skitties are all alike.
[2153.00 --> 2154.00]  Every one of you.
[2154.00 --> 2155.00]  Hey!
[2155.00 --> 2157.00]  So, tell me this.
[2157.00 --> 2158.00]  What's the plan?
[2158.00 --> 2161.00]  Well, the plan is, at this point, I've got time.
[2161.00 --> 2165.00]  I've got enough resources saved up to get me through, you know, I can...
[2165.00 --> 2168.00]  For about six months to a year, I'm thinking.
[2168.00 --> 2170.00]  So, I'm gonna go ahead and try to be my own boss.
[2170.00 --> 2171.00]  I'm gonna try to push the YouTube thing.
[2171.00 --> 2174.00]  I'm gonna try to work on my gaming company, Opulent Studios.
[2174.00 --> 2176.00]  Founded that with a bunch of friends.
[2176.00 --> 2177.00]  Want to get that back off the ground.
[2177.00 --> 2179.00]  And see where it takes me.
[2179.00 --> 2184.00]  If the internet rejects me and doesn't lovers me, well, then I'll probably have to go back to the corporate empire.
[2184.00 --> 2187.00]  So, that's the point.
[2187.00 --> 2188.00]  That's the point.
[2188.00 --> 2191.00]  So, you figure you've got a year worth of nest egg to develop, hey?
[2191.00 --> 2192.00]  That's...
[2192.00 --> 2193.00]  That's not bad.
[2193.00 --> 2194.00]  That's very doable.
[2194.00 --> 2195.00]  No, no.
[2195.00 --> 2196.00]  That's not bad.
[2196.00 --> 2197.00]  I mean, do you have enough to get some help?
[2197.00 --> 2206.00]  Or would you be trying to one-man army it a la Marcus Brownlee or, you know, a lot of those guys who have shown that you can have great success on YouTube even without an entire crew?
[2206.00 --> 2210.00]  Well, in the beginning, I'm gonna go it alone on the YouTube side.
[2210.00 --> 2212.00]  But on the development side, I've actually got a crew.
[2212.00 --> 2216.00]  I've got a graphics artist, another developer, and a PM that are all involved on the development side.
[2216.00 --> 2220.00]  So, I'm kind of gonna be working two different projects in two different corporations.
[2220.00 --> 2225.00]  The Barnacles nerdgasm thing will be just under me and the Opulent Studios will be under me and three other people.
[2225.00 --> 2230.00]  So, but as far as bringing somebody in on YouTube, that's not something that I'm, like, against.
[2230.00 --> 2237.00]  I mean, it's something that at some point I'm gonna have to do if it gets to the point where I need to create more than, say, like, one video a day, five days a week.
[2237.00 --> 2241.00]  I mean, at some point, I've got to be able to go do something else other than make videos.
[2241.00 --> 2244.00]  Yeah, you tell yourself that now.
[2244.00 --> 2246.00]  I'm already feeling the pressure, too.
[2246.00 --> 2249.00]  Let me tell you, not having a job to go to, it's hard to...
[2249.00 --> 2254.00]  I used to be able to come home and justify it and be like, ah, you know, I'm kind of tired, and I'm just gonna tweet out I'm not gonna make a video.
[2254.00 --> 2255.00]  It's fine.
[2255.00 --> 2259.00]  Now I'm like, wow, I sat at home for eight hours, and I didn't make a video.
[2259.00 --> 2260.00]  I didn't make a video.
[2260.00 --> 2268.00]  And you know, the funny thing is, you go and you hire people to supposedly, you know, help you make more videos or reduce your workload,
[2268.00 --> 2274.00]  and you just end up pouring it right back into production values or other projects or whatever else the case may be.
[2274.00 --> 2277.00]  Like, every time I find a way to alleviate some of the pressure...
[2277.00 --> 2283.00]  Like, this week, I had Nick, who's actually my sales guy, script an episode of Fast As Possible.
[2283.00 --> 2286.00]  He did a great job. The Ambient Occlusion video is coming out this weekend or Monday.
[2286.00 --> 2292.00]  And so I had him do that, and then I'm spending all of my time scripting a build guide.
[2292.00 --> 2295.00]  So it's like, I'll just find some other massive project.
[2295.00 --> 2301.00]  So the build guide was gonna be the build guide, and then I'm like, oh yeah, I've got a little bit more time to work on this.
[2301.00 --> 2308.00]  I'm gonna go get some Plasti Dip, and I'm gonna, like, figure out ways to really make this one pop.
[2308.00 --> 2310.00]  We're gonna take this build guide to the next level.
[2310.00 --> 2317.00]  Yeah, no, I definitely get that. I'm gonna have the same problem, because I'm used to taking all of the revenue the channel's generated thus far,
[2317.00 --> 2323.00]  and just dumping it back into camera equipment, lighting equipment, stuff for the cave, upgrades for the computers.
[2323.00 --> 2329.00]  And now I've got to figure out how to, like, somehow leverage that to support my family at the same time, is still maintaining that.
[2329.00 --> 2332.00]  So it's gonna be tricky. That's why I'm glad I have time to make it happen.
[2332.00 --> 2336.00]  It's not gonna happen overnight. I'm probably gonna drift into the red before I drift into the black.
[2336.00 --> 2339.00]  But, you know, I won't know unless I try, and it'll bug the hell out of me if I don't.
[2339.00 --> 2343.00]  You know what I'll say that I hope is really encouraging?
[2343.00 --> 2352.00]  Like, there have been exceptions. There have been the people who watched Linus Tech Tips before we, you know, sold out.
[2352.00 --> 2360.00]  Which is always funny to me, because these days I have far less reason to care if someone buys the product that I review
[2360.00 --> 2367.00]  than back when I worked at a company whose existence relied on people buying the products I was making videos about.
[2367.00 --> 2368.00]  Yeah.
[2368.00 --> 2373.00]  So if you trusted me then, you should probably trust me now, because it's not really any different.
[2373.00 --> 2378.00]  It's certainly not any worse. But there were the people who watched back then and haven't liked it
[2378.00 --> 2383.00]  since we started having to actually support ourselves and make a living off of this content.
[2383.00 --> 2392.00]  But by and large, the vast, vast majority of our viewers of our audience never skipped a beat and have continued to support us,
[2392.00 --> 2395.00]  no matter what it is we're doing, whether it's t-shirts or whatever else it is.
[2395.00 --> 2405.00]  So I would venture, I would hazard a guess that if you asked your community to step up and help support you now that you don't have a day job, they will probably do it.
[2405.00 --> 2409.00]  I'll agree with that. My community has been more supportive than I ever thought they would be.
[2409.00 --> 2413.00]  And to be honest, the morning that I was laid off, it was a complete surprise to me.
[2414.00 --> 2417.00]  You know, I was thinking about it and I was like, God, I need to go find another job.
[2417.00 --> 2420.00]  I absolutely have to go find another job. That whole day, that's all I could think of.
[2420.00 --> 2427.00]  And it wasn't until I saw the positive feedback that I got on Twitter, on Facebook, even on the comments on the video that I posted, I was surprised.
[2427.00 --> 2434.00]  I mean, it's got a, it got like a hundred dislikes to 12 or 14,000 likes and I've never had that kind of ratio before.
[2434.00 --> 2436.00]  So the community really knows how to come together.
[2436.00 --> 2441.00]  And, you know, as long as you're straight with them and you let them know what's going on, it seems like they're, they're cool with it.
[2441.00 --> 2446.00]  You're always going to have the trolls, no matter what, you're always going to have the trolls that come out and say, Oh my God, you're a sellout.
[2446.00 --> 2449.00]  You're doing this. Oh, you've changed. Oh, I don't like what you're doing now.
[2449.00 --> 2453.00]  That's, but that's always been there before I made it a career, you know?
[2453.00 --> 2458.00]  So I still expect that to be there, but by and large, I think the community is going to back me up.
[2458.00 --> 2459.00]  If they enjoy what I do, I'm going to keep doing it.
[2459.00 --> 2464.00]  And if they, if they decide they don't enjoy it anymore and the community starts to go away, well, then that's my sign.
[2464.00 --> 2468.00]  I probably shouldn't be in this business and I should go actually get a job, you know?
[2468.00 --> 2477.00]  Yep. A hundred percent agree. And I mean, I I've, I've messaged you privately saying, I think you're doing a great job in terms of developing your style, developing your delivery.
[2477.00 --> 2485.00]  Um, I think I gave you some feedback that wasn't quite as positive, but, uh, it was, it changed my direction a little bit though.
[2485.00 --> 2489.00]  If you notice my videos aren't 30 minutes long anymore.
[2489.00 --> 2498.00]  And you know, what's funny about it is no matter what, and, and you can listen to me or you can listen to someone else or whatever else, everyone's going to have a different idea for how you can run it.
[2498.00 --> 2507.00]  So if there's any advice that I can give you right now, it's tune out the advice, unless you really truly believe in your heart of hearts, that it's exactly what you need to be doing.
[2507.00 --> 2510.00]  Cause otherwise you'll go in a thousand different directions and you'll be spread so thin.
[2510.00 --> 2512.00]  It has to be his own channel too.
[2512.00 --> 2515.00]  Well, the nice thing about me is I've got the ADHD thing going on for me.
[2515.00 --> 2519.00]  So it's like all this advice pours in and just little pieces stick here and there and here and there.
[2519.00 --> 2521.00]  And I'm only capable of doing what I'm capable of doing.
[2521.00 --> 2523.00]  So that's, it's ultimately going to solve itself.
[2523.00 --> 2527.00]  Honestly, my first thought when I heard was his YouTube channel is actually pretty big.
[2527.00 --> 2529.00]  He can actually probably do this.
[2529.00 --> 2530.00]  Yep.
[2530.00 --> 2531.00]  I was actually pretty excited at the same time.
[2531.00 --> 2534.00]  When we went indie, we were three people.
[2534.00 --> 2542.00]  I had to support three people and we had around 250,000 subscribers and we were doing around 160,000 to 180,000 views a day.
[2542.00 --> 2546.00]  So you have to support one person on a subscriber number.
[2546.00 --> 2550.00]  That's, I don't know, whatever, two thirds, math's not my strong point.
[2550.00 --> 2555.00]  And view numbers that are in the sort of third-ish and maybe a little bit less range.
[2555.00 --> 2557.00]  You can do it for sure.
[2557.00 --> 2558.00]  Yeah. Yeah.
[2558.00 --> 2560.00]  And I'm trying to go in a unique direction with my channel.
[2560.00 --> 2561.00]  Like you guys know, it's been all over the map.
[2561.00 --> 2564.00]  I mean, you can find videos on how to put brakes on your car on my channel.
[2564.00 --> 2568.00]  I mean, they're there if you look for them, but realistically, I'm going to stick with the 3D printing stuff.
[2568.00 --> 2570.00]  I'm going to get heavily into development though.
[2570.00 --> 2572.00]  And that's a territory I haven't done before.
[2572.00 --> 2573.00]  Cause I want to keep my development skills sharp.
[2573.00 --> 2578.00]  I've been programming for 15 years and now I don't have a job to go and program every day.
[2578.00 --> 2583.00]  So I'm going to be working on games of opulent studios, but I'm also planning on doing a series of videos where I actually show people how to program.
[2583.00 --> 2588.00]  I'm going to start with a simple high level language like C sharp and show them how to write some cool little tools and utilities.
[2588.00 --> 2592.00]  And I think that that'll be kind of fun because I'm not going to go the conventional route of, oh, here's a tutorial.
[2592.00 --> 2594.00]  Watch me type in some stuff.
[2594.00 --> 2599.00]  I'm actually going to make it kind of funny and really screw around a whole bunch and try to try to captivate people and keep their attention.
[2599.00 --> 2604.00]  And the other thing is I, the reason a lot of people think that I, I over ham it up in my videos.
[2604.00 --> 2606.00]  I get this. They're like, man, you're trying to be funny.
[2606.00 --> 2609.00]  Then you've got to realize I am the slowest editor on earth.
[2609.00 --> 2613.00]  And the only way I can make it through three hours of editing is if I'm laughing at myself.
[2613.00 --> 2622.00]  So I, I intentionally ham it up so that when I'm editing the video, I'm sitting here at certain parts, pissing myself going, I really shouldn't leave that in there, but I'm going to, cause it made me laugh.
[2622.00 --> 2626.00]  Or I'll cut it out entirely, even though it made me laugh, but it keeps me entertained. And that's what gets me through it.
[2626.00 --> 2631.00]  When I did the boring, like unboxings, just open it. Like, Hey guys, here's what this is kind of cool. And everything.
[2631.00 --> 2636.00]  I had a really hard time editing that stuff. It wasn't until I started just kind of playing around a little bit that I, I had fun with it.
[2636.00 --> 2640.00]  And then, then, then you kind of see that come out in the video. You're like, Oh, you actually had fun making this.
[2640.00 --> 2646.00]  If you make fun, entertaining programming videos, that would actually be pretty cool.
[2646.00 --> 2651.00]  I know if you've ever seen a fun programming video, there's never, that's what I could find was.
[2651.00 --> 2661.00]  Ah, the new Boston or something. And he's like, every once in a blue moon, there's like a slightly edgy comment that might make you chuckle.
[2661.00 --> 2666.00]  That's like the, the, the most entertaining programming videos I've pretty much ever found.
[2666.00 --> 2670.00]  So if you can find something that actually makes me laugh and teaches me how to program, that would be really cool.
[2670.00 --> 2676.00]  Okay. So, so envision this. What if I did a video where it was like Bob Ross, you know, with like the push and here's the little tree.
[2676.00 --> 2680.00]  I'm going to be like, here's the little variable. And then I just keep going back to it. I'm like, here's this variable again.
[2680.00 --> 2683.00]  We're going to put a little symbol next to him. See, it makes them look cool.
[2683.00 --> 2688.00]  I think that's pretty funny. We're learning. It's a happy accident.
[2688.00 --> 2691.00]  Oh my God. Yeah, no, but I'm going to try, I'm going to try things out. I'm going to take risks.
[2691.00 --> 2697.00]  Like I said, I had time. If I didn't have time. And just to clarify, a lot of people think I'm taking a huge risk here for my family.
[2697.00 --> 2702.00]  Cause my son needs a lot of therapy. Realize I am not going to let my resources get exhausted.
[2702.00 --> 2708.00]  I will go back to an it job long before I'm in trouble. I'm not going to push this to the last minute and go, Oh crap.
[2708.00 --> 2712.00]  I screwed up. Let's go live under a bridge. Ain't going to happen. Yeah.
[2712.00 --> 2724.00]  All right. So speaking of screwing up and living under a bridge, um, if you steal in game items, one British MP, this was posted by Johners on the forum.
[2724.00 --> 2737.00]  One British MP thinks that you should go to jail or P find or community service or whatever real world consequences exist for real world crimes.
[2737.00 --> 2742.00]  He wants to see that happen to people who, uh, who steal things digitally.
[2742.00 --> 2752.00]  And we're not talking steal digitally, like what we're always hearing about stealing movies, stealing music, stealing windows,
[2752.00 --> 2757.00]  which you don't have to care about anymore. Um, no,
[2757.00 --> 2759.00]  actually I would care about it more than ever.
[2759.00 --> 2765.00]  We're talking stealing swords, like, like in game items and stuff like that.
[2765.00 --> 2771.00]  And not like, Oh, he ninja looted it. He picked it up off the ground before I could, or he like need rolled it when he didn't actually need it.
[2771.00 --> 2776.00]  Or hold on. You got to realize swords and games to some of these guys are like real items.
[2776.00 --> 2778.00]  Yeah. Yes, they are.
[2778.00 --> 2781.00]  Like I, I know, I know I have a friend who plays world of Warcraft and seriously,
[2781.00 --> 2785.00]  the, the way I see him scream in pain when something bad happens in that game,
[2785.00 --> 2789.00]  it's like, you might as well be like stealing his real stuff and like breaking his house and beating him with it.
[2789.00 --> 2793.00]  You know? And the thing about it is, and this is, this is something like for me personally,
[2793.00 --> 2796.00]  in game items are not something I've spent a ton of money on over the years.
[2796.00 --> 2799.00]  This is a fairly interesting thing. I'm going to interject before you can keep going.
[2799.00 --> 2805.00]  You can buy a Karambit in real life for cheaper than you can buy a Karambit in Counter-Strike.
[2805.00 --> 2807.00]  Wow, that's screwed up.
[2807.00 --> 2809.00]  Okay.
[2809.00 --> 2811.00]  So, originally,
[2811.00 --> 2813.00]  I'm selling them.
[2813.00 --> 2818.00]  Originally, Johnner's post on the forum was kind of mocking this as if, you know, ha ha ha, it's not real stuff.
[2818.00 --> 2829.00]  And as someone who, who doesn't spend a lot of money on in-game or digital items, I kind of, my initial knee-jerk reaction was,
[2829.00 --> 2840.00]  what, really? Go to jail for, you know, like, like get charged with grand theft for stealing $5,000 worth of, you know, boots in Diablo or whatever the case may be?
[2840.00 --> 2845.00]  And then I kind of stopped and thought about it for a second because is, is, is a digital currency?
[2845.00 --> 2850.00]  And we could just, let's just call in-game items. Let's call Team Fortress 2 Hats a digital currency.
[2850.00 --> 2851.00]  Are they not?
[2851.00 --> 2857.00]  Anything that can be converted to and from another currency and can be traded for goods and services between people is kind of a currency.
[2857.00 --> 2870.00]  So, is stealing digital currency that someone worked for, and if that work was farming gold or if that work was, you know, sitting at their desk trading stocks, is that any different?
[2870.00 --> 2873.00]  Is that currency any different from, from money?
[2873.00 --> 2875.00]  And I kind of started thinking about it going, well, shit.
[2875.00 --> 2880.00]  $5,000 of in-game boots is still $5,000.
[2880.00 --> 2881.00]  And that's still got stolen.
[2881.00 --> 2883.00]  I think this is a huge step in the right direction.
[2883.00 --> 2885.00]  So, sorry, I'm all done with my thoughts.
[2885.00 --> 2886.00]  Yours.
[2886.00 --> 2888.00]  No, I, I agree.
[2888.00 --> 2889.00]  I agree.
[2889.00 --> 2891.00]  I think, you know, I think people take that stuff very, very seriously.
[2891.00 --> 2897.00]  And it's one thing to get your items stolen in-game if you put yourself in harm's way, but to have hacking involved to take it.
[2897.00 --> 2900.00]  I mean, I really don't look at it any different than hacking a bank account and taking money out.
[2900.00 --> 2902.00]  I mean, you're definitely taking away something somebody worked for.
[2902.00 --> 2903.00]  Yeah.
[2903.00 --> 2907.00]  And we're not talking like you board their ship and you gank it.
[2907.00 --> 2908.00]  Right, right, right.
[2908.00 --> 2909.00]  We're talking like...
[2909.00 --> 2914.00]  You board their 1011 port and send some, an UUB packet and like knock it over and steal all their crap.
[2914.00 --> 2915.00]  Yeah.
[2915.00 --> 2916.00]  It's bad.
[2917.00 --> 2918.00]  I meant yoink.
[2918.00 --> 2919.00]  I said gank.
[2919.00 --> 2920.00]  I don't know how that slipped out.
[2920.00 --> 2921.00]  Yoink their shit?
[2921.00 --> 2922.00]  Yeah.
[2922.00 --> 2923.00]  Oh, see...
[2923.00 --> 2924.00]  Whatever.
[2924.00 --> 2927.00]  Like I was, I was going for the Simpsons thing and I was completely...
[2927.00 --> 2928.00]  Gank kinda works.
[2928.00 --> 2929.00]  That kind of works, but...
[2929.00 --> 2930.00]  Not fully.
[2930.00 --> 2932.00]  What I meant to say was yoink and I have no idea how that works.
[2932.00 --> 2935.00]  We all kinda let it slide because you're not that much of a gamer anyways.
[2935.00 --> 2936.00]  Because we were like, ahhh.
[2936.00 --> 2937.00]  Wow.
[2937.00 --> 2938.00]  Wow.
[2938.00 --> 2939.00]  Wow.
[2939.00 --> 2942.00]  You know what's funny is I can't, I can't beat the last level of Bioshock Infinite.
[2942.00 --> 2944.00]  But you can't beat it on a shield.
[2944.00 --> 2947.00]  No, I tried it on my computer last night.
[2947.00 --> 2948.00]  I'm only a quarter of the way through.
[2948.00 --> 2951.00]  I really need to finish that now that I actually like have time.
[2951.00 --> 2952.00]  And you know what?
[2952.00 --> 2954.00]  I'm more of a gamer these days than you give me credit for.
[2954.00 --> 2957.00]  I actually game a fair bit on Nvidia Shield.
[2957.00 --> 2959.00]  I played Bioshock Infinite.
[2959.00 --> 2962.00]  That's the most recent game that I've played in a long time.
[2962.00 --> 2965.00]  I'm more of a gamer these days than you give me credit for.
[2965.00 --> 2968.00]  I played Bioshock Infinite, that's the most recent game I've played.
[2968.00 --> 2969.00]  I started Limbo.
[2969.00 --> 2970.00]  And he played it for like 5 minutes.
[2970.00 --> 2972.00]  He started Limbo!
[2972.00 --> 2974.00]  I'm almost done Super Meat Boy.
[2974.00 --> 2977.00]  When are the release dates of all these games?
[2977.00 --> 2978.00]  I don't care.
[2978.00 --> 2980.00]  Not that that really matters, to be completely honest.
[2980.00 --> 2981.00]  I hate you.
[2981.00 --> 2984.00]  Anyway, the point is, do you have anything to add to the in-game items thing?
[2984.00 --> 2985.00]  No, I think it's awesome.
[2985.00 --> 2988.00]  I've seen a whole bunch of stuff like this happen.
[2988.00 --> 2990.00]  I know people that have had their accounts hacked.
[2990.00 --> 2991.00]  I've had my account hacked.
[2991.00 --> 2994.00]  I've had my account hacked and all my games stolen from Origin.
[2994.00 --> 2996.00]  It was a nightmare to get it all back.
[2996.00 --> 2997.00]  It took me like a week.
[2997.00 --> 3000.00]  At one point in time, my character in WoW was worth a lot of money.
[3000.00 --> 3006.00]  And my WoW account got hacked like many times, despite doing many precautions.
[3006.00 --> 3008.00]  It doesn't really seem to matter.
[3008.00 --> 3011.00]  Alright, so let's move on to the next thing.
[3011.00 --> 3018.00]  Valve had this controller idea that was like revolutionary and groundbreaking.
[3018.00 --> 3020.00]  We were going to have touchpads.
[3020.00 --> 3023.00]  Oh, I thought we were all going to do it now.
[3023.00 --> 3025.00]  Barnacles was doing it and then...
[3025.00 --> 3028.00]  Are we going for this?
[3028.00 --> 3029.00]  What are we doing?
[3029.00 --> 3030.00]  I'm confused.
[3030.00 --> 3031.00]  What kind of show is this?
[3031.00 --> 3032.00]  I don't know.
[3032.00 --> 3036.00]  The point is, Valve had this innovative controller idea with touchpads.
[3036.00 --> 3038.00]  And I kind of looked at it and I went,
[3038.00 --> 3039.00]  Okay.
[3039.00 --> 3040.00]  That's cool in theory.
[3040.00 --> 3042.00]  Let's see how this pans out.
[3042.00 --> 3049.00]  And I swear, every single revision to the Steam controller makes it closer and closer and closer to this.
[3049.00 --> 3052.00]  Which is the Shield controller.
[3052.00 --> 3055.00]  And I'm not saying that Valve was copying something that didn't exist yet.
[3055.00 --> 3060.00]  I'm saying that the Shield controller is not really inherently any different from an Xbox 360 controller.
[3060.00 --> 3064.00]  And so the closer it gets, the less innovative it is.
[3064.00 --> 3068.00]  And I just have to wonder if there's any point in them even continuing to develop this thing.
[3068.00 --> 3071.00]  If it's just eventually going to get rid of the touchpads even?
[3071.00 --> 3074.00]  Yeah, so the latest iteration...
[3074.00 --> 3077.00]  Here, sorry, I'm making Barnacles go away for a bit here.
[3077.00 --> 3078.00]  Sorry, sorry.
[3078.00 --> 3080.00]  We've got a couple shoulder buttons.
[3080.00 --> 3082.00]  We have a touchpad.
[3082.00 --> 3084.00]  There's those back buttons.
[3084.00 --> 3086.00]  Basically, everything's the same.
[3086.00 --> 3088.00]  They changed one of the directional pads with the joystick.
[3088.00 --> 3092.00]  Yes, so we've got a joystick and ABXY now.
[3092.00 --> 3094.00]  Which originally was not the case.
[3094.00 --> 3098.00]  I personally am starting to kind of like it.
[3098.00 --> 3106.00]  But I'm not a huge fan of both analog sticks being on the bottom.
[3106.00 --> 3109.00]  I'd prefer to have a D-pad here and an analog stick up here.
[3109.00 --> 3110.00]  Your thoughts?
[3110.00 --> 3112.00]  As I know how I hold it, I like having my analog stick...
[3112.00 --> 3114.00]  Be careful where you go with this sentence.
[3114.00 --> 3120.00]  I like having my analog stick on the top of the left side.
[3120.00 --> 3124.00]  Because I kind of like push it into my left hand, which makes my left hand go up a little bit.
[3124.00 --> 3126.00]  It's just because I've used an Xbox 360 controller for so long.
[3126.00 --> 3127.00]  Yeah.
[3127.00 --> 3128.00]  So I like it being up there.
[3128.00 --> 3131.00]  So this is still going to bug me unless I just use that touchpad all the time.
[3131.00 --> 3132.00]  Right.
[3132.00 --> 3135.00]  But then why would I use this controller?
[3135.00 --> 3136.00]  Jerry touchpads.
[3136.00 --> 3137.00]  I didn't know.
[3137.00 --> 3138.00]  Touchpads on game controllers.
[3138.00 --> 3141.00]  Honestly, I thought it was really cool when they first did it.
[3141.00 --> 3143.00]  And then I was like, nah, this isn't going to work.
[3143.00 --> 3145.00]  Because you don't have that precision.
[3145.00 --> 3149.00]  You just get used to using the thumb stick after so long.
[3149.00 --> 3157.00]  And when you pick up a controller, it's just having something you have to constantly keep picking your finger up and moving it back and dragging around and stuff would drive me absolutely crazy.
[3157.00 --> 3159.00]  Well, they demoed playing Portal.
[3159.00 --> 3165.00]  But then if you watch that demo, they weren't doing anything particularly complicated.
[3165.00 --> 3170.00]  I maintain that the only games that really makes a ton of sense for is stuff like Civ.
[3170.00 --> 3171.00]  And if it was going to be...
[3171.00 --> 3176.00]  Where it's like turn-based, kind of slow, where you can kind of sweep around and there's probably more things on screen.
[3176.00 --> 3182.00]  And if you were going to play Civ anyway, wouldn't you just get like a TV dinner stand and like a ducky mini?
[3182.00 --> 3183.00]  That would be much better.
[3183.00 --> 3184.00]  And a mouse?
[3184.00 --> 3185.00]  That would be much better.
[3185.00 --> 3187.00]  It really depends how the games are developed.
[3187.00 --> 3191.00]  But honestly, games are going to be developed either for a keyboard-mouse experience or for a controller experience.
[3191.00 --> 3198.00]  I mean, until they start specifically making game profiles that like suit thumb touchpads, it's going to feel awkward.
[3198.00 --> 3201.00]  And my thing is that the original design catered to...
[3201.00 --> 3203.00]  They're adding something to the market.
[3203.00 --> 3206.00]  So hopefully more games could be played in this situation.
[3206.00 --> 3215.00]  And now they're moving away from that to the point where before I was like, okay, maybe I could have this controller for those couple games where it makes a ton of sense.
[3215.00 --> 3220.00]  And now I'm like, no, I'll just probably stick to a 360 style controller and be fine.
[3220.00 --> 3222.00]  Yeah, I think what it comes down to is just what people are used to.
[3222.00 --> 3228.00]  I mean, you've been using the 360 controller and that style of controller for so long that it's going to be really hard to change over.
[3228.00 --> 3229.00]  It's just like keyboards, right?
[3229.00 --> 3232.00]  We all use the standard layout.
[3232.00 --> 3233.00]  We don't use Dvorak.
[3233.00 --> 3237.00]  You know, some people do, but it's like who wants to memorize a whole new format just to be a little bit faster.
[3237.00 --> 3244.00]  I switched to Dvorak actually, and I loved it, but it was a serious issue every single time I'd use someone else's computer.
[3244.00 --> 3245.00]  I bet.
[3245.00 --> 3251.00]  And that's what ended up making me drop it actually, because when I switched, I wasn't working.
[3251.00 --> 3253.00]  I was just going to school.
[3253.00 --> 3255.00]  And then when I started working again, I was in an IT shop.
[3255.00 --> 3260.00]  So people's computers would come in and I had to work on tons of different people's computers all the time.
[3260.00 --> 3261.00]  And it just drove me nuts.
[3261.00 --> 3263.00]  I couldn't memorize both different layers.
[3263.00 --> 3264.00]  Yeah.
[3264.00 --> 3267.00]  That's the problem with deviating from standards is you're on your own, right?
[3267.00 --> 3269.00]  I mean, once you do that, you're carrying your own keyboard everywhere.
[3269.00 --> 3270.00]  Yeah.
[3270.00 --> 3273.00]  If I only ever used my own keyboards, it would be fine.
[3273.00 --> 3277.00]  We had an intern once who brought his own keyboard to work every day.
[3277.00 --> 3279.00]  That's a hardcore intern right there.
[3279.00 --> 3282.00]  And he had a plastic cover for it that kept it dustproofed and everything.
[3282.00 --> 3283.00]  It was fantastic.
[3283.00 --> 3284.00]  He was badass.
[3284.00 --> 3285.00]  He didn't care about the mouse.
[3285.00 --> 3286.00]  Nope.
[3286.00 --> 3287.00]  Well, every computer I had at work was a mechanical keyboard.
[3287.00 --> 3293.00]  I bought mechanical keyboards for my two offices and my two workstations because I just couldn't stand those little membrane keyboards anymore.
[3293.00 --> 3296.00]  I have my own mechanical keyboards on all my stations now.
[3296.00 --> 3300.00]  Which is bizarre because we have so many mechanical keyboards here.
[3300.00 --> 3301.00]  Don't let me use any of them.
[3301.00 --> 3302.00]  Well, then you'll ruin them.
[3302.00 --> 3303.00]  You'll get them all my employees.
[3303.00 --> 3304.00]  It's a good investment for the workplace.
[3304.00 --> 3309.00]  It's a really good investment for the workplace because you can tell if people are working with mechanical keyboards.
[3309.00 --> 3310.00]  Because you can just kind of listen.
[3310.00 --> 3311.00]  It's like...
[3311.00 --> 3314.00]  That's a good point.
[3314.00 --> 3316.00]  All right.
[3316.00 --> 3318.00]  Everything else for Jill Cavs.
[3318.00 --> 3322.00]  Speaking of not being sure if anyone's working, the hard drive industry.
[3322.00 --> 3327.00]  So we first got four terabyte hard drives back in late 2011.
[3327.00 --> 3334.00]  And if you guys remember, leading up to that, we were getting new hard drive capacities like, what, every six months?
[3334.00 --> 3339.00]  We went from 320 to 640 to 500, 750s and one terabytes.
[3339.00 --> 3344.00]  And then we got one and a half terabytes, two terabytes, three terabytes, four terabytes, and then nothing!
[3344.00 --> 3348.00]  I still remember being at PAX having to explain to everybody what a terabyte was.
[3348.00 --> 3349.00]  Well, don't forget the six.
[3349.00 --> 3350.00]  Don't forget the six that was at Samsung.
[3350.00 --> 3351.00]  I think Samsung made a six.
[3351.00 --> 3352.00]  Was it Seagate or Samsung?
[3352.00 --> 3353.00]  I can't remember.
[3353.00 --> 3354.00]  I can't remember.
[3354.00 --> 3355.00]  I can't remember.
[3355.00 --> 3356.00]  Someone did.
[3356.00 --> 3361.00]  But the point is, we're finally seeing a big move all of a sudden.
[3361.00 --> 3369.00]  WD just released a red six terabyte, and then they went ahead and validated it for up to eight of them in a single enclosure.
[3369.00 --> 3376.00]  So we're talking 48 terabytes in a single eight bay enclosure, which is freaking unreal.
[3376.00 --> 3381.00]  And Seagate is apparently sampling eight and ten terabyte hard drives.
[3381.00 --> 3384.00]  So the original article is from DSL.SK.
[3384.00 --> 3389.00]  This is not like to end users or anything, but let's just have a brief discussion.
[3389.00 --> 3392.00]  What would you do with ten terabyte hard drives?
[3392.00 --> 3395.00]  I'd just back up the internet.
[3395.00 --> 3398.00]  I'd just back the whole thing up and then cancel my internet subscription, save some money.
[3398.00 --> 3399.00]  That's what I'd do.
[3399.00 --> 3401.00]  I guess you need to now, because...
[3401.00 --> 3402.00]  Oh, wow.
[3402.00 --> 3403.00]  You're a terrible person.
[3403.00 --> 3412.00]  I can see a lot of people buying two drives and raid wanting them instead of a huge set and raid wanting the queue.
[3412.00 --> 3413.00]  That's exactly what I'd do.
[3413.00 --> 3414.00]  So you could streamline them.
[3414.00 --> 3416.00]  You don't need massive hard drive arrays as hardcore.
[3416.00 --> 3420.00]  You won't need this full tower just because you want a lot of hard drives.
[3420.00 --> 3421.00]  Yeah.
[3421.00 --> 3425.00]  Well, my NAS setup is three external drive arrays that each hold four drives.
[3425.00 --> 3428.00]  So I could have a total of 12 of those ten terabytes.
[3428.00 --> 3429.00]  That'd be awesome.
[3429.00 --> 3430.00]  That'd be absolutely awesome.
[3430.00 --> 3438.00]  You know what's funny is I used to just kind of crave more storage and I was always trying to add more storage.
[3438.00 --> 3445.00]  Like, I got Windows Home Server v1, a project which I was super sad got just completely destroyed.
[3445.00 --> 3446.00]  You and me both.
[3446.00 --> 3447.00]  You and me both.
[3447.00 --> 3450.00]  I still run 2011 and I'm pissed off that they took out all the drive pool capability.
[3450.00 --> 3451.00]  Yeah.
[3451.00 --> 3455.00]  So drive pool was super cool and I would just add drives and add drives and add drives.
[3455.00 --> 3461.00]  And then I moved to 2011 and I finally went with a proper raid because that's what you have to do now.
[3461.00 --> 3462.00]  Yeah.
[3462.00 --> 3469.00]  And I built like a big fat raid and then I expanded it and that ended up being the server that now lives at our office and we use for that.
[3469.00 --> 3479.00]  And when I had to move something back to my house because I now had no NAS, what I realized was my personal data was only taking up about three and a half terabytes on it.
[3479.00 --> 3481.00]  I don't even know what people can.
[3481.00 --> 3484.00]  And that's mine, my wife's like we only have SSDs in our computers.
[3484.00 --> 3488.00]  So that's all the mass storage for everyone in my house.
[3488.00 --> 3490.00]  I can't figure out what people are putting on their NASes.
[3490.00 --> 3491.00]  I have a lot of data.
[3491.00 --> 3492.00]  I have a lot more than that.
[3492.00 --> 3493.00]  Yeah.
[3493.00 --> 3494.00]  For me, it's the raw image stuff.
[3494.00 --> 3501.00]  Like when I do photography in my family and stuff, like a single raw image I have can be 65 megabytes for just like one raw image.
[3501.00 --> 3506.00]  I back up a lot of the work I've done here on my own NAS.
[3506.00 --> 3511.00]  I back up like all my school stuff I've ever done all images game.
[3511.00 --> 3516.00]  I keep game installation files for old games where you'd like need the CD.
[3516.00 --> 3520.00]  Now, if it's not on Steam, essentially, those aren't that big.
[3520.00 --> 3522.00]  We're talking 650 meg files.
[3522.00 --> 3524.00]  We're talking 10 Barnacles photos.
[3524.00 --> 3525.00]  I have a lot.
[3525.00 --> 3526.00]  Right.
[3526.00 --> 3530.00]  And like, I'll be honest, I've never come close to filling up my storage.
[3530.00 --> 3533.00]  I mean, I still have 30% free and I'm already ready to go buy the next generation of drives.
[3533.00 --> 3540.00]  It's funny you guys are talking about this because I was going to go buy a whole bunch of the 6 terabyte Reds to replace my existing 1 and 2 terabyte drives that are in there.
[3540.00 --> 3547.00]  So what I'm planning to use the new high capacity drives for is I'm going to, because right now we have way too many drives.
[3547.00 --> 3552.00]  We have a 21 terabyte array that's made up of 3 terabyte drives that's in RAID 6.
[3552.00 --> 3557.00]  So there's 2 for redundancy there and then we have a couple hot spares just in case.
[3557.00 --> 3559.00]  Redundancy is a big deal.
[3559.00 --> 3560.00]  I'm sorry?
[3560.00 --> 3562.00]  No, I was saying redundancy is a big deal.
[3562.00 --> 3569.00]  I learned a bad lesson when I first set up my first Windows home server is, yeah, I wasn't replicating the data across any of the drives.
[3569.00 --> 3571.00]  And I lost some stuff that I'll never get back.
[3571.00 --> 3573.00]  And that's freaking horrible.
[3573.00 --> 3578.00]  So now everything in my house, I just consider half the storage is what I get because everything's redundant one way or another.
[3578.00 --> 3579.00]  Yeah.
[3579.00 --> 3584.00]  So I'll be using the new drives to build an offsite so that we can be doing a nightly sync to somewhere that's not here.
[3584.00 --> 3585.00]  Awesome.
[3585.00 --> 3590.00]  I was doing that for some essential stuff before with my home one, but it just doesn't have enough space on it.
[3590.00 --> 3595.00]  It's like kind of an older, not very many port raid card and I only have one terabyte drives for it.
[3595.00 --> 3597.00]  We don't actually have a ton of extra drives around here because...
[3597.00 --> 3599.00]  If you use them all.
[3599.00 --> 3602.00]  Yeah, we don't do a ton of hard drive reviews.
[3602.00 --> 3605.00]  No one's released anything in the last however many years.
[3605.00 --> 3606.00]  So what are we going to review?
[3606.00 --> 3610.00]  So we're not going to get review samples or anything and then like...
[3610.00 --> 3613.00]  And every time that there is a new hard drive, it's like, yay.
[3613.00 --> 3614.00]  Put it in the server.
[3614.00 --> 3616.00]  It's bigger a little bit.
[3616.00 --> 3618.00]  Yeah, so there's not much to say.
[3618.00 --> 3623.00]  But yeah, I guess all I would do with them, if I had two 10 terabyte drives, I would just go straight raid one.
[3623.00 --> 3625.00]  Two drives, raid one, done.
[3625.00 --> 3626.00]  That's what I mean, yeah.
[3626.00 --> 3630.00]  Because I don't need amazing write speeds for network attached storage.
[3630.00 --> 3633.00]  And then raid one, you do get a slight read speed benefit from it.
[3633.00 --> 3634.00]  So, great.
[3634.00 --> 3635.00]  Yeah.
[3635.00 --> 3641.00]  Like that single or double drive raid ones will be pretty sweet actually.
[3641.00 --> 3646.00]  Speaking of single or double drives, we have two sponsors for the show today.
[3646.00 --> 3651.00]  So sponsor number one is Intel's presence at...
[3651.00 --> 3652.00]  Hold on.
[3652.00 --> 3654.00]  I have my whole thing up here for it.
[3654.00 --> 3656.00]  At least I'm supposed to.
[3656.00 --> 3658.00]  I'm going to fire that guy.
[3658.00 --> 3659.00]  While you find the...
[3659.00 --> 3660.00]  Alright, so...
[3660.00 --> 3661.00]  Nope.
[3661.00 --> 3662.00]  ...intel's going to be at Nerd HQ.
[3662.00 --> 3665.00]  So I'm going to go ahead and screen share with you guys.
[3665.00 --> 3670.00]  Nerd HQ, they're going to have a presence there and they've got some cool stuff to go along with what they're doing.
[3670.00 --> 3674.00]  So first and foremost, they have an offer code right now.
[3674.00 --> 3682.00]  So from now until July 28th, you can get $25 off select Acer Stuff with promo code Nerd HQ25.
[3682.00 --> 3686.00]  Or get $50 off select Asus products with the code Nerd HQ50.
[3686.00 --> 3688.00]  These are very creative codes.
[3688.00 --> 3691.00]  For $25 off, it's got a $25 in it.
[3691.00 --> 3694.00]  And for $50 off, it's got a $50 in it.
[3694.00 --> 3699.00]  So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to post the bit.ly to where you can check out those deals.
[3699.00 --> 3702.00]  But while deals are cool, and they are.
[3702.00 --> 3703.00]  Deals are great.
[3703.00 --> 3704.00]  I love deals.
[3704.00 --> 3707.00]  Even better than deals is free stuff.
[3707.00 --> 3717.00]  So all you're going to do is tweet at Intel USA with hashtag Intel Nerd Scene for a chance to win a Core i7 processor.
[3717.00 --> 3721.00]  They actually didn't specify what Core i7 processor it is.
[3721.00 --> 3728.00]  But based on the fact that they say it has an estimated retail value of $1,000, I think we can guess.
[3728.00 --> 3730.00]  Probably an Extreme Edition.
[3730.00 --> 3731.00]  Very cool.
[3731.00 --> 3736.00]  On top of that, every tweet gets them to donate $1 for Operation Smile.
[3736.00 --> 3738.00]  So you should definitely do that.
[3738.00 --> 3740.00]  Even if you don't care about winning the processor.
[3740.00 --> 3750.00]  All you have to do is tweet why Comic Con makes you smile with hashtag Intel Nerd Scene at the Intel USA handle.
[3750.00 --> 3751.00]  Cost nothing.
[3751.00 --> 3754.00]  Each tweet is $1 up to a total of $5,000.
[3754.00 --> 3756.00]  So you can check out the full terms and conditions.
[3756.00 --> 3761.00]  I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to post that link into the Twitch chat right now.
[3761.00 --> 3764.00]  And then we also have another sponsor.
[3764.00 --> 3765.00]  Sponsor.
[3765.00 --> 3766.00]  Sponsor.
[3766.00 --> 3770.00]  I'm going to rely on Luke to go ahead and change it to our second lower third here.
[3770.00 --> 3771.00]  Okay.
[3771.00 --> 3772.00]  Good job Luke.
[3772.00 --> 3773.00]  You did well.
[3773.00 --> 3774.00]  You're hired.
[3774.00 --> 3775.00]  Why is it this?
[3775.00 --> 3776.00]  Why is it what?
[3776.00 --> 3777.00]  No.
[3777.00 --> 3778.00]  There we go.
[3778.00 --> 3779.00]  I failed.
[3779.00 --> 3780.00]  Wow.
[3780.00 --> 3783.00]  You're fired again.
[3783.00 --> 3784.00]  Crap.
[3784.00 --> 3785.00]  You're amazing.
[3785.00 --> 3786.00]  You're amazing.
[3786.00 --> 3787.00]  The poor actually.
[3787.00 --> 3788.00]  All right.
[3788.00 --> 3789.00]  Linda.com.
[3789.00 --> 3790.00]  You want to learn something cool.
[3790.00 --> 3794.00]  Aside from Linus Tech Tips, Linda.com is a great place to do it.
[3794.00 --> 3804.00]  So you can work on, you know, say video editing, DSLR photography, or video shooting, or any of the other skills that Barnacles needs now that he doesn't have a job anymore.
[3804.00 --> 3805.00]  I'll stab you, man.
[3805.00 --> 3806.00]  So Barnacles, Linda.com.
[3806.00 --> 3810.00]  Go to Linda.com slash Wancho for a free seven day trial.
[3810.00 --> 3813.00]  You know what's sad is I'm going to do that.
[3813.00 --> 3815.00]  Linda.com has very reasonable plans.
[3815.00 --> 3817.00]  They allow you to learn at your own pace.
[3817.00 --> 3819.00]  They have industry experts teaching them.
[3819.00 --> 3822.00]  It's all really amazing video tutorials.
[3822.00 --> 3827.00]  And the great thing about Linda.com, in fact, the greatest thing about Linda.com is one of our very own employees here.
[3827.00 --> 3829.00]  In fact, a couple of them really like it.
[3829.00 --> 3838.00]  But one of our very own employees uses the skills he learned with Linda.com to do his job as one of our video editors slash designers every single day.
[3838.00 --> 3839.00]  So it is a website.
[3839.00 --> 3842.00]  It is a product that we believe in very, very strongly.
[3842.00 --> 3844.00]  And they have a new feature.
[3844.00 --> 3845.00]  So this is cool.
[3845.00 --> 3850.00]  They have their what they're calling this is Linda.com made you a mixtape.
[3850.00 --> 3855.00]  So basically they made more than a hundred mixtapes.
[3855.00 --> 3858.00]  What they do is they have these expert playlists.
[3858.00 --> 3861.00]  So they have courses that are carefully chosen by their learning experts.
[3861.00 --> 3868.00]  It's in-depth coverage of some of the most popular subjects and they organize it into course lists.
[3868.00 --> 3869.00]  So you know what to watch next.
[3869.00 --> 3872.00]  So as much as you can use Linda as kind of a smorgasbord.
[3872.00 --> 3875.00]  And that wasn't a crack at Barnacles.
[3875.00 --> 3876.00]  Sorry.
[3876.00 --> 3877.00]  Oh my God.
[3877.00 --> 3878.00]  Stop.
[3878.00 --> 3882.00]  As much as they use Linda as you can use Linda.com as a smorgasbord.
[3882.00 --> 3885.00]  You can use one of these to really guide you through the learning process.
[3885.00 --> 3886.00]  So guys, check it out.
[3886.00 --> 3888.00]  Linda.com slash Wancho for a free seven day trial.
[3888.00 --> 3889.00]  Barnacles do it now.
[3889.00 --> 3890.00]  Welcome back.
[3890.00 --> 3891.00]  How are you?
[3891.00 --> 3897.00]  People are requesting that you teach C++ or C instead of C sharp.
[3897.00 --> 3898.00]  No, God.
[3898.00 --> 3899.00]  Okay.
[3899.00 --> 3901.00]  One, one thing you can't make C and C++ funny.
[3901.00 --> 3902.00]  Are we about to get a rant?
[3902.00 --> 3904.00]  I would love to hear it.
[3904.00 --> 3908.00]  Let's hear a programming rant about why one programming language is much funnier than the others.
[3908.00 --> 3909.00]  Please.
[3909.00 --> 3910.00]  Okay.
[3910.00 --> 3911.00]  Go.
[3911.00 --> 3914.00]  C and C++ require you to do all your own memory management and pointer precision logic and all
[3914.00 --> 3915.00]  that.
[3915.00 --> 3917.00]  It takes forever to get anywhere.
[3917.00 --> 3920.00]  I will personally watch if you do C and C++.
[3920.00 --> 3921.00]  All right.
[3921.00 --> 3922.00]  Screw it.
[3922.00 --> 3923.00]  I'm doing a C and C++.
[3923.00 --> 3924.00]  Yeah.
[3924.00 --> 3926.00]  I'm going to be like, all right, guys, we're going to do hello world and it'll be a four
[3926.00 --> 3927.00]  hour long.
[3927.00 --> 3928.00]  Damn it.
[3930.00 --> 3934.00]  I like C sharp because it's like in a hundred lines of code, you can like, you know, you
[3934.00 --> 3937.00]  can make something cool and C and C++, a hundred lines of code.
[3937.00 --> 3938.00]  Yeah.
[3938.00 --> 3939.00]  You can do hello world and like properly return something.
[3939.00 --> 3945.00]  Um, it's not that bad, but, but still, I, I just, I, I prefer language to higher level languages
[3945.00 --> 3947.00]  with rapid development and stuff, creating applications, stuff like that.
[3947.00 --> 3950.00]  If I'm not creating drivers, I'm not going to be using native code.
[3950.00 --> 3951.00]  Hmm.
[3951.00 --> 3952.00]  So yeah.
[3952.00 --> 3953.00]  That's how it's going to be.
[3953.00 --> 3954.00]  Fine.
[3954.00 --> 3955.00]  Yeah.
[3955.00 --> 3956.00]  Whatever.
[3956.00 --> 3957.00]  Whatever.
[3957.00 --> 3958.00]  I'm not doing Java.
[3958.00 --> 3959.00]  Okay.
[3959.00 --> 3960.00]  I'm not doing Java.
[3960.00 --> 3961.00]  I'm okay with that.
[3961.00 --> 3962.00]  No, actually I'll take that back.
[3962.00 --> 3963.00]  If I go work for Google, I will do Java.
[3963.00 --> 3964.00]  Just not right now.
[3964.00 --> 3967.00]  Oh, now we got everybody over here doing like doing C++.
[3967.00 --> 3968.00]  Nice.
[3968.00 --> 3969.00]  See how hello world.
[3969.00 --> 3970.00]  All right.
[3970.00 --> 3971.00]  Fine.
[3971.00 --> 3972.00]  Fine.
[3972.00 --> 3973.00]  God.
[3973.00 --> 3976.00]  Oh, Twitch chat.
[3976.00 --> 3977.00]  Okay.
[3977.00 --> 3978.00]  How I love them.
[3978.00 --> 3982.00]  I'm in the steam music beta thing with this.
[3982.00 --> 3983.00]  Wow.
[3983.00 --> 3984.00]  Good for you.
[3984.00 --> 3985.00]  You get a prize.
[3985.00 --> 3986.00]  Woo.
[3986.00 --> 3987.00]  I don't have to give high fives to more people.
[3987.00 --> 3988.00]  This guy is such a breaker.
[3988.00 --> 3989.00]  Everything is about you.
[3989.00 --> 3993.00]  And you're always so down on our guests being all insulting to them.
[3993.00 --> 3996.00]  That's no, I have not once insulted Barnacles.
[3996.00 --> 3998.00]  Nah, Linus just keeps making me hungry.
[3998.00 --> 4000.00]  He said smorgasbord and I was like, mmm.
[4000.00 --> 4001.00]  Yeah.
[4001.00 --> 4003.00]  I can actually go for that thing.
[4003.00 --> 4005.00]  Hey, I wanted to ask you guys about something.
[4005.00 --> 4008.00]  Earlier you were talking about the water cooling stuff that you're going to do.
[4008.00 --> 4009.00]  The whole room water cooling.
[4009.00 --> 4010.00]  Yeah.
[4010.00 --> 4013.00]  I was thinking you guys should put a kiddie pool outside of the reservoir with a curtain
[4013.00 --> 4014.00]  on it and a shower.
[4014.00 --> 4017.00]  And literally just before the rads put the shower.
[4017.00 --> 4020.00]  So you can just go out there and have a nice, you know, heated shower all the time.
[4020.00 --> 4023.00]  And then it would pick it up, run it through the rads, pull the heat, and then loop it back through.
[4023.00 --> 4024.00]  That would be awesome.
[4024.00 --> 4025.00]  That would make the funniest video ever.
[4025.00 --> 4028.00]  Imagine having to clean and decontaminate that loop.
[4028.00 --> 4031.00]  Yeah, can you imagine having like ball sack gunk in your water block?
[4031.00 --> 4032.00]  No, no, it's okay.
[4032.00 --> 4034.00]  Just put a filter in there on your loop.
[4034.00 --> 4039.00]  You said you have an industrial pump, so just put yourself like one of those microbial filters on it and you'll be fine.
[4039.00 --> 4042.00]  You know how those at like Junk Face commercials say?
[4042.00 --> 4043.00]  Junk loop.
[4043.00 --> 4046.00]  Just don't use clear tubing.
[4046.00 --> 4049.00]  You don't want to see little floaties flying through there.
[4049.00 --> 4050.00]  Oh my God.
[4050.00 --> 4052.00]  It's like, yeah, my GPU is overheating.
[4052.00 --> 4054.00]  There's a pube in it.
[4054.00 --> 4055.00]  Oh.
[4055.00 --> 4056.00]  You said it.
[4056.00 --> 4057.00]  You said it.
[4057.00 --> 4059.00]  Hey, I showed restraint there.
[4059.00 --> 4060.00]  Oh my God.
[4060.00 --> 4061.00]  That'd be so funny.
[4061.00 --> 4064.00]  You'd like take your water block apart and there's like a cat ball here.
[4064.00 --> 4065.00]  Oh my God.
[4065.00 --> 4066.00]  Oh.
[4066.00 --> 4071.00]  No, actually loop contamination was one of the big things I was worried about with that project
[4071.00 --> 4078.00]  because I actually, I found other projects where people had gotten the notion, and it's
[4078.00 --> 4083.00]  a mistaken notion, but had gotten the notion that having a very large reservoir will make
[4083.00 --> 4085.00]  your loop run cooler.
[4085.00 --> 4090.00]  What it does is it makes your loop take longer to reach equilibrium, but your temps will not
[4090.00 --> 4095.00]  be appreciably lower unless your reservoir is also a heat dissipation device.
[4095.00 --> 4098.00]  Especially when we're running so many systems in the earth.
[4098.00 --> 4101.00]  So if you had aluminum fins on it or something like that, where it was actually cooling the
[4101.00 --> 4103.00]  water in it, then that does something.
[4103.00 --> 4107.00]  Otherwise, you're just creating a much longer delay while the water heats up.
[4107.00 --> 4111.00]  So I found a couple projects where people were using things like five gallon pails for
[4111.00 --> 4113.00]  their liquid cooling reservoirs.
[4113.00 --> 4118.00]  And one of those guys, I mean, again, we're talking people who think that the reservoir will
[4118.00 --> 4119.00]  cool the loop.
[4119.00 --> 4121.00]  So they're not doing their research.
[4121.00 --> 4123.00]  Like, I'm not saying that's a stupid assumption.
[4123.00 --> 4127.00]  I thought that at one point until I did my research and found out it doesn't work that
[4127.00 --> 4128.00]  way.
[4128.00 --> 4129.00]  But we're talking people who didn't do a lot of research.
[4129.00 --> 4133.00]  But anyway, one of these guys said he had enough gunk growing in his loop within two
[4133.00 --> 4138.00]  weeks that his pump was not able to move any water through CPU plot.
[4138.00 --> 4141.00]  Just to clarify, for anyone who wants to do a mineral oil build, you still need a fair
[4141.00 --> 4142.00]  amount of volume in your tank.
[4142.00 --> 4143.00]  Yeah.
[4143.00 --> 4144.00]  Yeah.
[4144.00 --> 4146.00]  Don't just be like, oh, I don't need that much.
[4146.00 --> 4147.00]  It's okay.
[4147.00 --> 4148.00]  Yeah.
[4148.00 --> 4154.00]  Speaking of mineral oil cooled machines, our mineral oil kit from Puget Systems has shipped
[4154.00 --> 4155.00]  and our...
[4155.00 --> 4156.00]  I think it's here.
[4156.00 --> 4157.00]  ...12 gallon...
[4157.00 --> 4158.00]  Oh, it arrived?
[4158.00 --> 4159.00]  I think so.
[4159.00 --> 4162.00]  Oh, well, our 12 gallon thing of mineral oil has also shipped.
[4162.00 --> 4163.00]  Oh, I don't think that arrived.
[4163.00 --> 4164.00]  No, that's not here.
[4164.00 --> 4166.00]  I shipped it to the US and then transferred it up.
[4166.00 --> 4167.00]  Okay.
[4167.00 --> 4172.00]  So we are going to be doing, for better or for worse, an MATX mineral oil cooled machine.
[4172.00 --> 4173.00]  Nice.
[4173.00 --> 4175.00]  Wish us so much luck.
[4175.00 --> 4177.00]  Are you guys just going to fully submerge the whole thing?
[4177.00 --> 4178.00]  I'm sorry?
[4178.00 --> 4179.00]  Are you going to fully submerge everything?
[4179.00 --> 4180.00]  You betcha.
[4180.00 --> 4181.00]  Except for the hard drive?
[4181.00 --> 4182.00]  The hard drive you can't though, right?
[4182.00 --> 4183.00]  No.
[4183.00 --> 4185.00]  There's no hard drive positioning in this tank configuration anyways.
[4185.00 --> 4186.00]  Okay.
[4186.00 --> 4190.00]  Because the store I used to work at like 15 years ago, they literally had a fish aquarium
[4190.00 --> 4193.00]  they just filled with mineral oil and everything's just dumped in there.
[4193.00 --> 4194.00]  Like they didn't even do it nicely.
[4194.00 --> 4198.00]  They just dumped the motherboard, dumped the power supply, all the fans spin it like one RPM
[4198.00 --> 4199.00]  and it just works.
[4199.00 --> 4200.00]  It's crazy.
[4200.00 --> 4201.00]  That's fantastic.
[4201.00 --> 4202.00]  Yeah.
[4202.00 --> 4203.00]  Yeah.
[4203.00 --> 4206.00]  Especially with their kits, it's like honestly a lot easier than you'd think.
[4206.00 --> 4211.00]  Cause you just build it on the plate they have and then slide it in and then pour oil
[4211.00 --> 4212.00]  in and you're done.
[4212.00 --> 4213.00]  Okay.
[4213.00 --> 4214.00]  How do you even clean that though?
[4214.00 --> 4216.00]  Like if you ever wanted to take that out and upgrade it, I mean, do you just call the
[4216.00 --> 4218.00]  loss as soon as you dip it in there?
[4218.00 --> 4219.00]  You're on.
[4219.00 --> 4223.00]  Basically, it's going to take you forever to dry out the component.
[4223.00 --> 4229.00]  If it's something like a graphics card that has a sticker on it, which is less common these days, but was very common back when I did it.
[4229.00 --> 4230.00]  That sticker will come off.
[4230.00 --> 4234.00]  Anything that's rubber will probably deteriorate, die and particle away.
[4234.00 --> 4237.00]  But most things will work.
[4237.00 --> 4242.00]  Some things that you have to pay attention to is stuff like thermal paste could be kind of grabbed away from it.
[4242.00 --> 4246.00]  So if you take it out of the oil, you have to make sure that you re-thermal paste pretty much everything.
[4246.00 --> 4247.00]  Wow.
[4247.00 --> 4259.00]  And you're probably going to have to drip dry your stuff for a long time unless you feel like sacrificing bottles and bottles of some type of non-conductive solution that you can clean all the oil off with.
[4259.00 --> 4262.00]  Like isopropyl alcohol or something like that.
[4262.00 --> 4273.00]  But you have to be careful with those too because some of the ones that I've seen people suggest are really aggressive and can like eat away at metals and stuff, which is not good for your components.
[4273.00 --> 4276.00]  So be careful about what you're going to wash it with.
[4276.00 --> 4277.00]  The way I did it was I just drip dry everything.
[4277.00 --> 4282.00]  And everything worked except for my graphics card because I forgot to redo the thermal paste and test it and then it died.
[4282.00 --> 4283.00]  But everything else worked.
[4283.00 --> 4286.00]  So basically, I have a sacrificial graphics card that we're going to use.
[4286.00 --> 4291.00]  I have an old 5870 iFinity 6 edition that has a Spitfire cooler on it.
[4291.00 --> 4292.00]  So it's got a nice big cooler.
[4292.00 --> 4298.00]  So we could probably actually do it with no fan on anything like just oil flow.
[4298.00 --> 4301.00]  Fans are good because it pushes the oil.
[4301.00 --> 4306.00]  I know, but it's a very, very large cooler and it extends away from the graphics card itself.
[4306.00 --> 4308.00]  Yeah, I think I remember that cooler.
[4308.00 --> 4309.00]  Yeah, it might be okay.
[4309.00 --> 4311.00]  I mean, we'll try it and see how it goes and then we'll go from there.
[4311.00 --> 4313.00]  But yeah, it should be pretty cool, hey?
[4313.00 --> 4314.00]  Yeah.
[4314.00 --> 4317.00]  And we have an entire box of like tower heat sinks.
[4317.00 --> 4318.00]  Yeah.
[4318.00 --> 4320.00]  And those are going to be the best for that situation anyway.
[4320.00 --> 4328.00]  Unless I've seen some people started screwing around with putting like AIO liquid coolers and just hanging the radiator outside of the thing.
[4328.00 --> 4332.00]  So you have an individual cooler for the CPU and then you cool everything else with oil?
[4332.00 --> 4333.00]  Don't ask.
[4333.00 --> 4334.00]  I didn't.
[4334.00 --> 4345.00]  The coolest one that I've seen was somebody took a foam box and they filled it with mineral oil and then they took the condenser out of one of those little windows AC units and just set it on the top and had a pump just circulating the liquid over the top of the condenser.
[4345.00 --> 4348.00]  And it was just keeping it like almost freezing.
[4348.00 --> 4350.00]  That's fantastic.
[4350.00 --> 4355.00]  And it would be easy to find a window air conditioner that you could just cannibalize for something like that.
[4355.00 --> 4356.00]  I'll be back in a moment.
[4356.00 --> 4358.00]  Do you want to do the Steam music topic?
[4358.00 --> 4359.00]  Sure, sure.
[4359.00 --> 4361.00]  Make sure you screen share with them and stuff.
[4361.00 --> 4362.00]  Yeah.
[4362.00 --> 4363.00]  You know how to do it, right?
[4363.00 --> 4364.00]  Here, let's just switch laptops for a second.
[4364.00 --> 4365.00]  Windows P.
[4365.00 --> 4367.00]  We'll switch our identical looking laptops.
[4367.00 --> 4368.00]  Hooray.
[4368.00 --> 4369.00]  Oh, oh.
[4369.00 --> 4370.00]  There you go.
[4370.00 --> 4378.00]  Alright, so the Steam music interface beta isn't like that much of a looker and there isn't a ton of support for different formats.
[4378.00 --> 4382.00]  So they haven't actually added any support from when it was just in Steam big picture.
[4382.00 --> 4385.00]  So as of right now it supports stuff like MP3.
[4385.00 --> 4387.00]  And that's it.
[4387.00 --> 4395.00]  And they have a quote on their website that says, unless you're a big fan of the play button, you may not find your favorite music feature exists here yet.
[4395.00 --> 4404.00]  So there isn't a ton of features, but what is actually really cool, I'm excited for you to show this, is the fact that you can play it and mess around with it in the Steam overlay.
[4404.00 --> 4414.00]  So for me, I don't know if this is the default buttons, but for me it's just shift tab and it brings up the Steam overlay and I can change what music I have and what music I'm playing and all that kind of stuff, which is kind of great.
[4414.00 --> 4415.00]  It looks very simple.
[4415.00 --> 4417.00]  So I'm going to bring it up here in one second.
[4417.00 --> 4418.00]  Windows P.
[4418.00 --> 4419.00]  Oh, geez.
[4419.00 --> 4420.00]  Or duplicate.
[4420.00 --> 4421.00]  Duplicate.
[4421.00 --> 4425.00]  Wow, you field stripped that quick.
[4425.00 --> 4430.00]  So this is essentially what it looks like.
[4430.00 --> 4438.00]  So if you're in your library window in your dropdown, instead of selecting games, you just select music and then it just has a list of all your music.
[4438.00 --> 4443.00]  And then this player right here, this one individual pop up is essentially the player that you get.
[4443.00 --> 4444.00]  Extremely simple.
[4444.00 --> 4448.00]  There's no way as of right now, as far as I can tell, to add all of your music to a queue.
[4448.00 --> 4449.00]  It only works with MP3s.
[4449.00 --> 4451.00]  There's almost no features.
[4451.00 --> 4452.00]  It has shuffle.
[4452.00 --> 4453.00]  It has shuffle as the album that you're playing.
[4453.00 --> 4456.00]  So basically it has all the features of an iPod shuffle.
[4456.00 --> 4458.00]  MP3 or go home, man.
[4458.00 --> 4460.00]  Doesn't iPod shuffle have shuffle all?
[4460.00 --> 4462.00]  I don't know.
[4462.00 --> 4464.00]  I never had one because they were dumb.
[4464.00 --> 4465.00]  Me neither.
[4465.00 --> 4466.00]  I didn't have one.
[4466.00 --> 4467.00]  Okay.
[4467.00 --> 4474.00]  But yeah, so it's not a ton of features, but the whole idea of it right now is that they're trying to get feature suggestions from the community.
[4474.00 --> 4477.00]  So send them suggestions and they'll try and figure it out.
[4477.00 --> 4478.00]  All right.
[4478.00 --> 4481.00]  So, uh, you mean like this one?
[4481.00 --> 4482.00]  Yeah.
[4482.00 --> 4485.00]  Oh, it's heavy.
[4485.00 --> 4486.00]  All right.
[4486.00 --> 4489.00]  So there's my compressor over there.
[4489.00 --> 4491.00]  Why do you just have this laying around?
[4491.00 --> 4492.00]  I'm sorry?
[4492.00 --> 4494.00]  Why do you just have this laying around?
[4494.00 --> 4498.00]  Well, I used this for my old chilled liquid system.
[4498.00 --> 4505.00]  I had an E6600 that I think I had at 4 GHz 24-7 stable.
[4505.00 --> 4507.00]  I think that was the frequency I had it running at.
[4507.00 --> 4508.00]  Wow.
[4508.00 --> 4515.00]  And I actually had this mounted to a, like a cooler, like an icebox cooler.
[4515.00 --> 4522.00]  I had this mounted to that on like a thing underneath my case so that it could be mounted all the time.
[4522.00 --> 4524.00]  I had the whole thing insulated.
[4524.00 --> 4528.00]  So my CPU load temps were in the sub-teen degrees.
[4528.00 --> 4530.00]  Um, full load.
[4530.00 --> 4531.00]  That's awesome.
[4531.00 --> 4536.00]  It looks like you even custom mounted some 120mm fans on there too to replace the big huge one.
[4536.00 --> 4546.00]  If by custom mounting you mean zip ties and all the, uh, all the Silverstone 120mms that I salvaged from customer builds, then yes.
[4546.00 --> 4553.00]  So basically I used to build all of the, of the super high end liquid cooled systems at NCIX.
[4553.00 --> 4556.00]  And those systems were all in Silverstone TJ07.
[4556.00 --> 4561.00]  So that case came with a couple of 120mm fans in the basement.
[4561.00 --> 4571.00]  But most of the time I would end up ripping those out and replacing them with some other high end fan because these were customers buying 3000, 4000, 5000, 5000, $7000 machines.
[4571.00 --> 4572.00]  Right.
[4572.00 --> 4574.00]  And most of them didn't care.
[4574.00 --> 4577.00]  So I was like, when people would pick up the systems, a lot of them were local orders.
[4577.00 --> 4579.00]  I'd be like, yo, can I hold onto these fans?
[4579.00 --> 4588.00]  So over the years I, I have lost more of this model of fan than probably most people have ever owned of any fan.
[4588.00 --> 4589.00]  Wow.
[4589.00 --> 4590.00]  It's pretty insane.
[4590.00 --> 4591.00]  So yeah.
[4591.00 --> 4593.00]  You have to repurpose that for the mineral oil build.
[4593.00 --> 4594.00]  You have to.
[4594.00 --> 4598.00]  I bet I could repurpose it for the whole room.
[4598.00 --> 4600.00]  No, we probably shouldn't do that.
[4600.00 --> 4604.00]  If the idea is to try to not kick heat, I mean, we could mount it to the roof.
[4604.00 --> 4605.00]  We could mount it to the roof.
[4605.00 --> 4610.00]  The only problem is with it, if you mounted it outside, you wouldn't have that cool air return.
[4610.00 --> 4612.00]  So the, I don't know how efficient the condenser would be.
[4612.00 --> 4614.00]  Cause I mean the whole window unit, right.
[4614.00 --> 4618.00]  Is you have all the heat exhausting outside and then it's circulating the cool air inside over the condenser.
[4618.00 --> 4620.00]  I just don't know how much heat you'd be able to get rid of.
[4620.00 --> 4622.00]  You just keep recycled, recycling that heated air.
[4622.00 --> 4624.00]  You'd have to duck the hell out of it.
[4624.00 --> 4625.00]  Mm hmm.
[4625.00 --> 4628.00]  But inside it would work great for that mineral oil build.
[4628.00 --> 4629.00]  That would just be cool.
[4629.00 --> 4630.00]  Mm hmm.
[4630.00 --> 4631.00]  Do it.
[4631.00 --> 4635.00]  I don't know if it's worth it going with like the smallest mineral oil case.
[4635.00 --> 4636.00]  Cause we wanted to make it.
[4636.00 --> 4637.00]  Yeah.
[4637.00 --> 4638.00]  No, no, no.
[4638.00 --> 4639.00]  And this has like leaves on it and stuff.
[4639.00 --> 4642.00]  So if we went with the pretty dirty,
[4642.00 --> 4643.00]  it would be fine, dude.
[4643.00 --> 4644.00]  All right.
[4644.00 --> 4645.00]  I'm going to go.
[4645.00 --> 4646.00]  I'm going to go put this thing away.
[4646.00 --> 4647.00]  Cause it's extremely heavy.
[4647.00 --> 4648.00]  Uh, what else we got?
[4648.00 --> 4650.00]  We have, I can jump to the Microsoft topic.
[4650.00 --> 4651.00]  Yeah, sure.
[4651.00 --> 4652.00]  Just to make it super awkward.
[4652.00 --> 4653.00]  Ooh.
[4653.00 --> 4654.00]  Yay.
[4654.00 --> 4659.00]  So your favorite person in the world has decided to,
[4659.00 --> 4663.00]  that he's going to be merging all separate versions of windows into one.
[4663.00 --> 4664.00]  Yes.
[4664.00 --> 4670.00]  So essentially they're bringing the like windows, desktop windows, phone,
[4670.00 --> 4674.00]  and Xbox teams all together into one little group.
[4674.00 --> 4678.00]  And that one team will be streamlining the next version of windows from all
[4678.00 --> 4680.00]  these three operating systems into one.
[4680.00 --> 4681.00]  Yeah.
[4681.00 --> 4682.00]  It's what it sounds like.
[4682.00 --> 4685.00]  And to be honest, if they do it right, I think that's the right direction to go.
[4685.00 --> 4688.00]  Cause I think it's just too hard to maintain three completely different
[4688.00 --> 4689.00]  operating systems.
[4689.00 --> 4695.00]  I mean, so it, it, it makes sense, but as far as yeah, the, the layoffs don't make sense.
[4695.00 --> 4697.00]  Cause it's like, you still need all that intellectual property.
[4697.00 --> 4698.00]  I don't get it.
[4698.00 --> 4699.00]  Yeah.
[4699.00 --> 4700.00]  I don't really understand.
[4700.00 --> 4705.00]  Well, the issue I have with this idea is that we're assuming that Microsoft, the company
[4705.00 --> 4712.00]  that brought us the Metro UI, um, when they were only trying to converge two screens,
[4712.00 --> 4714.00]  It's going to be able to converge all of these together.
[4714.00 --> 4719.00]  It's going to be able to do what Apple decided was impossible when they developed a completely
[4719.00 --> 4721.00]  new operating system called iOS.
[4721.00 --> 4722.00]  Good luck.
[4722.00 --> 4727.00]  This, this, this is why I say if, if they do it right, I agree.
[4727.00 --> 4728.00]  If.
[4728.00 --> 4735.00]  Cause no offense to Microsoft, but Apple knows UI a lot better than they do, or has demonstrated
[4735.00 --> 4741.00]  over the years that they've been more progressively minded in terms of UI than Microsoft.
[4741.00 --> 4746.00]  One thing that I'm hoping is going to happen is that it's not a UI convergence necessarily.
[4746.00 --> 4747.00]  Okay.
[4747.00 --> 4751.00]  So it's a different, it's a different skin over top of the same background.
[4751.00 --> 4756.00]  No, because they're, they're, if you go to the basically exact same announcement that
[4756.00 --> 4759.00]  they made in April, which is where they're doing universal apps.
[4759.00 --> 4764.00]  If they just stick with the universal apps thing, have everyone working together so that
[4764.00 --> 4768.00]  the UIs feel the same, like so that the idea is the same.
[4768.00 --> 4772.00]  So that different menus will give you the same options and stuff like that, but they
[4772.00 --> 4774.00]  aren't exactly the same.
[4774.00 --> 4775.00]  I think that would be good.
[4775.00 --> 4776.00]  Okay.
[4776.00 --> 4777.00]  So here's the problem.
[4777.00 --> 4780.00]  I'm going to show you, I'm going to show you what, Microsoft, I'm going to show you
[4780.00 --> 4781.00]  what the problem is.
[4781.00 --> 4782.00]  Okay.
[4782.00 --> 4784.00]  So problem probably here, hold on.
[4784.00 --> 4785.00]  We got a screen share with me.
[4785.00 --> 4786.00]  We got a screen share with me.
[4786.00 --> 4793.00]  The problem is that if you have something that's sharing features or sharing resources between
[4793.00 --> 4798.00]  a couple of different iterations of the same thing, then you end up with this.
[4798.00 --> 4799.00]  Oh no.
[4799.00 --> 4800.00]  So hold on.
[4800.00 --> 4801.00]  Oh my.
[4801.00 --> 4802.00]  What are you going to wreck now?
[4802.00 --> 4803.00]  Hold on.
[4803.00 --> 4805.00]  How do I even open the Metro UI on this?
[4805.00 --> 4806.00]  There we go.
[4806.00 --> 4807.00]  All right.
[4807.00 --> 4808.00]  So I'm going to go ahead.
[4808.00 --> 4809.00]  Hit the magical windows key.
[4809.00 --> 4810.00]  It's magical.
[4810.00 --> 4811.00]  No, no, it's disabled.
[4811.00 --> 4812.00]  It's disabled on this one.
[4812.00 --> 4814.00]  So if I can even get, there we go.
[4814.00 --> 4816.00]  Stupid thing will even open.
[4816.00 --> 4820.00]  So I want to say for example, no, no, no, no, no.
[4820.00 --> 4821.00]  Right, right, right.
[4821.00 --> 4822.00]  I remember what I was trying to do.
[4822.00 --> 4823.00]  Okay.
[4823.00 --> 4824.00]  We'll get there eventually everyone.
[4824.00 --> 4825.00]  We'll get there eventually.
[4825.00 --> 4826.00]  So users.
[4826.00 --> 4827.00]  Okay.
[4827.00 --> 4832.00]  So I want to, I want to edit user accounts or something.
[4832.00 --> 4833.00]  What, what?
[4833.00 --> 4835.00]  Why can't I do it?
[4835.00 --> 4836.00]  Wait, what?
[4836.00 --> 4837.00]  Why can't I change my password?
[4837.00 --> 4838.00]  Why can't I do it?
[4838.00 --> 4839.00]  Oh, wait, what?
[4839.00 --> 4840.00]  What are you talking about?
[4840.00 --> 4841.00]  That's the most intuitive UI ever.
[4841.00 --> 4842.00]  Just look at that majestic thing right there.
[4842.00 --> 4843.00]  What?
[4843.00 --> 4844.00]  I mean, I'm in here now.
[4844.00 --> 4845.00]  What?
[4845.00 --> 4846.00]  Hold on a second.
[4846.00 --> 4847.00]  What, what, what, what, what?
[4847.00 --> 4848.00]  Why am I in here?
[4848.00 --> 4849.00]  What's going on?
[4849.00 --> 4850.00]  Learn to Windows, dude.
[4850.00 --> 4851.00]  Learn to Windows.
[4851.00 --> 4852.00]  I know, right?
[4852.00 --> 4854.00]  And then, and then, and then hold on, hold on, hold on.
[4854.00 --> 4855.00]  No, it gets better.
[4855.00 --> 4856.00]  It gets better.
[4856.00 --> 4859.00]  So I go into here and I'm like, oh yeah, well, hey, I want to,
[4859.00 --> 4861.00]  you know, resolution.
[4861.00 --> 4863.00]  I want to change my resolution or something.
[4863.00 --> 4864.00]  So, okay.
[4864.00 --> 4865.00]  I'll actually.
[4865.00 --> 4869.00]  Hey, it's intentionally obfuscated so only power users can figure it out.
[4869.00 --> 4870.00]  Dang it.
[4870.00 --> 4871.00]  You know what?
[4871.00 --> 4875.00]  The stupid thing here is I actually, I had an example that I remembered
[4875.00 --> 4878.00]  where within Metro UI, it dumps you back to the desktop.
[4878.00 --> 4879.00]  Can't remember what it was anymore.
[4879.00 --> 4881.00]  There's actually a couple of different places.
[4881.00 --> 4882.00]  Yeah.
[4882.00 --> 4883.00]  There's a couple of different places it does it.
[4883.00 --> 4887.00]  I couldn't remember if resolution was one of them, but the point is that I think when
[4887.00 --> 4893.00]  you give people this, you know, oh, well this one's optimal for tablets or this one's
[4893.00 --> 4900.00]  optimal for desktop or for 10 foot or whatever else, I think you leave a lot of room for corners to get cut.
[4900.00 --> 4901.00]  Yeah.
[4901.00 --> 4904.00]  Well, we don't want to redo the UI for changing your user password.
[4904.00 --> 4909.00]  So we're just going to dump you in this other interface that you obviously, if you wanted
[4909.00 --> 4911.00]  to use it, you would have been using it already.
[4911.00 --> 4912.00]  Yeah.
[4912.00 --> 4913.00]  And then there's places where there's duplication, right?
[4913.00 --> 4916.00]  I mean, there's a lot of places where the same exact features are exposed through the
[4916.00 --> 4917.00]  desktop or through the modern shell.
[4917.00 --> 4919.00]  And that gets a little confusing too.
[4919.00 --> 4920.00]  I'm okay with that personally.
[4920.00 --> 4921.00]  Yeah.
[4921.00 --> 4925.00]  I'd rather have a duplicated feature than missing functionality in one.
[4925.00 --> 4926.00]  Yeah.
[4926.00 --> 4928.00]  Because that infuriates me when I'm looking for something.
[4928.00 --> 4931.00]  Because going to user accounts in the desktop version and being able to change your password
[4931.00 --> 4935.00]  and then going to user accounts in Metro, whatever the heck, and being able to change your password,
[4935.00 --> 4936.00]  I think that's fine.
[4936.00 --> 4937.00]  No, no.
[4937.00 --> 4938.00]  I agree.
[4938.00 --> 4941.00]  And what I do when I install Windows 8, the very first thing I do is I go change all the
[4941.00 --> 4944.00]  file associations so they all go to desktop applications.
[4944.00 --> 4945.00]  Oh my goodness.
[4945.00 --> 4946.00]  That is so annoying.
[4946.00 --> 4947.00]  That is the worst.
[4947.00 --> 4948.00]  Whenever I fire up a new...
[4948.00 --> 4953.00]  I don't know what it is, but whenever I fire up a new Windows 8 machine, I'm always in a hurry.
[4953.00 --> 4955.00]  So in the case of this...
[4955.00 --> 4958.00]  Because if I wasn't in a hurry, I'd install Windows 7 on it.
[4958.00 --> 4959.00]  Shut up, dude.
[4959.00 --> 4960.00]  Come on.
[4960.00 --> 4968.00]  So in the case of this machine, I was in a hurry because we were supposed to do our first sponsorship spot
[4968.00 --> 4973.00]  where we were using these computers on the WAN show and I needed to get my machine set up.
[4973.00 --> 4980.00]  I needed to get all my logins done so I could screen share and my Twitter and my blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.
[4980.00 --> 4988.00]  And what happened was I was hurrying through it and I went and I opened some photo.
[4988.00 --> 4991.00]  I think it was like the lower third for the show.
[4991.00 --> 4993.00]  And I spazzed.
[4993.00 --> 4995.00]  Like, lost it.
[4995.00 --> 5005.00]  Because it opens in this stupid application that has no functionality, takes forever to launch in spite of the fact that I'm running on an SSD.
[5005.00 --> 5009.00]  Maybe... you're a smart guy. You're a programmer. Maybe you can explain this to me.
[5009.00 --> 5014.00]  Why the hell could any application that's... let's say the photo viewer.
[5014.00 --> 5018.00]  Let's say it's super bloated because it doesn't do anything.
[5018.00 --> 5022.00]  So let's say it's super bloated and it's like a, you know, 30 meg program, okay?
[5022.00 --> 5023.00]  Sure.
[5023.00 --> 5035.00]  Why could a 30 meg program ever take multiple seconds to open on something that can read at 550 megabytes per second with a processor that's not even being taxed?
[5035.00 --> 5040.00]  The short answer to that is dependencies on other services.
[5040.00 --> 5045.00]  Why? What is it even doing with the other services? It doesn't do anything.
[5045.00 --> 5057.00]  No, no, it does. It does. This is the thing people don't realize is that most of the modern applications that you're using are based on HTML5 that's rendered through MSHTML, which is the IE's rendering engine, which also has dependencies from the rest of the system.
[5057.00 --> 5064.00]  So a lot of that slowness that you're experiencing everything is all those subsystems coming online and into alignment so that it can render your experience.
[5064.00 --> 5067.00]  That's stupid. That's terrible.
[5067.00 --> 5076.00]  But the whole point is, is it makes it easier for developers to make an app because they literally can make an app that compiles at runtime rather than having to actually like know how to code.
[5076.00 --> 5077.00]  Really dumb.
[5077.00 --> 5083.00]  I should probably rephrase that because that is a form of coding. I don't want, I don't want all the HTML5 jocks to come after me.
[5083.00 --> 5091.00]  But, but that's the, that's the simple answer is whenever you have something that sits on top of a bunch of subsystems, all those subsystems take a memory. Like people used to laugh.
[5091.00 --> 5098.00]  Like people used to laugh. Do you guys remember, like this goes way back, but you remember that competition that was held in, actually I think it was held in Canada, assembly.
[5098.00 --> 5103.00]  Do you remember that when they used to have the competition where who could make the coolest program in five kilobytes?
[5103.00 --> 5104.00]  Yeah.
[5104.00 --> 5108.00]  And so back then they did everything in assembly. Every single instruction to the processor was raw.
[5108.00 --> 5110.00]  They would try to make these things insanely small.
[5110.00 --> 5111.00]  Well, now we do the opposite of that.
[5111.00 --> 5115.00]  Now we do is we build a layer on top of a layer on top of a layer on top of another layer.
[5115.00 --> 5117.00]  That's like a cousin of another layer.
[5117.00 --> 5119.00]  And then another layer on top of that.
[5119.00 --> 5125.00]  You only have to write five lines of code, but at the end of the day, you're running 200 million lines of code, half of which you don't need.
[5125.00 --> 5128.00]  And that's the unfortunate part with higher level languages.
[5128.00 --> 5144.00]  The thing I wish had happened then, and this is going to seem like an odd thing to wish for is if we're going to do that anyway, then I wish Microsoft had had the stones to just stick with what they did with Vista and say, look, you want to have a great experience with this operating system?
[5144.00 --> 5145.00]  Get more RAM.
[5145.00 --> 5146.00]  Get a better CPU.
[5146.00 --> 5147.00]  They couldn't though.
[5147.00 --> 5148.00]  They couldn't.
[5148.00 --> 5149.00]  They couldn't.
[5149.00 --> 5150.00]  Because-
[5150.00 --> 5151.00]  I wish they had.
[5151.00 --> 5152.00]  I wish they had.
[5152.00 --> 5153.00]  Oh, you and me both.
[5153.00 --> 5154.00]  But they had to.
[5154.00 --> 5162.00]  That's the thing is whenever you create a product that's designed for a whole array of devices, you have to develop for the lowest common denominator, which unfortunately is like a Casio watch with Windows 8.
[5162.00 --> 5166.00]  I mean, it's kind of like it runs on this for crying out loud.
[5166.00 --> 5167.00]  What is this?
[5167.00 --> 5168.00]  This is a Surface RT.
[5168.00 --> 5172.00]  This thing's got like less RAM than like a flip phone and it runs on here.
[5172.00 --> 5174.00]  So that's the problem.
[5174.00 --> 5175.00]  They tried to make it super small.
[5175.00 --> 5184.00]  And that's the thing is, I mean, if Windows 8 was designed to just when it boots up, let's say I was willing to sacrifice a little bit of boot up time because frankly, who cares?
[5184.00 --> 5186.00]  Who shuts down their computer?
[5186.00 --> 5187.00]  Yep.
[5187.00 --> 5189.00]  Sleep, man.
[5189.00 --> 5190.00]  Sleep, man.
[5190.00 --> 5191.00]  So-
[5191.00 --> 5193.00]  No, and they do have, they have look ahead caching and stuff like that.
[5193.00 --> 5198.00]  Like the system is supposed to learn your, your tendencies, which apps you open and use most often.
[5198.00 --> 5200.00]  And then it's supposed to load those ahead of time.
[5200.00 --> 5201.00]  Like pre-cache them into memory.
[5201.00 --> 5207.00]  I think an operating system should probably assume that at some point the user is probably a consumer grade operating system.
[5207.00 --> 5210.00]  That user is probably going to open a photo.
[5210.00 --> 5211.00]  Yes.
[5211.00 --> 5212.00]  I agree.
[5212.00 --> 5213.00]  So why not just have it ready for me?
[5213.00 --> 5215.00]  I guess that's the question.
[5215.00 --> 5217.00]  And obviously it's not your problem anymore, but-
[5217.00 --> 5218.00]  Nope.
[5218.00 --> 5225.00]  That's, that's my frustration as the end user who kind of looks at this thing and goes, this is an app that has no functionality.
[5225.00 --> 5227.00]  It's bloated beyond all reason.
[5227.00 --> 5228.00]  Yeah.
[5228.00 --> 5229.00]  And it just makes my life worse.
[5229.00 --> 5231.00]  It does nothing to make my life better.
[5231.00 --> 5240.00]  The thing that makes me really upset is a lot of people like, like you're telling me about your bad Windows 8 experience and your, your bad Windows 8 experience so far has involved the modern UI, right?
[5240.00 --> 5241.00]  Yeah.
[5241.00 --> 5246.00]  And everybody talks about the, the, the modern shell, the modern experience and the start screen, if you will.
[5246.00 --> 5251.00]  And it's like, those two things define the operating system from the customer's perspective.
[5251.00 --> 5260.00]  But it's like, if you look at everything else, if you look at the memory manager, the kernel, the how all the stuff that was redesigned for Windows 8, it is so much faster and so much more streamlined than Windows 7 ever was.
[5260.00 --> 5263.00]  But like, which is why Windows 9 will be good.
[5263.00 --> 5265.00]  It happens every time.
[5265.00 --> 5266.00]  Yeah.
[5266.00 --> 5273.00]  But that's the, that's the thing that really sucks is it's like, all you do is you install Windows 8, change your file type associations, throw a classic start menu on it.
[5273.00 --> 5275.00]  And the thing will run circles around Windows 7.
[5275.00 --> 5276.00]  It just does.
[5276.00 --> 5277.00]  I guess.
[5277.00 --> 5278.00]  You might have some driver issues.
[5278.00 --> 5280.00]  But every once in a while, you'll run into something and it's incredibly frustrating.
[5280.00 --> 5281.00]  Yeah.
[5281.00 --> 5287.00]  The problem is that it just doesn't matter to me because I've, I've always been one of those guys who like, I loved Windows Vista.
[5287.00 --> 5289.00]  I thought Windows Vista was such a huge improvement.
[5289.00 --> 5292.00]  Going back to Windows XP felt like going back to the stone age.
[5292.00 --> 5297.00]  Once I'd been using Vista for six months, nine months when everyone else that was, was still shunning it.
[5297.00 --> 5304.00]  Because I was running, you know, four or eight gigs of memory at the time and I was running a very fast dual core.
[5304.00 --> 5311.00]  I think I either had an E6600 or a Q6600 or something like that, which was at the time, the Q66 was like a $700 processor.
[5311.00 --> 5312.00]  Oh yeah.
[5312.00 --> 5313.00]  Yeah.
[5313.00 --> 5314.00]  Obviously no one was running that stuff.
[5314.00 --> 5315.00]  But for me, I was like, yeah, this is great.
[5315.00 --> 5318.00]  So I've always been one of those people who's just thrown more hardware at the problem.
[5318.00 --> 5323.00]  So I mean, even with something like Windows 7, let's say you have some inefficiency or something.
[5323.00 --> 5325.00]  I mean, I've got an eight SSD RAID zero array.
[5325.00 --> 5326.00]  What do I care?
[5326.00 --> 5329.00]  Something's like 20% slower.
[5329.00 --> 5331.00]  I'll never see it.
[5331.00 --> 5332.00]  Yeah.
[5332.00 --> 5339.00]  So you go and put inconveniences in front of me, like not being able to alter a user account unless I go into the modern UI.
[5339.00 --> 5341.00]  Well, screw you then.
[5341.00 --> 5342.00]  I'm not going to use it.
[5342.00 --> 5343.00]  No, I agree.
[5343.00 --> 5345.00]  And I think that's where a lot of people get stuck.
[5345.00 --> 5348.00]  And are there great things about Windows 8?
[5348.00 --> 5349.00]  Yes.
[5349.00 --> 5350.00]  Absolutely.
[5350.00 --> 5355.00]  It's just, I'm not going to tear my hair out every time I need to do some basic thing and relearn it.
[5355.00 --> 5356.00]  I don't know.
[5356.00 --> 5357.00]  Yeah.
[5357.00 --> 5358.00]  I don't know.
[5358.00 --> 5359.00]  No, no.
[5359.00 --> 5360.00]  I completely understand.
[5360.00 --> 5363.00]  And there are situations where even I would run Windows 7 in place of Windows 8.
[5363.00 --> 5365.00]  I mean, they're pretty rare situations.
[5365.00 --> 5368.00]  But, you know, to each their own, I guess.
[5368.00 --> 5369.00]  Like you said with Vista, right?
[5369.00 --> 5372.00]  Vista was, if you only had a gigabyte of memory, you were screwed, right?
[5372.00 --> 5373.00]  Oh, it was terrible.
[5373.00 --> 5374.00]  You were absolutely screwed.
[5374.00 --> 5375.00]  You were absolutely screwed.
[5375.00 --> 5377.00]  Remember that horrendous ReadyBoost solution they came up with?
[5377.00 --> 5378.00]  Yep.
[5378.00 --> 5379.00]  Yep.
[5379.00 --> 5380.00]  No, I remember ReadyBoost.
[5380.00 --> 5381.00]  That was awful.
[5381.00 --> 5383.00]  Yeah, let's plug in a USB thumb drive and make it look ahead cash.
[5383.00 --> 5384.00]  It'll be awesome.
[5384.00 --> 5385.00]  That's stupid.
[5385.00 --> 5390.00]  But for the record, it actually did work decent as long as you spent a million, million dollars on your USB stick.
[5390.00 --> 5393.00]  I know it worked, but that's exactly it.
[5393.00 --> 5396.00]  The USB drives were more expensive than just buying RAM.
[5396.00 --> 5398.00]  And they had to be really fast ones, too.
[5398.00 --> 5403.00]  That was the thing, as I remember, if you plugged in one that wasn't certified and you're like, screw it, do it anyways, it would actually slow you down.
[5404.00 --> 5405.00]  Good times.
[5405.00 --> 5407.00]  I know people that did it for laptops, though.
[5407.00 --> 5408.00]  It was mostly for laptops.
[5408.00 --> 5409.00]  It really was.
[5409.00 --> 5412.00]  And honestly, a cool feature in Windows 8 is Windows To Go.
[5412.00 --> 5418.00]  You can actually install it to a USB 3 thumb drive and boot the entire operating system and run it right off the USB drive.
[5418.00 --> 5420.00]  And I think that's actually a cool feature to have.
[5420.00 --> 5421.00]  Yeah, it's a really cool feature.
[5421.00 --> 5427.00]  It's too bad that all of the instructions for how to do it are so obtuse as if they don't want anyone to do it that real people can't do it.
[5427.00 --> 5428.00]  Well, they don't.
[5428.00 --> 5429.00]  They don't want you to go into the library.
[5429.00 --> 5433.00]  They don't want you going into the library and booting their computer off your thumb drive and hacking the Pentagon.
[5433.00 --> 5438.00]  The kinds of people who are going to be hacking the Pentagon are going to be able to make their way through the instructions.
[5438.00 --> 5439.00]  You might as well just make it easier.
[5439.00 --> 5442.00]  We wanted to do a video on it.
[5442.00 --> 5443.00]  I know.
[5443.00 --> 5446.00]  But hey, it gives me something to make YouTube videos for the next year, apparently.
[5446.00 --> 5449.00]  Because I got all kinds of things that I can tell people about they don't know.
[5449.00 --> 5450.00]  So that'll be fun.
[5450.00 --> 5454.00]  Yeah, that was really infuriating because I found out about that feature.
[5454.00 --> 5455.00]  I thought it was amazing.
[5455.00 --> 5456.00]  And I was like, wow.
[5456.00 --> 5457.00]  We were going to do a video, 100%.
[5457.00 --> 5458.00]  Or booting VHDs.
[5458.00 --> 5460.00]  That's another thing they don't really advertise.
[5460.00 --> 5462.00]  But in Windows 8, you can actually boot a virtual.
[5462.00 --> 5464.00]  You can boot a VHD virtual disk.
[5464.00 --> 5468.00]  And the benefits of that is now you can put that virtual disk on anything, not even just a USB thumb drive.
[5468.00 --> 5471.00]  You can literally just transport it anywhere.
[5471.00 --> 5474.00]  Well, we'll see.
[5474.00 --> 5476.00]  We'll see how Microsoft does without me.
[5476.00 --> 5478.00]  Waiting for Windows 9.
[5480.00 --> 5483.00]  Don't you mean Windows Barnacles Edition with tears on the box?
[5483.00 --> 5484.00]  I would definitely get that.
[5484.00 --> 5485.00]  I would buy that.
[5485.00 --> 5487.00]  Somebody please Photoshop that.
[5487.00 --> 5490.00]  If you're watching this, I want to see a Windows Barnacles Edition box.
[5490.00 --> 5498.00]  If you ever did like a Patreon or like a Kickstarter to like Jay's Kickstarter to fund him to CES or whatever else.
[5499.00 --> 5503.00]  If you have a reward tier that is a copy of Windows.
[5503.00 --> 5504.00]  A reward tier.
[5504.00 --> 5505.00]  A reward tier.
[5505.00 --> 5506.00]  You get a tier.
[5506.00 --> 5507.00]  Yes.
[5507.00 --> 5508.00]  Ouch.
[5508.00 --> 5515.00]  If you have a reward tier that is a copy of Windows with a picture of you crying on the box, I'll buy it.
[5515.00 --> 5516.00]  I promise.
[5516.00 --> 5517.00]  Deal.
[5517.00 --> 5518.00]  It'll happen.
[5518.00 --> 5519.00]  If you don't do anything, there will be that level.
[5519.00 --> 5520.00]  Okay.
[5520.00 --> 5523.00]  It better not be so expensive that I can't afford it.
[5523.00 --> 5524.00]  No, no.
[5524.00 --> 5525.00]  I know you've only got Lambo money.
[5525.00 --> 5527.00]  You don't have that Bugatti money yet.
[5527.00 --> 5528.00]  Exactly.
[5528.00 --> 5529.00]  So I'll keep it down there.
[5529.00 --> 5530.00]  Alright.
[5530.00 --> 5534.00]  So speaking of employees and not performing very well.
[5534.00 --> 5535.00]  You're such a dick.
[5535.00 --> 5537.00]  These ones didn't get sacked.
[5537.00 --> 5538.00]  No, no, no.
[5538.00 --> 5540.00]  These are the ones not performing very well.
[5540.00 --> 5542.00]  These guys didn't get sacked.
[5542.00 --> 5548.00]  But what they did do was voluntarily give back a part of a bonus.
[5548.00 --> 5549.00]  What?
[5549.00 --> 5555.00]  So Samsung employees reported they gave back 2.9 million in bonuses to apologize for poor performance.
[5555.00 --> 5557.00]  This was posted by Dietrich W. on the forum.
[5557.00 --> 5568.00]  And this is apparently fairly common practice in South Korean companies, especially publicly traded ones.
[5568.00 --> 5569.00]  Wow.
[5569.00 --> 5574.00]  So to be clear, this was across a mere 200 managers in the mobile division.
[5574.00 --> 5575.00]  So I ran the numbers.
[5575.00 --> 5582.00]  I kind of went, okay, so they gave back about a quarter of the bonuses each, if we average out the whole thing.
[5582.00 --> 5585.00]  And there are fewer than 200 of them.
[5585.00 --> 5589.00]  So of their total $60,000 bonus, they gave back about $15,000.
[5589.00 --> 5593.00]  So they still took a $45,000 bonus on top of whatever salaries they're making.
[5593.00 --> 5594.00]  So they're still like super well.
[5594.00 --> 5596.00]  Still, that's pretty damn significant.
[5596.00 --> 5602.00]  To apologize for poor performance and a significant drop in market share that has resulted in...
[5602.00 --> 5605.00]  Only slightly billions of less money.
[5605.00 --> 5607.00]  I like how they still think they deserve the $45,000 though.
[5607.00 --> 5610.00]  They're like, oh, we sorry for our poor performance here.
[5610.00 --> 5613.00]  You can have $15,000 back. We still need the rest.
[5613.00 --> 5615.00]  Yeah.
[5615.00 --> 5617.00]  So that was a little bit confusing to me.
[5617.00 --> 5618.00]  It's like, it's...
[5618.00 --> 5619.00]  We're not talking...
[5619.00 --> 5620.00]  We're not talking Nintendo.
[5620.00 --> 5621.00]  Yeah.
[5621.00 --> 5627.00]  Where it's like, yeah, we are slashing all of the executives pay voluntarily because we need to do better.
[5627.00 --> 5628.00]  By massive amounts.
[5628.00 --> 5629.00]  By like massive amounts.
[5629.00 --> 5631.00]  We're talking a one-time bonus.
[5631.00 --> 5633.00]  We're not talking a decrease in salary.
[5633.00 --> 5634.00]  Yeah.
[5634.00 --> 5638.00]  And we're talking like a show of good will, good faith, like...
[5638.00 --> 5639.00]  I'm a super baller.
[5639.00 --> 5640.00]  Here's part of it back.
[5640.00 --> 5642.00]  Here's a few company meals.
[5642.00 --> 5646.00]  Well, I'm not going to Korea, guys, because I'm not giving back my bonuses.
[5646.00 --> 5647.00]  I'm sorry.
[5647.00 --> 5652.00]  If I performed poorly and you gave me a bonus, then you suck, company.
[5652.00 --> 5655.00]  You need to reevaluate what you're doing.
[5656.00 --> 5658.00]  Yeah, that's something I really don't get.
[5658.00 --> 5663.00]  Like, I don't get bonuses at all around here, apparently, because my boss is a jerk.
[5663.00 --> 5664.00]  But if I did get bonuses...
[5664.00 --> 5666.00]  He names his company all these stupid names.
[5666.00 --> 5667.00]  I know.
[5667.00 --> 5668.00]  He calls his company after himself.
[5668.00 --> 5670.00]  That's like, who does he think he is?
[5670.00 --> 5671.00]  Like, you know...
[5671.00 --> 5672.00]  What a megalom.
[5672.00 --> 5673.00]  Michael Dell.
[5673.00 --> 5674.00]  Just saying.
[5674.00 --> 5676.00]  Some other companies have done it.
[5676.00 --> 5677.00]  And it worked out okay for him.
[5677.00 --> 5678.00]  Yeah, Linus, if you ever get a bonus, give it back.
[5678.00 --> 5679.00]  Give it back.
[5679.00 --> 5681.00]  They used their last name for one.
[5681.00 --> 5682.00]  The Michael Dell guy.
[5682.00 --> 5683.00]  How about Michael's?
[5683.00 --> 5688.00]  A different Michael, but they sell arts and crafts.
[5688.00 --> 5689.00]  Do you like that company?
[5689.00 --> 5691.00]  Do I like that company?
[5691.00 --> 5696.00]  Linus, just for fun, you should actually go and talk to your whole media group team or whatever
[5696.00 --> 5702.00]  and be like, guys, I'm going to give you a $100 bonus, but I think you should give 50% of it back.
[5703.00 --> 5705.00]  Let's see if this is what happens.
[5705.00 --> 5710.00]  I want to see if the whole American or Canadian mentality is the same as the Korean mentality.
[5710.00 --> 5712.00]  I believe everybody just offers up that 50%.
[5712.00 --> 5714.00]  We should go spend all that 50% on like new company signings.
[5714.00 --> 5716.00]  We should do that as a channel super fun.
[5716.00 --> 5717.00]  That would be hilarious.
[5717.00 --> 5721.00]  Yeah, where I award each person a bonus and then tell them that I really...
[5721.00 --> 5722.00]  I'm not you.
[5722.00 --> 5723.00]  It's going to be like a percentage of the remaining gumball.
[5723.00 --> 5725.00]  Yeah, record it like vlog style.
[5725.00 --> 5728.00]  Just walk up and be like, I would like to record you with this $100.
[5728.00 --> 5732.00]  Give it to them in like 250s or something or a couple 20s and be like,
[5732.00 --> 5735.00]  now how much of that do you want to give back to the company for your poor performance?
[5735.00 --> 5739.00]  See my offense, that would be so funny.
[5739.00 --> 5740.00]  That's terrible.
[5740.00 --> 5742.00]  I just hope he doesn't get hurt.
[5742.00 --> 5754.00]  Speaking of terrible and getting hurt, Samsung is taking on Beats with their level headphones.
[5754.00 --> 5761.00]  I mean, it's a pretty blatant case of going straight after someone else's product because...
[5761.00 --> 5763.00]  Are they trying to level them?
[5763.00 --> 5770.00]  Well, no, it's because Beats is like a music term and level is like a music term and...
[5770.00 --> 5779.00]  Anyway, the point is now Samsung also has headphones that are expensive, fashionable, and according to The Verge...
[5779.00 --> 5781.00]  They didn't even put a name on this article.
[5781.00 --> 5784.00]  It just says By Verge Staff.
[5784.00 --> 5786.00]  So according to The Verge, for the most part...
[5786.00 --> 5788.00]  Well, because I think a whole bunch of different people try to do this stuff.
[5788.00 --> 5790.00]  For the most part, they sound alright.
[5790.00 --> 5793.00]  Except the in-ears, which are apparently just bad.
[5793.00 --> 5794.00]  Yeah.
[5794.00 --> 5797.00]  So let's take bets on which company is going to come out with volume.
[5797.00 --> 5798.00]  That'll be the next thing.
[5798.00 --> 5801.00]  You'll have the level, the beats, and then volume.
[5801.00 --> 5806.00]  I mean, if someone was honest about it, we'd get a bass line.
[5806.00 --> 5808.00]  The bass line of headphones!
[5808.00 --> 5812.00]  That's taking it to a whole new level.
[5812.00 --> 5814.00]  Wait, no, we already used that one.
[5814.00 --> 5815.00]  Damn it!
[5815.00 --> 5816.00]  In-bass, out-bass, on-bass.
[5816.00 --> 5818.00]  My wife has a pair of Beats headphones, and honestly...
[5818.00 --> 5819.00]  Why?
[5819.00 --> 5820.00]  Why?
[5820.00 --> 5821.00]  Why?
[5821.00 --> 5822.00]  Hold on, hold on.
[5822.00 --> 5823.00]  Because I got them...
[5823.00 --> 5824.00]  I literally, they were a $300 pair of headphones, and I bought them off my friend that was pissed
[5824.00 --> 5826.00]  off at them for like $20.
[5826.00 --> 5827.00]  Okay, you got $20.
[5827.00 --> 5830.00]  And they're active noise cancelling, and that's all I like them for.
[5830.00 --> 5832.00]  You put them on, you flip the little button, the entire world disappears.
[5832.00 --> 5834.00]  I don't even plug the jack into anything.
[5834.00 --> 5839.00]  Okay, well you're using them right, so I'll give you that.
[5839.00 --> 5841.00]  I use them for mowing the lawn.
[5841.00 --> 5845.00]  The best would be if he had like in-ears that he wore, and then he put those over top.
[5845.00 --> 5848.00]  Like you see gamers do every once in a while.
[5848.00 --> 5851.00]  So he's like, yeah, I listen to music on these, they're like nice IEA news or something,
[5851.00 --> 5854.00]  and then I use the Beats, which costs like Tony Vox for noise cancelling.
[5854.00 --> 5857.00]  That'd be funny, you put the in-ear monitors on, you just put the headphones over the top of them,
[5857.00 --> 5859.00]  everything, you're like, yeah, check out my Beats guys, and you're all listening to something way better.
[5859.00 --> 5861.00]  You're all listening to something way better underneath.
[5862.00 --> 5864.00]  That's doing it right.
[5864.00 --> 5866.00]  I don't know if that makes it better or worse.
[5866.00 --> 5868.00]  How'd it be cool in school, yet still popular with headphones?
[5868.00 --> 5869.00]  I'm sorry?
[5869.00 --> 5871.00]  How'd it be cool in school, but still use good headphones.
[5871.00 --> 5872.00]  Yeah, exactly.
[5872.00 --> 5875.00]  Do you guys remember the headphones that had the bass transducers in them,
[5875.00 --> 5878.00]  because they couldn't put good enough speakers in them to actually create bass,
[5878.00 --> 5879.00]  so they would just shake your head?
[5879.00 --> 5880.00]  No.
[5880.00 --> 5885.00]  Oh, I have used a gaming headset that has a similar thing where it's like a...
[5885.00 --> 5886.00]  The vibrating thing?
[5886.00 --> 5887.00]  Yeah, that vibrating...
[5887.00 --> 5888.00]  Did you ever try those?
[5888.00 --> 5889.00]  Yeah.
[5889.00 --> 5890.00]  They suck.
[5890.00 --> 5893.00]  I had one, I think it was like the Ben Heck 5.1s or something from some company,
[5893.00 --> 5897.00]  and I remember if you cranked them up all the way, it would blur your vision.
[5897.00 --> 5899.00]  Like, they shook so hard on your head.
[5899.00 --> 5902.00]  It would just seriously screw with your vision and make your jaw hurt.
[5902.00 --> 5904.00]  And I was like, why is this a good thing?
[5904.00 --> 5908.00]  You know that list that you've gotten me to get of all the different things that I want to try and get us to sample?
[5908.00 --> 5911.00]  One of the things is a bass enhancing vest.
[5911.00 --> 5912.00]  Oh, that's cool though.
[5912.00 --> 5914.00]  That actually sounds kind of cool.
[5914.00 --> 5915.00]  That's cool.
[5915.00 --> 5917.00]  It's like a chess piece thing that you wear.
[5917.00 --> 5918.00]  Yeah.
[5918.00 --> 5920.00]  And it like pulses whenever bass goes off.
[5920.00 --> 5921.00]  That sounds pretty badass actually.
[5921.00 --> 5922.00]  It's cool.
[5922.00 --> 5925.00]  There's one that electrocutes you and there's one that actually has the audio transducers that just shake.
[5925.00 --> 5927.00]  I want the one that electrocutes you.
[5927.00 --> 5928.00]  That would be cool.
[5928.00 --> 5929.00]  The little muscle contractors.
[5929.00 --> 5930.00]  That would be awesome.
[5930.00 --> 5932.00]  Like a seizure on the ground while you're trying to listen to music.
[5932.00 --> 5933.00]  This is awesome.
[5933.00 --> 5936.00]  Somebody shoots you in cotton, you go flipping off your desk and actually knock yourself out.
[5936.00 --> 5940.00]  No, it's not like a damage vest for games.
[5940.00 --> 5942.00]  It literally just goes along with the music.
[5942.00 --> 5944.00]  Now that'd be weird.
[5944.00 --> 5949.00]  It's like, it's supposed to try and simulate the feeling you get when you're in a concert hall.
[5949.00 --> 5950.00]  Yeah.
[5950.00 --> 5952.00]  Where like it actually shakes you.
[5952.00 --> 5953.00]  It's supposed to try and replicate that.
[5953.00 --> 5954.00]  I'm weird.
[5954.00 --> 5958.00]  I mean, I've got an audio transducer on my seat right now that that shakes.
[5958.00 --> 5961.00]  I don't have it turned on right now because I don't want Linus vibrating my ass.
[5961.00 --> 5962.00]  You guys understand.
[5962.00 --> 5966.00]  But I do have one and I do like the sensation of it.
[5966.00 --> 5967.00]  It makes your I don't know.
[5967.00 --> 5968.00]  It's weird.
[5968.00 --> 5969.00]  You can feel the bass.
[5969.00 --> 5973.00]  So it kind of tricks you and it feels like you're hearing a deeper bass.
[5973.00 --> 5974.00]  It does.
[5974.00 --> 5975.00]  The effect works.
[5975.00 --> 5976.00]  It's believable.
[5976.00 --> 5980.00]  If you put on a crappy pair of headphones, it feels like you can hear deeper bass, even though it's just the vibration.
[5980.00 --> 5981.00]  It's weird.
[5981.00 --> 5982.00]  It's hard to explain, but it's weird.
[5982.00 --> 5983.00]  It works.
[5983.00 --> 5984.00]  All right.
[5984.00 --> 5989.00]  Speaking of a crappy pair of headphones, Nvidia Shields tablet doesn't come with headphones at all.
[5989.00 --> 5990.00]  So the original.
[5990.00 --> 5991.00]  That's the worst.
[5991.00 --> 5992.00]  Yeah.
[5992.00 --> 5994.00]  The original poster on the forum was Sharif.
[5994.00 --> 6000.00]  And basically all I can say, aside from that I do have one, so I can't say anything about my experiences with it.
[6000.00 --> 6001.00]  This isn't a review.
[6001.00 --> 6003.00]  But all I can say is what Nvidia has said publicly.
[6003.00 --> 6006.00]  So it's going to have a Tegra K1 processor.
[6006.00 --> 6011.00]  That's two or that's rather four 2.2 gigahertz arm cortex a 15 cores.
[6011.00 --> 6012.00]  It's got two gigs of RAM.
[6012.00 --> 6014.00]  It's got a Tegra K.
[6014.00 --> 6016.00]  It's got a Kepler GPU with 192 cores.
[6016.00 --> 6025.00]  Remember guys, this is the same technology scaled down as what you'll find in a Titan, which Nvidia is very fond of telling people.
[6025.00 --> 6027.00]  Does that make it as powerful as a Titan?
[6027.00 --> 6028.00]  No.
[6028.00 --> 6031.00]  Does it burn your hands if you play any more than 15 minutes?
[6031.00 --> 6032.00]  No.
[6032.00 --> 6037.00]  The rocket kit that we have on the main floor has the same technology but scaled down as a spaceship.
[6037.00 --> 6038.00]  Yeah, that's true.
[6038.00 --> 6040.00]  So it's in much the same way as that.
[6040.00 --> 6048.00]  But what it does mean is in terms of API support, it is able to do a lot more than other mobile gaming chips.
[6048.00 --> 6055.00]  So in terms of effects and in terms of taking advantage of work that Nvidia is already doing on the desktop like GameWorks.
[6055.00 --> 6062.00]  This is stuff that might not be that significant today because the latest games, let's say Battlefield 4, you're not going to run that on this.
[6062.00 --> 6064.00]  That's not happening.
[6064.00 --> 6070.00]  But the fact that Nvidia is moving their desktop technology into this form factor means a generation or two down the road,
[6070.00 --> 6075.00]  you might be running Battlefield 4 on Nvidia Shield Tablet 3 or something like that.
[6075.00 --> 6080.00]  Because there's no reason that it's not capable of being ported to it.
[6080.00 --> 6081.00]  So that's really cool.
[6081.00 --> 6082.00]  That's what I like about that.
[6082.00 --> 6085.00]  It's got an 8-inch 1920x1200 display.
[6085.00 --> 6090.00]  It's got front-facing stereo speakers with dual base reflex ports.
[6090.00 --> 6091.00]  It's got a mic.
[6091.00 --> 6096.00]  It's got a 32 gig configuration that's available with LTE or a 16 gig Wi-Fi only.
[6096.00 --> 6099.00]  They sampled the 16 gig version so I won't be commenting on LTE performance.
[6099.00 --> 6101.00]  5 megapixel camera.
[6101.00 --> 6104.00]  It's got the new Direct Stylus 2 GPU accelerated stylus.
[6104.00 --> 6107.00]  It actually seems to work pretty well so far from just dinking around with it.
[6107.00 --> 6113.00]  And of course it supports GameStream, which is gaming on your PC but on your tablet.
[6113.00 --> 6118.00]  With now a bigger screen, you can stream to Twitch, which is pretty cool natively.
[6118.00 --> 6122.00]  So you can just stream playing Android games to Twitch on your tablet.
[6122.00 --> 6123.00]  Yeah.
[6123.00 --> 6127.00]  So you can just use the built-in camera right there and go ahead and stream that baby to Twitch.
[6127.00 --> 6131.00]  And then I think the big thing here for me is the Shield controller.
[6131.00 --> 6136.00]  So it binds using Wi-Fi Direct, which is, NVIDIA says, very, very low latency.
[6136.00 --> 6141.00]  And you play games by putting this on the stand and then playing the game on the controller.
[6141.00 --> 6143.00]  Now that's cool. I like that.
[6143.00 --> 6144.00]  I'd like to hear actually...
[6144.00 --> 6145.00]  Okay, good.
[6145.00 --> 6146.00]  Because I was about to ask you.
[6146.00 --> 6149.00]  Barnacles, do you have a Shield portable?
[6149.00 --> 6152.00]  I do have a Shield. I don't have that though.
[6152.00 --> 6154.00]  Oh wait, nevermind, right here.
[6154.00 --> 6156.00]  Oh wait, no, that's a Nexus 7. Nevermind.
[6156.00 --> 6158.00]  Wait, no, do you have the handheld?
[6158.00 --> 6161.00]  No, I don't. I didn't even know they had that.
[6161.00 --> 6162.00]  What?
[6162.00 --> 6165.00]  No, seriously, I didn't. I have a Shield. I don't have that.
[6165.00 --> 6166.00]  That's what he's talking about.
[6166.00 --> 6168.00]  Yeah, yeah, the original Shield.
[6168.00 --> 6169.00]  No, I have the original Shield.
[6169.00 --> 6171.00]  Yeah, good, okay. That's called Shield portable now.
[6171.00 --> 6173.00]  Oh, now they're going to call that Shield portable.
[6173.00 --> 6176.00]  Because tablets are not portable.
[6176.00 --> 6177.00]  Just calm yourself.
[6177.00 --> 6178.00]  Not.
[6178.00 --> 6181.00]  Okay, so you have a Shield portable.
[6181.00 --> 6184.00]  So give me your thoughts.
[6184.00 --> 6189.00]  Having the controller be a separate piece from the screen.
[6189.00 --> 6190.00]  Oh, 100%.
[6190.00 --> 6192.00]  Does this still make sense to you?
[6193.00 --> 6195.00]  No, I'd want it to be a separate part.
[6195.00 --> 6199.00]  Like if I had the option, I would absolutely want it to be a separate part.
[6200.00 --> 6201.00]  Why?
[6202.00 --> 6205.00]  Because I want to use the damn thing as a tablet when I want to use a tablet
[6205.00 --> 6207.00]  and I don't want a giant-ass controller in the way.
[6207.00 --> 6210.00]  Every time I try to use Twitter or Facebook with my old Nvidia Shield,
[6210.00 --> 6214.00]  it's like I'm holding an entire other object I'm not using.
[6214.00 --> 6216.00]  And it drives me nuts.
[6216.00 --> 6219.00]  It is weird if you try and use it for anything other than gaming at all.
[6219.00 --> 6220.00]  Exactly.
[6220.00 --> 6221.00]  Gaming and movie watching.
[6221.00 --> 6224.00]  But I think that they should be separate but have a way to be put together.
[6224.00 --> 6227.00]  I think that separate controllers should have like a dock on it.
[6227.00 --> 6228.00]  That would be cool.
[6228.00 --> 6230.00]  It would be a little bit heavy.
[6230.00 --> 6234.00]  Because that was one of the first things that I kind of thought about.
[6234.00 --> 6236.00]  And I was like, yeah, but would you...
[6236.00 --> 6237.00]  Okay, so you have an Nexus 7.
[6237.00 --> 6240.00]  Would you want an Nexus 7 mounted to an Xbox 360 controller?
[6240.00 --> 6241.00]  Really?
[6241.00 --> 6242.00]  Well, actually, yeah.
[6242.00 --> 6245.00]  Because I did at one point like 3D print a thing that held this on a 360 controller
[6245.00 --> 6247.00]  and I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
[6247.00 --> 6248.00]  Alright, fair enough.
[6248.00 --> 6252.00]  But then again, I'm not actually using it anymore, so maybe it wasn't the coolest thing ever.
[6252.00 --> 6256.00]  Well, we did up a Ghetto Shield as well and we thought it was the coolest thing ever,
[6256.00 --> 6259.00]  but then I don't think either of us ever ended up actually sitting and playing a game on it.
[6259.00 --> 6261.00]  So it's one of those things where it's like...
[6261.00 --> 6263.00]  Oh, you know what a shield is good for though?
[6263.00 --> 6265.00]  I found a really cool use for a shield.
[6265.00 --> 6267.00]  The Parrot AR drone, the little quadricopter thing.
[6267.00 --> 6268.00]  Yes.
[6268.00 --> 6272.00]  You can fly that with the shield and watch in real time while you're flying it.
[6272.00 --> 6273.00]  So you can like fly it around corners and stuff.
[6273.00 --> 6274.00]  It's actually really cool.
[6274.00 --> 6276.00]  Yeah, that's very cool.
[6276.00 --> 6280.00]  I think that's it.
[6280.00 --> 6282.00]  Do we have anything else for today?
[6282.00 --> 6283.00]  I think we've already run a little late.
[6283.00 --> 6286.00]  I had one other thing that was in the...
[6286.00 --> 6287.00]  Square Enix?
[6287.00 --> 6289.00]  Yeah, nah, not really.
[6289.00 --> 6291.00]  Dell now accepts Bitcoin.
[6291.00 --> 6296.00]  Square Enix is being buttholes, although they're perfectly within their rights legally.
[6296.00 --> 6300.00]  To take down a fan translation for Final Fantasy Type-0.
[6300.00 --> 6301.00]  They're just still buttholes.
[6301.00 --> 6303.00]  Yeah, it's just one of those things where it's like,
[6303.00 --> 6305.00]  yes, they're within their rights.
[6305.00 --> 6308.00]  Yes, I totally get it because they are localizing it for the HD remake.
[6308.00 --> 6310.00]  But it's one of those things where it's like,
[6310.00 --> 6314.00]  Square Enix, are you in a position where you need to be making yourself less popular with your fans?
[6314.00 --> 6319.00]  If you play Game Dev Tycoon, there's a point in the game where you get an option.
[6319.00 --> 6323.00]  And I don't remember exactly what it is, but it's like fans are trying to do something with your game or whatever.
[6323.00 --> 6327.00]  And do you throw lawyers at them or do you just let them do it?
[6327.00 --> 6331.00]  And I don't remember what the reward is, but if you just let them do it, you gain a whole bunch of fans.
[6331.00 --> 6334.00]  What is with companies alienating fans?
[6334.00 --> 6339.00]  Nintendo seems to be pretty hardcore about that now with the whole taking down videos on YouTube and stuff like that.
[6339.00 --> 6341.00]  Nintendo has... they're starting to work with people.
[6341.00 --> 6343.00]  They are actually starting to maybe solve their problem.
[6343.00 --> 6350.00]  But like in Square Enix's side, like if they just backed them, they wouldn't even have to do it that much.
[6350.00 --> 6354.00]  Imagine the amount of press that they would have got for supporting a fan remake.
[6354.00 --> 6358.00]  And imagine the amount of like fans and support they would have got for doing that.
[6358.00 --> 6360.00]  Compared to the other way around.
[6360.00 --> 6365.00]  Well I think they're just used to having so many fans that will blindly buy the next game that they don't even need it.
[6365.00 --> 6367.00]  But that seems to be going along.
[6367.00 --> 6368.00]  I know.
[6368.00 --> 6370.00]  I didn't say they were still in that position.
[6370.00 --> 6376.00]  If anything, I would say they are not any longer at this point in time in that position.
[6376.00 --> 6377.00]  Sentence.
[6377.00 --> 6380.00]  Yeah, well that was for emphasis.
[6380.00 --> 6383.00]  But I put it on the wrong syllable.
[6383.00 --> 6385.00]  Sorry about that.
[6385.00 --> 6390.00]  Yeah, no, there's nothing else I really think should be brought up.
[6390.00 --> 6393.00]  LG's doing good at selling phones and that sucks because they're evil.
[6394.00 --> 6396.00]  Really? Evil?
[6396.00 --> 6397.00]  LG's evil?
[6397.00 --> 6401.00]  Well, their privacy policy is like not very enlightened.
[6402.00 --> 6403.00]  Like have you ever had a look at...
[6403.00 --> 6404.00]  Privacy? What is this?
[6404.00 --> 6406.00]  I've never heard of this privacy thing.
[6406.00 --> 6407.00]  What?
[6407.00 --> 6408.00]  We live in America.
[6408.00 --> 6409.00]  We don't know what privacy is.
[6409.00 --> 6410.00]  America!
[6411.00 --> 6412.00]  America!
[6413.00 --> 6414.00]  Yeah, fair enough.
[6414.00 --> 6419.00]  I mean, the reality of it is, it's not like they're the only ones doing it with the TV thing.
[6419.00 --> 6421.00]  They're just the ones that made headlines.
[6421.00 --> 6423.00]  But they're doing it in a pretty brutal way.
[6423.00 --> 6426.00]  I know, I know, I know.
[6426.00 --> 6429.00]  That doesn't change the fact that you're probably going to get an LG phone.
[6429.00 --> 6431.00]  The reason why I haven't gotten it yet is because I'm still conflicted.
[6433.00 --> 6436.00]  Oh yeah, what phone should I get now, guys?
[6436.00 --> 6438.00]  I'm thinking about selling this one.
[6438.00 --> 6439.00]  Awkward.
[6439.00 --> 6440.00]  Awkward.
[6440.00 --> 6441.00]  Oh my gosh.
[6441.00 --> 6443.00]  All right.
[6443.00 --> 6454.00]  So, I think the last thing left then is Jerry, tell everyone where to find you so that they can go support you being on your own and being independent.
[6454.00 --> 6456.00]  Yeah, I'm a strong independent woman like me.
[6456.00 --> 6459.00]  I'm officially poor people now, guys, so I need your support.
[6459.00 --> 6463.00]  And I'm over at the www.barnnerd.com.
[6463.00 --> 6464.00]  Yeah, the barn, like where the cows are.
[6464.00 --> 6465.00]  Nerd.com.
[6465.00 --> 6469.00]  And that's where I'm going to be living the rest of my life probably.
[6469.00 --> 6472.00]  That's where he's going to make C and C++ videos.
[6472.00 --> 6476.00]  I'm going to make C sharp and maybe some C and C++ videos.
[6476.00 --> 6480.00]  And if I'm really going to be masochistic, I'll make some batch file tutorials.
[6480.00 --> 6482.00]  Oh, that would actually be really cool.
[6482.00 --> 6483.00]  I'd be down.
[6483.00 --> 6489.00]  Because I think you guys would love how to make like little destructive batch files that delete your Windows directory and piss you off really, really bad.
[6489.00 --> 6490.00]  I'm just kidding.
[6490.00 --> 6491.00]  I won't do that.
[6491.00 --> 6492.00]  I would never do that.
[6492.00 --> 6494.00]  All right.
[6494.00 --> 6496.00]  Thanks, guys, for tuning in to The Land Show.
[6496.00 --> 6500.00]  Thanks to our guest, Barnacles, for joining us and his little friend down there.
[6500.00 --> 6502.00]  And I think that pretty much does it.
[6502.00 --> 6503.00]  We'll see you again.
[6503.00 --> 6505.00]  Same bat time, same bat channel next week.
[6505.00 --> 6506.00]  Peace out.
[6506.00 --> 6507.00]  Bye, everyone.
[6507.00 --> 6508.00]  Peace.
[6515.00 --> 6516.00]  Dang it.
[6516.00 --> 6517.00]  There.
[6517.00 --> 6518.00]  Jesus.
[6518.00 --> 6519.00]  Oh, man.
[6519.00 --> 6521.00]  Oh, man.
[6521.00 --> 6522.00]  Oh, man.
[6522.00 --> 6523.00]  Oh, man.
[6523.00 --> 6524.00]  Oh, man.
[6524.00 --> 6537.00]  The Death Row will be here.
