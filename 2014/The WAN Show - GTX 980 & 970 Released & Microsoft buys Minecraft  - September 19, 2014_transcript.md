[0.00 --> 9.36]  and I think we're live so maybe possibly hopefully yeah maybe possibly hopefully
[9.36 --> 15.00]  we certainly we certainly think so I will jump into the twitch chat so I will let us know soon
[15.00 --> 21.66]  all right so welcome to the WAN show guys the weekly stream that happens every week come hell
[21.66 --> 28.74]  or high water no matter what even if we have already been streaming for almost a continuous
[28.74 --> 37.38]  24 hours prior to the show which is what's been going on so I think we best open with a brief
[37.38 --> 44.04]  introduction or a brief explanation of what the heck is going on and where we actually are for
[44.04 --> 54.48]  those of you who don't know we have been live streaming and videos mod 24 which was a 24-hour
[54.48 --> 63.12]  celebration of PC modding and PC gaming I know for a fact Nvidia invested a lot of money into oh
[63.12 --> 74.76]  oh you've got to be kidding me the dashboard should not have ads all right maybe Amazon will get that
[74.76 --> 82.74]  fixed all right so we've been down here for Nvidia's mod 24 a 24-hour celebration of PC gaming and PC
[82.74 --> 90.54]  modding they invested a lot of money into the event and they asked us to to come down and host the PC
[90.54 --> 97.74]  case modding competition there were a lot of really famous PC case modders including Darth Beavis is
[97.74 --> 103.44]  someone that I've known for like eight years talking to him on forums I think this is the first time we've
[103.44 --> 109.74]  ever actually met in person which is really cool funnily enough his rig isn't behind us but we do have
[109.74 --> 116.04]  the winning rig behind us which was I think the story that went along with it was really cool was
[116.04 --> 120.66]  really really special had to do with their their favorite land one of their favorite Nvidia employees
[120.66 --> 128.04]  who used to come down to that land and people are saying I look exhausted guys I wonder what I wonder
[128.04 --> 135.42]  why I have hardly slept in the last few days here but don't don't worry we are going to make it through
[135.42 --> 142.62]  this show in spite of the fact that neither Luke nor I has actually really looked at the the stream
[142.62 --> 147.26]  document no clue what's going on so we're gonna pick some highlighted topics for this week first up
[147.26 --> 156.10]  is of course the launch of the GTX 980 and GTX 970 that is one of the reasons that we are down here in
[156.10 --> 162.12]  California right now and we have a video up for the 980 and I think we're gonna be giving a video up
[162.12 --> 167.40]  hopefully next week yeah next we're gonna hit the 970 and I don't know if this is official or not but
[167.40 --> 171.66]  I kind of leaked it a little bit during the 24 stream that we might be doing some SLI testing oh we will
[171.66 --> 177.48]  definitely be doing some SLI testing so next big thing that happened this week Microsoft officially
[177.48 --> 186.78]  acquires Mojang so for those of you who don't know Mojang is the maker of the infamous Minecraft so what
[186.78 --> 192.06]  Microsoft plans to do with Minecraft I think people either don't know or don't want to know yeah or
[192.06 --> 200.94]  somewhere in between yep and then there is let's see there was something really interesting somewhere
[200.94 --> 211.14]  oh no right Apple has updated their security on the iPhone on iOS to so such that if your phone is
[211.14 --> 217.26]  locked even they cannot access your data which I guess is their way of absolving themselves of any
[217.26 --> 223.74]  responsibility to report any of their users data to the government in such a situation as that would
[223.74 --> 232.26]  be requested of them so I gotta give them massive massive kudos for that with that said the release
[232.26 --> 239.40]  of iOS 8 doesn't seem to have created a whole ton of fanfare amidst the community so it seems to be a
[239.40 --> 245.66]  lot of under the hood improvements without a ton of you know huge graphical changes like we saw in iOS 7
[245.66 --> 254.94]  so why don't we call that our main topics roll the intro and I finally found it that's cool and get this show on the road yeah
[269.40 --> 271.48]  for you
[299.40 --> 306.40]  you
[318.72 --> 323.28]  you can sign up as where space dot com slash line is these offer code line is
[323.28 --> 324.12]  to save
[324.12 --> 327.52]  10 percent on your own beautiful customizable
[327.52 --> 330.56]  website so we have only got
[330.56 --> 334.76]  see 75 minutes battery so we're gonna have to kinda fly through our topics
[334.76 --> 335.28]  today
[335.28 --> 339.64]  and and do our best to to cover them as well as we can especially given we have
[339.64 --> 343.34]  no idea we're talking about so for gtx 980 which is actually our first topic you
[343.34 --> 344.70]  can check out our YouTube video
[344.70 --> 349.02]  so we can fly past this one pretty quick and also the gtx 970 launch we having a
[349.02 --> 351.92]  video coming next week so I don't think we need to talk a ton about these
[351.92 --> 355.20]  individual well they are kind of important they are kind of important
[355.20 --> 358.56]  that is true should we talk about them yeah I think I think it might not be it
[358.56 --> 361.80]  might not be a terrible idea so in our performance testing in the YouTube video
[361.80 --> 366.66]  we found that 980 and 780 ti go pretty toe-to-toe in a lot of different
[366.66 --> 373.58]  situations but then 980 crushes 780 ti in power efficiency yeah so the to be clear
[373.58 --> 378.04]  guys when you look at any other review on the web you're gonna find you're gonna
[378.04 --> 382.26]  find 980 pretty much dominating everything else but the key difference is
[382.26 --> 387.22]  that we overclock all of our cards as far as we possibly can before running all of
[387.22 --> 391.16]  our benchmarks so what we found is that well 980 is a beast overclocker I think
[391.16 --> 395.20]  there was only one game that wasn't running over 1500 megahertz on the core
[395.20 --> 403.48]  just like really yeah you're impressive you serious bro our 780 ti is also a bit of a
[403.48 --> 409.58]  beast and runs well over 1200 megahertz too so given the number of CUDA core is given the
[409.58 --> 415.58]  384 bit memory bus that 780 ti has a lot of raw horsepower to throw at any kind
[415.58 --> 419.78]  of a any kind of a rendering problem so we ended up with them kind of trading
[419.78 --> 423.20]  blows the one that I'm actually really interested in and it's a kind of a
[423.20 --> 428.20]  funny story why we didn't end up with a GTX 970 in time for us to do a review
[428.20 --> 434.50]  for launch I was sitting in the briefing down in in California which is where I
[434.50 --> 439.36]  am now so here I was sitting I was sitting in the briefing very close to
[439.36 --> 445.58]  where I am right now and I got an email from gigabyte yo dog here's a graphics
[445.58 --> 449.14]  card code name something and I wasn't looking that closely at it because I was
[449.14 --> 452.62]  in the middle of a presentation I do you want us to send you a sample for a
[452.62 --> 457.14]  review and I kind of went yeah sure and I figured because Nvidia was only seating
[457.14 --> 462.86]  GTX 980s I figured that gigabyte was sending us a 970 turns out that the one
[462.86 --> 468.16]  that arrived from gigabyte is a 980 so we actually ended up with too many 980s and
[468.16 --> 474.38]  no 970s at all so I asked gigabyte about it I said hey um do you guys have a 970 that we can
[474.38 --> 478.00]  get our hands on we haven't we haven't been able to do a review yet and they said oh well
[478.00 --> 483.76]  we actually prioritized you to get a 980 because you're a key partner for us and I
[483.76 --> 488.38]  kind of went oh thank you that didn't work out very well for anyone but thank you
[488.38 --> 492.82]  appreciate it yeah I appreciate the thought you guys you guys are awesome we love working with
[492.82 --> 498.94]  you and all that stuff I just really wish we had a 970 so we can do our review of it so that's why
[498.94 --> 503.26]  that's not out this week but that'll be out next week yeah we'll get that up but I'm really interested
[503.26 --> 510.88]  in that one because the pricing is so aggressive as low as 330 bucks in the US for our car that is
[510.88 --> 516.70]  effectively around 20% slower than the GTX 980 because they cut down some of the functional units
[516.70 --> 521.12]  and I I don't actually know you're at the event but I'm assuming it also has auto balancing power
[521.12 --> 528.64]  rails no no no sorry that is still a top tier I know that's still a top tier only feature so 780 TI
[528.64 --> 534.88]  GTX 980 are the only ones that have that auto balancing power feature that makes overclocking on
[534.88 --> 541.18]  these cards pretty flexible yeah and pretty beastly yeah yeah yeah all right that'll be interesting
[541.18 --> 546.64]  because it'll be completely different overclocking experience of the new platform so the OP here is
[546.64 --> 551.80]  goodbytes what I'm gonna do this week is I'm just gonna kind of spam twitch chat because I didn't think
[551.80 --> 559.42]  to bring oh you have got to be kidding me I didn't think to bring to oh wait what oh here we go here we
[559.42 --> 564.46]  go I got this I got this I didn't think to bring to capture devices here so we've just got the one for
[564.46 --> 569.92]  our camera so I can't actually screen share with you guys but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna spam
[569.92 --> 575.20]  chat with the links to the articles that we're talking about so the original poster just let me
[575.20 --> 581.44]  manage the shirts there the original poster was goodbytes and basically Microsoft has revealed a
[581.44 --> 587.56]  fair number of details about DirectX 11.3 and DirectX 12 now we've got a lot of information in the
[587.56 --> 592.66]  doc that hopefully Luke is reading right now so he can talk about this a little bit but in a nutshell
[592.66 --> 601.24]  we actually had the DirectX project lead presenting at the Nvidia press event last week and in a nutshell
[601.24 --> 608.84]  he basically said okay well we'll look here here's what it is DirectX 11.3 is the features so it's got
[608.84 --> 615.10]  the new rendering features that are really exciting and are going to potentially free up overhead from
[615.10 --> 622.64]  the GPUs make it so that they can more efficiently render things like multiple transparent objects so they
[622.64 --> 627.88]  showed off rasterizer ordered views yeah rasterizer ordered views thank you so he showed off a few
[627.88 --> 634.10]  different things that DirectX 11.3 can do and then explain that DirectX 12 is basically going to have
[634.10 --> 641.06]  those features except with all that CPU performance optimization that we've been hearing about ever
[641.06 --> 648.44]  since AMD first started talking about mantle and how it was going to allow your CPU to your multi-core CPU to
[648.44 --> 656.54]  spread out workloads much more effectively now the funny thing about DirectX 12 is that not only have
[656.54 --> 661.40]  they made it so that they're going to be able to split the workload across CPUs but in the slides that
[661.40 --> 671.18]  he showed us something really interesting that we notice is CPU usage overall also plummets so while the theory
[671.18 --> 678.98]  that like the theory that I've had up until up until he gave us that presentation was that all of a sudden we're
[678.98 --> 686.30]  gonna have this yeah we're gonna have a justification for for you know GTX 5960 X just for straight gaming and
[686.30 --> 701.16]  games are gonna be able to leverage that I kind of went well hold on a second GTX 5960 did I say that core i7 5960 X thank you so I it's just running one game I was like okay yeah maybe we'll be able to use all eight of these cores and all 16 of these threads but then I
[701.18 --> 731.06]  kind of realized well hold on a second if CPU utilization is going down this much we might just not need the cores or the clock speed it'll be really interesting to see what happens to what we need in terms of CPU power for gaming I mean what I'd really like to see happen is I'd like to see game developers use the CPU horsepower that we have anyway AI destructible environments I don't know how CPU intensive it is but Nvidia's new global illumination
[731.06 --> 761.06]  feature yeah I would love to see some of that offloaded to the CPU so that we can get truly much more dynamic visually games in the next couple of years here it might take us a little bit to see some of these implementations because there's a few warnings it says it's very powerful but it's difficult to master and quote unquote dangerous and inexperienced in the hands of inexperienced programmers they're saying that the development model is that a few code gurus will make stuff like engines
[761.06 --> 768.06]  that they're going to build on top of it and outside of that they don't really expect too many people to touch it because it will be a very very complicated thing to work with
[768.06 --> 790.06]  alright so our next our next topic is engineers made a radio the size of an ant that doesn't require a battery this was originally posted by ETRJ on the Linus Tech Tips forum and the original article is from the verge.com so engineering professors from Stanford and the University of California Berkeley I don't know
[790.06 --> 820.04]  I don't know I don't know how that sentence was supposed to be structured so anyway created a radio the size of an ant no battery it's actually powered by harvesting radio signals and doesn't require any external power so the goal is to use these chips to facilitate the internet of things so for those of you who aren't familiar with the term internet of things it it refers to the concept that everything will be connected so not just your smart
[820.04 --> 850.02]  smartwatch not just your smartphone but even something as simple as your headphones and high quality headphones not headphones where having connectivity in them is this this janky kludgy gimmicky type of feature just everything will have connectivity because it will be so cheap to implement and so easy to implement that even good products will just will just have it so something as simple as you know your power adapter for your notebook
[850.02 --> 876.02]  could be connected there's no reason why couldn't be and that could feed into your house and tell your house how much power it's consuming and the house could you know automatically balance power who knows like the idea is just that once everything's connected we're gonna unlock a lot of possibilities that we didn't have before things like door knobs things like your car door so just being able to carry your smartphone in your pocket and have everything in your life be connected so
[876.02 --> 885.50]  um obviously we're not there yet no i mean you look you just you can look at something like the moto 360 as a great example of how
[885.50 --> 897.78]  yeah this type of technology is not cheap or power efficient enough yet for ubiquity mind you part of that problem is because they used like a i think it was a processor from 2010
[897.78 --> 910.62]  you have to assume that they did that for cost reasons there's there's a lot of um there's actually a lot of different reviews out there talking about how there doesn't really seem to be much of a sensible reason because there's actually cheaper chips that would have been better
[910.62 --> 920.76]  yeah i don't know maybe they got like a massive bulk order for of it for some like ridiculously cheap price or something i don't know even that doesn't really make any sense because i mean
[920.76 --> 937.58]  the the the release cadence for mobile products tends to be about a year and so i wouldn't expect motorola to be refreshing the moto 360 for probably about a year so it's not like you order a year's worth of cpus ever that doesn't make any sense
[937.58 --> 943.92]  it's just it's it seems so silly like i just i don't understand why they did that and i was so excited to get the moto 360
[943.92 --> 952.22]  and i'm so happy that i've taken to never pre-ordering things yeah yeah because holy crap don't want one anymore
[952.22 --> 960.84]  um so anyway these uh these new chips that are powered by by harvesting radio signals are only supposed to cost a few cents to produce
[960.84 --> 969.18]  so that could make it possible to integrate them in these types of commodity items things like things like light bulbs things that are just all over your house
[969.18 --> 973.96]  and uh and and then the kind of information they could provide could be pretty cool i mean
[973.96 --> 979.92]  not just being able to tell you okay how much power the light bulb is consuming but allow you to turn it on and turn it off
[979.92 --> 983.44]  yeah they can send and receive information yeah so you could be like kitchen light bulb on
[983.44 --> 989.54]  yeah i mean that kind of stuff exists right now but the problem is that it's really expensive the app
[989.54 --> 996.48]  ecosystems are not that consistent yeah and it's it's just not quite it's not quite there yet
[996.48 --> 1003.80]  moving on we have microsoft acquiring mojang so the guys that make minecraft for 2.5 billion dollars
[1003.80 --> 1008.70]  it was officially announced on september 15th i'm going to spam this in switch chat
[1008.70 --> 1018.70]  oh my goodness that is a lot of money so i mean and sorry this is again posted on the forum by the
[1018.70 --> 1024.42]  same guy that posted the last right if i could jump over there etrj there we go so a lot of the community
[1024.42 --> 1032.94]  is is pretty is pretty upset about you know feeling like they they got abandoned by notch
[1032.94 --> 1041.46]  um at the same time like but i get it yeah he has his reasons he said that uh he decided he doesn't
[1041.46 --> 1046.92]  want the responsibility of owning a company of such global significance and you know what he's kind of
[1046.92 --> 1054.02]  got a point because i think and it's not it's not a matter of selling out when you've already made the
[1054.02 --> 1060.28]  money notch doesn't have to work another day in his life but he will yeah because he's he's passionate
[1060.28 --> 1065.68]  he wants to do something else but when you're when you're when you're running something of such
[1065.68 --> 1072.98]  significance that's of importance to so many people you end up trapped he became minecraft yeah instead of
[1072.98 --> 1078.90]  being himself he was minecraft at this point in time and so you know yes he sold the money for
[1078.90 --> 1083.64]  what he could get i mean i don't think that that's an unfair thing to do and i don't i think it's
[1083.64 --> 1089.30]  unreasonable to expect someone to i don't know what give the company away like like how do you how do you
[1089.30 --> 1093.74]  get rid of the company without selling out it's not even you're going to run into a ton of legal
[1093.74 --> 1098.92]  difficulty trying to give away an asset that's worth billions of dollars like that that is not okay
[1098.92 --> 1105.32]  you legitimately can't do that so if he wants out if he doesn't want to do minecraft for the rest of
[1105.32 --> 1112.56]  his life then you know what i guess it's it might be better to do it now than to wait even longer and
[1112.56 --> 1118.44]  longer and longer and i think i think that it's uh i don't know i i'm excited to see what he's going to
[1118.44 --> 1124.32]  do next yeah yeah me too because uh other things that i heard like this isn't necessarily in the doc and
[1124.32 --> 1127.90]  i haven't done enough research on this at all but i've just kind of heard through the rumor mill
[1127.90 --> 1132.38]  that a lot of it was um being frustrated too because he wants to work on all these other
[1132.38 --> 1135.60]  different things but the second he does everyone's like why aren't you working on my crafts
[1135.60 --> 1140.48]  yeah look how much money it's making you why aren't you working on my craft yeah he's like i don't care
[1140.48 --> 1144.78]  i want to work on these things that are more entertaining when you when you have that many
[1144.78 --> 1150.78]  millions of dollars like i i think some people feel like they need more millions of dollars um
[1150.78 --> 1155.26]  not doesn't seem like one of those guys but when you have that much money a lot of people are just
[1155.26 --> 1160.20]  going to kind of go yeah you know what i'm set for life this is fine and and you know the funny
[1160.20 --> 1165.10]  thing the funny thing about it is even guys like i saw i saw an interesting um i saw an interesting
[1165.10 --> 1172.42]  quote from donald trump uh not that long ago where he was talking about why why he wheels and deals
[1172.42 --> 1179.58]  why he tries to make more money he's like yeah i don't need money basically i'm i'm driven and i and i i i
[1179.58 --> 1187.18]  i i you know i i i love to deal you know i love to i love to buy i love to sell i this is this is what
[1187.18 --> 1192.94]  i do this is what gets me up in the morning and i kind of went yeah you know i i i kind of i guess i
[1192.94 --> 1200.70]  kind of get that yeah and you know if notch's passion is making great games and ultimately it's not about
[1200.70 --> 1206.22]  the money then that doesn't mean he can't make a ton of money doing it it just means that he's going to be
[1206.22 --> 1211.82]  driven to do that thing and if we put him in this box where it's like you have to work on minecraft
[1211.82 --> 1217.98]  because money that's not going to make any sense no in his head no i don't know interesting situation
[1218.70 --> 1225.82]  i'm but i also i like i also get it because minecraft was is so community driven it's all about
[1225.82 --> 1231.34]  community and you know feeling like kind of fearless leader for a long time yeah i mean you've had this
[1231.34 --> 1237.18]  you've had this advocate you've had this face to put on minecraft where unfortunately you know
[1237.98 --> 1242.30]  one of his face on minecraft anymore the graphics ain't that good maybe he wants a better face
[1244.14 --> 1252.38]  it's so boxy i'm just kidding all right we've got some pretty good news here so op is qwerty warrior
[1252.38 --> 1263.34]  vesa released the displayport 1.3 standard so the maximum link bandwidth has been increased to 32.4
[1263.34 --> 1269.34]  gigabit per second so the reason we need higher link bandwidth you guys is not only higher resolution
[1269.34 --> 1277.90]  displays but higher refresh rate displays currently with displayport 1.2 4k is limited to 60 hertz but
[1277.90 --> 1284.94]  there's no real reason why particularly a tn panel couldn't run higher than 60 hertz why not
[1286.06 --> 1292.86]  why not why put why put everyone in a box no no no we want faster display links so that we can start
[1292.86 --> 1298.54]  getting faster and faster refresh rates on these higher resolution displays so extremely excited to
[1298.54 --> 1306.06]  see that it's about a 50 increase in maximum refresh rate or in maximum bandwidth versus displayport 1.2a
[1306.06 --> 1310.62]  it should be noted though that that's not going to translate directly into 50 percent higher
[1310.62 --> 1315.42]  resolution or 50 percent higher for frame rate because you're going to have more overhead built
[1315.42 --> 1320.78]  into that um so there we go actually that's the next point in the dock here so the combined link
[1320.78 --> 1328.70]  rate delivers 25.92 gigabit per second of uncompressed video data so that allows higher resolutions like the
[1328.70 --> 1337.42]  recently announced 5k 5120 by 2880 and that's through one cable without compression extremely exciting i
[1337.42 --> 1342.46]  mean you know what as as as much as it's great that we're getting interfaces that are going to be able
[1342.46 --> 1347.50]  to handle these resolutions without compression windows can't it is a matter yeah windows can't
[1347.50 --> 1353.18]  and guys compression is not necessarily the scariest thing in the world yeah a little bit of compression
[1353.18 --> 1358.46]  isn't going to kill us and we are reaching the limits of what copper based interfaces are going
[1358.46 --> 1367.02]  to be able to do i mean that's that's one of the reasons why hdmi and displayport have been so slow to
[1367.02 --> 1372.30]  continue increasing the bandwidth because we're getting pretty close to what we're going to be able to do
[1372.30 --> 1377.74]  without much more expensive uh without much more expensive transmitters and receivers on either end
[1377.74 --> 1382.46]  and or more expensive link materials so we're either going to get to the point where
[1382.46 --> 1394.46]  we're legitimately going to need fancy cables again remake that video yeah i know right damn it crap
[1395.18 --> 1401.42]  or we're just going to accept so so the processor is going to get more complex and less expensive and
[1401.42 --> 1404.86]  we're just going to accept that we're going to have to do some on-fly compression on the fly compression
[1404.86 --> 1412.14]  and decompression and hope that that doesn't add to the latency so this is cool you can drive two 4k
[1412.14 --> 1419.50]  ultra hd monitors when using vesa coordinated video timing uh continues to support vga dvi and hdmi
[1419.50 --> 1425.58]  via cheapo cheapo adapters that's one of the things that i really like about displayport is that compared
[1425.58 --> 1433.66]  to hdmi even hdmi 2.0 which the new gtx 980 supports and can handle 4k at 60 hertz displayport adapts
[1433.66 --> 1440.14]  to other standards much more easily which is huge huge thumbs up although i was pretty pleased to find
[1440.14 --> 1446.38]  out that hdmi 2.0 didn't end up requiring a connector change yeah yeah that was rumored for a long time
[1446.38 --> 1451.42]  and it ended up not becoming a thing extremely i think we had a rant about that on the wine show
[1451.42 --> 1457.10]  i think quite a while back but yeah i think we did i mean on the one hand okay but the flip side of that
[1457.10 --> 1464.22]  is i sure wish hdmi had a locking connector yes so i'm glad that we're retaining forwards and backwards
[1464.22 --> 1470.30]  compatibility for so long i mean that really is admirable but they could have even done like a
[1470.30 --> 1475.98]  side mounted screw mount thing though there is it could have been the same there is a company that does
[1475.98 --> 1482.22]  kind of this ghetto locking hdmi connector i think they patented it though okay and what it does is it is
[1482.22 --> 1488.06]  it clips into just part of the housing that's not meant to be a lot yeah but it kind of cheats and clips in
[1488.06 --> 1496.78]  there yeah so um so there you go visa releases displayport 1.3 awesome moving down we have comcast
[1496.78 --> 1502.70]  telling customers hold on hold on displayport 1.3 enables support for future 8k displays so that's
[1502.70 --> 1510.54]  something that we should probably mention and uh that's oh oh this is cool also supports a single 4k
[1510.54 --> 1516.70]  monitor 60 hertz 24-bit color over two lanes while offering another two lanes for alternative data
[1516.70 --> 1523.02]  types like super speed usb data oh so so that's pretty cool no displayport is really coming into
[1523.02 --> 1528.30]  its own and is going to i i think is just going to be the dominant display that's really interesting
[1528.30 --> 1535.34]  i mean look look at again back to gtx 980 how hard is nvidia banking on displayport three displayport
[1535.34 --> 1540.38]  connectors on the back of the card pretty heavy duty pretty heavy duty i mean g-sync only works over
[1540.38 --> 1544.22]  displayport this is an nvidia technology that they kind of went okay where's the industry heading
[1544.22 --> 1548.62]  we're going to bet on displayport and you know what for that matter amd has done the same thing yeah
[1548.62 --> 1554.78]  yeah uh earlier i think amd was shipping cards with two displayport connectors much earlier on the
[1554.78 --> 1561.82]  nvidia was so yeah yeah i mean when those two agree on something it's probably a good thing just putting
[1561.82 --> 1568.22]  that out there yeah so comcast has started telling customers to stop using uh tor and they denied this
[1568.22 --> 1572.70]  they've denied this to be clear yeah uh did you post the link in the chat i have not yet but i haven't
[1572.70 --> 1577.50]  copy pasted so i got it all right so this was posted in the forum by and then there was one and there
[1577.50 --> 1583.26]  are a couple of of articles that were used as references for this though so inquisitor.com and
[1583.26 --> 1591.98]  deep.web.com but there is there is a lot of information here and i'll let you run through it an agent named
[1592.62 --> 1597.74]  jeremy i almost said jenny because i'm pretty tired but an agent named jeremy has allegedly called tor an
[1597.74 --> 1603.90]  illegal service and said that uh tor is against their usage policies and apparently they've repeatedly
[1603.90 --> 1609.34]  asked customers to tell the agent what sites the users were accessing through the tor browser
[1609.34 --> 1614.30]  one customer spoke to jeremy then called back the next day and spoke with an agent named kelly
[1614.30 --> 1619.42]  she reiterated that comcast does not want its customers using tor and she allegedly said that
[1619.42 --> 1624.54]  users who try to use anonymity to cover themselves on the internet are usually doing things they aren't so
[1624.54 --> 1629.98]  to speak that that aren't so to speak legal we have the right to terminate fine and or suspend your
[1629.98 --> 1637.58]  account at any time due to violating the rules you know to me a fine should have to come from some kind
[1637.58 --> 1646.54]  of legal entity i mean if you what what what's next the grocery store is going to fine me like are you
[1646.54 --> 1652.30]  kidding like if they if if i uh actually i guess a grocery store is a bad example because if i was walking
[1652.30 --> 1656.06]  around the grocery store putting things into my coat so that people wouldn't know what i was buying
[1656.06 --> 1662.46]  i probably would get i probably would not get fined you wouldn't get fined but you could get prosecuted
[1662.46 --> 1666.46]  i think they'd have to wait for you to leave the store with it but they yeah they could have a plain
[1666.46 --> 1670.78]  clothes following you around totally different that's legitimately stealing hold on no because
[1670.78 --> 1674.38]  what if i intended to pay for it i just didn't want people knowing what i was buying but you left the
[1674.38 --> 1680.86]  store with it no no let's say i didn't leave the store okay okay so let's say i okay so hold on a
[1680.86 --> 1684.78]  second okay so okay maybe i wouldn't okay so i wouldn't get fined but let's let's talk ask you
[1684.78 --> 1689.02]  about it they could request you to leave the store okay because that's a physical premises but they can't
[1689.02 --> 1693.74]  arrest you you haven't left the store yet what can they do they can follow you around but then that's
[1693.74 --> 1699.74]  their private property so that's allowed yeah i don't think there's an equivalent to this no i love to
[1699.74 --> 1703.82]  hear from the twitch chat guys let us know especially if there's like a loss prevention agent
[1704.46 --> 1710.62]  dion7dusk lol grocery police lol if there's a loss prevention agent out there that actually knows
[1710.62 --> 1716.78]  the like shoving stuff yeah we'd love to hear about that because i don't what's up like okay
[1716.78 --> 1720.70]  so what's the equivalent like my mom does this i know a lot of people that do this kind of stuff
[1720.70 --> 1725.66]  where they're like go grab a drink from the fridge in a store and just drink the whole thing before
[1725.66 --> 1730.78]  they're done leaving the store and then just buy it yeah i you know the funny thing about that is it's
[1730.78 --> 1737.98]  always made me really uncomfortable even when i was a kid i hate it i might know my aunt my aunt would
[1737.98 --> 1743.98]  often say you know hey are you thirsty you know here here get this and start drinking it and i'd be
[1743.98 --> 1748.06]  like no i don't want to drink it till we leave and she'd be like well we're shopping like what if my
[1748.06 --> 1753.50]  card doesn't work we're shopping we're not leaving so awkward i'm not even worried about that although
[1753.50 --> 1759.74]  i did have a really awkward situation at uh tim hortons where i i forgot my wallet and my wife forgot her
[1759.74 --> 1767.82]  wallet and we were in vancouver and i had already placed my order and i was like oh crap i forgot my wallet can
[1767.82 --> 1772.38]  i run out to the car and grab my wife's so when i come back she's got my order ready for me and i'm
[1772.38 --> 1779.42]  like yo dog i'm sorry my wife doesn't have her wallet either i have to go i think i made it up to them
[1779.42 --> 1784.38]  i went and i borrowed some money from a relative who lives in vancouver and then i went all the way back
[1784.38 --> 1789.42]  to that tim hortons even though it was out of my way i was like i have cash now you know but i still
[1789.42 --> 1795.34]  they probably had to throw at least some of it away like i feel terrible um anyway sorry what were we
[1795.34 --> 1800.38]  talking about uh stealing stuff from stores uh drinking things before you leave right i just
[1800.38 --> 1806.62]  feel weird about it i remember that i just yeah yeah i i i don't do it i know my i i think my mom
[1806.62 --> 1810.38]  does a little bit i know other people that i go shopping with have done it and even with that when
[1810.38 --> 1815.98]  i'm with someone who's doing it i feel super uncomfortable i don't know why it's just i'm not
[1815.98 --> 1822.62]  really into that at all they have to have you on video someone has to watch you put it in your pocket
[1822.62 --> 1826.54]  they can follow you and watch you but you have not broken the law until you attempt to leave the
[1826.54 --> 1831.42]  store without paying okay so there you go perfectly reasonable because you should be able to go around
[1831.42 --> 1837.90]  a shopping center without a basket or shopping cart right i mean they can ask you to leave your bag at
[1837.90 --> 1843.42]  the front yeah so i usually and they can ask you to leave the store yep yeah it is there it is their
[1843.42 --> 1851.98]  right to do that yeah we have 5 000 live viewers right now who are tuned into our stream which is
[1851.98 --> 1859.50]  like super late like two and a half hours two hours late like janky janky quality don't know anything
[1859.50 --> 1864.62]  about the topics in the middle we have no we have no lighting other than like the terrible fluorescent
[1864.62 --> 1870.62]  lighting in this board room yeah and uh and you know what guys thanks for showing up we love your
[1870.62 --> 1875.42]  support that's really cool we appreciate you guys you guys are cool speaking of things that aren't
[1875.42 --> 1883.74]  cool is comcast has um has a past of being against tor and is listed on tor's bad isp project list thing
[1883.74 --> 1891.10]  all right so well as if uh as if comcast was not listed on a good one good isp list come on
[1891.98 --> 1897.74]  anyways i still have to point that out but all right um so this next topic is from and then there was
[1897.74 --> 1903.74]  one as well original article is from venture beat so the nsa is mapping the internet i'm not sure if
[1903.74 --> 1911.74]  this is news but uh nsa stuff just like assume anything you could ever dream of that's like bad
[1911.74 --> 1915.90]  and on the internet just be like yeah the nsa probably has something to do with that so the program is
[1915.90 --> 1921.26]  trying to create an interactive map of the global internet in close to real time that would try to
[1921.26 --> 1926.54]  identify the devices through which data flows such as routers the program is supposed to help in
[1926.54 --> 1932.46]  computer attack and exploit planning offering a battlefield map for cyber warfare targeted
[1932.46 --> 1939.74]  companies sounds good yeah yeah yeah so targeted companies include a deutsche telecom the owner of t-mobile
[1939.74 --> 1948.22]  and uh the german isp net cologne so pretty cool nsa you guys are just staying cool this is interesting
[1948.22 --> 1954.62]  because germany was already pissed off yeah i know right about tapping into uh what's her name's phone
[1955.74 --> 1962.78]  so it'd be pretty interesting this next one literally know nothing about it are we gonna do this one are
[1962.78 --> 1969.74]  we gonna jump over it yeah no uh yeah let's let's let's go ahead so uh apple's warrant canary disappears
[1970.30 --> 1977.02]  uh suggesting new patriot act demand so this was originally posted by lolz on the forum we don't have an actual
[1977.02 --> 1981.98]  link though yeah it's okay okay the original article is from gig ohm so if you want to just maybe post
[1981.98 --> 1987.50]  that link in the in the chat so apple's first transparency report on government activity in late
[1987.50 --> 1994.94]  2013 included a footnote that stated apple has never received an order under section 215 of the usa patriot act
[1994.94 --> 2001.74]  we would expect to challenge such an order if served on us um so writer and cyber activist corey doctorow
[2001.74 --> 2007.98]  uh recognized that language as a warrant canary or a way of thwarting the secrecy imposed by the
[2007.98 --> 2013.82]  patriot act companies and publishers have included these canaries to signal to their users that so far
[2013.82 --> 2019.58]  they have not been subjected to a given type of secret subpoena by law enforcement when this language
[2019.58 --> 2023.66]  is removed it is likely that the situation has changed and the company has been subject to such a
[2023.66 --> 2029.74]  request but of course is being told that they can't say anything about it so having that canary in
[2029.74 --> 2036.46]  place protects them and their users as long as people are paying attention so section 215 of the
[2036.46 --> 2041.34]  patriot act permits the nsa to demand companies to hand over their business records in secret
[2042.14 --> 2052.06]  it is believed that it is the legal foundation of the prism program so yeah not good not good
[2052.06 --> 2058.78]  mind you this uh this comes uh this comes out around the same time as apple's um recent change to the
[2058.78 --> 2064.78]  way they handle user data which is awesome which is pretty awesome that basically in a nutshell means
[2064.78 --> 2073.34]  that if your phone is locked even apple cannot get to it um so that is is pretty much their way of
[2073.34 --> 2079.34]  throwing up their hands and going well okay you served us a warrant for something we legitimately can
[2079.34 --> 2085.66]  access so peace bro i really like that that's really cool and i actually know a lot of people that are
[2085.66 --> 2091.98]  pretty heavy android users that might legitimately switch just because of that reason it's it's a
[2091.98 --> 2096.22]  reason to switch it's kind of a big deal i'd like to see how google responds to this yeah because i you
[2096.22 --> 2101.26]  know the way that the way that google is about data farming they want all your data they want all your
[2101.26 --> 2106.54]  data they want it all the time and they want it all the time i got to feel like if google were to
[2106.54 --> 2111.98]  decide that they were going to leave your data alone when your phone is locked would be that would be
[2111.98 --> 2118.22]  very out of character for them so i don't know they might put them in a bit of an awkward position
[2119.34 --> 2125.82]  all right so this was originally posted on the forum by ion bassa the world's first fully functional 3d
[2125.82 --> 2132.46]  printed car this was bound to happen yeah you gotta bet that there were any number of people working on
[2132.46 --> 2140.54]  making this happen oh my god you can download a car so it was designed printed and driven by arizona based
[2140.54 --> 2147.34]  local motors printing and assembly took just 44 hours hey local motors these are the guys that make
[2147.34 --> 2152.70]  that uh trike thing that i'm hoping to get all right uh for the for review don't worry about it
[2153.58 --> 2160.38]  probably won't even happen but yeah after 44 hours hours the car was drivable it's named the strati so
[2160.38 --> 2167.58]  italian for layers electric powered it's a two-seat compact roadster it has a battery a motor wiring and
[2167.58 --> 2174.94]  suspension these all came from a variety of sources including ronal's tweezy city car twizey yeah i don't
[2174.94 --> 2182.70]  know yeah i'm clearly tired and i apologize for any words that i'm slurring or or pronouncing incorrectly
[2182.70 --> 2190.62]  because i'm just not processors yeah gtx processors um chassis and body are printed from a carbon fiber
[2190.62 --> 2197.26]  reinforced plastic compound it has only 40 parts to it in comparison to a normal car with 20 000 or more
[2197.26 --> 2203.42]  parts this is actually this ties into a conversation we had earlier today where we were talking about
[2203.42 --> 2210.46]  how electric cars right now are very expensive but once they become more of a commodity item and and
[2210.46 --> 2217.02]  less of a less of a curiosity less high tech i expect them to actually be much cheaper not even necessarily
[2217.02 --> 2223.10]  that but once battery production goes up because that gigafactory that tell us uh tell us oh no right
[2223.10 --> 2229.50]  oh you have sullied the good name of tesla by calling them tell us i feel like a horrible person
[2230.22 --> 2236.38]  you are a horrible person the gigafactory that tesla is intending to uh build in nevada will actually
[2236.38 --> 2243.02]  produce more of that type of battery than all of the other factories in the entire world combined right now
[2243.02 --> 2249.58]  yeah yeah which is like ridiculous so with battery production going up to that extent i am expecting and
[2249.58 --> 2257.66]  and based just based on how simple yeah an electric car is compared to an internal combustion car i mean
[2257.66 --> 2264.14]  i i think i think gas powered vehicles are going to look stupid to my kids by the time they're old
[2264.14 --> 2270.86]  enough to be adults buying a car it's it's going to be this it's going to be this weird you know eccentric
[2270.86 --> 2276.54]  thing to do to own a fossil fuel powered vehicle i really do think so i think that we're still going to
[2276.54 --> 2283.82]  continue to see fossil fuels augment battery power so having a small you know lawn mower like rider mower
[2283.82 --> 2288.14]  class uh internal combustion engine in there to charge the battery in an emergency or whatever else
[2288.14 --> 2294.78]  i think we're going to continue to see that but expecting cars to just run on gas i i don't know
[2294.78 --> 2299.98]  industrial vehicles potentially especially being down here actually is pretty amazing while we were
[2299.98 --> 2309.10]  coming to nvidia headquarters i saw on the road at least uh 10 different electric cars and like not
[2309.10 --> 2313.82]  just teslas because this area is known for teslas a whole wide range of them so that was actually
[2313.82 --> 2321.58]  really interesting to see um the 3d printed car will cost anywhere between 18 and 30 000 though so
[2323.42 --> 2329.82]  right now the materials alone are probably what's driving up the cost i mean just plain plastic filament
[2330.14 --> 2335.18]  nothing special about it incredibly expensive you buy enough of that stuff to build a car
[2335.18 --> 2339.02]  you're gonna be spending a lot of money now you talk about carbon fiber reinforced filament
[2340.94 --> 2346.46]  yeah um and also it's it's going to be such low volume at the beginning that you're not going to
[2346.46 --> 2352.14]  be able to take advantage of local motors is kind of a specialty kind of shop so it's not surprising
[2352.14 --> 2357.26]  i mean if they were producing a thousand times as many of them i think we would see prices drop pretty
[2357.26 --> 2360.94]  considerable and i'm sure if you work with them it's going to be a very personalized experience as
[2360.94 --> 2365.98]  well this is kind of cool too uh the cost might seem high at first but many of the parts can be
[2365.98 --> 2372.14]  reused when you decide to trade change cars or upgrade so uh yeah i'm guessing things like the
[2372.14 --> 2378.62]  motor could potentially be reused if you decide to you know uh okay i want a single seater type vehicle
[2378.62 --> 2382.86]  i don't see any reason why you couldn't put it inside a different 3d printed vehicle yeah or a very
[2382.86 --> 2387.82]  different angle whereas like if your battery is running kind of crap you can swap the battery out
[2387.82 --> 2391.90]  keep using the chassis and the motor and all that goes up or if the motor dies for some reason you can
[2391.90 --> 2397.82]  keep using the battery in the chassis and that's another thing to that's that's really cool about
[2397.82 --> 2405.34]  the simplicity of an electric vehicle is i think the scariness of of car mechanic work is is going to
[2405.34 --> 2409.82]  go away to a great extent i mean tesla showed off what they swap a battery in 90 seconds 90 seconds
[2409.82 --> 2414.62]  like and that's that like huge battery on the bottom yeah so if they can do it in 90 seconds
[2414.62 --> 2419.74]  i'm sure i can do it in an hour yeah you know yeah yeah i think i can probably handle this i think
[2419.74 --> 2425.90]  you'd have to uh i think you could do it if you had a torque driver that's it i think that's the only
[2425.90 --> 2429.34]  thing you really need wow because you have to be able to torque in the screws to a very specific
[2429.34 --> 2435.10]  right and then i think yeah but you can you can you can buy one of those for what like 40 bucks at
[2435.10 --> 2438.94]  canadian tire maybe 50 bucks honestly it's not even that bad i think that's all you actually need you need to be a
[2438.94 --> 2443.26]  jack up the car okay and then a torque driver i think that's all you need wow that's outstanding
[2443.26 --> 2448.38]  obviously not entirely sure but as i don't think anyone has tried doing it themselves but
[2449.98 --> 2455.98]  anyways as far as i know that's all you'll need all right so this was originally posted by tech fanatic
[2455.98 --> 2461.90]  on the forum and uh this this this is this is actually pretty funny i haven't found out if this
[2461.90 --> 2466.94]  ever happened yeah because we weren't at a public event yeah we weren't at the public event down in
[2466.94 --> 2475.66]  uh down in la but uh there was an email sent out by amd to their team red members ready to infiltrate
[2475.66 --> 2482.62]  game 24 um mentions the warm reception from enthusiasts about their recent amd 30 live webcast
[2483.90 --> 2488.94]  mentioned that we're intrigued that another graphics products company uh jumped on the bandwagon by
[2488.94 --> 2494.06]  announcing a similar event they warmly encouraged their fans to attend the event proudly wearing their
[2494.06 --> 2500.30]  favorite red t-shirt and uh encourage their viewers to tweet pictures of themselves wearing their colors
[2500.30 --> 2509.26]  at the events and i promise to send some love the way of their users um i haven't i haven't actually been
[2509.26 --> 2514.62]  tuned into the internet enough to know if anything happened so honestly anytime i was i was dual streaming
[2514.62 --> 2521.02]  our own stream to talk to the chat so i haven't really seen the actual game 24 stream in its entirety i know
[2521.02 --> 2527.74]  i haven't even seen the intro videos for the modders whose builds we were covering the creation of for
[2527.74 --> 2533.42]  the last 24 hours so um you know what we've got to do uh before we end the show here guys we're going
[2533.42 --> 2538.06]  to do our sponsors next i think then we've got a few more topics but before we end the show we're
[2538.06 --> 2542.86]  gonna we're gonna pick up the camera off the tripod because uh i think we have the flexibility to do that
[2542.86 --> 2546.54]  here there should be no reason we can't move it and we're gonna we're gonna come and we're gonna take a
[2546.54 --> 2552.30]  close look at these rigs because they are absolutely beautiful you guys are gonna you guys are gonna
[2552.30 --> 2557.34]  love them i am amazed at what these teams did in 24 hours how much uh battery life we're running at
[2557.34 --> 2562.78]  right now uh we are sitting at around 45 minutes okay yeah we're we're we're cool we're we're running
[2562.78 --> 2566.94]  we're running good just want to make sure yeah i don't have uh i don't have another i don't have an ac
[2566.94 --> 2574.14]  adapter for the camera so we we can we're very limited by battery life right now yeah yeah so sponsor
[2574.14 --> 2578.94]  spots you said yeah yeah let's go ahead and uh do do you want to do you want to change over to our
[2578.94 --> 2584.38]  sponsor spots actually i've got a i've got a site for you to head to i want to do squarespace first so
[2584.38 --> 2595.50]  guys squarespace
[2604.14 --> 2621.98]  i hope we're back yeah all right woo we are back thankfully are we still streaming we're still
[2621.98 --> 2629.90]  streaming okay oh squarespace the fast easy way to create your own beautiful website that works where
[2629.90 --> 2636.14]  we go squarespace.com yeah yeah no no no i've got a i've got a url for you you're freaking stressing
[2636.14 --> 2646.22]  me out here man um it's uh foreverfresh.com f-r-a-i-c-h-e that's spelling of fresh
[2647.10 --> 2652.06]  so uh squarespace guys do we do i have the lower third up you do so squarespace.com
[2652.62 --> 2658.06]  linus is where to go if you want to give us credit for you know referring you to squarespace
[2658.06 --> 2663.10]  basically if you've ever wanted to make your own website squarespace is a fantastic way to do it
[2663.10 --> 2669.34]  they've got great tools including their logo creator their website creator they make it easy to use they
[2669.34 --> 2674.14]  also give you the ability to dig a little bit deeper if you are more experienced or if you want
[2674.14 --> 2679.66]  to get something off the ground now and then learn as you go and continue to develop your mobile site
[2679.66 --> 2687.74]  whether it's a blog or a store or just a portfolio or really anything just an informational website that
[2687.74 --> 2693.90]  you want to run and what's really cool about squarespace is uh what are we are we still are we
[2693.90 --> 2697.74]  still working that looks frozen yes it's frozen because i'm screen regioning whenever you're screen
[2697.74 --> 2704.06]  regioning oh cool okay that's good so uh one really cool thing about what squarespace does for the linus
[2704.06 --> 2711.58]  tech tips uh wanshow podcast is every single month they sponsor us without fail they sponsor two episodes
[2711.58 --> 2716.70]  a month they give us a lot of support so guys if you're if you know anyone who's looking for our website
[2716.70 --> 2721.02]  they want to make their own website refer them to squarespace you won't regret it they won't regret
[2721.02 --> 2726.06]  it so there's all that good stuff and what's even cooler than that is if you decide to give squarespace
[2726.06 --> 2731.82]  a try they have a two-week trial no commitment required two-week trial you create your own website
[2731.82 --> 2738.14]  if you decide to do that create your own website and tweet it to me with hashtag line of squarespace
[2738.14 --> 2747.58]  we give away an entire year of squarespace hosted website for uh once every single month so forever
[2747.58 --> 2755.34]  fresh fresh is our winner for this month so let's go ahead and get that up on the screen if luke could
[2755.34 --> 2759.74]  go ahead and uh i think we're having some trouble because the resolution of the desktop was so crazy
[2759.74 --> 2767.74]  high oh that makes sense freaked out we are streaming on a 3k notebook right now it's an aorus x3
[2768.70 --> 2774.94]  so um yeah we're not really sure how to handle the screen region capturing
[2775.66 --> 2780.54]  right now at this moment so can you just make the browser small and make a smaller screen
[2781.10 --> 2787.82]  i tried that region doesn't seem to want it this is what happens when we change all the streaming
[2787.82 --> 2795.26]  gears so the point is guys go squarespace thank you forever fresh for uh for tweeting that to me with
[2795.26 --> 2799.98]  hashtag line of squarespace you are the big winner for this month cool thing another cool thing about
[2799.98 --> 2804.78]  squarespace is they have highly dynamic hosting plans they take care of all the hosting for you and
[2804.78 --> 2809.74]  as your business or your blog continues to grow it can scale with you and grow with you you never have
[2809.74 --> 2814.78]  to worry about things not working and people having a bad experience when they come to your website
[2815.42 --> 2820.94]  so uh are you just doing a snipping tool of it all right well i'm going to move on to our next sponsor
[2820.94 --> 2825.98]  spot in the meantime unless you're unless you're ready to just kind of kind of go for gold here
[2827.02 --> 2833.34]  there we go fandom glass is another sponsor that we actually we love these guys oh yeah these guys are
[2833.34 --> 2837.98]  one of those companies where most of the time when someone reaches out to me out of the blue and they go
[2837.98 --> 2843.74]  hey we have this like mobile accessory it's like a screen protector and we want you to review it
[2843.74 --> 2850.86]  did the devices turn off oh do you want it's motion sensitive oh yeah awesome so we have this screen
[2850.86 --> 2854.94]  protector that we want you guys to review i kind of look at it and i go oh are you guys kidding we don't
[2854.94 --> 2861.26]  we're not gonna we're not gonna do an entire review video of a screen protector because one it's a screen
[2861.26 --> 2868.38]  protector and two they're mostly garbage but these guys reached out and i kind of went okay you're canadian so
[2868.38 --> 2875.66]  i'll give my canadian bros a chance here i'm gonna i'm gonna at least read the email and then i kind
[2875.66 --> 2881.74]  of made my way through the email i went that's actually smart because the whole idea behind phantom
[2881.74 --> 2889.66]  glass is that you're using the same gorilla glass 3 glass that's already on your phone as a protective
[2889.66 --> 2895.34]  layer over top of your phone and so i kind of went okay send it to me and i may or may not review it it's
[2895.34 --> 2902.54]  going to depend on how much i like it so they sent it to me and their claim was that their nano coding
[2902.54 --> 2909.42]  whatever nonsense that they call it would allow the screen to be applied bubble free every time
[2909.42 --> 2917.82]  and allow it to be taken off and reapplied should the need arise and i kind of went bs okay okay sure
[2917.82 --> 2922.78]  and so the first time i was applying it when i was doing my review video i was like super careful and
[2922.78 --> 2927.34]  like you know making my way down the screen pressing across it and i was like okay i got this on i got
[2927.34 --> 2931.58]  this on perfect cool and then for the second one they actually sent me two of them i just put it on
[2932.30 --> 2937.50]  all the bubbles made their way out it actually made for a pretty compelling video and phantom glass
[2937.50 --> 2943.74]  reached out to us because of our review and you know how how well we were able to we were able to
[2943.74 --> 2947.50]  capture on video how well the product worked and they were like hey we want to sponsor you guys we
[2947.50 --> 2953.82]  want to work with you guys so sometimes these these random things start up like that anyway the point
[2953.82 --> 2959.10]  is phantom glass is a great product and all of a sudden we've went from we've gone from they sent us
[2959.10 --> 2964.62]  a random email and i kind of turned my nose up at them to now we consider them a partner we think it's
[2964.62 --> 2971.50]  a great product absolutely great product and highly recommend it so visit store.phantom.glass to learn more
[2971.50 --> 2977.98]  we gotta we gotta jump back to the squarespace one all right i want to give forever phrase yeah we
[2977.98 --> 2981.82]  want to we want to give this website some props i mean the thing about squarespace is that it's pretty
[2981.82 --> 2986.86]  easy to make your site look great but it still is a matter of you know picking a good template and
[2987.42 --> 2991.66]  picking photos that look really nice you know i wish we could navigate on it because some of the
[2991.66 --> 2996.38]  people who submit these uh these these trial sites to us they don't really put much work into it and
[2996.38 --> 3001.34]  this one actually you can navigate it fair bit sorry man so guys on the stream you know please do please do
[3001.34 --> 3005.98]  check out the site and if you like it then then maybe give squarespace a try all i could really
[3005.98 --> 3015.50]  do is get that so yeah i know man there we go okay all right sandisk this is this is crazy sandisk
[3015.50 --> 3027.58]  announced the world's biggest sd card at 512 gigabytes literally half the size of the largest consumer grade
[3027.58 --> 3033.42]  full-size ssds and we're talking an sd card it can have right at speeds of up to 90 megabytes per
[3033.42 --> 3041.66]  second and should be able to hold about four hours of 4k footage or 24 hours of 1080p footage depending on
[3041.66 --> 3050.14]  settings this is according to geek.com has an msrp of 800 dollars actually not that unreasonable i know but
[3050.14 --> 3055.82]  it's for an sd card i know how many we have that die okay okay you know what though funny that you should
[3055.82 --> 3062.14]  mention that we've never had a sand disk die it's true we've never had a sand disk die uh we've never
[3062.14 --> 3068.78]  had an a data die so you know if i was and it's it's it's so funny because sd cards are one of those
[3068.78 --> 3074.70]  very simple devices where brand loyalty much like hard drives gets built just based on someone's
[3074.70 --> 3079.82]  personal experience and based on that extensive experience we we do have a fair bit of experience
[3079.82 --> 3085.66]  obviously the overall pool is still very very small and not statistically significant no but that
[3085.66 --> 3090.78]  doesn't change the fact that when you when you go through enough a data or sandisk sd cards and
[3090.78 --> 3097.02]  none of them die you kind of go okay well maybe we'll use some more then and it's working out yeah
[3097.26 --> 3105.02]  it's doing really well actually ah the logitech g910 i keep on getting messages about this and i have
[3105.02 --> 3112.62]  no idea what's going on this is posted by x tank slayer and basically logitech is working on our well it
[3112.62 --> 3122.14]  has announced um an rgp mechanical gaming keyboard based on romer g mechanical switches so it is it is
[3122.14 --> 3130.54]  funny to see the way the industry went from consolidating to everyone just shipping clones of cherry mx switch
[3130.54 --> 3136.78]  keyboards to everyone trying to differentiate again all of a sudden so razors going to their uh their
[3136.78 --> 3145.90]  razer branded switches that are being manufactured in china um corsair is still is still playing the uh
[3145.90 --> 3151.74]  the cherry mx trumpet pretty hardcore in fact they've started putting cherry branding right on their
[3151.74 --> 3158.62]  packaging that partnership is alive and well logitech who to my knowledge has only done one mechanical
[3158.62 --> 3165.90]  gaming keyboard g710 plus has gone and released what looks to be positioned as a higher-end product
[3166.54 --> 3173.26]  with romer g switches now so do you know where those are coming from no i know nothing i know
[3173.26 --> 3177.34]  absolutely nothing about romer g switches obviously i haven't been able to really spend a lot of time
[3177.34 --> 3182.22]  trying to figure it out uh because the most amount of information i've seen about this is in this dock
[3182.22 --> 3189.82]  right now yeah so i've uh i've been a little busy with my k70 rgb which has a 130 plus page user manual by the
[3189.82 --> 3196.22]  way this this is like the not for noobs keyboard as far as i can tell so far although i made my way
[3196.22 --> 3201.18]  through about the first 40 pages on the flight here and most of it is pretty self-explanatory well there's
[3201.18 --> 3206.22]  that once once you get to it there's that like full light control panel thing that's going to be
[3206.22 --> 3212.86]  complicated yeah and that'll probably be complicated so uh logitech's going to have their arcs control sdk
[3212.86 --> 3216.62]  that's going to allow you to control your peripherals from your phone screen dpi etc
[3220.22 --> 3225.02]  okay and show system information gonna have media controls for tablets or smartphones
[3225.02 --> 3229.98]  uh logitech is sending us a g910 okay so i've already been in touch and we are we are going to
[3229.98 --> 3236.06]  definitely try it out and uh really interested to learn more about the switches see i mean they're
[3236.06 --> 3242.54]  rating them for more clicks which for me you know going okay well ours is 70 million keystrokes versus
[3242.54 --> 3248.06]  your 50 million keystrokes it's all kind of especially when academic especially mechanical switches it's
[3248.06 --> 3256.46]  like yeah these don't really break yeah i mean i think cherry's braiding a 50 million is probably pretty
[3256.46 --> 3264.46]  conservative yeah yeah i don't know this sounds all right really cool i think you just skipped over it
[3264.46 --> 3269.74]  with your cursor but bleep bit torrent no i'm on that originally posted by ray fee on the forum
[3269.74 --> 3276.54]  original articles from the verge.com and bit torrent is determined to get rid of the stigma and that's
[3276.54 --> 3282.62]  good because they don't deserve it no so so tell us about tell us about bleep i honestly know nothing
[3282.62 --> 3288.14]  about it this is the first time i've seen anything about it but the second i read any information about
[3288.14 --> 3294.38]  it so it's it's it's it's basically a chat client where it's practically impossible quote unquote
[3294.38 --> 3299.98]  to gather metadata on who's talking and it will be available for windows 7 8 mac android ios clients
[3300.94 --> 3306.38]  basically everything the second i read that which is basically all i really needed to know it's also in
[3306.38 --> 3312.30]  public alpha by the way i i'm pretty stoked and i might move a lot of things to this platform if it
[3312.30 --> 3320.46]  actually works really well because not a fan of skype yeah hate it but it's the only thing that i could
[3320.46 --> 3327.02]  seem to be able to get everyone on at the same time and everyone has the same complaints about it
[3327.02 --> 3331.90]  which this might be able to solve right which would be great so i hope they have stuff like group chats
[3331.90 --> 3338.06]  which would be very important for stuff that i do um and i i don't know it would be really easy really
[3338.06 --> 3343.02]  interesting to see maybe if they have um voice chat as well i know pretty much an eye on it i mean
[3343.02 --> 3348.46]  we've seen how quickly bit torrent sync is moving oh my goodness yeah so bit torrent sync is changing
[3348.46 --> 3353.02]  really fast so that's their that's their kind of i don't want to call it a dropbox competitor
[3353.58 --> 3359.58]  because it's not but it has some similar functionality to cloud-based storage solutions like dropbox except
[3359.58 --> 3364.22]  you control your own cloud and that's what that's what bit torrent is all about maintaining your
[3364.22 --> 3370.06]  anonymity and your privacy and controlling your own data and you got to respect that as a company
[3370.06 --> 3374.62]  mission statement apparently from comcast you are illegal and should get off their service
[3374.62 --> 3381.98]  yeah speaking of illegal uh the pirate bay founder told he can expect to carry his father's coffin
[3381.98 --> 3388.30]  while wearing handcuffs this is this is pretty gross um there's only 50 days left on his sentence and
[3388.30 --> 3394.54]  his brother matt has spoken out for uh for apparently the first time the original articles from torrentfreak.com
[3394.54 --> 3399.26]  has spoken out for the first time in his brother's favor saying you know i've deliberately said very little
[3399.26 --> 3407.74]  partly because he can speak for himself um but i feel like the the justice system has forgotten about
[3407.74 --> 3414.70]  its job to support prisoners to ensure that they don't return to prison and even though uh their father
[3414.70 --> 3419.34]  has been seriously ill for some time and was admitted to the hospital in the summer peter has only been
[3419.34 --> 3424.06]  able to visit his father once and has been told he's allowed to attend his father's funeral but two guards
[3424.06 --> 3430.06]  will accompany him and he will have to wear handcuffs and um his his brother basically is speaking out
[3430.06 --> 3434.54]  against this sorry give us one moment is speaking out against this saying well the problem with this
[3434.54 --> 3440.22]  is that it punishes not only him but also me and my mother and my dead father and everyone that's going
[3440.22 --> 3444.94]  to be at the funeral and everyone who's going to be at the funeral doesn't feel fair the optics on that
[3444.94 --> 3451.18]  are going to be horrible yep google seizes nexus 5 production this was posted by top wargamer on the
[3451.18 --> 3455.98]  forum original article is from slash gear this came from canadian wireless carrier wind mobile's
[3455.98 --> 3461.02]  customer support via twitter a customer asked why they don't list the nexus 5 on their device page
[3461.02 --> 3464.22]  and win said well because it's no longer being made and we don't have any stock
[3465.90 --> 3472.94]  samsung to build its own mobile gpu uh this is posted on fudzilla.com i wonder if that'll be more
[3472.94 --> 3479.18]  more uh suing from nvidia interesting samsung has managed to hire x nvidia amd and intel employees nothing
[3479.18 --> 3483.10]  has been announced yet the development has apparently been going on for at least two years
[3485.66 --> 3490.14]  all right i think we're pretty much going to have to call that one quick thing before we go actually
[3490.14 --> 3493.74]  because i know quite a few of my friends are really excited about this is that twitch announces its
[3493.74 --> 3500.30]  google chromecast yes posted by raphi on the forum uh the original source is blog.twitch.tv this is
[3500.30 --> 3506.70]  exciting yeah so there's there's honestly not a ton else to say but it's sweet yeah so now you can you can
[3506.70 --> 3512.30]  you can watch the wan show on your tv with your chromecast yeah yeah next week because this one's
[3512.30 --> 3518.86]  basically over yeah um so i do want to i do want to pick up the camera there i think i think we're
[3518.86 --> 3522.94]  being kicked out because it's time for everyone to go to dinner and i'm sure everyone's just kind of
[3522.94 --> 3531.26]  somehow manipulate i'm tired in general uh yeah sure so um you know what oh i don't have i don't have my
[3531.26 --> 3537.74]  lav mic unfortunately so you know what here's what i'm gonna do i'm just gonna oh i don't know if i can
[3537.74 --> 3545.26]  pop you know what i'm just gonna carry this
[3550.14 --> 3552.06]  okay so
[3552.06 --> 3561.58]  this is the ghettoist ghettoist setup ever but i'm gonna i'm gonna hold this like this
[3562.30 --> 3567.18]  and uh we want to show you guys we want to show you guys these modded out rigs i think the most
[3567.18 --> 3571.74]  be careful not to press that middle button yeah all right i think i'm still wrapped up somewhere
[3572.86 --> 3576.06]  uh i got no idea man
[3576.06 --> 3583.58]  uh oh the xlr cable well you don't need to get that far right if you hear if you put the laptop
[3583.58 --> 3600.06]  on the table i think you should be you should be long enough to uh to reach the rigs here so uh
