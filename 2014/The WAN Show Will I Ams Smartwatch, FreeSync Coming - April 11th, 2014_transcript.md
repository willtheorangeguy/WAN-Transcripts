[0.00 --> 15.12]  Welcome to the WAN Show, guys! The show where I and my co-host, Luke Slick Lafreniere, talk to you about the latest in technology and gaming and all that good stuff.
[15.12 --> 30.38]  You know what's funny is I do most of the talking on this show, but it still feels really weird to have this thing next to me. I was actually really hoping that Luke would be able to join me on the show this week, but that is unfortunately not possible because I haven't heard from him.
[30.38 --> 43.20]  He landed in Boston yesterday early morning, I think, or the night before. I don't even know. He flew out Thursday very early morning, so must have landed in Boston Thursday night.
[44.02 --> 58.82]  Other than getting a call from him, hey, we landed safely. Did you ever arrange a shuttle? To which I said no. I haven't actually heard from either him or Brandon, so they're going to be there doing all of our PAX East coverage,
[58.82 --> 70.18]  which you guys can look forward to finding on the channel over the next few days here. They're going to have a lot of emphasis on the Indie Mega Booth because that's something that Luke is super passionate about,
[70.36 --> 81.30]  but they are going to make the rounds to some of your favorite hardware vendors like Cooler Master as well as, I think they're going to swing by Kingston, and there's at least a couple other ones.
[81.30 --> 93.24]  Oh yeah, Intel for sure. Intel is powering our trip to the show, which I've mentioned on the last few WAN shows, so between Intel and Corsair, that is the entire reason that Luke and Brandon were able to go.
[93.24 --> 104.10]  I'm going to try and do a little bit more audience interaction today just because I don't have... I mean, you know, this guy is like, you know, I like interacting with...
[104.10 --> 112.62]  No, no, not interacting like that. I love interacting with my dummy right here, but not having Luke here is just a little bit unfortunate.
[112.62 --> 126.62]  If people are asking me to go get Taryn, I would love to. Unfortunately, because my human physiology requires me to sleep once in a while, I wasn't able to get this Friday,
[126.88 --> 135.02]  so today's Fast As Possible scripted yet, to film it Thursday evening before I went home.
[135.02 --> 141.80]  So I had to film it when I got back from NCIX today, which means that Taryn is actually editing right now.
[142.16 --> 150.24]  So Luke and Brandon are in Boston, and Edsel is still at NCIX, and then Taryn is the only one who's here with me.
[151.22 --> 157.52]  All right, so let's go through some of the fantastic topics that we've got today before we do our intro here.
[157.52 --> 162.72]  So let me see. Will.i.am says he developed a smartwatch.
[162.72 --> 168.54]  I, personally, would absolutely love to check it out.
[169.38 --> 174.42]  It's going to be coming in a little while. He funded it, used his own money to develop it, so more on that a little bit later.
[174.84 --> 183.90]  The word on the street is also that VESA has accepted FreeSync as part of the upcoming extension to DisplayPort called 1.2a,
[184.10 --> 186.82]  which could be very, very good news for gamers.
[187.40 --> 192.10]  Google is taking another crack at the living room with Android TV. More on that later.
[192.10 --> 196.92]  And the Blackmagic Ursa. Okay, maybe you guys don't...
[197.56 --> 201.14]  Maybe you don't think you care about camera technology.
[201.98 --> 208.74]  But riddle me this. Have you noticed the dramatic change in the quality of our videos over the last year?
[209.06 --> 211.16]  That is thanks to camera technology.
[211.16 --> 219.40]  The reason WAN Show looks so crisp compared to a lot of other streams is the Blackmagic camera that we use to power it.
[219.46 --> 223.20]  That's their first camera, the Blackmagic Cinema Camera. It's a 2.5k camera.
[223.68 --> 226.04]  Now this one... Okay, I'll tell you more about it later.
[226.10 --> 228.56]  But anyway, trust me, it's like really freaking cool.
[228.66 --> 230.90]  It's like this upgradable camera.
[231.38 --> 233.64]  And then... Oh, this one's really cool as well.
[233.64 --> 236.74]  So there's a new battery technology potentially coming.
[237.10 --> 240.66]  Seems to... The researchers seem to be very confident about it.
[240.68 --> 245.20]  That could allow your phone to be recharged in under 25 seconds.
[245.74 --> 248.10]  And I don't know where I got the number 25 from. I'm sorry.
[248.18 --> 250.84]  Under 30 seconds. The demo was 26 seconds.
[251.26 --> 252.64]  So 25. I'm just...
[253.18 --> 258.98]  There's a new technology that could allow your car to go from 0 to 500 miles an hour in 3 seconds.
[258.98 --> 260.52]  I'm just making stuff up at this point.
[260.58 --> 264.56]  But I'll tell you guys more about that later on in the show as well.
[268.88 --> 270.38]  Why is there no sound?
[270.50 --> 271.32]  I'll just make the sound.
[282.64 --> 283.72]  I'm gonna kill Edsel.
[283.72 --> 287.36]  Because he forgot to put the music in.
[289.48 --> 296.36]  Ah, yes. Our sponsors of the show today are Asus, ROG Notebooks, and DollarShaveClub.com.
[296.44 --> 298.30]  Shave time, shave money.
[298.86 --> 302.86]  Big thanks to both of those sponsors, who we will tell you more about later,
[303.14 --> 306.32]  for making this week's episode of The WAN Show possible.
[306.64 --> 309.60]  Or at least helping us actually make a living while we do it.
[309.64 --> 311.84]  I mean, it would be possible to do anything.
[311.84 --> 316.22]  I mean, you could make a battery that recharges in 25 seconds,
[316.32 --> 317.68]  or a car that goes from 0 to 500.
[317.86 --> 319.30]  No, okay. I'm just gonna stop with that now.
[319.36 --> 321.14]  It's not actually funny for me to make up things.
[321.50 --> 323.54]  Make up things and present them as news.
[323.70 --> 325.46]  Linus Media Group. That should be our tagline.
[326.00 --> 327.84]  All right. So...
[327.84 --> 330.84]  Will.i.am claims to have developed a smartwatch.
[331.58 --> 333.84]  The article that we're gonna be checking out here is from Engadget,
[334.84 --> 337.28]  but this was posted on the forum by Kooza.
[337.54 --> 339.04]  Thank you very, very much.
[339.04 --> 343.60]  We really do appreciate when people take the time, make up things, and present them as news.
[343.72 --> 344.88]  Oh, for crying out loud.
[345.10 --> 345.60]  Stop that.
[346.38 --> 347.20]  Why you do that?
[347.26 --> 348.20]  Why you do that, Twitch?
[348.30 --> 351.64]  Why you make that the automatic default setting there?
[351.96 --> 352.34]  All right.
[352.42 --> 355.64]  So we appreciate when people post in the news section of linustechtips.com,
[355.70 --> 357.68]  because we love how active the forum is,
[357.72 --> 360.36]  and how easy it is to find all the latest cool tech news there.
[360.42 --> 360.72]  All right.
[360.72 --> 363.58]  So the article from Engadget.
[363.70 --> 364.28]  Will.i.am...
[364.84 --> 365.80]  There he is.
[365.96 --> 367.32]  Like, he's actually wearing it.
[367.50 --> 368.34]  This isn't like...
[368.34 --> 371.00]  This isn't like Kanye coming up with,
[371.40 --> 373.44]  Hey, I invented the white t-shirt.
[373.70 --> 374.06]  And...
[374.06 --> 374.34]  Okay.
[374.56 --> 375.88]  Actually, it is kind of...
[375.88 --> 377.40]  It's kind of the same.
[377.46 --> 379.90]  Or at least it's not different in the way that I was presenting it.
[379.94 --> 380.64]  I was gonna say,
[380.96 --> 383.44]  You know, it's not like Kanye claiming to invent the white t-shirt,
[383.54 --> 385.20]  but actually he didn't invent a t-shirt.
[385.60 --> 385.92]  But he...
[385.92 --> 387.66]  I mean, he did, I guess.
[387.74 --> 390.72]  He did create this white t-shirt that you could buy and spend a lot of money on.
[390.94 --> 394.24]  But this isn't like just some random claim.
[394.62 --> 398.22]  He's actually wearing the thing and talking about it.
[398.46 --> 400.84]  So he started the company himself.
[401.24 --> 401.52]  Okay.
[401.68 --> 402.26]  Funded it.
[402.42 --> 404.16]  Used his own money to develop it.
[404.16 --> 407.78]  It can apparently stream stored music via Bluetooth
[407.78 --> 411.82]  and make calls and access Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram
[411.82 --> 415.94]  without having to connect to a smartphone.
[418.34 --> 420.46]  I'm really interested to see how this works.
[420.58 --> 424.64]  A lot of this stuff does potentially make sense,
[424.68 --> 426.44]  being able to stream music via Bluetooth.
[426.66 --> 430.02]  So if it was like a Bluetooth player
[430.02 --> 433.42]  that you could then use like your Jaybirds or something like that
[433.42 --> 435.70]  to play music over, then okay.
[435.70 --> 438.54]  But if you're going to be able to make calls on it
[438.54 --> 440.00]  without having to connect to a smartphone,
[440.16 --> 443.50]  hey, maybe there's a reason that Intel named Will.i.am.
[443.56 --> 447.38]  It's Director of Creative Innovation back in January 2011.
[448.08 --> 449.96]  So, you know, he's...
[449.96 --> 455.44]  It's not like he's just so far out there in imagination land
[455.44 --> 458.70]  that serious companies like Intel are ignoring him.
[458.70 --> 464.02]  So it's rumored to be coming sometime in the next sort of little while.
[464.58 --> 467.40]  And I will tell you what.
[467.46 --> 470.82]  If you guys want to see it, I will review this.
[471.56 --> 475.36]  So apparently there's a spider behind you.
[476.00 --> 479.16]  Okay, Aldi, if we have any mods, that's a permaban.
[479.44 --> 479.94]  See you later.
[480.12 --> 480.46]  All right.
[480.84 --> 482.64]  Actually, maybe I can just do that.
[483.34 --> 484.58]  Aldi, you're gone.
[485.58 --> 486.84]  You're gone, man.
[487.36 --> 487.76]  Bend.
[487.92 --> 488.80]  Permabend.
[489.08 --> 490.60]  Never going to unban you.
[490.70 --> 491.30]  There you go.
[491.42 --> 491.98]  Yeah.
[492.26 --> 492.50]  Woo.
[492.80 --> 493.22]  All right.
[493.40 --> 495.34]  So let's move on to our next topic here.
[495.48 --> 496.42]  And that is...
[496.42 --> 496.90]  This is...
[496.90 --> 498.68]  Oh, this is such good news.
[499.12 --> 499.46]  All right.
[499.54 --> 501.50]  So I was original...
[501.50 --> 503.10]  I originally had this brought to my attention
[503.10 --> 504.06]  from...
[504.06 --> 505.76]  By an article on PC Per.
[506.20 --> 508.84]  So my bud Ryan Shrout's website
[508.84 --> 511.58]  that I guess he does tech stuff or something.
[511.68 --> 512.56]  I think he makes videos too.
[512.56 --> 515.42]  Anyway, VESA may...
[515.42 --> 516.70]  So this is allegedly...
[516.70 --> 519.84]  May have accepted AMD's FreeSync.
[520.58 --> 521.68]  This is so cool.
[521.80 --> 524.24]  So I made an awful lot of noise
[524.24 --> 525.94]  about NVIDIA's G-Sync
[525.94 --> 527.40]  back when they first showed it off.
[527.82 --> 528.72]  Since then,
[528.86 --> 531.96]  my enthusiasm has naturally somewhat dwindled
[531.96 --> 533.00]  to the point where it's like,
[533.10 --> 536.10]  are we ever going to actually get to use this thing?
[536.12 --> 537.86]  Because it's a great technology.
[537.86 --> 539.78]  What G-Sync basically does
[539.78 --> 542.80]  is instead of refreshing your screen
[542.80 --> 544.88]  at a fixed interval, okay?
[545.04 --> 547.20]  And this is particularly important when gaming.
[547.80 --> 551.00]  Instead, it waits for your GPU to render a frame
[551.00 --> 553.14]  and then refreshes whenever it's ready.
[553.36 --> 555.64]  And I've had people message me and say,
[555.64 --> 557.26]  oh, well, that'll be leggier.
[557.48 --> 559.66]  No, actually, it'll be less leggy
[559.66 --> 562.00]  because the problem with this,
[562.10 --> 563.28]  this constant refreshing,
[563.42 --> 567.38]  is either you're going to slow down your GPU.
[567.60 --> 570.42]  Either you're going to have to kind of sit around
[570.42 --> 571.82]  and wait for things
[571.82 --> 573.30]  and then have them be displayed,
[573.30 --> 577.74]  or you are going to have to see partial frames
[577.74 --> 579.30]  one on top of the other
[579.30 --> 580.12]  and you're going to get tearing.
[580.22 --> 581.10]  What G-Sync does
[581.10 --> 583.30]  is it makes sure that the frames are delivered
[583.30 --> 585.64]  as quickly as possible once they're ready
[585.64 --> 588.18]  and that you only get one frame at a time
[588.18 --> 590.02]  rather than like, you know,
[590.14 --> 591.90]  the top of Lara Croft's body here
[591.90 --> 593.42]  and the bottom like over here.
[593.78 --> 594.36]  And you're just like,
[594.42 --> 597.08]  okay, so I could enjoy the bottom or the top separately,
[597.20 --> 598.50]  but not the whole package, right?
[599.06 --> 600.78]  So not that people play games
[600.78 --> 603.76]  just to, you know, scantily clad female lead characters.
[603.88 --> 604.62]  Shame on you!
[604.96 --> 608.74]  Anyway, I forget what I was talking about now.
[608.82 --> 611.92]  Right, so AMD came along
[611.92 --> 614.00]  and at CES,
[614.32 --> 617.84]  they showed off what they were cheekily calling FreeSync.
[617.96 --> 622.08]  Now, FreeSync was basically exactly the same thing
[622.08 --> 624.20]  and that was the ability for the display
[624.20 --> 627.08]  to only refresh when the GPU was ready
[627.08 --> 628.50]  or when something on the screen changed
[628.50 --> 630.66]  because FreeSync was using something
[630.66 --> 633.84]  that was developed for power saving in laptops.
[634.46 --> 637.06]  So NVIDIA's response at the time was,
[637.20 --> 637.98]  well, FreeSync,
[638.38 --> 641.30]  there's the scalers that are being used for this,
[641.42 --> 642.40]  A, they're only in notebooks,
[642.96 --> 646.76]  and B, they're not designed for the type of use case
[646.76 --> 649.04]  that would have it being used constantly.
[649.26 --> 650.36]  I mean, with G-Sync,
[650.44 --> 652.94]  we developed this robust piece of hardware
[652.94 --> 654.30]  that's really future-proof
[654.30 --> 656.92]  and really designed for that kind of a workload.
[657.44 --> 659.46]  Well, FreeSync, yes,
[659.50 --> 661.50]  was a bit of a Frankenstein experiment at the time
[661.50 --> 662.60]  and I see NVIDIA's point,
[662.86 --> 667.06]  but if it becomes part of the DisplayPort 1.2a standard,
[667.60 --> 669.72]  which allegedly it will,
[670.06 --> 673.62]  we could all of a sudden see basically every display
[673.62 --> 678.00]  have this GPU-triggered refreshing enabled on it.
[678.54 --> 679.94]  Holy crap.
[680.18 --> 682.34]  DisplayPort, you just won.
[682.74 --> 683.96]  Like, you just won.
[684.44 --> 686.94]  Not only are you ahead of HDMI
[686.94 --> 691.24]  because HDMI 2.0 is still not existent,
[691.40 --> 692.86]  you can't actually buy anything with it,
[692.92 --> 694.74]  and DisplayPort 1.2 has been available forever
[694.74 --> 696.96]  and already supports 4K at 60Hz,
[696.96 --> 703.38]  now you are going to be in every gaming machine anywhere,
[704.14 --> 705.34]  and rightly so.
[705.62 --> 707.56]  Like, it's just such a shame
[707.56 --> 710.08]  that the Xbox and PlayStation 4
[710.08 --> 712.66]  couldn't have something like this.
[712.74 --> 715.92]  And I'm not even poking fun at the console gamers right now.
[716.00 --> 718.74]  I'm just legitimately sad for them
[718.74 --> 721.38]  because I'm sad for the entire industry
[721.38 --> 724.64]  because as long as you have to keep trying to design games
[724.64 --> 726.44]  to run at like a fixed frame rate,
[726.44 --> 727.10]  which you have to
[727.10 --> 728.36]  because frame rate fluctuations
[728.36 --> 730.98]  will cause either lag or tearing on consoles
[730.98 --> 735.22]  where we're stuck with these constant refresh rate monitors.
[735.64 --> 738.44]  So as long as the games industry has to account for that,
[738.68 --> 740.66]  we can't see them move forward
[740.66 --> 745.08]  and push for a little bit more visual quality.
[745.40 --> 747.88]  And so what if it dips down to 48 frames per second
[747.88 --> 749.00]  or 53 frames per second
[749.00 --> 751.26]  because it'll still look really good and really smooth
[751.26 --> 753.14]  because that is something that G-Sync
[753.14 --> 759.40]  and by extension, I suppose, FreeSync will do very, very well.
[759.68 --> 762.80]  So fantastic news right there.
[763.24 --> 766.22]  Next up is Android TV.
[766.70 --> 769.18]  So The Verge got an exclusive scoop here
[769.18 --> 771.54]  where they are showing off
[771.54 --> 774.48]  what appears to be the interface of Android TV.
[774.48 --> 777.76]  And what I thought was one of the most interesting things
[777.76 --> 779.22]  about this article
[779.22 --> 784.92]  was how little information it actually seemed to contain.
[785.14 --> 789.08]  So we've got quotes from Google saying things like,
[789.14 --> 790.76]  here, let me just track this down.
[792.20 --> 796.58]  Android TV is an entertainment interface,
[796.58 --> 798.90]  not a computing platform.
[798.90 --> 802.30]  It's all about finding and enjoying content
[802.30 --> 804.10]  with the least amount of friction.
[805.44 --> 807.58]  What does that mean?
[810.38 --> 813.28]  I mean, we saw Google TV in the past.
[813.38 --> 815.20]  I mean, that was a total disaster
[815.20 --> 818.54]  just because, I mean, I think they made claims.
[818.58 --> 819.88]  This is in The Verge article as well.
[819.96 --> 821.08]  So they made claims like
[821.08 --> 824.54]  the majority of TVs in 2012 would ship with Google TV.
[824.54 --> 828.20]  But what was the difference?
[828.30 --> 830.36]  Like, I understand some of the things they're saying here.
[830.42 --> 832.52]  So they want the interface to be cinematic,
[833.00 --> 834.46]  fun, fluid, and fast.
[834.76 --> 836.98]  And they want no more than,
[837.04 --> 838.98]  I think they're saying three clicks
[838.98 --> 841.60]  in order to go from turning it on
[841.60 --> 843.26]  to actually watching content,
[843.34 --> 844.48]  which I think is really cool.
[844.96 --> 845.92]  But beyond that,
[846.04 --> 848.02]  what is the actual difference
[848.02 --> 850.94]  between a set-top box that plugs into your TV
[850.94 --> 853.52]  that is an entertainment interface
[853.52 --> 856.32]  and a set-top box that plugs into your TV
[856.32 --> 858.18]  that is a computing platform?
[858.62 --> 860.02]  If anything, I would say
[860.02 --> 861.00]  if you're going to call something
[861.00 --> 862.12]  an entertainment interface,
[862.34 --> 864.44]  it would be something more like Chromecast,
[864.56 --> 867.30]  where you'll have specific apps developed for it.
[867.32 --> 869.34]  But really, it's more about the experience
[869.34 --> 871.56]  and not about the Chromecast actually being
[871.56 --> 873.04]  a computing platform,
[873.14 --> 874.26]  a powerful piece of hardware.
[874.46 --> 876.62]  And right now, it's not clear
[876.62 --> 880.88]  how Android TV is going to slot into the whole ecosystem
[880.88 --> 883.64]  or how Chromecast is going to slot into the whole ecosystem.
[883.92 --> 885.62]  But what we do know for now
[885.62 --> 889.02]  is that Chromecast will continue to exist.
[889.62 --> 892.30]  So screenshots are now showing Google's own apps
[892.30 --> 894.58]  like Play Movies and YouTube and Hangouts,
[894.74 --> 897.08]  but there are also third-party apps being shown
[897.08 --> 900.80]  like Vivo, Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, and games.
[900.80 --> 904.20]  So to me, on the surface anyway,
[904.48 --> 905.48]  what this looks like
[905.48 --> 908.38]  is just developers having to make
[908.38 --> 910.50]  multiple different interfaces
[910.50 --> 911.84]  for different Google products
[911.84 --> 913.68]  because there are plenty of set-top boxes.
[914.34 --> 916.46]  Amazon's recent Fire TV
[916.46 --> 918.24]  that use Android,
[918.34 --> 920.20]  although Amazon is a bad example, I guess,
[920.26 --> 922.18]  because it doesn't run stock Android by any stretch.
[922.28 --> 924.12]  But there are Android-based players
[924.12 --> 926.30]  from even small manufacturers like Pevos.
[926.30 --> 928.60]  So you're going to have to have an interface for Android
[928.60 --> 930.74]  that hopefully looks somewhat good on a TV.
[930.86 --> 932.46]  You're going to have to have an interface for Chromecast
[932.46 --> 933.56]  that looks somewhat good on a TV.
[933.78 --> 936.42]  You're going to have to design an interface for Android TV
[936.42 --> 937.74]  that looks good on a TV.
[937.96 --> 942.66]  And it just seems like an awful lot of hassle.
[943.58 --> 945.96]  But maybe they have a better plan this time.
[946.30 --> 948.94]  And maybe all that I'm saying right now
[948.94 --> 951.68]  is going to have nothing to do with anything.
[951.78 --> 954.04]  I see a lot of people complaining about mods in the Twitch chat.
[954.14 --> 955.98]  Sorry, there's not a whole lot I can do about it right now.
[955.98 --> 959.62]  But we do have plans to work out a different chat system
[959.62 --> 961.30]  that's a little bit easier for us to moderate.
[961.54 --> 963.02]  So stay tuned for that.
[963.06 --> 963.46]  All right, guys?
[964.40 --> 964.88]  This.
[965.90 --> 968.82]  This is something that I'm getting pretty tired of,
[968.84 --> 969.80]  this next topic here.
[969.92 --> 972.26]  Now, NVIDIA released a new driver.
[972.72 --> 976.94]  And they came out with all kinds of claims
[976.94 --> 978.14]  with respect to performance.
[978.22 --> 979.14]  So they're basically saying,
[979.26 --> 981.66]  look, we're going to have DirectX 12
[981.66 --> 985.38]  on all of our GPUs that supported DirectX 11 AMD.
[985.38 --> 989.08]  And we're going to release a DirectX 11 driver
[989.08 --> 991.02]  that stomps all over Mantle anyway.
[991.40 --> 992.38]  So here, check this out.
[992.70 --> 994.42]  So screen sharing here.
[994.50 --> 996.16]  This was posted originally on the forum
[996.16 --> 998.22]  by actually a couple of different folks.
[998.28 --> 998.96]  I'll credit them later.
[999.02 --> 1001.94]  But the 337.50 beta driver
[1001.94 --> 1003.82]  was claiming that it would deliver
[1003.82 --> 1007.52]  up to 64% faster single GPU performance
[1007.52 --> 1010.60]  and up to 71% faster SLI performance
[1010.60 --> 1015.20]  just through optimizing the DirectX 11 driver
[1015.20 --> 1016.46]  that's available now.
[1016.46 --> 1021.12]  Now, I have heard members of the press
[1021.12 --> 1022.86]  muttering under their breath,
[1023.28 --> 1024.24]  talking to each other,
[1024.34 --> 1025.48]  not going to name any names,
[1025.48 --> 1029.38]  about every time AMD or NVIDIA
[1029.38 --> 1031.28]  releases a big driver update
[1031.28 --> 1035.54]  that claims to completely turn the world inside out
[1035.54 --> 1038.10]  by delivering amazing new performance
[1038.10 --> 1040.40]  to the existing GPUs that they produce.
[1040.98 --> 1043.52]  And the comments go a little something like this.
[1044.64 --> 1048.24]  Maybe, maybe they'll actually have changed something
[1048.24 --> 1050.34]  a lot this time, but I doubt it.
[1050.34 --> 1052.84]  And I even heard one of them talking directly
[1052.84 --> 1054.30]  to either AMD or NVIDIA,
[1054.36 --> 1055.72]  not going to name any names here,
[1055.82 --> 1058.42]  saying, look, if I spend the time
[1058.42 --> 1059.54]  to benchmark this thing,
[1059.74 --> 1061.86]  am I actually going to find this number you're claiming
[1061.86 --> 1063.94]  or is it just a waste of my time again?
[1064.62 --> 1068.42]  So the press in general is a little bit sick
[1068.42 --> 1071.36]  of the whole claims that don't really seem to add up thing.
[1071.82 --> 1076.78]  And unfortunately, it looks like this is maybe more of the same.
[1076.80 --> 1077.82]  Okay, there are improvements,
[1077.82 --> 1080.94]  but there might be a little bit more of the same going on here.
[1081.04 --> 1084.56]  So we referenced articles from two of my favorite sites.
[1084.68 --> 1086.10]  We actually didn't have the time,
[1086.46 --> 1087.34]  just didn't have the bandwidth
[1087.34 --> 1088.58]  to run the benchmarks ourselves,
[1088.70 --> 1090.32]  but these are both very trustworthy sources.
[1090.60 --> 1092.68]  Trust me that they're good for it, I guess.
[1093.10 --> 1095.16]  So Anantec and PCPer.
[1095.28 --> 1097.94]  So they both did pretty darn good articles
[1097.94 --> 1099.44]  on the new NVIDIA driver
[1099.44 --> 1102.04]  and the conclusions from both of them
[1102.04 --> 1103.68]  basically amounted to this.
[1103.68 --> 1108.68]  Anantec's test indicated about a 10% improvement
[1108.68 --> 1110.24]  in performance in Bioshock Infinite
[1110.24 --> 1111.18]  and Metro Last Light.
[1111.76 --> 1114.76]  SLI performance increased 10% for Grid 2
[1114.76 --> 1117.88]  and 76% for Total War Rome 2,
[1118.06 --> 1121.56]  although Total War Rome 2,
[1122.06 --> 1124.68]  you know, was pretty far back
[1124.68 --> 1125.56]  in terms of optimization.
[1125.56 --> 1127.56]  So anyway, a 76%,
[1127.56 --> 1128.68]  that means they did achieve it.
[1128.74 --> 1130.16]  So 76% performance improvement
[1130.16 --> 1132.18]  in a particular game is good.
[1132.78 --> 1135.08]  NVIDIA boasts huge performance gains
[1135.08 --> 1136.10]  in older games.
[1136.42 --> 1136.96]  So, you know,
[1137.12 --> 1139.04]  Call of Duty Black Ops is getting 20%,
[1139.04 --> 1139.68]  I guess.
[1140.02 --> 1141.52]  And, you know,
[1142.26 --> 1146.28]  SLI has seen slight performance increases.
[1146.28 --> 1148.92]  And NVIDIA has been working on,
[1149.04 --> 1149.24]  you know,
[1149.30 --> 1150.62]  some mantle-optimized games
[1150.62 --> 1152.16]  and all this kind of stuff.
[1152.24 --> 1154.28]  But the basic conclusion was that
[1154.28 --> 1156.40]  performance was only really increased
[1156.40 --> 1157.76]  in some pretty specific games.
[1158.06 --> 1159.36]  And for the most part,
[1159.52 --> 1162.04]  the sensationalist headline performance improvements
[1162.04 --> 1164.64]  were pretty difficult to find.
[1165.28 --> 1166.86]  And I guess for me,
[1167.02 --> 1167.28]  this,
[1167.52 --> 1169.96]  it turns into a bit of a
[1169.96 --> 1171.46]  can I trust you issue.
[1171.94 --> 1172.16]  Like,
[1172.24 --> 1173.34]  I don't mind
[1173.34 --> 1175.10]  when NVIDIA provides us
[1175.10 --> 1176.48]  with reference benchmarks
[1176.48 --> 1177.74]  when they release a new GPU.
[1177.92 --> 1178.46]  In general,
[1178.58 --> 1180.18]  they've done a pretty good job of it
[1180.18 --> 1180.60]  where they say,
[1180.72 --> 1180.86]  okay,
[1180.92 --> 1182.38]  if you take our card
[1182.38 --> 1183.74]  and this AMD card
[1183.74 --> 1184.90]  and you run them side by side,
[1184.98 --> 1186.28]  here's about the performance improvement
[1186.28 --> 1186.96]  you can expect.
[1187.16 --> 1187.86]  We're still going to run
[1187.86 --> 1188.78]  our own benchmarks anyway.
[1188.90 --> 1189.84]  We're not just going to take that
[1189.84 --> 1190.64]  at face value.
[1191.18 --> 1191.58]  But,
[1192.24 --> 1192.80]  it's
[1192.80 --> 1194.02]  nice
[1194.02 --> 1195.36]  when they at least give us a reference
[1195.36 --> 1196.66]  so that when we run something
[1196.66 --> 1198.44]  and it's like totally not the same,
[1198.84 --> 1199.76]  we can go back and go,
[1199.84 --> 1200.22]  oh crap,
[1200.28 --> 1201.24]  did we screw something up?
[1201.66 --> 1203.00]  This is,
[1204.06 --> 1205.80]  it just seems like a headline grab
[1205.80 --> 1207.64]  and I find it frustrating
[1207.64 --> 1210.80]  because I had another similar experience
[1210.80 --> 1212.26]  with NVIDIA not that long ago
[1212.26 --> 1214.00]  where I was reviewing a gaming notebook
[1214.00 --> 1218.06]  that had NVIDIA's latest GTX 860M
[1218.06 --> 1219.36]  graphics card in it
[1219.36 --> 1220.78]  and they've got a new feature
[1220.78 --> 1222.32]  that they're calling battery boost
[1222.32 --> 1224.62]  where they're claiming up to two times
[1224.62 --> 1226.00]  the battery performance.
[1226.16 --> 1228.02]  And I mentioned this in my notebook review
[1228.02 --> 1229.00]  where I said,
[1229.00 --> 1231.52]  I got about an extra two minutes of performance,
[1231.92 --> 1233.10]  not two times performance,
[1233.28 --> 1235.14]  although I did admit at the time
[1235.14 --> 1236.86]  that I do need to do a follow-up.
[1237.10 --> 1237.48]  But I mean,
[1237.52 --> 1238.92]  I don't think there was too much
[1238.92 --> 1240.02]  to go wrong with my test
[1240.02 --> 1240.74]  because the way there's,
[1240.84 --> 1242.28]  the technology is supposed to work
[1242.28 --> 1246.12]  is that instead of allowing the notebook GPU
[1246.12 --> 1248.00]  to work as hard as it can
[1248.00 --> 1248.52]  to deliver,
[1248.88 --> 1249.12]  you know,
[1249.16 --> 1250.94]  60 or 70 frames per second,
[1251.18 --> 1253.54]  you can limit the frame rate at like 30
[1253.54 --> 1255.64]  if you're okay with that gaming experience
[1255.64 --> 1256.82]  on battery life
[1256.82 --> 1258.52]  in order to preserve some power.
[1258.52 --> 1260.16]  So I just found a part of Crysis
[1260.16 --> 1263.48]  that normally would run at like 55 frames per second
[1263.48 --> 1264.08]  with battery
[1264.08 --> 1265.24]  or 45 frames per second,
[1265.36 --> 1265.54]  I think,
[1265.62 --> 1266.28]  with battery.
[1266.62 --> 1267.92]  And then I turned the limiter on
[1267.92 --> 1269.06]  to 30 frames per second
[1269.06 --> 1270.28]  and I just left it there
[1270.28 --> 1271.48]  with a time-lapse camera on it
[1271.48 --> 1272.68]  and the battery died
[1272.68 --> 1273.38]  and it shut off
[1273.38 --> 1274.92]  and it only was about two minutes difference.
[1275.30 --> 1275.32]  So,
[1276.62 --> 1282.28]  I don't know.
[1282.70 --> 1283.82]  I don't know what else there is
[1283.82 --> 1284.86]  for me to really say about it
[1284.86 --> 1286.90]  other than I just find that pretty frustrating.
[1287.24 --> 1287.36]  So,
[1287.84 --> 1288.62]  I'm going to go ahead
[1288.62 --> 1290.56]  and add at least one mod here.
[1290.90 --> 1291.48]  There we go.
[1292.06 --> 1292.54]  Boom!
[1292.64 --> 1294.20]  I have added a moderator.
[1294.52 --> 1294.68]  So,
[1295.10 --> 1296.92]  I don't think one mod is going to be enough
[1296.92 --> 1297.46]  and like I said,
[1297.52 --> 1298.48]  we're working on a solution
[1298.48 --> 1299.40]  but there you go.
[1300.22 --> 1300.52]  Alright.
[1300.92 --> 1301.98]  Now this next thing
[1301.98 --> 1304.42]  is something that is pretty,
[1304.66 --> 1306.08]  pretty close to,
[1306.22 --> 1306.66]  to me
[1306.66 --> 1308.62]  because I do make videos
[1308.62 --> 1309.50]  for a living now.
[1309.88 --> 1311.38]  This is from
[1311.38 --> 1312.78]  NAB 2014
[1312.78 --> 1313.82]  and it is the
[1313.82 --> 1315.16]  Blackmagic URSA
[1315.16 --> 1317.86]  Upgradable 4K Digital Film Camera.
[1317.94 --> 1318.12]  Now,
[1318.50 --> 1319.80]  you guys might ask yourselves,
[1319.94 --> 1320.70]  for those of you
[1320.70 --> 1322.04]  who aren't that familiar
[1322.04 --> 1322.60]  with,
[1322.68 --> 1322.92]  you know,
[1323.02 --> 1323.66]  film equipment,
[1324.06 --> 1325.52]  why do we still call it
[1325.52 --> 1326.58]  a film camera?
[1326.70 --> 1326.84]  Like,
[1326.88 --> 1328.36]  what does that actually mean?
[1328.74 --> 1329.86]  That means that
[1329.86 --> 1331.18]  they are trying to achieve
[1331.18 --> 1333.00]  a more film-like look
[1333.00 --> 1333.48]  which
[1333.48 --> 1335.22]  many content creators
[1335.22 --> 1336.08]  still agree
[1336.08 --> 1336.90]  is better
[1336.90 --> 1337.82]  than that
[1337.82 --> 1338.46]  digital
[1338.46 --> 1339.72]  camcorder feel
[1339.72 --> 1340.26]  that you get
[1340.26 --> 1340.82]  with a lot of
[1340.82 --> 1341.62]  digital solutions.
[1341.84 --> 1342.00]  So,
[1342.34 --> 1343.22]  products like the
[1343.22 --> 1344.06]  Arri Alexa,
[1344.38 --> 1345.00]  which actually
[1345.00 --> 1345.92]  isn't even
[1345.92 --> 1347.18]  a 4K camera,
[1347.98 --> 1348.58]  so I'm going to let
[1348.58 --> 1349.10]  that sink in,
[1349.20 --> 1350.02]  but gets used
[1350.02 --> 1351.66]  for video production,
[1351.86 --> 1353.00]  for feature films.
[1353.10 --> 1353.76]  It's not even
[1353.76 --> 1355.18]  a 4K digital camera.
[1355.64 --> 1356.64]  What they've achieved
[1356.64 --> 1357.12]  with that
[1357.12 --> 1358.66]  is a film look
[1358.66 --> 1359.58]  and a color
[1359.58 --> 1360.34]  and,
[1360.34 --> 1360.68]  and,
[1360.74 --> 1361.66]  and a feel
[1361.66 --> 1362.24]  to it
[1362.24 --> 1363.40]  that is closer
[1363.40 --> 1364.06]  to film
[1364.06 --> 1364.74]  while
[1364.74 --> 1366.72]  avoiding the pitfalls
[1366.72 --> 1367.20]  of film
[1367.20 --> 1368.18]  which are mostly
[1368.18 --> 1369.04]  that it's cumbersome
[1369.04 --> 1369.60]  to work with
[1369.60 --> 1370.14]  and that it is
[1370.14 --> 1371.96]  extremely expensive.
[1372.10 --> 1372.70]  That's number one.
[1373.08 --> 1373.34]  So,
[1373.46 --> 1374.44]  what Blackmagic's
[1374.44 --> 1375.24]  trying to do here
[1375.24 --> 1376.08]  is create
[1376.08 --> 1377.64]  a 4K camera
[1377.64 --> 1378.68]  that is kind of
[1378.68 --> 1379.64]  ENG size.
[1379.72 --> 1379.82]  So,
[1379.88 --> 1379.96]  like,
[1379.98 --> 1380.56]  you know those ones
[1380.56 --> 1381.74]  for like newscaster,
[1381.88 --> 1382.40]  news crews
[1382.40 --> 1383.26]  that they carry around
[1383.26 --> 1383.66]  on the,
[1383.66 --> 1384.42]  on the shoulder mount.
[1384.48 --> 1384.56]  So,
[1384.60 --> 1384.90]  it's about
[1384.90 --> 1385.84]  ENG size
[1385.84 --> 1386.74]  and
[1386.74 --> 1388.42]  not just
[1388.42 --> 1389.14]  big
[1389.14 --> 1389.82]  but also
[1389.82 --> 1391.14]  incredibly feature rich.
[1391.22 --> 1391.32]  So,
[1391.36 --> 1392.16]  they are allowing
[1392.16 --> 1393.06]  upgradable
[1393.06 --> 1394.02]  sensors,
[1394.78 --> 1395.46]  upgradable
[1395.46 --> 1396.44]  lens mounts.
[1396.44 --> 1398.82]  It has a 10 inch display
[1398.82 --> 1400.20]  built into one side of it.
[1400.32 --> 1401.94]  It has two additional displays.
[1402.44 --> 1402.66]  So,
[1402.84 --> 1403.74]  aside from being used
[1403.74 --> 1404.58]  for ENG use,
[1404.62 --> 1405.26]  it could be used
[1405.26 --> 1406.56]  on like a,
[1406.56 --> 1407.30]  a multi,
[1407.78 --> 1407.98]  you know,
[1408.02 --> 1409.76]  with a multi-person crew
[1409.76 --> 1411.22]  on a video production set
[1411.22 --> 1411.96]  for commercials
[1411.96 --> 1413.18]  or even feature films
[1413.18 --> 1414.38]  with like one person
[1414.38 --> 1415.36]  monitoring scopes
[1415.36 --> 1416.14]  on one side
[1416.14 --> 1416.78]  and one person
[1416.78 --> 1418.16]  monitoring what the lens
[1418.16 --> 1419.04]  is actually looking at
[1419.04 --> 1419.72]  on the other side.
[1419.82 --> 1419.92]  Like,
[1419.94 --> 1420.86]  up to three people
[1420.86 --> 1422.38]  working per camera.
[1422.50 --> 1422.94]  It's got all these
[1422.94 --> 1423.72]  screens on it.
[1423.96 --> 1425.12]  It's got professional
[1425.12 --> 1426.00]  quality inputs
[1426.00 --> 1426.52]  and outputs.
[1426.70 --> 1426.78]  So,
[1426.82 --> 1428.58]  it has 12G SDI
[1428.58 --> 1430.32]  which means that
[1430.32 --> 1431.18]  you can basically
[1431.18 --> 1432.20]  output directly
[1432.20 --> 1433.16]  with one cable,
[1433.30 --> 1433.76]  4K.
[1434.10 --> 1434.76]  It supports
[1434.76 --> 1435.74]  internal dual
[1435.74 --> 1436.36]  RAW
[1436.36 --> 1437.40]  and ProRes
[1437.40 --> 1437.98]  recorders.
[1438.02 --> 1438.10]  So,
[1438.14 --> 1438.64]  it's using the
[1438.64 --> 1439.04]  upcoming
[1439.04 --> 1439.96]  CFast
[1439.96 --> 1440.68]  standard
[1440.68 --> 1441.30]  that's kind of
[1441.30 --> 1441.92]  like an extension
[1441.92 --> 1442.92]  of compact flash.
[1443.26 --> 1443.36]  So,
[1443.42 --> 1444.24]  unlike the cinema camera,
[1444.32 --> 1445.22]  it doesn't use SSDs
[1445.22 --> 1445.98]  but at least this is
[1445.98 --> 1447.16]  a standard media
[1447.16 --> 1448.42]  as opposed to
[1448.42 --> 1449.28]  a lot of
[1449.28 --> 1450.12]  recording solutions
[1450.12 --> 1450.56]  that use
[1450.56 --> 1451.48]  proprietary media.
[1451.60 --> 1451.88]  In fact,
[1451.94 --> 1452.96]  the one that we use
[1452.96 --> 1454.18]  for our Sony camera
[1454.18 --> 1455.94]  uses proprietary SSDs.
[1456.30 --> 1456.40]  So,
[1456.48 --> 1457.38]  it's a firmware lock
[1457.38 --> 1457.94]  that doesn't allow
[1457.94 --> 1458.76]  us to use other things
[1458.76 --> 1460.22]  and then it's got,
[1460.28 --> 1460.46]  you know,
[1460.54 --> 1461.36]  XLR input.
[1461.70 --> 1462.30]  It's got,
[1462.48 --> 1462.60]  so,
[1462.64 --> 1463.36]  the two 5-inch
[1463.36 --> 1463.88]  touchscreens
[1463.88 --> 1464.60]  that are on both
[1464.60 --> 1465.32]  sides of the camera
[1465.32 --> 1466.04]  so you can put
[1466.04 --> 1466.46]  your settings,
[1466.60 --> 1466.92]  controls,
[1467.06 --> 1467.88]  monitoring tools there
[1467.88 --> 1468.84]  and then the big one
[1468.84 --> 1469.52]  is the upgradable
[1469.52 --> 1469.84]  sensor.
[1469.96 --> 1470.06]  So,
[1470.14 --> 1470.92]  it comes in at only
[1470.92 --> 1471.70]  $6,000
[1471.70 --> 1472.62]  which sounds like
[1472.62 --> 1473.06]  a lot of money
[1473.06 --> 1473.58]  to you guys
[1473.58 --> 1474.12]  but to put this
[1474.12 --> 1474.72]  in perspective,
[1475.26 --> 1476.42]  the Sony FS700
[1476.42 --> 1478.60]  was around that price
[1478.60 --> 1479.16]  when we bought it.
[1479.20 --> 1479.62]  I think around
[1479.62 --> 1480.38]  $7,000
[1480.38 --> 1481.36]  when we bought it.
[1481.78 --> 1482.92]  It has a 4K sensor
[1482.92 --> 1484.48]  in it but it's only
[1484.48 --> 1485.46]  capable of recording
[1485.46 --> 1486.76]  directly to 1080p
[1486.76 --> 1487.58]  without an expensive
[1487.58 --> 1488.28]  firmware upgrade
[1488.28 --> 1488.98]  and an expensive
[1488.98 --> 1489.90]  external recorder.
[1490.24 --> 1490.42]  So,
[1490.52 --> 1491.10]  our camera
[1491.10 --> 1492.62]  has actually cost us
[1492.62 --> 1493.86]  well over $10,000
[1493.86 --> 1494.72]  by the time we're
[1494.72 --> 1495.74]  actually shooting 4K
[1495.74 --> 1496.08]  with it
[1496.08 --> 1496.80]  which we aren't even
[1496.80 --> 1497.52]  able to yet
[1497.52 --> 1498.00]  because we're still
[1498.00 --> 1498.62]  waiting for another
[1498.62 --> 1499.18]  firmware update
[1499.18 --> 1499.74]  for our recorder
[1499.74 --> 1500.18]  but that's a whole
[1500.18 --> 1500.60]  other story.
[1500.86 --> 1501.02]  So,
[1501.08 --> 1502.32]  this is only $6,000
[1502.32 --> 1504.10]  records to 4K
[1504.10 --> 1505.02]  immediately.
[1505.42 --> 1506.16]  You can upgrade
[1506.16 --> 1506.78]  the sensor
[1506.78 --> 1508.22]  to future standards
[1508.22 --> 1509.54]  like 6K,
[1509.62 --> 1510.00]  8K
[1510.00 --> 1510.66]  or whatever.
[1510.96 --> 1511.74]  You can upgrade
[1511.74 --> 1512.30]  the mount
[1512.30 --> 1512.90]  to put different
[1512.90 --> 1513.74]  lenses on it
[1513.74 --> 1515.34]  and it just
[1515.34 --> 1516.50]  freaking blew my
[1516.50 --> 1517.30]  mind and the fact
[1517.30 --> 1517.76]  that it uses
[1517.76 --> 1518.62]  open standards
[1518.62 --> 1519.32]  and comes in
[1519.32 --> 1520.30]  at only $6,000
[1520.30 --> 1523.02]  is just unreal.
[1524.36 --> 1524.78]  I'm going to head
[1524.78 --> 1525.54]  over to Twitch chat
[1525.54 --> 1526.92]  and see if things
[1526.92 --> 1528.00]  have sort of
[1528.00 --> 1529.76]  gotten a little bit
[1529.76 --> 1531.26]  less out of control.
[1531.44 --> 1531.64]  Yes,
[1531.68 --> 1532.68]  indeed they have
[1532.68 --> 1533.24]  in fact.
[1533.36 --> 1533.60]  Alright,
[1533.74 --> 1534.24]  let's move on
[1534.24 --> 1534.92]  to our next topic
[1534.92 --> 1535.06]  here.
[1535.10 --> 1535.54]  I think this is
[1535.54 --> 1535.88]  going to be a
[1535.88 --> 1536.70]  pretty short show
[1536.70 --> 1537.74]  just because
[1537.74 --> 1538.62]  there's not
[1538.62 --> 1539.36]  a whole lot
[1539.36 --> 1539.74]  of room
[1539.74 --> 1540.90]  for discussion
[1540.90 --> 1541.84]  between me
[1541.84 --> 1542.60]  and Luke
[1542.60 --> 1543.06]  over here.
[1543.34 --> 1543.70]  So,
[1543.76 --> 1544.36]  this is a cool
[1544.36 --> 1544.64]  demo.
[1544.76 --> 1544.98]  Now,
[1545.22 --> 1545.84]  one of the
[1545.84 --> 1546.64]  things that
[1546.64 --> 1547.66]  I have
[1547.66 --> 1548.68]  criticized
[1548.68 --> 1549.40]  Thunderbolt
[1549.40 --> 1550.40]  for is
[1550.40 --> 1550.92]  that it
[1550.92 --> 1552.32]  just isn't
[1552.32 --> 1553.34]  Ethernet.
[1553.72 --> 1554.38]  It doesn't
[1554.38 --> 1555.06]  allow the
[1555.06 --> 1555.54]  same kind
[1555.54 --> 1556.28]  of flexibility
[1556.28 --> 1557.28]  that Ethernet
[1557.28 --> 1558.08]  does in a
[1558.08 --> 1558.68]  multi-user
[1558.68 --> 1559.24]  scenario.
[1559.44 --> 1559.54]  So,
[1559.62 --> 1560.90]  having 10
[1560.90 --> 1561.74]  gigabit Ethernet
[1561.74 --> 1562.54]  on my PC
[1562.54 --> 1563.50]  to me
[1563.50 --> 1564.04]  is more
[1564.04 --> 1564.54]  important
[1564.54 --> 1565.08]  than paying
[1565.08 --> 1565.60]  a premium
[1565.60 --> 1566.72]  for a
[1566.72 --> 1567.12]  Thunderbolt
[1567.12 --> 1567.96]  enabled PC
[1567.96 --> 1569.04]  and then paying
[1569.04 --> 1570.08]  another premium
[1570.08 --> 1570.62]  for a
[1570.62 --> 1571.12]  Thunderbolt
[1571.12 --> 1572.22]  enabled storage
[1572.22 --> 1572.70]  enclosure.
[1572.92 --> 1572.96]  Well,
[1573.06 --> 1573.46]  now,
[1573.96 --> 1574.98]  Thunderbolt 2
[1574.98 --> 1576.22]  has been shown
[1576.22 --> 1577.22]  off enabling
[1577.22 --> 1578.38]  a 10 gigabit
[1578.38 --> 1578.86]  per second
[1578.86 --> 1579.94]  Ethernet connection
[1579.94 --> 1581.00]  between,
[1581.42 --> 1582.06]  not only
[1582.06 --> 1582.52]  from Mac
[1582.52 --> 1582.98]  to Mac,
[1583.16 --> 1583.82]  but between
[1583.82 --> 1584.62]  a Mac
[1584.62 --> 1585.72]  and a PC.
[1586.38 --> 1586.54]  So,
[1586.66 --> 1587.34]  now,
[1587.70 --> 1588.12]  your Mac
[1588.12 --> 1588.84]  Pro with
[1588.84 --> 1589.58]  its six
[1589.58 --> 1590.26]  Thunderbolt 2
[1590.26 --> 1590.76]  connections
[1590.76 --> 1591.68]  and,
[1591.68 --> 1592.34]  you know,
[1592.40 --> 1592.92]  Gigabyte for
[1592.92 --> 1593.32]  example,
[1593.64 --> 1594.32]  so your PC
[1594.32 --> 1594.74]  motherboard
[1595.60 --> 1596.62]  dual Thunderbolt
[1596.62 --> 1597.16]  connections,
[1597.78 --> 1598.20]  now,
[1598.34 --> 1598.96]  all of a sudden,
[1599.04 --> 1599.88]  you can create
[1599.88 --> 1601.42]  a super-fast network
[1601.42 --> 1602.42]  that can connect
[1602.42 --> 1603.24]  to Thunderbolt
[1603.24 --> 1604.68]  enabled expansion
[1604.68 --> 1605.64]  devices such as
[1605.64 --> 1605.96]  storage.
[1606.08 --> 1606.52]  This makes
[1606.52 --> 1607.40]  Thunderbolt a much
[1607.40 --> 1608.62]  more feasible
[1608.62 --> 1609.46]  option to me
[1609.46 --> 1610.24]  because a lot
[1610.24 --> 1611.00]  of what we do
[1611.00 --> 1612.72]  is in a multi-user
[1612.72 --> 1614.04]  working environment
[1614.04 --> 1614.68]  where everyone
[1614.68 --> 1615.50]  needs to access
[1615.50 --> 1616.50]  the same resources
[1616.50 --> 1617.48]  at the same time.
[1617.82 --> 1618.78]  And for that reason,
[1619.26 --> 1620.30]  Thunderbolt has just
[1620.30 --> 1621.62]  made no sense to me
[1621.62 --> 1622.44]  and the Mac Pro
[1622.44 --> 1623.12]  in particular
[1623.12 --> 1624.00]  has made no sense
[1624.00 --> 1624.50]  to me because
[1624.50 --> 1625.24]  it cannot be
[1625.24 --> 1626.24]  expanded to
[1626.24 --> 1627.06]  10 gig Ethernet
[1627.06 --> 1628.14]  without buying
[1628.14 --> 1628.72]  a Thunderbolt
[1628.72 --> 1629.32]  enclosure,
[1629.56 --> 1629.98]  Thunderbolt to
[1629.98 --> 1630.48]  PCI Express
[1630.48 --> 1630.96]  enclosure,
[1631.32 --> 1631.88]  and then putting
[1631.88 --> 1632.58]  a 10 gig
[1632.58 --> 1633.54]  Ethernet card
[1633.54 --> 1633.86]  in there.
[1633.96 --> 1634.10]  Now,
[1634.16 --> 1634.74]  you're adapting
[1634.74 --> 1635.56]  this to that
[1635.56 --> 1636.00]  to that
[1636.00 --> 1636.52]  to that
[1636.52 --> 1637.42]  in order to
[1637.42 --> 1638.40]  just access
[1638.40 --> 1639.60]  a network resource
[1639.60 --> 1640.44]  because it only
[1640.44 --> 1641.28]  has one gigabit
[1641.28 --> 1642.02]  Ethernet built
[1642.02 --> 1642.46]  into it.
[1642.52 --> 1642.60]  Well,
[1642.68 --> 1643.02]  now,
[1643.46 --> 1643.80]  Thunderbolt
[1643.80 --> 1644.24]  looks a little
[1644.24 --> 1644.88]  bit more feasible.
[1645.04 --> 1645.14]  Now,
[1645.22 --> 1645.82]  I do see
[1645.82 --> 1646.52]  some negative
[1646.52 --> 1647.20]  comments
[1647.20 --> 1648.12]  about this
[1648.12 --> 1648.66]  technology
[1648.66 --> 1650.10]  and one person
[1650.10 --> 1650.96]  put it pretty well
[1650.96 --> 1651.38]  and said,
[1651.38 --> 1651.96]  well,
[1651.96 --> 1652.80]  this is ridiculous.
[1653.28 --> 1653.72]  We're moving
[1653.72 --> 1654.98]  away from
[1654.98 --> 1656.34]  centralized switching
[1656.34 --> 1656.82]  and we're going
[1656.82 --> 1657.24]  back to what?
[1657.32 --> 1658.06]  Like token ring?
[1658.46 --> 1659.24]  So you actually
[1659.24 --> 1660.14]  have to network
[1660.14 --> 1661.68]  each computer
[1661.68 --> 1662.74]  on a network.
[1662.88 --> 1663.06]  You have to
[1663.06 --> 1663.44]  like kind of
[1663.44 --> 1664.02]  daisy chain
[1664.02 --> 1664.68]  them all together
[1664.68 --> 1665.26]  which feels
[1665.26 --> 1666.06]  kind of stupid
[1666.06 --> 1666.96]  but,
[1667.96 --> 1668.50]  and I see
[1668.50 --> 1669.10]  that point
[1669.10 --> 1670.02]  but I also
[1670.02 --> 1670.94]  see this as
[1670.94 --> 1671.96]  a pretty good
[1671.96 --> 1673.30]  intermediary solution
[1673.30 --> 1673.86]  for folks
[1673.86 --> 1674.58]  that don't want
[1674.58 --> 1675.08]  to drop
[1675.08 --> 1675.66]  you know,
[1675.88 --> 1676.70]  300 to 500
[1676.70 --> 1677.58]  bucks per adapter
[1677.58 --> 1678.38]  on 10 gigabit
[1678.38 --> 1679.12]  Ethernet cards
[1679.12 --> 1680.46]  and then
[1680.46 --> 1681.22]  build themselves
[1681.22 --> 1681.70]  a NAS
[1681.70 --> 1682.32]  or whatever else.
[1682.40 --> 1682.70]  So now you can
[1682.70 --> 1683.08]  just buy a
[1683.08 --> 1683.38]  Thunderbolt
[1683.38 --> 1683.76]  enclosure
[1683.76 --> 1684.30]  and go ahead
[1684.30 --> 1685.44]  and do that.
[1685.56 --> 1686.22]  So they showed
[1686.22 --> 1687.08]  off transfer speeds
[1687.08 --> 1688.38]  of 150 megabytes
[1688.38 --> 1688.90]  per second
[1688.90 --> 1689.22]  which,
[1689.70 --> 1690.72]  not actually
[1690.72 --> 1692.16]  that impressive
[1692.16 --> 1692.94]  we'd be looking
[1692.94 --> 1693.20]  at.
[1693.34 --> 1693.86]  We would want
[1693.86 --> 1695.20]  wait a minute
[1695.20 --> 1695.54]  hold on
[1695.54 --> 1696.28]  yeah,
[1696.46 --> 1697.28]  we'd want to see
[1697.28 --> 1697.94]  quite a bit higher
[1697.94 --> 1698.42]  than that
[1698.42 --> 1699.24]  for 10 gigabit
[1699.24 --> 1700.36]  but at least
[1700.36 --> 1701.24]  it's handled
[1701.24 --> 1702.32]  or at least
[1702.32 --> 1702.92]  it's working.
[1703.70 --> 1704.08]  Now,
[1705.02 --> 1705.76]  in line with
[1705.76 --> 1706.30]  the whole
[1706.30 --> 1706.98]  Thunderbolt
[1706.98 --> 1707.54]  expansion
[1707.54 --> 1708.34]  versus internal
[1708.34 --> 1708.88]  expansion
[1708.88 --> 1709.74]  conversation
[1709.74 --> 1710.32]  that inevitably
[1710.32 --> 1710.88]  comes up
[1710.88 --> 1711.24]  whenever we
[1711.24 --> 1711.68]  talk about
[1711.68 --> 1712.18]  Mac these
[1712.18 --> 1712.52]  days
[1712.52 --> 1713.74]  we actually
[1713.74 --> 1714.20]  have a
[1714.20 --> 1714.98]  Hackintosh
[1714.98 --> 1715.78]  build guide
[1715.78 --> 1716.46]  coming very
[1716.46 --> 1716.88]  soon
[1716.88 --> 1717.50]  and I'm
[1717.50 --> 1717.74]  going to
[1717.74 --> 1718.28]  cover this
[1718.28 --> 1718.86]  in quite a
[1718.86 --> 1719.16]  bit more
[1719.16 --> 1719.46]  depth
[1719.46 --> 1719.80]  in that
[1719.80 --> 1720.16]  video
[1720.16 --> 1720.62]  but
[1720.62 --> 1722.32]  in that
[1722.32 --> 1722.90]  build guide
[1722.90 --> 1723.28]  I guess
[1723.28 --> 1723.52]  I,
[1723.68 --> 1724.06]  you know
[1724.06 --> 1724.70]  I have
[1724.70 --> 1725.12]  notes in
[1725.12 --> 1725.26]  here
[1725.26 --> 1725.48]  that I
[1725.48 --> 1725.80]  wanted to
[1725.80 --> 1726.18]  talk about
[1726.18 --> 1726.32]  that
[1726.32 --> 1726.52]  but I
[1726.52 --> 1726.66]  guess
[1726.66 --> 1726.78]  I
[1726.78 --> 1726.94]  kind
[1726.94 --> 1727.02]  of
[1727.02 --> 1727.20]  talked
[1727.20 --> 1727.38]  about
[1727.38 --> 1727.48]  it
[1727.48 --> 1727.76]  already
[1727.76 --> 1728.06]  because
[1728.06 --> 1728.22]  I
[1728.22 --> 1728.44]  talk
[1728.44 --> 1728.74]  about
[1728.74 --> 1729.20]  the
[1729.20 --> 1729.66]  merits
[1729.66 --> 1730.16]  of
[1730.16 --> 1730.56]  Thunderbolt
[1730.56 --> 1731.06]  expansion
[1731.06 --> 1731.58]  versus
[1731.58 --> 1732.26]  PCI
[1732.26 --> 1732.62]  Express
[1732.62 --> 1733.10]  expansion
[1733.10 --> 1733.60]  and how
[1733.60 --> 1734.74]  one can
[1734.74 --> 1735.52]  be beneficial
[1735.52 --> 1735.86]  or the
[1735.86 --> 1736.00]  other
[1736.00 --> 1736.24]  can be
[1736.24 --> 1736.60]  beneficial
[1736.60 --> 1737.00]  but I
[1737.00 --> 1737.18]  guess
[1737.18 --> 1737.38]  I'll
[1737.38 --> 1737.54]  just
[1737.54 --> 1737.70]  do
[1737.70 --> 1737.90]  this
[1737.90 --> 1738.12]  then
[1738.12 --> 1738.58]  I'll
[1738.58 --> 1738.86]  tease
[1738.86 --> 1739.02]  our
[1739.02 --> 1739.34]  upcoming
[1739.34 --> 1739.90]  Hackintosh
[1739.90 --> 1740.22]  video
[1740.22 --> 1740.84]  it's
[1740.84 --> 1741.50]  scripted
[1741.50 --> 1741.88]  and
[1741.88 --> 1742.42]  shot
[1742.42 --> 1742.92]  and
[1742.92 --> 1743.20]  sitting
[1743.20 --> 1743.36]  in
[1743.36 --> 1743.66]  editing
[1743.66 --> 1743.96]  now
[1743.96 --> 1744.16]  so
[1744.16 --> 1744.34]  you
[1744.34 --> 1744.54]  should
[1744.54 --> 1744.74]  be
[1744.74 --> 1745.10]  expecting
[1745.10 --> 1745.44]  to see
[1745.44 --> 1745.62]  that
[1745.62 --> 1745.96]  sometime
[1745.96 --> 1746.54]  about
[1746.54 --> 1746.90]  mid
[1746.90 --> 1747.26]  next
[1747.26 --> 1747.64]  week
[1747.64 --> 1748.36]  editing
[1748.36 --> 1748.74]  takes
[1748.74 --> 1749.36]  so long
[1749.36 --> 1749.62]  these
[1749.62 --> 1749.96]  days
[1749.96 --> 1750.52]  it's
[1750.52 --> 1751.10]  great
[1751.10 --> 1751.32]  that
[1751.32 --> 1751.48]  we're
[1751.48 --> 1751.70]  able
[1751.70 --> 1752.00]  to
[1752.00 --> 1753.22]  deliver
[1753.22 --> 1753.50]  so
[1753.50 --> 1753.76]  much
[1753.76 --> 1754.00]  better
[1754.00 --> 1754.42]  production
[1754.42 --> 1754.84]  values
[1754.84 --> 1755.02]  than
[1755.02 --> 1755.14]  we
[1755.14 --> 1755.36]  used
[1755.36 --> 1755.52]  to
[1755.52 --> 1755.88]  but
[1755.88 --> 1756.50]  it
[1756.50 --> 1756.68]  is
[1756.68 --> 1757.00]  so
[1757.00 --> 1757.70]  expensive
[1757.70 --> 1758.00]  you
[1758.00 --> 1758.26]  guys
[1758.26 --> 1758.40]  and
[1758.40 --> 1758.52]  it
[1758.52 --> 1758.66]  is
[1758.66 --> 1758.90]  so
[1758.90 --> 1759.36]  time
[1759.36 --> 1759.84]  consuming
[1759.84 --> 1760.44]  to
[1760.44 --> 1760.64]  make
[1760.64 --> 1761.10]  videos
[1761.10 --> 1761.48]  like
[1761.48 --> 1761.78]  the
[1761.78 --> 1763.20]  HTC1
[1763.20 --> 1763.64]  M8
[1763.64 --> 1763.96]  video
[1763.96 --> 1764.16]  that
[1764.16 --> 1764.28]  we
[1764.28 --> 1764.60]  released
[1764.60 --> 1764.94]  last
[1764.94 --> 1765.26]  night
[1765.26 --> 1765.86]  where
[1765.86 --> 1766.24]  that's
[1766.24 --> 1766.54]  like
[1766.54 --> 1767.02]  I
[1767.02 --> 1767.26]  was
[1767.26 --> 1767.86]  talking
[1767.86 --> 1768.02]  to
[1768.02 --> 1768.30]  Jack
[1768.30 --> 1768.60]  from
[1768.60 --> 1769.38]  NCIX
[1769.38 --> 1769.88]  today
[1769.88 --> 1770.80]  and
[1770.80 --> 1770.98]  he
[1770.98 --> 1771.16]  was
[1771.16 --> 1771.46]  saying
[1771.46 --> 1771.96]  that
[1771.96 --> 1773.46]  you
[1773.46 --> 1773.70]  know
[1773.70 --> 1773.98]  blah
[1773.98 --> 1774.10]  blah
[1774.10 --> 1774.38]  blah
[1774.38 --> 1775.02]  video
[1775.02 --> 1775.40]  production
[1775.40 --> 1775.66]  this
[1775.66 --> 1775.88]  video
[1775.88 --> 1776.30]  production
[1776.30 --> 1776.74]  that
[1776.74 --> 1777.48]  we
[1777.48 --> 1777.58]  were
[1777.58 --> 1777.72]  just
[1777.72 --> 1777.86]  kind
[1777.86 --> 1777.94]  of
[1777.94 --> 1778.22]  talking
[1778.22 --> 1778.50]  about
[1778.50 --> 1778.70]  it
[1778.70 --> 1779.02]  and
[1779.02 --> 1779.14]  I
[1779.14 --> 1779.40]  was
[1779.40 --> 1780.46]  telling
[1780.46 --> 1780.78]  him
[1780.78 --> 1781.48]  why
[1781.48 --> 1781.86]  I'm
[1781.86 --> 1782.10]  not
[1782.10 --> 1782.46]  planning
[1782.46 --> 1782.66]  to
[1782.66 --> 1782.80]  do
[1782.80 --> 1782.92]  a
[1782.92 --> 1783.28]  Galaxy
[1783.28 --> 1784.22]  S5
[1784.22 --> 1784.90]  review
[1784.90 --> 1786.10]  Samsung
[1786.10 --> 1786.66]  reached out
[1786.66 --> 1786.86]  to me
[1786.86 --> 1787.24]  they said
[1787.24 --> 1787.72]  they have
[1787.72 --> 1788.24]  a loaner
[1788.24 --> 1788.46]  unit
[1788.46 --> 1788.76]  that I
[1788.76 --> 1788.92]  can
[1788.92 --> 1789.18]  borrow
[1789.18 --> 1789.70]  for
[1789.70 --> 1790.40]  I
[1790.40 --> 1790.66]  think
[1790.66 --> 1791.42]  13
[1791.42 --> 1792.12]  days
[1792.12 --> 1792.28]  or
[1792.28 --> 1792.68]  15
[1792.68 --> 1793.02]  days
[1793.02 --> 1793.14]  or
[1793.14 --> 1793.36]  something
[1793.36 --> 1793.64]  like
[1793.64 --> 1793.96]  that
[1793.96 --> 1794.36]  and
[1794.36 --> 1794.52]  then
[1794.52 --> 1794.64]  it
[1794.64 --> 1794.88]  needs
[1794.88 --> 1795.06]  to
[1795.06 --> 1795.26]  by
[1795.26 --> 1795.86]  that
[1795.86 --> 1796.22]  time
[1796.22 --> 1796.56]  be
[1796.56 --> 1796.86]  in
[1796.86 --> 1797.02]  the
[1797.02 --> 1797.34]  hands
[1797.34 --> 1797.46]  of
[1797.46 --> 1797.56]  the
[1797.56 --> 1797.80]  next
[1797.80 --> 1798.32]  reviewer
[1798.32 --> 1798.80]  and
[1798.80 --> 1798.92]  I
[1798.92 --> 1799.32]  basically
[1799.32 --> 1799.64]  went
[1799.64 --> 1799.84]  you
[1799.84 --> 1799.90]  know
[1799.90 --> 1800.02]  what
[1800.02 --> 1800.12]  I'm
[1800.12 --> 1800.26]  not
[1800.26 --> 1800.36]  going
[1800.36 --> 1800.44]  to
[1800.44 --> 1800.60]  bother
[1800.60 --> 1801.42]  they
[1801.42 --> 1801.62]  can
[1801.62 --> 1801.82]  send
[1801.82 --> 1801.92]  it
[1801.92 --> 1802.02]  to
[1802.02 --> 1802.24]  me
[1802.24 --> 1802.62]  and
[1802.62 --> 1802.78]  I'll
[1802.78 --> 1803.06]  try
[1803.06 --> 1803.34]  it
[1803.34 --> 1803.88]  but
[1803.88 --> 1804.10]  if
[1804.10 --> 1804.28]  it's
[1804.28 --> 1804.50]  not
[1804.50 --> 1804.62]  a
[1804.62 --> 1804.84]  unit
[1804.84 --> 1805.04]  that
[1805.04 --> 1805.16]  I
[1805.16 --> 1805.32]  can
[1805.32 --> 1805.80]  actually
[1805.80 --> 1806.58]  set
[1806.58 --> 1807.02]  up
[1807.02 --> 1807.40]  as
[1807.40 --> 1807.64]  if
[1807.64 --> 1808.02]  I'm
[1808.02 --> 1808.38]  going
[1808.38 --> 1808.64]  to
[1808.64 --> 1808.94]  use
[1808.94 --> 1809.20]  this
[1809.20 --> 1809.38]  as
[1809.38 --> 1809.56]  my
[1809.56 --> 1809.82]  daily
[1809.82 --> 1810.10]  driver
[1810.10 --> 1810.28]  for
[1810.28 --> 1810.38]  the
[1810.38 --> 1810.54]  next
[1810.54 --> 1810.74]  six
[1810.74 --> 1811.06]  months
[1811.06 --> 1811.58]  then
[1811.58 --> 1811.70]  I
[1811.70 --> 1811.92]  just
[1811.92 --> 1812.22]  don't
[1812.22 --> 1812.44]  feel
[1812.44 --> 1812.64]  that
[1812.64 --> 1813.36]  incentivized
[1813.36 --> 1813.54]  to
[1813.54 --> 1813.76]  bother
[1813.76 --> 1814.04]  with
[1814.04 --> 1814.20]  it
[1814.20 --> 1814.46]  and
[1814.46 --> 1814.82]  frankly
[1814.82 --> 1815.00]  I
[1815.00 --> 1815.18]  find
[1815.18 --> 1815.28]  it
[1815.28 --> 1815.42]  kind
[1815.42 --> 1815.50]  of
[1815.50 --> 1815.88]  insulting
[1815.88 --> 1816.36]  because
[1816.36 --> 1816.96]  doing
[1816.96 --> 1817.16]  a
[1817.16 --> 1817.58]  review
[1817.58 --> 1818.06]  like
[1818.06 --> 1818.22]  the
[1818.22 --> 1818.50]  M8
[1818.50 --> 1818.88]  review
[1818.88 --> 1820.62]  is
[1820.62 --> 1822.30]  a bit
[1822.30 --> 1822.50]  of a
[1822.50 --> 1822.72]  different
[1822.72 --> 1823.06]  approach
[1823.06 --> 1823.22]  for
[1823.22 --> 1823.48]  us
[1823.48 --> 1824.16]  I
[1824.16 --> 1824.48]  try
[1824.48 --> 1824.74]  to
[1824.74 --> 1825.12]  use
[1825.12 --> 1825.28]  the
[1825.28 --> 1825.74]  devices
[1825.74 --> 1826.52]  as
[1826.52 --> 1826.94]  if
[1826.94 --> 1827.28]  I'm
[1827.28 --> 1827.56]  planning
[1827.56 --> 1827.78]  to
[1827.78 --> 1827.96]  use
[1827.96 --> 1828.08]  it
[1828.08 --> 1828.38]  forever
[1828.38 --> 1828.64]  I
[1828.64 --> 1829.00]  try
[1829.00 --> 1829.28]  to
[1829.28 --> 1829.82]  switch
[1829.82 --> 1830.42]  to
[1830.42 --> 1830.72]  every
[1830.72 --> 1831.14]  device
[1831.14 --> 1831.34]  that
[1831.34 --> 1831.52]  I
[1831.52 --> 1832.18]  use
[1832.18 --> 1832.48]  because
[1832.48 --> 1832.66]  I
[1832.66 --> 1832.86]  think
[1832.86 --> 1833.00]  that
[1833.00 --> 1833.20]  that's
[1833.20 --> 1833.32]  the
[1833.32 --> 1833.46]  only
[1833.46 --> 1833.64]  way
[1833.64 --> 1833.76]  to
[1833.76 --> 1834.00]  review
[1834.00 --> 1834.16]  it
[1834.16 --> 1834.58]  properly
[1834.58 --> 1835.18]  that's
[1835.18 --> 1835.28]  the
[1835.28 --> 1835.44]  only
[1835.44 --> 1835.68]  way
[1835.68 --> 1835.86]  that
[1835.86 --> 1835.96]  you
[1835.96 --> 1836.14]  can
[1836.14 --> 1836.76]  incentivize
[1836.76 --> 1837.24]  yourself
[1837.24 --> 1837.84]  to
[1837.84 --> 1838.36]  work
[1838.36 --> 1838.54]  through
[1838.54 --> 1838.72]  the
[1838.72 --> 1839.14]  problems
[1839.14 --> 1839.66]  and
[1839.66 --> 1839.88]  that's
[1839.88 --> 1840.00]  the
[1840.00 --> 1840.16]  only
[1840.16 --> 1840.54]  way
[1840.54 --> 1840.82]  that
[1840.82 --> 1840.96]  you
[1840.96 --> 1841.12]  can
[1841.12 --> 1841.56]  avoid
[1841.56 --> 1842.10]  convincing
[1842.10 --> 1842.66]  yourself
[1842.66 --> 1843.42]  that
[1843.42 --> 1843.94]  this
[1843.94 --> 1844.32]  lock
[1844.32 --> 1844.70]  button
[1844.70 --> 1845.10]  isn't
[1845.10 --> 1845.34]  going to
[1845.34 --> 1845.56]  bother
[1845.56 --> 1845.74]  me
[1845.74 --> 1845.96]  in the
[1845.96 --> 1846.18]  long
[1846.18 --> 1846.40]  term
[1846.40 --> 1846.52]  you
[1846.52 --> 1846.70]  have
[1846.70 --> 1846.82]  to
[1846.82 --> 1847.22]  actually
[1847.22 --> 1847.54]  think
[1847.54 --> 1847.76]  about
[1847.76 --> 1847.86]  it
[1847.86 --> 1847.98]  if
[1847.98 --> 1848.12]  I'm
[1848.12 --> 1848.22]  going
[1848.22 --> 1848.26]  to
[1848.26 --> 1848.38]  be
[1848.38 --> 1848.58]  using
[1848.58 --> 1848.74]  this
[1848.74 --> 1848.86]  for
[1848.86 --> 1849.04]  six
[1849.04 --> 1849.32]  months
[1849.32 --> 1849.64]  then
[1849.64 --> 1850.22]  will
[1850.22 --> 1850.34]  it
[1850.34 --> 1850.44]  be
[1850.44 --> 1850.62]  good
[1850.62 --> 1850.82]  enough
[1850.82 --> 1850.98]  for
[1850.98 --> 1851.16]  me
[1851.16 --> 1851.82]  and
[1851.82 --> 1852.10]  you
[1852.10 --> 1852.28]  could
[1852.28 --> 1852.48]  kind
[1852.48 --> 1852.56]  of
[1852.56 --> 1852.70]  sit
[1852.70 --> 1852.86]  there
[1852.86 --> 1852.98]  and
[1852.98 --> 1853.12]  go
[1853.12 --> 1853.30]  oh
[1853.30 --> 1853.46]  well
[1853.46 --> 1853.76]  Linus
[1853.76 --> 1853.90]  you
[1853.90 --> 1854.10]  just
[1854.10 --> 1854.48]  want
[1854.48 --> 1854.64]  you
[1854.64 --> 1854.82]  just
[1854.82 --> 1855.08]  want
[1855.08 --> 1855.30]  free
[1855.30 --> 1855.76]  phones
[1855.76 --> 1856.52]  and
[1856.52 --> 1857.00]  it's
[1857.00 --> 1857.32]  not
[1857.32 --> 1858.48]  that
[1858.48 --> 1859.38]  because
[1859.38 --> 1860.16]  for the
[1860.16 --> 1860.84]  cost
[1860.84 --> 1861.70]  of me
[1861.70 --> 1862.10]  making
[1862.10 --> 1862.60]  this
[1862.60 --> 1862.92]  video
[1862.92 --> 1863.06]  I
[1863.06 --> 1863.18]  was
[1863.18 --> 1863.42]  telling
[1863.42 --> 1863.70]  Jack
[1863.70 --> 1863.98]  this
[1863.98 --> 1864.44]  it
[1864.44 --> 1864.80]  cost
[1864.80 --> 1865.04]  me
[1865.04 --> 1865.52]  about
[1865.52 --> 1866.24]  20
[1866.24 --> 1866.56]  labor
[1866.56 --> 1867.02]  hours
[1867.02 --> 1867.44]  which
[1875.74 --> 1876.30]  well
[1876.30 --> 1876.68]  over
[1876.68 --> 1877.26]  $500
[1877.26 --> 1877.84]  to
[1877.84 --> 1878.10]  make
[1878.10 --> 1878.48]  that
[1878.48 --> 1878.92]  video
[1878.92 --> 1879.72]  I
[1879.72 --> 1879.94]  could
[1879.94 --> 1880.26]  literally
[1880.26 --> 1880.64]  just
[1880.64 --> 1881.14]  not
[1881.14 --> 1881.36]  make
[1881.36 --> 1881.48]  a
[1881.48 --> 1881.76]  video
[1881.76 --> 1882.14]  and
[1882.14 --> 1882.26]  I
[1882.26 --> 1882.38]  could
[1882.38 --> 1882.52]  go
[1882.52 --> 1882.90]  buy
[1882.90 --> 1883.06]  an
[1883.06 --> 1883.52]  S5
[1883.52 --> 1884.20]  and
[1884.20 --> 1884.36]  that
[1884.36 --> 1884.52]  would
[1884.52 --> 1884.74]  work
[1884.74 --> 1884.86]  out
[1884.86 --> 1885.10]  just
[1885.10 --> 1885.32]  fine
[1885.32 --> 1885.46]  for
[1885.46 --> 1885.56]  me
[1885.56 --> 1885.86]  because
[1885.86 --> 1886.20]  that
[1886.20 --> 1886.76]  $500
[1886.76 --> 1887.58]  doesn't
[1887.58 --> 1887.76]  even
[1887.76 --> 1888.10]  factor
[1888.10 --> 1888.26]  in
[1888.26 --> 1888.38]  the
[1888.38 --> 1888.58]  time
[1888.58 --> 1888.74]  that
[1888.74 --> 1889.02]  I
[1889.02 --> 1889.38]  spent
[1889.38 --> 1889.94]  using
[1889.94 --> 1890.12]  the
[1890.12 --> 1890.54]  device
[1890.54 --> 1890.96]  and
[1890.96 --> 1891.32]  tinkering
[1891.32 --> 1891.60]  with
[1891.60 --> 1891.78]  it
[1891.78 --> 1892.14]  and
[1892.14 --> 1892.72]  compiling
[1892.72 --> 1893.12]  my
[1893.12 --> 1893.48]  notes
[1893.48 --> 1893.94]  and
[1893.94 --> 1894.34]  scripting
[1894.34 --> 1894.50]  my
[1894.50 --> 1894.82]  review
[1894.82 --> 1895.50]  all
[1895.50 --> 1895.78]  right
[1895.78 --> 1896.54]  so
[1896.54 --> 1897.22]  I
[1897.22 --> 1897.60]  basically
[1897.60 --> 1897.82]  went
[1897.82 --> 1898.04]  okay
[1898.04 --> 1898.20]  yeah
[1898.20 --> 1898.36]  you
[1898.36 --> 1898.52]  guys
[1898.52 --> 1898.68]  can
[1898.68 --> 1898.84]  send
[1898.84 --> 1898.96]  one
[1898.96 --> 1899.04]  to
[1899.04 --> 1899.12]  me
[1899.12 --> 1899.24]  but
[1899.24 --> 1899.30]  I
[1899.30 --> 1899.48]  not
[1899.48 --> 1899.60]  going
[1899.60 --> 1899.64]  to
[1899.64 --> 1899.78]  make
[1899.78 --> 1899.90]  a
[1899.90 --> 1900.20]  review
[1900.20 --> 1900.84]  because
[1900.84 --> 1901.52]  if
[1901.52 --> 1901.72]  I'm
[1901.72 --> 1901.98]  not
[1901.98 --> 1902.60]  worth
[1902.60 --> 1902.84]  the
[1902.84 --> 1903.14]  effort
[1903.14 --> 1903.34]  or
[1903.34 --> 1903.68]  worth
[1903.68 --> 1903.92]  the
[1903.92 --> 1904.40]  resources
[1904.40 --> 1904.70]  to
[1904.70 --> 1904.88]  send
[1904.88 --> 1905.00]  a
[1905.00 --> 1905.24]  phone
[1905.24 --> 1905.86]  then
[1905.86 --> 1906.10]  quite
[1906.10 --> 1906.44]  frankly
[1906.44 --> 1906.68]  you're
[1906.68 --> 1906.84]  not
[1906.84 --> 1907.06]  worth
[1907.06 --> 1907.22]  me
[1907.22 --> 1907.50]  spending
[1907.50 --> 1907.96]  $500
[1907.96 --> 1908.34]  to
[1908.34 --> 1908.48]  make
[1908.48 --> 1908.58]  a
[1908.58 --> 1908.78]  video
[1908.78 --> 1909.06]  about
[1909.06 --> 1909.20]  it
[1909.20 --> 1909.38]  and
[1909.38 --> 1909.58]  it's
[1909.58 --> 1909.78]  just
[1909.78 --> 1910.06]  kind
[1910.06 --> 1910.26]  of
[1910.26 --> 1910.96]  leave
[1910.96 --> 1911.06]  it
[1911.06 --> 1911.20]  at
[1911.20 --> 1911.52]  that
[1911.52 --> 1912.90]  so
[1912.90 --> 1913.78]  I
[1913.78 --> 1914.48]  don't
[1914.48 --> 1914.60]  even
[1914.60 --> 1914.94]  remember
[1914.94 --> 1915.22]  where
[1915.22 --> 1915.34]  I
[1915.34 --> 1915.50]  was
[1915.50 --> 1915.78]  going
[1915.78 --> 1916.00]  with
[1916.00 --> 1916.38]  this

[1917.98 --> 1918.20]  how
[1918.20 --> 1918.36]  did
[1918.36 --> 1918.48]  I
[1918.48 --> 1918.64]  end
[1918.64 --> 1918.78]  up
[1918.78 --> 1919.06]  talking

[1928.96 --> 1929.32]  this
[1929.32 --> 1929.48]  is
[1929.48 --> 1929.92]  really
[1929.92 --> 1930.28]  cool
[1930.28 --> 1930.60]  so
[1930.60 --> 1930.74]  the
[1930.74 --> 1931.06]  BBC
[1931.06 --> 1931.62]  has
[1931.62 --> 1932.10]  this
[1932.10 --> 1932.50]  article
[1932.50 --> 1932.96]  talking
[1932.96 --> 1933.54]  about
[1933.54 --> 1934.08]  a
[1934.08 --> 1934.68]  battery
[1934.68 --> 1935.34]  that
[1935.34 --> 1935.64]  right
[1935.64 --> 1936.12]  now
[1936.12 --> 1936.58]  is
[1936.58 --> 1937.06]  not
[1937.06 --> 1937.78]  miniaturized
[1937.78 --> 1938.06]  enough
[1938.06 --> 1938.24]  for

[1938.74 --> 1939.08]  use

[1947.08 --> 1947.72]  seconds
[1947.72 --> 1948.34]  so
[1948.34 --> 1948.54]  they
[1948.54 --> 1949.06]  charged
[1949.06 --> 1949.38]  up

[1962.08 --> 1962.68]  is
[1962.68 --> 1962.88]  that
[1962.88 --> 1963.08]  we're
[1963.08 --> 1963.58]  actually
[1963.58 --> 1964.06]  not
[1964.06 --> 1964.36]  that
[1964.36 --> 1964.78]  far
[1964.78 --> 1965.24]  away
[1965.24 --> 1965.74]  from
[1965.74 --> 1965.88]  it
[1965.88 --> 1966.20]  being
[1966.20 --> 1966.50]  a
[1966.50 --> 1966.80]  product
[1966.80 --> 1966.98]  that
[1966.98 --> 1967.08]  can
[1967.08 --> 1967.22]  be
[1967.22 --> 1967.78]  commercialized
[1967.78 --> 1968.02]  so
[1968.02 --> 1968.62]  this
[1968.62 --> 1969.90]  bio-organic
[1969.90 --> 1970.34]  battery
[1970.34 --> 1970.86]  uses
[1970.86 --> 1972.98]  tiny
[1972.98 --> 1973.64]  self-assembling
[1973.64 --> 1974.50]  nanocrystals
[1974.50 --> 1974.86]  that were
[1974.86 --> 1975.58]  first identified
[1975.58 --> 1976.22]  in research
[1976.22 --> 1976.72]  that was
[1976.72 --> 1977.46]  actually being
[1977.46 --> 1977.62]  done
[1977.62 --> 1977.84]  into

[1980.46 --> 1980.74]  years
[1980.74 --> 1981.06]  ago
[1981.06 --> 1981.70]  and
[1981.70 --> 1981.86]  the
[1981.86 --> 1982.14]  team
[1982.14 --> 1982.36]  is
[1982.36 --> 1982.76]  using
[1982.76 --> 1983.02]  these
[1983.02 --> 1983.90]  nanocrystals
[1983.90 --> 1984.34]  in
[1984.34 --> 1984.60]  order
[1984.60 --> 1984.86]  to
[1984.86 --> 1985.18]  create

[1987.32 --> 1987.80]  devices
[1987.80 --> 1988.42]  such as

[1990.66 --> 1991.06]  storage
[1991.06 --> 1991.38]  chips
[1991.38 --> 1991.82]  so
[1991.82 --> 1991.98]  they're
[1991.98 --> 1992.20]  even
[1992.20 --> 1992.50]  showing
[1992.50 --> 1992.76]  off
[1992.76 --> 1993.10]  these
[1993.10 --> 1994.58]  organic

[1995.68 --> 1995.92]  or
[1995.92 --> 1996.16]  whatever
[1996.16 --> 1996.38]  you
[1996.38 --> 1996.56]  want
[1996.56 --> 1996.68]  to

[2000.78 --> 2001.22]  applications
[2001.22 --> 2001.54]  and they're
[2001.54 --> 2001.96]  showing off
[2001.96 --> 2002.34]  that they can
[2002.34 --> 2002.84]  achieve write
[2002.84 --> 2003.12]  speeds
[2003.12 --> 2003.50]  up to
[2003.50 --> 2003.88]  three
[2003.88 --> 2004.32]  times
[2004.32 --> 2004.64]  what we
[2004.64 --> 2004.92]  can do
[2004.92 --> 2005.10]  with
[2005.10 --> 2005.40]  current

[2006.16 --> 2006.72]  the

[2007.30 --> 2007.66]  so
[2007.66 --> 2007.94]  back to
[2007.94 --> 2008.02]  the
[2008.02 --> 2008.30]  batteries
[2008.30 --> 2008.48]  are
[2008.48 --> 2008.76]  likely
[2008.76 --> 2008.88]  to
[2008.88 --> 2008.96]  be

[2009.60 --> 2009.90]  percent
[2009.90 --> 2010.12]  more

[2011.98 --> 2012.20]  final
[2012.20 --> 2012.62]  product
[2012.62 --> 2012.78]  will
[2012.78 --> 2013.04]  likely
[2013.04 --> 2013.20]  be
[2013.20 --> 2013.44]  about
[2017.80 --> 2017.96]  what
[2017.96 --> 2018.00]  would
[2018.00 --> 2018.22]  you
[2018.22 --> 2018.60]  guys
[2018.60 --> 2019.06]  give
[2019.06 --> 2020.30]  would
[2020.30 --> 2020.44]  you
[2020.44 --> 2020.82]  pay
[2020.82 --> 2021.38]  like
[2021.38 --> 2021.62]  I
[2021.62 --> 2021.98]  mean
[2021.98 --> 2022.20]  okay
[2022.20 --> 2022.50]  let's
[2022.50 --> 2022.76]  say
[2022.76 --> 2023.20]  just
[2023.20 --> 2023.74]  for a
[2023.74 --> 2024.02]  second
[2024.02 --> 2024.32]  I
[2024.32 --> 2024.48]  just
[2024.48 --> 2024.66]  bought
[2024.66 --> 2024.76]  a
[2024.76 --> 2025.06]  replacement
[2025.06 --> 2025.46]  battery
[2025.46 --> 2025.72]  for
[2025.72 --> 2025.84]  a
[2025.84 --> 2026.06]  droid
[2026.06 --> 2026.32]  DNA
[2026.32 --> 2026.62]  and I
[2026.62 --> 2026.78]  think
[2026.78 --> 2026.90]  it
[2026.90 --> 2027.10]  cost
[2027.10 --> 2027.22]  me
[2027.22 --> 2027.36]  about
[2027.36 --> 2027.64]  50
[2027.64 --> 2027.90]  bucks
[2027.90 --> 2028.42]  so
[2028.42 --> 2028.72]  let's
[2028.72 --> 2028.92]  say
[2028.92 --> 2029.20]  it
[2029.20 --> 2029.62]  added
[2029.62 --> 2029.90]  a
[2029.90 --> 2030.20]  hundred
[2030.20 --> 2030.68]  dollars
[2030.68 --> 2031.16]  to
[2031.16 --> 2031.30]  the
[2031.30 --> 2031.58]  price
[2031.58 --> 2031.70]  of
[2031.70 --> 2031.82]  a

[2032.06 --> 2032.34]  line
[2032.34 --> 2032.86]  smartphone
[2032.86 --> 2033.14]  or
[2033.14 --> 2033.34]  even
[2033.34 --> 2033.46]  a
[2033.46 --> 2033.64]  hundred
[2033.70 --> 2033.86]  and
[2033.86 --> 2034.08]  fifty
[2034.08 --> 2034.92]  would
[2034.92 --> 2035.06]  you
[2035.06 --> 2035.32]  pay
[2035.32 --> 2035.50]  the
[2035.50 --> 2035.72]  extra
[2035.72 --> 2035.98]  hundred
[2035.98 --> 2036.10]  and
[2036.10 --> 2036.30]  fifty
[2036.30 --> 2036.72]  dollars
[2036.72 --> 2037.38]  for
[2037.38 --> 2037.60]  a
[2037.60 --> 2037.92]  phone
[2037.92 --> 2038.62]  and
[2038.62 --> 2038.78]  I'd
[2038.78 --> 2038.90]  love
[2047.80 --> 2048.40]  charging
[2048.40 --> 2049.04]  that
[2049.04 --> 2049.20]  you
[2049.20 --> 2049.36]  could
[2049.36 --> 2049.92]  basically
[2049.92 --> 2050.50]  put
[2050.50 --> 2050.62]  up
[2050.62 --> 2050.88]  against
[2050.88 --> 2051.04]  the
[2051.04 --> 2051.36]  pad
[2051.36 --> 2051.76]  for
[2051.76 --> 2052.08]  thirty
[2052.08 --> 2052.58]  seconds
[2052.58 --> 2053.10]  and
[2053.10 --> 2053.54]  fully
[2053.54 --> 2053.98]  recharge
[2053.98 --> 2054.24]  it
[2054.24 --> 2056.10]  wow
[2056.10 --> 2057.32]  let's
[2057.32 --> 2057.48]  say
[2057.48 --> 2057.80]  for a
[2057.80 --> 2058.00]  second
[2058.00 --> 2058.24]  that
[2058.24 --> 2058.42]  the
[2058.42 --> 2058.98]  pads
[2058.98 --> 2059.44]  also
[2059.44 --> 2059.84]  cost
[2059.84 --> 2060.12]  twice
[2060.12 --> 2060.32]  as
[2060.32 --> 2060.56]  much
[2060.56 --> 2060.94]  so
[2060.94 --> 2061.10]  right
[2061.10 --> 2061.28]  now
[2061.28 --> 2061.46]  you
[2061.46 --> 2061.62]  can
[2061.62 --> 2061.78]  get
[2061.78 --> 2061.90]  a
[2061.90 --> 2062.08]  chi
[2062.08 --> 2062.42]  pad
[2062.42 --> 2062.60]  for
[2062.60 --> 2062.88]  about
[2062.88 --> 2063.26]  twenty
[2063.26 --> 2063.54]  bucks
[2063.54 --> 2063.72]  so
[2063.72 --> 2066.00]  you're
[2066.00 --> 2066.36]  spending
[2066.36 --> 2066.84]  almost
[2066.84 --> 2067.10]  two
[2067.10 --> 2067.42]  hundred
[2067.42 --> 2067.80]  dollars
[2067.80 --> 2068.20]  extra
[2068.20 --> 2068.88]  out
[2068.88 --> 2069.04]  of
[2069.04 --> 2069.44]  pocket
[2069.44 --> 2069.72]  to
[2069.72 --> 2069.90]  have
[2069.90 --> 2070.12]  that
[2070.12 --> 2070.48]  solution
[2070.48 --> 2070.78]  I'd
[2070.78 --> 2071.02]  love
[2071.02 --> 2071.16]  to
[2071.16 --> 2071.40]  hear
[2071.40 --> 2071.84]  if
[2071.84 --> 2071.94]  you
[2071.94 --> 2072.32]  think
[2072.32 --> 2072.56]  that's
[2072.56 --> 2072.74]  worth
[2072.74 --> 2072.86]  it
[2072.86 --> 2073.12]  because
[2073.12 --> 2073.50]  I
[2073.50 --> 2074.44]  totally
[2074.44 --> 2075.22]  do
[2075.22 --> 2075.70]  I
[2075.70 --> 2075.84]  am
[2075.84 --> 2076.34]  tired
[2076.34 --> 2076.94]  of
[2076.94 --> 2077.44]  batteries
[2077.44 --> 2078.02]  just
[2078.02 --> 2078.46]  running
[2078.46 --> 2078.68]  out
[2078.68 --> 2078.90]  of
[2078.90 --> 2079.66]  life
[2079.66 --> 2079.92]  and
[2079.92 --> 2080.32]  being
[2080.32 --> 2080.82]  frustrating
[2080.82 --> 2081.64]  all right
[2081.64 --> 2083.12]  now I
[2083.12 --> 2083.30]  have
[2083.30 --> 2083.70]  received
[2083.70 --> 2084.50]  a ton
[2084.50 --> 2084.88]  of

[2086.32 --> 2086.86]  this
[2086.86 --> 2087.16]  bad
[2087.16 --> 2087.32]  boy
[2087.32 --> 2087.66]  this

[2093.90 --> 2094.28]  available
[2094.28 --> 2094.96]  at
[2094.96 --> 2095.20]  a

[2100.36 --> 2100.56]  it
[2100.56 --> 2100.94]  has

[2110.98 --> 2111.24]  actually
[2111.24 --> 2111.50]  really
[2111.50 --> 2111.76]  cool
[2111.76 --> 2111.92]  so
[2111.92 --> 2112.02]  it
[2112.02 --> 2112.10]  can

[2156.72 --> 2156.86]  and
[2156.86 --> 2157.38]  he's

[2169.90 --> 2170.20]  geek
[2170.20 --> 2170.54]  but
[2170.54 --> 2170.70]  it's
[2170.70 --> 2170.92]  great
[2170.92 --> 2171.18]  because
[2171.18 --> 2171.32]  I
[2171.32 --> 2171.46]  was
[2171.46 --> 2171.62]  able

[2172.20 --> 2172.36]  to
[2172.36 --> 2172.62]  him
[2172.62 --> 2173.00]  and
[2173.00 --> 2173.10]  I
[2173.10 --> 2173.30]  got
[2173.30 --> 2173.46]  his
[2173.46 --> 2173.78]  initial
[2173.78 --> 2174.26]  impressions
[2174.26 --> 2174.80]  already
[2174.80 --> 2175.18]  that
[2175.18 --> 2175.36]  I
[2175.36 --> 2175.50]  will
[2175.50 --> 2175.80]  just
[2175.80 --> 2175.98]  going
[2175.98 --> 2176.34]  tease
[2176.34 --> 2176.48]  you
[2176.48 --> 2176.70]  guys
[2176.70 --> 2176.96]  with
[2176.96 --> 2177.38]  now
[2177.38 --> 2177.98]  where
[2177.98 --> 2178.10]  he
[2178.10 --> 2178.32]  said
[2178.32 --> 2178.44]  it
[2178.44 --> 2178.58]  is
[2178.58 --> 2178.68]  a
[2178.68 --> 2178.78]  little
[2178.78 --> 2178.92]  bit
[2178.92 --> 2179.06]  on
[2179.06 --> 2179.18]  the
[2179.18 --> 2179.34]  heavy
[2179.34 --> 2179.68]  side
[2179.68 --> 2179.86]  but
[2179.86 --> 2180.04]  that
[2180.04 --> 2180.32]  the
[2180.32 --> 2181.04]  tracking
[2181.04 --> 2181.52]  is
[2181.52 --> 2182.28]  actually
[2182.28 --> 2182.88]  very
[2182.88 --> 2183.50]  accurate
[2183.50 --> 2183.72]  so
[2183.72 --> 2183.80]  I
[2183.80 --> 2183.88]  have
[2183.88 --> 2183.98]  his
[2183.98 --> 2184.22]  initial
[2184.22 --> 2184.64]  impressions
[2184.64 --> 2185.22]  and
[2185.22 --> 2185.32]  we
[2185.32 --> 2185.42]  will
[2185.42 --> 2185.54]  be

[2185.82 --> 2185.94]  you
[2185.94 --> 2186.08]  with
[2186.08 --> 2186.32]  that
[2186.32 --> 2186.62]  but
[2186.62 --> 2186.98]  this
[2186.98 --> 2187.18]  worked
[2187.18 --> 2187.34]  out
[2187.34 --> 2187.54]  really
[2187.54 --> 2187.76]  well
[2187.76 --> 2188.22]  because
[2188.22 --> 2189.32]  I
[2189.32 --> 2189.44]  don't
[2189.44 --> 2189.68]  remember
[2189.68 --> 2189.88]  where I
[2189.88 --> 2190.00]  was
[2190.00 --> 2190.20]  going
[2190.20 --> 2190.38]  with
[2190.38 --> 2190.50]  that
[2190.50 --> 2190.68]  this
[2190.68 --> 2190.78]  is
[2190.78 --> 2190.90]  the
[2190.90 --> 2191.18]  problem
[2191.18 --> 2191.34]  with
[2191.34 --> 2191.50]  not
[2191.50 --> 2191.76]  having
[2191.76 --> 2191.96]  him
[2191.96 --> 2192.10]  to
[2192.10 --> 2192.26]  keep
[2192.26 --> 2192.40]  me
[2192.40 --> 2192.70]  grounded
[2192.70 --> 2192.92]  as
[2192.92 --> 2193.00]  I
[2193.00 --> 2193.14]  just
[2193.14 --> 2193.40]  kind
[2193.40 --> 2193.50]  of
[2193.50 --> 2194.44]  go
[2194.44 --> 2195.18]  but
[2195.18 --> 2195.88]  very
[2195.88 --> 2196.22]  very
[2196.22 --> 2197.08]  exciting
[2197.08 --> 2197.36]  and
[2197.36 --> 2197.84]  definitely
[2197.84 --> 2198.30]  a
[2198.30 --> 2198.76]  first
[2198.76 --> 2198.92]  in
[2198.92 --> 2199.04]  the
[2199.04 --> 2199.34]  industry
[2199.34 --> 2199.50]  and
[2199.50 --> 2199.56]  I
[2199.56 --> 2199.68]  mean
[2199.68 --> 2199.94]  it's
[2199.94 --> 2200.54]  Logitech
[2200.54 --> 2201.38]  so
[2201.38 --> 2201.80]  their
[2201.80 --> 2202.14]  software
[2202.14 --> 2202.30]  is
[2202.30 --> 2202.42]  going
[2202.42 --> 2202.48]  to
[2202.48 --> 2202.64]  be
[2202.64 --> 2203.22]  stable
[2203.22 --> 2204.14]  they've
[2204.14 --> 2204.36]  got a
[2204.36 --> 2204.60]  three-year
[2204.60 --> 2205.02]  warranty
[2205.02 --> 2205.64]  that is
[2205.64 --> 2206.30]  legendary
[2206.30 --> 2206.80]  I've
[2206.80 --> 2207.04]  had to
[2207.04 --> 2207.28]  use it
[2207.28 --> 2207.54]  a couple
[2207.54 --> 2207.84]  times
[2207.84 --> 2208.18]  myself
[2208.18 --> 2208.40]  and
[2208.40 --> 2208.58]  it's
[2208.58 --> 2208.74]  been
[2208.74 --> 2208.96]  a
[2208.96 --> 2209.96]  satisfying
[2209.96 --> 2210.70]  experience
[2210.70 --> 2211.04]  every
[2211.04 --> 2211.34]  single
[2211.34 --> 2211.76]  time
[2211.76 --> 2212.58]  and
[2212.58 --> 2213.20]  I
[2213.20 --> 2213.36]  guess
[2213.36 --> 2213.54]  that's
[2213.54 --> 2213.68]  pretty
[2213.68 --> 2213.86]  much
[2213.86 --> 2213.98]  all
[2213.98 --> 2214.04]  I
[2214.04 --> 2214.14]  have

[2214.74 --> 2215.04]  Luke
[2215.04 --> 2215.28]  will
[2215.28 --> 2215.48]  have
[2215.48 --> 2215.62]  a
[2215.62 --> 2215.90]  chance
[2215.90 --> 2216.06]  to

[2263.26 --> 2264.08]  nope
[2264.08 --> 2264.46]  we're
[2264.46 --> 2264.64]  not
[2264.64 --> 2264.76]  going

[2265.14 --> 2265.32]  a
[2265.32 --> 2265.54]  rule
[2265.54 --> 2265.86]  but
[2265.86 --> 2266.14]  what
[2266.14 --> 2266.30]  we
[2266.30 --> 2266.62]  can
[2266.62 --> 2266.92]  do
[2266.92 --> 2267.46]  is
[2267.46 --> 2267.86]  audit
[2267.86 --> 2268.26]  by
[2268.26 --> 2268.84]  IP
[2268.84 --> 2269.76]  and
[2269.76 --> 2269.94]  we
[2269.94 --> 2270.18]  actually
[2270.18 --> 2270.30]  have
[2270.30 --> 2270.40]  a
[2270.40 --> 2270.58]  couple
[2270.58 --> 2270.74]  of
[2270.74 --> 2270.92]  other
[2270.92 --> 2271.26]  fancy
[2271.26 --> 2271.58]  tricks
[2271.58 --> 2271.80]  as
[2271.80 --> 2271.96]  well
[2271.96 --> 2272.14]  so
[2272.14 --> 2272.34]  don't
[2272.34 --> 2272.62]  worry
[2272.62 --> 2273.30]  we'll
[2273.30 --> 2273.46]  know
[2273.46 --> 2273.60]  if
[2273.60 --> 2273.78]  people
[2273.78 --> 2273.92]  have
[2273.92 --> 2274.22]  duplicate
[2274.22 --> 2274.64]  entries
[2274.64 --> 2275.42]  all
[2275.42 --> 2275.64]  right
[2275.64 --> 2277.98]  Marco
[2277.98 --> 2278.38]  says
[2278.38 --> 2278.92]  yes
[2278.92 --> 2279.90]  definitely
[2279.90 --> 2280.54]  worthwhile
[2280.54 --> 2281.20]  on that
[2281.20 --> 2281.40]  new
[2281.40 --> 2281.72]  battery
[2281.72 --> 2282.22]  idea
[2282.22 --> 2283.52]  Tyler
[2283.52 --> 2284.06]  says
[2284.06 --> 2284.82]  not
[2284.82 --> 2285.18]  in the
[2285.18 --> 2285.48]  first
[2285.48 --> 2285.86]  gen
[2285.86 --> 2286.88]  wouldn't

[2287.06 --> 2287.72]  $150
[2287.72 --> 2288.52]  for it
[2288.52 --> 2288.64]  so
[2288.64 --> 2288.88]  maybe
[2288.88 --> 2289.22]  second
[2289.22 --> 2289.42]  or
[2289.42 --> 2289.68]  third
[2289.68 --> 2289.96]  gen
[2289.96 --> 2290.16]  they
[2290.16 --> 2290.32]  can
[2290.32 --> 2290.46]  have
[2290.46 --> 2290.58]  my
[2290.58 --> 2290.88]  money
[2290.88 --> 2291.70]  Casey
[2291.70 --> 2292.12]  says
[2292.12 --> 2292.52]  yes
[2292.52 --> 2293.16]  even
[2293.16 --> 2293.34]  if
[2293.34 --> 2293.46]  it
[2293.46 --> 2293.64]  was
[2293.64 --> 2293.94]  thicker
[2293.94 --> 2294.26]  and
[2294.26 --> 2294.60]  produced
[2294.60 --> 2294.82]  more
[2294.82 --> 2295.14]  heat
[2295.14 --> 2295.72]  all
[2295.72 --> 2295.98]  the
[2295.98 --> 2296.38]  yes
[2296.38 --> 2297.18]  John
[2297.18 --> 2297.60]  says
[2297.60 --> 2298.02]  hell
[2298.02 --> 2298.36]  yeah
[2298.36 --> 2298.70]  that's
[2298.70 --> 2298.84]  a
[2298.84 --> 2299.12]  bargain
[2299.12 --> 2299.44]  in my
[2299.44 --> 2299.76]  opinion
[2299.76 --> 2300.00]  I
[2300.00 --> 2300.20]  would
[2300.20 --> 2300.72]  love
[2300.72 --> 2301.14]  to
[2301.14 --> 2301.40]  charge
[2301.40 --> 2301.52]  a
[2301.52 --> 2301.68]  note
[2301.68 --> 2301.94]  three
[2301.94 --> 2302.14]  in
[2302.14 --> 2302.54]  26
[2302.54 --> 2303.08]  seconds
[2303.08 --> 2303.84]  Anthony
[2303.84 --> 2304.22]  says
[2304.22 --> 2304.54]  hell
[2304.54 --> 2305.08]  yeah
[2305.08 --> 2305.78]  hell
[2305.78 --> 2307.12]  yes
[2307.12 --> 2307.84]  hell
[2307.84 --> 2308.36]  yeah
[2308.36 --> 2309.16]  yes
[2309.16 --> 2309.52]  I
[2309.52 --> 2309.72]  would
[2309.72 --> 2309.90]  pay
[2309.90 --> 2310.08]  that
[2310.08 --> 2310.20]  is
[2310.20 --> 2310.28]  a
[2310.28 --> 2310.44]  bad
[2310.44 --> 2310.60]  word
[2310.60 --> 2310.82]  Danny
[2310.82 --> 2311.56]  Luke
[2311.56 --> 2311.86]  says
[2311.86 --> 2311.98]  I
[2311.98 --> 2312.12]  would
[2312.12 --> 2312.54]  totally
[2312.54 --> 2312.86]  pay
[2312.86 --> 2313.30]  $200
[2313.30 --> 2314.22]  for a
[2314.22 --> 2314.36]  phone
[2314.36 --> 2314.50]  that
[2314.50 --> 2314.76]  charges
[2314.76 --> 2314.94]  in
[2314.94 --> 2315.14]  30
[2315.14 --> 2315.56]  seconds
[2315.56 --> 2316.18]  look
[2316.18 --> 2316.30]  at
[2316.30 --> 2316.60]  this
[2316.60 --> 2316.92]  wow
[2316.92 --> 2317.82]  wow
[2317.82 --> 2318.90]  yes
[2318.90 --> 2319.32]  yes
[2319.32 --> 2320.24]  yes
[2320.24 --> 2320.84]  yes
[2320.84 --> 2321.26]  no
[2321.26 --> 2321.66]  doubt
[2321.66 --> 2322.00]  no
[2322.00 --> 2322.30]  doubt
[2322.30 --> 2322.62]  ever
[2322.62 --> 2323.06]  yes
[2323.06 --> 2323.58]  yes
[2323.58 --> 2325.62]  yes
[2325.62 --> 2326.16]  yes
[2326.16 --> 2327.06]  well
[2327.06 --> 2327.48]  there you
[2327.48 --> 2327.70]  go
[2327.70 --> 2328.00]  it's
[2328.00 --> 2328.54]  basically
[2328.54 --> 2329.70]  unanimous
[2329.70 --> 2330.10]  if we
[2330.10 --> 2330.44]  could get
[2330.44 --> 2330.84]  batteries
[2330.84 --> 2331.12]  that
[2331.12 --> 2331.68]  maybe
[2331.68 --> 2332.52]  aren't
[2332.52 --> 2332.82]  higher
[2332.82 --> 2333.44]  capacity
[2333.44 --> 2334.44]  but give
[2334.44 --> 2334.88]  us more
[2334.88 --> 2335.38]  flexibility
[2335.38 --> 2336.10]  in terms
[2336.10 --> 2336.52]  of how
[2336.52 --> 2337.20]  we use
[2337.20 --> 2337.50]  them in
[2337.50 --> 2337.90]  our daily
[2337.90 --> 2338.32]  lives
[2338.32 --> 2338.64]  like if
[2338.64 --> 2338.86]  you had
[2338.86 --> 2339.46]  a you know
[2339.46 --> 2339.86]  a charging
[2339.86 --> 2340.26]  pad in
[2340.26 --> 2340.64]  your car
[2340.64 --> 2340.90]  so you
[2340.90 --> 2341.12]  could just
[2341.12 --> 2341.34]  kind of
[2341.34 --> 2341.66]  chuck your
[2341.66 --> 2342.14]  phone on
[2342.14 --> 2342.46]  there when
[2342.46 --> 2342.74]  you get
[2342.74 --> 2343.04]  in the
[2343.04 --> 2343.34]  car
[2343.34 --> 2343.94]  and then
[2343.94 --> 2344.28]  it's like
[2344.28 --> 2344.66]  completely
[2344.66 --> 2344.98]  done
[2344.98 --> 2345.30]  you take
[2345.30 --> 2345.54]  it off
[2345.54 --> 2345.94]  like 30
[2345.94 --> 2346.30]  seconds
[2346.30 --> 2346.66]  later
[2346.66 --> 2347.24]  set it
[2347.24 --> 2347.48]  up with
[2347.48 --> 2347.92]  your nav
[2347.92 --> 2348.18]  and you're
[2348.18 --> 2348.48]  ready to
[2348.48 --> 2348.66]  go
[2348.66 --> 2349.00]  like if
[2349.00 --> 2349.52]  it changes
[2349.52 --> 2350.28]  the way
[2350.28 --> 2350.58]  that you
[2350.58 --> 2350.96]  use your
[2350.96 --> 2351.30]  device
[2351.30 --> 2351.90]  people are
[2351.90 --> 2352.42]  definitely
[2352.42 --> 2353.10]  still willing
[2353.10 --> 2353.46]  to pay
[2353.46 --> 2353.94]  a lot
[2353.94 --> 2354.76]  for phones
[2354.76 --> 2355.40]  which is
[2355.40 --> 2355.94]  something that
[2355.94 --> 2356.50]  I meant to
[2356.50 --> 2356.96]  discuss
[2356.96 --> 2357.52]  more
[2357.52 --> 2358.24]  in my
[2358.24 --> 2358.62]  M8
[2358.62 --> 2359.00]  review
[2359.00 --> 2359.78]  was
[2359.78 --> 2360.58]  is there
[2360.58 --> 2361.52]  still room
[2361.52 --> 2362.68]  for 600
[2362.68 --> 2363.42]  700
[2363.42 --> 2364.34]  800
[2364.34 --> 2364.78]  dollar
[2364.78 --> 2365.28]  flagship
[2365.28 --> 2365.84]  devices
[2365.84 --> 2366.82]  in a world
[2366.82 --> 2367.20]  where the
[2367.20 --> 2367.90]  Nexus 5
[2367.90 --> 2368.48]  exists
[2368.48 --> 2369.50]  at 300
[2369.50 --> 2370.50]  or 350
[2370.50 --> 2370.98]  dollars
[2370.98 --> 2371.34]  depending
[2371.34 --> 2371.66]  on the
[2371.66 --> 2372.12]  capacity
[2372.12 --> 2373.16]  and
[2373.16 --> 2374.54]  you know
[2374.54 --> 2374.84]  what
[2374.84 --> 2376.96]  before I
[2376.96 --> 2377.38]  had my
[2377.38 --> 2377.84]  hands on
[2377.84 --> 2378.34]  the M8
[2378.34 --> 2379.70]  I probably
[2379.70 --> 2380.14]  would have
[2380.14 --> 2380.76]  said no
[2380.76 --> 2382.10]  and
[2382.10 --> 2383.22]  when I
[2383.22 --> 2383.56]  get my
[2383.56 --> 2384.14]  hands on
[2384.14 --> 2384.46]  some of
[2384.46 --> 2384.72]  the new
[2384.72 --> 2384.96]  stuff
[2384.96 --> 2385.26]  that's
[2385.26 --> 2385.60]  coming
[2385.60 --> 2386.18]  like the
[2386.18 --> 2386.70]  OnePlus
[2386.70 --> 2387.44]  1
[2387.44 --> 2389.16]  I might
[2389.16 --> 2389.64]  say no
[2389.64 --> 2390.12]  again
[2390.12 --> 2391.04]  but the
[2391.04 --> 2391.60]  experience
[2391.60 --> 2392.04]  of using
[2392.04 --> 2392.60]  the M8
[2392.60 --> 2393.70]  really does
[2393.70 --> 2394.24]  justify
[2394.24 --> 2395.36]  maybe not
[2395.36 --> 2395.90]  as a
[2395.90 --> 2396.36]  discrete
[2396.36 --> 2396.94]  handset
[2396.94 --> 2397.28]  purchase
[2397.28 --> 2397.62]  like if
[2397.62 --> 2397.86]  I was
[2397.86 --> 2398.18]  someone who
[2398.18 --> 2398.50]  bought my
[2398.50 --> 2398.76]  phones
[2398.76 --> 2399.12]  outright
[2399.12 --> 2399.88]  so I'm
[2399.88 --> 2400.20]  spending
[2400.20 --> 2400.84]  twice as
[2400.84 --> 2401.06]  much
[2401.06 --> 2401.42]  on it
[2401.42 --> 2402.02]  maybe it
[2402.02 --> 2402.20]  doesn't
[2402.20 --> 2402.62]  justify it
[2402.62 --> 2402.82]  for me
[2402.82 --> 2403.14]  but it
[2403.14 --> 2403.42]  does
[2403.42 --> 2403.92]  justify
[2403.92 --> 2404.16]  the
[2404.16 --> 2404.58]  additional
[2404.58 --> 2405.10]  expense
[2405.10 --> 2405.68]  if I'm
[2405.68 --> 2406.12]  someone who
[2406.12 --> 2406.52]  buys on
[2406.52 --> 2406.96]  a carrier
[2406.96 --> 2407.48]  contract
[2407.48 --> 2408.24]  with a
[2408.24 --> 2408.78]  subsidized
[2408.78 --> 2409.10]  phone
[2409.10 --> 2409.40]  so I'm
[2409.40 --> 2409.94]  only paying
[2409.94 --> 2410.16]  another
[2410.16 --> 2410.42]  couple
[2410.76 --> 2411.06]  dollars
[2411.06 --> 2411.48]  for it
[2411.48 --> 2412.16]  I think
[2412.16 --> 2412.68]  there is
[2412.68 --> 2413.38]  still room
[2413.38 --> 2414.20]  for premium
[2414.20 --> 2414.62]  phones
[2414.62 --> 2415.16]  with premium
[2415.16 --> 2415.56]  features
[2415.56 --> 2416.16]  that really
[2416.16 --> 2416.70]  do feel
[2416.70 --> 2417.28]  different
[2417.28 --> 2418.32]  from plastic
[2418.32 --> 2418.76]  phones
[2418.76 --> 2419.54]  with plastic
[2419.54 --> 2420.00]  features
[2420.00 --> 2421.44]  for Samsung
[2421.44 --> 2422.04]  on the other
[2422.04 --> 2422.36]  hand
[2422.36 --> 2423.12]  not sure
[2423.12 --> 2423.58]  that I feel
[2423.58 --> 2423.98]  the same
[2423.98 --> 2424.30]  way
[2424.30 --> 2424.98]  where it's
[2424.98 --> 2425.40]  just like
[2425.40 --> 2425.64]  oh
[2425.64 --> 2426.46]  like wave
[2426.46 --> 2427.02]  at the phone
[2427.02 --> 2427.34]  in order
[2427.34 --> 2427.72]  to enable
[2427.72 --> 2428.16]  more features
[2428.16 --> 2429.04]  but like I
[2429.04 --> 2429.72]  said I haven't
[2429.72 --> 2430.24]  actually been
[2430.24 --> 2430.68]  hands-on
[2430.68 --> 2431.32]  with the S5
[2431.32 --> 2431.98]  I haven't
[2431.98 --> 2432.36]  heard back
[2432.36 --> 2432.68]  from them
[2432.68 --> 2433.14]  yet so I'm
[2433.14 --> 2433.52]  not sure
[2433.52 --> 2433.76]  if they're
[2433.76 --> 2433.98]  going to be
[2433.98 --> 2434.38]  sending me
[2434.38 --> 2434.58]  one
[2434.58 --> 2435.22]  I did say
[2435.22 --> 2435.60]  that I would
[2435.60 --> 2436.02]  talk about
[2436.02 --> 2436.30]  it on
[2436.30 --> 2436.76]  WANshow
[2436.76 --> 2437.48]  even if I
[2437.48 --> 2437.78]  don't do
[2437.78 --> 2438.22]  a dedicated
[2440.76 --> 2441.30]  even if it's
[2441.30 --> 2441.46]  not
[2441.46 --> 2442.12]  right I
[2442.12 --> 2442.40]  remember
[2442.40 --> 2442.70]  where I
[2442.70 --> 2443.04]  was going
[2443.04 --> 2443.36]  with that
[2443.36 --> 2443.88]  whole spiel
[2443.88 --> 2444.28]  before
[2444.28 --> 2445.90]  is the
[2445.90 --> 2446.72]  reason that
[2446.72 --> 2447.22]  I ask for
[2447.22 --> 2447.56]  a keeper
[2447.56 --> 2447.90]  unit
[2447.90 --> 2448.74]  is because
[2448.74 --> 2449.92]  I don't
[2449.92 --> 2450.64]  feel like
[2450.64 --> 2451.34]  setting it
[2451.34 --> 2452.18]  up and
[2452.18 --> 2453.02]  actually using
[2453.02 --> 2453.56]  it if I'm
[2453.56 --> 2453.84]  not going
[2453.84 --> 2454.22]  to actually
[2454.22 --> 2454.60]  use it
[2454.60 --> 2454.82]  enough
[2454.82 --> 2455.18]  I'm just
[2455.18 --> 2455.38]  going to
[2455.38 --> 2455.80]  have to
[2455.80 --> 2456.44]  wipe all
[2456.44 --> 2456.94]  my pictures
[2456.94 --> 2457.52]  and wipe
[2457.52 --> 2457.88]  all of my
[2457.88 --> 2458.44]  settings off
[2458.44 --> 2458.70]  of it
[2458.70 --> 2459.06]  shortly
[2459.06 --> 2459.80]  and then
[2459.80 --> 2460.54]  go and
[2460.54 --> 2461.06]  you know
[2461.06 --> 2462.54]  re-sync
[2462.54 --> 2463.42]  my actual
[2463.42 --> 2464.14]  daily driver
[2464.14 --> 2464.70]  back to
[2464.70 --> 2464.88]  it
[2464.88 --> 2465.40]  I mean
[2465.40 --> 2465.80]  it's one
[2465.80 --> 2466.38]  thing if I
[2466.38 --> 2466.66]  end up
[2466.66 --> 2467.04]  doing that
[2467.04 --> 2467.36]  anyway
[2467.36 --> 2467.94]  because I
[2467.94 --> 2468.22]  don't end
[2468.22 --> 2468.60]  up liking
[2468.60 --> 2469.14]  the device
[2469.14 --> 2469.80]  but that's
[2469.80 --> 2470.48]  that comes
[2470.48 --> 2470.76]  with the
[2470.76 --> 2471.08]  territory
[2471.08 --> 2471.84]  it's another
[2471.84 --> 2472.68]  thing if I
[2472.68 --> 2472.96]  end up
[2472.96 --> 2473.40]  liking the
[2473.40 --> 2474.24]  device and
[2474.24 --> 2474.76]  it becomes
[2474.76 --> 2475.48]  my favorite
[2475.48 --> 2476.46]  device which
[2476.46 --> 2477.18]  hasn't yet
[2477.18 --> 2477.68]  happened with
[2477.68 --> 2478.02]  a Samsung
[2478.02 --> 2478.58]  device so it
[2478.58 --> 2478.98]  hasn't really
[2478.98 --> 2479.24]  been that
[2479.24 --> 2479.52]  big of an
[2479.52 --> 2479.80]  issue but
[2479.80 --> 2480.00]  if it
[2480.00 --> 2480.50]  becomes my
[2480.50 --> 2480.74]  favorite
[2480.74 --> 2481.76]  device and
[2481.76 --> 2482.14]  then I
[2482.14 --> 2482.68]  send it
[2482.68 --> 2483.30]  away I
[2483.30 --> 2483.58]  go back
[2483.58 --> 2483.86]  to using
[2483.86 --> 2484.16]  something
[2484.16 --> 2485.06]  else new
[2485.06 --> 2485.78]  devices roll
[2485.78 --> 2486.24]  in and I
[2486.24 --> 2486.50]  want to
[2486.50 --> 2487.04]  compare them
[2487.04 --> 2487.64]  against something
[2487.64 --> 2487.94]  that I
[2487.94 --> 2488.44]  really like
[2488.44 --> 2488.62]  and I
[2488.62 --> 2488.90]  don't even
[2488.90 --> 2489.40]  have it in
[2489.40 --> 2489.84]  my hands
[2489.84 --> 2490.18]  anymore
[2490.18 --> 2491.14]  I believe
[2491.14 --> 2491.74]  that this
[2491.74 --> 2492.06]  is where I
[2492.06 --> 2492.30]  was trying
[2492.30 --> 2492.50]  to go
[2492.50 --> 2492.78]  with this
[2492.78 --> 2493.36]  I believe
[2493.36 --> 2494.26]  that comparative
[2494.26 --> 2494.86]  analysis
[2494.86 --> 2495.92]  needs to be
[2495.92 --> 2496.48]  done side
[2496.48 --> 2497.16]  by side
[2497.16 --> 2497.98]  and not
[2497.98 --> 2498.68]  from memory
[2498.68 --> 2499.58]  that was
[2499.58 --> 2499.94]  my whole
[2499.94 --> 2500.36]  point with
[2500.36 --> 2500.84]  that thing
[2500.84 --> 2502.34]  jeez
[2502.34 --> 2504.82]  alright so
[2504.82 --> 2505.52]  let's go
[2505.52 --> 2506.38]  aside from
[2506.38 --> 2507.14]  being a waste
[2507.14 --> 2507.98]  of time
[2507.98 --> 2508.34]  and money
[2508.34 --> 2508.74]  for me to
[2508.74 --> 2509.22]  make a video
[2509.22 --> 2509.62]  about it
[2509.62 --> 2509.90]  when you're
[2509.90 --> 2510.22]  not even
[2510.22 --> 2510.74]  willing to
[2510.74 --> 2511.12]  invest
[2511.12 --> 2511.84]  you know
[2511.84 --> 2512.64]  just well
[2512.64 --> 2512.98]  here's the
[2512.98 --> 2513.48]  product that
[2513.48 --> 2514.00]  you're doing
[2514.00 --> 2514.44]  us a favor
[2514.44 --> 2515.16]  by generating
[2515.16 --> 2515.86]  exposure for
[2515.86 --> 2517.20]  or not doing
[2517.20 --> 2517.84]  a favor if I
[2517.84 --> 2518.22]  end up giving
[2518.22 --> 2518.56]  a negative
[2518.56 --> 2519.06]  review but
[2519.06 --> 2519.64]  that comes
[2519.64 --> 2519.88]  with the
[2519.88 --> 2520.20]  territory
[2520.20 --> 2520.52]  that's
[2520.52 --> 2520.66]  any
[2520.66 --> 2521.26]  reviewer
[2521.26 --> 2522.32]  alright
[2522.32 --> 2523.96]  speaking of
[2523.96 --> 2524.66]  any reviewer
[2524.66 --> 2525.72]  there are
[2525.72 --> 2526.36]  any number
[2526.36 --> 2526.80]  of different
[2526.80 --> 2527.36]  reviews
[2527.36 --> 2528.20]  on the
[2528.20 --> 2528.86]  Radeon
[2528.86 --> 2530.96]  R9 295
[2530.96 --> 2531.62]  X2
[2531.62 --> 2532.92]  except one
[2532.92 --> 2533.78]  from yours
[2533.78 --> 2534.12]  truly
[2534.12 --> 2534.66]  because we
[2534.66 --> 2535.12]  didn't get
[2535.12 --> 2535.54]  seated a
[2535.54 --> 2535.74]  unit
[2535.74 --> 2536.16]  I've had
[2536.16 --> 2536.48]  quite a
[2536.48 --> 2537.18]  few people
[2537.18 --> 2537.82]  complain
[2537.82 --> 2538.82]  about the
[2538.82 --> 2539.14]  fact that
[2539.14 --> 2539.44]  we've been
[2539.44 --> 2539.84]  uploading
[2539.84 --> 2540.92]  speaker videos
[2540.92 --> 2541.74]  as opposed
[2541.74 --> 2542.64]  to an
[2542.64 --> 2544.56]  R9 295
[2544.56 --> 2544.98]  X2
[2544.98 --> 2545.34]  video
[2545.34 --> 2546.56]  and all
[2546.56 --> 2546.90]  I could
[2546.90 --> 2547.48]  really say
[2547.48 --> 2548.58]  is there's
[2548.58 --> 2549.06]  nothing I
[2549.06 --> 2549.50]  can do
[2549.50 --> 2550.36]  because AMD
[2550.36 --> 2550.72]  didn't
[2550.72 --> 2551.08]  see this
[2551.08 --> 2551.34]  one
[2551.34 --> 2552.20]  we were
[2552.20 --> 2552.66]  included
[2552.66 --> 2553.08]  in their
[2553.08 --> 2553.90]  viral marketing
[2553.90 --> 2554.44]  campaign
[2554.44 --> 2554.80]  where they
[2554.80 --> 2555.06]  sent
[2555.06 --> 2555.86]  pictures
[2555.86 --> 2557.06]  they sent
[2557.06 --> 2557.54]  a picture
[2557.54 --> 2558.32]  they sent
[2558.32 --> 2558.96]  Pringles
[2558.96 --> 2559.56]  and then
[2559.56 --> 2559.98]  they sent
[2559.98 --> 2560.56]  like this
[2560.56 --> 2561.28]  disc that
[2561.28 --> 2561.94]  had this
[2561.94 --> 2562.52]  like video
[2562.52 --> 2562.94]  on it
[2562.94 --> 2563.18]  that I
[2563.18 --> 2563.56]  didn't look
[2563.56 --> 2563.88]  at and
[2563.88 --> 2564.18]  then had
[2564.18 --> 2564.58]  a slide
[2564.58 --> 2564.92]  deck
[2564.92 --> 2565.54]  that actually
[2565.54 --> 2565.86]  told me
[2565.86 --> 2566.24]  everything I
[2566.24 --> 2566.54]  needed to
[2566.54 --> 2566.76]  know about
[2566.76 --> 2567.18]  the GPU
[2567.18 --> 2567.94]  and then I
[2567.94 --> 2568.42]  only found
[2568.42 --> 2568.84]  out a few
[2568.84 --> 2569.28]  days prior
[2569.28 --> 2569.72]  to launch
[2569.72 --> 2569.94]  when I
[2569.94 --> 2570.24]  was like
[2570.24 --> 2570.74]  hey
[2570.74 --> 2571.52]  are you guys
[2571.52 --> 2571.74]  going to
[2571.74 --> 2572.10]  follow up
[2572.10 --> 2572.32]  with a
[2572.32 --> 2572.62]  card at
[2572.62 --> 2573.00]  some point
[2573.00 --> 2573.24]  here
[2573.24 --> 2573.72]  that I
[2573.72 --> 2573.98]  wasn't
[2573.98 --> 2574.22]  getting
[2574.22 --> 2574.52]  one
[2574.52 --> 2575.78]  so I
[2575.78 --> 2576.24]  didn't get
[2576.24 --> 2576.54]  one
[2576.54 --> 2577.12]  that's why
[2577.12 --> 2577.44]  I couldn't
[2577.44 --> 2577.70]  bring you
[2577.70 --> 2578.00]  guys a
[2578.00 --> 2578.42]  review of
[2578.42 --> 2578.52]  it
[2578.52 --> 2579.08]  unfortunately
[2579.08 --> 2579.98]  I don't
[2579.98 --> 2580.34]  think I
[2580.34 --> 2580.76]  am going
[2580.76 --> 2581.16]  to get
[2581.16 --> 2581.42]  one
[2581.42 --> 2582.04]  from AMD
[2582.04 --> 2583.02]  I sent
[2583.02 --> 2584.28]  a yo
[2584.28 --> 2584.84]  what's
[2584.84 --> 2585.44]  going on
[2585.44 --> 2586.16]  follow up
[2586.16 --> 2587.46]  and I
[2587.46 --> 2587.80]  got a
[2587.80 --> 2588.30]  response
[2588.30 --> 2588.90]  that there
[2588.90 --> 2589.26]  may not
[2589.26 --> 2589.62]  be any
[2589.62 --> 2589.86]  more
[2589.86 --> 2590.28]  sample
[2590.28 --> 2590.62]  units
[2590.62 --> 2590.92]  or there
[2590.92 --> 2591.12]  might
[2591.12 --> 2591.32]  be
[2591.32 --> 2591.62]  but I
[2591.62 --> 2591.84]  haven't
[2591.84 --> 2591.98]  heard
[2591.98 --> 2592.26]  anything
[2592.26 --> 2592.62]  further
[2592.62 --> 2592.90]  yet
[2592.90 --> 2593.16]  so
[2593.16 --> 2593.64]  we'll
[2593.64 --> 2593.76]  see
[2593.76 --> 2593.92]  what
[2593.92 --> 2594.30]  happens

[2597.04 --> 2597.16]  so
[2597.16 --> 2597.34]  good
[2597.34 --> 2597.48]  news
[2597.48 --> 2597.68]  number
[2597.68 --> 2597.92]  one

[2656.88 --> 2657.08]  for
[2657.08 --> 2657.26]  me
[2657.26 --> 2657.62]  so
[2657.62 --> 2658.30]  you
[2658.30 --> 2658.72]  might
[2658.72 --> 2659.28]  see

[2661.20 --> 2661.58]  see
[2661.58 --> 2662.00]  some

[2662.44 --> 2662.78]  once
[2662.78 --> 2662.92]  we
[2662.92 --> 2663.06]  get
[2663.06 --> 2663.16]  it
[2663.16 --> 2663.30]  on

[2663.78 --> 2664.24]  or
[2664.24 --> 2664.46]  you
[2664.46 --> 2664.64]  might
[2664.64 --> 2664.90]  not
[2664.90 --> 2665.18]  because
[2665.18 --> 2665.38]  we're
[2665.38 --> 2665.54]  pretty
[2665.54 --> 2665.74]  late
[2665.74 --> 2665.86]  to

[2666.10 --> 2666.22]  at
[2666.22 --> 2666.34]  this
[2666.34 --> 2666.50]  point
[2666.50 --> 2666.78]  anyway
[2666.78 --> 2667.30]  but
[2667.30 --> 2667.54]  let's
[2667.54 --> 2667.72]  get
[2667.72 --> 2668.10]  into
[2668.10 --> 2668.66]  how
[2668.66 --> 2669.26]  the

[2669.82 --> 2670.98]  sources
[2670.98 --> 2671.24]  of

[2671.72 --> 2672.46]  have
[2672.46 --> 2673.04]  evaluated
[2673.04 --> 2673.42]  this
[2673.42 --> 2673.70]  card
[2673.70 --> 2673.94]  since
[2673.94 --> 2674.08]  we
[2674.08 --> 2674.28]  haven't
[2674.28 --> 2674.54]  tested
[2674.54 --> 2674.90]  ourselves
[2674.90 --> 2675.26]  so
[2675.26 --> 2675.50]  from
[2675.50 --> 2675.96]  BitTech
[2675.96 --> 2677.16]  they
[2677.16 --> 2677.46]  say
[2677.46 --> 2678.02]  in

[2678.38 --> 2678.72]  every

[2679.00 --> 2679.20]  the

[2679.52 --> 2680.14]  295

[2681.76 --> 2682.34]  done
[2682.34 --> 2682.78]  right
[2682.78 --> 2683.36]  in
[2683.36 --> 2683.54]  every
[2683.54 --> 2684.02]  situation
[2684.02 --> 2684.20]  it
[2684.20 --> 2684.44]  simply
[2684.44 --> 2684.86]  works
[2684.86 --> 2685.26]  and
[2685.26 --> 2685.72]  damn
[2685.72 --> 2686.08]  well
[2686.08 --> 2686.36]  too
[2686.36 --> 2686.54]  as
[2686.54 --> 2686.72]  its
[2686.72 --> 2687.06]  scaling
[2687.06 --> 2687.30]  is
[2687.30 --> 2687.86]  seriously
[2687.86 --> 2688.94]  impressive
[2688.94 --> 2689.64]  so
[2689.64 --> 2689.76]  it's
[2689.76 --> 2689.90]  got
[2689.90 --> 2690.04]  a

[2694.02 --> 2694.68]  290X
[2694.68 --> 2695.84]  and
[2695.84 --> 2697.22]  it
[2697.22 --> 2697.62]  performs
[2697.62 --> 2697.94]  about
[2697.94 --> 2698.22]  like
[2698.22 --> 2698.48]  what you
[2698.48 --> 2698.64]  would
[2698.64 --> 2699.04]  expect
[2699.04 --> 2699.52]  however
[2699.52 --> 2700.06]  you
[2700.06 --> 2700.50]  can
[2700.50 --> 2701.20]  again
[2701.20 --> 2702.00]  expect

[2704.28 --> 2704.90]  290X
[2704.90 --> 2705.62]  to
[2705.62 --> 2706.24]  give you
[2706.24 --> 2706.58]  similar

[2706.94 --> 2707.12]  better
[2707.12 --> 2707.62]  performance
[2707.62 --> 2707.94]  because
[2707.94 --> 2708.32]  they
[2708.32 --> 2708.48]  have
[2708.48 --> 2708.64]  their

[2709.56 --> 2709.98]  circuitry
[2709.98 --> 2710.12]  that
[2710.12 --> 2710.30]  has
[2710.30 --> 2710.48]  more
[2710.48 --> 2710.70]  room
[2710.70 --> 2710.88]  to
[2710.88 --> 2711.32]  breathe
[2711.32 --> 2711.90]  and
[2711.90 --> 2712.04]  you
[2712.04 --> 2712.16]  can
[2712.16 --> 2712.54]  potentially
[2712.54 --> 2712.96]  squeeze
[2712.96 --> 2713.22]  more

[2714.20 --> 2714.52]  for
[2714.52 --> 2714.90]  that
[2714.90 --> 2715.30]  reason
[2715.30 --> 2715.84]  so
[2715.84 --> 2716.10]  just
[2716.10 --> 2716.34]  like

[2721.14 --> 2721.40]  a really

[2722.08 --> 2722.26]  and
[2722.26 --> 2722.42]  that

[2722.64 --> 2722.86]  that
[2722.86 --> 2723.04]  you
[2723.04 --> 2723.22]  will
[2723.22 --> 2723.40]  be
[2723.40 --> 2723.76]  able

[2730.38 --> 2731.20]  Titan Z
[2731.20 --> 2731.98]  clearly
[2731.98 --> 2732.24]  though
[2732.24 --> 2732.48]  that
[2732.48 --> 2732.96]  comparison
[2732.96 --> 2733.40]  leaves
[2733.40 --> 2733.78]  one
[2733.78 --> 2734.20]  super
[2734.20 --> 2734.76]  dreadnought
[2734.76 --> 2735.30]  smoldering
[2735.30 --> 2735.60]  that's a
[2735.60 --> 2735.72]  quote
[2735.72 --> 2736.20]  from Tom's
[2736.20 --> 2736.42]  hardware
[2736.42 --> 2737.06]  because
[2737.06 --> 2737.46]  the
[2737.46 --> 2738.06]  Titan Z
[2738.06 --> 2739.06]  costs
[2739.06 --> 2740.34]  $3,000
[2740.34 --> 2741.04]  or twice
[2741.04 --> 2741.54]  the price
[2741.54 --> 2742.18]  and is
[2742.18 --> 2742.52]  probably
[2742.52 --> 2742.80]  going to
[2742.80 --> 2743.12]  perform
[2743.12 --> 2743.64]  similarly
[2743.64 --> 2744.30]  if not
[2744.30 --> 2744.70]  actually
[2744.70 --> 2745.06]  a little
[2745.06 --> 2745.26]  bit
[2745.26 --> 2745.62]  worse
[2745.62 --> 2745.96]  with the
[2745.96 --> 2746.14]  key
[2746.14 --> 2746.48]  difference
[2746.48 --> 2746.72]  being
[2746.72 --> 2746.86]  that
[2746.86 --> 2746.94]  it
[2746.94 --> 2747.02]  is
[2747.02 --> 2747.26]  air
[2747.26 --> 2747.58]  cooled
[2747.58 --> 2748.06]  but
[2748.06 --> 2748.30]  would
[2748.30 --> 2748.44]  you
[2748.44 --> 2748.90]  really
[2748.90 --> 2749.52]  pay
[2749.52 --> 2750.54]  twice
[2750.54 --> 2750.74]  as
[2750.74 --> 2751.12]  much
[2751.12 --> 2751.40]  for
[2751.40 --> 2751.62]  air
[2751.62 --> 2751.86]  cooling
[2751.86 --> 2752.10]  versus
[2752.10 --> 2752.40]  water
[2752.40 --> 2752.70]  cooling
[2752.70 --> 2752.88]  or
[2752.88 --> 2753.02]  would
[2753.02 --> 2753.14]  you
[2753.14 --> 2753.50]  rather
[2753.50 --> 2753.82]  buy
[2753.82 --> 2754.36]  two
[2754.36 --> 2755.34]  295
[2755.34 --> 2755.82]  X2
[2755.82 --> 2756.50]  if you
[2756.50 --> 2756.68]  can
[2756.68 --> 2756.94]  figure
[2756.94 --> 2757.30]  out
[2757.30 --> 2757.84]  where
[2757.84 --> 2758.02]  to
[2758.02 --> 2758.30]  put
[2758.30 --> 2758.70]  both
[2758.70 --> 2758.80]  of
[2758.80 --> 2759.02]  those
[2759.02 --> 2759.62]  radiators
[2759.62 --> 2759.96]  in fact
[2759.96 --> 2760.22]  there are
[2760.22 --> 2760.42]  some
[2760.42 --> 2760.70]  cases
[2760.70 --> 2760.94]  that
[2760.94 --> 2761.12]  will
[2761.12 --> 2761.50]  support
[2761.50 --> 2761.86]  that
[2761.86 --> 2762.62]  so
[2762.62 --> 2763.14]  there's
[2763.14 --> 2763.36]  the
[2763.36 --> 2763.78]  overall
[2763.78 --> 2764.32]  impressions
[2764.32 --> 2764.58]  of the
[2764.58 --> 2765.10]  295
[2765.10 --> 2765.50]  X2
[2765.50 --> 2766.02]  I don't
[2766.02 --> 2766.22]  think
[2766.22 --> 2766.62]  I have
[2766.62 --> 2767.14]  too much
[2767.14 --> 2767.56]  else
[2767.56 --> 2768.46]  to really
[2768.46 --> 2769.42]  say about
[2769.42 --> 2769.72]  it
[2769.72 --> 2770.46]  other than
[2770.46 --> 2770.80]  that
[2770.80 --> 2771.60]  I do
[2771.60 --> 2773.46]  appreciate
[2773.46 --> 2774.60]  what AMD
[2774.60 --> 2775.10]  has done
[2775.10 --> 2775.44]  with their
[2775.44 --> 2776.24]  last two
[2776.24 --> 2776.78]  dual GPU
[2776.78 --> 2777.24]  cards
[2777.24 --> 2777.58]  so
[2777.58 --> 2778.62]  with the
[2778.62 --> 2780.54]  shoot
[2780.54 --> 2781.06]  I can't even
[2781.06 --> 2781.82]  remember their
[2781.82 --> 2782.44]  bloody branding
[2782.44 --> 2782.88]  for the thing
[2782.88 --> 2783.80]  the 7990
[2783.80 --> 2784.36]  there we go
[2784.36 --> 2784.92]  with the
[2784.92 --> 2785.30]  79
[2785.30 --> 2785.94]  they change
[2785.94 --> 2786.10]  it
[2786.10 --> 2786.94]  every generation
[2786.94 --> 2787.34]  they've done
[2787.34 --> 2787.68]  it again
[2787.68 --> 2788.02]  it's like
[2788.02 --> 2788.34]  is it a
[2788.34 --> 2789.40]  3870 X2
[2789.40 --> 2789.98]  or is it a
[2789.98 --> 2792.32]  4870 X2
[2792.32 --> 2793.10]  or is it a
[2793.10 --> 2795.02]  5990
[2795.02 --> 2795.44]  or whatever
[2795.44 --> 2796.00]  they call that
[2796.00 --> 2796.14]  thing
[2796.14 --> 2796.54]  they change
[2796.54 --> 2796.78]  it every
[2796.78 --> 2797.10]  generation
[2797.10 --> 2797.54]  so with the
[2797.54 --> 2798.44]  7990
[2798.44 --> 2799.98]  they introduced
[2799.98 --> 2801.38]  an open air
[2801.38 --> 2801.88]  cooler
[2801.88 --> 2802.84]  and this was
[2802.84 --> 2803.58]  because they
[2803.58 --> 2804.04]  had to
[2804.04 --> 2804.46]  in order to
[2804.46 --> 2804.74]  keep the
[2804.74 --> 2805.14]  bloody thing
[2805.14 --> 2805.40]  cool
[2805.40 --> 2805.94]  so what that
[2805.94 --> 2806.20]  meant
[2806.20 --> 2806.54]  was
[2806.54 --> 2807.26]  worse case
[2807.26 --> 2807.76]  temperatures
[2807.76 --> 2808.44]  but better
[2808.44 --> 2808.88]  GPU
[2808.88 --> 2809.44]  temperatures
[2809.44 --> 2810.80]  and I
[2810.80 --> 2811.10]  looked at
[2811.10 --> 2811.36]  that and
[2811.36 --> 2811.50]  I went
[2811.50 --> 2811.80]  that's
[2811.80 --> 2812.20]  great
[2812.20 --> 2813.20]  why are
[2813.20 --> 2813.82]  we relying
[2813.82 --> 2815.08]  on the
[2815.08 --> 2816.38]  GPU
[2816.38 --> 2817.06]  card
[2817.06 --> 2817.86]  manufacturers
[2817.86 --> 2818.68]  to give
[2818.68 --> 2819.20]  us these
[2819.20 --> 2819.92]  non-reference
[2819.92 --> 2820.82]  cooler designs
[2820.82 --> 2821.42]  that keep
[2821.42 --> 2821.86]  the GPU
[2821.86 --> 2822.22]  cooler
[2822.22 --> 2822.96]  I understand
[2822.96 --> 2823.70]  that blower
[2823.70 --> 2824.54]  designs are
[2824.54 --> 2825.08]  better for
[2825.08 --> 2825.72]  certain builds
[2825.72 --> 2826.34]  but when we're
[2826.34 --> 2826.86]  talking dual
[2826.86 --> 2827.60]  GPU cards
[2827.60 --> 2828.14]  I think
[2828.14 --> 2829.12]  we're talking
[2829.12 --> 2829.74]  about systems
[2829.74 --> 2830.40]  that better have
[2830.40 --> 2830.80]  some airflow
[2830.80 --> 2831.24]  through them
[2831.24 --> 2831.48]  anyway
[2831.48 --> 2832.14]  so I appreciated
[2832.14 --> 2832.92]  that and I
[2832.92 --> 2833.66]  appreciate once
[2833.66 --> 2834.84]  again that AMD
[2834.84 --> 2835.80]  has made this
[2835.80 --> 2836.88]  card water cooling
[2836.88 --> 2838.52]  out of the box
[2838.52 --> 2839.68]  so yeah
[2839.68 --> 2840.48]  it's only a
[2840.48 --> 2841.26]  single 120
[2841.26 --> 2841.68]  millimeter
[2841.68 --> 2842.24]  radiator
[2842.24 --> 2843.40]  and yeah
[2843.40 --> 2843.88]  it's an
[2843.88 --> 2844.36]  ace attack
[2844.36 --> 2844.82]  all-in-one
[2844.82 --> 2845.22]  solution
[2845.22 --> 2845.66]  so it's not
[2845.66 --> 2845.96]  the greatest
[2845.96 --> 2846.30]  performing
[2846.30 --> 2846.68]  thing in the
[2846.68 --> 2846.86]  world
[2846.86 --> 2848.16]  but what I
[2848.16 --> 2848.80]  think a lot
[2848.80 --> 2849.12]  of people
[2849.12 --> 2849.70]  were surprised
[2849.70 --> 2850.28]  to discover
[2850.28 --> 2851.16]  is that on
[2851.16 --> 2851.66]  a graphics
[2851.66 --> 2852.12]  card you
[2852.12 --> 2852.90]  don't need
[2852.90 --> 2853.34]  the greatest
[2853.34 --> 2853.70]  thing in
[2853.70 --> 2854.14]  the world
[2854.14 --> 2854.76]  in order
[2854.76 --> 2855.30]  to still
[2855.30 --> 2856.36]  get really
[2856.36 --> 2857.26]  really impressive
[2857.26 --> 2857.76]  thermals
[2857.76 --> 2858.22]  like I've
[2858.22 --> 2858.82]  seen reports
[2858.82 --> 2859.26]  around the
[2859.26 --> 2859.92]  web of
[2859.92 --> 2860.42]  these cards
[2860.42 --> 2861.04]  running as
[2861.04 --> 2861.78]  low as
[2861.78 --> 2862.20]  you know
[2862.20 --> 2862.74]  60 to
[2862.74 --> 2863.68]  70 degrees
[2863.68 --> 2864.60]  under load
[2864.60 --> 2865.96]  that's running
[2865.96 --> 2866.90]  at full speed
[2866.90 --> 2868.60]  because people
[2868.60 --> 2869.70]  look at their
[2869.70 --> 2871.12]  CPU and the
[2871.12 --> 2871.76]  temperatures a
[2871.76 --> 2872.62]  CPU runs at
[2872.62 --> 2873.70]  and they look
[2873.70 --> 2874.24]  at their GPU
[2874.24 --> 2875.02]  and they look
[2875.02 --> 2875.28]  at the
[2875.28 --> 2875.86]  temperatures a
[2875.86 --> 2876.62]  GPU runs at
[2876.62 --> 2877.16]  and I think
[2877.16 --> 2877.76]  the assumption
[2877.76 --> 2879.16]  is that there's
[2879.16 --> 2879.92]  some kind of
[2879.92 --> 2881.36]  correlation between
[2881.36 --> 2882.22]  something's
[2882.22 --> 2883.48]  temperature and
[2883.48 --> 2884.08]  the amount of
[2884.08 --> 2885.08]  heat that it is
[2885.08 --> 2885.66]  outputting
[2885.66 --> 2886.52]  but there isn't
[2886.52 --> 2888.08]  your CPU has
[2888.08 --> 2889.12]  a much more
[2889.12 --> 2890.08]  optimized cooler
[2890.08 --> 2890.64]  on it because
[2890.64 --> 2891.40]  it has a lot
[2891.40 --> 2892.20]  more space
[2892.20 --> 2892.96]  so just because
[2892.96 --> 2893.50]  they both run
[2893.50 --> 2894.22]  at 80 degrees
[2894.22 --> 2895.20]  doesn't mean
[2895.20 --> 2895.84]  that a GPU
[2895.84 --> 2896.78]  actually kicks
[2896.78 --> 2897.42]  out that much
[2897.42 --> 2898.06]  heat compared
[2898.06 --> 2898.70]  to a CPU
[2898.70 --> 2899.76]  so just because
[2899.76 --> 2900.32]  you could throw
[2900.32 --> 2901.08]  an overclocked
[2901.08 --> 2902.18]  CPU on a
[2902.18 --> 2903.30]  slim 120mm
[2903.30 --> 2904.22]  radiator design
[2904.22 --> 2904.98]  and you still
[2904.98 --> 2905.70]  get like you
[2905.70 --> 2906.50]  know 80-90
[2906.50 --> 2907.30]  degrees on it
[2907.30 --> 2908.52]  it's like yeah
[2908.52 --> 2909.40]  why did I even
[2909.40 --> 2909.94]  do that
[2909.94 --> 2910.64]  when you throw
[2910.64 --> 2911.38]  that on two
[2911.38 --> 2912.62]  GPUs you can
[2912.62 --> 2913.28]  get great
[2913.28 --> 2914.48]  results because
[2914.48 --> 2915.32]  now you're
[2915.32 --> 2915.84]  taking that
[2915.84 --> 2916.46]  cooling out of
[2916.46 --> 2917.42]  that horrible
[2917.42 --> 2918.20]  form factor
[2918.20 --> 2919.46]  that dual slot
[2919.46 --> 2920.12]  form factor
[2920.12 --> 2920.70]  that's just
[2920.70 --> 2921.54]  totally inadequate
[2921.54 --> 2922.36]  and you're
[2922.36 --> 2922.98]  moving it to
[2922.98 --> 2923.68]  a nice big
[2923.68 --> 2925.04]  120mm fan
[2925.04 --> 2925.86]  that's getting
[2925.86 --> 2926.52]  the heat from
[2926.52 --> 2927.24]  those GPUs
[2927.24 --> 2927.72]  carried to
[2927.72 --> 2928.56]  it by water
[2928.56 --> 2929.18]  which is much
[2929.18 --> 2929.66]  more efficient
[2929.66 --> 2930.10]  than air
[2930.10 --> 2931.22]  so I think
[2931.22 --> 2931.92]  that's a really
[2931.92 --> 2932.64]  innovative really
[2932.64 --> 2933.34]  cool thing that
[2933.34 --> 2934.20]  AMD has done
[2934.20 --> 2935.24]  with the
[2935.24 --> 2936.54]  what's what's
[2936.54 --> 2936.84]  I'm saying
[2936.84 --> 2937.44]  what's incorrect
[2937.44 --> 2938.24]  hold on
[2938.24 --> 2939.96]  I'm curious now
[2939.96 --> 2940.60]  twitch chat
[2940.60 --> 2941.12]  someone's saying
[2941.12 --> 2941.58]  I'm incorrect
[2941.58 --> 2942.30]  about something
[2942.30 --> 2947.92]  no I don't
[2947.92 --> 2948.08]  know what you're
[2948.08 --> 2948.42]  talking about
[2948.42 --> 2948.66]  anymore
[2948.66 --> 2949.68]  oh someone says
[2949.68 --> 2950.44]  that's incorrect
[2950.44 --> 2952.16]  I'm pretty sure
[2952.16 --> 2952.78]  that nothing I
[2952.78 --> 2953.34]  said there was
[2953.34 --> 2954.24]  actually incorrect
[2954.24 --> 2956.00]  yeah
[2956.00 --> 2956.90]  okay
[2956.90 --> 2958.10]  anyway
[2958.10 --> 2959.80]  someone asked
[2959.80 --> 2960.32]  where's Luke
[2960.32 --> 2961.12]  he's at PAX
[2961.12 --> 2961.98]  so there
[2961.98 --> 2962.66]  I did some
[2962.66 --> 2963.24]  twitch chat
[2963.24 --> 2963.86]  interaction
[2963.86 --> 2964.54]  especially now
[2964.54 --> 2965.04]  that it's
[2965.04 --> 2966.00]  now that it's
[2966.00 --> 2966.78]  not a total
[2966.78 --> 2967.98]  disaster in there
[2967.98 --> 2968.58]  you know what
[2968.58 --> 2969.30]  speaking of total
[2969.30 --> 2969.86]  disasters
[2969.86 --> 2970.64]  this isn't a
[2970.64 --> 2971.20]  total disaster
[2971.20 --> 2971.48]  at all
[2971.48 --> 2971.98]  but let's go
[2971.98 --> 2972.54]  ahead and get
[2972.54 --> 2972.98]  into our
[2972.98 --> 2973.60]  sponsor break
[2973.60 --> 2973.78]  here
[2973.78 --> 2974.16]  so
[2974.16 --> 2975.28]  our first
[2975.28 --> 2975.88]  sponsor of the
[2975.88 --> 2976.52]  show today
[2976.52 --> 2978.00]  is ASUS
[2978.00 --> 2979.92]  this my friends
[2979.92 --> 2982.42]  is the G750JZ
[2982.42 --> 2983.50]  and what I really
[2983.50 --> 2984.32]  wanted to be able
[2984.32 --> 2985.34]  to do on our
[2985.34 --> 2986.14]  first spot
[2986.14 --> 2987.48]  for ASUS's new
[2987.48 --> 2988.58]  ultimate performance
[2988.58 --> 2989.34]  gaming notebook
[2989.34 --> 2991.20]  was have used it
[2991.20 --> 2991.88]  a fair bit
[2991.88 --> 2993.04]  and tell you a little
[2993.04 --> 2993.56]  bit about the
[2993.56 --> 2994.36]  gaming performance
[2994.36 --> 2995.34]  and a little bit
[2995.34 --> 2995.98]  about what it's
[2995.98 --> 2996.70]  like to use it
[2996.70 --> 2997.64]  but unfortunately
[2997.64 --> 2998.96]  Luke took the
[2998.96 --> 2999.84]  one that I
[2999.84 --> 3000.96]  started setting up
[3000.96 --> 3001.78]  so I was able to
[3001.78 --> 3002.80]  use a couple of
[3002.80 --> 3003.04]  things
[3003.04 --> 3003.72]  I definitely
[3003.72 --> 3004.52]  appreciate their
[3004.52 --> 3005.00]  new keyboard
[3005.00 --> 3005.44]  implementation
[3005.44 --> 3006.02]  with nice
[3006.02 --> 3006.90]  long travel time
[3006.90 --> 3007.66]  and I was able
[3007.66 --> 3008.12]  to set up a
[3008.12 --> 3008.38]  couple of
[3008.38 --> 3008.56]  things
[3008.56 --> 3009.02]  I definitely
[3009.02 --> 3009.70]  appreciate the
[3009.70 --> 3010.20]  looks and the
[3010.20 --> 3010.56]  fact that it
[3010.56 --> 3011.28]  actually runs
[3011.28 --> 3012.14]  cool enough
[3012.14 --> 3012.88]  that I'm running
[3012.88 --> 3013.50]  this thing on
[3013.50 --> 3014.26]  my lap
[3014.26 --> 3014.76]  right now
[3014.76 --> 3015.32]  which you can't
[3015.32 --> 3016.02]  always say about
[3016.02 --> 3016.58]  gaming grade
[3016.58 --> 3016.96]  notebooks
[3016.96 --> 3018.72]  Luke took it
[3018.72 --> 3019.18]  from me
[3019.18 --> 3019.82]  and was like
[3019.82 --> 3020.64]  oh hey
[3020.64 --> 3021.50]  that's our
[3021.50 --> 3022.10]  editing machine
[3022.10 --> 3022.76]  for PAX East
[3022.76 --> 3023.28]  bye
[3023.28 --> 3025.18]  so I was like
[3025.18 --> 3026.12]  okay I was
[3026.12 --> 3026.68]  actually gonna
[3026.68 --> 3027.46]  use that
[3027.46 --> 3028.58]  so we do
[3028.58 --> 3029.22]  have two of
[3029.22 --> 3029.86]  them so each
[3029.86 --> 3030.40]  of us will be
[3030.40 --> 3031.08]  using them for
[3031.08 --> 3031.72]  about the next
[3031.72 --> 3032.46]  eight weeks
[3032.46 --> 3033.00]  which will give
[3033.00 --> 3033.62]  you guys by
[3033.62 --> 3034.20]  the end of it
[3034.20 --> 3034.82]  a pretty good
[3034.82 --> 3035.42]  idea of what
[3035.42 --> 3035.92]  it's like for
[3035.92 --> 3036.34]  us to use
[3036.34 --> 3036.62]  them we'll
[3036.62 --> 3037.24]  definitely talk
[3037.24 --> 3037.58]  about our
[3037.58 --> 3038.16]  impressions on
[3038.16 --> 3038.76]  the show here
[3038.76 --> 3039.90]  but it just
[3039.90 --> 3040.48]  means that the
[3040.48 --> 3040.96]  one that I had
[3040.96 --> 3041.68]  set up wasn't
[3041.68 --> 3042.26]  set up and I
[3042.26 --> 3042.76]  had to like
[3042.76 --> 3043.40]  pull it out of
[3043.40 --> 3044.12]  the box now
[3044.12 --> 3044.56]  at the last
[3044.56 --> 3044.98]  minute get
[3044.98 --> 3045.60]  everything installed
[3045.60 --> 3046.14]  on it in order
[3046.14 --> 3046.94]  to just do the
[3046.94 --> 3048.46]  show at all
[3048.46 --> 3049.30]  today but what
[3049.30 --> 3050.08]  it also means is
[3050.08 --> 3050.90]  it gives me a
[3050.90 --> 3051.74]  way to talk
[3051.74 --> 3052.76]  about the ways
[3052.76 --> 3053.66]  that these high
[3053.66 --> 3054.58]  performance notebooks
[3054.58 --> 3055.84]  can be used
[3055.84 --> 3056.88]  it's not always
[3056.88 --> 3057.48]  just about
[3057.48 --> 3057.88]  gaming
[3057.88 --> 3059.22]  Luke the first
[3059.22 --> 3059.66]  thing that went
[3059.66 --> 3060.28]  through his mind
[3060.28 --> 3062.08]  was holy crap
[3062.08 --> 3063.50]  thunderbolt port
[3063.50 --> 3065.72]  core i7 quad core
[3065.72 --> 3066.50]  with hyper threading
[3066.50 --> 3067.08]  so nice high
[3067.08 --> 3067.92]  performance cpu
[3067.92 --> 3071.34]  and 880m graphics
[3071.34 --> 3072.58]  card which can be
[3072.58 --> 3073.52]  used for cuda
[3073.52 --> 3074.64]  acceleration in
[3074.64 --> 3075.22]  premiere and he
[3075.22 --> 3076.20]  was like mobile
[3076.20 --> 3076.92]  workstation
[3076.92 --> 3077.92]  yoink
[3077.92 --> 3079.30]  it's because normally
[3079.30 --> 3080.58]  when we travel we
[3080.58 --> 3081.92]  would take a shuttle
[3081.92 --> 3083.46]  or um or a
[3083.46 --> 3084.58]  silverstone sugo
[3084.58 --> 3085.94]  machine that has
[3085.94 --> 3086.96]  like a full size
[3086.96 --> 3088.68]  desktop cpu in
[3088.68 --> 3089.48]  it so actually we
[3089.48 --> 3090.60]  use six cores for
[3090.60 --> 3091.22]  almost all of our
[3091.22 --> 3091.94]  editing machines and
[3091.94 --> 3093.04]  normally we take that
[3093.04 --> 3094.18]  when we travel but
[3094.18 --> 3094.94]  because luke and
[3094.94 --> 3095.74]  brandon are traveling
[3095.74 --> 3096.62]  to pax east on their
[3096.62 --> 3097.78]  own this time they
[3097.78 --> 3099.18]  were really excited
[3099.18 --> 3099.98]  about the opportunity
[3099.98 --> 3100.98]  to take a notebook
[3100.98 --> 3102.98]  that is fully like
[3102.98 --> 3104.10]  high quality video
[3104.10 --> 3105.22]  editing capable so
[3105.22 --> 3105.98]  brandon doesn't have
[3105.98 --> 3107.00]  to lug his ancient
[3107.00 --> 3108.20]  heavy thing that's
[3108.20 --> 3109.20]  like super super slow
[3109.20 --> 3110.00]  and they don't have
[3110.00 --> 3111.00]  to take a desktop so
[3111.00 --> 3111.82]  there you go guys
[3111.82 --> 3113.38]  the workstation usage
[3113.38 --> 3114.90]  model is another valid
[3114.90 --> 3115.76]  one for stuff like
[3115.76 --> 3116.64]  this and of course you
[3116.64 --> 3117.44]  can play games on the
[3117.44 --> 3118.72]  go if you want as
[3118.72 --> 3120.40]  well so let's move
[3120.40 --> 3121.68]  into our next one
[3121.68 --> 3122.68]  this is another
[3122.68 --> 3124.78]  I'm trying to talk
[3124.78 --> 3125.62]  about our sponsors
[3125.62 --> 3126.26]  here right
[3126.26 --> 3127.32]  dollar shave club
[3127.32 --> 3129.28]  so normally I would
[3129.28 --> 3130.30]  have my little bin
[3130.30 --> 3131.64]  that has all of the
[3131.64 --> 3132.50]  different dollar shave
[3132.50 --> 3133.36]  club handles
[3133.36 --> 3134.72]  their shave butter
[3134.72 --> 3135.96]  as well as the one
[3135.96 --> 3136.74]  wipe charlies that's
[3136.74 --> 3137.38]  the one thing that
[3137.38 --> 3138.42]  these guys left for me
[3138.42 --> 3139.40]  and I would be able
[3139.40 --> 3140.44]  to hold them up and
[3140.44 --> 3141.58]  talk about how
[3141.58 --> 3142.50]  dollar shave club
[3142.50 --> 3143.98]  is a great way to
[3143.98 --> 3145.66]  save money and save
[3145.66 --> 3147.14]  time by not dealing
[3147.14 --> 3148.30]  with the hassle of
[3148.30 --> 3149.32]  going to the store
[3149.32 --> 3150.90]  and finding a sales
[3150.90 --> 3152.30]  person to you know
[3152.30 --> 3153.28]  unlock the cabinet
[3153.28 --> 3154.24]  for you and give you
[3154.24 --> 3155.86]  new razors and then
[3155.86 --> 3156.64]  pay a bunch of money
[3156.64 --> 3157.46]  for them and then go
[3157.46 --> 3158.18]  home and just
[3158.18 --> 3159.86]  waste time waste money
[3159.86 --> 3160.96]  so I would be able to
[3160.96 --> 3161.70]  talk about how it's
[3161.70 --> 3162.42]  great and I'd be able
[3162.42 --> 3163.20]  to like hold up the
[3163.20 --> 3164.18]  razors and show you
[3164.18 --> 3166.06]  but the razors are so
[3166.06 --> 3168.28]  good that my staff has
[3168.28 --> 3169.60]  absconded with all of
[3169.60 --> 3171.84]  them so I did offer
[3171.84 --> 3174.30]  Luke to try before
[3174.30 --> 3175.44]  blade one so I gave
[3175.44 --> 3177.80]  him both the package
[3177.80 --> 3178.64]  of cartridges that
[3178.64 --> 3179.26]  comes with your
[3179.26 --> 3180.24]  monthly subscription
[3180.24 --> 3181.08]  to dollar shave club
[3181.08 --> 3182.88]  and the handle which
[3182.88 --> 3184.28]  he promptly took with
[3184.28 --> 3186.94]  him to PAX so and
[3186.94 --> 3187.62]  those of you who were
[3187.62 --> 3188.40]  saying in the last
[3188.40 --> 3189.20]  dollar shave club ad
[3189.20 --> 3190.70]  that we did within our
[3190.70 --> 3191.58]  video that Luke
[3191.58 --> 3192.70]  doesn't shave yes he
[3192.70 --> 3193.48]  does people with
[3193.48 --> 3194.60]  beards still shave you
[3194.60 --> 3195.46]  guys they have to like
[3195.46 --> 3196.28]  shape them and clean
[3196.28 --> 3196.82]  them up and stuff
[3196.82 --> 3198.02]  anyway so Luke took
[3198.02 --> 3198.78]  that away with them so
[3198.78 --> 3199.46]  I don't have anything to
[3199.46 --> 3200.48]  show you there and
[3200.48 --> 3202.48]  then Taron the new guy
[3202.48 --> 3204.28]  was like oh those look
[3204.28 --> 3205.58]  pretty good he's like
[3205.58 --> 3206.48]  picking it up he's like
[3206.48 --> 3208.40]  oh can I uh can I try
[3208.40 --> 3209.82]  this I'm like yeah sure
[3209.82 --> 3210.90]  whatever because we
[3210.90 --> 3212.30]  got like our our pack
[3212.30 --> 3214.24]  was enough for uh for
[3214.24 --> 3215.34]  for everyone to like
[3215.34 --> 3216.94]  well not everyone it was
[3216.94 --> 3218.14]  enough for me to have
[3218.14 --> 3218.94]  enough to use for a
[3218.94 --> 3219.64]  month because they
[3219.64 --> 3220.86]  provide a handle with
[3220.86 --> 3221.98]  your first order and
[3221.98 --> 3223.42]  then four cartridges or
[3223.42 --> 3225.08]  four blades each month
[3225.08 --> 3225.90]  so that you can use a
[3225.90 --> 3226.82]  fresh one every week so
[3226.82 --> 3227.34]  you're getting a nice
[3227.34 --> 3228.52]  clean shave so I was
[3228.52 --> 3229.44]  like okay well I've got
[3229.44 --> 3230.84]  a one month supply I
[3230.84 --> 3231.44]  guess I could ask
[3231.44 --> 3232.24]  dollar shave club to
[3232.24 --> 3233.36]  send me a renewal
[3233.36 --> 3234.34]  sooner and then
[3234.34 --> 3234.94]  everyone else can
[3234.94 --> 3236.18]  kind of try try one
[3236.18 --> 3236.92]  head so we're not
[3236.92 --> 3238.14]  sharing shaving heads
[3238.14 --> 3238.50]  because that's
[3238.50 --> 3240.20]  disgusting so he took
[3240.20 --> 3241.32]  off with it so I
[3241.32 --> 3242.20]  don't have that either
[3242.20 --> 3243.08]  he's like he just
[3243.08 --> 3244.16]  completely absconded
[3244.16 --> 3244.94]  with it he's got the
[3244.94 --> 3247.34]  handle and the entire
[3247.34 --> 3249.16]  thing of six blade
[3249.16 --> 3250.84]  cartridges so I don't
[3250.84 --> 3251.64]  have anything to show
[3251.64 --> 3253.18]  you guys except the
[3253.18 --> 3254.94]  one wipe Charlie's so
[3254.94 --> 3256.36]  one wipe Charlie's are
[3256.36 --> 3257.68]  the uh are butt wipes
[3257.68 --> 3258.34]  for men they're
[3258.34 --> 3259.74]  peppermint scented they
[3259.74 --> 3260.96]  are moistened so that
[3260.96 --> 3262.38]  you do a good job you
[3262.38 --> 3263.72]  do have it here
[3263.72 --> 3265.70]  awesome how is it by
[3265.70 --> 3266.60]  the way I haven't
[3266.60 --> 3267.10]  tried it yet you
[3267.10 --> 3267.82]  haven't even tried it
[3267.82 --> 3269.48]  yet here I am all
[3269.48 --> 3270.66]  upset that everyone's
[3270.66 --> 3271.60]  stealing my things and
[3271.60 --> 3272.22]  they haven't even done
[3272.22 --> 3272.90]  it yet okay well there
[3272.90 --> 3274.40]  you go guys there's the
[3274.40 --> 3275.44]  see we've cleverly
[3275.44 --> 3276.48]  labeled this one's
[3276.48 --> 3277.54]  Linus's this one's
[3277.54 --> 3278.86]  Terran's and there's
[3278.86 --> 3280.04]  the nice high quality
[3280.04 --> 3281.10]  grippy metal handle
[3281.10 --> 3282.16]  that's included with the
[3282.16 --> 3283.28]  uh with the six blade
[3283.28 --> 3283.96]  version I'm gonna go
[3283.96 --> 3284.62]  ahead and bring up their
[3284.62 --> 3285.66]  website because I spent
[3285.66 --> 3288.76]  this entire uh I spent
[3288.76 --> 3289.86]  this entire thing
[3289.86 --> 3290.86]  complaining about
[3290.86 --> 3291.78]  everyone stealing the
[3291.78 --> 3292.48]  stuff because it looks
[3292.48 --> 3293.44]  so good and it turns
[3293.44 --> 3294.94]  out that only one of
[3294.94 --> 3295.82]  my employees is
[3295.82 --> 3297.76]  stealing everything so
[3297.76 --> 3298.80]  I'll go ahead and fire
[3298.80 --> 3300.24]  it up so the whole
[3300.24 --> 3301.30]  point of Dollar Shave
[3301.30 --> 3302.06]  Club since I haven't
[3302.06 --> 3302.86]  actually managed to
[3302.86 --> 3303.62]  talk about that a whole
[3303.62 --> 3304.82]  lot is that they have
[3304.82 --> 3306.28]  a warehouse where they
[3306.28 --> 3306.86]  ship to you
[3306.86 --> 3307.54]  founder of Dollar
[3307.54 --> 3308.20]  Shave Club doc
[3308.20 --> 3308.86]  sorry about that guys
[3308.86 --> 3310.24]  where they ship to you
[3310.24 --> 3312.52]  once a month four new
[3312.52 --> 3314.72]  razors for your handle
[3314.72 --> 3315.58]  that they provide to you
[3315.58 --> 3316.28]  on your first
[3316.28 --> 3317.92]  subscription they do it
[3317.92 --> 3319.30]  at a cost that is lower
[3319.30 --> 3320.62]  than buying them from
[3320.62 --> 3322.12]  the you know shopping
[3322.12 --> 3323.16]  center or wherever else
[3323.16 --> 3324.20]  you get them you can
[3324.20 --> 3325.86]  see that uh Mike here
[3325.86 --> 3327.86]  has put it so well our
[3327.86 --> 3329.02]  blades are you know
[3329.02 --> 3330.90]  bleeping great he's got
[3330.90 --> 3332.24]  a whole actually very
[3332.24 --> 3333.08]  funny commercial that
[3333.08 --> 3333.72]  you guys should definitely
[3333.72 --> 3334.68]  check out just if you
[3334.68 --> 3335.58]  search for Dollar Shave
[3335.58 --> 3336.34]  Club dot com on
[3336.34 --> 3337.42]  YouTube you guys can
[3337.42 --> 3339.36]  check that out and uh
[3339.36 --> 3341.90]  all of that they do for
[3341.90 --> 3342.68]  very very reasonable
[3342.68 --> 3343.74]  prices so the four blade
[3343.74 --> 3345.26]  one the one that Luke is
[3345.26 --> 3346.46]  actually using is only six
[3346.46 --> 3347.46]  dollars a month and that's
[3347.46 --> 3348.30]  with shipping and handling
[3348.30 --> 3349.88]  included in the US and the
[3349.88 --> 3351.26]  service is also available
[3351.26 --> 3353.22]  in Canada and Australia
[3353.22 --> 3354.52]  this is one of the most
[3354.52 --> 3356.70]  disjointed integrations I
[3356.70 --> 3357.52]  think that I've ever
[3357.52 --> 3358.70]  actually done but I really
[3358.70 --> 3359.60]  hope you guys get the
[3359.60 --> 3362.12]  point save time save money
[3362.12 --> 3363.90]  Dollar Shave Club check
[3363.90 --> 3364.98]  this out and this is really
[3364.98 --> 3367.14]  cool because I think this
[3367.14 --> 3368.56]  might be new because when I
[3368.56 --> 3369.54]  was first looking at them
[3369.54 --> 3370.78]  their Canadian prices I
[3370.78 --> 3372.92]  think were higher or like
[3372.92 --> 3373.84]  shipping and handling wasn't
[3373.84 --> 3374.94]  included but check this out
[3374.94 --> 3376.74]  this is the first time that
[3376.74 --> 3377.78]  I've seen a company that's
[3377.78 --> 3379.56]  US and Canada that has a
[3379.56 --> 3382.12]  very competitive pricing on
[3382.12 --> 3383.66]  their Canadian service with
[3383.66 --> 3384.74]  shipping included that's
[3384.74 --> 3387.36]  really cool it's 50 cents more
[3387.36 --> 3388.76]  expensive in Canadian
[3388.76 --> 3390.78]  dollars for the four blade
[3390.78 --> 3393.46]  razor versus in the US now
[3393.46 --> 3395.36]  when you factor in that the
[3395.36 --> 3397.80]  Canadian dollar is about 10%
[3397.80 --> 3398.82]  behind the US dollar I think
[3398.82 --> 3399.88]  it's like five to 10% right
[3399.88 --> 3400.66]  now I haven't looked at it in a
[3400.66 --> 3402.82]  couple weeks they're basically
[3402.82 --> 3403.70]  just doing a currency
[3403.70 --> 3405.10]  conversion when you factor in
[3405.10 --> 3405.98]  that shipping is so much more
[3405.98 --> 3407.50]  expensive in Canada that's
[3407.50 --> 3409.22]  freaking impressive and like a
[3409.22 --> 3410.46]  plus dollar shave club for
[3410.46 --> 3411.50]  doing that in fact I think the
[3411.50 --> 3412.70]  nine dollar and fifty cents
[3412.70 --> 3415.82]  executive one is less than the
[3415.82 --> 3417.34]  difference in currency more
[3417.34 --> 3419.10]  expensive because it's only 50
[3419.10 --> 3420.34]  cents more expensive as well so
[3420.34 --> 3422.30]  kudos to them for that all right
[3422.30 --> 3424.86]  so with our sponsor messages out
[3424.86 --> 3426.10]  of the way did I ever even
[3426.10 --> 3427.38]  actually switch to the dollar
[3427.38 --> 3428.38]  shave club there you go

[3448.58 --> 3451.02]  now we're pretty much done all right
[3451.02 --> 3453.30]  so let's move on to our next topic
[3453.30 --> 3457.14]  here which is the heart bleed bug this
[3457.14 --> 3460.02]  is a big problem I I was actually
[3460.02 --> 3461.88]  tempted to just do a dedicated video
[3461.88 --> 3464.34]  about this during the week not because
[3464.34 --> 3467.82]  I'm a total expert on you know SSL
[3467.82 --> 3470.94]  encryption and secure web access I have
[3470.94 --> 3473.10]  a basic fundamental understanding of
[3473.10 --> 3475.68]  how it works and why it's important to
[3475.68 --> 3477.36]  encrypt certain data that's sent over
[3477.36 --> 3478.74]  the internet so for example when you
[3478.74 --> 3480.88]  interface with a website like linus
[3480.88 --> 3483.54]  tech tips calm it's important for us to
[3483.54 --> 3485.88]  encrypt your username and password but it
[3485.88 --> 3488.16]  is not important for us to encrypt the
[3488.16 --> 3490.56]  post that you're about to post publicly
[3490.56 --> 3493.02]  so that's that's the that's the
[3493.02 --> 3494.52]  fundamental thing that's going on here
[3494.52 --> 3497.70]  SSL encryption exists to protect in
[3497.70 --> 3500.40]  flight private data as it's being
[3500.40 --> 3501.96]  transmitted so things like credit card
[3501.96 --> 3504.42]  numbers passwords and the like what the
[3504.42 --> 3507.60]  heart bleed bug is is it is a problem
[3507.60 --> 3511.14]  with up to an estimated two-thirds of
[3511.14 --> 3514.74]  the sites on the internet including some
[3514.74 --> 3517.86]  very frequently used very very big sites
[3517.86 --> 3521.22]  it is a bug that would allow stealing
[3521.22 --> 3523.38]  allow theft of the information that is
[3523.38 --> 3526.26]  being transmitted so there's all kinds
[3526.26 --> 3528.96]  of different things that use SSL so for
[3528.96 --> 3531.54]  example web email instant messaging and
[3531.54 --> 3534.66]  some VPN solutions are using SSL in
[3534.66 --> 3536.70]  order to secure your data and heart bleed
[3536.70 --> 3540.72]  calm was actually able to prove this this
[3540.72 --> 3542.64]  problem existed by stealing from
[3542.64 --> 3545.40]  themselves the secret keys used for their
[3545.40 --> 3548.58]  X 509 certificates usernames passwords
[3548.58 --> 3551.22]  instant messages emails and business
[3551.22 --> 3553.70]  critical documents and communication the
[3553.70 --> 3555.78]  bug has actually existed for around two
[3555.78 --> 3558.02]  years and assess a successful attack would
[3558.02 --> 3561.48]  leave no trace so if your VPN solution
[3561.48 --> 3563.58]  for example is has not done anything about
[3563.58 --> 3565.68]  heart bleed you might want to cool it on
[3565.68 --> 3568.08]  using it for the time being until they've
[3568.08 --> 3570.48]  proven that they have fixed any of the
[3570.48 --> 3572.40]  vulnerabilities because that is pretty
[3572.40 --> 3574.86]  much the only way to even know that you
[3574.86 --> 3578.16]  haven't been compromised is to just not
[3578.16 --> 3581.46]  transmit any any secure data over the
[3581.46 --> 3584.28]  internet in the meantime which is kind of
[3584.28 --> 3586.50]  terrible it's been a while since there's
[3586.50 --> 3590.22]  been something that that devastating all
[3590.22 --> 3592.20]  right let's move on to our next topic here
[3592.20 --> 3594.00]  this was originally posted on linus tech tips
[3594.00 --> 3597.16]  calm by Ashley thank you very much and that is
[3597.16 --> 3600.76]  that Netflix is now streaming in 4k starting
[3600.76 --> 3602.98]  with house of cards this is a bit of a
[3602.98 --> 3605.20]  mixed bag for me so here's the article on
[3605.20 --> 3606.70]  the verge I'm just gonna go ahead and
[3606.70 --> 3610.34]  flip back to back to me here this is my
[3610.34 --> 3612.52]  show this is a bit of a mixed bag for me
[3612.52 --> 3616.42]  because as much as I appreciate 4k content
[3616.42 --> 3620.44]  for some things I appreciate that when we
[3620.44 --> 3623.14]  are going to switch to 4k which we are for
[3623.14 --> 3625.72]  our videos it is going to enable a higher
[3625.72 --> 3628.06]  bitrate playback mode on YouTube that
[3628.06 --> 3630.16]  will allow even 1080p viewers to
[3630.16 --> 3632.32]  experience better quality I appreciate
[3632.32 --> 3634.90]  that I appreciate that as part of the
[3634.90 --> 3637.66]  4k production workflow we have the
[3637.66 --> 3640.84]  flexibility to take a 4k frame that's
[3640.84 --> 3643.90]  this big and punch in this small on it
[3643.90 --> 3647.62]  and get still a 1080p full HD image so we
[3647.62 --> 3650.08]  don't have to necessarily switch lenses if
[3650.08 --> 3651.70]  we want to get a close-up that's really
[3651.70 --> 3653.08]  cool right so we could just take a bigger
[3653.08 --> 3655.48]  image and then punch in in order to do
[3655.48 --> 3657.82]  really fantastic close-ups using a digital
[3657.82 --> 3660.76]  zoom I appreciate that about it but what
[3660.76 --> 3663.82]  I don't really much care for is the fact
[3663.82 --> 3665.38]  that it's going to have an impact on
[3665.38 --> 3667.84]  bandwidth for Netflix streaming users
[3667.84 --> 3669.64]  something that is a concern if you have a
[3669.64 --> 3671.26]  provider that limits your bandwidth I
[3671.26 --> 3674.80]  don't appreciate that it's already a
[3674.80 --> 3677.66]  concern for Netflix to be able to stream
[3677.66 --> 3679.60]  1080p with any reasonable level of
[3679.60 --> 3681.16]  quality like I don't know if you guys
[3681.16 --> 3683.20]  know this should be a topic for an
[3683.20 --> 3684.82]  upcoming fast as possible I don't know if
[3684.82 --> 3687.54]  you guys know the mechanisms behind it
[3687.54 --> 3691.30]  but there's more to the quality of a video
[3691.30 --> 3693.82]  stream than just resolution a lot more I
[3693.82 --> 3696.46]  mean I could I could give you guys a video
[3696.46 --> 3702.54]  stream that's just 1080 by 1920 black
[3702.54 --> 3705.58]  pixels that just refresh and that's not
[3705.58 --> 3708.34]  that's not quality that's that's just
[3708.34 --> 3710.42]  that's so just because something has a
[3710.42 --> 3711.80]  resolution doesn't mean it's a quality
[3711.80 --> 3714.44]  video feed so bitrate and color depth
[3714.44 --> 3717.02]  which is largely affected by the bit
[3717.02 --> 3719.60]  rate of the media actually to me has a
[3719.60 --> 3722.58]  very very noticeable impact on the
[3722.58 --> 3724.28]  viewing experience and when I'm watching
[3724.28 --> 3728.66]  videos on Netflix I just yeah it's
[3728.66 --> 3730.40]  really ugly sometimes the way that
[3730.40 --> 3733.14]  their dynamic throttling will scale back
[3733.14 --> 3734.42]  the bit rate so that you get these
[3734.42 --> 3737.12]  blocky chunks of of low color depth and
[3737.12 --> 3739.82]  that's a 1080p already so if you were to
[3739.82 --> 3741.56]  tell me okay Linus I want you to give
[3741.56 --> 3744.68]  up some more color depth so that we can
[3744.68 --> 3746.12]  throw more resolution at you that you
[3746.12 --> 3747.98]  might not even appreciate from so far
[3747.98 --> 3754.22]  away from your TV I'd go and maybe sure
[3754.22 --> 3758.60]  no probably not so they're saying right
[3758.60 --> 3761.90]  now look guys don't expect a mass roll
[3761.90 --> 3763.58]  out of this right off the bat so they're
[3763.58 --> 3765.68]  realistic about it and okay and on top of
[3765.68 --> 3767.12]  all of this is that it's going to use
[3767.12 --> 3768.38]  more bandwidth and Netflix is already
[3768.38 --> 3770.06]  having trouble dealing with all the
[3770.06 --> 3772.28]  all the service providers to get their
[3772.28 --> 3774.92]  service you know actually provided to
[3774.92 --> 3777.02]  their customers at a reasonable degree
[3777.02 --> 3778.94]  of quality and that sentence didn't
[3778.94 --> 3780.06]  actually make any sense but I hope you
[3780.06 --> 3781.46]  guys get the point so they're saying
[3781.46 --> 3783.50]  don't expect a mass rollout and even by
[3783.50 --> 3785.48]  the end of the year the 4k selection
[3785.48 --> 3788.48]  will be very small but there you go
[3788.48 --> 3791.90]  they've got it so if you were to buy an
[3791.90 --> 3795.92]  inexpensive 4k TV from Seiki or check
[3795.92 --> 3797.30]  this out this is a review that's coming
[3797.30 --> 3797.60]  soon
[3797.60 --> 3801.86]  ah an inexpensive 4k monitor from the
[3801.86 --> 3804.26]  likes of Samsung so yes guys I have
[3804.26 --> 3807.62]  gotten myself the UD 590 from Samsung
[3807.62 --> 3810.44]  4k 28 inch TN monitor available for
[3810.44 --> 3815.12]  $700 holy balls then you would be able to
[3815.12 --> 3818.06]  map a pixel to every pixel and enjoy that
[3818.06 --> 3820.40]  content natively but I'm just not
[3820.40 --> 3822.50]  necessarily convinced especially from
[3822.50 --> 3824.36]  what I've seen of that monitor so far I
[3824.36 --> 3826.52]  did have one open at NCIX today that I
[3826.52 --> 3828.26]  was able to check out not convinced that
[3828.26 --> 3829.30]  it's really worth it
[3829.30 --> 3833.90]  all right DirectX 12 will double Xbox one
[3833.90 --> 3835.52]  performance so this was originally
[3835.52 --> 3837.32]  posted by top war gamer on the Linus
[3837.32 --> 3838.94]  Tech Tips forum thank you very much for
[3838.94 --> 3841.28]  posting that and the original article is
[3841.28 --> 3844.58]  from bgr.com so they have a game
[3844.58 --> 3846.92]  changing update that will double Xbox one
[3846.92 --> 3850.76]  performance now my problem with this is
[3850.76 --> 3852.68]  comes back to the whole Nvidia
[3852.68 --> 3855.50]  discussion earlier where it's are you
[3855.50 --> 3857.66]  really going to be providing double the
[3857.66 --> 3859.04]  performance or is it going to be like
[3859.04 --> 3860.90]  double the performance in one game that
[3860.90 --> 3862.58]  was already fairly well optimized anyway
[3862.58 --> 3864.50]  and it's not really going to make a
[3864.50 --> 3867.08]  difference to most people and other
[3867.08 --> 3868.34]  than that is it just going to be a
[3868.34 --> 3872.24]  marginal incremental improvement and and
[3872.24 --> 3874.64]  I don't know yet there's still a lot of
[3874.64 --> 3876.56]  room for Microsoft to improve things
[3876.56 --> 3879.08]  about the Xbox one but a lot of the
[3879.08 --> 3881.12]  benefits of DirectX 12 seem to have to
[3881.12 --> 3882.92]  do at least from what Microsoft said
[3882.92 --> 3884.18]  maybe they're keeping some of their
[3884.18 --> 3885.86]  cards close to their chest but a lot of
[3885.86 --> 3887.30]  the benefits seem to have to do with
[3887.30 --> 3889.70]  allowing more low-level programming for
[3889.70 --> 3892.58]  the GPU from the game makers but that's
[3892.58 --> 3893.90]  something that we've already had on
[3893.90 --> 3895.70]  consoles for quite some time and it's
[3895.70 --> 3897.74]  something that Sony could just as easily
[3897.74 --> 3899.42]  enable on their platform whether they're
[3899.42 --> 3904.40]  using DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 and from what I've heard like word on the street
[3904.40 --> 3906.26]  is that we're not that far away from
[3906.26 --> 3907.88]  bare metal on these consoles already
[3907.88 --> 3910.46]  anyway so that to me kind of goes okay
[3910.46 --> 3911.90]  well if we've unlocked a lot of the
[3911.90 --> 3913.34]  potential of the hardware is this just
[3913.34 --> 3916.76]  going to be software tomfoolery and and
[3916.76 --> 3918.98]  smoke and mirrors in order to try to get
[3918.98 --> 3920.66]  games to run at 1080p because that's one
[3920.66 --> 3923.48]  of the claims that they're making or is
[3923.48 --> 3926.00]  this a total game changer as you say and
[3926.00 --> 3928.46]  it remains to be seen this and also
[3928.46 --> 3930.50]  remains to be seen oh yeah I remember
[3930.50 --> 3931.72]  where I was going with this sorry guys
[3931.72 --> 3933.28]  again like my train of thoughts just like
[3933.28 --> 3935.08]  run away I haven't slept a lot this week
[3935.08 --> 3938.48]  right Microsoft still has a lot of room to
[3938.48 --> 3940.72]  improve things whether this update
[3940.72 --> 3942.58]  improves anything or not because their
[3942.58 --> 3944.92]  whole cloud-based compute thing where
[3944.92 --> 3946.90]  they can use that for physics effects or
[3946.90 --> 3949.46]  simulation stuff where it's not terribly
[3949.46 --> 3951.94]  important that you know the waves of the
[3951.94 --> 3953.92]  ocean react with the same split-second
[3953.92 --> 3956.28]  precision as an opponent so there's a lot
[3956.28 --> 3957.94]  of room for Xbox one to improve its
[3957.94 --> 3959.66]  performance I just don't know that this is
[3959.66 --> 3963.26]  going to be the difference between 50%
[3963.26 --> 3966.02]  performance and 100% performance but it
[3966.02 --> 3967.66]  will bring multi-core processing to the
[3967.66 --> 3971.06]  Xbox one something that you know I am
[3971.06 --> 3972.70]  kind of baffled that it didn't have in the
[3972.70 --> 3974.46]  first place but I mean you look at how
[3974.46 --> 3976.00]  long Microsoft's been working on direct
[3976.00 --> 3978.62]  x12 I guess they're just kind of waiting
[3978.62 --> 3980.30]  it out they're gonna wait till it's done
[3980.30 --> 3982.16]  they're gonna release it when it's actually
[3982.16 --> 3983.96]  ready so because I think they said what
[3983.96 --> 3985.22]  they've been working on it for four years
[3985.22 --> 3991.58]  now all right Seagate has announced a six
[3991.58 --> 3995.66]  terabyte hard drive it spins at 7200 RPM so
[3995.66 --> 3997.94]  this is not your this is not your you know
[3997.94 --> 4000.34]  grandpa's cheesy high-capacity hard drive
[4000.34 --> 4002.76]  that spins at lower RPMs in order to make
[4002.76 --> 4004.60]  it reliable enough to deliver that kind of
[4004.60 --> 4007.06]  capacity it speeds at 7200 RPM it's
[4007.06 --> 4009.34]  available in two three four five and six
[4009.34 --> 4012.10]  terabyte capacity points it has 128 megabytes of
[4012.10 --> 4014.86]  cache it can feature a 6 gigabyte per second interface
[4014.86 --> 4017.42]  and up to a SAS 12 gigabit per second
[4017.42 --> 4022.76]  interface it does not rely on being helium
[4022.76 --> 4027.04]  filled like Hitachi 6 terabyte drive and
[4027.04 --> 4028.60]  Seagate is using what they're calling
[4028.60 --> 4031.34]  their eighth generation perpendicular
[4031.34 --> 4033.76]  magnetic recording technology and what
[4033.76 --> 4036.94]  the register it has figured is five
[4036.94 --> 4042.88]  platters to achieve this milestone great I
[4042.88 --> 4045.64]  guess I mean it's gonna be really cool for
[4045.64 --> 4047.26]  people who want to have lots of storage I
[4047.26 --> 4049.90]  think that for quite a while it was
[4049.90 --> 4051.64]  stagnant to the point where I kind of
[4051.64 --> 4054.04]  went okay what is what is the upgrade path
[4054.04 --> 4057.46]  for someone who has a dual bay NAS because
[4057.46 --> 4059.56]  we've only gone from like one terabyte to
[4059.56 --> 4061.42]  three terabytes in the last little while and
[4061.42 --> 4064.12]  like it's gotten to the point now where you
[4064.12 --> 4065.92]  don't look at that and go okay that's triple the
[4065.92 --> 4068.02]  capacity you look at that and go like oh
[4068.02 --> 4070.18]  that's only two terabytes more and I'm
[4070.18 --> 4071.92]  accumulating data at such a rate that it's
[4071.92 --> 4074.08]  not necessarily enough I mean to me this
[4074.08 --> 4076.66]  is exciting because it is a legitimate
[4076.66 --> 4079.00]  upgrade for someone who bought sweet spot
[4079.00 --> 4081.52]  you know two terabyte drives quite some
[4081.52 --> 4083.22]  time ago where now they can triple their
[4083.22 --> 4085.42]  capacity and that means adding a full eight
[4085.42 --> 4088.78]  more terabytes of storage to their setup but
[4088.78 --> 4090.76]  other than that I got him no I guess it's
[4090.76 --> 4093.44]  another hard drive it's gonna support you
[4093.44 --> 4098.96]  know encryption it's it's oh okay what's
[4098.96 --> 4100.40]  cool is they are gonna have one available
[4100.40 --> 4102.86]  right off the hop that is rated for 24 7
[4102.86 --> 4105.56]  operation and some ludicrous number of
[4105.56 --> 4106.94]  rights per year I think it was something
[4106.94 --> 4110.24]  like 500 hold on I don't want to I don't
[4110.24 --> 4111.44]  want to quote this wrong because I've made
[4111.44 --> 4114.14]  up enough things on the show 550 terabytes
[4114.14 --> 4117.86]  per year so that's enterprise class types of
[4117.86 --> 4119.36]  workloads right there so that's that's
[4119.36 --> 4121.34]  exciting I guess but those drives will
[4121.34 --> 4123.08]  continue to be more expensive than most
[4123.08 --> 4125.18]  consumers will be willing to spend I
[4125.18 --> 4127.28]  guess for me it's just I guess it's a
[4127.28 --> 4129.14]  shot in the arm for mechanical storage
[4129.14 --> 4130.40]  because especially now that we're
[4130.40 --> 4132.62]  getting one terabyte SSDs in that
[4132.62 --> 4137.10]  dangerous $500 price range it's starting
[4137.10 --> 4139.34]  to look pretty tough to justify a hard
[4139.34 --> 4141.02]  drive as your boot drive if you're
[4141.02 --> 4143.60]  someone who's you know buying a
[4143.60 --> 4145.70]  reasonably high-performance computer now
[4145.70 --> 4147.68]  our next topic this was originally posted
[4147.68 --> 4149.36]  on the forum by QWERTY warrior thank you
[4149.36 --> 4150.92]  very much in the original article is from
[4150.92 --> 4155.42]  next power up beta is project aura some
[4155.42 --> 4160.10]  more details emerge project aura has
[4160.10 --> 4164.18]  received a module developer kit 1.0
[4164.18 --> 4166.94]  release that has outed some of the
[4166.94 --> 4168.38]  guidelines so it does a couple of things
[4168.38 --> 4171.56]  here is it shows off what we can expect a
[4171.56 --> 4174.16]  project aura smartphone to look like so
[4174.16 --> 4175.76]  we've got a side view where they show what
[4175.76 --> 4178.10]  the screen and in this case looks like
[4178.10 --> 4180.50]  speaker and front camera module look
[4180.50 --> 4182.60]  like and how it will be sandwiched
[4182.60 --> 4185.24]  sandwiched with the rear modules which
[4185.24 --> 4188.78]  can be sizes like this so 1 by 2 2 by 2 or
[4188.78 --> 4190.94]  1 by 1 which will contain things like
[4190.94 --> 4193.94]  processors batteries and all kinds of
[4193.94 --> 4196.38]  cool stuff like that and more importantly
[4196.38 --> 4202.00]  than anything else this MDK 1.0 news
[4202.00 --> 4206.14]  reveals that an aura phone if you have a
[4206.14 --> 4207.88]  couple of batteries on it will actually
[4207.88 --> 4210.76]  be capable of staying powered on not
[4210.76 --> 4212.52]  only while you swap a battery like right
[4212.52 --> 4214.76]  now that's the phone feature to have and
[4214.76 --> 4217.04]  that's like why Samsung keeps building
[4217.04 --> 4219.94]  plastic phones is a user replaceable
[4219.94 --> 4221.62]  battery so that if you run out you could
[4221.62 --> 4223.88]  switch it out well project aura phones I
[4223.88 --> 4225.64]  should probably stop calling it project
[4225.64 --> 4228.34]  aura so while an aura phone will allow you to
[4228.34 --> 4232.60]  hot swap a battery so you will actually
[4232.60 --> 4235.12]  be able to leave the phone on while you
[4235.12 --> 4236.80]  replace your battery with something else
[4236.80 --> 4238.84]  or or like if you got like a couple
[4238.84 --> 4240.22]  batteries on you just like yeah I'll pop
[4240.22 --> 4242.20]  this one off and put a replacement on
[4242.20 --> 4243.28]  there run off this one in the meantime
[4243.28 --> 4245.86]  that is really really cool there are
[4245.86 --> 4247.18]  some more guidelines so they're saying
[4247.18 --> 4248.80]  that the module should have a smooth
[4248.80 --> 4251.10]  flat pebble form and they are saying
[4251.10 --> 4252.46]  that we can expect to see three different
[4252.46 --> 4255.46]  form factors mini medium and large which
[4255.46 --> 4256.72]  will presumably be some kind of a
[4256.72 --> 4260.02]  phablet and is coming later after mini
[4260.02 --> 4264.52]  and medium size our next topic and this
[4264.52 --> 4265.98]  will actually be our last topic this has
[4265.98 --> 4267.82]  been a fairly concise show I've gotten
[4267.82 --> 4269.32]  through everything that I really had
[4269.32 --> 4271.54]  planned fairly quickly here this was
[4271.54 --> 4273.64]  posted by Alex goes high on the forum
[4273.64 --> 4275.32]  the original articles from the verge and
[4275.32 --> 4278.80]  Google will for one day let anyone in
[4278.80 --> 4282.16]  the US buy glass it will come with a free
[4282.16 --> 4284.98]  shade in addition to the Google glass
[4284.98 --> 4288.28]  glass itself and it will be available for
[4288.28 --> 4292.78]  we are look Google is about to make okay I
[4292.78 --> 4295.54]  don't see any confirmation here includes
[4295.54 --> 4297.74]  of the Explorer program expansion on April 15th
[4297.74 --> 4300.36]  yeah there we go so it will include a free
[4300.36 --> 4302.78]  frame or shade with the purchase and it
[4302.78 --> 4304.86]  will cost fifteen hundred dollars just
[4304.86 --> 4306.68]  like it has for everyone who's joined the
[4306.68 --> 4308.82]  Explorer program now I actually bought a
[4308.82 --> 4312.32]  Google glass not that long ago and so if
[4312.32 --> 4314.28]  there's anyone in Canada or outside of the
[4314.28 --> 4316.88]  US who wants to buy mine off me because
[4316.88 --> 4318.82]  quite frankly I didn't end up using it
[4318.82 --> 4321.02]  pretty much at all it's extremely
[4321.02 --> 4322.88]  uncomfortable for me I'll be willing to
[4322.88 --> 4325.34]  sell mine for 1500 and I'll throw in I
[4325.34 --> 4328.10]  have I have a clear lens and I have a
[4328.10 --> 4331.46]  shaded lens and it's in basically pristine
[4331.46 --> 4333.02]  condition I've hardly touched the thing so
[4333.02 --> 4336.02]  there you go Google I'm one-upping you by
[4336.02 --> 4338.52]  allowing someone anywhere in the world on
[4338.52 --> 4341.82]  on the 11th not the 15th to pay $1,500
[4341.82 --> 4344.76]  for a Google glass instead I'm just trying
[4344.76 --> 4346.62]  to recoup my my money on it because I
[4346.62 --> 4348.12]  just found it too uncomfortable to use a
[4348.12 --> 4350.04]  problem that a lot of people don't have
[4350.04 --> 4352.98]  but for me is a big issue is the way that
[4352.98 --> 4355.68]  it sits on your ears because my ears are
[4355.68 --> 4357.66]  not level on my head so when I hold my
[4357.66 --> 4360.06]  head up right my ears are wonky it's hard
[4360.06 --> 4361.68]  to tell unless I'm wearing glasses but all
[4361.68 --> 4363.60]  glasses sit on me like this and what
[4363.60 --> 4365.56]  happens with Google glass is that that
[4365.56 --> 4368.16]  puts the display way outside of where I can
[4368.16 --> 4370.32]  actually read the thing so I just I was
[4370.32 --> 4372.48]  gonna do a review on it but I was just
[4372.48 --> 4373.98]  like you know what screw it this is so
[4373.98 --> 4376.32]  uncomfortable it hurts after like half an
[4376.32 --> 4378.30]  hour I'm not finding it useful because I
[4378.30 --> 4380.64]  can't even see the thing so forget it and
[4380.64 --> 4382.90]  I intended to flip it like ages ago and
[4382.90 --> 4384.24]  then I never got around to it so this is
[4384.24 --> 4386.34]  as good an opportunity as any so I'll be
[4386.34 --> 4388.92]  doing that on the garage sale after WAN
[4388.92 --> 4393.00]  show here and I think wow I think that
[4393.00 --> 4395.58]  might be pretty much it I planned to have
[4395.58 --> 4399.66]  Luke join me to call into the show for you
[4399.66 --> 4403.14]  know PAX East first impressions or
[4403.14 --> 4406.82]  something like that but I haven't
[4406.82 --> 4410.30]  put it okay
[4410.30 --> 4414.12]  do do do do do do do do do please just be
[4414.12 --> 4417.58]  favoring oh okay so there's that no no I
[4417.58 --> 4419.34]  don't have a reply from Luke so it looks
[4419.34 --> 4421.52]  like he won't be joining us thank you guys
[4421.52 --> 4424.76]  very much for joining me on the show
[4424.76 --> 4426.74]  people are asking for a pebble steel
[4426.74 --> 4428.84]  review and twitch chat yes that's coming
[4428.84 --> 4431.96]  I ordered one still not here so that's
[4431.96 --> 4433.34]  gonna be part of my review that's for
[4433.34 --> 4436.74]  sure and or are they just asking for a
[4436.74 --> 4438.80]  pebble review I've done a pebble review
[4438.80 --> 4441.08]  my couple review has like 200,000 views
[4441.08 --> 4445.46]  you guys someone's like call Luke I won't
[4445.46 --> 4447.32]  be calling Luke he's roaming right now so
[4447.32 --> 4449.66]  that would be a that would be a big that'd be a
[4449.66 --> 4451.70]  big problem thank you very much guys for
[4451.70 --> 4455.06]  tuning in all 4100 of you I am always
[4455.06 --> 4458.16]  just so overwhelmed that so many of you
[4458.16 --> 4460.10]  give up your Friday afternoon or Friday
[4460.10 --> 4462.60]  evening to spend it with me and hear
[4462.60 --> 4465.14]  about the latest technology stay tuned
[4465.14 --> 4467.60]  for all the PAX East content that's
[4467.60 --> 4469.52]  coming this weekend so that is brought
[4469.52 --> 4472.94]  to you by Intel and Corsair and a huge
[4472.94 --> 4474.98]  thanks to Luke and Brandon for giving up
[4474.98 --> 4477.78]  their sleep and their weekend and in
[4477.78 --> 4479.88]  Luke's case his health he's actually
[4479.88 --> 4481.92]  sick and he's still doing the trip so
[4481.92 --> 4484.56]  like rock on brother huge thanks to them
[4484.56 --> 4486.00]  for bringing us a bunch of cool content
[4486.00 --> 4488.58]  from the show and I will see you guys
[4488.58 --> 4491.10]  next week on the WAN show same bat time
[4491.10 --> 4495.18]  same bat channel
[4495.18 --> 4497.44]  god
[4497.44 --> 4501.20]  of
[4503.34 --> 4504.80]  is
[4504.80 --> 4504.92]  you
