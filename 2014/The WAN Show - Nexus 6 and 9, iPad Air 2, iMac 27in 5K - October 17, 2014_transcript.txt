[0.00 --> 6.00]  You know the funny thing about the WAN show today is that we were supposed to start on time.
[6.00 --> 14.00]  In fact, I've been in here for over an hour doing my test call with our special guest today,
[14.00 --> 19.00]  doing my, I don't know, whatever else it is that I do to prepare for the show.
[19.00 --> 27.00]  But, you know, it's funny because it feels like sometimes the more ahead of schedule you are,
[27.00 --> 30.00]  the more time you'll waste thinking,
[30.00 --> 36.00]  Ah, it's okay, I got lots of time, no big deal, everything's fine,
[36.00 --> 38.00]  and then it's 4.30 and you're like,
[38.00 --> 44.00]  Oh yeah, I forgot to record the intro where I intro the topics of the show today,
[44.00 --> 49.00]  and I forgot to, oh, you know, actually check and make sure that your special guest Paul
[49.00 --> 52.00]  from Paul's Hardware, formerly Newegg TV,
[52.00 --> 59.00]  is actually using the microphone that he's actually going to use for the guest segment.
[59.00 --> 64.00]  Because right now, we just have a super-de-duper silent guest over there
[64.00 --> 70.00]  who has two microphones, one on his desk, and one on his face,
[70.00 --> 73.00]  and then actually another one on his table.
[73.00 --> 77.00]  He has many microphones, none of which appear to actually do anything for the moment.
[77.00 --> 83.00]  So, we're going to go through the super-de-duper special call-out topics today.
[83.00 --> 90.00]  First up is Apple's event, the so-called October 2014 event that happened yesterday,
[90.00 --> 96.00]  and included all the most amazing, unbelievable, magical, revolutionary technologies
[96.00 --> 97.00]  that you can possibly imagine.
[97.00 --> 101.00]  So basically, smaller, thinner, better battery life, more powerful,
[101.00 --> 103.00]  but basically the same stuff.
[103.00 --> 108.00]  Then, also, Google announces the Nexus's 6 and 9,
[108.00 --> 111.00]  which are... I'll let you guess.
[111.00 --> 113.00]  Which one's a phone and which one's a tablet?
[113.00 --> 117.00]  We don't know, because Nexus's are just... they're like this weird...
[117.00 --> 121.00]  I don't know, whatever, I've lost the word.
[121.00 --> 126.00]  The point is, we're getting a phone and a tablet, and they're going to be good.
[126.00 --> 130.00]  And, um, one thing that's kind of missing, particularly on the phone side,
[130.00 --> 136.00]  is usually with a Nexus device, it's all about the, sort of the cheap bang for the buck-ness,
[136.00 --> 138.00]  and that doesn't seem to be happening this time.
[138.00 --> 144.00]  Also in the news this week, Ubisoft just keeps on digging, don't they?
[144.00 --> 148.00]  A Redditor, actually, member of the PC Master Race subreddit,
[148.00 --> 152.00]  had a presentation at his school.
[152.00 --> 154.00]  And, uh...
[154.00 --> 159.00]  Wow, yeah, a couple of Ubisoft representatives there said some stuff
[159.00 --> 162.00]  that is going to light the internet on fire yet again.
[162.00 --> 165.00]  It's like Ubisoft wants to burn down the whole internet,
[165.00 --> 167.00]  and that's the objective here.
[167.00 --> 170.00]  Finally, Netflix raises prices on 4K streams.
[170.00 --> 172.00]  That was a bit of a cop-out topic.
[172.00 --> 175.00]  I actually didn't try that hard to find another one that was amazing,
[175.00 --> 178.00]  because we are going to have a lot to talk about this week, regardless.
[178.00 --> 183.00]  At least I'll talk, and Paul will listen, because I don't think he can talk yet.
[183.00 --> 185.00]  Paul, you got that working over there?
[187.00 --> 188.00]  Pfft!
[188.00 --> 190.00]  Let's just roll the intro.
[190.00 --> 215.00]  Ah yeah, we got sponsors today, guys!
[215.00 --> 216.00]  We got Squarespace.
[216.00 --> 222.10]  Squarespace.com slash Linus 10% off with the offer code Linus.
[224.12 --> 230.84]  Also, we got 5-4 Club back sponsoring this week's episode with a special offer.
[231.06 --> 233.50]  One that actually looks pretty darn compelling.
[234.00 --> 237.60]  Last time around, they were slipping cash into people's packages.
[237.92 --> 241.62]  The kind of thing that's normally only acceptable at certain establishments.
[241.62 --> 245.16]  This time around, they've got a whole other thing going on.
[245.16 --> 249.60]  And I'll give you the details about that later on in the show.
[249.96 --> 252.28]  So hopefully Paul is back with us.
[252.38 --> 253.22]  Paul, you good?
[253.82 --> 254.98]  I muted nothing.
[255.46 --> 256.40]  Oh, that's right.
[256.44 --> 257.62]  I did mute you, didn't I?
[257.78 --> 259.08]  Oh, there's our problem.
[259.22 --> 259.48]  All right.
[259.56 --> 264.08]  Well, let's open up the volume mixer and see if Paul is functioning over there.
[265.66 --> 267.52]  Can you hear me now?
[267.66 --> 268.88]  I can hear you now.
[268.94 --> 273.04]  Wow, it's amazing how changing the volume mixer works over there.
[273.04 --> 275.58]  So, Twitch chat, please feel free.
[275.68 --> 280.12]  Let me know if Paul is an appropriate volume because he's going to be with us pretty much
[280.12 --> 281.14]  for the rest of the show.
[281.26 --> 287.54]  I feel like I kind of owe him one after we kicked him off of the guest segment a few weeks
[287.54 --> 292.70]  back after pretty unceremoniously after like, what, six minutes or something like that?
[292.70 --> 297.18]  Well, I think I can understand from a viewer's perspective if it's affecting the quality of
[297.18 --> 297.68]  the stream.
[297.98 --> 302.14]  You gotta, you gotta, you know, sometimes you gotta make some sacrifices.
[302.62 --> 305.80]  Yeah, and I'm definitely gonna sacrifice you before me.
[305.94 --> 307.22]  So there's that.
[307.42 --> 311.52]  But note, note, you can see this week, no problem.
[311.74 --> 317.44]  So now we're gonna have Windows Task Manager replacing Paul instead of having Paul.
[317.44 --> 323.28]  We'll just have the Task Manager showing off how our CPU usage is now in the 35 to 60%
[323.28 --> 331.76]  range where last time we had Paul on, his presence was so powerful that he overloaded my system.
[332.10 --> 333.42]  Actually, I've upgraded it now, so.
[333.50 --> 334.92]  Well, Kyle was here too.
[335.10 --> 336.26]  He might have affected that.
[336.56 --> 340.04]  Well, we'll see what kind of effect Kyle has because he's going to be joining us in a
[340.04 --> 340.52]  little bit, correct?
[340.64 --> 341.04]  That's true.
[341.22 --> 343.92]  Yes, he should be appearing at my door at any moment.
[344.04 --> 346.38]  So I'll have to jump up and get him really quick.
[346.38 --> 349.34]  Um, he said he was on his way, maybe 10 minutes, so.
[349.58 --> 349.94]  Fantastic.
[350.34 --> 354.16]  All right, well, why don't we jump right into our first topic here today then?
[354.28 --> 354.96]  Oh, you know what?
[354.98 --> 355.70]  I just realized.
[355.84 --> 359.02]  I'm not sure if they're going to be able to hear you when I switch to screen sharing
[359.02 --> 360.86]  on my computer here, but, uh.
[360.92 --> 361.12]  We'll do.
[361.40 --> 362.32]  We'll do our best with it.
[362.54 --> 368.24]  So this was originally posted on the forum by Lord Kitty and the source is a, uh, a Reddit
[368.24 --> 371.26]  post in the PC Master Race subreddit here.
[371.26 --> 372.98]  So I'm just going to go ahead.
[373.06 --> 381.44]  I'm going to add the, uh, the formerly of Newegg TV crew to, uh, when we discuss these
[381.44 --> 381.62]  things.
[381.66 --> 381.98]  There you go.
[382.00 --> 383.40]  I'll just chuck you guys up in the corner there.
[383.40 --> 389.82]  And basically there was a presentation at a member of the PC Master Race subreddit's
[389.82 --> 393.14]  school where some Ubisoft folks came in.
[393.20 --> 396.98]  In this case, it was a game architect, an online programmer, and an HR representative.
[397.54 --> 399.36]  And they gave this presentation.
[399.36 --> 402.26]  And then there was some time for open Q&A.
[402.26 --> 411.62]  And so, uh, this, uh, this Redditor started to source questions from the subreddit and started
[411.62 --> 414.98]  to ask some, well, you know, some of those questions that we've all got.
[415.06 --> 417.52]  Like, what's happening to 60 FPS?
[417.90 --> 420.02]  And why exactly is this happening?
[420.12 --> 426.14]  So when he asked about the industry moving away from 60 frames per second, the game architect
[426.14 --> 429.82]  blamed settling for 30 FPS on limitations.
[429.82 --> 436.34]  Which is, uh, not in line with that whole cinematic line that we've been getting from,
[436.34 --> 437.92]  you know, PR representatives.
[438.04 --> 438.70]  Is it, Paul?
[439.20 --> 440.90]  Not, not quite exactly.
[441.00 --> 446.26]  But I, I think the main, the, my first takeaway from this story is, is it's fantastic that
[446.26 --> 451.96]  Reddit has like fingers or tendrils spread out so, you know, so much that anywhere there
[451.96 --> 455.18]  happens to be a discussion like this going on, there's going to be somebody there like
[455.18 --> 456.40]  immediately posting it to Reddit.
[456.54 --> 458.34]  That's just, that's just good to know.
[458.34 --> 458.46]  Yeah.
[458.76 --> 461.78]  Because I, I think Reddit is a, is a force for good for the most part.
[462.24 --> 462.78]  For the most part.
[463.66 --> 466.20]  For the most, depends what, which subreddits you get.
[466.20 --> 466.84]  They're a force.
[467.06 --> 470.78]  I would call them chaotic neutral, but maybe leaning towards good.
[470.86 --> 471.82]  Definitely chaotic.
[472.64 --> 477.42]  Well, we're getting off topic here, but that depends on your view of mankind entirely, doesn't
[477.42 --> 477.60]  it?
[478.06 --> 478.32]  Okay.
[478.32 --> 479.54]  We'll, we'll, we'll come back to that.
[479.54 --> 485.10]  But the main, the main point here, I think is, is that there should never be a limitation
[485.10 --> 490.12]  on software simply as a result of one company feeling that they can either make more money
[490.12 --> 497.52]  for it from it or, or reduce a competing platform's ability to perform by comparison.
[497.52 --> 499.44]  And, and there's absolutely no reason for it.
[499.52 --> 504.78]  People, people do PC gaming because they know they can build a system and they can get performance
[504.78 --> 508.84]  that's in line with what, you know, the type of system that they build and the amount of
[508.84 --> 509.48]  money they invest.
[509.68 --> 515.84]  And a company artificially making a limitation just so people can't argue that, oh, well,
[515.84 --> 519.64]  on PC at least I can get 60 frames per second or 120 frames per second.
[519.64 --> 521.90]  And, um, it's just not right.
[521.90 --> 526.64]  Like, which brings us to sort of the next thing the game architect said, and that was
[526.64 --> 529.44]  that, um, sort of there, it was implied.
[529.80 --> 534.46]  And this is the other problem with Reddit sometimes is a Redditor and, and, you know,
[534.50 --> 536.80]  I love the anonymity of the internet as much as anyone.
[537.00 --> 538.96]  So I have a love hate relationship with it.
[539.20 --> 540.80]  A Redditor can be anyone.
[541.12 --> 545.94]  And so when they say that the guy at the presentation implied something, well, that's the interpretation
[545.94 --> 551.36]  of that particular person, unless there were, you know, 50 people in the audience that all
[551.36 --> 553.46]  100% agree that that's exactly what happened.
[553.58 --> 559.66]  But anyway, this post says that they implied that they're being pressured by the console
[559.66 --> 562.74]  makers to limit games to 30 FPS.
[563.38 --> 569.92]  And it was also, when asked about Watch Dogs, the programmer mentioned that just before they
[569.92 --> 573.98]  release a game, they have to send a copy to the console manufacturers who have the final
[573.98 --> 578.80]  say on what to keep and what to throw away before the game is made.
[579.56 --> 584.28]  Why should console manufacturers have any say in what does or does not go into the PC
[584.28 --> 585.18]  version of a game?
[585.40 --> 588.68]  Like, that's, that's, that's the problem right there.
[588.82 --> 593.84]  Like, they shouldn't have to green light what people can do on a, like, does, does Sony
[593.84 --> 598.00]  have to go and approve what can go in the Microsoft version of the game or vice versa?
[598.20 --> 599.18]  I don't think so.
[599.22 --> 600.42]  Now that would be a good one.
[600.42 --> 607.08]  It'd be an interesting conversation to, like, be a fly on the wall for it, probably.
[608.28 --> 610.98]  So, basically, basically that's it.
[611.04 --> 615.60]  And then the Redditor also posted that at the end of this whole conversation about the,
[615.66 --> 621.68]  you know, the negative response to locking Assassin's Creed Unity to 30 FPS, you know,
[621.70 --> 626.62]  he commented on the console limitations, the choice between graphical fidelity and smoothness,
[626.62 --> 633.12]  and also said, our eyes can't see past 24 FPS anyway, and then apparently gave a wink.
[633.24 --> 640.06]  So, I, I, I don't know what's going on at Ubisoft, but it really feels like they have a civil war
[640.06 --> 645.92]  over there right now between the people internally who feel like they should be building the best
[645.92 --> 651.10]  thing that they can, and the people internally, probably more along the bean counter lines,
[651.10 --> 656.72]  who feel they should do whatever is going to make them the best, most amount of money,
[656.82 --> 661.64]  whether that is through a partnership with a console maker, or whether that is through
[661.64 --> 667.56]  selling more copies of the console version and making sure that the console buyer is appeased,
[667.60 --> 670.76]  because that's an angle that I think a lot of people aren't considering.
[670.76 --> 674.82]  Everyone kind of goes, oh, well, they're in bed with Sony, and they're in bed with Microsoft
[674.82 --> 681.04]  to limit the PC version, and we saw that with Watch Dogs. Ubisoft can deny it all they want,
[681.12 --> 686.38]  but pretty much, we know that's what happened. But something that they're probably not considering
[686.38 --> 694.96]  is that console maker aside, the console gamer is not going to want to see, like,
[695.32 --> 701.50]  when there's, when there are subtle differences in image quality, you know how the console PC,
[701.50 --> 706.28]  you know, flame war comment thing that happens. Anytime any of this crap comes up,
[706.64 --> 710.30]  the console gamers are going to try to say, oh, well, it doesn't look that different.
[710.60 --> 716.02]  What if it did look that different? How would they feel about their purchase? How would they feel about
[716.02 --> 720.70]  buying more games for that console? Because not every console player is going to instantly turn
[720.70 --> 725.36]  into a PC gamer if they feel disenfranchised about console gaming.
[725.78 --> 730.22]  Well, it definitely makes the PC gaming argument a lot more compelling if that's the case,
[730.22 --> 735.02]  but I mean, the other thing about this most recent generation of consoles that came out
[735.02 --> 742.14]  is they are not nearly as overpowered compared to, like, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 when they came out.
[742.30 --> 747.80]  So that also, to me, says that whereas earlier versions of the consoles,
[747.98 --> 751.40]  they took a pretty big loss on selling the hardware every time,
[751.98 --> 756.86]  it is probably less of that because the hardware they're using in there is really not as expensive.
[756.86 --> 764.62]  So that also provides a more compelling reason to deter people from going into PC gaming and buying the consoles
[764.62 --> 770.22]  is because they're not, I mean, I can't say this for sure, but I would assume that they're not necessarily
[770.22 --> 773.38]  taking as much of a loss on the console hardware as they used to.
[773.72 --> 774.98]  No, no, definitely not.
[775.40 --> 779.64]  I've got another interesting point here that's kind of hidden in the notes on this topic,
[779.76 --> 781.94]  but I thought it was an interesting point of discussion.
[781.94 --> 789.86]  So, Assassin's Creed Unity is going to have 8 hours of DLC before the game is even close to release,
[790.26 --> 794.26]  bringing the total cost, if you want to go for, like, a Season's Pass pre-order,
[794.76 --> 802.50]  to $90 if you want to count all the content created before release as release content,
[802.62 --> 805.52]  even though you actually have to pay extra for some of it.
[805.52 --> 809.16]  And I think we should probably do a Twitter blitz on this,
[809.30 --> 815.42]  but do you think, given that a game was going to cost you $59.99,
[816.58 --> 817.50]  actually, you know what?
[817.64 --> 820.08]  We should go back and find some old games.
[820.18 --> 823.10]  What was the release price of StarCraft 1?
[823.30 --> 824.14]  Like, Paul, do you remember?
[825.14 --> 828.06]  StarCraft 1, I believe, was probably $40.
[828.06 --> 832.98]  That's when I think the most you could charge for a PC game,
[833.08 --> 834.60]  even a AAA title, was $40.
[835.80 --> 840.94]  It might have been as low as $30, but I'm going to go with $40.
[842.04 --> 846.86]  Because I seem to remember buying games like cartridge games back on SNES,
[847.34 --> 851.56]  like pretty old games for $50 and sometimes even more.
[851.70 --> 854.56]  Like, what did Final Fantasy VI cost at launch?
[854.56 --> 858.08]  $6 I didn't play, but $7 was $50, definitely.
[858.62 --> 866.16]  Okay, so if in 1994, so we're talking 20 years ago, I think was around the time Final Fantasy VI came out.
[866.50 --> 871.44]  If we're talking 20 years ago, something was $50, should it be $60 today?
[871.54 --> 873.08]  I mean, let's find an inflation calculator.
[873.22 --> 875.12]  Guys, I want you to start blitzing at me with this.
[875.48 --> 878.90]  Is $90 completely unreasonable?
[878.90 --> 884.88]  If you can get a slightly reduced experience for $60 when we factor in inflation.
[885.72 --> 891.96]  You think the increased price might be reasonable due to the better game fidelity, increased mechanics?
[892.66 --> 897.86]  Maybe not better game fidelity, because I think that opens up a whole can of worms.
[897.86 --> 905.16]  But I would say the increased cost of making a game and the increase in general inflation.
[905.28 --> 906.36]  You might need to go get that.
[906.58 --> 907.84]  Kyle's here. One second.
[908.40 --> 913.32]  All right, so I'm going to use an inflation calculator here.
[913.40 --> 916.86]  I'm going to go 1994, something that cost $50.
[917.84 --> 919.28]  And we're going to calculate it.
[919.28 --> 924.32]  So apparently, according to at least the Bank of Canada inflation calculator here,
[924.64 --> 928.30]  something that was $50 in 1994 should be $73.22.
[928.76 --> 932.96]  And then when we factor in how much more a game costs to make these days,
[933.18 --> 936.02]  is it unreasonable for them to ask for $90 for it?
[936.74 --> 938.94]  All right, let's start going to the Twitter boards here,
[939.00 --> 941.50]  because I'm very interested to hear what you guys have to say.
[942.76 --> 943.76]  What a warm welcome.
[944.98 --> 945.72]  Hey, everyone.
[946.32 --> 949.18]  You're actually not live right now.
[949.28 --> 952.56]  Kyle, but he has no headset on, so he doesn't know these things.
[952.98 --> 954.20]  All right, I'm trying to reload here.
[955.24 --> 957.40]  All right, Alan Hinkson says,
[957.50 --> 960.16]  That's the last straw. I'm boycotting you, PSoft.
[960.42 --> 964.28]  PC games should never be locked at 30 FPS, and $90 is ridiculous.
[965.04 --> 965.82]  Owen says,
[965.92 --> 969.50]  I paid $89.99 for Warcraft 3 in 2000,
[969.68 --> 972.20]  and some SNES games were $79.99.
[973.46 --> 973.90]  All right.
[973.90 --> 975.18]  Are you like special edition versions?
[975.62 --> 976.36]  Frank says,
[976.46 --> 978.94]  Yeah, I didn't think Warcraft 3 was that expensive.
[978.94 --> 982.72]  I think I paid $60 for it, but then I got like a French...
[982.72 --> 986.68]  I think it was the battle chest that had like all the versions together that they released.
[986.82 --> 994.12]  Yeah, but then if you treat an expansion pack like DLC, which it basically is,
[994.18 --> 996.14]  I mean, that's pretty much exactly the same concept,
[996.84 --> 1003.94]  then maybe $90 for a game and a couple expansion packs is equivalent to $90 plus a couple of DLCs.
[1003.94 --> 1004.96]  No? Maybe?
[1005.60 --> 1013.04]  But in the past, I think they would have gone the route with the game they release at launch is pretty much what they've worked on up till then,
[1013.16 --> 1015.66]  and then they work on like more stuff.
[1015.78 --> 1017.50]  So if this stuff's already available,
[1017.76 --> 1021.06]  then maybe it should have just been integrated into the game from the get-go,
[1021.44 --> 1025.62]  rather than trying to immediately have like an upsell for people.
[1025.62 --> 1029.46]  So if they kept it secret for you, then you would feel better about it?
[1029.54 --> 1035.62]  Like if they kind of like kept it on a thumb drive somewhere so that no one knew about it,
[1035.66 --> 1038.90]  and then brought it out two weeks after the game comes out, then it's okay?
[1039.26 --> 1039.40]  Yes.
[1039.40 --> 1041.24]  I mean, I don't really see the difference personally.
[1041.24 --> 1044.66]  I mean, you run a business.
[1044.84 --> 1046.98]  Do you tell everything about your business publicly?
[1047.28 --> 1051.32]  I mean, even though it is sort of an ignorance is bliss kind of thing,
[1051.58 --> 1053.18]  there is something to be said.
[1053.28 --> 1057.96]  If they hadn't talked about this and maybe had given it even two weeks or a month,
[1058.44 --> 1059.58]  then maybe they could have done it.
[1059.64 --> 1061.50]  But the reason they're probably talking about it now
[1061.50 --> 1066.56]  is because they want to have this stuff in time for the holiday season, Q4, all that good stuff.
[1066.72 --> 1067.82]  So that's basically it.
[1067.82 --> 1071.34]  They're just capitalizing on the hype train because, let's face it,
[1071.62 --> 1076.26]  more people are going to buy deluxe editions and extra DLC
[1076.26 --> 1082.34]  when the game is all over every internet banner everywhere and in everyone's face
[1082.34 --> 1087.28]  versus if they wait three to four weeks and try to get that $30 upsell at that point.
[1087.84 --> 1090.26]  So, yeah, I guess I see why they're doing it,
[1090.32 --> 1093.86]  but I can also see why it's kind of lame.
[1093.86 --> 1098.10]  I mean, hardware makers, we see this kind of thing all the time.
[1098.20 --> 1103.74]  It's not like NVIDIA is not already working on GTX 1080 and 1180.
[1104.38 --> 1105.98]  They're already working on them,
[1106.08 --> 1108.48]  but they're not going to tell us about all that crap now
[1108.48 --> 1110.36]  because they still want to sell us some 980s
[1110.36 --> 1113.22]  and they still want us to feel somewhat okay about buying 980s
[1113.22 --> 1115.60]  when there's something that much better coming down the pipe.
[1115.60 --> 1119.06]  So you think they could just be decent?
[1119.28 --> 1122.32]  It would be more decent of them to just not tell us then.
[1123.52 --> 1127.98]  I think people wouldn't be having this argument over whether or not
[1127.98 --> 1132.24]  it's a thing to be done for a large video game maker.
[1132.78 --> 1139.06]  I mean, Assassin's Creed is huge, so obviously it's extremely profitable.
[1139.06 --> 1143.72]  I think the point at which people start to get upset
[1143.72 --> 1146.56]  is the point at which they feel that the decision is being made
[1146.56 --> 1149.30]  much, much more for the monetary reasons
[1149.30 --> 1153.52]  than it is for giving gamers the best time they could have
[1153.52 --> 1155.74]  or the most amount of content that they could give them.
[1156.00 --> 1156.28]  Right.
[1156.82 --> 1159.56]  All right, let's go through some tweets here.
[1159.72 --> 1160.78]  Welcome to the show, Kyle.
[1161.40 --> 1161.78]  Thank you.
[1162.04 --> 1162.88]  Hello. Sorry I'm late.
[1163.68 --> 1164.16]  All right.
[1164.42 --> 1166.84]  We're getting some pretty good tweets from people here.
[1166.84 --> 1171.00]  Action 52 for the NES was $199.99 in 1991.
[1171.90 --> 1173.62]  Iron Hawk says it's all about the money.
[1173.72 --> 1176.28]  They're announcing the DLC for hyping the game even more.
[1176.36 --> 1176.78]  You know what?
[1176.82 --> 1181.32]  That's a very good point because something that works really well
[1181.32 --> 1184.64]  for selling more of something is just this.
[1185.28 --> 1186.32]  Just talking about it.
[1186.48 --> 1188.92]  Even us talking about this DLC right now
[1188.92 --> 1191.78]  is creating more exposure for Assassin's Creed Unity,
[1191.96 --> 1192.80]  for better or for worse.
[1193.28 --> 1195.30]  That's why we get that AC money, right?
[1195.72 --> 1196.26]  That's right.
[1196.26 --> 1198.64]  That's why I get so much money from Ubisoft
[1198.64 --> 1201.58]  for my digging references.
[1202.84 --> 1204.38]  They love me.
[1206.00 --> 1206.78]  Brad's Coolio.
[1206.92 --> 1208.98]  I find it funny that AAA titles are so expensive
[1208.98 --> 1211.78]  whereas indie games, actual good games, are so cheap.
[1211.86 --> 1213.06]  Okay, Brad's Coolio.
[1213.12 --> 1214.32]  I'm going to have to disagree with you.
[1214.54 --> 1216.26]  You can't generalize that way.
[1216.62 --> 1218.72]  There are AAA titles that aren't that expensive.
[1219.34 --> 1222.42]  Tomb Raider 2013 was on Midweek Madness
[1222.42 --> 1224.62]  for what was it, like $10 or something this week?
[1224.62 --> 1225.82]  It's a great game.
[1226.18 --> 1228.68]  Yes, it's a little bit older, but that's how life works.
[1228.74 --> 1232.58]  If you want to watch the latest movie,
[1232.74 --> 1233.70]  then you go to it in the theater.
[1233.94 --> 1235.90]  If you want to watch the oldest movie,
[1236.04 --> 1238.58]  then you find it in a value bin.
[1238.58 --> 1240.62]  That's how it works.
[1240.82 --> 1243.32]  And saying indie games are actual good games,
[1243.40 --> 1244.70]  yes, there are good indie games,
[1244.82 --> 1248.64]  but I think to say that every indie game is good is ridiculous.
[1249.04 --> 1250.54]  Or to generalize that they're good.
[1250.64 --> 1251.62]  There's a lot of terrible indie games, too.
[1251.86 --> 1254.74]  There's a lot of just horrible indie games.
[1254.74 --> 1257.72]  And if we count the indie games that get funded
[1257.72 --> 1260.44]  on services like Kickstarter and don't get made,
[1260.62 --> 1263.42]  then there's some really abysmal indie games.
[1263.94 --> 1269.08]  Those are actionable indie games, in my opinion.
[1269.36 --> 1271.58]  Apparently Tomb Raider was $3.99, so there you go.
[1271.66 --> 1273.80]  You can get Tomb Raider 2013 for $4.
[1274.24 --> 1275.14]  You should probably go buy it.
[1275.16 --> 1277.52]  Is that the one that came with the life-size Lara Craft doll?
[1278.60 --> 1278.98]  No.
[1279.38 --> 1280.00]  That's kind of creepy.
[1280.10 --> 1281.10]  Which one did you buy?
[1281.10 --> 1284.64]  Well, for $400, they better throw something.
[1284.96 --> 1285.74]  No, $4.
[1286.40 --> 1286.90]  Oh, $4.
[1288.18 --> 1290.40]  Why would you want a life-size Lara Croft?
[1290.48 --> 1291.62]  Okay, tell me something.
[1291.90 --> 1293.98]  We should probably do a straw poll here.
[1295.06 --> 1297.64]  Would you buy a life-size Lara Croft doll?
[1297.70 --> 1299.52]  No, it's not would you buy it.
[1299.76 --> 1302.22]  Because I have to assume that everyone on this stream
[1302.22 --> 1303.28]  would probably buy it.
[1303.28 --> 1305.10]  What I want to know is,
[1305.26 --> 1308.78]  would you prefer original Tomb Raider Lara Croft,
[1308.78 --> 1311.58]  Tomb Raider 2013 Lara Croft,
[1311.68 --> 1314.80]  or Angelina Jolie Lara Croft in the box?
[1315.32 --> 1317.34]  Could we get old-school Lara Croft
[1317.34 --> 1320.84]  with the graphics and detail of current-day Lara Croft?
[1320.84 --> 1321.82]  No, you have to pick one.
[1322.08 --> 1322.56]  Aw.
[1322.72 --> 1323.72]  Which Tomb Raider?
[1324.02 --> 1325.98]  Current-day Lara Croft, because she's a real woman.
[1327.68 --> 1329.06]  Excellent choice, Kyle.
[1329.52 --> 1330.86]  I agree.
[1331.34 --> 1332.28]  That's my reasoning.
[1332.28 --> 1336.46]  So Angelina Jolie Lara Croft is not a real woman?
[1336.46 --> 1338.60]  Oh, was that an option?
[1338.72 --> 1339.78]  Was Angelina Jolie an option?
[1339.88 --> 1340.08]  Yeah.
[1340.20 --> 1341.24]  You weren't even listening.
[1341.36 --> 1343.54]  All you heard was Lara Croft comes in the box,
[1343.64 --> 1344.98]  and you're like, boom, yeah.
[1345.44 --> 1348.38]  I didn't know this was such an open-topic question.
[1348.38 --> 1350.82]  I just feel like she'd be kind of high-maintenance.
[1352.40 --> 1356.40]  Wait, so if I pick the current-gen video game Lara Croft,
[1356.46 --> 1358.34]  does that mean I could control her just like in the game?
[1358.70 --> 1358.96]  No.
[1359.04 --> 1360.90]  Because I would have no control over Angelina.
[1360.90 --> 1363.38]  No, let's say they come with their respective personalities.
[1363.38 --> 1365.26]  What?
[1366.84 --> 1367.20]  Okay.
[1367.70 --> 1371.24]  I'd say current-gen Lara Croft,
[1371.38 --> 1373.26]  because she seems like a down-to-earth chick, you know?
[1373.36 --> 1375.98]  Is this really the topic of the straw poll that you're creating?
[1376.24 --> 1377.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1377.04 --> 1378.04]  It's just taking me a little while,
[1378.10 --> 1379.94]  because I'm not signed into Twitch chat for some reason.
[1380.12 --> 1381.02]  I'm not sure what's going on here.
[1381.12 --> 1381.46]  I see.
[1381.68 --> 1382.54]  Stop it, Twitch!
[1382.62 --> 1383.46]  What are you doing?
[1385.10 --> 1386.50]  Log me in, please.
[1386.60 --> 1387.30]  Thank you.
[1388.52 --> 1389.54]  Stop being broken.
[1390.26 --> 1391.72]  Would appreciate that very much.
[1391.72 --> 1394.36]  I think this is where you and I have to start dancing
[1394.36 --> 1397.76]  and just distract the viewers while Linus figures this out.
[1397.84 --> 1400.66]  That would actually be incredibly helpful right about now.
[1402.68 --> 1404.10]  Come on, do you have any props here?
[1404.38 --> 1404.68]  What can we do?
[1404.68 --> 1407.02]  No, I have a wine opener.
[1407.50 --> 1408.88]  Why are we talking about props?
[1409.00 --> 1410.56]  First we're talking about blow-up dolls,
[1410.68 --> 1411.88]  now we're talking about props.
[1412.20 --> 1413.44]  There's a C-clamp over there.
[1413.96 --> 1414.16]  Wait.
[1415.04 --> 1417.42]  I don't even want to know what you could do with a C-clamp.
[1418.20 --> 1418.46]  All right.
[1418.46 --> 1419.10]  I'm going to blow-up doll.
[1419.10 --> 1424.02]  So let's take a couple more tweets about this whole Ubisoft thing
[1424.02 --> 1427.44]  and then, wow, 46 new notifications.
[1427.74 --> 1431.26]  Man, you guys hit me so fast on Twitter these days.
[1431.68 --> 1433.34]  I don't think games should be restricted in any way.
[1433.88 --> 1434.82]  Where's Luke, by the way?
[1435.06 --> 1435.46]  What happened to Luke?
[1435.90 --> 1436.52]  Did he finally quit?
[1436.86 --> 1437.48]  You don't know where...
[1437.48 --> 1438.54]  Oh, well, you've been in Hawaii.
[1438.78 --> 1439.46]  Yeah, I've been in Hawaii.
[1439.58 --> 1440.92]  I've been out of touch with reality for the last week.
[1440.92 --> 1442.80]  He's not aware that Luke has been in Europe.
[1443.02 --> 1443.50]  He's in Europe.
[1443.64 --> 1444.04]  Oh, sweet.
[1444.34 --> 1447.00]  Luke has been in most of Europe from what I can tell.
[1447.00 --> 1447.66]  Just like Dimitri.
[1447.66 --> 1448.64]  Is he and Dimitri?
[1448.76 --> 1449.70]  Like, are they dating?
[1449.86 --> 1450.68]  They actually met.
[1450.84 --> 1451.08]  Oh, that's awesome.
[1451.08 --> 1453.76]  Because when you go to Europe and there's somebody else in Europe,
[1453.88 --> 1454.44]  you meet that person.
[1454.44 --> 1455.10]  You meet them in Europe.
[1455.22 --> 1455.92]  That's what you do.
[1455.98 --> 1457.86]  That is how Europe works.
[1457.98 --> 1461.68]  I think Daniel Hoff over there better be careful with ideas like that.
[1461.82 --> 1462.56]  He just tweeted,
[1462.72 --> 1465.18]  Imagine if Blizzard did DLC with WoW,
[1465.30 --> 1467.52]  where if you want access to a particular instance,
[1467.72 --> 1469.74]  you pay a small incremental amount for it.
[1470.38 --> 1470.60]  Wow.
[1470.60 --> 1474.74]  Well, they effectively have a much better deal going with a monthly subscription.
[1474.74 --> 1476.76]  That's true, but they could do both.
[1477.42 --> 1479.64]  I don't think people would go for that.
[1480.32 --> 1481.80]  But they don't have to.
[1481.96 --> 1483.42]  That's the thing about DLC,
[1483.86 --> 1485.78]  is that nobody has to buy it.
[1486.26 --> 1490.00]  Well, there's plenty of, like, frilly, you know,
[1491.28 --> 1493.98]  vanity items and stuff in WoW that you can buy,
[1494.06 --> 1495.50]  like, in the store and stuff like that.
[1495.64 --> 1496.70]  I never bought any of them,
[1496.76 --> 1499.12]  but I will say that my wife did from time to time.
[1499.54 --> 1500.46]  She got the Star Pony.
[1501.46 --> 1503.52]  Your wife is very vain, all those.
[1503.58 --> 1504.82]  Did you ever have a Star Pony, Kyle?
[1504.84 --> 1505.36]  Handy items.
[1505.54 --> 1506.56]  No, I never had a Star Pony.
[1507.02 --> 1508.68]  All right, what else we got for tweets here?
[1509.38 --> 1513.00]  Got people asking where they can buy a Gigabyte GTX 980.
[1513.24 --> 1513.78]  I don't know.
[1514.18 --> 1514.78]  On the internet.
[1517.20 --> 1518.14]  A Grave says,
[1518.22 --> 1520.60]  I think increasing the price of AAA titles is not ridiculous,
[1520.80 --> 1522.62]  but might start scaring off buyers.
[1522.62 --> 1524.76]  I mean, that's the thing that's scary here,
[1524.88 --> 1527.52]  is for all the vocal minority that's complaining about this,
[1527.52 --> 1530.16]  there's going to be lots of people who don't care,
[1530.36 --> 1532.48]  and then there's going to be the people who are actually buying it,
[1532.58 --> 1535.32]  and I guarantee you that if it was affecting sales
[1535.32 --> 1536.98]  in some kind of negative way,
[1537.04 --> 1539.62]  so if it was actually scaring off buyers, Mr. Graves,
[1539.90 --> 1542.20]  I guarantee you Ubisoft wouldn't be doing it.
[1542.86 --> 1543.54]  So there you go.
[1544.70 --> 1545.10]  Wow.
[1545.52 --> 1547.32]  Kimchi Mandu says,
[1547.44 --> 1548.76]  I don't mind the 30 FPS.
[1548.76 --> 1551.18]  I lock most of my games at 30 or 60,
[1551.36 --> 1552.40]  so I don't really mind.
[1552.40 --> 1555.20]  Not many PC gamers that do that.
[1556.44 --> 1557.66]  I sometimes do 60.
[1557.74 --> 1558.92]  It depends on the game, though.
[1560.52 --> 1560.92]  Really?
[1561.52 --> 1563.52]  That's one of the benefits of PC gaming,
[1563.60 --> 1565.50]  is that you don't have to conform to 30 FPS.
[1565.64 --> 1566.34]  You're not locked in.
[1566.40 --> 1569.42]  Yeah, I was doing adaptive V-Sync for a while
[1569.42 --> 1571.30]  on games that supported it.
[1571.46 --> 1572.92]  I didn't mind it.
[1573.02 --> 1574.30]  I thought it was a...
[1574.30 --> 1575.38]  I mean, when you have a monitor
[1575.38 --> 1577.20]  that can't do more than 60 hertz anyway,
[1577.46 --> 1579.42]  I felt like there wasn't much benefit
[1579.42 --> 1580.48]  to going beyond that.
[1580.48 --> 1583.32]  Here's a tweet from rsmith17.
[1583.86 --> 1585.18]  You aren't taking into account
[1585.18 --> 1587.96]  that games sell many more copies now
[1587.96 --> 1588.70]  than they did,
[1588.78 --> 1590.04]  and this offsets the inflation.
[1590.82 --> 1593.48]  Okay, you can make that argument,
[1593.76 --> 1595.24]  but the price of an item
[1595.24 --> 1599.24]  has never been dictated by the cost of it.
[1599.38 --> 1600.98]  The price of an item is dictated
[1600.98 --> 1602.66]  by what it's worth to the buyer,
[1602.66 --> 1604.54]  and then it kind of scales
[1604.54 --> 1607.06]  with the market from there.
[1607.06 --> 1612.52]  So if it was worth $60 or $50 or $80
[1612.52 --> 1614.46]  or some of these older games people are tweeting
[1614.46 --> 1615.14]  or even more,
[1615.20 --> 1617.20]  if it was worth that to the buyer then,
[1617.70 --> 1618.90]  then it's probably still worth
[1618.90 --> 1622.40]  that relative amount of income to the buyer now.
[1622.98 --> 1626.48]  So yeah, the fact that they're selling more copies of it
[1626.48 --> 1627.70]  means that they're going to make more money,
[1627.70 --> 1631.16]  but it doesn't mean that the cost...
[1631.16 --> 1633.08]  The value of it has gone down.
[1633.08 --> 1635.88]  Yeah, it doesn't mean the value goes down per user.
[1636.04 --> 1637.04]  It doesn't really work that way.
[1637.96 --> 1639.18]  I mean, they're businesses.
[1640.04 --> 1641.60]  They are trying to make money,
[1641.68 --> 1643.44]  whether we sort of like this or not.
[1643.48 --> 1644.04]  And you know what?
[1644.40 --> 1646.42]  Indie developers are businesses.
[1646.80 --> 1647.16]  They...
[1647.16 --> 1649.18]  If they make money,
[1649.26 --> 1649.90]  they're not going to be sad.
[1649.96 --> 1650.98]  You watch Indie Game the movie,
[1651.28 --> 1652.72]  you think the Super Meat Boy guy
[1652.72 --> 1655.60]  is like sad that his game sells lots of copies
[1655.60 --> 1657.60]  and he makes shed loads of money?
[1657.90 --> 1659.84]  I mean, yeah, they do it out of passion, sure,
[1659.96 --> 1661.66]  but that doesn't mean they don't want to make money
[1661.66 --> 1663.72]  and they're not going to try to make money.
[1664.08 --> 1664.80]  What about Notch?
[1665.82 --> 1666.42]  I'm sorry?
[1666.80 --> 1667.52]  What about Notch?
[1667.80 --> 1669.10]  What about Notch?
[1669.12 --> 1671.80]  He's made more money than like...
[1671.80 --> 1671.96]  I know.
[1671.96 --> 1674.24]  Probably everyone in the town I'm in combined.
[1674.60 --> 1676.64]  But he is also taking a step
[1676.64 --> 1679.52]  that will potentially make him a lot less money.
[1679.98 --> 1682.34]  Right, but he has lots of money already.
[1682.34 --> 1686.44]  So he's reached a point of moneyness
[1686.44 --> 1688.64]  where it doesn't really make a difference anymore.
[1689.12 --> 1690.50]  It kind of feels like that.
[1690.80 --> 1693.44]  All right, so why don't we move on to our next topic here,
[1693.54 --> 1695.68]  which is fast charging batteries
[1695.68 --> 1697.54]  with a 20-year lifetime.
[1697.74 --> 1699.96]  This was posted by Meechev on the forum
[1699.96 --> 1702.20]  and the original article is from engadget.com.
[1702.24 --> 1702.94]  I'm just going to go ahead
[1702.94 --> 1705.16]  and pop that up for you guys to enjoy.
[1705.80 --> 1708.70]  But this looks freaking promising.
[1708.70 --> 1712.56]  Apparently the technology is not super expensive to produce
[1712.56 --> 1714.34]  and we could be looking at batteries
[1714.34 --> 1716.62]  that can charge up to 70%
[1716.62 --> 1718.52]  and these would be new lithium-ion batteries
[1718.52 --> 1721.34]  up to 70% in two minutes.
[1722.50 --> 1723.34]  That's ridiculous.
[1723.90 --> 1724.80]  Yeah, I mean...
[1724.80 --> 1724.98]  Wow.
[1725.40 --> 1726.02]  I mean, okay.
[1726.24 --> 1728.12]  Here, question for you guys
[1728.12 --> 1729.76]  and you can debate amongst yourselves,
[1729.92 --> 1732.52]  but what's more important to you?
[1732.66 --> 1733.82]  Long battery life
[1733.82 --> 1735.10]  or fast charging
[1735.10 --> 1736.72]  with the same battery life we have today?
[1736.72 --> 1739.86]  I'll go for long battery life
[1739.86 --> 1742.62]  because I'm pretty good about plugging in my phone every night.
[1742.80 --> 1745.24]  If my phone can last all day with heavy use,
[1745.38 --> 1747.28]  then it's going to get a full charge every night.
[1747.48 --> 1749.64]  So yeah, that would be it for me.
[1749.78 --> 1750.92]  Fast charging is nice,
[1751.32 --> 1752.32]  but at the end of the day,
[1752.38 --> 1754.20]  you still need something to charge it with.
[1754.60 --> 1757.40]  I would prefer just having a self-contained battery
[1757.40 --> 1759.46]  that lasts as long as it does,
[1760.24 --> 1761.52]  regardless of where I am
[1761.52 --> 1763.52]  or if I have an AC power outlet near me.
[1763.78 --> 1765.72]  I guess it's a lifestyle thing too, though,
[1765.72 --> 1767.82]  because if you go to work
[1767.82 --> 1769.72]  where you have an outlet next to you,
[1769.78 --> 1770.78]  like you work at a desk,
[1771.08 --> 1772.62]  then fast charging is great.
[1772.70 --> 1774.10]  You just give it a zap whenever you need it.
[1774.16 --> 1775.52]  However, if you go to work
[1775.52 --> 1777.72]  where you're on the go all day
[1777.72 --> 1778.74]  and you're moving around
[1778.74 --> 1779.98]  and you're using your phone a lot,
[1780.06 --> 1781.78]  then I guess longer battery life is more useful.
[1781.96 --> 1783.12]  But either way,
[1783.52 --> 1786.10]  this will enable potentially devices
[1786.10 --> 1787.40]  with larger batteries
[1787.40 --> 1789.50]  to also be charged much more quickly.
[1789.50 --> 1790.90]  So if we had, you know,
[1790.98 --> 1794.34]  I usually assume when some research comes out
[1794.34 --> 1796.50]  and they talk about what percentage they can charge
[1796.50 --> 1799.14]  in X number of minutes for like a phone,
[1799.30 --> 1800.90]  I usually assume they're talking about an iPhone,
[1801.08 --> 1804.84]  so we can say somewhere in the 1800 to 2100 milliamp hour range.
[1805.24 --> 1806.68]  So if you had a tablet,
[1807.18 --> 1809.26]  let's say a 6,000 milliamp hour battery
[1809.26 --> 1810.42]  or 5,000,
[1810.46 --> 1811.80]  oh no, they don't go up to that high, do they?
[1811.90 --> 1812.28]  What are they?
[1812.32 --> 1814.16]  Usually like 4,000 to 6,000,
[1814.28 --> 1814.96]  somewhere in that range?
[1814.96 --> 1815.96]  I think 3 to 5.
[1816.14 --> 1816.60]  3 to 5?
[1816.60 --> 1817.22]  Is what I've seen, yeah.
[1817.26 --> 1817.78]  Okay, well, whatever.
[1817.90 --> 1820.52]  So the point is we could maybe charge that to 70%
[1820.52 --> 1824.32]  in 10 minutes or 5 minutes or 6 minutes
[1824.32 --> 1825.32]  or whatever the case may be.
[1825.48 --> 1827.12]  So pretty darn exciting.
[1827.24 --> 1829.82]  So they're using titanium dioxide nanotubes
[1829.82 --> 1831.88]  for the anode rather than graphite,
[1832.02 --> 1834.20]  which speeds up the battery's chemical reactions,
[1834.34 --> 1836.10]  offering 10,000 charging cycles
[1836.10 --> 1837.32]  rather than the usual 500.
[1837.82 --> 1839.00]  So would that be something
[1839.00 --> 1840.06]  that's more important to you
[1840.06 --> 1841.06]  than the fast charging?
[1841.24 --> 1842.44]  The fact that now you can get
[1842.44 --> 1844.14]  20 times longer life out of it,
[1844.14 --> 1845.80]  especially now that so many devices
[1845.80 --> 1848.16]  don't have removable batteries?
[1848.96 --> 1851.68]  When I first was looking at this story earlier,
[1851.92 --> 1853.90]  I was very excited initially
[1853.90 --> 1855.04]  because I'm always happy
[1855.04 --> 1857.12]  when I see battery technology improvements
[1857.12 --> 1858.36]  because I think that's just something
[1858.36 --> 1860.00]  that's lagged behind so badly.
[1860.68 --> 1863.02]  But my secondary reaction was,
[1863.50 --> 1865.16]  I hope it doesn't have
[1865.16 --> 1867.14]  like some sort of negative impact.
[1867.30 --> 1868.36]  You know, I hope each one of these
[1868.36 --> 1869.72]  that they create doesn't, you know,
[1869.90 --> 1872.08]  kill 10 baby seals or something like that.
[1872.08 --> 1877.76]  So yeah, that's a pretty big factor for me
[1877.76 --> 1880.70]  at this point when it goes into,
[1881.02 --> 1882.12]  especially for technology,
[1882.36 --> 1884.02]  is going to be the environmental impact
[1884.02 --> 1885.76]  it might have as well.
[1886.12 --> 1887.46]  So think of the children factor?
[1888.12 --> 1889.18]  Think of the children, yes.
[1889.24 --> 1889.80]  Think of the seals.
[1889.90 --> 1890.66]  Our future.
[1890.90 --> 1891.54]  But yeah, I mean,
[1891.64 --> 1893.24]  if you have something
[1893.24 --> 1895.76]  and it's going to last 10,000 charging cycles
[1895.76 --> 1896.38]  rather than 500,
[1896.52 --> 1897.60]  it should last a lot longer.
[1897.60 --> 1900.14]  Hopefully, maybe the device could last longer.
[1901.60 --> 1903.82]  I mean, another discussion is
[1903.82 --> 1906.52]  if we're reaching a point of capability
[1906.52 --> 1907.78]  with the technology and the speed
[1907.78 --> 1909.66]  where devices might start lasting longer
[1909.66 --> 1912.20]  rather than being replaced in one or two years.
[1913.20 --> 1913.50]  So yeah.
[1913.74 --> 1915.20]  Timing for this could be perfect then.
[1915.58 --> 1915.80]  Yeah.
[1915.80 --> 1918.66]  So you get a device that, you know,
[1918.72 --> 1921.38]  isn't really getting that much faster
[1921.38 --> 1922.16]  every generation,
[1922.16 --> 1923.18]  so you don't really feel the need
[1923.18 --> 1924.08]  to replace it so often.
[1924.32 --> 1925.16]  I mean, something like this
[1925.16 --> 1927.44]  could be great for your project Aura phone.
[1927.62 --> 1928.48]  So you could, you know,
[1928.52 --> 1930.98]  buy yourself a quick charge module
[1930.98 --> 1932.80]  versus the standard battery module
[1932.80 --> 1934.62]  and make that thing last freaking forever.
[1934.62 --> 1937.30]  I mean, once you have a portable device
[1937.30 --> 1938.38]  that can do, you know,
[1938.62 --> 1941.60]  say 4K resolution on a handheld display
[1941.60 --> 1943.82]  and have 48 hours of battery life
[1943.82 --> 1946.36]  and, you know, apart from gameplay,
[1946.68 --> 1948.20]  what really stressful thing
[1948.20 --> 1949.02]  do you do with the phone?
[1949.18 --> 1951.74]  So as long as it's not physically wearing out
[1951.74 --> 1953.30]  or bending,
[1953.50 --> 1955.20]  then it should be able to last
[1955.20 --> 1956.34]  a reasonable amount of time.
[1957.06 --> 1960.38]  Question for you is,
[1960.60 --> 1963.52]  do we really even need 4K on a mobile display?
[1963.52 --> 1966.00]  I mean, have you used the LG G3?
[1967.10 --> 1968.14]  No, I haven't.
[1968.48 --> 1970.32]  I don't really think so.
[1970.48 --> 1971.42]  I think it's overkill.
[1971.66 --> 1973.50]  I think the retina displays
[1973.50 --> 1974.30]  and the small devices
[1974.30 --> 1977.74]  are pretty absurd a lot of the time.
[1977.94 --> 1978.52]  I mean...
[1979.22 --> 1980.54]  It's a pixel race.
[1980.72 --> 1982.64]  It's a pixel race for smartphones, I feel,
[1982.82 --> 1985.32]  and I wish there was more of a pixel race
[1985.32 --> 1987.10]  for PC monitors
[1987.10 --> 1988.62]  because, you know,
[1988.66 --> 1990.06]  like the Nexus 6 is coming out
[1990.06 --> 1992.86]  and it's got a 2560 by 1440 screen
[1992.86 --> 1994.92]  and most people that have monitors
[1994.92 --> 1996.08]  are still running 1080,
[1996.36 --> 1996.86]  which is...
[1996.86 --> 1998.12]  I find that ridiculous
[1998.12 --> 1999.62]  that a 5.5-inch screen
[1999.62 --> 2000.72]  or a 6-inch screen, whatever,
[2001.04 --> 2001.82]  has a higher resolution
[2001.82 --> 2002.40]  than the monitor
[2002.40 --> 2003.84]  that you're using every day
[2003.84 --> 2005.46]  for work or for gaming and whatnot.
[2005.86 --> 2007.30]  When the funniest thing about it is,
[2007.50 --> 2008.34]  you know what?
[2008.52 --> 2010.02]  I've been using the iPhone 6
[2010.02 --> 2011.14]  for over a week now
[2011.14 --> 2013.56]  and it never occurred to me
[2013.56 --> 2014.58]  for even a second
[2014.58 --> 2016.70]  that the screen was low-res
[2016.70 --> 2019.18]  because it really, really doesn't matter.
[2019.60 --> 2020.90]  Like, relatively low-res.
[2021.00 --> 2022.42]  It's still retina or whatever,
[2022.58 --> 2024.24]  but it's not as high-res
[2024.24 --> 2025.08]  as the 1M8
[2025.08 --> 2026.70]  that I was using right before it.
[2026.80 --> 2027.24]  So, yeah,
[2027.32 --> 2028.46]  it's just funny you mention that.
[2028.60 --> 2030.20]  Not only can I not tell the difference
[2030.20 --> 2032.36]  between 1440p and 1080,
[2032.48 --> 2033.66]  but I couldn't even tell the difference
[2033.66 --> 2035.80]  stepping down to whatever this is
[2035.80 --> 2036.52]  because it's not 1080.
[2037.48 --> 2037.98]  Yeah, I mean,
[2038.02 --> 2038.72]  there's definitely something
[2038.72 --> 2040.30]  to be said for getting up to that point
[2040.30 --> 2042.30]  where, you know, 1080 and beyond
[2042.30 --> 2044.78]  because Steve's Windows phone
[2044.78 --> 2045.30]  that he has,
[2045.36 --> 2045.98]  he was showing to me
[2045.98 --> 2046.88]  and that was my first thing
[2046.88 --> 2047.44]  I noticed about it.
[2047.48 --> 2047.62]  I was like,
[2047.64 --> 2049.56]  oh, this has like an 800x600 display
[2049.56 --> 2050.14]  on it or something,
[2050.26 --> 2052.12]  which is why it cost like 60 bucks.
[2052.28 --> 2052.86]  But, yeah,
[2052.90 --> 2054.66]  I mean, once you get to a certain amount
[2054.66 --> 2055.30]  of pixel density,
[2055.42 --> 2057.48]  I think it really doesn't matter
[2057.48 --> 2058.46]  for a handheld device.
[2059.98 --> 2060.48]  All right,
[2060.52 --> 2062.16]  so speaking of handheld devices,
[2062.16 --> 2064.10]  why don't we jump into
[2064.10 --> 2066.28]  Android 5.0 Lollipop
[2066.28 --> 2067.38]  and the Nexus 9
[2067.38 --> 2068.48]  and the Nexus 6.
[2068.66 --> 2069.58]  So, guys,
[2069.74 --> 2071.26]  start hitting us on Twitter.
[2071.44 --> 2071.84]  So it's,
[2071.90 --> 2073.06]  oh, I can't really point
[2073.06 --> 2073.86]  over there very well.
[2074.04 --> 2074.46]  There we go.
[2074.78 --> 2075.76]  Linus Tech on Twitter.
[2076.02 --> 2076.70]  I want to start hearing
[2076.70 --> 2077.38]  from you guys
[2077.38 --> 2080.06]  about Android 5.0 Lollipop,
[2080.14 --> 2081.66]  Nexus 9 and Nexus 6.
[2081.76 --> 2082.88]  What are your thoughts?
[2082.94 --> 2084.10]  We will go through some of those,
[2084.34 --> 2084.90]  but first,
[2085.02 --> 2086.76]  let's sort of briefly run through
[2086.76 --> 2088.66]  exactly what's going on here.
[2088.88 --> 2089.16]  So,
[2089.70 --> 2091.10]  Android 5.0
[2091.10 --> 2092.58]  is coming in the next few months
[2092.58 --> 2093.50]  for the Nexus 5,
[2093.62 --> 2093.86]  7,
[2094.02 --> 2094.28]  10
[2094.28 --> 2095.92]  and Google Play Edition devices,
[2096.06 --> 2097.76]  as well as the upcoming 6 and 9.
[2097.96 --> 2099.62]  So we now have Nexus' 5,
[2099.74 --> 2099.98]  6,
[2100.10 --> 2100.50]  7,
[2100.50 --> 2101.58]  9,
[2101.82 --> 2102.18]  10.
[2102.54 --> 2102.80]  Hmm.
[2104.22 --> 2104.60]  Wow.
[2104.74 --> 2105.54]  All at the same time.
[2105.62 --> 2105.86]  Amazing.
[2105.92 --> 2106.54]  What happened to 8?
[2106.78 --> 2107.72]  That's all I've ever wanted
[2107.72 --> 2109.38]  was an 8-inch Google device.
[2109.66 --> 2109.94]  Yeah,
[2109.98 --> 2110.74]  it would be great.
[2110.84 --> 2111.58]  I would rate it
[2111.58 --> 2112.44]  8 out of 8,
[2112.58 --> 2112.80]  mate.
[2114.26 --> 2114.86]  Do you understand?
[2114.94 --> 2115.96]  I think my wife has one of those.
[2116.70 --> 2117.38]  All right,
[2117.38 --> 2118.92]  so the Nexus Player
[2118.92 --> 2119.92]  streaming media device
[2119.92 --> 2120.82]  is also getting it.
[2121.10 --> 2122.64]  Its biggest new feature
[2122.64 --> 2124.02]  is Material Design.
[2124.14 --> 2124.72]  It overhauls
[2124.72 --> 2126.06]  almost all of the GUI.
[2126.16 --> 2128.12]  This is the biggest Android change
[2128.12 --> 2130.06]  since Ice Cream Sandwich
[2130.06 --> 2131.44]  back in 2011.
[2131.86 --> 2133.40]  It has new refined animations,
[2133.62 --> 2134.46]  a new color palette,
[2134.60 --> 2135.56]  revamped multitasking,
[2135.70 --> 2136.42]  voice controls,
[2136.42 --> 2138.44]  and also brings
[2138.44 --> 2140.22]  5,000 new APIs
[2140.22 --> 2141.56]  for developers to tap into
[2141.56 --> 2142.60]  and lets multiple devices
[2142.60 --> 2143.76]  and various form factors
[2143.76 --> 2145.52]  work together better.
[2145.78 --> 2147.10]  There's improved syncing options,
[2147.24 --> 2148.14]  new notification settings
[2148.14 --> 2148.60]  and controls,
[2148.76 --> 2149.92]  improved battery saving,
[2150.26 --> 2150.98]  something that
[2150.98 --> 2153.22]  I would be really happy to see
[2153.22 --> 2155.30]  because being back on iOS again
[2155.30 --> 2156.58]  has actually been
[2156.58 --> 2158.02]  super duper nice
[2158.02 --> 2159.48]  because particularly
[2159.48 --> 2160.80]  when the phone is idle,
[2161.02 --> 2161.90]  the power management
[2161.90 --> 2164.66]  is just so much better.
[2164.66 --> 2166.44]  Multiple user accounts,
[2166.54 --> 2168.24]  something I guess
[2168.24 --> 2169.52]  we should have seen coming.
[2169.66 --> 2169.82]  I mean,
[2169.86 --> 2170.86]  as someone with a family,
[2170.98 --> 2171.66]  I'm not necessarily
[2171.66 --> 2172.68]  going to buy my 5-year-old
[2172.68 --> 2173.04]  a phone,
[2173.12 --> 2173.88]  but I also don't want him
[2173.88 --> 2176.46]  running amok on my OS
[2176.46 --> 2177.88]  doing all my things
[2177.88 --> 2179.48]  when it would be better
[2179.48 --> 2180.00]  if he just had
[2180.00 --> 2180.66]  his own playground.
[2181.34 --> 2182.46]  And some third parties
[2182.46 --> 2183.20]  have added stuff
[2183.20 --> 2183.98]  like this already.
[2184.20 --> 2184.74]  So we've got,
[2184.82 --> 2184.92]  you know,
[2184.96 --> 2186.18]  HTC has a kid mode
[2186.18 --> 2187.14]  if I recall correctly
[2187.14 --> 2188.56]  and I think Samsung
[2188.56 --> 2189.72]  does as well.
[2190.04 --> 2190.92]  So now you can get it
[2190.92 --> 2192.52]  without subjecting yourself
[2192.52 --> 2195.18]  to TouchWiz
[2195.18 --> 2195.94]  or using Sense.
[2197.06 --> 2198.24]  What else is there in here?
[2198.64 --> 2199.54]  Multiple user accounts.
[2200.22 --> 2200.58]  Yeah,
[2200.78 --> 2201.78]  so that's basically it.
[2201.84 --> 2202.58]  Now we can get into
[2202.58 --> 2203.58]  the hardware of the phone.
[2203.80 --> 2204.74]  So Paul,
[2204.86 --> 2206.04]  want to run us through
[2206.04 --> 2206.80]  the Nexus 6?
[2206.90 --> 2207.78]  Maybe give us your thoughts?
[2209.12 --> 2209.48]  Yeah,
[2209.62 --> 2210.82]  so this is something
[2210.82 --> 2211.70]  that we were discussing
[2211.70 --> 2212.06]  a little bit
[2212.06 --> 2213.18]  before the show started,
[2213.28 --> 2214.96]  but I'm looking
[2214.96 --> 2216.34]  for a new phone soon.
[2216.44 --> 2216.70]  Actually,
[2216.76 --> 2217.62]  I have a new contract
[2217.62 --> 2218.06]  starting,
[2218.20 --> 2218.76]  and when I saw
[2218.76 --> 2219.50]  the Nexus 6,
[2219.64 --> 2219.98]  I was,
[2220.12 --> 2220.28]  oh,
[2220.58 --> 2221.04]  sorry, Kyle.
[2221.14 --> 2221.44]  It's okay.
[2221.44 --> 2221.98]  There you go.
[2222.04 --> 2223.74]  I want to read it too.
[2223.90 --> 2225.02]  When I saw the Nexus 6,
[2225.24 --> 2226.00]  I was like,
[2226.06 --> 2226.24]  ooh,
[2226.38 --> 2227.00]  like I want to get
[2227.00 --> 2227.50]  a new phone.
[2227.62 --> 2228.80]  I don't care really
[2228.80 --> 2229.58]  which phone I get
[2229.58 --> 2230.12]  at this point,
[2230.22 --> 2231.04]  but I want it to be
[2231.04 --> 2231.70]  a new one.
[2233.16 --> 2234.00]  So it gave me
[2234.00 --> 2234.64]  some consideration,
[2234.84 --> 2235.06]  but yeah,
[2235.12 --> 2236.52]  5.96 inches,
[2236.74 --> 2239.62]  2560 by 1440 panel,
[2239.86 --> 2240.44]  which we were just
[2240.44 --> 2240.94]  talking about,
[2241.06 --> 2241.86]  not a huge difference,
[2241.94 --> 2242.24]  but hey,
[2242.96 --> 2244.06]  it's a nice screen,
[2244.14 --> 2244.48]  I'm sure,
[2244.60 --> 2245.80]  13 megapixel camera.
[2246.18 --> 2247.58]  I like the 4K recording.
[2248.74 --> 2250.14]  I've been using my phone
[2250.14 --> 2251.52]  at times to do
[2251.52 --> 2253.00]  random video recording
[2253.00 --> 2253.48]  here and there
[2253.48 --> 2254.04]  and being able
[2254.04 --> 2255.46]  to record at 4K.
[2255.70 --> 2256.64]  That's pretty nice.
[2257.24 --> 2258.24]  Two megapixel front
[2258.24 --> 2259.08]  facing camera
[2259.08 --> 2261.22]  for the selfies.
[2262.10 --> 2262.82]  I think it's got
[2262.82 --> 2263.80]  an f-stop of two
[2263.80 --> 2264.58]  as well.
[2265.14 --> 2265.32]  Oh, yeah?
[2265.32 --> 2265.76]  It's got a pretty
[2265.76 --> 2266.32]  wide aperture,
[2266.64 --> 2267.02]  which means,
[2267.08 --> 2267.74]  you know,
[2267.76 --> 2268.46]  you can get some
[2268.46 --> 2269.48]  good low lighting
[2269.48 --> 2270.84]  performance as well
[2270.84 --> 2271.36]  as that nice
[2271.36 --> 2272.34]  defocused background.
[2272.46 --> 2272.94]  Go for a more
[2272.94 --> 2273.62]  cinematic feel.
[2274.00 --> 2274.72]  More cinematic?
[2274.72 --> 2276.10]  Oh, you've got
[2276.10 --> 2276.68]  to be kidding me.
[2276.78 --> 2277.50]  So you're worried
[2277.50 --> 2278.54]  about bokeh effects
[2278.54 --> 2280.76]  on selfies, really?
[2280.82 --> 2281.06]  Of course.
[2282.34 --> 2283.02]  It's trending.
[2283.02 --> 2283.54]  I hate you guys.
[2283.54 --> 2284.54]  It's trending right now.
[2284.80 --> 2285.58]  What can I say?
[2285.62 --> 2285.88]  I mean,
[2285.92 --> 2286.98]  look at the filters
[2286.98 --> 2287.90]  that they have
[2287.90 --> 2289.72]  on Instagram.
[2290.00 --> 2290.16]  You know,
[2290.22 --> 2290.80]  that's one of the
[2290.80 --> 2291.34]  popular ones
[2291.34 --> 2291.74]  where they put
[2291.74 --> 2292.44]  the depth of field,
[2292.58 --> 2292.68]  you know,
[2292.74 --> 2293.92]  you blur everything
[2293.92 --> 2294.82]  except the subject.
[2294.82 --> 2295.64]  Take your social media
[2295.64 --> 2296.36]  to the next level.
[2296.56 --> 2296.72]  Yes.
[2297.44 --> 2298.16]  I'm very excited
[2298.16 --> 2298.56]  about that.
[2298.70 --> 2298.96]  Indulge.
[2299.36 --> 2299.70]  32,
[2299.88 --> 2300.10]  all right,
[2300.10 --> 2302.70]  3220 mAh battery
[2302.70 --> 2303.44]  is something
[2303.44 --> 2304.10]  that's,
[2304.18 --> 2304.92]  yeah,
[2305.06 --> 2305.28]  whatever,
[2305.94 --> 2306.42]  that's been
[2306.42 --> 2306.88]  my biggest
[2306.88 --> 2307.46]  complaint recently.
[2307.60 --> 2309.26]  My phone battery
[2309.26 --> 2310.16]  is really,
[2310.30 --> 2311.12]  really sucking lately
[2311.12 --> 2311.82]  in the last
[2311.82 --> 2313.12]  six months
[2313.12 --> 2313.92]  of its existence.
[2315.26 --> 2315.74]  So,
[2315.78 --> 2316.12]  yeah,
[2316.16 --> 2316.82]  hopefully the larger
[2316.82 --> 2317.64]  battery combined
[2317.64 --> 2318.30]  with the
[2318.30 --> 2320.86]  lollipop features
[2320.86 --> 2321.88]  of particularly
[2321.88 --> 2322.62]  saving power
[2322.62 --> 2323.18]  when it's like
[2323.18 --> 2324.04]  right about
[2324.04 --> 2324.72]  to shut off.
[2325.10 --> 2325.74]  That's what I hate.
[2326.12 --> 2327.44]  My phone battery
[2327.44 --> 2327.96]  runs out
[2327.96 --> 2329.38]  and then I plug it in
[2329.38 --> 2330.14]  and then I have to
[2330.14 --> 2330.34]  like,
[2330.48 --> 2331.48]  like if I'm going to bed
[2331.48 --> 2332.32]  and I use my phone
[2332.32 --> 2332.88]  as an alarm
[2332.88 --> 2334.10]  and the battery dies
[2334.10 --> 2335.68]  and I go to plug it in,
[2335.88 --> 2336.40]  I have to like
[2336.40 --> 2337.30]  wait for five
[2337.30 --> 2338.44]  plus minutes
[2338.44 --> 2339.40]  to get enough charge
[2339.40 --> 2340.16]  to turn it on
[2340.16 --> 2340.84]  so that my alarm
[2340.84 --> 2341.32]  will go off.
[2341.46 --> 2342.56]  That's an annoyance
[2342.56 --> 2343.40]  that's happened to me
[2343.40 --> 2344.00]  several times.
[2344.00 --> 2344.42]  You know what's funny
[2344.42 --> 2344.88]  is,
[2345.18 --> 2346.02]  yeah,
[2346.12 --> 2346.32]  I mean,
[2346.38 --> 2348.38]  this looks like
[2348.38 --> 2350.28]  Google catching up
[2350.28 --> 2351.06]  to what other guys
[2351.06 --> 2351.66]  were already doing.
[2351.86 --> 2352.86]  Like Samsung had that
[2352.86 --> 2354.38]  high endurance mode
[2354.38 --> 2355.10]  or whatever they were
[2355.10 --> 2355.70]  calling it
[2355.70 --> 2356.38]  where your phone
[2356.38 --> 2357.32]  could last for like
[2357.32 --> 2358.38]  multiple days
[2358.38 --> 2359.70]  on a few percent charge
[2359.70 --> 2360.94]  because it just like
[2360.94 --> 2362.42]  didn't do basically anything.
[2362.54 --> 2363.02]  It was like
[2363.02 --> 2364.44]  two color display
[2364.44 --> 2365.42]  and all that kind of stuff
[2365.42 --> 2366.56]  and it's funny
[2366.56 --> 2367.04]  that you mentioned
[2367.04 --> 2367.46]  that problem
[2367.46 --> 2367.98]  with your phone
[2367.98 --> 2368.88]  because I don't know
[2368.88 --> 2369.82]  about other manufacturers
[2369.82 --> 2371.18]  but HTC actually
[2371.18 --> 2372.38]  reserves enough battery
[2372.38 --> 2374.46]  to wake itself up
[2374.46 --> 2375.78]  to have an alarm go off
[2375.78 --> 2376.40]  even if it dies
[2376.40 --> 2377.16]  in the middle of the night
[2377.16 --> 2378.60]  so you might want to
[2378.60 --> 2379.98]  find a manufacturer
[2379.98 --> 2381.58]  whose phone does that.
[2381.94 --> 2383.42]  I do love HTC phones
[2383.42 --> 2384.32]  or there have been
[2384.32 --> 2385.38]  many HTC phones
[2385.38 --> 2386.20]  that I've enjoyed
[2386.20 --> 2386.74]  in the past.
[2386.94 --> 2387.98]  My wife has the one
[2387.98 --> 2390.42]  and she's really enjoyed it
[2390.42 --> 2392.96]  and she uses it
[2392.96 --> 2393.96]  to play audiobooks.
[2394.52 --> 2394.80]  So,
[2395.06 --> 2397.68]  thoughts on the $649.99
[2397.68 --> 2399.72]  unlocked price point though?
[2400.40 --> 2401.42]  I was disappointed.
[2402.14 --> 2403.06]  That's deep.
[2403.30 --> 2403.52]  Yeah,
[2403.76 --> 2403.96]  so,
[2404.14 --> 2405.10]  I mean,
[2405.14 --> 2405.62]  it's too early
[2405.62 --> 2406.40]  to say now too
[2406.40 --> 2406.80]  but I mean,
[2406.84 --> 2407.92]  there was also a rumor
[2407.92 --> 2408.70]  the day,
[2408.88 --> 2409.64]  I think the day
[2409.64 --> 2411.66]  of the launch of these
[2411.66 --> 2412.20]  or when they,
[2412.30 --> 2412.48]  you know,
[2412.50 --> 2413.12]  when they first started
[2413.12 --> 2414.04]  discussing them publicly
[2414.04 --> 2416.84]  that I think AT&T
[2416.84 --> 2418.98]  had posted the pre-order
[2418.98 --> 2420.02]  or something accidentally
[2420.02 --> 2421.14]  for the Nexus 6
[2421.14 --> 2422.24]  and it was like
[2422.24 --> 2423.42]  $50 on contract
[2423.42 --> 2427.52]  and I'm starting to think
[2427.52 --> 2428.30]  like that might have been
[2428.30 --> 2429.04]  just a mistake
[2429.04 --> 2430.34]  and probably not actually
[2430.34 --> 2431.02]  going to be what
[2431.02 --> 2432.16]  they're going to charge for it
[2432.16 --> 2434.40]  because $650 with contract
[2434.40 --> 2436.14]  is still probably seems to me
[2436.14 --> 2437.44]  like a $100 to $200
[2437.44 --> 2439.14]  upfront investment
[2439.14 --> 2439.80]  they're going to ask
[2439.80 --> 2441.08]  especially when it's brand new.
[2441.08 --> 2443.46]  Yeah,
[2443.82 --> 2445.62]  I'm pretty disappointed.
[2445.82 --> 2445.92]  I mean,
[2446.00 --> 2446.64]  I don't know
[2446.64 --> 2447.90]  that this has been confirmed
[2447.90 --> 2448.42]  or anything
[2448.42 --> 2449.42]  but I would suspect
[2449.42 --> 2450.82]  based on the fact
[2450.82 --> 2451.94]  that there's not much
[2451.94 --> 2453.22]  actual spec difference now
[2453.22 --> 2454.10]  between the Nexus 5
[2454.10 --> 2454.88]  and the Nexus 6
[2454.88 --> 2455.96]  we're going to see
[2455.96 --> 2457.36]  those two devices coexist.
[2457.72 --> 2458.62]  In addition to that,
[2459.12 --> 2459.46]  I mean,
[2459.72 --> 2460.78]  even Apple
[2460.78 --> 2462.32]  has finally acknowledged
[2462.32 --> 2463.84]  that there isn't
[2463.84 --> 2465.62]  just one size fits all
[2465.62 --> 2466.68]  for phone
[2466.68 --> 2467.92]  physical sizes.
[2468.62 --> 2468.76]  So,
[2469.12 --> 2469.26]  for,
[2469.58 --> 2471.06]  when I first heard
[2471.06 --> 2472.06]  that the Nexus 6
[2472.06 --> 2472.80]  was going to be
[2472.80 --> 2474.38]  a 6-inch device
[2474.38 --> 2474.98]  or whatever it is,
[2475.02 --> 2475.98]  5.9 I think,
[2476.42 --> 2477.14]  when I first heard
[2477.14 --> 2477.70]  that it was going to be
[2477.70 --> 2479.08]  a 6-inch class device
[2479.08 --> 2479.84]  I kind of went,
[2479.96 --> 2480.52]  what are they,
[2480.64 --> 2480.96]  high?
[2481.34 --> 2481.62]  I mean,
[2481.68 --> 2481.86]  yeah,
[2481.94 --> 2483.38]  I know that the Note series
[2483.38 --> 2484.86]  does great
[2484.86 --> 2486.38]  and I know that Samsung
[2486.38 --> 2488.14]  basically created
[2488.14 --> 2489.26]  the hype around
[2489.26 --> 2490.68]  this phablet category
[2490.68 --> 2492.58]  that is doing incredibly well
[2492.58 --> 2493.68]  with even Apple
[2493.68 --> 2494.76]  jumping on board
[2494.76 --> 2496.90]  but for that to be
[2496.90 --> 2498.00]  their only device
[2498.00 --> 2498.56]  because that's what
[2498.56 --> 2499.44]  we've seen from Google
[2499.44 --> 2500.08]  in the past.
[2500.40 --> 2502.22]  There's the Nexus device
[2502.22 --> 2503.36]  and then there's
[2503.36 --> 2504.16]  Google Play editions
[2504.16 --> 2505.92]  of like other stuff
[2505.92 --> 2507.26]  but it looks,
[2507.38 --> 2508.88]  I think just for the first time
[2508.88 --> 2509.32]  we're going to get
[2509.32 --> 2509.96]  the Nexus 5
[2509.96 --> 2510.80]  to just kind of
[2510.80 --> 2511.56]  continue forever
[2511.56 --> 2512.72]  or at least for
[2512.72 --> 2513.72]  quite a while
[2513.72 --> 2514.96]  and then the Nexus 6
[2514.96 --> 2515.54]  is going to be
[2515.54 --> 2516.86]  in addition to that
[2516.86 --> 2518.42]  so I think the fact
[2518.42 --> 2519.56]  that it's priced higher
[2519.56 --> 2521.06]  makes more sense
[2521.06 --> 2521.52]  that way
[2521.52 --> 2522.38]  because if they're still
[2522.38 --> 2523.18]  going to offer
[2523.18 --> 2525.18]  a value option
[2525.18 --> 2525.90]  and the Nexus 5
[2525.90 --> 2527.32]  is still a great device
[2527.32 --> 2528.72]  then they don't have
[2528.72 --> 2529.36]  to worry so much
[2529.36 --> 2530.44]  about making the Nexus 6
[2530.44 --> 2531.48]  so competitively priced
[2531.48 --> 2532.52]  and I got to wonder
[2532.52 --> 2533.42]  if there's pressure
[2533.42 --> 2534.04]  on them
[2534.04 --> 2535.26]  from the handset makers
[2535.26 --> 2536.60]  because it was
[2536.60 --> 2537.26]  a few months ago
[2537.26 --> 2538.98]  but we saw a report
[2538.98 --> 2539.60]  that I think
[2539.60 --> 2540.66]  Apple and Samsung
[2540.66 --> 2541.60]  were the only
[2541.60 --> 2543.86]  profitable handset divisions
[2543.86 --> 2544.78]  within their respective
[2544.78 --> 2545.34]  companies
[2545.34 --> 2548.48]  so guys like HTC
[2548.48 --> 2549.80]  who are not doing
[2549.80 --> 2550.42]  very well
[2550.42 --> 2551.60]  LG's mobile division
[2551.60 --> 2552.32]  has been doing better
[2552.32 --> 2552.90]  but even then
[2552.90 --> 2553.74]  I still don't think
[2553.74 --> 2555.16]  it's like an exceptional
[2555.16 --> 2556.12]  money maker for them
[2556.12 --> 2557.52]  maybe Google
[2557.52 --> 2558.78]  jumping in
[2558.78 --> 2559.38]  and kind of going
[2559.38 --> 2560.58]  yay phone should be
[2560.58 --> 2561.42]  commodity cheap
[2561.42 --> 2562.48]  like super cheap
[2562.48 --> 2563.58]  was upsetting
[2563.58 --> 2564.12]  their partners
[2564.12 --> 2566.78]  I mean
[2566.78 --> 2568.50]  is it something
[2568.50 --> 2569.12]  where you think
[2569.12 --> 2570.16]  if they get enough
[2570.16 --> 2571.50]  investment in the platform
[2571.50 --> 2572.92]  that's similar
[2572.92 --> 2573.84]  to like how
[2573.84 --> 2575.14]  how consoles are sold
[2575.14 --> 2576.78]  that they might be able
[2576.78 --> 2578.58]  to provide more
[2578.58 --> 2579.06]  of an incentive
[2579.06 --> 2579.86]  to manufacturers
[2579.86 --> 2580.64]  to selling
[2580.64 --> 2582.28]  the devices for cheaper
[2582.28 --> 2583.64]  like could that be
[2583.64 --> 2585.58]  a business tactic
[2585.58 --> 2586.22]  that they could
[2586.22 --> 2587.90]  use to take on Apple
[2587.90 --> 2589.14]  and they're kind of
[2589.14 --> 2590.06]  what they then
[2590.06 --> 2590.98]  could position as
[2590.98 --> 2592.68]  like overpriced devices
[2592.68 --> 2593.74]  no I don't think so
[2593.74 --> 2594.30]  because
[2594.30 --> 2597.92]  it's in no one's
[2597.92 --> 2599.00]  on the business side
[2599.00 --> 2599.32]  of things
[2599.32 --> 2600.68]  it's in no one's
[2600.68 --> 2601.38]  best interest
[2601.38 --> 2603.22]  to lower the ASP
[2603.22 --> 2603.92]  of a category
[2603.92 --> 2605.32]  the only time
[2605.32 --> 2606.18]  you're going to lower
[2606.18 --> 2607.50]  your average sell price
[2607.50 --> 2609.18]  is to try to
[2609.18 --> 2610.34]  nickel and dime
[2610.34 --> 2610.92]  a competitor
[2610.92 --> 2612.08]  so for Google
[2612.08 --> 2613.12]  why do they care
[2613.12 --> 2614.38]  because they've already
[2614.38 --> 2616.14]  got the lion's share
[2616.14 --> 2617.02]  of the mobile market
[2617.02 --> 2618.10]  with Apple
[2618.10 --> 2618.70]  in a
[2618.70 --> 2619.70]  like decisively
[2619.70 --> 2620.64]  in second now
[2620.64 --> 2622.08]  and Microsoft
[2622.08 --> 2624.08]  just barely even a player
[2624.08 --> 2624.90]  and Blackberry
[2624.90 --> 2626.40]  barely
[2626.40 --> 2627.58]  than that
[2627.58 --> 2629.32]  so it's not like
[2629.32 --> 2630.02]  if they make
[2630.02 --> 2630.94]  high-end devices
[2630.94 --> 2631.34]  cheaper
[2631.34 --> 2632.16]  they're likely
[2632.16 --> 2633.06]  to sell more
[2633.06 --> 2634.16]  Android devices
[2634.16 --> 2634.78]  in general
[2634.78 --> 2636.04]  or gain more market share
[2636.04 --> 2636.94]  and the way Google
[2636.94 --> 2637.70]  is making their money
[2637.70 --> 2638.38]  is through
[2638.38 --> 2639.82]  the data mining
[2639.82 --> 2640.64]  that they're doing
[2640.64 --> 2641.54]  as well as
[2641.54 --> 2642.56]  through Google Play Store
[2642.56 --> 2643.02]  purchases
[2643.02 --> 2643.72]  which maybe
[2643.72 --> 2644.48]  they could buy
[2644.48 --> 2645.96]  slightly higher-end games
[2645.96 --> 2646.58]  for their phones
[2646.58 --> 2647.54]  but let's face it
[2647.54 --> 2648.14]  people who are going
[2648.14 --> 2648.80]  to buy a
[2648.80 --> 2649.86]  you know
[2649.86 --> 2651.38]  $49 device
[2651.38 --> 2652.68]  off of a Chinese website
[2652.68 --> 2654.16]  are probably not buying
[2654.16 --> 2655.84]  $9 apps anyway
[2655.84 --> 2657.18]  so that customer
[2657.18 --> 2658.86]  is of no benefit
[2658.86 --> 2659.68]  to Google
[2659.68 --> 2661.02]  if just because
[2661.02 --> 2661.24]  they
[2661.24 --> 2662.16]  there are no additional
[2662.16 --> 2662.88]  benefit to Google
[2662.88 --> 2663.44]  just because they have
[2663.44 --> 2664.34]  higher-end phone hardware
[2664.34 --> 2666.76]  Kyle
[2666.76 --> 2667.94]  I think
[2667.94 --> 2669.44]  so do you think
[2669.44 --> 2670.84]  because the Nexus 5
[2670.84 --> 2672.10]  was not anywhere near
[2672.10 --> 2673.36]  the retail price
[2673.36 --> 2674.46]  of the Nexus 6
[2674.46 --> 2675.10]  it's like $300
[2675.10 --> 2675.86]  isn't it
[2675.86 --> 2676.14]  yeah
[2676.14 --> 2676.74]  so
[2676.74 --> 2679.26]  if that's such a wide gap
[2679.26 --> 2680.50]  going from 5 to 6
[2680.50 --> 2681.28]  but the specs
[2681.28 --> 2682.36]  aren't really that much
[2682.36 --> 2682.68]  different
[2682.68 --> 2683.54]  are you assuming
[2683.54 --> 2684.02]  that Google
[2684.02 --> 2684.76]  is going to be releasing
[2684.76 --> 2685.80]  some kind of
[2685.80 --> 2686.94]  lower-end
[2686.94 --> 2687.80]  more affordable
[2687.80 --> 2689.22]  price point option
[2689.22 --> 2690.00]  in the future
[2690.00 --> 2690.44]  or is that
[2690.44 --> 2690.78]  do you think
[2690.78 --> 2691.50]  that's their strategy
[2691.50 --> 2693.38]  behind such a
[2693.38 --> 2694.16]  such a high price
[2694.16 --> 2695.16]  for the Nexus 6
[2695.16 --> 2696.00]  no I think it'll just
[2696.00 --> 2697.04]  still be the Nexus 5
[2697.04 --> 2697.70]  I think they're just
[2697.70 --> 2698.26]  not going to
[2698.26 --> 2698.88]  not going to have it
[2698.88 --> 2699.24]  go away
[2699.24 --> 2699.76]  or they're going to
[2699.76 --> 2700.56]  leave it for now
[2700.56 --> 2701.38]  and see how it goes
[2701.38 --> 2703.80]  let's go to Twitter
[2703.80 --> 2704.70]  because I kind of said
[2704.70 --> 2705.26]  that I would
[2705.26 --> 2706.52]  I would listen to people
[2706.52 --> 2707.56]  on Twitter about this
[2707.56 --> 2708.92]  so here we go
[2708.92 --> 2709.52]  Ernie
[2709.52 --> 2711.16]  considering Shield Tablet
[2711.16 --> 2712.30]  can you suggest comparable
[2712.30 --> 2713.06]  tablets in terms of
[2713.06 --> 2713.64]  value and features
[2713.64 --> 2714.36]  not really
[2714.36 --> 2715.32]  if you want the features
[2715.32 --> 2716.26]  a Shield Tablet has
[2716.26 --> 2716.94]  then you're kind of
[2716.94 --> 2717.92]  stuck with the Shield Tablet
[2717.92 --> 2719.78]  Irina says
[2719.78 --> 2720.32]  thinking of getting
[2720.32 --> 2720.80]  a new phone
[2720.80 --> 2721.80]  Nexus 6 is not
[2721.80 --> 2722.48]  going to be it
[2722.48 --> 2723.64]  because it's too expensive
[2723.64 --> 2725.36]  and too big
[2725.36 --> 2726.34]  Amir says
[2726.34 --> 2727.22]  it's too big
[2727.22 --> 2728.16]  max size for me
[2728.16 --> 2728.90]  is 5 inch
[2728.90 --> 2730.58]  lollipop tried too hard
[2730.58 --> 2731.48]  with material design
[2731.48 --> 2732.66]  it's overdone
[2732.66 --> 2733.54]  interesting
[2733.54 --> 2735.60]  Phantom Fish says
[2735.60 --> 2736.46]  I honestly think
[2736.46 --> 2737.60]  it looks similar to iOS
[2737.60 --> 2738.54]  bottom swipe up
[2738.54 --> 2739.02]  graphics
[2739.02 --> 2739.70]  respond to messages
[2739.70 --> 2740.36]  from Taskbar
[2740.36 --> 2740.72]  etc
[2740.72 --> 2741.82]  Micah
[2741.82 --> 2742.84]  I have a Nexus 7
[2742.84 --> 2744.10]  but I don't have a smartphone
[2744.10 --> 2745.26]  I think the Nexus 6
[2745.26 --> 2746.00]  is too big
[2746.00 --> 2746.72]  if I were to buy it
[2746.72 --> 2747.70]  I could just use the 7
[2747.70 --> 2749.12]  and that's a good point
[2749.12 --> 2750.86]  where the line is blurred
[2750.86 --> 2751.62]  I mean Google's
[2751.62 --> 2752.64]  last gen
[2752.64 --> 2754.06]  tablet device
[2754.06 --> 2755.62]  is now
[2755.62 --> 2757.68]  similar to the size
[2757.68 --> 2758.70]  of their current gen
[2758.70 --> 2759.80]  phone device
[2759.80 --> 2763.62]  oh yeah
[2763.62 --> 2764.16]  we should probably
[2764.16 --> 2764.88]  very briefly
[2764.88 --> 2765.52]  go through
[2765.52 --> 2766.64]  what the Nexus 9 is
[2766.64 --> 2767.72]  so it's 8.9 inch
[2767.72 --> 2770.54]  2048 by 1536 IPS display
[2770.54 --> 2772.68]  that's a 4 by 3 aspect ratio
[2772.68 --> 2773.34]  for those of you
[2773.34 --> 2774.44]  who didn't pick up on that
[2774.44 --> 2776.84]  so interesting
[2776.84 --> 2777.72]  acknowledging that
[2777.72 --> 2778.56]  Apple is right
[2778.56 --> 2779.24]  about that
[2779.24 --> 2780.04]  very interesting
[2780.04 --> 2782.10]  8 megapixel rear camera
[2782.10 --> 2784.16]  1.6 megapixel front camera
[2784.16 --> 2785.34]  dual front facing speakers
[2785.34 --> 2786.52]  Tegra K1
[2786.52 --> 2787.92]  assumed to be
[2787.92 --> 2789.76]  the 2.5 gigahertz dual core model
[2789.76 --> 2790.70]  though not confirmed
[2790.70 --> 2792.18]  64-bit processor
[2792.18 --> 2794.08]  with 16 or 32 gigs of storage
[2794.08 --> 2794.94]  aluminum construction
[2794.94 --> 2796.94]  and going to be made by HTC
[2796.94 --> 2798.26]  pricing looks a little bit
[2798.26 --> 2799.14]  more reasonable here
[2799.14 --> 2800.64]  $399 for 16 gig
[2800.64 --> 2803.02]  $479 for 32 gig
[2803.02 --> 2805.62]  and $599 for 32 gig with LTE
[2805.62 --> 2806.52]  but again
[2806.52 --> 2808.78]  not Nexus aggressive
[2808.78 --> 2810.36]  I mean that was the whole thing
[2810.36 --> 2811.56]  with the Nexus 7 is
[2811.56 --> 2812.88]  if I recall correctly
[2812.88 --> 2813.92]  that thing launched at what
[2813.92 --> 2815.22]  $199.99
[2815.22 --> 2817.02]  was the original Nexus 7 price
[2817.02 --> 2819.02]  generation 1
[2819.02 --> 2819.74]  I believe so
[2819.74 --> 2820.12]  yeah
[2820.12 --> 2821.60]  one of them might have been $250
[2821.60 --> 2823.26]  because that was the whole concept
[2823.26 --> 2824.80]  bringing the Google
[2824.80 --> 2825.90]  you know
[2825.90 --> 2827.82]  stock Android experience
[2827.82 --> 2828.92]  to the masses
[2828.92 --> 2829.74]  that was what made them
[2829.74 --> 2830.30]  so appealing
[2830.30 --> 2830.84]  well now
[2830.84 --> 2832.50]  yeah we get a couple more
[2832.50 --> 2832.98]  inches
[2832.98 --> 2834.68]  but is that really worth
[2834.68 --> 2835.78]  the couple hundred dollars
[2835.78 --> 2836.66]  extra we're paying
[2836.66 --> 2838.56]  hard to say
[2838.56 --> 2840.12]  Nexus 9 versus
[2840.12 --> 2841.02]  Shield tablet
[2841.02 --> 2841.82]  oh
[2841.82 --> 2842.98]  Shield tablet for sure
[2842.98 --> 2843.38]  for me
[2843.38 --> 2844.06]  if you're a gamer
[2844.06 --> 2844.92]  you gotta go for the
[2844.92 --> 2845.42]  Shield tablet
[2845.42 --> 2846.54]  it has the quad core
[2846.54 --> 2850.40]  it has the stylus
[2850.40 --> 2852.80]  build quality is not metal
[2852.80 --> 2853.38]  but solid
[2853.38 --> 2854.66]  and it has GameStream
[2854.66 --> 2856.14]  if you're gonna game on it at all
[2856.14 --> 2858.04]  then having GameStream
[2858.04 --> 2859.08]  from your GeForce PC
[2859.08 --> 2860.00]  is a pretty
[2860.00 --> 2861.02]  pretty good thing to have
[2861.02 --> 2864.80]  alright
[2864.80 --> 2865.92]  Jonah the boss
[2865.92 --> 2867.32]  the price is not reasonable
[2867.32 --> 2868.76]  got it
[2868.76 --> 2871.50]  Oliver says
[2871.50 --> 2873.30]  so is this Android silver
[2873.30 --> 2874.86]  but maybe they kept the Nexus name
[2874.86 --> 2876.08]  yeah there were rumors about
[2876.08 --> 2877.02]  Android silver
[2877.02 --> 2878.44]  maybe silver means
[2878.44 --> 2879.48]  not cheap anymore
[2879.48 --> 2880.96]  but basically the same thing
[2880.96 --> 2883.14]  Kim Chi
[2883.14 --> 2884.76]  loved Nexus for the low price point
[2884.76 --> 2885.66]  after I heard the price
[2885.66 --> 2886.48]  my heart sank
[2886.48 --> 2888.12]  down to the ground
[2888.12 --> 2889.68]  hmm
[2889.68 --> 2890.42]  Phantom Fish
[2890.42 --> 2892.02]  I think we saw this tweet before
[2892.02 --> 2895.12]  Nexus 5 is max size
[2895.12 --> 2896.06]  for my largest hands
[2896.06 --> 2897.78]  Nexus 6 is too big
[2897.78 --> 2902.74]  wow there's not a whole lot of positivity
[2902.74 --> 2904.08]  about this on Twitter here
[2904.08 --> 2904.58]  is there
[2904.58 --> 2906.66]  I think people were too
[2906.66 --> 2907.32]  like
[2907.32 --> 2910.14]  people enjoyed the price
[2910.14 --> 2911.82]  of the Nexus 5 so much
[2911.82 --> 2913.64]  like they were just really expecting
[2913.64 --> 2914.48]  oh they're gonna come out
[2914.48 --> 2915.22]  with another phone
[2915.22 --> 2916.24]  and it's gonna be available
[2916.24 --> 2917.36]  and I'm gonna be able to buy it
[2917.36 --> 2918.00]  with no contract
[2918.00 --> 2919.46]  for three or four hundred bucks
[2919.46 --> 2920.92]  of all the Nexus devices
[2920.92 --> 2921.30]  really
[2921.30 --> 2922.40]  I mean I bought my
[2922.40 --> 2923.86]  second generation Nexus 7
[2923.86 --> 2925.90]  for 220 bucks
[2925.90 --> 2927.36]  and it wasn't even on sale
[2927.36 --> 2929.00]  and if you think about it
[2929.00 --> 2930.06]  the Nexus 6 is
[2930.06 --> 2930.84]  is basically
[2930.84 --> 2931.60]  just like a Nexus
[2931.60 --> 2932.78]  Nexus 7
[2932.78 --> 2933.58]  except it's a phone
[2933.58 --> 2934.68]  and it's one inch smaller
[2934.68 --> 2936.36]  but people who are getting
[2936.36 --> 2937.06]  the Nexus 6
[2937.06 --> 2938.90]  will virtually have no reason
[2938.90 --> 2939.60]  at all to buy
[2939.60 --> 2941.02]  a Nexus 7 tablet
[2941.02 --> 2942.28]  especially when
[2942.28 --> 2944.08]  it's a third of the price
[2944.08 --> 2945.38]  if I recall correctly
[2945.38 --> 2945.74]  so
[2945.74 --> 2946.40]  so
[2946.40 --> 2947.78]  on the phone side
[2947.78 --> 2949.02]  we might keep Nexus 5
[2949.02 --> 2950.18]  around for quite a while
[2950.18 --> 2951.16]  but on the tablet side
[2951.16 --> 2951.86]  it looks like
[2951.86 --> 2952.82]  the entry level
[2952.82 --> 2953.78]  Nexus tablet
[2953.78 --> 2954.50]  is gonna be
[2954.50 --> 2955.28]  four hundred bucks
[2955.28 --> 2958.58]  Oliver says
[2958.58 --> 2959.16]  looking forward
[2959.16 --> 2960.68]  to 60 FPS animations
[2960.68 --> 2963.38]  not looking forward
[2963.38 --> 2964.22]  to apps that don't
[2964.22 --> 2965.36]  support material design
[2965.36 --> 2966.64]  inconsistency in apps
[2966.64 --> 2967.46]  is ew
[2967.46 --> 2968.88]  that is a very good point
[2968.88 --> 2970.06]  Nexus 6
[2970.06 --> 2971.10]  is most definitely
[2971.10 --> 2971.56]  flagship
[2971.56 --> 2972.58]  but what about
[2972.58 --> 2973.52]  it makes it more expensive
[2973.52 --> 2974.82]  than the Nexus 9 tablet
[2974.82 --> 2976.76]  that's an interesting
[2976.76 --> 2977.60]  that's an interesting
[2977.60 --> 2978.14]  point
[2978.14 --> 2980.78]  that it can fit
[2980.78 --> 2981.34]  in your pocket
[2981.34 --> 2981.98]  barely
[2981.98 --> 2983.14]  no that it's
[2983.14 --> 2984.26]  that the price
[2984.26 --> 2985.30]  is so much more
[2985.30 --> 2986.88]  than the Nexus 9 tablet
[2986.88 --> 2987.68]  in spite of
[2987.68 --> 2988.50]  like what are
[2988.50 --> 2989.52]  the hardware differences
[2989.52 --> 2990.26]  here exactly
[2990.26 --> 2991.40]  I guess it's
[2991.40 --> 2993.26]  there's less
[2993.26 --> 2994.16]  right
[2994.16 --> 2995.56]  actually I have to do
[2995.56 --> 2996.32]  math to figure that
[2996.32 --> 2997.56]  the pixel density
[2997.56 --> 2998.20]  isn't as high
[2998.20 --> 2998.66]  there's definitely
[2998.66 --> 2999.68]  less pixel density
[2999.68 --> 3001.08]  unless it's a lower
[3001.08 --> 3002.04]  overall resolution
[3002.04 --> 3002.92]  on the Nexus 9
[3002.92 --> 3003.40]  so the
[3003.40 --> 3005.64]  the display itself
[3005.64 --> 3006.18]  could be
[3006.18 --> 3007.90]  a pretty decent factor
[3007.90 --> 3008.84]  yeah but the funny
[3008.84 --> 3009.48]  thing about that
[3009.48 --> 3010.72]  is if you've ever shopped
[3010.72 --> 3012.02]  for replacement displays
[3012.02 --> 3012.68]  for a phone
[3012.68 --> 3013.70]  I bought one for
[3013.70 --> 3014.48]  a Droid DNA
[3014.48 --> 3015.50]  not that long ago
[3015.50 --> 3016.94]  they're not expensive
[3016.94 --> 3018.88]  like even buying them
[3018.88 --> 3019.34]  on eBay
[3019.34 --> 3020.34]  as an end user
[3020.34 --> 3021.14]  so there's
[3021.14 --> 3022.30]  basically like
[3022.30 --> 3023.70]  negligible sales volume
[3023.70 --> 3025.62]  and you have to pay
[3025.62 --> 3026.16]  shipping
[3026.16 --> 3026.66]  and so like
[3026.66 --> 3027.50]  I think I got it
[3027.50 --> 3029.18]  for like 70 or 80 bucks
[3029.18 --> 3029.62]  shipped
[3029.62 --> 3030.74]  to me
[3030.74 --> 3032.00]  so I'm sure
[3032.00 --> 3032.84]  Google isn't paying
[3032.84 --> 3033.36]  that much
[3033.36 --> 3034.58]  for a display
[3034.58 --> 3035.78]  for a 5 inch device
[3035.78 --> 3037.04]  regardless of pixel density
[3037.04 --> 3037.76]  because the Droid DNA
[3037.76 --> 3038.80]  was a pretty high end
[3038.80 --> 3039.48]  display at the time
[3039.48 --> 3040.02]  that was one of the
[3040.02 --> 3041.08]  first 1080p phones
[3041.08 --> 3042.92]  you need to have
[3042.92 --> 3044.56]  iFixit do a tear down
[3044.56 --> 3044.86]  of this
[3044.86 --> 3046.12]  and list the bomb cost
[3046.12 --> 3046.80]  of all of the
[3046.80 --> 3048.20]  all the components
[3048.20 --> 3049.56]  yeah I'd be interested
[3049.56 --> 3050.68]  to see if we're getting
[3050.68 --> 3051.14]  more
[3051.14 --> 3053.16]  if we're getting closer
[3053.16 --> 3054.46]  to Apple like margins
[3054.46 --> 3055.48]  on the Nexus 6
[3055.48 --> 3058.20]  Google's profiting
[3058.20 --> 3059.28]  are the cameras the same
[3059.28 --> 3060.50]  I feel like
[3060.50 --> 3061.60]  the cameras are
[3061.60 --> 3062.44]  13 megapixel
[3062.44 --> 3063.58]  yeah the camera's nicer
[3063.58 --> 3064.58]  13 megapixel
[3064.58 --> 3066.02]  versus 8 megapixel
[3066.02 --> 3068.66]  yeah better camera
[3068.66 --> 3069.90]  slightly higher
[3069.90 --> 3071.06]  slightly higher
[3071.06 --> 3072.02]  pixel count
[3072.02 --> 3073.96]  it's an AMOLED display
[3073.96 --> 3074.80]  so battery life
[3074.80 --> 3075.64]  should be pretty strong
[3075.64 --> 3076.54]  like there's stuff
[3076.54 --> 3077.30]  going that's good
[3077.30 --> 3077.82]  for it but
[3077.82 --> 3079.12]  I guess it all adds up
[3079.12 --> 3079.58]  but yeah
[3079.58 --> 3080.58]  it's still a huge
[3080.58 --> 3081.34]  gap to fill
[3081.34 --> 3084.16]  alright so let's move
[3084.16 --> 3085.02]  on to our next
[3085.02 --> 3085.76]  next topic
[3085.76 --> 3086.44]  this was posted
[3086.44 --> 3087.22]  by Bogus
[3087.22 --> 3087.90]  on the forum
[3087.90 --> 3089.70]  and the source
[3089.70 --> 3090.72]  is Goodwin Proctor
[3090.72 --> 3091.56]  and this is actually
[3091.56 --> 3092.24]  pretty funny
[3092.24 --> 3092.76]  if you
[3092.76 --> 3093.70]  if you have
[3093.70 --> 3094.32]  the kind of sense
[3094.32 --> 3094.68]  of humor
[3094.68 --> 3095.44]  where you get amused
[3095.44 --> 3096.18]  by things that are
[3096.18 --> 3096.86]  super sad
[3096.86 --> 3098.20]  so Goodwin Proctor
[3098.20 --> 3099.44]  publishes a guidebook
[3099.44 --> 3100.44]  on litigating
[3100.44 --> 3101.84]  with non-practicing
[3101.84 --> 3102.46]  entities
[3102.46 --> 3103.46]  also known
[3103.46 --> 3106.20]  as patent trolls
[3106.20 --> 3108.02]  so there's
[3108.02 --> 3108.92]  there's some notes here
[3108.92 --> 3109.66]  a dramatic surge
[3109.66 --> 3110.42]  in patent cases
[3110.42 --> 3112.26]  filed by NPEs
[3112.26 --> 3113.28]  has captured
[3113.28 --> 3113.78]  the attention
[3113.78 --> 3114.66]  of corporate America
[3114.66 --> 3115.56]  as well as
[3115.56 --> 3116.16]  state and federal
[3116.16 --> 3116.78]  legislators
[3116.78 --> 3117.98]  both private
[3117.98 --> 3119.18]  and public sectors
[3119.18 --> 3120.88]  fuel ongoing calls
[3120.88 --> 3121.94]  for new laws
[3121.94 --> 3122.80]  designed to mitigate
[3122.80 --> 3123.78]  or eliminate
[3123.78 --> 3125.00]  the perceived costs
[3125.00 --> 3126.44]  and inefficiencies
[3126.44 --> 3127.86]  of patent troll
[3127.86 --> 3128.66]  litigation
[3128.66 --> 3130.50]  so in their
[3130.50 --> 3131.40]  in their whole
[3131.40 --> 3132.20]  guide to how
[3132.20 --> 3133.28]  to deal with this
[3133.28 --> 3134.14]  there were some
[3134.14 --> 3135.58]  interesting little nuggets
[3135.58 --> 3136.72]  one of which was that
[3136.72 --> 3137.74]  it appears to be
[3137.74 --> 3139.32]  actually more profitable
[3139.32 --> 3140.64]  to patent troll
[3140.64 --> 3142.80]  than to deliver products
[3142.80 --> 3144.58]  and well not necessarily
[3144.58 --> 3145.28]  to deliver products
[3145.28 --> 3145.78]  you're gonna make a lot
[3145.78 --> 3146.30]  of money if you make
[3146.30 --> 3146.72]  a good product
[3146.72 --> 3147.44]  and you sell a lot of them
[3147.44 --> 3148.54]  but to be a company
[3148.54 --> 3150.04]  that actually makes products
[3150.04 --> 3151.80]  and try to sue companies
[3151.80 --> 3152.98]  that infringe your patents
[3152.98 --> 3154.96]  so apparently since 2010
[3154.96 --> 3155.88]  patent trolling
[3155.88 --> 3156.86]  has been more profitable
[3156.86 --> 3157.98]  than actually delivering
[3157.98 --> 3158.80]  a product or service
[3158.80 --> 3159.34]  to market
[3159.34 --> 3161.00]  non-practicing entities
[3161.00 --> 3162.38]  tend to be more successful
[3162.38 --> 3163.04]  in court
[3163.04 --> 3164.64]  than practicing entities
[3164.64 --> 3165.98]  and it's getting to the point
[3165.98 --> 3167.22]  where legitimate businesses
[3167.22 --> 3169.02]  might start doing it as well
[3169.02 --> 3170.64]  so the stats published
[3170.64 --> 3171.50]  by Goodwin Proctor
[3171.50 --> 3172.82]  say that
[3172.82 --> 3173.82]  so between 2010
[3173.82 --> 3174.46]  and 2013
[3174.46 --> 3176.12]  the median gain
[3176.12 --> 3177.00]  from a patent suit
[3177.00 --> 3177.62]  by trolls
[3177.62 --> 3179.32]  is 8.5 million
[3179.32 --> 3180.60]  the median gain
[3180.60 --> 3181.90]  for legitimate businesses
[3181.90 --> 3183.44]  was 2.5 million
[3183.44 --> 3185.28]  so that was in 2013
[3185.28 --> 3186.90]  US dollars
[3186.90 --> 3189.14]  this is like saying
[3189.14 --> 3189.88]  me and Paul
[3189.88 --> 3190.48]  Paul and I
[3190.48 --> 3191.24]  could make more money
[3191.24 --> 3192.18]  as drug dealers
[3192.18 --> 3193.46]  than running an honest
[3193.46 --> 3194.18]  YouTube channel
[3194.18 --> 3195.58]  well we probably could
[3195.58 --> 3196.64]  but the problem here
[3196.64 --> 3197.64]  is they're doing this
[3197.64 --> 3198.02]  under
[3198.02 --> 3199.14]  within the bounds
[3199.14 --> 3199.80]  of the law
[3199.80 --> 3201.12]  yeah and on the backs
[3201.12 --> 3201.98]  of the actual
[3201.98 --> 3202.96]  YouTube channels
[3202.96 --> 3204.14]  some relaxed morals
[3204.14 --> 3204.92]  you'd have to have
[3204.92 --> 3206.64]  to swing this way
[3206.64 --> 3208.98]  there's certain types
[3208.98 --> 3210.22]  of things
[3210.22 --> 3211.28]  that people do
[3211.28 --> 3212.88]  that I really
[3212.88 --> 3213.56]  really hate
[3213.56 --> 3214.36]  and despise
[3214.36 --> 3214.94]  and think is
[3214.94 --> 3215.86]  kind of the lowest
[3215.86 --> 3217.04]  how do you live
[3217.04 --> 3217.74]  with yourself
[3217.74 --> 3218.42]  as a person
[3218.42 --> 3219.96]  if you do this
[3219.96 --> 3222.74]  or work for a company
[3222.74 --> 3223.42]  that does this
[3223.42 --> 3224.92]  I don't know
[3224.92 --> 3225.62]  I have to have
[3225.62 --> 3226.98]  some kind of
[3226.98 --> 3229.60]  moral okayness
[3229.60 --> 3230.20]  with the job
[3230.20 --> 3230.74]  that I'm doing
[3230.74 --> 3231.30]  I have to have
[3231.30 --> 3231.88]  some sort of
[3231.88 --> 3232.50]  investment
[3232.50 --> 3233.26]  and like okay
[3233.26 --> 3233.54]  you know
[3233.54 --> 3234.76]  I'm at least
[3234.76 --> 3235.66]  on some level
[3235.66 --> 3236.96]  like benefiting
[3236.96 --> 3237.68]  society
[3237.68 --> 3238.34]  or producing
[3238.34 --> 3238.94]  something
[3238.94 --> 3240.06]  that's of value
[3240.06 --> 3240.56]  but like
[3240.56 --> 3241.34]  this type of
[3241.34 --> 3241.70]  crap
[3241.70 --> 3242.38]  I just
[3242.38 --> 3243.62]  I despise
[3243.62 --> 3244.88]  like it's
[3244.88 --> 3245.62]  it's really
[3245.62 --> 3246.92]  really terrible
[3246.92 --> 3247.42]  greed
[3247.42 --> 3248.14]  is a monster
[3248.14 --> 3249.06]  in all of us
[3249.06 --> 3249.72]  yes
[3249.72 --> 3251.20]  well put Kyle
[3251.20 --> 3253.44]  dramatic
[3253.44 --> 3254.30]  beer drinking
[3254.30 --> 3255.16]  drink beer now
[3255.16 --> 3256.20]  so
[3256.20 --> 3257.20]  this is
[3257.20 --> 3257.56]  this is
[3257.56 --> 3258.30]  this is actually
[3258.30 --> 3259.02]  this is great
[3259.02 --> 3259.96]  so Michael Strapp
[3259.96 --> 3260.82]  a partner at Goodwin
[3260.82 --> 3261.58]  and one of the
[3261.58 --> 3262.18]  guides authors
[3262.18 --> 3262.78]  explained
[3262.78 --> 3264.04]  why
[3264.04 --> 3265.16]  the damages
[3265.16 --> 3266.38]  awarded to trolls
[3266.38 --> 3267.00]  are disproportionately
[3267.00 --> 3267.42]  high
[3267.42 --> 3267.96]  so there's an
[3267.96 --> 3269.20]  economic model
[3269.20 --> 3270.96]  of patent trolling
[3270.96 --> 3271.70]  that includes
[3271.70 --> 3272.38]  building up
[3272.38 --> 3273.44]  like a legal
[3273.44 --> 3274.26]  war chest
[3274.26 --> 3275.02]  by squeezing
[3275.02 --> 3275.54]  settlements
[3275.54 --> 3276.74]  from dozens
[3276.74 --> 3277.40]  of smaller
[3277.40 --> 3277.94]  companies
[3277.94 --> 3279.06]  then suing
[3279.06 --> 3279.92]  a big fish
[3279.92 --> 3280.50]  like a Google
[3280.50 --> 3281.32]  or an Apple
[3281.32 --> 3282.20]  or something like that
[3282.20 --> 3283.60]  so the patent
[3283.60 --> 3284.02]  trolls
[3284.02 --> 3285.20]  are more capable
[3285.20 --> 3285.82]  of absorbing
[3285.82 --> 3286.62]  a loss
[3286.62 --> 3288.26]  in these litigations
[3288.26 --> 3289.08]  because they've
[3289.08 --> 3290.00]  got their war chest
[3290.00 --> 3290.58]  and
[3290.58 --> 3291.96]  they don't have
[3291.96 --> 3292.92]  actual
[3292.92 --> 3293.64]  you know
[3293.64 --> 3294.26]  physical
[3294.26 --> 3295.02]  inventory
[3295.02 --> 3296.50]  that is going
[3296.50 --> 3297.66]  to cost them
[3297.66 --> 3298.28]  money
[3298.28 --> 3299.04]  if all of a sudden
[3299.04 --> 3300.42]  they can't sell it
[3300.42 --> 3300.96]  because
[3300.96 --> 3301.72]  you know
[3301.72 --> 3302.52]  someone sued them
[3302.52 --> 3303.70]  over a patent
[3303.70 --> 3304.34]  infringement
[3304.34 --> 3304.98]  for example
[3304.98 --> 3306.64]  the trolls
[3306.64 --> 3307.44]  victories in the
[3307.44 --> 3308.08]  small suits
[3308.08 --> 3309.06]  can be used as
[3309.06 --> 3309.56]  evidence
[3309.56 --> 3310.48]  in their suit
[3310.48 --> 3311.76]  against the big fish
[3311.76 --> 3313.18]  something that a big fish
[3313.18 --> 3314.08]  going after someone
[3314.08 --> 3315.00]  who's infringing a patent
[3315.00 --> 3316.10]  won't necessarily have
[3316.10 --> 3317.02]  because they might not be
[3317.02 --> 3317.58]  chasing down
[3317.58 --> 3318.60]  every Tom, Dick, and Harry
[3318.60 --> 3320.16]  and then patent trolls
[3320.16 --> 3321.50]  normally try to settle
[3321.50 --> 3322.68]  outside of court
[3322.68 --> 3323.70]  and the big fish
[3323.70 --> 3324.66]  will usually just
[3324.66 --> 3325.78]  take a big loss
[3325.78 --> 3326.44]  up front
[3326.44 --> 3327.32]  rather than the
[3327.32 --> 3328.34]  guaranteed legal fees
[3328.34 --> 3329.18]  to defend themselves
[3329.18 --> 3329.80]  and the threat
[3329.80 --> 3330.94]  of an even higher fee
[3330.94 --> 3331.84]  if the court
[3331.84 --> 3333.14]  does find in favor
[3333.14 --> 3333.94]  of the troll
[3333.94 --> 3335.94]  unbelievable
[3335.94 --> 3336.84]  I mean
[3336.84 --> 3337.94]  I'm not
[3337.94 --> 3339.68]  I'm not a legal expert
[3339.68 --> 3340.74]  I think that much
[3340.74 --> 3341.46]  should be obvious
[3341.46 --> 3342.10]  but
[3342.10 --> 3343.66]  something
[3343.66 --> 3344.94]  has to be
[3344.94 --> 3345.64]  done
[3345.64 --> 3346.66]  you can't have
[3346.66 --> 3347.74]  legitimate companies
[3347.74 --> 3348.64]  that are innovating
[3348.64 --> 3349.72]  and investing
[3349.72 --> 3350.64]  in technologies
[3350.64 --> 3351.46]  like Apple
[3351.46 --> 3352.08]  and Google
[3352.08 --> 3353.18]  and Microsoft
[3353.18 --> 3354.36]  being sued
[3354.36 --> 3355.04]  by people who
[3355.04 --> 3356.20]  aren't actually
[3356.20 --> 3357.24]  making anything
[3357.24 --> 3358.36]  every time they
[3358.36 --> 3358.92]  turn around
[3358.92 --> 3360.52]  I think it's also
[3360.52 --> 3361.22]  because like
[3361.22 --> 3362.62]  this type of activity
[3362.62 --> 3363.22]  is
[3363.22 --> 3364.46]  it's not very
[3364.46 --> 3364.98]  tangible
[3364.98 --> 3365.64]  you know
[3365.64 --> 3366.18]  it's like
[3366.18 --> 3367.92]  there's legal talk
[3367.92 --> 3369.16]  involved with it
[3369.16 --> 3369.80]  and that sort of thing
[3369.80 --> 3370.46]  so it's difficult
[3370.46 --> 3371.60]  for people to grasp
[3371.60 --> 3372.10]  at first
[3372.10 --> 3372.38]  like
[3372.38 --> 3373.72]  how it even works
[3373.72 --> 3375.36]  but like
[3375.36 --> 3376.00]  I mean
[3376.00 --> 3377.18]  equate it to
[3377.18 --> 3378.08]  like cheating
[3378.08 --> 3378.84]  in a video game
[3378.84 --> 3379.92]  like an aim bot
[3379.92 --> 3380.82]  something like that
[3380.82 --> 3381.24]  that's
[3381.24 --> 3382.38]  that's what it equates
[3382.38 --> 3382.58]  with
[3382.58 --> 3383.12]  I mean
[3383.12 --> 3384.38]  much worse than that
[3384.38 --> 3384.70]  obviously
[3384.70 --> 3385.40]  because there's a lot
[3385.40 --> 3386.20]  more money
[3386.20 --> 3386.86]  at stake
[3386.86 --> 3387.34]  but like
[3387.34 --> 3388.52]  think of the
[3388.52 --> 3389.56]  hatred
[3389.56 --> 3391.06]  that people direct
[3391.06 --> 3392.06]  towards cheaters
[3392.06 --> 3393.48]  online at video games
[3393.48 --> 3394.56]  and then like
[3394.56 --> 3395.90]  transfer that over
[3395.90 --> 3396.70]  to real life
[3396.70 --> 3397.26]  please
[3397.26 --> 3398.82]  and direct it
[3398.82 --> 3399.52]  towards these people
[3399.52 --> 3400.16]  eight and a half
[3400.16 --> 3401.04]  million dollars
[3401.04 --> 3401.62]  on average
[3401.62 --> 3402.46]  yeah
[3402.46 --> 3404.52]  it's like
[3404.52 --> 3404.86]  damn it
[3404.86 --> 3405.48]  that guy stole
[3405.48 --> 3406.66]  my headshot
[3406.66 --> 3408.68]  poverty bot
[3408.68 --> 3410.00]  oh god
[3410.00 --> 3410.80]  poverty bot
[3410.80 --> 3415.82]  that's terrible
[3415.82 --> 3416.66]  this is something
[3416.66 --> 3417.38]  to be pissed off
[3417.38 --> 3417.64]  about
[3417.64 --> 3418.36]  and is this
[3418.36 --> 3418.72]  you know
[3418.72 --> 3419.48]  has there not been
[3419.48 --> 3420.26]  that much backlash
[3420.26 --> 3421.06]  against this sort of
[3421.06 --> 3422.44]  you know
[3422.44 --> 3423.46]  this is more of a
[3423.46 --> 3425.12]  recent crime
[3425.12 --> 3426.00]  against humanity
[3426.00 --> 3426.76]  so to speak
[3426.76 --> 3426.84]  well you can't do
[3426.84 --> 3427.58]  anything about it
[3427.58 --> 3428.22]  that's the problem
[3428.22 --> 3429.02]  is the way the laws
[3429.02 --> 3429.76]  are set up now
[3429.76 --> 3430.42]  is you
[3430.42 --> 3431.66]  you can't
[3431.66 --> 3432.52]  you can't do
[3432.52 --> 3432.86]  anything
[3432.86 --> 3434.74]  so what are you
[3434.74 --> 3435.46]  supposed to do
[3435.46 --> 3437.16]  nothing
[3437.16 --> 3439.70]  I mean there's
[3439.70 --> 3440.60]  yeah
[3440.60 --> 3441.74]  I don't have
[3441.74 --> 3442.36]  I don't have any
[3442.36 --> 3443.44]  good actionable
[3443.44 --> 3444.96]  like suggestions
[3444.96 --> 3445.92]  for people to take
[3445.92 --> 3446.72]  to fix this
[3446.72 --> 3447.68]  that's that's probably
[3447.68 --> 3449.06]  the biggest problem
[3449.06 --> 3449.90]  I mean this
[3449.90 --> 3450.60]  this was one thing
[3450.60 --> 3451.88]  when we were working
[3451.88 --> 3452.48]  for Newegg
[3452.48 --> 3453.56]  that I always appreciated
[3453.56 --> 3454.18]  about them
[3454.18 --> 3455.16]  was that they
[3455.16 --> 3456.04]  their legal team
[3456.04 --> 3456.74]  will actually go
[3456.74 --> 3457.66]  after some people
[3457.66 --> 3458.90]  they've won several
[3458.90 --> 3460.24]  cases against
[3460.24 --> 3461.20]  some pretty large
[3461.20 --> 3461.96]  patent trolls
[3461.96 --> 3463.02]  and that type
[3463.02 --> 3463.76]  of thing can be
[3463.76 --> 3464.10]  yeah
[3464.10 --> 3464.60]  I think there was
[3464.60 --> 3465.46]  a patent for
[3465.46 --> 3467.30]  like one click
[3467.30 --> 3468.66]  one click checkout
[3468.66 --> 3469.58]  or something like that
[3469.58 --> 3470.48]  that Newegg basically
[3470.48 --> 3471.66]  said screw off
[3471.66 --> 3472.10]  we're gonna find it
[3472.10 --> 3472.42]  yeah there was a
[3472.42 --> 3473.58]  one click checkout thing
[3473.58 --> 3474.16]  there's like
[3474.16 --> 3474.94]  the shopping cart
[3474.94 --> 3475.96]  the shopping cart patent
[3475.96 --> 3476.68]  like somebody
[3476.68 --> 3477.12]  tried to be like
[3477.12 --> 3478.74]  oh any online retailer
[3478.74 --> 3479.64]  who has a virtual
[3479.64 --> 3480.48]  shopping cart
[3480.48 --> 3481.88]  like we have a patent
[3481.88 --> 3482.78]  on that so they all
[3482.78 --> 3483.28]  owe us money
[3483.28 --> 3484.26]  but Newegg like
[3484.26 --> 3485.24]  fought them
[3485.24 --> 3486.88]  and took them down
[3486.88 --> 3487.50]  and that sort of thing
[3487.50 --> 3488.28]  but I mean that's still
[3488.28 --> 3489.48]  just that's like a few
[3489.48 --> 3491.00]  there's like a few wins
[3491.00 --> 3491.64]  that they have
[3491.64 --> 3494.88]  the amount of this
[3494.88 --> 3495.58]  that goes on
[3495.58 --> 3496.48]  by comparison
[3496.48 --> 3497.74]  I think is massive
[3497.74 --> 3498.56]  and I mean just
[3498.56 --> 3499.32]  that's what this article
[3499.32 --> 3499.72]  is about
[3499.72 --> 3500.56]  it's obviously
[3500.56 --> 3501.50]  insanely profitable
[3501.50 --> 3503.96]  and the snowballing
[3503.96 --> 3504.86]  effect that has
[3504.86 --> 3506.00]  is insanely profitable
[3506.00 --> 3507.94]  things like this
[3507.94 --> 3508.84]  where people are making
[3508.84 --> 3509.56]  that much money
[3509.56 --> 3510.58]  they can then offer
[3510.58 --> 3511.10]  that money
[3511.10 --> 3512.72]  to people who are smart
[3512.72 --> 3513.62]  who can like
[3513.62 --> 3514.18]  figure out ways
[3514.18 --> 3514.78]  to do it better
[3514.78 --> 3516.18]  like that's been the
[3516.18 --> 3516.84]  problem in the states
[3516.84 --> 3517.68]  for quite a long time
[3517.68 --> 3518.42]  is a lot of like
[3518.42 --> 3519.28]  the smartest people
[3519.28 --> 3520.38]  and the smartest graduates
[3520.38 --> 3521.42]  from schools
[3521.42 --> 3522.88]  are not going into like
[3522.88 --> 3523.34]  science
[3523.34 --> 3524.36]  the science sector
[3524.36 --> 3524.94]  and that sort of thing
[3524.94 --> 3525.86]  they're going into finance
[3525.86 --> 3527.14]  to like learn ways
[3527.14 --> 3528.24]  to game them

[3594.78 --> 3595.34]  stuff
[3595.34 --> 3596.72]  the site is of course
[3596.72 --> 3597.52]  nice
[3597.52 --> 3598.62]  it's functional
[3598.62 --> 3600.38]  it's fast
[3600.38 --> 3601.40]  because it's Squarespace
[3601.40 --> 3602.78]  it's easy to use
[3602.78 --> 3603.58]  on their side
[3603.58 --> 3604.06]  but of course
[3604.06 --> 3604.56]  that's something
[3604.56 --> 3605.08]  that you guys
[3605.08 --> 3605.92]  would have to actually
[3605.92 --> 3607.10]  try out Squarespace
[3607.10 --> 3608.70]  for in order to
[3608.70 --> 3609.62]  in order to be able
[3609.62 --> 3610.82]  to verify for yourself
[3610.82 --> 3611.96]  but I would suggest
[3611.96 --> 3612.72]  trying it out
[3612.72 --> 3613.80]  verifying for yourself
[3613.80 --> 3614.70]  how easily you can
[3614.70 --> 3615.38]  create a beautiful
[3615.38 --> 3616.56]  website for your blog
[3616.56 --> 3617.28]  business
[3617.28 --> 3619.04]  portfolio
[3619.04 --> 3620.08]  whatever else
[3620.08 --> 3620.70]  store
[3620.70 --> 3621.48]  whatever else
[3621.48 --> 3622.40]  the case may be
[3622.40 --> 3623.22]  because it's
[3623.22 --> 3623.92]  it's actually
[3623.92 --> 3624.94]  pretty super awesome
[3624.94 --> 3625.66]  now
[3625.66 --> 3626.60]  it's gotten a lot
[3626.60 --> 3627.48]  more awesome
[3627.48 --> 3628.32]  in the last little while
[3628.32 --> 3628.86]  they've actually
[3628.86 --> 3630.44]  launched a major
[3630.44 --> 3632.06]  major overhaul
[3632.06 --> 3632.72]  so this is now
[3632.72 --> 3634.22]  Squarespace 7
[3634.22 --> 3634.96]  so they've got
[3634.96 --> 3635.76]  cover pages
[3635.76 --> 3636.60]  they've got
[3636.60 --> 3637.90]  Getty image integration
[3637.90 --> 3639.20]  which is pretty
[3639.20 --> 3640.06]  freaking cool
[3640.06 --> 3640.38]  actually
[3640.38 --> 3640.92]  you can get
[3640.92 --> 3641.90]  very good deals
[3641.90 --> 3642.68]  on Getty images
[3642.68 --> 3644.22]  so your site
[3644.22 --> 3644.74]  even though you
[3644.74 --> 3645.96]  don't have a DSLR
[3645.96 --> 3646.72]  and like you know
[3646.72 --> 3647.78]  professional photographer
[3647.78 --> 3648.42]  or whatever else
[3648.42 --> 3649.62]  can look really good
[3649.62 --> 3650.56]  and have great stock
[3650.56 --> 3650.94]  images
[3650.94 --> 3651.84]  very affordably
[3651.84 --> 3652.80]  they've got new
[3652.80 --> 3653.76]  templates to cater
[3653.76 --> 3654.88]  to creators of all
[3654.88 --> 3655.24]  kinds
[3655.24 --> 3655.74]  you can use an
[3655.74 --> 3656.54]  exact design
[3656.54 --> 3657.94]  or you can take a design
[3657.94 --> 3658.70]  and customize it
[3658.70 --> 3659.56]  to make you your own
[3659.56 --> 3660.46]  they've got a Google
[3660.46 --> 3661.30]  partnership to make it
[3661.30 --> 3661.92]  easier to manage
[3661.92 --> 3663.12]  everything on one platform
[3663.12 --> 3664.36]  including branded email
[3664.36 --> 3665.42]  they've got updated
[3665.42 --> 3666.42]  app integration
[3666.42 --> 3667.16]  to work seamlessly
[3667.16 --> 3668.46]  from computer to android
[3668.46 --> 3669.84]  so you can update your blog
[3669.84 --> 3670.82]  take notes on the go
[3670.82 --> 3671.20]  etc
[3671.20 --> 3672.84]  and their dev platform
[3672.84 --> 3674.68]  is finally in full release
[3674.68 --> 3675.80]  so as a developer
[3675.80 --> 3677.72]  you actually have access
[3677.72 --> 3679.38]  to the same
[3679.38 --> 3680.30]  resource
[3680.30 --> 3681.46]  the same platform
[3681.46 --> 3682.54]  that Squarespace uses
[3682.54 --> 3684.40]  for their own site
[3684.40 --> 3685.24]  which is pretty
[3685.24 --> 3686.38]  darn cool
[3686.38 --> 3687.56]  and then they've
[3687.56 --> 3688.98]  actually got this video
[3688.98 --> 3689.92]  that they wanted me
[3689.92 --> 3690.64]  to show you guys
[3690.64 --> 3691.60]  I'm just going to go ahead
[3691.60 --> 3692.98]  and share this
[3692.98 --> 3695.08]  on my screen
[3695.08 --> 3695.68]  I guess
[3695.68 --> 3698.48]  there we go
[3698.48 --> 3700.54]  this is just a pretty cool video
[3700.54 --> 3701.72]  so let's go ahead
[3701.72 --> 3702.98]  and screen share with Linus
[3702.98 --> 3703.30]  woo
[3703.30 --> 3706.44]  this guy is freaking amazing
[3706.44 --> 3707.70]  I had actually never heard
[3707.70 --> 3708.44]  of him before
[3708.44 --> 3710.44]  but his name is
[3710.44 --> 3711.00]  crap
[3711.00 --> 3711.50]  Alex
[3711.50 --> 3712.40]  Alex something
[3712.40 --> 3713.02]  so they've
[3713.02 --> 3714.26]  they've got this video
[3714.26 --> 3716.00]  and the behind the scenes
[3716.00 --> 3717.02]  pictures of this video
[3717.02 --> 3718.34]  were bananas
[3718.34 --> 3720.14]  like getting this shot
[3720.14 --> 3720.80]  right here
[3720.80 --> 3722.20]  involved having a team
[3722.20 --> 3723.10]  of three people
[3723.10 --> 3724.10]  basically
[3724.10 --> 3725.28]  at the
[3725.28 --> 3726.68]  at the edge of
[3726.68 --> 3727.48]  like this
[3727.48 --> 3728.40]  slope
[3728.40 --> 3729.38]  above him
[3729.38 --> 3729.94]  and then they had
[3729.94 --> 3731.00]  this massive
[3731.00 --> 3731.92]  boom arm
[3731.92 --> 3733.06]  that had the camera
[3733.06 --> 3734.08]  kind of hanging down
[3734.08 --> 3734.64]  there we go
[3734.64 --> 3735.48]  Alex Honnold
[3735.48 --> 3737.48]  oh I've heard of this guy

[3738.50 --> 3738.94]  on him
[3738.94 --> 3739.54]  he's insane
[3739.54 --> 3740.28]  he's like the world's
[3740.28 --> 3741.48]  craziest free climber
[3741.48 --> 3741.74]  right

[3745.10 --> 3745.98]  I was looking at it
[3745.98 --> 3746.76]  it was just
[3746.76 --> 3748.50]  incredible
[3748.50 --> 3749.80]  absolutely incredible
[3749.80 --> 3750.62]  so

[3779.62 --> 3780.72]  you know I've actually
[3780.72 --> 3781.38]  heard a lot about
[3781.38 --> 3782.32]  Squarespace lately
[3782.32 --> 3783.42]  two of my
[3783.42 --> 3784.58]  my buddies I reconnected
[3784.58 --> 3785.50]  with from high school
[3785.50 --> 3786.28]  they're both
[3786.28 --> 3787.82]  full time web developers
[3787.82 --> 3788.12]  now
[3788.12 --> 3789.30]  they build websites
[3789.30 --> 3789.80]  professionally
[3789.80 --> 3791.42]  and I was trying to get
[3791.42 --> 3792.70]  my own website started
[3792.70 --> 3793.12]  for
[3793.12 --> 3794.04]  for my own
[3794.04 --> 3794.98]  personal YouTube channel
[3794.98 --> 3795.78]  and I asked them
[3795.78 --> 3796.50]  for any suggestions
[3796.50 --> 3797.38]  of just like a
[3797.38 --> 3798.26]  no-brainer site
[3798.26 --> 3798.76]  that would just
[3798.76 --> 3799.58]  kind of easily
[3799.58 --> 3800.50]  handle things for me
[3800.50 --> 3801.60]  and both of them
[3801.60 --> 3802.86]  simultaneously were like
[3802.86 --> 3803.22]  Squarespace
[3803.22 --> 3805.22]  and so a week later
[3805.22 --> 3805.92]  I signed up for
[3805.92 --> 3807.18]  IX web hosting
[3807.18 --> 3808.62]  which is not
[3808.62 --> 3809.04]  Squarespace
[3809.04 --> 3810.90]  wow
[3810.90 --> 3811.94]  right in the middle
[3811.94 --> 3813.10]  of my sponsorship spot
[3813.10 --> 3813.60]  because
[3813.60 --> 3814.58]  because Steve
[3814.58 --> 3815.34]  from Newegg
[3815.34 --> 3816.78]  is an idiot
[3816.78 --> 3817.84]  and he convinced me
[3817.84 --> 3818.74]  of the wrong choice
[3818.74 --> 3819.06]  clearly
[3819.06 --> 3820.88]  and I succumbed
[3820.88 --> 3822.10]  I succumbed
[3822.10 --> 3822.42]  to the
[3822.42 --> 3824.12]  the persuasion
[3824.12 --> 3824.74]  that is Steve
[3824.74 --> 3825.08]  you should
[3825.08 --> 3826.08]  you should probably
[3826.08 --> 3826.90]  try out Squarespace
[3826.90 --> 3827.82]  if you buy a year
[3827.82 --> 3828.32]  at a time
[3828.32 --> 3829.20]  then they throw in
[3829.20 --> 3829.98]  your domain cost
[3829.98 --> 3830.48]  for free
[3830.48 --> 3831.48]  and
[3831.48 --> 3833.30]  and you get a discount
[3833.30 --> 3833.84]  obviously
[3833.84 --> 3834.36]  because you buy
[3834.36 --> 3835.14]  a year at a time
[3835.14 --> 3836.12]  and oh yeah

[3847.34 --> 3847.88]  above him here
[3847.88 --> 3848.74]  just absolutely
[3848.74 --> 3850.46]  freaking incredible
[3850.46 --> 3851.46]  what's the name
[3851.46 --> 3851.84]  of that

[3869.48 --> 3870.14]  so they've tried
[3870.14 --> 3871.48]  like a discount
[3871.48 --> 3873.02]  and they've tried
[3873.02 --> 3873.76]  putting like
[3873.76 --> 3874.46]  cash
[3874.46 --> 3875.52]  in the box
[3875.52 --> 3876.38]  and now
[3876.38 --> 3876.90]  they're trying
[3876.90 --> 3877.86]  something completely
[3877.86 --> 3878.34]  different
[3878.34 --> 3878.98]  and I'm actually
[3878.98 --> 3879.48]  gonna get
[3879.48 --> 3880.04]  I'm gonna get
[3880.04 --> 3881.16]  all the numbers
[3881.16 --> 3882.04]  right this time
[3882.04 --> 3883.08]  5 4 Club
[3883.08 --> 3884.22]  is the sponsor
[3884.22 --> 3885.00]  whose
[3885.00 --> 3886.52]  integration spots
[3886.52 --> 3887.54]  I have screwed up
[3887.54 --> 3888.30]  more than any other
[3888.30 --> 3888.68]  sponsor
[3888.68 --> 3889.82]  it's a bloody miracle
[3889.82 --> 3890.54]  that they actually
[3890.54 --> 3891.12]  even advertise
[3891.12 --> 3891.92]  with us anymore
[3891.92 --> 3892.72]  because I've given
[3892.72 --> 3893.74]  the wrong pricing
[3893.74 --> 3895.36]  I've given the wrong
[3895.36 --> 3896.02]  um
[3896.02 --> 3896.62]  like
[3896.62 --> 3898.12]  discount
[3898.12 --> 3898.80]  amount
[3898.80 --> 3899.60]  I've done it
[3899.60 --> 3900.40]  I've done everything
[3900.40 --> 3901.02]  everything wrong
[3901.02 --> 3901.50]  with these guys
[3901.50 --> 3902.10]  anyway
[3902.10 --> 3903.02]  this time
[3903.02 --> 3903.94]  we've got it right
[3903.94 --> 3904.74]  bit.ly
[3904.74 --> 3905.98]  slash Linus FFC
[3905.98 --> 3906.94]  use offer code
[3906.94 --> 3907.66]  Linus 2
[3907.66 --> 3908.84]  for an extra item
[3908.84 --> 3909.78]  in your first package
[3909.78 --> 3911.50]  and what would the items
[3911.50 --> 3912.28]  in your package be
[3912.28 --> 3912.84]  you might ask
[3912.84 --> 3913.72]  well 5 4 Club
[3913.72 --> 3915.24]  is the club that you join
[3915.24 --> 3916.00]  if you want to be
[3916.00 --> 3916.92]  well dressed
[3916.92 --> 3918.32]  and you want to do it
[3918.32 --> 3919.56]  without putting any effort
[3919.56 --> 3920.64]  into it whatsoever
[3920.64 --> 3922.26]  basically you go on
[3922.26 --> 3922.68]  their site
[3922.68 --> 3923.66]  you take a survey
[3923.66 --> 3925.06]  that takes literally
[3925.06 --> 3925.88]  seconds
[3925.88 --> 3926.92]  so you just click
[3926.92 --> 3927.52]  get started
[3927.52 --> 3928.38]  you go through a survey
[3928.38 --> 3929.02]  you tell them
[3929.02 --> 3929.62]  you know
[3929.62 --> 3930.54]  about your style
[3930.54 --> 3931.56]  what you like to wear
[3931.56 --> 3932.28]  your sizing
[3932.28 --> 3933.26]  and then they have
[3933.26 --> 3934.40]  your personal style
[3934.40 --> 3934.88]  advisor
[3934.88 --> 3935.62]  pick out clothes
[3935.62 --> 3935.92]  for you
[3935.92 --> 3936.52]  every month
[3936.52 --> 3938.24]  and send them
[3938.24 --> 3939.30]  to you
[3939.30 --> 3940.36]  so the membership
[3940.36 --> 3941.90]  costs 60 bucks
[3941.90 --> 3942.32]  a month
[3942.32 --> 3943.10]  I'm just going to
[3943.10 --> 3943.62]  double check
[3943.62 --> 3944.06]  that make sure
[3944.06 --> 3944.74]  yes good
[3944.74 --> 3945.36]  see I got it
[3945.36 --> 3945.90]  right this time
[3945.90 --> 3946.70]  the membership
[3946.70 --> 3947.50]  costs 60 bucks
[3947.50 --> 3947.88]  a month
[3947.88 --> 3948.74]  and compared
[3948.74 --> 3949.48]  to the retail
[3949.48 --> 3950.30]  pricing on their
[3950.30 --> 3950.70]  clothing
[3950.70 --> 3951.42]  you're going to
[3951.42 --> 3951.86]  be paying
[3951.86 --> 3952.80]  about half
[3952.80 --> 3953.34]  so if you're
[3953.34 --> 3953.86]  on their site
[3953.86 --> 3954.32]  and you say
[3954.32 --> 3955.02]  okay well
[3955.02 --> 3955.68]  these cost
[3955.68 --> 3956.30]  about $120
[3956.30 --> 3957.90]  that's about
[3957.90 --> 3958.84]  how at least
[3958.84 --> 3959.52]  at least
[3959.52 --> 3960.72]  $120 worth
[3960.72 --> 3961.36]  every month
[3961.36 --> 3962.34]  you get for 60 bucks
[3962.34 --> 3963.78]  and what they're
[3963.78 --> 3964.66]  doing for us
[3964.66 --> 3965.48]  is with offer code
[3965.48 --> 3966.18]  Linus2
[3966.18 --> 3967.40]  you get an extra
[3967.40 --> 3968.00]  item worth
[3968.00 --> 3969.42]  35 to 40 bucks
[3969.42 --> 3971.26]  in your package
[3971.26 --> 3972.34]  every
[3972.34 --> 3973.38]  or not every month
[3973.38 --> 3974.10]  the first month
[3974.10 --> 3974.92]  see I almost said
[3974.92 --> 3975.34]  every month
[3975.34 --> 3975.76]  and I almost
[3975.76 --> 3976.40]  screwed it up again
[3976.40 --> 3976.92]  but I'm not going
[3976.92 --> 3977.64]  to do it this time
[3977.64 --> 3979.00]  5-4 club guys
[3979.00 --> 3979.64]  and I clicked the
[3979.64 --> 3980.36]  wrong lower third
[3980.36 --> 3981.08]  okay I did
[3981.08 --> 3982.12]  drop in the ball
[3982.12 --> 3982.44]  man
[3982.44 --> 3983.26]  I can't do anything
[3983.26 --> 3983.64]  right
[3983.64 --> 3984.70]  something about
[3984.70 --> 3985.50]  5-4 club
[3985.50 --> 3987.78]  it's a curse
[3987.78 --> 3989.30]  I wear their shirts
[3989.30 --> 3989.80]  in my tech
[3989.80 --> 3990.38]  quickie videos
[3990.38 --> 3990.86]  all the time
[3990.86 --> 3991.54]  because I really
[3991.54 --> 3992.70]  like that one shirt
[3992.70 --> 3993.20]  it's just got
[3993.20 --> 3993.82]  a nice little
[3993.82 --> 3994.78]  nice little
[3994.78 --> 3995.62]  5-4 logo
[3995.62 --> 3996.26]  and it's like
[3996.26 --> 3996.92]  really comfy
[3996.92 --> 3997.48]  and the buttons
[3997.48 --> 3997.94]  look nice
[3997.94 --> 3998.84]  people compliment me
[3998.84 --> 3999.34]  on that shirt
[3999.34 --> 3999.94]  all the time
[3999.94 --> 4000.34]  actually
[4000.34 --> 4001.30]  I've seen that shirt
[4001.30 --> 4001.90]  it's a nice shirt
[4001.90 --> 4002.82]  it is a nice shirt
[4002.82 --> 4003.70]  I actually really like it
[4003.70 --> 4004.46]  I'd pay 60 bucks
[4004.46 --> 4005.20]  a month for compliments
[4005.20 --> 4006.42]  I never get those
[4006.42 --> 4009.22]  and you're fishing
[4009.22 --> 4009.94]  for them right now
[4009.94 --> 4010.72]  you do enjoy fishing
[4010.72 --> 4011.74]  though don't you Kyle
[4011.74 --> 4013.84]  speaking of
[4013.84 --> 4014.84]  being willing to pay
[4014.84 --> 4015.58]  60 bucks a month
[4015.58 --> 4016.14]  for compliments
[4016.14 --> 4017.42]  I have something nice
[4017.42 --> 4018.02]  to say about
[4018.02 --> 4018.58]  Blackberry
[4018.58 --> 4020.52]  they can't keep
[4020.52 --> 4021.18]  their passport
[4021.18 --> 4021.82]  in stock
[4021.82 --> 4022.68]  I don't know
[4022.68 --> 4023.40]  if this is more
[4023.40 --> 4024.10]  to do with
[4024.10 --> 4024.72]  the fact that
[4024.72 --> 4025.38]  they didn't produce
[4025.38 --> 4025.88]  enough of them
[4025.88 --> 4026.56]  or more to do
[4026.56 --> 4027.24]  with that
[4027.24 --> 4029.60]  it's a really
[4029.60 --> 4030.70]  great amazing
[4030.70 --> 4032.02]  square device
[4032.02 --> 4032.54]  with a keyboard
[4032.54 --> 4032.88]  on it
[4032.88 --> 4033.26]  that people
[4033.26 --> 4033.74]  really really
[4033.74 --> 4034.36]  want to buy
[4034.36 --> 4035.94]  but there you go
[4035.94 --> 4036.34]  they sold
[4036.34 --> 4038.38]  200,000 passports
[4038.38 --> 4040.32]  within 2 days
[4040.32 --> 4041.10]  of launch
[4041.10 --> 4041.48]  and stock
[4041.48 --> 4041.90]  was apparently
[4041.90 --> 4043.22]  completely wiped out
[4043.22 --> 4044.72]  after 6 hours
[4044.72 --> 4045.56]  of sales
[4045.56 --> 4046.62]  Amazon alerted
[4046.62 --> 4047.04]  purchasers
[4047.04 --> 4047.48]  by email
[4047.48 --> 4048.10]  that their passport
[4048.10 --> 4048.64]  had an expected
[4048.64 --> 4049.14]  delivery date
[4049.14 --> 4050.08]  of October 17th
[4050.08 --> 4050.62]  to 20th
[4050.62 --> 4051.32]  with shop
[4051.32 --> 4051.98]  Blackberry
[4051.98 --> 4053.78]  quoting October 29th
[4053.78 --> 4055.10]  as the delivery date
[4055.10 --> 4056.44]  so things are
[4056.44 --> 4057.06]  looking up
[4057.06 --> 4057.76]  maybe for the
[4057.76 --> 4058.40]  Blackberry brand
[4058.40 --> 4058.78]  as they saw
[4058.78 --> 4059.54]  an operating loss
[4059.54 --> 4060.90]  of only 207 million
[4060.90 --> 4061.62]  last quarter
[4061.62 --> 4062.90]  below analyst expectations
[4062.90 --> 4064.34]  they expected
[4064.34 --> 4065.40]  a loss of 16 cents
[4065.40 --> 4065.80]  per share
[4065.80 --> 4066.50]  and only ended up
[4066.50 --> 4067.46]  losing 2 cents
[4067.46 --> 4067.94]  per share
[4067.94 --> 4069.46]  after exclusions
[4069.46 --> 4072.38]  so I haven't tried
[4072.38 --> 4072.98]  the passport
[4072.98 --> 4074.60]  I feel like
[4074.60 --> 4077.46]  I was very dismissive
[4077.46 --> 4077.76]  of it
[4077.76 --> 4078.68]  when I first heard
[4078.68 --> 4079.20]  about it
[4079.20 --> 4082.54]  but would love
[4082.54 --> 4083.56]  to hear what you guys
[4083.56 --> 4084.76]  think about the passport
[4084.76 --> 4085.32]  actually
[4085.32 --> 4086.44]  we're going to do
[4086.44 --> 4087.04]  a straw poll
[4087.04 --> 4087.60]  for this one
[4087.60 --> 4088.74]  rather than a Twitter blitz
[4088.74 --> 4089.50]  just because
[4089.50 --> 4090.76]  that way we can have
[4090.76 --> 4091.22]  something up
[4091.22 --> 4091.78]  while we move on
[4091.78 --> 4092.48]  to the next topic
[4092.48 --> 4093.12]  we don't actually
[4093.12 --> 4094.14]  have a ton of time
[4094.14 --> 4094.46]  left
[4094.46 --> 4095.90]  which is sort of
[4095.90 --> 4096.44]  unfortunate
[4096.44 --> 4098.14]  but um
[4098.14 --> 4099.54]  so much deep
[4099.54 --> 4100.70]  conversation going on
[4100.70 --> 4102.30]  Blackberry passport
[4102.30 --> 4103.70]  yay
[4103.70 --> 4104.90]  nay
[4104.90 --> 4105.84]  meh
[4105.84 --> 4106.42]  those are going
[4106.42 --> 4107.02]  to be the options
[4107.02 --> 4107.58]  because I don't have
[4107.58 --> 4108.18]  a whole lot of time
[4108.18 --> 4109.14]  to create this poll
[4109.14 --> 4112.44]  alright
[4112.44 --> 4113.78]  it's an important one
[4113.78 --> 4115.26]  it is an important one
[4115.26 --> 4116.22]  I really want to know
[4116.22 --> 4117.22]  what people think
[4117.22 --> 4118.44]  of stuff like this
[4118.44 --> 4119.46]  like what the heck
[4119.46 --> 4120.20]  is this thing
[4120.20 --> 4122.28]  I realize now
[4122.28 --> 4123.20]  that I haven't actually
[4123.20 --> 4124.10]  shown a picture of it
[4124.10 --> 4124.60]  on screen
[4124.60 --> 4125.40]  so I should probably
[4125.40 --> 4125.88]  do that
[4125.88 --> 4126.50]  just for folks
[4126.50 --> 4126.66]  who aren't
[4126.66 --> 4126.84]  looks like we got
[4126.84 --> 4128.04]  a spammer in the chat
[4128.04 --> 4128.38]  Linus
[4128.38 --> 4128.84]  I think you need
[4128.84 --> 4129.56]  to kick someone
[4129.56 --> 4130.58]  yeah I know right
[4130.58 --> 4131.22]  I should kick that
[4131.22 --> 4132.08]  Linus tech guy
[4132.08 --> 4132.94]  what a jerk
[4132.94 --> 4133.74]  imposter
[4133.74 --> 4136.06]  alright
[4136.06 --> 4137.66]  here it is
[4137.66 --> 4140.62]  what the
[4140.62 --> 4141.18]  is
[4141.18 --> 4142.22]  is this Blackberry
[4142.22 --> 4142.72]  still running
[4142.72 --> 4143.24]  their own
[4143.24 --> 4144.02]  their own operating
[4144.02 --> 4144.46]  system
[4144.46 --> 4145.94]  yes
[4145.94 --> 4147.10]  but apparently
[4147.10 --> 4148.12]  the integration
[4148.12 --> 4149.34]  of the Play Store
[4149.34 --> 4150.60]  is much better now
[4150.60 --> 4151.30]  and you can basically
[4151.30 --> 4152.24]  just install
[4152.24 --> 4153.14]  Android apps
[4153.14 --> 4153.84]  oh
[4153.84 --> 4154.20]  that's cool
[4154.20 --> 4154.64]  so they're not
[4154.64 --> 4155.52]  nearly as limited
[4155.52 --> 4156.16]  in terms of
[4156.16 --> 4156.86]  app support
[4156.86 --> 4158.26]  right there it is
[4158.26 --> 4158.64]  alright
[4158.64 --> 4159.52]  Linus screen share
[4159.52 --> 4159.86]  boom
[4159.86 --> 4161.08]  Blackberry passport
[4161.08 --> 4163.56]  got your full keyboard
[4163.56 --> 4164.64]  also got a nice
[4164.64 --> 4165.68]  large touch screen
[4165.68 --> 4168.20]  looks like a very
[4168.20 --> 4168.74]  you know
[4168.74 --> 4169.68]  a productivity
[4169.68 --> 4170.72]  friendly
[4170.72 --> 4172.72]  more square
[4172.72 --> 4173.84]  aspect ratio
[4173.84 --> 4174.60]  so I can see
[4174.60 --> 4175.34]  what people like
[4175.34 --> 4175.82]  about it
[4175.82 --> 4177.16]  I'm just
[4177.16 --> 4178.32]  just not sure
[4178.32 --> 4178.88]  if it's
[4178.88 --> 4179.98]  if it's the right
[4179.98 --> 4180.76]  thing for me
[4180.76 --> 4181.38]  necessarily
[4181.38 --> 4182.78]  alright
[4182.78 --> 4183.74]  so let's move on
[4183.74 --> 4184.42]  to the next
[4184.42 --> 4185.28]  topic here
[4185.28 --> 4188.58]  wow
[4188.58 --> 4189.16]  there's a lot
[4189.16 --> 4189.60]  of topics
[4189.60 --> 4190.28]  that I haven't
[4190.28 --> 4191.02]  even touched yet
[4191.02 --> 4191.78]  we're just gonna
[4191.78 --> 4192.32]  have to go through
[4192.32 --> 4192.98]  these pretty fast
[4192.98 --> 4193.84]  Facebook's next phone
[4193.84 --> 4194.36]  might be built
[4194.36 --> 4195.04]  by Samsung
[4195.04 --> 4195.76]  there's been a few
[4195.76 --> 4196.54]  meetings between
[4196.54 --> 4197.72]  top brass
[4197.72 --> 4198.68]  at both companies
[4198.68 --> 4200.16]  and the failure
[4200.16 --> 4201.22]  of the HTC
[4201.22 --> 4201.94]  first
[4201.94 --> 4202.56]  which was the
[4202.56 --> 4203.52]  first Facebook phone
[4203.52 --> 4204.90]  is not stopping
[4204.90 --> 4205.64]  them from planning
[4205.64 --> 4206.22]  a new phone
[4206.22 --> 4206.80]  necessarily
[4206.80 --> 4208.54]  and I don't
[4208.54 --> 4209.14]  think we're gonna
[4209.14 --> 4209.92]  see like a
[4209.92 --> 4210.58]  like a Facebook
[4210.58 --> 4211.50]  only phone
[4211.50 --> 4212.16]  or anything like
[4212.16 --> 4212.42]  that
[4212.42 --> 4213.20]  but it's more
[4213.20 --> 4213.80]  likely to be
[4213.80 --> 4214.36]  something with
[4214.36 --> 4215.02]  some Facebook
[4215.02 --> 4216.10]  features integrated
[4216.10 --> 4216.48]  into it
[4216.48 --> 4217.24]  I mean Samsung's
[4217.24 --> 4217.88]  one of the few
[4217.88 --> 4218.78]  Android handset
[4218.78 --> 4219.44]  makers that is
[4219.44 --> 4220.64]  still really
[4220.64 --> 4221.34]  sticking with
[4221.34 --> 4223.24]  their own skin
[4223.24 --> 4223.78]  on top of
[4223.78 --> 4224.42]  Android that is
[4224.42 --> 4224.98]  really quite
[4224.98 --> 4225.56]  different from
[4225.56 --> 4226.62]  how Android is
[4226.62 --> 4227.46]  supposed to work
[4227.46 --> 4228.84]  LG actually as
[4228.84 --> 4229.40]  well I guess they
[4229.40 --> 4229.96]  still have quite a
[4229.96 --> 4230.48]  few differences
[4230.48 --> 4232.24]  but I could see
[4232.24 --> 4233.08]  Samsung potentially
[4233.08 --> 4233.74]  working in more
[4233.74 --> 4234.58]  Facebook integration
[4234.58 --> 4235.34]  not sure how
[4235.34 --> 4236.04]  beneficial that would
[4236.04 --> 4236.76]  necessarily be to
[4236.76 --> 4237.54]  users but hey
[4237.54 --> 4238.18]  whatever it's
[4238.18 --> 4238.88]  touch whiz so it
[4238.88 --> 4239.18]  wouldn't be the
[4239.18 --> 4239.64]  first time
[4239.64 --> 4242.40]  YouTube ads
[4242.40 --> 4242.94]  linking to
[4242.94 --> 4243.62]  malicious sites
[4243.62 --> 4244.50]  this was posted
[4244.50 --> 4244.96]  on the forum
[4244.96 --> 4245.44]  by rainfall
[4245.44 --> 4246.12]  within and it's
[4246.12 --> 4246.64]  from the trend
[4246.64 --> 4247.70]  micro blog that
[4247.70 --> 4248.14]  we got this
[4248.14 --> 4248.64]  information
[4248.64 --> 4249.78]  basically these
[4249.78 --> 4250.70]  ads were appearing
[4250.70 --> 4251.46]  in videos with
[4251.46 --> 4252.72]  up to 11 million
[4252.72 --> 4253.54]  views and they
[4253.54 --> 4254.02]  don't take you
[4254.02 --> 4254.64]  directly to
[4254.64 --> 4255.28]  malicious sites
[4255.28 --> 4256.40]  but rather first
[4256.40 --> 4257.68]  through advertising
[4257.68 --> 4258.94]  sites so the
[4258.94 --> 4260.38]  exploit used in
[4260.38 --> 4260.98]  this attack was
[4260.98 --> 4261.90]  the sweet orange
[4261.90 --> 4262.68]  exploit kit which
[4262.68 --> 4263.16]  uses certain
[4263.16 --> 4263.94]  vulnerabilities in
[4263.94 --> 4264.84]  Java Flash and
[4264.84 --> 4266.18]  IE and the
[4266.18 --> 4266.86]  final payload of
[4266.86 --> 4267.36]  the attack are
[4267.36 --> 4268.12]  variants of the
[4268.12 --> 4269.08]  Covter malware
[4269.08 --> 4269.84]  family which is
[4269.84 --> 4271.20]  known for ransomware
[4271.20 --> 4271.94]  attacks so there
[4271.94 --> 4273.30]  have been 113,000
[4273.30 --> 4274.68]  victims with 95% of
[4274.68 --> 4275.22]  them being from the
[4275.22 --> 4276.46]  US mind you there
[4276.46 --> 4277.02]  was a patch for
[4277.02 --> 4277.74]  this attack in May
[4277.74 --> 4279.00]  2013 so if you keep
[4279.00 --> 4279.66]  your windows up to
[4279.66 --> 4280.30]  date you're probably
[4280.30 --> 4282.08]  okay now we've got
[4282.08 --> 4282.66]  something that I'm
[4282.66 --> 4283.52]  sure Paul and Kyle
[4283.52 --> 4284.06]  are going to want to
[4284.06 --> 4285.80]  weigh in Bethesda to
[4285.80 --> 4287.88]  officially support 60
[4287.88 --> 4290.08]  FPS with the evil
[4290.08 --> 4291.82]  within on PC this
[4291.82 --> 4292.52]  is posted by
[4292.52 --> 4293.26]  Spoodie on the
[4293.26 --> 4293.76]  forum and the
[4293.76 --> 4294.58]  original article is
[4294.58 --> 4295.94]  from PC Gamer and
[4295.94 --> 4297.30]  it sounds like great
[4297.30 --> 4298.94]  news on the surface
[4298.94 --> 4301.38]  I mean we get some
[4301.38 --> 4302.60]  console commands for
[4302.60 --> 4304.20]  things like god mode
[4304.20 --> 4306.06]  which is cool no clip
[4306.06 --> 4308.88]  which is cool but by
[4308.88 --> 4312.02]  30 FPS they mean
[4312.02 --> 4313.24]  they're unlocking it
[4313.24 --> 4314.38]  from the previously
[4314.38 --> 4316.26]  rumored 30 frames per
[4316.26 --> 4318.54]  second lock to 60 FPS
[4318.54 --> 4321.26]  only so you may run
[4321.26 --> 4323.80]  the game at 30 FPS or
[4323.80 --> 4325.98]  60 FPS but not more
[4325.98 --> 4328.00]  FPS and they are
[4328.00 --> 4328.76]  saying that there's
[4328.76 --> 4329.16]  going to be
[4329.16 --> 4329.92]  potentially some
[4329.92 --> 4330.80]  glitches in the game
[4330.80 --> 4331.74]  at 60 frames per
[4331.74 --> 4333.32]  second at launch but
[4333.32 --> 4334.06]  that they will fix
[4334.06 --> 4335.84]  them and anything
[4335.84 --> 4338.46]  else you can set
[4338.46 --> 4339.18]  whatever resolution
[4339.18 --> 4339.94]  you want but it's
[4339.94 --> 4340.48]  going to be glitchy
[4340.48 --> 4340.80]  and they're not
[4340.80 --> 4341.46]  going to fix it
[4341.46 --> 4344.90]  well kids can I get
[4344.90 --> 4346.96]  better than 30 but
[4346.96 --> 4348.16]  it's still not ideal
[4348.16 --> 4350.76]  for gamers that have
[4350.76 --> 4352.72]  144 hertz or 120
[4352.72 --> 4353.68]  hertz refresh rate
[4353.68 --> 4354.82]  monitors I mean I
[4354.82 --> 4355.84]  think they're still
[4355.84 --> 4356.06]  going to be
[4356.06 --> 4356.84]  disappointed you're
[4356.84 --> 4357.68]  going to appease some
[4357.68 --> 4358.94]  of the population but
[4358.94 --> 4360.58]  for the majority it
[4360.58 --> 4361.34]  just seems like they're
[4361.34 --> 4362.28]  trying to cover up
[4362.28 --> 4363.82]  their mistake or
[4363.82 --> 4367.70]  whatnot so is it like
[4367.70 --> 4368.78]  trying I feel like I'm
[4368.78 --> 4369.76]  trying to look a gift
[4369.76 --> 4370.66]  horse in the mouth here
[4370.66 --> 4372.66]  because it's nice that
[4372.66 --> 4374.90]  they I mean no no
[4374.90 --> 4376.00]  actually never mind I'm
[4376.00 --> 4376.88]  changing my mind right
[4376.88 --> 4377.86]  now screw that because
[4377.86 --> 4378.68]  we should not be like
[4378.68 --> 4379.54]  oh well it was nice of
[4379.54 --> 4380.24]  them to at least give
[4380.24 --> 4381.10]  60 years they should have
[4381.10 --> 4381.86]  given 60 at the
[4381.86 --> 4383.06]  beginning without
[4383.06 --> 4384.24]  having exactly without
[4384.24 --> 4385.02]  having to come out and
[4385.02 --> 4386.06]  be like oh well maybe
[4386.06 --> 4387.00]  give you 60 but we're
[4387.00 --> 4387.64]  not really going to
[4387.64 --> 4388.54]  actually put any effort
[4388.54 --> 4389.64]  into it or support it or
[4389.64 --> 4390.88]  anything like that this
[4390.88 --> 4392.72]  is this is half-assed and
[4392.72 --> 4395.60]  and and and and and we
[4395.60 --> 4397.02]  expect your full ass next
[4397.02 --> 4398.38]  time Bethesda I have a
[4398.38 --> 4399.76]  negative opinion of it
[4399.76 --> 4400.86]  that's what I've decided
[4400.86 --> 4403.56]  yes okay I'm not I'm not
[4403.56 --> 4408.10]  impressed all right well
[4408.10 --> 4408.96]  there's a couple things I
[4408.96 --> 4409.68]  need to mention here
[4409.68 --> 4410.78]  really briefly first of
[4410.78 --> 4411.78]  all we got our poll
[4411.78 --> 4412.86]  results for the BlackBerry
[4412.86 --> 4413.92]  passport with the
[4413.92 --> 4415.46]  overwhelming majority
[4415.46 --> 4417.68]  saying meh or nay and
[4417.68 --> 4420.30]  17% saying yay which is
[4420.30 --> 4421.98]  interesting because 17% of
[4421.98 --> 4423.04]  the smartphone market would
[4423.04 --> 4424.46]  still be a very viable
[4424.46 --> 4425.66]  business for BlackBerry
[4425.66 --> 4429.22]  also I realized that I
[4429.22 --> 4430.78]  never showed the picture of
[4430.78 --> 4433.08]  the extra item from 5-4 so
[4433.08 --> 4434.36]  once again I have screwed
[4434.36 --> 4436.68]  up a 5-4 integration that
[4436.68 --> 4438.12]  is the Henley that you get
[4438.12 --> 4439.32]  don't worry it doesn't
[4439.32 --> 4440.64]  have a crazy pattern on it
[4440.64 --> 4441.54]  it's just made from a
[4441.54 --> 4442.50]  ribbed material actually
[4442.50 --> 4444.32]  looks quite nice so there
[4444.32 --> 4445.98]  you go I screwed up all
[4445.98 --> 4447.46]  the things and once again
[4447.46 --> 4451.94]  go team Linus this is
[4451.94 --> 4452.84]  why this is why you need
[4452.84 --> 4454.72]  to click so but yeah
[4454.72 --> 4456.52]  because normally I can kind
[4456.52 --> 4457.98]  of do these things while
[4457.98 --> 4460.16]  he well he handles a topic
[4460.16 --> 4461.28]  on his own but I don't
[4461.28 --> 4462.32]  trust you guys that much
[4462.32 --> 4463.58]  yeah all right for good
[4463.58 --> 4464.76]  reason well I did have a
[4464.76 --> 4465.82]  half an hour to look over
[4465.82 --> 4467.80]  all the topics so oh yeah
[4467.80 --> 4469.36]  back to the evil within
[4469.36 --> 4470.58]  there are other problems
[4470.58 --> 4472.08]  too you can change the
[4472.08 --> 4474.70]  aspect ratio but some
[4474.70 --> 4477.24]  gameplay prompts appear in
[4477.24 --> 4479.02]  the cinematic black bars
[4479.02 --> 4480.70]  that are going to only be
[4480.70 --> 4481.74]  there if you're running in
[4481.74 --> 4482.90]  the correct cinematic
[4482.90 --> 4485.72]  aspect ratio so you just
[4485.72 --> 4486.90]  won't see those things if
[4486.90 --> 4488.14]  you change the aspect ratio
[4488.14 --> 4489.56]  and no that will not be
[4489.56 --> 4490.42]  fixed either apparently
[4490.42 --> 4491.44]  if they were really
[4491.44 --> 4492.66]  serious about like
[4492.66 --> 4493.80]  wanting to give people a
[4493.80 --> 4494.84]  better experience of that
[4494.84 --> 4495.88]  higher frame rate they
[4495.88 --> 4496.68]  would just make it all
[4496.68 --> 4498.10]  open source so that the
[4498.10 --> 4499.48]  modders could go in who
[4499.48 --> 4500.42]  are really passionate about
[4500.42 --> 4501.74]  it fix all those issues
[4501.74 --> 4502.76]  and make it run at 60
[4502.76 --> 4504.34]  hertz or 60 frames per
[4504.34 --> 4505.66]  second or even beyond
[4505.66 --> 4506.44]  you don't even have to
[4506.44 --> 4507.44]  make it open source for
[4507.44 --> 4508.36]  that you just have to
[4508.36 --> 4510.08]  enable modders yeah
[4510.08 --> 4511.20]  allow some mods to go in
[4511.20 --> 4513.04]  there yeah okay so of
[4513.04 --> 4514.30]  course sorry wrong thing
[4514.30 --> 4515.88]  so of course there was a
[4515.88 --> 4518.20]  big Apple event this week
[4518.20 --> 4519.74]  and I guess I'll have to
[4519.74 --> 4520.90]  do a very quick summary
[4520.90 --> 4521.76]  because quite frankly
[4521.76 --> 4522.88]  there wasn't that much
[4522.88 --> 4524.00]  of interest I mean Apple
[4524.00 --> 4524.86]  pay is coming Monday
[4524.86 --> 4525.68]  which is really cool
[4525.68 --> 4526.60]  they've got hundreds of
[4526.60 --> 4528.00]  banks signed up they've
[4528.00 --> 4529.00]  got lots of merchants
[4529.00 --> 4531.60]  signed up I mean for me
[4531.60 --> 4533.08]  personally the time
[4533.08 --> 4534.68]  savings of whipping out
[4534.68 --> 4536.74]  my phone and trying it
[4536.74 --> 4538.58]  first and then realizing
[4538.58 --> 4539.80]  that you know half the
[4539.80 --> 4540.96]  time plus it's not going
[4540.96 --> 4541.68]  to work and needing to
[4541.68 --> 4542.56]  take out my card anyway
[4542.56 --> 4545.48]  is very limited but the
[4545.48 --> 4546.94]  privacy improvements do
[4546.94 --> 4548.04]  look pretty impressive
[4548.04 --> 4550.52]  so Apple basically stores
[4550.52 --> 4551.42]  any of your card
[4551.42 --> 4552.72]  information in that
[4552.72 --> 4555.16]  isolated non-network
[4555.16 --> 4556.26]  connected chip that's
[4556.26 --> 4557.04]  right on the phone the
[4557.04 --> 4557.80]  same place they keep
[4557.80 --> 4558.34]  your fingerprint
[4558.34 --> 4560.12]  information and they
[4560.12 --> 4561.34]  share none of this info
[4561.34 --> 4563.28]  with the retailer which
[4563.28 --> 4564.40]  is which is very very
[4564.40 --> 4565.58]  cool so you don't have
[4565.58 --> 4567.86]  to worry about your you
[4567.86 --> 4569.28]  know ID being seen by
[4569.28 --> 4570.30]  someone as you hand it
[4570.30 --> 4571.24]  to them you don't have
[4571.24 --> 4572.94]  to worry about your
[4572.94 --> 4574.14]  credit card number being
[4574.14 --> 4576.40]  more easy being easier
[4576.40 --> 4577.72]  to steal I mean actually
[4577.72 --> 4579.16]  there was a leak there
[4579.16 --> 4580.56]  was a leak this week
[4580.56 --> 4581.36]  wasn't there another
[4581.36 --> 4582.72]  retailer lost a bunch of
[4582.72 --> 4584.72]  credit cards what another
[4584.72 --> 4586.78]  one I think so I didn't
[4586.78 --> 4588.08]  catch that yeah I know
[4588.08 --> 4589.32]  I'm sorry you're right
[4589.32 --> 4590.56]  whatever it happens from
[4590.56 --> 4591.88]  time to time so the
[4591.88 --> 4592.62]  retailer themselves
[4592.62 --> 4593.54]  wouldn't even need your
[4593.54 --> 4594.72]  credit card information in
[4594.72 --> 4595.42]  order to process your
[4595.42 --> 4596.44]  payment which is very cool
[4596.44 --> 4598.60]  and it's coming also we
[4598.60 --> 4600.80]  get a retina 5k 27 inch
[4600.80 --> 4602.28]  iMac that's super thin
[4602.28 --> 4603.86]  comes with mobile 290
[4603.86 --> 4606.16]  GPUs and a 295 whatever
[4606.16 --> 4607.58]  that is not 100% sure
[4607.58 --> 4608.94]  what that is but don't
[4608.94 --> 4610.16]  get too wrapped up in how
[4610.16 --> 4611.56]  great a mobile 290 sounds
[4611.56 --> 4612.62]  because that's actually a
[4612.62 --> 4614.02]  pitcairn GPU so it's very
[4614.02 --> 4616.38]  similar to a 7870 actually
[4616.38 --> 4618.22]  not really that special in
[4618.22 --> 4619.36]  terms of performance this is
[4619.36 --> 4622.30]  not a mobile 290 to a
[4622.30 --> 4624.96]  regular 290 is not what a
[4624.96 --> 4627.52]  mobile you know GTX 980 is
[4627.52 --> 4630.38]  to a desktop GTX 980 AMD
[4630.38 --> 4632.38]  hasn't gotten there yet so
[4632.38 --> 4635.30]  5k 5120 by 2880 res it's
[4635.30 --> 4637.04]  got Thunderbolt 2 SSD is
[4637.04 --> 4638.42]  not standard still for some
[4638.42 --> 4639.76]  reason it's got the latest
[4639.76 --> 4641.42]  core i7s and that all
[4641.42 --> 4642.56]  sounds pretty good if you're
[4642.56 --> 4643.52]  one of those people who's
[4643.52 --> 4645.18]  into all-in-ones rather than
[4645.18 --> 4646.14]  having something that just
[4646.14 --> 4647.94]  functions as a display and
[4647.94 --> 4648.64]  then something that you
[4648.64 --> 4650.48]  connect to it because that is
[4650.48 --> 4652.82]  more modular which is good
[4652.82 --> 4656.62]  yeah the new iPad Air 2 and
[4656.62 --> 4659.26]  iPad Mini 3 are coming so
[4659.26 --> 4660.80]  they've sold 225 million
[4660.80 --> 4662.26]  iPads evidently since they
[4662.26 --> 4663.30]  started selling them which is
[4663.30 --> 4664.98]  unbelievable that's like
[4664.98 --> 4667.08]  eight times the number of
[4667.08 --> 4668.92]  people in Canada all together
[4668.92 --> 4671.34]  it's a lot of iPads yeah yeah
[4671.34 --> 4672.88]  that's a lot of iPads this is
[4672.88 --> 4674.22]  starting from the very first
[4674.22 --> 4677.02]  iPad ever created okay so and
[4677.02 --> 4678.02]  I think that's something like
[4678.02 --> 4679.94]  over four times what Samsung
[4679.94 --> 4681.54]  has sold total in spite of them
[4681.54 --> 4682.80]  having so many models of
[4682.80 --> 4684.94]  tablets so it's very very
[4684.94 --> 4686.64]  impressive and then we did
[4686.64 --> 4687.64]  you did you happen to hear
[4687.64 --> 4689.00]  about the uh the the
[4689.00 --> 4691.36]  Microsoft Surface fiasco the
[4691.36 --> 4692.22]  deal they signed with the
[4692.22 --> 4695.00]  NFL yeah I did okay that I
[4695.00 --> 4696.20]  thought that was yeah with all
[4696.20 --> 4697.24]  the commentators calling them
[4697.24 --> 4699.02]  iPads on air even though yeah
[4699.02 --> 4701.74]  yeah I mean the iPad is so to
[4701.74 --> 4703.68]  the average person is that's
[4703.68 --> 4705.88]  just what a tablet is iPad right
[4705.88 --> 4707.80]  exactly Kleenex and it's it's
[4707.80 --> 4708.84]  funny because in the tech space
[4708.84 --> 4710.04]  we don't think about that
[4710.04 --> 4711.94]  because obviously an iPad's an
[4711.94 --> 4713.84]  iPad and other tablets other
[4713.84 --> 4716.10]  tablet but no to regular people
[4716.10 --> 4717.26]  they just don't give two craps
[4717.26 --> 4718.94]  and an iPad's a tablet I love
[4718.94 --> 4720.56]  got to love regular people so
[4720.56 --> 4722.58]  the new iPad Air 2 is 18%
[4722.58 --> 4723.68]  thinner the screen is less
[4723.68 --> 4725.94]  reflective it's got an a8x SoC
[4725.94 --> 4727.62]  which actually has 50% more
[4727.62 --> 4729.34]  transistors than the a8 that we
[4729.34 --> 4731.10]  find in the iPhone 6 and 6 plus
[4731.10 --> 4733.06]  very interesting not sure
[4733.06 --> 4734.90]  necessarily exactly where all
[4734.90 --> 4736.06]  those transistors went but
[4736.06 --> 4737.20]  performance should be pretty
[4737.20 --> 4738.56]  darn impressive it's got a better
[4738.56 --> 4740.80]  camera so you can be a pad hole
[4740.80 --> 4743.82]  walk around take pictures and now
[4743.82 --> 4745.58]  features touch ID which I guess is
[4745.58 --> 4748.72]  good also the the Mac Mini got an
[4748.72 --> 4750.90]  update with the latest Intel CPUs
[4750.90 --> 4752.24]  with Intel Iris graphics to
[4752.24 --> 4753.64]  Thunderbolt 2 ports PCI Express
[4753.64 --> 4755.44]  storage and AC wireless oh yeah the
[4755.44 --> 4756.64]  wireless on the new iPad is
[4756.64 --> 4757.98]  apparently faster too so I guess
[4757.98 --> 4759.54]  that's cool so the one the one
[4759.54 --> 4760.80]  thing about this whole Apple event
[4760.80 --> 4762.94]  that's kind of irritating me is
[4762.94 --> 4765.04]  since since the new version of the
[4765.04 --> 4767.34]  operating system is called Yosemite I
[4767.34 --> 4768.64]  feel like they've been co-opting
[4768.64 --> 4770.42]  images of Yosemite and using them
[4770.42 --> 4771.82]  for Apple branding and it pisses me
[4771.82 --> 4772.52]  off
[4772.52 --> 4776.42]  mother nature is going to sue Apple
[4776.42 --> 4779.16]  as the ultimate irony who's gonna go
[4779.16 --> 4780.52]  and be like no half dome is a
[4780.52 --> 4782.64]  registered trademark of Yosemite and
[4782.64 --> 4785.54]  and Apple and apparently now also an
[4785.54 --> 4788.44]  Apple like I don't want I don't want
[4788.44 --> 4789.80]  half dome to be used to sell Apple
[4789.80 --> 4791.60]  products Apple is reportedly suing
[4791.60 --> 4793.78]  mother nature for the usage of half
[4793.78 --> 4795.38]  dome it's all that's marketing
[4795.38 --> 4796.08]  branding
[4796.08 --> 4798.66]  okay sorry okay sorry oh yeah I
[4798.66 --> 4800.54]  guess I didn't really talk about the
[4800.54 --> 4802.66]  new OS X at all I guess I just don't
[4802.66 --> 4803.08]  care
[4803.08 --> 4808.96]  and yo cheers well it's not it's not
[4808.96 --> 4810.38]  that I don't care because it's bad I
[4810.38 --> 4811.66]  just don't care because I didn't use
[4811.66 --> 4813.30]  the old one so all these new amazing
[4813.30 --> 4815.00]  differences mean nothing to me because
[4815.00 --> 4817.46]  I don't have any frustrations with the
[4817.46 --> 4818.86]  old one or anything that I like about
[4818.86 --> 4820.16]  the old one it just is what it is
[4820.16 --> 4822.38]  speaking of things that are what they
[4822.38 --> 4824.84]  are augmented reality might not be
[4824.84 --> 4826.34]  necessarily what we thought it was
[4826.34 --> 4828.68]  going to be I mean I think that Google
[4828.68 --> 4831.56]  Glass looked very augmented reality from
[4831.56 --> 4832.70]  the beginning like we were kind of
[4832.70 --> 4833.72]  thinking we were going to be wearing
[4833.72 --> 4836.68]  glasses or goggles or whatever else but
[4836.68 --> 4838.48]  there's this is a rumor right now but
[4838.48 --> 4840.44]  Google and others may invest five
[4840.44 --> 4843.08]  million five hundred million dollars into
[4843.08 --> 4846.26]  augmented reality company magic leap who
[4846.26 --> 4847.58]  isn't going to be putting a lens in
[4847.58 --> 4849.68]  front of your eyes but rather is
[4849.68 --> 4852.14]  planning to basically beam the image
[4852.14 --> 4856.10]  into your eyes allegedly solving the
[4856.10 --> 4859.28]  need for higher resolution in this
[4859.28 --> 4861.98]  solutions like oculus rift with the with
[4861.98 --> 4864.62]  a headset are going to have so the vision
[4864.62 --> 4866.02]  would be to have the product display an
[4866.02 --> 4867.86]  image into the eye so that instead of
[4867.86 --> 4870.20]  having to pull out a phone you would just
[4870.20 --> 4874.52]  see things in the world around you that I
[4874.52 --> 4876.02]  mean it's funny they're calling it
[4876.02 --> 4878.14]  cinematic reality because they think
[4878.14 --> 4880.36]  augmented reality is a bit of an and
[4880.36 --> 4882.64]  undersells the technology a little bit
[4882.64 --> 4884.26]  because of how realistic it is but I
[4884.26 --> 4887.70]  mean this is what it is here's an
[4887.70 --> 4890.44]  elephant an augmented reality elephant in
[4890.44 --> 4892.06]  the hand of someone you can call it
[4892.06 --> 4894.22]  whatever you want but it's still
[4894.22 --> 4897.82]  augmented reality looks incredibly cool
[4897.82 --> 4900.34]  and gaming with the technology like this
[4900.34 --> 4901.60]  where you don't even have to wear a
[4901.60 --> 4903.82]  headset and you just see stuff that
[4903.82 --> 4911.08]  isn't there wow so I'm getting this image
[4911.08 --> 4913.38]  in my head of like kind of like in the
[4913.38 --> 4915.00]  matrix you know when he wakes up and
[4915.00 --> 4916.58]  there's just the rows and rows of people
[4916.58 --> 4918.04]  you know they're all all in their little
[4918.04 --> 4920.68]  pods like something like that with all
[4920.68 --> 4922.16]  these people and and these little
[4922.16 --> 4923.82]  devices in front of them just beaming
[4923.82 --> 4926.00]  images like directly into their brain but
[4926.00 --> 4927.64]  but really what this has inspired me to
[4927.64 --> 4930.22]  do is developed my own device kind of
[4930.22 --> 4932.50]  based on this same technology which is
[4932.50 --> 4934.06]  gonna be a food delivery system that
[4934.06 --> 4936.52]  puts a tube down your throat and just
[4936.52 --> 4938.26]  puts the food directly into your
[4938.26 --> 4939.94]  stomach that way you don't have to
[4939.94 --> 4941.88]  worry about the whole chewing and
[4941.88 --> 4944.00]  swallowing thing you could partner with
[4944.00 --> 4945.88]  partner with the guys that make
[4945.88 --> 4949.14]  Soylent exactly yeah Luke's been on
[4949.14 --> 4952.08]  has is Luke like does Luke look paler
[4952.08 --> 4953.46]  or anything like that or is he like
[4953.46 --> 4955.40]  becoming more and more stronger than he
[4955.40 --> 4957.94]  has ever been no he seems he seems all
[4957.94 --> 4960.34]  right he's not entirely on Soylent though
[4960.34 --> 4963.30]  he does he does eat it for you know most
[4963.30 --> 4965.34]  of his nutritional stuff but he still
[4965.34 --> 4968.82]  eats but mostly just because eating is
[4968.82 --> 4970.48]  kind of nice and things taste good and
[4970.48 --> 4972.72]  Soylent doesn't taste that great I'm
[4972.72 --> 4975.04]  glad you've been feeding him yeah well I
[4975.04 --> 4977.14]  don't feed him he has to feed himself
[4977.14 --> 4979.34]  okay I just watch
[4979.34 --> 4985.10]  because it's liquid right so there's just
[4985.10 --> 4986.96]  these visuals I have of Linus feeding
[4986.96 --> 4989.38]  Luke with like a big baby bottle or
[4989.38 --> 4989.78]  something
[4989.78 --> 4994.48]  right that could be a t-shirt that's
[4994.48 --> 4997.10]  the worst image that's ever been in
[4997.10 --> 4999.22]  anyone's head during this show I'm
[4999.22 --> 5000.86]  happy to have brought it to all of your
[5000.86 --> 5001.24]  fans
[5001.24 --> 5003.78]  thank you
[5003.78 --> 5007.58]  you guys will never be on my show again
[5007.58 --> 5013.20]  get up all right so skype kick I guess
[5013.20 --> 5014.84]  would be how we pronounce this QIK this
[5014.84 --> 5016.34]  was originally posted by goodbytes on
[5016.34 --> 5019.10]  the forum the article is from theverge.com
[5019.10 --> 5024.04]  and this is supposed to be a an attempt to
[5024.04 --> 5027.50]  take over mobile video messaging so it
[5027.50 --> 5030.32]  this actually started out as just a video
[5030.32 --> 5033.08]  consumption platform but oh I just
[5033.08 --> 5034.64]  realized I'm not actually screen sharing
[5034.64 --> 5036.14]  with you guys so there you go they're
[5036.14 --> 5038.24]  showing it running on Windows Phone as if
[5038.24 --> 5041.84]  that matters iOS and Android unless that
[5041.84 --> 5045.02]  HTC 1 M8 is a Windows Phone version of
[5045.02 --> 5047.42]  the HTC 1 M8 which it probably isn't
[5047.42 --> 5048.38]  because I don't think anyone ever
[5048.38 --> 5050.96]  actually bought one of those although I'd
[5050.96 --> 5052.16]  love to be proven wrong you know it's
[5052.16 --> 5054.44]  amazing how many people are hating on me
[5054.44 --> 5058.16]  for my negativity about the Windows Phone
[5058.16 --> 5061.58]  HTC 1 M8 in my review and yet I have
[5061.58 --> 5064.28]  never seen one I've never heard any report
[5064.28 --> 5066.38]  of anyone owning it ever and people
[5066.38 --> 5068.48]  misinterpreted a lot of what I said I
[5068.48 --> 5071.90]  didn't say Windows 8 phone is a platform
[5071.90 --> 5074.48]  for nobody what I said was this is a
[5074.48 --> 5078.02]  device for nobody a high-end truly high-end
[5078.02 --> 5081.38]  premium cost device that runs Windows Phone
[5081.38 --> 5083.78]  because the people who buy high-end devices
[5083.78 --> 5086.36]  are going to have needs for their mobile
[5086.36 --> 5088.46]  devices that go beyond what Windows Phone
[5088.46 --> 5091.10]  can do because the app ecosystem is so
[5091.10 --> 5093.92]  immature speaking of which I'm still super
[5093.92 --> 5095.84]  upset that the NFC chip in here only does
[5095.84 --> 5097.28]  Apple Pay and doesn't do other stuff
[5097.28 --> 5099.08]  anyway it started as a video streaming
[5099.08 --> 5100.64]  service was available on mobile devices
[5100.64 --> 5102.62]  before YouTube so this is kind of an old
[5102.62 --> 5104.42]  platform it's all done through your
[5104.42 --> 5106.10]  mobile phone number no account sign up is
[5106.10 --> 5108.38]  necessary it's been being pitched as an
[5108.38 --> 5110.12]  alternative to text messaging and can
[5110.12 --> 5111.44]  easily switch between the front and rear
[5111.44 --> 5113.66]  cameras while recording there's no preview
[5113.66 --> 5116.84]  or processing and it has a 42 second max
[5116.84 --> 5118.64]  recording you can send to one person or a
[5118.64 --> 5119.90]  group and if your friend doesn't have
[5119.90 --> 5121.82]  kick they will receive an SMS with
[5121.82 --> 5125.60]  instructions on how to download it so
[5125.60 --> 5128.54]  you can pre-record up to 12 messages for
[5128.54 --> 5130.28]  use when you're in a rush so just
[5130.28 --> 5132.80]  pre-recorded like hey I can't talk right
[5132.80 --> 5134.48]  now I don't know why people would want
[5134.48 --> 5136.34]  that instead of an SMS but sure whatever
[5136.34 --> 5138.62]  yeah messages disappear after two weeks if
[5138.62 --> 5141.60]  they aren't deleted like practically
[5141.60 --> 5143.12]  speaking to me this this seems like
[5143.12 --> 5144.86]  something that might be a competitor for
[5144.86 --> 5146.54]  like vine or something like that but
[5146.54 --> 5149.04]  like no because it's messaging not
[5149.04 --> 5150.68]  broadcast it's more like like like
[5150.68 --> 5152.50]  snapchat it's more like a competitor to
[5152.50 --> 5154.66]  snapchat but like so now we can have
[5154.66 --> 5156.58]  videos of penises instead of pictures
[5156.58 --> 5158.34]  of them like is that you can do video
[5158.34 --> 5160.26]  with snapchat too that was a benefit that
[5160.26 --> 5161.58]  I hadn't considered but I mean the
[5161.58 --> 5163.22]  beautiful the beautiful thing about a
[5163.22 --> 5164.64]  text message is when I get a text
[5164.64 --> 5166.42]  message I can glance at my phone without
[5166.42 --> 5167.96]  unlocking without doing anything and it
[5167.96 --> 5170.28]  can appear on one or two lines and I
[5170.28 --> 5172.34]  can immediately know what was said and
[5172.34 --> 5174.80]  it's faster than watching a short video
[5174.80 --> 5176.50]  of somebody being like hey man I'll call
[5176.50 --> 5177.94]  you later or something like that like
[5177.94 --> 5180.16]  well that's a stupid reason to send a
[5180.16 --> 5181.54]  video to someone just to tell them that
[5181.54 --> 5182.76]  you'll call them later but that's what
[5182.76 --> 5185.46]  it has pre-recorded like messages like
[5185.46 --> 5187.62]  hey I'm in class right now like that's
[5187.62 --> 5188.94]  the kind of thing people use that stuff
[5188.94 --> 5191.46]  for so the pre-recorded stuff is useless
[5191.46 --> 5193.40]  it's all garbage it's short message
[5193.40 --> 5194.96]  service it's supposed to be like a quick
[5194.96 --> 5196.72]  communication a quick interaction with
[5196.72 --> 5198.98]  someone and feels this feels like a
[5198.98 --> 5200.94]  step backwards this feels like video
[5200.94 --> 5204.46]  voicemail all right exactly what one
[5204.46 --> 5205.82]  application I could see this in is
[5205.82 --> 5207.56]  like let's say you're in a place that
[5207.56 --> 5208.72]  you've never been before and you're
[5208.72 --> 5210.26]  meeting someone there for the first
[5210.26 --> 5211.90]  time you could send them a message and
[5211.90 --> 5213.56]  say hey I'm here waiting for you you
[5213.56 --> 5215.38]  can also send them an MMS with a picture
[5215.38 --> 5218.34]  of you yeah but the picture is is only
[5218.34 --> 5220.24]  go so far if you're in a location they
[5220.24 --> 5222.18]  need to see visually where you are 360
[5222.18 --> 5223.72]  degree view you can actually give them a
[5223.72 --> 5225.48]  panoramic shot of where you are maybe
[5225.48 --> 5227.08]  in this location so they can recognize it
[5227.08 --> 5228.44]  when they walk up to the place so you
[5228.44 --> 5230.78]  could send them a panoramic picture so
[5230.78 --> 5232.28]  you can send them a panoramic picture
[5232.28 --> 5234.88]  or video you could send them three
[5234.88 --> 5239.82]  pictures fail Kyle fail no put a filter
[5239.82 --> 5241.46]  on it Linus Kyle's already put a filter
[5241.46 --> 5243.42]  on Kyle has already invested in quick I
[5243.42 --> 5245.82]  think which is why he's really I am the
[5245.82 --> 5248.04]  first investor in quick is it quick or
[5248.04 --> 5251.12]  kick I don't care if it's a Q I feel
[5251.12 --> 5253.44]  like it should be but there's no you
[5253.44 --> 5257.28]  no you're right it's okay the U is not
[5257.28 --> 5259.74]  silent because it's not there that's
[5259.74 --> 5262.62]  not proper like use of Q anyway this
[5262.62 --> 5264.36]  is cool this was posted by r are
[5264.36 --> 5266.64]  bolson on the forum and it's the Carl
[5266.64 --> 5269.76]  Zeiss VR one so we know about Samsung's
[5269.76 --> 5272.16]  VR headset for the note and we know
[5272.16 --> 5274.62]  about Google cardboard which is obviously
[5274.62 --> 5276.42]  not going to be the greatest solution
[5276.42 --> 5278.04]  ever because it's like going to fall
[5278.04 --> 5280.14]  apart and stuff but this is the VR one
[5280.14 --> 5281.70]  which is a more flexible one so you
[5281.70 --> 5284.76]  basically just buy like a like a tray so
[5284.76 --> 5287.22]  here's what one of the really I can't
[5287.22 --> 5289.60]  mouse over this without this stupid
[5289.60 --> 5291.60]  thing well whatever you have to envision
[5291.60 --> 5293.40]  my mouse over there so you buy a tray
[5293.40 --> 5295.02]  that your phone slips into anything from
[5295.02 --> 5298.14]  4.7 to 5.2 inches and then you can use
[5298.14 --> 5301.56]  your phone as a best VR so that's cool I
[5301.56 --> 5305.10]  guess moving right along PewDiePie may be
[5305.10 --> 5307.20]  starting his own YouTube network so this
[5307.20 --> 5311.46]  was an interview with pulse2.com and then
[5311.46 --> 5314.52]  he was also on the cover of icon magazine.se
[5314.52 --> 5315.84]  this was posted by Tech Dreamer on the
[5315.84 --> 5318.00]  forum and actually generated a lot of
[5318.00 --> 5321.12]  discussion he makes an estimated 4
[5321.12 --> 5323.58]  million per year in ad sales so that's
[5323.58 --> 5326.16]  gross and that was last year so I can
[5326.16 --> 5327.42]  assure you it's a lot more this year
[5327.42 --> 5328.98]  plans to leave maker studios in
[5328.98 --> 5330.30]  December to create his own network
[5330.30 --> 5332.22]  thinks other networks have been managed
[5332.22 --> 5334.02]  in such an incredibly poor way that it's
[5334.02 --> 5336.00]  silly and would like to help other
[5336.00 --> 5338.64]  youtubers and say what you want about
[5338.64 --> 5341.52]  pewds you know how you might like or
[5341.52 --> 5344.10]  dislike his content or whatever the
[5344.10 --> 5347.34]  guy's smart and maybe I should join his
[5347.34 --> 5350.94]  network how do you know he's smart how
[5350.94 --> 5352.80]  do you know he's not just incredibly
[5352.80 --> 5355.92]  lucky and anyone remotely attractive for
[5355.92 --> 5358.32]  you know to personality anyone anyone at
[5358.32 --> 5360.54]  the top of any field is smart guarantee it
[5360.54 --> 5365.52]  I don't know I've been mom had some some
[5365.52 --> 5370.82]  fame there for you octom on octom on yeah
[5370.82 --> 5373.14]  but that's not the top of a field that's
[5373.14 --> 5375.24]  a 15 minutes of fame I'm talking someone
[5375.24 --> 5376.68]  who is in a field of her own in a
[5376.68 --> 5381.00]  sustained repeated manner beat everyone
[5381.00 --> 5383.32]  else who competes at something I've seen
[5383.32 --> 5385.62]  some actors who wouldn't line up with
[5385.62 --> 5387.84]  that but what does PewDiePie do that no
[5387.84 --> 5389.90]  one else can do I mean I hold on a second
[5389.90 --> 5393.06]  okay remember you some actors that are
[5393.06 --> 5395.80]  dumb sure but I said at the top of a
[5395.80 --> 5397.78]  field PewDiePie is the number one
[5397.78 --> 5399.98]  youtuber put me at the number one of
[5399.98 --> 5402.50]  anything where the person's an idiot you
[5402.50 --> 5404.94]  can't do it are you still on a network
[5404.94 --> 5407.36]  or at this point Linus uh yeah I'm I'm
[5407.36 --> 5408.74]  with twitch right now but I'm actually
[5408.74 --> 5412.34]  probably switching on youtube on twitch
[5412.34 --> 5414.18]  tv I'm still gonna stay partnered with
[5414.18 --> 5415.20]  twitch I'm still gonna do all my
[5415.20 --> 5417.22]  streaming on twitch but on youtube I'll
[5417.22 --> 5420.62]  potentially be moving over to um well I
[5420.62 --> 5421.72]  feel bad for not remembering maker
[5421.72 --> 5424.46]  studios no okay isn't that isn't that
[5424.46 --> 5426.02]  what you do that PewDiePie is leaving
[5426.02 --> 5427.70]  PewDiePie is leaving that no I think
[5427.70 --> 5429.22]  that might be why I have maker studios
[5429.22 --> 5430.90]  in my head I'm gonna have to look it up
[5430.90 --> 5433.24]  now when's the Linus network coming in
[5433.24 --> 5434.98]  what can I join and do you feel like
[5434.98 --> 5436.36]  you have some big shoes to feel and
[5436.36 --> 5437.80]  sure yes I'll join your network
[5437.80 --> 5439.72]  replacing PewDiePie thanks for asking
[5439.72 --> 5443.50]  studios network sorry I feel I feel the
[5443.50 --> 5445.60]  full screen full screen sorry not maker
[5445.60 --> 5447.64]  I've talked to every network at some
[5447.64 --> 5449.08]  point in hey we're on full screen
[5449.08 --> 5450.34]  yeah full screen yeah full screen is
[5450.34 --> 5453.22]  awesome yeah so I so I might be joining
[5453.22 --> 5459.12]  full screen okay I I like full screen I
[5459.12 --> 5461.50]  don't have a problem with them all right
[5461.50 --> 5463.82]  so let's go ahead and see if we've got
[5463.82 --> 5465.82]  any more oh yeah Netflix raises the price
[5465.82 --> 5468.10]  for 4k video streaming this was posted by
[5468.10 --> 5470.06]  tech dreamer on the forum and this is
[5470.06 --> 5472.24]  actually the second price hike we've seen
[5472.24 --> 5475.44]  from netlink Netflix in like what a year so
[5475.44 --> 5477.54]  and that was after for a long time the
[5477.54 --> 5480.00]  pricing being very very stable so if you
[5480.00 --> 5481.50]  signed up for a 4k enabled account
[5481.50 --> 5482.82]  already you get to keep your current
[5482.82 --> 5485.34]  subscription price until August 12 2016
[5485.34 --> 5486.92]  but for new subscribers the monthly
[5486.92 --> 5489.60]  price for 4k will be 12 bucks so you can
[5489.60 --> 5492.28]  enjoy 4k content like Breaking Bad House
[5492.28 --> 5495.48]  of Cards and the Smurfs on your 4k TV
[5495.48 --> 5497.40]  that you also probably don't own yet
[5497.40 --> 5501.06]  although 4k doesn't work on all TVs you
[5501.06 --> 5502.80]  need to have a supported TV so once again
[5502.80 --> 5504.80]  early adopters for any new video
[5504.80 --> 5507.80]  standard get the old kick in the teeth
[5507.80 --> 5510.16]  way to go you spent way too much on
[5510.16 --> 5512.16]  something that not only didn't work when
[5512.16 --> 5513.54]  you bought it but isn't even going to
[5513.54 --> 5515.18]  work at the time that it was supposed to
[5515.18 --> 5517.28]  work that's why you go with an HTPC it's
[5517.28 --> 5521.54]  pretty normal but uh yeah this was one of
[5521.54 --> 5523.54]  those stories where I was like okay I mean
[5523.54 --> 5525.26]  I think the people right now who have the
[5525.26 --> 5527.92]  capability to watch Netflix and 4k aren't
[5527.92 --> 5530.32]  really probably going to be too pissed off by
[5530.32 --> 5533.86]  three extra dollars a month I would hope
[5533.86 --> 5535.12]  that once it becomes a little bit more
[5535.12 --> 5536.44]  mainstream maybe they'll do like a
[5536.44 --> 5538.22]  discount plan or something knock it down
[5538.22 --> 5542.28]  to 10 I'll sign up for 10 all right so
[5542.28 --> 5544.82]  next up we've got the snapening snap
[5544.82 --> 5547.90]  saved images leaked so 500 megs of images
[5547.90 --> 5549.74]  were leaked according to snap saved
[5549.74 --> 5551.70]  snap saved.com is a website that allows
[5551.70 --> 5554.50]  users to save snapchat messages and it was
[5554.50 --> 5556.32]  compromised their database was immediately
[5556.32 --> 5558.36]  deleted when the hack was discovered but
[5558.36 --> 5560.22]  there are concerns that many of the leaked
[5560.22 --> 5562.68]  images could be classified as child porn
[5562.68 --> 5566.22]  so yeah
[5566.22 --> 5572.44]  that's a that's a messy situation I guess
[5572.44 --> 5573.66]  that's all there is to really say about
[5573.66 --> 5575.80]  that although one pirate bay user
[5575.80 --> 5577.54]  complained that so far from what I've
[5577.54 --> 5579.58]  seen the vast majority are just black
[5579.58 --> 5581.12]  screens with text overlaid or just a
[5581.12 --> 5583.86]  normal selfie that would be my initial
[5583.86 --> 5585.50]  response like man the pictures aren't even
[5585.50 --> 5589.26]  that good Nexus player is coming so this
[5589.26 --> 5590.96]  was posted by laws on the forum the
[5590.96 --> 5592.82]  original source is Google's own page
[5592.82 --> 5594.38]  about it so let's go check that thing
[5594.38 --> 5594.92]  out
[5594.92 --> 5598.46]  whoo Nexus player so you know who yeah
[5598.46 --> 5601.28]  good idea but probably ahead of your
[5601.28 --> 5603.62]  time a little bit there and the page is
[5603.62 --> 5605.66]  loading a bit slowly so sorry about that
[5605.66 --> 5608.72]  but at any rate the Nexus player is
[5608.72 --> 5610.04]  coming it's going to come with a remote
[5610.04 --> 5612.14]  and a controller the remote has voice
[5612.14 --> 5614.06]  search comes with apps such as Netflix
[5614.06 --> 5617.30]  and Ted there's a full list on the on the
[5617.30 --> 5618.68]  Google page for it that I would love to
[5618.68 --> 5619.82]  show you except that it's not loading
[5619.82 --> 5621.74]  right now and it has free online
[5621.74 --> 5625.34]  multiplayer from Google Play games so the
[5625.34 --> 5628.10]  thing that all consoles should always
[5628.10 --> 5631.40]  have forever because it's just baffling to
[5631.40 --> 5633.02]  me that you have to pay to subscribe to
[5633.02 --> 5634.52]  multiplayer service when you already bought
[5634.52 --> 5636.68]  the game and you already have your
[5636.68 --> 5639.46]  internet connection it's got a 1.8 gigahertz
[5639.46 --> 5642.34]  quad-core Intel Atom processor 802.11ac
[5642.34 --> 5644.92]  2x2 Mimo so that's a pretty good
[5644.92 --> 5647.20]  wireless solution HDMI out and it'll
[5647.20 --> 5649.06]  cost $100 and the controller will cost
[5649.06 --> 5652.84]  40 bucks and one thing though that's
[5652.84 --> 5654.04]  missing and it better have a good
[5654.04 --> 5655.60]  wireless solution because it does not
[5655.60 --> 5657.88]  have a wired network connection that's a
[5657.88 --> 5661.66]  bit of a killer for me oh damn yeah I
[5661.66 --> 5663.88]  personally have to pee I'll be right back
[5663.88 --> 5666.46]  thank you thank you thank you Kyle you
[5666.46 --> 5668.22]  should end the show while he's gone so
[5668.22 --> 5669.62]  that I don't have to talk about where
[5669.62 --> 5671.42]  people can go watch Kyle make videos
[5671.42 --> 5673.46]  that's all right yeah we'll leave his
[5673.46 --> 5675.46]  plugs out of it so so this is like I
[5676.10 --> 5677.56]  don't know this is like the upgrade to
[5677.56 --> 5679.60]  the Chromecast I guess it's it's Android
[5679.60 --> 5681.82]  based it's it's got a better processor and
[5681.82 --> 5683.74]  you can actually play games on it and it's
[5683.74 --> 5685.78]  only a hundred bucks yeah it looks that
[5685.78 --> 5688.86]  way how many Android so you do you you've
[5688.86 --> 5690.88]  been using your shield and everything to
[5690.88 --> 5694.22]  play games like you know like do you
[5694.22 --> 5697.38]  actually play any Android platform games
[5697.38 --> 5700.88]  or they're all rubbish yeah so I guess
[5700.88 --> 5703.20]  that would be my issue would be sure you
[5703.20 --> 5705.74]  can play Android games but I don't play
[5705.74 --> 5709.04]  any Android games so the draw really isn't
[5709.04 --> 5711.06]  there for me but I mean I don't know
[5711.06 --> 5713.68]  for $100 this is a tough sell for me I'd
[5713.68 --> 5715.28]  rather spend I think shield shield
[5715.28 --> 5717.22]  portables down to what 200 bucks now yeah
[5717.86 --> 5719.46]  yeah I'd rather have one of those and run
[5719.46 --> 5721.78]  it in console mode for sure you'd have a
[5721.78 --> 5723.70]  lot more flexibility with what you could
[5723.70 --> 5725.44]  play on it that's that's for damn sure
[5725.44 --> 5728.14]  yep so original article here is from New
[5728.14 --> 5733.60]  York Times and that is that HBO is to
[5733.60 --> 5735.94]  start their own standalone streaming
[5735.94 --> 5741.40]  service come 2015 which is I guess pretty
[5741.40 --> 5744.22]  cool actually very cool because now you
[5744.22 --> 5745.78]  won't have to have a cable subscription
[5745.78 --> 5749.86]  in order to get access to HBO programming
[5749.86 --> 5754.30]  so this intensifies their growing rivalry
[5754.30 --> 5760.00]  with Netflix HBO is trying to cater to the new generation that doesn't have any interest in cable
[5760.00 --> 5779.84]  subscriptions I have only had one when my cable provider offered it to me for free I watched hockey games that was it 10 million homes in the US have no cable or satellite subscription but do have internet half of those are subscribed to a streaming surface surface surface service so CEO of HBO says it's time to remove all barriers to
[5779.86 --> 5809.86]  those who don't have HBO all in there are 80 million homes in the US that do not have HBO and we will use all means at our disposal to go after them so there you go so there's there's that popular web comic I think it was from the oatmeal where somebody was like I'm going to watch games game of thrones but I want to do it legit stop cracking you sorry I want to do it legitimately and then there's the whole comic was about them trying to legitimately watch game of thrones and then eventually giving up and and pirating it and then it's not going to do it legitimately
[5809.86 --> 5811.84]  This is my only issue here.
[5811.94 --> 5814.30]  This is going to make that argument a lot more difficult.
[5814.50 --> 5817.30]  Anyone who pirates Game of Thrones regularly now,
[5817.54 --> 5820.02]  they have much less of an excuse.
[5821.82 --> 5825.76]  This, to me, signals the beginning of the end of cable TV.
[5826.50 --> 5827.02]  And world.
[5827.62 --> 5830.24]  Yeah, I don't understand why it still needs to exist.
[5830.56 --> 5832.44]  Kyle used a little bit more hyperbole there.
[5832.70 --> 5834.16]  Just a bit of embellishment.
[5834.76 --> 5836.80]  All right, we've got a few more rapid-fire topics,
[5836.94 --> 5839.08]  but I've got to go through these incredibly quickly
[5839.08 --> 5840.78]  because we've completely run out of time.
[5841.14 --> 5844.12]  Amazon to open a physical store in New York.
[5844.16 --> 5846.80]  It could act as a way to highlight products like Fire TV.
[5848.90 --> 5849.82]  This is a breakthrough.
[5850.00 --> 5852.48]  It's a revolutionary thing that Amazon has done here.
[5852.92 --> 5853.78]  Yeah, opening a store.
[5854.42 --> 5855.76]  Maybe Newegg will follow suit.
[5856.18 --> 5857.88]  And then maybe NCIX will open a retail...
[5857.88 --> 5859.10]  Oh, wait, no, they've already got them.
[5859.30 --> 5859.78]  They have them.
[5859.96 --> 5861.28]  They're called the Hybrid Center.
[5861.28 --> 5863.12]  They're like the hipsters of the tech industry.
[5863.58 --> 5865.98]  All right, Corsair RGB keyboards,
[5865.98 --> 5869.14]  allegedly only producing 512 colors.
[5869.56 --> 5872.98]  It is advertised as supporting 8-bit color,
[5873.14 --> 5875.94]  giving 16.8 million total color combinations.
[5876.14 --> 5879.18]  However, it's been found to support only 3-bit color,
[5879.54 --> 5881.24]  giving 512 combinations.
[5881.24 --> 5885.30]  To people who are sort of blown away by this,
[5885.38 --> 5891.58]  all I really have to say is Corsair is doing what they had to do here, I think.
[5891.66 --> 5892.60]  I don't think it's right.
[5892.68 --> 5898.28]  I don't think it's right for anyone to advertise 16.8 million RGB lighting in a product
[5898.28 --> 5902.94]  when it's obviously not actually 16.8 million color combinations.
[5902.94 --> 5905.34]  But like, let's take...
[5905.34 --> 5907.74]  Ugh, the cable's trapped under something here.
[5907.98 --> 5910.18]  Let's take this mouse, for example.
[5910.40 --> 5911.56]  This is a Logitech mouse.
[5911.74 --> 5914.58]  Logitech is a big company, a good company, good people.
[5916.06 --> 5918.70]  That LED lighting is advertised as 16.8 million.
[5919.18 --> 5920.22]  There's no way.
[5920.58 --> 5923.38]  There's no way in hell that it produces 16.8 million colors.
[5923.46 --> 5925.02]  If you guys have ever had an RGB product,
[5925.42 --> 5926.68]  drag the color wheel around.
[5927.52 --> 5929.06]  You know, take two yellows that are similar
[5929.06 --> 5931.46]  and see if you can actually see the difference in the LED.
[5931.46 --> 5935.32]  There is no difference because it doesn't actually do it.
[5935.74 --> 5937.06]  It's never actually done it.
[5937.24 --> 5941.28]  And if anything, Corsair's transitions much more smoothly,
[5941.60 --> 5945.26]  in my experience, than the Black Widow Ultimate Chroma anyway,
[5945.52 --> 5948.44]  and a lot more smoothly than a lot of other RGB products I've seen.
[5948.56 --> 5953.58]  So I really wonder how many colors most RGB products out there actually support.
[5954.00 --> 5955.58]  Like I said, still wrong.
[5955.80 --> 5956.82]  Shame on you, Corsair.
[5957.24 --> 5960.26]  But there you go.
[5960.26 --> 5961.82]  According to the forum users,
[5961.94 --> 5965.36]  the issue is either that they are constrained to the USB protocol
[5965.36 --> 5966.84]  that only supports three bits per channel,
[5967.04 --> 5971.48]  or because the three Panasonic A32-181 LED matrix ICs
[5971.48 --> 5972.58]  they use to control the keyboard
[5972.58 --> 5976.04]  are only able to give individual LEDs three bits of control per channel.
[5976.26 --> 5977.12]  So there you go.
[5977.62 --> 5979.96]  I don't think there's been an official statement from Corsair,
[5979.96 --> 5982.76]  but yeah.
[5983.34 --> 5985.62]  FutureMark launches the world's first 4K benchmark.
[5985.82 --> 5987.50]  This was posted by TechFanboy on the forum,
[5987.64 --> 5989.36]  and it's the sources from KitGuru.net.
[5989.84 --> 5992.56]  Firestrike Ultra renders the Firestrike benchmark in 4K.
[5992.64 --> 5994.72]  You need at least three gigs of VRAM to run the benchmark,
[5994.98 --> 5996.30]  and the leaderboards are live.
[5996.72 --> 5999.56]  There's a JBL special edition of the OnePlus One and earphones,
[5999.68 --> 6001.30]  but I don't really like talking about OnePlus One,
[6001.30 --> 6004.56]  because I think that they're 1 plus 1.
[6006.76 --> 6007.90]  It is what it is.
[6008.12 --> 6008.90]  1 plus 2.
[6009.88 --> 6011.10]  That equals 2.
[6011.88 --> 6012.94]  The answer to the equation.
[6014.32 --> 6017.28]  Apple patents flexible device display input method,
[6017.62 --> 6020.68]  so the device would react to bending using that as an input method.
[6020.84 --> 6021.24]  Very cool.
[6021.24 --> 6026.82]  Asus Strix mechanical keyboards with blue, black, brown, and red key switches
[6026.82 --> 6029.80]  are either available now or coming soon.
[6029.88 --> 6031.46]  I actually haven't seen if they're on sale yet.
[6031.54 --> 6033.08]  This was posted by Quertius.
[6033.76 --> 6036.42]  Oh, yeah, and the Apple patent thing was from TechDreamer.
[6036.82 --> 6038.70]  This was posted by Quertius on the forum,
[6038.94 --> 6041.32]  and this is the Strix Tactic Pro.
[6043.40 --> 6044.02]  There we go.
[6045.24 --> 6045.68]  Really?
[6045.68 --> 6048.76]  How is Asus and Corsair going to be buddy-buddy
[6048.76 --> 6051.02]  now that Asus has mice and keyboards?
[6051.24 --> 6052.20]  And headsets.
[6052.44 --> 6053.16]  And headsets.
[6054.04 --> 6056.66]  And I think they had cases at one point, didn't they?
[6057.76 --> 6060.40]  They have like, I know they have like server cases.
[6060.54 --> 6064.06]  They sell like, you know, kind of bare-bones server systems and stuff.
[6064.34 --> 6067.88]  I'm not sure if they have like mainstream consumer gamer cases
[6067.88 --> 6068.66]  or anything like that.
[6068.86 --> 6070.18]  I can't zoom in on this.
[6070.40 --> 6071.42]  I wouldn't be surprised if they did.
[6072.10 --> 6074.58]  Well, at any rate, it's a gaming keyboard.
[6074.58 --> 6075.22]  It's mechanical.
[6075.54 --> 6077.04]  It's got some macro keys on the left.
[6077.20 --> 6078.22]  Pricing looks reasonable.
[6078.34 --> 6079.48]  It's got N-key rollover.
[6079.48 --> 6083.28]  And it's got three more macro keys under the space bar,
[6083.36 --> 6086.10]  a position that I personally really, really like for them.
[6086.24 --> 6087.60]  Because whenever you're not jumping,
[6087.74 --> 6089.72]  you might as well be macro-ing something.
[6090.04 --> 6091.60]  And maybe more than one thing.
[6092.16 --> 6093.88]  And I think that's pretty much it for my topic.
[6093.88 --> 6098.24]  So I guess the rest here is, you know what?
[6098.30 --> 6100.74]  Actually, maybe, do you mind, do you guys mind if we end the show
[6100.74 --> 6103.40]  and then we come back immediately for a quick after party?
[6103.50 --> 6105.50]  Maybe you guys can update me on how things are going
[6105.50 --> 6107.72]  now that you're free from the shackles that bound you?
[6107.96 --> 6108.30]  Of course.
[6108.38 --> 6108.70]  Yeah, why not?
[6108.96 --> 6109.62]  Let's do that.
[6109.70 --> 6112.88]  So the after party will be back in like a couple seconds here.
[6112.88 --> 6142.86]  Thank you.
[6142.88 --> 6144.22]  for making our show possible.
[6145.14 --> 6146.00]  Real fist.
[6146.28 --> 6146.96]  All right, sponsors.
