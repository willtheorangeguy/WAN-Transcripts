[0.00 → 1.00] You're going.
[2.12 → 2.46] Okay.
[2.74 → 3.20] Uh, nope.
[3.36 → 3.78] Not that one.
[3.84 → 4.24] The other one.
[5.16 → 5.38] Chrome.
[6.54 → 10.96] And then, yeah, Chrome's stupid restore session that's just absolutely recent.
[11.10 → 12.68] Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[14.46 → 16.62] And just doesn't work sometimes.
[19.68 → 20.88] Wow, Chrome.
[21.32 → 22.62] You are so terrible.
[22.94 → 24.28] I just love you.
[25.28 → 27.12] I just love you to pieces.
[28.26 → 29.28] Recent tabs.
[29.28 → 30.06] None.
[31.38 → 34.98] It's like, yeah, I know the computer trash, but it's just like, really?
[35.62 → 36.28] Like, really?
[37.24 → 38.46] Like, oh, man.
[38.72 → 41.44] Them Black magic drivers, man.
[41.66 → 44.82] You know, we were doing real well for a bit.
[45.10 → 50.24] And the funny thing is that's even on their fancy, like, $1,000 or $2,000,
[50.64 → 53.28] however much it costs, like, 4K capture card.
[53.70 → 55.76] And it just, like, sometimes...
[55.76 → 57.80] Oh, no, no, no, because this was an HDMI one.
[57.80 → 59.08] No, it is on the Intensity Pro.
[59.08 → 63.56] Because sometimes it just outright, like, yeah, no, blue screen.
[63.72 → 64.02] Sorry.
[64.02 → 64.80] We're just going hot.
[65.34 → 66.22] So, let's see.
[66.72 → 67.20] All right.
[67.30 → 68.48] So, you know what, guys?
[68.54 → 77.48] I hate to kind of make you sit through this, but because it will take me about an extra 6 to 12 hours to have the WAN Show archive up,
[77.48 → 80.34] if we don't do...
[80.34 → 81.84] Like, if I cut it together afterward.
[82.02 → 83.32] There are a few reasons for that.
[83.68 → 85.00] And it's absolutely terrible.
[85.22 → 89.24] So, we're going to kind of just start over, and then we're going to nuke our first topic.
[89.38 → 90.20] So, we're going to do an extremely...
[90.20 → 90.38] Take two.
[91.18 → 92.34] ...extremely quick intro.
[93.12 → 94.76] Paid prioritization on the internet.
[95.72 → 98.86] Watchdogs is going to run at crappy resolutions, not on the PC.
[99.52 → 100.50] Knock to a fan.
[100.62 → 101.32] New one's coming.
[101.54 → 103.38] And Adaptive Sync is also coming.
[104.42 → 104.78] Boom.
[104.78 → 134.52] So, our sponsors today are Squarespace.org.
[134.78 → 137.66] The fast, easy way to create your own beautiful website.
[138.16 → 140.78] And Asus with the G750JZ.
[141.98 → 146.30] This laptop is so great that I use it with my mate.
[149.06 → 149.84] Don't hate.
[153.16 → 155.36] I can't rhyme in.
[155.38 → 156.76] Your response is too late.
[157.28 → 158.34] There you go.
[158.88 → 159.36] All right.
[159.48 → 161.78] So let's move on to our...
[161.78 → 164.12] Oh, I guess since it was one of our headline topics,
[164.12 → 166.18] we better at least sort of talk about it very briefly.
[166.72 → 169.14] So FCC approves internet fast lane.
[169.26 → 171.24] Basically, that's just a way of screwing over people
[171.24 → 173.58] who don't have the money to pay for the fast lane.
[173.86 → 174.68] You know what's funny?
[174.80 → 176.94] Actually, I guess we didn't talk about this last time around,
[177.06 → 179.64] but it really is like that.
[179.94 → 182.66] Because calling it an internet fast lane
[182.66 → 186.98] is actually the very best way to explain what it is.
[187.26 → 189.64] It is a way of making sure that the people
[189.64 → 191.66] who don't have way too much money
[191.66 → 193.64] so that they just don't even care anymore
[193.64 → 198.06] just all get stuck in like sitting in traffic
[198.06 → 199.34] and wasting their time.
[199.56 → 200.88] They're taking a three-lane highway
[200.88 → 203.40] and making it so that one of the lanes is paid for only.
[203.54 → 206.64] So the other two lanes have way too much traffic all the time.
[206.76 → 207.82] And then this one's awesome,
[208.02 → 209.20] but only has really rich people.
[209.36 → 210.44] I mean, the...
[210.44 → 211.34] So have you ever...
[211.34 → 212.20] Have you ever been to Toronto?
[213.78 → 215.18] For like half an hour.
[215.18 → 217.18] Okay, so Toronto has...
[217.76 → 220.10] Basically, they have like two kinds of...
[220.10 → 222.90] Not quite, but like two somewhat equivalent highways.
[223.46 → 225.18] And one of them is a toll highway.
[225.62 → 229.40] And the other one is the sit and don't move highway.
[229.40 → 233.38] And the toll highway is so expensive
[233.38 → 235.10] because you actually...
[235.10 → 236.32] You get told when you get on
[236.32 → 239.98] and then it actually keeps track of how far you go
[239.98 → 243.96] and then tolls you like based on how far you went at the exit.
[243.96 → 248.82] And the way they enforce this is it's all cameras.
[249.34 → 250.00] But get this.
[250.04 → 251.32] If you try to dodge the toll,
[251.78 → 252.60] they'll actually...
[252.60 → 256.52] They keep records of all the vehicles matching a given description.
[257.02 → 259.44] And when they catch you, they look for patterns.
[260.00 → 261.28] And when they catch you,
[261.48 → 263.64] they hit you with the entire bill plus interest.
[264.12 → 265.74] So like it's absolutely brutal.
[265.90 → 266.96] And basically, I remember...
[267.60 → 268.10] I forget.
[268.24 → 270.42] I forget how much it costs.
[270.72 → 271.74] But I was there.
[271.74 → 275.96] And I worked it out.
[276.02 → 279.82] And it was something like an hour of your wage per day
[279.82 → 281.98] if you were making like okay money
[281.98 → 284.36] just to get to and from work.
[284.48 → 285.86] Aside from gas.
[286.02 → 287.04] Aside from insurance.
[287.42 → 291.36] Which of course the local government is also collecting taxes on.
[292.10 → 292.50] Yeah.
[293.02 → 294.68] It's just absolutely brutal.
[295.10 → 295.92] That's nasty.
[296.10 → 297.78] So that is what a fast lane is.
[297.92 → 300.06] A fast lane is a way of saying
[300.06 → 302.16] you got lots of money?
[302.68 → 303.78] All right, man.
[303.96 → 305.30] You don't get lots of money?
[306.10 → 306.78] You can go.
[306.84 → 309.78] Get in that one highway that doesn't move ever.
[310.02 → 311.06] Yeah, pretty much.
[311.18 → 311.54] Okay.
[311.86 → 312.28] Okay.
[312.52 → 315.76] So this is pretty fantastic.
[316.02 → 319.00] This was posted originally on the forum by Death Jester.
[319.14 → 321.14] We're going to go ahead and share my screen here.
[322.02 → 322.54] Watchdogs.
[322.62 → 324.48] The Watchdogs Experience.
[324.48 → 325.56] So okay.
[325.78 → 327.54] So here's a quote from the article
[327.54 → 329.14] which was on the Ubisoft blog.
[329.74 → 330.92] Our next gen system
[330.92 → 332.30] or on next gen systems
[332.30 → 335.24] the game will run at 900p on PS4
[335.24 → 337.08] which actually is not that bad.
[337.64 → 340.10] Upscaled 900p is not that bad.
[340.80 → 341.50] That's what?
[341.58 → 344.00] Like 80% of the resolution of 1080p-ish?
[344.26 → 345.80] It's still not 1080p
[345.80 → 347.70] and 1080p is kind of meh.
[348.22 → 349.04] On a TV though.
[349.12 → 350.04] Remember, you're playing on a TV.
[350.22 → 350.38] That's true.
[350.44 → 351.96] So 1080p is like as good as it gets.
[351.96 → 354.70] Not everyone plays these on TVs.
[355.28 → 355.76] That's true.
[355.84 → 357.40] But you're still playing on a 1080p display.
[357.68 → 359.10] Especially like dorm room people.
[359.22 → 359.36] Yeah.
[359.52 → 359.68] Yeah.
[359.68 → 359.96] That's true.
[360.04 → 360.22] Okay.
[360.42 → 361.98] So you're playing at 1080p.
[362.02 → 363.24] So 900p, not that bad.
[363.48 → 367.40] It's going to run at 792p on the Xbox One.
[370.54 → 372.60] What is 792p?
[373.82 → 376.66] Like they're just inventing things.
[378.12 → 380.82] It's probably the highest they could get
[380.82 → 381.82] that sits at 30fps.
[381.82 → 384.50] Yeah, but it's better than 790p.
[384.66 → 386.46] Why didn't you go with 790p?
[386.56 → 387.82] Why not 793p?
[387.82 → 389.44] The highest they could possibly get
[389.44 → 391.08] where it sits stable at 30fps.
[391.16 → 391.84] I bet you that was it.
[392.00 → 393.62] It runs at 30 frames per second
[393.62 → 395.32] on both consoles.
[396.04 → 398.84] And basically what Ubisoft had to say
[398.84 → 400.52] is while some new gen games
[400.52 → 401.82] now offer native 1080p,
[402.76 → 403.98] it was much more important
[403.98 → 406.40] to deliver an amazing next gen experience
[406.40 → 407.96] than to push a few more pixels
[407.96 → 408.80] onto the screen.
[408.80 → 409.52] And this is a quote.
[410.08 → 411.52] Resolution is a number
[411.52 → 413.54] just like frame rate is a number.
[413.54 → 423.38] Oh no.
[423.60 → 425.20] Resolution is not just a number.
[425.64 → 427.60] Resolution is one part
[427.60 → 429.34] of the overall visual fidelity,
[429.72 → 431.02] but that assumes
[431.02 → 432.32] that the resolution
[432.32 → 435.44] is at a reasonable enough level
[435.44 → 437.82] that it's not detracting
[437.82 → 438.76] from the experience.
[438.76 → 441.16] Experience is a word.
[442.80 → 444.66] Just like how gameplay is a word.
[450.26 → 451.50] How did I ever do this show
[451.50 → 451.96] without you?
[453.76 → 455.46] Oh right, less expensively.
[457.38 → 458.76] You don't pay me for the whole show.
[459.00 → 460.16] And actually at the beginning
[460.16 → 460.92] when I first came on
[460.92 → 461.86] you didn't pay me for the show
[461.86 → 464.62] at all for like a year and a half
[464.62 → 465.12] or something.
[465.62 → 467.66] I don't think it was a year and a half.
[467.66 → 468.14] No.
[468.38 → 469.48] I don't know when it was.
[469.56 → 471.84] It was a year and two months.
[471.86 → 473.52] I think that a year
[473.52 → 475.42] is just a period of time.
[479.90 → 480.78] Oh no.
[481.46 → 482.46] Oh man.
[483.44 → 485.38] So, okay guys.
[485.54 → 486.96] This is the problem with this.
[487.06 → 488.46] Okay, look at it this way.
[488.64 → 490.04] When you're playing a game
[490.04 → 491.38] like Battlefield 4
[491.38 → 493.04] where it's available on the PC,
[493.04 → 495.04] it's available on the PlayStation 4,
[495.18 → 496.88] it's available on the Xbox 360,
[496.88 → 498.34] it's available on all these platforms,
[498.54 → 499.94] that gives you an opportunity
[499.94 → 502.96] to evaluate the importance
[502.96 → 505.44] of gaming hardware.
[505.84 → 506.48] And you know what?
[506.56 → 507.58] I think when you and I
[507.58 → 508.70] were doing our evaluation
[508.70 → 510.68] with the next gen versus last gen
[510.68 → 511.92] versus entry level PC,
[512.44 → 513.44] we pretty much agreed.
[513.62 → 514.98] PlayStation 4, you know what?
[515.04 → 516.04] Not a bad value.
[516.22 → 516.32] Yeah.
[516.66 → 517.54] The difference,
[518.06 → 519.84] this was Assassin's Creed at the time
[519.84 → 521.36] and that was running at 900p
[521.36 → 522.24] at the time, wasn't it?
[522.24 → 523.90] I think so.
[523.98 → 524.96] It was something like that.
[525.02 → 525.60] I can look it up.
[525.64 → 527.30] It was 720p on,
[527.30 → 529.28] it was 720p on Xbox One for sure.
[529.28 → 529.66] On Xbox One, yeah.
[529.80 → 531.48] And I think we could agree,
[531.78 → 533.22] and just jump in
[533.22 → 533.92] if I'm saying things
[533.92 → 534.74] that are totally unfair,
[534.86 → 535.90] but I think we could agree
[535.90 → 537.52] that PlayStation 4
[537.52 → 539.42] looked a hell of a lot closer
[539.42 → 540.58] to the entry level PC.
[540.76 → 541.90] Like basically...
[541.90 → 542.60] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[542.64 → 543.76] Sitting a distance away from...
[543.76 → 545.38] But the Xbox One experience,
[545.56 → 547.64] because the resolution was so low,
[548.08 → 549.30] even though maybe they're running
[549.30 → 550.56] similar detail levels
[550.56 → 551.46] and they've got the same
[551.46 → 552.28] physics simulations
[552.28 → 553.64] and all that gameplay stuff
[553.64 → 554.76] that is really important,
[555.10 → 556.68] the resolution was so low
[556.68 → 559.36] that it detracted from the experience.
[559.48 → 561.08] It was very noticeable.
[561.60 → 563.80] It was obvious
[563.80 → 565.02] and your eyes kind of went,
[565.18 → 566.64] oh, like crap.
[566.80 → 567.58] Like this would look good
[567.58 → 568.58] if it wasn't for...
[568.58 → 568.78] Ugh.
[569.20 → 569.36] Yeah.
[569.72 → 571.48] People are saying 1080p now,
[571.60 → 572.24] but I think there was an update.
[572.24 → 573.26] It is 1080p now.
[573.36 → 574.14] I think there was an update.
[574.32 → 574.46] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[575.04 → 576.06] No, there was an update.
[576.06 → 577.76] So the point is that
[577.76 → 579.78] up to a certain point,
[580.20 → 581.54] resolution's just a number.
[582.00 → 584.20] And when your TV is going to be,
[584.32 → 585.76] you know, 20 feet away from you
[585.76 → 586.78] or something like that,
[587.16 → 588.84] 1080p versus 4K,
[589.02 → 590.76] you may not even be able to tell.
[590.82 → 591.72] Depending on the screen size
[591.72 → 592.20] and stuff too.
[592.22 → 593.24] Depending on screen size,
[593.34 → 594.14] depending on distance,
[594.30 → 595.22] depending on content.
[595.38 → 595.54] Yeah.
[595.72 → 599.82] But 1080p versus 360p,
[600.40 → 601.46] you'd be able to tell.
[601.66 → 601.90] Yeah.
[601.96 → 603.76] And then like 1080p versus like,
[604.02 → 604.34] you know,
[604.34 → 605.52] whatever the lowest one,
[605.52 → 606.70] like is it like 144
[606.70 → 607.88] or like whatever,
[608.46 → 610.94] like lowest vertical line resolution,
[611.18 → 613.26] is going to be distracting
[613.26 → 614.56] and terrible.
[615.06 → 615.50] And I,
[615.84 → 617.06] in my mind,
[617.38 → 618.82] 792p,
[618.98 → 620.22] for something that we're gonna call
[620.22 → 621.72] a next-gen gaming experience,
[622.30 → 624.78] I understand what they're doing,
[625.00 → 626.88] but it's a totally unacceptable
[626.88 → 629.02] gaming experience in my mind.
[629.12 → 629.60] But,
[630.30 → 632.22] I don't blame Ubisoft for this
[632.22 → 633.28] at all.
[633.32 → 634.26] Nope, not their fault.
[634.26 → 635.26] In fact,
[635.76 → 636.56] Ubisoft,
[637.26 → 638.32] I'm going to do this.
[640.12 → 640.64] You know why?
[640.64 → 641.46] They pushed the experience
[641.46 → 642.34] that they needed to push.
[642.64 → 643.18] That's right.
[643.60 → 644.70] And on the platforms
[644.70 → 645.94] that can do it,
[646.16 → 646.88] they're going to deliver
[646.88 → 647.48] that experience.
[647.78 → 649.02] They had the balls
[649.02 → 649.70] to say,
[650.00 → 650.30] look,
[650.40 → 651.94] we're going to make an awesome game
[651.94 → 653.06] that looks fantastic
[653.06 → 655.02] and has a bunch of really cool features.
[655.32 → 655.82] And it does.
[655.90 → 656.58] And you know what?
[657.02 → 658.00] If people don't buy
[658.00 → 658.76] the right hardware,
[659.72 → 660.26] fine.
[661.06 → 661.84] Then they're going to get
[661.84 → 662.70] a lesser experience
[662.70 → 663.04] and like,
[663.12 → 663.62] we're sorry,
[664.02 → 664.40] but like,
[664.46 → 665.50] we did our best, man.
[665.74 → 666.60] We did our best
[666.60 → 668.24] and deal with it.
[668.44 → 668.72] Honestly,
[668.88 → 670.02] the stuff Ubisoft's been
[670.02 → 670.72] pushing out lately
[670.72 → 671.38] has been really cool.
[671.46 → 672.16] Other than Play,
[672.24 → 673.48] Play's terrible.
[673.64 → 674.44] Yeah, Play is terrible.
[674.44 → 675.60] You're terrible.
[676.06 → 676.44] But like,
[676.54 → 677.16] the games have been
[677.16 → 677.56] This live stream
[677.56 → 678.56] brought to you by Ubisoft.
[678.62 → 679.16] Play's terrible.
[679.28 → 679.64] Oh, wait,
[679.70 → 679.96] hold on.
[680.24 → 681.20] Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[681.86 → 683.00] One actually fairly
[683.00 → 683.62] interesting thing
[683.62 → 684.84] is Mario Kart 8
[684.84 → 685.64] on Wii U
[685.64 → 686.20] is going to be
[686.20 → 686.78] 1080p,
[686.86 → 687.24] 60 FPS.
[687.24 → 687.72] Hold on, hold on.
[687.76 → 688.22] This is great.
[688.48 → 688.94] This guy's like,
[689.10 → 690.24] Linus is such a suck-up
[690.24 → 690.80] sometimes.
[691.12 → 691.38] And then,
[691.54 → 692.48] he probably hasn't seen
[692.48 → 693.32] the part of the stream yet.
[693.32 → 694.16] Play is terrible.
[694.26 → 695.68] Yeah, Play is awful.
[696.30 → 697.12] Terrible.
[697.14 → 698.14] Yeah, Play is awful.
[698.16 → 699.54] Very possibly the worst one.
[699.60 → 701.12] What I think Ubisoft should do
[701.12 → 702.74] is they should just like,
[703.06 → 704.68] make a deal with Valve
[704.68 → 705.92] where they can have
[705.92 → 707.24] their own Play,
[707.44 → 708.22] but they can just
[708.22 → 708.78] skin Steam.
[709.00 → 709.96] A section on Steam?
[710.14 → 710.32] Yeah.
[710.36 → 711.22] Like, there's the Play
[711.22 → 712.18] section on Steam?
[712.18 → 713.30] No, Valve should just
[713.30 → 714.34] sell them a license
[714.34 → 714.98] for Steam.
[716.06 → 717.00] No way.
[717.10 → 718.18] That would be so good.
[718.20 → 718.98] That would be awesome.
[719.10 → 719.76] That would be awesome.
[719.94 → 720.88] If anyone from Valve
[720.88 → 721.42] is watching,
[721.62 → 722.18] please,
[722.46 → 723.30] rescue them.
[723.64 → 723.98] Let's do it.
[724.02 → 725.14] You know that they need
[725.14 → 726.20] to have their own thing
[726.20 → 727.14] so they can feel like
[727.14 → 727.74] big boys.
[727.98 → 729.16] Like, they have their
[729.16 → 730.76] online content distribution
[730.76 → 731.12] thing.
[731.56 → 732.54] Let them build their own,
[732.54 → 733.42] You can still make money
[733.42 → 733.64] off of it.
[733.64 → 734.44] Yeah, you can still
[734.44 → 735.28] make money off of it
[735.28 → 735.70] this way.
[735.94 → 736.98] Just let them license it
[736.98 → 737.96] so they can feel like
[737.96 → 739.06] they're doing their own thing.
[740.26 → 741.00] Everyone's a winner.
[741.44 → 741.80] Everybody.
[742.26 → 742.94] Everyone's a winner
[742.94 → 744.70] because it's so much
[744.70 → 745.48] better than Origin
[745.48 → 746.08] and Play.
[746.50 → 746.78] And then,
[746.84 → 747.68] and then maybe part
[747.68 → 749.14] of the license contract
[749.14 → 750.56] can be that
[750.56 → 751.80] browser-based,
[751.94 → 752.34] what's that,
[752.46 → 753.04] Battle log?
[753.04 → 754.56] Battle log has to go away.
[754.92 → 755.36] Yes.
[755.52 → 756.98] Oh, man.
[757.04 → 758.34] I would be so happy.
[758.56 → 759.96] Valve can rescue us all.
[760.46 → 761.24] Valve can literally
[761.24 → 762.50] save the whole universe.
[762.56 → 762.90] Okay, I'm sorry.
[762.94 → 763.52] You were talking about
[763.52 → 764.64] Mario Kart and how
[764.64 → 766.42] Nintendo is going to be
[766.42 → 766.70] delivered.
[767.10 → 767.54] Nintendo,
[767.92 → 768.96] Mario Kart 8
[768.96 → 769.76] on Wii U.
[769.76 → 770.48] 1080p,
[770.62 → 771.34] 60fps,
[771.54 → 772.54] including split-screen
[772.54 → 773.02] multiplayer.
[773.56 → 774.28] They're just like,
[774.40 → 774.66] nope,
[774.90 → 775.56] it needs to be
[775.56 → 776.28] in this experience.
[776.38 → 777.56] And it looks perfect
[777.56 → 778.50] and it has new features
[778.50 → 779.18] and all this kind of stuff
[779.18 → 779.58] and boom,
[779.76 → 779.86] done.
[779.86 → 780.46] I mean,
[780.52 → 781.98] part of Nintendo's thing,
[782.42 → 783.64] I think they benefit
[783.64 → 784.42] from resolution
[784.42 → 786.36] more than other guys
[786.36 → 788.60] because their graphical style,
[788.68 → 789.46] it's kind of like Blizzard
[789.46 → 791.22] where they're just like,
[791.38 → 791.66] okay,
[791.78 → 793.04] we're going to make stuff
[793.04 → 794.42] that's really easy to run
[794.42 → 795.50] and then we're going to
[795.50 → 797.36] call that a graphical style.
[797.70 → 797.80] Yeah,
[797.82 → 798.80] but it looks perfect.
[798.84 → 799.42] But it works.
[799.56 → 799.70] Yeah.
[799.82 → 801.24] That cartoon style works.
[802.12 → 802.66] I mean,
[802.68 → 803.58] that's not going to help
[803.58 → 806.42] Nintendo stop losing money.
[806.66 → 806.80] No.
[806.80 → 808.46] And it's not going to help
[808.46 → 809.54] Watch Dogs in any way.
[809.74 → 809.96] No,
[810.20 → 810.84] because Watch Dogs
[810.84 → 811.82] is not a cartoon style.
[811.84 → 812.08] That's great.
[812.14 → 812.90] Who's this on Twitch?
[815.68 → 816.16] Adalvalant.
[816.42 → 818.32] Battle log is so much fun.
[818.42 → 818.52] Yeah,
[818.54 → 819.92] it's basically its own game.
[820.38 → 821.14] The game is...
[821.14 → 821.94] Can you make it work?
[821.96 → 822.92] Press the button
[822.92 → 824.60] and find out if it works.
[824.78 → 826.02] It's like playing slots,
[826.24 → 826.60] you know?
[828.82 → 829.88] Every time someone
[829.88 → 830.80] wants to play Battlefield
[830.80 → 831.44] with me,
[831.48 → 832.20] I'm like,
[832.42 → 833.10] let's see
[833.10 → 834.68] because I don't know.
[835.04 → 835.88] And half the time
[835.88 → 836.24] it's like,
[836.34 → 836.56] nope,
[836.56 → 837.20] can't play.
[837.30 → 837.52] Okay,
[837.64 → 838.04] good luck.
[838.14 → 838.54] Have fun.
[839.30 → 839.62] Oh,
[839.80 → 840.50] fantastic.
[840.70 → 841.32] Someone wants to know
[841.32 → 842.52] what are the after market buds
[842.52 → 843.48] on my IE80s?
[843.64 → 844.02] Nothing.
[844.28 → 846.04] These are just stock IE80s
[846.04 → 846.58] and I love them.
[846.66 → 847.06] They're amazing.
[847.34 → 847.88] They're my favourite.
[847.98 → 849.16] They're my favourite earphones ever.
[850.24 → 851.28] Not because Sennheiser
[851.28 → 852.16] paid me to say that.
[852.22 → 852.56] In fact,
[852.62 → 853.86] my relationship with Sennheiser
[853.86 → 855.90] has been very rocky at times,
[855.90 → 857.48] but I definitely do love
[857.48 → 858.02] their products.
[858.42 → 859.30] What are those tips
[859.30 → 860.10] that we used to use?
[860.34 → 860.70] Comply.
[860.90 → 861.10] Yeah,
[861.20 → 861.76] those were nice.
[861.86 → 863.04] Comply actually reached out.
[863.12 → 864.06] They want us to do a review.
[864.58 → 865.50] And I was just kind of like,
[865.58 → 866.50] how do you do a review?
[866.50 → 867.32] A review of a piece of foam
[867.32 → 868.32] that goes on the end of it.
[868.54 → 868.78] Yeah.
[869.06 → 870.60] We could do like a 30-second review.
[870.68 → 871.32] We could do a review
[871.32 → 872.02] of just the tip,
[872.08 → 872.34] I guess.
[874.24 → 875.56] We don't want the whole thing.
[875.62 → 876.08] They're good,
[876.24 → 877.20] but they break down
[877.20 → 878.38] and then you have to buy new ones
[878.38 → 879.24] and it gets expensive.
[879.24 → 879.64] Yeah.
[879.64 → 880.12] When you're done.
[880.12 → 880.66] I mean,
[880.74 → 882.38] Easel buys them,
[882.50 → 883.64] but my whole thing was
[883.64 → 884.74] I don't want to get hooked
[884.74 → 887.00] because I cannot,
[887.76 → 888.12] okay,
[888.54 → 889.64] I can afford
[889.64 → 891.50] to buy foam tips,
[891.78 → 893.80] but I would feel stupid.
[894.22 → 894.42] Yeah.
[894.78 → 895.26] Yeah.
[895.40 → 896.12] It's not like
[896.12 → 897.84] that much money,
[898.00 → 898.70] but it just seems like
[898.70 → 899.18] an investment
[899.18 → 899.76] where you're like,
[899.88 → 900.30] wow,
[900.60 → 902.08] do I really need to do this?
[902.08 → 904.10] I'm locking into this commitment,
[904.10 → 905.66] but you know what?
[905.76 → 907.06] In the grand scheme of things,
[907.06 → 908.34] they do sound better
[908.34 → 910.10] and they are way more comfortable.
[910.40 → 910.86] They're way more comfortable.
[911.08 → 911.76] If they had like
[911.76 → 913.16] a subscription service,
[913.22 → 914.30] as stupid as this sounds.
[914.30 → 915.36] They should have one though.
[915.36 → 915.98] They should have one.
[916.64 → 918.16] Solent has a subscription service.
[918.22 → 918.38] Yeah.
[918.44 → 918.60] Like,
[918.70 → 918.86] well,
[918.94 → 919.24] I mean,
[919.24 → 920.02] one of our sponsors,
[920.18 → 920.80] Dollar Shave Club.
[921.00 → 921.12] Like,
[921.96 → 922.88] if you told,
[922.98 → 923.84] if Dollar Shave Club
[923.84 → 924.36] came to us
[924.36 → 924.72] and they're like,
[924.82 → 925.04] yeah,
[925.34 → 926.62] we have this great idea.
[926.82 → 928.22] You're going to buy razors online.
[928.66 → 929.26] I'd be like,
[929.48 → 929.78] wow,
[929.92 → 930.48] you're an idiot.
[930.70 → 931.70] That's a terrible idea.
[931.72 → 932.72] That's a terrible idea.
[932.72 → 934.42] But the whole subscription model
[934.42 → 936.12] makes it actually work really well
[936.12 → 937.58] because you're committing
[937.58 → 939.14] a small amount of money
[939.14 → 941.32] spread out over a long period of time
[941.32 → 942.58] and then you don't have to think about it
[942.58 → 943.08] because to me,
[943.16 → 943.98] it's really about the hassle.
[944.40 → 945.10] I'll tell you what,
[945.40 → 947.08] if anyone from Comply is watching,
[947.40 → 948.86] if you guys figure out
[948.86 → 949.86] a subscription model
[949.86 → 950.52] where like,
[950.52 → 952.04] I just get a new set of tips
[952.04 → 952.72] once a quarter
[952.72 → 953.78] or something like that
[953.78 → 954.96] and it's inexpensive
[954.96 → 955.86] and like,
[955.88 → 956.48] I get a discount
[956.48 → 957.38] for being like,
[957.56 → 958.30] part of the club.
[958.46 → 959.00] Kind of like what,
[959.08 → 959.28] again,
[959.34 → 960.12] one of our other sponsors,
[960.24 → 960.72] Five4,
[960.90 → 962.26] where they take their store
[962.26 → 963.46] and they basically go,
[963.56 → 963.64] okay,
[963.68 → 963.92] look,
[963.98 → 965.08] you sign up for the subscription
[965.08 → 966.92] and you have half price
[966.92 → 967.96] off of MSRP
[967.96 → 969.58] and we send it to you once a month.
[969.66 → 969.78] Like,
[969.84 → 970.80] if Comply figures out
[970.80 → 971.66] something like that
[971.66 → 973.74] where they get the commitment from me
[973.74 → 975.04] so they can rely on the business
[975.04 → 976.36] and I get a discount
[976.36 → 977.28] and the convenience,
[977.90 → 978.74] I will commit
[978.74 → 980.28] and I will start using Comply tips.
[980.28 → 981.00] That's my deal.
[981.00 → 982.10] Solent recently came out
[982.10 → 982.60] of their like,
[982.72 → 983.26] beta phase
[983.26 → 984.44] and they're now selling normally.
[984.84 → 985.70] Beta food.
[985.86 → 986.32] I know.
[986.44 → 987.82] With the way beta tests go,
[987.92 → 988.28] like...
[988.84 → 989.20] Well,
[989.26 → 990.90] they have FCC approved,
[991.14 → 992.00] even though that's still
[992.00 → 992.70] kind of sketchy,
[992.76 → 993.32] but they do have
[993.32 → 994.28] a nutritional label now
[994.28 → 994.92] and all that kind of stuff,
[994.98 → 995.50] so that's kind of good.
[995.56 → 997.30] They have a nutritional label.
[998.14 → 999.30] But nutritional labels
[999.30 → 1000.02] are just numbers.
[1000.02 → 1003.76] This is not going to end
[1003.76 → 1004.06] like,
[1004.16 → 1004.48] ever.
[1006.58 → 1007.68] We need a t-shirt.
[1008.30 → 1009.50] Resolution is just a number.
[1009.74 → 1010.60] And then it should be all like,
[1010.66 → 1011.90] pixelated and shitty looking.
[1012.46 → 1012.82] Yeah,
[1012.98 → 1014.38] that's actually not a bad idea.
[1014.70 → 1015.04] Guys,
[1015.14 → 1016.42] let us know if we need to do that.
[1016.48 → 1016.86] You know what?
[1016.92 → 1017.48] I'm going to,
[1017.48 → 1017.92] I'm going to,
[1017.96 → 1019.60] I'm going to just jump on this.
[1019.98 → 1020.22] We,
[1020.30 → 1021.72] we have to make that t-shirt.
[1022.22 → 1022.72] Need a
[1022.72 → 1025.76] resolution is just a number t-shirt.
[1025.96 → 1027.08] Resolution is just a number,
[1027.56 → 1028.22] just like...
[1028.22 → 1028.54] Yeah,
[1028.84 → 1031.50] and the text should look crappy
[1031.50 → 1032.34] and low res.
[1032.62 → 1032.86] Okay,
[1032.94 → 1034.20] I'm sending that to Easel.
[1034.28 → 1035.26] I'm trying to think of some way
[1035.26 → 1036.00] that you can include
[1036.00 → 1037.62] just like FPS is just a number.
[1037.98 → 1038.24] It's,
[1038.24 → 1039.02] it'll be too long.
[1039.08 → 1039.62] It would be too,
[1039.62 → 1040.84] it would be too long for one.
[1040.84 → 1041.20] Too long.
[1041.26 → 1041.70] And then for two,
[1041.78 → 1042.78] the only way that I can think of
[1042.78 → 1043.88] that you could style it properly
[1043.88 → 1045.50] would be like lagging the word,
[1045.64 → 1046.22] the letters out.
[1046.34 → 1046.52] Yeah.
[1046.52 → 1047.42] And that would just look really weird.
[1047.44 → 1047.70] Yeah.
[1047.90 → 1048.28] And like,
[1048.34 → 1049.42] if you want the words
[1049.42 → 1050.56] to be low res enough
[1050.56 → 1051.66] to kind of get the joke,
[1051.76 → 1052.70] it's going to have to be pretty big.
[1052.72 → 1053.46] They'll take up space
[1053.46 → 1054.68] so you can actually read it and stuff.
[1054.76 → 1054.96] So yeah,
[1055.04 → 1056.54] resolution is just a number t-shirt.
[1056.66 → 1056.94] We're going to,
[1056.98 → 1057.62] we're going to get on that,
[1057.66 → 1057.98] you guys.
[1058.26 → 1058.48] Yeah.
[1058.68 → 1060.64] I'm sorry our t-shirt supply chain
[1060.64 → 1061.32] takes so long.
[1061.40 → 1062.70] We're looking into some other options.
[1063.04 → 1063.36] Um,
[1063.38 → 1064.76] so stay tuned on that,
[1064.80 → 1065.14] you guys.
[1065.28 → 1065.50] Yeah.
[1066.10 → 1066.46] But yeah,
[1066.46 → 1067.00] so they,
[1067.00 → 1068.82] they win subscription service recently
[1068.82 → 1070.52] and I think that's really smart
[1070.52 → 1071.42] because a big problem
[1071.42 → 1072.26] with that whole thing.
[1072.34 → 1072.48] Sorry,
[1072.54 → 1073.70] we're back to talking about Solent.
[1073.74 → 1073.88] Yeah.
[1073.88 → 1074.46] I've lost track.
[1074.60 → 1075.88] I had to think about it for a second.
[1075.98 → 1076.88] What is he talking about?
[1077.50 → 1077.82] Uh,
[1077.90 → 1078.04] yeah,
[1078.22 → 1078.40] Solent.
[1078.56 → 1079.50] Subscription condoms?
[1080.12 → 1081.18] That probably exists.
[1081.18 → 1082.08] It probably does.
[1082.18 → 1083.50] It would make you feel really,
[1083.50 → 1084.58] like,
[1084.70 → 1085.92] wouldn't it make you feel crappy
[1085.92 → 1087.28] when you start to get a stockpile
[1087.28 → 1087.68] and you'd be like,
[1087.78 → 1087.96] oh,
[1088.04 → 1088.20] I'm not doing.
[1088.20 → 1088.74] Oh no.
[1090.04 → 1091.34] I'm not doing very well here.
[1092.62 → 1093.02] There's,
[1093.16 → 1093.56] you know,
[1093.56 → 1094.80] you know how I sometimes try and find,
[1094.92 → 1094.98] like,
[1095.02 → 1095.98] people that want to do pre-rolls
[1095.98 → 1096.58] and stuff like that?
[1097.02 → 1097.38] Um,
[1097.48 → 1097.62] I,
[1097.76 → 1098.98] I was watching a
[1099.04 → 1099.14] yeah,
[1099.18 → 1099.94] this is going to go there.
[1100.24 → 1100.56] Um,
[1100.56 → 1102.56] I was watching an old archive
[1102.56 → 1104.94] of one of the Young Turks videos
[1104.94 → 1106.14] on some topic.
[1106.26 → 1107.64] I don't even remember why I was watching it,
[1107.94 → 1109.38] but their sponsor for the video
[1109.38 → 1110.60] was some condom website.
[1110.60 → 1111.94] And I thought about it
[1111.94 → 1113.32] and I'd like written the email
[1113.32 → 1113.80] being like,
[1113.84 → 1114.78] maybe we should contact them
[1114.78 → 1115.22] and I was like,
[1115.54 → 1116.36] no.
[1116.78 → 1117.28] Because I was like,
[1117.34 → 1117.44] well,
[1117.48 → 1118.30] our target audience
[1118.30 → 1119.48] would be so big for them.
[1120.78 → 1121.14] Wait,
[1121.20 → 1122.42] because they all have large penises?
[1122.82 → 1123.12] Well,
[1123.22 → 1123.52] I mean,
[1123.86 → 1124.70] you probably do,
[1124.80 → 1124.88] but.
[1124.88 → 1125.12] Yeah,
[1125.28 → 1127.72] but I meant more the male side.
[1127.98 → 1128.38] Yeah,
[1128.84 → 1129.68] we should totally do it.
[1129.70 → 1130.02] Why not?
[1130.34 → 1130.78] I did,
[1130.84 → 1131.92] I wasn't a huge fan of the website.
[1132.08 → 1132.28] Oh,
[1132.32 → 1132.50] okay.
[1132.50 → 1133.94] If it was like a better service
[1133.94 → 1134.94] or a better website,
[1135.06 → 1135.72] then I probably would have
[1135.72 → 1136.46] actually sent the email,
[1136.60 → 1137.00] but it was,
[1137.20 → 1138.08] okay.
[1138.08 → 1138.20] Okay.
[1138.20 → 1138.56] Okay.
[1138.68 → 1138.86] Yeah.
[1138.86 → 1139.74] Because if we can find,
[1139.84 → 1140.12] I guess,
[1140.46 → 1140.66] well,
[1140.70 → 1141.46] there's the challenge.
[1141.46 → 1143.66] If we can find a not sketch.
[1144.12 → 1144.38] Yeah.
[1145.00 → 1146.30] Online condom seller.
[1146.56 → 1146.84] Well,
[1146.94 → 1149.10] like Durex wouldn't be sketched,
[1149.24 → 1150.32] but then it would have to be
[1150.32 → 1151.42] like a subscription service
[1151.42 → 1152.46] to them or whatever.
[1152.54 → 1152.94] Yeah.
[1153.08 → 1153.54] And like,
[1153.54 → 1154.48] I don't know if that's going to work,
[1154.54 → 1155.16] but anyway,
[1155.36 → 1156.74] back to Solent again.
[1157.10 → 1157.32] Yes.
[1157.32 → 1157.62] Um,
[1157.62 → 1159.00] my biggest problem with it
[1159.00 → 1160.24] is like the second you run out,
[1160.32 → 1160.60] you're like,
[1160.72 → 1161.08] okay,
[1161.16 → 1161.28] well,
[1161.28 → 1161.88] I'm going to have to wait
[1161.88 → 1162.84] two weeks or something
[1162.84 → 1164.02] until I get more.
[1164.34 → 1164.62] Right.
[1164.62 → 1166.12] Time to not be using this
[1166.12 → 1166.52] for a while.
[1166.62 → 1166.78] Right.
[1166.82 → 1167.60] Because then you can't,
[1167.72 → 1169.74] you can never be on cycle properly.
[1169.86 → 1171.22] Can you ever actually test it?
[1171.42 → 1171.58] Yeah,
[1171.64 → 1172.02] exactly.
[1172.14 → 1173.60] So now they actually have
[1173.60 → 1174.86] a subscription thing.
[1174.92 → 1175.66] You can sign up for a month
[1175.66 → 1176.42] or whatever weeks,
[1176.44 → 1176.88] or I don't know.
[1176.88 → 1178.16] I didn't really look that far into it,
[1178.22 → 1179.00] but you can get a subscription
[1179.00 → 1179.56] and they're like,
[1179.62 → 1179.72] yeah,
[1179.72 → 1180.64] it'll show up a little bit
[1180.64 → 1181.64] before the end
[1181.64 → 1183.04] because it's not that big of a deal
[1183.04 → 1183.96] because this stuff lasts
[1183.96 → 1185.10] for like years
[1185.10 → 1186.08] before it expires.
[1186.26 → 1187.44] So it'll show up
[1187.44 → 1188.02] before you're out
[1188.02 → 1188.70] and you're good.
[1189.18 → 1189.38] It's like,
[1189.40 → 1189.58] okay,
[1189.66 → 1189.84] cool.
[1190.12 → 1191.12] And then if you listen
[1191.12 → 1192.24] to everything he just said
[1192.24 → 1192.84] and you imagine
[1192.84 → 1194.00] he's talking about condoms,
[1194.68 → 1196.34] that works too.
[1196.60 → 1197.00] Actually,
[1197.10 → 1198.24] all of that would have been accurate,
[1198.36 → 1198.56] wouldn't it?
[1198.56 → 1198.72] Yep.
[1199.40 → 1200.52] I was paying attention.
[1201.70 → 1202.10] Awesome.
[1202.90 → 1203.42] I mean,
[1203.42 → 1204.88] whenever we're talking about condoms,
[1204.94 → 1206.00] I'm definitely paying attention.
[1207.52 → 1208.16] All right.
[1208.40 → 1209.90] So this is a topic.
[1210.16 → 1211.74] S-S-O-E-L-E.
[1212.12 → 1212.52] Dude,
[1212.72 → 1212.86] we're,
[1212.98 → 1213.46] you know what?
[1213.82 → 1214.70] Normally we don't,
[1214.70 → 1215.18] we don't,
[1215.30 → 1215.62] no.
[1215.92 → 1216.90] Normally we don't change
[1216.90 → 1218.14] people's names on the forum,
[1218.26 → 1219.16] like it's kind of against
[1219.16 → 1219.96] forum policy,
[1220.30 → 1220.84] but if,
[1221.04 → 1222.40] if he or she
[1222.40 → 1224.28] ever wants to message me
[1224.28 → 1225.86] and get a name change,
[1225.98 → 1227.42] we will take care of that for you
[1227.42 → 1228.96] so that I can pronounce your name
[1228.96 → 1230.18] when you post things
[1230.18 → 1231.32] that are helpful like this.
[1231.48 → 1232.20] S-S-S-O-E-L-E.
[1232.20 → 1232.64] Whatever.
[1234.04 → 1234.26] Anyway,
[1234.50 → 1235.20] the point is,
[1235.50 → 1235.96] excuse me,
[1236.16 → 1236.92] the point is that
[1236.92 → 1237.74] Knock2Up
[1237.74 → 1239.42] has released
[1239.42 → 1240.80] Penis Size is Just a Number
[1240.80 → 1243.12] and the entire
[1243.12 → 1243.84] Twitch chat
[1243.84 → 1244.52] exploded.
[1247.72 → 1248.60] Oh my god,
[1248.64 → 1249.28] that's awesome.
[1249.50 → 1250.34] Maybe we should have
[1250.34 → 1251.26] a low-res penis
[1251.26 → 1252.26] on the Resolution
[1252.26 → 1253.34] is Just a Number shirt.
[1254.38 → 1254.78] Well,
[1254.80 → 1255.52] it's like small enough
[1255.52 → 1256.28] that you can't really
[1256.28 → 1257.02] make out what it is.
[1257.08 → 1257.20] Yeah,
[1257.26 → 1257.40] yeah,
[1257.40 → 1258.18] like a low-res
[1258.18 → 1258.86] cock and balls
[1258.86 → 1259.84] like right under the
[1260.08 → 1261.50] in the corner or something.
[1261.62 → 1262.24] So it just looks like
[1262.24 → 1262.88] an underline or something?
[1262.88 → 1263.04] Yeah,
[1263.06 → 1263.68] so it's just like
[1263.68 → 1264.46] four squares,
[1264.64 → 1264.88] right?
[1265.64 → 1266.12] Oh,
[1266.22 → 1266.38] yeah,
[1266.38 → 1266.62] yeah,
[1266.62 → 1266.86] yeah,
[1266.86 → 1266.98] yeah,
[1266.98 → 1267.46] yeah,
[1267.46 → 1267.62] yeah,
[1267.62 → 1268.30] there you go.
[1268.38 → 1268.90] Oh,
[1269.08 → 1269.52] terrible.
[1269.52 → 1269.54] Oh,
[1269.54 → 1270.12] that's awesome.
[1270.62 → 1270.76] You know,
[1270.78 → 1271.72] I don't think I've ever
[1271.72 → 1272.56] used that word
[1272.56 → 1273.32] on the stream before.
[1273.32 → 1273.62] Nope,
[1273.66 → 1274.46] probably not.
[1274.66 → 1275.40] Probably shouldn't.
[1275.74 → 1275.98] Alright,
[1276.16 → 1276.98] so Knock2Up
[1276.98 → 1278.74] has new fans coming,
[1278.88 → 1279.38] you guys.
[1279.52 → 1281.54] This is pretty freaking exciting.
[1281.90 → 1283.58] New fans in new colours.
[1284.00 → 1284.44] Although,
[1284.92 → 1285.80] the way the internet
[1285.80 → 1287.60] exploded about this news
[1287.60 → 1289.62] kind of made me feel like
[1289.62 → 1290.60] they didn't really watch
[1290.60 → 1291.76] our Computer coverage
[1291.76 → 1292.50] from last year.
[1292.80 → 1293.04] Like,
[1293.18 → 1294.42] one year ago,
[1294.60 → 1296.00] we broke this news,
[1296.30 → 1297.90] showed off all these fans.
[1300.66 → 1302.28] And it takes Knock2Up a year.
[1302.32 → 1303.16] This is what I like
[1303.16 → 1303.84] about Knock2Up.
[1304.14 → 1305.30] They don't seem to care
[1305.30 → 1306.12] about making money.
[1306.52 → 1306.76] Nope.
[1307.16 → 1308.10] They just don't.
[1308.52 → 1308.96] They just,
[1309.32 → 1309.56] like,
[1309.84 → 1310.94] so many,
[1311.06 → 1312.68] so many fan companies
[1312.68 → 1313.68] or cooler makers,
[1313.86 → 1314.34] you look at them
[1314.34 → 1315.00] and you just kind of go,
[1315.08 → 1315.42] you know,
[1315.42 → 1317.12] I wish they would just
[1317.12 → 1318.62] give up their precious money
[1318.62 → 1320.46] and spend a bunch of money
[1320.46 → 1321.02] making, like,
[1321.10 → 1322.88] a really great quality fan.
[1322.98 → 1323.42] Which they'd probably
[1323.42 → 1324.34] make a lot of money out of.
[1324.46 → 1324.72] Which,
[1324.96 → 1325.24] well,
[1325.34 → 1325.54] no,
[1325.64 → 1326.32] I don't think so
[1326.32 → 1326.80] because,
[1327.28 → 1327.82] like,
[1327.92 → 1328.82] you look at how much
[1328.82 → 1329.44] Knock2Up spends
[1329.44 → 1330.12] on the packaging,
[1330.46 → 1330.72] you know,
[1330.78 → 1331.34] to make sure that,
[1331.34 → 1332.66] and you can't have
[1332.66 → 1333.42] a premium brand
[1333.42 → 1334.52] without having good packaging.
[1334.70 → 1335.58] I think this has been proven
[1335.58 → 1336.34] time and time again.
[1336.46 → 1337.48] I'm not criticizing them
[1337.48 → 1338.14] for spending money
[1338.14 → 1338.68] on packaging.
[1338.92 → 1339.34] You have to.
[1339.76 → 1340.28] So they've got
[1340.28 → 1341.14] their premium packaging,
[1341.34 → 1342.36] they've got actually
[1342.36 → 1343.96] legitimately well-built products,
[1343.96 → 1345.04] the amount of R&D,
[1345.10 → 1345.24] I mean,
[1345.26 → 1345.94] it took them a year
[1345.94 → 1346.98] to get these to market.
[1347.58 → 1348.52] I don't think that...
[1348.52 → 1349.54] After they were working.
[1349.64 → 1349.88] Yes.
[1350.12 → 1350.32] Yeah.
[1350.42 → 1351.38] I don't think their margin
[1351.38 → 1352.06] is any better
[1352.06 → 1353.12] than any other fan maker,
[1353.18 → 1354.10] and if I had to guess,
[1354.14 → 1354.64] I would guess
[1354.64 → 1355.54] it's probably worse.
[1356.18 → 1356.50] So,
[1357.10 → 1357.34] like,
[1357.38 → 1358.72] on a bomb cost basis,
[1358.86 → 1358.98] like,
[1359.04 → 1359.84] you look at what the other guys
[1359.84 → 1360.58] can afford to spend
[1360.58 → 1361.14] on marketing,
[1361.42 → 1362.58] whereas we go to Knock2Up
[1362.58 → 1362.96] and we're like,
[1363.06 → 1363.28] hey,
[1363.74 → 1364.06] you know,
[1364.16 → 1365.14] we love your products,
[1365.40 → 1366.32] you know,
[1366.36 → 1367.54] we would have no problem
[1367.54 → 1368.68] shilling the heck out of them
[1368.68 → 1369.78] because we think they're great,
[1369.88 → 1370.94] and they just kind of go,
[1370.94 → 1371.38] like,
[1371.76 → 1372.86] we don't really have
[1372.86 → 1373.78] a marketing budget,
[1374.04 → 1374.34] so,
[1375.08 → 1375.42] yeah.
[1376.00 → 1376.94] We thank you for loving
[1376.94 → 1377.48] our products,
[1377.54 → 1378.18] we'll send you as many
[1378.18 → 1379.18] of our products as you want,
[1379.28 → 1379.50] but...
[1379.50 → 1380.54] Which is kind of awesome.
[1380.58 → 1381.12] Which is great.
[1382.18 → 1383.08] Which actually...
[1383.08 → 1384.24] Use them all the time.
[1384.70 → 1386.38] That was all we really wanted anyway.
[1386.54 → 1386.82] Yeah.
[1387.46 → 1387.82] But,
[1387.96 → 1388.18] uh,
[1388.28 → 1390.28] I don't remember
[1390.28 → 1391.34] where I was going with this.
[1391.60 → 1391.84] Right,
[1391.92 → 1392.08] right,
[1392.14 → 1392.32] right.
[1392.36 → 1392.54] So,
[1392.62 → 1393.78] I love that they just have
[1393.78 → 1394.34] the balls
[1394.34 → 1395.08] to have a product
[1395.08 → 1396.02] that's pretty much ready
[1396.02 → 1396.52] to rock,
[1396.60 → 1397.38] like a year ago,
[1397.38 → 1398.80] take a year to bring it out
[1398.80 → 1399.70] because that's how long
[1399.70 → 1400.88] it takes to get it perfect.
[1400.98 → 1401.88] And I'm assuming it's perfect.
[1402.24 → 1402.96] They are in the mail,
[1403.04 → 1403.96] but we don't have them yet.
[1404.12 → 1404.26] Yeah.
[1404.32 → 1404.64] But anyway,
[1404.74 → 1405.68] the Redux line
[1405.68 → 1407.32] takes away some of the
[1407.32 → 1408.12] little extras,
[1408.34 → 1409.44] like rubber grommets,
[1409.82 → 1410.72] and brings back
[1410.72 → 1411.96] some of the older designs
[1411.96 → 1413.18] that we haven't seen in a while,
[1413.30 → 1414.52] like the older S12,
[1414.82 → 1415.66] non-Redux,
[1416.04 → 1417.40] and costs them down a little bit
[1417.40 → 1418.66] to make Noctua quality
[1418.66 → 1420.32] a little bit more affordable,
[1420.54 → 1421.42] which I think is great,
[1421.62 → 1421.80] but...
[1421.80 → 1422.10] And then,
[1422.16 → 1422.48] nope.
[1422.68 → 1423.00] Oh,
[1423.08 → 1423.78] these are the ones
[1423.78 → 1424.78] that have my attention.
[1424.90 → 1425.06] I mean,
[1425.06 → 1426.92] we're talking $30 plus
[1426.92 → 1427.70] a fan
[1427.70 → 1429.86] for industrial-grade
[1429.86 → 1430.96] Noctua fans,
[1431.04 → 1431.94] and they're black,
[1432.26 → 1432.88] and they just have
[1432.88 → 1433.98] little brown accents,
[1434.34 → 1434.72] which is cool.
[1434.72 → 1435.56] And they have
[1435.56 → 1436.32] all the way up to
[1436.32 → 1439.48] IP67 water and dustproof ness.
[1439.64 → 1440.30] They're available
[1440.30 → 1441.28] at a couple of different
[1441.28 → 1442.16] RPM levels,
[1442.44 → 1443.74] and holy balls,
[1443.90 → 1444.78] these are exciting
[1444.78 → 1445.58] because,
[1446.20 → 1446.96] well,
[1447.34 → 1447.86] that...
[1447.86 → 1449.38] It's the only fan...
[1449.38 → 1450.54] They look really sharp.
[1450.66 → 1452.02] ...that really matters
[1452.02 → 1453.18] if you want the...
[1453.18 → 1453.78] And again,
[1453.78 → 1454.86] I haven't even touched them yet,
[1455.02 → 1456.52] but because of Noctua's reputation,
[1456.92 → 1457.96] I'm comfortable saying
[1457.96 → 1458.42] they're going to be
[1458.42 → 1459.16] the only fan
[1459.16 → 1460.14] in terms of the highest
[1460.14 → 1461.30] possible quality
[1461.30 → 1462.62] PC fan experience
[1462.62 → 1463.20] that you're going to be
[1463.20 → 1463.88] wanting to look at,
[1463.94 → 1464.64] so...
[1464.64 → 1466.44] And those rubber accents
[1466.44 → 1466.94] on the end
[1466.94 → 1467.20] can,
[1467.38 → 1467.60] one,
[1467.70 → 1468.50] probably be changed
[1468.50 → 1469.82] in colour pretty easily.
[1470.02 → 1470.22] Yep.
[1470.78 → 1471.48] And two,
[1471.58 → 1472.14] they're removable,
[1472.40 → 1473.58] so that'll be even more
[1473.58 → 1474.44] easy to change the colour.
[1474.90 → 1475.16] Yep.
[1475.16 → 1476.38] And they're the dark,
[1476.54 → 1477.12] dark brown.
[1477.30 → 1477.56] Yes.
[1477.62 → 1478.32] Not the light brown
[1478.32 → 1478.84] that a lot of people
[1478.84 → 1479.78] complained about anyway.
[1479.86 → 1480.02] Yeah.
[1480.10 → 1481.48] I'm all right with the colour.
[1481.60 → 1481.64] Me too.
[1481.64 → 1482.02] I don't mind it.
[1482.02 → 1483.08] It's like a chocolate colour
[1483.08 → 1483.86] as opposed to like...
[1483.86 → 1484.06] Yeah.
[1484.38 → 1486.08] ...like a digestive problem colour.
[1486.08 → 1487.50] And if Asus stops making
[1487.50 → 1488.38] golden motherboards,
[1489.00 → 1491.10] maybe it'll be okay.
[1491.78 → 1492.88] Asus's motherboards,
[1492.98 → 1493.76] I'll have you know,
[1493.86 → 1494.80] are the gold standard.
[1495.26 → 1495.52] Oh.
[1495.84 → 1496.90] And that is why they're gold.
[1497.98 → 1499.06] Speaking of Asus,
[1499.18 → 1500.66] is JJ ever going to join us here?
[1501.08 → 1501.34] I don't know.
[1501.48 → 1503.68] We haven't had our video chat open,
[1503.80 → 1504.78] so I don't even know
[1504.78 → 1507.84] if he has tried to send
[1507.84 → 1509.24] a friend request or anything.
[1509.24 → 1511.24] I don't see any requests
[1511.24 → 1512.80] and I don't see any emails
[1512.80 → 1514.92] from the Jester,
[1515.46 → 1518.06] so maybe JJ will join us next week.
[1518.18 → 1518.98] I don't know.
[1519.08 → 1519.44] Boom.
[1519.70 → 1520.34] Oh, you know,
[1520.40 → 1521.30] we never showed the results
[1521.30 → 1522.10] of that straw poll
[1522.10 → 1523.54] that we ended up crashing the stream
[1523.54 → 1524.56] over wanting to show them.
[1524.88 → 1526.82] Are you happy with your ISP?
[1527.72 → 1528.16] Wow.
[1529.26 → 1531.20] A third of the people say yes.
[1531.26 → 1531.90] Remember though,
[1531.98 → 1534.02] our time zone for this show
[1534.02 → 1535.42] is very well lined up.
[1536.02 → 1536.76] With Australia.
[1537.32 → 1537.86] Oh, yeah.
[1538.44 → 1539.06] That's a good point.
[1539.56 → 1540.30] They should definitely
[1540.30 → 1540.94] be answering no.
[1541.08 → 1542.66] All of them should be answering no.
[1542.90 → 1544.14] Anyone from Australia,
[1544.48 → 1546.18] go back and change your answer.
[1546.32 → 1546.70] Seriously.
[1546.98 → 1548.10] Because you're wrong.
[1550.18 → 1551.04] Not good enough.
[1551.06 → 1553.44] A full 24% said cucumber.
[1555.02 → 1555.72] You know what?
[1555.76 → 1556.66] I might have said cucumber.
[1557.08 → 1557.78] Because you don't put
[1557.78 → 1558.92] multi-options, do you?
[1559.14 → 1559.48] Nope.
[1559.62 → 1559.90] Nope.
[1560.54 → 1562.30] You have to choose one option.
[1562.30 → 1563.10] You've got to commit.
[1563.46 → 1565.24] Yes, no, or cucumber.
[1566.96 → 1567.78] Oh, man.
[1567.78 → 1570.56] We haven't even covered anything.
[1571.34 → 1573.00] We didn't really have much of a show
[1573.00 → 1573.66] lined up today
[1573.66 → 1574.92] because we were expecting JJ
[1574.92 → 1575.76] to talk to us.
[1577.26 → 1578.66] And tell us about Z97.
[1578.94 → 1579.56] We talked about stuff.
[1579.64 → 1580.44] We talked about FCC.
[1580.66 → 1581.56] We talked about Watch Dogs.
[1581.68 → 1583.34] We talked about Noctua fans.
[1583.48 → 1584.48] We talked about Noctua fans.
[1584.56 → 1584.82] Okay.
[1585.06 → 1586.20] Well, let's talk about how
[1586.20 → 1587.10] Xbox One
[1587.10 → 1589.34] is slightly less unfair now.
[1589.34 → 1591.92] So, they did a couple of things here
[1591.92 → 1594.54] that I think I would look at
[1594.54 → 1595.06] and say,
[1595.24 → 1596.48] wow, that's really commendable
[1596.48 → 1598.28] if they weren't so terrible
[1598.28 → 1599.22] in the first place.
[1599.66 → 1600.58] So, number one
[1600.58 → 1601.64] is the fact that,
[1601.76 → 1602.52] and honestly,
[1602.70 → 1604.66] I've never owned an Xbox.
[1604.84 → 1605.26] Okay, no,
[1605.32 → 1606.32] I've owned an Xbox.
[1606.74 → 1609.62] I have an Xbox 360
[1609.62 → 1610.86] and an Xbox One.
[1611.04 → 1611.68] Okay, I do.
[1611.86 → 1612.62] I own two Boxes.
[1612.62 → 1614.12] But they were both for,
[1614.34 → 1616.14] not for really personal use much.
[1616.18 → 1617.18] I could have used them.
[1617.34 → 1618.02] But you didn't.
[1618.02 → 1618.34] Right.
[1621.70 → 1623.48] So, one of the biggest issues
[1623.48 → 1625.26] that I had from day one,
[1625.34 → 1626.62] like when I found out
[1626.62 → 1628.36] as a PC gamer traditionally,
[1628.76 → 1629.02] anyway,
[1629.10 → 1630.08] this was posted on the forum
[1630.08 → 1630.76] by Raft,
[1631.12 → 1632.08] when I found out
[1632.08 → 1632.86] as a PC gamer
[1632.86 → 1633.74] that they had
[1633.74 → 1635.74] an Xbox Live Gold membership
[1635.74 → 1637.54] that I had to have
[1637.54 → 1638.26] to, like,
[1638.62 → 1639.64] update my profile
[1639.64 → 1641.28] or voice chat with people
[1641.28 → 1642.34] or play multiplayer,
[1642.90 → 1643.68] I was just like,
[1643.78 → 1645.02] what, are you high?
[1645.64 → 1646.74] Like, are you stupid?
[1646.74 → 1646.86] David?
[1647.42 → 1648.20] Like, if we just,
[1648.38 → 1649.54] and I kind of said at the time,
[1649.60 → 1650.82] I remember saying at the time,
[1650.92 → 1652.74] look, if we all just boycott this,
[1653.06 → 1654.08] it'll go away.
[1654.32 → 1655.14] Like that.
[1655.86 → 1656.26] Instantly.
[1656.42 → 1657.18] It'll go away.
[1657.52 → 1659.14] Because they have to sell consoles
[1659.14 → 1660.64] and they have to sell games.
[1660.86 → 1662.00] And if we refuse,
[1662.34 → 1663.82] if we just all stand there
[1663.82 → 1665.14] and not pay for it,
[1665.48 → 1666.50] those subscription fees
[1666.50 → 1667.22] will go away.
[1667.76 → 1668.88] Looks like it's happening.
[1669.34 → 1670.62] Microsoft is getting
[1670.62 → 1671.34] a little desperate.
[1671.34 → 1672.62] And then the other thing
[1672.62 → 1673.12] that's terrible
[1673.12 → 1673.82] in the first place
[1673.82 → 1675.04] is the fact that the Kine ct,
[1675.30 → 1676.94] which was forced
[1676.94 → 1678.80] to be bundled
[1678.80 → 1679.70] with the Xbox One,
[1679.74 → 1680.84] you were forced to buy one
[1680.84 → 1681.96] if you wanted an Xbox One,
[1682.34 → 1684.14] is now an option.
[1685.56 → 1685.88] And I mean,
[1685.98 → 1686.82] Kine ct is just,
[1687.38 → 1687.64] like,
[1688.08 → 1689.02] it's one of those things
[1689.02 → 1689.52] where,
[1690.10 → 1690.82] you know what,
[1691.52 → 1692.56] $100 Delta
[1692.56 → 1694.28] and I wanted an Xbox One,
[1694.34 → 1695.20] I would probably
[1695.20 → 1696.20] buy the Kine ct option.
[1697.10 → 1698.58] I have a young family.
[1699.16 → 1699.62] For kids,
[1700.26 → 1700.82] you know what,
[1701.14 → 1702.74] casual Kine ct games,
[1702.92 → 1703.68] I would rather,
[1703.84 → 1704.82] and this is like,
[1704.92 → 1706.42] this is like that kind of thing
[1706.42 → 1707.92] that the gaming community
[1707.92 → 1708.74] makes fun of.
[1708.96 → 1710.28] And I wholeheartedly agree
[1710.28 → 1710.86] with you guys.
[1710.94 → 1711.76] It's all kind of silly.
[1711.88 → 1712.88] And you'd have the control
[1712.88 → 1713.62] of being able to stand
[1713.62 → 1714.16] in your kitchen
[1714.16 → 1715.04] and when your kid
[1715.04 → 1715.84] won't get off the Xbox,
[1716.14 → 1716.56] just be like,
[1716.60 → 1717.22] Xbox off!
[1718.04 → 1718.28] Like,
[1718.34 → 1719.04] it's one of those things
[1719.04 → 1720.42] where I would rather
[1720.42 → 1721.68] my kids play at a game
[1721.68 → 1722.70] that at least has them
[1722.70 → 1723.66] waving their arm around.
[1724.66 → 1725.54] If nothing else.
[1725.54 → 1726.16] I don't,
[1726.20 → 1727.52] I don't want to see,
[1727.72 → 1729.36] I don't want to see my son
[1729.36 → 1730.20] like,
[1730.32 → 1731.44] slack-jawed life death
[1731.44 → 1732.98] for four hours at a time.
[1733.86 → 1734.72] It's one of those things.
[1734.82 → 1734.94] Like,
[1735.00 → 1735.56] I don't know,
[1735.64 → 1735.86] like,
[1736.14 → 1737.40] I did it as a kid.
[1737.66 → 1738.46] I turned out alright.
[1738.90 → 1740.04] But at the same time,
[1740.08 → 1740.34] I just,
[1740.52 → 1740.90] I don't know,
[1740.94 → 1742.54] it just seems like...
[1743.56 → 1744.10] It can happen.
[1744.20 → 1744.94] You just probably want
[1744.94 → 1745.66] a mix of things.
[1745.82 → 1746.10] Like,
[1746.10 → 1747.08] my parents were cool with it,
[1747.14 → 1748.30] but I was extremely active.
[1748.42 → 1749.36] I was in tons of sports
[1749.36 → 1749.88] and all this kind of stuff.
[1749.88 → 1750.08] Right.
[1750.34 → 1751.34] But then I would also
[1751.34 → 1753.64] lay completely across the couch
[1753.64 → 1754.36] and play Morten
[1754.36 → 1755.06] for days on end.
[1755.28 → 1755.50] Right.
[1755.62 → 1756.06] So like,
[1756.18 → 1756.72] I don't know.
[1757.58 → 1757.98] Like,
[1757.98 → 1759.20] I don't know what the right answer is,
[1759.28 → 1759.52] but I,
[1759.58 → 1760.38] but I will say that
[1760.38 → 1761.20] if I was going to buy
[1761.20 → 1762.58] the kids an Xbox game,
[1762.70 → 1764.26] I would rather like,
[1764.32 → 1764.62] you know,
[1764.74 → 1765.92] dance-off challenge
[1765.92 → 1766.44] or whatever
[1766.44 → 1767.64] versus like,
[1767.94 → 1768.20] you know,
[1768.32 → 1768.62] blood,
[1768.76 → 1769.50] blood sport,
[1769.76 → 1771.52] 16 kind of,
[1771.88 → 1772.10] you know,
[1772.10 → 1772.76] Call of Duty 7,
[1772.76 → 1772.82] Call of Duty 7,
[1772.82 → 1773.28] yeah,
[1773.52 → 1774.14] Call of Duty,
[1774.14 → 1774.66] like,
[1774.78 → 1775.52] Space Edition
[1775.52 → 1776.94] or whatever that...
[1776.94 → 1777.30] Don't worry,
[1777.38 → 1778.46] the amoebas have AI.
[1778.98 → 1779.32] Yeah.
[1780.10 → 1781.08] We got like,
[1781.12 → 1782.12] a big time actor
[1782.12 → 1783.02] to put in the trailer
[1783.02 → 1783.94] because we don't know
[1783.94 → 1784.68] what else to do.
[1784.82 → 1785.88] Who just plays a character
[1785.88 → 1786.40] that he has,
[1786.46 → 1787.18] no matter what,
[1787.28 → 1789.04] definitely very recently played.
[1789.54 → 1789.80] Like,
[1789.84 → 1790.86] no differences.
[1791.96 → 1792.44] I know.
[1792.44 → 1794.00] It's exactly the same person.
[1794.26 → 1795.66] Have you watched that at all?
[1795.76 → 1796.00] Yes,
[1796.04 → 1796.44] I have.
[1796.56 → 1796.74] Yeah.
[1796.90 → 1797.54] I'm just like,
[1797.68 → 1798.08] wow.
[1800.22 → 1801.84] Why is this even a video game?
[1801.94 → 1802.66] Why don't we just make it
[1802.66 → 1803.64] a movie then at this point?
[1803.68 → 1804.78] I legitimately looked up
[1804.78 → 1805.86] to see if he was actually
[1805.86 → 1806.82] playing the same character.
[1807.28 → 1807.58] Like,
[1807.60 → 1808.12] I was wondering
[1808.12 → 1809.08] if they had made a deal
[1809.08 → 1810.00] with Netflix or something
[1810.00 → 1810.36] to like,
[1810.44 → 1811.28] integrate the show
[1811.28 → 1811.90] into the game.
[1811.98 → 1812.24] I was like,
[1812.26 → 1812.36] oh,
[1812.40 → 1813.26] that's kind of interesting.
[1813.26 → 1814.26] That's an interesting idea.
[1814.38 → 1814.62] Nope.
[1815.34 → 1815.90] It's like,
[1815.96 → 1816.16] oh,
[1816.66 → 1817.08] okay.
[1817.94 → 1818.72] Guess not.
[1819.10 → 1819.88] So anyway,
[1820.20 → 1821.42] I don't remember
[1821.42 → 1822.60] where we were going
[1822.60 → 1823.14] with this,
[1823.28 → 1823.50] but,
[1823.62 → 1825.06] so,
[1825.06 → 1825.88] you will be able
[1825.88 → 1826.52] to buy the Kine ct
[1826.52 → 1827.66] separately later this fall.
[1827.76 → 1828.46] You can get the console
[1828.46 → 1829.62] for $100 cheaper
[1829.62 → 1830.78] without Kine ct.
[1831.12 → 1832.06] Someone's calling me
[1832.06 → 1832.66] and,
[1832.82 → 1833.20] uh,
[1833.26 → 1833.88] something else.
[1833.98 → 1834.10] Right.
[1834.18 → 1834.86] Xbox Gold
[1834.86 → 1836.22] is no longer required
[1836.22 → 1837.38] for popular entertainment
[1837.38 → 1838.48] experiences like Netflix
[1838.48 → 1840.04] and Hulu Plus.
[1840.28 → 1840.48] You know,
[1840.60 → 1841.56] that's baffling to me.
[1841.60 → 1842.38] Why did you ever need
[1842.38 → 1843.28] that in the first place?
[1843.44 → 1843.56] Yeah,
[1843.58 → 1844.32] and I can't imagine
[1844.32 → 1844.80] that Netflix,
[1844.98 → 1845.60] Hulu Plus
[1845.60 → 1846.02] and those guys
[1846.02 → 1846.94] really wanted that
[1846.94 → 1847.80] to be there at all.
[1847.92 → 1848.40] They've probably been
[1848.40 → 1849.44] pushing against it as well.
[1849.92 → 1850.86] But what can they do,
[1850.90 → 1851.06] right?
[1851.28 → 1851.52] Yeah.
[1851.72 → 1851.96] You know,
[1852.00 → 1852.70] I used to play
[1852.70 → 1853.88] Halo 2 online,
[1854.02 → 1854.62] so I had to have
[1854.62 → 1855.26] a gold subscription
[1855.26 → 1856.26] and what I would do
[1856.26 → 1856.74] is I would have
[1856.74 → 1857.64] my whole friends list
[1857.64 → 1858.22] written out
[1858.22 → 1860.86] and then every single time
[1860.86 → 1861.50] that,
[1861.56 → 1862.34] uh,
[1862.96 → 1863.54] You know you were
[1863.54 → 1864.12] a sucker, right?
[1864.12 → 1864.46] My one month
[1864.46 → 1865.28] would end up,
[1865.44 → 1866.48] every time my one month
[1866.48 → 1866.66] would,
[1866.72 → 1867.04] uh,
[1867.04 → 1867.48] close,
[1867.66 → 1868.26] you would get a
[1868.26 → 1868.98] one month free
[1868.98 → 1869.38] if you made
[1869.38 → 1870.28] a new MSN account.
[1872.62 → 1872.94] Oh.
[1872.94 → 1874.26] So I had my whole
[1874.26 → 1875.30] friends list written out.
[1877.70 → 1878.64] I'm not going to go
[1878.64 → 1879.34] into what I did
[1879.34 → 1879.92] from there.
[1879.98 → 1880.80] Your friends must have
[1880.80 → 1882.30] But I had a hard copy
[1882.30 → 1883.44] of my friends list.
[1884.02 → 1884.22] Yeah,
[1884.30 → 1884.64] they did.
[1885.36 → 1886.74] That is so annoying.
[1887.86 → 1888.26] Oh,
[1888.42 → 1889.28] it's the first,
[1889.46 → 1889.86] okay,
[1890.14 → 1890.66] Luke's
[1890.66 → 1891.82] friggin' late.
[1892.78 → 1894.14] Going to have to re-at him
[1894.14 → 1894.78] because he's a
[1894.78 → 1896.38] jack-at bum
[1896.38 → 1897.50] poo head.
[1898.08 → 1898.78] I was like,
[1898.92 → 1899.96] I was paying for
[1899.96 → 1900.70] my games at that
[1900.70 → 1901.22] point in time
[1901.22 → 1901.58] and like,
[1901.64 → 1902.28] there's no way
[1902.28 → 1902.94] I'm going to pay
[1902.94 → 1903.88] that much money
[1903.88 → 1904.80] for this stupid
[1904.80 → 1905.62] online subscription
[1905.62 → 1907.12] that I don't want to do.
[1907.26 → 1907.82] And like,
[1907.94 → 1908.48] there's no way
[1908.48 → 1909.10] your parents are gonna
[1909.10 → 1909.78] buy that for you.
[1909.88 → 1910.08] No.
[1910.26 → 1910.52] Nope.
[1911.34 → 1911.58] I,
[1911.58 → 1911.84] I,
[1911.84 → 1912.08] I,
[1912.08 → 1912.54] I've,
[1912.54 → 1913.40] I've met him,
[1913.44 → 1914.06] I've spent enough
[1914.06 → 1914.84] time with his parents
[1914.84 → 1915.30] to be like,
[1915.36 → 1915.50] yeah,
[1915.58 → 1916.38] they're pretty supportive
[1916.38 → 1916.98] but like,
[1917.04 → 1917.82] you figure it out.
[1918.08 → 1918.28] Yeah,
[1918.36 → 1918.90] I paid for,
[1918.90 → 1919.86] I played Ever Quest
[1919.86 → 1920.42] back in the day.
[1920.62 → 1921.36] I paid for those.
[1921.90 → 1922.46] I paid for those
[1922.46 → 1922.84] monthlies.
[1922.84 → 1923.92] So that's why
[1923.92 → 1924.62] you got into
[1924.62 → 1925.36] EVE Online.
[1926.04 → 1926.76] Because you could
[1926.76 → 1927.74] earn your subscription
[1927.74 → 1928.08] fee.
[1930.16 → 1931.06] Wow subscriptions,
[1931.26 → 1931.82] I think my parents
[1931.82 → 1932.26] helped me out
[1932.26 → 1933.08] a little bit though
[1933.08 → 1933.80] but then it was
[1933.80 → 1934.18] my brother,
[1934.28 → 1934.80] my dad and I
[1934.80 → 1935.04] and we all
[1935.04 → 1935.56] played together.
[1935.80 → 1935.94] Right,
[1936.08 → 1936.64] well that's different.
[1936.66 → 1936.84] And like my mom came
[1936.84 → 1937.42] and played with us
[1937.42 → 1938.44] sometimes too and stuff
[1938.44 → 1939.10] so it was like,
[1939.16 → 1939.42] we're all,
[1939.60 → 1939.78] yeah,
[1940.24 → 1941.10] that was kind of cool.
[1941.44 → 1942.16] And for a lot of times
[1942.16 → 1943.18] we even shared an account
[1943.18 → 1944.32] with all three of us.
[1944.62 → 1944.64] So,
[1945.46 → 1945.66] yeah.
[1946.20 → 1946.56] Alright,
[1946.80 → 1947.14] so,
[1947.28 → 1947.98] you know what's funny
[1947.98 → 1948.98] is there was a post
[1948.98 → 1949.84] in this thread.
[1949.94 → 1950.62] So this was originally
[1950.62 → 1951.80] posted by Tech Fanatic
[1951.80 → 1952.34] on the forum,
[1952.34 → 1953.04] thank you very much
[1953.04 → 1953.48] for posting,
[1953.88 → 1954.86] that said that
[1954.86 → 1955.32] like,
[1955.58 → 1956.20] ha ha ha,
[1956.34 → 1957.44] Linus was so down
[1957.44 → 1959.38] on AMD's Free Sync,
[1959.70 → 1960.06] lol,
[1960.36 → 1961.12] you know,
[1961.22 → 1962.16] goes to show him.
[1962.30 → 1963.00] And I was a little bit
[1963.00 → 1963.70] confused by that.
[1963.76 → 1965.02] Was I ever at any point
[1965.02 → 1966.12] down on Free Sync?
[1966.12 → 1967.44] A little bit.
[1968.20 → 1968.74] What did I say?
[1968.80 → 1969.28] You said it wasn't
[1969.28 → 1969.86] going to work.
[1970.56 → 1971.10] But then I think you,
[1971.16 → 1971.38] I think you,
[1971.38 → 1972.16] I said it wouldn't work
[1972.16 → 1973.10] with the scalers now.
[1973.32 → 1973.56] Yeah,
[1973.78 → 1974.84] and I'm pretty sure
[1974.84 → 1975.86] specific words
[1975.86 → 1976.74] were current form.
[1976.94 → 1977.96] And I said that
[1977.96 → 1978.88] that was NVIDIA
[1978.88 → 1979.60] saying that.
[1980.16 → 1980.44] Yeah.
[1981.26 → 1982.08] And actually,
[1982.08 → 1983.22] I know that you said
[1983.22 → 1983.68] it won't work
[1983.68 → 1984.40] in its current form.
[1984.62 → 1985.48] And when the news
[1985.48 → 1986.52] first broke
[1986.52 → 1988.28] on Nanotech,
[1988.40 → 1989.54] I actually posted
[1989.54 → 1990.32] that to Facebook
[1990.32 → 1991.32] and I was like,
[1991.64 → 1992.14] holy crap,
[1992.22 → 1993.04] does this completely
[1993.04 → 1994.84] invalidate G-Sync's existence?
[1995.72 → 1996.04] Yeah.
[1996.30 → 1996.66] So,
[1996.84 → 1997.20] I don't know
[1997.20 → 1998.20] where all this came from,
[1998.32 → 1999.30] but I am totally
[1999.30 → 2001.04] 100% on board
[2001.04 → 2002.80] with AMD's Free Sync,
[2002.92 → 2004.44] now called Active Sync.
[2004.92 → 2005.70] There's one thing
[2005.70 → 2006.70] that I'm a little bit
[2006.70 → 2008.00] sketched out about so far,
[2008.12 → 2008.64] and that was
[2008.64 → 2009.52] doing some reading.
[2009.82 → 2011.96] It's not 100% clear to me
[2011.96 → 2012.86] what cards it's going
[2012.86 → 2013.38] to work on,
[2013.70 → 2015.52] because it looks like
[2015.52 → 2016.56] they're saying
[2016.56 → 2019.22] R9 290X
[2019.22 → 2021.28] and 260X,
[2021.52 → 2022.62] which would basically
[2022.62 → 2025.42] be Hawaii version,
[2025.90 → 2026.66] whatever it is,
[2026.72 → 2027.32] the new ones.
[2027.92 → 2028.44] So,
[2028.58 → 2029.72] not the rebadges
[2029.72 → 2031.20] of the Tahiti Core ones.
[2031.72 → 2033.14] Which would really suck.
[2033.20 → 2033.58] Which would be
[2033.58 → 2034.20] really sucky.
[2034.28 → 2034.74] And then there's
[2034.74 → 2035.38] no mention
[2035.38 → 2036.68] of NVIDIA cards.
[2036.84 → 2036.98] Now,
[2037.48 → 2038.70] what I think is,
[2039.56 → 2041.68] AMD's whole stance
[2041.68 → 2042.86] lately has been
[2042.86 → 2043.66] open standards
[2043.66 → 2044.34] this and that,
[2044.60 → 2046.22] so I sincerely hope
[2046.22 → 2047.64] that it's an open standard,
[2048.24 → 2049.08] but,
[2049.22 → 2050.86] I would hate
[2050.86 → 2052.38] to see it happen,
[2052.76 → 2053.92] where NVIDIA's pushing
[2053.92 → 2054.98] a G-Sync standard,
[2055.42 → 2056.64] and AMD's pushing
[2056.64 → 2058.04] an Adaptive Sync standard,
[2058.20 → 2058.78] and we end up
[2058.78 → 2059.24] with monitors
[2059.24 → 2059.96] that support
[2059.96 → 2061.06] one or the other
[2061.06 → 2061.82] or both.
[2062.18 → 2062.44] Because,
[2062.88 → 2063.58] and this is something
[2063.58 → 2065.00] I have criticized NVIDIA
[2065.00 → 2065.40] about,
[2065.72 → 2066.46] asking people
[2066.46 → 2067.88] to lock into something
[2067.88 → 2069.34] is kind of sucky.
[2069.58 → 2070.54] I do understand
[2070.54 → 2071.62] that if you develop
[2071.62 → 2072.34] the technology,
[2072.52 → 2072.66] like,
[2072.72 → 2073.88] they basically built
[2073.88 → 2074.72] their own
[2074.72 → 2075.72] scalar hardware
[2075.72 → 2076.36] for monitors.
[2076.36 → 2077.42] It's not just
[2077.42 → 2078.44] a software trick.
[2078.92 → 2079.18] I mean,
[2079.22 → 2079.88] if you're developing
[2079.88 → 2080.52] the technology,
[2080.66 → 2081.16] I understand
[2081.16 → 2081.78] that you want
[2081.78 → 2082.60] to benefit from it,
[2082.68 → 2083.18] and the only way
[2083.18 → 2083.72] you're going to benefit
[2083.72 → 2084.90] from it is a license
[2084.90 → 2085.90] feed to the monitor guys
[2085.90 → 2086.82] and selling more
[2086.82 → 2087.46] graphics cards
[2087.46 → 2088.42] to go with those monitors,
[2088.70 → 2089.64] but that doesn't mean
[2089.64 → 2090.44] I have to be happy
[2090.44 → 2091.00] about it.
[2091.00 → 2093.38] And I think that
[2093.38 → 2094.38] it will be definitely
[2094.38 → 2095.40] the wrong path
[2095.40 → 2096.22] if both of them
[2096.22 → 2097.02] try to do that.
[2097.14 → 2097.34] I mean,
[2097.40 → 2097.86] the good news
[2097.86 → 2098.82] about Adaptive Sync
[2098.82 → 2100.24] is unlike G-Sync,
[2100.46 → 2101.16] it looks like
[2101.16 → 2101.58] it's going to be
[2101.58 → 2102.68] a very simple implementation,
[2103.08 → 2103.94] so anything with
[2103.94 → 2106.10] DisplayPort 1.2a
[2106.10 → 2108.84] will have Adaptive Sync
[2108.84 → 2110.22] as part of the VESA standard,
[2111.06 → 2113.34] which pretty much,
[2113.48 → 2114.00] I mean,
[2114.32 → 2114.72] you know,
[2114.90 → 2116.42] don't quote me on this
[2116.42 → 2117.68] six months down the line.
[2117.68 → 2120.58] Really don't quote me on this,
[2120.70 → 2122.40] but if that happens,
[2122.88 → 2123.42] Active Sync
[2123.42 → 2124.18] is going to just be
[2124.18 → 2125.14] in any monitor
[2125.14 → 2126.42] with a DisplayPort port,
[2126.54 → 2127.34] because remember guys,
[2127.44 → 2128.36] DisplayPort is free
[2128.36 → 2129.46] to implement on your monitor
[2129.46 → 2130.72] compared to the license fees
[2130.72 → 2131.82] associated with HDMI,
[2132.28 → 2134.22] so it'll just support Active Sync,
[2134.26 → 2135.42] and I really don't know
[2135.42 → 2136.02] what the future
[2136.02 → 2136.94] of G-Sync will be.
[2137.22 → 2138.38] One thing that NVIDIA
[2138.38 → 2139.82] did say openly
[2139.82 → 2141.92] was that we really want
[2141.92 → 2142.96] the gaming experience
[2142.96 → 2143.76] to be better,
[2144.38 → 2145.44] and that's why
[2145.44 → 2146.56] we made this technology,
[2146.76 → 2147.60] so I really hope
[2147.60 → 2149.22] that if they managed
[2149.22 → 2150.64] to move the industry forward,
[2150.92 → 2152.06] that they still feel good
[2152.06 → 2152.60] about themselves,
[2152.86 → 2154.18] and that we all still remember
[2154.18 → 2154.96] who did it.
[2155.54 → 2156.10] So that's,
[2156.18 → 2156.46] I guess,
[2156.48 → 2157.54] all I have to say about that.
[2157.74 → 2159.08] And I say the same,
[2159.18 → 2160.10] and it's not because,
[2160.18 → 2160.44] you know,
[2160.68 → 2161.50] I've got,
[2161.64 → 2161.94] you know,
[2162.02 → 2162.66] a raging,
[2163.10 → 2163.70] you know,
[2164.08 → 2165.38] hard-on for NVIDIA.
[2165.38 → 2167.14] It's because I do appreciate
[2167.14 → 2167.88] anyone who pushes
[2167.88 → 2168.72] the industry forward.
[2168.86 → 2169.38] I don't have
[2169.38 → 2171.10] a ton of love for Apple,
[2171.30 → 2172.24] but I appreciate
[2172.24 → 2173.04] that they pushed
[2173.04 → 2174.16] resolution forward,
[2174.32 → 2175.24] even though they don't
[2175.24 → 2176.16] even make displays.
[2176.16 → 2177.78] why did it take Apple
[2177.78 → 2180.30] to develop the retina concept?
[2182.48 → 2182.92] Why?
[2183.20 → 2183.66] And like,
[2183.68 → 2184.60] I appreciate other things
[2184.60 → 2184.94] they do,
[2185.02 → 2185.74] like the fact that
[2185.74 → 2186.98] they focus on accurate
[2186.98 → 2188.16] colour for their displays,
[2188.56 → 2189.48] whereas everyone else,
[2189.64 → 2190.38] other than Google,
[2190.72 → 2191.28] seems to be,
[2191.42 → 2192.48] and HTC is doing
[2192.48 → 2193.10] a better job lately.
[2193.10 → 2193.36] I mean,
[2193.42 → 2193.52] well,
[2193.56 → 2194.10] everyone's doing
[2194.10 → 2194.78] a better job lately,
[2194.92 → 2196.34] but Apple started it.
[2196.34 → 2198.24] And so I think
[2198.24 → 2198.86] we just all need
[2198.86 → 2199.46] to appreciate
[2199.46 → 2200.62] the guys who innovate,
[2200.74 → 2201.58] even if that innovation
[2201.58 → 2202.92] isn't inventing
[2202.92 → 2204.40] or actually building something,
[2204.52 → 2206.12] if it's just awareness
[2206.12 → 2207.30] and making people understand
[2207.30 → 2208.28] that something needs to happen.
[2209.08 → 2209.58] So there,
[2209.80 → 2210.32] that's what I have
[2210.32 → 2210.98] to say about that.
[2211.04 → 2211.48] I guess there's
[2211.48 → 2212.32] some other stuff in there,
[2212.36 → 2212.74] isn't there?
[2212.82 → 2213.32] Something about,
[2213.38 → 2213.72] like,
[2214.48 → 2216.54] potentially DisplayPort 1.3
[2216.54 → 2216.84] as well?
[2217.36 → 2217.70] Well,
[2217.80 → 2218.56] DisplayPort 1.3
[2218.56 → 2219.22] will be able
[2219.22 → 2220.12] to support 8K,
[2220.12 → 2222.52] although it'll have
[2222.52 → 2223.96] to change the connector
[2223.96 → 2224.56] to be able to support
[2224.56 → 2226.54] 8K or 4K 3D.
[2226.90 → 2228.14] So that's not necessarily
[2228.14 → 2229.70] tied into the actual
[2229.70 → 2230.58] Adaptive Sync thing,
[2230.66 → 2231.10] that's just talking
[2231.10 → 2232.30] about future DisplayPort connectors.
[2232.36 → 2233.02] And if anyone wants
[2233.02 → 2234.22] an explanation of Adaptive Sync,
[2234.28 → 2235.10] basically what it means
[2235.10 → 2235.88] is that your monitor
[2235.88 → 2236.82] will only refresh
[2236.82 → 2237.94] when your graphics card
[2237.94 → 2238.68] outputs a signal.
[2238.88 → 2240.30] So it's just like G-Sync
[2240.30 → 2241.12] and it will reduce
[2241.12 → 2242.42] tearing and lag,
[2242.60 → 2243.72] and it really does
[2243.72 → 2244.92] make a very big difference.
[2245.08 → 2245.52] It's, like,
[2246.52 → 2247.02] fantastic.
[2247.32 → 2248.88] Low persistence is cool, man.
[2249.04 → 2249.26] Yeah,
[2249.26 → 2250.18] and low persistence
[2250.18 → 2251.02] on top of that
[2251.02 → 2251.70] is going to turn
[2251.70 → 2253.18] the LCD gaming experience
[2253.18 → 2254.22] into finally,
[2254.46 → 2255.40] legitimately better
[2255.40 → 2257.08] than a CRT gaming experience.
[2257.20 → 2257.36] Yeah.
[2257.76 → 2258.62] You know how people
[2258.62 → 2259.26] were talking about...
[2259.26 → 2260.34] So many years later.
[2260.60 → 2261.42] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2261.70 → 2262.84] This is totally
[2262.84 → 2264.40] off-topic completely,
[2264.66 → 2265.06] but you know how
[2265.06 → 2265.50] people were talking
[2265.50 → 2266.10] about how our office
[2266.10 → 2266.50] was dirty
[2266.50 → 2267.30] in the Office Tour video?
[2267.70 → 2268.14] Yes.
[2268.40 → 2269.12] Have you seen
[2269.12 → 2269.92] Palmer's office?
[2270.34 → 2270.70] No.
[2271.28 → 2272.46] Oh my god.
[2273.28 → 2274.00] There's just, like,
[2274.10 → 2275.56] the side of his desk,
[2275.94 → 2276.36] there's, like,
[2276.38 → 2278.12] an angled pile of garbage
[2278.12 → 2279.64] that goes all the way up
[2279.64 → 2280.56] and touches the top
[2280.56 → 2281.06] of his desk
[2281.06 → 2282.04] on both sides,
[2282.16 → 2283.12] and then on both sides
[2283.12 → 2283.56] of the door,
[2283.66 → 2284.32] there's just, like,
[2284.88 → 2285.60] stuff.
[2286.02 → 2286.84] And none of it's, like,
[2286.90 → 2287.58] none of it necessarily
[2287.58 → 2288.18] looks like you should
[2288.18 → 2288.74] throw it away.
[2289.08 → 2290.82] It's just stuff.
[2291.12 → 2292.60] Just all over the place.
[2292.76 → 2293.72] The whole top of his desk,
[2293.78 → 2294.80] there's a laptop sitting,
[2294.92 → 2295.90] like, angled on top
[2295.90 → 2296.60] of a bunch of books
[2296.60 → 2297.36] and other crap.
[2297.36 → 2299.24] Is the top of his desk
[2299.24 → 2300.28] worse than my desk
[2300.28 → 2301.32] was back at NCI?
[2301.70 → 2302.76] You remember the piles
[2302.76 → 2303.62] of paper that I used
[2303.62 → 2304.38] to have on my desk,
[2304.42 → 2304.44] right?
[2304.44 → 2305.48] I think they're, like,
[2306.06 → 2306.70] I don't know,
[2306.76 → 2307.24] because I didn't get,
[2307.34 → 2308.24] like, a top-down view.
[2308.48 → 2309.66] I got it from the side,
[2310.06 → 2311.66] but that's got to be
[2311.66 → 2312.32] one of the closest
[2312.32 → 2313.92] to your desk I've ever seen.
[2314.04 → 2315.34] Like, it's insanity.
[2315.84 → 2316.22] And there's, like,
[2316.22 → 2317.20] an interview going on
[2317.20 → 2317.44] in there,
[2317.46 → 2317.96] and he's just like,
[2318.02 → 2318.56] yeah, whatever,
[2318.68 → 2319.38] I don't even care.
[2319.82 → 2321.60] The number of people...
[2321.60 → 2323.20] 8K is just a number.
[2323.20 → 2325.82] The number of people
[2325.82 → 2326.46] telling us,
[2326.78 → 2327.96] or asking why we didn't
[2327.96 → 2328.72] clean up the office
[2328.72 → 2329.72] before we did a tour.
[2330.18 → 2331.06] Oh, you guys.
[2332.20 → 2333.52] The number of hours
[2333.52 → 2334.48] that went into cleanup
[2334.48 → 2335.98] before that tour happened.
[2336.14 → 2336.40] Huge.
[2337.82 → 2338.76] You wouldn't have even
[2338.76 → 2339.82] believed this place.
[2339.96 → 2340.94] There was, like,
[2341.02 → 2341.52] okay, here,
[2341.70 → 2342.22] I'm going to put this
[2342.22 → 2343.22] in perspective for a minute.
[2343.82 → 2345.46] All that stuff in the garage
[2345.46 → 2347.48] was in the house, okay?
[2347.64 → 2347.84] Yeah.
[2347.96 → 2348.72] So that's step one.
[2348.90 → 2349.68] Step number two,
[2350.16 → 2351.44] all the shelves,
[2351.44 → 2352.96] the one in Luke's office,
[2353.20 → 2354.20] and the ones downstairs
[2354.20 → 2355.30] for the camera equipment
[2355.30 → 2356.44] were in the house.
[2356.64 → 2357.08] Oh, sorry,
[2357.16 → 2358.00] we didn't have.
[2358.76 → 2359.56] So all of that
[2359.56 → 2360.12] was on the floor.
[2360.14 → 2360.72] Yeah, the table
[2360.72 → 2361.76] that was out in the garage,
[2361.88 → 2362.44] that's just, like,
[2362.60 → 2363.72] a dining room table
[2363.72 → 2364.88] that has, like,
[2365.02 → 2366.68] pedestal-style feed under it,
[2366.70 → 2367.16] so there's, like,
[2367.18 → 2368.12] not really any room under it.
[2368.28 → 2369.50] That was what we were using
[2369.50 → 2370.42] in place of where
[2370.42 → 2371.78] Brandon's shelf is.
[2372.00 → 2372.60] So, like,
[2372.66 → 2373.24] all the stuff
[2373.24 → 2374.08] that's on that shelf
[2374.08 → 2375.28] was either on that,
[2375.58 → 2376.08] under it,
[2376.12 → 2377.04] or on the floor
[2377.04 → 2378.48] in the fastest possible
[2378.48 → 2379.24] green screen area.
[2379.64 → 2379.96] Sometimes,
[2380.18 → 2380.84] when we had to shoot
[2380.84 → 2381.74] as fast as possible,
[2382.08 → 2382.74] we legit
[2382.74 → 2383.60] had to, like,
[2383.78 → 2384.94] rearrange the piles
[2384.94 → 2385.84] of stuff on the floor
[2385.84 → 2386.66] so the lights
[2386.66 → 2387.28] could illuminate
[2387.28 → 2388.42] the green screen correctly.
[2389.24 → 2390.54] You guys have no idea.
[2390.62 → 2391.24] Like, it's actually,
[2391.70 → 2392.82] everyone around here
[2392.82 → 2393.82] has been marvelling lately
[2393.82 → 2394.60] at how easy it is
[2394.60 → 2395.30] to work right now.
[2395.38 → 2396.00] It's, it's,
[2396.06 → 2396.92] it's quite amazing.
[2397.38 → 2398.30] You can walk
[2398.30 → 2399.02] in a straight line
[2399.02 → 2400.44] for at least two seconds
[2400.44 → 2401.42] without running into anything.
[2401.64 → 2401.90] Yeah.
[2402.08 → 2403.14] Or tripping on something.
[2403.14 → 2404.38] Shuffling your foot forward
[2404.38 → 2405.72] would have run into something.
[2405.80 → 2407.26] I think Brandon's agility
[2407.26 → 2408.30] has levelled up
[2408.30 → 2409.60] at least six levels
[2409.60 → 2410.80] since he started working here
[2410.80 → 2411.76] because that guy,
[2412.22 → 2412.90] he almost ended up
[2412.90 → 2413.26] He's calling cables.
[2413.46 → 2414.26] He almost ended up
[2414.26 → 2415.20] with the nickname cables.
[2415.48 → 2416.24] If we hadn't started
[2416.24 → 2417.20] calling him B-roll
[2417.20 → 2418.20] before we started
[2418.20 → 2419.06] calling him cables,
[2419.30 → 2420.10] he would have been cables
[2420.10 → 2420.70] for sure
[2420.70 → 2421.82] because that guy,
[2422.28 → 2423.30] when he first started
[2423.30 → 2423.86] working here,
[2424.02 → 2425.46] you put a cable in a room,
[2425.62 → 2426.38] he would trip over it.
[2426.38 → 2426.62] Oh yeah.
[2427.30 → 2427.78] 100%.
[2427.78 → 2429.10] Like the number of times
[2429.10 → 2430.86] he has almost destroyed
[2430.86 → 2432.68] the Sony FS700 camera,
[2432.76 → 2433.88] the $8,000 camera.
[2433.94 → 2434.40] It's amazing.
[2434.50 → 2435.38] I can probably count
[2435.38 → 2436.58] on more than one hand
[2436.58 → 2437.60] because of like
[2437.60 → 2438.56] tripping on something
[2438.56 → 2439.94] or hooking it on something
[2439.94 → 2440.56] and like,
[2440.86 → 2441.22] and then,
[2441.28 → 2441.66] oh man,
[2441.68 → 2442.40] there's this one time
[2442.40 → 2443.08] when he didn't lock
[2443.08 → 2443.94] the tripod head.
[2444.02 → 2444.56] Oh no.
[2444.60 → 2445.00] And it,
[2445.00 → 2446.80] it was going down so fast
[2446.80 → 2447.34] that I,
[2447.42 → 2449.02] I swear the lens mount
[2449.02 → 2449.78] would have broken
[2449.78 → 2450.32] or something
[2450.32 → 2451.06] and then he's like,
[2451.06 → 2451.26] oh,
[2451.32 → 2452.00] and he caught it.
[2453.12 → 2453.56] Oh.
[2454.30 → 2454.70] Uh,
[2454.82 → 2455.18] yeah,
[2455.28 → 2456.10] and like he,
[2456.10 → 2456.96] he's learned the
[2456.96 → 2457.76] the foot flick
[2457.76 → 2458.14] Yeah,
[2458.22 → 2458.66] the foot flick.
[2458.68 → 2459.36] Which most nerds
[2459.36 → 2459.90] that I know,
[2460.14 → 2460.42] know,
[2460.72 → 2461.56] which is when you're like
[2461.56 → 2462.28] walking across
[2462.28 → 2463.10] and you trip on
[2463.10 → 2464.44] traditionally an Ethernet cable
[2464.44 → 2465.42] but it could be anything.
[2465.50 → 2465.92] Could be power.
[2465.98 → 2467.16] Your foot goes under it
[2467.16 → 2468.72] and then you fall forward,
[2468.92 → 2469.92] whip your foot back
[2469.92 → 2471.12] and then slam it forward
[2471.12 → 2472.26] so that you can land
[2472.26 → 2473.12] and you're okay.
[2473.34 → 2474.08] You look kind of weird
[2474.08 → 2474.70] but you're okay
[2474.70 → 2476.02] but it doesn't pull on the cable.
[2476.16 → 2477.08] We should do a guide.
[2477.56 → 2478.28] We should do a guide.
[2478.28 → 2479.06] We should do a guide.
[2479.68 → 2480.44] How to navigate,
[2480.74 → 2480.90] like,
[2481.16 → 2482.32] we noticed a lot of you
[2482.32 → 2483.00] were upset about
[2483.00 → 2483.78] the number of cables
[2483.78 → 2484.40] in our office.
[2485.08 → 2485.80] Let's show you
[2485.80 → 2486.54] a little trick.
[2486.54 → 2487.50] It's called
[2487.50 → 2488.32] the foot flick.
[2488.64 → 2489.38] The foot flick.
[2489.38 → 2490.20] That would be awesome.
[2490.82 → 2491.56] It should be like
[2491.56 → 2492.32] a music video.
[2493.72 → 2494.66] I've always kind of
[2494.66 → 2495.92] wanted to do a music video.
[2496.76 → 2497.84] Everybody do the foot flick.
[2497.94 → 2498.98] Everybody do the foot flick.
[2501.76 → 2502.98] That would be fantastic.
[2503.24 → 2503.50] All right,
[2503.54 → 2503.66] well,
[2503.66 → 2504.40] we should probably do
[2504.40 → 2505.30] our sponsor spots
[2505.30 → 2505.68] or something
[2505.68 → 2506.64] at some point here.
[2507.14 → 2508.18] Brought to you by foot flick.
[2508.32 → 2509.46] Brought to you by foot flick.
[2509.90 → 2510.38] Squarespace,
[2510.86 → 2511.96] the number one website
[2511.96 → 2513.30] for creating a website
[2513.30 → 2514.44] about foot flicks.
[2514.54 → 2514.96] Just go to
[2514.96 → 2516.12] squarespace.com,
[2516.42 → 2517.04] sign up,
[2517.14 → 2517.82] and you can have
[2517.82 → 2518.92] your website online
[2518.92 → 2521.02] in just a matter of no time.
[2521.10 → 2521.82] It'll look great
[2521.82 → 2522.54] on the desktop,
[2522.82 → 2523.86] great on the notebook,
[2524.10 → 2524.58] which is basically
[2524.58 → 2525.12] the same thing,
[2525.34 → 2526.60] and great on your tablet
[2526.60 → 2527.30] and smartphone
[2527.30 → 2528.08] because the way
[2528.08 → 2529.14] that their templates work
[2529.14 → 2530.36] makes it super easy
[2530.36 → 2531.06] to get set up
[2531.06 → 2532.12] and something
[2532.12 → 2533.56] I always forget to mention.
[2533.82 → 2535.36] They have 24-7 tech support.
[2535.98 → 2536.16] Yeah.
[2536.28 → 2537.18] I always forget about this.
[2537.24 → 2537.80] That is actually
[2537.80 → 2538.60] a huge deal.
[2538.60 → 2539.00] It is.
[2539.06 → 2540.10] It's not phone support,
[2540.24 → 2540.52] mind you,
[2540.58 → 2541.74] but you can email them,
[2541.86 → 2542.50] and I've actually,
[2542.92 → 2544.22] I had my mom try them,
[2544.62 → 2545.50] and even though
[2545.50 → 2546.72] my mom still didn't
[2546.72 → 2547.78] manage to figure it out,
[2548.24 → 2549.50] I read the responses
[2549.50 → 2550.82] and they were super helpful
[2550.82 → 2552.84] and really fast,
[2552.92 → 2553.52] and I was just like,
[2553.60 → 2553.84] Ma,
[2554.40 → 2556.72] you have to read it.
[2557.36 → 2559.04] You can't just get an email
[2559.04 → 2560.44] from an internet company,
[2560.78 → 2561.66] assume you're not going
[2561.66 → 2562.54] to be able to read it,
[2562.58 → 2563.36] and then call me.
[2563.66 → 2565.16] You have to try to read it.
[2565.88 → 2567.50] They explain.
[2567.50 → 2569.08] If you just read the thing.
[2569.46 → 2569.76] Anyway,
[2570.20 → 2571.04] my mother aside,
[2571.14 → 2573.24] Squarespace is super easy
[2573.24 → 2573.74] to use,
[2573.94 → 2574.80] super scalable,
[2575.48 → 2576.60] and apparently,
[2577.14 → 2578.06] based on how much
[2578.06 → 2579.04] positive feedback
[2579.04 → 2580.80] I get about Squarespace,
[2581.10 → 2581.90] you guys love it.
[2582.32 → 2582.56] So,
[2582.70 → 2583.56] the number of people
[2583.56 → 2585.34] that have just sent me tweets
[2585.34 → 2586.44] thanking me
[2586.44 → 2588.52] for the 10% off,
[2588.60 → 2589.52] so if you head over to
[2589.52 → 2590.30] squarespace.com
[2590.30 → 2590.94] slash Linus
[2590.94 → 2592.22] and use offer code Linus,
[2592.26 → 2593.38] you can save 10%.
[2593.38 → 2594.28] So,
[2594.38 → 2595.04] people thanking me
[2595.04 → 2596.12] for the 10% off
[2596.12 → 2597.00] and people telling me
[2597.00 → 2598.04] how much they love it
[2598.04 → 2599.60] and how easy it is to use
[2599.60 → 2600.98] compared to WordPress
[2600.98 → 2602.50] or other services like that.
[2602.58 → 2603.60] You can set up a portfolio,
[2603.94 → 2604.86] you can set up a blog,
[2605.12 → 2606.64] you can set up even a web store,
[2606.74 → 2608.22] so they have an e-commerce module,
[2608.56 → 2609.36] and it's all,
[2609.80 → 2611.36] compared to actually coding
[2611.36 → 2612.52] a website from scratch,
[2612.58 → 2614.36] it's basically drag and drop
[2614.36 → 2615.42] to the point where
[2615.42 → 2616.80] our designer did
[2616.80 → 2618.00] LinusMediaGroup.com
[2618.00 → 2619.60] as opposed to having him
[2619.60 → 2621.28] do LinusMediaGroup.com.
[2621.28 → 2621.84] So,
[2622.08 → 2623.42] they've got their logo designer,
[2623.84 → 2625.18] they've got their tech support,
[2625.36 → 2625.92] they've got the fact
[2625.92 → 2626.88] that it's easy to use,
[2627.14 → 2628.24] and the fact that
[2628.24 → 2629.66] you can just hit it
[2629.66 → 2630.48] as hard as you want,
[2630.66 → 2631.66] and the plans are very,
[2631.76 → 2632.24] very scalable,
[2632.46 → 2633.32] and they don't go down.
[2633.46 → 2633.68] So,
[2634.04 → 2634.62] there you go, guys.
[2634.66 → 2635.54] Squarespace.com.
[2635.60 → 2636.68] We absolutely love it,
[2636.96 → 2638.38] and the discount,
[2638.50 → 2639.06] 10%,
[2639.06 → 2639.48] yes,
[2639.60 → 2640.60] it is just a number.
[2643.40 → 2643.84] Thanks,
[2643.94 → 2644.18] Squarespace.
[2644.44 → 2645.48] We appreciate you guys.
[2645.56 → 2646.18] We love you,
[2646.44 → 2647.68] and inside joke
[2647.68 → 2648.80] for whoever from Squarespace
[2648.80 → 2651.18] is watching this,
[2651.28 → 2653.46] right now.
[2662.40 → 2663.64] I think that's pretty much
[2663.64 → 2664.76] the end of the joke there.
[2664.84 → 2664.94] So,
[2665.02 → 2666.18] let's move on to our next,
[2666.18 → 2667.84] our next monster message.
[2667.94 → 2668.42] You weren't there.
[2668.44 → 2669.44] I have no idea
[2669.44 → 2670.22] what just happened.
[2670.30 → 2671.30] Total inside joke.
[2671.32 → 2671.60] Okay.
[2672.18 → 2672.62] He's gonna,
[2672.68 → 2673.70] he's going to freak out.
[2674.46 → 2675.30] He's going to be like,
[2675.38 → 2675.52] dude,
[2675.58 → 2675.82] really?
[2675.82 → 2676.82] Okay,
[2677.56 → 2680.30] so the Asus G750JZ.
[2680.46 → 2682.24] As far as gaming laptops
[2682.24 → 2683.92] goes with Go,
[2684.18 → 2685.26] without getting into
[2685.26 → 2686.28] the ones that are,
[2686.34 → 2686.56] like,
[2686.64 → 2687.28] so thick,
[2687.38 → 2687.98] they legitimately
[2687.98 → 2689.60] don't fit into backpacks.
[2689.66 → 2690.08] In fact,
[2690.34 → 2691.20] I actually have
[2691.20 → 2693.06] Asus's purpose-built,
[2693.12 → 2693.92] what did I just drop?
[2694.50 → 2695.46] Hopefully nothing important.
[2696.12 → 2696.40] Nope.
[2696.40 → 2698.44] So I have Asus's purpose-made
[2698.44 → 2699.42] DOG laptop
[2699.42 → 2700.46] that actually goes
[2700.46 → 2701.88] with the G750JZ,
[2702.00 → 2703.14] or any other similar
[2703.14 → 2704.40] Asus gaming notebook
[2704.40 → 2705.16] that's also,
[2705.60 → 2706.42] well,
[2706.56 → 2707.00] this size.
[2707.50 → 2708.88] Where was I going with this?
[2709.02 → 2709.22] Right,
[2709.32 → 2709.52] yes,
[2709.58 → 2709.80] so,
[2710.04 → 2710.98] it's the gaming laptop
[2710.98 → 2712.16] that without going into
[2712.16 → 2713.70] kind of the ludicrous specs
[2713.70 → 2714.94] is pretty much as good
[2714.94 → 2715.62] as you can get.
[2716.00 → 2716.40] It's got...
[2716.40 → 2717.40] I got...
[2717.40 → 2718.54] Why are you just
[2718.54 → 2719.66] listing off rappers?
[2720.56 → 2720.84] Oh,
[2720.90 → 2722.08] I didn't even mean to.
[2724.44 → 2726.12] I was doing so good.
[2727.52 → 2729.04] I will give you 50 cents
[2729.04 → 2729.66] to go away.
[2733.06 → 2733.82] I'm sorry,
[2733.96 → 2734.40] I had to.
[2735.02 → 2735.32] Oh,
[2735.32 → 2735.72] man.
[2735.72 → 2735.82] Oh,
[2735.82 → 2736.26] man.
[2736.34 → 2737.72] I was doing so good,
[2737.80 → 2738.92] and then he said ludicrous,
[2739.00 → 2739.76] and I was just like,
[2739.86 → 2740.14] boom.
[2740.14 → 2742.62] You've completely derailed me.
[2744.30 → 2744.66] Okay,
[2745.14 → 2745.52] so,
[2745.52 → 2747.50] I'm trying to talk about
[2747.50 → 2748.56] this laptop here.
[2748.66 → 2748.78] So,
[2748.86 → 2749.92] without getting into the ones
[2749.92 → 2751.08] that are absolutely crazy,
[2751.18 → 2752.02] run crazy hot,
[2752.08 → 2752.96] and get like 30 minutes
[2752.96 → 2753.80] of battery life,
[2754.12 → 2755.30] the G750JZ
[2755.30 → 2756.34] is about as powerful
[2756.34 → 2757.10] as you can get.
[2757.20 → 2758.26] The onboard graphics,
[2758.56 → 2758.72] I mean,
[2758.80 → 2758.98] okay,
[2759.02 → 2759.60] I shouldn't say onboard.
[2759.70 → 2760.64] The built-in graphics
[2760.64 → 2762.76] are a GTX 880M,
[2762.84 → 2763.52] which is actually
[2763.52 → 2764.28] about equivalent
[2764.28 → 2766.80] to a GTX 770 desktop card,
[2766.98 → 2768.36] and then the onboard CPU,
[2768.72 → 2769.54] onboard CPU,
[2769.54 → 2770.32] why am I even saying
[2770.32 → 2770.76] these things?
[2770.86 → 2771.18] You just,
[2771.66 → 2772.28] you threw me
[2772.28 → 2773.18] for a loop here.
[2773.18 → 2775.92] I was doing so good.
[2776.00 → 2776.90] I lifted my laptop,
[2777.02 → 2777.80] I put it back down,
[2777.98 → 2778.80] I sat here,
[2778.92 → 2779.32] I just like,
[2779.38 → 2780.28] looked around in the background,
[2780.60 → 2781.50] and then ludicrous.
[2781.54 → 2781.72] Alright,
[2781.80 → 2781.90] well,
[2781.94 → 2782.94] I'm just going to have to
[2782.94 → 2784.04] make my way through this
[2784.04 → 2785.06] as best I can here.
[2785.14 → 2785.28] So,
[2785.34 → 2786.60] the cooling is fantastic,
[2787.00 → 2788.20] good enough that we can actually
[2788.20 → 2789.10] run these laptops
[2789.10 → 2790.30] on our laps,
[2790.64 → 2790.90] and you-
[2790.90 → 2791.26] Wow,
[2791.38 → 2793.36] I just got the 50 cent reference.
[2793.36 → 2796.18] I didn't get it till now.
[2796.18 → 2796.24] I didn't get it till now.
[2808.24 → 2809.08] Oh,
[2810.04 → 2810.66] that was good.
[2811.26 → 2811.66] Okay.
[2812.16 → 2812.56] Okay.
[2813.08 → 2813.76] Can we,
[2813.90 → 2815.32] do we have our composure?
[2815.72 → 2815.88] Yeah.
[2816.72 → 2817.60] Okay.
[2818.10 → 2818.94] Alright.
[2819.68 → 2820.42] This laptop
[2820.42 → 2821.94] is very powerful.
[2821.94 → 2823.28] It's portable,
[2823.68 → 2824.62] it's fast,
[2824.76 → 2826.04] it runs really cool,
[2826.40 → 2827.26] it's high quality
[2827.26 → 2828.46] because it's made by Asus,
[2828.58 → 2830.22] it's got a great overall
[2830.22 → 2831.26] fit and finish to it.
[2831.32 → 2832.34] We found that it's great
[2832.34 → 2833.24] for video editing,
[2833.58 → 2834.74] it's great for gaming,
[2835.06 → 2836.68] it has a surprisingly
[2836.68 → 2839.12] excellent price to performance ratio
[2839.12 → 2841.38] compared to thin and light gaming notebooks,
[2841.56 → 2843.06] and even compared to a desktop.
[2843.32 → 2844.60] It's not as far off
[2844.60 → 2846.72] as we've traditionally seen in the past.
[2846.72 → 2849.28] You should check out the G750JZ
[2849.28 → 2850.60] if you need something
[2850.60 → 2851.08] that is,
[2851.40 → 2852.80] while not super thin and light,
[2853.12 → 2853.82] still portable,
[2854.12 → 2854.72] and will deliver
[2854.72 → 2856.54] a truly great gaming experience.
[2856.96 → 2857.16] I mean,
[2857.20 → 2857.86] we were able to run
[2857.86 → 2859.20] Bios hock Infinite on Ultra,
[2859.44 → 2859.96] you were able to run
[2859.96 → 2860.60] pretty much everything
[2860.60 → 2861.26] you threw at it.
[2861.32 → 2861.50] Yeah,
[2861.54 → 2861.80] actually.
[2862.12 → 2863.34] Desktop grade specs.
[2863.34 → 2865.30] I did find normal benchmarking sets
[2865.30 → 2866.46] for good graphics cards,
[2866.64 → 2867.54] so maximum everything,
[2867.64 → 2867.78] essentially.
[2867.78 → 2867.92] Yeah,
[2868.12 → 2868.28] like,
[2868.50 → 2870.42] Luke has different presets
[2870.42 → 2871.48] for the games,
[2871.58 → 2872.86] depending on what kind of tier
[2872.86 → 2874.10] of product we're running.
[2874.10 → 2875.96] And so we were able to run
[2875.96 → 2876.46] all of the
[2876.46 → 2876.62] like,
[2876.74 → 2878.16] enthusiast class tiers,
[2878.52 → 2880.08] and without the laptop,
[2880.60 → 2882.78] something to tiers.
[2883.02 → 2884.10] I'm missing the word there.
[2884.68 → 2885.70] Bursting into tiers.
[2885.84 → 2885.98] Yeah, yeah.
[2886.26 → 2887.04] Although that would be,
[2887.04 → 2887.24] like,
[2887.32 → 2888.10] water-cooled.
[2889.98 → 2891.14] Next level laptops,
[2891.24 → 2892.02] they burst into tiers
[2892.02 → 2892.54] when you put them
[2892.54 → 2893.38] under performance.
[2893.50 → 2894.32] We need the snacks
[2894.32 → 2895.00] on this show.
[2895.32 → 2896.10] Do you have any M&M's?
[2896.44 → 2897.16] No, actually.
[2898.44 → 2898.88] Aww.
[2898.88 → 2899.12] Aww.
[2899.78 → 2901.04] Ha ha ha ha ha.
[2902.36 → 2903.42] Ha ha ha.
[2903.42 → 2904.54] I was like,
[2904.60 → 2904.78] what?
[2904.82 → 2905.42] Of course not.
[2905.48 → 2905.80] Ah.
[2906.80 → 2907.96] Oh my goodness.
[2908.74 → 2909.14] Aww.
[2909.96 → 2910.84] Yeah, okay.
[2911.02 → 2912.64] I was actually trying.
[2912.74 → 2912.96] I was like,
[2913.00 → 2914.86] I didn't prep my Jay-Z joke
[2914.86 → 2915.32] this week,
[2915.52 → 2916.18] which, like,
[2916.24 → 2917.06] needed some prep,
[2917.32 → 2917.74] so I was like,
[2917.78 → 2918.64] I'll just let him go,
[2918.76 → 2919.46] and this week will be
[2919.46 → 2920.12] a calm week,
[2920.18 → 2920.52] and then,
[2920.60 → 2920.84] nope,
[2921.10 → 2921.72] not at all.
[2922.32 → 2922.92] Not at all.
[2922.92 → 2923.88] He said ludicrous.
[2925.06 → 2926.50] I didn't even mean to
[2926.50 → 2927.28] on that one.
[2927.38 → 2927.74] I know, I know.
[2927.80 → 2929.34] I didn't even think of it.
[2929.90 → 2931.34] That wasn't even the spelling
[2931.34 → 2932.42] that was in my head.
[2932.52 → 2933.36] No, nope.
[2934.22 → 2934.68] All right,
[2934.74 → 2935.98] so posted on the forum
[2935.98 → 2937.00] by someone.
[2937.14 → 2937.30] Anyway,
[2937.40 → 2938.08] this is an article
[2938.08 → 2938.88] from Nantes.
[2939.18 → 2940.70] The Shield gets Portal
[2940.70 → 2942.12] and Half-Life 2,
[2942.54 → 2943.08] which, uh,
[2943.08 → 2943.24] here,
[2943.32 → 2943.98] if you want to run
[2943.98 → 2944.76] through this with everyone,
[2944.86 → 2945.68] I'm going to go get
[2945.68 → 2946.42] the like,
[2946.54 → 2947.92] epic NVIDIA swag
[2947.92 → 2948.98] that they sent over here.
[2949.10 → 2950.04] Where is it?
[2950.20 → 2950.80] Find it.
[2950.88 → 2951.22] It's a little bit
[2951.22 → 2951.82] higher up there.
[2951.88 → 2952.36] I don't think there's
[2952.36 → 2953.48] really actually that much
[2953.48 → 2954.08] to say.
[2954.28 → 2954.86] We can talk about
[2954.86 → 2955.84] how amazing it is.
[2956.08 → 2956.28] Yeah,
[2956.38 → 2957.56] it's kind of awesome.
[2957.70 → 2958.38] I really appreciate
[2958.38 → 2959.04] that they're bringing
[2959.04 → 2960.42] this back
[2960.42 → 2961.18] because, honestly,
[2961.38 → 2963.10] it's been a really long time
[2963.10 → 2963.96] since it came out,
[2964.02 → 2964.66] so you could probably
[2964.66 → 2965.38] play it again
[2965.38 → 2966.50] and it would be totally fine.
[2966.88 → 2968.00] And having it on the shield
[2968.00 → 2968.72] is definitely something
[2968.72 → 2969.20] where you could just
[2969.20 → 2970.04] play it while you're, like,
[2971.10 → 2971.78] going to bed.
[2971.78 → 2972.64] And it's not actually
[2972.64 → 2973.36] that big of a deal.
[2973.86 → 2974.72] If you get Portal
[2974.72 → 2975.74] and Half-Life 2 together,
[2975.86 → 2977.38] it's about $10 on Android,
[2977.52 → 2978.88] which is actually awesome
[2978.88 → 2979.54] because that's about
[2979.54 → 2980.34] the same price as they
[2980.34 → 2981.00] are on Steam,
[2981.22 → 2982.22] which is fantastic.
[2983.82 → 2985.16] This is just way too cool.
[2985.24 → 2985.86] We have to show this,
[2986.00 → 2986.44] like, now.
[2986.68 → 2987.32] Yeah, I know, right?
[2987.40 → 2988.36] I was so stoked
[2988.36 → 2989.04] when this came in.
[2989.10 → 2989.68] I guess he's got to
[2989.68 → 2990.28] get hooked up first.
[2990.96 → 2992.12] When it first launched,
[2992.16 → 2994.60] it ran on an ATI-X800 Pro
[2994.60 → 2995.60] or, uh,
[2995.68 → 2996.38] slash XT
[2996.38 → 2998.42] or NVIDIA 6800 Ultra
[2998.42 → 2999.10] or GT.
[2999.62 → 3000.86] And that Terra 4 chip
[3000.86 → 3001.76] should theoretically
[3001.76 → 3002.28] be faster.
[3002.64 → 3003.26] That's incredible.
[3003.44 → 3004.76] And that's not even
[3004.76 → 3005.78] Terra K1 yet.
[3006.26 → 3007.22] And Terra K1
[3007.22 → 3007.82] is, like,
[3007.90 → 3008.86] right around the corner.
[3009.06 → 3009.82] Yeah, they're already
[3009.82 → 3011.18] leaking stuff for Shield 2,
[3011.26 → 3012.06] which will be running it.
[3012.22 → 3013.62] Which is extremely exciting.
[3013.74 → 3014.52] So we're at the point
[3014.52 → 3015.74] where NVIDIA
[3015.74 → 3016.84] has done a lot
[3016.84 → 3017.66] of gum-flapping
[3017.66 → 3019.40] about, you know,
[3019.52 → 3020.62] console-grade gaming
[3020.62 → 3022.00] experience on mobile.
[3022.58 → 3023.82] But you look at
[3023.82 → 3024.88] how long they've been
[3024.88 → 3025.40] at this.
[3025.48 → 3026.12] Like, ever since
[3026.12 → 3026.76] the whole,
[3026.92 → 3028.14] the original Terra
[3028.14 → 3029.00] and the Terra 2,
[3029.10 → 3029.62] they've been saying,
[3029.94 → 3030.54] look, this is where
[3030.54 → 3031.34] we're trying to get to.
[3031.76 → 3034.22] It's actually
[3034.22 → 3034.74] kind of cool.
[3034.80 → 3036.02] It's actually happening.
[3036.22 → 3036.46] Yep.
[3037.02 → 3038.06] It's actually happening.
[3038.12 → 3038.88] And Half-Life 2
[3038.88 → 3039.66] is finally,
[3039.86 → 3040.60] like, Half-Life 2,
[3040.72 → 3041.12] Portal 2,
[3041.20 → 3041.70] this kind of stuff,
[3042.02 → 3042.74] they're actually games
[3042.74 → 3043.32] that I really
[3043.32 → 3044.22] legitimately want to
[3044.22 → 3044.92] play on the device.
[3044.92 → 3045.98] I mean, the funny thing
[3045.98 → 3046.92] is, as soon as I heard
[3046.92 → 3047.44] the announcement
[3047.44 → 3048.26] that Portal 2
[3048.26 → 3049.20] was going to be coming,
[3049.48 → 3050.98] I think two days prior
[3050.98 → 3052.00] I had finished playing
[3052.00 → 3053.12] Portal using Game Stream.
[3053.32 → 3054.04] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3054.08 → 3054.94] It's like, so yeah,
[3055.02 → 3055.96] I just played through,
[3056.02 → 3056.92] I played through
[3056.92 → 3057.88] the entire game
[3057.88 → 3058.92] on my Shield
[3058.92 → 3059.76] with Game Stream.
[3059.88 → 3060.38] And it was awesome.
[3060.38 → 3060.72] It was fine, right?
[3060.80 → 3061.80] Yeah, you didn't have
[3061.80 → 3062.44] any downsides.
[3062.44 → 3063.38] Didn't have any issues.
[3063.84 → 3064.32] But anyway.
[3064.38 → 3064.88] It was so cool.
[3064.96 → 3065.58] Okay, so this,
[3065.70 → 3066.70] this was sent to us
[3066.70 → 3067.32] from NVIDIA.
[3067.44 → 3068.28] They hadn't, like,
[3068.38 → 3069.54] given us any preparation
[3069.54 → 3071.70] for what it was
[3071.70 → 3072.04] going to have
[3072.04 → 3072.78] anything to do with.
[3072.84 → 3073.60] So it's basically
[3073.60 → 3076.42] just a painted crowbar.
[3076.98 → 3077.80] It came in, like,
[3077.84 → 3079.08] this enormous box
[3079.08 → 3079.98] with way too much
[3079.98 → 3081.52] anti-static bubble packaging.
[3081.80 → 3082.02] Yeah.
[3082.02 → 3083.32] I guess when you're NVIDIA,
[3083.46 → 3084.10] the only packaging
[3084.10 → 3084.96] you really have
[3084.96 → 3085.64] is anti-static.
[3086.64 → 3087.62] But there you go.
[3087.80 → 3088.20] So it's a
[3088.20 → 3089.12] What Would Gordon Do
[3089.12 → 3090.68] crowbar with a Half-Life 2
[3090.68 → 3093.00] Lambda and an NVIDIA
[3093.00 → 3094.04] Shield logo on it.
[3094.04 → 3095.42] So this is freaking cool.
[3095.76 → 3096.60] This will definitely
[3096.60 → 3097.92] live on the wall of epic
[3097.92 → 3098.86] that we need to recreate
[3098.86 → 3099.54] back here because
[3099.54 → 3100.76] we seriously need to
[3100.76 → 3101.62] redo the Land Show set.
[3101.62 → 3102.12] Oh, definitely.
[3102.42 → 3103.44] It's absolutely horrible.
[3103.44 → 3104.38] That's one of the
[3104.38 → 3105.40] the coolest pieces of swag
[3105.40 → 3106.74] I've, like, ever seen.
[3106.82 → 3106.98] Yeah.
[3107.16 → 3107.76] 100%.
[3107.76 → 3109.08] Pretty, pretty amazing.
[3109.08 → 3109.90] Whoever thought
[3109.90 → 3110.86] that was a good idea
[3110.86 → 3112.62] was on the money.
[3112.70 → 3113.82] Was not stupid.
[3114.02 → 3114.34] Nope.
[3114.74 → 3115.10] Yay!
[3115.22 → 3115.66] Yay!
[3115.84 → 3116.48] Good job!
[3117.12 → 3118.60] The Better Than Useless Award.
[3118.78 → 3119.82] The Not Stupid Award.
[3120.12 → 3121.00] That should be the only
[3121.00 → 3122.36] award that we can
[3122.36 → 3123.10] possibly give out.
[3123.10 → 3124.12] We should never have
[3124.12 → 3125.12] any other awards
[3125.12 → 3125.78] other than
[3125.78 → 3126.66] Better Than Worthless.
[3126.82 → 3127.90] Better Than Worthless.
[3128.10 → 3129.00] Or Better Than
[3129.00 → 3129.70] Better Than All
[3129.70 → 3130.72] the Terrible Words.
[3130.84 → 3131.26] Yeah, yeah.
[3131.32 → 3131.74] So we can just
[3131.74 → 3132.48] change whenever
[3132.48 → 3133.52] but it's essentially
[3133.52 → 3134.10] the same idea.
[3134.12 → 3135.20] Better Than Putting Nails
[3135.20 → 3135.90] in My Eye.
[3138.70 → 3140.14] Okay, so this article
[3140.14 → 3141.06] from Digital Journal.
[3141.18 → 3141.74] Honestly, it's not
[3141.74 → 3142.34] the best article
[3142.34 → 3143.10] I've ever read.
[3143.52 → 3144.14] And, uh,
[3144.18 → 3144.76] I don't know.
[3144.82 → 3145.54] Like, I hate to
[3145.54 → 3147.06] generalize about people
[3147.06 → 3148.16] but, like,
[3148.54 → 3149.22] this author
[3149.22 → 3150.32] needs a better portrait.
[3150.86 → 3151.86] James, if you're watching,
[3152.22 → 3154.34] dude, please.
[3154.76 → 3155.60] Like, it's like
[3155.60 → 3156.36] selfie bad.
[3157.08 → 3157.62] And it's like
[3157.62 → 3158.60] selfie, like,
[3158.66 → 3159.26] it looks like he took it
[3159.26 → 3159.76] on his webcam
[3159.76 → 3160.48] because you can see
[3160.48 → 3161.36] his screens reflected
[3161.36 → 3162.14] in his eyeglasses.
[3162.40 → 3162.68] Yeah.
[3163.10 → 3163.76] It's just like...
[3163.76 → 3164.66] Yeah, he must have too.
[3164.84 → 3165.52] Yeah, no, see?
[3165.64 → 3166.24] You can see, yeah.
[3166.28 → 3167.64] And like a ancient
[3167.64 → 3168.54] kind of crappy
[3168.54 → 3169.40] laptop webcam.
[3169.88 → 3170.86] Yeah, so James,
[3171.02 → 3172.18] please, please fix that.
[3172.18 → 3173.30] Um, I mean,
[3173.34 → 3174.80] it's not that bad.
[3174.98 → 3175.50] But, uh,
[3175.50 → 3175.92] basically,
[3176.22 → 3177.50] the point of the article,
[3177.80 → 3178.38] which is,
[3178.68 → 3179.10] you know, like,
[3179.18 → 3180.40] it's actually pretty thorough
[3180.40 → 3181.40] for all of my,
[3181.46 → 3182.18] for all of my criticisms,
[3182.44 → 3183.70] is that the NSA
[3183.70 → 3185.34] and GCHQ
[3185.34 → 3187.48] are working on Tor,
[3188.08 → 3188.52] basically.
[3188.72 → 3189.18] Yeah, yeah.
[3189.22 → 3190.40] And it is not
[3190.40 → 3191.98] as impenetrable
[3191.98 → 3193.30] as some people
[3193.30 → 3194.30] would like to believe.
[3194.38 → 3195.28] The main way
[3195.28 → 3196.16] that they are getting
[3196.16 → 3196.86] at your data
[3196.86 → 3198.00] and tracking you
[3198.00 → 3199.56] is through browser plugins,
[3199.88 → 3201.36] which still work with Tor.
[3201.36 → 3203.34] So, things like Flash
[3203.34 → 3204.10] and Java
[3204.10 → 3205.28] that are well known
[3205.28 → 3206.28] to have vulnerabilities
[3206.28 → 3210.22] that just are gaping.
[3210.38 → 3210.74] That being,
[3210.90 → 3212.34] that being said,
[3212.42 → 3212.82] a lot of people
[3212.82 → 3213.20] that I know
[3213.20 → 3213.96] that try and set up
[3213.96 → 3214.80] secure setups
[3214.80 → 3215.88] that aren't running
[3215.88 → 3217.02] Java or Flash
[3217.02 → 3217.78] and they're running
[3217.78 → 3218.26] a combination
[3218.26 → 3218.82] of other things.
[3218.90 → 3219.30] Like, there's,
[3219.40 → 3220.30] you have to have
[3220.30 → 3221.76] a whole suite of things.
[3221.76 → 3221.96] Well, yeah.
[3222.22 → 3222.74] And the thing is
[3222.74 → 3224.46] that most of the community
[3224.46 → 3225.94] that was using Tor already
[3225.94 → 3227.90] probably is doing that,
[3228.00 → 3228.90] but we're talking about
[3228.90 → 3230.40] more mainstream people
[3230.40 → 3230.86] No, exactly.
[3230.86 → 3231.92] hearing about Tor
[3231.92 → 3232.68] and kind of going,
[3232.78 → 3233.80] oh, but I still want
[3233.80 → 3234.88] to watch my YouTube videos.
[3235.08 → 3237.32] So, DA-da-da-da-da.
[3237.36 → 3238.08] If you're unsure
[3238.08 → 3239.18] about all that kind of stuff,
[3239.48 → 3240.48] look it up.
[3240.58 → 3241.16] There are guides
[3241.16 → 3241.74] on how to, like,
[3241.82 → 3243.06] properly set up your browser
[3243.06 → 3244.22] if you want to be anonymous.
[3244.72 → 3245.46] And it's still,
[3245.64 → 3246.80] you're still at a huge amount
[3246.80 → 3247.16] of risk,
[3247.28 → 3248.46] but it's going to be
[3248.46 → 3249.06] a lot better
[3249.06 → 3250.14] than just running Tor.
[3250.32 → 3251.30] So, the Tor network
[3251.30 → 3252.68] has not been cracked,
[3252.94 → 3254.36] but there are
[3254.36 → 3255.64] an increasing number
[3255.64 → 3258.08] of sites that are being hijacked,
[3258.42 → 3259.48] dot-dot-union sites
[3259.48 → 3260.44] that are being hijacked
[3260.44 → 3261.70] by law enforcement agencies
[3261.70 → 3263.50] and recording details
[3263.50 → 3264.28] of people
[3264.28 → 3265.66] that are visiting the sites
[3265.66 → 3266.30] and sending them
[3266.30 → 3266.82] to the NSA.
[3267.76 → 3269.42] So, there you go, guys.
[3269.90 → 3270.88] He, uh...
[3270.88 → 3271.08] Hmm.
[3271.52 → 3271.66] Hmm.
[3272.52 → 3272.96] Yeah.
[3272.96 → 3274.88] So, you're not safe anywhere.
[3275.92 → 3276.74] I'm beginning to think
[3276.74 → 3277.48] that my, like,
[3277.56 → 3279.08] technophobe sister
[3279.08 → 3279.94] might have been right
[3279.94 → 3280.68] about all of this.
[3281.20 → 3281.80] Like, she just,
[3282.02 → 3282.88] she didn't even want
[3282.88 → 3283.44] a smartphone,
[3283.82 → 3284.90] she doesn't want a computer,
[3285.50 → 3286.00] she's just like,
[3286.06 → 3286.68] nope, pen and paper.
[3287.42 → 3287.76] I was,
[3287.86 → 3288.70] when I was doing research
[3288.70 → 3289.40] for that video
[3289.40 → 3290.74] that I'm working on right now,
[3290.98 → 3292.08] I ran into something
[3292.08 → 3292.80] and I started asking
[3292.80 → 3293.54] questions about it
[3293.54 → 3293.86] and I was like,
[3293.88 → 3294.96] I feel like a tin hatter
[3294.96 → 3295.56] when I'm asking
[3295.56 → 3296.44] a few of these questions,
[3296.60 → 3296.98] but then,
[3297.62 → 3298.76] that's probably okay.
[3298.98 → 3299.24] Yeah.
[3299.94 → 3300.66] Because of what's
[3300.66 → 3301.44] been happening lately.
[3301.54 → 3302.66] That's probably entirely
[3302.66 → 3303.18] fine.
[3303.70 → 3304.44] And I might not even
[3304.44 → 3305.30] be that far off.
[3305.52 → 3307.06] So, I'm going to let
[3307.06 → 3308.00] you handle this.
[3308.14 → 3308.58] Are you sure?
[3308.70 → 3308.96] Yeah.
[3309.08 → 3309.70] I kind of want you
[3309.70 → 3310.50] to read through part of this.
[3310.52 → 3311.66] No, I don't really want to.
[3311.74 → 3312.30] You don't want to read
[3312.30 → 3312.60] through this?
[3312.62 → 3313.08] All right, go.
[3313.54 → 3314.92] Uh, so, Oculus Rift
[3314.92 → 3316.48] is being used to,
[3316.88 → 3318.66] or the idea of Oculus Rift
[3318.66 → 3319.54] is being used to give
[3319.54 → 3320.98] chickens a free-range
[3320.98 → 3321.80] style lifestyle.
[3322.40 → 3323.18] So, they set up
[3323.18 → 3323.90] an Oculus Rift,
[3323.98 → 3324.74] mix it in, like,
[3325.02 → 3326.62] a second-life kind of idea
[3326.62 → 3327.60] and then they can make
[3327.60 → 3328.38] the chicken think
[3328.38 → 3328.90] that even though
[3328.90 → 3329.94] it's confined into a coop,
[3330.02 → 3331.42] it actually has a free-range
[3331.42 → 3333.26] roaming identity.
[3337.90 → 3338.38] Really?
[3338.48 → 3339.20] VR for chickens?
[3340.20 → 3340.92] Like, really?
[3341.40 → 3342.70] What do you think about this?
[3342.70 → 3343.88] I think that
[3343.88 → 3345.38] as concepts go,
[3345.62 → 3346.68] it seems more like
[3346.68 → 3347.88] a publicity stunt
[3347.88 → 3349.34] for VR in general
[3349.34 → 3351.10] and less of a
[3351.10 → 3352.28] practical thing.
[3352.68 → 3352.98] I mean,
[3353.08 → 3354.56] we are so many
[3354.56 → 3356.18] bazillion years
[3356.18 → 3357.20] away from
[3357.20 → 3359.68] a product like Oculus
[3359.68 → 3360.96] being able to be
[3360.96 → 3361.74] miniaturized
[3361.74 → 3363.20] and costed down enough
[3363.20 → 3365.14] to put them
[3365.14 → 3365.80] on chickens.
[3366.32 → 3366.54] I mean,
[3366.64 → 3368.70] it's stupid.
[3369.46 → 3370.86] I want chickens
[3370.86 → 3371.92] to have good lives,
[3372.12 → 3373.36] but I don't think
[3373.36 → 3374.72] VR is the solution.
[3374.94 → 3375.92] Well, there are two things.
[3376.14 → 3377.08] One, I don't think
[3377.08 → 3377.68] it's actually going to
[3377.68 → 3378.32] give you the benefits
[3378.32 → 3378.92] of free-range
[3378.92 → 3379.60] because they're still
[3379.60 → 3380.42] confined to the thing.
[3380.42 → 3381.40] And a lot of free-range
[3381.40 → 3381.86] stuff is the fact
[3381.86 → 3382.44] that they can run around
[3382.44 → 3382.92] and all that kind of stuff.
[3383.20 → 3383.68] And two,
[3384.04 → 3385.78] it's not real.
[3386.82 → 3387.58] Oh, is this fake?
[3387.74 → 3388.00] Yeah.
[3388.18 → 3388.46] Okay.
[3388.62 → 3389.40] The whole point
[3389.40 → 3390.16] of the article
[3390.16 → 3391.32] was to see how many
[3391.32 → 3392.16] people they can convince.
[3392.52 → 3392.82] Okay.
[3392.88 → 3393.48] So I thought you had
[3393.48 → 3394.24] maybe seen that,
[3394.44 → 3395.42] but I don't think so anymore.
[3395.88 → 3397.38] But everyone watching,
[3397.78 → 3399.02] I bet a lot of people
[3399.02 → 3400.56] actually kind of thought
[3400.56 → 3401.70] that that was legit.
[3402.44 → 3403.24] And you know what?
[3403.80 → 3404.96] It maybe could be,
[3405.02 → 3406.28] but I read quite a few
[3406.28 → 3406.96] places that it's not.
[3406.96 → 3409.96] So, like, yeah.
[3410.14 → 3411.00] But that's bad.
[3411.08 → 3411.66] And the fact that
[3411.66 → 3413.46] that sounds super realistic
[3413.46 → 3415.26] is terrible.
[3416.80 → 3418.02] Because imagine how many
[3418.02 → 3418.94] people you could sell
[3418.94 → 3420.92] free-range chickens to.
[3424.48 → 3425.38] Next, they're just going to
[3425.38 → 3426.32] like strap a TV
[3426.32 → 3427.26] to the front of the cage
[3427.26 → 3428.02] and be like, yeah.
[3428.48 → 3429.02] Free-range.
[3429.02 → 3429.64] Free-range.
[3429.66 → 3430.86] It has like a field on it.
[3432.74 → 3434.00] They can see the field,
[3434.12 → 3434.74] which makes them think
[3434.74 → 3435.48] they're in the field.
[3436.58 → 3436.94] Done.
[3437.60 → 3437.98] All right.
[3438.08 → 3439.92] So I actually kind of,
[3440.00 → 3440.60] well, when we were
[3440.60 → 3442.66] supposed to have JJ on here,
[3442.76 → 3443.52] I kind of realized
[3443.52 → 3444.78] we have, like,
[3445.08 → 3446.18] barely talked about
[3446.18 → 3447.52] Intel's new Z97
[3447.52 → 3449.14] and H97 chipsets,
[3449.46 → 3450.62] like, at all.
[3450.82 → 3451.70] So as usual,
[3451.82 → 3452.76] Z versus H
[3452.76 → 3453.72] means that Z is
[3453.72 → 3454.44] overclockable
[3454.44 → 3455.84] and H is, uh,
[3455.86 → 3456.76] not so much.
[3457.16 → 3458.40] The 9-series chipsets
[3458.40 → 3459.38] offer increased
[3459.38 → 3460.36] data transfer speeds
[3460.36 → 3461.46] for storage drives,
[3461.52 → 3461.98] now supporting
[3461.98 → 3463.32] the M.2 specification,
[3463.78 → 3464.56] allowing them to drive
[3464.56 → 3466.36] two PCIe 2.0 lanes
[3466.36 → 3468.00] to the M.2 drive,
[3468.08 → 3468.72] giving it a total
[3468.72 → 3469.66] of about one gigabyte
[3469.66 → 3470.66] per second of bandwidth,
[3470.80 → 3471.42] compared to
[3471.42 → 3472.72] about 600 megabytes
[3472.72 → 3473.68] per second of bandwidth
[3473.68 → 3476.38] available over SATA 3.
[3477.06 → 3478.48] Um, okay.
[3478.72 → 3479.96] The same connectivity options
[3479.96 → 3480.88] are basically there.
[3480.96 → 3482.08] So 14 USB ports,
[3482.14 → 3482.70] six of which can be
[3482.70 → 3483.50] USB 3,
[3483.82 → 3484.94] up to six SATA 3,
[3485.20 → 3485.88] uh, six gig,
[3485.88 → 3486.88] or six gigabits per se,
[3486.88 → 3488.68] six gigabit per second ports,
[3489.00 → 3489.90] an integrated gigabit
[3489.90 → 3490.80] Ethernet controller,
[3490.80 → 3493.08] eight PCIe 2.0 lanes.
[3493.20 → 3493.92] I believe that's all
[3493.92 → 3494.76] off of the chipset
[3494.76 → 3495.36] because you have
[3495.36 → 3496.80] 16 lanes off of the CPU,
[3496.96 → 3497.98] something along those lines.
[3498.18 → 3499.16] They have upgraded
[3499.16 → 3500.38] smart response technology,
[3500.52 → 3501.22] SRT,
[3501.48 → 3502.26] so they're supporting
[3502.26 → 3503.22] hybrid hard drives
[3503.22 → 3504.42] with integrated flash storage.
[3504.52 → 3505.08] So previously,
[3505.08 → 3506.62] the feature required
[3506.62 → 3507.34] separate hard drives
[3507.34 → 3507.96] and SSDs
[3507.96 → 3509.48] on separate connectors.
[3509.70 → 3510.40] So I think there's
[3510.40 → 3511.30] one drive
[3511.30 → 3512.26] to which that's applicable,
[3512.52 → 3513.06] the, uh,
[3513.28 → 3514.62] WD Black Squared.
[3514.78 → 3515.00] Yeah.
[3515.48 → 3516.22] Um, okay.
[3516.52 → 3517.08] Bradwell,
[3517.08 → 3518.48] so new CPUs,
[3518.68 → 3520.20] like legitimate new CPUs
[3520.20 → 3520.92] are not coming
[3520.92 → 3522.42] until sometime next year,
[3522.50 → 3523.64] probably about a year from now.
[3523.96 → 3524.76] And those will bring
[3524.76 → 3525.72] a 30% increase
[3525.72 → 3526.44] in power efficiency
[3526.44 → 3527.14] and Z97,
[3527.40 → 3528.36] at least some of the boards
[3528.36 → 3529.36] are advertising
[3529.36 → 3530.60] that they will have support
[3530.60 → 3531.76] for Bradwell.
[3531.90 → 3532.42] In the meantime,
[3532.62 → 3534.00] we get Haswell Refresh
[3534.00 → 3536.04] as well as Devil's Canyon.
[3536.36 → 3537.74] So Intel has improved
[3537.74 → 3539.24] the thermal interface material
[3539.24 → 3540.06] on the CPUs
[3540.06 → 3541.06] so that they're going to run cooler.
[3541.48 → 3542.90] And the word on the street
[3542.90 → 3544.22] is that Z97 boards,
[3544.34 → 3545.50] even before we put
[3545.50 → 3546.44] overclockable Haswell
[3546.44 → 3547.56] refresh processors on them,
[3547.62 → 3548.36] are overclocking
[3548.36 → 3548.82] a little better
[3548.82 → 3550.04] and have the CPUs
[3550.04 → 3550.60] running cooler.
[3551.22 → 3552.38] And I think that is
[3552.38 → 3553.54] pretty much it,
[3553.72 → 3554.44] except, uh,
[3554.44 → 3555.40] we were supposed to have,
[3555.44 → 3556.26] we were supposed to have
[3556.26 → 3557.88] JJ on to talk about this stuff.
[3558.08 → 3559.30] He's an extremely busy man.
[3559.56 → 3560.08] I know, no,
[3560.16 → 3560.94] well, it's, it's true.
[3561.02 → 3562.08] He's like super crazy.
[3562.26 → 3563.06] Oh, oh, whoa,
[3563.14 → 3563.84] hey, there we go.
[3563.92 → 3564.72] Oh, just, oh,
[3565.50 → 3566.20] oh, oh,
[3566.20 → 3567.56] just got back to the office.
[3567.56 → 3568.22] Out of the office
[3568.22 → 3569.02] due to an emergency.
[3569.20 → 3569.64] It took longer
[3569.64 → 3570.50] at the event location.
[3570.64 → 3571.54] Just got back into the office.
[3571.62 → 3571.98] Okay, well,
[3572.28 → 3573.36] maybe we'll have him join us.
[3573.42 → 3574.12] I think we've only got
[3574.12 → 3575.26] about 10, 15 more minutes
[3575.26 → 3575.92] left on the show.
[3575.92 → 3577.60] So, guys, uh, you know,
[3577.86 → 3578.92] maybe what we'll do
[3578.92 → 3580.32] is we'll have JJ on next week.
[3580.40 → 3581.96] I can't, I can't say 100%
[3581.96 → 3582.70] because it'll depend
[3582.70 → 3583.34] on his scheduling,
[3583.52 → 3584.22] but I know you guys
[3584.22 → 3584.92] will probably want to hear
[3584.92 → 3586.60] from him about, um,
[3587.14 → 3588.14] what Asus has done
[3588.14 → 3589.58] that's amazing, uh,
[3589.58 → 3590.44] in the last little while.
[3590.62 → 3591.64] That is what you will hear.
[3591.78 → 3592.76] That is what you will hear.
[3592.88 → 3594.00] I mean, he's, uh,
[3594.18 → 3594.98] he's so knowledgeable,
[3594.98 → 3595.66] so, you know,
[3595.66 → 3596.48] I look forward to having him
[3596.48 → 3596.86] on the show.
[3596.92 → 3597.52] I wish he'd been able
[3597.52 → 3598.10] to make it this week,
[3598.14 → 3599.32] but there you go.
[3599.40 → 3600.38] While you get that loaded up,
[3600.40 → 3601.36] I have to call out a tweet.
[3601.50 → 3602.20] Some guy tweeted me,
[3602.20 → 3602.98] I bet you could get
[3602.98 → 3604.46] two packs of M&Ms
[3604.46 → 3605.48] for 50 cents.
[3605.68 → 3609.92] Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3610.12 → 3611.04] That was pretty good.
[3611.22 → 3612.54] He didn't fit Jay-Z in, though,
[3612.60 → 3613.44] so, I don't know.
[3613.98 → 3615.40] He can have three points.
[3616.10 → 3617.48] Three points, not ten points.
[3617.68 → 3617.82] Yeah.
[3617.92 → 3618.96] All right, posted on the forum
[3618.96 → 3620.18] by Alex Goes High,
[3620.30 → 3623.72] LG G3 press renders leaked.
[3624.00 → 3624.92] These look pretty sweet.
[3624.96 → 3626.92] And then the completely impartial
[3626.92 → 3628.96] and unbiased headline says,
[3628.96 → 3631.30] best looking phone of the year.
[3631.30 → 3633.00] So, here we go.
[3633.82 → 3636.50] Phone Arena was the original poster.
[3637.04 → 3637.90] I like the new design
[3637.90 → 3639.10] of the volume up, down,
[3639.16 → 3639.86] and power buttons.
[3640.24 → 3641.24] So, that's back here.
[3641.36 → 3644.04] Yeah, because the one thing
[3644.04 → 3644.68] I didn't like about
[3644.68 → 3645.46] the power button before
[3645.46 → 3646.66] was it was a strip.
[3647.24 → 3647.50] Right.
[3647.60 → 3648.08] Which wasn't,
[3648.16 → 3649.06] it was fine.
[3649.22 → 3649.98] Like, it wasn't a big deal.
[3650.04 → 3651.52] I didn't even bother bring it up
[3651.52 → 3653.36] because it didn't matter that much,
[3653.44 → 3654.64] but this does look nicer.
[3654.96 → 3655.92] So, I,
[3656.14 → 3657.66] we'll go through these renders.
[3657.66 → 3658.36] Like, okay,
[3658.54 → 3659.58] so there's a thing there
[3659.58 → 3660.70] and there's some stuff.
[3661.46 → 3661.68] Uh-huh.
[3661.82 → 3662.74] It reminds you a lot of that,
[3662.80 → 3663.10] doesn't it?
[3663.30 → 3663.70] Yeah.
[3664.10 → 3664.98] And why is everyone
[3664.98 → 3665.92] doing gold phones?
[3666.50 → 3666.90] Please stop.
[3666.90 → 3667.32] Like, can you,
[3667.42 → 3668.28] can everyone please
[3668.28 → 3669.82] stop following Apple?
[3670.56 → 3672.04] Like, what makes Apple a leader?
[3672.46 → 3673.50] The fact that everyone
[3673.50 → 3674.32] follows them.
[3676.02 → 3676.42] Wow.
[3677.46 → 3678.38] Like, and it's,
[3678.40 → 3679.54] and it's a stupid idea.
[3679.66 → 3680.92] I'm not being an Apple fanboy
[3680.92 → 3681.88] by calling them a leader.
[3682.04 → 3683.42] I think the idea was bad.
[3683.62 → 3685.26] I think the idea was bad
[3685.26 → 3686.40] and the people following it
[3686.40 → 3687.12] should feel bad.
[3687.12 → 3688.18] That's all I'm trying to say.
[3688.36 → 3688.86] Gold motherboards.
[3689.48 → 3690.86] Like, just stop it.
[3691.36 → 3692.38] Gold is gaudy.
[3692.84 → 3693.10] Yeah.
[3694.06 → 3694.66] I'm sorry.
[3695.76 → 3696.76] People with class
[3696.76 → 3697.52] wear white gold.
[3697.66 → 3698.42] Gold is awesome
[3698.42 → 3699.56] when it comes in, like,
[3699.64 → 3700.36] everyone, but.
[3700.62 → 3701.12] A metal.
[3701.70 → 3702.30] I'm sorry?
[3702.62 → 3703.26] Gold is awesome
[3703.26 → 3703.76] when it comes in, like,
[3703.78 → 3704.14] a metal.
[3704.22 → 3704.72] Yeah, like,
[3704.72 → 3705.42] if I had, like, a,
[3705.42 → 3706.28] if I had, like, a gold,
[3706.28 → 3707.62] if I had, like, a gold brick
[3707.62 → 3708.70] or, like,
[3708.90 → 3709.12] Yeah.
[3709.74 → 3710.10] something.
[3710.30 → 3711.36] I can't think of too many
[3711.36 → 3712.24] other things I would like
[3712.24 → 3713.48] to actually be yellow gold.
[3713.72 → 3714.72] Like, some sort of Boolean
[3714.72 → 3715.52] or a medal
[3715.52 → 3716.52] or a trophy.
[3716.84 → 3717.10] Yeah.
[3717.28 → 3718.18] All of that's super cool.
[3718.18 → 3719.26] Yeah, trophies should be gold.
[3719.46 → 3719.68] Yeah.
[3720.88 → 3722.16] I'll settle for brass.
[3722.26 → 3723.08] I've never won a trophy
[3723.08 → 3723.56] in my life,
[3723.60 → 3724.58] so I'd settle for any trophy,
[3724.66 → 3725.04] really, but.
[3725.44 → 3725.98] You know what?
[3726.08 → 3727.60] I don't know that I agree
[3727.60 → 3728.32] with the best phone
[3728.32 → 3728.94] of the year thing
[3728.94 → 3729.46] because,
[3729.86 → 3731.58] not because this looks better,
[3731.78 → 3732.92] but because it looks like
[3732.92 → 3734.12] the same damn thing.
[3734.52 → 3736.02] Like, it actually just doesn't
[3736.02 → 3737.22] really look any different to me.
[3737.44 → 3738.16] I don't,
[3738.16 → 3739.66] I don't see the difference.
[3740.16 → 3740.84] And maybe I'm just
[3740.84 → 3741.84] not picky enough,
[3742.28 → 3742.84] but, like,
[3743.42 → 3744.88] brushed metal back,
[3745.68 → 3746.20] um,
[3746.58 → 3747.62] I like how it looks,
[3747.70 → 3748.62] but you're not wrong.
[3748.86 → 3749.96] It looks pretty much the same.
[3750.18 → 3750.54] And,
[3750.82 → 3751.58] and I would,
[3751.72 → 3752.88] if everything else is equal,
[3752.96 → 3753.72] if they're the same price
[3753.72 → 3754.90] and they basically look the same,
[3755.12 → 3756.54] front-facing speakers, man,
[3757.04 → 3758.24] it is such a big deal
[3758.24 → 3759.06] and it is so disappointing.
[3759.06 → 3760.18] That was one of my complaints
[3760.18 → 3760.86] about the G3
[3760.86 → 3761.70] is if I held it
[3761.70 → 3763.22] in the right particular way,
[3764.08 → 3764.26] sorry?
[3764.46 → 3764.78] G2.
[3765.14 → 3766.08] G2, sorry, yeah, yeah.
[3766.12 → 3767.08] If I held it in the right
[3767.08 → 3768.30] or wrong way,
[3768.40 → 3769.38] it would cover up the speakers
[3769.38 → 3770.82] and essentially manually
[3770.82 → 3771.44] mute the phone.
[3771.60 → 3771.74] Yeah.
[3771.84 → 3772.82] Because I would be covering up
[3772.82 → 3773.10] the speakers
[3773.10 → 3773.88] and I couldn't hear it anymore.
[3774.02 → 3774.70] It was kind of annoying.
[3775.04 → 3775.28] Yeah.
[3775.44 → 3777.02] And another ergonomic thing
[3777.02 → 3778.06] that people might not necessarily
[3778.06 → 3778.82] agree with me about,
[3778.94 → 3780.28] but it's that I don't like
[3780.28 → 3781.20] bottom-mounted
[3781.20 → 3782.22] headphone jacks anymore.
[3782.50 → 3783.82] I complained about this
[3783.82 → 3785.02] in my 1M8 review,
[3785.12 → 3786.48] but I actually didn't properly
[3786.48 → 3787.86] explain what I don't like about it.
[3787.86 → 3789.46] Like I said...
[3789.46 → 3790.14] The car thing, right?
[3790.20 → 3790.42] Sorry?
[3790.68 → 3791.48] Is it the car thing?
[3791.56 → 3791.98] Car thing?
[3792.50 → 3794.46] Because you put your phone in...
[3794.46 → 3795.50] Oh, that's another reason,
[3795.58 → 3795.98] but no, that wasn't...
[3795.98 → 3797.12] I don't like it because of cars
[3797.12 → 3798.18] because if you plug your stuff
[3798.18 → 3798.68] in the bottom
[3798.68 → 3799.42] and you try and put it
[3799.42 → 3799.92] in a cupholder.
[3800.14 → 3801.32] Oh, that's another good point.
[3801.42 → 3801.56] Oh.
[3801.90 → 3803.30] Okay, no, I was talking about
[3803.30 → 3804.40] what's more natural for me
[3804.40 → 3805.28] to put it in my pocket
[3805.28 → 3807.02] so that I'm not putting
[3807.02 → 3807.86] strain on the connector.
[3808.92 → 3810.58] And so, and not just that,
[3811.02 → 3812.04] but that, because that,
[3812.12 → 3812.78] you could train yourself
[3812.78 → 3813.36] one way or the other,
[3813.50 → 3814.32] but I like to have it
[3814.32 → 3815.24] right side up in my pocket
[3815.24 → 3815.88] so I can pull it out
[3815.88 → 3816.26] of my pocket
[3816.26 → 3817.02] and glance at it.
[3817.02 → 3817.48] Oh, okay.
[3817.68 → 3818.82] And then the other thing
[3818.82 → 3820.32] that I didn't explain very well
[3820.32 → 3822.14] is that if you have something
[3822.14 → 3823.08] plugged into the bottom
[3823.08 → 3823.68] of the phone
[3823.68 → 3824.44] and you're using it
[3824.44 → 3825.10] right side up,
[3825.12 → 3825.98] it's kind of in your way.
[3826.52 → 3828.12] And not so much on the 1M8
[3828.12 → 3828.86] if you're right-handed
[3828.86 → 3830.62] because it could kind of
[3830.62 → 3831.26] come down here,
[3831.44 → 3833.08] but using the iPhone 5S,
[3833.16 → 3834.58] something I forgot to include
[3834.58 → 3835.26] in my review,
[3835.88 → 3837.18] where it's on the left,
[3837.80 → 3839.46] it sits right under my pinky.
[3840.20 → 3841.06] So when I'm typing,
[3841.44 → 3842.98] it's like right in the way,
[3843.50 → 3844.50] especially if you have
[3844.50 → 3845.48] a right angle connector
[3845.48 → 3846.42] on your headphones
[3846.42 → 3847.40] just like I do.
[3847.72 → 3848.56] Yeah, which isn't
[3848.56 → 3849.18] that uncommon.
[3849.38 → 3850.24] Both of these have it,
[3850.40 → 3850.84] actually.
[3851.38 → 3851.48] Yeah.
[3852.82 → 3853.86] Sony's CEO
[3853.86 → 3855.04] and executives
[3855.04 → 3857.10] are taking a 50% pay cut
[3857.10 → 3858.14] with no bonuses.
[3859.14 → 3860.14] They've lost money
[3860.14 → 3861.26] four out of the last
[3861.26 → 3862.18] five years.
[3862.48 → 3862.98] This was posted
[3862.98 → 3863.50] on the forum
[3863.50 → 3864.48] by TopWarGamer.
[3864.60 → 3865.46] The original article
[3865.46 → 3867.24] is from IGN.
[3867.76 → 3868.60] And I, yeah,
[3868.68 → 3868.94] you know what,
[3868.94 → 3869.48] TopWarGamer,
[3869.68 → 3870.58] I think you nailed it.
[3870.58 → 3871.66] I'm surprised
[3871.66 → 3872.68] it took you this long
[3872.68 → 3873.14] to do it.
[3873.18 → 3873.80] It's almost like
[3873.80 → 3875.36] a knee-jerk reaction
[3875.36 → 3876.70] to, oh, well,
[3876.76 → 3877.90] Nintendo's doing this.
[3878.00 → 3878.22] Yeah.
[3878.38 → 3879.34] Therefore, maybe that's
[3879.34 → 3880.42] the honourable thing to do.
[3881.40 → 3881.88] Okay.
[3882.42 → 3883.02] I mean,
[3883.12 → 3884.92] I don't understand
[3884.92 → 3887.48] why an executive
[3887.48 → 3888.74] gets a bonus
[3888.74 → 3889.88] if the company
[3889.88 → 3891.62] isn't hugely profitable.
[3891.82 → 3893.10] My favourite ones
[3893.10 → 3894.32] and read
[3894.32 → 3896.36] hate massively
[3896.36 → 3897.96] is when the company
[3897.96 → 3898.76] is like failing
[3898.76 → 3899.58] and going bankrupt
[3899.58 → 3900.60] and they're like,
[3900.72 → 3902.14] massive exiting bonus.
[3902.78 → 3903.00] Yeah.
[3903.10 → 3903.40] It's like,
[3903.54 → 3904.56] uh, no,
[3904.72 → 3905.88] that shouldn't be legal.
[3906.92 → 3907.94] I really,
[3908.10 → 3909.04] I really wish
[3909.04 → 3910.12] that, uh,
[3910.20 → 3911.04] this mobile site.
[3911.38 → 3911.70] Yeah,
[3911.76 → 3912.82] I wish this wasn't
[3912.82 → 3913.58] the mobile site.
[3913.68 → 3914.80] But aside from that,
[3915.00 → 3915.34] I mean,
[3915.34 → 3915.90] I, I,
[3916.02 → 3916.66] I don't know,
[3916.76 → 3917.50] I don't know how
[3917.50 → 3918.50] you can ever enforce
[3918.50 → 3919.08] something like that
[3919.08 → 3919.74] because it all just
[3919.74 → 3920.66] becomes like,
[3920.88 → 3921.50] you know,
[3921.72 → 3923.36] just like buddy club
[3923.36 → 3924.14] where it's like,
[3924.20 → 3924.38] yeah,
[3924.44 → 3925.70] let's all make lots of money.
[3925.70 → 3926.50] That sounds great.
[3926.56 → 3926.78] Yeah.
[3926.86 → 3928.54] I think that's a great idea too.
[3928.92 → 3929.56] Bonus for you.
[3929.68 → 3930.38] Bonus for you.
[3930.62 → 3931.58] Bonus is for everyone.
[3931.92 → 3932.70] But I,
[3932.70 → 3934.48] I just think it's wrong.
[3934.68 → 3936.68] I just think it is so wrong
[3936.68 → 3937.42] that when you are
[3937.42 → 3938.52] not making money,
[3939.08 → 3939.36] I mean,
[3939.36 → 3939.58] okay,
[3939.72 → 3941.46] it's one thing to,
[3942.22 → 3942.44] I mean,
[3942.46 → 3942.66] okay,
[3942.72 → 3942.90] I'll,
[3942.96 → 3943.44] I'll use,
[3943.56 → 3943.76] you know,
[3943.76 → 3944.52] the business terms
[3944.52 → 3946.50] to streamline your workforce
[3946.50 → 3947.92] and,
[3948.04 → 3948.44] you know,
[3948.62 → 3949.34] be profitable
[3949.34 → 3950.18] and make money
[3950.18 → 3951.58] because you cut a bunch of jobs.
[3952.82 → 3954.08] No one likes that,
[3954.28 → 3955.68] but I kind of get it.
[3955.70 → 3955.98] You get it.
[3956.16 → 3957.12] The company's profitable.
[3957.54 → 3958.18] You're still,
[3958.42 → 3959.76] you're maintaining your sales target.
[3959.88 → 3961.32] You're doing the company things
[3961.32 → 3962.22] that you need to do,
[3962.26 → 3963.34] which is to make money.
[3964.10 → 3965.20] It's another thing
[3965.20 → 3967.66] when you are cutting jobs
[3967.66 → 3969.12] or not cutting jobs.
[3969.20 → 3969.36] All right.
[3969.36 → 3969.58] Okay.
[3969.66 → 3969.78] It's,
[3969.84 → 3970.44] I guess it's better
[3970.44 → 3971.54] if you're not cutting jobs
[3971.54 → 3972.22] and,
[3972.36 → 3972.48] okay,
[3972.54 → 3972.66] no,
[3972.68 → 3972.96] hold on.
[3973.18 → 3973.74] If you are,
[3973.92 → 3976.50] we'll get there.
[3976.76 → 3977.40] We'll get there.
[3977.50 → 3977.68] Yeah.
[3977.82 → 3978.04] Yeah.
[3978.38 → 3978.56] So,
[3978.64 → 3978.80] right.
[3978.86 → 3979.66] So if you're making money,
[3979.66 → 3980.28] that's one thing.
[3980.50 → 3980.74] If you're,
[3980.78 → 3981.02] you know,
[3981.06 → 3981.52] cutting jobs
[3981.52 → 3982.50] or even not cutting jobs
[3982.50 → 3983.52] and you're not making money,
[3983.52 → 3984.62] you shouldn't be getting a bonus.
[3984.80 → 3985.00] Yeah.
[3985.06 → 3985.84] Because a bonus
[3985.84 → 3987.02] should be tied to performance.
[3987.30 → 3988.88] And if the company's not making money,
[3988.88 → 3989.82] then the leadership
[3989.82 → 3991.42] is not performing
[3991.42 → 3993.18] because leadership is responsible
[3993.18 → 3994.52] for everyone.
[3994.72 → 3995.12] Like,
[3995.20 → 3996.62] if he does something stupid,
[3997.04 → 3997.60] ultimately,
[3997.86 → 4000.16] who gets a cease and desist
[4000.16 → 4002.64] or who gets a complaint?
[4002.80 → 4003.66] It will be me
[4003.66 → 4005.58] because I'm responsible for him.
[4005.72 → 4007.20] So if he does something great,
[4007.30 → 4008.94] then I should get a bonus.
[4009.20 → 4010.26] But if he does something crappy,
[4010.62 → 4011.20] then I'm the one
[4011.20 → 4012.16] who has to deal with it
[4012.16 → 4012.98] because ultimately,
[4013.14 → 4014.52] I'm responsible for what he does.
[4014.62 → 4015.80] And that's how leadership works.
[4016.16 → 4017.34] That's what taking responsibility
[4017.34 → 4018.14] for things
[4018.14 → 4019.32] is supposed to look like.
[4019.76 → 4020.28] And so,
[4021.04 → 4021.86] I don't understand
[4021.86 → 4022.86] why it took so long
[4022.86 → 4024.06] and I'm frustrated
[4024.06 → 4025.00] that that's a thing
[4025.00 → 4025.96] and I guess I'm not really
[4025.96 → 4027.04] going anywhere with this now.
[4027.22 → 4027.48] But,
[4027.80 → 4028.54] the point is,
[4028.80 → 4029.48] thank you guys
[4029.48 → 4030.80] for tuning into the WAN Show.
[4031.18 → 4032.36] I hope you guys enjoyed it
[4032.36 → 4033.16] as much as we did.
[4033.28 → 4034.04] I'm surprised there's
[4034.04 → 4035.08] so many people watching.
[4035.28 → 4035.38] It's,
[4035.46 → 4036.32] the weather's beautiful here.
[4036.38 → 4037.42] Maybe the weather sucks there.
[4037.70 → 4038.26] In which case,
[4038.26 → 4039.04] I'm sorry to hear that.
[4039.30 → 4040.12] I think also,
[4040.42 → 4041.34] a bunch of finals ending.
[4041.62 → 4042.26] Ah, yes.
[4042.26 → 4043.56] I think there's still some more
[4043.56 → 4045.28] coming a little bit later.
[4045.46 → 4046.68] If you guys have finals
[4046.68 → 4047.40] later than this,
[4047.90 → 4048.42] I'm sorry.
[4048.56 → 4049.12] Holy crap,
[4049.20 → 4049.82] that sucks.
[4050.46 → 4051.06] But yeah,
[4051.18 → 4051.76] thank you everybody
[4051.76 → 4052.40] for tuning in.
[4052.52 → 4052.96] That was awesome.
[4053.22 → 4053.46] Alright,
[4053.58 → 4054.22] peace out guys.
[4055.80 → 4056.56] Someone will get it.
[4068.26 → 4069.06] Peace out.
[4076.50 → 4076.64] Thanks.
[4079.08 → 4079.72] See you something else.
[4079.72 → 4080.32] Bye.
[4080.36 → 4081.06] Bye.
[4081.10 → 4081.44] Bye.
[4081.80 → 4082.12] Bye.
[4082.14 → 4082.20] Bye.
[4082.24 → 4082.34] Bye.
[4082.48 → 4083.06] Bye.
[4083.10 → 4085.60] Bye.
[4085.60 → 4087.98] Bye.
[4088.06 → 4088.60] Bye.
[4090.66 → 4091.00] Bye.
[4091.08 → 4091.14] Bye.
