[0.00 --> 3.68]  Oh, I should change the name of the stream before I broadcast.
[3.68 --> 5.88]  I never do that.
[5.88 --> 7.60]  Do you have it set up to tweet for you?
[7.60 --> 8.60]  After party?
[8.60 --> 9.60]  No, I don't think so.
[9.60 --> 10.60]  Oh, okay.
[10.60 --> 15.36]  I do the tweet with the YouTube announcement, which I never forget to pull down when the
[15.36 --> 16.36]  show's over.
[16.36 --> 17.36]  That's pretty quick.
[17.36 --> 18.36]  Sorry?
[18.36 --> 19.36]  You remember it pretty quick.
[19.36 --> 20.36]  Or always forget.
[20.36 --> 22.16]  No, no, the last couple weeks I've left it up for hours.
[22.16 --> 23.16]  No, I mean this time.
[23.16 --> 24.28]  Yeah, this time I'm getting it.
[24.28 --> 25.28]  Yeah.
[25.28 --> 28.28]  I always forget to pull down the tweet.
[28.28 --> 29.28]  Manergy.
[29.28 --> 32.76]  The Facebook post and the video.
[32.76 --> 38.52]  Because everyone is like, hey Linus, the WAN Show archive is broken.
[38.52 --> 40.16]  I clicked on it and it's private.
[40.16 --> 43.72]  I'm like, no, that was the announcement video.
[43.72 --> 45.20]  Just like last week.
[45.20 --> 46.20]  Same that time, same that channel.
[46.20 --> 49.80]  Just like last week and last week and last week and the week before last, last, last week.
[49.80 --> 51.52]  For two entire years.
[51.52 --> 52.52]  Chocolate!
[52.52 --> 57.06]  Did you say chocolate?
[57.06 --> 60.54]  Because that is a successful business idea right there.
[60.54 --> 61.54]  Okay.
[61.54 --> 62.54]  Okay.
[62.54 --> 66.30]  You know how there's like the jelly beans where some of them taste bad?
[66.30 --> 68.78]  Some of the chocolate shocks you.
[68.78 --> 69.78]  Haha!
[69.78 --> 73.78]  How would it even do that?
[73.78 --> 75.54]  Just have like a little battery inside?
[75.54 --> 76.54]  Yeah.
[76.54 --> 77.54]  It'd be horrible.
[77.54 --> 78.54]  Consuming batteries.
[78.54 --> 79.54]  And like you wouldn't eat that one.
[79.54 --> 80.54]  Someone would though.
[80.54 --> 81.54]  Because it would shock you.
[81.54 --> 82.54]  Someone would.
[82.54 --> 83.54]  There'd be a liability.
[83.54 --> 84.54]  I know.
[84.54 --> 87.54]  This company would go under like immediately.
[87.54 --> 89.54]  It would be super fun while it existed.
[89.54 --> 90.54]  Yeah.
[90.54 --> 91.54]  I would buy chocolate for everyone.
[91.54 --> 92.54]  Haha!
[92.54 --> 94.02]  I'd be down.
[94.02 --> 95.02]  I just...
[95.02 --> 97.02]  Some idiot's gonna be like, ugh, whatever.
[97.02 --> 98.02]  I was really stupid.
[98.02 --> 99.02]  Like the odds...
[99.02 --> 103.52]  The odds should be high enough that like you're pretty uncertain if it's gonna get you.
[103.52 --> 107.42]  Like you know when you... you know when you lick a 9-volt battery to find out if it's
[107.42 --> 108.42]  still good?
[108.42 --> 109.42]  Yeah.
[109.42 --> 110.42]  You're not...
[110.42 --> 111.42]  Yeah.
[111.42 --> 113.42]  Because it hurts enough that you're not a big fan of it.
[113.42 --> 114.42]  No.
[114.42 --> 115.42]  But it's not a big deal.
[115.42 --> 116.42]  Yeah.
[116.42 --> 117.42]  That's how chocolate should work.
[117.42 --> 120.42]  It should be like a 50-50 chance that it's gonna like shock your mouth.
[120.42 --> 121.42]  There should be...
[121.42 --> 122.42]  Okay.
[122.42 --> 125.56]  You know how like no one really gives a crap about terms of service and like the little
[125.56 --> 127.78]  check boxes that you have to do whenever you sign up for anything?
[127.78 --> 128.78]  Uh huh.
[128.78 --> 131.42]  Like they don't even hold up in court and they shouldn't even exist and they're stupid?
[131.42 --> 132.42]  Yeah.
[132.42 --> 135.48]  There should be one that's just like, this will hurt you.
[135.48 --> 136.48]  Please check to acknowledge.
[136.48 --> 137.48]  Haha!
[137.48 --> 138.48]  Just like...
[138.48 --> 143.48]  And then it actually does stand up in court and then you can do stuff like chocolate.
[143.48 --> 145.48]  And it's like, this is dangerous.
[145.48 --> 146.48]  Don't buy this.
[146.48 --> 147.48]  Check box buy.
[147.48 --> 148.48]  And then it's okay.
[148.48 --> 149.48]  Well it works for cigarettes.
[149.48 --> 150.48]  Haha!
[150.48 --> 151.48]  It did!
[151.48 --> 153.48]  That's exactly it!
[153.48 --> 154.48]  And those kill you.
[154.48 --> 156.48]  They do more than just shock your mouth.
[156.48 --> 157.48]  Yeah.
[157.48 --> 158.48]  So if the Surgeon General dictates...
[158.48 --> 159.48]  Oh man.
[159.48 --> 162.48]  Like mandates that chocolate has to have a warning label that it's gonna hurt you.
[162.48 --> 165.48]  Like on the label it can show like an electrocuted body.
[165.48 --> 166.48]  Yeah.
[166.48 --> 168.48]  And just be like, this could be you!
[168.48 --> 169.48]  Don't eat chocolate!
[169.48 --> 171.48]  And then you just buy that box and it's fine.
[171.48 --> 174.48]  Hopefully it's in a sleeve so you can just take the gross sleeve off.
[174.48 --> 175.48]  Kids today!
[175.48 --> 176.48]  You lick batteries?
[176.48 --> 177.48]  Yeah!
[177.48 --> 179.48]  That's how you find out if a 9 volt has a good charge in it.
[179.48 --> 180.48]  You lick the terminals.
[180.48 --> 181.48]  Everyone does that.
[181.48 --> 182.48]  No.
[182.48 --> 183.48]  Not everyone.
[183.48 --> 184.48]  We do that.
[184.48 --> 185.48]  Yeah.
[185.48 --> 188.48]  When you say everyone you mean you would live through that.
[188.48 --> 190.48]  I think most people just plug it in.
[190.48 --> 191.48]  Oh!
[191.48 --> 192.48]  Oh!
[192.48 --> 193.48]  This is a good idea.
[193.48 --> 196.48]  Ah-pickness, whatever how I pronounce that.
[196.48 --> 199.48]  Chocolate should be kinda Russian roulette-y.
[199.48 --> 202.48]  So it should have 12 squares and only one of them shocks the user.
[202.48 --> 203.48]  What?
[203.48 --> 209.48]  So every bar has a shock in it somewhere.
[209.48 --> 214.48]  And then it could be like a, oh man it could come in with like, you know how you used to
[214.48 --> 216.48]  get like different candies and stuff that would come with jokes?
[216.48 --> 217.48]  Yeah.
[217.48 --> 222.48]  It would just come with instructions to like do a roulette wheel spin thing.
[222.48 --> 228.48]  So like, oh if you like place them on the wrapper in this orientation and then like spin the wrapper or something.
[228.48 --> 230.48]  You can like play roulette with your friends.
[230.48 --> 231.48]  Shock roulette.
[231.48 --> 236.48]  What if it was pitched as like a coffee alternative?
[236.48 --> 237.48]  A coffee alternative?
[237.48 --> 239.48]  You just have a piece of chocolate and-
[239.48 --> 241.48]  So it literally electrocutes you?
[241.48 --> 243.48]  I don't know if that's really kinda fast.
[243.48 --> 245.48]  Oh you can't have that powerful of a battery in it.
[245.48 --> 246.48]  Come on.
[246.48 --> 249.48]  I don't know, I think we're gonna try.
[249.48 --> 257.48]  Like obviously it's not gonna work but we're gonna give it a good old try.
[257.48 --> 260.48]  He just said a bar so if you can get like a square thing.
[260.48 --> 261.48]  You can give it a good old college try.
[261.48 --> 262.48]  Half a diesel.
[262.48 --> 264.48]  Kill everyone with small batteries in their chocolate.
[264.48 --> 265.48]  Yeah.
[265.48 --> 267.48]  But they're signing the waiver.
[267.48 --> 268.48]  Don't buy this.
[268.48 --> 269.48]  It will hurt you.
[269.48 --> 270.48]  Alright.
[270.48 --> 272.48]  I like that waiver.
[272.48 --> 277.48]  So, I should have had that on your employee agreement.
[277.48 --> 278.48]  Yeah.
[278.48 --> 279.48]  Don't sign this.
[279.48 --> 280.48]  Don't sign this.
[280.48 --> 281.48]  It will be bad for you.
[281.48 --> 282.48]  Don't sign this.
[282.48 --> 286.48]  You will gain weight and you will work way too many hours.
[286.48 --> 293.48]  Alright, so the main goal of the after party today is for you guys to hit me up on Twitter
[293.48 --> 298.48]  and to a lesser extent Twitch chat just cause it's a lot harder for me to monitor.
[298.48 --> 300.48]  Oh wow, there's a chocolate store.
[300.48 --> 301.48]  Oh.
[301.48 --> 303.48]  Oh yeah, but that's Chocolat.
[303.48 --> 305.48]  That's not chocolate.
[305.48 --> 306.48]  Yeah.
[306.48 --> 307.48]  It's very different.
[307.48 --> 308.48]  Chocolat.
[308.48 --> 309.48]  Someone linked it.
[309.48 --> 311.48]  I was like, oh wow.
[311.48 --> 312.48]  It looks really nice.
[312.48 --> 313.48]  That's the French version.
[313.48 --> 315.48]  I would never buy any of it.
[315.48 --> 317.48]  Albie says tell Nick I said hi.
[317.48 --> 318.48]  Hi Albie.
[318.48 --> 325.48]  Alright, so we were gonna talk about the campaign.
[325.48 --> 329.48]  So, we already covered a little bit of the stuff about it.
[329.48 --> 336.48]  Um, we didn't really talk much about the Keep On Digging shirts on the show today, did
[336.48 --> 337.48]  we?
[337.48 --> 341.48]  I asked you to take your sweaters off when you were doing the Ubisoft part.
[341.48 --> 342.48]  Oh yeah, okay.
[342.48 --> 343.48]  Sorry, we should probably...
[343.48 --> 345.48]  There wasn't a ton of, like they didn't...
[345.48 --> 346.48]  Yeah, they didn't really dig.
[346.48 --> 347.48]  That's okay.
[347.48 --> 348.48]  They'll do something next week for sure.
[348.48 --> 349.48]  Oh, I know.
[349.48 --> 350.48]  100%.
[350.48 --> 351.48]  It'll happen.
[351.48 --> 353.48]  So anyway, we got the mockups.
[353.48 --> 358.48]  I posted this on Instagram already, but we got the mockups for our Keep On Digging shirts,
[358.48 --> 362.48]  which I think are actually among the sharpest designs we've had so far.
[362.48 --> 363.48]  Mine doesn't really fit that well.
[363.48 --> 368.48]  Yeah, well they sent all mediums for our proofs instead of sending a variety of sizes, so
[368.48 --> 370.48]  you could actually fit it.
[370.48 --> 371.48]  But this is how it should fit.
[371.48 --> 373.48]  It's American Apparel, so the sizing should be...
[373.48 --> 374.48]  They're nice shirts.
[374.48 --> 375.48]  Should be pretty straightforward.
[375.48 --> 376.48]  Yeah, super nice shirts.
[376.48 --> 378.48]  Um, and then those are on...
[378.48 --> 380.48]  They're comfy, it just doesn't fit.
[380.48 --> 382.48]  Comfy, it just doesn't fit.
[382.48 --> 384.48]  The material is comfy.
[384.48 --> 386.48]  Slash, keep on digging.
[386.48 --> 392.48]  So I'll post the link to that in the forum here, without an HTTP, so that I span it.
[392.48 --> 395.48]  Everyone's ragging us for our crowdfunding thing.
[395.48 --> 398.48]  Star Citizen just hit $63 million.
[398.48 --> 400.48]  Well, yes.
[400.48 --> 402.48]  We should build spaceships then.
[402.48 --> 403.48]  Yeah, let's just...
[403.48 --> 404.48]  Yeah, we should just 3D model like...
[404.48 --> 405.48]  Lennis Spaceship Group.
[405.48 --> 407.48]  3D model janky spaceships and be like,
[407.48 --> 409.48]  you can be the proud owner of the 3D model...
[409.48 --> 411.48]  This might exist in the game at some point.
[411.48 --> 417.48]  Yeah, the SketchUp model of this, that you can print on your 3D printer at home.
[417.48 --> 421.48]  If you buy it before it exists at all in any capacity, you get LTI!
[421.48 --> 427.48]  Oh, apparently Keep On Diggin' is at $420 sold.
[427.48 --> 430.48]  So now no one's gonna buy it, just so that it can stay there for a bit.
[430.48 --> 433.48]  Who do you think was the person who originally posted that in chat?
[433.48 --> 434.48]  You?
[434.48 --> 437.48]  It was you, wasn't it?
[437.48 --> 439.48]  Yeah, I just think it's funny.
[439.48 --> 440.48]  What a fool.
[440.48 --> 441.48]  Yeah, it's $420 sold.
[441.48 --> 445.48]  That's okay, we just talked about it, so I'm sure it'll hit $421 and you can just get back to work.
[445.48 --> 450.48]  We're already slightly over 21% to our next goal.
[450.48 --> 451.48]  Are we really?
[451.48 --> 452.48]  Yeah.
[452.48 --> 453.48]  Wow.
[453.48 --> 454.48]  What are we going to do?
[454.48 --> 458.48]  I guess moving the goals and making them all much easier makes it start to hit them faster.
[458.48 --> 459.48]  It's more fun!
[459.48 --> 460.48]  Yeah, it's a lot more fun.
[460.48 --> 463.48]  Well that was the way I wanted it to work anyway.
[463.48 --> 466.48]  We just, I mean, I already explained this during the show, but we just kind of...
[466.48 --> 468.48]  And I think, I think like...
[468.48 --> 469.48]  Fit the other way.
[469.48 --> 474.48]  I haven't even talked to you about this, but I think it's hard to like think about those numbers properly
[474.48 --> 482.48]  when you are focusing on massive metric numbers of like, what's all the money I can like sacrifice everything to acquire?
[482.48 --> 484.48]  And then what is the things I need to buy?
[484.48 --> 487.48]  And then you have to break down stuff into small numbers.
[487.48 --> 490.48]  For this, like it's probably hard to translate.
[490.48 --> 491.48]  Yeah, I mean, that's...
[491.48 --> 501.48]  I think, sorry, what Luke means more is like the total cost of this is so much that, you know, we kind of look at the crowdfunding and go,
[501.48 --> 509.48]  okay, well, if we look at it in terms of the scale of how much this investment is total, then we end up with these numbers that are really, really high.
[509.48 --> 510.48]  Yeah.
[510.48 --> 518.48]  Whereas if we make it something that's just fun and attainable, then I think that's going to be a much better community engagement exercise anyway.
[518.48 --> 519.48]  Yeah, it's more fun for everybody.
[519.48 --> 530.48]  And what's really cool about this setup right now that I like a lot is, say, if we had exactly $20,000 and someone went absolutely balls to the wall crazy,
[530.48 --> 536.48]  which I don't even expect anyone to do, and bought a $10,000 tier, it would unlock so much stuff.
[536.48 --> 537.48]  Like five tiers.
[537.48 --> 539.48]  Like, that's kind of cool.
[539.48 --> 542.48]  Because they get more than just the, I don't know, I'm just talking.
[542.48 --> 544.48]  So I'm linking the new office thing.
[544.48 --> 548.48]  Nexus asks, what kind of a space are you looking into getting?
[548.48 --> 550.48]  So warehouse office.
[550.48 --> 555.48]  It would be about a third office and about two thirds warehouse.
[555.48 --> 564.48]  And then the warehouse, we would need to kind of subdivide, build rooms within rooms for noise isolation between the sets from each other.
[564.48 --> 571.48]  And then also from the echoes in the warehouse, because the last thing we want to do is end up in a situation like NCIX,
[571.48 --> 577.48]  where they're in a warehouse that doesn't have any echo reduction strategy in place.
[577.48 --> 579.48]  And the audio in there is awful.
[579.48 --> 580.48]  Yeah.
[586.48 --> 590.48]  Someone asks, so your viewers have to pay the, put the bill for your wants.
[590.48 --> 591.48]  No, they don't have to do anything.
[591.48 --> 592.48]  That's the idea.
[592.48 --> 594.48]  We're not limiting anything in any way.
[594.48 --> 598.48]  I mean, every contributor campaign we've ever done has been purely voluntary.
[598.48 --> 605.48]  And we've actually positioned it so you don't really get any special benefit over someone who just watches the content.
[605.48 --> 610.48]  We try to set up, we talk about free to play games on the show a lot.
[610.48 --> 616.48]  And one thing that I bring up a lot is that there's very wrong ways to do free to play games.
[616.48 --> 621.48]  And that's one of the reasons why I don't like any free to play MMO is because I don't really think there's a lot of free to play games.
[621.48 --> 625.48]  Because I don't really think there's a right way to do that because you're just going to break something.
[625.48 --> 629.48]  Or, well, so far I think pretty much everyone has broken something.
[629.48 --> 635.48]  But games like League, where it's cosmetic stuff, I think personally works.
[635.48 --> 637.48]  So a lot of our campaigns are largely cosmetic stuff.
[637.48 --> 643.48]  You'll get a badge, maybe you'll get your name in something, maybe you can get a bobble head if you feel like that.
[643.48 --> 647.48]  Like you can get cool cosmetic-y style things, it's just not in a game.
[647.48 --> 649.48]  Someone asks how much does buying a shirt help?
[649.48 --> 651.48]  I think in the neighborhood of $10.
[651.48 --> 653.48]  So, yeah, it helps a lot.
[653.48 --> 655.48]  To keep on digging shirts, I think it's a little more than that.
[655.48 --> 656.48]  A little more?
[656.48 --> 659.48]  The more that we sell, the more benefit we get per shirt.
[659.48 --> 660.48]  So there you go.
[660.48 --> 666.48]  So if we sell a thousand of them, then the margin gets a little bit more the higher it goes.
[666.48 --> 668.48]  We view it, it's over $10 at that point.
[668.48 --> 671.48]  Right now it's hovering around $10, $11.
[671.48 --> 674.48]  We started making shirts because we wanted certain ones.
[674.48 --> 675.48]  Yeah.
[675.48 --> 679.48]  We were trying to find an affordable way to acquire shirts for the company.
[679.48 --> 681.48]  But whatever.
[681.48 --> 686.48]  We haven't still made the shirt that we were originally looking into shirt companies for, have we?
[686.48 --> 687.48]  What was that?
[687.48 --> 688.48]  The Mod Team one.
[688.48 --> 689.48]  Master... no.
[689.48 --> 691.48]  Yeah, we still haven't made that shirt.
[691.48 --> 693.48]  Because we can't find someone to make a super cool one.
[693.48 --> 694.48]  Right.
[694.48 --> 695.48]  We'll figure that out.
[695.48 --> 696.48]  We're not working on that.
[696.48 --> 697.48]  I know.
[697.48 --> 698.48]  It's just one of the things.
[698.48 --> 701.48]  I really want a Mod Team shirt, but I want it to be awesome.
[701.48 --> 702.48]  Like I don't want it to be...
[702.48 --> 706.48]  It's one of those things that's like, well we want it now, but there's this other thing
[706.48 --> 708.48]  that needs to be done like yesterday.
[708.48 --> 709.48]  Yeah.
[709.48 --> 710.48]  So...
[710.48 --> 713.48]  I was trying to explain to Nick about how I need an Arda asset for that thing that I'm
[713.48 --> 714.48]  planning to do for the forum.
[714.48 --> 715.48]  Yeah.
[715.48 --> 716.48]  For the contributors.
[716.48 --> 720.48]  And I was like, we need to do it now.
[720.48 --> 721.48]  And he's like, no we'll do it tomorrow.
[721.48 --> 723.48]  I was like, it won't happen tomorrow.
[723.48 --> 724.48]  At all.
[724.48 --> 727.48]  Yeah, but my point was it wasn't happening today either.
[727.48 --> 728.48]  So...
[728.48 --> 729.48]  Yeah.
[729.48 --> 730.48]  We've got a lot of people...
[730.48 --> 731.48]  That was true.
[731.48 --> 734.48]  We've got a lot of people talking about how much they like the kitchen set.
[734.48 --> 735.48]  What?
[735.48 --> 736.48]  That was crazy.
[736.48 --> 737.48]  Are you guys insane?
[737.48 --> 738.48]  It's horrible.
[738.48 --> 739.48]  I think it's just like...
[739.48 --> 740.48]  The evil you know.
[740.48 --> 741.48]  No.
[741.48 --> 744.48]  We will put up something way better than that.
[744.48 --> 745.48]  Right.
[745.48 --> 746.48]  The kitchen set is awful.
[746.48 --> 751.48]  The only reason we use it is because it's the only part of this entire building where
[751.48 --> 755.48]  there's enough room to have the lights so that the set is lit correctly.
[755.48 --> 756.48]  That's the only reason we use it.
[756.48 --> 757.48]  It's awful.
[757.48 --> 758.48]  We can do so much better than that.
[758.48 --> 759.48]  It's even like hard to work with.
[759.48 --> 760.48]  Yeah.
[760.48 --> 762.48]  I think people are worried that Linus Tech Tips is going to become like a white space set,
[762.48 --> 763.48]  which it's not.
[763.48 --> 764.48]  No, it's not.
[764.48 --> 765.48]  It's not even close.
[765.48 --> 766.48]  No, it's not.
[766.48 --> 767.48]  It's not even close.
[767.48 --> 768.48]  No, it's not.
[768.48 --> 769.48]  It's going to be an awesome set that's like actually...
[769.48 --> 774.48]  We would want something like techy and geeky looking.
[774.48 --> 775.48]  Something that fits the show.
[775.48 --> 776.48]  Not a kitchen.
[776.48 --> 777.48]  Not a kitchen.
[777.48 --> 778.48]  The kitchen has nothing to do with anything.
[778.48 --> 781.48]  The first time we used the kitchen was for a build guide.
[781.48 --> 785.48]  And the only reason we used it was because there wasn't enough space on the regular set
[785.48 --> 786.48]  to do a build guide there.
[786.48 --> 790.48]  And then we switched back over there because the lighting was not enough space to do a build
[790.48 --> 791.48]  guide there.
[791.48 --> 795.48]  And then we switched back over there because the lighting was so much better.
[795.48 --> 797.48]  And Brandon wouldn't let me...
[797.48 --> 801.48]  He basically filled the other space with clutter so I couldn't move anything back there.
[801.48 --> 803.48]  Yeah, yeah, it's absolutely true.
[803.48 --> 804.48]  He did.
[804.48 --> 806.48]  Brandon has subtle ways of getting what he wants.
[806.48 --> 807.48]  I was just going to do this.
[807.48 --> 810.48]  I'm going to make this incredibly inconvenient for you.
[810.48 --> 812.48]  People get attached to strange stuff.
[812.48 --> 816.48]  Like the old Linus Tech Tips intro with the box falling.
[816.48 --> 818.48]  Dude, when we stopped filming...
[818.48 --> 819.48]  When we stopped using it?
[819.48 --> 820.48]  Yeah.
[820.48 --> 821.48]  People freaked.
[821.48 --> 822.48]  That was nuts.
[822.48 --> 825.48]  When we first implemented it, people freaked.
[825.48 --> 827.48]  They hated it.
[827.48 --> 829.48]  People hate change every time.
[829.48 --> 832.48]  And then we took it away and they were like, what are you doing?
[832.48 --> 835.48]  You took away my intro that I hated?
[835.48 --> 837.48]  I'm like, oh, sorry.
[837.48 --> 841.48]  I do plan to keep the Mario karts in the back of the set.
[841.48 --> 842.48]  Of a set.
[842.48 --> 843.48]  Maybe not Linus Tech Tips.
[843.48 --> 845.48]  Maybe Channel Super Fun or something.
[845.48 --> 846.48]  Yeah.
[846.48 --> 847.48]  Bernie says, keep the kitchen.
[847.48 --> 855.48]  It makes you look like a geek startup that's too lazy to do anything else.
[855.48 --> 856.48]  Right.
[856.48 --> 857.48]  That is not...
[857.48 --> 858.48]  That's something we want to portray.
[858.48 --> 859.48]  ...the objective.
[859.48 --> 863.48]  The kitchen said it's so peaceful though.
[863.48 --> 865.48]  I liked the kitchen because it's unique.
[865.48 --> 866.48]  I kind of like the kitchen.
[866.48 --> 868.48]  All these Twitter comments!
[868.48 --> 873.48]  You should change one of your goals to do a WAN show with gay band masks.
[873.48 --> 874.48]  Is that like...
[874.48 --> 877.48]  Is that erecting false, you know, idols?
[877.48 --> 878.48]  Is it actually a sin?
[878.48 --> 880.48]  Yeah, I don't think we can do that.
[880.48 --> 881.48]  Yeah.
[881.48 --> 882.48]  I wouldn't want to do that.
[882.48 --> 884.48]  It has to be like...
[884.48 --> 887.48]  If we were to do something like that, it would have to be a tribute.
[887.48 --> 888.48]  Not a mockery.
[888.48 --> 891.48]  So it would have to be something like the statue.
[891.48 --> 892.48]  Good.
[892.48 --> 893.48]  That was good.
[893.48 --> 894.48]  We're live by the way.
[894.48 --> 895.48]  Please keep your...
[895.48 --> 896.48]  Hi Brandon!
[896.48 --> 898.48]  Keep your language to yourself.
[898.48 --> 900.48]  Because Brandon's the one we have to worry about.
[900.48 --> 901.48]  Yes, is it Brandon?
[901.48 --> 902.48]  The potty ball.
[902.48 --> 903.48]  Yeah, you have to worry about.
[903.48 --> 905.48]  I'm the worst one in the current.
[905.48 --> 911.48]  Brandon just spews slur words.
[911.48 --> 917.48]  Yeah, I'm gonna keep taking shots at you until I feel like I've gotten you back for poking me during my video.
[917.48 --> 920.48]  That was the best part of that video.
[920.48 --> 921.48]  That was actually pretty funny.
[921.48 --> 922.48]  I'm sure a lot of people were happy with that.
[922.48 --> 923.48]  Would you stop!
[923.48 --> 926.48]  Well, with the amount of Twitch comments we get.
[926.48 --> 930.48]  People are like, Linus, honestly, don't use a plain background like Unbox Therapy.
[930.48 --> 932.48]  I like an interesting background like the kitchen.
[932.48 --> 934.48]  We're not gonna do a white wall.
[934.48 --> 935.48]  We have plans for sets.
[935.48 --> 938.48]  Yeah, we're moving into a big space.
[938.48 --> 947.48]  We're not gonna move into a big space so that we can paint, you know, a 60 foot by 40 foot wall white.
[947.48 --> 949.48]  That is not the point.
[949.48 --> 950.48]  Well, maybe the base coat.
[950.48 --> 951.48]  Yeah.
[951.48 --> 953.48]  But then other things.
[953.48 --> 954.48]  Yeah!
[954.48 --> 955.48]  Rainbow Dragon Jack!
[955.48 --> 956.48]  Technicality!
[956.48 --> 957.48]  Yeah!
[957.48 --> 959.48]  How about you guys say Technicolor and I was like, that's what I'm saying.
[959.48 --> 960.48]  Oh yeah, we could do that.
[960.48 --> 961.48]  No.
[961.48 --> 966.48]  People are like, what about if the new WAN show set is in a kitchen?
[966.48 --> 967.48]  Oh my god!
[967.48 --> 968.48]  You know what?
[968.48 --> 969.48]  I'll tell you what.
[969.48 --> 974.48]  I won't promise a kitchen, but we could have like a faucet somewhere in the background.
[974.48 --> 979.48]  Somebody had a really good suggestion which was like, can you at least like hide a spatula
[979.48 --> 981.48]  somewhere in the new LTT set or something?
[981.48 --> 982.48]  Sure.
[982.48 --> 983.48]  We can call that.
[983.48 --> 985.48]  Or we could have like one of those really crappy plants.
[985.48 --> 986.48]  Are those even still there?
[986.48 --> 987.48]  Oh yeah.
[987.48 --> 988.48]  The fake ball plants that you got.
[988.48 --> 989.48]  Oh yeah, those are there.
[989.48 --> 990.48]  Those are hilarious.
[990.48 --> 991.48]  I got those from the dollar store, man.
[991.48 --> 992.48]  They helped so much, but they're so stupid.
[992.48 --> 993.48]  I know, but they-
[993.48 --> 994.48]  They help a lot.
[994.48 --> 995.48]  They help a lot.
[995.48 --> 996.48]  They help a lot.
[996.48 --> 997.48]  I agree.
[997.48 --> 1001.48]  It has like an alarm clock that's never set so it's always flashing.
[1001.48 --> 1002.48]  Yeah.
[1002.48 --> 1010.48]  And then sometimes we'll remember to put gaffa tape over it so that it doesn't show up.
[1010.48 --> 1012.48]  Oh man.
[1012.48 --> 1016.48]  Alex Madd asks, how much would the bronze statue of Gaben cost?
[1016.48 --> 1018.48]  You said you priced it out.
[1018.48 --> 1019.48]  Somewhere.
[1019.48 --> 1023.48]  It's somewhere in the range of $130,000 to $175,000.
[1023.48 --> 1026.48]  So it's not really a tier that we want to reach because-
[1026.48 --> 1028.48]  Yeah, I remember these are the other expenses.
[1028.48 --> 1029.48]  It's just-
[1029.48 --> 1031.48]  Yeah, no, no, I factored that in.
[1031.48 --> 1032.48]  I know.
[1032.48 --> 1033.48]  Well, I'm saying because Nick was like, uh.
[1033.48 --> 1035.48]  I thought Wipit factored in was like $120,000.
[1035.48 --> 1041.48]  To get an artisan to come and do it because I hadn't factored in the room and board and
[1041.48 --> 1043.48]  flight and all that stuff.
[1043.48 --> 1046.48]  So if we could find someone locally, we could probably save some money.
[1046.48 --> 1051.48]  But if we found some of the people that I found that have their work advertised online,
[1051.48 --> 1053.48]  it was going to be really expensive.
[1053.48 --> 1055.48]  Like, life size is not cheap.
[1055.48 --> 1056.48]  No.
[1056.48 --> 1059.48]  Someone says, please talk about Linus Cat Tips channel.
[1059.48 --> 1063.48]  I don't really have any plans to resurrect Linus Cat Tips anytime soon.
[1063.48 --> 1067.48]  The problem with Linus Cat Tips, as much as anything, is my cats.
[1067.48 --> 1071.48]  They're extremely difficult to capture doing anything interesting because they just kind
[1071.48 --> 1073.48]  of stop whenever I turn on a camera.
[1073.48 --> 1074.48]  It's true.
[1074.48 --> 1075.48]  I don't know how-
[1075.48 --> 1076.48]  That's the other thing with that.
[1076.48 --> 1077.48]  Yeah.
[1077.48 --> 1078.48]  I don't know how many cats in a cage.
[1078.48 --> 1079.48]  Rockin' in normal.
[1079.48 --> 1080.48]  That's outrageous.
[1080.48 --> 1084.48]  I can't log in with my Steam account anymore.
[1084.48 --> 1085.48]  What?
[1085.48 --> 1086.48]  Is that broken on the forum?
[1086.48 --> 1087.48]  It shouldn't be.
[1087.48 --> 1090.48]  I used it like two days ago.
[1090.48 --> 1091.48]  It could be though.
[1091.48 --> 1092.48]  Ooh.
[1092.48 --> 1093.48]  I wonder if that was-
[1093.48 --> 1096.48]  Silent Protagonist asks, if I donate a million dollars and go into severe debt, can I get
[1096.48 --> 1097.48]  a job?
[1097.48 --> 1098.48]  What?
[1098.48 --> 1099.48]  What?
[1099.48 --> 1102.48]  I'm not sure how to address that.
[1102.48 --> 1105.48]  John asks, how big do you want Linus Media Group to get?
[1105.48 --> 1106.48]  Maybe five years from now.
[1106.48 --> 1111.48]  The goal for Linus Media Group doesn't really have a limit.
[1111.48 --> 1119.48]  I mean, what I kind of realized when we destroyed my original five year goal was that, I don't
[1119.48 --> 1122.48]  know, the sky's kind of the limit and we're going to just do our best with it.
[1122.48 --> 1128.48]  We're going to just do more, faster, harder, better, as long as we can, as hard as we can,
[1128.48 --> 1129.48]  as fast as we can.
[1129.48 --> 1131.48]  So Steam login is broken.
[1131.48 --> 1132.48]  Oh.
[1132.48 --> 1133.48]  So I'll fix that.
[1133.48 --> 1134.48]  Okay.
[1134.48 --> 1135.48]  Sorry.
[1135.48 --> 1136.48]  Maybe check the other ones as well.
[1136.48 --> 1137.48]  I did.
[1137.48 --> 1138.48]  The other ones work.
[1138.48 --> 1139.48]  Okay.
[1139.48 --> 1140.48]  So we'll get that fixed for you guys.
[1140.48 --> 1141.48]  Yeah.
[1141.48 --> 1142.48]  Like, here.
[1142.48 --> 1145.48]  Here's an example of one of the things that I would love to do.
[1145.48 --> 1150.48]  You know, when we get a little bit more monthly cash flow, because a lot of the cash that we
[1150.48 --> 1154.48]  have now is going to go into moving into this place, even if we raise a bunch of money with
[1154.48 --> 1156.48]  the crowdfunding campaign.
[1156.48 --> 1161.48]  Like, something I would love to do is have a couple people that are dedicated to developing
[1161.48 --> 1165.48]  a new channel of, like, funny videos and, like, sketch comedy.
[1165.48 --> 1168.48]  I think we're a really funny group here.
[1168.48 --> 1173.48]  And something like the campaign video, that I, even people who didn't like the idea that
[1173.48 --> 1178.48]  we were doing a crowdfunding campaign said, wow, that was a great video.
[1178.48 --> 1181.48]  That was really professionally shot and it was hilarious.
[1181.48 --> 1183.48]  You know how long that took us?
[1183.48 --> 1188.48]  That takes a lot less time and effort than most of our review videos.
[1188.48 --> 1189.48]  Way less.
[1189.48 --> 1190.48]  Yep.
[1190.48 --> 1191.48]  I spent, um...
[1191.48 --> 1192.48]  Maybe like two hours.
[1192.48 --> 1195.48]  I spent an hour and a half scripting it.
[1195.48 --> 1201.48]  I spent about an hour in a meeting with Burkle about how we were going to shoot it, like,
[1201.48 --> 1204.48]  what was going to core... and then tweaking some of it to make it funnier.
[1204.48 --> 1208.48]  And then we spent about three hours shooting it and Burkle spent half a day editing it.
[1208.48 --> 1210.48]  And we have a lot of pretty creative people.
[1210.48 --> 1214.48]  So these concepts for, like, the ideas for those videos fly around all the time.
[1214.48 --> 1215.48]  And so...
[1215.48 --> 1217.48]  And we have lists of things that we would like to do that would be cool.
[1217.48 --> 1219.48]  Why do we want to grow?
[1219.48 --> 1221.48]  And why do we want you guys to help us grow?
[1221.48 --> 1222.48]  Because we don't...
[1222.48 --> 1224.48]  We're going to keep making tech videos.
[1224.48 --> 1225.48]  That's our bread and butter.
[1225.48 --> 1226.48]  That's our lifeblood.
[1226.48 --> 1228.48]  That's the thing that I'm, like, passionate about.
[1228.48 --> 1230.48]  Like, something arrives at the door and it's like,
[1230.48 --> 1232.48]  Ooh, ooh, what's in it?
[1232.48 --> 1233.48]  Like, that's...
[1233.48 --> 1234.48]  That's...
[1234.48 --> 1235.48]  We all love that stuff.
[1235.48 --> 1237.48]  But we want to be able to do more.
[1237.48 --> 1241.48]  And we think there's a lot of creative ideas we have that are not getting tapped.
[1241.48 --> 1247.48]  Because either we don't have enough support to make tech videos to the level that we think you guys deserve,
[1247.48 --> 1253.48]  without spending all of our time on them, or have enough resources to bring in additional new people
[1253.48 --> 1258.48]  to start to develop that new content that we think would be hilarious and awesome.
[1258.48 --> 1259.48]  So...
[1259.48 --> 1260.48]  So that's what we want to do.
[1260.48 --> 1261.48]  That's why we're doing this.
[1261.48 --> 1262.48]  And that's...
[1262.48 --> 1264.48]  That's what I want Linus Media Group to be five years from now.
[1264.48 --> 1267.48]  I want it to have, you know, like, uh...
[1267.48 --> 1268.48]  Okay, I don't want to...
[1268.48 --> 1274.48]  I want to say ideas that are good without revealing the ideas that we're actually going to do right now.
[1274.48 --> 1275.48]  Yeah, I know what you're doing.
[1275.48 --> 1276.48]  I don't want to hear you.
[1276.48 --> 1277.48]  Um...
[1277.48 --> 1278.48]  So, let's just leave it at that.
[1278.48 --> 1280.48]  But, yeah, we have a lot of really great ideas for things we want to do.
[1280.48 --> 1282.48]  And some of them won't even involve me.
[1282.48 --> 1284.48]  I won't even be on camera.
[1284.48 --> 1286.48]  But that doesn't mean that...
[1286.48 --> 1289.48]  Creative processes, administration, all that kind of stuff.
[1289.48 --> 1294.48]  Yeah, and that we can't use this backbone that we've created of Linus Tech Tips and Tech Quickie,
[1294.48 --> 1300.48]  and to a much lesser extent, Channel Super Fun, to fund more awesome content.
[1300.48 --> 1301.48]  So it's...
[1301.48 --> 1304.48]  For me, it's not, we need you guys to give us this money.
[1304.48 --> 1309.48]  It's, if you want to support this campaign, then that's great.
[1309.48 --> 1310.48]  It'll help us get there faster.
[1310.48 --> 1319.48]  If you think that the team we have is capable of giving you guys a good return on that $10 or $25 or however much investment,
[1319.48 --> 1322.48]  in terms of the entertainment and the knowledge that you'll get from it, then great.
[1322.48 --> 1325.48]  And if you don't feel like that, then that's fine too.
[1325.48 --> 1326.48]  It's okay.
[1326.48 --> 1328.48]  I don't want there to be any pressure.
[1328.48 --> 1343.48]  I think that's what was upsetting people, is they felt like there was this pressure, like I was pitching that we wouldn't be able to do it if they didn't, you know, throw $600,000 at us to build a gay band statue in the lobby of our new office.
[1343.48 --> 1344.48]  It was, yeah.
[1344.48 --> 1345.48]  That was a joke anyway.
[1345.48 --> 1348.48]  A lot of the tiers were obviously jokes, but it was not.
[1348.48 --> 1352.48]  A lot of the ones I really didn't want to do we've brought down into the attainable realm, so.
[1352.48 --> 1355.48]  Let's be clear, it's not a joke in the sense that we weren't going to do it.
[1355.48 --> 1356.48]  We would do it, but like...
[1356.48 --> 1360.48]  It was a joke in the sense that it would not be, like, beneficial at all to us.
[1360.48 --> 1365.48]  Yeah, and it wasn't something that we expected at all.
[1365.48 --> 1366.48]  No, not even close.
[1366.48 --> 1375.48]  We looked into it, well, Linus looked into it a really long time ago, just as like a, how feasible is this not even to be part of this campaign, just because we thought it would be kind of cool to do.
[1375.48 --> 1378.48]  It's like, oh, it's buckets of money.
[1378.48 --> 1379.48]  Okay.
[1379.48 --> 1380.48]  What's up?
[1380.48 --> 1385.48]  People have reminded me in Twitch chat that I didn't post the wrap.
[1385.48 --> 1386.48]  Starkeeper wrap?
[1386.48 --> 1389.48]  Uh, how do I, how do I post it on the forum, do you know?
[1389.48 --> 1392.48]  Uh, what do you mean?
[1392.48 --> 1395.48]  Don't know about swag, but me I'm...
[1395.48 --> 1396.48]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one.
[1396.48 --> 1397.48]  Nope, not that.
[1397.48 --> 1398.48]  Oh, it's so awful.
[1398.48 --> 1399.48]  Don't need that.
[1399.48 --> 1403.48]  Oh, come on, man, you had a black and white suit from your head to your feet though.
[1403.48 --> 1404.48]  Not set up right now.
[1404.48 --> 1405.48]  Where can I put it?
[1405.48 --> 1407.48]  Uh, if you want to use that...
[1407.48 --> 1409.48]  Oh no, because we just moved.
[1409.48 --> 1410.48]  Yeah, that's terrible.
[1410.48 --> 1411.48]  Um...
[1411.48 --> 1413.48]  Where else could we put it?
[1413.48 --> 1414.48]  Could we torrent it?
[1414.48 --> 1415.48]  Yeah.
[1415.48 --> 1421.48]  You could torrent it, you could Dropbox download, you could mega upload.
[1421.48 --> 1422.48]  Mega upload!
[1422.48 --> 1423.48]  Try mega upload.
[1423.48 --> 1425.48]  Mega upload, here we go.
[1425.48 --> 1426.48]  Mega adopt.
[1426.48 --> 1429.48]  This is so bad, I really don't think people should want to...
[1429.48 --> 1430.48]  Just mega.
[1430.48 --> 1431.48]  Just mega.
[1431.48 --> 1432.48]  You're mega.
[1432.48 --> 1433.48]  Mega.
[1433.48 --> 1434.48]  Mega.
[1434.48 --> 1440.48]  Okay, do I have to log in to upload things?
[1440.48 --> 1441.48]  Nope.
[1441.48 --> 1442.48]  Cool.
[1442.48 --> 1443.48]  Mega's awesome.
[1443.48 --> 1444.48]  I think it's awesome.
[1444.48 --> 1445.48]  Oh.
[1445.48 --> 1446.48]  Alright.
[1446.48 --> 1453.48]  I'm glad I was able to at least find the file now that I've committed to show it to people,
[1453.48 --> 1454.48]  because I wasn't sure where it was.
[1454.48 --> 1456.48]  It's in Ed's stupid...
[1456.48 --> 1457.48]  Oh no.
[1457.48 --> 1458.48]  Disorganized.
[1458.48 --> 1459.48]  ...wrinkling brains folder.
[1459.48 --> 1460.48]  Pit of death.
[1460.48 --> 1462.48]  Yeah, there's just... who knows what's there.
[1462.48 --> 1464.48]  The files go to get lost.
[1464.48 --> 1465.48]  Okay.
[1465.48 --> 1466.48]  Okay.
[1466.48 --> 1470.48]  So, we're using an ephemeral account, it will expire, etc.
[1470.48 --> 1473.48]  That's okay, we'll put it on a torrent before then.
[1473.48 --> 1474.48]  Yeah.
[1474.48 --> 1475.48]  So it's all good.
[1475.48 --> 1479.48]  Alright, that's gonna be up in a moment.
[1479.48 --> 1481.48]  Let me check out...
[1481.48 --> 1484.48]  Ooh, Travis... er...
[1484.48 --> 1489.48]  Is a person who Luke goes...
[1489.48 --> 1490.48]  Travis...
[1490.48 --> 1492.48]  Who is unrelated to anything else that...
[1492.48 --> 1493.48]  Travis wanted you to go to dinner.
[1493.48 --> 1495.48]  ...that would be going on, yes.
[1495.48 --> 1496.48]  I give up.
[1496.48 --> 1498.48]  Anyways, plans and things.
[1498.48 --> 1499.48]  Plans and things.
[1499.48 --> 1500.48]  Talk later.
[1500.48 --> 1501.48]  Ha.
[1501.48 --> 1502.48]  Ha.
[1502.48 --> 1503.48]  Ha.
[1503.48 --> 1507.48]  Um, Balthazar asks, will the move cause a video shortage?
[1507.48 --> 1510.48]  I would like to say no, but no guarantees.
[1510.48 --> 1512.48]  It's gonna be pretty intense.
[1512.48 --> 1513.48]  I'll do it well.
[1513.48 --> 1515.48]  Last time, we didn't have... we didn't miss a day.
[1515.48 --> 1516.48]  Nope.
[1516.48 --> 1518.48]  We moved the entire company and we didn't miss a day.
[1518.48 --> 1519.48]  It was also a lot easier.
[1519.48 --> 1521.48]  It was a lot easier then.
[1521.48 --> 1522.48]  There.
[1522.48 --> 1523.48]  Our videos were easier.
[1523.48 --> 1527.48]  What we might do is we might just bail and do like unboxing week or something.
[1527.48 --> 1528.48]  Yeah.
[1528.48 --> 1532.48]  Where I could literally film seven unboxings in a single day, like in a single sitting,
[1532.48 --> 1536.48]  and then we would throw that together and we could do like a retro kickback unboxing
[1536.48 --> 1537.48]  week thing to cover the move.
[1537.48 --> 1538.48]  That could be...
[1538.48 --> 1539.48]  Oh my god.
[1539.48 --> 1542.48]  That could tie in so well if people hit the like fountain tier thing.
[1542.48 --> 1543.48]  Just do all of them.
[1543.48 --> 1544.48]  Oh yeah.
[1544.48 --> 1548.48]  We could do all of them at the old fountain in front of the old NCIX office.
[1548.48 --> 1550.48]  How far is that now?
[1550.48 --> 1551.48]  Cause I don't like...
[1551.48 --> 1552.48]  I don't think it's that far.
[1552.48 --> 1553.48]  I don't know where anything is.
[1553.48 --> 1555.48]  We moved so many tiers.
[1555.48 --> 1556.48]  Yeah.
[1556.48 --> 1558.48]  Everything is just completely jumbled and I have no idea.
[1558.48 --> 1559.48]  Okay.
[1559.48 --> 1560.48]  Uh...
[1560.48 --> 1563.48]  Austin asks, could one of the stretch goals to be to hire Barnacles?
[1563.48 --> 1565.48]  I'm gonna be honest with you guys.
[1565.48 --> 1566.48]  It's not like I haven't tried.
[1566.48 --> 1567.48]  Yeah.
[1567.48 --> 1568.48]  If Barnacles wanted to be hired.
[1568.48 --> 1569.48]  Yeah.
[1569.48 --> 1572.48]  Then it would probably not be an issue.
[1572.48 --> 1573.48]  Um...
[1573.48 --> 1576.48]  So, uh, 27 and a half.
[1576.48 --> 1577.48]  27 and a half thousand?
[1577.48 --> 1578.48]  Old school unboxing.
[1578.48 --> 1579.48]  Old school unboxing.
[1579.48 --> 1580.48]  Back in the NCIX courtyard.
[1580.48 --> 1581.48]  Nice.
[1581.48 --> 1585.48]  So if they hit 27 and a half then we can release like that week, be like old school.
[1585.48 --> 1588.48]  James asks, if you don't reach the targets will you still be moving?
[1588.48 --> 1589.48]  Yes.
[1589.48 --> 1590.48]  We will still move.
[1590.48 --> 1591.48]  We have to.
[1591.48 --> 1592.48]  There's...
[1592.48 --> 1593.48]  We don't have a choice.
[1593.48 --> 1597.48]  This place is too small and we have big aspirations.
[1597.48 --> 1599.48]  It might take us a little bit longer, but...
[1599.48 --> 1600.48]  Um...
[1600.48 --> 1601.48]  And like...
[1601.48 --> 1603.48]  So again, it comes down to what's the motivation here?
[1603.48 --> 1607.48]  We're reaching out to the community to help us kickstart this for...
[1607.48 --> 1609.48]  You know, TM or whatever.
[1609.48 --> 1610.48]  Yeah.
[1610.48 --> 1611.48]  To jumpstart it.
[1611.48 --> 1612.48]  Jumpstarter.
[1612.48 --> 1613.48]  Jumpstarter.
[1613.48 --> 1614.48]  Um...
[1614.48 --> 1618.48]  Where is the whole room water cooling video?
[1618.48 --> 1619.48]  That...
[1619.48 --> 1622.48]  That series of videos will come before we move.
[1622.48 --> 1623.48]  But that's all I can really say.
[1623.48 --> 1625.48]  Is he working on them now?
[1625.48 --> 1626.48]  Um...
[1626.48 --> 1629.48]  Well, he was out a day this week with a problem with his wrist.
[1629.48 --> 1634.48]  He's been working on NCIX videos a lot this week because we were a week behind on them.
[1634.48 --> 1635.48]  Um...
[1635.48 --> 1638.48]  I told him next week he should hand off a lot of the NCIX stuff to Taren.
[1638.48 --> 1640.48]  And then, um...
[1640.48 --> 1643.48]  He should be spending all of his time on water cooling.
[1643.48 --> 1644.48]  Okay, cool.
[1644.48 --> 1645.48]  Yeah.
[1645.48 --> 1646.48]  I want those rolling soon.
[1646.48 --> 1649.48]  Yeah, because I was gonna say, people would probably appreciate that sort of an update.
[1649.48 --> 1652.48]  I don't want to commit a date at this time because...
[1652.48 --> 1654.48]  When are we gonna do mineral oil?
[1654.48 --> 1655.48]  Soon.
[1655.48 --> 1656.48]  I want to get that going soon.
[1656.48 --> 1657.48]  We haven't poured yet.
[1657.48 --> 1658.48]  I know.
[1658.48 --> 1659.48]  I know.
[1659.48 --> 1660.48]  I know.
[1660.48 --> 1661.48]  I know.
[1661.48 --> 1662.48]  We'll do it.
[1662.48 --> 1663.48]  We'll do it.
[1663.48 --> 1665.48]  I don't know.
[1665.48 --> 1667.48]  The thing that frustrates me most is...
[1667.48 --> 1668.48]  Yeah, I get it.
[1668.48 --> 1669.48]  You don't want to fund us or whatever.
[1669.48 --> 1670.48]  That's fine.
[1670.48 --> 1672.48]  But the people who are like, oh, what they do is so easy.
[1672.48 --> 1673.48]  It doesn't take any time at all.
[1673.48 --> 1674.48]  They just make a video.
[1674.48 --> 1675.48]  It's like...
[1675.48 --> 1680.48]  I worked probably like 80 or 90 hours this week.
[1680.48 --> 1682.48]  You did probably more than that.
[1682.48 --> 1688.48]  When I tweeted that the form was down for maintenance, people were like, what maintenance does a website need?
[1688.48 --> 1689.48]  What?
[1689.48 --> 1697.48]  Just because you don't understand how something works doesn't mean it's not a lot of work.
[1697.48 --> 1703.48]  And then we've got people saying, oh, well, other YouTubers do it on their own, like Marques and Austin.
[1703.48 --> 1707.48]  It's like, yeah, how many videos a week do they release?
[1707.48 --> 1708.48]  Not nine!
[1708.48 --> 1711.48]  We release a lot.
[1711.48 --> 1712.48]  It's kind of insane.
[1712.48 --> 1716.48]  Every single time that we actually say that number, I'm like, whoa, wait, really?
[1716.48 --> 1717.48]  Yeah.
[1717.48 --> 1718.48]  That's insanity.
[1718.48 --> 1721.48]  We release a tech quickies and seven Linus Tech Tips, including Len Show, every week.
[1721.48 --> 1726.48]  And that doesn't count the NCIX Tech Tips episodes that I film and Ed edits.
[1726.48 --> 1727.48]  So that's another four per week.
[1727.48 --> 1728.48]  Yeah.
[1728.48 --> 1729.48]  We make a lot of content.
[1729.48 --> 1734.48]  And when we were rolling Channel Super Fun, it was 10 every week when we were doing a weekly video.
[1734.48 --> 1739.48]  And I expect to roll Channel Super Fun again starting next week.
[1739.48 --> 1740.48]  So look forward to that.
[1740.48 --> 1744.48]  We've got a lot of stuff that's just been backlogged.
[1744.48 --> 1745.48]  It's really cool stuff.
[1745.48 --> 1747.48]  We're bailing on that thing, right?
[1747.48 --> 1748.48]  Which one?
[1748.48 --> 1749.48]  Yeah.
[1749.48 --> 1750.48]  Yeah, we bailed on that one.
[1750.48 --> 1757.48]  The, the, you want me?
[1757.48 --> 1759.48]  Wow, there's 175 new tweets.
[1759.48 --> 1762.48]  Now that everyone figured out I'm only looking at tweets.
[1762.48 --> 1767.48]  How are the coding streams on YouTube?
[1767.48 --> 1768.48]  What?
[1768.48 --> 1770.48]  Yeah, they're over at youtube.com slash modus.
[1770.48 --> 1771.48]  Yeah.
[1771.48 --> 1774.48]  Those, those, we just hosted those for modus.
[1774.48 --> 1779.48]  Um, so those were, those were their content that we just kind of, I was a host that hopefully
[1779.48 --> 1783.48]  is not ugly and, you know, awful to listen to.
[1783.48 --> 1785.48]  Did you host a coding like programming stream?
[1785.48 --> 1786.48]  Yeah.
[1786.48 --> 1787.48]  Yeah.
[1787.48 --> 1788.48]  Talk to an expert kind of thing.
[1788.48 --> 1789.48]  No, it wasn't the expert.
[1789.48 --> 1790.48]  Okay.
[1790.48 --> 1791.48]  Yeah.
[1791.48 --> 1792.48]  I was like, what?
[1792.48 --> 1793.48]  Yeah.
[1793.48 --> 1798.48]  I used my, I used my just enough knowledge to be dangerous to ask the expert the right
[1798.48 --> 1800.48]  questions so they could talk about information that was useful.
[1800.48 --> 1801.48]  There you go.
[1801.48 --> 1802.48]  Okay, that's cool.
[1802.48 --> 1803.48]  I thought, I thought those streams were really good first.
[1803.48 --> 1804.48]  I thought so too.
[1804.48 --> 1805.48]  I thought especially the second two were really good.
[1805.48 --> 1807.48]  Yeah, especially the second one on the third one.
[1807.48 --> 1809.48]  Um, I like that book giveaway.
[1809.48 --> 1812.48]  So CJ asks, I've even had people message me about.
[1812.48 --> 1814.48]  Whole room cooling in a new space.
[1814.48 --> 1816.48]  I know the videos are coming, but will you move the setup?
[1816.48 --> 1818.48]  I would like to move the setup.
[1818.48 --> 1819.48]  Yes.
[1819.48 --> 1823.48]  It'll require some modification to move it in there, but I would like to set it up in
[1823.48 --> 1824.48]  the editing room at the new place.
[1824.48 --> 1827.48]  Um, but the videos will be about how we have it set up here.
[1827.48 --> 1832.48]  Now that the theory's done and a lot of the grunt work is done, it shouldn't be that insane
[1832.48 --> 1833.48]  to move it.
[1833.48 --> 1834.48]  It's still not going to be easy.
[1834.48 --> 1835.48]  Yeah.
[1835.48 --> 1838.48]  Do we have a power source in that game?
[1838.48 --> 1839.48]  What?
[1839.48 --> 1840.48]  A power source?
[1840.48 --> 1841.48]  On the fan?
[1841.48 --> 1842.48]  No.
[1842.48 --> 1843.48]  Not right now.
[1843.48 --> 1844.48]  They're still not working.
[1844.48 --> 1845.48]  It's wintertime.
[1845.48 --> 1846.48]  I know, but like, it's just funny.
[1846.48 --> 1847.48]  Yeah.
[1847.48 --> 1851.48]  The funny story about the whole room water cooling system is, uh, the fans on the outside
[1851.48 --> 1852.48]  radiator, they all failed.
[1852.48 --> 1853.48]  Not the fans.
[1853.48 --> 1854.48]  The fans are good.
[1854.48 --> 1855.48]  The power supply failed.
[1855.48 --> 1859.48]  So none of them are spinning, but all the systems are working fine.
[1859.48 --> 1861.48]  It was just like a laptop.
[1861.48 --> 1866.48]  Um, Dimitru asks, what will happen to the current location?
[1866.48 --> 1867.48]  That's still up in the air.
[1867.48 --> 1868.48]  We're not sure.
[1868.48 --> 1873.48]  Um, Josh asks, how often will you upload new content to the channel after you've settled
[1873.48 --> 1874.48]  in your new place?
[1874.48 --> 1878.48]  Uh, Linus Tech Tips isn't going to get more than a daily upload.
[1878.48 --> 1880.48]  I doubt that'll ever happen.
[1880.48 --> 1882.48]  Uh, although don't quote me on it.
[1882.48 --> 1884.48]  Um, but newer channels.
[1884.48 --> 1888.48]  So things like TechQuickie, I expect to want to pump more content there.
[1888.48 --> 1893.48]  I want Channel Super Fun to have a full lineup of content, not just one random weekly video.
[1893.48 --> 1897.48]  So we have a lot of, a lot of plans beyond Linus Tech Tips.
[1897.48 --> 1899.48]  I'm really stoked for some of the Channel Super Fun plans.
[1899.48 --> 1900.48]  Yeah, buddy.
[1900.48 --> 1904.48]  Ryan asks, how much money do you actually need and when are you planning to move?
[1904.48 --> 1906.48]  Really there is no fixed amount.
[1906.48 --> 1909.48]  Um, however much, which is again, why we're doing the crowdfunding thing.
[1909.48 --> 1920.48]  The crowdfunding thing is like a cherry on top to give, you know, Brandon a nice budget to get some nice sets done and some lights going on.
[1920.48 --> 1931.48]  It's, it's to, it's to, you know, get stuff like a proper organization system for Luke to be able to keep hardware in places that are not just video cards scattered all over the place.
[1931.48 --> 1939.48]  Cause right now the way that he stores things drives me bananas and I'd love to yell at him about it, but there's realistically nowhere that he can put anything anywhere.
[1939.48 --> 1947.48]  So it's, it's a matter of how soon we'll be able to make things, how soon we'll be able to make things livable there.
[1947.48 --> 1950.48]  So the more there is, the more that will help.
[1951.48 --> 1953.48]  Carson asks, when are we expected to move?
[1953.48 --> 1955.48]  Um, I guess I'll give you guys a little bit more detail.
[1955.48 --> 1960.48]  So for those of you who are saying, Oh, why don't you guys take out a bank loan?
[1960.48 --> 1962.48]  Uh, yeah, we're taking out a loan.
[1962.48 --> 1973.48]  Uh, but, um, the bank that we're going through the bank that we, that we bank with requires small businesses to have been around for two years before they'll give you any kind of significant loans.
[1973.48 --> 1974.48]  Probably not a bad idea.
[1974.48 --> 1976.48]  Which is probably not terrible for them.
[1976.48 --> 1978.48]  Um, cause another financial crash.
[1978.48 --> 1979.48]  So we're not two years old yet.
[1979.48 --> 1984.48]  So we are not going to be able to move until we cross that threshold early next year.
[1984.48 --> 1989.48]  Um, when will the campaign end?
[1989.48 --> 1990.48]  End of the year.
[1990.48 --> 1999.48]  How will you be moving the water cooling to the new space by unscrewing it from the wall and carrying it out in pieces and then reassembling it and recutting it on the other side.
[1999.48 --> 2002.48]  And hopefully shit run, Jen.
[2002.48 --> 2004.48]  Can you say my name?
[2004.48 --> 2007.48]  When you say my name, I know it's difficult and that's why you never mentioned me.
[2007.48 --> 2008.48]  Lol.
[2008.48 --> 2009.48]  Did you not say his name?
[2009.48 --> 2010.48]  Or did you say his name?
[2010.48 --> 2011.48]  Uh, I tried.
[2011.48 --> 2012.48]  Okay, yeah.
[2012.48 --> 2013.48]  Yeah.
[2013.48 --> 2015.48]  I thought you just said the text and then moved on.
[2015.48 --> 2016.48]  I was like, perfect!
[2016.48 --> 2018.48]  Duncan wants me to rap live?
[2018.48 --> 2019.48]  So not happening.
[2019.48 --> 2020.48]  I'll beatbox for you.
[2020.48 --> 2021.48]  You ready?
[2021.48 --> 2022.48]  Not happening.
[2022.48 --> 2023.48]  No.
[2023.48 --> 2024.48]  No.
[2024.48 --> 2025.48]  No.
[2025.48 --> 2026.48]  No.
[2026.48 --> 2027.48]  No.
[2027.48 --> 2028.48]  No.
[2028.48 --> 2029.48]  No.
[2029.48 --> 2030.48]  No.
[2030.48 --> 2031.48]  No.
[2031.48 --> 2036.48]  Yo, my name is Linus and I like the tech.
[2036.48 --> 2037.48]  I'm really cool.
[2037.48 --> 2038.48]  Yeah, get rekt, kid.
[2038.48 --> 2040.48]  Off screen and rap, go on.
[2040.48 --> 2041.48]  Yeah.
[2041.48 --> 2042.48]  Done.
[2042.48 --> 2043.48]  There you go.
[2043.48 --> 2044.48]  Wow.
[2044.48 --> 2045.48]  I hate you all.
[2045.48 --> 2048.48]  Nick should live rap a video.
[2048.48 --> 2049.48]  That'd be cool, but...
[2049.48 --> 2050.48]  You are musical, though.
[2050.48 --> 2051.48]  I'm musical, but I don't...
[2051.48 --> 2052.48]  He's not a rapper.
[2052.48 --> 2053.48]  I'm not good at, like, freestyling or anything.
[2053.48 --> 2054.48]  I'm very, very white.
[2054.48 --> 2055.48]  What?!
[2055.48 --> 2056.48]  You know what, for a second, I don't know why this is not a great time.
[2056.48 --> 2057.48]  You reminded me of Where's Waldo had a voice that night.
[2057.48 --> 2058.48]  Yes, hello, I'm Waldo.
[2058.48 --> 2059.48]  Oh my god.
[2059.48 --> 2060.48]  Did you know that it's Where's Wally, like, everywhere else in the world?
[2060.48 --> 2061.48]  Yeah.
[2061.48 --> 2062.48]  I don't know why I'm not a rapper.
[2062.48 --> 2063.48]  I don't know why this is not a great time.
[2063.48 --> 2064.48]  I don't know why this is not a great time.
[2064.48 --> 2065.48]  I don't know why this is not a great time.
[2065.48 --> 2066.48]  You reminded me of Where's Waldo had a voice that night.
[2066.48 --> 2067.48]  Yes, hello, I'm Waldo.
[2067.48 --> 2068.48]  Did you know that it's Where's Wally, like, everywhere else in the world?
[2068.48 --> 2069.48]  Seriously?
[2069.48 --> 2070.48]  Yeah.
[2070.48 --> 2071.48]  His name's...
[2071.48 --> 2072.48]  It was the North American adaptation.
[2072.48 --> 2073.48]  What?!
[2073.48 --> 2074.48]  Yeah.
[2074.48 --> 2075.48]  I had no idea.
[2075.48 --> 2076.48]  Wally is a bad reminder here.
[2076.48 --> 2077.48]  Bad face.
[2077.48 --> 2078.48]  Wally...
[2078.48 --> 2079.48]  Yeah.
[2079.48 --> 2080.48]  Yeah.
[2080.48 --> 2081.48]  Yeah.
[2081.48 --> 2082.48]  Yeah.
[2082.48 --> 2083.48]  Yeah.
[2083.48 --> 2084.48]  Yeah.
[2084.48 --> 2085.48]  Yeah.
[2085.48 --> 2086.48]  Yeah.
[2086.48 --> 2087.48]  Yeah.
[2087.48 --> 2088.48]  Yeah.
[2088.48 --> 2089.48]  Yeah.
[2089.48 --> 2090.48]  Yeah.
[2090.48 --> 2091.48]  Yeah.
[2091.48 --> 2092.48]  Yeah.
[2092.48 --> 2093.48]  Yeah.
[2093.48 --> 2094.48]  Yeah.
[2094.48 --> 2095.48]  Yeah.
[2095.48 --> 2096.48]  Yeah.
[2096.48 --> 2097.48]  Don't know that.
[2097.48 --> 2098.48]  Alright.
[2098.48 --> 2099.48]  Here we go, Twitch chat.
[2099.48 --> 2102.48]  Here is...
[2102.48 --> 2106.48]  The mega link to the unaltered...
[2106.48 --> 2108.48]  I think this is the unaltered one.
[2108.48 --> 2110.48]  I should probably double check.
[2117.48 --> 2120.48]  I don't even want to hear it.
[2120.48 --> 2121.48]  It's horrible.
[2121.48 --> 2122.48]  I hate it.
[2122.48 --> 2123.48]  It's not as awesome.
[2123.48 --> 2127.48]  It's not playing for me for some reason.
[2127.48 --> 2129.48]  It's kind of weird.
[2129.48 --> 2132.48]  Someone says broken link is broken.
[2132.48 --> 2133.48]  Not yours.
[2133.48 --> 2135.48]  I don't think it was yours.
[2135.48 --> 2136.48]  I think it was, uh...
[2136.48 --> 2137.48]  Ghosts.
[2137.48 --> 2138.48]  Oh.
[2138.48 --> 2139.48]  Wait, what?
[2139.48 --> 2141.48]  No, people are saying it's not working.
[2141.48 --> 2143.48]  Yeah, I think it was the bot's link.
[2143.48 --> 2144.48]  Oh.
[2144.48 --> 2145.48]  Oh, the bot's link broke?
[2145.48 --> 2146.48]  I think so.
[2146.48 --> 2148.48]  It should come with the decryption key.
[2150.48 --> 2151.48]  Oh, here we go.
[2153.48 --> 2154.48]  Oh no, that's the, uh...
[2154.48 --> 2155.48]  Shoot, that's the Stormtrooper version.
[2155.48 --> 2156.48]  Oh, I have the wrong file anyway.
[2156.48 --> 2159.48]  Well, I'll go find the right file, I guess.
[2160.48 --> 2161.48]  Where is it?
[2161.48 --> 2163.48]  Oh, Streets by 50, Rap V2.
[2163.48 --> 2164.48]  That's probably it.
[2164.48 --> 2167.48]  Sorry guys, I got the wrong one.
[2167.48 --> 2172.48]  Why you wave file?
[2172.48 --> 2178.48]  Yeah, okay, so I don't think it's either of your links.
[2178.48 --> 2181.48]  When you just post it into Twitch, it kind of breaks.
[2181.48 --> 2182.48]  Really?
[2182.48 --> 2183.48]  Yeah.
[2183.48 --> 2184.48]  Oh.
[2184.48 --> 2186.48]  After the hashtag, it looks like it breaks.
[2186.48 --> 2191.48]  Okay, well, why don't I post it in the, um, the forum campaign thread?
[2191.48 --> 2192.48]  There you go.
[2192.48 --> 2193.48]  Oh.
[2193.48 --> 2194.48]  Okay.
[2194.48 --> 2195.48]  Okay.
[2195.48 --> 2199.48]  Better just not to?
[2199.48 --> 2200.48]  I'd rather not.
[2200.48 --> 2201.48]  Okay.
[2201.48 --> 2203.48]  Um, we can say we moved.
[2203.48 --> 2204.48]  Okay.
[2204.48 --> 2208.48]  Yeah, so we moved to a different, um, forum host.
[2208.48 --> 2210.48]  It seems a lot better.
[2210.48 --> 2213.48]  It seems like wicked way faster.
[2213.48 --> 2215.48]  I like the speed a lot.
[2215.48 --> 2216.48]  Um...
[2216.48 --> 2218.48]  I love the speed.
[2218.48 --> 2223.48]  It is much more expensive on top of the whole powered by Samsung SSDs thing.
[2223.48 --> 2224.48]  Yeah.
[2224.48 --> 2226.48]  Like, a lot more expensive.
[2226.48 --> 2231.48]  But, um, I think our forum users, especially the ones that are monthly contributors, just
[2231.48 --> 2232.48]  deserve it at this point.
[2232.48 --> 2236.48]  We've got a lot of monthly contributors, so we're kind of looking at it going well.
[2236.48 --> 2242.48]  Downtime sucks for everyone, especially people who are literally paying to be members of the community.
[2242.48 --> 2245.48]  And we had weird problems at our old posts.
[2245.48 --> 2246.48]  You don't have to be.
[2246.48 --> 2248.48]  Like, uh, one of the...
[2248.48 --> 2249.48]  Oh, weird.
[2249.48 --> 2250.48]  Yes.
[2250.48 --> 2251.48]  What the heck?
[2251.48 --> 2252.48]  Oh no, I'm editing your post.
[2252.48 --> 2253.48]  Oh.
[2253.48 --> 2254.48]  One of the big...
[2254.48 --> 2257.48]  One really big problem that we've had in the past is they were doing an upgrade on someone
[2257.48 --> 2261.48]  else's server on our rack and they, like, screwed up the entire rack.
[2261.48 --> 2264.48]  So our whole server rack was just down for like a day.
[2264.48 --> 2266.48]  And we're like, what are you guys even doing?
[2266.48 --> 2267.48]  This is ridiculous.
[2267.48 --> 2268.48]  Yeah, they were kind of buttheads.
[2268.48 --> 2270.48]  And they, they like, weren't helpful about it.
[2270.48 --> 2275.48]  Didn't tell us what was going on, so our server was just disconnected for a really long time
[2275.48 --> 2278.48]  without any communication from them at all.
[2278.48 --> 2279.48]  Um...
[2279.48 --> 2282.48]  So the thing we liked about that host was they were really cheap.
[2282.48 --> 2283.48]  Oh yeah.
[2283.48 --> 2288.48]  Um, and the service when it worked was super adequate for hosting a forum.
[2288.48 --> 2289.48]  It was fine.
[2289.48 --> 2292.48]  It's just the when it worked part is...
[2292.48 --> 2294.48]  Yeah, it was very frustrating.
[2294.48 --> 2299.48]  Um, and we still intend to hold onto that server and then, uh, we'll find some kind of
[2299.48 --> 2301.48]  other use for it, I think, in the future.
[2301.48 --> 2308.48]  Alright, so this is the, the 12 campaign reward link.
[2308.48 --> 2309.48]  Apparently forms down.
[2309.48 --> 2310.48]  Apparently what?
[2310.48 --> 2311.48]  Is it?
[2311.48 --> 2312.48]  Forms down.
[2312.48 --> 2313.48]  Hashtag rex.
[2313.48 --> 2315.48]  Hashtag you rex, yeah.
[2315.48 --> 2319.48]  Hashtag second day down.
[2331.48 --> 2336.48]  That's weird, I'm on it right now.
[2336.48 --> 2339.48]  Then again, I, hold on, I haven't loaded a page in a sec.
[2339.48 --> 2340.48]  Yeah, I was just gonna say.
[2340.48 --> 2343.48]  Apparently Jack Sack made another fanart thing.
[2343.48 --> 2344.48]  Oh yeah?
[2344.48 --> 2346.48]  I love his fanart stuff, it's awesome.
[2346.48 --> 2348.48]  Yeah, it's awesome to like it.
[2348.48 --> 2349.48]  Whoa.
[2349.48 --> 2350.48]  Sequel error.
[2350.48 --> 2351.48]  Okay.
[2351.48 --> 2358.48]  Mine ended up loading, just took forever.
[2358.48 --> 2362.48]  Alright, well there you go.
[2362.48 --> 2365.48]  Yeah, I gotta see glare on mine, so.
[2365.48 --> 2368.48]  That often doesn't mean much.
[2368.48 --> 2369.48]  Okay.
[2369.48 --> 2372.48]  Do you wanna look at it at all?
[2372.48 --> 2373.48]  No, no.
[2373.48 --> 2376.48]  Does that just mean we're getting hit too hard?
[2376.48 --> 2377.48]  Or, like, something.
[2377.48 --> 2378.48]  Those, it's, like, yeah.
[2378.48 --> 2379.48]  Don't worry about that one.
[2379.48 --> 2381.48]  Okay, but the page doesn't load.
[2381.48 --> 2382.48]  I know.
[2382.48 --> 2383.48]  Okay.
[2383.48 --> 2384.48]  So it'll come back when it-
[2384.48 --> 2385.48]  I'm working on it.
[2385.48 --> 2386.48]  Oh, I see.
[2386.48 --> 2390.48]  Jack Sack, I wish I could view your link, but it's down for me.
[2390.48 --> 2391.48]  I'm sorry.
[2391.48 --> 2398.48]  It's like you guys don't want me to have a way to send you this, this campaign milestone
[2398.48 --> 2399.48]  thing.
[2399.48 --> 2406.48]  Maybe I should just, maybe I should just accept that I can't, uh, release the Linus Stormtrooper
[2406.48 --> 2407.48]  rap.
[2407.48 --> 2408.48]  Can't, can't back out now, bro.
[2408.48 --> 2409.48]  Without the Stormtrooper voice.
[2409.48 --> 2411.48]  Can't back out, can't back out now, bro.
[2411.48 --> 2413.48]  My upload is going really slow.
[2413.48 --> 2415.48]  40 kilobytes per second.
[2415.48 --> 2417.48]  So it's gonna need another three minutes.
[2417.48 --> 2420.48]  Maybe I'll do some more, uh, some more tweets in the meantime here.
[2420.48 --> 2425.48]  Stretch goal idea number 42, Linus and Slick make a rap album.
[2425.48 --> 2427.48]  Oh my god.
[2427.48 --> 2428.48]  No.
[2428.48 --> 2429.48]  Dude.
[2429.48 --> 2433.48]  We could make the best rap videos.
[2433.48 --> 2436.48]  Define best.
[2436.48 --> 2440.48]  Uh, like, like, Burkle's best style of rap videos.
[2440.48 --> 2441.48]  Oh.
[2441.48 --> 2443.48]  Those would be the best rap videos.
[2443.48 --> 2448.48]  Ghost says play the lap ride- the lap ride- the rap live on stream.
[2448.48 --> 2451.48]  I can't, I'm not- I can't figure out what's going on, but my laptop isn't passing through
[2451.48 --> 2454.48]  audio over HDMI, so I can't.
[2454.48 --> 2459.48]  Um, normally my laptop sound works into the capture card, but it's not working right now.
[2459.48 --> 2464.48]  Um, do do do do do do do do.
[2464.48 --> 2467.48]  Will you say- will you do a goodbye video for the kitchen?
[2467.48 --> 2468.48]  Not very likely.
[2468.48 --> 2474.48]  I've never actually been organized enough when moving sets to, uh, to do like a farewell.
[2474.48 --> 2481.48]  Although, one thing that was kind of funny was- I don't know how many of you remember the old NCIX Tech Tips set with the graffiti in the back,
[2481.48 --> 2492.48]  but there was a video that sat unedited for like a couple months that didn't get released until a couple months after we'd started releasing videos on a new set.
[2492.48 --> 2494.48]  Like, ages after that.
[2494.48 --> 2496.48]  And people were like, oh, holy crap, he moved back to the old set.
[2496.48 --> 2497.48]  No, no.
[2497.48 --> 2498.48]  No.
[2498.48 --> 2506.48]  Um, John says, do you think Linus Media Group will ever become LMG with Linus in an executive non-facing role?
[2506.48 --> 2516.48]  Um, I mean, I think that the very, very long-term outlook would obviously be that I don't want to be standing in front of the camera making every single video forever.
[2516.48 --> 2521.48]  But, that doesn't mean that I ever want to be completely off camera.
[2521.48 --> 2524.48]  So, it's- it's gonna depend on how things go.
[2524.48 --> 2530.48]  I mean, if- okay, let's look at other channels that have tried to replace their key personalities.
[2530.48 --> 2531.48]  Sometimes it goes well.
[2531.48 --> 2533.48]  Um, sometimes it doesn't.
[2533.48 --> 2541.48]  I mean, if I brought in a personality that you guys ended up loving ten times more than me, and it's like, yeah, it kinda sucks when Linus comes back and does stuff, then great.
[2541.48 --> 2549.48]  And, if I bring in guys that suck and I can never find anyone who's as good as me, other than him, then I guess it'll just be the him show.
[2549.48 --> 2553.48]  Um, no, but then- then I'll- I'll stick around for longer.
[2553.48 --> 2557.48]  Like, it's- and it- and it- it comes down to, like, what I'm excited about, too.
[2557.48 --> 2558.48]  Like, you guys tell me this.
[2558.48 --> 2562.48]  When it's a product that I'm really amped about, the video comes across better.
[2562.48 --> 2563.48]  And that's always been true.
[2563.48 --> 2570.48]  If I stop being amped about technology, I'm not gonna be doing you guys or anyone any favors by continuing to make the videos.
[2570.48 --> 2576.48]  And I would be better off trying to find someone to replace me, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.
[2579.48 --> 2580.48]  Um...
[2580.48 --> 2589.48]  RISE J says, you guys get so many GPUs to review, why don't you do giveaways, because there's no way you use them all.
[2589.48 --> 2599.48]  Actually, we use a lot more than you'd think for internal workstations and stuff like that, and we also have to have some kind of permission in place to give away stuff.
[2599.48 --> 2602.48]  Um, that's typically the way it works with samples.
[2602.48 --> 2605.48]  And we kinda have to have them for video card showdowns.
[2605.48 --> 2608.48]  Yes, that's another one, too. And we try not to ask for a half-
[2608.48 --> 2610.48]  Don't take my GPUs!
[2610.48 --> 2617.48]  Yeah, we try not to ask for half a dozen copies of one card, because then we'd have to do half a dozen reviews of a given card, and you guys would get bored.
[2617.48 --> 2623.48]  So most cards, we only have one of, and there's only a few that we have more than one.
[2623.48 --> 2624.48]  That's amazing!
[2624.48 --> 2625.48]  That's super sick!
[2625.48 --> 2626.48]  Oh my god!
[2626.48 --> 2627.48]  That's awesome!
[2627.48 --> 2628.48]  Where do I find that?
[2628.48 --> 2629.48]  I'll send it to you.
[2629.48 --> 2630.48]  I want it to you.
[2630.48 --> 2631.48]  I'll send you the...
[2631.48 --> 2632.48]  Oops...
[2633.48 --> 2635.48]  You got it, too?
[2635.48 --> 2637.48]  Or send it to you, too.
[2637.48 --> 2638.48]  Send it to me, too.
[2638.48 --> 2639.48]  Minus...
[2639.48 --> 2644.48]  Then I'll spam it in Twitch chat, too.
[2644.48 --> 2647.48]  Hold on, I'm gonna spam this in Twitch...
[2647.48 --> 2648.48]  Oh, you already did that one.
[2648.48 --> 2649.48]  Yeah.
[2649.48 --> 2650.48]  Okay.
[2650.48 --> 2651.48]  Cause the wrap is ready.
[2655.48 --> 2658.48]  Okay, I gotta show you guys this fan art.
[2658.48 --> 2659.48]  This is awesome.
[2659.48 --> 2667.48]  No offense to all of our...
[2667.48 --> 2668.48]  Oh.
[2668.48 --> 2669.48]  Well, yeah, that link isn't working.
[2669.48 --> 2670.48]  How are you on the site?
[2670.48 --> 2672.48]  Uh, I just got on it.
[2672.48 --> 2673.48]  Oh, okay.
[2673.48 --> 2674.48]  I'll spam the imagery link, too.
[2674.48 --> 2678.48]  Wait, well, you spammed it in the chat just now?
[2678.48 --> 2679.48]  Imager link, yeah.
[2679.48 --> 2681.48]  Oh, but you spammed the other one first?
[2681.48 --> 2682.48]  Yeah.
[2682.48 --> 2683.48]  That thing is happening.
[2683.48 --> 2684.48]  Oh, sorry.
[2684.48 --> 2685.48]  That thing...
[2685.48 --> 2692.48]  The thing that you don't like that happens sometimes that you understand that happens
[2692.48 --> 2693.48]  that causes the form to go down?
[2693.48 --> 2694.48]  The thing I understand?
[2694.48 --> 2697.48]  Yeah, every single time there's a problem with the form, you're like, is it that thing?
[2697.48 --> 2698.48]  Oh, this one?
[2698.48 --> 2699.48]  Uh...
[2699.48 --> 2700.48]  Yeah, that one?
[2700.48 --> 2701.48]  That one.
[2701.48 --> 2702.48]  Oh, that one.
[2702.48 --> 2703.48]  That one.
[2703.48 --> 2704.48]  Oh, okay.
[2704.48 --> 2705.48]  Just that again, then.
[2705.48 --> 2706.48]  I need to find a way to just...
[2706.48 --> 2711.48]  Turn that freaking thing off.
[2711.48 --> 2728.48]  Okay, well, at any rate, for those of you who didn't click on Nick's spam, we'll do
[2728.48 --> 2729.48]  a screen share here.
[2729.48 --> 2730.48]  The WAN show.
[2730.48 --> 2731.48]  That internet, yo.
[2731.48 --> 2732.48]  That's awesome.
[2732.48 --> 2734.48]  I really like that.
[2734.48 --> 2735.48]  Which one?
[2735.48 --> 2738.48]  The younger Jennifer Aniston right next to it?
[2738.48 --> 2739.48]  Yeah.
[2739.48 --> 2741.48]  That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[2741.48 --> 2744.48]  Are you too young for Jennifer Aniston to even really be a big deal to you?
[2744.48 --> 2747.48]  I just don't know the names of movie stars, to be honest with you.
[2747.48 --> 2748.48]  No, I don't know.
[2748.48 --> 2749.48]  You don't even know Jennifer Aniston.
[2749.48 --> 2751.48]  I would have to look her up.
[2751.48 --> 2752.48]  You must be too young.
[2752.48 --> 2753.48]  I would have to look her up.
[2753.48 --> 2754.48]  Cause you were...
[2754.48 --> 2757.48]  Okay, cause Friends was a big deal when I was just...
[2757.48 --> 2758.48]  Did she have Friends?
[2758.48 --> 2759.48]  Oh, she's that chick.
[2759.48 --> 2760.48]  Oh, yeah.
[2760.48 --> 2762.48]  Like, every male had a crush on her.
[2762.48 --> 2765.48]  I never watched Friends too, so there's that.
[2765.48 --> 2766.48]  Yeah.
[2766.48 --> 2767.48]  That is awesome.
[2767.48 --> 2769.48]  I really like that photo a lot.
[2769.48 --> 2770.48]  I like it a lot.
[2770.48 --> 2771.48]  Or the picture.
[2771.48 --> 2773.48]  Not photo, what am I talking about?
[2774.48 --> 2776.48]  He captured the shark perfectly.
[2776.48 --> 2777.48]  Yeah.
[2777.48 --> 2778.48]  Your dolphin is kinda dirty though.
[2778.48 --> 2779.48]  And the dolphin too.
[2779.48 --> 2780.48]  That's what he's doing though.
[2780.48 --> 2781.48]  The dolphin is dirty on the...
[2781.48 --> 2782.48]  Yeah, that's what he's doing.
[2782.48 --> 2783.48]  Yeah, dude.
[2783.48 --> 2784.48]  He's like, meh.
[2784.48 --> 2785.48]  He looks ridiculous.
[2785.48 --> 2786.48]  That's awesome.
[2786.48 --> 2787.48]  That's great.
[2791.48 --> 2797.48]  Alright, let's see if I'm actually gonna manage to post the mega link.
[2797.48 --> 2798.48]  Here we go.
[2798.48 --> 2799.48]  Alright, let's try this again.
[2799.48 --> 2800.48]  Nope, that's not the one.
[2800.48 --> 2802.48]  The upload finally finished.
[2820.48 --> 2821.48]  Okay, Twitch chat.
[2821.48 --> 2823.48]  Thanks for hanging around with us for After Party.
[2823.48 --> 2825.48]  There's like 3,800 of you.
[2825.48 --> 2826.48]  Yeah, that's insane.
[2826.48 --> 2828.48]  We're not calling you insane.
[2828.48 --> 2829.48]  Nick.
[2829.48 --> 2832.48]  It's insane that that many people are here.
[2832.48 --> 2834.48]  He said that as in the situation.
[2834.48 --> 2835.48]  Yeah, the situation is insane.
[2835.48 --> 2836.48]  Not them.
[2836.48 --> 2837.48]  I didn't say they are insane.
[2837.48 --> 2838.48]  They are awesome.
[2838.48 --> 2840.48]  You will not insult our viewers!
[2840.48 --> 2844.48]  I was inspired by the...
[2844.48 --> 2845.48]  Whoa, whoa.
[2845.48 --> 2846.48]  What is even happening?
[2846.48 --> 2847.48]  I'm ending up in his lap.
[2847.48 --> 2848.48]  Yeah.
[2848.48 --> 2849.48]  This is bad.
[2849.48 --> 2850.48]  You're bad.
[2850.48 --> 2851.48]  You're bad.
[2851.48 --> 2852.48]  You're bad.
[2852.48 --> 2853.48]  Stop.
[2853.48 --> 2854.48]  That's for after the show.
[2854.48 --> 2855.48]  People say link broke.
[2855.48 --> 2856.48]  Why is the link broken?
[2856.48 --> 2857.48]  What?
[2859.48 --> 2860.48]  What link broken?
[2861.48 --> 2863.48]  People are saying copy paste the whole thing.
[2863.48 --> 2864.48]  What whole thing?
[2864.48 --> 2865.48]  That is the whole thing.
[2865.48 --> 2868.48]  Pretty sure it breaks after the hashtag like I was saying earlier.
[2868.48 --> 2869.48]  Oh, is that what you said?
[2869.48 --> 2870.48]  I didn't hear you.
[2870.48 --> 2871.48]  Jerk.
[2871.48 --> 2873.48]  Alright, I'll go find a...
[2873.48 --> 2874.48]  Yes.
[2874.48 --> 2877.48]  Maybe if you could keep our website up for four seconds.
[2877.48 --> 2878.48]  Maybe if you could be a butt.
[2878.48 --> 2883.48]  Apparently you have to copy and paste the link is twitchdoesntsupport.co.nz links.
[2883.48 --> 2885.48]  I'll just create a bitly.
[2887.48 --> 2889.48]  Alright, bitly link, inbound.
[2889.48 --> 2890.48]  We will get this.
[2890.48 --> 2893.48]  And then everyone is going to get this and then they are just going to leave because they'll
[2893.48 --> 2894.48]  be done.
[2894.48 --> 2896.48]  That's what they've been sitting here waiting for.
[2896.48 --> 2897.48]  That's what they've been waiting for.
[2897.48 --> 2899.48]  Oh my goodness, bitly's automatically convert.
[2899.48 --> 2900.48]  I think.
[2900.48 --> 2901.48]  Hold on.
[2901.48 --> 2902.48]  Let me try again.
[2902.48 --> 2903.48]  Nope, no, no, no, no.
[2903.48 --> 2904.48]  It just didn't...
[2904.48 --> 2905.48]  The copy didn't take.
[2905.48 --> 2906.48]  There we go.
[2906.48 --> 2907.48]  That should finally be it.
[2907.48 --> 2908.48]  Okay, and then we should be good now.
[2908.48 --> 2909.48]  People are saying what's the decryption code?
[2909.48 --> 2910.48]  What should we find now?
[2910.48 --> 2911.48]  Decryption code?
[2911.48 --> 2912.48]  It should have been included.
[2912.48 --> 2917.48]  I've never used Mega before but there's a checkbox that says include decryption...
[2917.48 --> 2918.48]  Oh, that probably...
[2918.48 --> 2920.48]  Include the requirement for the code.
[2920.48 --> 2921.48]  Ah.
[2921.48 --> 2922.48]  No, wait.
[2922.48 --> 2923.48]  Hold on.
[2923.48 --> 2924.48]  No, no, include file key is...
[2924.48 --> 2925.48]  It should be included.
[2925.48 --> 2926.48]  Yeah, I just clicked it and I clicked one button and you can download it.
[2926.48 --> 2927.48]  Yeah.
[2927.48 --> 2928.48]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2928.48 --> 2929.48]  File key is included.
[2929.48 --> 2930.48]  Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and see what's going on.
[2930.48 --> 2931.48]  I'm going to go ahead and see what's going on.
[2931.48 --> 2932.48]  I'm going to go ahead and see what's going on.
[2932.48 --> 2933.48]  I'm going to go ahead and see what's going on.
[2933.48 --> 2934.48]  What's going on is the requirement for the code?
[2934.48 --> 2935.48]  Inclu...
[2935.48 --> 2936.48]  Ah.
[2936.48 --> 2937.48]  No, wait.
[2937.48 --> 2938.48]  Hold on.
[2938.48 --> 2939.48]  No, no, include file key is...
[2939.48 --> 2940.48]  It should be included.
[2940.48 --> 2943.48]  Yeah, I just clicked it and I clicked one button and you can download it.
[2943.48 --> 2944.48]  Yeah.
[2944.48 --> 2945.48]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[2945.48 --> 2948.48]  File key is included.
[2948.48 --> 2953.48]  They were like stop talking so I can click it.
[2953.48 --> 2962.48]  Ed Simon says got the wrap, peace, I'm out.
[2962.48 --> 2968.28]  This rap is so cringe.
[2968.62 --> 2969.26]  I know!
[2969.74 --> 2970.40]  I know!
[2971.34 --> 2973.66]  The only thing that made it somewhat okay
[2973.66 --> 2975.18]  was the Stormtrooper filter.
[2975.18 --> 2976.84]  The joke of my imperial style.
[2976.84 --> 2977.80]  Okay, can you not?
[2978.38 --> 2980.56]  If I don't have to listen to it,
[2980.60 --> 2981.56]  at least there's that.
[2984.62 --> 2985.18]  Ugh.
[2986.86 --> 2987.66]  Oh, no.
[2988.42 --> 2991.12]  Awpickness says adding this to my phone.
[2992.48 --> 2994.36]  Oh my god, we should make it a ringtone.
[2994.88 --> 2995.36]  Oh!
[2995.56 --> 2996.74]  It's not as good as my ringtone.
[2996.96 --> 2997.10]  No.
[2997.94 --> 3000.78]  You don't really want your ringtone
[3000.78 --> 3002.32]  to have cuss words in it, do you?
[3004.14 --> 3005.88]  My ringtone has something
[3005.88 --> 3008.42]  I'm taking away your phone plan.
[3009.00 --> 3011.30]  I'm taking away your phone plan.
[3011.38 --> 3012.28]  I don't have mine yet.
[3012.68 --> 3014.22]  I don't have mine yet either!
[3016.16 --> 3017.04]  Oh, man.
[3020.38 --> 3022.34]  Someone says prepare for the remixes.
[3022.48 --> 3025.54]  Apparently .co.nz is not supported by Twitch?
[3025.62 --> 3027.46]  Yeah, that's what Nape was saying.
[3027.82 --> 3028.26]  What?
[3029.64 --> 3030.84]  That's so dumb!
[3031.06 --> 3032.58]  Alright, here's another copy of the Bitly
[3032.58 --> 3034.30]  for those of you who missed it the first time.
[3034.98 --> 3037.26]  Somebody said 50k donation
[3037.26 --> 3038.80]  should be for wrapping lessons, maybe?
[3039.82 --> 3040.46]  Oh, no.
[3040.46 --> 3040.58]  Thanks.
[3041.58 --> 3043.78]  No amount of lessons can fix me.
[3043.78 --> 3045.94]  No, I think he was saying
[3045.94 --> 3049.52]  we should have a contributor tier
[3049.52 --> 3050.98]  where they pay 50k to do
[3050.98 --> 3052.60]  wrapping lessons with Linus.
[3054.14 --> 3055.48]  To teach me to rap?
[3055.70 --> 3055.94]  No.
[3056.16 --> 3057.10]  A contributor tier for 50k?
[3057.10 --> 3058.26]  I teach them to rap.
[3059.70 --> 3060.12]  Oh, man.
[3060.12 --> 3061.98]  It was Twitch chat, I should just stop talking.
[3062.12 --> 3062.36]  Right.
[3062.80 --> 3063.00]  Yeah.
[3063.64 --> 3065.94]  You can't speak what happens in Twitch chat.
[3065.98 --> 3066.56]  Yeah, it just doesn't happen.
[3066.56 --> 3067.84]  It just starts melting brains.
[3067.84 --> 3072.28]  Twitch chat is like one of the few places
[3072.28 --> 3074.86]  where the text actually makes more sense
[3074.86 --> 3075.88]  than the spoken word.
[3076.18 --> 3077.84]  Okay, so for those of you
[3077.84 --> 3079.86]  who haven't even heard
[3079.86 --> 3084.10]  the proper Stormtrooper version of it,
[3084.74 --> 3085.84]  there's a...
[3086.52 --> 3089.14]  I feel compelled to share that
[3089.14 --> 3092.08]  since the other one is so bad.
[3093.14 --> 3094.90]  Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[3094.90 --> 3096.06]  Um...
[3096.06 --> 3098.14]  Pro tip, the intro wasn't even Linus.
[3098.54 --> 3100.00]  Yeah, yeah, actually, that's...
[3100.00 --> 3101.74]  There's some behind-the-scenes
[3101.74 --> 3103.36]  fun stuff for you guys.
[3103.96 --> 3104.92]  Yeah, that was you.
[3105.06 --> 3106.00]  The intro was me,
[3106.08 --> 3108.12]  and I remember that Luke
[3108.12 --> 3112.02]  was like super sick that day
[3112.02 --> 3115.04]  and came in anyways to help us out.
[3116.14 --> 3118.30]  And Linus, was that like your first day
[3118.30 --> 3120.42]  of paternity leave or something?
[3120.68 --> 3121.18]  I think so.
[3121.50 --> 3121.78]  Yeah.
[3123.56 --> 3124.76]  I don't hear any sound.
[3124.90 --> 3129.16]  Why don't I hear sound?
[3130.36 --> 3131.88]  Well, whatever, you guys have the...
[3131.88 --> 3132.94]  No, because I want you to hear...
[3132.94 --> 3133.24]  What?
[3134.44 --> 3135.36]  Can they hear sound?
[3135.62 --> 3136.14]  I don't know.
[3141.84 --> 3142.94]  Okay, to be clear,
[3143.06 --> 3144.60]  it is me in the outfit.
[3145.78 --> 3146.80]  For almost all of it.
[3146.82 --> 3147.64]  For almost all of it.
[3147.64 --> 3148.16]  The whole rap video.
[3148.28 --> 3149.62]  Yeah, for the actual rap video.
[3150.08 --> 3150.56]  Just the intro part.
[3150.56 --> 3151.74]  Intro where the music's playing.
[3152.30 --> 3152.74]  That girl.
[3153.00 --> 3153.70]  Yeah, she was awesome.
[3154.64 --> 3156.14]  She's like showing up like,
[3156.24 --> 3157.64]  hey, come here for the rap video.
[3158.32 --> 3158.60]  All right.
[3159.46 --> 3161.48]  Brandon did a good job of the...
[3161.48 --> 3162.74]  of the filming on this.
[3162.74 --> 3163.32]  The shaky cam?
[3163.54 --> 3163.80]  Yeah.
[3164.92 --> 3165.82]  Oh yeah, that was...
[3165.82 --> 3166.64]  They lose here.
[3166.72 --> 3167.60]  Yeah, that was fun.
[3167.70 --> 3168.44]  That was awesome.
[3168.44 --> 3172.76]  Like Ed's cheesy force lightning.
[3175.76 --> 3177.22]  Luke, obviously breathing.
[3181.42 --> 3182.06]  Yeah, man.
[3182.14 --> 3183.46]  We were trying to keep it G-rated.
[3184.40 --> 3185.34]  With all the swearing.
[3185.40 --> 3186.44]  With all the swearing, yeah.
[3186.52 --> 3187.64]  In spite of all the swearing.
[3188.74 --> 3189.48]  Chrome mute.
[3189.64 --> 3190.94]  Your Chrome was muted, apparently.
[3191.42 --> 3192.28]  Chrome was muted?
[3192.42 --> 3194.12]  Oh, was that in Mixer?
[3194.18 --> 3195.54]  Oh, Chrome is muted in Mixer.
[3195.54 --> 3196.98]  Why is Chrome muted in Mixer?
[3196.98 --> 3197.64]  Oh, rip.
[3198.72 --> 3199.84]  Okay, okay, okay.
[3199.90 --> 3201.18]  Well, we're gonna watch one more time
[3201.18 --> 3202.60]  with actual sound this time then.
[3204.20 --> 3204.92]  Here we go.
[3205.20 --> 3207.20]  Okay, add screen region.
[3207.96 --> 3208.86]  Full thing.
[3209.40 --> 3209.76]  Boom.
[3212.14 --> 3213.40]  Okay, yes, it's full screen.
[3213.50 --> 3213.82]  I get it.
[3213.86 --> 3214.16]  Go away.
[3216.24 --> 3217.58]  Okay, so this is where it's me.
[3217.68 --> 3218.58]  It's Nick before that.
[3223.08 --> 3223.84]  Oh, my God.
[3223.84 --> 3225.98]  Oh, my God.
[3225.98 --> 3228.32]  WeALL, my God.
[3228.76 --> 3228.86]  Yeah, it is the music.
[3228.92 --> 3238.08]  Oh, my God away.
[3250.04 --> 3250.32]  Come on.
[3250.32 --> 3263.38]  I hear you just fine. That's it. It's over now, but I can see why you tried. Your music won't have been great with these except that you died. They go protruding and perfect bass too. So good effort, but better luck next time, fool.
[3263.90 --> 3265.32]  Well, there's just a ballin' ass.
[3265.32 --> 3267.56]  What the hell did I just watch?
[3267.92 --> 3270.52]  Yeah. Rap video swag.
[3270.92 --> 3273.68]  That video was way too much fun to make.
[3273.68 --> 3274.58]  For sure.
[3274.88 --> 3287.40]  That took forever, and the timing was terrible because we were trying to get the song written, recorded, and get everything shot right leading up to when I was leaving to have a baby.
[3287.70 --> 3287.94]  Yeah.
[3288.64 --> 3290.88]  That was crazy.
[3291.90 --> 3292.30]  There you go.
[3292.60 --> 3296.54]  A lot of fun, though. It was a lot of fun. We had a good time.
[3298.32 --> 3300.14]  What the hell did I just watch?
[3300.80 --> 3302.72]  I'm so stoked to wear this.
[3302.72 --> 3304.18]  Just around?
[3304.48 --> 3304.76]  Yeah.
[3305.80 --> 3306.00]  Yeah.
[3306.58 --> 3308.22]  Did I tell you that I ordered two?
[3308.70 --> 3317.22]  I ordered two of those style sweaters. One is Santa on a Stegosaurus, and the other is Santa on a Game of Thrones candy cane chair.
[3317.68 --> 3318.74]  That's ridiculous.
[3319.26 --> 3321.86]  I've never even watched Game of Thrones. It's awesome.
[3323.50 --> 3324.30]  That's great.
[3325.60 --> 3328.74]  People are saying, do we have permission to mix and put this on YouTube?
[3329.38 --> 3329.96]  You know what?
[3329.98 --> 3330.36]  Heck yeah.
[3330.36 --> 3337.24]  Crowdfunding campaign paid for this to be released, so it's out there.
[3337.34 --> 3339.74]  I think no matter what you say, it's going to happen.
[3339.86 --> 3340.66]  Yeah, basically.
[3340.66 --> 3355.40]  The sweaters came from Amazon. Let me see if we can figure out what the designer's name is.
[3355.40 --> 3370.64]  Alex Stevens. Alex Stevens on Amazon. A-L-E-X. Stevens with a V is where we got those sweaters from.
[3371.16 --> 3371.54]  Okay.
[3371.54 --> 3377.60]  The worst part is that it was better than 90% of the wrap-outs, says WikiKid.
[3379.70 --> 3380.64]  That's awesome.
[3381.70 --> 3393.20]  Well, we've ended up not really talking about the crowdfunding campaign much. I guess I must have addressed it pretty well with the Q&A, because people really didn't have a lot of questions about it.
[3393.20 --> 3398.20]  I think the serious dialing back of the stretch goals was just like, all right.
[3398.38 --> 3399.76]  Yeah, but we were going to do that anyway.
[3399.88 --> 3400.14]  I know.
[3400.14 --> 3406.80]  But, and you know, if we were smart, we would have launched it in the middle of the day, so we could have done that throughout the actual day, but yeah.
[3406.80 --> 3406.86]  Yeah.
[3406.86 --> 3419.64]  Someone asked, why aren't I wearing the Moto 360? I switched back to the iPhone 6 so that I can use it for part of my iMac switched thing, so that I can try out the continuity features.
[3419.96 --> 3423.20]  And the iPhone 6 doesn't support the Moto 360, so I'm back on the Pebble Steel.
[3423.44 --> 3426.24]  And I'm also done all my notes for my Moto 360 review.
[3426.24 --> 3440.60]  So, I had to stop using my Droid Turbo, because I dropped it off at the office for them to shoot B-roll of it today, and switch back to the iPhone 6, and I'm done with my notes for the Moto 360, and the Moto 360 I don't really intend to continue using once I'm done with the review, so.
[3441.60 --> 3441.96]  Wrecked.
[3442.28 --> 3442.94]  There you go.
[3443.82 --> 3444.98]  Wrecked Moto 360.
[3445.72 --> 3446.90]  There's some good stuff about it.
[3447.02 --> 3448.92]  Don't use an old trash processor next time.
[3449.46 --> 3450.76]  This processor's not the problem.
[3451.84 --> 3452.52]  Battery life?
[3452.52 --> 3456.00]  I get a full day, and that's about as good as you're going to get out of any smartwatch.
[3456.00 --> 3456.92]  So they all suck.
[3457.30 --> 3457.46]  Yeah.
[3458.52 --> 3459.36]  Except this one.
[3460.44 --> 3460.74]  Okay.
[3463.48 --> 3465.88]  I want my smartwatch to be able to last for, like, a week.
[3467.70 --> 3469.72]  My phone should last for, like, three days.
[3471.60 --> 3475.40]  The Droid Turbo, by the way, oh, this isn't it, but I don't know if you're going to watch the review.
[3476.08 --> 3476.96]  I probably will.
[3477.18 --> 3480.08]  But it's not a two-day battery, and that's stupid.
[3480.48 --> 3483.40]  I think I call it, quote-unquote, ridiculous in the video.
[3483.40 --> 3485.46]  I think we knew that before it came.
[3485.46 --> 3485.74]  Yeah.
[3485.90 --> 3489.76]  Because they're like, oh, it's a two-day battery or whatever, and then you read the battery spec, and it's like, no, it's not.
[3489.84 --> 3490.98]  Like, if you have an Xperia...
[3490.98 --> 3491.32]  Is it good?
[3491.58 --> 3494.98]  If you have an Xperia Z2 already, that's a 3200 milliamp hour battery.
[3494.98 --> 3507.60]  So if you have 30% left at the end of the day, which is 25% to 30% is what I typically end up with with an Xperia, then it has to last in standby all night, which on Android we all know is not good.
[3507.60 --> 3513.90]  So you're going to have maybe 20% in the morning, 15% in the morning, depending on how much crap you left running.
[3514.16 --> 3515.98]  That gives you 15% for the next day.
[3515.98 --> 3523.88]  So if this other phone has 20% more battery than that, then you're going to have 35% for the next day.
[3524.76 --> 3525.16]  Obviously.
[3525.66 --> 3526.32]  Which is not above 15.
[3526.32 --> 3528.96]  And the next day, because they said 48 hours.
[3529.12 --> 3530.22]  They didn't say two days.
[3530.46 --> 3531.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[3531.02 --> 3533.18]  The next day would be an entire another 24-hour period.
[3533.28 --> 3534.02]  That's not going to happen.
[3534.14 --> 3534.76]  No, no.
[3535.86 --> 3536.04]  Yeah.
[3536.34 --> 3537.18]  I didn't expect it to be.
[3537.32 --> 3540.46]  Mango says, no offense, it sounds so horrible.
[3541.06 --> 3541.60]  I know.
[3541.98 --> 3545.76]  I was, like, I was mortified when I was recording it.
[3546.00 --> 3547.48]  I wanted him to leave.
[3547.48 --> 3550.44]  He was busy setting up the Oculus.
[3550.44 --> 3554.88]  I think this is the only time he's ever, like, wanted me to not be there.
[3554.88 --> 3557.74]  And I tried to, I was off in, like, a kind of a side room.
[3558.48 --> 3560.20]  And I tried to be as quiet as I could.
[3560.26 --> 3561.76]  And I, like, put headphones in and stuff.
[3562.94 --> 3564.82]  And I was trying to, like, usher people away.
[3565.10 --> 3566.70]  And, like, that was the good take.
[3567.00 --> 3570.74]  Like, when I was first trying, oh, it's embarrassing.
[3571.72 --> 3574.52]  Like, I feel stupid doing it.
[3577.18 --> 3577.50]  Yeah.
[3577.50 --> 3577.64]  Yeah.
[3582.88 --> 3583.20]  Ha.
[3583.54 --> 3586.08]  Ant asks, will you have air conditioning at the new place?
[3586.44 --> 3586.94]  I don't know.
[3587.02 --> 3588.98]  I guess it depends whether we hit that stretch goal or not.
[3590.04 --> 3590.86]  Oh, jeez.
[3592.54 --> 3592.82]  Oh, jeez.
[3592.82 --> 3593.82]  Linus the tyrant.
[3594.36 --> 3595.36]  Where is that one?
[3595.54 --> 3596.54]  I want that one.
[3597.32 --> 3597.92]  Air conditioning?
[3598.20 --> 3598.58]  Yeah.
[3598.76 --> 3599.54]  I want that one.
[3600.40 --> 3603.96]  I can tell you the warehouse won't be air conditioned.
[3604.34 --> 3604.70]  Right.
[3604.84 --> 3605.90]  And that's where we're going to be filming.
[3605.96 --> 3607.56]  Because that's just not typical.
[3608.54 --> 3611.26]  We can just get those, like, industrial fans, though.
[3611.76 --> 3613.36]  And just, like, blow air through.
[3613.40 --> 3614.04]  Right at the mics?
[3614.36 --> 3617.50]  Sean asked, when is your 980 classified being coming?
[3617.50 --> 3618.38]  No, like, we should do it right at the mics.
[3618.64 --> 3619.80]  What does that even sound like?
[3619.80 --> 3623.62]  When do we have 980 classified on the release schedule for?
[3624.32 --> 3625.76]  What are you working on next?
[3625.94 --> 3626.98]  Is it Motherboard Roundup?
[3627.40 --> 3628.76]  What do you even do all day?
[3628.76 --> 3629.52]  Dragon Age.
[3629.68 --> 3630.82]  Oh, lordy Dragon Age.
[3630.84 --> 3631.56]  With the new thing.
[3631.62 --> 3633.22]  Does that system boot yet?
[3633.44 --> 3633.72]  No.
[3633.96 --> 3635.24]  I brought the Dominators back.
[3635.34 --> 3636.24]  I was managing all this.
[3636.54 --> 3636.94]  I know.
[3637.38 --> 3637.58]  Junk.
[3638.16 --> 3638.70]  Well, not junk.
[3638.86 --> 3641.08]  That's, uh...
[3641.08 --> 3642.88]  Are you actually wondering when you have it on the calendar?
[3644.30 --> 3645.80]  Oh, no, the calendars.
[3645.80 --> 3646.76]  Nick actually goes and figures it out.
[3646.76 --> 3649.00]  Oh, apparently it's on the calendar for Monday.
[3649.20 --> 3649.72]  But then there's...
[3649.72 --> 3652.88]  The GPU showdown for Dragon Age is also on Monday.
[3653.04 --> 3654.18]  Yeah, I think that's...
[3654.18 --> 3656.08]  Yeah, it'll be one of those, too.
[3656.28 --> 3657.52]  You didn't get a chance to look at this, right?
[3657.52 --> 3658.52]  The...
[3658.52 --> 3659.52]  The...
[3659.52 --> 3660.18]  Yeah, yeah.
[3660.22 --> 3660.98]  I checked them out last night.
[3661.04 --> 3661.38]  They're nice.
[3661.88 --> 3662.58]  Did you, like, listen?
[3662.72 --> 3662.88]  Yeah.
[3663.14 --> 3663.96]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3664.18 --> 3664.24]  Cool.
[3664.24 --> 3665.50]  Because I want to get...
[3665.50 --> 3666.08]  They're looking good.
[3666.34 --> 3666.58]  Cool.
[3667.48 --> 3668.82]  Are you going to keep those ones?
[3668.98 --> 3669.46]  Not sure.
[3671.58 --> 3672.14]  Uh...
[3672.14 --> 3673.88]  Will you do more Apple product reviews?
[3673.98 --> 3674.44]  Sure, why not?
[3675.52 --> 3676.38]  I don't see why not.
[3676.38 --> 3681.16]  New stretch goal idea?
[3681.38 --> 3683.06]  Make the rap Linus's ringtone.
[3684.02 --> 3684.94]  Not going to happen.
[3685.12 --> 3685.40]  No.
[3686.50 --> 3687.38]  Did you see...
[3687.38 --> 3689.16]  Will asks if we speak any other languages.
[3689.98 --> 3694.24]  I used to be somewhat conversant in French, but it's been a really long time, like 10 years.
[3694.78 --> 3695.38]  And I used to be...
[3695.38 --> 3702.96]  I have functional enough American Sign Language to, like, order food or, like, tell someone
[3702.96 --> 3703.72]  where the bathroom is.
[3703.88 --> 3706.38]  I used to have fairly functional...
[3706.38 --> 3707.38]  German.
[3707.38 --> 3707.82]  German.
[3707.82 --> 3708.22]  German.
[3708.70 --> 3710.00]  I wish I could still speak German.
[3710.20 --> 3711.22]  Yeah, Nick did, too.
[3712.38 --> 3712.78]  Not...
[3712.78 --> 3715.12]  I speak German not so well.
[3715.78 --> 3716.60]  Not Benjamin.
[3716.84 --> 3721.04]  How do you personally deal with, slash, prevent the indentation of your hair that results
[3721.04 --> 3722.34]  from wearing headphones for long hours?
[3722.46 --> 3727.18]  Well, I don't know if you've ever seen any behind-the-scenes pictures of me, but I don't
[3727.18 --> 3728.76]  really wear headphones very much.
[3728.88 --> 3729.70]  I just go like this.
[3729.94 --> 3733.14]  Unless I'm at home, and then it's usually night time, and I don't care.
[3733.28 --> 3733.84]  People won't see me.
[3734.06 --> 3738.66]  It happens to me, but yeah, just, like, fluff it up and then flatten it back down.
[3738.66 --> 3742.42]  Jason says we should totally do a cooking video in the kitchen to say farewell to it.
[3742.42 --> 3744.56]  I've done a cooking video in that kitchen.
[3745.74 --> 3748.88]  That was where I did Cooking with Slick, my, like, most watched livestream ever.
[3750.22 --> 3751.20]  I'm not even kidding.
[3751.84 --> 3756.86]  I made chicken, and then people cared a lot more about that than my video games.
[3757.06 --> 3759.02]  This is how you impress a girl with chicken.
[3759.16 --> 3760.84]  That was the whole premise of the video.
[3761.26 --> 3765.68]  And I even tied it into, like, this is how you impress her while you're cooking, and,
[3765.68 --> 3768.12]  like, after you're done cooking and before you're cooking.
[3768.82 --> 3769.26]  Yeah.
[3769.26 --> 3773.24]  The captain asks, which WAN show goal are you most nervous about?
[3773.30 --> 3773.82]  There's a few.
[3774.14 --> 3776.36]  The upper body paint could be really terrible.
[3776.84 --> 3777.54]  That's LTT.
[3777.82 --> 3781.32]  The shock collars, oh, which, no, just which goal, sorry.
[3781.46 --> 3781.78]  Uh-oh.
[3781.88 --> 3783.98]  The shock collars could be really bad.
[3784.96 --> 3785.32]  Yeah.
[3785.92 --> 3789.16]  Painting my car bright pink could be pretty interesting.
[3789.46 --> 3790.98]  My wife doesn't know about that.
[3791.12 --> 3791.74]  Oh, no.
[3793.08 --> 3794.02]  Oh, no.
[3794.34 --> 3795.74]  And it's, like, paint rollers.
[3795.74 --> 3797.66]  Well, they can bring it up on WAN show, are they?
[3798.02 --> 3798.34]  Yeah.
[3798.54 --> 3798.86]  Yeah.
[3799.00 --> 3799.36]  Oh.
[3799.92 --> 3804.46]  My wife is pretty nervous about appearing as a guest on WAN show, so that happens at 65,000.
[3804.74 --> 3805.40]  How is that?
[3805.48 --> 3806.78]  How is the, oh, yeah.
[3807.14 --> 3809.14]  How is the, like, infrastructure for that even going to work?
[3809.34 --> 3809.98]  We'll figure it out.
[3810.10 --> 3810.22]  Yeah.
[3810.34 --> 3811.88]  Get someone to watch the kids.
[3814.40 --> 3817.02]  Brian Wilcox asks, why do you not read my tweets?
[3817.02 --> 3820.44]  I get a kick out of that.
[3820.56 --> 3824.40]  Like, when someone tweets me and says, hey, I tweeted you, but you didn't respond.
[3824.98 --> 3827.22]  And I'm just like, I'm, no, not that.
[3827.34 --> 3831.44]  But I'm looking at it going, okay, well, I see it now, but you didn't actually send me
[3831.44 --> 3831.94]  your question.
[3832.16 --> 3834.56]  You haven't linked it to your previous question in any way.
[3835.04 --> 3838.82]  I can't even help you if I wanted to, because I can't, I can't even scroll through all my
[3838.82 --> 3839.42]  tweets properly.
[3839.48 --> 3840.10]  Like, it breaks.
[3840.62 --> 3840.82]  Yeah.
[3840.82 --> 3843.54]  My mentions break depending on which app I'm using.
[3843.54 --> 3844.64]  They break in different ways.
[3845.14 --> 3846.66]  And I can't even access everything.
[3847.02 --> 3852.08]  Mango says, you don't like my fan art or don't even look at them?
[3852.38 --> 3856.04]  Once again, not linked to a previous submission of fan art.
[3856.22 --> 3857.10]  No linked fan art.
[3857.26 --> 3857.74]  I'm sorry.
[3858.34 --> 3861.34]  Muk Fasheen says, garage sale soon?
[3862.60 --> 3866.70]  What I was kind of thinking is when we move, we'll do, like, an in-person moving sale.
[3867.68 --> 3867.90]  Cool.
[3869.44 --> 3870.54]  Get Esther to do this.
[3870.54 --> 3877.86]  Bald Linus is not a thing that's going to happen.
[3878.36 --> 3879.86]  Someone said, where can I submit remixes?
[3880.02 --> 3880.78]  The forum, man.
[3881.82 --> 3882.48]  Yeah, dog.
[3882.96 --> 3883.76]  Post on the forum.
[3884.60 --> 3887.64]  Devin says, I think a comedy channel from you guys would actually be good.
[3887.82 --> 3889.28]  I like your channel because it's not boring.
[3889.46 --> 3890.06]  You make it fun.
[3890.30 --> 3890.80]  Thank you.
[3891.18 --> 3891.46]  Yay.
[3891.46 --> 3893.48]  All right.
[3895.96 --> 3899.30]  Adam says, do you need more employees in this new building with the new goal for the amount
[3899.30 --> 3900.42]  of videos you expect to upload?
[3900.68 --> 3901.04]  Absolutely.
[3901.40 --> 3903.80]  QB and Apple said, how the hell do you transport a mineral oil PC?
[3904.00 --> 3908.46]  We will probably cover that in one of the upcoming episodes.
[3908.70 --> 3910.48]  It's actually not a short topic.
[3910.48 --> 3910.78]  Luke.
[3911.68 --> 3913.28]  So, yeah.
[3914.86 --> 3917.56]  If you're Luke, you just hug it and hope for the best.
[3918.40 --> 3918.68]  Yeah.
[3919.18 --> 3920.88]  Yeah, there's a few stories for that.
[3921.56 --> 3922.78]  The bomb thing.
[3923.42 --> 3924.74]  The bus driver thought it was a bomb.
[3924.76 --> 3925.08]  Oh, yeah.
[3925.08 --> 3925.68]  I told you about that, right?
[3925.80 --> 3925.96]  Yeah.
[3926.50 --> 3926.92]  That was awesome.
[3926.92 --> 3929.10]  Didn't you carry it over to the island, like on the ferry?
[3929.26 --> 3929.94]  Yeah, on the bus.
[3930.06 --> 3935.16]  Well, remember when it cracked after that party, there was, I didn't know what to do,
[3935.44 --> 3938.22]  and I'm like, who's the only handy person I really know?
[3938.22 --> 3943.06]  So, like, my dad, so I'm like, okay, who's going to be able to help me fix this?
[3943.20 --> 3943.76]  My dad.
[3944.10 --> 3950.50]  So I arm carried the entire thing on buses and then ferries and then more buses all the
[3950.50 --> 3950.84]  way home.
[3951.82 --> 3956.24]  So, from the island all the way to my parents' house, my dad helps me fix it.
[3956.88 --> 3958.02]  And it was, like, leaking.
[3960.64 --> 3961.74]  While I was traveling.
[3963.06 --> 3966.46]  And, like, leaking mineral oil is not the same as leaking water.
[3966.68 --> 3966.82]  No.
[3966.82 --> 3970.64]  It's, like, not okay, really.
[3970.70 --> 3970.92]  Yeah.
[3972.56 --> 3977.24]  I did a few things to try and, like, make it so that oil wouldn't get on things, but,
[3977.28 --> 3977.72]  like, yeah.
[3978.94 --> 3981.44]  At the same time, it's still a cracked mineral OPC.
[3981.64 --> 3982.04]  Yeah.
[3982.48 --> 3984.16]  It's still kind of got everywhere.
[3986.16 --> 3986.90]  Uh, oh.
[3987.16 --> 3988.12]  No, I'm not even going to be here.
[3989.68 --> 3990.08]  Okay.
[3990.28 --> 3991.86]  Well, I think I should head home.
[3995.16 --> 3995.90]  See the fam.
[3995.90 --> 3998.22]  Yay, weekend.
[3998.92 --> 4001.10]  Where I can do more work.
[4001.92 --> 4002.32]  Woo!
[4003.32 --> 4006.40]  Time for more work, but also video games for me.
[4007.06 --> 4007.38]  Oh.
[4008.00 --> 4008.96]  Are you playing tonight?
[4009.92 --> 4010.50]  Uh, probably.
[4010.50 --> 4012.22]  Do you want to do what we were planning to do?
[4012.90 --> 4014.02]  I don't know.
[4014.46 --> 4016.08]  I have work to do now.
[4016.08 --> 4016.18]  Okay.
[4016.18 --> 4016.68]  Yay.
[4020.10 --> 4020.62]  Yay.
[4025.30 --> 4025.74]  Yeah.
[4026.20 --> 4027.28]  You know what we should do?
[4027.80 --> 4030.40]  We should hire more people and move into a bigger office.
[4031.06 --> 4031.40]  Oh.
[4031.40 --> 4032.92]  What's the thing for you?
[4033.38 --> 4036.28]  Guys, I think we have to shut down the stream and talk about this.
[4036.76 --> 4037.72]  Yeah, it's a top secret.
[4038.68 --> 4039.06]  Okay.
[4039.30 --> 4039.68]  Peace, guys.
[4039.76 --> 4040.22]  Bye, everyone.
[4040.22 --> 4040.40]  Bye, everyone.

[4042.82 --> 4043.04]  Bye.
[4043.26 --> 4043.44]  Bye.
[4043.44 --> 4043.56]  Bye.
[4043.56 --> 4047.58]  Bye, guys, I think we have to shut down the stream and talk about this.
[4047.58 --> 4049.60]  Yeah, it's a top secret.
[4049.60 --> 4050.26]  Bye, everyone.
[4050.26 --> 4055.06]  Bye, everyone.
[4055.06 --> 4055.90]  Bye, everyone.
[4055.90 --> 4056.90]  Bye.
[4056.90 --> 4058.06]  Bye, everyone.
[4058.06 --> 4058.80]  Bye.
[4058.80 --> 4059.44]  Bye, everyone.
[4059.44 --> 4059.86]  Bye.
