[0.00 --> 10.40]  Okay, WAN Show time again, so I've got a terrific story for you guys, if you're not tired of my excuses for why this show is always late.
[12.08 --> 18.72]  25 minutes! My favorite thing ever is that, like, every time you're gone, we're always five minutes early.
[20.40 --> 28.12]  Well, I was fixing a problem that maybe had you been more on the ball and proactive, we wouldn't have had.
[28.12 --> 35.10]  You're the one that insisted on having the computer streaming that had a zap strap around the heat sink so that it could keep running.
[35.34 --> 42.76]  That zap strap is incredibly reliable technology. Plastic never fails. Plastic holds together.
[42.98 --> 43.90]  Plastic never fails?
[43.94 --> 47.60]  Unless UV. Then plastic fails very quickly.
[48.46 --> 56.96]  So guys, basically what happened is last week we had Paul and Kyle, formerly of Newegg TV, on, and we were dropping frames like mad.
[56.96 --> 66.96]  It was terrible during the stream. So I realized about half an hour before today's stream was supposed to start that we had a guest Skyping in this week.
[66.96 --> 67.96]  We hadn't built the computer yet.
[67.96 --> 76.96]  We hadn't actually swapped out the CPU. We had done nothing to make the computer actually work and not drop frames all over the freaking place.
[76.96 --> 87.96]  So I actually did a motherboard, CPU, RAM swap, reinstalled all the capture cards, reconfigured XSplit because all the capture settings are messed up because they're all in different slots.
[87.96 --> 96.30]  They've got different IDs now because when you have multiple capture cards, it'll arbitrarily, well, this is number one and this is two and this is three.
[96.48 --> 100.12]  So if that changes, XSplit doesn't remember anything. We had to redo the color.
[100.50 --> 107.26]  We've actually, this room has someone's chair in it and desk now because we've added another body here at Linus Media Group.
[107.26 --> 114.24]  So we had to move the entire thing. It's a miracle we're live at all. But of course, what I really meant to say is, I'm sorry.
[115.64 --> 119.18]  And thank you for tuning in and we're going to get on with the show now.
[119.26 --> 120.84]  So we've got a lot of great topics today.
[120.84 --> 121.04]  That's such a genuine story.
[121.04 --> 127.90]  Windows, not, excuse me, 10, 10, Windows 10. There's a technical preview. You can go ahead and download it.
[128.18 --> 136.62]  We'll talk a little bit about what's new in Windows 10 or more specifically, what is old and not the new thing that we hated anymore.
[137.10 --> 142.96]  Also, Tesla is pretty sure that when they show you the D, they are, you are going to want it.
[143.14 --> 143.36]  I do.
[143.92 --> 144.64]  I want the D.
[144.64 --> 148.52]  From what I can see so far, just like the head peeking out, I want the D.
[149.26 --> 149.70]  Wow.
[151.04 --> 151.48]  I can't.
[151.54 --> 152.72]  That's the picture they've launched.
[153.22 --> 155.70]  Okay, why don't you just go ahead and talk about our other topics?
[156.08 --> 159.36]  Scott Wasson will be live with us very soon, so we'll have him on the show.
[159.44 --> 160.26]  From the tech report?
[160.44 --> 161.02]  Yeah, man.
[161.22 --> 166.42]  Samsung will be creating 14 nanometer chips for AMD, which Scott Wasson will probably talk about.
[166.58 --> 167.62]  Yeah, I would think so.
[167.72 --> 171.66]  In fact, I think that's going to be a great topic for us to pick his brain about.
[171.66 --> 178.26]  Yep. Project R will have hot swap modules with a Google Play-like store where you'll be able to buy all their stuff super easily.
[178.26 --> 182.88]  And you'll even be able to probably swap out their battery without fully turning off your phone.
[182.94 --> 185.70]  Think of Project Aura, kind of like a multi-bit screwdriver.
[186.42 --> 190.72]  You see, I could have kept using this screwdriver while I swapped component.
[190.84 --> 191.66]  Well, okay, not quite.
[191.76 --> 192.68]  Okay, Project Aura?
[193.68 --> 194.94]  Better than a screwdriver.
[195.34 --> 196.62]  Better than a multi-bit screwdriver.
[197.70 --> 199.04]  Except when you need a screwdriver.
[199.26 --> 200.22]  Let's roll the stupid intro.
[200.22 --> 230.04]  All right, so we had no audio for the first part of this, and I'm supposed to be introducing our sponsors.
[230.04 --> 231.40]  We had no razors for today, so.
[231.78 --> 232.84]  No intro audio at all.
[232.98 --> 233.46]  No intro.
[233.64 --> 234.02]  Oh, what?
[234.08 --> 234.60]  No, I had it.
[235.14 --> 236.40]  Apparently, they didn't.
[236.68 --> 236.90]  Oh.
[237.50 --> 238.40]  I could hear them.
[238.58 --> 239.04]  That's weird.
[239.84 --> 240.80]  Well, at any rate.
[241.16 --> 242.00]  Dollar Shave Club.
[242.54 --> 244.90]  Save time, shave money with Dollar Shave Club.
[245.16 --> 252.54]  You get high-quality razors delivered directly to your door, and later on in the show, I'll tell you more about it if you don't already know how amazing it is.
[252.54 --> 252.94]  Shapers.
[252.94 --> 254.16]  Also, Squarespace.
[254.56 --> 262.26]  The fast, easy, cost-effective, and I guess easy is really the big one way to make your own beautiful website.
[262.46 --> 270.28]  Whether it's a blog or a portfolio or a store, they're adding more functionality all the time, always making it easier to use.
[270.62 --> 272.92]  And you can get 10% off with offer code Linus.
[272.92 --> 277.70]  So, big thanks to Dollar Shave Club and Squarespace for sponsoring today's show.
[277.90 --> 278.48]  Look at this.
[278.54 --> 279.88]  Look how fast I can move them around.
[280.26 --> 281.06]  Oh, my God.
[281.08 --> 281.94]  I can dance all day.
[282.00 --> 282.80]  I can dance all day.
[282.86 --> 283.62]  Look at my sponsors.
[283.80 --> 284.20]  Sponsors.
[284.26 --> 285.56]  Anyway, let's go back to us talking.
[285.56 --> 287.62]  So, apparently, they did have audio, and people were just being trolls.
[289.40 --> 290.48]  Twitch chat.
[292.06 --> 292.42]  Horrible.
[292.42 --> 292.90]  All right.
[293.00 --> 301.42]  So, guys, we're not going to waste too much time because we told Scott he was going to be joining us at around 5 o'clock, and it is now 5 o'clock.
[301.50 --> 305.26]  That was supposed to be half an hour into the show, but the show just started.
[305.72 --> 308.86]  So, Scott, you're live.
[309.00 --> 310.26]  Welcome to the show.
[310.44 --> 315.80]  Want to do a quick introduction to who exactly this Scott guy is and why he's on their screens?
[317.70 --> 320.50]  So, am I giving the introduction or are you giving the introduction?
[320.50 --> 322.10]  I will introduce you.
[322.10 --> 322.50]  Okay.
[322.68 --> 329.02]  So, Scott is basically like a gray hair of the industry, you know?
[329.68 --> 329.80]  Yeah.
[329.88 --> 330.32]  Many gray hair.
[330.32 --> 334.40]  I would have called him a gray beard, but I don't think he can grow a beard any more than I can.
[335.12 --> 335.96]  It's not good.
[336.22 --> 336.38]  Yeah.
[338.22 --> 344.04]  So, guys, Scott is one of the most respected tech reviewers, tech writers in the industry.
[344.20 --> 347.28]  He's been doing it a long time, like a really long time.
[347.36 --> 347.82]  Sorry, Scott.
[347.88 --> 348.96]  I'll stop with the old stuff.
[349.48 --> 351.20]  But he's been doing it a long time.
[351.20 --> 352.20]  You're not wrong.
[354.48 --> 356.02]  He's extremely experienced.
[356.44 --> 361.66]  And basically, if you wanted to get on, you know, a video call with someone and kind of, you know,
[361.74 --> 363.64]  hey, can you talk technical to me?
[364.22 --> 365.12]  You know, that kind of thing.
[365.34 --> 367.56]  You would want Scott on your Skype.
[367.56 --> 370.08]  So, we're going to hit some pretty hard tech topics.
[370.62 --> 374.52]  And you guys can find him over at thetechreport.com.
[374.62 --> 378.22]  They have lots of great articles about, I think, Furbies.
[378.22 --> 384.06]  See, right when you said it fur, I thought you were going with, like, fur me.
[384.46 --> 385.62]  And I was like, that's a little old.
[385.72 --> 387.60]  So, I thought you were going in with the old jokes again.
[387.64 --> 389.04]  I was like, that's not that old, though.
[389.20 --> 389.34]  Yeah.
[389.72 --> 391.62]  It's like, I don't know.
[391.88 --> 392.14]  Nope.
[392.26 --> 392.58]  Furby.
[392.58 --> 394.50]  3DFX SLI coverage.
[395.00 --> 397.52]  Like a GeForce 4 review if you want to read it.
[398.00 --> 398.54]  There you go.
[399.16 --> 399.84]  There you go.
[400.26 --> 402.72]  See, GeForce 4, to give you some idea.
[402.86 --> 409.08]  So, back in the GeForce 4 days, I was still looking at, like, the local computer paper.
[409.28 --> 409.50]  Yep.
[409.50 --> 413.98]  And trying to figure out what an AGP was.
[416.68 --> 418.74]  And you were reviewing graphics cards.
[418.90 --> 426.40]  So, Scott, why don't we kick things off with actually something that we didn't really put in your guest section, as far as I know.
[426.48 --> 427.40]  Have you heard the rumor?
[427.54 --> 428.62]  Have you heard the news?
[429.14 --> 429.94]  Sort of news.
[430.04 --> 430.48]  We're not sure.
[430.58 --> 431.40]  Rumor right now.
[431.40 --> 436.10]  About AMD potentially partnering with Samsung to produce 14 nanometer chips.
[436.76 --> 437.00]  Yes.
[437.00 --> 444.08]  Yeah, and, you know, we wrote a story about this, and we asked AMD to comment, and I don't think they got back to us.
[445.08 --> 448.80]  So, I'm not sure it's confirmed, but it makes sense for a couple reasons.
[450.08 --> 457.88]  You know, AMD gets a lot of chips made at its own former fabs, run now by a company called Global Foundries.
[458.42 --> 458.62]  Yeah.
[458.62 --> 466.90]  And Glofo, as I like to call them, and they don't like that, but they've had some trouble getting to the next process node.
[467.00 --> 468.06]  Shrinking their chips down.
[468.66 --> 472.20]  And they are part of a common platform alliance.
[472.30 --> 474.98]  They share technology with IBM and Samsung.
[475.72 --> 480.60]  And so, these guys kind of work together to make things go.
[480.74 --> 482.80]  And an unusual thing happened earlier this year.
[484.58 --> 489.76]  Glofo licensed Samsung's 14 nanometer process from them.
[489.76 --> 494.70]  And we think that probably, I think probably AMD was kind of behind that.
[494.70 --> 502.58]  They didn't like Glofo's progress toward getting to that node, and Samsung had made it or gotten close.
[503.64 --> 506.46]  And so, there was a sort of a technology transfer.
[506.78 --> 510.26]  But now it sounds like maybe Samsung's going to just make chips directly for AMD.
[510.26 --> 513.94]  So, here's kind of an interesting thing.
[514.02 --> 526.58]  This would be the first time in, even as long as you've been covering tech, that someone might potentially be at the same level as Intel for an extended period of time.
[526.70 --> 531.20]  I mean, Intel's, they're not that close to, or wait, excuse me.
[531.28 --> 533.56]  So, they're on 14 now.
[533.56 --> 536.42]  But they're not that close to 10, are they?
[536.50 --> 541.34]  Like, we just heard about them announcing a 10 nanometer fab that they're building in.
[541.34 --> 541.96]  Like a $6 billion project.
[541.98 --> 542.82]  Yeah, in Israel.
[543.24 --> 549.78]  But that means that AMD, Apple, Samsung could all be on the same process node as Intel for a little while here.
[550.84 --> 556.22]  Well, it's, yeah, the hard part about that is that the other guys are still talking about 14.
[556.36 --> 559.26]  And Intel has been shipping 14 in volume for a couple months.
[559.26 --> 565.10]  And so, that, talking about it and getting there are different things.
[565.16 --> 568.24]  I think Samsung has done some test chips and things like that.
[568.26 --> 570.10]  I'm not completely up on the status of that.
[570.28 --> 574.24]  But my sense is they're not yet shipping 14 nanometer stuff in volume.
[574.88 --> 579.00]  At least not the types of chips that we're talking about them building for AMD.
[579.90 --> 584.68]  So, yeah, it would be nice to think that everybody could catch up with Intel.
[585.12 --> 587.12]  But, I don't know.
[587.12 --> 588.98]  It hasn't happened for a long time.
[589.52 --> 592.22]  And everybody's roadmap always says they're going to.
[592.70 --> 594.12]  And then they never do it.
[594.66 --> 596.54]  When was the last time?
[596.76 --> 597.92]  You might remember this.
[599.40 --> 599.84]  Wow.
[600.04 --> 600.90]  I don't know.
[601.04 --> 602.88]  Like, somewhere around 90 nanometers, maybe?
[603.74 --> 604.04]  Right.
[604.14 --> 606.70]  So, that was back in, what, Prescott days?
[607.20 --> 607.42]  Yeah.
[607.50 --> 611.02]  I mean, you remember the Intel Pentium 4 stuff wasn't great.
[611.02 --> 615.04]  And their 90 nanometer process was somewhat leaky.
[615.28 --> 616.72]  So, it consumed a lot of power.
[617.02 --> 619.02]  They had a chip architecture problem, too.
[619.14 --> 620.78]  But they had a lot of problems at the same time.
[620.96 --> 622.34]  And manufacturing was one of them.
[622.84 --> 629.12]  AMD had some goodness going on with copper interconnects and silicon on insulator and things like that.
[629.12 --> 640.82]  And so, there was a time there when it wasn't entirely clear like it has been for the past four or five years that Intel was in the league compared to everybody else.
[640.94 --> 641.04]  Right.
[641.04 --> 653.40]  So, speaking of the kinds of chips that AMD would want someone like Samsung to build at 14 nanometer, there's rumors afoot of a new FX replacement.
[653.64 --> 661.30]  Finally, a legitimate high-performance chip from AMD to replace the aging FX lineup.
[661.56 --> 663.60]  So, is that what we're looking at here?
[663.74 --> 666.14]  And if so, any idea when?
[666.32 --> 666.72]  What do you think?
[666.72 --> 670.84]  Well, I think the rumors are about APUs or SOCs.
[671.22 --> 677.40]  And if you look at the time frame involved, it's got to be 2015, right?
[678.22 --> 684.80]  So, if it's 2015, I'm not sure if that's soon enough for AMD to have a new core out.
[684.92 --> 686.28]  But we know they have one in development.
[686.52 --> 688.58]  The ARM version of it is called the K12.
[688.92 --> 690.74]  And the x86 is, I think, called Xen.
[690.74 --> 706.12]  And that's a new big core that my sense is that AMD is going to try to build something that will compete with the Haswells and Skylakes and whatever Intel has out by the time it ships a product.
[706.52 --> 709.14]  I think we may be looking at 2016 for that core.
[709.14 --> 715.66]  But I expect that when that core is ready, it will go into APUs and SOCs.
[716.16 --> 728.32]  And so, if Samsung's making them, then you could have, assuming that Samsung does a good job at 14 nanometers, you could have a nice convergence of Samsung's process tech with the new CPU architecture from AMD.
[728.32 --> 730.46]  So, tell me something.
[730.60 --> 737.56]  I mean, we've seen, so, just a brief explanation for the viewers of how the cost structure of a CPU actually works.
[737.98 --> 743.70]  It's all about how much, how many dyes you're going to get out of a wafer.
[743.90 --> 746.42]  So, wafers are pretty much an industry standard size.
[746.42 --> 763.16]  And if you build a CPU that maybe you put mountain loads of cache on and you put a ton of cores in it and you make one that's really big, ultimately, you have to buy a lot of these wafers in order to end up with X number of dyes out of that wafer.
[763.36 --> 767.56]  Out of which some of them will be good and some of them will be corrupted and won't be usable.
[767.76 --> 769.18]  Some of them will be partially usable.
[769.58 --> 773.00]  So, maybe they'll have less cache or they'll be clocked lower or whatever else the case may be.
[773.00 --> 773.84]  More skews out of those.
[773.84 --> 786.20]  So, the way that processor manufacturers optimize for cost is they try to shrink all aspects of the chip so that they can fit more chips onto a wafer.
[786.76 --> 797.52]  So, AMD, by being a process node or even two behind Intel, is at a huge disadvantage because they get far fewer chips out of these wafers.
[797.62 --> 799.68]  So, their costs are inherently much higher.
[799.68 --> 813.00]  If they reached process node parity and AMD was willing to take the kinds of margins that they've been taking on their CPUs for quite some time, Scott, do you think they could build a CPU?
[813.20 --> 814.44]  Let's say not an APU.
[814.56 --> 820.04]  Let's say an FX CPU because we've seen Intel spending so much of their die space on graphics.
[820.04 --> 832.08]  If AMD built a CPU at the same process node as Intel and crammed that much more logic into it, could we see a legitimate leap forward in CPU performance the likes of which we haven't seen in four or five years?
[832.08 --> 862.06]  That would be nice.
[862.08 --> 863.08]  Yeah.
[863.08 --> 864.08]  Right.
[864.08 --> 873.04]  If it costs them $60 to make a chip and they sell it for $200 and it costs Intel $40 to make the same chip they sell for $200, it's still not bad business to be in.
[873.04 --> 873.30]  Yeah.
[873.30 --> 873.80]  Right.
[873.80 --> 876.94]  And the thing is that, and that goes up too, right?
[877.02 --> 879.52]  With Opterons and things like that, it can be thousands of dollars.
[879.90 --> 880.06]  Right.
[880.06 --> 889.06]  And I remember one time I was talking with, quizzing a guy with AMD about this, about, you know, but you're behind on process node and, you know, those are really big chips.
[889.06 --> 895.32]  And one time they were taking two Opterons and putting them in the same socket on one substrate, you know.
[895.70 --> 898.64]  And I said, that's, you know, that's really costly, isn't it?
[898.64 --> 906.58]  And he said, yes, maybe, but every one of those Opterons that we sell for $1,200 is good business for AMD.
[907.08 --> 907.30]  Yeah.
[907.38 --> 916.42]  And so I think the key for AMD is to be able to offer a product that is a credible alternative to Intel that has attractive performance and power consumption.
[916.42 --> 923.94]  And they don't have to win to be winning people's business and making money.
[925.00 --> 926.14]  But they need to better than they are.
[926.14 --> 926.92]  Yeah, but AMD hasn't been doing exactly amazing.
[926.92 --> 928.50]  And I think that's the hope with the new core.
[930.52 --> 931.06]  Go ahead.
[931.44 --> 934.62]  AMD hasn't been doing exactly amazing with those profit margins there.
[934.76 --> 938.08]  Not even that long ago, they were doing seriously not great.
[938.22 --> 941.26]  And then with the new console launch, things have been turning up a little bit.
[941.26 --> 947.50]  So I do agree with you, that is probably true, but it couldn't help getting onto a lower node and having more.
[947.52 --> 948.24]  You mean it couldn't hurt.
[949.02 --> 949.88]  It couldn't hurt.
[949.96 --> 950.54]  There we go.
[950.66 --> 951.94]  Couldn't possibly help them.
[952.42 --> 952.68]  Right.
[952.84 --> 955.32]  It's always good if you can get to a new process node.
[955.32 --> 959.92]  And one thing that AMD kind of had to take a hit when they made their last transition,
[960.32 --> 966.90]  because they went from a 32 nanometer process node designed for CPUs on the last generation,
[967.16 --> 970.22]  to when they brought out Kaveri, they went to a 28 nanometer process node
[970.22 --> 974.12]  that's really more tuned for low power, high density GPU type applications.
[974.66 --> 979.10]  And as a result, they got less clock speed on the CPU portion of their APU
[979.10 --> 980.66]  than they had in the prior generation.
[981.72 --> 988.34]  And really what you want is you want a process tech that will give you all the benefits
[988.34 --> 993.34]  that you can get out of better process tech, including faster switching speeds
[993.34 --> 994.52]  so you can get to higher clocks.
[994.52 --> 999.92]  And I think with Samsung going to 14 nanometers and going to FinFETs,
[1000.08 --> 1004.66]  or Intel calls them tri-gate transistors, that there's a good possibility
[1004.66 --> 1009.78]  that there could be a nice increase in switching speed at higher power levels,
[1009.96 --> 1013.36]  which could translate into performance as well.
[1013.78 --> 1018.22]  But honestly, I think architecture is their biggest need right now.
[1018.22 --> 1019.98]  I don't think it's process tech.
[1020.56 --> 1022.88]  Process tech is always something you have to be on top of,
[1023.10 --> 1026.64]  but there are multiple options, different foundries they can go to,
[1026.94 --> 1028.96]  and they're exercising that by going to Samsung.
[1029.36 --> 1033.14]  But what they need is a good architecture to go along with it.
[1034.30 --> 1035.68]  Well, I hope we see that.
[1035.84 --> 1040.54]  I would love to see someone build a balls-to-the-wall CPU again.
[1040.54 --> 1045.16]  The 5960X isn't enough for you?
[1045.84 --> 1048.88]  Okay, the 5960X is pretty cool.
[1050.72 --> 1053.16]  Okay, yes, the 5960X is pretty cool.
[1053.20 --> 1055.14]  I'd like to see two of them fighting it out, though, right?
[1055.46 --> 1055.94]  I mean...
[1055.94 --> 1058.56]  Yes, I'd like to see it not $1,000 there.
[1058.96 --> 1059.18]  Yeah, yeah.
[1059.24 --> 1059.40]  Right.
[1060.28 --> 1060.58]  Right.
[1061.72 --> 1064.24]  You'd like to see that on the consumer platform
[1064.24 --> 1067.08]  and have something even more badass on the enthusiast platform as well.
[1067.08 --> 1067.84]  Right.
[1068.24 --> 1073.76]  Well, like Intel did, it's the eDRAM external cache, L4 cache,
[1073.98 --> 1077.62]  on some chips that it sells, and it's faster for graphics that way,
[1077.88 --> 1080.98]  but you can't buy that in a desktop chip that's socketed.
[1081.60 --> 1083.24]  You know, that's the type of thing that...
[1083.24 --> 1088.18]  It's not a huge performance win on the desktop, but it's really cool.
[1088.72 --> 1090.76]  And Intel doesn't bring it to the desktop
[1090.76 --> 1092.38]  because they don't have any competition there.
[1092.78 --> 1094.82]  That's the type of thing that gets pulled into the desktop
[1094.82 --> 1096.52]  because it's cool technology,
[1096.98 --> 1100.44]  and if they're fighting it out with a strong competitor.
[1101.12 --> 1103.58]  Yeah, and I mean, I love Intel and NVIDIA as much as anyone,
[1103.78 --> 1107.44]  but I think that we've seen enough times throughout history,
[1107.56 --> 1110.04]  even as long as I've been paying attention to this stuff,
[1110.36 --> 1113.42]  they're pretty content to sit and wait for AMD to make a move
[1113.42 --> 1117.18]  before they drop price or before they release something more competitive
[1117.18 --> 1118.44]  or whatever the case may be.
[1118.64 --> 1118.76]  Yeah.
[1118.76 --> 1119.40]  Yeah.
[1119.40 --> 1119.54]  Yeah.
[1119.74 --> 1122.56]  Well, like Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge has well.
[1122.72 --> 1125.26]  You know, for like a year after they were released,
[1125.40 --> 1127.62]  they kept the exact same price.
[1127.94 --> 1130.68]  And it used to be like every three months you've got a price cut.
[1131.08 --> 1131.30]  Yep.
[1131.84 --> 1132.02]  Yeah.
[1132.22 --> 1133.00]  That was cool.
[1133.50 --> 1135.22]  There was always something to talk about, you know?
[1136.50 --> 1136.84]  Yeah.
[1136.98 --> 1140.28]  It's a lot more exciting when there's two competitors instead of one.
[1140.28 --> 1143.78]  The pricing has been a little bit nuts since Maxwell dropped.
[1144.50 --> 1148.52]  I've seen 780 Ti's like $100 or $200 below 980s
[1148.52 --> 1151.44]  just because so many people are glomming on 980s, stuff like that.
[1151.54 --> 1153.74]  Speaking of people glomming on to 980s,
[1153.74 --> 1159.42]  I had a chat with someone at an undisclosed retailer,
[1159.76 --> 1164.96]  and they let me know that the GTX 970 Strix, the Asus card,
[1165.04 --> 1166.18]  you reviewed that one, right, Scott?
[1166.62 --> 1166.84]  Yeah.
[1166.84 --> 1174.26]  Yeah, so they have 300 back orders on that one SKU.
[1174.88 --> 1175.18]  Wow.
[1175.52 --> 1179.48]  Yeah, they were telling me they've never seen anything like this since 8800 GT.
[1180.30 --> 1180.64]  Wow.
[1181.70 --> 1182.58]  I believe it.
[1182.70 --> 1183.52]  I mean, it makes sense.
[1183.76 --> 1187.18]  We haven't had this type of combination of there's a lot more performance
[1187.18 --> 1189.50]  at a really nice price for a long time.
[1190.02 --> 1190.16]  Yeah.
[1190.26 --> 1192.92]  You know what's funny is, again, undisclosed,
[1192.92 --> 1194.06]  not going to say who it was,
[1194.06 --> 1197.60]  but I talked to someone at NVIDIA prior to the launch
[1197.60 --> 1200.42]  when I was having the prices given to me
[1200.42 --> 1202.72]  so that I could make my video.
[1203.38 --> 1205.12]  Very last minute, that whole thing.
[1205.32 --> 1206.74]  But that's neither here nor there.
[1207.12 --> 1208.56]  So they told me the prices,
[1208.96 --> 1209.90]  and I kind of went,
[1210.12 --> 1213.04]  wow, well, GTX 970 is the disruptive one.
[1213.74 --> 1214.60]  And he's kind of like,
[1215.06 --> 1215.60]  what do you mean?
[1215.86 --> 1218.18]  The 980 is going to have the performance crown.
[1218.18 --> 1219.54]  And I kind of went, well, yeah,
[1219.62 --> 1222.60]  but the 970 is only cut down by, what, 20%?
[1223.26 --> 1225.76]  And it's going to overclock like a bat out of hell.
[1226.00 --> 1226.22]  Yeah.
[1226.54 --> 1229.02]  And it's like almost $200 cheaper.
[1229.30 --> 1230.80]  What a fantastic card.
[1231.04 --> 1233.10]  And he kind of goes, oh, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[1233.16 --> 1234.64]  I guess you mean disruptive in that way.
[1236.64 --> 1237.36]  Oh, my goodness.
[1237.36 --> 1238.62]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[1238.70 --> 1241.28]  They focus on the performance crown at these companies a lot,
[1241.28 --> 1244.50]  and that's not always what people want to buy, you know?
[1245.06 --> 1245.92]  They want to sell you.
[1246.82 --> 1249.72]  Because you can get certain cars that are better than 980,
[1249.88 --> 1253.10]  but 980 is at a really good price for what it is,
[1253.14 --> 1253.96]  so people are buying it.
[1254.02 --> 1256.54]  And then 970 is at an even better price for what it is,
[1256.76 --> 1258.00]  so more people are buying that.
[1259.06 --> 1259.64]  It's pretty interesting.
[1260.70 --> 1261.92]  So, go ahead.
[1264.22 --> 1265.28]  Everyone's way too polite.
[1265.64 --> 1266.04]  I know.
[1266.30 --> 1267.90]  Okay, I'm just going to talk over everyone from now on.
[1267.90 --> 1269.90]  Okay, so 980 and 970.
[1269.90 --> 1273.34]  970, you had uncovered a little while ago,
[1273.40 --> 1276.70]  we thought that the only real difference between 980 and 970
[1276.70 --> 1280.88]  was how many SMs that they had,
[1281.18 --> 1285.02]  but you had found a bit of a disparity in their performance
[1285.02 --> 1286.84]  that you couldn't really explain up till now.
[1287.20 --> 1293.56]  So, can you maybe talk about what people should choose for 4K gaming?
[1293.66 --> 1295.94]  Because I've gotten a lot of questions about this
[1295.94 --> 1298.74]  in the comments on our 980 performance overview,
[1298.74 --> 1300.36]  in PMs on the forum,
[1300.48 --> 1302.14]  in threads I've seen posted on the forum.
[1302.46 --> 1304.34]  Is 970 okay for 4K?
[1306.02 --> 1307.66]  You know, that's a tough question,
[1307.76 --> 1311.52]  because is 980 okay for 4K?
[1311.58 --> 1312.10]  I was going to say,
[1312.30 --> 1315.80]  is it okay for 4K is kind of an interesting question right now.
[1315.80 --> 1318.08]  I mean, I kind of think you want to.
[1319.22 --> 1320.62]  For running everything,
[1320.78 --> 1324.70]  like the high-end games that we use for testing at high quality settings,
[1325.66 --> 1330.28]  one of anything that's out there right now isn't entirely adequate.
[1330.28 --> 1336.06]  You can play some games and you can tweak things to where a 970 or a 980 will run in 4K,
[1336.26 --> 1338.44]  but it's not always a great experience.
[1339.54 --> 1344.50]  So, it's weird because there is this architectural difference
[1344.50 --> 1347.42]  that we didn't understand before between the 970 and the 980,
[1347.42 --> 1349.76]  in that the 980 has,
[1349.88 --> 1352.26]  both of them have the same number of ROPs,
[1352.34 --> 1353.54]  which determines pixel throughput,
[1353.86 --> 1355.66]  and that's really important for 4K,
[1356.24 --> 1358.18]  because you've got a lot of pixels.
[1359.04 --> 1363.26]  But it turns out that when you cut the number of SMs,
[1363.26 --> 1364.56]  like they do on the 970,
[1364.80 --> 1368.06]  you actually lower the pixel throughput of the card effectively,
[1368.38 --> 1371.86]  because the SMs help determine the pixel throughput
[1371.86 --> 1376.42]  in a way that we didn't understand until after our 980 review,
[1376.52 --> 1378.54]  when a fellow reviewer, Damien at hardware.fr,
[1379.10 --> 1380.30]  sent me a little note and said,
[1380.64 --> 1382.54]  hey, see that benchmark result you got
[1382.54 --> 1384.90]  where it was a lot lower fill rate on the 970?
[1385.46 --> 1386.54]  Yeah, here's the explanation.
[1386.72 --> 1388.82]  I did a little post about it, but it's totally his work.
[1388.82 --> 1393.42]  He figured out by asking very specific questions of NVIDIA,
[1393.98 --> 1397.50]  you know, why there was actually less capacity
[1397.50 --> 1400.00]  for pixel throughput on the 970.
[1400.00 --> 1402.98]  That said, you know, I've been playing around
[1402.98 --> 1405.98]  with overclocking 980s and 970s a little bit,
[1406.22 --> 1409.30]  and, you know, you can get back a lot of what you lose
[1409.30 --> 1412.44]  by taking your SMs away, by turning up clock speeds.
[1412.98 --> 1415.28]  And what else I've got right over here
[1415.28 --> 1419.62]  is a 4K monitor from Acer that is G-Sync capable.
[1420.42 --> 1424.68]  And I'm finding out that even though in a lot of cases
[1424.68 --> 1426.62]  frame rates seem a little bit marginal
[1426.62 --> 1430.06]  on a 970 or a 980 with a single card,
[1430.34 --> 1432.92]  that when you have G-Sync and you're in those situations
[1432.92 --> 1435.38]  where it's like, you know, 40 some FPS,
[1436.36 --> 1438.02]  sometimes that's good enough
[1438.02 --> 1440.82]  when the monitor is updating right when a frame is ready.
[1440.96 --> 1442.50]  So I'll tell you this.
[1442.60 --> 1447.62]  I actually did my Acer 4K G-Sync video
[1448.38 --> 1451.62]  really differently from how I've typically looked
[1451.62 --> 1454.84]  at either monitors or video cards
[1454.84 --> 1456.56]  from a performance perspective before.
[1456.78 --> 1458.44]  I did it, no numbers,
[1458.60 --> 1461.04]  because we lack the high-speed camera equipment
[1461.04 --> 1465.08]  that we would need to properly quantify G-Sync
[1465.08 --> 1466.78]  in a way that would be meaningful to viewers.
[1467.44 --> 1470.82]  And FCAT's not working for it.
[1471.28 --> 1473.80]  And basically the thing about G-Sync
[1473.80 --> 1477.34]  is it's more of a feel than a number right now
[1477.34 --> 1479.40]  in terms of the equipment that we have to test it
[1479.40 --> 1480.32]  on our side anyway.
[1480.94 --> 1485.24]  So the way I did it was instead of having fraps on
[1485.24 --> 1487.00]  and tuning my game settings
[1487.00 --> 1489.60]  so that it was running at solid FPS
[1489.60 --> 1490.46]  and I knew that,
[1490.92 --> 1493.54]  I sat down and I cranked the detail on my games
[1493.54 --> 1495.64]  without any FPS counter
[1495.64 --> 1498.00]  and then I reduced it
[1498.00 --> 1501.06]  until it felt like I was playing at 60 FPS smooth.
[1501.26 --> 1503.52]  Then I alt-tabbed out, fired up fraps
[1503.52 --> 1504.74]  and had a look at my frame rates.
[1505.06 --> 1507.20]  And I discovered the exact same thing that you did.
[1507.20 --> 1509.84]  I was getting dips down to 42, 43
[1509.84 --> 1512.88]  and that felt butter smooth to me.
[1513.46 --> 1513.56]  Yeah.
[1513.94 --> 1515.32]  And G-Sync is great for that.
[1515.94 --> 1517.54]  So I don't know,
[1517.64 --> 1521.02]  that's kind of a tough decision in terms of pricing
[1521.02 --> 1523.70]  because those 4K G-Sync monitors are not cheap, right?
[1524.16 --> 1525.68]  Yeah, well, there's one model.
[1525.98 --> 1527.44]  So speaking of two competitors
[1527.44 --> 1530.12]  being better for excitement and pricing.
[1530.44 --> 1530.68]  Yeah.
[1531.84 --> 1532.36]  Yeah.
[1532.86 --> 1534.42]  Asus is the only show in town.
[1535.18 --> 1535.36]  Yeah.
[1535.36 --> 1538.36]  I think Asus is supposed to have a 4K G-Sync monitor
[1538.36 --> 1539.64]  out before the end of the year, though.
[1540.24 --> 1540.58]  Okay.
[1540.74 --> 1542.64]  So sometime in the next three months.
[1542.98 --> 1543.68]  So we'll see.
[1544.70 --> 1547.18]  But even not 4K G-Sync monitors
[1547.18 --> 1548.64]  can be extremely expensive still.
[1548.84 --> 1549.06]  Yep.
[1549.18 --> 1551.14]  We do need to see a little bit more market flooding
[1551.14 --> 1553.30]  until it's going to be conceivable
[1553.30 --> 1554.26]  for a lot of different people.
[1554.32 --> 1554.58]  Okay.
[1554.74 --> 1555.10]  So Scott...
[1555.72 --> 1556.20]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1556.62 --> 1558.06]  Well, G-Sync's awesome technology,
[1558.20 --> 1559.48]  but it's not a good deal right now.
[1559.48 --> 1563.38]  So speaking of not a good deal right now,
[1563.56 --> 1564.86]  it's kind of...
[1564.86 --> 1567.24]  There's so much confusion right now
[1567.24 --> 1569.50]  about AMD's project FreeSync.
[1569.94 --> 1570.12]  Yeah.
[1570.20 --> 1571.62]  Maybe you can clarify this
[1571.62 --> 1572.42]  because honestly,
[1572.56 --> 1575.06]  I've even found myself getting a little bit lost
[1575.06 --> 1576.54]  in the misinformation about it.
[1576.64 --> 1578.24]  So there's a lot of people saying,
[1578.38 --> 1581.18]  okay, it's built into DisplayPort now.
[1581.34 --> 1583.06]  We're just going to see it built into
[1583.06 --> 1584.68]  the next generation scalers,
[1584.84 --> 1585.98]  and we're going to have support
[1585.98 --> 1587.36]  for FreeSync across the board.
[1587.50 --> 1589.14]  Then there's other information out there,
[1589.24 --> 1590.98]  some of which is coming from AMD themselves,
[1591.32 --> 1592.66]  saying, well, actually, hold on a second.
[1592.74 --> 1595.52]  It's only a small subset of our graphics cards
[1595.52 --> 1597.16]  that are actually going to support the tech,
[1597.56 --> 1599.66]  and it's not necessarily
[1599.66 --> 1601.40]  just going to be part of DisplayPort.
[1601.88 --> 1603.60]  And NVIDIA's coming out saying,
[1603.72 --> 1605.02]  yeah, we're not going to support it.
[1605.06 --> 1606.40]  It's not just part of DisplayPort.
[1606.40 --> 1608.52]  What the hell is FreeSync?
[1609.54 --> 1612.32]  Well, FreeSync is AMD's project
[1612.32 --> 1614.22]  to create a variable refresh monitor.
[1614.96 --> 1618.14]  And there's a VASIS spec called Adaptive Sync,
[1618.54 --> 1620.30]  Adaptive Dash Sync, I think,
[1620.68 --> 1624.50]  that is something that AMD kind of shepherded through
[1624.50 --> 1626.38]  as an extension to DisplayPort
[1626.38 --> 1628.66]  in order to enable Project FreeSync.
[1629.60 --> 1632.48]  I don't think it's a mandatory part of the spec,
[1632.90 --> 1634.02]  but it's an extension.
[1634.68 --> 1636.12]  It may be mandatory eventually,
[1636.12 --> 1639.06]  but that doesn't mean that a monitor
[1639.06 --> 1640.86]  needs to have all of the capabilities
[1640.86 --> 1642.48]  to support variable refresh.
[1643.28 --> 1646.04]  AMD is working with monitor makers
[1646.04 --> 1648.20]  and with the scaler manufacturers
[1648.20 --> 1653.12]  to enable a variable refresh-capable
[1653.76 --> 1656.04]  set of hardware, set of displays,
[1656.36 --> 1658.92]  multiple products from different companies.
[1658.92 --> 1662.84]  And what we really haven't seen yet
[1662.84 --> 1665.36]  is a functioning prototype
[1665.36 --> 1667.38]  or anything like that.
[1667.88 --> 1669.28]  So if you remember,
[1669.48 --> 1672.58]  G-Sync was demoed in September 2013.
[1673.74 --> 1677.34]  I think we talked at that event, right?
[1677.52 --> 1677.68]  Yeah.
[1677.68 --> 1680.08]  And then NVIDIA said,
[1680.16 --> 1681.70]  oh, it'll be out in like March
[1681.70 --> 1684.04]  and then summer and fall.
[1684.04 --> 1684.94]  And it didn't come out
[1684.94 --> 1687.20]  until really the end of summer or fall.
[1687.46 --> 1687.82]  Yeah.
[1687.88 --> 1689.60]  I mean, I had plans with NVIDIA
[1689.60 --> 1694.24]  to potentially do like a wine tasting style event
[1694.24 --> 1695.28]  in Q1
[1695.28 --> 1698.46]  where they wanted monitors to be available
[1698.46 --> 1700.76]  and we were going to have members of our community
[1700.76 --> 1703.24]  come and do like a blind taste test type thing.
[1703.30 --> 1704.06]  That was going to be cool.
[1704.18 --> 1706.16]  And that was going to be like a super cool idea.
[1706.16 --> 1707.16]  And then...
[1708.16 --> 1710.42]  It just didn't really work.
[1711.10 --> 1711.30]  Yeah.
[1711.48 --> 1712.42]  Nothing ever happened
[1712.42 --> 1713.42]  because there was nothing.
[1714.44 --> 1714.72]  Yeah.
[1714.72 --> 1717.58]  So I think the first step
[1717.58 --> 1718.92]  or probably the next step,
[1719.00 --> 1719.42]  I hope,
[1719.56 --> 1721.84]  is that we get to see a working prototype.
[1722.94 --> 1725.24]  But AMD is saying that those are on the way
[1725.24 --> 1727.30]  and then they're saying early next year
[1727.30 --> 1728.94]  for the first products.
[1729.96 --> 1731.28]  And, you know,
[1731.60 --> 1733.50]  these are product schedules.
[1734.72 --> 1736.94]  That's the best case, I think,
[1736.96 --> 1737.64]  when you hear that.
[1737.78 --> 1738.60]  But it could happen.
[1739.02 --> 1739.16]  Right.
[1739.20 --> 1740.00]  And, you know,
[1740.02 --> 1741.00]  the other question is
[1741.00 --> 1743.68]  how much cost will it add to a monitor
[1743.68 --> 1745.00]  to support this feature
[1745.00 --> 1745.94]  and do it correctly?
[1746.10 --> 1746.28]  Yeah.
[1746.50 --> 1747.28]  And, you know,
[1747.38 --> 1748.88]  the path that NVIDIA has taken,
[1749.20 --> 1750.48]  they developed their own scaler
[1750.48 --> 1752.28]  completely from scratch
[1752.28 --> 1753.20]  as far as I can tell
[1753.20 --> 1755.78]  instead of working with the scaler manufacturer.
[1756.46 --> 1758.44]  AMD is much more collaborative here.
[1759.22 --> 1759.96]  So presumably,
[1760.58 --> 1760.76]  you know,
[1760.82 --> 1762.50]  those scaler guys already have built
[1762.50 --> 1763.92]  all the things that you find
[1763.92 --> 1765.32]  in a normal monitor scaler
[1765.32 --> 1766.84]  and they only have to add
[1766.84 --> 1768.28]  variable refresh capability.
[1768.64 --> 1768.74]  Right.
[1768.80 --> 1769.44]  And presumably,
[1769.74 --> 1771.84]  they might be able to do things,
[1772.00 --> 1773.30]  you know,
[1773.30 --> 1774.08]  reasonably well,
[1774.20 --> 1774.92]  reasonably quickly
[1774.92 --> 1775.86]  without too much trouble.
[1776.16 --> 1776.86]  The other thing is
[1776.86 --> 1778.74]  NVIDIA's hardware is built off
[1778.74 --> 1780.54]  of what's called the FPGA,
[1781.06 --> 1782.48]  Field Programmable Gate Array,
[1782.62 --> 1784.80]  which is an expensive chip
[1784.80 --> 1785.88]  that you can program
[1785.88 --> 1786.80]  to do almost anything.
[1787.28 --> 1787.92]  And that's usually
[1787.92 --> 1788.98]  what you use in development.
[1789.48 --> 1789.52]  Right.
[1789.52 --> 1790.08]  But then you make
[1790.08 --> 1790.88]  a custom chip
[1790.88 --> 1792.04]  or an ASIC
[1792.04 --> 1793.04]  that actually,
[1793.18 --> 1793.70]  like,
[1793.96 --> 1795.34]  does this function
[1795.34 --> 1797.02]  and it's much lower cost.
[1797.62 --> 1798.90]  And I think
[1798.90 --> 1800.24]  that probably the products
[1800.24 --> 1800.90]  that come to market
[1800.90 --> 1802.28]  from the scaler manufacturers
[1802.28 --> 1803.72]  are,
[1804.06 --> 1804.96]  I don't know for sure,
[1805.04 --> 1805.82]  but I'd expect them
[1805.82 --> 1806.60]  to be ASICs.
[1806.76 --> 1807.64]  And if they're not
[1807.64 --> 1808.96]  in the first generation,
[1809.10 --> 1810.20]  eventually they should be.
[1810.62 --> 1811.16]  Because I think
[1811.16 --> 1812.04]  what everybody wants
[1812.04 --> 1814.28]  is for the cost premium
[1814.28 --> 1816.20]  to go down.
[1816.36 --> 1817.18]  50 bucks.
[1817.18 --> 1817.50]  And that needs to happen
[1817.50 --> 1818.78]  because of more competition.
[1818.96 --> 1819.40]  It needs to happen
[1819.40 --> 1820.42]  because they use
[1820.42 --> 1821.10]  cheaper hardware.
[1821.34 --> 1822.26]  And it needs to happen
[1822.26 --> 1824.30]  because there are more suppliers.
[1824.92 --> 1825.88]  50 bucks is,
[1825.92 --> 1826.88]  is in my mind,
[1826.88 --> 1828.72]  for a 24 inch monitor,
[1829.10 --> 1830.82]  what the adder needs to be
[1830.82 --> 1831.86]  in order for me
[1831.86 --> 1833.00]  to really tell people,
[1833.28 --> 1833.64]  guys,
[1834.48 --> 1836.04]  it officially doesn't make sense
[1836.04 --> 1836.80]  to buy a monitor
[1836.80 --> 1838.04]  without some kind of
[1838.04 --> 1839.16]  adaptive refresh rate.
[1839.36 --> 1840.00]  And I think people
[1840.00 --> 1840.58]  aren't going to mind
[1840.58 --> 1842.02]  waiting for FreeSync
[1842.02 --> 1842.48]  to come in
[1842.48 --> 1843.86]  because it's not 50 bucks
[1843.86 --> 1844.32]  right now.
[1844.46 --> 1845.52]  So it is a very hard
[1845.52 --> 1846.10]  decision to make.
[1846.14 --> 1846.54]  And a lot of people
[1846.54 --> 1847.30]  are going to keep monitors
[1847.30 --> 1848.28]  for a very long time.
[1848.38 --> 1849.42]  So making a monitor decision
[1849.42 --> 1850.64]  sometimes isn't that,
[1851.10 --> 1851.62]  oh sweet,
[1851.66 --> 1852.66]  a new graphics card came out,
[1852.72 --> 1853.30]  let me upgrade.
[1853.62 --> 1854.36]  It's more of a,
[1854.46 --> 1854.58]  okay,
[1854.60 --> 1855.74]  it's been six years,
[1855.74 --> 1856.44]  seven years.
[1856.54 --> 1857.32]  Maybe I should reset
[1857.32 --> 1858.02]  all my monitors.
[1858.80 --> 1859.04]  Yeah.
[1859.66 --> 1860.26]  And you know,
[1860.38 --> 1861.68]  I think what you want to see
[1861.68 --> 1863.56]  is for AMD to succeed
[1863.56 --> 1865.10]  and for their stuff
[1865.10 --> 1865.58]  to get out there
[1865.58 --> 1866.02]  in the market
[1866.02 --> 1867.36]  and then at some point
[1867.36 --> 1868.94]  for this
[1868.94 --> 1870.18]  to become ubiquitous.
[1870.30 --> 1870.96]  And what I mean by that
[1870.96 --> 1872.32]  is NVIDIA has to cave
[1872.32 --> 1872.64]  and say,
[1872.72 --> 1872.94]  okay,
[1872.94 --> 1873.94]  we're going to support it.
[1874.14 --> 1875.30]  If you buy this monitor,
[1875.62 --> 1875.86]  you can,
[1875.94 --> 1876.46]  you can do it
[1876.46 --> 1877.32]  but adaptive refresh
[1877.32 --> 1878.00]  with the Radeon
[1878.00 --> 1878.96]  on the G-Force.
[1879.12 --> 1880.06]  But I don't think NVIDIA
[1880.06 --> 1880.88]  has any interest
[1880.88 --> 1882.38]  in making that easy
[1882.38 --> 1882.96]  for AMD.
[1883.38 --> 1884.50]  So they're going to wait
[1884.50 --> 1886.02]  and take advantage
[1886.02 --> 1886.50]  of the fact
[1886.50 --> 1887.28]  that they're first
[1887.28 --> 1889.74]  because they built G-Sync
[1889.74 --> 1891.14]  and they did it first
[1891.14 --> 1891.66]  and they invested
[1891.66 --> 1892.68]  and they're going to wait
[1892.68 --> 1892.98]  and see.
[1893.24 --> 1893.86]  And the other thing
[1893.86 --> 1895.66]  that I'm not really clear on
[1895.66 --> 1897.06]  is if you look
[1897.06 --> 1898.16]  at that G-Sync module
[1898.16 --> 1899.98]  that NVIDIA built,
[1900.12 --> 1901.00]  it has a bunch of RAM
[1901.00 --> 1901.32]  on it
[1901.32 --> 1902.40]  as well as an FPGA.
[1902.84 --> 1903.04]  Yeah.
[1903.14 --> 1903.62]  It has a buffer.
[1904.26 --> 1905.42]  And I think it's
[1905.42 --> 1906.94]  like a look-aside buffer
[1906.94 --> 1908.34]  and they need it
[1908.34 --> 1909.02]  every once in a while
[1909.02 --> 1909.88]  when they don't get
[1909.88 --> 1910.52]  another frame
[1910.52 --> 1913.50]  from the GPU in time,
[1913.70 --> 1914.68]  they've got to refresh
[1914.68 --> 1915.22]  the display
[1915.22 --> 1916.22]  because it's time.
[1916.86 --> 1918.06]  So they have to store
[1918.06 --> 1919.52]  a frame in the buffer.
[1920.00 --> 1921.38]  And I don't know
[1921.38 --> 1922.28]  whether AMD
[1922.28 --> 1923.14]  will be able to come up
[1923.14 --> 1923.70]  with an approach
[1923.70 --> 1924.96]  where that memory
[1924.96 --> 1925.70]  is not required
[1925.70 --> 1926.74]  but the same functionality
[1926.74 --> 1927.66]  is available.
[1928.14 --> 1928.34]  Right.
[1929.22 --> 1930.12]  It might be
[1930.12 --> 1931.86]  because they did show
[1931.86 --> 1932.48]  variable refresh
[1932.48 --> 1933.40]  on a laptop display
[1933.40 --> 1934.18]  which is a little bit
[1934.18 --> 1935.22]  of a different type
[1935.22 --> 1936.66]  of setup
[1936.66 --> 1938.42]  at CES
[1938.42 --> 1939.22]  in the little demo
[1939.22 --> 1939.86]  they showed me.
[1940.42 --> 1942.28]  But whether or not
[1942.28 --> 1943.22]  they can pull that off
[1943.22 --> 1943.90]  is going to determine
[1943.90 --> 1944.64]  the cost too.
[1945.18 --> 1946.92]  And I'm still waiting
[1946.92 --> 1947.60]  to hear details.
[1950.10 --> 1951.36]  So do you think NVIDIA
[1951.36 --> 1951.96]  went with such
[1951.96 --> 1952.98]  an expensive solution
[1952.98 --> 1953.60]  just because they
[1953.60 --> 1954.12]  were in a hurry?
[1955.26 --> 1955.52]  Yeah.
[1955.76 --> 1956.14]  Definitely.
[1956.50 --> 1957.26]  And in fact,
[1957.60 --> 1959.36]  I would talk to Tom Peterson
[1959.36 --> 1960.18]  who's the engineer
[1960.18 --> 1960.70]  at NVIDIA
[1960.70 --> 1962.24]  who sort of spearheaded
[1962.24 --> 1963.04]  G-Sync
[1963.04 --> 1964.22]  and he said something
[1964.22 --> 1964.86]  interesting to me.
[1965.18 --> 1966.80]  Between the time
[1966.80 --> 1968.28]  in March or so
[1968.28 --> 1968.86]  when they were supposed
[1968.86 --> 1970.04]  to launch G-Sync
[1970.04 --> 1971.08]  and the time
[1971.08 --> 1971.50]  in the summer
[1971.50 --> 1972.48]  when it was really imminent
[1972.48 --> 1973.68]  I spoke with him
[1973.68 --> 1974.14]  and he said
[1974.14 --> 1975.56]  you know,
[1975.64 --> 1976.56]  we really had some problems
[1976.56 --> 1977.22]  we had to work out
[1977.22 --> 1977.66]  which is why
[1977.66 --> 1978.42]  we had the delay
[1978.42 --> 1980.10]  and thank goodness
[1980.10 --> 1981.50]  it was an FPGA
[1981.50 --> 1983.78]  because they had to change
[1983.78 --> 1984.44]  the way that it worked
[1984.44 --> 1984.86]  fundamentally
[1984.86 --> 1985.56]  and if it had been
[1985.56 --> 1986.26]  a custom chip
[1986.26 --> 1986.96]  they would have had to
[1986.96 --> 1988.22]  build another spin
[1988.22 --> 1988.74]  on the chip.
[1989.40 --> 1989.50]  Right.
[1990.04 --> 1990.70]  I think it also
[1990.70 --> 1991.50]  like,
[1991.66 --> 1992.44]  of course they wanted
[1992.44 --> 1992.72]  to hurry
[1992.72 --> 1993.28]  but I think it also
[1993.28 --> 1993.74]  comes into
[1993.74 --> 1994.92]  NVIDIA seems to like
[1994.92 --> 1996.08]  doing things by themselves
[1996.08 --> 1997.82]  in a fairly locked down
[1997.82 --> 1998.32]  ecosystem
[1998.32 --> 1999.64]  and AMD is that
[1999.64 --> 2000.16]  whole
[2000.16 --> 2001.78]  let's all come together
[2001.78 --> 2002.64]  and help everyone
[2002.64 --> 2003.46]  and we'll do it
[2003.46 --> 2004.82]  as one big unit
[2004.82 --> 2005.70]  and those are two
[2005.70 --> 2006.98]  extremely different styles
[2006.98 --> 2008.26]  and I fully understand
[2008.26 --> 2009.64]  the style that NVIDIA
[2009.64 --> 2010.06]  went with
[2010.06 --> 2011.30]  because it's their style
[2011.30 --> 2012.18]  it makes sense.
[2012.60 --> 2013.12]  Yeah, they do tend
[2013.12 --> 2013.88]  to do that, don't they?
[2014.90 --> 2015.38]  I was actually
[2015.38 --> 2016.04]  They also tend
[2016.04 --> 2017.66]  to make money
[2017.66 --> 2018.32]  every quarter.
[2018.74 --> 2018.94]  Yeah.
[2019.02 --> 2019.14]  Yeah.
[2019.14 --> 2020.94]  You know,
[2021.04 --> 2021.76]  it's hard to
[2021.76 --> 2023.42]  I want openness
[2023.42 --> 2024.48]  I prefer openness
[2024.48 --> 2025.54]  and I like
[2025.54 --> 2026.50]  sometimes like AMD's
[2026.50 --> 2027.06]  approach of
[2027.06 --> 2028.04]  we're a hardware maker
[2028.04 --> 2029.22]  and we're not a software maker
[2029.22 --> 2030.28]  and we're going to be open
[2030.28 --> 2032.86]  but they are non-invest
[2032.86 --> 2033.80]  they didn't come up
[2033.80 --> 2035.18]  with G-Sync
[2035.18 --> 2035.74]  they didn't
[2035.74 --> 2036.66]  they're just sort of
[2036.66 --> 2037.46]  doing the me too thing
[2037.46 --> 2037.94]  with FreeSync
[2037.94 --> 2038.90]  NVIDIA,
[2039.14 --> 2039.72]  give them credit
[2039.72 --> 2041.26]  they invested in this
[2041.26 --> 2041.80]  and they want to
[2041.80 --> 2042.64]  get money back
[2042.64 --> 2044.58]  and I understand
[2044.58 --> 2045.22]  that I'm sympathetic
[2045.22 --> 2046.20]  to that
[2046.20 --> 2047.28]  even though I think
[2047.28 --> 2047.76]  ultimately
[2047.76 --> 2048.82]  I hope everybody
[2048.82 --> 2049.48]  in the industry
[2049.48 --> 2051.08]  wants the final destination
[2051.08 --> 2051.82]  for this to be
[2051.82 --> 2052.74]  that you can plug
[2052.74 --> 2053.32]  any monitor
[2053.32 --> 2054.36]  into any graphics card
[2054.36 --> 2055.38]  and get variable refresh.
[2055.56 --> 2056.64]  That is exactly
[2056.64 --> 2057.30]  what we want.
[2057.66 --> 2057.94]  I mean,
[2058.08 --> 2059.36]  actually I should clarify
[2059.36 --> 2059.98]  something.
[2060.18 --> 2061.32]  Last week on the show
[2061.32 --> 2062.40]  speaking of NVIDIA
[2062.40 --> 2063.22]  being closed
[2063.22 --> 2064.96]  I did a super pissed off
[2064.96 --> 2065.72]  rant for about
[2065.72 --> 2066.42]  five minutes
[2066.42 --> 2067.66]  about how the
[2067.66 --> 2068.62]  Shield controller
[2068.62 --> 2070.18]  only works
[2070.18 --> 2071.60]  on GeForce PCs
[2071.60 --> 2072.18]  right now.
[2072.26 --> 2072.56]  Did you know
[2072.56 --> 2073.14]  about this Scott?
[2073.50 --> 2074.46]  Yeah, you know
[2074.46 --> 2075.98]  I saw that.
[2076.44 --> 2077.10]  They're fixing it.
[2077.76 --> 2079.64]  I got an email
[2079.64 --> 2081.24]  at the end of the show
[2081.24 --> 2081.98]  last week
[2081.98 --> 2083.38]  Yo dawg, sorry
[2083.38 --> 2084.64]  I was driving
[2084.64 --> 2085.78]  I couldn't reply
[2085.78 --> 2088.06]  we're fixing it
[2088.06 --> 2088.76]  it's coming
[2088.76 --> 2090.42]  it'll work on any PC
[2090.42 --> 2092.20]  Please stop talking about this.
[2092.20 --> 2092.86]  Yes, please
[2092.86 --> 2094.74]  stop talking about this.
[2096.74 --> 2097.40]  But you know
[2097.40 --> 2098.44]  you gotta call them out
[2098.44 --> 2099.26]  on stuff like that
[2099.26 --> 2100.20]  because you don't want
[2100.20 --> 2101.30]  the standard to become
[2101.30 --> 2101.94]  that we're all
[2101.94 --> 2102.66]  just kind of
[2102.66 --> 2103.86]  in our different silos
[2103.86 --> 2105.84]  and GeForce is its own thing
[2105.84 --> 2107.28]  and Radeon is its own thing
[2107.28 --> 2108.06]  Can you imagine
[2108.06 --> 2108.76]  a controller
[2108.76 --> 2110.00]  that only worked
[2110.00 --> 2111.02]  on PCs
[2111.02 --> 2111.76]  with a certain
[2111.76 --> 2112.78]  brand of graphics cards?
[2112.90 --> 2113.04]  I mean
[2113.04 --> 2114.12]  we'd be
[2114.12 --> 2115.52]  never mind
[2115.52 --> 2116.80]  consoles going away
[2116.80 --> 2118.12]  and converging with PCs
[2118.12 --> 2119.10]  PCs would be
[2119.10 --> 2120.20]  converging into consoles
[2120.20 --> 2120.90]  at that point.
[2121.32 --> 2121.84]  New Intel
[2121.84 --> 2122.78]  compatible keyboards
[2122.78 --> 2124.20]  Oh no
[2124.20 --> 2125.94]  Oh no
[2125.94 --> 2128.12]  That would be bad
[2128.12 --> 2130.08]  That's terrifying
[2130.08 --> 2130.62]  Yeah
[2130.62 --> 2131.86]  But you know
[2131.86 --> 2132.98]  if it happened to one thing
[2132.98 --> 2133.94]  it would leak into
[2133.94 --> 2135.02]  all the things
[2135.02 --> 2135.76]  I know
[2135.76 --> 2136.74]  It's horrible
[2136.74 --> 2138.64]  Alright
[2138.64 --> 2138.84]  So we should have
[2138.84 --> 2139.84]  with the Samsung plant?
[2140.68 --> 2140.94]  Sorry?
[2141.46 --> 2142.66]  Well not Samsung plant
[2142.66 --> 2143.90]  but Samsung starting
[2143.90 --> 2144.66]  AMD development
[2144.66 --> 2145.30]  I guess we did
[2145.30 --> 2145.76]  Yeah we kind of
[2145.76 --> 2146.58]  talked about that already
[2146.58 --> 2147.34]  Why don't we just
[2147.34 --> 2148.26]  Hey Scott
[2148.26 --> 2149.48]  which of our topics
[2149.48 --> 2150.68]  under the guest topics
[2150.68 --> 2151.84]  are you most
[2151.84 --> 2153.62]  down to talk about?
[2154.50 --> 2154.86]  Do you remember?
[2154.96 --> 2155.54]  Did you leave and look?
[2155.96 --> 2157.08]  I am easy
[2157.08 --> 2157.78]  whatever you guys
[2157.78 --> 2158.46]  want to talk about
[2158.46 --> 2159.18]  if you want to talk
[2159.18 --> 2160.24]  more graphics
[2160.24 --> 2161.06]  if you want to talk
[2161.06 --> 2161.94]  any of the other stuff
[2161.94 --> 2162.38]  out there
[2162.38 --> 2163.72]  then I'm happy to do it
[2163.72 --> 2164.64]  I want to talk about
[2164.64 --> 2166.94]  that 17,000 Mac botnet
[2166.94 --> 2167.90]  that got discovered
[2167.90 --> 2169.70]  Oh wait
[2169.70 --> 2170.50]  that's impossible
[2170.50 --> 2171.76]  Macs don't get viruses
[2171.76 --> 2172.38]  No
[2172.38 --> 2172.90]  No
[2172.90 --> 2173.26]  No
[2173.26 --> 2173.62]  Surely
[2173.62 --> 2174.86]  Steve Jobs said
[2174.86 --> 2175.90]  they don't get viruses
[2175.90 --> 2176.58]  so therefore
[2176.58 --> 2177.84]  This isn't a virus
[2177.84 --> 2178.54]  they're just all
[2178.54 --> 2179.58]  trying to be friends
[2179.58 --> 2180.10]  Right
[2180.10 --> 2180.78]  Macs are more
[2180.78 --> 2181.64]  it's a more friendly
[2181.64 --> 2182.36]  operating system
[2182.36 --> 2183.22]  This is the new
[2183.22 --> 2184.20]  social network
[2184.20 --> 2186.30]  It's joining a botnet
[2186.30 --> 2187.34]  You're being social
[2187.34 --> 2188.26]  with other computers
[2188.26 --> 2189.00]  and trying to help
[2189.00 --> 2190.42]  everyone to one goal
[2190.42 --> 2191.58]  just might not necessarily
[2191.58 --> 2192.36]  be your goal
[2192.36 --> 2193.62]  Or really
[2193.62 --> 2195.04]  anyone who's not
[2195.04 --> 2195.64]  sort of
[2195.64 --> 2196.66]  The one dude
[2196.66 --> 2197.42]  who set it up
[2197.42 --> 2200.94]  Don't worry about it
[2200.94 --> 2201.38]  It's cool
[2201.38 --> 2202.48]  It's not a virus
[2202.48 --> 2204.42]  So okay
[2204.42 --> 2204.92]  Do you want to do
[2204.92 --> 2206.56]  a quick rundown
[2206.56 --> 2207.20]  of what the heck
[2207.20 --> 2207.66]  happened here
[2207.66 --> 2208.46]  So this was a post
[2208.46 --> 2209.52]  from gizmodo.com
[2209.52 --> 2209.96]  I'm just going to
[2209.96 --> 2210.40]  check this up
[2210.40 --> 2210.88]  on my screen
[2210.88 --> 2212.08]  while Luke gives us
[2212.08 --> 2212.62]  a rundown
[2212.62 --> 2213.10]  and then we'll
[2213.10 --> 2214.28]  move into the topic
[2214.28 --> 2214.98]  So the backdoor
[2214.98 --> 2215.28]  is called
[2215.28 --> 2217.24]  mac.backdoor.iworm
[2217.24 --> 2218.54]  because it has to be
[2218.54 --> 2219.16]  stealthy and
[2219.16 --> 2220.28]  use backdoor
[2220.28 --> 2220.72]  in the name
[2220.72 --> 2221.24]  Awesome
[2221.24 --> 2223.22]  Essentially they have
[2223.22 --> 2224.44]  gained access to
[2224.44 --> 2225.92]  Macs and they use
[2225.92 --> 2226.74]  Reddit to connect
[2226.74 --> 2227.38]  them all together
[2227.38 --> 2228.04]  So basically
[2228.04 --> 2229.56]  when the Mac calls out
[2229.56 --> 2230.20]  it goes on to
[2230.20 --> 2231.04]  Reddit and finds
[2231.04 --> 2232.04]  a post which links
[2232.04 --> 2232.76]  it to a server
[2232.76 --> 2234.26]  under a Minecraft
[2234.26 --> 2235.02]  subreddit
[2235.02 --> 2236.02]  which is hilarious
[2236.02 --> 2237.04]  and then they all
[2237.04 --> 2237.52]  link together
[2237.52 --> 2238.30]  through that
[2238.30 --> 2240.18]  So this guy has
[2240.18 --> 2240.96]  used a worm
[2240.96 --> 2242.50]  to grab all these
[2242.50 --> 2243.14]  botnet computers
[2243.14 --> 2243.72]  and have them link
[2243.72 --> 2244.64]  all together through
[2244.64 --> 2245.82]  Reddit's Minecraft
[2245.82 --> 2246.38]  community
[2246.38 --> 2247.20]  Okay so maybe you can
[2247.20 --> 2248.50]  explain what's the
[2248.50 --> 2249.64]  problem with a botnet
[2249.64 --> 2250.64]  what exactly is a
[2250.64 --> 2251.32]  botnet and what does
[2251.32 --> 2252.00]  it mean to be part
[2252.00 --> 2252.26]  of one?
[2252.28 --> 2252.74]  You can use botnets
[2252.74 --> 2253.26]  for a lot of
[2253.26 --> 2253.94]  different things
[2253.94 --> 2256.40]  a lot of the laws
[2256.40 --> 2257.18]  around like you
[2257.18 --> 2258.08]  can't sue someone
[2258.08 --> 2259.02]  for their computer
[2259.02 --> 2260.00]  necessarily doing
[2260.00 --> 2261.10]  something happens
[2261.10 --> 2262.10]  because of botnets
[2262.10 --> 2262.86]  so you can use a
[2262.86 --> 2263.74]  botnet to essentially
[2263.74 --> 2264.50]  a lot of people
[2264.50 --> 2265.54]  refer to them as
[2265.54 --> 2266.38]  zombies as well
[2266.38 --> 2267.66]  you can utilize all
[2267.66 --> 2268.46]  these computers to
[2268.46 --> 2269.60]  do things for you
[2269.60 --> 2270.26]  it's like having a
[2270.26 --> 2271.14]  gigantic external
[2271.14 --> 2272.18]  cluster so you can
[2272.18 --> 2272.90]  use these to like
[2272.90 --> 2273.88]  DDoS a target
[2273.88 --> 2276.12]  or just do
[2276.12 --> 2277.26]  other things
[2277.26 --> 2279.42]  like essentially
[2279.42 --> 2280.26]  look like users
[2280.26 --> 2281.28]  so if you want to
[2281.28 --> 2281.70]  get a whole bunch
[2281.70 --> 2282.54]  of hits on something
[2282.54 --> 2283.86]  that's a less
[2283.86 --> 2284.64]  aggressive way
[2284.64 --> 2285.94]  to use a botnet
[2285.94 --> 2287.42]  Do we actually
[2287.42 --> 2289.24]  have 4,400
[2289.24 --> 2289.90]  viewers?
[2291.24 --> 2292.58]  Who knows?
[2292.96 --> 2293.80]  Maybe we have
[2293.80 --> 2294.96]  one who owns
[2294.96 --> 2296.08]  a lot of IMAX
[2296.08 --> 2296.66]  or doesn't own
[2296.66 --> 2297.08]  a lot of IMAX
[2297.08 --> 2297.90]  And Scott
[2297.90 --> 2300.22]  No he's not
[2300.22 --> 2300.94]  viewing he's just
[2300.94 --> 2301.70]  looking through our
[2301.70 --> 2302.52]  video conferencing
[2302.52 --> 2302.92]  software
[2302.92 --> 2303.32]  Right
[2303.32 --> 2304.42]  He wouldn't even
[2304.42 --> 2304.70]  count
[2304.70 --> 2305.66]  Sorry Scott
[2305.66 --> 2306.22]  you don't count
[2306.22 --> 2306.62]  as a viewer
[2306.62 --> 2307.40]  You can use them
[2307.40 --> 2308.92]  for large variants
[2308.92 --> 2309.38]  of things
[2309.38 --> 2310.30]  but a lot of times
[2310.30 --> 2311.44]  it's just DDoS
[2311.44 --> 2312.00]  DDoS
[2312.00 --> 2312.72]  that kind of stuff
[2312.72 --> 2313.64]  bringing down websites
[2313.64 --> 2314.38]  being a jerk
[2314.38 --> 2316.32]  In this case though
[2316.32 --> 2316.94]  I wonder if he's
[2316.94 --> 2317.96]  actually using it
[2317.96 --> 2319.40]  to look like users
[2319.40 --> 2320.42]  on Minecraft servers
[2320.42 --> 2321.76]  I haven't read into it
[2321.76 --> 2322.92]  into that much
[2322.92 --> 2323.68]  but it would be
[2323.68 --> 2324.62]  pretty funny actually
[2324.62 --> 2325.96]  because if you can
[2325.96 --> 2326.50]  make your Minecraft
[2326.50 --> 2327.42]  server look popular
[2327.42 --> 2328.06]  and then get people
[2328.06 --> 2328.70]  to come to it
[2328.70 --> 2329.52]  and then actually
[2329.52 --> 2331.22]  do real microtransactions
[2331.22 --> 2332.48]  then you might make
[2332.48 --> 2332.80]  some money
[2332.80 --> 2333.50]  So Scott
[2333.50 --> 2334.76]  Is Apple imploding?
[2337.26 --> 2338.10]  There's a lot
[2338.10 --> 2338.96]  of bad PR
[2338.96 --> 2340.32]  A lot
[2340.32 --> 2342.30]  Yeah you know
[2342.30 --> 2343.38]  it is weird
[2343.38 --> 2343.88]  like the
[2343.88 --> 2345.08]  Ben Gate stuff
[2345.08 --> 2346.26]  that just
[2346.26 --> 2347.00]  was one of those
[2347.00 --> 2347.50]  tech stories
[2347.50 --> 2348.34]  that you could see
[2348.34 --> 2348.98]  it taking on
[2348.98 --> 2349.92]  a life of its own
[2349.92 --> 2351.16]  like the iPhone 6
[2351.16 --> 2351.78]  had happened
[2351.78 --> 2353.48]  it was a big deal
[2353.48 --> 2355.10]  and then
[2355.10 --> 2355.84]  there wasn't
[2355.84 --> 2356.98]  another story
[2356.98 --> 2358.54]  and so that one
[2358.54 --> 2359.06]  kind of came out
[2359.06 --> 2359.48]  on the weekend
[2359.48 --> 2360.16]  and it was like
[2360.16 --> 2361.14]  it hit the news
[2361.14 --> 2361.90]  cycle perfectly
[2361.90 --> 2362.72]  Everyone wanted
[2362.72 --> 2364.10]  more iPhone news
[2364.10 --> 2364.74]  and that was
[2364.74 --> 2365.64]  the more iPhone news
[2365.64 --> 2366.08]  I don't know
[2366.08 --> 2367.10]  did you watch
[2367.10 --> 2368.68]  the Ben videos
[2368.68 --> 2370.10]  because I got up
[2370.10 --> 2370.58]  that morning
[2370.58 --> 2371.00]  and I went
[2371.00 --> 2371.66]  and I watched
[2371.66 --> 2372.02]  one of those
[2372.02 --> 2372.44]  and I watched
[2372.44 --> 2373.54]  this guy's thumb
[2373.54 --> 2374.44]  just strain
[2374.44 --> 2375.34]  against his phone
[2375.34 --> 2375.82]  to bend it
[2375.82 --> 2376.30]  and I thought
[2376.30 --> 2377.74]  I'm not worried
[2377.74 --> 2378.64]  about that at all
[2378.64 --> 2381.40]  it's way too much
[2381.40 --> 2382.04]  force for me
[2382.04 --> 2383.04]  to ever care
[2383.04 --> 2383.54]  you know
[2383.54 --> 2384.08]  I'm not going
[2384.08 --> 2384.52]  to do that
[2384.52 --> 2385.12]  accidentally
[2385.12 --> 2385.78]  Well you need
[2385.78 --> 2386.28]  to gain about
[2386.28 --> 2387.22]  100 pounds then
[2387.22 --> 2387.56]  come on
[2387.56 --> 2388.18]  go to the gym
[2388.18 --> 2390.54]  crank up those pecs
[2390.54 --> 2391.80]  or something
[2391.80 --> 2393.94]  but it didn't matter
[2393.94 --> 2395.04]  because that story
[2395.04 --> 2396.16]  filled a void
[2396.16 --> 2396.60]  right
[2396.60 --> 2398.00]  and it was like
[2398.00 --> 2398.86]  it was everybody
[2398.86 --> 2400.04]  who's like a
[2400.04 --> 2401.22]  Samsung fan
[2401.22 --> 2402.18]  like loved it
[2402.18 --> 2402.96]  it didn't matter
[2402.96 --> 2403.74]  that it was true
[2403.74 --> 2405.32]  it just was there
[2405.32 --> 2405.78]  right
[2405.78 --> 2406.52]  but honestly
[2406.52 --> 2407.20]  I don't think
[2407.20 --> 2407.82]  that that story
[2407.82 --> 2408.56]  happens and gets
[2408.56 --> 2409.08]  that big
[2409.08 --> 2410.68]  if it isn't
[2410.68 --> 2411.28]  for the fact
[2411.28 --> 2412.40]  that everybody
[2412.40 --> 2413.16]  in the media
[2413.16 --> 2413.96]  who is reporting
[2413.96 --> 2414.30]  on that
[2414.30 --> 2415.24]  making it a big deal
[2415.24 --> 2416.52]  knows that
[2416.52 --> 2417.34]  when they report
[2417.34 --> 2417.84]  on Apple
[2417.84 --> 2418.72]  there's a lot
[2418.72 --> 2419.42]  of response
[2419.42 --> 2420.02]  yeah
[2420.02 --> 2421.18]  right
[2421.18 --> 2421.68]  and
[2421.68 --> 2422.22]  positive
[2422.22 --> 2422.74]  a lot of
[2422.74 --> 2423.06]  people will
[2423.06 --> 2423.52]  chime in
[2423.52 --> 2423.90]  no matter
[2423.90 --> 2424.48]  what it is
[2424.48 --> 2425.40]  Apple's in
[2425.40 --> 2425.72]  trouble
[2425.72 --> 2426.52]  when people
[2426.52 --> 2427.02]  don't care
[2427.02 --> 2427.38]  about what
[2427.38 --> 2427.78]  they do
[2427.78 --> 2428.38]  and they're
[2428.38 --> 2428.84]  a long way
[2428.84 --> 2429.18]  from that
[2429.18 --> 2429.62]  place right
[2429.62 --> 2429.82]  now
[2429.82 --> 2430.32]  yeah
[2430.32 --> 2431.06]  fair enough
[2431.06 --> 2431.88]  I mean
[2431.88 --> 2432.42]  there's been
[2432.42 --> 2432.94]  other bad
[2432.94 --> 2433.48]  news too
[2433.48 --> 2433.90]  so there
[2433.90 --> 2434.20]  was the
[2434.20 --> 2434.70]  report that
[2434.70 --> 2435.16]  came out
[2435.16 --> 2435.72]  that Apple
[2435.72 --> 2436.34]  reportedly
[2436.34 --> 2436.92]  punished
[2436.92 --> 2437.34]  a German
[2437.34 --> 2437.82]  magazine
[2437.82 --> 2438.46]  for doing
[2438.46 --> 2438.96]  an iPhone
[2438.96 --> 2439.56]  6 Ben
[2439.56 --> 2439.96]  test
[2439.96 --> 2440.68]  saying they
[2440.68 --> 2441.04]  would no
[2441.04 --> 2441.56]  longer be
[2441.56 --> 2442.20]  invited to
[2442.20 --> 2442.58]  any of
[2442.58 --> 2443.22]  their events
[2443.22 --> 2444.16]  and
[2444.16 --> 2445.48]  they were
[2445.48 --> 2445.90]  basically
[2445.90 --> 2446.66]  cut off
[2446.66 --> 2447.30]  I mean
[2447.30 --> 2448.16]  how do
[2448.16 --> 2449.58]  you feel
[2449.58 --> 2450.36]  as an
[2450.36 --> 2450.80]  objective
[2450.80 --> 2452.10]  journalist
[2452.10 --> 2452.98]  in the
[2452.98 --> 2453.80]  IT industry
[2453.80 --> 2454.92]  about that
[2454.92 --> 2455.32]  kind of
[2455.32 --> 2455.76]  behavior
[2455.76 --> 2456.20]  from a
[2456.20 --> 2456.70]  manufacturer
[2456.70 --> 2457.08]  because
[2457.08 --> 2457.36]  that
[2457.36 --> 2458.70]  well I want
[2458.70 --> 2459.00]  the D
[2459.00 --> 2459.32]  which we'll
[2459.32 --> 2459.64]  talk about
[2459.64 --> 2459.92]  later
[2459.92 --> 2460.52]  but
[2460.52 --> 2462.80]  so I don't
[2462.80 --> 2463.44]  necessarily care
[2463.44 --> 2464.14]  about like a
[2464.14 --> 2464.90]  paper style
[2464.90 --> 2465.38]  screen
[2465.38 --> 2468.08]  or not
[2468.08 --> 2468.62]  but I do
[2468.62 --> 2469.02]  want the
[2469.02 --> 2469.66]  round shape
[2469.66 --> 2470.24]  of a watch
[2470.24 --> 2471.08]  and that being
[2471.08 --> 2471.68]  said
[2471.68 --> 2472.38]  Pebble prices
[2472.38 --> 2473.08]  are dropping
[2473.08 --> 2474.50]  so they're
[2474.50 --> 2474.90]  reducing their
[2474.90 --> 2475.34]  price on the
[2475.34 --> 2475.90]  standard Pebble
[2475.90 --> 2476.50]  which is not
[2476.50 --> 2477.08]  what Linus
[2477.08 --> 2477.54]  has anymore
[2477.54 --> 2477.88]  you have the
[2477.88 --> 2478.40]  Pebble Steel
[2478.40 --> 2478.92]  I believe
[2478.92 --> 2479.56]  that's right
[2479.56 --> 2480.46]  they're reducing
[2480.46 --> 2480.98]  the price on the
[2480.98 --> 2481.58]  standard Pebble
[2481.58 --> 2482.10]  to around
[2482.10 --> 2482.88]  90 USD
[2482.88 --> 2483.76]  this is only
[2483.76 --> 2484.20]  in the states
[2484.20 --> 2484.78]  as far as I
[2484.78 --> 2485.00]  know
[2485.00 --> 2487.06]  to 90 USD
[2487.06 --> 2487.92]  and they're
[2487.92 --> 2488.42]  bringing the
[2488.42 --> 2488.88]  prices down
[2488.88 --> 2489.14]  on their
[2489.14 --> 2489.56]  steel
[2489.56 --> 2490.52]  to 199
[2490.52 --> 2491.20]  USD
[2491.20 --> 2491.86]  it's a pretty
[2491.86 --> 2492.32]  big difference
[2492.32 --> 2492.80]  do you think
[2492.80 --> 2493.30]  it's worth it
[2493.30 --> 2493.68]  from the
[2493.68 --> 2494.04]  standard to
[2494.04 --> 2494.32]  the steel
[2494.32 --> 2495.50]  you know
[2495.50 --> 2495.80]  what
[2495.80 --> 2496.32]  I
[2496.32 --> 2497.18]  I
[2497.18 --> 2498.58]  it depends
[2498.58 --> 2498.94]  on
[2498.94 --> 2499.42]  it depends
[2499.42 --> 2499.88]  on what
[2499.88 --> 2500.26]  you want
[2500.26 --> 2500.62]  out of your
[2500.62 --> 2500.90]  watch
[2500.90 --> 2501.30]  if you just
[2501.30 --> 2501.62]  want the
[2501.62 --> 2502.16]  functionality
[2502.16 --> 2503.32]  the functionality
[2503.32 --> 2503.78]  of them
[2503.78 --> 2505.04]  is literally
[2505.04 --> 2506.24]  exactly
[2506.24 --> 2507.10]  the same
[2507.10 --> 2508.10]  they actually
[2508.10 --> 2508.84]  have the
[2508.84 --> 2509.28]  same
[2509.28 --> 2509.96]  hardware
[2509.96 --> 2510.50]  in them
[2510.50 --> 2510.94]  I mean
[2510.94 --> 2511.32]  they didn't
[2511.32 --> 2512.00]  even bother
[2512.00 --> 2512.68]  to upgrade
[2512.68 --> 2513.54]  the battery
[2513.54 --> 2514.08]  on the
[2514.08 --> 2514.36]  steel
[2514.36 --> 2515.22]  which in
[2515.22 --> 2515.72]  my mind
[2515.72 --> 2516.48]  is a little
[2516.48 --> 2517.28]  bit frustrating
[2517.28 --> 2518.06]  I don't see
[2518.06 --> 2518.56]  any reason
[2518.56 --> 2519.00]  why they
[2519.00 --> 2519.34]  couldn't have
[2519.34 --> 2519.68]  made the
[2519.68 --> 2520.02]  steel
[2520.02 --> 2520.80]  you know
[2520.80 --> 2521.70]  a 9 day
[2521.70 --> 2522.14]  battery
[2522.14 --> 2522.60]  or something
[2522.60 --> 2522.98]  like that
[2522.98 --> 2523.34]  give me
[2523.34 --> 2524.42]  some kind
[2524.42 --> 2525.02]  of extra
[2525.02 --> 2525.64]  functionality
[2525.64 --> 2526.54]  the steel
[2526.54 --> 2527.24]  is all
[2527.24 --> 2527.68]  about the
[2527.68 --> 2527.90]  look
[2527.90 --> 2528.36]  so if
[2528.36 --> 2528.74]  you wear
[2528.74 --> 2529.34]  your watch
[2529.34 --> 2529.76]  as a
[2529.76 --> 2530.06]  purely
[2530.06 --> 2530.60]  functional
[2530.60 --> 2531.06]  piece
[2531.06 --> 2531.76]  because you
[2531.76 --> 2532.04]  would like
[2532.04 --> 2532.32]  to know
[2532.32 --> 2532.70]  what time
[2532.70 --> 2532.96]  it is
[2532.96 --> 2533.22]  and read
[2533.22 --> 2533.82]  text messages
[2533.82 --> 2534.26]  and all
[2534.26 --> 2534.60]  those other
[2534.60 --> 2535.12]  cool pebble
[2535.12 --> 2535.52]  apps
[2535.52 --> 2536.80]  get a regular
[2536.80 --> 2537.16]  pebble
[2537.16 --> 2537.50]  right
[2537.50 --> 2539.12]  if your watch
[2539.12 --> 2540.36]  is part of
[2540.36 --> 2544.82]  the look
[2544.82 --> 2545.96]  of you
[2545.96 --> 2546.74]  that you're
[2546.74 --> 2547.18]  trying to
[2547.18 --> 2547.48]  achieve
[2547.48 --> 2547.94]  if it's a
[2547.94 --> 2548.62]  fashion statement
[2548.62 --> 2549.06]  then maybe
[2549.06 --> 2549.42]  the steel
[2549.42 --> 2550.50]  in my opinion
[2550.50 --> 2551.00]  the steel
[2551.00 --> 2551.58]  is a great
[2551.58 --> 2552.02]  value
[2552.02 --> 2552.70]  I mean
[2552.70 --> 2553.02]  you can
[2553.02 --> 2553.70]  easily
[2553.70 --> 2554.12]  spend
[2554.12 --> 2554.56]  $200
[2554.56 --> 2555.20]  on a watch
[2555.20 --> 2555.58]  you can
[2555.58 --> 2555.66]  spend
[2555.66 --> 2556.52]  5,
[2556.62 --> 2556.88]  10,
[2557.04 --> 2557.78]  15 times
[2557.78 --> 2558.02]  that
[2558.02 --> 2558.58]  on a watch
[2558.58 --> 2559.04]  on a watch
[2559.04 --> 2560.80]  that doesn't
[2560.80 --> 2561.28]  have that
[2561.28 --> 2561.62]  functionality
[2561.62 --> 2561.98]  there
[2561.98 --> 2562.44]  I think
[2562.44 --> 2562.64]  that's
[2562.64 --> 2562.88]  what the
[2562.88 --> 2563.10]  steel
[2563.10 --> 2563.32]  is
[2563.32 --> 2563.80]  it's a
[2563.80 --> 2564.12]  great
[2564.12 --> 2564.68]  marriage
[2564.68 --> 2565.18]  of
[2565.18 --> 2565.74]  functionality
[2565.74 --> 2567.04]  and
[2567.04 --> 2568.50]  at least
[2568.50 --> 2568.84]  a little
[2568.84 --> 2569.12]  bit of
[2569.12 --> 2569.32]  style
[2569.32 --> 2569.80]  2,000 meters
[2569.80 --> 2570.40]  underwater
[2570.40 --> 2571.96]  sorry what
[2571.96 --> 2573.18]  some of those
[2573.18 --> 2573.74]  super high end
[2573.74 --> 2574.46]  watches are like
[2574.46 --> 2574.86]  oh yeah
[2574.86 --> 2575.46]  but it'll work
[2575.46 --> 2576.24]  2,000 meters
[2576.24 --> 2576.68]  underwater
[2576.68 --> 2577.08]  and I'm like
[2577.08 --> 2577.80]  wow cool
[2577.80 --> 2578.32]  for when I'm
[2578.32 --> 2579.02]  in a submarine
[2579.02 --> 2579.64]  next
[2579.64 --> 2580.44]  what
[2580.44 --> 2581.36]  for when I'm
[2581.36 --> 2582.14]  completely
[2582.14 --> 2583.10]  underwater
[2583.10 --> 2583.74]  and dead
[2583.74 --> 2584.14]  and out
[2584.14 --> 2584.92]  of oxygen
[2584.92 --> 2586.38]  awesome
[2586.38 --> 2588.26]  so Swift
[2588.26 --> 2588.70]  Tech launches
[2588.70 --> 2589.96]  their 240x
[2589.96 --> 2590.94]  h240x
[2590.94 --> 2591.22]  I believe
[2591.22 --> 2591.60]  this was
[2591.60 --> 2592.56]  fairly stealthy
[2592.56 --> 2593.84]  I saw a bunch
[2593.84 --> 2594.42]  of the comments
[2594.42 --> 2595.36]  on the forum
[2595.36 --> 2595.98]  thread about this
[2595.98 --> 2596.52]  posted by
[2596.52 --> 2597.04]  worldwin
[2597.04 --> 2597.70]  oh I should
[2597.70 --> 2598.24]  jump up
[2598.24 --> 2599.32]  so the
[2599.32 --> 2600.06]  new patch
[2600.06 --> 2600.24]  from the
[2600.24 --> 2600.72]  moto 360
[2600.72 --> 2601.16]  was posted
[2601.16 --> 2601.56]  on the forum
[2601.56 --> 2602.12]  by ren
[2602.12 --> 2603.00]  the pebble
[2603.00 --> 2603.50]  price drops
[2603.50 --> 2603.92]  was posted
[2603.92 --> 2604.50]  on the forum
[2604.50 --> 2605.24]  by raf
[2605.24 --> 2606.52]  banan
[2606.52 --> 2607.68]  there's two
[2607.68 --> 2608.16]  a's there
[2608.16 --> 2608.60]  I don't know
[2608.60 --> 2609.02]  how to properly
[2609.02 --> 2609.36]  do that
[2609.36 --> 2609.72]  other than
[2609.72 --> 2610.74]  aaaah
[2610.74 --> 2611.48]  so
[2611.48 --> 2612.78]  he wins
[2612.78 --> 2613.34]  the literally
[2613.34 --> 2614.12]  entire world
[2614.12 --> 2614.40]  yeah
[2614.40 --> 2615.72]  win the world
[2615.72 --> 2616.82]  the whole
[2616.82 --> 2617.24]  thing
[2617.24 --> 2617.72]  everything
[2617.72 --> 2618.28]  that you
[2618.28 --> 2618.76]  can possibly
[2618.76 --> 2619.04]  win
[2619.04 --> 2619.38]  is won
[2619.38 --> 2619.72]  by him
[2619.72 --> 2620.32]  anyways
[2620.32 --> 2621.52]  I believe
[2621.52 --> 2621.70]  it was
[2621.70 --> 2622.22]  fairly stealthy
[2622.22 --> 2622.56]  because a whole
[2622.56 --> 2622.78]  bunch of
[2622.78 --> 2623.58]  posters on
[2623.58 --> 2624.04]  the forum
[2624.04 --> 2625.16]  were talking
[2625.16 --> 2625.42]  about how
[2625.42 --> 2625.66]  they were
[2625.66 --> 2626.26]  actually looking
[2626.26 --> 2626.98]  to buy
[2626.98 --> 2627.96]  a 240x
[2627.96 --> 2628.30]  and then
[2628.30 --> 2628.82]  just randomly
[2628.82 --> 2629.68]  saw on
[2629.68 --> 2630.14]  Swift Tech's
[2630.14 --> 2630.36]  website
[2630.36 --> 2630.76]  that there
[2630.76 --> 2631.48]  was a
[2631.48 --> 2632.20]  sorry
[2632.20 --> 2632.54]  they were
[2632.54 --> 2632.82]  looking to
[2632.82 --> 2633.70]  buy a 220x
[2633.70 --> 2634.54]  and then they
[2634.54 --> 2634.90]  saw on the
[2634.90 --> 2635.26]  website that
[2635.26 --> 2635.58]  there was a
[2635.58 --> 2636.28]  240x
[2636.28 --> 2637.66]  I don't think
[2637.66 --> 2638.00]  there's any
[2638.00 --> 2639.68]  massive changes
[2639.68 --> 2640.26]  other than the
[2640.26 --> 2640.60]  fact that it
[2640.60 --> 2641.08]  is a dual
[2641.08 --> 2642.14]  140mm
[2642.14 --> 2643.44]  copper radiator
[2643.44 --> 2644.30]  other than that
[2644.30 --> 2644.78]  I believe it's
[2644.78 --> 2645.54]  the same type
[2645.54 --> 2646.08]  of idea
[2646.08 --> 2646.86]  so they have
[2646.86 --> 2647.76]  a full pump
[2647.76 --> 2648.92]  a full radiator
[2648.92 --> 2650.60]  reservoir attached
[2650.60 --> 2651.14]  to the radiator
[2651.14 --> 2652.00]  and then a full
[2652.00 --> 2653.86]  standard water
[2653.86 --> 2654.22]  block
[2654.22 --> 2655.20]  so I think
[2655.20 --> 2655.86]  this is essentially
[2655.86 --> 2656.54]  as close as you
[2656.54 --> 2657.58]  can get to
[2657.58 --> 2658.64]  standard water
[2658.64 --> 2659.68]  cooling with
[2659.68 --> 2660.92]  an AIO style
[2660.92 --> 2661.70]  unit out of
[2661.70 --> 2662.04]  anything
[2662.04 --> 2663.12]  would you agree
[2663.12 --> 2663.56]  with that
[2663.56 --> 2664.20]  probably
[2664.20 --> 2665.40]  yeah pretty much
[2665.40 --> 2666.14]  I think it's
[2666.14 --> 2666.74]  cool how they
[2666.74 --> 2667.38]  hide the pump
[2667.38 --> 2668.62]  up behind the
[2668.62 --> 2669.46]  flow rate monitor
[2669.46 --> 2670.06]  in the top
[2670.06 --> 2670.88]  which makes it
[2670.88 --> 2671.46]  look extremely
[2671.46 --> 2672.44]  compact but then
[2672.44 --> 2673.20]  still uses full
[2673.20 --> 2673.84]  size components
[2673.84 --> 2674.76]  which is awesome
[2674.76 --> 2675.76]  something that I
[2675.76 --> 2676.52]  appreciate a lot
[2676.52 --> 2677.36]  I don't see a lot
[2677.36 --> 2678.20]  of AIOs failing
[2678.20 --> 2679.26]  but it's still
[2679.26 --> 2679.92]  nice to know
[2679.92 --> 2680.60]  that I have this
[2680.60 --> 2681.50]  full size pump
[2681.50 --> 2682.26]  which I could
[2682.26 --> 2683.12]  honestly swap out
[2683.12 --> 2683.60]  if I really
[2683.60 --> 2684.18]  needed to
[2684.18 --> 2686.08]  I like
[2686.08 --> 2686.70]  I like
[2686.70 --> 2688.14]  AIOs that
[2688.14 --> 2689.38]  are after
[2689.38 --> 2690.20]  the concept
[2690.20 --> 2691.40]  of being
[2691.40 --> 2692.66]  more like
[2692.66 --> 2693.50]  an actual
[2693.50 --> 2694.82]  liquid cooling
[2694.82 --> 2695.26]  setup
[2695.26 --> 2696.10]  I think that's
[2696.10 --> 2696.98]  I think that's
[2696.98 --> 2697.66]  a great direction
[2697.66 --> 2698.46]  for them to go
[2698.46 --> 2699.32]  Swift Tech's done
[2699.32 --> 2700.72]  an okay job
[2700.72 --> 2701.80]  of making their
[2701.80 --> 2703.36]  AIOs drop in
[2703.36 --> 2704.34]  I think that
[2704.34 --> 2704.94]  their last
[2704.94 --> 2705.86]  generation one
[2705.86 --> 2706.74]  actually did a
[2706.74 --> 2707.74]  better job of
[2707.74 --> 2708.04]  this
[2708.04 --> 2708.90]  of making it
[2708.90 --> 2709.38]  drop in
[2709.38 --> 2710.10]  because it did
[2710.10 --> 2710.64]  have the pump
[2710.64 --> 2711.38]  integrated with
[2711.38 --> 2712.22]  the CPU block
[2712.22 --> 2713.40]  so you could
[2713.40 --> 2714.22]  mount the radiator
[2714.22 --> 2715.32]  in different places
[2715.32 --> 2716.14]  much more easily
[2716.14 --> 2717.08]  whereas these ones
[2717.08 --> 2717.88]  really have to go
[2717.88 --> 2718.52]  on the top of your
[2718.52 --> 2718.80]  case
[2718.80 --> 2720.80]  but the newer
[2720.80 --> 2721.58]  ones so the
[2721.58 --> 2722.68]  H220X and the
[2722.68 --> 2724.02]  H240X the fact
[2724.02 --> 2725.10]  that they are
[2725.10 --> 2725.72]  mounted in the
[2725.72 --> 2726.38]  top of the case
[2726.38 --> 2727.14]  but they're much
[2727.14 --> 2728.04]  more expandable
[2728.04 --> 2729.38]  and much more
[2729.38 --> 2730.48]  reliable from what
[2730.48 --> 2731.18]  Swift Tech's saying
[2731.18 --> 2732.24]  about them is
[2732.24 --> 2733.88]  also great too
[2733.88 --> 2734.90]  so I mean
[2734.90 --> 2736.28]  maybe there's
[2736.28 --> 2737.18]  room for Swift
[2737.18 --> 2737.84]  Tech to have
[2737.84 --> 2738.70]  both options
[2738.70 --> 2739.68]  a less powerful
[2739.68 --> 2741.34]  central CPU
[2741.34 --> 2742.38]  block based pump
[2742.38 --> 2743.12]  unit where you
[2743.12 --> 2743.48]  have more
[2743.48 --> 2744.36]  radiator flexibility
[2744.36 --> 2745.78]  and then these
[2745.78 --> 2747.30]  H220X X series
[2747.30 --> 2748.80]  ones to take
[2748.80 --> 2749.24]  care of people
[2749.24 --> 2749.78]  who are okay
[2749.78 --> 2750.40]  having it in the
[2750.40 --> 2751.16]  top and only
[2751.16 --> 2751.90]  the top and
[2751.90 --> 2752.76]  that is it
[2752.76 --> 2753.48]  that is going to
[2753.48 --> 2754.18]  be very applicable
[2754.18 --> 2755.14]  in a couple days
[2755.14 --> 2755.78]  yeah I won't be
[2755.78 --> 2756.44]  doing that accent
[2756.44 --> 2757.00]  when we're over there
[2757.00 --> 2757.52]  not so much
[2757.52 --> 2758.20]  probably not a
[2758.20 --> 2758.74]  terrible idea
[2758.74 --> 2760.28]  yeah so for
[2760.28 --> 2760.84]  those of you who
[2760.84 --> 2761.44]  don't know this
[2761.44 --> 2762.26]  already Luke and
[2762.26 --> 2763.60]  I are doing a
[2763.60 --> 2765.50]  German road trip
[2765.50 --> 2766.26]  German excursion
[2766.26 --> 2767.24]  yeah we're going
[2767.24 --> 2768.22]  to be touring the
[2768.22 --> 2769.56]  Sennheiser factory
[2769.56 --> 2771.04]  which is going to
[2771.04 --> 2771.60]  be pretty cool
[2771.60 --> 2772.00]  that's going to be
[2772.00 --> 2772.26]  sweet
[2772.26 --> 2772.64]  we're going to
[2772.64 --> 2773.70]  meet like the
[2773.70 --> 2774.76]  dude who designs
[2774.76 --> 2775.90]  like the headphones
[2775.90 --> 2777.18]  that's awesome
[2777.18 --> 2777.80]  which is going to
[2777.80 --> 2778.06]  be cool
[2778.06 --> 2778.70]  I'm actually so
[2778.70 --> 2779.88]  stoked but more
[2779.88 --> 2780.94]  stoked for
[2780.94 --> 2782.46]  Cherry MX
[2782.46 --> 2783.60]  so we're going to
[2783.60 --> 2784.74]  see Cherry Corpse
[2784.74 --> 2786.04]  manufacturing facility
[2786.04 --> 2787.76]  as well so next
[2787.76 --> 2788.72]  week is going to
[2788.72 --> 2790.00]  be all about
[2790.00 --> 2790.78]  the German
[2790.78 --> 2792.16]  engineering and
[2792.16 --> 2792.92]  the German
[2792.92 --> 2795.12]  manufacturing so
[2795.12 --> 2796.14]  both for keyboard
[2796.14 --> 2797.18]  switches and for
[2797.18 --> 2798.94]  headphones both Luke
[2798.94 --> 2800.20]  and I I guess if you
[2800.20 --> 2801.06]  were going to pick
[2801.06 --> 2802.96]  like you know half a
[2802.96 --> 2804.44]  dozen companies that
[2804.44 --> 2805.60]  we think are pretty
[2805.60 --> 2806.70]  cool and we tend to
[2806.70 --> 2807.58]  really like what they
[2807.58 --> 2808.76]  do I think Cherry
[2808.76 --> 2809.72]  would be on the list
[2809.72 --> 2810.60]  and Sennheiser would
[2810.60 --> 2811.36]  be on the list as
[2811.36 --> 2813.46]  well so we're pretty
[2813.46 --> 2814.68]  pretty stoked to check
[2814.68 --> 2815.16]  that out
[2815.16 --> 2816.04]  definitely stoked on
[2816.04 --> 2817.54]  that change oh no
[2817.54 --> 2818.54]  you go that was
[2818.54 --> 2819.78]  posted no that was
[2819.78 --> 2820.68]  not posted by him
[2820.68 --> 2821.90]  yeah right whirlwind
[2821.90 --> 2823.42]  speaking of things
[2823.42 --> 2824.68]  that are we should
[2824.68 --> 2825.66]  probably check out
[2825.66 --> 2827.82]  Windows 10 not
[2827.82 --> 2829.18]  Windows 9 it's funny
[2829.18 --> 2829.92]  because we made that
[2829.92 --> 2831.20]  joke Windows 9
[2831.20 --> 2832.88]  Windows Windows no
[2832.88 --> 2835.86]  and we were right
[2835.86 --> 2837.48]  yep actually that is
[2837.48 --> 2838.60]  kind of true and the
[2838.60 --> 2839.66]  reason they did it was
[2839.66 --> 2841.26]  because they wanted to
[2841.26 --> 2843.36]  separate the next
[2843.36 --> 2844.78]  Windows from Windows
[2844.78 --> 2847.28]  8.1 as much as
[2847.28 --> 2848.52]  possible basically
[2848.52 --> 2850.04]  they didn't want
[2850.04 --> 2851.16]  people to feel like
[2851.16 --> 2852.50]  it was an iterative
[2852.50 --> 2854.08]  improvement on Windows
[2854.08 --> 2856.04]  8 which honestly I
[2856.04 --> 2856.92]  don't think Windows
[2856.92 --> 2857.78]  9 would have sounded
[2857.78 --> 2859.16]  like if they called it
[2859.16 --> 2860.74]  Windows 8.2 that
[2860.74 --> 2861.46]  probably would have
[2861.46 --> 2862.14]  sounded like an
[2862.14 --> 2862.36]  iteration
[2862.36 --> 2863.14]  they're super drunk
[2863.14 --> 2864.28]  to be completely honest
[2864.28 --> 2865.12]  that's all I really
[2865.12 --> 2865.80]  have to say about that
[2865.80 --> 2866.70]  that's super dumb
[2866.70 --> 2867.54]  it's funny because
[2867.54 --> 2868.82]  they made the joke
[2868.82 --> 2870.24]  about we're gonna
[2870.24 --> 2871.54]  call it Windows 1
[2871.54 --> 2873.04]  yeah yeah yeah
[2873.04 --> 2874.34]  and they weren't even
[2874.34 --> 2875.92]  self-aware enough as
[2875.92 --> 2877.08]  far as I can tell to
[2877.08 --> 2878.00]  realize that just
[2878.00 --> 2878.88]  because they didn't
[2878.88 --> 2880.42]  call it 1 doesn't
[2880.42 --> 2881.14]  mean that what they
[2881.14 --> 2882.00]  did was any less
[2882.00 --> 2884.54]  stupid it's still not
[2884.54 --> 2886.30]  how you count Vista
[2886.30 --> 2888.68]  7 8 10 come on they
[2888.68 --> 2890.08]  can't even hold it
[2890.08 --> 2891.54]  together for three
[2891.54 --> 2892.90]  releases in a row
[2892.90 --> 2894.18]  actually yes they can
[2894.18 --> 2896.70]  95 98 2000 there you
[2896.70 --> 2898.24]  go okay so they can't
[2898.24 --> 2899.08]  even hold it together
[2899.08 --> 2900.64]  for four releases in a
[2900.64 --> 2902.00]  row yeah oh wait
[2902.00 --> 2902.88]  well hold on a second
[2902.88 --> 2906.08]  me came first but it's
[2906.08 --> 2910.32]  oh but me is
[2910.32 --> 2912.12]  millennium still
[2912.12 --> 2913.26]  referencing a year
[2913.26 --> 2916.38]  oh come on now no I
[2916.38 --> 2917.56]  know I agree with you
[2917.56 --> 2920.62]  but they like sort of
[2920.62 --> 2922.34]  tried at least they
[2922.34 --> 2923.30]  didn't just completely
[2923.30 --> 2924.36]  skip a number they
[2924.36 --> 2926.68]  weren't like 2014 but
[2926.68 --> 2929.06]  it's 2000 but we're
[2929.06 --> 2929.90]  gonna release 2014
[2929.90 --> 2931.22]  because it sounds much
[2931.22 --> 2932.96]  better one of my
[2932.96 --> 2933.96]  favorite quotes was I
[2933.96 --> 2934.64]  don't remember exactly
[2934.64 --> 2935.28]  what he said but
[2935.28 --> 2936.22]  essentially it was along
[2936.22 --> 2937.18]  the lines of once you
[2937.18 --> 2937.96]  once you fire up
[2937.96 --> 2939.14]  Windows 10 and you see
[2939.14 --> 2940.36]  how awesome it is you
[2940.36 --> 2941.56]  won't question why we
[2941.56 --> 2943.32]  jumped a number it's
[2943.32 --> 2944.74]  like actually that has
[2944.74 --> 2945.50]  nothing to do with
[2945.50 --> 2947.22]  anything ever at any
[2947.22 --> 2948.00]  point in time that
[2948.00 --> 2949.52]  makes no sense at all
[2949.52 --> 2951.42]  because even if it was
[2951.42 --> 2952.96]  a massive change like
[2952.96 --> 2955.28]  XP to Vista it wasn't
[2955.28 --> 2956.56]  like you didn't go like
[2956.56 --> 2960.36]  XP to XP 3 because
[2960.36 --> 2961.30]  what that would
[2961.30 --> 2961.98]  make any sense
[2961.98 --> 2964.28]  anyways I've seen
[2964.28 --> 2964.90]  quite a few people
[2964.90 --> 2965.54]  that have tried it so
[2965.54 --> 2966.70]  far and it seems kind
[2966.70 --> 2968.40]  of generally broken to
[2968.40 --> 2969.28]  be completely honest
[2969.28 --> 2971.90]  the GUI is apparently
[2971.90 --> 2972.96]  far from complete
[2972.96 --> 2973.80]  there's a lot of
[2973.80 --> 2974.88]  problems it seems very
[2974.88 --> 2975.92]  unpolished there's a
[2975.92 --> 2976.52]  tons of missing
[2976.52 --> 2978.10]  innovations all that
[2978.10 --> 2979.12]  kind of stuff and
[2979.12 --> 2980.04]  their biggest feature
[2980.04 --> 2980.84]  that they're toting is
[2980.84 --> 2981.76]  the return of the start
[2981.76 --> 2982.74]  menu which is
[2982.74 --> 2985.42]  fantastic but but
[2985.42 --> 2986.72]  also a little frustrating
[2986.72 --> 2987.74]  because when they first
[2987.74 --> 2988.98]  showed off this hybrid
[2988.98 --> 2991.28]  start menu start screen
[2991.28 --> 2993.08]  thing it was being
[2993.08 --> 2994.24]  pitched as a feature
[2994.24 --> 2994.98]  that we were going to
[2994.98 --> 2996.06]  see in the next update
[2996.06 --> 2998.42]  to Windows 8.1 yes and
[2998.42 --> 2999.68]  oh hold on we're not
[2999.68 --> 3000.60]  doing that okay hold on
[3000.60 --> 3002.34]  a second um hold off
[3002.34 --> 3003.20]  for a couple months now
[3003.20 --> 3003.84]  we're going to throw you
[3003.84 --> 3005.24]  guys this Windows 10
[3005.24 --> 3006.48]  preview which isn't
[3006.48 --> 3007.26]  going to come into out
[3007.26 --> 3009.72]  until late 2015 yeah
[3009.72 --> 3011.62]  we're we're months away
[3011.62 --> 3013.28]  we're almost a year away
[3013.28 --> 3015.08]  from Windows 10 actually
[3015.08 --> 3016.04]  being something you can
[3016.04 --> 3017.22]  install on your system
[3017.22 --> 3018.30]  and run as a production
[3018.30 --> 3019.80]  OS production OS yeah
[3019.80 --> 3020.80]  okay because you can get
[3020.80 --> 3021.74]  the technical preview
[3021.74 --> 3022.64]  right now but it is
[3022.64 --> 3023.86]  right now totally broken
[3023.86 --> 3024.72]  balls and it has some
[3024.72 --> 3025.92]  cool stuff like now
[3025.92 --> 3026.72]  instead of just being
[3026.72 --> 3027.98]  able to snap windows to
[3027.98 --> 3029.22]  the sides yes side by
[3029.22 --> 3030.32]  side reading you can
[3030.32 --> 3031.86]  snap to corners so you
[3031.86 --> 3032.78]  can actually have four
[3032.78 --> 3033.52]  things on screen
[3033.52 --> 3034.52]  something folks with
[3034.52 --> 3035.82]  large monitors are
[3035.82 --> 3036.50]  going to be pretty
[3036.50 --> 3038.28]  impressed with and then
[3038.28 --> 3039.28]  another really cool thing
[3039.28 --> 3040.06]  about it is you can
[3040.06 --> 3041.14]  actually have virtual
[3041.14 --> 3042.68]  desktops it's funny
[3042.68 --> 3044.02]  because I've seen
[3044.02 --> 3045.72]  virtual desktops working
[3045.72 --> 3048.44]  as far back as third
[3048.44 --> 3051.02]  party UI modifiers for
[3051.02 --> 3052.24]  Windows XP I was good
[3052.24 --> 3052.94]  yeah I was gonna say
[3052.94 --> 3054.12]  like as far back as
[3054.12 --> 3055.52]  super far back and
[3055.52 --> 3056.88]  yesterday because they
[3056.88 --> 3058.54]  could work now yes
[3058.54 --> 3060.06]  they're not new so so
[3060.06 --> 3061.42]  it's not a new idea but
[3061.42 --> 3062.60]  basically a virtual
[3062.60 --> 3063.96]  desktop would be
[3063.96 --> 3065.92]  different different
[3065.92 --> 3066.98]  different desktops
[3066.98 --> 3067.70]  depending on what you
[3067.70 --> 3068.46]  want to do so you can
[3068.46 --> 3069.42]  have a different set of
[3069.42 --> 3070.92]  applications open and
[3070.92 --> 3071.86]  have them spread out a
[3071.86 --> 3073.10]  different way depending
[3073.10 --> 3074.54]  on what kind of thing
[3074.54 --> 3075.44]  you want to do so for
[3075.44 --> 3079.00]  example you could have
[3079.00 --> 3081.26]  like steam and you play
[3081.26 --> 3083.90]  and origin and you said
[3083.90 --> 3084.72]  Warner Brothers maybe
[3084.72 --> 3085.82]  that Warner Brothers one
[3085.82 --> 3086.62]  that they're working on
[3086.62 --> 3087.60]  oh what a nightmare
[3087.60 --> 3089.26]  anyway you could have
[3089.26 --> 3090.54]  one virtual desktop that
[3090.54 --> 3091.84]  has all those pop-ups so
[3091.84 --> 3092.90]  all your game libraries
[3092.90 --> 3093.86]  are right there in front of
[3093.86 --> 3094.60]  you you could have
[3094.60 --> 3096.20]  another one that has you
[3096.20 --> 3098.00]  know Chrome up here and
[3098.00 --> 3099.70]  then you know Word over
[3099.70 --> 3101.18]  here and something else
[3101.18 --> 3102.46]  like a video over here so
[3102.46 --> 3103.14]  you can sit and watch
[3103.14 --> 3104.30]  streams while you research
[3104.30 --> 3105.14]  and do homework for
[3105.14 --> 3106.82]  example and then you are
[3106.82 --> 3107.76]  supposed to it's a little
[3107.76 --> 3108.74]  glitchy right now especially
[3108.74 --> 3110.02]  for multi-monitor users
[3110.02 --> 3111.10]  you're supposed to be able
[3111.10 --> 3112.06]  to switch between them
[3112.06 --> 3113.84]  that's pretty friggin cool
[3113.84 --> 3116.34]  yes it is but it's also
[3116.34 --> 3117.88]  been a previous feature of
[3117.88 --> 3119.70]  Windows kind of been a
[3119.70 --> 3120.68]  feature of Linux for an
[3120.68 --> 3122.70]  extremely long time yes and
[3122.70 --> 3123.74]  is able to be done by
[3123.74 --> 3124.62]  third-party applications
[3124.62 --> 3125.60]  already one thing that I
[3125.60 --> 3127.42]  know that's definitely
[3127.42 --> 3128.06]  going to come up with a
[3128.06 --> 3128.54]  whole bunch of search
[3128.54 --> 3129.60]  results I just hope they
[3129.60 --> 3130.92]  at least divide it in a
[3130.92 --> 3131.74]  very good way and they
[3131.74 --> 3132.52]  don't put web search
[3132.52 --> 3133.68]  results at the top or
[3133.68 --> 3134.18]  it's extremely
[3134.18 --> 3135.36]  configurable either one I'll
[3135.36 --> 3136.32]  be happy about one thing
[3136.32 --> 3137.08]  that we were talking about
[3137.08 --> 3139.24]  was we were questioning
[3139.24 --> 3141.30]  whether or not those tiles
[3141.30 --> 3142.12]  were going to be extremely
[3142.12 --> 3143.22]  configurable because I
[3143.22 --> 3143.96]  talked about how it could
[3143.96 --> 3145.30]  be pretty cool if you
[3145.30 --> 3147.20]  wanted to put like certain
[3147.20 --> 3148.48]  websites that you go to a
[3148.48 --> 3149.52]  lot and then a whole bunch
[3149.52 --> 3150.82]  of games and stuff right but
[3150.82 --> 3151.74]  I didn't want it to like
[3151.74 --> 3153.02]  just be an auto population
[3153.02 --> 3153.74]  or something like that
[3153.74 --> 3155.16]  it is a configurable space
[3155.16 --> 3157.16]  right and one thing that
[3157.16 --> 3158.32]  could be really interesting
[3158.32 --> 3159.56]  actually is if they made
[3159.56 --> 3160.60]  it so that those switching
[3160.60 --> 3161.84]  desktops were able to have
[3161.84 --> 3162.78]  their own unique start
[3162.78 --> 3164.32]  menus mm-hmm so maybe you
[3164.32 --> 3165.12]  could have a production
[3165.12 --> 3167.66]  production desktop we have
[3167.66 --> 3169.64]  like Excel word all that
[3169.64 --> 3171.66]  junk and like work websites
[3171.66 --> 3174.72]  in the nice kind of like I'm
[3174.72 --> 3175.58]  gonna say Metro that's not
[3175.58 --> 3177.00]  the right word modern UI style
[3177.00 --> 3178.20]  tiles on the right-hand side
[3178.20 --> 3179.42]  and then you switch to like
[3179.42 --> 3180.70]  your gaming one it's like
[3180.70 --> 3181.84]  gaming websites linus
[3181.84 --> 3184.12]  desktops.com steam all that
[3184.12 --> 3185.86]  crap yeah I'd love that that
[3185.86 --> 3186.58]  would be pretty cool I don't
[3186.58 --> 3187.76]  know if that's a thing but
[3187.76 --> 3188.98]  that would be cool yeah we'll
[3188.98 --> 3190.20]  have to look into it I mean
[3190.20 --> 3192.74]  honestly I've been gearing up
[3192.74 --> 3193.88]  for the trip to Germany making
[3193.88 --> 3194.76]  sure that we're gonna have
[3194.76 --> 3195.84]  some videos while we're gone
[3195.84 --> 3197.50]  we've actually got some great
[3197.50 --> 3199.12]  videos queued up we're gonna be
[3199.12 --> 3202.12]  taking a look at the 5820k so
[3202.12 --> 3203.88]  that's Intel's lower cost six
[3203.88 --> 3206.12]  core on LGA 2011 versus the
[3206.12 --> 3208.84]  5930k and because the main
[3208.84 --> 3210.32]  difference between these chips is
[3210.32 --> 3211.74]  like a six percent difference in
[3211.74 --> 3215.48]  clock speed and that's it except
[3215.48 --> 3218.96]  that the 5820k has quite a few
[3218.96 --> 3220.66]  fewer it's actually got 12 fewer
[3220.66 --> 3223.56]  PCI Express lanes so multi GPU
[3223.56 --> 3225.68]  support is limited in terms of how
[3225.68 --> 3227.08]  much bandwidth that can deliver to
[3227.08 --> 3228.74]  each card so we take a really close
[3228.74 --> 3231.26]  look at how that affects
[3231.26 --> 3233.30]  performance then we've got another
[3233.30 --> 3234.50]  really great one where we're going to
[3234.50 --> 3237.20]  be looking at SLI scaling with GTX 980
[3237.20 --> 3239.88]  from one GPU to two to three to four
[3239.88 --> 3242.68]  at 4k how it scales and how the
[3242.68 --> 3244.54]  gameplay experience is affected by
[3244.54 --> 3246.10]  adding more graphics cards so I'm
[3246.10 --> 3247.54]  pretty I'm pretty stoked on those
[3247.54 --> 3249.22]  will be pretty cool videos and then I
[3249.22 --> 3250.60]  even have my ultimate keycap
[3250.60 --> 3252.44]  replacement guide yes I've been
[3252.44 --> 3254.48]  working on a lot lately I think that's
[3254.48 --> 3256.36]  scheduled for next Tuesday night it's
[3256.92 --> 3259.08]  an ultimate guide so remember guys our
[3259.08 --> 3261.32]  ultimate guides are the best videos we
[3261.32 --> 3263.86]  can make so our build guides things like
[3263.86 --> 3265.64]  that graphics card water block
[3265.64 --> 3267.52]  installation guide although that's a
[3267.52 --> 3268.64]  bit of an older ultimate guide we're
[3268.64 --> 3271.76]  better now but Luke's is looking like
[3271.76 --> 3273.82]  it's shaping up to be pretty darn cool
[3273.82 --> 3275.66]  the only thing I'm worried about is
[3275.66 --> 3278.02]  while it's being edited I will not be in
[3278.02 --> 3282.36]  the country yes and it's very long so I
[3282.36 --> 3283.88]  don't know I hope that works out quite
[3283.88 --> 3286.26]  well but we're not entirely sure and
[3286.26 --> 3288.14]  then one of the most exciting things of
[3288.14 --> 3291.06]  my week because anytime any news comes
[3291.06 --> 3294.42]  from mr. Elon Musk at all ever I get
[3294.42 --> 3296.74]  super excited there's more information
[3296.74 --> 3298.62]  about the Tesla Model D so all he
[3298.62 --> 3301.40]  released was a picture of like a garage
[3301.40 --> 3303.12]  door that was partially open and you
[3303.12 --> 3304.40]  could just kind of see like the
[3304.40 --> 3305.68]  headlights and a little bit of the
[3305.68 --> 3309.48]  front of the car but people are not
[3309.48 --> 3311.58]  entirely sure what it is it could be
[3311.58 --> 3315.76]  that cheap well cheap quote-unquote car
[3315.76 --> 3317.10]  that Tesla has been talking about for a
[3317.10 --> 3319.00]  little while or that might not be the
[3319.00 --> 3320.14]  reveal it could be something else
[3320.14 --> 3321.20]  completely different because they've
[3321.20 --> 3322.10]  already been talking about that a
[3322.10 --> 3323.48]  little bit people are unsure I
[3323.48 --> 3324.96]  personally think it's probably gonna be
[3324.96 --> 3326.22]  the cheap one yeah that they've been
[3326.22 --> 3327.70]  talking about especially because the
[3327.70 --> 3329.84]  front of the car looked like a car and
[3329.84 --> 3331.38]  not a different type of thing like an
[3331.38 --> 3333.78]  SUV yeah I saw some speculation oh maybe
[3333.78 --> 3336.40]  they'll unveil a truck but it looked too
[3336.40 --> 3339.32]  low yes look like a truck yeah it looked
[3339.32 --> 3343.24]  like a car so it's probably the cheaper
[3343.24 --> 3345.00]  version of a Tesla that they've been
[3345.00 --> 3346.64]  talking about for a little while and
[3346.64 --> 3348.00]  they've also said that there's other
[3348.00 --> 3350.00]  information coming soon which is
[3350.00 --> 3351.92]  probably talking about right by the way
[3351.92 --> 3354.18]  that was posted on the forum by
[3354.18 --> 3357.70]  Heisenblerg Heisenblerg thank you
[3357.70 --> 3360.86]  Heisenblerg and then this next topic
[3360.86 --> 3362.68]  which is Elon Musk saying that Tesla's
[3362.68 --> 3365.04]  will be able to self-drive 90% of the
[3365.04 --> 3367.24]  time was posted on the forum by Sherman
[3367.24 --> 3369.90]  tanker that's incredible that is okay
[3369.90 --> 3372.50]  sorry he hasn't said the date yet that's
[3372.50 --> 3375.18]  the incredible part uh what is it by
[3375.18 --> 3378.56]  2015 2015 coming early oh wait no model
[3378.56 --> 3380.56]  x is coming early 2015 so yeah sometime
[3380.56 --> 3383.78]  next year which is pretty insane and I
[3383.78 --> 3385.78]  love how smug he is about everything and
[3385.78 --> 3387.50]  then he just manages to do it that's my
[3387.50 --> 3389.18]  favorite part we're a Silicon Valley
[3389.18 --> 3391.04]  company so you know we're not leading
[3391.04 --> 3393.80]  the way then you know all is not right
[3393.80 --> 3396.44]  in the universe basically yeah because I
[3396.44 --> 3397.78]  mean it's not like other car
[3397.78 --> 3399.70]  manufacturers aren't talking about
[3399.70 --> 3401.88]  self-driving or excuse me as Musk calls
[3401.88 --> 3403.86]  it autopilot yeah which I personally
[3403.86 --> 3407.02]  think is way cooler oh yeah like a
[3407.02 --> 3409.96]  hundred self-driving car or car with
[3409.96 --> 3412.54]  autopilot badass yeah I want a car with
[3412.54 --> 3413.86]  autopilot it's not like other guys
[3413.86 --> 3415.82]  aren't talking about it GM's promised a
[3415.82 --> 3419.24]  hands-free mode for some 2017 models and
[3419.24 --> 3421.80]  most are speculating 2020 as a reasonable
[3421.80 --> 3423.72]  year for the release of self-driving cars
[3423.72 --> 3427.08]  I want autopilot cars Musk claims it's
[3427.08 --> 3430.32]  months away from retail for his 90%
[3430.32 --> 3432.74]  autopilot and some of the things that
[3432.74 --> 3434.04]  he's talking about that would be in the
[3434.04 --> 3438.12]  10% are stuff like difficult to manage
[3438.12 --> 3442.46]  like terrain right and like debris on the
[3442.46 --> 3444.62]  road it's not like they can't they can't
[3444.62 --> 3446.50]  just kind of cruise around right now it's
[3446.50 --> 3448.66]  it's the bad situations that you want
[3448.66 --> 3450.36]  your car to be able to handle can't
[3450.36 --> 3451.92]  necessarily handle and you know the
[3451.92 --> 3454.12]  funny thing about it is these things
[3454.12 --> 3456.64]  that self-driving or autopiloted cars
[3456.64 --> 3461.00]  have to overcome now are mostly to do
[3461.00 --> 3464.10]  with other drivers being hazards so they
[3464.10 --> 3468.06]  have to overcome this just to gain enough
[3468.06 --> 3470.32]  acceptance to eventually make it to a
[3470.32 --> 3472.64]  future where it doesn't matter because
[3472.64 --> 3474.48]  every other car on the road will behave
[3474.48 --> 3476.54]  in a predictable manner yeah but then
[3476.54 --> 3478.88]  there is other things bizarre and that is
[3478.88 --> 3480.60]  bizarre and you are completely correct but
[3480.60 --> 3482.40]  there is other reasons why they might have
[3482.40 --> 3485.16]  to be careful too if if a house falls over
[3485.16 --> 3487.26]  and there's debris in the road or if
[3487.26 --> 3488.94]  there's if there's some sort of rock
[3488.94 --> 3491.18]  fall adverse weather effects that are
[3491.18 --> 3493.94]  somehow unpredictable in some way yeah
[3493.94 --> 3495.86]  all these kinds of things yes it gets
[3495.86 --> 3498.40]  knocked over but those are much less
[3498.40 --> 3500.54]  frequent than some drunk dude crashing
[3500.54 --> 3503.04]  into a wall and making debris go all over
[3503.04 --> 3505.02]  the road so that is more what they have
[3505.02 --> 3507.76]  to take care of I know Elon Musk I I
[3507.76 --> 3509.30]  tweeted him a hilarious thing about
[3509.30 --> 3511.48]  wanting the D and I think half of the
[3511.48 --> 3513.66]  entire internet did as well and he
[3513.66 --> 3515.70]  replied the next day saying like oh the
[3515.70 --> 3517.02]  internet is hilarious that wasn't my
[3517.02 --> 3519.98]  intention I don't believe you at all
[3519.98 --> 3524.76]  that is such full cap yeah no no no
[3524.76 --> 3528.18]  because okay he wanted to release cars in
[3528.18 --> 3531.94]  the order of se and x because he thought
[3531.94 --> 3533.80]  that would be funny and then announcing
[3533.80 --> 3535.74]  like asking people if they want to know
[3535.74 --> 3540.72]  more about the D yeah so much innuendo
[3540.72 --> 3542.80]  there's no way that's not on that's
[3542.80 --> 3545.18]  not intentional so intentional oh my
[3545.18 --> 3546.74]  goodness I love it and that's hilarious
[3546.74 --> 3549.42]  and it's cool to see someone running one
[3549.42 --> 3551.62]  of these massive very important companies
[3551.62 --> 3554.18]  being able to like have a joke about
[3554.18 --> 3556.04]  these have a sense of humor about this
[3556.04 --> 3558.04]  stuff I mean why does product naming have
[3558.04 --> 3562.26]  to be so stuffy yeah you know have some
[3562.26 --> 3565.16]  fun with it I mean I'm sure that at least a
[3565.16 --> 3567.06]  handful of you have noticed that our
[3567.06 --> 3569.32]  secondary channel is called tech quickie
[3569.32 --> 3571.70]  and that our primary format is called
[3571.70 --> 3575.64]  fast as possible come on now more people
[3575.64 --> 3577.02]  have noticed you know the number of people
[3577.02 --> 3580.44]  who have pointed that out to me as if I
[3580.44 --> 3584.16]  didn't know by the way your channel is very
[3584.16 --> 3587.54]  like innuendo not sure if you do yeah
[3587.54 --> 3589.14]  I thought jokes on the WAN show sometimes
[3589.14 --> 3591.14]  I thought perhaps you didn't notice that
[3591.14 --> 3593.48]  did you know that fast as possible is an
[3593.48 --> 3599.66]  acronym for something else you know how
[3599.66 --> 3601.74]  long it came us to took us to come up
[3601.74 --> 3603.90]  with that name yeah eventually we found
[3603.90 --> 3605.64]  one that fit was like wow that's awesome
[3605.64 --> 3608.28]  and yeah with that yeah even tech quickie
[3608.28 --> 3611.16]  even tech quickie we we couldn't even find
[3611.16 --> 3613.12]  find a channel name that was available
[3613.12 --> 3615.36]  that we were happy with we actually bought
[3615.36 --> 3620.02]  tech quickie for a GTX 670 and a three
[3620.02 --> 3622.92]  terabyte hard drive I shipped it to some
[3622.92 --> 3625.32]  guy in Singapore and he transferred the
[3625.32 --> 3627.78]  channel to me that's hilarious yeah it
[3627.78 --> 3629.68]  actually had a bunch of videos on it so
[3629.68 --> 3631.12]  he transferred the channel to me I nuked
[3631.12 --> 3633.90]  them all we started over nice he wasn't
[3633.90 --> 3637.28]  gonna do the deal with me until he until
[3637.28 --> 3640.00]  he saw our primary channel and he was like
[3640.00 --> 3642.70]  oh yeah you guys are like you guys are
[3642.70 --> 3644.70]  pretty cool you guys do cool stuff you
[3644.70 --> 3647.18]  need this more than I do oh but I would
[3647.18 --> 3649.60]  definitely like some hardware I was like
[3649.60 --> 3653.16]  okay man sure dude you got this that's
[3653.16 --> 3654.62]  kind of cool I didn't actually know that
[3654.62 --> 3656.40]  story I knew we acquired it through some
[3656.40 --> 3657.78]  way and I knew we traded Howard but I
[3657.78 --> 3659.48]  didn't know like the whole yeah no he
[3659.48 --> 3661.12]  didn't even want to do it because it was
[3661.12 --> 3663.72]  actually tied to an email address that he
[3663.72 --> 3667.16]  used so he was like yeah I'm not using
[3667.16 --> 3669.44]  the YouTube channel but I'd really rather
[3669.44 --> 3672.26]  keep this and I kind of went dude please
[3672.26 --> 3674.56]  we've got big plans we've got stuff we
[3674.56 --> 3676.64]  want to do this is important yeah and he
[3676.64 --> 3678.80]  went yeah okay I wonder if every once in a
[3678.80 --> 3680.34]  while he like he checks back and goes like
[3680.34 --> 3683.94]  oh cool I don't know maybe heard from him at all or no not at all that's
[3683.94 --> 3687.14]  interesting yeah funny hey anyways I guess we
[3687.14 --> 3689.32]  can move on to like real yeah I want to
[3689.32 --> 3691.54]  thank Scott for coming on the show yeah
[3691.54 --> 3694.32]  great guest lots of great information I
[3694.32 --> 3695.94]  know that some of it might have been a
[3695.94 --> 3699.18]  little bit sort of higher level than some
[3699.18 --> 3700.50]  of the stuff that we normally talk about
[3700.50 --> 3704.64]  but guys Scott knows a ton and everything
[3704.64 --> 3706.86]  he said there was really great information
[3706.86 --> 3711.48]  he's one of the most trustworthy voices in
[3711.48 --> 3714.24]  the entire tech industry he's a true
[3714.24 --> 3716.88]  journalist he cares so much about the
[3716.88 --> 3719.28]  truth and the real information so you
[3719.28 --> 3720.82]  guys should definitely check out the tech
[3720.82 --> 3722.94]  report definitely pay attention to what
[3722.94 --> 3724.86]  Scott's doing especially if you were
[3724.86 --> 3727.68]  captivated by his presence here on our show
[3727.68 --> 3729.72]  he does have a podcast so you guys should
[3729.72 --> 3731.66]  check that out as well normally I would
[3731.66 --> 3733.54]  like for him to be able to outro himself
[3733.54 --> 3735.62]  but unfortunately our Skype connection was
[3735.62 --> 3738.08]  lost and we can't bring him back on so
[3738.08 --> 3740.98]  there you go guys big thanks to Scott for
[3740.98 --> 3742.62]  coming on the show today and we thought that
[3742.62 --> 3743.18]  was great
[3743.18 --> 3746.42]  yep that was actually absolutely fantastic
[3746.42 --> 3749.16]  was the PCI Express 4.0 conversation
[3749.16 --> 3751.92]  no mainstream no it wasn't on the
[3751.92 --> 3753.76]  mainstream yeah that was actually like my
[3753.76 --> 3756.10]  favorite part I know I wanted to just
[3756.10 --> 3758.50]  knowledge bombs in the middle of no way I
[3758.50 --> 3761.02]  know I wanted to bring him back I wanted
[3761.02 --> 3763.10]  to come back to that while we were actually
[3763.10 --> 3765.22]  live on the show so Scott was talking about
[3765.22 --> 3769.54]  PCI Express 4.0 which is basically we've
[3769.54 --> 3772.82]  reached the limit of of what can be achieved
[3772.82 --> 3776.40]  by connecting graphics cards to other things
[3776.40 --> 3780.62]  and in the system via copper and PCI Express 4.0 is
[3780.62 --> 3783.06]  going to be probably server only technology at
[3783.06 --> 3785.02]  least for quite some time because of how
[3785.02 --> 3787.70]  expensive it's going to be to implement with
[3787.70 --> 3791.84]  like repeaters and signal repeaters built into a
[3791.84 --> 3794.92]  motherboard just to get the signal far enough
[3794.92 --> 3796.74]  because yeah because they have to make it so
[3796.74 --> 3798.92]  ridiculously tight because to get bandwidth that
[3798.92 --> 3800.74]  fast over copper it has to be pretty short
[3800.74 --> 3803.18]  really really cool so he was talking about how
[3803.18 --> 3805.10]  they're gonna have to get into other technologies
[3805.10 --> 3807.24]  outside of copper and apparently they're already
[3807.24 --> 3809.74]  working on this and it's kind of maybe working
[3809.74 --> 3812.34]  kind of working yeah oh man that was actually a
[3812.34 --> 3813.82]  really interesting conversation that was my
[3813.82 --> 3815.74]  yeah my favorite part about him having him on
[3815.74 --> 3817.40]  the show was that and that's not on the main
[3817.40 --> 3820.80]  show unfortunate yeah don't worry we'll uh we'll
[3820.80 --> 3823.18]  we'll have him back at some point um Nexus
[3823.18 --> 3826.18]  six specs have been leaked so the original article
[3826.18 --> 3828.56]  here is from Android Police and this was posted on
[3828.56 --> 3831.02]  the forum by Top War Gamer thank you Top War Gamer for
[3831.02 --> 3833.30]  posting that let's go ahead and pop this up on the
[3833.30 --> 3837.50]  screen this is the Motorola Nexus 6 a 5.9 inch
[3837.50 --> 3841.40]  quad HD display with a 3200 milliamp hour plus
[3841.40 --> 3845.16]  battery dual front facing speakers and more and I
[3845.16 --> 3849.92]  hate it why it's a phablet oh yeah okay it's
[3849.92 --> 3856.16]  almost six inches yeah I mean I understand that no I
[3856.16 --> 3858.78]  don't understand this well how big is it I know it's not like
[3858.78 --> 3864.00]  I okay but how big is it I understand having a phablet in your
[3864.00 --> 3869.66]  product lineup yeah I get that but Google's Nexus line is the one
[3869.66 --> 3876.42]  phone that pardon the pun is supposed to be one size fits all and a phablet
[3876.42 --> 3881.76]  does not fit all like the D period oh no there's lots of different sizes of D's
[3881.76 --> 3889.04]  that are needed I was just yeah anyway I yeah so the the note 4 is kind of a huge
[3889.04 --> 3894.00]  phone and this is point two larger because the note 4 is 5.7 inches this is
[3894.00 --> 3899.58]  5.9 so this is extremely frustrating to me because I already find a 5 inch phone to
[3899.58 --> 3904.02]  be pretty much the limit for okay and I always used to play devil's advocate and
[3904.02 --> 3907.98]  say that I liked bigger phones like bigger hands or whatever but I actually
[3907.98 --> 3912.66]  really like this phone you've been using the Moto X and whenever I use bigger
[3912.66 --> 3916.20]  phones now I'm like you know what I can reach the other corner I don't want to
[3916.20 --> 3920.34]  have to reach for the other corner it's easier when I can just click on it and I
[3920.34 --> 3923.82]  know some people are gonna like destroy me for that but like it doesn't it
[3923.82 --> 3927.66]  doesn't matter I use my phone more for like production style stuff so I'm like
[3927.66 --> 3933.26]  like emails less content consumption stuff yeah I'm not watching videos on it
[3933.26 --> 3937.52]  really I'll listen to music doesn't matter having a huge screen for music
[3937.52 --> 3942.26]  because it just sits in my pocket so like I listen to music I read emails I
[3942.26 --> 3948.14]  read documents I type things up I reply to emails text messages phone calls that
[3948.14 --> 3950.84]  kind of stuff so I don't actually necessarily care about a huge screen
[3950.84 --> 3954.74]  anymore I used to because I used to game my phone a little bit right but I'm
[3954.74 --> 3960.00]  seeing so over gaming on my phone yeah and like especially with smash bros which is
[3960.00 --> 3963.14]  awesome I can actually talk about it now because it released this morning oh
[3963.14 --> 3968.24]  yeah we've been playing it for how long like two weeks so good the only
[3968.24 --> 3971.66]  unfortunate part was now that I actually had to go get my own copy because they
[3971.66 --> 3975.80]  get the review copy back it's all saved on the card oh so I lost all my
[3975.80 --> 3983.54]  progress go Nintendo but the
[3983.54 --> 3989.12]  stop that was a weird noise the Hyrule Warriors one it saves locally to your Wii U
[3989.12 --> 3993.04]  oh I had to get another copy of that but then I still have my save nice so I went
[3993.04 --> 3997.02]  further in that game and smash is more about just fighting so it's not that big
[3997.02 --> 4001.50]  of a deal but yeah tons of fun and I would way rather play that than something on my
[4001.50 --> 4006.10]  phone right so I just hold my 2ds with me and then everyone knows what a shield
[4006.10 --> 4010.98]  lover I am yeah so then you have the shield and like if if I didn't have a 2ds I
[4010.98 --> 4014.14]  would go with the shield I would not get with a phone with shield at 200 bucks
[4014.14 --> 4021.12]  that's a no-brainer for me yeah for a proper controller um yeah I don't know I
[4021.12 --> 4024.98]  mean I'm not really into phone gaming so I don't see the point I don't know I was
[4024.98 --> 4029.12]  happy when I first saw this before I saw the size because I was looking at stuff
[4029.12 --> 4032.76]  like oh okay so they brought forward-facing speakers that's cool they
[4032.76 --> 4035.76]  fixed the battery problem that's cool and then they have a lot of the other
[4035.76 --> 4040.48]  features that that the other Moto X would have yeah which is that's also cool yeah it's
[4040.48 --> 4044.44]  very similar to the new Moto X so it's got the same aluminum frame around the
[4044.44 --> 4049.22]  outside looks very similar other than being larger but ring flash a lot of the
[4049.22 --> 4052.42]  a lot of the innovations here aren't really that meaningful to me especially
[4052.42 --> 4058.72]  things like a quad HD display I reviewed the G3 there's a lot more to a display
[4058.72 --> 4064.42]  than resolution so much more there's a whole world of contrast and color
[4064.42 --> 4068.50]  reproduction out there that has nothing to do with how many pixels you can cram
[4068.50 --> 4071.80]  into a space and that's one thing I brought up in my note 4 video from CTIA
[4071.80 --> 4075.70]  was that they had an extremely high resolution display on the note 4 but
[4075.70 --> 4080.80]  they didn't sacrifice what it looked like right so the the color still looks
[4080.80 --> 4085.84]  really good which was not a thing on the G3 well that and because Samsung's
[4085.84 --> 4091.06]  gonna be using AMOLED they're not gonna lose contrast the way that the way that a
[4091.06 --> 4097.54]  typical LCD will like the the HTC 1 M8 is an LCD screen but it's got great
[4097.54 --> 4101.74]  contrast which makes it easier to use outside than the G3 in spite of all the
[4101.74 --> 4106.00]  pixels because its contrast ratio so the difference between the darkest darks and
[4106.00 --> 4110.92]  the whitest whites is not as high whereas AMOLED is able to turn the pixels
[4110.92 --> 4116.32]  right off when they're not being used so you'll typically have excellent contrast so
[4116.32 --> 4119.46]  that's why something like that is gonna work a little bit better and while you
[4119.46 --> 4122.64]  might not necessarily care about the high resolution on a note 4 because you're
[4122.64 --> 4125.28]  probably not gonna be able to know the difference if you get something like a
[4125.28 --> 4128.46]  gear VR you'll be able to tell the difference when it's right there in front
[4128.46 --> 4133.14]  of your face I'm kind of curious to try gear VR it's surprisingly good but there
[4133.14 --> 4136.38]  is also drawbacks have we talked about it on the show before yeah we have yeah okay so
[4136.38 --> 4139.92]  I'm not gonna dive into it much but I think it's gonna be retail available in not
[4139.92 --> 4143.10]  way too long so we might be able to try one out if we get a note 4 it's one phone
[4143.10 --> 4146.76]  compatible right now right they're hoping to open it up at some point but as of
[4146.76 --> 4149.94]  right now it's one phone compatible right all right so let's move into our
[4149.94 --> 4153.78]  sponsor spots here really quickly Squarespace is our first sponsor today
[4153.78 --> 4159.18]  guys visit squarespace.com slash Linus for a free trial and for 10% off use

[4164.10 --> 4168.18]  build your own website that other people can actually access and that doesn't
[4168.18 --> 4172.44]  look like but this is our first spot for them this month so we're announcing
[4172.44 --> 4178.20]  another Squarespace site giveaway guys tweet your Squarespace site to hashtag

[4188.16 --> 4192.24]  with your two-week free trial and then we go ahead and send your site to
[4192.24 --> 4196.32]  Squarespace and boom they activate it for a year their hosting options are
[4196.32 --> 4202.32]  scalable their templates look fantastic and they work on desktop laptop phone

[4218.76 --> 4223.20]  out more cost effective especially once your site starts to scale up and get
[4223.20 --> 4227.58]  more traffic to just host it through Squarespace versus trying to admit it
[4227.58 --> 4232.00]  yourself even if you paid yourself minimum wage to admin a website there's a lot that
[4232.00 --> 4235.68]  can go wrong with a website and our Squarespace site has been completely
[4235.68 --> 4239.68]  maintenance free for over a year partially because we've decided not to
[4239.68 --> 4244.00]  update it yeah we need to update it I think it has three employees under our
[4244.00 --> 4248.68]  team let's I actually know maybe we added Brandon to I think I think no I'm pretty
[4248.68 --> 4253.00]  sure Brandon's on here I think you've been uh Nick Nick's on there but next little
[4253.00 --> 4257.00]  disclaimer thing or his description is like two lines a new member of the team
[4257.00 --> 4260.68]  currently serving as a sales representative he's been with us for over six months now
[4260.68 --> 4262.68]  Nick coordinates pre-rolls
[4262.68 --> 4268.28]  wow I'm the worst description I think Ed must have written that I think you did
[4268.28 --> 4273.18]  probably okay then it doesn't have like all the other new people yeah so it doesn't
[4273.18 --> 4277.32]  have Taryn it doesn't have new Nick we have another Nick we should just put him
[4277.32 --> 4281.00]  under here as new Nick new Nick
[4281.00 --> 4287.88]  um all right so guys squarespace.com slash Linus for a free trial and 10% off use offer code Linus try it out
[4287.88 --> 4293.32]  and hashtag Linus Squarespace for a chance to win your Squarespace site also sponsoring the show today
[4293.32 --> 4299.80]  dollarshaveclub.com why do we like dollarshaveclub well because shaving is good he doesn't necessarily
[4299.80 --> 4305.32]  shave his face but man that doesn't mean he doesn't use razors I do yeah there you go yeah I definitely
[4305.32 --> 4309.16]  there's lots of things you can need to shave with dollar shave club and our new I didn't even get
[4309.16 --> 4316.12]  that right away that's pathetic and our new sort of innovative thing that dollar shave club never told
[4316.12 --> 4322.84]  us to say is even though they market to men pretty much exclusively like you look at their silly humor
[4322.84 --> 4328.28]  in their advertisements and you look at the kinds of podcasts that they're sponsoring they they look
[4328.28 --> 4334.52]  to be going after men is there any reason why ladies might not want a high quality razor delivered
[4334.52 --> 4340.52]  straight to their door once a month so we actually had a a viewer chime in after that stream when we
[4340.52 --> 4345.24]  brought up the lady thing yeah bring up that his girlfriend prefers his dollar shave club razors
[4345.24 --> 4351.00]  and now he uses them as well so we weren't even that far off base looking for a gift idea for the lady
[4351.00 --> 4358.28]  and looking for a way to not so subtly hint that she might need to do some trimming dollarshaveclub.com slash
[4358.28 --> 4364.12]  linus head over there and uh give the gift of getting yourself slapped in the face but then
[4364.12 --> 4369.96]  potentially it turning into something worthwhile later on down the road yes wow wow yeah I went there
[4370.76 --> 4378.36]  all right so this is really cool news most project aura modules will be hot swappable thanks to modified
[4378.36 --> 4386.12]  android l this was posted on techno buffalo we should have john back his baby must be quite a bit older now
[4386.12 --> 4391.00]  yeah yeah john john rettinger from techno buffalo he was one of the best guests we've ever had we gotta
[4391.00 --> 4396.36]  we gotta bring him back maybe when uh maybe when nexus 6 drops or something like that we'll bring him on to
[4396.36 --> 4401.32]  talk about it yeah I haven't checked with him so obviously no promises but he did say he'd come on the
[4401.32 --> 4408.28]  show again at some point but the coolest thing about this besides being able to swap you know cameras
[4408.28 --> 4417.00]  let's say for example you can swap the battery while it's running whoa it's like what what are they
[4417.00 --> 4422.76]  tesla okay you can't do it while it's running but you can do it very quickly on a tesla yes faster than
[4422.76 --> 4428.20]  you can fill up your car with gas but how cool is that okay it's actually pretty awesome so project
[4428.20 --> 4435.24]  aura i've gone from being extremely skeptical to being extremely hopeful to being extremely not interested
[4435.24 --> 4441.32]  because i was sure it was going to be very very low end stuff to being pretty interested again all
[4441.32 --> 4447.56]  of a sudden it's got it's got a little bit of onboard uh it's got a little bit of onboard power
[4447.56 --> 4455.16]  so you will actually be able to potentially mid-call swap battery packs for true continuous use and like
[4455.16 --> 4460.36]  i've had people that i work with in the past carry around multiple batteries with them with their phone
[4460.36 --> 4464.44]  they never actually plugged it this way this was one specific guy that i worked with he would always have
[4464.44 --> 4468.92]  two spare batteries with him at all points in time and the battery in his phone and he would never
[4468.92 --> 4473.16]  plug in his phone to charge if it was getting low he'd turn it off swap the battery out turn it back
[4473.16 --> 4477.96]  on and keep going just like that hey and he would just always charge his batteries so this phone will
[4477.96 --> 4483.08]  be perfect for him i know he won't get it because he works for his very specific company but this phone
[4483.08 --> 4489.16]  would have been perfect for him and i do know people that would like doing that as well because like when
[4489.16 --> 4494.20]  when uh there's there's that what is it commercial yeah there's a commercial going on right now where the
[4494.20 --> 4498.68]  the guy his boss calls him and he's on a golf course and his boss is yelling at him for
[4498.68 --> 4501.72]  something and the phone only has four percent battery left and it just dies during the call
[4501.72 --> 4507.32]  and he's like now i don't have a job anymore they had one of these yeah i'm sure that's going to be
[4507.32 --> 4513.80]  the the ad for it no no there is an ad right now oh where the guy loses his job while he's on a golf
[4513.80 --> 4517.64]  course because his phone dies no i just mean i'm sure that's going to be the ad for project r i'm sure
[4517.64 --> 4523.32]  that's going to be like exactly what they're going for i i think it's probably going to be
[4523.32 --> 4529.72]  it's going to be more about the google play type store that they currently envision for parts where
[4529.72 --> 4537.40]  you'll be able to shop lenses or shop processors or whatever else and just quickly and easily order
[4537.40 --> 4542.68]  new swappable parts for your project r phone i think it's incredibly cool and i'm now getting pretty
[4542.68 --> 4547.32]  excited that would be cool because one thing i'm worried about is taking my moto x with me to germany
[4548.44 --> 4558.04]  sorry um and not being it's not your mom is it no no employees oh okay bye thank you bye um
[4558.04 --> 4564.92]  is my pictures are going to suck right freaking camera's terrible right like it's it's not good
[4565.56 --> 4569.24]  it's specifically not good right and like i don't have it here you can borrow mine
[4570.60 --> 4573.80]  are you going to be using this i don't know if you look at the lens you might know why i was going
[4573.80 --> 4577.40]  to lend it to you oh yeah that's not good yeah i cracked the lens on my 1ma
[4577.64 --> 4582.76]  i contacted htc support so maybe i'll maybe i'll tweet my results but i'm contacting them just as
[4582.76 --> 4588.52]  a regular guy through the regular support channels and i'm going to see how they treat me um so far
[4588.52 --> 4594.68]  i'm a warning though i had i had one lady tell me that for sure it was going to be covered and then
[4594.68 --> 4599.00]  she wanted me to check with my carrier to see if they would deal with the rma for me first before
[4599.00 --> 4602.36]  calling them back and they'd escalate me and i kind of went well i didn't get the phone through my
[4602.36 --> 4606.68]  carrier so probably not my carrier wasn't interested so i called back and the second lady
[4606.68 --> 4611.24]  said we can't guarantee that it's going to be covered and you're going to have to pay to send
[4611.24 --> 4615.08]  the phone and i'm okay with paying to send the phone to their rma center that's pretty standard in
[4615.08 --> 4621.64]  the tech industry um but if they don't cover this cracked lens i'm going to be pretty not impressed
[4621.64 --> 4627.00]  because the only way that that lens could be cracked is if there's something bloody well wrong with it
[4627.00 --> 4633.48]  because the rest of it all around it absolutely perfect immaculate and this lens is fine it's a
[4633.48 --> 4639.40]  bit of a known issue that that main camera lens cover is uh is not that great there are things you
[4639.40 --> 4645.00]  can do if you use a very mild abrasive like toothpaste you can get the coating off of it that has been
[4645.00 --> 4651.16]  causing it to appear kind of scratchy and then it's fine and uh but but with it cracked obviously
[4651.16 --> 4656.84]  that ain't gonna help me much so let's see i it's kind of fun being a normal customer every once
[4656.84 --> 4662.20]  in a while for me and just seeing how people treat me um but yeah i was even thinking about
[4662.20 --> 4667.48]  possibly maybe getting that camera that austin will never stop talking about really anyone but
[4667.48 --> 4672.76]  i'm not going to because i don't want to spend that much money how much is it 800 bucks oh wow yeah
[4672.76 --> 4677.24]  you don't seem like the kind of person who i don't think you've spent 800 on anything since i met you
[4677.24 --> 4686.44]  other than your car no definitely not um yeah so i don't know
[4686.44 --> 4688.44]  he wants new computer hardware he just steals it
[4691.24 --> 4696.20]  people ask me if i get stuff from work and i'm like no i take stuff from work
[4702.60 --> 4710.60]  anyways um yes yeah oh well all right uh facebook is doing an about face
[4710.60 --> 4719.32]  on their real name policy so the this was posted my by mega zero on the forum and the original source
[4719.32 --> 4726.04]  is the wall street journal okay so let's go ahead and pop that on there there we go hopefully that'll
[4726.04 --> 4731.88]  load at some point which like okay i i find this slightly hilarious because while i feel bad for the
[4731.88 --> 4739.16]  people that had their names forcibly revealed i may or may not and people that i know may or may not
[4739.16 --> 4746.36]  have facebook accounts under their gamer tags that have existed for a very long time that have never
[4746.36 --> 4754.92]  been changed which last names with like first and last names that are definitely not real right but like
[4754.92 --> 4762.52]  not even real names well the issue here was that it seemed to be a um a person or group of people
[4762.52 --> 4769.72]  targeting drag queens and drag kings and reporting them okay so facebook because the tools are mostly
[4769.72 --> 4775.96]  automated just kind of went through and and forced all these people to submit library cards or gym
[4775.96 --> 4782.36]  memberships or whatever else to to validate their names and of course they couldn't because they go by
[4782.36 --> 4789.00]  let's say for example a stage name yeah that is not their real name legally and and so basically it
[4789.00 --> 4796.04]  was a targeted attack on these people forcing them to reveal their legal names and um that is why facebook
[4796.04 --> 4800.44]  is kind of going well hold on a second that's not really what we meant to do here and they're
[4800.44 --> 4806.68]  re-evaluating the policy saying well hold on a second what we were really trying to achieve is to have
[4806.68 --> 4812.28]  people use a name that they use in real life not necessarily that we wanted everyone
[4812.28 --> 4817.32]  to force forcibly reveal their legal name because honestly they want they want a name that they
[4817.32 --> 4822.20]  can target advertisements at yes that's what they want yeah that's all they care about yeah so they
[4822.20 --> 4826.04]  don't care about getting your real like government issued name but they want the name that you're using
[4826.04 --> 4829.96]  online so they can target ads to you that's right so they're not really trying to be oppressive in
[4829.96 --> 4836.12]  that way they just want to be able to it just happened yeah because automated tools yeah yeah
[4836.12 --> 4842.76]  reasons why people are scared about automated driving speaking of automated and facebook and
[4842.76 --> 4848.04]  scary uh facebook's developing giant unmanned planes that are designed to fly for months at a time this
[4848.04 --> 4854.04]  was posted by ethno on the forum thank you for that and the original article here is from the bbc
[4854.04 --> 4859.56]  so they're planning to have them fly above the weather which i believe is yeah 60 000 to 90 000 feet
[4859.56 --> 4865.24]  which is huge it's supposed to be about six or seven priuses in length i love how they're using
[4865.24 --> 4871.56]  this as a unit of measurement six or seven priuses in length which i believe is about two linuses so
[4871.56 --> 4878.84]  we're looking at about 12 to 14 12 to 14 linuses and then and then we're like about or about two school
[4878.84 --> 4889.40]  buses yeah there you go and uh where is it about the weight of four tires of a prius so weighs basically
[4889.40 --> 4895.08]  nothing wow that's incredible i think that's why like they're supposed to be solar powered for one
[4895.08 --> 4900.36]  which is insane that's that's incredible that's that is kind of incredible so i'm assuming if
[4900.36 --> 4905.16]  they're solar powered they're gonna have to be some type of uh propeller base because you're gonna have
[4905.16 --> 4911.80]  to move something instead of having a jet so that's interesting not entirely sure how they're gonna do that
[4911.80 --> 4915.40]  i don't think there's a ton of information about that yet not yet but it could be interesting they're
[4915.40 --> 4919.24]  planning on getting wi-fi to a whole bunch of different places in the world with the intent of
[4919.24 --> 4925.08]  totally not just advertising to even more people but getting more people online to help with uh just
[4925.08 --> 4929.64]  spread of information so you can get people out of poverty and help with child mortality and stuff
[4929.64 --> 4936.44]  like that yeah all all the stuff oh no all a lot of the stuff that's going to be achieved thanks to
[4936.44 --> 4941.64]  this initiative is going to be extremely positive oh yeah definitely not i was just kind of poking but
[4941.64 --> 4947.24]  i mean i think you know if we look at why facebook invests in anything are they ultimately after
[4948.04 --> 4952.92]  themselves and their own interests of course yes they're a company they're going to do that
[4952.92 --> 4957.56]  publicly traded company load no less they have to justify everything they do to shareholders
[4957.56 --> 4961.48]  yep so wait till the shareholders meeting and then you'll figure out why they're actually doing it
[4961.48 --> 4966.44]  yeah exactly but it will be overwhelmingly positive for a lot of people unless the internet access is
[4966.44 --> 4971.96]  only to facebook but i doubt that'll be a thing all right dayo 28 posted this on the forum and kano
[4971.96 --> 4979.80]  has evidently shipped their build learn to code computer kits to the first batch of backers we
[4979.80 --> 4985.48]  actually got one yeah so we did back it and um i'm actually gonna have luke probably do the review
[4985.48 --> 4990.28]  on this when he gets back but do you want to tell people a little bit about the kano either way before
[4990.28 --> 4996.36]  i get people into it i'm gonna have you as part of the video because part of the idea is that it's supposed
[4996.36 --> 5002.52]  to take uh hacking around with code and learning uh computational thinking child's play not that's
[5002.52 --> 5006.76]  that's just kind of so i'm a child words no it's supposed to make it easier and it's supposed to
[5006.76 --> 5010.84]  make it easier to understand and just having instead of just having it be raw code all over the place
[5010.84 --> 5017.00]  yeah there'll be examples and it'll build you up you'll learn as you as you play with it and i want
[5017.00 --> 5023.88]  you to try it as someone who hasn't programmed just to see how the how the like barrier of entry is so
[5023.88 --> 5028.12]  we'll get both perspectives yeah because the barrier of entry to coding can be brutal for a
[5028.12 --> 5032.68]  lot of people and then once you start rolling it's a lot easier but the barrier of entry sucks and a big
[5032.68 --> 5037.96]  part of this project is to lower or lessen that barrier of entry so it should be pretty interesting
[5037.96 --> 5043.80]  but it's essentially a little raspberry pi single board linux-based computer that has some of their
[5043.80 --> 5048.44]  software on it which helps teach you how to code it's not the most super complicated thing but it is a
[5048.44 --> 5053.72]  very cheap way to get into programming and it can essentially build you up a whole computer you just
[5053.72 --> 5058.60]  have to add like a screen stuff yep they're going to get into modular components at some point in
[5058.60 --> 5062.76]  the future here screens battery sensors lights robotics and all kinds of stuff like that so
[5063.56 --> 5068.84]  the future looks pretty bright for these guys they actually just brought in uh the former ceo of match
[5068.84 --> 5072.92]  dot com as their chief operating officer yeah i think right now it comes with a keyboard right
[5072.92 --> 5076.92]  keyboard a little touchpad on it i think so all you need to do is hook it up to a screen so if you
[5076.92 --> 5082.36]  walk around with this thing you could have the the power brick and the little keyboard and the mini raspberry
[5082.36 --> 5085.40]  power unit you just have to hook it up to a screen you're good to go anywhere which is actually
[5085.40 --> 5093.48]  pretty cool all right so i think we've got uh probably a couple more a couple more topics here
[5093.48 --> 5099.40]  and then we might just have to wrap things up sure what do you think is next ea finally fixed battlefield
[5099.40 --> 5105.24]  four and apparently they're releasing some stuff to sims like pools which probably should have been
[5105.24 --> 5108.76]  there in the in the beginning but they're not charging people for it which a lot of people were
[5108.76 --> 5114.92]  expecting so you're getting uh swimming pools ghosts and star wars themed content along with
[5114.92 --> 5121.00]  some new careers paths and all that should be free cool which i don't necessarily care about but we did
[5121.00 --> 5125.80]  hammer them for that so we should have that positive so we should we should be nice when they
[5125.80 --> 5130.92]  do good things we should all righty yay we'll be nice but ubisoft we're still mad at you
[5130.92 --> 5139.00]  yeah you didn't make shadows of mordor yeah i'm really excited to play it the i've seen some
[5139.00 --> 5143.96]  complaints about the combat still being kind of simplistic but i wanted i want to really play
[5143.96 --> 5148.68]  it for myself before i before i judge it here uh there's a good post on the forum comparing it to
[5148.68 --> 5155.40]  the batman series um especially the combat saying it's just not as deep and it's very frustrating to
[5155.40 --> 5162.36]  play without uh telegraph attack indicators yeah because the the telegraphs are not as clear and it
[5162.36 --> 5167.96]  ends up a lot of the time just being a cluster hump of of bad dudes around you and it's kind of hard to
[5167.96 --> 5175.16]  manage and then playing with telegraphs on pretty easy so yeah that makes sense i i you played the
[5175.16 --> 5180.44]  batman batman series a lot more thoroughly than i did so you'll probably have more input on that side
[5180.44 --> 5186.52]  yeah i barely touched the batman series so i won't really even know um i know when i play i'm
[5186.52 --> 5192.36]  gonna try and play with a little telegraph things but i'm probably gonna get murdered but i don't
[5192.36 --> 5197.56]  necessarily mind dying in games right as long as it's possible for me to keep progressing yeah i'm okay
[5197.56 --> 5203.64]  as long as it's fair yeah yeah make it fair i mean not like warcraft 2 where you would play a 1v1
[5203.64 --> 5209.56]  against a computer on an eight player map and then if you watch the replay or just turn off fog of war
[5209.56 --> 5215.72]  with a cheat you could watch their first soldier or grunt walk straight to your base it's like
[5216.60 --> 5223.32]  come on at least search like at least try to search at least pretend to like hard code it in so they
[5223.32 --> 5228.68]  look in one place that you're not before so so you always knew you had to build one guard tower
[5229.16 --> 5233.88]  before anything else so that you could deal with that stupid first and second attack
[5233.88 --> 5239.88]  kind of brutal yeah so i don't know i'll probably try it the hard way just because it sounds kind of
[5239.88 --> 5244.60]  fun and the combat does seem pretty simplistic so far and removing that will make the combat not
[5244.60 --> 5249.32]  simplistic at all so i don't know we'll see all right well i think that's pretty much it for the
[5249.32 --> 5255.72]  show here today guys um thank you for watching again big thanks to scott for being our guest big
[5255.72 --> 5262.04]  thanks to squarespace for being our sponsor and dollar shave club for being our other sponsor and uh we'll see
[5262.04 --> 5268.04]  you guys again next week um don't worry we know what's causing the conduct connectivity problems
[5268.04 --> 5274.28]  and we will get that resolved before the show next week so stay tuned for that thanks for watching and
[5274.28 --> 5279.40]  if you missed any of the show today the whole thing uninterrupted will be up in the archive on youtube
[5284.92 --> 5286.68]  oh whoops dang it
[5292.04 --> 5316.52]  oh there's a lot of people asking about the one million subscriber giveaway that's already been
[5316.52 --> 5322.36]  announced and the winners are linked under last week's land show that's that's done i've actually
[5322.36 --> 5328.92]  got the uh the the gaming notebook sitting at ncix ready to ship out to the winner so yeah good stuff
[5328.92 --> 5332.92]  hooray all right see you guys
