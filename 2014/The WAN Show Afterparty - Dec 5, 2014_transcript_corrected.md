[0.00 → 6.16] I also really like that Facebook has given us an official verified page
[6.16 → 11.76] whoa now that was a while ago Twitter apparently reserves it for like people
[11.76 → 16.44] that their employees notice yeah that's pretty much it is like I know people that
[16.44 → 21.68] are verified that have like 2,000 followers yep yeah at Twitter there
[21.68 → 25.44] doesn't appear to be any kind of actual procedure for it nope yeah I knew that
[25.44 → 30.24] yeah so like if one of their followers knows some dude, and he's like oh yeah
[30.24 → 35.76] that's you okay like that's honestly one of the ways that you can get verified the
[35.76 → 41.10] official policy is that aside from being like basically people who are at risk of
[41.10 → 46.26] being impersonated, and I would argue that anyone you have been I'm sorry
[46.26 → 50.40] considering we have yeah I've reported plenty of impersonation on Twitter and
[50.40 → 54.90] they don't care and then one of the other things is you have to use the social
[54.90 → 60.12] platform correctly like in the way like first so Twitter is linked to other
[60.12 → 63.78] social platforms maybe that's part of the issue
[63.78 → 68.82] yeah we know why because Twitter is supposed to be about stream of
[68.82 → 73.08] consciousness so like what I'm doing right now whereas I don't do that I
[73.08 → 78.36] don't really do that whenever I think you're like terrible jokes they go on
[78.36 → 90.12] Twitter and whatever I'm like complaining about something like my favourite Twitter
[90.12 → 96.00] posts that I do are the ones where I'm having where I'm having like some random
[96.00 → 101.16] conversation with Yvonne, and she burns me, or I burn her like those are
[101.16 → 105.96] my favourites by far because it's just like yeah that happens yes I'm that
[105.96 → 114.54] awful and yes she's that awful and that's our life together we don't have
[114.54 → 120.10] to do it anymore okay did they just kill it or what I am essentially okay that's
[120.10 → 125.04] fine so I think I'm not allowed to go shirtless on twitch so hopefully this nip
[125.04 → 129.54] slip here is not a big deal if I'm using it to change into a twitch shirt I think it's
[129.54 → 132.66] can I get away with it, I think it technically is a big deal because
[132.66 → 136.30] they're going with the like yeah I know guys can't do it either thing right
[136.30 → 143.10] which is probably fair party bought which doesn't exist okay now hold on a second
[143.10 → 149.78] because I saw a lot of I saw a lot of discussion about guys streaming shirtless
[149.78 → 155.22] and girls streaming with like just cleavage hanging out all over the place
[155.22 → 163.10] what if a guy streamed with cleavage hanging out all over the place so a v-neck yeah like a super
[163.10 → 171.62] low-cut v-neck on a dude is that considered erotic to anyone I don't know to women like if there are
[171.62 → 178.86] any women watching I'm sure it's erotic to someone it might be yeah I need to know like if the dudes fit
[178.86 → 184.54] I'm sure it's erotic yeah but like what if it's a fairly tight-fitting shirt and the dudes fit maybe
[184.54 → 190.18] it looks okay well tell me this like does it have to you know does it have to be in because is it okay
[190.18 → 195.14] is it an intention thing or what you're actually doing like if your intention is to be kind of gross
[195.14 → 201.92] hard to like if you put on a chest toupee like 70s style chest toupee and wear a v-neck the chest hair
[201.92 → 206.78] yeah like is that still considered attractive I don't know are you obviously
[206.78 → 211.16] just trying to be gross, and I don't think it's a matter of what's attractive it's a matter of what
[211.16 → 217.62] they consider decent yeah I've got people saying that v-neck looks stupid I know it's not the point
[217.62 → 223.98] the conversation we're having um like I think certain v-necks are fine I don't like the like
[223.98 → 231.28] super low ones I actually prefer the shirts where it's a very shallow v-neck just because I like that
[231.28 → 236.60] next one more all right brookla says anything is going to be erotic to someone and this is a very
[236.60 → 246.76] good point um McDade says or mike dude says uh why are people such prudes well because someone else
[246.76 → 254.36] who complains really loudly is an even bigger prude and the prudes because the internet is like
[254.36 → 260.66] mainstream now yeah I mean and I know what I kind of get it like if you're trying to maintain a
[260.66 → 266.02] somewhat professional website you don't want like shirtless dudes yeah you don't want cleavage and
[266.02 → 271.72] shirtless dudes everywhere because that's not professional and that's not you can call it prude or
[271.72 → 276.44] you can call it whatever you want but it what it isn't is professional you know it's the classic no
[276.44 → 282.70] shirt no shoes no service that's the way the world works and what about no pants yeah like there are
[282.70 → 290.20] plenty of websites that are not twitch where you can go to look at boobs in streams so yeah
[290.20 → 296.86] live streams either or or or presumably having not looked into this I wouldn't be an expert on it
[296.86 → 304.26] presumably not boobs in streams so apparently Linus and Luke should do a WAN show in latex
[304.26 → 309.66] I will be doing an uh a body paint upper body episode soon that shipped by the way
[309.66 → 314.72] so okay yeah so it's not here yet have we figured out my costume for the girls' thing
[314.72 → 323.10] is it showing up yeah if you don't get the things to then just go to uh let's go to the shop there
[323.10 → 326.98] that's what I was going to do to get the things yeah yeah just don't want to wait two weeks for damn
[326.98 → 333.16] Amazon yeah well it's Christmas season who knows if it'll even show up until after Christmas we're
[333.16 → 339.00] already in December yeah we're going to have to get it locally apparently people are saying yet twitch
[339.00 → 345.94] has instar-partnered with known porn stars okay you could but twitch would probably instar-partner with
[345.94 → 351.40] any highly recognizable person as long as they're using the site within the guidelines yeah who cares if
[351.40 → 356.52] they're a porn star yeah I don't see why that matters not really relevant yeah pretty much
[356.52 → 362.56] um twitch states that they want to keep the website about the games and not what people are or are not
[362.56 → 370.90] wearing and yeah I totally get that twitch doesn't need to be you know live cams RS central I mean yes
[370.90 → 377.06] they're live and there are cameras involved I think you know what I meant yes let's keep it gaming
[377.06 → 383.16] focused right guys apparently I shouldn't get glossy body paint it's worse to remove thank you for the
[383.16 → 389.84] pro tip I already bought it I have no idea what kind it is I'm not a body paint expert nobody
[389.84 → 394.98] chocolate on the other hand I could probably tell you guys a thing or two industrial fondues
[394.98 → 404.20] yeah fondues body chocolate fondues for cucumbers would chocolate cucumber be good probably not
[404.20 → 409.02] probably not no chocolate doesn't go with everything what are we even talking about
[409.02 → 415.98] yeah it's like water and water yeah chocolate rain
[415.98 → 421.94] we're saying I should bust when you're talking about me singing or whatever they're like
[421.94 → 426.34] nick bust into the room I was like chocolate rain I was hoping you were going to do something like it
[426.34 → 431.54] doesn't matter, but that's why I yelled your name oh, oh you yelled my name yeah I didn't say that
[431.54 → 435.72] loud because I didn't want it to peak the mic I was like half listening for the sponsor spots
[435.72 → 439.14] yeah yeah apparently it would be watery yeah it would be watery
[439.14 → 447.78] this was a heck of a week so we released oil cool part three we released curved surround part two
[447.78 → 454.04] the final one of that for something and tomorrow actually the number of people who were
[454.04 → 462.72] butt hurt at you about saying maybe we're going to have so many oh men yeah that is a butt hurt fist
[462.72 → 477.58] um I almost shortened it but I was like no yeah okay so anyway he was just teasing
[477.58 → 484.00] and not just teasing like teasing upcoming content just teasing it is coming out tomorrow night so
[484.00 → 491.22] tomorrow night whole room water cooling part one will be up and I cannot hype this video enough I think
[491.22 → 494.62] I've heard him say offline behind camera that he thinks it might be one of the best things we've
[494.62 → 498.82] ever made I think it might be the best thing we've ever made ed still says don't hype it up too much
[498.82 → 504.00] yeah ed says not to hype it, but he's done a great job of it and I thought we're a hype machine
[504.00 → 509.54] yeah I thought it was great hopefully we don't Ubisoft this hopefully it's actually great yeah it
[509.54 → 514.12] better be it is great you haven't seen it yet right no oh yeah it's its done it's done it's
[514.12 → 519.28] uploaded it would have been awesome if he had Ubisoft it and like she's coming in just like eyes and mouth
[519.28 → 522.52] bring air on minus his face for like one frame
[522.52 → 530.34] that would actually be pretty funny so I can't promise how quickly the additional episodes are
[530.34 → 536.06] coming, but we have all the footage we need for episodes two and three they're just extremely
[536.06 → 541.62] time-consuming to make, and we still need VO for two, and we still need voiceovers uh for some of them
[541.62 → 549.64] and then it's not strictly speaking done because not only did we never finish some things like the
[549.64 → 554.18] vinyl decals on the wall stuff didn't we or something happened no, no no, no no um, but we've
[554.18 → 558.54] had we had some challenges with putting quick disconnect fittings on all the systems so we have
[558.54 → 564.64] to finish off all the systems so they can actually be disconnected from the whole room loop um and then
[564.64 → 569.24] we still have to put some vinyl decals on the wall and the power supply for the fans for the roof
[569.24 → 575.42] mounted radiator died after like a couple of days because it was just some cheapo like it doesn't
[575.42 → 581.04] matter made in China like yeah but the cool thing about it, and maybe we'll cover this in more depth
[581.04 → 586.78] in the video is it's working without fans yeah yeah yeah one thing okay I didn't realize that there was
[586.78 → 592.52] like cool decals and stuff inside the box of the loot crate thing and the outside is like super plain
[592.52 → 600.12] and the inside's like cool stuff anyway oh can you like did he did oh that's really look how tightly packed
[600.12 → 603.88] everything is and I was like does it unfold and become something that's what I was wondering because
[603.88 → 609.64] you can see inside the fold oh it totally does yeah there's a cut line here oh what does it do
[610.60 → 617.88] share document enjoy I don't know because there's stuff under these folds in there you can see yeah here we
[617.88 → 623.32] should we should discover it while I'm talking but um like you're talking about putting the extra
[623.32 → 628.76] vinyls and stuff on the wall like aren't we moving soon I've got people asking for please don't please more
[628.76 → 634.52] nips please more nips yeah not, not today but I won't promise it'll never happen which is going to ban us
[634.52 → 640.92] yeah twitch is gonna I'll get banned while i rep my twitch shirt oh my god I think there's other stuff in
[640.92 → 647.80] here did we not even notice all the stuff way to go Lou hey man you were looking at it too are you a
[647.80 → 652.60] pirate or a ninja what does this say this month's theme is battle oh it has like a whole little
[652.60 → 658.44] like thing that goes along with it and there's like there's like little mega man and like BYU like
[658.44 → 665.56] pop out dudes that you can stand up and oh, and maybe it's something to do is oh my goodness I get it
[665.56 → 672.84] I get it oh that's so sick it's a fight background oh nice so you put your little like dudes and they
[672.84 → 677.96] like stand on it oh I totally get it that's awesome I can't believe we missed this we're going to pay a
[677.96 → 685.16] lot more attention to that kind of stuff yeah, and they screwed up the first one spot there's a freaking
[685.16 → 692.60] street fighter arcade edition full game oh there's a game code oh I don't want to show that there's a game
[692.60 → 702.44] code in here I'll show it like this there's a game code free game download street fighter 4 arcade
[702.44 → 708.28] this like folds out like way bigger than I originally showed it so fair this was supposed
[708.28 → 713.48] to be an unboxing spot so I don't think they expected you to like to get it perfect all of these
[713.48 → 718.68] things well they probably expected us to find the stuff that was in the box when I saw the paper stuff
[718.68 → 726.04] I was like oh it's just ads, and it's none of its ads yeah literally none of it is ads uh 50 off like
[726.04 → 733.64] that's a pretty big discount I wouldn't consider that an ad that's cool huh so I wonder how much
[733.64 → 739.00] street, and we suck is on steam it's probably like I don't think it's that expensive is it 20 bucks
[739.00 → 745.16] 20 dollars shut up 20 value free game download so you pay 1337 you get all that cool stuff and you
[745.16 → 751.32] get a 20 dollar game yeah that's pretty insane yeah, but you're a sales guy so we can't listen to you
[751.32 → 760.60] yeah IEEE ew business yeah all right I thought you were checking on steam I want to see if it's
[760.60 → 764.04] actually 20 dollars because like it is might have been 20 dollars when they printed those, and it might
[764.04 → 770.92] be like two dollars now we'll see steam I'm I would check but I'm waiting for my uh my text to input
[770.92 → 777.08] really yeah I was it's its loaded now I'm going to find it before your Wi-Fi is so much better than
[777.08 → 784.28] mega Rex what hot spot it's 30 dollars it's 30 bucks oh my god it's 29.99 we're in Canada so maybe
[784.28 → 790.60] it's like maybe it's 1999 in the US interesting um I already got an email from our rep back just being
[790.60 → 796.20] like my team told me we're seeing a lot of awesome traffic to the site okay cool so apparently I screw
[796.20 → 800.84] everything up and I still succeed well seriously when I saw the papers in the bottom I was like
[800.84 → 805.96] oh here's junk, and then it's like all awesome everyone who's still in the stream go over and
[805.96 → 811.88] check it out non-arcade edition I think is 20 bucks so they screwed up they screwed up, and they put it
[811.88 → 821.64] to 20 value, but it's the arcade edition oh this is ultra sorry wait what ultra oh is this ultra
[822.84 → 829.08] that's the arcade edition can buy this oh I get it I'm looking at ultra I might be looking at the wrong
[829.08 → 834.20] thing oh yeah yeah I think arcade edition is like the version before ultra it is you don't have one
[834.20 → 840.04] of the expansions or whatever yeah okay, okay so where's our key edition I don't know if you can buy
[840.04 → 847.16] it I don't know it's still street fighter 4. there's like 18 versions of street yeah I just figured that
[847.16 → 852.76] out that's super weird ultra mega wait we can't use mega that's mega man and there's also mega man swag
[852.76 → 860.44] ultra super, super mega man helmet man that thing's cool like I'm a huge mega man so mega buster yeah
[860.44 → 866.44] and it's like not, not super cheap and crappy either oh it's not in the box like it's fairly
[866.44 → 872.44] well constructed oh that's cool wow yeah that's actually having some weight to it yeah here's the stand
[872.44 → 879.72] okay well I'm going to go home and eat yay it's been a really long day do you want to go get food
[882.52 → 888.84] do you want to go get food maybe let me check with the family yeah should we go to the place yeah
[889.64 → 894.04] do the stuff and then I'll stream after I'm streaming tonight for anyone who's wondering should we should
[894.04 → 899.88] we stream lobbied instances I don't know someone asks when will Linus read the comments
[899.88 → 907.40] I love those questions I love those like you never answer any of my tweets that's my favourite
[907.40 → 912.44] tweet to ever see um it's like well I'm answering this one not sure what you wanted to know
[913.96 → 923.00] this is the one I happened to see people are asking for vlogs no man no dude no bro I do vlogs
[923.00 → 928.76] vlogs of what I do vlogs whenever I do something that I think is particularly interesting vlogs of what
[928.76 → 933.88] probably have like moving vlogs and like yeah we'll probably do moving vlogs yeah well I think
[933.88 → 937.88] some of that could be interesting yeah how we plan to set up like the editor's room and stuff could we
[937.88 → 943.56] actually be cool breaking certain things and networking new things and yeah networking's gonna
[943.56 → 949.32] be really cool yeah um you might be getting that thing that you're talking about the switch we've
[949.32 → 954.60] basically which switch you weren't you expressed interest a while back in a 10 gigabit switch
[954.60 → 960.84] yeah um it's not that unaffordable anymore i was shopping a little while ago and I think um net
[960.84 → 968.60] gear has a 12 port 10 gigabit Ethernet so like a rj45 switch for 900 or something along those lines so
[968.60 → 977.00] we could go 10 gigs at every editing station and uh to like a 20 gig backbone between the main switch and
[977.00 → 981.80] the server and I'm interested in who knows if we're going to do that really depends on what's available in
[981.80 → 985.96] the area but I'm interested in a load balancing appliance if we have to go that route because
[985.96 → 990.84] as far as I've been able to tell so far internet in that area is not great I'm assuming it's because
[991.72 → 1000.52] various companies that have warehouses aren't super worried about superfast internet yeah yeah I'm I'm
[1000.52 → 1004.76] hoping we can get something that's at least a touch better than what we have here and if we can't then
[1004.76 → 1012.76] we'll just have to live with it probably not yeah here keep all this stuff with the loot crate okay
[1012.76 → 1018.84] I'll just you know put it on my desk yeah dude since you guys steal my office to do this show yeah dude
[1019.96 → 1026.28] halo drop-ship minifigure he doesn't even care I'm just going to ignore that yeah
[1026.28 → 1033.72] so it like explains everything what does that say um I think this is ads this is that okay, but it's
[1033.72 → 1040.28] not all ads yeah this is cool uh like an article about halo or something I like articles I miss
[1040.28 → 1044.68] reading things about games I miss old gaming magazines there's like an interview about uh
[1044.68 → 1049.64] assassin's creed from yeah with the creators of assassin's creed, and you know what I've been doing a
[1049.64 → 1054.44] little bit more research on assassin's creed I'm still staying away from it for now um unity you mean yes
[1054.44 → 1060.12] sorry um but knowing me I'll play it eventually but my whole thing that I've been doing a little
[1060.12 → 1066.60] bit research on is um like what the actual game is about not the performance issues because I have
[1066.60 → 1072.68] a feeling they'll eventually iron out the performance issues enough that it's somewhat playable um and
[1072.68 → 1078.36] apparently the game by itself is actually pretty damn good and especially the environments and art and
[1078.36 → 1082.04] stuff in the game is perfect if you can freaking run it you hear the next one's in right
[1082.04 → 1085.96] or in London yeah I heard that that leaked we should have talked about that on the show yeah
[1086.52 → 1092.04] it was in there I need to spend a little bit more time on uh on narrowing down the topics for
[1092.04 → 1097.48] the show I think because um this week was kind of a mess this week was kind of all over the place
[1098.28 → 1104.20] the entire workflow this week was kind of oh I know this week was a total disaster for everyone
[1104.20 → 1108.76] watching this is more of an internal discussion but you guys can hear about it if you want yeah I burned
[1108.76 → 1115.64] probably 20 hours on the video that's coming out Sunday night um I burned the majority of Monday
[1115.64 → 1120.76] just handing badges out and like the one that's coming out Sunday night I don't even know how many
[1120.76 → 1125.32] of you are going to be interested in if it's a video about a thousand dollar wireless access point
[1125.96 → 1134.76] um and basically my original plan I had this like amazing plan to like he just got through some
[1134.76 → 1141.24] glitch in someone's system evidently um uh Merck access point it wasn't the glitch I know it wasn't
[1141.24 → 1146.28] a glitch but I'm sure they didn't intend for you to have one so whatever you want to call it he got
[1146.28 → 1153.96] maybe not, but it wasn't the glitch he got like a 700 Merck like enterprise grade cloud managed access
[1153.96 → 1159.00] point I recently got this thousand dollar ruckus one and then I was going to take some high-end consumer
[1159.00 → 1166.04] grade stuff and I was going to like go full-on Wi-Fi testing and like I had so many issues with
[1166.04 → 1172.28] it that Wi-Fi testing is redone you I already knew that but I learned it's more I did learn a lot
[1172.28 → 1177.56] and I have a methodology now that I think I could make work quite easily in the future but I need
[1178.20 → 1182.44] sorry I saw you running around doing stuff that made a lot of sense yeahs i need different gear
[1182.44 → 1187.80] for it though and this is going to come as a bit of a sort of shocker I think I need a MacBook Pro
[1187.80 → 1195.40] yeah because MacBook Pro is the only laptop that I'm aware of that has three spatial stream ac wireless
[1195.40 → 1203.00] and so for me to actually get the most out of a three spatial stream ac wireless access point i need
[1203.00 → 1209.64] a client that I can move around easily to different locations to do range and obstacle testing so instead
[1209.64 → 1214.44] I had to use a phone so I used the droid turbo because that's the one that holds the record for me
[1214.44 → 1222.04] for at my house I have 100 megabits down uh internet and on n wireless that's the one that does the
[1222.04 → 1228.44] the best throughput with um with the thousand dollar ap so that's the one that I decided to use for my testing
[1228.44 → 1235.40] I learned a lot about using IPER in the best possible way, but there's still a lot more that needs to be done
[1235.40 → 1240.84] like the problem with IPER and the problem I was running into with my testing is I had to basically wait for a run
[1240.84 → 1247.24] where I was kind of getting consistent results because like a car would go by yeah um where's
[1247.24 → 1253.56] the way speed test works like speedtest.net is it throws away the outliers at the top and the bottom
[1253.56 → 1259.32] in order to give you that number of this is your typical speed whereas IPER unless you've got uh like
[1259.32 → 1264.28] something like and I haven't tried opera yet but I will just as part of the learning process next time i
[1264.28 → 1269.24] tackle this if I do the problem with IPER is it just gives you a raw average of however long you
[1269.24 → 1275.00] run the test and i to my knowledge there isn't an easy way to export it at least from the phone
[1275.00 → 1282.28] version that I'm using yeah so I need a better client hardware I need a better client software layer
[1282.28 → 1286.52] so that I can draw more meaningful results from it but I was able to get something that
[1286.52 → 1293.08] is somewhat meaningful especially in my load testing so wireless access points are not just about max
[1293.08 → 1297.08] speed from the access point to one client because that's not how anybody uses them nope, and they're
[1297.08 → 1302.76] not about maximum range either because it's its relevant, but it's not necessarily how most people
[1302.76 → 1310.28] use them so I did a load test so like a stress test where i I think I ended up with six or seven clients
[1310.92 → 1319.64] all of which were streaming video or some other kind of super intensive content use um and then i basically
[1319.64 → 1326.68] tried to bring um the enterprise grade one and then a consumer grade one um to their knees and see
[1326.68 → 1331.88] how they held up, and the enterprise one is just if it costs three times as much as the consumer grade one
[1331.88 → 1337.24] it more than justifies its price in that use case scenario but what they said a lot of people won't have
[1337.24 → 1343.88] it in that use case scenario yes so if you had an um like if you had an extremely busy household where lots
[1343.88 → 1349.00] of people are running off wireless it could make a lot of sense, or it could completely not because you
[1349.00 → 1354.04] might be better off getting a lot of more inexpensive consumer grade access points and then positioning
[1354.04 → 1361.16] them all over the place so if you want like a blanket of wireless over the entire building that can handle
[1361.16 → 1367.40] seemingly unlimited load like this thing is awesome than enterprise grade well the they are we calling it
[1367.40 → 1374.68] what ap we're talking about yeah it's the r700 yeah okay so that exact model ap is what um a mutual
[1374.68 → 1380.76] friend of nick and I uses he's an manager at a school I'm trying to be as vague as possible he uses
[1380.76 → 1386.84] r700s all over the place and for the entire school with all these kids hammering it all day they're fine
[1387.40 → 1392.36] yeah so like I knew before you started doing this testing I was like the r700 is going to smash what was it
[1392.36 → 1398.44] you were you were hoping i was hoping that the Cisco Merck would do better
[1398.44 → 1407.64] than the r700 so that I could trade and then because somehow I wasn't going to figure out that the r700
[1407.64 → 1412.92] is better than the Merck well I was like if he goes through his raw testing, and it like wins in
[1412.92 → 1418.76] whatever scenarios he's doing then wouldn't you be happy with it why did you want the ruckus
[1418.76 → 1425.80] is there something you know that I don't about it uh it's a little bit i I like the localized
[1425.80 → 1431.72] manageability I don't I don't like the cloud stuff that Cisco Merck is doing uh I find it more simple
[1431.72 → 1438.60] because I find the Cisco Merck interface is designed around someone in a use case more like our mutual
[1438.60 → 1444.44] friends where they're running a bunch of these ap's I want one all the main menus are like here's your
[1444.44 → 1448.28] google map style map plot all the points where your ap's are I'm like I don't have
[1448.28 → 1455.40] a campus I have one small basement suite like I don't need this I just want to manage it and like
[1455.40 → 1460.36] if you're having some problem or if I'm offline for whatever reason I still want to be able to access
[1460.36 → 1467.88] my ap and there was that funny thing where um some of my clients didn't support forcing 2.4 gigahertz
[1467.88 → 1473.24] and while every other access point that I was originally going to include in my test one from ubiquity
[1473.24 → 1480.52] um a couple from links anyway every other one supported splitting out the ss splitting out 2.4
[1480.52 → 1485.48] gigahertz and 5 gigahertz into separate SSIDs so I could manually connect to them separately
[1485.48 → 1492.44] the Merck doesn't even support forcing 2.4 gigahertz on a SSID until Luke called them
[1492.44 → 1497.24] honestly the dude on the phone was like super nice yeah, and they were really fast they returned the call
[1497.24 → 1501.88] really fast yeah they picked up really quickly they solved the problem really quickly, and they're
[1501.88 → 1510.12] really nice no not once I don't think so real dude and like fixed it right away, but he had to add
[1510.12 → 1515.88] a button to Luke's cloud management interface to force 2.4 gigahertz why is this button not in here
[1515.88 → 1521.32] already yeah it's cool they're able to add it yeah but I shouldn't have to call support for a basic
[1521.32 → 1526.76] feature like that I think part of the reason is that uh that ap that you have isn't like isn't
[1526.76 → 1532.12] actually their highest end ap so it's kind of like bridging between enterprise and consumer so i
[1532.12 → 1536.04] think they're trying to help people like more like I wouldn't say consumer but like small business yeah
[1536.04 → 1540.44] yeah, yeah so I think they're trying to help people not screw up considering that option exists I'm sure
[1540.44 → 1544.52] on the even higher version it's probably there because they're expecting more of an IP administration
[1545.32 → 1551.24] yeah so I don't know if they should lose too many points for that but well a more fair comparison
[1551.32 → 1556.28] and where I might be better prepared to uh to do more of this testing like now that I know what
[1556.28 → 1563.08] I'm doing i I burned like probably 16 hours of the time I spent prepping that video figuring out a way
[1563.08 → 1568.60] to get repeatable results so once I have a bet I have better gear once I have better software once I've
[1568.60 → 1574.20] had some more time to tinker with it, I might tackle this again and then that would probably be a good time
[1574.20 → 1580.60] for when um because we talked to ruckus about their x claim product line yeah so not the r series product
[1580.60 → 1587.88] line, but that would be probably more comparable to your Karachi anyway um where these are
[1587.88 → 1597.08] managed these are app managed uh wow that is that's a new fan art from jack sack did more fan
[1597.08 → 1604.52] art hold on we have to show this that's so good that was so fast how does he do it so fast dude it's
[1604.52 → 1610.36] awesome I love his art style a wizard I love how you just magically have super long hair
[1612.04 → 1615.64] well I think it was supposed to be like a modification of the pc master race guy
[1616.44 → 1621.64] I don't think so no I think it's just like the beauty hair thing yeah I think it's just majestic yeah
[1621.64 → 1631.56] that's awesome oh this is legitimately pretty cool I know I was like kind of playing around with it
[1632.44 → 1637.00] like he's like it's not bad he's very potable yeah fully pose, and he actually manages to hold the gun
[1637.72 → 1642.60] which is a better than most action figures I got as a kid I don't think this is like these don't get
[1642.60 → 1646.92] archived or anything right no yeah okay, so this isn't getting archived we're not this isn't a sponsor
[1646.92 → 1650.84] spot anymore that was honestly I was not really sold on the creek before and that was actually
[1650.84 → 1657.08] pretty cool you get a lot of stuff for 14 bucks a shirt is about what you normally get yeah it's a
[1657.08 → 1660.84] pretty cool shirt unless you're Luke in which case every one of your shirts is free all my shirts are free
[1662.52 → 1668.36] and like I'm not super into the little action figure thing, but the bandana was cool yeah um the coin if
[1668.36 → 1675.64] that game was good was cool yeah um the uh sorry I already said the bandana the free game that's I like
[1675.64 → 1680.68] that they have like a variety of stuff yes so they hit like it's kind of like and like there's
[1680.68 → 1686.04] enough value there's enough value in each type of variety that it was probably worth it even if
[1686.04 → 1689.80] there's a bunch of stuff you don't care I don't know how they do it so cheaply just to be
[1689.80 → 1695.48] perfectly honest mass yeah mass ordering yeah even, even then like things like t-shirts only go down to
[1695.48 → 1700.52] a certain cost like well there's like six dollar t-shirts.com and stuff yeah, but that's you just have to
[1700.52 → 1705.48] produce enough so that's six dollars so like yeah they only have thirteen dollars but no they sell
[1705.48 → 1710.28] it for six dollars I know, but it's cheaper so maybe it's four dollars or three dollars, but that's
[1710.28 → 1715.72] still using up a significant chunk of your budget yeah, and it's probably like they do this every month
[1716.04 → 1723.16] you can move his forms um they do this every month so they probably just have like some super
[1723.16 → 1727.00] crazy contract where it's like yeah we're ordering like 10 000 shirts a month from you so we get blah blah
[1727.00 → 1731.24] a lot yeah possibly a lot more than 10 000. I mean I have no idea how much business they do
[1731.24 → 1737.96] either I'm pretty sure it's huge though it's significant yeah yeah because I'm sure I'm not
[1737.96 → 1744.60] the first person who's been like oh it could be a good idea if I order this myself and then sift through
[1744.60 → 1748.68] the stuff and give it to someone else's presence like I'm sure I'm not the first person that's done
[1748.68 → 1753.08] that there's got to be some mom that subscribed to it and then uses everything in there as stocking
[1753.08 → 1757.48] stuffers for Christmas for example yeah people even like get this stuff to like to decorate their
[1757.48 → 1763.48] offices like when we went to the hyper x office yeah that one person had like so many pop vinyls
[1763.48 → 1768.12] yeah on their thing not sure if they got it through loot crate or through funk but like yeah right
[1768.12 → 1774.04] and actually this wouldn't be a bad thing for uh for us to have as just set dressing for sets and
[1774.04 → 1779.64] stuff because we did order some junk from think geek that you know it's amazing how people some people
[1779.64 → 1784.84] were upset about that they're like yeah i you know contributed to first blood and you guys
[1784.84 → 1789.80] went and spent money on there were some pieces yeahs it's like we need some of that stuff around
[1789.80 → 1795.40] here because we can't just have a blank wall like that poster we own like yeah it's not like it's just
[1795.40 → 1800.28] like they're here for us to like occasionally we'll have it in the background of something or whatever
[1800.28 → 1805.24] else when we need something yeah, or we'll like hit Linus with it like we throw them at me all the stuff
[1805.24 → 1814.28] behind this the horse head we didn't pay for my head's been in there for like hours at this point
[1817.40 → 1824.28] I'm just like you can go for it but like that's two Halloween's now that's the entire piece you build
[1824.28 → 1830.36] that packs based on how much your hands sweat actually my head's not the same his hands sweat
[1830.36 → 1837.80] way more than anything you go to the gym like you don't really sweat no much yeah I sweat like
[1837.80 → 1843.00] my hands like I think all the sweat in my entire body just like comes to my hands then it's just like
[1843.00 → 1847.00] draw understand how your hands do that no because you're right I don't really when I work out and
[1847.00 → 1852.44] stuff like I'm way sweatier in general than you and my hands are not as bad as yours yeah I don't know
[1853.00 → 1858.12] someone's asking us to check out arrow hive access points I mean we're I'm not even sure if this is a
[1858.12 → 1866.20] category we're going to continue to be interested in but uh no I don't think we should, I don't think i
[1866.20 → 1871.08] don't think we should either we're not doing AI o liquid coolers any more right I don't think so
[1872.52 → 1879.40] how big is the radiator cool that's how well it performs it's like yeah I don't know
[1881.56 → 1887.08] at least with air coolers there are a lot of more unique shapes and yeah weird things that they'll do it's
[1887.08 → 1891.40] like this is good for this system even if the performance is identical to everything else yeah
[1891.40 → 1896.52] yeah yeah yeah it's like if you need to ram on either side of your CPU socket this might be important
[1896.52 → 1901.56] yeah stuff like that and like the only things that I could see as an advantage of like those
[1902.20 → 1908.60] Genentech or whatever ones that are coming out is like they look cooler yeah and good good-looking air
[1908.60 → 1914.28] coolers I'm I'm totally into yeah but like to do an AI liquid cooler review and be like the only thing
[1914.28 → 1919.24] that's different is that it looks cool it's just like this is like awesome stuff this guy's like
[1919.24 → 1924.60] yeah I got all this stuff from loot crate oh I guess I could just screen share deep in uh in a year
[1924.60 → 1931.88] he got that oh my goodness oh wow he got a little Viking from Skyrim I like I just said like I like
[1931.88 → 1938.28] the adventure time the adventure time you got a blue mega man helmet man I'm jelly the adventure time stuff
[1938.28 → 1943.64] is fantastic that's really cool I think the big man helmets were randomized yeah they were uh there's
[1943.64 → 1948.44] a lot of stuff in their like I got one of their like hey we're getting rid of all the stuff we have
[1948.44 → 1953.32] lying around crates one time and I got like the jazz transformer guy there was like a bunch of them
[1953.88 → 1966.28] I think it's jazz that's one of them I don't know there's a jazz so not e-jazz a jazz yeah
[1966.28 → 1967.64] yeah
[1971.80 → 1978.76] all right I think uh Burke needs you to look at something so oh okay peace guys bye everyone
[1978.76 → 1983.32] we might go get food I'm going to stream later okay bye I think that's all I really need to say you can click
[1983.32 → 1984.44] the button
