[0.00 --> 4.76]  What is up ladies and gentlepersons? It's time for the WAN Show again!
[4.76 --> 7.00]  That's right, I am a short king!
[7.00 --> 8.20]  Yeah, I still don't get it.
[8.20 --> 10.00]  As crowned by Smosh!
[10.00 --> 11.00]  What?
[11.00 --> 15.50]  I know. I actually am hearing about this for the first time now as well.
[15.50 --> 16.00]  Okay.
[16.00 --> 17.50]  Here in the WAN Show document.
[17.50 --> 18.00]  Alright.
[18.00 --> 20.50]  But I figured, hey, it's a good title for the video.
[20.50 --> 21.00]  Sure.
[21.00 --> 25.50]  So, let's lean into it and hopefully a short king is not something really insulting.
[25.50 --> 26.50]  I don't think it is.
[26.50 --> 36.50]  In other news this week, Microsoft and Google have laid off thousands of workers again, which is kind of terrifying.
[36.50 --> 39.50]  It's like 5% of Microsoft's workforce or something.
[39.50 --> 41.50]  Big deal, big deal.
[41.50 --> 50.50]  AI art generators face first two major copyright lawsuits and from a party that you might not be too surprised to be involved.
[50.50 --> 58.50]  Also, US farmers win right to repair farm equipment while Samsung undermines independent screen repair at the same time.
[58.50 --> 61.50]  Oh, and there's one more thing before I roll the intro.
[61.50 --> 68.50]  We have actually got a not just producer like Dan the producer, ba ba ba ba, there he is, for the WAN Show.
[68.50 --> 72.50]  But we've got someone whose entire full-time job is to make the WAN Show better.
[72.50 --> 74.50]  And this may be, yeah I know right?
[74.50 --> 76.50]  I was gonna say this may be the first you're hearing of it.
[76.50 --> 77.50]  Well, yeah.
[77.50 --> 81.50]  But she just started and so she's still on her probation.
[81.50 --> 85.50]  So, I guess I should not have disclosed anything about this individual.
[85.50 --> 88.50]  Cause, you never know how things will go.
[88.50 --> 94.50]  But at any rate, it means we are going to have things like fun new segments.
[94.50 --> 97.50]  Meet the Wheel of Pain.
[97.50 --> 100.50]  Okay, so, yeah I can't read it.
[100.50 --> 102.50]  Don't worry too much about it for now.
[102.50 --> 103.50]  We will deal with the Wheel of Pain later.
[103.50 --> 104.50]  For now!
[104.50 --> 108.50]  So, at this point in time, I literally know less about that than any of you do.
[108.50 --> 110.50]  Because I couldn't read that.
[110.50 --> 112.50]  I have no idea what it is.
[112.50 --> 114.50]  I've been told I'm not allowed to read a certain part of the doc.
[114.50 --> 117.50]  All I know is there's a wheel and it's of pain.
[117.50 --> 118.50]  It's of pain.
[118.50 --> 119.50]  Yeah.
[119.50 --> 120.50]  No, no.
[120.50 --> 121.50]  Okay, try again.
[121.50 --> 122.50]  The Wheel of Pain.
[122.50 --> 123.50]  No, no, no.
[123.50 --> 124.50]  The Wheel of Pain.
[124.50 --> 125.50]  Much better.
[125.50 --> 126.50]  Got it.
[126.50 --> 127.50]  Oh, wow.
[127.50 --> 128.50]  That was weird.
[128.50 --> 154.50]  The show is brought to you today by Vessi, Audible, and one that kind of glitched out a little bit there.
[154.50 --> 155.50]  Forum.
[155.50 --> 156.50]  Forum!
[156.50 --> 157.50]  Oh, yeah.
[157.50 --> 159.50]  That's going to be an interesting one to talk about and show you.
[159.50 --> 162.50]  Why don't we jump right into our first topic of the week.
[162.50 --> 167.50]  I know this is not exactly a tech topic, but it piqued my curiosity.
[167.50 --> 168.50]  Smosh!
[168.50 --> 169.50]  The once popular...
[169.50 --> 171.50]  Oh, that's editorializing a little bit.
[171.50 --> 173.50]  Oh, that's not what it said.
[173.50 --> 178.50]  Once the most popular channel on YouTube made a video called...
[178.50 --> 179.50]  They're doing really well.
[179.50 --> 184.50]  Short Kings rank Short Kings on their sister channel, Smosh Pit.
[184.50 --> 190.50]  Spencer, one of the rankers, called Linus the gold standard for tech YouTubers.
[190.50 --> 191.50]  Oh.
[191.50 --> 192.50]  Okay, so here.
[192.50 --> 193.50]  Hold on a second.
[193.50 --> 194.50]  I'm going to bring this up.
[194.50 --> 196.50]  Am I able to screen share with the stream?
[196.50 --> 198.50]  Is that a thing that works now?
[198.50 --> 200.50]  Okay, let's go.
[200.50 --> 201.50]  Here we go.
[201.50 --> 202.50]  I think it's clean.
[202.50 --> 203.50]  Agnew, right?
[203.50 --> 204.50]  I think.
[204.50 --> 205.50]  I believe.
[205.50 --> 206.50]  Okay, here we go.
[206.50 --> 209.50]  I was in a kick there for a long time where I was watching a bunch of Smosh content.
[209.50 --> 210.50]  Here we go.
[210.50 --> 211.50]  Hey, Linus Tech Tips.
[211.50 --> 212.50]  Yeah.
[212.50 --> 213.50]  Hey, here we go.
[213.50 --> 214.50]  Five, six.
[214.50 --> 215.50]  Yes, that is true.
[215.50 --> 216.50]  Is it?
[216.50 --> 218.50]  Uh, yes.
[218.50 --> 219.50]  Yes, that is true.
[219.50 --> 220.50]  Come on.
[220.50 --> 221.50]  I'm not going to lie about it.
[221.50 --> 223.50]  Do you get S tiered?
[223.50 --> 224.50]  Does he give you an S tier?
[224.50 --> 225.50]  I think he's great.
[225.50 --> 226.50]  He's funny.
[226.50 --> 227.50]  Aw, that's not...
[227.50 --> 228.50]  He's niche.
[228.50 --> 229.50]  He's niche.
[229.50 --> 230.50]  No, that's true.
[230.50 --> 231.50]  That's fair.
[231.50 --> 232.50]  Okay.
[232.50 --> 234.50]  They'd be like, what the...
[234.50 --> 235.50]  Stop.
[235.50 --> 236.50]  Let's put him in.
[236.50 --> 237.50]  Let's put him in.
[237.50 --> 238.50]  Let's throw him a bee.
[238.50 --> 240.50]  I don't know if bee makes you a king.
[240.50 --> 241.50]  Well, hold on a second.
[241.50 --> 242.50]  Hold on a second.
[242.50 --> 243.50]  Wait a second.
[243.50 --> 244.50]  Wait a second.
[244.50 --> 246.50]  Was that Tom Holland next to me on bee shelf though?
[246.50 --> 247.50]  Oh, wow.
[247.50 --> 248.50]  Okay.
[248.50 --> 249.50]  Because I don't even feel bad at that point.
[249.50 --> 250.50]  Hold on.
[250.50 --> 252.50]  Who else we looking at here?
[252.50 --> 253.50]  Hold on.
[253.50 --> 254.50]  That's Markiplier.
[254.50 --> 255.50]  Whoa!
[255.50 --> 256.50]  That's Tom Holland.
[256.50 --> 257.50]  Alright.
[257.50 --> 258.50]  Alright.
[258.50 --> 259.50]  You're doing pretty good.
[259.50 --> 260.50]  Alright.
[260.50 --> 261.50]  That's a strong bee.
[261.50 --> 262.50]  That's a strong bee.
[262.50 --> 263.50]  That's a strong bee.
[263.50 --> 266.50]  What the hell makes you an A on this list?
[266.50 --> 269.50]  It's gotta be pretty intense, I think.
[269.50 --> 271.50]  What's an A?
[271.50 --> 273.50]  Who's an A to your king?
[273.50 --> 274.50]  Hold on a second here.
[274.50 --> 275.50]  Okay.
[275.50 --> 277.50]  Let's just wait till they zoom in on the thing.
[277.50 --> 278.50]  Or jump to the end.
[278.50 --> 279.50]  Yeah, yeah.
[279.50 --> 280.50]  I just wanna see the board.
[280.50 --> 281.50]  Show me the board.
[281.50 --> 282.50]  I wanna see the board.
[282.50 --> 283.50]  Where's the board at?
[283.50 --> 284.50]  Where's the board at?
[284.50 --> 285.50]  Oh my god.
[285.50 --> 288.50]  It is hard to find, cause it's quite short.
[288.50 --> 290.50]  You piece of shit.
[290.50 --> 297.50]  You know, you're not allowed to make those jokes.
[297.50 --> 299.50]  You know that's how that works, right?
[299.50 --> 300.50]  Yeah.
[300.50 --> 302.50]  Got em.
[302.50 --> 305.50]  Oh, see that's real insecure.
[305.50 --> 308.50]  Spencer here, with the half inch.
[308.50 --> 309.50]  Okay.
[309.50 --> 313.50]  For my metric friends out there, a half inch is not a lot.
[313.50 --> 315.50]  It's not worth it.
[315.50 --> 316.50]  It's not worth it.
[316.50 --> 318.50]  It makes you seem insecure.
[318.50 --> 321.50]  If you have to put the half inch in, you...
[321.50 --> 325.50]  I wouldn't recommend it.
[326.50 --> 327.50]  Okay.
[328.50 --> 329.50]  Can they...
[329.50 --> 330.50]  Can they show...
[330.50 --> 331.50]  I wanna zoom into the board.
[331.50 --> 332.50]  The board.
[332.50 --> 333.50]  Oh my god.
[333.50 --> 335.50]  So there's a tier above A though.
[335.50 --> 336.50]  There's S tier.
[336.50 --> 338.50]  They don't zoom into the board.
[339.50 --> 341.50]  I can zoom myself.
[341.50 --> 342.50]  Danny DeVito.
[342.50 --> 343.50]  Danny DeVito.
[343.50 --> 344.50]  Wait.
[344.50 --> 345.50]  F***ing little?
[346.50 --> 347.50]  That's a fictional character.
[347.50 --> 351.50]  Okay, I don't recognize any of these other people.
[351.50 --> 352.50]  It's a little blurry.
[352.50 --> 354.50]  Okay, who's my A tier?
[354.50 --> 358.50]  Some soccer player mega mans in there.
[358.50 --> 359.50]  Okay.
[359.50 --> 360.50]  What is this?
[360.50 --> 362.50]  Jesus with a trimmed beard?
[362.50 --> 364.50]  Okay, I don't know who any of these people are.
[364.50 --> 365.50]  You know what?
[365.50 --> 366.50]  I am...
[366.50 --> 367.50]  I'm pretty happy.
[367.50 --> 369.50]  I got Elmer Fudd up in here.
[369.50 --> 370.50]  B tier looks strong.
[370.50 --> 371.50]  Yeah, B tier.
[371.50 --> 372.50]  B tier legitimately looks strong.
[372.50 --> 374.50]  B tier seems like...
[374.50 --> 376.50]  Honestly, I feel like the A and the S tier,
[376.50 --> 379.50]  they were mostly just memeing except Danny DeVito, who is amazing.
[379.50 --> 380.50]  Yes.
[380.50 --> 383.50]  And B tier is like kind of where the solid short kings go.
[383.50 --> 385.50]  Apparently Jack Black was in S tier.
[385.50 --> 386.50]  Oh, Jack Black was in S tier.
[386.50 --> 387.50]  I mean, alright.
[387.50 --> 388.50]  Messi is up there.
[388.50 --> 389.50]  I don't...
[389.50 --> 393.50]  Someone said lost to Messi, but they didn't say if it was A or S.
[393.50 --> 394.50]  But either way.
[394.50 --> 395.50]  Alright.
[395.50 --> 396.50]  Yeah, that's fine.
[396.50 --> 397.50]  I'm happy with it.
[397.50 --> 398.50]  Lord Farquaad...
[398.50 --> 399.50]  Apparently you beat Tom Cruise.
[399.50 --> 400.50]  I beat Tom Cruise.
[400.50 --> 401.50]  That's pretty good.
[401.50 --> 402.50]  I mean...
[402.50 --> 403.50]  That's pretty good.
[403.50 --> 404.50]  Sort of.
[404.50 --> 406.50]  It really depends on how you're ranking Tom Cruise.
[406.50 --> 407.50]  That's true.
[407.50 --> 413.50]  If you rank Tom Cruise as a successful movie producer, then he probably belongs in S tier.
[413.50 --> 414.50]  Yes.
[414.50 --> 415.50]  If you rank Tom Cruise as...
[415.50 --> 416.50]  As a runner?
[416.50 --> 417.50]  Also S tier.
[417.50 --> 418.50]  As a runner.
[418.50 --> 419.50]  Yeah.
[419.50 --> 421.50]  I mean, I've seen him run on a broken ankle.
[421.50 --> 422.50]  For real though.
[422.50 --> 426.50]  Like he like broke his ankle doing a stunt and then just kept running, which is like...
[426.50 --> 429.50]  He's actually extremely good at running like genuinely.
[429.50 --> 430.50]  Yeah.
[430.50 --> 436.50]  But if you rank Tom Cruise as an individual with both hinges attached to the wall...
[436.50 --> 444.50]  Sometimes, when you're extremely excessively good at something, other things kind of fall off a little bit.
[444.50 --> 447.50]  I mean, that's one way of talking about it.
[447.50 --> 452.50]  Either way, I'm happy with my B tier ranking and we can move on now.
[452.50 --> 455.50]  Maybe he'll get on the spaceship.
[455.50 --> 461.50]  In worst news, Microsoft and Google have laid off thousands of workers.
[461.50 --> 462.50]  And this is not...
[462.50 --> 463.50]  No.
[463.50 --> 464.50]  This is not deja vu.
[464.50 --> 467.50]  You are not watching an old WAN show from a few weeks ago.
[467.50 --> 469.50]  This is like...
[469.50 --> 470.50]  This is like again.
[470.50 --> 471.50]  This is still happening.
[471.50 --> 476.50]  The tech sector is shedding workers like there is absolutely no tomorrow.
[476.50 --> 480.50]  Microsoft announced it is cutting 10,000 jobs.
[480.50 --> 482.50]  That's nearly 5% of its workers.
[482.50 --> 490.50]  The stated reasons include changes in consumer preferences and macroeconomic conditions.
[490.50 --> 495.50]  While Microsoft is cutting jobs in some areas though, they are actually still hiring in others,
[495.50 --> 497.50]  notably in the AI department.
[497.50 --> 505.50]  I mean, we've talked about this a fair bit over the last couple of months, but GPT-3, the upcoming GPT-4,
[505.50 --> 515.50]  Microsoft's major investment in open AI seems to indicate that they are laser focused on what chatbots mean for their future business.
[515.50 --> 523.50]  Whether it's Azure, whether it's Bing, whether it's Windows, I think we're going to see extremely deep integration.
[523.50 --> 530.50]  A lot of the stuff that Microsoft has openly shown that they care about on the consumer side of things for the last very long time,
[530.50 --> 540.50]  Cortana, Bing, other things like that, would be aided very heavily by the popular thing in AI right now, which is large language models.
[540.50 --> 545.50]  So improved versions of that would be extremely valuable to Microsoft, so it makes sense.
[545.50 --> 555.50]  Interestingly, Microsoft announced the layoffs on January 18th, one year to the day after they announced their plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $69 billion,
[555.50 --> 562.50]  and one week after reports indicated the company plans to invest $10 billion in open AI.
[562.50 --> 564.50]  So they have money.
[564.50 --> 565.50]  Interesting.
[565.50 --> 570.50]  They have just chosen not to spend it on retaining workers.
[570.50 --> 573.50]  So I don't have notes for this, so I'm going to say things that are wrong.
[573.50 --> 575.50]  I'm just prefacing it like that.
[575.50 --> 576.50]  Nice.
[576.50 --> 577.50]  We liked you better last week.
[577.50 --> 579.50]  When I just couldn't talk.
[579.50 --> 581.50]  At least you didn't say anything inaccurate.
[581.50 --> 589.50]  As far as I know, once open AI makes enough money that they can pay back whatever.
[589.50 --> 591.50]  Like Microsoft's investment, you mean?
[591.50 --> 598.50]  Yeah, the like shares are gone and everything kind of reverts back to being owned and operated under open AI.
[598.50 --> 604.50]  So I wonder if this $10 billion investment is to try to stave that off.
[604.50 --> 609.50]  Oh, I actually, I have no way of knowing the terms of...
[609.50 --> 610.50]  I have no clue.
[610.50 --> 620.50]  I don't remember what the terms were, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but I feel like this might be kind of like a defensive maneuver because they see them potentially doing too well too fast, so they need to up their investment potentially.
[620.50 --> 624.50]  I don't know. Maybe. I know nothing. Moving on.
[624.50 --> 630.50]  Meanwhile, Google is cutting 12,000 employees or around 6% of its workforce.
[630.50 --> 639.50]  Google's CEO stated that following two years of dramatic growth, Google hired for a different economic reality than the one they are currently facing.
[639.50 --> 645.50]  Over the course of the pandemic, Google's workforce increased by 78,000 jobs.
[645.50 --> 647.50]  I mean...
[647.50 --> 649.50]  That's so much.
[649.50 --> 651.50]  I don't know, man.
[651.50 --> 658.50]  See, this is the thing that's so frustrating to me is when management gets it right, management benefits.
[658.50 --> 663.50]  And when management gets it wrong...
[663.50 --> 666.50]  At most companies, the employees get hit.
[666.50 --> 667.50]  Yeah.
[667.50 --> 671.50]  So, I mean, we've talked a lot about sustainable hiring.
[671.50 --> 693.50]  I think I've talked about this on WAN Show before, but basically the way that Yvonne and I forecast when we sit down and we set a budget for hiring is we look at the previous year and basically go, okay, assuming no growth whatsoever next year based on that year.
[693.50 --> 700.50]  We basically build in that we could revert back to last year's performance and not grow at all.
[700.50 --> 705.50]  Can we afford whatever it is that we're hiring for this year?
[705.50 --> 706.50]  Is...
[706.50 --> 707.50]  Was that clear?
[707.50 --> 714.50]  So, our hiring budget for this year is affected by how we performed last year and assuming that the following year will be like that.
[714.50 --> 723.50]  What has actually happened is for eight out of our ten years, we have experienced significant growth.
[723.50 --> 728.50]  For two out of our ten years, we've had what we've kind of called reinvestment years.
[728.50 --> 743.50]  And that's a big part of the reason that we take that approach is because it gives us the flexibility to have a reinvestment year where we can make long-term investments that might not pay off for two years or three years.
[743.50 --> 749.50]  I'm expecting this year that we're in right now to be what we would call a reinvestment year.
[749.50 --> 750.50]  I'm not expecting...
[750.50 --> 754.50]  Well, actually, we're forecasting less profit this year than last year.
[754.50 --> 764.50]  For any Linus Media Group, Floatplane, or Creator Warehouse employees who are watching, that's okay.
[764.50 --> 765.50]  Yeah.
[765.50 --> 766.50]  Yeah.
[766.50 --> 767.50]  Yeah.
[767.50 --> 768.50]  It will pay off in 2024.
[768.50 --> 769.50]  It'll be fine.
[769.50 --> 770.50]  Everything's good.
[770.50 --> 775.50]  And if it didn't, we'd still be able to afford it because it's all kind of based on how last year went.
[775.50 --> 778.50]  Anywho, I don't know.
[778.50 --> 782.50]  It's frustrating to me because this feels like such a management failure.
[782.50 --> 788.50]  And yet, I pretty much promise that Google's stock went up this week.
[788.50 --> 790.50]  Like, here, I don't actually know.
[790.50 --> 791.50]  I don't actually know.
[791.50 --> 793.50]  Oftentimes, the response stock does go up in these situations.
[793.50 --> 795.50]  Do I have Google on my thing?
[795.50 --> 796.50]  Oh, no.
[796.50 --> 797.50]  Oh, wait.
[797.50 --> 798.50]  Yes.
[798.50 --> 801.50]  Google's stock is up like 5% today.
[801.50 --> 802.50]  Genius.
[802.50 --> 807.50]  Investors like it when a bunch of people get fired.
[807.50 --> 810.50]  Yeah, which I...
[810.50 --> 811.50]  I don't know.
[811.50 --> 814.50]  Here's an alternate way of looking at it.
[814.50 --> 822.50]  Should investors like it when management is so incompetent that they accidentally hire 12,000 too many people?
[822.50 --> 832.50]  That they then can't afford to pay and presumably whose projects, whatever it is that they're working on, are now stalled?
[832.50 --> 834.50]  Like, I just...
[834.50 --> 836.50]  I don't understand this way of thinking.
[836.50 --> 837.50]  It's frustrating.
[837.50 --> 838.50]  Yeah.
[838.50 --> 845.50]  Ben Mitchell in Floatplane Chat says, Google stock went up 5% when they fired 5% of their employees.
[845.50 --> 849.50]  Maybe, if they want the stock to go up 100%.
[849.50 --> 850.50]  Just fire everybody.
[850.50 --> 852.50]  Including Cook.
[852.50 --> 856.50]  Okay, I'm gonna buy some Google real quick.
[856.50 --> 857.50]  On that...
[857.50 --> 858.50]  Excuse me.
[858.50 --> 864.50]  On that subject, I actually have some more details to share on my next investment that is now final.
[864.50 --> 866.50]  The wire has gone through.
[866.50 --> 869.50]  They have effectively deposited the funds.
[869.50 --> 870.50]  They've cashed the check.
[870.50 --> 875.50]  I'll tell you guys a little bit more about it, but first, let's talk through the rest of this Google stuff.
[875.50 --> 882.50]  So, affected employees from Google will receive 60 days of pay, followed by at least 16 weeks of severance.
[882.50 --> 883.50]  Like, if I had...
[883.50 --> 885.50]  I mean, you gotta at least give them credit there.
[885.50 --> 887.50]  That is a pretty decent severance package.
[887.50 --> 888.50]  Like, if I had...
[888.50 --> 890.50]  16 weeks of severance is like...
[891.50 --> 894.50]  Yeah, if I had 6 months to kind of figure out what I'm gonna do next...
[895.50 --> 901.50]  A affected police will receive 60 days pay, followed by at least 16 weeks severance.
[901.50 --> 902.50]  What's the difference here?
[902.50 --> 903.50]  I'm not sure.
[903.50 --> 905.50]  I'm sure there's some distinction, like, legally.
[905.50 --> 910.50]  Um, but, like Microsoft, Google's AI department is unaffected.
[910.50 --> 916.50]  And the speculation here is likely because of the threat that ChatGPT poses to Google's dominance.
[916.50 --> 922.50]  Honestly, asking ChatGPT things is so much better than Googling them.
[922.50 --> 923.50]  You do have to...
[924.50 --> 925.50]  I know you know this.
[925.50 --> 926.50]  I know.
[926.50 --> 927.50]  It's an old dataset.
[927.50 --> 928.50]  Old dataset.
[928.50 --> 931.50]  It's an old dataset, and you have to remember that it will confidently be wrong.
[931.50 --> 934.50]  Um, so you have to keep your mind about you.
[934.50 --> 935.50]  But it is...
[935.50 --> 936.50]  Oh, yeah.
[936.50 --> 939.50]  Google search results can be confidently wrong, too.
[939.50 --> 940.50]  Absolutely.
[940.50 --> 941.50]  That's the thing.
[941.50 --> 942.50]  Yeah.
[942.50 --> 943.50]  Here's the challenge, though.
[943.50 --> 944.50]  I read a really interesting article a while back.
[944.50 --> 945.50]  I really...
[945.50 --> 946.50]  Hmm.
[946.50 --> 950.50]  I wish I had it in front of me so I could give you guys a more accurate summary of it.
[950.50 --> 955.50]  But essentially, it made the argument that voice assistants, as we know them, are doomed.
[955.50 --> 957.50]  They're going away.
[957.50 --> 963.50]  The model was supposed to be that by collecting all of this information, building these natural language models,
[963.50 --> 975.50]  and making these voice assistants ubiquitous in our lives, either in the phones in our pockets or in the smart speakers in our kitchens or wherever else they happen to be found, in our TVs.
[975.50 --> 984.50]  Uh, they would somehow start to sell us things, and therefore generate a value to advertisers, generating a value to the companies who have built them.
[984.50 --> 989.50]  As far as anyone can tell, Cortana's gone.
[989.50 --> 993.50]  Alexa seems to be losing copious amounts of money.
[993.50 --> 997.50]  The whole experiment has fundamentally failed.
[997.50 --> 998.50]  Alexa seems to be losing copious amounts of money.
[998.50 --> 1003.50]  And what I wonder is, was the problem that they weren't good enough?
[1003.50 --> 1004.50]  Yes.
[1004.50 --> 1006.50]  That was part of it.
[1006.50 --> 1007.50]  At least part of it, yeah.
[1007.50 --> 1010.50]  They are fairly crap.
[1010.50 --> 1020.50]  Or, was the problem that people will simply not interact with someone who is constantly trying to sell them something?
[1020.50 --> 1033.50]  So, what I'm trying to say is, is ChatGPT going to only be a viable alternative to Google searching until it starts trying to sell us crap?
[1033.50 --> 1035.50]  Unless it's a paid service.
[1035.50 --> 1042.50]  And if it can't successfully sell us crap, then will it ultimately just not find a way of being commercialized?
[1042.50 --> 1052.50]  Because, like, if you think about it, I don't mind looking up information by myself and being bombarded with ads.
[1052.50 --> 1054.50]  It's just kind of part of the process.
[1054.50 --> 1060.50]  Whether I am seeking out information in a newspaper or TV or on a webpage.
[1060.50 --> 1067.50]  But, and maybe I'm outing myself as a bit of an introvert here.
[1067.50 --> 1077.50]  If I have to communicate with someone and be sold something, I would rather just buy nothing and walk away.
[1077.50 --> 1084.50]  Like, there's certain types of purchase experiences that I just, like, I dread them.
[1084.50 --> 1098.50]  Like, I was thinking, hey, I have not adorned my wife with any precious metals or jewels in a solid seven to eight years.
[1098.50 --> 1100.50]  Maybe we're due.
[1100.50 --> 1103.50]  I should probably take her jewelry shopping.
[1103.50 --> 1107.50]  And I just, man, you ever gone, like, jewelry shopping?
[1107.50 --> 1108.50]  The mall?
[1108.50 --> 1111.50]  They're like, they're like hyenas.
[1111.50 --> 1112.50]  I hate it.
[1112.50 --> 1113.50]  They're so aggressive.
[1113.50 --> 1114.50]  Yeah.
[1114.50 --> 1117.50]  You tell them, no, I'm just browsing for now.
[1117.50 --> 1121.50]  Like, I will even, my body language is completely closed.
[1121.50 --> 1130.50]  I will preemptively, before they even get a chance to inhale, to open their mouths and start talking to me, I'll say, I'm just browsing for now, thank you.
[1130.50 --> 1132.50]  And they hover.
[1132.50 --> 1133.50]  They hover.
[1133.50 --> 1136.50]  They're practically breathing down your neck.
[1136.50 --> 1142.50]  And it drives me crazy because, and maybe I'm about to prove myself wrong, right?
[1142.50 --> 1146.50]  It drives me crazy because they wouldn't do it if it didn't work on somebody.
[1146.50 --> 1147.50]  Oh, yeah.
[1147.50 --> 1169.50]  But if, if, if, if the more natural you make the interaction for me with this chat bot or with this voice assistant or whatever it is, I feel like the more personally offended or bothered or attacked or whatever the word is, the more personally anxious I'm going to be when they try to sell me something ultimately.
[1169.50 --> 1172.50]  Does that, does that make sense or am I way off base here?
[1172.50 --> 1174.50]  No, that makes sense.
[1174.50 --> 1184.50]  I just, I think, and I'm, I'm probably going to be wrong and they're probably going to go with a different model and that will be super bad.
[1184.50 --> 1194.50]  Um, but I'm really hoping they go for a prosumer type of approach and charge for it.
[1194.50 --> 1195.50]  Not if it's Microsoft.
[1195.50 --> 1199.50]  I mean, Microsoft doesn't even charge for windows anymore, essentially.
[1199.50 --> 1200.50]  Yeah.
[1200.50 --> 1203.50]  Like what even, what even is Microsoft's business?
[1203.50 --> 1205.50]  It's pretty clear they're, they're chasing that.
[1205.50 --> 1210.50]  I mean, why else would they have kept beating this dead Bing horse?
[1210.50 --> 1211.50]  Yeah.
[1211.50 --> 1214.50]  It's, it's gotta be an advertising model.
[1214.50 --> 1219.50]  I mean, obviously they're, they're certainly open to, to software as a service.
[1219.50 --> 1230.50]  I mean, we, we see that with Game Pass, but like, again, back to what the best way to monetize something that interacts with you.
[1230.50 --> 1239.50]  They had a free version, like if there was like a YouTube premium chat GPT or a YouTube premium Bing powered by chat GPT, whatever, I would pay for that.
[1239.50 --> 1240.50]  Like Bing premium.
[1240.50 --> 1241.50]  Yeah.
[1241.50 --> 1247.50]  It won't be though, because they would, they, they, you don't want your brand to be sullied by the crappy version.
[1247.50 --> 1252.50]  I mean, Microsoft learned this back in the day with windows 2000 and windows ME.
[1252.50 --> 1259.50]  I mean, what they look at the, why are we maintaining a good kernel kernel?
[1259.50 --> 1261.50]  Why don't we just have one good kernel?
[1261.50 --> 1262.50]  One good one.
[1262.50 --> 1263.50]  Yeah.
[1263.50 --> 1273.50]  There was a thread on Twitter where people were talking about like what they would pay for chat GPT powered by GPT 4.0, whatever.
[1273.50 --> 1274.50]  Sure.
[1274.50 --> 1281.50]  Um, and that you and I both know that that type of interaction is always useless trash.
[1281.50 --> 1284.50]  Cause all the people talking are like, Oh, I'll pay whatever.
[1284.50 --> 1287.50]  And then it comes time to do it and they don't.
[1287.50 --> 1294.50]  Pulling your actual credit card out of your actual wallet is much higher friction than talking about how you're going to like spend money on the internet.
[1294.50 --> 1295.50]  Yeah.
[1295.50 --> 1296.50]  Um, yeah.
[1296.50 --> 1297.50]  It like never means anything.
[1297.50 --> 1304.50]  It's completely useless conversation, but I was a little bit surprised knowing all of that.
[1304.50 --> 1309.50]  Uh, how many people were enthusiastically wanting to line up to pay for it.
[1309.50 --> 1318.50]  Um, and I think if they made it a, I don't even know if it's prosumer potentially just straight up professional application.
[1318.50 --> 1323.50]  I think they could make a lot of money from businesses because businesses, I think.
[1323.50 --> 1333.50]  I think would like powerful 4.0 powered chat GPT reinforced employees.
[1335.50 --> 1341.50]  And you can, you look at how much these platforms are charging companies for such basic crap.
[1341.50 --> 1342.50]  Yeah.
[1342.50 --> 1343.50]  But it's worth it for the company.
[1343.50 --> 1344.50]  So they just pay it anyways.
[1344.50 --> 1345.50]  Yeah.
[1345.50 --> 1347.50]  Like the bill for teams.
[1347.50 --> 1348.50]  Yeah.
[1348.50 --> 1349.50]  Enormous.
[1349.50 --> 1350.50]  Yeah.
[1350.50 --> 1352.50]  But it's like, well, what do you think?
[1352.50 --> 1356.50]  Well, what are we going to not have like guests will pay for it?
[1356.50 --> 1358.50]  Like inter, in intra company communication.
[1358.50 --> 1360.50]  Are we just going to not have that?
[1360.50 --> 1362.50]  I guess it's, it's text chat.
[1362.50 --> 1367.50]  We're not going to have that when text chat was free like 20 years ago.
[1367.50 --> 1368.50]  I know.
[1368.50 --> 1370.50]  But we pay out the nose.
[1370.50 --> 1372.50]  Like it's really expensive.
[1372.50 --> 1373.50]  Yes.
[1373.50 --> 1374.50]  I know how much it is.
[1374.50 --> 1377.50]  It just drives me.
[1377.50 --> 1378.50]  Thank you.
[1378.50 --> 1379.50]  It's crazy to me.
[1379.50 --> 1380.50]  Don't forget.
[1380.50 --> 1381.50]  I know.
[1381.50 --> 1383.50]  I think it's like, I'm going to have to pay for G Suite and Adobe Suite and Slack and everything
[1383.50 --> 1384.50]  else.
[1384.50 --> 1385.50]  Yeah.
[1385.50 --> 1389.50]  It's, it's, it's, it's, and they're, they're, they're really expensive.
[1389.50 --> 1395.50]  So if you offered something that was actually powerful and wasn't literally a text chat that
[1395.50 --> 1396.50]  barely works.
[1396.50 --> 1397.50]  Yeah.
[1397.50 --> 1404.50]  I think people would pay a lot for it as a company, maybe not so much as a person.
[1404.50 --> 1405.50]  I don't know.
[1405.50 --> 1406.50]  Yeah.
[1406.50 --> 1411.50]  I mean, there's, cause it's all, it's kind of like how we talked about the issue with
[1411.50 --> 1416.50]  real estate, where when people are buying it to live in it, the calculus is very different
[1416.50 --> 1422.50]  compared to when people are buying it based on, uh, and pricing it based on how much money
[1422.50 --> 1423.50]  they can make from it.
[1423.50 --> 1426.50]  Like from my point of view, when I look at the cost of something, I'm looking at the cost
[1426.50 --> 1432.50]  of something, I'm looking at it in terms of how much time, which equals money it saves.
[1432.50 --> 1439.50]  So, uh, I was talking to Dan actually before the show and I was saying, Hey Dan, uh, merch
[1439.50 --> 1444.50]  messages, like, wouldn't it be cool if when merch messages come in?
[1444.50 --> 1445.50]  Okay.
[1445.50 --> 1448.50]  So when people ask a question or something like that down here, uh, when you guys see
[1448.50 --> 1452.50]  a response that is almost always from Dan, occasionally I reply to them.
[1452.50 --> 1453.50]  Do you ever reply to them?
[1453.50 --> 1454.50]  To what?
[1454.50 --> 1455.50]  Sorry.
[1455.50 --> 1456.50]  Merch messages.
[1456.50 --> 1457.50]  Originally I replied to them.
[1457.50 --> 1458.50]  I didn't know you did.
[1458.50 --> 1459.50]  Um, yeah, here's a reply.
[1459.50 --> 1460.50]  There's a reply right there.
[1460.50 --> 1462.50]  Usually that's handled by Dan.
[1462.50 --> 1466.50]  And he replies to people just from hearing us talk on the WAN show.
[1466.50 --> 1470.50]  Cause he's like always here or just from things he knows internally, he'll try to answer your
[1470.50 --> 1471.50]  questions as best he can.
[1471.50 --> 1476.50]  And I was telling Dan, I was like, Hey, A, it would save you a ton of time.
[1476.50 --> 1483.50]  And B, I think it would help you filter which ones have been addressed before versus which
[1483.50 --> 1486.50]  ones we've talked about or which ones we haven't talked about.
[1486.50 --> 1494.50]  If you could just take the transcript of every WAN show, dump it into a chat GPT prompt and
[1494.50 --> 1501.50]  then say, based on this library of information, what's the answer to this?
[1501.50 --> 1505.50]  You do a quick sanity check and then you just paste it in.
[1505.50 --> 1508.50]  It's like, Oh, you can do that.
[1508.50 --> 1509.50]  I know.
[1509.50 --> 1512.50]  Well, I know you can, but how much will it cost?
[1512.50 --> 1513.50]  Right?
[1513.50 --> 1514.50]  Yeah.
[1514.50 --> 1515.50]  Right now.
[1515.50 --> 1518.50]  Nothing, but it's, it's in a testing phase.
[1518.50 --> 1519.50]  Yeah.
[1519.50 --> 1522.50]  They've been very open about the fact that it's just in a testing phase.
[1522.50 --> 1523.50]  Yeah.
[1523.50 --> 1525.50]  But, but, and what will the tools look like for that integration?
[1525.50 --> 1531.50]  Like, will there be, will there be API access so that the merge messages dashboard will properly
[1531.50 --> 1532.50]  integrate with that?
[1532.50 --> 1539.50]  So people's questions could come in, automatically run through this process and then our dashboard
[1539.50 --> 1546.50]  could be updated so that Dan only has to see their original message and the suggested output.
[1546.50 --> 1548.50]  Oh, so there's two things.
[1548.50 --> 1552.50]  One of them, a bunch of people in chat were like, why don't you guys just run IRC?
[1552.50 --> 1553.50]  It's not the point.
[1553.50 --> 1555.50]  It's not the point.
[1555.50 --> 1556.50]  It's not the point.
[1556.50 --> 1557.50]  It's not the point.
[1557.50 --> 1559.50]  I don't even gonna explain the point.
[1559.50 --> 1561.50]  It's just not the point.
[1561.50 --> 1567.50]  And two, something that I think is going to be a really interesting reckoning is whenever
[1567.50 --> 1575.50]  chat GPT's model changes and these tools that people are building that are based on it now
[1575.50 --> 1577.50]  have to react to the model change.
[1577.50 --> 1579.50]  That's going to be interesting.
[1579.50 --> 1585.50]  I know people that have sold tools built on chat GPT for 10 K plus to companies that are
[1585.50 --> 1590.50]  trying to buy these tools that are chat GPT powered and they don't seem to understand that
[1590.50 --> 1592.50]  it's just in a testing phase.
[1592.50 --> 1594.50]  And it's going to change a lot.
[1594.50 --> 1595.50]  Something's going to happen eventually.
[1595.50 --> 1599.50]  They're going to commercialize it some way eventually.
[1599.50 --> 1600.50]  Like soon.
[1600.50 --> 1601.50]  Yeah.
[1601.50 --> 1602.50]  It seems to me.
[1602.50 --> 1609.50]  There are people making customer support bots for commercial pages right now based on
[1609.50 --> 1610.50]  chat GPT.
[1610.50 --> 1611.50]  Huh.
[1611.50 --> 1614.50]  Which like, yeah, right now, honestly, it probably works pretty good.
[1614.50 --> 1615.50]  Yeah.
[1615.50 --> 1618.50]  But when it costs you 10 cents a message or whatever that.
[1618.50 --> 1619.50]  Well, you just have no idea.
[1619.50 --> 1620.50]  Yeah.
[1620.50 --> 1621.50]  We have no clue.
[1621.50 --> 1622.50]  No clue.
[1622.50 --> 1624.50]  They might just yoink it.
[1624.50 --> 1625.50]  Right.
[1625.50 --> 1626.50]  Yeah.
[1626.50 --> 1627.50]  They might just say, hey, testing phase is over.
[1627.50 --> 1628.50]  Yeah.
[1628.50 --> 1629.50]  That's too many calls.
[1629.50 --> 1630.50]  Yeah.
[1630.50 --> 1631.50]  Or that.
[1631.50 --> 1632.50]  Yeah.
[1632.50 --> 1633.50]  Forget it.
[1633.50 --> 1634.50]  Like, I don't know.
[1634.50 --> 1637.50]  I would, I wouldn't want to do that right now.
[1637.50 --> 1639.50]  That's, that's, that's all I'm, I'm saying.
[1639.50 --> 1644.50]  Um, but there's some, there's some like pretty big, like core feature infrastructure that
[1644.50 --> 1650.50]  is being put on, uh, on, on chat GPT, which is interesting.
[1650.50 --> 1653.50]  Um, okay.
[1653.50 --> 1654.50]  Okay.
[1654.50 --> 1656.50]  Speaking of, of people missing the point.
[1656.50 --> 1663.50]  Sometimes I have an update on that thing that I said and then reversed course on.
[1663.50 --> 1665.50]  And now I'm just like, I don't know what to do.
[1665.50 --> 1666.50]  Okay.
[1666.50 --> 1671.50]  You know how I said I was just going to start, I was going to just start shadow banning people
[1671.50 --> 1674.50]  who were just like made my brain hurt.
[1674.50 --> 1676.50]  And then the next week I was like, you know what?
[1677.50 --> 1679.50]  I shadow banned like five people.
[1679.50 --> 1683.50]  And then I was like, no, this is, this is not, this isn't helping anything anyway.
[1683.50 --> 1687.50]  It's going to do nothing for improving the quality of discourse because it's an endless
[1687.50 --> 1689.50]  sea of, of bad takes or, or whatever else.
[1689.50 --> 1695.50]  And, and I don't want to create an environment where people feel like by, by expressing their
[1695.50 --> 1700.50]  thoughts, they could, you know, end up shadow banned, which is like sucky, right?
[1700.50 --> 1702.50]  Like that's never really been our approach to community feedback.
[1702.50 --> 1703.50]  Never been the goal.
[1703.50 --> 1704.50]  Never been the goal.
[1704.50 --> 1705.50]  Yeah.
[1705.50 --> 1709.50]  Well, you can, you can find a nugget of gold in a mountain of poo.
[1709.50 --> 1712.50]  And that's, that's always kind of been my philosophy about it.
[1712.50 --> 1716.50]  So I guess I better keep all the poo so that there's a chance I'll find some gold.
[1716.50 --> 1720.50]  Then the next day I read this.
[1720.50 --> 1724.50]  So this is on our 4070 TI review.
[1724.50 --> 1728.50]  Linus, Dyson made everyone post a review at the same time.
[1728.50 --> 1731.50]  We don't work with them anymore and we don't condone this behavior.
[1731.50 --> 1734.50]  Also Linus, when a new computer part launches.
[1734.50 --> 1735.50]  Yes.
[1735.50 --> 1737.50]  Corporate daddy will post at the same time as everyone.
[1737.50 --> 1741.50]  Why don't I just shadow ban that person?
[1741.50 --> 1742.50]  Why not?
[1742.50 --> 1745.50]  A, that first thing never happened.
[1745.50 --> 1748.50]  We worked with Dyson after that.
[1748.50 --> 1749.50]  The part that was bad.
[1749.50 --> 1751.50]  Yeah, we just thought it was kind of stupid.
[1751.50 --> 1752.50]  Yeah.
[1752.50 --> 1756.50]  The part that was bad was that without telling everybody that everyone else would be posting
[1756.50 --> 1759.50]  these vacuum cleaner videos at exactly the same time.
[1759.50 --> 1766.50]  They had like an embargo lift on sponsored vacuum cleaner videos and it was, it was a fiasco.
[1766.50 --> 1767.50]  A bloodbast.
[1767.50 --> 1768.50]  Yeah, it was.
[1768.50 --> 1769.50]  It was.
[1769.50 --> 1770.50]  It was.
[1770.50 --> 1771.50]  But.
[1771.50 --> 1774.50]  I never said we wouldn't work with them anymore.
[1774.50 --> 1779.50]  And I never said we don't condone a coordinated product launch.
[1779.50 --> 1784.50]  Um, also Linus, when a new computer part launches.
[1784.50 --> 1787.50]  No, it's not yes corporate daddy will post at the same time as everyone.
[1787.50 --> 1789.50]  It's yes viewer.
[1789.50 --> 1794.50]  We understand that once the news cycle is over, you're not going to watch it.
[1794.50 --> 1800.50]  Like a perfect example of this is we pushed back on separate NDA lifts for unboxings.
[1800.50 --> 1801.50]  Yeah.
[1801.50 --> 1804.50]  Um, hard when that started to materialize.
[1804.50 --> 1808.50]  I think one of the first to do it in the IT space was NVIDIA.
[1808.50 --> 1809.50]  And.
[1809.50 --> 1810.50]  I'm so surprised.
[1810.50 --> 1812.50]  I already knew that, but like, it shouldn't be surprising to anybody.
[1812.50 --> 1813.50]  Yeah.
[1813.50 --> 1814.50]  You were, you were there.
[1814.50 --> 1819.50]  You were literally there when there was like this separate unboxing embargo that who was
[1819.50 --> 1820.50]  it?
[1820.50 --> 1827.50]  Paul, I think technically didn't break because the card was just there and open and not in
[1827.50 --> 1828.50]  a box or whatever.
[1828.50 --> 1829.50]  Was that how it went down?
[1829.50 --> 1830.50]  There's something about that.
[1830.50 --> 1831.50]  It was either Paul or Kyle.
[1831.50 --> 1832.50]  It was one of them.
[1832.50 --> 1833.50]  I don't know.
[1833.50 --> 1838.50]  Uh, but the point is that, um, we pushed back hard on these, on these separate NDAs
[1838.50 --> 1843.50]  and separate embargo dates for unboxings compared to full reviews.
[1843.50 --> 1851.50]  Now I still don't mind that as much as long as the embargo lift for the full review is at
[1851.50 --> 1854.50]  the same time as sales availability.
[1854.50 --> 1858.50]  That's fine because that means before you're taking people's money, they will have an opportunity
[1858.50 --> 1861.50]  to see the product properly evaluated.
[1861.50 --> 1867.50]  But I do, um, think that a separate NDA lift for unboxings.
[1867.50 --> 1872.50]  Uh, so I mean, we're, we're up to like three NDAs for a product launch at this point.
[1872.50 --> 1874.50]  There's the announcement embargo.
[1874.50 --> 1876.50]  There's the unboxing embargo.
[1876.50 --> 1878.50]  And then there's the review embargo.
[1878.50 --> 1885.50]  And then sometimes they'll try and sneak another one in there, like, like a preview embargo where you can run specific titles or whatever else.
[1885.50 --> 1890.50]  And it's gotten kind of ridiculous, but you guys have to understand why they're doing it.
[1890.50 --> 1900.50]  It's because they are leveraging the, the short attention span or really the shortness of the news cycle to great effect.
[1900.50 --> 1908.50]  And this, this is one of those things that I just, I don't know what you guys want me to do because I don't like it.
[1909.50 --> 1913.50]  But you guys are ultimately the ones who create this game that I'm playing.
[1913.50 --> 1921.50]  I see a lot of people blame the algorithm, okay, for, uh, clickable titles and thumbnails, right?
[1922.50 --> 1927.50]  Or for the, or the proliferation of, of garbage content on YouTube.
[1927.50 --> 1934.50]  We, the people are the reason why microtransactions are so incredibly, uh, smart to put in your game.
[1934.50 --> 1938.50]  All the algorithm is, and this was, this was such a great conversation.
[1938.50 --> 1941.50]  Well, multiple conversations because I was very resistant to it at first.
[1941.50 --> 1952.50]  But, um, one of, one of my favorite contacts at YouTube, um, head of search and discovery basically has drilled into me and, and he's right.
[1953.50 --> 1963.50]  Every time you open your mouth to say something, something, algorithm, something, something, something, try replacing algorithm with the word audience.
[1963.50 --> 1971.50]  And you will find a much more, uh, you will find a much more accurate understanding of what exactly is going on.
[1972.50 --> 1974.50]  So, so this is, this is what ultimately bothered me.
[1975.50 --> 1982.50]  Um, for the launch of the 7900 XT and 7900 XTX, AMD played the game.
[1983.50 --> 1985.50]  They had two separate embargoes.
[1986.50 --> 1990.50]  One for unboxing, or well, three, right? Announcement, unboxing, and then the full review.
[1990.50 --> 1996.50]  The unboxing video, which I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna pretend that it's anything other than what it is.
[1996.50 --> 1999.50]  Uh, it's, it's low effort content, right?
[1999.50 --> 2001.50]  I've got this box.
[2002.50 --> 2003.50]  I open it.
[2004.50 --> 2005.50]  There's some specs, right?
[2006.50 --> 2013.50]  Um, I give some thoughts on it, but if I have measured the performance of it, I'm not allowed to tell you, right?
[2013.50 --> 2035.50]  We can extrapolate. I feel like we added a little bit of value to some of our, our pre-review coverage of the 7900 series by, you know, taking what AMD had provided, recreating that bench as closely as we could, and then, um, and then extrapolating, you know, how we would expect it to perform against the competition when AMD wasn't disclosing that.
[2035.50 --> 2042.50]  Like, we did everything we could with it, but at the end of the day, that's pretty shallow content.
[2042.50 --> 2060.50]  That video ended up with 1.9 million views, took a grand total of about an hour of prep time for someone to just kind of put together a spec list and, uh, you know, grab some cards, some relevant comparison cards off the shelf for me.
[2060.50 --> 2065.50]  Then, about another 40 minutes of me sitting down in front of a camera.
[2066.50 --> 2067.50]  That's it.
[2067.50 --> 2070.50]  That is the grand total time we spent on it.
[2071.50 --> 2072.50]  Okay.
[2072.50 --> 2089.50]  Then, our full review, and, you know, we gotta remember, too, that both of these are with us throwing the full power of our, you know, our wonderful thumbnail artist, Maria, and all the expertise we have internally in terms of titling videos and, uh, you know, trying to get a lot of stuff.
[2089.50 --> 2092.50]  Uh, you know, trying to create catchy intros and all that kind of stuff.
[2092.50 --> 2098.50]  Uh, our full review ended up with a whopping 1.9 million views.
[2098.50 --> 2101.50]  Now, that doesn't sound like a problem, right?
[2101.50 --> 2102.50]  Yeah, okay.
[2102.50 --> 2108.50]  So, the unboxing and the review ended up with similar view counts, except for a couple of things.
[2108.50 --> 2120.50]  Number one is that that review is, in my humble opinion, the second best GPU review we've ever done, followed only by the 4070 Ti.
[2120.50 --> 2126.50]  And that's only because it came a little bit later once we'd had, once we got our workflow settled in a little bit better.
[2126.50 --> 2132.50]  Um, and number two, it's on a way bigger channel.
[2132.50 --> 2134.50]  Like, way bigger.
[2134.50 --> 2137.50]  And I'm just, I don't know, man.
[2137.50 --> 2140.50]  I'm, I feel like I'm rambling a little bit now at this point.
[2140.50 --> 2146.50]  I'm just, I'm kind of bothered by how many people look at that short circuit video, which we never call a review.
[2146.50 --> 2149.50]  We never, we never put a review in the description.
[2149.50 --> 2150.50]  I never say review in the video.
[2150.50 --> 2153.50]  The number of people that think it's a review.
[2153.50 --> 2170.50]  And just the appetite for, for deeper, more analytical content is, is just not there compared to just this, this, this surface level, surface level content.
[2170.50 --> 2176.50]  So where, how did I, how did I arrive here?
[2176.50 --> 2177.50]  I don't remember.
[2177.50 --> 2181.50]  We were talking about the comment and how you wanted to remove it.
[2181.50 --> 2182.50]  Cause it's annoying.
[2182.50 --> 2183.50]  Uh, yeah.
[2183.50 --> 2184.50]  Okay.
[2184.50 --> 2185.50]  I don't remember.
[2185.50 --> 2186.50]  Just bad faith arguments like that.
[2186.50 --> 2187.50]  It's really frustrating.
[2187.50 --> 2188.50]  Yeah.
[2188.50 --> 2189.50]  There you go.
[2189.50 --> 2200.50]  Um, well, I mean, I think it's like, you're, you're screwed if you do and you screwed if you don't.
[2200.50 --> 2201.50]  Yeah.
[2201.50 --> 2211.50]  Because I mean, there's no, you know, unless I were to, unless I were to publish some kind of, you know, official, like, you know, policy, like, like a, like a code of conduct by which I decide to, you know, I'm not going to do that.
[2211.50 --> 2212.50]  I'm not going to do that.
[2212.50 --> 2213.50]  I'm not going to do that.
[2213.50 --> 2214.50]  I'm not going to do that.
[2214.50 --> 2224.50]  I read a particularly frustrating thread on the forum, uh, either today or yesterday, uh, where there, there were a number of people making, again, these just extraordinarily bad faith arguments.
[2224.50 --> 2226.50]  In this case, it was about the screwdriver in the backpack.
[2226.50 --> 2242.02]  And, uh, one in particular wrote this wall of text about this long after someone challenged them because what they said before was I could go on AliExpress and get that screwdriver in that backpack for a fraction of the price.
[2242.02 --> 2245.02]  The cost on that screwdriver is like this low.
[2245.02 --> 2248.02]  And someone was like, okay, then do, do it.
[2248.02 --> 2249.02]  Show me.
[2249.02 --> 2251.02]  And they wrote this wall of text.
[2251.02 --> 2257.02]  I'm not going to bother because it's not worth my time, but here's all the like knowledge I have about how that.
[2257.02 --> 2261.02]  So I replied, I was just like, I will give you 10 grand.
[2261.02 --> 2264.02]  I will give you $10,000.
[2264.02 --> 2265.02]  If you can do that.
[2265.02 --> 2266.02]  It's worth your time now.
[2266.02 --> 2268.02]  It's worth your time now.
[2268.02 --> 2269.02]  It's just on AliExpress.
[2269.02 --> 2270.02]  Where's your excuse?
[2270.02 --> 2271.02]  Yeah.
[2271.02 --> 2289.02]  And it's just like, I don't know how to, I don't know how to have a conversation when the person on the other side of the table is, is not capable of existing in the same plane of reality that I'm in.
[2289.02 --> 2296.02]  You know, they say I can get that screwdriver for $10 and I say, you cannot.
[2296.02 --> 2299.02]  Would you like to reevaluate your position?
[2299.02 --> 2300.02]  No, thank you.
[2304.02 --> 2306.02]  And I don't know, I don't know how to deal with that.
[2306.02 --> 2308.02]  You know?
[2308.02 --> 2309.02]  Yeah.
[2309.02 --> 2312.02]  It's like, what do you want from me?
[2312.02 --> 2315.02]  Do you need my invoices from MegaPro?
[2315.02 --> 2317.02]  From PH molds?
[2317.02 --> 2319.02]  From ITD Tool and Die?
[2319.02 --> 2325.02]  From, do you, do you, like we're, we're pretty transparent actually.
[2325.02 --> 2328.02]  Someone's asking if they can enter the contest.
[2328.02 --> 2329.02]  You can't do it.
[2329.02 --> 2330.02]  Go for it.
[2330.02 --> 2331.02]  You can't.
[2331.02 --> 2332.02]  That's the whole point.
[2332.02 --> 2335.02]  There is no, there is no AliExpress vendor.
[2335.02 --> 2344.02]  Those handles are, are, are injection molded in Pit Meadows, or excuse me, Maple Ridge, British Columbia.
[2344.02 --> 2346.02]  Like, you can't.
[2346.02 --> 2348.02]  It just doesn't work that way.
[2348.02 --> 2349.02]  It's not a thing.
[2349.02 --> 2352.02]  You're missing the point, my dude.
[2352.02 --> 2359.02]  And it's like, it's one of those things where, you know, if you were willing to open your eyes, and open your mind, you would know.
[2359.02 --> 2369.02]  I mean, we have footage of me in the injection molding facility, hand building screwdrivers, here.
[2369.02 --> 2370.02]  You know?
[2371.02 --> 2374.02]  Ah, I just, I can't.
[2374.02 --> 2375.02]  So, so.
[2375.02 --> 2377.02]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2377.02 --> 2378.02]  No, keep going.
[2378.02 --> 2379.02]  I was trying to derail us, so if you have more to say.
[2379.02 --> 2380.02]  No, I mean, no, it's great.
[2380.02 --> 2384.02]  I mean, honestly, like, obviously you guys are, you guys are the Wancho audience.
[2384.02 --> 2385.02]  You guys, you guys get it.
[2385.02 --> 2388.02]  And you're, you've got my best interests at heart, I think.
[2388.02 --> 2390.02]  And you're sitting here going, Linus, don't engage.
[2390.02 --> 2392.02]  And, you're right.
[2392.02 --> 2409.02]  But, the thing that you haven't experienced, and, you know, one of the reasons that, honestly, you know, Luke, or, or the other people internally here, or my fellow YouTubers, or some of the only people that I feel like I can really talk to about these things, is that.
[2409.02 --> 2421.02]  You've never experienced these thousands or hundreds or even dozens of attacks that come.
[2421.02 --> 2424.02]  And you're not allowed to defend generally.
[2424.02 --> 2428.02]  And you guys are basically saying, don't defend yourself.
[2428.02 --> 2431.02]  But the thing is, is that it doesn't go away.
[2431.02 --> 2435.02]  And in some cases, what can happen is it can even grow.
[2435.02 --> 2446.88]  And so, you know, I'm kind of looking at it going, you know, okay, a perfect example is when we had that, when we had that, that, that sexual assault accusation, right?
[2446.88 --> 2458.88]  And I basically took the very controversial, internally, move of kind of going, okay, here is my entire relationship history.
[2458.88 --> 2460.88]  Start to finish.
[2460.88 --> 2463.88]  The only part that was controversial with me was the details.
[2465.88 --> 2467.88]  I didn't, I didn't need to know it tasted like smoke.
[2468.88 --> 2470.88]  I will never forget that.
[2470.88 --> 2471.88]  I just thought it was kind of funny.
[2472.88 --> 2473.88]  For that one.
[2473.88 --> 2475.88]  It was, it was the most memorable thing about it.
[2475.88 --> 2479.88]  Sorry, keep going.
[2479.88 --> 2484.88]  So I took the controversial move of basically going, okay, fine, then, you know, full transparency.
[2484.88 --> 2485.88]  Here's everything.
[2485.88 --> 2491.88]  So anything that doesn't match that, I will not be acknowledging because that didn't happen.
[2491.88 --> 2494.88]  So now I don't have to talk about it anymore.
[2494.88 --> 2503.88]  But like, there's, there's this, there's kind of this contingent that refuses to acknowledge any sort of, you know, fact or reality.
[2503.88 --> 2507.88]  And is always just kind of, I mean, haters going to hate, I guess is the bottom line.
[2507.88 --> 2508.88]  And it wears on you.
[2508.88 --> 2509.88]  Yeah.
[2509.88 --> 2510.88]  Like it really does.
[2510.88 --> 2512.88]  And you want to do something about it.
[2512.88 --> 2522.88]  And like, this happened, this happened on my, on my tour of, of OVH, but there was the, um,
[2524.88 --> 2525.88]  do, do, do, do, do.
[2525.88 --> 2526.88]  Let me see.
[2527.88 --> 2528.88]  Yeah.
[2528.88 --> 2529.88]  The RTX 6000.
[2529.88 --> 2538.88]  And like, whose fault is it that there's a card called the RTX 6000?
[2538.88 --> 2542.88]  It's, well, it's Nvidia's fault, but I had to say it in the video.
[2542.88 --> 2545.88]  And I knew when I said it that people are going to go, huh?
[2545.88 --> 2554.88]  And there's all the, and this is so light and who cares, but there's all these comments everywhere on float plane on, on YouTube, on everything.
[2554.88 --> 2555.88]  What an idiot.
[2556.88 --> 2557.88]  That card doesn't exist.
[2557.88 --> 2558.88]  What a dummy.
[2558.88 --> 2559.88]  What a dummy.
[2559.88 --> 2563.88]  And the whole time, every single, and this is so light compared to what he's talking about.
[2563.88 --> 2570.88]  But every single time I read that, I'm just like, man, like you, ah, there's a bunch of parts of the video that are not that great.
[2570.88 --> 2571.88]  Like you can call me out on that.
[2572.88 --> 2574.88]  But why are you calling me out on this?
[2575.88 --> 2576.88]  Duh!
[2576.88 --> 2578.88]  And then I want to respond to every single one of them.
[2578.88 --> 2580.88]  And then it's just like, okay, no, I need to not do this.
[2580.88 --> 2581.88]  Yeah.
[2581.88 --> 2582.88]  And it, it, it bothers you, right?
[2582.88 --> 2589.88]  Because like, especially in cases where you, you know, it was, you know, you were right.
[2590.88 --> 2598.88]  Um, you just kind of go, well now, now you're going to sit and think that forever.
[2598.88 --> 2599.88]  Yeah.
[2599.88 --> 2603.88]  And given that our entire job is trying to inform people about technology.
[2603.88 --> 2613.88]  I, I, I just like, I could sit at my keyboard all day, correcting misconceptions, literally all day and do absolutely nothing else.
[2613.88 --> 2614.88]  That'd be a funny video.
[2615.88 --> 2622.88]  I mean, we've done Linus responds to haters, I guess, or no, we've done Linus responds to mean comments.
[2622.88 --> 2625.88]  You should do like the thumbnails, like you pointing at the screen.
[2625.88 --> 2627.88]  It just says you're wrong is the thumbnail.
[2627.88 --> 2628.88]  But here's the problem.
[2628.88 --> 2636.88]  So we, um, I guess about, about six months ago, we created, um, well, I shouldn't say we, James created,
[2636.88 --> 2637.88]  it doesn't matter.
[2637.88 --> 2638.88]  The timeline doesn't matter.
[2638.88 --> 2642.88]  Sometime in the last little while, James created a document called how to make good videos.
[2642.88 --> 2651.88]  And in how to make good videos, um, he created a section based on a conversation that we had had called the laws of Linus.
[2651.88 --> 2663.88]  And there's a bunch of really interesting stuff in here that I have, even though not all of it is actually from me, it was a, it was a team effort building, building it.
[2663.88 --> 2672.88]  And I probably wouldn't have called it that just cause it's sort of a silly, uh, thing, but it's got, he put a flex on acronym, right?
[2672.88 --> 2673.88]  Yeah, I guess so.
[2673.88 --> 2674.88]  Sure.
[2674.88 --> 2675.88]  Yeah.
[2675.88 --> 2679.88]  The lols, the lols, got them.
[2679.88 --> 2681.88]  Really did like you better when you couldn't talk.
[2681.88 --> 2683.88]  It's a better show that way.
[2683.88 --> 2684.88]  So.
[2684.88 --> 2687.88]  It was a little disheartening how many people were like, this was the best show.
[2687.88 --> 2688.88]  I was like, alright.
[2688.88 --> 2690.88]  Yeah, speaking of haters.
[2690.88 --> 2697.88]  Okay, I have to tell you though, and this is the first time I'm telling him on air, but I told you after the show last week as well.
[2697.88 --> 2708.88]  It is actually far more helpful than you and you guys probably realize to have a friendly presence.
[2708.88 --> 2718.88]  Like essentially a living, breathing laugh track slash supporter just sitting next to you while you ramble on and on about things.
[2718.88 --> 2723.88]  Kind of nodding or raising an eyebrow when you say something stupid.
[2723.88 --> 2729.88]  Like I can imagine at the height of the pandemic, you know, being an athlete, performing in an empty stadium.
[2729.88 --> 2730.88]  Yeah.
[2730.88 --> 2732.88]  You know, I don't know.
[2732.88 --> 2734.88]  Did, did, did I play that shot good?
[2734.88 --> 2735.88]  Yeah.
[2735.88 --> 2738.88]  Like there's no feedback whatsoever.
[2738.88 --> 2739.88]  Yeah.
[2739.88 --> 2740.88]  And it really does.
[2740.88 --> 2741.88]  It really does get you going.
[2741.88 --> 2743.88]  Anyway, back to the laws of Linus.
[2743.88 --> 2748.88]  One of the laws is never insult the audience.
[2748.88 --> 2750.88]  It doesn't go well.
[2750.88 --> 2751.88]  Yeah.
[2751.88 --> 2752.88]  And I do it from time to time.
[2752.88 --> 2753.88]  I break the rules.
[2753.88 --> 2761.88]  You know, someone on, I honestly feel more liberated with the float plane audience because realistically they pay for the subscription.
[2761.88 --> 2762.88]  They're probably hardcore.
[2762.88 --> 2763.88]  They can probably handle it.
[2763.88 --> 2768.88]  And you know, every once in a while, you know, there'll be a brain dead enough take that I'm just like, you know what?
[2768.88 --> 2771.88]  No, we're going to, we're going to talk about this because that's, that's pretty bad.
[2771.88 --> 2775.88]  But I shouldn't, I shouldn't because, hold on.
[2775.88 --> 2777.88]  I'm trying to find the bloody part of it.
[2777.88 --> 2779.88]  This is driving me absolutely crazy.
[2779.88 --> 2780.88]  Okay, fine.
[2780.88 --> 2782.88]  I will resort to find and replace.
[2782.88 --> 2786.88]  Uh, is it insult or no, it must be attack.
[2786.88 --> 2787.88]  Guys, I'm, I'm fine.
[2787.88 --> 2788.88]  You don't have to.
[2788.88 --> 2790.88]  Yeah, here it is.
[2790.88 --> 2795.88]  Do not personally attack the viewer no matter how wrong or stupid their beliefs are, not even an implied attack.
[2795.88 --> 2813.88]  And this has actually helped us a lot over the last little while because there have been a few videos where we, you know, we'd make an offhand joke, say for example, about like DDR2 memory, you know, being old.
[2813.88 --> 2816.88]  And it's like, well, hold on a second.
[2816.88 --> 2821.88]  In a lot of parts of the world, DDR2 is like still expensive and still current.
[2821.88 --> 2841.80]  And it's easy to live in our, in our North American bubble and to, and it's not even necessarily wrong to live in our North American bubble because that's where solid, like almost 60% of our viewership comes from with probably another 30% from, you know, Western, Western Europe.
[2841.80 --> 2845.80]  So like your Germany's and, and UK's and France's of the world, places like that.
[2845.80 --> 2847.80]  Um, yeah.
[2847.80 --> 2866.80]  But you've got to understand that when you are broadcasting to literally millions of people, if only 1% of them are personally attacked by what you say, then you just upset a thousand, 10,000 people for what?
[2866.80 --> 2867.80]  Yeah.
[2867.80 --> 2868.80]  Why?
[2868.80 --> 2869.80]  To what end?
[2869.80 --> 2870.80]  Yeah.
[2870.80 --> 2871.80]  Like why?
[2871.80 --> 2880.80]  So one of the things that I'll do during script review with people now is I'll say like, Hey, um, why are we poking fun at people who liked windows Vista?
[2880.80 --> 2882.80]  That's just, just an example.
[2882.80 --> 2884.80]  Why are we doing that?
[2884.80 --> 2885.80]  And they're like, cause it's funny.
[2885.80 --> 2886.80]  Cause they're dumb.
[2886.80 --> 2889.80]  I'm like, well, a, I like windows Vista.
[2889.80 --> 2892.80]  Not so funny now, is it?
[2892.80 --> 2897.80]  But that's not even the point because B, who cares?
[2897.80 --> 2898.80]  Is there a benefit?
[2898.80 --> 2899.80]  Yeah.
[2899.80 --> 2900.80]  Yeah.
[2900.80 --> 2909.80]  And honestly, this is something where Yvonne has been a really good influence on me because she has basically said, Hey, look, I think that you're too aggro.
[2909.80 --> 2914.80]  And I think that you're going to catch a lot more flies with honey than with vinegar.
[2914.80 --> 2916.80]  And she's, she's right.
[2916.80 --> 2921.80]  I have basically never one.
[2921.80 --> 2932.80]  I shouldn't say I, I shouldn't say I, I have never, I, I have rarely witnessed like an aggressive approach winning an argument on the internet.
[2932.80 --> 2934.80]  Think about it.
[2934.80 --> 2938.80]  I, so I, I agree with the statement in general.
[2938.80 --> 2943.80]  I think sometimes it is not.
[2943.80 --> 2944.80]  Okay.
[2944.80 --> 2945.80]  Okay.
[2945.80 --> 2946.80]  Okay.
[2946.80 --> 2947.80]  So this is, this is a tech channel.
[2947.80 --> 2948.80]  We're talking about tech topics.
[2948.80 --> 2949.80]  Yeah.
[2949.80 --> 2952.80]  So it should basically always be honey because who cares?
[2952.80 --> 2953.80]  Sure.
[2953.80 --> 2955.80]  But I don't think this applies to all arguments.
[2955.80 --> 2958.80]  One could have, if that makes sense.
[2962.80 --> 2963.80]  We've talked about this before.
[2963.80 --> 2968.80]  I don't remember how I phrased it, but I think it was like, sometimes you want to catch them with the vinegar or whatever.
[2968.80 --> 2977.80]  Like I, there's certain times where like, I'm not willing to acknowledge any potential benefits of the argument on the other side.
[2977.80 --> 2979.80]  So I'm not going to approach it with honey.
[2979.80 --> 2981.80]  But you don't have to acknowledge merit.
[2981.80 --> 2987.80]  You don't have to acknowledge any merit of their argument when there isn't any, but you could acknowledge maybe how they feel.
[2989.80 --> 2990.80]  No.
[2990.80 --> 2991.80]  Okay.
[2991.80 --> 2994.80]  There's certain, there are certain arguments where I, I think no.
[2994.80 --> 2995.80]  That's fair.
[2995.80 --> 2996.80]  I don't know.
[2996.80 --> 2997.80]  Intolerance will not be tolerated.
[2997.80 --> 2998.80]  Yeah.
[2998.80 --> 2999.80]  Yes.
[2999.80 --> 3000.80]  I mean, that's fair enough.
[3000.80 --> 3009.80]  What we will also not tolerate is AI art generators blatantly ripping off the source material on which they were trained.
[3009.80 --> 3010.80]  That's right.
[3010.80 --> 3011.80]  I called this.
[3011.80 --> 3017.80]  There is already a two major copyright lawsuits against AI art generators.
[3017.80 --> 3023.80]  Getty Images claims that Stability AI scraped the Getty Images site using it as a database to train its own data.
[3023.80 --> 3024.80]  AI art generator.
[3024.80 --> 3025.80]  Um.
[3025.80 --> 3026.80]  Um.
[3026.80 --> 3038.80]  These claims are corroborated by an independent study that found that Stability AI was trained on hundreds of thousands of images sourced from stock image sites.
[3038.80 --> 3045.80]  Notably, Stability AI has a funny habit of recreating the Getty Images watermark in the images that it produces.
[3045.80 --> 3046.80]  And this is, uh, figure two down below.
[3046.80 --> 3047.80]  This is actually hilarious.
[3047.80 --> 3048.80]  This is hilarious.
[3048.80 --> 3049.80]  That's really funny.
[3049.80 --> 3050.80]  Um.
[3050.80 --> 3051.80]  Whoops.
[3051.80 --> 3052.80]  This is a super weird image.
[3052.80 --> 3053.80]  It is.
[3053.80 --> 3054.80]  único.
[3054.80 --> 3055.80]  Developed to asian graphic benefactes.
[3055.80 --> 3056.80]  Um.

[3059.80 --> 3060.80]  The similarities Uno超.
[3060.80 --> 3061.80]  witnessed an footage in the Marketing Core.
[3061.80 --> 3062.80]  Have you seen any of those 따라ssä fan statements?
[3062.80 --> 3063.80]  Last one at p-stateHelp榛 blotiets?
[3063.80 --> 3064.78]  We're Shadow UI approaches a single director with a T- Troy.

[3065.80 --> 3066.80] ції of the other Componsies platform,ryup.
[3066.80 --> 3067.80]  And you also go ahead.
[3067.80 --> 3068.80]  This is a super weird image.
[3068.80 --> 3069.80]  And you also know, watchactorily range of the Clearly见CE- moyen, 국er Jon and reminded us see easily
[3069.80 --> 3072.76]  um whoops
[3072.76 --> 3078.76]  this is a super weird image
[3078.76 --> 3080.72]  is this supposed to be like
[3080.72 --> 3082.84]  a baseball catcher
[3082.84 --> 3084.16]  it looks like baseball mixed with football
[3084.16 --> 3085.64]  it really does
[3085.64 --> 3089.46]  I do have to wonder what the prompt was
[3089.46 --> 3091.72]  also I kind of have to wonder
[3091.72 --> 3094.78]  what kind of roids this guy's got going on here
[3094.78 --> 3097.94]  though if you take steroids
[3097.94 --> 3099.46]  that is your own life choice
[3099.46 --> 3101.10]  don't be upset
[3101.10 --> 3103.80]  not insulting the audience I like it
[3103.80 --> 3106.66]  I actually just don't care
[3106.66 --> 3108.80]  like if that's what you want to do to your testicles
[3108.80 --> 3109.32]  then like
[3109.32 --> 3115.00]  mine are bigger
[3115.00 --> 3120.06]  okay I break my rules sometimes
[3120.06 --> 3122.06]  might be short but he's got them big ones
[3122.06 --> 3126.96]  um
[3126.96 --> 3129.86]  a study from the university of maryland
[3129.86 --> 3130.70]  strong beef
[3130.70 --> 3136.30]  found that stable diffusion can sometimes end up closely replicating images from its training database
[3136.30 --> 3141.76]  these aren't pixel perfect copies but the derivation is pretty blatant
[3141.76 --> 3144.66]  that is figure one over here where um
[3144.66 --> 3145.92]  yep
[3145.92 --> 3149.04]  I don't think it takes a genius
[3149.04 --> 3151.10]  to uh to see that
[3151.10 --> 3154.96]  there's a relationship here
[3154.96 --> 3155.82]  yeah
[3155.82 --> 3157.56]  I mean you can't even
[3157.56 --> 3159.88]  you can't even move the wolves around a little bit
[3159.88 --> 3161.64]  where's the moon
[3161.64 --> 3163.46]  give me three wolves and a moon
[3163.46 --> 3163.98]  you know
[3163.98 --> 3165.82]  give me something to work with here
[3165.82 --> 3167.06]  make it defensible
[3167.06 --> 3168.20]  um
[3168.20 --> 3169.62]  the second major lawsuit
[3169.62 --> 3170.74]  is a class action
[3170.74 --> 3172.14]  against stability AI
[3172.14 --> 3172.70]  uh
[3172.70 --> 3173.20]  deviant art
[3173.20 --> 3174.24]  and mid journey
[3174.24 --> 3175.96]  claiming that their art generators
[3175.96 --> 3176.74]  are simply
[3176.74 --> 3178.70]  remixing the copyrighted works
[3178.70 --> 3180.00]  of millions of artists
[3180.00 --> 3181.28]  the lawsuit's website
[3181.28 --> 3182.94]  calls such AI generators
[3182.94 --> 3185.88]  21st century collage tools
[3185.88 --> 3187.84]  and it's an interesting thing
[3187.84 --> 3188.40]  because
[3188.40 --> 3190.62]  like the
[3190.62 --> 3191.78]  like the bloodborne one
[3191.78 --> 3192.36]  for instance
[3192.36 --> 3193.30]  if
[3193.30 --> 3194.62]  the lower image
[3194.62 --> 3196.74]  which I believe is the AI generated image
[3196.74 --> 3198.02]  I think
[3198.02 --> 3200.06]  I actually don't know
[3200.06 --> 3201.16]  I actually don't know
[3201.16 --> 3201.76]  um
[3201.76 --> 3202.18]  but I
[3202.18 --> 3203.24]  it kind of doesn't matter
[3203.24 --> 3204.84]  because they're similar enough to each other
[3204.84 --> 3205.62]  that it's irrelevant
[3205.62 --> 3206.68]  and that's sort of the point
[3206.68 --> 3206.86]  so
[3206.86 --> 3207.12]  yeah
[3207.12 --> 3209.08]  say the AI generated image
[3209.08 --> 3210.28]  is used for
[3210.28 --> 3210.94]  uh
[3210.94 --> 3212.38]  let's say a mobile game
[3212.38 --> 3213.66]  right
[3213.66 --> 3214.00]  if
[3214.00 --> 3214.96]  if it was called
[3214.96 --> 3215.88]  um
[3215.88 --> 3217.92]  white blood cell
[3217.92 --> 3219.46]  birth
[3219.46 --> 3220.84]  and it was on
[3220.84 --> 3222.38]  the Apple store
[3222.38 --> 3223.34]  they
[3223.34 --> 3225.48]  would probably be gone after
[3225.48 --> 3226.74]  because their bloodborne
[3226.74 --> 3227.04]  would say
[3227.04 --> 3228.08]  that's too close to our logo
[3228.08 --> 3229.06]  because you just clearly
[3229.06 --> 3229.84]  ripped off our logo
[3229.84 --> 3230.10]  right
[3230.10 --> 3231.42]  yeah
[3231.42 --> 3233.06]  so it's the same thing
[3233.06 --> 3234.14]  and like
[3234.14 --> 3234.84]  I uh
[3234.84 --> 3236.48]  I've been caught in this argument
[3236.48 --> 3236.98]  a little bit
[3236.98 --> 3237.66]  because I went
[3237.66 --> 3238.62]  anti
[3238.62 --> 3239.84]  AI art
[3239.84 --> 3241.06]  and I went pro
[3241.06 --> 3241.54]  AI
[3241.54 --> 3243.06]  large language model
[3243.06 --> 3244.62]  and people didn't like
[3244.62 --> 3245.42]  that I was kind of
[3245.42 --> 3246.78]  on each side of the fence
[3246.78 --> 3248.60]  but this is kind of the example
[3248.60 --> 3250.26]  and I don't know
[3250.26 --> 3250.84]  100%
[3250.84 --> 3251.82]  really
[3251.82 --> 3252.72]  where
[3252.72 --> 3254.54]  it ends up being okay
[3254.54 --> 3255.58]  because it's still
[3255.58 --> 3256.40]  100% true
[3256.40 --> 3257.50]  that the large language model
[3257.50 --> 3259.10]  is trained off of other people's stuff
[3259.10 --> 3260.22]  it's not
[3260.22 --> 3260.90]  not true
[3260.90 --> 3261.74]  that that is a thing
[3261.74 --> 3262.66]  but
[3262.66 --> 3264.08]  it's a lot less apparent
[3264.08 --> 3266.66]  it's way less apparent
[3266.66 --> 3268.32]  you don't have it do this
[3268.32 --> 3269.56]  you can get
[3269.56 --> 3270.22]  chat GPT
[3270.22 --> 3271.14]  to spit out things
[3271.14 --> 3272.04]  that other people have written
[3272.04 --> 3272.82]  it's happened
[3272.82 --> 3274.48]  but it's not as egregious
[3274.48 --> 3275.42]  doesn't seem as common
[3275.42 --> 3277.50]  stuff like that
[3277.50 --> 3278.70]  it seems like it's done
[3278.70 --> 3279.86]  better
[3279.86 --> 3280.68]  but
[3280.68 --> 3281.76]  it also seems like
[3281.76 --> 3282.52]  it was easier
[3282.52 --> 3283.40]  to do it better
[3283.40 --> 3285.60]  because it's a large language model
[3285.60 --> 3286.26]  and the way that works
[3286.26 --> 3286.76]  is easier
[3286.76 --> 3288.44]  but when it comes to art
[3288.44 --> 3289.04]  we're seeing
[3289.04 --> 3290.20]  a lot of this
[3290.20 --> 3292.02]  I had the example
[3292.02 --> 3293.18]  that I gave in the previous way
[3293.18 --> 3294.24]  and showing these three examples
[3294.24 --> 3294.54]  are
[3294.54 --> 3296.54]  just as blatant
[3296.54 --> 3297.72]  I mean
[3297.72 --> 3298.78]  here's the thing though
[3298.78 --> 3301.22]  are people
[3301.22 --> 3303.12]  they're
[3303.12 --> 3304.16]  okay
[3304.16 --> 3304.90]  I'm
[3304.90 --> 3305.96]  I'm gonna ask
[3305.96 --> 3306.62]  I'm gonna ask
[3306.62 --> 3307.48]  a spicy question
[3307.48 --> 3310.06]  does it matter
[3310.06 --> 3311.88]  what the law is
[3311.88 --> 3313.38]  if the overall
[3313.38 --> 3314.78]  social benefit
[3314.78 --> 3316.30]  outweighs
[3316.30 --> 3317.06]  the drawback
[3317.06 --> 3318.24]  to
[3318.24 --> 3319.12]  to those few
[3319.12 --> 3320.24]  who are affected by it
[3320.24 --> 3321.58]  and
[3321.58 --> 3322.24]  to be clear
[3322.24 --> 3323.10]  I'm not taking
[3323.10 --> 3324.10]  the position
[3324.10 --> 3324.66]  that
[3324.66 --> 3325.30]  you know
[3325.30 --> 3326.12]  the ends justify
[3326.12 --> 3326.78]  the means here
[3326.78 --> 3328.24]  I'm just asking
[3328.24 --> 3331.18]  if we all collectively
[3331.18 --> 3332.24]  kind of decide
[3332.24 --> 3333.90]  this is okay
[3333.90 --> 3335.40]  because it has to be okay
[3335.40 --> 3336.04]  because
[3336.04 --> 3337.74]  this is really convenient
[3337.74 --> 3338.48]  for our lives
[3338.48 --> 3339.18]  that we can
[3339.18 --> 3339.80]  you know
[3339.80 --> 3341.00]  create a children's book
[3341.00 --> 3341.76]  from scratch
[3341.76 --> 3342.38]  in a weekend
[3342.38 --> 3344.76]  without needing an illustrator
[3344.76 --> 3346.46]  because we never learned to draw
[3346.46 --> 3350.36]  is this ultimately going to fizzle out
[3350.36 --> 3351.50]  and are these lawsuits
[3351.50 --> 3352.34]  going to just
[3352.34 --> 3353.56]  eventually go away
[3353.56 --> 3354.92]  I don't think that's the average stance
[3354.92 --> 3355.12]  though
[3355.12 --> 3356.00]  so I don't think it would
[3356.00 --> 3357.58]  well
[3357.58 --> 3359.12]  it's not the average stance
[3359.12 --> 3359.80]  now
[3359.80 --> 3361.96]  but most people
[3361.96 --> 3363.06]  have not used
[3363.06 --> 3364.58]  an AI image generator yet
[3364.58 --> 3366.38]  once people get used
[3366.38 --> 3367.26]  to the convenience
[3367.26 --> 3368.88]  of an AI image generator
[3368.88 --> 3369.96]  will they be willing
[3369.96 --> 3370.78]  to let it go
[3370.78 --> 3373.62]  ooh
[3373.62 --> 3374.72]  yeah
[3374.72 --> 3375.84]  my pessimism
[3375.84 --> 3376.76]  would say no
[3376.76 --> 3377.40]  right
[3377.40 --> 3377.72]  like
[3377.72 --> 3378.40]  I mean
[3378.40 --> 3379.12]  okay
[3379.12 --> 3381.48]  another perfect example
[3381.48 --> 3381.98]  of
[3381.98 --> 3383.02]  sometimes
[3383.02 --> 3384.10]  the gulf
[3384.10 --> 3385.14]  that exists
[3385.14 --> 3385.88]  between
[3385.88 --> 3386.66]  what is
[3386.66 --> 3387.80]  ethical
[3387.80 --> 3388.62]  and
[3388.62 --> 3389.72]  legally
[3389.72 --> 3390.78]  acceptable
[3390.78 --> 3392.08]  versus what is
[3392.08 --> 3393.58]  socially acceptable
[3393.58 --> 3395.42]  would be something like
[3395.42 --> 3396.44]  the way that
[3396.44 --> 3397.02]  some creators
[3397.02 --> 3397.46]  approach
[3397.46 --> 3398.20]  react content
[3398.20 --> 3399.14]  and
[3399.14 --> 3399.88]  I know
[3399.88 --> 3400.50]  this is going to
[3400.50 --> 3402.14]  be a hot
[3402.14 --> 3402.82]  spicy potato
[3402.82 --> 3403.52]  this is going to be
[3403.52 --> 3404.52]  a hot take
[3404.52 --> 3405.30]  I can't believe
[3405.30 --> 3406.02]  he's talking about this
[3406.02 --> 3406.56]  but it's like
[3406.56 --> 3406.88]  it's
[3406.88 --> 3407.96]  it's actually
[3407.96 --> 3409.24]  pretty cut and dried
[3409.24 --> 3409.88]  right
[3409.88 --> 3410.58]  like
[3410.58 --> 3411.62]  I'm not gonna
[3411.62 --> 3412.20]  I'm not gonna
[3412.20 --> 3412.88]  there's no point
[3412.88 --> 3414.00]  not being transparent
[3414.00 --> 3414.48]  about it
[3414.48 --> 3414.86]  because
[3414.86 --> 3415.72]  the internet
[3415.72 --> 3416.70]  never forgets anything
[3416.70 --> 3417.84]  so I might as well
[3417.84 --> 3418.48]  just tell you guys
[3418.48 --> 3419.64]  we're working on a react channel
[3419.64 --> 3420.68]  like it's
[3420.68 --> 3420.92]  it
[3420.92 --> 3422.30]  it is
[3422.30 --> 3424.52]  f***ing effort
[3424.52 --> 3425.98]  f***ing
[3425.98 --> 3427.66]  easy content
[3427.66 --> 3429.14]  and it is
[3429.14 --> 3429.58]  like
[3429.58 --> 3430.92]  obscenely
[3430.92 --> 3432.60]  obscenely
[3432.60 --> 3433.16]  profitable
[3433.16 --> 3434.28]  if you can
[3434.28 --> 3435.26]  generate a bunch
[3435.26 --> 3435.86]  of views
[3435.86 --> 3436.82]  on content
[3436.82 --> 3437.42]  that takes
[3437.42 --> 3438.64]  almost literally
[3438.64 --> 3439.30]  no time
[3439.30 --> 3440.14]  that's what it is
[3440.14 --> 3440.80]  that's what react
[3440.80 --> 3441.54]  content is
[3441.54 --> 3443.22]  and
[3443.22 --> 3444.30]  what's your approach
[3444.30 --> 3444.70]  to the
[3444.70 --> 3446.06]  I'm very intrigued
[3446.06 --> 3447.02]  what is the approach
[3447.02 --> 3447.86]  to the react content
[3447.86 --> 3448.24]  channel
[3448.24 --> 3449.24]  well first I'm gonna
[3449.24 --> 3449.82]  talk about
[3449.82 --> 3450.16]  you know
[3450.16 --> 3450.98]  what are the
[3450.98 --> 3451.78]  what are the obvious
[3451.78 --> 3452.84]  problems with some
[3452.84 --> 3453.62]  of the react content
[3453.62 --> 3454.26]  that's out there
[3454.26 --> 3455.66]  the defense that is
[3455.66 --> 3456.36]  used by
[3456.36 --> 3457.30]  and I'm not gonna
[3457.30 --> 3457.82]  name anyone
[3457.82 --> 3458.60]  because I just don't
[3458.60 --> 3459.18]  I don't need any
[3459.18 --> 3460.18]  beef in my life
[3460.18 --> 3460.52]  I just
[3460.52 --> 3461.50]  like it's a waste
[3461.50 --> 3462.40]  of brain energy
[3462.40 --> 3462.84]  for me
[3462.84 --> 3464.44]  but the
[3464.44 --> 3464.98]  the argument
[3464.98 --> 3465.66]  that is often
[3465.66 --> 3466.76]  used to defend
[3466.76 --> 3467.22]  it is
[3467.22 --> 3467.96]  fair use
[3467.96 --> 3470.68]  fair use
[3470.68 --> 3471.68]  is
[3471.68 --> 3473.00]  a grey area
[3473.00 --> 3474.16]  for one thing
[3474.16 --> 3476.06]  it actually has to be
[3476.06 --> 3477.06]  it actually has to be
[3477.06 --> 3478.14]  defended in court
[3478.14 --> 3478.64]  it is
[3478.64 --> 3479.00]  it is
[3479.00 --> 3479.70]  is not
[3479.70 --> 3480.72]  as simple as
[3480.72 --> 3481.66]  well it's fair use
[3481.66 --> 3482.86]  therefore it's fine
[3482.86 --> 3485.42]  the only reason
[3485.42 --> 3486.24]  that you might
[3486.24 --> 3487.34]  get away with saying
[3487.34 --> 3488.54]  it's fair use
[3488.54 --> 3489.12]  is if
[3489.12 --> 3490.18]  nobody chooses
[3490.18 --> 3491.46]  to challenge you on it
[3491.46 --> 3492.70]  so in a way
[3492.70 --> 3493.78]  you could look at
[3493.78 --> 3494.80]  that fair use
[3494.80 --> 3495.98]  argument for react
[3495.98 --> 3496.52]  content
[3496.52 --> 3497.72]  as basically
[3497.72 --> 3498.60]  just a way
[3498.60 --> 3500.14]  that large creators
[3500.14 --> 3501.18]  can
[3501.18 --> 3503.86]  turn their nose up
[3503.86 --> 3504.90]  at small creators
[3504.90 --> 3505.86]  who can't afford
[3505.86 --> 3507.00]  to defend their work
[3507.00 --> 3507.84]  by saying
[3507.84 --> 3508.40]  essentially
[3508.40 --> 3509.66]  because you can't
[3509.66 --> 3510.54]  afford to sue me
[3510.54 --> 3512.14]  it's fair use
[3512.14 --> 3514.62]  that's a pretty
[3514.62 --> 3515.78]  shitty stance
[3515.78 --> 3519.48]  and a lot
[3519.48 --> 3520.04]  of what
[3520.04 --> 3521.40]  gets defended
[3521.40 --> 3522.16]  as fair use
[3522.16 --> 3523.40]  is clearly not
[3523.40 --> 3524.44]  you know
[3524.44 --> 3525.16]  Google has
[3525.16 --> 3526.40]  a support doc
[3526.40 --> 3526.92]  for this
[3526.92 --> 3528.14]  because they run
[3528.14 --> 3528.88]  a little site
[3528.88 --> 3529.30]  you might have
[3529.30 --> 3529.92]  heard of before
[3529.92 --> 3530.88]  called YouTube
[3530.88 --> 3532.54]  and so they have
[3532.54 --> 3532.98]  a lot of
[3532.98 --> 3533.50]  kind of like
[3533.50 --> 3535.16]  legal Q&A
[3535.16 --> 3535.56]  on there
[3535.56 --> 3536.60]  and the four
[3536.60 --> 3537.58]  factors of fair use
[3537.58 --> 3538.42]  are laid out
[3538.42 --> 3538.92]  or pillars
[3538.92 --> 3539.82]  if you want to
[3539.82 --> 3540.28]  call them that
[3540.28 --> 3540.80]  are laid out
[3540.80 --> 3541.32]  pretty clearly
[3541.32 --> 3542.58]  so there's the
[3542.58 --> 3543.36]  purpose and character
[3543.36 --> 3543.94]  of the use
[3543.94 --> 3544.82]  including
[3544.82 --> 3545.76]  whether such use
[3545.76 --> 3546.34]  is commercial
[3546.34 --> 3547.32]  or is for
[3547.32 --> 3548.28]  non-profit
[3548.28 --> 3549.52]  educational purposes
[3549.52 --> 3551.56]  if it's commercial
[3551.56 --> 3552.38]  that's a big
[3552.38 --> 3553.22]  strike against you
[3553.22 --> 3553.72]  and the second
[3553.72 --> 3554.66]  you hit
[3554.66 --> 3555.62]  monetization
[3555.62 --> 3557.42]  or pimp t-shirts
[3557.42 --> 3558.28]  or screwdrivers
[3558.28 --> 3559.02]  or whatever else
[3559.02 --> 3560.34]  that's
[3560.34 --> 3561.38]  that's very
[3561.38 --> 3562.10]  that's very
[3562.10 --> 3562.98]  commercial use
[3562.98 --> 3563.64]  right
[3563.64 --> 3565.76]  courts typically
[3565.76 --> 3566.52]  focus on whether
[3566.52 --> 3567.34]  the use is
[3567.34 --> 3568.16]  transformative
[3568.16 --> 3569.06]  that is whether
[3569.06 --> 3569.76]  it adds
[3569.76 --> 3570.90]  new expression
[3570.90 --> 3571.56]  or meaning
[3571.56 --> 3572.42]  to the original
[3572.42 --> 3573.34]  or whether it
[3573.34 --> 3574.00]  merely copies
[3574.00 --> 3574.74]  from the original
[3574.74 --> 3575.92]  and this is a
[3575.92 --> 3576.30]  spectrum
[3576.30 --> 3576.74]  right
[3576.74 --> 3577.44]  this is not
[3577.44 --> 3578.94]  just black
[3578.94 --> 3579.34]  and white
[3579.34 --> 3580.64]  it adds new
[3580.64 --> 3581.04]  expression
[3581.04 --> 3582.42]  or it doesn't
[3582.42 --> 3582.98]  it's up to the
[3582.98 --> 3583.56]  interpretation
[3583.56 --> 3584.06]  and it's up to
[3584.06 --> 3584.52]  the arguments
[3584.52 --> 3585.16]  that get made
[3585.16 --> 3586.46]  number two
[3586.46 --> 3587.46]  is
[3587.46 --> 3589.76]  the nature
[3589.76 --> 3591.08]  of the copyrighted
[3591.08 --> 3591.40]  work
[3591.40 --> 3591.76]  right
[3591.76 --> 3593.02]  so using material
[3593.02 --> 3594.14]  from a factual
[3594.14 --> 3594.78]  work is more
[3594.78 --> 3595.72]  likely to be fair
[3595.72 --> 3596.72]  than from a
[3596.72 --> 3597.72]  fictional work
[3597.72 --> 3599.10]  number three
[3599.10 --> 3599.86]  the amount
[3599.86 --> 3601.16]  and substantiality
[3601.16 --> 3601.94]  of the portion
[3601.94 --> 3602.88]  used in relation
[3602.88 --> 3603.96]  to the copyrighted
[3603.96 --> 3604.70]  work as a whole
[3604.70 --> 3605.54]  and this is where
[3605.54 --> 3606.72]  a lot of react
[3606.72 --> 3607.86]  content as it is
[3607.86 --> 3608.44]  right now
[3608.44 --> 3610.20]  is in deep
[3610.20 --> 3610.78]  doo-doo
[3610.78 --> 3611.90]  a lot of people
[3611.90 --> 3612.44]  in the chat are
[3612.44 --> 3613.18]  talking about the
[3613.18 --> 3614.02]  h3 ruling
[3614.02 --> 3614.44]  yes
[3614.44 --> 3616.28]  that did go in
[3616.28 --> 3617.00]  favor of ethan
[3617.00 --> 3617.58]  but you've also
[3617.58 --> 3618.84]  got to remember
[3618.84 --> 3619.92]  and understand
[3619.92 --> 3621.62]  that fair use
[3621.62 --> 3622.70]  is something that
[3622.70 --> 3623.60]  is tackled on a
[3623.60 --> 3624.96]  case-by-case basis
[3624.96 --> 3625.70]  by the courts
[3625.70 --> 3627.24]  and in the case
[3627.24 --> 3628.56]  of h3 productions
[3628.56 --> 3629.78]  versus that guy
[3629.78 --> 3631.10]  can't remember his
[3631.10 --> 3631.34]  name
[3631.34 --> 3632.82]  um ethan
[3632.82 --> 3634.00]  to his credit
[3634.00 --> 3635.32]  did not use
[3635.32 --> 3636.32]  the entire
[3636.32 --> 3637.54]  original source
[3637.54 --> 3638.84]  and
[3638.84 --> 3639.84]  the
[3639.84 --> 3643.28]  the uh
[3643.28 --> 3644.06]  the bulk
[3644.06 --> 3644.82]  of the video
[3644.82 --> 3645.58]  was
[3645.58 --> 3646.42]  for better
[3646.42 --> 3647.18]  or for worse
[3647.18 --> 3647.86]  um
[3647.86 --> 3650.24]  h3's commentary
[3650.24 --> 3651.04]  right
[3651.04 --> 3652.08]  as opposed to
[3652.08 --> 3652.90]  just
[3652.90 --> 3653.94]  the original
[3653.94 --> 3654.44]  work
[3654.44 --> 3655.54]  being consumed
[3655.54 --> 3656.26]  in a way
[3656.26 --> 3656.66]  that is
[3656.66 --> 3657.74]  not benefiting
[3657.74 --> 3658.80]  the original rights
[3658.80 --> 3660.04]  holder in any way
[3660.04 --> 3661.46]  number four
[3661.46 --> 3662.48]  and this is another
[3662.48 --> 3663.34]  huge one
[3663.34 --> 3664.12]  that is highly
[3664.12 --> 3664.62]  problematic
[3664.62 --> 3665.42]  with a lot of
[3665.42 --> 3666.04]  react content
[3666.04 --> 3666.52]  right now
[3666.52 --> 3667.74]  the effect
[3667.74 --> 3668.28]  on
[3668.28 --> 3669.34]  the potential
[3669.34 --> 3670.12]  market for
[3670.12 --> 3671.08]  or the value
[3671.08 --> 3671.50]  of
[3671.50 --> 3672.48]  the copyrighted
[3672.48 --> 3672.76]  work
[3672.76 --> 3674.04]  if you play
[3674.04 --> 3674.92]  the entire
[3674.92 --> 3675.92]  video
[3675.92 --> 3676.70]  as part of the
[3676.70 --> 3677.00]  video
[3677.00 --> 3678.52]  the impact
[3678.52 --> 3679.14]  is
[3679.14 --> 3679.96]  enormous
[3679.96 --> 3681.08]  uh
[3681.08 --> 3681.50]  like if
[3681.50 --> 3682.18]  like let's say
[3682.18 --> 3682.74]  for example
[3682.74 --> 3683.64]  someone did a
[3683.64 --> 3684.50]  react video
[3684.50 --> 3685.66]  to one of ours
[3685.66 --> 3686.52]  where they
[3686.52 --> 3687.54]  pulled a few
[3687.54 --> 3688.24]  key things
[3688.24 --> 3689.36]  but largely
[3689.36 --> 3690.60]  transformed it
[3690.60 --> 3692.08]  largely contributed
[3692.08 --> 3693.16]  their own thoughts
[3693.16 --> 3693.88]  and their own
[3693.88 --> 3694.48]  expression
[3694.48 --> 3695.38]  um
[3695.38 --> 3695.92]  that is
[3695.92 --> 3697.66]  pretty obviously
[3697.66 --> 3698.36]  fair use
[3698.36 --> 3699.04]  even though it
[3699.04 --> 3699.76]  is commercial
[3699.76 --> 3700.58]  so usually
[3700.58 --> 3701.20]  I wouldn't
[3701.20 --> 3702.06]  consider our
[3702.06 --> 3703.02]  um
[3703.02 --> 3703.68]  I wouldn't consider
[3703.68 --> 3704.26]  our content
[3704.26 --> 3704.76]  to be
[3704.76 --> 3705.58]  primarily
[3705.58 --> 3706.14]  uh
[3706.14 --> 3707.36]  purely fictional
[3707.36 --> 3708.14]  uh
[3708.14 --> 3708.92]  I'd say that
[3708.92 --> 3709.22]  we
[3709.22 --> 3710.02]  we strive to
[3710.02 --> 3710.46]  create
[3710.46 --> 3711.30]  uh
[3711.30 --> 3712.22]  factual works
[3712.22 --> 3713.06]  so
[3713.06 --> 3714.12]  it is more
[3714.12 --> 3714.72]  likely to be
[3714.72 --> 3715.10]  covered by
[3715.10 --> 3715.62]  fair use
[3715.62 --> 3716.24]  uh
[3716.24 --> 3716.70]  the character
[3716.70 --> 3717.16]  of the use
[3717.16 --> 3717.76]  while it is
[3717.76 --> 3718.38]  commercial
[3718.38 --> 3719.26]  it would be
[3719.26 --> 3720.26]  highly transformative
[3720.26 --> 3721.20]  um
[3721.20 --> 3721.98]  and the amount
[3721.98 --> 3723.42]  of that is used
[3723.42 --> 3724.60]  in relation to the
[3724.60 --> 3725.20]  copyrighted work
[3725.20 --> 3725.64]  as a whole
[3725.64 --> 3727.04]  could be quite low
[3727.04 --> 3728.00]  there also
[3728.00 --> 3729.02]  is potentially
[3729.02 --> 3730.18]  a positive effect
[3730.18 --> 3730.90]  on the potential
[3730.90 --> 3731.72]  market for
[3731.72 --> 3732.52]  the copyrighted
[3732.52 --> 3732.82]  work
[3732.82 --> 3733.76]  um
[3733.76 --> 3734.40]  so in the case
[3734.40 --> 3734.76]  of something
[3734.76 --> 3735.20]  like
[3735.20 --> 3735.90]  let's say
[3735.90 --> 3737.00]  a um
[3737.00 --> 3738.70]  no no let's
[3738.70 --> 3739.06]  stick with the
[3739.06 --> 3739.62]  example that we're
[3739.62 --> 3740.32]  using just for the
[3740.32 --> 3740.74]  sake of
[3740.74 --> 3741.26]  of ease of
[3741.26 --> 3741.86]  following along
[3741.86 --> 3743.28]  so if you only
[3743.28 --> 3744.22]  provide snippets
[3744.22 --> 3744.74]  of the original
[3744.74 --> 3745.14]  video
[3745.14 --> 3745.96]  but
[3745.96 --> 3746.94]  explicitly in your
[3746.94 --> 3747.68]  content you say
[3747.68 --> 3748.38]  but
[3748.38 --> 3749.52]  there's some key
[3749.52 --> 3750.18]  parts of it that
[3750.18 --> 3750.90]  you should go check
[3750.90 --> 3751.54]  out I've got it
[3751.54 --> 3752.32]  linked down below
[3752.32 --> 3753.50]  there's a much
[3753.50 --> 3754.40]  stronger argument
[3754.40 --> 3755.58]  for fair use
[3755.58 --> 3757.02]  as it is right
[3757.02 --> 3757.48]  now
[3757.48 --> 3758.78]  if you upload a
[3758.78 --> 3759.44]  video that is
[3759.44 --> 3759.96]  essentially
[3759.96 --> 3762.06]  the entire
[3762.06 --> 3763.14]  original work
[3763.14 --> 3764.46]  for profit
[3764.46 --> 3765.46]  for yourself
[3765.46 --> 3767.06]  with some chunks
[3767.06 --> 3768.02]  where you
[3768.02 --> 3769.38]  respond to
[3769.38 --> 3770.88]  or react to
[3770.88 --> 3771.98]  or talk over
[3771.98 --> 3773.08]  the original work
[3773.08 --> 3774.16]  there is no
[3774.16 --> 3775.16]  reason whatsoever
[3775.16 --> 3776.26]  to go watch
[3776.26 --> 3777.10]  the original work
[3777.10 --> 3777.66]  and so you'll see
[3777.66 --> 3778.54]  these large creators
[3778.54 --> 3779.18]  that are getting
[3779.18 --> 3780.42]  in some cases
[3780.42 --> 3782.06]  many times
[3782.06 --> 3783.32]  the viewership
[3783.32 --> 3785.04]  of the original
[3785.04 --> 3785.50]  work
[3785.50 --> 3786.78]  at the cost
[3786.78 --> 3787.36]  of the original
[3787.36 --> 3787.74]  work
[3787.74 --> 3789.28]  and I honestly
[3789.28 --> 3790.26]  don't have
[3790.26 --> 3791.12]  I don't have the
[3791.12 --> 3791.74]  solution to this
[3791.74 --> 3792.18]  right now
[3792.18 --> 3793.04]  because like
[3793.04 --> 3793.74]  it's pretty clear
[3793.74 --> 3794.50]  that YouTube's
[3794.50 --> 3795.18]  copyright claim
[3795.18 --> 3796.00]  system is
[3796.00 --> 3796.78]  pretty broken
[3796.78 --> 3798.06]  like even
[3798.06 --> 3799.02]  if something
[3799.02 --> 3799.82]  was clearly
[3799.82 --> 3800.84]  not fair use
[3800.84 --> 3801.94]  you know
[3801.94 --> 3802.34]  A
[3802.34 --> 3803.32]  I don't
[3803.32 --> 3803.76]  necessarily
[3803.76 --> 3804.30]  think that I
[3804.30 --> 3804.54]  would be
[3804.54 --> 3805.16]  entitled to
[3805.16 --> 3806.30]  100%
[3806.30 --> 3807.22]  of the revenue
[3807.22 --> 3808.52]  which to my
[3808.52 --> 3809.36]  knowledge is the
[3809.36 --> 3810.16]  only way you
[3810.16 --> 3810.70]  can copyright
[3810.70 --> 3811.36]  claim something
[3811.36 --> 3812.16]  you basically
[3812.16 --> 3812.68]  just say
[3812.68 --> 3813.98]  I think
[3813.98 --> 3815.20]  that's all
[3815.20 --> 3815.54]  mine
[3815.54 --> 3816.44]  or you can
[3816.44 --> 3817.08]  say I think
[3817.08 --> 3817.50]  I deserve
[3817.50 --> 3817.90]  nothing
[3817.90 --> 3818.98]  there's no
[3818.98 --> 3819.56]  middle ground
[3819.56 --> 3820.18]  whatsoever
[3820.18 --> 3821.44]  and two
[3821.44 --> 3822.42]  the community
[3822.42 --> 3823.36]  backlash is just
[3823.36 --> 3823.98]  not worth it
[3823.98 --> 3824.92]  because there's
[3824.92 --> 3825.64]  this perception
[3825.64 --> 3828.94]  that I don't
[3828.94 --> 3829.84]  I don't know
[3829.84 --> 3830.56]  I actually
[3830.56 --> 3831.02]  I actually
[3831.02 --> 3831.40]  just don't
[3831.40 --> 3832.24]  really understand
[3832.24 --> 3833.06]  why
[3833.06 --> 3835.70]  because sitting
[3835.70 --> 3836.40]  as someone
[3836.40 --> 3837.20]  who is
[3837.20 --> 3838.52]  relatively speaking
[3838.52 --> 3839.76]  on the top
[3839.76 --> 3840.84]  of the online
[3840.84 --> 3841.66]  creator pyramid
[3841.66 --> 3842.88]  I can tell you
[3842.88 --> 3843.52]  right now
[3843.52 --> 3844.46]  that the
[3844.46 --> 3845.58]  community backlash
[3845.58 --> 3846.56]  that follows
[3846.56 --> 3847.82]  any smaller
[3847.82 --> 3848.58]  creator who's
[3848.58 --> 3849.08]  trying to
[3849.08 --> 3849.54]  enforce
[3849.54 --> 3851.46]  copyright
[3851.46 --> 3853.26]  is
[3853.26 --> 3854.62]  wrong
[3854.62 --> 3856.32]  it's wrong
[3856.32 --> 3857.12]  it's just
[3857.12 --> 3857.78]  plain wrong
[3857.78 --> 3859.06]  it benefits
[3859.06 --> 3859.48]  the people
[3859.48 --> 3859.84]  who are at
[3859.84 --> 3860.24]  the top
[3860.24 --> 3860.84]  who don't
[3860.84 --> 3861.32]  need it
[3861.32 --> 3862.68]  they actually
[3862.68 --> 3863.32]  have money
[3863.32 --> 3864.32]  they could
[3864.32 --> 3865.26]  hire staff
[3865.26 --> 3866.42]  create something
[3866.42 --> 3866.88]  original
[3866.88 --> 3868.54]  get equipment
[3868.54 --> 3869.08]  whatever
[3869.08 --> 3870.18]  whereas the
[3870.18 --> 3870.70]  people who are
[3870.70 --> 3871.34]  at the bottom
[3871.34 --> 3872.18]  actually
[3872.18 --> 3873.34]  need it
[3873.34 --> 3875.06]  they can't
[3875.06 --> 3875.62]  build a
[3875.62 --> 3875.86]  screwdriver
[3875.86 --> 3876.56]  from scratch
[3876.56 --> 3876.88]  and sell
[3876.88 --> 3877.88]  100,000 units
[3877.88 --> 3878.64]  right
[3878.64 --> 3879.36]  like they don't
[3879.36 --> 3879.80]  they don't
[3879.80 --> 3880.42]  have the same
[3880.42 --> 3880.84]  tools
[3880.84 --> 3881.86]  and so
[3881.86 --> 3882.38]  to
[3882.38 --> 3884.52]  to
[3884.52 --> 3885.32]  ignore
[3885.32 --> 3888.40]  to ignore
[3888.40 --> 3889.24]  these arguments
[3889.24 --> 3890.06]  just because
[3890.06 --> 3890.68]  you know
[3890.68 --> 3891.56]  we don't like
[3891.56 --> 3891.90]  what
[3891.90 --> 3892.54]  people being
[3892.54 --> 3893.22]  mean to
[3893.22 --> 3893.74]  people we
[3893.74 --> 3894.12]  formed a
[3894.12 --> 3894.56]  parasocial
[3894.56 --> 3895.02]  relationship
[3895.02 --> 3895.42]  with
[3895.42 --> 3896.98]  it's messed
[3896.98 --> 3897.46]  up man
[3897.46 --> 3898.08]  okay
[3898.08 --> 3898.94]  so all of
[3898.94 --> 3899.24]  that being
[3899.24 --> 3899.52]  said
[3899.52 --> 3900.12]  how's yours
[3900.12 --> 3900.56]  gonna work
[3900.56 --> 3901.28]  so
[3901.28 --> 3902.34]  what I've
[3902.34 --> 3902.78]  got in
[3902.78 --> 3903.14]  the
[3903.14 --> 3904.72]  I'm not
[3904.72 --> 3905.16]  signed into
[3905.16 --> 3905.62]  that account
[3905.62 --> 3906.00]  on here
[3906.00 --> 3906.48]  in one sec
[3906.48 --> 3906.88]  good
[3906.88 --> 3907.74]  yes
[3907.74 --> 3908.04]  yes
[3908.04 --> 3908.30]  yes
[3908.30 --> 3908.52]  yes
[3908.52 --> 3908.74]  yes
[3908.74 --> 3908.98]  yes
[3908.98 --> 3909.18]  yes
[3909.18 --> 3911.30]  so
[3911.30 --> 3912.02]  basically
[3912.02 --> 3912.56]  I
[3912.56 --> 3913.26]  oh shoot
[3913.26 --> 3913.50]  it's in
[3913.50 --> 3914.04]  the comments
[3914.04 --> 3916.06]  general
[3916.06 --> 3917.30]  reaction channel
[3917.30 --> 3917.88]  guidelines
[3917.88 --> 3918.30]  timeliness
[3918.30 --> 3918.86]  is hugely
[3918.86 --> 3919.50]  important
[3919.50 --> 3920.12]  blah blah
[3920.12 --> 3920.40]  blah
[3920.40 --> 3920.82]  no
[3920.82 --> 3921.30]  no
[3921.30 --> 3922.00]  where is
[3922.00 --> 3922.92]  it
[3922.92 --> 3923.66]  shoot
[3923.66 --> 3924.40]  okay
[3924.40 --> 3925.24]  that time
[3925.24 --> 3926.06]  someone reacted
[3926.06 --> 3926.64]  to one of
[3926.64 --> 3927.02]  our things
[3927.02 --> 3927.84]  yeah it was
[3927.84 --> 3928.88]  really really
[3928.88 --> 3929.26]  interesting
[3929.26 --> 3929.90]  so again
[3929.90 --> 3930.30]  as a
[3930.30 --> 3930.84]  as a content
[3930.84 --> 3931.22]  creator
[3931.22 --> 3932.20]  I have
[3932.20 --> 3932.80]  you know
[3932.80 --> 3933.72]  actual numbers
[3933.72 --> 3934.54]  for how
[3934.54 --> 3935.14]  beneficial
[3935.14 --> 3936.20]  reaction content
[3936.20 --> 3936.72]  is to
[3936.72 --> 3937.14]  the original
[3937.14 --> 3937.54]  creator
[3937.54 --> 3938.00]  the answer
[3938.00 --> 3938.16]  is
[3938.16 --> 3939.48]  much
[3939.48 --> 3940.70]  in case
[3940.70 --> 3940.96]  you guys
[3940.96 --> 3941.34]  are wondering
[3941.34 --> 3941.74]  and that's
[3941.74 --> 3942.54]  even as
[3942.54 --> 3943.46]  someone
[3943.46 --> 3944.50]  with a
[3944.50 --> 3944.92]  substantial
[3944.92 --> 3945.38]  following
[3945.38 --> 3945.80]  already
[3945.80 --> 3946.52]  and whose
[3946.52 --> 3946.90]  content
[3946.90 --> 3947.58]  might already
[3947.58 --> 3947.92]  have
[3947.92 --> 3948.50]  significant
[3948.50 --> 3948.96]  momentum
[3948.96 --> 3950.24]  on
[3950.24 --> 3950.82]  on a
[3950.82 --> 3951.04]  channel
[3951.04 --> 3951.28]  from
[3951.28 --> 3951.68]  someone
[3951.68 --> 3951.98]  who's
[3951.98 --> 3952.16]  only
[3952.16 --> 3952.36]  ever
[3952.36 --> 3952.68]  upload
[3952.68 --> 3952.86]  or
[3952.86 --> 3953.46]  on a
[3953.46 --> 3953.66]  channel
[3953.66 --> 3953.86]  that's
[3953.86 --> 3954.18]  only ever
[3954.18 --> 3954.52]  uploaded
[3954.52 --> 3955.08]  one video
[3955.08 --> 3955.50]  or something
[3955.50 --> 3955.92]  like that
[3955.92 --> 3956.16]  where they
[3956.16 --> 3956.70]  don't have
[3956.70 --> 3957.08]  that
[3957.08 --> 3957.84]  that
[3957.84 --> 3958.14]  critical
[3958.14 --> 3958.62]  mass
[3958.62 --> 3960.14]  I do
[3960.14 --> 3960.36]  think
[3960.36 --> 3960.60]  there's
[3960.60 --> 3960.88]  multiple
[3960.88 --> 3961.24]  arguments
[3961.24 --> 3961.94]  here
[3961.94 --> 3962.84]  sure
[3962.84 --> 3963.24]  and it
[3963.24 --> 3963.82]  depends
[3963.82 --> 3964.16]  on the
[3964.16 --> 3964.44]  nature
[3964.44 --> 3965.04]  of the
[3965.04 --> 3965.42]  inclusion
[3965.42 --> 3966.04]  yes
[3966.04 --> 3966.42]  if you
[3966.42 --> 3966.90]  include
[3966.90 --> 3967.66]  so this
[3967.66 --> 3967.96]  is
[3967.96 --> 3968.32]  okay
[3968.32 --> 3969.02]  I'm getting
[3969.02 --> 3969.62]  to it
[3969.62 --> 3970.00]  okay
[3970.00 --> 3971.12]  I'm getting
[3971.12 --> 3971.76]  to it
[3971.76 --> 3972.84]  unfortunately
[3972.84 --> 3973.40]  I just
[3973.40 --> 3974.06]  don't have
[3974.06 --> 3974.50]  the
[3974.50 --> 3976.56]  basically
[3976.56 --> 3977.00]  I lay
[3977.00 --> 3977.28]  I don't
[3977.28 --> 3977.42]  know
[3977.42 --> 3977.74]  I can't
[3977.74 --> 3978.04]  find it
[3978.04 --> 3978.30]  I laid
[3978.30 --> 3978.50]  out
[3978.50 --> 3978.60]  I've
[3978.60 --> 3979.02]  seen it
[3979.02 --> 3979.30]  work
[3979.30 --> 3979.82]  I've
[3979.82 --> 3980.08]  laid out
[3980.08 --> 3980.60]  some guidelines
[3980.60 --> 3981.60]  for what
[3981.60 --> 3981.88]  I would
[3981.88 --> 3982.30]  consider
[3982.30 --> 3982.70]  to be
[3982.70 --> 3983.54]  ethical
[3983.54 --> 3984.16]  reaction
[3984.16 --> 3984.70]  content
[3984.70 --> 3985.58]  where
[3985.58 --> 3986.06]  the
[3986.06 --> 3986.52]  goal
[3986.52 --> 3987.02]  the
[3987.02 --> 3987.30]  stated
[3987.30 --> 3987.86]  purpose
[3987.86 --> 3988.36]  and
[3988.36 --> 3988.72]  not
[3988.72 --> 3988.90]  just
[3988.90 --> 3989.08]  the
[3989.08 --> 3989.34]  stated
[3989.34 --> 3989.70]  purpose
[3989.70 --> 3989.94]  but
[3989.94 --> 3990.14]  the
[3990.14 --> 3990.60]  actual
[3990.60 --> 3990.92]  goal
[3990.92 --> 3991.04]  of
[3991.04 --> 3991.16]  the
[3991.16 --> 3991.50]  content
[3991.50 --> 3991.82]  needs
[3991.82 --> 3992.08]  to be
[3992.08 --> 3992.56]  to uplift
[3992.56 --> 3992.80]  the
[3992.80 --> 3993.10]  original
[3993.10 --> 3993.56]  creator
[3993.56 --> 3994.48]  as opposed
[3994.48 --> 3994.94]  to
[3994.94 --> 3995.72]  coming back
[3995.72 --> 3996.10]  to the
[3996.10 --> 3996.34]  pillars
[3996.34 --> 3996.72]  of fair
[3996.72 --> 3997.14]  use
[3997.14 --> 3998.62]  harm
[3998.62 --> 3999.82]  the value
[3999.82 --> 4000.60]  or potential
[4000.60 --> 4001.02]  market
[4001.02 --> 4001.78]  for the
[4001.78 --> 4002.14]  original
[4002.14 --> 4002.54]  work
[4002.54 --> 4003.92]  and I
[4003.92 --> 4004.10]  think
[4004.10 --> 4004.44]  that's
[4004.44 --> 4004.72]  something
[4004.72 --> 4005.32]  that
[4005.32 --> 4006.02]  has just
[4006.02 --> 4006.38]  been
[4006.38 --> 4007.50]  completely
[4007.50 --> 4007.98]  lost
[4007.98 --> 4008.62]  I think
[4008.62 --> 4008.86]  there's
[4008.86 --> 4009.12]  I think
[4009.12 --> 4009.34]  there's
[4009.34 --> 4009.62]  been
[4009.62 --> 4010.84]  I think
[4010.84 --> 4011.32]  there is
[4011.32 --> 4011.60]  and there
[4011.60 --> 4012.14]  has been
[4012.14 --> 4012.52]  reaction
[4012.52 --> 4012.90]  content
[4012.90 --> 4013.30]  that is
[4013.30 --> 4013.54]  like
[4013.54 --> 4014.30]  clearly
[4014.30 --> 4015.10]  exploitative
[4015.10 --> 4016.62]  exploitative
[4016.62 --> 4017.40]  exploitative
[4017.40 --> 4017.76]  yes
[4017.76 --> 4020.46]  he hasn't
[4020.46 --> 4020.98]  been practicing
[4020.98 --> 4021.74]  talking for a
[4021.74 --> 4021.86]  week
[4021.86 --> 4022.32]  it's actually
[4022.32 --> 4022.72]  true
[4022.72 --> 4025.28]  that's
[4025.28 --> 4025.48]  probably
[4025.48 --> 4025.76]  not the
[4025.76 --> 4026.04]  reason why
[4026.04 --> 4026.38]  that just
[4026.38 --> 4026.64]  happened
[4026.64 --> 4027.00]  but it
[4027.00 --> 4027.56]  is true
[4027.56 --> 4029.28]  but I
[4029.28 --> 4029.88]  have also
[4029.88 --> 4030.20]  seen
[4030.20 --> 4030.52]  reaction
[4030.52 --> 4030.92]  content
[4030.92 --> 4031.92]  that has
[4031.92 --> 4032.52]  like made
[4032.52 --> 4033.10]  channels
[4033.10 --> 4033.72]  basically
[4033.72 --> 4034.20]  for sure
[4034.20 --> 4035.40]  for sure
[4035.40 --> 4035.94]  it totally
[4035.94 --> 4036.36]  happens
[4036.36 --> 4036.96]  and I
[4036.96 --> 4037.40]  think a lot
[4037.40 --> 4037.56]  of it
[4037.56 --> 4037.78]  we were
[4037.78 --> 4038.16]  talking about
[4038.16 --> 4038.54]  earlier
[4038.54 --> 4038.94]  but like
[4038.94 --> 4039.16]  how
[4039.16 --> 4039.76]  instead of
[4039.76 --> 4040.20]  the algorithm
[4040.20 --> 4040.50]  you should
[4040.50 --> 4040.66]  say
[4040.66 --> 4041.08]  community
[4041.08 --> 4041.64]  I think
[4041.64 --> 4041.86]  a lot
[4041.86 --> 4042.02]  of it
[4042.02 --> 4042.28]  has to
[4042.28 --> 4042.36]  do
[4042.36 --> 4042.46]  with
[4042.46 --> 4042.56]  the
[4042.56 --> 4042.80]  community
[4042.80 --> 4043.00]  that
[4043.00 --> 4043.28]  follows
[4043.28 --> 4043.50]  that
[4043.50 --> 4043.92]  person
[4043.92 --> 4044.48]  are they
[4044.48 --> 4045.22]  only ever
[4045.22 --> 4045.98]  going to
[4045.98 --> 4046.90]  watch this
[4046.90 --> 4047.36]  person's
[4047.36 --> 4047.82]  content
[4047.82 --> 4048.98]  because of
[4048.98 --> 4049.50]  the host
[4049.50 --> 4049.96]  and they have
[4049.96 --> 4050.58]  no real
[4050.58 --> 4051.12]  cares about
[4051.12 --> 4051.62]  the source
[4051.62 --> 4053.14]  and they're
[4053.14 --> 4053.58]  never going to
[4053.58 --> 4054.04]  follow through
[4054.04 --> 4054.40]  they're never
[4054.40 --> 4055.00]  going to go
[4055.00 --> 4055.28]  to that
[4055.28 --> 4055.58]  channel
[4055.58 --> 4055.88]  they're never
[4055.88 --> 4056.06]  going to
[4056.06 --> 4056.32]  check it
[4056.32 --> 4056.42]  out
[4056.42 --> 4056.68]  whatever
[4056.68 --> 4057.82]  or is it
[4057.82 --> 4058.24]  a community
[4058.24 --> 4058.74]  of people
[4058.74 --> 4059.42]  that are
[4059.42 --> 4059.64]  going to
[4059.64 --> 4060.04]  follow through
[4060.04 --> 4060.32]  and are
[4060.32 --> 4060.50]  going to
[4060.50 --> 4061.08]  give support
[4061.08 --> 4062.28]  when the
[4062.28 --> 4062.70]  creator
[4062.70 --> 4063.06]  watches
[4063.06 --> 4063.62]  different videos
[4063.62 --> 4063.96]  whatever
[4063.96 --> 4064.48]  the problem
[4064.48 --> 4064.76]  with that
[4064.76 --> 4065.02]  argument
[4065.02 --> 4065.40]  is it's
[4065.40 --> 4065.66]  not up
[4065.66 --> 4065.94]  to you
[4065.94 --> 4066.84]  yeah
[4066.84 --> 4067.30]  it's up
[4067.30 --> 4067.50]  to the
[4067.50 --> 4067.74]  original
[4067.74 --> 4068.16]  copyright
[4068.16 --> 4068.48]  holder
[4068.48 --> 4069.48]  well for
[4069.48 --> 4069.74]  sure
[4069.74 --> 4070.02]  yeah
[4070.02 --> 4070.86]  so it
[4070.86 --> 4071.10]  doesn't
[4071.10 --> 4071.36]  matter
[4071.36 --> 4071.66]  what you
[4071.66 --> 4071.86]  think
[4071.86 --> 4072.20]  no I
[4072.20 --> 4072.50]  well
[4072.50 --> 4074.10]  that's not
[4074.10 --> 4074.34]  a good
[4074.34 --> 4074.68]  take
[4074.68 --> 4075.22]  well it
[4075.22 --> 4075.60]  doesn't
[4075.60 --> 4075.84]  though
[4075.84 --> 4076.30]  well it
[4076.30 --> 4076.62]  doesn't
[4076.62 --> 4076.78]  matter
[4076.78 --> 4077.10]  that's not
[4077.10 --> 4077.66]  my statement
[4077.66 --> 4078.84]  oh I
[4078.84 --> 4079.10]  thought you
[4079.10 --> 4079.54]  were saying
[4079.54 --> 4080.38]  that I
[4080.38 --> 4080.78]  as the
[4080.78 --> 4081.32]  reactor
[4081.32 --> 4081.72]  no
[4081.72 --> 4082.28]  can just
[4082.28 --> 4082.82]  decide
[4082.82 --> 4083.16]  well
[4083.16 --> 4083.92]  no my
[4083.92 --> 4084.24]  audience
[4084.24 --> 4084.76]  isn't really
[4084.76 --> 4085.02]  going to
[4085.02 --> 4085.42]  follow through
[4085.42 --> 4085.76]  on this
[4085.76 --> 4086.06]  so I
[4086.06 --> 4086.46]  should just
[4086.46 --> 4086.80]  show it
[4086.80 --> 4087.06]  to them
[4087.06 --> 4087.26]  no
[4087.26 --> 4087.74]  oh okay
[4087.74 --> 4088.14]  I misunderstood
[4088.14 --> 4088.50]  you
[4088.50 --> 4089.18]  because I
[4089.18 --> 4089.46]  was like
[4089.46 --> 4090.04]  really
[4090.04 --> 4090.68]  what I'm
[4090.68 --> 4091.20]  saying is
[4091.20 --> 4091.74]  that in
[4091.74 --> 4093.10]  in I
[4093.10 --> 4093.62]  think especially
[4093.62 --> 4094.20]  the current
[4094.20 --> 4094.70]  era there's
[4094.70 --> 4095.42]  a big mix
[4095.42 --> 4096.32]  of ones that
[4096.32 --> 4096.88]  are good
[4096.88 --> 4097.30]  and aren't
[4097.30 --> 4097.66]  good and
[4097.66 --> 4098.06]  obviously
[4098.06 --> 4099.10]  even within
[4099.10 --> 4099.96]  individuals
[4099.96 --> 4101.20]  there's a mix
[4101.20 --> 4102.20]  of doing
[4102.20 --> 4102.58]  the right
[4102.58 --> 4103.24]  thing and
[4103.24 --> 4103.92]  being extremely
[4103.92 --> 4104.26]  lazy
[4104.26 --> 4104.82]  I've seen
[4104.82 --> 4105.72]  example clips
[4105.72 --> 4106.32]  of someone
[4106.32 --> 4107.40]  who will
[4107.40 --> 4108.12]  go from
[4108.12 --> 4109.52]  really good
[4109.52 --> 4110.96]  reactionary
[4110.96 --> 4112.00]  content to
[4112.00 --> 4112.40]  a piece
[4112.40 --> 4112.92]  of content
[4112.92 --> 4113.50]  that probably
[4113.50 --> 4114.46]  wants you
[4114.46 --> 4115.06]  to that
[4115.06 --> 4115.54]  probably makes
[4115.54 --> 4116.22]  you want
[4116.22 --> 4116.52]  to go
[4116.52 --> 4117.06]  follow through
[4117.06 --> 4117.38]  and see
[4117.38 --> 4117.76]  the original
[4117.76 --> 4118.00]  creator
[4118.00 --> 4118.20]  all that
[4118.20 --> 4118.34]  kind of
[4118.34 --> 4118.48]  stuff
[4118.48 --> 4118.96]  and then
[4118.96 --> 4119.36]  the next
[4119.36 --> 4119.70]  clip
[4119.70 --> 4120.18]  they're
[4120.18 --> 4120.46]  like
[4120.46 --> 4120.98]  eating
[4120.98 --> 4122.62]  so it
[4122.62 --> 4123.02]  just plays
[4123.02 --> 4123.38]  the video
[4123.38 --> 4123.62]  and they
[4123.62 --> 4123.92]  literally
[4123.92 --> 4124.44]  never say
[4124.44 --> 4124.66]  a whole
[4124.66 --> 4124.86]  thing
[4124.86 --> 4125.08]  and they're
[4125.08 --> 4125.38]  just like
[4125.38 --> 4125.68]  hmm
[4125.68 --> 4127.00]  while they're
[4127.00 --> 4127.24]  chewing
[4127.24 --> 4127.62]  and it's
[4127.62 --> 4128.08]  like wow
[4128.08 --> 4128.64]  alright
[4128.64 --> 4129.18]  well
[4129.18 --> 4131.94]  I don't
[4131.94 --> 4132.28]  really know
[4132.28 --> 4132.82]  what to say
[4132.82 --> 4133.58]  about this
[4133.58 --> 4133.94]  but
[4133.94 --> 4134.32]  well I know
[4134.32 --> 4134.72]  what to say
[4134.72 --> 4136.36]  but they
[4136.36 --> 4136.76]  might watch
[4136.76 --> 4137.40]  LTT and I'm
[4137.40 --> 4137.76]  not supposed
[4137.76 --> 4138.16]  to insult
[4138.16 --> 4138.66]  the audience
[4138.66 --> 4140.34]  got them
[4140.34 --> 4142.06]  but yeah
[4142.06 --> 4142.36]  I don't
[4142.36 --> 4142.56]  know
[4142.56 --> 4143.94]  I know
[4143.94 --> 4144.72]  of channels
[4144.72 --> 4145.56]  that exist
[4145.56 --> 4146.44]  that basically
[4146.44 --> 4147.44]  only exist
[4147.44 --> 4148.26]  because reaction
[4148.26 --> 4148.84]  channels blew
[4148.84 --> 4149.22]  them up
[4149.22 --> 4150.58]  but then I
[4150.58 --> 4151.24]  also know of
[4151.24 --> 4151.84]  channels that
[4151.84 --> 4152.28]  hate it
[4152.28 --> 4153.40]  and have openly
[4153.40 --> 4153.96]  tried to get
[4153.96 --> 4154.62]  people to stop
[4154.62 --> 4155.08]  and people just
[4155.08 --> 4155.82]  keep doing it
[4155.82 --> 4156.70]  and it's like
[4156.70 --> 4157.34]  okay well
[4157.34 --> 4160.16]  it's rough
[4160.16 --> 4161.52]  well the answer
[4161.52 --> 4162.40]  is really simple
[4162.40 --> 4164.06]  the answer is
[4164.06 --> 4165.76]  reach out and ask
[4165.76 --> 4167.14]  and that's
[4167.14 --> 4167.92]  you also know
[4167.92 --> 4168.68]  people that do
[4168.68 --> 4169.16]  that right
[4169.16 --> 4169.50]  now
[4169.50 --> 4170.48]  and that's
[4170.48 --> 4171.30]  the worst
[4171.30 --> 4171.70]  part
[4171.70 --> 4173.44]  like I
[4173.44 --> 4174.08]  have
[4174.08 --> 4174.90]  personally
[4174.90 --> 4176.42]  had content
[4176.42 --> 4177.16]  used
[4177.16 --> 4177.76]  in
[4177.76 --> 4178.64]  montages
[4178.64 --> 4179.22]  or
[4179.22 --> 4180.00]  or
[4180.00 --> 4180.46]  or
[4180.46 --> 4180.94]  or
[4180.94 --> 4181.80]  like
[4181.80 --> 4182.56]  mashups
[4182.56 --> 4183.40]  or reaction
[4183.40 --> 4183.92]  videos
[4183.92 --> 4184.78]  or whatever
[4184.78 --> 4185.44]  yeah
[4185.44 --> 4186.02]  like someone
[4186.02 --> 4186.38]  brought up
[4186.38 --> 4186.84]  in floatplane
[4186.84 --> 4187.10]  chat
[4187.10 --> 4188.46]  Gardner Bryant
[4188.46 --> 4189.78]  was a
[4189.78 --> 4190.90]  Linux creator
[4190.90 --> 4191.80]  that reacted
[4191.80 --> 4192.28]  to some of our
[4192.28 --> 4192.98]  Linux challenge
[4192.98 --> 4193.42]  videos
[4193.42 --> 4194.32]  I watched them
[4194.32 --> 4194.72]  I thought they were
[4194.72 --> 4195.04]  really good
[4195.04 --> 4195.50]  yep
[4195.50 --> 4195.76]  yeah
[4195.76 --> 4197.18]  but hold on
[4197.18 --> 4198.00]  okay I'll get to
[4198.00 --> 4198.62]  that in a second
[4198.62 --> 4200.00]  but I have
[4200.00 --> 4201.14]  I have personally
[4201.14 --> 4202.20]  known of
[4202.20 --> 4203.94]  huge creators
[4203.94 --> 4204.92]  like enormous
[4204.92 --> 4205.42]  creators
[4205.42 --> 4207.84]  that did not
[4207.84 --> 4210.04]  did not have a
[4210.04 --> 4210.78]  valid fair use
[4210.78 --> 4211.64]  argument for their
[4211.64 --> 4212.46]  use of our content
[4212.46 --> 4212.88]  gotcha
[4212.88 --> 4215.82]  and could have
[4215.82 --> 4216.36]  reached out
[4216.36 --> 4217.92]  like it like
[4217.92 --> 4219.10]  like absolutely
[4219.10 --> 4219.78]  could have reached
[4219.78 --> 4220.70]  out or had
[4220.70 --> 4221.66]  their staff
[4221.66 --> 4222.30]  reach out
[4222.30 --> 4222.98]  like I'm talking
[4222.98 --> 4223.90]  creators with a
[4223.90 --> 4224.24]  staff
[4224.24 --> 4225.98]  you know
[4225.98 --> 4227.40]  like Star Wars
[4227.40 --> 4227.62]  kid
[4227.62 --> 4231.78]  that's an old
[4231.78 --> 4232.54]  reference anyway
[4232.54 --> 4234.24]  I just didn't
[4234.24 --> 4235.48]  and that's just
[4235.48 --> 4236.10]  that's just pure
[4236.10 --> 4236.56]  laziness
[4236.56 --> 4237.02]  yeah
[4237.02 --> 4238.08]  even people
[4238.08 --> 4239.10]  even people I know
[4239.10 --> 4239.50]  so there's
[4239.50 --> 4240.22]  there's a handful
[4240.22 --> 4240.90]  of creators
[4240.90 --> 4241.58]  that I have like
[4241.58 --> 4242.08]  a standing
[4242.08 --> 4242.76]  agreement with
[4242.76 --> 4244.28]  like Austin
[4244.28 --> 4245.14]  Marquez for
[4245.14 --> 4245.58]  example
[4245.58 --> 4246.36]  it's like
[4246.36 --> 4246.78]  hey
[4246.78 --> 4249.04]  can we just
[4249.04 --> 4249.58]  have a mutual
[4249.58 --> 4250.36]  like if I need
[4250.36 --> 4250.84]  to use a clip
[4250.84 --> 4251.28]  from you
[4251.28 --> 4251.92]  and I'm like
[4251.92 --> 4252.58]  sure I'd like
[4252.58 --> 4253.44]  say it's from
[4253.44 --> 4253.60]  you
[4253.60 --> 4255.06]  and if you
[4255.06 --> 4255.52]  use a clip
[4255.52 --> 4255.94]  from me
[4255.94 --> 4256.40]  and make sure
[4256.40 --> 4256.76]  that you do
[4256.76 --> 4257.26]  the same
[4257.26 --> 4257.86]  can we just
[4257.86 --> 4258.74]  like not
[4258.74 --> 4259.26]  email every
[4259.26 --> 4259.58]  time
[4259.58 --> 4260.54]  sure
[4260.54 --> 4263.64]  but that's
[4263.64 --> 4264.40]  that's a
[4264.40 --> 4264.82]  positive
[4264.82 --> 4265.30]  that's a
[4265.30 --> 4265.96]  constructive
[4265.96 --> 4266.66]  way to
[4266.66 --> 4267.44]  build community
[4267.44 --> 4268.92]  just taking
[4268.92 --> 4269.38]  stuff
[4269.38 --> 4270.44]  and being like
[4270.44 --> 4271.40]  it'll probably
[4271.40 --> 4271.94]  benefit them
[4271.94 --> 4272.18]  I don't know
[4272.18 --> 4272.34]  maybe
[4272.34 --> 4273.86]  that's not
[4273.86 --> 4274.06]  cool
[4274.06 --> 4275.28]  and it should
[4275.28 --> 4275.74]  never be
[4275.74 --> 4276.18]  acceptable
[4276.18 --> 4277.12]  and you
[4277.12 --> 4277.34]  know you
[4277.34 --> 4277.74]  have to ask
[4277.74 --> 4278.10]  yourself
[4278.10 --> 4278.42]  one of the
[4278.42 --> 4279.12]  pillars of your
[4279.12 --> 4279.74]  reaction channel
[4279.74 --> 4280.22]  are going to be
[4280.22 --> 4280.92]  that you reach out
[4280.92 --> 4281.42]  every time
[4281.42 --> 4282.00]  for every video
[4282.00 --> 4283.04]  I think we should
[4283.04 --> 4283.32]  yeah
[4283.32 --> 4285.26]  I think that
[4285.26 --> 4285.82]  you're speaking out
[4285.82 --> 4286.22]  against it
[4286.22 --> 4286.58]  so I think it
[4286.58 --> 4287.12]  would have to be
[4287.12 --> 4287.30]  right
[4287.30 --> 4288.28]  well it depends
[4288.28 --> 4288.62]  right
[4288.62 --> 4289.74]  so if you are
[4289.74 --> 4290.56]  reacting to
[4290.56 --> 4290.86]  okay
[4290.86 --> 4291.92]  so a perfect
[4291.92 --> 4292.76]  example of this
[4292.76 --> 4293.24]  would be the
[4293.24 --> 4294.72]  recent Coffeezilla
[4294.72 --> 4295.92]  Logan Paul
[4295.92 --> 4296.48]  controversy
[4296.48 --> 4297.50]  Logan Paul's
[4297.50 --> 4298.04]  not going to
[4298.04 --> 4298.82]  give Coffeezilla
[4298.82 --> 4299.42]  permission
[4299.42 --> 4301.28]  to utilize
[4301.28 --> 4302.06]  portions of his
[4302.06 --> 4302.36]  video
[4302.36 --> 4304.44]  but in that
[4304.44 --> 4304.90]  case
[4304.90 --> 4305.92]  Coffeezilla
[4305.92 --> 4307.40]  is clearly
[4307.40 --> 4308.96]  transforming
[4308.96 --> 4309.74]  the original
[4309.74 --> 4310.14]  work
[4310.14 --> 4311.50]  that is not
[4311.50 --> 4312.28]  sitting and
[4312.28 --> 4312.72]  eating
[4312.72 --> 4314.02]  while the
[4314.02 --> 4314.48]  Logan Paul
[4314.48 --> 4315.30]  video plays
[4315.30 --> 4316.84]  as like a
[4316.84 --> 4317.68]  weird spectacle
[4317.68 --> 4318.32]  or whatever
[4318.32 --> 4318.68]  else
[4318.68 --> 4320.36]  so in the
[4320.36 --> 4321.16]  case of
[4321.16 --> 4322.22]  a clear
[4322.22 --> 4322.88]  and obvious
[4322.88 --> 4323.58]  fair use
[4323.58 --> 4324.40]  argument
[4324.40 --> 4325.66]  I don't think
[4325.66 --> 4326.24]  we have to
[4326.24 --> 4329.18]  so we just
[4329.18 --> 4329.54]  have to
[4329.54 --> 4330.70]  sorry
[4330.70 --> 4332.00]  is that
[4332.00 --> 4332.64]  reaction channel
[4332.64 --> 4333.52]  going to
[4333.52 --> 4334.74]  cover divisive
[4334.74 --> 4335.16]  things like
[4335.16 --> 4335.40]  that
[4335.40 --> 4337.16]  I don't know
[4337.16 --> 4338.30]  we're not
[4338.30 --> 4338.78]  sure yet
[4338.78 --> 4339.18]  what is it
[4339.18 --> 4339.70]  is it a
[4339.70 --> 4340.40]  tech reaction
[4340.40 --> 4340.88]  channel
[4340.88 --> 4341.46]  is it
[4341.46 --> 4342.98]  so let's
[4342.98 --> 4343.18]  go
[4343.18 --> 4344.22]  let's talk
[4344.22 --> 4344.66]  about some
[4344.66 --> 4345.00]  of the things
[4345.00 --> 4345.76]  we have in
[4345.76 --> 4345.96]  here
[4345.96 --> 4348.58]  so you know
[4348.58 --> 4349.02]  one of the
[4349.02 --> 4349.56]  things we could
[4349.56 --> 4350.20]  do is like
[4350.20 --> 4350.66]  we've done a
[4350.66 --> 4351.02]  few of these
[4351.02 --> 4351.42]  on the main
[4351.42 --> 4351.94]  channel like
[4351.94 --> 4352.58]  reacting to
[4352.58 --> 4352.96]  community
[4352.96 --> 4353.40]  submissions
[4353.40 --> 4354.34]  like best
[4354.34 --> 4354.72]  and worst
[4354.72 --> 4355.26]  builds and
[4355.26 --> 4355.64]  stuff like
[4355.64 --> 4356.40]  that
[4356.40 --> 4358.34]  reacting to
[4358.34 --> 4359.16]  submissions
[4359.16 --> 4359.52]  it's a
[4359.52 --> 4359.94]  totally different
[4359.94 --> 4360.18]  thing
[4360.18 --> 4360.70]  but it's
[4360.70 --> 4360.84]  still
[4360.84 --> 4361.10]  it's
[4361.10 --> 4361.36]  it's
[4361.36 --> 4361.64]  reaction
[4361.64 --> 4362.00]  content
[4362.00 --> 4362.34]  but it's
[4362.34 --> 4362.58]  not
[4362.58 --> 4362.90]  it's
[4362.90 --> 4363.36]  ethical
[4363.36 --> 4363.86]  reaction
[4363.86 --> 4364.30]  content
[4364.30 --> 4365.52]  in the way
[4365.52 --> 4365.80]  that the
[4365.80 --> 4366.04]  internet
[4366.04 --> 4366.34]  would
[4366.34 --> 4366.74]  would
[4366.74 --> 4367.14]  interpret
[4367.14 --> 4367.60]  the term
[4367.60 --> 4367.98]  reaction
[4367.98 --> 4368.42]  content
[4368.42 --> 4369.44]  really
[4369.44 --> 4369.86]  internet
[4369.86 --> 4370.84]  would you
[4370.84 --> 4371.48]  consider that
[4371.48 --> 4371.72]  to be
[4371.72 --> 4372.26]  reaction
[4372.26 --> 4372.76]  content
[4372.76 --> 4373.28]  I don't
[4373.28 --> 4373.56]  think they
[4373.56 --> 4373.80]  would
[4373.80 --> 4374.50]  because if
[4374.50 --> 4374.82]  you say
[4374.82 --> 4375.12]  react
[4375.12 --> 4375.68]  let's pull it
[4375.68 --> 4376.34]  okay
[4376.34 --> 4377.14]  let's pull it
[4377.14 --> 4378.92]  I'm gonna do
[4378.92 --> 4379.74]  my pull dance
[4379.74 --> 4383.34]  oh my god
[4383.34 --> 4385.52]  you're gonna get
[4385.52 --> 4386.14]  some reaction
[4386.14 --> 4387.40]  content from that
[4387.40 --> 4388.10]  they're gonna side
[4388.10 --> 4388.60]  with you
[4388.60 --> 4389.54]  they're gonna side
[4389.54 --> 4389.84]  with you
[4389.84 --> 4390.50]  even if I'm
[4390.50 --> 4390.68]  right
[4390.68 --> 4391.12]  because you're
[4391.12 --> 4391.56]  wrong
[4391.56 --> 4392.18]  no
[4392.18 --> 4393.76]  it's reaction
[4393.76 --> 4394.38]  content
[4394.38 --> 4396.02]  anyway
[4396.02 --> 4397.38]  it is reaction
[4397.38 --> 4398.00]  content by
[4398.00 --> 4398.74]  definition of the
[4398.74 --> 4399.08]  term
[4399.08 --> 4399.50]  it is not
[4399.50 --> 4400.30]  reaction content
[4400.30 --> 4401.26]  by how the
[4401.26 --> 4402.20]  internet interprets
[4402.20 --> 4402.46]  that
[4402.46 --> 4403.22]  if you say
[4403.22 --> 4404.12]  but you ask
[4404.12 --> 4405.22]  react channel
[4405.22 --> 4405.58]  yeah
[4405.58 --> 4406.34]  people are going
[4406.34 --> 4406.84]  to think that
[4406.84 --> 4407.32]  you're reacting
[4407.32 --> 4407.88]  to videos
[4407.88 --> 4408.64]  because that's
[4408.64 --> 4409.72]  how that works
[4409.72 --> 4410.32]  right now
[4410.32 --> 4411.02]  if it's
[4411.02 --> 4412.06]  user submitted
[4412.06 --> 4412.88]  videos that is
[4412.88 --> 4413.42]  seen as a
[4413.42 --> 4414.18]  different thing
[4414.18 --> 4415.44]  all right
[4415.44 --> 4416.12]  let's see the
[4416.12 --> 4416.60]  poll results
[4416.60 --> 4417.04]  I'm working
[4417.04 --> 4417.44]  I'm working
[4417.44 --> 4419.00]  if you're so
[4419.00 --> 4419.44]  confident
[4419.44 --> 4419.84]  why don't you
[4419.84 --> 4420.26]  put up a
[4420.26 --> 4420.72]  poll smart
[4420.72 --> 4421.34]  because I'm
[4421.34 --> 4422.34]  typing it out
[4422.34 --> 4423.24]  come on
[4423.24 --> 4423.86]  okay so
[4423.86 --> 4424.74]  some other
[4424.74 --> 4425.30]  ideas
[4425.30 --> 4425.84]  you know
[4425.84 --> 4426.76]  I really love
[4426.76 --> 4427.52]  what Corridor
[4427.52 --> 4428.06]  Crew does
[4428.06 --> 4429.30]  where they will
[4429.30 --> 4429.96]  bring on
[4429.96 --> 4430.62]  experts
[4430.62 --> 4431.92]  to react
[4431.92 --> 4432.40]  to
[4432.40 --> 4433.58]  you know
[4433.58 --> 4434.32]  so that's
[4434.32 --> 4434.60]  actually
[4434.60 --> 4435.18]  that's
[4435.18 --> 4436.02]  such a good
[4436.02 --> 4436.48]  example
[4436.48 --> 4437.44]  of how you
[4437.44 --> 4438.00]  can take
[4438.00 --> 4439.40]  very obviously
[4439.40 --> 4440.56]  copyrighted work
[4440.56 --> 4441.76]  from very
[4441.76 --> 4445.00]  aggressive IP
[4445.00 --> 4445.66]  companies
[4445.66 --> 4446.72]  like a Disney
[4446.72 --> 4447.38]  for example
[4447.38 --> 4448.98]  and confidently
[4448.98 --> 4451.04]  include stills
[4451.04 --> 4452.12]  or even motion
[4452.12 --> 4452.72]  from their
[4452.72 --> 4453.16]  content
[4453.16 --> 4454.52]  in your video
[4454.52 --> 4456.12]  because if you
[4456.12 --> 4457.14]  are for example
[4457.14 --> 4458.40]  doing a detailed
[4458.40 --> 4459.00]  breakdown
[4459.00 --> 4460.94]  of how the CGI
[4460.94 --> 4461.66]  was done
[4461.66 --> 4462.36]  for a particular
[4462.36 --> 4463.00]  scene
[4463.00 --> 4463.82]  you're sitting
[4463.82 --> 4464.20]  there you're
[4464.20 --> 4464.88]  talking about
[4464.88 --> 4465.98]  how much work
[4465.98 --> 4466.30]  it was
[4466.30 --> 4466.86]  and how cool
[4466.86 --> 4467.40]  it was
[4467.40 --> 4468.70]  you are not
[4468.70 --> 4469.48]  using a substantial
[4469.48 --> 4469.92]  amount
[4469.92 --> 4471.14]  the effect
[4471.14 --> 4471.76]  on the
[4471.76 --> 4472.62]  original work
[4472.62 --> 4473.52]  is obviously
[4473.52 --> 4474.40]  positive
[4474.40 --> 4476.20]  the nature
[4476.20 --> 4476.92]  of your
[4476.92 --> 4477.92]  own work
[4477.92 --> 4478.80]  is clearly
[4478.80 --> 4479.92]  more
[4479.92 --> 4480.72]  informative
[4480.72 --> 4481.64]  and or
[4481.64 --> 4482.54]  educational
[4482.54 --> 4483.82]  slash factual
[4483.82 --> 4484.92]  and even though
[4484.92 --> 4485.38]  the nature
[4485.38 --> 4486.16]  of the copyrighted
[4486.16 --> 4486.88]  work is
[4486.88 --> 4487.90]  purely fictional
[4487.90 --> 4488.98]  the way it is
[4488.98 --> 4489.92]  being transformed
[4489.92 --> 4491.10]  into something
[4491.10 --> 4491.56]  that is
[4491.56 --> 4492.44]  educational
[4492.44 --> 4493.04]  is
[4493.04 --> 4494.28]  very
[4494.28 --> 4495.00]  very cut
[4495.00 --> 4495.40]  and dried
[4495.40 --> 4496.20]  right
[4496.20 --> 4497.82]  so anyway
[4497.82 --> 4498.68]  bringing in
[4498.68 --> 4499.08]  experts
[4499.08 --> 4500.08]  something
[4500.08 --> 4500.42]  that I've
[4500.42 --> 4500.84]  wanted to do
[4500.84 --> 4501.54]  for a long
[4501.54 --> 4502.04]  time on the
[4502.04 --> 4502.58]  LTT channel
[4502.58 --> 4503.06]  we just haven't
[4503.06 --> 4503.54]  gotten around
[4503.54 --> 4503.84]  to it
[4503.84 --> 4504.08]  might have
[4504.08 --> 4504.46]  even gotten
[4504.46 --> 4504.98]  as far as
[4504.98 --> 4505.36]  an email
[4505.36 --> 4505.88]  to Wendell
[4505.88 --> 4506.56]  sup Wendell
[4506.56 --> 4508.74]  is I want
[4508.74 --> 4509.24]  to do
[4509.24 --> 4510.38]  LTT reacts
[4510.38 --> 4511.00]  to like
[4511.00 --> 4511.92]  bad hacking
[4511.92 --> 4512.40]  scenes in
[4512.40 --> 4512.74]  movies
[4512.74 --> 4515.14]  that would be
[4515.14 --> 4515.44]  amazing
[4515.44 --> 4516.22]  is that react
[4516.22 --> 4517.74]  enough for you
[4517.74 --> 4520.02]  that fits
[4520.02 --> 4520.72]  my term
[4520.72 --> 4521.84]  right
[4521.84 --> 4522.32]  that's what
[4522.32 --> 4522.74]  I'm saying
[4522.74 --> 4523.06]  is that
[4523.06 --> 4523.72]  so yes
[4523.72 --> 4524.04]  okay
[4524.04 --> 4524.38]  is that
[4524.38 --> 4524.84]  acceptable
[4524.84 --> 4526.10]  maybe not
[4526.10 --> 4526.34]  is that
[4526.34 --> 4526.66]  under the
[4526.66 --> 4526.94]  umbrella
[4526.94 --> 4527.80]  of reaction
[4527.80 --> 4528.22]  content
[4528.22 --> 4528.60]  I don't
[4528.60 --> 4528.86]  know if
[4528.86 --> 4529.30]  it is
[4529.30 --> 4530.48]  okay
[4530.48 --> 4531.68]  uh
[4531.68 --> 4532.54]  what is
[4532.54 --> 4532.86]  common
[4532.86 --> 4533.38]  oh your
[4533.38 --> 4533.80]  poll is
[4533.80 --> 4534.18]  bad
[4534.18 --> 4534.54]  because it
[4534.54 --> 4534.86]  makes it
[4534.86 --> 4535.16]  seem like
[4535.16 --> 4535.56]  a binary
[4535.56 --> 4536.10]  choice
[4536.10 --> 4537.40]  because I
[4537.40 --> 4537.80]  didn't include
[4537.80 --> 4538.18]  a both
[4538.18 --> 4538.80]  oh yeah
[4538.80 --> 4539.68]  floatplane chat
[4539.68 --> 4540.60]  does not like
[4540.60 --> 4540.84]  it
[4540.84 --> 4541.20]  yeah because
[4541.20 --> 4541.50]  they want
[4541.50 --> 4541.94]  a both
[4541.94 --> 4543.02]  okay
[4543.02 --> 4544.16]  but that's
[4544.16 --> 4544.88]  complete
[4544.88 --> 4545.68]  that defeats
[4545.68 --> 4546.10]  the whole
[4546.10 --> 4546.54]  point
[4546.54 --> 4547.08]  all right
[4547.08 --> 4547.72]  um
[4547.72 --> 4548.08]  and they
[4548.08 --> 4548.42]  don't get
[4548.42 --> 4548.74]  that and
[4548.74 --> 4549.00]  you don't
[4549.00 --> 4549.34]  get that
[4549.34 --> 4549.58]  but it
[4549.58 --> 4549.90]  defeats
[4549.90 --> 4550.24]  the whole
[4550.24 --> 4550.58]  point
[4550.58 --> 4551.26]  uh
[4551.26 --> 4551.52]  we want
[4551.52 --> 4551.76]  to do
[4551.76 --> 4552.24]  reacting
[4552.24 --> 4552.90]  to like
[4552.90 --> 4553.44]  bad product
[4553.44 --> 4553.82]  listings
[4553.82 --> 4554.46]  so like
[4554.46 --> 4555.16]  going through
[4555.16 --> 4556.04]  like uh
[4556.04 --> 4556.22]  you know
[4556.22 --> 4556.50]  facebook
[4556.50 --> 4557.02]  marketplace
[4557.02 --> 4557.72]  you know
[4557.72 --> 4558.10]  people who
[4558.10 --> 4558.44]  think their
[4558.44 --> 4559.04]  computer's worth
[4559.04 --> 4559.48]  way too much
[4559.48 --> 4559.78]  we actually
[4559.78 --> 4560.20]  did one of
[4560.20 --> 4560.76]  those before
[4560.76 --> 4562.04]  um
[4562.04 --> 4564.38]  um
[4564.38 --> 4565.18]  tech memes
[4565.18 --> 4565.52]  don't leave
[4565.52 --> 4565.86]  the question
[4565.86 --> 4566.28]  I didn't
[4566.28 --> 4566.62]  leave the
[4566.62 --> 4567.06]  question
[4567.06 --> 4568.10]  uh
[4568.10 --> 4568.62]  reacting to
[4568.62 --> 4569.16]  old videos
[4569.16 --> 4569.48]  of ours
[4569.48 --> 4569.50]  we've actually
[4569.50 --> 4569.86]  found that
[4569.86 --> 4570.34]  more people
[4570.34 --> 4570.74]  will click
[4570.74 --> 4571.22]  the top
[4571.22 --> 4571.58]  option
[4571.58 --> 4571.88]  I put
[4571.88 --> 4572.30]  the top
[4572.30 --> 4572.62]  option
[4572.62 --> 4573.00]  as not
[4573.00 --> 4573.30]  the one
[4573.30 --> 4573.54]  that I
[4573.54 --> 4573.96]  was saying
[4573.96 --> 4575.28]  screw
[4575.28 --> 4575.76]  off
[4575.76 --> 4576.32]  they're right
[4576.32 --> 4576.56]  they don't
[4576.56 --> 4576.86]  like your
[4576.86 --> 4577.06]  poll
[4577.06 --> 4577.30]  and they're
[4577.30 --> 4577.52]  right
[4577.52 --> 4578.00]  no they're
[4578.00 --> 4578.28]  wrong
[4578.28 --> 4578.76]  um
[4578.76 --> 4579.04]  they're all
[4579.04 --> 4579.28]  wrong
[4579.28 --> 4579.58]  the whole
[4579.58 --> 4580.22]  the whole
[4580.22 --> 4580.56]  audience
[4580.56 --> 4581.10]  is wrong
[4581.10 --> 4581.84]  we've got
[4581.84 --> 4582.38]  reacting to
[4582.38 --> 4582.84]  old videos
[4582.84 --> 4583.26]  of ours
[4583.26 --> 4583.92]  so one of
[4583.92 --> 4584.48]  the suggestions
[4584.48 --> 4585.30]  was Linus
[4585.30 --> 4586.06]  finally watches
[4586.06 --> 4586.64]  what it's like
[4586.64 --> 4587.14]  to work for
[4587.14 --> 4587.46]  Linus
[4587.46 --> 4587.88]  and reacts
[4587.88 --> 4588.24]  to it
[4588.24 --> 4589.16]  which I
[4589.16 --> 4589.82]  commented on
[4589.82 --> 4590.12]  I said I
[4590.12 --> 4590.46]  won't do it
[4590.46 --> 4590.76]  you said you
[4590.76 --> 4591.26]  never would
[4591.26 --> 4591.48]  yeah
[4591.48 --> 4592.00]  I was like
[4592.00 --> 4592.46]  no we can't
[4592.46 --> 4592.86]  do that one
[4592.86 --> 4593.20]  that one's
[4593.20 --> 4593.60]  off limits
[4593.60 --> 4594.16]  but like
[4594.16 --> 4595.18]  overall that's
[4595.18 --> 4595.54]  not a bad
[4595.54 --> 4595.88]  idea
[4595.88 --> 4596.80]  um
[4596.80 --> 4599.20]  yeah
[4599.20 --> 4599.90]  best and worst
[4599.90 --> 4600.30]  of TikTok
[4600.30 --> 4600.94]  stuff like
[4600.94 --> 4601.54]  that but
[4601.54 --> 4602.16]  again that's
[4602.16 --> 4602.60]  getting into
[4602.60 --> 4603.28]  the gray area
[4603.28 --> 4603.78]  unless we're
[4603.78 --> 4604.66]  doing a really
[4604.66 --> 4605.30]  good job of
[4605.30 --> 4605.70]  reaching out
[4605.70 --> 4606.16]  to people
[4606.16 --> 4607.18]  um
[4607.18 --> 4607.60]  which
[4607.60 --> 4608.54]  I will
[4608.54 --> 4609.10]  I will tell
[4609.10 --> 4609.56]  you right
[4609.56 --> 4609.88]  now
[4609.88 --> 4610.72]  for our
[4610.72 --> 4611.28]  uh
[4611.28 --> 4611.56]  for our
[4611.56 --> 4612.26]  trying TikTok
[4612.26 --> 4612.78]  hacks
[4612.78 --> 4613.28]  videos in
[4613.28 --> 4613.70]  the past
[4613.70 --> 4614.30]  I don't
[4614.30 --> 4614.74]  think we've
[4614.74 --> 4615.08]  reached out
[4615.08 --> 4615.48]  to people
[4615.48 --> 4616.34]  however
[4616.34 --> 4617.04]  what we've
[4617.04 --> 4617.36]  done has
[4617.36 --> 4617.78]  been highly
[4617.78 --> 4618.28]  transformative
[4618.28 --> 4619.72]  we are
[4619.72 --> 4621.00]  we are
[4621.00 --> 4621.84]  actually doing
[4621.84 --> 4622.20]  things
[4622.20 --> 4622.66]  we're actually
[4622.66 --> 4623.10]  trying them
[4623.10 --> 4623.62]  I'm not
[4623.62 --> 4624.08]  eating a
[4624.08 --> 4624.44]  box of
[4624.44 --> 4624.74]  noodles
[4624.74 --> 4625.74]  while I
[4625.74 --> 4626.32]  watch other
[4626.32 --> 4626.68]  people's
[4626.68 --> 4627.08]  content
[4627.08 --> 4628.42]  um
[4628.42 --> 4629.18]  okay
[4629.18 --> 4629.60]  yeah
[4629.60 --> 4630.18]  yeah
[4630.18 --> 4630.40]  yeah
[4630.40 --> 4631.10]  so I
[4631.10 --> 4631.44]  think what
[4631.44 --> 4632.08]  it basically
[4632.08 --> 4632.78]  comes down
[4632.78 --> 4633.10]  to
[4633.10 --> 4634.16]  is just
[4634.16 --> 4635.14]  being ethical
[4635.14 --> 4635.74]  about it
[4635.74 --> 4637.38]  and adhering
[4637.38 --> 4638.06]  to the
[4638.06 --> 4638.80]  four pillars
[4638.80 --> 4639.56]  of fair use
[4639.56 --> 4640.12]  and making
[4640.12 --> 4640.94]  sure that
[4640.94 --> 4642.38]  regardless of
[4642.38 --> 4643.00]  who it is
[4643.00 --> 4643.52]  and whether
[4643.52 --> 4643.92]  they could
[4643.92 --> 4644.68]  afford to
[4644.68 --> 4645.02]  take us
[4645.02 --> 4645.38]  to court
[4645.38 --> 4645.88]  over it
[4645.88 --> 4647.10]  making sure
[4647.10 --> 4647.90]  that we
[4647.90 --> 4648.98]  would have
[4648.98 --> 4649.44]  a strong
[4649.44 --> 4649.96]  fair use
[4649.96 --> 4650.30]  argument
[4650.30 --> 4651.56]  that we
[4651.56 --> 4652.10]  believe
[4652.10 --> 4653.04]  with certainty
[4653.04 --> 4653.40]  that we
[4653.40 --> 4653.78]  would win
[4653.78 --> 4655.66]  that's I
[4655.66 --> 4655.98]  think the
[4655.98 --> 4656.50]  bottom line
[4656.50 --> 4657.32]  and or
[4657.32 --> 4658.32]  just getting
[4658.32 --> 4658.92]  permission from
[4658.92 --> 4659.32]  the original
[4659.32 --> 4659.74]  creator
[4659.74 --> 4661.04]  right
[4661.04 --> 4662.42]  that's where
[4662.42 --> 4663.20]  we're at
[4663.20 --> 4663.44]  on it
[4663.44 --> 4663.76]  because
[4663.76 --> 4664.66]  at this
[4664.66 --> 4665.00]  point
[4665.00 --> 4665.70]  like
[4665.70 --> 4666.86]  you're kind
[4666.86 --> 4667.22]  of stupid
[4667.22 --> 4667.88]  not to have
[4667.88 --> 4668.32]  a react
[4668.32 --> 4668.70]  channel
[4668.70 --> 4669.64]  it's kind
[4669.64 --> 4669.88]  of like
[4669.88 --> 4670.24]  a clips
[4670.24 --> 4670.58]  channel
[4670.58 --> 4670.80]  man
[4670.80 --> 4671.46]  do you guys
[4671.46 --> 4671.92]  have any
[4671.92 --> 4672.66]  idea how
[4672.66 --> 4673.16]  long they
[4673.16 --> 4673.64]  pushed me
[4673.64 --> 4674.24]  around here
[4674.24 --> 4674.76]  to do
[4674.76 --> 4675.28]  a clips
[4675.28 --> 4675.60]  channel
[4675.60 --> 4676.38]  for the
[4676.38 --> 4676.78]  WAN show
[4676.78 --> 4677.56]  do you know
[4677.56 --> 4678.32]  how successful
[4678.32 --> 4678.82]  the clips
[4678.82 --> 4679.34]  channel is
[4679.34 --> 4680.54]  I think it
[4680.54 --> 4680.98]  makes more
[4680.98 --> 4681.40]  money than
[4681.40 --> 4681.84]  the actual
[4681.84 --> 4682.42]  WAN show
[4682.42 --> 4683.46]  probably
[4683.46 --> 4684.20]  which is like
[4684.20 --> 4685.70]  how does that
[4685.70 --> 4686.26]  even make any
[4686.26 --> 4686.54]  sense
[4686.54 --> 4686.88]  it's just
[4686.88 --> 4687.14]  it like
[4687.14 --> 4688.10]  must actually
[4688.10 --> 4688.66]  yeah
[4688.66 --> 4689.76]  because you're
[4689.76 --> 4690.66]  dividing it up
[4690.66 --> 4691.10]  into a bunch
[4691.10 --> 4691.54]  of content
[4691.54 --> 4691.88]  and each
[4691.88 --> 4692.22]  one of those
[4692.22 --> 4692.78]  content pieces
[4692.78 --> 4693.38]  is doing well
[4693.38 --> 4694.22]  LMG clips
[4694.22 --> 4695.56]  gets 10 million
[4695.56 --> 4696.24]  views a month
[4696.24 --> 4696.62]  yeah
[4696.62 --> 4697.82]  it is actually
[4697.82 --> 4698.66]  in terms of
[4698.66 --> 4699.38]  just overall
[4699.38 --> 4700.12]  viewership
[4700.12 --> 4700.70]  it is on
[4700.70 --> 4701.06]  par
[4701.06 --> 4701.76]  with
[4701.76 --> 4703.54]  like what I
[4703.54 --> 4704.08]  would consider
[4704.08 --> 4704.92]  to be like
[4704.92 --> 4705.98]  like B tier
[4705.98 --> 4706.86]  tech channels
[4706.86 --> 4708.48]  and I'm sitting
[4708.48 --> 4708.88]  here going
[4708.88 --> 4710.08]  how is that
[4710.08 --> 4710.32]  even
[4710.32 --> 4710.88]  how is it
[4710.88 --> 4711.38]  even possible
[4711.38 --> 4712.10]  they know
[4712.10 --> 4712.68]  they can just
[4712.68 --> 4713.18]  they know
[4713.18 --> 4713.64]  they can just
[4713.64 --> 4714.10]  link to a
[4714.10 --> 4714.58]  timestamp
[4714.58 --> 4715.22]  in the WAN show
[4715.22 --> 4715.40]  right
[4715.40 --> 4716.16]  but that's
[4716.16 --> 4716.98]  not how people
[4716.98 --> 4717.62]  that's not how
[4717.62 --> 4718.12]  people engage
[4718.12 --> 4718.66]  with content
[4718.66 --> 4719.80]  they want it
[4719.80 --> 4720.04]  to be
[4720.04 --> 4720.64]  digestible
[4720.66 --> 4721.22]  and there's
[4721.22 --> 4722.36]  a huge
[4722.36 --> 4722.92]  contingent
[4722.92 --> 4723.50]  of our viewers
[4723.50 --> 4724.42]  that is
[4724.42 --> 4725.62]  absolutely
[4725.62 --> 4727.40]  just militantly
[4727.40 --> 4727.96]  opposed
[4727.96 --> 4728.56]  to watching
[4728.56 --> 4729.10]  long format
[4729.10 --> 4729.48]  content
[4729.48 --> 4730.26]  like the WAN show
[4730.26 --> 4731.84]  but does
[4731.84 --> 4732.48]  want to hear
[4732.48 --> 4733.18]  about what we
[4733.18 --> 4733.84]  talk about
[4733.84 --> 4734.62]  on the WAN show
[4734.62 --> 4735.10]  and I've said
[4735.10 --> 4735.48]  this before
[4735.48 --> 4737.08]  like I'm not
[4737.08 --> 4737.56]  going to sit down
[4737.56 --> 4737.94]  and watch the
[4737.94 --> 4738.48]  whole WAN show
[4738.48 --> 4739.12]  oh yeah
[4739.12 --> 4739.96]  Yvonne's the same
[4739.96 --> 4740.22]  way
[4740.22 --> 4740.58]  yeah
[4740.58 --> 4741.28]  she is
[4741.28 --> 4742.28]  she never
[4742.28 --> 4743.06]  looks at WAN show
[4743.06 --> 4744.10]  but she's like
[4744.10 --> 4745.12]  she'll devour
[4745.12 --> 4745.54]  clips
[4745.54 --> 4746.24]  she's like
[4746.24 --> 4746.58]  yeah what are
[4746.58 --> 4746.92]  Linus Luke
[4746.92 --> 4747.26]  talking about
[4747.26 --> 4747.52]  this week
[4747.52 --> 4748.56]  and I've
[4748.56 --> 4749.16]  always understood
[4749.16 --> 4749.76]  why people
[4749.76 --> 4750.46]  like the
[4750.46 --> 4751.84]  the
[4751.84 --> 4752.36]  the
[4752.36 --> 4752.66]  the
[4752.66 --> 4752.86]  the
[4752.86 --> 4753.32]  timestamp
[4753.32 --> 4753.54]  guy
[4753.54 --> 4754.50]  in the description
[4754.50 --> 4755.76]  or in the
[4755.76 --> 4756.44]  pinned comment
[4756.44 --> 4756.74]  sorry
[4756.74 --> 4757.82]  because like
[4757.82 --> 4758.74]  yeah it's a
[4758.74 --> 4759.18]  really
[4759.18 --> 4759.66]  especially
[4759.66 --> 4760.56]  lately man
[4760.56 --> 4761.94]  we've had
[4761.94 --> 4762.32]  some like
[4762.32 --> 4763.04]  three hour
[4763.04 --> 4763.76]  three and a half
[4763.76 --> 4764.40]  hour shows
[4764.40 --> 4765.02]  based on how
[4765.02 --> 4765.42]  many of our
[4765.42 --> 4765.98]  topics we've
[4765.98 --> 4766.52]  hit so far
[4766.52 --> 4766.82]  today
[4766.82 --> 4767.32]  this is going
[4767.32 --> 4767.68]  to be a
[4767.68 --> 4768.02]  marathon
[4768.02 --> 4771.42]  you down
[4771.42 --> 4771.78]  Dan
[4771.78 --> 4775.58]  like they
[4775.58 --> 4776.08]  they get
[4776.08 --> 4776.86]  pretty intense
[4776.86 --> 4777.40]  so being able
[4777.40 --> 4777.80]  to sit down
[4777.80 --> 4778.16]  and watch
[4778.16 --> 4778.52]  the whole thing
[4778.52 --> 4779.00]  especially in
[4779.00 --> 4779.42]  one sitting
[4779.42 --> 4779.74]  it's like
[4779.74 --> 4780.16]  it's like
[4780.16 --> 4780.64]  half a
[4780.64 --> 4781.12]  half a
[4781.12 --> 4781.58]  work day
[4781.58 --> 4782.14]  and you
[4782.14 --> 4782.52]  know what
[4782.52 --> 4783.08]  the reality
[4783.08 --> 4783.50]  of it is
[4783.50 --> 4783.84]  that a
[4783.84 --> 4784.32]  good title
[4784.32 --> 4784.82]  and thumbnail
[4784.82 --> 4785.44]  works

[4868.62 --> 4868.88]  YouTube
[4868.88 --> 4869.30]  short

[4872.88 --> 4873.46]  is
[4873.46 --> 4874.04]  goat
[4874.04 --> 4874.48]  moth
[4874.48 --> 4875.40]  but

[5205.74 --> 5206.34]  if this is going
[5206.34 --> 5206.90]  to be a regular
[5206.90 --> 5207.38]  segment
[5207.38 --> 5208.32]  I don't know

[5211.20 --> 5212.12]  but basically
[5212.12 --> 5213.30]  I asked
[5213.30 --> 5214.16]  for a wheel
[5214.16 --> 5215.58]  and I
[5215.58 --> 5216.28]  pitched kind
[5216.28 --> 5216.82]  of a fun

[5275.56 --> 5276.36]  refurbished
[5276.36 --> 5277.44]  screen imports
[5277.44 --> 5279.38]  AI art
[5279.38 --> 5279.90]  generators
[5279.90 --> 5280.78]  I feel like
[5280.78 --> 5281.22]  we should rule
[5281.22 --> 5281.76]  out AI art
[5281.76 --> 5282.10]  generators
[5282.10 --> 5282.54]  just because
[5282.54 --> 5282.98]  we've already
[5282.98 --> 5283.40]  talked about
[5283.40 --> 5283.70]  it on the
[5283.70 --> 5283.90]  show
[5283.90 --> 5285.86]  so if it
[5285.86 --> 5286.28]  lands on that
[5286.28 --> 5286.58]  we'll spin
[5286.58 --> 5286.86]  again
[5286.86 --> 5287.22]  yeah
[5287.22 --> 5289.20]  and Wyoming's
[5289.20 --> 5289.96]  bill that was
[5289.96 --> 5290.96]  introduced to
[5290.96 --> 5292.10]  phase out EV
[5292.10 --> 5293.04]  sales by
[5293.04 --> 5293.88]  2035
[5293.88 --> 5296.32]  okay
[5296.32 --> 5297.22]  okay
[5297.22 --> 5297.94]  okay do you
[5297.94 --> 5298.54]  want to go first
[5298.54 --> 5299.00]  or should I go first
[5299.00 --> 5299.74]  so wait what happens
[5299.74 --> 5301.18]  if the is the
[5301.18 --> 5302.22]  spinner defending it
[5302.22 --> 5303.54]  the spinner will defend
[5303.54 --> 5304.88]  whatever topic comes up
[5304.88 --> 5305.26]  okay
[5305.26 --> 5305.78]  on the wheel
[5305.78 --> 5306.74]  of pain
[5306.74 --> 5307.80]  I don't care who goes
[5307.80 --> 5308.06]  first
[5308.06 --> 5308.56]  okay
[5308.56 --> 5309.20]  whatever works
[5309.20 --> 5309.72]  go for it
[5309.72 --> 5310.06]  okay
[5310.06 --> 5312.08]  either way right
[5312.08 --> 5312.80]  yeah I don't think
[5312.80 --> 5314.54]  wow really that's your
[5314.54 --> 5315.28]  spin that's weak
[5315.28 --> 5315.62]  no
[5315.62 --> 5316.68]  you can't spin it
[5316.68 --> 5317.08]  again
[5317.08 --> 5317.82]  I didn't see what it
[5317.82 --> 5318.40]  was so it doesn't
[5318.40 --> 5318.66]  matter
[5318.66 --> 5319.50]  well they did
[5319.50 --> 5321.06]  you must def
[5321.06 --> 5321.96]  oh no
[5321.96 --> 5322.56]  what is it
[5322.56 --> 5323.38]  oh no
[5323.38 --> 5324.84]  you must defend
[5324.84 --> 5326.46]  twitter banning
[5326.46 --> 5328.76]  third party apps
[5328.76 --> 5331.12]  I feel like I should
[5331.12 --> 5331.86]  run through
[5331.86 --> 5332.88]  so here's how we'll do it
[5332.88 --> 5333.86]  sorry guys this is our
[5333.86 --> 5334.48]  first time doing it
[5334.48 --> 5335.10]  we should talk about
[5335.10 --> 5335.52]  the topic
[5335.52 --> 5336.36]  I will run through
[5336.36 --> 5336.92]  the topic
[5336.92 --> 5337.32]  okay
[5337.32 --> 5338.74]  and then you
[5338.74 --> 5340.02]  will defend it
[5340.02 --> 5340.84]  yeah I like it
[5340.84 --> 5342.00]  last Thursday
[5342.00 --> 5344.48]  all or nearly all
[5344.48 --> 5346.14]  third party twitter apps
[5346.14 --> 5346.94]  broke
[5346.94 --> 5348.46]  the same day
[5348.46 --> 5349.98]  a clause was quietly
[5349.98 --> 5350.80]  added to its
[5350.80 --> 5351.70]  developer agreement
[5351.70 --> 5352.86]  banning the creation
[5352.86 --> 5354.44]  of a substitute
[5354.44 --> 5356.00]  or similar service
[5356.00 --> 5356.80]  to the twitter
[5356.80 --> 5357.48]  application
[5357.48 --> 5359.02]  so in effect
[5359.02 --> 5360.06]  I don't even remember
[5360.06 --> 5360.80]  some of the names
[5360.80 --> 5361.88]  of third party twitter
[5361.88 --> 5362.84]  clients that I've used
[5362.84 --> 5363.34]  in the past
[5363.34 --> 5364.32]  but I have used them
[5364.32 --> 5364.72]  Hootsuite
[5364.72 --> 5366.14]  yeah yeah sure
[5366.14 --> 5366.80]  okay yeah
[5366.80 --> 5367.88]  in effect
[5367.88 --> 5369.52]  tools like Hootsuite
[5369.52 --> 5370.26]  or no
[5370.26 --> 5371.28]  there used to be like
[5371.28 --> 5371.94]  okay for example
[5371.94 --> 5372.66]  on Windows phone
[5372.66 --> 5373.70]  there wasn't a first
[5373.70 --> 5374.44]  party twitter client
[5374.44 --> 5375.36]  there was like
[5375.36 --> 5376.36]  a third party one
[5376.36 --> 5376.90]  that just hooked
[5376.90 --> 5377.58]  into the API
[5377.58 --> 5378.16]  and made it
[5378.16 --> 5378.60]  you know
[5378.60 --> 5379.28]  it wasn't great
[5379.28 --> 5379.88]  but it was usable
[5379.88 --> 5383.90]  after a long silence
[5383.90 --> 5385.30]  twitter has announced
[5385.30 --> 5387.06]  that it was simply
[5387.06 --> 5388.46]  enforcing its
[5388.46 --> 5390.26]  long-standing API rules
[5390.26 --> 5391.88]  which may result in
[5391.88 --> 5392.52]  some apps
[5392.52 --> 5393.40]  not working
[5393.40 --> 5395.00]  twitter has not
[5395.00 --> 5395.68]  responded to
[5395.68 --> 5396.62]  any questions
[5396.62 --> 5397.64]  about which
[5397.64 --> 5398.58]  long-standing rules
[5398.58 --> 5399.06]  were broken
[5399.06 --> 5399.56]  well they don't have
[5399.56 --> 5400.14]  a PR department
[5400.14 --> 5401.00]  questions that were
[5401.00 --> 5402.92]  posed by prominent
[5402.92 --> 5403.68]  members of the tech
[5403.68 --> 5404.72]  community like our
[5404.72 --> 5406.06]  our friend over
[5406.06 --> 5407.06]  at MKBHD
[5407.06 --> 5408.48]  one Marquez Keith
[5408.48 --> 5409.38]  Brownlee in high
[5409.38 --> 5409.80]  definition
[5409.80 --> 5415.48]  in 2021
[5415.48 --> 5417.00]  twitter had actually
[5417.00 --> 5418.36]  removed a clause
[5418.36 --> 5419.64]  discouraging but not
[5419.64 --> 5420.56]  banning third party
[5420.56 --> 5421.76]  apps as a way of
[5421.76 --> 5422.70]  building a warmer
[5422.70 --> 5423.98]  relationship with
[5423.98 --> 5424.84]  these developers
[5424.84 --> 5427.92]  in other news
[5427.92 --> 5429.04]  twitter is now being
[5429.04 --> 5430.02]  sued by a consulting
[5430.02 --> 5431.10]  firm claiming that it
[5431.10 --> 5432.08]  has not been paid for
[5432.08 --> 5432.96]  services rendered to
[5432.96 --> 5433.64]  twitter during its
[5433.64 --> 5434.58]  lawsuit to force
[5434.58 --> 5435.20]  musk to follow
[5435.20 --> 5435.70]  through on his
[5435.70 --> 5436.22]  purchase of the
[5436.22 --> 5436.92]  company that's
[5436.92 --> 5437.64]  really funny
[5437.64 --> 5439.84]  okay we'll talk
[5439.84 --> 5440.32]  about that more
[5440.32 --> 5441.28]  later that's really
[5441.28 --> 5442.18]  really funny anyway
[5442.18 --> 5444.34]  um okay
[5444.34 --> 5448.10]  i think you saw
[5448.10 --> 5448.84]  i think you still
[5448.84 --> 5450.00]  have isn't there
[5450.00 --> 5450.58]  one more thing
[5450.58 --> 5453.10]  nope oh that's just
[5453.10 --> 5453.76]  not very interesting
[5453.76 --> 5456.92]  okay twitter is
[5456.92 --> 5457.86]  going through a
[5457.86 --> 5459.34]  a refacing right
[5459.34 --> 5460.16]  now it has a new
[5460.16 --> 5461.16]  ceo it has a lot of
[5461.16 --> 5461.96]  new employees it has
[5461.96 --> 5462.84]  a lot less total
[5462.84 --> 5463.60]  employees does it
[5463.60 --> 5464.34]  have a lot of new
[5464.34 --> 5465.54]  employees i believe
[5465.54 --> 5466.70]  so don't they didn't
[5466.70 --> 5467.38]  they aren't they
[5467.38 --> 5468.70]  hiring twitter yeah
[5468.70 --> 5471.22]  twitter yeah didn't
[5471.22 --> 5472.38]  they let go like 75
[5472.38 --> 5472.84]  percent of their
[5472.84 --> 5473.40]  workforce i think
[5473.40 --> 5474.12]  they're also hiring
[5474.12 --> 5475.58]  oh okay yeah okay
[5475.58 --> 5476.28]  so they've got new
[5476.28 --> 5477.32]  employees true okay
[5477.32 --> 5477.88]  what does that have
[5477.88 --> 5478.30]  to do with anything
[5478.30 --> 5479.34]  employees oh yeah did
[5479.34 --> 5480.04]  i mention that the
[5480.04 --> 5480.84]  other person is allowed
[5480.84 --> 5481.84]  to poke holes in your
[5481.84 --> 5483.90]  defense the whole time
[5483.90 --> 5484.74]  sure yeah i haven't
[5484.74 --> 5485.84]  made one yet so maybe
[5485.84 --> 5487.20]  you can sit the f down
[5487.20 --> 5492.08]  this is gonna be so
[5492.08 --> 5495.26]  hard no you have to
[5495.26 --> 5495.80]  be straight-faced
[5495.80 --> 5496.44]  you're not allowed to
[5496.44 --> 5497.30]  acknowledge it all
[5497.30 --> 5498.32]  right yeah okay so
[5498.32 --> 5499.18]  yeah they have a new
[5499.18 --> 5500.02]  face and they need to
[5500.02 --> 5500.76]  be able to control
[5500.76 --> 5502.22]  their image because
[5502.22 --> 5503.38]  their image matters
[5503.38 --> 5504.54]  right and having all
[5504.54 --> 5505.40]  these third-party apps
[5505.40 --> 5506.54]  running around making
[5506.54 --> 5508.28]  custom experiences that
[5508.28 --> 5509.24]  are different to what
[5509.24 --> 5510.14]  they are trying to
[5510.14 --> 5510.94]  tailor make for the
[5510.94 --> 5512.06]  audience could be bad
[5512.06 --> 5513.22]  for the platform and
[5513.22 --> 5514.70]  they should enforce
[5514.70 --> 5516.06]  various rules that they
[5516.06 --> 5516.98]  have you shouldn't just
[5516.98 --> 5518.12]  set rules and then not
[5518.12 --> 5519.06]  enforce them it can be
[5519.06 --> 5519.90]  frustrating to be on a
[5519.90 --> 5521.62]  platform where the
[5521.62 --> 5522.62]  rules are really loosey
[5522.62 --> 5523.26]  goosey and they get
[5523.26 --> 5524.54]  applied to some people
[5524.54 --> 5525.24]  in a certain way and
[5525.24 --> 5525.86]  other people in a
[5525.86 --> 5526.78]  certain way it's a lot
[5526.78 --> 5528.00]  easier if it's very
[5528.00 --> 5529.14]  clear what you can and
[5529.14 --> 5530.30]  cannot do so if rules
[5530.30 --> 5531.42]  exist okay it should be
[5531.42 --> 5532.64]  enforced no no no i
[5532.64 --> 5533.32]  have to stop you right
[5533.32 --> 5534.30]  there because it's
[5534.30 --> 5536.38]  obviously not clear what
[5536.38 --> 5537.82]  rules what they're
[5537.82 --> 5539.00]  trying to make it clear
[5539.00 --> 5539.86]  that no they're not
[5539.86 --> 5540.68]  trying to make it clear
[5540.68 --> 5542.12]  they're not responding oh
[5542.12 --> 5542.68]  they don't have a PR
[5542.68 --> 5544.20]  department when people but
[5544.20 --> 5544.94]  that's not part of the
[5544.94 --> 5545.68]  debate so it's okay
[5545.68 --> 5549.02]  no that is not okay
[5549.02 --> 5552.44]  because a key foundational
[5552.44 --> 5554.14]  piece of your argument is
[5554.14 --> 5555.10]  that they are trying to
[5555.10 --> 5556.10]  improve the clarity of
[5556.10 --> 5557.04]  their rules yeah by
[5557.04 --> 5557.96]  enforcing them by
[5557.96 --> 5560.62]  enforcing them but if no
[5560.62 --> 5562.22]  one can figure out what
[5562.22 --> 5563.42]  rules are being violated
[5563.42 --> 5564.94]  then they obviously aren't
[5564.94 --> 5565.94]  clear enough oh just don't
[5565.94 --> 5567.68]  make third-party apps just
[5567.68 --> 5568.54]  don't make third-party
[5568.54 --> 5569.88]  apps that's not a defense of
[5569.88 --> 5572.14]  it that's the conclusion of
[5572.14 --> 5574.88]  it yeah but that's okay so
[5574.88 --> 5576.14]  you're just saying it's okay
[5576.14 --> 5577.44]  yeah just don't make
[5577.44 --> 5578.22]  third-party fundamentally
[5578.22 --> 5581.10]  that's all you got what i
[5581.10 --> 5582.60]  think it's fine twitter
[5582.60 --> 5584.46]  doesn't twitter doesn't want
[5584.46 --> 5586.02]  you to make third-party apps
[5586.02 --> 5586.88]  so don't make third-party
[5586.88 --> 5588.52]  apps i it seems pretty clear
[5588.52 --> 5589.82]  to me i don't see why they
[5589.82 --> 5590.90]  would need a PR department
[5590.90 --> 5592.22]  because the answer is very
[5592.22 --> 5593.56]  obvious don't make third
[5593.56 --> 5595.56]  party i see and uh just to
[5595.56 --> 5597.10]  kind of bring us back a little
[5597.10 --> 5598.56]  bit to your argument that
[5598.56 --> 5600.16]  twitter is concerned about the
[5600.16 --> 5601.38]  image that it presents to the
[5601.38 --> 5602.66]  rest of the world of course and
[5602.66 --> 5604.06]  the damage that third-party
[5604.06 --> 5608.54]  apps could do to it i mean do
[5608.54 --> 5609.82]  i even have to explain how
[5609.82 --> 5611.94]  wrong that is twitter is doing
[5611.94 --> 5613.32]  all trying to release new
[5613.32 --> 5614.40]  features they're trying to
[5614.40 --> 5616.08]  release new functionality and
[5616.08 --> 5617.64]  if these third-party apps don't
[5617.64 --> 5618.90]  support those features and
[5618.90 --> 5620.70]  functionality then those aren't
[5620.70 --> 5622.12]  going to get to the users the
[5622.12 --> 5624.00]  the image the the way that
[5624.00 --> 5625.92]  people interpret and and use
[5625.92 --> 5627.60]  twitter could be deeply
[5627.60 --> 5628.88]  affected by these third-party
[5628.88 --> 5630.56]  apps not responding and
[5630.56 --> 5631.80]  reflecting the experience that
[5631.80 --> 5633.08]  twitter is trying to create for
[5633.08 --> 5635.24]  its users so maybe they just
[5635.24 --> 5636.50]  shouldn't exist and if it
[5636.50 --> 5637.92]  follows the rules to get rid of
[5637.92 --> 5639.16]  them well they should get rid of
[5639.16 --> 5640.14]  them because they should enforce
[5640.14 --> 5643.94]  their rules i see so if your
[5643.94 --> 5646.42]  goal in life is to have your
[5646.42 --> 5648.26]  product be as much of a dumpster
[5648.26 --> 5650.02]  fire as possible then you are
[5650.02 --> 5651.94]  well within your rights to ensure
[5651.94 --> 5653.90]  that every user who interacts with
[5653.90 --> 5655.76]  it experiences the full dumpster
[5655.76 --> 5657.00]  fire i wouldn't word it that way
[5657.00 --> 5659.08]  but they are fully within their
[5659.08 --> 5663.44]  rights correct okay your argument
[5663.44 --> 5665.74]  boils down to legally they're within
[5665.74 --> 5666.30]  their rights
[5666.30 --> 5670.26]  that is a true state i again
[5670.26 --> 5671.48]  wouldn't word it that way but that
[5671.48 --> 5673.12]  is a true statement again they're
[5673.12 --> 5674.72]  they're creating new features
[5674.72 --> 5678.42]  there's i uh i believe there's i'm not
[5678.42 --> 5679.82]  super familiar with twitter features
[5679.82 --> 5682.34]  but i believe there's new home feed
[5682.34 --> 5684.90]  i believe there's new feeds in your
[5684.90 --> 5687.26]  home i don't know okay i don't know
[5687.26 --> 5689.02]  twitter features very well but if the
[5689.02 --> 5690.40]  third-party apps don't reflect that
[5690.40 --> 5691.76]  and that's a big thing that they want
[5691.76 --> 5693.76]  to push because they have this massive
[5693.76 --> 5695.62]  wave of new users so clearly they're
[5695.62 --> 5697.96]  doing something right um and their
[5697.96 --> 5699.48]  servers have not gone down despite
[5699.48 --> 5700.58]  everyone saying that they would
[5700.58 --> 5705.38]  uh they want to push twitter in a new
[5705.38 --> 5707.00]  direction and you don't want third
[5707.00 --> 5708.88]  party people controlling what direction
[5708.88 --> 5710.46]  your platform is able to go in okay
[5710.46 --> 5712.44]  they're able to do imagine you were
[5712.44 --> 5714.06]  releasing videos all right and you
[5714.06 --> 5715.80]  started releasing a new type of video
[5715.80 --> 5717.80]  but some third-party thing was just
[5717.80 --> 5719.44]  like we're just not going to release
[5719.44 --> 5720.86]  that type of video whenever they
[5720.86 --> 5723.84]  release it would that annoy you as a
[5723.84 --> 5725.54]  video creator but what about user
[5725.54 --> 5727.48]  choice would it annoy you as a video
[5727.48 --> 5729.56]  creator as a video creator if someone
[5729.56 --> 5733.30]  created a curated feed of my videos if
[5733.30 --> 5735.98]  you started making no new and that's
[5735.98 --> 5737.68]  the reason no and that's the reason
[5737.68 --> 5739.30]  that twitter has engaged with these
[5739.30 --> 5741.18]  third-party apps over the course of
[5741.18 --> 5742.86]  their entire history is because
[5742.86 --> 5745.54]  overall they benefit from a broader
[5745.54 --> 5748.16]  ecosystem compared to a closed more
[5748.16 --> 5749.90]  narrow one if you were using twitch
[5749.90 --> 5753.68]  sure and you make a fix to say twitch
[5753.68 --> 5755.52]  does more things than it does say
[5755.52 --> 5757.12]  twitch actually was successful when
[5757.12 --> 5760.32]  they tried to do vods sure shots fired
[5760.32 --> 5764.18]  um and you started releasing a new type
[5764.18 --> 5767.74]  review content and it's compatible with
[5767.74 --> 5771.12]  twitch but twitch just decides to not
[5771.12 --> 5772.94]  upgrade that i don't know say it's like
[5772.94 --> 5776.04]  av1 or something sure and uh twitch
[5776.04 --> 5777.92]  doesn't update so a bunch of users on
[5777.92 --> 5779.98]  twitch are now unable to view those
[5779.98 --> 5782.34]  videos but you've curated a massive user
[5782.34 --> 5785.42]  base on twitch mm-hmm that sees your
[5785.42 --> 5787.42]  standard content so now you have these
[5787.42 --> 5789.40]  weird segmented content yeah you have
[5789.40 --> 5791.62]  some stuff that's going on yeah and and
[5791.62 --> 5793.50]  stuff that can't go on twitch yeah and
[5793.50 --> 5795.18]  if that's they're refusing to update
[5795.18 --> 5796.66]  their platform and if that third party
[5796.66 --> 5799.44]  if that third party platform doesn't
[5799.44 --> 5801.74]  update then obviously they're going to
[5801.74 --> 5803.72]  shed users through natural attrition
[5803.72 --> 5805.72]  communicate to those users directly
[5805.72 --> 5806.50]  about this
[5806.50 --> 5807.50]  um
[5807.50 --> 5811.74]  communication to those users is
[5811.74 --> 5813.44]  controlled by that platform why is
[5813.44 --> 5814.96]  this a good thing for you there's no
[5814.96 --> 5815.32]  benefit
[5815.32 --> 5819.94]  the the benefit is kill all third party
[5819.94 --> 5821.98]  apps okay so you can actually control
[5821.98 --> 5824.52]  feature functionality all right so uh the
[5824.52 --> 5826.86]  last new rule i'm going to add to this
[5826.86 --> 5828.20]  segment is that we're going to have to
[5828.20 --> 5829.62]  add a time limit because that took too
[5829.62 --> 5829.82]  long
[5829.82 --> 5833.52]  yeah fair and uh two our adjudicator will
[5833.52 --> 5834.10]  be dan
[5834.10 --> 5837.44]  uh so dan can you give luke a rating out
[5837.44 --> 5840.32]  of 10 for his defense of twitter just
[5840.32 --> 5843.84]  cutting off third party apps i don't know
[5843.84 --> 5845.60]  that did seem pretty weak i'm probably
[5845.60 --> 5846.80]  going to give you a three out of ten
[5846.80 --> 5849.40]  because they're legally allowed to do
[5849.40 --> 5849.72]  it
[5849.72 --> 5853.84]  like no that's that's kind of weak that
[5853.84 --> 5855.60]  wasn't my argument that's that's
[5855.60 --> 5857.44]  because i said your argument wasn't
[5857.44 --> 5858.88]  clear then it's still a three out of ten
[5858.88 --> 5859.36]  defense
[5859.36 --> 5861.06]  okay i need to make sure that i just
[5861.06 --> 5861.68]  completely
[5861.68 --> 5864.92]  oh you do the thing that you don't like
[5864.92 --> 5867.00]  oh what did i do
[5867.00 --> 5869.82]  i need to shadow ban linus
[5869.82 --> 5871.14]  what did i do
[5871.14 --> 5874.10]  it just wasn't my argument and that
[5874.10 --> 5875.26]  you said that it was
[5875.26 --> 5877.56]  no i didn't say it was yeah you did
[5877.56 --> 5880.04]  when just now that dan said it he
[5880.04 --> 5882.42]  regurgitated what you said well that
[5882.42 --> 5883.86]  was the argument you were making at the
[5883.86 --> 5883.96]  time
[5883.96 --> 5885.68]  no it wasn't fine that was when i was
[5885.68 --> 5887.10]  paying i was saying if they're going to
[5887.10 --> 5889.04]  have rules they should enforce them i
[5889.04 --> 5890.88]  wasn't saying that it's legally within
[5890.88 --> 5891.38]  their rights
[5891.38 --> 5893.30]  yeah but they don't they they haven't
[5893.30 --> 5894.84]  made these rules clear they don't seem
[5894.84 --> 5895.46]  to have them
[5895.46 --> 5899.18]  you can't if they had these rules then
[5899.18 --> 5900.74]  they should reply and say what the
[5900.74 --> 5902.96]  rules are but it's clear that they
[5902.96 --> 5905.12]  don't want anyone to know what the
[5905.12 --> 5907.00]  rules are because then they might be
[5907.00 --> 5909.42]  able to adjust their third-party apps
[5909.42 --> 5911.26]  to adhere to the rules but they don't
[5911.26 --> 5914.80]  want third-party apps and that i will
[5914.80 --> 5916.08]  that's fair enough
[5916.08 --> 5919.26]  yeah but did but to say that they want
[5919.26 --> 5922.74]  clarity in their rules that's a bad
[5922.74 --> 5923.96]  that's a bad argument say they want
[5923.96 --> 5925.78]  clarity you did say they want to
[5925.78 --> 5928.06]  enforce them this is going to be a great
[5928.06 --> 5928.90]  segment
[5928.90 --> 5930.66]  it's already great i'm already angry
[5930.66 --> 5932.64]  yeah i don't think i've seen him this
[5932.64 --> 5933.68]  fired up in forever
[5933.68 --> 5935.72]  i can talk again i got a lot of
[5935.72 --> 5936.84]  pent-up energy
[5936.84 --> 5939.70]  okay so i mean yeah they don't want
[5939.70 --> 5942.62]  apps right luke but yeah but why
[5942.62 --> 5945.28]  shouldn't they allow apps if it dilutes
[5945.28 --> 5947.66]  their brand is it because they're worse
[5947.66 --> 5950.52]  than what twitter's making yes yeah oh
[5950.52 --> 5953.08]  come on i mean that's that's come on
[5953.08 --> 5955.02]  okay dan you still have to rate it we
[5955.02 --> 5957.40]  still have to move on i'm moving up
[5957.40 --> 5959.44]  there's a poll on the twitter argument
[5959.44 --> 5959.98]  and i'm winning
[5959.98 --> 5961.70]  four out of ten sixty seven percent
[5961.70 --> 5963.04]  all right you managed to get an extra
[5963.04 --> 5965.30]  point are you happy extra point four out
[5965.30 --> 5967.46]  of ten i'm gonna burn this court to the
[5967.46 --> 5967.86]  ground
[5967.86 --> 5970.96]  all right okay i'll put a timer and i'll
[5970.96 --> 5973.28]  make some things for next time okay it'll
[5973.28 --> 5973.90]  be fancy
[5973.90 --> 5978.30]  the real main reason for it yes it boils
[5978.30 --> 5980.52]  down to they simply don't want third-party
[5980.52 --> 5982.38]  apps has nothing to do with the rules it
[5982.38 --> 5985.68]  has nothing to do with any kind of um what
[5985.68 --> 5987.24]  if the rules that there's no third party
[5987.24 --> 5988.92]  app it has nothing to do with any well
[5988.92 --> 5990.78]  that isn't though it has nothing to do
[5990.78 --> 5993.06]  with any kind of benefit of having a
[5993.06 --> 5996.06]  smaller ecosystem other than that many
[5996.06 --> 6002.42]  third-party apps do not display ads so
[6002.42 --> 6008.46]  twitter is trying desperately desperately to
[6008.46 --> 6010.44]  something i don't know was that not
[6010.44 --> 6011.86]  defendable i feel like that would be
[6011.86 --> 6013.30]  easier to defend than what i just
[6013.30 --> 6015.78]  defended it could be it could be but
[6015.78 --> 6017.48]  because now you're fighting against your
[6017.48 --> 6018.04]  own argument
[6018.04 --> 6020.24]  sure but you're also fighting against your
[6020.24 --> 6021.86]  own partners and your own users
[6021.86 --> 6025.62]  your user your partners you have you
[6025.62 --> 6027.08]  have you're defending adblock
[6027.08 --> 6030.98]  so no yeah what you could do
[6030.98 --> 6033.16]  if it doesn't send ads and it uses twitter's
[6033.16 --> 6035.60]  service there's a correct way to update
[6035.60 --> 6038.46]  your api rules the correct way is you give
[6038.46 --> 6041.80]  a time window for compliance and you
[6041.80 --> 6045.00]  create transparent well-communicated
[6045.00 --> 6047.56]  rules and those transparent well-communicated
[6047.56 --> 6049.60]  rules include hey you have to display ads at
[6049.60 --> 6051.36]  the same rate that the original twitter app does
[6051.36 --> 6053.26]  don't want and then pretty apps at all
[6053.26 --> 6054.60]  unless they just don't want third-party
[6054.60 --> 6057.48]  apps which is i mean ultimately what you
[6057.48 --> 6062.06]  said which is right but it's not a
[6062.06 --> 6065.18]  defense it's a statement of fact but
[6065.18 --> 6069.24]  it's not a defense it's still crappy it's
[6069.24 --> 6073.30]  bad partnership it's bad management now i
[6073.30 --> 6076.20]  get to play sure all right i'm only
[6076.20 --> 6078.10]  familiar with some of these topics final
[6078.10 --> 6078.54]  statement
[6078.54 --> 6082.88]  um is it this oh it's the ai art
[6082.88 --> 6084.16]  generators one okay i'll try again it's
[6084.16 --> 6085.92]  been again yeah this is hard to spin i
[6085.92 --> 6087.04]  shouldn't have made fun of your weak spin
[6087.04 --> 6089.12]  because the monitor the screens are any
[6089.12 --> 6091.30]  better bloody hell did i just get ai
[6091.30 --> 6093.18]  art generous again yeah i did
[6093.18 --> 6095.72]  crying out loud okay i'll give it a
[6095.72 --> 6097.00]  process get away from the screens yeah
[6097.00 --> 6099.30]  there you go there we go let's go
[6099.30 --> 6102.96]  okay oh no
[6102.96 --> 6108.00]  samsung screen patent okay luke tell us
[6108.00 --> 6109.76]  about it i gotta find it one sec
[6109.76 --> 6118.14]  where is it i guess i can control it yeah
[6118.14 --> 6119.46]  it's in the dock it's in the dock
[6119.46 --> 6136.02]  for next time in the section of devil's
[6136.02 --> 6138.72]  advocate the topic list should be
[6138.72 --> 6141.34]  hyperlinked yes i there's you know what
[6141.34 --> 6142.74]  there's a lot of things that we could do
[6142.74 --> 6144.76]  better we're just it's a small thing i
[6144.76 --> 6146.14]  wasn't really we're trying stuff right
[6146.14 --> 6147.82]  like we want to we want to kind of try
[6147.82 --> 6151.38]  to we want to kind of try to without
[6151.38 --> 6155.32]  losing track of what the when show is we
[6155.32 --> 6157.00]  want to kind of try and find some novel
[6157.00 --> 6159.96]  ways to engage with these topics is
[6159.96 --> 6161.28]  basically the goal here i hope you guys
[6161.28 --> 6164.06]  are enjoying it i am actually like man
[6164.06 --> 6166.68]  he's getting fired up i like it so this
[6166.68 --> 6167.90]  is the reason why i couldn't find it was
[6167.90 --> 6169.88]  this is the u.s farmers win right to
[6169.88 --> 6172.94]  repair argument uh or right to repair
[6172.94 --> 6176.12]  farm equipment while samsung undermines
[6176.12 --> 6177.98]  independent screen repair there's been a
[6177.98 --> 6180.50]  bunch of posts in float plane chat um
[6180.50 --> 6183.64]  that this isn't legit we'll see oh
[6183.64 --> 6185.76]  through how this is written how legit
[6185.76 --> 6188.66]  that we say it is okay um but people are
[6188.66 --> 6190.56]  saying that apparently this john deere
[6190.56 --> 6192.86]  didn't actually do that and lewis
[6192.86 --> 6195.86]  rossman has a video about it then i
[6195.86 --> 6197.38]  guess we'll okay we'll see what the
[6197.38 --> 6198.94]  notes say yeah we'll see i guess it'll
[6198.94 --> 6200.90]  be good feedback for our new notes
[6200.90 --> 6203.86]  creator yeah this month john deere signed
[6203.86 --> 6205.58]  a memorandum of understanding with the
[6205.58 --> 6207.64]  american farm bureau an agricultural
[6207.64 --> 6211.08]  lobbyist oh great uh acknowledging the
[6211.08 --> 6214.38]  american farmers god-given right to fix
[6214.38 --> 6216.20]  their own equipment including bringing it
[6216.20 --> 6218.90]  to independent repair facilities the move
[6218.90 --> 6221.66]  follows years of efforts by john deere to
[6221.66 --> 6223.88]  lock down its products which make up over
[6223.88 --> 6226.20]  50 percent of the u.s tractors and
[6226.20 --> 6228.92]  combines market farmers have long reported
[6228.92 --> 6231.36]  huge delays during planting and harvesting
[6231.36 --> 6234.60]  uh due to planting and harvest due to
[6234.60 --> 6237.24]  repair times uh there is hope that this
[6237.24 --> 6239.38]  memorandum might act as a framework for
[6239.38 --> 6242.72]  future law but similar to new york's recent
[6242.72 --> 6244.66]  right to repair legislation these kinds of
[6244.66 --> 6246.70]  agreements are often riddled with caveats and
[6246.70 --> 6249.40]  loopholes i do believe that's like the
[6249.40 --> 6252.96]  issue um voluntary standards are not
[6252.96 --> 6255.30]  enforceable and the language of the memorandum is
[6255.30 --> 6258.52]  vague oh that's an issue right so
[6258.52 --> 6260.82]  oh i'm not allowed to say anything in
[6260.82 --> 6264.46]  2018 john deere signed a similar agreement with
[6264.46 --> 6266.50]  the california farm bureau to limited
[6266.50 --> 6269.02]  effect and john deere has agreed to provide
[6269.02 --> 6271.38]  its repair tools for sale as well as
[6271.38 --> 6273.52]  granting access to manuals product guides and
[6273.52 --> 6277.24]  diagnostic codes okay meanwhile and i think
[6277.24 --> 6278.84]  this is the actual part that we're talking
[6278.84 --> 6281.24]  about because i think this just said samsung
[6281.24 --> 6284.22]  yeah it did okay so meanwhile samsung is now
[6284.22 --> 6286.78]  attempting to use an old oled patent to get
[6286.78 --> 6289.32]  certain aftermarket and refurbished device screens
[6289.32 --> 6292.16]  banned from import into the united states
[6292.16 --> 6298.78]  thanks to buy underscore mew m-i-e-w mew who posted a link to this on the
[6298.78 --> 6302.04]  lct forum this would restrict buyers from getting their phones repaired
[6302.04 --> 6306.56]  solely from the original vendor or licensed partners which means the
[6306.56 --> 6308.44]  company can simply refuse to fix it
[6308.44 --> 6313.26]  samsung argues that this proposed ban is in part to protect consumers from
[6313.26 --> 6315.00]  inferior or defective products
[6315.00 --> 6322.14]  samsung has also added some tools and parts to its self-repair program with iFixit for galaxy
[6322.14 --> 6330.94]  s22 phones and some galaxy laptops some tools and parts who knows if it's all of them uh there are
[6330.94 --> 6335.18]  still tons of devices that aren't covered and the program appears to focus primarily on
[6335.18 --> 6341.32]  flagship products from the last three years excluding easily broken foldables and popular
[6341.32 --> 6347.74]  budget models the replacement screen for the galaxy s22 lineup comes bundled with a replacement battery
[6347.74 --> 6353.58]  and frame it is not available separately and tons of other parts just aren't available at all
[6354.54 --> 6359.34]  do we do the discussion topics when we do no i don't think so i don't think so either
[6361.50 --> 6363.02]  okay i get to go now yes
[6363.02 --> 6373.98]  i think this one is actually pretty simple to defend and the reason for that nice essay intro
[6374.54 --> 6378.70]  is that well i'm buying time obviously i know
[6381.18 --> 6390.46]  okay the reason for that is that as you made an argument for very recently actually i am samsung right
[6390.46 --> 6396.22]  so i'm i'm taking i'm taking on the role of samsung so i am well within my right to defend my patent
[6396.22 --> 6401.98]  if someone has a problem with my patent uh and thinks that for whatever reason they should be able to
[6401.98 --> 6408.30]  import their own inferior or knockoff products that violate it well then the correct legal process for
[6408.30 --> 6411.82]  them to go through is this defending a patent it didn't say anything about defending a patent yeah yeah
[6411.82 --> 6417.26]  yeah yeah they they're using their oled patent to get aftermarket and refurbished device screens
[6417.26 --> 6423.58]  banned from importing to the us okay and so if i hold a patent on these devices well at the end of the day
[6424.22 --> 6432.94]  i have to defend my patent and besides there should be no reason that a user who purchased an authentic samsung device
[6432.94 --> 6437.98]  made up out of completely authentic samsung parts should want an inferior part
[6439.82 --> 6444.06]  why would they if they wanted an inferior part well then they could it's irrelevant what they want
[6444.06 --> 6447.66]  well then they could go buy something from some other vendor you shouldn't be deciding what the
[6447.66 --> 6452.62]  user wants well i know what they want because they bought a samsung phone you still don't get to
[6452.62 --> 6456.38]  decide what they but they didn't want to compromise on quality in the first place so why would they
[6456.38 --> 6461.66]  want to now maybe their opinion has changed you don't get to decide that their opinion or stance on
[6461.66 --> 6466.78]  things changes phones are also extremely you don't own your users phones are just own your patent
[6466.78 --> 6473.74]  phones are extremely intricate devices they are complex they are difficult to repair and and here's
[6473.74 --> 6479.10]  the thing i don't believe that the difficulty of repair should actually judge anything our entire lives
[6479.10 --> 6487.18]  are essentially tied to our phones we we run off of our phones and so if there is a risk that the user
[6487.18 --> 6494.30]  could thinking that they are getting a samsung part not ultimately get a brand new authentic fully
[6494.30 --> 6499.82]  functioning samsung part they could actually end up in the argument either i don't think there's any
[6499.82 --> 6507.18]  like duping the users about it being a samsung part i would make the argument that the duping does not
[6507.18 --> 6513.66]  necessarily have to be done by the manufacturer of the part i think that is like repair shops as soon as
[6513.66 --> 6520.94]  soon as you make these these janky parts available to budget repair shops i think it is as likely that
[6520.94 --> 6525.98]  these repair shops will pass along the discount as it is that these repair shops will misrepresent the
[6525.98 --> 6533.98]  product as a genuine samsung product that creates a tarnish on the samsung brand when users ultimately start to
[6533.98 --> 6542.94]  perceive samsung as less performant and less reliable okay the other bit and this is this is really important
[6542.94 --> 6548.22]  is that sure you can attack the limited devices that we're providing our self-service repair and our
[6548.22 --> 6556.78]  parts for but i think it's pretty clear that for these older devices it probably doesn't make
[6556.78 --> 6561.98]  economic sense for people to go and repair them anyway given that we have great new phones available
[6561.98 --> 6567.18]  like the a series where you can get i don't think it's up to you to decide what is worth repairing and
[6567.18 --> 6572.22]  not worth but i get to make my argument right i'm also allowed to make counter arguments okay we have a
[6572.22 --> 6577.74]  great so i do believe that if you want to enforce this level of patent that you should make available
[6577.74 --> 6583.34]  all parts needed to repair said phones and i do believe that they should not have to be bundled i
[6583.34 --> 6586.78]  don't think you should have to buy a frame for a phone when you actually just need to replace the
[6586.78 --> 6592.86]  screen sure but here's the issue with that for us to build these products to a standard of quality that
[6592.86 --> 6599.98]  our customers expect it's not economically viable when the reality of it is when we're mass producing them
[6599.98 --> 6606.86]  we can deliver a great quality product like the a series that is functionally not even that much
[6606.86 --> 6611.10]  more expensive than if you were to just buy a display now you've got a brand new device with a
[6611.10 --> 6615.98]  great camera great display as a part of your mass manufacturing you can just create additional
[6615.98 --> 6619.42]  screen brand new battery well we don't have the line spun up for these old phones anymore why would
[6619.42 --> 6625.10]  we we're not making them create more in the first place but we didn't it's fairly it's too late commit
[6625.10 --> 6629.58]  to doing that in the future well we can talk about that in the future but for now we haven't
[6629.58 --> 6634.54]  as for foldable i think as a part if you want to push this bill through are you let me finish no i'm
[6634.54 --> 6640.94]  allowed to make counter arguments i think if you want to push this through we will have to make some
[6640.94 --> 6646.78]  form of agreement that you would over manufacture parts in the future as would be expected from a
[6646.78 --> 6651.82]  company that is going to service warranties anyways by saying that you can fix these phones
[6651.82 --> 6656.86]  into like directly you are saying that you have these parts on hand i'm not saying you can fix the
[6656.86 --> 6661.82]  phones the average user is an idiot and based on that you don't seem to be understanding my argument
[6662.78 --> 6669.10]  i think you might be one of them finally you're saying that you can fix the phones which means
[6669.10 --> 6673.66]  that you have the parts so the argument of not having the part is completely useless but the costs
[6673.66 --> 6678.62]  are high sure but you're saying that you can fix the phone storage costs you have the part right
[6678.62 --> 6682.86]  and and there's training costs so charge the users and we have to build the tools we have to
[6682.86 --> 6686.86]  build the program for this it's going to take time finally actually none of that makes any sense
[6686.86 --> 6690.70]  there's no training cost to train users to fix their own phones oh you have to create you have
[6690.70 --> 6695.66]  to create the program where they are trained to do it absolutely no you don't apple apple did it
[6696.22 --> 6701.02]  don't they charge people for it no but you have to do it it's a it's a fixed cost associated
[6701.02 --> 6706.86]  with running the program you absolutely have to do it a self-repair program just sell it through i fix it
[6706.86 --> 6711.98]  well we are selling parts through i fix it it's just more and in individual components instead of
[6711.98 --> 6716.78]  packages it's going to take time besides you got to understand a lot of the sourcing for the
[6716.78 --> 6723.58]  components of a phone is not done individually like even at the factory okay yeah but you sell a
[6723.58 --> 6727.90]  screen as a component it's going to have the connector cable it's going to have everything else in sure look
[6727.90 --> 6732.38]  you work for this channel linus tech tips or something like that right technically no okay so they did
[6732.38 --> 6741.66]  maybe not anymore i haven't fired luke in a while okay they did a video where they toured the factory
[6741.66 --> 6748.06]  of one of our competitors where you could plainly see that on the factory floor components are actually
[6748.62 --> 6754.78]  coming in as assemblies like we're not gonna we're not gonna take finished assemblies and then break them
[6754.78 --> 6761.58]  apart into their constituent components for these repair programs at the very most you could possibly
[6761.58 --> 6765.66]  expect we would provide the same assemblies that right now we're currently talking about a screen
[6765.66 --> 6770.86]  correct yeah but but a screen so a screen would be one unit at one point in time in that process correct
[6771.58 --> 6777.90]  not necessarily because i mean you got to understand like with global manufacturing that screen factory
[6777.90 --> 6786.38]  that is creating the assemblies that that is not like a shipping endpoint for for this supply chain that
[6786.38 --> 6793.74]  goes to a factory as an assembly you can repair a phone yes if i send you one of my we will use an
[6793.74 --> 6798.78]  assembly we will use an assembly so sell an assembly right so well but i'm only talking about this
[6798.78 --> 6802.62]  because you told me not to sell assemblies i don't think i said anything about an assembly
[6802.62 --> 6808.06]  well let the audience be the judge that includes a frame and whatnot else i don't think is the assembly
[6808.06 --> 6814.06]  that you're describing well it depends that assembly may be very fragile and there could be a high
[6814.06 --> 6817.74]  chance that the user would damage it it's going to have to be handled on a case-by-case basis
[6817.74 --> 6825.50]  no anyway my final point if i can finally make it no is that we're going to have to handle these
[6825.50 --> 6829.90]  things case by case and as for foldables i don't believe you have to handle them case by case okay
[6829.90 --> 6834.38]  i really do need to get this last point out so that we can get through the segment okay as for foldables
[6835.74 --> 6843.42]  we don't need replacement screens a because they are basically functionally impossible to replace
[6843.42 --> 6851.10]  and b they're flexible displays how could you possibly break it there i rest my case manufacturing
[6851.10 --> 6859.34]  defect can you fix a folding phone if a user has an issue with it uh and sends you a folding
[6859.34 --> 6864.38]  phone i'm talking to you i'm samsung the character right now i legitimately don't know okay i actually
[6864.38 --> 6871.42]  don't know if they'd be able to they're quite fused no i know yeah yeah yeah okay well great points
[6871.42 --> 6878.94]  for playing the character of samsung um i was shaking and angry that whole time i hate you so much
[6879.82 --> 6887.74]  yes you did yes you did an excellent job uh embodying samsung and all of the talking points that i can
[6887.74 --> 6895.82]  see them making which are all disgusting and god damn it um oh my cheeks are yeah so you certainly get a
[6895.82 --> 6902.62]  a uh a bunch more points for wow rude yeah well i didn't feel like you were twitter you didn't make
[6902.62 --> 6908.30]  me feel like you were twitter do you know what i mean like um but yeah i don't know the arguments are
[6908.30 --> 6917.10]  are weak and i think i would have preferred to have a take that was why linus would want to protect his
[6917.10 --> 6925.34]  phones like if uh creator warehouse made a phone why you would lock them down with a serial number
[6925.34 --> 6931.50]  and id in the screen i see okay well you got to give me a score you're getting a six i got a six
[6932.62 --> 6940.70]  because i i almost cried oh i would just like to fix things all right what would it take what would it
[6940.70 --> 6948.86]  take to get like a nine well let's see a nine to me would be your points are uh because that was
[6948.86 --> 6953.98]  pretty i felt like he had me on the ropes for a little while there oh yeah no absolutely and then
[6953.98 --> 6958.62]  i i had some some ways to throw back but like what what would he have to do like what would that argument
[6958.62 --> 6965.98]  need to look like to be a nine i think you would probably have to make a good case for it i think it
[6965.98 --> 6970.70]  might be impossible inherently because the segment is called actually i don't know if i ever told
[6970.70 --> 6976.38]  you guys what it's called it's called defend the indefensible oh yeah that's what the version of the
[6976.38 --> 6981.90]  wheel of pain is so you would have to actually actually win dan over yeah i mean not necessarily
[6981.90 --> 6987.66]  as well because i have my own biases i can extremely biased against that entire topic right so for
[6987.66 --> 6992.94]  you there is no nine basically is what i'm trying to get to i don't think there should be if there was
[6992.94 --> 6998.70]  a way and that's fine i just i mean if there was a reason for linus to come up with that would make
[6998.70 --> 7003.34]  sense like i don't know even even locking down the batteries you're not allowed to open your phone
[7003.34 --> 7007.58]  because you're going to destroy the battery and cause a fire you're going to blow down blow up your
[7007.58 --> 7014.70]  house yeah you know liability issues that sort of thing there's no uh eventual argument i think you
[7014.70 --> 7021.34]  could you could find for these topics um and that's yeah yeah i think i think that a well-designed um
[7021.34 --> 7027.42]  defend the indefensible should never have uh should never have a nine out of ten or a ten out of
[7028.30 --> 7033.98]  so basically it comes down to how well you can play the part um i think we absolutely need to set a
[7033.98 --> 7039.66]  time limit for next time or we need to set like a like a clear um like a speaker's baton or whatever
[7040.38 --> 7047.42]  so we can't talk over each other but there's like a clear i state my case you offer your rebuttal i get
[7047.42 --> 7052.94]  to kind of close out my argument and then the judge decides yeah and i think it should take place
[7052.94 --> 7056.06]  over a span of like three to four minutes i think is a pretty good time i think that's a good idea
[7056.06 --> 7062.46]  uh ferna 182 in the float plane chat says a nine should be being so convincing you actually need to
[7062.46 --> 7066.38]  punch the other person in the face i mean i was getting there
[7066.38 --> 7074.46]  you you the the pure patent argument was actually pretty good i think it was
[7075.10 --> 7079.42]  and i think you had to because you have to follow the points that are being made in the like article
[7079.42 --> 7087.02]  or whatever sure but uh once you once you veered off the purely talking about patents then it started
[7087.02 --> 7091.50]  getting pokeable but when it's just a patent it's like oh yeah they do actually well yeah it's like
[7091.50 --> 7098.22]  that's your patent so like no yeah no and i mean i mean okay i i think you could probably poke holes
[7098.22 --> 7104.14]  in that anyway you could attack the broken patent system oh yeah i mean it's atrocious yeah i mean uh
[7104.14 --> 7116.86]  we we became aware of a patent that is basically just like attaching rgb leds to a particular like uh like
[7116.86 --> 7122.86]  product you want to know something i'm sitting here going come on right and the legal process
[7122.86 --> 7128.78]  for it is either you just make your product wait for them to sue you and then counter sue
[7129.66 --> 7135.26]  or you have to like go and try and get their patent invalidated and it's like
[7137.26 --> 7143.02]  okay brutal yeah yeah sorry what were you gonna say the so i don't know if you remember this but
[7143.02 --> 7147.66]  really long time ago there was a game i don't remember what game it was uh but during loading
[7147.66 --> 7153.18]  screens minor vga during loading screens there's like a little mini game that you could play you
[7153.18 --> 7158.70]  know about this yes i do um and there's a patent on mini games during loading screens which like
[7159.42 --> 7162.06]  isn't that important these days because most loading screens are pretty short now
[7162.86 --> 7167.50]  right but back in the day there's some loading screens that were pretty chungus if you were playing
[7167.50 --> 7174.78]  like morrowind on the original xbox it was long that loading screen took forever loading back off
[7174.78 --> 7180.38]  of like dvds and cds and stuff like that used to take a really long time painful so at that point in
[7180.38 --> 7186.14]  time if you could just play like pong yeah like if you're playing a multiplayer game and there's a huge
[7186.14 --> 7190.14]  loading screen you and your buddy can like fight each other in pong or like some other like who cares
[7190.14 --> 7194.22]  little game that'll just keep you interested that would have been way better but some
[7194.22 --> 7201.74]  bandai namco what yeah yeah why they patented and then they were just like nope nobody can do it
[7201.74 --> 7206.78]  you'll have to pay us and then it's not going to be worth it to pay them for anybody because it's just
[7206.78 --> 7212.94]  a minor inconvenience so it's going to buy the game basically decades of people's lives were spent
[7213.50 --> 7218.62]  just staring at loading bars staring at loading bars just why what was the point
[7218.62 --> 7225.74]  ah money please react to sky oblivion yeah i don't oh i mean you were talking about it before the
[7225.74 --> 7230.06]  show started it's not in the doc i'm personally extremely excited um why don't you tell the
[7230.06 --> 7236.30]  people what it is so sky oblivion and let me look it up just to make sure that i say it in the way that
[7236.30 --> 7242.38]  they say it uh sky oblivion is a volunteer-based project by the test renewal modding group test renewal
[7242.38 --> 7252.46]  sure yeah test renewal as far as my understanding goes includes uh sky oblivion and um skywind is it
[7252.46 --> 7259.02]  skywind i think it's skywind which is the uh morrowind in in skyrim engine uh we aim to bring the
[7259.02 --> 7265.18]  elder scrolls 4 oblivion to a new generation of gamers and reintroduce it to long time fans of the
[7265.18 --> 7270.38]  series we are currently in the process of remaking cyrodiil along with all of its quests locations and
[7270.38 --> 7277.34]  characters into skyrim and skyrim special edition so they built oblivion into the skyrim engine that
[7277.34 --> 7283.74]  is wild and they when they make like textures and and everything else that goes into making a game
[7283.74 --> 7289.42]  visually auditorially everything else they made really good quality ones so it looks better than
[7289.42 --> 7296.78]  skyrim did when it launched wow and sky like vanilla skyrim is it's okay it's okay it's dated but
[7296.78 --> 7303.50]  sure it feels old but it doesn't feel old like uh like original runescape or morrowind for example
[7303.50 --> 7308.94]  like it doesn't feel old like that yeah oblivion like i can't tell what that is it's not that kind
[7308.94 --> 7314.38]  of old yeah like is that supposed to be leather or stone yeah you know so it's it's skyrim was like
[7314.38 --> 7319.82]  it's kind of okay it doesn't age as bad as a lot of old games even though it's from or skin tones over
[7319.82 --> 7327.34]  a decade ago yeah um but the the models and stuff that they that they've made um let's talk about
[7327.34 --> 7333.34]  fair use for a second i can show part of the trailer here can i mean this player like you can try
[7334.78 --> 7343.18]  let me bring it up on youtube it's going to show an ad oh my goodness okay skip there we go
[7343.18 --> 7350.86]  let's jump into it like it looks that looks really really good it looks great this is in the skyrim
[7350.86 --> 7356.86]  engine so the controls are going to be pretty good it supports these like high resolution textures
[7357.50 --> 7363.98]  because the skyrim engine does um the marble jaws was moving i'm super excited about this
[7363.98 --> 7372.70]  the announcement is like 2025 or something right but they've been working on this for a really long time
[7373.18 --> 7378.78]  so the fact that it has a date at all is fantastic and what i've heard from at least one member of the
[7378.78 --> 7385.10]  team is that they think that the date is very safe right they think they're going to be done ahead of
[7385.10 --> 7390.46]  the date that they placed but they put it there because they're like we can definitely make this
[7390.46 --> 7393.02]  and that's the right way to approach it does that horse have armor though
[7396.46 --> 7401.66]  there's some armor sitting on top of the horse and yeah you can see like no it no it doesn't look like
[7401.66 --> 7409.82]  a release today new triple a absolute but that's not the point it's not the point it looks amazing
[7410.46 --> 7416.22]  for the fact that it's oblivion it looks amazing even for like really high quality skyrim mods because
[7416.22 --> 7422.06]  this is a really high quality scarab mod which is just the entirety of oblivion and the thing is super
[7422.06 --> 7428.78]  super excited the bar isn't as high for an older game you're just trying to make it digestible for a
[7428.78 --> 7432.54]  modern gamer like i tried to play morrowind when you talked about how much you loved it and this
[7432.54 --> 7437.50]  is even like 10 years ago i just couldn't it's brutal i couldn't get into it yeah and like for
[7437.50 --> 7443.58]  my kids for example you know like i might love final fantasy 6 but between the janky translation and
[7443.58 --> 7447.66]  lack of creature comforts like auto save and stuff like like it's just it's hard for them to get into
[7447.66 --> 7452.46]  it whereas like i'm sitting here going oh yeah pixel remaster even if it's just to kind of share
[7452.46 --> 7457.66]  something that i love with my kids it's probably worth the 25 bucks or whatever it is uh versus
[7457.66 --> 7465.90]  just like you know blowing out a cart and sticking it into uh into a snes and you know it's yeah
[7466.70 --> 7471.90]  just not worth it apparently someone in uh flow plane chat said they they did add horse armor
[7472.94 --> 7479.82]  she's genuinely hilarious um but yeah skywind is the other one i'm obviously like more excited about
[7479.82 --> 7486.38]  skywind because morrowind's my favorite game but oblivion's a i i loved oblivion it's the one elder
[7486.38 --> 7491.82]  scrolls game i've actually played yeah like all the way through tons of side quests like i played the
[7491.82 --> 7497.66]  crap out of oblivion it's a really good game um i wasn't i didn't have a good computer for morrowind and
[7497.66 --> 7507.82]  then i had a lot on my plate for skyrim that makes sense yeah yeah oblivion was a massive step
[7507.82 --> 7514.62]  in like visual fidelity and sure game mechanics that were approachable for people sure um a lot
[7514.62 --> 7519.42]  of what i don't like about the step from morrowind to oblivion is like morrowind had more different
[7519.42 --> 7525.98]  weapon categories and deeper systems in certain ways and like oh yeah but you play tarkov yeah yeah
[7526.86 --> 7534.14]  it's like oh i'm sorry you want to put that bullet in that gun and that weather at that time of day
[7534.14 --> 7538.86]  well 366 ammo fits in a 7.62 mag but it doesn't fit into a 7.62 rifle
[7540.94 --> 7546.78]  anywho yeah so like i i understand but yeah i'm really really excited about this i'm absolutely
[7546.78 --> 7553.18]  going to play it the day it launches um really cool project i do believe they're looking for volunteers
[7553.18 --> 7558.46]  so if you're if you're into whatever they're looking for probably development but i know they
[7558.46 --> 7563.18]  they often look it might be done now i don't know but they often look for like voice actors and
[7563.18 --> 7568.94]  whatever else because they're redoing like a lot of the the voice lines and stuff and as far as i
[7568.94 --> 7574.46]  know they're adding more than what the base game had that's pretty uh so i don't know hopefully i
[7574.46 --> 7578.54]  didn't say anything wrong there but very exciting uh why don't we do a couple of merch messages for
[7578.54 --> 7583.10]  those of you wondering the way to have your message come across the bottom of the screen here maybe get
[7583.10 --> 7589.90]  an answer from dan maybe we'll talk about it on the show is you head over to ltdstore.com and we've got a new
[7589.90 --> 7592.06]  product announcement this week yeah
[7595.98 --> 7601.98]  there's more wait what the crap where's the where's the link to this ah yes here it is
[7603.18 --> 7611.90]  we have a new color of underwear now with this cool like circuit design in yellow black and purple
[7611.90 --> 7619.26]  slash white and blue uh here's all the different styles that we have uh thank you to our wonderful
[7619.26 --> 7624.38]  underwear models who helped us model all the new stuff is he dancing with a skeleton i love it thanks
[7624.38 --> 7631.34]  tyne and that's uh truly wonderful uh i'm having a lively conversation with um my mannequin you know
[7631.34 --> 7637.82]  what i'm matching underwear by the way uh anywho we've got lots of stock of these they just came in
[7637.82 --> 7643.98]  and i mean the reviews are the reviews are in on the ltd underwear it's four net what is i think
[7643.98 --> 7649.26]  four and a half stars or whatever it works out to with over 400 reviews this has been one of our most
[7649.26 --> 7655.66]  successful long-term products uh guys check them out anyway the reason that i'm mentioning this is
[7655.66 --> 7663.90]  because lots of people throw money at like well people who are quite wealthy on the internet and get
[7663.90 --> 7670.38]  basically nothing in return other than maybe being noticed by senpai which i've always found kind of
[7670.38 --> 7677.10]  ridiculous so we created a better system you can send a merch message and that way senpai might notice
[7677.10 --> 7682.70]  you senpai might not but either way you will get some quality merchandise in the mail just check out
[7682.70 --> 7688.06]  the merch messages box in the cart and your merch message will go through to producer dan who will
[7688.62 --> 7693.58]  funnel it into the appropriate place where it might go dan do you want to feed us a couple merch messages
[7693.58 --> 7698.78]  sure i've got one here from james question for luke and linus either one of you ever played runescape
[7698.78 --> 7704.54]  back in the day seems like a lot of people have forgotten about it i never tried it i i definitely
[7704.54 --> 7712.78]  did play um i was very into games like that um what are the other games like that well back then it was
[7712.78 --> 7714.62]  i mean not back then it's an mmo
[7716.70 --> 7723.02]  okay different format it was in your browser all this kind of stuff but it was still an mmo sure um i was i was a
[7723.82 --> 7730.22]  little small child when runescape was first kind of coming around so i have two stories that i think
[7730.22 --> 7736.38]  are funny from back in the runescape days we had net nanny and dial up also known as the internet is
[7736.38 --> 7743.10]  probably slower than most people watching this could actually understand um to the point where i tell this
[7743.10 --> 7748.94]  story and people think i'm exaggerating and i'm not uh i used to load up runescape and then i think
[7748.94 --> 7753.42]  i've told you this before i used to load up runescape and then go downstairs make a sandwich
[7753.42 --> 7759.26]  make some juice eat the sandwich drink the juice go back upstairs and it was usually almost done
[7759.26 --> 7766.38]  loading and i am not exaggerating and i eat really slowly and this is something that i could do
[7766.38 --> 7773.74]  consistently it was impressive to me even when i was a kid that it would complete loading yeah but it would
[7773.74 --> 7780.86]  and then i could actually play the game which was great um but and then the other one is that uh
[7780.86 --> 7789.26]  it's an mmo people talk to each other and in that game speech bubbles right sure so i would walk by and
[7789.26 --> 7793.18]  i would see someone with a speech bubble over their head and i would automatically think they were talking
[7793.18 --> 7797.18]  to me so i used to just run up to anyone that was talking and just respond to anything that they were
[7797.18 --> 7804.30]  saying and one of my friends like watched me play once then was like what are you doing and i was
[7804.30 --> 7808.70]  like what do you mean and they're like they're not talking to you they're talking to the person that's
[7808.70 --> 7813.18]  like standing in front of them or whatever and i'm like oh okay
[7816.78 --> 7824.78]  i mean we've all had our idiotic gaming moments i have some far more recent ones than that oh yeah there
[7824.78 --> 7832.30]  was this vr game that um was like an arena like a like a three-dimensional arena like space like
[7832.30 --> 7840.46]  shooter thing sure um the only way that i the way that i could best describe it is there's this like
[7840.46 --> 7848.22]  uh showdown scene where like the the dark jedi student fights one of the good ones in the um in the
[7848.22 --> 7853.34]  young jedi knight series of like expanded universe novels where they're in it's basically like this dome
[7853.90 --> 7861.10]  cage match zero gravity thing uh so anyway it was like kind of like that um which is going to be
[7861.10 --> 7866.30]  pretty pretty obscure way of describing it i actually can picture it perfectly though yeah but like but for
[7866.30 --> 7871.82]  most the scene with zek and he fight has to fight like jayna or whatever it is i don't remember anyway
[7871.82 --> 7880.54]  the point is like a lot better than the sequel trilogy anyway um it was basically that and i didn't realize
[7880.54 --> 7886.14]  as i was like sitting there like just talking to myself about like my frustrations and like
[7886.14 --> 7890.86]  chatting with you that the mic that the mic in this game is just like automatically open and i've got
[7890.86 --> 7895.50]  these like 11 year olds screeching in my ear i can't figure out how to turn it off i'm sitting there
[7895.50 --> 7902.46]  going how do i turn this off how do i turn this off it was it was definitely uh an old man moment for me
[7902.46 --> 7909.50]  that's pretty funny yeah um all right dan hit me okay this one's from nathan thoughts on account
[7909.50 --> 7915.66]  locked phones becoming largely e-waste fell into the trap of unknowingly buying a locked phone on ebay
[7915.66 --> 7920.70]  and apple would not take the phone or assist in any way they can be used for parts but it would be nice
[7920.70 --> 7926.06]  if they were reusable account locked phones what do you mean yeah icloud locked phones that sort of thing
[7926.06 --> 7932.46]  uh they're basically use apple yeah they're basically internet factory hardware locked and you can't
[7933.10 --> 7940.38]  get past them very easily at all honestly i fully support it i know controversial take but
[7941.50 --> 7948.78]  password like hardware encrypted devices wouldn't this with the store with the nand with like with the
[7948.78 --> 7954.54]  storage whether through the nand or through the controller with the storage essentially permanently bound
[7954.54 --> 7960.94]  to the board basically eliminated phone theft i was just going to say wouldn't this dissuade phone
[7960.94 --> 7966.94]  theft yeah and to be clear phone theft is not eliminated and there are workarounds you you you can
[7966.94 --> 7975.58]  de-solder component but it it significantly could be incentivized phone theft and phone theft was a huge
[7975.58 --> 7983.26]  problem in the early to mid knots if you if you were able to get into the phone could you release your
[7983.26 --> 7989.50]  account from it yeah yeah then i don't think that's a problem yeah so it's but but well it is a problem
[7989.50 --> 7998.14]  because we run into careless users donating phones and not unlocking them or even careless organizations
[7998.78 --> 8005.50]  basically saying yeah um these are all managed by our organization we wish for these to be destroyed
[8005.50 --> 8011.18]  because we have whatever irrational concerns about data theft or whatever from our school or whatever
[8011.18 --> 8017.26]  stupid thing like what like what what's what's now okay i shouldn't say that there are valid reasons
[8017.26 --> 8024.22]  why i school my blah blah student grades etc etc but the point is they can be wiped it's fine chill um
[8025.82 --> 8030.38]  so where they basically dictate no these these ipads need to be destroyed because someone might
[8030.94 --> 8034.94]  you know find out our typing tutor scores or whatever take away i i don't think they should
[8034.94 --> 8043.42]  take that feature away just because there's like negligent use no but like we do need a solution though
[8044.30 --> 8053.02]  right and the only you know the only really viable solution is a back door and a back door is automatically
[8053.74 --> 8059.10]  a back door is a door if you have the key someone else has the key exactly and so i yeah it's it's one of
[8059.10 --> 8064.38]  those really tough ones right like i've i've said before on this show um anyone who claims that the
[8064.38 --> 8072.38]  solution is simple uh to a problem that has not been solved yet is either a a liar or an idiot right
[8072.38 --> 8080.46]  all i'm saying here is that i think the solution is worth it like i i think phones should be hard locked
[8080.46 --> 8087.18]  yeah oh no no i meant the solution to the sea waste problem oh yeah yeah and and i just i yeah no i i
[8087.18 --> 8097.02]  fully support working device encryption uh whether it's phones or laptops computers um portable ones
[8097.02 --> 8105.98]  not portable ones are no longer such a huge target for theft and it it's it's in my
[8108.06 --> 8115.90]  my take whether i can defend it or not um is i think it's better this way yeah me yeah me too and you
[8115.90 --> 8122.70]  know what me too that's one thing that i do agree with but let me into the bootloader when i own the
[8122.70 --> 8127.58]  phone yeah i mean you want another one you're gonna move on you won't get any argument from us there no
[8127.58 --> 8132.78]  yeah you know what i want to i want to do a not merch message one real quick here this is from dark 24
[8132.78 --> 8137.82]  over in the float plane chat uh i don't like merch messages to me it's too convoluted to try and get a
[8137.82 --> 8143.02]  message to wanshow it needs to be as easy as it is on youtube plus i get you think it's better for
[8143.02 --> 8148.30]  the user but users don't necessarily care that youtube gets a split where our ltt does not want
[8148.30 --> 8153.02]  youtube to get that cut so it's a couple of things um number one is yeah yeah it's more convoluted we
[8153.02 --> 8157.18]  had to build the tool ourselves uh because merch messages wasn't working properly still isn't working
[8157.18 --> 8165.90]  properly or super chats wasn't working properly uh back to my screen sharing still isn't working properly
[8165.90 --> 8173.02]  literally none the entire show i doubt it oh my god stop uh usually when i show you guys this there's
[8173.02 --> 8177.10]  like one here because people don't get the message and they send it through here and i'm like okay i
[8177.10 --> 8180.38]  mean if you really want to by all means i'm not going to turn it off like if you just want to throw money
[8180.38 --> 8187.90]  at the screen that that's i mean that's your right i guess um so yeah it's convoluted we had to we had to
[8187.90 --> 8196.54]  build it but it's also not about being um it's a part of it is yeah i don't think you should youtube
[8196.54 --> 8201.42]  should get a split for building features that don't work properly no no i i actually don't think
[8201.42 --> 8207.82]  they do and we can disagree on that um we've had a lot of cases where you need to refresh the page or
[8208.70 --> 8213.82]  something whatever happens you lose that tab and they go away now historically all of them are gone and
[8213.82 --> 8218.54]  that's a huge friction that that's a bad user experience i don't really think that's debatable
[8218.54 --> 8226.38]  um and then as for as for i get you think it is better for the user again i don't really i don't
[8226.38 --> 8235.34]  really think that's debatable it it it is everything that uh you know whatever bits or whatever other thing
[8235.34 --> 8241.10]  is it is a way of interacting with the show you know you can have a little thing come up or whatever
[8241.10 --> 8248.14]  um and if you don't want the thing in the mail you can just buy a gift card like if you just want to
[8248.14 --> 8253.58]  throw money at the screen then like i guess you can do that we we have gift cards um and i mean
[8254.22 --> 8262.54]  i'm about to i'm about to have a super hot take here um i i had someone criticize us for the lowest
[8262.54 --> 8268.14]  the lowest barrier of entry for merch messages being the ten dollar gift card because that's the lowest value
[8268.14 --> 8273.50]  of gift card card on ltt store and i i had typed up the thing i decided not to send it but i guess
[8273.50 --> 8279.10]  i'm going to say it now live on the show is that ten dollar threshold shouldn't be a problem if you
[8279.10 --> 8283.02]  don't have ten dollars of disposable income you should not be throwing it at me don't do a merge
[8283.02 --> 8290.06]  message yeah yeah plain and simple um if you happen to need something and we have a high quality version
[8290.06 --> 8294.94]  of that thing you happen to need by all means send in a merge message but if ten dollars is if money is
[8294.94 --> 8300.06]  that tight for you that that you need it to be five dollars instead of ten dollars we don't want it
[8300.06 --> 8300.78]  i don't want it
[8304.70 --> 8310.94]  yep all right uh dan hit me with one more and then we'll do a couple more topics and then we'll go
[8310.94 --> 8315.66]  into more of the like merch message q a towards the end of the show oh yeah sure um on the same
[8315.66 --> 8321.90]  sort of vein of our uh high quality products what is your process of selecting a supplier for a new or
[8321.90 --> 8329.42]  existing lttstore.com merch oh yeah sure i mean well one of the there's a lot of different ways you can
[8329.42 --> 8336.46]  kind of tackle it so uh with the backpack for example uh we are not working we are okay we are
[8337.42 --> 8343.02]  we can communicate directly with the actual manufacturer but we are working through a firm that
[8343.58 --> 8350.62]  facilitates uh these kinds of products um so they have their own kind of like factory network and they
[8350.62 --> 8356.94]  helped us out a lot with the durability uh material selection like we were not um
[8358.78 --> 8363.42]  i don't know i don't know whatever the whatever the way of using the word hubris is to to describe
[8363.42 --> 8371.26]  this we're we're not egotistical enough to think that somehow we can just walk into a completely new
[8371.26 --> 8377.18]  uh product category and imagine that we're somehow going to absolutely nail it on the first try
[8377.18 --> 8384.70]  without some help so we we worked through um a third party firm um so in that case it was you know
[8384.70 --> 8389.34]  we found someone who had the relationships and had the capabilities to help us bring it to market
[8389.98 --> 8397.66]  in the case of the screwdriver for example it was um pretty similar but then ended up being different
[8397.66 --> 8404.78]  because of the way that the relationship between our partner and their factory broke down during the
[8404.78 --> 8409.66]  process which we outlined in more detail in the video on the making of the screwdriver um in the
[8409.66 --> 8416.22]  case of something like water bottles um you know we were we kind of reached out to pretty much every
[8416.22 --> 8424.06]  water bottle manufacturer we could find uh until we we laid out our specs so it's kind of like an odm job
[8424.06 --> 8431.02]  so do you know the difference between oem and odm no i've actually never heard of odm oh okay so uh oem
[8431.02 --> 8438.70]  or original equipment manufacturer is basically where a factory builds a product for someone else to
[8439.26 --> 8448.70]  slap their label on and sell that is an oem product an odm product is where you go to the manufacturer
[8448.70 --> 8456.22]  who makes said products and you go okay what you have is pretty okay but here are my specs and we need
[8456.22 --> 8463.50]  you to build it to this standard okay um so the vast vast majority of what is on lttstore.com would be
[8463.50 --> 8470.06]  odm uh work from the manufacturers product you wanted some changes to it yeah so like plushies for
[8470.06 --> 8477.90]  example they make plushies they don't make a linus shaped one that makes sense obviously right why would
[8477.90 --> 8484.62]  they yeah like you're not yeah yeah that makes sense so you didn't you didn't just rebadge a product
[8484.62 --> 8489.98]  no but you also didn't make a new manufacturing facility for a product no you worked with
[8489.98 --> 8493.98]  manufacturing facility to make similar things and just got them to adapt it to what you want yeah
[8493.98 --> 8498.86]  and a lot of the times um you know it's it's not everything comes from under one roof right right like
[8498.86 --> 8505.02]  even something as simple as a pair of underwear right there's they're gonna have to bring in elastics
[8505.02 --> 8512.86]  from somewhere else uh getting this um uh this plastic free packaging yeah uh involved finding
[8512.86 --> 8517.66]  a source for plastic free packaging that will also keep it safe and shipping etc etc like we're trying
[8517.66 --> 8524.46]  to move completely away from plastic in our packaging um so what i'm trying to say is that
[8524.46 --> 8531.42]  when everything you're building is custom um you know even down to the even down to the composition
[8531.42 --> 8541.26]  of this the um uh the i don't want to get it wrong and our first generation labels are really bad
[8541.26 --> 8544.78]  uh that's something we're improving so i actually can't read it so you know what it doesn't matter the
[8544.78 --> 8553.66]  point is the the fiber blend of like our custom shirts was a painstaking process that's why it takes us so long
[8553.66 --> 8563.34]  all right why don't we do a couple more topics here all right oh there's an ltx 2023 update uh we have
[8563.34 --> 8573.02]  an faq now we have safety policies um do we have do we have a contact we don't yet have a date that
[8573.02 --> 8579.34]  we're going to be reaching out to ltx 2020 vip ticket holders but they are saying very soon
[8579.34 --> 8588.86]  uh ask us questions via the form on the faq page or by emailing info at ltx expo.com there you go
[8588.86 --> 8594.14]  all right so we have uh we have support now which is pretty cool uh maybe don't everyone message
[8594.14 --> 8599.18]  support your question at once maybe assume someone else will do it and it'll be added to the faq sometime
[8599.18 --> 8604.94]  in the next week or two uh we do not have a team of eight people working on support for ltx at this
[8604.94 --> 8610.54]  time given that the expo is still like almost six months out uh we do have expo sponsors and
[8610.54 --> 8619.82]  partners that we can share publicly so corsair the gaming stadium kanto memory express msi nzxt
[8620.46 --> 8631.02]  csonic and secret lab those guys cool if there are partners who want to exhibit or work with us reach out to
[8631.02 --> 8637.58]  partner at ltx expo.com heck yeah all right
[8639.90 --> 8646.70]  oh i need to talk about the new angel investment disclosure so i had talked recently about how
[8646.70 --> 8652.62]  there was a nas product that i was really excited about the future of um i have a couple more things
[8652.62 --> 8659.98]  to share uh so first of all is that based on you guys being overwhelmingly supportive of it i i really
[8659.98 --> 8665.82]  don't think that i've allowed the float plane sponsorship to affect our content in any meaningful
[8665.82 --> 8672.30]  way uh i obviously daily drive a float plane laptop i obviously want them to succeed but um
[8674.22 --> 8680.94]  okay i mean hit me i just didn't know we were making laptops we are video players the video
[8680.94 --> 8687.34]  website is hard enough no no no no no no i'm not making laptops no i invested in flow uh oh
[8690.30 --> 8695.58]  it's a big endeavor if you want me to do it man i'll figure it out i'm just saying it's hard and we
[8695.58 --> 8700.46]  already do a lot of hard stuff framework apparently i can't even remember what company i'm invested in
[8700.46 --> 8704.94]  so i got i mean i'm invested in that one too so it's all kind of the same to me yeah yeah um
[8704.94 --> 8713.34]  um anywho yeah i don't i i i sincerely do not believe i have allowed it to affect my laptop
[8713.34 --> 8721.34]  coverage frankly most days i don't think of it at all even when i am sitting down like evaluating a
[8721.34 --> 8726.54]  laptop i don't i don't necessarily remember unless i look at the laptop and i go wow that seems like
[8726.54 --> 8732.78]  really anti-consumer or really anti-right to repair i wish it was more like framework who i'm invested in
[8732.78 --> 8740.06]  right like that it's kind of an afterthought for me yeah um but this one i think is even more cut
[8740.06 --> 8745.82]  and dried just because it's a category of product that we don't really cover to the same degree so
[8745.82 --> 8754.38]  it's nas software and um the bottom line is that enterprise nas solutions yeah they have their place
[8755.18 --> 8759.90]  but current operating systems tend to assume that the person managing and configuring the server is
[8759.90 --> 8767.82]  an it expert and not like enthusiast who's like into it but someone who actually like has some
[8767.82 --> 8773.90]  training or has done extensive research um they can be frustrating and inaccessible to small creators
[8773.90 --> 8780.30]  uh consumers prosumers and enthusiasts so the goal with this project is to design an intuitive and
[8780.30 --> 8787.02]  accessible home server solution for all users uh the new company has they describe themselves as an
[8787.02 --> 8793.50]  impressive team i love you guys they have a team for sure um i'll i i look forward to being impressed
[8793.50 --> 8798.38]  you call your team world class i do my team is world class sometimes they even get the pee in the
[8798.38 --> 8804.54]  toilet without getting it on the seat i consider that to be quite world class a bit of an inside joke
[8805.42 --> 8811.26]  anywho uh you know what fine i'll bite the new company has an impressive team headed by two long time
[8811.26 --> 8816.30]  tech veterans who recently completed an eight-year stint at unraid where they were responsible for
[8816.30 --> 8822.22]  modernization in the form of implementing docker and virtual machines gpu pass-through and rebranding
[8822.22 --> 8827.90]  and marketing respectively we're not going to get too far into the weeds for now but i am officially
[8827.90 --> 8833.58]  their angel investor and uh you can expect some updates in the future i'm actually excited for this
[8834.30 --> 8841.02]  yeah i'm really excited have you ever met those guys no oh okay yeah cool all right well okay
[8841.26 --> 8849.18]  the video call okay yeah like way back in the day they're they're cool enough that um i don't even
[8849.18 --> 8857.66]  have a proper legal document for my shares and they already have the check so either i just got ripped
[8857.66 --> 8865.58]  super hard it'll be pretty epic or um or these guys are super chill and and i'm right about that and
[8865.58 --> 8870.62]  this is going to be awesome there really is no middle ground here i think
[8873.26 --> 8881.82]  oh no yeah cool uh what else we got to talk about today oh oh oh thank goodness there's a new home pod
[8883.98 --> 8889.50]  now with temperature and humidity sensors for smart home i thought they were done with these i thought so
[8889.50 --> 8896.54]  too but no it's a second gen home pod it's 50 less than the first gen starting price at 300 us dollars
[8897.18 --> 8904.62]  it has fewer tweeters and fewer mics which is cool but it adds uwb and thread so you can so it has like
[8904.62 --> 8911.50]  that um that like location location chip which uh could be actually really neat like if you had home pods
[8911.50 --> 8916.86]  all over your house because you're a mega baller and then you have your iphone it could like know where you
[8916.86 --> 8921.82]  are and like play music you're farther away it could like make it louder or something i don't
[8921.82 --> 8927.02]  know that they'll ever implement anything like that but theoretically they could um the home pod mini
[8927.02 --> 8933.66]  also secretly included the humidity and temperature sensors so it will be updated to activate them so
[8933.66 --> 8939.02]  that's cool adding features to a smart home product instead of removing them i mean i guess i support this
[8939.02 --> 8947.02]  i'm not that into um hidden sensors and things that are not disclosed yeah i mean you know
[8950.70 --> 8951.82]  dan just leaves
[8954.38 --> 8958.70]  he's gone he walked right off i mean if he's anything like me he probably has to go pee pee at this point
[8958.70 --> 8963.34]  because we've been on the show for quite a while it has been a long time um anyway there's some also
[8963.34 --> 8970.46]  other more different new apple products um there's m2 pro and max and they're faster and there's like
[8970.46 --> 8974.14]  some macbooks and some mac minis that have those in them i guess that's pretty cool this is a pretty
[8974.14 --> 8979.34]  quiet announcement i think we got our hands on a couple of them i don't even know if we're going
[8979.34 --> 8985.90]  to cover these things on ltt though we we just we tend to be so late on them that by the time we cover
[8985.90 --> 8990.54]  them the the conversation's sort of over so we'll probably just hit them on short circuit yeah sorry it's
[8990.54 --> 8994.22]  lower quality content but you guys don't want the in-depth stuff apparently because you don't watch
[8994.22 --> 8999.98]  it so i guess whatever um and then uh we'll definitely cover them on mac address eventually
[8999.98 --> 9005.26]  um you know they'll they'll get around to it and then in the future once the lab is all set up we'll
[9005.26 --> 9009.90]  be able to like really pump this stuff out but in the meantime i just don't think it's feasible on ltt
[9009.90 --> 9017.74]  we've got too much else going on in other apple news apple tv requires a separate apple device
[9017.74 --> 9026.14]  to accept the terms of service this week twitter user at huge lg up posted a picture of their apple tv
[9026.14 --> 9031.90]  which was inoperable because it required the user to accept the terms and conditions agreement
[9031.90 --> 9041.74]  on a separate device using an up-to-date copy of ios i have talked extensively about this kind of
[9041.74 --> 9052.22]  jerry from apple oh i'm sorry you haven't purchased enough of our products well i hope you don't expect
[9052.22 --> 9058.62]  the ones you did buy to function haha maybe next time you should be more rich i was i was actually
[9058.62 --> 9064.94]  hoping this was going to come up from the wheel um because i was i was really interested how this was
[9064.94 --> 9071.18]  gonna go someone had to try to defend this every time it was spanned by either of us i was just
[9071.18 --> 9078.22]  gonna go straight after poor people that was my plan i was gonna be like well they should get more money
[9078.22 --> 9089.02]  then that's a 10. that's a 10. that's a 10. and boom now we know um i mean i've talked about this so much
[9089.02 --> 9097.98]  in the past as a daily driver user of one exactly one apple product the airpods pro twos or are they
[9097.98 --> 9102.78]  called pro i don't remember whatever the second gen airpods pros i can't keep track of their naming
[9102.78 --> 9108.30]  crap i am also a user of one and exactly one apple product and it is the first gen just straight up
[9108.30 --> 9116.06]  airpods so as a user of one apple product i have found myself extremely frustrated at the way that i
[9116.06 --> 9123.74]  am treated i am treated as a second class citizen there is no there is literally no way for me to
[9123.74 --> 9128.14]  update the firmware of my product in the case of the first gen airpods that was apparently a bit of
[9128.14 --> 9133.66]  a bullet dodge um given that they nerfed the active noise cancellation but in the case of the second gen
[9133.66 --> 9138.62]  airpods i haven't seen any reason to believe that that would be a benefit and the fact that there is
[9138.62 --> 9145.58]  no way to plug that device because they don't explicitly say that it is not supported on android or windows
[9145.58 --> 9154.46]  devices and it does in fact work just fine okay so then would you consider not providing firmware
[9154.46 --> 9162.22]  updates to be supported i don't know i don't know seems pretty bs to me um and the so the only way to
[9162.22 --> 9169.58]  update your firmware is to be paired to an app to an iphone to have it nearby and to have them both be
[9169.58 --> 9175.58]  charging and sleeping essentially and then it will just happen automagically that's not an acceptable
[9175.58 --> 9181.10]  answer and i mean apple knew that once upon a time back in the days of the ipod they built itunes for
[9181.10 --> 9186.62]  windows because they understood when you bought an ipod you expect king ipod
[9190.06 --> 9196.78]  yep um someone in flow plane chat said that they're an apple employee and that this is a bug but i don't
[9196.78 --> 9205.58]  believe them i believe them um i just don't believe that it's a high priority bug i think that if
[9205.58 --> 9211.50]  there's no public confirmation it's not a priority bug yeah i don't know man i think that this this is
[9211.50 --> 9217.58]  one of those this is also one of those bugs that comes about from tunnel vision like this this this
[9217.58 --> 9223.26]  is a bug that exists because that's not a bug that would be a lack of a feature because the no no i mean
[9223.26 --> 9228.86]  the product is developed in an environment where there's an assumption there's it's kind of like
[9228.86 --> 9240.54]  okay i had a really awkward encounter in a bathroom once oh my okay wow i go a bunch of ways i i this
[9240.54 --> 9249.26]  this man was um at the sink to wash his hands in the bathroom and he got all soaped up and put his hands
[9249.26 --> 9256.30]  under the sink and like it didn't come on and he was like trying to figure out if there was like a
[9256.30 --> 9264.86]  manual button somewhere he's like getting right up to it and um he goes yeah he kind of turns to me
[9264.86 --> 9269.18]  goes bro it must be broken or something along those lines and he kind of like is on his way walking out
[9269.18 --> 9274.70]  and i go oh man i don't know i put my hands under the sink it immediately works why
[9274.70 --> 9286.86]  it's skin color yeah yikes because he was black yeah and i'm looking at it going that's brutal that's
[9286.86 --> 9297.98]  a bug oh yeah but a bad bug yep that's not like oops that's like we literally only ever considered
[9298.54 --> 9306.78]  that white skin might go under this sensor that's brutal big yikes right and honestly i see a lot of
[9306.78 --> 9313.50]  this in apple's product development is they just have these complete and utter to the point where it
[9313.50 --> 9319.02]  has to be intentional blind spots yeah yeah i'm what doesn't everyone have an iphone
[9321.02 --> 9327.10]  so this this this screen would have come up and remember this is a big company right like it's not
[9327.10 --> 9333.42]  like one person you know worked on the the updater or like the terms and conditions update pro flow for
[9333.42 --> 9340.14]  this right so this would have this would have come up for for many people at some point and they all
[9340.14 --> 9346.94]  would have gone oh okay so i can use my iphone for this and no one at any point thought what if i don't
[9346.94 --> 9354.70]  have an iphone that's what happened so yeah it's a bug yeah it's probably an accident but you still suck
[9354.70 --> 9362.46]  yeah like that doesn't that doesn't make it better obviously this is not as bad as that sensor right
[9364.54 --> 9371.74]  but it also is really bad because what if your reason for not being able to have an iphone is your
[9371.74 --> 9378.46]  socioeconomic position what if you got an apple tv as a gift and this is just a giant fu for not being
[9378.46 --> 9389.50]  able to afford more that's not cool either right so yeah not cool not cool not even a little um yeah
[9389.50 --> 9398.14]  maybe that's why tim cut tim cook's uh salary got cut could be it um anywho i think that was kind of
[9398.14 --> 9404.14]  all there was to say about that uh oh alex has a note in here though i really hate that with apple tv plus
[9404.14 --> 9408.14]  the service not the device uh the video quality settings are horrific unless you're watching on
[9408.14 --> 9412.22]  an apple device yeah yeah like that's the kind of thing man like why is that necessary yeah back when
[9412.22 --> 9417.02]  apple used to make their keynotes only watchable on apple devices until after it's like what you don't
[9417.02 --> 9425.18]  want to sell to people who don't already have one what like what kind of next level living up inside
[9425.18 --> 9432.54]  your own rectum universe do you exist in like what is your problem you know like it's not even it's not
[9432.54 --> 9442.22]  even that they're outside of their their rights to do that they can but they're that's just this whole
[9442.22 --> 9450.46]  thing to do like just why ew yeah why would i why would i buy anything from you why would i even talk to
[9450.46 --> 9461.42]  you you know anyway speaking of crazy things to do or alternative things to do wyoming plans to phase out
[9461.42 --> 9468.46]  evs weird lots of other places are planning to phase out gas powered vehicles the wyoming
[9468.46 --> 9476.62]  legislature passed a resolution to eliminate all sales of new evs by 2035 legislators justified this
[9476.62 --> 9482.06]  move based on potential pollution from battery waste ending up in landfills and the importance of
[9482.78 --> 9489.98]  wyoming's oil and gas sector beyond that they say that wyoming is simply too empty and underpopulated to
[9489.98 --> 9498.14]  ever need evs because there is only limited ev infrastructure consumers should be banned from
[9498.14 --> 9500.70]  buying them state senator brian
[9503.66 --> 9514.14]  bonner good good nice recovery good save brian bonner the bill's sponsor describes it as tongue-in-cheek but a
[9514.14 --> 9524.14]  serious issue that deserves discussion okay well it's still a bill the the bill is purely symbolic and
[9524.14 --> 9525.74]  has no effect on the legal status of
[9528.14 --> 9533.90]  i'm genuinely confused it's it's pretty much just a way of um
[9533.90 --> 9543.58]  i'm gonna say um if it bans it's a resolution though okay not a law so it's like so it's kind of
[9543.58 --> 9550.06]  it's kind of like when when a country like uh creates a resolution that they will you know reduce
[9550.06 --> 9556.86]  climate change by x amount it's a goal it's a it's a new year's resolution it's yes got it nothing will
[9556.86 --> 9566.14]  happen nothing will change yeah okay um it was mostly included because it was one of our topics for
[9566.14 --> 9571.66]  defending the indefensible god um i don't know you know what this is another thing that i've had some
[9571.66 --> 9578.22]  really good sort of conversations with ivan about where she kind of goes um you know for her um
[9578.22 --> 9586.30]  um i really like her sort of analysis of how polarization has gotten out of hand because it's
[9586.30 --> 9592.78]  a behavior that she's noticed in herself and in me over the years uh when we will when we'll argue
[9592.78 --> 9598.70]  you know when we are when we are legitimately taking up two different sides of an issue and she says yeah
[9598.70 --> 9605.18]  you know what i have a tendency to do is when i feel like the other side of the argument has gone
[9605.18 --> 9613.26]  so far away from the truth which often lies somewhere in the middle is that i feel like i
[9613.26 --> 9618.94]  need to compensate you know it's kind of like how if you've got uh if you've got a parent who's
[9618.94 --> 9625.82]  super uh you know angry all the time and and abusive the other one might feel pressure to try to make up
[9625.82 --> 9631.74]  for it whereas if both took a more balanced approach that might actually be healthier for the child and in
[9631.74 --> 9641.58]  the same way if if two sides of an issue were to um attempt to see eye to eye on it rather than uh be
[9641.58 --> 9649.82]  sort of lured into these farther and farther extreme uh positions we might have a chance of actually having
[9649.82 --> 9657.18]  a constructive conversation because the reality of it is that the upcoming avalanche of battery e-waste
[9657.18 --> 9663.58]  is a legitimate problem and how we harvest the minerals required to manufacture them is also like
[9663.58 --> 9669.74]  and where they're coming from yeah is a is a super not okay is a legitimate problem yeah the defense of
[9669.74 --> 9679.98]  the oil and gas sector is absolutely not a a defensible um reason for bringing it up yeah they're
[9679.98 --> 9686.06]  deplorable too and like just because you don't like parts of one thing doesn't mean that you need to be 100
[9686.06 --> 9690.54]  aligned with everything on the other side and yada yada yeah
[9693.18 --> 9699.10]  so that's um that's all i have to say about that huge problem we used to actually talk about this on
[9699.10 --> 9706.06]  wanshow fairly often because i think probably around two years ago it felt like every few months we'd hear
[9706.06 --> 9711.42]  some rumor about a new battery technology do you remember this yeah i mean they're still coming i mean
[9711.42 --> 9716.62]  my google news feed is full of them yeah yeah all the time yeah this this one's gonna get a thousand
[9716.62 --> 9720.86]  miles and blah blah blah and it'll be perfectly recyclable yeah where is it the main thing we need is
[9720.86 --> 9726.86]  just something that doesn't require the same materials like that's the the materials required for current
[9726.86 --> 9733.10]  high-end batteries is like very problematic what current high-end battery okay nevermind i know that's
[9733.10 --> 9738.78]  such a pretty good okay um but yeah i don't that's that's a it's a huge problem i mean that's a big
[9738.78 --> 9745.74]  part of the argument for hydrogen fuel cells right is that they're supposed to be um well essentially
[9745.74 --> 9753.42]  they're supposed to just run on why i i fed that energy blah blah etc i know i get it um but we can't
[9753.42 --> 9758.46]  we can't reach an optimal solution if we aren't willing to at least consider the concerns of the other
[9758.46 --> 9766.86]  party yeah now that's not to say that every concern from the other party is valid also fair um
[9767.98 --> 9774.78]  and that that makes it very challenging maybe that makes it very challenging right yeah um what is valid
[9774.78 --> 9782.14]  is uh google's move to make the stadia controller usable not so dead yeah after after stadia goes the
[9782.14 --> 9787.74]  way of the dodo uh they released a self-service tool to enable bluetooth on stadia controllers probably
[9787.74 --> 9792.06]  should have just supported in the first place but hey cool um bluetooth must be enabled before
[9792.06 --> 9804.38]  december 31st 2023 that's weird uh why oh okay um while stadia was compatible with most third-party
[9804.38 --> 9808.38]  controllers the rationale for the stadia controller was that it could connect directly to google servers
[9808.38 --> 9813.34]  via wi-fi reducing latency super cool uh but it won't do that anymore it'll just be bluetooth which is i
[9813.34 --> 9821.26]  guess also fine i think uh we can kind of switch over to some merch messages here should we do that yeah
[9822.78 --> 9830.38]  all right let's get into it uh i've got one here oh i don't know that we've already done okay uh this
[9830.38 --> 9837.74]  one's from austin hey i just wanted to austin texas the the whole state uh hey i just wanted to bring up
[9837.74 --> 9843.34]  that i'm currently working at a fiber to home isp that is bringing 10 gig to residential in california
[9843.34 --> 9848.86]  at a reasonable price some of my co-workers claim that it's not necessary uh what are your thoughts
[9848.86 --> 9856.46]  it's not necessary yeah yeah well i want it what the heck are you going to do with it have it what are
[9856.46 --> 9865.50]  you going to connect what are you going to connect to i just want it like i actually no i actually think
[9865.50 --> 9871.34]  this should have been on the defend the indefensible wheel because it is an indefensible position to say
[9871.34 --> 9877.98]  that you could need 10 gig internet at home today your poorly secured iot device can just like ddos
[9877.98 --> 9883.66]  the world i mean honestly though um like you could okay let's let's go through the arguments right so
[9883.66 --> 9889.02]  that you could um have lots of people there well realistically you probably live in a single family
[9889.02 --> 9895.02]  dwelling you said it's residential so no no actually the the number might not be lots of
[9895.02 --> 9899.90]  or it might be lots of people but it's not going to be like the vast majority of the office building
[9899.90 --> 9906.62]  the vast majority of the services that you connect to a will not even have one gigabit of available
[9906.62 --> 9914.62]  uplink bandwidth to you yeah and b especially for things like web browsing are more likely to be limited
[9914.62 --> 9921.66]  by like dns lookups what then by the actual transfer speed okay number three let's say you sail the
[9921.66 --> 9930.62]  high seas hard okay at that speed crashing waves you are going to be spending you will not be able to
[9930.62 --> 9937.74]  work enough hours to afford the hard drives that you are going to need to contain all this data
[9937.74 --> 9944.70]  everyone so far that's saying that they want it says just because no one has a reason
[9945.74 --> 9950.78]  well i get it because when we got a 10 gig connection here that was why i did it yeah i mean it's sick
[9950.78 --> 9957.26]  but like yes it's completely okay but we have a hundred people here now so yeah we might actually use
[9957.26 --> 9964.78]  a lot of it yeah um yeah the the the the thing was claims that it's not necessary of course it's not
[9964.78 --> 9971.58]  necessary yeah yeah just put it in anyway sorry are you guys actually opposed to being tech forward
[9971.58 --> 9979.02]  right now this is a prime i'm sorry this is the i like waffles then you hate pancakes argument that is
[9979.02 --> 9986.54]  stupid that is not what we said we said it's not necessary yes luke and linus hate the internet and
[9986.54 --> 9994.54]  oh i'm not saying don't lay the fiber all we were saying is not necessary by all means let's let's
[9994.54 --> 10000.38]  get ready yeah let's do it yeah eventually we'll be able to you know what stream 3d model files
[10000.94 --> 10008.06]  into whatever who knows i don't know hot take yeah hot take we will never need a 10 gigabit home
[10009.02 --> 10015.34]  internet it's a bad take why would i didn't say it was bad i said it was hot okay it's hot because okay
[10015.34 --> 10018.94]  can i can i the amount of water are you gonna give me a chance to put it out is not very much
[10018.94 --> 10024.78]  are you gonna give me a chance we need to have our timed segments okay can i talk sure all right okay
[10027.26 --> 10030.30]  what are the primary drivers of bandwidth consumption now
[10034.14 --> 10041.74]  video yeah i mean yes right this guy knows look at his shirt um yeah primary driver of bandwidth okay
[10041.74 --> 10053.50]  it's like netflix and stuff right now we are at 4k right 3d coming back probably not okay we're at 4k
[10053.50 --> 10060.86]  we are at color depths that while not um uh we're at dynamic ranges and color depths that are not uh
[10060.86 --> 10065.26]  maxing out the capabilities of the eye but we're starting to talk about the capabilities of the eye
[10065.26 --> 10077.66]  the eye fair enough okay sure okay for resolution right we could go further but at what is considered
[10077.66 --> 10085.90]  to be and even going back to like you know the the early days of of projection theaters at what is what
[10085.90 --> 10094.78]  is uh a ratio of your field of vision uh at at what is a ratio of your field of vision that is
[10094.78 --> 10102.30]  considered optimal to reduce motion sickness okay there is a solid argument to be made that 8k
[10102.86 --> 10109.50]  is unnecessary and certainly anything beyond it will be triply unnecessary counterpoint
[10110.22 --> 10115.98]  yeah yeah of course the type of data being consumed may change in the future you're saying we will never
[10115.98 --> 10120.54]  need it well no no hold on hold on hold on is that what you said i am saying we will never need it but
[10120.54 --> 10126.70]  what i'm what i'm trying to lay out is sort of the the groundwork for sure but you're only talking
[10126.70 --> 10132.70]  about video and you're talking about 2d frame video on a so far okay but i haven't gotten there yet all
[10132.70 --> 10142.06]  right okay so we need timers if 8k if 8k is realistically as far as we're going to get before we have filled
[10142.06 --> 10149.58]  up too much of our field of vision and is no longer discernible anyway then my argument is that we are
[10149.58 --> 10155.66]  kind of reaching a point where we can at least see the final destination sort of and that could be two
[10155.66 --> 10163.26]  8k images in stereoscopic 3d through a vr headset or through some kind of holographic uh you know
[10163.26 --> 10170.30]  projection system or whatever else should know that it's not just resolution though no no absolutely that's
[10170.30 --> 10175.02]  part of it that's not really that strong of an argument however however i mean we already we
[10175.02 --> 10182.86]  already again though we know what that might look like so so we are we are approaching the limits of
[10182.86 --> 10188.30]  what the eye can discern and we're sitting at like the the highest bitrate blu-rays or something in the
[10188.30 --> 10198.54]  neighborhood of 100 megabit so if we say okay 100 megabit times four is 400 megabit times two is 800 megabit
[10198.54 --> 10205.50]  for a stream that is now stereoscopic and let's let's throw let's go to gigabit okay to say okay
[10205.50 --> 10209.58]  we're gonna need uh we'll need more color depth than we have today it might come in bursts when
[10209.58 --> 10214.94]  you're buffering and stuff like that but even that isn't really enough to fill that pipe not even close
[10214.94 --> 10221.42]  yeah not even a significant fraction not even a little now you could make the argument for a five user
[10221.42 --> 10228.86]  household um all consuming that at once all consuming that at once i would counter that point
[10228.86 --> 10236.70]  by saying i pretty much promise you that that experience for at least in our lifetimes is not
[10236.70 --> 10242.38]  going to be something that all five of those users are consuming in much the same way that right now
[10242.38 --> 10246.86]  you might have five people watching netflix in the house i promise you they're not all at 4k
[10251.10 --> 10255.98]  there that's my argument why are they not all at 4k you just think one of them is on like a
[10255.98 --> 10259.26]  yeah someone's probably your device someone's probably on the phone so not not every person
[10259.26 --> 10264.94]  has like a tv basically has a top top of the line experience is kind of i'm saying that you don't have
[10264.94 --> 10271.50]  five theater rooms the vast majority of households or whatever might have at most one of these this
[10271.50 --> 10275.82]  peak tier experience yeah and then you have phones or laptops or computers or whatever else
[10275.82 --> 10283.34]  that's my argument um yeah so my thing i think would be new alternate experiences so yes i do think
[10283.34 --> 10291.90]  we would have a hard time getting there in in like flat frame video player type of content um but
[10292.78 --> 10298.30]  i i made like an offhand comment earlier about like streaming 3d models whatever i wasn't describing
[10298.30 --> 10303.74]  it very well but that's sort of what i'm talking about sure really really high poly count complicated
[10303.74 --> 10310.94]  things being live streamed instead of rendered locally um game stream style to your house in in
[10310.94 --> 10316.62]  more complex things that might not exist yet in regards to how we consume content could start
[10316.62 --> 10322.38]  hitting bandwidth levels pretty hard count i think it's super likely not really a lot of the market is
[10322.38 --> 10328.22]  going towards uh actually while we're increasing this oh you can get 10 gig to your house a lot of
[10328.22 --> 10333.02]  the market is going towards making it so that less data is being sent out yep that's exactly where i
[10333.02 --> 10339.82]  was going to go to because at the end of the day the higher the the the bigger the pipe between the
[10339.82 --> 10348.46]  service and the user the more data was being stored and as we talked about in the video yeah in the video
[10348.46 --> 10356.38]  we did recently why youtube should charge for 4k um basically the the trend that we were looking at was the
[10356.38 --> 10363.98]  way that storage is not getting cheaper anymore and you don't just like plug ethernet cables into
[10363.98 --> 10369.50]  hard drives either you need systems to run this data transfer to put things in packages send them
[10369.50 --> 10374.30]  out handle all that now we will still get faster compute we will still get specialized encoders and
[10374.30 --> 10384.46]  decoders yeah but and that and but those will exist to minimize that data storage burden to minimize that data
[10384.46 --> 10393.50]  transmission burden no service no company anywhere is looking to just use up more infrastructure let's go
[10393.50 --> 10396.70]  yeah yeah yeah yeah it's not happening yeah
[10396.70 --> 10404.78]  so that's my argument i'm saying it now this might be one of those i don't see bitcoin going anywhere
[10405.66 --> 10411.26]  moments 10 years from now when everyone needs 10 gig to have the best gaming experience um but you
[10411.26 --> 10419.26]  know what's funny is i might have even made a stronger argument for 10 gig back when um back when we were
[10419.26 --> 10426.22]  back when game streaming was in its infancy and we couldn't really see the trajectory of it as it is now
[10426.22 --> 10436.62]  i i just it it's pretty clear that to keep latency down compute has to stay down data rates have to stay
[10436.62 --> 10444.94]  down and we are not going to see like like an uncompressed you know 4k game stream product not not in
[10444.94 --> 10451.42]  any reasonable amount of time yeah uh this is a tangent thing i just want to say it before i get
[10451.42 --> 10457.74]  mobile gnome on the forum and also in floatplane chat uh mentioned today is the fifth anniversary
[10458.46 --> 10467.98]  of the streak of wan so a wan show never being missed at all oh really and it is hey and it is the
[10467.98 --> 10477.50]  123rd episode in a row of linus and luke nice yeah i we knew we had a streak we just weren't sure
[10477.50 --> 10483.74]  what it was yeah we didn't know how long it was so it's over two years then yeah nice yeah i'm not
[10483.74 --> 10490.78]  going to be the one to end it me either i'm clearly yeah he's on vacation right now no not today oh not
[10490.78 --> 10497.58]  today i was on oh okay all right all right it was up until yesterday got it yeah all right so
[10497.58 --> 10500.14]  it's technically back at work that's good yeah all right dan hit us
[10502.78 --> 10510.06]  okay this one is from anonymous in the future would you create an add-on like honey but warns us when we
[10510.06 --> 10516.46]  check out trying to buy an item that you have tested with labs to not live up to their claimed
[10516.46 --> 10526.86]  expectations that's a pretty cool idea um i could see man i could see a third-party websites getting
[10526.86 --> 10531.50]  super mad like especially if we got into the business of it like selling those products or
[10531.50 --> 10537.98]  whatever else like a competitor basically like warning customers on your website that you shouldn't
[10537.98 --> 10544.54]  buy something from them that seems maybe that's even man how would we yeah i think we couldn't do it
[10544.54 --> 10549.34]  for segments that we yeah for that we participate in but in ones that we didn't or maybe if we just
[10549.34 --> 10554.54]  never did that then that could be a pretty cool alternative business model for it where we basically
[10554.54 --> 10562.38]  just go hey um here's a link to add one with our affiliate code obviously from this very same site
[10563.26 --> 10569.90]  um that we that we recommend that's pretty cool i don't know that labs is going to want to make such
[10569.90 --> 10576.86]  concrete individual product recommendations though so that's a challenge we might be able to suggest
[10576.86 --> 10585.50]  possible alternatives but um we could maybe use the commonly compared against tool yeah yeah but like
[10585.50 --> 10590.54]  oh man especially for so many products are down to personal taste right like i'm headphones are one of
[10590.54 --> 10595.10]  the classic ones because that's uh one of the one of the product categories that we're going to be best
[10595.10 --> 10600.06]  set up for very like imprint on a certain sound signature yeah and then just like or you might
[10600.06 --> 10605.98]  have a weird shaped dome yep and you just like you know that one's honestly better for you so we would
[10605.98 --> 10611.02]  always need to be really careful about making a solid recommendation on someone else's website where
[10611.02 --> 10616.38]  the return is going to be their liability and not our own right so there's like kind of ethical
[10616.38 --> 10621.34]  challenges there too i don't know we'd have to we'd have to figure out the best way to deal with that yeah yeah
[10621.34 --> 10629.34]  okay hey guys recently just started my first full-time job in networking for a very large group
[10629.34 --> 10634.78]  kind of been chucked in the deep end any advice for dealing with the incredible information overload
[10634.78 --> 10641.02]  that comes with starting a new job in an unfamiliar field read the docs man yeah go for it go for it go
[10641.02 --> 10648.78]  hard go hard that's all i can really say he said large organization so hopefully there's docs um if there aren't docs
[10651.34 --> 10656.22]  um networking stuff wow if there aren't docs
[10658.46 --> 10660.94]  stay there long enough to get good experience and look for a new job
[10662.70 --> 10668.62]  thanks i don't know stay long enough that it looks good on the resume and not bad yeah yeah yeah yeah
[10670.94 --> 10676.78]  or just press a huge amount of importance that you need to make them and be the one to champion the
[10676.78 --> 10683.98]  creation of them because you you need that yeah creating systems is almost always a higher position
[10683.98 --> 10691.34]  in the uh in the org chart than just following created systems almost always i got a couple of uh
[10691.34 --> 10696.86]  uh messages in the chat here that i want to um kind of highlight here recon messenger messenger says
[10696.86 --> 10702.46]  speaking of headphones what headphones are linus and luke using uh they're 80 uh something
[10705.02 --> 10710.78]  m50x they suck they're uncomfortable uh there was this whole trendy thing for a while where everyone
[10710.78 --> 10720.22]  was like super hard on for these and at the time i didn't understand it i still don't understand it they
[10720.22 --> 10727.02]  were always commodity like i think the argument was they're like used in recording studios yeah
[10727.02 --> 10732.70]  they're used in recording studios because they're basically disposable yeah if you're gonna break them
[10732.70 --> 10737.82]  you don't get the good ones you had a box of these you just you got musicians you just throw them at
[10737.82 --> 10743.26]  them and they wear them and if you destroy them then you just give them another one yeah so someone they're
[10743.26 --> 10749.42]  also close back so they're nice and isolating someone grabbed on to that little like like factoid
[10749.90 --> 10757.50]  that these are like used in recording studios completely missed the context had absolutely no idea what
[10757.50 --> 10766.38]  headphones are supposed to sound like and was like sick sick yeah let's go do they do the no yeah they
[10766.38 --> 10773.90]  they yes they do they're they're yeah they're here because they are cheap and disposable and we needed four
[10773.90 --> 10779.34]  pairs for the they're just movies podcasts and stuff and they were cheap they're good enough yeah
[10779.42 --> 10787.26]  um and then uh in the float plane chat from jake uh luke doesn't put his camera up during our twice a
[10787.26 --> 10793.42]  week stand-ups uh we can hear him chewing but he blames the birds how would you like to respond to that
[10793.42 --> 10802.54]  i just you've been outed sir everything i do that's wrong is the bird's fault um no i don't know i can
[10802.54 --> 10810.30]  i can put it on jake okay geez i don't have a dog that i can cuddle like you do in yours all right
[10810.30 --> 10816.86]  oh i love it okay all right dan hit us okay this one's from ari uh people who say your merch is
[10816.86 --> 10820.94]  overpriced have never worn it thanks for making nice quality clothes for my question
[10821.58 --> 10824.70]  what fictional technology do you wish you could review
[10824.70 --> 10833.42]  oh man this is a cool one how much fun would it be to review like uh like uh the the star trek uh
[10834.38 --> 10840.54]  beam beam me up whatever those are called teleporters or whatever like oh no no no the food
[10840.54 --> 10847.58]  fabricators oh yeah that would be that's the kind of technology that is going to go through a period of
[10847.58 --> 10854.38]  like being absolutely horrible atrocious yeah it'll have a short period of being horrible a long
[10854.38 --> 10859.90]  period of being like kind of acceptable and then they're going to get like really good and things
[10859.90 --> 10865.66]  are going to get really interesting yeah yeah yeah um just like you just like grind up cockroaches into
[10865.66 --> 10869.42]  it and it like spits out a burger and you're gonna be like how did they do this it's gonna be awesome
[10869.42 --> 10875.66]  my brain immediately went to lightsabers there's material stuff because like how does the grip feel
[10875.66 --> 10879.98]  and style stuff like that there's a lot of style involved craftsmanship but then there's also like
[10879.98 --> 10885.58]  crystal choice and like yada yada yada yada yada i just i don't know my brain immediately went to
[10885.58 --> 10892.54]  that all right nerds the lot of ya uh this one's from james with multiple lmg branches e.g labs would
[10892.54 --> 10898.06]  you consider creating a team to investigate shady practices by tech companies for example activision's
[10898.06 --> 10903.50]  broken anti-cheat that bans innocent players and their lack of response slash appeal process i mean i
[10903.50 --> 10908.70]  think that in the longer term we obviously yeah we want to cover the industry from every direction
[10908.70 --> 10914.70]  that we can um but i don't know that we would have a dedicated team just for shady practices i think
[10914.70 --> 10921.50]  that you can expect to see um especially if talk linked and tech longer see some success i think you
[10921.50 --> 10926.94]  could expect to see us build out that team in order to do more content like that tech linked is our news
[10926.94 --> 10933.50]  um i'm just gonna say news group but it's not a news group that's a different thing uh but that's
[10933.50 --> 10943.34]  kind of our our news focused um group right now i don't know i i don't it's it's not a top priority
[10943.34 --> 10947.10]  on the roadmap i think the next thing you're going to see from us is a reacts channel and the next thing
[10947.10 --> 10953.42]  is you're going to see after that are going to be um more product focused stuff as we build up the lab
[10953.42 --> 10962.54]  okay and now i have a bit of an interesting one here um can you explain the need behind improving
[10962.54 --> 10969.98]  wancho one big draw for me was wancho was the lack of gimmicky slapstick nonsense like the spinning wheel
[10969.98 --> 10976.86]  i'd love to understand your thoughts driving it i thought this was pretty pretty mean but also probably
[10976.86 --> 10981.34]  quite an interesting discussion i spoke with a few of the other team members yesterday and
[10981.34 --> 10990.78]  um it's kind of kind of nice what you spoke with a few of the other team members yesterday and it
[10990.78 --> 10997.98]  was kind of nice yeah hearing linus's maybe thoughts behind improving uh oh okay the wancho that's stance
[10997.98 --> 11003.66]  for a long time has been don't touch it um including with the thumbnails for the wancho being kind of
[11003.66 --> 11009.90]  generally extremely old age youtube and they've like never grown or gotten better and people have
[11009.90 --> 11014.06]  offered to like hey maybe we should make better thumbnails for it and it's always just been like
[11014.06 --> 11021.10]  no um so i'm i'm a little bit surprised by the change i'm surprised that you're saying that you
[11021.10 --> 11027.10]  like that the show has never been like gimmicky or jank because i think that's all the show has ever been
[11027.10 --> 11034.06]  um i guess not technically gimmicks in this form but like it's never been professional
[11034.06 --> 11040.62]  it's a little gimmicky i guess sure it's not slapstick though and it creates very interesting
[11040.62 --> 11046.78]  discussions is the show in general not just kind of slapsticky we've made slapstick that has a kind
[11046.78 --> 11051.82]  of specific definition does it i genuinely don't know what it is i guess i thought it was just like
[11053.18 --> 11059.18]  like slapstick would be like visual gags and stuff like oh okay yeah and this is this would be a gimmick
[11059.18 --> 11064.86]  that is a bit um for sure i i'm just i'm in listening mode right now though i mean i don't
[11064.86 --> 11073.42]  i'll i'll give my two cents but i feel like we've been on a very good arc for a while um i think the
[11073.42 --> 11080.46]  beginning of that arc was probably the beginning of merch messages i don't know how it happened but the
[11080.46 --> 11087.18]  show as a whole changed not just the inclusion of merch messages it's really long now so that's
[11087.18 --> 11092.54]  interesting um there's no shortage of content i think that's a big part of it because of merch
[11092.54 --> 11097.50]  messages yeah to be completely honest yeah you guys make the show what it is because like the same
[11097.50 --> 11102.62]  thing happened to wan show that happened to lzt where when when linus and i first started way back
[11102.62 --> 11109.74]  in the day there was too much stuff to cover so we just covered the things that showed up at the door
[11110.54 --> 11115.82]  and there was always enough content and then over time the amount of things that showed up at the door
[11115.82 --> 11123.58]  reduced because the frenzy of tech being in a relatively early stage kind of stopped and then
[11123.58 --> 11129.02]  it happened with phones and then that fell off uh and then it started becoming a situation where like
[11129.02 --> 11134.62]  okay well there isn't enough new stuff to cover so we have to create new content so we started creating
[11134.62 --> 11138.78]  shows and we started creating different content types and experiments and whatever else building
[11138.78 --> 11144.46]  things that were more dependent on the personality rather than the product that we're covering yeah so that
[11144.46 --> 11150.70]  changed over time similar thing happened to wan show where there used to be just this infinite pool
[11150.70 --> 11157.26]  of tech news that we could cover and we would just grab the best parts of it and over time it got to
[11157.26 --> 11163.02]  the point where it's like wow there's really not a lot to talk about this week how do we make this
[11163.02 --> 11168.38]  interesting and we just started going off the rail more and then with merch messages you guys
[11168.38 --> 11174.78]  kind of throw us off the rail which i think is even more interesting um so i think we've been on a good
[11174.78 --> 11181.42]  track i don't see necessarily the need to change things when we've been on probably the best track that
[11181.42 --> 11190.06]  we've been on for a while um but i didn't mind the wheel i thought it was interesting um i think the wheel
[11190.06 --> 11197.02]  can't be an every week thing no it wouldn't because it depends on there being topics that make sense to
[11197.02 --> 11202.70]  be on the wheel and it depends on there being enough of them um but i i don't see anything against it
[11203.66 --> 11209.10]  i don't think working to make something better is a bad thing
[11209.10 --> 11218.70]  so yeah okay so i'll um thank you for having my i've typed up some of my things that was sort of
[11218.70 --> 11223.98]  where i was going to land on uh but i'll tell you some of the other things so um i can tell you right
[11223.98 --> 11228.30]  now the reason we've not changed wan show in the past is not because we haven't had ideas for how to
[11228.30 --> 11236.46]  make it better it's because um if we're gonna hire someone there's i'm cheap um and wan show is the
[11236.46 --> 11244.70]  lowest possible priority thing to spend money on in the entire company wan show is literally
[11244.70 --> 11251.42]  at the very bottom of the totem pole i would rather i would rather pay for cleaning services for the
[11251.42 --> 11258.30]  year for every employee of the company than hire someone who's dedicated to wan show that has happened
[11258.30 --> 11265.98]  that happened yeah um traditionally this i i'm i'm i'm trying to explain what my position has been on
[11265.98 --> 11274.22]  wan show wan show was wan show came about as a necessary evil like filler it killed it killed two
[11274.22 --> 11280.14]  birds with one stone uh bird number one was it gave us some kind of foothold into live which at the time
[11280.78 --> 11286.54]  it wasn't clear to me uh how that was going to evolve um and how meaningful it was going to be but
[11287.50 --> 11293.50]  it was a trend and it was something that was not going away and we needed some kind of presence in in
[11293.50 --> 11298.78]  live and i was like okay well the easiest lowest hanging fruit at a time in my life when i have
[11298.78 --> 11305.10]  an infant child and a fledgling company is q a so that's how it starts and then from q a well people
[11305.10 --> 11311.98]  just started asking about what's going on in the tech world so it's not that much of a leap to go from
[11311.98 --> 11317.26]  just trying to preemptively answer the questions that you would have had which is what's my take on x y
[11317.26 --> 11323.50]  or c in the tech world right um so wan show um serves that purpose and then the second purpose it
[11323.50 --> 11331.18]  served was it was killing us trying to upload seven ltt's a week so we made wan show to fill one of those
[11331.18 --> 11340.14]  upload slots um and it was because it was live and because we branded it as a podcast it was easy to sell
[11340.14 --> 11346.94]  to sponsors for if not the same rates at least a close enough rate uh compared to what we could charge
[11346.94 --> 11356.46]  for ltt videos that we could afford to um to not do an ltt video that day at only the cost of about an
[11356.46 --> 11362.62]  hour and a half of each mine in luke's time uh which so it was it was a very it was a very calculated move
[11363.26 --> 11371.18]  the creation of wan show as for why it was a low priority to improve it um well it's because
[11371.18 --> 11379.98]  wan show morphed into the one way that we can really engage with the community and um kind of
[11379.98 --> 11385.98]  touch base with you guys on a weekly basis and to serve that purpose wan show doesn't need a fancy set
[11385.98 --> 11394.94]  it doesn't need better lights it doesn't need 4k cameras it doesn't need really anything um we are not
[11394.94 --> 11402.54]  going to be more professional on the show so making the show more professional doesn't necessarily make
[11402.54 --> 11407.10]  a lot of sense and could even contribute to making it seem less genuine so i have this thing that has
[11407.10 --> 11412.86]  kind of this ceiling for how much we can charge for it from a sponsorship standpoint so from like a
[11412.86 --> 11419.34]  business point of view i can invest more in it i will not get a return on it um and then from a
[11419.34 --> 11424.38]  personal point of view i was just like i don't know wan show's fun yeah and it's fun the way it is
[11424.38 --> 11431.34]  yep um however there are a few things that have prompted this uh this recent change so first of all
[11431.34 --> 11436.22]  i want to make it clear that our new wan show writer i guess i'll call it a writing position our new
[11436.22 --> 11445.34]  wan show writers primary raison d'etre is not to create gimmicky nonsense um the their their primary purpose
[11445.34 --> 11451.18]  is to make sure that the stories we have for the week are better fleshed out and more accurate
[11451.98 --> 11458.22]  i think we are reaching the point where there's just no excuse for us to get details wrong and
[11458.22 --> 11464.14]  honestly i think it's fair to say that the quality of while the titles might still be kind of
[11464.14 --> 11470.38]  inflammatory the quality of the uh of the way the topics are written out is better than what we've had
[11470.38 --> 11474.94]  in the past is that yep i i think it's i think it's been pretty balanced i think there's some areas where
[11475.34 --> 11479.34]  there could be some improvement but realistically this is their first week of actually preparing
[11479.34 --> 11487.82]  the doc for us so a great job um as for why i do want part of their job to be you know gimmicks and
[11487.82 --> 11492.70]  segments and stuff like that well because i think they're fun um there's nothing wrong with trying new
[11492.70 --> 11499.26]  things like luke said and a big part of the inspiration for these segments is the success of the merch messages
[11499.26 --> 11506.70]  segment you guys might not have realized it but we totally created this gimmicky way to interact
[11506.70 --> 11511.42]  with the show that has actually ended up making the show a more fun for us like i never would have
[11511.42 --> 11516.70]  even wanted to do a three hour when show before but now i kind of enjoy it um like at a certain point
[11516.70 --> 11522.38]  i'm like i'm hungry now and i kind of have to pee but like yeah you know like there's a limit right but
[11522.38 --> 11528.54]  but but i but i enjoy it more and that's why the show is longer um and i know you guys enjoy it more
[11528.54 --> 11535.58]  because i can see it in the analytics so it's working for both of us so let's do it yeah um
[11537.98 --> 11543.18]  so we're gonna try stuff and sometimes it'll land and sometimes it'll be crap and we won't do it again
[11543.18 --> 11553.66]  hit me dan okay excellent this is from denver uh really yeah the whole city there's another one
[11553.66 --> 11562.30]  it's the best city in in denver uh i need i need 10 gig for 321 backups oh you don't need it i want
[11562.30 --> 11571.50]  4k 3d and want to move past the draconian 30 and 60 hertz paradigm that's not say i want 4k 3d 4k 3d
[11571.50 --> 11577.10]  uh 120 000 hertz okay but you can want it but that doesn't make it exist if if you're gonna watch
[11577.10 --> 11585.98]  that one video uh you could just download it my home internet is 40 gig uh and other than transceivers
[11585.98 --> 11595.34]  fiber is fiber be it one gig 10 gig even a hundred gig yes but i never opposed building out fiber
[11595.34 --> 11600.86]  i said you don't need a 10 gig i don't know why this is so hard for people
[11602.94 --> 11611.34]  but the thing we were talking about was if it was necessary for the user to have 10 gig in the home
[11611.34 --> 11618.78]  and i would also make the argument that if you are a 321 backing up something with that kind of um data
[11618.78 --> 11624.38]  requirements on a daily basis sounds like a business that sounds like it is not home use yeah so while you
[11624.38 --> 11630.38]  are technically in a resident at a residential address i would i am going to stand by my
[11630.38 --> 11636.62]  original statement i'm going to say you are not a home user there yeah yeah we're talking about if it
[11636.62 --> 11642.14]  was necessary there there's a bunch of uh which has to come first type of questions with this type of
[11642.14 --> 11646.70]  stuff where like if you wanted to build a service that needs those types of bandwidth requirements
[11646.70 --> 11654.86]  well no company's going to do that if no one is able to receive that type of data so like we would
[11654.86 --> 11661.26]  need home users to be able to have things like 10 gig in place the the plans would need to be available
[11662.62 --> 11670.30]  so that a company could make something that actually uses that whole pipe right so like it's not a bad
[11670.30 --> 11674.30]  thing to do it's just for the user it's not necessary right now that's all
[11677.10 --> 11682.54]  okay here's one from james hi linus i would like to go to ltx but my wife is giving birth to our
[11682.54 --> 11689.74]  firstborn my wife my wife i forgot he was going to do that to our firstborn in late march do you have
[11689.74 --> 11697.18]  any tips for traveling with a newborn and should i take my four month son to ltx no no you would have to
[11697.18 --> 11704.14]  drive 14 hours to get to ltx just don't i traveled with a newborn a couple times and it sucked every
[11704.14 --> 11712.78]  time no one had fun um come come later i'll see you next year yeah yeah i'm sorry man uh i wish i did
[11712.78 --> 11722.30]  have uh some tips for you we're into potentials now okay right um sorry okay so many i might have to just
[11722.30 --> 11727.66]  do these then because if i have to read them anyway then um okay anonymous says when you play
[11727.66 --> 11731.42]  beat saber do you feel that external tracking like with the valve index works better than internal
[11731.42 --> 11736.62]  tracking like with the quest 2 my saber sometimes float away from my hand in the quest 2 so there are
[11736.62 --> 11743.34]  always going to be technical limitations when it comes to occlusion which is uh when your sensor and your
[11743.98 --> 11750.14]  object are occluded that is there's an object between them of some sort uh you can make up a lot of
[11750.14 --> 11757.82]  ground with really accurate accelerometers and gyroscopes like valve valve excuse me um meta uh does build
[11757.82 --> 11766.62]  into their controllers but those are inherently going to drift they they do they must they will um so
[11766.62 --> 11773.02]  there's that you're always going to need to kind of snap them back to reality there goes gravity you know
[11773.02 --> 11780.46]  um every once in a while like like like really a lot um external trackers especially for full body
[11780.46 --> 11788.94]  tracking i mean i think they will always have an advantage whether that advantage is enough to
[11788.94 --> 11795.74]  justify the additional cost and space and wiring requirements maybe not maybe the next valve headset is
[11795.74 --> 11803.18]  going to make me regret drilling a bunch of holes in my rec room um to put up lighthouses but um
[11804.54 --> 11809.66]  yeah so for full body tracking it's not really an option for me to use inside out for now because i
[11809.66 --> 11814.78]  have a sensor on my waist sensors on my feet sensors on my hands and sensors on my head from a headset
[11814.78 --> 11821.50]  you're just not going to be able to see them all and and maintain the natural movement for my avatar but if
[11821.50 --> 11826.86]  i was not doing full body tracking then yeah i think an array could be built that's good enough
[11826.86 --> 11830.38]  um even if the current stuff is not quite there yet especially at the consumer level
[11832.22 --> 11837.34]  um okay i got another one hey linus and luke i usually watch the wan show on saturday mornings
[11837.34 --> 11840.94]  and wanted to thank you for the content uh what's your favorite dad joke
[11844.54 --> 11850.94]  i i think the best dad jokes aren't like fixed i think they're just constant puns yeah it's got to be
[11850.94 --> 11856.30]  people well i mean actually the social team asked me to tell a dad joke for for a float
[11856.30 --> 11860.38]  plane exclusive and i was like you don't you don't come up with it on the spot yeah like i
[11860.38 --> 11867.10]  i constantly am telling dad jokes but it's because that's what like makes it a dad joke yeah my brain's
[11867.10 --> 11872.06]  just actually wired that way i have heard people that have like recitable dad jokes but i don't think
[11872.06 --> 11877.58]  that's very common i think most of them are just play on word yeah and what's funny about them
[11877.58 --> 11884.78]  is the way that you've gone and interpreted something that that person said 45 seconds ago
[11885.58 --> 11891.18]  yeah and and like the oh i knew it was going to be something that just happened but i would not have
[11891.18 --> 11897.82]  gone there with it you know um i'm sorry i'm sorry i don't i don't have something i gotta i gotta address
[11897.82 --> 11902.78]  something in chat because people still don't understand and that's okay but i gotta address it uh what about
[11902.78 --> 11907.66]  when a game is a one terabyte download what about when it is download it
[11909.98 --> 11916.54]  if the game server is still incapable of actually sending you what your pipe is capable of receiving
[11916.54 --> 11924.46]  then it's irrelevant and are they going to send you 10 gigs a second to just you yeah not just you
[11924.46 --> 11934.46]  to everyone who has a connection like that good luck uh ever maybe foreseeable future near future
[11935.02 --> 11941.18]  near future i seriously doubt it yeah but i want it oh my gosh you can want it we're talking about is it
[11941.82 --> 11951.10]  necessary okay cool moving forward james asks linus do you code uh the answer is no sorry i
[11951.10 --> 11960.06]  i just never i never learned and realistically i'm at a point in my life running the company with the
[11960.06 --> 11965.66]  kids blah blah blah where if i was going to pick up something it'd probably be like a musical instrument
[11965.66 --> 11972.70]  or something at this point like i just i don't think that would be my next endeavor i think i i would
[11972.70 --> 11978.22]  probably want to learn enough to be dangerous like uh just you know simple things like scripting but then
[11978.22 --> 11983.02]  with chat gpt being as powerful as it is i mean yeah i guess i'd like to know enough to be able to
[11983.02 --> 11988.78]  like proofread like a chat i was just gonna say i think right now well okay not right now i think in
[11988.78 --> 11998.38]  the near future a more usable goal would be able to understand yeah being able to try to to read it even
[11998.38 --> 12004.30]  if i can't write it and debug things sure or at least this is why i'm i'm tripping right now is i don't
[12004.30 --> 12008.62]  necessarily think that you should be able to fix it but i think you should be able to understand why
[12008.62 --> 12015.02]  it's not working so you can ask chat gpt to fix it yeah because i've had code outputs from chat gpt
[12015.02 --> 12020.22]  that i've been like oh it's getting this error and i think it's because of this can you fix that and
[12020.22 --> 12024.94]  it'll be like yep and it'll actually do it so like that doesn't really require a lot sure and as
[12024.94 --> 12028.06]  long as you are familiar with the tools and stuff and could get it to do that then you'll be fine and
[12028.06 --> 12034.06]  i think there's a certain amount of like human nature that leads us to kind of take the easiest solution to a problem
[12034.46 --> 12041.02]  and for me the easiest solution to a coding problem is to go to one of the over a dozen
[12041.82 --> 12048.78]  um like professional capable programmers that i have at my disposal now and say hey can you help me
[12048.78 --> 12055.74]  with this yeah um like learning that's a dangerous thing and i think that's where a lot of the kind of
[12055.74 --> 12064.22]  the stereotypical dumb know nothing executive kind of comes from is that when it's so much faster
[12064.70 --> 12072.22]  and your time is so so pressed um when it's so much faster easier and more efficient it's not
[12072.22 --> 12078.62]  efficient for you to learn things it's not efficient to learn yeah learning is super inefficient the good
[12078.62 --> 12083.42]  news for me is i get bored and i get frustrated and like depressed when i'm not learning things so
[12083.42 --> 12089.42]  i'm just i'm sort of self-motivated to keep doing it but if i wasn't if i didn't just have a joy of
[12089.42 --> 12097.26]  learning i feel like i'd already just be like kind of useless you know like i there like there is no
[12097.26 --> 12102.94]  reason for me to know anything about how cameras operate there is always someone to do it for me
[12102.94 --> 12111.34]  however when the pandemic shutdown came along what i discovered was that just because i i tend to be
[12111.34 --> 12117.26]  naturally curious i had actually absorbed enough that is it as good as our people who do it every
[12117.26 --> 12123.10]  day all day no of course not i'm not going to pretend it is but it was did the channel survive did we
[12123.10 --> 12130.54]  miss and i think so all right so clearly i managed to i managed to gain a serviceable enough knowledge
[12130.54 --> 12139.02]  that i was able to set it up myself um and so i don't remember what the question was no i'm not
[12139.02 --> 12146.06]  going to learn to code uh because that's um it's something that i have almost no need to interact with
[12146.06 --> 12152.38]  on a daily basis whereas like cameras i i really do even if i'm usually on this side of them and
[12152.38 --> 12159.66]  they're usually on the other side of them uh the next one is for me this is question for luke what
[12159.66 --> 12164.86]  is your biggest struggle as a new dev after graduation i'm coming up on two years after school
[12164.86 --> 12171.02]  and i'm struggling to find a motivation to pursue learning projects on my own time due to life
[12171.02 --> 12176.86]  obligations uh well interesting question for me because a i didn't graduate and b um
[12179.42 --> 12184.70]  after school i was immediately doing things that had nothing to do with software development at all
[12185.34 --> 12189.74]  and also while i was in school i was doing a lot of things that had nothing to do with software
[12189.74 --> 12197.34]  development at all um so i don't know uh it doesn't sound like your problem is necessarily
[12197.34 --> 12203.42]  finding work or working it sounds like your problem is finding motivation to pursue learning
[12203.42 --> 12208.70]  and projects on your own time and or work-life balance and or work-life balance that is a totally
[12208.70 --> 12215.18]  separate question motivation is an interesting thing in its own right um i don't find motivation to
[12215.18 --> 12219.90]  be in my own personal experience and you're asking me so i'm going to answer it this way um and
[12219.90 --> 12224.54]  i don't know if this is legit for everyone i don't know i don't find motivation in what most
[12224.54 --> 12230.46]  people see from that or take from that word to be super useful to me personally i find dedication
[12230.46 --> 12236.70]  or discipline to be super useful to me personally motivation seems like a kind of a cop out a burst
[12236.70 --> 12240.70]  thing right and something that's only useful for a short period of time like you can just hope that
[12240.70 --> 12246.46]  you'll have it whereas if dedication is something you can control yeah so like i can see that you need
[12246.46 --> 12251.58]  to uh employ like discipline or something to make yourself do those things if those are things that
[12251.58 --> 12256.54]  you need to do big if you might not need to you might just be able to go to work do your job go
[12256.54 --> 12263.02]  home and not do these types of things you don't have to i know it's very popular in the space and
[12263.02 --> 12268.54]  i'm not saying it's a bad thing to be super clear but you don't have to do that stuff outside of work
[12268.54 --> 12273.42]  you don't need homework you're now graduated you could go to work do your job go home and not do it
[12273.42 --> 12280.14]  anymore um but if if you feel like you should or if you want to for career advancement reasons or
[12280.14 --> 12287.42]  whatever i would use what motivation you do have to set up a situation uh where you're able to use
[12287.42 --> 12296.46]  something um like determination discipline um those types of things to actually get that stuff done um
[12296.46 --> 12305.58]  um that's it i've kind of addressed this topic on wanshow before and i hope i did it better this time
[12305.58 --> 12311.50]  um but yeah like if you need to get something done motivation is not the right thing in my opinion
[12311.50 --> 12318.62]  to look towards because it's it's uh it's a resource that definitely depletes and you need to find more
[12318.62 --> 12325.26]  rigid things to be able to lean on or at least i do again they asked me delta bruggerman says here's what
[12325.26 --> 12331.34]  chat gpt had to say regarding 10 gigabits i was hoping someone would do this first it would enable
[12331.34 --> 12335.34]  multiple users in the household to engage in high bandwidth activities simultaneously such as
[12335.34 --> 12339.82]  streaming 4k video gaming and teleconferencing without any lag or buffering second it would
[12339.82 --> 12344.30]  enable faster download and upload speeds which would be beneficial for tasks such as working from
[12344.30 --> 12351.26]  home online learning and remote backups therefore it would be necessary therefore it would be necessary
[12351.26 --> 12356.78]  and chat gpt you can be confidently wrong yeah that's uh that's all we managed to prove there
[12356.78 --> 12364.62]  i'm afraid that's a one out of ten there um nicholas b i watched pure living for life's video on their
[12364.62 --> 12370.30]  horrifying cyber bullying story how can you to be an engaging relatable and successful youtuber while
[12370.30 --> 12377.50]  keeping your life private for from your community i mean i think that it wears on a lot of youtubers
[12377.50 --> 12382.78]  um i think that it can kind of that can kind of that pressure can kind of manifest in a lot of ways
[12382.78 --> 12390.14]  that you see ones that are like neurotic about maintaining their their privacy um like i know i know
[12390.14 --> 12400.86]  of one that either did or does uh keep their face private that literally would not leave their house like
[12400.86 --> 12406.22]  i spoke to this person and they had not left their house more than maybe twice in the last six months
[12406.22 --> 12413.98]  because they had a highly recognizable voice and were so concerned about maintaining that secrecy
[12413.98 --> 12421.82]  that they they became essentially a shut-in yeah um and then you've got people that are you know put
[12421.82 --> 12428.06]  their entire lives online you know they're themselves their parents their kids their you know their
[12428.06 --> 12432.62]  their pregnancies their births their deaths their you know whatever else right and they just kind of
[12432.62 --> 12442.14]  uh they just kind of embrace it um i think that i think that both ways eventually burn you out and
[12442.14 --> 12450.06]  everything in between eventually burns you out and um you have to learn to kind of find a balance between
[12450.62 --> 12454.70]  sticking up for yourself um letting things roll off your back um
[12454.70 --> 12459.82]  um like being sad sometimes
[12463.18 --> 12466.70]  getting mad learning to kind of get over that um
[12467.98 --> 12473.58]  yeah it's tough i don't know i mean like to be clear one of the things that i remind myself constantly
[12473.58 --> 12481.90]  is like i chose this i could turn it off tomorrow i mean how how famous would i be in a year if i didn't
[12481.90 --> 12489.90]  upload a single video for a year not very like i i'm not famous famous i'm internet famous niche famous
[12489.90 --> 12495.18]  right like it's i went through this and i was still on wancho every week yeah the amount that i would get
[12495.18 --> 12503.02]  recognized walking around like plummeted really fast when i wasn't just constantly in videos yeah
[12503.02 --> 12511.42]  yeah yeah so like that's the thing is uh there's that constant reminder that's um for me that's like
[12511.42 --> 12515.34]  yeah i i could end this and that's encouraging
[12520.62 --> 12524.62]  um alexander says hey excited about the henley shirt and screwdriver screwdriver thanks for being
[12524.62 --> 12528.30]  transparent about your products and how the company works how do you guys come up with new products to
[12528.30 --> 12533.10]  work towards slash develop to sell an ltt store i mean sometimes it's just like i was looking through
[12533.66 --> 12541.66]  uh pictures of um like computer stuff in my in my gallery uh like in my my photo archive for an
[12541.66 --> 12548.38]  upcoming uh linus or linus's team reacts to linus's old computers by the way you should almost certainly
[12548.38 --> 12552.78]  be one of the reactors because you haven't seen most of the janky stuff i've done i'm super down yeah
[12552.78 --> 12561.42]  um anywho i came across an image of um one of my daughters uh oh here can i borrow that for a sec
[12561.98 --> 12567.34]  okay you know how uh these pillows often have a strap i came across an image of one of my daughters
[12567.34 --> 12573.58]  uh while people were playing vr in the background wearing one of these like a vr headset and i was like
[12574.14 --> 12580.46]  oh my god we should do a vr headset plushie so we're gonna do that now that's funny so sometimes
[12580.46 --> 12586.46]  it's just like a flash of inspiration like that sometimes it's my ongoing yeah right no tell me
[12586.46 --> 12596.14]  something should it have plushie wands or no i don't think so oh but it's kind of like that yeah
[12596.14 --> 12600.22]  what if i kind of what if you want to kind of pose it on a shelf would you have the plushie wands next
[12600.22 --> 12604.70]  to it yeah actually i think so i was when i said no i was thinking about it more as a pillow
[12605.82 --> 12610.22]  sure i was like i feel like that'd be no it's not a pillow it's wearable more yeah it's like it's a it's
[12610.22 --> 12615.58]  kind of like then i feel like because yeah you'd hold the ones yeah yeah yeah yeah um so anyway uh
[12615.58 --> 12619.66]  and then sometimes i'm just like really frustrated by the existing solution and i want a better one
[12619.66 --> 12623.26]  like i was so tired of the stupid snap on bit storage i was like no no no no no
[12625.42 --> 12629.82]  no there must be a better way this is ridiculous i want a new backpack
[12631.34 --> 12637.74]  i did want a new backpack i know i know i wanted a new backpack that one actually was really championed by
[12637.74 --> 12643.02]  bridgette though because like i wanted a new backpack and i was like willing to pay for a new backpack
[12643.58 --> 12648.22]  like the whole development of a new backpack um but i didn't have the confidence that we could
[12649.10 --> 12657.18]  that we could make it happen and she was like look let me try i'm like okay it's your funeral she was
[12657.18 --> 12665.02]  like super new at the time like yeah okay you can waste your time but like i'd really rather you were working on these things that have like a clear
[12665.02 --> 12671.42]  a clear a clear path to a great roi and then backpack has outperformed probably everything else she ever did combined
[12671.98 --> 12676.94]  which which is i'm not saying that those other things were bad i'm just saying she was clear she made the right call good yeah
[12676.94 --> 12683.18]  yeah um christian says luke since you play tarkov and elder scrolls have you looked at dark and darker
[12683.18 --> 12690.78]  yeah uh i haven't had enough time to jump into like the play tests and whatever else they've done recently
[12690.78 --> 12699.50]  um but yeah i mean you you kind of nailed it the the internet sphere of knowledge about me figured out
[12699.50 --> 12704.86]  that that would probably make sense for me and has just sent a deluge of information about it at me just
[12704.86 --> 12711.26]  various videos and google news things and whatever else have all hit my feeds um so i'm aware of it and uh
[12711.90 --> 12715.98]  i'm sure i'll try it out at some point but i haven't tried it out yet looks really interesting
[12717.02 --> 12723.02]  it's it's i suspect it's gonna be one of those games that are just like perpetually in in beta um but i
[12723.02 --> 12728.70]  hope that it hits a stable release or a stable playable state at some point at the very least
[12728.70 --> 12733.42]  because i know right now it's like kind of sometimes available and sometimes not i don't know yeah
[12733.42 --> 12739.18]  gregory asks hey linus will the lab have an api with clear rules uh that will allow us to make our own
[12739.18 --> 12744.54]  chrome plugins uh i mean it really depends on what you would expect your chrome plugins to do
[12745.50 --> 12751.90]  no third party whatever um i i i'm a reference earlier in the show yeah i'm legitimately just not
[12751.90 --> 12758.86]  exactly sure what a third party uh plugin would do like i mean that shopping comparison one i yeah it
[12758.86 --> 12768.14]  could be third party um i don't know unless we api access for like a data set is like
[12769.82 --> 12776.54]  yeah a paid feature yeah um from my point of view like if you are an individual user interacting with a
[12776.54 --> 12782.54]  website to learn about you know products or help you build a computer or whatever else um i'm of the
[12782.54 --> 12790.30]  mind that that should uh should be basically free um we can give you a big solid maybe yeah advertisements
[12790.30 --> 12795.02]  uh maybe you know affiliates almost certainly like there are ways we're going to monetize
[12795.02 --> 12800.86]  that kind of interaction but i don't i don't want us to basically just go you know oh you who needs to
[12800.86 --> 12806.62]  build a computer once every five years we expect you to pay a monthly subscription like i i i just
[12806.62 --> 12815.58]  don't really that doesn't seem like a viable um way of engaging with with users um whereas if you are
[12815.58 --> 12820.70]  yeah if you're if you're building it like some kind of comparison engine tool that integrates into amazon
[12820.70 --> 12829.10]  like i mean i i don't think anyone would even expect that kind of access to the database to be free so i i
[12829.10 --> 12838.14]  don't know i don't know what this is going to look like yeah solid maybe uh last one oh there's two
[12839.02 --> 12844.86]  um caleb asks have you considered adding a gym for employees to use we technically have one it doesn't
[12844.86 --> 12852.06]  have equipment in it uh that could change that'd be great um basically what i was kind of thinking is
[12852.06 --> 12858.86]  when the real badminton center opens there would be no reason to have like a badminton court in the gym
[12858.86 --> 12863.50]  so i was kind of thinking of just like shoving some equipment in it i'm deeply concerned about
[12863.50 --> 12868.38]  liability though liability is a big problem because i have no way of supervising and knowing if people
[12868.38 --> 12872.94]  are using it properly and if someone like like you know breaks their knee the wrong way or whatever
[12872.94 --> 12879.02]  else in it i i there's there's no first aid attendant there's no um so it's possible it won't happen
[12879.02 --> 12885.18]  there are there have to be ways because there are 24-hour fitness centers where you just like badge into
[12885.18 --> 12889.82]  them and there's nobody working there at the time but i don't know what the way is the way might be
[12889.82 --> 12894.70]  that they're just rolling the dice could be sometimes that actually is the answer could be
[12894.70 --> 12899.74]  yeah i hope it's not because this sounds amazing and i would personally love it and use it all the time
[12899.74 --> 12906.22]  um but like i use it as it is every week liability is terrifying but a lot of the stuff that i
[12906.78 --> 12911.90]  yeah doing not everyone could you'd need equipment i get it yeah um and you would need equipment
[12911.90 --> 12917.10]  that would be sketchy from a liability standpoint and even if i went with someone because it's like
[12917.10 --> 12922.22]  something i would want to do with a spotter or whatever they're not in a uh they're not going
[12922.22 --> 12928.30]  to be like hired by your gym to be responsible for whatever so like there's still liability it
[12928.30 --> 12933.42]  doesn't help the liability problems at all actually yeah um so you know what i think i'm kind of talked
[12933.42 --> 12941.02]  out of it no no it's not happening sorry we'll make that a uh uh maybe so thanks for tuning into the
[12941.02 --> 12943.42]  wang show we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
