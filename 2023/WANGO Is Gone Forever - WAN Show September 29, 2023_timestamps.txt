On the topic of CS 2 (I am adding things as I watch and will post when the topic has finished)

I really like CS 2. The gunplay feels solid and satisfying although I'm sure that will fade over time, the graphics improvements of Source 2 are phenomenal although only if compared to the original Source and the map remakes are as much as a fresh new look as they are genuine improvements to playability and visuals.
- r_cleardecals is gone and I hate that. This removed decals such as bullet impacts and blood from walls and the keybind (I used X) is built in to my muscle memory.
- As a mid-high silver, it was surprising for me to be keeping up with 
- The smokes are amazing and I really like the slightly more dynamic approach. Some places feel much easier to smoke as it seems to fill the gaps instead of seeming like they are disappearing through walls whereas some places feel much harder to effectively smoke, especially with the less defined edges. This does however mean that they are way more predictable as to whether they can see you and you can see them.
- I love sub-tick although not because of how it feels (I'm not good enough to judge that) but just by how it works. The timestamp system with the server still running 64 tick while still having the issue of only calculating all states 64 times a second, it is now being told exactly when a player pressed the key/button, meaning a much fairer method of computing the game state even if clients might not see the right thing for like 0.015625 seconds.
- It should be noted that this is not a complete game and we should expect it to be updated regularly during this early stage, fixing more bugs and balance adjustments etc.
Valve will most likely then start working on adding either revamped old things or new things.

About BG3 Annoyances (timestamp 46:00). I feel the "problems" talked about are features and not bugs. You are not supposed to win every dice roll and a part of the game is trying to figure out what choices to pick before it's presented to you. Your team needs to talk to a shade character, then the rogue might have special conversation options so lets send that one. Or you might get the option to deceive, persuade or intimidate an Ogre. In the conversation it says you have no bonus to any option, so they all look equal, but they are not. You need to roll a 5 to deceive the ogre, but a 15 to intimidate. You don't know that until you pick your choice, but if you stop and think it makes sense that the Ogre is easier to deceive than to intimidate. Feature, not a bug.
