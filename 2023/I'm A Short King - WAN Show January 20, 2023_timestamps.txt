[2023-02-02T04:33:38Z] Video: I'm A Short King - WAN Show January 20, 2023 
What was the result of last week's "demonetize this" episode? Did Linus talk about it? I've watched the 2 episodes since and didn't pick up on anything. Did I miss it? Does anyone know? I really don't wanna watch through 6+ hours of wan show again just to see if it was mentioned. I've looked through the timestamps

1:18:55 That's what you're doing wrong. I would never imagine myself sitting down to watch the WAN show. I always put it on on my headphones as I do random stuff around the house. I always want to watch something else if I happen to not have anything to do and the show is still playing. I like to see what's on screen when you show something specific (or I suspect either of you are silently emoting, it's always fun to see those reaction moments). Otherwise this is purely an audio podcast for me, and a great one. I _understand_ why people like "the timestamp guy", but I couldn't care less he didn't exist personally.

You actually have timestamps now wow, welcome to 2015 ohh wait. 
Btw why you got 10 editor's?

1:19:08 I love the timestamp guy <3
Even if I'm watching the whole vod versus specific clips, the timestamps let me accurately jump back to a previous topic, or, if I watch part of the vod and come back and don't remember where I was, I can use the timestamps.

For me, I don't want to buy something without seeing it some form, and there's a risk that it's wrong. And the current focus of AI feels way to targeted at "direct" interactions/shortcuts: play this song, buy this DVD, take me to work, etc.

So if I'm hypothetically like "Hey Google, order Cat Food", I have no idea if it will be smart and order food off my purchasing history or if it will buy 50lbs of the shittiest cat food.

Something I would like to see is if product codes for inventory were more universalized (like produce cashier codes are). So if I buy something with a credit card from multiple places (like cat food for example), my assistant would know exactly what I buy and get it. Like imagine if the codes for groceries were universal, so when you buy food you can see it just pop up in a pantry app. And then imagine if you had a scanner by the garbage where you could scan the bar code when you throw away the packaging. So now you don't have to do an inventory of your pantry before going to a store. So if I'm just coming home from work and stop on a whim, I can know through my phone whether I have/need some random spice like corriander or whatever.

You could even have the pantry app have timestamps of when you bought things, and have it scape the web for ways to use unused ingredients before they expire. I feel like that would cut down on food waste, while also being a way to monetize the app and have the population explore other/healthier food options.

That's the type of AI I'd like to see, rather than some very direct interaction like "Play a song"

But yeah I don't like engaging with salesman, I'd rather just look up options.

Who said longer is better?!!!
Well, I will wait for the timestamp guy, no way in hell I gonna watch 3 and half hour XD

[2023-01-21T17:51:03Z] Video: I'm A Short King - WAN Show January 20, 2023 
1:18:39 ...and then i'm like... whyyyy am i watching this?? hahaha     1:19:06 timestamp guy! :P

[2023-01-21T17:02:21Z] Video: I'm A Short King - WAN Show January 20, 2023 
1:18:50 One other thing is that linking people timestamped links on YouTube is a bit hit or miss, because in the past it has sometimes not worked in embedded players in texts and even now the video will start without audio, so they might miss the actual part while unmuting, or they’ll unmute and then rewind to the beginning without realizing it was a timestamp link. Or they’ll click, see it’s a 3 hour video and say, “Oh, I’m not watching that now.”

Plus it can serve as the gateway drug, so people see a short clip and think, “Sure, I’ve got 5 minutes,” and then they’re left wanting more, so they go on to either more clips or the full episode.

[2023-01-21T16:28:06Z] Video: I'm A Short King - WAN Show January 20, 2023 
I love watching the WAN show, but we need the timestamps. I can skip to interesting headings, so in essence I much more enjoy watching it as a series of clips (lightly editorialised by the timestamp title), than as a whole show, bc about 1/3 of the topics and most merch messages i dont care about .

[2023-01-21T14:16:45Z] Video: I'm A Short King - WAN Show January 20, 2023 
1:19:15 Timestamp guy is a hero

[2023-01-21T12:59:15Z] Video: I'm A Short King - WAN Show January 20, 2023 
Timestamp guy, timestamp guy
Always on the WAN Show, never shy
With his trusty keyboard by his side
He'd timestamp every moment with pride

Chorus:
But this week, oh what a shame
Timestamp guy's on vacation, no more timestamps to claim
We miss his handy work, it's true
Timestamp guy, we're waiting for you

Verse 2:
We scroll through the comments with a sigh
No timestamps, it feels like we're running dry
We only need the times when they're hard to find
Only miss the timestamps when they're not there to remind

Chorus:
But this week, oh what a shame
Timestamp guy's on vacation, no more timestamps to claim
We miss his handy work, it's true
Timestamp guy, we're waiting for you

Verse 3:
Staring at the bottom of our screens
Hoping one day he'll come back it seems
But time goes slow and he's gone so fast
We see him when we close our eyes
Maybe one day we'll understand why
Everything he touched was so precise

Chorus:
But this week, oh what a shame
Timestamp guy's on vacation, no more timestamps to claim
We miss his handy work, it's true
Timestamp guy, we're waiting for you

Outro:
Cause you only need the timestamps when they're hard to find
Only miss the timestamps when they're not there to remind
Only know you love Timestamp guy when he's not on your mind
And you let him go.

LTT has almost 100 employees and no one can make timestamps?

[2023-01-21T09:05:22Z] Video: I'm A Short King - WAN Show January 20, 2023 
Every other Friday I work a 12 hour night shift. You best believe I listen to WAN show as I do my job, but when Im free on Fridays not so much I need timestamp guy lol.

@NoKi1119(timestamp guy)  don't worry and take your time as this is one of the biggest Wan show.

[2023-01-21T05:32:27Z] Video: I'm A Short King - WAN Show January 20, 2023 
@NoKi1119 (timestamp guy) has a big challenge on his hands, timestamping possibly the longest WAN show ever! 

Keep up the good work 👍
