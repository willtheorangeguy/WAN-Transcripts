The proper solution to the fact checking would probably be videos coming out on Floatplane like a day before they come out on YT and implementing a timestamped ticket system that groups all reports within like 2-5 seconds into the same error/issue/correction and then issuing one or more people that led to a correction like a $5 LTT store gift card. Either first come first serve or first three or just randomly raffle it off to everyone that reported that error within that timestamp range. You already likely have a somewhat captive and knowledgable more attentive base that might be incentivised by essentially a store credit and the timestamp thing makes it clear to see exactly where the error might be. Might be worth some extra development on the backend instead of hiring on site fact checkers, rewards people for finding mistakes and brings them back to your store Company Town style lol.
