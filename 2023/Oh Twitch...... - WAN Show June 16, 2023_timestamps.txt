I have watched the wan show for many many year, and every week i listen to this in my car, and every week i wonder why the over all volume of the show has to be so low, that even on max volume, i can barely hear it in the car. Any other video, ears bleed. Why is this?

The capacitor water bottle should have RE LTTSTOR and the capacity value running up the rest of the sides in slightly bleeding font, just like actual aluminum electrolytic capacitors. Bonus points if you add electrolytic sports drink powder with the order.

Day after day I'm still infuriated by streamers claiming twitch is shit and going to kick. Like wtf, of course streamers are providing the content that makes the platform attractive. But that doesnt mean Twitch should obey their requests.

Intel branding's choice is purely intentional. I suspect partly due to wanting to confuse people. And the other aspect is as short of improvements to the same generation I don't think they're going to improve generation over generation anymore so you're just going to have generation 13 rev 1 generation 13 rev 2 so let's just remove the name generation and call it ultra this rev one or rev2

So the Duracell battery in Pikmin makes a bit of sense... the planet that you explore in the Pikmin games is Earth or a version of it. So seeing remnants of human kind is atleast believable.

Amazon fucked up with Prime subs. When they added it they intended to pay creators less because of course they had to, but at the time people could only sub once so that meant that meant that potentaly most chatters would be on prime sub which would have been a gigantic pay cut to creators. This wouldn't have been such a big issue today with giftsubbing being such a big thing. Amazon's solution to just eat it with Prime subs was even worse because now they can't remove prime subs and not look like gigantic assholes. 

YouTube for all it's issues has at least made a payment structure that actually makes money. Hopefully they'll also be able to upgrade their streaming and chatting features over time to match competitors better, but even if they don't they at least make money.

It's been 6 hours and timestamp guy is nowhere to be seen

[2023-06-17T07:30:03Z] Video: Oh Twitch...... - WAN Show June 16, 2023 
What's up today? Timestamp guy is missing, but the CCs are still there (typically they get removed within an hour and reappear a day or two later, sometimes even 3 or 4. And the whole thing is just 144p garbage, but at least I can listen.
