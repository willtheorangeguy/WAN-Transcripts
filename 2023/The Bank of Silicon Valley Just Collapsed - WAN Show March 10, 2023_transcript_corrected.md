[0.80 → 7.60] Welcome to the WAN show. We have got a great show for you guys this week. Breaking news! Breaking news!
[7.60 → 11.20] Like what is this like two hours ago? Three hours ago or something like that?
[11.20 → 12.00] Three or four, yeah.
[12.00 → 12.80] Yeah!
[12.80 → 18.80] Uh, SVB, the Silicon Valley Bank goes under? What? What? Bank?
[19.60 → 23.20] Just gone? In Silicon Valley? This is wild!
[23.20 → 32.70] Less wild is that YouTube has apparently relaxed their stupid f***ING profanity policy, I'm still bleeping it anyway.
[32.70 → 33.20] Not a hundred percent.
[33.20 → 36.40] Some people complained about that WAN show. What else we got going on today?
[36.40 → 42.50] Ring gives police invasive user footage including sometimes of inside their house.
[42.50 → 43.00] Cool!
[43.00 → 46.40] Even without a warrant. Just if they like, if they feel like they want it.
[46.40 → 46.90] Good job Ring!
[46.90 → 49.40] Yeah. Uh, oh, what else?
[49.40 → 51.90] Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[51.90 → 52.40] Really Luke?
[52.40 → 59.08] Just because I get to go first and pick all the best topics means that you sit here, and I don't see anything else I want to talk about.
[59.12 → 60.06] Think about it for this one.
[60.06 → 60.70] Sounds good.
[61.44 → 63.14] Trust me, there will be stuff.
[64.24 → 64.52] Seriously?
[65.42 → 66.38] What would you pick?
[66.52 → 70.54] There's something in here that was in here last week, but we've also talked about it like three times, so I don't know.
[70.76 → 71.54] All right, intro!
[82.40 → 96.56] The show is brought to you by FreshBooks, Goliath Technologies.
[96.94 → 97.68] I heard they're online.
[98.06 → 98.66] Squarespace.
[100.80 → 101.32] Really?
[101.48 → 102.20] Okay, Markov.
[102.36 → 103.82] Why not that for the fourth topic?
[104.80 → 106.26] Luke's got some Markov updates.
[106.40 → 106.94] It's spicy.
[106.94 → 107.38] Yeah.
[107.60 → 111.72] First, we need to get into the big news this week.
[112.54 → 113.62] Sources for this.
[113.76 → 114.18] I don't know.
[114.24 → 114.66] Everywhere.
[114.88 → 117.10] CTV, the BBC, Clockworks.
[117.28 → 118.00] Doesn't matter.
[118.10 → 128.12] The point is, earlier today, the 16th largest bank in America, which, if you were a Canadian, doesn't sound like that big of a deal.
[128.74 → 132.00] Because here in Canada, we only have like four banks.
[132.14 → 135.12] We're also smaller than California in regard to population.
[135.36 → 137.56] Yeah, so it wouldn't be a huge deal here.
[137.56 → 140.26] In America, 16th largest bank?
[140.92 → 141.44] What?
[142.60 → 143.28] Okay.
[143.50 → 147.94] So they suffered a good old-fashioned 1930s-style bank run.
[148.16 → 155.00] And the tense of its Wikipedia page went from is to was.
[155.00 → 161.16] There was some indication earlier this week that the bank might not have sufficient liquid assets.
[161.16 → 164.62] The stock price of its parent company dropped suddenly.
[165.02 → 168.64] Venture capitalists advised their clients to withdraw funds.
[169.06 → 173.66] And those clients rushed to get out what they could until regulators stepped in.
[173.66 → 179.30] This is the largest American bank collapse since the 2008 financial crisis.
[179.30 → 181.68] Now, here's the thing.
[181.68 → 189.22] Under normal circumstances, we wouldn't really be reporting on a bank failure in the U.S.
[189.22 → 192.98] Because it's kind of a big deal, but it's not really tech.
[193.14 → 193.30] Yeah.
[193.30 → 198.80] Except that SVB stands for Silicon Valley Bank.
[199.52 → 202.30] So let's talk about that.
[202.68 → 211.42] The liquidity issues that they suffered were heavily exacerbated by inflation, interest hikes, and the overall weakness of, here it comes, the tech markets.
[211.42 → 215.70] As SVB specialized in lending to tech startups.
[215.94 → 221.96] And most depositors were tech workers and VC-backed companies.
[221.96 → 228.74] Much of the bank's deposits, and this is wild, were uninsured.
[228.98 → 233.50] Now, this is not in our notes, so you guys will have to forgive me if I've got the exact details wrong.
[233.56 → 239.94] But my understanding is that deposits were insured up to a maximum of $250,000.
[240.44 → 241.06] I believe so.
[241.42 → 250.54] Now, this is something that is, you know, from a, I would say from an individual standpoint, very much a first world problem.
[250.54 → 262.02] But most banks that I'm aware of do, in fact, have a limit to how much your balance can be before it just goes beyond what their insurance will cover.
[262.52 → 272.36] And in the event of a bank run or insolvency or other kind of, hey, poof, the money's gone event, it is simply not covered.
[272.52 → 273.54] It is irrecoverable.
[273.54 → 286.80] So there's, so the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC.gov, says that standard deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor per insured bank for each account ownership category.
[287.16 → 289.54] So $250,000 is insured by government.
[290.70 → 291.06] So.
[291.32 → 293.68] But companies, on company scale.
[293.86 → 294.14] Yes.
[294.26 → 294.98] $250,000.
[295.10 → 296.08] I was getting to that.
[296.18 → 297.20] Is small.
[297.20 → 299.90] From an individual standpoint, right?
[300.32 → 300.54] Lots.
[300.54 → 301.58] Oh, I'm sorry.
[301.94 → 307.66] Your $251,000 is not fully covered in your bank account?
[308.18 → 309.26] Boo hoo.
[309.56 → 310.40] Cry me a river.
[310.40 → 311.62] You sell $250,000.
[311.92 → 312.76] You're a person, whatever.
[312.90 → 313.72] That's tons of money.
[313.84 → 315.26] That's a lot of money to have in the bank.
[315.66 → 316.98] But let me tell you something.
[317.34 → 321.14] From a business standpoint, look around you, okay?
[321.56 → 321.76] Right?
[321.94 → 322.68] Do the math.
[322.82 → 323.86] How many people work here?
[323.86 → 326.56] I think we're over 100 now.
[326.82 → 327.70] We're close to it.
[327.74 → 330.22] Does anyone know what, like, minimum wage is here?
[331.00 → 333.12] In B, we don't pay minimum wage.
[333.14 → 335.14] I know, but, like, I'm doing, like, uh.
[335.14 → 335.16] In BC?
[335.34 → 336.32] I think it's, like, 14.
[336.40 → 336.88] Let me look it up.
[337.24 → 337.52] Okay.
[337.76 → 338.02] Okay.
[338.10 → 339.26] So we've got 100 people.
[339.86 → 340.14] Okay.
[340.52 → 341.80] $1565 per hour.
[341.86 → 342.26] Times 50.
[342.26 → 345.68] So let's assume that we paid minimum wage, which we don't.
[346.08 → 346.34] Okay.
[346.38 → 351.76] So that would be $1,565 per hour.
[351.76 → 354.42] Uh, what does that work out to in a work week?
[354.46 → 356.32] Let's say everyone was working 40 hours.
[356.44 → 357.90] We have, we have full-time employees.
[357.90 → 359.44] We're just doing this math live here.
[359.54 → 366.98] That would be $62,600 per work week, which is only half of a pay period.
[367.14 → 368.08] So times two.
[368.90 → 375.78] Assuming, assuming that we paid minimum wage, which, again, we do not.
[376.16 → 379.94] That would be $125,000 per pay period.
[379.94 → 381.54] Not including all other expenses.
[381.96 → 383.72] Not including all other expenses.
[383.94 → 388.74] Not including the fact that we, no, in fact, do not pay anyone here minimum wage.
[389.08 → 396.80] Not including the fact that you should have more than one freaking pay period in your bank account at a time.
[396.80 → 397.04] Yeah.
[397.04 → 418.02] So in the event that our company, say, were to experience an event like this, where right now, anyone with their deposits and SVB, if they didn't get them out already, and even if they did get them out, if they sent, if they, if they withdrew money via a wire, like they sent out a wire, there is no guarantee.
[418.02 → 426.14] Now that the bank has, my understanding is it's simply been seized by the federal government or something like that.
[426.28 → 426.72] I don't know.
[426.94 → 427.46] Yeah.
[427.60 → 433.36] So sorry for any little details here, but effectively its assets are under control by a third party now.
[433.36 → 439.06] If that money simply does not come out, it's gone.
[441.20 → 449.04] Now, there is, so if that were to happen here, we would just be out whatever was in that float account.
[449.58 → 452.76] At least temporarily when you have bills to pay and salaries to fulfill.
[452.76 → 453.28] Exactly.
[453.28 → 466.64] Because if you factor in that this is a bank that specializes in startups where they are theoretically putting their VC raised money that they are running off of.
[467.86 → 470.82] This is, this is highly operational funds.
[470.90 → 471.04] Yeah.
[471.06 → 471.84] This is wild.
[472.10 → 476.52] This could be, this could be even if, even a profitable company.
[476.74 → 477.02] Okay.
[477.30 → 479.06] We are a profitable company.
[479.06 → 490.02] But if you took our operating capital and just, even if you didn't eliminate it, if you froze it indefinitely, how do we run?
[490.58 → 490.70] Yeah.
[490.90 → 495.50] How do I pay for whatever services you're logged in?
[495.56 → 496.00] Float plane.
[496.30 → 497.74] How do I, how do I pay the bill?
[497.98 → 499.00] How do I pay you?
[499.34 → 502.00] How do I, how do I pay that guy?
[503.72 → 504.20] Right?
[504.34 → 506.64] Look how sad he would be if he didn't get any money.
[509.06 → 511.18] This is, this is wild.
[512.00 → 513.54] Um, and you know what?
[513.58 → 517.46] It's, it's one of those things where it's something that Yvonne and I have actually talked about.
[517.60 → 522.92] In Canada, the banking industry is fairly well regulated, pretty solid.
[523.16 → 526.14] During 2008, we kind of survived stuff like that.
[526.16 → 527.44] We were pretty steady up here.
[527.90 → 532.78] Um, but I can tell you guys from my own research that the limit.
[532.78 → 541.44] So we used to bank with a credit union specifically because there was no, um, government imposed limit on how much they could insure.
[541.66 → 543.38] That was, that was the reason we did it.
[543.44 → 555.34] So we could have a million dollars or two million dollars or three million dollars sitting in the bank as our, as our operating funds or to cover upcoming deposits or expenses for merch or whatever else it is.
[555.34 → 564.10] We could have that sitting there knowing that in the event that something went catastrophically wrong, it would be covered by insurance, and we would get it back.
[564.34 → 565.84] But that actually changed.
[565.94 → 568.28] I think about a year ago, it was in the last year or two.
[568.34 → 569.16] I know that for sure.
[569.64 → 580.30] Um, and so I have to be honest with you, you, um, we ha we are pretty much in the same situation.
[580.30 → 585.44] Oh, just, but, but not with, with, if this happened to the bank that you're with.
[585.88 → 590.48] And so reading about this as a business owner is absolutely terrifying.
[590.68 → 591.38] It's petrifying.
[591.56 → 591.68] Yeah.
[592.18 → 597.84] I would, I would basically roll into the office and just like, I just sit there.
[598.00 → 599.56] What can I do?
[599.62 → 601.44] How do you run a business with no capital?
[601.44 → 613.92] And now it is possible that, uh, uh, that, uh, a sale of SVB, and it's, and it's assets and its liabilities presumably, um, could be negotiated.
[614.14 → 625.08] But I pretty much promise you that whatever those, um, whatever cash it owes, if you get anything back from it, it's going to be less than a hundred percent.
[625.08 → 628.88] Like they're going to negotiate some reduced payout.
[629.02 → 634.48] And you don't know which part of the queue you're going to be in, in regard to people that get their money first.
[635.46 → 637.06] So like, yeah, yeah.
[637.06 → 638.98] That, well, that was a whole thing that happened.
[639.10 → 645.82] Uh, we saw with the NCI bankruptcy where depending on where you were in the chain of creditors.
[645.92 → 646.18] Yeah.
[646.18 → 655.52] Even if they extracted any money from the, from the shareholders who turned tail and ran away, it was never going to make it to you.
[655.54 → 658.62] And like the lawyers or whatever, Holdco is currently dealing with the sale and stuff.
[658.76 → 660.16] They're going to want their cut too.
[660.52 → 660.78] Yeah.
[660.88 → 661.06] Yeah.
[661.06 → 663.68] They get paid no matter what, which is fascinating to me.
[663.90 → 664.00] Yeah.
[664.14 → 664.48] Yeah.
[664.60 → 667.36] So like there's some, there's some funky stuff.
[667.86 → 669.40] It's, it's going to be interesting.
[669.40 → 669.72] Yeah.
[669.86 → 672.94] Top Gear 1224 says 100% honest.
[673.18 → 675.22] This is why companies use stocks as bank accounts.
[675.22 → 676.14] Not just stocks.
[676.28 → 679.64] So I was recently made aware of something called a land bank.
[679.66 → 680.18] A land bank.
[680.32 → 680.46] Yeah.
[680.80 → 693.78] Uh, so here in Vancouver where real estate generally does one thing and goes like this, though not necessarily the case lately as, um, some of the folks here who have been, who have been on the market can attest to.
[693.92 → 702.18] And also I can attest to as someone who bought at the peak, uh, the lab, I get reports from our commercial realtor every once in a while.
[702.26 → 703.12] Prices are going down.
[703.22 → 703.64] It's exciting.
[703.64 → 704.22] I'm sitting here going.
[705.22 → 705.40] Yeah.
[705.40 → 706.58] It doesn't help my mortgage, bro.
[707.74 → 708.18] Anyway.
[709.56 → 710.78] Um, where was I going?
[710.82 → 711.00] Right.
[711.34 → 717.72] Uh, the concept of a land bank is that you just buy land because cash.
[718.10 → 719.02] Like, okay.
[719.02 → 724.18] This is something that Yvonne and I were talking about recently.
[724.18 → 728.12] The concept of like investments being risky, right?
[728.44 → 730.18] Investments carry an inherent risk.
[730.18 → 734.60] So buying something like the lab, something that, an investment that has gone down, right?
[734.98 → 736.96] Um, an investment carries risk.
[736.96 → 739.06] And it's like, yes, that's true.
[739.46 → 744.94] But literally every asset class can be seen as an investment on some level.
[745.14 → 745.24] Yeah.
[745.24 → 746.84] Like here, here's something interesting.
[747.10 → 753.10] Did you know that the Canadian dollar has lost five cents to the U.S. dollar in the last three weeks?
[753.10 → 755.16] I know that because I saw it on your screen, but.
[755.24 → 755.38] Right.
[755.56 → 755.74] Yeah.
[755.74 → 763.30] So the mere act of having cash in the bank not invested is an investment.
[763.82 → 764.88] A good one.
[765.00 → 768.12] Well, with inflation being what it is, I would say no.
[768.26 → 770.14] But it is certainly an investment.
[770.40 → 776.96] So, so this is where the concept of a land bank was introduced to me where it was kind of like, well, here's the thing.
[776.96 → 778.94] You actually can't trust cash.
[779.20 → 781.00] Gold kind of sucks these days.
[781.54 → 782.36] Uh, what, crypto?
[782.68 → 783.64] I mean, sure.
[783.82 → 785.98] If you like riding the roller coaster, baby.
[786.72 → 792.98] Um, so that's why a lot of wealthy people just put their assets into land.
[793.24 → 798.48] Because, and this is, this is the way, uh, the person explaining it to me, uh, explained it.
[798.60 → 801.22] They were like, well, here's the thing about land.
[801.30 → 802.46] They're not making more of it.
[802.90 → 805.86] I mean, Dubai would have something to say about that, I suppose.
[805.86 → 807.72] But in general.
[808.14 → 809.04] Most places are.
[809.22 → 809.32] Yeah.
[809.32 → 810.90] In general, they're not making more of it.
[810.94 → 811.12] Right.
[811.46 → 821.78] And so I, um, uh, this, the, the, coming back to sort of the reason for having this conversation, we're already looking around the lab going, holy crap, we're going to run out of space in this place.
[822.34 → 832.74] And I had wanted to explore the idea of, I don't know, renting the unit next door or in the long term, you know, because my understanding is there's a long term tenant there now.
[832.74 → 840.84] So I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, maybe if we could scrape together a down payment between now and when that lease expires, maybe we could acquire that.
[841.00 → 850.36] And I was informed that the owner is using it as a land bank and is therefore utterly uninterested in selling it because they aren't looking to profit.
[850.36 → 852.86] They're looking for a safe haven for their money.
[853.14 → 853.16] Yeah.
[853.48 → 858.26] And based on this SVB news, that's not crazy.
[858.64 → 858.80] Yeah.
[858.80 → 862.28] That's just, that's just sound financial planning.
[862.28 → 869.00] Apparently when your just like have $10 million that you don't want to just disappear because there was a bank run.
[870.28 → 872.74] Um, any who, sorry.
[872.90 → 876.64] I, I went off on a bit of a tangent there, but this is mind-blowing.
[876.78 → 881.14] This also is going to be quite the developing story over the last little while.
[881.14 → 888.40] I, I just Googled companies with cash stuck in SVB because we've had a bunch of people mention ROK, right?
[888.42 → 898.12] So we haven't said it on, on this part of the show yet, but ROK has 26% of its cash stuck in SVB, which as far as my understanding goes right now is $487 million.
[898.94 → 900.58] I don't know what's more surprising.
[900.58 → 907.92] The fact that they have $487 million stuck in SVB or the fact that they have almost $2 billion in cash.
[907.96 → 908.66] ROK really?
[909.00 → 909.04] Yeah.
[909.20 → 909.56] Crazy.
[909.78 → 910.34] Go figure.
[910.34 → 911.54] ROK be balling.
[911.54 → 912.18] They're doing good.
[912.18 → 912.48] Apparently.
[912.76 → 913.46] In cash.
[913.64 → 913.88] Yeah.
[914.22 → 914.66] Dang.
[914.66 → 917.04] How many people does even work at ROK?
[917.34 → 919.04] We'll see moving forward.
[921.40 → 921.92] Yeah.
[922.12 → 929.98] I don't want to joke about that, but Googling this, uh, the top stories thing on Google, there's a post from two hours ago.
[930.12 → 934.62] There's a post from one hour ago and there's a post from 10 minutes ago.
[934.78 → 938.98] This is very, very much a currently developing story.
[938.98 → 940.34] There is some cool stuff.
[940.34 → 948.26] There are some white knights already showing up, even though it's been like literally hours, um, like Tercel linear, some other companies.
[948.26 → 952.04] I know this because I'm just creeping Fiot3's Twitter.
[952.04 → 960.38] Um, but these companies are stepping up and saying like, if you are a customer of ours, and you're impacted by this, like reach out, we might be able to help you.
[960.38 → 961.84] I don't know who you're calling.
[962.30 → 971.16] Um, there's, there's even like, some of them are talking about, okay, we can, we can suspend like we are delay payments while you figure out your accounting.
[971.16 → 974.50] Like some companies are being very cool about it.
[974.86 → 979.68] Um, but yeah, this is going to be, this is going to be quite yikes for a while.
[979.80 → 980.76] I don't know what I want to get into.
[980.94 → 983.82] Hey, uh, your money is not an SVB, is it?
[983.82 → 987.00] Oh, I think I know who this is.
[987.00 → 988.00] Uh, SVB?
[988.68 → 990.16] Uh, Silicon Valley Bank?
[990.44 → 991.06] It's Linus.
[995.64 → 999.08] No, no, I just mean like, like you, like you guys don't keep your money there, right?
[999.16 → 1000.02] Silicon Valley Bank?
[1000.98 → 1002.40] Okay, just checking.
[1003.88 → 1004.62] You're with Chase.
[1005.08 → 1005.42] Cool.
[1005.64 → 1007.64] Oh yeah, SVB experienced a bank run.
[1007.70 → 1008.96] They're like gone, essentially.
[1010.66 → 1012.72] Yeah, I guess you haven't been on the internet in the last few hours.
[1012.72 → 1013.78] Anyway, I'm live on WAN show.
[1013.84 → 1014.34] I got to go.
[1016.88 → 1017.68] All right, later.
[1017.98 → 1018.34] Okay, bye.
[1019.40 → 1019.80] Cool.
[1019.96 → 1021.92] Is this that company you invested in?
[1021.92 → 1022.86] This is the NAS.
[1023.16 → 1023.86] Yeah, I thought so.
[1023.88 → 1028.52] This is the NAS software company that I literally wrote a check to like a month ago.
[1028.58 → 1029.30] What about Framework?
[1029.82 → 1030.66] I don't know.
[1031.14 → 1033.14] And if I did know, I wouldn't be able to say anything.
[1033.44 → 1040.64] But this is the one that I was most worried about because these guys are very much in like stealth mode right now.
[1040.64 → 1040.92] Yeah.
[1040.92 → 1043.18] They have absolute, like Framework has cash flow.
[1043.56 → 1044.52] They're selling laptops.
[1044.66 → 1045.22] That helps a lot.
[1045.58 → 1047.32] You can refill the coffers.
[1047.36 → 1048.12] That helps a lot.
[1048.28 → 1050.58] See, okay, actually, you know what?
[1050.68 → 1053.74] It occurs to me that Linus Media Group would probably be okay.
[1053.88 → 1055.64] Because we could borrow from Creator Warehouse.
[1056.04 → 1058.94] Where we have consistent cash coming in.
[1059.34 → 1061.36] Linus Media Group, I mean, think about it.
[1061.54 → 1063.68] Many of our customers are probably impacted.
[1064.18 → 1064.40] Yep.
[1064.40 → 1066.60] So, oh crap.
[1066.72 → 1067.46] Yeah, that's not good.
[1067.90 → 1069.78] Oh, I got to talk to accounting.
[1070.58 → 1071.46] Oh, balls.
[1071.58 → 1075.24] Anyway, the point is, Creator Warehouse.
[1075.24 → 1077.62] Oh, shit.
[1078.84 → 1079.24] Sorry.
[1079.76 → 1082.34] That was quite the thing to witness.
[1083.74 → 1086.12] Does any other company need a Sancho producer?
[1086.30 → 1086.98] I mean, producer.
[1090.84 → 1093.36] Dan, how dare you apply for another job?
[1094.08 → 1095.50] Live on this show.
[1095.50 → 1098.96] He's not very professional.
[1099.20 → 1100.58] I'm not giving him a good reference.
[1101.50 → 1104.32] Yeah, just make sure you send me the link to your job postings.
[1104.44 → 1105.66] Then I can find out how to apply.
[1106.96 → 1108.02] Holy shit.
[1108.66 → 1110.00] That's a good reference, by the way.
[1111.74 → 1114.26] Anywho.
[1115.12 → 1116.82] Yeah, we would be okay.
[1116.82 → 1119.82] Because we have money coming in regularly.
[1120.56 → 1125.14] Yeah, not in large chunks.
[1125.14 → 1127.28] From corporate partners.
[1127.80 → 1130.84] But piecemeal from individual customers.
[1131.24 → 1134.50] That would mean that Creator Warehouse could lend us money to operate.
[1134.76 → 1138.32] And we would probably be fine.
[1138.64 → 1139.92] So that was my point.
[1140.02 → 1145.84] Was that if you have regular income, probably you can ride this out a lot more easily.
[1146.28 → 1150.28] But if, like this NAS software that we...
[1150.28 → 1153.18] I mean, I have no idea if I'm going to get anything back from this.
[1153.18 → 1155.76] They're creating a product that I really want to exist.
[1155.88 → 1163.12] It's like a simpler, user-friendly, and yet still powerful NAS solution for DIY and enthusiasts.
[1163.76 → 1171.50] And they are completely in, like, noses pressed against the screens, getting it going mode.
[1171.50 → 1171.92] Clearly.
[1172.14 → 1172.86] Yeah, clearly.
[1172.96 → 1173.24] Yeah.
[1173.50 → 1178.26] Because it's like, I don't know, 7 o'clock where he is right now.
[1178.92 → 1183.02] And he hasn't received, like, the biggest tech news and startups in a long time.
[1183.14 → 1183.36] Yeah.
[1183.36 → 1184.50] So he's clearly focused.
[1184.96 → 1185.46] I have a question for you.
[1185.46 → 1185.76] That's good.
[1185.82 → 1186.18] That's good.
[1186.36 → 1186.94] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1187.02 → 1188.02] I have a question for you.
[1188.02 → 1188.34] Oh!
[1188.34 → 1191.56] As the amount of pain.
[1193.74 → 1195.04] If you are...
[1195.04 → 1197.82] So you've invested in that company, you've invested in Framework.
[1197.88 → 1198.06] Yes.
[1198.06 → 1202.82] I wouldn't really call you an investor because you invest right now in things that you just, like, want to exist.
[1202.92 → 1205.36] I would describe myself as, like, an activist investor.
[1205.48 → 1206.28] Yeah, yeah.
[1206.28 → 1209.50] I went in both cases.
[1210.88 → 1213.74] Oh, how do I say this without it coming across the wrong way?
[1213.86 → 1215.20] Not expecting a return.
[1215.46 → 1215.88] Yeah.
[1216.78 → 1218.04] I went in both.
[1218.12 → 1222.16] If there's a return, I'm going to be like, cool.
[1222.54 → 1230.80] But like we talked about last week, the reality of it is, if I really wanted more money, my biggest investment is Linus Media Group Inc.,
[1230.80 → 1233.04] Creator Warehouse Inc., and Float plane Inc.
[1233.04 → 1240.08] If I wanted to have, like, truly f*** you money, that would be the way to do it.
[1240.18 → 1240.26] Yeah.
[1240.66 → 1246.16] I kind of danced around it last week, but it was a nine-figure offer, okay, for the whole shebang.
[1246.40 → 1247.64] I guess you technically danced around it.
[1247.64 → 1250.00] Some people misunderstood, which is remarkable.
[1250.14 → 1250.52] All right.
[1250.64 → 1253.14] Anyway, the point is, it was a nine-figure offer.
[1253.28 → 1255.12] If I wanted money, I could get money.
[1255.12 → 1265.56] The reason, the biggest reason I didn't take the money is that at the end of the day, I don't have, I don't aspire to a yacht lifestyle.
[1265.86 → 1267.18] You'd be so bored.
[1268.88 → 1272.24] You would actually hate that trip.
[1272.48 → 1282.04] I think, I guarantee, I've received photos from him when he's on vacation, like, standing on the beach with, like, the am so bored here face.
[1282.04 → 1285.84] He's not going to be entertained by a yacht.
[1286.60 → 1288.86] I wouldn't even bother renting a yacht.
[1289.04 → 1290.14] I don't even need to know.
[1290.26 → 1292.72] Even if it was free, he'd probably be like, I'd rather not.
[1292.78 → 1294.56] I already know I don't need it.
[1295.52 → 1295.96] Yeah.
[1295.96 → 1310.84] So, anyway, the point is that a big part of the reason that I didn't take it is that my life would not be materially changed by having a giant dragon horde, which is obviously a super privileged position.
[1311.12 → 1316.04] But it also means that I get to just do stuff like this.
[1316.04 → 1319.80] So, I get to just say, hey, that's something I really want to exist.
[1319.92 → 1321.30] I know you guys are super cool.
[1321.46 → 1325.34] And even if I never get anything out of it, this is great.
[1325.48 → 1330.32] I will be the most hands-off investor that you have ever had.
[1331.40 → 1339.70] Like, it's hilarious because even internally, people will want to know, like, what's going on with framework and stuff because it's, like, interesting technology.
[1339.70 → 1343.14] And I'm like, stuff.
[1343.84 → 1344.50] I don't know.
[1345.34 → 1347.70] I read about it in the tech news, same as you.
[1347.90 → 1349.02] Here's the actual question, though.
[1349.14 → 1349.48] Yes.
[1349.70 → 1351.56] If that wasn't your method of investing.
[1352.26 → 1352.54] Yeah.
[1352.82 → 1354.40] If you were investing for profit.
[1354.74 → 1355.06] Yeah.
[1355.92 → 1357.44] I mean, to be clear, I don't mind profit.
[1357.62 → 1357.94] Yeah, yeah.
[1358.20 → 1360.84] But if this was what you did, if you were a VC.
[1360.84 → 1361.88] Oh, like, I'm an investor.
[1361.96 → 1362.18] Yes.
[1362.18 → 1363.06] Like, that's what I do.
[1363.10 → 1363.28] Yeah.
[1363.42 → 1363.74] Sure.
[1363.98 → 1365.82] So, I'm putting you in this position.
[1365.82 → 1371.92] If this happened to one of the companies that you invested in, and they're screwed.
[1372.86 → 1373.96] Do you put in more?
[1374.16 → 1374.40] Yeah.
[1374.94 → 1376.82] I mean, it depends if I even have it.
[1376.88 → 1377.76] What if I bank at fucking...
[1377.76 → 1378.76] Let's assume...
[1378.76 → 1379.24] Oh, sorry.
[1379.34 → 1381.82] I missed the beep, but what if I bank there?
[1381.90 → 1383.80] Let's assume in this situation that you have the cash.
[1383.80 → 1384.06] Okay.
[1384.16 → 1387.10] I bank at Bank of America.
[1387.26 → 1389.06] That's the only bank in America I can think of.
[1389.06 → 1390.20] I bank at HSBC.
[1390.28 → 1390.82] I don't know.
[1390.98 → 1391.10] Sure.
[1391.32 → 1391.46] Yeah.
[1391.52 → 1391.62] Sure.
[1391.72 → 1392.04] Whatever.
[1392.44 → 1395.32] Because in this situation, like...
[1395.32 → 1395.66] Sorry.
[1395.66 → 1397.00] I'm a little flustered right now.
[1397.00 → 1397.50] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1398.06 → 1398.46] Reinvesting...
[1398.46 → 1399.72] Let's say you reinvest the same amount.
[1400.18 → 1402.46] Reinvesting means you just doubled the investment.
[1402.66 → 1403.06] Yeah.
[1403.70 → 1405.98] So, you're not getting your return, right?
[1405.98 → 1406.40] Yeah, you haven't...
[1406.40 → 1413.76] And, like, I would imagine the paperwork of putting that investment into it means you've
[1413.76 → 1416.50] probably increased their valuation or whatever.
[1416.80 → 1418.38] Like, I don't think you can just be...
[1418.38 → 1419.56] Say, oh, I will...
[1419.56 → 1422.40] I need to replace the like, money that disappeared.
[1423.72 → 1424.90] So, it gets weird.
[1424.90 → 1430.08] You already have the shares that presumably you were issued based on that initial investment.
[1430.08 → 1434.74] The fact that they, like, p***ed it away in a, you know, bank or...
[1434.74 → 1437.18] Whether they p***ed it away or lost it.
[1437.30 → 1437.48] Yeah.
[1437.76 → 1439.00] Or lost it or whatever.
[1439.30 → 1445.78] Like, the vehicle by which they lost the money because they bought, I don't know, 300 Herman
[1445.78 → 1446.88] Miller chairs or whatever.
[1447.00 → 1448.78] Like, it doesn't matter how they lost it.
[1448.86 → 1449.00] Yeah.
[1449.08 → 1449.66] It's gone.
[1449.66 → 1452.58] That doesn't mean you didn't get your shares.
[1452.62 → 1453.34] You've got your shares.
[1453.48 → 1457.50] So, if you give them more money, well, I think they would have to...
[1457.50 → 1459.50] They would have to dilute...
[1459.50 → 1460.76] They would have to issue more shares.
[1461.16 → 1465.42] Or you would have to find some justification for the valuation to be higher or something.
[1465.60 → 1467.14] Or some combination of the two, right?
[1467.38 → 1468.92] Like, you can't have something for nothing.
[1468.92 → 1473.88] So, it would be f***ed.
[1474.20 → 1474.40] Yeah.
[1475.34 → 1478.88] Because I'm wondering what's going to happen to certain companies right now.
[1480.38 → 1480.78] Yeah.
[1482.34 → 1482.78] Yeah.
[1483.00 → 1487.10] And, like, there's this brutal cycle that we just went through, right?
[1487.60 → 1488.00] All of...
[1488.00 → 1489.72] And there's been a bunch of news articles about this.
[1489.82 → 1492.30] Earlier this week, literally, I was reading one of them.
[1492.30 → 1499.38] There's been this cycle that has happened where a bunch of very good tech employees were laid off recently, right?
[1499.70 → 1499.96] Yeah.
[1500.02 → 1509.42] And a lot of these, like, hard-hitter, big-time tech employees spun up startups in the last, like...
[1509.42 → 1510.26] Like, month.
[1510.32 → 1511.06] Month or two.
[1513.40 → 1516.96] And a lot of these startups are, like, looking perfect, actually.
[1516.96 → 1523.22] But if they're banking here, they might have just lost all of their VC money that they just raised like that.
[1523.72 → 1526.68] So, people are talking low-interest loans is something you could do.
[1526.76 → 1532.80] I can tell you from researching it, you can't just issue, like, a 1% interest loan.
[1533.14 → 1536.98] Even if you're just super-droopy, definitely best friends.
[1537.74 → 1539.56] The government's going to be like, hold on a minute.
[1539.62 → 1539.84] Yeah.
[1540.06 → 1540.28] Yeah.
[1541.00 → 1542.26] This looks like a gift.
[1543.36 → 1543.98] Oh, man.
[1544.04 → 1545.42] There's people on Reddit, apparently.
[1545.52 → 1546.46] This is in Float plane Chat.
[1546.46 → 1550.84] People on Reddit posting about how their payroll companies went through SVB, so they weren't getting paychecks.
[1550.96 → 1551.20] Oh.
[1551.40 → 1558.68] Like, the fact that this is the bank of the cradle of, you know, modern internet technology,
[1559.30 → 1560.68] it means that there's...
[1562.50 → 1567.18] We can't even predict all the things that are going to go wrong because of this.
[1567.24 → 1571.88] Because one of the weird things is, like I said, I googled companies with cash stuck in SVB, right?
[1571.94 → 1573.46] And the main thing that shows up is ROK.
[1573.46 → 1583.32] I suspect over the next few days, week, month, we're going to hear about a lot more companies that had their stuff stuck, right?
[1585.38 → 1585.98] Wow.
[1588.38 → 1588.94] Okay.
[1588.94 → 1593.76] It sounds like the assets of SVB were specifically seized by the FDIC, by the way.
[1593.96 → 1594.40] Okay.
[1594.60 → 1595.66] So government's got it.
[1596.02 → 1596.46] Okay.
[1597.34 → 1599.84] Well, um, good luck, everybody.
[1601.46 → 1601.94] Oh.
[1602.84 → 1603.84] Do not like...
[1603.84 → 1605.00] Really, really, really brutal.
[1605.22 → 1605.50] Yeah.
[1605.50 → 1612.80] The ramifications of this, not only is, like, the main news cycle going to take quite a while to actually pick up the impact of this,
[1612.92 → 1617.86] but the ramifications of this are going to go on for an extremely long time.
[1618.50 → 1623.20] Silicon Valley Bank's been around for a while, and they've been a big deal in startups for a while.
[1623.50 → 1626.76] This is going to be a massive, massive change in how people do business.
[1626.86 → 1629.46] Because it's been, like, a default for a lot of people.
[1629.64 → 1629.92] Yeah.
[1629.92 → 1631.00] Oh, you got VC money?
[1631.16 → 1632.80] Time to go to Silicon Valley Bank.
[1633.40 → 1634.00] This is what you do.
[1634.00 → 1635.94] Got people saying the government is the reason for this.
[1635.98 → 1637.66] It is not that simple.
[1639.36 → 1642.92] Like, a bank run doesn't just happen because the government...
[1645.66 → 1646.42] I don't know.
[1646.48 → 1647.48] I don't know a lot of those types of things.
[1647.48 → 1648.60] Yeah, there's a lot of stuff.
[1648.70 → 1653.10] Like, I don't know how much of this is true, but Float plane Chat is just exploding right now
[1653.10 → 1658.70] with apparently insiders at SVB selling shares in the weeks leading up to this.
[1658.70 → 1663.66] I mean, obviously, they wouldn't figure this out at the last second
[1663.66 → 1666.72] that they didn't have cash reserves to cover their withdrawals, right?
[1666.96 → 1670.14] So, man, apparently Roblox has money in SVB.
[1670.22 → 1671.40] I don't even feel bad for them, though.
[1671.78 → 1672.10] No offence.
[1672.10 → 1673.56] They're rolling in it.
[1673.58 → 1674.20] I'm sure they'll be fine.
[1674.26 → 1675.32] Yeah, I think they'll figure it out.
[1676.22 → 1676.52] Wow.
[1676.84 → 1677.28] All right.
[1678.42 → 1678.82] Okay.
[1679.10 → 1680.78] Well, neat.
[1682.26 → 1683.32] Good luck, everybody.
[1683.86 → 1686.14] What do you want to talk about next, Mr. Luke?
[1686.14 → 1691.10] Um, um, um, should we talk about that?
[1691.36 → 1692.40] I think that's funny.
[1692.72 → 1693.20] The pouch?
[1693.88 → 1695.00] Oh, sure.
[1695.82 → 1698.38] Last week, we announced this.
[1698.80 → 1707.90] It's a pouch that holds technology, but we were informed that that name that we announced
[1707.90 → 1710.00] for it is, in fact, trademarked.
[1710.00 → 1717.56] How anyone managed to trademark a descriptive name is baffling to me, because when we went
[1717.56 → 1725.68] through the process of trademarking the name of our joystick covers, which will go on sale
[1725.68 → 1726.24] at some point.
[1726.94 → 1730.04] They're little silicone covers that go in your joysticks.
[1730.04 → 1730.78] It was in the bag last night?
[1730.78 → 1731.08] For travel.
[1731.56 → 1732.36] Uh, oh, were they?
[1732.56 → 1733.04] Uh, no.
[1733.12 → 1733.44] Different one.
[1733.52 → 1733.68] Okay.
[1733.80 → 1736.04] No, they're not for grip when you're gaming.
[1736.34 → 1737.28] They're for travel.
[1737.68 → 1740.62] Oh, so they're like protection so you don't get drift and stuff.
[1740.84 → 1741.48] We hope.
[1741.86 → 1742.06] Yeah.
[1742.24 → 1743.88] We don't guarantee anything.
[1744.00 → 1744.16] No.
[1744.26 → 1745.30] That would be a bad idea.
[1745.32 → 1750.28] We're not making any claims about anything, but they go over your joysticks, and they lock
[1750.28 → 1757.34] them in place when it's sitting in a bag or in storage or tight end when you're travelling
[1757.34 → 1758.16] or whatever else.
[1760.34 → 1765.04] So anyway, when we were going through the trademark process for that, we wanted to call them stick
[1765.04 → 1767.40] locks, and we wanted to trademark that.
[1767.40 → 1773.46] And we were basically told, yeah, you can't really trademark a name that is simply descriptive
[1773.46 → 1774.90] of the function of the product.
[1774.90 → 1780.98] So how anyone managed to trademark Tech Pouch is sort of baffling to me.
[1781.56 → 1787.54] It's cool to me that the owner of the Tech Pouch trademark apparently considers us an important
[1787.54 → 1790.90] enough rival to bother to send a cease and desist to.
[1791.28 → 1792.16] But anywho.
[1792.54 → 1793.26] We need a new name.
[1793.34 → 1795.44] The point is, we need a new name.
[1795.46 → 1797.78] And we need a new name so that we can relaunch the page.
[1797.94 → 1798.10] Yeah.
[1798.10 → 1799.74] Because if you noticed, it was taken off the site.
[1799.88 → 1800.04] Yeah.
[1800.14 → 1801.42] So it holds tech.
[1801.60 → 1802.80] I mean, it can hold anything.
[1803.20 → 1804.36] We have a couple of ideas.
[1804.36 → 1805.36] Do you want...
[1805.36 → 1806.16] Do you want to...
[1806.16 → 1808.98] I mean, I wouldn't recommend putting a sandwich in it.
[1808.98 → 1809.46] It could, though.
[1809.70 → 1811.38] Yeah, but these are fabric materials.
[1811.50 → 1812.36] They're fairly absorbent.
[1812.42 → 1815.72] If your sandwich gets a little leaky, get like some mayo in there.
[1815.78 → 1816.74] I don't know if it would be great.
[1816.76 → 1817.52] That'd be not great.
[1817.58 → 1819.80] Yeah, you don't need to like sandwich mayo and this thing.
[1820.00 → 1820.14] Yeah.
[1820.40 → 1823.72] Anyway, the point is that we've got a couple of names.
[1823.72 → 1823.82] Oh, you want a poll, right?
[1823.82 → 1824.78] Yeah, do you want to create a poll?
[1824.86 → 1825.30] Yeah, yeah.
[1826.22 → 1827.28] Idea number one.
[1828.68 → 1830.02] Where does this go?
[1830.72 → 1831.92] Yes, idea number one.
[1832.14 → 1832.90] Gamer Pouch.
[1832.90 → 1839.76] Which, once again, I think that would be pretty difficult to trademark, so it shouldn't be an issue.
[1840.22 → 1846.46] But my problem with that is it sounds an awful lot like, you know.
[1846.62 → 1847.28] Ah, yes.
[1847.68 → 1847.90] Yeah.
[1848.28 → 1848.68] Gamer Pouch.
[1848.68 → 1849.00] Okay.
[1849.30 → 1849.98] Other idea.
[1850.56 → 1851.44] Mini tech sack.
[1851.44 → 1857.08] That has its own innuendo problems.
[1859.80 → 1861.66] Tynan said tech bag of holding.
[1863.46 → 1865.22] We also call the...
[1865.22 → 1867.20] The big area in the backpack.
[1867.36 → 1870.32] Yeah, we call that like the compartment of holding, so I don't know.
[1872.40 → 1873.32] Bag of tech.
[1873.42 → 1874.48] Yeah, that's pretty funny.
[1874.48 → 1876.56] Linus's tech sack.
[1878.16 → 1878.56] Okay.
[1878.76 → 1881.24] I appreciate the suggestions, float plane chat.
[1881.74 → 1885.72] I don't know that we're going to go with any of those.
[1886.48 → 1887.40] Gadget bag.
[1887.66 → 1888.42] Nerd bag.
[1888.84 → 1889.60] The pouch.
[1890.66 → 1891.96] Tech tips pouch.
[1893.00 → 1894.00] Yeah, you also don't...
[1894.00 → 1895.98] Yeah, like you could take the mini off.
[1896.04 → 1897.08] It could just be tech sack.
[1897.30 → 1898.20] Yeah, it could be tech sack.
[1898.62 → 1899.78] You want to throw tech sack in there?
[1899.90 → 1901.10] I said tech sack in there.
[1901.12 → 1902.16] How about tech tips pouch?
[1903.18 → 1904.06] Tech tips pouch?
[1904.28 → 1904.50] Yeah.
[1905.38 → 1906.10] It's not tech pouch.
[1906.22 → 1907.14] It's tech tips pouch.
[1907.14 → 1907.88] Tech tips pouch.
[1908.00 → 1908.46] All right.
[1910.66 → 1912.66] LOM says tech sack is fine.
[1912.90 → 1913.98] I kind of like tech sack.
[1914.32 → 1915.38] Yeah, tech sack's not bad.
[1915.74 → 1916.32] Thanks, bro.
[1916.60 → 1916.92] Yeah.
[1917.16 → 1918.06] Yeah, it's pretty good.
[1918.72 → 1920.14] We could call it LTT pouch.
[1920.38 → 1920.58] Yeah.
[1920.70 → 1921.80] Yeah, that's actually not bad.
[1921.80 → 1923.80] Throw LTT pouch in there.
[1924.10 → 1924.58] LTT pouch?
[1924.66 → 1924.80] Got it.
[1924.80 → 1925.40] You should probably...
[1925.40 → 1927.06] I feel like we're going to have to do like a...
[1927.06 → 1930.42] like we pick the highest two and then re-vote.
[1930.68 → 1933.56] You should throw Pouch McPouchface in there just...
[1933.56 → 1933.94] Sure.
[1934.00 → 1935.20] ...to make sure that we're...
[1935.20 → 1937.46] We've got the internet culture represented.
[1937.46 → 1939.12] Would we actually launch that?
[1939.98 → 1944.92] I will commit to whatever the audience ultimately votes for.
[1949.56 → 1952.72] I can actually feel Nick's cringe from here.
[1954.44 → 1955.78] The energy is strong.
[1955.78 → 1956.72] At least temporarily.
[1957.06 → 1957.92] At least temporarily.
[1958.16 → 1958.58] We will...
[1958.58 → 1959.68] Jayden said NCI pouch.
[1959.78 → 1961.02] I think we actually couldn't do that.
[1961.06 → 1961.98] No, we couldn't do that.
[1962.06 → 1964.88] That would definitely be an actual trademark issue.
[1965.04 → 1965.26] Yeah.
[1968.40 → 1968.76] Okay.
[1968.94 → 1969.12] Yeah.
[1969.18 → 1970.72] Let's go with what we've got.
[1970.80 → 1971.36] Let's launch the poll.
[1971.36 → 1972.52] That is six options.
[1972.68 → 1972.96] Okay.
[1973.22 → 1973.62] Hit it.
[1973.62 → 1976.70] All right.
[1976.70 → 1976.72] All right.
[1976.72 → 1976.74] All right.
[1976.74 → 1976.76] All right.
[1976.76 → 1976.96] All right.
[1976.96 → 1977.26] Oh, man.
[1977.26 → 1977.96] I need to see...
[1977.96 → 1979.02] Who immediately takes off?
[1979.26 → 1982.30] Pouch McPouchface with almost 100% of the vote.
[1982.30 → 1989.82] Why did you agree to that?
[1989.82 → 1989.94] Okay.
[1989.94 → 1990.44] All right.
[1990.44 → 1991.04] Okay.
[1991.04 → 1993.22] More serious votes are starting to come in.
[1993.60 → 1997.16] Pouch McPouchface held 90% for like 30 seconds.
[1997.30 → 1997.52] Yeah.
[1997.52 → 1999.30] And has now fallen.
[1999.30 → 2000.90] Tech Sack looks like it's going to come away with it.
[2000.98 → 2001.42] We'll do...
[2001.42 → 2001.72] Yeah.
[2001.72 → 2005.50] We will do a playoff between the top two, and we'll see how it comes out.
[2005.52 → 2006.88] Tech Sack is cruising.
[2007.14 → 2007.38] Yeah.
[2007.58 → 2009.60] Tech Sack is making up a lot of ground here.
[2010.00 → 2013.30] Why don't we change gears a little bit here?
[2014.30 → 2014.36] Yeah.
[2014.36 → 2014.76] And...
[2014.76 → 2015.30] Oh, man.
[2015.54 → 2016.26] Paul...
[2016.26 → 2018.68] Luke, we've got so much stuff to talk about this week.
[2019.04 → 2020.84] We've got a secret shopper update.
[2021.34 → 2021.40] Dell...
[2021.40 → 2025.08] Yeah, but we don't normally do our own stuff in the first four announcements.
[2025.10 → 2025.80] No, this is Dell.
[2026.46 → 2028.82] Dell reached out to me out of nowhere being like,
[2029.50 → 2033.10] Hey, we have no idea if you have a secret shopper planned or anything like that,
[2033.18 → 2034.20] but we're ready.
[2035.14 → 2036.58] So I figured we'd talk about that.
[2036.64 → 2039.38] But first, why don't we do an update on the whole Markov situation?
[2039.70 → 2039.98] Okay.
[2040.12 → 2040.32] Yeah.
[2040.32 → 2040.34] Yeah.
[2040.44 → 2041.96] Chat's asking about like a parent...
[2041.96 → 2042.10] I'm sorry.
[2042.22 → 2043.12] What happened to Goat?
[2043.22 → 2043.50] Like...
[2043.50 → 2043.72] Okay.
[2043.72 → 2044.88] Got root kitted or something...
[2044.88 → 2045.08] What?
[2045.20 → 2046.10] Like his system's down?
[2046.30 → 2047.74] People have been arrested in China?
[2048.02 → 2048.54] Not...
[2048.54 → 2049.34] What is happening?
[2049.48 → 2051.38] Literally not one time that we've been...
[2051.40 → 2054.64] We've talked about Goat or his videos on Sancho.
[2054.78 → 2058.34] Have I expected we were going to talk about Goat or his videos on Sancho?
[2058.52 → 2063.62] So I am yet again apologizing to Goat because I wasn't prepared for this.
[2063.72 → 2066.68] But he has released his third video on the topic now.
[2066.80 → 2068.58] It started with The Wiggle That Killed Markov,
[2068.64 → 2070.78] which is currently sitting at 2.2 million views.
[2071.00 → 2071.32] Wow.
[2072.32 → 2075.20] But his most recent video is I Was Attacked.
[2075.78 → 2078.54] And he talks about some of what happened in the aftermath.
[2079.00 → 2084.68] One of the things that he points out is that he was told by a number of people, including me,
[2085.26 → 2087.56] that he should have wiped his drive after all that happened.
[2087.98 → 2088.70] And he did not.
[2091.28 → 2092.58] And one of the things that he tried to do...
[2092.58 → 2093.62] Why don't you explain why?
[2094.32 → 2098.08] Well, he installed their software on his local system.
[2098.24 → 2099.90] We got to get people up to speed.
[2099.90 → 2101.04] Okay, okay, okay.
[2101.24 → 2105.00] So what happened was Goat, or also known as Goat Moth,
[2105.12 → 2108.08] a creator in the Markov space, Escape from Markov,
[2108.16 → 2111.24] a video game that I and a number of other people play.
[2114.08 → 2115.18] Oh, are we good?
[2115.30 → 2115.56] Okay.
[2116.18 → 2118.72] He made a video called The Wiggle That Killed Markov,
[2118.86 → 2121.62] which was an investigative journalism piece on...
[2121.62 → 2122.08] Perfect.
[2122.10 → 2123.16] It was fantastic.
[2123.52 → 2125.90] On cheating in Markov and how it's...
[2125.90 → 2126.38] The pervasiveness.
[2126.38 → 2129.24] And how much worse it is than most people realize
[2129.24 → 2131.60] because of the type of cheats that people use.
[2131.72 → 2134.52] A lot of people, when they're thinking about cheating in first-person shooter games,
[2134.62 → 2136.84] the main thing they think about is aim.
[2137.34 → 2137.48] Yeah.
[2137.68 → 2140.40] Another thing that people think about is wall hacks, stuff like that.
[2140.48 → 2143.26] But usually you think about the obvious forms of cheating.
[2143.42 → 2143.70] Yes.
[2143.92 → 2149.44] And in Markov, it's not necessarily the obvious forms that are the most pervasive.
[2149.44 → 2153.02] It's the things that aren't very obvious unless you are also cheating.
[2153.02 → 2156.82] So he had to cheat in order to reveal this issue.
[2157.76 → 2162.74] He then followed up talking about how his account that he cheated on did get banned,
[2162.88 → 2163.92] but he knew that was coming.
[2164.24 → 2167.68] He didn't hide his raid IDs or anything, so it was very easy for them to detect.
[2168.14 → 2170.28] And lots of things have happened in the aftermath.
[2170.50 → 2172.74] We covered some of this, I believe, in last show.
[2172.90 → 2173.00] Yeah.
[2173.00 → 2179.82] But anyway, after the video, you advised him to completely wipe his drive, fresh installation.
[2179.94 → 2183.34] And the reason for that was because in order to expose the cheaters,
[2183.92 → 2187.58] Goat installed the same cheat software that they were using,
[2188.00 → 2192.08] which, I mean, I don't want to generalize.
[2192.08 → 2200.58] But if I was going to generalize, I would say that if you're a developer of cheating software for video games,
[2200.80 → 2206.00] you're probably not the most savoury character.
[2206.00 → 2212.32] It's very likely if you download cheats for a game that you are also downloading things that you probably don't want on your system.
[2212.66 → 2213.82] Whether that is...
[2213.82 → 2214.58] And it's probably...
[2214.58 → 2217.90] Well, I'm saying if you develop cheats for games, you are probably...
[2217.90 → 2218.40] Oh, yeah.
[2218.78 → 2221.00] You are probably selling software...
[2221.00 → 2222.42] Your morals might be a little questionable.
[2222.44 → 2224.46] ...that people shouldn't have on their system.
[2224.64 → 2224.86] Yeah.
[2225.20 → 2231.20] So it's quite common to have, like, Bitcoin miners...
[2231.20 → 2235.92] Or not necessarily Bitcoin, but coin miners installed on your system that are going to run in the background that you don't know about.
[2236.26 → 2236.92] Stuff like that.
[2236.92 → 2240.22] It's also very possible that, like in this particular situation,
[2240.22 → 2244.92] they install a rootkit on your system that they can, like, do basically whatever they want with.
[2245.64 → 2249.42] And he went to try to get some...
[2249.42 → 2256.52] In his original video, he talked about how he didn't want to interview the cheat developers.
[2256.84 → 2260.68] For this video, he has interviews with some anti-cheat developers,
[2260.90 → 2263.12] and he wanted some voice clips from cheat developers.
[2263.58 → 2264.02] And he thought...
[2264.02 → 2264.86] You should watch the video.
[2264.94 → 2265.96] Don't get everything from the WAN show.
[2266.98 → 2267.66] For real.
[2267.84 → 2268.02] Yeah.
[2268.02 → 2269.72] It's actually, like, I'm not going to...
[2269.72 → 2270.86] It's a 16-minute video, and it's packed.
[2270.86 → 2271.80] No, I just mean in general.
[2271.92 → 2272.08] Yeah.
[2272.42 → 2273.18] Also that.
[2275.22 → 2280.42] But he wanted, like, a voice clip from the people that developed the cheat that he used in particular,
[2280.96 → 2282.26] because he brought up...
[2282.26 → 2284.00] It had gone undetected for three years.
[2284.42 → 2287.58] So he wants to hear them, like, being really cocky about it, basically.
[2287.98 → 2288.32] Sure.
[2288.46 → 2289.72] He reconnected to their Discord.
[2290.06 → 2291.58] They now have some form of verification,
[2291.58 → 2297.24] and they figured out that it was a new user from the same...
[2297.24 → 2298.16] I don't know if...
[2298.16 → 2299.18] I don't remember all the details.
[2299.26 → 2299.88] You should watch the video.
[2300.08 → 2300.26] Yeah.
[2300.26 → 2301.76] But they figured out that it was him, essentially.
[2302.02 → 2302.24] Yeah.
[2302.34 → 2304.56] And then just, like, nuked his drives.
[2305.54 → 2305.94] Wow.
[2306.18 → 2306.90] Couldn't boot anymore.
[2307.02 → 2310.20] Couldn't even find the drives when, like, looking through BIOS or anything.
[2310.44 → 2313.32] He thinks they killed, like, the drivers on his NVMe drives.
[2314.08 → 2315.14] Killed the drivers?
[2315.26 → 2315.58] What does that even mean?
[2315.58 → 2316.66] I don't know necessarily, yeah.
[2316.66 → 2318.60] I haven't looked into it enough.
[2319.10 → 2319.66] I...
[2319.66 → 2321.66] I...
[2322.30 → 2324.32] There are a few ways that that could happen.
[2324.60 → 2325.04] Sure.
[2325.24 → 2327.48] Without having access to stuff, I have no idea.
[2327.52 → 2330.34] I'm not good enough to make enough assumptions to know.
[2330.84 → 2331.24] Wild.
[2331.36 → 2331.66] The controller...
[2332.26 → 2332.64] Yeah.
[2335.22 → 2337.66] If they're NVMe drives, they're, like...
[2338.18 → 2339.96] It's not a hard drive.
[2340.72 → 2343.20] So you can fry those in a variety of ways.
[2343.32 → 2343.60] Right.
[2343.72 → 2344.20] To be honest.
[2344.20 → 2346.80] In hard drives, there are other bad ways you can do it.
[2346.94 → 2352.56] And I have since told him, like, yeah, it could also be in your BIOS at this point.
[2352.78 → 2353.02] Yeah.
[2353.14 → 2355.44] So that's a whole thing that also came out this week.
[2355.54 → 2356.58] That there's...
[2356.58 → 2357.98] Oh, crap.
[2358.02 → 2358.92] I forget the details.
[2358.92 → 2362.92] But basically, there's the first instance of...
[2364.34 → 2366.12] It's been theorized for a while.
[2366.12 → 2366.46] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2366.46 → 2378.50] But there's the first instance of, like, a firmware-based malware that can survive a complete system reformat because it can fool the...
[2378.50 → 2379.92] All the like, trusted...
[2379.92 → 2382.30] Trusted boot job...
[2382.30 → 2382.82] Oh, man.
[2382.96 → 2383.10] Yeah.
[2383.14 → 2383.62] Secure boot.
[2383.76 → 2392.30] It can fool Secure boot and, like, all the trust elements in that chain that protect the pre-operating system loading.
[2392.30 → 2394.96] Actually, even pre-UEFI loading environments.
[2394.96 → 2396.12] So that's a whole...
[2396.12 → 2397.84] That's a whole thing.
[2398.38 → 2398.76] Man.
[2399.30 → 2400.46] Like, seriously?
[2400.66 → 2405.34] Malware that can survive a complete system format and then just go and reinstall itself?
[2405.58 → 2408.28] I mean, we've had stuff that can hide in BIOS for a while.
[2408.62 → 2410.98] That thing that you're talking about is different.
[2411.08 → 2412.24] This is pre-BIOS, though.
[2412.30 → 2412.50] Yeah.
[2412.78 → 2413.04] Yeah.
[2413.04 → 2414.20] Which is, like, bad.
[2414.28 → 2414.64] Oh, yeah.
[2414.70 → 2415.20] That's terrible.
[2415.24 → 2416.00] That's even worse.
[2416.10 → 2416.26] Yeah.
[2416.26 → 2422.96] Anywho, in order to install something like that, they would need admin authorization on your computer.
[2423.14 → 2426.58] But the thing is, when you run an executable...
[2426.58 → 2426.80] Yeah.
[2426.98 → 2427.90] Guess what that is?
[2428.08 → 2428.28] Yeah.
[2429.02 → 2431.36] So that was kind of rough.
[2431.48 → 2432.82] But, I mean, Go's doing okay.
[2433.00 → 2435.04] He got a 2.2 million view video.
[2435.18 → 2436.78] He's probably doing all right, right now.
[2436.88 → 2437.04] Yeah.
[2437.12 → 2438.04] And he can probably replace some drives.
[2438.04 → 2438.82] Buy a new NVMe drive.
[2438.82 → 2439.26] Yeah.
[2439.26 → 2440.74] So he pitched those drives.
[2440.82 → 2443.60] Hopefully, that's the extent of what needs to happen there.
[2443.60 → 2447.32] But there's also some other crazy news that happened that he reported on in that video.
[2447.42 → 2452.94] And you should watch it because he has some interviews with the devs of a game that I don't remember off the top of my head right now.
[2453.00 → 2455.12] We don't have notes for this because I didn't know we were going to talk about it today.
[2455.28 → 2456.92] And the interviews are very interesting.
[2457.02 → 2459.26] And they talk about how they have totally...
[2459.26 → 2460.94] Their game was, like, overrun with cheaters.
[2461.52 → 2463.94] And they talked about what they did in order to fix it.
[2463.94 → 2470.24] And now there's, like, public community posts by users, like, players of the game, talking about, like,
[2470.38 → 2471.38] Yeah, it's a completely different world.
[2471.46 → 2472.42] I don't run into any anymore.
[2472.70 → 2472.88] Wow.
[2472.96 → 2473.22] That's cool.
[2473.22 → 2475.56] And their whole approach makes a ton of sense.
[2475.60 → 2479.76] And we've talked about it on WAN Show, where they just have a bunch of systems in place.
[2480.26 → 2484.32] And he talks about it, but they call it, like, the Swiss cheese approach or something.
[2484.60 → 2486.30] Because, like, each system is going to have some holes.
[2486.74 → 2491.66] But you just have enough of them that eventually you're not going to be able to make it all the way through.
[2491.66 → 2492.30] Nothing can pass all the way through.
[2492.42 → 2492.60] Yeah.
[2492.60 → 2493.92] And maybe some can.
[2494.06 → 2496.80] But, like, they've gotten it to a point where it's so low.
[2497.22 → 2502.36] I mean, we've talked before about how there are cheats that are literally a robot arm
[2502.36 → 2502.82] Yes.
[2502.82 → 2503.50] Playing the game.
[2503.70 → 2504.70] That no anti-cheat can detect.
[2504.70 → 2505.30] You're not going to fully stop it.
[2505.32 → 2506.52] But that's not fun.
[2506.64 → 2506.98] Yes.
[2507.54 → 2507.76] Yeah.
[2507.76 → 2514.36] Very few people are going to set up a 3D printer to move the mouse around for them to play the game.
[2514.48 → 2515.56] Like, that's not...
[2515.56 → 2516.50] You just get to observe.
[2516.60 → 2518.12] Maybe some Raters will and stuff.
[2518.18 → 2520.94] But, like, you're really massively reducing the impact.
[2521.10 → 2521.36] Yes.
[2521.36 → 2523.98] But, like...
[2523.98 → 2524.22] Yeah.
[2524.32 → 2525.52] So, you should watch it.
[2525.58 → 2526.28] Those interviews are really cool.
[2526.28 → 2530.68] Most cheaters want to press the button and feel like a Chad because they, you know...
[2530.68 → 2531.68] I'm sick of this game.
[2531.80 → 2532.44] Or whatever.
[2532.58 → 2532.76] Right?
[2532.76 → 2532.82] Yeah.
[2533.04 → 2538.34] So, I feel like for most cheaters, that's not going to be that appealing.
[2538.60 → 2538.76] Yeah.
[2539.04 → 2539.22] Yeah.
[2539.58 → 2540.98] So, and that's all fascinating.
[2541.16 → 2543.06] But one of the things that he talks about in the video...
[2543.06 → 2543.80] And, again, I don't have notes.
[2543.90 → 2545.28] So, I'm hoping I'm going to remember this well.
[2545.28 → 2550.28] But, that cheat that he used...
[2550.28 → 2552.52] There's stuff on their Discord.
[2552.80 → 2553.16] Oh, man.
[2553.18 → 2554.16] I wish I could bring this up right now.
[2554.36 → 2557.78] There's stuff on their Discord talking about how the service is offline.
[2558.04 → 2562.26] And no one can use it right now because it has to call to a service all the time.
[2562.34 → 2563.62] And their servers are, like, gone.
[2564.00 → 2565.28] And there's people reporting that...
[2566.10 → 2571.60] We don't know who necessarily, but some amount of arrests was made.
[2572.58 → 2573.02] Arrests?
[2573.18 → 2573.66] Arrests.
[2573.66 → 2575.16] Like, people were put in jail.
[2576.08 → 2577.74] And their servers were seized.
[2578.18 → 2580.26] This is a cheat developer based in China.
[2580.66 → 2580.78] Now, hold on a second.
[2580.78 → 2582.90] We have no idea who did this.
[2582.96 → 2583.94] We don't know if it was BSG.
[2584.10 → 2586.66] We don't know if the investigation was already running from someone else.
[2586.74 → 2587.44] I know that...
[2587.44 → 2587.82] No idea.
[2588.06 → 2592.10] I know that developing game cheats is illegal in, I think, South Korea.
[2592.28 → 2594.44] I think also using them is illegal in South Korea.
[2595.10 → 2599.70] But I wasn't aware of any legislation like that in China.
[2599.98 → 2600.52] Me neither.
[2600.52 → 2607.24] I do know that there is a culture of Chinese players cheating outside of China.
[2607.24 → 2610.34] So I do wonder if maybe there is something.
[2610.62 → 2617.96] And that's why they go to, like, North American or European servers is because they might get caught if they go on local servers.
[2617.96 → 2619.94] I have no idea.
[2620.14 → 2620.94] I have no clue.
[2621.24 → 2622.32] Just a random theory.
[2624.58 → 2625.18] Wow.
[2625.58 → 2626.74] Very interesting.
[2626.90 → 2633.40] Like the last story we were talking about, this is very much a developing story right now.
[2633.40 → 2635.40] And I cannot believe...
[2636.18 → 2636.74] I mean...
[2636.74 → 2637.62] The level of impact?
[2637.80 → 2642.02] When we first talked about this, I went, wow, that's really cool.
[2642.14 → 2642.76] F*** that game.
[2643.26 → 2643.50] Right?
[2644.02 → 2648.40] Like, I love this kind of expose, investigative journalism type of content.
[2648.40 → 2649.42] Yeah, and he's done a great job.
[2649.56 → 2649.64] Yeah.
[2649.70 → 2649.88] Yeah.
[2650.10 → 2652.62] Like, you know, good job, kudos, and all of that.
[2652.66 → 2652.86] Right?
[2654.54 → 2658.84] I didn't expect the explosion on their community last week.
[2658.84 → 2666.84] I didn't expect that we're going to be looking at people getting literally arrested over the development of this cheating software.
[2666.96 → 2670.76] Dude, when I was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to, like, quit for a while because this situation is so bad.
[2670.96 → 2673.24] I didn't expect things would happen.
[2673.38 → 2674.34] I still haven't played yet.
[2674.46 → 2682.42] But, like, I didn't expect things would happen this fast that are like, oh, the like, main cheat in the whole game just got deleted from the internet.
[2682.72 → 2684.76] Like, that's a pretty big deal.
[2684.76 → 2686.48] Oh, BBC.com.
[2686.48 → 2690.86] Police bust world's biggest video game cheat operation.
[2691.62 → 2699.08] Several luxury sports cars were among assets seized in the raid.
[2699.96 → 2700.54] Nice cars.
[2701.84 → 2704.78] Ah, Chinese police and gaming giant Tencent.
[2704.92 → 2709.70] They probably go faster than, like, all the other cars on the track because they're, like, cheating.
[2710.14 → 2711.16] Because they what?
[2711.24 → 2711.58] They cheated?
[2711.72 → 2712.18] Oh, my God.
[2712.18 → 2716.76] 76 million dollars in revenue.
[2716.96 → 2718.90] They stole, they seized assets for 46 million.
[2718.90 → 2720.30] 76 million in rev.
[2720.98 → 2723.14] How many people are buying this stuff?
[2724.08 → 2727.88] Subscription prices for users began at about a $10 a day?
[2727.88 → 2731.06] I don't know.
[2731.06 → 2732.48] 100% know if this is the same.
[2732.48 → 2732.52] Hold on.
[2732.62 → 2733.38] Is this the same one?
[2733.44 → 2734.02] When is this from?
[2734.02 → 2734.18] I don't know.
[2734.46 → 2734.84] I don't know.
[2734.86 → 2736.80] This is from March 30th.
[2736.94 → 2738.38] Oh, two years ago.
[2738.50 → 2738.72] Never mind.
[2738.80 → 2739.02] This is old.
[2739.18 → 2739.68] This is, yeah.
[2739.86 → 2740.12] Okay.
[2740.40 → 2741.44] Yeah, because it's said, like.
[2741.44 → 2745.66] Oh, I think they posted this to show that, yes, it is very much a thing.
[2745.72 → 2746.20] It is a thing.
[2746.32 → 2746.78] Okay, yeah.
[2746.86 → 2747.32] Fair enough.
[2747.48 → 2747.64] Yeah.
[2748.06 → 2748.66] All right.
[2749.50 → 2749.90] All right.
[2749.90 → 2750.88] Well, thank you for that.
[2752.18 → 2752.52] Wow.
[2753.50 → 2757.24] There's a bunch of people posting in Flow plane chat, Wanna Pack.
[2757.62 → 2759.86] Andrew Tate was running a cheating operation?
[2760.18 → 2760.80] Got him.
[2761.80 → 2763.12] It's not a fanny pack, though.
[2763.40 → 2764.90] Yeah, it's not a fanny pack.
[2764.98 → 2770.14] If we were to ever do a fanny pack, I give you my personal Linus Tech Tips guarantee.
[2770.42 → 2771.68] We will call it the Wanna Pack.
[2771.74 → 2772.24] I promise.
[2773.14 → 2775.32] As long as it has, like, a WAN sort of theme.
[2775.32 → 2776.12] It would have to be WAN.
[2776.24 → 2776.88] Yeah, colour scheme.
[2776.96 → 2777.98] But yes, yes, yes.
[2778.04 → 2778.58] We will do it.
[2778.64 → 2779.00] We'll do it.
[2779.38 → 2779.66] Okay.
[2779.74 → 2780.84] We should remake the poll.
[2780.84 → 2783.52] It's Tech Sack versus Pouch McPouchface.
[2783.84 → 2784.14] Okay.
[2784.40 → 2786.08] Guys, come on.
[2787.68 → 2791.66] Oh, actually, Linus Tech Tote had a lot of people asking for it as well.
[2792.30 → 2796.14] Should we just do another round and then do one more after?
[2796.54 → 2798.14] I think it's got to come down to two.
[2798.20 → 2800.00] Yeah, we'll put these two more options in.
[2800.12 → 2801.96] So let's put in the two new options.
[2801.96 → 2805.46] So Linus Tech Tote and, or no, that's the only one.
[2805.86 → 2807.56] And then Tech Sack and Pouch McPouchface.
[2810.84 → 2811.28] Okay.
[2812.80 → 2813.20] Okay.
[2813.46 → 2813.70] Yeah.
[2814.10 → 2815.38] Tote is just T-O-T-E, right?
[2815.48 → 2815.64] Yeah.
[2817.12 → 2817.86] Oh, man.
[2818.04 → 2819.50] Oh, the LTT bag.
[2820.60 → 2822.14] That's pretty funny, actually.
[2822.90 → 2824.30] Throw in the LTT bag.
[2824.38 → 2824.50] Okay.
[2824.62 → 2826.02] So just LTT bag.
[2826.22 → 2829.92] But it's funny if you say it out loud because testicles.
[2829.92 → 2834.66] I didn't get it, actually, until you said it's funny if you say it out loud.
[2834.72 → 2835.44] And then I got it.
[2835.52 → 2836.10] I don't know why.
[2838.32 → 2839.48] Because testicles.
[2839.48 → 2840.18] Jeez.
[2843.16 → 2844.10] Oh, no.
[2845.36 → 2846.04] All right.
[2846.26 → 2848.64] Why don't we change gears?
[2849.32 → 2850.00] And, oh, my.
[2850.18 → 2851.66] Is there any good news this week?
[2853.30 → 2857.30] Ring is giving police invasive user footage.
[2857.30 → 2862.80] I mean, we're not just talking, like, you know, porch pirates need a reckoning and you
[2862.80 → 2864.28] got to, like, catch these guys.
[2864.38 → 2866.90] We're talking last year.
[2868.16 → 2872.90] Ring announced that at the end of this month it will require new and existing users to buy
[2872.90 → 2876.20] a subscription for basic security features that used to be included with the purchase
[2876.20 → 2881.94] of the camera, including using the Ring app to arm and disarm security, receiving notifications
[2881.94 → 2885.72] when an alarm triggers, or customizing the camera to record during an alarm.
[2885.72 → 2892.14] It was allowing police access to users' cameras without a warrant or the owner's consent because
[2892.14 → 2893.74] the police claimed it was an emergency.
[2894.60 → 2899.22] Ring has also been repeatedly criticized for providing users' footage to police, even when
[2899.22 → 2902.20] it has no legal obligation to do so.
[2903.52 → 2908.80] Ring claims that they carefully review all requests from law enforcement and ask for revising
[2908.80 → 2912.00] warrants when the demands are inappropriate or overly broad.
[2912.00 → 2917.42] But last year, Michael Larkin, a Ring user in Ohio with 21 cameras around his home and
[2917.42 → 2922.24] business, was asked by police to provide footage from his outside-facing cameras to aid in an
[2922.24 → 2924.10] ongoing investigation into a neighbour.
[2924.64 → 2928.10] He voluntarily gave them the footage from the time period they requested.
[2928.62 → 2932.80] The police then asked for all the footage from the day in question, which he declined.
[2933.38 → 2936.64] The cameras record in short bursts whenever there's movement, and it would have taken a long
[2936.64 → 2938.10] time to download and send each file.
[2938.10 → 2943.44] The police then sent a warrant to Ring requesting all the footage from all of his cameras,
[2943.82 → 2948.62] which Ring gave them, including footage from the three cameras inside his house and the
[2948.62 → 2952.30] 13 cameras at his business, which is at a completely separate location.
[2952.88 → 2957.24] One of the cameras inside the home is located in his bedroom.
[2957.74 → 2958.12] Okay.
[2958.12 → 2961.90] What the f***?
[2964.42 → 2966.26] Am I the crazy person here?
[2966.72 → 2970.34] There's a discussion question that said, should consumers ever trust a large company have access
[2970.34 → 2971.28] to their footage at this point?
[2971.42 → 2971.76] No.
[2973.40 → 2974.30] Close circuit, man.
[2974.72 → 2980.26] Larkin only found out about this when Ring sent him a notification that police had been
[2980.26 → 2981.00] given his footage.
[2981.34 → 2987.22] They didn't request or otherwise push back on the warrant or anything like that.
[2987.22 → 2990.70] They're just like, yep, here's footage from this guy's bedroom.
[2991.90 → 2994.86] Hopefully you like watching videos of him banging.
[2997.38 → 2997.82] Yeah.
[2998.08 → 2999.04] Unbelievable, right?
[2999.44 → 2999.74] Yeah.
[2999.96 → 3001.02] No, it absolutely is.
[3001.16 → 3001.40] I don't know.
[3001.46 → 3003.58] We've talked about this concept for a long time.
[3003.90 → 3009.24] We've warned people about like doorbell stuff, like Ring doorbells for a long time.
[3009.32 → 3009.78] This is why.
[3010.14 → 3010.40] Yeah.
[3010.50 → 3014.02] We did a couple sponsor spots with Ring way back in the day.
[3014.02 → 3015.84] I think that was like pre-Amazon acquisition.
[3016.68 → 3023.52] And I forget when it happened, but there was like a fairly early incident where they
[3023.52 → 3024.68] were just handing over footage.
[3024.68 → 3028.46] And we basically said, look, you guys need to change this policy, or we're not going to
[3028.46 → 3029.16] work with you anymore.
[3031.64 → 3034.50] Well, we don't work with Ring anymore.
[3034.76 → 3034.98] Yeah.
[3035.08 → 3037.10] There are solutions for this.
[3037.44 → 3040.22] They're not quite as easy, and they're not quite as cheap.
[3040.22 → 3040.66] Yeah.
[3040.84 → 3043.52] But there are solutions for this, for doing it yourself.
[3045.28 → 3048.60] And unfortunately, that's the way it's got to be, in my opinion.
[3049.70 → 3051.84] Especially if you have the cameras inside your house, man.
[3052.10 → 3052.28] Like.
[3052.70 → 3053.38] In the bedroom.
[3053.74 → 3054.00] Yeah.
[3054.62 → 3055.18] I do have.
[3056.20 → 3056.56] Okay.
[3056.70 → 3060.44] I was about to be all judgy and say, well, why would you have a camera in your bedroom in
[3060.44 → 3060.98] the first place?
[3061.00 → 3062.40] That's stupid or something like that.
[3062.40 → 3063.44] But I mean, okay.
[3063.46 → 3063.94] I don't know.
[3064.00 → 3068.32] Maybe they have pets and maybe their pets like to hang out in the bedroom and they, you
[3068.32 → 3070.12] know, like to keep an eye on them for whatever reason.
[3070.20 → 3073.24] Like they could have health problems, or you don't know, right?
[3073.26 → 3075.12] You never know what someone's situation is.
[3075.32 → 3075.46] Yeah.
[3075.60 → 3079.30] Maybe there's a very good reason that they have.
[3080.98 → 3081.38] Conrad.
[3083.30 → 3084.36] What the heck, man?
[3085.08 → 3087.70] I personally use Dufy cameras in my bathroom.
[3087.96 → 3089.28] This is one of our developers.
[3089.60 → 3091.00] Surely you must know better.
[3091.74 → 3092.04] He's.
[3092.14 → 3092.92] I mean, he's kidding.
[3093.78 → 3094.96] He's 100% kidding.
[3095.48 → 3095.88] Yeah.
[3096.06 → 3096.46] Okay.
[3096.46 → 3098.46] Okay.
[3100.38 → 3100.78] Okay.
[3100.86 → 3102.38] It's time for our last poll.
[3103.04 → 3104.42] We do need this name.
[3104.52 → 3106.28] We need to get this thing relaunched on the store.
[3106.88 → 3107.30] The results.
[3107.60 → 3107.66] Okay.
[3107.66 → 3110.16] Is it our last poll?
[3110.22 → 3111.18] This is our last one.
[3111.32 → 3111.58] Because.
[3111.72 → 3112.38] Oh, what now?
[3112.80 → 3118.64] The tote at 16% of the vote could individually decide any of the three remaining.
[3118.98 → 3120.74] So should we do one more with the three?
[3120.84 → 3121.54] No, just two.
[3121.76 → 3122.04] Just two.
[3122.04 → 3122.78] We're going down to the top.
[3122.94 → 3123.70] Oh, I see.
[3123.94 → 3124.12] Yeah.
[3124.12 → 3127.74] Because there's a 1% difference and 16% of the votes are on tote.
[3129.22 → 3132.36] So we'll like actually completely change which one ends up in the final.
[3132.62 → 3132.64] Okay.
[3132.76 → 3134.28] Linus tech tote is out.
[3134.86 → 3135.64] New poll.
[3136.02 → 3144.58] It's tech sack at 26% of the vote versus LTT bag at 24% versus Pouch McPouchface at 35.
[3144.58 → 3147.18] Are we picking just the winner of that?
[3147.28 → 3148.96] Are we doing another final round?
[3149.10 → 3150.12] Because here's a question.
[3150.36 → 3151.28] We could leave out.
[3151.48 → 3153.36] Pouch is clearly going to be in the final.
[3153.94 → 3157.00] So we could do a poll just against tech sack and LTT bag.
[3157.38 → 3157.84] No, no.
[3157.90 → 3160.58] Let's leave Pouch McPouchface in.
[3160.82 → 3161.06] Okay.
[3161.32 → 3161.48] Yeah.
[3161.56 → 3162.40] I can just.
[3163.10 → 3163.50] Yeah.
[3163.68 → 3163.86] Yeah.
[3163.86 → 3165.24] Let's leave the three options in.
[3165.38 → 3166.28] We'll leave the three options in.
[3166.28 → 3166.84] Is this the final poll?
[3167.44 → 3169.24] Let's make this the final countdown.
[3169.48 → 3169.70] Okay.
[3169.94 → 3170.92] Do-do-do-do.
[3170.98 → 3178.08] So because there's the concern here because the non-pouches are split.
[3178.90 → 3179.44] I see.
[3180.12 → 3180.38] Okay.
[3180.42 → 3181.40] I think if you end it.
[3181.40 → 3181.64] Fine.
[3181.72 → 3184.52] With multiple non-poach options, it guarantees a poach win.
[3184.52 → 3185.12] Fine, Luke.
[3185.12 → 3188.96] We will do the three-way vote, and then we will do a two-way final.
[3189.16 → 3194.96] It's going to last the whole show, which is really impressive because WAN show is like four hours now.
[3194.96 → 3198.14] It's ridiculous.
[3199.08 → 3201.08] Why does WAN show four hours?
[3201.24 → 3202.28] We've got to fix this.
[3202.58 → 3202.90] Okay.
[3202.92 → 3203.28] That's it.
[3203.32 → 3203.96] WAN show is done.
[3204.04 → 3204.20] Bye.
[3205.24 → 3205.70] No, I'm kidding.
[3205.74 → 3205.90] Nope.
[3206.00 → 3206.34] I'm kidding.
[3206.40 → 3206.80] I'm not done.
[3206.86 → 3208.64] There's so much more to talk about this week.
[3208.70 → 3208.84] Yep.
[3209.08 → 3211.06] How were you not able to find topics to?
[3211.62 → 3211.98] Oh.
[3212.34 → 3213.36] Oh, this is great.
[3213.58 → 3213.88] Okay.
[3214.36 → 3218.16] I guess we're going to talk about more LTT store stuff because this is super exciting.
[3218.16 → 3219.10] That's why I couldn't find topics.
[3219.28 → 3222.88] What we've been talking about other than Ring, which I didn't want to talk about because I hate that.
[3222.88 → 3230.70] I mean, it's fair to talk about on the show, but I just, I just, we've been saying for so many years not to do it because of this reason that just happened.
[3230.70 → 3233.98] So it's just like, it's good to talk about.
[3234.02 → 3234.78] It's just frustrating.
[3235.50 → 3236.24] Actually, you know what?
[3236.26 → 3240.28] Let's get the sponsors out of the way, and then we will, and then we will get to the next thing.
[3240.50 → 3241.88] I'm actually very excited about the sponsors.
[3242.68 → 3244.12] You're excited about the sponsors.
[3244.32 → 3244.68] I am.
[3244.76 → 3247.46] Since when are you excited for sponsors, Mr. Privateer?
[3247.50 → 3248.80] Because there's a Dennis integration.
[3249.08 → 3249.74] Oh no.
[3250.62 → 3251.18] Wait, what is this?
[3251.18 → 3252.38] All Dennis integrations?
[3252.74 → 3253.44] What is this?
[3254.22 → 3254.94] Let's go.
[3255.10 → 3256.22] Dan's got a bunch.
[3256.26 → 3257.86] He's got paperwork over there.
[3258.42 → 3269.18] So the thing that we're using for Wan show now, the new software that we're using for Wan show, stores all the, the, um, the sources in like VRAM.
[3269.66 → 3270.04] I see.
[3270.08 → 3271.52] So it's like really quick and stable and stuff.
[3271.66 → 3271.98] Uh-huh.
[3271.98 → 3276.76] It is like filled the card with stuff that Dennis made for this, for these ad spots.
[3277.58 → 3281.42] The VRAM is like, oh, it's like seven gigs of, of seven gigs of VRAM.
[3281.54 → 3283.96] I have, uh, 78 sources.
[3284.90 → 3287.40] Uh, anyway, do you want to do your sponsor reads?
[3287.44 → 3288.46] I've been practicing all day.
[3288.46 → 3293.34] They're worth it.
[3293.34 → 3294.34] Okay.
[3294.34 → 3295.34] Okay.

[3298.98 → 3304.12] If your math is as bad as mine, you will need FreshBooks.
[3304.28 → 3306.26] Minus, I know you're not that good with math.

[3355.44 → 3356.56] You got a whole script of it?
[3356.68 → 3356.90] Okay.
[3357.08 → 3357.18] Yeah.
[3357.56 → 3358.06] Hold on a second.
[3358.46 → 3363.48] How many hours today did we, did we dedicate to these WAN show sponsors spots?
[3364.06 → 3364.30] Hmm.
[3364.92 → 3365.42] 30 minutes.
[3366.20 → 3366.64] Oh, okay.
[3366.66 → 3368.14] You said you spent all day practicing.
[3368.14 → 3369.26] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3370.36 → 3371.64] But it only took 30 minutes.
[3371.80 → 3372.98] No, it's hyperbole.
[3373.82 → 3374.18] Okay.

[3455.66 → 3456.52] Can he do that?

[3458.86 → 3459.20] I honestly don't.
[3459.30 → 3461.32] I have 34 different buttons.
[3461.34 → 3462.10] Oh, no, it's centred.
[3462.24 → 3462.74] It's just my angle.

[3471.56 → 3472.14] All right.
[3472.34 → 3474.16] Finally, the show is brought to you by Squarespace.

[3483.72 → 3484.36] That's really helpful.
[3484.82 → 3485.78] May seem daunting.

[3532.50 → 3540.22] Thank you, Dennis, very much for the helpful additions to our otherwise bland and boring sponsor reads on the show.
[3540.22 → 3544.02] We did have some frame rate issues.
[3544.42 → 3545.88] Yes, I did notice that.
[3545.90 → 3550.96] Next time that you trial stuff like that, you need to trial it while live encoding.
[3552.24 → 3552.66] Yeah.
[3552.82 → 3553.32] All right.
[3553.34 → 3554.08] We'll figure it out.
[3555.02 → 3555.98] Holy crap.
[3556.06 → 3557.88] This is a close three-way race.
[3557.90 → 3559.22] So that's why I didn't want to include Pouch.
[3559.22 → 3559.60] Wow.
[3559.94 → 3563.68] Because I knew Pouch was going to win this, but then the remaining two are so close.
[3564.04 → 3567.06] Tech Sack at 33% of the vote.
[3567.06 → 3570.78] LTT Bag at 30% of the vote.
[3571.04 → 3575.32] And Pouch McPouchface at just 36% of the vote.
[3575.60 → 3575.82] Yeah.
[3576.18 → 3579.08] So it's Tech Sack versus Pouch McPouchface.
[3579.08 → 3579.38] All right.
[3579.66 → 3580.60] Let's go.
[3581.20 → 3582.18] Let's go.
[3582.72 → 3583.34] Last poll.
[3583.88 → 3584.60] Excuse me.
[3584.70 → 3585.28] Last poll.
[3586.56 → 3588.88] Hey, we should do a couple of merch messages.
[3589.06 → 3592.38] For those of you who are new to the WAN show, which seems to be a lot of you today,
[3592.46 → 3596.00] we've got 21,000 live viewers over on YouTube.
[3596.00 → 3598.00] We've got...
[3598.00 → 3598.92] Twitch is slow.
[3599.48 → 3600.66] One moment, please.
[3600.80 → 3601.84] My dashboard is loading.
[3602.78 → 3603.58] Holy crap.
[3603.64 → 3604.62] This is really slow.
[3605.08 → 3606.68] 5,600 over on Twitch.
[3606.86 → 3611.30] And I have no idea how many are watching on Float plane because we still don't have a
[3611.30 → 3613.76] c*** dang view counter.
[3614.80 → 3615.06] Get owned.
[3615.06 → 3615.66] Get owned.
[3615.66 → 3616.52] You get owned.
[3617.22 → 3617.96] Own yourself.
[3617.96 → 3618.06] Oh.
[3618.94 → 3619.46] Anyway.
[3620.06 → 3622.16] So yeah, we've got a lot of new people watching.
[3622.48 → 3628.30] The way to interact with the show is not through super chats.
[3628.50 → 3630.20] I almost said merch messages.
[3630.78 → 3631.64] Not through super chats.
[3631.84 → 3632.74] Not through Twitch bits.
[3633.12 → 3634.06] It's merch messages.
[3634.06 → 3639.88] And what makes them superior to super chats and Twitch bits is that while just like those
[3639.88 → 3645.54] methods, you can absolutely throw your money at the screen for no reason other than hoping
[3645.54 → 3650.84] for acknowledgement from people that you only know through a little screen in front
[3650.84 → 3651.18] of you.
[3651.18 → 3657.02] Not only that, but in case we don't get to your message or just even if we do, instead
[3657.02 → 3662.46] of just like lining Google or Amazon's pockets, you will get merchandise in the mail.
[3662.56 → 3667.50] Water bottles, desk pads, whatever we're going to call this thing that holds tech stuff
[3667.50 → 3668.84] and is a pouch.
[3670.34 → 3671.22] Oh, oh man.
[3671.24 → 3674.80] We've got a new product to announce today that I'm so excited about.
[3674.84 → 3675.66] We'll talk about that later.
[3675.76 → 3676.36] Do we have multiple?
[3676.96 → 3677.64] No, no.
[3677.70 → 3678.02] Just one.
[3678.12 → 3678.40] Oh, okay.
[3678.40 → 3682.60] The point is that if you send a merch message, just go to lttstore.com and in the checkout,
[3683.00 → 3684.06] you can send a merch message.
[3684.14 → 3685.40] It'll either pop up down there.
[3685.70 → 3686.78] Dan might reply to you.
[3686.90 → 3689.40] We might reply to your message live on the show.
[3689.80 → 3693.36] And even if none of that happens, you will definitely still get your order in the mail
[3693.36 → 3695.38] and we make lots of really, perfect stuff.
[3695.46 → 3697.44] So head over to lttstore.com.
[3698.40 → 3698.68] All right.
[3698.70 → 3701.06] Do you want to hit us with a couple of merch messages, Dan, before we move on?
[3701.34 → 3702.74] The first one I have here is from Michael.
[3703.08 → 3707.48] Speaking of building moats last week, do you think that there's still space on tech YouTube
[3707.48 → 3712.98] for new channels to even come close as big, as popular as you guys or others like MKBHD?
[3714.08 → 3715.58] I would have said no.
[3716.12 → 3719.28] And then Mr. Who's the Boss broke out big.
[3719.46 → 3723.06] I was actually literally going to say yes, specifically because of him.
[3723.16 → 3723.34] Yeah.
[3723.54 → 3725.94] He proved it to me that it's possible.
[3726.14 → 3726.92] It's hard.
[3727.04 → 3727.94] It's not easy.
[3728.08 → 3728.38] Yeah.
[3728.38 → 3728.94] Yeah.
[3729.28 → 3736.74] Like it's a funny thing because as the platform has matured and as the tools to create video
[3736.74 → 3743.76] have become more and more accessible, like, man, the production values you can get for $1,000
[3743.76 → 3749.64] today are better than what you could do for probably $10,000 back when we started.
[3749.64 → 3756.76] Honestly, like really, particularly in spaces like lighting, lighting has gotten cheap.
[3757.02 → 3761.90] It's incredible what you can do with cheap lighting these days.
[3762.26 → 3765.20] Like you can get high CRY bulbs at Home Depot now.
[3765.56 → 3770.68] You know, that's the kind of thing that just didn't exist 10 years ago, right?
[3770.68 → 3777.34] And, but what's funny is that as access to the tools and as the strength of the platform
[3777.34 → 3783.30] overall has gotten better, the competition has also gotten fiercer.
[3783.50 → 3789.26] So I would say that today it is easier than ever to have a video blow up.
[3789.38 → 3792.92] Like YouTube algorithmically is so powerful.
[3792.92 → 3801.92] Um, but I would say that today it's as hard as ever to build momentum.
[3801.92 → 3802.48] Yes.
[3802.60 → 3805.68] To build a large, to build a large channel, to build a team.
[3805.78 → 3806.52] Yeah, exactly.
[3807.14 → 3810.56] So it's, it's a it's a tough.
[3810.78 → 3814.84] Cause you, you might be able to hit, like if you have one concept that you've been sitting
[3814.84 → 3819.90] on for years, and you make like one really sick video, you might be able to hit with one
[3819.90 → 3825.42] video, but, but continuing that, keeping the role going, being able to release not only
[3825.42 → 3830.92] like one, two or three more, but being able to release one, two or 300 more is really hard.
[3831.30 → 3833.28] And you have to be there for the whole time.
[3833.90 → 3838.76] By the way, the poll is really slowing down in terms of votes that are coming in.
[3838.82 → 3840.72] We're only getting one or two trickling in at a time.
[3840.72 → 3842.44] And I think, I think we have a winner.
[3842.92 → 3847.50] It looks like it's going to be tech sack.
[3847.50 → 3849.94] By 4% of the vote.
[3849.94 → 3850.82] By 4%.
[3850.82 → 3851.92] Wow.
[3854.06 → 3855.00] That was very close.
[3855.26 → 3855.44] Yeah.
[3856.54 → 3858.32] We can leave it running, but like, I don't.
[3858.38 → 3859.42] Yeah, we can let it run a little longer.
[3859.54 → 3859.66] Yeah.
[3860.06 → 3861.74] I don't think it's going to change much at this point.
[3863.50 → 3864.58] What were we talking about again?
[3864.78 → 3865.06] Right.
[3865.26 → 3865.48] Yeah.
[3865.58 → 3865.78] Yeah.
[3865.84 → 3866.52] Could you break out?
[3866.60 → 3870.60] So yeah, I, I would have said, I would have said no until.
[3871.92 → 3874.06] I think we have said no in the past.
[3874.16 → 3874.30] Yeah.
[3874.30 → 3874.50] Yeah.
[3874.90 → 3875.14] Yeah.
[3875.14 → 3880.54] I think, because I, and I will tell you that initially I thought the question was, can you
[3880.54 → 3883.56] still like, can you still break out in the tech space?
[3883.56 → 3886.22] And for that, the answer is absolutely yes.
[3886.34 → 3891.86] Because I think the future of the platform is many niche channels.
[3892.02 → 3892.20] Yeah.
[3892.36 → 3898.66] More than these, like, you know, like I see us kind of like a department store channel.
[3898.66 → 3905.06] Uh, and I think that we've seen a shift culturally away from the one-stop shop, away from the
[3905.06 → 3907.84] department store into the niche experts.
[3908.04 → 3911.12] And that's a big part of the reason why we're growing our team.
[3911.20 → 3912.28] That's why we're building the lab.
[3912.28 → 3917.72] That's why we're hiring engineers and subject-matter experts so that when it's time for
[3917.72 → 3923.96] us to really get laser focused on niches, whether they're a display or, uh, you know,
[3924.04 → 3928.88] CPU, GPU, or cooling or whatever it is, we're properly equipped for it.
[3928.88 → 3935.80] Because I think that a niche that has a hundred thousand people that are super dialled into
[3935.80 → 3943.78] it is way, way easier to tackle these days than trying to, uh, than trying to make broadly
[3943.78 → 3948.88] appealing tech content to try to hit a million or 2 million or 10 million people.
[3948.88 → 3955.12] Um, especially when there are so many channels that are doing that broad content so well, because
[3955.12 → 3956.14] it's not just us.
[3956.14 → 3959.34] You have to, I mean, you already mentioned MKBHD, right?
[3959.38 → 3960.66] So you're going up against us.
[3960.70 → 3961.82] You're going up against Marquez.
[3961.92 → 3963.30] You're going up against Aaron.
[3963.40 → 3965.68] You're going up against a Jay's two cents and Austin.
[3965.82 → 3967.48] You're going up against all these folks.
[3967.62 → 3969.96] You just list names for like 20 minutes.
[3970.10 → 3970.28] Yeah.
[3970.28 → 3970.94] There's so many.
[3971.08 → 3976.26] And then if you, if you went on for long enough, you might end up with the, uh, the creators
[3976.26 → 3977.24] we're hoping to have at LTX.
[3977.36 → 3977.58] Sorry.
[3977.80 → 3980.64] Uh, well, we will confirm those eventually for you guys.
[3980.64 → 3983.92] We just need approval from these folks to tell you who's going to be coming.
[3983.92 → 3988.52] But if you, so if you asked me that, I'd say, you know, yeah, breaking out in a niche, no
[3988.52 → 3995.14] problem, but building a mega channel, man, I'm not going to say that I didn't work hard.
[3995.32 → 4002.22] I'm not going to say you didn't work hard, but we would be just dishonest if we didn't
[4002.22 → 4005.48] acknowledge that there was a significant degree of right place, right time.
[4005.66 → 4005.78] Yeah.
[4006.62 → 4007.34] And you know what?
[4007.38 → 4008.80] It's always kind of funny to me.
[4008.80 → 4015.00] Having access to NCX was such a huge, even back then I thought the ship had sailed and
[4015.00 → 4018.26] it wasn't that, it wasn't that stupid of a thought, right?
[4018.58 → 4021.34] Like think back to when, when the channel started.
[4021.40 → 4022.42] So what was, what was, what was that?
[4023.14 → 4026.22] 2009, we uploaded the first NCI tech tips video.
[4026.22 → 4036.32] So back then, I mean, how long did web startup, you know, social platforms exist for?
[4037.40 → 4041.98] Nothing had lasted as long as, what, 2009 to the 14 years.
[4042.40 → 4045.94] Nothing, or so I think YouTube started in 2006, something like that.
[4046.20 → 4051.22] So, so nothing, nothing lasted, you know, 17, 18 years.
[4051.22 → 4057.08] So for me to look at it and go, yeah, I'm, I'm three years, I'm four years late to the
[4057.08 → 4065.78] party, you know, PC whiz kid and a chillafrilla and locker gnome, you know, these folks have
[4065.78 → 4067.14] all got it on lock, right?
[4067.16 → 4071.04] Like how could I possibly hope to break into this space?
[4071.18 → 4071.34] Yeah.
[4071.48 → 4076.66] It wasn't even that stupid a thing for me to think, especially with the importance of
[4076.66 → 4079.20] subscribers back in that time, right?
[4079.20 → 4084.82] Once you had that critical mass, well, how else could anyone possibly hope to get on the
[4084.82 → 4085.30] homepage?
[4086.96 → 4087.24] Yeah.
[4087.90 → 4089.74] You know, things that mattered back then.
[4091.76 → 4093.44] But I ended up being wrong.
[4093.66 → 4094.80] So I could be wrong again.
[4095.56 → 4101.52] Maybe the next big, all you can eat tech channel is brewing in the mind of someone who's watching
[4101.52 → 4102.36] the show right now.
[4102.66 → 4105.16] There's also like, there's also other platforms.
[4105.16 → 4113.30] I'm pretty sure they said specifically YouTube, but like, I think one of the reasons why, why
[4113.30 → 4116.68] we did get a start and why a lot of other creators around that time got a start is people were
[4116.68 → 4118.94] slowly shifting away from TV at the time.
[4119.24 → 4119.50] Absolutely.
[4119.84 → 4121.34] Something similar could happen to YouTube.
[4121.46 → 4125.62] Maybe I don't necessarily, it doesn't really feel like it is TikTok, but maybe there's something
[4125.62 → 4125.96] that comes around.
[4125.96 → 4128.54] No, especially not if that North or that US ban goes through.
[4128.64 → 4128.94] Yeah.
[4129.26 → 4130.98] But like something, something might happen.
[4131.06 → 4131.44] Who knows?
[4131.54 → 4131.72] Yep.
[4131.72 → 4134.78] Who knows what's going to happen in the world of apps or other potential websites.
[4135.72 → 4144.54] And then content types, like the tech that we talk about, what is going to be out there
[4144.54 → 4145.02] eventually?
[4145.44 → 4146.92] We're talking about AR stuff.
[4147.00 → 4148.96] We're talking about these weird AI integrations.
[4149.04 → 4151.40] We don't know the direction that either of those things are going to go.
[4151.88 → 4156.80] And maybe you are a fantastic source for whatever that ends up being.
[4156.80 → 4157.70] And that can be your niche.
[4159.10 → 4159.64] Who knows?
[4160.06 → 4160.26] Yeah.
[4160.26 → 4160.32] Yeah.
[4160.40 → 4161.00] A hundred percent.
[4162.22 → 4166.34] Um, the float plane chat is hilarious right now.
[4166.34 → 4167.18] Absolutely right.
[4167.48 → 4169.50] Hashtag not my sack.
[4169.72 → 4171.04] Stop the sack.
[4171.40 → 4171.92] Recount.
[4173.00 → 4173.56] Impeachment.
[4176.06 → 4177.56] What are you guys, Florida?
[4179.24 → 4179.76] Okay.
[4179.80 → 4180.76] That's an old joke.
[4180.86 → 4184.66] That's like going back to, uh, what's his, what's his nuts?
[4184.76 → 4186.54] Like Gore, Gore Bush or whatever.
[4186.54 → 4191.04] Um, any who bring me pouch or bring me dad.
[4191.76 → 4192.44] Oh no.
[4192.54 → 4192.76] Okay.
[4192.76 → 4193.30] We're going back.
[4193.50 → 4193.84] You guys should do.
[4193.94 → 4194.36] Oh no.
[4194.44 → 4197.88] I don't think it would be worth the run, but you guys should do a version that has like
[4197.88 → 4201.50] a smiley face on it and do like a limited run of poach Mc Poach faces.
[4202.14 → 4203.14] It's probably not worth it.
[4203.14 → 4209.70] Speaking of run, um, uh, Mr. Wage posted in float plane chat at Silicon Valley Bank, north
[4209.70 → 4217.04] of 93% of the bank's 161 billion in deposits are apparently uninsured per a recent regulatory
[4217.04 → 4217.72] filing.
[4220.60 → 4221.12] Whoa.
[4221.36 → 4222.42] Anyway, sorry.
[4222.58 → 4224.82] Um, want to hit us with another merch message, Dan?
[4225.38 → 4226.72] Uh, yeah, absolutely.
[4227.16 → 4229.14] Uh, oh, sorry.
[4229.20 → 4231.34] I'm going to say what you just said, but I'm going to say it through the mic.
[4231.42 → 4234.94] The tech sack is apparently back up on the store under the name tech sack.
[4235.04 → 4235.76] That was fast.
[4235.94 → 4236.54] Oh, what?
[4236.96 → 4237.40] It's up.
[4237.64 → 4239.44] Uh, no one has informed me of that.
[4239.50 → 4240.22] That doesn't seem right.
[4240.48 → 4241.10] It is up though.
[4242.00 → 4243.32] Uh, looking at it right now.
[4244.60 → 4245.00] Okay.
[4246.58 → 4248.60] Um, okay.
[4248.78 → 4249.72] Uh, okay.
[4249.88 → 4250.48] Well, okay.
[4250.48 → 4251.84] Nick, it's, it's tech sack.
[4251.98 → 4254.36] Uh, if you're watching, uh, tech sack.
[4254.36 → 4255.54] No, it's as tech sack.
[4255.74 → 4256.42] Oh, it's tech sack.
[4256.52 → 4256.62] Yeah.
[4256.76 → 4257.36] Oh, so it's up.
[4257.54 → 4257.70] Yeah.
[4258.30 → 4259.14] Did I not say it?
[4259.20 → 4261.54] No, I think I, uh, I might've misspoke.
[4261.66 → 4261.98] I don't know.
[4262.10 → 4263.18] No, yeah, you probably didn't.
[4263.24 → 4263.46] Okay.
[4263.50 → 4263.62] Yeah.
[4263.62 → 4263.98] All good.
[4264.08 → 4264.32] All right.
[4264.40 → 4265.98] It's, it's officially tech sack now.
[4265.98 → 4269.90] So if you want to, um, get my sack in the mail, then you can order it.
[4270.30 → 4271.30] Float plane is not happy.
[4272.28 → 4272.64] Yeah.
[4272.72 → 4274.30] Float plane, Float plane's never happy.
[4274.46 → 4278.98] It's funny because the more people love us, it seems like the more angry they get with us.
[4279.14 → 4279.36] Yeah.
[4279.62 → 4279.86] Yeah.
[4279.86 → 4283.40] And, and like, we, we love you back, Float plane, and we're never angry with you.
[4284.36 → 4288.36] Can I, can I take a moment to just shout out a couple, a couple of people?
[4288.48 → 4294.52] First, shout out the Float plane peeps who happen to be 32,254 strong these days.
[4294.52 → 4294.80] Yeah.
[4294.80 → 4299.18] And then I'd also like to take a moment to shout out the social team because they have
[4299.18 → 4305.94] been absolutely annihilating their targets for Float plane exclusive content these days.
[4306.02 → 4310.92] Not, not in terms of like the volume there, they, they, they hit the volume targets, but
[4310.92 → 4314.92] they are crushing it in terms of the quality of the exclusives that we've been uploading.
[4315.28 → 4317.48] Um, this, this one was perfect.
[4317.48 → 4320.84] Uh, they were hanging out with the engineers over in Creator Warehouse.
[4320.98 → 4329.50] Just a casual 99.5% like-dislike ratio on this test run with our desktop injection older.
[4329.94 → 4334.90] Um, it's just really cool to see some of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes here that
[4334.90 → 4339.32] normally wouldn't get any, any exposure being appreciated.
[4339.60 → 4340.88] There's a meet the team with Yvonne, right?
[4340.88 → 4345.86] Yeah, that one actually went up on LMG clips as a promotion for Float plane and I think
[4345.86 → 4349.48] it's going to stay up for either hours or a day or two or something like that.
[4349.48 → 4354.06] But Float plane is full of meet the teams with like, I think like dozen, literally dozens
[4354.06 → 4355.34] of members of the team at this point.
[4355.86 → 4359.62] Um, Kyle's is a recent one that has been very, very popular.
[4359.82 → 4361.04] This is a sidebar thing.
[4361.04 → 4365.50] Because it's not, it's not us, but a garbage time also passed 3000 subscribers.
[4366.10 → 4366.86] Let's go.
[4367.10 → 4368.00] Let's go.
[4368.72 → 4369.20] All right.
[4369.28 → 4370.76] Dan hit me with another merge message.
[4370.88 → 4371.40] Okay.
[4371.68 → 4372.76] I've got another one here.
[4372.90 → 4377.48] Hey guys, since more OLED monitors are being made, is there really a point to getting one
[4377.48 → 4382.88] for somebody who plays mostly first-person shooters and cranks the shadows up, thus negating
[4382.88 → 4384.30] one of the points of an OLED?
[4385.60 → 4387.40] Wait, how does that negate?
[4387.58 → 4392.76] So cranking the shadows up, I can see where you're coming from, right?
[4392.76 → 4399.08] Like if you, if you lift, uh, the dark parts of the image so that you can more easily
[4399.08 → 4400.08] identify opponents.
[4400.08 → 4401.44] I misinterpreted this.
[4401.52 → 4401.74] Yeah.
[4401.86 → 4404.00] I, I see where you're coming from.
[4404.12 → 4407.22] If all you ever do is play FPS games.
[4408.02 → 4408.70] Get a CRT.
[4408.70 → 4416.52] Well, uh, no, no, no, I, I would still go OLED because from a gaming perspective, the biggest
[4416.52 → 4420.14] benefit of OLED is not the contrast or the colour accuracy.
[4420.14 → 4425.10] Cause like you said, you know, for a competitive edge, many gamers will totally mess with their
[4425.10 → 4428.44] colours or their, or their contrast or whatever else, the gamma curves and all that.
[4428.44 → 4435.84] Um, but from a pixel persisted, like an image persistence standpoint, from a pixel response
[4435.84 → 4443.32] time standpoint, nothing else modern, like I'm not, yeah, CRTs aside, nothing else modern
[4443.32 → 4446.14] even comes close to touching an OLED.
[4446.72 → 4452.36] Um, so the clarity of the image, particularly during fat, fast movements, like if you are,
[4452.44 → 4457.44] if you're whipping the mouse, uh, is so much higher than an LCD that I would rather have a
[4457.44 → 4459.76] 240 Hertz OLED over a 500 Hertz LCD.
[4460.30 → 4464.76] I say that out of ignorance though, because we haven't yet been actually hands-on with
[4464.76 → 4465.66] a 500 Hertz LCD.
[4465.80 → 4471.72] I think we're going to get to check it out soon, but that's how I feel about it right
[4471.72 → 4472.02] now.
[4472.54 → 4475.28] Really, really love OLED gaming.
[4475.46 → 4480.22] And it's all about that lightning fast pixel response time and image clarity in motion.
[4483.04 → 4486.34] Hit me with one more, and then we'll, we'll get to some more topics here.
[4486.46 → 4487.06] The last one.
[4487.06 → 4487.48] All right.
[4487.60 → 4491.74] I'm about to deploy another Stratus FT server for work.
[4491.98 → 4493.42] Are you basically run here?
[4493.42 → 4494.60] Because I don't know about that.
[4494.96 → 4496.80] Oh, uh, sorry, Luke.
[4497.52 → 4499.92] Uh, uh, okay.
[4500.02 → 4500.76] Uh, merch message.
[4500.86 → 4501.08] Okay.
[4501.28 → 4502.70] Uh, this is from anonymous.
[4502.92 → 4506.80] Uh, anyway, they basically run the CPUs and RAM in raid one.
[4506.94 → 4510.04] What's your favourite fault-tolerant high availability equipment?
[4511.62 → 4513.70] Oh, that's a difficult question.
[4513.70 → 4515.02] Yeah, man.
[4515.02 → 4524.02] I got to say, I was, I was really blown away when I visited IBM and I got to get hands-on
[4524.02 → 4524.90] with IBM Z.
[4524.90 → 4534.12] Cause on the one hand, I look at a product like IBM Z and I go, there has got to be a more
[4534.12 → 4542.40] economical, open source, like way to do this with off the shelf, like super micro servers
[4542.40 → 4544.24] running in a cluster or something.
[4544.24 → 4550.64] You know, like the, the, the geek in me is sitting here going, this seems like yesterday's
[4550.64 → 4551.62] solution tomorrow.
[4551.82 → 4552.44] You know what I mean?
[4552.44 → 4560.74] Are they really engineering an entire CPU for one system for like six customers?
[4561.08 → 4565.04] Like, is it, is this really the best way to, you know, like that's, that's kind of my,
[4565.06 → 4570.78] my gut feeling, but then you go, and you look kind of like you're talking about, you look
[4570.78 → 4578.08] at the way that they build, you know, raid one directly onto a onto like into a, a, a
[4578.08 → 4583.86] memory subsystem, or you look at the way that you can literally just yank mains power out
[4583.86 → 4584.46] of this thing.
[4584.46 → 4586.72] And it completely doesn't notice.
[4587.30 → 4589.96] And it's, it's pretty cool.
[4590.20 → 4596.52] I would say that if you want to see me kind of geek out over, over fault tolerance, that's
[4596.52 → 4599.74] the video to go watch because those things are, what is it?
[4599.78 → 4602.68] Four nines they target something stupid like that.
[4602.68 → 4606.42] I'm not sure off the top of my head, but I forget how many nines do you, while I look
[4606.42 → 4608.24] it up, you want to explain the concept of nines?
[4609.40 → 4614.40] Uh, oh, it's, it's like basically when you're, when you're looking at something like uptime,
[4614.54 → 4621.52] uh, if you have 99.9%, well, if you look at an entire year, the 0.1% that's remaining
[4621.52 → 4623.90] is actually a pretty significant amount of time.
[4623.98 → 4630.76] So you want to increase your amount of nines, because if you go from 99.9 to 99.99, that's
[4630.76 → 4633.66] actually a very significant reduction in downtime that you just had.
[4633.66 → 4638.42] So increasing the if you, if you say like four nines, that's the amount of nines past
[4638.42 → 4640.00] the decimal point that you have.
[4640.08 → 4641.84] So having more nines is better.
[4642.08 → 4643.38] IBM Z reliability.
[4643.76 → 4648.50] Four Z15s, their commitment is seven nines.
[4648.76 → 4652.98] So on average, 3.2 seconds of downtime per year.
[4655.24 → 4655.82] Yeah.
[4655.90 → 4656.84] See like that's sick.
[4657.04 → 4660.02] That's actually kind of stupid.
[4660.02 → 4660.50] Yeah.
[4660.50 → 4661.56] That's kind of amazing.
[4661.74 → 4664.52] Um, and so, yeah, it was, it was really cool.
[4664.52 → 4670.16] Not just seeing the hardware and like pulling cords out of it or whatever, but some of what
[4670.16 → 4674.56] didn't make it into the video, unfortunately, just, just like talking to the people who work
[4674.56 → 4679.70] on and who designed these systems was, was very cool because it's a it's a completely
[4679.70 → 4681.40] different mindset.
[4681.40 → 4684.56] Like you talk about running RAM in raid one, right?
[4684.96 → 4692.56] I think to the average gamer, if I said, Hey, you can experience three minutes less downtime
[4692.56 → 4699.92] per year and all it'll cost you is spending $600 instead of $300 on your memory.
[4700.12 → 4703.10] They'd look at you like you're an idiot.
[4703.58 → 4703.80] Right.
[4704.00 → 4705.12] It includes the first two nines.
[4705.56 → 4706.30] Oh, okay.
[4707.02 → 4708.98] I've been referring to that incorrectly for a hot minute.
[4709.12 → 4709.40] All right.
[4709.40 → 4712.18] My bad at any rate, seven, nine still wild.
[4712.40 → 4712.52] Yeah.
[4712.60 → 4713.54] Um, five passages.
[4714.06 → 4714.36] Yeah.
[4715.14 → 4716.86] Um, why would you include the first two?
[4717.16 → 4717.46] Whatever.
[4718.78 → 4719.66] Hold on a second.
[4720.02 → 4725.06] If it doesn't start with 99, you're having some problems.
[4725.92 → 4726.30] Yeah.
[4726.32 → 4728.24] Apparently it does include the first whatever.
[4728.40 → 4730.16] So that is five nines past the decimal.
[4730.22 → 4730.90] That's still wild.
[4731.10 → 4734.96] Anyway, the point is if you told the average gamer, Hey, you can spend twice as much on your
[4734.96 → 4737.52] memory, and it'll save you three minutes of downtime a year.
[4737.52 → 4739.96] Well, they, they, they tell you're an idiot.
[4740.12 → 4742.56] Like, no, I think I can handle what, what is that?
[4742.64 → 4747.54] Two game crashes over a span of 365 days is probably okay.
[4747.54 → 4749.00] And I'll save my few hundred dollars.
[4749.48 → 4757.64] But when three minutes of downtime could back up all of your client systems or cause some
[4757.64 → 4760.12] kind of catastrophic system fail.
[4760.20 → 4760.44] Okay.
[4760.82 → 4762.30] Oh, perfect example of this.
[4762.40 → 4765.12] When the Canadian debit infrastructure went down.
[4765.94 → 4766.40] You remember that?
[4766.40 → 4766.62] Yeah.
[4766.88 → 4771.94] Or, or when, when, uh, our Rogers, uh, telco, man, I'm making Canada sound like some kind
[4771.94 → 4772.58] of backwater.
[4772.72 → 4774.10] It's just the things we're more aware of.
[4774.10 → 4774.38] Yeah.
[4774.60 → 4779.56] Um, or when, uh, so Rogers communications had a down, had downtime for like a day.
[4779.64 → 4784.52] And my understanding is in the postmortem to that, it basically came down to like one
[4784.52 → 4789.52] system, you know, managed by one person, like had something went wrong with it.
[4789.76 → 4793.54] It's, it's actually kind of amazing how patchwork our systems are.
[4793.54 → 4794.12] I mean, okay.
[4794.12 → 4795.44] For an example, not in Canada.
[4795.44 → 4796.16] Okay.
[4796.16 → 4800.24] You get like one bank that, that disappears in the States.
[4800.24 → 4802.84] And all of a sudden it's like, oh, okay.
[4803.22 → 4805.78] Uh, well, the Silicon Valley startup scene has no money.
[4805.78 → 4806.50] So that's cool.
[4808.88 → 4809.36] Right.
[4809.72 → 4817.52] Like the, the, the way that the world is architected for very few points of failure that can take
[4817.52 → 4818.34] down the entire system.
[4818.68 → 4822.34] I've said this many times and I don't know, maybe this is a dumb thing to talk about on
[4822.34 → 4829.98] a podcast, but like if a terrorist wanted to really harm the city of Vancouver, okay.
[4830.12 → 4831.28] Oh, uh, hmm.
[4831.52 → 4832.34] Uh, hmm.
[4832.34 → 4834.76] All they got to do is take out like two bridges.
[4835.56 → 4836.68] We've had this conversation.
[4836.68 → 4841.14] The entire region would grind to a halt.
[4841.40 → 4846.74] I'm talking no commerce, no food, like nothing.
[4847.00 → 4848.50] We have, we have nothing.
[4849.54 → 4850.28] There's, well, there's.
[4850.42 → 4851.44] It's mind-blowing.
[4851.44 → 4852.90] There's that South Park joke.
[4853.08 → 4856.32] Uh, I love telling people about this where they talk about the one road in Canada.
[4857.04 → 4858.36] Follow the only road.
[4858.50 → 4858.82] Yeah.
[4858.98 → 4862.98] And then you realize that like at certain parts of the country, there is one road.
[4864.26 → 4867.94] Highway one is actually a very big deal up here.
[4867.94 → 4872.86] And when like a bridge goes down, and it happens to be in that area where there is just one
[4872.86 → 4875.30] road, like Canada is split in half temporarily.
[4875.64 → 4875.78] Yeah.
[4875.78 → 4880.78] Uh, interprovincial shipping is actually done.
[4880.78 → 4882.90] It's, it's, it's, it's out.
[4883.16 → 4883.60] Yeah.
[4884.24 → 4886.74] Um, pontoon bridges for the wind, say people.
[4886.82 → 4889.88] There are places where I don't think it would be feasible.
[4889.88 → 4893.46] How would you put in a pontoon bridge to replace the port man?
[4893.68 → 4894.86] I don't think so.
[4895.82 → 4896.26] Okay.
[4896.40 → 4896.68] Okay.
[4896.68 → 4898.30] Let's talk about something good about Canada.
[4898.42 → 4904.02] I think the port man is the longest, um, like suspension bridge, like, like free.
[4904.10 → 4908.32] It's like the longest freestanding suspension bridge or something like that in, in something.
[4908.42 → 4910.98] I don't know if it's like in North, maybe it's only in Canada.
[4911.60 → 4916.76] Um, longest, uh, suspension something.
[4917.02 → 4917.20] Yeah.
[4917.30 → 4918.60] I'm pretty sure this is a thing.
[4919.08 → 4923.64] The port man bridge, the, uh, one of the longest in the world was constructed using the balanced
[4923.64 → 4924.62] cantilever method.
[4924.62 → 4924.96] Okay.
[4925.00 → 4926.16] One of the longest in the world.
[4926.26 → 4927.36] Well, all right, never mind.
[4928.76 → 4934.24] But it's two kilometres long, which in real units that anyone cares about is 1.26.
[4934.24 → 4938.26] Uh, okay.
[4938.34 → 4939.62] What are we talking about?
[4940.52 → 4944.12] Canada is just a road and a handful of bridges in a trench coat.
[4945.04 → 4945.82] Kind of.
[4945.92 → 4946.10] Yeah.
[4947.62 → 4948.10] No!
[4948.38 → 4949.30] No, we're real!
[4949.60 → 4949.94] I always-
[4949.94 → 4950.36] I swear!
[4950.68 → 4952.64] I was always confused by the South Park joke.
[4952.76 → 4957.20] And then I was reading the news however many years ago when one of those bridges did go
[4957.20 → 4960.36] down, and they were talking about how Canada was temporarily split in half.
[4960.40 → 4961.06] And I was like, wait.
[4961.28 → 4964.04] And I looked on a map, and I was like, whoa.
[4964.04 → 4964.40] Okay.
[4964.52 → 4966.94] It literally comes down to one road.
[4967.18 → 4972.28] In my preteens leading up to, you know, thinking about that I would become a driver at some
[4972.28 → 4978.10] point, I asked my mom, uh, to explain to me, because I hear the terms thrown around a lot,
[4978.22 → 4982.08] to explain to me the difference between a highway and another road.
[4982.20 → 4991.52] And the reason for that is that one of the major arteries that, um, we would travel on
[4991.52 → 4994.10] regularly one Lockheed Highway.
[4994.42 → 4994.90] Uh.
[4995.42 → 5000.86] At the part of Lockheed Highway where we would turn off into, like, our neighbourhood, like,
[5000.90 → 5002.18] our residential region.
[5002.72 → 5003.18] Um.
[5003.18 → 5003.26] Um.
[5004.46 → 5007.20] At that part, it had traffic lights.
[5008.00 → 5008.30] Um.
[5008.30 → 5009.60] It was only two lanes.
[5009.60 → 5010.00] Um.
[5010.00 → 5011.44] Not two and two.
[5011.44 → 5012.42] Like, two lanes.
[5012.52 → 5013.30] One each way.
[5013.30 → 5013.66] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5013.76 → 5015.36] With not even a shoulder.
[5016.06 → 5021.06] Like, I don't mean, I don't mean, you know, no fancy, fancy paved shoulder.
[5021.50 → 5021.92] Uh.
[5021.96 → 5024.40] No, you know, um, sidewalk.
[5024.72 → 5028.30] I mean, it actually didn't have a shoulder.
[5028.64 → 5034.18] Not only that, but the left turn that we had to make into our neighbourhood wasn't even traffic
[5034.18 → 5036.88] light controlled and there wasn't a left turning lane.
[5036.88 → 5042.72] Like, you would just stop in the middle of this supposed highway to perform a left turn.
[5042.90 → 5046.58] And the worst part is that that was very rarely a problem.
[5047.96 → 5051.76] I grew up in Ruskin, okay?
[5054.42 → 5055.02] Cool.
[5055.84 → 5056.38] Um.
[5057.62 → 5058.68] What are we talking about?
[5058.68 → 5065.58] YouTube finally relaxes their overly restrictive profanity policy.
[5065.82 → 5066.00] Sort of.
[5066.32 → 5070.22] So does that mean I can say words like f*** and f***?
[5071.04 → 5071.52] Yeah, so.
[5071.64 → 5072.10] I think so.
[5072.20 → 5073.98] The sort of is that it's relaxed.
[5074.12 → 5075.08] It's not gone.
[5075.24 → 5078.46] I think some people interpreted this as like, oh, we can just do whatever we want now.
[5078.52 → 5080.64] It's like, no, it's not gone.
[5080.76 → 5081.34] Do go on.
[5081.34 → 5082.50] We're just chilling out a little bit.
[5083.02 → 5088.32] James has a note here that on Thursday, we had a short circuit video receive limited monetization
[5088.32 → 5092.86] because the host said penis lamp at the 23-second mark.
[5093.24 → 5093.98] Penis lamp?
[5095.46 → 5095.98] Really?
[5096.38 → 5096.62] Yeah.
[5096.82 → 5097.22] Okay.
[5097.50 → 5097.72] Yeah.
[5099.38 → 5101.46] Are you going to elaborate on this?
[5101.56 → 5101.70] Nope.
[5101.80 → 5103.36] No one gets any topic information at all.
[5103.56 → 5103.82] Never mind.
[5104.24 → 5104.76] Recap.
[5104.92 → 5109.62] In November, YouTube changed its advertiser friendly guidelines to be far harsher to obscene
[5109.62 → 5109.98] language.
[5110.08 → 5111.14] We talked about that on the WAN show.
[5111.14 → 5112.34] Among other things.
[5112.46 → 5115.72] Communication was poor and the language of the new guidelines was vague.
[5115.72 → 5120.30] The changes applied retroactively, which is the most brutal part.
[5120.46 → 5121.18] Super cool.
[5121.36 → 5125.78] Resulting in previously acceptable content being demonetized without creators knowing
[5125.78 → 5126.24] why.
[5126.98 → 5133.14] Now, after a few months of soul-searching, YouTube has announced a new set of software
[5133.14 → 5133.16] profanity guidelines.
[5133.16 → 5134.42] Does Google have a soul?
[5134.80 → 5135.10] Okay.
[5135.10 → 5135.94] Sorry.
[5136.18 → 5136.96] I don't know about that.
[5137.24 → 5141.62] Their language is still somewhat vague, and it does not address all creator complaints,
[5141.62 → 5146.26] but there are now clearer examples of what is and isn't acceptable.
[5146.44 → 5148.10] Examples are always great in these situations.
[5148.50 → 5155.56] Videos containing moderate profanity like asshole or douchebag or occasional strong profanity like
[5155.56 → 5161.80] outside the first seven seconds of a video are eligible for full monetization.
[5161.98 → 5164.46] Oh, so I didn't even have to bleep that, but I felt like it anyway.
[5164.86 → 5169.36] Videos containing strong profanity in the first seven seconds or throughout the majority
[5169.36 → 5176.70] of the video like are eligible for limited monetization rather than no monetization.
[5176.72 → 5178.38] I don't know if holding it works, Luke, but okay.
[5178.70 → 5179.30] Does it not?
[5179.42 → 5179.96] I'm not sure.
[5180.02 → 5180.28] It should.
[5180.38 → 5181.28] It's just a tone, right?
[5183.40 → 5183.76] Dan?
[5183.76 → 5185.00] Yes, it works.
[5185.22 → 5185.40] Hey.
[5185.40 → 5186.64] You hold it for as long as you want.
[5186.74 → 5187.18] Okay, cool.
[5187.28 → 5187.70] Yeah, thought so.
[5187.82 → 5188.32] It's just a tone.
[5189.58 → 5195.58] Videos demonetized after November's changes will apparently be re-reviewed in the coming
[5195.58 → 5195.94] weeks.
[5196.50 → 5196.88] Interesting.
[5197.12 → 5201.20] So stay tuned and maybe your livelihood something?
[5202.22 → 5202.84] Yeah, maybe.
[5203.20 → 5207.56] According to YouTube, November's changes wound up being far harsher than they had actually
[5207.56 → 5208.16] intended.
[5208.66 → 5209.62] There's a discussion question.
[5209.62 → 5213.74] YouTube has to balance its relationship with advertisers and its relationship with creators.
[5213.76 → 5215.74] Is it striking the right balance?
[5215.86 → 5218.32] Is it enough to fix this oversteps after the fact?
[5219.16 → 5223.96] I think the biggest problem is that it was retroactive, and it wasn't clear enough.
[5224.04 → 5227.24] Yeah, so as long as they're communicating clearly, and they're not going back through
[5227.24 → 5233.98] your catalogue, I think that the longer YouTube exists, the more they're going to have to reckon
[5233.98 → 5238.98] with the fact that some of the content on their platform was...
[5239.50 → 5239.80] Major edge lord.
[5239.80 → 5240.66] And this isn't an excuse.
[5240.86 → 5242.20] There was an edge lord era on YouTube.
[5242.34 → 5244.00] But it was from a different time.
[5244.06 → 5244.24] Yeah.
[5244.24 → 5248.06] And so whether that means that...
[5249.32 → 5257.98] Yeah, I don't know the best way to deal with that because I can see how an advertiser with
[5257.98 → 5264.00] modern sensibilities might look at that old content that some people are still totally
[5264.00 → 5268.22] watching and go, actually, no, that's not really what I signed up for.
[5268.22 → 5272.66] I mean, it's been kind of eye-opening.
[5273.42 → 5281.46] I've just sort of randomly here and there picked up episodes of old shows that I hadn't
[5281.46 → 5283.52] watched in a long time from like the early 2000s.
[5283.62 → 5291.74] And just the casual sort of gay humour, casual use of the hard R.
[5292.64 → 5293.22] Oh, really?
[5293.28 → 5293.82] It's jarring.
[5294.38 → 5295.78] Yeah, it's jarring now.
[5296.70 → 5297.94] Casual use of hard R.
[5298.06 → 5298.30] Yeah.
[5299.30 → 5300.24] Yeah, absolutely.
[5300.54 → 5302.70] Like, okay, it was an episode of American Dad.
[5303.52 → 5303.78] Really?
[5304.02 → 5305.22] Yeah, it wasn't for shock value.
[5305.34 → 5307.50] It was just like used.
[5307.86 → 5308.00] Whoa.
[5308.12 → 5309.96] Well, I mean, here's the thing, right?
[5310.74 → 5313.88] That was in 2003 or something, like 2002.
[5314.36 → 5314.50] Yeah.
[5314.74 → 5320.16] Like, I'm not going to deny that I dropped my fair share of hard R's back then because
[5320.16 → 5320.64] we didn't even...
[5320.64 → 5322.26] The term hard R didn't even exist.
[5322.26 → 5322.98] Hmm.
[5323.86 → 5325.08] We didn't think about it.
[5325.36 → 5325.80] Right?
[5326.06 → 5331.48] And it's funny because to me, that doesn't feel like that long ago.
[5331.74 → 5334.08] But to my kids...
[5334.08 → 5335.46] Are you talking like N-word hard R?
[5335.80 → 5336.08] What?
[5336.22 → 5336.50] No.
[5336.90 → 5337.26] Okay.
[5337.44 → 5339.02] I'm pretty sure that's how people use that term.
[5339.22 → 5339.54] No.
[5340.06 → 5340.78] I think so.
[5340.82 → 5341.28] That's the N-word.
[5341.28 → 5344.28] What are you guys talking about?
[5346.04 → 5347.04] Am I mistaken?
[5347.30 → 5348.08] I think so.
[5349.86 → 5350.26] No.
[5350.36 → 5352.34] The one with the...
[5352.34 → 5354.56] Like, for mental disability.
[5355.08 → 5359.10] I'm pretty sure people use hard R in a very different way than you just used it.
[5360.68 → 5361.08] Oh.
[5362.32 → 5362.72] Okay.
[5362.84 → 5363.26] Either way.
[5363.26 → 5365.24] Hard R means ending the N-word with a hard R.
[5365.24 → 5366.94] I understand what you mean.
[5367.00 → 5367.96] No, I'm not talking about that.
[5368.96 → 5369.20] Okay.
[5369.20 → 5369.52] Cool.
[5369.76 → 5371.48] So, I'm glad that we have cleared that up.
[5371.48 → 5372.40] I'm freaking Neo over here, dude.
[5372.54 → 5373.62] We're dodging bullets.
[5373.78 → 5373.98] Yeah.
[5373.98 → 5374.62] That was bad.
[5375.40 → 5375.76] Okay.
[5375.88 → 5376.16] Yes.
[5377.26 → 5378.08] All right.
[5379.04 → 5379.92] Thank you for that.
[5384.22 → 5384.58] Right.
[5384.80 → 5387.50] I forgot about the part where I said, yeah, I just like used a cat.
[5387.56 → 5387.74] Yeah.
[5387.80 → 5388.16] No.
[5388.34 → 5388.98] Uh, actually.
[5390.26 → 5390.96] That's what I was like.
[5391.02 → 5393.10] I was pretty surprised with American Dad.
[5393.10 → 5394.46] And then you were like, yeah, me too.
[5394.54 → 5395.40] I was like, whoa.
[5396.16 → 5396.52] Okay.
[5396.62 → 5396.86] All right.
[5396.86 → 5398.20] You've known me a long time.
[5398.22 → 5398.46] Yeah.
[5398.46 → 5399.38] That's what, yeah.
[5399.44 → 5400.78] And, yeah.
[5400.90 → 5401.54] Never been a problem.
[5401.74 → 5402.12] No.
[5402.40 → 5402.64] Yeah.
[5402.94 → 5403.42] Anywho.
[5405.92 → 5406.88] We can breathe.
[5407.04 → 5407.68] Everything's okay.
[5407.80 → 5408.14] Cool.
[5408.38 → 5408.68] All right.
[5408.68 → 5411.84] So, I hope everyone likes not having a job anymore on Monday.
[5412.44 → 5415.06] Because apparently I'm a giant racist.
[5415.06 → 5417.74] We didn't lose our money in the bank crash.
[5417.90 → 5418.06] Yeah.
[5418.22 → 5418.40] No.
[5419.40 → 5420.94] In the audience run.
[5423.94 → 5424.44] All right.
[5424.44 → 5424.76] We're good.
[5425.42 → 5425.86] Okay.
[5426.98 → 5427.58] We're good.
[5428.16 → 5429.00] So, anywho.
[5429.72 → 5436.74] The point is that to, like, to my kids, 2002, 2003 is a long time ago.
[5436.74 → 5436.92] Oh, yeah.
[5437.26 → 5440.26] It's kind of like, you know, 10 years before I was born.
[5440.98 → 5444.20] 1976 is a long time ago to me.
[5444.48 → 5445.94] It's all relative.
[5446.20 → 5447.90] I think it's like, yeah, peace and love.
[5447.98 → 5448.26] Hippies.
[5448.26 → 5454.10] Like, that's a world that I never coexisted with.
[5454.60 → 5454.78] Right?
[5454.96 → 5460.14] And so, it was interesting to me how jarring it was.
[5460.20 → 5465.64] Even though, like I said, to me, people casually using the R word then.
[5465.68 → 5466.24] Is that better?
[5466.74 → 5467.44] I think so.
[5467.54 → 5467.84] Okay.
[5468.00 → 5471.60] Casually using the R word was, yeah, it was surprising.
[5471.60 → 5471.68] Interesting.
[5472.72 → 5473.02] Um.
[5474.90 → 5475.54] All right.
[5477.20 → 5477.64] So.
[5479.10 → 5480.76] Why don't we do a couple merch messages?
[5484.84 → 5485.24] Okay.
[5487.24 → 5489.20] That sounds like a good idea to me.
[5490.78 → 5491.18] Okay.
[5491.50 → 5492.78] This is from Romeo.
[5493.46 → 5496.92] Would you guys consider a hot dog or a burger a form of sandwich?
[5497.22 → 5499.02] Or would they be their own food category?
[5499.02 → 5502.66] No, I hate it when, I hate it when McDonald's calls their burgers sandwiches.
[5502.98 → 5505.12] A, because they're burgers.
[5505.12 → 5513.64] And B, because I think that sandwich has a connotation associated with it that whatever the thing is, is actual food.
[5515.16 → 5519.22] And I strongly disagree that anything McDonald's sells is food.
[5519.50 → 5520.02] Heck yeah.
[5521.60 → 5521.82] Okay.
[5521.88 → 5522.36] You want another one?
[5522.56 → 5524.28] These conversations make me uncomfortable.
[5524.44 → 5526.04] It's like when people ask if cereal is soup.
[5526.32 → 5527.80] Like, I don't, I don't even, I don't.
[5528.40 → 5528.84] No.
[5529.34 → 5529.84] I don't want to.
[5529.96 → 5530.78] Cereal is cereal.
[5531.20 → 5533.76] You would never eat soup dry, but you can eat cereal dry.
[5533.96 → 5534.76] That's the distinction.
[5535.34 → 5537.98] Never had like a packet of ramen without cooking it?
[5538.08 → 5538.64] Oh, crap.
[5539.02 → 5539.38] Ha ha.
[5539.58 → 5540.72] See, this is why I just don't.
[5540.72 → 5542.42] I don't even want to have the conversation.
[5543.72 → 5544.66] I don't want to know.
[5545.08 → 5546.20] I want to live in ignorance.
[5548.70 → 5550.10] It's just food categories.
[5550.20 → 5551.26] It's not going to affect my life.
[5551.26 → 5555.84] I don't like, you can't improve my life by convincing me that cereal is soup.
[5556.76 → 5558.98] I'm just better off where I am.
[5560.82 → 5561.18] Sorry.
[5561.38 → 5562.92] Yeah, this is awful because, yeah.
[5562.98 → 5563.42] See what I mean?
[5563.42 → 5564.00] Granola bar?
[5564.00 → 5566.12] It's a milk base, but so is a cream of broccoli soup.
[5566.98 → 5567.58] Granola bar.
[5567.82 → 5568.74] Ah, granola bar.
[5568.82 → 5573.12] If you were to take cream of broccoli soup and like freeze dry it into a bar.
[5574.72 → 5577.18] What if you freeze it into a popsicle type thing?
[5577.18 → 5577.66] Yeah, exactly.
[5578.16 → 5579.68] Okay, this is making me uncomfortable.
[5579.76 → 5579.96] See?
[5579.96 → 5580.38] Let's move on.
[5580.48 → 5580.68] See?
[5580.86 → 5581.12] Yeah.
[5581.54 → 5582.44] I don't like it.
[5582.82 → 5584.36] Next one's up from Jacob.
[5584.84 → 5585.60] Happy Friday, guys.
[5585.70 → 5590.04] I'm an IT engineer that is often disappointed by mature technologies or protocols.
[5590.34 → 5593.46] What consumer or enterprise tech disappoints you most?
[5593.92 → 5597.42] Example, Bluetooth, printers, AV, SMB, et cetera.
[5597.68 → 5599.34] Oh, I mean, well, you nailed it on printers.
[5599.60 → 5600.46] Printers is just too easy.
[5600.62 → 5602.64] Yeah, that's a super low-hanging fruit.
[5602.82 → 5603.00] Yeah.
[5603.00 → 5608.54] Man, I feel like this is the sort of thing that I rant about all the time.
[5608.88 → 5613.42] I would say voice recognition is a huge disappointment for me.
[5613.48 → 5616.56] Not because it's terrible compared to what we started with,
[5616.56 → 5620.40] but because the promises were so much better than what we ended up with.
[5620.48 → 5623.72] It took me four attempts to call my wife the other night.
[5624.44 → 5626.34] I said, call Yvonne Ho Mobile.
[5626.64 → 5630.34] And the first time, it got Yvonne Home Mobile,
[5630.34 → 5633.00] which I don't have a home number listed for her,
[5633.10 → 5636.50] so I don't know why it would think Yvonne anything home anything,
[5636.50 → 5637.92] because there is no home number.
[5638.02 → 5640.02] So it was just like, I'm sorry, who do you want to reach?
[5640.30 → 5642.34] And then I said, Yvonne Ho Mobile.
[5642.52 → 5644.68] And it goes, Yvonne How Mobile.
[5644.94 → 5647.12] I don't have a Yvonne How in my address book.
[5647.22 → 5650.54] So I try again, Yvonne Ho Mobile.
[5650.54 → 5654.56] And it goes, oh man, this is the thing that makes me most angry.
[5655.16 → 5661.18] You know how it'll do like, it'll kind of try to transcribe it to text as you're talking?
[5661.56 → 5662.30] So it got it.
[5662.56 → 5663.50] Yvonne Ho Mobile.
[5663.62 → 5664.98] And then it changed it.
[5665.14 → 5666.08] Like, no!
[5667.46 → 5669.76] You were so close!
[5669.76 → 5678.04] You had a perfect match for something on my physical storage of my device!
[5678.60 → 5680.22] And you undid it!
[5680.52 → 5682.24] Yeah, that annoys me.
[5682.50 → 5684.06] I'm going to pick mine as Windows.
[5684.58 → 5685.02] Really?
[5685.26 → 5686.94] And this is actually kind of why.
[5687.58 → 5688.98] Because, like, I actually...
[5688.98 → 5690.88] And I know a bunch of people might disagree with me,
[5690.90 → 5691.94] and I don't really care about that part,
[5692.16 → 5695.42] but I actually quite like the design aspect of Windows 11.
[5695.60 → 5696.44] I like how it looks.
[5696.44 → 5700.60] I even have been won over by the taskbar thing being in the middle.
[5701.74 → 5702.10] Yeah.
[5702.30 → 5702.52] No.
[5702.68 → 5702.88] No.
[5702.98 → 5703.88] You're objectively wrong.
[5703.98 → 5704.84] I'm okay with that.
[5704.94 → 5705.12] No.
[5705.12 → 5706.98] Because there's an option to move it, so I don't care.
[5707.10 → 5707.66] Oh, sure.
[5707.82 → 5708.06] Fine.
[5708.16 → 5710.54] But, like, leaving it in the middle is objectively wrong.
[5710.66 → 5710.84] Sure.
[5710.96 → 5712.46] But you can put it to the side if you want,
[5712.54 → 5713.24] so it doesn't really matter.
[5713.38 → 5713.56] Right?
[5713.96 → 5714.34] Sure.
[5714.34 → 5717.50] But the search has been completely bastardized.
[5718.04 → 5719.66] The search just, like, doesn't work.
[5719.76 → 5722.22] Yeah, it's amazing how bad the search is since Windows 10.
[5722.32 → 5723.64] That should not be possible.
[5723.82 → 5724.34] It shouldn't.
[5724.88 → 5725.76] It's remarkable.
[5725.76 → 5726.28] It's crazy.
[5726.84 → 5727.86] Absolutely crazy.
[5728.22 → 5731.62] The search is, like, the main thing Windows is, like,
[5731.76 → 5734.62] almost four in a user experience way at this point,
[5734.74 → 5735.88] and it's garbage.
[5736.36 → 5737.30] Like, that's...
[5737.30 → 5738.22] You mean the start menu?
[5738.34 → 5738.98] Not the same...
[5738.98 → 5741.58] Yeah, you said Windows, but the start menu is...
[5741.58 → 5743.00] No, I mean Windows in general,
[5743.14 → 5744.98] and I'll get into more points in a second.
[5744.98 → 5745.26] Oh, all right.
[5745.32 → 5746.12] Okay, all right.
[5746.12 → 5748.34] So the start menu is atrocious,
[5748.66 → 5752.70] and most users aren't going into things like control panel these days and stuff,
[5752.76 → 5753.64] to be completely honest.
[5753.68 → 5754.42] Most users are not.
[5754.42 → 5755.18] Yeah, that's fair.
[5755.18 → 5758.68] So most user interaction with Windows at this point is just the start menu,
[5758.82 → 5760.30] and the start menu is rough.
[5760.40 → 5760.76] Or the desktop.
[5761.70 → 5762.04] Yeah, fair enough.
[5762.04 → 5766.36] I know a lot of people who just fart everything onto the desktop.
[5766.36 → 5766.82] The computer is the desktop on the start menu.
[5766.92 → 5767.44] Yeah, fair enough.
[5768.04 → 5771.98] The other reason why I'm frustrated is there are certain things that, like,
[5772.24 → 5777.34] I feel like Windows should be doing at this point that it's not.
[5778.28 → 5779.30] And one of those was, like,
[5779.30 → 5781.06] I was talking to my brother about this the other day,
[5781.30 → 5783.86] because he needed to send me or send someone or me.
[5783.94 → 5785.10] I don't know what the situation was,
[5785.16 → 5786.76] but a file transfer needed to happen.
[5787.00 → 5787.10] Yeah.
[5787.74 → 5788.52] I get it.
[5789.48 → 5790.84] How's there no share menu?
[5790.84 → 5794.18] Like, you have on Android and iOS and macOS, basically everything else.
[5794.26 → 5794.34] Yeah.
[5794.48 → 5796.10] How is there no built-in screen recording?
[5796.20 → 5796.68] I don't know.
[5796.68 → 5800.30] And, like, at this point in time, I should be able to have,
[5800.66 → 5803.18] and it shouldn't have to go through OneDrive, okay?
[5803.50 → 5804.92] It should be able to tunnel directly.
[5805.10 → 5806.48] I should be able to have a family group.
[5807.40 → 5810.22] And if my brother wants to share me some big file,
[5810.46 → 5814.18] it should be able to set up an encrypted thing between us and handle it.
[5814.30 → 5816.72] You, I think I want to revise my answer,
[5817.16 → 5820.80] because file sharing has got to be it for me.
[5820.92 → 5821.26] Yeah.
[5821.54 → 5823.90] And, like, how Windows hasn't taken care of that.
[5823.90 → 5826.88] How is it that I am sitting here next to you,
[5827.46 → 5833.52] and we cannot transfer at line speed over a simple A to A USB cable,
[5833.70 → 5838.28] or at full Wi-Fi speed over the hotspot we are both connected to,
[5838.42 → 5844.78] without going through some onerous, tedious, handshaking authentication system.
[5844.78 → 5845.06] Yep.
[5845.06 → 5846.76] It's like, no, it's fine.
[5846.82 → 5847.48] It's that guy.
[5847.56 → 5848.16] It's okay.
[5848.82 → 5849.76] Just chill.
[5850.20 → 5852.14] Or the fact that my phone is sitting here,
[5852.18 → 5855.12] and it's not as simple as just, like, beep, book, and it's on.
[5855.34 → 5857.04] And now there are ways to do that.
[5857.26 → 5861.20] Like, for example, there's actually pretty good file browsing apps
[5861.20 → 5865.20] where you can just dump files into SMB shares on Android,
[5865.46 → 5867.92] and on iOS, for that matter, which is more impressive to me.
[5868.18 → 5871.04] But it all needs to be premeditated.
[5871.54 → 5876.50] I can't just spontaneously be sitting in a coffee shop next to someone that I'm meeting
[5876.50 → 5880.66] and go, here, let me just drag and drop this file over to you.
[5881.46 → 5885.22] That is, if Windows 12 doesn't have that,
[5885.40 → 5886.54] I'm going to be sitting there going,
[5886.70 → 5888.58] what the f*** have they actually been working on?
[5888.58 → 5892.10] Because this is, like, I understand there have been improvements, okay?
[5892.30 → 5893.82] So don't just hold on.
[5894.68 → 5896.86] But what out of the user experience,
[5898.42 → 5899.84] not user experience,
[5900.16 → 5902.50] in the way that you use Windows,
[5902.90 → 5906.02] what has really changed that much since, like, Vista?
[5906.56 → 5907.48] Almost nothing.
[5907.68 → 5907.88] Yeah.
[5908.08 → 5910.10] Vista was, Vista, underrated.
[5911.28 → 5913.10] And I don't even necessarily want to get into that.
[5913.10 → 5916.34] But, like, seriously, there have been improvements.
[5916.52 → 5917.66] Yes, there's been a bunch of improvements.
[5917.76 → 5918.56] There's the shell thing now.
[5918.62 → 5919.18] There's all this kind of stuff.
[5919.18 → 5921.36] But for the average Norrie user,
[5922.02 → 5925.96] I don't believe that their Windows experience has really been improved
[5925.96 → 5928.42] since maybe, you know,
[5928.62 → 5930.62] maybe the average computer can run it a little better now.
[5930.78 → 5931.50] Stuff like that.
[5931.60 → 5931.74] Yeah.
[5931.86 → 5935.02] But, like, that's not really on them.
[5935.12 → 5936.58] And search was better in Vista.
[5936.72 → 5937.28] Search was better.
[5937.28 → 5939.90] It had some innovations that have actually gone away.
[5940.14 → 5944.48] Like the games' folder that would organize all your games for you.
[5945.06 → 5945.98] Like, that was pretty cool.
[5946.08 → 5949.04] Now every piece of software that has to do with gaming
[5949.04 → 5950.52] has decided they're going to do it.
[5950.66 → 5950.76] Yeah.
[5950.76 → 5953.70] So I have 87 different game managers on my computer
[5953.70 → 5957.12] because every graphics thing is like,
[5957.18 → 5959.08] oh, you can launch our games through us
[5959.08 → 5960.54] as if anyone's going to do that.
[5960.60 → 5963.10] And then also Steam and then also everything else.
[5963.20 → 5964.28] It's like, oh, my God.
[5964.28 → 5966.28] It's just there's...
[5966.28 → 5971.82] The fact that the games for Windows Live is so terrible
[5971.82 → 5973.32] is really frustrating.
[5973.96 → 5975.58] Like, games for Windows Live,
[5975.98 → 5978.32] imagine an actually perfect version
[5978.32 → 5981.72] of, like, the PC, Xbox app or games for Windows Live.
[5982.14 → 5983.58] I know because it's always been bad.
[5983.88 → 5986.70] Because games for Windows Live was basically just the worst possible DRM.
[5986.84 → 5988.96] But imagine you were, like, the PM of that.
[5989.80 → 5990.68] And you could drive the direction.
[5990.68 → 5991.46] That could have made it awesome.
[5991.64 → 5992.70] Yeah, it could be sick.
[5992.70 → 5992.88] Maybe.
[5993.16 → 5995.56] Because you have to get the games' industry to cooperate with you.
[5995.70 → 5996.54] So that's tough.
[5996.84 → 6000.20] If there's a more fragmented industry,
[6000.90 → 6002.60] I haven't seen it.
[6002.60 → 6005.48] But it has potential that has been squandered.
[6005.72 → 6006.32] That's true.
[6006.62 → 6007.10] That's fair.
[6007.20 → 6009.72] And, like, there's so much you could do with Windows
[6009.72 → 6011.90] to just make it an awesome experience.
[6013.36 → 6014.90] And it's just...
[6014.90 → 6016.38] SteveJ3D says,
[6016.38 → 6018.28] I'm hearing 30-day Vista challenge.
[6018.82 → 6019.34] Oh, God.
[6019.38 → 6021.46] No, that would actually be very risky
[6021.46 → 6023.64] for people like us because of security.
[6023.86 → 6024.02] Yeah.
[6024.24 → 6024.38] Yeah.
[6024.70 → 6025.38] We'd be...
[6025.92 → 6027.70] We might get harpooned.
[6029.22 → 6032.54] But, like, really, I'm thinking back to, like, okay,
[6032.76 → 6033.86] from XP to Vista,
[6034.18 → 6037.22] yeah, there were some changes in, like, how I use the computer.
[6038.22 → 6039.68] But at this point, like,
[6041.08 → 6044.22] my OS upgrades have been for compatibility reasons only.
[6045.10 → 6045.26] Yeah.
[6045.90 → 6050.10] I have genuinely not wanted a new OS since 7.
[6050.62 → 6050.98] Yeah.
[6052.52 → 6053.32] Like, at all.
[6053.42 → 6055.14] And I look back at screenshots of XP,
[6055.38 → 6056.40] and I feel nostalgic.
[6056.94 → 6058.82] And I, like, like the aesthetic and stuff.
[6058.92 → 6060.20] I look back at screenshots of 7,
[6060.26 → 6061.20] and I'm like, oh, yeah.
[6061.92 → 6063.56] I can just use that now, and it'll be completely fine.
[6063.84 → 6064.06] Yeah.
[6064.22 → 6066.16] Like, I don't know.
[6066.16 → 6067.76] It's very...
[6067.76 → 6069.10] It's been disappointing to me.
[6069.90 → 6070.84] I think that's fair.
[6071.82 → 6072.06] Yeah.
[6073.92 → 6075.20] Plus, no drivers for Vista.
[6075.32 → 6077.32] Yeah, but, like, those are the reasons why people are upgrading.
[6077.64 → 6080.04] Compatibility, drivers, security, stuff like that.
[6080.08 → 6081.24] It's not like, oh, wow,
[6081.38 → 6083.34] there's this new feature in the new one
[6083.34 → 6084.64] that is really compelling.
[6084.96 → 6087.76] I can now, just because it's my brother,
[6087.88 → 6090.44] and I'm in the Microsoft family group or whatever,
[6090.66 → 6092.90] I can just send him whatever file I want
[6092.90 → 6093.66] from wherever in the world.
[6093.90 → 6095.30] Microsoft's going to find a way to tunnel us.
[6095.30 → 6096.84] We don't have to pay for some extra service.
[6096.98 → 6098.00] It should be fine.
[6099.26 → 6100.58] But that's just not possible.
[6101.50 → 6102.82] Search is just worked.
[6103.24 → 6105.58] So, like, I can't find local files
[6105.58 → 6107.54] because it's constantly just binging things.
[6108.04 → 6109.40] It's just like, oh, my goodness.
[6109.50 → 6111.30] Like, it's so rough.
[6111.98 → 6112.74] I don't know.
[6112.74 → 6117.62] Like, it's even worse than the voice thing you were describing
[6117.62 → 6120.90] where it's like, it's trying to interpret voice
[6120.90 → 6123.20] and it gets it right and then corrects it to wrong,
[6123.30 → 6125.30] which is terrible and dumb.
[6125.52 → 6127.94] I literally typed this in.
[6128.52 → 6128.82] Yeah.
[6129.48 → 6130.76] And it is just like, nope.
[6130.76 → 6133.68] You left no room for misinterpretation.
[6133.68 → 6137.40] And it still is like, nah, there are some local files,
[6137.48 → 6138.38] but I'm not going to bring them up.
[6138.44 → 6139.08] I'm just going to Bing it.
[6139.30 → 6140.74] Like, stop.
[6141.88 → 6142.82] I thought you liked Bing.
[6144.10 → 6146.20] Wow, that's super cool, Giancarlo Carr.
[6146.84 → 6148.92] Basically, charity raising thing.
[6148.96 → 6149.32] That's awesome.
[6149.58 → 6150.02] Oh, that's sweet.
[6150.12 → 6150.24] Yeah.
[6150.24 → 6153.96] I don't want to get into LLMs because, honestly,
[6154.02 → 6156.56] until GPT-4 comes out, it's like not that interesting.
[6156.84 → 6158.70] But Bing's been neutered super hard.
[6160.36 → 6164.28] Let's talk about a new product on LTT Store,
[6164.54 → 6166.76] but not the one that we're actually launching this week.
[6167.78 → 6173.24] We are planning a collab with the original makers of the Mod MAT.
[6173.82 → 6174.50] Mod Rite.
[6174.76 → 6174.98] Oh.
[6175.42 → 6175.80] Yeah.
[6175.80 → 6180.44] We have reached an agreement in principle to move forward,
[6180.88 → 6187.34] licensing their trademarks and patents to create a Mod MAT product.
[6187.68 → 6191.08] But right now, we're in the very, very early stages.
[6191.22 → 6196.28] We obviously have some ideas of what we want to make it the best possible Mod MAT
[6196.28 → 6196.82] on the market.
[6199.24 → 6203.02] Obviously, the place to start for us was collaborating with the creators
[6203.02 → 6203.66] of the original.
[6203.66 → 6206.84] But there are some things that we want to add.
[6206.96 → 6210.92] So I don't know how many of these are going to make it from my wish list
[6210.92 → 6212.72] into an actual physical product.
[6213.18 → 6216.24] But some of the ideas that we've had are heat-resistant.
[6216.48 → 6217.54] Dan, I was thinking of you.
[6218.04 → 6218.86] Heat resistance.
[6219.16 → 6222.40] So if anyone were to accidentally leave a soldering iron or a hot glue gun
[6222.40 → 6223.66] or something like that on one.
[6223.82 → 6224.42] Did he do this?
[6224.60 → 6225.20] No, no.
[6225.32 → 6225.74] Oh, okay.
[6225.82 → 6227.42] I just think of Dan sometimes.
[6227.66 → 6228.58] I got to go back to HQ2.
[6228.70 → 6228.92] Hold on.
[6229.00 → 6229.28] Yeah, yeah.
[6229.28 → 6233.56] So if someone were to leave a hot item on it, it shouldn't burn through.
[6233.56 → 6234.78] Somebody's already typed me.
[6235.00 → 6236.04] Matty Mc Matt face.
[6237.92 → 6238.32] No.
[6238.70 → 6239.00] No.
[6239.00 → 6246.04] I'd love to have some kind of embedded screw management.
[6246.72 → 6248.48] Like embedded magnets.
[6248.48 → 6256.06] You could kind of just stick iron-containing screws or ferrous screws
[6256.06 → 6256.88] or whatever else.
[6256.88 → 6258.24] A little screw sorting area built into the mat.
[6258.24 → 6260.98] Onto like a little spot, or maybe it could be an attachment.
[6261.20 → 6261.46] I don't know.
[6261.52 → 6262.56] There are lots of different ideas.
[6263.46 → 6267.64] One idea we have already that I'd really like to move forward with is right now,
[6268.14 → 6273.38] like whether you pick up one from Line or even the original Mod Mat or anything like that,
[6273.50 → 6278.08] the way that you attach an anti-static strap to it is with that awful like button interface.
[6278.52 → 6280.50] I know it's industry standard or whatever.
[6280.72 → 6280.98] It's like that.
[6280.98 → 6281.38] It is.
[6281.42 → 6281.88] That's fine.
[6282.38 → 6283.82] But what if you could make it modular?
[6283.82 → 6288.78] So what if you had a really strong magnetic interface that you can stick the button thing on
[6288.78 → 6293.18] so that every time you attach your strap, it just sticks onto there?
[6293.78 → 6294.14] Then.
[6294.30 → 6295.82] You could theoretically use it for something else.
[6296.00 → 6298.46] Then you could have different pieces.
[6298.64 → 6301.02] So you could have a little, like a little, okay.
[6301.10 → 6303.96] Like, you know, like those little wrist strap things.
[6304.14 → 6308.14] So they have like a, like a little bar, and then you put a thing through it, and you tie a wrist strap onto it.
[6308.52 → 6311.84] So you could just have like a little bar that you could clip an alligator clamp to.
[6311.84 → 6313.96] Because I mean, that's super annoying, right?
[6314.00 → 6317.94] When you have one of those button interface ones, and then you have a wrist strap that has an alligator clamp.
[6318.02 → 6320.76] You're like, this doesn't really, this doesn't really go on here.
[6320.88 → 6323.98] So if you could have like a modular interface for that, and it could be magnetic.
[6324.22 → 6326.10] That was one of the ideas that I had.
[6328.14 → 6328.54] Yeah.
[6328.84 → 6333.66] So anyway, the point is that there is a post in the merch section of the forum.
[6333.66 → 6346.22] So if you guys have any creative ideas for what you'd like to see in a mod mat, talk about what you look for, what you like, what you dislike, your favourite, your least favourite and why.
[6346.22 → 6353.08] And if you think there are any key features that are missing from any mod mats that are currently on the market, and we are going to try to address it.
[6353.12 → 6355.76] We want to make the best darn mod mat.
[6356.04 → 6364.98] And like I said, really, really excited to be starting from a place where we're working with like the original creators of the mod mat.
[6365.74 → 6366.78] Pretty, pretty cool.
[6367.16 → 6372.98] I actually still have my original Mod Rite mod mat on my build station at home in the basement.
[6372.98 → 6380.14] And that was, that was one of the things that sort of prompted me to finally get off my butt and ask someone else to do something for me.
[6380.34 → 6382.04] No, I was like, Nick was the one who reached out.
[6382.16 → 6384.28] You noticed like, this is a little old.
[6384.44 → 6386.28] Yeah, it's pretty old.
[6386.36 → 6387.76] And I was like, yeah, like what happened to these guys?
[6387.78 → 6388.56] Oh, they're still around.
[6388.64 → 6388.94] Okay.
[6389.30 → 6390.18] Why don't we reach out?
[6390.20 → 6391.68] Because I think that would be awesome.
[6392.68 → 6393.44] Very excited.
[6393.86 → 6395.24] Can you buy theirs anymore?
[6395.58 → 6396.66] I actually don't know.
[6396.78 → 6397.48] That's a good question.
[6397.62 → 6400.64] I don't seem to be able to on their site, but I don't know.
[6401.02 → 6402.92] They still have copyright 2013.
[6403.32 → 6404.28] Which is pretty sick.
[6406.38 → 6407.24] Oh, yeah.
[6407.60 → 6409.76] I actually mentioned this before the show.
[6410.00 → 6411.56] They're still advertising Firefox 3.
[6411.98 → 6412.38] Cool.
[6412.62 → 6413.44] Oh, there you go.
[6413.52 → 6414.66] Yeah, I recognize that for sure.
[6415.80 → 6416.78] Ah, look at this.
[6416.82 → 6417.26] Hey.
[6417.86 → 6418.48] My unboxing.
[6419.48 → 6421.16] This video must still be around.
[6421.48 → 6421.92] Wow.
[6422.56 → 6423.40] That's awesome.
[6423.78 → 6425.38] Mod Rite mod mat unboxing video.
[6425.38 → 6429.26] Just casual nine-year-old video.
[6429.88 → 6431.88] June 13th, 2013.
[6432.16 → 6433.70] Almost 10 years old.
[6435.96 → 6436.36] Nice.
[6437.50 → 6437.90] Nice.
[6438.90 → 6439.30] Wow.
[6439.86 → 6440.56] That's awesome.
[6441.94 → 6442.32] Oh, yeah.
[6442.46 → 6443.26] No, this is the one.
[6443.88 → 6445.18] Or wait, is this the one I have at home?
[6445.28 → 6445.70] I'm not sure.
[6445.74 → 6446.38] It might be the bigger one.
[6447.14 → 6448.14] Oh, no.
[6448.22 → 6450.22] It wasn't seeing it at home that prompted me.
[6450.28 → 6451.62] It was seeing the one on Dan's desk.
[6451.62 → 6454.28] So I have one of these.
[6454.38 → 6456.26] And then, Dan, you have one of these on your desk too, right?
[6456.38 → 6456.72] That's right.
[6456.80 → 6458.12] Yeah, I do all my electronics on it.
[6458.76 → 6460.32] It came with my desk.
[6460.44 → 6461.00] This one, right?
[6461.24 → 6462.00] That's the one, yeah.
[6462.10 → 6462.24] Yeah.
[6462.32 → 6463.46] That might be the one I'm still using.
[6463.46 → 6464.60] I've seen that around a few times.
[6464.60 → 6465.16] Oh, my God.
[6465.20 → 6466.82] I'm having my own star-struck moment.
[6467.10 → 6468.98] I get to use Linus's mod mat.
[6469.04 → 6469.32] Oh, my God.
[6470.28 → 6471.32] Just relax, okay?
[6472.18 → 6476.28] But, yes, that is the actual one from that video nine years ago.
[6476.58 → 6478.24] Still going strong nine years later, right?
[6478.24 → 6479.42] It's literally perfect.
[6479.98 → 6482.40] I would not have guessed that it's been in use for nine years.
[6482.48 → 6482.88] It's amazing.
[6483.28 → 6485.10] Yeah, so we're going for it.
[6485.18 → 6485.78] We're going for it.
[6485.84 → 6487.04] I'm really excited.
[6487.18 → 6488.58] I think we've got the right starting point.
[6488.58 → 6494.66] I think we've got kind of some perfect ideas to evolve what is sitting at my build
[6494.66 → 6496.12] station and what's on your desk.
[6497.14 → 6497.98] That's going to be good.
[6498.48 → 6501.12] Okay, we will finally talk about the product we're launching this week.
[6501.22 → 6506.62] I didn't let Luke touch it, but this is one that has been in the works for,
[6506.62 → 6509.18] good gravy.
[6509.98 → 6514.10] I'm pretty sure we started this before Bridget joined.
[6514.54 → 6515.20] Whoa, okay.
[6515.38 → 6516.64] Wait, no, is that quite right?
[6516.72 → 6521.38] No, no, it must have been very early in her tenure, so it's been well over a year in development.
[6521.38 → 6531.72] So we completely missed an entire spring, winter, fall cycle of availability that we had targeted,
[6531.98 → 6538.54] and we are now through the fall and winter and getting dangerously close to the spring
[6538.54 → 6540.82] of the next target for it.
[6540.82 → 6545.42] But we wanted to take the time to get it right, and it's finally here.
[6545.52 → 6546.72] It's the 3D Down jacket.
[6548.30 → 6549.36] Do I go now?
[6549.52 → 6550.06] We did a...
[6550.06 → 6550.84] Oh, is that...
[6550.84 → 6551.32] Wait, which one?
[6551.48 → 6551.92] That's yours.
[6552.10 → 6552.46] That's yours.
[6552.74 → 6553.56] Oh, no, this isn't mine.
[6553.62 → 6554.24] This is the small.
[6554.38 → 6555.18] I have mine in my backpack.
[6555.42 → 6555.50] Oh.
[6556.52 → 6556.86] Yeah, I know.
[6556.86 → 6558.86] Okay, so yeah, you get to play with it now.
[6558.86 → 6562.96] So what's really cool about this thing is the material.
[6563.92 → 6564.48] Sometimes...
[6564.48 → 6565.20] It feels nice.
[6565.32 → 6571.36] Sometimes you start the product development process with a garment you're trying to create.
[6571.60 → 6573.94] The shirt that Luke is wearing, for example.
[6574.12 → 6577.92] We set out to create a t-shirt that was really comfortable and blah, blah, blah, etc.
[6578.88 → 6583.08] And we sought a material to make it out of.
[6584.00 → 6584.96] They can't see any of that.
[6585.72 → 6587.54] Actually, Dan, do you want to man the camera?
[6587.54 → 6589.60] Hold on, let me redo it.
[6590.04 → 6595.28] With the 3D Down jacket, we found this really cool material.
[6595.90 → 6598.60] It's not quite down.
[6598.94 → 6600.70] It's not quite 3D printed.
[6601.28 → 6604.34] But there is a down layer out of the...
[6604.34 → 6606.40] I believe it's 11 layers on the jacket.
[6606.88 → 6607.70] Let me double-check.
[6608.68 → 6611.16] This is 3D printed down fabric features.
[6611.30 → 6615.40] Stain resistant, breathable, four-way stretch, lightweight, heat retention, wind resistant, water-resistant.
[6615.40 → 6616.40] It's not...
[6616.40 → 6616.88] Okay.
[6617.00 → 6621.20] It's not 3D printed in the same way that you would imagine like a plastic part.
[6621.70 → 6624.40] But it is an additive process...
[6625.56 → 6626.24] Did I just...
[6626.24 → 6626.48] Oh.
[6626.78 → 6627.20] Hello, Dan.
[6628.64 → 6630.42] I was like, is this a video of how it's made?
[6630.50 → 6630.68] Wow.
[6630.68 → 6637.34] But it is laid down with an additive process that deposits the fibres rather than weaving them.
[6637.84 → 6645.18] So what that allows you to do is it allows you to have this kind of cobweb pattern that puts room between them for better breathability.
[6645.18 → 6649.92] And it also makes the insulation absolutely fantastic for the thickness.
[6650.54 → 6651.54] So yeah, check it out.
[6652.54 → 6654.92] The outer shell is a blend of nylon and spandex.
[6654.92 → 6656.12] I'm assuming this is PKK.
[6656.50 → 6657.32] So, of course.
[6657.32 → 6657.76] Yeah.
[6657.96 → 6660.04] PKK zipper water-resistant?
[6660.28 → 6660.48] Yep.
[6661.58 → 6662.30] Of course.
[6664.60 → 6666.46] All the seams are taped.
[6667.00 → 6671.28] I believe it's 18,000 millimetres of water resistance.
[6671.42 → 6675.86] We never call anything waterproof, water resistance, internal pockets.
[6676.32 → 6683.74] But what's really special about it is the 3D down or a 3D printed down or whatever you kind of want to call it.
[6683.74 → 6685.36] There is a down component to it.
[6685.72 → 6691.16] But the interior material, because it's super insulated, it's really comfy.
[6691.58 → 6703.82] So if you're the kind of person like me and like, I assume, Luke, who would just be in a t-shirt even in fairly adverse weather but might want a jacket when he goes outside, it's really, really nice on the skin.
[6703.82 → 6707.38] And we spent a lot of time on getting the fit just right.
[6707.50 → 6709.34] There is a little bit of stretch in the outer shell, though.
[6710.18 → 6711.84] It's breathable with good wind resistance.
[6712.02 → 6714.20] It's reasonably water-resistant.
[6714.66 → 6715.16] It's lightweight.
[6715.82 → 6718.48] I just absolutely love this thing.
[6718.64 → 6719.32] It looks really sharp.
[6719.42 → 6721.26] Where's, is there any branding on it?
[6721.52 → 6722.28] Just a little bit.
[6722.28 → 6722.70] I haven't seen any.
[6722.70 → 6727.32] On the very bottom right, I think, of the bottom there.
[6727.50 → 6729.42] Yeah, if you stand up, maybe we'll be able to see it.
[6730.20 → 6732.92] Oh, and he waxed the thing.
[6733.26 → 6735.84] There's a little, can you see it?
[6736.54 → 6738.88] There's like little dots that make a little LTT.
[6739.18 → 6741.26] We're going for really subtle branding on this.
[6741.34 → 6742.96] We wanted it to just look really clean.
[6744.28 → 6745.42] I'm trying to show it out.
[6745.46 → 6745.94] It's a little hard.
[6746.00 → 6746.88] Yeah, don't worry about it.
[6747.00 → 6747.70] It's fine.
[6747.70 → 6753.28] The point is that it's, yeah, it's light.
[6753.40 → 6753.78] It's comfy.
[6753.92 → 6755.88] It's super, super warm for the weight.
[6757.08 → 6758.34] And the hood is big enough.
[6758.82 → 6760.70] That was something that we actually really struggled with.
[6760.78 → 6760.96] Yeah.
[6762.70 → 6763.98] I like huge hoods.
[6764.08 → 6764.38] They're good.
[6764.44 → 6767.10] Because if you wanted to wear like a toque or something under it, you actually can.
[6767.18 → 6770.40] But there are two things that, okay, again, this took a while.
[6771.74 → 6776.30] You can adjust the hood such that, and the way that it pulls on it, it doesn't have to be huge.
[6776.30 → 6778.54] And then there are adjustments around the bottom as well.
[6779.06 → 6781.30] Another thing that took us kind of forever.
[6782.12 → 6783.60] Yeah, there's another one on the other side.
[6784.04 → 6787.48] Another thing that took us forever to get right is the adhesive on the sleeves.
[6787.86 → 6790.74] So the sleeves err a little bit on the long side,
[6790.80 → 6794.48] because we've gotten perfect feedback from people about long sleeves.
[6795.86 → 6799.80] But obviously, if you want them to stay in place, you're going to have adjuster things.
[6800.16 → 6802.30] Okay, but hold that up to the mic while you rip it off.
[6804.94 → 6806.18] It's really strong.
[6806.30 → 6806.56] Yeah.
[6806.96 → 6810.90] It will not come off, and it's not like your typical hook-and-loop fastener,
[6810.94 → 6811.78] if you look at it closely.
[6812.60 → 6817.84] It's like a really cool one that really definitely super does not come apart.
[6818.10 → 6818.32] Funky.
[6818.60 → 6818.88] Yeah.
[6819.22 → 6823.50] This is a nice, almost rubbery, soft-touch textile to it, too.
[6823.80 → 6823.98] Yep.
[6823.98 → 6824.22] Texture.
[6824.22 → 6829.90] I am so, so happy with this thing.
[6830.60 → 6831.24] This is really nice.
[6831.50 → 6832.92] It's really expensive.
[6833.10 → 6833.52] Thanks, Dan.
[6834.22 → 6836.28] It's a $250 jacket.
[6836.94 → 6842.58] Like, our cost is pretty high, because these materials are...
[6842.58 → 6843.86] Feels too nice to not be.
[6843.96 → 6844.72] ...really expensive.
[6844.72 → 6846.72] But, like...
[6846.72 → 6847.72] But, like...
[6847.72 → 6850.02] Yeah.
[6850.26 → 6851.28] It is what it is.
[6854.78 → 6855.42] People...
[6855.42 → 6857.32] You know, it's a hilarious thing.
[6857.46 → 6860.88] Whenever we talk about pricing for stuff, there are two camps.
[6861.50 → 6862.82] There's the...
[6862.82 → 6865.74] Oh, my God, I would never spend more than $30 on a jacket camp.
[6866.12 → 6867.26] And then there's the...
[6867.26 → 6867.82] Which is fine.
[6867.96 → 6868.86] That seems cheap.
[6868.90 → 6871.96] I would never spend less than $600 on a jacket camp.
[6872.20 → 6873.90] Which is also fine, I guess.
[6874.10 → 6874.82] And then...
[6875.60 → 6878.28] There's shockingly little middle ground.
[6878.28 → 6880.56] It's a fascinating...
[6880.56 → 6887.64] It's a fascinating thing, seeing everyone's different perception of value.
[6890.48 → 6890.92] Yeah.
[6891.06 → 6891.46] I don't know.
[6891.52 → 6892.80] It's an interesting observation.
[6892.82 → 6893.82] Um...
[6893.82 → 6895.00] WB something?
[6895.14 → 6895.62] Anyway, whatever.
[6895.80 → 6896.52] In Twitch chat says,
[6896.60 → 6899.02] $250 without apparent branding is weird.
[6899.42 → 6901.64] I feel like people who shop on LTT want it to be known.
[6901.90 → 6903.66] We want it to stand without the brand.
[6904.22 → 6904.42] Yeah.
[6904.42 → 6906.64] That's a big part of what we're...
[6906.64 → 6908.84] I was happy that there was subtle branding.
[6909.04 → 6909.22] Yeah.
[6909.34 → 6909.82] Like, I...
[6910.52 → 6910.74] Yeah.
[6910.90 → 6911.88] I like that, personally.
[6914.14 → 6915.84] So, I'm looking for...
[6915.84 → 6918.76] I've seen a lot of people picking them up in the merch messages today.
[6918.76 → 6921.34] And I'm looking forward to seeing people's feedback on the store.
[6921.34 → 6924.20] If you're not convinced, don't believe me.
[6924.48 → 6925.92] Believe what people post on the store.
[6926.02 → 6930.00] I mean, our reviews are basically always excellent.
[6930.16 → 6931.66] I really like the feel of the materials.
[6931.86 → 6933.10] I'm really confident in this one.
[6933.36 → 6933.60] Yeah.
[6933.60 → 6933.64] Yeah.
[6934.28 → 6935.16] This one's a killer.
[6935.80 → 6936.00] Yeah.
[6936.20 → 6937.56] It's taken long enough.
[6939.68 → 6941.10] I want LTT branding low-key.
[6941.24 → 6941.84] I get that.
[6941.90 → 6943.00] I could see people wanting it.
[6943.10 → 6943.92] I just...
[6943.92 → 6944.26] I...
[6944.26 → 6946.34] So, I am someone who went to a lot of...
[6946.34 → 6947.26] A lot of shows.
[6947.34 → 6948.32] I went to a lot of conventions.
[6948.56 → 6954.28] And my clothing for many, many years was effectively comprised of convention clothes.
[6954.28 → 6954.62] Gaming companies.
[6954.88 → 6955.10] Yeah.
[6955.32 → 6955.94] Tech companies.
[6955.94 → 6957.26] Yeah.
[6957.44 → 6959.72] And now it's comprised of LTT store merch.
[6959.82 → 6960.00] Yeah.
[6962.00 → 6965.64] And it's kind of nice to have some nice things.
[6965.74 → 6967.16] Like, this is a very nice jacket.
[6967.22 → 6968.26] It's not a cheap jacket.
[6968.92 → 6971.54] I'm kind of happy that it isn't covered in branding.
[6972.74 → 6972.96] Right?
[6973.04 → 6975.96] Like, you could wear this out to somewhere very nice.
[6976.04 → 6976.42] Yeah, of course.
[6976.66 → 6977.94] And it would look really sharp.
[6978.14 → 6979.06] Because it's really sharp.
[6979.06 → 6984.94] The thing is that, like, stuff is designed a lot of the time for, like, I need to wear it.
[6985.16 → 6985.28] Yeah.
[6985.90 → 6986.46] Yeah.
[6986.94 → 6988.60] And I don't want to be...
[6988.60 → 6990.62] Like, you guys got to think about this, right?
[6990.86 → 6998.12] On Saturday, I don't want to be a billboard for LTT, actually.
[6998.44 → 7003.20] I don't want to get approached because people recognize the merch.
[7003.22 → 7003.98] The logo, yeah.
[7004.24 → 7004.72] Necessarily.
[7004.82 → 7005.04] Yeah.
[7005.24 → 7008.38] So, when we were putting together, like, an outerwear item,
[7008.38 → 7012.90] I'm kind of sitting here going, once in a while, like, I'm into it.
[7012.92 → 7014.50] I'll wear my swacked out or whatever.
[7015.44 → 7021.26] But if it's raining and miserable, and I'm cranky, I just want a black jacket.
[7022.48 → 7023.40] Don't talk to me.
[7024.28 → 7025.16] To be clear, it's fine.
[7025.20 → 7026.10] It's fine to talk to me.
[7026.14 → 7027.02] I'm super down.
[7027.10 → 7028.48] I just mean, I don't want to be...
[7028.48 → 7029.88] I don't want it to be so loud.
[7030.18 → 7032.68] It's also kind of better, like, at least in my opinion,
[7032.68 → 7035.20] if someone just recognizes you as you instead of being like,
[7035.20 → 7039.42] I have seen that logo on the internet, you must be the guy, you know?
[7039.66 → 7040.22] I don't know.
[7041.68 → 7042.72] Not to me, at least.
[7042.94 → 7043.32] All right.
[7043.52 → 7044.94] Let's move on.
[7045.04 → 7045.64] Next topic.
[7046.12 → 7047.48] Secret shopper update.
[7048.52 → 7052.18] No details on the date, but obviously, at some point,
[7052.38 → 7055.38] we will be working on another round of Secret Shopper,
[7055.42 → 7056.78] or maybe we're already working on it.
[7057.14 → 7057.70] Who knows?
[7057.70 → 7063.96] But during the last round, the company that wound up well behind the pack was Dell Alienware.
[7065.46 → 7068.82] After promising up and down, after the first Secret Shopper,
[7068.96 → 7071.48] that they had completely overhauled their customer service standards,
[7071.90 → 7075.16] their terrible, pushy customer service got us an overpriced,
[7075.34 → 7079.04] underperforming gaming computer that earned them dead last.
[7079.80 → 7082.24] Dell is once again asking you to...
[7082.24 → 7082.40] Sorry.
[7082.70 → 7085.10] Dell is once again promising that they've changed.
[7085.16 → 7086.38] They've really changed this time.
[7086.38 → 7090.66] And they have instated extensive diagnostics and quality control measures
[7090.66 → 7093.02] to find gaps in their customer service.
[7093.56 → 7096.46] They also claim that they have dialled back sales incentives
[7096.46 → 7099.44] and increased focus on customer satisfaction scores,
[7099.64 → 7104.46] which was a key criticism that we made about the incentives for their sales team at the time.
[7105.00 → 7109.28] There is no word on whether they've increased base salary for reps,
[7109.32 → 7110.64] which we also brought up,
[7110.98 → 7115.22] and is a key part of what makes those commission incentives so tantalizing,
[7115.22 → 7118.94] because as far as I could tell, these people were desperate,
[7119.74 → 7126.44] absolutely desperate to sell these warranties and on-site services and financing,
[7126.70 → 7129.56] because clearly there was...
[7129.56 → 7130.24] I don't know.
[7130.50 → 7133.20] Sometimes you get a vibe sometimes, right?
[7133.20 → 7136.56] where it's like, this is not just training.
[7136.88 → 7138.42] This is survival.
[7138.92 → 7139.16] Yeah.
[7139.24 → 7140.42] Was how I felt about it.
[7140.48 → 7140.64] Yeah.
[7141.94 → 7144.44] So I told Dell,
[7144.88 → 7148.04] all right, I'll pass this along,
[7148.48 → 7151.58] but I'm not your PR department.
[7151.98 → 7154.58] I'm not a mouthpiece for you guys.
[7154.58 → 7157.64] I am passing this along for only one reason.
[7158.00 → 7167.08] The reason I'm passing it along is so that now you guys and us and Dell are all on the same page
[7167.08 → 7169.18] that it should be perfect.
[7170.00 → 7172.82] So when Secret Shopper happens or happened,
[7172.82 → 7180.28] I really hope that we do not find the same things that we did last time.
[7180.52 → 7180.76] Yeah.
[7181.84 → 7184.22] Because unprompted, okay,
[7184.24 → 7186.34] this is an email that landed in my inbox.
[7186.82 → 7187.50] Hold on a second.
[7187.80 → 7189.88] Let me just check something real quick here,
[7190.16 → 7194.38] because I think it was pretty much out of the blue,
[7194.76 → 7197.12] like out of absolutely nowhere.
[7197.12 → 7203.42] Here we go.
[7204.60 → 7204.90] Okay.
[7204.98 → 7207.66] So my first outreach about this was in 2020.
[7209.12 → 7213.20] So I heard from my Dell contact who put me in touch with
[7213.20 → 7218.04] Director of Communications for Client Solutions Group,
[7218.16 → 7219.66] something, something, something, something.
[7219.90 → 7220.16] Okay.
[7220.54 → 7225.00] And I basically went, yeah, you know, good luck with that.
[7225.72 → 7226.06] Okay.
[7226.06 → 7231.98] I didn't hear anything for over a year since December 2020.
[7232.20 → 7236.50] And then I randomly got an email from this person on January the 6th.
[7236.50 → 7239.20] And then I just have put off dealing with it until then.
[7241.06 → 7243.00] But it's like this long thing.
[7243.06 → 7244.50] Oh, that's pretty much like,
[7244.54 → 7247.92] here's all the ways that we're fixing everything.
[7247.92 → 7248.92] And so I'm sitting here going,
[7249.06 → 7252.22] if you are completely unprompted, essentially,
[7252.42 → 7255.60] going to send me this list of ways that you're doing way better,
[7255.60 → 7257.30] something might've changed.
[7257.48 → 7261.08] I expect it to darn well be better when it comes time to have a look at it.
[7261.26 → 7261.42] Yeah.
[7264.94 → 7266.04] So good luck with that.
[7266.86 → 7268.18] That time might not be now.
[7268.26 → 7269.08] We still can't tell you.
[7269.56 → 7270.88] What else do you want to talk about?
[7271.30 → 7272.30] Still got some good stuff here.
[7272.40 → 7273.06] I'm kind of scrolling through right now.
[7273.16 → 7274.84] We did all the main topics.
[7274.94 → 7275.44] It looks like.
[7275.44 → 7276.98] Farewell to the Fairphone 2.
[7278.12 → 7278.48] See ya.
[7278.68 → 7278.96] Yeah.
[7279.18 → 7281.64] It'll have its last security update this month.
[7282.14 → 7283.16] Seven years.
[7283.30 → 7283.62] Wow.
[7283.96 → 7285.02] After it first launched,
[7285.22 → 7288.24] they only promised three to five years of updates back in 2015.
[7288.60 → 7291.76] And they will apparently continue to sell parts while supplies last.
[7291.98 → 7294.00] If you wish to continue using a Fairphone 2,
[7294.00 → 7296.62] you'll have the option of installing a custom ROM like LineageOS
[7296.62 → 7300.98] or trading it in for a 50 euro voucher for Fairphone's e-store.
[7301.58 → 7303.52] So the discussion question here is,
[7303.60 → 7306.84] it's clearly possible to make a profit with a modular, long-lasting phone.
[7307.28 → 7309.60] What would happen if a major manufacturer took the lead
[7309.60 → 7311.74] with a genuinely sustainable, high-powered phone?
[7312.66 → 7315.22] Well, hell would freeze over, I guess,
[7315.30 → 7317.22] because the direction the industry has been going
[7317.22 → 7318.96] has been the complete opposite of that.
[7318.96 → 7319.44] Not that.
[7321.20 → 7322.44] And I don't know.
[7322.50 → 7323.86] Their investors would probably be mad
[7323.86 → 7327.10] because I don't think you can make as much money.
[7327.20 → 7328.74] I mean, that's the problem.
[7329.72 → 7330.28] Right?
[7330.64 → 7331.08] Always.
[7331.08 → 7332.68] I think we've proven with LTT Store
[7332.68 → 7336.60] that you can make money
[7336.60 → 7340.46] and not be super toxic about it.
[7341.78 → 7344.92] But can you make enough to satisfy investors?
[7344.92 → 7349.10] Because it's not enough to be profitable.
[7349.36 → 7350.84] I mean, we've talked about this a ton.
[7351.04 → 7353.92] You have to be more profitable than the other guys.
[7353.94 → 7356.18] And more profitable than last year.
[7356.36 → 7356.50] Yeah.
[7356.94 → 7358.56] It's just...
[7358.56 → 7360.08] In a finite world,
[7360.46 → 7361.60] how can you...
[7361.60 → 7364.28] How can you expect infinite growth?
[7364.28 → 7369.72] And, like, a lot of...
[7369.72 → 7371.78] A lot of different places,
[7371.92 → 7373.30] even if they can't have growth,
[7373.44 → 7375.36] it doesn't mean they're not successful.
[7375.82 → 7376.22] Yeah.
[7376.46 → 7378.58] Their current amount of profit
[7378.58 → 7380.16] might be very healthy
[7380.16 → 7382.22] and they might have saturated the market
[7382.22 → 7383.42] and that's fine.
[7384.42 → 7385.70] And they can keep doing better
[7385.70 → 7386.46] and they keep innovating
[7386.46 → 7387.98] to keep that profit level where it is
[7387.98 → 7388.78] and that's not a bad thing.
[7389.16 → 7391.08] But places just only go on growth.
[7391.98 → 7392.16] Yeah.
[7392.24 → 7392.72] People are talking about,
[7392.72 → 7394.78] yeah, it's never enough to satisfy investors.
[7394.94 → 7395.68] Yeah, 100%.
[7395.68 → 7396.32] Exactly.
[7397.40 → 7398.58] Speaking of investors,
[7398.90 → 7401.16] Asa tech says they are optimistic
[7401.16 → 7403.74] despite rough financial seas.
[7404.08 → 7404.86] So Asa tech,
[7405.04 → 7407.22] you might not know of them
[7407.22 → 7408.86] because they don't have much
[7408.86 → 7410.66] of a consumer-facing brand anymore,
[7410.66 → 7413.90] but they are best known for their LCLC
[7413.90 → 7416.48] or low-cost liquid cooling solutions,
[7416.88 → 7418.54] the likes of which that you would have seen
[7418.54 → 7421.58] over the years resold by companies like...
[7421.58 → 7423.36] Corsair or...
[7423.36 → 7424.50] I mean, Corsair, I think,
[7424.58 → 7425.62] is really the biggest partner,
[7425.76 → 7427.12] but also system integrators.
[7428.36 → 7430.52] They had a pretty weak last year
[7430.52 → 7431.76] and they have now reported
[7431.76 → 7433.80] a 47% drop in revenue
[7433.80 → 7435.20] in the fourth quarter of 2022
[7435.20 → 7436.56] compared to 2021.
[7436.76 → 7437.60] The tech sector
[7437.60 → 7440.40] is taking an absolute pounding.
[7441.22 → 7443.16] Like, I mean that in every sense.
[7443.30 → 7443.54] Yeah.
[7444.10 → 7445.02] It's bad.
[7445.10 → 7446.92] You see, Intel's last results
[7446.92 → 7448.66] are like they lost like $700 million
[7448.66 → 7449.96] or something like that.
[7450.02 → 7450.44] Like, I'm just...
[7450.44 → 7451.66] I'm looking at this going,
[7451.82 → 7452.66] holy shrikes,
[7452.82 → 7454.68] are these guys going to survive?
[7454.74 → 7455.28] Oh, yeah, they are.
[7455.30 → 7456.12] They're just going to lay everyone off.
[7456.16 → 7456.54] Okay, cool.
[7456.62 → 7457.30] So that's great.
[7457.44 → 7458.00] But anyway,
[7458.22 → 7460.46] they reported a 47% drop in revenue
[7460.46 → 7461.96] in the fourth quarter of 2022
[7461.96 → 7463.02] compared to 2021.
[7463.44 → 7465.22] I remember thinking about this
[7465.22 → 7467.34] when the pandemic boom happened.
[7467.94 → 7469.78] And all those computer sales happened.
[7469.88 → 7470.32] And I was like,
[7470.90 → 7471.68] okay.
[7472.10 → 7472.48] Yeah.
[7472.48 → 7474.96] You guys are riding high on this
[7474.96 → 7475.98] and you're super excited.
[7476.42 → 7477.62] But here's the thing.
[7478.10 → 7480.14] There's a finite number of computers
[7480.14 → 7480.98] that I need.
[7481.16 → 7481.50] Yeah.
[7481.78 → 7482.94] And I feel like
[7482.94 → 7484.84] it's a lot more
[7484.84 → 7486.40] than what most people need.
[7488.10 → 7490.48] Like, I'm obviously kidding.
[7490.58 → 7491.40] I have a lot of computers.
[7491.68 → 7493.24] And partially due to
[7493.24 → 7494.30] the conversation we had earlier
[7494.30 → 7494.94] about Windows,
[7495.26 → 7496.92] but also due to a lot of other reasons,
[7497.24 → 7498.90] there isn't a huge reason
[7498.90 → 7500.44] to upgrade that quickly these days.
[7500.44 → 7502.20] The upgrade cycle has,
[7502.52 → 7503.74] from what I can see,
[7503.90 → 7505.06] gotten longer.
[7505.56 → 7507.46] And so if you guys are selling
[7507.46 → 7509.32] twice as many computers today,
[7510.32 → 7512.28] there's going to be a reckoning.
[7512.42 → 7513.38] Sorry, I got to throw this out there.
[7514.08 → 7516.26] Jonathan in Flow plane chat saying
[7516.26 → 7517.90] the tech sector is getting
[7517.90 → 7519.54] straight up LTT bagged
[7519.54 → 7522.24] is hilarious and very topical.
[7522.40 → 7522.96] Thank you for that.
[7524.56 → 7527.24] So the reckoning is here.
[7527.24 → 7529.84] People just don't need
[7529.84 → 7530.68] a new computer.
[7531.08 → 7531.18] Yeah.
[7531.64 → 7533.72] I really do think it's
[7533.72 → 7535.44] partly economic uncertainty,
[7535.44 → 7537.18] but also partly
[7537.18 → 7539.16] people just straight up
[7539.16 → 7541.84] not needing a new computer.
[7542.08 → 7543.54] And when there's economic uncertainty,
[7543.82 → 7545.48] wants somewhat go out the window,
[7545.74 → 7545.98] right?
[7546.64 → 7547.14] So like,
[7547.56 → 7548.32] even if you're like,
[7548.36 → 7549.20] oh, I could run this game
[7549.20 → 7550.14] slightly faster.
[7551.06 → 7552.38] Most games are really easy
[7552.38 → 7553.40] to run these days anyway,
[7553.58 → 7554.46] to be completely honest.
[7554.62 → 7555.26] But yeah.
[7555.26 → 7556.86] They reported an overall
[7556.86 → 7559.86] operating loss of $5.4 million,
[7560.48 → 7562.12] in part due to property,
[7562.32 → 7562.62] equipment,
[7562.76 → 7563.76] and development investments
[7563.76 → 7565.28] of $22.2 million.
[7565.72 → 7566.52] This drop is likely
[7566.52 → 7568.00] due to the same market contractions
[7568.00 → 7568.58] that have been affecting
[7568.58 → 7569.90] other computer parts manufacturers.
[7570.42 → 7571.18] In the same quarter,
[7571.26 → 7571.88] they announced their
[7571.88 → 7573.28] eighth gen coolers and sales
[7573.28 → 7574.02] are currently trending
[7574.02 → 7575.04] slowly upwards.
[7575.26 → 7576.08] So they believe the market
[7576.08 → 7576.74] is stabilizing,
[7576.86 → 7577.70] that they have the financial health
[7577.70 → 7578.44] to maintain operations
[7578.44 → 7579.48] until conditions improve.
[7579.92 → 7580.24] Anyway,
[7580.38 → 7581.46] the main reason for this
[7581.46 → 7582.36] is not that I think you guys
[7582.36 → 7583.72] particularly care about Asa tech,
[7583.72 → 7584.56] but it was just an excuse
[7584.56 → 7585.36] to talk about
[7585.36 → 7588.68] how that boom and bust
[7588.68 → 7591.06] has definitely happened.
[7591.22 → 7591.50] And it's,
[7591.56 → 7592.10] yeah,
[7592.14 → 7592.76] it's kind of scary
[7592.76 → 7593.72] because there's definitely
[7593.72 → 7594.90] going to be some smaller players
[7594.90 → 7595.62] that are struggling
[7595.62 → 7597.34] more than the Intel's
[7597.34 → 7598.24] and AMD's
[7598.24 → 7599.36] and Microsoft's of the world.
[7600.00 → 7601.00] Speaking of struggling,
[7601.46 → 7602.24] have you ever struggled
[7602.24 → 7603.94] to get your printer to work
[7603.94 → 7605.14] after you installed
[7605.14 → 7606.30] third-party ink
[7606.30 → 7608.26] because HP was all like,
[7608.38 → 7608.92] f*** you,
[7609.38 → 7611.14] and pushed a firmware
[7611.14 → 7612.40] that prevented the use
[7612.40 → 7613.18] of ink cartridges
[7613.18 → 7614.78] without HP chips in them?
[7615.50 → 7615.90] This,
[7616.40 → 7617.60] this sucks.
[7617.78 → 7618.08] Oh yeah.
[7618.28 → 7619.50] This sucks so much.
[7619.60 → 7619.84] Oh yeah.
[7620.36 → 7623.62] I love my old Samsung laser printer.
[7623.84 → 7625.84] I have like an ML 2010
[7625.84 → 7626.90] or something like that,
[7626.96 → 7627.26] 2020,
[7627.46 → 7628.02] I can't remember.
[7628.14 → 7628.44] It was like,
[7628.74 → 7629.84] it has a sticker on it
[7629.84 → 7630.32] that's like,
[7630.40 → 7631.34] world's most compact
[7631.34 → 7632.30] colour laser printer.
[7632.40 → 7633.88] So whichever one that is.
[7633.88 → 7636.38] And when Samsung sold
[7636.38 → 7638.00] their printer business to HP,
[7638.34 → 7639.54] I didn't really think about it
[7639.54 → 7640.16] at the time.
[7640.74 → 7641.68] Did they update it?
[7641.78 → 7643.12] But the only way
[7643.12 → 7644.58] that HP could extract
[7644.58 → 7645.60] a ton of value from that,
[7645.68 → 7646.72] aside from just eliminating
[7646.72 → 7647.40] a competitor,
[7647.92 → 7649.78] had to be to engage
[7649.78 → 7651.14] in these kinds of toxic
[7651.14 → 7652.58] anti-consumer practices.
[7652.80 → 7653.06] Oh yeah.
[7653.44 → 7657.60] HP is essentially making it
[7657.60 → 7659.34] so your printer won't work
[7659.34 → 7661.36] if you have ink in it
[7661.36 → 7662.26] that doesn't have
[7662.26 → 7664.66] an HP chip in it.
[7665.16 → 7665.88] They've engaged
[7665.88 → 7666.74] in similar behaviour
[7666.74 → 7667.52] for years
[7667.52 → 7668.62] using the rationale.
[7668.92 → 7669.54] And this is a joke.
[7669.62 → 7670.76] I remember back at NCI,
[7671.02 → 7672.20] I had to sit through
[7672.20 → 7673.52] a presentation like this
[7673.52 → 7674.52] from an HP rep,
[7675.24 → 7676.14] like explaining
[7676.14 → 7677.94] the consumer benefits
[7677.94 → 7679.92] of first party ink.
[7679.96 → 7680.78] And I'm sitting here going,
[7681.70 → 7682.76] you know,
[7682.82 → 7684.26] I have like whole jars
[7684.26 → 7685.10] of ink at home
[7685.10 → 7685.98] and I'm going to keep
[7685.98 → 7686.60] using them
[7686.60 → 7687.62] with my little syringes,
[7687.68 → 7687.82] right?
[7688.46 → 7689.62] And they're talking about
[7689.62 → 7690.58] like the technology
[7690.58 → 7691.84] of the NATO droplets
[7691.84 → 7692.30] or whatever.
[7692.42 → 7692.62] I'm like,
[7692.68 → 7693.04] yeah, sure.
[7693.08 → 7694.22] If I was a professional
[7694.22 → 7694.96] printing house,
[7694.96 → 7695.60] by all means,
[7695.72 → 7697.46] but I just need to hand
[7697.46 → 7699.14] in my stupid report
[7699.14 → 7699.92] and I need a coloured
[7699.92 → 7701.10] bar graph on it
[7701.10 → 7701.46] or whatever.
[7701.62 → 7701.96] Like I don't,
[7702.52 → 7704.50] so they've used
[7704.50 → 7705.02] the rationale
[7705.02 → 7706.06] that they're ensuring
[7706.06 → 7707.92] the customer experience,
[7707.92 → 7709.08] but courts
[7709.08 → 7710.30] in three different countries
[7710.30 → 7711.30] have ruled against them
[7711.30 → 7712.50] in multiple class action
[7712.50 → 7713.66] lawsuits with penalties
[7713.66 → 7714.76] worth millions of dollars.
[7715.20 → 7716.36] That's the problem though.
[7716.54 → 7717.44] Millions of dollars
[7717.44 → 7718.48] is just cost
[7718.48 → 7719.24] of doing business
[7719.24 → 7719.92] to a company
[7719.92 → 7720.48] that's operating
[7720.48 → 7721.44] at HP scale.
[7721.54 → 7722.22] We've been talking
[7722.22 → 7723.60] about wimpy fines
[7723.60 → 7724.48] on the WAN show
[7724.48 → 7725.18] the whole time
[7725.18 → 7726.04] the WAN show has existed.
[7726.44 → 7727.54] I'm so tired of it.
[7728.04 → 7729.46] They need to crank these.
[7729.52 → 7730.14] It needs to actually
[7730.14 → 7731.30] hurt the companies
[7731.30 → 7733.10] when the fine
[7733.10 → 7734.56] is significantly less
[7734.56 → 7735.56] than the profit
[7735.56 → 7736.18] they're going to have
[7736.18 → 7736.94] by just continuing
[7736.94 → 7737.56] to do it.
[7737.72 → 7739.10] There's this quote
[7739.10 → 7739.98] of somebody talking
[7739.98 → 7740.92] about how
[7740.92 → 7743.36] certain things
[7743.36 → 7744.02] are just different
[7744.02 → 7744.64] for the rich
[7744.64 → 7746.36] and it's talking
[7746.36 → 7748.16] about parking downtown.
[7749.16 → 7749.92] And they're like,
[7749.98 → 7750.74] yeah, a parking ticket
[7750.74 → 7751.32] for some people
[7751.32 → 7751.92] is really brutal.
[7752.04 → 7752.58] A parking ticket
[7752.58 → 7753.28] for other people
[7753.28 → 7755.06] is just like
[7755.06 → 7756.74] how you pay
[7756.74 → 7757.52] to park your car.
[7758.10 → 7759.26] They don't actually care.
[7759.32 → 7759.86] It doesn't matter.
[7759.94 → 7760.70] It doesn't impact them.
[7760.76 → 7761.64] It's still more efficient
[7761.64 → 7762.88] for them to just park
[7762.88 → 7764.62] illegally and pay the fine
[7764.62 → 7765.88] than it is to
[7765.88 → 7767.70] go park properly.
[7767.90 → 7768.82] It's the same problem.
[7769.06 → 7770.10] Final Fantasy Tactics
[7770.10 → 7771.52] doesn't have a great
[7771.52 → 7773.00] translation in its
[7773.00 → 7774.52] original North American release,
[7774.64 → 7775.90] but this is a gem.
[7776.54 → 7777.60] Geography says,
[7777.60 → 7778.56] if the penalty
[7778.56 → 7779.18] for a crime
[7779.18 → 7779.80] is a fine,
[7780.08 → 7781.32] that law only exists
[7781.32 → 7782.24] for the lower classes.
[7782.56 → 7783.78] That's 100% true.
[7783.96 → 7784.06] Yeah.
[7784.40 → 7784.60] Yeah.
[7784.88 → 7785.16] Totally.
[7785.62 → 7787.74] And this fine,
[7788.04 → 7789.22] if it's not more
[7789.22 → 7789.94] than what they're
[7789.94 → 7791.26] benefiting from doing this,
[7791.30 → 7791.58] they're just going
[7791.58 → 7792.18] to keep doing it
[7792.18 → 7792.70] because they're still
[7792.70 → 7793.46] profiting off of it.
[7793.70 → 7794.68] It doesn't work.
[7794.86 → 7795.72] Have you still not
[7795.72 → 7797.42] played Final Fantasy Tactics?
[7797.66 → 7797.86] No.
[7798.14 → 7799.64] It is so good.
[7800.28 → 7801.72] It is so good.
[7801.80 → 7802.78] I think they released it
[7802.78 → 7803.40] on Android.
[7803.40 → 7805.64] There is no excuse, sir.
[7806.06 → 7806.78] You need to play
[7806.78 → 7807.88] Final Fantasy Tactics
[7807.88 → 7809.04] because aside from
[7809.04 → 7810.00] the stellar gameplay,
[7810.18 → 7811.20] and it really is good
[7811.20 → 7812.58] and it really does hold up,
[7812.94 → 7814.86] the story is outstanding.
[7815.62 → 7817.44] Everything is morally ambiguous
[7817.44 → 7820.06] and it's not clear
[7820.06 → 7821.32] who the good guys are
[7821.32 → 7822.42] and who the bad guys are
[7822.42 → 7824.02] and it's deep
[7824.02 → 7824.96] and it's wonderful.
[7825.96 → 7827.06] What is Waddle?
[7827.76 → 7828.20] Waddle.
[7828.30 → 7829.14] War of the Lions.
[7829.34 → 7830.24] Is it Final Fantasy Tactics
[7830.24 → 7830.78] War of the Lions?
[7830.94 → 7831.68] Well, it depends.
[7831.80 → 7832.58] So one of the releases,
[7832.80 → 7836.00] I think like the advanced release,
[7836.16 → 7836.58] I don't know.
[7836.64 → 7837.62] There are multiple releases
[7837.62 → 7838.10] of the game.
[7838.24 → 7839.08] War of the Lions, I think,
[7839.18 → 7840.26] is like a more updated
[7840.26 → 7840.88] version of it.
[7841.20 → 7841.46] Okay.
[7842.22 → 7842.50] Yeah.
[7843.92 → 7845.08] Final Fantasy Tactics,
[7845.22 → 7845.82] so good.
[7846.40 → 7847.16] So good.
[7848.62 → 7849.84] AMD drivers have been
[7849.84 → 7850.66] working computers
[7850.66 → 7851.86] with a rare bug.
[7851.86 → 7853.94] They can put computers
[7853.94 → 7854.68] into a boot loop,
[7854.78 → 7855.82] rendering them inoperable.
[7855.98 → 7856.58] AMD has acknowledged
[7856.58 → 7857.86] the problem a month
[7857.86 → 7858.92] after it was first noticed
[7858.92 → 7859.70] and has helped at least
[7859.70 → 7860.74] one computer journalist
[7860.74 → 7862.28] through a complicated workaround.
[7862.76 → 7863.80] The glitch only occurs
[7863.80 → 7864.28] when installing
[7864.28 → 7865.58] the AMD GPU driver,
[7865.72 → 7866.64] opting for a factory
[7866.64 → 7867.84] reset clean installation,
[7868.36 → 7869.78] then having the misfortune
[7869.78 → 7870.48] of having Windows
[7870.48 → 7871.18] automatically update
[7871.18 → 7871.66] in the background.
[7871.84 → 7873.16] It's always Windows update.
[7873.70 → 7874.46] Speaking of things
[7874.46 → 7875.24] that just should be
[7875.24 → 7876.10] way better by now,
[7876.38 → 7877.92] no permanent fix yet exists,
[7878.02 → 7879.14] but it can be avoided
[7879.14 → 7880.08] by updating Windows
[7880.08 → 7881.26] before performing
[7881.26 → 7882.00] any installations.
[7882.76 → 7885.40] We have some LTX Expo updates.
[7886.20 → 7887.50] Ooh, this is exciting.
[7888.32 → 7890.78] Asus DOG is our title sponsor
[7890.78 → 7892.12] for LTX 2023.
[7893.18 → 7894.10] Let's go.
[7894.28 → 7895.56] Thanks, Asus DOG.
[7896.24 → 7898.76] Also, Ubiquity is our title sponsor
[7898.76 → 7899.70] for the Whale Land.
[7899.96 → 7901.12] I knew they were going to provide
[7901.12 → 7901.98] networking equipment,
[7902.12 → 7902.88] but that's awesome.
[7903.20 → 7904.00] Since when does Ubiquity
[7904.00 → 7904.70] ever spend money?
[7905.96 → 7907.68] Well, that's a legitimate question.
[7908.10 → 7908.62] That's fair.
[7908.76 → 7909.40] It's like asking,
[7909.50 → 7910.10] when does NVIDIA
[7910.10 → 7910.84] ever spend money?
[7911.76 → 7913.26] Actually, it's not like asking that,
[7913.34 → 7914.50] because the difference is that
[7914.50 → 7916.68] Ubiquity has a philosophy
[7916.68 → 7917.84] of building products
[7917.84 → 7918.70] that sell themselves,
[7918.98 → 7920.22] and NVIDIA is just
[7920.22 → 7921.14] the cheapest
[7921.14 → 7923.06] on the entire face of the earth.
[7923.72 → 7925.06] It's a completely
[7925.06 → 7926.22] separate problem.
[7927.66 → 7929.26] And, oh, this is cool,
[7929.70 → 7930.46] Epic Games
[7930.46 → 7932.36] X PC Build Simulator 2
[7932.36 → 7932.92] sponsorship
[7932.92 → 7935.84] for the Water Cooling Workshop booth.
[7935.84 → 7936.90] We're also going to be working
[7936.90 → 7937.96] with EK Water Blocks.
[7938.04 → 7939.40] Details coming in a future update.
[7939.60 → 7941.82] I haven't seen Rod in the chat today,
[7941.92 → 7943.56] but I assume
[7943.56 → 7945.80] you guys are coming up, right?
[7945.96 → 7946.46] Got to.
[7946.70 → 7947.20] I mean,
[7947.62 → 7948.98] if Bob and Rod aren't there,
[7949.04 → 7949.84] is it really LTX?
[7950.56 → 7950.92] I don't...
[7950.92 → 7951.68] Have they missed one?
[7952.22 → 7952.88] I don't think so.
[7952.88 → 7953.52] I don't think we were at the first one.
[7953.58 → 7954.26] Were they at the first one?
[7954.60 → 7956.14] 2017 was the first one, right?
[7956.18 → 7956.88] Trying to remember.
[7957.40 → 7958.04] That was...
[7958.04 → 7958.92] The first one's like a...
[7958.92 → 7960.02] It's a blur for me.
[7961.16 → 7962.28] They weren't involved
[7962.28 → 7963.42] in running the first one.
[7963.44 → 7964.14] I know that.
[7964.60 → 7967.14] But they have hosted booths for us
[7967.14 → 7968.34] at the last couple,
[7968.44 → 7969.38] and those guys are absolute...
[7969.38 → 7970.34] They've been at the good ones.
[7970.80 → 7971.20] Chad's.
[7971.38 → 7972.30] Yeah, Rod's in there.
[7972.56 → 7972.80] Nice.
[7972.80 → 7973.38] I'll be at LTX.
[7973.70 → 7974.24] Heck yeah.
[7974.54 → 7975.62] Has anyone reached out to you
[7975.62 → 7978.08] about doing something at LTX, though?
[7978.14 → 7980.30] Because we'd love to have you...
[7980.30 → 7982.00] We'd love to have both of you there.
[7982.14 → 7984.08] I know you can't necessarily speak for Bob,
[7984.48 → 7984.76] but yeah,
[7984.76 → 7986.12] we can take this conversation offline.
[7986.58 → 7987.96] Like, literally offline.
[7988.80 → 7989.70] And we can chat.
[7989.78 → 7990.86] Yeah, this is awesome.
[7991.12 → 7992.10] Oh, they had a wall pewter
[7992.10 → 7992.72] at the first one.
[7992.90 → 7994.12] Oh, that's right!
[7994.94 → 7995.34] Cool!
[7995.68 → 7996.04] Yes!
[7996.38 → 7997.58] So they have been involved
[7997.58 → 7998.52] as exhibitors
[7998.52 → 7999.72] every single time.
[7999.72 → 8001.04] Ah, I love it.
[8001.58 → 8003.12] It wouldn't be LTX
[8003.12 → 8003.90] without Bob and Rod.
[8005.76 → 8006.72] Okay, cool.
[8006.88 → 8007.64] Looking forward to it.
[8008.34 → 8009.02] Oh, what else?
[8009.16 → 8011.52] Oh, hide image URLs on stream.
[8012.04 → 8012.52] Okay.
[8012.84 → 8013.90] Oh, this is awesome!
[8014.38 → 8015.42] We're going to have
[8015.42 → 8016.32] some special
[8016.32 → 8018.96] designer edition desk pads.
[8020.16 → 8023.20] What exactly these have to do with LTX?
[8023.56 → 8024.42] Hard to say,
[8024.78 → 8027.12] but our designers have been hard at work
[8027.12 → 8029.66] creating some of the coolest desk pads
[8029.66 → 8031.50] that you are ever going to see.
[8031.76 → 8033.76] I'm going to start with Sarah's design.
[8034.36 → 8035.12] What do you think?
[8035.48 → 8036.26] These are all...
[8036.26 → 8037.30] I've sneaked peeked all of them.
[8037.30 → 8038.24] Oh, you looked at all of them?
[8038.32 → 8039.02] Dang it, Luke!
[8039.12 → 8040.58] These are actually so sick.
[8040.60 → 8041.44] Come on, man!
[8041.54 → 8042.86] I really like the...
[8042.86 → 8045.06] Did you play Far Cry...
[8045.06 → 8047.64] Blood whatever?
[8047.72 → 8048.56] Blood whatever, yeah.
[8048.70 → 8050.40] I glanced at it.
[8050.44 → 8051.68] I didn't really play it.
[8051.68 → 8052.06] I should.
[8052.28 → 8052.82] It gives me...
[8052.82 → 8053.60] You don't have to play
[8053.60 → 8054.16] through the whole thing.
[8054.34 → 8054.66] Okay.
[8054.80 → 8056.44] Just give it an hour or two.
[8056.52 → 8056.86] It's fun,
[8056.90 → 8057.56] and then it gets old.
[8057.74 → 8059.86] But it's fun for the first bit.
[8060.42 → 8061.58] It reminds me a lot of that,
[8061.66 → 8062.66] and it's great.
[8063.04 → 8063.84] I love the colours.
[8063.96 → 8065.08] I love the pixelization.
[8065.34 → 8066.88] The prehistoric tech.
[8067.00 → 8067.10] Yeah.
[8067.10 → 8071.40] And Sarah's a big dinosaur lady,
[8071.66 → 8073.98] I think would be one way of putting it.
[8074.00 → 8074.42] Very cool.
[8074.80 → 8076.18] So that's one of them.
[8076.90 → 8079.10] The next one to show you guys
[8079.10 → 8081.08] is from Lloyd,
[8081.44 → 8084.06] who is one of our long-time designers
[8084.06 → 8086.06] that many of you will probably have...
[8087.28 → 8088.40] If you've ever bought anything
[8088.40 → 8089.42] from LTTstore.com...
[8089.42 → 8089.98] Let's say this.
[8090.20 → 8091.94] If you've bought more than one thing
[8091.94 → 8093.10] from LTTstore.com,
[8093.26 → 8094.78] there's a solid chance
[8094.78 → 8096.52] you've worn a Lloyd pen.
[8097.10 → 8097.58] Okay.
[8100.16 → 8102.90] So he did a Vancouver skyline.
[8103.00 → 8103.76] I think this is cool
[8103.76 → 8104.90] as specifically,
[8105.24 → 8106.72] potentially a memorabilia piece
[8106.72 → 8108.68] for LTX itself.
[8109.02 → 8110.56] Because we're like...
[8110.56 → 8113.30] I don't know if we're in frame here.
[8113.36 → 8113.80] We're going to be here.
[8114.06 → 8114.34] Okay.
[8114.48 → 8115.32] Yeah, that is it.
[8115.48 → 8115.62] Yeah.
[8115.62 → 8117.10] So here's the convention centre,
[8117.28 → 8120.18] and then we've got some other iconic elements
[8120.18 → 8121.32] of the Vancouver skyline.
[8121.52 → 8122.54] Super cool.
[8122.96 → 8125.18] I haven't seen this actually printed yet.
[8125.18 → 8127.24] I really hope that IRL,
[8127.54 → 8129.46] it's as vibrant and bold
[8129.46 → 8131.58] as the work that he's done here,
[8131.66 → 8132.82] but super cool.
[8133.46 → 8134.80] And then finally,
[8135.70 → 8136.92] this is,
[8137.06 → 8138.30] well,
[8138.56 → 8140.54] a new person you'll be meeting.
[8140.86 → 8141.58] Some of you,
[8141.66 → 8143.12] if you just kind of hang around
[8143.12 → 8144.26] on our corporate website,
[8144.40 → 8145.24] might know Maria,
[8145.24 → 8147.06] or you might see her in,
[8147.58 → 8148.32] you know,
[8148.40 → 8150.48] shorts or behind the scenes
[8150.48 → 8151.86] or stuff like that.
[8152.06 → 8152.80] But she,
[8153.10 → 8154.86] aside from just doing our thumbnails,
[8155.52 → 8159.60] also has some pretty strong design jobs.
[8159.80 → 8160.94] So she put together
[8160.94 → 8161.76] what she's calling
[8161.76 → 8163.24] Zero Gravity Gaming,
[8163.40 → 8164.86] which is just a really fun,
[8165.18 → 8166.62] vibrant design
[8166.62 → 8168.20] that I,
[8168.42 → 8168.74] man,
[8168.82 → 8169.62] when I saw this,
[8169.76 → 8170.70] I actually,
[8170.92 → 8172.14] they didn't tell me who did it,
[8172.14 → 8173.42] and I didn't manage to guess
[8173.42 → 8175.96] because I confess,
[8176.20 → 8177.38] I kind of thought of her
[8177.38 → 8179.34] as the thumbnail person
[8179.34 → 8181.36] and not as just like,
[8181.50 → 8181.62] well,
[8181.72 → 8182.32] because I don't think,
[8182.32 → 8182.76] as other things,
[8182.82 → 8182.88] yeah,
[8182.94 → 8183.44] I don't think,
[8183.56 → 8184.14] a lot of thumbnails make.
[8184.28 → 8184.40] Yeah,
[8184.40 → 8186.06] we didn't really hire her
[8186.06 → 8187.36] as a graphic designer.
[8187.46 → 8187.64] I mean,
[8187.68 → 8188.16] sort of,
[8188.32 → 8189.78] because thumbnails are that.
[8190.20 → 8190.78] But we didn't,
[8190.78 → 8192.30] we didn't intend to,
[8192.30 → 8192.72] to,
[8192.72 → 8194.16] to have her just like
[8194.16 → 8195.56] do general design work,
[8195.64 → 8195.86] like,
[8195.94 → 8196.82] especially not for like merch
[8196.82 → 8197.10] or whatever,
[8197.10 → 8197.82] but I think she did
[8197.82 → 8198.90] an absolutely bang up job.
[8199.00 → 8200.06] I absolutely love it.
[8200.18 → 8200.32] Yeah.
[8200.32 → 8202.00] So the only hard part
[8202.00 → 8203.44] is going to be
[8203.44 → 8204.42] figuring out
[8204.42 → 8206.02] which one to choose.
[8206.52 → 8206.94] Someone's asking,
[8207.02 → 8208.36] so are these local only?
[8208.48 → 8209.90] So you can only get these at LTX?
[8210.06 → 8210.40] I don't know.
[8211.22 → 8212.54] They say LTX 2023
[8212.54 → 8213.48] on the like,
[8213.94 → 8214.84] image frame.
[8217.00 → 8217.68] But yeah,
[8217.74 → 8218.42] I don't know.
[8218.52 → 8218.92] I'm not sure.
[8218.98 → 8220.18] I'm super excited though.
[8220.28 → 8221.08] I'm super excited.
[8221.24 → 8222.16] They're super cool.
[8222.32 → 8222.44] Yeah,
[8222.44 → 8222.94] super sweet.
[8223.26 → 8224.44] We should do some merch messages.
[8224.44 → 8224.88] Dan,
[8224.94 → 8225.34] hit me.
[8225.84 → 8226.52] All right.
[8226.68 → 8228.76] I've got an anonymous one here.
[8228.90 → 8229.50] Linus and Luke
[8229.50 → 8230.98] regarding lab funding.
[8231.46 → 8231.94] Have you thought about
[8231.94 → 8232.94] trying to secure grants
[8232.94 → 8233.54] from the government?
[8233.96 → 8234.74] Consumer research
[8234.74 → 8237.34] and testing
[8237.34 → 8238.02] feels like something
[8238.02 → 8238.86] it might be possible
[8238.86 → 8239.78] to get grants for.
[8240.82 → 8241.92] Are we doing
[8241.92 → 8242.96] any shred credit stuff?
[8245.02 → 8246.50] Not for my team.
[8247.86 → 8249.06] I'm pretty sure.
[8249.06 → 8249.44] Not yet,
[8249.64 → 8250.04] at least.
[8250.14 → 8250.84] I'm pretty sure
[8250.84 → 8251.70] there's some stuff
[8251.70 → 8252.30] that we're doing
[8252.30 → 8253.08] that is eligible
[8253.08 → 8254.36] for shred credits,
[8254.46 → 8255.38] which are like a tax,
[8255.52 → 8256.56] like a tax credit.
[8256.56 → 8260.20] I know that
[8260.20 → 8261.90] for some people
[8261.90 → 8263.44] working on the lab team
[8263.44 → 8264.80] because what they're doing
[8264.80 → 8266.76] is directly involved
[8266.76 → 8267.80] in video production,
[8268.30 → 8269.32] we can be eligible
[8269.32 → 8270.38] for some
[8270.38 → 8273.12] production services tax credits.
[8273.56 → 8274.54] I got to be honest
[8274.54 → 8275.12] with you guys.
[8275.22 → 8276.44] We are not the best
[8276.44 → 8277.56] when it comes to
[8277.56 → 8280.40] optimizing
[8280.40 → 8281.72] our tax credits
[8281.72 → 8282.20] and stuff.
[8282.20 → 8283.44] I don't think
[8283.44 → 8284.02] we've actually,
[8284.46 → 8284.92] like I think
[8284.92 → 8285.54] we've submitted
[8285.54 → 8286.60] but not collected
[8286.60 → 8288.26] any going all the way
[8288.26 → 8289.18] back to like 2018
[8289.18 → 8290.04] or 2019.
[8291.08 → 8292.00] I don't think
[8292.00 → 8292.60] we've submitted
[8292.60 → 8294.12] 2021 or 2022.
[8294.62 → 8296.18] It's not out of laziness.
[8296.34 → 8297.02] It's just extremely
[8297.02 → 8297.62] complicated.
[8298.12 → 8298.66] I know,
[8298.70 → 8299.10] I know,
[8299.30 → 8302.70] I know companies
[8302.70 → 8303.10] downtown
[8303.10 → 8303.90] that are smaller
[8303.90 → 8304.40] than us
[8304.40 → 8306.20] that have employees
[8306.20 → 8307.00] on staff,
[8307.30 → 8307.80] some of them
[8307.80 → 8308.38] more than one,
[8308.82 → 8310.04] who their entire
[8310.04 → 8310.98] full-time job,
[8310.98 → 8312.20] they do nothing else
[8312.20 → 8313.58] is to capture
[8313.58 → 8314.44] government grants.
[8315.78 → 8316.54] And we don't have
[8316.54 → 8317.48] anyone that does that.
[8318.10 → 8318.32] Yeah.
[8318.54 → 8319.66] It actually takes
[8319.66 → 8321.12] like a lot
[8321.12 → 8322.14] of time.
[8322.90 → 8323.84] They make it
[8323.84 → 8325.16] quite the arduous process.
[8325.54 → 8326.24] Which is stupid.
[8326.64 → 8327.12] We've complained
[8327.12 → 8327.82] about this on the show
[8327.82 → 8328.26] before.
[8328.34 → 8328.72] Because it means
[8328.72 → 8330.10] the people who need it most
[8330.10 → 8332.34] have the hardest time
[8332.34 → 8332.96] getting it.
[8333.04 → 8333.24] Yeah.
[8333.60 → 8335.54] Which is stupid.
[8335.82 → 8336.02] Yep.
[8336.24 → 8337.10] We've complained about that
[8337.10 → 8337.90] in regard to
[8337.90 → 8339.40] Cargo publicly before.
[8339.40 → 8340.58] But it's true
[8340.58 → 8341.36] about all of it.
[8341.72 → 8342.20] Like it just,
[8342.84 → 8343.02] yeah.
[8343.36 → 8343.96] People are talking
[8343.96 → 8344.74] about like loopholes
[8344.74 → 8345.40] or avoidance.
[8345.48 → 8346.30] This is not loopholes
[8346.30 → 8346.96] or avoidance.
[8347.12 → 8349.52] This is like
[8349.52 → 8352.02] financial aid
[8352.02 → 8352.66] from the government
[8352.66 → 8353.28] to support
[8353.28 → 8354.02] certain industries.
[8354.14 → 8354.92] And if it's there,
[8355.68 → 8356.48] obviously,
[8356.78 → 8358.00] if we're not idiots,
[8358.58 → 8360.40] we should take it.
[8360.84 → 8360.98] Right?
[8361.10 → 8361.52] Like that's,
[8361.64 → 8364.28] we're not committing fraud.
[8364.38 → 8364.94] These are all things
[8364.94 → 8365.94] that we're eligible for.
[8366.10 → 8367.14] We just need to
[8367.14 → 8369.14] be on top of it.
[8369.14 → 8370.28] We've even been told
[8370.28 → 8370.86] that we're eligible
[8370.86 → 8371.70] for things before.
[8371.90 → 8373.06] Tried to apply for it.
[8373.32 → 8374.78] Ran into a massive wave
[8374.78 → 8375.42] of complications
[8375.42 → 8376.34] and just been like,
[8376.44 → 8376.66] okay,
[8376.68 → 8377.80] we could get this grant
[8377.80 → 8378.90] or we could spend the time
[8378.90 → 8379.68] that it's going to take
[8379.68 → 8380.54] for us to deal with
[8380.54 → 8381.80] all these complications.
[8382.14 → 8382.76] Just making money.
[8382.94 → 8383.26] Yes.
[8384.20 → 8384.94] So every time,
[8385.10 → 8385.44] almost,
[8385.60 → 8386.22] not technically,
[8386.34 → 8387.28] but almost every time
[8387.28 → 8387.96] it's just been like,
[8388.14 → 8388.38] okay,
[8388.58 → 8388.84] well,
[8389.18 → 8389.82] I'm just going to go back
[8389.82 → 8390.20] to work.
[8390.76 → 8391.20] Yeah.
[8392.00 → 8392.96] I hear that.
[8393.14 → 8393.42] Yeah.
[8394.72 → 8395.16] Anyway.
[8395.16 → 8395.80] Yeah.
[8397.08 → 8397.34] Go ahead.
[8397.62 → 8398.22] I've got something
[8398.22 → 8398.98] to clarify about
[8398.98 → 8400.00] the desk pads.
[8400.30 → 8400.46] Oh,
[8400.52 → 8400.68] yeah.
[8400.78 → 8401.80] I'm told that they're
[8401.80 → 8402.76] only going to be available
[8402.76 → 8403.86] at LTX.
[8404.02 → 8404.66] Local only.
[8404.92 → 8405.82] Local only.
[8406.10 → 8406.38] Wow.
[8406.82 → 8407.26] All right.
[8407.50 → 8407.90] Exclusives.
[8408.00 → 8409.00] See you guys at LTX.
[8409.04 → 8409.32] Yeah.
[8409.98 → 8410.38] I was,
[8410.80 → 8412.64] I told you a while ago
[8412.64 → 8413.70] that I was reorganizing
[8413.70 → 8414.00] the stuff.
[8414.08 → 8414.60] I was going through
[8414.60 → 8415.38] all of my like,
[8415.98 → 8416.88] I can't get rid
[8416.88 → 8418.26] of this article of clothing
[8418.26 → 8419.36] because it has significance
[8419.36 → 8420.90] to me stuff.
[8421.02 → 8423.30] I found like the LTX 2017 shirt
[8423.30 → 8424.52] and I found like all this
[8424.52 → 8424.98] other kind of stuff.
[8425.22 → 8426.88] One that I did get rid of,
[8427.72 → 8429.04] but I always felt conflicted on.
[8429.14 → 8430.00] I just had too much.
[8430.06 → 8431.06] I have this like massive
[8431.06 → 8432.30] benefit at this point
[8432.30 → 8433.86] was the
[8433.86 → 8435.98] the berry selling shirt.
[8436.48 → 8436.84] Nice.
[8436.92 → 8437.80] I still had that
[8437.80 → 8438.34] and I was like,
[8438.44 → 8440.26] I think I can get rid of that one.
[8440.30 → 8441.30] I think that would be a fun
[8441.30 → 8442.30] like float plane exclusive.
[8442.70 → 8444.42] You and I compare our bins
[8444.42 → 8445.52] because I have a shirt bin too.
[8445.62 → 8446.84] I was going to ask you
[8446.84 → 8449.54] if you still have your,
[8449.54 → 8450.60] your shirt,
[8450.60 → 8451.48] that's the
[8451.48 → 8453.96] the way like us sitting together
[8453.96 → 8454.42] in the WAN,
[8454.60 → 8455.04] that logo,
[8455.30 → 8456.04] if you still have that shirt
[8456.04 → 8457.22] because I found the sweater.
[8457.66 → 8458.62] You have the sweater?
[8458.70 → 8459.36] I have the sweater.
[8459.50 → 8459.82] Oh.
[8460.22 → 8461.34] We should do like,
[8461.56 → 8462.68] we should do a WAN
[8462.68 → 8463.46] where you're wearing the shirt
[8463.46 → 8464.12] and I'm wearing the sweater.
[8464.16 → 8465.06] I'm totally down.
[8465.08 → 8465.60] That'd be sick.
[8465.62 → 8466.62] We should bring back the design
[8466.62 → 8467.06] now that we have
[8467.06 → 8467.96] a t-shirt printer again.
[8468.10 → 8468.78] Hey, yeah.
[8468.92 → 8469.24] I'd be,
[8469.32 → 8470.26] I'd be super down.
[8470.34 → 8471.60] I also have that like
[8471.60 → 8473.70] ancient like Christmas sweater
[8473.70 → 8474.22] that we had,
[8474.30 → 8475.34] the WAN Christmas sweater.
[8475.46 → 8475.70] Oh yeah,
[8475.70 → 8476.34] that thing was crap.
[8476.34 → 8477.06] Like all this,
[8477.16 → 8477.44] oh yeah,
[8477.50 → 8477.78] it is,
[8477.88 → 8478.42] but yeah,
[8478.56 → 8479.24] I'm keeping it
[8479.24 → 8479.92] because it's just like,
[8479.92 → 8481.38] I've kept a lot less
[8481.38 → 8483.18] of like just old merch
[8483.18 → 8485.78] because like Nick gets mad at me
[8485.78 → 8486.42] if I wear it.
[8487.42 → 8488.06] It's like,
[8488.18 → 8488.46] yo,
[8488.70 → 8491.14] people can't even buy that.
[8491.54 → 8493.86] Like what the f*** are you doing?
[8494.26 → 8494.58] I'm like,
[8494.70 → 8494.98] oh,
[8495.24 → 8495.58] right.
[8495.66 → 8495.90] Okay.
[8496.08 → 8496.36] I guess,
[8496.36 → 8498.00] I guess it's like the frontman.
[8498.12 → 8498.84] I'm supposed to,
[8498.88 → 8500.14] I'm supposed to rep the stuff
[8500.14 → 8501.12] people can currently get,
[8501.20 → 8502.82] which is honestly fine
[8502.82 → 8504.00] because it's always,
[8504.00 → 8505.46] it's always forward and upward,
[8505.62 → 8505.76] right?
[8505.76 → 8507.04] Like we're trying to make better stuff
[8507.04 → 8507.54] all the time,
[8507.62 → 8509.14] but it's a little bit sentimental,
[8509.34 → 8509.58] you know?
[8509.58 → 8510.20] Stuff like that.
[8510.24 → 8510.40] I don't,
[8510.44 → 8511.20] I don't plan on wearing it.
[8511.20 → 8511.50] Like the
[8511.54 → 8512.56] the 2017 shirt,
[8512.62 → 8513.48] like I don't want to wear it
[8513.48 → 8515.52] because I don't want to ever wash it
[8515.52 → 8517.06] because that,
[8517.16 → 8518.60] that logo like is still
[8518.60 → 8519.66] in really nice condition.
[8520.08 → 8520.76] So I don't,
[8520.84 → 8521.70] I don't want to trash it.
[8521.88 → 8522.38] Rod's like,
[8522.44 → 8524.76] I've still got the Mod 24 shirt.
[8526.30 → 8527.06] I do too,
[8527.14 → 8527.34] bro.
[8530.34 → 8531.72] I'm pretty sure I saved that one.
[8531.84 → 8532.98] I know I found it this,
[8533.06 → 8533.92] while I was sorting through,
[8533.98 → 8534.98] I'm pretty sure it got saved.
[8534.98 → 8536.96] I pulled that out and it,
[8537.12 → 8537.28] yeah,
[8537.34 → 8537.70] I don't know.
[8537.82 → 8539.36] I was thinking when you were asking him
[8539.36 → 8540.74] if he was going to come to the event,
[8540.76 → 8541.08] I was like,
[8541.12 → 8541.38] man,
[8541.58 → 8542.98] we were just roasting NVIDIA
[8542.98 → 8543.90] for not paying things,
[8544.32 → 8545.02] but the like,
[8545.12 → 8546.56] one of the very few times
[8546.56 → 8547.96] that they have Mod 24
[8547.96 → 8549.56] was actually super sick.
[8550.18 → 8551.80] They did not pay a lot for it.
[8551.90 → 8552.12] Nope.
[8555.12 → 8556.36] It was a cool event regardless.
[8561.20 → 8561.56] Anywho.
[8561.80 → 8562.24] Moving on.
[8562.36 → 8562.76] Next one.
[8562.76 → 8565.00] Okay.
[8566.24 → 8567.22] This one's from Elizabeth.
[8567.72 → 8567.86] Hi,
[8567.94 → 8568.50] Linus and Luke.
[8568.60 → 8569.44] I've recently entered
[8569.44 → 8570.84] my first professional position
[8570.84 → 8571.98] where I am responsible
[8571.98 → 8573.46] for delegating to others.
[8573.66 → 8575.92] As leaders of your respective teams,
[8576.16 → 8577.12] how do you balance
[8577.12 → 8579.10] delegating and perfectionism?
[8581.68 → 8582.12] Oh.
[8584.82 → 8586.22] I knew that'd get a groan.
[8586.22 → 8590.36] I'm getting better at it.
[8591.16 → 8592.10] You have to,
[8592.10 → 8593.62] I mean,
[8593.62 → 8594.70] it's all training,
[8594.86 → 8595.12] right?
[8595.30 → 8595.70] Like,
[8595.96 → 8597.98] you have to delegate
[8597.98 → 8599.22] with the assumption
[8599.22 → 8600.62] that everything
[8600.62 → 8601.36] they're going to do
[8601.36 → 8601.98] is wrong.
[8602.78 → 8603.30] Or,
[8603.54 → 8605.52] even if it's not wrong,
[8605.62 → 8606.86] it's definitely not
[8606.86 → 8607.74] exactly the way
[8607.74 → 8608.42] you would have done it.
[8608.42 → 8610.16] but making the mistake
[8610.16 → 8611.34] could be a valuable thing.
[8611.86 → 8612.04] Yeah.
[8612.16 → 8612.68] And so,
[8612.84 → 8613.44] sitting down
[8613.44 → 8614.66] and talking through
[8614.66 → 8616.60] how you feel
[8616.60 → 8617.52] it should have been done
[8617.52 → 8618.42] can have
[8618.42 → 8619.94] multiple positive effects.
[8620.08 → 8621.64] It can help them
[8621.64 → 8623.58] to reason through it
[8623.58 → 8624.30] better for themselves
[8624.30 → 8625.02] next time.
[8625.02 → 8625.92] or,
[8626.44 → 8627.00] conversely,
[8627.38 → 8628.20] it could actually
[8628.20 → 8629.50] open you up
[8629.50 → 8630.48] to new perspectives
[8630.48 → 8631.88] and new approaches,
[8632.22 → 8633.04] which is,
[8633.22 → 8633.84] I think,
[8633.92 → 8634.80] one of our biggest
[8634.80 → 8635.72] strengths here
[8635.72 → 8636.68] is that
[8636.68 → 8638.64] no idea
[8638.64 → 8640.20] is automatically stupid
[8640.20 → 8641.34] based on the position
[8641.34 → 8642.66] of whoever proposed it.
[8643.10 → 8643.62] And that's sort of
[8643.62 → 8644.48] a complicated way
[8644.48 → 8645.22] of saying that
[8645.22 → 8646.64] anyone can have
[8646.64 → 8647.26] a valid idea
[8647.26 → 8648.12] for how we can do
[8648.12 → 8648.60] things better.
[8650.14 → 8651.26] And so,
[8652.06 → 8652.48] ah,
[8652.48 → 8656.48] I've had to let
[8656.48 → 8657.20] a lot go
[8657.20 → 8658.34] over the years
[8658.34 → 8659.78] in terms of
[8659.78 → 8660.86] perfectionism.
[8661.22 → 8661.92] I'm not going to
[8661.92 → 8662.64] call out anything,
[8663.16 → 8664.58] anything specific,
[8664.78 → 8665.02] but, like,
[8665.04 → 8665.80] I watched a video
[8665.80 → 8666.90] recently where I kind of
[8666.90 → 8667.32] went, like,
[8667.36 → 8668.40] in the first two minutes
[8668.40 → 8669.34] there were four
[8669.34 → 8670.56] obvious moments
[8670.56 → 8671.12] where I was like,
[8671.80 → 8672.06] well,
[8672.10 → 8672.62] there should have been
[8672.62 → 8673.66] like,
[8673.88 → 8674.78] the thing I was talking
[8674.78 → 8675.08] about,
[8675.28 → 8675.88] there should have been
[8675.88 → 8676.64] an image on screen
[8676.64 → 8676.88] of it,
[8676.96 → 8677.06] like,
[8677.14 → 8677.48] what,
[8677.58 → 8678.04] this is supposed
[8678.04 → 8678.64] to imagine?
[8678.74 → 8679.10] What's the point
[8679.10 → 8679.66] of this even being
[8679.66 → 8680.02] a video?
[8680.14 → 8680.60] Why don't we just
[8680.60 → 8681.64] upload it as an
[8681.64 → 8682.32] audio clip?
[8682.48 → 8682.70] Yeah.
[8682.80 → 8683.16] Like,
[8683.26 → 8683.44] you know,
[8683.46 → 8684.10] little things like
[8684.10 → 8684.32] that,
[8684.36 → 8684.52] you know,
[8684.56 → 8684.98] obviously,
[8685.16 → 8685.36] I'm,
[8685.56 → 8685.66] you know,
[8685.68 → 8686.02] I can be,
[8686.10 → 8687.44] I can be pretty
[8687.44 → 8687.80] demanding,
[8687.90 → 8688.48] I can be pretty
[8688.48 → 8688.80] picky,
[8689.40 → 8694.00] but the best way
[8694.00 → 8694.60] to move forward
[8694.60 → 8695.32] with that is to
[8695.32 → 8696.22] just have those
[8696.22 → 8696.78] conversations,
[8697.02 → 8697.46] figure out what
[8697.46 → 8698.26] the rationale was,
[8698.28 → 8698.90] and then figure out
[8698.90 → 8700.14] how to best move
[8700.14 → 8700.40] forward.
[8700.56 → 8701.06] That's the only way
[8701.06 → 8701.64] you can do it.
[8706.52 → 8707.28] Safe answer.
[8708.72 → 8709.58] It's a good one,
[8709.66 → 8709.78] though.
[8709.88 → 8710.04] I don't know,
[8710.08 → 8710.48] that's fine.
[8710.50 → 8711.14] The best answer
[8711.14 → 8712.00] is not an answer.
[8712.00 → 8713.50] Up next is from
[8713.50 → 8713.96] Austin.
[8714.46 → 8714.90] Luke,
[8715.10 → 8715.82] what will you
[8715.82 → 8716.62] play now
[8716.62 → 8717.52] that Markov
[8717.52 → 8718.70] is not an
[8718.70 → 8718.92] option?
[8719.60 → 8720.04] Honestly,
[8720.14 → 8721.10] I haven't been
[8721.10 → 8721.84] playing much.
[8723.52 → 8724.40] I have to
[8724.40 → 8725.34] confess that I
[8725.34 → 8725.82] might have to
[8725.82 → 8726.62] extend the AMD
[8726.62 → 8727.34] challenge because
[8727.34 → 8728.42] I haven't touched
[8728.42 → 8729.30] my gaming computer.
[8732.44 → 8733.60] Gaming is dead.
[8733.70 → 8734.28] You heard it here
[8734.28 → 8734.68] first.
[8734.80 → 8735.74] I will say,
[8735.90 → 8736.50] I've been really
[8736.50 → 8736.84] busy.
[8736.84 → 8737.86] based on some
[8737.86 → 8738.44] of the things
[8738.44 → 8738.74] that have
[8738.74 → 8739.24] happened,
[8739.64 → 8741.14] like the
[8741.14 → 8742.20] arrests and
[8742.20 → 8743.06] the server
[8743.06 → 8743.88] seizures and
[8743.88 → 8744.20] all these
[8744.20 → 8745.00] massive band
[8745.00 → 8745.56] waves that
[8745.56 → 8746.42] BSG has been
[8746.42 → 8746.64] doing,
[8746.72 → 8747.02] stuff like
[8747.02 → 8747.22] that.
[8748.06 → 8748.68] Returning to
[8748.68 → 8749.24] Markov might
[8749.24 → 8751.02] be fairly
[8751.02 → 8752.04] realistic fairly
[8752.04 → 8752.34] soon.
[8752.48 → 8753.12] I was expecting
[8753.12 → 8753.54] it was going to
[8753.54 → 8754.54] be potentially
[8754.54 → 8756.86] ever or at
[8756.86 → 8757.44] least a year,
[8757.66 → 8758.44] but it might be
[8758.44 → 8758.86] a relatively
[8758.86 → 8759.62] short-term thing
[8759.62 → 8759.92] for me to
[8759.92 → 8760.44] return to it.
[8760.44 → 8761.32] I've been
[8761.32 → 8761.76] busy,
[8761.90 → 8762.08] man.
[8762.20 → 8762.40] I've been
[8762.40 → 8762.68] doing other
[8762.68 → 8763.00] stuff.
[8763.10 → 8763.42] There's a lot
[8763.42 → 8764.50] going on in
[8764.50 → 8767.02] my life that
[8767.02 → 8767.36] isn't on
[8767.36 → 8767.84] Sancho right
[8767.84 → 8768.04] now.
[8769.20 → 8770.04] I don't know.
[8770.14 → 8770.48] I haven't been
[8770.48 → 8771.10] gaming a ton,
[8771.46 → 8772.12] but that's
[8772.12 → 8772.30] okay.
[8773.20 → 8774.40] This is great.
[8774.50 → 8775.02] Back to our
[8775.02 → 8775.56] last one,
[8775.80 → 8776.28] AJ in
[8776.28 → 8776.66] float plane
[8776.66 → 8776.98] chat.
[8777.38 → 8777.86] To beat my
[8777.86 → 8778.54] perfectionism,
[8778.66 → 8778.94] I just
[8778.94 → 8779.90] procrastinate until
[8779.90 → 8780.42] I don't have
[8780.42 → 8781.02] time to do it
[8781.02 → 8781.46] perfectly.
[8785.54 → 8786.18] You're not
[8786.18 → 8786.72] supposed to
[8786.72 → 8787.60] say that.
[8787.94 → 8788.16] Yeah.
[8789.08 → 8790.02] Your boss and
[8790.02 → 8790.56] your boss's
[8790.56 → 8790.88] boss.
[8791.82 → 8792.64] It's taking
[8792.64 → 8793.62] everything in my
[8793.62 → 8794.24] power to not
[8794.24 → 8795.20] say mood right
[8795.20 → 8796.10] now.
[8796.44 → 8797.12] Damn it!
[8797.66 → 8798.16] Oh, God.
[8798.40 → 8798.64] I've been
[8798.64 → 8799.24] both these
[8799.24 → 8799.68] meatballs!
[8799.88 → 8800.54] Same problem!
[8800.68 → 8801.16] Stop it!
[8801.60 → 8802.26] We're very
[8802.26 → 8802.64] alike.
[8804.62 → 8805.18] No.
[8807.30 → 8808.20] See, the trick
[8808.20 → 8809.00] here is I just
[8809.00 → 8810.72] give AJ too
[8810.72 → 8811.34] much stuff,
[8811.70 → 8812.56] so he doesn't
[8812.56 → 8813.14] have, like,
[8814.48 → 8815.16] he has to work
[8815.16 → 8815.56] all the time
[8815.56 → 8816.02] anyway.
[8816.54 → 8817.18] Oh, my gosh.
[8817.40 → 8818.38] I find that if
[8818.38 → 8819.14] you tell him to
[8819.14 → 8819.62] do that,
[8819.62 → 8819.86] that.
[8819.86 → 8819.92] Solution
[8819.92 → 8820.50] solved.
[8820.64 → 8820.98] I don't want
[8820.98 → 8821.66] to hear any of
[8821.66 → 8822.62] this from any
[8822.62 → 8823.10] of you.
[8823.62 → 8824.02] If you tell me
[8824.02 → 8824.90] to do it within
[8824.90 → 8825.72] the next hour,
[8825.94 → 8826.80] and it's like a
[8826.80 → 8827.66] six-hour project,
[8828.22 → 8828.82] then you'll get
[8828.82 → 8829.82] it in an hour and
[8829.82 → 8830.40] a half, and it'll
[8830.40 → 8831.14] be good and done.
[8833.10 → 8833.92] That's how Luke
[8833.92 → 8834.30] manages.
[8835.36 → 8836.24] It's been going
[8836.24 → 8836.70] great.
[8838.16 → 8839.36] Tell him what
[8839.36 → 8840.48] you told me
[8840.48 → 8841.30] earlier about how
[8841.30 → 8842.36] it's been working
[8842.36 → 8843.36] under my team.
[8843.44 → 8844.00] Oh, yeah.
[8844.34 → 8845.10] It's very
[8845.10 → 8845.66] stressful.
[8845.66 → 8849.12] Sorry.
[8850.12 → 8850.74] But Luke is
[8850.74 → 8851.76] turning me into a
[8851.76 → 8852.72] confident person,
[8852.96 → 8855.40] because I, I don't
[8855.40 → 8856.12] know, I scheduled a
[8856.12 → 8856.32] meeting.
[8856.44 → 8857.12] Don't say the
[8857.12 → 8858.06] company, but say the
[8858.06 → 8858.34] story.
[8858.68 → 8859.68] Yeah, I scheduled a
[8859.68 → 8859.90] meeting.
[8860.12 → 8860.92] Like, we needed to
[8860.92 → 8861.72] get this thing done,
[8861.84 → 8863.64] and I sent an email
[8863.64 → 8864.18] to the company.
[8864.30 → 8865.26] Hello, can I please
[8865.26 → 8866.26] have a meeting with
[8866.26 → 8866.76] your team?
[8866.76 → 8869.64] And they went,
[8869.76 → 8870.44] yeah, how about
[8870.44 → 8870.76] Friday?
[8870.94 → 8872.20] And then I kind of
[8872.20 → 8872.80] was in another
[8872.80 → 8873.92] meeting, freaked out,
[8874.00 → 8875.10] and went, no, this
[8875.10 → 8876.06] has to be tomorrow at
[8876.06 → 8876.36] 11.
[8876.48 → 8877.32] Answer my question
[8877.32 → 8878.14] instead of scheduling
[8878.14 → 8878.62] a meeting.
[8879.24 → 8879.74] And then he went,
[8879.80 → 8880.32] okay, how about
[8880.32 → 8880.90] tomorrow at 11?
[8881.02 → 8881.80] No, this has to be
[8881.80 → 8882.44] at 8.30.
[8882.48 → 8883.12] We're having this
[8883.12 → 8884.00] meeting right now.
[8884.90 → 8885.08] What?
[8885.42 → 8886.30] And then the meeting
[8886.30 → 8887.02] happened, and we got
[8887.02 → 8887.94] it's done, and everything's
[8887.94 → 8888.78] been, like, full steam
[8888.78 → 8889.08] ahead.
[8889.36 → 8890.46] We shipped on time.
[8890.68 → 8891.60] Let's go, boys!
[8891.60 → 8892.60] I felt like a big
[8892.60 → 8893.88] boy man person.
[8893.88 → 8897.30] No, I want productivity,
[8897.60 → 8897.92] please.
[8898.42 → 8899.06] Let's go!
[8899.06 → 8899.62] Give me the productivity.
[8901.38 → 8902.28] I mean, should we
[8902.28 → 8902.96] I did a business.
[8903.12 → 8903.78] Should we announce
[8903.78 → 8904.58] your role change?
[8905.64 → 8906.00] I don't know.
[8906.20 → 8906.82] I don't really care.
[8907.02 → 8911.36] Okay, so Luke is out
[8911.36 → 8914.38] as CTO, or whatever the
[8914.38 → 8915.20] heck his role was at
[8915.20 → 8915.80] Float Play Media,
[8915.94 → 8916.50] which is a lie,
[8916.56 → 8917.16] because he actually
[8917.16 → 8918.02] retains that role.
[8918.66 → 8919.22] Yeah, what?
[8919.22 → 8923.54] He's now officially
[8923.54 → 8924.54] back in the Linus
[8924.54 → 8925.50] Media Group, Inc.
[8925.74 → 8927.48] fold as our CTO,
[8927.86 → 8929.34] and he's going to be
[8929.34 → 8930.58] just kind of
[8930.58 → 8935.04] UN-haphazarding
[8935.04 → 8937.26] things, whether it's
[8937.26 → 8938.78] the migration from
[8938.78 → 8940.58] LastPass or some of
[8940.58 → 8943.06] our data resiliency
[8943.06 → 8945.76] practices or whether
[8945.76 → 8947.04] it's our documentation.
[8947.36 → 8948.72] There are things that he's
[8948.72 → 8950.46] gotten perfect at
[8950.46 → 8952.00] with his team over at
[8952.00 → 8952.90] Float Plane over the
[8952.90 → 8953.76] last five years.
[8954.04 → 8955.46] And to be clear to my
[8955.46 → 8956.80] team over at Float Plane,
[8956.90 → 8958.26] nothing is changing there.
[8958.44 → 8959.90] He worded that really
[8959.90 → 8960.32] poorly.
[8960.62 → 8961.22] Well, yeah, I did that
[8961.22 → 8961.58] on purpose.
[8961.66 → 8962.08] I know.
[8962.26 → 8963.02] Everything's fine.
[8964.90 → 8966.14] I know for sure he's
[8966.14 → 8966.90] going to get at least
[8966.90 → 8967.86] one phone call tonight.
[8969.00 → 8970.62] And no, I'm not the
[8970.62 → 8971.70] CTO of Float Plane.
[8971.74 → 8972.58] I don't think it has one.
[8972.64 → 8974.02] Yeah, I don't even know
[8974.02 → 8974.62] what you're trying to
[8974.62 → 8974.78] think.
[8974.78 → 8975.78] I think COO.
[8975.78 → 8976.54] Probably be AJ.
[8976.66 → 8977.30] Yeah, COO.
[8977.46 → 8977.56] Yeah.
[8977.56 → 8979.46] So he's going to be CTO
[8979.46 → 8980.88] at Linus Media Group to
[8980.88 → 8983.40] help us take everything
[8983.40 → 8984.66] that's perfect at
[8984.66 → 8986.14] Float Plane technology
[8986.14 → 8988.84] wise and also do it here
[8988.84 → 8991.34] because no offence to
[8991.34 → 8993.64] some of the people who work
[8993.64 → 8994.70] on some of the tech stuff
[8994.70 → 8995.10] here.
[8997.10 → 8997.42] No.
[8997.42 → 8998.82] Okay, I will actually come
[8998.82 → 8999.54] to their defence
[8999.54 → 9000.08] specifically.
[9000.22 → 9000.66] Oh, I know.
[9000.72 → 9001.96] In my opinion, with the
[9001.96 → 9003.04] time and the resources
[9003.04 → 9003.94] that have been given,
[9004.24 → 9005.88] it's been amazing what
[9005.88 → 9006.46] has been accomplished.
[9006.48 → 9007.34] The fact that we have
[9007.34 → 9008.64] the kind of uptime we do
[9008.64 → 9010.90] is a testament to the
[9010.90 → 9012.56] work that guys like Jake
[9012.56 → 9015.64] and Dan and Jamie have
[9015.64 → 9017.64] put in to have our
[9017.64 → 9018.72] security system always
[9018.72 → 9019.08] works.
[9019.62 → 9020.58] You know, things like
[9020.58 → 9020.76] that.
[9020.76 → 9022.26] The fact that stuff works
[9022.26 → 9023.24] at all is like...
[9023.24 → 9024.20] It's made of duct tape
[9024.20 → 9026.46] and popsicle sticks, but
[9026.46 → 9028.46] it actually functions.
[9028.50 → 9028.78] Yeah.
[9029.18 → 9029.92] Which is remarkable.
[9030.24 → 9030.82] Perfect.
[9031.02 → 9032.46] The problem is that
[9032.46 → 9033.86] their time is also
[9033.86 → 9035.00] leveraged in other ways.
[9035.16 → 9035.92] Everyone that's been
[9035.92 → 9036.98] working on it, it hasn't
[9036.98 → 9037.86] been their main thing.
[9038.26 → 9039.20] So then they're pulled
[9039.20 → 9039.86] constantly.
[9039.96 → 9041.02] They're pulled constantly
[9041.02 → 9041.66] in other directions.
[9042.44 → 9043.30] And things were...
[9043.30 → 9044.64] It's been 80-20 ruled
[9044.64 → 9047.70] like on the line for a
[9047.70 → 9048.24] long time.
[9048.32 → 9049.62] 20% of the work, 80% of
[9049.62 → 9050.00] the result.
[9050.32 → 9051.50] They've lived by that
[9051.50 → 9051.70] rule.
[9052.00 → 9053.24] But certain things have
[9053.24 → 9054.16] been left out, and we're
[9054.16 → 9055.52] getting to a size.
[9055.64 → 9056.42] We're getting to a stage
[9056.42 → 9057.58] where that can't really
[9057.58 → 9058.40] keep happening.
[9058.58 → 9059.34] We can't keep doing it.
[9059.36 → 9060.44] And certain things are
[9060.44 → 9061.22] starting to fail.
[9061.36 → 9062.24] Certain edge cases are
[9062.24 → 9062.88] starting to fail and
[9062.88 → 9063.72] they're impacting pretty
[9063.72 → 9063.94] hard.
[9064.10 → 9066.12] So hoping to help solve
[9066.12 → 9066.46] that.
[9067.12 → 9068.44] This does not mean that
[9068.44 → 9069.68] you're not going to see
[9069.68 → 9071.68] like infrastructure tech
[9071.68 → 9072.98] videos from Jake anymore.
[9072.98 → 9073.72] Yeah, totally.
[9073.90 → 9075.30] I'm planning on setting up
[9075.30 → 9076.18] the system so that you
[9076.18 → 9077.56] will see exactly as much
[9077.56 → 9077.90] of that.
[9077.94 → 9078.38] Maybe more.
[9078.38 → 9078.86] Actually, maybe.
[9079.00 → 9079.12] Yeah.
[9079.18 → 9080.08] Because he should be less
[9080.08 → 9082.00] busy with just like random
[9082.00 → 9083.14] administrative nonsense.
[9083.14 → 9083.98] We don't want him to do
[9083.98 → 9084.74] maintenance stuff.
[9084.74 → 9085.76] We don't want him to do
[9085.76 → 9086.62] documentation.
[9086.94 → 9087.54] We don't want him to do
[9087.54 → 9088.46] all these different things
[9088.46 → 9089.36] that really don't want him
[9089.36 → 9090.04] to do documentation.
[9090.92 → 9092.28] But he should still be able
[9092.28 → 9094.10] to have fun and experiment
[9094.10 → 9095.06] with things and try things
[9095.06 → 9095.92] out and then show that on
[9095.92 → 9097.42] video and have that be cool
[9097.42 → 9097.86] for everyone.
[9098.00 → 9099.46] So there will not be any
[9099.46 → 9100.12] less of that.
[9100.46 → 9101.40] And yeah, the goal is
[9101.40 → 9102.80] is potentially even more if
[9102.80 → 9104.04] if he wants to do more.
[9104.28 → 9106.50] So, yeah, that's that's my
[9106.50 → 9106.80] stance.
[9106.80 → 9107.00] Yeah.
[9107.00 → 9107.88] So it's exciting.
[9110.52 → 9111.32] Hit me, Dan.
[9111.32 → 9112.46] Okay.
[9113.26 → 9114.26] Lord knows I deserve it
[9114.26 → 9114.56] today.
[9115.26 → 9115.66] Yeah.
[9115.66 → 9116.70] For those comments.
[9118.44 → 9119.62] This one's from Max.
[9119.64 → 9120.34] I do my best.
[9120.74 → 9121.48] This one's from Max.
[9121.80 → 9122.98] Hey, from Guernsey, where's
[9122.98 → 9124.18] the weirdest place that
[9124.18 → 9125.62] you've seen LDT store
[9125.62 → 9126.40] purchases from?
[9127.12 → 9128.66] Oh, so I curated this one
[9128.66 → 9131.22] because I'm going to steal
[9131.22 → 9133.18] one, which was the figure
[9133.18 → 9133.52] skater.
[9134.20 → 9134.72] Oh, yeah.
[9134.74 → 9135.40] That was awesome.
[9135.50 → 9136.48] That was so sick.
[9136.60 → 9136.78] Yeah.
[9137.10 → 9138.84] Our water bottle showed up
[9138.84 → 9140.18] in an Olympic broadcaster.
[9140.18 → 9140.66] Yeah.
[9140.80 → 9141.54] Oh, shoot.
[9141.62 → 9142.20] What's his name?
[9142.74 → 9143.54] I follow him on Twitter,
[9143.62 → 9144.42] but I don't remember off
[9144.42 → 9144.92] the top of my head.
[9146.22 → 9147.46] I feel like I usually can,
[9147.52 → 9148.10] but I don't remember right
[9148.10 → 9148.66] now.
[9150.70 → 9151.06] Canadian.
[9155.24 → 9156.00] I'll find it.
[9156.10 → 9156.62] I'll find it.
[9162.22 → 9163.22] Trying to find.
[9165.90 → 9166.26] Nope.
[9166.42 → 9167.18] I'm having a really hard
[9167.18 → 9167.70] time finding it.
[9167.70 → 9168.68] Anyway, it was super cool.
[9168.68 → 9171.24] So I'm pretty sure we sent
[9171.24 → 9173.26] over a care package.
[9173.58 → 9173.68] Yeah.
[9173.78 → 9174.02] Yeah.
[9174.06 → 9175.26] That was awesome.
[9175.46 → 9176.64] Just like seeing the water
[9176.64 → 9177.82] bottle out in the wild,
[9177.98 → 9179.54] like just casually supporting
[9179.54 → 9180.40] an elite athlete,
[9180.64 → 9181.64] keeping him hydrated.
[9182.02 → 9183.04] That was super cool.
[9184.36 → 9184.74] All right.
[9184.80 → 9185.60] Hit me with another, Dan.
[9187.00 → 9187.68] I think it's like...
[9189.12 → 9190.38] I'll find it.
[9190.94 → 9191.80] Linus and Luke have
[9191.80 → 9192.82] recently entered my
[9192.82 → 9194.14] first professional position
[9194.14 → 9195.22] where I'm responsible for
[9195.22 → 9196.28] delegating to others.
[9196.28 → 9198.54] Oh, wait.
[9198.62 → 9199.06] This one.
[9199.22 → 9200.42] Oh, we curated one
[9200.42 → 9200.96] on top of it.
[9201.00 → 9201.72] We did this one.
[9201.86 → 9202.26] Yeah.
[9202.26 → 9202.42] Yeah.
[9202.52 → 9202.90] Sorry.
[9203.84 → 9204.98] Long time watcher for time
[9204.98 → 9206.12] to purchase a commenter.
[9206.22 → 9206.82] I was thinking about
[9206.82 → 9207.72] beds last night.
[9208.00 → 9208.40] Okay.
[9209.40 → 9210.16] Me too.
[9210.24 → 9210.96] As you do.
[9211.66 → 9213.14] What cool bed tech
[9213.14 → 9214.20] would you like to see?
[9214.32 → 9215.40] A holographic screen
[9215.40 → 9216.34] helps you find...
[9216.34 → 9217.44] Roman Wazowski.
[9217.66 → 9218.12] I thought it was
[9218.12 → 9219.30] Sapolsky and I couldn't
[9219.30 → 9219.78] quite find it.
[9219.84 → 9220.40] Roman Wazowski.
[9220.58 → 9220.88] Sorry.
[9221.10 → 9222.22] That was really rude.
[9222.72 → 9223.84] What bed tech
[9223.84 → 9224.74] would you like to see?
[9225.98 → 9226.88] I mean, you've got
[9226.88 → 9227.66] a cool bed now.
[9227.86 → 9228.08] Yeah.
[9228.94 → 9229.62] Didn't you do it?
[9229.62 → 9230.00] I thought you were
[9230.00 → 9230.38] going to do it.
[9230.46 → 9230.72] Yeah.
[9231.04 → 9231.94] I'm using it.
[9232.00 → 9232.84] I don't know that I like
[9232.84 → 9233.76] it as much as you do.
[9233.90 → 9234.06] Oh.
[9234.18 → 9235.38] So we're both playing
[9235.38 → 9236.14] around with the
[9236.14 → 9237.50] Sleep 8 or 8 Sleep.
[9237.84 → 9238.62] The 8 Sleep.
[9239.68 → 9240.84] I kind of find
[9240.84 → 9242.84] that it's either...
[9243.70 → 9245.54] Like, when I have it on...
[9245.54 → 9245.80] Okay.
[9245.92 → 9246.56] Both of us run
[9246.56 → 9247.42] pretty warm at night
[9247.42 → 9248.52] compared to our SO's.
[9249.18 → 9251.30] And I kind of find...
[9251.30 → 9252.08] Oh, Dan was muted.
[9252.08 → 9252.74] I'm aware.
[9252.74 → 9252.80] Okay.
[9253.20 → 9255.10] Basically, bed tech ideas.
[9255.36 → 9255.52] Yeah.
[9255.88 → 9257.62] I find that it's either
[9257.62 → 9258.74] really warm...
[9258.74 → 9259.68] Okay, how do I put this?
[9259.90 → 9260.92] I don't really, like,
[9261.28 → 9262.52] just stay on one side
[9262.52 → 9263.86] of the bed a lot.
[9264.72 → 9265.24] What?
[9265.28 → 9265.84] I'm a cuddle.
[9267.12 → 9268.58] So, because Yvonne
[9268.58 → 9269.38] runs her side
[9269.38 → 9270.00] with the heater,
[9270.48 → 9272.56] what ends up happening
[9272.56 → 9273.46] is if I move around
[9273.46 → 9274.00] in the night,
[9274.34 → 9275.52] I'm either boiling
[9275.52 → 9276.42] because I'm, like,
[9276.60 → 9277.48] over the threshold
[9277.48 → 9278.26] to her side,
[9278.42 → 9280.00] or I'm freezing
[9280.00 → 9282.04] because I got all sweaty
[9282.04 → 9282.78] on her side
[9282.78 → 9284.24] and I'm on my chilled side.
[9284.82 → 9285.68] And I just...
[9285.68 → 9286.02] I don't know.
[9286.10 → 9287.02] I'm actually...
[9287.02 → 9288.48] I'm not really liking it
[9288.48 → 9288.88] that much.
[9288.94 → 9289.96] But I also don't have
[9289.96 → 9290.56] the subscription.
[9291.32 → 9291.70] So I...
[9291.70 → 9292.96] So their function
[9292.96 → 9293.20] where it's supposed to...
[9293.20 → 9293.46] Oh, you don't have
[9293.46 → 9294.44] the autopilot thing.
[9294.48 → 9295.30] ...keep you at the right
[9295.30 → 9296.06] temperature all the time
[9296.06 → 9296.70] doesn't work.
[9296.78 → 9298.02] You just have to set this, like,
[9298.42 → 9301.24] super coarse adjustment
[9301.24 → 9303.42] for, like, a curve
[9303.42 → 9304.20] to be cooler
[9304.20 → 9304.90] in the middle of the night,
[9304.96 → 9305.26] apparently,
[9305.36 → 9306.10] or something like that.
[9306.10 → 9307.36] And it's not great.
[9307.68 → 9308.46] But I'm not...
[9308.46 → 9309.50] I'm not paying
[9309.50 → 9310.82] a subscription fee
[9310.82 → 9312.72] for a $3,000 mattress topper.
[9312.80 → 9313.38] That's absurd.
[9314.22 → 9315.54] So I just...
[9315.54 → 9316.04] It's going to knock
[9316.04 → 9316.68] to a fan, bro.
[9317.02 → 9317.62] It does.
[9317.74 → 9318.56] Like, oh,
[9318.64 → 9319.36] that's the thing.
[9320.66 → 9321.26] Maybe...
[9321.26 → 9322.24] And maybe it's worth it.
[9322.40 → 9323.02] Like, maybe...
[9323.02 → 9324.16] Maybe by that time...
[9324.16 → 9324.54] Have you looked
[9324.54 → 9325.16] into the specs
[9325.16 → 9326.46] of the actual computer
[9326.46 → 9327.30] that, like, runs it?
[9327.36 → 9327.98] Yeah, it's, like,
[9328.20 → 9328.90] actually...
[9328.90 → 9329.62] Surprisingly, like,
[9329.74 → 9330.20] oh, wow.
[9330.38 → 9330.96] Yeah, but I already
[9330.96 → 9331.92] bought the computer.
[9332.22 → 9332.42] Yeah.
[9332.48 → 9332.84] I just...
[9332.84 → 9333.92] I find it so offensive.
[9334.12 → 9334.58] No, I hear you.
[9335.02 → 9336.02] But, like...
[9336.02 → 9337.16] Okay, it's not like
[9337.16 → 9339.16] there aren't subscription services
[9339.16 → 9340.26] that I do pay for.
[9340.32 → 9341.28] I pay for, like,
[9341.44 → 9342.00] Nebulas,
[9342.66 → 9344.10] the Home Assistant
[9344.10 → 9344.86] Cloud subscription.
[9344.86 → 9345.40] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9345.50 → 9346.16] And it's not even
[9346.16 → 9347.04] the only way to do that.
[9347.12 → 9348.26] You can work around it
[9348.26 → 9349.18] with your own thing,
[9349.24 → 9349.82] but it's just...
[9349.82 → 9350.74] It's way more convenient.
[9350.86 → 9351.90] It's, like, $5 a month
[9351.90 → 9352.68] or something like that.
[9352.86 → 9353.50] And honestly,
[9353.60 → 9354.20] for the bed,
[9354.40 → 9355.02] maybe I...
[9355.02 → 9356.60] Maybe I just should
[9356.60 → 9357.52] because it would be
[9357.52 → 9358.20] more comfortable
[9358.20 → 9358.66] or whatever.
[9358.78 → 9359.58] But, like...
[9359.58 → 9360.26] I mean, you've been
[9360.26 → 9361.18] pretty happy with it, I think.
[9361.20 → 9363.04] I've had a good experience.
[9363.68 → 9365.78] I find AC off.
[9365.78 → 9366.24] It's not...
[9366.24 → 9366.92] It's not...
[9366.92 → 9367.12] It's not...
[9367.12 → 9367.42] It's not...
[9367.42 → 9367.92] It's not...
[9367.92 → 9368.04] It's not...
[9368.04 → 9368.24] It's not...
[9368.24 → 9369.02] It doesn't completely
[9369.02 → 9369.92] solve it for me
[9369.92 → 9370.92] because...
[9370.92 → 9372.66] Even with...
[9372.66 → 9373.36] So, it's minimum
[9373.36 → 9375.16] possible temperature
[9375.16 → 9377.66] is negative 10 degrees.
[9377.92 → 9379.28] Is it actually running at that?
[9379.28 → 9381.98] I don't think so.
[9382.48 → 9383.60] But it feels pretty cold.
[9384.06 → 9385.66] But I am a big boy
[9385.66 → 9387.42] and I am running very hot.
[9387.74 → 9389.52] So, it'll get into a situation
[9389.52 → 9390.80] where, like, my...
[9390.80 → 9391.82] If I'm laying on my back,
[9392.02 → 9393.16] my, like, back will be
[9393.16 → 9393.84] a nice temperature,
[9394.32 → 9395.98] but my, like, chest is roasting.
[9396.42 → 9396.78] Yes.
[9396.86 → 9397.62] Because it's not enough
[9397.62 → 9399.48] to, like, get all the way
[9399.48 → 9399.86] through me.
[9399.90 → 9401.88] So, you need a cooled blanket, too.
[9402.18 → 9403.04] I need a cooled, like...
[9403.04 → 9404.46] Which would be inherently weighted.
[9404.62 → 9405.32] And weighted blankets
[9405.32 → 9406.14] are apparently perfect.
[9406.14 → 9406.98] So, you need a cooled,
[9407.12 → 9407.52] weighted blanket.
[9407.52 → 9408.50] My favourite...
[9408.50 → 9409.04] LTGstore.com.
[9409.10 → 9409.70] Next project.
[9410.10 → 9410.98] Kyle, are you watching?
[9411.06 → 9411.60] Let's go.
[9411.78 → 9413.18] The thing right now
[9413.18 → 9414.14] that has made it
[9414.14 → 9415.04] so I get just, like,
[9415.18 → 9416.80] actually amazing sleeps
[9416.80 → 9419.28] is when it's so hot
[9419.28 → 9420.78] that we need to turn the AC on
[9420.78 → 9423.10] and then I can bundle a bit
[9423.10 → 9424.20] and take, like...
[9424.20 → 9424.38] Yeah.
[9424.38 → 9425.94] Instead of the thinnest blanket
[9425.94 → 9426.94] I've ever found
[9426.94 → 9427.86] on the market,
[9428.00 → 9429.30] which is what I normally sleep with,
[9429.60 → 9430.60] I can actually have, like,
[9430.60 → 9431.58] a thicker blanket on
[9431.58 → 9432.92] and I have the 8 sleep
[9432.92 → 9433.88] at the lowest temperature
[9433.88 → 9434.72] it can possibly go
[9434.72 → 9435.96] and the AC on
[9435.96 → 9436.76] that I'm like,
[9436.82 → 9437.42] oh, wow.
[9437.62 → 9439.50] I am a cozy boy
[9439.50 → 9440.50] and then I sleep
[9440.50 → 9441.70] super, super well
[9441.70 → 9442.82] and I feel very rejuvenated
[9442.82 → 9443.18] in the morning.
[9443.78 → 9444.62] Ooh, Tynan's in the chat.
[9444.72 → 9446.52] It isn't quite enough
[9446.52 → 9448.26] just on its own.
[9448.94 → 9449.92] But it helps.
[9450.86 → 9451.26] So,
[9451.82 → 9454.50] it's way better with it
[9454.50 → 9455.14] for me.
[9455.36 → 9455.60] Yeah.
[9455.68 → 9457.00] But it's not 100%
[9457.00 → 9458.04] of what I could hope for
[9458.04 → 9458.68] if that makes sense.
[9459.66 → 9460.98] But I still like it.
[9460.98 → 9461.68] I wouldn't recommend it
[9461.68 → 9462.10] for everyone
[9462.10 → 9462.98] because it's really expensive.
[9463.24 → 9464.16] It's really expensive.
[9464.16 → 9465.12] But, like,
[9465.86 → 9466.72] it does help me.
[9468.22 → 9469.10] Man, other stuff,
[9469.16 → 9469.40] I don't know.
[9469.44 → 9470.40] If anything could magically
[9470.40 → 9471.28] cure my insomnia,
[9471.42 → 9472.12] I'd be down for that.
[9472.22 → 9472.90] Like, I don't need
[9472.90 → 9474.18] another device to tell me
[9474.18 → 9475.12] you had a terrible
[9475.12 → 9476.22] f***ING sleep last night.
[9476.28 → 9477.06] It's like, yeah, thanks.
[9477.40 → 9477.66] Yep.
[9478.74 → 9479.88] All right, what's next?
[9480.14 → 9480.44] Yep.
[9481.40 → 9482.86] All right, let's have a look.
[9483.14 → 9483.70] Oh my goodness,
[9483.80 → 9484.46] the merch messages
[9484.46 → 9485.60] are coming in too fast
[9485.60 → 9486.34] for poor Dan
[9486.34 → 9487.82] to read them to us
[9487.82 → 9489.24] and also curate
[9489.24 → 9489.94] and reply to them.
[9490.44 → 9490.90] Yeah, sorry,
[9490.90 → 9491.72] I'm not ready for,
[9491.88 → 9493.06] I'm doing other things.
[9493.70 → 9494.92] This one's from Maxwell.
[9496.42 → 9496.90] Hey, Luke,
[9497.28 → 9498.52] a couple of Wands ago,
[9498.92 → 9499.80] you mentioned a viewer
[9499.80 → 9500.96] in Antarctica.
[9501.82 → 9503.00] Sorry, that was me.
[9503.16 → 9504.30] I work in McCurdy,
[9504.64 → 9505.70] a U.S. station.
[9506.16 → 9506.84] I was wondering
[9506.84 → 9508.10] what you guys had to do
[9508.10 → 9508.94] to make the surface
[9508.94 → 9509.82] work better.
[9510.02 → 9511.04] 100% honestly,
[9511.10 → 9511.76] I don't remember,
[9511.86 → 9512.42] but I'm pretty sure
[9512.42 → 9513.20] AJ's watching.
[9513.42 → 9514.48] Yeah, AJ's in the chat,
[9514.58 → 9515.60] so maybe AJ remembers
[9515.60 → 9516.40] because I'm pretty sure
[9516.40 → 9517.40] that AJ did it
[9517.40 → 9518.70] and Luke just supervised.
[9518.90 → 9519.30] Probably.
[9519.56 → 9521.02] That was a long time ago.
[9521.42 → 9522.28] That was when AJ
[9522.28 → 9523.28] was doing literally
[9523.28 → 9524.42] all of our infrastructure.
[9525.68 → 9526.08] Yeah.
[9527.02 → 9527.52] I mean,
[9527.64 → 9528.90] he did that for a long time.
[9529.08 → 9529.78] Yeah, that's...
[9529.78 → 9529.90] Yeah.
[9532.48 → 9532.88] Look,
[9532.94 → 9533.78] I was trying to make us
[9533.78 → 9534.80] sound like a real company,
[9534.92 → 9535.06] Luke.
[9535.94 → 9536.30] Yeah.
[9536.66 → 9537.18] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9538.80 → 9540.28] So maybe AJ
[9540.28 → 9541.28] will get back to us
[9541.28 → 9542.10] in the float plane chat
[9542.10 → 9542.84] or maybe AJ
[9542.84 → 9543.84] doesn't have to be working
[9543.84 → 9544.26] right now
[9544.26 → 9544.84] because it's late,
[9544.98 → 9545.40] but whatever.
[9545.54 → 9546.60] Yeah, I don't 100% know
[9546.60 → 9547.26] that he's still around.
[9547.46 → 9548.46] I just think he is.
[9548.98 → 9549.20] Okay.
[9549.48 → 9550.48] It just wouldn't surprise me.
[9550.90 → 9552.34] Next up is from Kyle
[9552.34 → 9554.78] with Ring being on the outs.
[9555.00 → 9555.84] What is your recommendations
[9555.84 → 9556.74] for home security
[9556.74 → 9557.36] and surveillance?
[9558.32 → 9559.40] I'm really happy
[9559.40 → 9560.80] with my Ubiquity stuff.
[9563.20 → 9564.04] It's tough though
[9564.04 → 9564.80] because obviously
[9564.80 → 9566.00] it's easy for me to say
[9566.00 → 9566.64] when Ubiquity
[9566.64 → 9569.18] is a long time collaborator
[9569.18 → 9569.64] of ours
[9569.64 → 9570.34] and sends us
[9570.34 → 9570.98] a lot of the stuff
[9570.98 → 9571.80] that we need from them.
[9572.34 → 9573.72] It's really expensive,
[9574.04 → 9575.26] especially for home use.
[9576.18 → 9577.88] So it's tough, right?
[9577.94 → 9578.52] There was that,
[9578.60 → 9580.80] man, what was that?
[9581.04 → 9581.40] Wise.
[9581.58 → 9583.08] There was that cheap brand
[9583.08 → 9583.74] that everyone loved
[9583.74 → 9584.20] for a while
[9584.20 → 9584.86] and then they started
[9584.86 → 9585.86] locking things down
[9585.86 → 9586.80] so it like apparently
[9586.80 → 9587.36] sucks now.
[9587.46 → 9589.32] I haven't completely
[9589.32 → 9589.96] looked into it.
[9590.38 → 9591.46] We did a video
[9591.46 → 9592.88] on like a DIY solution
[9592.88 → 9593.58] back in the day.
[9593.72 → 9595.56] Jake did something up
[9595.56 → 9596.72] and it was like
[9596.72 → 9598.32] a Pi Zero
[9598.32 → 9601.12] DIY security camera thing.
[9601.24 → 9601.82] Something like that
[9601.82 → 9602.78] could obviously work.
[9604.22 → 9604.62] There's,
[9605.02 → 9606.68] yeah,
[9606.88 → 9608.48] I don't know.
[9608.54 → 9609.20] Maybe this is something
[9609.20 → 9609.84] that we just need
[9609.84 → 9610.80] to really dig into
[9610.80 → 9611.40] and do a video.
[9612.82 → 9613.92] I know I'm off-topic
[9613.92 → 9615.92] but I am just so happy
[9615.92 → 9617.18] that Antarctic guy
[9617.18 → 9618.02] is still subscribed.
[9618.38 → 9619.66] That's actually so sick.
[9620.18 → 9620.92] Well, you don't actually
[9620.92 → 9621.50] know that.
[9622.14 → 9622.62] That's fair.
[9623.24 → 9624.40] Antarctica guy
[9624.40 → 9625.08] is not actually
[9625.08 → 9625.98] in the float plane chat.
[9626.04 → 9626.88] That was a merge message.
[9626.88 → 9627.34] Which, yes.
[9627.84 → 9628.30] So maybe not.
[9628.32 → 9629.08] I was still around
[9629.08 → 9630.00] in some way.
[9630.16 → 9630.46] Okay.
[9630.80 → 9631.56] AJ says,
[9631.66 → 9632.72] we had a VM
[9632.72 → 9634.00] with a specific host
[9634.00 → 9634.60] at the time
[9634.60 → 9635.74] where we did pretty much
[9635.74 → 9636.98] all our CDN things.
[9637.06 → 9638.14] Okay, that's a really
[9638.14 → 9639.98] vague post explanation.
[9640.20 → 9640.98] Thank you for that, AJ.
[9643.34 → 9644.60] It was a server.
[9644.94 → 9645.96] Probably we just put
[9645.96 → 9646.92] an edge node closer
[9646.92 → 9647.54] on a route
[9647.54 → 9648.68] that was good
[9648.68 → 9649.32] for getting there.
[9650.00 → 9650.40] Probably.
[9651.04 → 9652.98] Thanks, Captain Probably.
[9654.30 → 9655.60] I asked Captain
[9655.60 → 9656.52] actually knows.
[9656.52 → 9658.02] I'm sorry it's late.
[9658.56 → 9659.34] That's fair.
[9660.24 → 9660.38] Go.
[9660.90 → 9661.94] Yeah, it's what it is.
[9662.06 → 9663.12] Go to bed.
[9663.50 → 9664.20] Exactly that.
[9664.34 → 9664.72] Yeah, okay.
[9664.90 → 9665.86] Yeah, so it's what I said.
[9666.02 → 9667.38] I was like 99% sure
[9667.38 → 9667.98] from the beginning
[9667.98 → 9669.68] but I didn't know 100%
[9669.68 → 9670.50] because it's been
[9670.50 → 9671.58] a bazillion years.
[9672.14 → 9673.28] We're not shipping anything
[9673.28 → 9674.16] to Antarctica, Jaden.
[9675.04 → 9676.12] All right, Dan, hit me.
[9677.92 → 9678.86] Speaking of shipping,
[9679.20 → 9680.12] this one's from Cody.
[9680.56 → 9681.58] What type of food
[9681.58 → 9682.22] would you sell
[9682.22 → 9683.20] on LDT Store
[9683.20 → 9684.72] if shipping food internationally
[9684.72 → 9686.18] wasn't a terrible idea?
[9687.50 → 9688.54] CBD gummies.
[9688.78 → 9689.76] There's great margin.
[9690.58 → 9690.92] Is there?
[9691.00 → 9691.24] Probably.
[9691.38 → 9692.16] Yeah, I actually had
[9692.16 → 9693.20] a former colleague
[9693.20 → 9693.92] from NCI
[9693.92 → 9695.98] who wanted to start up
[9695.98 → 9697.04] like a partnership
[9697.04 → 9699.20] doing like alertness
[9699.20 → 9700.72] gamer CBD gummies
[9700.72 → 9701.54] and stuff like that
[9701.54 → 9702.28] and they sent me
[9702.28 → 9702.98] over some of the products.
[9703.06 → 9703.58] Actually, like,
[9704.04 → 9704.90] seemed perfect.
[9705.10 → 9706.08] I actually really liked it.
[9706.14 → 9706.68] The sleep one
[9706.68 → 9707.30] was not bad.
[9707.94 → 9709.12] Not a perfect solution.
[9709.12 → 9710.68] I still do struggle
[9710.68 → 9711.58] to sleep sometimes
[9711.58 → 9712.92] but definitely better
[9712.92 → 9713.40] than nothing
[9713.40 → 9714.06] which is about all
[9714.06 → 9714.96] you can really ask for
[9714.96 → 9715.64] when it comes to
[9715.64 → 9716.80] like supplements and stuff.
[9716.92 → 9717.48] I don't know if there's
[9717.48 → 9718.92] just like a lot of margin
[9718.92 → 9720.42] in it or what's going on
[9720.42 → 9721.22] but it seems like
[9721.22 → 9722.36] every single
[9722.36 → 9723.70] like fitness
[9723.70 → 9725.08] influencer person
[9725.08 → 9725.90] sells their own
[9725.90 → 9726.58] protein powder.
[9727.28 → 9727.90] Yeah, good margin.
[9728.00 → 9728.32] That's it.
[9728.76 → 9729.66] Because it's like
[9729.66 → 9730.54] nothing.
[9730.92 → 9731.14] It's what?
[9731.24 → 9732.78] Like ground up snail shells
[9732.78 → 9733.44] or whatever, right?
[9733.44 → 9734.28] Like it's worthless.
[9734.50 → 9735.28] It's way, yeah,
[9735.34 → 9735.82] it's just way.
[9736.02 → 9736.22] Yeah.
[9737.12 → 9737.68] I know.
[9738.94 → 9739.76] Oh, I thought you were
[9739.76 → 9741.14] legitimately correcting me
[9741.14 → 9741.64] because you thought
[9741.64 → 9742.34] I thought that it was
[9742.34 → 9743.04] actually made of that.
[9743.44 → 9744.70] I love how you mix,
[9744.84 → 9745.94] you pour it into milk
[9745.94 → 9746.60] so you're just pouring
[9746.60 → 9747.44] like a milk,
[9748.08 → 9749.84] like a part of milk
[9749.84 → 9751.20] into more actual milk
[9751.20 → 9751.98] and then you drink that.
[9752.30 → 9752.78] Yeah, so.
[9753.30 → 9754.18] You're drinking like
[9754.18 → 9754.78] hyper milk.
[9755.96 → 9757.28] More milk per milk.
[9757.46 → 9757.72] Yeah.
[9759.02 → 9759.84] That's basically
[9759.84 → 9760.62] what's happening.
[9760.62 → 9761.64] Or energy powder.
[9761.72 → 9762.46] Yeah, they all have
[9762.46 → 9763.00] their own like
[9763.00 → 9764.08] pre-workout
[9764.08 → 9765.08] creatine
[9765.08 → 9767.36] protein powder,
[9767.48 → 9767.62] whatever.
[9767.76 → 9768.30] They all have their own
[9768.30 → 9769.80] like range of supplement stuff.
[9770.00 → 9770.94] It's because you can
[9770.94 → 9771.88] just find an OEM
[9771.88 → 9772.74] that makes it
[9772.74 → 9774.52] just slap a label on it
[9774.52 → 9775.58] and it's the simplest thing ever.
[9775.72 → 9776.92] And so he had a relationship
[9776.92 → 9777.84] that he was forging
[9777.84 → 9779.20] with like a big manufacturer
[9779.20 → 9780.62] of CBD gummies
[9780.62 → 9781.50] and he was like,
[9781.58 → 9782.36] you know, go for it.
[9782.38 → 9782.84] If it's good enough
[9782.84 → 9783.44] for Martha Stewart,
[9783.52 → 9784.28] it's good enough for you.
[9784.68 → 9785.12] You probably,
[9785.36 → 9786.32] based on what I just said,
[9786.36 → 9787.46] probably know who this was.
[9787.60 → 9788.00] I knew it was
[9788.00 → 9788.42] from the beginning.
[9788.42 → 9788.94] Oh, okay.
[9788.94 → 9789.62] Yeah, fair enough.
[9790.08 → 9791.70] But my hesitations
[9791.70 → 9792.70] were twofold.
[9793.44 → 9793.58] You know,
[9793.58 → 9795.68] one was I had a lot
[9795.68 → 9796.90] of concern about,
[9797.06 → 9799.10] even if I don't give
[9799.10 → 9799.86] a rat's pa toot
[9799.86 → 9801.24] about CBD
[9801.24 → 9802.00] or weed
[9802.00 → 9802.56] or whatever,
[9803.60 → 9804.58] there's a lot of uptight
[9804.58 → 9805.50] people out there
[9805.50 → 9807.54] and it's one of those spaces
[9807.54 → 9809.54] that as a loosely
[9809.54 → 9811.36] regulated industry,
[9811.36 → 9812.84] there's just a lot
[9812.84 → 9814.34] of like crap
[9814.34 → 9815.02] going on.
[9815.08 → 9815.98] A lot of shady stuff,
[9816.04 → 9817.00] a lot of shady people
[9817.00 → 9817.64] are involved
[9817.64 → 9818.60] and I just,
[9818.72 → 9819.24] I don't need
[9819.24 → 9819.94] the association.
[9819.94 → 9821.50] number two
[9821.50 → 9823.40] is I've always
[9823.40 → 9824.90] been extremely
[9824.90 → 9825.46] hesitant
[9825.46 → 9826.54] about anything
[9826.54 → 9827.74] that people ingest.
[9828.36 → 9828.60] Yeah.
[9829.22 → 9830.04] I thought,
[9830.34 → 9831.20] frankly speaking,
[9831.40 → 9832.44] I thought Mr. Beast
[9832.44 → 9833.46] was absolutely
[9833.46 → 9834.76] batshit crazy
[9834.76 → 9835.76] to do Beast Burger.
[9836.14 → 9836.32] Yeah,
[9836.42 → 9836.80] and then he did
[9836.80 → 9837.66] the chocolate stuff too.
[9837.76 → 9838.68] These like random,
[9839.00 → 9839.22] well,
[9839.32 → 9840.02] the chocolate one
[9840.02 → 9841.24] I don't even mind as much
[9841.24 → 9841.72] because at least
[9841.72 → 9842.46] it's coming from
[9842.46 → 9843.48] presumably some kind
[9843.48 → 9843.94] of factory
[9843.94 → 9844.74] that actually has
[9844.74 → 9845.68] some kind of actual
[9845.68 → 9847.42] safety protocols in place.
[9847.52 → 9847.92] But all these ghost kitchens.
[9847.92 → 9848.94] But all these like random
[9848.94 → 9849.80] ghost kitchens
[9849.80 → 9851.66] with like Lord only knows
[9851.66 → 9852.54] how long these things
[9852.54 → 9853.68] are sitting on a warmer
[9853.68 → 9854.62] before they get delivered.
[9854.78 → 9856.20] I don't know.
[9856.56 → 9857.20] I promise you
[9857.20 → 9857.94] he doesn't know.
[9858.18 → 9858.34] Yeah.
[9858.44 → 9859.44] And it only takes
[9859.44 → 9859.88] as far,
[9860.00 → 9860.78] depending on how
[9860.78 → 9861.76] your company is set up,
[9861.78 → 9862.90] it only takes one person
[9862.90 → 9864.42] to like f***ING die
[9864.42 → 9865.90] for the whole thing
[9865.90 → 9866.90] to come crumbling down.
[9867.06 → 9868.78] So anything that people ingest,
[9869.32 → 9869.90] I've just,
[9870.06 → 9871.62] I've just been
[9871.62 → 9874.26] very sketched out by.
[9874.34 → 9875.20] It's possible we'll do
[9875.20 → 9876.06] like gamer snacks
[9876.06 → 9877.00] or something at some point,
[9877.00 → 9879.48] but it just hasn't,
[9879.48 → 9880.28] hasn't happened.
[9881.92 → 9882.36] Yeah.
[9884.98 → 9885.42] Okay.
[9885.56 → 9886.66] I've got another one here
[9886.66 → 9888.40] from Joshua Linus.
[9888.62 → 9890.20] Has your wife vetoed
[9890.20 → 9891.70] any ideas or purchases
[9891.70 → 9893.16] you still want to make?
[9893.22 → 9893.66] If so,
[9893.76 → 9894.32] what were they?
[9898.86 → 9900.30] She's pretty permissive overall.
[9900.30 → 9900.82] I was going to say,
[9901.30 → 9902.88] doesn't really do that that much.
[9902.88 → 9903.02] Yeah,
[9903.02 → 9903.56] like we had this,
[9903.68 → 9905.10] we had a concept a while back
[9905.10 → 9905.88] where we were going to buy.
[9905.88 → 9908.50] We were going to buy a sex doll
[9908.50 → 9909.94] for like a Channel Super Fun
[9909.94 → 9910.40] or something.
[9910.58 → 9911.78] It was like $12,000
[9911.78 → 9912.84] or something like that.
[9912.86 → 9913.44] Well, yeah,
[9913.48 → 9914.28] that's why we didn't do it
[9914.28 → 9915.24] because we found out the price.
[9915.38 → 9915.74] Oh, okay.
[9915.80 → 9917.06] But she wasn't the obstacle.
[9917.34 → 9917.84] Like she's,
[9917.94 → 9918.42] yeah,
[9918.48 → 9919.80] she's pretty chill.
[9920.16 → 9920.78] Like she's,
[9921.06 → 9921.26] okay,
[9921.32 → 9922.24] what's great about Yvonne
[9922.24 → 9923.36] is that she,
[9923.36 → 9924.86] she lets you buy sex dolls?
[9925.38 → 9925.98] I mean,
[9925.98 → 9927.38] it's pretty reasonably priced.
[9927.42 → 9928.04] Is that not great?
[9928.24 → 9929.06] At that price,
[9929.16 → 9929.96] they're very realistic.
[9930.68 → 9931.38] I bet.
[9931.68 → 9932.16] So I've heard.
[9932.36 → 9932.44] Yeah.
[9934.62 → 9935.76] So she's,
[9935.84 → 9936.36] she's,
[9936.44 → 9937.42] she's a great
[9937.42 → 9939.06] enable.
[9939.44 → 9939.60] Yeah.
[9939.86 → 9940.10] Yeah.
[9940.16 → 9940.54] She,
[9940.84 → 9941.44] she will,
[9941.70 → 9943.06] she will try to talk you down
[9943.06 → 9943.82] off of the branch,
[9943.82 → 9945.66] but if you insist on
[9945.66 → 9947.04] climbing more
[9947.04 → 9947.60] or jumping
[9947.60 → 9948.80] or swinging from it
[9948.80 → 9950.24] or doing whatever stupid thing it is,
[9950.36 → 9951.10] she'll try to help you do it
[9951.10 → 9952.60] the best way to make sure you don't get hurt.
[9952.72 → 9952.84] Right.
[9954.10 → 9954.66] That's her.
[9954.80 → 9955.58] That's her thing.
[9958.10 → 9958.50] Um,
[9959.08 → 9959.32] yeah.
[9959.34 → 9960.26] So I can't think of anything
[9960.26 → 9961.30] that she's really
[9961.30 → 9963.44] vetoed.
[9963.50 → 9964.94] I think she could go back in time.
[9965.02 → 9966.36] She would veto the smart light switches,
[9966.36 → 9968.02] but other than that,
[9968.02 → 9969.80] we don't disagree about that much.
[9970.12 → 9970.38] Yeah.
[9971.42 → 9971.70] All right.
[9971.72 → 9972.02] Hit me.
[9972.86 → 9973.26] Okay.
[9973.28 → 9974.34] Next one's up from Michael.
[9974.58 → 9977.24] My friends and I use the dollar per hour ratio
[9977.24 → 9978.68] to judge game value.
[9978.86 → 9980.42] You've both spoken about
[9980.42 → 9981.46] how you don't care
[9981.46 → 9983.50] for MTX or cosmetics.
[9984.00 → 9984.92] One of our group
[9984.92 → 9985.60] has spent
[9985.60 → 9988.44] 2,400 US dollars
[9988.44 → 9989.24] in Fortnite,
[9989.62 → 9990.00] but
[9990.00 → 9992.16] with 5,000 hours.
[9992.50 → 9993.04] Thoughts?
[9993.42 → 9994.84] I have lots of thoughts.
[9998.72 → 10000.50] 5,000 hours in Fortnite.
[10001.38 → 10001.64] Yeah,
[10001.70 → 10002.96] that was where I went first.
[10003.62 → 10004.28] Is that,
[10004.32 → 10005.38] is that in game
[10005.38 → 10006.62] or does that include menus?
[10007.08 → 10007.32] I mean,
[10007.34 → 10008.66] it would include menus, probably.
[10009.54 → 10010.24] Some games don't.
[10010.80 → 10011.00] Oh,
[10011.14 → 10011.42] okay.
[10012.30 → 10013.04] Most games do,
[10013.12 → 10014.86] but this isn't like a Steam tracked game,
[10015.12 → 10015.38] right?
[10015.60 → 10016.76] Steam counts menus,
[10016.84 → 10017.22] I know that.
[10017.44 → 10017.82] Yeah.
[10022.32 → 10022.72] Woof.
[10028.30 → 10029.62] That's a lot of hours
[10029.62 → 10030.92] in Fortnite.
[10030.92 → 10032.88] we're still on that.
[10034.30 → 10035.74] That's also just a lot of money.
[10036.06 → 10036.30] What is,
[10036.34 → 10036.66] that's,
[10036.80 → 10037.60] is that?
[10037.60 → 10037.62] Yeah,
[10037.62 → 10039.10] you didn't have to spend that money.
[10039.26 → 10040.62] You could have also
[10040.62 → 10042.80] gotten 5,000 hours in Fortnite
[10042.80 → 10045.56] and not spent that money.
[10045.96 → 10046.48] And then,
[10046.70 → 10048.16] the dollar per hour ratio
[10048.16 → 10049.32] would be even lower,
[10049.42 → 10050.48] which would be even better.
[10050.76 → 10051.08] I am,
[10051.10 → 10052.24] I am down with
[10052.24 → 10053.32] supporting things
[10053.32 → 10054.06] that you use a lot.
[10054.12 → 10054.24] Like,
[10054.26 → 10054.50] I remember,
[10054.76 → 10055.50] I got Rocket,
[10055.58 → 10056.16] I've told this
[10056.16 → 10057.12] on the show before,
[10057.26 → 10057.98] I got Rocket League
[10057.98 → 10059.00] on some crazy sale
[10059.00 → 10059.76] for like three bucks
[10059.76 → 10060.22] or something.
[10060.58 → 10061.36] And then I've just
[10061.36 → 10062.40] played the heck out of it.
[10062.72 → 10063.48] So I bought a couple
[10063.48 → 10064.78] seasons passes or something.
[10064.88 → 10065.18] Yeah.
[10065.30 → 10066.96] I'm sure my total in on that,
[10067.60 → 10068.80] not that much.
[10069.00 → 10070.38] Probably like less than 50 bucks.
[10070.52 → 10070.72] Okay.
[10070.88 → 10071.88] And I played a ton of it.
[10071.94 → 10073.40] Let's talk about World of Warcraft.
[10073.70 → 10073.98] Okay.
[10074.14 → 10075.18] You've probably spent
[10075.18 → 10076.78] more than $2,400 on WoW.
[10080.68 → 10082.96] It was like 50 bucks a month
[10082.96 → 10083.48] back in the day,
[10083.52 → 10084.22] if I recall correctly.
[10084.48 → 10084.90] Wasn't it?
[10085.02 → 10085.26] Oh no,
[10085.32 → 10086.60] it was 50 bucks to buy the thing.
[10087.02 → 10087.28] Okay,
[10087.28 → 10088.60] with all the expansions though,
[10088.64 → 10089.14] are you sure?
[10089.56 → 10091.40] It's 15 for a month.
[10091.40 → 10091.58] 15 a month.
[10091.78 → 10092.02] Okay.
[10092.10 → 10094.22] So that's almost $200 a year.
[10095.68 → 10096.74] I bet you're close.
[10097.50 → 10098.92] To 5,000?
[10098.96 → 10099.08] No,
[10099.10 → 10099.20] no,
[10099.26 → 10099.92] 2.4.
[10100.22 → 10100.52] Oh.
[10101.82 → 10102.80] 15 times.
[10104.02 → 10105.10] Let's say that.
[10105.42 → 10106.66] Let he who is without sin
[10106.66 → 10107.88] cast the first stone here,
[10107.96 → 10108.10] sir.
[10109.26 → 10110.14] I promise you,
[10110.24 → 10112.04] I have never spent $2,000 on a
[10112.10 → 10112.32] oh,
[10112.44 → 10112.66] wait,
[10112.72 → 10112.98] hold on.
[10113.04 → 10114.00] How much did I spend on Star Citizen?
[10114.12 → 10114.32] No,
[10114.44 → 10116.72] I have never spent $2,000 on a video game.
[10116.72 → 10117.18] You have committed to though.
[10117.96 → 10118.32] Yeah.
[10118.52 → 10119.82] If it actually ever comes out,
[10119.90 → 10120.74] you're going to have a big bill.
[10120.94 → 10121.28] Okay,
[10121.34 → 10121.80] that's true.
[10123.16 → 10125.08] For a ship that is hopefully good.
[10125.28 → 10125.60] Who knows?
[10125.64 → 10125.82] Yeah,
[10125.88 → 10126.42] I guess we'll see.
[10128.54 → 10128.90] Okay,
[10128.96 → 10129.54] but one of the things,
[10129.74 → 10131.28] my brother and I shared an account
[10131.28 → 10132.42] for like literally
[10132.42 → 10134.58] the majority of the time
[10134.58 → 10135.22] that I played the game.
[10136.28 → 10136.64] Okay.
[10136.64 → 10137.98] And then another significant portion
[10137.98 → 10138.60] of me playing the game
[10138.60 → 10140.04] was definitely private servers,
[10140.28 → 10141.34] which you don't pay for monthly.
[10141.52 → 10141.92] I see.
[10141.92 → 10144.74] I just think,
[10144.84 → 10146.74] I think you're not that far off, probably.
[10147.20 → 10148.42] 15 times 12 is 180.
[10149.00 → 10149.38] Yeah.
[10149.68 → 10151.68] So let's say I played for four years.
[10151.88 → 10152.38] Is that it?
[10152.96 → 10153.50] I don't know.
[10153.72 → 10154.22] Because I played,
[10154.28 → 10155.52] because I thought you played for a long time.
[10155.60 → 10156.00] Classic.
[10156.30 → 10156.56] Yeah.
[10156.56 → 10159.06] I played like three quarters of,
[10159.14 → 10160.48] I never played consistently.
[10160.66 → 10162.14] I played three quarters of Classic.
[10162.38 → 10164.68] I played like half to three quarters
[10164.68 → 10165.46] of Burning Crusade.
[10165.60 → 10167.60] I played one quarter of Wrath.
[10167.74 → 10168.06] Okay.
[10168.18 → 10169.90] And then I never played consistently again
[10169.90 → 10171.00] until Classic came out again.
[10171.72 → 10173.46] But I am pretty sure
[10173.46 → 10175.72] I got like almost every expansion,
[10176.28 → 10176.72] but I never,
[10176.84 → 10178.26] I very rarely got them right away.
[10178.38 → 10179.56] I would get them when they were like
[10179.56 → 10180.50] basically free
[10180.50 → 10181.88] right before the next one came out.
[10181.88 → 10182.16] Sure.
[10182.16 → 10186.88] We get it.
[10186.98 → 10187.62] You're a cheapskate.
[10188.18 → 10188.32] Yeah.
[10188.46 → 10189.36] But my point stands.
[10190.50 → 10191.40] When you compare,
[10191.74 → 10192.26] I've spent a bunch on games.
[10192.38 → 10192.50] Yeah.
[10192.54 → 10194.08] When you compare this ratio
[10194.08 → 10195.30] to something like a WoW,
[10195.38 → 10196.96] does it actually seem that outlandish?
[10200.90 → 10201.58] I don't know.
[10202.58 → 10204.24] I think it depends on how much you play each month.
[10204.54 → 10205.52] Subscription model game.
[10206.04 → 10207.76] Does it need to be a subscription model game
[10207.76 → 10208.80] for the amount of content you get
[10208.80 → 10210.40] versus the content cycling
[10210.40 → 10211.98] that Fortnite does go through?
[10212.16 → 10212.30] Yeah.
[10212.30 → 10214.76] They do innovate a lot.
[10214.76 → 10216.18] They do big map changes.
[10216.38 → 10217.34] They do things like,
[10217.52 → 10217.84] I mean,
[10217.86 → 10219.48] I'm not necessarily interested in it,
[10219.58 → 10221.44] but you can turn into like the Hulk or something.
[10221.52 → 10221.96] I don't remember.
[10222.12 → 10222.54] I don't know.
[10222.54 → 10222.86] Who cares?
[10223.26 → 10223.46] Yeah.
[10223.52 → 10224.96] You can turn into like Ariana Grande,
[10225.14 → 10225.46] I think.
[10225.70 → 10225.92] Sure.
[10226.06 → 10226.34] Yeah.
[10226.44 → 10227.36] I have no idea.
[10228.84 → 10229.20] So,
[10229.34 → 10229.56] yeah,
[10229.62 → 10230.12] I don't know.
[10237.54 → 10239.58] It doesn't seem right to me.
[10240.68 → 10241.04] Okay.
[10241.04 → 10242.34] But if the math's there
[10242.34 → 10243.06] and they're fulfilled,
[10243.28 → 10243.54] like,
[10243.64 → 10245.04] I don't really care what they do
[10245.04 → 10246.40] with their own personal money.
[10246.84 → 10247.68] You can do whatever you want.
[10249.36 → 10250.04] All right.
[10250.12 → 10250.50] Okay.
[10251.92 → 10252.48] All right,
[10252.52 → 10252.70] Dan,
[10252.74 → 10253.04] hit us.
[10254.14 → 10254.62] Okay.
[10255.02 → 10256.78] Next up is from Christopher.
[10257.44 → 10258.14] Honest question.
[10258.52 → 10260.56] What is the goal of right to repair?
[10260.56 → 10262.62] I have been buying replacement parts
[10262.62 → 10263.98] and repairing my electronics
[10263.98 → 10267.94] since I broke an iPhone 3G ages ago.
[10268.58 → 10270.74] Have I not had the right to repair?
[10271.84 → 10273.48] I don't really understand your question.
[10273.62 → 10273.84] What?
[10273.84 → 10277.12] The goal of right to repair
[10277.12 → 10281.98] is that the ability to repair your device
[10281.98 → 10283.62] is a right
[10283.62 → 10288.40] and more so that your ability to do that,
[10288.48 → 10290.08] your right to repair it,
[10290.14 → 10293.22] cannot be impeded by other parties.
[10293.22 → 10296.48] So the fact that you have been able
[10296.48 → 10298.70] to get replacement parts for your electronics
[10298.70 → 10301.30] since you broke your iPhone 3G ages ago
[10301.30 → 10305.14] is not for their lack of trying
[10305.14 → 10306.80] to make those replacement parts
[10306.80 → 10309.54] impossible or inordinately expensive to get.
[10309.90 → 10311.42] You've been lucky
[10311.42 → 10312.54] and you should be thankful
[10312.54 → 10314.28] to the right to repair advocates
[10314.28 → 10315.80] and crusaders that are out there
[10315.80 → 10317.30] pushing for this
[10317.30 → 10319.26] because without them,
[10319.64 → 10321.26] no, companies like Apple
[10321.26 → 10323.26] would absolutely restrict your ability
[10323.26 → 10324.72] to get any of that stuff.
[10325.18 → 10326.88] They would want you to come to them
[10326.88 → 10327.88] for first-party repairs
[10327.88 → 10329.96] or they would want to sell you a new device.
[10330.52 → 10333.88] So right to repair is what you're talking about
[10333.88 → 10336.34] except it is establishing it as a right.
[10336.46 → 10339.14] It's establishing that you actually have ownership
[10339.14 → 10340.54] of the things that you have bought
[10340.54 → 10342.16] and that they are, no, not in fact,
[10342.48 → 10344.10] still the property of the company
[10344.10 → 10345.04] that produced them.
[10345.04 → 10347.82] If you do not,
[10347.82 → 10351.14] if you do not sort of,
[10352.02 → 10356.60] if right to repair is not a priority for you
[10356.60 → 10358.72] or you don't think that it's important,
[10359.08 → 10360.58] you do not understand it.
[10361.10 → 10363.98] It really is very black and white.
[10364.20 → 10368.22] There's not any room for negotiation
[10368.22 → 10369.84] or nuance on this.
[10369.84 → 10375.86] The solutions for how we enforce
[10375.86 → 10378.64] the consumer's right to repair,
[10379.14 → 10381.66] well, that's where there's room for discussion.
[10382.16 → 10384.80] But the actual right to repair,
[10384.96 → 10387.06] to own devices that you pay for,
[10387.56 → 10389.32] that's not negotiable.
[10389.50 → 10390.34] And if you disagree,
[10390.50 → 10392.36] then you're just wrong, unfortunately.
[10392.36 → 10394.56] And you need to educate yourself
[10394.56 → 10397.14] because the people who do disagree
[10397.14 → 10400.20] will put up all kinds of just,
[10400.86 → 10402.78] frankly, ridiculous arguments.
[10403.12 → 10405.24] Like, well, what if I don't want to?
[10405.30 → 10406.40] What if I want Apple to repair?
[10406.46 → 10408.20] Then by all means, go do it.
[10409.14 → 10411.42] The right for someone else
[10411.42 → 10412.90] to repair a device themselves
[10412.90 → 10415.44] does not infringe upon your right
[10415.44 → 10416.84] to pay someone too much money
[10416.84 → 10417.64] for them to do it.
[10417.94 → 10419.58] Or even a reasonable amount of money
[10419.58 → 10420.20] for them to do it.
[10420.20 → 10421.46] I mean, everyone has different priorities.
[10421.56 → 10422.64] Not everybody wants to tinker
[10422.64 → 10423.60] with their stupid phone.
[10423.74 → 10424.44] I get it.
[10424.80 → 10426.40] But just because you don't
[10426.40 → 10427.82] means you need to sit down,
[10428.34 → 10429.26] shut your mouth,
[10429.60 → 10432.44] and let everyone else do their thing.
[10432.72 → 10433.26] That's all.
[10433.96 → 10434.86] Very simple.
[10437.94 → 10438.66] All right.
[10439.02 → 10439.38] Okay.
[10439.80 → 10442.34] Up next, we have Kyler.
[10442.90 → 10443.60] Over the years,
[10443.66 → 10445.40] we've seen tech have the infamous
[10445.40 → 10447.10] planned obsolescence.
[10447.58 → 10448.52] What tech equipment
[10448.52 → 10450.04] would you say has no excuse
[10450.04 → 10451.02] to be going bad
[10451.02 → 10452.86] in only a handful of years?
[10456.16 → 10457.74] I'm exhausted of phones.
[10458.14 → 10458.80] Just, like,
[10458.94 → 10460.84] turning into complete suck.
[10461.60 → 10462.14] I mean,
[10462.18 → 10463.64] I'm pretty sure that my dad,
[10463.70 → 10464.60] when I was growing up,
[10464.64 → 10465.70] had his rotary phone
[10465.70 → 10466.80] for, like, 20 years.
[10467.94 → 10468.42] I mean,
[10468.44 → 10468.96] it was, like,
[10469.10 → 10469.78] yellowed enough.
[10469.94 → 10471.12] Like, the plastics were...
[10471.12 → 10471.80] But it still worked.
[10471.92 → 10472.28] But yeah,
[10472.34 → 10473.36] but everything still worked.
[10473.40 → 10473.92] I mean, yeah,
[10473.98 → 10474.78] it's, um...
[10474.78 → 10476.18] I hate the disability
[10476.18 → 10476.88] of these things.
[10477.00 → 10477.92] I think about this
[10477.92 → 10478.90] when I get rid of
[10478.90 → 10480.76] certain things, actually.
[10480.84 → 10481.46] Because if there's, like,
[10481.48 → 10482.22] a new shiny thing
[10482.22 → 10482.68] on the market
[10482.68 → 10483.76] that I want,
[10484.28 → 10484.86] and I'm replacing
[10484.86 → 10485.92] something that I have...
[10485.92 → 10486.58] Yes, everyone's gonna
[10486.58 → 10487.04] call me cheap.
[10488.52 → 10489.78] I think about, like,
[10489.80 → 10490.54] the amount of issues
[10490.54 → 10491.94] that I might have with it,
[10492.18 → 10493.02] with the new thing,
[10493.28 → 10494.20] as it gets into
[10494.20 → 10495.66] its obsolescent period,
[10495.86 → 10497.34] its planned obsolescent period.
[10497.70 → 10498.18] And I'm like,
[10498.32 → 10498.84] ooh,
[10498.84 → 10499.66] the thing that I have
[10499.66 → 10500.48] right now works.
[10500.62 → 10501.40] Do I want to just
[10501.40 → 10502.22] keep that?
[10503.04 → 10503.36] Maybe.
[10504.90 → 10505.22] Depends.
[10505.36 → 10506.12] Depends on the thing.
[10506.70 → 10507.86] Depends on how impacted it is.
[10508.04 → 10508.32] Phones,
[10509.46 → 10511.10] it gets a little bit too painful.
[10511.78 → 10512.60] You kinda gotta move on.
[10513.34 → 10514.36] Batteries aren't replaceable.
[10514.64 → 10515.52] Your battery running
[10515.52 → 10516.46] out of total capacity
[10516.46 → 10517.80] gets really, really frustrating.
[10518.00 → 10518.10] Yeah.
[10518.20 → 10519.62] Certain apps aren't gonna work as well.
[10519.70 → 10520.70] You run out of software updates,
[10520.78 → 10521.16] stuff like that.
[10521.18 → 10521.78] You kinda gotta do it
[10521.78 → 10522.34] at a certain degree.
[10522.54 → 10523.32] I've been running on this one
[10523.32 → 10523.88] for a while.
[10524.06 → 10525.10] It's still fine right now,
[10525.10 → 10526.10] but it'll run out of its...
[10526.78 → 10528.24] I'm going to go with earphones.
[10529.72 → 10531.26] Audio devices are something
[10531.26 → 10532.44] that for decades
[10532.44 → 10533.82] we've been able to count on
[10533.82 → 10535.78] to be pretty decent
[10535.78 → 10537.52] 10 years after you bought them
[10537.52 → 10538.54] as long as you invested
[10538.54 → 10539.22] in a good one,
[10539.30 → 10540.36] like a good quality one.
[10540.68 → 10541.48] Whereas now,
[10541.62 → 10543.02] you buy a pair of earphones
[10543.02 → 10543.92] with the expectation
[10543.92 → 10545.18] that in three to five years
[10545.18 → 10546.28] it will be actual e-waste.
[10546.32 → 10546.88] Do you think that's why
[10546.88 → 10547.84] the headphone jack went away?
[10548.14 → 10549.16] To make earphones
[10549.16 → 10550.32] a consumable?
[10550.56 → 10552.30] I like to not wear
[10552.30 → 10554.58] my tinfoil hat
[10554.58 → 10557.54] so loud and proud
[10557.54 → 10558.14] as all that,
[10558.14 → 10560.56] but I mean,
[10560.68 → 10562.40] I don't know.
[10562.50 → 10563.42] Sometimes I can't tell
[10563.42 → 10563.96] the difference
[10563.96 → 10565.46] between 4D chess
[10565.46 → 10570.00] and just design first.
[10570.50 → 10570.96] Like I just,
[10571.06 → 10572.06] I don't know.
[10572.30 → 10572.94] I don't know,
[10573.02 → 10573.94] but I don't know.
[10574.24 → 10574.68] Maybe.
[10576.36 → 10576.94] I mean,
[10576.98 → 10577.64] maybe buds,
[10577.78 → 10579.10] but like the kinds of headphones
[10579.10 → 10580.04] we're wearing now,
[10580.38 → 10580.80] you know,
[10580.88 → 10581.88] some of those do last
[10581.88 → 10582.40] for decades.
[10582.98 → 10583.22] Oh yeah,
[10583.28 → 10583.90] these do,
[10584.08 → 10584.50] which is like,
[10584.72 → 10584.86] yeah,
[10584.92 → 10585.74] but that's the precedent
[10585.74 → 10586.28] for it, right?
[10586.28 → 10586.98] Like I expect,
[10587.10 → 10587.28] I mean,
[10587.34 → 10588.16] these are not great.
[10588.16 → 10589.08] Maybe not these.
[10589.10 → 10589.24] Yeah,
[10589.24 → 10589.88] not these.
[10589.96 → 10591.82] These are just affordable.
[10591.92 → 10592.84] My 595s,
[10592.94 → 10593.76] I'm on,
[10594.40 → 10595.00] I don't even know
[10595.00 → 10595.50] how many times
[10595.50 → 10596.72] I've replaced the ear pads,
[10597.06 → 10597.80] but I just keep replacing
[10597.80 → 10598.32] the ear pads.
[10598.40 → 10599.32] They're fantastic headphones.
[10599.44 → 10600.50] I hope I never have
[10600.50 → 10601.12] to stop using them.
[10601.20 → 10602.70] I'm on year 15 with mine
[10602.70 → 10603.24] and I haven't even
[10603.24 → 10604.26] replaced the ear pads.
[10604.40 → 10605.48] They're like still going strong.
[10605.74 → 10605.98] Oh.
[10606.20 → 10606.40] Yeah.
[10606.78 → 10607.04] Oh.
[10608.26 → 10608.50] Okay.
[10609.24 → 10609.60] Next.
[10609.96 → 10610.60] They're leather.
[10610.78 → 10610.88] Yeah,
[10610.92 → 10611.22] whatever.
[10611.48 → 10611.76] Okay.
[10612.34 → 10612.50] Yeah,
[10612.58 → 10613.02] that's fine.
[10613.24 → 10614.48] I thought you had 595s
[10614.48 → 10615.52] because you just said mine
[10615.52 → 10616.00] and I was like,
[10616.10 → 10616.86] that's gross.
[10617.40 → 10617.84] Sorry.
[10618.00 → 10618.12] Oh,
[10618.20 → 10618.64] good God.
[10619.40 → 10619.84] Okay.
[10620.92 → 10621.36] Next,
[10621.52 → 10622.52] we've got Alex.
[10623.02 → 10623.82] Have you ever thought
[10623.82 → 10625.42] about getting into fragrances?
[10625.96 → 10626.24] Yes.
[10626.24 → 10628.04] I want to re-experience
[10628.04 → 10629.58] that new PC smell.
[10629.86 → 10633.46] I want a magic blue smoke fragrance.
[10633.88 → 10634.08] Oh,
[10634.26 → 10634.56] God,
[10634.68 → 10634.96] no.
[10636.12 → 10637.58] That gives me so much anxiety.
[10638.02 → 10638.80] If you could just
[10638.80 → 10640.20] dab a little bit of
[10640.20 → 10641.30] magic blue smoke
[10641.30 → 10641.92] on the wrist,
[10642.04 → 10642.26] man,
[10642.38 → 10642.58] just,
[10642.94 → 10643.14] ah.
[10643.86 → 10644.96] And new electronics.
[10645.18 → 10646.98] I'd love a new electronics fragrance.
[10647.22 → 10647.82] I don't want to smell
[10647.82 → 10648.64] any of these things.
[10648.82 → 10649.40] Burnt plastic.
[10649.40 → 10649.76] Yes.
[10649.88 → 10650.12] Oh,
[10650.28 → 10651.04] burnt plastic.
[10651.28 → 10651.64] Ah,
[10651.76 → 10652.34] I love it.
[10653.82 → 10654.30] Gross.
[10655.08 → 10655.30] Okay.
[10656.16 → 10656.56] Okay,
[10656.64 → 10657.54] last of the curated.
[10657.86 → 10658.80] This is from Antoine.
[10658.86 → 10659.22] What would be,
[10659.30 → 10659.44] sorry,
[10659.54 → 10659.92] one second.
[10660.16 → 10660.90] What would be funny
[10660.90 → 10662.68] is if for April Fool's events
[10662.68 → 10664.06] for LTT Store
[10664.06 → 10665.32] is if you guys
[10665.32 → 10665.66] made,
[10665.74 → 10665.90] like,
[10666.08 → 10667.08] actually made,
[10667.20 → 10667.46] like,
[10667.52 → 10668.06] joke products
[10668.06 → 10669.32] but you actually made them
[10669.32 → 10670.16] and actually shipped them
[10670.16 → 10670.56] to people.
[10675.36 → 10675.80] Luke,
[10675.82 → 10676.94] why do you enable him?
[10677.64 → 10678.68] Because it's awesome.
[10678.98 → 10679.52] Because sometimes
[10679.52 → 10680.20] he'll follow through
[10680.20 → 10680.60] with stuff
[10680.60 → 10681.52] that I think is hilarious
[10681.52 → 10682.26] and it's great.
[10683.08 → 10684.36] I'm not telling you to not.
[10686.18 → 10687.10] Because I was thinking
[10687.10 → 10687.96] the other day about,
[10688.36 → 10689.06] I haven't heard about
[10689.06 → 10690.04] Cards Against Humanity
[10690.04 → 10690.68] in a long time.
[10691.30 → 10692.28] But they used to do
[10692.28 → 10693.24] stuff like that.
[10693.70 → 10694.20] They would basically,
[10694.32 → 10694.40] like,
[10694.44 → 10695.12] troll their customers.
[10695.54 → 10695.98] But they would be
[10695.98 → 10696.90] transparent about it.
[10696.94 → 10697.28] They'd be like,
[10697.30 → 10698.16] you're buying this thing
[10698.16 → 10698.72] and people would be like,
[10698.78 → 10699.88] no way,
[10700.04 → 10700.64] there's no way
[10700.64 → 10701.70] they'd ship that to me.
[10701.94 → 10702.88] And then they actually do it.
[10703.94 → 10704.42] I just,
[10704.60 → 10705.12] I like that.
[10705.16 → 10705.34] I mean,
[10705.34 → 10706.76] Brand does that sort of thing too.
[10707.06 → 10707.28] Yeah,
[10707.44 → 10707.68] yeah,
[10707.72 → 10707.90] like,
[10708.00 → 10709.36] it's not unheard of.
[10709.36 → 10710.28] It is definitely
[10710.28 → 10711.08] actually a thing.
[10711.18 → 10712.20] It's a lot of work
[10712.20 → 10713.24] developing a product
[10713.24 → 10714.40] that's actually good.
[10714.78 → 10715.50] I don't like
[10715.50 → 10716.78] manufacturing garbage.
[10717.08 → 10717.18] Like,
[10717.22 → 10717.82] I don't like
[10717.82 → 10719.26] manufactured waste.
[10719.68 → 10720.16] So,
[10720.46 → 10721.74] I have tended
[10721.74 → 10723.16] away
[10723.16 → 10724.22] from anything
[10724.22 → 10725.20] that's just
[10725.20 → 10726.48] LOL.
[10728.60 → 10729.32] That's what,
[10729.38 → 10729.64] that's,
[10729.72 → 10730.56] that's what I will say.
[10730.64 → 10731.08] That's fair.
[10731.36 → 10731.52] Yeah,
[10731.70 → 10732.20] that is fair.
[10733.40 → 10733.64] Okay,
[10733.64 → 10734.48] last of the
[10734.48 → 10735.14] curated
[10735.14 → 10736.04] from Antoine.
[10736.04 → 10736.92] I've been watching
[10736.92 → 10738.78] the weekly news analysis,
[10739.20 → 10740.16] open parenthesis,
[10740.46 → 10740.70] lol,
[10740.86 → 10741.76] close parenthesis,
[10741.90 → 10742.94] show religiously
[10742.94 → 10744.38] for about six to seven years now.
[10744.50 → 10745.48] How do you guys deal
[10745.48 → 10746.66] with crazy people
[10746.66 → 10748.16] who know you as I do
[10748.16 → 10749.48] without having met you?
[10750.34 → 10751.18] I think we're just
[10751.18 → 10752.08] kind of used to it.
[10752.18 → 10752.30] Yeah,
[10752.30 → 10752.84] it's not that bad.
[10753.34 → 10753.60] Yeah,
[10754.08 → 10754.40] I mean,
[10754.44 → 10754.86] it's like,
[10754.92 → 10755.70] there's been times
[10755.70 → 10756.46] where it was bad,
[10756.54 → 10757.06] but they're usually
[10757.06 → 10757.96] very contained
[10757.96 → 10758.94] and you get over it.
[10759.04 → 10759.22] Yeah,
[10759.22 → 10760.96] it's overall pretty cool.
[10761.14 → 10761.26] Like,
[10761.34 → 10761.60] it's,
[10761.68 → 10764.08] it's always a nice,
[10764.24 → 10765.04] I always liked
[10765.04 → 10766.00] the status flex,
[10766.38 → 10767.16] like back when,
[10767.90 → 10768.72] back when I was
[10768.72 → 10770.84] in dating phases.
[10771.22 → 10771.92] If you're out
[10771.92 → 10772.72] on a date with someone
[10772.72 → 10773.54] and someone comes up
[10773.54 → 10774.16] to you and like,
[10774.52 → 10774.76] oh,
[10774.84 → 10776.02] it's great.
[10776.36 → 10777.28] I would always like,
[10777.44 → 10778.38] I would notice someone
[10778.38 → 10779.06] looking at me
[10779.06 → 10779.50] and be like,
[10779.60 → 10779.78] that,
[10779.88 → 10780.80] that person knows
[10780.80 → 10781.28] who I am.
[10781.42 → 10781.86] And I'd be like,
[10781.94 → 10782.36] come on.
[10782.64 → 10783.56] But is it effective?
[10784.02 → 10784.22] Yeah.
[10786.84 → 10787.68] Not as effective
[10787.68 → 10788.24] as chicken,
[10788.36 → 10788.70] apparently.
[10788.94 → 10789.34] Hey,
[10789.58 → 10790.82] they're both effective.
[10791.30 → 10791.48] Okay.
[10791.56 → 10791.66] Yeah,
[10791.68 → 10792.60] hit them with both of them.
[10793.02 → 10793.30] Yeah.
[10793.50 → 10793.90] Okay.
[10793.90 → 10794.96] You don't hit anyone
[10794.96 → 10795.52] with chicken.
[10795.52 → 10796.08] Okay.
[10796.74 → 10797.72] That's not okay,
[10797.82 → 10797.92] Dan.
[10797.92 → 10798.90] I get salmonella.
[10800.04 → 10800.44] No,
[10800.56 → 10801.06] chickened.
[10801.54 → 10802.22] I said chicken,
[10802.36 → 10802.82] not salmon.
[10803.02 → 10803.32] Yeah.
[10803.44 → 10803.80] Yeah.
[10803.92 → 10804.26] Yeah.
[10804.26 → 10804.56] Yeah.
[10804.56 → 10805.48] I'm so bad at this.
[10805.62 → 10806.02] I'm sorry.
[10808.82 → 10809.18] Okay.
[10809.64 → 10810.30] Last curated.
[10810.52 → 10810.62] Oh,
[10810.66 → 10810.74] no,
[10810.80 → 10811.16] that was it.
[10811.16 → 10811.80] That was the curated.
[10811.84 → 10812.92] We're on to the potentials.
[10812.98 → 10813.52] We're on to the potentials now.
[10814.08 → 10814.76] Do you want me to read
[10814.76 → 10815.34] the potentials
[10815.34 → 10815.90] and you can keep
[10815.90 → 10816.52] working on incoming?
[10816.64 → 10817.50] Should we just go for it?
[10817.56 → 10817.76] Yeah.
[10817.76 → 10817.84] Yeah.
[10818.12 → 10819.08] This freaks asks,
[10819.24 → 10819.48] Linus,
[10819.54 → 10820.24] can you sell things
[10820.24 → 10821.34] that are already waste?
[10821.44 → 10821.88] For example,
[10821.88 → 10822.96] the high school I went to
[10822.96 → 10824.22] demolished a couple of years ago.
[10824.26 → 10824.98] They were selling bricks
[10824.98 → 10825.44] to alumni.
[10826.00 → 10826.38] Yeah.
[10826.42 → 10827.46] That's something we actually
[10827.46 → 10829.04] do want to do more of
[10829.04 → 10830.42] is turning e-waste
[10830.42 → 10833.10] into like decorative items.
[10833.32 → 10833.66] We've been,
[10833.74 → 10833.98] man,
[10834.00 → 10835.10] it's been like over a year,
[10835.16 → 10836.08] which is sort of embarrassing,
[10836.08 → 10837.34] but we've wanted to do.
[10837.88 → 10839.52] You could do the exploded boxes.
[10839.90 → 10840.26] Yeah,
[10840.40 → 10840.72] we could.
[10840.78 → 10841.42] Those are a lot of work.
[10841.42 → 10842.66] We're trying to figure out
[10842.66 → 10843.64] things that are
[10843.64 → 10845.02] relatively scalable
[10845.02 → 10846.80] because unless you're actually
[10846.80 → 10848.48] repurposing,
[10848.66 → 10849.32] you know,
[10849.38 → 10851.14] many pounds of electronics,
[10851.64 → 10853.56] are you doing anything?
[10853.70 → 10854.20] I don't know.
[10854.28 → 10855.12] And it's all just
[10855.12 → 10855.92] delaying the inevitable
[10855.92 → 10856.82] and I understand that,
[10856.88 → 10857.82] but we're looking for
[10857.82 → 10858.72] things that are
[10858.72 → 10859.74] reasonably scalable.
[10860.04 → 10861.48] So one of the ideas we had
[10861.48 → 10863.90] is like acrylic
[10863.90 → 10866.08] or like resin coasters
[10866.08 → 10867.80] with CPUs embedded in them.
[10868.18 → 10869.12] So that's something
[10869.12 → 10870.08] we've been trying
[10870.08 → 10871.04] to perfect
[10871.04 → 10872.56] for over a year.
[10873.40 → 10874.64] Not full-time,
[10875.04 → 10875.66] obviously.
[10876.12 → 10877.42] Just been on the table.
[10877.44 → 10878.02] It's a project
[10878.02 → 10878.90] that's been kind of
[10878.90 → 10880.18] handed off
[10880.18 → 10880.94] first from,
[10881.06 → 10881.48] I think,
[10882.56 → 10884.24] who was the first person
[10884.24 → 10884.66] to touch it?
[10884.70 → 10885.66] I think Kyle might have
[10885.66 → 10886.78] done something with it
[10886.78 → 10888.32] and then Tynan was on it
[10888.32 → 10888.80] and then I think
[10888.80 → 10889.72] one of the new engineers
[10889.72 → 10890.40] who might still be
[10890.40 → 10890.96] on probation
[10890.96 → 10892.18] was on it.
[10893.28 → 10894.28] Jacob might have
[10894.28 → 10894.74] looked at it
[10894.74 → 10895.26] at some point
[10895.26 → 10895.86] when he was here.
[10895.92 → 10896.50] The point is
[10896.50 → 10897.04] a lot of people
[10897.04 → 10897.58] have kind of
[10897.58 → 10898.90] chipped away at it,
[10898.94 → 10900.24] but we haven't figured out
[10900.24 → 10901.56] exactly how to
[10901.56 → 10902.74] make sure the bottom
[10902.74 → 10903.76] doesn't end up
[10903.76 → 10904.84] concave.
[10905.24 → 10906.34] We haven't figured out
[10906.34 → 10907.18] how to make sure
[10907.18 → 10908.06] that whatever,
[10908.34 → 10908.94] like the acrylic
[10908.94 → 10909.78] that we machine our
[10909.78 → 10910.50] the spot for
[10910.50 → 10912.10] is exactly the same tone
[10912.10 → 10912.90] and fades
[10912.90 → 10914.46] in exactly the same way
[10914.46 → 10915.42] as the resin
[10915.42 → 10916.20] that we put in it.
[10916.44 → 10917.52] Getting all the bubbles
[10917.52 → 10918.08] out of the resin.
[10918.12 → 10918.56] There's actually
[10918.56 → 10919.56] a lot involved
[10919.56 → 10920.14] in just
[10920.14 → 10921.74] the stupidest
[10921.74 → 10922.38] bulls**
[10922.38 → 10922.96] sometimes,
[10923.08 → 10923.34] you know?
[10923.34 → 10925.16] Like it seems easy.
[10925.60 → 10925.74] Yeah,
[10925.78 → 10926.50] just put a CPU
[10926.50 → 10926.96] in resin,
[10927.06 → 10928.46] but what if the CPU
[10928.46 → 10929.64] goes too deep
[10929.64 → 10930.38] into the resin
[10930.38 → 10931.22] and it pokes
[10931.22 → 10931.96] through the top?
[10932.08 → 10932.32] Well,
[10932.34 → 10932.98] that doesn't look
[10932.98 → 10933.60] very nice.
[10934.40 → 10934.68] Well,
[10934.78 → 10934.98] okay,
[10934.98 → 10935.74] you could put a thing
[10935.74 → 10936.38] in there to keep it
[10936.38 → 10937.28] from going in too deep.
[10937.28 → 10937.58] How did they use to do
[10937.58 → 10938.66] the old school keychains?
[10939.38 → 10939.68] I don't know.
[10939.72 → 10940.32] Was that resin
[10940.32 → 10940.82] or was that like
[10940.82 → 10941.70] a plastic case?
[10941.78 → 10942.18] I'm not sure.
[10942.30 → 10942.72] I don't remember.
[10942.84 → 10943.46] It's a good question.
[10944.02 → 10945.00] So we'll figure it out.
[10945.66 → 10946.50] It just takes time.
[10946.50 → 10950.94] So you guys
[10950.94 → 10951.42] are on it now
[10951.42 → 10952.32] for the potentials?
[10952.32 → 10952.48] Oh,
[10952.58 → 10952.78] yeah,
[10952.78 → 10953.02] sure.
[10953.04 → 10953.12] Unless you want me
[10953.12 → 10953.58] to just start
[10953.58 → 10954.36] going through them.
[10955.22 → 10955.66] Okay,
[10955.86 → 10957.22] I can do potentials.
[10957.22 → 10957.40] Okay.
[10957.62 → 10958.30] Samuel says,
[10958.86 → 10960.06] hopefully this jacket
[10960.06 → 10961.34] is worth $250.
[10961.92 → 10962.90] My question is,
[10962.96 → 10963.78] do you guys have any thoughts
[10963.78 → 10964.66] on hydrogen fuel cell?
[10965.02 → 10966.08] I would love
[10966.08 → 10967.24] to see hydrogen fuel cell
[10967.24 → 10967.70] succeed.
[10967.84 → 10968.92] From what I can tell,
[10969.10 → 10971.46] it's far less impactful
[10971.46 → 10972.64] in terms of mining
[10972.64 → 10973.54] rare earth metals
[10973.54 → 10974.46] than what we're doing
[10974.46 → 10975.00] right now.
[10975.26 → 10976.06] With that said,
[10976.06 → 10977.40] Tesla did show off
[10977.40 → 10978.42] some very promising
[10978.42 → 10981.92] slides at their last
[10981.92 → 10983.34] tech day to do with
[10983.34 → 10984.60] reducing the
[10984.60 → 10985.82] I believe it was
[10985.82 → 10987.66] nickel and cobalt
[10987.66 → 10990.30] contents of their
[10990.30 → 10990.64] batteries.
[10990.84 → 10991.04] So,
[10991.24 → 10991.42] you know,
[10991.48 → 10991.88] who knows?
[10992.00 → 10993.32] If batteries get
[10993.32 → 10995.26] less reliant on heavy
[10995.26 → 10995.60] metals,
[10995.76 → 10997.26] if batteries get
[10997.26 → 10998.80] more recyclable,
[10998.92 → 10999.86] like if we could take
[10999.86 → 11001.04] a dead lithium battery
[11001.04 → 11001.82] and get back,
[11001.94 → 11002.50] you know,
[11002.58 → 11002.98] 80,
[11003.26 → 11004.36] 90 plus percent
[11004.36 → 11004.88] of the lithium
[11004.88 → 11005.54] and turn it back
[11005.54 → 11006.74] into a working battery,
[11006.74 → 11007.76] I'd love to see that.
[11008.56 → 11009.44] But otherwise,
[11009.70 → 11009.92] I mean,
[11009.96 → 11011.00] hydrogen fuel cell,
[11011.18 → 11012.26] aside from just being
[11012.26 → 11015.44] kind of stalled
[11015.44 → 11016.60] right now,
[11016.60 → 11017.72] in terms of at least
[11017.72 → 11018.62] what I'm seeing
[11018.62 → 11019.60] as a general consumer,
[11019.60 → 11020.50] it's not an industry
[11020.50 → 11021.72] that I follow super closely.
[11021.72 → 11026.42] I'd love for it to work.
[11026.42 → 11026.90] There.
[11027.38 → 11028.28] That's what I'll say about it.
[11028.34 → 11028.54] I just,
[11029.12 → 11030.24] there's so much momentum
[11030.24 → 11031.50] for electric charging
[11031.50 → 11032.98] now and so little
[11032.98 → 11034.30] momentum for hydrogen
[11034.30 → 11036.02] fuel cell fuelling stations.
[11036.02 → 11036.46] I just,
[11036.64 → 11038.66] I don't have a lot of hope.
[11039.74 → 11040.18] Yeah.
[11041.66 → 11042.14] Yep.
[11042.14 → 11047.78] Oh,
[11047.78 → 11047.98] right.
[11048.02 → 11049.00] I'm supposed to be doing this.
[11049.56 → 11049.98] Linus,
[11050.10 → 11051.40] seeing as you seemed
[11051.40 → 11052.36] to enjoy playing
[11052.36 → 11053.84] Horizon Call of the Mountain
[11053.84 → 11055.16] on PSVR 2,
[11055.34 → 11056.50] do you think you might
[11056.50 → 11057.70] give Horizon Zero Dawn
[11057.70 → 11058.26] another try?
[11058.32 → 11059.52] I finished Horizon Zero Dawn.
[11059.98 → 11060.16] Yeah.
[11060.24 → 11060.40] Yeah,
[11060.40 → 11061.40] I loved Horizon Zero Dawn.
[11061.62 → 11061.74] Yeah,
[11061.74 → 11062.24] it's a great game.
[11062.40 → 11062.54] Yeah,
[11062.54 → 11063.46] it's a perfect game.
[11063.62 → 11064.58] If you haven't played it,
[11064.66 → 11065.68] it's awesome.
[11066.16 → 11067.30] I played through it
[11067.30 → 11069.60] on the Steam Deck.
[11069.60 → 11071.36] The only issue I had
[11071.36 → 11072.52] was related to running it
[11072.52 → 11073.22] on the Steam Deck
[11073.22 → 11074.04] and it being in its
[11074.04 → 11075.32] very early days
[11075.32 → 11076.70] and some sort of weird
[11076.70 → 11077.88] crashing and bugginess
[11077.88 → 11078.62] and stuff like that.
[11078.68 → 11078.76] No,
[11078.80 → 11079.46] really great game.
[11079.74 → 11080.46] Really enjoyed it.
[11082.64 → 11083.76] Currently watching
[11083.76 → 11085.22] March 3rd WAN show,
[11085.48 → 11086.46] Hi Future Me.
[11087.02 → 11087.24] Oh,
[11087.40 → 11088.28] you're behind.
[11088.44 → 11088.80] I see.
[11089.54 → 11090.98] Linus and Luke and Dan,
[11091.28 → 11092.68] what has been your favourite
[11092.68 → 11095.04] date with your respective SO's?
[11095.38 → 11095.90] Why?
[11096.22 → 11097.10] And do you think
[11097.10 → 11098.56] they would pick the same?
[11098.56 → 11100.02] If you guys aren't ready,
[11100.16 → 11100.72] I can go first.
[11100.80 → 11101.62] I have something in mind,
[11101.80 → 11103.56] but okay.
[11104.58 → 11106.54] Probably the most fun date
[11106.54 → 11108.30] that Yvonne and I went on,
[11108.36 → 11110.00] at least in the last five years,
[11110.16 → 11111.52] was we did something
[11111.52 → 11112.94] called a discovery flight
[11112.94 → 11114.84] at a flight school
[11114.84 → 11116.16] at the local airfield.
[11116.66 → 11119.08] It was shockingly affordable.
[11119.20 → 11119.96] Did you guys ever do it?
[11120.16 → 11120.28] No.
[11121.30 → 11121.92] Do it.
[11122.00 → 11122.72] Way to spoil that.
[11124.00 → 11125.12] It's not like Emma watches
[11125.12 → 11125.78] the WAN show.
[11125.78 → 11126.10] Yeah,
[11126.12 → 11126.42] she does.
[11126.92 → 11127.12] Oh.
[11128.56 → 11131.54] You know what?
[11131.66 → 11131.88] No,
[11131.98 → 11132.70] I'm not accepting
[11132.70 → 11133.76] any responsibility for this.
[11133.86 → 11135.52] I told him like a year ago.
[11136.08 → 11136.48] There.
[11136.92 → 11137.14] Yeah,
[11137.20 → 11138.30] because it was my idea
[11138.30 → 11139.46] because I asked you to go.
[11139.62 → 11139.98] Was it?
[11140.10 → 11140.36] Yeah.
[11140.52 → 11140.74] Oh.
[11140.90 → 11141.94] And then you just did it
[11141.94 → 11142.74] without me.
[11144.48 → 11144.88] Okay,
[11144.96 → 11145.68] I guess we're airing
[11145.68 → 11146.74] some dirty laundry today.
[11148.70 → 11149.10] Well,
[11149.14 → 11149.94] it was a perfect idea.
[11150.16 → 11150.44] Thanks.
[11150.44 → 11152.82] So it's shockingly affordable.
[11152.98 → 11154.12] It was like $130
[11154.12 → 11155.62] or something like that.
[11155.62 → 11156.62] We're up for,
[11156.76 → 11157.82] it was like two hours
[11157.82 → 11158.88] or something all told.
[11159.00 → 11159.78] I guess technically
[11159.78 → 11160.40] I didn't ask
[11160.40 → 11160.82] if you wanted to do
[11160.82 → 11161.74] the discovery flight.
[11161.82 → 11162.00] Oh,
[11162.02 → 11162.14] okay.
[11162.14 → 11162.78] I asked if you wanted to like
[11162.78 → 11164.86] do the whole thing.
[11164.96 → 11165.16] Oh yeah,
[11165.22 → 11166.26] and I'm still down.
[11166.42 → 11167.12] I'm still down.
[11167.38 → 11168.26] But anyway,
[11168.42 → 11169.50] it was like $160.
[11169.84 → 11171.66] It was shockingly affordable.
[11172.12 → 11172.22] Yeah.
[11172.22 → 11173.54] Both Yvonne and I
[11173.54 → 11175.78] got to operate the aircraft
[11175.78 → 11177.92] with a certified instructor
[11177.92 → 11179.70] in the plane with us.
[11179.78 → 11180.46] You both have a yoke.
[11180.56 → 11181.38] It's like actually pretty cool.
[11181.44 → 11181.62] Yeah,
[11181.70 → 11183.30] it was an absolute blast.
[11183.84 → 11184.82] And it was probably
[11184.82 → 11186.84] the best like bang for the buck
[11186.84 → 11190.54] sort of premium date experience
[11190.54 → 11191.26] that I've ever had
[11191.26 → 11193.36] in terms of like memorability
[11193.36 → 11198.16] and an actual like fun factor.
[11198.54 → 11199.44] Way better value
[11199.44 → 11200.26] than going to the movies.
[11201.08 → 11202.20] Like maybe less time.
[11202.50 → 11203.74] But awesome.
[11203.90 → 11204.16] Awesome.
[11204.62 → 11205.06] Ton of fun.
[11206.96 → 11209.56] I don't know,
[11209.66 → 11210.40] but there was one
[11210.40 → 11211.78] that I remembered
[11211.78 → 11212.30] that was,
[11212.76 → 11213.92] I doubt she would pick
[11213.92 → 11214.48] the same one.
[11214.70 → 11215.52] But I do know
[11215.52 → 11216.18] that she remembers
[11216.18 → 11217.72] this event rather fondly.
[11217.86 → 11219.00] We were supposed to go up
[11219.00 → 11220.38] to a particular lake.
[11220.52 → 11220.94] I don't remember
[11220.94 → 11221.48] the name of it.
[11222.46 → 11223.06] Harrison Lake,
[11223.16 → 11224.12] I think was the one.
[11224.36 → 11225.16] It's just been a few years.
[11225.22 → 11225.52] I don't remember
[11225.52 → 11226.12] which one it was.
[11227.04 → 11227.78] And we were supposed
[11227.78 → 11228.80] to go to a particular spot
[11228.80 → 11229.24] on it.
[11229.40 → 11230.00] And I was,
[11230.10 → 11230.84] I don't know if I was using
[11230.84 → 11231.72] my car's GPS
[11231.72 → 11232.40] or Google Maps
[11232.40 → 11234.00] or whatever one it was.
[11234.00 → 11235.16] It just didn't send us
[11235.16 → 11235.92] to the right spot
[11235.92 → 11237.02] at all.
[11237.12 → 11238.36] And I had never been there before.
[11238.74 → 11239.60] So we ended up
[11239.60 → 11241.44] on like some logging road,
[11241.50 → 11243.74] like halfway up the lake
[11243.74 → 11246.42] until looking to my left,
[11246.54 → 11247.94] I noticed through the trees
[11247.94 → 11249.26] that we were clearly
[11249.26 → 11250.92] on the side of the lake.
[11250.92 → 11252.22] and we were supposed
[11252.22 → 11252.86] to be approaching
[11252.86 → 11253.60] like the bottom
[11253.60 → 11254.12] of the lake
[11254.12 → 11255.20] and stopping right there.
[11255.20 → 11256.60] So I knew we were way off
[11256.60 → 11257.30] of where we were supposed
[11257.30 → 11257.64] to be.
[11257.92 → 11258.78] And so we had to turn around
[11258.78 → 11259.52] and go all the way back.
[11259.76 → 11260.82] We ended up being super late
[11260.82 → 11261.24] to the event
[11261.24 → 11262.16] that we were trying to go to.
[11262.76 → 11263.64] And then afterwards,
[11263.64 → 11264.96] we stayed at this
[11264.96 → 11266.64] Airbnb out there
[11266.64 → 11268.48] back when Airbnb was cool,
[11268.60 → 11269.84] which was like
[11269.84 → 11271.16] nowhere close
[11271.16 → 11271.76] to the town
[11271.76 → 11273.26] that we were visiting.
[11273.48 → 11274.48] But I picked it
[11274.48 → 11275.38] because it was like
[11275.38 → 11277.14] this really sick,
[11277.20 → 11277.80] like,
[11277.80 → 11279.68] old school farmstead
[11279.68 → 11281.86] as an Airbnb.
[11282.26 → 11282.92] Oh, that's cool.
[11283.08 → 11283.62] It was like,
[11283.76 → 11284.88] it was this really cool event.
[11285.42 → 11287.04] Taking my Acura
[11287.04 → 11288.60] onto a logging road
[11288.60 → 11290.46] was an event
[11290.46 → 11291.46] in its own right.
[11291.78 → 11293.08] That was the day
[11293.08 → 11293.94] that I was like,
[11294.20 → 11295.52] basically had to be like,
[11295.66 → 11295.98] all right,
[11296.82 → 11298.08] I'm not as worried
[11298.08 → 11299.08] about keeping this car
[11299.08 → 11299.90] pristine anymore.
[11301.02 → 11301.96] Because I'm like,
[11302.26 → 11303.00] cruising down
[11303.00 → 11304.54] a gravel logging road
[11304.54 → 11305.56] with rocks flying
[11305.56 → 11306.40] all over the place.
[11306.44 → 11306.86] And I was like,
[11306.98 → 11307.30] okay,
[11307.30 → 11309.26] nice.
[11309.62 → 11309.96] But yeah,
[11310.00 → 11311.30] it was cool
[11311.30 → 11312.58] because I have always
[11312.58 → 11313.36] liked
[11313.36 → 11316.28] going through
[11316.28 → 11317.14] things like that
[11317.14 → 11317.54] with people.
[11318.06 → 11318.68] I've always felt
[11318.68 → 11319.48] that as a bond
[11319.48 → 11320.16] strengthener.
[11320.32 → 11320.92] When you're able
[11320.92 → 11321.52] to go through
[11321.52 → 11321.98] some like,
[11322.16 → 11323.00] this kind of sucks,
[11323.18 → 11323.72] we have no idea
[11323.72 → 11324.52] where the heck we are,
[11324.68 → 11325.66] we're like up in the mountains,
[11325.70 → 11326.06] we're not supposed
[11326.06 → 11326.72] to be up in the mountains,
[11326.78 → 11327.24] we have to figure out
[11327.24 → 11327.78] where we're going,
[11328.04 → 11328.82] we have to do this thing,
[11328.86 → 11329.48] and then we're doing
[11329.48 → 11330.32] some weird thing afterwards,
[11330.54 → 11331.28] and you make it through
[11331.28 → 11332.26] and everyone has a good time
[11332.26 → 11332.76] and it's fun.
[11332.88 → 11333.56] That's always like
[11333.56 → 11334.38] a bond strengthening
[11334.38 → 11335.58] thing for me.
[11335.72 → 11336.64] I always liked those times.
[11336.64 → 11337.84] So that was a good one.
[11338.00 → 11338.48] Super cool.
[11343.26 → 11343.62] Oh,
[11343.64 → 11343.80] right,
[11343.82 → 11344.66] I'm supposed to do this.
[11344.80 → 11345.38] Gosh darn it.
[11345.52 → 11345.72] Sorry,
[11345.84 → 11346.54] I'm going through
[11346.54 → 11347.72] and I'm trying to reply
[11347.72 → 11348.54] to them right now
[11348.54 → 11349.14] and stuff too.
[11349.30 → 11351.42] So I'm trying to help Dan.
[11352.58 → 11353.22] There's only one
[11353.22 → 11353.70] an incoming.
[11353.96 → 11354.84] Michael asks,
[11355.16 → 11356.90] given survivor bias,
[11357.48 → 11358.58] do you have any estimate
[11358.58 → 11359.46] on how many people
[11359.46 → 11360.16] have failed
[11360.16 → 11361.40] where you have succeeded
[11361.40 → 11362.50] in your business space?
[11363.10 → 11363.34] Oh.
[11363.88 → 11364.28] Literally.
[11364.54 → 11365.72] Tens of thousands.
[11366.00 → 11366.52] Oceans, yeah.
[11366.58 → 11368.54] Do you have any anonymous anecdotes
[11368.54 → 11369.40] on what mistakes
[11369.40 → 11370.38] not to make?
[11371.38 → 11373.38] I think the biggest mistake,
[11373.92 → 11375.20] the biggest mistakes
[11375.20 → 11375.86] you can make
[11375.86 → 11378.72] are not being true
[11378.72 → 11379.50] to yourself
[11379.50 → 11381.26] and not listening
[11381.26 → 11382.04] to your audience.
[11382.46 → 11383.26] And on the surface,
[11383.52 → 11384.72] those might seem contradictory
[11384.72 → 11386.16] because how can you be
[11386.16 → 11387.02] true to yourself
[11387.02 → 11388.04] and listen to your audience
[11388.04 → 11388.76] and how can you listen
[11388.76 → 11389.28] to your audience
[11389.28 → 11390.28] while being true to yourself?
[11390.80 → 11392.44] But they actually work together
[11392.44 → 11393.36] because if you stay
[11393.36 → 11394.18] true to yourself,
[11394.18 → 11395.18] you should build
[11395.18 → 11395.74] an audience
[11395.74 → 11397.18] that will actually
[11397.18 → 11398.22] encourage you
[11398.22 → 11399.52] to stay on a path
[11399.52 → 11400.56] that is true to yourself
[11400.56 → 11401.36] while also being
[11401.36 → 11401.94] to their interests.
[11402.02 → 11402.60] That's how you build
[11402.60 → 11403.06] a community
[11403.06 → 11404.02] of like-minded people
[11404.02 → 11404.70] and that's what I think
[11404.70 → 11405.46] we've done really well.
[11405.60 → 11406.28] And you also shouldn't,
[11406.38 → 11407.78] you shouldn't be 100% rigid
[11407.78 → 11409.14] in every single thing ever.
[11409.74 → 11410.42] So your audience
[11410.42 → 11411.36] might have good ideas
[11411.36 → 11412.54] and might have good feedback.
[11412.72 → 11413.08] That doesn't mean
[11413.08 → 11413.50] you have to listen
[11413.50 → 11414.14] to all of it,
[11414.22 → 11414.70] but you should listen
[11414.70 → 11415.22] to some of it
[11415.22 → 11416.34] so you can grow and improve.
[11416.94 → 11417.98] Yeah, I agree with that.
[11418.40 → 11419.20] Jason says,
[11419.30 → 11420.24] getting the WAN desk pad
[11420.24 → 11420.90] for a new setup.
[11421.22 → 11423.96] Two systems in the DK05F.
[11424.28 → 11424.96] Sick setup.
[11425.38 → 11425.82] I was wondering
[11425.82 → 11426.82] if you could say anything more
[11426.82 → 11428.28] on yours and Alex's experience
[11428.28 → 11428.88] building in it
[11428.88 → 11430.02] that didn't get into the video.
[11430.86 → 11431.92] That's a better question
[11431.92 → 11432.50] for Alex.
[11432.64 → 11433.32] You might want to like
[11433.32 → 11434.16] tweet at him or something
[11434.16 → 11435.20] because I don't think
[11435.20 → 11437.08] I did much on that video.
[11437.80 → 11439.38] Sometimes I am,
[11439.52 → 11441.36] I am deeply involved
[11441.36 → 11442.50] and other times
[11442.50 → 11443.62] I am quite a bit
[11443.62 → 11444.56] less involved
[11444.56 → 11445.34] in the actual
[11445.34 → 11446.24] building of the system.
[11446.34 → 11447.20] I think Jake might have
[11447.20 → 11448.44] had a hand in that one as well.
[11449.72 → 11451.86] Yeah, that thing is super cool,
[11452.20 → 11454.64] but also not necessarily
[11454.64 → 11455.72] the most practical,
[11455.92 → 11457.50] which I'm sure you are
[11457.50 → 11458.78] well enough aware.
[11460.02 → 11460.80] Gavin says,
[11460.88 → 11461.30] hey Luke,
[11461.64 → 11462.96] after the issues with Markov,
[11463.02 → 11463.50] have you picked up
[11463.50 → 11464.06] any other games
[11464.06 → 11465.00] to play in its place?
[11466.26 → 11467.74] I sort of answered this
[11467.74 → 11468.54] earlier as well,
[11468.62 → 11469.16] but like, no.
[11470.22 → 11470.80] Oh, that's right.
[11470.80 → 11471.42] I think it's a different
[11471.42 → 11472.50] person asking.
[11472.50 → 11473.34] Okay, what would it be?
[11474.34 → 11474.96] Like, what would,
[11475.12 → 11476.12] what's your alternative?
[11476.32 → 11476.84] So they're saying
[11476.84 → 11477.86] they play Hunt Showdown.
[11477.86 → 11478.80] I've looked into Hunt Showdown.
[11478.90 → 11479.94] I'm not that into it.
[11480.32 → 11481.04] What's the difference?
[11481.04 → 11483.08] I think it's a similar
[11483.08 → 11484.22] type of game
[11484.22 → 11486.78] in a few different ways,
[11486.78 → 11487.66] but it's like,
[11487.96 → 11488.68] if I'm,
[11489.20 → 11489.56] man,
[11489.80 → 11490.56] the last time I played
[11490.56 → 11491.62] it was many years ago.
[11491.76 → 11492.84] If I remember correctly,
[11492.92 → 11493.18] it's like,
[11493.22 → 11494.40] it has like a horror base
[11494.40 → 11494.88] as well,
[11494.88 → 11495.54] and there's like
[11495.54 → 11497.44] giant spiders
[11497.44 → 11498.54] and zombies and stuff
[11498.54 → 11499.24] that you're fighting off
[11499.24 → 11499.98] at the same time,
[11499.98 → 11501.16] and it's just not really
[11501.16 → 11503.68] my vibe.
[11503.84 → 11504.96] It has some similarities,
[11504.96 → 11506.20] but it's a very different game.
[11506.78 → 11506.94] Some,
[11507.16 → 11508.46] the community that likes
[11508.46 → 11508.96] that game
[11508.96 → 11510.28] is really into it.
[11510.40 → 11510.76] So like,
[11510.86 → 11511.68] if you want to try it,
[11511.72 → 11511.80] like,
[11511.86 → 11513.04] don't let me dissuade you.
[11513.38 → 11514.62] It's just not for me,
[11514.74 → 11515.10] personally.
[11515.76 → 11516.92] I've tried a few other games
[11516.92 → 11517.52] in the space too.
[11517.58 → 11518.32] I've tried Area.
[11518.80 → 11519.52] I've tried a bunch
[11519.52 → 11519.96] of other things.
[11520.10 → 11521.70] None of it really hits.
[11522.06 → 11522.42] I don't know.
[11524.26 → 11525.48] I guess if it doesn't have
[11525.48 → 11526.50] that same depth
[11526.50 → 11528.46] to the sim-ness of it.
[11528.46 → 11529.16] And you could argue
[11529.16 → 11530.00] that Area does
[11530.00 → 11531.00] in a bunch of different ways,
[11531.10 → 11531.54] but then,
[11533.34 → 11534.34] some people are like this.
[11534.34 → 11535.34] I find Area to be
[11535.34 → 11536.04] very clunky.
[11536.94 → 11537.78] I'm not a huge fan
[11537.78 → 11538.40] of the controls.
[11538.46 → 11539.18] Right.
[11540.44 → 11541.24] I don't know.
[11541.40 → 11541.74] It's just,
[11542.18 → 11542.78] Markov just needs
[11542.78 → 11543.46] to figure it out.
[11544.20 → 11545.32] That's basically it.
[11545.48 → 11546.62] D'Arkansan M.
[11547.60 → 11548.52] I understand how unlikely
[11548.52 → 11548.96] this is,
[11549.02 → 11549.64] but I wanted to know
[11549.64 → 11550.32] if Linus thinks
[11550.32 → 11551.34] LMG might ever be
[11551.34 → 11551.80] in a position
[11551.80 → 11553.38] to hire truck drivers.
[11554.40 → 11554.88] Sincerely,
[11555.18 → 11556.08] a truck driver
[11556.08 → 11556.84] named Zeus.
[11557.10 → 11557.58] Zeus.
[11557.84 → 11558.46] Love it,
[11558.56 → 11559.08] by the way.
[11559.08 → 11559.18] Sick name.
[11561.54 → 11562.46] I don't know.
[11562.70 → 11562.98] I mean,
[11563.02 → 11564.88] if LCI ever takes off
[11564.88 → 11566.00] and we become like a
[11566.00 → 11566.22] you know,
[11566.32 → 11568.36] giant tech,
[11568.80 → 11570.22] retailer or something,
[11570.38 → 11570.84] obviously,
[11571.08 → 11572.02] we'd need truck drivers
[11572.02 → 11572.50] for that,
[11572.58 → 11572.74] but.
[11572.80 → 11573.46] There's a future
[11573.46 → 11574.32] where it could happen.
[11574.56 → 11574.86] Yeah,
[11574.96 → 11575.36] but I,
[11575.44 → 11576.48] I kind of doubt it.
[11576.54 → 11576.96] I don't know
[11576.96 → 11577.58] if we're ever gonna,
[11577.74 → 11578.04] I don't know
[11578.04 → 11578.44] if we're ever gonna
[11578.44 → 11579.52] make it to that future.
[11579.52 → 11580.34] We would probably
[11580.34 → 11581.66] use another service
[11581.66 → 11583.20] that they happen
[11583.20 → 11584.14] to hire truck drivers,
[11584.30 → 11584.86] I feel like.
[11584.86 → 11586.14] I don't know.
[11586.28 → 11586.44] Yeah,
[11586.52 → 11586.82] maybe.
[11587.26 → 11587.50] Maybe.
[11588.62 → 11589.38] Anonymous asks,
[11589.46 → 11589.98] what made you choose
[11589.98 → 11590.46] the Taycan
[11590.46 → 11591.80] over one of the
[11591.80 → 11592.82] e-hybrid models
[11592.82 → 11593.38] from Porsche?
[11593.50 → 11594.48] You've strongly advocated
[11594.48 → 11595.48] for hybrids in the past.
[11595.88 → 11596.64] I'm looking at getting
[11596.64 → 11598.38] a used Cayenne e-hybrid.
[11598.56 → 11600.06] Curious on your thoughts.
[11600.66 → 11601.98] I'm going to be honest with you,
[11602.32 → 11606.44] I hate going to the gas station.
[11607.06 → 11608.18] It's one of those things
[11608.18 → 11609.28] that just makes me
[11609.28 → 11610.54] irrationally annoyed
[11610.54 → 11612.04] when I have to stop
[11612.04 → 11612.76] and get gas.
[11612.96 → 11613.12] I,
[11613.40 → 11615.18] I like going straight
[11615.18 → 11616.18] from where I am
[11616.18 → 11617.36] to where I want to be
[11617.36 → 11618.50] and I don't like stopping.
[11618.70 → 11619.50] I'm just like a
[11619.90 → 11620.60] I'm like a go,
[11620.72 → 11620.86] go,
[11620.96 → 11622.00] go kind of person
[11622.00 → 11623.64] and I want to never
[11623.64 → 11624.90] go to the gas station again
[11624.90 → 11626.16] and so the Taycan
[11626.16 → 11627.52] is really great for that.
[11629.74 → 11631.42] I also don't want an SUV.
[11631.66 → 11632.02] I don't,
[11632.06 → 11632.44] I don't,
[11632.58 → 11633.44] I don't enjoy
[11633.44 → 11635.00] the SUV driving experience.
[11635.10 → 11635.78] With that said,
[11635.82 → 11636.90] I've never driven a Cayenne.
[11636.98 → 11637.62] Maybe it's like
[11637.62 → 11639.00] not very SUV-like.
[11639.06 → 11639.66] Maybe it's awesome
[11639.66 → 11640.74] but I,
[11640.80 → 11642.08] I like being low to the ground.
[11642.18 → 11643.26] I've always preferred
[11643.26 → 11644.16] to be low to the ground.
[11645.50 → 11645.70] I'm,
[11645.70 → 11646.56] I'm really happy
[11646.56 → 11647.30] with it so far.
[11647.38 → 11648.36] I have absolutely
[11648.36 → 11650.72] no regrets whatsoever
[11650.72 → 11651.70] no matter how stupid
[11651.70 → 11652.80] some of my badminton buddies
[11652.80 → 11653.34] think I am.
[11655.36 → 11657.08] One of them has like an i8
[11657.08 → 11657.84] I think it is.
[11657.90 → 11659.76] Whatever that BMW hybrid one is.
[11660.20 → 11660.34] Well,
[11660.38 → 11661.64] that's the like supercar thing.
[11661.80 → 11662.08] Yeah,
[11662.14 → 11662.38] yeah,
[11662.38 → 11664.06] it looks sick.
[11665.02 → 11665.42] Very,
[11665.58 → 11667.30] very striking looking car
[11667.30 → 11668.44] with like the
[11668.44 → 11668.76] the
[11668.76 → 11669.64] the doors like this.
[11670.20 → 11670.94] Not like this.
[11671.44 → 11671.80] Um,
[11672.04 → 11676.84] Oh man.
[11677.40 → 11677.60] Oh,
[11677.72 → 11677.98] right.
[11678.10 → 11678.74] I'm still supposed
[11678.74 → 11679.46] to keep doing things.
[11679.54 → 11680.04] I'm sending that one
[11680.04 → 11680.40] to Tynan.
[11681.74 → 11681.94] Uh,
[11681.94 → 11682.16] okay,
[11682.24 → 11682.44] cool.
[11682.76 → 11683.08] Uh,
[11683.08 → 11683.48] for Linus,
[11683.52 → 11684.42] have there been any discussions
[11684.42 → 11686.14] about offering blank teas
[11686.14 → 11687.18] to creators like Goat
[11687.18 → 11687.92] to put their designs on?
[11688.00 → 11688.16] I mean,
[11688.20 → 11688.66] absolutely.
[11688.80 → 11689.12] It's something
[11689.12 → 11689.84] Creator Warehouse
[11689.84 → 11691.32] would love to get into.
[11691.80 → 11692.20] Uh,
[11692.20 → 11693.56] it's kind of where the name
[11693.56 → 11694.20] like came from
[11694.20 → 11694.90] in the first place.
[11694.92 → 11695.34] There's a reason
[11695.34 → 11695.74] we just,
[11695.82 → 11696.84] didn't just call it
[11696.84 → 11698.28] Linus Tech Tips
[11698.28 → 11699.20] merch company.
[11700.12 → 11700.52] Um,
[11700.68 → 11701.30] but it's,
[11701.46 → 11701.98] thank goodness.
[11702.66 → 11704.02] There's a lot of logistics
[11704.02 → 11704.86] to figure out.
[11704.98 → 11705.16] You know,
[11705.16 → 11705.80] you have to,
[11705.80 → 11706.62] you have to build
[11706.62 → 11707.42] those relationships.
[11707.42 → 11708.10] You have to,
[11708.10 → 11708.62] you know,
[11708.66 → 11709.72] build trust with creators.
[11709.72 → 11710.08] Uh,
[11710.08 → 11711.64] we had one fairly prominent
[11711.64 → 11712.52] creator recently
[11712.52 → 11714.08] that we were even working
[11714.08 → 11715.52] on some custom products for,
[11715.68 → 11715.90] but,
[11715.90 → 11716.86] um,
[11717.08 → 11717.82] just kind of stopped
[11717.82 → 11718.70] replying to emails.
[11719.04 → 11719.40] Um,
[11719.48 → 11720.08] I don't,
[11720.18 → 11720.90] I'd love to know
[11720.90 → 11722.84] what the problem was
[11722.84 → 11723.68] because we actually went
[11723.68 → 11725.20] as far as getting samples in
[11725.20 → 11727.22] and trying to book a time
[11727.22 → 11727.84] with this person
[11727.84 → 11729.56] to show them to them
[11729.56 → 11731.26] so that they could tell us
[11731.26 → 11731.92] if they were good
[11731.92 → 11732.58] and then we could,
[11732.64 → 11732.88] you know,
[11732.88 → 11733.56] do a size run
[11733.56 → 11733.86] and like,
[11733.94 → 11734.68] like we were working
[11734.68 → 11735.88] on some full custom projects
[11735.88 → 11736.60] and just,
[11736.60 → 11737.84] uh,
[11737.84 → 11738.90] just kind of disappeared
[11738.90 → 11739.20] and,
[11739.92 → 11740.32] um,
[11740.44 → 11740.74] since,
[11740.82 → 11741.38] since then,
[11741.38 → 11741.80] this,
[11741.92 → 11742.12] uh,
[11742.12 → 11743.22] this person has launched
[11743.22 → 11744.14] a merch lineup
[11744.14 → 11745.68] through another company
[11745.68 → 11746.92] and it's kind of like,
[11746.96 → 11747.16] okay,
[11747.18 → 11747.34] well,
[11747.36 → 11747.80] it would have been
[11747.80 → 11750.04] nice to not read about that
[11750.04 → 11750.60] in the news,
[11750.72 → 11751.04] maybe,
[11751.26 → 11751.46] but,
[11751.74 → 11752.08] um,
[11752.16 → 11752.32] you know,
[11752.34 → 11752.46] hey,
[11752.50 → 11753.30] good luck on the launch
[11753.30 → 11754.28] and then I just never heard back
[11754.28 → 11755.04] and so I'm kind of
[11755.04 → 11756.22] wondering if maybe
[11756.22 → 11757.54] some messages got lost
[11757.54 → 11758.10] or something
[11758.10 → 11759.22] because that's sort of
[11759.22 → 11759.66] the only,
[11759.80 → 11760.56] the only real thing
[11760.56 → 11761.30] I can think of.
[11761.46 → 11761.60] Yeah.
[11761.86 → 11762.30] But yeah,
[11762.32 → 11763.00] stuff happens,
[11763.04 → 11763.22] right?
[11763.24 → 11763.46] Like,
[11763.50 → 11764.08] life happens,
[11764.24 → 11764.88] business happens
[11764.88 → 11765.56] and I'm not,
[11765.64 → 11766.22] I'm not taking it
[11766.22 → 11766.96] personally or anything.
[11766.96 → 11768.52] The point of telling the story
[11768.52 → 11769.24] was just that
[11769.24 → 11770.34] it can be very challenging.
[11770.96 → 11771.34] Um,
[11771.58 → 11771.92] so yeah,
[11771.98 → 11772.14] we'd,
[11772.14 → 11772.66] we'd love to,
[11772.76 → 11774.94] but one of the issues
[11774.94 → 11776.46] I think with our,
[11776.46 → 11777.62] with our model
[11777.62 → 11779.74] is that you kind of
[11779.74 → 11781.92] have to bet big on things.
[11782.56 → 11784.10] Even for blank t-shirts,
[11784.66 → 11785.98] no printing company
[11785.98 → 11788.14] that has decent quality
[11788.14 → 11789.42] is going to print
[11789.42 → 11790.78] 30 shirts for you.
[11791.08 → 11791.56] Like,
[11791.60 → 11792.22] that's stupid.
[11792.32 → 11793.40] That's not even worth them
[11793.40 → 11794.54] setting up the screen printing.
[11794.90 → 11795.38] So,
[11795.68 → 11796.92] unless you're going to print
[11796.92 → 11797.86] hundreds of shirts,
[11798.54 → 11798.88] um,
[11799.08 → 11800.10] I don't even know,
[11800.28 → 11800.84] I don't even know
[11800.84 → 11801.66] if we can help you.
[11802.34 → 11802.66] Right?
[11802.98 → 11803.38] And,
[11803.58 → 11804.80] if you're going to print
[11804.80 → 11805.54] hundreds of shirts
[11805.54 → 11807.26] and you don't sell them,
[11807.78 → 11808.18] then,
[11808.42 → 11810.54] I don't know,
[11810.60 → 11811.14] we'd have to have
[11811.14 → 11812.30] some kind of system
[11812.30 → 11813.40] for passing through
[11813.40 → 11814.30] storage costs
[11814.30 → 11815.14] or something.
[11815.28 → 11815.46] I,
[11815.46 → 11816.14] I don't know.
[11816.20 → 11816.42] There's,
[11816.62 → 11817.44] there'd be a lot of things
[11817.44 → 11817.98] to figure out.
[11817.98 → 11818.32] We've got to figure it out.
[11818.46 → 11818.58] Yeah.
[11818.64 → 11818.82] Yeah.
[11818.82 → 11820.98] I do know
[11820.98 → 11821.74] that there is
[11821.74 → 11822.62] a company out there,
[11822.70 → 11823.50] uh,
[11823.60 → 11825.06] that I was planning
[11825.06 → 11825.48] on talking to you
[11825.48 → 11826.06] about next week
[11826.06 → 11826.90] and we're not going
[11826.90 → 11827.62] to fully talk about now,
[11827.70 → 11828.30] uh,
[11828.30 → 11829.28] but they do merch stuff
[11829.28 → 11830.38] and they have,
[11830.56 → 11831.08] they have,
[11831.12 → 11831.56] uh,
[11831.98 → 11836.78] been inspired
[11836.78 → 11838.28] by the work
[11838.28 → 11839.50] of merch messages.
[11839.98 → 11840.42] Oh,
[11840.48 → 11840.70] really?
[11840.70 → 11841.12] I'll refrain
[11841.12 → 11842.02] from saying copied,
[11842.38 → 11842.54] but.
[11842.70 → 11842.82] Oh,
[11842.88 → 11843.10] really?
[11843.36 → 11843.56] Yeah.
[11844.32 → 11844.72] Oh,
[11844.78 → 11845.36] that's hilarious.
[11845.76 → 11845.98] Yep.
[11845.98 → 11846.76] Um,
[11846.84 → 11847.18] I mean,
[11847.28 → 11847.58] hey,
[11847.74 → 11848.40] it's nice to be
[11848.40 → 11848.86] an innovator,
[11848.92 → 11849.12] right?
[11850.80 → 11851.20] Yeah.
[11851.64 → 11852.00] Good job,
[11852.08 → 11852.30] Conrad.
[11852.94 → 11853.34] Um,
[11853.56 → 11854.04] okay.
[11856.74 → 11857.54] Eris says,
[11857.68 → 11859.10] the 3DS and Wii U
[11859.10 → 11860.14] shop are closing
[11860.14 → 11861.08] and access to games
[11861.08 → 11861.90] there is ending.
[11862.20 → 11863.12] I've been buying games
[11863.12 → 11864.06] I wasn't able to get
[11864.06 → 11865.18] since I still enjoy
[11865.18 → 11865.76] my 3DS.
[11865.92 → 11866.64] Were there any games
[11866.64 → 11867.60] that you enjoyed on them?
[11867.92 → 11869.16] I never had a Wii U
[11869.16 → 11870.42] and I never had a 3DS.
[11870.74 → 11873.64] You borrowed my 2DS
[11873.64 → 11874.72] because I was cheap.
[11874.72 → 11876.34] uh,
[11876.38 → 11877.14] to play,
[11877.14 → 11877.78] uh,
[11879.88 → 11880.56] Bravely Default?
[11881.24 → 11881.64] Yes,
[11881.68 → 11882.22] I did.
[11882.32 → 11882.52] Yeah.
[11882.76 → 11883.98] I forgot about that.
[11884.12 → 11884.32] Yeah.
[11885.22 → 11885.64] Okay.
[11885.92 → 11886.32] Um,
[11886.40 → 11886.60] well,
[11886.64 → 11887.66] I played Bravely Default
[11887.66 → 11889.06] and that was,
[11889.38 → 11889.96] um,
[11890.56 → 11891.08] okay.
[11892.08 → 11893.34] There are better
[11893.34 → 11894.48] retro RPG
[11894.48 → 11895.54] inspired games now
[11895.54 → 11896.56] and Bravely Default 2.
[11896.74 → 11897.36] I finished it,
[11897.44 → 11897.92] but I like
[11897.92 → 11899.26] kind of forced myself
[11899.26 → 11899.70] to do it.
[11899.82 → 11900.76] The deal for that
[11900.76 → 11902.08] was,
[11902.18 → 11902.66] he was like,
[11902.76 → 11902.92] yeah,
[11902.94 → 11903.52] it's going to like
[11903.52 → 11904.30] take me a while.
[11904.30 → 11905.38] So be aware of that,
[11905.52 → 11906.90] but I'm going to buy
[11906.90 → 11907.60] Bravely Default
[11907.60 → 11908.70] and if you're down,
[11908.88 → 11910.00] I'll borrow your 2DS
[11910.00 → 11910.72] and then you can just
[11910.72 → 11911.28] have the game
[11911.28 → 11911.80] when I'm done.
[11912.54 → 11913.06] And I was like,
[11913.10 → 11913.32] uh,
[11913.32 → 11913.48] yeah,
[11913.48 → 11913.74] sure.
[11913.90 → 11914.44] And then when you
[11914.44 → 11914.88] gave it back,
[11914.92 → 11915.28] you were like,
[11915.76 → 11916.26] I don't know
[11916.26 → 11917.20] if I'd bother play it.
[11918.20 → 11918.90] So I,
[11919.00 → 11920.32] I still have
[11920.32 → 11921.38] the Bravely Default
[11921.38 → 11921.82] cartridge
[11921.82 → 11922.66] and have still
[11922.66 → 11923.94] never actually played it
[11923.94 → 11924.78] because I was just like,
[11924.84 → 11925.18] yeah.
[11925.28 → 11925.68] You should play
[11925.68 → 11926.74] Final Fantasy Tactics.
[11926.90 → 11927.06] Yeah.
[11927.22 → 11927.50] Yeah.
[11927.80 → 11928.14] Or,
[11928.30 → 11929.04] or you could play
[11929.04 → 11930.16] my all-time favourite,
[11930.44 → 11931.26] Final Fantasy VI.
[11932.42 → 11932.60] Like,
[11932.66 → 11933.92] he still hasn't played it.
[11934.74 → 11935.26] F***.
[11935.50 → 11936.32] Have you watched?
[11936.78 → 11937.34] This would take
[11937.34 → 11938.38] significantly less time.
[11938.38 → 11938.40] I know,
[11938.40 → 11939.24] I haven't watched
[11939.24 → 11940.26] Pirates of Silicon Valley.
[11940.26 → 11941.32] I haven't watched
[11941.32 → 11942.42] Pirates of Silicon Valley.
[11942.64 → 11942.92] Like,
[11942.98 → 11944.14] many hours less.
[11944.24 → 11944.80] I know.
[11945.32 → 11945.60] Okay,
[11945.76 → 11946.44] if I watch
[11946.44 → 11947.32] Pirates of Silicon Valley,
[11947.38 → 11947.66] you'll play
[11947.66 → 11948.44] Final Fantasy VI.
[11949.42 → 11950.28] That is not
[11950.28 → 11951.16] an even trade.
[11951.56 → 11951.78] But,
[11952.12 → 11952.64] Oh!
[11953.80 → 11954.58] Speaking of,
[11954.58 → 11954.86] But,
[11954.90 → 11955.10] sure.
[11955.38 → 11956.94] Speaking of terrible deals.
[11957.14 → 11957.48] Okay,
[11957.82 → 11958.66] I still don't know
[11958.66 → 11959.56] if it's okay for the birds.
[11959.72 → 11960.98] I'm trying to figure it out.
[11962.00 → 11962.38] It's a hard,
[11962.48 → 11962.70] it's a
[11962.74 → 11963.36] it's not a like
[11963.36 → 11964.30] easy answer to grab.
[11964.40 → 11964.72] Okay,
[11965.06 → 11966.44] he is,
[11966.58 → 11968.34] he is getting
[11968.34 → 11969.42] a new computer
[11969.42 → 11971.08] and a NAS upgrade,
[11971.38 → 11973.24] but all he has to do
[11973.24 → 11974.58] is have it be
[11974.58 → 11975.66] mineral oil cooled.
[11976.54 → 11976.98] Or,
[11977.14 → 11977.38] well,
[11977.38 → 11978.70] a new fluid.
[11978.88 → 11979.02] Yeah.
[11979.10 → 11980.50] A new not mineral oil fluid.
[11980.66 → 11980.84] Yeah.
[11981.24 → 11981.40] My,
[11981.44 → 11981.98] my problem
[11981.98 → 11983.44] is I have
[11983.44 → 11985.14] two small birds
[11985.14 → 11986.06] and there are a lot
[11986.06 → 11987.14] of different things
[11987.14 → 11987.84] like that
[11987.84 → 11989.22] that are extremely
[11989.22 → 11991.16] critically unsafe.
[11991.60 → 11992.04] Like,
[11992.12 → 11993.18] will kill them very quickly
[11993.18 → 11994.08] type of stuff.
[11994.50 → 11995.72] There are a lot of different chemicals
[11995.72 → 11996.48] you have to stop using
[11996.48 → 11996.96] in your home.
[11997.12 → 11997.32] If you,
[11997.40 → 11998.04] if you get birds,
[11998.08 → 11998.98] you have to start cooking
[11998.98 → 11999.66] with different
[11999.66 → 12001.18] things.
[12001.26 → 12002.60] You can't use nonstick pans
[12002.60 → 12003.32] and all this kind of stuff
[12003.32 → 12003.94] because it kills them
[12003.94 → 12004.66] really fast.
[12005.72 → 12006.12] So,
[12006.22 → 12006.88] I need to like,
[12006.88 → 12007.90] for sure make
[12007.90 → 12008.50] that it's okay.
[12008.70 → 12009.70] And most things
[12009.70 → 12010.86] don't have like a
[12011.26 → 12012.50] is this okay for birds
[12012.50 → 12013.64] or not section
[12013.64 → 12014.64] on their like product
[12014.64 → 12015.16] information.
[12016.00 → 12016.44] So,
[12016.54 → 12017.44] it's not necessarily
[12017.44 → 12018.10] the easiest thing
[12018.10 → 12018.48] to figure out.
[12018.50 → 12019.44] But I am working on it.
[12020.12 → 12020.68] I am working on it.
[12020.68 → 12021.58] I think Dan's going to
[12021.58 → 12022.50] have to weigh on in this,
[12022.64 → 12023.86] weigh in on this next one
[12023.86 → 12024.86] from Aaron S.
[12025.40 → 12026.26] Had to get a second
[12026.26 → 12026.90] pack of underwear
[12026.90 → 12027.74] because now I feel
[12027.74 → 12029.00] uncomfortable in anything else.
[12029.34 → 12029.52] Yeah.
[12030.02 → 12030.46] Relatable.
[12030.46 → 12032.32] question.
[12032.84 → 12034.12] I like to buy
[12034.12 → 12035.06] vinyl copies
[12035.06 → 12036.24] of my favourite albums.
[12036.48 → 12037.88] Do either of you all
[12037.88 → 12039.54] own any music anymore?
[12040.52 → 12040.86] Yes,
[12040.98 → 12041.46] of course.
[12041.76 → 12042.76] I've got vinyl.
[12043.40 → 12044.64] I'm of the generation
[12044.64 → 12045.68] where we kept
[12045.68 → 12046.66] highly curated
[12046.66 → 12047.52] MP3
[12047.52 → 12048.96] folders
[12048.96 → 12050.92] to copy
[12050.92 → 12052.26] onto your MP3 player.
[12052.46 → 12053.42] So that's kind of like
[12053.42 → 12054.68] my generation's vinyl.
[12055.08 → 12056.08] But I really like vinyl.
[12056.18 → 12056.70] I think it's fun.
[12057.62 → 12058.66] I don't like it
[12058.66 → 12059.80] because it necessarily
[12059.80 → 12060.44] sounds better.
[12060.58 → 12061.30] I'm not going to piss
[12061.30 → 12062.38] anybody off by saying
[12062.38 → 12062.98] what I just did.
[12063.06 → 12063.36] Aw, crap.
[12064.86 → 12065.86] A lot of people here
[12065.86 → 12066.24] at the office
[12066.24 → 12066.82] collect it too.
[12067.02 → 12067.88] The covers are great.
[12067.88 → 12070.12] The art is great.
[12070.32 → 12071.64] I don't like buying
[12071.64 → 12073.32] music that I've heard before.
[12073.52 → 12074.68] I will buy
[12074.68 → 12075.42] random
[12075.42 → 12076.22] single
[12076.22 → 12077.22] or limited run
[12077.22 → 12077.80] pressings
[12077.80 → 12079.10] of stuff I've never heard
[12079.10 → 12079.92] that's only available
[12079.92 → 12080.48] on vinyl.
[12081.46 → 12083.04] And most of its bad.
[12083.84 → 12085.50] But it's awesome.
[12085.94 → 12086.32] It's like
[12086.32 → 12088.12] a grab bag, right?
[12088.20 → 12088.80] Kinder Surprise.
[12088.94 → 12089.74] Yeah, it's a Kinder Surprise
[12089.74 → 12091.06] of terrible, terrible music.
[12091.24 → 12091.56] Okay.
[12091.72 → 12092.40] I have some vinyl
[12092.40 → 12093.22] but most of my vinyl
[12093.22 → 12094.32] I have purchased
[12094.32 → 12096.12] for like collection reasons.
[12096.22 → 12097.54] I have the Bastion soundtrack.
[12097.88 → 12098.28] A lot of them
[12098.28 → 12099.18] are gaming soundtracks.
[12099.98 → 12101.04] I think it's stupid.
[12101.96 → 12102.78] So there you go.
[12102.86 → 12103.92] There's the entire spectrum.
[12105.28 → 12107.14] The day that I have...
[12108.34 → 12108.96] I don't think it's like
[12108.96 → 12109.30] cool or smart.
[12109.30 → 12109.98] And it's ironic
[12109.98 → 12111.10] because I totally
[12111.10 → 12111.94] have space
[12111.94 → 12113.64] to store like records
[12113.64 → 12115.36] but I just can't think
[12115.36 → 12116.82] of anything less valuable
[12116.82 → 12118.18] that I could possibly
[12118.18 → 12119.28] put in that space.
[12119.44 → 12120.12] Not going to lie.
[12120.24 → 12120.84] I got them
[12120.84 → 12122.04] and I used to play them
[12122.04 → 12122.62] because I used to do
[12122.62 → 12123.40] this thing where like
[12123.40 → 12124.80] I would do house chores
[12124.80 → 12126.58] during one record
[12126.58 → 12127.80] and then be like,
[12127.88 → 12127.98] all right,
[12128.02 → 12128.78] I did that amount of time.
[12130.48 → 12131.76] Since I used to do that,
[12132.04 → 12132.86] they have definitely
[12132.86 → 12133.86] never been played.
[12134.72 → 12135.98] And they very likely
[12135.98 → 12137.06] like never will be again.
[12137.66 → 12139.52] They're just so inconvenient
[12139.52 → 12140.24] at this point.
[12140.32 → 12141.00] Don't tell anyone
[12141.00 → 12142.02] but I kind of agree
[12142.02 → 12142.74] with Linus.
[12144.58 → 12145.38] I have,
[12145.66 → 12146.20] like,
[12147.54 → 12148.42] for what
[12148.42 → 12150.26] some people will spend
[12150.26 → 12151.44] on their vinyl collection,
[12151.88 → 12153.38] I have my entire house
[12153.38 → 12153.96] wired up
[12153.96 → 12155.80] with Wi-Fi enabled
[12155.80 → 12156.66] smart speakers
[12156.66 → 12157.74] so that I can stream
[12157.74 → 12159.04] anything from any device
[12159.04 → 12159.56] in my house,
[12159.62 → 12160.36] my kids can,
[12161.18 → 12162.60] into any room
[12162.60 → 12163.40] or any combination
[12163.40 → 12163.90] of rooms
[12163.90 → 12164.52] and I'm sitting here
[12164.52 → 12165.10] going like,
[12166.30 → 12170.72] that's how you do it.
[12171.00 → 12173.26] Ironically,
[12173.44 → 12173.78] again,
[12173.92 → 12175.04] I actually own
[12175.04 → 12175.78] a turntable
[12175.78 → 12177.68] but only because
[12177.68 → 12178.88] YouTube sent it out
[12178.88 → 12179.56] as like a
[12179.56 → 12179.78] like,
[12179.84 → 12181.08] trendy YouTuber gift
[12181.08 → 12181.96] and I just,
[12182.44 → 12183.32] it's like,
[12183.54 → 12184.98] branded after the channel
[12184.98 → 12186.50] and YouTube
[12186.50 → 12187.10] and stuff
[12187.10 → 12187.46] and I'm like,
[12187.46 → 12190.04] now I just have this.
[12190.46 → 12190.86] Well,
[12190.96 → 12191.52] at least you'll have
[12191.52 → 12192.26] something to play
[12192.26 → 12193.60] the LTT Christmas album
[12193.60 → 12194.72] vinyl release on.
[12194.72 → 12198.64] That will not exist.
[12202.28 → 12202.84] Yeah.
[12203.36 → 12204.64] Linus was always curious
[12204.64 → 12205.48] what your go-to
[12205.48 → 12206.76] badminton kit is.
[12207.26 → 12207.42] What,
[12207.50 → 12207.66] like,
[12207.80 → 12208.24] rackets,
[12208.40 → 12208.62] shoes,
[12208.80 → 12209.06] strings,
[12209.22 → 12209.52] tension,
[12209.78 → 12210.06] everything.
[12210.32 → 12210.74] Okay.
[12211.10 → 12211.50] So,
[12211.72 → 12213.12] compared to,
[12214.24 → 12215.62] hold on,
[12215.74 → 12216.04] archive.
[12216.44 → 12216.60] Cool.
[12217.00 → 12218.20] Compared to,
[12218.84 → 12219.22] I,
[12219.52 → 12220.40] how do I put this?
[12220.40 → 12220.86] So,
[12221.12 → 12222.74] the badminton community
[12222.74 → 12224.36] is either
[12224.36 → 12225.82] kind of
[12225.82 → 12227.28] Northern European
[12227.28 → 12229.04] for the most part
[12229.04 → 12230.34] or skews
[12230.34 → 12232.00] heavily Asian,
[12232.16 → 12233.38] especially Southeast Asian.
[12233.78 → 12234.14] So,
[12234.38 → 12235.06] the countries
[12235.06 → 12235.72] where badminton
[12235.72 → 12236.82] is huge,
[12236.92 → 12237.52] places like
[12237.52 → 12237.94] Malaysia,
[12238.12 → 12238.64] Thailand,
[12239.18 → 12239.88] Japan,
[12240.26 → 12240.68] China,
[12241.32 → 12241.68] India,
[12241.96 → 12242.10] like,
[12242.26 → 12243.56] badminton is enormous
[12243.56 → 12244.34] in those areas
[12244.34 → 12244.92] and then Denmark
[12244.92 → 12245.74] of all places
[12245.74 → 12246.60] is like,
[12246.64 → 12247.54] world-class.
[12247.94 → 12248.36] Like,
[12248.42 → 12249.32] they have the number one
[12249.32 → 12250.12] men's singles player
[12250.12 → 12250.60] right now,
[12250.68 → 12251.22] Victor Abelson.
[12252.98 → 12253.46] So,
[12253.56 → 12253.70] anyway,
[12253.76 → 12254.28] my problem
[12254.28 → 12255.50] is that a lot
[12255.50 → 12256.44] of badminton equipment
[12256.44 → 12257.50] tends to be designed
[12257.50 → 12258.44] more for
[12258.44 → 12260.52] an Asian audience.
[12260.76 → 12261.24] So,
[12261.34 → 12261.84] my shoes,
[12261.96 → 12262.50] for example,
[12263.18 → 12263.58] are,
[12263.74 → 12265.60] I have to get
[12265.60 → 12266.00] the
[12266.08 → 12266.60] whatever,
[12267.26 → 12268.66] whatever the wide
[12268.66 → 12270.28] version of the
[12270.36 → 12271.02] I think it's like
[12271.02 → 12272.34] the 65
[12272.34 → 12275.20] something W shoe
[12275.20 → 12276.42] or something like that.
[12278.10 → 12278.54] Yeah,
[12278.68 → 12278.98] it's a
[12278.98 → 12279.56] it's a something.
[12279.56 → 12280.34] It's a Yonex
[12280.34 → 12282.78] SHB 65W
[12282.78 → 12283.54] or something like that.
[12283.58 → 12284.38] It's discontinued,
[12284.48 → 12286.06] but I still wear it
[12286.06 → 12287.10] because I bought,
[12287.28 → 12287.34] like,
[12287.40 → 12288.24] six of them
[12288.24 → 12289.32] because they
[12289.32 → 12290.44] discontinued their
[12290.44 → 12291.06] wide model
[12291.06 → 12291.80] for a while.
[12292.34 → 12292.60] Yeah,
[12292.62 → 12293.40] I think it's this one.
[12293.82 → 12295.00] They discontinued
[12295.00 → 12295.84] their wide model
[12295.84 → 12297.28] in one generation.
[12297.28 → 12297.76] I was like,
[12297.84 → 12298.44] you guys don't have
[12298.44 → 12299.14] a wide shoe anymore.
[12299.22 → 12299.90] This is ridiculous.
[12300.22 → 12300.84] And then when they
[12300.84 → 12301.60] brought it back,
[12301.62 → 12302.12] I was like,
[12302.18 → 12302.54] okay,
[12303.00 → 12303.36] well,
[12303.44 → 12304.38] I'm going to stock up
[12304.38 → 12305.18] on them so that
[12305.18 → 12306.62] I never have to worry
[12306.62 → 12307.30] about that again.
[12307.30 → 12307.98] And I've actually
[12307.98 → 12308.42] gone through
[12308.42 → 12309.24] like four of them
[12309.24 → 12309.50] already.
[12309.50 → 12310.16] So I'm down to,
[12310.24 → 12311.14] I'm down to two more.
[12311.32 → 12312.22] And then I actually
[12312.22 → 12313.24] just switched rackets.
[12313.56 → 12314.48] I just switched
[12314.48 → 12316.48] to the Nanofibre 700
[12316.48 → 12317.82] 4U.
[12318.58 → 12319.40] The 5U
[12319.40 → 12320.50] is super cool,
[12320.90 → 12323.16] which it's like
[12323.16 → 12323.46] super,
[12323.58 → 12324.02] super light.
[12324.12 → 12324.60] And I like that
[12324.60 → 12324.96] about it.
[12325.04 → 12325.56] But the
[12325.64 → 12326.94] this one is not
[12326.94 → 12328.44] Nanofibre 700.
[12328.64 → 12329.14] What a name.
[12329.28 → 12329.40] Yeah,
[12329.40 → 12330.82] this is not as fragile.
[12331.30 → 12331.44] Yeah.
[12331.44 → 12332.74] So there you go.
[12332.84 → 12333.44] And I'm,
[12333.44 → 12334.82] I'm partial to hang
[12334.82 → 12336.00] you a tournament
[12336.00 → 12336.88] number one shuttlecocks.
[12337.32 → 12338.32] There you go.
[12341.84 → 12343.60] But when deciding
[12343.60 → 12344.50] whether to make a new
[12344.50 → 12345.62] video and especially
[12345.62 → 12346.60] a new video that is
[12346.60 → 12347.52] different from existing
[12347.52 → 12348.14] series,
[12348.28 → 12349.30] do you have,
[12349.64 → 12349.78] Oh,
[12350.06 → 12350.54] Oh,
[12350.72 → 12350.82] I,
[12351.02 → 12351.20] sorry.
[12351.28 → 12351.94] I left something out.
[12351.98 → 12352.94] I use BG 80 strings,
[12352.94 → 12353.64] but I might need to
[12353.64 → 12354.26] switch because they're
[12354.26 → 12356.22] really delicate and I
[12356.22 → 12357.00] keep breaking them
[12357.00 → 12357.80] because I miss it at the
[12357.80 → 12358.68] top of my racket a lot
[12358.68 → 12359.94] because I'm dumb and I
[12359.94 → 12360.78] use too much arm and
[12360.78 → 12361.38] not enough wrist.
[12362.00 → 12362.46] There you go.
[12362.92 → 12363.72] Basically more detail
[12363.72 → 12364.42] than most people need.
[12364.44 → 12365.20] Do you trust your
[12365.20 → 12366.22] experience or instinct
[12366.22 → 12366.66] when,
[12366.78 → 12367.78] when deciding to jump
[12367.78 → 12368.44] into like a new
[12368.44 → 12368.92] category,
[12369.02 → 12369.70] new type of video
[12369.70 → 12370.02] that you haven't
[12370.02 → 12370.44] made before?
[12370.54 → 12371.14] It's got to be both.
[12371.42 → 12371.70] I mean,
[12371.70 → 12372.30] they're inseparable
[12372.30 → 12372.74] for me.
[12372.84 → 12373.70] So much of my
[12373.70 → 12374.44] instinct is.
[12374.52 → 12374.58] no,
[12374.64 → 12374.72] no,
[12374.76 → 12375.68] compared to like
[12375.68 → 12376.36] having a scoring
[12376.36 → 12376.84] system.
[12376.96 → 12377.98] A scoring system.
[12378.14 → 12378.28] Yeah.
[12378.46 → 12379.20] Systematic score.
[12379.32 → 12379.86] I have no idea.
[12380.14 → 12380.32] Yeah,
[12380.38 → 12380.62] no,
[12380.72 → 12381.02] uh,
[12381.02 → 12381.26] it's,
[12381.32 → 12382.18] it's experience and
[12382.18 → 12382.66] instinct.
[12383.10 → 12383.42] Um,
[12383.42 → 12383.94] obviously,
[12384.14 → 12384.36] you know,
[12384.36 → 12384.62] we,
[12384.76 → 12386.22] we will discuss things.
[12386.22 → 12386.80] I don't just make
[12386.80 → 12387.72] unilateral decisions,
[12387.72 → 12389.50] but we are,
[12389.90 → 12390.14] man,
[12390.14 → 12390.72] when it comes to
[12390.72 → 12391.36] creativity,
[12391.36 → 12392.20] you can't,
[12392.20 → 12393.22] you can't just score
[12393.22 → 12393.72] things.
[12394.02 → 12394.50] Yeah.
[12394.74 → 12395.78] Like you can rank them.
[12395.86 → 12396.38] You could go,
[12396.50 → 12396.64] okay,
[12396.66 → 12397.68] here are three ideas.
[12397.92 → 12398.38] Good,
[12398.46 → 12398.64] better,
[12398.72 → 12399.00] best,
[12399.10 → 12399.34] right?
[12399.68 → 12400.04] Good,
[12400.34 → 12400.46] better,
[12400.54 → 12400.80] best.
[12400.92 → 12402.12] But I don't think
[12402.12 → 12403.08] you can just quantify
[12403.08 → 12403.82] that stuff.
[12404.78 → 12406.02] There also might be
[12406.02 → 12407.48] a worth in making
[12407.48 → 12408.66] a certain video
[12408.66 → 12410.02] that is not super
[12410.02 → 12410.42] tangible.
[12410.94 → 12411.46] Yeah.
[12411.46 → 12412.42] We make videos
[12412.42 → 12413.80] regularly that we
[12413.80 → 12414.48] know are not
[12414.48 → 12415.42] necessarily going to
[12415.42 → 12416.22] perform the best
[12416.22 → 12417.46] or be the
[12417.46 → 12418.66] the lowest cost
[12418.66 → 12419.40] for the highest
[12419.40 → 12420.22] return in terms
[12420.22 → 12420.62] of views
[12420.62 → 12421.16] or sponsorship
[12421.16 → 12421.72] dollars or
[12421.72 → 12422.28] whatever else.
[12422.64 → 12422.92] Uh,
[12422.92 → 12423.78] but you know,
[12423.82 → 12424.38] for us,
[12424.40 → 12424.64] it's,
[12424.70 → 12425.24] it's also,
[12425.82 → 12426.80] it's a long game,
[12426.84 → 12427.04] right?
[12427.04 → 12429.34] So we might invest
[12429.34 → 12430.12] a ton of time
[12430.12 → 12430.58] and money
[12430.58 → 12431.98] in having labs
[12431.98 → 12433.02] test some product
[12433.02 → 12433.94] that we know
[12433.94 → 12434.82] is going to perform
[12434.82 → 12436.24] mediocre at best
[12436.24 → 12436.84] as a video
[12436.84 → 12437.98] when I could just
[12437.98 → 12439.60] react to crazy
[12439.60 → 12440.50] gaming setups
[12440.50 → 12441.28] and sit in front
[12441.28 → 12441.70] of a camera
[12441.70 → 12443.50] for like 50 minutes
[12443.50 → 12444.70] and bang out a video
[12444.70 → 12445.28] that'll do twice
[12445.28 → 12445.86] as many views.
[12446.00 → 12446.72] But the reason
[12446.72 → 12447.30] we do that
[12447.30 → 12448.22] is because you guys
[12448.22 → 12448.80] wouldn't care
[12448.80 → 12449.52] about me reacting
[12449.52 → 12450.12] to computers
[12450.12 → 12450.70] unless we were
[12450.70 → 12451.28] also,
[12451.28 → 12452.06] uh,
[12452.18 → 12453.14] a reliable,
[12453.38 → 12454.06] valuable source
[12454.06 → 12454.64] of information
[12454.64 → 12455.66] about these products
[12455.66 → 12456.76] that you might
[12456.76 → 12457.64] actually buy
[12457.64 → 12458.36] as opposed to
[12458.36 → 12458.82] the ones that
[12458.82 → 12459.40] you just like
[12459.40 → 12460.22] looking at funny
[12460.22 → 12460.84] videos about.
[12464.02 → 12464.50] Uh,
[12464.62 → 12465.56] Joseph asks,
[12465.68 → 12466.06] first time
[12466.06 → 12466.70] merch message,
[12467.10 → 12467.86] I was just curious
[12467.86 → 12468.80] if there's any
[12468.80 → 12469.52] companies,
[12470.22 → 12470.98] either tech
[12470.98 → 12471.76] or not,
[12471.84 → 12472.70] that you would
[12472.70 → 12473.68] like to see
[12473.68 → 12474.44] fail.
[12474.44 → 12476.88] is there anyone
[12476.88 → 12477.82] that you just
[12477.82 → 12479.68] think the world
[12479.68 → 12480.56] would be better
[12480.56 → 12481.18] off without?
[12481.18 → 12481.68] There's a lot.
[12482.26 → 12482.70] Okay.
[12482.70 → 12483.44] There are tons.
[12483.86 → 12484.28] Okay.
[12485.14 → 12485.66] Amazon.
[12486.36 → 12486.92] Really?
[12487.20 → 12487.66] Fail.
[12487.78 → 12488.12] Walmart.
[12489.08 → 12489.52] Okay.
[12490.34 → 12490.82] Uh,
[12491.24 → 12492.70] name other things
[12492.70 → 12493.30] that are similar
[12493.30 → 12493.78] to that.
[12494.14 → 12495.14] Gigantic big box
[12495.14 → 12495.44] stores.
[12495.62 → 12495.88] Okay,
[12496.16 → 12496.94] hold on a second.
[12497.28 → 12497.90] What about
[12497.90 → 12498.74] someone like a Google?
[12499.32 → 12500.14] Would you rather
[12500.14 → 12501.10] see them fail?
[12501.10 → 12501.16] fail.
[12501.16 → 12501.20] fail.
[12501.20 → 12501.22] fail.
[12501.22 → 12501.26] fail.
[12501.26 → 12501.28] fail.
[12501.28 → 12501.30] fail.
[12501.30 → 12501.66] fail.
[12501.66 → 12503.16] fail.
[12503.16 → 12503.22] fail.
[12503.22 → 12504.22] fail.
[12504.44 → 12504.90] fail.
[12509.38 → 12509.86] No.
[12513.14 → 12514.00] I think no.
[12516.34 → 12516.82] And,
[12516.96 → 12517.94] Amazon,
[12518.44 → 12519.28] when I'm saying
[12519.28 → 12519.70] Amazon,
[12519.96 → 12520.42] I'm saying
[12520.42 → 12521.14] what I think
[12521.14 → 12522.04] most people,
[12522.24 → 12522.92] maybe not in this
[12522.92 → 12523.20] audience,
[12523.62 → 12524.16] but what I think
[12524.16 → 12524.80] most people would
[12524.80 → 12525.52] imagine when they
[12525.52 → 12526.30] think of Amazon,
[12526.78 → 12527.64] which is like
[12527.64 → 12528.62] amazon.com.
[12530.10 → 12531.10] Not necessarily
[12531.10 → 12531.76] some of the other
[12531.76 → 12532.40] things that they do.
[12532.96 → 12533.44] Interesting.
[12533.68 → 12533.90] Okay,
[12534.12 → 12534.34] sure.
[12534.34 → 12534.92] Like AWS.
[12536.84 → 12537.00] I'm,
[12537.06 → 12537.28] I'm,
[12537.28 → 12537.50] I,
[12537.50 → 12537.54] I,
[12537.54 → 12540.00] AWS is not
[12540.00 → 12541.44] in a monopolistic
[12541.44 → 12541.88] position.
[12541.88 → 12542.26] Exactly.
[12542.42 → 12543.00] At this time.
[12543.10 → 12543.22] Yeah.
[12543.80 → 12544.24] Yeah.
[12544.30 → 12544.58] Okay.
[12544.70 → 12545.60] There are competitors.
[12545.76 → 12546.40] There are competitors
[12546.40 → 12547.08] that are legit
[12547.08 → 12547.58] and there are
[12547.58 → 12548.20] competitors that
[12548.20 → 12548.62] are thriving.
[12548.62 → 12549.30] So it's like,
[12549.36 → 12549.58] okay,
[12550.26 → 12550.96] that's right.
[12552.22 → 12553.12] But I don't,
[12553.28 → 12554.32] Amazon.com can,
[12554.32 → 12555.14] can die in a fire.
[12556.38 → 12557.00] All right.
[12557.24 → 12557.50] Yeah.
[12557.88 → 12558.32] Man,
[12558.32 → 12559.00] I'm having a hard
[12559.00 → 12559.54] time.
[12560.12 → 12560.94] Like Walmart
[12560.94 → 12561.70] can die in a fire.
[12562.66 → 12563.72] I don't need them
[12563.72 → 12563.98] to,
[12564.10 → 12565.12] I don't need them
[12565.12 → 12565.74] to fail.
[12565.82 → 12566.42] I just need them
[12566.42 → 12567.04] to not be as
[12567.04 → 12567.48] dominant.
[12568.48 → 12568.84] Um,
[12569.44 → 12569.92] and like,
[12569.96 → 12570.10] I'm,
[12570.14 → 12570.68] I'm generally
[12570.68 → 12572.26] just pro competition.
[12572.26 → 12573.24] This is like the
[12573.24 → 12574.44] the conversation we're
[12574.44 → 12575.36] having earlier about
[12575.36 → 12575.82] fines.
[12575.82 → 12577.96] my reason for wanting
[12577.96 → 12579.12] these to fail
[12579.12 → 12580.08] is because of the
[12580.08 → 12580.78] damage that they've
[12580.78 → 12581.56] done to other groups.
[12581.68 → 12581.86] Oh,
[12581.96 → 12582.42] I see.
[12582.42 → 12583.18] So I want them to
[12583.18 → 12584.50] actually fail.
[12585.02 → 12585.92] There are other
[12585.92 → 12586.78] things where it's like,
[12586.84 → 12587.22] okay,
[12587.22 → 12589.06] you're winning a little
[12589.06 → 12589.86] bit too hard,
[12590.02 → 12592.46] but you're not like
[12592.46 → 12594.44] horrifically abusing
[12594.44 → 12595.34] your low level
[12595.34 → 12595.92] employees.
[12596.14 → 12596.58] So,
[12596.78 → 12597.12] you know,
[12597.50 → 12598.64] maybe you could do
[12598.64 → 12599.20] not as well.
[12599.36 → 12600.02] That would be great.
[12600.42 → 12600.82] Right.
[12600.96 → 12602.06] But I want those
[12602.06 → 12602.64] ones to fail
[12602.64 → 12603.18] personally.
[12604.72 → 12605.16] Yeah.
[12605.16 → 12607.06] Uh,
[12607.08 → 12607.36] okay.
[12607.46 → 12608.32] We've got just a
[12608.32 → 12608.94] couple more.
[12609.80 → 12610.32] Uh,
[12610.32 → 12610.82] Jared asks,
[12610.90 → 12611.36] what do you think
[12611.36 → 12612.34] about Tesla's not
[12612.34 → 12612.74] being very,
[12612.74 → 12613.56] very friendly in
[12613.56 → 12614.28] regards to owner
[12614.28 → 12614.70] repair?
[12614.84 → 12615.12] Do you think
[12615.12 → 12615.72] electric vehicles
[12615.72 → 12616.14] are going to need
[12616.14 → 12616.62] to be worked on
[12616.62 → 12617.28] by manufacturers
[12617.28 → 12617.78] and dealers?
[12618.04 → 12618.76] I mean,
[12618.80 → 12619.82] we're generally
[12619.82 → 12620.88] pro right to
[12620.88 → 12622.12] repair across the
[12622.12 → 12622.46] board.
[12622.78 → 12623.22] Um,
[12623.34 → 12623.60] and,
[12623.68 → 12624.10] and no,
[12624.22 → 12624.58] I'm,
[12624.64 → 12625.52] I'm not a big
[12625.52 → 12626.78] fan of a lot
[12626.78 → 12628.06] of Tesla's
[12628.06 → 12630.10] way of doing
[12630.10 → 12630.62] business.
[12630.62 → 12630.92] I mean,
[12631.42 → 12631.92] um,
[12631.94 → 12632.32] as,
[12632.46 → 12632.98] as a member
[12632.98 → 12633.54] of the media
[12633.54 → 12634.46] in particular,
[12634.46 → 12635.20] and as
[12635.20 → 12635.68] someone who
[12635.68 → 12636.50] values open
[12636.50 → 12636.88] and honest
[12636.88 → 12637.54] communication,
[12637.54 → 12638.24] um,
[12638.32 → 12639.46] Tesla crossed
[12639.46 → 12640.46] a huge red
[12640.46 → 12641.22] line for me
[12641.22 → 12641.72] when they
[12641.72 → 12642.44] dissolved their
[12642.44 → 12643.10] PR department
[12643.10 → 12643.78] and basically
[12643.78 → 12645.06] decided they
[12645.06 → 12645.38] were just
[12645.38 → 12646.44] not going to
[12646.44 → 12647.30] answer questions
[12647.30 → 12649.20] about anything
[12649.20 → 12650.08] that was
[12650.08 → 12650.86] inconvenient for
[12650.86 → 12651.06] them.
[12651.76 → 12653.40] That's not
[12653.40 → 12654.98] actually cool.
[12655.14 → 12655.94] That's not
[12655.94 → 12657.24] being like a
[12657.24 → 12658.04] Chad or
[12658.04 → 12658.36] whatever.
[12658.50 → 12658.86] That's,
[12659.08 → 12660.40] that's just
[12660.40 → 12661.22] deciding,
[12661.34 → 12661.76] making a
[12661.76 → 12662.46] conscious decision
[12662.46 → 12662.92] to not be
[12662.92 → 12663.38] accountable.
[12664.16 → 12664.52] Um,
[12664.88 → 12665.08] yeah,
[12665.14 → 12665.34] I,
[12665.36 → 12665.88] I don't,
[12665.96 → 12666.62] I don't think
[12666.62 → 12667.16] that a lot
[12667.16 → 12667.72] of what Tesla
[12667.72 → 12668.34] does is,
[12668.46 → 12669.36] is very cool.
[12670.76 → 12671.46] I don't want
[12671.46 → 12672.04] them to fail.
[12672.40 → 12672.64] I,
[12672.84 → 12673.14] you know,
[12673.22 → 12673.30] I,
[12673.50 → 12674.68] overall,
[12674.92 → 12675.08] I,
[12675.16 → 12675.38] I,
[12675.38 → 12676.02] I think they,
[12676.14 → 12676.78] they are a
[12676.78 → 12677.64] force for good
[12677.64 → 12678.70] in the car
[12678.70 → 12679.10] market.
[12679.36 → 12679.66] Uh,
[12679.66 → 12680.34] more competition
[12680.34 → 12680.70] is,
[12680.74 → 12681.28] is generally
[12681.28 → 12681.78] better
[12681.78 → 12682.18] from my
[12682.18 → 12682.62] point of view,
[12682.62 → 12683.62] but I'm,
[12683.62 → 12684.08] I'm not
[12684.08 → 12685.56] a fan.
[12685.56 → 12687.02] Um,
[12687.26 → 12689.70] I haven't
[12689.70 → 12690.14] seen the
[12690.14 → 12690.58] final mouse
[12690.58 → 12691.00] centrepiece
[12691.00 → 12691.40] keyboard
[12691.40 → 12691.84] anonymous,
[12692.34 → 12693.18] uh,
[12693.28 → 12693.84] final mouse
[12693.84 → 12694.64] centrepiece.
[12694.74 → 12695.02] All right,
[12695.08 → 12695.30] fine.
[12695.40 → 12695.76] We'll do
[12695.76 → 12695.98] this.
[12696.06 → 12696.26] We'll do
[12696.26 → 12696.86] this live
[12696.86 → 12698.42] final mouse
[12698.42 → 12699.10] centrepiece.
[12699.18 → 12699.70] Here we go.
[12700.46 → 12701.62] A $350
[12701.62 → 12702.42] keyboard.
[12702.54 → 12703.20] Good gravy.
[12706.00 → 12706.48] What?
[12707.28 → 12707.76] Okay.
[12708.96 → 12709.44] Yeah.
[12709.48 → 12709.98] Where's the
[12709.98 → 12710.80] key caps?
[12711.06 → 12711.70] Am I missing
[12711.70 → 12712.30] something here?
[12712.46 → 12712.72] Wait,
[12712.78 → 12713.02] that was,
[12713.14 → 12713.50] that's the
[12713.50 → 12714.00] whole thing.
[12714.00 → 12715.98] Buy from
[12715.98 → 12716.70] final mouse.
[12716.80 → 12716.92] Okay.
[12716.96 → 12717.54] Now hold on
[12717.54 → 12718.00] just a gosh
[12718.00 → 12718.36] darn minute
[12718.36 → 12718.60] here.
[12718.94 → 12719.60] Get ready
[12719.60 → 12720.06] for the
[12720.06 → 12720.68] impossible.
[12721.08 → 12721.60] It will be
[12721.60 → 12722.32] impossible to
[12722.32 → 12722.92] type on this
[12722.92 → 12723.50] because it has
[12723.50 → 12724.12] no key cap.
[12724.56 → 12724.92] Um,
[12725.42 → 12725.86] how do I,
[12726.28 → 12726.74] that's,
[12726.82 → 12727.18] this is it.
[12727.24 → 12727.56] This is the
[12727.56 → 12728.08] whole page.
[12728.94 → 12729.52] Do you have
[12729.52 → 12729.92] to click,
[12730.04 → 12730.44] get ready for
[12730.44 → 12730.88] the impossible?
[12731.34 → 12731.68] No.
[12732.48 → 12732.88] No,
[12732.92 → 12733.26] I can't
[12733.26 → 12733.54] scroll.
[12734.26 → 12734.66] What is it
[12734.66 → 12734.86] called?
[12734.86 → 12735.14] Sorry.
[12736.20 → 12736.64] Uh,
[12736.90 → 12737.64] final mouse
[12737.64 → 12738.44] centrepiece
[12738.44 → 12738.98] keyboard.
[12742.56 → 12743.00] Interactive
[12743.00 → 12743.62] display
[12743.62 → 12744.28] keyboard.
[12745.80 → 12746.24] Okay.
[12746.30 → 12746.62] So here,
[12746.72 → 12746.98] hold on.
[12747.00 → 12747.36] We found a
[12747.36 → 12747.66] video.
[12748.00 → 12748.78] Official reveal.
[12748.96 → 12749.64] Oh my goodness.
[12749.70 → 12750.24] It's six minutes
[12750.24 → 12750.50] long.
[12751.30 → 12751.72] Um,
[12753.00 → 12753.28] oh,
[12753.34 → 12753.82] I see.
[12755.14 → 12756.04] It has an
[12756.04 → 12757.36] actual display
[12757.36 → 12757.92] under it.
[12758.66 → 12759.10] Is it under
[12759.10 → 12759.36] it?
[12759.98 → 12760.34] Yeah.
[12760.50 → 12760.98] Or are the
[12760.98 → 12761.92] keys displays?
[12762.86 → 12763.26] No,
[12763.32 → 12763.76] I think it's
[12763.76 → 12764.22] under it.
[12764.30 → 12764.70] Because you would
[12764.70 → 12765.40] see the switch
[12765.40 → 12765.72] hardware,
[12765.86 → 12766.18] wouldn't you?
[12766.48 → 12766.62] Uh,
[12766.62 → 12767.00] you do.
[12767.20 → 12767.52] Yeah.
[12767.52 → 12768.02] That's the switch
[12768.02 → 12768.48] hardware right
[12768.48 → 12768.72] there.
[12769.54 → 12770.18] I mean,
[12770.34 → 12771.02] it's surprisingly
[12771.02 → 12771.50] see-through.
[12771.50 → 12772.44] That's pretty
[12772.44 → 12772.84] cool.
[12772.98 → 12773.18] Oh,
[12773.26 → 12773.52] wow.
[12773.62 → 12773.94] They are,
[12774.00 → 12774.50] there are key
[12774.50 → 12774.76] caps.
[12774.84 → 12775.12] They're just
[12775.12 → 12775.84] very clear.
[12776.68 → 12777.08] Okay.
[12777.18 → 12777.94] That's pretty
[12777.94 → 12778.26] neat.
[12778.36 → 12778.80] I don't think
[12778.80 → 12779.26] it's the kind
[12779.26 → 12779.66] of thing that
[12779.66 → 12780.26] I would spend
[12780.26 → 12781.02] real actual
[12781.02 → 12782.38] dollar-doos on,
[12782.50 → 12782.64] but,
[12782.64 → 12783.56] um,
[12783.64 → 12784.16] definitely cool.
[12784.22 → 12784.80] I don't actually
[12784.80 → 12785.82] like that.
[12785.88 → 12786.20] I'm sure
[12786.20 → 12786.60] someone's going
[12786.60 → 12787.14] to have like
[12787.14 → 12787.44] a
[12787.44 → 12788.14] uh,
[12788.14 → 12788.64] a tour
[12788.64 → 12789.60] walkthrough
[12789.60 → 12790.24] that has
[12790.24 → 12790.76] like a really
[12790.76 → 12791.34] cool setup
[12791.34 → 12791.74] with that.
[12791.80 → 12792.06] That's going
[12792.06 → 12792.30] to look
[12792.30 → 12793.14] super sick.
[12793.70 → 12794.10] Yeah.
[12794.20 → 12794.42] I,
[12794.42 → 12795.08] I dim my
[12795.08 → 12796.04] keyboard to
[12796.04 → 12796.44] the lowest
[12796.44 → 12797.06] level because I
[12797.06 → 12797.90] don't need
[12797.90 → 12798.34] the glare,
[12798.78 → 12798.98] but,
[12799.10 → 12799.42] um,
[12799.42 → 12800.74] I mean,
[12801.14 → 12802.04] yeah,
[12802.58 → 12803.76] I'm cool.
[12805.84 → 12806.36] Okay.
[12806.70 → 12807.18] Finally,
[12807.78 → 12808.30] Linus and Luke,
[12808.42 → 12808.90] how do you
[12808.90 → 12809.68] intend to
[12809.68 → 12810.64] differentiate,
[12810.64 → 12812.02] uh,
[12812.08 → 12812.64] okay.
[12813.34 → 12813.62] How do you
[12813.62 → 12813.94] intend to
[12813.94 → 12814.34] differentiate
[12814.34 → 12815.18] LTT labs
[12815.18 → 12815.80] in regard to
[12815.80 → 12816.34] testing when
[12816.34 → 12816.78] compared to
[12816.78 → 12817.28] other review
[12817.28 → 12817.88] sites such
[12817.88 → 12818.66] as ratings?
[12818.88 → 12819.42] That's a
[12819.42 → 12819.98] great question.
[12820.22 → 12820.60] Um,
[12820.84 → 12821.62] the biggest
[12821.62 → 12822.16] way that we
[12822.16 → 12822.54] plan to
[12822.54 → 12823.88] differentiate is
[12823.88 → 12824.78] through breadth
[12824.78 → 12825.26] and depth,
[12825.34 → 12825.52] right?
[12825.54 → 12826.38] Like that's
[12826.38 → 12826.76] what it really
[12826.76 → 12827.56] comes down to
[12827.56 → 12828.88] is we want
[12828.88 → 12829.66] to test more
[12829.66 → 12830.34] categories,
[12830.52 → 12830.68] uh,
[12830.68 → 12831.00] particularly
[12831.00 → 12832.24] more IT
[12832.24 → 12833.02] categories.
[12833.32 → 12834.08] I mean,
[12834.12 → 12834.70] I don't think
[12834.70 → 12835.34] pretty much
[12835.34 → 12836.96] anyone like
[12836.96 → 12838.02] ratings is
[12838.02 → 12839.20] really doing
[12839.20 → 12841.16] a great job
[12841.16 → 12842.54] of database
[12842.54 → 12843.36] like content
[12843.36 → 12844.30] for products
[12844.30 → 12844.78] like power
[12844.78 → 12845.30] supplies.
[12845.54 → 12845.92] Um,
[12846.66 → 12847.24] I think that
[12847.24 → 12848.08] it's underserved
[12848.08 → 12849.48] and so we
[12849.48 → 12849.72] would,
[12849.80 → 12850.44] we would like
[12850.44 → 12850.70] to,
[12850.80 → 12851.30] we'd like to
[12851.30 → 12851.70] step in
[12851.70 → 12852.48] there and
[12852.48 → 12855.82] I fully
[12855.82 → 12856.74] intend to
[12856.74 → 12857.56] continue
[12857.56 → 12858.68] investing in
[12858.68 → 12859.12] the lab
[12859.12 → 12859.98] until we
[12859.98 → 12861.38] are providing
[12861.38 → 12862.04] the most
[12862.04 → 12863.02] possible depth
[12863.02 → 12863.48] in our,
[12863.58 → 12863.84] in our
[12863.84 → 12864.26] coverage.
[12864.44 → 12866.10] So how
[12866.10 → 12866.58] are we going
[12866.58 → 12868.74] to differentiate?
[12868.98 → 12869.16] I mean,
[12869.16 → 12869.46] we're going to
[12869.46 → 12869.76] compete,
[12869.84 → 12870.10] we're going to
[12870.10 → 12870.56] compete hard,
[12870.64 → 12870.84] right?
[12871.10 → 12871.84] Like we want,
[12871.94 → 12872.80] we want to,
[12872.94 → 12874.66] we want to be
[12874.66 → 12875.02] a leader.
[12875.20 → 12875.82] We don't want to,
[12875.88 → 12876.30] we don't want to be
[12876.30 → 12876.90] a follower in the
[12876.90 → 12877.20] space.
[12879.26 → 12879.94] And I think
[12879.94 → 12880.48] that's it.
[12880.94 → 12881.68] Thank you very
[12881.68 → 12882.54] much for tuning
[12882.54 → 12882.80] in.
[12883.12 → 12883.78] We will see you
[12883.78 → 12884.36] again next week.
[12884.36 → 12885.60] same bad
[12885.60 → 12885.98] time,
[12886.38 → 12887.28] same bad
[12887.28 → 12887.98] channel.
[12888.28 → 12888.70] Bye.
[12890.42 → 12891.14] That feels
[12891.14 → 12891.66] short enough,
[12891.76 → 12892.12] isn't it?
[12892.60 → 12893.28] How long was
[12893.28 → 12893.60] that show?
[12893.66 → 12894.16] Three hours and
[12894.16 → 12894.58] 40 minutes.
[12894.72 → 12894.90] Uh,
[12894.94 → 12895.10] yeah,
[12895.16 → 12895.30] that,
[12895.40 → 12896.66] it flew by.
[12896.88 → 12897.14] Yep.
[12898.76 → 12899.54] What a world.
[12900.66 → 12901.46] What a thing.
[12901.46 → 12902.06] Oh,
[12914.26 → 12914.60] the show's
[12914.60 → 12914.98] brought to you
[12914.98 → 12915.54] by Goliath
[12915.54 → 12916.14] Technologies,
[12916.42 → 12916.76] Squarespace,
[12917.24 → 12917.46] and,
[12917.70 → 12917.80] oh,
[12918.38 → 12918.74] balls,
[12918.80 → 12919.14] what was the
[12919.14 → 12919.54] last one?
[12919.76 → 12920.02] It was
[12920.02 → 12920.50] something good,
[12920.80 → 12921.18] I'm sure.
[12921.62 → 12921.96] FreshBooks,
[12922.12 → 12922.46] there we go.
[12922.66 → 12923.08] That makes sense.
[12923.08 → 12923.14] That makes sense.
