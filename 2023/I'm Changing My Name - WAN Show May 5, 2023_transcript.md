[0.00 --> 9.60]  What is up bells and W's and welcome to the WAN show!
[9.80 --> 15.92]  We've got a great show lined up for you guys today, lots of great topics actually, including...
[15.92 --> 21.46]  What? Discord? Discord is taking away the four digit numbers at the end of username?
[22.60 --> 23.86]  How could they do this?
[23.86 --> 27.86]  You can't be Luke number 8,642?
[27.86 --> 33.10]  You know, I was Luke0001 and they took it away from me.
[33.20 --> 33.66]  No way.
[33.70 --> 34.84]  I have no idea why.
[35.56 --> 37.84]  They must have given it to a more important Luke.
[37.94 --> 38.32]  Probably.
[38.60 --> 38.84]  Yeah.
[39.08 --> 39.38]  Rude.
[39.60 --> 40.64]  Probably Luke Wilson.
[41.22 --> 52.10]  In other news, EA is blaming gamers for using high-end hardware on Windows 10 for Star Wars Jedi Survivor performance issues.
[52.10 --> 53.44]  We're going to be getting into that.
[53.52 --> 54.70]  What else we got today?
[54.82 --> 57.46]  That's the one I wanted to talk about.
[57.46 --> 59.02]  And you got wrecked!
[59.04 --> 65.58]  The Pixel Fold was officially announced after, you know, just like every other Pixel device, it was leaked to every...
[65.58 --> 65.86]  Wow.
[66.28 --> 67.02]  It's a folding phone.
[67.32 --> 69.02]  That's a man that wants to replace his phone.
[69.28 --> 75.00]  Also, OBS adds AV1 for YouTube live streams, which is actually huge.
[75.20 --> 75.86]  We'll talk about that.
[76.04 --> 76.80]  Actually huge.
[77.42 --> 80.30]  Not huge, but like we're lying to you.
[80.36 --> 80.84]  Huge.
[81.02 --> 81.82]  Actually huge.
[81.96 --> 82.40]  Huge.
[82.40 --> 82.46]  Huge.
[82.46 --> 82.56]  Huge.
[82.56 --> 82.72]  Huge.
[82.72 --> 83.04]  Huge.
[83.04 --> 83.68]  Huge.
[83.68 --> 83.86]  Huge.
[83.86 --> 83.92]  Huge.
[83.92 --> 84.50]  Huge.
[84.50 --> 84.56]  Huge.
[84.56 --> 84.60]  Huge.
[84.60 --> 85.56]  Huge.
[85.56 --> 85.72]  Huge.
[85.72 --> 86.56]  Huge.
[86.56 --> 87.44]  Huge.
[87.44 --> 87.94]  Huge.
[103.94 --> 104.62]  Huge.
[104.62 --> 109.36]  The show is brought to you today by Hot Wheels Rift Rally, Zoho One, and Squarespace.
[109.80 --> 114.00]  Why don't we jump right into our headline topic, which I completely forget what it is.
[114.30 --> 114.56]  Right.
[114.56 --> 117.00]  Discord. I have to change
[117.00 --> 118.76]  my name! Yeah, me too, I guess.
[118.88 --> 119.40]  This is...
[119.40 --> 122.46]  Okay, let's go through the facts first.
[122.46 --> 124.62]  Okay, our original article
[124.62 --> 126.46]  here is from The Verge, but also from
[126.46 --> 128.72]  Discord themselves. This is not fake news.
[129.30 --> 130.72]  Discord usernames will
[130.72 --> 132.06]  be evolving.
[132.56 --> 134.58]  So instead of Fiby, hashtag
[134.58 --> 136.40]  8936, oh,
[136.56 --> 138.58]  Phoebe probably. Now we're
[138.58 --> 139.74]  going to be Phoebe
[139.74 --> 142.50]  handle, at Phoebe is
[142.50 --> 144.50]  cool, because you are obviously
[144.50 --> 146.40]  not going to get at Phoebe,
[146.66 --> 148.72]  which I think the idea here
[148.72 --> 150.58]  is that it's going to make usernames
[150.58 --> 151.84]  easier to share.
[154.02 --> 154.76]  But we
[154.76 --> 156.58]  know from experience,
[156.74 --> 158.68]  right? The people just camp them and stuff.
[159.02 --> 160.78]  Every creator's name is
[160.78 --> 162.42]  just going to be gone. Yeah,
[162.58 --> 164.62]  up to literally thousands
[164.62 --> 166.74]  of numbers after it. I mean, I
[166.74 --> 168.62]  learned this way back when having
[168.62 --> 170.72]  a good at hotmail.com
[170.72 --> 172.54]  email address was a mark of being
[172.54 --> 174.26]  kind of cool and with it. Oh, yeah.
[174.50 --> 176.92]  I was cool with it.
[178.08 --> 179.10]  And then the same
[179.10 --> 180.90]  thing happened with Gmail. And then the same
[180.90 --> 182.82]  thing happened with Twitter. And now
[182.82 --> 184.88]  they're saying, that seems like a
[184.88 --> 186.60]  good system. Let's follow those.
[186.60 --> 188.48]  We solved that before, but let's
[188.48 --> 190.84]  unsolve it. Let's go back to the just
[190.84 --> 192.60]  at and a string of characters.
[193.04 --> 194.64]  So in theory, I kind of see where
[194.64 --> 196.62]  they're coming from, because as a
[196.62 --> 198.62]  brand new user, there are certain
[198.62 --> 200.62]  aspects of Discord's user
[200.62 --> 202.84]  interface and user experience. He struggles
[202.84 --> 203.88]  with it so much.
[204.84 --> 206.50]  He can literally barely use Discord.
[206.70 --> 208.68]  It's actually very weird, because
[208.68 --> 210.74]  you're usually very good and
[210.74 --> 212.66]  nimble in different user interfaces, and you hit
[212.66 --> 214.94]  Discord, it's just like... There are certain
[214.94 --> 216.70]  things I do find incredibly
[216.70 --> 218.84]  confusing. Like the fact that
[218.84 --> 220.50]  all of your individual
[220.50 --> 222.74]  chats are...
[222.74 --> 224.62]  mixed in with the servers and stuff.
[224.90 --> 226.68]  Yeah, it took me a little while to
[226.68 --> 228.72]  kind of wrap my brain around it, but you haven't seen me
[228.72 --> 230.44]  try to use Discord in quite some time.
[230.56 --> 232.06]  I'm fairly proficient these days.
[232.08 --> 232.44]  Oh, okay.
[232.68 --> 234.58]  And one of the things that was
[234.58 --> 236.70]  a little bit confusing for me was
[236.70 --> 238.50]  the hashtag numbers,
[238.62 --> 240.66]  because I didn't... coming into it
[240.66 --> 242.38]  completely cold, not looking at
[242.38 --> 244.50]  how to Discord guide,
[244.64 --> 246.18]  and not really having anyone
[246.18 --> 248.34]  show me how. I was just sitting there trying to
[248.34 --> 250.74]  set it up, because I think the main reason...
[250.74 --> 252.60]  You needed a tech tip. No, I think the reason
[252.60 --> 254.34]  I got it first was because
[254.34 --> 255.74]  we added a Discord.
[256.58 --> 258.50]  Like, Jake created the LTT Discord.
[258.76 --> 260.16]  Right. And I was like, okay, well, I should
[260.16 --> 261.80]  probably... I guess I should finally use this.
[261.86 --> 264.06]  ...have an account or something. I hadn't really...
[264.06 --> 266.16]  I hadn't really gamed with
[266.16 --> 268.10]  friends in a very long time, like
[268.10 --> 270.20]  since I used Mumble with my group of friends.
[270.38 --> 272.98]  So, I'm like, okay, all this newfangled...
[272.98 --> 274.62]  Yeah, especially when the kids
[274.62 --> 276.64]  were quite young, you were pretty...
[276.64 --> 278.06]  Oh, yeah, they weren't touching it yet.
[278.18 --> 280.50]  Yeah, and you were offline. Yeah, I showed them
[280.50 --> 282.80]  how to use Discord. Like, that came
[282.80 --> 284.44]  way later. And so, this
[284.44 --> 286.72]  hashtag number thing was
[286.72 --> 288.52]  actually a little bit confusing.
[288.86 --> 290.08]  And unless you're copy-pasting,
[291.00 --> 292.32]  it's a little bit harder to remember.
[292.42 --> 294.64]  I mean, obviously, it's not nearly as hard
[294.64 --> 296.86]  as remembering your ICQ number back in the day.
[297.80 --> 298.98]  Yeah, fair enough.
[299.12 --> 300.64]  But, like, I don't know my numbers
[300.64 --> 302.80]  on Discord. But then, here's the thing.
[303.02 --> 304.22]  If the intent here
[304.22 --> 306.52]  is to make things more shareable, make them
[306.52 --> 308.60]  easier to understand, we know that users
[308.60 --> 310.74]  are going to fill their apps with
[310.74 --> 312.48]  special characters and with numbers
[312.48 --> 314.48]  anyway. And we know
[314.48 --> 316.58]  that remembering a four-digit number is
[316.58 --> 318.22]  not actually a huge problem.
[318.26 --> 320.74]  And you can individually change your nickname on every server
[320.74 --> 321.92]  and every chat anyways.
[322.00 --> 324.08]  I mean, Luke... So, just knowing someone's name isn't going to matter.
[324.70 --> 326.34]  Phone numbers here in the lower mainland
[326.34 --> 327.54]  used to be seven numbers.
[327.54 --> 329.26]  Do you know your first
[329.26 --> 331.48]  seven-digit phone number that you ever had?
[331.60 --> 332.38]  Like, your home phone?
[332.88 --> 333.48]  Yes.
[333.48 --> 336.18]  addresses, street addresses
[336.18 --> 338.54]  are five numeric digits
[338.54 --> 339.06]  here.
[339.48 --> 340.58]  Do you remember?
[340.70 --> 340.84]  Yeah.
[340.90 --> 342.12]  The four to five
[342.12 --> 343.14]  number...
[343.14 --> 343.44]  Okay.
[343.70 --> 343.88]  Yeah.
[344.68 --> 346.70]  This is not a huge problem.
[347.42 --> 349.04]  And, okay, again,
[349.08 --> 350.56]  I haven't even gone through the facts here,
[350.68 --> 352.86]  but one of the things that I've seen
[352.86 --> 354.08]  at least speculated...
[354.08 --> 355.50]  We'll get into facts in a second.
[355.60 --> 356.60]  For now, I'm just angry.
[357.56 --> 358.96]  I'm not even angry.
[359.12 --> 359.94]  I just...
[359.94 --> 361.62]  I'm just...
[361.62 --> 362.94]  Like, why?
[363.06 --> 363.34]  Yeah.
[363.56 --> 364.16]  Yeah, I'm just...
[364.16 --> 365.28]  I'm asking why.
[366.90 --> 368.62]  And so, one of the...
[368.62 --> 370.16]  What's a fact here
[370.16 --> 371.92]  is that it's not that hard
[371.92 --> 373.76]  and it's not an unreasonable expectation
[373.76 --> 375.52]  and it's not a new thing
[375.52 --> 376.90]  to expect people to remember
[376.90 --> 378.04]  a four-digit number.
[378.36 --> 380.62]  And that's perfectly fine.
[381.00 --> 383.08]  And so, the fact that you're now changing it
[383.08 --> 385.02]  is going to sow a lot of Discord...
[386.14 --> 387.86]  Ah, very good.
[387.96 --> 388.18]  Ding.
[388.18 --> 388.66]  On the platform.
[388.86 --> 389.20]  Aw, too late.
[389.32 --> 389.50]  Hey!
[389.50 --> 391.64]  All seemingly in the name
[391.64 --> 393.30]  of making it more user-friendly
[393.30 --> 395.24]  in a way that, quite honestly,
[395.60 --> 397.38]  if I go back even further,
[398.64 --> 401.68]  as a non-user of the at system,
[401.94 --> 404.30]  I found extremely confusing
[404.30 --> 406.36]  when I first got set up on Twitter.
[407.46 --> 408.00]  I would...
[408.00 --> 410.38]  Whenever I would read a tweet,
[410.60 --> 414.08]  I would read the at symbol as at.
[414.08 --> 416.56]  So, I'm reading along
[416.56 --> 417.16]  and it's like,
[417.60 --> 418.34]  hey, at Luke,
[418.70 --> 419.68]  something, something, something.
[419.68 --> 421.54]  That's how I would read it.
[422.72 --> 425.02]  I came into Twitter pretty late as well.
[426.60 --> 427.96]  Anyway, let's see.
[428.08 --> 428.50]  Let's see.
[428.62 --> 430.18]  Let's see what their rationale is.
[430.18 --> 430.20]  Were you late on Twitter?
[430.32 --> 430.54]  Really?
[430.70 --> 431.44]  Oh, yeah, super late.
[432.38 --> 433.56]  I basically ignored it.
[433.62 --> 433.90]  I was like,
[433.96 --> 435.60]  I don't feel like dealing with this.
[435.60 --> 436.32]  Wasn't...
[436.32 --> 438.70]  You were definitely on Twitter in 2012.
[439.56 --> 439.88]  Yes.
[440.02 --> 440.78]  Because our first,
[440.82 --> 442.94]  our first back and forth
[442.94 --> 444.40]  direct message interaction
[444.40 --> 444.96]  is hilarious.
[446.04 --> 446.34]  Oh.
[447.02 --> 448.54]  I don't remember this.
[448.88 --> 449.94]  Don't read it.
[450.22 --> 450.62]  Why?
[450.84 --> 451.52]  Read it later.
[451.98 --> 452.76]  Okay, sure.
[454.14 --> 454.52]  I don't know.
[454.52 --> 456.56]  Joined November 2011.
[459.30 --> 460.48]  When did Twitter start?
[462.72 --> 463.20]  2006.
[463.20 --> 463.52]  2006.
[464.60 --> 465.00]  Whoa.
[465.22 --> 465.54]  Right?
[465.74 --> 467.62]  Okay, but did like anyone use it
[467.62 --> 467.94]  at that time?
[467.94 --> 468.66]  Yeah, for sure.
[468.88 --> 469.38]  All right.
[469.54 --> 469.76]  Yeah.
[469.98 --> 471.68]  So, it's really funny
[471.68 --> 473.80]  because I think the only reason
[473.80 --> 474.74]  I started Twitter,
[474.82 --> 475.50]  yeah, and the timing
[475.50 --> 477.38]  seems about right.
[477.76 --> 478.22]  2011?
[478.62 --> 478.78]  Yeah.
[479.00 --> 479.66]  It would have been
[479.66 --> 481.88]  when the LTT channel
[481.88 --> 483.04]  was starting to kind of
[483.04 --> 483.98]  gain some momentum
[483.98 --> 485.36]  and I was looking at it
[485.36 --> 485.86]  going like,
[486.02 --> 487.66]  oh, I should probably have
[487.66 --> 489.32]  some kind of presence online
[489.32 --> 490.80]  other than this.
[490.80 --> 492.72]  and it was probably
[492.72 --> 493.36]  around the time
[493.36 --> 494.58]  that NCIX was starting
[494.58 --> 495.64]  to build up a Twitter presence
[495.64 --> 497.12]  because all of a sudden
[497.12 --> 499.48]  companies being on social media
[499.48 --> 500.48]  was a thing
[500.48 --> 502.24]  so that you could respond
[502.24 --> 503.52]  to people, you know,
[503.64 --> 505.14]  generating hate storms
[505.14 --> 505.98]  complaining about you
[505.98 --> 506.74]  and that sort of thing
[506.74 --> 508.58]  which is still what
[508.58 --> 509.34]  it's used for today
[509.34 --> 510.24]  which is fantastic.
[511.18 --> 512.02]  Okay, so let's go
[512.02 --> 512.82]  through the facts here
[512.82 --> 513.60]  now that I've talked
[513.60 --> 514.78]  through how sort of
[514.78 --> 515.52]  flabbergasting
[515.52 --> 516.58]  I'm finding this.
[516.64 --> 517.32]  I don't know if that's a word.
[517.32 --> 518.54]  Discord has announced
[518.54 --> 519.36]  it will be changing
[519.36 --> 520.56]  its current username system
[520.56 --> 522.08]  which uses a four-digit tag
[522.08 --> 523.64]  to differentiate users
[523.64 --> 524.82]  with the same name.
[525.26 --> 526.22]  This likely means
[526.22 --> 527.28]  that many users
[527.28 --> 528.18]  will have to change
[528.18 --> 529.08]  their usernames
[529.08 --> 531.30]  due to possible duplication.
[531.86 --> 532.66]  And, okay,
[532.92 --> 533.44]  in fairness
[533.44 --> 534.52]  this is another thing
[534.52 --> 535.98]  that is a little bit confusing
[535.98 --> 538.18]  about the four-digit numbers
[538.18 --> 539.26]  is that
[539.26 --> 540.84]  when you are searching
[540.84 --> 541.48]  for someone
[541.48 --> 543.10]  if you don't have
[543.10 --> 543.64]  their digits
[543.64 --> 544.50]  it can bring up
[544.50 --> 546.22]  a lot of garbage results.
[546.22 --> 548.16]  and that's
[548.16 --> 549.38]  that's valid.
[549.92 --> 550.46]  The company will
[550.46 --> 550.98]  prioritize
[550.98 --> 552.62]  long-time users
[552.62 --> 554.02]  in line for name changes
[554.02 --> 555.52]  and users will still
[555.52 --> 556.32]  be able to use
[556.32 --> 557.38]  a non-unique
[557.38 --> 558.54]  screen name
[558.54 --> 559.10]  in addition
[559.10 --> 560.10]  to their username.
[560.64 --> 561.32]  Discord noted
[561.32 --> 562.44]  that while the original
[562.44 --> 563.32]  system was created
[563.32 --> 564.04]  to allow users
[564.04 --> 565.00]  to use whatever name
[565.00 --> 565.52]  they wanted
[565.52 --> 566.74]  the tag system
[566.74 --> 567.46]  was often
[567.46 --> 568.76]  too complicated
[568.76 --> 569.60]  or obscure
[569.60 --> 570.56]  to remember
[570.56 --> 571.64]  causing confusion
[571.64 --> 572.44]  and unnecessary
[572.44 --> 573.72]  difficulty
[573.72 --> 576.18]  finding other users.
[576.22 --> 578.88]  now this is
[578.88 --> 579.54]  huge
[579.54 --> 580.34]  this is a really
[580.34 --> 581.60]  important note
[581.60 --> 582.78]  in our notes here
[582.78 --> 583.80]  of course
[583.80 --> 585.22]  many current
[585.22 --> 586.14]  Discord users
[586.14 --> 587.48]  do not necessarily
[587.48 --> 588.64]  want to be easy
[588.64 --> 589.28]  to find
[589.28 --> 591.04]  this is
[591.04 --> 592.92]  so huge
[592.92 --> 593.70]  in
[593.70 --> 594.26]  on the
[594.26 --> 595.24]  on the one hand
[595.24 --> 596.40]  I can see
[596.40 --> 597.44]  how people having
[597.44 --> 598.72]  MrBeast
[598.72 --> 599.54]  hashtag
[599.54 --> 601.92]  whatever random numbers
[601.92 --> 603.30]  can lead to
[603.30 --> 604.00]  impersonation
[604.00 --> 604.70]  on the platform
[604.70 --> 605.26]  I can see
[605.26 --> 605.70]  how that would
[605.70 --> 606.36]  be a concern
[606.36 --> 607.76]  on the other hand
[607.76 --> 608.84]  for the real
[608.84 --> 609.74]  MrBeast
[609.74 --> 610.52]  if he just
[610.52 --> 611.12]  wants his
[611.12 --> 611.90]  Discord username
[611.90 --> 612.50]  to be
[612.50 --> 613.70]  MrBeast
[613.70 --> 614.32]  and
[614.32 --> 615.50]  not really
[615.50 --> 616.10]  worry about
[616.10 --> 616.80]  people finding
[616.80 --> 617.44]  him that easily
[617.44 --> 618.84]  then he can just
[618.84 --> 619.26]  be
[619.26 --> 620.76]  at MrBeast
[620.76 --> 622.36]  and only people
[622.36 --> 622.80]  who know
[622.80 --> 623.34]  the correct
[623.34 --> 623.96]  four digits
[623.96 --> 624.94]  are going to be
[624.94 --> 625.52]  able to add him
[625.52 --> 626.00]  unless they want
[626.00 --> 626.48]  to just try to
[626.48 --> 627.38]  add every MrBeast
[627.38 --> 628.58]  and I can tell you
[628.58 --> 629.60]  if you randomly
[629.60 --> 630.52]  add Jimmy on Discord
[630.52 --> 631.58]  he's not going to
[631.58 --> 631.96]  add you
[631.96 --> 632.54]  in fact I think
[632.54 --> 633.14]  I had to ping him
[633.14 --> 634.34]  like three or four
[634.34 --> 635.62]  times via other
[635.62 --> 635.94]  means
[635.94 --> 640.44]  another reason
[640.44 --> 641.04]  for the change
[641.04 --> 641.70]  is to make
[641.70 --> 642.54]  Discord's username
[642.54 --> 643.36]  system more
[643.36 --> 644.18]  similar to what
[644.18 --> 645.12]  users are already
[645.12 --> 645.90]  familiar with
[645.90 --> 647.40]  namely from other
[647.40 --> 648.48]  social networks
[648.48 --> 649.94]  especially Twitter
[649.94 --> 651.96]  so our discussion
[651.96 --> 652.66]  question here
[652.66 --> 653.28]  because I think
[653.28 --> 654.10]  I've done all the
[654.10 --> 655.46]  talking and Luke
[655.46 --> 656.88]  has not really
[656.88 --> 657.58]  contributed his
[657.58 --> 658.22]  thoughts too much
[658.22 --> 659.60]  is what is the
[659.60 --> 660.28]  advantage of
[660.28 --> 661.06]  becoming more like
[661.06 --> 661.58]  other social
[661.58 --> 662.34]  platforms here
[662.34 --> 663.12]  is this just them
[663.12 --> 665.34]  chasing broader
[665.34 --> 666.36]  user base so that
[666.36 --> 667.32]  they can continue
[667.32 --> 668.32]  justifying outside
[668.32 --> 669.50]  investment by
[669.50 --> 670.32]  showing growth
[670.32 --> 670.96]  or what are we
[670.96 --> 671.64]  looking at here
[671.64 --> 672.12]  exactly
[672.12 --> 674.26]  I think honestly
[674.26 --> 678.20]  what would you do
[678.20 --> 678.72]  with Discord
[678.72 --> 680.30]  if you owned
[680.30 --> 680.70]  Discord
[680.70 --> 682.48]  I would figure out
[682.48 --> 683.34]  how to just make
[683.34 --> 683.90]  it profitable
[683.90 --> 684.94]  month over month
[684.94 --> 686.08]  and I would enjoy
[686.08 --> 688.30]  just being the
[688.30 --> 689.76]  top voice chat
[689.76 --> 690.74]  thing for gamers
[690.74 --> 691.62]  and a lot of
[691.62 --> 692.84]  non-gamers on the
[692.84 --> 693.52]  entire internet
[693.52 --> 694.86]  I think that if I
[694.86 --> 695.84]  had to try to
[695.84 --> 697.46]  expand outside of
[697.46 --> 698.96]  the gaming crowd
[698.96 --> 700.50]  there is
[700.50 --> 702.16]  there are much
[702.16 --> 703.48]  lower hanging fruit
[703.48 --> 704.30]  or rather much
[704.30 --> 705.14]  more important
[705.14 --> 705.98]  steps that I could
[705.98 --> 706.90]  take than changing
[706.90 --> 708.08]  our username system
[708.08 --> 709.14]  and what I would
[709.14 --> 710.16]  probably want to do
[710.16 --> 710.94]  is I would probably
[710.94 --> 711.74]  want to fork the
[711.74 --> 712.18]  platform
[712.18 --> 714.56]  so I would take
[714.56 --> 715.14]  I would take
[715.14 --> 716.42]  Discord as it is
[716.42 --> 717.94]  and then I would
[717.94 --> 719.22]  leave it pretty much
[719.22 --> 720.08]  as it is
[720.08 --> 721.72]  with meme-y loading
[721.72 --> 722.94]  screens and
[722.94 --> 724.32]  silly cute little
[724.32 --> 725.34]  pig characters
[725.34 --> 726.44]  or whatever they
[726.44 --> 726.90]  are
[726.90 --> 729.60]  and I would
[729.60 --> 730.76]  leave a well
[730.76 --> 731.88]  established username
[731.88 --> 732.56]  system
[732.56 --> 734.12]  you know all the
[734.12 --> 735.12]  all the cool things
[735.12 --> 736.02]  that are great about
[736.02 --> 737.28]  Discord streamer mode
[737.28 --> 738.10]  stuff like that
[738.10 --> 739.12]  I would leave that
[739.12 --> 740.66]  exactly as it is
[740.66 --> 741.84]  and then I would
[741.84 --> 742.88]  take all of the
[742.88 --> 743.78]  underlying code
[743.78 --> 744.80]  all the back end
[744.80 --> 745.64]  and I would
[745.64 --> 746.40]  reskin it
[746.40 --> 748.20]  as Discord pro
[748.20 --> 749.48]  or probably just
[749.48 --> 750.20]  something else
[750.20 --> 750.66]  entirely
[750.66 --> 751.40]  and I'd create a
[751.40 --> 752.40]  professional product
[752.40 --> 753.56]  that is more
[753.56 --> 754.54]  designed for
[754.54 --> 755.76]  you know getting
[755.76 --> 756.58]  your grandma set up
[756.58 --> 757.36]  on so something a
[757.36 --> 757.84]  little bit more
[757.84 --> 758.90]  streamlined where I
[758.90 --> 759.78]  would I would
[759.78 --> 761.02]  borrow from you
[761.02 --> 761.48]  know maybe the
[761.48 --> 762.48]  earlier days of
[762.48 --> 763.88]  Skype for example
[763.88 --> 764.72]  in terms of
[764.72 --> 765.66]  functionality and in
[765.66 --> 766.58]  terms of interface
[766.58 --> 767.50]  but have the whole
[767.50 --> 768.10]  thing run on the
[768.10 --> 768.60]  same background
[768.60 --> 769.50]  on the same
[769.50 --> 769.98]  back end
[769.98 --> 771.00]  because they've
[771.00 --> 772.18]  done a great job
[772.18 --> 773.54]  Discord is almost
[773.54 --> 774.48]  never down
[774.48 --> 775.32]  right
[775.32 --> 776.56]  the voice quality
[776.56 --> 778.24]  is really good
[778.24 --> 779.04]  considering that it's
[779.04 --> 779.80]  a free service
[779.80 --> 781.06]  that's another thing
[781.06 --> 781.92]  is when I create
[781.92 --> 782.82]  my my premium
[782.82 --> 783.70]  or my professional
[783.70 --> 784.58]  product or whatever
[784.58 --> 785.24]  else it is
[785.24 --> 786.08]  you know I'd want
[786.08 --> 786.80]  to figure out
[786.80 --> 787.68]  how to make it
[787.68 --> 788.84]  paid in some way
[788.84 --> 789.36]  I'd want to try
[789.36 --> 790.06]  and generate revenue
[790.06 --> 790.60]  from it
[790.60 --> 792.18]  but like
[792.18 --> 794.04]  man the way that
[794.04 --> 794.90]  you can screen share
[794.90 --> 795.40]  on Discord
[795.40 --> 796.64]  just with very low
[796.64 --> 797.06]  latency
[797.06 --> 798.30]  super cool
[798.30 --> 798.74]  I mean it'd be
[798.74 --> 799.36]  great for all
[799.36 --> 800.06]  kinds of other
[800.06 --> 800.74]  uses be it
[800.74 --> 801.44]  business meetings
[801.44 --> 802.34]  or calling
[802.34 --> 803.22]  overseas relatives
[803.22 --> 803.78]  or wherever
[803.78 --> 804.84]  it's it's just a
[804.84 --> 805.60]  great VoIP platform
[805.60 --> 806.52]  I honestly find it
[806.52 --> 807.56]  a lot more
[807.56 --> 809.08]  generally usable
[809.08 --> 810.10]  than something like
[810.10 --> 811.04]  Slack or Teams
[811.04 --> 812.80]  but it lacks some
[812.80 --> 814.28]  specific like team
[814.28 --> 816.00]  based features
[816.00 --> 817.58]  so like yeah if they
[817.58 --> 819.16]  had more of a
[819.16 --> 820.04]  bit of a feature
[820.04 --> 821.02]  rollout for
[821.02 --> 823.06]  mostly managing
[823.06 --> 823.70]  users
[823.70 --> 824.44]  sure
[824.44 --> 825.14]  in a corporate
[825.14 --> 825.62]  sense
[825.62 --> 826.50]  but other than
[826.50 --> 826.96]  that like the
[826.96 --> 827.74]  channel creation
[827.74 --> 829.20]  I prefer Discord's
[829.20 --> 830.00]  channel creation
[830.00 --> 831.66]  and category
[831.66 --> 832.48]  creation compared
[832.48 --> 833.40]  to Teams or Slack
[833.40 --> 835.28]  by a lot
[835.28 --> 837.24]  like okay so
[837.24 --> 838.12]  you're upset about
[838.12 --> 838.34]  Teams
[838.34 --> 839.24]  on Slack
[839.24 --> 840.42]  I can't create
[840.42 --> 841.58]  categories for people
[841.58 --> 842.68]  really
[842.68 --> 844.68]  I can make
[844.68 --> 845.40]  private channels
[845.40 --> 846.10]  so they don't see
[846.10 --> 846.92]  them and then I
[846.92 --> 847.76]  can invite specific
[847.76 --> 848.64]  teams or specific
[848.64 --> 849.48]  people to the
[849.48 --> 850.08]  private channels
[850.08 --> 850.64]  so it's just
[850.64 --> 851.76]  tedious for no
[851.76 --> 852.12]  reason
[852.12 --> 852.60]  yes
[852.60 --> 853.52]  so as an admin
[853.52 --> 854.24]  you can't just
[854.24 --> 855.24]  say hey
[855.24 --> 856.58]  all of you work
[856.58 --> 857.60]  on front end
[857.60 --> 859.26]  I put you all in
[859.26 --> 859.56]  here
[859.56 --> 859.92]  go
[859.92 --> 861.00]  so you can to a
[861.00 --> 861.38]  certain degree
[861.38 --> 862.30]  if you make like
[862.30 --> 863.74]  every single channel
[863.74 --> 864.22]  private
[864.22 --> 866.12]  and then you only
[866.12 --> 867.12]  invite certain teams
[867.12 --> 867.56]  to them
[867.56 --> 867.60]  right but if you
[867.60 --> 868.34]  just want to have
[868.34 --> 868.96]  the channels
[868.96 --> 870.06]  and it's just in a
[870.06 --> 870.72]  channel list
[870.72 --> 871.56]  and then you want
[871.56 --> 872.40]  to go okay you
[872.40 --> 873.08]  you and you
[873.08 --> 874.32]  you you and you
[874.32 --> 875.06]  then no matter
[875.06 --> 876.20]  what it's just a
[876.20 --> 876.96]  category called
[876.96 --> 877.88]  channels and it's
[877.88 --> 878.92]  all the dump of all
[878.92 --> 879.44]  the channels that
[879.44 --> 879.68]  you're in
[879.68 --> 880.70]  and then you as the
[880.70 --> 881.82]  individual user need
[881.82 --> 882.86]  to create categories
[882.86 --> 884.90]  and sort them like
[884.90 --> 886.16]  that maybe someone
[886.16 --> 886.90]  has found a way
[886.90 --> 887.88]  around this the
[887.88 --> 890.30]  last time um the
[890.30 --> 891.62]  last time that I
[891.62 --> 893.58]  tried to figure this
[893.58 --> 894.40]  out the official
[894.40 --> 895.50]  answer online was
[895.50 --> 896.28]  like yeah it's up to
[896.28 --> 897.12]  the individual user
[897.12 --> 897.88]  it's great everyone
[897.88 --> 898.58]  can organize it the
[898.58 --> 899.22]  way they want I'm
[899.22 --> 900.94]  like no no no one
[900.94 --> 901.96]  has ever asked for
[901.96 --> 903.92]  that people well no
[903.92 --> 905.26]  users might the
[905.26 --> 906.66]  problem is and I'm
[906.66 --> 908.02]  sure that uh Luke
[908.02 --> 909.48]  and Dan can speak
[909.48 --> 911.72]  to this ah users
[911.72 --> 912.60]  will not organize
[912.60 --> 914.16]  it well yeah they
[914.16 --> 915.50]  will do it wrong no
[915.50 --> 917.32]  offense users but I
[917.32 --> 918.00]  know that you guys
[918.00 --> 918.64]  have experienced
[918.64 --> 919.72]  people coming up
[919.72 --> 920.32]  with their own
[920.32 --> 921.80]  systems for organizing
[921.80 --> 923.06]  passwords for example
[923.06 --> 923.78]  as you've been going
[923.78 --> 924.48]  through and doing the
[924.48 --> 926.40]  audit did they do a
[926.40 --> 931.22]  good job no no not
[931.22 --> 932.66]  even slightly there's
[932.66 --> 933.64]  so it's it's actually
[933.64 --> 935.46]  stunning like how
[935.46 --> 936.62]  many individual days
[936.62 --> 937.66]  go by where there
[937.66 --> 938.50]  is at least one
[938.50 --> 939.50]  thing that we find
[939.50 --> 940.34]  that is just like
[940.34 --> 944.02]  holy crap how did
[944.02 --> 945.44]  this possibly happen
[945.44 --> 947.24]  um it's it's kind
[947.24 --> 948.40]  of it's kind of wild
[948.40 --> 949.42]  and we love our team
[949.42 --> 951.54]  world class I feel
[951.54 --> 953.06]  world class I feel
[953.06 --> 953.68]  and I could be
[953.68 --> 954.90]  completely wrong and
[954.90 --> 955.60]  maybe I'm a big
[955.60 --> 957.30]  dumb dumb I feel like
[957.30 --> 958.50]  it's a p.m.
[959.14 --> 959.92]  that's just trying to
[959.92 --> 960.54]  make a splash
[960.54 --> 963.62]  really the discord
[963.62 --> 964.52]  thing what's the
[964.52 --> 966.64]  point hmm does
[966.64 --> 967.68]  anyone really
[967.68 --> 968.48]  complain about the
[968.48 --> 971.28]  numbers I found it
[971.28 --> 973.08]  confusing at first
[973.08 --> 974.42]  and they did say
[974.42 --> 975.26]  there the argument
[975.26 --> 975.98]  that I saw I don't
[975.98 --> 976.30]  know if it was
[976.30 --> 976.94]  technically from them
[976.94 --> 977.44]  or not so I
[977.44 --> 978.12]  shouldn't say they
[978.12 --> 979.90]  did say but the
[979.90 --> 980.62]  argument that I saw
[980.62 --> 981.22]  was that they are
[981.22 --> 982.00]  trying to fall in
[982.00 --> 982.98]  line with the
[982.98 --> 984.02]  average setup that
[984.02 --> 984.84]  other platforms do
[984.84 --> 986.50]  which seems mostly
[986.50 --> 988.26]  true that is mostly
[988.26 --> 989.00]  what other platforms
[989.00 --> 990.16]  do right I think
[990.16 --> 990.74]  sort of I don't
[990.74 --> 991.44]  think Facebook has
[991.44 --> 994.14]  an at and Facebook
[994.14 --> 995.56]  is yeah like an
[995.56 --> 997.08]  at username okay to
[997.08 --> 998.08]  be completely honest I
[998.08 --> 998.72]  didn't even realize
[998.72 --> 999.48]  they were adding the
[999.48 --> 1000.48]  at at the front yeah
[1000.48 --> 1002.26]  that is weird I meant
[1002.26 --> 1003.52]  like the the number
[1003.52 --> 1004.68]  system after the name
[1004.68 --> 1005.84]  yeah that's odd seems
[1005.84 --> 1006.82]  completely unnecessary
[1006.82 --> 1009.40]  yeah man displaying
[1009.40 --> 1010.32]  that all the time is
[1010.32 --> 1011.00]  just gonna look so
[1011.00 --> 1013.06]  stupid it looks stupid
[1013.06 --> 1014.66]  on Twitter it always
[1014.66 --> 1015.54]  looked stupid on
[1015.54 --> 1016.58]  Twitter we just got
[1016.58 --> 1019.28]  used to it so we're
[1019.28 --> 1021.24]  adopting an arbitrary
[1021.24 --> 1023.88]  meaningless symbol
[1023.88 --> 1026.26]  thing to replace our
[1026.26 --> 1028.26]  arbitrary meaningless
[1028.26 --> 1029.96]  number thing that goes
[1029.96 --> 1030.48]  along with your
[1030.48 --> 1034.12]  username why wow I'm
[1034.12 --> 1035.38]  so much more against
[1035.38 --> 1036.96]  this now I knew you're
[1036.96 --> 1037.88]  talking about the at
[1037.88 --> 1038.52]  earlier but I thought
[1038.52 --> 1039.10]  you're just like off
[1039.10 --> 1044.94]  topic no wow why it's
[1044.94 --> 1046.80]  it's useless it doesn't
[1046.80 --> 1048.68]  provide any value if
[1048.68 --> 1050.16]  every single user has
[1050.16 --> 1051.14]  it yeah then what's the
[1051.14 --> 1052.20]  point this is this is
[1052.20 --> 1053.06]  great so people are
[1053.06 --> 1054.72]  saying look the handles
[1054.72 --> 1055.92]  are going to be hidden
[1055.92 --> 1057.24]  in the same way that the
[1057.24 --> 1058.66]  the numbers are now it's
[1058.66 --> 1059.20]  just gonna show you
[1059.20 --> 1060.76]  display name which is
[1060.76 --> 1063.34]  fine because it is
[1063.34 --> 1064.66]  gonna just not matter
[1064.66 --> 1066.18]  now in the same way that
[1066.18 --> 1067.20]  it just didn't matter
[1067.20 --> 1069.70]  already and the amount
[1069.70 --> 1072.72]  of just man remember
[1072.72 --> 1074.08]  when we migrated float
[1074.08 --> 1075.72]  plane from the forum to
[1075.72 --> 1076.98]  the dedicated site yes
[1076.98 --> 1080.44]  asking a user to go into
[1080.44 --> 1081.90]  their account and do
[1081.90 --> 1084.22]  anything you might as
[1084.22 --> 1085.68]  well ask them to move the
[1085.68 --> 1087.40]  moon for you and I don't
[1087.40 --> 1088.96]  mean that users are bad
[1088.96 --> 1090.92]  people or they're lazy I
[1090.92 --> 1092.20]  just mean they have a
[1092.20 --> 1094.34]  life and they have other
[1094.34 --> 1096.02]  stuff to do and for a lot
[1096.02 --> 1097.30]  of people going in and
[1097.30 --> 1098.84]  micromanaging their profile
[1098.84 --> 1100.68]  and picking usernames is not
[1100.68 --> 1101.88]  real high up on their
[1101.88 --> 1103.70]  list of cool fun things
[1103.70 --> 1104.82]  that I want to do when
[1104.82 --> 1106.86]  I've got you know 45
[1106.86 --> 1108.38]  minutes of earned game
[1108.38 --> 1109.38]  time because I played
[1109.38 --> 1110.98]  piano and it's time to
[1110.98 --> 1111.96]  play games that's not
[1111.96 --> 1112.92]  real high up on their
[1112.92 --> 1113.68]  list of what they want to
[1113.68 --> 1114.38]  do they want to open
[1114.38 --> 1116.16]  their game and start
[1116.16 --> 1119.48]  playing I'm gonna build
[1119.48 --> 1121.00]  this tree hut in
[1121.00 --> 1122.66]  Minecraft okay I played
[1122.66 --> 1124.28]  an hour and 45 minutes
[1124.28 --> 1125.18]  or whatever what did you
[1125.18 --> 1125.98]  say you have you have
[1125.98 --> 1126.88]  45 minutes of game time
[1126.88 --> 1127.68]  so I played an hour and a
[1127.68 --> 1130.60]  half of piano I deserve
[1130.60 --> 1131.98]  to cut this tree down
[1131.98 --> 1135.56]  with Bob yeah so it's
[1135.56 --> 1136.28]  really it's really
[1136.28 --> 1137.38]  frustrating it's just kind
[1137.38 --> 1140.06]  of stupid and I I don't
[1140.06 --> 1141.84]  I don't I don't understand
[1141.84 --> 1142.70]  why and I think we can
[1142.70 --> 1144.92]  just move on things I do
[1144.92 --> 1146.30]  understand why this is
[1146.30 --> 1149.66]  exciting OBS just added
[1149.66 --> 1151.58]  AV1 support for YouTube
[1151.58 --> 1152.84]  live streams this is super
[1152.84 --> 1155.22]  cool it's happening want to
[1155.22 --> 1155.88]  talk us through this one
[1155.88 --> 1158.30]  yeah so OBS studios 29.1
[1158.30 --> 1159.54]  update supports streaming
[1159.54 --> 1161.56]  to YouTube using the AV1
[1161.56 --> 1162.84]  encoder streaming with
[1162.84 --> 1164.56]  AV1 results in boosted
[1164.56 --> 1166.32]  image quality and bit
[1166.32 --> 1168.66]  rate that can be reduced
[1168.66 --> 1171.78]  by up to and bit rate
[1171.78 --> 1172.70]  that can be reduced by up
[1172.70 --> 1173.72]  to 40 percent without
[1173.72 --> 1175.04]  sacrificing image quality
[1175.04 --> 1175.88]  yeah so you can kind of
[1175.88 --> 1177.20]  pick one yeah you can
[1177.20 --> 1178.30]  keep your bit rate the
[1178.30 --> 1180.06]  same and have better image
[1180.06 --> 1182.22]  quality or you can lower
[1182.22 --> 1183.26]  your bit rate which could
[1183.26 --> 1184.60]  save you on bandwidth costs
[1184.60 --> 1185.92]  or data cap well those are
[1185.92 --> 1187.68]  the same thing could also
[1187.68 --> 1188.90]  make it easier for your
[1188.90 --> 1189.72]  viewers to watch at
[1189.72 --> 1191.10]  original quality I guess
[1191.10 --> 1192.30]  I'm trying to think of
[1192.30 --> 1192.88]  that's that's more
[1192.88 --> 1194.10]  reverting to the previous
[1194.10 --> 1195.12]  one where you're you're
[1195.12 --> 1196.60]  gaining more quality right
[1196.60 --> 1197.86]  with less bandwidth I think
[1197.86 --> 1198.72]  the main way this is going
[1198.72 --> 1199.78]  to be used which is a
[1199.78 --> 1202.56]  massive win is to achieve
[1202.56 --> 1204.54]  the same amount but with
[1204.54 --> 1206.18]  way less bandwidth yeah and
[1206.18 --> 1208.48]  that's that okay the cynic in
[1208.48 --> 1211.34]  me will go wow good a win
[1211.34 --> 1214.32]  for Amazon I'm sure glad
[1214.32 --> 1215.38]  that they can save money
[1215.38 --> 1216.38]  on all these twitch streams
[1216.38 --> 1218.76]  but this is actually a W for
[1218.76 --> 1220.02]  everybody it is yeah
[1220.02 --> 1223.14]  unnecessary internet bits
[1223.14 --> 1225.66]  unnecessary traffic is
[1225.66 --> 1227.14]  harmful for absolutely
[1227.14 --> 1229.26]  everyone involved it clogs
[1229.26 --> 1231.78]  up the pipes or tubes the
[1231.78 --> 1233.22]  tubes excuse me it's just a
[1233.22 --> 1235.10]  series of no but it as much
[1235.10 --> 1236.38]  as that goo in your tubes is
[1236.38 --> 1238.12]  a stupid analogy and the
[1238.12 --> 1239.80]  internet is not a series of
[1239.80 --> 1242.80]  tubes it's actually not
[1242.80 --> 1245.26]  entirely wrong either yeah
[1245.26 --> 1247.20]  the more data that you have
[1247.20 --> 1248.80]  unnecessarily taking up your
[1248.80 --> 1251.28]  switching capacity the less
[1251.28 --> 1253.56]  data you can deliver more
[1253.56 --> 1255.56]  quickly for everything else
[1255.56 --> 1257.72]  yeah this is a win all around
[1257.72 --> 1259.44]  this is good and it's gonna
[1259.44 --> 1262.10]  cost you maybe a little bit in
[1262.10 --> 1264.54]  terms of encoding and decoding
[1264.54 --> 1267.08]  power consumption that's I think
[1267.08 --> 1270.38]  maybe the the the worst possible
[1270.38 --> 1272.72]  outcome of this but as AV1
[1272.72 --> 1274.08]  hardware encode and decode
[1274.08 --> 1276.00]  becomes far more prevalent over
[1276.00 --> 1277.52]  I'd say probably the next two
[1277.52 --> 1278.96]  years or so especially good
[1278.96 --> 1280.50]  implementations it's gonna be
[1280.50 --> 1283.04]  like kind of on any new product
[1283.04 --> 1284.96]  within about the next 24 months I
[1284.96 --> 1286.88]  would guess this is gonna be
[1286.88 --> 1289.08]  freaking awesome I mean we've
[1289.08 --> 1290.44]  tested it fairly extensively
[1290.44 --> 1292.00]  especially when Intel released
[1292.00 --> 1293.60]  their arc graphics cards and we
[1293.60 --> 1295.28]  found out hey they're the first
[1295.28 --> 1299.08]  ones to deliver a next-gen GPU with
[1299.08 --> 1300.86]  AV1 encoding how does this work
[1300.86 --> 1303.08]  the AV1 encoding felt next-gen no
[1303.08 --> 1304.40]  no real other part of the card
[1304.40 --> 1305.78]  necessarily did but the AV1
[1305.78 --> 1307.66]  coding a hundred percent did a
[1307.66 --> 1309.74]  hundred percent they totally
[1309.74 --> 1311.50]  delivered there another sign in
[1311.50 --> 1313.28]  favor of AV1 approaching mass
[1313.28 --> 1315.24]  adoption is that match rocks video
[1315.24 --> 1317.02]  whose graphics cards are widely used
[1317.02 --> 1318.98]  for workstations video walls and
[1318.98 --> 1321.00]  digital signage has released a new
[1321.00 --> 1322.92]  series of luma graphics cards
[1322.92 --> 1325.50]  powered by Intel's alchemist we're
[1325.50 --> 1326.40]  just talking about this
[1326.40 --> 1328.68]  architecture which includes Intel's
[1328.68 --> 1331.44]  excellent AV1 transcoding ability
[1331.44 --> 1333.46]  makes sense twitch does not
[1333.46 --> 1337.92]  currently support AV1 but I bet on it
[1337.92 --> 1341.64]  coming Dave I mean I guess they had
[1341.64 --> 1343.92]  that source code leak a while back I I
[1343.92 --> 1346.20]  we could we could probably check and
[1346.20 --> 1348.98]  see if there if we were was not very
[1348.98 --> 1350.94]  flavor the month if we were unethical
[1350.94 --> 1352.46]  folks who would download the twitch
[1352.46 --> 1354.56]  source code leak which I am not saying
[1354.56 --> 1356.26]  we are we could look at it and we
[1356.26 --> 1358.14]  could see if maybe they had some early
[1358.14 --> 1360.20]  work on AV1 or something like that
[1360.20 --> 1361.58]  that they were that they were looking
[1361.58 --> 1362.76]  into but yeah you don't want to you
[1362.76 --> 1364.02]  don't want to kick that business they
[1364.02 --> 1365.90]  were definitely working on it at the
[1365.90 --> 1368.28]  time I mean if if not twitch then
[1368.28 --> 1370.54]  certainly Amazon there's no way that
[1370.54 --> 1372.46]  folks like the the team that's working
[1372.46 --> 1376.02]  on Prime Prime Video or Netflix or
[1376.02 --> 1377.50]  YouTube there's no way that they
[1377.50 --> 1379.00]  haven't been working on AV1 because
[1379.00 --> 1381.16]  for years they've been working away at
[1381.16 --> 1383.26]  this standard working on what the
[1383.26 --> 1384.36]  hardware and code and decode
[1384.36 --> 1386.68]  implementations will look like bringing
[1386.68 --> 1389.32]  it to maturity this whole process takes
[1389.32 --> 1392.08]  like just with how big the industry is
[1392.08 --> 1393.64]  and how slow-moving it is now it can
[1393.64 --> 1396.82]  take 10 years I mean how long have we
[1396.82 --> 1398.68]  been trying to move on from H264
[1398.68 --> 1402.34]  because HEVC was one attempt but the
[1402.34 --> 1404.32]  licensing fees and I know there's been
[1404.32 --> 1406.42]  there's been other attempts as well a
[1406.42 --> 1408.04]  huge part of the problem has ended up
[1408.04 --> 1410.34]  being licensing multiple times whereas
[1410.34 --> 1413.34]  AV1 is a game changer because my
[1413.34 --> 1415.48]  understanding is it costs nothing to
[1415.48 --> 1417.34]  implement it still doesn't have the
[1417.34 --> 1420.88]  same licensing setup as H264 I don't
[1420.88 --> 1422.68]  know all the intricate details of the
[1422.68 --> 1424.34]  differences between them but I know
[1424.34 --> 1426.44]  it's not like identical hold on there
[1426.44 --> 1428.04]  might be a fee let me just have a look
[1428.04 --> 1430.44]  here royalty-free standards are not free
[1430.44 --> 1432.94]  of cost and this is blah blah blah okay
[1432.94 --> 1436.84]  so what I do know is that it's much
[1436.84 --> 1438.66]  more appealing and therefore is seeing
[1438.66 --> 1441.16]  much broader adoption than HEVC I know
[1441.16 --> 1443.10]  when I was when I was hanging out down
[1443.10 --> 1444.46]  at NASA which is one of the coolest
[1444.46 --> 1446.78]  things to say ever I was talking to one
[1446.78 --> 1449.34]  of their tech people about video
[1449.34 --> 1451.76]  compression and coding transferring data
[1451.76 --> 1453.00]  all the different complications they have
[1453.00 --> 1454.48]  around that going around the dark side
[1454.48 --> 1456.16]  of the moon going to Mars the data
[1456.16 --> 1457.90]  complications of those different situations
[1457.90 --> 1462.06]  and I asked what about AV1 and they
[1462.06 --> 1465.56]  currently use H264 and they would love to
[1465.56 --> 1467.32]  use AV1 but they're concerned about
[1467.32 --> 1470.56]  licensing issues oh interesting even even at
[1470.56 --> 1472.66]  that level concerned about licensing issues
[1472.66 --> 1477.46]  kind of sucks it would help them a lot
[1477.46 --> 1479.36]  because the amount of stuff that they have
[1479.36 --> 1481.20]  to send back and forth and the fixed pipe
[1481.20 --> 1483.26]  that they have is is a very difficult
[1483.26 --> 1487.46]  equation for them so AV1 apparently has
[1487.46 --> 1489.82]  royalty-free licensing but that doesn't
[1489.82 --> 1492.36]  necessarily mean that there is no cost
[1492.36 --> 1495.00]  so yeah we'll have to we'll have to get you
[1495.00 --> 1496.16]  guys an update on that because I'm
[1496.16 --> 1498.32]  actually kind of interested a squid hominid
[1498.32 --> 1500.46]  over on floatplane chat is saying it'll be a
[1500.46 --> 1502.36]  game changer for twitch once they add AV1
[1502.36 --> 1504.60]  because right now you're hard capped at
[1504.60 --> 1506.46]  six megabit per second and you aren't
[1506.46 --> 1509.14]  guaranteed transcoding so unless you're a
[1509.14 --> 1512.90]  prominent streamer basically the platform
[1512.90 --> 1516.64]  has kind of self-selected itself to be
[1516.64 --> 1518.58]  limited to you know two and a half to
[1518.58 --> 1521.02]  three megabytes per megabit per second
[1521.02 --> 1523.42]  streams unless you're a big deal on the
[1523.42 --> 1525.26]  platform already which hurts discoverability
[1525.26 --> 1527.32]  of small creators because why are you
[1527.32 --> 1529.00]  going to tune in and watch someone playing
[1529.00 --> 1530.62]  this game unless they have an absolutely
[1530.62 --> 1533.14]  electric personality why are you going to
[1533.14 --> 1534.62]  tune in and watch someone play this game
[1534.62 --> 1537.20]  at low craptastic quality when you can tune
[1537.20 --> 1539.24]  into one of the big streamers and it can
[1539.24 --> 1541.64]  look freakin awesome and probably sound
[1541.64 --> 1543.08]  better too I mean the kinds of
[1543.08 --> 1545.80]  compromises you have to make to do to
[1545.80 --> 1547.52]  stream at two and a half three megabit
[1547.52 --> 1549.32]  per second are pretty pretty yucky
[1549.32 --> 1552.38]  AV1 will be able to do 1080p at that and
[1552.38 --> 1555.38]  still look pretty decent I'm excited this
[1555.38 --> 1560.12]  is freakin awesome yeah so
[1560.12 --> 1567.68]  when's float playing to support it we'll
[1567.68 --> 1568.88]  support it eventually it's not in the
[1568.88 --> 1570.98]  cards right now we have some pretty
[1570.98 --> 1571.70]  monster
[1571.70 --> 1574.50]  band with caps on our live streaming last
[1574.50 --> 1574.98]  time I checked
[1574.98 --> 1581.34]  so yeah I don't know we're not working on
[1581.34 --> 1581.78]  it
[1581.78 --> 1586.88]  all right we will work on it eventually
[1586.88 --> 1589.18]  uh we are not working on it right now we
[1589.18 --> 1590.78]  got all this stuff to do now it's the
[1590.78 --> 1592.46]  point in the show is there is I I'm
[1592.46 --> 1594.06]  gonna hijack this no you want to throw
[1594.06 --> 1595.58]  me out of the bus I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1595.58 --> 1597.70]  crawl out of this bus there have been
[1597.70 --> 1600.08]  there's no buses there has been a ton of
[1600.08 --> 1602.34]  updates on the site might not work right
[1602.34 --> 1605.18]  now uh because one of the updates that
[1605.18 --> 1608.72]  we pushed yesterday uh apparently borked
[1608.72 --> 1611.38]  something with live streaming um but we
[1611.38 --> 1614.28]  are working on there's been a yeah it was
[1614.28 --> 1616.50]  it was working yeah we know exactly
[1616.50 --> 1618.12]  what's wrong and we'll have it fixed
[1618.12 --> 1620.18]  very soon can we show some cool stuff
[1620.18 --> 1622.44]  though I mean if it works yeah so
[1622.44 --> 1624.00]  there's there's sub channels so if you
[1624.00 --> 1625.82]  expand to the sidebar you can collapse
[1625.82 --> 1627.20]  the sidebar that's one thing but
[1627.20 --> 1629.16]  there's sub channels now so we click the
[1629.16 --> 1630.48]  little arrow down the bottom left hand
[1630.48 --> 1632.46]  corner which the users can't see because
[1632.46 --> 1634.38]  they're hidden behind us oh you got a
[1634.38 --> 1635.92]  wide in the screen there we go so you
[1635.92 --> 1637.22]  can see all the different sub channels
[1637.22 --> 1639.02]  with their different names and stuff if
[1639.02 --> 1640.24]  you click on there you get to see
[1640.24 --> 1642.12]  Linus's meme face and this is all the
[1642.12 --> 1643.80]  flow plane exclusives a bunch of people
[1643.80 --> 1645.36]  asked for this so we have now added it
[1645.36 --> 1646.50]  you can see the red bar at the bottom
[1646.50 --> 1648.06]  screen we tried to go with like a
[1648.06 --> 1650.60]  float plane light blue but it just
[1650.60 --> 1652.36]  didn't work you can like never see it
[1652.36 --> 1655.76]  so wait wait wait wait we have resume
[1655.76 --> 1657.90]  now yeah so this will pick up where I
[1657.90 --> 1660.48]  left off if I mean if it if it plays
[1660.48 --> 1662.78]  oh are we wow I don't think we've been
[1662.78 --> 1665.42]  this broken in a long time yeah but I
[1665.42 --> 1667.66]  mean like I said we know we know what's
[1667.66 --> 1670.86]  wrong um so what what what set it off
[1670.86 --> 1673.96]  was us going live ah you know what's
[1673.96 --> 1677.56]  really funny Luke do you remember when I
[1677.56 --> 1679.70]  popped into the float plane aquarium I
[1680.36 --> 1682.64]  think yesterday and you guys were telling
[1682.64 --> 1684.40]  me yeah we pushed everything that we
[1684.40 --> 1685.76]  talked about in our meeting yesterday
[1685.76 --> 1688.22]  it's all live and I was like that seems
[1688.22 --> 1689.80]  like a really weird thing to do on a
[1689.80 --> 1691.56]  Thursday afternoon heading into the
[1691.56 --> 1693.36]  weekend and you guys were like
[1693.36 --> 1697.92]  do you remember that yeah we remember
[1697.92 --> 1699.92]  that when's a good day to push you know
[1699.92 --> 1703.18]  Monday good dude nah don't know you
[1703.18 --> 1704.96]  guys normally push Friday just before
[1704.96 --> 1707.82]  WAN show I mean we don't talk with it
[1707.82 --> 1710.68]  okay anywho resume works by the way we've
[1710.68 --> 1712.10]  got some great exclusives on there now
[1712.10 --> 1714.38]  we've got the extras from the NCI
[1714.38 --> 1717.22]  accessor PC build we've got their first
[1717.22 --> 1719.52]  time series with Sarah now so where
[1719.52 --> 1721.72]  people kind of talk about their early
[1721.72 --> 1723.52]  days in the company and react to their
[1723.52 --> 1724.74]  first time on camera those are pretty
[1724.74 --> 1726.04]  cool I've watched a few of those yeah
[1726.04 --> 1727.56]  we've got I think a few is all there
[1727.56 --> 1729.14]  is there's Nick Colton they're very
[1729.14 --> 1731.14]  Sarah so far yeah it's a really good
[1731.14 --> 1733.14]  idea for a series we've also got a
[1733.14 --> 1734.50]  little bit of early access going on
[1734.50 --> 1736.94]  right now I took my PC to geek squad
[1736.94 --> 1740.22]  it looks like we've already fixed it for
[1740.22 --> 1741.62]  the main site and the beta site will
[1741.62 --> 1743.72]  figure itself out soon so yeah they're
[1743.72 --> 1745.16]  on it they'll fix it it's all right
[1745.16 --> 1746.76]  cool so there's another really cool
[1746.76 --> 1748.88]  thing though if I go into my settings
[1748.88 --> 1752.28]  I can change my notifications for each
[1752.28 --> 1754.20]  individual subject per channel now
[1754.76 --> 1758.12]  yeah so there's a there's also the
[1758.12 --> 1759.88]  include email notifications that's going
[1759.88 --> 1761.50]  to change we're going to turn email into
[1761.50 --> 1764.36]  more of like a digest system where you
[1764.36 --> 1766.16]  get an email this can be user selectable
[1766.16 --> 1768.36]  you get an email either once a day or
[1768.36 --> 1770.68]  once a week with like all of the
[1770.68 --> 1772.04]  notifications that would have happened
[1772.04 --> 1774.00]  within that time window the reason why
[1774.00 --> 1775.28]  we want to switch to that is just
[1775.28 --> 1777.46]  because some people might be getting a
[1777.46 --> 1779.50]  lot of notifications and getting a ton of
[1779.50 --> 1782.86]  email is actually like super annoying
[1782.86 --> 1786.64]  so yeah we're doing that but yeah so if
[1786.64 --> 1788.26]  you don't like if you're like no I like
[1788.26 --> 1790.30]  Mac address and tech news I don't want
[1790.30 --> 1791.86]  anything else you can turn off everything
[1791.86 --> 1793.90]  else just leave those on do whatever you
[1793.90 --> 1796.18]  want no problem and then how does this
[1796.18 --> 1798.22]  work I can change my subscription tier now
[1798.22 --> 1800.58]  right so if you click on the channel
[1800.58 --> 1802.30]  again I believe you can do it from here
[1802.30 --> 1803.96]  but you have granted subscriptions so it's
[1803.96 --> 1805.46]  not going to show but if you if you click on
[1805.46 --> 1808.16]  the channel again yeah mm-hmm if it works
[1808.16 --> 1810.86]  click manage subscription over there mm-hmm
[1810.86 --> 1812.86]  and then you can click subscribe on the
[1812.86 --> 1816.88]  tiers that you don't have mmm okay and
[1816.88 --> 1820.68]  then okay yeah it's not going to show for
[1820.68 --> 1822.28]  you because you have granted subscriptions
[1822.28 --> 1824.86]  because this is my channel yeah yeah
[1824.86 --> 1827.46]  anyway oh that also makes sense yeah but
[1827.46 --> 1828.96]  yeah you can you can subscribe you can
[1828.96 --> 1830.86]  change your your subscription to that so
[1830.86 --> 1833.42]  yeah there's been we pushed the the list of
[1833.42 --> 1835.32]  things that we pushed this last week is an
[1835.32 --> 1838.22]  entire page long yeah making up for lost
[1838.22 --> 1840.82]  time yeah a little bit so I mean yeah
[1840.82 --> 1844.08]  maybe we we flew a little close to the sun
[1844.08 --> 1846.70]  broke a little thing in there we didn't
[1846.70 --> 1849.26]  test live streaming I guess which was a bit
[1849.26 --> 1852.50]  of a bit of a miss but it's it is okay
[1852.50 --> 1854.82]  they are on it it's gonna be fixed soon and
[1854.82 --> 1857.20]  honestly the beta site feels amazing right
[1857.20 --> 1858.54]  now if you want to use it go to the main
[1858.54 --> 1860.10]  one because the beta site is broken but the
[1860.10 --> 1863.28]  beta site feels so good that beta fight
[1863.28 --> 1865.50]  that sounds like a great speaking of live
[1865.50 --> 1867.12]  streams I would watch that that's what the
[1867.12 --> 1869.10]  fish do no not the fish I'm talking like
[1869.10 --> 1879.76]  oh my god the beta site feels great one of
[1879.76 --> 1882.52]  our few small issues that we had that we
[1882.52 --> 1884.20]  kind of resolved last night jumped in a
[1884.20 --> 1886.94]  call with dank pods because he uses Safari
[1886.94 --> 1888.92]  for everything and as far as I can tell he
[1888.92 --> 1891.08]  is the only user on the platform that uses
[1891.08 --> 1894.02]  Safari so he's very useful for bug testing
[1894.02 --> 1897.06]  Safari great so we jumped on a call with
[1897.06 --> 1898.76]  him just to like make sure everything was
[1898.76 --> 1903.32]  all good and he also didn't live stream so
[1903.32 --> 1908.40]  it was but yeah we're we have we're gonna
[1908.40 --> 1911.36]  spend like the next week or so kind of bug
[1911.36 --> 1913.16]  testing these types of things and fixing
[1913.16 --> 1916.46]  stuff and then probably hopefully be ready to
[1916.46 --> 1921.08]  send it after that but yeah fantastic now
[1921.08 --> 1923.00]  it's the point in the show where we explain
[1923.00 --> 1925.58]  about merch messages if you guys want to
[1925.58 --> 1928.30]  interact with the show don't send a super
[1928.30 --> 1931.46]  chat don't send a twitch bit or but or
[1931.46 --> 1935.06]  whatever just send a merch message that way
[1935.06 --> 1936.78]  instead of just throwing money into the
[1936.78 --> 1940.14]  ether you can you know have a have your
[1940.14 --> 1942.52]  message pop up in the bottom down here or
[1942.52 --> 1945.02]  maybe Dan will curate it for us to talk
[1945.02 --> 1946.98]  about later on the show when show after
[1946.98 --> 1950.70]  dark or you know maybe it'll just get not
[1950.70 --> 1952.06]  shown at all because you put an
[1952.06 --> 1953.90]  inappropriate word in it and he had to
[1953.90 --> 1956.26]  block it he had to block you I mean it
[1956.26 --> 1958.52]  does it that that definitely does happen
[1958.52 --> 1960.22]  yeah so the way to send a merch message is
[1960.22 --> 1962.20]  you just go to ltdstore.com you check out
[1962.20 --> 1963.58]  any of the great products over there
[1963.58 --> 1966.62]  including some of our new arrivals and in
[1966.62 --> 1969.20]  the checkout you will have the option to
[1969.20 --> 1971.36]  send a merch message what do you want to
[1971.36 --> 1974.12]  see first today do you want to see the new
[1974.12 --> 1975.88]  t-shirt designs that are actually very
[1975.88 --> 1978.04]  exciting and cool and we can finally launch
[1978.04 --> 1980.18]  because our printer is back up and running
[1980.18 --> 1982.94]  again or do you want to see the new mouse
[1982.94 --> 1985.88]  pad called the cyber stats desk pad
[1985.88 --> 1989.62]  cyber stats cyber stats I was gonna say t-shirt
[1989.62 --> 1991.96]  because I always love the t-shirts but
[1991.96 --> 1994.04]  cyber stats sound super cool so let's check
[1994.04 --> 1995.54]  that out all right let's save the most
[1995.54 --> 1999.58]  exciting for Luke for last oh what okay
[1999.58 --> 2002.84]  why do I even ask him anything when I'm
[2002.84 --> 2004.64]  just gonna do the opposite because
[2004.64 --> 2006.70]  otherwise I wouldn't know what he doesn't
[2006.70 --> 2007.42]  want
[2007.42 --> 2013.54]  so we've got three new designs I'm just
[2013.54 --> 2015.14]  gonna head to the store right now because
[2015.14 --> 2017.22]  I don't know what creative fun names we
[2017.22 --> 2021.06]  have for them here they are ah yes we
[2021.06 --> 2025.36]  have a fan t-shirt our hardware hardware
[2025.36 --> 2028.32]  inspired series is back so it's kind of a
[2028.32 --> 2030.36]  fan but also there's like kind of a
[2030.36 --> 2033.00]  planetary thing going on and these are all
[2033.00 --> 2035.92]  printed on our blanks which are flipping
[2035.92 --> 2042.60]  awesome we've also got a new CPU design
[2042.60 --> 2046.92]  okay well that's pretty sick how if I you
[2046.92 --> 2048.98]  know what I probably I probably have seen
[2048.98 --> 2052.14]  this I think I just forget because we
[2052.14 --> 2054.22]  probably looked at it first along oh no
[2054.22 --> 2056.64]  this is sensor oh that's right that's
[2056.64 --> 2058.20]  right right right right this is inspired by
[2058.20 --> 2060.10]  like a camera sensor yeah this is the
[2060.10 --> 2061.64]  light kind of coming in and hitting it
[2061.64 --> 2065.06]  yep yep man this was designed back when
[2065.06 --> 2067.04]  they were still upstairs they didn't even
[2067.04 --> 2069.84]  have their own office yet and then we've
[2069.84 --> 2074.04]  also got the mountain t-shirt
[2074.04 --> 2078.42]  that's cool yeah yeah I'm not saying
[2078.42 --> 2080.84]  there wasn't any Death Star inspiration I
[2080.84 --> 2084.08]  actually just don't know now let's talk
[2084.08 --> 2087.08]  about the cyber stats desk pad it's only
[2087.08 --> 2089.36]  available in one size so it's not quite
[2089.36 --> 2092.04]  the same as all of our well I shouldn't
[2092.04 --> 2093.42]  say all of our as some of our other ones
[2093.42 --> 2094.86]  that are available in a wide variety of
[2094.86 --> 2099.24]  sizes but it's pretty cute it is
[2099.24 --> 2103.12]  chock-full of interesting stats about the
[2103.12 --> 2105.62]  LTT channel so here if you want to take
[2105.62 --> 2108.68]  aside I can point out some of the some of
[2108.68 --> 2112.94]  the things this right here I believe is
[2112.94 --> 2118.04]  our oh crap Sarah told me all of this oh
[2118.04 --> 2122.24]  oh no now I'm able to be heard oh no it's not
[2122.24 --> 2127.28]  labeled oh crap well good luck me I guess I'm
[2127.28 --> 2132.08]  gonna get everything wrong first up I think
[2132.08 --> 2135.68]  this is where people tune in from by
[2135.68 --> 2138.92]  geography and I want to say this is the
[2138.92 --> 2142.34]  US and then this is probably like Canada
[2142.34 --> 2144.00]  Great Britain so this is like all the other
[2144.00 --> 2146.80]  countries yes yes location there's a little
[2146.80 --> 2151.24]  location thing here this is I believe the
[2151.24 --> 2159.04]  waveform of the LTT intro song that's oh oh what
[2159.04 --> 2161.72]  just Luke dang it Luke okay we've got the
[2161.72 --> 2165.38]  WAN show logo LTT logo we've got all the
[2165.38 --> 2170.22]  items from the classic intro nice we've got oh no
[2170.22 --> 2173.00]  what's the chart what is that oh crap why
[2173.00 --> 2174.60]  didn't we put this on the product page I
[2174.60 --> 2179.50]  have no idea I think this is oh no I don't
[2179.50 --> 2182.60]  know this QR code though super cool you go to
[2182.60 --> 2185.10]  the latest oh yeah Luke Luke just tried it it
[2185.10 --> 2187.56]  goes to the latest video that we uploaded to
[2187.56 --> 2191.14]  LTT I made that it was pretty cool oh did they
[2191.14 --> 2193.66]  okay that's very very very sweet and
[2193.66 --> 2198.14]  unfortunately I forget everything else it
[2198.14 --> 2199.70]  should it's we should put it on the product
[2199.70 --> 2201.28]  page yeah we should put that on the product
[2201.28 --> 2203.02]  page we'll do that yeah you guys will get
[2203.02 --> 2204.54]  the you guys will get the cool back
[2204.54 --> 2206.38]  story for it anyway Sarah designed that and
[2206.38 --> 2212.48]  super cute that's sweet all right why don't we
[2212.48 --> 2216.08]  go ahead and start our next oh right we're
[2216.08 --> 2217.52]  supposed to do a couple merch messages Dan
[2217.52 --> 2219.56]  you want to hit us with a couple sure
[2219.56 --> 2223.34]  first one here is from Dave hi DLL big fan of
[2223.34 --> 2225.92]  your show the channels and float plane with
[2225.92 --> 2228.76]  the advent of the ROG ally what other big
[2228.76 --> 2230.38]  tech companies do you think are going to
[2230.38 --> 2232.80]  throw their hat in the ring of handheld gaming
[2232.80 --> 2237.70]  PCs well the second Asus does anything
[2237.70 --> 2241.20]  Gigabyte and MSI will do it so that will
[2241.20 --> 2245.50]  certainly happen man other than that I
[2245.50 --> 2247.96]  would be surprised if Delalienware didn't
[2247.96 --> 2249.96]  have a product like this I mean they showed
[2249.96 --> 2253.46]  one off ages ago it's it's for them it
[2253.46 --> 2254.72]  wouldn't even be coming out of nowhere
[2254.72 --> 2256.30]  have you called them that before yeah
[2256.86 --> 2259.26]  Delalienware yeah I don't think I've heard
[2259.26 --> 2261.64]  that was great I don't think I came up with
[2261.64 --> 2263.76]  it oh really yeah I think that's a thing
[2263.76 --> 2267.16]  first time for me as well Delalienware I like
[2267.16 --> 2269.84]  that a lot I don't know why oh man okay
[2269.84 --> 2272.66]  yeah I I this honestly for a while I've been
[2272.66 --> 2276.02]  expecting it from Delalienware but I think
[2276.02 --> 2278.92]  they might be kind of late but it'll probably
[2278.92 --> 2283.54]  be like solid but late yeah because when
[2283.54 --> 2286.78]  when did they show that thing off Alienware
[2286.78 --> 2288.68]  turned to gaming yeah here's a here's a
[2288.68 --> 2292.20]  video from the verge from over three years
[2292.20 --> 2296.44]  ago CES 2020 where they did a like a like a
[2296.44 --> 2299.72]  Nintendo switch sort of form factor gaming
[2299.72 --> 2304.26]  PC and then Alienware concept nix they
[2304.26 --> 2308.18]  apparently did it again at CES 2022 no what is
[2308.18 --> 2310.46]  this no no that's that's that's something
[2310.46 --> 2313.42]  else entirely so no yeah it's that 2022 it
[2313.42 --> 2317.52]  was the UFO concept so if Del if Delalienware
[2317.52 --> 2319.68]  did it then that wouldn't surprise me at all
[2319.68 --> 2322.66]  and then if they do it you know I think
[2322.66 --> 2324.90]  other tier ones like I would be very
[2324.90 --> 2327.64]  surprised if the Acer's and Lenovo legions
[2327.64 --> 2329.58]  of the world didn't come in and try and
[2329.58 --> 2331.90]  compete in the space because the thing is
[2331.90 --> 2335.40]  I'm actually surprised it's taken this long
[2335.40 --> 2339.24]  if you kind of get what I mean because if
[2339.24 --> 2343.10]  these companies can engineer a laptop yeah
[2343.10 --> 2347.60]  what's the difference it's a lot of like
[2347.60 --> 2351.14]  stuff to jam in there it is but it also
[2351.14 --> 2354.08]  isn't have you opened up a Chromebook
[2354.08 --> 2356.40]  recently yeah but that's a Chromebook it's
[2356.40 --> 2360.08]  not like a this is a Chromebook the whole
[2360.08 --> 2363.76]  things integrated the CPU the GPU but it's
[2363.76 --> 2367.96]  more powerful it's an SOC well powerful
[2367.96 --> 2369.56]  from what standpoint right because we're
[2369.56 --> 2373.12]  talking we're talking like 30 watts oh
[2373.12 --> 2377.12]  wow geez yeah it's nothing so you have as
[2377.12 --> 2379.20]  long as you sort of fundamentally
[2379.20 --> 2381.38]  understand cooling no but I guess what I'm
[2381.38 --> 2382.66]  trying to say is we're talking about
[2382.66 --> 2384.42]  timeline like how did it happen this late
[2384.42 --> 2388.46]  but like technological advancement sure I
[2388.46 --> 2390.34]  mean that's fair enough but I just mean
[2390.34 --> 2392.62]  why are why are they getting blindsided by
[2392.62 --> 2394.80]  the ally why weren't they just the ally
[2394.80 --> 2397.12]  is maybe a little bit surprising to me
[2397.12 --> 2399.28]  the Steam Deck is not because as we've
[2399.28 --> 2400.72]  talked about before it's heavily
[2400.72 --> 2404.06]  subsidized by Steam game sales so you can
[2404.06 --> 2407.38]  kind of make it in an expensive way and
[2407.38 --> 2409.02]  then not very it's it's like how they
[2409.02 --> 2410.78]  used to lose money selling consoles
[2410.78 --> 2413.50]  apparently they still are really yeah I
[2413.50 --> 2416.36]  doubt the PS5 is losing money but I'd be
[2416.36 --> 2417.74]  surprised if they're making money on Xbox
[2417.74 --> 2419.50]  Series S what would be the point in
[2419.50 --> 2423.12]  losing money on a PS5 sell more games I
[2423.12 --> 2425.18]  mean same as same as it always when they
[2425.18 --> 2427.88]  were like stores for three years or
[2427.88 --> 2433.44]  something like I don't know whatever but
[2433.44 --> 2437.88]  yeah I that I don't know I I'm surprised
[2437.88 --> 2439.24]  at the I feel like I'm almost the
[2439.24 --> 2441.42]  opposite I'm not surprised that the other
[2441.42 --> 2443.36]  ones are so late I'm surprised the allies
[2443.36 --> 2447.42]  so early really oh because I didn't expect
[2447.42 --> 2450.04]  another competitor to Steam Deck that is
[2450.04 --> 2452.28]  as good as the ally seems to be this
[2452.28 --> 2454.66]  fast that was very surprising to me well
[2454.66 --> 2457.38]  the Steam Deck was already a generation
[2457.38 --> 2461.02]  behind for CPU tech and RDNA 3 was
[2461.02 --> 2464.66]  already on the horizon for desktop GPUs so
[2464.66 --> 2467.42]  we knew that architecturally AMD had
[2467.42 --> 2469.00]  already laid the groundwork I get that
[2469.00 --> 2470.46]  it's possible I'm just surprised that they
[2470.46 --> 2473.24]  actually reacted that quickly I guess
[2473.24 --> 2474.98]  because this is like a whole new product
[2474.98 --> 2476.74]  segment all this kind of stuff but it's
[2476.74 --> 2478.56]  not that fast like that's the thing I
[2478.56 --> 2479.96]  guess I'm kind of trying to say is how
[2479.96 --> 2481.56]  long ago to the Steam Deck launch is this
[2481.56 --> 2482.96]  like a year back than I thought?
[2482.96 --> 2485.76]  a year anymore yeah because about a year I
[2485.76 --> 2487.46]  think was when they started showing it
[2487.46 --> 2490.44]  one year to create an entirely new
[2490.44 --> 2492.34]  product well that's the thing with
[2492.34 --> 2494.36]  manufacturing and everything like Dell
[2494.36 --> 2496.48]  Alienware ASUS has had their eye on
[2496.48 --> 2497.88]  this for quite a while they've been
[2497.88 --> 2500.92]  working on prototypes on the like in the
[2500.92 --> 2501.66]  back room right?
[2501.66 --> 2502.60]  it's a little over a year older
[2502.60 --> 2505.80]  yeah and and the thing is they're used
[2505.80 --> 2507.40]  to working on that product development
[2507.40 --> 2509.80]  cycle that's the thing okay that's the
[2509.80 --> 2511.20]  part of the puzzle maybe you're missing
[2511.20 --> 2513.30]  here is because Intel launches a new
[2513.30 --> 2516.24]  generation of CPUs every year so
[2516.24 --> 2519.06]  they're iterating start to finish on a
[2519.06 --> 2521.76]  product in a year every time already
[2521.76 --> 2523.12]  yeah yeah and they're doing they're
[2523.12 --> 2525.12]  doing different manufacturing because
[2525.12 --> 2526.66]  they're not yeah yeah that's fair enough
[2526.66 --> 2528.90]  and so anytime they put a new ch
[2528.90 --> 2530.16]  bring a new chassis to market
[2530.16 --> 2532.26]  fast as heck but these companies I
[2532.26 --> 2533.40]  guess are used to dealing with that
[2533.40 --> 2535.80]  that's that's literally their entire
[2535.80 --> 2537.60]  job that makes it to get some
[2537.60 --> 2541.06]  pre-production broken-ass silicon from
[2541.06 --> 2543.98]  Intel and AMD or whoever else kind of go
[2543.98 --> 2546.88]  okay yeah as long as the final product is
[2546.88 --> 2549.40]  somewhat within these thermal and power
[2549.40 --> 2550.96]  specifications we're gonna start
[2550.96 --> 2553.12]  designing around this they do up all the
[2553.12 --> 2555.66]  tooling they get the final they get the
[2555.66 --> 2557.88]  final silicon they build these a handful
[2557.88 --> 2559.68]  of these things to show at trade shows
[2559.68 --> 2561.96]  and then you know two months later they're
[2561.96 --> 2563.56]  rolling off the mass production lines and
[2563.56 --> 2566.18]  they're shipping to customers that's what
[2566.18 --> 2568.88]  they do so it's kind of mind-blowing to me
[2568.88 --> 2572.04]  that MSI doesn't have a companion and
[2572.04 --> 2574.18]  gigabyte doesn't have a they would call
[2574.18 --> 2578.08]  supporter you know our support support
[2578.08 --> 2581.34]  class yeah you know whatever right I I
[2581.34 --> 2583.68]  don't know and maybe they do maybe they
[2583.68 --> 2585.24]  just don't want to tip their hand maybe
[2585.24 --> 2587.10]  they want to see how the ally goes in
[2587.10 --> 2591.24]  typical sort of copycat fashion and you
[2591.24 --> 2592.74]  know if it goes really well that's then
[2592.74 --> 2594.40]  they leapfrog that's the position I feel
[2594.40 --> 2597.34]  like Dell is in I feel like Dell moves
[2597.34 --> 2600.40]  slower on this kind of stuff yes do yet no
[2600.40 --> 2602.18]  I know like they're the first with that
[2602.18 --> 2603.66]  they were the first with an OLED gaming
[2603.66 --> 2608.14]  monitor first mover Dell Alienware yeah but
[2608.14 --> 2611.20]  the like product segment was more stable
[2611.20 --> 2612.94]  they were actually first with an OLED
[2612.94 --> 2615.04]  business monitor as well way back in the
[2615.04 --> 2616.72]  day that was a disaster that product
[2616.72 --> 2619.74]  launch okay well yeah I ordered one
[2619.74 --> 2621.28]  because I they wouldn't send me a review
[2621.28 --> 2622.90]  sample and I was sure I knew why because
[2622.90 --> 2624.90]  it wouldn't get burn in because it was a
[2624.90 --> 2627.80]  very early OLED and so I bought one I was
[2627.80 --> 2629.98]  like okay I'll order your stupid $1200
[2629.98 --> 2631.80]  monitor or whatever even though I really
[2631.80 --> 2634.08]  don't want one and it got broken in
[2634.08 --> 2635.90]  shipping and in the time between me
[2635.90 --> 2638.90]  ordering it and trying to RMA it they
[2638.90 --> 2640.26]  discontinued it and wouldn't send me
[2640.26 --> 2641.94]  another one so I think what happened is
[2641.94 --> 2644.06]  they probably just realized every single
[2644.06 --> 2645.40]  one of these things they sold was going
[2645.40 --> 2648.44]  to come back and just scrapped them
[2648.44 --> 2650.46]  that's kind of brutal yeah that's what I
[2650.46 --> 2651.86]  suspect happened I've never confirmed
[2651.86 --> 2655.44]  that but I'm pretty pretty pretty sus
[2655.44 --> 2657.28]  it's pretty sus that whole thing how
[2657.28 --> 2659.48]  that went down but but no squid hominid
[2659.48 --> 2661.40]  and flow plane shot said going with the
[2661.40 --> 2663.42]  names companion and supporter here is even
[2663.42 --> 2665.06]  funnier if you remember that it was
[2665.06 --> 2669.42]  almost called the steam pal that's
[2669.42 --> 2671.76]  pretty good what I didn't know that
[2671.76 --> 2675.40]  actually oh my gosh I'm I'm still pretty
[2675.40 --> 2678.52]  surprising with steam deck with stream
[2678.52 --> 2681.02]  deck already existing yeah I think I
[2681.02 --> 2683.40]  feel like if anything I accidentally
[2683.40 --> 2685.84]  call this steam deck yeah more than I
[2685.84 --> 2687.44]  accidentally call a steam deck a stream
[2687.44 --> 2691.84]  deck though yeah so valve one yeah oh
[2691.84 --> 2693.74]  they like immediately one it's just kind
[2693.74 --> 2696.20]  of it's surprising because they're so
[2696.20 --> 2698.04]  close like companies usually don't like
[2698.04 --> 2700.70]  touching that much you know all right
[2700.70 --> 2704.34]  hit us again sure thing I heart today's
[2704.34 --> 2707.50]  video about GS I started a local repair
[2707.50 --> 2710.20]  shop with inspiration from LMG one thing
[2710.20 --> 2712.54]  that surprises me was the amount of audio
[2712.54 --> 2714.60]  gear that I see are there any markets that
[2714.60 --> 2720.90]  you reach that you didn't expect oh you know
[2720.90 --> 2724.64]  what not anymore it definitely used to but
[2724.64 --> 2727.34]  these days if anything I'm the one telling
[2727.34 --> 2730.96]  potential partners that we reach an audience
[2730.96 --> 2732.96]  that you probably don't expect I remember
[2732.96 --> 2736.30]  back when we first got in touch with AMD's like
[2736.30 --> 2742.44]  enterprise and server CPU folks so epic they were very hesitant to work with us
[2742.44 --> 2746.88]  assuming that everyone that watches LTT and gamer bros the rest of the channel
[2746.88 --> 2752.44]  yeah the gamer gamer kids or whatever but I mean I I have I have the analytics
[2752.44 --> 2756.72]  right I have the demographics numbers I know that's not true so I basically went
[2756.72 --> 2761.02]  okay so you won't send us a CPU fine I'll just go buy a CPU what do I care so
[2761.02 --> 2764.38]  actually I don't even think we ended up buying one I think Wendell lent us one or
[2764.38 --> 2767.88]  something we got our hands on one somehow it doesn't matter the point is we're
[2767.88 --> 2771.42]  pretty well connected in worst case scenario we open up the purse strings we buy it
[2771.42 --> 2775.70]  right and so we made a video that was just like an episode of holy where we we
[2775.70 --> 2779.14]  checked out I think it was a 32 core like the first epic that we covered was
[2779.14 --> 2783.86]  either 32 or 64 it doesn't matter the point is that it absolutely blew up
[2783.86 --> 2790.56]  definitely registered for them because ever since then they're pretty down to
[2790.56 --> 2795.68]  work with us because I feel like for and and and it's nothing personal because
[2795.68 --> 2800.84]  it's a mistake that anyone could make if your nose is like this close to the
[2800.84 --> 2806.00]  product right you know the strength of it you know how cool epic is and how
[2806.00 --> 2809.90]  disruptive it is from a price to performance to power consumption
[2809.90 --> 2814.76]  standpoint you know all the the advantages and everyone you talk to
[2814.76 --> 2820.00]  literally everyone in your life so your hardware partners your software partners
[2820.00 --> 2826.30]  your cut your your current customers gets it so you kind of go well everyone
[2826.30 --> 2834.94]  must get it then but the reality is that a lot of people work in that industry and
[2834.94 --> 2842.20]  you know what maybe just aren't actually that excited to learn about CPUs maybe what
[2842.20 --> 2847.42]  they actually are excited about and care about in their spare time is wacky cooling
[2847.42 --> 2853.38]  experiments that we do or you know what phone should they buy or how does not to not to keep
[2853.38 --> 2858.46]  bringing them up yeah one of the things that the NASA guys said was that they get inspiration
[2858.46 --> 2864.16]  from watching you just do random stuff seriously and it inspires them to push the envelope in
[2864.16 --> 2868.98]  certain ways okay I take it back I do I am surprised then but like I I was a little bit too
[2868.98 --> 2874.30]  but there was multiple of them saying it yeah and they might not you know they might not do the
[2874.30 --> 2879.46]  exact same thing oh I should certainly hope not but it inspires them to to think in a certain
[2879.46 --> 2884.74]  direction or potentially test certain things out and see how well an implementation or a version of
[2884.74 --> 2888.70]  something that you did or maybe even the same thing might work in their environment that's
[2888.70 --> 2893.22]  hilarious actually like really cool so back to the data center thing though people are tuning in
[2893.22 --> 2898.46]  because they just are excited about technology or they're excited about some kind of technology
[2898.46 --> 2904.74]  and oh holy crap the number of times I've seen this comment it's so cool to see you guys talking
[2904.74 --> 2910.20]  about the thing that I do all the time I never expected you guys to cover this um this is so cool
[2910.20 --> 2915.54]  and I've even seen this one too now I can take this to my like purchasing manager and go hey we should
[2915.54 --> 2919.60]  really look at this because it's got coverage on this huge tech channel and you'll often break it down
[2919.60 --> 2924.30]  into something that that purchasing manager might understand and not just the purchasing manager
[2924.30 --> 2930.06]  their manager yeah like there's I forget how the saying goes but it's like what is it no one ever
[2930.06 --> 2935.28]  got fired for using IBM or something like that no one ever got fired for buying something and it's like
[2935.28 --> 2941.36]  one of those really boring but like predictable companies I'm sure people are going to be going to be
[2941.36 --> 2947.86]  hitting us in the in the chat letting us know like what the expression is but it's like that right and so I
[2947.86 --> 2953.94]  think what AMD figured out is that even among tech savvy people people who are passionate and care
[2953.94 --> 2959.34]  there's influences on them that might not be passionate might not care or might just you know
[2959.34 --> 2965.52]  want to cover their butts right so you know what I've never I've never gotten reprimanded for buying
[2965.52 --> 2971.30]  Intel so I'm just going to keep buying Intel and all of a sudden whoa epic hold on a second what's this
[2971.30 --> 2976.80]  apparently yeah it was IBM apparently Cisco has used like a similar kind of marketing as well yeah exactly
[2976.80 --> 2982.28]  right and so that's one of the things that's really fun and really cool about covering things that we
[2982.28 --> 2988.86]  don't normally cover do we get every single thing right do we hit you know all the do we manage to
[2988.86 --> 2996.62]  communicate all the nuance around the product and its uses do we have a well built out benchmark suite
[2996.62 --> 3004.74]  say for example for you know enterprise machine learning the reality of it is no because so many of
[3004.74 --> 3010.84]  these organizations are using completely custom software anyway before they go and buy 10,000 of them
[3010.84 --> 3015.84]  they're gonna go and they're gonna do their own validation anyway you know for us it's just about
[3015.84 --> 3022.28]  hey this is really cool we're really excited about it and sharing that passion sharing that energy and
[3022.28 --> 3028.12]  so yeah I'm no longer okay I shouldn't say I'm no longer surprised by the kinds of people that watch
[3028.12 --> 3032.82]  us just because they want to share that passion and share that energy and and look for inspiration
[3032.82 --> 3041.14]  um but I am surprised it surprised me yeah I mean but it's like it's very cool and like you gotta
[3041.14 --> 3047.72]  understand it to a certain degree like it sort of makes sense yeah I mean if you're if you're um
[3047.72 --> 3054.32]  if you design cars you know does that mean you just like don't watch top gear yeah because they're
[3054.32 --> 3061.42]  doing silly things that don't make any sense yeah no yeah and yeah you probably know more about
[3061.42 --> 3067.60]  automotive engineering than any of those guys yeah but you don't get to do that yeah you're not
[3067.60 --> 3075.40]  allowed to do that you know what's funny is that's actually kind of the story behind how we ended up
[3075.40 --> 3082.76]  with that 5,000 watt chiller was uh buddy from spacex um oh man I wish I could shout out his name now he
[3082.76 --> 3087.56]  came up and showed me this like cool little led backlit 3d printed sign thing that he does anyway I don't
[3087.56 --> 3091.20]  maybe you guys I think we shouted him out in the video where he actually showed off the chiller
[3091.20 --> 3097.28]  but buddy from spacex is like yeah we ripped this thing out thinking that it was broken we put the
[3097.28 --> 3101.30]  new one in it turns out it wasn't broken at all it was actually like a kinked hose somewhere else in
[3101.30 --> 3109.34]  the line and it would cost more to put it back in now so I got to take it home and I was like
[3109.34 --> 3116.48]  what am I gonna do with this you know what would be fun for me is watching you guys do something
[3116.48 --> 3122.34]  stupid with it yeah like that's sweet so since so since we got it we've uh we've put it on like
[3122.34 --> 3131.68]  a couple different cpus we uh we bios modded a 4090 to accept up to a thousand a thousand watts
[3131.68 --> 3136.84]  like total board power and then we like chilled that thing with it we're gonna use it for all
[3136.84 --> 3143.38]  kinds of all kinds of wild things uh so I guess I I guess I kind of get it yeah but I'm surprised
[3143.38 --> 3148.26]  literal rocket scientists are looking to us for inspiration these guys these guys the the two
[3148.26 --> 3154.96]  guys I was talking to about that in particular were the people that design uh the the mission
[3154.96 --> 3161.14]  control centers oh cool okay so including the like dashboards and stuff that people use and like the
[3161.14 --> 3166.42]  the like quick call control panel thing and like the all that type of stuff so it's like
[3166.42 --> 3174.12]  yeah that's flippant awesome yeah data pipelines for receiving video and and like the the chart that
[3174.12 --> 3179.74]  shows where the iss is going and all this other type of stuff yeah seems like an important chart
[3179.74 --> 3186.08]  yeah yeah yeah yeah where did it come from where did it go where did it come from iss joe joe
[3186.08 --> 3188.08]  yeah
[3188.08 --> 3198.08]  all right two more topics two more topics let's do it you want to pick one yeah ea ea blames gamers
[3198.08 --> 3205.26]  using high-end hardware for star wars performance issues ea man we used to dog on these guys all the
[3205.26 --> 3210.68]  time and then I feel like they were you know they learned to keep their mouths shut yeah activision
[3210.68 --> 3218.84]  blizzard be worse yes and let ubisoft be worse and then they got annoyed you know blizzard bethesda
[3218.84 --> 3224.30]  they're taking too much of the spotlight we got to do something really stupid and now they're back
[3224.30 --> 3230.68]  welcome back let's go ea ea's released a patch for star wars jedi survivor which has been plagued
[3230.68 --> 3237.30]  with performance issues including wildly inconsistent fps massive vram usage broken cut scenes and frequent
[3237.30 --> 3244.12]  crashes before the patch ea released a apology of sorts where it blamed the issue on pc players
[3244.12 --> 3252.24]  using windows 10 on high-end hardware the official statement I'm gonna skip the first paragraph go
[3252.24 --> 3255.46]  right into the second one no I'm not I'm gonna read the whole thing from the start we are aware
[3255.46 --> 3261.88]  that star wars jedi survivor isn't performing to our standards for sure for our percentage of pc for a
[3261.88 --> 3267.70]  percentage great that's very helpful so first you hedge your apology you're not even a full line in
[3267.70 --> 3276.02]  yet yeah come on ea a percentage of pc players in particular those with high-end machines or certain
[3276.02 --> 3283.56]  specific configurations for example players using cutting-edge multi-threaded chip sets designed for
[3283.56 --> 3291.60]  windows 11 were encountering problems on windows 10 or high-end gpus coupled with lower performing
[3291.60 --> 3298.32]  cpus also saw in uh unexpected frame loss now hold on a second I have to stop you right here it's my
[3298.32 --> 3307.20]  fault if I have a cutting-edge high-end cpu but it's also my fault if I don't have a good enough cpu
[3307.20 --> 3315.10]  yes carry on you're doing it wrong whatever way you're doing it you're doing it wrong uh they they
[3315.10 --> 3319.02]  end it with rest assured we are working to address these cases quickly
[3319.02 --> 3329.20]  to be fair to be to be fair they're not blaming the people
[3329.20 --> 3335.58]  they're just saying this is where the problems are occurring and we are fixing it okay but does
[3335.58 --> 3341.62]  it perform great on low-end hardware I think I think it might perform more consistently I think
[3341.62 --> 3346.02]  the problem right now is that you're getting crazy spikes right so the issue then is that they're
[3346.02 --> 3352.42]  just they just didn't validate ultra settings oh yeah I think so because why would anyone do that
[3352.42 --> 3358.82]  and and a very good variety of hardware I think is a big part of the problem you know what's really sad
[3358.82 --> 3366.62]  is the probable result here is we're just not gonna get high-end sliders they're probably gonna look
[3366.62 --> 3371.82]  at this and go you know what it would have been so much easier for us to just cap it out at whatever
[3371.82 --> 3376.96]  the current gen consoles are capable of is it just high quality settings that this is a problem for
[3376.96 --> 3382.76]  that I don't know I don't think so I think it's everything but they're specifically saying the issue is
[3382.76 --> 3389.48]  high-end hardware yeah but they're not saying when put on a high-end setting it's just high-end hardware
[3389.48 --> 3395.98]  wouldn't any why would anyone run it on low though yeah but you can't say like medium is a high-end
[3395.98 --> 3403.00]  setting that's fair and medium is a pretty common thing for people to run stuff on no it's all settings
[3403.00 --> 3409.06]  yeah people are saying it's all settings okay and apparently there's a there's a new patch which is
[3409.06 --> 3414.48]  already helping it I think people were just mad because of the wording of this which it's not worded
[3414.48 --> 3421.60]  great the uh isn't performing to our standards for a percentage of pc players is not a fantastic
[3421.60 --> 3427.84]  way to say that no that's that's uh that's a fine that's like when I ask one of my daughters to
[3427.84 --> 3438.84]  apologize to the other sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly man um so hardware unboxed disputed ea's
[3438.84 --> 3445.46]  conclusion finding that the game ran better not worse on windows 10 and that both 10 and 11 showed
[3445.46 --> 3451.56]  poor cpu usage console gamers were quick to point out that they too were encountering game breaking
[3451.56 --> 3457.54]  bugs and serious frame rate issues this ea blamed on an issue with hdr that was under investigation
[3457.54 --> 3468.26]  at time of writing the game steam rating is mixed at 56 positive uh okay runs like my butt after taco
[3468.26 --> 3475.96]  bell i actually take issue with that your butt probably runs pretty well after taco bell well maybe not
[3475.96 --> 3482.28]  well but very fast it's smooth low latency
[3482.28 --> 3491.74]  oh boy um cool okay moving on we need another topic let's get out of here yeah
[3491.74 --> 3498.06]  pixel fold pixel fold pixel fold announced officially after you know it was leaked by
[3498.06 --> 3503.70]  absolutely everyone including video hands-on yeah awesome yeah why is it that google can't keep these
[3503.70 --> 3507.96]  things under control i don't get it i feel like it's intentional at this point it's literally been
[3507.96 --> 3514.78]  every pixel launch since like pixel became a thing you think so i think so well i don't know about the uh
[3514.78 --> 3522.24]  intentional thing but there's no way they care that much or else they'd be able to get some amount of
[3522.24 --> 3529.70]  wraps on you know what i accidentally pulled mine out on wanshow like pixel two pixel something well
[3529.70 --> 3534.48]  and remember like somebody just left some early pixel device at a bar well no they were mad and i think
[3534.48 --> 3538.52]  you're thinking of an iphone actually for that was it okay yeah that was that was pretty that was pretty
[3538.52 --> 3543.50]  early on and apple was mad and i think eventually did recover it and that's all that like was a whole
[3543.50 --> 3548.74]  thing but for the pixel i i did pull one out on wanshow once by accident and they were definitely
[3548.74 --> 3559.10]  mad so maybe it's shifted since then maybe i don't know they just suck at this it's hard for me to say
[3559.10 --> 3568.40]  but somehow apple manages to do a much much better job of it yeah like i mean samsung does a better
[3568.40 --> 3574.48]  job of it like usually they're basically every other phone maker well i mean it feels like pixel
[3574.48 --> 3578.32]  has the most like you were just talking about there's video hands-on yeah pixel has the most
[3578.32 --> 3584.26]  like brutal leaks and that happens with samsung devices as well but i also don't think it's fair
[3584.26 --> 3589.64]  to compare against other mobile device makers either because the reality of it is for the vast majority
[3589.64 --> 3595.62]  of the rest of them no one cares and that's why nobody puts the kind of effort like sticks their neck
[3595.62 --> 3604.06]  out to leak this thing because why um and it's not like you can't find leaks it's just the the degree
[3604.06 --> 3609.82]  to which pixel devices get leaked i'm sure as a xiaomi me something it's probably leaked at some point
[3609.82 --> 3614.36]  uh but it doesn't gain the same kind of momentum so maybe that's part of it too is that there's no
[3614.36 --> 3624.02]  there's no news cycle around some you know red magic gaming phone yeah no one cares that's fair enough
[3624.02 --> 3630.10]  well google has announced the upcoming pixel folds nearly all the details of the phone had already
[3630.10 --> 3636.46]  leaked weeks ago so very little of the announcement was a surprise according to leaked internal documents
[3636.46 --> 3643.42]  the fold is expected to have a 5.8 inch outer display that folds out into a 7.6 inch tablet display
[3643.42 --> 3650.12]  and the most durable hinge on a foldable there were no particulars attached to this claim of durability
[3650.12 --> 3655.90]  such as how many thousands of times the phone can be folded before becoming damaged google has not
[3655.90 --> 3662.12]  mentioned an exact price or release date but the fold is expected to cost over 1700 dollars according
[3662.12 --> 3669.22]  to the same leaked documents oh discussion question how durable does a foldable phone need to be to make
[3669.22 --> 3675.92]  it worth it uh it it can't will the pixel fold be significantly better than the samsung foldable
[3675.92 --> 3687.00]  so i would like to talk about that yeah i'm hopeful if only because i like foldable phones i well i
[3687.00 --> 3692.30]  don't i shouldn't say i like foldable phones would you buy one i like okay let's get to that later okay
[3692.30 --> 3703.44]  i like being able to have a big big spreadsheet in my pocket i like this this helps my life hopefully
[3703.44 --> 3708.44]  that's not important uh no it's not it's uh it's the data from how much cooling do you need okay uh so
[3708.44 --> 3714.16]  that video went up uh yesterday this is a lot of data points hey you guys like that are you are you a data
[3714.16 --> 3721.88]  nerd so let's go yeah um it makes it just makes a really big difference for me i want to see the
[3721.88 --> 3727.18]  screen tech continue to evolve because right now it seems like you get a year of trouble-free operation
[3727.18 --> 3733.36]  out of it and after that it develops micro cracks at least mine has um but for me the bigger issue
[3733.36 --> 3737.66]  isn't even that because i'll keep using this with micro cracks down this down the middle like
[3737.66 --> 3746.80]  whatever for me the bigger issue is software and the one most annoying software vendor
[3746.80 --> 3754.80]  that has made this experience noticeably worse for me over the almost three years now i think i've been
[3754.80 --> 3766.56]  daily driving a foldable phone is google i still still don't have support for stories and in fact
[3766.56 --> 3772.88]  this is wild right it's inconsistent so right now i have only three options which ones are missing i
[3772.88 --> 3778.32]  have upload a video i have go live and i've created a post i can't even upload a short right now i don't
[3778.32 --> 3784.48]  think hold on do i have another i don't have another phone on me right now uh oh oh hold on hold on
[3784.48 --> 3787.50]  that might be in the wrong profile might be in the wrong profile for that so let's do
[3787.50 --> 3798.68]  okay yeah no no i have no shorts um that sucks i'm wearing shorts i can create a post but hold on a
[3798.68 --> 3805.94]  second get wrecked or wait how do i just go to the channel oh for crying out loud just go to the
[3805.94 --> 3810.36]  chat stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop okay community okay the community
[3810.36 --> 3817.80]  posts at least work now so that's good that was broken for a very long time but i still can't
[3817.80 --> 3825.14]  upload stories can't upload shorts i have escalated this and i know they got it because i've escalated
[3825.14 --> 3832.10]  it through their uh their creator liaison i've escalated it through the top creator manager that i
[3832.10 --> 3840.00]  have i've escalated it in person at like the vp level okay to youtube
[3840.00 --> 3851.28]  i have made videos about it um i have complained about it on wanshow they know they know you know
[3851.28 --> 3858.04]  what the problem is that this version of the youtube app is the tablet or is is derived from the tablet
[3858.04 --> 3864.62]  version of the youtube app which was behind on android not on ios where the ipad could do
[3864.62 --> 3871.48]  everything just fine um and it was behind the development of all the other apps and we're not
[3871.48 --> 3879.08]  talking days behind or weeks behind we are talking years behind at this point
[3879.08 --> 3890.20]  so i don't know google should i trust this device should i trust you to give two flying craps
[3890.20 --> 3896.94]  about supporting your hardware properly when you're not supporting your ecosystem partners properly
[3896.94 --> 3902.48]  and you're just putting the tablet version on and then not bothering to update the tablet version of
[3902.48 --> 3908.16]  youtube see this this upcoming generation of phones is probably going to mark an upgrade for me
[3908.16 --> 3910.20]  considering all the problems i've been having with my phone
[3910.20 --> 3919.90]  i can't the extra street screen space like the the app problems what i do on my phone i would
[3919.90 --> 3925.86]  probably run into less of the app problems that you run into and i would probably run into more
[3925.86 --> 3930.48]  beneficial things being able to open that spreadsheet would be great that type of stuff is going to be
[3930.48 --> 3938.02]  more in line with what i'm doing um but it's a 1700 phone that is going to show
[3938.02 --> 3943.74]  extreme wear after a year and chat chat you're not wrong a lot of them are saying look they don't
[3943.74 --> 3949.74]  care because there's so few of these things out there i know that's why you should almost never buy
[3949.74 --> 3955.70]  the top end crazy motherboard yeah you should always buy whatever the most popular one is because that's
[3955.70 --> 3959.18]  the one that's going to get bios development that's the one where they're going to prioritize
[3959.18 --> 3964.76]  fixing issues because if they don't fix issues they're going to get 10 000 customer support tickets
[3964.76 --> 3971.76]  and it's going to bury their support department right if you know a hundred enthusiasts have a
[3971.76 --> 3978.92]  problem you know yeah those are your theoretically your your best customers who spend the most money
[3978.92 --> 3986.22]  with you and you'd think you would treat them well but in practice it's it's not it's not pragmatic
[3986.22 --> 3990.72]  right to deal with them first you deal with the big problem first so they're much more likely
[3990.72 --> 3997.84]  not over the short term over the long term i'm talking five years later when resizable bar shows
[3997.84 --> 4004.00]  up as a feature the most mainstream board is the one that's most likely to a get a first party update
[4004.00 --> 4009.88]  and b potentially get a community update that hacks support in because so many people have them
[4009.88 --> 4019.40]  but that's not an excuse if your concern is that so few people need this this device and need it to
[4019.40 --> 4025.00]  work properly then why the are you making one yeah that's the counter argument
[4026.52 --> 4031.72]  so fine you don't care okay then don't make it this feels like we're going to run into the same
[4031.72 --> 4036.52]  problem a really long time ago you and i still like echoing this whole i don't remember what brand
[4036.52 --> 4041.88]  it was i'm sure you do uh but there was a case and power supply brand that made a case that didn't
[4041.88 --> 4047.56]  really fit its own power supply oh it was probably antech i think so yeah i just don't 100 remember yeah
[4047.56 --> 4052.04]  but we used to meme on them all the time because it's like how do you not try your own power supply
[4052.04 --> 4056.28]  in your own case and this feels like the same kind of thing like i suspect they're going to launch and
[4056.28 --> 4061.16]  they're still going to have these problems and that's a different level of unacceptable yeah how did
[4061.16 --> 4066.04]  you not run your own software yeah on your own product like if you're going to release a folding
[4066.04 --> 4069.72]  phone your stuff should probably freaking work for it that's crazy
[4069.72 --> 4079.48]  i'm still hopeful i would like for it to be good and there's definitely some things that you know
[4079.48 --> 4086.12]  i wouldn't mind upgrade because this is uh this is a fold threes this is this is last gen um there's
[4086.12 --> 4090.20]  definitely some things that i wouldn't mind seeing improved i wouldn't mind a better camera
[4091.80 --> 4098.12]  so i'm definitely going to try and daily drive it but i want to see a really good software experience
[4098.12 --> 4104.28]  and if my problem was with i mean oh yeah here's another funny one if my problem was with third
[4104.28 --> 4112.20]  party apps right obviously i i get it you know how do you incentivize a small app developer like
[4112.20 --> 4121.08]  floatplane inc to to you know make it so that the app works properly within you know with my folding
[4121.08 --> 4127.56]  phone or whatever right um how would they be able to do that if google themselves can't do it
[4127.56 --> 4133.08]  so i i get that right but here here's two google apps that don't work properly i already showed you
[4133.08 --> 4138.68]  youtube okay here's the studio oh wait no hold on i gotta show you no no this is this is better oh by
[4138.68 --> 4144.60]  the way for for people interested uh the flow plane beta site's fixed already okay always be fast youtube
[4144.60 --> 4149.40]  studio this is the creator app for monitoring your channel and everything so i'm just going to cut
[4149.40 --> 4154.12]  casually open oh wait what what what what is that what are these what are these pillar boxes
[4155.00 --> 4160.52]  are you kidding me right now okay so then i try and do the same thing so this comes down to this
[4160.52 --> 4165.32]  comes down to app support so i do the same thing on floatplane and i open it up and it just works
[4165.32 --> 4171.40]  properly it fills the whole screen like come on google this is your own software running on your own
[4171.40 --> 4178.36]  operating system okay technically it's samsung touch whatever they call it now touch was new touch was
[4178.36 --> 4187.48]  but i'm pretty sure that you could make this work you've had three and a half years of retail
[4187.48 --> 4193.08]  availability which means you've had more like four plus years of this product being in development
[4193.08 --> 4197.72]  knowing this is happening and apparently you care about folding devices because you're building your
[4197.72 --> 4200.68]  own one so you would think you would be trying to figure this out
[4200.68 --> 4212.84]  that's it that's all my rage for this but i'm still oh right i dodged your question yeah
[4212.84 --> 4219.32]  seventeen hundred dollars because because it is very expensive but you have been in the folding ecosystem
[4219.32 --> 4227.32]  for a long time now so exiting would probably be a pretty significant pain point it's easier for me
[4227.32 --> 4229.48]  because i have not been using a folder
[4229.48 --> 4241.48]  pretty tough yeah not because i can't afford it not because i don't see the value
[4243.32 --> 4251.32]  but i am very cheap yeah and it's not a question of yeah it's not a question of does it have a value
[4251.32 --> 4258.92]  to me it really does but does it have because like honestly these days right i don't game on my phone
[4258.92 --> 4264.28]  no i could get by with like a phone for a few hundred bucks realistically yeah it just needs a
[4264.28 --> 4271.32]  good battery life screen brightness so does it and you can get that for like 3.99 no problem but usually
[4271.32 --> 4277.16]  like something really nice for 4.99 5.99 usually has other drawbacks though i find yeah
[4277.16 --> 4284.76]  yeah so is it worth another thousand dollars i feel like the way that some people spend money is
[4284.76 --> 4292.52]  really different from me though like i will i will drop okay here's something um i was asked for
[4292.52 --> 4299.00]  approval for three thousand dollars for uh for like i don't know three eighths of an inch thick
[4299.00 --> 4305.64]  concrete pad in the middle of the lab warehouse because they were concerned that if it wasn't level enough
[4305.64 --> 4312.60]  the spot where they put our rf isolation chamber that it could potentially like cause problems i was
[4312.60 --> 4319.48]  like okay because that's that's business right theoretically we're gonna create content we're
[4319.48 --> 4324.28]  gonna generate revenue but then if you ask me but there could that's the other thing with the fold
[4325.08 --> 4329.72]  is if you you said you don't play games on it but if you work on it and if you're able to extract a
[4329.72 --> 4335.40]  thousand dollars worth of value due to work i do but my eyes are still okay i can i could use a candy bar if
[4335.40 --> 4342.20]  i really needed to yeah right like so so if you so if you tell me okay now it's now it's for something
[4342.20 --> 4352.36]  personally um it's gonna cost you 50 bucks and it's a it's a bracket that holds up this thing um
[4352.36 --> 4357.64]  you're making myself like yeah i don't know i could probably just i could probably just get like a
[4357.64 --> 4361.48]  like a drywall anchor and a little l bracket and put a piece of two by four on it it's fine
[4361.48 --> 4369.16]  yeah right like i i just have a completely different way of thinking about stuff that i use
[4369.16 --> 4375.56]  personally yeah like i didn't upgrade uh until we started doing videos about it because i was locked
[4375.56 --> 4382.52]  in my house uh for the for the covid shutdown or whatever i hadn't touched my computer for like
[4382.52 --> 4387.32]  several years and you would think i would just upgrade my computer all the time because i just
[4387.32 --> 4392.20]  you know want a fast computer and obviously there's fast computer hardware like falling out
[4392.20 --> 4398.44]  of the sky around here you do like working on your house but that's not necessarily fair because i feel
[4398.44 --> 4403.40]  like the example you were giving earlier was for something for yourself that was in your house not
[4403.40 --> 4409.80]  content a lot of the also that but i feel like working on your house in general benefits like your
[4409.80 --> 4419.32]  family yes and content and content and content uh i like yes sometimes i do it the hard way just
[4419.32 --> 4423.72]  because i'm like this will be kind of fun yeah and that's the thing is i think some people will
[4423.72 --> 4429.96]  cynically go well he's doing it just for content and i'm like no no i'm doing it because it's fun and
[4429.96 --> 4436.84]  fun makes good content so you missed a step i could do it that is actually an important step i could just hire
[4436.84 --> 4444.20]  someone to put a control for a system in my house absolutely it's not a question of of of cost it's
[4444.20 --> 4450.76]  a question of well what fun is that let's make a video about it yeah i can't make a video about some
[4450.76 --> 4455.72]  professional contractor coming in and you can't it's going to be very interesting well i mean we've done
[4455.72 --> 4461.00]  it we've done it i mean brian the electrician we brought him in to just he wired up a stupid ups
[4461.00 --> 4468.20]  stupid what no no it adds to it when it's like ridiculous i don't i'm not wasn't saying it's no
[4468.20 --> 4473.32]  it was just no it was just a professional choice it was just a good ups yeah but like and it's like
[4473.32 --> 4478.04]  a really sick ups okay and then we did this okay okay but then we did the same thing i brought in brian
[4478.04 --> 4485.80]  the electrician to put a car charger in my garage and that was really the boringest siemens car charger
[4485.80 --> 4490.60]  that ever existed at that point in time i feel like he's a character on the channel though uh okay
[4490.60 --> 4496.52]  okay that's kind of fair that's kind of fair i'm just saying brian the electric i'm just saying we can
[4496.52 --> 4501.24]  bring in a contractor to basically do the work and i can make a video about it i can make that work look
[4502.44 --> 4508.36]  if i had a superpower i think it's that i can get a million views on a hard drive
[4508.36 --> 4519.00]  and i i've i've i it's not just that specifically but it's it's like i don't have you know mr beast's
[4519.00 --> 4526.44]  just intuitive sense of how to make the most captivating crack cocaine in video form like
[4526.44 --> 4535.64]  addictive content imaginable i can't do it i don't have that kind of imagination and i don't have the kind of
[4535.64 --> 4543.96]  um you know slick approach that like an mkbhd or mr who's the boss might take to covering the latest
[4543.96 --> 4549.88]  smartphone in a way that is super digestible to a mainstream audience but if there's anything that
[4549.88 --> 4556.28]  i can do better than any of them it's i can get a million views on a hard drive or some enterprise
[4556.28 --> 4564.04]  piece of software like something that the makers of it couldn't possibly imagine getting
[4565.80 --> 4572.04]  a hundred views on youtube let alone let alone a million and it was something that i uh i remember
[4572.04 --> 4575.88]  it just kind of slipped out of my mouth when i was having a meeting with some hard drive manufacturer
[4575.88 --> 4581.16]  at like ces or something like that uh and they were just like yeah i mean i don't know that they
[4581.16 --> 4584.04]  basically were not too worried about the video because they were like i don't know they didn't
[4584.04 --> 4588.44]  really know who we were i don't know it doesn't really matter is anyone going to watch this i'm like
[4588.44 --> 4595.08]  oh yeah like we are probably the only channel on earth that can get a million views on a hard drive
[4595.08 --> 4601.80]  and then i was like yeah yeah we probably are that's pretty cool and so that dang it
[4602.84 --> 4606.60]  that's what we can do that's what i do that's that's what we do
[4608.92 --> 4613.80]  heck yeah uh all right what are we talking about i think we just finished our second of two topics and
[4613.80 --> 4617.08]  we're moving on to the next thing dan's paying very close attention to the show you can tell
[4617.08 --> 4625.40]  sponsors and we have a fun one today oh hit me oh oh oh we have a really good one today you guys

[4657.96 --> 4667.16]  man this kind of fpv technology is sick very cool i think the first time i ever experienced it was when we
[4667.16 --> 4676.52]  were creating those uh diy ones for ltx oh yeah they were a complete disaster because there were a
[4676.52 --> 4684.04]  lot of finicky technical details that we mostly kind of sort of got right yeah um but the first time
[4684.68 --> 4692.92]  i i i put the goggles on and experienced it i was like holy crap it's very this is like driving around
[4692.92 --> 4698.44]  in a giant video game world it's it's so cool um and they've got a ton of cool gameplay features so

[4735.48 --> 4740.28]  fun racing strategy some of them are great on straightaways but terrible in turns while others
[4740.28 --> 4744.36]  excel in tight corners um and maybe i guess are not as great on the straightaways otherwise you should

[5020.52 --> 5026.76]  somewhat recent i think uh little expansion to force of five which is a hot wheels expansion
[5026.76 --> 5032.76]  and it is super fun because they just stop caring about it being like a realistic racing game and you're
[5032.76 --> 5037.88]  just going around like hot wheels loops and there's boost packs on the ground and like magnetic floor and all
[5037.88 --> 5044.12]  this crazy stuff it's very fun it's like actually very fun sorry i i i was like i was stressed out and tuned out for a second
[5044.60 --> 5053.72]  um sorry what uh what game how do we how do we know that we have official news by the way i don't know i'm sure i'm sure that dan i will be informed

[5067.00 --> 5071.72]  it's very fun um i enjoy it no offense to the forza people but i enjoy it more than the main game
[5071.72 --> 5076.28]  uh flip plane chat i can't read your username but did nerdforge decline going to ltx they couldn't
[5076.28 --> 5081.00]  make it they wanted to it don't worry we haven't had a falling out or anything we're chill love those
[5081.00 --> 5089.24]  guys pretty busy but yeah life's busy yes we are still going to auction the uh amazing pc that uh
[5089.24 --> 5094.44]  uh i was going to say we co-built but they did most of the really cool work uh that that they
[5094.44 --> 5098.68]  made for us um that's going to happen at ltx and it's going to be for charity it's going to be awesome
[5101.00 --> 5105.64]  apparently someone watching the show is literally playing the forza hot wheels expansion right now
[5105.64 --> 5114.60]  nice nice it's good okay it's time for a few merch messages dan hit me okay i went to a christmas
[5114.60 --> 5120.68]  soccer match where santa parachuted from the halftime show but clipped the roof and plummeted shocking the
[5120.68 --> 5129.96]  children uh what's the biggest mishap in front of a crowd you've witnessed wow witnessed no part of that
[5129.96 --> 5144.20]  that sounded real um um wow i mean yeah i'm never gonna beat that story yeah like what so i don't know
[5144.20 --> 5154.60]  i don't feel like i've with oh i know mine i don't mind a hundred percent no question okay go jensen just
[5154.60 --> 5166.68]  going off on stage at um tom peterson yeah that was incredibly awkward and and like the videos are
[5166.68 --> 5174.36]  bad i wasn't there i was there but i've heard that in person it was it was rough because like the camera
[5174.36 --> 5181.16]  didn't show the whole thing but you could see tap like when he went off stage and stuff and like he
[5181.16 --> 5187.64]  handled it very professionally in my opinion jensen super did not but tap did but like
[5189.24 --> 5194.52]  it was just it was actually more awkward because their response to it was not matched
[5195.24 --> 5200.36]  right like if they both handled it super poorly it would probably have been less awkward a fight yeah
[5201.16 --> 5209.40]  but instead it was just someone in a position of very uneven power just like clapping on someone on stage
[5209.40 --> 5213.08]  and it's just like man i that was that was rough that was very rough
[5215.88 --> 5221.72]  biggest mishap in front of a crowd i'm just trying to think like honestly the ones that the ones that i
[5221.72 --> 5228.20]  do definitely hit me the hardest but i haven't spent that much time in front of a crowd like i've
[5228.20 --> 5233.16]  definitely made some mistakes i dropped that razor blade laptop when i was supposed to be unveiling it
[5233.16 --> 5239.32]  at the first ltx that was not the best kind of sick um very on brand i but yeah at least yeah it wasn't
[5239.32 --> 5245.80]  it wasn't that bad like i've never accidentally you know i'm just trying to think of anything that would be
[5245.80 --> 5251.16]  really really bad i mean i've done lots of dumb stuff on street does that count
[5253.64 --> 5257.72]  i don't know i mean like okay like i've thrown stuff into a crowd and like
[5258.84 --> 5262.92]  accidentally nailed people with stuff and it's been pretty bad like that's bad i guess
[5263.64 --> 5268.76]  that's a mishap um i'm not gonna stop doing it pax used to be a lot more fun when they allowed that
[5268.76 --> 5272.52]  they have hard band it now you're not allowed throwing anything not even t-shirts really yeah
[5272.52 --> 5276.36]  it's not stupid no i'm gonna throw stuff at ltx yeah heck yeah yeah let's go yeah let's go
[5278.52 --> 5284.84]  next linus liability tips mr linus i occasionally hear south park references do you have a favorite
[5284.84 --> 5290.84]  character or episode how would you feel about your likeness being portrayed on the show oh favorite
[5290.84 --> 5296.68]  favorite favorite episodes got tenderman must die 100 that's when that's when cartman went from
[5296.68 --> 5303.48]  just kind of like an awful little child to the complete sociopath that we know and love now um
[5303.48 --> 5307.48]  you know if i had to pick a few handfuls i mean for me really the golden age is from about
[5308.36 --> 5315.64]  late season two slash season three to maybe i guess as soon as we start making it into anything with the
[5315.64 --> 5320.60]  coon anything with the kind of continuity from episode to episode with stupid integrity farms and all that
[5320.60 --> 5327.08]  kind of garbage um pretty much that so kind of like season three season eight season nine maybe ten
[5327.96 --> 5333.00]  kind of kind of in there um so you know cartman land is amazing anything anything where cartman is
[5333.00 --> 5337.24]  particularly evil and then gets particularly on is pretty much my favorite
[5340.28 --> 5347.96]  all right let's see next one here love the show boys linus as a fellow late 80s child and currently in
[5347.96 --> 5355.00]  it tech how do you adjust seeing younger and younger people join your team uh tech especially seems like
[5355.00 --> 5365.40]  a young person's game yeah i mean for me it's um what choice do i have right like if we if we want to
[5365.40 --> 5375.88]  if we want to stay hip and with it you know and uh and uh i don't think either of those are currently
[5375.88 --> 5383.48]  trendy names and down you know we want to stay bussin yeah i don't know if that's good or no cap for real
[5383.48 --> 5391.40]  for real yeah exactly yeah uh you know we i i can't i can't expect myself to be cool i never was so the best
[5391.40 --> 5396.92]  that we can do is we can keep trying to attract talent keep trying to evolve keep bringing in fresh
[5396.92 --> 5402.36]  ideas and that's where fresh ideas come from fresh ideas don't come from people who have been doing
[5402.36 --> 5412.92]  this for 30 years right so yeah i i i guess i i don't know it's a funny thing because at work i don't
[5412.92 --> 5418.04]  really think about that i'm like you know twice jake's age or whatever it doesn't really matter what
[5418.04 --> 5424.68]  no it's not twice but but i'm a lot older than him um and i and it's it's the same like it's it's
[5424.68 --> 5430.28]  not until the slang comes out that i notice someone's actually part of a completely different
[5430.28 --> 5436.68]  generation from me because tech is our common language right so when you've got that in common
[5436.68 --> 5443.00]  it's easy but if i was to go to a completely different environment if i was to go to a club
[5443.00 --> 5450.04]  or something yeah i'd i'd feel far more out of place because of because of the the differences
[5450.04 --> 5458.52]  in my maybe music preferences or um yeah sure my my my way my manner of speaking you know does anyone
[5458.52 --> 5464.44]  still speak valley girl like is this this is still acceptable you know like like like like like like
[5464.44 --> 5474.68]  like like i i don't know um it's fine yeah that's right it's good it's it's just part of the process
[5474.68 --> 5479.16]  and in response to that second part of the south park question if that's a real you know offer if
[5479.16 --> 5485.00]  you actually work on the show i i can't you know i can't believe that's even a question of course next
[5487.08 --> 5490.84]  well i think that was three yeah why don't we slide another one in here how about that
[5491.56 --> 5498.84]  slide into my dms yeah do people still say that i don't know probably i mean it's all it's all it
[5498.84 --> 5508.92]  isn't anymore someone does no cat for real she that was bad do a merch message hello dan and the support
[5508.92 --> 5515.64]  staff linus a game of would you rather would you rather allow dan to remaster the christmas album
[5515.64 --> 5520.68]  or allow luke another shot at pizza warmer pc thanks for all you do
[5524.04 --> 5529.88]  dan you gotta stop sending your own merch messages that's not how this works i archive most of them
[5531.48 --> 5537.48]  stop talking about the christmas album the christmas album is not happening luke gets another shot at
[5537.48 --> 5542.92]  pizza warmer pc before you remaster the christmas album there's no question in my mind especially
[5542.92 --> 5548.28]  because luke never had a first shot at the piece that the pizza warming pc because it wasn't supposed to
[5548.28 --> 5556.92]  be a pizza warming pc it was supposed to be a pizza heat retention pc he just completely misunderstood the
[5556.92 --> 5557.40]  concept
[5561.72 --> 5563.56]  thank you for the excellent merch message
[5564.84 --> 5565.64]  oh i'm crying
[5565.64 --> 5574.36]  okay okay what do we do next i don't know give us the card oh we can't do anything if you don't
[5574.36 --> 5581.16]  give us a good okay do some more topics please all right oh geez uh oh i don't want to hate you
[5581.16 --> 5586.76]  all why do you all troll me like this you try to upset me make me do something or say something i'm not
[5586.76 --> 5593.32]  supposed to say on stream google engineer warns public researchers are winning the ai race a leaked document
[5593.32 --> 5598.36]  from from a senior google engineer luke samau hopefully i said that right warns that now i think
[5598.36 --> 5605.56]  quite close sir s-e-r-n-a-u yes that's an annoying typeface uh warns that both google and open ai may
[5605.56 --> 5612.44]  soon lose the ai race to open source development grassroots engineers have been making huge strides
[5612.44 --> 5621.96]  in part due to the leak of meta's llama llm in part in massive section uh just saying probably a factor
[5621.96 --> 5627.96]  yeah according to the document neither company has had the kind of secret sauce that will be
[5627.96 --> 5633.56]  enough to keep them ahead i believe they described it as a moat neither company has a moat uh worse
[5633.56 --> 5639.00]  while they've been focused on each other open source development has been quietly lapping them both
[5639.00 --> 5645.08]  with many public researchers achieving more with a few hundred dollars and a few weeks than what large
[5645.08 --> 5647.64]  companies are struggling to do with millions over the course of months
[5647.64 --> 5658.20]  the open groups are playing catch-up to be clear they're not lapping them is not a really fair way
[5658.20 --> 5663.80]  of saying it because they're they're still catching up but it's fine it sounds cool we're gonna stick
[5663.80 --> 5670.04]  with it specifically cited was the issue with running ai models on phones open source models are faster
[5670.04 --> 5677.48]  more customizable more private and pound for pound more capable luke the previously quoted person therefore
[5677.64 --> 5683.40]  urged that google should work with and learn from developers outside the company meanwhile an open
[5683.40 --> 5691.40]  letter to the european parliament authored primarily by german research group lion has advocated against
[5691.40 --> 5696.92]  regulation of grassroots development and smaller ai research firms in part to keep the eu competitive
[5696.92 --> 5702.36]  with the united states quoted rules that require a researcher or developer to monitor or control
[5702.36 --> 5708.04]  downstream downstream downstream use could make it impossible to release open source ai in europe
[5708.04 --> 5714.92]  which would entrench large firms and hamper efforts to improve transparency reduce competition
[5714.92 --> 5722.12]  limit academic freedom and drive investment in ai overseas like many ai forms lion has been criticized
[5722.12 --> 5727.16]  for not respecting the rights of artists whose work is included in their open source database
[5727.16 --> 5733.00]  including threatening counter suits against artists who have requested their work be removed
[5737.96 --> 5742.92]  um yeah we've been talking about this on wancho for a while but it's interesting seeing someone in
[5742.92 --> 5744.52]  within google talk about the same thing
[5748.12 --> 5753.40]  well you got to make a bold prediction now you got to keep the streak alive you don't get to just be
[5753.40 --> 5759.16]  no nostradamus didn't get to just make you know three predictions absolutely nail them and then go
[5760.12 --> 5764.60]  well i'm retiring with the perfect record you have to keep making predictions you want to know something
[5764.60 --> 5768.68]  funny you know how you've talked about this a bunch and i think this is genuinely very true one of the
[5768.68 --> 5772.76]  reasons why linus tech tips has been punchy for so long is because you get bored very quickly yeah
[5773.32 --> 5781.08]  i'm bored you're bored already i'm bored but but new stuff is happening the problem yeah is a lot of this
[5781.08 --> 5787.80]  stuff isn't actually really releasing especially not really in the way that people talk about its
[5787.80 --> 5794.68]  capabilities like a lot of the stuff that open ai is doing uh it's alphas and they're only giving it to
[5794.68 --> 5802.52]  some people so like the plugins thing we talked about this weeks ago do you have it no i don't have it
[5802.52 --> 5806.28]  right so if i don't get to play with it why do i care
[5808.52 --> 5816.20]  that's the uh co-pilot for office yeah looks like an insane disruptor yeah where is that where is it
[5818.60 --> 5825.00]  so i'm kind of gmail i'm kind of in a gmail where's google's well hold on here's what i really want to know
[5825.00 --> 5829.80]  call ivan ho
[5835.72 --> 5842.60]  oh wow it managed to do it i'm impressed but yeah like i i'm not i don't know if i should necessarily
[5842.60 --> 5851.00]  say bored i'm feeling like it's unnecessary to keep up with the news right now because we're i i feel like
[5851.56 --> 5856.76]  just like open ai had like the fastest adoption of a million users of anything like ever right i feel
[5856.76 --> 5860.52]  like there's you know that curve i don't remember the exact name of all the stages but you have
[5861.08 --> 5866.12]  the massive hype at the beginning of a new technology and then you have the massive drop of people
[5866.12 --> 5871.40]  realizing that it's like kind of junk right now because it's so new and then it jumps back up when
[5871.40 --> 5875.64]  you get to very productive stages and people actually start releasing things and it becomes very usable
[5875.64 --> 5882.28]  and then it trend lines forever basically and i don't feel like we're actually at the bottom of
[5882.28 --> 5889.40]  that first drop yet but i feel like we're over the hump because we're at the point where everybody's
[5889.40 --> 5896.44]  heard about it everybody has seen at least one really really cool demo of it like actually looking
[5896.44 --> 5905.00]  for is it i don't know it might be okay um but yeah everybody's heard of it like my even people
[5905.00 --> 5909.72]  that like are not into tech stuff has heard of it because it's been in mainstream news all that type of
[5909.72 --> 5914.52]  stuff you've given everybody the fear you've given everybody the hype you've given everybody all that
[5914.52 --> 5923.40]  kind of stuff now it's time to uh this is not exactly what i was describing it's the shape of the
[5923.40 --> 5931.32]  curve though very much excite very thing happen then less thing happen then as it gets better
[5931.32 --> 5935.88]  thing happened yeah that's pretty close yeah i think it's i think it's explaining the same concept it's
[5935.88 --> 5943.96]  just not the exact curve that i was talking about um but yeah it's time to deliver it's time to ship
[5943.96 --> 5952.76]  we need stuff apparently q3 for uh for co-pilot cool so i'm excited for q3 right that's where i'm
[5952.76 --> 5958.44]  currently looking yeah i guess that kind of is similar to how we really stopped talking about
[5958.44 --> 5963.96]  rumors so much on land show way back in the day like we used to talk a lot about oh here's the
[5963.96 --> 5970.28]  rumored spec of the upcoming g-force whatever and then it's got annoying what we'd realize is that
[5970.84 --> 5976.60]  the following week there'd be a new rumored spec ever so slightly different or sometimes the same
[5976.60 --> 5981.96]  but more sure this time and then the following week it'd be and then we just kind of felt like
[5981.96 --> 5988.12]  broken records we're just talking about this over and over and over and over again and making noise
[5988.12 --> 5993.48]  that has absolutely no value outside of the very moment that we first talked about it
[5994.92 --> 5999.08]  why don't we just wait and then it's out and then we can create an evergreen piece of content that will
[5999.08 --> 6003.96]  always inform you about that product i think that's some that's a mistake that i see a lot of
[6003.96 --> 6011.80]  starting out and even fairly experienced content creators making where they they make a video or
[6011.80 --> 6018.28]  write an article or whatever else it is whatever their medium is and they they make something that
[6018.84 --> 6026.76]  is relevant today and i think what they're missing is the algorithmic importance of someone watching
[6026.76 --> 6034.60]  your video or listening to your song or uh reading your article from a year ago or two years ago
[6034.60 --> 6041.64]  and still getting a value out of it ah okay okay what's this called it says this is the gartner hype
[6041.64 --> 6047.96]  cycle the hype cycle so the bottom left hand corner thing is technology trigger so the thing kind of
[6047.96 --> 6052.84]  shows up peak of inflated expectations trough of disillusionment all this type of stuff so i feel like
[6052.84 --> 6060.76]  we're we're kind of just over the the hump right now and if you're saying um if you're saying that
[6060.76 --> 6068.28]  it's going to be q3 we'll see we'll see yeah and hopefully we can avoid it too big of a time but yeah
[6068.28 --> 6071.96]  exactly what you're just describing i'm feeling that way about it i don't think there's actually a lot to
[6071.96 --> 6081.80]  talk about even this literal topic we have literally already talked about it right so yeah content back to
[6081.80 --> 6087.16]  what i was saying make content that is evergreen and you will be amazed what that will do for you
[6087.16 --> 6092.44]  you never know when like every once in a while uh one of the views that i like to look at in our
[6092.44 --> 6099.24]  analytics dashboard is what people have been watching most in the last 60 minutes and what's really
[6099.24 --> 6105.16]  interesting about that view that real-time view is that a lot of the time it's obviously going to have
[6105.16 --> 6110.92]  your last couple of videos you released but once in a while you'll have stuff show up okay so one of the
[6110.92 --> 6119.24]  things that's most watched in the last 60 minutes is adam's amd ultimate tech upgrade okay that really
[6119.24 --> 6125.96]  helps me keep an eye on what kinds of videos are gonna are gonna pop off in the longer term and get
[6125.96 --> 6132.20]  a get a second wind and a third wind and a fourth wind and really really take off uh and you will never
[6132.20 --> 6139.32]  put yourself in a position to do that if you create content that is just about the rumor mill just has
[6139.32 --> 6142.84]  absolutely no relevance and i'm not saying there's no place for that we created a whole channel for
[6142.84 --> 6149.00]  it it's called tech linked uh we created a second channel for it it's called game linked um which
[6149.00 --> 6154.44]  don't worry we will we will launch we will launch eventually uh there's been some challenges internally
[6154.44 --> 6159.72]  getting it a getting it across the finish line but we're we're gonna get it there it's gonna be awesome
[6159.72 --> 6163.48]  it's gonna be great riley and his team are doing an amazing job getting everything set up for it
[6163.48 --> 6171.48]  but okay ai i guess we'll just kind of play the waiting game and yeah like maybe we talk about
[6171.48 --> 6176.52]  something here they're like someone in chat said look at the auto gpt repo graph it's literally the
[6176.52 --> 6184.04]  graph you just showed and it's like yeah like right yeah it's it's there there is cool stuff happening
[6184.04 --> 6189.96]  chat or the chat gpt code interpreter thing looks super sweet but like almost none of us can even try it
[6189.96 --> 6197.72]  so whatever i don't know i'm off the i'm i'm still paying attention but until we get more
[6198.68 --> 6203.80]  things shipped products shipped i i think i'm i think i'm kind of chilling for now all right
[6206.04 --> 6210.36]  why don't we talk about oh and and sorry one other thing because people keep spamming this
[6210.36 --> 6216.60]  i know a lot of the new ai stuff is open source stuff totally and that's fantastic i'm not saying it's
[6216.60 --> 6221.96]  bad i'm not saying they're moving slowly i think they are moving super super fast i am also thinking
[6221.96 --> 6227.88]  that they aren't quite 100 there and one of the reasons why they're moving really fast is is like
[6227.88 --> 6233.40]  the the leaks and whatnot that we've been seeing the the transparency on what data sets that these
[6233.40 --> 6239.64]  companies are using to feed their models um and a lot of other kind of stuff like that people breaking
[6239.64 --> 6244.44]  off from these big companies to start startups that are currently working in the open source space so they
[6244.44 --> 6250.04]  just sort of happen to know what's going on over there stuff like that is happening a lot right
[6250.04 --> 6259.00]  now which is fantastic it's very cool um but it's the same thing um so it's it's not like the most
[6259.00 --> 6264.36]  exciting talk about a wan you know what else is happening a lot right now what's up amd's new u class of
[6264.36 --> 6273.08]  chips oh okay i know that on wan show it's not necessarily the best place to get your news about an upcoming
[6273.64 --> 6279.72]  cpu or or gpu because we can't you know put up all the graphs and and all that kind of stuff that
[6279.72 --> 6285.80]  is that is really helpful for understanding just how good this product is but you don't need that
[6285.80 --> 6290.36]  what you need is hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype because these things
[6290.36 --> 6299.16]  are amazing amd has released specs and performance data for its new zen 4 ryzen 7040u phoenix series
[6299.16 --> 6305.56]  processors they're designed for thin and light laptops so these are like 15 to 30 watt cpus like
[6306.20 --> 6308.36]  the framework laptop 13
[6311.64 --> 6312.68]  i'm so excited
[6315.56 --> 6322.36]  not just as an investor i just want one in my laptop they're based on zen 4 okay so latest cpu
[6322.36 --> 6330.60]  architecture with rdna3 based radeon 700m gpus and team red says these chips should be able to go
[6330.60 --> 6338.44]  head to head with apple's m2 processors with the flagship 7840u supposedly performing 75 percent
[6338.44 --> 6344.84]  better than the m2 in past mark 10. you notice apple's whole apple silicon thing like started out like
[6344.84 --> 6350.92]  really strong and in typical apple mac fashion has kind of got
[6352.52 --> 6358.04]  good enough just deflated just leave it where it is like remember when they launched the mac pro and
[6358.04 --> 6362.20]  they were like yeah we're back with upgradability and it's going to be different this time and they
[6362.20 --> 6366.52]  launched the mac pro and then never updated it again
[6366.52 --> 6376.20]  why do they just why are they so apathetic toward their mac users i don't know it's kind of shocking
[6376.20 --> 6388.68]  yep uh anywho amd also claims victory over intel's competing 13th gen chip the core i7 1360p by 30 to 228
[6388.68 --> 6395.80]  percent on various tests if you look closely and this is really cool uh this chart is from
[6396.84 --> 6404.12]  uh a non-tech credit a non-tech for this chart this is amazing if you look closely uh hold on
[6405.16 --> 6415.24]  okay i can't uh dan can you move uh us please yeah thank you one sec the ryzen 7 7840u bears a lot of
[6415.24 --> 6423.40]  resemblance to the ryzen z1 extreme they both have eight core 16 threads uh really that's how you do
[6423.40 --> 6435.40]  you know it doesn't matter uh 12 cus in their igpu uh 16 megs of level 3 cache and a maximum 30 watt tdp
[6436.76 --> 6442.60]  how interesting oh i did that just in time yeah it's fine uh the ryzen z1 extreme is going to be
[6442.60 --> 6450.20]  powering the rog ally when it launches next week these chips are amd's first to launch with ryzen ai
[6450.20 --> 6455.16]  which is powered by its xdna ai architecture courtesy of the company's acquisition of xilinx
[6455.16 --> 6461.08]  last year ryzen ai will apparently power upcoming features in windows 11 like the studio effects pack
[6461.08 --> 6466.60]  that can be only used with dedicated ai hardware it's possible people will be able to hack around it
[6466.60 --> 6471.96]  but it will almost certainly uh result in additional power consumption which on a mobile device would not be
[6471.96 --> 6476.52]  desirable so just because you can work around it doesn't necessarily mean that you should
[6476.52 --> 6482.60]  speaking of windows being optimized for certain chips this is great windows 12 might end up optimized
[6482.60 --> 6491.08]  for custom microsoft silicon arm-based socs if multiple new job listings for chip designers are any
[6491.08 --> 6500.68]  indication would you buy microsoft silicon well don't look too enthusiastic
[6504.68 --> 6510.52]  i find with a lot of microsoft hardware products there's a bunch of really cool stuff
[6510.52 --> 6518.12]  and then there's some like glaring drawback problems yeah and then there's not necessarily like
[6522.04 --> 6527.08]  it's not like apple's perfect you know i think the fact that they rug pulled 3d touch which was the
[6527.08 --> 6536.92]  coolest feature ever um sucks you know yeah um but in general if you upgrade from an iphone to an iphone
[6536.92 --> 6542.60]  from a mac to a mac you can expect some degree of continuity and that was definitely intentional
[6543.96 --> 6551.32]  whereas on the windows side and even within microsoft's own surface products i don't feel like
[6551.32 --> 6556.52]  that same thing exists they don't have the same level of commit and whether that's an unwillingness to
[6556.52 --> 6563.16]  continue to invest in things that are not immediate w's or whether that's just maybe not
[6563.16 --> 6570.12]  thinking ahead enough as to like what about the viability of a product like microsoft has some
[6570.12 --> 6576.20]  like serious wins in the hardware space but you know soft's in the name they've always felt like a
[6576.20 --> 6582.84]  software company like uh do they do they still can can you still do they still have that ai o that you
[6582.84 --> 6587.32]  can like stick the surface dial to the screen or whatever oh yeah
[6587.32 --> 6595.56]  the surface dial is apparently still a thing with 363 reviews on the microsoft store
[6596.52 --> 6603.16]  on surface i can't even remember what some of their pcs were called surface surface surface
[6603.16 --> 6608.52]  studio or studio people are saying studio is that the one okay can you still buy a surface studio
[6608.52 --> 6613.80]  i remember even when it launched it had last gen hardware in it yeah have they updated this bloody
[6613.80 --> 6620.36]  thing okay here let's have a look at it am i am i just ignorant nope it's still like nine thousand
[6620.36 --> 6624.92]  dollars i want to wait this is a laptop this screen this is a laptop okay now hold on just a gosh darn
[6624.92 --> 6633.80]  minute computers uh surface studio two plus okay did i just miss something here is this is this current
[6633.80 --> 6642.60]  yep starting from six thousand canadian dollars where's my tech spec set uh okay that's still a 28 inch
[6642.60 --> 6650.12]  display which is like fine 11th gen processor no this has not been updated
[6652.36 --> 6659.40]  so this is just can i can i order this thing 11th gen processor 32 gigs of ram and a one terabyte ssd
[6659.40 --> 6665.64]  for six grand non-user serviceable i've repaired one they're brutal this is just languishing
[6665.64 --> 6672.84]  and it was you know some parts of it were were cutting edge so thunderbolt 4 is still it's got windows 11
[6675.00 --> 6678.84]  is this real i can actually order this outdated computer
[6681.24 --> 6687.32]  wow i'm sure glad i customized this i can choose english keyboard or terrible keyboard
[6687.32 --> 6695.24]  is that it select a configuration i mean well yeah what other one am i going to select microsoft
[6696.12 --> 6702.92]  my options are that and that and then i can decide if i want any microsoft 365 with that
[6704.04 --> 6711.80]  uh no i don't want additional protection this is it i can get a wireless headset
[6711.80 --> 6721.40]  um an ugly mouse or a different ugly mouse wow yeah so that's the thing like where's your where's
[6721.40 --> 6727.64]  your commit and it's not like okay i mean we just criticized apple for releasing a literal 40 000
[6727.64 --> 6735.32]  computer that they then pretend start immediately start pretending doesn't exist anymore yeah right but
[6735.32 --> 6740.84]  this is regular for microsoft it's like it's like it's like netflix right so you you kind of sit there
[6740.84 --> 6746.28]  and go oh yeah i love this paradigm where i have this like zero gravity hinge or whatever and i can put
[6746.28 --> 6751.72]  my dial on my thing and i can do all this stuff will this continue to get any development like what's
[6751.72 --> 6761.64]  going on with the surface duo aj's all i guess aj uses the french canadian keyboard layout i'm sorry to hear
[6761.64 --> 6773.48]  that you employ this man aj's great he can he can have an exception he can have his he can have his bad
[6773.48 --> 6781.16]  his bad layout okay what what's going on with this thing uh microsoft has just started casually low-key
[6781.80 --> 6787.72]  not providing regular updates for it um i saw an article that was and i don't know how true the
[6787.72 --> 6794.52]  the speculation about the reassignment of the team is but someone's saying it's updated each year
[6794.52 --> 6799.72]  apparently not the processor oh yeah no that it's not fair to just say like yeah we ship with a
[6799.72 --> 6805.72]  more up-to-date operating system yeah that's not enough else is updated yeah 11th gen 11th gen
[6807.32 --> 6815.96]  it at rtx 3060 like i don't know was it was it well hold on a second did the original one have a
[6815.96 --> 6822.60]  2060 i think it has been updated because i did the video on the first one okay so like it's been a
[6822.60 --> 6831.56]  minute dude it's been probably like seven years it must have received at least one update but it is
[6831.56 --> 6837.00]  not currently up to date i would say okay well maybe maybe i'm just being mean but yeah surface
[6837.00 --> 6844.04]  duo is another one that i'm just kind of looking at going yeah really i mean if you search for surface
[6844.04 --> 6852.12]  studio this is another thing too like i guess even if they are updating this thing does anyone care
[6852.68 --> 6859.40]  so we've got this one result and then it's just laptop oh wait no no no we've got an only one pc
[6859.40 --> 6866.52]  okay is anyone buying this thing again like i said oh wow no reviews yet be the first
[6866.52 --> 6878.12]  oh that's a yikes that's a big yikes um okay cool
[6880.60 --> 6887.24]  i think we have some news oh we do oh yeah oh yeah just give me a second here guys what no
[6887.24 --> 6895.88]  what what no time given jeez now everybody's expecting something breaking news i think we have
[6895.88 --> 6902.28]  breaking news okay oh oh oh it's all going wrong my phone's going off now oh geez
[6905.24 --> 6912.04]  we have news oh oh we have news oh oh it's good news oh yeah what did you think i was trying to
[6912.04 --> 6918.04]  leave some suspense what the heck you were talking about would you like to see the news okay yes hit
[6918.04 --> 6925.72]  it hit it hit it okay he said yes i believe he said yes um yeah it was it was our pleasure thank you
[6925.72 --> 6934.28]  very much um it's a lot of fun we've had kind of we've had some requests for from people to you know
[6934.28 --> 6942.04]  do stuff before like that i receive a shocking number of wedding invitations no really though
[6942.04 --> 6946.44]  they don't even give them to me anymore because i'm just like yeah this is super weird i really just
[6946.44 --> 6954.36]  don't think i'm gonna i i actually okay i i have to confess i almost went once when i found out about
[6954.36 --> 6958.52]  the wedding invitation thing because apparently they just would never give them to me i was like oh
[6958.52 --> 6964.76]  that's hilarious we should do a channel super fun where we all show up you wedding crash just the
[6964.76 --> 6973.80]  whole gang the entire company we have a response from them too um sorry we have a response from who
[6973.80 --> 6982.68]  um from our new couple um he said yes tell linus and luke i am so so happy and really appreciate of
[6982.68 --> 6989.72]  their help appreciative of their help awesome um but anyway that would actually be very funny i was
[6989.72 --> 6996.36]  talked out of it because it would also be uh very disruptive i mean there's family there and the venue
[6996.36 --> 7002.20]  would have no idea that this is happening and like like i would just not the idea was that i would just
[7002.20 --> 7013.40]  not rsvp and then we would just show up it would be really funny though it'd be really funny anyway the
[7013.40 --> 7018.60]  point is don't invite me to your wedding because we're not doing that i was talked down yeah yeah
[7021.32 --> 7029.24]  uh judge protects anonymity of eight redditors so the background here is a group of film studios were
[7029.24 --> 7034.76]  trying to prove that internet service provider astound was turning a blind eye to piracy committed
[7034.76 --> 7041.32]  by its customers they demanded that reddit unmask the identity of certain users who commented on posts
[7041.32 --> 7048.12]  about piracy including they wanted the ip address registration and logs from january 1st 2016 to
[7048.12 --> 7053.48]  present they wanted the name email address and other account registration information reddit provided
[7053.48 --> 7059.16]  some information on at least one user but refused to unmask the rest leading the studios
[7059.16 --> 7065.48]  to file a subpoena reddit responded that this was a fishing expedition four of the users never
[7065.48 --> 7070.60]  mentioned astound two mentioned astound but weren't talking about copyright infringement and one user's
[7070.60 --> 7077.56]  comment was from 2014 outside the time frame of the lawsuit in american law anonymous communication
[7077.56 --> 7081.48]  has traditionally been protected as part of the right to free speech because it shields people
[7081.48 --> 7086.52]  expressing unpopular opinions from potential retribution the judge ruled that the studios had not
[7086.52 --> 7092.84]  demonstrated a compelling need to overrule the user's free speech rights so there you have it um you
[7092.84 --> 7098.28]  can still talk about piracy on reddit including naming your isp i don't know how long that'll last but
[7101.96 --> 7107.56]  every once in a while something goes right speaking of which uh biofire is getting ready to release
[7108.20 --> 7115.08]  america's first commercial smart gun oh what uh they're a startup they're launching a smart gun
[7115.08 --> 7121.48]  with facial recognition and fingerprint unlock that will fire only for registered users okay well
[7121.48 --> 7126.76]  this is bs yeah don't worry we're getting to that okay the gun will be available as soon as the fourth
[7126.76 --> 7131.48]  quarter of this year making it potentially the first commercially available smart gun in the us there are
[7131.48 --> 7139.08]  however smart guns available abroad just can you relax abroad abroad that require the user to wear a linked
[7139.08 --> 7145.24]  smart watch or similar device so the shtick here is that it's using fingerprint and facial recognition
[7145.96 --> 7151.48]  60 of gun owners apparently say they would be interested in a smart gun uh and the potential for the
[7151.48 --> 7156.28]  technology has been around for a long time in 2000 both colt and smith and wesson agreed to create
[7156.28 --> 7163.64]  government-sponsored smart guns but they were boycotted by gun owners um and evidently that never happened
[7163.64 --> 7172.04]  now there is some concern around these products that they may not fire when needed and during a demonstration
[7172.04 --> 7180.68]  earlier this week klopfer uh okay i guess that's the name uh fired the gun then another demonstrator picked
[7180.68 --> 7188.52]  it up pulled the trigger and nothing happened when klopfer took the gun again it failed to fire twice then fired correctly
[7188.52 --> 7191.56]  a second prototype worked as expected
[7193.96 --> 7200.84]  you have 20 seconds to comply okay luke now you can talk about the smart gun it's just it's not true
[7200.84 --> 7207.16]  it's not the first what do you mean these have existed in america in america i don't care you think america's
[7207.16 --> 7214.92]  not gonna have a gun like gun exists in world gun in america these have to be true at the same time
[7214.92 --> 7222.12]  i like i don't i don't care it's just not true there's like there's videos of people defeating
[7222.12 --> 7229.32]  these from years ago the the first one i remember somebody just took a magnet they they held the the
[7229.32 --> 7234.44]  the pistol and they just took a magnet and they went bonk and then it fired no matter what it just
[7234.44 --> 7241.16]  immediately was just steel yeah it just immediately defeated it these have not only existed but they have
[7241.16 --> 7249.24]  been terrible for years like it's like we are the first to release and i can't believe the amount
[7249.24 --> 7255.48]  of coverage they got on this i googled firearm requires fingerprint to fire and it's everywhere
[7255.48 --> 7262.68]  all from just this one how biofire got this coverage is wild when no they are not first to market
[7263.56 --> 7271.00]  i can't believe people would lie on the internet it's wild i think the facial recognition thing
[7271.00 --> 7277.56]  like sure but where do you define smart like what yours is smart because it's fingerprint and facial
[7277.56 --> 7282.76]  recognition the previous ones weren't smart because they were just fingerprint what if someone requires
[7282.76 --> 7290.36]  like something else what if someone requires like a 2fa code i say it's smart when it has like chat gpt
[7290.36 --> 7297.32]  integration and chat you have to talk it out of shooting you chat gpt has evolved to the point
[7297.32 --> 7308.68]  where it doesn't tell you to kill yourself so i want like a really you know top functioning
[7309.56 --> 7315.16]  you know large language model that you know will kind of advise me on the proper use of it you know
[7315.16 --> 7321.56]  maybe maybe that's smart that's not a smart gun bullets on the blockchain oh no
[7321.56 --> 7329.88]  oh anyway that was the whole reason that i wanted this topic in here so that i could talk about chat gpt on a gun
[7333.00 --> 7338.76]  and i think it's time for us to move on to when show after hours which is basically more of that
[7340.44 --> 7346.60]  for better or for worse help we have a new banner for that i'm gonna click this button and let's see if it
[7346.60 --> 7355.16]  does anything hey now i get to get up hey there we go cool wow did that even change the the corner
[7355.16 --> 7362.20]  the corner oh my god it says after dark hundred okay i'm sure glad you rip one no actually why does
[7362.20 --> 7370.36]  it smell like fart um did you did you crap yourself no because that's a possibility i mean you technically
[7370.36 --> 7381.32]  didn't ask me if i crapped myself so that's not ruled out yet oh my goodness that was wild okay anyways um
[7383.16 --> 7386.12]  march messages i'm gonna start trying to i've already been trying to respond to some of them
[7386.12 --> 7392.68]  through text i'm gonna jump in and try to do more now we will fall into our formation yeah if you guys
[7392.68 --> 7398.36]  want to deal with some potentials i'll start yelling at you with your curated okay here we go dear linus
[7398.36 --> 7405.88]  being very busy ceo of lmg and trying to eat healthy feed a family sounds very hard have you
[7405.88 --> 7413.48]  ever thought of hiring a private chef sincerely someone who makes food for money um the only reason
[7413.48 --> 7419.80]  that i haven't is that i don't want my kids to grow up with a chef yeah i feel i don't necessarily know
[7419.80 --> 7425.40]  that we've talked about that but i knew that answer yeah yeah i mean yeah and i respect that i
[7425.40 --> 7432.04]  well the thing is like okay that i'm gonna play devil's advocate against myself right now because
[7432.68 --> 7441.88]  um what if by having a private chef my kids were exposed to far more variety in their diet and
[7441.88 --> 7448.36]  healthier food um you know yvonne and i would never be an interesting way to do it maybe is if you had
[7448.36 --> 7455.56]  your kids cook with the private chef if it was like a cooking tutor okay cooking tutor sure um but
[7455.56 --> 7463.56]  i mean okay sure maybe uh look i'll i don't know i'll get to that in a second whatever but like
[7463.56 --> 7469.96]  realistically you know yvonne and i are like any other both parents work family and sometimes uh
[7470.52 --> 7476.36]  like one thing we're really good about is we always send our kids to school with lunch uh so they never go
[7476.36 --> 7482.60]  to the cafeteria even though that is technically an option um so they always bring a bring bring food
[7482.60 --> 7489.32]  from home um but occasionally that food ain't great you know we'll be up at midnight and we're kind of
[7489.32 --> 7494.60]  going oh holy crap we don't have anything for lunches tomorrow and we'll like just whip up some annie's
[7494.60 --> 7501.00]  you know mac and cheese or whatever and throw it in a throw it in a thermos all right kids enjoy i mean
[7501.00 --> 7506.12]  they love it obviously but it's not good for them it's not healthy right it's got so much sodium in it
[7506.12 --> 7509.80]  i have no idea but i would assume annie's is better than like a craft and dinner thing well
[7509.80 --> 7516.60]  sometimes they get craft dinner too right fair enough you know right and so from a from a from a
[7516.60 --> 7525.32]  what's what's healthier for your children is it to is it to eat the healthiest food that builds the best
[7525.32 --> 7532.12]  brain function and and body function and and growth or is it to you know live on the in the real world
[7532.12 --> 7539.72]  where people don't actually have a chef that makes them food every day right um would would they end up
[7539.72 --> 7546.44]  more helpless i mean i think your idea of having having them help with food prep is great in theory
[7546.44 --> 7552.20]  but i can tell you we have lots of great ideas in theory like i have the idea in theory of creating
[7552.20 --> 7557.08]  some kind of bonus system where if you're the first one dressed and downstairs and eating your breakfast
[7557.08 --> 7562.04]  then you get some kind of star that gets you some kind of reward because positive reinforcement
[7562.04 --> 7565.80]  works so much better than negative reinforcement but in practice it's early and i'm tired and i'm
[7565.80 --> 7571.24]  just gonna say get downstairs we gotta go like you just yell at them right like so it's
[7573.96 --> 7581.24]  yes but realistically if the kids are not helpful that day or busy they're still gonna make the food
[7581.24 --> 7586.52]  whatever and kids are smart they're gonna figure that out oh i'm conveniently busy yeah oh i have
[7586.52 --> 7591.40]  to go to the bathroom one of my middle child is like the queen of that uh okay guys need to empty
[7591.40 --> 7595.88]  the dishwasher uh okay you have to go to the bathroom and then the dishwasher is three quarters
[7595.88 --> 7600.92]  empty by the time she comes back she puts away two things and she's like i helped and i'm like yeah uh
[7600.92 --> 7606.12]  you're looking at the king of that trick go do something else i used to be really bad for that
[7606.12 --> 7611.32]  and my family thought it was intentional but i just have really intense gamer bladder and i would stand
[7611.32 --> 7616.52]  up for the first time after a very long time and then actually just need to go to the washroom and
[7616.52 --> 7621.32]  i used to get in arguments where i'd be like just leave a bunch of it for me like i'm not i'm not trying
[7621.32 --> 7625.56]  to avoid it i'm not saying that's what's happening here but definitely not yeah that used to happen to me
[7627.16 --> 7634.84]  all right next up okay do you have any comment on all the eight gigabits of vram not being enough
[7634.84 --> 7643.72]  conversations it's gigabytes but um i mean yeah yeah this happens all the time game developers keep
[7643.72 --> 7649.80]  you know pushing the envelope and graphics card manufacturers i mean okay so you gotta you gotta
[7649.80 --> 7658.44]  look at what is a gpu right you've got the sand in the middle the gpu itself and that the intellectual
[7658.44 --> 7666.76]  property is mostly owned by your amd your nvidia or your intel so the the the manufacturer uh some of
[7666.76 --> 7672.04]  the ip may be co-developed with a samsung or a tsmc or whatever else for that particular chip but but
[7672.04 --> 7680.36]  largely the ip is owned by that designer of that silicon and so while there's a lot of cost associated
[7680.36 --> 7686.76]  with it to the board manufacturer or to you the consumer the actual cost on that is largely in the
[7686.76 --> 7695.08]  development of it right now there is obviously what they pay for silicon wafers from a tsmc or a samsung
[7695.08 --> 7703.16]  but a lot of that cost is intellectual property so there's great margin in it is what i'm trying to say
[7704.12 --> 7712.04]  ram on the other hand is not the intellectual property of nvidia or amd they help contribute to
[7712.04 --> 7719.80]  standards like graphics ddr or hbm i think to a degree but they don't own that and so when they buy
[7719.80 --> 7725.96]  ram they buy it from samsung or micron or whoever else there's a lot less margin in buying commodity
[7725.96 --> 7731.32]  memory and strapping it to a board there's also basically no margin in integration of things like
[7731.32 --> 7741.00]  heat sinks and pcbs like vrms right so then with all that in mind if i am trying to reduce my
[7741.64 --> 7747.64]  my total bill of materials does it make sense to build a crappier gpu or do i want to put a really
[7747.64 --> 7753.72]  good gpu on it that has lots of cool ai tech that helps me sell my product or do i want to downgrade
[7753.72 --> 7759.56]  the memory that has a much bigger cost and is much less marketable well i don't want to put on any more
[7759.56 --> 7764.44]  frame buffer than i absolutely have to that memory so that's where they're going to try and they're going
[7764.44 --> 7769.80]  to try and lower their bomb cost or the bill of materials cost for the graphics card for the completed
[7769.80 --> 7775.00]  card nvidia does spend money in weird ways sometimes like when they first started putting
[7775.00 --> 7781.00]  these super high-end coolers on their cards i guess this is back in the 700 series these like cast
[7781.00 --> 7788.36]  aluminum uh heat sink shrouds and like these really fancy you know machined back plates and stuff uh i i
[7788.36 --> 7792.92]  it kind of never made sense to me because i'm sitting here going like oh well that's that's unnecessary
[7792.92 --> 7797.16]  that doesn't contribute to performance that's very non-traditional and then you know they go and do
[7797.16 --> 7803.16]  weird things like the three and a half gig ram thing with the 900 series um so is it necessarily
[7803.16 --> 7810.20]  the best uh is is it the best plan for them to cost up a heat sink and cost down on memory i i don't know
[7810.20 --> 7819.56]  i i'm not an engineer but i can tell the community is not happy about it and yeah more vram is absolutely
[7819.56 --> 7825.16]  a great way to future proof your purchase but i will say this too it feels like it's making a bigger
[7825.16 --> 7831.32]  difference right now than i'm used to it making in the past we've seen two and four gig versions four
[7831.32 --> 7836.28]  and eight gig versions of the same cards many time in the past many times in the past and the general
[7836.28 --> 7843.32]  rule often has been that by the time that vram is a limitation for you realistically the performance
[7843.32 --> 7848.84]  of that gpu is going to be a bigger limitation but we're seeing people modifying these graphics cards
[7848.84 --> 7854.44]  putting extra memory on them and getting much better performance and that's over the last couple of
[7854.44 --> 7861.48]  generations now so yeah i can i can see some justification for amd's snark that they've
[7861.48 --> 7866.60]  been throwing at nvidia about how they've been kind of cheaping out on video frame buffer i just got a
[7866.60 --> 7874.68]  message from our community uh coordinator oh could you mention this on behalf of the ltt folding team
[7875.24 --> 7881.72]  it's on the wanshow oh yeah yeah i missed it because it was buried with the merch stuff yep ltt is
[7881.72 --> 7888.60]  competing in the boink pentathlon uh it's a two-week competition where teams lend their unused processing
[7888.60 --> 7894.12]  power to perform calculations for five different projects in science physics and mathematics ltt has
[7894.12 --> 7899.80]  competed only twice before with our best rank being sixth overall in 2021 the event has been running for
[7899.80 --> 7904.84]  around 24 hours at this point we're currently in sixth place there are over a thousand dollars of prizes
[7904.84 --> 7910.36]  prizes up for grabs um and if you're up to the challenge you can come on and join the team prizes include
[7910.36 --> 7916.84]  10 100 ltt store gift cards and a handful of steam gift cards prizes are a raffle from all active participants
[7917.48 --> 7922.92]  so no matter how powerful your computer is you have the same chance to win the link will be posted in chat
[7923.48 --> 7931.24]  and i will do that now pretty awesome this is one of the things this is the kind of thing that we want our community
[7931.24 --> 7935.96]  coordinator doing because it's like it's not like we don't want to throw prizing at the community and
[7935.96 --> 7941.48]  support these kinds of things it's just that i don't personally have time to oversee it so i i need
[7941.48 --> 7946.92]  someone to actually follow up and you know send out prizing and that sort of thing this is great
[7946.92 --> 7954.52]  fantastic thank you very much for the reminder i was going to say name but i think this individual is
[7954.52 --> 7963.80]  not of probation cool hit me again sure thing hey llnd love the show a question luke might be able to
[7963.80 --> 7970.04]  answer i bought some bird seed recently how long does it take for the birds to grow once i plant them
[7970.04 --> 7971.56]  the cashier couldn't answer me
[7975.08 --> 7979.08]  what how long that's not it's not you feed it to the birds
[7979.08 --> 7981.16]  oh you're a bad person uh you're a bad person uh you're a bad person i'm not a bad person
[7981.16 --> 7987.96]  i'm a security professional at a game company finding it infuriating the uber ciso skated on his
[7987.96 --> 8008.44]  cybercrime charges there you go are you worried about being held liable for one of your employees
[8009.08 --> 8013.74]  did I miss something here?
[8014.14 --> 8015.72]  I was replying to a text one.
[8016.08 --> 8017.04]  I think we,
[8017.14 --> 8018.14]  for one of your employees,
[8018.40 --> 8020.34]  I don't know if we technically know the full story there.
[8020.44 --> 8021.90]  Is Uber getting pinned with this?
[8021.96 --> 8022.76]  Is that what's going on?
[8023.20 --> 8024.04]  I don't know.
[8025.10 --> 8025.46]  Um,
[8025.86 --> 8028.66]  are you worried about being held liable for one of your employees?
[8028.74 --> 8028.92]  I mean,
[8028.96 --> 8029.22]  yeah,
[8029.84 --> 8031.12]  absolutely.
[8032.42 --> 8033.38]  Like it is,
[8033.48 --> 8033.98]  it is,
[8034.06 --> 8039.06]  it is totally possible for someone here to say something or,
[8039.08 --> 8042.08]  or do something that could maybe not legally,
[8042.86 --> 8044.08]  um,
[8044.32 --> 8045.36]  cause problems for me,
[8045.44 --> 8047.94]  but absolutely perceptually cause problems.
[8047.94 --> 8048.82]  Like I think if,
[8049.28 --> 8052.84]  if someone here came out as some kind of hyper toxic,
[8053.60 --> 8054.24]  um,
[8054.40 --> 8054.78]  you know,
[8055.18 --> 8056.04]  like let's,
[8056.12 --> 8056.36]  let's,
[8056.44 --> 8059.28]  let's pick something sort of unequivocally bad,
[8059.28 --> 8062.00]  like a Nazi supporter or something like that.
[8062.50 --> 8062.90]  Um,
[8062.92 --> 8066.90]  I think that if we didn't take any kind of action that could,
[8066.90 --> 8070.08]  that could reflect really poorly on our company and on me personally.
[8070.56 --> 8072.02]  So yeah,
[8072.14 --> 8072.62]  definitely.
[8072.62 --> 8074.16]  It's something that we're concerned about.
[8074.16 --> 8078.20]  And it's something that we try to try to be cognizant of as we're,
[8078.26 --> 8079.80]  as we're continuing to build our team,
[8079.80 --> 8083.06]  as we want to make sure that to the greatest degree we can,
[8083.18 --> 8083.68]  um,
[8083.68 --> 8086.00]  everyone who works here is like kind of awesome.
[8086.40 --> 8086.68]  You know,
[8086.68 --> 8087.04]  that's,
[8087.04 --> 8088.20]  I think a pretty,
[8089.40 --> 8090.58]  it shouldn't be that hard,
[8090.84 --> 8091.14]  but it's,
[8091.24 --> 8092.00]  but it's difficult,
[8092.00 --> 8095.14]  but I think it's a good and worthwhile goal and something that I actually
[8095.14 --> 8098.22]  talked to our HR department about like earlier this week.
[8098.30 --> 8098.58]  It's like,
[8098.58 --> 8099.84]  what do we care about?
[8099.90 --> 8100.60]  We care about,
[8100.60 --> 8101.38]  you know,
[8101.38 --> 8102.54]  working with people that,
[8102.58 --> 8102.82]  you know,
[8102.82 --> 8104.18]  want to be here and want to,
[8104.58 --> 8104.78]  and,
[8104.82 --> 8105.20]  and are,
[8105.28 --> 8106.42]  are excited about,
[8106.66 --> 8106.92]  you know,
[8106.92 --> 8108.46]  what they're doing and what our mission is,
[8108.46 --> 8108.64]  right?
[8108.64 --> 8114.46]  Which is to make consumer electronics and technology more exciting and more
[8114.46 --> 8115.34]  accessible to people.
[8115.50 --> 8117.78]  If you don't care about that and you don't want that,
[8117.86 --> 8121.04]  then you should go work somewhere else where they do something that you do
[8121.04 --> 8123.02]  want to do and that you are excited about.
[8123.28 --> 8124.30]  Like that's fine,
[8124.72 --> 8125.48]  right?
[8125.54 --> 8126.70]  You don't have to work here.
[8127.48 --> 8127.92]  Yeah.
[8129.06 --> 8129.30]  Okay.
[8129.34 --> 8129.76]  Up next.
[8130.20 --> 8130.38]  Hi,
[8130.48 --> 8134.92]  LLD thoughts on licensure for software or electronics engineers,
[8134.92 --> 8137.80]  like the more traditional engineering disciplines,
[8137.80 --> 8142.54]  ethics rules could require that engineers don't enact anti-consumer practices,
[8142.74 --> 8143.30]  for example.
[8144.86 --> 8145.34]  Okay.
[8145.96 --> 8152.26]  So this is a whole thing where engineer can be a protected term where you can't
[8152.26 --> 8156.94]  call yourself an engineer unless you have gone through a particular program and,
[8157.04 --> 8161.74]  or you are a member of a particular organization that,
[8161.74 --> 8162.42]  um,
[8162.44 --> 8164.34]  has its own sort of internal,
[8164.34 --> 8165.18]  uh,
[8165.18 --> 8167.96]  governing rules for your behavior.
[8168.76 --> 8169.28]  Um,
[8169.48 --> 8173.54]  I think it would be super cool if,
[8173.74 --> 8174.16]  you know,
[8174.16 --> 8177.40]  the engineering body had rules like,
[8177.70 --> 8178.44]  yeah,
[8178.54 --> 8184.32]  members who want to call themselves engineer cannot enact anti-consumer practices,
[8184.32 --> 8191.94]  but they would basically just create a situation where every licensed engineer or certified
[8191.94 --> 8192.52]  engineer,
[8192.64 --> 8193.70]  whatever you want to call it,
[8193.70 --> 8194.50]  um,
[8194.50 --> 8198.04]  would be utterly unemployable because many companies,
[8198.04 --> 8200.42]  and it's a,
[8200.42 --> 8201.28]  it's a weird thing,
[8201.28 --> 8206.96]  but many companies seem to put themselves on opposite sides of a struggle with their
[8206.96 --> 8207.44]  customers,
[8207.44 --> 8208.44]  um,
[8208.44 --> 8210.50]  for how they can extract more money from them.
[8210.50 --> 8210.74]  Right.
[8210.88 --> 8212.92]  And so I think that it would be,
[8212.92 --> 8213.72]  it's noble,
[8214.00 --> 8216.12]  but I don't think it's realistic.
[8216.44 --> 8220.34]  I was having a similar conversation about this with someone very recently,
[8220.34 --> 8220.86]  actually,
[8220.86 --> 8224.72]  where it was basically along the lines of,
[8224.82 --> 8224.92]  yeah,
[8224.96 --> 8228.04]  it would be great if everyone kind of came together and said,
[8228.10 --> 8228.50]  you know what,
[8228.50 --> 8229.56]  let's not do that anymore.
[8229.56 --> 8230.56]  Um,
[8231.56 --> 8233.38]  oh man,
[8233.48 --> 8234.22]  what was it?
[8235.34 --> 8236.52]  It was Microsoft.
[8237.56 --> 8240.30]  If Microsoft could put pressure on,
[8240.30 --> 8241.56]  uh,
[8244.66 --> 8245.04]  it was something,
[8245.12 --> 8246.60]  it was like some kind of like awful,
[8246.60 --> 8247.62]  like software,
[8247.90 --> 8249.78]  software behavior or something like that.
[8249.88 --> 8250.60]  And I was like,
[8250.62 --> 8250.78]  yeah,
[8250.84 --> 8251.82]  that would be great.
[8251.86 --> 8252.52]  But it just,
[8252.62 --> 8252.74]  yeah,
[8252.78 --> 8252.98]  it was,
[8253.08 --> 8253.86]  it was the same answer,
[8253.90 --> 8254.04]  right?
[8254.04 --> 8254.38]  It's just,
[8254.46 --> 8255.34]  it's just not realistic.
[8255.82 --> 8257.10]  They'll find another way around.
[8258.32 --> 8259.24]  Exploiter's going to exploit.
[8259.56 --> 8264.28]  Keep the new desk pad designs coming.
[8264.78 --> 8265.20]  Question.
[8265.42 --> 8271.02]  Are there any products on LTT store.com that you would consider a flop or
[8271.02 --> 8274.98]  underperformer or any products that were better than expected?
[8275.84 --> 8279.06]  The towels are better than expected.
[8279.72 --> 8280.62]  Everybody needs towels.
[8280.62 --> 8282.40]  We've sold like a hundred towels today.
[8282.98 --> 8283.58]  Like what?
[8284.56 --> 8285.34]  Buy towels.
[8285.46 --> 8285.62]  I mean,
[8285.66 --> 8285.80]  yeah,
[8285.80 --> 8288.26]  they've got a cool keyboard design and they're good towels.
[8288.40 --> 8289.42]  I'm not like,
[8289.42 --> 8291.64]  I'm not down on the towels or anything.
[8292.26 --> 8294.04]  I just thinking about getting some towels to be honest.
[8294.14 --> 8295.22]  Mine are a little older.
[8295.34 --> 8295.50]  Yeah.
[8295.52 --> 8296.76]  I need new towels as well.
[8296.88 --> 8297.12]  Yeah.
[8297.12 --> 8298.16]  Everybody needs towels.
[8298.30 --> 8302.64]  Like maybe it's just one of those things where sometimes accidentally we just kind of go,
[8302.72 --> 8303.40]  man,
[8303.46 --> 8304.62]  shopping for towels sucks.
[8304.92 --> 8305.12]  Yeah.
[8305.22 --> 8306.80]  What if there was just a place to get,
[8306.88 --> 8307.46]  you know,
[8307.52 --> 8308.58]  towels at the,
[8308.76 --> 8309.00]  you know,
[8309.00 --> 8310.00]  you just know they're going to be good.
[8310.00 --> 8310.78]  Reasonable price.
[8310.92 --> 8311.06]  Yeah.
[8311.12 --> 8312.12]  Any size you want.
[8312.68 --> 8313.04]  Um,
[8313.26 --> 8314.48]  I don't know.
[8314.60 --> 8315.38]  I don't get it.
[8315.38 --> 8316.10]  Cause we,
[8316.18 --> 8316.52]  we,
[8316.52 --> 8318.32]  we had got them back in stock last week,
[8318.32 --> 8318.70]  I think.
[8318.70 --> 8321.64]  And they've just been crushing it since then.
[8322.22 --> 8322.44]  Um,
[8322.44 --> 8323.30]  as for flops,
[8323.30 --> 8323.80]  flops,
[8323.80 --> 8324.44]  Oh man,
[8324.44 --> 8326.06]  I could tell you about some flops.
[8326.34 --> 8330.26]  Our first attempt at women's clothing was a pretty big flop.
[8330.36 --> 8330.52]  I mean,
[8330.52 --> 8332.26]  the reviews are pretty good for the,
[8332.26 --> 8332.52]  uh,
[8332.52 --> 8334.52]  the original sweatpants and cropped hoodie,
[8334.68 --> 8336.88]  but the sales have not,
[8337.00 --> 8341.08]  not been very strong.
[8341.90 --> 8343.68]  I can tell you guys that much.
[8344.00 --> 8344.48]  Uh,
[8344.48 --> 8344.70]  I mean,
[8344.70 --> 8346.58]  there's a lot of stuff that's kind of middling.
[8346.70 --> 8349.48]  I think that we're going to have to come up with some,
[8350.08 --> 8350.42]  actually,
[8350.46 --> 8350.80]  you know what?
[8350.80 --> 8351.10]  Why don't,
[8351.18 --> 8351.94]  why don't we talk about it?
[8352.78 --> 8358.98]  The one time that we've kind of taken it to price on products from LTT store was,
[8358.98 --> 8359.70]  um,
[8360.00 --> 8360.68]  black Friday.
[8361.02 --> 8366.38]  And I think what we'll probably do is continue to have that be like,
[8366.98 --> 8367.26]  you know,
[8367.34 --> 8368.94]  the time that we'll run,
[8368.94 --> 8369.30]  you know,
[8369.34 --> 8370.80]  price promos or whatever else.
[8371.10 --> 8371.42]  Uh,
[8371.44 --> 8372.88]  but there may be one other time.
[8373.06 --> 8377.74]  And I think we're going to kind of piggyback on prime day and we're going to do lime day.
[8377.74 --> 8381.58]  They might not be sweet deals,
[8381.76 --> 8384.34]  but they're sour and tangy in a delightful way.
[8385.10 --> 8386.26]  That's like kind of,
[8386.32 --> 8388.80]  kind of what I'm thinking for it.
[8389.76 --> 8390.40]  Lime day.
[8390.94 --> 8392.32]  So maybe what we'll do is we'll-
[8392.32 --> 8393.78]  So like nothing actually gets discounted,
[8394.02 --> 8394.60]  but there's like-
[8394.60 --> 8394.66]  No,
[8394.66 --> 8395.34]  it'll be good though.
[8395.48 --> 8395.92]  Bundles?
[8396.56 --> 8396.80]  No,
[8396.98 --> 8397.14]  no,
[8397.14 --> 8397.28]  no,
[8397.34 --> 8397.52]  no,
[8397.58 --> 8397.72]  no,
[8397.78 --> 8397.92]  no,
[8397.92 --> 8398.02]  no.
[8398.02 --> 8399.04]  I'm talking just like,
[8399.22 --> 8399.40]  well,
[8399.44 --> 8400.42]  we'll take stuff that's like,
[8400.48 --> 8400.62]  yeah,
[8400.62 --> 8402.52]  this isn't really working and just blast it away.
[8403.12 --> 8403.52]  Yep.
[8404.02 --> 8404.26]  Uh,
[8404.26 --> 8404.42]  I,
[8404.42 --> 8405.10]  I expect-
[8405.10 --> 8405.76]  Isn't that how like,
[8405.78 --> 8406.42]  do they all work?
[8406.84 --> 8407.22]  Yeah.
[8407.74 --> 8409.12]  That's what we did on Black Friday.
[8409.58 --> 8409.78]  Yeah,
[8409.80 --> 8411.26]  but isn't that what like everybody does?
[8412.30 --> 8412.62]  Um,
[8412.94 --> 8413.26]  I mean,
[8413.38 --> 8413.56]  well,
[8413.60 --> 8413.82]  no,
[8413.90 --> 8416.60]  because Amazon just hikes the price up in the month leading up to it.
[8416.78 --> 8416.84]  Ah.
[8417.80 --> 8418.54]  So I'm saying we won't do that.
[8418.54 --> 8419.68]  So you're not going to like lie about it.
[8419.88 --> 8420.12]  No.
[8420.24 --> 8420.44]  Yeah,
[8420.50 --> 8420.70]  cool.
[8420.86 --> 8421.02]  Oh,
[8421.02 --> 8421.16]  no,
[8421.16 --> 8421.28]  no,
[8421.28 --> 8421.38]  no,
[8421.44 --> 8421.60]  we'll,
[8421.70 --> 8422.02]  no,
[8422.02 --> 8422.46]  we're going to,
[8422.58 --> 8423.76]  if we discount something,
[8423.86 --> 8427.20]  it's because this is the normal price and we are blowing it away.
[8427.46 --> 8427.66]  Yeah.
[8427.78 --> 8431.02]  So you're going to have to move pretty fast if you want to get your hands on any of that stuff.
[8431.10 --> 8431.24]  I,
[8431.30 --> 8433.44]  I don't know which,
[8433.44 --> 8434.00]  uh,
[8434.00 --> 8434.90]  items we're going to do.
[8434.90 --> 8439.68]  I think I have a meeting with Nick next week to figure out what kind of things we're going to run for Lime Day.
[8439.68 --> 8440.82]  Um,
[8441.78 --> 8443.86]  but I do have some candidates in mind.
[8444.10 --> 8444.70]  Some stuff,
[8444.96 --> 8445.30]  okay,
[8445.42 --> 8447.68]  I'd say our sweatband set hasn't been a smash hit.
[8447.78 --> 8449.02]  We've never restocked it.
[8449.44 --> 8452.14]  We're still sitting on like thousands of units from our initial order,
[8452.28 --> 8453.40]  but they're sweatbands.
[8453.50 --> 8454.64]  They don't take up a ton of space.
[8455.06 --> 8456.78]  They have reasonable margins,
[8456.78 --> 8458.60]  so they don't cost a ton to store.
[8458.82 --> 8461.86]  We make money on them and they're well reviewed.
[8462.00 --> 8463.00]  So it's not like we're,
[8463.10 --> 8464.10]  it's not like they're a problem.
[8464.32 --> 8464.76]  They're just,
[8465.02 --> 8466.26]  you know,
[8466.70 --> 8467.66]  selling a little bit slowly.
[8467.66 --> 8468.46]  So that's fine.
[8468.46 --> 8470.76]  There.
[8473.08 --> 8473.56]  Okay.
[8473.72 --> 8480.24]  I LLD tech like AR and interactive content has transformed my industry broadcast media.
[8480.42 --> 8484.96]  Are there any technologies that have fundamentally transformed how LTT operates?
[8485.36 --> 8485.52]  Um,
[8485.58 --> 8488.32]  and is there any horizon besides AI?
[8489.32 --> 8495.20]  I'd say the biggest one that's impacting us right now and will continue to impact us is,
[8495.38 --> 8496.02]  well,
[8496.20 --> 8496.42]  okay,
[8496.42 --> 8497.28]  you say besides AI,
[8497.42 --> 8497.84]  but too bad.
[8497.84 --> 8498.60]  Uh,
[8498.60 --> 8503.54]  is the ability to reach new audiences through AI generated,
[8503.54 --> 8504.42]  um,
[8504.54 --> 8505.10]  transcription,
[8505.96 --> 8506.56]  translation,
[8506.56 --> 8508.86]  and voice generation.
[8508.86 --> 8511.76]  Because at our scale,
[8512.00 --> 8512.78]  it's just,
[8512.96 --> 8513.58]  yeah,
[8513.66 --> 8517.04]  obviously I'd love to hire dedicated translation teams and,
[8517.04 --> 8522.12]  and professional voice actors for every possible dialect of every possible language,
[8522.12 --> 8523.70]  but it's not feasible.
[8523.70 --> 8524.70]  If we're,
[8525.08 --> 8526.56]  we are not Mr.
[8526.56 --> 8526.94]  Beast,
[8527.72 --> 8528.06]  right?
[8528.12 --> 8532.70]  If there's a hundred million speakers of one language and we're getting a hundred thousand
[8532.70 --> 8533.40]  views of our,
[8533.56 --> 8533.68]  okay,
[8533.68 --> 8533.96]  let's,
[8534.02 --> 8534.52]  let's take Mr.
[8534.52 --> 8534.70]  Beast.
[8534.78 --> 8534.92]  Okay.
[8534.92 --> 8535.10]  Right.
[8535.16 --> 8536.10]  So you've got however many,
[8536.18 --> 8537.84]  like a billion plus English speakers.
[8537.84 --> 8542.08]  If he takes his video and he translates it for a billion,
[8542.40 --> 8542.76]  you know,
[8542.98 --> 8543.34]  uh,
[8543.34 --> 8544.22]  Hindi speakers,
[8544.22 --> 8546.06]  he can double his views,
[8546.06 --> 8549.50]  which would be 30 or 40 million views of video.
[8549.84 --> 8551.06]  That cost is,
[8551.06 --> 8551.26]  is,
[8551.26 --> 8552.26]  is negligible.
[8552.26 --> 8557.28]  Whereas if we take our English viewership and we translate it to,
[8557.48 --> 8559.22]  let's say Portuguese.
[8559.62 --> 8559.92]  Okay.
[8559.92 --> 8561.62]  So we get millions,
[8561.76 --> 8564.88]  but not hundreds of millions and certainly not a billion,
[8564.88 --> 8565.22]  right.
[8565.22 --> 8567.22]  Compared to our English speaking audience or,
[8567.26 --> 8568.84]  or English accessible audience,
[8568.84 --> 8570.54]  all of a sudden,
[8570.68 --> 8570.90]  okay,
[8570.90 --> 8574.24]  if we can get a million or 2 million views,
[8574.30 --> 8575.72]  maybe we get like 200,000.
[8577.32 --> 8579.70]  Those economics don't make any sense.
[8579.70 --> 8580.64]  So,
[8580.64 --> 8581.62]  and even,
[8581.74 --> 8582.74]  even for something like Hindi,
[8582.74 --> 8586.92]  they don't necessarily make sense because the CPMs for views in those
[8586.92 --> 8590.06]  languages and views in those regions are so much lower that it's not like
[8590.06 --> 8591.26]  you're just doubling your reach.
[8591.78 --> 8592.98]  So for us,
[8592.98 --> 8597.64]  we need tools that make it more cost effective for us to support more
[8597.64 --> 8598.06]  languages.
[8598.06 --> 8601.90]  And I'd say that's going to probably not double our business,
[8601.90 --> 8605.98]  but could help us grow 10 or 20% just by,
[8606.12 --> 8608.50]  by reaching a broader audience over the next couple of years,
[8608.50 --> 8610.10]  as we work that into our workflow.
[8613.14 --> 8616.26]  Apparently there are only approximately 350 million Hindi speakers.
[8616.86 --> 8618.76]  So I guess a lot of Punjabi as well.
[8618.88 --> 8621.18]  I don't know the actual like dialect split.
[8621.52 --> 8622.08]  It's a lot of people.
[8622.74 --> 8622.94]  Yeah,
[8623.00 --> 8623.48]  it's still a lot.
[8624.44 --> 8624.78]  Hey,
[8624.84 --> 8625.06]  Luke,
[8625.06 --> 8627.06]  I just read the,
[8627.28 --> 8629.04]  I just,
[8629.08 --> 8629.64]  how you doing?
[8630.02 --> 8630.26]  Yeah.
[8630.62 --> 8635.36]  I just read the news that scientists taught pet parrots to video call each
[8635.36 --> 8635.56]  other.
[8635.82 --> 8637.40]  What do you think about using tech,
[8637.52 --> 8639.46]  not to make ownership easier,
[8639.46 --> 8641.68]  but making the lives of pets easier?
[8642.00 --> 8642.78]  I think it's super cool.
[8643.00 --> 8643.12]  Yeah.
[8643.22 --> 8643.46]  Yeah.
[8643.54 --> 8643.70]  I,
[8643.70 --> 8645.48]  I don't know if I had talked to you about this.
[8645.66 --> 8646.82]  I should have sent you the article,
[8646.94 --> 8647.58]  but I probably forgot.
[8647.74 --> 8649.66]  It's actually really wild.
[8650.16 --> 8650.36]  They,
[8650.44 --> 8653.04]  they taught parrots to video call each other.
[8653.04 --> 8658.88]  And they found that over time they made friends and those friends would more
[8658.88 --> 8660.44]  frequently call each other.
[8660.56 --> 8664.22]  So it wasn't necessarily even just that the one would like learn to press the
[8664.22 --> 8667.26]  one button more easily because the other one would also be like,
[8667.34 --> 8667.40]  Oh,
[8667.42 --> 8668.22]  this one's my friend.
[8668.30 --> 8670.06]  So it would call that one back as well.
[8670.44 --> 8674.30]  And they would like go get their toys and like show their friend on the video
[8674.30 --> 8675.00]  call the toy.
[8675.12 --> 8678.32]  And they seem to understand that their friend is only in this thing,
[8678.32 --> 8680.56]  but they can like call them when they want.
[8680.98 --> 8681.14]  And like,
[8681.14 --> 8684.68]  did they introduce them in person after and see if they still recognized each
[8684.68 --> 8684.88]  other?
[8685.30 --> 8686.58]  I don't think so.
[8687.00 --> 8687.44]  Um,
[8687.70 --> 8690.90]  but like actually super cool.
[8691.10 --> 8692.18]  That's wild.
[8692.56 --> 8693.62]  And like there was clearly,
[8693.62 --> 8696.16]  they like enjoyed it and they're having fun and they're being social and all
[8696.16 --> 8696.58]  this kind of stuff.
[8696.66 --> 8696.96]  Very,
[8697.06 --> 8697.68]  very interesting.
[8698.08 --> 8698.32]  Yeah.
[8699.28 --> 8699.68]  Um,
[8700.72 --> 8701.02]  but yeah,
[8701.02 --> 8701.46]  I don't know.
[8701.56 --> 8705.24]  I mostly just wanted to explain the story of what they were basing that
[8705.24 --> 8706.20]  merch message off of,
[8706.20 --> 8707.30]  because that's super interesting.
[8707.30 --> 8707.70]  And yeah,
[8707.70 --> 8710.18]  if you can use tech to enhance the lives of your pets,
[8710.26 --> 8710.52]  why not?
[8710.52 --> 8711.26]  That sounds great.
[8711.76 --> 8712.56]  That's super cool.
[8713.62 --> 8714.68]  So yeah.
[8716.86 --> 8717.40]  Next up.
[8717.40 --> 8719.06]  I feel like I already read this one.
[8719.90 --> 8720.02]  Yeah.
[8720.82 --> 8721.74]  And okay.
[8722.18 --> 8722.32]  Hey,
[8722.36 --> 8723.90]  LLD love watching the WAN show,
[8724.02 --> 8728.38]  but how do you always keep the discussion interesting?
[8728.66 --> 8730.90]  Is there a threshold for the cutting room floor?
[8733.02 --> 8733.70]  Oh boy.
[8734.20 --> 8734.86]  I don't know.
[8735.04 --> 8735.90]  That's a good question.
[8735.90 --> 8737.20]  We can,
[8737.20 --> 8739.00]  we can be pretty vicious about topics.
[8739.60 --> 8740.04]  Yeah.
[8740.60 --> 8741.12]  I mean,
[8741.12 --> 8743.14]  you look at the way that I will sort of,
[8743.50 --> 8743.80]  okay.
[8743.80 --> 8749.96]  I think AI is a perfect example of this where Luke's patience for it was a
[8749.96 --> 8751.20]  little bit longer than mine.
[8751.20 --> 8753.18]  And it starts with,
[8753.18 --> 8754.36]  Oh no,
[8754.36 --> 8756.10]  Luke's going to talk about AI again.
[8756.30 --> 8756.96]  You know,
[8757.04 --> 8757.64]  as a,
[8757.64 --> 8758.36]  as a,
[8758.36 --> 8759.50]  as a,
[8759.50 --> 8759.86]  a,
[8759.86 --> 8761.56]  a cue as a,
[8761.56 --> 8763.02]  as a prompt that,
[8763.40 --> 8763.52]  Hey,
[8763.58 --> 8765.36]  this is probably kind of getting there.
[8765.44 --> 8766.78]  You might want to keep this one short.
[8766.78 --> 8767.68]  Like that's the,
[8767.78 --> 8771.92]  that's the unspoken undertone of the joke that I'm making.
[8771.92 --> 8775.68]  And then if he doesn't get the clue,
[8775.96 --> 8776.72]  then I'll be like,
[8777.16 --> 8777.56]  all right,
[8777.58 --> 8778.28]  let's move on.
[8778.60 --> 8780.54]  And he does the same thing to me.
[8781.20 --> 8783.66]  So I think that between the two of us,
[8783.66 --> 8789.02]  how quickly we get bored with things helps us to keep the conversation moving.
[8791.36 --> 8792.56]  And realistically,
[8792.98 --> 8793.66]  like you guys,
[8793.92 --> 8794.92]  I think,
[8795.44 --> 8799.10]  I think the cynical among you won't believe me.
[8799.10 --> 8802.86]  So you can just plug your ears and go la la la and pretend this isn't happening.
[8802.86 --> 8804.18]  But for the rest of you,
[8804.36 --> 8810.08]  this is not actually that dissimilar to what it's like when we just are on discord.
[8812.62 --> 8817.38]  He in particular swears a lot less on Wancho than he does on discord.
[8818.08 --> 8827.34]  I think neither of us is as politically correct on discord because we don't have to be and we're tired or whatever.
[8827.34 --> 8828.54]  Um,
[8829.42 --> 8829.82]  it takes,
[8829.92 --> 8830.08]  we're,
[8830.12 --> 8830.72]  we're getting older.
[8830.84 --> 8833.40]  It takes energy because I honestly just forget,
[8833.40 --> 8835.18]  like there's certain terms that aren't,
[8835.18 --> 8840.10]  it's moving really fast and it's actually kind of hard to keep up with.
[8840.18 --> 8840.60]  I'm trying,
[8840.82 --> 8841.58]  but yeah.
[8841.80 --> 8842.06]  Yeah.
[8842.42 --> 8842.86]  Um,
[8843.22 --> 8843.52]  there was,
[8843.56 --> 8844.30]  there was one time,
[8844.36 --> 8845.24]  not even that long ago,
[8845.28 --> 8846.74]  we went out to dinner after when,
[8846.84 --> 8847.36]  yeah,
[8847.36 --> 8850.22]  ended up just continuing to talk about tech stuff the whole time.
[8850.28 --> 8850.52]  Yeah.
[8850.68 --> 8851.18]  So like,
[8851.18 --> 8853.76]  why did we even stop the show?
[8853.82 --> 8854.50]  We just needed food.
[8854.94 --> 8856.02]  How do we keep it,
[8856.02 --> 8856.66]  you know,
[8856.72 --> 8857.16]  interesting?
[8857.68 --> 8857.84]  Well,
[8857.88 --> 8858.26]  I don't know.
[8858.30 --> 8862.84]  As long as I'm interested in what he's saying and I feel like hanging around with him and vice versa,
[8863.04 --> 8864.68]  the Wancho will be interesting.
[8864.70 --> 8865.78]  It's going to be fine.
[8868.38 --> 8869.44]  That's pretty much it.
[8869.78 --> 8870.00]  Yeah.
[8871.00 --> 8871.44]  Yeah.
[8871.44 --> 8873.56]  Okay.
[8873.78 --> 8874.06]  Uh,
[8874.06 --> 8874.96]  this one's from Sarah.
[8875.38 --> 8877.82]  Need more women's underwear colors.
[8878.52 --> 8878.90]  Guys,
[8879.04 --> 8883.76]  if you were to support a new LDT channel that isn't completely tech or gaming,
[8884.16 --> 8887.24]  what topic do you think would be the easiest to get off the ground?
[8887.46 --> 8887.62]  Oh,
[8888.30 --> 8889.46]  easy.
[8890.46 --> 8890.80]  Yeah.
[8890.88 --> 8891.88]  Easiest is tough.
[8892.16 --> 8892.30]  No,
[8892.36 --> 8892.90]  because I would,
[8893.18 --> 8893.50]  Oh,
[8894.28 --> 8894.76]  okay.
[8894.92 --> 8895.58]  I'm sure.
[8895.72 --> 8896.02]  I'm,
[8896.06 --> 8896.82]  I'm ready.
[8897.06 --> 8897.46]  Automotive.
[8897.96 --> 8898.42]  Oh,
[8898.52 --> 8899.00]  okay.
[8899.12 --> 8900.06]  That's tech though.
[8900.70 --> 8900.94]  You can't,
[8901.00 --> 8901.06]  I,
[8901.06 --> 8901.84]  that's tech.
[8901.90 --> 8902.18]  Honestly,
[8902.26 --> 8902.70]  that's fair.
[8902.86 --> 8903.54]  And we'll,
[8903.70 --> 8903.96]  we'll,
[8904.14 --> 8905.38]  we'll do more later.
[8905.58 --> 8909.30]  There's no way that like between Jake and Alex and Gary,
[8909.30 --> 8911.66]  who are all like giant petrol heads.
[8911.92 --> 8912.10]  Andy.
[8912.80 --> 8913.20]  Yeah.
[8913.82 --> 8914.20]  Yeah.
[8914.20 --> 8915.10]  Nevermind Andy.
[8915.60 --> 8915.84]  Nick.
[8916.28 --> 8917.04]  There's a bunch.
[8917.22 --> 8918.70]  The more you like think about it,
[8918.72 --> 8919.40]  there's more and more and more.
[8919.52 --> 8919.76]  Yeah.
[8920.40 --> 8920.80]  No.
[8921.64 --> 8923.46]  You see these guys at like the go-kart track.
[8923.46 --> 8927.14]  There's no way we don't eventually end up with some kind of dedicated car channel.
[8927.24 --> 8928.04]  It's just a matter of time.
[8928.22 --> 8928.36]  Yeah.
[8929.32 --> 8929.66]  Okay.
[8929.82 --> 8930.08]  Yeah.
[8930.08 --> 8930.48]  That one.
[8930.48 --> 8930.72]  I mean,
[8930.72 --> 8931.52]  I was going to say,
[8931.60 --> 8932.90]  I wouldn't pick something easy.
[8932.90 --> 8935.10]  I pick something that I actually think is fun.
[8935.34 --> 8935.58]  Like I,
[8935.90 --> 8936.20]  well,
[8936.24 --> 8937.84]  the question was easiest to get off the ground.
[8937.98 --> 8938.20]  Yeah.
[8938.28 --> 8938.62]  Okay.
[8939.66 --> 8940.76]  But you can take it that way.
[8941.26 --> 8941.62]  Auto.
[8941.80 --> 8941.92]  Sure.
[8942.00 --> 8942.22]  Fine.
[8942.28 --> 8942.40]  Yeah.
[8942.48 --> 8942.90]  I accept it.
[8942.90 --> 8943.02]  No,
[8943.02 --> 8943.04]  no,
[8943.04 --> 8943.12]  no,
[8943.12 --> 8943.14]  no,
[8943.14 --> 8943.24]  no,
[8943.24 --> 8943.26]  no.
[8943.26 --> 8943.64]  Take it fun.
[8943.64 --> 8944.40]  Take it fun.
[8944.54 --> 8944.90]  Take it fun.
[8944.90 --> 8946.90]  I'd want to do something with my kids.
[8947.14 --> 8948.18]  I'd want to do like,
[8948.26 --> 8948.58]  uh,
[8948.80 --> 8949.02]  I've,
[8949.20 --> 8949.60]  you know what?
[8949.60 --> 8952.76]  I've always wanted to do a like thrifting channel.
[8953.00 --> 8953.24]  Yeah.
[8953.60 --> 8956.40]  Just like go to thrift stores and like,
[8956.40 --> 8957.40]  I can garage sales.
[8957.40 --> 8959.50]  Or even just,
[8959.74 --> 8961.10]  I found something cool or whatever.
[8961.16 --> 8961.18]  Yeah.
[8961.18 --> 8964.38]  Just find weird stuff because it's basically unboxings,
[8964.38 --> 8968.74]  except you're not limited to whatever the shiny piece du jour is.
[8969.02 --> 8972.92]  You could go look at anything from anywhere and just kind of poke at it.
[8972.92 --> 8974.86]  So you find an Atari at a garage sale.
[8974.96 --> 8975.76]  So that's the video.
[8976.20 --> 8976.96]  You go out,
[8977.02 --> 8981.50]  you're looking for something and you find it and maybe it's broken.
[8981.62 --> 8982.58]  You solder some caps,
[8982.70 --> 8984.00]  you play it and your kids are like,
[8984.06 --> 8985.22]  this is a crap game.
[8985.22 --> 8985.62]  Like,
[8985.70 --> 8985.92]  okay,
[8986.06 --> 8987.08]  fair enough.
[8987.84 --> 8989.04]  But it was a cool adventure.
[8989.26 --> 8989.48]  Yeah.
[8989.74 --> 8989.96]  Yeah.
[8990.04 --> 8991.20]  But at least you tried something,
[8991.28 --> 8991.44]  right?
[8991.76 --> 8991.98]  Yeah.
[8994.08 --> 8994.56]  Hello,
[8994.72 --> 8995.34]  LLND.
[8995.74 --> 8999.68]  Is there an ETA on when there will be big and tall sizes available?
[9000.18 --> 9002.86]  And will there be an option for big and tall?
[9002.92 --> 9006.32]  For those of us who are bigger than Linus in all three dimensions.
[9006.52 --> 9008.70]  First big and tall,
[9009.10 --> 9010.78]  then big and tall.
[9011.00 --> 9012.54]  If all of that goes well.
[9015.34 --> 9016.14]  No ETA?
[9016.96 --> 9017.38]  No.
[9017.76 --> 9018.02]  Well,
[9018.14 --> 9020.66]  big is coming and then we'll be tall.
[9021.18 --> 9023.14]  And then assuming all goes well,
[9023.48 --> 9024.46]  big and tall.
[9024.86 --> 9026.24]  I don't want to give a timeline.
[9026.56 --> 9027.14]  We're trying.
[9027.58 --> 9029.82]  It's more important that we get it right than that we get it soon.
[9030.06 --> 9030.30]  Yes.
[9030.96 --> 9031.56]  Big agree.
[9031.74 --> 9032.78]  Let's see if I can get this right.
[9033.58 --> 9034.86]  Dinah's Duke and LAN.
[9035.40 --> 9043.58]  Can you please explain why Windows File Explorer still can't show folders size on disk and instead of having to go into the properties?
[9043.78 --> 9044.64]  I don't know.
[9045.08 --> 9046.98]  It drives me crazy because I think it used to.
[9047.14 --> 9047.26]  Yeah.
[9047.44 --> 9048.38]  Back in Windows XP,
[9048.60 --> 9049.32]  didn't it used to?
[9049.58 --> 9049.96]  I swear.
[9049.96 --> 9050.82]  And like realistically,
[9051.26 --> 9051.46]  you know,
[9051.46 --> 9054.00]  the amount of crap that Windows does in the background.
[9054.84 --> 9062.72]  Why isn't just probing that and making sure that it's constantly available in an index just a thing it does then?
[9062.72 --> 9063.70]  By all means,
[9063.78 --> 9064.74]  allow me to turn it off,
[9064.82 --> 9066.36]  but it should be a feature.
[9066.46 --> 9069.64]  I used to manually run my index all the time so it would populate faster.
[9070.68 --> 9075.66]  I use a third party tool that does it in five seconds and including my entire NAS.
[9075.66 --> 9076.12]  Yeah.
[9076.12 --> 9076.38]  Like,
[9076.46 --> 9077.28]  come on,
[9077.34 --> 9077.48]  bro.
[9077.94 --> 9078.76]  It's available.
[9078.98 --> 9079.56]  It's a thing.
[9079.68 --> 9079.78]  Yeah.
[9079.78 --> 9080.42]  It's mind boggling.
[9080.50 --> 9083.28]  And the fact that it takes so long.
[9083.72 --> 9085.32]  This is metadata.
[9085.32 --> 9085.56]  Metadata.
[9086.56 --> 9089.20]  You don't have to dig into the contents of every,
[9089.20 --> 9091.80]  you're not watching every movie on this drive.
[9092.44 --> 9093.54]  It's metadata.
[9095.02 --> 9095.72]  To me,
[9095.94 --> 9102.00]  the fact that stuff like Space Sniffer isn't a first party tool at this point is just like.
[9102.98 --> 9103.42]  Yeah,
[9103.48 --> 9104.20]  it's kind of mind blowing.
[9104.42 --> 9104.48]  What?
[9104.88 --> 9105.08]  Yeah.
[9105.46 --> 9105.86]  Winderstadt,
[9105.98 --> 9109.04]  I think is a more recently updated one.
[9109.12 --> 9110.28]  I think Space Sniffer stopped getting.
[9110.28 --> 9110.36]  Oh,
[9110.36 --> 9110.74]  is it dead?
[9110.76 --> 9112.44]  We've moved on to Whiztree now.
[9112.54 --> 9112.68]  Oh,
[9112.76 --> 9113.16]  Whiztree.
[9113.16 --> 9118.36]  Which is like three seconds to do 500 terabytes.
[9118.52 --> 9118.96]  It's amazing.
[9119.20 --> 9119.36]  Wild.
[9119.58 --> 9119.80]  Wow.
[9120.74 --> 9121.18]  Okay.
[9121.42 --> 9121.82]  Moving.
[9121.96 --> 9122.24]  Oh yeah.
[9122.32 --> 9122.48]  What,
[9122.58 --> 9124.62]  what are some features that you would expect to have by now?
[9124.66 --> 9126.32]  Or is that like the major one for you?
[9126.80 --> 9127.02]  Oh,
[9127.08 --> 9128.26]  I'm sure there's stuff,
[9128.36 --> 9130.12]  but I can't think of anything off the top of my head.
[9130.26 --> 9130.44]  Okay.
[9130.76 --> 9131.20]  LLD,
[9131.50 --> 9135.20]  how can I read my boss's mind when he doesn't have time to tell me?
[9135.46 --> 9140.88]  How can I accurately evaluate context clues to deliver a report that is what he's looking for?
[9140.88 --> 9143.10]  There is no,
[9143.32 --> 9143.66]  there is.
[9143.66 --> 9144.60]  What question is this?
[9144.66 --> 9145.54]  What are you even talking about?
[9145.54 --> 9146.14]  What do you mean?
[9147.10 --> 9147.34]  What?
[9147.72 --> 9148.08]  This is,
[9148.08 --> 9149.44]  this is such a good question.
[9149.52 --> 9149.74]  Yes,
[9149.78 --> 9150.60]  this is a great question.
[9150.66 --> 9152.42]  You don't understand because you're that person.
[9152.94 --> 9153.38]  Yeah.
[9153.48 --> 9155.04]  Everyone hates you for this.
[9155.50 --> 9155.94]  What?
[9156.66 --> 9158.10]  What are you talking about?
[9158.32 --> 9159.48]  What do you mean?
[9160.02 --> 9160.52]  How am I?
[9160.56 --> 9160.66]  What?
[9160.74 --> 9161.72]  I'm that person?
[9161.72 --> 9164.12]  Have you never had this experience with somebody?
[9165.74 --> 9166.96]  I guess you're the boss.
[9167.08 --> 9167.64]  So it's like,
[9167.72 --> 9167.94]  yeah,
[9168.02 --> 9168.84]  you're the person.
[9168.92 --> 9169.12]  Okay.
[9169.22 --> 9169.38]  Well,
[9169.40 --> 9172.84]  this question is about you're the boss that this person has to deal with.
[9172.94 --> 9173.34]  Let's,
[9173.40 --> 9173.58]  uh,
[9173.58 --> 9174.18]  let's use it.
[9174.22 --> 9175.66]  Vaughn is the context here.
[9176.16 --> 9176.60]  Uh,
[9176.66 --> 9178.86]  if you could pretend to Vaughn is the boss.
[9179.94 --> 9180.90]  That's not pretending,
[9180.90 --> 9184.32]  but I don't deliver reports to her because she knows they won't be right.
[9184.32 --> 9184.76]  So,
[9184.76 --> 9186.20]  um,
[9186.32 --> 9186.54]  like,
[9186.58 --> 9186.70]  yeah,
[9186.72 --> 9186.94]  I don't,
[9187.00 --> 9187.26]  I would,
[9187.36 --> 9187.62]  I would,
[9187.66 --> 9188.62]  I would never,
[9188.88 --> 9193.20]  how can I accurately evaluate context clues to deliver a report?
[9193.62 --> 9195.30]  Is what they're looking for.
[9195.42 --> 9197.40]  So Linus will do to be just,
[9197.50 --> 9198.48]  I have to be fair here.
[9198.76 --> 9199.54]  Linus will do both.
[9200.10 --> 9203.30]  Linus will give you tons of information and a perfect.
[9203.50 --> 9204.94]  This is exactly what I want.
[9205.02 --> 9206.82]  All every question you could have answered here,
[9206.92 --> 9207.46]  go do it.
[9207.50 --> 9209.12]  And he'll also do,
[9209.28 --> 9210.48]  I want this thing.
[9210.68 --> 9213.72]  And then just walk away and you have to figure it out.
[9214.32 --> 9215.60]  he'll do both.
[9215.94 --> 9216.38]  Um,
[9216.46 --> 9217.56]  and I don't know.
[9217.58 --> 9218.90]  It just kind of comes over time.
[9218.90 --> 9219.28]  Well,
[9219.32 --> 9227.32]  my expectation is that I have a world-class team full of smart people who are hardworking and that they will probably figure it out.
[9227.40 --> 9228.56]  And if they don't figure it out,
[9228.64 --> 9232.46]  then I will tell them what they didn't figure out.
[9232.52 --> 9234.46]  And then they'll probably figure it out better next time.
[9234.80 --> 9235.06]  Like I,
[9235.06 --> 9235.26]  I,
[9235.40 --> 9236.14]  it's like,
[9236.32 --> 9237.70]  am I,
[9237.80 --> 9241.64]  am I the idiot here for not seeing the problem with this?
[9241.86 --> 9242.28]  I don't,
[9242.34 --> 9244.26]  I don't think it's a huge problem.
[9244.32 --> 9246.36]  I think to a certain degree for efficiency sake,
[9246.36 --> 9249.92]  you can't have like insanely detailed things every single time.
[9250.34 --> 9250.74]  Um,
[9250.78 --> 9252.14]  but sometimes it's really important.
[9252.14 --> 9253.08]  Like we laid out,
[9253.36 --> 9253.46]  we,
[9253.58 --> 9253.74]  okay,
[9253.82 --> 9254.54]  earlier this week,
[9254.54 --> 9257.36]  we had to have like an hour long meeting about the plan for,
[9257.36 --> 9258.00]  uh,
[9258.00 --> 9259.94]  how we're going to represent,
[9259.94 --> 9260.94]  uh,
[9260.94 --> 9266.12]  how we're going to organize the data that we present on the labs website for,
[9266.20 --> 9267.74]  for a category like GPUs.
[9267.82 --> 9270.42]  There's like an actually absurd amount of information.
[9270.42 --> 9273.00]  And there's a lot of valid ways to do it.
[9273.06 --> 9274.10]  So we have to kind of decide,
[9274.20 --> 9274.30]  okay,
[9274.30 --> 9274.44]  well,
[9274.46 --> 9275.86]  what do we think is the best way?
[9275.96 --> 9280.78]  And in order to decide that we have to have a clear idea of what the vision is for the site,
[9280.88 --> 9282.66]  past minimum viable product,
[9282.76 --> 9283.36]  past V1,
[9283.48 --> 9284.20]  past V2,
[9284.34 --> 9285.04]  and into,
[9285.18 --> 9285.34]  you know,
[9285.38 --> 9286.86]  what a V3 might look like.
[9287.30 --> 9292.26]  So that's something that I have to be involved in because I can't possibly expect anybody to know that.
[9292.64 --> 9293.40]  But if it's,
[9294.16 --> 9294.44]  hey,
[9295.04 --> 9295.84]  here's a product.
[9296.02 --> 9297.58]  We need to make a video about this.
[9299.10 --> 9303.88]  I expect them to go look at some of the documents that we have.
[9303.92 --> 9304.50]  Like we have a,
[9304.50 --> 9307.60]  we have a document called how to write good videos.
[9308.20 --> 9308.56]  Um,
[9309.08 --> 9315.16]  and most of it is stuff that I would consider to be kind of,
[9315.16 --> 9316.40]  um,
[9316.40 --> 9317.92]  common sense to a degree,
[9318.34 --> 9319.30]  but it's also,
[9319.40 --> 9321.00]  even something that's common sense,
[9321.30 --> 9324.72]  it's still helpful to have written out as,
[9324.80 --> 9325.50]  as a reminder,
[9325.62 --> 9325.82]  right?
[9326.00 --> 9327.00]  So here's how to,
[9327.10 --> 9328.50]  how to write good videos.
[9328.98 --> 9329.48]  Uh,
[9330.08 --> 9330.40]  one,
[9330.72 --> 9331.82]  the 10 laws of Linus.
[9331.94 --> 9332.18]  One,
[9332.32 --> 9333.56]  don't waste the viewer's time.
[9333.80 --> 9334.46]  What's the point?
[9334.80 --> 9337.68]  Make your point as concisely as possible while maximizing clarity.
[9337.82 --> 9339.40]  Tell me why I should care.
[9339.88 --> 9340.44]  Number two,
[9340.92 --> 9341.68]  control the scope.
[9342.06 --> 9343.94]  Make sure your point isn't too broad.
[9344.06 --> 9345.30]  Think of the game Portal.
[9345.30 --> 9347.08]  Its shortness is its greatness.
[9347.80 --> 9349.86]  Recognize when something has gone on for too long.
[9350.34 --> 9352.54]  This involves reading it to yourself at full volume,
[9352.64 --> 9353.16]  no whispering,
[9353.36 --> 9355.08]  and seeing if you run out of breath or patience.
[9355.96 --> 9356.34]  Number three,
[9356.70 --> 9357.74]  load up the learning outcomes.
[9358.08 --> 9360.14]  So lay out the learnables for each section of the video.
[9360.50 --> 9362.24]  They should come fast and furious at the beginning.
[9362.44 --> 9363.88]  Front load the video to improve retention.
[9364.60 --> 9365.20]  Number four,
[9365.20 --> 9366.70]  make it personal.
[9367.12 --> 9369.10]  Why should I care?
[9369.58 --> 9370.82]  Either apply it to the viewer,
[9370.98 --> 9372.52]  assuming the subject matter is broad enough,
[9372.66 --> 9375.54]  or to yourself or Linus or someone recognizable.
[9376.54 --> 9376.90]  Five,
[9377.32 --> 9378.54]  ask questions out loud,
[9378.62 --> 9379.36]  then answer them.
[9379.44 --> 9381.08]  This one is so important.
[9381.08 --> 9386.22]  I expect if you are given a task that you will ask questions,
[9386.22 --> 9389.78]  and then you will answer them out loud to me later.
[9389.92 --> 9392.94]  And if you don't ask any questions,
[9392.94 --> 9394.12]  you won't get any answers.
[9394.18 --> 9395.70]  And then I'm going to tell you,
[9395.76 --> 9397.00]  why are you here?
[9397.10 --> 9399.24]  Giving me a report when you haven't asked any questions,
[9399.24 --> 9400.48]  and you haven't found any answers.
[9401.12 --> 9401.52]  Right?
[9402.08 --> 9402.80]  That's not always fair.
[9403.18 --> 9405.48]  You don't always want questions to be asked because you're busy.
[9405.92 --> 9406.30]  No,
[9406.34 --> 9406.40]  no.
[9406.44 --> 9406.62]  I mean,
[9406.68 --> 9407.60]  asking them to yourself.
[9407.74 --> 9407.92]  Oh,
[9407.98 --> 9408.14]  okay.
[9408.14 --> 9409.84]  Ask questions out loud,
[9409.94 --> 9411.02]  then answer them.
[9411.06 --> 9412.70]  It's like for videos.
[9412.90 --> 9415.22]  It's just such an effective storytelling technique.
[9415.36 --> 9415.38]  Yeah,
[9415.38 --> 9415.78]  for sure.
[9415.88 --> 9416.62]  But Linus,
[9417.22 --> 9424.98]  why on earth would they have it shaped like this when a square would be so much more efficient to,
[9425.02 --> 9425.28]  you know,
[9425.34 --> 9427.60]  pack in next to each other and maximize volume?
[9427.86 --> 9429.06]  I'm so glad you asked.
[9429.14 --> 9430.28]  The shape of a cylinder is,
[9430.48 --> 9430.88]  you know,
[9430.92 --> 9431.16]  whatever,
[9431.30 --> 9431.46]  right?
[9433.32 --> 9434.76]  Maximizes the materials,
[9435.02 --> 9435.20]  you know,
[9435.20 --> 9435.44]  whatever.
[9437.08 --> 9437.84]  Number six,
[9437.84 --> 9438.82]  provide context.
[9439.24 --> 9444.60]  It's not always obvious how good a screen is or amazing a microprocessor feature is.
[9444.94 --> 9446.82]  Is it the price that makes it amazing?
[9447.30 --> 9448.44]  Why should I care?
[9448.74 --> 9449.84]  That one comes up a lot.
[9450.62 --> 9450.98]  Number seven,
[9451.08 --> 9452.14]  remember who you're talking to.
[9452.74 --> 9456.02]  Every video is a potential gateway drug that pulls the viewer deeply into the hobby,
[9456.42 --> 9459.48]  but some videos have a more technical level of discourse than others.
[9459.58 --> 9462.42]  So don't talk down to the audience about a highly technical subject,
[9462.42 --> 9464.82]  but don't always assume pre-existing knowledge.
[9465.94 --> 9466.56]  Number eight,
[9466.56 --> 9467.62]  plan for the payoff.
[9468.34 --> 9473.32]  Know what the payoff will need to be so that the video culminates in something satisfying.
[9473.56 --> 9476.10]  Lord of the Rings would have sucked if we never got to see Mount Doom.
[9476.58 --> 9477.14]  Don't forget,
[9477.26 --> 9479.28]  a negative outcome is still an outcome.
[9479.62 --> 9480.48]  It's part of the journey,
[9480.68 --> 9482.58]  and a journey can be an outcome.
[9483.04 --> 9484.20]  You just need to plan for it.
[9484.66 --> 9485.22]  Number nine,
[9485.74 --> 9487.32]  tell and show us how to feel.
[9487.32 --> 9488.86]  And this is where,
[9489.10 --> 9491.06]  this is from our internal documentation.
[9491.44 --> 9492.64]  If you break it down,
[9492.82 --> 9495.04]  90% of YouTube is reaction videos.
[9495.90 --> 9496.84]  Reacting to news,
[9497.12 --> 9497.58]  or life,
[9497.78 --> 9498.24]  or tech.
[9498.80 --> 9500.56]  Don't tell me what's happening
[9500.56 --> 9503.58]  if you can show me how to feel what's happening.
[9503.58 --> 9504.86]  So instead of,
[9505.04 --> 9506.38]  and this was an example from a video,
[9506.70 --> 9508.42]  where someone scripted it,
[9508.64 --> 9509.44]  and brought it to me,
[9509.48 --> 9509.84]  and I said,
[9509.92 --> 9510.08]  yeah,
[9510.14 --> 9510.66]  it's okay,
[9510.82 --> 9511.94]  but here's how it needs to be.
[9512.52 --> 9512.88]  Yeah,
[9512.96 --> 9514.04]  look at this Pixel 6,
[9514.30 --> 9515.26]  5G in the corner,
[9515.48 --> 9516.92]  but when I type these digits,
[9517.00 --> 9518.02]  and check phone information,
[9518.18 --> 9519.14]  it says I'm on LTE.
[9519.32 --> 9519.86]  What the heck?
[9520.52 --> 9521.90]  Why would I say all that
[9521.90 --> 9522.96]  when I can just say,
[9523.60 --> 9525.26]  but when I type this,
[9525.72 --> 9526.16]  LTE?
[9526.94 --> 9527.70]  What the heck?
[9528.10 --> 9529.86]  I don't have to say check phone information.
[9530.04 --> 9530.78]  It says I'm on LTE.
[9530.92 --> 9531.96]  I have to show emotion.
[9532.10 --> 9533.06]  I have to show you how to feel.
[9534.34 --> 9534.96]  Number 10,
[9535.24 --> 9535.64]  have fun.
[9536.52 --> 9537.26]  Fun is infectious,
[9537.46 --> 9538.16]  and so is misery.
[9538.30 --> 9539.50]  If you have a bad time making a video,
[9539.64 --> 9540.54]  find a way to make it fun,
[9540.60 --> 9541.38]  or you will fail,
[9541.58 --> 9542.82]  which will create more misery,
[9543.02 --> 9544.14]  which will create more failure.
[9544.68 --> 9545.46]  I think you complete.
[9545.76 --> 9547.38]  It was very cool to go over,
[9547.72 --> 9549.44]  because the video Bible is awesome.
[9549.44 --> 9550.04]  All that kind of stuff.
[9550.26 --> 9552.10]  I think you completely dodged the actual,
[9552.66 --> 9553.64]  maybe unintentionally,
[9553.74 --> 9554.60]  but the actual question
[9554.60 --> 9555.56]  that the person had, though,
[9555.78 --> 9556.98]  because you're giving an example
[9556.98 --> 9559.52]  of where you did lay out what you want,
[9559.82 --> 9560.44]  and they're asking,
[9560.58 --> 9561.96]  how do I deal with when they don't?
[9563.18 --> 9564.78]  Well, what do I want that's not clear?
[9565.72 --> 9567.20]  You often ask for things
[9567.20 --> 9568.04]  that aren't that clear.
[9568.14 --> 9568.66]  No, I mean, no.
[9569.36 --> 9569.98]  Tell me.
[9570.44 --> 9571.58]  What can I do better?
[9571.78 --> 9572.24]  You'll be like,
[9572.28 --> 9573.52]  I want this thing.
[9573.66 --> 9574.54]  I don't care.
[9574.64 --> 9575.78]  I don't actually mind this.
[9575.94 --> 9576.40]  Oh, I see.
[9576.40 --> 9577.10]  Okay, Dan.
[9577.10 --> 9581.10]  Oh, I have learned that you go,
[9581.18 --> 9583.08]  I would like nebulous thing,
[9583.28 --> 9586.40]  and I just do the nebulous thing.
[9587.34 --> 9587.70]  Okay.
[9587.88 --> 9588.90]  And then it's normally fine.
[9588.90 --> 9589.74]  The answer that I would give
[9589.74 --> 9591.52]  is try to look into the things
[9591.52 --> 9593.18]  that that person has liked
[9593.18 --> 9594.76]  or valued in the past,
[9595.00 --> 9596.18]  and try to take the tenets
[9596.18 --> 9597.08]  that you can take from that,
[9597.14 --> 9598.52]  and apply it to what you're currently working on,
[9598.60 --> 9599.68]  and do the best job you can.
[9599.82 --> 9601.10]  It's a much more eloquent way
[9601.74 --> 9602.96]  to put what I tried to say.
[9602.96 --> 9606.02]  I mean, it's all people relationships, right?
[9606.16 --> 9606.28]  Yeah.
[9606.44 --> 9609.58]  Like, yeah, boss, employee, friend,
[9610.02 --> 9613.02]  or, you know, SO, or landlord, or whatever.
[9613.08 --> 9615.06]  Your whole life is full of interactions with people,
[9615.14 --> 9615.88]  but they're just people.
[9616.20 --> 9617.18]  Like, if you look...
[9617.18 --> 9617.40]  Sorry.
[9618.28 --> 9619.06]  Oh, I was just going to say,
[9619.26 --> 9621.36]  so I think an example where I did give
[9621.36 --> 9622.94]  just an end point
[9622.94 --> 9624.64]  and didn't provide a lot of guidance
[9624.64 --> 9625.62]  was Whale Land.
[9626.40 --> 9626.76]  Yeah.
[9627.08 --> 9628.80]  I was like, let's have a land.
[9628.84 --> 9629.54]  It's going to be sick.
[9630.54 --> 9631.54]  We want people to interact,
[9631.54 --> 9632.98]  and that's pretty much all we, like, said.
[9633.14 --> 9633.28]  Yeah.
[9633.62 --> 9635.60]  What I try and drill down to is, like,
[9636.22 --> 9638.20]  what do I think the end point
[9638.20 --> 9640.56]  of this thing that Linus wants is,
[9640.62 --> 9642.94]  or why is he asking me to do this?
[9644.30 --> 9646.04]  Why is it important to him?
[9646.50 --> 9647.48]  And then you can kind of base
[9647.48 --> 9649.14]  your entire task around that, right?
[9649.14 --> 9650.08]  Well, then if you don't agree,
[9650.24 --> 9651.62]  then you need to get on the same page
[9651.62 --> 9652.30]  about the importance.
[9652.30 --> 9653.80]  If you don't think it's important,
[9653.80 --> 9655.54]  or you think something else is important.
[9655.86 --> 9659.04]  If Linus has not correctly articulated
[9659.04 --> 9660.58]  why it's important to him,
[9660.58 --> 9662.20]  that's when I would ask follow-up questions.
[9662.80 --> 9664.04]  Like, one example that I would give
[9664.04 --> 9665.96]  is look at creator warehouse products.
[9666.64 --> 9666.90]  Sure.
[9667.04 --> 9668.98]  If you look at a huge range of creator,
[9669.04 --> 9669.64]  if someone's like,
[9669.70 --> 9670.24]  if you're like,
[9670.40 --> 9671.82]  hey, I want a, meh, whatever.
[9672.40 --> 9673.70]  Yeah, I want a lighter
[9673.70 --> 9675.36]  where it's the shape of a butt
[9675.36 --> 9676.36]  and it looks like the flame
[9676.36 --> 9677.24]  is coming out of the butt.
[9677.32 --> 9678.22]  And if you're wondering, like,
[9678.28 --> 9680.14]  how good it should be,
[9680.32 --> 9681.28]  how effective it should be,
[9681.34 --> 9682.30]  what materials you should use,
[9682.32 --> 9682.86]  all that kind of stuff,
[9683.10 --> 9684.62]  look into the other products in the store,
[9684.62 --> 9686.68]  and you can probably figure out
[9686.68 --> 9689.24]  a, like, quality level design language
[9689.24 --> 9690.64]  for making this thing.
[9690.74 --> 9690.96]  Yeah.
[9691.20 --> 9692.52]  Butt lighter heirloom piece.
[9693.36 --> 9693.76]  Yes.
[9694.72 --> 9696.86]  We will do my cat teaser at some point.
[9697.48 --> 9698.72]  It's going to be like $60.
[9698.72 --> 9700.34]  If you were trying to make decisions
[9700.34 --> 9703.30]  on materials for the cat teaser thing,
[9703.42 --> 9705.00]  you could probably figure out the direction
[9705.00 --> 9706.44]  to go in by looking at the other products
[9706.44 --> 9706.84]  on the store.
[9706.84 --> 9710.06]  Like, there's, there's often things around
[9710.06 --> 9711.84]  that can, that can guide decisions.
[9713.52 --> 9714.78]  Someone in Floflame Chat,
[9714.84 --> 9716.22]  I'd consider buying that later.
[9717.64 --> 9718.88]  Don't encourage him.
[9720.28 --> 9721.04]  I'd have to.
[9721.70 --> 9722.96]  Uh, hi, LL, oh yeah.
[9723.12 --> 9724.44]  Uh, yeah, okay.
[9724.58 --> 9725.14]  Let's move on.
[9725.56 --> 9726.16]  Hi, LLD.
[9726.40 --> 9727.62]  With the scrutiny of,
[9727.84 --> 9729.26]  I guess, censored content,
[9729.58 --> 9732.00]  should people on commissions also,
[9732.24 --> 9733.32]  no, sponsored content.
[9733.46 --> 9734.28]  Sorry, it was cut off there.
[9734.76 --> 9735.80]  Uh, should people on,
[9735.80 --> 9737.76]  let's try this again.
[9738.12 --> 9738.88]  Hi, LLD.
[9739.04 --> 9741.12]  With the scrutiny on sponsored content,
[9741.50 --> 9742.84]  should people on commissions
[9742.84 --> 9744.54]  also be required to disclose?
[9745.04 --> 9746.98]  Uh, mortgage brokers, travel agents
[9746.98 --> 9748.30]  often will have incentives
[9748.30 --> 9750.52]  from companies to promote their stuff.
[9751.20 --> 9752.12]  I absolutely think so.
[9752.34 --> 9752.46]  Yeah.
[9752.56 --> 9752.70]  Yeah.
[9752.74 --> 9754.36]  Any kind of, um,
[9754.74 --> 9755.92]  well, I mean, we talked about this
[9755.92 --> 9756.84]  when we were talking about
[9756.84 --> 9758.80]  marketing the backpack recently.
[9759.42 --> 9760.54]  Um, you know,
[9760.60 --> 9762.72]  anytime there's a financial incentive
[9762.72 --> 9763.56]  to do anything,
[9763.56 --> 9765.18]  there is supposed to be,
[9765.18 --> 9766.24]  uh, disclosure.
[9766.50 --> 9767.34]  It's just a matter of
[9767.34 --> 9768.88]  how well regulated it is
[9768.88 --> 9770.24]  and how, uh,
[9770.32 --> 9772.20]  how canceled someone will get
[9772.20 --> 9773.52]  if it turns out
[9773.52 --> 9774.32]  that they were not
[9774.32 --> 9775.50]  properly disclosing things,
[9775.54 --> 9776.22]  which these days
[9776.22 --> 9778.18]  seems to be not very canceled
[9778.18 --> 9779.78]  because there's plenty of creators
[9779.78 --> 9781.00]  that participated in
[9781.00 --> 9782.68]  fairly egregious things
[9782.68 --> 9783.72]  like crypto rug pulls
[9783.72 --> 9784.46]  or whatever else
[9784.46 --> 9785.62]  that seem to be
[9785.62 --> 9787.34]  not very canceled at all somehow.
[9787.46 --> 9787.80]  I don't,
[9787.94 --> 9789.08]  I can't fathom it personally,
[9789.08 --> 9790.10]  but hey, there you are.
[9790.10 --> 9790.58]  Yeah.
[9790.58 --> 9793.96]  Love the show.
[9794.18 --> 9794.88]  Having grown to
[9794.88 --> 9796.20]  a hundred plus employees,
[9796.36 --> 9797.76]  how do you expect to balance
[9797.76 --> 9799.12]  being a business
[9799.12 --> 9801.20]  with being a relatable creator?
[9802.90 --> 9804.26]  Am I relatable anymore?
[9805.00 --> 9806.38]  I mean, there's certain things
[9806.38 --> 9807.84]  that we do intentionally.
[9808.02 --> 9808.90]  Like, like, here's something.
[9809.02 --> 9810.86]  We've, we've struggled a lot with,
[9810.94 --> 9811.84]  uh, hey, this is also
[9811.84 --> 9813.66]  from the How to Write Good Videos document.
[9813.88 --> 9815.68]  It's not one of the 10 laws of Linus,
[9815.72 --> 9816.68]  but it's something.
[9818.84 --> 9819.26]  Um...
[9820.58 --> 9822.36]  Where is it?
[9823.82 --> 9824.34]  Uh...
[9824.34 --> 9824.82]  Oh.
[9825.86 --> 9826.58]  I don't know.
[9826.72 --> 9827.88]  It seems to have been moved,
[9828.00 --> 9829.50]  but basically I,
[9829.50 --> 9831.20]  I laid out a guideline
[9831.20 --> 9832.94]  for the writing team
[9832.94 --> 9833.72]  that basically says,
[9833.80 --> 9834.68]  look, we need to stop talking
[9834.68 --> 9835.22]  about money
[9835.22 --> 9837.10]  in subjective terms.
[9837.68 --> 9839.04]  Um, and it was,
[9839.30 --> 9840.10]  have I talked about this
[9840.10 --> 9840.80]  on WAN Show before?
[9840.94 --> 9841.06]  Yeah.
[9841.14 --> 9841.56]  Oh, okay.
[9841.62 --> 9842.12]  Then never mind.
[9842.60 --> 9844.04]  Um, yeah, I, I,
[9844.04 --> 9844.94]  I don't, I don't know.
[9844.98 --> 9846.18]  It's tough because some days
[9846.18 --> 9848.04]  I feel completely out of touch.
[9848.22 --> 9849.50]  Like I said, with the,
[9849.78 --> 9850.30]  you know, just,
[9850.58 --> 9851.88]  sure, make it so
[9851.88 --> 9854.24]  for the $3,000 concrete pad
[9854.24 --> 9855.12]  for our, you know,
[9855.18 --> 9857.10]  six-figure RF chamber.
[9857.26 --> 9857.74]  Right?
[9857.76 --> 9858.32]  Like, obviously,
[9858.32 --> 9861.92]  that's not a real person situation
[9861.92 --> 9863.48]  that they find themselves in.
[9863.58 --> 9864.88]  But then other times,
[9865.14 --> 9866.06]  you know,
[9866.10 --> 9868.04]  I have exactly the same challenges
[9868.04 --> 9869.16]  that you guys do.
[9869.24 --> 9870.32]  Like, how do I manage,
[9870.44 --> 9871.76]  uh, the time my kids
[9871.76 --> 9873.20]  are spending on their devices?
[9873.46 --> 9875.10]  And, uh, you know,
[9875.10 --> 9876.52]  how do I make sure that,
[9876.52 --> 9878.88]  um, you know,
[9878.88 --> 9879.48]  how do I,
[9879.54 --> 9880.58]  how do I deal with a,
[9880.64 --> 9881.90]  you know, crash
[9881.90 --> 9883.04]  when my,
[9883.32 --> 9884.26]  when I launch this game
[9884.26 --> 9884.88]  on my computer,
[9884.88 --> 9885.12]  right?
[9885.12 --> 9887.48]  Like, no amount of money
[9887.48 --> 9888.26]  makes you immune
[9888.26 --> 9889.08]  to any of that.
[9889.18 --> 9890.92]  No amount of people
[9890.92 --> 9891.82]  who work for you
[9891.82 --> 9893.18]  means that you don't have to,
[9893.26 --> 9894.14]  you don't freak out
[9894.14 --> 9896.24]  when your server,
[9896.52 --> 9897.52]  you know, reboots
[9897.52 --> 9898.34]  and you,
[9898.68 --> 9899.16]  all of a sudden
[9899.16 --> 9899.94]  your array
[9899.94 --> 9901.30]  is not showing up properly.
[9901.30 --> 9901.84]  It's like, yeah,
[9901.84 --> 9902.66]  just because you have a backup
[9902.66 --> 9903.54]  doesn't mean that it didn't
[9903.54 --> 9904.44]  just create a ton of work
[9904.44 --> 9904.70]  for you.
[9904.74 --> 9905.42]  Like, I don't know.
[9905.48 --> 9905.74]  There's,
[9907.18 --> 9910.20]  I think the most important thing
[9910.20 --> 9913.14]  is to not get too far removed
[9913.14 --> 9914.96]  from the actual tech.
[9915.74 --> 9917.80]  Um, and that's tough.
[9917.86 --> 9918.92]  The more people that are here,
[9919.62 --> 9920.40]  the more involved
[9920.40 --> 9921.32]  I am in administration.
[9921.32 --> 9922.58]  But I think that
[9922.58 --> 9924.14]  I might have some ideas
[9924.14 --> 9925.06]  for how to fix that
[9925.06 --> 9926.00]  and hopefully I'll be able
[9926.00 --> 9927.38]  to share them with you guys
[9927.38 --> 9928.60]  in the coming weeks.
[9930.56 --> 9931.46]  Howdy lads.
[9931.70 --> 9933.44]  Going through a hard breakup
[9933.44 --> 9934.04]  right now.
[9934.44 --> 9935.50]  Your large library
[9935.50 --> 9936.48]  of long streams
[9936.48 --> 9937.58]  are a great distraction.
[9938.44 --> 9939.44]  If you could change
[9939.44 --> 9940.04]  one thing
[9940.04 --> 9941.26]  in the history of technology,
[9941.48 --> 9942.82]  what would it be and why?
[9943.20 --> 9944.96]  More stereoscopic 3D.
[9949.72 --> 9950.34]  I don't know.
[9950.38 --> 9950.78]  It's cool.
[9951.56 --> 9952.50]  It's kind of still here.
[9952.62 --> 9953.20]  You know, it's just,
[9953.32 --> 9954.74]  it kind of comes and goes, right?
[9954.80 --> 9955.80]  You've got your VR now.
[9956.20 --> 9956.80]  Is it fair to talk
[9956.80 --> 9957.70]  about software features
[9957.70 --> 9958.38]  when he's asking
[9958.38 --> 9959.04]  about technology?
[9959.28 --> 9959.44]  Sure.
[9960.16 --> 9962.12]  Uh, microtransactions, no.
[9964.44 --> 9965.94]  Delete microtransactions.
[9966.04 --> 9966.72]  That's a pretty good answer.
[9966.86 --> 9967.44]  I like that.
[9967.54 --> 9967.82]  Me too.
[9967.82 --> 9968.54]  That's better than mine.
[9968.80 --> 9970.00]  That's a very noble answer.
[9970.06 --> 9970.72]  I was just memeing.
[9972.64 --> 9973.62]  Okay, last one
[9973.62 --> 9974.62]  of my curated today.
[9975.62 --> 9977.06]  Oh, now it's two.
[9977.06 --> 9979.50]  I still run my 20-year-old
[9979.50 --> 9981.30]  Logitech 5.1 speakers.
[9981.66 --> 9982.70]  It's better than being
[9982.70 --> 9983.62]  tethered to a headset
[9983.62 --> 9985.64]  and a lot of game support 5.1,
[9985.98 --> 9986.68]  letting me know
[9986.68 --> 9988.10]  when enemies are behind me.
[9988.36 --> 9989.36]  Why did Linus
[9989.36 --> 9990.20]  stop using these?
[9990.20 --> 9993.58]  Oh, I moved in with my in-laws
[9993.58 --> 9997.10]  and they had tenants
[9997.10 --> 9998.98]  and so using speakers
[9998.98 --> 10000.86]  is something I didn't,
[10000.92 --> 10002.00]  I didn't really think about this
[10002.00 --> 10002.70]  when I lived in the middle
[10002.70 --> 10003.50]  of the boondocks
[10003.50 --> 10005.36]  in my parents' house.
[10006.16 --> 10008.34]  Using speakers is a privilege,
[10008.38 --> 10009.04]  not a right.
[10010.64 --> 10012.86]  And then I went from living,
[10012.86 --> 10013.18]  That's very true.
[10013.30 --> 10014.02]  Yeah, I went from living
[10014.02 --> 10014.88]  with the in-laws
[10014.88 --> 10016.34]  to having children
[10016.34 --> 10018.14]  who sleep.
[10018.80 --> 10019.20]  Nowadays,
[10019.50 --> 10020.38]  there's no real reason
[10020.38 --> 10021.32]  not to use speakers
[10021.32 --> 10022.16]  other than
[10022.16 --> 10023.70]  single-player gaming
[10023.70 --> 10024.46]  is not really much
[10024.46 --> 10025.52]  of a thing for me anymore
[10025.52 --> 10026.64]  and when you're
[10026.64 --> 10027.52]  a multiplayer gamer,
[10028.14 --> 10029.16]  don't be that guy.
[10030.14 --> 10030.96]  Don't be the guy
[10030.96 --> 10031.62]  with speakers.
[10032.58 --> 10032.98]  Right?
[10033.86 --> 10035.34]  So, when the heck
[10035.34 --> 10035.84]  am I ever going
[10035.84 --> 10036.50]  to use speakers?
[10037.06 --> 10037.94]  Yeah, it ends up
[10037.94 --> 10038.54]  working for me
[10038.54 --> 10039.40]  that if I'm going
[10039.40 --> 10040.26]  to use speakers,
[10041.04 --> 10041.84]  I could probably
[10041.84 --> 10042.94]  just play on the TV anyways.
[10043.58 --> 10044.40]  So then it's like
[10044.40 --> 10045.02]  kind of a combination
[10045.02 --> 10045.96]  experience, you know?
[10045.96 --> 10048.96]  Speaking of video games,
[10049.30 --> 10049.84]  Hello Linus,
[10049.90 --> 10050.64]  I'm happy to hear
[10050.64 --> 10052.62]  you finished Horizon Zero Dawn.
[10053.04 --> 10054.20]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[10054.34 --> 10054.70]  I did.
[10055.20 --> 10056.14]  Do you plan on playing
[10056.14 --> 10057.54]  Horizon Forbidden West
[10057.54 --> 10058.24]  anytime soon
[10058.24 --> 10059.22]  or will you be waiting
[10059.22 --> 10060.80]  for a PC desk launch?
[10061.58 --> 10062.30]  Deck launch.
[10063.14 --> 10064.78]  Why would I play it
[10064.78 --> 10065.44]  on a PlayStation
[10065.44 --> 10068.48]  when I can play it later
[10068.48 --> 10069.40]  on a PC?
[10069.52 --> 10069.94]  There is,
[10070.34 --> 10070.72]  you know what,
[10070.78 --> 10071.98]  this is like a funny thing
[10071.98 --> 10072.54]  that I feel like
[10072.54 --> 10073.40]  is really different
[10073.40 --> 10074.50]  between me
[10074.50 --> 10075.12]  and other people.
[10076.38 --> 10077.82]  I don't need
[10077.82 --> 10078.64]  to do it now.
[10079.10 --> 10080.00]  I don't need
[10080.00 --> 10081.00]  to watch the movie now.
[10081.24 --> 10082.06]  I don't need
[10082.06 --> 10083.00]  to play that game now.
[10083.54 --> 10085.18]  My queue of games
[10085.18 --> 10085.94]  that I'm supposed
[10085.94 --> 10086.44]  to play
[10086.44 --> 10088.64]  is so flippin' deep
[10088.64 --> 10089.90]  that if I started
[10089.90 --> 10091.56]  and it was my full-time job
[10091.56 --> 10092.04]  to do nothing
[10092.04 --> 10092.88]  but play games
[10092.88 --> 10094.02]  that I want to play
[10094.02 --> 10095.24]  and my list of things
[10095.24 --> 10095.68]  to play
[10095.68 --> 10096.66]  or even in my Steam
[10096.66 --> 10097.44]  library already,
[10097.94 --> 10099.26]  it would be
[10099.26 --> 10100.60]  probably a couple
[10100.60 --> 10101.14]  of years
[10101.14 --> 10101.92]  before I would get
[10101.92 --> 10102.78]  to anything current.
[10102.78 --> 10104.78]  So if something new
[10104.78 --> 10105.56]  comes out,
[10106.22 --> 10107.12]  what's the hurry?
[10112.10 --> 10112.84]  That's fair.
[10112.96 --> 10113.96]  And there's situations
[10113.96 --> 10114.94]  where that's totally
[10114.94 --> 10116.34]  not valid, right?
[10116.98 --> 10118.38]  Being part of
[10118.38 --> 10119.88]  the initial launch
[10119.88 --> 10121.38]  of a new multiplayer game
[10121.38 --> 10122.02]  in particular
[10122.02 --> 10123.56]  and part of the community
[10123.56 --> 10124.10]  and, you know,
[10124.16 --> 10124.84]  figuring out
[10124.84 --> 10126.50]  all the little tricks
[10126.50 --> 10127.00]  and stuff
[10127.00 --> 10128.12]  alongside everyone else,
[10128.90 --> 10130.50]  that's huge.
[10130.60 --> 10131.46]  That's so fun.
[10131.46 --> 10132.86]  That's so engaging, right?
[10134.64 --> 10136.78]  But I don't have...
[10136.78 --> 10137.58]  It's tough to play
[10137.58 --> 10138.50]  competitive games
[10138.50 --> 10139.20]  for me these days.
[10139.26 --> 10140.20]  I'm just not that good.
[10140.72 --> 10141.06]  And dude,
[10141.14 --> 10142.94]  people are so sweaty
[10142.94 --> 10143.64]  these days.
[10144.18 --> 10144.62]  Like,
[10145.22 --> 10145.86]  whoa!
[10146.10 --> 10146.94]  It feels like,
[10147.30 --> 10147.60]  man,
[10147.70 --> 10148.58]  like over half
[10148.58 --> 10149.12]  the players
[10149.12 --> 10149.70]  are playing
[10149.70 --> 10151.02]  as if this could become
[10151.02 --> 10152.38]  their full-time job.
[10152.74 --> 10153.36]  Like, it's...
[10153.36 --> 10154.58]  It's work.
[10154.58 --> 10155.38]  Look how many people
[10155.38 --> 10156.76]  aspire to be streamers,
[10156.80 --> 10156.98]  right?
[10157.04 --> 10157.44]  That's true.
[10157.62 --> 10157.86]  Yeah.
[10158.54 --> 10159.22]  I don't.
[10159.36 --> 10160.02]  It looks rough.
[10160.70 --> 10162.74]  I do not envy streamers.
[10163.30 --> 10163.46]  Yeah,
[10163.54 --> 10164.94]  it's kind of weird.
[10165.08 --> 10165.24]  Like,
[10165.26 --> 10165.80]  I feel like
[10165.80 --> 10166.52]  the amount of people
[10166.52 --> 10167.94]  that play multiplayer games
[10167.94 --> 10168.50]  casually
[10168.50 --> 10170.68]  when we were growing up
[10170.68 --> 10171.60]  used to be the majority
[10171.60 --> 10172.78]  and is absolutely
[10172.78 --> 10173.64]  the minority
[10173.64 --> 10174.26]  these days.
[10174.58 --> 10174.74]  Like,
[10174.76 --> 10175.58]  it's...
[10175.58 --> 10177.02]  It's kind of wild.
[10178.38 --> 10178.74]  Hot take,
[10178.80 --> 10179.62]  they've always been sweaty.
[10179.74 --> 10180.44]  I don't agree.
[10180.66 --> 10180.90]  Like,
[10180.98 --> 10181.28]  at all,
[10181.36 --> 10181.72]  actually.
[10182.76 --> 10182.96]  Like,
[10183.00 --> 10183.30]  if you...
[10183.30 --> 10184.44]  I've brought up this analogy
[10184.44 --> 10185.36]  a bunch in the past,
[10185.42 --> 10185.60]  actually,
[10185.62 --> 10186.22]  and I think this
[10186.22 --> 10187.82]  directly counters that point.
[10188.08 --> 10188.88]  Back in the day,
[10189.12 --> 10190.72]  playing multiplayer RPG games,
[10190.88 --> 10192.58]  if you got a fancy
[10192.58 --> 10193.36]  piece of armor
[10193.36 --> 10194.04]  or weapon,
[10194.22 --> 10195.42]  but it was ugly,
[10196.12 --> 10196.98]  you wouldn't wear it.
[10197.86 --> 10199.40]  If it was a stat upgrade,
[10199.70 --> 10200.22]  but you're like,
[10200.30 --> 10200.50]  ah,
[10200.50 --> 10201.22]  it looks gross,
[10201.66 --> 10202.62]  people wouldn't put it on.
[10202.72 --> 10203.14]  And this...
[10203.14 --> 10204.06]  I'm not making this up.
[10204.12 --> 10205.54]  A lot of Zoomer boys
[10205.54 --> 10206.66]  don't believe me,
[10206.90 --> 10208.24]  but it's actually a thing.
[10208.60 --> 10209.44]  People would be like,
[10209.66 --> 10209.78]  yeah,
[10209.82 --> 10210.42]  that's an upgrade,
[10210.56 --> 10210.92]  but like,
[10211.08 --> 10212.40]  I'm wearing entirely
[10212.40 --> 10214.26]  green armor
[10214.26 --> 10215.36]  and that's
[10215.36 --> 10216.54]  orange
[10216.54 --> 10217.32]  or something.
[10217.58 --> 10218.72]  And it just doesn't fit.
[10218.78 --> 10219.36]  It doesn't look good.
[10219.42 --> 10220.72]  So I'll keep it in my bags.
[10220.82 --> 10221.54]  Maybe I'll find stuff
[10221.54 --> 10222.44]  that works with it later.
[10224.16 --> 10224.96]  And now,
[10225.08 --> 10225.48]  it's like,
[10225.54 --> 10227.06]  you'll look like a
[10227.06 --> 10229.56]  total random
[10229.56 --> 10230.72]  wardrobe person
[10230.72 --> 10231.90]  just as long
[10231.90 --> 10232.82]  as these things
[10232.82 --> 10234.04]  give better stats.
[10234.14 --> 10235.30]  You can compete harder.
[10235.96 --> 10236.20]  Just,
[10236.62 --> 10236.96]  bah!
[10237.26 --> 10238.22]  It's a very,
[10238.36 --> 10239.30]  very different mentality.
[10239.44 --> 10242.20]  Finally,
[10242.34 --> 10243.22]  making my first
[10243.22 --> 10244.86]  LTT store.com purchase.
[10245.28 --> 10246.66]  You've occasionally
[10246.66 --> 10247.74]  mentioned applications
[10247.74 --> 10248.52]  and tools
[10248.52 --> 10248.96]  you use
[10248.96 --> 10249.72]  to make your work
[10249.72 --> 10250.12]  easier.
[10250.60 --> 10251.58]  Do you use
[10251.58 --> 10252.40]  any particular
[10252.40 --> 10253.52]  human capital
[10253.52 --> 10254.46]  management software
[10254.46 --> 10255.18]  at LMG?
[10255.54 --> 10255.80]  Thanks,
[10255.86 --> 10256.02]  y'all.
[10256.02 --> 10260.60]  Was that for me?
[10260.74 --> 10260.94]  Yeah.
[10261.06 --> 10261.60]  I was reading.
[10261.76 --> 10262.00]  Sorry.
[10263.10 --> 10263.92]  It could be both
[10263.92 --> 10264.36]  of you.
[10264.48 --> 10264.78]  I mean,
[10264.94 --> 10265.36]  LMG.
[10265.48 --> 10266.10]  I didn't hear it.
[10266.56 --> 10267.36]  HCM software?
[10268.44 --> 10268.84]  HCM?
[10268.84 --> 10269.38]  I think it's like
[10269.38 --> 10270.74]  HR software.
[10273.60 --> 10274.96]  Human capital management.
[10275.24 --> 10276.24]  That sounds horrifying.
[10276.44 --> 10277.18]  I don't like that term.
[10277.36 --> 10278.22]  It sure does.
[10279.06 --> 10280.14]  If the question was,
[10280.22 --> 10281.14]  are we looking into it?
[10281.22 --> 10281.96]  I would say no.
[10282.16 --> 10282.78]  Do we use any?
[10282.78 --> 10283.26]  I didn't know what it was.
[10283.38 --> 10283.54]  No.
[10285.58 --> 10286.54]  Manage their employees
[10286.54 --> 10287.82]  from hire to retire.
[10288.26 --> 10288.48]  No,
[10288.58 --> 10289.98]  but I wouldn't be surprised
[10289.98 --> 10290.58]  if,
[10291.14 --> 10291.60]  like,
[10291.70 --> 10292.42]  managing employees
[10292.42 --> 10293.32]  is absolutely a thing
[10293.32 --> 10294.36]  that you need to do.
[10294.62 --> 10294.74]  And,
[10294.88 --> 10294.94]  like,
[10295.04 --> 10295.62]  onboarding
[10295.62 --> 10296.42]  and offboarding
[10296.42 --> 10297.64]  can be very complicated,
[10297.78 --> 10298.44]  especially without
[10298.44 --> 10299.56]  any form of automation
[10299.56 --> 10300.86]  or system to do so.
[10301.16 --> 10302.02]  We didn't have
[10302.02 --> 10303.20]  any HR people
[10303.20 --> 10304.20]  until very recently,
[10304.64 --> 10305.70]  so maybe they'll
[10305.70 --> 10306.52]  approach me
[10306.52 --> 10307.28]  about getting something
[10307.28 --> 10307.74]  like this
[10307.74 --> 10308.24]  at some point
[10308.24 --> 10308.70]  in the future.
[10308.80 --> 10309.68]  I wouldn't be too surprised.
[10309.96 --> 10310.64]  I know they've been
[10310.64 --> 10311.30]  talking about
[10311.30 --> 10312.98]  certain implementations
[10312.98 --> 10314.86]  of different,
[10314.94 --> 10315.12]  like,
[10315.18 --> 10315.82]  online tools
[10315.82 --> 10316.72]  that they're already using.
[10317.80 --> 10318.28]  So,
[10318.90 --> 10319.36]  I don't know.
[10320.20 --> 10320.52]  Maybe.
[10321.20 --> 10321.88]  We are growing.
[10322.16 --> 10322.70]  Things happening.
[10323.64 --> 10324.64]  Can we please
[10324.64 --> 10325.14]  have a way
[10325.14 --> 10326.30]  for digital-only
[10326.30 --> 10327.64]  LTX pass holders
[10327.64 --> 10328.28]  to purchase
[10328.28 --> 10329.42]  a custom-colored
[10329.42 --> 10329.94]  screwdriver?
[10330.38 --> 10331.40]  The flight and hotel
[10331.40 --> 10332.22]  costs would cost me
[10332.22 --> 10333.12]  nearly $2,000.
[10333.12 --> 10334.38]  I wouldn't mind
[10334.38 --> 10335.46]  a $60 tier.
[10339.02 --> 10339.74]  It's tough.
[10339.88 --> 10340.52]  It's very,
[10340.64 --> 10341.02]  very tough
[10341.02 --> 10341.64]  to get those
[10341.64 --> 10342.48]  colorways out.
[10343.00 --> 10343.80]  I think there's
[10343.80 --> 10344.30]  some things
[10344.30 --> 10344.74]  that if we're
[10344.74 --> 10345.40]  being completely
[10345.40 --> 10345.88]  realistic,
[10346.44 --> 10347.18]  there isn't
[10347.18 --> 10347.92]  a feasible way
[10347.92 --> 10348.66]  for us to do it
[10348.66 --> 10349.36]  unless you come
[10349.36 --> 10349.82]  to the show.
[10349.96 --> 10350.40]  And I know
[10350.40 --> 10351.36]  that's a tall ask
[10351.36 --> 10351.94]  and it's not going
[10351.94 --> 10352.66]  to work for everyone,
[10352.98 --> 10354.08]  but it doesn't mean
[10354.08 --> 10354.58]  that we shouldn't
[10354.58 --> 10355.04]  make it cool
[10355.04 --> 10355.50]  for the people
[10355.50 --> 10356.36]  that can show up.
[10357.12 --> 10358.12]  And you have
[10358.12 --> 10358.56]  talked about,
[10358.62 --> 10358.76]  like,
[10358.80 --> 10359.38]  maybe we'll put
[10359.38 --> 10360.32]  some extras up
[10360.32 --> 10360.82]  or something.
[10361.14 --> 10361.90]  They wouldn't be
[10361.90 --> 10363.28]  build to order
[10363.28 --> 10363.58]  though.
[10363.86 --> 10364.64]  Absolutely not.
[10364.74 --> 10365.08]  There'd just be
[10365.08 --> 10365.82]  random colors.
[10365.96 --> 10367.00]  There's just no way
[10367.00 --> 10367.78]  for us to handle
[10367.78 --> 10368.58]  that with our
[10368.58 --> 10369.70]  distribution and
[10369.70 --> 10370.40]  assembly partner.
[10370.68 --> 10371.94]  And it's local.
[10372.32 --> 10372.42]  Like,
[10373.42 --> 10373.94]  someday,
[10374.60 --> 10375.16]  someday,
[10375.76 --> 10376.24]  maybe,
[10377.24 --> 10378.24]  but it is not
[10378.24 --> 10378.84]  something that we're
[10378.84 --> 10379.74]  set up for right now.
[10379.74 --> 10380.86]  If I had to,
[10382.28 --> 10383.68]  I don't know if I
[10383.68 --> 10384.50]  want to throw this
[10384.50 --> 10385.02]  out there,
[10385.60 --> 10386.08]  but hey,
[10386.18 --> 10386.80]  here it goes.
[10386.80 --> 10389.66]  if an enterprising
[10389.66 --> 10390.78]  individual who's
[10390.78 --> 10391.10]  going to be
[10391.10 --> 10392.06]  attending the show
[10392.06 --> 10394.12]  wanted to coordinate
[10394.12 --> 10395.58]  with people who
[10395.58 --> 10396.68]  can't attend the show
[10396.68 --> 10397.80]  and buy more than
[10397.80 --> 10398.60]  one in person,
[10398.86 --> 10399.08]  you know,
[10399.10 --> 10399.90]  that all sounds
[10399.90 --> 10401.86]  very community
[10401.86 --> 10403.32]  oriented and all
[10403.32 --> 10403.72]  that,
[10404.22 --> 10405.54]  but we're not
[10405.54 --> 10406.68]  going to allow
[10406.68 --> 10407.26]  people to buy
[10407.26 --> 10408.38]  100 drivers either,
[10408.60 --> 10409.70]  so don't kid
[10409.70 --> 10410.08]  yourself.
[10410.22 --> 10410.58]  You're not going
[10410.58 --> 10411.30]  to be showing up
[10411.30 --> 10412.12]  and buying our
[10412.12 --> 10412.90]  entire stock
[10412.90 --> 10414.58]  and making a
[10414.58 --> 10416.06]  side hustle business
[10416.06 --> 10416.70]  out of doing this,
[10416.70 --> 10418.14]  but if people
[10418.14 --> 10418.76]  show up and they
[10418.76 --> 10419.44]  buy like two or
[10419.44 --> 10419.74]  three,
[10419.86 --> 10420.22]  we're not going
[10420.22 --> 10420.88]  to tell them no,
[10421.46 --> 10422.40]  so I'd say that
[10422.40 --> 10423.16]  might be a way,
[10423.26 --> 10423.94]  maybe find someone
[10423.94 --> 10424.44]  who's going.
[10425.30 --> 10425.74]  Sorry.
[10428.92 --> 10429.36]  Linus,
[10429.42 --> 10430.44]  being a Supreme
[10430.44 --> 10431.36]  Commander player
[10431.36 --> 10432.36]  and being alive
[10432.36 --> 10433.06]  for as long as
[10433.06 --> 10433.52]  you have,
[10433.82 --> 10435.10]  I assume you've
[10435.10 --> 10436.10]  also experienced
[10436.10 --> 10437.28]  Total Annihilation
[10437.28 --> 10438.10]  and its amazing
[10438.10 --> 10438.52]  music.
[10438.84 --> 10439.12]  What's your
[10439.12 --> 10440.06]  favorite or
[10440.06 --> 10441.28]  favorites video
[10441.28 --> 10441.86]  game soundtrack?
[10442.98 --> 10443.26]  Oh,
[10443.32 --> 10443.52]  wow,
[10443.56 --> 10443.92]  that's a good
[10443.92 --> 10444.38]  question.
[10445.00 --> 10445.42]  Do you have a
[10445.42 --> 10445.92]  favorite video
[10445.92 --> 10446.50]  game soundtrack?
[10446.70 --> 10447.34]  For a long
[10447.34 --> 10447.88]  time it was
[10447.88 --> 10448.64]  the Bastion
[10448.64 --> 10449.14]  soundtrack.
[10449.56 --> 10450.44]  I liked that
[10450.44 --> 10450.90]  a lot.
[10451.54 --> 10452.50]  I used to run
[10452.50 --> 10453.00]  to that all
[10453.00 --> 10453.38]  the time.
[10454.66 --> 10455.54]  I've spent so
[10455.54 --> 10456.02]  much time
[10456.02 --> 10456.52]  listening to
[10456.52 --> 10457.04]  Final Fantasy
[10457.04 --> 10457.46]  6,
[10457.50 --> 10458.22]  I never,
[10458.32 --> 10459.12]  ever get
[10459.12 --> 10459.66]  sick of it.
[10461.26 --> 10462.14]  But there's
[10462.14 --> 10463.06]  some just
[10463.06 --> 10465.00]  amazing main
[10465.00 --> 10465.68]  theme songs.
[10466.70 --> 10467.14]  If I just
[10467.14 --> 10468.00]  had to pick
[10468.00 --> 10469.24]  biggest bangers,
[10469.38 --> 10470.82]  obviously Halo's
[10470.82 --> 10471.32]  got to be up
[10471.32 --> 10471.44]  there.
[10471.44 --> 10474.38]  the Halo intro
[10474.38 --> 10475.00]  is sick.
[10475.16 --> 10476.60]  It's so good,
[10476.72 --> 10476.98]  right?
[10477.08 --> 10477.54]  I've often
[10477.54 --> 10478.12]  been into
[10478.12 --> 10478.96]  music without
[10478.96 --> 10479.80]  lyrics because
[10479.80 --> 10481.36]  that's exactly
[10481.36 --> 10482.14]  enough distraction
[10482.14 --> 10482.74]  for me that I
[10482.74 --> 10483.34]  can stay focused
[10483.34 --> 10484.06]  on things well.
[10484.40 --> 10484.94]  The second you
[10484.94 --> 10485.38]  have lyrics,
[10485.46 --> 10486.06]  I start saying
[10486.06 --> 10486.48]  them in my
[10486.48 --> 10487.88]  head and
[10487.88 --> 10488.72]  it's bad.
[10489.46 --> 10490.34]  So I used to
[10490.34 --> 10490.54]  like,
[10490.64 --> 10491.00]  I would just
[10491.00 --> 10491.46]  put on like
[10491.46 --> 10492.10]  the FTL
[10492.10 --> 10492.56]  soundtrack,
[10493.28 --> 10494.38]  but I don't
[10494.38 --> 10494.74]  think it's
[10494.74 --> 10495.22]  necessarily even
[10495.22 --> 10495.68]  that great.
[10495.76 --> 10495.96]  It was just
[10495.96 --> 10496.40]  something that I
[10496.40 --> 10497.06]  had heard a lot
[10497.06 --> 10497.48]  because I liked
[10497.48 --> 10499.18]  that game for
[10499.18 --> 10499.80]  like chill
[10499.80 --> 10500.28]  vibes.
[10500.38 --> 10500.64]  I used to
[10500.64 --> 10501.08]  like the
[10501.08 --> 10502.18]  Grizzly Hills
[10502.18 --> 10502.90]  ambience.
[10504.66 --> 10505.44]  Just random
[10505.44 --> 10506.12]  stuff like that.
[10506.26 --> 10506.66]  I don't know.
[10507.56 --> 10507.96]  Nobody's talking
[10507.96 --> 10508.54]  about Metal Gear
[10508.54 --> 10508.98]  Rise.
[10509.58 --> 10510.46]  My birds listen
[10510.46 --> 10511.26]  to the Assassin's
[10511.26 --> 10511.98]  Creed 4 sea
[10511.98 --> 10513.34]  shanties all
[10513.34 --> 10514.24]  the time.
[10515.10 --> 10515.60]  Always.
[10515.96 --> 10516.48]  Are they video
[10516.48 --> 10517.00]  calling each
[10517.00 --> 10517.18]  other?
[10518.04 --> 10518.44]  I wish.
[10518.56 --> 10519.04]  That is so
[10519.04 --> 10519.32]  cool.
[10520.10 --> 10520.36]  Okay,
[10520.44 --> 10520.88]  the last one I
[10520.88 --> 10521.24]  have here in
[10521.24 --> 10521.66]  the curated.
[10522.02 --> 10522.44]  Question for
[10522.44 --> 10522.78]  Linus.
[10523.10 --> 10523.88]  In retrospect,
[10524.24 --> 10524.84]  did the roast
[10524.84 --> 10525.28]  of Linus
[10525.28 --> 10526.18]  Sebastian hurt
[10526.18 --> 10526.98]  in the moment?
[10526.98 --> 10527.64]  How do you
[10527.64 --> 10528.02]  feel about
[10528.02 --> 10528.52]  watching it
[10528.52 --> 10529.46]  back if you
[10529.46 --> 10529.98]  ever do?
[10530.44 --> 10530.72]  That was
[10530.72 --> 10531.12]  hilarious.
[10531.60 --> 10531.82]  And it's
[10531.82 --> 10532.42]  still hilarious.
[10533.14 --> 10533.86]  There's so
[10533.86 --> 10535.48]  much, far
[10535.48 --> 10535.84]  too much
[10535.84 --> 10536.52]  truth in
[10536.52 --> 10536.80]  there.
[10540.22 --> 10541.06]  So good.
[10542.12 --> 10542.64]  That's a
[10542.64 --> 10543.14]  proper roast.
[10543.24 --> 10543.56]  It should be
[10543.56 --> 10543.88]  truthful.
[10545.28 --> 10546.20]  And now we're
[10546.20 --> 10546.82]  into potentials
[10546.82 --> 10547.30]  with you guys.
[10547.50 --> 10548.16]  Every time I
[10548.16 --> 10548.90]  watch it back,
[10549.06 --> 10550.02]  I forget
[10550.02 --> 10550.58]  things that
[10550.58 --> 10551.24]  happened and
[10551.24 --> 10552.34]  just burst
[10552.34 --> 10552.94]  out laughing.
[10553.28 --> 10553.50]  Yeah.
[10553.88 --> 10554.82]  So funny.
[10555.70 --> 10556.28]  Oh, man.
[10556.98 --> 10557.64]  Hi, Linus and
[10557.64 --> 10557.84]  Luke.
[10557.92 --> 10558.30]  I really
[10558.30 --> 10559.10]  admire your
[10559.10 --> 10560.14]  leadership skills.
[10560.50 --> 10561.12]  As a business
[10561.12 --> 10561.68]  owner, how do
[10561.68 --> 10562.12]  you go about
[10562.12 --> 10562.80]  developing your
[10562.80 --> 10564.32]  leadership skills and
[10564.32 --> 10565.42]  the philosophy that
[10565.42 --> 10566.22]  lets you guide your
[10566.22 --> 10566.96]  decision making?
[10568.14 --> 10569.18]  I mean, honestly,
[10569.28 --> 10570.08]  so much of it just
[10570.08 --> 10570.78]  comes down to the
[10570.78 --> 10571.28]  golden rule.
[10572.22 --> 10573.82]  Like, maybe part of
[10573.82 --> 10575.74]  it is just because I
[10575.74 --> 10577.38]  did used to work as a
[10577.38 --> 10578.84]  low-level employee and
[10578.84 --> 10580.24]  I do remember it.
[10580.24 --> 10582.46]  It just seems kind of
[10582.46 --> 10583.20]  common sense.
[10584.12 --> 10584.74]  You know, say
[10584.74 --> 10585.18]  please.
[10585.60 --> 10586.48]  Say thank you.
[10588.22 --> 10588.76]  You know, don't
[10588.76 --> 10591.22]  make people feel like
[10591.22 --> 10591.74]  they're being
[10591.74 --> 10592.34]  dismissed.
[10592.58 --> 10593.62]  If they need to be
[10593.62 --> 10595.06]  dismissed, acknowledge
[10595.06 --> 10595.50]  that.
[10595.80 --> 10597.68]  You know, explain why
[10597.68 --> 10598.42]  you have to do it.
[10598.50 --> 10599.28]  Make time later.
[10599.68 --> 10600.40]  Like, just, I don't
[10600.40 --> 10600.62]  know.
[10601.06 --> 10603.16]  Just don't be rude.
[10604.36 --> 10605.30]  It's all Bill and
[10605.30 --> 10605.90]  Ted, right?
[10606.48 --> 10607.50]  Be excellent to each
[10607.50 --> 10607.74]  other.
[10609.80 --> 10610.92]  And if you, if you
[10610.92 --> 10611.66]  can't, if you screw
[10611.66 --> 10613.22]  up sometimes, what,
[10613.22 --> 10614.16]  what is, what is up
[10614.16 --> 10615.28]  with people and
[10615.28 --> 10616.62]  thinking apologizing is
[10616.62 --> 10617.66]  not cool anymore?
[10620.18 --> 10620.86]  Like, you know,
[10620.92 --> 10621.88]  backing, backing
[10621.88 --> 10623.34]  down, you know, you
[10623.34 --> 10624.14]  should never apologize.
[10624.42 --> 10625.04]  Like, what, what,
[10625.04 --> 10625.96]  what's up with that?
[10626.10 --> 10626.52]  I don't know.
[10626.74 --> 10627.48]  If you make a mistake.
[10627.48 --> 10628.08]  Is that a current
[10628.08 --> 10628.38]  thing?
[10628.68 --> 10629.22]  I don't think I've
[10629.22 --> 10629.62]  seen that.
[10629.74 --> 10630.98]  Yeah, you know, no,
[10631.04 --> 10632.08]  it's, it's a thing in
[10632.08 --> 10632.40]  certain.
[10632.50 --> 10633.08]  I believe you.
[10633.16 --> 10633.34]  Yeah.
[10633.46 --> 10633.90]  I don't know.
[10634.12 --> 10634.54]  I don't know.
[10634.60 --> 10635.24]  I think it's really
[10635.24 --> 10635.50]  dumb.
[10636.02 --> 10636.98]  Toxic masculinity?
[10637.50 --> 10638.04]  I don't know.
[10638.24 --> 10639.04]  It's toxic something.
[10639.42 --> 10639.88]  Toxic something.
[10640.74 --> 10641.70]  I've been shopping for
[10641.70 --> 10642.40]  a new ultra wide
[10642.40 --> 10643.74]  monitor and I'm
[10643.74 --> 10644.78]  struggling to figure
[10644.78 --> 10646.14]  out the differences
[10646.14 --> 10647.64]  between HDR 10 or
[10647.64 --> 10649.12]  400 or whatever.
[10651.68 --> 10652.72]  Oh, I see.
[10652.84 --> 10654.40]  So HDR 400 is
[10654.40 --> 10655.18]  nonsense.
[10655.76 --> 10657.38]  HDR 600 is okay.
[10657.38 --> 10658.96]  HDR 1000 is pretty
[10658.96 --> 10659.26]  good.
[10659.36 --> 10660.84]  And those are the
[10660.84 --> 10662.64]  capabilities of your
[10662.64 --> 10663.28]  display.
[10663.40 --> 10664.02]  And then there's also
[10664.02 --> 10665.34]  the like OLED version
[10665.34 --> 10666.44]  version where 600 and
[10666.44 --> 10667.46]  up is, is pretty good
[10667.46 --> 10667.88]  actually.
[10668.58 --> 10671.20]  Um, as for HDR 10
[10671.20 --> 10673.40]  versus Dolby, uh,
[10673.46 --> 10674.72]  Dolby vision versus
[10674.72 --> 10676.78]  HLG, uh, that just
[10676.78 --> 10677.92]  comes down to whatever
[10677.92 --> 10678.82]  content you're going to
[10678.82 --> 10680.64]  be consuming and, uh,
[10680.64 --> 10682.10]  which format it was,
[10682.10 --> 10684.10]  um, mastered in.
[10684.10 --> 10685.62]  So it all comes down to
[10685.62 --> 10686.54]  what content you'll be
[10686.54 --> 10686.98]  consuming.
[10687.48 --> 10690.48]  HDR 10 plus seems like it
[10690.48 --> 10691.94]  might kind of win, but
[10691.94 --> 10693.64]  Dolby vision still doing
[10693.64 --> 10694.22]  pretty good.
[10694.22 --> 10695.46]  And then HLG I think has
[10695.46 --> 10696.50]  pretty good support in TV.
[10696.50 --> 10698.38]  So there's no clear winner.
[10698.38 --> 10699.56]  And what we really need is
[10699.56 --> 10700.94]  someone to, at this point,
[10700.94 --> 10702.72]  to develop a, a metadata
[10702.72 --> 10705.44]  interpreting middleware for
[10705.44 --> 10706.68]  the metadata interpreting
[10706.68 --> 10708.64]  standards so that you can
[10708.64 --> 10710.02]  just interpret all of them
[10710.02 --> 10710.42]  correctly.
[10710.42 --> 10710.84]  I don't know.
[10711.44 --> 10712.50]  Uh, there's devices like
[10712.50 --> 10713.74]  that for home theater use
[10713.74 --> 10714.88]  that will take whatever
[10714.88 --> 10716.76]  content and then, you know,
[10716.88 --> 10718.02]  adjust it so that every
[10718.02 --> 10720.00]  frame is, is perfectly
[10720.00 --> 10720.78]  balanced within the
[10720.78 --> 10721.54]  capabilities of your
[10721.54 --> 10722.48]  display, but they're like
[10722.48 --> 10724.00]  shockingly expensive still.
[10724.10 --> 10725.80]  I think there's one that I
[10725.80 --> 10727.62]  accidentally got rid of.
[10727.72 --> 10728.56]  Do you think we'll ever see
[10728.56 --> 10729.66]  a return of 3ds type
[10729.66 --> 10730.92]  screens on more mainstream
[10730.92 --> 10732.36]  devices like phones or a
[10732.36 --> 10733.18]  Steam Deck competitor and
[10733.18 --> 10733.82]  next gen switch?
[10734.62 --> 10736.08]  Um, we're going to see 3d
[10736.08 --> 10737.66]  laptops with glasses free
[10737.66 --> 10738.48]  3d.
[10738.92 --> 10740.68]  Um, I've seen prototypes
[10740.68 --> 10741.48]  in person.
[10741.62 --> 10743.06]  They look shockingly good.
[10743.26 --> 10744.16]  I don't know that they'll
[10744.16 --> 10744.70]  go mainstream.
[10744.90 --> 10745.68]  I think they might be more
[10745.68 --> 10747.20]  professional, but yeah,
[10747.58 --> 10748.22]  they're really good.
[10749.36 --> 10749.80]  Okay.
[10749.82 --> 10750.46]  Last few here.
[10750.90 --> 10751.96]  Hey, DLL, given the
[10751.96 --> 10753.30]  variations for the WAN
[10753.30 --> 10754.44]  hoodie, what is the
[10754.44 --> 10755.64]  likelihood that we will see
[10755.64 --> 10757.24]  different colorways for the
[10757.24 --> 10757.76]  windbreaker?
[10758.08 --> 10759.30]  I've noticed Linus seems to
[10759.30 --> 10760.26]  wear the short circuit
[10760.26 --> 10761.50]  hoodie most often now.
[10765.12 --> 10765.56]  Hmm.
[10765.56 --> 10768.74]  Oh, sorry.
[10768.82 --> 10769.26]  One second.
[10769.50 --> 10770.50]  I missed a little bit of
[10770.50 --> 10770.78]  that.
[10771.82 --> 10772.38]  You're going to get new
[10772.38 --> 10773.44]  colors for the WAN hoodie.
[10775.04 --> 10776.16]  Not anytime soon.
[10778.28 --> 10779.50]  No, it's going to be WAN and
[10779.50 --> 10780.86]  short circuit for quite a
[10780.86 --> 10781.06]  while.
[10781.74 --> 10783.94]  Hey, DLL, as a Fold4 user,
[10784.08 --> 10785.30]  my biggest gripe is whenever
[10785.30 --> 10787.04]  I fold it closed, it closes
[10787.04 --> 10788.30]  the app and kicks me to the
[10788.30 --> 10788.70]  home screen.
[10789.06 --> 10790.52]  Does yours do this as well?
[10790.94 --> 10791.50]  It's a setting.
[10792.68 --> 10793.74]  There's, you'll have to look
[10793.74 --> 10794.64]  it up, but in the settings,
[10794.64 --> 10796.28]  you can tell it which apps,
[10796.68 --> 10798.12]  app by app, you want to
[10798.12 --> 10799.58]  continue where you left off
[10799.58 --> 10800.50]  if you close the phone.
[10801.02 --> 10802.08]  That's the default behavior,
[10802.18 --> 10802.66]  though, is what you're
[10802.66 --> 10802.88]  seeing.
[10803.66 --> 10804.72]  Hi, me from the future.
[10805.24 --> 10806.46]  Linus, you mentioned during
[10806.46 --> 10808.42]  a Beat Saber live stream that
[10808.42 --> 10809.68]  you were trying the big screen
[10809.68 --> 10811.06]  beyond and it had some
[10811.06 --> 10811.58]  issues.
[10811.90 --> 10812.82]  Have you tested it since?
[10812.98 --> 10814.12]  And what's your review of it?
[10814.32 --> 10815.20]  It's super cool.
[10816.86 --> 10818.46]  I actually have a bunch of
[10818.46 --> 10819.04]  notes on it.
[10819.04 --> 10822.38]  And I think either Adam from
[10822.38 --> 10824.46]  the writing team has not kept
[10824.46 --> 10825.84]  up with talking to them or
[10825.84 --> 10826.82]  they haven't replied.
[10827.36 --> 10828.74]  Either way, you know, I want
[10828.74 --> 10830.04]  to cover it at some point, but
[10830.04 --> 10831.36]  it's been kind of stalled.
[10832.90 --> 10834.36]  So I can just tell you guys what
[10834.36 --> 10835.50]  I have down so far.
[10836.62 --> 10837.28]  I think.
[10838.54 --> 10840.24]  No, I don't see the dock.
[10841.32 --> 10842.02]  Big screen.
[10842.62 --> 10843.74]  Is it big screen one word?
[10843.92 --> 10844.18]  I don't know.
[10844.20 --> 10844.84]  I made a bunch of notes.
[10845.26 --> 10846.96]  Basically, the fineness of the
[10846.96 --> 10847.98]  display is amazing.
[10848.16 --> 10849.60]  The contrast of the display is
[10849.60 --> 10851.24]  so amazing.
[10851.56 --> 10852.46]  Really, really cool.
[10852.60 --> 10853.76]  Yeah, I can't find my dock.
[10853.84 --> 10854.30]  Doesn't matter.
[10855.92 --> 10857.48]  But there's some issues with
[10857.48 --> 10858.78]  the lenses where they kind of
[10858.78 --> 10861.48]  lens flare on bright objects
[10861.48 --> 10863.02]  that I find pretty distracting.
[10863.58 --> 10864.92]  And I'm having an issue that
[10864.92 --> 10865.82]  might have been resolved by
[10865.82 --> 10866.80]  now, but I was having an issue
[10866.80 --> 10868.24]  with the mic a few weeks back
[10868.24 --> 10870.36]  that made it so that if any
[10870.36 --> 10872.52]  application was using the
[10872.52 --> 10875.10]  onboard USB-C audio device,
[10875.74 --> 10877.14]  the microphone wouldn't work
[10877.14 --> 10877.64]  in OBS.
[10877.92 --> 10879.66]  So I couldn't hear my game
[10879.66 --> 10881.04]  and also stream.
[10881.74 --> 10883.62]  So I was like, well, this is
[10883.62 --> 10884.44]  stupid.
[10884.50 --> 10885.44]  I'm not going to use this.
[10886.12 --> 10887.06]  I love the lightweight.
[10887.34 --> 10888.96]  I love the custom fit.
[10889.44 --> 10891.78]  But there's just a deal breaker
[10891.78 --> 10893.12]  that I can't deal with for now.
[10896.06 --> 10898.22]  I think there's four incoming
[10898.22 --> 10899.44]  merch messages that are all
[10899.44 --> 10900.24]  Linus related.
[10900.24 --> 10902.84]  And then we're basically
[10902.84 --> 10903.40]  dunners.
[10904.96 --> 10905.44]  Okay.
[10907.96 --> 10909.24]  Ooh, can you give us some
[10909.24 --> 10910.32]  Linus text tips?
[10911.34 --> 10912.62]  I'm going to go full boomer
[10912.62 --> 10913.92]  and say use lots of emojis.
[10914.52 --> 10914.68]  Nice.
[10914.94 --> 10915.24]  Nice.
[10915.34 --> 10917.96]  Lots of like colon P and,
[10918.14 --> 10918.58]  you know,
[10918.88 --> 10921.90]  I miss emoticons.
[10922.10 --> 10922.94]  I hate emojis.
[10923.42 --> 10923.74]  Me too.
[10923.92 --> 10926.10]  I wish they would not auto
[10926.10 --> 10927.02]  convert as often.
[10927.02 --> 10927.86]  Drives me nuts.
[10928.10 --> 10929.24]  They have more emotion.
[10930.24 --> 10930.46]  Yeah.
[10931.42 --> 10932.86]  How are you liking your Pebble?
[10933.02 --> 10934.16]  Do you plan on paying the
[10934.16 --> 10935.96]  $3 monthly fee for Rebels
[10935.96 --> 10936.96]  voice transcription and
[10936.96 --> 10937.50]  weather services?
[10938.00 --> 10940.20]  I still haven't taken the
[10940.20 --> 10941.58]  10 minutes to figure out how
[10941.58 --> 10943.08]  Rebel works and sideload the
[10943.08 --> 10943.56]  Pebble app.
[10943.68 --> 10944.86]  So I've actually just been
[10944.86 --> 10946.02]  wearing it ornamentally.
[10947.18 --> 10949.28]  I will get around to it at
[10949.28 --> 10949.76]  some point.
[10950.52 --> 10951.86]  I'm pretty sure watches are
[10951.86 --> 10953.06]  just fashion accessories at
[10953.06 --> 10953.42]  this point.
[10953.42 --> 10957.26]  I think Nick like seriously
[10957.26 --> 10957.76]  uses his,
[10957.84 --> 10958.66]  but he's the only person I
[10958.66 --> 10959.06]  know that does.
[10960.58 --> 10960.98]  Ethan,
[10961.18 --> 10961.62]  honestly,
[10961.68 --> 10962.30]  I don't know what to tell
[10962.30 --> 10963.00]  you other than that.
[10963.20 --> 10964.90]  It's really tough sometimes.
[10966.52 --> 10968.64]  I just get distracted and
[10968.64 --> 10969.98]  stuff languishes.
[10969.98 --> 10973.94]  Are there any other companies
[10973.94 --> 10976.62]  you draw inspiration from in
[10976.62 --> 10977.58]  conducting business?
[10979.58 --> 10981.16]  Most are kind of sucky.
[10982.24 --> 10983.20]  Noctua is a big one.
[10983.70 --> 10984.38]  I like their,
[10984.38 --> 10985.72]  I like their philosophy when it
[10985.72 --> 10987.52]  comes to only releasing
[10987.52 --> 10988.58]  products when they're ready.
[10989.58 --> 10991.14]  Are there any that you draw
[10991.14 --> 10991.92]  inspiration from?
[10992.72 --> 10993.16]  Um,
[10993.28 --> 10994.36]  honestly,
[10994.86 --> 10995.38]  no,
[10995.48 --> 10996.60]  it's kind of hard to get
[10996.60 --> 10997.74]  inspiration for the type of
[10997.74 --> 10999.74]  stuff that we do.
[11000.26 --> 11000.66]  Um,
[11001.02 --> 11002.52]  when like everyone in the space
[11002.52 --> 11004.30]  is chasing VC money and
[11004.30 --> 11004.76]  buyouts.
[11005.02 --> 11005.60]  I mean,
[11005.78 --> 11007.38]  you could say the opposite.
[11007.78 --> 11008.18]  Um,
[11008.64 --> 11009.68]  they're inspiring because
[11009.68 --> 11010.66]  they're doing bad and you
[11010.66 --> 11011.80]  want to do what they're not
[11011.80 --> 11012.02]  doing.
[11012.26 --> 11012.52]  They're not doing bad though.
[11013.04 --> 11013.30]  No,
[11013.46 --> 11013.66]  I mean.
[11013.76 --> 11014.16]  I wouldn't say they're doing
[11014.16 --> 11014.46]  bad.
[11014.56 --> 11015.06]  I am,
[11015.30 --> 11016.48]  I know a lot of people that
[11016.48 --> 11018.02]  are doing great following
[11018.02 --> 11019.14]  models that aren't ours.
[11019.32 --> 11020.10]  For Linus's,
[11020.48 --> 11020.82]  you know,
[11021.06 --> 11021.62]  they're sucky.
[11021.62 --> 11022.30]  As you said.
[11022.60 --> 11022.74]  Yeah.
[11022.86 --> 11023.12]  Maybe.
[11024.06 --> 11024.66]  Last one.
[11024.92 --> 11025.70]  I swiped away a thing.
[11026.12 --> 11026.44]  Um,
[11026.52 --> 11027.32]  have you ever heard of the
[11027.32 --> 11028.00]  Black Mages?
[11028.52 --> 11029.80]  It's a metal rock band that
[11029.80 --> 11030.64]  covers Final Fantasy
[11030.64 --> 11031.26]  soundtracks.
[11031.28 --> 11032.28]  I'm sure Conrad has.
[11032.74 --> 11033.36]  I haven't,
[11033.40 --> 11033.86]  I'm afraid.
[11034.26 --> 11034.44]  Uh,
[11034.44 --> 11035.14]  thoughts on a motherboard
[11035.14 --> 11036.32]  throw cover for couches
[11036.32 --> 11037.16]  with the CP pillow?
[11037.24 --> 11037.34]  Yeah,
[11037.36 --> 11038.28]  we wanted to do a blanket,
[11038.50 --> 11039.78]  but all the samples we got
[11039.78 --> 11040.32]  were awful.
[11040.66 --> 11041.22]  So we didn't.
[11042.10 --> 11042.80]  And that was that.
[11043.58 --> 11043.94]  Um,
[11043.94 --> 11045.06]  glad you like your shirt.
[11045.26 --> 11045.62]  Travis.
[11046.92 --> 11047.28]  Show?
[11047.50 --> 11047.86]  Archive?
[11047.96 --> 11048.72]  I can't do anything with
[11048.72 --> 11049.52]  that one for some reason.
[11049.64 --> 11049.76]  Oh,
[11049.82 --> 11050.28]  and it's gone.
[11050.72 --> 11050.86]  Uh,
[11050.86 --> 11051.42]  do you have any plans
[11051.42 --> 11052.24]  on making a mask
[11052.24 --> 11052.94]  for the Windbreaker
[11052.94 --> 11054.04]  to protect your face
[11054.04 --> 11055.08]  against rain and wind?
[11056.58 --> 11056.94]  No,
[11056.98 --> 11057.60]  I can't say that
[11057.60 --> 11058.56]  ever occurred to me.
[11058.94 --> 11060.26]  Probably not anytime soon.
[11060.88 --> 11061.24]  And,
[11062.08 --> 11062.26]  hey,
[11062.34 --> 11063.00]  are you going to be on time
[11063.00 --> 11063.42]  for your thing?
[11063.74 --> 11063.92]  Yeah.
[11066.72 --> 11067.52]  Thanks for tuning in.
[11067.72 --> 11068.88]  We'll see you again next week.
[11069.12 --> 11069.72]  Same bad time,
[11070.06 --> 11070.64]  same bad channel.

[11098.60 --> 11099.60]  Bye!
[11099.60 --> 11101.04]  Like the composer of like,

[11103.60 --> 11104.10]  Wow!
[11104.10 --> 11104.86]  Yeah, that's cool.
[11104.86 --> 11106.86]  So it's not just like random.
