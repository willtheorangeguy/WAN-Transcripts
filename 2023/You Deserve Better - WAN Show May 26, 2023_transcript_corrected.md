[0.00 → 6.44] Welcome to the WAN show everyone. The truth is, I screwed up this week.
[6.44 → 6.88] Yeah.
[7.36 → 12.20] It's very obvious that, I mean, I just, I couldn't conceal it anymore.
[12.56 → 16.72] We were paid by NVIDIA for our RTX 4060 Ti review.
[17.36 → 23.44] And the scariest part of what I just said is that a not insignificant number of people
[23.44 → 28.06] are going to take that at face value, not watch any more of the video,
[28.06 → 31.46] and believe it for the rest of their days.
[31.58 → 36.14] Let's talk about how confusing people found our review of the 4060 Ti.
[36.44 → 42.50] We're also going to be talking to you guys about how confusing I'm finding Sony's new handheld accessory.
[43.38 → 47.92] It's a Wi-Fi based PlayStation 5 streaming thing.
[48.16 → 50.76] Did they learn nothing from the Nintendo Wii U?
[50.90 → 52.56] What else we got going on this week?
[52.74 → 57.04] It does seem like the Wii U was just like actually too early at this point.
[57.04 → 58.24] It's starting to feel that way.
[58.46 → 59.58] It really, really feels like it.
[60.62 → 61.02] Wow.
[61.98 → 63.00] Invisible PC setup.
[63.12 → 64.28] This was actually super cool.
[64.36 → 64.96] Did you see this?
[65.68 → 66.44] I read the comments.
[66.58 → 66.96] Oh, great.
[67.02 → 71.14] We'll talk about it later because you'll probably need to see it if you want to talk about it more specifically.
[71.46 → 72.10] But who knows?
[72.24 → 72.50] Maybe.
[72.64 → 73.04] We'll see.
[73.04 → 79.60] The National Eating Disorders Association replaced a helpline with a chatbot.
[79.60 → 83.96] Because clearly no one there has watched the WAN show.
[83.96 → 85.12] Oh.
[85.12 → 85.70] Oh.
[85.70 → 85.92] Oh.
[85.92 → 111.10] The show is brought to you today by Messi, Signal Wire, and Corsair.
[111.10 → 112.24] All right.
[112.26 → 114.90] We're going to jump over to my laptop here.
[115.12 → 122.38] And this is one of those things where, Luke, I feel like we need to open the conversation back up.
[123.20 → 126.08] Open it back up about shadow-banning comments.
[126.08 → 126.76] Shadow banning people.
[126.84 → 127.16] Do it.
[127.68 → 128.00] Because.
[128.34 → 128.86] Just do it.
[128.86 → 134.46] I actually found the comment section of this video extremely difficult to handle.
[137.40 → 138.04] Let's see.
[138.14 → 139.28] See, some people get it.
[139.68 → 141.36] Please keep calling out this nonsense.
[141.88 → 145.46] This was an extremely negative review.
[145.58 → 149.34] It started with, oh, thank you, NVIDIA.
[149.54 → 152.44] At least you didn't downgrade this graphics card.
[152.44 → 160.26] I literally, literally said something actually positive after some negative things.
[160.38 → 164.50] And then I said, okay, that last one wasn't sarcastic.
[165.26 → 173.92] Because I am aware that a not insignificant portion of our audience does have a little bit of trouble picking up on sarcasm.
[174.08 → 179.26] Whether it's like a social cue challenge thing or whether it's the fact that English isn't their second language.
[179.62 → 180.70] English is a really weird language.
[180.86 → 182.12] Rather, is their second language.
[182.12 → 182.58] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[182.74 → 186.42] So I made it actually explicit.
[187.70 → 191.78] And the number of comments that are just.
[193.78 → 195.36] Let me see if I can.
[195.40 → 196.32] Let me see if I can.
[196.44 → 197.64] Let me see if I can find this.
[201.02 → 201.70] Oh, man.
[201.88 → 203.22] This is frustrating.
[203.54 → 204.70] The second you need them, they're not there.
[204.76 → 206.44] Yeah, the second when I need it.
[206.50 → 206.80] Yeah.
[207.14 → 208.28] It's not there.
[208.28 → 211.80] That's just how presenting things on stage or on camera.
[211.80 → 213.06] It's just how it works.
[213.14 → 213.92] Okay, where's my phone?
[214.00 → 215.34] Because I sent you one on Discord.
[215.54 → 218.60] That was just absolutely mind-blowing.
[218.74 → 220.84] The point is not to call out any specific user.
[220.84 → 221.86] Don't go looking for this.
[222.14 → 223.96] But I've got a couple comments in a row here.
[224.30 → 226.64] Like, why can't you just say it's a bad deal?
[227.14 → 228.38] You're not crapping on NVIDIA.
[228.46 → 230.50] Makes it look like you're caping for NVIDIA.
[230.84 → 233.18] Not saying you are, but that's what it looks like.
[233.46 → 235.38] This review also feels short and unrigorous.
[235.38 → 236.06] Unrigorous.
[236.60 → 238.44] This is a rare thumbs down for me.
[238.80 → 246.64] We had probably more game benchmarking than we've ever had before.
[247.78 → 248.74] Extremely rigorous.
[248.98 → 250.64] The whole thing is automated now.
[251.08 → 253.22] All of our testing, this is something to note,
[253.50 → 258.46] all of our testing was fresh on the latest drivers for every one of those cards.
[258.46 → 262.72] That is extremely unusual, but it's also extremely important.
[263.12 → 266.96] I mean, you can include numbers from three months ago or six months ago,
[267.04 → 269.72] but as we've seen, especially with Intel Arc,
[270.00 → 272.16] and especially when AMD launches anything,
[272.60 → 275.16] within a span of two, three, six months,
[275.98 → 278.88] you might as well just say,
[279.42 → 282.70] I hate AMD and don't feel like showing them in a fair light.
[282.88 → 284.12] You might as well just say that,
[284.12 → 286.30] because if you're not including fresh numbers,
[287.22 → 288.56] that's not valid.
[288.82 → 290.24] It's just actually useless.
[290.38 → 292.22] You might as well just kind of go,
[292.46 → 293.36] you might as well approximate.
[294.04 → 295.46] Well, I didn't have the XT,
[295.64 → 296.84] so I, I don't know,
[296.90 → 299.44] it has 10% more CU's,
[299.46 → 300.92] so I bumped the clock speed 10%.
[300.92 → 301.70] This is an approximation.
[302.26 → 303.40] And you know what?
[303.42 → 304.96] It would probably be reasonably close,
[305.48 → 308.68] but it's disingenuous to label the chart,
[308.90 → 311.36] you know, 6700 XT or whatever it is.
[311.80 → 312.82] This next one.
[314.12 → 314.78] Thank you.
[315.72 → 317.44] I haven't been watching LTT,
[317.62 → 318.98] and now I remember why.
[319.28 → 320.54] The only reason I clicked
[320.54 → 322.46] was I was hoping the title was sarcasm,
[322.60 → 325.36] but weird how he kept looking for positive things to say
[325.36 → 326.90] when the card is straight up garbage,
[327.22 → 329.10] trying to stay in NVIDIA's Good Books.
[329.28 → 331.40] I haven't been in NVIDIA's Good Books
[331.40 → 334.20] for like a couple of years now.
[335.80 → 337.68] That's not how this works.
[337.92 → 339.64] That's not how any of this works.
[339.64 → 344.06] The reason that we're looking for positive things to say
[344.06 → 346.68] is because our reviews are designed
[346.68 → 349.18] to be everything you need to know about the card.
[349.60 → 350.46] And the price,
[351.00 → 352.98] the price is fluid, right?
[353.24 → 355.82] So if you come back to this video in a couple of years,
[355.82 → 357.04] and you want to know,
[357.24 → 358.56] what features does it have?
[359.22 → 361.08] How does it compare to the cards
[361.08 → 362.50] that are, you know,
[362.58 → 363.90] similar around it?
[363.90 → 364.78] And honestly,
[364.90 → 367.54] one of the things the labs did a great job of this time
[367.54 → 369.36] was including older cards.
[369.96 → 373.22] The number of positive comments we got from people saying,
[373.86 → 375.98] wow, thank you so much
[375.98 → 379.06] for putting a couple of older cards on the graph for a change.
[379.44 → 381.66] Now I have some idea how this compares
[381.66 → 383.80] when I'm looking for an upgrade
[383.80 → 385.34] was really awesome.
[385.54 → 388.10] I just want to give a huge shout-out to the writers,
[388.54 → 389.88] huge shout out to the lab.
[389.88 → 392.06] I'm actually really, really proud
[392.06 → 394.18] of our 4060 Ti review
[394.18 → 396.70] and our RX 7600 review.
[396.88 → 398.32] There are a couple of things we got wrong.
[398.40 → 401.26] I think we had a table in the 4060 Ti review
[401.26 → 403.00] that said it had a 16X interface.
[403.08 → 404.14] It has an 8X interface.
[404.64 → 405.66] That is a problem
[405.66 → 407.42] if you're upgrading an older platform.
[408.06 → 409.26] On a modern platform,
[409.38 → 410.12] it's not a problem.
[410.24 → 412.84] It doesn't affect the numbers that we showed you guys,
[413.22 → 414.24] but that is something
[414.24 → 416.04] that we could have gotten a little bit better.
[416.16 → 417.24] And I think there were a couple of small things
[417.24 → 417.90] in the 7600,
[417.90 → 421.68] but every time we release a new GPU review,
[421.68 → 423.74] we're getting a little bit cleaner about it.
[423.84 → 424.22] It's just,
[424.40 → 425.68] it's a lot of moving parts, guys.
[427.36 → 428.68] But this is one of those things
[428.68 → 430.10] that I'm just looking at going,
[430.74 → 434.64] give me a reason not to start shadow-banning again.
[434.76 → 437.28] Like this is another one that I saw on today's video.
[437.38 → 438.06] It was a short
[438.06 → 440.48] on the Billy gold play button
[440.48 → 441.00] that we got
[441.00 → 443.12] for reaching a million subscribers on Billy.
[443.22 → 443.74] Yeah, super cool.
[443.74 → 445.70] Which is super awesome.
[445.92 → 447.62] Like huge shout out.
[448.08 → 450.78] Dennis has been deeply involved in that over the years.
[450.94 → 451.38] The whole time.
[451.48 → 453.60] Andy's been involved in that over the years
[453.60 → 454.12] and, you know,
[454.16 → 455.96] helped foster the community over there.
[456.08 → 458.28] Our translation team over in China,
[458.66 → 460.84] all the members past and present,
[461.26 → 463.06] just shout out all those people
[463.06 → 464.68] for making this possible.
[464.68 → 466.54] And, you know,
[466.60 → 467.58] this is the takeaway
[467.58 → 469.16] that someone got.
[469.58 → 470.78] Was not expecting Linus
[470.78 → 471.96] to take a knee to China
[471.96 → 473.66] after saying he will never visit
[473.66 → 474.68] because of the CCP.
[475.28 → 476.00] What a hypocrite.
[477.52 → 478.68] So here's something.
[479.06 → 480.70] It actually costs us money
[480.70 → 482.18] to run that Chinese channel.
[482.82 → 482.92] I,
[483.54 → 483.82] because
[483.82 → 485.94] I won't go to China anymore,
[485.94 → 487.00] I have no way
[487.00 → 488.56] of getting any of the ad revenue
[488.56 → 489.96] that we've made from that channel
[489.96 → 491.08] out of it,
[491.30 → 491.94] out of China.
[492.00 → 493.00] It's all just stuck there.
[493.00 → 494.54] It's just something where
[494.54 → 496.46] there was a fan group
[496.46 → 498.14] that was translating our videos,
[498.72 → 499.38] pirating them,
[499.52 → 500.60] uploading them to Billy.
[500.72 → 501.38] And we kind of went,
[501.52 → 501.72] hey,
[502.70 → 503.82] please don't do that.
[503.92 → 505.12] But how about this?
[505.18 → 507.20] How about we actually compensate you for it
[507.20 → 508.94] and we'll make the whole thing official.
[509.36 → 510.86] And that way we can,
[511.00 → 512.78] we can have a proper presence there
[512.78 → 513.86] with translations
[513.86 → 515.36] and all that good stuff.
[515.36 → 516.76] If it's going to get pirated anyway,
[516.92 → 518.54] we might as well do it properly.
[518.92 → 520.08] We might as well do it properly.
[520.54 → 521.84] And it's just one of those things
[521.84 → 522.86] that I look at, and I go,
[523.76 → 524.06] you know,
[524.64 → 525.60] why do I have to read that?
[525.68 → 526.46] Why do I ever,
[527.08 → 527.94] whether you're trolling,
[528.40 → 529.24] which honestly,
[529.38 → 530.18] I don't think so.
[530.36 → 531.98] I've got a pretty good radar
[531.98 → 532.82] for it these days.
[533.46 → 533.82] No,
[533.92 → 535.38] some people actually are
[535.38 → 536.14] that brain-dead.
[536.68 → 537.88] So whether you're trolling,
[538.12 → 538.82] if you are,
[539.06 → 540.10] or whether your takes
[540.10 → 541.12] are just that bad.
[542.22 → 542.90] I just,
[543.06 → 545.04] I used to care about this a lot.
[545.74 → 546.72] Like shadow-banning?
[546.92 → 547.04] Yeah.
[547.36 → 548.52] Like thinking it was a bad thing.
[548.64 → 548.80] Yeah.
[549.46 → 550.44] And then what happened?
[550.52 → 551.82] Is it just because I send you these?
[551.82 → 552.90] I haven't even sort of anymore.
[553.16 → 554.98] Like I'm actually completely
[554.98 → 556.08] on the other side now.
[556.16 → 557.70] And this might piss some people off,
[557.76 → 558.86] but it's just the reality.
[559.14 → 559.98] In my opinion,
[560.74 → 562.70] back when I was a stalwart defender
[562.70 → 563.18] of like,
[563.28 → 564.46] you shouldn't ban people,
[564.58 → 565.78] the internet was in
[565.78 → 567.10] a bit of a different spot.
[567.10 → 569.38] And now like,
[570.04 → 571.66] I don't know.
[572.58 → 574.76] You get how many comments every day?
[575.64 → 576.24] And it's like,
[576.48 → 576.72] yeah,
[576.88 → 577.44] I don't know.
[578.28 → 580.12] Is that helping anything?
[580.36 → 580.56] Yeah.
[581.28 → 581.52] Like,
[581.56 → 582.78] like actually at all.
[582.90 → 583.36] Is this,
[583.40 → 585.06] is this beneficial for anything?
[585.30 → 586.80] Are you going to change anything?
[586.98 → 587.26] Is this,
[587.38 → 588.94] is any discourse coming from this
[588.94 → 589.48] that is helpful?
[589.48 → 589.66] Yeah.
[589.72 → 590.28] So I've been scrolling.
[590.42 → 590.90] Here's another one.
[591.02 → 592.54] This review was way too lenient.
[593.12 → 594.90] This card is garbage.
[594.98 → 595.64] End of story.
[596.24 → 597.06] It's not garbage.
[597.22 → 597.70] That's just,
[598.20 → 599.86] I don't know what to tell you.
[600.24 → 601.26] It's not garbage.
[601.40 → 602.08] I feel like,
[602.48 → 604.70] I feel like people have gotten
[604.70 → 605.92] kind of twisted,
[607.38 → 609.60] like a twisted perception
[609.60 → 612.02] of what garbage is.
[612.90 → 613.92] At the right price,
[614.32 → 615.20] it does it,
[615.42 → 617.28] do you plug it into your computer?
[617.54 → 619.26] And does its hart FPS
[619.26 → 620.22] onto your monitor?
[620.22 → 623.30] Does it do so without overheating?
[623.80 → 625.56] Without causing blue screens?
[626.22 → 626.70] Does it,
[626.82 → 628.14] does it harm your dog?
[628.26 → 628.48] You know,
[628.52 → 628.68] like,
[628.76 → 629.12] is it,
[629.36 → 630.38] is it bad?
[631.28 → 631.60] No.
[632.20 → 633.04] It's overpriced.
[633.06 → 633.78] It's just not worth it.
[633.96 → 635.02] That's its problem.
[635.20 → 635.36] Yeah.
[635.52 → 636.68] Nvidia is marketing
[636.68 → 638.76] a 50 series card
[638.76 → 641.42] as a 60 Ti card.
[641.42 → 642.04] And that's a problem.
[642.10 → 643.26] And pricing it as such.
[643.38 → 643.58] Yeah.
[643.68 → 644.70] And that's a problem.
[645.36 → 647.64] But it doesn't make it garbage.
[647.64 → 650.48] It makes it overpriced.
[650.56 → 651.64] Like if you found it
[651.64 → 652.60] and it was that card
[652.60 → 653.90] and it was on a mad discount.
[654.54 → 654.80] Yeah.
[654.94 → 655.56] Maybe it's all right.
[656.22 → 656.62] Absolutely.
[657.34 → 658.88] And happy 4534.
[659.00 → 660.00] There's no criticism allowed
[660.00 → 660.74] on LTT videos,
[660.78 → 661.00] I guess.
[661.06 → 661.70] Say anything bad,
[661.74 → 662.30] they shadow-ban you.
[662.40 → 662.68] See,
[662.72 → 663.54] that's not true at all.
[664.28 → 664.74] You know,
[664.76 → 665.68] we have no problem.
[665.90 → 666.00] That is not the point.
[666.16 → 667.00] We have no problem
[667.00 → 668.08] with constructive criticism.
[668.74 → 669.36] What it is,
[669.40 → 669.80] is I just,
[670.22 → 670.52] I don't.
[670.96 → 671.78] Disingenuous arguments
[671.78 → 673.00] starting to,
[673.28 → 674.36] trying to start things
[674.36 → 674.86] just for the sake
[674.86 → 675.60] of trying to start things.
[675.68 → 675.86] Like,
[676.22 → 676.54] I don't know.
[676.54 → 677.38] Yeah.
[678.70 → 679.32] I just,
[679.40 → 680.60] I just can't.
[683.76 → 684.16] And,
[684.32 → 684.80] oh man,
[684.94 → 686.00] we've actually got a video
[686.00 → 686.78] coming where I,
[686.86 → 687.54] I kind of,
[687.54 → 688.50] I kind of lean into this.
[688.54 → 689.68] I was having some fun with it.
[690.34 → 691.64] I kind of brought back
[691.64 → 692.90] the Scrapyard War spirit though.
[693.90 → 695.54] So everyone's getting kind of,
[695.62 → 695.96] you know,
[696.14 → 696.96] mad at me
[696.96 → 698.36] for not going hard enough
[698.36 → 698.80] on NVIDIA.
[698.86 → 699.58] And I shouldn't say everyone.
[699.70 → 699.80] I mean,
[699.82 → 700.66] the like-dislike ratio
[700.66 → 701.18] on that video
[701.18 → 702.74] is still about 92%,
[702.74 → 704.18] 93% or something like that.
[704.18 → 705.10] It might even be higher now
[705.10 → 706.50] because it tends to be
[706.50 → 708.28] that it's that initial rush
[708.28 → 708.74] of people,
[708.86 → 710.40] like the really hardcore tech people
[710.40 → 710.82] that are like,
[710.86 → 711.02] oh,
[711.08 → 712.94] this review wasn't critical enough
[712.94 → 713.82] or whatever the case may be.
[714.10 → 714.96] But the number of people
[714.96 → 716.32] that are mad at me
[716.32 → 717.72] for not going hard enough
[717.72 → 718.32] at NVIDIA
[718.32 → 719.16] is if I have
[719.16 → 720.86] any kind of influence
[720.86 → 722.36] whatsoever on NVIDIA.
[722.50 → 723.64] It's just comical to me
[723.64 → 724.14] at this point.
[724.48 → 726.32] So I wrote up a little intro
[726.32 → 727.60] because,
[728.44 → 730.04] I wanted to address that,
[730.10 → 730.28] right?
[730.28 → 731.62] So it kind of,
[731.70 → 732.86] it kind of goes along the lines
[732.86 → 733.10] of like,
[733.12 → 735.22] are you tired of GPU manufacturers
[735.22 → 736.62] screwing over your wallet?
[737.20 → 737.54] Well,
[738.08 → 739.34] it's time to take action.
[739.64 → 739.84] Here,
[740.04 → 741.22] let me show you what to do.
[741.36 → 742.50] And I kind of do a little flourish
[742.50 → 743.16] with my wallet
[743.16 → 744.68] and put it in my pocket.
[745.06 → 745.38] And then,
[745.50 → 745.82] do you remember
[745.82 → 747.14] the Windows 3.1 sound
[747.14 → 747.52] that's like,
[747.68 → 748.10] Dada!
[751.02 → 751.88] I did it.
[752.22 → 753.18] I didn't open it.
[753.66 → 754.64] Then I worked with Nicole
[754.64 → 755.42] from the
[755.46 → 756.68] from the editing team
[756.68 → 757.28] to,
[757.28 → 758.98] there's this really cool
[758.98 → 760.58] transition that we can do
[760.58 → 762.08] where if you do a whip pan
[762.08 → 764.42] and then a whip pan back,
[764.54 → 765.34] you can use two
[765.34 → 766.88] completely different shots
[766.88 → 768.40] as long as that blur
[768.40 → 769.48] is of approximately
[769.48 → 770.54] the same things.
[770.72 → 772.24] So it actually whips
[772.24 → 773.36] away from me
[773.36 → 774.50] to me
[774.50 → 776.02] standing in the studio
[776.02 → 777.30] and I'm like,
[777.78 → 779.24] your performative boycott
[779.24 → 779.96] means nothing!
[780.34 → 781.44] You have more than enough
[781.44 → 782.44] GPUs for a
[782.52 → 782.74] like,
[782.80 → 784.54] I basically get to be my own
[784.54 → 785.32] like,
[785.42 → 786.16] peanut gallery.
[786.16 → 788.32] Your performative boycott
[788.32 → 789.10] means nothing!
[789.26 → 789.58] Blah, blah,
[789.74 → 789.98] you're,
[790.44 → 790.82] anyway.
[792.64 → 793.72] And I'm like,
[793.76 → 794.02] boo!
[794.30 → 794.80] And then it is like,
[794.84 → 795.62] whips back to me.
[796.06 → 798.24] And it was a really fun video
[798.24 → 798.58] because
[798.58 → 800.04] I basically went
[800.04 → 800.94] Scrapyard Wars shopping
[800.94 → 802.16] and showed that
[802.16 → 802.72] you can get
[802.72 → 804.56] a sick system upgrade
[804.56 → 806.42] for a great price
[806.42 → 806.80] right now.
[806.80 → 807.40] Is it getting better?
[807.56 → 807.72] Good.
[807.72 → 808.42] And not giving
[808.42 → 809.26] Vida or AMD
[809.26 → 809.56] any money.
[809.66 → 810.12] In fact,
[810.12 → 812.36] I had so much fun
[812.36 → 816.98] that I'm kind of thinking
[816.98 → 820.46] we might have to bring it back.
[820.78 → 821.24] No way!
[821.52 → 823.02] I think we might have to!
[823.10 → 823.46] No way!
[823.52 → 824.48] It was so fun!
[825.04 → 825.28] Man,
[825.70 → 826.20] I...
[826.20 → 827.26] We're back, boys!
[827.46 → 828.22] Let's go!
[828.34 → 829.22] I basically set,
[829.22 → 831.28] I set a budget for myself.
[832.16 → 833.06] All right.
[833.36 → 834.80] I set a budget for myself
[834.80 → 837.10] of approximately
[837.10 → 839.94] the price of a 4060 Ti.
[840.50 → 840.74] Okay.
[840.96 → 842.32] I managed to beat it
[842.32 → 843.84] by about 30%
[843.84 → 845.34] while still saving
[845.34 → 846.20] like 20 bucks.
[846.86 → 847.04] Oh,
[847.20 → 848.10] performance beat it
[848.10 → 848.46] by 30%?
[848.46 → 848.94] Oh, yeah!
[849.14 → 849.92] And saved 20 bucks.
[849.92 → 850.36] Oh, yeah!
[850.82 → 851.48] Scrapyard Wars!
[851.66 → 852.70] Oh, that's the best!
[852.70 → 853.16] And,
[853.32 → 855.10] I have almost a year
[855.10 → 855.82] of warranty
[855.82 → 857.26] on the card I got.
[859.32 → 860.00] Okay.
[860.24 → 861.34] What could go wrong?
[862.36 → 863.18] That's sick.
[863.28 → 864.10] I won and won
[864.10 → 865.22] and won some more
[865.22 → 866.42] and I got a video out of it
[866.42 → 867.58] which is winning four times.
[867.64 → 868.52] That's a win.
[868.72 → 869.40] Yeah, exactly.
[870.12 → 870.52] And so,
[870.66 → 871.86] I'm looking at it going like,
[872.82 → 873.26] oh, yeah,
[873.40 → 874.48] we got another comment
[874.48 → 875.16] over here on the 40...
[875.16 → 875.94] He must have been paid
[875.94 → 876.66] to review this card.
[877.14 → 878.16] People like that
[878.16 → 879.96] clearly have no idea
[879.96 → 880.84] what it's like
[880.84 → 882.48] to work with a brand
[882.48 → 883.84] on a paid promotion.
[884.36 → 885.08] You do.
[885.28 → 885.60] Yeah.
[886.00 → 887.12] Would you be allowed
[887.12 → 888.96] to open with a sarcastic...
[888.96 → 889.06] No.
[889.24 → 889.62] Oh,
[889.88 → 890.74] thank you,
[890.84 → 891.34] NVIDIA,
[891.54 → 892.34] for at least not
[892.34 → 893.48] taking away
[893.48 → 894.40] any VRAM.
[894.60 → 894.88] No.
[895.76 → 896.52] Not even sort of.
[897.20 → 897.66] You sure?
[897.88 → 898.10] Yeah.
[898.24 → 898.78] Are you sure?
[899.14 → 899.50] Dude,
[899.62 → 899.70] we've had...
[899.70 → 900.46] Because it seems like
[900.46 → 901.38] you would be able to.
[902.38 → 903.56] Based on some of the comments.
[903.62 → 903.84] Yeah.
[904.80 → 905.88] I wonder how much...
[905.88 → 906.48] Here's another one right under it.
[906.48 → 907.28] We've had stuff kick back
[907.28 → 908.66] for like a lot less than that.
[908.78 → 909.96] This is great.
[911.40 → 911.98] Hold on.
[912.06 → 912.32] Hold on.
[912.36 → 913.16] Where did it go?
[913.28 → 914.72] Must have been paid.
[915.16 → 915.88] Super cool.
[916.04 → 916.36] Excellent.
[916.70 → 917.34] Smart comment.
[917.72 → 918.82] Wonder how much they paid.
[919.50 → 921.32] This video doesn't feel so honest,
[921.44 → 923.14] but I get it from a business perspective.
[923.92 → 924.32] No.
[925.66 → 927.16] You actually don't.
[927.50 → 928.60] You get nothing.
[928.92 → 929.88] You're not on our side.
[930.06 → 931.44] You missed the whole thing.
[932.44 → 933.20] Whoosh, whoosh.
[933.52 → 934.60] Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.
[935.60 → 937.30] Yeah, I don't know.
[938.00 → 938.92] I just...
[938.92 → 939.32] Anyway.
[940.18 → 940.62] Massive,
[940.70 → 941.72] massive shout out to the team.
[941.86 → 942.66] Really, really happy
[942.66 → 943.28] with those reviews.
[943.46 → 944.12] Really excited
[944.12 → 944.76] for the direction
[944.76 → 945.60] the lab is going.
[946.02 → 947.94] We've had some really cool
[947.94 → 949.50] and exciting meetings lately
[949.50 → 950.52] with the team over there.
[950.58 → 951.50] I think we're going to be ready
[951.50 → 952.20] to roll out
[952.20 → 954.58] some of the category-specific channels
[954.58 → 956.38] because I think I've talked about this
[956.38 → 957.48] on the WAN show before,
[957.88 → 961.00] but one of the directions
[961.00 → 963.22] that I see online content going
[963.22 → 965.88] is I see mega channels
[965.88 → 969.72] like the MKBHDs and LTTs.
[970.02 → 971.52] Actually, even to a lesser degree,
[972.02 → 972.46] Marquez,
[972.58 → 974.46] because he is kind of niche-focused.
[974.50 → 975.14] A little bit more focused.
[975.14 → 977.16] Especially now that he's split cars
[977.16 → 980.76] off of MKBHD onto autofocus.
[980.96 → 981.08] Yeah.
[981.26 → 985.26] It's kind of mobile devices
[985.26 → 986.88] and consumer electronics.
[987.70 → 989.80] So it's relatively narrowly focused, right?
[989.94 → 991.34] Compared to ours.
[991.44 → 993.10] Whereas we are as broad as,
[993.10 → 995.10] okay, this week...
[995.10 → 997.84] Is this thing powered by something?
[998.22 → 1001.66] This week we uploaded a tour of ASML
[1001.66 → 1005.02] who makes the lithography machines
[1005.02 → 1011.60] that help manufacturers like Intel and TSMC
[1011.60 → 1014.18] produce the world's most cutting-edge microchips.
[1014.72 → 1017.78] So like super, super deep technical video.
[1018.28 → 1022.40] And then we also built a silly $100,000 computer
[1022.40 → 1023.48] for playing Minecraft.
[1023.86 → 1025.12] We water-cooled a bed.
[1025.12 → 1027.68] I basically did a YouTuber video
[1027.68 → 1029.50] where I talked about, you know,
[1029.54 → 1031.22] what's going on in my personal life,
[1031.28 → 1032.38] my job role change.
[1032.44 → 1034.48] Like, we are all over the map.
[1035.12 → 1036.72] Reviews of a couple GPUs.
[1037.16 → 1038.60] So the way that I see it,
[1038.62 → 1040.20] it's going to be much, much harder
[1040.20 → 1042.96] to attract a loyal audience to a channel
[1042.96 → 1045.74] and therefore build a loyal audience for a channel
[1045.74 → 1047.38] unless you're focused.
[1047.62 → 1048.76] And the way that I see it,
[1048.92 → 1050.86] if you have a power supply-focused channel,
[1051.00 → 1052.72] you're going to get two different viewers for that.
[1052.72 → 1054.84] You're going to get people who really want to stay up
[1054.84 → 1057.06] on what's going on in power supplies.
[1057.58 → 1059.48] And then you're going to get people
[1059.48 → 1062.84] who haven't cared about a power supply in six years,
[1063.00 → 1064.46] but they're building a new computer
[1064.46 → 1065.00] and they're going,
[1065.62 → 1068.26] sorry, 16-pin what?
[1069.40 → 1070.04] What's...
[1070.04 → 1071.60] I don't care.
[1071.66 → 1073.10] Just tell me a good one, right?
[1073.16 → 1074.22] So you're going to get a lot of those.
[1074.62 → 1075.56] Our goal,
[1075.80 → 1080.42] our goal for a power supply-specific channel will be,
[1080.42 → 1082.28] and you guys can quote me on this,
[1082.72 → 1085.54] to have a video for every power supply.
[1089.26 → 1090.56] Like every new one that comes out?
[1091.82 → 1092.90] Well, we're going to have to work on some...
[1092.90 → 1094.02] Are you including server ones?
[1094.04 → 1095.06] Some back catalogue too?
[1095.96 → 1096.24] No.
[1096.62 → 1096.90] Okay.
[1097.28 → 1098.32] No, like ATX.
[1098.66 → 1099.64] ATX power supply.
[1099.66 → 1100.70] It could be money-money in doing server ones.
[1100.92 → 1101.60] There could,
[1101.94 → 1102.84] but I mean,
[1102.90 → 1105.14] almost nobody builds a server anymore.
[1105.34 → 1106.04] Ah, yeah, fair enough.
[1106.04 → 1108.00] It's almost exclusively bare bones.
[1108.16 → 1112.10] And I could see us having a more enterprise IT
[1112.10 → 1115.22] sort of focused channel at some point.
[1115.22 → 1115.68] Stuff, but maybe not that.
[1115.76 → 1117.42] Where we would look at bare-bones servers
[1117.42 → 1120.28] and look at these platforms as a whole.
[1120.44 → 1122.44] But that would be something that would come later
[1122.44 → 1124.34] and it would be more along the lines of
[1124.34 → 1126.04] how we would test something like laptops.
[1126.04 → 1126.72] Laptops.
[1126.82 → 1127.32] Laptops.
[1127.98 → 1128.20] Right.
[1128.30 → 1128.98] Oh, man.
[1129.26 → 1131.18] Laptops are deep.
[1131.60 → 1133.62] To cover a laptop properly,
[1134.14 → 1137.54] you have to have your methodologies down for everything.
[1137.96 → 1138.98] Battery testing,
[1139.16 → 1139.92] screen testing,
[1140.38 → 1141.40] keyboard testing,
[1141.90 → 1143.28] processor testing.
[1143.58 → 1145.58] Oh, don't forget that you're going to have to account
[1145.58 → 1147.54] for different environmental factors.
[1148.00 → 1149.64] Don't forget that you need to test it
[1149.64 → 1151.16] in different power profiles,
[1151.28 → 1153.36] depending on whether it's plugged in or unplugged.
[1153.36 → 1155.42] Laptops are going to take some time.
[1155.72 → 1156.32] Oh, yeah, right.
[1156.52 → 1158.72] And don't forget that per model,
[1159.08 → 1159.80] per chassis,
[1159.92 → 1160.76] they're available in,
[1160.84 → 1161.26] I don't know,
[1161.34 → 1163.34] about 25 different configurations.
[1165.36 → 1168.54] Do you remember when I optimistically bought
[1168.54 → 1171.36] one of every config of the M1 MacBook?
[1171.74 → 1172.50] Thinking, okay,
[1172.64 → 1175.52] we're going to get our laptop methodology down
[1175.52 → 1177.90] and we're going to be the outlet
[1177.90 → 1179.70] that actually can tell you
[1179.70 → 1182.92] exactly which configuration to buy.
[1182.92 → 1183.80] Like bang for the buck
[1183.80 → 1185.92] and then they basically all got deployed
[1185.92 → 1187.44] to people who wanted MacBooks internally
[1187.44 → 1189.16] and scattered to the high winds.
[1189.60 → 1190.56] Yeah, that was a good investment.
[1193.94 → 1194.38] Anywho,
[1194.96 → 1196.82] the idea is that eventually
[1196.82 → 1198.34] we're going to get there
[1198.34 → 1199.30] and then all the ones
[1199.30 → 1200.58] that we don't need anymore,
[1200.72 → 1202.54] we'll just divest ourselves of
[1202.54 → 1204.64] by flipping them at LTTstore.com
[1204.64 → 1205.58] or on eBay or whatever.
[1205.70 → 1206.58] We'll figure all of that out.
[1209.00 → 1210.30] It's time for us to jump into
[1210.30 → 1211.32] our next topic here.
[1211.32 → 1213.48] Apparently Dan is not going to let me talk
[1213.48 → 1214.54] about haters anymore.
[1215.38 → 1215.66] Do you want,
[1215.82 → 1216.82] can we talk about this,
[1216.88 → 1217.74] this Sony thing?
[1218.38 → 1218.80] Yeah,
[1218.88 → 1220.28] Sony PS5 announcements.
[1220.68 → 1221.10] At the
[1221.28 → 1223.24] their PlayStation showcase,
[1223.50 → 1225.52] Sony announced their new handhelds,
[1225.52 → 1227.32] projected to come out later this year
[1227.32 → 1228.72] called Project Q.
[1229.24 → 1230.94] The handheld allows remote play
[1230.94 → 1233.26] of PS5 games via Wi-Fi
[1233.26 → 1235.46] at up to 1080p and 60 FPS.
[1235.78 → 1237.38] It has an eight-inch LCD screen.
[1237.70 → 1239.24] We have no idea how much it will cost
[1239.24 → 1241.82] and it's unclear whether it will do anything else
[1241.82 → 1243.62] other than stream PS5 games
[1243.62 → 1246.10] or whether it will be able to use cellular networks.
[1246.38 → 1247.80] Considering they specified Wi-Fi,
[1248.06 → 1249.22] I kind of doubt it,
[1249.32 → 1249.94] but we'll see.
[1250.16 → 1250.26] Yeah,
[1250.30 → 1251.24] that's one of those things
[1251.24 → 1253.30] where the answer is no.
[1253.70 → 1253.92] Yeah.
[1254.74 → 1255.22] Also,
[1255.46 → 1256.92] lossless wireless earbuds.
[1258.06 → 1258.36] Okay.
[1258.36 → 1261.08] The PlayStation showcase also highlighted
[1261.08 → 1262.32] a number of upcoming games.
[1262.66 → 1264.02] Sony announced slash showed off
[1264.02 → 1266.18] several standard PS5 games.
[1266.48 → 1269.30] The only notable exclusive being Spider-Man 2.
[1270.08 → 1270.64] Okay.
[1270.94 → 1272.42] Some notable non-exclusives,
[1272.66 → 1274.46] a remake of Metal Gear 3,
[1274.76 → 1276.82] a reboot of Bungee's Marathon series.
[1277.50 → 1278.10] That's...
[1278.10 → 1278.60] I know,
[1278.68 → 1278.92] right?
[1279.38 → 1282.82] Sony owning Bungee just makes my brain hurt.
[1282.96 → 1283.20] Yeah,
[1283.20 → 1284.16] but it's non-exclusive.
[1285.92 → 1286.78] Which is also,
[1286.90 → 1288.00] the whole thing is just like,
[1288.00 → 1289.08] it's weird,
[1289.16 → 1290.10] but maybe really cool.
[1290.28 → 1291.50] I haven't been able to look into
[1291.50 → 1292.92] any of that yet
[1292.92 → 1293.90] because I had a very busy week,
[1293.98 → 1295.58] but I'm pretty interested
[1295.58 → 1297.66] in the idea of them rebooting Marathon.
[1297.80 → 1298.10] We'll see.
[1298.62 → 1299.70] Alan Wake 2,
[1300.06 → 1301.06] a Platoon alike
[1301.06 → 1302.48] called Foam Stars,
[1302.96 → 1305.04] and the one Riley is most excited about,
[1305.26 → 1306.60] the Talos Principle 2.
[1306.92 → 1307.84] I think quite a few people
[1307.84 → 1309.02] are going to be excited about that.
[1309.22 → 1310.76] It's a PVP extraction shooter.
[1313.90 → 1314.34] Oh.
[1314.84 → 1316.46] I think you've got his attention.
[1316.60 → 1317.18] Oh my.
[1317.18 → 1317.24] Okay.
[1317.46 → 1319.46] Bungee making a PVP extraction shooter
[1319.46 → 1321.16] is extremely exciting.
[1321.90 → 1322.62] Like the Division.
[1322.78 → 1322.94] Okay.
[1323.06 → 1323.66] That part,
[1324.20 → 1325.60] makes it a lot worse.
[1325.78 → 1326.04] Okay.
[1326.14 → 1327.78] Hopefully it's not like the Division at all.
[1328.34 → 1329.84] The Division was terrible,
[1330.06 → 1330.60] in my opinion,
[1330.82 → 1332.70] but I'm sure someone liked it.
[1332.82 → 1333.00] Okay.
[1333.24 → 1334.74] I want to talk about this
[1334.74 → 1336.70] wireless console thing.
[1337.28 → 1338.48] Is it just me?
[1339.78 → 1340.18] Or?
[1340.18 → 1342.42] Like very little use for this?
[1344.06 → 1345.60] Why don't you just play on your TV?
[1345.78 → 1347.88] I don't know how to feel about this.
[1347.92 → 1348.10] Okay.
[1348.18 → 1348.84] So first,
[1348.92 → 1349.06] here,
[1349.14 → 1350.28] let's flip over to my laptop.
[1350.52 → 1351.02] This is,
[1351.02 → 1352.80] this is apparently what it's going to look like.
[1353.50 → 1354.78] I think it looks cool.
[1355.82 → 1356.22] Yeah.
[1356.34 → 1357.02] It looks really cool.
[1357.02 → 1357.56] It actually looks like
[1357.56 → 1358.84] it's probably comfortable to hold
[1358.84 → 1359.48] and stuff too.
[1359.48 → 1359.76] Okay.
[1359.78 → 1360.52] Here's my problem.
[1360.76 → 1363.02] I don't know how to feel about this
[1363.02 → 1365.38] because I've been kind of all over the place.
[1365.66 → 1365.84] Yeah.
[1366.18 → 1368.90] I loved the Nvidia Shield.
[1369.36 → 1369.66] Yes.
[1369.74 → 1370.24] And yes,
[1370.44 → 1372.48] Android games did exist
[1372.48 → 1373.88] that could be played with a controller,
[1374.10 → 1375.12] but at the time,
[1375.24 → 1376.74] they were way less common.
[1377.10 → 1379.32] So it was fundamentally
[1379.32 → 1381.42] only a device
[1381.42 → 1383.04] for streaming your gaming PC
[1383.04 → 1385.16] to a handheld form factor.
[1385.46 → 1388.50] And I was crazy in love with that thing.
[1388.62 → 1388.80] It was,
[1388.80 → 1390.60] it was how I played games
[1390.60 → 1392.24] when I had infant children
[1392.24 → 1394.28] because you basically had the kid
[1394.28 → 1396.14] kind of in the thing in your arms
[1396.14 → 1397.26] and you could play video games.
[1397.32 → 1398.80] There was no way you considered a computer.
[1398.90 → 1399.38] So that was it.
[1399.44 → 1400.66] That was how I could play video games.
[1401.24 → 1402.00] Loved that.
[1402.42 → 1403.20] And then,
[1403.36 → 1404.42] you know,
[1404.46 → 1406.28] I was less bullish on the Steam link,
[1406.42 → 1408.52] which is basically the same idea,
[1408.64 → 1410.06] except that it allows you to play
[1410.06 → 1412.92] your gaming PC games on your TV
[1412.92 → 1414.52] with a Steam controller
[1414.52 → 1415.48] or some other controller
[1415.48 → 1416.18] or whatever else.
[1416.52 → 1418.56] And then I'm trying to think of,
[1418.56 → 1419.64] kind of what came,
[1419.72 → 1420.50] what came next here.
[1420.56 → 1422.80] I never really used the NVIDIA Shield console
[1422.80 → 1423.56] for that,
[1423.64 → 1424.22] for that function.
[1424.32 → 1426.50] It just didn't really appeal to me.
[1426.74 → 1428.50] And then when Logitech,
[1428.80 → 1429.12] okay,
[1429.68 → 1432.00] when Logitech announced the G Cloud,
[1432.28 → 1433.24] I was looking at it going,
[1433.30 → 1433.36] well,
[1433.36 → 1434.88] this is just kind of stupid
[1434.88 → 1437.28] because you could get a Steam Deck
[1437.28 → 1439.40] for like $100 more
[1439.40 → 1441.42] that actually has a full computer in it.
[1441.42 → 1443.48] but then I reviewed the G Cloud
[1443.48 → 1444.96] and even though I was
[1444.96 → 1446.80] a certified hater of the thing,
[1447.50 → 1449.08] I actually really liked it.
[1449.66 → 1449.78] Like,
[1449.82 → 1450.82] I really liked it.
[1450.92 → 1451.90] I've got nothing against
[1451.90 → 1452.98] the concept of this.
[1453.08 → 1454.08] I'm a little bit concerned
[1454.08 → 1455.12] about what I expect
[1455.12 → 1455.96] the price might be.
[1456.08 → 1456.94] then there's the Wii U.
[1457.30 → 1458.18] Did you ever use
[1458.18 → 1460.00] the wireless controller pad
[1460.00 → 1461.12] function of the Wii U?
[1461.18 → 1462.76] Did you ever even look at that screen?
[1462.92 → 1463.12] Yeah.
[1463.66 → 1463.96] Really?
[1464.08 → 1469.10] I am a rare Pikachu Wii U enjoyer.
[1469.54 → 1470.94] I really liked the Wii U.
[1471.36 → 1471.66] I was,
[1471.74 → 1472.78] I actually genuinely
[1472.78 → 1474.22] very much liked the Wii U.
[1474.54 → 1475.24] We found one.
[1475.78 → 1476.28] I even loved,
[1476.38 → 1476.62] okay,
[1476.84 → 1478.34] so the Super Mario Bros,
[1478.56 → 1479.32] whatever it was,
[1479.42 → 1481.68] that came out for the Wii U.
[1481.76 → 1483.32] New Super Mario Bros Wii U.
[1483.32 → 1485.46] It had a four-player co-op feature.
[1485.68 → 1486.02] I guess it did.
[1486.34 → 1488.68] With a fifth person
[1488.68 → 1491.92] that used that main controller,
[1492.18 → 1493.46] had their own screen,
[1493.46 → 1494.74] and you could put down
[1494.74 → 1496.00] like emergency platforms
[1496.00 → 1496.76] for your teammates.
[1497.02 → 1498.68] You could also troll them
[1498.68 → 1500.14] by while they're like mid-jump,
[1500.22 → 1501.42] put a platform right in front of them
[1501.42 → 1502.26] and they smack into it
[1502.26 → 1502.74] and fall down.
[1502.92 → 1503.84] You could like try to fight
[1503.84 → 1504.54] your own team
[1504.54 → 1506.12] from actually completing the level
[1506.12 → 1506.68] and all this kind of stuff.
[1507.72 → 1508.46] Extremely fun.
[1509.40 → 1510.06] That's fair.
[1510.20 → 1510.54] Very fun.
[1510.64 → 1511.12] That's fair.
[1511.12 → 1512.60] Unique experience too.
[1513.02 → 1513.62] That's fair.
[1513.68 → 1514.44] And very fun.
[1514.74 → 1516.08] I played a bunch of different games
[1516.08 → 1516.48] on the Wii U.
[1516.54 → 1517.22] They're all perfect.
[1517.46 → 1518.62] I am deeply convinced
[1518.62 → 1519.46] that the only reason
[1519.46 → 1520.60] why the Wii U didn't do well
[1520.60 → 1522.90] was because no one knew
[1522.90 → 1525.18] that A, it existed,
[1525.58 → 1527.22] or B, what the hell it even was.
[1527.86 → 1530.18] My group of relatively techie friends,
[1530.32 → 1531.28] when I first bought it,
[1531.32 → 1532.04] I invited them all over
[1532.04 → 1533.08] because I wanted to play
[1533.08 → 1535.96] the five-person Super Mario Bros. thing.
[1536.50 → 1537.58] Or, yeah, Super Mario Bros.
[1537.62 → 1537.78] Yeah.
[1539.00 → 1539.80] All of them,
[1540.76 → 1541.74] literally all of them,
[1542.08 → 1542.84] thought that I bought
[1542.84 → 1544.18] some expansion for my Wii.
[1545.18 → 1546.10] None of them knew
[1546.10 → 1546.96] that it was a dedicated console.
[1546.96 → 1547.58] Swedish made?
[1547.58 → 1549.80] What did I say?
[1550.30 → 1551.02] Did I say something wrong?
[1551.46 → 1552.10] No, no, you just,
[1552.28 → 1553.42] an expansion for your Wii?
[1553.80 → 1555.14] I'm asking if its Swedish made.
[1558.54 → 1559.54] But yeah, I don't know.
[1559.66 → 1561.38] I really enjoyed the Wii U.
[1561.52 → 1562.42] And that controller,
[1562.76 → 1563.54] one, is very...
[1563.54 → 1565.10] That sort of thing is his bag, baby.
[1565.10 → 1572.24] That controller was actually
[1572.24 → 1573.08] very comfortable.
[1573.24 → 1573.82] That's true.
[1574.18 → 1574.38] Yeah.
[1574.48 → 1575.16] Yep, it's true.
[1575.50 → 1576.50] Like, more comfortable
[1576.50 → 1577.84] than the Switch is by a lot,
[1577.92 → 1578.54] in my opinion.
[1578.72 → 1579.04] Okay.
[1579.36 → 1580.66] I do want to keep talking
[1580.66 → 1582.08] about this paradigm, though,
[1582.18 → 1584.72] because I had another opportunity
[1584.72 → 1586.18] to look at a device
[1586.18 → 1587.74] that's basically this,
[1587.74 → 1589.92] and I have to confess,
[1590.98 → 1592.34] I kind of blew them off
[1592.34 → 1593.88] because I just
[1593.88 → 1595.68] didn't really care.
[1597.30 → 1599.18] So you always expect it to suck
[1599.18 → 1600.08] and then it's actually okay.
[1600.30 → 1601.38] Well, no, it's not that
[1601.38 → 1602.60] because I was so jazzed
[1602.60 → 1603.70] on the shield, right?
[1603.86 → 1604.94] So here, hold on a second.
[1605.02 → 1606.14] I'm just going to jump back over
[1606.14 → 1607.34] to my laptop for a second here.
[1607.74 → 1609.26] This is from Peak do,
[1609.34 → 1609.98] of all people.
[1610.56 → 1611.86] Remember these guys?
[1611.96 → 1613.02] They had this, like,
[1613.08 → 1613.78] low latency
[1613.78 → 1617.14] HDMI streaming thing
[1617.14 → 1619.16] so it's millimetre wave,
[1619.50 → 1621.24] which is a problem
[1621.24 → 1622.30] because that means
[1622.30 → 1623.40] the range is going to be
[1623.40 → 1624.20] pretty foobar,
[1624.34 → 1625.38] but 1080p,
[1625.50 → 1626.00] 1080p,
[1626.66 → 1627.40] so 60 hertz,
[1627.90 → 1631.60] and the pitched sort of,
[1631.60 → 1633.04] the pitched sort of use case
[1633.04 → 1633.74] for this thing
[1633.74 → 1635.74] was actually streaming
[1635.74 → 1637.46] your PlayStation 5 to it.
[1637.84 → 1638.94] Compatible with PC,
[1639.10 → 1639.82] PlayStation, Xbox,
[1640.02 → 1641.46] Windows, Switch, etc.
[1641.76 → 1643.44] Two and a half milliseconds delay
[1643.44 → 1645.38] up to 30 meters or whatever
[1645.38 → 1647.14] and three-hour battery life.
[1647.48 → 1648.78] And I kind of looked at this
[1648.78 → 1649.22] and I went,
[1650.54 → 1654.22] that seems really niche.
[1656.22 → 1659.10] And Sony just laid down
[1659.10 → 1660.96] a big fat,
[1661.52 → 1663.62] I think you're wrong, Linus.
[1663.84 → 1664.10] Yeah.
[1664.10 → 1665.36] Because they are releasing
[1665.36 → 1667.16] a first party accessory
[1667.16 → 1669.56] that's just this.
[1672.56 → 1673.72] If this thing could work
[1673.72 → 1674.48] over cell networks,
[1674.58 → 1675.20] it would be sick.
[1675.62 → 1676.12] It doesn't.
[1676.58 → 1677.46] I know it doesn't.
[1677.50 → 1678.40] You don't want,
[1678.54 → 1678.68] see,
[1678.80 → 1680.42] people keep asking for this.
[1680.98 → 1682.32] You don't want to game
[1682.32 → 1683.36] over a cellular network.
[1683.44 → 1683.94] Yeah, fair enough.
[1684.16 → 1684.38] Yeah, yeah.
[1684.48 → 1684.76] And,
[1685.14 → 1685.92] okay,
[1686.12 → 1687.20] I know.
[1687.20 → 1688.38] Some games would be totally fine.
[1688.38 → 1689.38] I hear you.
[1689.46 → 1689.90] Someone would be totally fine.
[1689.90 → 1691.10] I can actually hear
[1691.10 → 1692.90] your keys heating up
[1692.90 → 1694.92] as you furiously type a message
[1694.92 → 1696.62] about how much you love
[1696.62 → 1697.64] using Moonlight
[1697.64 → 1699.46] over a cell network
[1699.46 → 1699.94] or whatever.
[1700.44 → 1700.94] Steam Link.
[1702.02 → 1702.96] I know.
[1703.30 → 1705.24] There are certain types of games.
[1705.30 → 1705.90] You want to play like
[1705.90 → 1707.14] a puzzle game or something.
[1707.32 → 1707.72] Civ.
[1707.88 → 1708.92] No problem.
[1709.10 → 1709.82] By all means.
[1709.94 → 1711.16] Play over a cellular network.
[1711.64 → 1712.88] But wherever you live,
[1713.04 → 1713.26] A,
[1713.40 → 1714.32] your cell network
[1714.32 → 1716.08] must be a lot better than mine.
[1716.24 → 1717.16] So maybe you're in like
[1717.16 → 1718.32] Tokyo
[1718.32 → 1719.32] or you're in like
[1719.32 → 1719.78] Seoul
[1719.78 → 1720.94] or something like that.
[1721.22 → 1722.22] Sure, fine.
[1722.62 → 1722.86] A,
[1722.96 → 1723.62] your cell network
[1723.62 → 1724.72] is a lot better than mine.
[1725.08 → 1725.52] B,
[1726.02 → 1726.78] you must have
[1726.78 → 1728.84] a really great data plan.
[1729.06 → 1729.92] Both of those things
[1729.92 → 1730.54] are true
[1730.54 → 1731.30] in a lot of places
[1731.30 → 1731.70] in the world.
[1731.98 → 1732.18] Absolutely.
[1732.18 → 1732.84] People run their house
[1732.84 → 1733.68] Internets off cell.
[1734.14 → 1734.58] Absolutely.
[1735.92 → 1736.36] However,
[1736.86 → 1737.70] even under those
[1737.70 → 1738.50] ideal conditions,
[1738.64 → 1739.40] there are certain genres
[1739.40 → 1740.34] of games that are just
[1740.34 → 1741.58] not going to be fun
[1741.58 → 1742.54] with the additional latency.
[1743.46 → 1744.58] And I just,
[1744.72 → 1745.58] I wouldn't,
[1745.70 → 1747.02] I wouldn't compromise.
[1747.16 → 1747.48] On that.
[1747.56 → 1748.14] I just wouldn't.
[1749.10 → 1750.90] I love what Sony's
[1750.90 → 1751.72] doing right now though.
[1752.56 → 1754.42] PSVR 2 is awesome.
[1754.70 → 1754.80] Yeah.
[1755.56 → 1756.00] This,
[1756.68 → 1758.10] I don't know if it's awesome.
[1758.22 → 1758.80] It looks cool.
[1758.88 → 1759.62] But it's cool.
[1759.82 → 1760.02] Yeah.
[1760.26 → 1761.08] It's different.
[1761.26 → 1761.42] Yeah.
[1761.68 → 1762.30] It's not just.
[1762.44 → 1763.54] I am 100% certain,
[1763.90 → 1764.78] while it's not necessarily
[1764.78 → 1765.28] for me,
[1765.58 → 1766.22] that some people
[1766.22 → 1767.02] will love this thing.
[1767.26 → 1767.92] Like Microsoft,
[1768.64 → 1771.62] how hard have they lost
[1771.62 → 1772.82] this generation of gaming
[1772.82 → 1773.50] at this point?
[1773.98 → 1774.26] You,
[1774.42 → 1774.80] you,
[1775.18 → 1775.62] could play
[1775.62 → 1776.44] PlayStation games
[1776.44 → 1776.88] in the bath.
[1777.82 → 1778.14] Yeah.
[1779.34 → 1780.08] I could.
[1780.34 → 1780.98] That's pretty sweet.
[1781.08 → 1781.54] I won't,
[1781.72 → 1782.18] but I could.
[1782.32 → 1782.34] Yeah,
[1782.34 → 1783.74] because not necessarily
[1783.74 → 1784.42] 100% for you,
[1784.54 → 1786.48] but someone could fit
[1786.48 → 1787.12] that use case.
[1787.78 → 1788.32] That's pretty cool.
[1788.72 → 1789.30] I do,
[1789.36 → 1790.34] I do wonder,
[1790.72 → 1791.90] and Conrad's echoing this
[1791.90 → 1793.02] in the chat,
[1793.54 → 1795.50] how much is it going to cost?
[1795.50 → 1797.18] Them not announcing a price
[1797.18 → 1798.16] is like a little SUS.
[1798.16 → 1800.54] It is,
[1800.54 → 1800.92] it is a
[1800.92 → 1801.58] it is a wee,
[1801.78 → 1802.70] wee bit SUS.
[1803.58 → 1804.96] I think it's not,
[1805.00 → 1805.78] I think it's not going
[1805.78 → 1806.26] to be cheap.
[1806.36 → 1806.54] I mean,
[1806.62 → 1806.80] here,
[1806.96 → 1807.14] here,
[1807.22 → 1807.64] you know what?
[1807.92 → 1809.26] I can get you pricing
[1809.26 → 1810.66] for that Peak Doe thing
[1810.66 → 1811.54] because realistically,
[1811.54 → 1812.36] it's the same,
[1812.42 → 1813.22] same hardware.
[1815.04 → 1815.82] You know what?
[1815.86 → 1816.98] I don't know if I ever
[1816.98 → 1817.94] got a final price
[1817.94 → 1818.54] because I think it was
[1818.54 → 1819.60] a Kickstarter or something.
[1819.72 → 1819.86] Right,
[1819.92 → 1820.62] that was one of the other
[1820.62 → 1821.38] reasons that we didn't
[1821.38 → 1821.74] cover it.
[1821.82 → 1822.02] I don't,
[1822.12 → 1824.34] I don't like covering
[1824.34 → 1825.02] Kickstarter's.
[1825.16 → 1825.90] Speaking of which,
[1825.92 → 1826.64] we should talk about
[1826.64 → 1828.28] that sponsor spot fail
[1828.28 → 1829.66] this week on Tech Wiki.
[1829.84 → 1830.06] I'll,
[1830.32 → 1831.02] we'll address that
[1831.02 → 1831.44] a little bit later.
[1831.48 → 1832.12] Don't let me forget.
[1833.28 → 1833.64] No,
[1833.80 → 1834.66] I don't have a
[1834.66 → 1835.28] I don't have a price
[1835.28 → 1835.94] for this thing.
[1836.04 → 1837.34] So if I had to guess,
[1837.40 → 1838.06] I'd say it'll probably
[1838.06 → 1839.16] be similar to the G Cloud.
[1839.50 → 1840.70] So in the 250,
[1840.94 → 1842.88] 250 US to 299,
[1843.04 → 1843.70] I think this is going
[1843.70 → 1844.76] to be a very expensive
[1844.76 → 1845.24] accessory.
[1845.44 → 1846.26] But again,
[1846.26 → 1847.14] I do think some people
[1847.14 → 1847.66] will eat that.
[1847.78 → 1848.52] But that's something
[1848.52 → 1850.48] that Sony has demonstrated
[1850.48 → 1852.16] that they're totally
[1852.16 → 1852.96] willing to do.
[1853.48 → 1854.08] I mean,
[1854.12 → 1855.58] the PlayStation VR 2
[1855.58 → 1856.34] is an accessory
[1856.34 → 1857.20] that costs as much
[1857.20 → 1858.22] as the bloody console.
[1858.36 → 1858.48] Yeah.
[1859.12 → 1859.42] Like,
[1859.60 → 1860.12] okay.
[1860.36 → 1860.68] It's not,
[1860.82 → 1862.00] that's not cheap
[1862.00 → 1864.04] by any means
[1864.04 → 1865.06] at all.
[1865.52 → 1866.36] But like,
[1866.96 → 1868.76] it's not,
[1868.80 → 1870.42] it's not 700 bucks.
[1870.64 → 1871.80] It's not dedicated
[1871.80 → 1872.54] handheld price.
[1872.54 → 1872.60] Yeah,
[1872.68 → 1873.04] you're not,
[1873.04 → 1874.38] you're not buying,
[1874.62 → 1875.22] you're not,
[1875.26 → 1876.30] you're not buying
[1876.30 → 1876.90] an accessory.
[1876.90 → 1878.36] You're buying a completely
[1878.36 → 1879.94] different experience.
[1880.26 → 1880.44] Yeah.
[1880.64 → 1881.28] And yeah,
[1881.28 → 1881.98] that's something that
[1881.98 → 1882.68] Sony has done
[1882.68 → 1884.16] a perfect job
[1884.16 → 1884.64] of here
[1884.64 → 1885.88] is creating
[1885.88 → 1886.94] different experiences
[1886.94 → 1888.08] and it's not going
[1888.08 → 1888.76] to have quite
[1888.76 → 1889.32] the mobility
[1889.32 → 1890.12] of the switch.
[1890.76 → 1890.94] But,
[1891.26 → 1893.38] man,
[1893.46 → 1893.78] I have to,
[1894.30 → 1895.62] gotta take a moment
[1895.62 → 1897.04] and just appreciate
[1897.04 → 1898.38] how crap the switch
[1898.38 → 1899.10] is these days.
[1899.10 → 1901.46] I own a switch OLED,
[1901.96 → 1903.40] a top of the line
[1903.40 → 1904.10] It's old now.
[1904.20 → 1904.66] switch,
[1904.80 → 1905.54] if you will.
[1905.94 → 1907.62] And I own
[1907.62 → 1908.54] Tears of the Kingdom.
[1908.70 → 1910.18] You guys saw my copy
[1910.18 → 1911.36] that I bought
[1911.36 → 1912.62] on the short circuit
[1912.62 → 1914.30] and I am currently
[1914.30 → 1915.08] in the process
[1915.08 → 1917.56] of getting my,
[1917.56 → 1918.66] my You
[1918.66 → 1919.64] all set up
[1919.64 → 1920.34] for the trip
[1920.34 → 1920.94] that Luke and I
[1920.94 → 1921.64] are going on
[1921.64 → 1922.62] so that I can start
[1922.62 → 1923.32] Tears of the Kingdom
[1923.32 → 1924.14] on a platform
[1924.14 → 1925.18] that doesn't suck.
[1925.84 → 1925.94] Yeah.
[1926.28 → 1926.72] Yeah,
[1926.78 → 1927.76] the switch is over
[1927.76 → 1928.56] six years old.
[1929.14 → 1929.30] Yeah,
[1929.32 → 1929.96] and it was garbage
[1929.96 → 1930.70] when it came out.
[1930.80 → 1931.56] That's the worst part.
[1931.80 → 1932.18] By the way,
[1932.46 → 1933.72] Jake from the lab
[1933.72 → 1935.16] is talking
[1935.16 → 1936.28] in the float plane chat
[1936.28 → 1937.28] about what I said
[1937.28 → 1938.70] about cellular networks
[1938.70 → 1939.92] and game streaming
[1939.92 → 1940.70] and he's like,
[1940.74 → 1940.82] yeah,
[1940.84 → 1941.58] the problem is not
[1941.58 → 1942.64] how many gigabits
[1942.64 → 1943.70] per second or whatever
[1943.70 → 1944.46] you can get
[1944.46 → 1945.26] in a speed test.
[1945.58 → 1946.20] The problem is that
[1946.20 → 1947.46] this is real-time data
[1947.46 → 1948.78] and latency matters
[1948.78 → 1950.56] and so if anything arrives
[1950.56 → 1951.74] even ever so slightly
[1951.74 → 1952.38] out of order,
[1952.48 → 1953.28] it's going to be garbled
[1953.28 → 1954.22] and that's something
[1954.22 → 1956.04] you simply can't control
[1956.04 → 1957.36] on a cellular network.
[1957.36 → 1958.82] It's extremely challenging
[1958.82 → 1961.78] and yeah,
[1961.90 → 1962.52] people are talking
[1962.52 → 1962.88] about like
[1962.88 → 1964.10] what ping time I get
[1964.10 → 1965.42] or how many megabits
[1965.42 → 1965.66] I get.
[1965.76 → 1967.28] That is not the point.
[1967.84 → 1969.02] It's just a very,
[1969.20 → 1969.48] very,
[1969.82 → 1970.60] even though it feels
[1970.60 → 1971.48] the same to us.
[1971.52 → 1972.02] It's the same thing
[1972.02 → 1973.00] with frame times, right?
[1973.10 → 1973.24] Yeah,
[1973.28 → 1973.98] I click link
[1973.98 → 1975.10] and page load.
[1975.48 → 1976.78] It feels the same to us
[1976.78 → 1977.82] but it's a really
[1977.82 → 1978.86] different technology.
[1978.86 → 1982.62] Yep, yep, yep.
[1982.78 → 1983.06] Alright,
[1983.26 → 1983.94] it's time for us
[1983.94 → 1985.62] to explain merch messages.
[1985.96 → 1986.80] If you want to send
[1986.80 → 1988.06] a message into the show,
[1988.14 → 1989.02] the way to do it
[1989.02 → 1990.30] is with the merch message.
[1990.40 → 1990.84] Hey, look,
[1991.38 → 1993.16] G or G just scored
[1993.16 → 1994.40] an insulated water bottle,
[1994.66 → 1995.50] 64 ounce,
[1995.56 → 1996.54] at lttstore.com.
[1997.08 → 1997.94] When you're in the checkout,
[1998.36 → 1999.18] you can send,
[1999.46 → 2001.02] when you're in the cart,
[2001.50 → 2002.96] you can send a merch message
[2002.96 → 2003.92] and our producer,
[2004.10 → 2004.34] Dan,
[2004.40 → 2006.12] will try to respond to it.
[2006.18 → 2006.66] It's going to be a bit
[2006.66 → 2007.64] of a shorter show today
[2007.64 → 2008.24] because Luke and I
[2008.24 → 2009.04] have to catch a flight.
[2009.14 → 2009.74] We'll talk about that
[2009.74 → 2010.30] in a little bit.
[2011.02 → 2012.12] And so our producer,
[2012.26 → 2012.40] Dan,
[2012.44 → 2013.32] might respond to it.
[2013.38 → 2014.56] He might just put it up
[2014.56 → 2015.12] on the bottom
[2015.12 → 2016.88] and if there are no replies,
[2017.08 → 2018.86] who knows?
[2018.96 → 2020.38] Maybe chat can help
[2020.38 → 2021.72] reply to your merch message.
[2021.82 → 2022.54] We might need some help
[2022.54 → 2023.86] from you guys today.
[2024.46 → 2025.88] Or Dan is going to curate
[2025.88 → 2027.32] some of them for me
[2027.32 → 2028.48] and Luke to address
[2028.48 → 2029.70] later on during
[2029.70 → 2031.34] WAN Show After Dark.
[2031.54 → 2032.68] Since we're talking about
[2032.68 → 2033.42] what's going on
[2033.42 → 2034.06] on the store,
[2034.20 → 2035.32] why don't we tell you guys
[2035.32 → 2036.52] about a couple of new
[2036.52 → 2037.24] items?
[2038.70 → 2039.62] I don't see them
[2039.62 → 2040.42] in the thing here.
[2041.28 → 2041.60] Yes,
[2041.78 → 2042.72] I do see them
[2042.72 → 2043.40] in the thing here.
[2043.72 → 2044.78] We just launched
[2044.78 → 2047.12] our premium joggers.
[2047.34 → 2048.16] Who is this
[2048.16 → 2048.92] with that drip?
[2049.94 → 2050.56] It's got to be like
[2050.56 → 2051.42] Bellman or something.
[2051.56 → 2051.74] Oh, no.
[2052.30 → 2053.08] Whoever it is,
[2053.24 → 2054.88] they've got the swag stance
[2054.88 → 2055.38] going on.
[2055.58 → 2057.40] Definitely got the swag stance.
[2059.50 → 2060.84] These are super nice,
[2060.90 → 2061.36] by the way.
[2062.00 → 2062.58] Got them in two
[2062.58 → 2063.56] different colours.
[2063.68 → 2064.14] I might actually
[2064.14 → 2064.98] have to check these out.
[2065.12 → 2065.92] Black and olive.
[2067.34 → 2068.40] Man, love this.
[2068.56 → 2069.20] Great pose.
[2069.72 → 2071.14] I do want some joggers.
[2071.48 → 2071.84] Sammy!
[2072.98 → 2073.70] There's Sammy.
[2073.90 → 2075.12] He gets the poses, man.
[2075.32 → 2076.06] Yeah, Colton.
[2076.34 → 2076.96] He tries.
[2077.04 → 2077.60] Colton doesn't.
[2078.98 → 2080.82] We've got contrast going on.
[2082.12 → 2083.20] Solid effort.
[2083.20 → 2084.04] We've got a lot of
[2084.04 → 2084.20] things.
[2084.20 → 2085.56] Yeah, fantastic.
[2085.76 → 2087.28] These are super nice.
[2087.48 → 2088.64] Oh, look at this.
[2088.72 → 2089.60] What a nice write-up.
[2089.70 → 2090.40] You know how we've talked
[2090.40 → 2091.90] about how we don't do
[2091.90 → 2093.34] a good enough job sometimes?
[2093.62 → 2094.34] Hey, let's go.
[2094.42 → 2095.52] Made of 100%
[2095.52 → 2096.94] recycled polyester.
[2097.78 → 2098.10] Sick!
[2098.86 → 2099.28] Very cool.
[2099.40 → 2100.44] We also launched
[2100.44 → 2101.78] one other product
[2101.78 → 2102.32] this week
[2102.32 → 2102.80] that you guys
[2102.80 → 2103.32] are going to want
[2103.32 → 2104.22] to check out.
[2104.22 → 2106.04] I wouldn't necessarily
[2106.04 → 2107.34] wear these two together,
[2107.64 → 2108.66] but, you know,
[2108.74 → 2109.68] hey, you can definitely
[2109.68 → 2110.48] get them both.
[2111.18 → 2112.22] Very different feel.
[2112.54 → 2112.68] Yeah.
[2113.14 → 2114.50] But we've had a lot
[2114.50 → 2115.78] of people ask us
[2115.78 → 2116.64] for stuff that they
[2116.64 → 2117.38] can wear to work
[2117.38 → 2119.24] that still matches
[2119.24 → 2119.96] the comfort
[2119.96 → 2121.34] that they know
[2121.34 → 2121.80] and love
[2121.80 → 2122.74] from our other products,
[2122.74 → 2123.40] but that is
[2123.40 → 2124.10] workplace.
[2124.42 → 2125.04] Workplace ready?
[2125.36 → 2125.68] Colton?
[2127.92 → 2128.70] F***ING really?
[2128.94 → 2130.22] I swear I've seen him
[2130.22 → 2131.32] do exactly that.
[2131.40 → 2132.14] I don't know why,
[2132.78 → 2133.78] but, like,
[2134.00 → 2135.22] I've seen him do that.
[2135.52 → 2136.24] Why does Colton
[2136.24 → 2137.12] do anything he does?
[2137.16 → 2137.84] I don't know.
[2137.88 → 2138.64] Anyway, it's available
[2138.64 → 2139.62] in green
[2139.62 → 2142.20] and charcoal mélange.
[2142.84 → 2143.76] Super comfy.
[2144.50 → 2144.82] And,
[2145.06 → 2146.90] okay, who wrote these?
[2147.24 → 2148.12] This shirt is softer
[2148.12 → 2148.92] than a freshly
[2148.92 → 2150.98] pixelated kitten's fur.
[2151.74 → 2152.14] Okay.
[2153.74 → 2154.30] What?
[2155.06 → 2155.98] Pixelated kittens.
[2156.06 → 2156.78] What does that even mean?
[2156.88 → 2158.20] I have no idea,
[2158.38 → 2159.26] but it is,
[2159.34 → 2160.32] it is comfy.
[2161.84 → 2162.82] It's interesting.
[2163.08 → 2164.18] It probably would get
[2164.18 → 2164.98] people to keep reading,
[2165.14 → 2165.98] so maybe it's good.
[2166.38 → 2167.56] The joggers are available
[2167.56 → 2168.38] in two colours
[2168.38 → 2169.62] and two lengths.
[2170.54 → 2171.64] And the polo shirt
[2171.64 → 2172.10] is available
[2172.10 → 2173.60] in two different colours.
[2173.82 → 2174.06] Oh!
[2174.42 → 2175.60] Now seems like
[2175.60 → 2176.90] as good a time as any
[2176.90 → 2178.20] to talk about
[2178.20 → 2180.34] LTT is hiring.
[2180.92 → 2181.40] Ah, yes.
[2181.40 → 2182.06] Wait, I'm supposed
[2182.06 → 2183.62] to show the jobs page
[2183.62 → 2185.50] and I am also supposed
[2185.50 → 2185.98] to do the reading.
[2186.10 → 2186.70] You'll do the reading.
[2186.70 → 2187.62] Okay, I'll show
[2187.62 → 2188.48] the jobs page.
[2188.92 → 2190.06] Bullet point one,
[2190.30 → 2192.10] writer slash video producer,
[2192.34 → 2192.68] colon.
[2192.68 → 2192.96] Really, Luke?
[2192.96 → 2195.82] We're specifically looking
[2195.82 → 2196.60] for someone to help
[2196.60 → 2198.12] make the kind of videos
[2198.12 → 2198.92] Alex makes,
[2199.14 → 2199.42] i.e.
[2199.42 → 2200.02] we're looking for
[2200.02 → 2201.02] laptop expertise
[2201.02 → 2203.14] and or maker skills.
[2203.46 → 2204.08] Engineering background
[2204.08 → 2204.72] with expertise
[2204.72 → 2205.64] in SolidWorks,
[2205.90 → 2207.02] has to be SolidWorks
[2207.02 → 2207.52] specifically,
[2207.52 → 2209.64] would be a really nice
[2209.64 → 2210.46] bonus as well.
[2210.46 → 2211.46] Also, we're looking
[2211.46 → 2212.92] for a data visualization
[2212.92 → 2214.50] specialist for the labs.
[2214.84 → 2215.22] Basically,
[2215.42 → 2216.46] make our graphs better.
[2216.86 → 2218.64] This person should have
[2218.64 → 2221.00] great data presentation expertise,
[2221.56 → 2223.18] some ability as a graphic artist,
[2223.34 → 2224.20] and some ability
[2224.20 → 2225.74] as a data analyst.
[2226.42 → 2227.44] Mr. Gary Key
[2227.44 → 2228.62] has written a message
[2228.62 → 2229.74] to our potential hires
[2229.74 → 2230.20] as well.
[2231.20 → 2231.76] Oh?
[2231.92 → 2232.90] For everyone to enjoy.
[2233.28 → 2234.58] It's down on the bottom.
[2235.92 → 2236.70] Of what?
[2236.74 → 2237.48] Do you want to just read it
[2237.48 → 2237.90] at this point?
[2237.90 → 2238.18] Oh.
[2239.06 → 2239.58] I was looking at
[2239.58 → 2240.18] the wrong screen.
[2240.62 → 2241.94] If you believe,
[2242.52 → 2243.38] you're, uh,
[2243.42 → 2243.96] whoa.
[2246.82 → 2247.94] This will be your boss.
[2248.22 → 2249.40] The station specialist
[2249.40 → 2251.96] would have an eye for...
[2251.96 → 2252.40] Huh?
[2252.62 → 2253.78] If you can read it.
[2253.98 → 2254.92] Yeah, it got the job.
[2255.64 → 2256.04] Ah.
[2256.66 → 2258.86] Then we won't you for...
[2258.86 → 2259.54] Then we want you
[2259.54 → 2260.10] for the labs.
[2260.38 → 2260.70] Okay.
[2260.88 → 2261.94] With an eye for details.
[2263.04 → 2263.98] I got there.
[2264.66 → 2265.64] The eye for details
[2265.64 → 2266.40] took me a second.
[2266.54 → 2267.40] How are we hiring
[2267.40 → 2268.60] so many things right now?
[2269.72 → 2271.28] What is a project manager
[2271.28 → 2272.20] float plane, Luke?
[2272.94 → 2273.12] Huh?
[2273.40 → 2274.62] What's a project manager?
[2274.72 → 2275.12] What is this?
[2275.18 → 2276.50] It's a projector
[2276.50 → 2277.40] manager.
[2278.00 → 2278.28] Okay.
[2278.82 → 2279.74] Thanks, Gary Key.
[2280.18 → 2280.80] Yeah, no worries.
[2281.64 → 2282.04] Okay.
[2282.92 → 2284.62] We're closing the back end one.
[2284.82 → 2285.58] I finished writing
[2285.58 → 2286.46] that contract today.
[2286.58 → 2287.24] Accounting just needs
[2287.24 → 2287.84] to sign it off.
[2287.90 → 2288.80] We're closing that position.
[2289.12 → 2289.72] Let's go.
[2290.72 → 2292.60] The project manager one
[2292.60 → 2293.16] is probably going to
[2293.16 → 2293.88] go away as well.
[2294.18 → 2294.80] Oh, okay.
[2294.80 → 2295.80] And...
[2295.80 → 2297.20] But not because
[2297.20 → 2297.82] I found someone
[2297.82 → 2298.40] just because
[2298.40 → 2299.84] it's not really working.
[2299.96 → 2300.42] You give up.
[2300.58 → 2300.76] Okay.
[2301.00 → 2301.72] Well, hey,
[2301.94 → 2303.74] there's time, I guess.
[2304.00 → 2305.30] There is going to be
[2305.30 → 2306.18] probably...
[2306.18 → 2306.78] We're looking through
[2306.78 → 2307.74] current applicants.
[2308.42 → 2310.58] But if that doesn't work out,
[2310.90 → 2312.26] we might be making
[2312.26 → 2312.78] another posting
[2312.78 → 2313.68] for our front end position
[2313.68 → 2314.98] for float plane as well.
[2315.18 → 2315.44] All right.
[2315.88 → 2316.04] Yeah.
[2317.40 → 2318.26] How are we still...
[2318.26 → 2319.10] Okay, we need to take
[2319.10 → 2320.20] a little break at some...
[2320.20 → 2321.60] Mine are pre-budgeted
[2321.60 → 2322.68] and haven't budgeted
[2322.68 → 2323.10] for a while.
[2323.14 → 2323.46] I know.
[2323.62 → 2324.54] Mine are good.
[2324.92 → 2325.60] Leave mine alone.
[2325.96 → 2326.28] I know.
[2326.28 → 2326.88] I'll leave mine.
[2328.72 → 2329.36] Why don't we do
[2329.36 → 2330.22] a couple of merge messages?
[2330.38 → 2331.14] Dan, hit us.
[2331.64 → 2332.18] Sure thing.
[2332.94 → 2334.78] Hello, LLND.
[2334.78 → 2336.00] With the end
[2336.00 → 2337.86] or near the end
[2337.86 → 2338.72] of Moore's Law,
[2338.90 → 2339.66] how do you expect
[2339.66 → 2340.56] to see continued
[2340.56 → 2341.72] generational performance
[2341.72 → 2342.68] improvement as
[2342.68 → 2343.62] the transistors
[2343.62 → 2344.98] can no longer shrink?
[2344.98 → 2350.92] You know,
[2351.90 → 2353.10] I just...
[2353.10 → 2357.86] It seems impossible,
[2358.86 → 2360.46] but they keep doing it.
[2360.46 → 2361.38] Yeah, they keep finding
[2361.38 → 2362.72] some lever to turn,
[2362.86 → 2363.74] some wheel to crank.
[2363.88 → 2364.10] Yeah.
[2364.26 → 2365.30] IPC improvements.
[2365.98 → 2366.28] Yeah.
[2366.48 → 2368.16] Like there are things that...
[2368.16 → 2369.08] Well, 3D stacking.
[2369.46 → 2370.02] Oh, yeah.
[2370.04 → 2370.96] Looks like it is going
[2370.96 → 2372.46] to be huge.
[2372.46 → 2373.78] Uh, chaplets
[2373.78 → 2374.94] look like they are
[2374.94 → 2376.60] going to be huge.
[2376.84 → 2378.16] You might find other ways
[2378.16 → 2379.84] to expand the amount
[2379.84 → 2380.72] that you're using.
[2380.96 → 2381.14] Yeah.
[2381.14 → 2382.00] Not necessarily the amount
[2382.00 → 2383.18] we can fit in a certain area.
[2383.30 → 2384.54] Like, uh, okay,
[2384.66 → 2386.32] technology like in Intel's
[2386.32 → 2387.38] Covers chip
[2387.38 → 2388.40] where they've got...
[2388.40 → 2389.28] I forget.
[2389.46 → 2391.42] It's like three or four
[2391.42 → 2393.44] different manufacturing processes
[2393.44 → 2394.88] and all these buses
[2394.88 → 2395.96] that are communicating
[2395.96 → 2396.82] with each other
[2396.82 → 2397.38] on this, like,
[2397.58 → 2398.54] giant package.
[2399.08 → 2400.58] Um, stuff like...
[2400.58 → 2401.40] Stuff like that
[2401.40 → 2402.76] is going to make its way
[2402.76 → 2404.50] to consumer technology
[2404.50 → 2405.90] or to consumer electronics
[2405.90 → 2406.70] at some point
[2406.70 → 2408.40] and...
[2408.40 → 2410.96] could be a game changer.
[2411.08 → 2412.08] I mean, the way that...
[2412.08 → 2413.08] The way that...
[2413.08 → 2413.92] The way that AI
[2413.92 → 2415.78] is changing the game, too,
[2415.84 → 2417.00] is massive.
[2417.68 → 2419.28] I think that we are
[2419.28 → 2421.00] super mad
[2421.00 → 2422.16] about NVIDIA
[2422.16 → 2423.00] giving us
[2423.00 → 2425.12] underpowered gaming chips
[2425.12 → 2426.46] at a price
[2426.46 → 2427.56] that isn't palatable
[2427.56 → 2428.24] right now.
[2428.24 → 2430.24] but when we look back,
[2430.72 → 2432.18] so 10 years from now,
[2432.30 → 2433.38] when we're playing
[2433.38 → 2435.18] photorealistic games
[2435.18 → 2435.92] at, you know,
[2436.00 → 2437.32] 300 frames per second
[2437.32 → 2437.86] or whatever
[2437.86 → 2438.92] on chips
[2438.92 → 2440.22] that fundamentally
[2440.22 → 2441.20] haven't changed
[2441.20 → 2442.56] nearly as much
[2442.56 → 2444.36] as the 10 years prior,
[2444.62 → 2445.80] we're going to be looking
[2445.80 → 2446.48] at it going,
[2446.86 → 2447.32] wow,
[2447.98 → 2449.66] they were way ahead
[2449.66 → 2450.42] and that was
[2450.42 → 2452.48] early teething pain
[2452.48 → 2454.24] for what was ultimately
[2454.24 → 2455.46] going to be the future.
[2455.46 → 2457.84] I mean,
[2457.90 → 2459.32] just looking at the way
[2459.32 → 2460.00] that...
[2460.00 → 2461.46] Man, I was looking at...
[2463.32 → 2465.62] Oh, this new Photoshop feature
[2465.62 → 2467.80] where you basically just
[2467.80 → 2469.10] give it an image
[2469.10 → 2471.16] and then just tell it like,
[2471.26 → 2471.54] oh, yeah,
[2471.56 → 2472.68] I want a lake in the middle
[2472.68 → 2474.04] and I want a car
[2474.04 → 2474.80] and I want a cloud
[2474.80 → 2475.76] that's shaped like the car.
[2475.82 → 2476.60] You saw the same article
[2476.60 → 2477.30] I did, I think.
[2477.32 → 2478.52] Yeah, I meant to send it
[2478.52 → 2480.18] to our thumbnail designer,
[2480.28 → 2480.74] but I forgot.
[2480.88 → 2481.14] Yeah.
[2481.78 → 2482.60] I'm sure they're already aware.
[2482.60 → 2483.58] So Photoshop just has
[2483.58 → 2485.04] generative AI built in
[2485.04 → 2485.88] and if we're doing that
[2485.88 → 2487.08] in Photoshop now,
[2487.78 → 2488.82] then give it a little bit
[2488.82 → 2489.44] more time
[2489.44 → 2490.26] and we'll be doing that
[2490.26 → 2491.50] in real time in games.
[2491.92 → 2492.12] You know,
[2492.16 → 2493.76] you'll be able to mod a game
[2493.76 → 2495.82] by simply typing in a prompt.
[2496.58 → 2496.98] Okay,
[2497.16 → 2497.94] I want to play
[2497.94 → 2498.90] Super Mario World,
[2499.10 → 2502.54] but all the Koo pas are...
[2502.54 → 2504.24] Man, procedurally generated games
[2504.24 → 2505.52] are going to be a whole new...
[2505.52 → 2507.06] Little faces with moustaches.
[2507.30 → 2508.08] Ball of wax.
[2508.38 → 2509.44] Like, that's insane.
[2509.56 → 2510.20] I don't think I've even
[2510.20 → 2511.08] thought about that before.
[2511.50 → 2511.70] Yeah.
[2511.70 → 2512.96] Procedurally generated games
[2512.96 → 2514.14] so they have to pre-make
[2514.14 → 2514.72] the assets.
[2515.44 → 2515.66] Yeah.
[2515.74 → 2516.60] Like, what?
[2516.60 → 2517.16] It's just like,
[2517.22 → 2518.70] I want to play Half-Life 2,
[2518.94 → 2520.20] but all the opponents
[2520.20 → 2520.92] are donkeys.
[2521.84 → 2522.62] And you know what?
[2522.62 → 2523.56] It's not going to be perfect,
[2524.72 → 2525.76] but it's going to get
[2525.76 → 2527.54] pretty good.
[2527.64 → 2529.88] You can hugely simplify
[2529.88 → 2531.18] the modding scene
[2531.18 → 2531.78] for certain things.
[2531.84 → 2532.46] You know when they make,
[2532.52 → 2532.66] like,
[2532.84 → 2533.80] they made all the dragons
[2533.80 → 2534.44] in Skyrim
[2534.44 → 2535.62] into Thomas the Tank Engine
[2535.62 → 2536.04] or whatever?
[2536.66 → 2537.52] I didn't see that,
[2537.56 → 2538.08] but I love it.
[2538.12 → 2538.66] That's my favourite.
[2538.66 → 2538.68] It's great.
[2538.90 → 2540.72] It's a fantastic mod.
[2540.72 → 2542.22] They even, like,
[2542.28 → 2542.48] chop-chop!
[2542.54 → 2544.32] Yeah, when they fly in,
[2544.38 → 2544.88] you normally hear
[2544.88 → 2545.60] the dragon roar.
[2545.74 → 2547.50] They have a train horn.
[2549.64 → 2550.68] It's very good.
[2550.90 → 2551.64] It's very good.
[2551.94 → 2553.06] But you could do stuff
[2553.06 → 2553.56] like that
[2553.56 → 2554.82] using this instead.
[2555.24 → 2556.20] Oh, did you find it?
[2559.20 → 2560.36] Do you want sound?
[2560.84 → 2561.40] No, no.
[2561.44 → 2562.20] I don't think sound
[2562.20 → 2563.56] will be necessary entirely.
[2564.64 → 2565.50] So it's going to land
[2565.50 → 2566.30] on top of the tower
[2566.30 → 2567.06] that you're looking at
[2567.06 → 2567.38] right now.
[2567.38 → 2567.78] Spoilers.
[2568.22 → 2569.22] Oh, come on.
[2569.22 → 2569.94] It's Skyrim.
[2571.54 → 2571.86] Yeah.
[2574.70 → 2576.74] You see it flying around
[2576.74 → 2577.34] in the background.
[2578.22 → 2579.34] It's going to slam down.
[2579.82 → 2580.18] Boom!
[2585.50 → 2586.56] There's people who would,
[2586.80 → 2588.00] they'd be, like,
[2588.06 → 2588.98] arachnophobic or whatever,
[2589.16 → 2590.02] so they would replace
[2590.02 → 2591.30] all the spiders in the game
[2591.30 → 2591.78] with, like,
[2591.84 → 2592.34] teddy bears
[2592.34 → 2594.16] or whatever else, too.
[2594.16 → 2594.38] Right.
[2594.80 → 2595.04] Yeah.
[2595.32 → 2595.92] So, yeah,
[2595.96 → 2596.82] that sort of thing
[2596.82 → 2598.64] is only going to get easier.
[2598.76 → 2599.60] Oh, so good.
[2599.74 → 2600.34] Which is great.
[2601.06 → 2601.34] Yeah.
[2606.04 → 2606.80] Oh, man.
[2607.10 → 2607.58] That would be,
[2607.66 → 2608.16] you know what would be
[2608.16 → 2609.12] fascinating?
[2609.74 → 2610.52] Oh, man.
[2611.54 → 2612.18] I wonder if we'll get
[2612.18 → 2612.50] to the point.
[2612.56 → 2613.20] You know how we've been
[2613.20 → 2613.98] waiting for,
[2614.48 → 2615.78] or I have,
[2615.94 → 2616.28] whatever,
[2616.80 → 2618.36] for Oblivion
[2618.36 → 2619.18] and Oblivion?
[2619.92 → 2620.10] Yeah.
[2620.10 → 2620.42] Or more,
[2620.56 → 2621.92] Sky wind?
[2621.92 → 2622.28] Sorry.
[2622.52 → 2622.80] There we go.
[2623.04 → 2623.42] Which are,
[2623.58 → 2625.16] it's Morning and Oblivion
[2625.16 → 2627.00] rebuilt in Skyrim's engine
[2627.00 → 2629.66] with really high resolution
[2629.66 → 2630.84] textures and all this
[2630.84 → 2631.34] other kind of stuff.
[2631.58 → 2632.10] Because you can do
[2632.10 → 2633.20] some pretty cool things
[2633.20 → 2633.90] in Skyrim's engine,
[2633.98 → 2634.72] even though it's pretty old.
[2636.18 → 2637.14] I think we're going to get
[2637.14 → 2638.00] to a certain point
[2638.00 → 2638.94] eventually
[2638.94 → 2640.08] where,
[2640.32 → 2641.02] because of,
[2641.18 → 2641.60] because, like,
[2641.70 → 2641.90] yeah,
[2641.96 → 2642.78] it's going to have some issues
[2642.78 → 2643.56] doing this kind of stuff
[2643.56 → 2644.02] out of nowhere,
[2644.16 → 2644.94] creativity problems,
[2645.00 → 2645.52] all that kind of stuff.
[2645.58 → 2646.22] It pulls from something,
[2646.34 → 2646.54] whatever.
[2646.86 → 2647.62] But you might be able
[2647.62 → 2648.18] to go, like,
[2648.22 → 2648.48] okay,
[2648.62 → 2649.64] here's a game.
[2650.54 → 2651.54] Here's all the information
[2651.54 → 2651.78] I have,
[2651.82 → 2652.52] all the local files,
[2652.58 → 2653.10] all that kind of stuff.
[2653.24 → 2654.70] I want you to recreate this
[2654.70 → 2656.78] using UE5 or whatever.
[2657.20 → 2658.22] I want you to recreate this
[2658.22 → 2659.04] using this other thing.
[2659.14 → 2659.30] Oh,
[2659.34 → 2659.98] I see what you mean.
[2660.56 → 2661.50] Because it's pretty good
[2661.50 → 2661.76] at, like,
[2661.84 → 2662.36] translating,
[2662.60 → 2663.00] right?
[2663.14 → 2664.68] Even stuff like RTX Remix.
[2665.44 → 2665.66] You know,
[2665.84 → 2666.16] okay,
[2667.40 → 2669.28] just AI replace
[2669.28 → 2670.16] all the light sources
[2670.16 → 2672.22] with real point light sources.
[2673.60 → 2673.96] Yeah.
[2674.18 → 2674.78] And then you'll have
[2674.78 → 2675.52] to go in and tweak it.
[2675.62 → 2676.72] You'll still have to be
[2676.72 → 2677.88] a graphic designer
[2677.88 → 2678.58] or a game designer
[2678.58 → 2679.06] or whatever else.
[2679.06 → 2679.60] It'll still take work.
[2679.60 → 2681.90] But man.
[2682.16 → 2682.38] Yeah.
[2682.76 → 2683.32] It's like,
[2683.36 → 2684.08] it's like the
[2684.08 → 2685.16] the generative AI
[2685.16 → 2686.00] in Photoshop,
[2686.16 → 2686.28] right?
[2686.30 → 2687.60] It's not replacing artists.
[2687.90 → 2688.14] Yeah.
[2688.24 → 2689.46] We still need an artist
[2689.46 → 2690.18] to do that.
[2690.24 → 2690.32] I mean,
[2690.32 → 2691.02] all the same people
[2691.02 → 2691.96] who do all the same stuff.
[2692.02 → 2693.14] It just makes their job easier.
[2693.72 → 2694.12] Well,
[2694.20 → 2695.00] more realistically,
[2695.00 → 2695.98] it makes it so they have
[2695.98 → 2696.80] to do more of it.
[2697.06 → 2697.64] But yeah.
[2697.64 → 2697.74] Yeah.
[2697.74 → 2698.68] Because that's what
[2698.68 → 2699.82] working here is like.
[2701.28 → 2702.50] There's always going to be
[2702.50 → 2703.16] stuff to do
[2703.16 → 2704.96] that is never a concern.
[2704.96 → 2706.42] I mean,
[2706.46 → 2706.92] that's what,
[2706.98 → 2708.34] that's what work is like,
[2708.56 → 2708.80] Luke.
[2708.84 → 2709.08] Yeah.
[2709.38 → 2710.54] I don't make the freaking,
[2710.66 → 2711.82] I was reading a
[2711.94 → 2712.52] I was,
[2712.58 → 2713.48] I was reading an article.
[2713.84 → 2714.28] They,
[2714.36 → 2715.40] they surveyed a bunch of,
[2715.40 → 2716.02] I'm not saying that in a bad way
[2716.02 → 2716.36] to be clear.
[2716.36 → 2717.32] They surveyed a bunch of
[2717.32 → 2719.06] Gen Z and millennial people
[2719.06 → 2720.68] who have sort of
[2720.68 → 2722.60] pioneered this concept of,
[2722.60 → 2724.18] it's called lying flat in China
[2724.18 → 2725.92] or quiet quitting
[2725.92 → 2727.06] in North America
[2727.06 → 2728.00] of,
[2728.12 → 2728.44] you know,
[2728.78 → 2729.06] the
[2729.26 → 2729.38] their,
[2729.46 → 2730.88] their top priorities being,
[2730.88 → 2731.40] you know,
[2731.40 → 2732.26] work-life balance
[2732.26 → 2733.20] as opposed to
[2733.20 → 2733.96] all these other things.
[2733.96 → 2735.28] And then when they
[2735.28 → 2737.18] continue asking them questions,
[2737.18 → 2738.20] they're like,
[2738.28 → 2738.50] okay,
[2738.58 → 2738.82] right.
[2738.92 → 2740.26] But do,
[2740.46 → 2741.30] is that a
[2741.38 → 2742.14] is that a thing?
[2742.16 → 2742.56] And they're like,
[2742.60 → 2742.84] no,
[2744.32 → 2744.66] no,
[2744.66 → 2746.54] actually I have a second job
[2746.54 → 2747.60] hustling because
[2747.60 → 2749.34] you get bored.
[2749.54 → 2749.94] Well,
[2750.02 → 2750.42] no,
[2750.56 → 2750.80] no,
[2750.84 → 2751.42] it's just
[2751.42 → 2753.66] inflation's out of control.
[2753.94 → 2754.50] Like it's,
[2754.50 → 2755.84] it's not actually feasible.
[2756.10 → 2756.28] Yeah.
[2756.38 → 2757.54] Like you have to,
[2757.72 → 2758.16] you have to,
[2758.22 → 2759.18] you have to bust your butt.
[2759.44 → 2760.82] And so it's this sort of
[2760.82 → 2762.38] aspirational thing.
[2763.78 → 2763.98] I,
[2764.14 → 2766.86] I don't know.
[2766.92 → 2767.44] It's a
[2767.48 → 2768.36] it's a
[2768.36 → 2768.88] it's a big,
[2768.94 → 2769.76] it's a big challenge.
[2769.86 → 2770.62] It's one of those things
[2770.62 → 2772.48] where I feel like we,
[2772.62 → 2773.42] we do,
[2773.54 → 2775.36] I think a pretty good job
[2775.36 → 2776.32] of trying to make it
[2776.32 → 2777.00] so that people
[2777.00 → 2779.30] don't have to work outside
[2779.30 → 2780.18] their 40 hours.
[2783.82 → 2784.94] But it's tough right now,
[2785.02 → 2785.88] by and large,
[2785.92 → 2787.00] the way the world's going
[2787.00 → 2787.54] right now,
[2787.54 → 2787.90] it's,
[2788.10 → 2789.42] it's not like that.
[2789.42 → 2790.50] Um,
[2790.66 → 2790.96] it's,
[2791.00 → 2791.76] it has shifted
[2791.76 → 2792.34] from,
[2792.54 → 2792.76] uh,
[2792.76 → 2793.18] from a
[2793.30 → 2794.46] from an employee's market
[2794.46 → 2795.58] to an employer's market.
[2795.58 → 2796.86] Like looking at what's going on
[2796.86 → 2798.36] with the big tech firms
[2798.36 → 2799.90] and the way that they're
[2799.90 → 2801.60] bringing everyone back to office,
[2802.02 → 2803.00] cutting perks,
[2803.48 → 2804.16] laying off
[2804.16 → 2805.66] literally thousands,
[2805.86 → 2806.90] sometimes tens of thousands
[2806.90 → 2807.50] of staff.
[2808.06 → 2809.36] I watched a video recently
[2809.36 → 2810.38] of a certain
[2810.38 → 2811.98] excessively rich person
[2811.98 → 2813.20] and it was like,
[2813.52 → 2813.84] uh,
[2813.84 → 2814.64] how much is a banana?
[2814.76 → 2815.26] If we,
[2815.42 → 2815.80] no,
[2815.92 → 2816.40] something else.
[2816.58 → 2817.50] That one was hilarious.
[2817.50 → 2818.32] That was hilarious.
[2818.34 → 2818.90] Very funny.
[2819.14 → 2819.48] But no,
[2819.54 → 2819.92] they were like,
[2819.96 → 2820.12] okay,
[2820.12 → 2821.26] if we take this person's
[2821.26 → 2821.78] net wealth
[2821.78 → 2824.72] in single American dollar bills,
[2825.08 → 2826.18] so like one US dollar,
[2826.36 → 2827.08] because I know a lot of other
[2827.08 → 2827.74] countries don't have that,
[2827.78 → 2828.38] so I'm making sure you know,
[2828.70 → 2829.16] um,
[2829.16 → 2831.50] and we stacked it like horizontally
[2831.50 → 2832.98] and tried to wrap around the world.
[2833.16 → 2833.40] Yeah.
[2833.60 → 2834.18] How many times?
[2834.18 → 2834.92] How far would we get?
[2836.14 → 2837.52] Single US dollar bills.
[2837.68 → 2838.50] Like the width.
[2838.60 → 2838.84] Almost,
[2839.06 → 2839.28] yeah,
[2839.66 → 2840.64] pressed against each other.
[2840.72 → 2840.96] Right,
[2841.06 → 2841.28] okay.
[2841.28 → 2841.86] You almost make it
[2841.86 → 2842.96] the whole way around the world.
[2843.14 → 2843.50] Wow.
[2843.64 → 2844.24] And it's just like,
[2844.60 → 2848.08] does this make any sense?
[2848.20 → 2848.36] Like,
[2848.42 → 2849.02] I don't know.
[2849.12 → 2849.42] Anyway,
[2849.62 → 2849.86] sorry,
[2850.12 → 2851.30] we'll get back on to the tech topics.
[2852.60 → 2852.84] Oh,
[2852.90 → 2853.10] no,
[2853.16 → 2854.32] I think we're supposed to actually
[2854.32 → 2855.48] do a couple more merch messages.
[2858.70 → 2859.06] Ah,
[2859.14 → 2860.22] give us a merch message anyway.
[2860.36 → 2860.62] Yeah.
[2860.76 → 2861.16] Come on,
[2861.22 → 2862.18] give us a merch message,
[2862.30 → 2862.44] David.
[2862.58 → 2863.50] This one's from Jordan.
[2863.50 → 2865.50] What's the longest you have ever worked
[2865.50 → 2866.40] in one shift?
[2868.40 → 2868.80] Oh,
[2868.86 → 2869.14] I mean,
[2869.22 → 2869.56] there was,
[2869.60 → 2870.98] I knew that would get a giggle from Luke.
[2871.72 → 2872.74] Peanut butter crackers.
[2874.64 → 2875.80] 700 series launch.
[2876.34 → 2877.30] 700 series launch.
[2877.36 → 2878.12] I'm pretty sure I was awake
[2878.12 → 2878.88] for like four days.
[2880.26 → 2880.70] See,
[2880.78 → 2881.38] I don't know.
[2881.50 → 2882.58] I've done some pretty,
[2882.76 → 2884.78] I've done some pretty dumb stuff too.
[2884.98 → 2886.96] It depends on how we define work.
[2887.14 → 2887.40] Like,
[2887.46 → 2888.80] we didn't use to classify
[2888.80 → 2890.40] sitting on a plane as work,
[2890.62 → 2893.30] but we apparently do now.
[2893.50 → 2894.32] Um,
[2895.60 → 2895.86] yeah,
[2895.92 → 2896.10] it's,
[2896.10 → 2896.32] it's,
[2896.32 → 2897.16] it's complicated.
[2897.32 → 2897.50] Yeah.
[2897.90 → 2898.12] Yeah.
[2898.12 → 2898.30] It's,
[2898.30 → 2898.96] it's complicated.
[2899.60 → 2900.00] Um,
[2900.72 → 2904.10] but I remember when David and I,
[2904.32 → 2904.64] and,
[2904.68 → 2905.00] uh,
[2905.02 → 2906.56] someone from the business team came with us.
[2906.56 → 2907.10] I can't remember,
[2907.10 → 2910.10] but we went to and from Germany in like 30 hours,
[2910.10 → 2912.02] like doorstep to doorstep.
[2912.02 → 2912.52] Yeah.
[2912.58 → 2914.64] So that wasn't technically one shift,
[2914.64 → 2915.98] but good gravy.
[2916.34 → 2916.66] Uh,
[2916.66 → 2917.68] was that ever intense?
[2917.68 → 2920.36] Cause that's like an 11-hour flight or something like that.
[2920.36 → 2921.40] Or like nine hour flight.
[2921.46 → 2923.02] I can't remember exactly how long it is.
[2923.12 → 2924.68] We shot a video on the other side.
[2924.68 → 2925.12] Like we,
[2925.58 → 2928.06] like we worked and then we were back.
[2928.30 → 2928.66] Um,
[2929.88 → 2930.24] those,
[2930.36 → 2933.74] those touch and go trips can be pretty exhausting.
[2934.10 → 2934.40] Yeah.
[2934.70 → 2934.98] Yeah.
[2935.30 → 2935.70] Yeah.
[2938.10 → 2938.54] Ah,
[2939.06 → 2943.86] I think that trip to Germany was probably my worst.
[2944.54 → 2947.22] The worst recently was what we went through with the
[2947.22 → 2947.48] uh,
[2947.48 → 2948.60] the channel hijacking though.
[2948.62 → 2950.60] I think it hasn't been that bad in a while.
[2951.10 → 2951.90] We try,
[2952.04 → 2953.28] we actually try.
[2953.42 → 2954.36] People are constantly,
[2954.48 → 2956.10] why do you have so many people on staff?
[2956.32 → 2956.98] Because we're trying.
[2957.00 → 2958.10] Because we are actually.
[2958.10 → 2958.88] Because we're trying.
[2958.98 → 2959.42] Trying.
[2959.80 → 2960.12] Yeah.
[2960.36 → 2961.96] It's not always easy.
[2961.96 → 2962.98] I enjoyed that one.
[2963.08 → 2964.92] Because this is my,
[2965.00 → 2965.22] this is,
[2965.22 → 2965.86] I'm broken.
[2965.86 → 2966.40] And this,
[2966.48 → 2968.52] this is my problem.
[2968.64 → 2970.70] Because you're like talking about how that's a victory.
[2971.02 → 2971.96] But for me,
[2972.00 → 2974.12] those are all like my favourite memories.
[2974.32 → 2974.46] Yeah.
[2974.54 → 2977.44] But then I have to remember that that's not normal.
[2977.52 → 2978.28] That's not realistic.
[2979.10 → 2979.86] Or that.
[2979.96 → 2980.12] Yeah.
[2980.22 → 2981.60] Because I will break.
[2981.90 → 2982.82] So I have to like,
[2983.46 → 2984.44] but I enjoy those.
[2984.54 → 2986.46] So I kind of like it when it happens sometimes.
[2986.66 → 2986.98] Yeah.
[2987.18 → 2988.12] But I don't like,
[2988.14 → 2990.28] it probably shouldn't happen too often, or I'll,
[2990.84 → 2991.54] I'm old now.
[2991.54 → 2992.34] I can't do that all the time,
[2992.46 → 2993.68] but I do like those moments.
[2993.68 → 2993.88] You're old.
[2994.22 → 2994.96] I'm getting there.
[2995.60 → 2996.32] I'm getting there.
[2996.42 → 2997.24] I'm starting to feel it.
[2998.22 → 3000.48] The recovery time from things is getting long.
[3000.72 → 3001.10] Oh yeah.
[3001.74 → 3002.02] Oh yeah.
[3002.02 → 3002.72] It doesn't get better.
[3002.76 → 3004.40] That's the main thing that I'm noticing.
[3004.70 → 3004.96] I'm not,
[3004.96 → 3006.36] not a lot else is really that,
[3006.54 → 3006.92] you know,
[3006.98 → 3007.98] but if I,
[3008.06 → 3009.12] if I go too far,
[3009.62 → 3010.12] it's like,
[3010.12 → 3010.32] okay,
[3010.32 → 3011.12] I need to rest.
[3011.94 → 3012.58] I'll be like,
[3012.60 → 3013.82] I'll be good in like a day.
[3013.82 → 3015.64] And then it's like a week passes.
[3015.64 → 3016.18] And I'm like,
[3016.18 → 3017.22] I'm still feeling it.
[3017.40 → 3017.68] Yep.
[3018.08 → 3018.40] Yep.
[3018.82 → 3019.22] Yeah.
[3019.22 → 3019.90] It's not,
[3019.94 → 3021.72] it's not going to get better from here on out.
[3021.76 → 3022.52] I'll tell you that much.
[3022.60 → 3022.82] Yep.
[3023.02 → 3023.68] 30 is rough.
[3023.76 → 3024.62] 35 is worse.
[3025.26 → 3025.64] Nice.
[3027.32 → 3027.80] I,
[3027.96 → 3028.24] uh,
[3028.24 → 3029.10] I had my,
[3029.14 → 3031.44] my badminton training session last night,
[3031.44 → 3031.96] uh,
[3031.96 → 3032.12] my,
[3032.14 → 3033.30] my Thursday night session.
[3033.70 → 3034.14] Uh,
[3034.14 → 3037.54] I didn't message you this because Luke was messaging me the week prior.
[3037.68 → 3040.26] I think telling me how much water he drank at one of his things.
[3040.62 → 3045.22] So in two hours and 20 minutes,
[3045.22 → 3047.86] I drank two and a half of these.
[3048.08 → 3050.36] That is 100 ounces of water.
[3051.36 → 3052.60] And let me put it this way.
[3052.90 → 3053.78] I didn't go pee.
[3053.78 → 3058.90] I am annihilated right now.
[3058.90 → 3062.24] Like I am so sore and so tired.
[3062.50 → 3064.92] I don't know what he was trying to do to me.
[3065.00 → 3065.74] I told him,
[3065.78 → 3066.18] I was like,
[3066.24 → 3066.56] David,
[3066.78 → 3072.24] I'm going to Taiwan to play badminton every day and cover a trade show.
[3072.92 → 3075.66] Why are we doing all smash practice today?
[3075.66 → 3078.92] I,
[3079.00 → 3079.16] we,
[3079.16 → 3081.82] we've been planning this video for a long time and things just keep coming up,
[3081.84 → 3082.10] but we'll,
[3082.16 → 3084.36] we will do it where we're going to go to the gym.
[3084.60 → 3085.12] And I,
[3085.24 → 3089.42] I at no point in time have actually known what the like point was or what we're
[3089.42 → 3090.84] like actually supposed to do.
[3091.46 → 3092.18] So I've had,
[3092.26 → 3093.16] I've just in my head,
[3093.18 → 3096.48] I've had these various ideas for like a while,
[3096.66 → 3097.78] just different,
[3097.86 → 3098.16] like,
[3098.70 → 3098.88] ah,
[3098.88 → 3099.58] maybe we'll do this.
[3099.62 → 3100.28] Maybe we'll do that.
[3100.32 → 3101.54] And then eventually I was like,
[3101.56 → 3101.84] you know,
[3101.96 → 3105.12] I was hoping this was going to be a recurring thing, and it's not going to be.
[3105.12 → 3107.94] So I'm just going to like to hurt him.
[3108.62 → 3108.98] What?
[3109.14 → 3112.94] I'm just going to make it so hard that like,
[3113.00 → 3115.06] he's just going to wake up the deck today and not be able to move.
[3115.20 → 3115.88] And then I was like,
[3116.18 → 3118.58] I like enjoyed this idea.
[3118.72 → 3119.32] And then I was like,
[3119.38 → 3119.52] no,
[3119.56 → 3120.18] I can't.
[3120.18 → 3120.54] Cause like,
[3120.56 → 3121.36] we're too old now.
[3121.46 → 3123.84] If we were back when we first started doing this,
[3123.96 → 3125.64] that would have probably been fine.
[3125.88 → 3126.20] Yeah.
[3126.32 → 3127.80] If this was 10 years ago,
[3127.80 → 3129.56] we probably would have both been fine.
[3129.62 → 3130.80] But now if I do that,
[3130.86 → 3134.74] it's like actually going to be a problem, and you'd probably make me do it with you.
[3134.74 → 3137.56] So we'd both just be wrecked for like ever.
[3138.62 → 3139.02] Okay.
[3139.02 → 3139.26] Well,
[3139.28 → 3139.92] I can't do that.
[3139.98 → 3141.00] So back to the drawing board.
[3141.20 → 3141.64] It's like,
[3141.70 → 3142.82] all right.
[3145.70 → 3146.30] All right.
[3146.34 → 3148.08] Why don't we jump into our next topic here?
[3148.24 → 3158.46] No one wants to buy the RTX 4060 Ti in spite of my best efforts after taking a back alley deal from NVIDIA to promote their new GPU.
[3158.46 → 3161.46] Slash S.
[3164.34 → 3168.36] NVIDIA's new RTX 4060 Ti has been met with low consumer interest.
[3168.48 → 3172.50] Many retailers only ordered a few cards per store.
[3172.50 → 3174.22] And in some areas,
[3174.36 → 3175.22] especially Europe,
[3175.38 → 3180.72] they're already offering the cards for 10 to $25 below the recommended retail price.
[3180.84 → 3183.04] And this is probably because in Europe,
[3183.04 → 3192.18] the recommended retail prices are particularly brutal because NVIDIA apparently doesn't attend the XE.com school of how currency conversion works.
[3192.18 → 3194.24] At the same time though,
[3194.64 → 3198.18] NVIDIA's market valuation increased by 30%.
[3198.70 → 3199.44] Yeah.
[3199.64 → 3208.76] 30% their stock went up in the last two days or something like that due to high demand for LLM chips.
[3209.18 → 3210.86] So a large language model chips,
[3211.02 → 3212.56] like machine learning chips.
[3212.56 → 3218.56] NVIDIA don't give an f*** about gamers anymore.
[3218.68 → 3220.38] It's so annoying because like,
[3220.48 → 3220.74] yeah,
[3220.86 → 3223.86] they had crypto stuff and then that sort of died.
[3224.00 → 3224.56] And we were like,
[3224.60 → 3224.82] yeah,
[3225.08 → 3226.24] come back to us.
[3226.46 → 3227.56] Come crawling back,
[3227.66 → 3227.92] baby.
[3228.06 → 3229.06] And they're back for like,
[3229.48 → 3229.80] what,
[3229.88 → 3230.66] not even a year?
[3231.80 → 3232.32] And then they're like,
[3232.40 → 3232.84] ooh,
[3233.00 → 3234.14] new wave to ride.
[3234.22 → 3234.82] Let's go.
[3235.30 → 3235.50] Like,
[3235.66 → 3235.96] oh,
[3236.12 → 3236.90] come on.
[3238.40 → 3238.84] Oh,
[3238.84 → 3242.20] well.
[3242.56 → 3244.30] Anyway,
[3244.50 → 3244.88] AMD,
[3245.08 → 3245.50] of course,
[3245.68 → 3249.70] dropped prices on the 7600 XT down to 269,
[3249.86 → 3252.46] only 36 hours before launch.
[3252.52 → 3252.66] Okay.
[3253.26 → 3254.86] I'd actually like to talk about that.
[3255.64 → 3259.96] We had a whole shtick for that video where the intro was going to be,
[3260.08 → 3260.50] AMD,
[3261.04 → 3265.88] I'd be happy to help you learn how to benchmark GPUs so that you can price your cards appropriately.
[3265.88 → 3267.38] And we actually left in part of it.
[3267.46 → 3269.58] And then we kind of went record scratch.
[3271.76 → 3272.20] AMD,
[3272.56 → 3274.22] change the price of the card.
[3277.30 → 3278.20] If all,
[3278.48 → 3285.50] I don't want us to get too good guy AMD about them bringing this card out at a price that is somewhat reasonable.
[3286.44 → 3288.20] Because it's somewhat reasonable.
[3288.40 → 3288.84] Because,
[3289.08 → 3289.28] yeah,
[3289.44 → 3289.70] A,
[3289.86 → 3291.44] it's only somewhat reasonable.
[3291.54 → 3291.72] Yeah.
[3291.72 → 3293.74] It's in line with the rest of their lineup,
[3293.88 → 3295.36] which they did,
[3295.62 → 3295.90] you know,
[3295.94 → 3297.60] get aggressive on a little bit.
[3297.72 → 3299.18] But that's only to,
[3299.36 → 3300.08] you know,
[3300.10 → 3305.10] deal with the fact that GPU demand is apparently like at a historic low right now or something like that.
[3305.16 → 3305.26] Like,
[3305.32 → 3307.72] this is not out of the goodness of their hearts.
[3307.72 → 3309.04] And B,
[3309.04 → 3313.48] they only did it at the last second.
[3313.48 → 3315.86] like,
[3315.86 → 3317.52] very last second.
[3317.94 → 3327.12] Changing the price of a GPU a day and a half before its public launch is a colossal undertaking.
[3327.12 → 3332.96] Because they have to basically redo all the contracts that they have with their board partners.
[3333.62 → 3334.06] Right?
[3334.06 → 3335.30] They have to,
[3335.42 → 3338.18] they have to go and do like a bunch of paperwork.
[3338.34 → 3338.92] I mean,
[3338.96 → 3341.94] I imagine the accounting department would absolutely hate this.
[3342.02 → 3342.20] Right?
[3343.54 → 3349.76] And I want us to not lose track of the fact that if they were able to price it at $269,
[3349.94 → 3351.78] 36 hours from launch,
[3352.18 → 3354.32] they could have priced it at $269,
[3354.56 → 3357.42] 36 days from launch.
[3358.10 → 3363.38] There is nothing about the cost of this card that necessitated the $299 price
[3363.38 → 3366.38] that they originally announced to the press.
[3367.42 → 3367.98] Nothing.
[3368.76 → 3369.24] Clearly.
[3369.72 → 3378.38] And it was only due to some kind of probably intense pressure that they would have made a last minute change like this.
[3380.82 → 3381.34] So,
[3381.66 → 3382.28] I'm,
[3382.32 → 3383.20] I'm annoyed.
[3383.52 → 3386.00] I find it extremely disrespectful.
[3386.44 → 3386.70] They're like,
[3386.82 → 3387.00] when these,
[3387.40 → 3388.94] good guy by association.
[3390.26 → 3391.58] Because the other guy's worse?
[3392.02 → 3392.30] Yeah,
[3392.30 → 3392.60] well,
[3392.74 → 3394.02] it's more just like,
[3394.68 → 3396.26] they could have just done this.
[3397.04 → 3397.62] They could have,
[3397.68 → 3398.94] they could have been,
[3399.22 → 3399.50] you know,
[3399.60 → 3400.20] pro consumer.
[3400.30 → 3402.82] They could have cared about consumer value in the first place.
[3402.92 → 3406.24] And they could have had it at a good price.
[3406.70 → 3407.90] But they didn't.
[3407.98 → 3411.08] There are clearly a lot of internal forces at AMD
[3411.08 → 3416.94] that wanted this card to be priced as high as the market could possibly bear.
[3416.94 → 3420.98] And it was only at the last second that they ultimately made the decision to back down.
[3421.54 → 3427.70] And it's extremely disrespectful to everyone else who's involved in the launch of a product like this,
[3427.70 → 3428.82] including media partners.
[3429.32 → 3432.54] And I know there's going to be the people out there whose takes,
[3432.66 → 3433.04] you know what?
[3433.08 → 3433.22] Yeah,
[3433.30 → 3436.82] maybe I will just start shadow-banning because they're phenomenally stupid.
[3437.20 → 3439.38] But whose takes on this are going to be,
[3439.38 → 3440.18] oh,
[3440.28 → 3440.56] wow,
[3440.72 → 3442.58] complaining about free GPUs.
[3443.80 → 3446.40] Do you think I need a 7600 XT?
[3446.48 → 3449.08] Do you think that meaningfully changes my life?
[3449.08 → 3449.52] Right.
[3449.96 → 3450.50] This is,
[3450.60 → 3451.06] this is,
[3451.20 → 3457.52] our job is to make these reviews so that people know what to buy.
[3457.64 → 3457.88] That's,
[3457.94 → 3458.68] that's the whole point.
[3458.78 → 3464.20] And then the way that that symbiotic relationship works with the manufacturers is if they make a good product,
[3464.20 → 3466.94] then as long as we are independent and trusted,
[3466.94 → 3469.84] that will dramatically improve their sales.
[3470.38 → 3472.80] And the second we're not independent and trusted,
[3472.80 → 3474.40] it will have no impact whatsoever.
[3474.40 → 3477.54] So it's in their interest to support an independent media.
[3478.12 → 3478.36] Right.
[3478.36 → 3479.20] Um,
[3479.64 → 3485.40] and so when they don't give us the tools to do our jobs properly,
[3485.40 → 3486.36] well,
[3486.42 → 3487.82] it's disrespectful to us.
[3487.82 → 3490.02] And it's also disrespectful to you guys.
[3490.02 → 3494.48] There was a not insignificant probability that if any outlet,
[3494.70 → 3495.06] you know,
[3495.06 → 3497.20] had a family emergency or something like that,
[3497.24 → 3501.64] they wouldn't be able to get the proper message out to their viewers.
[3501.64 → 3501.82] Now,
[3501.88 → 3503.70] the good news is that for any written outlet,
[3504.10 → 3507.96] a price change is theoretically pretty easy to adjust.
[3507.96 → 3509.44] You just kind of go,
[3509.58 → 3509.74] Oh,
[3510.82 → 3511.38] okay.
[3511.54 → 3512.02] Uh,
[3512.02 → 3513.44] control H two 99,
[3514.10 → 3514.70] uh,
[3514.70 → 3515.36] two 69,
[3515.50 → 3515.96] replace,
[3515.96 → 3522.44] but because it's so dramatically changed the value proposition of this card,
[3522.44 → 3525.44] which is a value tier card.
[3525.48 → 3526.46] I wouldn't say budget,
[3526.60 → 3528.12] but definitely it's,
[3528.22 → 3529.28] it's about the value.
[3529.28 → 3532.94] You're not buying a 7,600 XT because you're going for the utmost in performance.
[3533.06 → 3534.58] You want bang for the buck,
[3534.64 → 3534.88] right?
[3534.88 → 3535.98] And it,
[3535.98 → 3536.82] it changed,
[3536.98 → 3541.92] it changed the angle of the video a lot.
[3542.10 → 3543.10] And for video,
[3543.10 → 3545.60] that's even harder to adjust because you need to change the script.
[3545.60 → 3546.46] Then you need to reshoot it.
[3546.46 → 3548.22] We actually had to fully reshoot that video.
[3548.36 → 3558.54] The only reason that we reused some of our original shoot was because I just kind of thought it was funny to have my outfit changed sporadically throughout,
[3558.64 → 3560.16] throughout the video.
[3560.16 → 3561.36] Um,
[3563.30 → 3563.54] yeah,
[3563.66 → 3563.86] yeah.
[3563.90 → 3564.16] Okay.
[3564.26 → 3564.48] Oh,
[3564.54 → 3564.90] okay.
[3564.92 → 3565.50] This is great.
[3565.50 → 3565.74] Uh,
[3565.74 → 3566.10] in our,
[3566.20 → 3566.80] in our notes here,
[3566.82 → 3571.32] it says communication of the drop was scattered, and some reviews did actually go up based on the original price,
[3571.38 → 3574.92] which is not a proper service to,
[3575.00 → 3575.32] to you,
[3575.40 → 3575.76] the viewer,
[3575.76 → 3576.54] uh,
[3576.56 → 3581.00] AMD's board partners seem to have stuck with the two 70 price except the
[3581.00 → 3584.16] DOG Strip OC edition at $340.
[3585.24 → 3585.72] Um,
[3585.80 → 3589.98] and then Best Buy has made the interesting choice to price multiple models of the 7,600 at 380.
[3589.98 → 3593.64] And that's probably because they haven't actually gotten written,
[3593.88 → 3602.48] signed confirmation of any kind of rebates that they might be getting on these cards that they probably got allocation of completely sight unseen,
[3602.48 → 3603.68] not knowing what the pricing was,
[3603.68 → 3606.44] or they got the original pricing only for it to change later.
[3607.08 → 3607.24] Uh,
[3607.24 → 3608.24] Intel apparently though,
[3608.36 → 3612.16] took the opportunity to slash the A750 to 199.
[3613.80 → 3614.78] That's actually,
[3615.02 → 3615.32] um,
[3615.52 → 3617.08] a pretty interesting price.
[3617.08 → 3618.82] AV1 encoding,
[3619.56 → 3621.16] solid 1080p performance.
[3621.48 → 3622.62] And with being able to stream,
[3622.74 → 3622.94] like,
[3623.50 → 3629.08] there's a very strong argument at that price for streamers grabbing that just as their,
[3629.18 → 3629.90] their streaming card.
[3630.40 → 3630.88] Yeah.
[3631.02 → 3631.84] 200 bucks.
[3632.50 → 3632.92] Man,
[3632.96 → 3634.36] that's a lot of hardware for 200 bucks.
[3634.90 → 3635.42] Meanwhile,
[3636.04 → 3636.58] meanwhile,
[3636.72 → 3641.40] Nvidia wants a hundred dollars for just eight gigs of the Ram on that card.
[3641.40 → 3646.10] And if it doesn't sell,
[3646.20 → 3646.44] man,
[3646.52 → 3648.46] I just don't think they're going to give any FS.
[3649.50 → 3650.68] They're so busy.
[3650.74 → 3651.76] The LLM cards,
[3651.86 → 3652.04] whatever.
[3652.04 → 3657.08] They're so busy selling every wafer they can book at TSMC right now.
[3657.22 → 3657.34] Yeah.
[3657.58 → 3657.82] Like,
[3657.88 → 3657.94] oh,
[3657.94 → 3658.86] it's not performing as well.
[3658.86 → 3659.14] AI startups.
[3659.36 → 3660.14] Just don't book more time.
[3660.62 → 3660.78] Yeah.
[3660.84 → 3661.18] Who cares?
[3661.46 → 3661.64] Yeah.
[3661.70 → 3662.06] Whatever.
[3662.18 → 3663.92] Just shift production to,
[3663.92 → 3665.48] to Teslas or whatever.
[3665.72 → 3665.94] Yeah.
[3666.70 → 3667.34] Or AA,
[3667.34 → 3669.04] whatever they call it these days.
[3669.04 → 3670.66] I think the Tesla branding is gone,
[3670.76 → 3670.92] but.
[3672.28 → 3673.20] Was it a 4,000?
[3673.30 → 3673.72] Is that right?
[3674.28 → 3674.70] No,
[3674.78 → 3677.04] I think it's a 6,000 or something like that.
[3677.04 → 3677.66] I can't,
[3677.68 → 3681.70] I can't remember anymore because it seems like they have intentionally made their product
[3681.70 → 3684.00] stack just completely unintuitive.
[3684.42 → 3684.52] Yeah.
[3684.72 → 3686.98] Why did they take away the Squadron name?
[3687.06 → 3687.78] It was so good.
[3687.78 → 3688.14] Yeah.
[3688.26 → 3693.06] And then they had like two different generations of workstation card that have the same
[3693.06 → 3693.52] model.
[3693.70 → 3695.92] The only thing that they did that I didn't like was,
[3695.94 → 3696.96] they would have like weird,
[3696.96 → 3700.90] like Best Buy exclusive generations and then skip over them for everybody else.
[3701.08 → 3702.00] That was the only thing.
[3702.36 → 3703.94] Basically all the rest of it was fine.
[3704.84 → 3705.52] Just leave it alone.
[3705.70 → 3705.82] Oh,
[3705.96 → 3706.12] now,
[3706.12 → 3707.60] now Nvidia's naming is,
[3707.64 → 3708.14] is a nightmare.
[3708.14 → 3708.58] Now it's a mess.
[3708.66 → 3710.18] And so is AMD's for that matter.
[3710.32 → 3710.46] I,
[3710.58 → 3710.90] I,
[3711.10 → 3716.86] I have gained a renewed interest in AMD's cards because they're just a killer value right
[3716.86 → 3721.64] now from about $180 up to realistically like 450,
[3721.90 → 3722.64] 500 bucks.
[3722.64 → 3728.46] And so as part of that scrapyard GPU war thing where I was trying to get the
[3728.46 → 3733.06] the best bang for the buck GPU for around the price of a 4060 Ti at retail,
[3733.06 → 3739.32] I ended up doing a bunch of research into AMD cards that I hadn't really paid much attention
[3739.32 → 3739.50] to.
[3739.78 → 3742.08] Their product stack is a mess.
[3742.08 → 3744.08] They have a 6600,
[3744.26 → 3746.26] a 6600 XT,
[3746.44 → 3748.86] and then they have a 6650 XT.
[3749.00 → 3750.92] But then in the 7000 generation,
[3751.20 → 3752.64] they're not doing fifties.
[3752.76 → 3757.04] They're doing XT X for the better one.
[3757.32 → 3758.00] And I'm just,
[3758.10 → 3759.16] I'm looking at this going,
[3759.30 → 3761.06] what the
[3761.26 → 3762.88] what the hell is going on?
[3763.20 → 3764.46] Sometimes you have an XT.
[3764.60 → 3765.86] Sometimes you have a 50.
[3765.86 → 3768.70] Sometimes the XT is a huge jump.
[3768.80 → 3770.36] Sometimes the 50 is a big jump,
[3770.44 → 3771.44] but they're both XTs.
[3771.92 → 3778.94] I cannot wait for the lab to just have a database where I can just go,
[3779.06 → 3779.16] okay,
[3779.24 → 3781.38] get that game at that resolution.
[3781.74 → 3782.22] And just,
[3782.22 → 3783.32] just show me all of them,
[3783.72 → 3785.04] please.
[3785.74 → 3786.14] Lab.
[3786.28 → 3786.76] I'm so ready.
[3786.90 → 3787.48] I haven't,
[3787.48 → 3788.60] I haven't told them yet,
[3788.60 → 3791.44] but one of the things that I would like for us to do,
[3791.78 → 3793.78] never mind GPU reviews.
[3794.52 → 3798.84] One of the things that I would like for them to do is have enough test benches
[3798.84 → 3800.88] that we can run in,
[3800.88 → 3802.16] that we can run in parallel.
[3802.54 → 3806.34] And we can basically like once a year,
[3806.78 → 3807.98] maybe twice a year,
[3808.08 → 3809.74] if we can make it automated enough,
[3809.94 → 3813.04] we just throw every card back on,
[3813.58 → 3817.98] run it with the latest drivers and just have this database be up-to-date.
[3818.60 → 3822.72] So you can just compare functionally anything with a PCIe slot.
[3823.12 → 3823.34] I have,
[3823.34 → 3827.08] I have vaguely mentioned this, and I saw hearts shatter.
[3827.52 → 3827.88] Um,
[3829.10 → 3830.44] but I'm sure we'll get there eventually.
[3830.56 → 3830.98] I think it'll,
[3831.06 → 3832.32] I just think it'll take a long time.
[3832.32 → 3833.42] They just need more test benches.
[3833.42 → 3833.78] I mean,
[3833.92 → 3834.26] if it,
[3834.32 → 3840.60] if it gets as simple as we can use machine vision to set up the infrastructure
[3840.60 → 3842.76] behind all that is going to be like pretty intense.
[3843.10 → 3843.54] Yeah,
[3843.54 → 3844.88] but that sounds like videos to me.
[3845.80 → 3846.60] Like I said,
[3846.82 → 3847.40] it's very,
[3847.82 → 3848.18] I,
[3848.18 → 3848.48] I,
[3848.60 → 3850.50] I believe we can get there.
[3850.78 → 3851.14] Um,
[3851.44 → 3852.78] but I don't expect it soon.
[3853.04 → 3853.70] That's all I'm saying.
[3854.14 → 3854.42] They got,
[3854.52 → 3855.64] they got a lot of stuff going on.
[3855.80 → 3856.92] There's a lot of moving parts in that,
[3857.00 → 3857.38] their lab.
[3859.16 → 3859.52] Yeah.
[3860.98 → 3861.34] Yeah.
[3861.34 → 3861.66] I'm,
[3861.74 → 3862.42] I'm excited,
[3862.60 → 3862.76] man.
[3862.82 → 3863.36] It's going to be,
[3863.44 → 3864.18] it's going to be awesome.
[3864.30 → 3866.46] I had someone ask in float plane chat today,
[3866.46 → 3869.32] if we would make content about cards,
[3869.32 → 3871.86] like pretty deep into their life cycle,
[3871.86 → 3873.46] talking about their performance on new drivers.
[3874.10 → 3874.44] And I was like,
[3875.00 → 3878.56] I don't think that that's something that you're going to see very often.
[3878.56 → 3881.06] I don't think the content on LTT,
[3881.06 → 3886.58] but I think that's something where the lab could end up digging,
[3886.58 → 3886.86] you know,
[3886.86 → 3887.98] cool outliers.
[3888.78 → 3888.86] Like,
[3889.86 → 3890.18] man,
[3890.30 → 3890.46] how,
[3890.54 → 3892.56] how would we train it to look for,
[3892.56 → 3893.72] you know,
[3893.78 → 3895.80] weird anomalies?
[3896.28 → 3896.64] Like,
[3896.76 → 3897.20] you know,
[3897.28 → 3897.44] Hey,
[3897.60 → 3898.52] flag it for us.
[3898.52 → 3902.08] If this card has increased in performance by more than 20%.
[3902.08 → 3903.68] If we've tested it in the past.
[3903.78 → 3904.08] Yeah.
[3905.16 → 3909.56] That would help a lot because then if a test is like way outside expected
[3909.56 → 3910.26] change,
[3910.38 → 3911.20] then we would know.
[3911.86 → 3912.26] Yeah,
[3912.28 → 3912.86] I guess so.
[3913.82 → 3916.46] And we're going to have like weekly meetings with the lab that kind
[3916.46 → 3916.78] of like,
[3916.88 → 3917.14] okay,
[3917.14 → 3917.80] what have you tested?
[3917.92 → 3918.06] What,
[3918.18 → 3918.84] what's interesting?
[3919.64 → 3920.04] Um,
[3920.16 → 3923.24] I had a meeting with James today about sort of what are,
[3923.40 → 3925.26] what are channel strategy?
[3925.26 → 3927.66] is going to look like going forward.
[3928.10 → 3929.24] And it's,
[3929.28 → 3929.56] it's,
[3929.64 → 3930.40] it's kind of like,
[3930.42 → 3930.90] um,
[3931.68 → 3934.38] content kind of rolls down a hill sort of thing.
[3934.62 → 3937.44] So LTT started out as simple,
[3937.58 → 3938.02] basic,
[3938.02 → 3940.88] like reading the packaging unboxing essentially.
[3941.28 → 3945.12] And then it turned into more like testing and reviews.
[3945.12 → 3949.12] And then it turned into bigger projects and became very personality
[3949.12 → 3949.52] driven.
[3949.52 → 3952.56] And now it's sort of reached a show.
[3952.74 → 3953.02] Yeah.
[3953.04 → 3953.72] I would say it's,
[3953.72 → 3956.16] it's reached kind of an end game as far as that goes.
[3956.28 → 3961.80] And then we identified that there was this content gap that we were no longer
[3961.80 → 3962.16] filling.
[3962.40 → 3962.96] And we went,
[3963.02 → 3963.14] oh,
[3963.20 → 3963.38] okay.
[3963.40 → 3964.56] How about short circuit then?
[3964.88 → 3965.06] Uh,
[3965.06 → 3966.64] short circuit will now do the
[3966.68 → 3967.22] the simple,
[3967.40 → 3967.74] easy,
[3967.90 → 3968.74] cheapo unbox.
[3968.74 → 3969.06] Okay.
[3969.06 → 3969.34] Nope.
[3969.34 → 3971.12] We're going to start adding data to short circuit.
[3971.24 → 3972.76] Let's make that more like a review.
[3973.06 → 3973.44] Okay.
[3973.44 → 3975.46] But then what about these simple unboxing?
[3975.54 → 3975.70] Well,
[3975.74 → 3976.18] you know what?
[3976.22 → 3977.66] We're going to have data for those too.
[3977.72 → 3980.10] And then we're going to do these category specific channels.
[3980.10 → 3987.44] I think you guys might be disappointed when you see the production values of these.
[3987.54 → 3987.90] Oh yeah.
[3987.90 → 3991.20] If we're making a video on every single power supply that ever exists.
[3991.36 → 3993.60] It might just be hands unboxing,
[3994.38 → 3996.00] some very basic B roll.
[3996.16 → 4001.88] We might have to find a way to essentially cut these with AI and then have an editor go
[4001.88 → 4002.46] in and fix.
[4002.46 → 4004.56] There are AI video editing tools.
[4004.90 → 4007.46] Like it might be pretty basic,
[4008.18 → 4009.06] but if our,
[4009.18 → 4010.82] if our goal is to,
[4010.82 → 4011.18] you know,
[4011.82 → 4016.84] have a video that could belong on every single product page on New egg or something like that in the longer term here,
[4018.02 → 4019.36] realistically,
[4019.92 → 4020.32] how,
[4020.44 → 4021.36] how much,
[4021.64 → 4022.12] um,
[4022.58 → 4026.06] how much more is there going to be for us to say about the 13,
[4026.24 → 4028.88] 500 or the 13,
[4029.08 → 4031.14] 400 core I five?
[4032.46 → 4034.52] I,
[4034.74 → 4035.14] man,
[4035.20 → 4041.38] I'm going to be really interested to see what we'll be able to do with a labs data sheet,
[4041.54 → 4043.38] a large language model,
[4043.38 → 4046.98] and a writer to kind of go in and clean it up.
[4047.06 → 4047.82] It's going to need that.
[4048.12 → 4048.24] Yeah.
[4048.30 → 4048.78] Um,
[4049.96 → 4051.34] where we basically just go,
[4051.46 → 4051.86] okay,
[4052.14 → 4053.92] feed the LLM,
[4054.12 → 4062.36] all the performance data and specs of this product and everything within $50 of it,
[4062.36 → 4063.46] on either side.
[4064.24 → 4064.72] And,
[4064.94 → 4065.84] uh,
[4065.90 → 4066.14] you know,
[4066.14 → 4067.76] the top tier from that generation.
[4068.86 → 4070.12] What would it spit out?
[4070.26 → 4072.68] Would it say compared to AMD's,
[4072.74 → 4073.04] whatever,
[4073.24 → 4074.40] it's like this,
[4074.40 → 4079.44] and that's still 30% worse than the best Intel has to offer.
[4079.44 → 4079.94] But it,
[4080.30 → 4080.92] like if we,
[4081.04 → 4083.04] if we gave it enough samples,
[4083.04 → 4086.90] like if we wrote them manually to start and then fed that to it,
[4086.90 → 4087.86] would it be able to,
[4087.86 → 4088.14] uh,
[4088.56 → 4089.84] to generate anything usable?
[4089.96 → 4090.78] I don't even know.
[4091.16 → 4094.72] What could be kind of interesting is eventually if we have like site analytic,
[4094.72 → 4095.90] like user,
[4096.44 → 4100.12] how people use the labs website analytics that are good,
[4100.12 → 4102.68] we could use that to fuel content direction.
[4103.28 → 4107.80] Like if we start noticing a ton of people start comparing some certain cards or whatever,
[4108.72 → 4109.22] we could be like,
[4109.24 → 4110.38] maybe content time.
[4110.94 → 4112.12] That's pretty cool.
[4112.34 → 4113.18] I do stuff like that.
[4113.44 → 4113.80] Okay.
[4113.88 → 4114.72] I'm liking that.
[4115.62 → 4116.30] Not yet.
[4116.42 → 4116.76] Not yet.
[4117.30 → 4118.20] It's going to take time.
[4118.38 → 4118.58] Yeah.
[4118.76 → 4119.16] That's fine.
[4119.22 → 4119.82] We've got time.
[4119.90 → 4120.50] We've got money.

[4211.76 → 4212.96] The show is also brought to you by,
[4213.10 → 4213.24] oh,
[4213.30 → 4214.52] this is a super cool monitor.
[4215.12 → 4217.30] I am actually considering,
[4217.48 → 4217.64] okay,
[4217.68 → 4219.02] I'll read the talking points at some point,
[4219.10 → 4224.62] but I'm pretty close to swapping out my 120 hertz 16x9 for this thing at home.
[4224.62 → 4228.52] I've had it on my test bench in the garage ever since we did the review.
[4229.50 → 4231.70] And every time I'm out there,
[4231.76 → 4232.26] I'm just like,
[4232.32 → 4233.00] yeah,
[4233.00 → 4233.96] I should just bring this inside.
[4234.54 → 4236.60] And it's dumb little things.
[4237.58 → 4237.94] Like,
[4238.10 → 4238.32] okay,
[4238.42 → 4238.84] it's some dumb,
[4238.88 → 4239.78] not dumb little things.
[4239.96 → 4241.92] Being able to adjust the angle is super cool.
[4243.24 → 4245.74] It's 240 hertz instead of 120,
[4245.94 → 4246.90] like the one that I'm using,
[4247.00 → 4248.24] or it's either 120 or 144.
[4248.88 → 4249.24] Anyway,
[4249.30 → 4250.14] it's a little smoother.
[4250.14 → 4255.18] And a big one is that it would mean that if I want to start streaming again more regularly,
[4255.50 → 4258.06] my camera could be in a way better position.
[4258.98 → 4259.78] A big,
[4259.86 → 4264.14] big 16x9 monitor is actually not that great for webcam positioning.
[4264.36 → 4264.48] Yeah.
[4264.80 → 4265.16] Anyway,
[4265.36 → 4265.52] sorry,
[4265.60 → 4266.26] talking points,
[4266.52 → 4266.66] blah,
[4266.72 → 4266.94] blah,
[4267.20 → 4268.22] 45 inch,
[4268.72 → 4269.88] a thousand nit peak brightness,
[4270.94 → 4273.04] three-year warranty with burn in protection.
[4273.46 → 4276.12] And you can check it out at the link in the video description.
[4277.86 → 4278.30] Okay.
[4278.30 → 4279.64] That's not creepy at all.
[4280.58 → 4280.98] Cool.
[4283.30 → 4284.24] Oh my goodness.
[4285.20 → 4285.58] Hey,
[4285.66 → 4285.90] Dan,
[4285.98 → 4286.50] I'm happy.
[4286.66 → 4286.74] Hey,
[4286.76 → 4286.94] Dan,
[4287.02 → 4287.62] spots are back.
[4287.70 → 4287.82] Hey,
[4287.86 → 4288.12] Dan,
[4288.36 → 4289.92] we don't know what to do.
[4290.24 → 4291.00] Tell us what to do.
[4291.20 → 4292.02] Tell us what to do.
[4292.24 → 4293.22] Three many messages.
[4293.82 → 4294.22] Okay.
[4294.30 → 4295.82] Well then why didn't you just read a merch message?
[4296.52 → 4296.88] Dan.
[4297.22 → 4297.56] Yeah.
[4298.68 → 4301.38] It's going to be less effective trying to yell at him when we're in Taiwan.
[4301.70 → 4302.02] Yeah,
[4302.04 → 4302.54] that's true.
[4302.84 → 4303.16] Oh yeah.
[4303.24 → 4305.68] We're going to next week is going to be the Taiwan show.
[4308.74 → 4309.98] Why did I think of that?
[4310.14 → 4312.66] Oh yeah.
[4312.76 → 4313.02] Okay,
[4313.02 → 4313.38] fine.
[4313.48 → 4315.86] We'll do some merch messages if you insist.
[4318.66 → 4319.06] Okay.
[4319.06 → 4319.18] Okay.
[4319.80 → 4321.90] Another Dan has a question for the talent.
[4321.90 → 4323.78] LTX is coming soon.
[4323.78 → 4324.74] And with the whale LAN,
[4324.88 → 4328.00] I would like to hear your tips for travelling with LAN gear.
[4328.82 → 4329.58] Oh man.
[4329.62 → 4330.60] Take the GPU out.
[4330.72 → 4330.96] Yeah.
[4331.10 → 4331.86] Take the GPU out.
[4332.08 → 4332.56] Never,
[4332.82 → 4336.12] never put your tower down below if you can avoid it.
[4336.12 → 4339.04] It's a strong argument for,
[4339.20 → 4339.38] yeah,
[4339.50 → 4340.64] like in the luggage check.
[4341.14 → 4342.16] Like if you can,
[4342.24 → 4345.68] if you can small form factor it and bring your computer with you,
[4345.80 → 4346.26] man,
[4346.38 → 4346.94] I would try.
[4346.94 → 4347.60] I didn't think about flying.
[4347.74 → 4349.12] But at the very least,
[4349.74 → 4351.90] take your GPU out of the system,
[4352.40 → 4353.22] pack it up with stuff.
[4353.76 → 4354.82] We did a video.
[4355.88 → 4357.42] I forgot about this.
[4360.24 → 4360.68] Linus,
[4360.78 → 4362.50] how to pack your PC.
[4363.58 → 4364.00] Here,
[4364.08 → 4364.72] hold on a second.
[4365.72 → 4367.52] How to not smash your PC.
[4367.92 → 4368.56] Gaming rig,
[4368.64 → 4369.68] packing and moving guide.
[4370.06 → 4370.70] This was,
[4371.02 → 4373.82] this must've been more than three years ago.
[4373.92 → 4374.28] Hold on.
[4374.40 → 4375.72] Just a gosh darn second here.
[4375.78 → 4376.80] What's the exact date on this?
[4377.18 → 4377.42] Yeah.
[4377.64 → 4378.30] July 1st,
[4378.32 → 4378.74] 2019.
[4378.74 → 4380.74] This was in the lead up to LTX.
[4381.46 → 4382.40] The last time we did it.
[4382.44 → 4382.88] Look at this hair.
[4385.02 → 4388.26] And the whole idea was that we were going to be doing a big LAN and we
[4388.26 → 4389.88] wanted people's computers to make it safely.
[4390.00 → 4393.02] So we show you guys all these ways that you can pack up your computer
[4393.02 → 4393.40] safely.
[4394.46 → 4394.94] Oh yeah.
[4395.00 → 4395.90] This stuff is perfect.
[4396.00 → 4396.20] Yeah.
[4396.26 → 4396.44] Yeah.
[4396.44 → 4396.64] Yeah.
[4397.22 → 4397.44] Yeah.
[4397.44 → 4398.00] So that's a
[4398.02 → 4400.78] that's a whole video that only got a million views,
[4400.78 → 4401.92] but Hey,
[4401.98 → 4406.94] I think we just got a nice little bump from the 500 people who are coming
[4406.94 → 4407.54] to whale land.
[4407.70 → 4408.18] Yay.
[4408.52 → 4409.22] Small bump.
[4409.64 → 4409.92] Yes.
[4410.26 → 4410.54] All right.
[4410.66 → 4410.88] Hit me,
[4410.94 → 4411.02] Dan.
[4412.06 → 4415.96] DLL with how much you guys work when show lasting four to five hours.
[4416.12 → 4419.70] How do you manage a good work slash family balance?
[4421.30 → 4421.74] Um,
[4424.20 → 4424.54] well,
[4424.54 → 4431.20] I'm supposed to be home already so that I can spend a bit of time with my
[4431.20 → 4431.64] wife,
[4431.64 → 4432.08] um,
[4432.08 → 4433.40] before I go to the airport.
[4433.58 → 4434.56] What time's our flight?
[4435.54 → 4436.08] 2 AM.
[4436.48 → 4437.08] 2 AM.
[4437.32 → 4439.16] So I fly out in six hours.
[4439.16 → 4440.44] It takes quite a while to get there.
[4440.62 → 4441.00] Um,
[4441.44 → 4442.54] it's been a challenge.
[4442.88 → 4443.24] Yep.
[4443.46 → 4443.90] Uh,
[4443.94 → 4444.24] but,
[4444.70 → 4447.14] but I schedule time for family.
[4447.52 → 4448.04] Uh,
[4448.04 → 4448.76] so every,
[4448.96 → 4450.26] every week I,
[4450.74 → 4451.32] um,
[4451.46 → 4454.70] I go to my daughter's martial arts class with them.
[4454.70 → 4456.38] So I help participate in the class.
[4457.10 → 4457.50] Um,
[4457.90 → 4460.44] also I do badminton training with my kids.
[4460.44 → 4460.98] Like I,
[4461.18 → 4462.10] I'll play with them.
[4462.72 → 4463.12] Um,
[4463.32 → 4463.54] you know,
[4463.56 → 4466.76] whether it's like family game night or board games or movie night or
[4466.76 → 4467.42] whatever else,
[4467.48 → 4467.60] you know,
[4467.60 → 4470.48] we make sure that we do those things at least a couple of times a week.
[4470.54 → 4471.60] We went swimming on the weekend.
[4471.78 → 4473.18] Like you just have to schedule it.
[4473.22 → 4473.84] I think is,
[4473.98 → 4476.56] is the typical response you'll hear from busy people.
[4476.96 → 4477.94] Get it on the schedule.
[4478.54 → 4478.86] Um,
[4479.74 → 4483.48] and the funny thing about it is that like my parents were super busy,
[4483.48 → 4486.04] but I didn't really think about it until I became a parent.
[4486.70 → 4487.26] Like you,
[4487.34 → 4488.22] you remember like,
[4488.30 → 4488.64] Oh yeah,
[4488.66 → 4489.76] we would go to,
[4489.76 → 4490.54] you know,
[4490.92 → 4493.48] play land, or we would do this, or we would do that.
[4493.50 → 4494.22] And you think back, and you're going,
[4494.22 → 4494.38] yeah,
[4494.42 → 4495.48] we did that like four times.
[4496.08 → 4496.12] Um,
[4496.16 → 4497.30] like kids' memories are funny.
[4497.38 → 4497.58] And I,
[4497.66 → 4500.02] I think my kids think I spend a lot of time with them, actually.
[4500.02 → 4500.64] So it's,
[4500.78 → 4501.18] it's good.
[4503.08 → 4503.54] You know,
[4503.58 → 4504.30] bedtime stories,
[4504.40 → 4507.48] making sure that you kind of catch them at least once a day and,
[4507.52 → 4508.44] and do something with them.
[4508.44 → 4509.64] I think it's really important.
[4511.00 → 4512.76] My life is a lot easier.
[4512.86 → 4513.86] Don't have kids.
[4514.00 → 4514.58] I do.
[4514.74 → 4518.30] I am hoping to have some amount of time at home though.
[4518.30 → 4520.04] Cause my birds have been away all week.
[4520.10 → 4521.48] Have I told you this at all?
[4522.00 → 4522.36] Okay.
[4522.36 → 4525.16] So when I was in Houston doing one of the coolest things I've ever done in my
[4525.16 → 4525.72] darn life,
[4525.82 → 4526.42] um,
[4526.74 → 4527.08] uh,
[4527.08 → 4528.98] we boarded the birds at the vet.
[4528.98 → 4534.08] It's pretty common for people to board their birds at vets when they go
[4534.08 → 4534.42] away.
[4534.50 → 4537.74] Is it common for the vet to not bother taking care of their birds at all?
[4537.90 → 4538.34] Yeah.
[4538.50 → 4538.86] Uh,
[4538.86 → 4540.90] so there's a continuation of that story.
[4541.38 → 4541.68] Oh,
[4541.84 → 4542.92] they have mites.
[4543.60 → 4545.10] Your birds have mites.
[4545.10 → 4545.96] That they got.
[4546.44 → 4547.12] Are you sure?
[4547.36 → 4548.10] At the vet.
[4549.48 → 4549.96] Okay.
[4549.96 → 4550.84] I shouldn't joke.
[4551.80 → 4552.04] I mean,
[4552.12 → 4553.12] I'm too pissed to find it funny.
[4553.18 → 4553.78] It was pretty good,
[4553.94 → 4554.34] but I'm,
[4554.34 → 4555.62] I'm very angry right now.
[4555.62 → 4556.08] So it didn't,
[4556.08 → 4556.88] it didn't seriously.
[4556.88 → 4558.00] They have vet mites.
[4558.32 → 4558.70] Yeah.
[4558.80 → 4561.78] So we contacted the vet, and they were like,
[4561.86 → 4562.48] Oh yeah.
[4562.60 → 4567.04] So we had our second infestation of mites ever in our like entire history.
[4567.04 → 4567.86] And they're there.
[4567.98 → 4569.24] They've been around for a very long time.
[4569.48 → 4569.72] Yeah.
[4569.76 → 4570.06] Um,
[4570.06 → 4573.20] this is like the worst ever and things are bad.
[4573.56 → 4574.88] Bring them back, and we'll take care of them.
[4575.24 → 4575.64] Uh,
[4575.72 → 4576.44] scoop.
[4576.62 → 4577.70] The blue and white one,
[4577.78 → 4578.36] uh,
[4578.36 → 4580.98] was anemic and birds are,
[4581.08 → 4581.22] you know,
[4581.28 → 4582.78] humans are like mostly water birds,
[4582.88 → 4583.50] mostly air.
[4583.60 → 4585.06] They have like no mass to them.
[4585.10 → 4585.38] Right.
[4585.56 → 4587.20] So if it's anemic,
[4587.90 → 4588.60] that's terrible,
[4588.68 → 4589.44] real bad.
[4589.78 → 4591.78] So they took such good care of your birds last time.
[4591.78 → 4592.06] So,
[4592.14 → 4593.10] so big concern.
[4593.52 → 4593.92] Uh,
[4593.92 → 4594.54] and they're,
[4594.66 → 4596.98] they're probably home right now,
[4596.98 → 4597.66] actually.
[4597.94 → 4600.90] So I'm hoping to see them for some amount of time before we leave.
[4602.02 → 4608.34] Because I am big squishy man that wants to see little tiny born before I go away for two weeks.
[4609.36 → 4610.40] You're a good bird dad.
[4613.08 → 4613.48] Yeah.
[4613.74 → 4617.58] I don't think I could be as attached to a bird as you seem to be to your birds.
[4617.58 → 4618.52] I don't have kids.
[4618.90 → 4619.18] Yeah.
[4619.34 → 4619.54] Well,
[4619.66 → 4620.98] it's one of those things where,
[4621.12 → 4621.90] oh boy,
[4622.08 → 4622.62] this is,
[4622.88 → 4623.06] oh,
[4623.08 → 4624.00] this is going to be a hot day.
[4624.00 → 4625.30] We should do the next merch message.
[4625.50 → 4626.34] As a parent,
[4626.80 → 4628.18] I often hear people,
[4628.54 → 4628.92] you know,
[4629.20 → 4630.10] like dog people.
[4630.10 → 4630.40] Oh yeah.
[4630.54 → 4630.62] No,
[4630.62 → 4630.96] it's not.
[4630.96 → 4633.76] People talk about how much it's like kids.
[4633.84 → 4634.18] Oh no.
[4634.28 → 4635.04] And I'm just like,
[4635.96 → 4636.36] nope.
[4637.10 → 4637.82] It's an animal.
[4638.22 → 4638.34] Yeah.
[4638.36 → 4640.84] You feel that way because you don't have kids.
[4641.52 → 4644.74] Like I thought I loved cats a lot.
[4645.26 → 4645.90] And like,
[4645.98 → 4646.92] now I'm like,
[4647.46 → 4647.72] oh,
[4648.36 → 4648.92] no,
[4648.96 → 4649.70] it's just a cat.
[4650.32 → 4650.72] Okay.
[4650.98 → 4651.48] I mean,
[4651.48 → 4652.48] I like my cats.
[4653.12 → 4654.44] And you can care about them a lot.
[4654.44 → 4655.32] Maybe love them a little,
[4655.60 → 4656.72] but it's,
[4656.78 → 4657.92] it's not the same.
[4658.22 → 4660.50] Emma and I actually have this conversation like often.
[4661.18 → 4661.88] And I'm like,
[4661.94 → 4662.12] no,
[4662.20 → 4662.84] like they're cool.
[4662.84 → 4663.86] I care about them a lot.
[4664.26 → 4665.54] I will do a lot for them.
[4665.62 → 4669.92] But you only have that much energy for your dog because,
[4670.38 → 4672.82] yeah,
[4672.94 → 4673.10] no,
[4673.10 → 4673.86] it's just a dog.
[4674.02 → 4674.60] I'm sorry.
[4674.84 → 4675.06] Yeah.
[4675.28 → 4676.68] And like dogs are cool.
[4676.92 → 4677.16] Right.
[4677.48 → 4678.08] Super cool.
[4678.28 → 4679.12] My birds are fantastic.
[4679.32 → 4679.52] Yep.
[4679.80 → 4680.68] Love my cats.
[4682.68 → 4683.08] But.
[4683.78 → 4684.74] And we went through a lot.
[4684.82 → 4685.00] Okay.
[4685.18 → 4685.70] Here's the
[4685.78 → 4686.48] here's the fun part.
[4686.54 → 4688.02] You'll know how much I liked doing this.
[4688.26 → 4688.64] Uh,
[4688.82 → 4691.20] they sent us this huge PDF about like,
[4691.28 → 4691.60] okay,
[4691.60 → 4692.70] so you had mites.
[4693.34 → 4693.70] Um,
[4693.74 → 4695.68] because now we had mites in our house.
[4695.68 → 4696.04] Right.
[4696.14 → 4697.30] And we found them.
[4697.30 → 4699.72] My girlfriend found them because they were crawling on the blanket.
[4701.28 → 4701.98] So it's not,
[4702.04 → 4702.34] they weren't,
[4702.42 → 4703.40] they're not just on the birds.
[4703.46 → 4704.42] They're not just in the cage.
[4704.72 → 4706.04] They are now in our house.
[4707.04 → 4707.76] So it's like,
[4707.80 → 4709.28] this is how you deal with things.
[4709.28 → 4710.30] Now that you have mites in your house.
[4710.30 → 4710.74] And they're like,
[4710.76 → 4714.18] you will effectively never get rid of this infestation.
[4714.40 → 4714.76] Blah,
[4714.78 → 4714.86] blah,
[4714.86 → 4714.98] blah,
[4714.98 → 4715.08] blah,
[4715.08 → 4715.24] blah,
[4715.24 → 4715.48] blah,
[4715.48 → 4715.58] blah,
[4715.58 → 4715.74] blah.
[4715.84 → 4720.78] Some of the reasons why are they'll get into like your couch, and you can't get them out of your couch.
[4721.82 → 4722.38] Guess what?
[4722.38 → 4723.82] My response was,
[4723.98 → 4725.44] let's see how well,
[4725.98 → 4727.66] Linus can usually pin me pretty well,
[4727.74 → 4728.82] but this one was interesting.
[4728.96 → 4729.42] So we'll see.
[4730.18 → 4731.50] To get rid of mites.
[4733.98 → 4734.42] Arson.
[4735.44 → 4735.88] Um,
[4735.90 → 4737.56] because you can't get it out of certain things.
[4737.64 → 4738.32] So like,
[4738.44 → 4738.54] well,
[4738.58 → 4738.72] yeah,
[4738.76 → 4741.22] my computer chair is right next to the cage.
[4741.32 → 4741.74] They say,
[4741.80 → 4743.32] they sit literally right here.
[4743.40 → 4746.16] The couch is literally right on the other side of that.
[4746.24 → 4747.74] The solution to this.
[4747.80 → 4749.90] There's a carpet that was right beside them as well.
[4750.02 → 4750.20] I mean,
[4750.50 → 4750.82] no,
[4750.82 → 4752.88] you have to just hauled it out immediately.
[4753.40 → 4753.64] Yep.
[4753.84 → 4754.12] Yeah.
[4754.32 → 4754.44] No,
[4754.54 → 4755.64] there's my couch,
[4755.72 → 4757.46] my computer chair and my giant carpet.
[4757.66 → 4758.18] Thanks vet.
[4758.54 → 4759.18] So my house,
[4759.26 → 4761.08] you walk into my house and it echoes now.
[4761.44 → 4761.80] Right.
[4761.80 → 4769.78] Like I actually yeeted like half of the furniture that I own, and I'm going to leave on this trip and come back and have no computer chair.
[4770.66 → 4771.04] Sick.
[4771.32 → 4772.68] I have like a dining room chair.
[4772.76 → 4773.38] Like I'll be fine.
[4773.48 → 4773.80] But like,
[4773.80 → 4776.44] what a pain in the butt.
[4776.52 → 4777.70] Oh my God.
[4777.70 → 4778.76] I'm so annoyed.
[4778.86 → 4779.30] Anyway.
[4780.92 → 4781.36] Ah,
[4781.56 → 4782.08] good one.
[4782.74 → 4783.14] Okay.
[4783.24 → 4783.62] I get a
[4783.62 → 4785.34] I get a courtesy chuckle for that one.
[4786.92 → 4787.78] This is great.
[4788.00 → 4788.80] Can't believe the vet didn't tell you,
[4789.04 → 4789.38] bro,
[4789.78 → 4790.38] bro.
[4790.56 → 4790.74] I,
[4790.84 → 4791.08] I'm,
[4791.34 → 4791.94] I think,
[4792.04 → 4794.44] I think I'm going to start implementing my shadow-banning.
[4795.00 → 4795.34] Uh,
[4795.40 → 4795.74] got a
[4795.74 → 4796.82] got a Twitch message.
[4797.24 → 4800.08] Loving a self reproduction of yourself is the height of hubris.
[4800.08 → 4804.40] That is actually not what a kid is.
[4805.74 → 4807.34] You're an f***ING idiot.
[4807.72 → 4809.08] Miniature Linus clones.
[4809.98 → 4810.92] Like actually,
[4811.58 → 4813.66] like actually your brain is bad.
[4815.24 → 4815.84] Oh.
[4817.32 → 4818.10] It's like,
[4818.34 → 4822.54] you can't have that bad of a take because your,
[4822.70 → 4827.58] your brain couldn't possibly get there from a place of being remotely functional.
[4828.10 → 4828.62] Um,
[4828.62 → 4831.20] without it actually being real.
[4831.50 → 4832.18] Like that's,
[4832.24 → 4833.48] that's kind of how it works.
[4837.64 → 4838.72] Oh my God.
[4843.78 → 4844.84] Next Twitch message.
[4844.98 → 4845.66] Is that how many more?
[4845.68 → 4845.92] Please,
[4845.92 → 4848.70] please move on, or we will not have enough.
[4848.70 → 4849.62] You got 10 minutes.
[4849.74 → 4849.86] Yeah.
[4849.86 → 4850.48] Hit me again.
[4850.58 → 4850.70] Uh,
[4850.78 → 4851.18] eight sleep.
[4851.26 → 4852.00] Should we talk about that?
[4853.10 → 4853.42] Yeah.
[4853.50 → 4854.36] We got to talk about it at some point.
[4854.36 → 4858.18] Some viewers were upset that eight sleep who sponsored a video last week
[4858.18 → 4860.08] requires a mandatory subscription.
[4860.34 → 4861.72] I do want to put an asterisk on here.
[4861.72 → 4864.32] Because I've talked about eight sleep on the show a few times about how I've won
[4864.32 → 4865.20] and how I like it a lot.
[4865.50 → 4868.66] I'm 99.9% sure it was not a mandatory.
[4868.78 → 4869.06] No,
[4869.06 → 4869.94] we can talk about that.
[4870.04 → 4870.40] It is.
[4870.52 → 4870.92] Oh yeah.
[4871.02 → 4871.18] No,
[4871.22 → 4872.92] when I bought mine back then.
[4872.92 → 4873.44] So,
[4873.44 → 4874.02] uh,
[4874.04 → 4878.52] it requires a mandatory subscription for at least a year to their premium
[4878.52 → 4878.92] features.
[4878.92 → 4879.96] And it's really expensive.
[4879.96 → 4880.68] Just as a note,
[4880.68 → 4881.24] uh,
[4881.24 → 4884.42] to their premium features with the purchase of their temperature controlled,
[4884.42 → 4885.10] uh,
[4885.14 → 4885.76] mattress topper,
[4885.76 → 4886.54] the product,
[4886.68 → 4887.86] super basic feature,
[4887.86 → 4889.86] uh,
[4889.90 → 4892.22] heating slash cooling works without the subscription.
[4892.42 → 4895.76] There's nothing forcing users to continue to buy it after the first year.
[4895.76 → 4897.40] At our request,
[4897.70 → 4902.74] eight sleep has agreed to double their discount offer from 150 to $300 to cover
[4902.74 → 4903.70] the cost of subscription.
[4904.02 → 4907.36] And we've let them know that we won't be working with them moving forward
[4907.36 → 4911.58] unless they make changes to their subscription model and commit to an open
[4911.58 → 4912.42] source transition.
[4912.62 → 4914.54] Should the company go out of business.
[4915.06 → 4917.24] Hopefully that helps address things with you guys.
[4917.36 → 4918.32] I got to be honest with you.
[4918.40 → 4923.46] The reason that I didn't know this was a problem is because I'm using my eight
[4923.46 → 4925.44] sleep topper without a subscription.
[4925.44 → 4930.68] Because I looked at the features of the subscription and what I wanted it for.
[4930.68 → 4931.46] And I went,
[4931.52 → 4932.20] eh,
[4932.88 → 4933.76] not really worth it.
[4933.86 → 4935.48] And it was optional back then.
[4935.70 → 4939.64] And I didn't realize that you had to buy the year of subscription.
[4939.88 → 4940.20] Honestly,
[4940.38 → 4942.20] I think they could have just messaged this better.
[4942.48 → 4947.28] If the price was just higher, and it included the first year of subscription.
[4947.28 → 4948.14] Included free bonus.
[4948.28 → 4949.68] Like that's exactly.
[4950.36 → 4951.84] Then I don't think anybody would have,
[4952.10 → 4953.70] the people would have said it was expensive,
[4953.70 → 4959.34] but they wouldn't have called it evil or predatory or whatever else.
[4959.78 → 4960.02] Um,
[4960.10 → 4960.38] so anyway,
[4960.38 → 4962.04] it is really expensive with,
[4962.04 → 4962.42] without,
[4962.58 → 4963.64] with or without the subscription,
[4963.76 → 4964.80] whatever it is very expensive.
[4964.92 → 4965.06] Yeah.
[4965.10 → 4966.26] It's very expensive.
[4966.48 → 4966.66] Yeah.
[4966.66 → 4968.20] but Hey,
[4968.48 → 4973.50] thanks eight sleep for dealing with it in terms of how the discount code works.
[4973.50 → 4974.32] It's cool that they did that.
[4974.48 → 4974.62] Um,
[4974.62 → 4980.94] and hopefully these guys will make a commitment to ensure that these things don't turn into,
[4980.94 → 4981.84] you know,
[4981.84 → 4985.24] just 35 pounds of just e-waste.
[4985.58 → 4985.96] Um,
[4985.96 → 4988.38] if the company were to ever go out of business,
[4988.38 → 4988.94] with that said,
[4988.98 → 4990.42] given how much their subscription costs,
[4990.44 → 4992.50] I think it'd be a real challenge for them to go out of business.
[4992.92 → 4993.30] Um,
[4993.40 → 4995.70] but as expensive as it is,
[4995.70 → 4996.74] like,
[4996.74 → 5002.16] I like the product and a lot of people were posting misinformation too,
[5002.24 → 5002.32] though.
[5002.38 → 5004.04] They were saying that without the subscription,
[5004.18 → 5005.16] you can't use the app.
[5005.54 → 5006.74] That is not true.
[5006.84 → 5007.34] That's correct.
[5007.54 → 5007.84] Um,
[5007.92 → 5009.00] I do not have,
[5009.00 → 5010.26] it just doesn't do autopilot,
[5010.34 → 5011.94] which is the auto adjusting feature,
[5011.94 → 5012.18] right?
[5012.40 → 5013.72] I don't have a subscription.
[5014.06 → 5015.28] My phone is almost dead.
[5015.28 → 5017.88] So you can barely see my battery saver screen or whatever,
[5017.88 → 5020.00] but this is my,
[5020.14 → 5021.18] this is my dashboard.
[5021.48 → 5022.12] That's rough.
[5022.24 → 5022.98] My temp dial,
[5023.50 → 5024.38] my temp dial.
[5024.38 → 5026.34] I get that almost every day as well.
[5026.34 → 5027.40] Definitely works.
[5027.82 → 5028.30] Oh,
[5028.42 → 5028.58] oh,
[5028.58 → 5029.02] my sleep.
[5029.02 → 5029.58] Pay attention.
[5029.92 → 5030.68] Score of 26.
[5031.26 → 5031.74] Yeah.
[5031.80 → 5032.16] Well,
[5033.06 → 5033.54] I mean,
[5034.00 → 5036.82] what do you want from me?
[5037.04 → 5037.22] I,
[5037.38 → 5037.84] yeah,
[5038.00 → 5039.42] I don't sleep well.
[5039.76 → 5040.02] Uh,
[5040.04 → 5040.78] but anyway,
[5041.18 → 5041.46] uh,
[5041.46 → 5041.60] yeah,
[5041.60 → 5045.36] my temp dial works, and it will adjust throughout the night,
[5045.36 → 5047.86] but it doesn't adjust based on my body temperature.
[5047.86 → 5050.42] So I just have to kind of dial it into what I like.
[5050.50 → 5055.30] And the challenge there is that if you are not in a temperature controlled space,
[5055.30 → 5056.16] like my,
[5056.28 → 5057.62] my house has climate control,
[5057.70 → 5057.98] right?
[5058.04 → 5059.80] If you're not in a temperature controlled space,
[5059.80 → 5062.36] then it could be a lot more important to have the automatic thing,
[5062.36 → 5065.56] but then presumably you aren't paying for climate control.
[5067.88 → 5072.86] So I see why people were upset and that's why we've gone to them and said,
[5072.92 → 5073.02] okay,
[5073.02 → 5073.22] look,
[5073.26 → 5074.26] here's our list of demands.
[5074.26 → 5074.90] Uh,
[5074.90 → 5077.14] but I also do see the value of the product.
[5077.14 → 5077.68] It's not,
[5077.68 → 5079.56] yeah.
[5079.56 → 5080.18] Oh,
[5080.22 → 5081.36] I've actually done pretty good lately.
[5081.44 → 5083.14] I've got you beat 74.
[5083.54 → 5083.90] That's,
[5083.90 → 5084.94] that's very good for me.
[5085.04 → 5085.26] Wow.
[5085.34 → 5085.78] Good job,
[5085.86 → 5086.06] Luke.
[5086.18 → 5086.62] Thank you.
[5086.76 → 5087.04] Uh,
[5087.04 → 5087.76] for the last,
[5087.94 → 5088.32] uh,
[5088.32 → 5089.68] for the last five days,
[5089.68 → 5092.18] I have a sleep score of 26,
[5092.66 → 5093.38] 41,
[5093.92 → 5094.42] 80,
[5094.70 → 5095.00] Oh,
[5095.20 → 5096.00] 37,
[5096.52 → 5097.38] 44.
[5097.84 → 5098.40] And,
[5098.50 → 5098.62] uh,
[5098.72 → 5099.38] I have a
[5099.42 → 5102.30] a full 100 from last Sunday.
[5103.30 → 5103.78] Um,
[5103.94 → 5105.20] yeah,
[5105.20 → 5106.72] that's pretty good.
[5108.20 → 5108.64] Man,
[5108.66 → 5110.96] I slept till like 1130 though.
[5111.26 → 5112.08] So that's,
[5112.38 → 5112.66] yeah,
[5112.66 → 5113.58] that explains that.
[5113.96 → 5114.36] Uh,
[5115.10 → 5115.36] my,
[5115.42 → 5116.80] my kids let me sleep in that day.
[5118.82 → 5120.08] What do you want to talk about next?
[5120.30 → 5120.66] Oh,
[5120.78 → 5121.04] right.
[5121.04 → 5125.30] We should also talk about that other sponsor snafu this week on tech quickie,
[5125.36 → 5128.74] where we had that sponsor that was like a
[5128.74 → 5130.22] like a neck cooler thing.
[5130.72 → 5130.78] Oh,
[5130.84 → 5131.56] I heard about this.
[5131.66 → 5131.96] Okay.
[5132.66 → 5133.76] I tried it.
[5133.76 → 5137.14] It's like kind of cool pun intended,
[5137.38 → 5139.84] but it's a Kickstarter,
[5139.96 → 5140.08] right?
[5140.08 → 5140.48] Or something.
[5140.62 → 5140.90] Yeah.
[5141.00 → 5143.62] So that I didn't know.
[5143.94 → 5144.38] Ah,
[5144.58 → 5145.02] um,
[5145.02 → 5147.52] so I've reiterated to the team,
[5147.62 → 5148.36] Hey,
[5148.38 → 5150.58] we can't really do Kickstarter Indiegogo stuff.
[5150.76 → 5151.32] However,
[5151.32 → 5154.52] the reason they let it through is not entirely stupid either.
[5154.78 → 5161.34] This is a company that basically uses crowdfunding campaigns as a marketing vehicle.
[5161.34 → 5162.16] So,
[5162.30 → 5163.04] you know how,
[5163.04 → 5167.40] even though we don't talk about products on Indiegogo or whatever,
[5167.40 → 5169.64] but I'm constantly covering IA neo.
[5170.72 → 5171.20] Well,
[5171.40 → 5171.58] they,
[5171.78 → 5174.04] their product development just happens anyway.
[5174.26 → 5174.52] Yes.
[5174.68 → 5175.54] And they use,
[5175.92 → 5176.02] it's kind of,
[5176.08 → 5177.28] it's almost like marketing at that point.
[5177.36 → 5186.60] So this company has also got a very similar history of just releasing products via crowdfunding campaign as a marketing vehicle.
[5186.60 → 5188.20] So that's why they made the call.
[5188.42 → 5189.74] But the issue here,
[5189.80 → 5192.70] I think was that there were a very random company,
[5192.70 → 5193.42] uh,
[5193.42 → 5199.42] that our viewers were not familiar with at all and therefore didn't have that trust built up at all.
[5199.54 → 5201.72] And so we got a fair amount of pushback on that.
[5201.78 → 5202.42] And rightly so.
[5202.72 → 5203.00] Uh,
[5203.00 → 5205.80] also the talking points were stupid.
[5206.08 → 5208.28] And I talked to the business team about that as well.
[5208.28 → 5211.44] Like one of the talking points was that the fan is AI controlled.
[5211.70 → 5212.68] And I'm like,
[5212.68 → 5214.74] if your fan is AI controlled,
[5214.84 → 5219.46] you did it wrong because you're powering an AI processor in your,
[5219.60 → 5228.80] in your like neck cooler that should probably be using that power for cooling your neck and just have a simple fan curve on it.
[5228.86 → 5229.08] Right.
[5229.08 → 5230.08] Um,
[5230.22 → 5230.66] so I,
[5230.66 → 5235.98] I talked to them about how we can't just take silly talking points at face value.
[5235.98 → 5240.96] We have to make sure that we are communicating things in a way that is representative of the actual product.
[5241.04 → 5242.14] What does the product do?
[5242.44 → 5244.26] It cools your neck.
[5244.36 → 5249.90] It kind of feels like having like a chilly water bottle around your neck like this.
[5250.38 → 5251.22] You know what?
[5251.92 → 5252.84] I like it.
[5254.02 → 5256.20] Is it going to be the difference between,
[5256.20 → 5256.72] you know,
[5256.72 → 5261.38] going out in 45 Celsius heat and being immediately comfortable?
[5261.62 → 5261.64] I think it's,
[5261.64 → 5262.86] I think it's fair if,
[5262.86 → 5265.52] if it's a company without a proven track record, and it's a
[5265.64 → 5269.34] it's a Kickstarter Indiegogo level pre-order.
[5269.80 → 5271.00] I think that part's fair.
[5271.06 → 5271.60] But like you said,
[5271.64 → 5272.48] you didn't know it was that.
[5272.64 → 5273.42] So I don't know.
[5273.54 → 5274.46] So yeah,
[5274.50 → 5274.74] I mean,
[5274.82 → 5275.12] I only,
[5275.34 → 5279.72] I only found out about this after it was already a controversy,
[5279.72 → 5280.70] but I think,
[5281.00 → 5281.56] you know what?
[5281.56 → 5283.56] Things like this are going to happen more and more,
[5283.56 → 5286.78] and I'm just going to have to kind of get used to it.
[5286.90 → 5288.06] As chief vision officer,
[5288.06 → 5291.10] I'm probably going to end up running damage control more often,
[5291.10 → 5292.38] as opposed to less often.
[5292.54 → 5297.58] If part of the goal here is for me to not be like hour by hour involved in
[5297.58 → 5299.52] absolutely everything that this company does.
[5299.52 → 5300.06] Because it's just,
[5300.12 → 5301.30] it's not possible anymore.
[5301.52 → 5301.88] Theoretically,
[5302.00 → 5303.28] hopefully we have less though.
[5303.28 → 5304.60] Like for a change,
[5305.04 → 5306.48] hold on.
[5306.54 → 5307.76] What were the two controversies?
[5307.88 → 5308.26] There was the
[5308.40 → 5308.58] okay.
[5308.60 → 5310.60] The eight sleep one I had something to do with,
[5310.68 → 5312.04] but I didn't know all the details.
[5312.32 → 5313.78] And to the business team's credit,
[5313.98 → 5316.86] they did tell me that there was some kind of controversy around the
[5316.86 → 5317.26] subscription.
[5317.56 → 5319.42] And I waved it away because I kind of went,
[5319.52 → 5319.60] well,
[5319.66 → 5319.78] yeah,
[5319.84 → 5320.18] but like,
[5320.20 → 5320.78] I don't know.
[5320.82 → 5321.82] I use it without the subscription.
[5321.92 → 5322.30] Who cares?
[5323.94 → 5324.30] Whoops.
[5324.60 → 5324.90] Right.
[5324.90 → 5327.96] But then this other one with the weird neck cooler thing,
[5328.06 → 5331.00] I actually didn't know anything about it until the whole thing was done.
[5331.00 → 5337.06] And I'm just going to have to like get used to it,
[5337.08 → 5337.48] I guess.
[5337.78 → 5337.90] Yeah.
[5338.96 → 5340.40] So we're going to make some mistakes.
[5340.56 → 5341.32] We had this conversation.
[5341.92 → 5344.42] Yvonne and I had this conversation today where she was talking about,
[5344.52 → 5345.14] uh,
[5345.14 → 5345.38] I was,
[5345.44 → 5346.10] I was talking about,
[5346.16 → 5346.68] uh,
[5346.68 → 5347.98] this thing that we're implementing and,
[5347.98 → 5349.48] and security issues around it.
[5349.50 → 5349.84] And like,
[5349.84 → 5352.82] who should be able to have what level of access to various things.
[5352.90 → 5353.06] Yeah.
[5353.06 → 5353.54] Um,
[5353.74 → 5360.00] and she was kind of just thinking out loud about how it's interesting.
[5360.00 → 5362.00] And in some ways difficult,
[5362.00 → 5363.04] but in some ways good,
[5363.12 → 5363.38] whatever,
[5363.38 → 5368.38] like just kind of thinking out loud about the idea that it's not always just
[5368.38 → 5372.04] Linus Yvonne run everything all the time anymore.
[5374.62 → 5375.32] It's weird.
[5375.56 → 5376.08] We can't.
[5376.20 → 5376.42] Yeah.
[5376.68 → 5377.54] It's not possible.
[5377.66 → 5377.82] Nope.
[5378.00 → 5378.36] It's like a
[5378.52 → 5380.44] like almost 120 people.
[5380.52 → 5382.04] We added like two more people on Monday.
[5382.54 → 5383.88] Like what?
[5384.20 → 5384.50] Yeah.
[5384.50 → 5385.50] The
[5385.50 → 5387.34] the Monday morning meeting,
[5387.42 → 5389.38] like always has a picture in it these days.
[5390.08 → 5390.84] Like always.
[5393.10 → 5393.50] Well,
[5393.52 → 5394.08] you're not helping.
[5394.36 → 5394.54] No.
[5395.06 → 5395.84] Mine were all pre-approved,
[5395.92 → 5395.98] bro.
[5396.22 → 5398.00] Mine were all pre-approved like last year.
[5400.24 → 5401.46] I don't deny it.
[5402.88 → 5405.06] Should we talk about the invisible PC setup?
[5406.50 → 5406.92] Uh,
[5407.00 → 5407.48] yes.
[5407.84 → 5408.20] Yes.
[5408.20 → 5411.62] Invisible mouse,
[5412.58 → 5413.52] invisible keyboard,
[5414.32 → 5415.30] hologram monitor.
[5417.62 → 5420.02] This channel is actually amazing.
[5420.32 → 5421.90] This is the only thing I've seen,
[5422.02 → 5423.28] but it was awesome.
[5423.60 → 5423.88] And I,
[5424.16 → 5424.60] Oh no,
[5424.62 → 5426.36] he did this like super tiny one too,
[5426.42 → 5428.40] and specifically called me out to beat it.
[5428.64 → 5429.32] And I was like,
[5429.38 → 5430.16] I can't.
[5430.22 → 5431.10] What am I going to do?
[5431.18 → 5434.20] You've taken this to completely the end game.
[5434.20 → 5434.84] It's too far.
[5436.70 → 5437.14] Um,
[5437.28 → 5437.46] yeah,
[5437.46 → 5438.20] this was sick.
[5439.14 → 5441.70] I actually didn't even know.
[5442.08 → 5442.90] That's kind of funny.
[5444.38 → 5446.06] I didn't know this was going to be in the doc.
[5446.16 → 5447.16] I watched like a
[5447.26 → 5447.94] a short,
[5448.28 → 5449.08] I think on it.
[5449.80 → 5450.56] And then was like,
[5450.60 → 5450.76] man,
[5450.78 → 5452.04] I wish I could see the whole thing.
[5452.36 → 5453.98] So now I need to watch the whole video.
[5457.24 → 5457.60] Okay.
[5457.72 → 5458.24] I see.
[5458.36 → 5458.64] So yeah,
[5458.64 → 5458.84] the
[5458.84 → 5460.72] the keyboard is like embedded in the table,
[5460.72 → 5462.24] but there isn't a mouse,
[5462.58 → 5464.06] which is interesting.
[5464.06 → 5464.32] Yeah.
[5464.32 → 5465.62] There are products like that.
[5465.72 → 5468.12] He could have used the same technology for the keyboard,
[5468.28 → 5473.18] but I actually am happy that he didn't because there are limitations to it.
[5474.22 → 5474.70] Right.
[5477.38 → 5478.32] Adjustable sense.
[5478.46 → 5479.28] Oh my goodness.
[5480.14 → 5480.98] This is amazing.
[5481.02 → 5482.74] That looks so insane.
[5484.42 → 5484.86] Absolutely.
[5485.24 → 5485.52] Next.
[5485.62 → 5487.18] That looks like something from like a
[5487.18 → 5491.06] a movie on like future tech and AI from like the early two thousands.
[5491.74 → 5491.98] Yeah.
[5492.12 → 5493.50] You know where they fake it.
[5493.50 → 5495.08] But he actually did it.
[5495.18 → 5495.38] Yeah.
[5495.38 → 5497.36] You guys are going to have to watch crazy.
[5497.68 → 5499.08] You should absolutely check it out.
[5499.60 → 5500.62] That's super cool.
[5501.28 → 5502.98] All the stuff that's embedded in here.
[5503.06 → 5504.80] The zero gram invisible mouse.
[5504.88 → 5506.00] I love the gaming memes.
[5507.14 → 5507.54] Fantastic.
[5508.82 → 5509.18] Wow.
[5509.88 → 5510.24] Okay.
[5510.24 → 5511.52] I'm going to have to.
[5511.52 → 5512.08] Super cool.
[5512.38 → 5512.60] Can we,
[5512.82 → 5513.18] can we,
[5513.50 → 5515.84] can people post the link to that in chat or something?
[5515.96 → 5516.26] Of course.
[5516.74 → 5516.90] Oh,
[5516.92 → 5517.10] I mean,
[5517.12 → 5517.80] I can just do it.
[5518.02 → 5518.16] Cool.
[5518.48 → 5518.66] Yeah.
[5518.70 → 5518.92] Yeah.
[5519.36 → 5520.30] People are asking for the link.
[5520.40 → 5520.58] Yeah.
[5520.58 → 5520.74] Yeah.
[5520.74 → 5521.14] Don't worry.
[5521.24 → 5521.52] Don't worry.
[5521.56 → 5522.18] I got you guys.
[5522.24 → 5522.96] I got you guys.
[5523.36 → 5524.12] Basically homeless.
[5524.26 → 5525.12] Go check out the
[5525.12 → 5526.50] the super tiny one as well.
[5526.98 → 5528.58] I got to watch more of his stuff.
[5528.88 → 5529.88] Cause that was really,
[5530.10 → 5531.08] that was one of those channels,
[5531.08 → 5534.54] like DIY perks where like it doesn't publish that much.
[5535.14 → 5535.52] Um,
[5535.70 → 5536.46] so it's easy.
[5536.66 → 5538.62] I freaking love DIY perks.
[5538.62 → 5540.06] Or like glasses and stuff.
[5540.16 → 5540.42] Oh yeah.
[5540.52 → 5540.68] Yeah.
[5540.86 → 5541.12] Yeah.
[5541.12 → 5541.18] Yeah.
[5541.18 → 5541.80] We're just like,
[5541.86 → 5542.30] they're not,
[5542.48 → 5544.64] they're not prolific publishers like we are.
[5544.64 → 5545.70] But every time they drop,
[5545.78 → 5546.42] it's a banger.
[5546.42 → 5547.16] It's a banger.
[5547.66 → 5548.88] It's a banger.
[5550.92 → 5551.66] YouTube chat.
[5551.74 → 5553.02] I bet it's a poor experience.
[5554.52 → 5556.34] That is not the point.
[5559.12 → 5561.04] This is why I never look at YouTube chat.
[5561.08 → 5564.36] Oh man.
[5564.36 → 5565.36] Actual unwashed masses.
[5565.70 → 5565.88] JK.
[5566.02 → 5566.28] Love you.
[5566.32 → 5566.82] YouTube chat.
[5567.24 → 5567.48] Yeah.
[5567.92 → 5569.56] At least you're not as bad as Twitch chat.
[5569.64 → 5569.98] There you go.
[5570.06 → 5570.28] Boom.
[5570.38 → 5570.58] Roasted.
[5570.80 → 5571.38] Got them.
[5571.82 → 5572.26] Okay.
[5573.72 → 5574.56] Rip Cortana.
[5574.64 → 5576.54] Do we only have one after dark?
[5576.54 → 5578.28] We have five minutes.
[5578.52 → 5579.20] Okay.
[5579.46 → 5585.52] The national eating disorders association replaced their helpline with a chatbot.
[5586.00 → 5590.54] They've replaced all hotline workers and volunteers with a chatbot.
[5591.08 → 5594.74] Four days after the workers voted to unionize.
[5594.74 → 5602.02] If you thought AI is not coming for my job, and you worked for the national eating disorders
[5602.02 → 5602.76] association.
[5603.22 → 5604.50] You'd no longer think that.
[5604.56 → 5606.96] You were objectively incorrect.
[5607.34 → 5610.22] This is absolutely mind-blowing.
[5610.36 → 5612.02] And this is the
[5612.02 → 5612.52] the
[5612.52 → 5612.58] the
[5612.58 → 5614.02] the leading edge.
[5614.58 → 5617.94] This is the tip of the wave that's coming.
[5618.30 → 5621.22] The hotline workers included a handful of paid staff,
[5621.28 → 5622.98] as well as around 200 volunteers.
[5623.30 → 5626.42] The employees demands did not include pay raises.
[5626.42 → 5632.18] They asked for higher staffing levels and ongoing training to deal with staff burnout and ballooning
[5632.18 → 5632.86] wait times.
[5634.06 → 5634.54] Um,
[5634.86 → 5639.24] NDA has used the chatbot called Tessa since February 2022.
[5639.62 → 5645.02] It is not based on ChatGPT and does not make decisions or grow.
[5645.12 → 5649.96] It follows predetermined pathways based on the knowledge of the researchers who made it.
[5649.96 → 5651.38] So this is an old school chap.
[5651.46 → 5653.68] I went into this assuming it was an AI chatbot.
[5653.92 → 5655.20] This is an old school chatbot.
[5655.28 → 5657.96] Like the thing that helped you with your Lego thing.
[5658.72 → 5660.30] Probably better because like,
[5660.42 → 5660.56] okay.
[5660.68 → 5661.78] So it won't hallucinate.
[5661.94 → 5662.24] Yes.
[5662.38 → 5666.38] The reason why I freaked out about this was remembered when we had that conversation forever
[5666.38 → 5669.52] ago about the AI that convinced the dude to kill himself.
[5669.58 → 5670.62] So join them or whatever.
[5670.62 → 5672.86] I was worried that type of stuff would happen.
[5673.84 → 5674.24] Um,
[5674.46 → 5674.96] but it,
[5674.96 → 5677.62] it like won't happen with this type of system.
[5677.90 → 5677.98] Yeah.
[5678.06 → 5681.16] But while many users have rated the bot as helpful,
[5681.40 → 5686.42] its creator has stated that it is not an adequate replacement for a human staffed help.
[5686.42 → 5686.62] Yeah.
[5686.66 → 5687.76] So that all sounds right.
[5689.16 → 5689.62] Oh man.
[5690.42 → 5697.14] Helpline volunteers were asked to act as testers for the chatbot instead of providing one on
[5697.14 → 5698.50] one support to callers.
[5698.50 → 5702.26] 70,000 people last year.
[5702.48 → 5702.78] Wow.
[5703.22 → 5703.56] So wait,
[5703.64 → 5703.80] what,
[5703.90 → 5705.04] what actually happened?
[5705.22 → 5706.44] Cause it said they did this.
[5706.60 → 5708.38] They've been doing this since February,
[5708.56 → 5708.98] 2022.
[5708.98 → 5712.76] So did they do this back in February 2022 or what,
[5712.80 → 5713.56] what changed?
[5716.24 → 5716.68] No,
[5716.70 → 5716.80] no,
[5716.80 → 5717.62] they've just had it.
[5717.68 → 5719.72] Now it's just all that's available.
[5719.88 → 5721.10] So they just dropped everybody.
[5721.18 → 5721.32] Yeah.
[5721.36 → 5721.76] See you later.
[5722.24 → 5722.50] Wow.
[5723.14 → 5723.54] Um,
[5723.84 → 5724.06] this,
[5724.24 → 5725.64] this is kind of wild.
[5725.64 → 5729.18] The Google Play Store has suspended the app downloader,
[5729.50 → 5732.62] a prop popular app for side loading on Android TV,
[5733.08 → 5739.42] following a DMCA takedown from several Israeli TV companies who complained that the app is
[5739.42 → 5742.50] capable of loading piracy websites.
[5742.50 → 5743.50] Yeah.
[5743.50 → 5744.18] Yeah.
[5744.26 → 5748.18] That face is about how you should be feeling about this right now.
[5749.08 → 5757.46] Downloader is essentially a combination of a web browser and file manager that allows Android TV owners to easily download files from the internet onto their device.
[5757.46 → 5759.96] It can display piracy websites.
[5759.96 → 5760.40] Yes.
[5760.84 → 5766.96] But only to the same degree that any other web browser can display piracy websites.
[5767.20 → 5769.28] So they need to remove Chrome from the play store.
[5770.38 → 5770.66] Yeah.
[5771.32 → 5774.42] The specific piracy site that was noted in the complaint,
[5774.72 → 5775.20] Diderot,
[5775.32 → 5775.90] Diderot?
[5775.98 → 5776.48] I don't know.
[5776.80 → 5779.48] Has received injunctions from Israeli and U S federal courts.
[5779.90 → 5780.20] However,
[5780.30 → 5784.84] it is still online and can still be accessed in Google Chrome.
[5785.06 → 5785.32] Yeah.
[5785.32 → 5786.32] Uh,
[5786.96 → 5790.62] prior to the takedown downloader had been downloaded over 5 million times.
[5790.74 → 5791.10] Yo dog,
[5791.16 → 5792.02] I heard you like downloading.
[5792.12 → 5793.28] So I put a downloader in your download.
[5793.38 → 5793.94] It doesn't matter.
[5794.36 → 5794.78] Um,
[5794.90 → 5798.64] Google has rejected the developers appeal to reverse the decision.
[5798.88 → 5804.32] It's still available on the Amazon app store and the developers own website where you can sideload it,
[5804.40 → 5804.60] I guess.
[5804.66 → 5806.78] But if it's for sideloading,
[5806.90 → 5807.04] can,
[5807.16 → 5808.64] can be just,
[5808.78 → 5813.78] can we just stop letting tech illiterate people make legal decisions about tech?
[5813.78 → 5815.14] Is that something we can do?
[5815.32 → 5816.74] Do we have that power?
[5820.20 → 5820.84] Then again,
[5820.84 → 5824.00] you let big tech be in charge of it, and they're just going to walk all over everybody.
[5824.06 → 5824.32] Anyway,
[5824.38 → 5825.18] it's not going to be better.
[5825.34 → 5825.60] Yep.
[5825.86 → 5826.22] Oh,
[5826.22 → 5827.26] yep.
[5829.58 → 5830.20] Oh man,
[5830.22 → 5831.04] that's really stupid.
[5832.74 → 5835.16] Like how many points did your IQ drop?
[5835.48 → 5836.36] Just hearing this,
[5836.36 → 5838.40] what was remaining?
[5838.60 → 5838.98] I'll say.
[5839.66 → 5840.14] Um,
[5841.20 → 5841.94] let's move on.
[5842.04 → 5843.04] We don't have that much time.
[5843.08 → 5843.26] Yeah,
[5843.30 → 5843.68] fine.
[5843.74 → 5845.04] Do we have any time for more topics?
[5845.04 → 5845.36] Okay.
[5845.36 → 5847.18] The YouTuber was arrested for posting,
[5847.36 → 5848.06] monetizing,
[5848.52 → 5850.80] and posting and monetizing copyrighted content.
[5851.36 → 5857.18] The 52-year-old YouTuber was accused of uploading and monetizing a play through of the visual novel,
[5857.34 → 5858.14] Stein's Gate,
[5858.34 → 5859.54] My Darling's Embrace,
[5859.94 → 5861.86] a romantic comedy dating sim,
[5861.86 → 5863.62] without permission from the developer.
[5864.16 → 5867.84] They had likewise posted videos that contained footage from anime series.
[5868.32 → 5869.48] These were not full episodes.
[5869.68 → 5872.10] They were narrated summaries condensing the material,
[5872.24 → 5874.36] which is a popular video genre in Japan.
[5875.36 → 5879.16] A primary point of contention was the relatively long duration of the videos
[5879.16 → 5881.54] and the fact that they contained the game's ending,
[5881.72 → 5884.10] meaning that they might act as a replacement for the original material.
[5884.24 → 5884.60] Seriously?
[5885.44 → 5886.00] Arrested.
[5886.00 → 5889.16] Bad precedent.
[5889.82 → 5890.18] Yeah.
[5891.24 → 5899.00] And this kind of seems to explain why Nintendo doesn't understand how the entire rest of the world
[5899.00 → 5901.00] views fair use,
[5901.12 → 5902.74] because my understanding is fair use,
[5902.82 → 5904.14] like kind of doesn't really exist there.
[5904.22 → 5904.54] Is that,
[5905.26 → 5907.38] like at least not in the same way that it does here?
[5907.40 → 5908.16] I have no idea,
[5908.28 → 5909.18] but I don't think so.
[5909.18 → 5915.76] I have also heard some pretty intense arguments against people streaming or making Lets Plays or whatever
[5915.76 → 5917.38] of visual novels specifically.
[5917.60 → 5918.46] Is that what this was?
[5918.60 → 5918.82] Yeah.
[5918.88 → 5919.34] I was reading some,
[5919.40 → 5919.58] yeah,
[5919.90 → 5921.02] because it is...
[5921.02 → 5922.52] Romantic comedy dating sim,
[5922.64 → 5923.40] but yeah.
[5923.74 → 5924.00] Oh.
[5925.76 → 5926.52] I thought it was...
[5926.52 → 5927.98] Seems to be very story driven.
[5929.04 → 5929.44] Yeah,
[5929.48 → 5929.66] okay,
[5929.70 → 5931.00] so I'm going to go on a tangent,
[5931.14 → 5931.46] I guess,
[5931.48 → 5933.62] and just say for visual novels specifically,
[5933.74 → 5935.56] because this is a thing on like Steam and stuff,
[5935.88 → 5937.20] people have been pretty against it,
[5937.20 → 5939.86] because you're basically live-streaming,
[5940.44 → 5941.74] flipping the pages in a book,
[5942.24 → 5944.16] and you're showing all the pages in the book.
[5944.68 → 5945.12] Right.
[5945.60 → 5948.94] Like there actually is not any other content.
[5949.24 → 5951.06] You're not playing the game,
[5951.28 → 5951.52] right?
[5952.14 → 5952.52] So,
[5952.62 → 5952.88] I don't know.
[5952.94 → 5954.10] This one sounds like it's not that,
[5954.18 → 5954.82] but that's just like,
[5954.88 → 5957.12] I know that's an argument that's going on.
[5957.20 → 5957.34] Yeah,
[5957.38 → 5958.16] Jake from The Lab,
[5958.22 → 5959.94] who I think lived over there for a few years,
[5960.18 → 5960.68] says,
[5960.78 → 5961.82] this is an interesting one,
[5961.90 → 5967.66] as Japanese copyright law dictates that the owners need to aggressively defend their copyright,
[5967.82 → 5969.72] kind of like how trademark laws work here.
[5969.72 → 5970.36] So,
[5970.36 → 5975.58] this may not actually be something that the developer necessarily wants to do,
[5975.68 → 5976.82] but if they want to keep their copyright,
[5977.40 → 5977.98] that's it.
[5979.98 → 5980.58] Oh,
[5980.72 → 5981.30] seriously?
[5981.68 → 5984.52] Activision shuts down community run servers for Legacy COD.
[5985.16 → 5986.12] See you later.
[5986.94 → 5988.76] Cease and desist from Activision.
[5988.76 → 5988.92] So,
[5988.92 → 5993.08] the problem is that those community servers were the only safe way to play those games,
[5993.14 → 5996.38] because Activision is not keeping their own servers up to date.
[5996.58 → 5996.98] So,
[5997.34 → 5997.86] you can,
[5998.44 → 5998.96] something,
[5999.10 → 5999.46] something,
[5999.82 → 6002.44] attack people through Activision servers,
[6002.50 → 6003.12] because they're not secure.
[6003.84 → 6004.92] I don't know all the details,
[6005.04 → 6005.62] but I know it's like,
[6005.72 → 6005.94] bad.
[6006.08 → 6007.94] And they implemented their own anti-cheat,
[6008.00 → 6008.70] which is super cool.
[6008.76 → 6010.56] This is for the original Modern Warfare 2.
[6010.80 → 6010.98] Yeah,
[6010.98 → 6011.16] it's like,
[6011.20 → 6011.64] way better.
[6012.70 → 6013.02] Ah,
[6013.12 → 6019.56] a possible cause for their legal action is the fact that one of X-Lab's setup guides contained a link to an illegal copy of the game.
[6019.80 → 6019.98] Well,
[6020.02 → 6020.72] that's bad.
[6020.82 → 6021.96] But then they should have just said,
[6022.06 → 6022.90] take that down.
[6023.12 → 6023.36] Yeah.
[6023.74 → 6026.02] But then I can see why they don't want to micromanage this.
[6026.34 → 6026.58] Yep.
[6026.88 → 6027.10] Yeah,
[6027.10 → 6027.90] I shouldn't have done that.
[6028.24 → 6028.40] So,
[6028.64 → 6031.82] the Modern Warfare 2 Steam page has seen a wave of negative reviews,
[6031.82 → 6034.16] claiming that the game can no longer be safely played.
[6034.30 → 6034.88] That's true.
[6035.38 → 6036.18] Discussion question.
[6036.30 → 6042.64] Is there a way for companies to defend their IP while allowing the community to take over old games if they're no longer interested in maintaining them?
[6042.74 → 6043.00] Yes,
[6043.08 → 6043.78] there is.
[6044.38 → 6045.00] Sort of.
[6045.36 → 6046.54] Because with Supreme Commander,
[6046.72 → 6047.54] which is super cool,
[6047.64 → 6049.58] the way that FA Forever exists,
[6050.08 → 6052.92] that was an IP that was no longer actively being developed,
[6053.04 → 6055.22] whereas Call of Duty is.
[6057.90 → 6058.30] So,
[6058.40 → 6060.00] it's all fine and good as long as this,
[6060.42 → 6060.66] you know,
[6060.66 → 6063.90] X-Labs version of the server is good,
[6064.02 → 6066.14] and nobody is getting infected or whatever,
[6066.68 → 6068.94] but as soon as they make a mistake,
[6069.44 → 6069.60] well,
[6069.62 → 6070.72] whose liability is that?
[6071.06 → 6071.22] Yeah.
[6071.54 → 6072.48] But then you shouldn't,
[6072.84 → 6073.62] it should be,
[6074.50 → 6075.10] ugh,
[6075.58 → 6076.36] it's a tough,
[6076.52 → 6077.32] messy topic.
[6077.48 → 6077.84] It's hairy.
[6078.04 → 6078.72] But they should not,
[6078.88 → 6079.16] ugh.
[6080.60 → 6082.72] There should be some form of recourse
[6082.72 → 6085.48] for them selling old games
[6085.48 → 6087.38] at full fat price
[6087.38 → 6090.42] that are unplayable safely.
[6090.86 → 6091.30] Well,
[6091.38 → 6091.58] yeah.
[6091.94 → 6094.54] For massively extended periods of time.
[6094.94 → 6096.48] I think you get like three bucks
[6096.48 → 6097.42] and your class action,
[6097.42 → 6097.82] uh,
[6097.82 → 6098.10] payout.
[6098.32 → 6098.58] Yeah.
[6100.54 → 6101.02] Yep.
[6101.12 → 6101.34] Yep.
[6101.42 → 6102.36] Just never matters.
[6102.36 → 6105.18] And YouTube killed stories.
[6105.84 → 6108.08] I am never getting a stories function
[6108.08 → 6109.68] on my foldable device
[6109.68 → 6113.10] because YouTube turned off the feature
[6113.10 → 6114.34] or is turning it off.
[6114.42 → 6115.70] June 26th.
[6115.84 → 6117.70] That is the last date
[6117.70 → 6119.10] and apparently it's because
[6119.10 → 6120.32] almost no one uses them.
[6120.32 → 6120.80] I mean,
[6120.84 → 6121.70] they got a lot of views,
[6121.90 → 6122.36] um,
[6122.52 → 6123.10] back when,
[6123.22 → 6123.40] you know,
[6123.42 → 6124.00] they were a thing,
[6124.12 → 6126.96] but they want people to use community posts,
[6127.02 → 6128.30] which appear to be gaining traction
[6128.30 → 6129.90] and upload shorts.
[6130.34 → 6131.34] So there you have it.
[6131.62 → 6132.64] I'm never getting stories
[6132.64 → 6134.10] and I guess that's okay
[6134.10 → 6135.70] because it didn't really matter
[6135.70 → 6137.36] except that there were some really cool things
[6137.36 → 6138.26] you could do with stories.
[6138.54 → 6140.82] Like replying to comments with a story.
[6140.92 → 6141.96] Sometimes it's not convenient
[6141.96 → 6143.36] to type out a thing on my phone
[6143.36 → 6144.08] and I'd like to just,
[6144.38 → 6145.28] I had pitched to them,
[6145.36 → 6145.50] hey,
[6145.60 → 6146.88] how about expanding stories
[6146.88 → 6148.96] so that it's a feature that exists
[6148.96 → 6150.12] more like in the comments,
[6150.12 → 6150.90] under a video.
[6151.76 → 6152.16] So,
[6152.36 → 6152.90] uh,
[6152.92 → 6153.16] you know,
[6153.22 → 6154.82] a comment that got a lot of upvotes,
[6154.92 → 6156.80] I'd be able to just click a button
[6156.80 → 6157.80] in my creator app
[6157.80 → 6159.22] and record a quick response to it
[6159.22 → 6160.12] and it could just live there.
[6160.14 → 6162.40] Like there are absolutely cool ways
[6162.40 → 6163.42] that you could use stories
[6163.42 → 6165.40] and I think that YouTube is throwing the baby out
[6165.40 → 6167.00] with the bathwater here a little bit,
[6167.08 → 6167.40] but hey,
[6167.84 → 6169.12] that's the Google way.
[6171.06 → 6175.18] Let's create two different kinds of short video
[6175.18 → 6176.88] and they'll,
[6176.98 → 6178.74] they'll compete against each other,
[6178.74 → 6180.90] but one of them is monetizable
[6180.90 → 6184.44] so that one's not definitely the one that's going to win.
[6184.70 → 6185.00] Yeah!
[6185.48 → 6185.96] Go,
[6186.34 → 6187.04] team!
[6187.04 → 6188.20] team!
[6189.56 → 6191.74] The number of times that they assured me
[6191.74 → 6194.26] that they were probably going to be merged
[6194.26 → 6196.02] and that stories wasn't going away
[6196.02 → 6197.44] and that they were definitely bringing,
[6197.66 → 6199.82] the number of YouTube employees
[6199.82 → 6200.68] who have told me,
[6201.00 → 6201.34] soon,
[6201.74 → 6203.24] for that feature on my phone
[6203.24 → 6205.14] is at least three.
[6205.14 → 6205.20] three.
[6207.30 → 6208.32] Not going to name them,
[6208.34 → 6208.88] it doesn't matter,
[6208.96 → 6209.30] it's over,
[6209.74 → 6211.28] but it's at least three
[6211.28 → 6212.62] and you know who you are.
[6214.30 → 6215.84] The last thing I want to talk about
[6215.84 → 6218.32] is our 45,000 watt fan.
[6219.44 → 6219.84] Okay.
[6219.98 → 6220.94] Think about that number.
[6220.94 → 6221.28] Yeah,
[6221.38 → 6221.74] I know.
[6222.12 → 6225.18] 45,000 watts.
[6225.46 → 6225.74] Yeah,
[6225.86 → 6226.82] I've seen it.
[6227.24 → 6228.66] Did you see it in operation?
[6228.88 → 6229.02] No.
[6229.84 → 6231.26] How long was it in operation?
[6231.80 → 6232.36] Scary.
[6234.38 → 6238.00] Probably a total of about 10, 15 minutes.
[6238.32 → 6238.84] Oh, wow.
[6239.18 → 6241.86] Because that's as long as we can power it for.
[6241.96 → 6242.16] Yeah.
[6242.60 → 6245.58] It actually draws so much power
[6245.58 → 6247.94] that we could not safely power it
[6247.94 → 6250.96] with the entire output of the transformer
[6250.96 → 6252.36] in that unit.
[6256.20 → 6257.72] That's so insane.
[6258.28 → 6259.94] I'm just like...
[6259.94 → 6261.36] What the heck?
[6261.36 → 6263.38] It generates so much thrust
[6263.38 → 6265.48] that it could almost hover
[6265.48 → 6266.70] with me sitting on it.
[6270.58 → 6270.98] Wow.
[6271.30 → 6274.10] It's going to be a fun video.
[6274.30 → 6275.60] Do you know what they're used for?
[6276.76 → 6277.50] I don't know.
[6277.84 → 6278.02] Oh,
[6278.08 → 6279.28] we probably should have talked about that.
[6280.60 → 6281.00] Whoops.
[6282.00 → 6282.38] Well,
[6282.50 → 6283.10] maybe...
[6283.10 → 6283.30] Okay,
[6283.32 → 6284.14] they have a bigger one.
[6284.64 → 6285.58] So maybe we'll talk about
[6285.58 → 6286.70] what they're for in the sequel.
[6287.78 → 6288.18] Okay.
[6288.28 → 6289.64] But we cool a computer with it.
[6290.60 → 6290.96] Obviously.
[6291.84 → 6292.20] Yeah.
[6292.82 → 6294.12] I am genuinely interested
[6294.12 → 6295.14] to see what happens
[6295.14 → 6295.80] to the components
[6295.80 → 6296.82] or what you guys did
[6296.82 → 6297.70] to make it so that things
[6297.70 → 6298.56] wouldn't happen to them.
[6298.68 → 6298.84] Yeah,
[6298.94 → 6299.20] Alex.
[6299.22 → 6299.80] Either one of those.
[6299.82 → 6301.14] Alex and Kyle were involved.
[6301.30 → 6302.00] So you know it's going to be...
[6302.00 → 6302.72] Oh, I'm sure it's awesome.
[6302.98 → 6303.80] ...completely stupid.
[6303.90 → 6304.36] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6304.44 → 6304.96] I'm excited.
[6305.26 → 6305.46] Okay.
[6305.66 → 6306.04] All right.
[6306.18 → 6307.52] Time for WAN show after dark.
[6309.52 → 6310.98] Which is not that dark anymore.
[6311.84 → 6313.06] Because we had some feedback.
[6313.28 → 6314.30] We listen sometimes.
[6314.30 → 6315.30] WAN after...
[6315.30 → 6317.00] slightly darker.
[6318.14 → 6318.54] Yeah.
[6318.96 → 6320.10] It's like barely even noticeable.
[6320.28 → 6320.48] Yeah.
[6320.76 → 6321.58] Yeah, that's all right.
[6321.68 → 6321.80] That's pretty good.
[6321.88 → 6322.52] Yeah, that's okay.
[6322.60 → 6323.36] Good job, Dan.
[6323.40 → 6323.98] You can tell.
[6324.80 → 6325.90] Now, that was really dark
[6325.90 → 6327.06] when he walked right in front
[6327.06 → 6327.46] of the camera.
[6327.68 → 6328.78] Yeah, how would you do that?
[6328.78 → 6330.22] Remember when Dan used to
[6330.22 → 6331.14] crawl under the camera
[6331.14 → 6332.44] and stuff and give...
[6332.44 → 6333.60] I used to have...
[6333.60 → 6334.48] I used to have
[6334.48 → 6335.78] production standards
[6335.78 → 6337.20] and they just...
[6337.20 → 6338.36] We broke him.
[6338.62 → 6339.34] Throw him away.
[6339.48 → 6339.82] I don't know how
[6339.82 → 6340.94] to comb my hair anymore.
[6341.06 → 6341.34] Okay.
[6341.94 → 6343.38] Merch messages, I guess.
[6343.50 → 6344.06] All right, cool.
[6345.58 → 6346.04] Sure.
[6346.50 → 6347.52] Greetings from Quebec.
[6347.96 → 6348.66] Since the warranty
[6348.66 → 6350.46] of my Z Fold 3
[6350.46 → 6351.32] is now over,
[6351.48 → 6352.60] I'm afraid to break it.
[6352.60 → 6353.72] What would you suggest
[6353.72 → 6354.54] as a user
[6354.54 → 6355.60] to keep it as long
[6355.60 → 6356.16] as possible?
[6356.62 → 6356.92] P.S.
[6356.92 → 6358.92] when ABC of gaming
[6358.92 → 6359.76] in French?
[6363.32 → 6363.92] Okay.
[6364.46 → 6364.98] So,
[6365.60 → 6366.40] what would you suggest
[6366.40 → 6367.14] to keep as long
[6367.14 → 6367.70] as possible?
[6368.18 → 6368.58] I mean,
[6368.96 → 6370.86] be careful with it.
[6372.10 → 6374.00] As for ABCs of gaming
[6374.00 → 6374.74] in French,
[6375.46 → 6376.38] my French,
[6376.82 → 6378.10] not good enough.
[6380.02 → 6380.44] I mean,
[6380.44 → 6381.20] maybe we could
[6381.20 → 6382.30] try and hire
[6382.30 → 6382.74] a translator.
[6383.02 → 6384.06] That would be a...
[6384.06 → 6384.92] That would be
[6384.92 → 6385.90] a very difficult
[6385.90 → 6386.66] thing
[6386.66 → 6387.76] to translate
[6387.76 → 6388.86] and maintain
[6388.86 → 6389.60] the meter.
[6389.76 → 6389.96] Oh, yeah,
[6390.02 → 6390.70] because it is like...
[6390.70 → 6391.14] It rhymes.
[6391.14 → 6391.98] Rhymes and stuff.
[6392.10 → 6392.40] Yeah.
[6392.74 → 6392.94] Yeah,
[6392.94 → 6393.32] that's actually
[6393.32 → 6393.78] pretty rough.
[6394.48 → 6394.96] And like,
[6395.12 → 6398.06] there are songs
[6398.06 → 6398.60] that have been
[6398.60 → 6400.00] successfully translated
[6400.00 → 6400.74] from English
[6400.74 → 6401.20] to French
[6401.20 → 6402.04] and vice versa.
[6402.76 → 6403.98] I think that book
[6403.98 → 6405.16] would be really challenging
[6405.16 → 6406.00] having written
[6406.00 → 6406.98] the English one.
[6407.70 → 6408.10] It's almost
[6408.10 → 6409.14] a whole other book.
[6409.40 → 6409.64] Well,
[6409.66 → 6410.76] it also just contains
[6410.76 → 6411.88] like technical terminology
[6411.88 → 6412.98] for which the literal
[6412.98 → 6413.74] direct translation
[6413.74 → 6414.84] is just that word.
[6414.84 → 6416.42] but like,
[6416.72 → 6417.14] en Français,
[6418.22 → 6419.56] like with a French accent.
[6419.96 → 6420.32] So I,
[6420.68 → 6420.96] sorry.
[6422.62 → 6423.06] AJ,
[6423.26 → 6423.70] one of our
[6423.70 → 6424.92] legitimately actually
[6424.92 → 6426.26] like francophone
[6426.26 → 6428.42] team members,
[6428.88 → 6429.12] the?
[6430.02 → 6430.42] Legitimately,
[6430.54 → 6431.40] do we have anyone else?
[6431.76 → 6431.96] Oh,
[6432.06 → 6434.84] there's other...
[6435.52 → 6436.30] A Prime,
[6436.62 → 6437.00] Demo.
[6437.00 → 6437.22] Alex.
[6438.22 → 6438.86] I think that's it.
[6439.20 → 6439.32] Yeah.
[6439.32 → 6439.90] I think it's A Prime
[6439.90 → 6440.30] in Demo.
[6440.70 → 6440.88] Yeah,
[6440.94 → 6441.20] okay.
[6441.40 → 6441.68] All right,
[6441.72 → 6442.06] never mind.
[6442.62 → 6443.02] Um,
[6443.62 → 6443.98] anyway,
[6445.12 → 6445.58] no.
[6446.96 → 6447.40] Sorry.
[6448.28 → 6448.64] Antoine?
[6450.50 → 6450.94] Oh,
[6451.00 → 6451.16] yeah,
[6451.24 → 6451.40] yeah,
[6451.46 → 6452.50] he must speak French.
[6452.52 → 6453.18] So four,
[6453.26 → 6453.54] I think?
[6455.58 → 6456.08] I don't know.
[6456.16 → 6456.32] Oh,
[6456.52 → 6458.08] David speaks French.
[6458.44 → 6458.54] Ah.
[6458.78 → 6459.70] Monsieur Gaultier.
[6460.00 → 6460.20] Ah.
[6460.68 → 6460.94] Yeah.
[6461.20 → 6461.40] Yeah,
[6461.40 → 6462.38] so you'd think I would,
[6462.48 → 6462.76] but no.
[6462.86 → 6463.38] Cafetière.
[6465.22 → 6466.16] Not even a little.
[6466.38 → 6467.16] He doesn't even know
[6467.16 → 6467.80] what I just said.
[6469.82 → 6470.24] No,
[6470.30 → 6470.68] I do.
[6470.82 → 6471.22] I do.
[6471.90 → 6472.68] I speak French
[6472.68 → 6473.48] and then my last name.
[6475.08 → 6475.48] Okay.
[6475.80 → 6476.80] I know that much.
[6477.42 → 6478.54] That's actually like
[6478.54 → 6479.54] brushing on the limit.
[6483.22 → 6484.74] I know Soda Mousse.
[6485.92 → 6486.32] Okay.
[6487.50 → 6488.62] Because it's on packages.
[6489.40 → 6489.80] Okay.
[6489.94 → 6490.42] That's why.
[6490.92 → 6491.90] There's no other reason.
[6492.20 → 6492.38] Wait,
[6492.54 → 6493.40] like Cream Soda?
[6493.42 → 6493.84] Cream Soda.
[6494.44 → 6495.50] I thought it was funny
[6495.50 → 6496.10] when I was a kid.
[6496.10 → 6497.16] How often do you even
[6497.16 → 6498.50] f***ING drink Cream Soda?
[6498.50 → 6499.14] I do not remember
[6499.14 → 6499.76] the last time.
[6500.04 → 6500.70] But when I was a kid,
[6500.74 → 6501.42] I thought it was funny.
[6501.52 → 6502.18] So I remembered it.
[6502.90 → 6503.24] Okay.
[6503.60 → 6503.80] Yeah.
[6504.18 → 6505.20] That's what you retain.
[6505.36 → 6505.56] Yeah.
[6506.34 → 6506.70] Okay.
[6509.64 → 6510.30] We need to,
[6510.34 → 6511.20] we need to burn through
[6511.20 → 6511.66] some of these.
[6511.74 → 6512.68] We have like no time.
[6513.40 → 6513.66] Yeah,
[6513.80 → 6514.06] Luke.
[6514.78 → 6515.46] Cream Soda.
[6516.18 → 6516.54] Hello.
[6517.08 → 6517.48] Hello,
[6517.58 → 6518.18] Linus and Luke.
[6518.18 → 6519.30] Greetings from Germany.
[6519.66 → 6520.80] I always wondered
[6520.80 → 6521.92] if you guys got in trouble
[6521.92 → 6523.70] or if sponsors frowned upon
[6523.70 → 6524.98] you guys using memes
[6524.98 → 6526.40] in your sponsored videos.
[6526.54 → 6527.84] It means like 69
[6527.84 → 6529.72] or 420.
[6530.16 → 6531.24] Every once in a while
[6531.24 → 6532.78] we had a video
[6532.78 → 6533.78] that was sponsored
[6533.78 → 6536.26] by someone.
[6536.74 → 6537.38] I don't remember.
[6537.50 → 6537.82] Was it,
[6537.82 → 6538.44] was it HP?
[6538.66 → 6538.94] I don't know.
[6538.98 → 6539.26] Anyway,
[6539.46 → 6541.36] the product was
[6541.36 → 6543.12] their Z workstation 420
[6543.12 → 6545.34] and we managed to slip
[6545.34 → 6547.12] a lot of pot jokes
[6547.12 → 6547.72] into it,
[6547.78 → 6548.96] but there was one
[6548.96 → 6550.28] particular shot
[6550.28 → 6551.94] where we actually put
[6551.94 → 6553.08] like a
[6553.08 → 6555.08] a thing in the front grill
[6555.08 → 6555.52] of it
[6555.52 → 6557.04] and had it smoking.
[6557.32 → 6558.62] Like they had the computer
[6558.62 → 6559.58] smoking weed
[6559.58 → 6561.88] and that did not make it
[6561.88 → 6562.80] past the sensors.
[6562.92 → 6563.04] Wow.
[6563.44 → 6563.76] Oh yeah.
[6563.76 → 6564.66] I remember that.
[6565.42 → 6568.66] In general though,
[6568.82 → 6570.04] I think sponsors
[6570.04 → 6571.38] know what this is.
[6571.76 → 6572.68] Like if you don't
[6572.68 → 6573.72] do your due diligence
[6573.72 → 6575.08] watching a couple videos
[6575.08 → 6575.72] from a channel
[6575.72 → 6576.56] before you throw money
[6576.56 → 6576.98] at them,
[6577.12 → 6577.98] that's on you.
[6578.56 → 6579.90] I don't feel bad.
[6582.60 → 6583.98] Any new house videos
[6583.98 → 6584.56] coming soon?
[6584.66 → 6585.58] I think it's the most
[6585.58 → 6586.40] engaging content
[6586.40 → 6587.16] on the channel.
[6587.46 → 6588.14] I don't know.
[6588.22 → 6589.10] Maybe if my pool
[6589.10 → 6590.12] ever gets finished.
[6590.20 → 6590.92] Speaking of which,
[6590.94 → 6591.52] there's been a new
[6591.52 → 6592.24] development there.
[6592.78 → 6594.26] We've issued an ultimatum.
[6594.66 → 6595.10] They,
[6595.18 → 6595.42] they,
[6595.54 → 6596.06] they've been,
[6596.48 → 6597.20] they told us it was
[6597.20 → 6597.94] going to be two weeks
[6597.94 → 6598.90] to completion
[6598.90 → 6599.64] three weeks ago.
[6599.72 → 6600.58] We've had to reschedule
[6600.58 → 6601.30] our electrician
[6601.30 → 6602.20] four times
[6602.20 → 6604.02] because they keep
[6604.02 → 6606.04] just not showing up.
[6606.56 → 6607.78] And so we basically
[6607.78 → 6608.28] said,
[6608.40 → 6608.78] look,
[6608.82 → 6609.50] this is ridiculous.
[6609.50 → 6610.84] You'll be here on Monday
[6610.84 → 6612.12] and you will be working
[6612.12 → 6613.38] continuously until the
[6613.38 → 6614.20] project is done
[6614.20 → 6615.52] or we're going public.
[6616.24 → 6617.34] It's something I hate
[6617.34 → 6617.64] doing.
[6617.82 → 6619.20] I actually hate doing it.
[6619.34 → 6620.40] But this has actually
[6620.40 → 6621.40] been insane to the
[6621.40 → 6622.12] point of like,
[6622.44 → 6623.34] should be criminal.
[6623.96 → 6624.18] No,
[6624.24 → 6624.66] it is.
[6624.78 → 6624.98] Oh,
[6625.04 → 6625.22] okay.
[6625.40 → 6626.42] In my opinion.
[6626.96 → 6627.28] Ah.
[6628.22 → 6628.82] I don't need any
[6628.82 → 6630.00] libel or whatever.
[6630.12 → 6630.28] Yeah.
[6630.94 → 6631.46] But,
[6631.64 → 6632.36] but they have,
[6632.42 → 6633.02] they have,
[6633.24 → 6634.70] in my opinion,
[6634.70 → 6636.12] from my experience,
[6636.72 → 6638.20] almost certainly broken
[6638.20 → 6639.88] multiple laws in the way
[6639.88 → 6640.60] that they've engaged
[6640.60 → 6641.70] with us and they
[6641.70 → 6642.06] deserve,
[6642.46 → 6644.82] I think,
[6645.56 → 6646.80] to never be in
[6646.80 → 6647.40] business again.
[6647.48 → 6647.68] Yeah.
[6647.72 → 6648.26] At this point.
[6648.34 → 6649.06] From what I've heard,
[6649.10 → 6650.00] I completely agree.
[6650.12 → 6650.26] Yeah.
[6650.26 → 6650.52] So,
[6650.52 → 6651.86] so if,
[6651.96 → 6653.34] if nothing happens
[6653.34 → 6654.18] on Monday,
[6654.48 → 6655.46] I will,
[6655.62 → 6656.94] I'll see you guys on,
[6657.18 → 6658.04] I'll see you guys next
[6658.04 → 6659.20] Friday, and I'll let you
[6659.20 → 6659.88] know how it's going.
[6660.74 → 6662.02] There's another contractor
[6662.02 → 6663.38] that might be willing
[6663.38 → 6664.58] to pick up the job,
[6664.60 → 6665.90] but from,
[6665.90 → 6667.34] from looking at another
[6667.34 → 6668.42] review of these guys,
[6668.50 → 6669.72] even apparently it like
[6669.72 → 6670.76] took six months and was
[6670.76 → 6671.72] like pulling teeth to get
[6671.72 → 6672.62] a small job done.
[6672.74 → 6672.90] So,
[6673.30 → 6675.50] I don't know.
[6675.78 → 6676.58] I guess we'll see how
[6676.58 → 6677.00] it goes.
[6677.74 → 6678.18] Yeah.
[6678.44 → 6678.82] Yeah.
[6678.82 → 6680.04] Yeah.
[6680.58 → 6681.38] Hey DLL,
[6681.78 → 6682.70] picking up some merch
[6682.70 → 6684.10] for Linus Voice,
[6684.30 → 6684.96] my wife.
[6685.02 → 6685.84] That's not Linus Voice,
[6685.92 → 6686.86] that's Borat Voice,
[6687.14 → 6687.60] but anyway,
[6687.72 → 6687.94] yes.
[6688.34 → 6688.78] You're going to,
[6688.82 → 6689.38] you're going to do it?
[6689.50 → 6689.74] No.
[6689.98 → 6690.26] Okay.
[6690.78 → 6691.76] With the growing size of
[6691.76 → 6693.42] LTT and improving
[6693.42 → 6694.14] Mark Bench,
[6694.28 → 6695.26] what steps you're taking
[6695.26 → 6696.68] to ensure GPU reviews
[6696.68 → 6698.02] are free of errors?
[6698.16 → 6698.46] So,
[6698.66 → 6699.20] a couple of things
[6699.20 → 6699.66] we've added.
[6699.82 → 6699.96] So,
[6700.02 → 6700.14] okay,
[6700.22 → 6701.34] so one is,
[6701.60 → 6703.14] as we improve
[6703.14 → 6704.80] our machine vision
[6704.80 → 6705.52] capabilities,
[6706.04 → 6706.82] we are expecting
[6706.82 → 6708.28] to be able to monitor
[6708.28 → 6709.80] not just for
[6709.80 → 6711.08] anomalies in our results,
[6711.08 → 6712.30] but also anomalies
[6712.30 → 6714.06] in the visuals
[6714.06 → 6715.10] of the game.
[6715.68 → 6716.66] That's something
[6716.66 → 6718.68] that one of our team members
[6718.68 → 6720.16] actually has some experience
[6720.16 → 6722.56] with from testing mobile games
[6722.56 → 6723.90] at his previous job.
[6724.52 → 6725.96] And in the long term,
[6725.96 → 6727.36] we would like to be able
[6727.36 → 6729.72] to evaluate the visual fidelity
[6729.72 → 6731.58] of features like DLSS
[6731.58 → 6733.00] or FSR
[6733.00 → 6734.90] as part of the way
[6734.90 → 6736.52] that we present performance data
[6736.52 → 6737.70] for these GPUs.
[6738.54 → 6739.34] That's going to take
[6739.34 → 6740.30] a long time.
[6740.42 → 6740.88] For now,
[6740.98 → 6741.72] at the very least,
[6741.78 → 6742.42] we've implemented
[6742.42 → 6744.00] a checking stage
[6744.00 → 6744.68] where the labs
[6744.68 → 6746.58] goes through the data
[6746.58 → 6747.28] and goes through
[6747.28 → 6748.18] the finished videos
[6748.18 → 6749.12] to make sure
[6749.12 → 6749.88] that the writing team
[6749.88 → 6750.58] didn't miss anything.
[6750.64 → 6751.46] Not because the writing team
[6751.46 → 6752.44] is dumb or incompetent,
[6752.48 → 6753.28] but because it's often
[6753.28 → 6754.84] just crunch for these videos
[6754.84 → 6756.06] and things can get missed.
[6756.86 → 6758.70] It's improved things a lot,
[6758.80 → 6759.68] but there's still room
[6759.68 → 6760.36] for us to continue
[6760.36 → 6760.90] to improve.
[6763.34 → 6764.62] Hey, LLD,
[6764.98 → 6765.76] do you guys think
[6765.76 → 6766.72] any labs content
[6766.72 → 6767.80] will be at LTX?
[6767.92 → 6768.28] Personally,
[6768.38 → 6769.18] I'd love to see
[6769.18 → 6769.90] some of the stuff
[6769.90 → 6771.92] you all are working on demoed.
[6772.18 → 6772.64] For example,
[6772.80 → 6773.38] keyboard testing.
[6773.70 → 6774.90] That's a perfect question,
[6775.02 → 6775.54] and right now,
[6775.60 → 6776.28] the answer is no.
[6776.46 → 6777.44] I don't think we have
[6777.44 → 6779.08] anything planned for LTX.
[6779.16 → 6779.30] I mean,
[6779.34 → 6780.62] most of the labs' equipment
[6780.62 → 6781.46] is...
[6781.46 → 6782.54] Pretty planted.
[6782.74 → 6782.88] Yeah,
[6782.94 → 6784.22] kind of bolted to the ground.
[6785.70 → 6786.10] Huh.
[6786.22 → 6786.40] Yeah,
[6786.40 → 6786.88] I don't really know
[6786.88 → 6787.44] what to tell you.
[6787.96 → 6789.00] It could be interesting.
[6789.00 → 6792.00] I know PAX
[6792.00 → 6793.92] had some multi-site stuff
[6793.92 → 6794.70] some years.
[6795.42 → 6796.08] It could be interesting
[6796.08 → 6798.32] one year to have like...
[6798.32 → 6798.54] Oh,
[6798.58 → 6799.70] this would be really hard.
[6799.82 → 6800.14] I don't think
[6800.14 → 6800.78] we could do it, actually.
[6800.88 → 6801.00] Well,
[6801.02 → 6801.74] we're offering tours
[6801.74 → 6802.82] of the lab
[6802.82 → 6804.56] as part of LTX.
[6805.20 → 6805.60] Yeah.
[6805.78 → 6806.44] So there's that.
[6807.00 → 6807.18] I think,
[6807.26 → 6807.38] like,
[6807.42 → 6808.46] if you had,
[6808.46 → 6808.66] like,
[6808.68 → 6810.06] another event,
[6810.56 → 6811.16] which was like,
[6811.22 → 6812.38] you could go through
[6812.38 → 6813.58] some testing at the lab.
[6814.92 → 6816.12] We're not close to there,
[6816.16 → 6816.92] and that would be very hard
[6816.92 → 6817.78] and might not be feasible.
[6818.04 → 6818.32] Yeah.
[6818.32 → 6819.52] I have no guarantees
[6819.52 → 6820.04] on that one.
[6820.10 → 6820.64] It'd be neat,
[6820.78 → 6821.44] but it's probably
[6821.44 → 6822.10] never going to happen.
[6823.24 → 6823.42] Hey,
[6823.54 → 6824.04] LLD,
[6824.30 → 6825.40] I often watch videos
[6825.40 → 6826.24] over Discord,
[6826.50 → 6827.78] screen share with friends.
[6828.00 → 6828.94] Some sites block
[6828.94 → 6829.58] screen sharing
[6829.58 → 6830.28] in this way.
[6830.68 → 6831.54] What is your opinion
[6831.54 → 6832.24] of this practice,
[6832.42 → 6833.68] both as a consumer
[6833.68 → 6836.32] and as float plane executives?
[6836.32 → 6837.28] I totally get
[6837.28 → 6838.30] why people do it.
[6838.96 → 6839.52] Absolutely.
[6839.96 → 6840.62] And also,
[6840.82 → 6841.24] there is
[6841.24 → 6842.46] absolutely
[6842.46 → 6843.98] ways around it.
[6843.98 → 6846.78] how would you
[6846.78 → 6847.46] even block that?
[6848.70 → 6849.16] I mean,
[6849.44 → 6850.82] there are ways to...
[6850.82 → 6851.28] Oh, right.
[6851.36 → 6852.50] Block screen capture.
[6853.44 → 6853.70] Yeah.
[6853.82 → 6854.08] Okay.
[6854.14 → 6854.60] Well, anyway.
[6855.18 → 6855.86] I mean,
[6855.92 → 6856.72] I can tell you...
[6856.72 → 6857.34] If something shows up
[6857.34 → 6857.94] on your screen,
[6858.04 → 6858.64] there is a way
[6858.64 → 6859.26] to capture it.
[6859.80 → 6860.10] Yeah.
[6860.18 → 6860.58] I mean,
[6860.70 → 6861.42] oh,
[6861.68 → 6863.84] this is a tough one,
[6863.88 → 6864.10] right?
[6864.18 → 6865.66] Because as a consumer,
[6865.66 → 6866.58] I think it's super cool.
[6866.72 → 6867.52] It's one of the features
[6867.52 → 6868.76] that I actually pitched
[6868.76 → 6869.38] as something
[6869.38 → 6870.30] that would be really neat
[6870.30 → 6871.56] for float plane to have,
[6871.76 → 6873.14] like native support for.
[6875.24 → 6876.86] But I can tell you now
[6876.86 → 6877.94] that the creator
[6877.94 → 6879.44] of whatever that is
[6879.44 → 6880.70] is not being compensated
[6880.70 → 6881.60] in any way
[6881.60 → 6883.08] for whatever that is.
[6883.38 → 6883.94] So,
[6884.74 → 6885.96] take that for what it is,
[6885.98 → 6886.20] right?
[6886.52 → 6888.32] If you're enjoying
[6888.32 → 6889.04] this content,
[6889.56 → 6890.02] then
[6890.02 → 6892.28] the idea there
[6892.28 → 6892.90] is that
[6892.90 → 6893.42] you
[6893.42 → 6895.24] should
[6895.24 → 6896.48] maybe think
[6896.48 → 6897.16] that the person
[6897.16 → 6898.14] who created it
[6898.14 → 6899.22] should be compensated
[6899.22 → 6900.32] in some way
[6900.32 → 6902.20] or not.
[6902.32 → 6903.54] And that's kind of
[6903.54 → 6903.90] your call,
[6903.96 → 6904.16] right?
[6904.70 → 6905.78] But that's what's happening
[6905.78 → 6906.46] and that's why
[6906.46 → 6907.20] they block it.
[6907.50 → 6908.04] I don't think
[6908.04 → 6908.90] we're putting any effort
[6908.90 → 6910.12] into blocking it
[6910.12 → 6910.88] at this point in time,
[6910.98 → 6911.18] but
[6911.18 → 6913.50] we're also not
[6913.50 → 6915.18] a small creative team
[6915.18 → 6915.74] and we're not
[6915.74 → 6916.20] sort of
[6916.20 → 6917.78] live or die
[6917.78 → 6918.54] depending on
[6918.54 → 6919.36] whether we get that
[6919.36 → 6920.74] $100 check this month
[6920.74 → 6921.72] or whatever else it is,
[6921.74 → 6921.94] right?
[6922.00 → 6922.34] So,
[6923.34 → 6924.60] we're quite diversified.
[6925.46 → 6925.82] Yeah,
[6925.84 → 6926.14] it's tough.
[6926.14 → 6926.46] You just
[6926.46 → 6927.24] gotta
[6927.24 → 6928.76] think about
[6928.76 → 6929.26] what you're doing
[6929.26 → 6930.46] and understand
[6930.46 → 6931.10] the impact
[6931.10 → 6931.94] and make your call,
[6932.02 → 6932.18] right?
[6933.42 → 6933.58] Yep.
[6934.72 → 6935.12] Linus,
[6935.24 → 6935.86] what's with all
[6935.86 → 6936.64] the fancier,
[6936.84 → 6937.28] sillier,
[6937.48 → 6937.94] wordier
[6937.94 → 6938.80] videos lately?
[6940.08 → 6940.88] I don't know.
[6940.90 → 6941.54] It's just fun.
[6941.68 → 6942.46] It's just pure fun.
[6942.70 → 6943.48] I like it.
[6943.98 → 6945.12] I like silly words.
[6945.26 → 6945.98] I like grabbing
[6945.98 → 6946.52] your attention.
[6946.94 → 6947.18] Look,
[6947.22 → 6947.52] it worked.
[6948.94 → 6949.12] Yeah.
[6949.42 → 6950.06] I'm going to be
[6950.06 → 6950.52] in Taiwan
[6950.52 → 6951.46] for the next
[6951.46 → 6952.02] two weeks.
[6952.26 → 6952.68] I wonder why.
[6953.08 → 6953.94] Do you recommend
[6953.94 → 6954.90] somebody in the
[6954.90 → 6955.62] tech industry
[6955.62 → 6957.02] go to Computer
[6957.02 → 6957.68] for fun
[6957.68 → 6958.26] with their
[6958.26 → 6959.16] significant other
[6959.16 → 6959.76] or is it
[6959.76 → 6960.56] too formal?
[6960.78 → 6961.58] It's industry only.
[6962.54 → 6962.98] CES,
[6963.18 → 6963.64] or wait,
[6963.72 → 6963.82] no,
[6963.88 → 6964.22] is it?
[6964.66 → 6965.54] CES is.
[6965.76 → 6967.24] I can never remember.
[6967.42 → 6967.98] I'm pretty sure
[6967.98 → 6968.66] both of them,
[6968.76 → 6969.40] there is a way
[6969.40 → 6970.06] that you can buy
[6970.06 → 6970.50] a pass,
[6970.58 → 6971.08] but it's like
[6971.08 → 6972.04] really,
[6972.32 → 6972.90] really brutal.
[6972.90 → 6975.82] they say that
[6975.82 → 6976.20] I think they're
[6976.20 → 6976.72] in the tech
[6976.72 → 6977.58] industry already.
[6978.10 → 6978.32] So we could
[6978.32 → 6978.84] kind of like,
[6978.94 → 6979.88] they would just
[6979.88 → 6980.36] go.
[6980.50 → 6981.02] You're in the
[6981.02 → 6981.54] tech industry.
[6981.66 → 6982.38] They don't have
[6982.38 → 6982.74] to go.
[6982.74 → 6982.76] You're going to
[6982.76 → 6983.78] Taiwan right
[6983.78 → 6984.38] now,
[6984.70 → 6986.00] but you're not
[6986.00 → 6986.36] going to
[6986.36 → 6986.92] Computer.
[6987.48 → 6988.00] But they would
[6988.00 → 6988.96] go to Computer
[6988.96 → 6989.36] for fun.
[6989.36 → 6989.52] Oh,
[6989.58 → 6989.76] yeah.
[6989.84 → 6990.06] Okay.
[6990.12 → 6990.74] This is very
[6990.74 → 6991.16] strange.
[6991.46 → 6991.58] Oh,
[6991.64 → 6991.76] yeah.
[6991.84 → 6992.00] No.
[6992.22 → 6992.58] Yeah,
[6992.62 → 6992.94] of course.
[6993.12 → 6993.26] Yeah.
[6993.30 → 6993.46] Yeah.
[6993.46 → 6994.14] Computer is fun.
[6994.20 → 6994.42] It's cool.
[6994.82 → 6995.16] It is.
[6995.26 → 6995.36] Yeah.
[6995.42 → 6995.88] Go for it.
[6996.54 → 6997.00] See you there.
[6997.00 → 6999.70] Hello,
[6999.82 → 7000.94] Dan and Dan's
[7000.94 → 7001.76] assistance to
[7001.76 → 7002.24] the WAN show.
[7002.80 → 7003.42] I'm using the
[7003.42 → 7004.30] LTT screwdriver to
[7004.30 → 7005.76] perform jet engine
[7005.76 → 7006.48] maintenance currently.
[7006.48 → 7006.68] Nice.
[7006.92 → 7007.28] Sick.
[7007.40 → 7008.18] Where is the most
[7008.18 → 7009.18] interesting place you
[7009.18 → 7009.96] have found your
[7009.96 → 7011.26] merch being used?
[7011.28 → 7011.50] I mean,
[7011.54 → 7012.30] there was that time
[7012.30 → 7013.34] that Skating
[7013.34 → 7014.60] Olympian had our
[7014.60 → 7015.54] water bottle just
[7015.54 → 7016.50] like casually on
[7016.50 → 7017.40] TV in the Olympics.
[7017.80 → 7018.04] Yeah.
[7018.22 → 7018.48] Yeah.
[7018.60 → 7019.28] That was really cool.
[7020.28 → 7020.84] I'm trying to think.
[7020.92 → 7021.64] There's got to be
[7021.64 → 7022.52] some other cool stuff.
[7023.58 → 7024.52] Did any of the
[7024.52 → 7025.16] did any of the
[7025.16 → 7026.10] boys at NASA have
[7026.10 → 7026.80] any of our merch?
[7027.84 → 7028.24] Yeah.
[7028.56 → 7028.88] Okay.
[7029.20 → 7029.62] That's cool.
[7030.20 → 7030.90] I didn't actually
[7030.90 → 7031.86] see it on site,
[7031.94 → 7032.70] but we weren't like
[7032.70 → 7033.68] where they were
[7033.68 → 7034.34] doing that type of
[7034.34 → 7034.82] stuff anyway.
[7034.94 → 7035.14] Yeah.
[7035.30 → 7035.82] Might make sense.
[7037.62 → 7038.66] That we've seen a
[7038.66 → 7039.82] lot of people review
[7039.82 → 7041.00] the screwdriver that
[7041.00 → 7042.36] do really cool stuff.
[7042.74 → 7043.54] We saw the guy that
[7043.54 → 7044.20] works on drift cars
[7044.20 → 7044.60] in Japan.
[7044.64 → 7044.90] Oh,
[7044.94 → 7045.22] yeah.
[7045.86 → 7046.72] We've seen a bunch
[7046.72 → 7047.30] of different people
[7047.30 → 7048.84] that do a bunch of
[7048.84 → 7049.78] random stuff that
[7049.78 → 7050.28] they need a screwdriver
[7050.28 → 7050.58] for.
[7050.64 → 7051.32] It's been very cool.
[7052.06 → 7052.20] Yeah.
[7052.30 → 7052.96] It's a good screwdriver.
[7053.08 → 7053.56] What can I say?
[7053.72 → 7053.96] Yeah.
[7054.72 → 7055.54] There's a bunch in
[7055.54 → 7056.76] potential Linus that
[7056.76 → 7057.60] are pretty
[7057.60 → 7058.92] specifically directed
[7058.92 → 7059.28] at you.
[7059.42 → 7059.66] Oh,
[7059.86 → 7060.00] yeah.
[7060.00 → 7060.64] Go through potential.
[7060.64 → 7060.72] There's been some that are
[7060.72 → 7061.52] directed at you that I've
[7061.52 → 7062.70] been able to answer for
[7062.70 → 7062.90] you,
[7063.00 → 7063.56] but not all of them.
[7063.64 → 7063.90] Okay.
[7064.04 → 7064.86] Torrid asks,
[7064.96 → 7065.54] would you ever do an
[7065.54 → 7067.02] LTT Labs official quality
[7067.02 → 7068.36] certification for specific
[7068.36 → 7069.64] products like USB and
[7069.64 → 7070.00] HDMI?
[7070.00 → 7072.16] It depends.
[7072.38 → 7073.38] We'd have to find a way to
[7073.38 → 7074.32] do it where it doesn't
[7074.32 → 7075.56] compromise the labs'
[7075.78 → 7076.22] vision,
[7076.34 → 7078.78] which is to be a check
[7078.78 → 7080.66] and a balance on these
[7080.66 → 7082.96] certification bodies and
[7082.96 → 7084.48] this product manufacturing
[7084.48 → 7085.18] bodies.
[7085.86 → 7087.20] I think that,
[7087.28 → 7087.54] you know,
[7087.58 → 7088.44] something like the way
[7088.44 → 7090.04] that 80 plus operates
[7090.04 → 7092.40] theoretically is really
[7092.40 → 7092.72] good,
[7092.94 → 7095.58] but in practice has,
[7095.82 → 7098.80] I think,
[7098.86 → 7101.86] been less effective over
[7101.86 → 7104.04] more recent years.
[7104.04 → 7104.90] And I think that's where
[7104.90 → 7106.14] cybernetics has had an
[7106.14 → 7107.48] opportunity to step in and
[7107.48 → 7108.54] provide a more meaningful
[7108.54 → 7109.70] certification program.
[7109.70 → 7111.42] So if we were going to do
[7111.42 → 7111.74] something,
[7111.82 → 7112.58] I would just want to make
[7112.58 → 7113.88] sure that we're only doing
[7113.88 → 7116.60] it in an area where we have
[7116.60 → 7118.58] the time and attention to
[7118.58 → 7120.18] focus on making sure that we
[7120.18 → 7121.98] are the be all and end all of
[7121.98 → 7123.10] standards for that particular
[7123.10 → 7123.56] vertical.
[7123.80 → 7124.90] And that's a really
[7124.90 → 7125.92] challenging thing to do.
[7127.14 → 7128.52] It's going to take a long
[7128.52 → 7128.84] time.
[7129.92 → 7131.70] So I can archive that now.
[7132.26 → 7132.40] Hey,
[7132.44 → 7132.70] Linus,
[7132.76 → 7133.96] love the show and all the
[7133.96 → 7135.14] best with your new role.
[7135.40 → 7136.30] I was wondering if there were
[7136.30 → 7137.54] any upcoming videos for
[7137.54 → 7138.52] Channel Super Fun.
[7138.52 → 7139.60] Seems like it's on the
[7139.60 → 7140.70] back burner at the moment.
[7140.98 → 7143.16] The answer is you are
[7143.16 → 7143.40] right.
[7144.20 → 7145.52] It is on the back burner at
[7145.52 → 7145.84] the moment.
[7145.96 → 7147.28] Dennis has transitioned into a
[7147.28 → 7147.64] new role.
[7147.76 → 7149.80] So there is not a formal
[7149.80 → 7151.24] channel manager for Channel
[7151.24 → 7152.20] Super Fun right now.
[7152.24 → 7152.68] Unfortunately,
[7152.68 → 7154.60] it's just not been sustainable
[7154.60 → 7156.42] for us from a financial
[7156.42 → 7157.04] standpoint.
[7157.56 → 7160.16] That's business speak for we
[7160.16 → 7161.36] were losing money on it
[7161.36 → 7162.54] again.
[7163.74 → 7165.10] I don't know what it is.
[7165.10 → 7165.50] I,
[7165.64 → 7166.18] I,
[7166.26 → 7168.32] I always really enjoyed doing
[7168.32 → 7169.34] Channel Super Fun when it
[7169.34 → 7170.82] was just kind of hanging
[7170.82 → 7171.92] out and doing a weird
[7171.92 → 7172.74] challenge or whatever,
[7172.74 → 7173.28] but there's,
[7173.44 → 7176.16] there are a lot of things that
[7176.16 → 7177.20] come with being a bigger
[7177.20 → 7178.54] company that are not a lot
[7178.54 → 7179.02] of fun.
[7179.48 → 7179.86] Um,
[7180.02 → 7182.96] Channel Super Fun relied on
[7182.96 → 7186.34] just kind of spontaneity and,
[7186.34 → 7187.22] uh,
[7187.22 → 7188.92] people participating just for
[7188.92 → 7191.70] the sheer fun of it and not
[7191.70 → 7192.94] worrying too much about
[7192.94 → 7193.68] things like,
[7193.88 → 7194.14] okay,
[7194.22 → 7195.74] prizes are something that are
[7195.74 → 7196.24] really tough.
[7196.24 → 7197.20] like the meta has changed.
[7197.28 → 7198.32] People expect there to be
[7198.32 → 7200.48] like a giant prize for,
[7200.60 → 7201.44] give you a car,
[7201.56 → 7202.28] doing something.
[7202.40 → 7202.88] Uh,
[7202.88 → 7204.32] but we've done things kind of
[7204.32 → 7205.54] like that in the past,
[7205.54 → 7206.82] even with small prizes.
[7206.82 → 7208.18] So when we did the
[7208.18 → 7208.50] um,
[7208.62 → 7211.22] Mario Kart AR racing thing,
[7211.22 → 7211.82] okay,
[7211.82 → 7212.08] uh,
[7212.08 → 7212.70] on LTT,
[7212.70 → 7215.06] we offered people winning a
[7215.06 → 7216.16] day off or something like
[7216.16 → 7216.38] that.
[7216.38 → 7216.88] I think it was,
[7216.88 → 7217.36] I forget,
[7217.44 → 7218.44] I forget exactly what it
[7218.44 → 7219.84] was and the amount of
[7219.84 → 7222.58] backlash internally over not
[7222.58 → 7224.06] being selected to participate.
[7224.06 → 7225.76] So not getting a chance to win
[7225.76 → 7227.88] that led us to create this
[7227.88 → 7229.96] whole convoluted program for
[7229.96 → 7231.78] Channel Super Fun where the
[7231.78 → 7234.68] participants were actually
[7234.68 → 7236.28] competing for a prize,
[7236.28 → 7237.46] but then everyone else
[7237.46 → 7239.00] internally could bet on the
[7239.00 → 7240.90] outcome and share the prize
[7240.90 → 7242.54] with the participant who won.
[7242.62 → 7243.88] So that way everyone could
[7243.88 → 7244.78] participate.
[7244.78 → 7245.86] And that it's just,
[7246.08 → 7247.36] it basically,
[7248.00 → 7250.40] this is why we can't have nice
[7250.40 → 7252.70] things because it created a
[7252.70 → 7254.78] bunch of politics and,
[7254.78 → 7255.34] uh,
[7255.38 → 7255.60] you know,
[7255.72 → 7257.92] jockeying for being featured
[7257.92 → 7259.40] on the channel and complaining
[7259.40 → 7261.54] about not getting screen time
[7261.54 → 7262.56] or being in a role where
[7262.56 → 7263.82] you're not on-screen or
[7263.82 → 7264.32] whatever else.
[7264.36 → 7265.02] And I just like,
[7265.08 → 7266.24] I can't,
[7266.30 → 7267.34] I just can't anymore.
[7267.82 → 7268.18] Um,
[7268.18 → 7269.38] that's why a lot of,
[7269.54 → 7269.84] you know,
[7269.88 → 7270.72] I'm not going to name any
[7270.72 → 7271.14] specifics,
[7271.14 → 7272.64] but that's why a lot of those
[7272.64 → 7273.52] types of channels,
[7273.66 → 7274.40] the prizes,
[7274.64 → 7275.50] particularly when they're
[7275.50 → 7276.38] internal for the staff,
[7276.40 → 7277.16] it's just all fake.
[7277.16 → 7277.56] Like,
[7278.40 → 7279.02] come on guys,
[7279.06 → 7279.46] get real,
[7279.56 → 7279.82] right?
[7281.12 → 7282.18] What do you want from me?
[7282.70 → 7285.16] Let's keep churning through.
[7285.50 → 7285.66] Yeah.
[7285.82 → 7286.12] Linus,
[7286.18 → 7287.18] are you officially switching
[7287.18 → 7289.18] from the Steam Deck to the
[7289.18 → 7290.06] DOG Ally,
[7290.30 → 7291.80] planning a two terabyte SSD
[7291.80 → 7293.40] upgrade in the Ally with
[7293.40 → 7295.40] Sab rent's new 2230 two
[7295.40 → 7296.28] terabyte SSD?
[7297.02 → 7297.92] I think he's got one there.
[7298.42 → 7298.82] Um,
[7298.98 → 7300.58] Indoor Body restock when?
[7301.92 → 7302.18] Uh,
[7302.42 → 7302.82] soon.
[7303.18 → 7303.54] Soon.
[7303.66 → 7305.14] I think we've actually got it
[7305.14 → 7306.52] nailed down, and we're,
[7306.52 → 7306.78] we're,
[7306.86 → 7307.84] we're ready to go to mass
[7307.84 → 7308.22] production,
[7308.22 → 7308.98] but it's going to take a
[7308.98 → 7309.66] little bit more time.
[7310.22 → 7310.44] Uh,
[7310.44 → 7310.78] but yeah,
[7310.78 → 7310.98] I'm,
[7310.98 → 7312.00] I'm switching over to the
[7312.00 → 7312.20] Ally.
[7312.20 → 7313.34] I was actually on the
[7313.34 → 7314.90] Roneo next before the
[7314.90 → 7315.18] Ally.
[7315.38 → 7316.42] And one of the things I
[7316.42 → 7317.34] liked about it was that it
[7317.34 → 7319.20] had support for M.2 2280
[7319.20 → 7319.62] drives,
[7319.72 → 7320.44] full length drives.
[7320.58 → 7321.74] Although I think you could
[7321.74 → 7323.02] cram one in the Ally if you
[7323.02 → 7324.24] just had a little M.2
[7324.24 → 7325.40] extension thing.
[7325.46 → 7326.38] And I'd like to put a bigger
[7326.38 → 7327.32] drive in it if I could.
[7328.88 → 7330.24] Finally caught one of these
[7330.24 → 7330.82] early.
[7331.16 → 7331.36] Uh,
[7331.42 → 7333.10] Linus is a fellow fan of
[7333.10 → 7333.84] Cross Code.
[7333.92 → 7335.26] What was your opinion on the
[7335.26 → 7336.96] post game downloadable content?
[7337.48 → 7337.78] Um,
[7337.78 → 7338.92] and have you seen the in-depth
[7338.92 → 7340.86] videos of Radical Fish Games'
[7340.86 → 7341.48] new project?
[7341.86 → 7342.08] Uh,
[7342.08 → 7343.24] I didn't actually play the
[7343.24 → 7344.12] post game DLC.
[7344.54 → 7344.82] I,
[7344.90 → 7345.34] um,
[7345.92 → 7346.20] I just,
[7346.28 → 7347.64] I felt like the story ended in
[7347.64 → 7348.86] such a good place, and I was
[7348.86 → 7349.74] playing for the story,
[7349.78 → 7350.58] not for the dungeons.
[7350.58 → 7351.84] I actually found the dungeons a
[7351.84 → 7353.12] little tedious towards the end,
[7353.38 → 7354.90] especially that twin dungeon where
[7354.90 → 7357.54] you do one side, and then you come
[7357.54 → 7357.74] out,
[7357.84 → 7359.56] there's no story and character
[7359.56 → 7360.56] development whatsoever.
[7360.56 → 7361.90] And then you do the other side.
[7362.00 → 7362.28] It's like,
[7362.34 → 7362.68] Oh,
[7362.76 → 7363.40] what a grind.
[7363.40 → 7364.36] Um,
[7364.66 → 7365.98] like the puzzles were really
[7365.98 → 7366.46] creative.
[7366.58 → 7367.24] It's a really,
[7367.34 → 7368.50] really well done game,
[7368.50 → 7368.94] but,
[7369.08 → 7369.90] uh,
[7369.94 → 7370.10] I,
[7370.16 → 7371.52] I just didn't find anything that
[7371.52 → 7372.60] appealing about the DLC.
[7373.14 → 7373.54] Um,
[7373.68 → 7374.52] as for their new game,
[7374.54 → 7375.30] I haven't seen anything,
[7375.42 → 7377.00] but I will absolutely play it.
[7377.04 → 7378.68] I consider myself a Radical Fish
[7378.68 → 7379.36] fan.
[7380.86 → 7381.26] Hey,
[7381.38 → 7381.70] Dill,
[7381.78 → 7382.56] love the show.
[7382.68 → 7384.32] My fiancé and I have been playing
[7384.32 → 7385.42] It Takes Two and having a
[7385.42 → 7385.72] blast.
[7386.14 → 7387.14] What is the first game you and
[7387.14 → 7388.52] Yvonne ever played together?
[7388.74 → 7389.72] Any other recommendations?
[7390.72 → 7391.12] Uh,
[7391.40 → 7392.86] I want to say Pocket Tanks.
[7394.06 → 7394.50] Oh,
[7394.52 → 7395.10] that's adorable.
[7395.24 → 7395.74] Look at this.
[7395.84 → 7395.98] I,
[7396.02 → 7397.38] I just go on YouTube and look
[7397.38 → 7399.26] at us saying goodbye.
[7400.10 → 7400.38] Uh,
[7400.40 → 7400.64] not,
[7400.72 → 7401.68] not in the way that you think
[7401.68 → 7401.82] though,
[7401.88 → 7402.14] but yeah,
[7402.20 → 7404.06] Pocket Tanks is a super fun,
[7404.18 → 7406.18] just ultra casual game.
[7406.46 → 7407.30] Lots of,
[7407.38 → 7408.58] lots of different weapons and
[7408.58 → 7409.02] stuff.
[7409.48 → 7409.82] Uh,
[7409.82 → 7411.38] I think it's like five bucks or
[7411.38 → 7412.32] something like that.
[7412.34 → 7413.54] Assuming you can even find
[7413.54 → 7414.58] anywhere to buy it anymore.
[7414.58 → 7416.92] You can like to put up walls and
[7416.92 → 7418.74] there's all these like cool
[7418.74 → 7420.76] little like different weapons and
[7420.76 → 7421.98] stuff that you can use.
[7421.98 → 7423.38] And we,
[7423.40 → 7424.54] we've got to the point where
[7424.54 → 7426.00] it got like pretty intense and
[7426.00 → 7427.32] we got pretty good at it and
[7427.32 → 7428.60] stuff like here.
[7428.72 → 7428.82] Well,
[7428.82 → 7430.28] this must've been some kind of
[7430.28 → 7431.78] like area of effect weapon or
[7431.78 → 7432.18] something.
[7433.50 → 7434.02] Uh,
[7434.62 → 7436.06] yeah,
[7436.06 → 7437.24] this is pretty slow paced
[7437.24 → 7438.06] gameplay here,
[7438.18 → 7438.54] guys.
[7438.98 → 7439.30] Anyway,
[7439.40 → 7440.16] that doesn't really matter.
[7440.24 → 7440.70] The point is,
[7440.78 → 7440.84] yeah,
[7440.90 → 7441.36] Pocket Tanks.
[7441.54 → 7442.16] That's the first game we
[7442.16 → 7442.54] played together.
[7442.54 → 7442.98] I think.
[7443.60 → 7445.30] Would you have taken the leap to
[7445.30 → 7446.88] start a Linus media group if
[7446.88 → 7448.34] other outlets like LTT,
[7448.74 → 7449.34] Gamers Next,
[7449.46 → 7450.34] where Nexus,
[7450.88 → 7451.24] uh,
[7451.32 → 7453.60] hardware unboxed and MKBHD had
[7453.60 → 7454.58] existed at the time?
[7455.06 → 7457.14] I started LTT because my boss
[7457.14 → 7457.76] told me to.
[7458.76 → 7459.12] So,
[7461.24 → 7462.56] I guess so.
[7462.72 → 7463.98] The leap to LMG,
[7464.10 → 7464.96] not just LTT.
[7465.42 → 7465.64] Yeah.
[7465.74 → 7466.00] I mean,
[7466.08 → 7466.38] yeah,
[7466.46 → 7467.62] because other stuff did exist
[7467.62 → 7468.22] at the time.
[7468.52 → 7468.62] There,
[7468.66 → 7469.58] there were other channels.
[7469.74 → 7470.22] There was.
[7470.32 → 7471.14] They just didn't happen to be
[7471.14 → 7471.68] those.
[7471.92 → 7472.12] Yeah.
[7473.64 → 7474.04] Linus,
[7474.08 → 7474.38] uh,
[7474.38 → 7475.62] seems like you have had bad
[7475.62 → 7476.94] luck with contractors for your
[7476.94 → 7477.22] house.
[7477.34 → 7477.52] Oh,
[7477.58 → 7478.02] oh God.
[7478.20 → 7478.56] Thanks for that.
[7479.08 → 7479.48] Painters,
[7479.84 → 7480.30] pool people,
[7480.74 → 7481.86] how can you find good
[7481.86 → 7483.72] contractors or trade workers?
[7483.92 → 7485.26] It's like interviewing anyone.
[7485.48 → 7486.28] You're going to get it right
[7486.28 → 7487.16] sometimes, and you're going to
[7487.16 → 7488.24] get it wrong sometimes.
[7488.56 → 7491.58] And while theoretically,
[7492.00 → 7492.34] you know,
[7492.36 → 7493.80] you have the law on your side
[7493.80 → 7494.28] or whatever,
[7494.28 → 7496.12] and you can hold people
[7496.12 → 7497.32] accountable in practice.
[7497.32 → 7498.14] This is like,
[7498.30 → 7498.60] this is,
[7498.70 → 7499.72] it's the whole trust me bro
[7499.72 → 7501.12] thing all over again.
[7501.26 → 7501.42] Yeah,
[7501.44 → 7501.94] that's right.
[7501.98 → 7502.96] I'm going there.
[7504.10 → 7504.54] Um,
[7505.06 → 7505.36] Luke,
[7505.44 → 7505.90] deep breaths.
[7507.22 → 7508.54] At the end of the day,
[7508.54 → 7510.26] at the end of the day,
[7510.40 → 7514.24] a warranty or a law or anything
[7514.24 → 7517.24] only exists to the extent to
[7517.24 → 7518.48] which it's enforceable.
[7518.48 → 7520.56] One party has the
[7520.68 → 7523.58] has the willingness to honour the
[7523.58 → 7525.52] agreement and the other party
[7525.52 → 7528.50] has the willingness and time
[7528.50 → 7530.80] and capability to force the other
[7530.80 → 7532.16] to honour the agreement.
[7532.16 → 7535.24] It can be life ruining level
[7535.24 → 7537.92] expensive to actually try to get a
[7537.92 → 7539.82] company to follow through with
[7539.82 → 7541.70] what they're legally supposed to do.
[7541.82 → 7543.28] And I know you're about to say,
[7543.40 → 7543.68] well,
[7543.74 → 7544.28] clean court.
[7544.72 → 7545.20] Sure.
[7545.36 → 7545.86] You do it.
[7546.02 → 7547.24] Are you going to?
[7547.98 → 7548.76] And full will.
[7548.76 → 7551.66] And then when you're done and they
[7551.66 → 7553.22] have that court order to pay you.
[7553.86 → 7554.34] Okay.
[7555.06 → 7557.26] Then what are you going to pursue
[7557.26 → 7558.60] them to actually write you the
[7558.60 → 7558.88] check?
[7559.18 → 7562.08] What if they're fraudsters and
[7562.08 → 7564.06] they've been Ponzi scheming the
[7564.06 → 7565.62] whole thing and their checks just
[7565.62 → 7566.40] going to bounce anyway.
[7566.70 → 7567.16] How,
[7567.24 → 7568.68] how are you going to follow that up?
[7568.68 → 7570.44] it just,
[7571.40 → 7573.86] yeah.
[7574.70 → 7575.22] Um,
[7576.18 → 7578.38] it is what it is.
[7578.52 → 7578.82] I were,
[7579.00 → 7579.26] you know,
[7579.32 → 7579.46] we're,
[7579.60 → 7579.72] we,
[7579.72 → 7581.64] we hope that we're going to get this
[7581.64 → 7582.50] resolved in a
[7582.62 → 7583.54] in an amicable way,
[7583.62 → 7585.24] but I don't,
[7585.36 → 7585.80] I don't know.
[7587.06 → 7587.50] Hi,
[7587.56 → 7588.00] LLD.
[7588.26 → 7590.42] I have a hybrid smartwatch with an
[7590.42 → 7592.44] e-ink display behind a set of
[7592.44 → 7592.96] dials,
[7592.96 → 7595.60] which has most smartwatch
[7595.60 → 7597.44] functionality and one month of
[7597.44 → 7598.12] battery life.
[7598.60 → 7598.80] Linus,
[7598.84 → 7600.74] would you use such a watch as a
[7600.74 → 7601.74] Pebble successor?
[7603.24 → 7603.64] Um,
[7604.30 → 7606.14] what was great about the Pebble was
[7606.14 → 7607.42] just the simplicity of it.
[7607.44 → 7610.74] It just showed me the text when a
[7610.74 → 7612.60] message arrived, and it had
[7612.60 → 7613.48] hardware buttons.
[7614.06 → 7614.42] Uh,
[7614.48 → 7615.10] that's,
[7615.22 → 7617.22] that's something that I still miss.
[7617.24 → 7619.10] I actually still use a Pebble time
[7619.10 → 7620.06] for,
[7620.06 → 7620.60] uh,
[7620.60 → 7622.08] media control on my motorbike.
[7622.20 → 7624.02] I just have a Pebble time just like
[7624.02 → 7625.92] magneted to my handlebars.
[7626.50 → 7627.42] Cause when I got gloves on,
[7627.44 → 7629.36] it's still like the only thing I can
[7629.36 → 7629.64] control.
[7629.72 → 7631.08] I think there are accessories that
[7631.08 → 7632.44] function in much the same way,
[7632.78 → 7633.10] but like,
[7633.68 → 7634.80] but I have a Pebble time and who
[7634.80 → 7635.04] cares?
[7635.16 → 7636.50] And the app is already on my,
[7636.56 → 7636.70] uh,
[7636.70 → 7637.30] my old phone,
[7637.38 → 7638.76] which is what I use to listen to
[7638.76 → 7639.96] music when I'm riding my bike.
[7640.00 → 7641.76] So it works perfectly for me.
[7642.58 → 7643.82] And it looks like the last one I
[7643.82 → 7644.24] have today.
[7644.44 → 7646.32] When you start someone as a new
[7646.32 → 7646.68] host,
[7646.76 → 7648.62] how do you evaluate whether they're a
[7648.62 → 7650.18] good fit to stay in the role?
[7650.32 → 7652.48] Do you give them specific training or
[7652.48 → 7654.10] is it just sink or swim?
[7654.96 → 7656.16] A little bit of column A,
[7656.16 → 7657.18] a little bit of column B.
[7657.54 → 7657.92] I mean,
[7658.00 → 7659.22] the audience is going to give them
[7659.22 → 7660.36] all the feedback they could ever
[7660.36 → 7660.80] hope for.
[7661.02 → 7661.20] So,
[7662.16 → 7662.76] Hey,
[7663.18 → 7664.00] thanks guys.
[7664.44 → 7665.38] Some of it valid.
[7665.50 → 7667.22] Some of it phenomenally stupid.
[7669.00 → 7669.44] Uh,
[7669.54 → 7671.08] LTT screwdriver been using a bunch
[7671.08 → 7671.38] lately.
[7671.54 → 7672.66] Any updates on metrics,
[7672.78 → 7673.00] hex,
[7673.24 → 7673.62] metric,
[7673.84 → 7676.02] hex bits and the stubby version?
[7676.44 → 7676.62] Uh,
[7676.62 → 7676.78] yeah.
[7676.84 → 7677.44] Metric hex,
[7677.52 → 7677.84] uh,
[7677.84 → 7680.04] doesn't seem to be here yet that I'm
[7680.04 → 7681.30] as up to date on that as you are.
[7681.36 → 7682.46] You can message support though,
[7682.46 → 7683.62] and hopefully they can get you sorted
[7683.62 → 7683.88] out.
[7684.08 → 7685.70] And I do have another small little
[7685.70 → 7686.62] update on the store.
[7686.96 → 7687.24] Uh,
[7687.32 → 7689.90] Zach actually announced an LTT colour
[7689.90 → 7691.76] version of the Jerry rig,
[7691.84 → 7693.08] everything razor knife.
[7693.20 → 7694.52] So we don't have it in stock yet.
[7694.98 → 7695.42] Apparently.
[7696.10 → 7697.14] Thanks Zach.
[7697.82 → 7698.22] Um,
[7698.30 → 7700.66] but we're going to have it and,
[7700.86 → 7701.02] uh,
[7701.02 → 7702.60] you guys can check out,
[7702.74 → 7704.16] I think it's his most recent video
[7704.16 → 7705.00] where he announced that.
[7705.08 → 7705.68] So that's pretty cool.
[7705.86 → 7705.98] Cool.
[7705.98 → 7709.80] And I think that's pretty much it for
[7709.80 → 7710.24] today.
[7711.00 → 7711.62] Sorry guys.
[7711.64 → 7712.42] It has to be a short show.
[7712.48 → 7713.38] We got to get to the airport.
[7713.66 → 7714.74] See you again next week.
[7715.60 → 7715.98] Oh,
[7716.70 → 7717.88] same bad time,
[7718.50 → 7719.24] different,
[7719.42 → 7720.88] bad location,
[7721.30 → 7722.18] but same channel,
[7722.42 → 7722.96] same channel.
[7723.00 → 7723.80] I'll still be here.
[7724.62 → 7725.02] Bye.
[7735.98 → 7746.74] Thanks.
[7746.74 → 7746.78] Thanks,
[7746.84 → 7747.16] Jessie,
[7747.26 → 7747.76] Signal Wire,
[7747.88 → 7749.48] and Corsair for sponsoring the show.
[7765.98 → 7766.68] Love заявing research.
[7766.70 → 7767.66] Bye.
[7771.56 → 7771.74] Thanks.
[7771.74 → 7772.66] Bye.
[7772.72 → 7774.64] Bye.
[7786.98 → 7787.84] Bye.
[7791.86 → 7791.92] Bye.
[7792.26 → 7792.80] Bye.
[7792.80 → 7794.96] Bye.
