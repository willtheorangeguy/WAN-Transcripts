[0.00 --> 9.00]  What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN show!
[9.26 --> 14.30]  We've got a great show for you guys this week, which is fortunate because yesterday evening
[14.30 --> 18.30]  I was sitting at the, looking at the doc going, what on earth are we going to talk about?
[18.40 --> 20.76]  And then we had one of the wildest Fridays ever.
[21.22 --> 22.98]  Advertisers are pulling out of Twitter.
[24.12 --> 27.68]  Sam Altman is out as the CEO of OpenAI.
[27.94 --> 29.92]  I mean, who could have seen either of these things coming?
[30.00 --> 31.08]  What else we got this week, Luke?
[34.02 --> 37.40]  Fortnite banned skins for little kids.
[37.56 --> 39.64]  And people are upset about it and I think it's hilarious.
[40.20 --> 41.26]  Yeah, I don't know.
[42.12 --> 43.38]  You took the good ones.
[43.50 --> 45.06]  You take the good ones every time.
[45.78 --> 47.06]  What do you want?
[47.06 --> 50.80]  What about the blue bubbles on nothing Android phones?
[51.16 --> 53.94]  And all Android phones, maybe, RCS something.
[55.26 --> 56.42]  Yeah, that's actually pretty cool.
[56.42 --> 60.42]  There might not be any bubble color elitism soon.
[60.62 --> 61.04]  We'll see.
[61.30 --> 62.78]  I'm sure they'll find another way.
[63.12 --> 66.04]  And I didn't even take that Amazon's going to be selling cars.
[67.00 --> 67.96]  Oh, I don't care about that.
[67.96 --> 69.40]  Would you download a car from Amazon?
[70.88 --> 71.28]  No.
[71.42 --> 72.82]  No, but I would download this intro.
[72.82 --> 78.76]  It's not on YouTube.
[83.98 --> 84.42]  What?
[84.42 --> 84.48]  What?
[84.48 --> 97.84]  The show is brought to you today by Kudos Forum and Green Man Gaming.
[98.56 --> 101.44]  Why don't we jump right into our first topic of the day?
[101.44 --> 104.92]  Unfortunately, this is very much a developing story.
[105.04 --> 112.68]  We don't know a ton about it other than that Sam Altman is out as CEO of OpenAI.
[113.82 --> 118.54]  Oh, my news source here says fired.
[119.08 --> 120.38]  Oh, yes, that's true.
[120.56 --> 121.54]  Okay, we do know that.
[121.54 --> 129.64]  The board has ousted Altman for allegedly lying to them, which I guess would make it pretty hard to do your job.
[129.76 --> 137.44]  They claim that they no longer have confidence in his ability to lead, and they now need an Altman.
[137.44 --> 141.12]  I added that last part.
[141.34 --> 142.08]  That was me.
[142.32 --> 144.06]  I take full responsibility for that.
[145.64 --> 155.50]  They say his departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications.
[156.24 --> 158.78]  So not only did they fire him, they fired him.
[159.02 --> 160.04]  They called him a liar.
[160.84 --> 161.36]  Dang.
[161.36 --> 172.86]  It's not really clear at this time what Mr. Altman is alleged to have hidden from the board, but OpenAI CTO Mira Maradi has taken over as the interim CEO.
[173.34 --> 174.44]  Sam did tweet.
[174.56 --> 177.02]  He says, I loved my time at OpenAI.
[177.38 --> 181.38]  It was transformative for me personally and hopefully the world a little bit.
[181.74 --> 184.52]  Most of all, I loved working with such talented people.
[184.78 --> 187.58]  We'll have more to say about what's next later.
[187.58 --> 195.44]  Our discussion question here is, how big of a deal is this, and will it affect the long and short-term future of AI development?
[195.68 --> 197.70]  I think, oh, he's already ready.
[197.84 --> 198.70]  He's ready to talk.
[198.86 --> 200.12]  He's opening up the chest.
[200.32 --> 201.52]  He's inhaling the air.
[201.72 --> 202.88]  He's ready to let it out.
[204.04 --> 206.04]  Yeah, I think it's an extremely big deal.
[206.12 --> 207.72]  I think it's a big deal for a bunch of reasons.
[207.88 --> 209.68]  OpenAI is clearly a market leader.
[209.68 --> 216.80]  And Greg Brockman, the co-founder and president of OpenAI, stepped down as well.
[217.52 --> 218.82]  So Sam was fired.
[219.26 --> 226.52]  Greg Brockman stepped down just hours after Sam was fired, immediately quitting.
[226.52 --> 245.78]  And I think this is going to spell probably a lot of other people at OpenAI stepping down, which I don't think is going to necessarily result in the destruction of the market leader of OpenAI, just due to the amount of money and backing that Microsoft is able to put behind this.
[245.78 --> 251.06]  But it is a pretty major blow.
[251.96 --> 257.90]  If Silicon Valley has a golden boy right now, it is Sam Altman for sure.
[258.88 --> 270.02]  So to have him outed like this and to have some really big names from OpenAI, I'm saying some right now because I suspect by the time the majority of people watch this, some will be true.
[270.02 --> 272.10]  Right now, as far as I know, it's only one.
[272.46 --> 282.96]  But having the CEO and the co-founder slash president both disappear within a few hours, I think that's going to end up sending waves and result in more than just those people.
[282.96 --> 286.30]  Greg Brockman's statement is pretty savage.
[287.12 --> 287.64]  Hi, everyone.
[287.92 --> 291.78]  I'm super proud of what we've all built together since starting in my apartment eight years ago.
[291.96 --> 296.84]  We've been through tough and great times together, accomplishing so much despite all the reasons it should have been impossible.
[296.84 --> 300.18]  But based on today's news, I quit.
[302.10 --> 302.62]  Damn!
[303.80 --> 305.80]  Just straight into the point.
[306.86 --> 306.98]  Yeah.
[307.22 --> 312.46]  There's another paragraph, but that was really, that was the meat and potatoes of it.
[313.16 --> 313.80]  Wow!
[314.54 --> 316.62]  That is absolutely wild.
[316.76 --> 319.38]  I mean, this is, guys, for context, okay?
[319.38 --> 327.88]  This is like if in the 90s, the board had kicked out Bill Gates and Ballmer had been like, f*** it, I'm out.
[328.54 --> 331.02]  Like, here goes the founder.
[331.42 --> 332.84]  Here goes the right-hand man.
[333.36 --> 334.22]  It's over.
[335.86 --> 342.56]  With that said, I mean, there are some people that I've seen compare Sam Altman to Steve Jobs.
[342.56 --> 347.00]  I don't know that they mean that in a flattering way or a negative way.
[347.18 --> 351.96]  There were certainly things about Mr. Jobs that were both good and admirable.
[353.80 --> 360.62]  But the good thing about this is that it gives him a chance to have a very similar arc.
[361.72 --> 363.62]  So I see this as an absolute win.
[364.76 --> 366.76]  This all happened, like, right now.
[366.76 --> 378.06]  I just got a shared from Handyman in Fullplane Chat, a post from Axios.com, which I don't know if I can share with Linus for screen sharing reasons right now very easily.
[378.20 --> 379.08]  But I'm going to try.
[379.46 --> 382.54]  I'm just going to post it right here.
[383.42 --> 384.88]  Oh, it's suggestion-based.
[385.04 --> 387.08]  I had this removed before.
[388.06 --> 390.56]  And then I guess my rights were taken from me.
[390.64 --> 392.12]  But there's a suggestion in the doc.
[393.04 --> 394.24]  Maybe I'm being ousted.
[394.24 --> 401.94]  But, yeah, apparently Microsoft didn't even know this was happening because it happened from the board.
[402.46 --> 407.52]  And the board, as far as my understanding goes, again, we don't have a ton of notes on this because this, like, just happened.
[407.74 --> 413.56]  But the board is comprised of people that actually don't have stock in the company.
[414.10 --> 417.54]  So Microsoft invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, as Axios said.
[417.58 --> 418.74]  What, they didn't get a board seat?
[418.74 --> 420.40]  And didn't know that the CEO was being ousted.
[420.56 --> 421.44]  Are you kidding me?
[421.92 --> 423.28]  They don't have a board seat?
[423.70 --> 424.06]  Yeah.
[424.80 --> 425.34]  Not sure.
[425.38 --> 434.00]  Okay, so guys, just for some context, you are not necessarily a member of the board of directors just because you are an investor.
[434.66 --> 439.74]  And you are not necessarily an investor just because you are a member of the board of directors.
[439.74 --> 443.28]  But correct me if I am wrong here.
[443.28 --> 463.72]  Typically, it is expected that there's some skin in the game for you to be in such a position of power such that you can vote on the actions of the company at a level that is assuming you have a unanimous decision or even a majority decision above the level of CEO.
[463.72 --> 479.56]  And also that if you are spending the kind of time and energy that it would take to be a functioning member of the board of directors that you'd probably be interested in having some skin in the game, assuming that the company wasn't shit and actually had a chance.
[479.56 --> 479.78]  Right.
[479.78 --> 485.66]  So there tends to be a lot of overlap there.
[485.66 --> 486.66]  Okay.
[486.66 --> 487.66]  Okay.
[487.66 --> 487.86]  Okay.
[487.86 --> 517.86] 
[517.86 --> 547.86] 
[547.86 --> 577.86] 
[577.86 --> 607.86] 
[607.86 --> 637.86] 
[637.86 --> 667.86] 
[667.86 --> 670.18]  So you're not going to be building hype and investor interest in your company.
[670.50 --> 671.10]  That's fair.
[671.10 --> 678.54]  so like i i don't think i don't think it's going to be hard or investor yeah representative
[678.54 --> 683.30]  pretty much i well i i think that's effectively what that role is for a lot of those
[683.30 --> 691.98]  type of companies um so i i'm sure this is not the end of mr altman um as far as hearing from
[691.98 --> 699.36]  and about him um i'm sure there will be something next i wouldn't be surprised i have no idea i
[699.36 --> 703.60]  have no idea but i wouldn't be surprised people are saying like oh we're gonna see a steve jobs
[703.60 --> 708.40]  moment where like he's outed and then he comes back uh if i had to put my prediction hat on i
[708.40 --> 713.72]  think the coming back um i wouldn't be too surprised if it was with microsoft more properly
[713.72 --> 720.50]  i was gonna say if microsoft just hires him and then just buys open ai outright i could see something
[720.50 --> 724.42]  like that i could see something like that potentially but that depends i mean again
[724.42 --> 731.08]  this comes down to not having researched or not fully understanding the nuances of how the whole
[731.08 --> 738.76]  non-profit part of this works it's possible that this board would be able to prevent such an
[738.76 --> 744.82]  acquisition from taking place whereas in the case of something like a public company um they might not
[744.82 --> 751.28]  be able to stop it as long as the acquisition was in the best interest of the individual investors who
[751.28 --> 755.78]  hold the shares of the company right like those are rules that i i do have a bit more knowledge
[755.78 --> 764.08]  about but in this case i'm i'm in kind of uncharted territory here because this is a super weird uh
[764.08 --> 768.64]  this is it's like it's a super weird corporate structure the fact that they started out as this
[768.64 --> 775.26]  non-profit and then my understanding is they created a for-profit entity that the non-profit owns and
[775.26 --> 783.58]  controls which is like okay what really yeah how are you not how are you a non-profit okay okay so
[783.58 --> 790.82]  hold on luke linus media group incorporated is a non-profit but linus tech tips the youtube channel
[790.82 --> 795.26]  totally for profit give me that money money money money money money money money money money money
[795.26 --> 803.60]  money and i mean if linus media group happens to make money then i guess we chill right
[803.60 --> 810.24]  i mean yeah we're not gonna take it we're just gonna leave it we're gonna leave it in ltt ink
[810.24 --> 817.28]  it's just there we didn't make that they they they made it and we're just gonna we're gonna leave
[817.28 --> 822.94]  it there we're not gonna but i'll never touch it i promise like i i don't know it just seems like a
[822.94 --> 828.92]  super weird structure yeah someone uh king hippo and full plane chat said exactly how firefox and mozilla
[828.92 --> 836.92]  work um that's cool but i think the finances running through open ai are a little bit more intense
[836.92 --> 846.62]  um sick all right anyway anyway there's a lot for us to talk about this week so we could sit and
[846.62 --> 850.56]  speculate about what this means forever but i don't think we're going to be able to why don't we move on
[850.56 --> 864.56]  to luke's chosen topic fortnite is restricting access to certain skins wow oh man dang it fortnite
[864.56 --> 872.72]  how dare you it's so juicy uh yesterday fortnite fortnite players found that skins in their locker
[872.72 --> 878.64]  had a new warning symbol on them alongside a notice that those items could be used could only be used in
[878.64 --> 888.70]  areas rated 12 plus uh for teens only 12 that count as a teen i don't think i guess um the the change
[888.70 --> 893.66]  was made without warning but epic games has since confirmed that only around seven percent of their
[893.66 --> 899.76]  skin library are now age restricted the consensus consensus among players is that skins featuring
[899.76 --> 905.74]  specific weaponry like pistols or knives are the ones that are going to be restricted from islands with a
[905.74 --> 911.52]  lower age rating oddly skins like michael myers the fictional serial killer are not actually
[911.52 --> 916.84]  restricted uh because i guess he's just wearing a mask um yeah what's wrong with a hockey player that's
[916.84 --> 924.98]  ken dryden true yeah according to epic next year skins will uh be able to auto adjust in appearance
[924.98 --> 931.40]  depending on the rating of the area epic has been accused of oh this is a totally different thing
[931.40 --> 939.68]  um epic has been accused of nerfing omni man's uh but is his glutes uh his glutes are rather flat
[939.68 --> 947.82]  in the epic avatar um i don't know how this has anything to do with the previous part of this but
[947.82 --> 954.38]  uh there's a question saying should epic return omni man's cake uh and i think yeah why not um
[954.38 --> 960.72]  i i just thought this was like funny because the discussion question was these skins have
[960.72 --> 966.66]  significant monetary value to the kids who bought them should they be offered a refund on their value
[966.66 --> 972.28]  this is the big one for me because if we're going to talk about i mean yeah sure
[972.28 --> 978.38]  are adults buying them come on i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding if you guys buy fortnite skins
[978.38 --> 985.56]  that's fine i get it but oh i see yeah my my my point is like this is i think the real conversation
[985.56 --> 994.02]  here is if if you're going to treat your digital merchandise like it has some kind of value the same
[994.02 --> 1000.66]  way that physical merchandise would then i think it's not an entirely unfair expectation as the buyer
[1000.66 --> 1008.26]  of aforementioned merchandise that it should if it doesn't retain its value necessarily retain
[1008.26 --> 1015.64]  its other intrinsic qualities over some period of time and i think we saw this play out we saw this
[1015.64 --> 1023.26]  expectation play out that a skin would continue to operate the same way that it did in the past
[1023.26 --> 1030.18]  when valve launched cs2 they didn't have to make the skins carry over from csgo to cs2
[1030.18 --> 1036.14]  but i think they correctly assessed that the community outcry would be immense if all of a sudden
[1036.14 --> 1042.30]  people weren't going to be able to enjoy the skins that they've spent ten dollars a hundred dollars a
[1042.30 --> 1047.72]  thousand dollars ten thousand dollars on from a day-to-day basis and some for some people that
[1047.72 --> 1053.48]  enjoyment means playing with them for other people that enjoyment just means looking at their
[1053.48 --> 1059.24]  collection right like we can't i'm not here to i'm not here to judge the the value of collecting skins
[1059.24 --> 1066.36]  right now i think i've said enough on that in the past but what i will judge is the company's
[1066.36 --> 1074.10]  responsibility to maintain some level of continuity for that product that you have purchased and i
[1074.10 --> 1081.20]  honestly think this kind of sucks i get what they're trying to do they're recognizing that the game
[1081.20 --> 1086.12]  it's not restricted for the whole game though it's it's restricted specifically for islands that have a
[1086.12 --> 1091.96]  i don't know anything about fortnite but i think islands are like custom games i don't think they're
[1092.62 --> 1100.48]  um like standard matches and it's for islands that have a a low age range um
[1100.48 --> 1106.60]  yeah it's not it's not like they took the skins from them you can still play the main game you can
[1106.60 --> 1112.12]  still play probably the vast majority of the game um just not islands that are age restricted to 12 okay
[1112.12 --> 1120.28]  counterpoint let's say you paid for an expensive vr chat avatar to be created for you and all of a
[1120.28 --> 1126.42]  sudden vr chat came to you and said okay yeah you can't you can't wear that skin in you know certain
[1126.42 --> 1132.96]  age group um chat rooms i have a strong feeling there are probably vr chat avatars that probably
[1132.96 --> 1138.64]  shouldn't be available okay but i was getting i was getting to that i was getting to that look there
[1138.64 --> 1144.82]  are two obvious counterpoints to this one is if you're an adult hanging out in like a minor's you
[1144.82 --> 1149.46]  know chat room or whatever then quite frankly it should have nothing to do with the avatar you're
[1149.46 --> 1155.66]  wearing you probably just shouldn't be there okay number one so i'm talking about kids who own this
[1155.66 --> 1163.74]  this skin right okay okay we chill we good number two is in my example that was a third party skin
[1163.74 --> 1170.42]  but this is a first party skin so this is as though vr chat themselves had a service where you
[1170.42 --> 1175.92]  can buy an avatar and then all of a sudden you can't wear it to your favorite chat room or island or
[1175.92 --> 1180.92]  whatever the case may be because my understanding is these islands can in many cases contain social
[1180.92 --> 1187.32]  experiences as well as just you know raw hardcore gaming experience is that correct i am not a fortnite
[1187.32 --> 1192.46]  expert i don't even pretend to be one no clue one of the thing that confuses one of the things that
[1192.46 --> 1198.92]  confuses me the most about this um as someone who doesn't know anything about fortnite um is even
[1198.92 --> 1207.78]  the box art has guns on it doesn't it i think so like doesn't the aren't the people standing next to
[1207.78 --> 1216.34]  the the fortnite logo don't they have firearms and then like if they can play like is there actually
[1216.34 --> 1222.26]  an account for fortnite where you can't actually play the battle royale yeah like they have there's a
[1222.26 --> 1225.72]  there's a shotgun right next to the logo
[1225.72 --> 1233.66]  like like part of part of me is like yeah sure i don't know maybe they they should be able to have
[1233.66 --> 1240.64]  age-restricted skins for like kid lobbies but what why is why is anyone maybe on those islands they're
[1240.64 --> 1247.24]  walkie-talkies but but like you have to click on the thing to launch the game like you'd have to go
[1247.24 --> 1252.88]  into the epic game store which uses tiles for for their game launching if i remember correctly it's
[1252.88 --> 1262.04]  been a while since i've used it um but like well i just i don't know i i feel like once you even like
[1262.04 --> 1270.20]  the loading screen to launch the game i i feel like probably has firearms on it um it's i don't know i
[1270.20 --> 1279.24]  i understand the idea of trying to consider what content is going to be available in kid lobbies
[1279.24 --> 1287.16]  i deeply question the idea of fortnite having kid lobbies at all um it doesn't make any sense to me
[1287.16 --> 1293.90]  here's an example so farming simulator okay so here's an island you can go to crafting survival
[1293.90 --> 1299.34]  grow and sell crops rated everyone mild fantasy violence you'll have to launch the game
[1299.34 --> 1301.36]  4v4 team fight teen
[1301.36 --> 1316.76]  yeah i don't know this just seems like the kind of thing that was probably a lot of development effort
[1316.76 --> 1322.86]  when it would have been simpler to just put a disclaimer that says okay kids don't don't use this
[1322.86 --> 1327.82]  and then the kids just would just like they always did and then everyone could have just kind of gotten
[1327.82 --> 1334.38]  gone about their day um but maybe i'm maybe i'm missing something here yeah i don't know you could
[1334.38 --> 1342.64]  make it so that anyone with a kid account um can't see the skins um that are restricted if you're on one
[1342.64 --> 1348.44]  of those islands oh here it was like or something one of our children on staff ariel from the lab says
[1348.44 --> 1354.68]  i'm 90 sure that skins are banned in the main game uh which is where most of the players are so 12 plus
[1354.68 --> 1360.24]  islands are rare wait what skins are banned in the main game
[1360.24 --> 1365.98]  well not all okay ariel what are you talking about i'm gonna need a little bit more clarification
[1365.98 --> 1371.96]  i don't think is right i'm 90 sure skins are banned in the main game
[1371.96 --> 1381.22]  oh it's like most of the fortnite content is all ages and some stuff is 12 plus where you can use
[1381.22 --> 1388.04]  the skins is that right i'm just gonna have to wait for ariel to clarify what the heck he's talking
[1388.04 --> 1394.24]  about he knows a lot about engineering stuff though he's he's really good at that stuff and he's really
[1394.24 --> 1401.20]  good at that hockey game that we play oh slap shot rebound no kidding yeah yeah yeah i don't know
[1401.20 --> 1404.24]  how he got that good that fast but he's very good at it
[1404.24 --> 1413.68]  ariel just says yes yes what an answer brother you're i'm trying to help you out here
[1413.68 --> 1415.54]  i'm trying to help you out
[1415.54 --> 1424.26]  oh no world class please clarify what is a children on staff i just mean he's really young
[1424.26 --> 1433.70]  the main game is all ages i think he says okay well yeah so but you can you can use skins in the main
[1433.70 --> 1442.24]  game so okay okay i think his point i think i get it i think i get it i think his point is that um
[1442.24 --> 1448.56]  these these like custom game modes very few of them are going to be 12 plus because most people
[1448.56 --> 1449.76]  would just be playing the main game
[1449.76 --> 1459.16]  yeah all right that makes sense well at any rate fortnite news let's move on because ultimately who
[1459.16 --> 1465.66]  really cares let's talk instead about whatever dan says we're supposed to do uh you got 25 minutes
[1465.66 --> 1469.44]  until we're doing merch messages and you're already on topic two which is supposed to start in three so
[1469.44 --> 1474.16]  third topic what about third you can have third topic what do you want to talk about luke should
[1474.16 --> 1482.10]  we do nothing adding blue bubble messaging on android yep pretty cool right all right this was
[1482.10 --> 1487.52]  reported by the verge and nine to five mac and basically everyone and their dog but nothing
[1487.52 --> 1493.72]  the phone company to be clear not nothing the absence of anything has announced nothing chats
[1493.72 --> 1500.86]  an app that will make a text from an android phone show up as an i message on iphone as well as
[1500.86 --> 1507.56]  enabling features like group chats typing indicators and voice notes the app exclusive to the nothing
[1507.56 --> 1513.78]  phone is a collaboration with sunbird which provides i message to android bridging services in beta
[1513.78 --> 1520.86]  when marquez brownlee asked if this operates similar to other bridging systems that route android
[1520.86 --> 1529.32]  messages through a mac server farm nothing confirmed that their solution is the same as that yes so what
[1529.32 --> 1537.94]  this means is that users have to give access to their icloud credentials to nothing or sunbird i guess
[1537.94 --> 1544.44]  probably sunbird directly however nothing says that sunbird stores them as a token in an encrypted
[1544.44 --> 1548.50]  database and deletes them after two weeks of inactivity
[1548.50 --> 1563.40]  okay realistically if implemented the way that they say it is luke probably fine probably fine uh
[1563.40 --> 1571.98]  probably fine enough i'll say not not fine entirely but i didn't know but the challenge here is you know
[1571.98 --> 1577.72]  the old saying as it goes trust but verify luke is there any way that anyone could verify this
[1577.72 --> 1585.68]  no i don't think so i mean unless you unless you basically try to break into it and fail
[1585.68 --> 1592.36]  oh okay okay that's not not a suggestion yeah really not legal advice
[1592.36 --> 1599.92]  it's not investment advice either it's nothing just you know it shows over shows over
[1599.92 --> 1606.60]  we're out of here see you later have a good weekend um
[1606.60 --> 1614.80]  damn it luke only two days later though apple announced that all of this may be completely
[1614.80 --> 1620.54]  unnecessary they are finally doing it okay can we speculate for a little bit here
[1620.54 --> 1627.56]  what do you think it was that made apple cave no i wanted to have more fun with it luke you did
[1627.56 --> 1633.68]  ah you ruined it i was gonna talk about honestly i thought i thought with the like 14 second delay
[1633.68 --> 1641.22]  that the lineup was gonna happen more oh well okay i was going to talk about some of the ways that
[1641.22 --> 1648.28]  certain other parties have tried to put pressure on apple to adopt rich communication i think the s
[1648.28 --> 1655.36]  is for service but rcs message or rich communication messaging standard whatever it is rcs um for
[1655.36 --> 1662.00]  example i remember one year at ces i think it was there were little like text messages from google to
[1662.00 --> 1668.54]  apple or something like that um asking you know why they used outdated sms still on the iphone
[1668.54 --> 1676.06]  i know google has put a ton of pressure on apple to adopt rcs i suspect although i don't know for sure
[1676.06 --> 1684.76]  that the uh the mobile carriers in the major markets have probably maybe not put pressure on apple but
[1684.76 --> 1693.90]  asked respectfully for them to adopt rcs because these legacy sms messaging or i shouldn't say messaging
[1693.90 --> 1699.82]  service because sms is short for short messaging service uh but this this legacy sms stuff sucks
[1699.82 --> 1708.38]  uh encryption is not supported group chats suck uh just about everything about sms kind of sucks and mms
[1708.38 --> 1716.10]  isn't much better um but it's been very obvious to anyone with two brain cells to run together to rub
[1716.10 --> 1725.58]  together to rub to you got there no i'm fine i'm good uh it's been obvious to anyone with a couple of
[1725.58 --> 1731.30]  brain cells to rub together that apple's main motivation for keeping i message and all of those
[1731.30 --> 1738.62]  extra nice things about messaging from an iphone to an iphone exclusive to the iphone has been all
[1738.62 --> 1745.64]  about keeping you locked into the ecosystem which i i don't think we have to rehash how perplexed all of
[1745.64 --> 1750.58]  that makes me uh i've i've never understood it the color of a bubble has never mattered to me
[1750.58 --> 1759.00]  um the the idea of being reliant on my my default sms app for something like a group message or
[1759.00 --> 1766.96]  sending more complex emojis or sharing media is just again it's utterly bewildering to me like i i i have
[1766.96 --> 1773.24]  over half a dozen messaging apps on my phone and that's that doesn't bother me um i i i don't know
[1773.24 --> 1778.86]  some people seem to really really struggle with it but i it doesn't bother me at all um
[1778.86 --> 1785.62]  but for some reason this has been a major consideration for people to not only stay on
[1785.62 --> 1793.00]  the iphone but buy iphones like in some cases for other members of their families um so anyway
[1793.00 --> 1798.72]  the last major party putting pressure on them yes was the european union thank you luke for spoiling
[1798.72 --> 1806.16]  the punchline no problem in other news that's actually kind of a bigger deal to me actually hold
[1806.16 --> 1812.62]  on first let's talk about the benefits of rcs um it can work over mobile data or wi-fi which is super
[1812.62 --> 1817.38]  cool it would allow for cross-platform use of i message style features and calling these i message
[1817.38 --> 1822.78]  features is ridiculous so i'm just going to call them messaging app features like read receipts
[1822.78 --> 1829.76]  typing indicators and higher quality images that's super cool um apple has previously criticized rcs as
[1829.76 --> 1837.04]  less secure than i message uh because it doesn't include end-to-end encryption um iphone rcs messages
[1837.04 --> 1841.22]  might also route through google servers because of google's deal with phone carriers okay that's
[1841.22 --> 1846.72]  interesting which means that there is a solid possibility nay probability that android bubbles
[1846.72 --> 1855.52]  would remain green uh so this is not exactly you know the kumbaya you know everything is completely
[1855.52 --> 1860.52]  interoperable moment that some people might be hoping that it is but at the very least you're
[1860.52 --> 1866.70]  not going to be stuck using 1998 technology when you're texting to your friend on an iphone could
[1866.70 --> 1872.28]  that mean it says iphone rcs messages might route through google service could that mean that
[1872.28 --> 1877.96]  some if not all iphone bubbles could be green
[1877.96 --> 1885.50]  no because if if are you sure because if if they're getting around it by sending them
[1885.52 --> 1891.74]  through apple servers to make them blue this is literally just the inverse no no no no okay so
[1891.74 --> 1897.58]  so the reason it would be is because it's not coming straight apple to apple across only their
[1897.58 --> 1902.40]  own infrastructure as soon as it goes out to someone else's infrastructure my understanding
[1902.40 --> 1907.68]  is it wouldn't be blue probably um like for example when you're messaging from one iphone to another
[1907.68 --> 1914.32]  and this came up a lot more years ago like back when i had my iphone 4 occasionally i would be
[1914.32 --> 1919.32]  messaging to another iphone user and the bubble would be green and that would be because it was
[1919.32 --> 1927.70]  sent as an sms so if i didn't have data reception but i did have cellular reception you could still
[1927.70 --> 1933.52]  send a message uh but it would it would show up as a as a green bubble so i don't know if they like
[1933.52 --> 1941.18]  patched that or if it's just way less likely these days to be in range of cellular but out of range of
[1941.18 --> 1946.84]  data like i i i think that's probably i i don't remember the last time i had solid cellular reception
[1946.84 --> 1953.02]  such that i could send messages and make calls but i had no data connection um but i've definitely seen
[1953.02 --> 1963.18]  that before um anyway the bigger news in my mind is that apple and as part of this same push from the eu
[1963.18 --> 1970.40]  is required to allow sideloading by next year and according to leaks financial filings from apple
[1970.40 --> 1978.18]  as well as code found in ios 17.2 beta apple is preparing to allow sideloading on iphones
[1978.18 --> 1984.24]  well before that deadline happens though they are still appealing i message and the app store's
[1984.24 --> 1991.16]  designations as gatekeeper platforms man sideloading on the iphone are you ready to go iphone luke i mean
[1991.16 --> 1997.38]  you just you just bought an android phone like a pleb don't you feel like an idiot now well i felt
[1997.38 --> 2002.32]  like an idiot for a while after i first got it because i didn't really like the phone um and now
[2002.32 --> 2010.32]  honestly every single time i pick up my 4a 5g i'm like wow yep i wish it was this still um so i i don't
[2010.32 --> 2018.00]  know how i feel about my phone right now even but um honestly the thing that kept me from going iphone was
[2018.00 --> 2026.88]  more there there was cost and just the annoyance of learning a new thing because like i need my
[2026.88 --> 2033.36]  phone to do so little these days that i just don't really care um but i'm not i'm not completely against
[2033.36 --> 2038.28]  switching i it was fairly close i was looking into iphones and i could see myself on an iphone
[2038.28 --> 2045.48]  in the future there's really very little keeping me on on android these days um so yeah i don't know
[2045.48 --> 2048.80]  maybe we'll see we'll see how many more buttons the eu pushes
[2048.80 --> 2056.02]  so i think it's time to talk about my ai pin
[2056.02 --> 2064.10]  oh what i ordered one is it is this in the doc or you just chatting no i'm just chatting
[2064.10 --> 2069.72]  i'm like a twitch stream right now i'm in a hot tub do you need me to change the title on twitch
[2069.72 --> 2073.58]  i'm in a hot tub chatting no no you don't need to change the title on twitch dan thank you very
[2073.58 --> 2080.02]  much that's very helpful um you know when does it arrive i don't know i mean does it matter
[2080.02 --> 2090.80]  stupid yeah i spent 700 on this are you kidding me yeah familiar gestures
[2090.80 --> 2101.66]  like what so hold on a second do i need two whole hands to touch this thing and also project onto my
[2101.66 --> 2110.70]  hand are you kidding me uh well you don't always have to project what is he no no no you don't always
[2110.70 --> 2116.34]  have to project no i know you don't you can just talk to it and it can just you know what's the best
[2116.34 --> 2124.26]  finish for paint eggshell you idiot like i i don't know is that really how much is a vintage
[2124.26 --> 2132.46]  oh man this is cringe dude i haven't even looked at their marketing for this thing
[2132.46 --> 2142.60]  i'm so excited for you to check it out i love that this baby is not immediately grabbing this and
[2142.60 --> 2147.48]  ripping it off her shirt because anyone who's ever had a baby knows that that's the first thing it
[2147.48 --> 2154.14]  would do and i believe it would go flying uh because i think it's just magnetically held on
[2154.14 --> 2160.36]  right the battery goes on the inside i think nice so the battery would then like fall down inside of
[2160.36 --> 2164.74]  your shirt and the front of it would go flying wait hold on no no hold on a second luke
[2164.74 --> 2179.66]  oh okay no i think i get it so what my uber eats order arrives and then instead of getting the
[2179.66 --> 2188.66]  notification on my phone or on my smartwatch i project it to my hand yeah yeah yeah brilliant
[2188.66 --> 2197.56]  that was it that was the light bulb moment for me i get it aren't you gonna have to like move your
[2197.56 --> 2202.48]  hand around out in front of you to like find where it's projecting as well you're just gonna kind of
[2202.48 --> 2209.18]  be standing there waving your hand around they invented the smartwatch but you're gonna put it
[2209.18 --> 2220.78]  i'm just gonna read my text it's blurry oh so uh you know it used to be that we had smartwatches
[2220.78 --> 2225.06]  right like your apple watch or your pixel watch or whatever else and then we had dumb watches which
[2225.06 --> 2229.46]  were ones that didn't have connectivity and they just had a traditional movement but i think what
[2229.46 --> 2235.78]  we're gonna have to do is change these classifications right you're gonna have your smartwatch right with
[2235.78 --> 2240.52]  your wi-fi connection and it's on your wrist and everything you're gonna have your traditional
[2240.52 --> 2246.24]  watch or your mechanical your movement watch okay and then you're gonna have your dumb watch which is
[2246.24 --> 2249.78]  basically like this fucking thing
[2249.78 --> 2259.58]  you gotta you gotta you gotta hold off until you actually have it you gotta hold off a little bit
[2259.58 --> 2265.90]  he's just he's just frustrated because now he's actually spent money on it i know i didn't care
[2265.90 --> 2271.30]  it could just be stupid all at once over in its stupid little corner before i had to spend money on
[2271.30 --> 2277.98]  it yeah yeah i could i can tell it's it's a little bit harder with delay and not being able to you know
[2277.98 --> 2283.22]  judge body language all that much but this is this is financial pain um because now he's frustrated
[2283.22 --> 2288.50]  with the purchase and look guys look look look look look look i've seen a lot of mischaracterizations
[2288.50 --> 2293.76]  about my relationship with money over the last couple of months um there's been a lot of
[2293.76 --> 2302.00]  misunderstanding i have no problem spending money i will spend money in a way that is wise and
[2302.00 --> 2308.58]  justifiable day after day week after week year after year you bring me a good business case for why
[2308.58 --> 2315.08]  we should spend some money let's spend some money let's go no problem we reinvest in this business
[2315.08 --> 2324.62]  hard look at the lab i don't like wasting money yeah this it's not a waste it's for a video it's
[2324.62 --> 2332.02]  content actual it's content no but i'm not the only one buying it i'm gonna make a video sure i'm gonna
[2332.02 --> 2340.20]  get a return on my investment but someone else is gonna buy this they're gonna buy garbage okay
[2340.20 --> 2349.12]  why don't we just list garbage buy my garbage.com does that exist potentially i'm gonna raise i'm
[2349.12 --> 2357.00]  gonna have a billion dollar valuation but buy my actual garbage.com isn't that what sweden does
[2357.00 --> 2361.78]  then they incinerate it and that's how they generate power oh it redirects to ebay maybe they're
[2361.78 --> 2364.76]  i'm kidding i thought you're gonna say ikea
[2364.76 --> 2372.26]  no no it's available it's a premium domain buy my garbage.com
[2372.26 --> 2379.96]  that's actually really funny um okay so yeah there's there's two there's two paths forward
[2379.96 --> 2387.88]  either it's somehow amazing and then people buy it amazing or sure maybe more likely whatever
[2387.88 --> 2394.50]  it's trash and then you would you would help to stop future purchases right isn't that the whole
[2394.50 --> 2399.64]  point isn't that the whole point i love that to start my buy my garbage.com
[2399.64 --> 2402.98]  e-tail site i would have to buy their garbage domain
[2402.98 --> 2414.48]  look i'm sorry you invested in this but nobody's buying that for like 12 000 us dollars it's not
[2414.48 --> 2423.62]  happening oh no oh i'm sorry oh oh we should have started on this topic i got i'm i'm i'm feeling
[2423.62 --> 2429.82]  good i haven't laughed that hard in a while by the way you should do an i switched with it you should
[2429.82 --> 2440.00]  use it for 30 days i will not i've suffered enough luke oh make it make vance use it for a month
[2440.00 --> 2444.90]  no i would never that's cruel and unusual punishment what did vance do wrong well can't you have both of
[2444.90 --> 2450.44]  them no i mean he would torture it by interacting with it in front of you i will i will use it as an
[2450.44 --> 2456.84]  accessory it'll be it'll be an accessory to my otherwise properly functional phone is it not an
[2456.84 --> 2464.34]  accessory i will use it look hey hey look look look look look here's all my notes on the lg
[2464.34 --> 2470.58]  wing it out the window uh yeah but you had you had to use that you moved your sim over didn't you
[2470.58 --> 2478.74]  i did yeah how is google docs so useless when we did like the linux challenge he just didn't use his
[2478.74 --> 2479.16]  computer
[2479.16 --> 2492.18]  see i got good notes i got notes on the wing those are all point form i've got a few little
[2492.18 --> 2498.56]  videos i took of it just like glitching the crap out in terms of the i have this one that i recorded
[2498.56 --> 2503.20]  just like on my because i have to carry two phones in case i actually need to get anything done and the
[2503.20 --> 2507.62]  wing just isn't working but i've got this great one where i took a video of the wing in my hand
[2507.62 --> 2512.52]  where i can pull down the notification shade but absolutely everything else fails to register
[2512.52 --> 2519.42]  anything it's freaking awesome you should totally buy a phone from a company that exited the phone
[2519.42 --> 2526.88]  market years ago strong recommend let's go yeah that's a little rough
[2526.88 --> 2533.12]  next topic are we doing merch messages yet i feel like we're overdue yeah hit me dan
[2533.12 --> 2542.40]  okay let's see what do we got hello dll with the new steam deck oled out do you think it's better to
[2542.40 --> 2548.84]  buy a used lcd model or to spend the extra money on the oled i don't already own one
[2548.84 --> 2557.48]  oh man it's so personal so hold on let's first first things first you know i don't want to i don't
[2557.48 --> 2564.86]  want to speculate here let's see what steam deck non oleds are going for here okay here's a 512 for
[2564.86 --> 2570.08]  400 bucks i'm going to ignore shipping because that's because they're shipping to canada i will
[2570.08 --> 2577.06]  assume you're probably american given that about 40 of our audiences what's that now it says adult
[2577.06 --> 2585.08]  owned in the listing for that top one oh wow okay adult owned um all right i don't know if that's good
[2585.08 --> 2591.28]  i don't like i don't like pretty careless adults so i don't that makes yeah i'm not sure that that's
[2591.28 --> 2596.64]  a positive i i'm a little i know it would drop themselves down the stairs let alone a steam deck
[2596.64 --> 2604.34]  doesn't have a web browser too steam deck one terabyte ssd is that just the ssd oh no this is an
[2604.34 --> 2612.40]  auction okay there's an auction i'm gonna change it to uh buy it now only hello buddy can oh okay did i
[2612.40 --> 2621.36]  open that in a new tab uh oh wow the limited edition this guy wants 1200 bucks what okay i'm
[2621.36 --> 2629.90]  gonna change it to buy it now only buy it now here we go let's shop okay 64 gig upgraded to 512 i would
[2629.90 --> 2638.56]  take that over the 512 for sure 320 bucks for 256 given how cheap ssds are i don't mind this deal
[2638.56 --> 2644.18]  either if you can get like you know 10 bucks or 15 bucks for your 256 gig ssd on facebook marketplace
[2644.18 --> 2652.98]  you throw that into a like a one terabyte ssd put that in there 300 bucks hey not bad from canada nice
[2652.98 --> 2659.60]  at that price maybe it's kid owned boy is that ever appealing because see here's the thing right guys
[2659.60 --> 2667.70]  is the new steam deck is not um is not shipping at every price point
[2667.70 --> 2677.82]  so if we go to if we go to valve site here if you're buying something for 300 oh man how do i get to the
[2677.82 --> 2687.40]  u.s pricing dang it valve makes this really difficult oh no yeah just language i don't get to pick a
[2687.40 --> 2693.64]  different region so i forget what the stupid u.s pricing is because i can't access it
[2693.64 --> 2702.34]  usd oh hey yeah here it is here we go here we go here we go okay so the steam oled is available
[2702.34 --> 2711.86]  at 512 gigs for 549 so the entry level one right the the 400 one is still the old lcd version
[2711.86 --> 2719.84]  so we are talking about a difference of you know if it's 300 bucks for a used last gen steam deck
[2719.84 --> 2724.90]  there's not going to be any used oleds and if there are they're probably going to be selling at an
[2724.90 --> 2730.34]  elevated price as opposed to a discounted price so we could be talking nearly double the amount
[2730.34 --> 2737.96]  for the upgraded screen the uh upgraded haptics i mean the upgraded basically everything the better
[2737.96 --> 2743.28]  power better battery life oh man better battery life that is a big deal if you're planning to play
[2743.28 --> 2749.20]  you know mostly within range of an outlet i would say yeah there's a strong argument to be made for
[2749.20 --> 2753.16]  the older one actually in any case there's a strong argument to be made for the older one but if you
[2753.16 --> 2758.82]  are going to be often away from the wall where you are not going to be able to easily plug in and
[2758.82 --> 2764.34]  battery life matters a lot to you i think it's worth the extra even ignoring the awesome new screen
[2764.34 --> 2769.40]  oh man it's so good it's absolutely incredible
[2769.40 --> 2777.84]  yeah and like the the oled immediately sold out right so like i don't think you're gonna be able
[2777.84 --> 2785.88]  to get it easily for a long time anyways oh yeah i wonder what the lead times are like do they even
[2785.88 --> 2791.40]  provide an estimate oh yeah no hold on a second look at this estimated delivery
[2791.40 --> 2800.68]  three to five business days boys i'm i guess they were ready this time they've probably been
[2800.68 --> 2806.02]  producing these for weeks or months getting stock together so that they could have a launch that's
[2806.02 --> 2812.92]  not just a cluster of scalping my friend must be confused then he's like i can't believe i missed
[2812.92 --> 2817.98]  it i tried to buy it i couldn't get it oh they might be talking about the limited edition clear one
[2817.98 --> 2824.30]  uh that's definitely what they're talking about yeah because those i thought the one terabyte oled
[2824.30 --> 2832.40]  and that were the same those are getting scalped hard how limited edition is that very is like is it
[2832.40 --> 2840.28]  completely gone oh yeah i think jake got one okay nice yeah super cool it's limited enough that they
[2840.28 --> 2846.68]  weren't even willing to send out any samples of them even if we returned it they were like no we we
[2846.68 --> 2851.56]  really don't have a lot of these so yeah people are people are wanting like a few hundred bucks
[2851.56 --> 2857.64]  uplift for these things um and i think people are going to go for it especially knowing that valve's
[2857.64 --> 2863.48]  probably not going to do a like a steam deck 2 like a big hardware refresh probably another year or two at least
[2863.48 --> 2865.08]  yeah
[2865.08 --> 2875.18]  oh limited edition is still one to two weeks shipping i didn't see it
[2876.68 --> 2882.60]  let's have a look here steam deck limited edition let's see if uh if it's available
[2882.60 --> 2887.72]  limited edit no way estimated delivery one to two weeks you can still get them
[2887.72 --> 2891.48]  okay well wow what makes people think they're going to be able to scalp this thing
[2891.48 --> 2895.08]  is it still available in the u.s maybe this is just a canadian thing
[2895.08 --> 2904.20]  oh it's on its own page oh no buy my actual garbage.com goes to ltdstore.com now apparently
[2904.20 --> 2912.60]  hell yeah let's go terrible gotta be careful with calling about it because people could redirect it
[2912.60 --> 2917.88]  oh yeah yeah guys no guarantee it'll still go there at any point or that there isn't any kind of bad
[2917.88 --> 2923.72]  things happening with it or anything like that um yeah oh it's because people want it outside of
[2923.72 --> 2929.88]  the us and canada that's why and valve hasn't made it available in many parts of the world yet so
[2929.88 --> 2935.88]  that's what these ebay sellers are counting on okay that makes sense i wonder how many to let me buy then
[2936.60 --> 2944.36]  kidding kidding kidding everybody relax luke i'm pretty sure i could feel your butthole clench from here
[2944.36 --> 2950.60]  across an ocean linus why did the stream go down there's men outside
[2954.04 --> 2960.92]  you know what's kind of crazy yeah it won't let me do it at all because i'm in japan right now um
[2961.56 --> 2969.48]  i i even tried to buy it like through my desktop application of steam but it redirects me to i understand
[2969.48 --> 2974.28]  the desktop application is just loading web pages um but it redirects me to like a browser
[2975.00 --> 2981.48]  external browser web page if i wanted to try to get that one um and i i can't it it like forgets that
[2982.12 --> 2982.76]  i'm uh
[2984.84 --> 2987.24]  yes rick it does account and it won't let me buy it
[2989.88 --> 2996.36]  that's wild all right man now i'm tempted should i get one wait did you try to buy one
[2996.36 --> 3003.64]  i was i was seeing what would happen on this end but no i i didn't try to buy oh okay okay i thought
[3003.64 --> 3007.32]  you were i thought you were finally ready finally ready for a steam deck because i thought we had
[3007.32 --> 3011.16]  talked about it and you said you still weren't going to go for it it would be pretty it would have been
[3011.16 --> 3019.00]  pretty nice on the plane man it would have but you know what i did played final fantasy 6 on your laptop

[3124.12 --> 3134.60]  week starting of course with our sexy fruit underwear kind of old news now but inspired by the hack back
[3134.60 --> 3141.80]  in march we have launched that's right my friends strawberry underwear ah they're so cute
[3141.80 --> 3151.80]  uh um we also to complete the collection launched our oh this is still strawberry what is he holding
[3152.92 --> 3156.36]  okay sure it's a weight it's not a hanging dangling
[3158.04 --> 3163.64]  gray ball um we also launched to accompany our strawberry underwear eggplant
[3163.64 --> 3172.92]  which is not about making you feel inadequate it's just a color and peach this is great this great
[3172.92 --> 3180.04]  shot of jamie that's funny we both went for the coffee cup with the peach um hey look at that i found
[3180.04 --> 3190.28]  uh i found that fortnite character's cake hey there it is there it is good find um yeah they they look and
[3190.28 --> 3197.16]  feel exactly as good as our underwear does which guys i i don't write the reviews they're really
[3197.16 --> 3204.52]  really well reviewed um and get this it gets even better they are available in his and her styles
[3205.40 --> 3210.52]  so you can get the scoop bralette and the boy shorts uh oh wait where are the boy shorts oh yeah here they
[3210.52 --> 3215.88]  are so these are available in oh i think it's just strawberry for the women's so you can get a his and
[3215.88 --> 3223.56]  hers matching set of the uh the strawberry uh underwear pretty cool so we've got the bikini bottoms and
[3224.28 --> 3229.72]  triangle top and then we've also got the uh scoop top and then the boy shorts bottoms
[3234.28 --> 3243.80]  hey yo sick love it uh oh and there's more uh we launched our new rgb rokin t-shirt
[3246.60 --> 3252.52]  the story here is a little bit long but i'll try to keep it short um this special deal for this
[3252.52 --> 3259.08]  shirt was the result of an error in production where our factory made a mistake with the uh with
[3259.08 --> 3264.76]  the material request so rather than letting it all go to waste we decided to turn it into an opportunity
[3264.76 --> 3271.08]  for our amazing customers to get a really good shirt for a really good price even if it's not exactly what
[3271.08 --> 3278.60]  it was supposed to be honestly if we were launching the rgb shirt today i would probably have no issue
[3278.60 --> 3285.24]  launching it like this but it isn't quite as comfortable as the as the white one that we have
[3285.24 --> 3291.40]  and so knowing that and knowing that people were probably already going to own that one in some cases
[3291.40 --> 3296.36]  and then go and order this one because they like it so much i was worried that people would get the new
[3296.36 --> 3304.12]  one realize it wasn't quite as perfectly soft and amazing to wear and then be upset because you can
[3304.12 --> 3311.40]  see this is one of our best reviewed garments on the site it's a five star garment uh so this new one
[3311.40 --> 3317.24]  is pretty much the same dealio where it's got the these little uh these little flecks uh these little
[3317.24 --> 3323.16]  neps in it but the difference is that it is on a blue base color and what happened was the supplier
[3323.16 --> 3329.56]  made the executive decision to change the material in order to achieve our color objectives a little bit
[3329.56 --> 3335.48]  better but they didn't ask us and we would have said no don't do that we are we would rather have the
[3335.48 --> 3343.40]  feel be exactly the same so it doesn't really show up much in the in the uh in these pictures so it's
[3343.40 --> 3349.64]  like it's kind of hard to see in person it is very noticeable that there's kind of a cool little sort of
[3349.64 --> 3354.04]  starry night we call it rgb i don't know whatever you want to call it there's a there's a very cool little
[3354.04 --> 3365.40]  effect um also holy smokes new rgb knit sweater oh right so the the rgb rokin shirt is only
[3365.40 --> 3373.24]  ten dollars that is oh if i do say so myself an absolutely killer deal for a shirt that is almost
[3373.80 --> 3381.08]  that other five star one but in blue and ever so slightly different man we have a ton of stuff on
[3381.08 --> 3385.48]  the store right now okay i promise i will get through this as fast as i can uh we also have a
[3385.48 --> 3391.88]  sweater in a similar style but obviously it's a sweater so it's quite a bit heavier it's meant for your
[3392.84 --> 3399.24]  sweating comfort there we go there you go you can see kind of what it looks like kind of get an idea
[3399.24 --> 3405.16]  of the texture that one's 39.99 perfect for christmas parties or just generally wearing when you want to
[3405.16 --> 3414.92]  look you know kind of nice and you know presentable um and finally oh wow look at this hey we made a
[3414.92 --> 3423.48]  christmas ornament that's cool uh what's the deal with the christmas ornament is it in the bonus bin
[3424.04 --> 3429.64]  i guess it's probably in the bonus bin yeah i think you can you can also buy it if you really want
[3429.64 --> 3436.60]  probably but uh place any order and you can get one of these in the bonus look it's a little gpu and
[3436.60 --> 3443.80]  you can hang it from your tree oh what is he doing what is who is he talking to room service oh oh oh my
[3443.80 --> 3450.04]  goodness what what is happening right now um okay and i promise this is the last thing
[3450.04 --> 3456.44]  we have our sign up form for our black friday cyber monday email list we already have thousands
[3456.44 --> 3462.28]  and thousands of signups um but there's still time so if you want the best chance of taking advantage
[3462.28 --> 3466.92]  of our daily deals while they're here make sure you register it's ltdstore.com pages
[3466.92 --> 3474.20]  bfcm we are not going to spam you you are not joining our newsletter mailing list even if at some
[3474.20 --> 3478.68]  point you should probably do that because we're going to have a bunch of really good newsletters at some
[3478.68 --> 3485.80]  point once we get into like a a firmer release cadence for them uh you will just get these deals
[3485.80 --> 3491.72]  and it will be awesome and i think you will probably like it okay there dan i explained what
[3491.72 --> 3497.08]  merch messages are are you happy you asked now yes that's my job to make you do that okay next
[3497.08 --> 3505.40]  merch message i recently got hired at light structures that's not really a question okay i'll just uh i'll just
[3505.40 --> 3510.20]  rewrite this um i was wondering if you guys ever heard about optical payables being used this way
[3511.00 --> 3516.76]  it doesn't make sense without context does it minus they monitor wait optical sensors
[3517.40 --> 3526.04]  to monitor the whole stress on ships what so what that like if it flexes a little bit you would be able
[3526.04 --> 3531.80]  to the light frequency would change because it moves slightly right so the wavelengths would be
[3531.80 --> 3541.00]  different yeah that's very cool makes sense wow that's super cool no i've never seen that before
[3541.00 --> 3547.56]  fiber optic hull stress monitoring system hull fib it gives a warning when stress and bending moment
[3547.56 --> 3552.52]  levels and acceleration of ship motion approach levels which require corrective action such as escaping the
[3552.52 --> 3559.88]  area reducing the speed or changing the heading of the vessel super cool no never heard of that before
[3559.88 --> 3566.20]  but i love it um dan want to give me one more yeah sure um linus would you ever consider writing a book
[3566.20 --> 3575.64]  about ltt uh after you have retired yeah i've already started it sort of but i am not nearly on the ball
[3575.64 --> 3583.96]  enough to keep up with my notes so it would likely be less about ltt and more just some general ramblings
[3583.96 --> 3588.68]  that i throw at a page and if anyone buys it then great because realistically i'm not going anywhere
[3588.68 --> 3597.00]  until i've um until i'm in a position where i just don't need any more money anymore anyway um which
[3597.00 --> 3602.76]  even though i would be fine today i'm not quite there yet because i have a badminton center and a lab to
[3602.76 --> 3609.80]  pay for so i'm still i'm still highly motivated um to to to crush it over here but
[3612.04 --> 3616.84]  yeah at that point i feel like i would the only reason i would write something is just because
[3616.84 --> 3621.00]  i felt like it and i wouldn't want to write something because i had to sell a bunch of
[3621.00 --> 3624.12]  copies i think i feel like that would i feel like that would kind of ruin it
[3626.36 --> 3628.12]  don't worry i'd only write good things about you luke
[3628.12 --> 3634.68]  i don't know about you dan i wouldn't expect nice things i don't think that's true
[3637.40 --> 3638.60]  i would write nice things about dan
[3639.88 --> 3644.52]  don't patronize me you two because because because if i didn't i'm pretty sure the audience
[3644.52 --> 3647.40]  would lynch me no it would be lawsuits i'm pretty sure they
[3647.40 --> 3652.92]  i did way worse things than he said
[3658.12 --> 3663.48]  gotta love that trans-pacific delay right there that's that's not his brain leg that's uh that's
[3663.48 --> 3668.68]  that's fiber optic cable leg his his his hull is uh on the verge of breaking
[3668.68 --> 3678.76]  all right additional topic yeah what do you want to talk about next luke uh tesla bans reselling
[3678.76 --> 3686.76]  cyber trucks how about that one it's pretty juicy uh it's juicy sure i i think it's funny um and
[3686.76 --> 3691.72]  really dumb but yeah tesla has added a clause to its motor vehicle order agreements that prohibits
[3691.72 --> 3697.64]  cyber truck buyers from selling the vehicle within a year of its delivery date tesla may otherwise seek
[3697.64 --> 3704.92]  uh injunctive relief to prevent the transfer of title of the vehicle or demand liquidated damages
[3704.92 --> 3711.16]  from the end user in the amount of fifty thousand dollars or the value received as consideration for
[3711.16 --> 3718.12]  the sale or transfer whichever is greater wow uh the new policy also says that tesla may unilaterally
[3718.12 --> 3723.96]  cancel orders they believe were made for the purpose of reselling which is funny because i know people
[3723.96 --> 3730.92]  i know people now that have pre-orders on the cyber truck that are entirely planning on reselling
[3730.92 --> 3735.72]  it and we're planning on reselling it from the beginning so that will be interesting uh buyers who run
[3735.72 --> 3741.32]  into unforeseen circumstances and must sell the vehicle have the option of selling it back to tesla
[3741.32 --> 3748.76]  discounted by 25 cents for every mile driven that actually seems maybe really not bad at all
[3748.76 --> 3755.72]  yeah if tesla agrees that the reason is valid okay so they also declined to buy the vehicle
[3755.72 --> 3762.20]  and provide the buyer written permission to sell it to a third party so our discussion question here is
[3762.84 --> 3770.04]  is this a reasonable manner to curb scalping on a product where that's obviously a concern i also
[3770.04 --> 3781.64]  i mean look luke how many friends do you think i have in the world one i mean that okay uh you're you're not
[3784.68 --> 3785.88]  you're not that unique
[3787.96 --> 3791.64]  oh you probably meant yvonne oh that hurts ouch
[3791.64 --> 3803.24]  my point is i don't have a lot of friends i was even going after myself and he had he had to twist
[3803.24 --> 3811.72]  um i know people who have cyber truck pre-orders and it's for the express purpose of reselling them
[3811.72 --> 3817.24]  um so with that in mind knowing that this is this is a product that people intend to resell and
[3817.24 --> 3826.04]  that like kind of the market for and the perceived value of um is is this actually kind of reasonable
[3827.96 --> 3833.80]  handyman's posting that they might have already removed the clause um i i don't know i i like the
[3833.80 --> 3842.84]  idea of hurting the scalping market scalping in modern years has been actually ridiculous um like
[3842.84 --> 3851.80]  scalping combined with uh user level extreme sales on the internet um has been a very very negative
[3851.80 --> 3859.24]  reality for uh markets in general but i think any company coming in and telling you what you can and
[3859.24 --> 3863.96]  cannot do with something after you purchase it is something that i'm always going to push back against
[3863.96 --> 3870.28]  it's something that happens all the time yep uh this is not this is not a unique scenario uh but i i i
[3870.28 --> 3875.24]  don't think i can agree with it pretty much ever so it is what it is yep i think that summarizes how
[3875.24 --> 3879.88]  i felt about it and probably how a lot of people felt about it based on that this article from road
[3879.88 --> 3887.80]  and track.com says that as of yesterday it looks like is that a six or a five two days ago wow that is
[3887.80 --> 3896.84]  the worst font ever uh through through the stream i can't see that tiny one pixel gap here but it's it's a five
[3896.84 --> 3906.76]  um since two days ago um effective two days ago tesla has apparently removed the anti-flipping clause so
[3906.76 --> 3914.76]  feel free to flip your cyber truck to your heart's content sounds good i don't actually have an order in
[3914.76 --> 3922.84]  for one but i do i wish i did no not really i don't think i need that hassle the the at least in canada
[3922.84 --> 3928.36]  anyway the the tax burden of buying a vehicle and flipping it is a big part of the reason we didn't
[3928.36 --> 3933.32]  end up doing that whole concept that i laid out where i was just going to buy cars to review and
[3933.32 --> 3938.52]  then the only cost to me would have been whatever i eat on the you know few kilometers i drive on it
[3938.52 --> 3942.20]  when we resell the thing hopefully to someone in the audience after the review or something like
[3942.20 --> 3948.12]  that like i had this whole thing kind of worked out in my head but the tax man the tax man wants a piece
[3948.12 --> 3956.04]  every time yep and that was gonna just kill kill the cost of it would have been brutal
[3957.56 --> 3965.08]  all right oh small update on ariana's zappy power supplies uh many commenters were concerned that we
[3965.08 --> 3971.40]  didn't address the potential electrical hazard of that sign power supply for the the the bunny
[3972.04 --> 3977.88]  um faux neon sign that ariana had in her tech upgrade um
[3978.52 --> 3983.00]  and they were worried that the bunnies would get electrocuted or something like that but rest
[3983.00 --> 3988.44]  assured this was addressed well before we posted the video not everything for these tech upgrades
[3988.44 --> 3994.20]  happens on the day of the shoot we shoot them in one day but sometimes prep happens sometimes post
[3994.20 --> 3999.32]  cleanup happens and we we do our best to make sure the bulk of it happens on the day of the shoot so you
[3999.32 --> 4002.28]  guys get to be along for the ride but not always every little thing
[4002.28 --> 4011.16]  yeah what what do you know what was done because some people in chat are saying it was one piece of
[4011.16 --> 4016.12]  masking tape no i don't remember in the video yeah we just put a temporary measure i think it was just
[4016.12 --> 4021.08]  a piece of tape but no yeah something additional yeah they probably 3d printed something or something i
[4021.08 --> 4025.40]  i don't know exactly what they did but someone someone's someone clever and responsible did
[4025.40 --> 4029.80]  something presumably i i didn't ask for the details it wasn't elijah don't worry
[4034.28 --> 4034.68]  rob
[4037.64 --> 4038.92]  uh do you want to pick a topic
[4040.60 --> 4040.92]  do you want
[4043.40 --> 4047.64]  don't you go ahead you go ahead i was going to suggest one but i i offered i offered to let you
[4047.64 --> 4057.56]  use pick one first uh amazon to sell cars sure amazon amazon has announced oh the delay the delay
[4057.56 --> 4065.32]  oh no uh i'll go okay i'll go i'll go amazon has announced a partnership oh okay okay i did that on
[4065.32 --> 4065.64]  purpose
[4070.60 --> 4075.64]  who goes now i don't know what to do you do it okay
[4077.64 --> 4086.76]  amazon amazon has announced a partnership with hyundai where alexa will be available through
[4086.76 --> 4093.40]  hyundai infotainment system starting in 2025 and hyundai dealerships will be able to sell vehicles
[4093.40 --> 4101.16]  on amazon buyers will then have the option to have the car picked up from the dealership or delivered
[4101.16 --> 4108.84]  to them most surveys show that consumers dislike car shopping particularly the dealership experience
[4108.84 --> 4116.52]  but 48 states limit direct to consumer sales of vehicles because yes my friends that's how powerful
[4116.52 --> 4123.16]  lobbying is isn't that great tesla has popularized the idea of direct to consumer sales but it has also
[4123.16 --> 4128.44]  faced lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions attempting to bar it from selling cars
[4128.44 --> 4135.08]  uh most dealers do already sell cars through their own websites but at least here i i don't have a
[4135.08 --> 4141.80]  lot of experience with this in americaland but here um getting it delivered is a bit of a hassle
[4141.80 --> 4148.12]  like there's red tape to to jump through and it's it's not a seamless experience like you would expect
[4148.76 --> 4153.48]  ordering something on amazon to be i mean is this the kind of thing we have to test out luke
[4153.48 --> 4158.44]  should i buy a hyundai in america just so that i can have it delivered to me like i don't
[4159.96 --> 4164.92]  i don't think so because there's there's been other buy a car over the internet services before
[4164.92 --> 4174.12]  so like i'm sure amazon can do it um yeah people are talking about carvana yeah i've never heard of that
[4174.12 --> 4180.60]  like really yeah i mean i don't know man how how often do you think i buy a car i i don't know
[4180.60 --> 4185.96]  oh is no they're not uh yeah but they're not gone
[4189.48 --> 4198.68]  carvana i'm pretty sure carvana is dead no public company still around yeah revenue of 13.6 billion
[4198.68 --> 4208.28]  as of uh 2022 they went public in 2017 i thought i heard it went bad maybe their stock just crashed
[4208.28 --> 4209.72]  super hard maybe that was it
[4210.60 --> 4220.76]  hmm interesting carvana stock yeah someone's saying um carvana is used cars okay
[4220.76 --> 4224.60]  google carvana stock and then look at the five-year chart
[4226.52 --> 4227.96]  what a ride let's go
[4227.96 --> 4244.28]  okay that's pretty rough uh wow sorry to all the bag holders who bought at 360 us dollars a share
[4244.28 --> 4253.88]  uh wow wow they dipped to seven dollars recovered to 47
[4254.44 --> 4260.12]  it's uh lower than that actually really um oh wow no yeah there it is four bucks
[4261.32 --> 4263.24]  yeah 405 is the lowest i've seen
[4265.16 --> 4271.08]  that's rough was the fastest growing car dealer in the united states known for its multi-story glass tower
[4271.08 --> 4277.08]  car vending machines got it got it got it got it got it so they this this is this is a pandemic boom
[4277.08 --> 4281.24]  thing then looking at the timing here yep that makes sense all right cool
[4281.24 --> 4289.16]  yeah the the used car market is uh is looking a little a little rougher there's a there's a lot of
[4289.16 --> 4291.56]  there's a man a ton of sectors that just
[4292.44 --> 4296.44]  swamp shot up during the the covet lockdowns and then just
[4297.40 --> 4302.36]  are having a really hard time since then i mean the pc industry has been struggling um
[4302.36 --> 4308.76]  um oh yeah yeah don't don't ask how i know but uh apparently sales of computers are
[4309.96 --> 4316.04]  struggling a lot like down double digit percent year over year over year since uh since the peak in
[4316.04 --> 4325.24]  like 2020 2021 all right the one i wanted to talk about was the playstation portal ah
[4325.24 --> 4333.88]  we shot what okay oh i've just seen stuff online that looks rough i haven't i haven't actually used
[4333.88 --> 4342.36]  it you know what i would love to hear what you have gathered about it based on community sentiment
[4342.36 --> 4349.32]  and then i would like to share my own experience having used it and worked on a review for it which
[4349.32 --> 4355.00]  will be coming out probably in the next few days cool so as i say this i've heard genuinely nothing
[4355.00 --> 4359.72]  from linus or anyone else at linus media group all i've seen is just some random stuff on the
[4359.72 --> 4364.20]  internet from other users and what i've gathered just looking at the tops of people's heads so he
[4364.20 --> 4374.52]  doesn't know anything pretty much to be honest um but yeah i what i've seen so far is laggy mess
[4374.52 --> 4382.28]  basically that's it just clips of like people trying to play horizon and having it just chug over and
[4382.28 --> 4388.76]  over again um other various games where it's very very laggy and it it doesn't seem like they're using
[4388.76 --> 4394.68]  it in super wild scenarios like most of these things is someone sitting on a couch um so like
[4394.68 --> 4400.12]  it doesn't feel like they're putting it in a disadvantageous position or anything so yeah
[4400.84 --> 4407.80]  my takeaway was just rough reviews are out for the playstation portal the portable device that allows
[4407.80 --> 4417.32]  wi-fi remote play connected to a playstation 5 and only a playstation 5 many reviewers spoke highly
[4417.32 --> 4423.64]  of the play experience while others criticized the concept of a single purpose portable especially
[4423.64 --> 4428.44]  one that lacks a web browser making it impossible to use with public wi-fi that has any kind of
[4428.44 --> 4435.32]  verification on it or authentication it also cannot connect to bluetooth headphones meaning that users
[4435.32 --> 4441.48]  who want wireless audio will have to pay over a hundred dollars for playstation pulse earbuds or
[4441.48 --> 4448.76]  headphones when they come out in the coming months nevertheless nevertheless many have defended the
[4448.76 --> 4455.88]  portal as a great dad device allowing them to allow their roommates or children to have the tv without
[4455.88 --> 4461.88]  giving up on gaming time the portal has been quickly selling out with some scalpers selling it for over
[4461.88 --> 4470.20]  double its msrp does any of that change how you feel about it at all i i want to know i want to know
[4470.20 --> 4473.48]  what the audience thinks of this too hold on i'm gonna i'm gonna do a poll here
[4474.04 --> 4478.92]  poll time as far as i can tell if something has the playstation brand on it it's going to be sold out and
[4478.92 --> 4483.00]  scalped to all hell for a pretty significant period of time um
[4485.00 --> 4490.52]  i don't know maybe maybe uh playstation needs to try to poach somebody from valve so they can figure out
[4490.52 --> 4495.40]  um pre-making enough stock of things before they launch it i'm not sure
[4497.88 --> 4505.56]  yeah these are going for around 300 bucks it looks so like yeah here's 14 bids 15 minutes left a little
[4505.56 --> 4514.76]  over 300 for a playstation portal ships next business day in hand um that is uh over a hundred dollars
[4514.76 --> 4526.92]  higher than the msrp for this thing which is 199 so oh man how do i do this my review is largely
[4528.44 --> 4538.52]  quite positive oh interesting that's cool to hear i am not thrilled about the lack of bluetooth i hope
[4538.52 --> 4543.80]  that sony will backpedal on that there should be nothing that would prevent them from making
[4543.80 --> 4551.88]  bluetooth work in the future i'm not aware of any modern wi-fi uh wi-fi chipset that doesn't also
[4551.88 --> 4559.88]  handle bluetooth so the fact that it has wi-fi at all means it has bluetooth um so i would i would like to
[4559.88 --> 4568.76]  see them address that uh there are there are some other things that i'm not super happy about i think
[4568.76 --> 4576.52]  the battery life could have been improved however however however however the thing that i think a lot
[4576.52 --> 4584.12]  of people are overlooking here shoot i missed the results of that poll what happened to it doesn't it
[4584.12 --> 4592.04]  normally stay in the chat until i dismiss it did someone dismiss it okay well uh they have durations
[4592.04 --> 4597.24]  it might have expired okay but uh it's it's in the wait the playstation portal one yeah i think you just
[4597.24 --> 4604.84]  shrank it no i didn't i didn't do anything okay well results are four percent of people said yes 35 of
[4604.84 --> 4613.96]  people said meh and 61 of people said no but you're talking to a pc audience yeah that's
[4613.96 --> 4621.64]  true okay so hear me out at 200 like a bunch of these those sorry to interrupt but a bunch of
[4621.64 --> 4625.88]  these those are probably people that don't even own playstation so why would they buy the the portable
[4625.88 --> 4633.56]  thing okay but i didn't ask would you buy i just said playstation portal you know i know yes no okay
[4633.56 --> 4640.44]  anyway you know how people answer this that's true the point is i think if we consider the functionality
[4640.44 --> 4647.08]  it's pretty compelling obviously you could get a backbone for your phone that's something we talk
[4647.08 --> 4651.00]  about you just get like a little controller for your phone but it's not going to have nearly the
[4651.00 --> 4658.28]  ergonomics of the portal it feels like a dual sense controller which it is because it basically is it's a
[4658.28 --> 4662.84]  dual sense controller with a with an eight inch screen in the middle that's another major factor that
[4662.84 --> 4667.96]  screen is way bigger than what you're going to have on a almost any phone
[4670.92 --> 4677.40]  i think that for the functionality if you're the kind of person who would use it it's a pretty good
[4677.40 --> 4686.44]  price it's extremely easy to use and if you have good wi-fi we found it worked pretty reliably the
[4686.44 --> 4693.40]  other major justification for it is that how what like what would you have wanted them to do i guess
[4693.40 --> 4699.56]  would be my my follow-up question if they had opened it up i think there would have been a strong
[4699.56 --> 4704.68]  business case for needing the price to be higher because all of a sudden you'd have people buying this
[4704.68 --> 4709.88]  thing just to stream their pc games or their xbox or you know whatever the case may or watch movies or
[4709.88 --> 4715.56]  whatever and they would have to actually make money on it to make this make any sense on their balance sheet
[4715.56 --> 4720.44]  instead they took a very console-like approach to it and we break it down in the video
[4721.56 --> 4731.64]  for 200 it's a lot of hardware you are getting a dual sense controller you are getting a battery you
[4731.64 --> 4738.44]  are getting a mid-tier qualcomm soc you are getting an eight inch screen you're getting wi-fi storage ram
[4740.52 --> 4744.92]  you're getting presumably some kind of margin for sony's retail partners that they have to distribute
[4744.92 --> 4753.00]  these things through how could they have possibly gone any tighter on the margins for this 200 is a
[4753.00 --> 4758.68]  really compelling price it's a lot of money 200 is a freaking lot of money for an accessory for a
[4759.16 --> 4768.60]  450 device right like if you told me hey yeah here's an accessory for your you know 50 000 car it costs 25
[4768.60 --> 4772.92]  grand i'd be sitting here going are you like are you kidding me right like that doesn't make any sense so this
[4772.92 --> 4780.84]  is obviously a very expensive accessory but as someone who used game streaming a lot on a device
[4780.84 --> 4787.96]  that frankly didn't have much utility outside of just streaming from my pc the nvidia shield portable
[4787.96 --> 4796.04]  the original one the little clamshell like game controller with a screen on it one um i loved and if i
[4796.04 --> 4803.00]  recall correctly it was actually priced higher than this and other than playing some basic android games
[4803.00 --> 4808.60]  which if you guys remember at the time didn't really exist with proper controller support there was
[4808.60 --> 4814.20]  almost nothing right so aside from playing some android games the only thing it did was stream from
[4814.20 --> 4823.00]  your pc and in my mind this is the same thing but a really smooth setup experience like it's it's it's normie
[4823.00 --> 4827.88]  proof it's it's actually a very friendly setup experience and for playstation
[4833.96 --> 4840.36]  yeah i um i i think just off the top of my head like usd i think a playstation dual sense controller
[4840.36 --> 4845.56]  is like 60 bucks um so there's like a huge portion of your cost right there
[4845.56 --> 4854.04]  oh that was terrible please don't do that oh sorry yeah no you're good i can't even tell you to turn
[4854.04 --> 4862.36]  away from the mic to cough because it's attached to your head everybody get in line everybody turn and
[4862.36 --> 4869.48]  cough sorry it's the lyric from a song oh anyway this one you guys i think dan was was referencing uh
[4869.48 --> 4875.64]  chocolate rain not not your old boomer is it his advice is extremely sound and reasonable
[4878.20 --> 4885.32]  yeah so so this one you guys shield portable 16 gigs let's go this thing still costs as much as the stupid portal
[4887.40 --> 4891.96]  that's kind of weird actually oh they're like kind of a collector's item or something now i think
[4891.96 --> 4895.96]  i saw someone trying to sell a dev kit for like a thousand dollars or something a while ago
[4895.96 --> 4901.72]  obviously they weren't going to get that much for it but uh hey it was worth an effort to a collector
[4901.72 --> 4907.40]  worth worth a try to see if you can find a collector or something yeah yeah
[4910.44 --> 4915.48]  next topic well what did i convince you of anything or do you just you still think it's stupid or what
[4915.48 --> 4922.52]  come on help me out here no i don't i don't think it's stupid necessarily if if it works well like uh
[4922.52 --> 4928.36]  if the lagging problem is not a thing um i mean it's a thing you're gonna have to have good wi-fi
[4930.20 --> 4935.72]  like i don't know if you remember this but i bought a ruckus access point because i was having so much
[4935.72 --> 4942.84]  trouble with streaming to my shield yeah like you you need a good access point and that doesn't mean
[4942.84 --> 4951.96]  an expensive one it's a good one sorry does it support wi-fi six no that's another big
[4951.96 --> 4959.40]  however however however the difference in the differences between wi-fi five and five uh wi-fi
[4959.40 --> 4966.12]  five and wi-fi six are not nearly as noticeable to the average consumer as the differences between
[4966.12 --> 4973.80]  wi-fi six and wi-fi six e unintuitively well i i it's like it's messed up man why why are they
[4973.80 --> 4977.40]  gonna why they gotta be like that why can't you just have a naming scheme that makes sense who do you
[4977.40 --> 4984.44]  think you are usb if like i just i can't um so they're trying to compete the main benefits of wi-fi
[4984.44 --> 4994.76]  six over wi-fi five are to do with large deployments with many clients connected so range and throughput
[4994.76 --> 5002.60]  to a single device are are are not markedly different um going from five to six but they are
[5002.60 --> 5009.00]  going from six to six e now that would have been a game changer for this if it supported wi-fi six e
[5009.64 --> 5017.56]  and if you had your playstation wired because remember if your playstation is on wi-fi it's wi-fi
[5017.56 --> 5023.80]  six right so having six e on the portal would just be added cost for no reason whatsoever for that use
[5023.80 --> 5030.12]  case but if the playstation was wired and you had a wi-fi six e portable device that would result in a
[5031.00 --> 5035.96]  much better streaming experience but the thing is that wouldn't be two hundred dollars that's the
[5035.96 --> 5041.48]  thing that i think a lot of people are missing on the portal is sony is not gouging on this thing
[5042.20 --> 5049.88]  they are charging as far as i can tell the bare barest minimum that they have to to make this thing
[5049.88 --> 5057.00]  make any sense to ship at all because they want to sell more software that's the play here and i just
[5057.00 --> 5060.84]  i feel like a lot of people are missing that and they're just looking at it going oh this thing's
[5060.84 --> 5065.32]  stupid it's like yeah sure it's kind of stupid but at two hundred dollars it's allowed to be a
[5065.32 --> 5070.04]  little bit stupid it's allowed to be more of an appliance in my mind and i have some hope that it will
[5070.04 --> 5077.32]  get hacked apparently it's running android 13 people are already that far but they figured out what exactly
[5077.32 --> 5083.96]  is going on in this thing so i feel like it's got to be a matter of time before someone jailbreaks it i uh
[5083.96 --> 5090.92]  that could be very fun that could be pretty cool but i feel like that's probably a big part of why sony
[5090.92 --> 5097.48]  is not putting a web browser on it because that can be a significant point of ingress for
[5098.20 --> 5103.56]  um attempts to kind of break into these devices right yeah
[5103.56 --> 5112.28]  and yeah mikaio says uh lacking bluetooth headphone support is not reasonable you know what
[5113.32 --> 5118.44]  that's that is ridiculous that's fair enough and and i i go after that hard in the video
[5119.00 --> 5127.00]  that's 3.5 minutes jack yes and the speakers are pretty good so it's not like you don't have other
[5127.00 --> 5132.20]  options but not supporting bluetooth audio blows i would yeah i would i would swing at them for the
[5132.20 --> 5136.60]  no bluetooth audio as well but having a 3.5 mil jack and having good speakers is like
[5137.80 --> 5141.88]  i don't know i would just plug in headphones and i'm pretty upset me that much personally i'm pretty
[5141.88 --> 5147.88]  upset about the battery life it's less than half of what the logitech g cloud does and the g cloud is
[5147.88 --> 5154.36]  as an another example of a of a streaming first device that you know i thought was stupid and then
[5154.36 --> 5161.32]  ultimately liked even if it's for different reasons um than than the the playstation portal
[5162.20 --> 5166.60]  uh all right is it time to uninstall edge
[5172.60 --> 5179.64]  in order to comply in order to comply with the eu digital markets act microsoft will soon allow
[5179.64 --> 5186.76]  windows 10 and 11 users in the european economic area oh man really to uninstall all windows apps
[5186.76 --> 5195.48]  including camera photos edge and even bing windows will likewise respect apps default browsers and allow
[5195.48 --> 5201.24]  users to choose if they want their microsoft account to sync data across devices so our discussion
[5201.24 --> 5207.48]  question here is so when are you setting your location to hungary and deleting all of this stuff
[5208.68 --> 5216.12]  yeah i wonder i wonder how specific they're going to be about um like detecting if you're on a vpn and
[5216.12 --> 5221.96]  and like undoing stuff if you fall off of it or something like that a q1 william g is what we're
[5221.96 --> 5229.72]  aiming for for the precision go ahead uh but yeah like i i that would be interesting because if if you can
[5229.72 --> 5236.28]  just like set your location or vpn out or something like that um oh yeah i would absolutely do that oh my
[5236.28 --> 5242.52]  goodness there's no way that this is not going to be possible to spoof it's got to be like someone's
[5242.52 --> 5247.96]  like you would come up with a pie like yeah it would happen where you just reroute everything from
[5248.76 --> 5257.16]  from that machine like it like and like even if you had to go as far as to have another virtual
[5257.16 --> 5261.08]  interface or something like that you wouldn't even need another physical interface you would just have
[5261.08 --> 5268.76]  to take um like i would imagine it would operate probably similarly to the way that people will alter
[5268.76 --> 5274.76]  their um uh which file is it like host name file or whatever it is when you're trying to
[5274.76 --> 5279.48]  go to pirated activation servers you know what i'm talking about right what's that what's that
[5279.48 --> 5282.92]  long time what's that stupid i don't remember i know what you're talking about yeah i don't remember
[5282.92 --> 5288.20]  the last time that i tried to pirate windows it just doesn't really come up a lot now that you can
[5288.20 --> 5293.40]  yeah hosts file there you go so i would imagine that there's something along those lines that someone
[5293.40 --> 5300.36]  will figure out and we'll be able to just kind of go yep i'm finished now finished with this
[5306.52 --> 5309.08]  thanks for acknowledging me it was pretty good
[5311.96 --> 5316.52]  uh yeah or it could be a registry change or something like that i'm i'm i'm pretty excited
[5316.52 --> 5323.32]  though because i just i don't know why you want it it shouldn't bother me that much like why does it
[5323.32 --> 5329.16]  bother me that you know i open i don't know a pdf or something and it opens in the edge reader because
[5329.16 --> 5333.48]  i haven't set it up to open something else on this machine it's just like no i just i just never
[5333.48 --> 5339.16]  actually want to see this application jayden brings up a really good point of like where where does this
[5339.16 --> 5344.84]  stop company-wise like this just hit microsoft uh but jayden specifically said will this apply to samsung
[5344.84 --> 5351.48]  phones too um my goodness this being able to work on phones would be amazing i might actually end up
[5351.48 --> 5358.44]  going back to samsung i really liked samsung back in like the s3 days um but then a lot of the samsung
[5358.44 --> 5365.16]  specific software that you can't get rid of i hate it so much that i like won't go back but if they made
[5365.16 --> 5370.28]  it so you could actually get rid of it and you could get it back more towards a stock android experience
[5370.28 --> 5377.16]  there's some samsung phones that are really nice yeah they'll be very i wonder if samsung has a
[5377.16 --> 5383.40]  dominant enough position that they would go after them for this but either way like good guy eu i feel
[5383.40 --> 5390.92]  like every other week we're talking about something cool that the eu is doing to finally crack down on
[5390.92 --> 5399.08]  these tech monopolies and keep them from abusing their position like where what when did the us
[5399.08 --> 5406.36]  government lose their fangs and claws yeah they they they slashed microsoft super super super hard
[5408.60 --> 5415.08]  they they ripped apart at&t slashed microsoft and then just lost all their teeth i don't get it
[5415.72 --> 5420.12]  probably because of insane amounts of lobbying i'm assuming from the results of both of those
[5420.12 --> 5430.52]  uh moves okay to be clear guys i get it i just am frustrated i know how and why it happened i just don't like it
[5432.28 --> 5436.44]  oh man oh wow
[5438.84 --> 5445.48]  all right um hey we don't really have this in the topics but uh
[5445.48 --> 5449.64]  uh
[5450.36 --> 5451.64]  oh man uh
[5451.64 --> 5451.72]  uh
[5451.72 --> 5455.64]  i think we don't yeah
[5457.48 --> 5461.80]  let's just let's just say this um we did allude to it in the pre-show so
[5461.80 --> 5472.20]  uh twitter it or it's sorry x uh i actually have a hard time calling it that uh has lost some major
[5472.20 --> 5480.28]  sponsors after ceo or no he's not ceo anymore but whatever owner uh elon musk expressed um
[5483.16 --> 5489.24]  agreement with a with a tweet that some have perceived to be anti-semitic
[5489.24 --> 5499.32]  um and they are losing sponsors like crazy according to reports um here's something though
[5499.88 --> 5504.60]  listed among the major sponsors that are pulling out um is ibm
[5504.60 --> 5515.40]  when's the last time you ever saw an ibm ad i get them for what infrastructure stuff okay
[5516.04 --> 5522.68]  like infrastructure as a service or like hardware or like software honestly i i don't really look into
[5522.68 --> 5529.96]  them but i i do get ibm ads um fascinating ibm's one of those companies that like we did a tech
[5529.96 --> 5534.76]  wiki about it i think even i i think it was like what does ibm actually do like you know
[5536.28 --> 5543.40]  because own patent yeah own more patents than anyone yeah fair enough um but they're actually
[5543.40 --> 5546.36]  another one of the ones that pulled out is another one of those companies that as
[5546.36 --> 5553.32]  as mostly a consumer slash small business owner i i just i you know i hear about them in the news all
[5553.32 --> 5557.88]  the time i know their ceo's name and he's like super famous or rich or whatever but like oracle
[5557.88 --> 5566.20]  the is oracle actually do i i don't know something presumably yeah oracle is a fun one yeah um but
[5566.20 --> 5571.24]  anyway oracle ibm comcast xfinity um apple have
[5571.24 --> 5580.04]  oh yeah have uh have basically said yeah no this is uh this is not cool uh media matters posted a
[5580.04 --> 5585.08]  screenshot of an apple ad for a mac computer and an ibm ad next to a post that included an image of
[5585.08 --> 5595.08]  adolf hitler and his followers um yikes so advertisers not super cool with what's going on on uh x formerly
[5595.08 --> 5603.88]  twitter right now and it looks like whoever helped musk make this acquisition is probably going to be
[5603.88 --> 5610.36]  losing a lot of money sometime in the near future uh for my part i just am not seeing the same kind
[5610.36 --> 5615.40]  of engagement on twitter that we used to we've had some we've had some posts this week that were
[5615.40 --> 5622.76]  we're cross-posting in youtube community posts on instagram on twitter and on those other platforms
[5622.76 --> 5628.84]  they're getting tens of thousands in some cases nearly 50 000 interactions from the communities
[5628.84 --> 5635.16]  there and on twitter it's just been this slow decline like occasionally we'll still have ones
[5635.16 --> 5639.64]  that that pop off like i think we had a couple in the last week and a half or so that you know did
[5640.20 --> 5646.60]  10 or 20 000 likes or whatever is luke gone see i told you we should have gone with it he's still in
[5646.60 --> 5652.20]  the call his camera's off wait oh no he's back oh hey we're good okay should have had the technical
[5652.20 --> 5660.68]  difficulties linus yeah i know hold on here i uh um
[5668.68 --> 5679.24]  beautiful beautiful amazing smooth uh yeah i what what i've noticed with with twitter x whatever um is
[5679.24 --> 5683.32]  i i haven't really used it for like public communication for a long time but i have used
[5683.32 --> 5688.28]  it for direct messages to like other creators for quite a while um and something that i'm noticing is
[5689.00 --> 5696.36]  is very slowly but surely over time uh i'm either meeting people and they're at the same time dan i'm
[5696.36 --> 5703.56]  trying to they're they're wanting to communicate over over discord or instagram or something else or even just
[5703.56 --> 5709.24]  text messages or people that i already communicate to through twitter dms are asking to move to one of
[5709.24 --> 5716.12]  those other services um and the amount of times that i'm using twitter dms is is slowly decreasing
[5716.68 --> 5725.16]  um which is like cool because i don't like twitter but also kind of annoying because it was centralized
[5725.16 --> 5730.52]  on twitter almost entirely like all my communication with other creators is almost entirely on twitter for
[5730.52 --> 5737.72]  twitter was the celebrity phone book essentially yes like anyone with any kind i don't mean celebrity
[5737.72 --> 5743.72]  celebrity i just mean anyone with any kind of public presence yeah any kind of public creator of any kind
[5743.72 --> 5750.12]  was on twitter and so you know you could be you could be like oh man you know it'd be crazy if we did
[5750.12 --> 5759.00]  a collab with someone you know some i don't know some wwe star who's into gaming or whatever right uh at the
[5759.00 --> 5763.48]  very least you could you could at them and then if you also had some momentum your community would
[5763.48 --> 5768.76]  see that and they'd like paying them like you could it was like uh the ability to nudge just about
[5769.48 --> 5774.52]  anyone i don't know that's kind of fading away i don't know if we're ever gonna get that again
[5776.68 --> 5782.60]  instagram instagram i think it still works on but i don't i think not as well um
[5782.60 --> 5786.60]  because not everyone's on instagram
[5789.96 --> 5795.40]  maybe i better get on instagram nikita you well what are you gonna ask me about later dan
[5797.16 --> 5803.08]  oh do you want to be asked about it now sure why not um i believe the retro screwdriver
[5803.08 --> 5807.56]  and the noctua screwdriver and the precision are they going to be available for christmas when are
[5807.56 --> 5813.80]  they coming what can you leak for us not christmas uh uh hold on
[5815.56 --> 5819.88]  now i've said something uh uh uh uh we should do sponsors yeah
[5823.40 --> 5828.28]  hold on i'm finding out uh out of those three the retro is launching first
[5829.24 --> 5832.52]  uh i think it's gonna be oh i think it's gonna be very soon
[5832.52 --> 5839.16]  uh should be very very very soon i don't know exactly what day but no there is a chance that
[5839.16 --> 5844.92]  you will be able to order one and have it under the tree but i probably wouldn't guarantee it i think
[5844.92 --> 5846.20]  that's where we're at on that but
[5850.36 --> 5857.00]  oh that's what he said did you say that on stream oh okay retro for christmas maybe some noctua for

[6097.40 --> 6100.52]  who picks the game i think ploof is picking the games
[6102.20 --> 6107.56]  so we're going to see james wants to play mortal kombat one against me apparently so i don't know
[6107.56 --> 6112.92]  we could end up playing some pretty random games here i think all right it's time for a few merch
[6112.92 --> 6118.68]  messages dan yeah so did we get an answer on the noctua yeah uh we did i i told you cool so i'll get rid
[6118.68 --> 6122.76]  rid of that one he had a little dan moment there and he wasn't we're sharing a brain cell today
[6123.56 --> 6128.20]  uh hey lld have any of you wanted to break a non-tech related record
[6130.20 --> 6136.36]  um every time i look into these records i'm like oh yeah there's a reason that that's the record like
[6136.36 --> 6141.56]  i i remember thinking oh yeah what is there a record for like the most times just like bouncing a ball up
[6141.56 --> 6146.60]  and down to yourself off the ground and like i'll look it up in the records like four million times and
[6146.60 --> 6151.56]  they didn't sleep and they were like held up by ropes just to like keep alive while they did this
[6151.56 --> 6159.40]  and i'm sitting here going oh yeah man no i got no interest in that um no not for the moment thank you
[6159.40 --> 6165.72]  though has there ever been a piece of technology that you really liked but were peer pressured into
[6165.72 --> 6173.24]  not using it due to society uh also nope that big and tall when missing out on deals and limited time
[6173.24 --> 6180.12]  designs uh big and tall when yeah we're working on it i know uh what does that mean linus answer the
[6180.12 --> 6185.08]  question uh it means that the team is working on it and the last thing that i would want to do
[6185.08 --> 6191.08]  as a good manager is breathe down their neck it's it'll be done when it's done and when it's done it'll
[6191.08 --> 6198.84]  be great so that's actually a really nice response thank you for that yep yeah everyone just got shut down
[6198.84 --> 6205.88]  by the chief vision officer why is he so confident this sucks uh hey lld first wan show as a float
[6205.88 --> 6212.36]  plane subscriber hey welcome if you could have one game series that's been dead for a long time get a
[6212.36 --> 6215.64]  sequel what would it be pilot wings
[6218.60 --> 6225.16]  that's a pretty good one actually i like that response i played the crap out of pilot wings
[6225.16 --> 6233.32]  uh the super nintendo one not the n64 one oh apparently there was one for 3ds okay that i
[6233.32 --> 6233.96]  actually didn't know
[6238.76 --> 6249.16]  i don't know i want to be what was it did they say reboot sequel sequel yeah pilot wings actually doesn't
[6249.16 --> 6254.04]  really it's not really sequel fodder what are they going to do add more flight instructors
[6254.04 --> 6260.20]  like second tony like i don't yeah i don't really know okay let's let me think let me think let me
[6260.20 --> 6265.24]  think maybe something maybe something else fallout new vegas but by the team that made fallout new
[6265.24 --> 6270.84]  vegas not bethesda fallout 2 vegas got them because i'm kind of uh
[6270.84 --> 6275.48]  uh i think i think bethesda lost their credit
[6279.64 --> 6284.04]  elijah says portal 3 okay controversial take
[6286.44 --> 6291.16]  portal 2 a good sequel not even close to as good as portal 1
[6294.12 --> 6297.40]  yeah i think it's a good sequel though i think it's a good game different game
[6297.40 --> 6303.24]  game no it's not it's the same game that's the problem i had exactly the same problem with portal
[6303.24 --> 6309.72]  2 that i had with zelda tears of the kingdom it was like the sense of the sense of i was never you
[6309.72 --> 6319.08]  were never going to be able to recapture that sense of of joy and wonder and discovery that the first
[6319.08 --> 6326.36]  game had because it was inherently because it's inherently impossible it takes place in the exact same
[6326.36 --> 6333.48]  environment effectively different game same game i think they're different games my favorite part
[6333.48 --> 6343.16]  about portal 2 was that you could co-op that's fair but maybe you had friends so i and and i i
[6343.16 --> 6348.92]  wanted to play with yvonne but she gets motion sick playing portal when she goes through the portals
[6348.92 --> 6355.80]  especially the the like momentum based ones like and puzzles that she she can't she will actually throw up
[6356.36 --> 6363.56]  if she tries to play portal yeah i guess two or three more topics uh well hold on we haven't
[6363.56 --> 6371.48]  actually figured out a game that needs a sequel yet i want a ps1 game made by square called einhander
[6371.48 --> 6378.52]  to have a sequel oh did you ever play that no that's a it's like a side-scrolling shooter but i want a
[6378.52 --> 6386.04]  sequel to poipoi it's a good choice did you play poipoi i think so again i'm bad with names
[6388.04 --> 6395.88]  so this is poipoi it's like uh it's like a weird isometric sort of top-down like arena brawler
[6395.88 --> 6402.68]  thing um absolutely not oh yeah no poipoi is sick here here here here okay here we go here we go so this
[6402.68 --> 6409.96]  is what a typical why am i not able to okay there we go this is what a typical map might look like
[6409.96 --> 6417.56]  so here's your characters and you could like pick up rocks and logs and bombs and huck them at each
[6417.56 --> 6422.84]  other uh there's a game for android called bomb squad that's actually kind of cool and kind of like
[6422.84 --> 6428.52]  this but i don't know poipoi just had this like jank vibe that i always really liked okay oh man dang it
[6428.52 --> 6436.44]  it doesn't need a sequel though okay crap um fine final fantasy tactics needs an actual sequel there
[6437.80 --> 6445.88]  all all mine i think are just like i want another game in this line but not made by the company that
[6445.88 --> 6453.32]  currently has the rights to make it like i want a halo game not made by 343 right
[6453.32 --> 6461.96]  i want a fallout game or a sky or a uh elder scrolls game or a starfield based game at this
[6461.96 --> 6469.00]  point not made by bethesda i want like i i that that's most of my desire is the the company that
[6469.00 --> 6476.68]  currently owns it is is not in good graces with me at least um but games i would throw out for would
[6476.68 --> 6481.96]  be probably like slay the spire and ftl i think both of those both of the companies behind those
[6481.96 --> 6488.12]  games are trying to move on creatively to other types of things um and i would really like if they
[6488.12 --> 6492.60]  just made another version of what they already made but i understand why they probably just want
[6492.60 --> 6497.88]  to move on because they're very small teams um they're indie teams and they're probably more driven
[6497.88 --> 6504.52]  by the creativity of making games than just the the money so they don't want to just cash in on sequels but
[6504.52 --> 6512.52]  i would definitely buy them if they did what about another starcraft
[6515.16 --> 6523.32]  but not by blizzard yeah see like that's that's okay i got i got one uh you love you love anno 1800
[6523.32 --> 6531.48]  whoops that's not the one starcraft but by the people that did anno oh uh no no oh yeah no the
[6531.48 --> 6538.20]  the ano developers are fantastic yeah they should make it i actually yes yeah they actually made anno
[6538.20 --> 6542.68]  in space and i think it's widely considered to be one of the worst ones that's what put me off of anno
[6543.40 --> 6548.68]  that's where i started and you're like you're like get 1800 and i bought 1800 immediately i started
[6548.68 --> 6556.12]  what do you think and i'm like okay i uh i need to limit myself nice yeah yeah yeah i was immediately
[6556.12 --> 6561.96]  taken aback about how like the quality of life stuff for drawing roads and like you can drag to
[6561.96 --> 6568.44]  produce buildings in a big grid and it was just yep city skyline's dev should probably have paid played
[6568.44 --> 6577.64]  anno it's like once so good dude and they do such a good job now with the with the npcs like constantly
[6577.64 --> 6584.28]  talking you absolutely crazy second you have six different things you could be doing right now i i played it
[6584.28 --> 6590.44]  for for for maybe 20 minutes 30 minutes something like that and i could just immediately see why you
[6590.44 --> 6596.92]  are obsessed with it yeah it's good taste good taste yeah it's so good it's such a good game what if we
[6596.92 --> 6606.28]  what if we what if we bring back after party and we do a three-player co-op anno is this going to cut
[6606.28 --> 6616.36]  into super checks time i'm sure we could do both well i mean i always have some stuff to do after
[6616.36 --> 6622.92]  when so you could do super checks while we get set up for that interesting oh here's the problem though
[6622.92 --> 6629.48]  boys i don't think you can really do an anno session that's shorter than a couple of hours and get
[6629.48 --> 6636.12]  realistically anything done so wan show typically runs for anywhere from three to four hours super
[6636.12 --> 6641.56]  checks time is like 45 minutes to an hour at this point if we do a best of five and luke actually
[6641.56 --> 6648.52]  manages to win one which i mean in fairness doesn't happen that often hey and then if we add two hours
[6648.52 --> 6653.64]  of anno we're we're not going to leave the office till monday morning we might as well just stay here
[6653.64 --> 6659.08]  well you could go home on mondays because you don't work and yeah that'll be fine
[6662.52 --> 6668.28]  oh man uh okay yeah i've got people saying supreme commander there's definitely some spiritual
[6668.28 --> 6674.04]  spiritual successors in the works yep yep yeah and i think the forged alliance forever community has
[6674.04 --> 6679.08]  actually done a great job of keeping supreme commander relevant uh you know it's it's kind of like how
[6679.08 --> 6686.04]  how you don't really need a sequel to i don't know what's an example of a game that has kind of
[6686.04 --> 6692.52]  stayed um stayed relevant to its core audience even if it's kind of niche okay eve online do you need an eve
[6692.52 --> 6700.68]  too yeah or has eve evolved evolved enough that it can just still be eve and it can just be eve forever
[6701.64 --> 6706.60]  hasn't played in a long time um so i don't know if i'm the right voice for this but i'm going to do it
[6706.60 --> 6713.80]  anyways um i think eve is fine um chemo bob to super mario rpg and i actually wouldn't disagree with
[6713.80 --> 6723.24]  that the the recent remake which by the way looks incredible i'm actually not buying it just because i
[6724.36 --> 6729.88]  by chance i i replayed super mario rpg like two months before the announcement came out
[6730.68 --> 6736.20]  like i didn't i didn't know i was just like man you know what was awesome super mario rpg i'm going to
[6736.20 --> 6742.92]  play it because um emily saw one at um at willow video actually luke and was like hey i know you
[6742.92 --> 6747.72]  love this game um do you want one it's a good price and i was like yeah sure and then it was just sitting
[6747.72 --> 6752.28]  on my shelf staring at me and i was like well i'm obviously i'm not going to put it in a super
[6752.28 --> 6756.68]  nintendo to play it because that's just completely backwards at this point i'm going to play it on
[6757.40 --> 6764.36]  something else with an emulator because i have places to be um and so i you know i wasn't going to play
[6764.36 --> 6768.44]  the actual cartridge but i'm sitting here going what i'm going to pay like 150 for this game or
[6768.44 --> 6771.64]  whatever it was i'm not going to just i'm not going to play the stupid thing no damn it i'm going to
[6771.64 --> 6782.28]  play it so uh so so i played it so i'm seeing how faithful the remake is is both uh really exciting to
[6782.28 --> 6790.12]  me because i love that they did that i love that they didn't with it right it was a masterpiece is a
[6790.12 --> 6798.28]  masterpiece and if they had gone and like just arbitrarily changed it i i i think they could
[6798.28 --> 6803.64]  have lost what made it so special but then i'm also disappointed because i don't need to play it
[6803.64 --> 6808.36]  right now and everyone's all hyped about super mario rpg and i kind of just wish it was super mario rpg
[6808.36 --> 6815.72]  too because i i want some new content to enjoy so i um i i do think with how much hype there is around
[6815.72 --> 6822.84]  this game uh that it feels likely that they you know might that might be what that developer is
[6822.84 --> 6826.68]  already working on or something i don't i don't know i don't actually know who did the adaptation
[6826.68 --> 6831.24]  for them or if they're even a nintendo internal team um i think someone knows and posted at some
[6831.24 --> 6838.04]  point but i don't know um so i i'd love to see that happen in a nutshell i know the paper mario series
[6838.04 --> 6844.36]  is like kind of a spiritual successor to it but yeah new new super mario rpg man that'd be super cool
[6844.36 --> 6849.96]  i liked paper mario i played quite a bit of paper mario back in the day i don't remember what ones
[6849.96 --> 6856.52]  but multiple paper mario games i played and enjoyed they were fun uh lucky drive yes um there's a really
[6856.52 --> 6860.60]  good multiplayer hockey game it's called slapshot rebound it's free to play it's really fun you don't
[6860.60 --> 6864.44]  have to buy any of the cosmetics you can have a really excellent experience without paying for
[6864.44 --> 6873.64]  anything uh lots of fun very funky controls uh i wish you luck yeah yeah it's tough but it's fun
[6873.64 --> 6884.52]  oh more topics yeah sure we can do that um google sues for dmca abuse google has launched a lawsuit
[6885.00 --> 6891.80]  against 22 people that it says weaponized the dmca by creating dozens of fake google accounts
[6891.80 --> 6896.36]  and submitting fraudulent takedown notices against over a hundred thousand website urls belonging to
[6896.36 --> 6902.36]  their competitors in the printed t-shirt industry the notices were typically filed under the names of
[6902.36 --> 6907.56]  large organizations like amazon the los angeles lakers and twitter as well as famous celebrities
[6907.56 --> 6913.56]  like elon musk taylor swift and levar burton attacks against big ad buyers led to the loss of
[6913.56 --> 6920.68]  millions of dollars in revenue for both the target companies and for google now i can't say that i'm
[6920.68 --> 6927.24]  happy that this is what it took for google to finally stand up to fraudulent dmca claims but i will say
[6927.24 --> 6935.64]  that i'm really happy it's happening because if this becomes legal precedent um then i think that
[6935.64 --> 6943.48]  i hope that organizations particularly ones with money will think twice before using dmca claims just to
[6943.48 --> 6951.80]  get their way and rip down content that makes them unhappy yeah in other news rivian sat on the wrong button
[6951.80 --> 6957.64]  this week they sent an ota update that put an estimated three percent of their vehicles infotainment
[6957.64 --> 6964.44]  systems out of commission some requiring physical repairs the company accidentally sent out an
[6964.44 --> 6970.28]  income incorrect update build with the wrong security certificates which stalled before it completed
[6970.28 --> 6976.28]  installing rendering the system and the main instrument displays unusable rivian blamed the error on a
[6976.84 --> 6981.48]  fat finger and said that they would prioritize addressing the needs of customers that were
[6981.48 --> 6988.68]  impacted by this mistake now our discussion question says how does a company this size
[6988.68 --> 6993.48]  end up sending out an update this disastrous accidentally and i will say as the chief
[6993.48 --> 6999.88]  vision officer of a company that has made some pretty um egregious blunders in the last calendar year
[7000.68 --> 7008.04]  you'd be surprised communication's not easy um and the bigger you get the bigger the chances that you'll
[7008.04 --> 7014.28]  have if if anything i would say the odds of a bigger company doing this is better than the odds of a
[7014.28 --> 7019.88]  small company that's like a tightly knit team that all work together with each other every day um
[7022.52 --> 7027.16]  but still it's obvious that they need some some process improvements to ensure that something like
[7027.16 --> 7034.04]  this will never happen again i i can pretty much guarantee you there will at least be process changes as a result of
[7034.04 --> 7040.52]  this um time will tell if they're improvements or not but somebody's gonna want things to change just
[7041.24 --> 7048.44]  to say they change something yeah exactly like something's gonna happen um and i honestly i've i've
[7048.44 --> 7057.00]  heard stories from a huge range of developers uh out there of just horrifying things that have happened at
[7057.00 --> 7064.44]  companies that you would never guess um vng supernova says i work for a very large travel company as a
[7064.44 --> 7070.52]  software dev i've pushed breaking changes to production multiple times the worst wasn't noticed until 12
[7070.52 --> 7076.68]  hours later uh thanks for your application uh unfortunately we've decided to go in a different direction supernova
[7076.68 --> 7081.16]  um
[7081.16 --> 7081.32]  um
[7085.16 --> 7092.52]  got it uh okay man is that it i think that's all our topics there's one more it's kind of boring i'm not
[7092.52 --> 7102.44]  interested in it i think it's time for when show after dark okay which is very very light for me
[7102.44 --> 7109.80]  oh right it's very very early in the day it's it's 122 for me right now
[7112.28 --> 7119.16]  but it's 122 on saturday right gotta love that international date line
[7121.56 --> 7129.64]  yep all right dan we ready to do this thing i think we are i'm uh i'm a little behind so we'll see
[7129.64 --> 7136.52]  i am very i wouldn't call you a small ass well that's kind of you get it
[7138.36 --> 7145.32]  get it well yeah i mean i was gonna be a large ass get it no luke i get no acknowledgement for that
[7146.20 --> 7150.04]  i wouldn't call you a small ass yeah he said i'm a little behind
[7151.56 --> 7155.80]  ah okay i didn't hear that okay that's the that's the brain leg yeah
[7155.80 --> 7159.72]  the brain cell had to make it to japan
[7163.56 --> 7171.24]  oh gosh uh where are we uh okay uh yeah merch messages let's see uh reordering due to my mail
[7171.24 --> 7177.56]  being stolen again but i love the underwear so worth it question my wife hates my collection of knives
[7177.56 --> 7183.64]  and flashlights what does your significant other despise that you collect large expenses
[7184.84 --> 7186.04]  especially real estate
[7188.20 --> 7193.48]  oh yeah you have too many knives oh linus you bought another building yeah another another
[7193.48 --> 7196.76]  stupid warehouse no but honey it's okay we're gonna put a lab in it
[7196.76 --> 7206.76]  i get to buy more expensive stuff because the the things that go in the lab oh they're they're so
[7206.76 --> 7209.64]  cool though let me tell you about them yeah
[7211.64 --> 7220.36]  geez hey dll would the performance differences add up to become a large one if you compared a pc with
[7220.36 --> 7228.44]  premium skews to one with less premium skews of the same parts this is actually a video concept that
[7228.44 --> 7235.00]  i've had on the spreadsheet for probably about three or four years and i i forget what the title i have
[7235.00 --> 7241.08]  for it is i'm not just being rude and sitting on my phone right now i'm trying to find the uh the topic
[7241.08 --> 7249.48]  ideas spreadsheet but uh it is it is not at the top here it is video idea tracker ltt you know i i don't
[7249.48 --> 7255.80]  it doesn't matter the point is i'm uh i have i can explain how the video would work so i wanted to build
[7255.80 --> 7265.08]  the sub-optimal pc basically kind of like what you described at the same price the worst option
[7265.96 --> 7273.72]  right compared to the optimal pc which is at the same price the best option for every component but in
[7273.72 --> 7280.92]  order to do this as accurately as possible i need the lab and it's these kinds of video concepts that
[7280.92 --> 7287.08]  were the main driver for building out the lab because i wanted to be able to say with confidence
[7287.72 --> 7296.12]  hey guys i know that in the grand scheme of things two percent hair and three percent here on this ram
[7296.12 --> 7301.96]  kit or this gpu or uh you know the the the ks version of cpu or you know whatever else the case
[7301.96 --> 7311.48]  may be doesn't really ultimately matter but cumulatively with all of the breadth of testing that we can do
[7311.48 --> 7317.56]  we think we can guide you to eight percent better you know whatever right um and i'm i'm really excited
[7317.56 --> 7324.84]  to be able to do that but it's going to take time um we're we're we're still we're still learning a lot
[7324.84 --> 7330.84]  um there's there's there's growing pains right it's a it's a big team and it's growing um and we're
[7330.84 --> 7336.44]  gaining experience and um we're we're smoothing out our communication and our workflows but these things
[7336.44 --> 7342.52]  are not things that happen overnight as i think we've all uh observed and we're gonna get there but we
[7342.52 --> 7350.92]  we need a little bit more time hi lld last week in australia optus had an outage lasting over seven
[7350.92 --> 7358.20]  hours affecting 10 million customers the company says the outage was caused by an international peering
[7358.20 --> 7366.68]  network how would ltd handle this issue well thankfully we aren't a gigantic isp so it's not our problem
[7366.68 --> 7375.48]  i think you know what he meant no actually i don't how would you handle that's way above my pay grade
[7375.48 --> 7382.92]  dude how would you handle not having internet for seven hours oh i see if like no one had internet
[7382.92 --> 7390.84]  oh well no that's simple because we store the vast majority of our assets on our local network right so
[7390.84 --> 7396.36]  if you need to edit a video you're going to have everything that you need on the local network which
[7396.36 --> 7401.56]  you don't need internet to access and then what you would probably do is you would create placeholders
[7401.56 --> 7405.56]  for assets that you'll just go get later and put markers on your timeline that's how the video
[7405.56 --> 7410.76]  editors would work the writers would just have to make put placeholders in their scripts for things
[7410.76 --> 7414.68]  that they're going to have to validate later you figure out later no this is this is absolutely
[7414.68 --> 7419.56]  something that we could work around and have worked around uh we've even uploaded we've even
[7419.56 --> 7425.64]  edited and uploaded that day's video in power outages before never mind internet outages we
[7425.64 --> 7428.20]  got this let's go bring it on
[7431.40 --> 7437.96]  hello dl luke how has met suri been so far watching samet and ltt crossover has been entertaining
[7439.32 --> 7445.16]  it's been awesome actually i i went i went drifting yesterday had some fun was able to do
[7445.80 --> 7450.68]  uh a linkage where i was i was drifting in one direction and then i i pulled it in tight and was
[7450.68 --> 7454.60]  able to switch and start drifting the other direction it was rough but it it technically
[7454.60 --> 7462.04]  happened um and that wasn't actually technically matsuri matsuri technically started today and i
[7462.04 --> 7467.32]  haven't been at it because i have been uh gracing the wanshow with my president should we let you go
[7467.32 --> 7473.96]  soon i'm sorry but i i'll go when we're done it's fine um but yeah i'll be i'll be going up there
[7473.96 --> 7479.00]  everybody else is already up there so i'm probably gonna have to get a taxi which is incredibly
[7479.00 --> 7487.64]  expensive here so far i've actually been surprised at how inexpensive many things are but holy try to
[7487.64 --> 7494.36]  not take taxis when you're here do anything you can to avoid that um but yeah i'll be heading up there
[7494.36 --> 7498.84]  and then matsuri goes like overnight as far as my understanding goes so i'll be up there for
[7498.84 --> 7506.36]  quite a while um and i'm sure it'll be very fun i've done a bunch of ride-alongs um with with samet
[7506.36 --> 7512.68]  who is very good at drifting and doing what he does and uh i think it was yesterday
[7514.28 --> 7519.88]  we were within a foot of someone else's door like our my door was within a foot of someone else's door
[7519.88 --> 7527.32]  while we were going like i think it was like 60 or 70 miles an hour sideways um which was wild and then
[7527.32 --> 7531.16]  when they correct it out so they were sliding beside each other when they correct it out
[7531.16 --> 7538.60]  the front bumper of our car just barely touched the front the rear bumper of the other car uh but
[7538.60 --> 7545.00]  this is what you're saying it's not very good no it was you guys in front it was sick no i'm kidding
[7545.00 --> 7551.32]  i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i see um but they know this is gonna happen so the
[7551.32 --> 7558.68]  bumpers only held on by like four zap straps so it just like pinged off we didn't even like feel any
[7558.68 --> 7563.56]  impact whatsoever in the car uh we were able to retrieve the bumper and and get it back on
[7563.56 --> 7569.96]  afterwards and everything was totally fine uh but yeah it's it's been it's been very very fun um
[7569.96 --> 7574.84]  hanging out with samet and and the rest of the people here and i'll be excited to go back up
[7574.84 --> 7582.44]  hey linus alexander here from australia i've been watching for over 10 years what's some of the visions
[7582.44 --> 7592.76]  you have for ltt in 2024 the big one is uh getting the labs website launched um getting getting content
[7592.76 --> 7601.08]  out taking advantage of all this testing that we're going to be doing um i i want to see ltt move towards
[7601.08 --> 7608.44]  you know more projects um and and less just you know reviews of products um but at the same time
[7609.00 --> 7615.80]  so so do those better but also do a little bit more back to basics product reviews so right now we do a
[7615.80 --> 7622.44]  lot of kind of in between um and i want to have kind of a clearer split where where a big portion of the
[7622.44 --> 7628.36]  content is these like projects extreme um and ultimate tech upgrades and stuff like that and then the other
[7628.36 --> 7633.32]  side is some of the more just like back to basics reviews of products that um that people want to
[7633.32 --> 7639.48]  hear about and i think that one of the struggles we've had is that there's just not as much exciting
[7639.48 --> 7645.56]  innovation in the verticals that we have traditionally participated in like we used to be able to rely on a
[7645.56 --> 7653.24]  gpu launch for millions of views and now with you know amd and nvidia competing with each other to see who
[7653.24 --> 7659.08]  who can release the biggest turd um it's gotten very challenging right and i think you see this not
[7659.08 --> 7669.00]  just with us but with other pc technology centric channels that are either kind of steadily getting
[7669.00 --> 7677.40]  about the same views they always did or even declining as the the pc gaming uh hardware industry gets
[7677.40 --> 7684.84]  more stagnant and more boring right so um you know we've got to figure out a way to to continue to
[7685.96 --> 7691.48]  survive as tech media which means you know yeah if i have to buy some stupid ai pin in order to find
[7691.48 --> 7695.32]  something that's interesting enough to do a review about then yeah that's that's what i'll do because
[7696.44 --> 7705.32]  that's what i do um you know find find whatever is kind of wherever that the development is happening
[7705.32 --> 7712.68]  and learn to get into that because you can't just rely on power supplies to stay interesting forever
[7712.68 --> 7719.08]  i mean i think a perfect example of a category that has really had its ups and downs over the last 10
[7719.08 --> 7728.04]  years is displays right when we first got into this it was all about g-sync so variable refresh rate and
[7728.04 --> 7736.60]  um and high refresh rate and then it was really boring for a bit and then ultra wide it was like
[7736.60 --> 7742.92]  oh we've got man we've got these new form factors that totally change immersiveness and then and then
[7742.92 --> 7747.24]  they were oh man then like the next release they were curved all of a sudden it was like whoa curved
[7747.24 --> 7756.04]  monitors and then no and then oh it was just a barren landscape wasteland for years and then oled hit the
[7756.04 --> 7762.36]  scene it was like game changing and wow now refresh rates are going to 240 480 hertz it's crazy and then
[7763.16 --> 7770.60]  you know i i think that this generation the 2023 refreshed tvs are probably the least excited that
[7770.60 --> 7775.88]  i've seen people about a tv release in the last three or four years so it's just been it's been kind
[7775.88 --> 7781.80]  of all over the place in the in the tv industry so if we were at their mercy then our viewership and
[7781.80 --> 7785.80]  our success as a company would go up and down like that but we can't do that we've got to be
[7785.80 --> 7790.52]  we've got to be looking for you know what people are interested in whether they're buying it or not
[7790.52 --> 7795.88]  honestly it's kind of irrelevant to me i'm not here to sell you anything other than from ltdstore.com
[7795.88 --> 7802.20]  um i'm yeah i'm here to talk about tech i'm here to look at what's cool and exciting right so
[7802.84 --> 7804.92]  um we'll just we'll figure it out
[7804.92 --> 7809.80]  has there been anything you've enjoyed about using the wing
[7812.04 --> 7819.96]  no fidget toy fidget toy no it's not even a good fidget toy um it's it's a it's terrible uh the
[7819.96 --> 7826.12]  the fingerprint sensor works maybe 20 of the time uh half the time i go to wake it i go to just like
[7826.12 --> 7830.60]  press the button it just doesn't wake i have to press it like three times like it's just it's a piece of
[7830.60 --> 7837.08]  of man i don't know what to tell you i've got one here for uh i've got one here for luke linus
[7837.08 --> 7842.04]  we want to go through some of the potentials um we'll have a look at those sure question for luke do
[7842.04 --> 7849.48]  you believe p2p solutions like ipfs uh s could help with floatplane bandwidth costs if i remember
[7849.48 --> 7854.68]  correctly blizzard used to run wow updates with a mix of servers and peer-to-peer to absorb the initial
[7854.68 --> 7862.68]  spike all the examples of usage that i've seen for that uh that that deal with online video have not
[7862.68 --> 7875.32]  worked out um i i think something like file downloads which i understand yeah related um but i i think
[7875.32 --> 7883.88]  something like file downloads where where inconsistency in service is not an issue um i think it's fine um
[7884.68 --> 7891.80]  uh but expecting that next chunk to be there on time every single time because if it's not there
[7891.80 --> 7899.00]  are interruptions in playback of video uh i i think controlling more of that pipeline is more better
[7899.00 --> 7906.28]  or not worse um and that's just gonna be what it is for a while could i see that changing eventually
[7906.28 --> 7917.32]  yeah maybe um but not right now hi when dot dll good morning linus people keep asking about your
[7917.32 --> 7923.48]  beard but why do you keep your earrings for so many years have you thought of removing them also if luke
[7923.48 --> 7929.96]  fights james who will win luke would win no offense james they're not even in a similar weight class
[7929.96 --> 7936.92]  james is like my size um sorry james uh as for as for the earrings i i don't know they're just
[7937.80 --> 7942.76]  they're they're i've had them since i was in grade nine or grade 10 or something like that
[7942.76 --> 7951.00]  and these exact earrings like like these exact hoops and the the one stud that i have i've had for
[7951.56 --> 7955.96]  almost the entire time i've known yvonne so like 15 years or something like that
[7955.96 --> 7960.76]  um at this point they kind of just feel like part of my body i don't really think about them
[7960.76 --> 7967.40]  uh they definitely took a lot more criticism in the early days of the channel it's like oh what are you
[7967.40 --> 7979.00]  gay because you have earrings like a under every single video and b oh my god who cares like yeah right
[7979.00 --> 7984.92]  but i for those of you for the zoomers out there right it's it was a different it was a different
[7984.92 --> 7993.56]  era um that that that was what passed for i i don't know humor i guess i don't know uh i'm not
[7993.56 --> 8000.60]  exaggerating it it was under every actually every single video like a lot of comments it was it was brutal
[8000.60 --> 8007.56]  this is stupid yeah so and and to be clear it's not that i'm offended by being called gay i don't care i
[8007.56 --> 8013.40]  don't think that's a problem i'm not i just happen to not be i just think it's really stupid to look at
[8014.04 --> 8021.64]  piercing and anyway it doesn't it doesn't matter the point is they're there um they don't care get
[8021.64 --> 8029.40]  used to it sorry what am i saying um one of them is actually stuck one of them is fused uh so this stud
[8029.40 --> 8035.96]  does not come off anymore i did actually try to remove it once because um it i forget what it's made
[8035.96 --> 8042.84]  it i think it's gold and uh my daughter's um piercing was having a lot of trouble healing
[8042.84 --> 8050.84]  and so i was like oh i need something that has a longer uh uh what's the i don't know i forget what
[8050.84 --> 8055.32]  it's called pin i forget what it's called but the the the shaft part i need one that had a longer one
[8055.32 --> 8060.76]  so that it wouldn't stick against one side and get all get all goopy and i tried to take mine out and i
[8060.76 --> 8068.04]  actually could not with pliers on both sides like i couldn't it seems to be fused in some way so maybe
[8068.04 --> 8072.44]  it's not made of gold in which case it's maybe good that i never put it in her ear but um i ended up
[8072.44 --> 8076.44]  having to find something else so that one doesn't come out so that's that's part of it at least i'd
[8076.44 --> 8085.32]  have to cut it off yo ldl love the show and looking forward to post that's it dang it thank you post yeah
[8085.32 --> 8091.88]  yeah what you do on twitter now that's not where i would have gone with it it's what you do with
[8091.88 --> 8096.44]  your computer well maybe not your computer my computer it's been having a lot of trouble doing
[8096.44 --> 8101.48]  that lately i'll tell you that that hurts a lot you have no idea how much of that hurts linus
[8102.44 --> 8104.28]  well you have thread ripper so i had some idea
[8106.36 --> 8110.04]  i don't know if linus can talk how many times has your computer broke in the last like six months
[8110.04 --> 8118.20]  actually had an amd driver crash recently updated my radio on drivers and i haven't had another one
[8118.20 --> 8123.88]  but uh man having some second thoughts about my amd challenge conclusion my computer has a
[8124.44 --> 8132.44]  has a hand repaired cpu uh and a gpu that rests on top of the case and it seems to work more than yours
[8132.44 --> 8141.80]  i think i think linux overwrote intel's management engine on the system i'm building right now oh no
[8141.80 --> 8148.52]  and it makes all the temperatures go to negative 200 million degrees and none of the ipmi stuff works
[8148.52 --> 8153.96]  but then if you put a windows disc in it it's great it's the weirdest thing ever anyway um
[8155.40 --> 8159.88]  yo ldl love the show and looking forward to the black friday deals question for the big l
[8159.88 --> 8165.56]  ldl my little girl is now seven months old and i'm worried for her future do you have any concerns
[8165.56 --> 8171.08]  about the future of your daughters they have concerns about the future in general never mind
[8171.08 --> 8178.12]  just for my daughters i have no idea how my kids generation is going to live in vancouver with the
[8178.12 --> 8183.40]  housing affordability issues that we have here i have no idea what the job market is going to look
[8183.40 --> 8189.80]  like when these kids start looking for work and we're at the point now where you know my eldest
[8189.80 --> 8198.04]  is what somewhere between five and ten years from joining the workforce like five and fifteen
[8199.08 --> 8204.36]  like it's this is not some far distant future thing that i'm considering but the problem is that
[8204.36 --> 8209.96]  it's it's enough in the future that we could see significant progression in ai to the point where
[8209.96 --> 8219.24]  there is an actual surplus of meat bags that are needed to just do right like it's it's legitimately
[8219.24 --> 8225.48]  really scary so yes yes i do you're normal
[8229.24 --> 8235.24]  hey alinus remember when i asked about the damage by dennis and colton well on the ltd clip it got some
[8235.24 --> 8241.80]  mixed feedback what are your notes on it also i love the retro stickies most of the really negative
[8241.80 --> 8248.76]  feedback on this clip which seems to be far and away the best viewed video on this channel that is
[8248.76 --> 8257.40]  wild four million dollars on four million dollars no no oh yeah exactly uh four million views on a like
[8257.40 --> 8263.88]  piece of the wan show is pretty unbelievable yeah yeah that's like way way far and away the best
[8263.88 --> 8268.60]  performer most of them are just people misunderstanding the situation which is pretty typical right like
[8268.60 --> 8276.36]  anger to me um and i don't mean you know righteous theory i mean just like like like like like just
[8276.36 --> 8284.92]  anger um often comes from a place of of ignorance or or an inability to fully understand the situation
[8284.92 --> 8290.44]  because um almost it's
[8293.32 --> 8299.64]  unless it's precipitated by someone else's utterly irrational behavior right there's almost never
[8299.64 --> 8305.48]  no reason for something and if you take the time to understand it it can it can change the way you feel
[8305.48 --> 8313.24]  about it is at least sort of my philosophy on it um and a lot of um a lot of people's anger at this clip
[8313.24 --> 8321.24]  about me talking describing being angry um comes from a place of not understanding what happened
[8321.80 --> 8329.00]  a lot of people are extremely uh bothered by the fact that you know here i am complaining about
[8329.00 --> 8333.88]  employees damaging my floor when i should have just had professional contractors work on it in
[8333.88 --> 8337.72]  the first place instead of exploiting them and i'm sitting here going what the are you talking about
[8337.72 --> 8344.76]  they snuck into my house and damaged my floor as part of making a video so they were doing their
[8344.76 --> 8352.04]  jobs they were just f***ing them up um so so i i yeah i mean yeah there's some controversy about the
[8352.04 --> 8357.64]  video but most of it is just people who don't pay attention being people who don't pay attention
[8357.64 --> 8362.76]  and just getting angry i guess i should clarify the the anger thing a little bit again as well because
[8362.76 --> 8367.56]  there are lots of reasons to be legitimately angry about you know even the state of the world even
[8368.36 --> 8375.56]  um but if you're just angry all the time i think a lot of that can come from not taking the time to
[8375.56 --> 8381.48]  to listen and fully understand the situation um and i think we see a lot of those personality types
[8381.48 --> 8389.32]  under a video like that clip where um it's obvious that like okay a typical a typical retention curve
[8389.32 --> 8394.44]  for a video has about half of the people gone by the end of it which means that probably about a
[8394.44 --> 8399.24]  quarter of them are gone by you know the first minute or two so that should give you some idea
[8399.24 --> 8403.56]  that won't prevent people from commenting but that should give you some idea how much of the actual
[8403.56 --> 8413.56]  video has been watched by you know a huge portion of the the youtube community right so this ended up
[8413.56 --> 8419.40]  kind of rambly the point is uh i'm over it i'm not bothered by it but yeah people are angry because
[8419.40 --> 8423.32]  they don't take the time to properly understand but that's that's their problem that's that's not my
[8423.32 --> 8428.28]  problem anymore and i've talked about this before on the show but when i see that kind of stuff like
[8428.28 --> 8438.76]  the um just colossally stupid takes uh or or takes that are obviously based on not paying attention to
[8438.76 --> 8444.36]  the content at all i'm shadow banning them i just i don't have room in my brain for
[8447.64 --> 8455.16]  just that kind of that that kind of nonsense um and and that's not to say that you know if someone
[8455.16 --> 8460.12]  says something critical they're going to get shadow banned that's not the case at all it's if someone
[8460.12 --> 8466.68]  says something that is just so phenomenally stupid that it makes me lose my few functioning brain cells um
[8466.68 --> 8470.44]  i'm just i'm not going to expose myself to it again it just doesn't make any sense
[8472.12 --> 8477.64]  so if you were to post something like uh you know maybe you shouldn't be angry at them you know if
[8477.64 --> 8483.00]  you're exploiting them instead of hiring a professional to move your furniture your shadow
[8483.00 --> 8486.84]  banned like that's not what happened at all and if you had taken the time to pay attention at all you'd
[8486.84 --> 8493.80]  know that so you just you lost you lost being heard privileges sorry and no one's going to miss you
[8493.80 --> 8499.32]  because that's really stupid i'm doing everybody a favor all right all right all right all right
[8500.92 --> 8509.80]  was it you luke yeah yeah i posted that yeah yeah yeah no i i came and held i i'm pretty sure i was
[8509.80 --> 8515.24]  there when we found it right because we were trying to move your stuff properly and then it was discovered
[8515.24 --> 8521.24]  so unhappy or more of it was discovered or something i don't remember it was it was much worse under the
[8521.24 --> 8530.84]  bed than like what's peeking out in front of it yeah yeah hi lld if apple is eventually forced to shut
[8530.84 --> 8539.64]  down the walled garden do you think we will ever see an iphone that natively runs android no no no that's
[8539.64 --> 8551.16]  not the issue that's not like an antitrust problem um no no loving the gpu ornament what is the best ltd
[8551.16 --> 8563.48]  store idea that was rejected so far the uh the lighter snuffer combo i wanted to do a little uh i
[8563.48 --> 8567.96]  wanted to do a lighter that was a butt that had a flame come out of it and you could light candles with
[8567.96 --> 8572.52]  it and then if you pressed a different button it would puff air out the butt and put out the candle
[8573.32 --> 8580.28]  why doesn't this exist who do i have to blame for this linus blame nick light and kyle oh my
[8580.28 --> 8587.32]  goodness i'm gonna go talk to them i think now i'm back on your side people would buy the crap out of
[8587.32 --> 8593.32]  that man well we would we would just only have to sell that north hopper says i would smoke so much weed
[8593.32 --> 8601.72]  with that yeah but would you put it out that's not how this works no no you put it out just to put it
[8601.72 --> 8609.80]  out yeah uh just ordered the new uh limited edition steam deck and love the way it looks what are your
[8609.80 --> 8618.28]  favorite limited edition or uh limited editions of games or tech uh that you have what i don't really
[8618.28 --> 8622.52]  do the collector's edition thing to be honest with you i know luke does a little bit like you just oh you're
[8622.52 --> 8628.04]  not wearing that watch anymore i guess you're over it uh well i i have a hard time wearing like
[8628.04 --> 8633.64]  anything because i just lose it all the time um i actually really like that watch despite maybe not
[8633.64 --> 8641.40]  being so into the game anymore um and will likely continue to wear it if i am like trying to uh
[8643.00 --> 8649.24]  i don't know appear slightly more put together than i normally am i'll say that i was gonna say dress up
[8649.24 --> 8655.08]  but i was like i don't think that's fair um because because yeah i actually actually do quite like that
[8655.08 --> 8661.56]  watch um i think that's actually probably my favorite special edition ever that watch is like
[8662.44 --> 8669.40]  really cool actually works like pretty well build quality seems really good um it's made by because i
[8669.40 --> 8675.72]  want to give credit to the people that actually made it it's made by the wand company i think the name is
[8675.72 --> 8685.32]  called the wand company makers of the world's finest website is loading very slowly yeah i'm pretty sure
[8685.32 --> 8693.08]  it's these these people yes the wand company um they they made the watch and they did a fantastic job
[8693.08 --> 8697.56]  and i hope that they keep working with companies making special editions in the future
[8697.56 --> 8706.20]  uh because that was awesome um very very cool very happy that i got it not only is the um the watch
[8707.88 --> 8713.64]  great but even the box that it came in is awesome so yeah pretty cool
[8716.68 --> 8722.60]  which watch was it it's the it's the what is it chrono master watch or something like chrono mark
[8722.60 --> 8732.92]  watch from the starfield special edition in an apocalypse mad max situation which lmg member is
[8732.92 --> 8740.28]  most likely to start the raider group most likely to hold on to civilized values most likely to be the cult
[8740.28 --> 8740.60]  leader
[8744.12 --> 8744.28]  ah
[8744.28 --> 8756.36]  lioness is the cult leader oh hell yeah easy i still want to go to the mountains linus when are
[8756.36 --> 8762.04]  you going to take us to the mountains linus company town you promised to take us to gaben
[8764.28 --> 8764.76]  um
[8767.00 --> 8767.40]  ooh
[8767.40 --> 8777.00]  i could see james being a bit cult leader-y he might be my rival oh yeah i could see that
[8777.80 --> 8785.32]  uh i think i think luke don't take this the wrong way but i think that you wouldn't want to be in
[8785.32 --> 8793.56]  charge you would prefer to be the enforcer of of the of the person in power i think i think you're more
[8793.56 --> 8799.88]  of a defender than a than a like just by by nature and i feel free to correct me if i'm wrong
[8800.44 --> 8805.72]  usually how i work but i think i think you would be right hand luke regardless of who the leader is
[8805.72 --> 8813.56]  you would be putting yourself in a position hold on hold on if you felt that their leadership was a path
[8813.56 --> 8821.00]  to better order and a and a better overall situation for everyone then you would do basically anything to
[8821.00 --> 8826.44]  put yourself between them in danger that's your role yeah that's probably where i'd fit
[8830.28 --> 8839.96]  dan i imagine is more like cypher from the matrix okay continue uh you know he's you know super super
[8839.96 --> 8846.76]  technical skilled uh sells you out at a moment's notice yeah people are gonna die but we're gonna
[8846.76 --> 8860.04]  have running plumbing and indoor lighting um no i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding no no i think
[8860.04 --> 8865.24]  that's that's pretty true like people's bones as like engineering extrusion so it's just the most
[8865.24 --> 8871.16]  efficient material luke it's very it's very abundant it's very light it's very strong they come within
[8871.16 --> 8879.24]  30 feet of me and i have more more tools skin is a very effective leather um oh
[8880.76 --> 8888.60]  i uh yeah i i feel like we could talk about this for an hour but um who would hold on to civilized
[8888.60 --> 8896.04]  values i feel like yvonne would be a huge pusher for civilized values organization and civilized
[8896.04 --> 8900.60]  values but i think at a point she would accept that we have to do what it takes to get things done
[8902.68 --> 8904.76]  so who would really hold on hold on
[8904.76 --> 8917.72]  not colton no he'd be like i've got guns um
[8921.24 --> 8926.44]  doesn't he already live in like an apocalyptic wasteland and like yeah basically yeah
[8926.44 --> 8937.56]  uh let's go chillowack um sorry colton yeah i uh yeah i think that's about all i've got to say about
[8937.56 --> 8944.60]  that okay what else we got um i'm curious what you think the impact will be from a bunch of
[8944.60 --> 8951.64]  organizations now trying to do uh ai at scale without broad institutional knowledge about how
[8951.64 --> 8959.48]  to correctly measure results oh it's well blessed man it's it is and is going to be absolutely nuts
[8959.48 --> 8968.28]  for the next like at least five years um i think the upheaval that we saw today with sam altman getting
[8968.28 --> 8974.52]  ousted from open ai is just the the beginning of uh not not the beginning but i think is just
[8975.48 --> 8981.32]  a small fraction of the kind of infighting and chaos that we're going to see in this space it's a land
[8981.32 --> 8986.84]  grab right now right there's there's no rules at the end of the day um and i think yeah it's going
[8986.84 --> 8992.28]  to be a wild time man super super wild because people can't even agree on the basics of whether
[8992.28 --> 9000.20]  we should build ai or not right now how can you expect consensus and everybody marching in the same
[9000.20 --> 9007.48]  direction when we don't even know if we should march speaking of which uh nine minutes ago there was
[9007.48 --> 9015.80]  a post from greg brockman um sam as in sam altman sam and i are shocked and saddened by what the board
[9015.80 --> 9022.44]  did today let us first thank uh say thank you to the incredible people who have worked with at open ai
[9022.44 --> 9027.08]  our customers our investors and all of those who've reached out we we too are still trying to figure out
[9027.08 --> 9034.04]  exactly what happened here is what we know last night sam got a text from ilia asking to talk at noon
[9034.04 --> 9040.20]  friday sam joined a google meet uh and the whole board except greg who i think he's talking about
[9040.20 --> 9045.40]  himself in third person because i believe greg brockman was on the board um so the whole board
[9045.40 --> 9054.52]  except greg uh was told that he was being um he was being removed sorry hold on i i moved my thing and
[9054.52 --> 9059.56]  got lost the whole board except for greg was there ilia told sam he was being fired and that the news was
[9059.56 --> 9067.88]  going out very soon at 12 19 p.m greg got a text from ilia asking for a quick call at 12 23 p.m
[9067.88 --> 9073.40]  ilia sent a google meet link greg was told he was being removed from the board but that he was vital to
[9073.40 --> 9079.96]  the company and would retain his role and that sam had been fired around this time open ai published a blog post
[9080.68 --> 9086.76]  as far as we know the management team was made aware of this shortly after other than mira who found out the night prior
[9086.76 --> 9099.48]  wow so this whoa yeah quick fast and then greg immediately quit um so yeah removed from the board
[9099.48 --> 9104.28]  told he should stay and then immediately left wow
[9107.64 --> 9113.72]  it's uh it's a bit of a confusing thing i mean do we know kind of what's happened or is it all speculation
[9113.72 --> 9119.88]  at the moment well that's from the horse's mouth but that's about it yeah yeah yeah they they are
[9119.88 --> 9126.52]  literally currently trying to figure out what's going on terrifying i i i know there's been some
[9126.52 --> 9134.76]  open ai people tweeting about how it feels like a coup stuff like that um yeah i don't know
[9134.76 --> 9145.24]  okay then uh hey dll any updates on the ltt backpack zipper pulls uh yeah we're still we're still
[9145.24 --> 9150.84]  working on it we've had some challenges with the supplier i might as well just give you guys the
[9150.84 --> 9162.36]  update um they have completed part of the production process across the entire like 160 000 unit order or
[9162.36 --> 9168.20]  whatever whatever it is and they want more payment but what we had agreed to was that they would
[9168.20 --> 9173.80]  take parts of it fully to completion and then we would give them more and then they would fully
[9173.80 --> 9178.92]  complete and fully complete and we would pay in installments that way and so we are pretty upset
[9178.92 --> 9184.68]  about the current situation because they are demanding more money and they haven't actually
[9184.68 --> 9192.36]  delivered anything yet which was the deal um so i i just found this out recently that that's where
[9192.36 --> 9197.72]  it's kind of stalled at right now and we are doing our absolute best to get it moving forward as quickly
[9197.72 --> 9210.12]  as we can will the black friday deals ship in time for christmas uh oh i don't see why not i mean well i
[9210.12 --> 9215.80]  guess it depends what kind of a like insane black friday we have i've seen some of the deals that
[9215.80 --> 9228.60]  those guys are planning but uh but uh hmm yes probably almost certainly like how yeah like today's going
[9228.60 --> 9236.36]  pretty nuts with all the stuff that we launched during the show uh the rg broken wow okay can you guys like
[9236.36 --> 9240.52]  add some other stuff to your order with the arg broken t-shirt we're not making money on that you
[9240.52 --> 9251.08]  guys geez it's out selling anything else on the store by like it's 10 to one yeah the next the next
[9251.08 --> 9258.12]  most sellingest item has moved one tenth as many units come on throw a water bottle in your order
[9258.12 --> 9263.56]  you're killing me here sorry what'd you say i don't know if you can buy a shirt that cheap like almost
[9263.56 --> 9269.96]  anywhere these days oh it's a really nice shirt too um yeah yeah but like that's what i'm saying get a
[9269.96 --> 9279.24]  water bottle you guys are killing me here you probably should have done like a buy something else and get
[9279.24 --> 9284.76]  this shirt for ten dollars yeah maybe if your team coded it for me it's not supported in shopify i asked
[9284.76 --> 9291.16]  that's what i wanted to do nick came in right before the show and was like yeah we can't do that
[9291.16 --> 9303.00]  you we could do we could do buy this get a deal on another this but we can't do buy this get x price
[9303.00 --> 9311.72]  on this or buy anything get price on this because that's what i wanted to do i wanted to do 9.99 with
[9311.72 --> 9319.72]  any purchase and then we couldn't do that and i was just like all right 9.99 and then you guys only order
[9319.72 --> 9325.96]  shirts pretty specific about what you can do um i know and i know there's plugins and stuff
[9327.00 --> 9334.52]  but maybe the community will just throw me a bone here and um yeah order more than just lost leader
[9334.52 --> 9341.80]  shirts you guys are gonna you guys are gonna lose your lost leader privileges for black friday at this
[9343.56 --> 9347.48]  yeah conrad just said i just checked we can definitely do that i'm a little confused i thought
[9347.48 --> 9352.76]  we've literally done this before okay maybe it was a miscommunication then again back to what i was
[9352.76 --> 9358.36]  saying earlier about how the bigger an organization gets the more stages of telephone happen because
[9358.36 --> 9363.48]  it's possible that maybe i miscommunicated exactly the promo i wanted to run it's possible the creator
[9363.48 --> 9368.04]  warehouse team miscommunicated to the development team it's possible the development team miscommunicated
[9368.04 --> 9374.52]  to luke just now or like probably not but my point is that these breakdowns can happen anywhere in the
[9374.52 --> 9379.24]  chain and i'm sure we'll get it sorted out maybe in time for black friday yeah something will happen
[9380.44 --> 9387.48]  hey lld cod modern warfare 3 launch has me reminiscing about the glory days of online gaming
[9387.48 --> 9393.72]  one of the big staples in online gaming in the earlier 2010s halo 3 cod gta 5 uh what did you enjoy
[9393.72 --> 9399.96]  playing the most i missed that era of gaming because i had small children but luke feel free to talk about it
[9399.96 --> 9409.64]  uh so i heard gta 5 what what else was listed there halo 3 call of duty etc yeah i've not heard of that
[9409.64 --> 9415.88]  i i was much halo 3 was a great game i was much more of a halo 2 fan than a halo 3 fan um
[9418.44 --> 9426.04]  modern warfare uh i don't know i feel like because gta 5 was listed i feel like that was actually pretty
[9426.04 --> 9434.04]  close to the beginning of ltd so i actually wasn't gaming as much as like almost any other time in my life
[9434.04 --> 9443.08]  um and most of what i was doing at that time i'm gonna curveball the heck out of you but i was playing mario kart on wii u
[9443.64 --> 9445.40]  um so what up
[9447.40 --> 9448.28]  what a nerd
[9448.28 --> 9456.68]  it was really fun what a poser myself and the other four people that had we use had a great time
[9462.20 --> 9466.28]  that's all i've got for curated let's go through some potentials then i guess unless you're answering any
[9466.28 --> 9477.64]  no yes no hey wan.dll miss the red and blue hexagon set what video ideas for ltd took the
[9477.64 --> 9482.92]  least time to make in the last two years and how did they come how did they perform compared to other
[9482.92 --> 9487.80]  videos that took more time honestly i i wouldn't be able to remember exactly which ones took the least
[9487.80 --> 9495.80]  amount of time but what i will tell you is that you would be surprised i think at which videos
[9496.36 --> 9502.28]  took a lot of time and which videos were sharted out in an afternoon um
[9504.76 --> 9511.00]  like sometimes we will put a ton of work into something and get a really poor response to it
[9511.00 --> 9516.84]  and then in other cases we'll basically just throw something together and you guys absolutely love it
[9516.84 --> 9525.48]  um i'm scrolling through right now trying to find examples of this it's really um
[9525.48 --> 9533.64]  um what was the question again ones ones we threw together like fast ones like the easiest and
[9533.64 --> 9538.28]  quickest turnaround for the best performance like basically the um effort to performance ratio of
[9538.28 --> 9544.36]  your videos oh interesting okay okay like here's one that was super high effort the sponsor secret
[9544.36 --> 9549.16]  shopping that was not ultimately very well received for some legit reasons and for some that i think
[9549.16 --> 9559.08]  were just sort of um less legit uh these are always super quick uh oh actually this one was less so
[9559.08 --> 9564.76]  because we had to actually get no uh people with notoriety to send us their setups in many cases
[9564.76 --> 9569.24]  so there was a fair bit of digging and prep that went into this particular one but when we just asked
[9569.24 --> 9575.40]  the community to tweet us stuff that's relatively easy um man we put we put a fair bit of prep
[9575.40 --> 9581.16]  even into our low effort stuff these days like this we shot in a couple of hours the trying pirate game
[9581.16 --> 9586.12]  consoles from aliexpress but like ploof put a bunch of work into finding good ones getting them ordered
[9586.12 --> 9589.32]  getting them set up so that you know it was all ready for a smooth production
[9589.32 --> 9596.12]  um this is relatively easy when we just buy something really cheap and crappy because
[9596.68 --> 9601.72]  no one's expecting it to be good anyway so you know hey if it is then surprise but we'll figure that
[9601.72 --> 9607.48]  out pretty quickly and then if it's not good then we just dunk on it for 23 minutes or whatever right
[9607.48 --> 9609.40]  so that's that's pretty easy
[9609.40 --> 9621.00]  yeah nothing is that easy anymore event coverage is pretty fast turnaround but that's out of necessity
[9621.00 --> 9627.56]  not because we want to to do the whole thing in like 14 hours or whatever it's it's really challenging
[9627.56 --> 9633.48]  in its own ways man this was a freaking ton of work build your own mechanical keyboard the right way and
[9633.48 --> 9642.68]  it's now starting to get some legs but it started out really slow updates just like hey i'm just
[9642.68 --> 9649.24]  telling you guys a thing those are pretty low effort but they're high effort in terms of that you have to
[9649.24 --> 9652.20]  think about and find you know something to tell you all about
[9655.00 --> 9660.60]  this was fun man we make a lot of cool videos this one i was so disappointed that this one didn't
[9660.60 --> 9666.12]  perform better these are hilarious bad sports team tech you know this would be such a great stream
[9666.12 --> 9672.28]  format just going through and doing like a watch together um but like making you guys all click on
[9672.28 --> 9676.12]  it at the same time i've actually thought about this a lot of times like could i game the algorithm
[9676.12 --> 9681.40]  a little bit if i had 3 000 people watching alongside me i'm like okay let's all click it right now
[9681.40 --> 9685.00]  okay we're watching and i'm going to do director's commentary in your one ear while you listen to the
[9685.00 --> 9689.88]  video in the other ear and uh so like these old videos would get this boost and would they get
[9689.88 --> 9695.00]  like an algorithmic boost i want to try it at some point i had not talked about it publicly because
[9695.00 --> 9699.32]  i was like oh my devious plan but i don't know maybe somebody's done that before anyway like a
[9699.32 --> 9704.44]  like a watch together thing hi dll with the release of the new version of the steam deck have you
[9704.44 --> 9709.32]  considered going back to valve instead of staying with the rog ally what are your favorite parts of
[9709.32 --> 9715.80]  each the screen and steam deck screen and with the ally it's all about the performance but yes i am
[9715.80 --> 9725.16]  seriously uh my next game that i play is going to be octopath traveler and i am seriously considering
[9726.92 --> 9732.28]  ditching the ally and going with the steam deck oled the screen is just so good and the battery life is
[9732.28 --> 9741.32]  very enticing i was in at i was at an it con last week and learned about wasm from a dev and i was
[9741.32 --> 9745.72]  chatting with are you familiar with it and if so what are your thoughts on its potential for the
[9745.72 --> 9752.44]  development on both x86 and arm you know about wasm mr luke
[9756.84 --> 9762.60]  all right no if you can hear web web assembly oh he's yeah he's gone no he's just turned the screen
[9762.60 --> 9769.00]  off oh okay he's still here uh he's just ignoring us i have nothing to contribute to that so i guess we
[9769.00 --> 9774.36]  might have to move on there's luke wasm luke web assembly are we lagging super hard can you guys
[9774.36 --> 9781.24]  hear me yes web assembly yeah what about what web is good yes no bad uh are you familiar with it what
[9781.24 --> 9787.56]  are your thoughts on its potential i'm familiar using i haven't used it personally uh i've i've heard
[9787.56 --> 9793.00]  good things it's pretty far away from uh what we're gonna do so
[9793.00 --> 9803.72]  yeah but it's cool hey lld a question for linus how would you feel about doing a top gear style
[9803.72 --> 9808.28]  video you have stated previously that there are some video ideas that get shelved because the
[9808.28 --> 9814.60]  video would be too short uh i don't know that top gear stuff is too short uh i would definitely be down
[9814.60 --> 9819.72]  to do you know bigger grander projects but i gotta be honest with you guys it's not really the way we're
[9819.72 --> 9826.44]  built you know that's how someone like a mark rober runs things it's like every every video is is like
[9828.12 --> 9835.16]  going for the grand slam right um whereas we're more of like hey let's figure out how to consistently
[9835.16 --> 9841.72]  hit line drive singles um and if we if we can occasionally knock it out of the park then that's
[9841.72 --> 9850.12]  that's great um but we're we're more about more videos more frequently um giving you your you know
[9850.12 --> 9858.68]  your daily dose of tech and less about you know spending a month polishing one killer concept video
[9858.68 --> 9863.00]  and then trying to get 25 35 50 million views on it it's just it's a different approach
[9864.60 --> 9870.60]  i pulled the plunger on a very large sorry i'm i'm lagging like can you guys hear me we know luke
[9870.60 --> 9876.52]  hello but we love you anyway okay sorry my side's having some troubles right now but i i misspoke
[9876.52 --> 9882.28]  apparently we do use some web assembly that's my bad okay all good uh yeah we can still hear you okay
[9882.28 --> 9890.04]  but we do seem to be losing your video a little bit um okay i pulled the plunger on a very large
[9890.04 --> 9896.84]  mentor's office chair right as he was falling asleep we both laughed way too hard what is the simple
[9896.84 --> 9901.64]  plan what is a simple prank that y'all have done that resulted in lots of laughter
[9903.64 --> 9910.52]  one of my favorites was the time i rigged up a squirt gun i like taped it to the wall and then i set up a
[9910.52 --> 9915.96]  trip wire so that when my sister opened up the door it would pull on the trigger and from plaster it's
[9915.96 --> 9925.88]  pretty funny that's pretty good hey i also just love sneaking up on yvonne it's just really funny
[9928.60 --> 9934.44]  jumps i i i have a video on channel super fun of screen melter that was my favorite thing i ever did
[9934.44 --> 9943.24]  it's evil it's evil it's evil man hey lld it's not that evil it's coded in that you can press escape
[9943.24 --> 9948.36]  now i have a version where that's not the case but i didn't get anyone with ah
[9950.52 --> 9956.44]  hey lld linus since you like final fantasy 6 are there any other jrpgs you enjoy
[9956.44 --> 9964.20]  uh personally i'm not a fan of jrpgs but i absolutely love grandia yet it seems hardly
[9964.20 --> 9969.24]  anyone knows it uh one of my favorites i mean i i played through chained echoes recently i played
[9969.24 --> 9974.52]  through uh sea of stars recently uh chained echoes was definitely my favorite of the two even if the
[9974.52 --> 9980.68]  story got a little bit off the rails and i i don't want to i don't want to spoil anything so plug your
[9980.68 --> 9985.80]  ears for the next 10 seconds if you were planning to play chained echoes it's a pretty mild spoiler but
[9985.80 --> 9993.72]  basically just like every other every other cut scene there's like but then they were betrayed
[9994.76 --> 10004.44]  but then okay this is this starts to lose its impact after a while um not not quite exactly that but
[10004.44 --> 10012.92]  it's just that kind of plot twist okay it's safe to come back um so i found that kind of frustrating but
[10012.92 --> 10022.04]  i think my favorite one in terms of the best balance of gameplay story uh design um character
[10022.04 --> 10028.12]  development i i loved crosscode uh radical fish is working on something new i will pre-order it even
[10028.12 --> 10032.84]  though i always say don't pre-order i just i just love that game so much that i will just give them
[10032.84 --> 10038.44]  more money i don't really care um and it's it's such a good game it's it's just so worth it
[10038.44 --> 10047.56]  good day dll given the black market for airline parts is a thing has there and it has been for a
[10047.56 --> 10052.60]  while how about a right to repair for airline parts i bet the official parts cost as much as
[10052.60 --> 10056.92]  the airlines can bear well that's a whole thing though with certification in fact there was a big
[10056.92 --> 10062.12]  thing recently where uh there were like fraudulent certifications on a bunch of airline parts and
[10062.12 --> 10066.52]  they're in the process of tracking down where the heck all these things ended up that that's happening
[10066.52 --> 10075.40]  like right now i think when it comes to airplane parts um things get a little bit more complicated
[10075.40 --> 10085.40]  no i don't actually want joe technician repairing the jesus nut on a helicopter um i want certifications um
[10086.36 --> 10090.28]  i don't know if that's actually what it's called that's just what neighbor steve used to call it
[10090.28 --> 10095.80]  because if there's anything wrong with it you better pray to jesus was what he how he explained it to me
[10097.08 --> 10098.92]  i'm gonna see if that's just a steve thing
[10101.88 --> 10108.04]  i did hear him call it that yes it's a slang term for the main rotor retaining nut or mast nut that holds
[10108.04 --> 10116.68]  the main rotor to the mast of some helicopters you know you know why it's called the jesus nut um
[10116.68 --> 10123.40]  um is it not what i just said uh probably
[10126.76 --> 10129.16]  by the way dan didn't have the brain cells for it
[10129.88 --> 10138.12]  by the way i love this not to be confused with jesus freak which isn't a jesus enthusiast
[10138.12 --> 10145.48]  oh no okay um
[10149.40 --> 10155.96]  okay sorry does it explain why it's called that as a slang term um yeah because if it fails you better
[10155.96 --> 10162.52]  pray to jesus yeah yeah yeah we we did cover that down sorry i'm i i can't keep up with the merch
[10162.52 --> 10168.76]  messages right now do you know what you're doing great i'm trying really hard i'm sorry uh hey dll
[10168.76 --> 10175.72]  and cardboard l uh long time viewer first time buyer it's only a money reason or a marketing reason
[10175.72 --> 10185.88]  to not have a desktop version of an i3 1220p for where it has more e cores than p cores okay i had not
[10186.44 --> 10191.16]  looked this is again something that i'm really excited for the lab to be able to help us do is like
[10191.16 --> 10197.40]  dig through these deep product stacks aside from the you know the ones that get seated to press and
[10197.40 --> 10202.04]  find these diamonds in the rough this thing looks really interesting it's got two p cores and then
[10202.04 --> 10208.92]  it's i forget i looked at it a second ago but it's either six or eight e cores so for certain types of
[10208.92 --> 10216.28]  games it might actually be kind of killer like kind of a great value if you don't need more than two
[10216.28 --> 10223.88]  performance cores um you know single player games older triple a um i don't know man i uh it's it
[10223.88 --> 10231.40]  seems super cool but it also definitely is going to have many applications today where it underperforms
[10231.40 --> 10235.88]  and i think that's probably why you don't see many configurations like that back to your question
[10238.04 --> 10243.80]  hey i see there was a debate between asus ally and steam deck i understand it used to be about the
[10243.80 --> 10250.52]  price difference but is that even a valued argument or is there a huge difference in hardware there's
[10250.52 --> 10256.60]  huge differences in hardware now not just hardware the software they are they are as different as i
[10256.60 --> 10263.56]  think two devices could be while existing in the exact same category if you kind of get what i mean
[10263.56 --> 10269.48]  it's like they are to me what a uh you know a sports car and a pickup truck are like they're just
[10269.48 --> 10278.04]  sure they both roll on four wheels but they are nothing alike um you know the steam deck it's linux
[10278.04 --> 10284.28]  it's a console it's a very console appliance like experience instant sleep instant wake um all that
[10284.28 --> 10291.56]  kind of stuff right it's got the trackpad so you can play mouse games if you really want to on it
[10291.56 --> 10298.44]  it has now the far better screen but it comes with limitations like the fact that it can only run
[10299.00 --> 10303.32]  linux software or at least software that can run on a compatibility layer it's going to struggle with
[10303.32 --> 10310.12]  some anti-cheat um whereas the rog ally is going to have like a jankier interface overall i mean they've
[10310.12 --> 10316.76]  done a pretty okay job of fixing it up but it's still windows it's freaking windows right um it's more
[10316.76 --> 10321.56]  powerful but it doesn't have as good of a screen but also the screen is higher resolution actually and
[10321.56 --> 10328.12]  and and now that they're priced so similarly i saw some black friday deals that are going up
[10328.12 --> 10335.40]  already on the ally i i'm looking at it going like man you just gotta you gotta research you gotta read
[10335.40 --> 10339.96]  you gotta look you gotta figure out what's important to you and and and and go for it because steam deck
[10339.96 --> 10346.44]  has better battery life but the but the ally is more compact like i like carrying the ally better
[10346.44 --> 10351.96]  than the steam deck it's really bulky right it's really tough it's a tough answer
[10351.96 --> 10362.28]  hey dll i have the original 512 uh sorry i think that's one's already been done um let's see hello
[10362.28 --> 10368.36]  lld first are you considering reviewing handheld docs and accessories for the rog ally or steam deck
[10368.36 --> 10372.68]  there are so many but it's hard to know what's actually good i think that's something that we could
[10372.68 --> 10376.52]  do a better job of on short circuit it's not the kind of thing that we would do on ltt but um
[10376.52 --> 10381.64]  um we i talked to i talked to bell today he's the channel manager for that and we were just kind of
[10381.64 --> 10387.88]  chatting about like what can we do to improve our product mix over there and try and um find things
[10387.88 --> 10392.60]  that are more pertinent to people's interest because viewership's been like per video viewership's been
[10392.60 --> 10396.68]  down a little bit over the last while um so yeah that's that's a really good idea and maybe something
[10396.68 --> 10400.12]  that i'll flag for him i don't know that you'll see a bunch of doc reviews all of a sudden but it's
[10400.12 --> 10405.32]  definitely something that's going to be on our radar evening gentlemen what is linus's grievance against
[10405.32 --> 10409.48]  star trek i remember edsel mentioning linus didn't like it when they moved into the editing
[10409.48 --> 10411.00]  den during moving the vlog
[10414.36 --> 10422.20]  star trek uh you know what i that was a long time ago was that pre-reboot because i loved the reboot
[10422.20 --> 10427.32]  and i liked watching next generation with my dad when i was a kid but i found it pretty boring compared
[10427.32 --> 10432.68]  to lightsabers and blasters there's a lot of politics in star trek that is not that interesting to a
[10432.68 --> 10440.28]  kid but as an adult i actually well part of it is that star wars has gotten a lot worse um as an as
[10440.28 --> 10445.08]  an adult i i have no problem with star trek whatsoever i just didn't get into it as a kid so i think you're
[10445.08 --> 10447.80]  just not seeing the um nostalgia glasses
[10447.80 --> 10449.82]  Nostalgia glasses.
[10452.50 --> 10456.72]  With AI coding assistants expected to bring programming to the masses,
[10457.14 --> 10460.82]  how likely do you think it is that we'll see a world where users can tailor
[10460.82 --> 10463.12]  most websites extensively to their liking?
[10467.32 --> 10467.84]  Hmm.
[10468.26 --> 10468.78]  No.
[10470.72 --> 10471.40]  All right.
[10471.44 --> 10471.66]  Nope.
[10471.96 --> 10472.44]  Thanks, Luke.
[10473.00 --> 10475.16]  I don't think that's going to be a thing pretty much at all,
[10475.16 --> 10478.86]  because for better or worse,
[10478.96 --> 10483.88]  we're in like a very corporate stage of the internet and corporations want
[10483.88 --> 10484.32]  control.
[10485.40 --> 10487.48]  So, yeah.
[10488.14 --> 10489.22]  Question for Luke.
[10489.50 --> 10491.64]  Do you think we'll ever Branham?
[10492.14 --> 10494.36]  Do you think you'll ever Branham off of?
[10494.36 --> 10494.40]  Branch.
[10495.14 --> 10495.74]  Okay.
[10496.18 --> 10496.72]  Thank you.
[10497.10 --> 10501.00]  Do you think you'll ever branch off of LTT and make a car-related channel?
[10503.08 --> 10503.64]  No.
[10503.64 --> 10504.08]  Wow.
[10504.08 --> 10504.44]  Wow.
[10504.48 --> 10505.80]  That's a far-fetched one.
[10507.60 --> 10508.04]  Yeah.
[10508.34 --> 10508.66]  No.
[10509.08 --> 10510.02]  No, no, no, no, no.
[10510.02 --> 10517.84]  I think you're massively overextending both, not just my interest,
[10517.96 --> 10522.08]  but my knowledge and ability in that realm pretty extensively.
[10522.58 --> 10524.60]  I think drifting is real cool,
[10524.84 --> 10528.12]  and I had an opportunity to do something real cool in Japan,
[10528.12 --> 10531.42]  and cars are neat.
[10531.56 --> 10535.90]  I think there's a very surprising amount of crossover between people that are
[10535.90 --> 10537.60]  into cars and people that are into computers.
[10538.94 --> 10541.18]  I think it's something people don't think about all that often,
[10541.18 --> 10547.70]  but I've been recognized a ton at this random drifting event,
[10548.00 --> 10554.22]  because I think just curious people that like tinkering with things and messing with things
[10554.22 --> 10556.02]  and getting them to work in the way that they like,
[10556.50 --> 10561.80]  I think there's a ton of crossover with that type of people when it comes to, again,
[10561.92 --> 10562.98]  both cars and computers.
[10562.98 --> 10568.46]  So I think cars are interesting for the same reasons that I generally think computers are interesting,
[10568.46 --> 10572.44]  but they're not my main thing, and it would never be my main thing.
[10572.80 --> 10574.14]  So, yeah.
[10574.68 --> 10575.56]  There you go.
[10575.76 --> 10576.94]  One car channel.
[10579.56 --> 10580.08]  Yeah.
[10581.38 --> 10583.28]  My old Acura.
[10584.18 --> 10587.24]  Here's all the reasons why I feel like I don't want to buy a new car.
[10588.04 --> 10588.98]  That might be kind of fun.
[10588.98 --> 10595.10]  What was that story of the kid that they filmed all through his entire life?
[10596.18 --> 10596.52]  I don't know.
[10596.88 --> 10597.40]  Truman Show?
[10597.76 --> 10598.16]  No.
[10600.08 --> 10600.68]  Yeah, whatever.
[10601.16 --> 10602.08]  But about a car.
[10602.60 --> 10604.22]  Just until it dies forever.
[10605.34 --> 10605.62]  Let's see.
[10605.68 --> 10606.52]  What else we got?
[10607.08 --> 10608.42]  How about another one for Luke?
[10609.40 --> 10614.24]  We're learning about design principles in computer science, such as solid.
[10614.92 --> 10616.90]  Does Floatplane use any of these principles?
[10616.90 --> 10620.42]  If so, is it as helpful as the textbooks say they are?
[10631.00 --> 10633.14]  You should take...
[10633.14 --> 10634.76]  So, like, officially...
[10634.76 --> 10635.52]  No, not really.
[10635.80 --> 10638.82]  But you should keep those things in mind.
[10639.12 --> 10641.06]  You should take that type of approach with things.
[10641.06 --> 10645.62]  A fairly interesting one to me is NASA's.
[10645.88 --> 10647.82]  I know pretty much any excuse to bring up NASA.
[10648.06 --> 10650.38]  But it's an interesting problem.
[10650.76 --> 10655.98]  You take software development and you put it in a situation where updating it is going
[10655.98 --> 10657.02]  to be very difficult.
[10657.88 --> 10659.60]  Failures are going to be extremely critical.
[10659.60 --> 10666.56]  And there's going to be a very extreme environment that it has to run in regarding, like, radiation
[10666.56 --> 10666.96]  and stuff.
[10667.02 --> 10673.82]  So, there's going to be a lot of failures that are going to happen despite your best efforts.
[10673.82 --> 10676.26]  And it has to be able to deal with all of those different things.
[10676.26 --> 10684.94]  And the way that they approach software development, considering those variables is very interesting.
[10685.40 --> 10692.22]  Now, you take the extremely hypercritical nature of software development for NASA and you compare
[10692.22 --> 10695.26]  it against a website that plays video on the internet.
[10695.26 --> 10698.10]  And they're very different things.
[10699.96 --> 10704.22]  So, like, we consider stuff.
[10705.28 --> 10709.18]  But I wouldn't say that we, like, follow anything like that.
[10713.80 --> 10714.90]  Let's see.
[10714.90 --> 10724.20]  Dan and Luke, what changes did you have to put in place to enterprise your IT infrastructure
[10724.20 --> 10728.32]  for the company after years of not having a person whose job it was to manage it?
[10731.64 --> 10733.18]  Well, we're still doing that.
[10733.62 --> 10737.70]  One of the things that we've been doing is going through and just finding all of the stuff
[10737.70 --> 10741.06]  that really should not exist in the way that it currently does.
[10741.06 --> 10749.06]  I think saying enterprising is a little far from where we're currently at.
[10752.06 --> 10754.64]  So, there's a lot to be done.
[10755.18 --> 10763.30]  But, like, adding remote monitoring systems to things, adding monitoring in general, monitoring
[10763.30 --> 10765.02]  and notifications and stuff in general.
[10765.14 --> 10765.36]  Redundancy.
[10766.70 --> 10768.10]  Redundancy has been a big one.
[10768.10 --> 10771.02]  And we're still, well, this is one of the reasons.
[10771.28 --> 10771.76]  That's why.
[10771.84 --> 10772.44]  Yeah, exactly.
[10772.68 --> 10774.52]  So, all of this stuff is still being worked on.
[10774.54 --> 10775.14]  It's not done.
[10775.60 --> 10777.22]  But, yeah, we're adding a lot of monitoring.
[10777.36 --> 10778.50]  We're adding a lot of redundancy.
[10779.44 --> 10786.64]  We have issues in quite a few different places where the IT budget for the company has been
[10786.64 --> 10788.52]  if we can get it for a video, that's awesome.
[10788.52 --> 10797.28]  So, in a lot of places, we'll have one of something where, at this scale, you would really want two
[10797.28 --> 10798.28]  so they can fail over.
[10798.40 --> 10804.14]  So, if that thing goes down or if that thing even needs to be updated, everything is going
[10804.14 --> 10804.90]  to go down.
[10805.66 --> 10811.40]  So, adding redundancies to those situations, adding monitoring and notification support
[10811.40 --> 10815.50]  so we can tell when things go down more easily, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, has been good.
[10815.50 --> 10819.48]  Things have been improving, but it's slow and it's going to continue to be slow.
[10821.16 --> 10823.62]  We, ladies and gentlemen, we got them.
[10825.90 --> 10826.98]  Nick messaged me.
[10827.08 --> 10829.04]  He's like, yep, that was on me.
[10829.36 --> 10834.22]  I was so focused on trying to do it automatically when you add to cart that I forgot we could
[10834.22 --> 10835.34]  do it via discount code.
[10836.42 --> 10837.06]  End of Friday brain.
[10837.24 --> 10841.34]  Oh, we took his brain cell.
[10842.42 --> 10843.00]  That's what happened.
[10843.00 --> 10844.18]  We stole Nick's brain cell.
[10844.64 --> 10844.82]  Yeah.
[10844.82 --> 10846.86]  Wait, did I tell you I finished Titanfall?
[10848.62 --> 10848.98]  No.
[10849.38 --> 10849.66]  What?
[10850.00 --> 10850.32]  When?
[10851.28 --> 10851.90]  I don't know.
[10852.30 --> 10852.78]  I don't remember.
[10853.28 --> 10853.90]  What do you think?
[10854.26 --> 10854.90]  What are your thoughts?
[10855.26 --> 10855.78]  It was really good.
[10855.88 --> 10860.20]  I don't know what you're talking about that happens after the time mechanism thing that's
[10860.20 --> 10860.46]  better.
[10860.64 --> 10862.74]  I actually thought that that was the highlight of the game.
[10864.00 --> 10865.16]  Oh, did I say it was better?
[10865.36 --> 10866.22]  I don't think it was better.
[10866.22 --> 10867.48]  You said it was almost as good.
[10867.54 --> 10868.96]  I don't think anything else was even close.
[10869.02 --> 10869.86]  It was kind of samey.
[10869.86 --> 10874.54]  It had a typical kind of FPS climax, I felt.
[10876.24 --> 10876.84]  Yeah.
[10877.10 --> 10877.94]  I don't know.
[10878.08 --> 10880.48]  Almost as good might be an exaggeration as well.
[10880.62 --> 10881.68]  I liked it a lot.
[10882.64 --> 10887.12]  The absolute peak of the game is the time shifting for sure.
[10887.12 --> 10887.36]  Yeah.
[10887.48 --> 10887.60]  Okay.
[10887.84 --> 10893.18]  But I guess especially on like the hardest difficulty, the ending portion where you get
[10893.18 --> 10893.88]  the auto pistol.
[10895.22 --> 10895.88]  Is hard?
[10896.32 --> 10898.54]  You said you weren't wall running much.
[10898.96 --> 10899.18]  Yeah.
[10899.22 --> 10899.72]  I wall ran.
[10901.36 --> 10901.80]  Okay.
[10901.92 --> 10904.30]  I mean, I didn't try to wall run the whole level though.
[10904.42 --> 10904.60]  Yeah.
[10904.66 --> 10904.88]  Okay.
[10904.96 --> 10905.20]  Okay.
[10905.20 --> 10905.48]  Okay.
[10905.86 --> 10906.12]  Yeah.
[10906.32 --> 10910.28]  When you get the auto aiming, the smart, oh, not auto pistol, the smart pistol.
[10910.34 --> 10910.50]  Yeah.
[10910.62 --> 10915.50]  When you get the smart pistol, you can, you can like wall run the whole rest of the game
[10915.50 --> 10916.04]  basically.
[10916.90 --> 10917.30]  Okay.
[10917.48 --> 10917.80]  All right.
[10917.80 --> 10918.90]  I can see how that would be fun.
[10919.62 --> 10920.98]  And it's, it's very fun.
[10921.68 --> 10925.98]  Because you get to focus really hard on the wall running because the pistol is just going
[10925.98 --> 10926.76]  to shoot for you.
[10928.08 --> 10929.22]  And it, yeah, it was pretty.
[10929.96 --> 10932.56]  It's not as good as the time shifting watch.
[10932.56 --> 10936.36]  I think I lost the plot there a little bit then because I was still just going through
[10936.36 --> 10940.98]  the level thinking I, I, at first I thought the pistol was going to run out of ammo at
[10940.98 --> 10947.38]  some point or like, uh, like I just, like I was still, I was still, they put you in this
[10947.38 --> 10948.48]  like survival mindset.
[10948.76 --> 10953.12]  You, you have, you, you have a, you have one pistol and you can either use it on him
[10953.12 --> 10953.80]  or you can use it on you.
[10953.84 --> 10956.48]  Like I, I, I, maybe I just got the wrong vibe from it.
[10956.48 --> 10956.74]  Yeah.
[10957.40 --> 10962.46]  So what, what I got from that was like, you're, it's a race basically.
[10963.08 --> 10966.90]  You, you are, you are equipped with the, what was it called?
[10966.96 --> 10968.28]  The serve kit or whatever?
[10969.26 --> 10969.90]  The seer kit?
[10970.06 --> 10970.22]  Yeah.
[10970.84 --> 10974.92]  You're equipped with the seer kit and you have to go.
[10975.06 --> 10976.16]  And this is all you've got.
[10976.34 --> 10978.18]  And you just go, go, go, go, go.
[10978.82 --> 10983.50]  Um, and yeah, I, I found that part very fun, but yeah, I'm happy you liked it.
[10983.54 --> 10983.96]  That's cool.
[10984.16 --> 10985.22]  What are you doing next?
[10985.72 --> 10986.50]  Powers of Silicon Valley.
[10988.30 --> 10989.14]  That's the next one.
[10989.42 --> 10989.60]  Yep.
[10989.60 --> 10991.78]  Well, that's the last one.
[10992.90 --> 10994.46]  No, you said hackers as well.
[10995.00 --> 10995.84]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[10995.92 --> 10996.04]  Fine.
[10996.10 --> 10996.82]  Oh man, you gotta watch.
[10996.98 --> 10997.68]  You haven't seen hackers.
[10997.72 --> 10998.68]  I haven't seen hackers.
[10998.80 --> 10999.00]  I know.
[10999.06 --> 10999.26]  I know.
[10999.30 --> 10999.46]  I know.
[10999.54 --> 11000.86]  Why are you pushing that one out of your mind?
[11001.12 --> 11001.96]  I just, I forgot.
[11002.12 --> 11002.42]  I forgot.
[11002.58 --> 11002.78]  Okay.
[11002.78 --> 11003.00]  Okay.
[11003.04 --> 11003.30]  Okay.
[11003.44 --> 11004.90]  I think you're pushing back against it.
[11006.96 --> 11010.48]  So mad.
[11010.78 --> 11012.04]  I'm just confused.
[11012.46 --> 11013.14]  So mad.
[11013.36 --> 11014.98]  It's campy and fun.
[11015.14 --> 11015.60]  I don't know.
[11016.60 --> 11017.34]  Uh, okay.
[11017.34 --> 11017.92]  What else we got?
[11018.92 --> 11021.06]  Uh, high LLD.
[11021.24 --> 11024.52]  What has been the most surprising smash hit on lddstore.com?
[11026.40 --> 11026.84]  Ooh.
[11028.28 --> 11028.68]  Uh.
[11029.00 --> 11029.34]  Bread?
[11031.68 --> 11032.72]  Um, no.
[11033.04 --> 11034.90]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11035.06 --> 11035.66]  Not bread?
[11036.24 --> 11038.70]  I wouldn't describe that as a smash hit.
[11038.80 --> 11040.78]  I mean, we, we moved some bread.
[11041.96 --> 11044.14]  You know what would have been a good smash hit?
[11045.28 --> 11045.64]  Yeah.
[11045.86 --> 11046.42]  The lighter.
[11047.40 --> 11048.02]  A lighter.
[11048.24 --> 11048.52]  100%.
[11048.52 --> 11048.74]  Yeah.
[11049.18 --> 11049.62]  100%.
[11049.62 --> 11051.06]  That wouldn't have been a surprise though, Dan.
[11051.10 --> 11051.82]  That's not the question.
[11052.12 --> 11053.36]  Would have been a surprise to Nick.
[11053.36 --> 11056.46]  That would have been an obvious, obvious smash hit.
[11057.46 --> 11059.30]  I'm loading up four years of data.
[11059.30 --> 11063.52]  So give the, uh, give the poor Shopify servers a second here.
[11063.52 --> 11065.68]  Maybe I can deflect and go to a question for Luke.
[11065.68 --> 11066.92]  Maybe do one more in the meantime.
[11067.36 --> 11068.02]  Um, okay.
[11068.04 --> 11069.82]  So I guess this one would be for Luke.
[11069.90 --> 11070.10]  Yeah.
[11070.24 --> 11073.42]  I am a teen who really likes doing tech and programming in general.
[11073.62 --> 11080.44]  Luke, as someone who mainly is mainly a C dev, do you have any advice for a new C dev with less than years experience?
[11080.82 --> 11081.26]  Uh, thanks.
[11081.36 --> 11081.78]  I love the show.
[11081.88 --> 11082.12]  Whoa.
[11082.18 --> 11086.88]  I don't know if saying mainly a C dev would be fair because I don't know if calling me a dev would be fair.
[11087.22 --> 11088.96]  Um, it's been a long time.
[11089.12 --> 11091.44]  God, I've actually done like actual development work.
[11091.44 --> 11100.26]  Um, I really liked C and back when I was doing actual development, which at this point was a decade ago.
[11100.60 --> 11105.24]  Um, I, I think I was actually decently good, but it was a very, very long time ago.
[11105.36 --> 11106.98]  Um, and honestly, okay.
[11107.32 --> 11115.14]  By the time I was really rooted in C, it would probably be closer to 12 to like 13 years ago.
[11115.14 --> 11120.08]  Um, because I was, I was moving on to other stuff before I started working with Linus.
[11120.26 --> 11127.06]  Um, for a new C dev, I don't know at this point, things have moved.
[11128.54 --> 11131.62]  Things have moved on from when I did it.
[11131.62 --> 11135.68]  I'm sure things are very different, but, uh, there's some people already saying this in chat.
[11135.68 --> 11138.92]  And I've always said this for any type of development, just start doing stuff.
[11139.46 --> 11143.16]  Um, start trying to make stuff with, with C especially.
[11143.58 --> 11151.06]  Um, if your brain works this way, which is why you might be interested in C, um, start trying to get some like, uh, embedded circuit systems.
[11151.06 --> 11154.66]  So that you can start developing stuff that will do things in real life.
[11154.72 --> 11155.94]  That's what I really liked about it.
[11156.30 --> 11157.34]  Um, C and basic.
[11157.34 --> 11159.12]  I found very useful for that type of stuff.
[11159.62 --> 11164.00]  Um, learn your pointers and just start making things.
[11164.08 --> 11166.82]  I would start making things before studying too much.
[11167.82 --> 11175.40]  Um, cause then you'll find the stuff that you like want to learn and then you can study that so that you can get better at making things and you can keep making things.
[11176.34 --> 11176.78]  Yeah.
[11176.98 --> 11181.80]  I think that's probably the best thing is, uh, have a thing that you want to do with it.
[11181.80 --> 11188.76]  And then Google, Google the problem that you're trying to make it do, not the thing that you want it to do.
[11188.78 --> 11190.84]  You should see what you like.
[11191.14 --> 11191.54]  Yeah.
[11192.20 --> 11192.68]  Yeah.
[11194.92 --> 11195.68]  Um, okay.
[11195.76 --> 11196.08]  Shopify.
[11196.54 --> 11196.82]  Yeah.
[11196.94 --> 11199.38]  The, I would say the biggest.
[11200.74 --> 11201.26]  Hmm.
[11201.60 --> 11208.06]  No, there's a couple, uh, the short circuit, uh, long sleeve that I tried to cancel.
[11208.48 --> 11210.54]  And then we ended up selling.
[11210.54 --> 11212.84]  Oh, wait, no, this is.
[11213.52 --> 11218.26]  The long sleeve, uh, like, like a long sleeve t-shirt, whatever, whatever that is.
[11218.88 --> 11226.20]  Um, I would say the biggest surprise for me was the towel.
[11229.10 --> 11232.12]  We move thousands and thousands of towels.
[11232.80 --> 11234.20]  We don't promote them.
[11234.48 --> 11236.50]  We never talk about them.
[11236.50 --> 11247.12]  Um, I'd say out of all the products on the site, they are one of the least unique, uh, compared to other things of that nature.
[11247.88 --> 11254.16]  Um, the, the thing we did differently with the towel is the same thing that we did with our desk pads, where it's the same price, no matter what size.
[11254.16 --> 11256.56]  So obviously people really like the huge towels.
[11256.92 --> 11262.44]  So I guess they're like, they're a pretty good value in everything, but you know, so is value village, right?
[11262.46 --> 11265.02]  Like you could, you can get a towel cheaper if you really want.
[11265.02 --> 11269.74]  Um, but people buy the crap out of the towel.
[11269.98 --> 11271.72]  And I just, uh, I don't quite understand it.
[11271.74 --> 11274.10]  I keep, I keep bringing this up internally.
[11274.10 --> 11278.04]  Like, Hey guys, where's our next, when's our next towel?
[11278.48 --> 11285.04]  You know, just that thing that low key everybody needs, but, uh, we don't really have to do anything to sell it.
[11285.04 --> 11292.80]  We just source a decent towel, techify it a little and like profit, um, kitchen rags.
[11293.34 --> 11293.72]  Okay.
[11293.72 --> 11295.16]  That's just a small towel, Dan.
[11295.22 --> 11297.08]  You got to think a little bit outside the box here, man.
[11297.12 --> 11297.64]  Help me out.
[11298.58 --> 11299.66]  Garage rags.
[11300.36 --> 11300.72]  Okay.
[11300.78 --> 11301.24]  That's enough.
[11301.54 --> 11302.90]  Putting you back in the drawer now.
[11303.16 --> 11303.36]  Yeah.
[11303.44 --> 11304.72]  I own four towels.
[11304.88 --> 11306.64]  I own one of your sweater, right?
[11307.54 --> 11307.94]  Yeah.
[11308.12 --> 11309.70]  It's, it's, it's, it's great.
[11309.88 --> 11311.66]  Everybody buys multiple of the same thing.
[11312.38 --> 11313.24]  Oh, I see.
[11313.42 --> 11314.62]  That's what I'm, that's what I'm talking about.
[11314.62 --> 11321.62]  Like my, I, I have a set in my bathroom and then I have a set to be in the cupboard so that I can swap them out more often.
[11321.62 --> 11321.86]  Right.
[11322.46 --> 11329.28]  If I have three or four bathrooms in my house, you know, I'm going to have 10 of the same product and maybe, you know.
[11330.76 --> 11331.34]  All right.
[11331.40 --> 11331.88]  Fair enough.
[11331.96 --> 11332.16]  Right.
[11333.06 --> 11333.50]  All right.
[11334.16 --> 11334.42]  Okay.
[11334.42 --> 11334.78]  Let's see.
[11335.40 --> 11337.76]  Hi again, Dan and Linus and Luke.
[11337.76 --> 11342.54]  While I'm asking about rainbow things, any more pride colored computer themed merch coming?
[11342.54 --> 11342.58]  Right.
[11342.88 --> 11346.36]  More rainbow anodized limited run pins so I can actually get one this time?
[11347.46 --> 11350.64]  Oh, I, I wasn't even aware that they were gone.
[11350.64 --> 11357.72]  Um, I could, I can definitely, uh, Dan, do you actually mind, um, forwarding this one to the design team?
[11357.80 --> 11358.62]  Maybe to Sarah?
[11359.06 --> 11361.02]  And then, yeah, maybe we'll bring those back.
[11361.06 --> 11364.38]  Cause I hadn't, a lot of the pin drops are meant to be limited edition.
[11364.50 --> 11368.82]  I didn't think the keyboard ones in the various colorways were necessarily meant to be as limited.
[11369.18 --> 11371.60]  So maybe we could do those once in a while or something like that.
[11371.60 --> 11373.78]  I've had, uh, I've had some friends ask about those too.
[11373.88 --> 11374.00]  Yep.
[11374.30 --> 11375.40]  Uh, you said, uh, Sarah?
[11375.76 --> 11376.04]  Sarah.
[11376.80 --> 11377.34]  Let's see.
[11377.48 --> 11377.78]  Sarah.
[11381.78 --> 11383.36]  We're all sharing one brain cell today.
[11383.44 --> 11385.86]  You can see Luke is just completely like asleep right now.
[11386.50 --> 11389.64]  Um, I'm, I'm trying to, I'm assuming the show is ending soon.
[11389.64 --> 11392.54]  So I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get up to the circuit.
[11392.80 --> 11393.18]  Heck yeah.
[11393.62 --> 11394.00]  Walk.
[11395.68 --> 11400.92]  That, that's not going to be an option if I want to get there even remotely on time.
[11401.84 --> 11402.68]  Fast train.
[11405.36 --> 11406.24]  Uh, let's see.
[11406.44 --> 11406.62]  Okay.
[11406.68 --> 11407.50]  We've got three more.
[11407.66 --> 11408.56]  Can we make it through three more?
[11408.74 --> 11408.96]  Yes.
[11409.24 --> 11409.74]  Hi Linus.
[11409.78 --> 11414.26]  It was a ROG reboot video where you mounted a fan to a CPU cooler with these rubber mounts.
[11414.38 --> 11415.62]  They fit in between the fins.
[11415.76 --> 11416.88]  Do you know what they are called?
[11418.96 --> 11423.16]  Oh, I think those were actually included with that particular cooler.
[11423.78 --> 11425.04]  Don't quote me on that.
[11425.04 --> 11430.90]  Um, the, tell you what, if you tweet at me with the screenshot,
[11430.92 --> 11434.62]  of that, I will try to remember to look at it sometime this weekend.
[11435.52 --> 11437.38]  Not at Linus tech at Linus D.
[11437.46 --> 11437.72]  Sebastian.
[11439.82 --> 11440.56]  Atomic age.
[11440.62 --> 11442.46]  Ace and full play chat has a pretty good point.
[11442.56 --> 11444.66]  I'm kind of surprised we don't have a microfiber cloth.
[11444.66 --> 11449.68]  Uh, well, Apple beat us to the punch.
[11450.10 --> 11455.50]  If, you know, anyone's going to have an even more overpriced premium microfiber cloth, it's
[11455.50 --> 11456.04]  going to be Apple.
[11456.18 --> 11458.56]  So we've kind of figured now they stole our thunder.
[11458.86 --> 11462.02]  No, that's not actually, that's not actually why I, yeah, yeah, we should probably do it
[11462.02 --> 11462.42]  at some point.
[11462.42 --> 11471.02]  Um, hey, LLD question for Luke and Dan, what is your favorite Linus quote?
[11471.16 --> 11474.56]  Mine is, when showtime happens when a wizard decides that it arrives?
[11475.08 --> 11476.38]  March 30th, 2018.
[11477.86 --> 11479.68]  I just stole that from Lord of the Rings.
[11479.82 --> 11482.06]  I think there's got to be better Linus quotes than that.
[11482.78 --> 11485.26]  My favorite quote is comb it with a brick.
[11485.26 --> 11496.38]  I don't remember what he was trying to say, but he said, he said the words, comb it with
[11496.38 --> 11496.84]  a brick.
[11497.22 --> 11499.90]  I immediately challenged him to explain what he meant.
[11500.16 --> 11503.40]  And I don't remember his response being very coherent.
[11505.60 --> 11508.48]  That was, that was a Wanshow back in the garage.
[11508.72 --> 11509.54]  Was it Wanshow?
[11509.68 --> 11510.84]  I thought that was offline.
[11512.28 --> 11513.86]  No, I think that was Wanshow.
[11514.02 --> 11514.92]  I don't think so.
[11515.82 --> 11517.02]  Comb it with a brick.
[11517.62 --> 11521.80]  I still, to this day, have no idea what the fuck you were talking about.
[11523.48 --> 11525.98]  I don't remember anymore, so I can't, I don't know.
[11526.92 --> 11527.32]  Um.
[11530.72 --> 11531.16]  Oh.
[11532.20 --> 11533.02]  Joseph L.
[11533.16 --> 11534.80]  A really, really old Wanshow.
[11535.04 --> 11539.08]  What do you think is going on with MyQ blocking access to Home Assistant and other third-party
[11539.08 --> 11539.28]  apps?
[11539.34 --> 11540.48]  Okay, we talked about that last week.
[11540.48 --> 11548.14]  But I had meant to talk about, um, Eight Sleep being complete f***heads about access to their
[11548.14 --> 11550.78]  sleep pods, API access and stuff like that.
[11550.90 --> 11552.62]  So, um, f*** those guys.
[11552.90 --> 11554.02]  Um, yeah.
[11554.02 --> 11557.90]  Yeah, we worked with them on a sponsored thing once, but as long as they keep behaving like
[11557.90 --> 11559.58]  this, that's not going to happen again.
[11560.24 --> 11566.48]  Uh, and their excuse is they are cutting off access because they have something better in
[11566.48 --> 11566.92]  the works.
[11566.92 --> 11568.60]  And it's like, no.
[11568.60 --> 11573.26]  So, you launch the better thing and you let people work with the kind of kludgy thing
[11573.26 --> 11574.80]  for now if they want to.
[11574.86 --> 11575.90]  Put warnings in front of it.
[11575.96 --> 11576.52]  I don't care.
[11576.86 --> 11578.12]  But don't just cut it off.
[11578.18 --> 11578.74]  It's ridiculous.
[11581.68 --> 11582.58]  Sorry, that was it.
[11584.68 --> 11588.40]  Uh, you talk about always moving forward in terms of content at LMG.
[11588.58 --> 11591.52]  Are there any practices or content types on the way out?
[11591.52 --> 11601.08]  Honestly, we, we do, it's, it's less of, um, it's less of like a decision we make that,
[11601.20 --> 11602.70]  well, we're not going to do anything like that before.
[11602.80 --> 11604.10]  Oh, we're going to move in this direction.
[11604.72 --> 11607.80]  Um, you know, we, we, we often try to make those kinds of decisions.
[11607.80 --> 11611.50]  Like I remember seeing the success of Scrapyard Wars way back in the day, especially driving
[11611.50 --> 11614.80]  subscriptions to Floatplane and thinking, oh, we need to do way more serialized content.
[11614.80 --> 11616.22]  But it's not that simple.
[11616.32 --> 11621.36]  You can't decide what you, what end product you need and then just hope you have a creative
[11621.36 --> 11622.36]  spark that gets you there.
[11622.42 --> 11625.16]  That's how you end up with TV, you know?
[11625.78 --> 11630.56]  Um, so we, we like to be very seat of our pants driven.
[11631.36 --> 11635.22]  Um, but that's not always possible.
[11635.22 --> 11639.60]  So you have to have systems and so it's, it's a balancing act, right?
[11639.96 --> 11642.10]  Um, and I would say it's more of a slow evolution.
[11642.10 --> 11645.92]  One of the things that's been happening since the shutdown is the writers meeting does weekly,
[11645.92 --> 11656.06]  uh, they call them, um, post more funds because post mortem had kind of like a, you know, crappy
[11656.06 --> 11657.06]  vibe to it.
[11657.06 --> 11658.32]  So there are more funds.
[11658.58 --> 11662.52]  Um, and we basically just go through what went well this week, what went poorly.
[11662.52 --> 11666.38]  I usually don't get to attend them because they take place during WAN show at the end
[11666.38 --> 11666.88]  of the week.
[11666.98 --> 11671.52]  Um, but I, uh, because Luke was off site and because I wasn't actually shooting anything
[11671.52 --> 11676.04]  in the lead up to WAN show, I got to sit in on part of one today and it's really cool.
[11676.04 --> 11679.52]  Just kind of talking about things that went well, things that didn't go as well.
[11679.52 --> 11683.66]  And, um, you know, working together to, uh, you know, keep making better content.
[11683.66 --> 11688.86]  I mean, we definitely, uh, it's, it's no secret that we have taken a bit of a hit to viewership
[11688.86 --> 11689.76]  ever since the shutdown.
[11689.76 --> 11694.74]  I'm not going to deny that, but what I'm really proud of is the way that the team is pulling
[11694.74 --> 11701.36]  together to make the very best content that we can and how swift that recovery has been.
[11701.52 --> 11705.62]  Um, you know, if you look at, oh, obviously you guys don't have access to the same dashboard
[11705.62 --> 11706.10]  that I do.
[11706.10 --> 11710.78]  So your view is not going to be quite as granular, but once this month is over, um, you're
[11710.78 --> 11714.68]  going to see there's going to be this line and then it's going to go like this and then
[11714.68 --> 11716.46]  it's going to go, boom, boom, boom.
[11716.46 --> 11718.98]  Like we are, uh, we're, we're back, baby.
[11719.06 --> 11721.18]  I mean, the team is, um, it's incredible.
[11721.18 --> 11726.80]  I say it all the time, but world-class and, um, it's not the kind of thing that I could do
[11726.80 --> 11727.30]  by myself.
[11727.30 --> 11730.82]  So it was, it was really cool watching that creative process today.
[11730.82 --> 11736.02]  And, um, even though I've seen a lot of the results of it, you just sort of seeing how
[11736.02 --> 11738.04]  the sausage was made even internally here.
[11738.34 --> 11739.82]  Um, really neat.
[11740.60 --> 11745.66]  I have, um, I have another message from one of our world-class team members.
[11745.66 --> 11747.10]  That's from Mr. Nick Light.
[11747.46 --> 11747.72]  Oh.
[11748.22 --> 11750.46]  Microfiber shirt in chopped towel blue.
[11751.30 --> 11752.44]  Oh, that's right.
[11753.34 --> 11754.10]  That's hilarious.
[11754.22 --> 11755.00]  I forgot about that.
[11755.00 --> 11760.40]  I, uh, I wanted to do a shirt made entirely of microfiber.
[11760.70 --> 11762.32]  It's a really weird garment.
[11762.66 --> 11764.44]  I actually really like it.
[11764.92 --> 11766.10]  We have a prototype.
[11766.66 --> 11769.50]  Have you tested on an anybody with any sort of body hair?
[11769.64 --> 11770.08]  No.
[11770.34 --> 11770.74]  Uh.
[11771.14 --> 11771.74]  Oh, no, no.
[11771.74 --> 11775.84]  But it's, it's, it only has one more textured side and then it has like a, like a less textured
[11775.84 --> 11776.24]  side.
[11776.24 --> 11779.34]  So I think, I think the idea is to wear it microfiber side out.
[11779.44 --> 11780.04]  I don't remember.
[11780.14 --> 11782.04]  Now I just want to wear it microfiber side in.
[11782.12 --> 11782.30]  Yeah.
[11782.32 --> 11784.14]  You just, you just wear a microfiber shirt.
[11784.42 --> 11785.30]  Like it's hilarious.
[11785.54 --> 11785.88]  I don't know.
[11785.94 --> 11786.26]  We'll see.
[11786.48 --> 11787.36]  Maybe it'll be a failure.
[11787.48 --> 11788.48]  Maybe it'll be a sleeper hit.
[11788.64 --> 11790.62]  I'll take 20 and use them to clean my computer.
[11790.72 --> 11792.10]  Either way, Luth got somewhere to be.
[11792.32 --> 11796.82]  And, uh, I, I was going to say you guys have somewhere to be, but let's face it.
[11797.34 --> 11800.62]  You hang out with us every Friday, which we love, but, um.
[11800.62 --> 11806.08]  See you again next week.
[11806.10 --> 11806.24]  Bye.
[11806.68 --> 11807.12]  Yeah.
[11807.34 --> 11807.62]  Yeah.
[11807.62 --> 11807.66]  Yeah.
[11807.66 --> 11807.94]  That.
[11808.74 --> 11811.28]  Dan, play Linus in super check so he doesn't get sad.
[11813.34 --> 11814.36]  But he'll win.
[11815.42 --> 11815.86]  Yeah.
[11815.86 --> 11816.70]  He wins every time.
[11816.94 --> 11817.88]  I can try.
[11818.14 --> 11818.62]  Yeah, sure.
[11818.62 --> 11823.62]  I, I have to, I have to post tech link stuff, which is important.
[11825.20 --> 11826.88]  Um, we're still alive though.
[11827.10 --> 11827.22]  Yeah.
[11827.26 --> 11828.42]  Wait for the catch up.
[11828.66 --> 11829.00]  Yeah.
[11829.60 --> 11830.00]  Yeah.
[11830.62 --> 11833.42]  I guess I can run this through the morning.
