[0.00 --> 6.00]  And welcome to the WAN Show! We've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[6.00 --> 14.00]  Unity! Introduced in Stolfies. Literally everyone hated it. I mean I hated it.
[14.00 --> 15.00]  Me too. Did you hate it?
[15.00 --> 17.00]  Dan? Dan, did you hate it?
[17.00 --> 18.00]  Oh yeah.
[18.00 --> 19.00]  Hands up.
[19.00 --> 20.00]  Why is his hand not up?
[20.00 --> 21.00]  Ah, there we go.
[21.00 --> 23.00]  Oh, he's got two hands. Dan, you can't vote twice!
[23.00 --> 25.00]  I'm very, very against.
[25.00 --> 32.00]  Speaking of voting, California has passed a right to repair bill that actually looks kinda decent-ish?
[32.00 --> 34.00]  Uh, yeah. That's exciting.
[34.00 --> 35.00]  What else we got this week?
[35.00 --> 39.00]  Uh, Bungie Cheater legally barred from all Bungie games.
[39.00 --> 41.00]  How is that even possible? How do you ban-
[41.00 --> 43.00]  Did I say Bungie Cheater? Destiny 2 Cheater.
[43.00 --> 46.00]  How do you ban someone from playing your games?
[46.00 --> 49.00]  I mean, I guess, I'm sure we'll talk about it. What else we got?
[49.00 --> 55.00]  Also, I want to talk about this because it's just so freakin' cool, and I'm gonna pick the topic because he's an investor and I'm not.
[55.00 --> 57.00]  But Framework Gaming handheld.
[57.00 --> 59.00]  Oh, I know, right? Someone made their own, and it's sick!
[59.00 --> 60.00]  I know! I know!
[60.00 --> 64.00]  It's actually like one of the coolest things I've seen in a really long time, so I really want to talk about it.
[64.00 --> 65.00]  Alright, we're gonna do that then.
[65.00 --> 66.00]  Yeah.
[70.00 --> 72.00]  I don't know what's going on. It sounds like a-
[72.00 --> 73.00]  Yeah.
[77.00 --> 78.00]  Really good timing.
[78.00 --> 91.00]  It sounds like an Xbox GO palabras thatres like...
[91.00 --> 94.98]  Alright, why don't we jump right into our headline topic today.
[95.30 --> 108.40]  On Tuesday, Unity announced the Unity Runtime Fee, which will be charged to developers every time a Unity game is installed, starting in January of next year.
[108.98 --> 115.92]  The fee only applies to games that meet both the revenue and installation threshold.
[115.92 --> 121.58]  So you can check the fee schedule by clicking this link that I haven't provided to you guys, but it's definitely in my document.
[121.78 --> 123.54]  I'm sure if you Google it, you'll come up with it.
[123.54 --> 129.90]  After which, they will be charged up to 20 cents per new installation.
[130.44 --> 133.00]  Not retroactive, new installation.
[133.28 --> 139.78]  That is, I don't want to use the bleep button too early in the show, but that is somethinged up.
[140.48 --> 141.44]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[141.62 --> 145.28]  This is like the most abusable system I think I've pretty much ever heard of.
[145.92 --> 152.22]  Free games with no monetization will be exempt, but in the wake of the announcement,
[152.68 --> 157.74]  hordes of developers have pointed out that the new fees could be absolutely disastrous
[157.74 --> 163.30]  for low cost or free to play games with large player bases, but limited revenue.
[163.78 --> 167.52]  Such games could wind up owing more money than they make.
[167.98 --> 175.10]  Devs also raised the possibility that angry players could punish developers by repeatedly uninstalled.
[175.10 --> 177.96]  Oh my word.
[179.12 --> 182.20]  I thought it was per new install.
[182.82 --> 185.26]  Every single time?
[185.42 --> 185.64]  Yes.
[185.74 --> 188.02]  So I could uninstall and reinstall a game.
[188.08 --> 189.76]  So that's why I said this is going to be the most...
[189.76 --> 192.10]  What is their possible justification for this?
[192.24 --> 193.86]  They don't even pay for the bandwidth.
[194.10 --> 195.42]  And you know how gamers are, right?
[195.42 --> 198.44]  Even Valve doesn't charge for every install.
[198.58 --> 198.72]  No.
[198.80 --> 201.44]  And they're the ones actually ponying up the bandwidth.
[201.62 --> 201.82]  Yeah.
[202.18 --> 204.60]  What possible justification could...
[204.60 --> 204.94]  Oh, sorry.
[205.02 --> 206.02]  And think about how...
[206.02 --> 206.72]  Okay, no, we're not done yet.
[206.76 --> 207.68]  We need to get through the thing.
[207.76 --> 208.94]  Think about how passionate gamers are.
[208.94 --> 210.04]  No, no, we get through the thing.
[210.06 --> 210.80]  Let's get through the thing.
[210.90 --> 211.08]  Okay.
[211.08 --> 211.18]  All right.
[211.18 --> 211.38]  All right.
[211.38 --> 213.06]  I was...
[213.06 --> 213.28]  Okay.
[213.34 --> 214.26]  I was mad enough.
[214.38 --> 215.26]  And I thought this...
[215.26 --> 216.92]  I don't know what I thought it was.
[217.00 --> 218.38]  That just didn't seem possible.
[218.76 --> 219.92]  That it could be that stupid.
[220.08 --> 221.98]  I just didn't...
[223.20 --> 223.50]  Okay.
[223.70 --> 224.04]  Hold on.
[224.56 --> 226.06]  I think they've walked that back.
[226.06 --> 231.40]  Unity says this kind of abuse would be addressed by their existing fraud detection system.
[231.52 --> 232.44]  Okay, so what?
[232.84 --> 234.00]  You're going to take care of me?
[234.04 --> 237.92]  This is basically the mob telling you that, oh, don't worry.
[237.92 --> 242.92]  We're going to make sure that, you know, Johnny Two-Step doesn't collect protection money
[242.92 --> 245.04]  too many times this month.
[245.20 --> 246.60]  What are you talking about?
[246.78 --> 249.94]  Which, by the way, I don't think they ever actually give any details on how that works.
[249.96 --> 251.42]  I'm supposed to trust you?
[251.76 --> 252.00]  Yeah.
[252.00 --> 254.04]  After you just...
[254.04 --> 258.74]  Several indie game devs have announced that they will be switching to other game engines
[258.74 --> 262.54]  or pulling their games from sale as of 2021.
[263.04 --> 263.90]  Oh, sorry.
[263.98 --> 264.42]  From sale.
[264.56 --> 265.50]  This has a semicolon.
[265.94 --> 273.32]  As of 2021, Unity claimed that its game engine was used to develop approximately 50% of all games.
[274.58 --> 280.42]  Redditors discovered that Unity Technologies silently deleted a clause in their licensing agreement
[280.42 --> 285.24]  that would have exempted games released before the new fees take effect in January.
[285.76 --> 291.52]  Then, Unity deleted the GitHub repository that tracked such changes.
[292.68 --> 296.76]  This is incredibly scummy.
[296.94 --> 298.40]  This just keeps getting worse.
[298.54 --> 298.80]  Oh, yeah.
[298.96 --> 300.66]  And there's still like two more...
[300.66 --> 301.80]  Oh, goodness gracious.
[301.98 --> 304.04]  There's still four more paragraphs to read through.
[304.50 --> 306.04]  It probably gets better.
[306.04 --> 309.50]  It doesn't get better, does it?
[309.54 --> 310.38]  A little bit, actually.
[310.56 --> 310.70]  Okay.
[311.06 --> 316.62]  The likely motivation for this change is that Unity hasn't had positive revenue in any financial quarter
[316.62 --> 321.12]  over the last three years and lost nearly a billion dollars over the past four quarters.
[321.96 --> 322.82]  Oh, okay.
[323.78 --> 328.64]  Much of Unity's income comes from helping sell mobile game ads, which is typically volatile
[328.64 --> 331.42]  and has been hit heavily by recent privacy initiatives.
[331.42 --> 337.26]  There has likewise been controversy over Unity Technologies' leadership, including CEO John...
[337.26 --> 338.26]  Rick...
[338.26 --> 339.26]  Rickitello?
[340.88 --> 341.92]  I think two C's.
[342.14 --> 342.72]  Yeah, whatever.
[342.96 --> 344.56]  I'm really bad with name pronunciation.
[344.80 --> 345.18]  So, John.
[345.96 --> 351.38]  Apparently selling large amounts of Unity stock in the two weeks before the announcement of the new fees.
[351.56 --> 355.22]  So did, by the way, a lot of other key actors at the company, not just him.
[355.30 --> 355.78]  But yeah, keep going.
[355.78 --> 362.20]  Yeah, so this is a guy who, during a 2011 investor meeting, floated the idea of charging players a dollar to reload their gun.
[362.58 --> 363.70]  To be clear on that statement...
[363.70 --> 364.74]  That's probably a joke.
[365.58 --> 366.54]  Not 100%.
[366.54 --> 366.88]  Oh, no.
[366.88 --> 369.78]  But to be clear on that statement, it was, I believe...
[369.78 --> 377.48]  Yeah, it was an unofficial recording of a meeting, and he was saying, if you're like six hours into a play session,
[377.94 --> 383.38]  and you go to reload your gun, and it asks you for a dollar to pay for it,
[383.46 --> 387.62]  you are in a position where you are more likely to accept that payment.
[387.96 --> 388.56]  I see.
[388.70 --> 390.92]  Which is still hyper scummy.
[391.78 --> 392.94]  But accurate, I guess.
[392.94 --> 394.36]  But it's technically slightly different.
[394.58 --> 395.12]  I don't know.
[395.30 --> 396.36]  That's going off of memory.
[396.42 --> 397.28]  I think it's slightly different than that.
[397.28 --> 399.14]  But it's, yeah, it's...
[399.14 --> 402.54]  Since the backlash started, Unity has clarified some things.
[403.38 --> 408.24]  They expect that 90% of their customers will not be affected by these changes.
[409.36 --> 409.76]  Okay.
[411.28 --> 413.28]  Reinstalls, fraudulent installs...
[414.40 --> 416.46]  What is a fraudulent install?
[416.62 --> 416.92]  Piracy?
[416.98 --> 417.36]  I don't know.
[417.92 --> 423.24]  Trials, demos, and charity bundle installs will not be counted as a new install.
[423.34 --> 423.64]  So what?
[424.02 --> 424.28]  Is it...
[424.28 --> 428.12]  Are we going to see a fresh resurgence in Humble Bundles then?
[429.10 --> 429.54]  Because...
[429.54 --> 431.62]  Is that a charity install?
[431.80 --> 432.16]  If it could be...
[432.16 --> 433.78]  There's some amount of money going towards charity.
[433.78 --> 433.98]  Partially charity?
[434.14 --> 434.82]  I don't know.
[435.00 --> 435.14]  Yeah.
[435.90 --> 438.72]  Web and streaming games don't count.
[438.86 --> 439.04]  Okay.
[439.12 --> 441.88]  So I'm having a hard time figuring out what does count.
[441.96 --> 444.30]  So is it just on the first install?
[444.52 --> 446.14]  In which case...
[446.14 --> 446.60]  No.
[447.60 --> 449.94]  Well, if a reinstall doesn't count.
[450.26 --> 451.86]  Well, I think that was...
[452.40 --> 455.24]  If I remember correctly, this was...
[455.24 --> 455.38]  Yeah.
[455.48 --> 457.12]  So this is clarified or whatever.
[457.26 --> 460.10]  I believe it originally fully included reinstalls.
[460.56 --> 462.04]  And then they walked that back.
[462.38 --> 462.56]  Okay.
[462.56 --> 463.72]  That's why I said I think it's gotten better.
[463.78 --> 464.94]  Because I do think that has happened.
[464.98 --> 469.20]  Riley saw tweets from some developers who apparently met with Unity representatives and
[469.20 --> 470.64]  said they have a little bit of hope again.
[470.64 --> 473.04]  So we'll see what Unity has to say next week.
[473.12 --> 474.04]  But I think that...
[474.80 --> 478.62]  If we were going to put together a picture...
[478.62 --> 478.76]  Okay.
[478.88 --> 479.08]  Sorry.
[479.40 --> 480.06]  D. Hollinger.
[480.16 --> 481.98]  I think this is correct, which is why I'm calling it out.
[482.02 --> 482.98]  Because I've read this elsewhere.
[483.16 --> 485.28]  They walked back the every install language.
[485.62 --> 490.36]  But the walking back walks it back on a single device.
[491.24 --> 494.92]  So every single time you have a new device, that would count as an additional install.
[495.18 --> 498.34]  I suspect this doesn't necessarily mean new device.
[498.34 --> 501.06]  I suspect this means effectively operating system.
[502.36 --> 506.52]  Like I bet you if you have a computer and you reinstall your operating system, I bet you
[506.52 --> 507.34]  it's going to ding again.
[507.52 --> 508.44]  I don't know that.
[508.74 --> 508.86]  Yeah.
[508.92 --> 515.30]  It's hard to say because Microsoft manages to get the licensing for Windows to tie into
[515.30 --> 516.34]  the motherboard ID somehow.
[516.34 --> 518.66]  And it's definitely possible for them to do that.
[518.76 --> 518.94]  Yeah.
[519.02 --> 521.00]  It's just a matter of whether they would want to.
[521.18 --> 521.54]  Exactly.
[521.92 --> 522.10]  Yeah.
[523.32 --> 523.56]  Yeah.
[523.56 --> 532.34]  And I think the bigger question is, especially, okay, there is a big difference between doing
[532.34 --> 540.04]  something and then it being a mistake and you walking it back and, okay, you know, fine.
[540.10 --> 540.82]  That's one thing.
[542.30 --> 546.96]  And preemptively covering your tracks and then doing it.
[547.28 --> 548.16]  I also, okay.
[548.16 --> 552.60]  So yes, I think them doing this in the first place at all is super scummy.
[552.84 --> 552.94]  Right.
[553.00 --> 556.08]  But, but they preemptively covered their tracks.
[556.50 --> 561.82]  It's like, it's like if you did something and someone found it in your Chrome history
[561.82 --> 563.84]  and you're like, I didn't know I wasn't supposed to look at that.
[564.00 --> 565.00]  You kind of go, okay.
[565.92 --> 572.34]  But, but if you walk in and they're in an incognito window and you're like, okay.
[572.44 --> 574.02]  Not only were you doing it, but you were trying to hide it.
[574.68 --> 575.04]  Exactly.
[575.14 --> 575.62]  Makes it worse.
[575.62 --> 578.60]  That's, that's what I, that's exactly what I mean.
[578.64 --> 580.76]  I mean, you're, I mean, you're okay.
[581.02 --> 585.44]  I, I, I didn't think this through defense doesn't really.
[587.32 --> 588.60]  It rings kind of hollow.
[588.80 --> 588.98]  Yeah.
[589.20 --> 589.38]  Yeah.
[589.38 --> 589.54]  Yeah.
[589.54 --> 589.92]  For sure.
[590.24 --> 590.44]  Yeah.
[591.90 --> 593.86]  Was I going to say there was something.
[593.86 --> 595.34]  Someone's saying there's no excuse for this.
[595.40 --> 596.20]  Please don't even try.
[596.30 --> 597.94]  Did I say there's an excuse for this?
[597.94 --> 599.14]  Neither of us are trying to excuse it.
[599.14 --> 600.34]  Nobody said that at all.
[600.34 --> 603.80]  What I said is that trying to hide it ahead of time makes it worse.
[603.90 --> 604.62]  I didn't say that.
[604.62 --> 607.04]  It doesn't, I didn't say that it wasn't already bad.
[607.32 --> 611.58]  And what I said was that it has, the, the situation has potentially improved.
[611.72 --> 613.38]  Not that it's good now.
[613.38 --> 616.46]  Um, improve doesn't mean good to be very clear.
[617.22 --> 622.32]  Um, there's been a lot of, a lot of major pushback.
[622.32 --> 624.52]  Um, one that I thought was pretty interesting.
[624.52 --> 627.24]  It's from, uh, I, I, oh my goodness.
[627.24 --> 629.18]  I can't use Twitter properly on this computer.
[629.42 --> 630.24]  Oh, I signed in.
[630.68 --> 631.02]  Okay.
[631.22 --> 635.06]  Um, look up Slay the Spire, or I think their company name is Megacrit.
[637.12 --> 637.44]  Megacrit?
[637.62 --> 637.76]  Yeah.
[637.88 --> 638.16]  Megacrit.
[638.16 --> 639.80]  If I'd thought of it, I'd have named my company.
[639.92 --> 640.82]  That's a cool company name.
[640.92 --> 641.42]  It's pretty good.
[641.72 --> 641.90]  Yeah.
[642.04 --> 642.18]  Okay.
[642.26 --> 642.64]  Megacrit.
[642.78 --> 643.16]  Here we go.
[644.42 --> 644.76]  All right.
[644.78 --> 645.54]  What am I looking for?
[645.98 --> 649.06]  Um, they should have a tweet fairly recently.
[650.38 --> 652.04]  Uh, I got it.
[652.18 --> 652.40]  Okay.
[652.58 --> 652.80]  Okay.
[652.86 --> 653.02]  Cool.
[653.02 --> 653.76]  Oh, you've, okay.
[653.88 --> 654.04]  Sure.
[654.18 --> 654.86]  Well, you're on it.
[655.20 --> 655.52]  Yep.
[656.28 --> 656.68]  There we go.
[656.76 --> 658.04]  Oh, we can't see it all, but close.
[658.38 --> 663.24]  The Megacrit team has been hard at work these past two plus years on a new game.
[663.36 --> 667.66]  Their, their first game, as far as my understanding goes, which is Slay the Spire, just killed.
[667.96 --> 669.74]  It sold a crazy amount of copies of Amazing Game.
[670.58 --> 671.72]  Oh, there's a big swear word on the screen.
[671.78 --> 673.22]  Actually, you could use us to cover that up.
[673.66 --> 674.02]  Um.
[674.14 --> 674.62]  That's fine.
[675.12 --> 675.62]  I'm over it.
[675.82 --> 676.12]  They've been.
[676.30 --> 677.26]  It's true what they said.
[677.26 --> 680.86]  They've been at work these past two plus years on a new game.
[680.86 --> 685.30]  But unlike with Slay the Spire, the engine we have been developing it in is Unity.
[686.02 --> 691.32]  The retroactive pricing structure of runtime fees is not only harmful in a myriad of ways
[691.32 --> 693.10]  to developers, especially indies.
[693.22 --> 695.40]  It is also a violation of trust.
[695.78 --> 699.62]  We believe Unity is fully aware of this, seeing that they have gone so far as to remove their
[699.62 --> 700.52]  TOS from GitHub.
[701.00 --> 705.30]  Despite the immense amount of time and effort our team has already poured into developing
[705.30 --> 710.60]  our new title, we build me, we, we will be migrating to a new engine unless the
[710.60 --> 714.78]  changes are completely reverted and TOS protections put in place.
[714.94 --> 717.00]  We have never made a public statement before.
[717.18 --> 719.06]  That is how badly it is.
[719.06 --> 719.46]  It's up.
[722.16 --> 724.46]  Which I thought was great.
[724.54 --> 726.48]  I thought that was very well said, to be honest.
[726.60 --> 728.76]  Yeah, they leave the door open for Unity to fix this.
[728.84 --> 730.56]  Yeah, which is good.
[730.72 --> 731.30]  Which is good.
[731.48 --> 731.68]  Yeah.
[731.68 --> 734.36]  But they also make their stance on it very clear.
[734.84 --> 736.66]  And like, yeah.
[736.80 --> 742.52]  It's also like a big move to abandon two years of development.
[742.58 --> 745.30]  It's not really, because like some of it's going to be able to transfer over, but not
[745.30 --> 745.64]  everything.
[746.72 --> 747.38]  I don't know.
[747.54 --> 749.90]  Some people have made, I always forget how to pronounce it.
[750.38 --> 751.06]  How do you say it, Dan?
[752.84 --> 753.24]  What?
[753.38 --> 753.86]  Go Dot?
[754.66 --> 755.06]  Godot.
[755.42 --> 755.82]  Godot.
[756.06 --> 756.38]  Okay.
[756.84 --> 757.24]  Sure.
[757.24 --> 764.86]  Some people have made, as far as I know, Unity to Godot, like, transfer tools to help
[764.86 --> 766.52]  you migrate over, which is cool.
[768.46 --> 770.44]  I think this has got to be great for Godot.
[771.00 --> 774.34]  So just a quick correction.
[774.82 --> 779.74]  Someone in Twitch chat said that the premeditation is the difference between murder and manslaughter.
[779.96 --> 783.30]  It's actually the difference between first degree murder and second degree murder.
[784.42 --> 785.54]  Is that an American thing, though?
[785.54 --> 786.06]  I want to clarify that.
[786.06 --> 788.52]  It's definitely a Canadian and American thing.
[788.70 --> 791.12]  I don't know about elsewhere in the world.
[791.40 --> 794.78]  But here, I actually also don't know about Mexico.
[795.24 --> 800.80]  But as far as I know, Canada and the U.S., first degree murder is premeditated.
[801.32 --> 801.92]  It's planned.
[802.50 --> 804.38]  And that's really, really bad.
[805.06 --> 809.94]  Second degree murder is also really, really bad, because you definitely still intentionally
[809.94 --> 810.64]  killed someone.
[811.24 --> 813.64]  But there is some room.
[813.76 --> 815.00]  There's a difference between premeditated and not premeditated.
[815.00 --> 819.90]  There's a little bit more leniency for, you know, in particular, something like a crime
[819.90 --> 825.90]  of passion, which could take place in a time when someone is understandably in a very intense
[825.90 --> 834.00]  emotional state, such as, you know, walking in on a loved one cheating with someone or something
[834.00 --> 834.68]  like that.
[834.68 --> 844.90]  You know, there's a bit more leeway in terms of sentencing there compared to, like, you know, you've got like a whole drawn out plan.
[845.12 --> 846.54]  You've clearly been working on this for months.
[846.62 --> 848.20]  You are a cold-blooded killer.
[848.90 --> 851.50]  And then manslaughter is without the intent.
[852.44 --> 855.76]  You didn't intend, but someone's still dead.
[855.90 --> 857.18]  So you got to pay the price.
[857.40 --> 860.22]  You'll probably often see that in like automotive accidents and stuff.
[860.22 --> 861.04]  Yeah, exactly.
[861.18 --> 861.80]  That sort of thing.
[861.94 --> 871.64]  So we're talking about the difference between being a cold-blooded premeditated killer and, you know, murdering someone.
[871.96 --> 876.50]  But like, it was impulsive.
[876.82 --> 879.14]  You know, it was in the heat of the moment or something like that.
[879.34 --> 881.96]  Now, I have an interesting called it moment.
[882.06 --> 884.68]  How much should we charge them to reload their gun and kill again?
[885.68 --> 886.34]  A dollar?
[886.98 --> 888.02]  Is that the right piece?
[889.06 --> 891.06]  If you ask Chris Rock, it'd be like $5,000.
[891.68 --> 891.98]  Yeah.
[892.36 --> 892.48]  Yeah.
[892.54 --> 894.04]  Or what was the bid he did?
[894.08 --> 895.68]  How much does Chris Rock think bullets should cost?
[895.72 --> 896.04]  I forget.
[897.68 --> 898.54]  Anyway, go ahead.
[898.76 --> 898.86]  Yeah.
[899.66 --> 906.54]  We talked about John, don't fully know how to pronounce his last name, on WAN Show before.
[906.70 --> 909.08]  Because we talked about when he first got the job at Unity.
[909.24 --> 910.50]  This was a show a long time ago.
[910.56 --> 911.84]  I don't know, three years ago, whatever.
[911.84 --> 919.26]  Because at the time, and the quote about the paying to reload your gun thing was when he worked back at EA.
[919.70 --> 920.20]  Oh, of course.
[920.24 --> 920.68]  He's from EA.
[920.76 --> 921.26]  That makes sense.
[921.36 --> 921.54]  Yeah.
[921.68 --> 923.94]  So we talked about how he went from EA to Unity.
[924.10 --> 927.86]  And we talked on the show about how we thought this would be a really bad thing.
[928.12 --> 934.26]  So as much as I'm not good at it, and I just dabble as a hobby, every once in a while, I play around with game engines.
[934.26 --> 935.68]  Because I think they're just interesting.
[935.68 --> 938.40]  I used to mess around with RPG Maker when I was like 12.
[938.64 --> 941.76]  And, you know, I just still mess around every once in a while, see what I can do.
[942.80 --> 945.24]  I used to mess around in Unity.
[946.00 --> 951.18]  And when we covered that news on the show, I switched to mess around in Unreal Engine.
[951.44 --> 953.28]  Because I was like, this is going to go bad.
[953.70 --> 954.06]  I'm out.
[954.44 --> 957.04]  Not that my stake in this matters at all.
[957.08 --> 958.12]  Yeah, he'll never make a game.
[958.20 --> 958.34]  No.
[958.40 --> 958.80]  No offense.
[958.96 --> 959.42]  No, I won't.
[959.54 --> 959.90]  Yeah, I know.
[959.98 --> 960.90]  I have no intention to.
[961.02 --> 961.12]  Yeah.
[961.12 --> 962.42]  I just find it fun to mess around with.
[962.42 --> 965.40]  But, yeah.
[965.60 --> 966.38]  Like, I don't know.
[966.56 --> 968.92]  This was definitely going to go poorly.
[969.18 --> 971.34]  Now, there's been some interesting Reddit threads.
[971.64 --> 973.16]  And a lot of this is still developing.
[973.34 --> 976.80]  So I think the Wancho writers did a great job, to be very clear.
[976.80 --> 978.22]  But I don't think this is in here.
[978.26 --> 979.78]  Because I think this Reddit thread is like super new.
[979.94 --> 987.96]  But there's an interesting Reddit thread talking about how they think it's less of, maybe some of, but it's less of John's influence.
[987.96 --> 991.08]  And it's more of the new board's influence.
[991.08 --> 992.74]  Because Unity went open.
[993.86 --> 994.64]  Can I?
[994.88 --> 995.58]  Public, whatever.
[996.02 --> 996.30]  Yeah.
[996.58 --> 1002.76]  Can I jump in and kind of advocate for Unity for a second here?
[1002.98 --> 1003.42]  Oh, boy.
[1004.56 --> 1005.50]  They're losing money.
[1005.88 --> 1006.64]  What should they do?
[1007.28 --> 1009.06]  This is definitely the wrong way to do it.
[1009.54 --> 1010.22]  I know.
[1010.42 --> 1012.16]  But we agree on that.
[1012.20 --> 1014.36]  I don't know enough about, like, game engine models.
[1014.88 --> 1016.64]  I've always thought they're, like, a little weird.
[1017.40 --> 1017.84]  Yeah.
[1017.84 --> 1023.16]  I mean, I know that Unreal is considered more expensive.
[1023.98 --> 1031.20]  My understanding of Unreal's licensing fees is that, like Unity, it doesn't really cost until it costs.
[1031.36 --> 1031.48]  Yeah.
[1031.72 --> 1034.08]  So they, again...
[1034.08 --> 1036.16]  Which I would actually defend that.
[1036.24 --> 1037.42]  I've always thought that's kind of cool.
[1037.42 --> 1037.54]  Yeah.
[1037.62 --> 1039.22]  I've always thought that that's pretty cool.
[1039.22 --> 1043.18]  So it's in the same way that gaming companies milk their whales.
[1043.40 --> 1045.82]  The gaming engine companies milk their whales.
[1046.54 --> 1047.08]  Whale milk.
[1047.84 --> 1048.90]  I mean, it's a thing.
[1049.40 --> 1050.32]  Probably a thing in Star Wars.
[1050.34 --> 1052.80]  Someone's probably consumed it.
[1052.96 --> 1053.74]  Do you think it's any good?
[1055.38 --> 1057.10]  I mean, game companies love it.
[1058.74 --> 1059.80]  Oh, my God.
[1061.52 --> 1061.92]  Yeah.
[1064.16 --> 1067.10]  So I'm just going to derail completely and go to mine.
[1067.10 --> 1069.88]  So this is Unreal Engine's setup.
[1070.56 --> 1072.46]  So standard license is free to get started.
[1073.20 --> 1073.86]  Very cool.
[1073.86 --> 1077.84]  And it says on it, best for small teams or projects, hobbyists, and learning.
[1078.02 --> 1082.28]  And I have always loved that these tools are free for learning.
[1083.28 --> 1085.18]  That's, like, kind of wild to me.
[1085.82 --> 1089.62]  Like, I don't think you can get Photoshop for free for learning.
[1089.82 --> 1089.92]  Nope.
[1089.92 --> 1094.08]  I think SolidWorks finally has a much...
[1094.08 --> 1094.46]  No, no, no.
[1094.54 --> 1094.94]  Hold on.
[1094.94 --> 1098.46]  They have a much, much less expensive version.
[1099.22 --> 1103.94]  But you cannot commercialize it for more than $2,000.
[1104.72 --> 1108.48]  Or you cannot make more than $2,000 using it.
[1108.48 --> 1111.86]  I have no idea how they enforce that.
[1113.14 --> 1114.56]  Maybe they have some way.
[1114.66 --> 1115.92]  Or maybe it's an honor system.
[1116.10 --> 1116.98]  I'm not sure.
[1117.30 --> 1123.56]  I guess if they catch you, you probably get in lots of trouble somehow or something.
[1124.34 --> 1125.16]  But no.
[1125.64 --> 1127.50]  But they at least have an affordable one now.
[1127.50 --> 1132.40]  But I only bring it up because my understanding is they basically had nothing before.
[1132.60 --> 1137.50]  And I can't think of another industry where you basically just...
[1138.22 --> 1145.46]  Unless you're in school, where you can basically just, as a hobbyist, as a self-learner, just use the tools for free.
[1145.54 --> 1148.74]  Like, the full, fat, professional versions of the tools for free.
[1148.74 --> 1155.00]  Now, to be clear, not every game design tool is free for you to just use.
[1155.12 --> 1158.32]  I mean, nobody's going to let you just use Maya for free.
[1158.66 --> 1164.00]  But at least the engines themselves are accessible to individual hobbyists.
[1165.50 --> 1168.18]  So you were having a look at the Unreal pricing tiers?
[1168.42 --> 1169.54]  When do you have to pay then?
[1171.74 --> 1172.18]  Okay.
[1172.34 --> 1172.92]  Standard license.
[1173.02 --> 1176.16]  For creators and publishers who don't require premium support or custom terms.
[1176.16 --> 1177.84]  Also suitable for students and educators.
[1177.84 --> 1179.32]  Free to get started.
[1179.92 --> 1182.26]  Free to download and free to use in many cases.
[1182.74 --> 1184.64]  See the FAQ when royalties apply.
[1184.84 --> 1186.74]  Okay, so we're going to have a dig through that.
[1187.40 --> 1191.14]  Includes the engine, the entire Quixel Megascans library.
[1191.26 --> 1193.88]  All learning materials, which are very good.
[1194.06 --> 1195.86]  That's the part that I enjoy doing these days.
[1195.92 --> 1199.52]  It's just going through the learning things and just having fun, having it guide me on how to use the tool.
[1200.08 --> 1201.46]  And community-based support.
[1202.16 --> 1207.32]  So I don't know what's in the FAQ, but I think it's like they skim a certain percent on sales, something like that.
[1207.32 --> 1207.76]  Yes.
[1207.84 --> 1211.42]  And then, wow.
[1211.80 --> 1212.70]  I didn't notice that.
[1212.94 --> 1215.14]  I complain about per seat pricing for us.
[1215.56 --> 1222.20]  Enterprise program for non-games professionals seeking premium support, private training, and or custom licensing terms.
[1222.38 --> 1223.10]  That sounds very expensive.
[1223.16 --> 1224.86]  It's $1,500 per seat.
[1225.86 --> 1226.24]  Per year.
[1226.44 --> 1226.80]  Per year.
[1227.02 --> 1227.68]  Oh, that's...
[1227.68 --> 1229.12]  Per year actually makes it a lot easier.
[1229.62 --> 1231.10]  I'm used to seeing those in per month.
[1231.10 --> 1233.98]  Yeah, that's not as bad as I thought it would be.
[1233.98 --> 1238.84]  Yeah, because just G Suite is like $300 a year.
[1239.20 --> 1239.38]  Yeah.
[1239.66 --> 1240.52]  And I don't...
[1240.52 --> 1241.40]  Do we get any support?
[1243.08 --> 1243.88]  Actually, yes.
[1244.00 --> 1247.72]  But honestly, I think that's because they know who we are.
[1247.92 --> 1248.22]  Oh.
[1248.22 --> 1249.62]  I think.
[1250.00 --> 1251.02]  Well, we don't know for sure.
[1251.10 --> 1252.38]  Let's just say we don't know for sure.
[1252.38 --> 1257.84]  I will say the support that I've had from Google recently, like very recently, has actually been amazing.
[1258.66 --> 1265.78]  There's two people at Google that have been extremely helpful recently, helping with like the merge that I'm working on and stuff like that.
[1265.90 --> 1266.78]  They've been awesome.
[1267.68 --> 1268.62]  So, yeah.
[1269.44 --> 1270.48]  And it scales up from there.
[1270.56 --> 1275.06]  I have also heard that Unreal is the expensive one.
[1276.10 --> 1277.34]  And I don't know how to...
[1277.34 --> 1279.70]  I don't feel like diving into their FAQ and stuff like that.
[1279.72 --> 1282.68]  But as far as my understanding goes, it is the expensive option.
[1284.18 --> 1285.66]  And that is a lot per seat.
[1285.66 --> 1288.00]  That does say for non-games professionals.
[1288.60 --> 1293.48]  For game development professionals, it's a custom license that they don't show a price for.
[1294.22 --> 1296.62]  It says negotiable terms, so you probably have to talk to them.
[1297.06 --> 1297.78]  So, I don't know.
[1297.94 --> 1299.02]  One interesting thing, though.
[1299.56 --> 1300.04]  Godot.
[1300.80 --> 1301.52]  Did I say it right?
[1301.58 --> 1301.96]  There you go.
[1302.16 --> 1303.56]  Godot is free.
[1304.52 --> 1304.98]  Cool.
[1305.28 --> 1305.88]  Just free-free.
[1306.72 --> 1309.68]  And that's what people are rushing towards as far as I know.
[1309.68 --> 1315.72]  I saw people in chat point out that Unity has paid its executives exorbitant amounts of money.
[1315.96 --> 1321.88]  Like someone threw out the number $150 million, which is obviously gross when they're losing money.
[1322.14 --> 1329.62]  I don't personally see why executives should make money when the company is not making money in their one job.
[1329.70 --> 1330.64]  You have one job.
[1330.74 --> 1332.96]  You don't actually code anything.
[1333.78 --> 1336.32]  Your job is to make sure the company makes money.
[1337.94 --> 1338.94]  So, okay.
[1339.42 --> 1342.72]  But I do want to point out that that still doesn't fix the problem.
[1343.22 --> 1346.30]  You have a one, however many, what was it?
[1346.38 --> 1348.28]  They've lost a billion dollars in the last four quarters.
[1348.38 --> 1349.94]  You have a billion dollar hole in the boat.
[1350.32 --> 1353.30]  You're not going to plug it with $150 million of executive pay.
[1353.30 --> 1355.86]  Did the $150 million executive pay for one person or the whole suite?
[1355.86 --> 1356.70]  That was a whole bunch of them.
[1356.84 --> 1362.76]  I don't know if it was the whole suite, but someone said, yeah, a bunch of them made like $150 million or something like that.
[1362.84 --> 1365.80]  Unreal is 5% royalty over $1 million USD.
[1366.00 --> 1366.38]  Yeah, okay.
[1367.54 --> 1370.30]  So, let's go back to Unity then.
[1370.30 --> 1371.22]  That doesn't actually sound that bad.
[1371.52 --> 1372.86]  And I'll pose my question again.
[1373.10 --> 1374.06]  What do they do?
[1374.98 --> 1376.30]  They are losing money.
[1376.30 --> 1386.64]  I think we all agree we don't want them to go after the very, very small devs who are just scraping by with a team of three people or whatever else.
[1388.82 --> 1394.84]  So, they have to extract more money from the devs who are selling a lot of copies of their games.
[1395.02 --> 1397.30]  I mean, is it...
[1397.30 --> 1401.36]  I have a couple of ideas, but I just want to know.
[1401.42 --> 1402.60]  What would you have them do?
[1402.60 --> 1407.94]  Because they obviously are going to try to extract more money from the bigger devs who are using their product.
[1408.52 --> 1409.48]  But how should they do it?
[1410.16 --> 1413.92]  I have to break down their whole thing and try to analyze it.
[1413.96 --> 1416.32]  But the price per install stuff is...
[1416.32 --> 1418.00]  I know this is not the answer you're looking for.
[1418.06 --> 1418.98]  It's just not the path.
[1419.66 --> 1420.40]  I know, but...
[1420.40 --> 1421.06]  I know, I know, I know.
[1421.32 --> 1422.34]  But these things...
[1422.34 --> 1430.24]  I think the problem with answering this is that licensing and fee setups that are negotiable
[1430.24 --> 1433.26]  are very difficult to figure out on the outside.
[1433.54 --> 1434.16]  Yep, that's true.
[1434.16 --> 1444.34]  Because what I would say is things like bandwidth contracts at big CDNs and all this other type of stuff is they're always cloak and dagger effectively.
[1444.34 --> 1445.14]  Completely opaque.
[1445.14 --> 1448.78]  I know people personally, and this is...
[1448.78 --> 1449.66]  I'm not talking about them.
[1449.82 --> 1455.80]  I know people personally that have gotten over 50% discounts on what is publicly shown on sites.
[1456.20 --> 1456.28]  Yep.
[1456.28 --> 1458.28]  So, like, it's all just...
[1459.38 --> 1460.10]  Smoke and mirrors.
[1460.30 --> 1460.54]  Yeah.
[1460.90 --> 1461.92]  None of it matters.
[1462.20 --> 1466.98]  So when we start getting into these enterprise tiers where you are negotiating, like this Unreal thing,
[1467.58 --> 1471.62]  oh, for professional game development, yeah, there's no public number.
[1471.96 --> 1473.58]  Contact us and we'll negotiate a term.
[1473.98 --> 1474.28]  That...
[1475.22 --> 1478.32]  How do we even comment on, like...
[1478.32 --> 1478.50]  Sure.
[1478.50 --> 1480.34]  We have no idea what people are actually paying.
[1480.36 --> 1482.34]  Well, there's one thing that we can comment on.
[1482.68 --> 1483.62]  I'll say this much.
[1483.62 --> 1491.08]  Um, if Unity wanted to increase their take from these developers, well, they should have done it on a going forward basis.
[1491.68 --> 1492.20]  Also that.
[1492.40 --> 1495.24]  So, if they wanted to...
[1495.24 --> 1499.24]  And, again, I'm not going to say that per reinstall is the right way to do it,
[1499.26 --> 1503.82]  because any time that the developer is charging once when the game is purchased,
[1504.54 --> 1506.80]  you can't expect them to keep paying you after that.
[1506.80 --> 1512.48]  Like you said before, they could end up paying more in Unity fees than they made on the game in the first place.
[1512.58 --> 1513.10]  That is...
[1513.10 --> 1515.34]  There is genuinely a slice of people that can land in that.
[1515.44 --> 1516.80]  It's obviously ridiculous.
[1517.28 --> 1518.14]  Um, so it should...
[1518.14 --> 1522.64]  It should always be based on some kind of sanity-checked math,
[1522.66 --> 1525.68]  where it has to be some proportion of the actual money someone made.
[1525.76 --> 1528.74]  Otherwise, how are we even having a conversation right now?
[1528.74 --> 1532.48]  But the more important thing is if they wanted to create a new fee structure,
[1532.70 --> 1535.22]  it had to be done on a going forward basis.
[1535.72 --> 1541.54]  I don't see how it can continue to be legal to unilaterally change a contract.
[1541.98 --> 1545.40]  How is it even possible that when I have a Netflix subscription,
[1545.66 --> 1547.66]  bringing it back to something that affects everyone,
[1547.76 --> 1548.50]  you might be sitting there going,
[1548.60 --> 1549.50]  okay, well, I'm not a game developer.
[1549.60 --> 1550.40]  This doesn't affect me.
[1551.24 --> 1552.46]  But do you have a Netflix subscription?
[1552.66 --> 1554.10]  Okay, a lot of people dropped those recently.
[1554.20 --> 1555.96]  Okay, do you have a YouTube premium subscription?
[1555.96 --> 1560.46]  Do you have any kind of subscription where unilaterally,
[1560.64 --> 1564.04]  the other side, the other party has changed the rate
[1564.04 --> 1566.34]  and somehow your credit card is still being charged?
[1567.54 --> 1569.66]  How is that even possible?
[1569.98 --> 1571.82]  How does anyone think that's okay?
[1572.34 --> 1572.44]  Yeah.
[1573.00 --> 1579.18]  And the funny thing about it is I'm not 100% sure why,
[1579.92 --> 1581.82]  especially when it comes to web subscriptions.
[1581.82 --> 1586.84]  I mean, we still honor our original pricing for float plane.
[1587.04 --> 1591.66]  And my understanding for that $3 tier is that we don't lose money on it.
[1591.84 --> 1591.94]  No.
[1593.04 --> 1594.90]  So why is it then?
[1595.32 --> 1597.32]  We like meme about it, but we don't.
[1597.40 --> 1601.86]  With YouTube, I kind of get it because I do know that there's storage costs.
[1601.98 --> 1603.96]  Even if we ignore the bandwidth costs,
[1604.12 --> 1607.80]  which are scaling still, right?
[1607.88 --> 1609.20]  They are still going down.
[1609.20 --> 1613.06]  The storage costs are not, which is one of the things that I outlined
[1613.06 --> 1618.36]  in the YouTube should charge for 4K video that we did a while back
[1618.36 --> 1623.64]  because hard drives used to get exponentially cheaper,
[1623.64 --> 1625.34]  and now they don't.
[1625.40 --> 1627.64]  In fact, they are leveling out.
[1627.72 --> 1629.42]  They're asymptoting at this point, right?
[1629.50 --> 1631.84]  One thing I will argue is that storage has gotten easier.
[1632.94 --> 1633.30]  Interesting.
[1633.30 --> 1637.88]  So while the cost of the drives, and honestly, when you're at Google scale,
[1637.88 --> 1640.94]  I'm sure this part doesn't really affect you much because you're working on future
[1640.94 --> 1641.76]  engineering or whatever.
[1641.90 --> 1643.88]  I'm sure you use all those same people for different things.
[1644.14 --> 1653.08]  But the same amount of person effort that would need to go into maintaining a data store
[1653.08 --> 1656.86]  at a certain size, globally accessible by everyone around the world,
[1656.96 --> 1657.82]  all this other type of stuff,
[1657.82 --> 1661.02]  the amount of effort that would go into doing that has gotten easier.
[1661.58 --> 1667.32]  So people hours going into it required is less, so costs are down more.
[1667.56 --> 1672.64]  But the problem is also getting increasingly more complex.
[1672.74 --> 1675.00]  Are you sure it's fewer development hours?
[1675.96 --> 1676.52]  Okay.
[1676.72 --> 1678.94]  So that's the caveat that I put on,
[1679.06 --> 1681.70]  is I'm sure they would use those people to do other things,
[1681.98 --> 1684.34]  like work on innovation or whatever else.
[1684.34 --> 1688.20]  Yeah, because I would say that it's not directly related to storage,
[1688.34 --> 1692.74]  but if I had to guess, I'd say the development hours that have gone into something like
[1692.74 --> 1697.52]  the custom encoding hardware that they use now.
[1698.06 --> 1702.10]  Yeah, but that's technically other things.
[1702.38 --> 1706.26]  Okay, but it's all in service of more efficient codecs
[1706.26 --> 1708.10]  so we can bring down our storage costs.
[1708.22 --> 1708.70]  I do agree.
[1709.02 --> 1709.16]  Yeah.
[1709.30 --> 1709.60]  Okay.
[1709.90 --> 1712.52]  But maintaining the data store is easier now.
[1712.52 --> 1715.24]  They have probably shifted those costs
[1715.24 --> 1719.34]  to departments that are able to make that data store more efficient
[1719.34 --> 1721.10]  or more usable or whatever else.
[1721.16 --> 1724.42]  But then they're probably losing some cost on ever-rising energy costs,
[1724.42 --> 1727.66]  which are just hammering the data center right now.
[1727.78 --> 1728.78]  It's a decent point as well.
[1728.92 --> 1729.10]  Yeah.
[1729.32 --> 1730.68]  So my point is,
[1730.78 --> 1733.84]  I actually do kind of understand why YouTube's getting more expensive.
[1734.06 --> 1736.32]  I'm not 100% sure for something like a Spotify.
[1737.10 --> 1739.24]  I'm not really sure for something like a Netflix.
[1739.24 --> 1742.30]  I find Spotify to be very expensive.
[1742.52 --> 1744.26]  I'm surprised at how expensive it is.
[1744.26 --> 1745.64]  I don't pay for it.
[1746.36 --> 1748.38]  Me neither, but when I look at the...
[1748.38 --> 1750.58]  YouTube Premium is kind of a banging deal.
[1750.66 --> 1750.94]  Yeah.
[1751.08 --> 1752.72]  Considering that YouTube Music is included.
[1752.84 --> 1753.94]  You just get the family plan.
[1754.34 --> 1757.04]  You find four family members.
[1757.16 --> 1758.56]  Sorry, I had something stuck in my eye there.
[1758.74 --> 1760.26]  And then you're all paying,
[1760.68 --> 1762.00]  what does it work out to?
[1762.06 --> 1764.34]  Like $4.50 a month or five...
[1764.34 --> 1764.84]  Once you divide it out.
[1764.84 --> 1770.36]  Yeah, $5.50 a month or something stupid like that for YouTube Premium and YouTube Music.
[1770.84 --> 1771.10]  Okay.
[1771.18 --> 1774.80]  So maybe Spotify kind of works the same way because their family plan is six people.
[1775.34 --> 1775.66]  Okay.
[1775.80 --> 1776.06]  All right.
[1776.06 --> 1776.76]  Well, that's not too bad.
[1776.78 --> 1777.04]  Which is pretty big.
[1777.10 --> 1779.90]  So if you use it that way, it's $17 Canadian a month.
[1780.00 --> 1783.92]  If you have a family with six people in it...
[1783.92 --> 1784.16]  Yeah.
[1785.16 --> 1785.44]  Yeah.
[1785.44 --> 1787.48]  Then it's very affordable.
[1787.78 --> 1787.96]  Yeah.
[1788.38 --> 1790.30]  I mean, you know, family.
[1790.84 --> 1791.32]  Family.
[1791.46 --> 1791.72]  Okay.
[1791.86 --> 1792.28]  Interesting.
[1792.60 --> 1794.90]  The family plan with six accounts is $17 Canadian.
[1795.26 --> 1799.98]  But the duo, so two people, is $15 Canadian.
[1800.64 --> 1803.28]  So you should get a bigger family.
[1803.48 --> 1803.70]  Yeah.
[1804.66 --> 1809.10]  Speaking of sharing things with your family, this is breaking.
[1809.26 --> 1810.74]  This is not our second topic.
[1811.00 --> 1812.44]  This is not in the doc at all.
[1812.44 --> 1814.28]  But we are...
[1814.28 --> 1815.76]  This is now our second topic.
[1815.86 --> 1817.64]  We're going to talk about this right now.
[1818.02 --> 1824.90]  Plex just sent out a notice to users who are running their Plex server on a VPS or dedicated
[1824.90 --> 1826.26]  server at Hetzner.
[1827.08 --> 1832.80]  They will be blocking access to these servers effective October 12th.
[1832.80 --> 1837.24]  You will have less than a month to not have your Plex server hosted at Hetzner.
[1837.24 --> 1845.76]  And this is apparently, according to lowendbox.com, part of a crackdown on piracy.
[1846.34 --> 1848.90]  Well, let's talk about that.
[1849.00 --> 1857.74]  Plex has been trying to remake its image over the last few years as a legitimate streaming
[1857.74 --> 1860.48]  service, I guess, or whatever you want to call it.
[1860.48 --> 1866.22]  But you can watch freely available, and I believe you can even rent content.
[1866.32 --> 1866.42]  It's not Hexner.
[1866.64 --> 1867.50]  It's Hetzner.
[1867.50 --> 1867.94]  Hetzner.
[1868.12 --> 1869.08]  And it's a server host.
[1869.14 --> 1870.24]  Did I say Hexner?
[1870.28 --> 1870.50]  No.
[1870.62 --> 1872.76]  Some people were saying that in chat.
[1872.82 --> 1873.74]  So I was helping them find it.
[1873.78 --> 1874.16]  Oh, okay.
[1874.58 --> 1877.54]  H-E-T-Z-N-E-R.
[1877.82 --> 1878.26]  Hetzner.
[1878.40 --> 1881.30]  In fact, I believe they've done sponsor spots on the show before.
[1881.32 --> 1881.62]  Yeah, I think so.
[1881.62 --> 1887.66]  Yeah, because you can definitely do VPS and dedicated server hosting at Hetzner, and my
[1887.66 --> 1890.10]  understanding is it's a pretty good product overall.
[1890.48 --> 1895.42]  But anyone who's running a Plex server there is having a pretty bad time right now trying
[1895.42 --> 1899.00]  to figure out where the heck they're going to move all their data while their Plex server.
[1899.36 --> 1903.98]  If you're not familiar with Plex, basically, I mean, do I give the sanitized version, or
[1903.98 --> 1905.62]  do I just explain what Plex is?
[1906.52 --> 1906.88]  Damn.
[1906.88 --> 1909.12]  I think you just explained what it is.
[1909.12 --> 1916.76]  Plex is a great tool for filthy pirates who collect ISOs and MP4s and whatever kind
[1916.76 --> 1917.46]  of media file.
[1917.64 --> 1921.78]  One of the most powerful things about it is you can dump pretty much any kind of media
[1921.78 --> 1926.66]  file into a library, and as long as you somewhat follow their conventions for naming your files,
[1926.76 --> 1931.64]  and you can use tools like FileBot, for example, to ensure or to quickly rename your
[1931.64 --> 1936.72]  files and make sure that they adhere to Plex's formatting, it should pretty much figure
[1936.72 --> 1944.64]  out what it is, and then dump it into a graphical library that is easily navigatable and has
[1944.64 --> 1950.06]  all the metadata, including cover art and actors, and it'll even pull up things like extras and
[1950.06 --> 1951.94]  behind the scenes, so you can play that back.
[1952.02 --> 1955.26]  It'll pull reviews from, I believe, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes.
[1955.30 --> 1957.52]  Don't quote me on exactly where it'll pull reviews from.
[1958.14 --> 1963.16]  And it'll pull actors so you could browse and, oh, I want to watch other things with this
[1963.16 --> 1964.26]  actor in it, for example.
[1965.12 --> 1968.36]  And there are lots of legitimate uses for Plex.
[1968.46 --> 1973.42]  You can rip your own files and dump those onto your server, and Plex will serve you up
[1973.42 --> 1973.68]  those.
[1974.00 --> 1980.50]  But what I suspect is that most people who are running a VPS at Hetzner are probably not
[1980.50 --> 1986.18]  uploading their Blu-rays to that VPS and are probably using it also as a torrent box and
[1986.18 --> 1990.80]  pulling down ISOs from places where ISOs might be found.
[1990.98 --> 1992.46]  Yeah, lots of Linux ISOs.
[1992.46 --> 1998.54]  And my take on this is that Plex is trying to shed that image.
[1998.66 --> 2002.14]  And we've seen that over, I mean, honestly...
[2002.14 --> 2003.18]  But why if they're trying to do that?
[2003.24 --> 2004.44]  Why just ban out Hetzner?
[2005.92 --> 2007.00]  Well, it's not that.
[2007.00 --> 2007.86]  Why is it specific?
[2007.86 --> 2017.08]  My guess would be that Hetzner is probably the flavor of the month, kind of preferred.
[2017.40 --> 2018.52]  Everyone uses it.
[2018.86 --> 2020.24]  I don't know that for sure.
[2020.24 --> 2023.08]  It does get recommended because as far as my understanding goes, for large data storage,
[2023.16 --> 2024.12]  they're highly cost effective.
[2024.32 --> 2025.38]  This is not an ad spot.
[2025.54 --> 2027.18]  That's just my understanding.
[2027.40 --> 2027.54]  Yeah.
[2027.64 --> 2028.52]  So there you go.
[2028.58 --> 2033.04]  And then someone like a Backblaze, for example, yeah, sure, they're very cost effective for
[2033.04 --> 2036.92]  data storage, but I don't think they even do VPS or dedicated server hosting or anything
[2036.92 --> 2037.36]  like that.
[2037.36 --> 2037.56]  For who, sorry?
[2037.86 --> 2038.62]  Uh, Backblaze.
[2039.52 --> 2040.20]  Oh, yeah.
[2040.20 --> 2040.98]  I think it's just storage.
[2041.00 --> 2041.64]  I don't think you'd use it.
[2041.86 --> 2048.38]  My thing is there's just like, there are a lot of other alternatives that are very similar.
[2049.42 --> 2053.96]  Um, yeah, people are saying Hetzner has a lot of Plex users that resell access to their
[2053.96 --> 2054.70]  Plex servers.
[2055.92 --> 2056.36]  Ah.
[2056.82 --> 2057.26]  Interesting.
[2058.08 --> 2058.50]  So.
[2058.50 --> 2060.22]  But why would that be unique to Hetzner?
[2060.32 --> 2060.64]  So let's.
[2060.64 --> 2062.88]  That's the thing that keeps getting confusing for me.
[2063.00 --> 2065.80]  Well, if, well, that's why I brought up Backblaze, right?
[2065.80 --> 2072.54]  Because you can find places that have, you know, affordable storage and you can find services
[2072.54 --> 2078.54]  that have affordable compute, uh, whether it's a VPS or whether it's a dedicated box, but
[2078.54 --> 2080.08]  finding somewhere that has both.
[2080.08 --> 2084.48]  Well, kind of like you said, maybe Hetzner is just the one right now.
[2084.86 --> 2086.62]  And okay.
[2086.62 --> 2090.82]  We do need to talk about that whole sharing of Plex libraries.
[2091.00 --> 2096.86]  So Plex has a feature that allows you to share your library with family and friends.
[2097.42 --> 2097.94]  So there are.
[2097.94 --> 2101.08]  I've been, I've been offered access to people's Linux ISOs a few times.
[2101.76 --> 2102.98]  You mean their Plex server?
[2103.18 --> 2103.42]  Yeah.
[2103.70 --> 2105.26]  And that stores Linux ISOs?
[2105.26 --> 2105.38]  Yeah.
[2105.48 --> 2105.66]  Yeah.
[2105.72 --> 2105.90]  Yeah.
[2105.92 --> 2107.08]  I mean, well, I mean, you're on mine.
[2107.42 --> 2107.66]  Yeah.
[2108.00 --> 2108.20]  Yeah.
[2108.44 --> 2110.38]  And so my, my sister is also on mine.
[2110.44 --> 2116.72]  So I, I actually, there are people with, uh, with, like with, um, with their own individual
[2116.72 --> 2117.58]  Plex accounts.
[2117.58 --> 2122.20]  And I don't think they even need to be paid Plex accounts because the thing about Plex is
[2122.20 --> 2128.32]  that as long as you're not using their, um, as long as you're not using their, their proxy
[2128.32 --> 2133.20]  service, all the bandwidth is going directly from the host to the client.
[2133.20 --> 2135.54]  So there's no actual cost for them.
[2136.00 --> 2140.56]  Um, so if some, if my sister was to watch a movie, for example, as long as my upload
[2140.56 --> 2144.02]  is up to snuff and her download is up to snuff, then it's good to go.
[2144.58 --> 2151.50]  But if I had many, many, many friends who paid me, for example, then running something
[2151.50 --> 2156.60]  like that off of my residential internet connection wouldn't be practical anymore and would probably
[2156.60 --> 2157.58]  hurt my business model.
[2157.58 --> 2166.78]  So if Plex is trying to de-piracy imagify themselves, then cracking down on these commercial users
[2166.78 --> 2172.20]  of the product is probably going to go a long way to getting them into, in better graces,
[2172.38 --> 2178.84]  at least with the content providers who they're trying to work with on the, on the other side
[2178.84 --> 2182.44]  of their business where they're trying to become a legitimate streaming service that
[2182.44 --> 2184.04]  doesn't cater to piracy.
[2184.04 --> 2188.42]  And we've seen this move from them telegraphed for, for years at this point.
[2188.46 --> 2193.24]  I mean, at least, yeah, I've talked about it a fair bit for at least five years.
[2193.24 --> 2202.28]  Plex has clearly prioritized the legit side of their business over the, um, the home media
[2202.28 --> 2204.62]  collector side of their business.
[2204.62 --> 2209.70]  Like when's the last time that like download to device feature worked properly where it
[2209.70 --> 2213.36]  transcodes a version that's mobile device friendly and then dumps it onto your device.
[2213.36 --> 2215.22]  And they've given me excuses for this.
[2215.26 --> 2219.36]  I don't know if you guys know this, but we have, we have paused any sponsorship relationship
[2219.36 --> 2219.72]  with Plex.
[2219.76 --> 2220.72]  I still use the product.
[2220.80 --> 2225.04]  I still love a lot of things about the product, but we've paused our sponsorship relationship
[2225.04 --> 2228.76]  with them until they, uh, they meet a bunch of, sorry, what's that?
[2229.16 --> 2230.62]  What got us onto this topic?
[2230.80 --> 2231.26]  I don't know.
[2231.26 --> 2233.96]  Oh, uh, just, uh, someone, uh, talked about it in chat.
[2234.42 --> 2234.62]  Oh.
[2234.74 --> 2236.12]  And I just thought, I thought it was really interesting.
[2236.12 --> 2236.36]  Okay.
[2236.42 --> 2237.04]  What do you want?
[2237.46 --> 2238.80]  No, I was just trying to figure it out.
[2238.80 --> 2239.18]  Yeah, it's fine.
[2239.24 --> 2240.00]  It's a WAN show.
[2240.10 --> 2242.10]  Does it, what guides the WAN show?
[2243.26 --> 2244.30]  Who knows?
[2245.10 --> 2250.78]  Linus's ADD times Dan's ADD divided by Luke's laugh.
[2250.90 --> 2251.32]  I don't know.
[2252.06 --> 2252.96]  That's the formula.
[2253.30 --> 2255.08]  I'm amazed it happens any week.
[2255.08 --> 2261.56]  Uh, Xavier in, in float plane chat said, uh, that you do not have to have premium accounts
[2261.56 --> 2263.40]  for the people added onto yours.
[2263.60 --> 2263.72]  Yeah.
[2263.90 --> 2267.04]  Um, he said his, his whole family has access to his Linux.
[2267.14 --> 2268.32]  So that's exactly the thing.
[2268.32 --> 2274.10]  So people are monetizing their one premium account, which Plex is one of the companies
[2274.10 --> 2275.56]  that still does lifetime accounts.
[2275.56 --> 2281.24]  Like I said, there are things that I still think are pretty cool about Plex, but we've paused
[2281.24 --> 2283.98]  the relationship until they get mobile downloading working.
[2284.58 --> 2289.98]  Um, I think there's a couple of other things that were kind of on my list of, of, Hey, you
[2289.98 --> 2294.38]  guys need to actually take care of the people who, you know, bought your software for all
[2294.38 --> 2299.08]  these years, including lifetime access to Plex pass and stuff like that, based on these
[2299.08 --> 2303.16]  features that are supposed to work before you prioritize the development of these new
[2303.16 --> 2303.98]  areas of the business.
[2303.98 --> 2306.62]  Like this is actually not, this is actually not cool.
[2306.68 --> 2307.82]  How long this stuff has been broken.
[2307.82 --> 2312.10]  I haven't been able to download using that downloader feature for probably over two years
[2312.10 --> 2312.64]  at this point.
[2313.00 --> 2314.34]  That's, that's not okay.
[2314.44 --> 2318.02]  That's the kind of feature that is critical, right?
[2318.12 --> 2323.24]  That I want to be able to load some media onto my phone before I get on the plane.
[2324.16 --> 2330.88]  If that's broken, there should be like an emergency meeting and people should immediately be reassigned
[2330.88 --> 2331.16]  to it.
[2331.20 --> 2336.28]  That's not like, maybe we'll fix it in two years kind of feature from, from my point of
[2336.28 --> 2336.44]  view.
[2336.44 --> 2344.94]  Um, but I, I think this is just yet another move that Plex is making to, to legitimize
[2344.94 --> 2345.86]  the service.
[2345.86 --> 2350.34]  And I can, I can see why a lot of people are talking about Jellyfin and MB in the, in the
[2350.34 --> 2355.84]  float plane chat, because those are projects that due to their structure are unlikely to
[2355.84 --> 2357.24]  ever change in this way.
[2357.26 --> 2359.70]  Although ever is a really, really, really big word.
[2359.70 --> 2366.54]  And at some point I feel like every company that starts out catering to pirates figures
[2366.54 --> 2370.54]  out that paying users will give them a lot more money.
[2374.54 --> 2375.58]  Bit of an issue.
[2375.58 --> 2376.58]  Yeah.
[2378.58 --> 2383.30]  Ah, yeah.
[2383.50 --> 2383.90]  I don't know.
[2383.94 --> 2387.18]  There's people asking me, like, can I, can I, can I change this?
[2387.24 --> 2388.32]  Can I talk to Plex about it?
[2388.36 --> 2389.08]  No, no man.
[2389.10 --> 2389.52]  I can't.
[2389.52 --> 2389.92]  I've already.
[2390.12 --> 2390.46]  He did.
[2390.48 --> 2391.46]  He did what he can do.
[2391.54 --> 2393.94]  I've already thrown as much weight behind this as I can.
[2394.00 --> 2397.68]  I've gone, look, we're not going to work with you guys until you get back to basics a
[2397.68 --> 2398.28]  little bit here.
[2398.78 --> 2406.00]  And they basically were like, like, I don't, I don't, I don't even know if we got a response.
[2406.10 --> 2408.38]  Maybe we got a response that was like, you know what?
[2408.42 --> 2409.34]  I think, hold on.
[2409.36 --> 2410.44]  No, I think they did respond.
[2410.50 --> 2412.78]  And it was basically like, you got to understand there's a lot of challenges.
[2413.34 --> 2415.04]  And I was like, okay, I get it.
[2415.12 --> 2416.00]  Challenges are challenging.
[2416.12 --> 2419.74]  And then, you know, once you've overcome those challenges, then we'll be happy to kind
[2419.74 --> 2421.26]  of, we'll be happy to work with you guys again.
[2421.26 --> 2424.32]  Cause I, I gotta, I gotta reiterate this.
[2424.32 --> 2425.46]  I use the product.
[2425.84 --> 2426.86]  I like the product.
[2426.86 --> 2430.68]  There's a big difference between brands whose products I will use.
[2430.80 --> 2434.78]  I use private internet access, but we don't do sponsor spots with them anymore.
[2434.78 --> 2442.30]  Just because of a lot of the scummy marketing that has gone on in the VPN industry that I
[2442.30 --> 2445.84]  think has soured people on hearing about them at all.
[2446.06 --> 2450.72]  We also don't work with them because of a couple of experiences we've had working with
[2450.72 --> 2452.52]  VPNs that have then changed hands.
[2452.78 --> 2455.32]  At which point we kind of go, okay, so we just.
[2456.86 --> 2457.80]  Sold a service.
[2458.16 --> 2461.12]  And then the potential changes to that service could.
[2461.24 --> 2462.94]  And the data that that service could potentially.
[2463.22 --> 2465.30]  Could make it no longer trustworthy for our users.
[2465.30 --> 2469.94]  We just, we, we, we, we went around that merry-go-round one too many times.
[2470.16 --> 2470.26]  Yeah.
[2470.88 --> 2472.76]  But that doesn't change the fact that I like the product.
[2472.84 --> 2473.50]  I use the product.
[2473.62 --> 2475.00]  Same with, uh, man.
[2475.00 --> 2476.42]  People keep bringing up Anchor.
[2476.56 --> 2480.94]  Every time an Anchor product makes its way into a video, people go, oh, you said, you,
[2480.94 --> 2481.38]  you said, you did.
[2481.68 --> 2484.64]  I said we wouldn't work with them in a sponsorship capacity anymore.
[2485.12 --> 2487.88]  I never said it wasn't a good product and that I wouldn't keep using.
[2487.94 --> 2493.84]  I mean, wouldn't use a Eufy like security camera until I, you know, I've seen an independent
[2493.84 --> 2494.74]  security researcher.
[2494.74 --> 2498.24]  Because I was, I was at a person that I know's house recently with a baby.
[2498.60 --> 2504.28]  Uh, and I noticed that they had a Eufy baby monitor and I was like, oh no.
[2504.42 --> 2509.92]  And then figured out that it was, I didn't, to be fair, I didn't look this up, but I was
[2509.92 --> 2513.44]  insisted, uh, on by them that it was a local only one.
[2513.44 --> 2516.60]  Like they didn't, they themselves didn't even have a portal to view it remotely.
[2516.74 --> 2518.28]  They didn't connect it to a network, et cetera.
[2518.92 --> 2521.80]  Um, so I was like, whew, we're cool.
[2522.14 --> 2525.36]  Handyman and float plane chat brings up a really good point.
[2525.86 --> 2527.72]  Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2527.84 --> 2531.56]  But the thing that you're missing is that Plex is a company with liability.
[2532.12 --> 2540.56]  Um, I think that it would be difficult to nail Plex on this, but if I was Plex, do I want
[2540.56 --> 2541.48]  to play with that fire?
[2541.48 --> 2543.52]  Probably not.
[2543.66 --> 2550.06]  If this is something that has gotten high profile enough that it's gotten someone's attention.
[2551.22 --> 2556.82]  And honestly, this like one month deadline acting on this now kind of smells like that.
[2556.96 --> 2562.44]  It smells like they got a call from someone that went, we're turning off everything.
[2562.56 --> 2565.74]  If you guys don't address this immediately.
[2565.86 --> 2567.68]  And I know you can address this.
[2567.68 --> 2571.96]  Maybe someone with enough technical understanding that they were able to come at them and go,
[2572.10 --> 2581.36]  the, the, the IP blocks that are available per major data center provider are readily
[2581.36 --> 2581.90]  available.
[2582.28 --> 2583.76]  You guys could block these.
[2583.86 --> 2585.14]  You could do it immediately.
[2585.42 --> 2590.24]  The fact that you haven't done it means you're complicit deal with this now.
[2590.24 --> 2594.12]  I could, I could totally see that being a realistic scenario here.
[2594.58 --> 2595.32]  Yeah, definitely.
[2598.14 --> 2599.38]  Back to unity though.
[2599.94 --> 2601.08]  Oh, are we going back to that?
[2601.20 --> 2601.32]  Sure.
[2601.38 --> 2603.48]  Well, I don't think we actually technically finished the topic.
[2603.78 --> 2604.00]  Oh no.
[2604.06 --> 2608.22]  People are talking about when VPN now again, it's called float.
[2608.34 --> 2608.76]  We're bringing it.
[2608.82 --> 2609.38]  We're bringing it back.
[2609.48 --> 2609.72]  No, no.
[2609.72 --> 2611.08]  It's going to be when VPN now.
[2611.30 --> 2612.86]  Oh, and we'll have float VPN.
[2612.98 --> 2614.66]  We'll just have, we'll be like VPN companies.
[2614.68 --> 2615.00]  Ah, competing products.
[2615.30 --> 2615.48]  Yeah.
[2615.54 --> 2617.56]  Where we'll just have multiple VPN products.
[2617.78 --> 2618.04]  Yeah.
[2618.42 --> 2619.08]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2619.74 --> 2619.98]  Yeah.
[2621.74 --> 2622.10]  Yeah.
[2623.24 --> 2623.60]  Okay.
[2623.72 --> 2624.66]  So what's left here?
[2624.74 --> 2630.40]  I think we went through most of it, but there is a discussion question from Riley who says,
[2630.40 --> 2633.14]  what game companies are doing things right right now?
[2633.44 --> 2636.94]  Is there any way gamers can incentivize companies to promote the right people?
[2636.94 --> 2637.14]  Oh no.
[2637.16 --> 2638.14]  We were doing topic two.
[2638.30 --> 2639.26]  The unity topics done.
[2640.24 --> 2640.50]  Oh.
[2640.78 --> 2641.74]  Unless there's something in particular.
[2641.74 --> 2643.36]  We didn't actually get to topic two.
[2643.82 --> 2644.40]  No, no, we did.
[2644.46 --> 2646.52]  He put up topic two and then I started talking about Hetzner.
[2647.34 --> 2648.34]  Dan and I were insane.
[2648.36 --> 2650.00]  Yeah, but Hetzner wasn't a...
[2650.00 --> 2650.20]  Dan?
[2650.20 --> 2651.68]  You just invented a topic.
[2651.84 --> 2652.48]  Dan, were we insane?
[2652.48 --> 2653.02]  That's illegal.
[2653.60 --> 2656.30]  I just, I just followed the time on my sheet.
[2656.46 --> 2656.68]  Yeah.
[2656.74 --> 2659.00]  And then you can do what you want with the cards.
[2659.00 --> 2659.24]  He's a robot.
[2659.74 --> 2660.66]  He's not a robot.
[2660.78 --> 2661.34]  He's bread.
[2661.48 --> 2661.74]  I don't know.
[2662.56 --> 2663.92]  You can't breed a robot.
[2664.24 --> 2666.14]  He has to be organic if he's bread.
[2666.32 --> 2667.92]  He's a bread pusheen now.
[2667.92 --> 2668.54]  What is that?
[2668.66 --> 2669.70]  It's a bread pusheen.
[2670.34 --> 2671.52]  It's a pusheen, but it's bread.
[2671.52 --> 2672.20]  Kitty bread.
[2672.28 --> 2672.92]  Look at the top of it.
[2672.92 --> 2673.12]  Kitty bread.
[2673.12 --> 2673.70]  Show the top of it.
[2673.72 --> 2674.38]  What the f***?
[2674.42 --> 2674.98]  It's a loaf.
[2675.30 --> 2675.66]  Okay.
[2676.18 --> 2676.42]  Yeah.
[2676.54 --> 2677.70]  Yeah, I've seen enough of that.
[2677.86 --> 2678.06]  Yep.
[2680.04 --> 2680.98]  What's going on?
[2681.24 --> 2681.64]  Uh...
[2681.64 --> 2683.68]  Uh, we're done topic two now.
[2683.70 --> 2686.26]  You actually have to do the third one.
[2686.38 --> 2686.68]  Wait.
[2687.06 --> 2687.30]  Wait.
[2688.10 --> 2688.46]  Wait.
[2688.58 --> 2689.48]  That was a topic.
[2689.68 --> 2690.36]  No, wait.
[2690.72 --> 2691.14]  Yes.
[2691.28 --> 2691.48]  Wait.
[2691.88 --> 2696.64]  Scroll up in floatplane chat and find LDT Labs Jake and read that message.
[2696.64 --> 2698.30]  He only tagged me in it, but read that message.
[2699.14 --> 2699.54]  What?
[2700.22 --> 2705.04]  I founded and ran the Pirate Party of Canada's VPN system when I was leader of the party.
[2706.52 --> 2706.92]  What?
[2707.16 --> 2707.46]  Okay.
[2707.74 --> 2708.26]  In...
[2708.26 --> 2710.12]  We actually had a pirate party.
[2710.52 --> 2710.92]  What?
[2711.32 --> 2711.92]  Um...
[2711.92 --> 2712.72]  That was you?
[2714.00 --> 2714.50]  Well, no.
[2714.50 --> 2716.00]  He didn't found the pirate party.
[2716.08 --> 2718.00]  He just founded and ran their VPN system.
[2718.02 --> 2719.92]  No, he said it when I was the leader of the party.
[2720.82 --> 2721.98]  Oh, when he was the leader of the...
[2721.98 --> 2723.92]  When I was the leader of the party.
[2725.16 --> 2725.62]  Okay.
[2725.68 --> 2726.52]  One second here.
[2731.14 --> 2736.06]  Oh, my God.
[2736.48 --> 2739.98]  I think we talked about you on WAN Show back when the set...
[2739.98 --> 2745.92]  What the heck?
[2746.70 --> 2747.82]  That was you!
[2748.00 --> 2748.84]  Oh, no.
[2748.84 --> 2750.44]  We talked about you on WAN Show years ago.
[2750.62 --> 2751.28]  Oh, no.
[2752.00 --> 2752.94]  I'm not even kidding.
[2753.12 --> 2756.16]  I'm pretty sure it was the red and blue set on the other side of the building.
[2756.50 --> 2757.46]  And we talked about...
[2757.46 --> 2759.14]  We talked about the Canadian Pirate Party.
[2759.14 --> 2760.84]  No, I helped found the party.
[2760.98 --> 2764.90]  I was the youngest leader of a federally registered party in Canadian history.
[2766.70 --> 2768.54]  How has this never come up?
[2769.98 --> 2772.46]  I mean...
[2772.46 --> 2775.74]  If I was applying for jobs, I probably wouldn't bring it up either.
[2776.26 --> 2776.66]  Okay.
[2776.76 --> 2777.90]  But he's worked here for a while.
[2777.96 --> 2779.88]  We, like, talk about stuff sometimes.
[2780.02 --> 2781.10]  How has this never come up?
[2781.14 --> 2781.82]  I don't know.
[2782.32 --> 2783.72]  Oh, my God.
[2785.84 --> 2786.24]  Wow.
[2787.32 --> 2788.78]  I got to be honest with you.
[2788.92 --> 2789.54]  That's amazing.
[2789.66 --> 2791.04]  It wouldn't have affected your prospects.
[2791.42 --> 2791.96]  No, yeah.
[2792.08 --> 2793.82]  I probably would have thought it was hilarious.
[2794.00 --> 2794.30]  Yeah.
[2794.54 --> 2795.64]  But, um...
[2795.64 --> 2796.20]  But, I mean, that's not...
[2796.20 --> 2799.16]  I do feel a little blindsided finding out about it after the fact.
[2799.16 --> 2799.22]  Yeah.
[2799.22 --> 2799.94]  It's not...
[2799.94 --> 2801.70]  Yeah, it's not general advice, but...
[2801.70 --> 2802.08]  Yeah.
[2802.30 --> 2802.58]  Yeah.
[2802.70 --> 2803.10]  Okay.
[2803.24 --> 2803.64]  Anywho.
[2803.76 --> 2804.30]  Long time ago.
[2804.36 --> 2804.88]  That's fair.
[2804.98 --> 2805.26]  But, like...
[2805.26 --> 2805.28]  Yeah.
[2805.28 --> 2806.66]  It was 14 years ago.
[2807.20 --> 2807.56]  Wow.
[2807.92 --> 2808.62]  That's hilarious.
[2808.84 --> 2809.88]  So, so, so, yeah.
[2809.96 --> 2811.68]  The Pirate Party of Canada was a thing.
[2811.80 --> 2814.30]  I told everyone in my family that the Pirate Party existed.
[2814.38 --> 2814.54]  Yeah.
[2814.70 --> 2814.76]  I mean...
[2814.76 --> 2816.12]  I talked about it.
[2816.12 --> 2817.70]  I never considered voting for it.
[2817.78 --> 2818.10]  Oh, no.
[2818.10 --> 2818.62]  Because I was like...
[2818.62 --> 2819.32]  Sorry, but...
[2819.32 --> 2819.78]  Yeah, sorry.
[2819.84 --> 2821.10]  You didn't have a real platform.
[2821.36 --> 2822.24]  No offense.
[2825.02 --> 2825.84]  Oh, man.
[2826.04 --> 2826.86]  Oh, man.
[2826.98 --> 2827.30]  Wow.
[2827.52 --> 2827.62]  Okay.
[2827.62 --> 2827.92]  Okay.
[2827.92 --> 2829.88]  So, so we're bringing it back now then, I guess, obviously.
[2830.66 --> 2831.04]  Yeah.
[2831.84 --> 2832.36]  Why not?
[2832.46 --> 2833.72]  I mean, we've already got the leadership.
[2834.08 --> 2834.38]  Yeah.
[2834.38 --> 2836.64]  Now all we need is supporters.
[2837.54 --> 2839.52]  I mean, we could drum some up.
[2839.52 --> 2842.54]  The Pirate Party ship can float on the float VPN.
[2842.78 --> 2843.02]  Yeah.
[2843.24 --> 2843.46]  Yeah.
[2843.52 --> 2846.34]  And I mean, I could probably do some fiery speeches.
[2846.70 --> 2847.30]  Oh, I'm sure.
[2847.46 --> 2847.70]  Yeah.
[2847.82 --> 2848.26]  I mean...
[2848.26 --> 2848.44]  Yeah.
[2848.94 --> 2849.74]  We got it.
[2849.74 --> 2850.38]  We got writers.
[2850.52 --> 2851.96]  We got writers for the speeches.
[2852.26 --> 2852.80]  We got...
[2852.80 --> 2853.08]  Yeah.
[2853.32 --> 2853.76]  We got...
[2853.76 --> 2853.88]  Yeah.
[2854.60 --> 2856.22]  New Canadian law.
[2856.66 --> 2863.28]  Everyone must receive one Canadian-sponsored red and white LTT screwdriver.
[2863.28 --> 2865.62]  What?
[2866.06 --> 2866.68]  I don't know.
[2866.72 --> 2867.70]  We have a dumb policy.
[2867.70 --> 2868.80]  They would have to steal them.
[2868.86 --> 2869.36]  All the fun...
[2869.36 --> 2872.90]  You wouldn't download a screwdriver?
[2872.96 --> 2873.84]  Yes, you would!
[2876.72 --> 2877.78]  Oh, my goodness.
[2878.32 --> 2880.32]  The VPN money goes into a super pack?
[2880.52 --> 2880.80]  Yeah.
[2881.34 --> 2882.20]  Oh, no.
[2882.36 --> 2882.64]  Wow.
[2883.14 --> 2886.30]  I don't think we have super packs up here, but it doesn't matter.
[2886.42 --> 2887.24]  The point is...
[2887.24 --> 2887.46]  Oh, do we not?
[2887.58 --> 2887.94]  Yeah.
[2887.94 --> 2888.02]  Yeah.
[2888.22 --> 2888.64]  That makes sense.
[2888.64 --> 2889.66]  That's an American thing.
[2889.76 --> 2890.50]  That's probably good.
[2890.50 --> 2896.86]  The point is, it's time to explain and do a couple of merch messages here.
[2896.96 --> 2898.02]  We don't do super chats.
[2898.10 --> 2898.98]  We don't do Twitch bits.
[2899.10 --> 2902.94]  We do merch messages, because the way we see it, if you're going to huck money at your
[2902.94 --> 2909.96]  screen, you should darn well get something for it, like a water bottle or a screwdriver.
[2910.40 --> 2911.00]  Something cool.
[2911.04 --> 2911.50]  Oh, the ratchet.
[2911.68 --> 2912.58]  The ratchet's locked.
[2912.70 --> 2913.00]  Dang it.
[2913.24 --> 2913.38]  Okay.
[2913.78 --> 2914.06]  There.
[2914.18 --> 2914.94]  Or a screwdriver.
[2914.94 --> 2915.06]  Whatever.
[2917.32 --> 2921.98]  So, all you got to do is go to lttstore.com, and in the checkout, you are going to see...
[2921.98 --> 2922.64]  In the cart...
[2922.64 --> 2922.96]  Dang it.
[2923.02 --> 2924.40]  I've been doing really well lately.
[2924.64 --> 2928.26]  In the cart, you will see a box whenever we're live to leave a merch message.
[2929.16 --> 2930.98]  It'll go to producer Dan.
[2932.02 --> 2932.68]  Oh, sorry.
[2932.84 --> 2933.28]  There you go.
[2934.04 --> 2934.50]  And gone.
[2934.70 --> 2935.12]  No, sorry.
[2935.22 --> 2935.40]  Sorry.
[2935.48 --> 2936.28]  We'll try that one more time.
[2936.34 --> 2936.70]  Okay, wave.
[2936.82 --> 2937.76]  Okay, we'll get the timing right.
[2939.12 --> 2939.74]  Yeah, okay.
[2939.80 --> 2940.72]  I took too long that time.
[2940.72 --> 2941.16]  It doesn't matter.
[2941.24 --> 2944.44]  The point is, it'll go to producer Dan, who will check your message down here.
[2944.44 --> 2948.84]  Send you a little reply, or get your reply some other way, or curate your message for
[2948.84 --> 2953.40]  me and Luke, and often Dan, to talk about on the show later on.
[2953.96 --> 2954.98]  Why don't we do a couple?
[2955.08 --> 2956.12]  Show you guys how it works.
[2956.20 --> 2957.82]  Dan, do you have a couple merch messages for us?
[2957.90 --> 2958.10]  I do.
[2958.20 --> 2958.82]  I got a bunch here.
[2959.20 --> 2960.18]  Hey, LLND.
[2960.46 --> 2961.24]  Love the pins.
[2961.36 --> 2962.36]  Can't wait for more.
[2962.50 --> 2963.34]  Question for Linus.
[2963.68 --> 2966.98]  You did a video on autonomous lawnmowers a while back.
[2967.10 --> 2971.32]  Any updates on living with it, or was it a gimmicky waste of time?
[2971.32 --> 2976.04]  I wouldn't describe it as a waste of time, since the whole point is that it doesn't
[2976.04 --> 2981.74]  take as much time, but I would describe it as not a great use of money at the moment.
[2982.22 --> 2990.02]  I think that in that sponsored video, I feel like we did a pretty good job of showing the
[2990.02 --> 2995.18]  results, which I think allowed people to make decisions.
[2995.18 --> 2997.54]  You know, we read through the comments on that video.
[2997.64 --> 3002.00]  I'm always kind of looking for, I'm always kind of looking to make sure that our sponsored
[3002.00 --> 3007.60]  content hits all the beats that the sponsor asks for, while also not misrepresenting the
[3007.60 --> 3008.56]  product to our viewers.
[3008.78 --> 3012.66]  So we hit all the beats, and I read through the comments, and people had a pretty good
[3012.66 --> 3018.50]  understanding of how well things went, because we did a very real-world demonstration.
[3019.22 --> 3021.14]  And honestly, the sponsor was happy with that.
[3021.18 --> 3022.84]  They were actually really great to work with.
[3022.88 --> 3023.82]  We would work with them again.
[3023.82 --> 3030.94]  We showed a real-world result, where we real-world set it up, and real-world freaking ran it,
[3031.02 --> 3032.54]  and it did as well as it did.
[3032.84 --> 3038.54]  And for certain lawn configurations, I could see it being a time saver, and maybe even worth
[3038.54 --> 3038.90]  the money.
[3039.26 --> 3041.32]  For mine, not even close.
[3041.66 --> 3043.34]  It just didn't make sense.
[3043.74 --> 3047.72]  The lawn that we showed you guys in the video was actually at my old place.
[3049.46 --> 3051.62]  And it's just too irregularly shaped.
[3051.62 --> 3052.86]  It was a little odd.
[3052.96 --> 3054.10]  Do you think it would do better at your new one?
[3054.16 --> 3054.98]  I kind of feel like it would.
[3055.50 --> 3055.86]  Maybe.
[3057.26 --> 3058.10]  Definitely a maybe.
[3058.74 --> 3059.74]  Definitely maybe.
[3059.94 --> 3060.12]  Yeah.
[3060.50 --> 3060.78]  Yeah.
[3061.12 --> 3067.64]  But one of the challenges is that it's only really ideal if you have one contiguous lawn
[3067.64 --> 3068.06]  space.
[3068.06 --> 3075.62]  I have a super small front lawn, and then an extra super small, I don't know, 15 square
[3075.62 --> 3076.44]  feet or whatever.
[3076.78 --> 3082.84]  Like, little tiny sliver that if I don't mow, then the neighbors will be like, you.
[3084.30 --> 3088.42]  And in order to do that, I would have to pick up the thing and put it there, at which point
[3088.42 --> 3090.80]  I have to kind of ask myself, well, why am I bothering?
[3090.80 --> 3093.22]  I might as well just start up the lawnmower, right?
[3093.36 --> 3098.28]  So I don't know that I would do it at my current place either.
[3098.48 --> 3103.96]  I think that in another five to 10 years, we could reach a level of advancement in the
[3103.96 --> 3104.40]  mapping.
[3104.90 --> 3108.18]  And because you're not going to be able to go on just one alone.
[3108.50 --> 3110.68]  So I don't think you're going to get by on just vision.
[3110.94 --> 3112.72]  I don't think you're going to get by on just mapping.
[3112.90 --> 3115.82]  I think you need a perfect harmony of mapping and vision.
[3115.82 --> 3119.50]  And I think in another five to 10 years, we could get to the point where you'd have a
[3119.50 --> 3123.36]  product that's just press a button and it goes.
[3123.46 --> 3124.56]  You don't even think about it.
[3124.64 --> 3129.10]  But right now, I just don't see it as making sense.
[3130.54 --> 3133.74]  Someone's asking if I want to test the Husqvarna Robomower.
[3134.14 --> 3135.82]  Yeah, I saw enough.
[3135.96 --> 3137.16]  I saw enough so far.
[3137.40 --> 3140.18]  I just don't think it's there yet for me.
[3140.58 --> 3142.82]  If I had a super simple lawn, I could totally...
[3143.44 --> 3144.64]  Like the Langley house.
[3145.82 --> 3149.32]  That little like postcard size thing in the back.
[3149.50 --> 3149.82]  Yeah.
[3149.94 --> 3153.30]  If I just never had to think about that again in my life, I could see that being kind of
[3153.30 --> 3153.66]  practical.
[3153.78 --> 3154.78]  Then I get the upper stairs.
[3155.44 --> 3155.96]  Never mind.
[3156.06 --> 3156.78]  I forgot about the stairs.
[3157.04 --> 3157.22]  Nope.
[3157.34 --> 3157.66]  I take it back.
[3157.88 --> 3160.80]  There were stairs and then another small patch and then you still had the lawn in the front.
[3161.54 --> 3161.86]  Yeah.
[3161.92 --> 3162.38]  So it's like...
[3162.38 --> 3162.62]  I don't know.
[3162.80 --> 3163.52]  Vancouver, man.
[3163.64 --> 3166.46]  It's like rainy and rocky and slopey.
[3166.46 --> 3168.48]  I'm sure there's places where it would be better.
[3168.48 --> 3173.24]  Where like everything is flat and it's like a totally, you know, all at once developed
[3173.24 --> 3176.00]  suburb where everyone just has like a square lawn or whatever else.
[3176.40 --> 3178.30]  There's definitely places where it would work.
[3179.22 --> 3179.92]  It's not.
[3179.98 --> 3181.26]  It's not here and it's not for me.
[3182.62 --> 3183.06]  Okay.
[3183.18 --> 3183.70]  Dan, hit me.
[3183.70 --> 3185.18]  Hey, DLL.
[3185.50 --> 3188.28]  I entered a competition in a mall today.
[3188.48 --> 3193.64]  At the end of it, it redirected me to a full detailed table of every entry.
[3194.22 --> 3195.70]  Who would you report this to?
[3195.90 --> 3196.74]  Can't find the deb?
[3196.98 --> 3198.30]  Told the mall staff.
[3201.28 --> 3204.72]  It's definitely not legal.
[3205.82 --> 3207.38]  But I have...
[3207.38 --> 3207.86]  That's it.
[3208.56 --> 3211.18]  I don't think we've ever talked about this on the show before.
[3211.18 --> 3219.66]  Something that is illegal, but how difficult it is to report something like this.
[3219.72 --> 3220.68]  Who does it go to?
[3220.76 --> 3221.38]  Who would care?
[3222.06 --> 3223.68]  If you were to what?
[3223.82 --> 3224.76]  Like call your local...
[3224.76 --> 3225.72]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[3225.86 --> 3226.06]  Yeah.
[3226.32 --> 3228.98]  Maybe we have to go back into the wording because is it illegal?
[3228.98 --> 3233.52]  Like was this person sent this stuff or did they find a way to gain access to it?
[3233.52 --> 3237.02]  At the end, it redirected them to a full detailed table of every entry.
[3237.20 --> 3237.64]  Whoa.
[3237.96 --> 3238.74]  Yeah, super bad.
[3239.52 --> 3240.82]  It's probably not intentional.
[3241.18 --> 3244.22]  But that doesn't change the fact that you actually cannot do that.
[3244.70 --> 3244.92]  Yeah.
[3246.66 --> 3247.10]  Sheesh.
[3247.46 --> 3248.10]  But I don't know.
[3248.12 --> 3248.22]  I know.
[3248.38 --> 3252.72]  I suspect if that was in Canada, I could figure it out.
[3253.92 --> 3254.78]  It is in Canada.
[3254.98 --> 3256.42]  Someone found it for the UK.
[3256.68 --> 3261.86]  I suspect if it's in Canada, I would look up the CanSpam organization, whatever.
[3262.60 --> 3267.28]  And I bet you if they were the wrong group of people that they could get you to the right
[3267.28 --> 3268.62]  group of people relatively quickly.
[3269.62 --> 3271.88]  Because I suspect it would be a related group.
[3272.02 --> 3272.24]  Yeah.
[3272.28 --> 3273.12]  If you can't find the dev.
[3273.16 --> 3273.90]  I mean, I don't know.
[3273.98 --> 3275.28]  I don't have too much detail.
[3275.64 --> 3280.80]  So I don't know if this was a pop-up kiosk where they filled out a survey and then it's
[3280.80 --> 3281.08]  gone.
[3281.28 --> 3281.52]  Yeah.
[3281.52 --> 3288.18]  Or if it's like part of the navigation touchscreens that they have in some malls now.
[3288.42 --> 3291.22]  And after you navigated, maybe it's a little survey or something like that.
[3291.26 --> 3292.24]  Maybe it's a permanent fixture.
[3292.56 --> 3297.66]  If it's a permanent fixture, I think that there's a solid chance that you can pin down the mall
[3297.66 --> 3299.02]  for being responsible for it.
[3299.02 --> 3305.10]  But if it wasn't the mall itself who's running the thing, I mean, good luck.
[3305.24 --> 3310.28]  I appreciate you trying to do your civic duty and get it sorted out somehow.
[3310.28 --> 3313.12]  Because obviously this shouldn't stand as it is.
[3313.26 --> 3316.02]  But I'm going to be honest with you.
[3316.18 --> 3318.28]  I would probably...
[3318.28 --> 3322.30]  I would try to contact the dev before I did anything else personally.
[3322.42 --> 3324.06]  I would probably reach out to the mall first.
[3324.38 --> 3324.92]  I would...
[3324.92 --> 3325.20]  So yeah.
[3325.42 --> 3326.08]  Who were those guys?
[3326.08 --> 3326.28]  Yeah.
[3326.28 --> 3329.78]  If you can't find the dev, I would reach out to the mall and I personally...
[3329.78 --> 3330.66]  Well, they did that.
[3330.72 --> 3331.56]  They told the mall staff.
[3331.68 --> 3331.74]  Sorry.
[3331.74 --> 3332.30]  I missed that part.
[3332.32 --> 3333.86]  I personally would not just tell them.
[3334.14 --> 3339.00]  I would more or less demand to know who it was because I would not trust whoever I told
[3339.00 --> 3339.94]  to actually follow through with them.
[3339.94 --> 3340.08]  Yeah.
[3340.10 --> 3340.48]  That's fair.
[3340.78 --> 3343.48]  And then I would make sure that I could get in contact with the dev and then give them
[3343.48 --> 3344.72]  the opportunity to fix it.
[3347.42 --> 3349.26]  I mean, it's very likely they don't even know.
[3350.12 --> 3350.44]  Yeah.
[3351.20 --> 3352.54]  That wouldn't surprise me at all.
[3352.54 --> 3355.98]  So make sure that they at least know and have the opportunity to fix it.
[3356.08 --> 3356.24]  First.
[3357.28 --> 3358.90]  But yeah, that sucks.
[3360.02 --> 3360.62]  Next one.
[3362.98 --> 3363.52]  Oh yeah.
[3363.58 --> 3364.04]  Want to pick one?
[3364.48 --> 3365.72]  Wasn't that only one merch message?
[3366.00 --> 3366.14]  No.
[3366.84 --> 3367.24]  One more.
[3367.86 --> 3369.00]  Oh, that was a merch message.
[3369.44 --> 3370.72]  Is that Jessica?
[3371.64 --> 3372.04]  Oh.
[3372.22 --> 3372.44]  Oh.
[3372.44 --> 3372.64]  Hello.
[3372.86 --> 3374.80]  Are you still here?
[3375.20 --> 3375.48]  Because...
[3375.48 --> 3377.00]  No, I have comedy business in Surrey.
[3377.08 --> 3378.68]  You have comedy business in Surrey.
[3378.78 --> 3380.08]  I don't have another place to be.
[3380.12 --> 3380.96]  Comedy business.
[3380.96 --> 3383.18]  I mean, is that a...
[3383.18 --> 3386.74]  What's the word for the contradictory thing?
[3387.12 --> 3388.02]  You would know that.
[3388.48 --> 3388.84]  Oxymoron.
[3389.22 --> 3389.58]  Oxymoron.
[3389.64 --> 3390.12]  No, there's a...
[3390.12 --> 3391.18]  I think there's a different one.
[3392.02 --> 3393.26]  It might be an oxymoron.
[3393.34 --> 3394.34]  I think it's oxymoron.
[3396.04 --> 3399.88]  Oxymoron versus contradiction, antithesis, paradox, paradox...
[3399.88 --> 3400.76]  Yeah, oxymoron.
[3400.78 --> 3401.14]  That's the one.
[3401.22 --> 3401.62]  Hey, thanks.
[3401.64 --> 3402.22]  You must be a writer.
[3402.74 --> 3404.86]  Okay, well, why don't we do your bit, then?
[3405.76 --> 3406.96]  I would love if we did my bit.
[3407.34 --> 3407.70]  Okay.
[3408.78 --> 3409.60]  Can I be audible?
[3410.74 --> 3412.14]  Yeah, why don't you take Dan's spot?
[3412.40 --> 3413.08]  Dan doesn't need it.
[3413.42 --> 3414.52]  Get out of the way, Dan.
[3415.16 --> 3415.44]  Wow.
[3415.80 --> 3418.00]  I mean, you don't have to be mean about it, but...
[3418.00 --> 3418.40]  Move, Dan.
[3418.56 --> 3419.44]  Get out the way.
[3420.22 --> 3421.28]  It is I, Shadow Dan.
[3423.46 --> 3423.78]  Okay.
[3424.08 --> 3425.40]  What is this again?
[3425.78 --> 3426.08]  All right.
[3426.10 --> 3426.54]  I have no idea.
[3426.54 --> 3429.16]  So, I have created a very fun game for you both.
[3429.28 --> 3430.36]  I hope it will be fun.
[3430.44 --> 3431.40]  I put you on camera, by the way.
[3431.40 --> 3435.82]  I got some perfectly normal products off of Wish.com's tech section.
[3436.18 --> 3436.52]  Okay.
[3436.74 --> 3439.58]  And seeing as you are a renowned tech-spert...
[3439.58 --> 3441.68]  Which of us are you talking to?
[3441.74 --> 3442.30]  Surely him.
[3442.98 --> 3443.64]  Both of you.
[3444.46 --> 3445.32]  More so than me.
[3445.98 --> 3450.04]  So, you and Luke will obviously be able to guess the purpose of these products.
[3450.80 --> 3453.22]  Wait, have you been on WAN Show on video yet?
[3453.36 --> 3453.92]  I don't think so.
[3453.92 --> 3454.20]  I have not.
[3454.50 --> 3454.62]  Okay.
[3454.62 --> 3456.80]  Well, briefly during the expo.
[3457.20 --> 3457.74]  Okay, cool.
[3457.92 --> 3459.62]  So, this is Jessica.
[3459.92 --> 3460.18]  Hi.
[3460.18 --> 3461.48]  Okay.
[3461.68 --> 3462.84]  She's writing for the WAN Show.
[3462.96 --> 3464.54]  She produces the doc.
[3464.76 --> 3465.00]  Yeah.
[3465.18 --> 3466.50]  Along with Riley, I believe.
[3467.02 --> 3467.22]  Yeah.
[3467.80 --> 3468.10]  Okay.
[3468.32 --> 3469.10]  And so, sorry.
[3469.18 --> 3469.92]  Wait, what are we doing?
[3470.26 --> 3471.20]  I'm giving you...
[3471.20 --> 3472.30]  You're having a game.
[3472.38 --> 3473.42]  There's no notes about it.
[3473.50 --> 3473.72]  Oh.
[3473.96 --> 3474.60]  I can't...
[3474.60 --> 3476.58]  Stop searching.
[3476.80 --> 3477.66]  I look through it for notes as well.
[3477.66 --> 3479.24]  She's watching me look for the notes as well.
[3479.50 --> 3479.90]  Okay.
[3480.04 --> 3480.34]  All right.
[3480.38 --> 3480.60]  Fine.
[3480.60 --> 3482.50]  The notes are a reflection of my vision.
[3482.64 --> 3483.72]  Stop looking in there.
[3483.72 --> 3484.72]  Okay.
[3484.72 --> 3484.84]  Okay.
[3484.84 --> 3486.90]  So, the rules are as such.
[3487.02 --> 3490.64]  You are trying to guess the advertised purpose of these products.
[3490.64 --> 3491.08]  Oh, no.
[3491.84 --> 3493.36]  Not what they look like they're for.
[3493.52 --> 3496.16]  What someone tried to convince me to do with them.
[3497.38 --> 3499.82]  And you may ask me yes or no questions.
[3499.82 --> 3502.98]  And I will only confirm if you are correct or incorrect.
[3503.90 --> 3504.22]  Okay.
[3504.22 --> 3505.90]  And you may ask me how to turn them on.
[3505.90 --> 3508.78]  Because some of them are confusing.
[3508.98 --> 3509.34]  Okay.
[3509.48 --> 3509.90]  All right.
[3510.20 --> 3511.90]  And are we competing or...
[3512.64 --> 3513.72]  You can if you want.
[3513.94 --> 3514.12]  Sure.
[3515.24 --> 3515.98]  Team effort.
[3516.24 --> 3516.92]  Team effort.
[3517.02 --> 3519.50]  I think the vibe I'm getting is we're not going to get any of these.
[3519.62 --> 3520.18]  Oh, okay.
[3520.36 --> 3520.46]  I think...
[3520.46 --> 3521.62]  You probably will get some of them.
[3521.64 --> 3521.94]  Okay.
[3522.08 --> 3522.32]  Okay.
[3522.38 --> 3523.44]  So, this is number one.
[3525.06 --> 3525.74]  I see.
[3526.66 --> 3528.04]  So, it's a clip-on light?
[3528.84 --> 3529.72]  Oh, okay.
[3530.10 --> 3530.82]  Well, okay.
[3530.88 --> 3532.26]  I know what this is.
[3532.26 --> 3536.96]  It's a telephoto lens that you clip onto the back of your phone.
[3537.18 --> 3542.14]  So, that you can magnify your camera.
[3542.34 --> 3545.32]  But you told me that these are going to be non-obvious.
[3545.56 --> 3545.66]  Yeah.
[3546.18 --> 3547.36]  We're starting easy.
[3547.70 --> 3548.50]  What is it?
[3548.56 --> 3550.44]  Like a gynecology tool?
[3550.58 --> 3550.74]  No.
[3550.84 --> 3551.52]  You got it in one.
[3552.08 --> 3554.76]  It is, in fact, intended to clip onto the back of a phone.
[3555.32 --> 3556.24]  It doesn't work.
[3556.86 --> 3557.10]  Oh.
[3558.78 --> 3560.38]  Well, can I...
[3560.38 --> 3561.46]  Can I...
[3561.46 --> 3562.54]  Wait, so we got it right, though.
[3562.66 --> 3563.08]  Oh, okay.
[3563.20 --> 3564.36]  So, do we get a point for that?
[3564.44 --> 3565.02]  You get a point.
[3565.08 --> 3565.28]  Okay.
[3565.36 --> 3565.82]  Go team.
[3566.26 --> 3566.68]  Go team.
[3566.70 --> 3567.98]  Can I try to use it?
[3568.04 --> 3568.16]  Yeah.
[3568.16 --> 3570.26]  I mean, is that a thing that's part of this game?
[3570.44 --> 3570.68]  Sure.
[3570.76 --> 3570.90]  Go for it.
[3570.90 --> 3573.06]  So, I got my Note 9 here.
[3573.26 --> 3574.52]  Trusty Note 9.
[3574.96 --> 3575.14]  Okay.
[3575.16 --> 3575.60]  Hold on a second.
[3575.76 --> 3576.32]  Let's just look.
[3576.64 --> 3579.52]  Let's just use my eyeball to...
[3579.52 --> 3580.68]  Does this even...
[3580.68 --> 3582.64]  Does this even allow light through it?
[3583.62 --> 3584.56]  There's a cap on it.
[3585.00 --> 3585.20]  No.
[3585.28 --> 3585.86]  No, there isn't.
[3585.86 --> 3587.34]  It does allow light, but not much.
[3587.92 --> 3588.28]  Okay.
[3588.48 --> 3589.44]  One moment, please.
[3591.46 --> 3593.46]  Um...
[3593.46 --> 3595.46]  Oh, goodness.
[3601.46 --> 3605.64]  I don't think anything could be more trash if it tried.
[3605.64 --> 3609.78]  I mean, it technically functions, but that's the worst.
[3610.16 --> 3610.90]  That's the worst.
[3611.08 --> 3611.22]  Okay.
[3611.38 --> 3611.66]  So, here.
[3611.74 --> 3612.34]  Hold on a second.
[3612.52 --> 3614.06]  Let's go to the loot cam.
[3614.50 --> 3614.68]  Yeah.
[3614.68 --> 3616.36]  And then let's look at...
[3616.36 --> 3618.86]  Look at my pores.
[3619.06 --> 3619.68]  Let's look at...
[3620.68 --> 3621.36]  Oh, my.
[3621.98 --> 3622.30]  Okay.
[3622.56 --> 3623.04]  Yeah.
[3623.14 --> 3624.34]  So, that's how blurry it is.
[3624.70 --> 3629.12]  I might as well have just taken a photo and then enhanced.
[3629.66 --> 3629.86]  Yeah.
[3630.00 --> 3631.60]  It would be probably less blurry.
[3631.78 --> 3633.60]  And before you ask, yes.
[3634.10 --> 3635.16]  Yes, it's aligned.
[3635.16 --> 3639.70]  And actually, it took him a bit to align it.
[3639.70 --> 3641.38]  They suggest taking pictures of the moon.
[3642.36 --> 3643.28]  I mean...
[3643.28 --> 3643.52]  Oh, you know what?
[3643.52 --> 3645.08]  If you want to see a gray circle...
[3645.08 --> 3645.42]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[3645.48 --> 3646.00]  Hold on, hold on.
[3646.04 --> 3646.94]  There's a focus wheel.
[3647.76 --> 3648.86]  There's a focus wheel.
[3649.26 --> 3649.66]  Oh.
[3650.48 --> 3651.56]  That's pretty good.
[3652.36 --> 3654.12]  I mean, well, good is a really...
[3654.12 --> 3655.28]  From here, my eyes are bad.
[3655.48 --> 3657.42]  Good is a really strong word, Luke.
[3658.16 --> 3658.68]  But...
[3658.68 --> 3659.68]  How much was this?
[3660.62 --> 3661.94]  I like less than $5.
[3662.70 --> 3663.06]  Okay.
[3663.24 --> 3663.66]  Hold on.
[3663.88 --> 3664.30]  Hold on.
[3664.40 --> 3666.12]  I've got a comparison shot for you guys.
[3666.60 --> 3666.82]  Okay.
[3666.90 --> 3668.68]  So, here's...
[3670.26 --> 3670.60]  Okay.
[3670.66 --> 3671.22]  Hold on, hold on.
[3671.30 --> 3671.48]  Okay.
[3671.54 --> 3672.40]  So, I've got Dan.
[3672.60 --> 3675.68]  You got normal zoom and then do like omega zoom just through the phone.
[3675.78 --> 3676.54]  I don't have that.
[3676.60 --> 3676.86]  Okay.
[3677.30 --> 3677.66]  Okay.
[3678.50 --> 3679.50]  So, oh, no.
[3679.62 --> 3680.44]  This is not good.
[3680.76 --> 3681.06]  Okay.
[3681.08 --> 3682.24]  We're going back to the loot cam.
[3682.24 --> 3683.18]  This is not...
[3683.18 --> 3684.08]  This is not good.
[3685.16 --> 3685.56]  Okay.
[3685.84 --> 3687.24]  So, here...
[3687.24 --> 3691.30]  Here is Dan with the attachment.
[3692.96 --> 3693.44]  Okay.
[3693.72 --> 3698.14]  And I've realized this is not the best way for us to evaluate something like this.
[3698.24 --> 3700.58]  You guys looking through a camera at a tiny little...
[3700.58 --> 3701.94]  Well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[3702.16 --> 3702.54]  Okay.
[3702.80 --> 3709.38]  So, here is Dan with my Note 9, which is not a particularly modern phone.
[3710.00 --> 3710.34]  Okay.
[3711.48 --> 3713.46]  Just, you know, enhanced.
[3713.94 --> 3714.80]  So, here's my...
[3714.80 --> 3715.40]  Here's my...
[3715.40 --> 3715.92]  Stop.
[3715.92 --> 3716.00]  Stop.
[3716.42 --> 3717.66]  Can you just...
[3717.66 --> 3718.40]  Bubble, go away.
[3718.50 --> 3718.74]  Stop.
[3718.88 --> 3719.08]  Okay.
[3719.28 --> 3719.72]  Rotate.
[3719.86 --> 3720.26]  Thank you.
[3720.64 --> 3720.88]  Okay.
[3720.98 --> 3724.44]  So, here is Dan just digitally enhanced.
[3725.62 --> 3726.06]  Enhance.
[3726.90 --> 3727.28]  Enhance.
[3727.40 --> 3727.68]  Yeah.
[3728.14 --> 3728.40]  Yeah.
[3728.40 --> 3729.04]  It's way better.
[3729.12 --> 3729.24]  Yeah.
[3729.30 --> 3729.98]  That is...
[3729.98 --> 3730.30]  Wow.
[3730.42 --> 3731.04]  That is...
[3731.04 --> 3736.18]  That is just obviously, clearly, immediately, obviously better.
[3736.62 --> 3741.28]  This is literal manufactured garbage and whoever made it should be ashamed of themselves.
[3742.52 --> 3742.96]  Okay.
[3743.30 --> 3743.90]  Item two?
[3743.90 --> 3744.98]  Yeah.
[3745.78 --> 3746.30]  All right.
[3746.36 --> 3746.68]  Hit me.
[3746.88 --> 3747.52]  What is this?
[3748.04 --> 3749.94]  Dan is big foot.
[3750.52 --> 3751.00]  So, okay.
[3751.08 --> 3753.22]  It's going to turn on and those are going to spin.
[3753.50 --> 3754.86]  So, like helicopter style.
[3755.30 --> 3755.96]  I mean, sure.
[3757.66 --> 3758.02]  Okay.
[3760.02 --> 3760.38]  Okay.
[3760.48 --> 3760.96]  You know what?
[3761.18 --> 3761.62]  You know what?
[3762.00 --> 3762.38]  I have a theory for this.
[3762.38 --> 3764.64]  This doesn't have to be a competition, but I do have a theory.
[3764.84 --> 3765.00]  I have a theory.
[3765.00 --> 3765.96]  Don't hide it behind me.
[3766.18 --> 3766.50]  Okay.
[3766.50 --> 3768.74]  Oh, yeah.
[3768.84 --> 3769.04]  Sorry.
[3769.12 --> 3769.28]  Okay.
[3769.34 --> 3770.58]  So, this is what it does.
[3770.68 --> 3771.14]  I'm just going to...
[3771.14 --> 3771.20]  Here.
[3771.28 --> 3772.62]  We'll put it on the top of our laptops.
[3772.72 --> 3774.38]  That'll work perfectly and nothing could go wrong.
[3774.72 --> 3774.96]  Yeah.
[3777.12 --> 3779.28]  It looks like you're wearing one of those little hats.
[3780.28 --> 3780.94]  Get in there.
[3781.16 --> 3781.88]  I'm a wizard.
[3786.24 --> 3786.56]  Okay.
[3786.82 --> 3787.76]  I have mine written down.
[3787.88 --> 3788.18]  Okay.
[3788.18 --> 3790.22]  Do you want to go first?
[3790.52 --> 3790.70]  Sure.
[3790.76 --> 3792.12]  I said desktop hand cooler.
[3792.54 --> 3793.98]  I said air purifier.
[3794.44 --> 3794.70]  Oh.
[3794.82 --> 3795.84]  Wrong and wrong.
[3796.04 --> 3798.54]  I mean, I don't know what this...
[3798.54 --> 3803.64]  If it's just supposed to enhance air circulation or something like that, then I could...
[3803.64 --> 3806.38]  You could sort of make an argument, but I just...
[3806.38 --> 3806.86]  How does it feel?
[3807.16 --> 3807.62]  It doesn't...
[3807.62 --> 3808.00]  No, it doesn't...
[3808.00 --> 3808.66]  They're not angled.
[3808.92 --> 3810.04]  So, it's not a fan.
[3810.76 --> 3814.26]  It just moves it around, which is why I thought maybe it was like a...
[3814.26 --> 3819.16]  Like a FACO pseudoscience medicine purifier or something, but okay.
[3819.28 --> 3819.50]  Fine.
[3819.70 --> 3819.88]  Fine.
[3820.14 --> 3821.46]  I do have one of those.
[3821.86 --> 3822.26]  Okay.
[3822.30 --> 3822.58]  Hold on.
[3822.60 --> 3822.82]  Hold on.
[3822.88 --> 3823.12]  Hold on.
[3823.16 --> 3823.40]  Hold on.
[3823.44 --> 3823.70]  Hold on.
[3823.72 --> 3824.74]  Give me a little bit longer here.
[3825.84 --> 3827.66]  Literally no markings on it whatsoever.
[3827.66 --> 3829.48]  Did you remove labels and markings?
[3829.94 --> 3833.68]  I removed a marking from one thing's packaging, but otherwise, no.
[3834.04 --> 3836.82]  It came exactly like that spinny obelisk.
[3836.82 --> 3837.30]  I honestly...
[3837.30 --> 3838.38]  I thought I had it.
[3838.48 --> 3841.24]  I got people saying maybe it takes out insects.
[3842.44 --> 3843.14]  I don't know.
[3843.14 --> 3843.50]  Really?
[3843.70 --> 3844.08]  I doubt it.
[3844.08 --> 3844.46]  No, no, no.
[3844.50 --> 3844.78]  Hold on.
[3845.08 --> 3845.72]  Laundry rack.
[3845.78 --> 3845.96]  Okay.
[3846.12 --> 3846.52]  Stop.
[3846.62 --> 3847.84]  Why am I even looking at Twitch chat?
[3848.26 --> 3849.86]  Let's look at the 5G blocker.
[3849.90 --> 3850.16]  Okay.
[3850.22 --> 3852.06]  We've clearly jumped the shark at this point.
[3852.22 --> 3854.72]  Hey, someone flipping chat said motion sensor trigger.
[3854.90 --> 3855.68]  You might need that.
[3858.78 --> 3860.06]  Motion sensor trigger.
[3860.50 --> 3861.02]  Does it...
[3861.02 --> 3862.92]  His house with his junky lights.
[3863.26 --> 3864.42]  Does it...
[3864.42 --> 3864.70]  Oh.
[3865.66 --> 3866.24]  Thanks for that.
[3866.88 --> 3868.38]  My lights often turn off.
[3869.82 --> 3870.58]  On that...
[3870.58 --> 3870.74]  Okay.
[3870.74 --> 3873.12]  Maybe it's something for work from home.
[3873.92 --> 3878.52]  Like maybe it just moves in your webcam and makes your employer think you're sitting at your desk.
[3878.88 --> 3879.20]  Okay.
[3879.30 --> 3879.66]  You know what?
[3879.68 --> 3880.12]  I don't know.
[3880.22 --> 3880.66]  Okay, Jessica.
[3880.82 --> 3881.74]  But it's battery powered.
[3881.82 --> 3882.58]  It would run out of batteries.
[3882.64 --> 3883.72]  It doesn't even have a wall plug.
[3883.72 --> 3884.00]  Yeah.
[3884.00 --> 3886.38]  Sadly, I must give a point to Twitch chat.
[3886.62 --> 3888.82]  It is in fact intended to keep bugs off of food.
[3889.36 --> 3889.76]  Whoa.
[3892.96 --> 3893.44]  Oh.
[3895.44 --> 3895.84]  Okay.
[3896.88 --> 3897.24]  Uh.
[3897.86 --> 3898.26]  Really?
[3898.26 --> 3899.10]  Go Twitch chat.
[3899.58 --> 3899.86]  Apparently.
[3900.50 --> 3901.06]  For picnics.
[3901.72 --> 3902.10]  Okay.
[3902.30 --> 3902.76]  All right.
[3902.90 --> 3903.30]  You know what?
[3903.34 --> 3904.56]  Put a thing over it.
[3904.56 --> 3905.56]  Well...
[3905.56 --> 3911.24]  I mean, why do that when you could buy half a dozen of these and have them all over your table to whack your hands?
[3913.24 --> 3914.82]  Someone said they work well.
[3915.00 --> 3917.04]  But why don't you just put something over it?
[3917.06 --> 3917.40]  Okay.
[3917.50 --> 3917.88]  All right.
[3917.98 --> 3918.34]  Okay.
[3918.56 --> 3919.18]  What's next?
[3919.18 --> 3921.66]  Actually, multiple people are saying they work well.
[3923.66 --> 3926.10]  It's the only one of these products I would actually use.
[3926.58 --> 3926.72]  Oh.
[3926.90 --> 3927.18]  Okay.
[3927.36 --> 3927.68]  All right.
[3927.74 --> 3928.08]  Hit me.
[3928.08 --> 3936.34]  Okay.
[3937.98 --> 3939.72]  Let me just hold this up for you guys.
[3940.44 --> 3941.92]  It's clearly an LED.
[3942.20 --> 3942.36]  Yeah.
[3942.42 --> 3943.38]  LED on like a cable thing?
[3943.38 --> 3944.66]  At the end of a...
[3944.66 --> 3945.92]  At the end of a...
[3945.92 --> 3947.66]  Is that like a pinch clip or something?
[3948.04 --> 3948.44]  Thing.
[3948.90 --> 3949.62]  Pinch clip.
[3949.78 --> 3950.14]  Like, wait.
[3950.16 --> 3950.90]  What's the box?
[3950.96 --> 3951.98]  Is it just batteries?
[3952.26 --> 3952.68]  Nothing else?
[3953.28 --> 3955.62]  This appears to be a motion sensor.
[3956.34 --> 3956.74]  Okay.
[3956.94 --> 3957.32]  On the back.
[3957.32 --> 3957.52]  Correct.
[3957.52 --> 3957.88]  Okay.
[3958.08 --> 3960.08]  But I...
[3961.28 --> 3962.08]  See, it's...
[3962.08 --> 3962.64]  It's...
[3962.64 --> 3964.24]  A light went on when I did that.
[3964.90 --> 3965.58]  I thought...
[3965.58 --> 3966.42]  Did a light go on?
[3966.60 --> 3968.00]  It'll also turn on if you set it down.
[3968.50 --> 3969.64]  If I set it down?
[3969.64 --> 3970.74]  How do I set it down?
[3970.82 --> 3972.48]  It doesn't have an obvious...
[3972.48 --> 3973.24]  It doesn't have...
[3973.24 --> 3974.32]  If you set it down on its face.
[3974.34 --> 3974.56]  Wait.
[3974.82 --> 3975.14]  Wait.
[3975.44 --> 3975.80]  No.
[3976.08 --> 3976.76]  No way.
[3976.94 --> 3977.34]  No way.
[3977.50 --> 3978.90]  You put it on the top of your...
[3978.90 --> 3982.52]  You put it on the top of your bed and then it's a reading light.
[3982.58 --> 3982.86]  No, wait.
[3982.90 --> 3984.48]  Because the motion sensor would be facing up.
[3984.56 --> 3984.68]  Okay.
[3984.72 --> 3985.10]  Now, hold on.
[3985.14 --> 3986.10]  Just a gosh darn second here.
[3986.10 --> 3988.02]  Uh...
[3988.02 --> 3988.80]  Hold on.
[3988.90 --> 3989.46]  Set it...
[3989.46 --> 3990.58]  How do I set it down?
[3990.66 --> 3991.14]  I don't...
[3991.14 --> 3991.34]  Here.
[3991.48 --> 3991.66]  Okay.
[3991.70 --> 3993.02]  Here's why I'm so confused.
[3994.36 --> 3994.56]  Because...
[3994.56 --> 3996.60]  This side...
[3996.60 --> 3996.92]  See?
[3997.08 --> 3998.20]  This side is curvilerved.
[3998.44 --> 4000.12]  So this is clearly not the bottom.
[4000.78 --> 4002.14]  This side is flat.
[4002.38 --> 4002.62]  Right?
[4002.84 --> 4003.80]  We got a flat side.
[4004.10 --> 4005.10]  But this is not...
[4005.10 --> 4006.46]  Don't worry about it.
[4006.46 --> 4007.50]  But this side...
[4007.50 --> 4008.34]  But it has this...
[4008.34 --> 4008.90]  Like...
[4008.90 --> 4010.08]  Thing sticking out of it.
[4010.40 --> 4011.74]  So unless it...
[4011.74 --> 4013.90]  Hangs off of the edge of something...
[4013.90 --> 4015.04]  It hangs off the edge of something.
[4015.62 --> 4016.48]  But it doesn't...
[4016.48 --> 4016.64]  Here.
[4016.72 --> 4017.26]  One sec.
[4017.52 --> 4017.92]  Can we...
[4017.92 --> 4018.82]  She said put it down.
[4018.88 --> 4019.36]  Is it on?
[4019.62 --> 4020.74]  How do I put it down?
[4021.70 --> 4022.38]  I mean...
[4022.38 --> 4023.74]  Well, you can't...
[4023.74 --> 4025.20]  I know chat can't see it there.
[4025.22 --> 4025.88]  People can't even see it there.
[4025.88 --> 4027.38]  But I want to see if it was even going to work.
[4028.38 --> 4028.82]  It has...
[4028.82 --> 4029.06]  Okay.
[4029.42 --> 4031.66]  You said we could ask you how to turn it on, right?
[4031.84 --> 4032.02]  Yep.
[4032.46 --> 4033.12]  How do we turn it on?
[4033.16 --> 4034.68]  Set it down on its bulbous fucking...
[4034.68 --> 4034.90]  Sorry.
[4035.34 --> 4036.00]  Bulbous face.
[4036.46 --> 4037.78]  On its face?
[4038.02 --> 4038.92]  On its face.
[4039.16 --> 4039.40]  What?
[4039.96 --> 4041.08]  That can't possibly...
[4041.08 --> 4041.56]  It will turn on.
[4041.76 --> 4042.00]  Wait.
[4042.64 --> 4043.44]  But it...
[4043.44 --> 4045.50]  Is it when it rocks back and forth?
[4045.50 --> 4045.52]  Is it a light sensor?
[4045.96 --> 4046.80]  It has a light sensor.
[4047.58 --> 4048.04]  Why would you...
[4048.04 --> 4050.36]  That's why she said if you put it down, it turns it on.
[4050.42 --> 4051.76]  Because you're covering the light sensor.
[4052.18 --> 4055.12]  So that's not actually how you place it when you're practically using it, I think.
[4055.24 --> 4057.80]  So where on earth would you put this?
[4058.24 --> 4060.38]  So when it's dark, it turns on.
[4061.64 --> 4062.04]  Why?
[4062.54 --> 4064.40]  Is it for the reading thing that I said?
[4064.40 --> 4065.34]  Or is it something...
[4065.34 --> 4065.74]  It's not for reading.
[4065.74 --> 4066.46]  Oh, it's not for...
[4066.46 --> 4066.86]  There we go.
[4066.86 --> 4067.46]  Wait, it's just a little...
[4067.46 --> 4068.32]  Okay, so it was off.
[4068.36 --> 4069.32]  You have to press the button there.
[4069.44 --> 4071.36]  Now if I do this, the light turns on.
[4072.18 --> 4072.92]  And it's very...
[4072.92 --> 4073.20]  It's a blue light.
[4073.20 --> 4074.74]  Very not bright.
[4074.78 --> 4076.02]  Yeah, it's not bright at all.
[4076.14 --> 4078.04]  And it's blue or teal or something.
[4078.12 --> 4079.06]  So danger!
[4079.28 --> 4079.66]  Danger!
[4079.80 --> 4080.70]  Your light is off!
[4080.70 --> 4084.38]  I can tell the f***ing lights off because it's dark!
[4085.46 --> 4087.34]  Okay, now hold on just a gosh darn second.
[4088.02 --> 4089.42]  Wait, blue toilet light?
[4089.76 --> 4089.92]  Whoa!
[4089.92 --> 4090.18]  No.
[4090.72 --> 4092.44]  No, that can't be right.
[4092.54 --> 4093.54]  Shut up, chat.
[4094.68 --> 4095.62]  Motion sensor toilet.
[4095.76 --> 4096.28]  Toilet bowl light?
[4096.28 --> 4097.70]  It went green for a second.
[4097.80 --> 4098.68]  Wait, toilet bowl light?
[4099.04 --> 4101.82]  It is in fact a motion sensor toilet night light.
[4101.82 --> 4104.24]  So for bathroom, I think, though.
[4104.30 --> 4105.32]  Not the toilet itself.
[4105.34 --> 4106.42]  It hangs off of your toilet.
[4106.96 --> 4108.44]  And it makes your toilet glow.
[4110.14 --> 4111.78]  Wouldn't it get, like, pee on it?
[4111.78 --> 4112.30]  Really gross?
[4112.44 --> 4112.74]  Wouldn't it...
[4112.74 --> 4113.82]  There's nothing to keep it there.
[4113.82 --> 4115.36]  It hasn't been used, if that helps.
[4115.44 --> 4116.28]  It's gonna fall in.
[4118.58 --> 4119.76]  Like, it's green now.
[4120.66 --> 4122.88]  Yeah, it goes under the seat onto the toilet bowl.
[4123.40 --> 4124.14]  That is...
[4124.14 --> 4125.00]  Under the seat.
[4125.10 --> 4125.38]  Terrible.
[4125.38 --> 4128.12]  But then your seat's gonna be rocking onto one side.
[4128.26 --> 4128.94]  You hang it.
[4129.22 --> 4130.60]  Like, you bend the thingy.
[4130.60 --> 4132.76]  And the light points in.
[4132.86 --> 4133.04]  Oh.
[4133.56 --> 4135.34]  And the battery part is on the outside.
[4135.46 --> 4136.44]  It goes like this.
[4137.72 --> 4138.24]  I hate it.
[4138.46 --> 4139.50]  I hate everything about it.
[4139.70 --> 4142.28]  So this is on the outside of the toilet bowl.
[4142.32 --> 4142.72]  Why would I want...
[4142.72 --> 4144.20]  This is on the inside of the toilet bowl.
[4144.28 --> 4144.46]  No, no.
[4144.66 --> 4145.52]  Why would I want the...
[4145.52 --> 4147.16]  And then you can inspect your legendary peeps.
[4147.16 --> 4150.06]  Why would I want the nighttime light in my bathroom
[4150.06 --> 4152.26]  to glow out of my toilet bowl?
[4152.80 --> 4155.52]  That's gonna be covered by my giant white butt.
[4155.64 --> 4156.32]  You gotta send...
[4156.32 --> 4157.52]  Like, that's not useful.
[4157.52 --> 4159.46]  You gotta send pictures of your...
[4159.46 --> 4161.88]  Of your poetry-worthy poops to your partner.
[4163.18 --> 4164.76]  In various colors.
[4164.94 --> 4165.78]  Sometimes blue.
[4167.02 --> 4167.38]  Sometimes...
[4167.38 --> 4168.78]  I think it would be very aesthetic.
[4169.88 --> 4170.96]  Instagram would love it.
[4171.06 --> 4171.28]  You could be aesthetic?
[4172.00 --> 4173.02]  You could write a Twitter bot.
[4174.04 --> 4175.72]  It often just doesn't work.
[4175.80 --> 4176.32]  I hate it.
[4177.62 --> 4180.02]  I think it not working is the least of our concerns.
[4180.14 --> 4182.82]  The fact that it exists at all is a much bigger problem for me.
[4182.82 --> 4185.04]  I wish with these things we could know how many of them have sold.
[4185.04 --> 4186.02]  That would get disgusting.
[4186.42 --> 4187.66]  Because, like, think about it.
[4187.88 --> 4189.64]  Look, the thing is that...
[4189.64 --> 4193.68]  I had to have this conversation with one of the younger male members of my family
[4193.68 --> 4195.28]  a little while ago, and it kind of went,
[4195.38 --> 4200.06]  Look, the point of lifting up the seat is not whether or not you can aim through it.
[4200.36 --> 4202.58]  It's whether it's gonna take any splash damage.
[4203.18 --> 4203.54]  Okay?
[4203.54 --> 4206.84]  So it doesn't matter how perfect your aim is.
[4207.10 --> 4210.58]  You still need to move things out of the way.
[4211.56 --> 4215.04]  This is guaranteed to get absolutely disgusting.
[4215.42 --> 4216.54]  And...
[4217.32 --> 4221.38]  You have to, like, manhandle it to get new battery.
[4221.54 --> 4222.66]  Three AAAs?
[4223.20 --> 4227.74]  I'm gonna spend a fortune watching it so I can see my poop better.
[4228.16 --> 4229.50]  But this is ridiculous.
[4229.98 --> 4230.54]  It's a...
[4230.54 --> 4233.16]  Yeah, it's a defecation enhancer.
[4233.54 --> 4235.38]  That's the new name on Wish.
[4235.58 --> 4236.64]  Defecation enhancer.
[4236.92 --> 4237.88]  Alright, alright.
[4238.06 --> 4239.04]  Okay, hit us again.
[4239.30 --> 4239.64]  Alright.
[4244.26 --> 4247.86]  I have no idea if this segment is good or bad.
[4248.14 --> 4249.56]  Oh, well, this is one of those games.
[4250.04 --> 4251.62]  This is one of those games where...
[4251.62 --> 4252.14]  This is a shock game?
[4252.14 --> 4253.26]  Yeah, you get zapped.
[4253.36 --> 4253.88]  I don't...
[4253.88 --> 4256.18]  So is it like a Russian roulette shocking game?
[4256.20 --> 4257.08]  Oh, got it in one.
[4257.32 --> 4258.44]  Oh, okay.
[4259.46 --> 4261.08]  I mean, do you want to play?
[4261.18 --> 4262.50]  I don't know why it has suction cups.
[4262.50 --> 4265.74]  Uh, so that it doesn't move when people are like...
[4265.74 --> 4266.04]  You know.
[4266.54 --> 4268.00]  So you can suction it to the table.
[4268.00 --> 4269.36]  I mean, should we find out how much it hurts?
[4269.36 --> 4269.98]  I mean, we can if you want.
[4270.10 --> 4271.06]  I feel like...
[4271.06 --> 4272.04]  It's not...
[4272.04 --> 4273.76]  Want is such a strong word, Luke.
[4273.78 --> 4274.60]  It's the WAN show.
[4274.62 --> 4277.28]  We can if you think it will enhance the viewer experience.
[4277.28 --> 4280.38]  I mean, I think there's no doubt that it'll enhance the viewer experience.
[4280.38 --> 4280.68]  Okay.
[4281.12 --> 4282.02]  So are they...
[4282.02 --> 4283.30]  Are you joining us, Dan?
[4283.50 --> 4283.74]  No.
[4284.24 --> 4284.50]  Oh.
[4285.56 --> 4286.36]  Oh, jeez.
[4286.82 --> 4287.56]  I had a little...
[4287.56 --> 4288.30]  Oh, because it's covered.
[4288.30 --> 4288.86]  Okay.
[4289.30 --> 4290.02]  Um...
[4290.02 --> 4292.54]  I mean, why are we doing this?
[4292.54 --> 4292.90]  I don't know.
[4292.98 --> 4293.56]  I'm not excited.
[4293.64 --> 4295.64]  This is the world's most pointless game.
[4295.82 --> 4296.50]  Flick on the switch.
[4296.88 --> 4297.86]  I already did.
[4298.04 --> 4298.58]  Okay, start.
[4301.26 --> 4302.08]  Now press start.
[4302.26 --> 4302.66]  I did.
[4302.68 --> 4303.14]  He did.
[4303.14 --> 4303.40]  He did.
[4303.58 --> 4304.48]  It's rouletting.
[4306.38 --> 4307.64]  I don't want it to be me.
[4307.86 --> 4308.84]  Does it know we're in this?
[4308.84 --> 4309.24]  I don't even know how much...
[4309.24 --> 4309.54]  Ah!
[4310.38 --> 4311.30]  Well, I didn't lose.
[4311.36 --> 4311.90]  All right, we're done.
[4312.12 --> 4313.14]  Why did you flinch?
[4313.26 --> 4313.68]  I heard...
[4313.68 --> 4314.42]  That hurt me.
[4315.10 --> 4316.06]  I flinched.
[4319.20 --> 4321.68]  By the way, it actually didn't hurt that much.
[4321.72 --> 4322.44]  It more startled me.
[4322.62 --> 4323.02]  They're always startling.
[4323.02 --> 4323.86]  It's pretty crappy.
[4324.32 --> 4324.46]  Yeah.
[4324.48 --> 4326.16]  Well, I mean, there's ones that hurt.
[4326.24 --> 4328.12]  Remember when we did it with the dog shot collars?
[4328.50 --> 4329.06]  Those were brutal.
[4329.06 --> 4330.70]  Which, by the way, are inhumane.
[4330.92 --> 4331.30]  Those were brutal.
[4331.30 --> 4336.32]  Having personally experienced it a lot, I would say you should not use them.
[4336.40 --> 4337.26]  That's very bad.
[4337.66 --> 4340.62]  If you zapped your dog with this, though, I'd honestly be fine with it.
[4340.62 --> 4342.14]  Someone quoted me saying, I didn't lose.
[4342.18 --> 4342.70]  All right, we're done.
[4342.70 --> 4344.48]  That's how Russian Roulette works.
[4344.98 --> 4346.42]  If you lose that...
[4346.42 --> 4350.66]  If there's two people playing and one of them lose, you really don't have to continue.
[4350.66 --> 4351.18]  Yeah, you won.
[4351.36 --> 4351.54]  Yeah.
[4352.20 --> 4352.78]  All right.
[4354.18 --> 4354.86]  Oh, man.
[4354.98 --> 4356.06]  Are you good, or would you like one more?
[4356.30 --> 4357.44]  Hit us with one more.
[4357.50 --> 4358.06]  Let's do it.
[4359.60 --> 4359.96]  Jeez.
[4361.64 --> 4366.20]  You know, Jessica, when you started and I asked you to come up with WAN show segments,
[4366.20 --> 4367.54]  this isn't what I had in mind.
[4367.68 --> 4368.48]  I love it, though.
[4368.54 --> 4369.26]  This is pretty good.
[4369.28 --> 4370.24]  This is pretty amazing.
[4370.38 --> 4371.14]  What is that?
[4371.14 --> 4373.58]  When we first met, you told me to make you scared of me.
[4375.58 --> 4376.46]  Did I say that?
[4376.52 --> 4377.80]  That sounds like something I would say.
[4377.82 --> 4378.54]  Pretty much verbatim.
[4378.78 --> 4379.08]  Okay.
[4379.94 --> 4381.52]  A lot of people have wonderful first quotes.
[4381.52 --> 4383.52]  Okay, then I basically did ask you to do this.
[4384.02 --> 4384.38]  Explicitly.
[4384.74 --> 4385.06]  Okay.
[4385.84 --> 4386.92]  This is...
[4388.12 --> 4389.28]  Here, do you want to touch it first?
[4390.42 --> 4391.02]  It's hollow.
[4391.46 --> 4391.76]  Yeah.
[4391.76 --> 4393.72]  It seems to be a metal...
[4393.72 --> 4397.28]  Here, I'm going to go to the loot cam if you want to show the people what you're holding.
[4398.72 --> 4400.42]  It's sort of irregularly shaped.
[4400.54 --> 4403.14]  I think it's symmetrical, but it's like kind of...
[4403.14 --> 4409.34]  It reminds me of what like a cheap, crappy, you know, mass-produced pet rock might be.
[4409.78 --> 4411.72]  Like a digital pet rock, you know?
[4411.78 --> 4412.38]  Like it's metal.
[4412.72 --> 4413.58]  It's not...
[4413.58 --> 4414.50]  Okay, that's helpful.
[4415.82 --> 4416.88]  I was just trying to figure out...
[4416.88 --> 4418.56]  I'm sure that was great for everyone's mic.
[4418.64 --> 4421.00]  Is there some form of structure inside of it?
[4421.14 --> 4421.60]  Something like that.
[4421.72 --> 4422.92]  This is a tech product.
[4423.40 --> 4425.12]  It was listed under tech products, yes.
[4425.12 --> 4428.00]  Here, can I see it again?
[4428.22 --> 4431.26]  I mean, I'm not...
[4431.26 --> 4437.20]  This is not a real guess, but it wouldn't surprise me if someone marketed it as like an ESD, you
[4437.20 --> 4442.32]  know, ESD stone, you know, just hold this and it, you know, discharges your ESD or something
[4442.32 --> 4443.56]  like that for working on tech.
[4443.64 --> 4447.46]  Like obviously that would be false that you can watch the recent collab we did with Electro
[4447.46 --> 4453.54]  Boom where we completely debunked any ESD anything that doesn't attach to an outlet.
[4455.12 --> 4460.58]  Yeah, people have like told me in chat what they think it is, but I would have never guessed
[4460.58 --> 4461.82]  that, so I'm not going to say it.
[4462.86 --> 4465.20]  There's like no shot I would have guessed that.
[4465.96 --> 4467.86]  Someone guessed steel soap bar.
[4468.12 --> 4469.72]  I mean, you know...
[4469.72 --> 4471.58]  People said garlic soap.
[4471.86 --> 4472.78]  Garlic soap?
[4472.90 --> 4474.28]  I mean, it's not garlic soap.
[4474.28 --> 4475.14]  It doesn't smell like garlic.
[4476.04 --> 4477.46]  It smells like stainless steel.
[4477.66 --> 4482.46]  It is in fact stainless steel soap.
[4482.46 --> 4484.76]  It doesn't work.
[4486.76 --> 4491.86]  But according to Wikipedia, it does not work, but it is intended to get rid of the smell
[4491.86 --> 4492.30]  of garlic.
[4496.00 --> 4496.44]  What?
[4497.80 --> 4498.20]  What indeed?
[4498.20 --> 4498.92]  I don't know.
[4498.92 --> 4506.52]  So we're just literally taking metal and just putting it in a shape and...
[4506.52 --> 4507.52]  I mean, that's brilliant.
[4507.64 --> 4510.72]  Making claims about its magical properties.
[4510.72 --> 4518.26]  I mean, the thing is that like there are real metal properties that, you know, are kind
[4518.26 --> 4518.84]  of like that.
[4519.00 --> 4520.30]  Like silver is antimicrobial.
[4520.46 --> 4520.72]  Copper too.
[4520.72 --> 4521.92]  There's some other ones as well.
[4521.92 --> 4528.44]  You know, okay, that's why IUDs, for example, are made of copper because it creates a very
[4528.44 --> 4532.82]  hostile environment for sperm, for example.
[4533.38 --> 4538.02]  And if you just take like an old earring or an old necklace that you don't care about anymore
[4538.02 --> 4542.26]  and you drop it in your reservoir, as long as it doesn't get sucked into the pump, that
[4542.26 --> 4542.74]  would be bad.
[4542.88 --> 4544.22]  But you just drop that in your reservoir.
[4544.34 --> 4545.94]  You don't need to put any additives in it.
[4545.94 --> 4549.78]  The silver ions will destroy any microbes in your lube.
[4550.40 --> 4559.22]  So there are reality-based things kind of like this, but this one I have never heard
[4559.22 --> 4560.98]  of before and I frankly don't believe.
[4561.18 --> 4564.66]  I can guarantee it will clean your hands exactly as well as rubbing it on silverware.
[4565.84 --> 4568.16]  Just the knives in your kitchen.
[4568.16 --> 4572.68]  It might actually be worse if you get tarnished, you know, silver gunk all over you.
[4572.68 --> 4577.30]  And because actual silverware, if it's actually made out of silver, would actually have antimicrobial
[4577.30 --> 4577.54]  properties.
[4577.54 --> 4578.30]  Oh, that's true.
[4578.58 --> 4579.66]  So fake silverware.
[4579.74 --> 4580.56]  Maybe not as well.
[4580.64 --> 4581.52]  Yeah, there we go.
[4581.72 --> 4581.78]  Yeah.
[4581.78 --> 4582.08]  Okay.
[4582.28 --> 4583.78]  But it will be healthier than pewter.
[4584.84 --> 4585.00]  So.
[4585.70 --> 4591.82]  Top Gear 1224 in Floatplane Chat asks, copper, yet you had growth in whole room water cooling.
[4591.82 --> 4597.04]  Okay, so the thing with copper is that it's not nearly as effective as silver as an antimicrobial
[4597.04 --> 4598.28]  ion or whatever.
[4598.48 --> 4600.44]  And number two is that wasn't microbes.
[4600.44 --> 4605.86]  That is a very common misconception about the downfall of whole room water cooling.
[4605.96 --> 4607.58]  It was not stuff growing in the loop.
[4607.66 --> 4608.40]  That never happened.
[4608.74 --> 4615.26]  What happened was I bought a stainless steel reservoir tank from Princess Auto that was not
[4615.26 --> 4616.40]  stainless steel.
[4616.64 --> 4619.10]  So what you saw in all the blocks was rust.
[4619.32 --> 4624.68]  The reason that I said in the video it must be microbes was because there wasn't any iron
[4624.68 --> 4627.98]  in the loop that I knew of.
[4627.98 --> 4631.72]  So that's how that whole thing went down.
[4631.80 --> 4634.08]  It was just rust in everything.
[4634.86 --> 4636.52]  That's why it also couldn't be cleaned.
[4636.62 --> 4639.40]  If it had been microbe crap, then we could have scrubbed it off.
[4639.44 --> 4642.66]  But it was rust and it settled into everything and it stained it all.
[4643.74 --> 4644.64]  It was awful.
[4645.00 --> 4645.36]  Okay.
[4645.68 --> 4649.34]  To address someone saying in chat, we don't think everyone has actual silver silverware.
[4649.60 --> 4651.14]  But if you say silverware.
[4651.14 --> 4651.26]  Yeah.
[4651.26 --> 4652.62]  Who has silver silverware?
[4652.68 --> 4653.88]  I don't have silver silverware.
[4653.88 --> 4654.44]  Of course not.
[4654.58 --> 4655.02]  Who would?
[4655.34 --> 4655.62]  Yeah.
[4656.08 --> 4657.26]  Maybe if you inherited it.
[4657.32 --> 4659.02]  Does anybody even make silverware?
[4659.14 --> 4661.00]  If you say silverware, then you should.
[4661.48 --> 4661.80]  Yeah.
[4661.88 --> 4662.30]  I don't know.
[4662.38 --> 4664.72]  Can you still buy real silverware?
[4664.72 --> 4666.16]  I'm 100% certain you can.
[4666.50 --> 4667.86]  I guarantee you someone makes it.
[4668.36 --> 4669.24]  SilverSuperstore.com.
[4669.30 --> 4669.48]  Okay.
[4669.54 --> 4669.84]  Hold on.
[4669.90 --> 4670.16]  Hold on.
[4670.52 --> 4672.24]  The Sterling Silver Advantage.
[4672.92 --> 4673.50]  Oh, okay.
[4674.00 --> 4674.40]  Okay.
[4674.40 --> 4674.84]  Okay.
[4675.00 --> 4677.68]  So manufacturers like Reed and Barton.
[4677.88 --> 4678.26]  This is.
[4678.36 --> 4678.46]  Yeah.
[4678.78 --> 4679.14]  Gorham.
[4679.38 --> 4679.60]  Yeah.
[4680.24 --> 4681.42]  Wallace Silversmith.
[4682.44 --> 4682.84]  Lunt.
[4685.06 --> 4685.46]  Christoffel.
[4687.10 --> 4688.06]  Oh, here, here, here.
[4688.08 --> 4688.58]  I can show you guys.
[4688.64 --> 4689.94]  These are the actual manufacturers.
[4690.06 --> 4690.20]  Okay.
[4690.52 --> 4691.58]  Was that the last one, Jessica?
[4692.02 --> 4692.30]  Yes.
[4692.38 --> 4692.70]  All right.
[4692.76 --> 4693.50]  Thank you so much.
[4693.50 --> 4694.08]  Thank you very much.
[4694.10 --> 4695.50]  We'll see you again.
[4695.60 --> 4696.46]  That was fantastic.
[4696.70 --> 4696.84]  Woo.
[4697.78 --> 4698.68]  Your scripty thing.
[4699.26 --> 4702.10]  Oh, a very surprised amount of people said that that one works.
[4703.04 --> 4703.34]  Okay.
[4703.34 --> 4708.98]  And people were saying that at certain barbecues and stuff like that, it is not very practical
[4708.98 --> 4710.98]  to actually put covers on your food.
[4711.80 --> 4713.00]  So they use those things.
[4713.04 --> 4714.52]  And apparently it's like actually a thing.
[4714.76 --> 4715.68]  So, all right.
[4715.70 --> 4716.22]  That's cool.
[4716.54 --> 4717.68]  I've never been in that scenario.
[4717.80 --> 4719.48]  I've always been in places where you can just cover it.
[4720.48 --> 4720.88]  Whoa.
[4722.54 --> 4723.44]  Five piece.
[4723.76 --> 4725.24]  What the f***?
[4727.82 --> 4730.14]  Silver is not worth that much money.
[4731.48 --> 4732.62]  Like we talk about.
[4732.62 --> 4732.88]  Okay.
[4732.88 --> 4734.58]  Are those like handcrafted?
[4734.64 --> 4735.42]  Are those like smithed or something?
[4735.42 --> 4735.52]  Okay.
[4735.52 --> 4738.52]  We talk about silver and gold in the same sentences.
[4739.44 --> 4740.56]  Isn't that five place settings?
[4740.70 --> 4741.92]  But by comparison.
[4742.46 --> 4742.74]  No.
[4742.96 --> 4744.84]  That is a single place setting.
[4745.04 --> 4745.24]  What?
[4745.34 --> 4746.14]  Five pieces.
[4746.28 --> 4746.46]  Yeah.
[4746.56 --> 4747.38]  I need that fly thing.
[4747.52 --> 4748.52]  One soup spoon.
[4750.64 --> 4751.04]  $420.
[4751.52 --> 4751.96]  Nice.
[4752.40 --> 4752.84]  Nice.
[4752.94 --> 4753.38]  Nice.
[4753.62 --> 4753.82]  Nice.
[4753.82 --> 4755.56]  What the f***?
[4755.56 --> 4760.20]  So, I suspect there's, I suspect these are solid silver.
[4760.34 --> 4760.94]  Yeah, but still.
[4760.94 --> 4762.44]  I suspect these are like smithed.
[4762.66 --> 4764.42]  I bet you there is silver plated.
[4765.42 --> 4766.48]  Mass manufactured.
[4766.72 --> 4767.84]  That are probably cheaper.
[4769.00 --> 4770.90]  Silver's not that flippin' expensive.
[4771.06 --> 4771.34]  Hold on.
[4771.38 --> 4771.70]  Hold on.
[4771.70 --> 4774.20]  So, Conrad said earlier.
[4775.10 --> 4776.80]  Sorry, I just find this very funny.
[4777.16 --> 4779.16]  Conrad said earlier, I have silver cutlery.
[4779.28 --> 4783.78]  And then you showed that and he says, in hindsight, I no longer believe I have silver cutlery.
[4783.78 --> 4789.26]  It's probably plated, which still, like, counts.
[4789.40 --> 4793.58]  This is probably, like, I don't know brands, so I'm gonna say Tiffany.
[4794.08 --> 4802.40]  Like, you know how Tiffany jewelry costs, you know, $4,000 or whatever for a tiny little, like, diamond solitaire?
[4802.40 --> 4814.78]  That even, even if we believe the, you know, bulls*** value of diamonds that the diamond industry would have us believe is still only worth, like, you know, $150.
[4815.34 --> 4815.52]  Yeah.
[4815.62 --> 4821.42]  So, we may very well be looking at the, like, Tiffany version of what silverware costs.
[4821.48 --> 4822.38]  Because here, hold on a second.
[4822.88 --> 4823.70]  Hold on a second.
[4823.80 --> 4827.70]  So, what's, like, man, I don't know.
[4827.70 --> 4832.14]  I don't really do metals speculation.
[4833.32 --> 4833.84]  So, um.
[4834.48 --> 4837.92]  Someone in chat said $23 something cents for an ounce of silver right now.
[4837.92 --> 4838.36]  For an ounce.
[4838.44 --> 4838.66]  Okay.
[4838.94 --> 4842.08]  Okay, so how many ounces of silver in a fork?
[4843.60 --> 4847.40]  Is this something that Google search can help you with?
[4847.40 --> 4847.72]  Okay.
[4848.08 --> 4850.44]  Jay Richie said it's $23.31 an ounce.
[4850.56 --> 4850.74]  Okay.
[4851.00 --> 4856.72]  So, a large serving fork can weigh anywhere from three quarters to one and a half ounces.
[4856.72 --> 4860.64]  Yeah, but a large serving fork might, that, some of those are, like, big, big.
[4860.74 --> 4865.14]  Yeah, an average, on average, less than an ounce of silver per piece.
[4865.68 --> 4870.56]  So, no, you may very well own silver flatware at, like.
[4871.02 --> 4871.96]  Troy ounces.
[4872.34 --> 4874.54]  30 to 50 bucks a pop.
[4875.12 --> 4876.78]  Uh, how much silver is in a silver fork?
[4876.86 --> 4877.30]  Here we go.
[4877.74 --> 4881.52]  Real silver flatware is typical sterling silver or 92 and a half percent.
[4881.64 --> 4882.84]  Okay, that doesn't tell me anything.
[4882.84 --> 4890.82]  Uh, how much does a, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, 14, 14 to 44 grams.
[4890.92 --> 4898.04]  So, so, one way or another, we are, we are a solid order of magnitude off on that site.
[4898.34 --> 4899.34]  For sure.
[4899.70 --> 4900.84]  Like, 100%.
[4901.40 --> 4901.84]  Um.
[4901.84 --> 4906.10]  A troy ounce is only slightly bigger than a regular ounce.
[4906.20 --> 4907.38]  So, it's, like, fine.
[4907.50 --> 4912.34]  We can, we can somewhat, we can definitely say that these guys are out to lunch.
[4912.94 --> 4914.30]  Very expensive lunch.
[4915.02 --> 4916.02]  Uh, what, sorry, what do you got, Luke?
[4916.28 --> 4917.78]  Uh, Tiffany makes silverware.
[4918.12 --> 4918.76]  Oh, of course they do.
[4919.42 --> 4920.76]  And how much is, how much is Tiffany?
[4921.04 --> 4921.66]  Uh, well, this.
[4921.66 --> 4922.16]  Should I go on your screen?
[4922.26 --> 4923.06]  This, yeah, sure.
[4923.16 --> 4925.44]  This random fork I'm looking at is $470.
[4926.04 --> 4926.26]  Yeah.
[4926.64 --> 4927.46]  Yeah, see, there you go.
[4927.54 --> 4931.18]  So, this is just, like, stupid, like, name brand pricing.
[4931.48 --> 4935.24]  So, what if I go on, if I go on, like, eBay, I'm probably going to get something more realistic.
[4935.42 --> 4936.08]  It's a serving fork.
[4936.14 --> 4936.82]  It's 12 inches.
[4938.16 --> 4939.00]  It's a big fork.
[4939.16 --> 4940.06]  Oh, that's a big fork.
[4940.18 --> 4940.76]  It's a big fork.
[4941.02 --> 4941.38]  Okay.
[4941.66 --> 4942.02]  Okay.
[4942.40 --> 4943.46]  What if we look at these?
[4943.72 --> 4944.22]  There you go.
[4944.52 --> 4945.58]  That's just a carving knife.
[4945.58 --> 4946.58]  Do they do fish cutlery?
[4947.12 --> 4947.82]  I don't know.
[4948.24 --> 4948.90]  Here we go.
[4949.24 --> 4949.88]  Here we go.
[4949.94 --> 4950.20]  Hold on.
[4950.32 --> 4951.54]  We're, we're going, we're on my screen now.
[4951.64 --> 4953.26]  A cheese knife for 200 bucks.
[4953.26 --> 4955.88]  That's just darn, it's affordable.
[4956.16 --> 4958.24]  Here's some, here's some silver flatware.
[4958.40 --> 4960.60]  11.5 ounces for 10 bucks.
[4961.30 --> 4962.16]  Used, tarnished.
[4962.26 --> 4963.34]  Hey, this is fun.
[4963.76 --> 4967.34]  Did you know that you can untarnish silver items?
[4967.56 --> 4968.08]  How do you do that?
[4968.14 --> 4969.54]  Like, not, not polish them.
[4969.70 --> 4970.40]  Polish bad.
[4970.74 --> 4974.00]  Because when you polish, you are actually removing the material.
[4974.56 --> 4974.68]  Oh.
[4974.86 --> 4981.50]  Yeah, so you are, you are, eventually, if you polish a silver object enough times, you will polish it into oblivion.
[4981.50 --> 4983.28]  Oh, I know what I want for Christmas now.
[4983.38 --> 4987.16]  There's a, there's a silver ladle from Tiffany that's a thousand dollars.
[4987.26 --> 4987.94]  That seems reasonable.
[4987.94 --> 4988.10]  Yeah, cool.
[4988.16 --> 4990.42]  You need to put that website away before it makes you too angry.
[4990.50 --> 4992.26]  Yeah, I'm actually upset about that.
[4992.26 --> 4993.50]  You can't handle that sort of thing.
[4993.70 --> 4994.68]  Honestly, I can't either.
[4994.76 --> 4995.86]  That's why I'm on eBay instead.
[4996.26 --> 5003.56]  So what you do is you take aluminum, and you can just take any aluminum, aluminum foil, whatever, and you put it in boiling water.
[5003.72 --> 5005.30]  This is going to sound like alchemy.
[5005.70 --> 5006.08]  It's going to sound like.
[5006.08 --> 5006.82]  It already does.
[5006.82 --> 5008.64]  It's going to sound like stainless steel soap, but for real.
[5009.16 --> 5011.66]  So you take, you take a ball of aluminum, you chuck it in.
[5011.72 --> 5014.34]  I believe it's just boiling water, and then you put in baking soda.
[5014.56 --> 5022.62]  And what it does is it reverses the, the, the chemical reaction, the oxidation that causes tarnishing and restores it.
[5022.66 --> 5023.96]  I have actually, oh, is it vinegar?
[5025.12 --> 5025.38]  Okay.
[5025.46 --> 5026.24]  It might not be water.
[5026.30 --> 5026.84]  It might be vinegar.
[5026.92 --> 5027.14]  Oh, wait.
[5027.18 --> 5028.60]  No, you wouldn't put baking soda in vinegar.
[5028.72 --> 5028.82]  Okay.
[5028.82 --> 5029.30]  Hold on a second.
[5029.30 --> 5030.02]  Now I have to check.
[5030.02 --> 5030.74]  Okay.
[5030.84 --> 5036.12]  How, how do you restore silver, aluminum?
[5036.90 --> 5038.78]  I just had a physical reaction.
[5039.10 --> 5043.72]  East of Eaton said a $1,000 soup ladle is more justifiable than a $1,000 GPU.
[5043.98 --> 5047.22]  Line container with foil, add silver items, add baking soda, boil water.
[5047.32 --> 5047.46]  Yeah.
[5047.72 --> 5047.90]  Yeah.
[5047.94 --> 5048.64]  So I had it right.
[5048.68 --> 5052.86]  I did this when I was in high school because I did a, like a metalsmithing class in school.
[5052.86 --> 5057.48]  And my silver stuff got tarnished and I was like, so what?
[5057.54 --> 5058.52]  I like polish it now.
[5058.78 --> 5063.10]  And it was recommended that I not polish it because it had very fine details on it that
[5063.10 --> 5064.32]  eventually would disappear.
[5064.48 --> 5068.72]  And then I found out about this restoration method and it works amazing.
[5069.08 --> 5070.78]  It looked like, it looked like it was polished.
[5070.88 --> 5071.56]  It looked brand new.
[5071.82 --> 5073.74]  Tool restoration is actually a really cool thing.
[5073.86 --> 5076.08]  Oh, that's a whole YouTube rabbit hole on YouTube.
[5076.58 --> 5079.90]  You do have to make sure, my dad says use ketchup.
[5079.90 --> 5083.58]  Apparently he's a WAN show chat person now.
[5083.72 --> 5084.42]  Oh, okay.
[5084.54 --> 5085.34]  He said use ketchup.
[5085.46 --> 5085.70]  What's up, Rob?
[5085.84 --> 5087.86]  I've heard of that before too, but I have no idea.
[5088.20 --> 5090.60]  But yeah, tool restoration on YouTube is a fun rabbit hole to go down.
[5090.76 --> 5095.12]  I will warn you, there's a solid amount of people that fake it for views.
[5096.30 --> 5096.70]  Oh.
[5096.94 --> 5097.64]  Totally a thing.
[5097.68 --> 5098.40]  Never occurred to me.
[5098.56 --> 5098.78]  Yeah.
[5098.90 --> 5099.34]  They'll like.
[5099.40 --> 5100.02]  It makes sense though.
[5100.20 --> 5100.40]  Yeah.
[5100.44 --> 5105.06]  They'll like fake ruin something so that it's easy to restore.
[5105.78 --> 5106.86]  And then they do that.
[5106.94 --> 5107.46]  I got it.
[5107.46 --> 5109.42]  Instead of taking like actually worn down things.
[5109.42 --> 5112.10]  That's been like sitting for a hundred years or whatever.
[5112.32 --> 5112.44]  Yeah.
[5112.46 --> 5114.02]  Which is, it's lame.
[5114.42 --> 5115.18]  So, so.
[5115.34 --> 5115.76]  Got it.
[5115.86 --> 5116.26]  Pay attention.
[5116.48 --> 5116.78]  But yeah.
[5119.58 --> 5121.54]  What are we supposed to be doing right now, Dan?
[5124.74 --> 5125.10]  Okay.
[5125.16 --> 5126.78]  Why don't we just, why don't we do sponsors?
[5126.94 --> 5127.16]  All right.
[5127.20 --> 5130.16]  The show is brought to you today by Metadoc.
[5130.58 --> 5133.24]  Do you multitask while browsing the internet?
[5133.94 --> 5135.10]  Then you might be human.
[5135.10 --> 5137.86]  If you do check out Metadoc, our sponsor.
[5138.34 --> 5143.64]  They're the ultimate workspace organizer, allowing you to dock as many windows as you like in a single window.
[5144.26 --> 5152.48]  Oh, for example, you're watching WAN show right now, but you also want to shop on LTT store or Amazon, or you want to buy silver flatware on eBay.
[5152.48 --> 5153.54]  I don't know.
[5153.94 --> 5156.36]  All you got to do is drag the tab and choose a layout.
[5156.66 --> 5160.66]  Now all the windows are docked and you can do this with your favorite GIF.
[5161.36 --> 5162.16]  Oh, great.
[5162.36 --> 5162.72]  Beautiful.
[5162.98 --> 5163.84]  That's amazing.
[5165.26 --> 5169.22]  Not only that, Metadoc allows you to manage different accounts without needing to log out.
[5169.32 --> 5172.24]  So you can upload videos on different YouTube channels all at once.
[5172.32 --> 5173.38]  Okay, that's super cool.
[5174.22 --> 5176.96]  Metadoc is not only for browsers, but also for apps like Word.
[5177.06 --> 5178.98]  So you can write up notes while watching the Apple event.
[5179.44 --> 5182.02]  And their panic button can save your day with just one click.
[5182.02 --> 5186.16]  It hides all the confidential windows, so no one will know what you are doing or watching.
[5186.98 --> 5189.50]  You can also create your workspaces for different purposes.
[5189.50 --> 5195.12]  Whether your workspace contains two windows or 50 windows, Metadoc will save and restore what you had opened last time.
[5195.48 --> 5196.22]  That's super cool.
[5196.64 --> 5202.28]  The number of times that I've come to my computer and thought, okay, this window should pop up exactly where I left it, and it's just somewhere random.
[5202.38 --> 5203.02]  It's very frustrating.
[5203.12 --> 5203.78]  Yeah, it's actually pretty sweet.
[5203.78 --> 5206.86]  So if you're tired of shifting windows and want to increase your productivity, try out Metadoc.
[5206.86 --> 5213.10]  It is free until 2024 on Steam or by direct download from the Metadoc website, which we will have linked down below.

[5213.94 --> 5215.42]  The show is also brought to you by Kudos.
[5216.16 --> 5218.28]  Did you see the Alien unboxing in Mexico?
[5218.28 --> 5219.28]  Okay.
[5221.04 --> 5222.32]  Everything is possible.
[5222.62 --> 5226.24]  Like doubling your credit card awards for free with our sponsor, Kudos.

[5271.60 --> 5274.72]  Finally, the show is brought to you by Ridge Hennessy.
[5275.12 --> 5277.74]  There's something big that you shouldn't be proud of.
[5278.22 --> 5278.86]  Your wallet.
[5279.54 --> 5284.14]  It's not only bulky and uncomfortable in your pocket, but it's also visually unpleasing.
[5284.54 --> 5286.50]  Get rid of it and meet the Ridge.
[5286.70 --> 5290.08]  They redefined the traditional wallet with compact and stylish designs.
[5290.46 --> 5295.70]  Their wallets can hold up to 12 cards, plus they've got room for cash with either a money clip or an elastic band.
[5295.86 --> 5299.92]  And they have over 30 color and style variations, so there's something for every taste.
[5299.92 --> 5305.66]  The Ridge and Hennessy Performance are also teaming up again for Ridge's third annual summer sweepstakes.
[5306.06 --> 5311.94]  You can win amazing prizes like a Hennessy Ford Bronco or $75,000 cash.
[5312.38 --> 5315.52]  No purchase is necessary, but you get a bonus entry for every dollar spent,
[5315.68 --> 5320.88]  or you get up to 1,000 bonus entries for every dollar spent on their custom Hennessy products.
[5321.18 --> 5324.96]  Just head over to their website to secure yourself some sleek wallets and fancy key cases,
[5325.38 --> 5328.80]  and maybe you'll end up in a Hennessy Ford Bronco Velociraptor in the process.
[5328.80 --> 5333.10]  Check out the link down below for 10 free entries into the sweepstakes.
[5333.32 --> 5340.88]  By the way, shout out Ridge for sponsoring what I think is going to be one of the coolest videos we have ever done on the channel.
[5341.14 --> 5341.32]  Whoa.
[5341.48 --> 5342.54]  We shot it this week.
[5342.76 --> 5344.86]  I was talking before the show with Luke.
[5344.92 --> 5346.12]  I was saying I was very tired.
[5346.12 --> 5352.08]  It was an exhausting all-day shoot and very stressful.
[5352.40 --> 5356.96]  I have never before felt lightheaded to the point where I kind of went,
[5357.08 --> 5359.12]  okay, I need to get my head down because I think I might faint.
[5359.12 --> 5364.32]  But let me put it this way.
[5366.28 --> 5370.70]  On a single roll, I had 10 grand riding.
[5372.48 --> 5372.92]  Real.
[5373.06 --> 5373.70]  Non-scripted.
[5374.40 --> 5375.74]  This is real s***.
[5376.10 --> 5376.98]  On a roll?
[5376.98 --> 5382.66]  I came up with this idea, I thought, like six months ago.
[5382.78 --> 5387.28]  But it turns out it must have been over a year ago because I know that it was when I was at the dentist
[5387.28 --> 5390.10]  and I was walking over to meet my family for lunch.
[5391.24 --> 5394.60]  I walked by one of those mom and pop computer shops.
[5394.66 --> 5395.98]  You know the kind I'm talking about, right?
[5396.02 --> 5396.32]  Yeah, yeah.
[5396.34 --> 5399.02]  Where everything they have in stock is older than my children.
[5399.10 --> 5399.32]  Yeah.
[5399.32 --> 5406.22]  And I popped my head in and I went, you know what would be the coolest video ever?
[5407.06 --> 5411.28]  Is if we go and we do an archaeological expedition into this shop
[5411.28 --> 5417.34]  and find out the stories behind all of these $60 parallel cables.
[5417.62 --> 5419.08]  You know what I'm talking about, right?
[5419.12 --> 5423.02]  Stuff that clearly hasn't had the price updated since it was put on the shelf.
[5423.20 --> 5424.66]  The box is caked in dust.
[5424.70 --> 5426.72]  The packaging is past yellow to brown.
[5426.92 --> 5428.16]  You know what I'm talking about, right?
[5428.16 --> 5430.46]  And I thought, well, okay, yeah.
[5430.58 --> 5435.36]  But, you know, we don't want to just go in and like, you know, trash on a small business.
[5435.48 --> 5437.62]  What's the way that we could make this a feel good story?
[5437.70 --> 5441.90]  What's the way that we could make this a win-win for everybody involved?
[5442.06 --> 5447.02]  And I came up with the idea of buying it all.
[5448.30 --> 5453.92]  Why don't we take all their crappy dead stock and give them a completely fresh start?
[5454.66 --> 5455.36]  We go in.
[5455.44 --> 5457.36]  It feels like a beast move.
[5457.36 --> 5458.16]  We go in.
[5458.32 --> 5462.06]  We buy every crappy DVI cable.
[5463.06 --> 5465.26]  Every ancient compact flash card.
[5465.38 --> 5467.08]  Every expired printer cartridge.
[5467.82 --> 5469.00]  We buy it all.
[5469.74 --> 5471.08]  But you know me, right?
[5472.58 --> 5473.46]  I don't like...
[5473.46 --> 5474.46]  I like to get a deal.
[5475.44 --> 5478.00]  So, I rolled in with my Ridge wallet.
[5478.20 --> 5479.20]  That's why I brought this up.
[5479.36 --> 5480.44]  The Ridge sponsored this.
[5480.44 --> 5482.38]  So, I rolled in with my Ridge wallet.
[5482.72 --> 5482.94]  Sure.
[5483.50 --> 5487.42]  But I also rolled in with a bag of Games of Chance.
[5487.92 --> 5489.04]  Oh, my God.
[5489.04 --> 5492.00]  So, the entire video.
[5492.00 --> 5495.18]  I basically had him just quote me a price on everything.
[5495.90 --> 5500.84]  And then we played games to find out, okay.
[5500.84 --> 5503.10]  Roll the die.
[5503.38 --> 5507.10]  Is it going to be 10% more than what we negotiated?
[5507.34 --> 5508.32]  10% less?
[5509.42 --> 5513.10]  Is it going to be the custom side that he created on the die?
[5513.60 --> 5516.92]  Is it going to be my custom side on the die that I created?
[5517.74 --> 5519.12]  We threw darts.
[5519.26 --> 5520.12]  We played marbles.
[5520.34 --> 5521.20]  We rolled dice.
[5521.30 --> 5522.58]  How many shops did you do this with?
[5522.62 --> 5523.18]  Just one shop.
[5523.30 --> 5523.58]  Okay.
[5523.82 --> 5525.68]  We played a game I invented called...
[5525.68 --> 5526.98]  Oh, but these are all modifiers?
[5527.10 --> 5528.18]  Called Stop the Rope.
[5528.18 --> 5532.18]  So, I put five lines on a piece of Ethernet cable.
[5532.58 --> 5533.56]  He's blindfolded.
[5533.66 --> 5534.98]  And he's got his hands like this.
[5535.08 --> 5536.22]  And the cable's running through.
[5536.50 --> 5541.28]  And I basically said, for every line, I will pay 5% more than what you quoted.
[5541.74 --> 5544.22]  But if it makes it all the way through, I get 20% off.
[5545.82 --> 5550.94]  And he just had to kind of go on instinct and try to stop it, right?
[5551.52 --> 5554.28]  So, it's a really fun video.
[5555.78 --> 5556.06]  It's...
[5556.06 --> 5556.40]  Wow.
[5556.40 --> 5562.62]  I'm not going to spoil it, but there were some moments where I was real concerned about
[5562.62 --> 5563.60]  how things were going.
[5564.80 --> 5567.00]  Sayre says darts isn't a game of chance.
[5567.68 --> 5569.68]  I think if you never play...
[5569.68 --> 5570.48]  If you play with me, it is.
[5570.54 --> 5571.58]  It basically is.
[5571.88 --> 5572.28]  Yeah.
[5572.78 --> 5575.12]  When you watch, you'll understand.
[5575.36 --> 5577.54]  The darts we were using were from the dollar store.
[5578.94 --> 5579.38]  Yeah.
[5579.68 --> 5583.54]  And that dollar included the board and four darts.
[5583.76 --> 5585.20]  Actually, it might have been like five bucks or something.
[5585.20 --> 5586.98]  But trust me, it was not...
[5586.98 --> 5589.48]  Just because you play darts doesn't mean you could throw those.
[5589.94 --> 5592.06]  This is only vaguely on topic.
[5592.18 --> 5598.48]  But in Taiwan, I was walking around with UFD Tech and Jeff from our sales team and some
[5598.48 --> 5600.42]  of the UFD Tech people and whatnot.
[5600.86 --> 5604.44]  And we came across a dart store.
[5605.08 --> 5606.84]  A darts store, I guess I should say.
[5606.84 --> 5610.52]  And the bottom of it was just like a darts shop.
[5611.02 --> 5617.48]  And it random happened to be that one of the UFD Tech guys was actually into darts.
[5618.26 --> 5619.22]  So they were like...
[5619.22 --> 5619.62]  Sure.
[5619.62 --> 5621.94]  They bought some or something, which was like cool.
[5622.00 --> 5625.10]  I was just stunned that there was a darts store at all.
[5625.24 --> 5625.46]  Yeah.
[5625.46 --> 5628.16]  And then they were like, okay, do you want to go throw them now?
[5628.42 --> 5630.26]  And we were like, what?
[5630.88 --> 5632.68]  And there was stairs that went upstairs.
[5632.96 --> 5634.64]  So we went up into the upstairs area.
[5634.74 --> 5641.98]  And the entire upstairs was just a whole row of machines that were dart throwing, internet
[5641.98 --> 5644.80]  connected, global tournament machines.
[5645.04 --> 5650.18]  So you can play locally or you can play online against other people that are playing at the
[5650.18 --> 5650.46]  machines.
[5650.46 --> 5652.72]  There's a whole bunch of different modes.
[5653.22 --> 5657.76]  And if this was around here, the bottom of the store would maybe have one customer in
[5657.76 --> 5658.80]  it and upstairs would be empty.
[5659.70 --> 5661.98]  No, this is in Taipei.
[5662.24 --> 5665.76]  The bottom of the store had like six different people shopping all at the same time.
[5665.82 --> 5667.96]  And the upstairs was full.
[5668.28 --> 5670.20]  There was no extra lanes.
[5670.48 --> 5671.74]  Every single one of them was full.
[5672.20 --> 5675.20]  And it was actually like just a really wild time.
[5675.28 --> 5676.98]  And they were good.
[5677.48 --> 5680.38]  Yeah, it was pretty wild.
[5680.70 --> 5681.50]  But anyways.
[5683.70 --> 5688.40]  Atomic Age Ace asks, you better have float plane exclusive for this video.
[5688.48 --> 5690.22]  I'll be surprised if there isn't more than one.
[5691.10 --> 5692.36]  We shot all day.
[5692.84 --> 5693.04]  Yeah.
[5693.12 --> 5699.02]  And it's going to have to be edited down into like, at most a 25 minute video, right?
[5699.08 --> 5701.46]  Like we're going to leave so much on the cutting room floor.
[5701.50 --> 5705.54]  And the guy was such a character, which you'd have to be.
[5705.96 --> 5707.70]  He's been running it over 20 years, I think.
[5707.90 --> 5708.14]  Wow.
[5708.14 --> 5708.54]  Yeah.
[5708.54 --> 5708.62]  Yeah.
[5708.78 --> 5710.66]  Like they've been around, man.
[5710.72 --> 5711.10]  They've been around.
[5711.26 --> 5711.80]  Think about it.
[5711.84 --> 5715.88]  Think about what the PC industry was like 20 years ago compared to today.
[5716.00 --> 5717.50]  How much has changed in that time?
[5717.58 --> 5718.16]  There's been feasts.
[5718.28 --> 5718.96]  There's been famine.
[5719.38 --> 5720.32]  Guy's been through everything.
[5720.32 --> 5725.46]  And it ended up being a really feel good video.
[5725.62 --> 5727.66]  I had a really great time working on it.
[5728.18 --> 5728.60]  That's cool.
[5728.72 --> 5728.84]  Yeah.
[5729.06 --> 5731.90]  Massive shout out to Ridge for sponsoring it.
[5732.26 --> 5737.92]  I feel like this is going to be, if we were to make, I don't know if you can make a series
[5737.92 --> 5738.88]  out of something like that.
[5738.94 --> 5739.38]  Maybe not.
[5739.38 --> 5742.00]  Maybe one time is enough.
[5744.46 --> 5748.68]  Speaking of series, have we talked on Wensho about a series that we're potentially going
[5748.68 --> 5749.24]  to bring back?
[5749.68 --> 5749.94]  Oh.
[5749.94 --> 5754.80]  I think it was very lightly mentioned, but very non-committally.
[5755.08 --> 5757.22]  I don't know if you want to push that forward even more.
[5762.50 --> 5763.34]  He's deciding.
[5764.14 --> 5767.22]  He's deciding live, which is maybe not the way how to do it.
[5767.22 --> 5771.14]  But I think me saying that makes him want to do it more.
[5771.36 --> 5772.28]  All right.
[5772.48 --> 5773.38]  Dramatic tension.
[5773.64 --> 5773.90]  Oops.
[5774.54 --> 5774.98]  Luke.
[5775.24 --> 5775.64]  Sorry.
[5775.92 --> 5776.94]  Luke, you're part of the problem.
[5777.52 --> 5778.10]  All right.
[5778.12 --> 5778.86]  We're going to do it.
[5779.46 --> 5784.80]  Scrapyard Wars 9 is officially being shopped for sponsorship right now.
[5784.80 --> 5788.84]  Once we've got that locked in, we're going to move forward.
[5789.50 --> 5796.98]  It's going to be, I won't tell you guys too much because there's, there's a,
[5796.98 --> 5800.80]  there's a gimmick that I'm actually personally really proud of.
[5801.52 --> 5802.86]  I think it was my idea.
[5803.40 --> 5804.54]  Maybe it wasn't.
[5804.54 --> 5805.80]  I raised the concern.
[5805.92 --> 5807.50]  In which case I'm proud of my team.
[5807.62 --> 5808.68]  I think you raised the idea.
[5808.88 --> 5809.18]  Okay.
[5809.72 --> 5815.14]  I'm really, I'm really proud of either me or my team for coming up with this idea
[5815.14 --> 5821.98]  because the gimmick I think is going to rejuvenate is the, I think the right word.
[5822.10 --> 5822.70]  You think so?
[5822.80 --> 5824.16]  I think it'll rejuvenate it.
[5824.16 --> 5824.60]  Hmm.
[5825.12 --> 5829.18]  I think it's going to be back to basics in a way that you guys are going to be really
[5829.18 --> 5834.72]  happy about, but also something new in a way that I think is going to be really fun.
[5835.90 --> 5836.72]  That's what I'll say.
[5836.74 --> 5838.18]  I don't want to spoil the gimmick, but.
[5838.24 --> 5838.36]  Yeah.
[5838.40 --> 5839.54]  We can't spoil the gimmick.
[5839.60 --> 5839.78]  Yeah.
[5839.90 --> 5841.28]  I think, I think we got it.
[5841.34 --> 5842.44]  I won't talk about it.
[5842.50 --> 5847.58]  I want them tuning into the first part, having no idea what the gimmick is because it's going
[5847.58 --> 5852.78]  to be one of those, they did not, no way moments.
[5852.78 --> 5854.48]  And I'm, I'm, I'm really excited for it.
[5854.50 --> 5856.12]  But yeah, Scrapyard Wars is coming back.
[5856.44 --> 5859.08]  I think the timing genuinely makes sense.
[5859.12 --> 5859.78]  I think so too.
[5859.86 --> 5864.12]  Because with a big part of the reason why we stopped it, one, we did too many too close
[5864.12 --> 5864.64]  to each other.
[5864.64 --> 5867.16]  And the gimmicks were getting kind of not great.
[5867.22 --> 5868.52]  It was getting kind of contrived.
[5868.52 --> 5876.82]  And especially it didn't help that everyone's got to have, you got to have the right mindset.
[5877.18 --> 5882.72]  And I feel like we, uh, we tried to create rule sets that didn't reward the right mindset
[5882.72 --> 5884.62]  to make a good Scrapyard Wars.
[5884.62 --> 5888.72]  I think there was a couple as well where not just the rule set leaned into that, but the,
[5888.72 --> 5891.04]  the budget was like just way too high.
[5891.38 --> 5891.82]  Yeah.
[5891.92 --> 5894.76]  Like what made Scrapyard Wars good was needing to be scrappy.
[5894.90 --> 5896.92]  And there was a few budgets where it was just like.
[5897.38 --> 5897.64]  Okay.
[5897.64 --> 5898.82]  We're just building computers then.
[5898.82 --> 5899.06]  Yeah.
[5899.22 --> 5899.76]  Yeah, exactly.
[5899.94 --> 5901.86]  So you need to kind of like fight for it.
[5902.12 --> 5907.56]  Um, but the, then immediately after that, the used market just got horrible.
[5907.70 --> 5907.88]  Yeah.
[5908.06 --> 5909.50]  It was completely destroyed.
[5909.62 --> 5910.76]  There was, there was nothing.
[5911.00 --> 5911.88]  Scrapyard, nothing.
[5912.22 --> 5912.42]  Yeah.
[5913.02 --> 5914.06]  There was like no point.
[5914.18 --> 5914.82]  Empty Wars.
[5914.98 --> 5915.44]  Not like.
[5915.62 --> 5915.84]  Yeah.
[5916.12 --> 5920.22]  Not only was there basically nothing available, but the prices on it was like, sometimes it
[5920.22 --> 5921.46]  was more expensive to buy used stuff.
[5921.46 --> 5924.90]  Anything capable of an internet connection was suddenly worth a thousand dollars.
[5925.02 --> 5927.14]  I'm looking at this going, well, this is ridiculous.
[5927.14 --> 5928.32]  This doesn't make any sense.
[5928.64 --> 5928.84]  Yeah.
[5929.46 --> 5935.62]  Um, so now, I mean, it's not a hundred percent fixed because, oh boy, AI GPUs and stuff like
[5935.62 --> 5935.88]  that.
[5935.88 --> 5938.56]  Um, but it's way better of a landscape now.
[5938.66 --> 5939.02]  Oh yeah.
[5939.40 --> 5939.68]  A hundred percent.
[5939.88 --> 5940.48]  A hundred percent.
[5940.64 --> 5940.86]  Yeah.
[5940.94 --> 5941.02]  Yeah.
[5941.02 --> 5941.72]  I'm excited.
[5942.98 --> 5946.98]  The, the gimmick is Linus and Luke have to grow their beards to wizard length.
[5947.20 --> 5948.04]  I tried.
[5948.16 --> 5948.62]  No, that's definitely not it.
[5948.62 --> 5950.30]  The middle ground is rough.
[5950.78 --> 5950.94]  Yeah.
[5950.94 --> 5953.16]  You need like years for that to be cool.
[5953.32 --> 5953.54]  Yeah.
[5953.54 --> 5954.94]  No, I, there's no way.
[5955.12 --> 5955.36]  Yeah.
[5957.66 --> 5958.02]  What?
[5958.16 --> 5958.72]  No, nothing.
[5958.80 --> 5962.48]  I was just, I was just, I was just wondering if you're at the middle ground right now or
[5962.48 --> 5964.06]  if you're aware that you're at the middle ground.
[5964.06 --> 5964.28]  No.
[5964.28 --> 5964.44]  Yeah.
[5964.44 --> 5965.08]  No, I know.
[5965.14 --> 5965.58]  I need to.
[5965.68 --> 5965.92]  Okay.
[5965.96 --> 5966.10]  Yeah.
[5966.10 --> 5966.46]  Me too.
[5966.54 --> 5967.58]  I'm a little overdue.
[5967.72 --> 5967.88]  Yeah.
[5967.88 --> 5970.18]  Oh, well.
[5970.40 --> 5970.86]  All right.
[5972.54 --> 5973.60]  Uh, three merch messages.
[5973.76 --> 5973.94]  Yeah.
[5973.98 --> 5974.22]  Right.
[5974.28 --> 5974.48]  Right.
[5974.54 --> 5974.96]  Hit us, Dan.
[5975.38 --> 5975.74]  Oh yeah.
[5975.80 --> 5976.00]  Sure.
[5976.24 --> 5978.02]  Uh, let's see here.
[5978.80 --> 5979.64]  Uh, hey DLL.
[5979.90 --> 5981.40]  Uh, we've already read that one.
[5981.44 --> 5981.64]  Goodbye.
[5982.14 --> 5983.06]  Hey Linus.
[5983.06 --> 5987.74]  Now the pandemic is over in quotations is what officials say, I guess.
[5987.84 --> 5989.90]  Are you planning on shaving your beard?
[5990.54 --> 5992.08]  Maybe for a fundraiser video.
[5992.08 --> 5999.50]  Um, I actually did think about shaving it earlier this week, but not for, not for any
[5999.50 --> 6002.34]  particular reason that will be apparent for a while.
[6002.74 --> 6007.92]  Um, it, people might figure it out at some point, but I'm not going to say anything more
[6007.92 --> 6011.84]  about it for now, but it basically just comes down to what my wife says.
[6011.84 --> 6014.02]  If she says, get rid of it, then it's gone.
[6014.20 --> 6017.20]  And if she says, keep it, then it, then I keep it.
[6017.22 --> 6021.44]  And she says, she still likes the look of it better than, better than a bare face.
[6021.44 --> 6026.16]  So I am keeping the, the, the furry face instead of the bare face.
[6027.90 --> 6028.34]  Yeah.
[6028.40 --> 6029.20]  Same reason.
[6030.66 --> 6036.52]  We're, you know, well, I also just like, it's easier for me anyways.
[6036.52 --> 6042.64]  So if she prefers it, which is the only person I care about, if they like what I look like.
[6042.82 --> 6044.44]  Uh, so she prefers it anyways.
[6044.44 --> 6046.68]  And it's like, okay, well, this is kind of a win-win.
[6046.92 --> 6047.10]  Yeah.
[6047.58 --> 6047.84]  Yeah.
[6048.04 --> 6048.26]  Yeah.
[6048.26 --> 6050.82]  Um, yeah.
[6051.10 --> 6051.54]  Moving on.
[6051.64 --> 6052.00]  Next one.
[6052.16 --> 6053.52]  Hey, DLL and Bread.
[6053.82 --> 6059.82]  What would your reaction be if Apple spent 5% of its cash stockpile to buy Valve, announced
[6059.82 --> 6065.94]  built-in Rosetta-like emulation for Steam games on Mac, and announced an Apple iDeck?
[6066.60 --> 6067.08]  Disbelief.
[6067.08 --> 6073.98]  Because I actually think that Valve is probably worth a lot more than 5% of Apple's cash reserves.
[6074.30 --> 6075.28]  See, that's the thing.
[6075.84 --> 6077.14]  Valve is a private company.
[6077.90 --> 6084.06]  We have no idea, except that we know that Valve is a literal money printing machine.
[6084.22 --> 6084.64]  Oh, yeah.
[6085.76 --> 6086.32]  Oh, yeah.
[6086.70 --> 6090.16]  Valve is, okay, what is, what is Apple's cash reserves right now?
[6090.20 --> 6090.78]  Hold on one second.
[6091.42 --> 6093.00]  Apple cash reserves.
[6093.00 --> 6095.72]  Don't forget that Valve takes 30% of sales.
[6096.02 --> 6096.34]  We know.
[6096.46 --> 6097.02]  Yeah, we know.
[6097.44 --> 6097.90]  We know.
[6098.46 --> 6102.46]  Apple's cash in hand was $62.48 billion.
[6102.98 --> 6107.26]  Did you just suggest that Valve could be purchased for around $750 million?
[6108.26 --> 6112.46]  Yeah, you better add an order of magnitude or two.
[6112.94 --> 6115.58]  Valve is, we have no idea.
[6115.68 --> 6116.44]  That's the thing.
[6116.44 --> 6125.94]  But on top of Valve making copious, copious amounts of money, their future outlook is outstanding.
[6126.32 --> 6129.24]  If I had an opportunity to invest in Valve, I would.
[6129.80 --> 6132.64]  Like, all conflicts of interest aside.
[6133.06 --> 6134.66]  This is not investment advice, blah, blah.
[6134.74 --> 6136.12]  I'm not a financial advisor, etc.
[6136.12 --> 6140.18]  But if I had the opportunity, I would freaking go for it.
[6140.24 --> 6146.76]  They have shown time and time again that their moats are un-impassable.
[6148.22 --> 6150.06]  Epic Games couldn't do it.
[6150.14 --> 6158.94]  Microsoft can't even put a dent in Valve's near monopolistic position in PC game sales.
[6158.94 --> 6164.82]  And now that Valve is building their own hardware platform around it, holy shit.
[6167.32 --> 6167.80]  Yeah.
[6168.44 --> 6170.90]  People are saying Valve is estimated at $8 billion.
[6171.12 --> 6172.68]  But based on what?
[6172.80 --> 6173.34]  There's no way.
[6173.58 --> 6174.30]  We don't know.
[6174.50 --> 6175.10]  There's no way.
[6175.26 --> 6179.82]  I guarantee you if they went open suddenly, their valuation would be way higher than that.
[6180.54 --> 6182.08]  There's actually no way.
[6182.08 --> 6185.26]  And valuation is not as simple as money in, money out.
[6185.38 --> 6186.24]  But that's the other thing.
[6186.24 --> 6192.28]  As far as I can tell, their overhead compared to a company like Apple is nothing.
[6192.76 --> 6193.16]  Miniscule.
[6194.00 --> 6194.44]  Nothing.
[6194.74 --> 6194.94]  Yeah.
[6196.10 --> 6197.60]  Like, how many people work there?
[6197.64 --> 6198.96]  Isn't it like a few hundred people?
[6199.82 --> 6200.94]  I don't think we even know.
[6201.08 --> 6201.76]  I found an estimate.
[6201.92 --> 6203.02]  I don't think we do know.
[6203.10 --> 6207.24]  I found an estimation website that thinks there's...
[6208.40 --> 6213.44]  Valve believes only 10,000 people around the world are capable of working for the company.
[6216.24 --> 6217.76]  I don't know what the hell that means.
[6217.94 --> 6222.14]  I found an estimation site that said they think it's 350, but I don't think that's based on anything.
[6222.26 --> 6224.30]  I found another one that claims 1100.
[6224.40 --> 6224.96]  I mean, you might...
[6224.96 --> 6226.68]  This is like celebrity net worth articles.
[6226.74 --> 6227.00]  Yes.
[6227.16 --> 6231.26]  We might as well just play darts again and just throw darts at a thing with numbers on it.
[6231.30 --> 6232.42]  We might as well make that our estimate.
[6232.54 --> 6234.90]  We don't know unless we work there.
[6234.94 --> 6236.92]  And even people who work there, I don't even know if they would know.
[6236.92 --> 6243.44]  Because they obviously do some remote work, given that Gabe Newell lives in New Zealand now or whatever.
[6244.00 --> 6249.60]  So there can't be more than three people at Valve because they can't count higher than that.
[6249.66 --> 6250.00]  No, no, no.
[6250.04 --> 6250.56]  That's not right.
[6250.94 --> 6254.70]  Because they can't count higher than that, we don't know how many people work at Valve.
[6254.78 --> 6255.62]  And neither do they.
[6255.62 --> 6263.36]  And yeah, that wouldn't account for any of the contractors that might work with Valve on projects.
[6263.68 --> 6263.76]  Yeah.
[6264.30 --> 6265.30]  No, I...
[6265.30 --> 6267.40]  Nobody knows.
[6267.52 --> 6270.42]  I don't think anyone's buying Valve anytime soon.
[6270.98 --> 6275.56]  I mean, look at the valuation of a company like Epic who can't even figure out how to compete with Valve.
[6276.38 --> 6277.90]  Like, what's Epic Games worth?
[6278.10 --> 6279.22]  Yeah, they make other stuff though.
[6280.22 --> 6280.86]  Sure, yeah.
[6280.86 --> 6281.94]  They've got the engine business.
[6281.94 --> 6285.64]  But if Valve felt like having an engine business, I'm sure they could bother with it at some point.
[6285.72 --> 6286.98]  They sort of do, right?
[6287.86 --> 6288.26]  Valve?
[6288.46 --> 6289.08]  Can't you use...
[6289.08 --> 6289.42]  Barely.
[6290.42 --> 6291.46]  Who uses Source?
[6292.94 --> 6294.02]  Titanfall 2 was in Source.
[6294.52 --> 6294.92]  Okay.
[6295.08 --> 6296.94]  So one game from like eight years ago.
[6297.00 --> 6297.94]  I don't look into...
[6298.56 --> 6300.92]  Is Gold Source even out yet?
[6302.42 --> 6304.46]  Half-life Alex was Gold Source, right?
[6304.46 --> 6306.38]  Epic Games is valued at $32 billion.
[6306.54 --> 6307.40]  I guarantee you.
[6307.40 --> 6316.34]  I give you my personal Linus Tech Tips guarantee that Valve is worth more than Epic Games by at least some multiplication factor.
[6316.58 --> 6316.94]  So, okay.
[6317.08 --> 6318.74]  So Apex Legends is in Source.
[6319.86 --> 6323.06]  But it's really not a good argument.
[6323.72 --> 6325.76]  There's very few other games.
[6326.56 --> 6329.90]  It's like Titanfall and Apex and then Valve Games.
[6330.76 --> 6332.04]  It's not very many.
[6332.50 --> 6332.94]  Ani Heikic...
[6332.94 --> 6334.92]  There are other ones, but it's not very many.
[6334.92 --> 6336.88]  Ani Heikic in Floatplane Chat says,
[6337.00 --> 6338.84]  Valve mostly just want Source for themselves.
[6339.28 --> 6341.80]  The documentation is allegedly horrendous.
[6342.70 --> 6344.24]  Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.
[6344.32 --> 6345.58]  Just Valve doing Valve things.
[6345.60 --> 6346.56]  You can work on whatever you want.
[6346.62 --> 6348.10]  No one ever wants to work on documentation.
[6348.38 --> 6349.20]  That's how it goes.
[6350.60 --> 6352.26]  Jamin1916 says,
[6352.64 --> 6357.20]  Valve was valued at $7.7 billion in May 2022 based on Bloomberg calculations.
[6357.82 --> 6359.00]  But let me tell you a thing.
[6359.40 --> 6359.98]  I actually...
[6359.98 --> 6361.98]  I don't remember if it was Bloomberg or someone else.
[6362.04 --> 6363.24]  Maybe it was like Forbes or something.
[6363.24 --> 6366.74]  These reputable sounding publications.
[6367.36 --> 6374.66]  I remember seeing a YouTuber net worth ranking thing or YouTuber earnings ranking thing that
[6374.66 --> 6375.34]  I was going through.
[6375.42 --> 6377.00]  And I was like, I know some of these people.
[6377.70 --> 6378.24]  This is...
[6378.24 --> 6379.44]  Very wrong.
[6379.52 --> 6380.58]  Not even close.
[6380.66 --> 6383.12]  You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
[6383.60 --> 6384.72]  And so I reached out.
[6384.80 --> 6386.50]  I DM'd the author of the article.
[6386.50 --> 6392.88]  I was like, hey, as someone who knows a thing or two about this industry, I would be curious
[6392.88 --> 6395.54]  to understand your methodology for calculating these.
[6396.02 --> 6398.16]  They just straight up didn't reply to me.
[6398.32 --> 6398.72]  Of course not.
[6398.74 --> 6400.82]  Because they don't have a satisfactory reply.
[6401.76 --> 6402.96]  I threw a dart at a wall.
[6403.62 --> 6404.64]  Yeah, pretty much.
[6404.84 --> 6409.78]  So that $7.7 billion, they might as well have actually pulled it out of the thing that
[6409.78 --> 6410.78]  they use to...
[6410.78 --> 6411.54]  Yeah.
[6411.54 --> 6412.20]  This to light up.
[6412.36 --> 6413.02]  Like it's...
[6413.02 --> 6413.16]  Yeah.
[6413.16 --> 6413.32]  No.
[6413.94 --> 6414.50]  Forget it.
[6415.86 --> 6418.16]  Pretzel Parkour and Flowplane Chat, I couldn't agree more.
[6418.24 --> 6419.66]  They say, let's put this talk to rest.
[6419.76 --> 6420.92]  Valve is worth at least $2.
[6421.38 --> 6421.58]  Yeah.
[6422.08 --> 6422.28]  Yeah.
[6422.44 --> 6423.02]  That and...
[6423.02 --> 6424.54]  I mean, here's another thing, guys.
[6424.60 --> 6426.94]  Something is worth whatever someone will pay.
[6427.30 --> 6429.56]  So we can argue all day about what it's worth.
[6429.62 --> 6432.34]  People are going to pay big money for Valve stock if it went public.
[6432.34 --> 6438.20]  Twitter, according to the last known purchase price for it, is worth $44 billion.
[6440.24 --> 6441.80]  That's a clever way of wording that.
[6442.32 --> 6443.28]  But that's the thing, right?
[6443.28 --> 6447.80]  So people can talk all day about what their sealed Super Mario Bros, you know, is worth
[6447.80 --> 6448.56]  or whatever, right?
[6448.98 --> 6453.02]  But it is only worth whatever the next person will pay for it.
[6453.30 --> 6459.08]  We can infer based on previous sales, but we actually don't know the worth of anything
[6459.08 --> 6462.16]  until somebody actually forks over money for it.
[6462.34 --> 6467.40]  So we could make educated guesses if we had access to their financials or whatever else.
[6467.50 --> 6468.96]  But even then, we wouldn't know.
[6469.08 --> 6472.52]  Because like I said, I think Valve's outlook is extremely positive.
[6472.60 --> 6474.04]  I think they're nowhere near done growing.
[6474.46 --> 6476.40]  I don't think gaming is anywhere near done growing.
[6476.78 --> 6482.56]  I don't think Valve's capability or potential for broadening their business is anywhere near
[6482.56 --> 6483.10]  done growing.
[6483.10 --> 6489.58]  And if you were like a Disney-style corp, imagine the money-printing machine releasing Half-Life
[6489.58 --> 6490.24]  3 would be.
[6490.82 --> 6491.10]  Oh, yeah.
[6491.74 --> 6491.92]  Yep.
[6491.92 --> 6493.02]  Like the potential reality.
[6493.02 --> 6494.90]  Or Half-Life the Cinematic Universe.
[6496.10 --> 6496.54]  Yeah.
[6496.74 --> 6497.96]  Team Fortress the movie.
[6498.28 --> 6498.56]  Yeah.
[6498.78 --> 6499.38]  Team Fortress?
[6499.46 --> 6500.30]  I'd go to that.
[6500.48 --> 6500.98]  I would too.
[6501.04 --> 6501.74]  It'd be awesome.
[6501.98 --> 6502.14]  Yeah.
[6502.22 --> 6503.98]  It'd be like Barbie movie, but Team Fortress.
[6505.34 --> 6506.92]  I used to watch like...
[6507.48 --> 6507.62]  Yeah.
[6507.74 --> 6508.04]  I don't know.
[6508.14 --> 6510.74]  I mean, Portal has so much potential.
[6510.96 --> 6511.74]  Another Portal game.
[6512.66 --> 6515.02]  Any game they've made except for Artifact.
[6515.02 --> 6516.92]  Any IP they own, basically.
[6516.98 --> 6517.64]  Except for Artifact.
[6519.24 --> 6520.56]  If you were to take...
[6520.56 --> 6523.16]  If you were to take like a...
[6523.16 --> 6523.70]  Oh, man.
[6524.42 --> 6529.94]  Valve doesn't even participate in like the mobile whale harpooning space.
[6530.40 --> 6532.40]  Like if you were to take Valve IPs...
[6532.40 --> 6532.88]  Do they?
[6532.88 --> 6538.10]  It's not mobile, but I'd say like CSGO boxes and...
[6538.10 --> 6539.88]  Sure, but it's a completely different market.
[6540.50 --> 6541.34]  So, you're right.
[6541.54 --> 6542.12]  You could...
[6542.12 --> 6544.02]  Yeah, you could get more from going from mobile for sure.
[6544.28 --> 6544.98]  I'm just...
[6544.98 --> 6545.58]  I'm just saying...
[6545.58 --> 6546.54]  Because I knew people...
[6546.54 --> 6547.14]  You're right.
[6547.32 --> 6547.54]  100%.
[6547.54 --> 6548.20]  Why not both?
[6548.58 --> 6549.18]  But...
[6549.18 --> 6549.78]  And I agree.
[6550.04 --> 6551.86]  But some people are going to be like...
[6551.86 --> 6553.84]  So, I was just making sure the clarification was made.
[6553.84 --> 6555.86]  Like if they did some mobile...
[6556.66 --> 6558.06]  Like, you know...
[6558.06 --> 6559.02]  What's that?
[6559.12 --> 6559.62]  A tiny...
[6559.62 --> 6564.40]  If they did like a tiny tower, but you build an aperture, you know, test facility, and they
[6564.40 --> 6569.48]  included all the typical, you know, valve trimmings, people play the crap out of that.
[6569.88 --> 6570.08]  Yeah.
[6570.48 --> 6570.88]  Absolutely.
[6570.98 --> 6571.58]  That sounds sick.
[6572.04 --> 6573.28]  I would play that.
[6573.68 --> 6574.08]  Right?
[6574.26 --> 6574.46]  Yeah.
[6574.78 --> 6577.10]  People would spend copious amounts of money on it.
[6577.62 --> 6577.92]  Oh, yeah.
[6577.92 --> 6578.00]  Yeah.
[6578.62 --> 6579.34]  So...
[6579.34 --> 6579.60]  Yeah.
[6579.66 --> 6582.16]  So, that 12 billion, whatever it was, is just wrong.
[6582.30 --> 6583.06]  I guarantee it.
[6583.10 --> 6584.60]  It's completely wrong.
[6584.60 --> 6585.22]  If Valve was...
[6585.22 --> 6590.64]  If Valve was valuated at 12 billion, I'd just invest everything I have immediately.
[6590.88 --> 6591.04]  Yeah.
[6591.14 --> 6592.80]  Again, not advice, blah, blah, blah.
[6592.96 --> 6597.80]  But like, holy crap, because you know that's hockey sticking the second people realize how
[6597.80 --> 6599.08]  incredibly undervalued it is.
[6599.58 --> 6600.28]  Like, I don't know.
[6600.28 --> 6604.56]  One interesting thing, just because we're talking about Steam, this has been something
[6604.56 --> 6606.62]  that I've been paying a lot of attention to, actually.
[6606.62 --> 6608.52]  I've been checking it every day.
[6609.14 --> 6609.62]  Really?
[6609.94 --> 6615.28]  Which is the most played games on Steam, because it has the current players one.
[6615.72 --> 6619.10]  So, it is interesting that Counter-Strike and Dota are like always here.
[6619.26 --> 6620.30]  Team Fortress 2...
[6620.30 --> 6620.62]  Oh, yeah.
[6620.66 --> 6621.10]  You can see it.
[6621.26 --> 6624.60]  Team Fortress 2 is like almost always in the top 10, which I actually found pretty interesting
[6624.60 --> 6624.98]  as well.
[6624.98 --> 6634.04]  But this little battle has been really interesting to watch, because Baldur's Gate 3 has been
[6634.04 --> 6637.04]  consistently winning for a while now.
[6637.16 --> 6641.46]  I think it took like three days after Starfield's release for Baldur's Gate to pass it again.
[6641.58 --> 6642.82]  And it's not even close right now.
[6642.82 --> 6644.00]  And it's not close.
[6644.08 --> 6648.80]  It's been roughly half when jumping down to Starfield for a while now.
[6648.80 --> 6653.72]  So, and Baldur's Gate 3 came out, what, like a month beforehand?
[6655.26 --> 6664.18]  In fairness, fans of the genre have been more starved for Baldur's Gate.
[6664.18 --> 6670.88]  When's the last time we got a Dungeons & Dragons-esque RPG?
[6672.34 --> 6674.96]  My understanding is the second Dragon Age sucked.
[6675.56 --> 6681.26]  A lot, there was a lot of criticism of even the first Dragon Age, that it was only, it
[6681.26 --> 6682.14]  was pretty normie.
[6682.58 --> 6684.78]  So, you'd have to go all the way back to what?
[6684.90 --> 6687.26]  Like Neverwinter Nights 2 or something stupid like that?
[6687.28 --> 6688.88]  There's a bunch of, one of the reasons why I've been...
[6688.88 --> 6689.42]  There's more indie ones.
[6690.02 --> 6690.28]  Mm-hmm.
[6690.56 --> 6690.80]  Mm-hmm.
[6691.80 --> 6693.36]  But like...
[6693.36 --> 6695.48]  And like, you could say Divinity Original Sin 2.
[6695.74 --> 6696.00]  Okay.
[6696.24 --> 6697.52]  But not really.
[6697.94 --> 6699.06]  Is it kind of like Dragon Age?
[6699.14 --> 6700.08]  I haven't played that one.
[6700.14 --> 6701.40]  So, is it kind of like Dragon Age?
[6701.54 --> 6702.76]  Where it's like kind of-ish?
[6703.00 --> 6703.30]  Yeah.
[6703.62 --> 6703.82]  Yeah.
[6704.62 --> 6707.58]  Whereas like hardcore D&D freaking rules...
[6707.58 --> 6708.78]  I want my dice rolls.
[6708.90 --> 6710.06]  It's been a long time.
[6710.24 --> 6710.96]  Yeah, I think so.
[6711.12 --> 6716.14]  And that space has grown exponentially since then.
[6716.26 --> 6718.46]  And, okay, a whole bunch of people are jumping on me.
[6718.46 --> 6720.22]  I didn't say any of the reasons why.
[6720.32 --> 6721.92]  I've just been saying it's been very interesting to me.
[6721.92 --> 6723.66]  People are saying it's on Game Pass.
[6724.08 --> 6725.60]  Game Pass isn't going to show up on Steam.
[6725.80 --> 6726.36]  Yeah, I know.
[6726.46 --> 6726.86]  I agree.
[6727.10 --> 6728.68]  I just find it very interesting.
[6728.92 --> 6729.30]  That's all.
[6729.70 --> 6733.04]  And the thing, too, to understand is we're looking at an apples-to-apples number, right?
[6733.48 --> 6737.82]  Luke is comparing the Steam numbers to the Steam numbers.
[6738.04 --> 6738.94]  So, yes.
[6739.00 --> 6741.16]  What they're saying, though, is that these...
[6741.16 --> 6743.10]  Like Baldur's Gate 3 isn't on Game Pass.
[6743.26 --> 6743.58]  I know.
[6743.70 --> 6747.98]  If it was on Game Pass, the amount of people playing on Steam would probably be lower, etc., etc., etc.
[6747.98 --> 6751.48]  But I still just find it very interesting.
[6751.68 --> 6759.08]  Because if you asked people how this was going to play out two months ago, even with, you know, Baldur's Gate 3 was in pre-release.
[6759.22 --> 6761.36]  People knew it was a great game, stuff like that.
[6761.42 --> 6763.40]  I still bet you they would have said Starfield would be higher.
[6763.40 --> 6764.56]  Oh, I don't know that I would have.
[6764.56 --> 6767.56]  But then, honestly, for me, I find...
[6768.10 --> 6770.30]  Like, I'd be bringing my own personal biases to that.
[6770.38 --> 6774.74]  It wouldn't be based on, you know, some kind of market research I've done or anything like that.
[6774.82 --> 6779.14]  It would just be based on that, to me, Starfield is a way less interesting game.
[6780.16 --> 6781.34]  I'm just like, yeah, okay.
[6781.82 --> 6783.42]  I really like...
[6783.42 --> 6787.10]  Starfield itches that part of my brain that Bethesda games have always itched.
[6787.34 --> 6788.38]  I love Starfield.
[6788.64 --> 6789.74]  Huge fan of it so far.
[6790.28 --> 6793.28]  Baldur's Gate 3, I think, is just, like, gonna be Game of the Year.
[6793.28 --> 6794.76]  It's an incredible game.
[6795.50 --> 6796.82]  Okay, maybe I'll have to play it.
[6796.90 --> 6797.60]  It's fantastic.
[6798.18 --> 6799.22]  Very good for co-op.
[6799.54 --> 6800.88]  Four-player, up to four-player co-op.
[6801.00 --> 6802.82]  You know what I've been really disappointed by?
[6804.16 --> 6804.96]  Sea of Stars.
[6805.50 --> 6805.88]  Really?
[6806.06 --> 6807.36]  Speaking of starry games.
[6807.66 --> 6807.98]  Oh.
[6808.38 --> 6808.70]  Yeah.
[6809.34 --> 6810.84]  That actually kind of sucks to hear.
[6810.98 --> 6813.76]  I was really excited to play it.
[6814.06 --> 6818.78]  I kind of blitzed through a little bit of the end of Chained Echoes to kind of get through it
[6818.78 --> 6820.24]  so that I could pick up Sea of Stars.
[6820.24 --> 6822.48]  Um...
[6822.48 --> 6828.28]  And I've been a lot more harsh on it to anyone who's talked to me about it over the last week
[6828.28 --> 6829.94]  and a half or however long it's been.
[6829.98 --> 6832.14]  Had I mentioned that I'd started playing it last WAN show?
[6832.16 --> 6833.62]  I can't remember exactly when I picked it up.
[6833.64 --> 6837.78]  I think you might have said that you were going to be playing, like, this weekend or something.
[6837.80 --> 6838.32]  Okay, sure.
[6838.38 --> 6839.34]  But I don't think you had said you were playing it.
[6839.34 --> 6843.32]  So anyone I've talked to this week about it, I've been way more harsh.
[6843.32 --> 6852.32]  But I think I had a bit of a lightbulb moment last night when I realized it's a great game for kids.
[6853.64 --> 6854.98]  It's really simple.
[6855.92 --> 6857.36]  It's beautiful.
[6857.68 --> 6859.10]  It is absolutely beautiful.
[6859.28 --> 6864.34]  It's one of the most beautiful 16-bit games I've ever seen.
[6864.64 --> 6867.04]  I actually can't think of one that's more beautiful.
[6867.30 --> 6867.44]  There.
[6867.44 --> 6869.52]  It's the most beautiful 16-bit game I've ever seen.
[6870.68 --> 6872.70]  The music is incredible.
[6873.86 --> 6876.44]  And you can just...
[6877.74 --> 6880.64]  Sometimes people want a chill, relaxed game.
[6880.66 --> 6883.12]  You can look at concept art and you can listen to the soundtrack, I guess.
[6883.18 --> 6886.68]  Because you don't really need to play the game, in my opinion.
[6886.94 --> 6888.56]  Unless, yeah, you're...
[6888.56 --> 6890.34]  Well, see, here's the thing.
[6890.42 --> 6892.30]  It's not even really chill.
[6892.30 --> 6900.80]  I actually find that it requires a significantly higher degree of user intervention and attentiveness
[6900.80 --> 6905.58]  than something like a classic Final Fantasy game or something like a Chained Echoes,
[6905.64 --> 6907.00]  which conveniently I just played.
[6907.10 --> 6909.14]  So I'm doing kind of like a side-to-side comparison here.
[6909.34 --> 6913.30]  Because the combat is very quick-time event heavy.
[6913.66 --> 6918.22]  So you have to, like, complete rhythmic button-mashing segments.
[6918.22 --> 6921.42]  And you have to be paying really close attention to these combo breaks.
[6921.42 --> 6923.48]  And it's...
[6923.48 --> 6925.24]  I find it really tedious.
[6925.98 --> 6941.32]  And as someone who actually enjoys the BS of, like, micromanaging my equipment and my relics
[6941.32 --> 6946.92]  and my upgrade progression and my skill set and stuff like that, it has basically none of it.
[6947.40 --> 6948.26]  You have a weapon.
[6948.48 --> 6949.72]  You have an armor slot.
[6949.72 --> 6952.70]  You have two accessory slots and then one other one.
[6952.82 --> 6954.08]  I forget what the crap it is.
[6954.14 --> 6955.80]  But it's basically something else.
[6955.96 --> 6958.62]  So the looting is totally unrewarding.
[6958.74 --> 6959.34]  You just...
[6959.34 --> 6960.58]  You might pick up a better one.
[6960.58 --> 6962.14]  I don't like when armor is one thing.
[6962.46 --> 6963.78]  You might pick up a better whatever.
[6964.16 --> 6965.76]  But there's no set combos.
[6966.22 --> 6967.78]  There's no...
[6967.78 --> 6969.44]  There's no status effects.
[6970.72 --> 6971.72]  There's no poison.
[6971.90 --> 6974.16]  There's no, like, burn.
[6974.16 --> 6978.02]  There's no, like, attack up, defense up.
[6978.26 --> 6979.34]  There's no buffs.
[6980.12 --> 6983.46]  How can you have a combat system without buffs?
[6983.76 --> 6984.34]  Yeah, it's a little weird.
[6984.40 --> 6988.22]  There's weaknesses, but the weaknesses are sort of randomly balanced.
[6988.32 --> 6991.20]  I think they said one of the first patches is going to address some balance issues.
[6991.26 --> 6993.34]  I don't know exactly what balance issues they're going to address.
[6993.34 --> 6998.18]  But I also found the exploration really unrewarding.
[6998.70 --> 7001.94]  I had a segment last night because I was talking to David about it where I was saying,
[7002.02 --> 7004.18]  yeah, I'm, like, actually kind of disappointed by it,
[7004.18 --> 7010.24]  where it sort of summed up exactly what my problem was with the game.
[7010.44 --> 7017.16]  You come to this door and there's two, like, spots that you obviously have to put something in.
[7017.16 --> 7024.58]  And then what you do in order to open the door is you go and you journey, like, one screen over to the right
[7024.58 --> 7027.44]  and you pick up a thing and you bring it back and you put it in the door.
[7027.90 --> 7033.92]  And then you go one screen over to the right and then there's a little, like, ledge that you have to slowly scoot across.
[7034.86 --> 7037.76]  And then you get to a thing and then you jump down a thing and you pick up a thing
[7037.76 --> 7040.72]  and then you bring it back and you put it in the other side of the door.
[7042.44 --> 7043.18]  No puzzle.
[7044.10 --> 7044.92]  No fight.
[7044.92 --> 7046.12]  I have a...
[7046.12 --> 7049.10]  Just wasting my fucking time to open the door.
[7049.10 --> 7055.78]  I'm going to avoid saying what it is because discussing it too directly is going to be a big spoiler for Starfield.
[7055.98 --> 7059.14]  But there's a thing that you end up needing to do multiple times,
[7059.30 --> 7064.30]  which it's like you know it's supposed to be this big epic moment.
[7064.88 --> 7065.28]  Yeah.
[7065.70 --> 7069.40]  Because of how the audio works and all this other kind of stuff and you have to do it multiple times.
[7069.64 --> 7072.90]  But it's, like, identical every time.
[7072.90 --> 7078.20]  And the first time you do it you're like, whoa, like, what's the puzzle I'm going to have to do or something like that.
[7078.30 --> 7084.40]  And then it's just incredibly, like, brain-dead simple and also very tedious.
[7084.74 --> 7088.32]  And then you have to do it every single time and it's like, oh, man.
[7088.56 --> 7088.80]  Okay.
[7089.14 --> 7090.82]  Yeah, people are already saying there's a mod for that.
[7091.08 --> 7091.60]  There is.
[7092.90 --> 7093.96]  But there shouldn't be.
[7094.08 --> 7094.36]  Yeah.
[7094.50 --> 7095.24]  There shouldn't have to be.
[7095.24 --> 7099.66]  I think you brought that up because I got my first ultimate move in Sea of Stars.
[7100.58 --> 7113.04]  And two weeks ago I would have said, I can't think of a single person who watched the summons in Final Fantasy VII and thought,
[7113.20 --> 7116.22]  what a great gameplay experience.
[7116.34 --> 7116.98]  He's mentioned this.
[7116.98 --> 7122.52]  I've never played Final Fantasy VII, but I know that apparently I'm going to hate the summons if I ever do.
[7122.86 --> 7124.50]  But I can think of one person.
[7125.20 --> 7128.64]  Whoever the creative director is for Sea of Stars.
[7129.18 --> 7131.10]  Because I kid you not.
[7131.66 --> 7136.38]  Once you press ultimate, you can basically, like, put down.
[7136.52 --> 7137.82]  I'm playing on the ROG Ally.
[7137.82 --> 7140.72]  So you can put down your game console.
[7140.90 --> 7142.08]  You can put down your controller.
[7142.38 --> 7147.40]  You can, like, go grab a bag of chips or something or a drink from the fridge and come back.
[7147.78 --> 7149.40]  And it might not be done yet.
[7149.90 --> 7153.14]  It is so long.
[7153.20 --> 7154.98]  And as far as I can tell, it's not skippable.
[7156.50 --> 7159.04]  Just, just stupid.
[7159.56 --> 7159.64]  Yeah.
[7159.64 --> 7168.94]  Just, just bad, bad design that was bad when Final Fantasy VII did it, like, 20 years ago.
[7169.76 --> 7171.96]  Yeah, when did Final Fantasy VII come out, actually?
[7172.04 --> 7173.60]  Yeah, man, yeah, like 20 years ago.
[7174.22 --> 7175.96]  And so I, um...
[7175.96 --> 7181.72]  My thing with Starfield and Baldur's Gate 3 right now is, um, I love both of them.
[7181.78 --> 7182.80]  They're both amazing games.
[7183.84 --> 7187.84]  Starfield, I could talk about my criticisms of it for a day.
[7187.84 --> 7192.68]  Like, Baldur's Gate 3, I have one singular criticism for it.
[7193.36 --> 7193.72]  One.
[7194.62 --> 7197.40]  And it's, like, definitely not game-breaking.
[7197.58 --> 7199.64]  I think it would just make the experience a little bit better.
[7200.00 --> 7205.10]  And honestly, uh, they've talked about how, like, people are begging them to release DLC for it
[7205.10 --> 7206.14]  because it's just such an amazing game.
[7206.20 --> 7206.90]  They want more content.
[7207.08 --> 7207.24]  Yeah.
[7207.60 --> 7212.40]  Um, and they could totally, like, bring it into one of those if they wanted to.
[7212.60 --> 7213.06]  But they also...
[7213.06 --> 7215.04]  Yeah, games as a service or whatever seasons or...
[7215.04 --> 7215.24]  Need to.
[7215.74 --> 7217.66]  Oh, no, I'm saying, like, this feature that I want.
[7217.66 --> 7223.54]  Basically, the only thing that I don't like about Baldur's Gate 3, uh, and this was brought
[7223.54 --> 7228.00]  up by Plouffe, um, and I had already had this, like, feeling, but he described it better.
[7228.38 --> 7233.06]  Um, but when you're running around with your characters, you have four characters if you're
[7233.06 --> 7233.74]  playing single-player.
[7234.24 --> 7238.54]  Um, and then you have however many people following you that you don't have players if
[7238.54 --> 7239.14]  you're playing multiplayer.
[7239.30 --> 7241.54]  Or if you're playing full multiplayer, you just have your four people.
[7241.54 --> 7247.42]  But the person that starts the event or conversation or whatever thing pulls you into the, like,
[7247.84 --> 7252.94]  you have to do dice rolls and conversation stuff thing, whatever character is there first
[7252.94 --> 7254.78]  is the one that has to deal with the entire thing.
[7255.42 --> 7261.26]  But if you're thinking about it, if you're in, like, a party in an actual D&D game, and
[7261.26 --> 7265.94]  your whole party is standing there, and there's, like, someone pinned under a tree, you would
[7265.94 --> 7266.94]  use your strength character.
[7267.74 --> 7272.10]  But in Baldur's Gate 3, if it was your, like, low-strength intelligence character that runs
[7272.10 --> 7275.24]  up first, then they're the person that has to do the check.
[7275.88 --> 7276.06]  Yeah.
[7276.06 --> 7277.94]  Or they're the person that has to handle the conversation.
[7277.94 --> 7278.14]  Yeah.
[7278.20 --> 7278.88]  Or whatever else.
[7279.04 --> 7283.94]  So it would be cooler if, as long as they were in some amount of reasonable range,
[7283.94 --> 7285.10]  because you can split the party.
[7285.18 --> 7286.62]  So if the party split, this shouldn't work.
[7286.62 --> 7291.84]  But if the party's all together and close, you should be able to use the correct person
[7291.84 --> 7292.40]  in your party.
[7292.80 --> 7293.86]  That would be cool.
[7294.06 --> 7297.72]  But also, it's pretty unimportant.
[7298.30 --> 7298.50]  Yeah.
[7298.66 --> 7302.98]  And it's so unimportant that I didn't even, like, fully flesh out the thought that I didn't
[7302.98 --> 7304.92]  like that part and was just like, this game's amazing.
[7305.30 --> 7307.62]  Because it's, like, not really that big of a deal.
[7307.76 --> 7311.58]  Because the way that I do it is I just lead with my charisma character if I'm in a town.
[7312.22 --> 7315.22]  And I just lead with my, like, tankier characters if I'm not in a town.
[7315.34 --> 7316.30]  And it mostly solves a problem.
[7316.30 --> 7317.30]  Basically, you just got good.
[7317.72 --> 7318.04]  Basically.
[7318.24 --> 7319.34]  And everyone else should just get good.
[7319.42 --> 7319.94]  Pretty much.
[7320.04 --> 7321.18]  Toxic gamer moment right here.
[7321.66 --> 7322.22]  This guy.
[7322.72 --> 7324.80]  But they could, like, yeah.
[7324.92 --> 7325.18]  All right.
[7325.22 --> 7326.56]  Want to hit us with another merch message?
[7326.66 --> 7327.92]  Someone said, you can change, can't you?
[7327.96 --> 7329.22]  Yeah, I might also just be a noob.
[7329.36 --> 7329.78]  I don't know.
[7330.20 --> 7331.24]  But that's my only criticism.
[7331.38 --> 7332.34]  Get gooder than Luke.
[7332.74 --> 7333.00]  Yeah.
[7333.10 --> 7333.42]  Basically.
[7333.68 --> 7333.86]  Yeah.
[7334.72 --> 7336.48]  Hello, WAN.DLL.
[7336.96 --> 7341.52]  Does Linus or Luke think we will ever see a game console that has upgradable graphics cards?
[7341.76 --> 7343.98]  Nintendo technically did that with the N64.
[7344.26 --> 7344.38]  No.
[7344.46 --> 7345.48]  It wasn't a graphics card.
[7345.48 --> 7349.30]  Well, it did augment the graphics subsystem.
[7349.74 --> 7350.02]  Okay.
[7351.08 --> 7352.42]  It wasn't a graphics card, though.
[7352.42 --> 7353.46]  Was there a PCB in it?
[7355.38 --> 7356.02]  It wasn't.
[7356.08 --> 7356.40]  It wasn't.
[7356.80 --> 7357.92]  Just answer the question.
[7358.56 --> 7359.38]  Technically, yes.
[7359.56 --> 7359.88]  Okay.
[7360.82 --> 7362.28]  Then was it a graphics card?
[7362.48 --> 7363.64]  What specifically was it?
[7363.64 --> 7364.46]  It was just memory, right?
[7364.74 --> 7365.26]  I don't remember.
[7365.36 --> 7365.80]  It doesn't matter.
[7367.36 --> 7367.76]  Nintendo.
[7367.76 --> 7368.20]  No.
[7368.66 --> 7369.86]  Was it a graphics card?
[7370.06 --> 7370.34]  No.
[7371.04 --> 7373.08]  I mean, did it have a PCB in it?
[7373.70 --> 7374.94]  I'm going to try to find it.
[7374.98 --> 7375.98]  Did it have a finger connector?
[7376.28 --> 7377.08]  Hold on.
[7377.20 --> 7377.52]  All right.
[7377.58 --> 7377.72]  Yeah.
[7377.80 --> 7378.38]  Just let's just.
[7378.52 --> 7379.48]  Why don't you just look it up?
[7379.54 --> 7379.70]  Fine.
[7379.74 --> 7380.20]  Just look it up.
[7380.36 --> 7381.64]  World's first eGPU.
[7381.64 --> 7383.98]  I'm trying to remember what it was.
[7384.28 --> 7385.52]  I could just be totally wrong.
[7386.94 --> 7389.50]  The Nintendo 64 expansion pack was an add-on for the Nintendo.
[7389.50 --> 7389.82]  Whoa.
[7390.50 --> 7391.36]  What just loaded?
[7392.64 --> 7393.18]  Get wrecked.
[7393.40 --> 7397.60]  A giant ad that scrolled the entire page and moved the thing I was reading completely off
[7397.60 --> 7397.82]  the page.
[7397.82 --> 7399.06]  Better than a giant subtract.
[7399.24 --> 7400.76]  Then you'd be left with nothing.
[7400.76 --> 7407.72]  The Nintendo 64 expansion pack was an add-on for the Nintendo 64 that doubled the amount
[7407.72 --> 7410.62]  of RAM the N64 had to 8 megabytes.
[7410.98 --> 7411.26]  Nice.
[7411.54 --> 7412.06]  Yeah.
[7412.78 --> 7417.46]  This allowed for greater resolution, longer draw distance, and more detailed graphics.
[7417.82 --> 7419.74]  But it's just more RAM.
[7420.14 --> 7420.42]  Okay.
[7420.54 --> 7420.72]  Fine.
[7420.92 --> 7421.16]  You win.
[7421.62 --> 7422.34]  Memory expansion.
[7422.34 --> 7425.00]  So then Star Fox for Super Nintendo.
[7425.30 --> 7426.34]  Is it a graphics card?
[7428.16 --> 7428.60]  Yuck!
[7428.60 --> 7429.20]  Is that...
[7429.20 --> 7430.60]  I thought it...
[7430.60 --> 7432.76]  Oh, God.
[7433.10 --> 7434.42]  I wish I thought of that.
[7434.62 --> 7435.62]  Oh, that's good.
[7436.30 --> 7436.74]  I don't know.
[7436.88 --> 7438.26]  I was mostly just bugging you.
[7439.56 --> 7439.92]  Oh!
[7440.68 --> 7444.58]  We should do one more merch message, because I haven't even told people what the new stuff
[7444.58 --> 7445.22]  on the show is.
[7445.26 --> 7448.76]  We haven't even shown the reversible bomber jacket and the merino t-shirt yet.
[7448.96 --> 7449.70]  Oh, it's reversible?
[7450.08 --> 7451.06]  Yeah, it's reversible.
[7451.06 --> 7452.14]  I saw that there was an orange one.
[7452.18 --> 7453.16]  I thought it was just a different product.
[7453.26 --> 7453.58]  Nah, dog.
[7453.60 --> 7454.06]  That's cool.
[7454.22 --> 7455.14]  I haven't seen these before.
[7455.16 --> 7455.66]  Do you want to check it out?
[7455.86 --> 7456.26]  Yeah, sure.
[7456.48 --> 7456.74]  All right.
[7457.02 --> 7460.54]  I wouldn't let Luke look at it before the show, so he gets to experience them
[7460.54 --> 7460.74]  now.
[7460.88 --> 7461.28]  Oh, hi.
[7464.10 --> 7464.88]  Oh, oh, oh.
[7464.96 --> 7465.34]  There we go.
[7465.52 --> 7466.16]  He's trying.
[7467.56 --> 7468.60]  He's really good at this.
[7468.60 --> 7475.04]  So it's like a sort of slightly puffy bomber style jacket.
[7475.60 --> 7479.44]  There's ever so subtle orange accenting on the LTT on the front of it.
[7479.52 --> 7481.42]  You can barely catch it from the side.
[7481.56 --> 7483.04]  It's on the edge a little bit.
[7483.10 --> 7484.82]  Yeah, so you can see it's slightly better there.
[7484.86 --> 7485.52]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[7486.64 --> 7487.80]  I like that it's subtle.
[7488.76 --> 7491.72]  And it's kind of hard.
[7491.80 --> 7493.62]  You're not able to really stand up, so you can't really.
[7493.72 --> 7494.12]  Okay, sure.
[7494.20 --> 7495.04]  Yeah, you can kind of see the bottom.
[7495.24 --> 7496.34]  And then go ahead and reverse it.
[7496.74 --> 7497.74]  The reverse side is super cool.
[7497.76 --> 7498.02]  Okay, hold on.
[7498.50 --> 7502.72]  This one, if you're wondering what fit, this one's a little big on me because this is a
[7502.72 --> 7504.38]  2XL and I'm normally a 1XL.
[7504.44 --> 7504.78]  Oh, okay.
[7505.16 --> 7506.70]  Sorry, I guess they brought you the wrong stuff.
[7506.82 --> 7509.74]  I'm just saying because people are seeing it, so I want to make it clear that like.
[7509.88 --> 7512.14]  You are clearly new to reversible garments.
[7512.14 --> 7515.80]  You've got to pull the sleeve while you take it off.
[7515.80 --> 7516.60]  That's the key.
[7516.78 --> 7517.48]  That's the trick.
[7518.40 --> 7519.46]  Now, let's see.
[7519.54 --> 7521.66]  Let's see how many people notice this.
[7524.44 --> 7525.72]  I'm really excited for this.
[7525.80 --> 7528.64]  The tag, by the way, that is on the outside right now is a removable tag.
[7528.70 --> 7529.44]  It just rips off.
[7530.56 --> 7530.96]  Okay.
[7531.68 --> 7532.30]  Let's see.
[7532.44 --> 7533.84]  Let's see how many people notice.
[7534.22 --> 7534.72]  Just give them.
[7534.94 --> 7536.74]  It's more orange in person.
[7536.92 --> 7537.96]  I will say that right now.
[7538.04 --> 7540.04]  Dan, is this color accurate, this display here?
[7540.06 --> 7540.84]  Oh, my God.
[7542.08 --> 7542.52]  No.
[7542.84 --> 7543.16]  Okay.
[7543.52 --> 7545.18]  It's very vibrant orange.
[7545.18 --> 7549.54]  I looked over there at actual Luke, and that is extremely orange.
[7549.68 --> 7549.80]  Yeah.
[7549.94 --> 7553.32]  The oh, my God is because the difference is quite striking.
[7553.46 --> 7558.38]  It's quite like kind of peachy in the camera feed, but it is orange.
[7558.62 --> 7560.46]  This is almost like security orange.
[7560.68 --> 7560.88]  Yes.
[7561.02 --> 7563.68]  It's almost like it's blowing out the camera, at least on this monitor.
[7563.88 --> 7564.56]  It's very orange.
[7564.66 --> 7564.82]  Okay.
[7565.00 --> 7565.16]  Wow.
[7565.16 --> 7566.06]  So hold still for a second.
[7566.14 --> 7567.16]  Let's see if anybody notices.
[7567.78 --> 7568.92]  Let's see if Luke notices.
[7569.42 --> 7570.12]  Notice what?
[7570.88 --> 7572.34]  Do you notice anything?
[7572.34 --> 7573.66]  Just see if you notice anything.
[7574.78 --> 7576.48]  Is the stitching LTT or something?
[7576.48 --> 7576.58]  Yeah.
[7576.82 --> 7577.10]  Oh.
[7577.60 --> 7579.06]  The whole thing is LTT.
[7579.42 --> 7580.70]  I couldn't actually like tell.
[7580.74 --> 7581.72]  Oh, I can see it now.
[7581.80 --> 7582.90]  On the sleeve, there's a T.
[7582.98 --> 7583.30]  Yeah.
[7583.62 --> 7583.88]  Yeah.
[7583.88 --> 7584.56]  Cool, right?
[7585.60 --> 7586.96]  This is a ridiculous company.
[7587.22 --> 7587.44]  Yeah.
[7587.56 --> 7588.96]  Who thinks of stuff like that?
[7589.02 --> 7589.58]  That's nuts.
[7589.84 --> 7591.74]  I actually don't remember who thought of that.
[7591.92 --> 7593.02]  I think that's pretty cool.
[7593.02 --> 7593.44]  What the heck?
[7593.44 --> 7594.00]  Brilliant idea.
[7594.42 --> 7594.78]  Amazing.
[7595.04 --> 7595.68]  Oh, I can see it.
[7595.70 --> 7595.80]  Yeah.
[7595.84 --> 7597.96]  Now that I actually like look at it, I can see it.
[7598.06 --> 7599.22]  Wearing it is a little hard.
[7599.64 --> 7600.76]  Oh, you can see it on the sleeves though.
[7600.80 --> 7600.96]  Yeah.
[7601.26 --> 7601.42]  Yeah.
[7601.64 --> 7601.96]  So.
[7602.46 --> 7604.94]  I actually like the like quilted appearance.
[7605.04 --> 7606.10]  I don't know if that's the right term, but.
[7606.22 --> 7606.40]  Yeah.
[7606.40 --> 7607.64]  It's like a puffy kind of.
[7608.00 --> 7608.10]  Yeah.
[7608.24 --> 7608.44]  Yeah.
[7608.44 --> 7609.38]  It looks all right.
[7609.82 --> 7610.04]  Yeah.
[7610.04 --> 7612.48]  So that's available on the site right now.
[7612.48 --> 7616.72]  And we are also launching our Merino t-shirt.
[7616.90 --> 7618.90]  So this is a wool t-shirt.
[7619.46 --> 7622.20]  The benefits of Merino wool are several.
[7622.20 --> 7624.26]  Let's see if we, yeah, here we go.
[7624.36 --> 7624.60]  All right.
[7624.66 --> 7626.54]  Here, we'll just flip over to the site here.
[7626.98 --> 7631.26]  Our LTT Merino wool t-shirt where comfort meets performance in one extraordinary tee.
[7631.56 --> 7635.50]  It's comfortable, light, and keeps its shape with excellent moisture wicking properties
[7635.50 --> 7638.96]  to keep you feeling fresh, even in a hardcore cod session.
[7639.12 --> 7642.96]  Merino wool also helps with temperature regulation and minimizes odors.
[7643.70 --> 7645.36]  It's kind of an amazing material.
[7645.36 --> 7650.68]  I've wanted to do something with Merino wool ever since I got my Merino wool socks that I
[7650.68 --> 7651.38]  absolutely love.
[7652.20 --> 7653.54]  It's a super simple tee.
[7653.86 --> 7656.76]  It's black, but it is Merino.
[7657.56 --> 7659.58]  It is indeed a t-shirt that is black.
[7659.78 --> 7661.36]  There's the only logos down here.
[7661.92 --> 7662.12]  Yeah.
[7662.24 --> 7663.94]  That's a tiny little, tiny little logo.
[7664.12 --> 7666.96]  We're trying to keep, we're trying to keep things, you know, subtle, right?
[7667.30 --> 7670.30]  Like even the, even the bomber jacket, it's like, yeah, sure.
[7670.36 --> 7673.54]  It has LTTs all over it, but if you don't know what you're looking for, you might never
[7673.54 --> 7674.40]  actually notice it.
[7674.82 --> 7675.06]  Yeah.
[7676.62 --> 7679.60]  LTT has become a clothing line that sponsors a tech hobby.
[7679.70 --> 7680.46]  What a dream come true.
[7680.52 --> 7681.00]  I know, right?
[7681.00 --> 7684.40]  Um, uh, someone said, do you actually do big sizes now?
[7684.48 --> 7686.18]  We don't do tall.
[7686.84 --> 7688.22]  Not yet, but we're working on it.
[7688.44 --> 7688.68]  Yeah.
[7688.92 --> 7689.16]  Yeah.
[7689.22 --> 7689.76]  We are.
[7689.92 --> 7690.78]  Work harder on it.
[7690.88 --> 7691.02]  Yeah.
[7691.06 --> 7692.36]  Our, uh, I know, I know.
[7692.46 --> 7697.32]  Well, part of the problem is that one of our, one of our fit people who's like really,
[7697.42 --> 7701.58]  really great, uh, was not in office for a very, very extended period of time.
[7701.58 --> 7704.86]  I can't give you guys any like personal details or anything about it.
[7705.20 --> 7706.10]  Uh, it's a good thing.
[7706.42 --> 7710.24]  It's a happy thing, but they were not in office for a very, very long time.
[7710.38 --> 7710.82]  This is nice.
[7710.84 --> 7715.18]  And they are very much in office now and very committed to getting our extended sizing going.
[7715.18 --> 7716.42]  So I'm really excited.
[7718.94 --> 7719.94]  All right.
[7720.36 --> 7720.64]  Yeah.
[7720.64 --> 7721.44]  So it's nice.
[7721.54 --> 7722.64]  It's, it's not cheap.
[7722.76 --> 7724.00]  It's a $60 shirt.
[7724.16 --> 7725.60]  Merino wool is like that.
[7726.00 --> 7726.54]  Go ahead.
[7727.74 --> 7728.58]  Price compare.
[7728.96 --> 7731.22]  Um, it's our shirt.
[7731.22 --> 7734.48]  So, you know, it's going to, the fit's going to be awesome and it's going to be comfortable.
[7734.48 --> 7736.90]  It's going to be, the quality is going to be great for some people.
[7737.08 --> 7737.78]  So it's our shirt.
[7737.86 --> 7738.02]  Yeah.
[7738.06 --> 7739.30]  Well, until we get to tall.
[7739.80 --> 7741.62]  But it's our shirt.
[7741.84 --> 7743.82]  So, you know, it's going to be good and it's Merino.
[7743.98 --> 7744.92]  So, you know, it's going to be Merino.
[7745.12 --> 7745.74]  So there you go.
[7746.14 --> 7746.82]  Uh, all right.
[7747.28 --> 7748.96]  Was there, oh, there was, oh, there's one.
[7749.06 --> 7749.48]  Oh, shoot.
[7749.62 --> 7752.98]  Hey, I can work out in an LTT shirt now.
[7753.02 --> 7753.28]  Yes, you can.
[7753.48 --> 7754.36]  Uh, oh, by the way.
[7754.44 --> 7754.94]  Makes sense.
[7755.04 --> 7755.86]  Uh, this is official.
[7757.58 --> 7757.94]  Yeah.
[7758.10 --> 7760.50]  The LTT retro screwdriver is coming.
[7760.50 --> 7761.86]  Level up your tool game.
[7761.92 --> 7762.84]  No coins required.
[7763.20 --> 7764.02]  Enter your email.
[7764.14 --> 7768.22]  All you got to do is go to lttstore.com slash pages slash retro dash sign up.
[7768.36 --> 7771.32]  So I'm going to drop that in the chat.
[7771.76 --> 7772.18]  Nice.
[7772.76 --> 7778.98]  I promise you we did actually think of this before it made its way to, uh, to Reddit.
[7779.22 --> 7781.06]  But, um, you know what?
[7781.18 --> 7784.86]  Hey, if you're some, if you're one of the people who posted this on Reddit, because more than,
[7784.86 --> 7789.92]  more than one person did come up with this, um, then you can, you can, you can give yourself
[7789.92 --> 7791.90]  a, you can give yourself a little pat on the back.
[7792.44 --> 7795.68]  Um, yeah, we're, we're very excited about this one.
[7796.14 --> 7800.62]  And then finally, we would like you guys to send us your favorite garment.
[7801.44 --> 7804.34]  Send us your favorite garment and tell us some of what you like about it.
[7804.38 --> 7806.28]  We're going to post that link in the chat as well.
[7806.46 --> 7807.42]  Go check it out.
[7807.42 --> 7813.26]  We just want to understand like what you guys wear, what you guys love, why you wear
[7813.26 --> 7817.56]  it, why you love it and kind of help, help guide us because obviously we have plenty
[7817.56 --> 7823.00]  of cool ideas on our own, but we're always open to new ones and really excited to, you
[7823.00 --> 7824.82]  know, build stuff that is, that is for you.
[7825.26 --> 7825.64]  Okay.
[7825.70 --> 7826.14]  That's it.
[7826.20 --> 7828.34]  That's all the, that's all the merge talk for this week.
[7828.58 --> 7828.96]  Yeah.
[7829.04 --> 7830.06]  Were we doing one more though?
[7830.06 --> 7834.02]  I think that was, um, Oh no, I think Dan put up two to three more topics.
[7834.02 --> 7837.82]  So why don't we talk about California passing right to repair?
[7837.98 --> 7838.72]  Hey, let's go.
[7839.42 --> 7844.02]  California is now the third U S state to pass right to repair laws for consumer appliances
[7844.02 --> 7846.34]  and electronics alongside New York and Minnesota.
[7846.60 --> 7850.16]  To be clear, it's not a law yet because it has yet to be signed by the governor, but he
[7850.16 --> 7852.96]  is a supporter of the bill and therefore will likely do so.
[7852.96 --> 7859.32]  The California bill requires that manufacturers retain repair parts, tools, manuals, and software
[7859.32 --> 7863.96]  documentation for at least three years post-production for products that are
[7863.96 --> 7868.98]  sold for between 50 and a hundred dollars and up to seven years for products over $100.
[7869.58 --> 7876.06]  It also bars manufacturers, so they cannot do it from charging independent repair technicians
[7876.06 --> 7879.40]  more for repair materials than they would their own repair network.
[7879.40 --> 7883.94]  Although I can already see how that might be, that might have some loopholes open in it
[7883.94 --> 7884.52]  for abuse.
[7884.88 --> 7886.48]  There are still a few carve outs.
[7886.98 --> 7891.98]  The new law won't stop manufacturers from creating software blocks to prevent third parties
[7891.98 --> 7893.04]  from fixing devices.
[7893.74 --> 7894.10]  Okay.
[7894.40 --> 7900.80]  Or from combining single parts into complex assemblies, which we have encountered before.
[7901.18 --> 7905.84]  I don't know if you remember this part of the iMac pro saga, but part of the reason that
[7905.84 --> 7910.82]  a replacement motherboard was so expensive was because Apple considered a motherboard plus
[7910.82 --> 7912.68]  the CPU plus RAM.
[7912.68 --> 7918.14]  I don't remember if it was the cooler as well, but like the motherboard was an assembly with
[7918.14 --> 7919.54]  the socketed CPU.
[7919.96 --> 7921.70]  How does that make any sense?
[7922.88 --> 7923.36]  Anyway.
[7924.62 --> 7928.44]  Right to repair advocates have been pleased overall though with the language of the new
[7928.44 --> 7934.26]  bill, but expressed concern about the involvement of Apple, who is a major backer of the bill.
[7934.26 --> 7939.74]  In a letter to the bill's sponsor, Senator Susan Eggman, Apple said that its support was
[7939.74 --> 7945.28]  contingent on continued protection of its intellectual property and certain restrictions on third
[7945.28 --> 7950.30]  party repair shops, like not permitting them to turn off its anti-theft remote locks and
[7950.30 --> 7953.72]  requiring them to disclose to customers when they use third party or secondhand parts.
[7953.80 --> 7958.06]  I mean, both of those things are fine, but we know for a fact that Apple has other less
[7958.06 --> 7961.94]  fine restrictions that they place on third party repair shops.
[7961.94 --> 7967.80]  According to Eggman's chief staff, Apple was involved early on in the development of the
[7967.80 --> 7971.44]  bill and participated in a very constructive manner.
[7972.88 --> 7973.36]  Okay.
[7973.76 --> 7973.88]  Yeah.
[7973.96 --> 7974.32]  Interesting.
[7974.76 --> 7978.56]  Every time there's like something passes for right to repair, there's a lot of asterisks.
[7979.44 --> 7979.62]  Cool.
[7980.20 --> 7984.08]  Apple has publicly framed its involvement as a way of maintaining its products longevity and
[7984.08 --> 7988.10]  their value over their expected lifetime, as well as increasing its customers access to
[7988.10 --> 7994.14]  safe, high quality repair options while also protecting their safety, security, and privacy.
[7994.96 --> 7998.68]  That's a very PR statement that means that they might have made it bad.
[7998.68 --> 7998.84]  All right.
[7998.90 --> 7999.24]  I'm a lot.
[7999.54 --> 8005.02]  I haven't read the bill, but I'm a lot less excited about this than I was before because
[8005.02 --> 8014.16]  Apple would go as far as to re-engineer the functioning of an SSD to make sure that you
[8014.16 --> 8017.26]  can't upgrade any other stuff in your system without losing all your data.
[8017.44 --> 8019.82]  That's actually the way that they behave.
[8020.52 --> 8022.56]  So cool then.
[8024.16 --> 8025.18]  In other news.
[8025.64 --> 8026.46]  Destiny 2?
[8026.72 --> 8027.22]  Yeah, yeah.
[8027.32 --> 8030.88]  Destiny 2 cheater legally barred from all Bungie games.
[8031.08 --> 8037.62]  A prolific Destiny 2 cheater has agreed to consent judgment in a U.S. court, barring him from
[8037.62 --> 8039.78]  ever playing a Bungie game ever again.
[8039.78 --> 8041.84]  How on earth could you enforce this?
[8042.06 --> 8042.96]  I have no idea.
[8043.02 --> 8043.26]  Okay.
[8043.42 --> 8044.24]  We'll get to that.
[8044.46 --> 8048.94]  The cheater, who was 17 at the start of the lawsuit, was found to have used cheat software
[8048.94 --> 8053.98]  extensively, evaded multiple bans, and harassed and threatened Bungie employees.
[8054.22 --> 8060.56]  He has also been ordered to pay Bungie half a million dollars in damages.
[8062.78 --> 8063.08]  Wow.
[8063.16 --> 8063.46]  Wow.
[8063.78 --> 8064.14]  Okay.
[8064.14 --> 8069.00]  He has likewise agreed to a restraining order, barring him from interacting with any current
[8069.00 --> 8076.68]  or future Bungie IP, harassing any Bungie employee or player of Bungie games, or knowingly traveling
[8076.68 --> 8082.74]  within a thousand feet of any Bungie office or any home occupied by Bungie employees.
[8082.86 --> 8088.28]  I don't know much about this person, and based on that they were 17 when this whole thing started,
[8088.28 --> 8091.14]  maybe their identity is not known.
[8091.50 --> 8092.96]  Do you guys know?
[8093.14 --> 8094.32]  Is the name out there?
[8094.42 --> 8095.46]  I don't know.
[8095.48 --> 8098.24]  But clearly some stuff went down.
[8098.40 --> 8098.86]  Yeah, really.
[8099.34 --> 8103.74]  This is the latest in a string of legal action Bungie has taken against cheaters and distributors
[8103.74 --> 8110.02]  of cheating software, including a $4.3 million judgment against a distributor, Aim Junkies,
[8110.08 --> 8110.80]  earlier this year.
[8111.44 --> 8117.50]  This specific case centered around one individual cheater appears to be highly unusual.
[8117.50 --> 8122.24]  However, some modders have expressed concern about the basis of which the decision was made.
[8122.58 --> 8131.52]  The $500,000 fine is in fact composed of 100 fines worth of $2,000 each for individual acts of ban evasion.
[8131.74 --> 8133.78]  100 ban evasion fines?
[8134.08 --> 8134.20]  Holy.
[8134.56 --> 8134.98]  Okay.
[8135.20 --> 8137.76]  So I think the prolific part was quite genuine.
[8138.26 --> 8143.96]  As well as a $300,000 fine for multiple instances of copyright infringement.
[8143.96 --> 8149.94]  This larger fine was based on the argument by Bungie that the cheaters use of code injection
[8149.94 --> 8157.38]  and graphical overlays qualified as creating an unauthorized derivative work in violation of federal copyright law.
[8157.38 --> 8157.66]  Okay.
[8157.70 --> 8159.02]  I don't know if I like that precedent.
[8159.42 --> 8161.42]  Maybe for multiplayer games.
[8163.70 --> 8164.42]  Oh.
[8164.98 --> 8167.30]  No, because Minecraft does that kind of stuff.
[8167.30 --> 8170.00]  Well, now hold on a second.
[8170.90 --> 8171.18]  Ugh.
[8171.42 --> 8172.46]  See, yeah, that's the thing.
[8172.46 --> 8180.48]  On the one hand, if there was a legal framework for pursuing individual cheaters in games,
[8181.34 --> 8184.50]  if cheating in games suddenly became illegal,
[8184.84 --> 8185.32]  That's sweet.
[8185.44 --> 8189.12]  I actually, like, I might be okay with that.
[8189.18 --> 8189.96]  Yeah, bring up the hammers.
[8189.96 --> 8193.00]  Because on the one hand, yeah, there's a lot of casual competition.
[8194.02 --> 8196.90]  But it's like, yeah, but fair enough then.
[8197.08 --> 8198.38]  Play a casual game with your friends.
[8198.44 --> 8202.08]  Play a custom game where everyone is on the same playing field and then it's fine.
[8202.58 --> 8205.46]  But people don't treat gaming like that.
[8206.88 --> 8211.96]  Often, like to a large degree, people do not treat gaming like just a casual thing where,
[8211.96 --> 8217.18]  you know, you can just noclip and wallhack or whatever, right?
[8217.18 --> 8220.92]  So in much the same way that they regulate professional sports,
[8221.52 --> 8228.46]  I don't see why cheating in games shouldn't be a thing that, yeah, is punishable.
[8229.12 --> 8232.14]  However, buh.
[8233.16 --> 8234.46]  This is...
[8234.46 --> 8237.84]  Running anything alongside the game suddenly being a derivative work,
[8237.84 --> 8241.90]  which, because remember, the law is a lot of the time centered around precedent, right?
[8241.94 --> 8243.50]  Not necessarily the original wording.
[8243.98 --> 8245.76]  This seems really dangerous.
[8245.76 --> 8249.78]  Yeah, and like people have brought up in chat, someone said,
[8249.92 --> 8251.50]  wow lets you modify your UI.
[8251.88 --> 8253.84]  Wow lets you do a lot of stuff with add-ons.
[8254.86 --> 8259.58]  I know there's add-ons for various other MMOs as well,
[8259.64 --> 8261.68]  even when they're not allowed by the developer.
[8262.14 --> 8264.64]  So that would now make that like criminal.
[8265.04 --> 8267.50]  And what if you're doing it for accessibility reasons,
[8267.50 --> 8272.72]  but you don't, you're not like, you don't have the, you know,
[8272.80 --> 8276.62]  the sign for your rearview mirror, but you like do kind of need it or something.
[8276.82 --> 8278.80]  Like I, gee.
[8279.40 --> 8280.06]  Yeah, that's really interesting.
[8280.06 --> 8282.14]  And it's one of those things where, you know, you guys might say,
[8282.24 --> 8285.04]  well, yeah, but Blizzard allows that or that, you know, whatever else.
[8285.72 --> 8286.80]  Well, right, right.
[8286.84 --> 8288.44]  But what if it's at their sole discretion?
[8288.44 --> 8291.42]  And sure, I don't know.
[8292.26 --> 8295.18]  This guy might have had it coming based on the 100.
[8295.50 --> 8296.56]  100 ban of agents.
[8296.74 --> 8297.10]  Fines.
[8297.30 --> 8297.46]  Yeah.
[8297.62 --> 8301.18]  You know, and all the restraining orders against Bungie employees and all that.
[8301.26 --> 8305.02]  Like, like I said, some stuff obviously went down here.
[8305.24 --> 8307.24]  Would need to know a lot more about what happened.
[8307.48 --> 8307.66]  Yeah.
[8307.66 --> 8314.98]  But based on, just based on people, you know, being people,
[8315.30 --> 8321.32]  do I trust every random gaming company whose game I buy on Steam or whatever
[8321.32 --> 8328.08]  to act in a consistent and benevolent way towards me?
[8328.18 --> 8328.42]  No.
[8328.48 --> 8329.06]  Yeah, not at all.
[8329.08 --> 8329.84]  Yeah, not even a little.
[8330.54 --> 8330.80]  Yeah.
[8330.94 --> 8334.84]  I like the idea of being able to crunch down on cheaters and multiplayer games.
[8334.84 --> 8339.28]  Um, but I'd be highly concerned about how this could be used outside of that.
[8339.42 --> 8339.70]  Okay.
[8339.96 --> 8341.60]  We need to revisit something I said before.
[8342.06 --> 8343.92]  Rolled Gold in floatplane chat says,
[8344.02 --> 8346.38]  cheating in a professional sport slash game should be illegal.
[8346.56 --> 8349.30]  But in casual play, making it illegal is going too far.
[8349.72 --> 8350.66]  But here's the thing.
[8351.24 --> 8352.86]  Who decides that the game is casual?
[8354.94 --> 8356.48]  That's not a unilateral decision.
[8357.26 --> 8361.16]  If you're playing a ranked Rocket League game and someone on the other side is cheating,
[8361.92 --> 8363.02]  that's non-consensual.
[8363.02 --> 8365.02]  You also are...
[8365.54 --> 8368.18]  You didn't consent to it being casual.
[8368.52 --> 8372.18]  You're trying to play the game in a ranked setting.
[8372.38 --> 8374.68]  And how do you define casual or competitive?
[8375.44 --> 8377.70]  Some people are talking about Tarkov in here.
[8378.00 --> 8379.68]  Tarkov doesn't have a competitive mode.
[8380.16 --> 8381.72]  Tarkov also doesn't have a casual mode.
[8381.72 --> 8383.74]  I think Tarkov is implicitly competitive.
[8383.74 --> 8384.44]  Tarkov is competitive.
[8384.44 --> 8385.40]  I think so as well.
[8385.44 --> 8386.60]  But it's not technically ranked.
[8386.68 --> 8387.60]  You just mentioned ranked.
[8387.82 --> 8388.60]  There's no rankings.
[8389.40 --> 8390.86]  Sure, but everything is ranked.
[8390.86 --> 8391.70]  It's just like very serious.
[8391.70 --> 8392.22]  Tarkov is a game.
[8392.22 --> 8392.82]  Okay.
[8392.82 --> 8392.94]  Okay.
[8392.94 --> 8393.02]  Okay.
[8393.02 --> 8393.08]  Okay.
[8393.08 --> 8393.14]  Okay.
[8393.14 --> 8394.14]  Okay.
[8394.14 --> 8399.00]  And honestly, as someone else also said in float plane chat, the amount of cheating
[8399.00 --> 8402.00]  in Tarkov ruined the game for me and now I don't play.
[8402.00 --> 8402.84]  So you can...
[8402.84 --> 8404.00]  It can directly...
[8404.00 --> 8406.24]  Even if it's a casual game.
[8406.24 --> 8408.20]  If you're playing...
[8408.20 --> 8410.68]  Warzone is ranked.
[8410.92 --> 8413.86]  If you're playing casual Counter-Strike, that is a thing.
[8413.86 --> 8419.12]  If you're playing casual Counter-Strike and every game you jump into, there's spin botters
[8419.12 --> 8421.14]  just auto-killing everyone on the map.
[8421.14 --> 8422.98]  You're not going to want to play the game anymore.
[8422.98 --> 8424.32]  You're not going to recommend it to anyone.
[8424.56 --> 8425.60]  It's a bad experience.
[8425.74 --> 8425.78]  Yeah.
[8425.80 --> 8430.46]  I think making the argument that cheating is theft is one that you could make your way
[8430.46 --> 8430.66]  to.
[8430.76 --> 8432.24]  Not everyone's going to agree with you.
[8432.80 --> 8433.68]  Is it theft?
[8433.92 --> 8436.16]  Well, it is the removal of...
[8436.16 --> 8437.66]  It is the loss of earnings.
[8437.66 --> 8440.68]  So it's some...
[8440.68 --> 8443.38]  You're going to have to come up with a name for it.
[8443.38 --> 8443.74]  Yeah.
[8443.92 --> 8448.62]  But it's definitely something that they might have had that now they don't have anymore.
[8448.78 --> 8449.52]  So is that theft?
[8449.62 --> 8449.74]  Yeah.
[8449.80 --> 8454.24]  Probably not by definition, but it's harmful.
[8454.54 --> 8454.78]  There.
[8455.40 --> 8456.46]  It's harmful.
[8457.84 --> 8459.90]  Someone said it's more like vandalism.
[8460.62 --> 8461.06]  Sure.
[8461.14 --> 8461.96]  Which is also illegal.
[8462.48 --> 8462.74]  Yeah.
[8463.04 --> 8463.34]  Yeah.
[8463.40 --> 8463.60]  Yeah.
[8463.72 --> 8464.16]  Vandalism.
[8464.28 --> 8465.10]  Who said that?
[8465.14 --> 8466.18]  That's a really good...
[8466.18 --> 8467.08]  Ram and robot.
[8467.08 --> 8468.10]  Good take.
[8468.26 --> 8468.70]  Good take.
[8470.62 --> 8472.10]  I've got people talking about how...
[8472.10 --> 8473.50]  Well, there is a casual mode for Rocket League.
[8473.58 --> 8473.94]  Well, sure.
[8474.06 --> 8474.30]  Fine.
[8474.38 --> 8474.62]  Cool.
[8475.54 --> 8477.16]  But cheating, that still...
[8477.16 --> 8477.84]  It still...
[8477.84 --> 8478.08]  Sucks.
[8478.14 --> 8478.96]  It still sucks.
[8480.00 --> 8484.64]  But if casual mode was allowed cheating, well then, yeah, sure.
[8484.72 --> 8484.92]  Fine.
[8484.98 --> 8485.92]  Then everyone can just play it.
[8485.94 --> 8490.08]  Everyone can just have their trainers on or whatever they call cheat clients these days.
[8493.82 --> 8494.22]  Yeah.
[8494.32 --> 8494.48]  No.
[8494.48 --> 8494.76]  I...
[8494.76 --> 8495.48]  I...
[8495.48 --> 8495.98]  I...
[8495.98 --> 8498.76]  I'm split on this one.
[8499.20 --> 8499.64]  I don't know.
[8499.74 --> 8500.14]  I don't know.
[8500.30 --> 8500.54]  I...
[8500.54 --> 8501.80]  I'm not a huge fan of...
[8501.80 --> 8505.20]  Of the precedent being set here, even though obviously some stuff went down.
[8505.24 --> 8505.32]  Yeah.
[8505.32 --> 8506.80]  I think the precedent is very concerning.
[8507.04 --> 8507.54]  But I...
[8507.54 --> 8509.58]  But again, we need to know more about the case.
[8509.64 --> 8518.38]  I am overall supportive of cheaters, especially those commercially benefiting from cheating being punished.
[8518.52 --> 8519.50]  I think it's not...
[8519.50 --> 8520.44]  It's not cool.
[8520.44 --> 8523.32]  Like if someone...
[8523.32 --> 8536.92]  Man, if someone made a device that your kid could wear to the playground and it immediately sucked all the fun out of the jungle gym for everyone else, would that...
[8536.92 --> 8538.76]  Would they be allowed to take that to school?
[8539.48 --> 8541.94]  Would those devices get banned if they just...
[8541.94 --> 8542.58]  You know, if they were like...
[8542.58 --> 8550.92]  If it was like a dementor, you know, hit everyone else on the jungle gym and it just completely removed the fun from their activity.
[8551.28 --> 8552.38]  Like I...
[8552.38 --> 8555.66]  It's one of those things where it's just like, is it illegal?
[8555.80 --> 8556.34]  Not illegal?
[8556.46 --> 8556.86]  I don't know.
[8556.86 --> 8562.26]  But obviously no one would be down with it and it wouldn't take long for people to be like, no, that's not cool and you shouldn't do that anymore.
[8565.20 --> 8572.66]  But for some reason, because we don't have to be face to face with people, cheating just keeps happening.
[8572.86 --> 8575.84]  Of course we're not qualified to talk about it.
[8576.34 --> 8579.92]  We can discuss our feelings on a matter.
[8580.22 --> 8580.34]  Yeah.
[8580.36 --> 8582.32]  Any gamer is qualified to talk about cheating.
[8582.46 --> 8582.56]  Yeah.
[8582.60 --> 8584.62]  We're not trying to say we're legal experts.
[8584.88 --> 8585.00]  Like...
[8585.00 --> 8585.14]  Nope.
[8585.14 --> 8587.14]  I have never said that.
[8587.40 --> 8587.86]  Chillax.
[8588.78 --> 8589.26]  Yeah.
[8592.80 --> 8593.48]  Um...
[8593.48 --> 8596.62]  Oh, very slight correction, by the way.
[8596.74 --> 8603.86]  Last week, during the Lenovo Legion Go story, I seemed to imply at one point that the ROG Ally was more powerful than the Legion Go.
[8603.98 --> 8605.00]  Full transparency, guys.
[8605.74 --> 8608.50]  Lenovo wasn't stoked on that, but that wasn't my intention.
[8608.70 --> 8611.70]  They have the same processor, the Ryzen Z1 Extreme.
[8611.70 --> 8615.40]  Uh, when I was talking about it, I was comparing the ROG Ally to the Steam Deck.
[8615.46 --> 8616.46]  I don't have a Legion Go.
[8616.88 --> 8618.54]  I have, I have not made any comparison.
[8618.68 --> 8621.88]  I was making comparisons between devices that I own and have used.
[8622.48 --> 8624.84]  Um, so, there's that.
[8625.30 --> 8632.10]  Also, I, I think there's an, uh, assumption among some people that we mean that this should result in jail time.
[8632.10 --> 8632.46]  No.
[8632.74 --> 8635.18]  Lots of things are illegal without resulting in jail time.
[8635.32 --> 8637.92]  Like, you're not allowed to park anywhere you want, but it's like, it's a fine.
[8638.02 --> 8638.72]  It's not jail time.
[8638.80 --> 8640.12]  It's a level of enforcement.
[8640.92 --> 8641.28]  Yes.
[8643.00 --> 8643.86]  Do you want to play a game?
[8645.10 --> 8645.44]  What?
[8645.66 --> 8645.88]  Sure.
[8646.66 --> 8647.44]  I'm going to cheat, though.
[8647.90 --> 8648.52]  You're going to cheat?
[8649.74 --> 8653.86]  Uh, actually, it's more of a game, it's more of a game with the community.
[8653.86 --> 8656.00]  Oh, yeah.
[8656.14 --> 8656.52]  I don't know.
[8656.58 --> 8657.56]  How are we going to pull this?
[8657.72 --> 8659.26]  I have no idea.
[8659.46 --> 8660.86]  I don't know if we can, because you...
[8662.08 --> 8663.10]  Yeah, I'm, I'm not sure.
[8663.10 --> 8664.62]  We'd have to do each one individually.
[8664.72 --> 8665.86]  I think that's going to take too long.
[8665.92 --> 8666.28]  Exactly.
[8667.22 --> 8668.40]  Why don't we have them pick a number?
[8668.66 --> 8670.26]  I could, I could, I could run them all consecutively.
[8671.30 --> 8675.16]  Mm, let's, no, let's, let's do it as a, let's, let's have, let's have them pick a number.
[8675.26 --> 8675.82]  How many total?
[8676.00 --> 8677.30]  Yeah, how many of these?
[8677.54 --> 8677.76]  Yep.
[8678.26 --> 8678.60]  Okay.
[8679.16 --> 8681.16]  This has been kind of fun for me to watch,
[8681.16 --> 8684.68]  but there has been a lot of feedback on our recent videos
[8684.68 --> 8690.44]  that people are really excited about the new direction and the new writing
[8690.44 --> 8693.54]  and the vibe of our most recent uploads
[8693.54 --> 8696.86]  and how happy they are about the production break
[8696.86 --> 8700.04]  and us taking the time to be more relaxed and,
[8700.08 --> 8702.90]  and do things properly and all of that good stuff.
[8703.36 --> 8707.78]  And I just want to say, um, let's play a game.
[8707.78 --> 8714.40]  I am going to show you guys all the videos that we have uploaded since the production break.
[8714.56 --> 8718.04]  And I want you guys to try and, we're going to have a poll on float plane, right?
[8718.22 --> 8719.96]  So how, how many are there total?
[8720.26 --> 8721.58]  There's nine total, I believe.
[8721.94 --> 8726.58]  I want you guys to answer from zero to nine.
[8726.84 --> 8731.02]  How many of those videos you think were produced before?
[8731.02 --> 8733.80]  No, let's go with after.
[8734.32 --> 8739.12]  How many of those videos do you think were actually produced after the production break
[8739.12 --> 8743.06]  versus videos that you think were produced before the production break,
[8743.14 --> 8746.08]  but we've just had sitting in the holster waiting to release them?
[8746.64 --> 8746.92]  Okay.
[8747.12 --> 8750.12]  So how many were produced after?
[8750.32 --> 8752.06]  That's what you guys are going to be guessing.
[8752.16 --> 8754.94]  So I'm just going to show you guys, I'll remind you guys of some of the videos here.
[8755.50 --> 8756.54]  Uh, here they are.
[8756.64 --> 8759.18]  So here's the announcement that we're coming back.
[8759.18 --> 8763.14]  This is a, uh, members only exclusive or float plane exclusive.
[8763.80 --> 8768.18]  So we've got the e-ink monitor that Adam and I checked out.
[8769.54 --> 8771.10]  Um, weird.
[8771.28 --> 8773.34]  That, that one doesn't show up in the screenshot on here.
[8773.60 --> 8775.64]  Oh, sorry.
[8775.74 --> 8776.18]  There's 10.
[8776.42 --> 8777.58]  The heck there's nine.
[8777.70 --> 8778.70]  There was on, on here.
[8778.76 --> 8779.30]  There's nine.
[8779.64 --> 8779.84]  Yeah.
[8779.88 --> 8780.40]  It's right there.
[8780.74 --> 8780.88]  Yeah.
[8780.88 --> 8781.48]  But there was one.
[8781.66 --> 8783.00]  That's cause that's not logged into memberships.
[8783.04 --> 8784.32]  So we're ignoring the members only.
[8784.46 --> 8784.82]  Okay.
[8784.90 --> 8786.24]  So yeah, I'm doing one through nine.
[8786.24 --> 8786.38]  Yeah.
[8786.44 --> 8792.52]  The next one is you'll loan nothing and be happy, which is, uh, kind of a, a discussion
[8792.52 --> 8794.52]  of hardware DLC.
[8794.94 --> 8799.06]  So it's an Intel CPU that you can unlock hyper threading and some extra cash.
[8799.52 --> 8802.02]  There's the all team you, which I've been informed.
[8802.14 --> 8805.50]  I pronounced wrong, but I don't care because they don't matter.
[8805.66 --> 8806.40]  They just don't shop there.
[8806.40 --> 8811.42]  The all 10, you all team you gaming setup, which was a really fun video, by the way.
[8812.68 --> 8814.00]  There's the Apple Newton.
[8814.22 --> 8819.32]  So we did a bit of a retrospective on Apple's Palm pilot competitor.
[8819.50 --> 8823.48]  I'm posting the poll now cause people are spamming freaking numbers and it's annoying.
[8823.68 --> 8828.04]  Uh, there's the AMD Radeon RX 7700 and 7800 XT review.
[8829.32 --> 8831.12]  There's, uh, there's another float plane exclusive.
[8831.28 --> 8831.84]  Oh, I love that.
[8831.84 --> 8835.16]  We put the float plane watermarked thumbnail on YouTube.
[8835.76 --> 8838.18]  There's the Soviet era gaming mouse.
[8838.46 --> 8839.44]  Uh, this one was really fun.
[8839.54 --> 8843.44]  We bought a mouse from like 1992 or something like that.
[8843.46 --> 8845.00]  We're not counting the float plane exclusives.
[8845.12 --> 8845.26]  Yeah.
[8845.26 --> 8846.24]  We're not counting those.
[8846.60 --> 8847.66]  Chad is a little confused tonight.
[8847.86 --> 8848.18]  That's okay.
[8848.30 --> 8848.46]  Yep.
[8848.78 --> 8850.52]  Uh, there's the Sonos upgrade.
[8851.38 --> 8857.68]  So Alex and I did a bunch of cable management and, uh, moved everything from a horrible mess on
[8857.68 --> 8859.52]  the floor to the wall.
[8860.42 --> 8861.80]  There's, oh, that one's exclusive.
[8861.84 --> 8866.32]  Uh, there's the Apple iPhone 15 announcement.
[8867.02 --> 8869.30]  There's 10 reasons I daily drive a foldable.
[8869.54 --> 8873.82]  So all the ones that I listed, that's the, that's the nine videos that are included.
[8873.82 --> 8876.76]  So I am very interested to see the poll.
[8876.86 --> 8883.50]  I also need to double check my initial, the initial results are mostly like everything
[8883.50 --> 8888.84]  five and beyond is like below 5% or at 5%.
[8888.84 --> 8893.80]  Uh, four has like roughly 12 or 13.
[8893.98 --> 8897.22]  Three has roughly just below 30.
[8897.54 --> 8899.40]  Two has just above 30.
[8899.40 --> 8902.90]  And one is floating around the 15, 16% mark.
[8903.08 --> 8904.54]  Obviously votes are still coming in.
[8904.74 --> 8905.72]  We'll see how that lands.
[8905.76 --> 8909.54]  But usually within the first like minute, things are pretty close to how they're going to end
[8909.54 --> 8909.70]  up.
[8910.74 --> 8912.16]  I have to be honest with you.
[8912.16 --> 8916.90]  I actually can't really tell the difference between them.
[8917.02 --> 8918.38]  And there's one that I need to check.
[8919.78 --> 8920.68]  That's kind of funny.
[8920.84 --> 8922.44]  Let me just check something really quick.
[8923.06 --> 8924.30]  I can't remember.
[8925.50 --> 8928.36]  Sometimes the days are just, uh, just a blur.
[8928.36 --> 8929.80]  Uh, no, I'm pretty sure.
[8929.90 --> 8930.34]  I'm pretty sure.
[8930.40 --> 8930.58]  Okay.
[8930.82 --> 8935.62]  The answer is, and here, let me pull up the, uh, the poll results.
[8935.74 --> 8938.28]  Uh, Ariel from the labs team.
[8938.58 --> 8938.76]  Ariel.
[8938.76 --> 8938.78]  Ariel.
[8938.80 --> 8939.14]  But yes.
[8939.22 --> 8939.56]  My bad.
[8939.78 --> 8941.26]  Uh, said, what are we counting?
[8941.38 --> 8942.26]  Written versus shot?
[8943.20 --> 8943.52]  Shot.
[8944.62 --> 8945.02]  Yeah.
[8945.44 --> 8945.84]  Yeah.
[8945.84 --> 8950.10]  There's a, I don't think there's anything that was actually written pre and then shot post,
[8950.34 --> 8952.28]  um, on this list anyway.
[8953.40 --> 8953.96]  All right.
[8954.04 --> 8956.92]  The answer is three.
[8957.50 --> 8957.92]  Okay.
[8959.00 --> 8962.56]  That had as of right now, which people are now going to know.
[8962.86 --> 8967.12]  So, but as of right now, that was tied for the second highest with 29%.
[8967.12 --> 8973.24]  So this one had a lot of really positive comments about how, you know, our tone was like totally
[8973.24 --> 8974.68]  different and totally new.
[8974.84 --> 8978.98]  Uh, this was shot and almost completely edited before the production break.
[8979.42 --> 8981.88]  Um, this one, people didn't really talk about too much.
[8981.94 --> 8987.20]  Uh, this one, I saw a lot of comments about how, you know, Linus seems like he's, he's pulling
[8987.20 --> 8989.46]  his punches or holding back or something.
[8989.62 --> 8991.74]  This was shot and edited before the break.
[8991.74 --> 8996.22]  Um, we made a couple of small changes cause we had a bunch of extra time, but it was largely
[8996.22 --> 8996.74]  produced.
[8996.74 --> 9001.46]  I saw some of the comments on that about how like, oh, he's really trying to be more like
[9001.46 --> 9003.06]  careful about things now.
[9003.18 --> 9004.82]  And it was, it was definitely before everything happened.
[9004.82 --> 9009.22]  Um, yeah, uh, the Apple Newton was actually shot the night before LTX.
[9009.28 --> 9011.78]  I saw a lot of people talk about how we didn't seem rushed.
[9012.18 --> 9018.84]  This was one of the most rushed shoots we've ever done, which is really cool.
[9019.30 --> 9020.94]  Um, this was an embargo product.
[9021.10 --> 9023.78]  So this one was, was done very recently.
[9024.36 --> 9026.26]  Um, the Soviet era gaming mouse.
[9026.34 --> 9032.08]  I saw so many comments about how this was, you know, obviously we were taking it to another
[9032.08 --> 9032.52]  level.
[9033.00 --> 9039.12]  Uh, this was, this was, uh, edited after, but written and shot before the production
[9039.12 --> 9039.52]  break.
[9039.56 --> 9042.84]  Uh, the Sonos one, uh, this one was actually shot recently.
[9043.30 --> 9046.78]  Uh, if I recall correctly, this is the one that I was not a hundred percent sure on, but
[9046.78 --> 9048.08]  I'm like 99% sure.
[9048.40 --> 9053.20]  Uh, the Apple announcement, this was done, uh, obviously the day that Apple released it.
[9053.20 --> 9057.16]  And then 10 reasons I daily drive a foldable was shot before the production break.
[9057.16 --> 9067.02]  Um, J 21, three, 21, two 34 says it shows how little we know and will ever know about
[9067.02 --> 9068.54]  the internal workings of LMG.
[9069.06 --> 9071.32]  Yes, it does.
[9072.60 --> 9080.68]  There is, I like to think I'm pretty transparent with you guys, but there's a lot that I cannot
[9080.68 --> 9081.08]  say.
[9081.08 --> 9086.00]  And there's a lot that it doesn't make sense for me to say if something got screwed up,
[9086.06 --> 9090.60]  for example, um, you know, in a way it's a catch 22 for me.
[9090.70 --> 9092.70]  If I say, yep, that's on me.
[9092.70 --> 9094.34]  Then I look incompetent.
[9094.54 --> 9100.22]  If I say that mistake was made by X, then I look like I'm putting down a member of my team.
[9101.10 --> 9103.66]  There's no way for me to win, but that's come.
[9103.74 --> 9105.06]  That comes with the position, right?
[9105.06 --> 9108.10]  Is that I know you're going to take some hits and you don't.
[9109.38 --> 9113.10]  And all I would ask is that, you know, that you don't know.
[9117.08 --> 9117.76]  All right.
[9118.44 --> 9122.16]  Let's talk about the framework gaming handheld because this is so cool.
[9122.16 --> 9123.18]  So cool.
[9123.94 --> 9124.90]  Oh my goodness.
[9124.90 --> 9125.94]  This is so cool.
[9127.14 --> 9130.14]  Incredibly well done considering the timeframe on this.
[9130.28 --> 9131.38]  I know, right?
[9131.64 --> 9132.58]  What the heck?
[9132.58 --> 9132.90]  Okay.
[9133.02 --> 9139.20]  So what I would like to do, because we don't want this to turn into, you know, a react situation
[9139.20 --> 9143.98]  where we are, where we are cannibalizing the original video.
[9144.22 --> 9144.34]  Yeah.
[9144.36 --> 9145.66]  You need to go watch the whole time.
[9145.66 --> 9145.94]  Hold on.
[9145.98 --> 9146.20]  Hold on.
[9146.26 --> 9146.64]  Oh, shoot.
[9146.72 --> 9146.94]  Oh yeah.
[9147.00 --> 9147.20]  Okay.
[9147.28 --> 9147.56]  No, no.
[9147.58 --> 9148.58]  This timestamp is fine.
[9148.72 --> 9149.52]  I have it started here.
[9149.58 --> 9150.00]  Do you want this?
[9150.10 --> 9150.48]  No, no.
[9150.50 --> 9150.74]  I'm good.
[9150.76 --> 9150.98]  I'm good.
[9151.08 --> 9153.70]  So I'm going to start by dumping links into the chat.
[9153.80 --> 9155.38]  I want you guys to all go there now.
[9155.72 --> 9155.98]  Yeah.
[9156.22 --> 9159.24]  And we can kind of watch it together or you know what?
[9159.30 --> 9160.58]  I'm not even going to watch it.
[9160.72 --> 9162.08]  I'm going to dump this in the chat.
[9162.08 --> 9163.28]  And we can just talk about it.
[9163.38 --> 9167.38]  And then we're going to talk about it, but I do want to at least show the people like
[9167.38 --> 9169.82]  a still or two from the video.
[9169.90 --> 9173.00]  So I'm going to, I'm going to scrub it a little bit, but it's two minutes long.
[9173.08 --> 9174.48]  You guys need to watch this.
[9174.66 --> 9175.64]  It's so cool.
[9175.74 --> 9178.74]  This is just a like tiny channel.
[9178.92 --> 9179.62]  Pit Stop Tech.
[9181.00 --> 9182.68]  163 subscribers.
[9182.68 --> 9184.12]  It was two when I looked.
[9184.20 --> 9184.58]  Not a hundred.
[9184.58 --> 9185.30]  People are jumping on.
[9185.30 --> 9185.76]  Not a hundred.
[9185.76 --> 9187.00]  Not a hundred sixty three thousand.
[9187.62 --> 9189.18]  One hundred sixty three.
[9189.62 --> 9189.90]  Okay.
[9190.44 --> 9192.22]  World's first fully modular handheld.
[9194.08 --> 9194.56]  Description.
[9194.78 --> 9198.06]  Description of the video says project I've been working on that I'm very passionate about.
[9198.44 --> 9204.56]  A fully upgradable gaming handheld where you can upgrade the battery, main board, CPU, RAM,
[9204.98 --> 9207.50]  storage by utilizing Frameworks modular components.
[9207.50 --> 9209.92]  I will be selling it soon as a DIY kit.
[9210.16 --> 9211.16]  I didn't know that.
[9211.26 --> 9211.88]  That's so cool.
[9212.18 --> 9216.58]  For those that want another way to reuse or buy new their framework components.
[9216.58 --> 9217.74]  That is so sick.
[9218.14 --> 9219.80]  I'm so happy that they're doing that.
[9219.96 --> 9221.68]  This is super cool.
[9221.82 --> 9222.36]  That's fantastic.
[9222.64 --> 9225.46]  Obviously, I have some concerns about weight.
[9225.94 --> 9226.90]  I think, what is it?
[9226.92 --> 9229.82]  A 60 or 70 watt hour battery or something like that?
[9230.52 --> 9230.92]  Yeah.
[9231.10 --> 9231.50]  Okay.
[9231.98 --> 9237.10]  So she's going to be a heavy boy and those bezels are decidedly last gen.
[9237.10 --> 9241.44]  Look, I don't want to pretend that this is a miracle device or anything like that.
[9241.50 --> 9246.80]  But for the use case that this person described in the description, if you are updating your
[9246.80 --> 9250.70]  laptop anyways and you can just now have a portable computer.
[9250.78 --> 9251.48]  Isn't this cool?
[9251.62 --> 9253.02]  That is so sick.
[9253.20 --> 9254.40]  It's such a cool project.
[9254.52 --> 9259.34]  The components they used were an Intel 12th gen main board with 16 gigs of RAM.
[9259.80 --> 9263.28]  They've got a 512 gig SSD in there, though it's a framework, so you could put whatever
[9263.28 --> 9264.00]  SSD you want.
[9264.00 --> 9264.06]  Yeah.
[9264.50 --> 9265.78]  55 watt hour battery.
[9265.88 --> 9266.16]  There you go.
[9266.20 --> 9267.20]  That answers that question.
[9267.66 --> 9269.66]  7 inch full HD touchscreen.
[9270.34 --> 9273.72]  Fully featured USB-C port because it's a framework main board.
[9274.10 --> 9275.50]  And then high speed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
[9277.40 --> 9285.22]  You know, when ASUS was here showing me the ROG Ally for the first time, I said, you know,
[9285.22 --> 9288.72]  guys, have you given much thought to repairability and upgradability?
[9289.22 --> 9292.66]  And, you know, obviously they were aware of what Valve's doing with the Steam Deck and
[9292.66 --> 9297.84]  they are sort of, not everyone at ASUS probably is, but, you know, some people there were aware
[9297.84 --> 9298.52]  of framework.
[9298.94 --> 9304.60]  And I was like, you guys in Ally 2 or Ally 3 get it in the pipeline.
[9304.60 --> 9311.50]  You guys must address this because, to my knowledge, framework isn't working on anything like this
[9311.50 --> 9311.76]  yet.
[9311.90 --> 9313.84]  I am an investor, but that doesn't mean I know everything.
[9314.02 --> 9316.40]  So for all I know, they could have a skunkworks project.
[9316.50 --> 9317.54]  That's a modular handle.
[9317.66 --> 9318.02]  I don't know.
[9318.52 --> 9321.02]  But to my knowledge, they're not working on anything like this yet.
[9321.02 --> 9325.14]  The best thing that you could do is make it so they don't have to.
[9325.52 --> 9327.22]  Be the one who does it.
[9328.22 --> 9337.20]  I don't know if they would have the forward thinking to do that, to get out ahead of it.
[9337.46 --> 9343.30]  But, man, I would like to see someone take this up, an upgradable handheld.
[9345.18 --> 9347.34]  Mastery asks, are you going to invest more?
[9347.94 --> 9348.42]  No.
[9349.38 --> 9350.30]  Probably not.
[9350.30 --> 9355.92]  I have other projects that I'm focused on right now, but I'm open to it.
[9356.14 --> 9359.06]  So the answer is probably not there.
[9359.12 --> 9359.86]  That's the real answer.
[9363.06 --> 9363.42]  Yeah.
[9363.62 --> 9364.98]  Absolutely sick looking project.
[9365.06 --> 9366.06]  Oh, you know what would be kind of cool?
[9366.36 --> 9367.56]  This is a really good idea.
[9369.16 --> 9372.04]  Someone said, hey, you should come have a look at how the view count.
[9372.12 --> 9372.24]  Yeah.
[9372.40 --> 9377.32]  Avon Fox says you should go check out how the view count is jumping.
[9377.32 --> 9380.80]  I've just been refreshing his channel and watching the subscriber count go up.
[9380.86 --> 9381.20]  It's fun.
[9381.70 --> 9382.50]  317 now.
[9382.58 --> 9383.10]  It's doubled.
[9383.44 --> 9384.06]  This is great.
[9384.80 --> 9385.44]  Nice job, man.
[9386.18 --> 9386.32]  Oh.
[9386.32 --> 9387.64]  You assume.
[9388.68 --> 9390.08]  Nice job, uh...
[9390.08 --> 9391.34]  Pit Stop Tech.
[9391.50 --> 9391.94]  There's no...
[9391.94 --> 9392.62]  Is that your phone?
[9392.78 --> 9393.22]  I don't know.
[9393.28 --> 9393.92]  It's under the table.
[9394.94 --> 9395.16]  Yeah.
[9395.76 --> 9395.98]  Yeah.
[9395.98 --> 9397.24]  I hucked mine over there.
[9398.00 --> 9398.30]  Uh-oh.
[9398.62 --> 9399.02]  Uh-oh.
[9399.22 --> 9399.62]  Uh-oh.
[9399.88 --> 9400.12]  Bad.
[9400.28 --> 9400.68]  Oh, sorry.
[9400.78 --> 9401.52]  I didn't mean to play that video.
[9401.52 --> 9403.88]  What is happening?
[9403.96 --> 9405.14]  I'm going to put it in this jacket.
[9405.72 --> 9408.04]  That is not a feature of that jacket.
[9408.14 --> 9409.22]  I'm going to put the jacket in a box.
[9409.36 --> 9413.80]  Luke, it's a bomber jacket, not an RFID blocking jacket.
[9414.58 --> 9415.94]  And then I'm going to throw a bomb.
[9417.22 --> 9417.74]  Okay.
[9418.30 --> 9418.92]  I mean, it stopped.
[9419.44 --> 9420.44]  The phone is away.
[9423.00 --> 9424.32]  You know what else is away?
[9425.28 --> 9427.12]  WhatsApp's proprietariness.
[9427.42 --> 9427.70]  Hey.
[9427.70 --> 9433.66]  Meta is preparing to add the capability to send and receive messages with other chat apps.
[9434.52 --> 9441.02]  Based on a new section for third-party chats spotted in the app's newest update in the Google Play beta program.
[9441.66 --> 9452.72]  This is likely due to the European Union's Digital Markets Act, which requires large companies that it defines as gatekeeper platforms to comply with additional restrictions and responsibilities.
[9452.72 --> 9459.90]  Other companies listed as gatekeeper platforms include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, and Microsoft.
[9460.54 --> 9473.70]  One requirement is that any company with a messaging app that has over 45 million active users, 10% of the EU population, must make that app interoperable with other messaging apps, which Meta will need to comply with.
[9473.70 --> 9477.10]  Can I just say a couple things here?
[9477.18 --> 9478.40]  First, shout out EU.
[9478.76 --> 9478.94]  Yeah.
[9479.06 --> 9479.54]  And second.
[9479.80 --> 9480.20]  Consistently.
[9480.36 --> 9487.18]  We need to have a longer conversation about the double-edged sword that is this kind of legislation.
[9487.52 --> 9488.14]  Anyway, hold on.
[9488.18 --> 9489.60]  Let's go on for a little bit here first.
[9490.08 --> 9498.58]  Part of the goal of the DMA is to institute a preemptive approach to monopolistic behavior rather than responding after the fact with prolonged antitrust investigations.
[9498.58 --> 9507.50]  The DMA also contains significant privacy protections and requires gatekeepers to get explicit consent from users in order to track their online behavior.
[9508.34 --> 9518.08]  Fines for failure to comply can include up to 10% of a company's revenue and 20% for repeat offenders.
[9518.08 --> 9529.22]  So our discussion question here is, should other countries around the world follow the EU's lead, or should we take a wait-and-see approach and just let capitalism do its thing?
[9529.88 --> 9533.68]  Before we talk about that, I want to talk about Apple switching to USB-C.
[9536.06 --> 9537.58]  Apple switch to USB-C.
[9537.80 --> 9540.02]  On the iPhone 15, it's at USB...
[9540.02 --> 9541.50]  I was kind of hoping that was going to be the whole topic.
[9541.50 --> 9541.66]  Yeah.
[9541.88 --> 9549.34]  It's USB 2.0 speeds, whereas on the iPhone 15 Pro, it does USB 3 at speeds of up to 10 gigabit per second.
[9549.50 --> 9560.92]  And I saw a lot of people upset about it, but we were about halfway through script review when I looked at Ploof, who was the writer for our video, and I was like,
[9561.78 --> 9564.44]  this is not them just hamstringing the 15.
[9565.30 --> 9568.64]  This is probably because the 15 uses the A16 Bionic.
[9568.64 --> 9572.28]  It probably legitimately doesn't have a USB 3 controller.
[9572.46 --> 9576.66]  And so we looked, and we were like, okay, well, what other devices have used the A16 Bionic?
[9576.72 --> 9583.00]  Because if an iPad did, for example, then if that iPad supported USB 3, well, then it was definitely on the silicon.
[9583.82 --> 9585.40]  But they never used it in an iPad.
[9585.88 --> 9588.50]  It was an iPhone-only SoC.
[9588.50 --> 9599.94]  So I think it's been confirmed at this point, but I was really glad that we didn't lay into Apple about it, because obviously, if it's not on the hardware, it's not going to be in there.
[9600.06 --> 9604.92]  So we will likely see an iPhone 16, if it's based on A17 silicon.
[9605.66 --> 9607.76]  Could they just align that numbering, please?
[9607.88 --> 9609.40]  Just skip one for one or something.
[9609.40 --> 9624.66]  Anyway, we would likely see an iPhone 16 with the A17 be equipped with USB 3 as sort of just a generational upgrade over the iPhone 15, which has a 16 silicon in it.
[9624.66 --> 9628.38]  So you get USB Type-C.
[9628.58 --> 9630.22]  I believe it's up to 20 watts of charging.
[9631.26 --> 9636.98]  You get USB 2 speeds on the iPhone 15, USB 3 speeds on the iPhone 15 Pro.
[9637.24 --> 9641.24]  And obviously the Pro Max or Ultra or whatever the heck they're calling everything these days.
[9641.80 --> 9645.22]  And I think that's pretty much everything to say about the Apple event.
[9645.32 --> 9646.92]  They also have a new watch or two.
[9647.38 --> 9652.52]  And yeah, you guys can watch the video summary that we did the other day.
[9652.52 --> 9660.68]  But this was also, even though Apple will not admit it as part of their innovation announcement launch event or whatever else,
[9660.74 --> 9673.80]  this is also due to pressure from the EU to standardize the cables and wall warts and all of the bits and pieces that we need for device charging
[9673.80 --> 9686.04]  that Apple has apparently decided to comply with rather than go full take my ball and go home and just moved everything wireless like has been speculated over the last few years.
[9686.04 --> 9698.60]  I have seen a lot of arguments, not all of which I can defeat both ways for this.
[9698.98 --> 9710.54]  On the one hand, the EU's action here towards platform interoperability and in the case of Apple, reducing waste.
[9710.54 --> 9716.32]  And okay, I'd like to stop everyone who is saying, well, what about all the lightning cables that are going to be wasted now?
[9717.22 --> 9720.28]  All of those lightning cables were going to be wasted.
[9720.80 --> 9721.26]  Yeah.
[9721.38 --> 9725.76]  The difference is now we aren't going to keep manufacturing any more of them.
[9726.84 --> 9727.86]  That's the point.
[9728.98 --> 9731.68]  Eventually, lightning was going to go away.
[9731.98 --> 9734.96]  Apple's been moving away from lightning for like six years.
[9734.96 --> 9741.80]  It's just a matter of how many more of these bloody things we keep making that will eventually be thrown away.
[9741.86 --> 9746.40]  In fact, every USB-C cable is probably going to be thrown away at some point.
[9746.84 --> 9755.66]  But at least by standardizing it, we can produce fewer of them so that we don't need to have more than one cable for our iPad and for our iPhone
[9755.66 --> 9764.40]  and then another one for our iPad and our iPhone in our, you know, carry, you know, a bag that we take to and from work, etc., etc.
[9765.16 --> 9766.98]  It's a reduction move.
[9766.98 --> 9777.14]  It's not that suddenly, you know, all those lightning cables are garbage and that's, you know, we've done a bad thing by switching over to USB-C.
[9777.26 --> 9780.58]  It's we will stop producing lightning cables at some point in the near future.
[9780.78 --> 9781.98]  And that is a good thing.
[9782.16 --> 9783.46]  That's the whole point of it.
[9783.46 --> 9795.78]  So with that said, I have seen arguments that, you know, the EU's move might not necessarily be if, even if it's a good move this time,
[9795.82 --> 9799.86]  it might set a really bad precedent because let's talk about lightning for a second.
[9799.94 --> 9805.20]  People like to dunk on it today, but lightning was huge when it came out.
[9805.36 --> 9806.24]  I actually really liked lightning.
[9806.24 --> 9815.98]  Major advantage iPhone when lightning was first introduced compared to USB micro B, which was a piece of crap.
[9815.98 --> 9819.90]  And you can quote the rated insertions all day.
[9820.02 --> 9820.88]  I don't care.
[9821.02 --> 9822.28]  I do not believe you.
[9822.40 --> 9832.32]  My anecdotal experience with USB micro B has been extensive enough and negative enough that you will never sell me that micro B was anything other than a failed standard.
[9832.32 --> 9834.28]  It was a bad connector.
[9835.26 --> 9838.58]  Fragile, finicky, terrible.
[9839.96 --> 9844.22]  Also, the space advantage over mini B?
[9845.60 --> 9846.08]  Negligible.
[9846.44 --> 9851.20]  If every phone had just used mini B until we got type C, I would have been way happier with that.
[9851.30 --> 9852.86]  And mini B was a piece of crap.
[9853.00 --> 9857.22]  I even have some weird hot takes about lightning as a non-Apple user.
[9857.42 --> 9859.02]  I actually just like the connector more.
[9859.02 --> 9859.66]  Yeah.
[9859.82 --> 9861.22]  I find it plugs in better.
[9861.38 --> 9862.82]  I'm not even talking compared to micro B.
[9863.40 --> 9864.28]  I'm talking compared to C.
[9864.44 --> 9864.70]  Sure.
[9865.04 --> 9867.06]  I find it plugs in significantly better.
[9867.40 --> 9867.62]  Yep.
[9867.76 --> 9869.32]  It has a really clear tactile.
[9869.78 --> 9870.10]  Yes.
[9870.22 --> 9871.92]  I am inserted right now feel.
[9872.78 --> 9875.14]  I think it's slightly smaller.
[9875.40 --> 9876.10]  Is that accurate?
[9877.88 --> 9878.70]  Than type C?
[9878.86 --> 9879.08]  Yeah.
[9879.18 --> 9879.38]  Yeah.
[9879.38 --> 9880.48]  It's marginally smaller.
[9880.52 --> 9880.54]  Yeah.
[9880.54 --> 9881.26]  So it's a little bit smaller.
[9881.26 --> 9883.94]  Remember, you've got to account for the housing on the other side and blah, blah, blah.
[9883.96 --> 9883.98]  Yeah.
[9883.98 --> 9884.92]  So it's hard to really know.
[9884.92 --> 9886.08]  It's marginally smaller.
[9886.08 --> 9889.96]  But I think it's slightly smaller and the plug-in feels like wildly better.
[9890.22 --> 9896.62]  I've always like kind of wished that the actual standard was the lightning cable.
[9897.00 --> 9901.50]  The problem is that lightning is too small to have enough conductors for modern functionality.
[9901.50 --> 9904.40]  I'm just talking from a like tactile side.
[9904.76 --> 9904.94]  Yeah.
[9904.94 --> 9912.62]  And that's a big part of why lightning has lost its luster because while it does have actually more conductors than USB 2, I forget what Apple uses them for.
[9912.72 --> 9916.36]  I think it's like auxiliary data transfer.
[9916.48 --> 9920.12]  Like that's how they're able to do HDMI over lightning and stuff like that.
[9920.18 --> 9928.68]  It is at significantly lower bandwidth than a real HDMI connection, but it does allow them to do additional things that you wouldn't be able to do with straight up USB 2.
[9928.68 --> 9931.32]  Yes, Chad, I know they're bums about the licensing.
[9931.66 --> 9936.52]  I'm also even looking right now at a USB-C to lightning adapter that is $40.
[9937.76 --> 9942.04]  I'm just talking about the tactile experience of using the cable.
[9942.18 --> 9943.38]  I actually very much like lightning.
[9943.52 --> 9944.02]  That's all I'm saying.
[9944.24 --> 9948.10]  Sue for AWS says too few conductors isn't a hard problem to solve.
[9948.68 --> 9949.78]  It sure is.
[9949.82 --> 9950.40]  Actually, yeah.
[9950.50 --> 9950.66]  What?
[9950.66 --> 9958.06]  It dramatically increases the complexity of the ICs at either end to have fewer conductors.
[9958.20 --> 9959.32]  Like they have to operate at it.
[9959.36 --> 9965.22]  You either have to increase the speed of the cars on the road or you have to increase the number of lanes.
[9965.96 --> 9976.40]  And so USB-C adds A, more speed, and B, a lot more lanes for data to travel along compared to a lightning connector.
[9976.40 --> 9987.02]  With that said, why?
[9989.08 --> 9991.44]  MysteryMe says USB 3.0 was possible over lightning.
[9991.54 --> 9994.94]  The iPad Pros that had lightning supported USB 3.0 speeds over lightning.
[9995.68 --> 9996.54]  Is that enough?
[9997.06 --> 9997.74]  Hold on a second.
[9997.88 --> 10002.26]  USB 3.0 was nine conductors when we got it.
[10002.30 --> 10003.16]  Lightning is only seven.
[10003.16 --> 10003.24]  Seven.
[10003.50 --> 10005.16]  So that would have been...
[10006.88 --> 10010.00]  Every one of my lightning cables has a burn pin.
[10010.10 --> 10010.74]  It says Reckoning.
[10010.94 --> 10011.12]  Okay.
[10011.16 --> 10014.48]  That's something I haven't personally experienced, although I haven't used it a fair bit.
[10014.92 --> 10020.98]  But we do have people talking in the chat about some design flaws in lightning.
[10021.10 --> 10022.06]  Oh, lightning is eight.
[10022.86 --> 10023.14]  Okay.
[10023.16 --> 10023.98]  I did not know that.
[10024.10 --> 10025.64]  I thought lightning was seven.
[10026.20 --> 10026.44]  Okay.
[10026.44 --> 10034.04]  Either way, either way, for whatever reason, whether it was cost on the device side, whether
[10034.04 --> 10040.34]  it was cost of the implementation on the client side, Apple did not broadly roll out higher
[10040.34 --> 10041.56]  data speeds over lightning.
[10042.12 --> 10048.76]  USB-C is clearly the path forward and is so much more capable, so much more standardized,
[10049.22 --> 10051.24]  and generally the right decision.
[10051.24 --> 10056.20]  Why don't we just leave it at that and then go into the next thing that I want to discuss,
[10056.34 --> 10065.24]  which is arguably they got it right this time, but given, in general, governing bodies...
[10067.24 --> 10069.74]  It has a potential to stifle innovation.
[10069.90 --> 10072.24]  Understanding of tech, generally.
[10073.20 --> 10078.24]  It also has a potential to cause things like USB Forum to fall into complacency.
[10078.36 --> 10080.50]  What are the odds they're going to get it right every time?
[10080.50 --> 10080.98]  Yeah.
[10081.44 --> 10084.70]  That's my bigger question, because yeah, those are totally valid concerns.
[10084.82 --> 10086.98]  Now are we stuck with USB-C forever?
[10088.62 --> 10090.62]  Forever's a long freaking time.
[10090.82 --> 10091.00]  Yeah.
[10091.68 --> 10093.30]  And you're right.
[10093.40 --> 10094.22]  Yeah, we can.
[10094.30 --> 10099.46]  We can make the cars drive faster, and we do have a lot more flexibility in the USB-C standard
[10099.46 --> 10100.76]  than we do in something like lightning.
[10100.86 --> 10102.00]  There's a lot more conductors.
[10102.70 --> 10106.50]  But is it going to be perfect forever?
[10106.68 --> 10109.58]  I mean, no, I can already see things about it that aren't perfect.
[10109.58 --> 10113.28]  Like you said, the tactile feel of the insertion is not as good.
[10113.72 --> 10118.62]  There's tiny, tiny little pins, tiny, tiny little contacts on both sides.
[10118.82 --> 10120.66]  It can be a little bit fragile.
[10120.76 --> 10121.82]  It can also be not fragile.
[10122.02 --> 10125.00]  We did that video ages ago, back when James started.
[10125.06 --> 10129.10]  One of his first jobs was to unplug and plug in an external drive,
[10129.20 --> 10130.80]  like literally thousands of times,
[10130.92 --> 10135.10]  until we managed to wear out every connector but the Type-C or something like that.
[10135.10 --> 10136.86]  I think we went to the rated number of insertions.
[10136.96 --> 10138.34]  It was literally thousands of times.
[10140.64 --> 10143.06]  Angle of insertion is not as wide, says Furingo.
[10143.14 --> 10143.80]  Yeah, exactly.
[10143.90 --> 10146.20]  There are definitely problems with Type-C.
[10147.22 --> 10148.96]  So are we stuck with it forever now?
[10149.10 --> 10154.84]  And should we be allowing these governing bodies to make these decisions?
[10154.84 --> 10157.14]  Was there ever a referendum on this?
[10157.96 --> 10159.50]  Is this actually democratic?
[10160.72 --> 10162.50]  I have no idea.
[10162.66 --> 10163.68]  I can't speak to that at all.
[10164.12 --> 10164.64]  I have no clue.
[10164.70 --> 10164.80]  No.
[10165.16 --> 10165.48]  Okay.
[10165.88 --> 10166.98]  Yeah, it's not democratic.
[10167.34 --> 10167.60]  Okay.
[10168.16 --> 10172.24]  So, man, I am torn, man.
[10173.54 --> 10175.68]  Yeah, what happens when lobbyists get involved
[10175.68 --> 10180.60]  and then they just, you know, pass down edicts that are advantageous to,
[10180.78 --> 10183.66]  I don't know, Microsoft over Apple.
[10183.76 --> 10184.76]  What recourse is there?
[10184.76 --> 10193.48]  I love the decisions that were made in this case
[10193.48 --> 10195.64]  because I'm going to be,
[10195.78 --> 10200.04]  my understanding is that this chat thing is going to apply to iMessage as well.
[10200.16 --> 10202.82]  So we could end up seeing RCS supported, at least in Europe.
[10202.82 --> 10206.26]  And if the Type-C connector is anything to go by,
[10206.42 --> 10207.84]  if they support it in Europe,
[10208.08 --> 10211.80]  to avoid peeving off their American and Asian customers,
[10212.24 --> 10214.04]  and Australian, I remember you guys in Africa.
[10214.04 --> 10216.02]  And also just not just like double-sq everything.
[10216.22 --> 10217.12]  All the continents, okay.
[10217.62 --> 10220.96]  In order to, yeah, in order to not peeve off the rest of their customers,
[10221.06 --> 10224.88]  I would hope that we would see RCS intercompatibility implemented everywhere else.
[10225.36 --> 10228.28]  In general, I really agree with the things that they're doing.
[10228.56 --> 10232.54]  I just worry that, you know, you can start out with good intentions
[10232.54 --> 10237.40]  and end up doing the wrong things really, really easily.
[10238.30 --> 10241.02]  I don't have a solution to this.
[10241.60 --> 10242.00]  No.
[10242.80 --> 10245.40]  But I'm really glad that iPhones are Type-C now.
[10246.96 --> 10247.36]  Yeah.
[10249.36 --> 10249.90]  All right.
[10250.00 --> 10251.40]  I mean, I guess, yeah, there's not really...
[10252.20 --> 10254.34]  Dan, do you have any thoughts on this?
[10254.40 --> 10256.64]  Are you just busy typing responses to people?
[10256.64 --> 10260.18]  I don't know, honestly.
[10260.36 --> 10263.40]  I do think it's interesting how, you know,
[10263.48 --> 10266.00]  one governing body by themselves
[10266.00 --> 10269.62]  for the protection of their own consumers and constituents
[10269.62 --> 10272.08]  makes one decision,
[10272.24 --> 10275.90]  and then all the companies are required to jump on it
[10275.90 --> 10281.14]  because it's cheaper to make one skew than two skews.
[10281.24 --> 10282.62]  That doesn't mean they're required to.
[10282.62 --> 10283.96]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[10284.00 --> 10286.10]  They're required by the hand of capitalism,
[10286.24 --> 10287.32]  if you want to think about it that way.
[10287.36 --> 10289.72]  Product development has gotten so expensive.
[10289.78 --> 10291.26]  No, no, I agree, but it's just...
[10291.26 --> 10291.82]  Sorry, thank you.
[10291.92 --> 10293.38]  Yeah, the clarification is important.
[10293.38 --> 10294.58]  It's fairly important there that it's not required.
[10294.78 --> 10294.96]  Sure.
[10296.94 --> 10297.20]  All right.
[10297.20 --> 10297.48]  All right.
[10297.74 --> 10300.10]  Yeah, because guiding hand of capitalism,
[10300.22 --> 10301.34]  I think, is a good way of saying it
[10301.34 --> 10303.26]  because, I mean, they could just pull out of the EU
[10303.26 --> 10305.82]  or they could have an EU-specific skew or something like that.
[10305.82 --> 10306.60]  Yeah, you've got two choices.
[10306.76 --> 10307.68]  You make two skews,
[10307.68 --> 10309.12]  you don't sell there,
[10309.24 --> 10311.40]  or you make one skew.
[10312.04 --> 10313.26]  I think that's three choices.
[10316.14 --> 10317.82]  In Type-C news,
[10318.66 --> 10320.72]  Intel announces Thunderbolt 5.
[10321.30 --> 10322.88]  The connector remains,
[10323.04 --> 10324.64]  so we have continuity
[10324.64 --> 10327.24]  all the way from Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 5,
[10327.42 --> 10329.74]  and this is looking pretty spicy.
[10329.74 --> 10333.96]  It is built on USB 4.0 V2.
[10334.44 --> 10336.36]  The cable is backwards compatible
[10336.36 --> 10338.10]  with previous versions of Thunderbolt.
[10338.34 --> 10342.60]  However, if you have a fully Thunderbolt 5 compliant ecosystem,
[10342.78 --> 10344.24]  you will be able to take advantage of
[10344.24 --> 10347.04]  up to 80 gigabit per second of bandwidth
[10347.04 --> 10350.26]  and up to 120 gigabit per second
[10350.26 --> 10352.00]  with bandwidth boosting,
[10352.20 --> 10355.42]  which I do not fully understand what they mean by that,
[10355.42 --> 10360.06]  but apparently allows more high-resolution monitors or something.
[10360.44 --> 10360.68]  Neat.
[10360.94 --> 10362.90]  Thunderbolt 5 can run a single monitor
[10362.90 --> 10364.30]  at up to 540 hertz,
[10364.58 --> 10367.54]  as many as three monitors running at 4K
[10367.54 --> 10369.22]  at 144 hertz each,
[10369.38 --> 10371.70]  or even multiple 8K displays.
[10372.08 --> 10372.68]  Jason Ziller,
[10372.82 --> 10374.50]  head of Intel's client connectivity division,
[10374.66 --> 10376.18]  speculated that Thunderbolt 5
[10376.18 --> 10379.14]  might lead to a resurgence in external graphics.
[10379.68 --> 10379.86]  Yeah.
[10381.04 --> 10383.62]  With basically RTX 30 series and up,
[10383.62 --> 10386.10]  you're giving up so much performance
[10386.10 --> 10388.36]  that the price becomes sort of impractical.
[10388.58 --> 10388.66]  Yeah.
[10388.76 --> 10389.94]  The thing about external graphics
[10389.94 --> 10392.14]  is that once you make an investment in an enclosure,
[10393.22 --> 10395.12]  you can hopefully, theoretically,
[10395.36 --> 10396.80]  carry it forward for a while.
[10396.96 --> 10399.34]  So if we can dramatically increase the bandwidth
[10399.34 --> 10400.26]  and you invest,
[10400.48 --> 10402.78]  invest, I'm using this term loosely, obviously,
[10403.12 --> 10404.84]  but you pony up
[10404.84 --> 10407.72]  for a Thunderbolt 5 compatible enclosure,
[10408.18 --> 10410.00]  theoretically, that's something you could start using
[10410.00 --> 10411.46]  with your Thunderbolt 4 device today,
[10411.56 --> 10412.40]  and then as you upgrade,
[10412.40 --> 10414.04]  you could continue to use,
[10414.18 --> 10416.36]  and so you could get multiple GPU upgrades out of it,
[10416.40 --> 10418.20]  making the cost a lot more palatable.
[10419.14 --> 10420.86]  I personally, you know,
[10421.64 --> 10423.44]  bias alert, bias alert,
[10423.68 --> 10425.04]  I love eGPU.
[10425.22 --> 10425.80]  I think it's just,
[10426.16 --> 10427.60]  I think it's hyper cool
[10427.60 --> 10429.80]  to be able to have a thin and light device
[10429.80 --> 10431.02]  I can carry around with me
[10431.02 --> 10433.58]  and then just dock
[10433.58 --> 10435.86]  and suddenly be on a gaming powerhouse.
[10435.86 --> 10437.48]  I just think it's the coolest stuff ever.
[10438.34 --> 10440.46]  Anyway, I would love,
[10440.50 --> 10443.46]  I would love for my bro Jason here to be right.
[10444.06 --> 10444.96]  We're Thunderbolt 4,
[10445.18 --> 10446.94]  supplied up to 100 watts of charging power.
[10447.06 --> 10450.48]  Thunderbolt 5 will do up to 240 watts,
[10450.70 --> 10452.38]  and that's all I have to say about that.
[10452.46 --> 10453.38]  I am excited.
[10453.74 --> 10455.42]  And then I have a surprise topic here
[10455.42 --> 10457.60]  called Twitter X monetization.
[10457.60 --> 10458.40]  We got paid.
[10459.16 --> 10461.04]  I know enough people have memed
[10461.04 --> 10462.68]  on Twitter monetization at this point.
[10462.74 --> 10464.82]  I was actually like waiting for us to do this.
[10465.54 --> 10466.86]  To talk about monetization?
[10467.18 --> 10468.72]  No, I didn't realize
[10468.72 --> 10470.94]  you guys had turned that on.
[10471.08 --> 10471.30]  Yeah.
[10471.78 --> 10472.68]  And I was like,
[10472.94 --> 10473.74]  why don't we do this?
[10474.04 --> 10475.60]  Because our total payout,
[10475.74 --> 10476.86]  which I believe is for a month,
[10476.92 --> 10478.40]  was $76.30.
[10478.84 --> 10480.36]  Wow, that's really low
[10480.36 --> 10482.16]  compared to other ones that I've seen.
[10482.96 --> 10483.76]  I wonder why.
[10484.96 --> 10486.04]  CPMs, stuff like that.
[10486.26 --> 10488.08]  Yeah, also just, you know what?
[10488.08 --> 10489.52]  I don't know, likes on Twitter
[10489.52 --> 10490.28]  or like whatever.
[10490.58 --> 10491.38]  I don't know how it works.
[10491.54 --> 10492.02]  I don't really care.
[10492.40 --> 10493.86]  I just, I was looking at it being like,
[10493.94 --> 10495.32]  hey, there's free money.
[10495.46 --> 10496.72]  Yeah, I'll take my $76.
[10497.16 --> 10498.10]  Might as well have the free money.
[10498.22 --> 10498.38]  Yeah.
[10498.74 --> 10498.98]  Yeah.
[10500.54 --> 10500.90]  Awesome.
[10501.24 --> 10501.56]  Cool.
[10502.58 --> 10502.92]  Sweet.
[10503.08 --> 10503.52]  Sounds good.
[10503.70 --> 10504.18]  Next topic.
[10504.68 --> 10506.22]  Yeah, I think we've got one more
[10506.22 --> 10507.18]  and then it's time to,
[10507.30 --> 10508.10]  yeah, the Surface Duo
[10508.10 --> 10509.54]  has reached its end.
[10510.58 --> 10513.22]  Microsoft's dual screen Android device.
[10514.16 --> 10515.78]  Microsoft's original Surface Duo
[10515.78 --> 10516.96]  foldable phone reached
[10516.96 --> 10519.14]  the end of its three-year update life
[10519.14 --> 10520.40]  as of September 10th.
[10520.50 --> 10522.42]  However, the $1,400 device
[10522.42 --> 10524.70]  never ran an up-to-date version of Android,
[10525.10 --> 10526.02]  having only received
[10526.02 --> 10528.28]  two extremely late OS updates
[10528.28 --> 10529.16]  during its lifespan.
[10530.40 --> 10531.72]  It got shipped with Android 10,
[10531.98 --> 10533.06]  a year-old OS,
[10533.18 --> 10534.92]  after Android 11 had already launched
[10534.92 --> 10536.58]  and got its update to Android 11
[10536.58 --> 10538.98]  16 months later,
[10539.60 --> 10542.34]  after Android 12L had already launched.
[10544.04 --> 10547.86]  It received 12L only after Android 13 launched,
[10548.10 --> 10550.84]  giving it a worst-in-class update schedule.
[10551.76 --> 10552.56]  That's a yikes.
[10553.12 --> 10555.48]  The Surface Duo was praised for its design,
[10555.58 --> 10557.44]  but criticized for its software quality,
[10557.86 --> 10559.36]  underpowered hardware,
[10559.36 --> 10560.94]  and extreme bugginess.
[10561.32 --> 10562.96]  Android wasn't able to fully use
[10562.96 --> 10564.56]  its UltraWide 4x3 displays,
[10564.76 --> 10566.96]  and there was no split keyboard, really.
[10567.82 --> 10570.02]  Making typing difficult.
[10570.22 --> 10572.10]  Microsoft dropped the price of the Surface Duo
[10572.10 --> 10574.58]  by $200 a month after launch,
[10574.58 --> 10578.90]  and eventually dropped it to $409 to $1,000 less
[10578.90 --> 10580.10]  than the original MSRP.
[10580.10 --> 10581.10]  $409.
[10582.18 --> 10583.18]  That is $1,000.
[10583.18 --> 10583.72]  Oh, I see.
[10583.92 --> 10585.60]  Yeah, that's $1,000 less
[10585.60 --> 10586.68]  than the original MSRP.
[10586.92 --> 10587.22]  Wow.
[10587.70 --> 10588.98]  The device was originally intended
[10588.98 --> 10590.72]  to run a version of Windows,
[10590.90 --> 10592.24]  and the Android OS development
[10592.24 --> 10593.42]  was outsourced
[10593.42 --> 10595.96]  until Microsoft brought out
[10595.96 --> 10597.10]  the outsourcing company.
[10597.14 --> 10597.50]  Bought out.
[10597.76 --> 10599.54]  Bought out the outsourcing company
[10599.54 --> 10601.12]  two months prior to launch.
[10601.44 --> 10601.70]  Okay.
[10602.00 --> 10602.56]  Wow.
[10602.86 --> 10603.98]  What a disaster.
[10604.50 --> 10606.02]  Who could have ever seen it coming?
[10607.00 --> 10609.08]  Everyone that's seen Microsoft make
[10609.08 --> 10611.14]  portable devices?
[10611.46 --> 10613.58]  My discussion question here,
[10613.60 --> 10615.06]  I'm just going to come up with my own one.
[10615.10 --> 10615.62]  Sorry, Jessica.
[10616.16 --> 10617.50]  My discussion question here is...
[10617.50 --> 10617.52]  That's not fair.
[10617.52 --> 10618.52]  Portable devices isn't fair.
[10618.68 --> 10619.76]  I was trying to reference the Zune.
[10620.00 --> 10620.18]  Sorry.
[10620.30 --> 10620.50]  Yeah.
[10620.60 --> 10620.90]  Keep going.
[10621.90 --> 10622.38]  Is...
[10624.52 --> 10626.74]  Does this kind of thing just kill innovation?
[10627.00 --> 10628.14]  I should really like the Zune.
[10628.76 --> 10629.70]  Uh, kind of.
[10629.70 --> 10630.02]  Zune HD.
[10630.26 --> 10630.72]  I think so.
[10630.82 --> 10632.38]  Because we've talked on the show before
[10632.38 --> 10634.02]  about how your best bet,
[10634.14 --> 10635.50]  if you want proper support,
[10635.62 --> 10636.94]  is to just buy the popular one.
[10636.94 --> 10640.44]  Because we've seen time and time again
[10640.44 --> 10642.78]  that companies can afford to peeve off
[10642.78 --> 10644.74]  a handful of super fans,
[10644.84 --> 10646.26]  no matter how super they are,
[10646.30 --> 10648.16]  and no matter how fanatical they are.
[10648.40 --> 10650.42]  But they can't afford to peeve off
[10650.42 --> 10651.94]  the bulk of their user base.
[10652.40 --> 10654.78]  So if you always just go,
[10655.42 --> 10656.64]  you know, whatever the,
[10656.68 --> 10658.30]  you know, chipset name,
[10658.86 --> 10661.76]  Strix E, you know, from Asus,
[10661.76 --> 10663.86]  or, you know, whatever the,
[10663.94 --> 10666.14]  whatever the best-selling iPhone,
[10666.40 --> 10667.66]  you know, don't get the Mini.
[10667.84 --> 10668.98]  You know nobody buys the Mini,
[10669.12 --> 10669.84]  so don't get the Mini.
[10669.94 --> 10671.28]  Just get whatever the mainstream one
[10671.28 --> 10672.42]  that everyone is buying is.
[10672.98 --> 10676.52]  You are very likely to get the longest tail
[10676.52 --> 10677.78]  on your software support
[10677.78 --> 10679.96]  and have a better overall experience,
[10680.08 --> 10681.64]  even if that other product,
[10681.76 --> 10683.90]  advertised features that you personally think
[10683.90 --> 10685.86]  would be very beneficial to you.
[10685.86 --> 10687.76]  I will say the better off
[10687.76 --> 10690.10]  in this conversation is a little bit fluid.
[10690.10 --> 10691.70]  In terms of software support.
[10691.86 --> 10691.98]  Yeah.
[10692.20 --> 10694.80]  In terms of them caring about
[10694.80 --> 10696.50]  the experience of their customers
[10696.50 --> 10698.52]  because there is strength in numbers.
[10698.68 --> 10698.86]  Yeah.
[10699.08 --> 10700.12]  And so I worry...
[10700.12 --> 10701.12]  You might enjoy something
[10701.12 --> 10702.64]  that doesn't have as much software support.
[10702.72 --> 10704.30]  It might be a better purchasing decision for you,
[10704.38 --> 10705.32]  but, yeah.
[10705.54 --> 10708.12]  I worry that with devices like this, though,
[10708.44 --> 10710.82]  where there's an expectation of ongoing support,
[10710.94 --> 10713.16]  which is, I mean, basically anything we buy now,
[10713.20 --> 10714.82]  it's all connected, it's all smart.
[10715.44 --> 10717.52]  I worry that companies are going to look
[10717.52 --> 10718.78]  at a new product category and go,
[10718.78 --> 10720.10]  holy s***,
[10720.18 --> 10722.84]  if we don't want to look like complete bad guys here,
[10723.22 --> 10724.44]  we are going to have to employ
[10724.44 --> 10725.94]  a full-time software team
[10725.94 --> 10727.68]  to sit and build updates for this thing,
[10727.74 --> 10729.20]  whether we sell a million
[10729.20 --> 10731.06]  or whether we sell ten of these.
[10732.22 --> 10733.08]  If you know what?
[10733.80 --> 10734.52]  Forget it.
[10737.66 --> 10738.06]  Yeah.
[10739.60 --> 10740.42]  Yeah, it's an issue.
[10740.74 --> 10741.76]  Time for Wancho After Dark.
[10742.16 --> 10742.64]  I think so.
[10744.96 --> 10745.54]  He's going.
[10745.74 --> 10746.56]  Don't worry, he's got this.
[10746.56 --> 10748.96]  Why don't we pick a couple while we wait for Dan?
[10749.56 --> 10749.80]  What?
[10752.72 --> 10753.28]  Potential.
[10755.52 --> 10756.92]  Oh, interesting.
[10758.02 --> 10758.82]  Christian asks,
[10758.94 --> 10759.60]  love the content.
[10759.80 --> 10760.04]  Luke,
[10760.46 --> 10761.76]  how hard was it to set up
[10761.76 --> 10764.26]  the desk pad configurator on LTT Store?
[10765.30 --> 10767.36]  Oh, that was a Conrad task,
[10767.42 --> 10769.06]  and I think he's probably watching,
[10769.20 --> 10769.94]  so he could say,
[10770.42 --> 10773.12]  but I don't think it was too bad of a task.
[10773.52 --> 10774.68]  Spoken like a true boss.
[10774.68 --> 10776.04]  It was, what?
[10777.32 --> 10778.94]  I don't think it was too hard.
[10779.58 --> 10781.44]  No, like, I think it was honestly
[10781.44 --> 10782.86]  mostly a passion project.
[10783.58 --> 10785.48]  I think Conrad had a lot of fun making it.
[10785.60 --> 10786.46]  It's a cool tool.
[10787.22 --> 10788.30]  It's not necessarily something
[10788.30 --> 10789.02]  that you would, like,
[10789.20 --> 10790.96]  expect to see on a store,
[10791.08 --> 10792.38]  so it's fun that we have it.
[10794.62 --> 10797.20]  I don't see people talk about it, like, a ton.
[10797.38 --> 10798.80]  I wish more people used it,
[10798.96 --> 10800.78]  but I think because it's not something
[10800.78 --> 10802.44]  that people expect to be there,
[10802.44 --> 10805.02]  they don't click on it all that much.
[10805.08 --> 10806.58]  Yeah, see, Conrad's saying it took two weeks.
[10806.90 --> 10807.72]  Like, this wasn't, like,
[10807.76 --> 10810.16]  a super huge commit or anything,
[10810.76 --> 10812.74]  but it's one of the cooler things
[10812.74 --> 10814.20]  on the store, in my opinion.
[10815.32 --> 10816.32]  I think it's awesome.
[10816.46 --> 10817.26]  You can add monitors.
[10817.26 --> 10818.64]  So you could, like,
[10818.68 --> 10819.90]  if you measured your desk,
[10820.40 --> 10821.78]  you could put the height and width
[10821.78 --> 10822.44]  of your desk
[10822.44 --> 10825.22]  into the configurator
[10825.22 --> 10826.50]  and genuinely see
[10826.50 --> 10829.14]  how this mouse pad
[10829.14 --> 10830.34]  is going to look on your desk,
[10830.34 --> 10831.40]  and you could even put on
[10831.40 --> 10832.16]  a keyboard and mouse
[10832.16 --> 10833.16]  and your monitors and everything
[10833.16 --> 10833.76]  to kind of, like,
[10833.80 --> 10835.04]  see how it would all lay out,
[10835.14 --> 10836.32]  and I think that's awesome.
[10836.66 --> 10837.76]  I think that's super cool.
[10839.54 --> 10840.62]  Yeah, so in a full plane chat,
[10840.70 --> 10841.84]  I've used it pretty useful.
[10842.14 --> 10843.12]  I think it's sweet.
[10843.20 --> 10844.52]  If I was buying a mouse pad,
[10844.52 --> 10846.04]  I would 100% use that,
[10846.42 --> 10847.26]  and that's one of the reasons
[10847.26 --> 10847.96]  why I was, like,
[10848.02 --> 10849.14]  stoked about him making it
[10849.14 --> 10850.02]  is because I was like,
[10850.48 --> 10852.32]  dude, this would massively improve
[10852.32 --> 10853.62]  my shopping experience
[10853.62 --> 10854.62]  if I was buying one of these.
[10855.16 --> 10856.62]  So, like, sweet.
[10857.58 --> 10858.32]  Yeah, super cool.
[10858.72 --> 10858.96]  Yeah.
[10860.10 --> 10860.84]  Shall we get into it?
[10861.12 --> 10861.76]  Yeah, hit me.
[10861.96 --> 10862.38]  All right.
[10862.96 --> 10863.44]  Hey, guys,
[10863.52 --> 10864.32]  what's your take
[10864.32 --> 10865.58]  on the potential requirement
[10865.58 --> 10867.62]  for user-replaceable phone batteries?
[10868.00 --> 10868.40]  Do you believe
[10868.40 --> 10869.94]  they're intentionally hard to replace,
[10869.98 --> 10871.02]  or is it due to the nature
[10871.02 --> 10872.18]  of modern design?
[10872.30 --> 10873.50]  I think it's a little bit of column A
[10873.50 --> 10874.48]  and a little bit of column B.
[10874.90 --> 10876.40]  I think that there is a demand
[10876.40 --> 10877.72]  for thinner devices,
[10877.92 --> 10879.32]  but I also think that
[10879.32 --> 10881.26]  companies tend to get
[10881.26 --> 10882.20]  kind of tunnel vision
[10882.20 --> 10883.98]  on what consumers want
[10883.98 --> 10885.84]  and make compromises
[10885.84 --> 10887.08]  that are stupid
[10887.08 --> 10887.94]  and that consumers
[10887.94 --> 10889.44]  wouldn't have actually asked for
[10889.44 --> 10892.28]  in pursuit of a perceived goal,
[10892.42 --> 10893.12]  and then it becomes
[10893.12 --> 10894.20]  a self-fulfilling prophecy
[10894.20 --> 10895.22]  because when everyone
[10895.22 --> 10896.42]  just starts making it one way,
[10896.80 --> 10897.56]  all the sales
[10897.56 --> 10898.52]  are suddenly devices
[10898.52 --> 10899.54]  that are made that way.
[10899.96 --> 10900.92]  So you can end up
[10900.92 --> 10902.24]  with this industry momentum
[10902.24 --> 10903.08]  that we've seen
[10903.08 --> 10904.70]  play out multiple times
[10904.70 --> 10905.92]  in the mobile phone industry.
[10905.92 --> 10906.88]  Remember when phones
[10906.88 --> 10907.88]  only got smaller?
[10908.14 --> 10909.10]  And then remember
[10909.10 --> 10910.44]  when they only got bigger?
[10910.68 --> 10911.78]  And then remember
[10911.78 --> 10913.74]  when they only got thinner?
[10913.94 --> 10914.80]  And now we don't have
[10914.80 --> 10915.58]  replaceable batteries.
[10915.58 --> 10916.86]  It's like survivorship bias.
[10916.86 --> 10917.52]  Yes.
[10917.68 --> 10917.92]  Yeah.
[10918.32 --> 10918.80]  Exactly.
[10919.86 --> 10922.56]  I find survivorship bias
[10922.56 --> 10923.54]  to be fascinating.
[10923.66 --> 10924.48]  And one of the things
[10924.48 --> 10925.56]  that I talk about a lot
[10925.56 --> 10926.00]  on the show
[10926.00 --> 10927.02]  is that anytime Apple
[10927.02 --> 10927.76]  does something
[10927.76 --> 10930.54]  that's really stupid
[10930.54 --> 10931.40]  or really negative,
[10931.56 --> 10932.78]  I get enraged
[10932.78 --> 10934.46]  because I know
[10934.46 --> 10936.34]  that now all of a sudden
[10936.34 --> 10937.60]  everyone's going to look at
[10937.60 --> 10938.20]  whatever it is
[10938.20 --> 10938.78]  that Apple's doing
[10938.78 --> 10939.10]  and go,
[10939.10 --> 10940.00]  oh, well the iPhone
[10940.00 --> 10940.98]  sells however many
[10940.98 --> 10943.28]  umpteen millions of units
[10943.28 --> 10944.98]  therefore that decision
[10944.98 --> 10945.58]  was right.
[10945.70 --> 10946.82]  But that's not necessarily
[10946.82 --> 10947.34]  the case.
[10947.42 --> 10948.38]  People could be buying iPhones
[10948.38 --> 10949.44]  for any number
[10949.44 --> 10950.52]  of other reasons.
[10950.84 --> 10952.04]  Here's another annoying point
[10952.04 --> 10952.96]  that I'm going to bring up.
[10955.34 --> 10956.48]  Some people
[10956.48 --> 10958.66]  will prefer the bad
[10958.66 --> 10960.30]  if it's what they're used to.
[10960.84 --> 10961.14]  Yeah.
[10962.04 --> 10963.24]  Not even some people.
[10963.38 --> 10964.72]  A huge portion of people.
[10964.72 --> 10965.46]  Well that's just
[10965.46 --> 10966.14]  that other bias.
[10966.26 --> 10967.52]  That's just familiarity bias.
[10967.70 --> 10967.82]  Yeah.
[10967.82 --> 10969.68]  Is that what that one's called?
[10969.76 --> 10970.16]  I don't know
[10970.16 --> 10970.82]  but it sounds right.
[10972.22 --> 10972.90]  But that's like
[10972.90 --> 10974.08]  totally a thing.
[10974.30 --> 10974.86]  You can make something
[10974.86 --> 10975.64]  that's way better
[10975.64 --> 10976.52]  but people will be like
[10976.52 --> 10977.58]  this feels unfamiliar.
[10977.86 --> 10978.46]  Okay, it's not quite
[10978.46 --> 10979.20]  familiarity bias.
[10979.32 --> 10980.24]  That's a cognitive bias
[10980.24 --> 10981.18]  in which people tend to rely
[10981.18 --> 10981.70]  on information
[10981.70 --> 10982.64]  that is already familiar
[10982.64 --> 10983.78]  to them when making decisions.
[10983.88 --> 10984.96]  So that's not familiarity bias.
[10985.06 --> 10985.82]  It's got to be something else.
[10986.36 --> 10987.88]  I'm sure there's a kind of bias
[10987.88 --> 10988.60]  that that is.
[10988.86 --> 10990.58]  It sounds closely related
[10990.58 --> 10991.58]  but not necessarily 100%.
[10991.58 --> 10992.76]  Yeah, that's not quite right.
[10994.54 --> 10994.94]  More?
[10995.54 --> 10995.82]  Yeah.
[10995.94 --> 10996.14]  More.
[10996.64 --> 10997.70]  Two, Linus and Luke.
[10997.82 --> 10998.88]  Just wanted to confess.
[10998.88 --> 11000.44]  I have ripped copies
[11000.44 --> 11001.50]  of your content.
[11002.12 --> 11003.36]  Only half joking
[11003.36 --> 11005.06]  but have you guys considered
[11005.06 --> 11006.10]  physical copies
[11006.10 --> 11006.76]  of your content
[11006.76 --> 11007.84]  for markets like Cuba
[11007.84 --> 11008.92]  that have zero access
[11008.92 --> 11009.60]  to internet?
[11010.40 --> 11010.84]  No.
[11011.24 --> 11012.08]  I don't...
[11012.08 --> 11013.38]  What am I going to like...
[11013.38 --> 11014.34]  Why am I trying
[11014.34 --> 11015.20]  to monetize this?
[11015.24 --> 11016.00]  I just assume
[11016.00 --> 11016.66]  that if people want
[11016.66 --> 11017.34]  to watch our content
[11017.34 --> 11017.78]  in Cuba
[11017.78 --> 11018.84]  they're just downloading it
[11018.84 --> 11019.90]  and then sending it over there
[11019.90 --> 11020.46]  on Sneakernet.
[11020.72 --> 11020.88]  Yeah.
[11021.60 --> 11022.28]  Which is awesome.
[11022.68 --> 11023.12]  Do it up.
[11024.10 --> 11024.80]  Yeah, if you otherwise
[11024.80 --> 11026.02]  don't have access to it
[11026.02 --> 11026.66]  I'd rather people
[11026.66 --> 11027.24]  are watching
[11027.24 --> 11028.38]  and I'm not making money
[11028.38 --> 11029.42]  than that they're not watching.
[11029.84 --> 11030.38]  Like, obviously.
[11030.62 --> 11031.78]  If you're watching that way
[11031.78 --> 11033.54]  what's up?
[11033.58 --> 11033.70]  Yeah.
[11033.72 --> 11034.76]  I've always found...
[11034.76 --> 11034.94]  How you doing?
[11035.08 --> 11035.92]  I've always found that
[11035.92 --> 11037.02]  to be fascinating.
[11037.14 --> 11037.30]  Yeah.
[11037.30 --> 11038.28]  It's super, super cool.
[11038.28 --> 11039.88]  I watched a little mini doc
[11039.88 --> 11040.84]  on it years ago
[11040.84 --> 11043.30]  and it's just really cool
[11043.30 --> 11044.74]  and I think the people
[11044.74 --> 11046.28]  that run that...
[11046.28 --> 11047.48]  That's sweet.
[11047.72 --> 11048.80]  Oh God, people are talking
[11048.80 --> 11049.60]  about physical copies
[11049.60 --> 11050.22]  of the Christmas album.
[11050.32 --> 11050.54]  No!
[11051.14 --> 11052.54]  Only two of those exist.
[11053.06 --> 11054.40]  Limited edition pressing.
[11059.04 --> 11059.90]  Hey DLL.
[11060.18 --> 11062.42]  I've worked in K-12 education
[11062.42 --> 11063.48]  for several years
[11063.48 --> 11064.70]  and wonder what you guys
[11064.70 --> 11065.80]  think about young kids
[11065.80 --> 11066.98]  using devices so much
[11066.98 --> 11068.00]  during the school day.
[11068.32 --> 11069.10]  Is this a positive
[11069.10 --> 11070.46]  or negative development?
[11071.56 --> 11072.46]  Honestly, I think
[11072.46 --> 11073.46]  it's one of those things
[11073.46 --> 11074.74]  that we have absolutely
[11074.74 --> 11075.68]  no way of knowing
[11075.68 --> 11076.60]  until these kids
[11076.60 --> 11077.92]  have all grown up
[11077.92 --> 11079.24]  and moved into the world
[11079.24 --> 11080.18]  and can make a decision
[11080.18 --> 11080.72]  for themselves.
[11081.40 --> 11082.78]  Why are we trying to decide
[11082.78 --> 11083.62]  if this was a positive
[11083.62 --> 11084.50]  or negative development
[11084.50 --> 11084.94]  for them
[11084.94 --> 11085.76]  when ultimately
[11085.76 --> 11086.56]  they're going to look
[11086.56 --> 11087.26]  around at themselves
[11087.26 --> 11088.00]  and at their peers
[11088.00 --> 11089.22]  and go,
[11089.36 --> 11089.76]  okay, you know,
[11089.82 --> 11090.62]  I regretted this
[11090.62 --> 11091.56]  and I wish we'd done it
[11091.56 --> 11092.18]  this way differently
[11092.18 --> 11092.86]  and then hopefully
[11092.86 --> 11093.98]  they apply those learnings
[11093.98 --> 11094.80]  to the next generation
[11094.80 --> 11096.12]  and we continue to improve.
[11096.22 --> 11097.18]  I don't know why
[11097.18 --> 11098.04]  I'm even saying all this
[11098.04 --> 11098.78]  because I have absolutely
[11098.78 --> 11099.68]  no faith that that's
[11099.68 --> 11100.34]  how it'll play out
[11100.34 --> 11100.82]  but hey,
[11101.32 --> 11102.40]  you can't blame me
[11102.40 --> 11103.14]  for being optimistic.
[11103.48 --> 11104.90]  There was a video
[11104.90 --> 11105.64]  someone sent me
[11105.64 --> 11106.78]  that was posted on Reddit
[11106.78 --> 11108.30]  that was of some talk show
[11108.30 --> 11109.22]  or something somewhere
[11109.22 --> 11110.06]  and there was a teacher
[11110.06 --> 11110.84]  on the talk show
[11110.84 --> 11112.54]  and they were asking
[11112.54 --> 11113.16]  the teacher
[11113.16 --> 11116.80]  about plagiarism detectors
[11116.80 --> 11118.74]  for stuff like ChatGPT
[11118.74 --> 11120.72]  and her take on it
[11120.72 --> 11121.92]  was like amazing.
[11122.26 --> 11123.40]  It was like perfect
[11123.40 --> 11124.10]  in my opinion
[11124.10 --> 11125.16]  which is basically
[11125.16 --> 11126.34]  using stuff like
[11126.34 --> 11127.24]  plagiarism detectors
[11127.24 --> 11131.00]  is an extremely short-sighted
[11131.00 --> 11132.52]  and also bad
[11132.52 --> 11135.74]  way to like solve this problem
[11135.74 --> 11137.24]  because people are going
[11137.24 --> 11137.90]  to do it anyways
[11137.90 --> 11139.94]  and your plagiarism detector
[11139.94 --> 11140.62]  is not going to be
[11140.62 --> 11141.50]  100% successful.
[11141.90 --> 11142.46]  You're going to catch
[11142.46 --> 11143.32]  the people that,
[11143.42 --> 11143.90]  you know,
[11143.98 --> 11144.28]  leave,
[11144.38 --> 11145.56]  I am a large language model
[11145.56 --> 11146.62]  in the middle of their essay
[11146.62 --> 11147.82]  which if you just read it yourself
[11147.82 --> 11148.76]  you could catch anyways.
[11148.94 --> 11149.04]  Yeah.
[11150.80 --> 11153.16]  And what she thinks
[11153.16 --> 11154.36]  classes should do
[11154.36 --> 11156.36]  is like get them
[11156.36 --> 11157.42]  to go home
[11157.42 --> 11159.60]  and prompt engineer
[11159.60 --> 11160.26]  up an essay
[11160.26 --> 11161.86]  and then get them
[11161.86 --> 11163.06]  to bring it into class
[11163.06 --> 11164.16]  and then pull like
[11164.16 --> 11165.20]  a bait and switch on them
[11165.20 --> 11165.76]  and be like,
[11165.86 --> 11166.00]  okay,
[11166.02 --> 11166.90]  now you need to debate
[11166.90 --> 11167.80]  against that essay
[11167.80 --> 11170.22]  or you need to like
[11170.22 --> 11171.34]  grade it
[11171.34 --> 11173.78]  and hand in to me
[11173.78 --> 11174.30]  what you think
[11174.30 --> 11175.08]  should be changed
[11175.08 --> 11175.82]  or something like that.
[11175.92 --> 11177.32]  Like get them to work
[11177.32 --> 11178.44]  on improving it,
[11178.52 --> 11179.16]  get them to work
[11179.16 --> 11180.48]  on workshopping it
[11180.48 --> 11181.10]  in different ways,
[11181.18 --> 11181.72]  all this type of stuff
[11181.72 --> 11183.30]  and I just heard that
[11183.30 --> 11183.62]  and I was like,
[11183.70 --> 11183.82]  yeah,
[11183.90 --> 11184.24]  this is,
[11184.38 --> 11185.44]  I'm happy that there
[11185.44 --> 11186.34]  are teachers out there
[11186.34 --> 11187.18]  flip the script
[11187.18 --> 11189.16]  that like are right on
[11189.16 --> 11190.16]  with how this should work
[11190.16 --> 11191.42]  because I completely agree
[11191.42 --> 11191.94]  and she brought up
[11191.94 --> 11192.82]  comparisons to like,
[11192.86 --> 11194.00]  it's like when the calculator,
[11194.40 --> 11195.20]  she said that
[11195.20 --> 11196.32]  school should get harder
[11196.32 --> 11197.36]  because of it.
[11197.86 --> 11198.66]  And her point was
[11198.66 --> 11199.82]  because when the calculator
[11199.82 --> 11200.34]  came in,
[11200.42 --> 11201.82]  math classes got more advanced.
[11202.38 --> 11202.64]  She's like,
[11202.66 --> 11203.50]  the same thing should happen.
[11203.56 --> 11203.78]  I was like,
[11203.80 --> 11203.94]  yeah,
[11204.00 --> 11204.28]  totally.
[11204.28 --> 11206.52]  Can I just say that
[11206.52 --> 11207.94]  schools need to go back
[11207.94 --> 11208.60]  to teaching typing?
[11209.96 --> 11210.30]  Yeah.
[11210.86 --> 11212.28]  It is remarkable.
[11213.06 --> 11214.02]  I've actually started
[11214.02 --> 11215.46]  to notice a pattern here
[11215.46 --> 11217.72]  where the millennials
[11217.72 --> 11221.06]  in this company
[11221.06 --> 11223.64]  just sort of generally
[11223.64 --> 11225.92]  have much better typing skills
[11225.92 --> 11228.12]  than the Gen Z's
[11228.12 --> 11230.74]  and it was super unintuitive
[11230.74 --> 11231.86]  to me at first
[11231.86 --> 11235.08]  and then one of the Zoomers
[11235.08 --> 11235.96]  was like,
[11236.48 --> 11236.68]  yeah,
[11236.74 --> 11237.94]  they didn't like teach us
[11237.94 --> 11238.40]  home row
[11238.40 --> 11239.72]  and I was like,
[11239.80 --> 11240.58]  the fuck?
[11241.42 --> 11242.32]  That's actually weird.
[11242.56 --> 11243.48]  That's surprising to me.
[11243.94 --> 11244.58]  That to me,
[11244.68 --> 11244.80]  like,
[11244.86 --> 11245.10]  okay,
[11245.20 --> 11245.40]  fine.
[11245.56 --> 11246.40]  I suspect also a lot
[11246.40 --> 11247.14]  of the typing for them
[11247.14 --> 11247.72]  is done on their phones.
[11247.82 --> 11248.68]  Like drop cursive.
[11249.10 --> 11249.44]  Sure.
[11249.60 --> 11249.80]  Oh,
[11249.84 --> 11250.04]  yeah.
[11250.38 --> 11250.82]  All right,
[11250.92 --> 11251.22]  fine.
[11251.36 --> 11252.44]  Do they still teach cursive?
[11252.60 --> 11252.88]  No.
[11253.16 --> 11253.48]  Well,
[11253.48 --> 11253.76]  actually,
[11253.90 --> 11253.98]  well,
[11254.02 --> 11254.12]  no,
[11254.18 --> 11255.00]  at my kid's school they do.
[11255.32 --> 11255.62]  Wow.
[11255.74 --> 11256.02]  But not,
[11256.20 --> 11257.14]  it's not in the public
[11257.14 --> 11257.82]  curriculum here.
[11259.52 --> 11260.36]  But like,
[11263.70 --> 11265.42]  you need to know
[11265.42 --> 11266.38]  how to type still
[11266.38 --> 11268.96]  and not just know
[11268.96 --> 11269.62]  how to type,
[11269.90 --> 11270.62]  you need to know
[11270.62 --> 11272.30]  how to type fast.
[11272.56 --> 11272.76]  Yeah.
[11272.94 --> 11274.28]  Like there are
[11274.28 --> 11276.56]  so many parts of my job
[11276.56 --> 11277.48]  that I would be
[11277.48 --> 11280.24]  simply unable to do
[11280.24 --> 11281.42]  if I wasn't able
[11281.42 --> 11282.32]  to type at near
[11282.32 --> 11283.50]  transcription speed,
[11283.64 --> 11285.06]  whether it's just
[11285.06 --> 11286.20]  note taking in a meeting
[11286.20 --> 11287.82]  or getting my thoughts
[11287.82 --> 11289.06]  onto something
[11289.06 --> 11290.76]  as fast as they're
[11290.76 --> 11291.56]  happening.
[11291.84 --> 11292.02]  Like I,
[11292.48 --> 11294.06]  it's necessary
[11294.06 --> 11294.88]  to function.
[11295.08 --> 11295.36]  I don't.
[11295.70 --> 11296.58]  I've been talking about
[11296.58 --> 11297.50]  this far too much lately,
[11297.50 --> 11298.70]  but you want to know
[11298.70 --> 11299.62]  something that's very funny
[11299.62 --> 11300.92]  with my dyslexic stuff?
[11301.42 --> 11301.62]  Yeah.
[11301.68 --> 11302.80]  I can type significantly
[11302.80 --> 11303.80]  faster than I can read.
[11305.08 --> 11306.02]  I believe that.
[11307.20 --> 11308.10]  I'm intimidated
[11308.10 --> 11308.76]  by you guys
[11308.76 --> 11309.40]  in that office.
[11310.14 --> 11310.36]  Why?
[11310.50 --> 11310.74]  Why?
[11310.74 --> 11312.10]  You type so fast
[11312.10 --> 11313.86]  all the time.
[11313.86 --> 11314.96]  Because he's with like
[11314.96 --> 11315.74]  Jaden and me.
[11315.74 --> 11316.56]  You got programmers
[11316.56 --> 11317.66]  and writers there
[11317.66 --> 11318.20]  and I'm like,
[11318.26 --> 11319.60]  I'm using the arrow keys
[11319.60 --> 11320.36]  because I'm just working
[11320.36 --> 11320.94]  in Excel.
[11321.08 --> 11321.66]  So it's just like
[11321.66 --> 11322.56]  click, click
[11322.56 --> 11323.62]  and then maybe
[11323.62 --> 11324.50]  I'll type a sentence
[11324.50 --> 11325.06]  or two.
[11325.30 --> 11326.16]  You can tab
[11326.16 --> 11326.68]  if you're just trying
[11326.68 --> 11327.30]  to move to the right.
[11327.48 --> 11328.32]  How fast are you?
[11329.02 --> 11329.56]  You've got to be
[11329.56 --> 11330.20]  pretty fast.
[11330.24 --> 11331.20]  It's got to be near 100.
[11331.42 --> 11332.72]  Because I can't read
[11332.72 --> 11333.40]  properly,
[11333.46 --> 11334.38]  it's really hard to gauge
[11334.38 --> 11337.02]  because a lot of them
[11337.02 --> 11337.72]  you have to read.
[11337.82 --> 11339.48]  So where I'll get stuck
[11339.48 --> 11340.74]  is I'll type in
[11340.74 --> 11341.54]  the wrong word.
[11341.54 --> 11342.62]  I won't even necessarily
[11342.62 --> 11343.38]  typo the word.
[11343.46 --> 11344.48]  It'll just be the wrong word.
[11344.74 --> 11347.16]  But I've gotten
[11347.16 --> 11348.02]  one of those tests
[11348.02 --> 11349.00]  where I just read
[11349.00 --> 11350.26]  the thing a bunch of times
[11350.26 --> 11351.38]  and then tried to recite
[11351.38 --> 11351.88]  it from memory
[11351.88 --> 11352.90]  and I was at like 110
[11352.90 --> 11353.64]  or something.
[11353.78 --> 11354.50]  Okay, yeah.
[11354.54 --> 11355.64]  I've never been like
[11355.64 --> 11356.88]  amazing,
[11357.18 --> 11358.52]  but I've always been like
[11358.52 --> 11360.00]  well better than average.
[11360.16 --> 11361.32]  I'm kind of freaky deaky.
[11362.78 --> 11364.62]  Yeah, sometimes I'll fly too.
[11364.68 --> 11365.04]  I don't know where
[11365.04 --> 11365.76]  that comes from.
[11365.92 --> 11367.18]  I can, okay,
[11367.26 --> 11368.30]  maybe it's the same as me.
[11368.38 --> 11369.22]  I'll give you my theory.
[11369.22 --> 11371.34]  Because I can type in bursts
[11371.34 --> 11373.76]  incredibly quickly.
[11374.16 --> 11375.60]  But if I try to like
[11375.60 --> 11376.50]  marathon it,
[11376.58 --> 11377.56]  I almost kind of like
[11377.56 --> 11378.58]  lose my spot.
[11378.74 --> 11380.50]  So when I do a typing test,
[11380.86 --> 11383.06]  I tend to start making
[11383.06 --> 11384.20]  a whole bunch of mistakes.
[11384.72 --> 11386.40]  And I think it's from IMing.
[11388.38 --> 11389.96]  The vast majority
[11389.96 --> 11391.16]  of the typing I've done
[11391.16 --> 11391.58]  in my life,
[11391.68 --> 11392.80]  probably still,
[11393.50 --> 11394.30]  is like
[11394.30 --> 11399.04]  totally
[11399.04 --> 11400.22]  that makes so much sense.
[11400.36 --> 11401.18]  Reply to message.
[11402.36 --> 11403.06]  Reply, reply.
[11403.80 --> 11404.72]  Reply, enter.
[11405.12 --> 11405.34]  Haha.
[11405.76 --> 11405.98]  Well,
[11406.48 --> 11408.08]  but like it's
[11408.08 --> 11409.00]  I think there's also
[11409.00 --> 11409.66]  I type.
[11409.86 --> 11410.36]  I think there's also
[11410.36 --> 11411.06]  something to it
[11411.06 --> 11412.34]  with typing styles.
[11412.68 --> 11413.72]  Like if you go to do
[11413.72 --> 11414.68]  a typing test,
[11414.82 --> 11416.06]  it's often like,
[11416.22 --> 11416.80]  oh, you're going to
[11416.80 --> 11417.70]  do this passage
[11417.70 --> 11418.40]  from this book
[11418.40 --> 11418.86]  or something.
[11419.04 --> 11419.14]  Sure.
[11419.30 --> 11420.10]  And it's in a totally
[11420.10 --> 11420.78]  different style
[11420.78 --> 11421.96]  that you're not used to
[11421.96 --> 11422.94]  whatever else.
[11422.94 --> 11424.50]  and you might be
[11424.50 --> 11425.20]  able to flow state
[11425.20 --> 11425.98]  into your specific
[11425.98 --> 11427.20]  style significantly
[11427.20 --> 11427.68]  better.
[11428.60 --> 11429.28]  So I don't know
[11429.28 --> 11429.98]  how reflective
[11429.98 --> 11430.96]  it really is
[11430.96 --> 11431.42]  of like how
[11431.42 --> 11432.18]  your actual real
[11432.18 --> 11433.02]  real world
[11433.02 --> 11433.86]  performance is
[11433.86 --> 11434.36]  over the course
[11434.36 --> 11434.78]  of a day.
[11435.02 --> 11435.16]  Yeah.
[11436.78 --> 11437.52]  But yeah,
[11437.52 --> 11437.94]  I don't know.
[11438.18 --> 11438.92]  I've always thought
[11438.92 --> 11440.86]  I'm like quick,
[11441.02 --> 11442.06]  not necessarily
[11442.06 --> 11443.06]  super fast.
[11443.28 --> 11443.68]  Yeah.
[11443.74 --> 11444.80]  Just because I know
[11444.80 --> 11445.52]  there's people out there
[11445.52 --> 11446.08]  that would just
[11446.08 --> 11447.50]  stomp on me.
[11447.80 --> 11448.26]  People are calling
[11448.26 --> 11448.84]  for a Linus
[11448.84 --> 11449.92]  versus loop type off.
[11450.04 --> 11450.34]  Oh no.
[11450.46 --> 11451.56]  No, we're not doing that.
[11451.80 --> 11451.90]  Yeah.
[11451.90 --> 11453.22]  That's,
[11453.44 --> 11453.80]  yeah.
[11454.56 --> 11454.94]  I mean,
[11455.04 --> 11455.34]  okay.
[11455.86 --> 11456.24]  A,
[11456.78 --> 11458.36]  Luke is very open
[11458.36 --> 11459.70]  about his dyslexia,
[11460.26 --> 11460.88]  which is like,
[11461.08 --> 11462.40]  that would actually
[11462.40 --> 11463.30]  be like super annoying.
[11463.62 --> 11463.84]  Yeah.
[11463.94 --> 11464.92]  I really don't want
[11464.92 --> 11465.30]  to do that.
[11465.46 --> 11466.40]  I would crush him,
[11466.50 --> 11467.46]  but only because he
[11467.46 --> 11468.54]  like has an actual
[11468.54 --> 11469.48]  learning disability.
[11469.68 --> 11470.48]  That's not cool.
[11472.54 --> 11473.52]  I've always hated
[11473.52 --> 11474.12]  typing tests
[11474.12 --> 11475.02]  because of this reason.
[11475.18 --> 11475.92]  Because I'll be like
[11475.92 --> 11477.40]  quick and like doing
[11477.40 --> 11477.68]  good.
[11477.74 --> 11478.00]  And then people
[11478.00 --> 11478.30]  will be like,
[11478.34 --> 11478.84]  oh, how fast
[11478.84 --> 11479.62]  do you do a typing test?
[11479.62 --> 11480.00]  And I'm like,
[11480.12 --> 11481.84]  that's not,
[11482.00 --> 11483.06]  that's actually not
[11483.06 --> 11483.36]  funny.
[11483.36 --> 11483.94]  You guys,
[11484.08 --> 11485.40]  even though I'm laughing.
[11486.78 --> 11487.18]  Yeah.
[11487.22 --> 11488.18]  It's funny between us.
[11488.30 --> 11488.54]  We're fine.
[11489.26 --> 11489.62]  Yeah,
[11489.72 --> 11490.08]  but it's,
[11490.20 --> 11490.74]  that's not,
[11490.82 --> 11491.42]  we're not proving
[11491.42 --> 11491.98]  anything.
[11492.16 --> 11492.34]  Yeah.
[11492.50 --> 11492.76]  It's,
[11492.82 --> 11493.70]  it's like my car's
[11493.70 --> 11494.30]  out of gas
[11494.30 --> 11494.84]  and Luke's like,
[11494.88 --> 11495.60]  let's drag race.
[11496.28 --> 11496.94]  Get owned.
[11497.08 --> 11497.62]  And then I'm like,
[11497.82 --> 11498.36]  ha ha.
[11498.46 --> 11499.28]  My car's electric.
[11500.92 --> 11501.94]  You got there ahead of me.
[11501.94 --> 11504.86]  Oh,
[11505.16 --> 11505.56]  what was I,
[11505.62 --> 11506.14]  what was I going to say?
[11506.20 --> 11506.54]  Also,
[11506.66 --> 11506.82]  right.
[11506.94 --> 11508.12]  Number two is these are
[11508.12 --> 11509.06]  not familiar keyboards
[11509.06 --> 11510.10]  for either of us.
[11510.24 --> 11510.42]  Yeah.
[11510.50 --> 11511.80]  But we've also talked
[11511.80 --> 11513.18]  in the past about how
[11513.18 --> 11514.40]  as much as I like my
[11514.40 --> 11515.28]  full size mechanic
[11515.28 --> 11515.74]  keyboard,
[11515.88 --> 11516.24]  all that kind of,
[11516.26 --> 11516.40]  well,
[11516.52 --> 11516.82]  10 kilos,
[11516.94 --> 11517.20]  but whatever.
[11517.68 --> 11518.40]  Mechanical keyboard,
[11518.54 --> 11518.92]  big boys.
[11519.00 --> 11519.42]  I was going to ask
[11519.42 --> 11520.30]  what a mechanic keyboard
[11520.30 --> 11520.52]  is.
[11520.56 --> 11521.20]  Does it have a wrench
[11521.20 --> 11521.62]  built in?
[11524.16 --> 11525.28]  I wouldn't be surprised
[11525.28 --> 11526.18]  if one of those existed.
[11527.10 --> 11528.08]  But yeah,
[11528.08 --> 11528.96]  the flat keys
[11528.96 --> 11530.16]  were both pretty fast.
[11530.24 --> 11531.06]  I remember this conversation
[11531.06 --> 11531.72]  a long time ago.
[11531.72 --> 11533.90]  I did a video recently
[11533.90 --> 11536.08]  just using like random
[11536.08 --> 11537.94]  keyboards off of AliExpress
[11537.94 --> 11538.80]  or Wish or something
[11538.80 --> 11539.38]  like that.
[11539.78 --> 11540.52]  And one of the ones,
[11540.76 --> 11541.94]  I would say like over
[11541.94 --> 11542.94]  a hundred words per minute,
[11543.02 --> 11543.34]  I think,
[11543.40 --> 11545.00]  on some absolute piece
[11545.00 --> 11545.68]  of garbage.
[11545.68 --> 11545.86]  Yeah.
[11546.58 --> 11547.32]  Because it was just
[11547.32 --> 11548.52]  a really low profile
[11548.52 --> 11549.10]  key switch.
[11549.24 --> 11550.16]  And I managed to enter
[11550.16 --> 11551.08]  flow state and I'm like,
[11551.44 --> 11551.74]  okay,
[11551.88 --> 11552.12]  guys,
[11552.22 --> 11555.26]  this is not a good keyboard.
[11555.46 --> 11556.32]  Don't read it too much
[11556.32 --> 11556.92]  into this.
[11557.20 --> 11557.42]  Yeah.
[11560.00 --> 11560.40]  Okay.
[11560.52 --> 11560.84]  Some more?
[11561.32 --> 11561.50]  Yeah.
[11561.72 --> 11562.52]  Hi.
[11562.74 --> 11564.68]  Guy we're all friends here for.
[11564.88 --> 11565.88]  Guy we're all here for.
[11566.00 --> 11567.00]  Luke Linus
[11567.00 --> 11568.44]  with Arm going public,
[11568.84 --> 11570.28]  success of Apple Silicon
[11570.28 --> 11571.34]  and the announcement
[11571.34 --> 11572.82]  of Assassin's Creed
[11572.82 --> 11573.78]  on iPhone.
[11574.24 --> 11575.58]  What's your best guess timeline
[11575.58 --> 11577.42]  for serious risk adoption
[11577.42 --> 11578.02]  for gaming?
[11579.14 --> 11580.06]  I mean,
[11580.16 --> 11581.02]  it's already happening.
[11582.24 --> 11582.46]  Yeah.
[11583.10 --> 11583.62]  Any,
[11583.76 --> 11585.34]  any mobile game,
[11585.94 --> 11587.46]  mobile gaming is huge.
[11587.56 --> 11587.68]  I mean,
[11587.68 --> 11588.76]  isn't the mobile gaming industry
[11588.76 --> 11589.32]  by revenue,
[11589.32 --> 11590.10]  like bigger
[11590.10 --> 11591.16]  than console gaming?
[11591.48 --> 11592.50]  I can't remember.
[11592.66 --> 11593.56]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[11593.56 --> 11594.56]  I don't know if it's bigger
[11594.56 --> 11595.26]  or smaller,
[11595.44 --> 11595.82]  but it's,
[11597.22 --> 11597.82]  they're on the,
[11597.88 --> 11599.16]  they're in the same conversation.
[11599.32 --> 11600.32]  That I know for sure.
[11600.74 --> 11601.78]  Risk gaming is a thing.
[11601.88 --> 11602.70]  It's just whether or not
[11602.70 --> 11604.70]  you consider mobile gaming
[11604.70 --> 11606.18]  to be real gaming or not,
[11606.24 --> 11606.54]  but it's,
[11606.54 --> 11607.44]  it's definitely a thing.
[11607.44 --> 11608.16]  I didn't know this.
[11608.30 --> 11609.88]  Resident Evil 4 remake
[11609.88 --> 11611.48]  and Assassin's Creed Mirage,
[11611.54 --> 11612.50]  which is the new one coming out,
[11612.54 --> 11613.34]  are coming to iPhone?
[11614.18 --> 11616.14]  The Resident Evil 4 remake footage
[11616.14 --> 11617.08]  from the Apple event
[11617.08 --> 11618.38]  looks incredible.
[11619.08 --> 11620.46]  This is huge.
[11620.70 --> 11620.90]  Yeah.
[11621.00 --> 11622.14]  How have I not heard of this?
[11622.48 --> 11623.68]  Because you didn't watch our video.
[11624.16 --> 11625.48]  I didn't watch the Apple event at all
[11625.48 --> 11626.72]  because I'm not going to buy an Apple.
[11626.72 --> 11626.90]  Well,
[11626.90 --> 11628.42]  you should watch our video at least.
[11628.64 --> 11630.68]  We focused on USB-C and gaming.
[11630.80 --> 11631.82]  You're not going to buy anything.
[11631.86 --> 11632.82]  The stuff that actually,
[11632.82 --> 11634.62]  I should watch it.
[11634.76 --> 11635.06]  I'll watch it.
[11635.06 --> 11636.18]  This man right here.
[11636.18 --> 11636.64]  I'll watch it.
[11636.64 --> 11637.66]  This man gets it.
[11638.08 --> 11638.98]  I learned.
[11639.18 --> 11639.88]  I learned.
[11640.58 --> 11641.34]  So Luke,
[11641.40 --> 11642.62]  you excited about the no.
[11646.00 --> 11646.40]  Or,
[11646.62 --> 11647.14]  alternately,
[11647.50 --> 11647.70]  Luke,
[11647.74 --> 11648.56]  are you excited about the,
[11648.72 --> 11649.02]  yeah,
[11649.16 --> 11649.66]  are you going to buy it?
[11649.70 --> 11649.90]  No.
[11650.82 --> 11651.26]  Yeah.
[11651.36 --> 11652.64]  I like the concept of it.
[11653.78 --> 11655.06]  I like that somebody else
[11655.06 --> 11656.30]  will buy and enjoy it.
[11656.54 --> 11656.74]  Hey,
[11656.80 --> 11657.10]  that's a,
[11657.10 --> 11658.02]  that's a thing I feel
[11658.02 --> 11659.00]  from time to time.
[11659.10 --> 11660.42]  He's got the compersion over here.
[11660.60 --> 11660.80]  Yeah.
[11661.02 --> 11661.30]  But no,
[11661.34 --> 11662.08]  that's super cool.
[11662.24 --> 11662.58]  I don't know.
[11662.58 --> 11663.66]  I'm happy to hear about that.
[11663.76 --> 11664.96]  I guess everyone else already knows,
[11665.24 --> 11666.54]  but I'm happy to hear about that.
[11666.66 --> 11666.76]  Yeah.
[11666.78 --> 11667.42]  It's very cool.
[11667.52 --> 11668.72]  That's actually like massive
[11668.72 --> 11671.50]  because phone gaming blows.
[11672.78 --> 11674.06]  All the games like suck.
[11674.28 --> 11675.54]  So if phones are going to get
[11675.54 --> 11676.52]  desktop quality games,
[11676.66 --> 11677.80]  also a massive market.
[11678.36 --> 11678.94]  Like an insane.
[11679.32 --> 11679.48]  Yeah.
[11679.60 --> 11680.56]  Don't you guys have phones?
[11681.32 --> 11682.76]  Some people only have phones.
[11683.00 --> 11683.72]  It's just true.
[11683.88 --> 11685.10]  So like a lot of people
[11685.10 --> 11686.14]  don't have consoles
[11686.14 --> 11687.18]  or gaming computers.
[11688.92 --> 11690.06]  So I don't know,
[11690.18 --> 11690.38]  getting,
[11690.38 --> 11691.28]  getting more games
[11691.28 --> 11692.18]  to more people sounds cool.
[11692.18 --> 11692.54]  Why not?
[11692.64 --> 11692.80]  Yeah.
[11692.86 --> 11693.10]  Sweet.
[11696.20 --> 11696.42]  Yeah.
[11696.90 --> 11697.26]  Anyways,
[11697.40 --> 11697.78]  next one.
[11697.92 --> 11698.14]  Okay.
[11698.22 --> 11698.40]  Sure.
[11699.40 --> 11699.80]  Hey,
[11699.96 --> 11700.54]  LLD.
[11700.86 --> 11702.72]  I wanted L and L's opinion
[11702.72 --> 11703.68]  on Asus
[11703.68 --> 11704.28]  charging me
[11704.28 --> 11705.36]  $705
[11705.36 --> 11707.72]  to replace an LCD
[11707.72 --> 11708.64]  in the
[11708.64 --> 11710.42]  XG49VQ.
[11710.70 --> 11711.68]  An $800
[11711.68 --> 11712.72]  gaming monitor.
[11712.72 --> 11714.56]  I expected to pay
[11714.56 --> 11716.10]  if it fell
[11716.10 --> 11717.80]  but not 88%
[11717.80 --> 11718.86]  the cost
[11718.86 --> 11719.86]  of the new product.
[11721.64 --> 11722.24]  Okay.
[11722.82 --> 11723.32]  So
[11723.32 --> 11724.78]  here's the thing.
[11725.02 --> 11725.86]  On the one hand,
[11726.62 --> 11727.34]  that blows.
[11728.40 --> 11729.58]  On the other hand,
[11730.10 --> 11730.86]  this product
[11730.86 --> 11732.06]  is the panel.
[11733.06 --> 11733.46]  Yeah.
[11733.82 --> 11734.76]  I thought you were talking
[11734.76 --> 11735.74]  of laptop at first.
[11736.46 --> 11736.98]  Yeah,
[11737.06 --> 11737.38]  that's,
[11737.46 --> 11738.32]  that's really tough.
[11738.32 --> 11739.50]  And Asus
[11739.50 --> 11740.94]  rightfully
[11740.94 --> 11741.66]  doesn't have
[11741.66 --> 11742.74]  a pristine reputation
[11742.74 --> 11743.92]  when it comes to
[11743.92 --> 11745.12]  repair
[11745.12 --> 11746.78]  and servicing.
[11747.58 --> 11749.20]  But with that said,
[11749.20 --> 11751.90]  ah,
[11751.98 --> 11752.28]  man,
[11752.74 --> 11754.66]  the amount of labor
[11754.66 --> 11755.46]  involved in
[11755.46 --> 11756.56]  unmanufacturing
[11756.56 --> 11757.32]  the panelness
[11757.32 --> 11758.12]  and then putting it
[11758.12 --> 11758.72]  back together
[11758.72 --> 11761.14]  on this curved display
[11761.14 --> 11762.34]  is probably
[11762.34 --> 11764.30]  not that dissimilar
[11764.30 --> 11765.26]  to the labor of
[11765.26 --> 11766.32]  assembling
[11766.32 --> 11768.34]  the whole thing
[11768.34 --> 11769.22]  in the first place.
[11769.82 --> 11770.70]  And the actual
[11770.70 --> 11772.14]  guts of this monitor
[11772.14 --> 11773.42]  are pretty minimal
[11773.42 --> 11774.82]  compared to
[11774.82 --> 11775.56]  the
[11775.56 --> 11776.70]  panel
[11776.70 --> 11777.80]  in terms of cost.
[11777.80 --> 11778.90]  Um,
[11779.50 --> 11783.18]  you paid for a new monitor
[11783.18 --> 11783.72]  because
[11783.72 --> 11784.68]  you basically
[11784.68 --> 11785.54]  bought a new monitor
[11785.54 --> 11786.92]  is kind of my,
[11786.98 --> 11787.30]  uh,
[11787.50 --> 11788.14]  my take on it.
[11788.18 --> 11788.34]  That,
[11788.44 --> 11789.30]  that really sucks
[11789.30 --> 11790.26]  and I feel really
[11790.26 --> 11791.74]  bad for your situation.
[11794.34 --> 11795.18]  I'm sorry.
[11795.52 --> 11795.74]  Yeah,
[11796.04 --> 11796.50]  that blows.
[11796.90 --> 11797.14]  Yeah.
[11797.84 --> 11798.66]  But also,
[11798.80 --> 11798.90]  like,
[11799.08 --> 11799.64]  what he said.
[11800.58 --> 11801.10]  Sorry.
[11802.18 --> 11802.90]  Good day
[11802.90 --> 11803.80]  from Down Under.
[11804.08 --> 11804.80]  I recently
[11804.80 --> 11805.60]  e-cycled
[11805.60 --> 11806.40]  a first-gen
[11806.40 --> 11806.84]  plasma
[11806.84 --> 11807.72]  that was perfectly
[11807.72 --> 11808.12]  working
[11808.12 --> 11808.96]  but made
[11808.96 --> 11809.52]  no sense
[11809.52 --> 11809.90]  using.
[11810.36 --> 11810.66]  Linus,
[11810.76 --> 11811.80]  we know
[11811.80 --> 11812.26]  you love
[11812.26 --> 11812.62]  pebble.
[11813.06 --> 11813.82]  What is the point
[11813.82 --> 11814.38]  you decide
[11814.38 --> 11814.76]  to move
[11814.76 --> 11815.44]  tech on?
[11816.44 --> 11816.72]  Okay,
[11816.84 --> 11817.40]  I actually
[11817.40 --> 11817.94]  flagged this
[11817.94 --> 11818.36]  not because
[11818.36 --> 11818.88]  I could think
[11818.88 --> 11819.42]  of any answer
[11819.42 --> 11820.08]  to that question
[11820.08 --> 11821.44]  but to say
[11821.44 --> 11822.06]  really?
[11823.46 --> 11824.62]  You e-cycled
[11824.62 --> 11825.32]  a first-gen
[11825.32 --> 11825.82]  plasma
[11825.82 --> 11826.60]  that was
[11826.60 --> 11827.40]  perfectly worth?
[11827.64 --> 11828.10]  Do you have
[11828.10 --> 11828.58]  any idea
[11828.58 --> 11828.92]  how much
[11828.92 --> 11829.32]  those things
[11829.32 --> 11829.84]  are worth?
[11829.84 --> 11831.82]  I ran
[11831.82 --> 11832.46]  one for years
[11832.46 --> 11832.86]  and it had
[11832.86 --> 11833.48]  a chopstick
[11833.48 --> 11834.00]  sticking out
[11834.00 --> 11834.38]  of the front
[11834.38 --> 11834.66]  of it
[11834.66 --> 11835.20]  because the
[11835.20 --> 11835.64]  fix was
[11835.64 --> 11836.26]  to distend
[11836.26 --> 11836.76]  the panel
[11836.76 --> 11837.14]  by a
[11837.14 --> 11837.52]  sixteenth
[11837.52 --> 11837.96]  of an inch.
[11839.96 --> 11840.36]  Okay,
[11840.50 --> 11840.64]  well,
[11840.74 --> 11841.72]  Dan's a unique
[11841.72 --> 11842.08]  case,
[11842.24 --> 11842.60]  but...
[11842.60 --> 11842.98]  They last
[11842.98 --> 11843.32]  forever.
[11843.32 --> 11844.46]  But dang
[11844.46 --> 11844.74]  it!
[11847.72 --> 11848.08]  Right,
[11848.24 --> 11848.46]  okay,
[11848.60 --> 11849.30]  so when do
[11849.30 --> 11850.38]  I move on?
[11850.60 --> 11850.84]  You know,
[11850.96 --> 11851.52]  I kind of
[11851.52 --> 11851.80]  move on
[11851.80 --> 11852.20]  naturally.
[11852.34 --> 11852.64]  I kind of
[11852.64 --> 11853.00]  move on
[11853.00 --> 11853.74]  when I just
[11853.74 --> 11854.42]  don't use it
[11854.42 --> 11854.70]  anymore.
[11854.80 --> 11855.20]  If I haven't
[11855.20 --> 11855.74]  used something
[11855.74 --> 11856.14]  in a long
[11856.14 --> 11856.42]  time,
[11856.54 --> 11857.16]  I moved
[11857.16 --> 11857.46]  on.
[11858.70 --> 11858.94]  I mean,
[11858.98 --> 11859.40]  part of that
[11859.40 --> 11859.86]  is that it's
[11859.86 --> 11860.50]  like my job
[11860.50 --> 11861.20]  to try new
[11861.20 --> 11861.68]  stuff all the
[11861.68 --> 11861.90]  time.
[11863.66 --> 11864.46]  Fair enough.
[11864.92 --> 11865.60]  But I mean,
[11865.68 --> 11866.28]  I somewhat
[11866.28 --> 11867.02]  feel the same.
[11867.32 --> 11867.56]  Yeah,
[11867.88 --> 11868.14]  yeah,
[11868.28 --> 11869.98]  I'm ready
[11869.98 --> 11870.46]  to move on
[11870.46 --> 11870.76]  from my
[11870.76 --> 11871.14]  Note 9,
[11871.26 --> 11871.68]  for example.
[11871.76 --> 11872.04]  I have a
[11872.04 --> 11872.56]  video coming.
[11872.56 --> 11873.28]  This is going
[11873.28 --> 11873.48]  to be,
[11873.64 --> 11873.80]  I think,
[11873.80 --> 11874.04]  a really
[11874.04 --> 11874.54]  fun video.
[11875.60 --> 11876.16]  I flipped
[11876.16 --> 11876.60]  the script.
[11877.02 --> 11877.70]  We actually
[11877.70 --> 11878.44]  created a
[11878.44 --> 11879.10]  giant Uno
[11879.10 --> 11879.96]  reverse card
[11879.96 --> 11881.00]  prop for
[11881.00 --> 11881.38]  the video,
[11881.76 --> 11883.44]  and I'm
[11883.44 --> 11884.34]  going to
[11884.34 --> 11886.42]  lay out
[11886.42 --> 11887.08]  my requirements,
[11887.62 --> 11888.24]  and then I'm
[11888.24 --> 11888.50]  going to have
[11888.50 --> 11888.90]  the audience
[11888.90 --> 11889.36]  pick me a
[11889.36 --> 11889.56]  phone.
[11890.40 --> 11890.88]  Then no
[11890.88 --> 11891.28]  matter what
[11891.28 --> 11891.52]  it is,
[11891.54 --> 11891.72]  I'm going
[11891.72 --> 11892.00]  to use
[11892.00 --> 11892.18]  it.
[11894.18 --> 11894.68]  No matter
[11894.68 --> 11895.22]  what it is.
[11895.36 --> 11895.44]  Cool.
[11896.44 --> 11897.52]  And for a
[11897.52 --> 11898.16]  period of time,
[11898.28 --> 11898.72]  and there are
[11898.72 --> 11899.06]  a few
[11899.06 --> 11899.62]  requirements,
[11899.74 --> 11899.94]  you guys
[11899.94 --> 11900.18]  will have to
[11900.18 --> 11900.46]  watch the
[11900.46 --> 11900.90]  video to get
[11900.90 --> 11901.12]  all the
[11901.12 --> 11901.46]  details,
[11901.60 --> 11901.90]  but I think
[11901.90 --> 11902.18]  it's going
[11902.18 --> 11902.38]  to be,
[11902.38 --> 11902.60]  I think
[11902.60 --> 11902.80]  it's going
[11902.80 --> 11902.92]  to be
[11902.92 --> 11903.38]  pretty cool,
[11904.00 --> 11904.66]  and hopefully,
[11905.06 --> 11905.78]  where is my
[11905.78 --> 11905.94]  phone?
[11905.96 --> 11906.06]  Oh,
[11906.06 --> 11906.24]  right,
[11906.28 --> 11906.62]  I chucked it
[11906.62 --> 11906.88]  over there.
[11906.94 --> 11907.16]  Hopefully,
[11907.26 --> 11907.70]  I end up with
[11907.70 --> 11908.34]  something a little
[11908.34 --> 11909.60]  bit faster than
[11909.60 --> 11910.50]  the Note 9 at
[11910.50 --> 11910.82]  this point.
[11910.94 --> 11911.12]  It's,
[11911.22 --> 11912.86]  it's slow.
[11914.34 --> 11915.00]  It's usable.
[11915.44 --> 11915.66]  Like,
[11915.72 --> 11916.48]  I am dailying it
[11916.48 --> 11916.88]  right now,
[11916.92 --> 11917.50]  ever since my
[11917.50 --> 11918.34]  fold got dropped
[11918.34 --> 11918.68]  in the pool,
[11918.80 --> 11919.52]  but I am,
[11919.60 --> 11920.58]  it's slow.
[11920.58 --> 11923.34]  What made you
[11923.34 --> 11924.24]  decide to do the
[11924.24 --> 11925.02]  first and second
[11925.02 --> 11925.82]  what is it like
[11925.82 --> 11926.50]  to work for
[11926.50 --> 11927.40]  Linus videos?
[11927.78 --> 11928.36]  Are there any
[11928.36 --> 11929.08]  stories behind
[11929.08 --> 11929.28]  them?
[11929.52 --> 11930.30]  And thanks to
[11930.30 --> 11931.24]  Joseph Drive for
[11931.24 --> 11932.14]  helping me subscribe
[11932.14 --> 11932.66]  to Flowplane.
[11933.10 --> 11934.06]  The first one was
[11934.06 --> 11935.40]  just an idea that
[11935.40 --> 11936.04]  I had as an
[11936.04 --> 11936.66]  extension of the
[11936.66 --> 11937.32]  Honest Answers
[11937.32 --> 11938.46]  series, which
[11938.46 --> 11940.22]  includes other
[11940.22 --> 11941.28]  gems like how
[11941.28 --> 11941.74]  do we make
[11941.74 --> 11942.02]  money?
[11942.40 --> 11943.18]  And the goal
[11943.18 --> 11943.82]  was simply
[11943.82 --> 11944.46]  transparency.
[11944.46 --> 11945.66]  I told the
[11945.66 --> 11946.40]  staff internally
[11946.40 --> 11946.94]  at the time
[11946.94 --> 11947.36]  that I wouldn't
[11947.36 --> 11947.84]  watch them.
[11948.28 --> 11949.10]  And true to my
[11949.10 --> 11949.88]  word, I have not
[11949.88 --> 11950.94]  watched either of
[11950.94 --> 11951.62]  them up until
[11951.62 --> 11952.16]  this time.
[11953.36 --> 11954.26]  If I ever
[11954.26 --> 11955.04]  retired or
[11955.04 --> 11955.50]  something like
[11955.50 --> 11955.96]  that, I would
[11955.96 --> 11956.76]  consider it fair
[11956.76 --> 11958.12]  game to watch
[11958.12 --> 11958.28]  them.
[11958.50 --> 11959.48]  But as long as
[11959.48 --> 11961.02]  I'm working here,
[11961.06 --> 11961.64]  I'm not going to
[11961.64 --> 11962.08]  watch them.
[11962.50 --> 11963.32]  And I wanted
[11963.32 --> 11964.20]  people to have
[11964.20 --> 11965.26]  a real look
[11965.26 --> 11967.06]  into the inner
[11967.06 --> 11967.90]  workings of our
[11967.90 --> 11968.20]  company.
[11968.78 --> 11969.52]  And I think that
[11969.52 --> 11970.10]  the people who
[11970.10 --> 11970.66]  have worked on
[11970.66 --> 11971.18]  these projects
[11971.18 --> 11971.88]  have taken the
[11971.88 --> 11972.94]  assignment very
[11972.94 --> 11974.10]  seriously and to
[11974.10 --> 11974.64]  the greatest
[11974.64 --> 11975.14]  degree that
[11975.14 --> 11975.66]  they're able to
[11975.66 --> 11976.48]  provided a real
[11976.48 --> 11977.12]  window into our
[11977.12 --> 11977.44]  company.
[11977.66 --> 11978.64]  In some ways, I
[11978.64 --> 11978.98]  think that
[11978.98 --> 11979.80]  transparency has
[11979.80 --> 11980.16]  hurt us.
[11980.76 --> 11981.84]  I have seen
[11981.84 --> 11982.86]  parts of those
[11982.86 --> 11983.56]  videos pulled
[11983.56 --> 11984.76]  out, oftentimes
[11984.76 --> 11985.56]  without their
[11985.56 --> 11987.30]  full context, and
[11987.30 --> 11988.28]  used as an
[11988.28 --> 11988.96]  attack against
[11988.96 --> 11989.30]  us.
[11989.66 --> 11991.64]  But my answer
[11991.64 --> 11992.36]  to that would
[11992.36 --> 11993.62]  be that you
[11993.62 --> 11994.20]  guys are seeing
[11994.20 --> 11995.30]  a very incomplete
[11995.30 --> 11996.26]  picture if you're
[11996.26 --> 11996.82]  using that to
[11996.82 --> 11997.44]  attack us.
[11997.66 --> 11999.52]  And the very
[11999.52 --> 12000.46]  fact that we
[12000.46 --> 12001.18]  are willing to
[12001.18 --> 12001.84]  say those things
[12001.84 --> 12002.56]  about ourselves in
[12002.56 --> 12003.16]  public, I think,
[12003.28 --> 12004.08]  speaks to our
[12004.10 --> 12005.32]  transparency.
[12005.32 --> 12006.96]  I think that you
[12006.96 --> 12007.90]  can criticize a
[12007.90 --> 12009.66]  lot about us, but
[12009.66 --> 12012.66]  to turn around
[12012.66 --> 12013.86]  our commitment to
[12013.86 --> 12016.26]  being open and
[12016.26 --> 12017.38]  make a weapon out
[12017.38 --> 12018.96]  of that can only
[12018.96 --> 12019.92]  have one effect.
[12020.24 --> 12021.06]  And I'll give you
[12021.06 --> 12022.66]  three guesses as
[12022.66 --> 12023.32]  to what it is, and
[12023.32 --> 12023.80]  the first two
[12023.80 --> 12024.30]  don't count.
[12026.94 --> 12027.66]  What do you
[12027.66 --> 12028.16]  think it is?
[12028.26 --> 12028.58]  What do you
[12028.58 --> 12029.24]  think happens?
[12029.56 --> 12030.96]  When you take our
[12030.96 --> 12033.02]  ability to look at
[12033.02 --> 12033.82]  ourselves honestly
[12033.82 --> 12034.98]  and talk about it
[12034.98 --> 12036.44]  to you, and you
[12036.44 --> 12037.08]  turn it into a
[12037.08 --> 12037.34]  weapon?
[12040.34 --> 12040.96]  We're just going to
[12040.96 --> 12041.72]  not do that anymore.
[12042.40 --> 12043.40]  It's the Blizzard
[12043.40 --> 12045.10]  developer point that
[12045.10 --> 12045.78]  I've made a billion
[12045.78 --> 12046.66]  times on my show.
[12048.44 --> 12049.02]  So yeah.
[12049.08 --> 12049.70]  It is what it is.
[12049.88 --> 12051.32]  I can tell you right
[12051.32 --> 12051.96]  now, you will never
[12051.96 --> 12053.06]  see another video in
[12053.06 --> 12053.48]  that series.
[12054.02 --> 12054.38]  It's not going to
[12054.38 --> 12054.58]  happen.
[12054.58 --> 12056.28]  Why would we do
[12056.28 --> 12056.50]  that?
[12057.00 --> 12057.18]  Yeah.
[12057.54 --> 12058.10]  Let's just not.
[12060.32 --> 12061.00]  Up next.
[12061.40 --> 12061.58]  Yep.
[12061.78 --> 12062.50]  Given how much the
[12062.50 --> 12063.54]  algorithm rewards
[12063.54 --> 12064.62]  channels that upload
[12064.62 --> 12065.92]  frequently, what's the
[12065.92 --> 12066.94]  conversion like about
[12066.94 --> 12068.28]  getting back to daily
[12068.28 --> 12068.82]  uploads?
[12069.20 --> 12070.00]  Conversation, but yes.
[12070.74 --> 12071.22]  Oh, sorry.
[12071.38 --> 12071.92]  Yep, that's okay.
[12075.10 --> 12076.56]  Right now, there is
[12076.56 --> 12077.72]  no conversation about
[12077.72 --> 12078.00]  that.
[12078.10 --> 12079.02]  Right now, the
[12079.02 --> 12080.64]  conversation is, you
[12080.64 --> 12081.24]  know, how do we get
[12081.24 --> 12082.02]  back to basics?
[12082.62 --> 12084.22]  How do we delight the
[12084.22 --> 12084.60]  audience?
[12086.26 --> 12087.56]  And at some point,
[12088.04 --> 12088.92]  you know, obviously,
[12089.24 --> 12091.00]  as a media production
[12091.00 --> 12091.98]  company, yeah, we're
[12091.98 --> 12093.64]  going to try and, you
[12093.64 --> 12094.08]  know, we're going to
[12094.08 --> 12094.56]  try and grow.
[12095.16 --> 12096.48]  And grow means, you
[12096.48 --> 12097.70]  know, take these
[12097.70 --> 12098.48]  systems that we're
[12098.48 --> 12099.52]  working on that are
[12099.52 --> 12100.48]  going to help us make
[12100.48 --> 12101.66]  better content and make
[12101.66 --> 12102.24]  more of it.
[12102.38 --> 12105.64]  But right now, that's
[12105.64 --> 12107.28]  just, that's not in our
[12107.28 --> 12109.32]  vocabulary at the
[12109.32 --> 12109.60]  moment.
[12109.60 --> 12110.98]  When we, when we,
[12111.16 --> 12112.38]  when we produce a lot
[12112.38 --> 12113.46]  of videos, we're, we're
[12113.46 --> 12114.04]  really happy.
[12114.22 --> 12115.36]  And when we don't, we,
[12115.50 --> 12117.42]  we, we look at, okay,
[12117.42 --> 12117.86]  what were the
[12117.86 --> 12118.22]  challenges?
[12118.42 --> 12119.16]  What, what were the
[12119.16 --> 12120.14]  obstacles that we had to
[12120.14 --> 12120.80]  overcome here?
[12120.80 --> 12121.68]  And we, we try and
[12121.68 --> 12122.42]  figure out how to solve
[12122.42 --> 12122.60]  them.
[12122.60 --> 12123.42]  And we, we try and
[12123.42 --> 12124.00]  take that with us
[12124.00 --> 12124.52]  moving forward.
[12126.80 --> 12128.36]  Is the Swacket ever
[12128.36 --> 12129.02]  coming back?
[12129.14 --> 12130.28]  I absolutely loved it
[12130.28 --> 12131.38]  and don't want to buy
[12131.38 --> 12132.32]  one off eBay.
[12133.46 --> 12134.12]  Probably never.
[12136.22 --> 12136.62]  Sorry.
[12137.66 --> 12138.62]  I should be writing
[12138.62 --> 12139.18]  these down.
[12139.60 --> 12140.60]  I mean, okay, never is
[12140.60 --> 12141.20]  a strong word.
[12141.20 --> 12142.78]  Probably, probably not.
[12143.04 --> 12145.24]  It sold really well at
[12145.24 --> 12146.06]  the beginning, but you
[12146.06 --> 12146.76]  may or may not have
[12146.76 --> 12147.58]  noticed that we kind of
[12147.58 --> 12148.48]  did a clearance deal on
[12148.48 --> 12148.66]  it.
[12149.44 --> 12151.88]  So you can put two and
[12151.88 --> 12152.58]  two together probably.
[12154.48 --> 12155.66]  As an individual viewer,
[12156.02 --> 12157.72]  which generates the most
[12157.72 --> 12158.14]  revenue?
[12158.66 --> 12159.76]  A basic YouTube
[12159.76 --> 12161.62]  subscriber, a premium
[12161.62 --> 12163.52]  YouTube subscriber, or a
[12163.52 --> 12164.70]  float plane subscriber?
[12164.70 --> 12166.32]  By far a float plane
[12166.32 --> 12169.20]  subscriber because they
[12169.20 --> 12170.30]  are, they are, it's, it's
[12170.30 --> 12170.90]  kind of like being
[12170.90 --> 12171.88]  subscribed to a Patreon,
[12172.06 --> 12172.20]  right?
[12172.24 --> 12174.30]  Like a regular YouTube
[12174.30 --> 12176.12]  subscriber is going to be
[12176.12 --> 12177.42]  ad supported, which is a
[12177.42 --> 12179.92]  tiny fraction of the CPMs
[12179.92 --> 12181.06]  of a paid supported
[12181.06 --> 12182.74]  viewer who contributes a
[12182.74 --> 12184.50]  proportion of their YouTube
[12184.50 --> 12185.94]  premium revenue, which is
[12185.94 --> 12187.22]  going to be a tiny, well,
[12187.26 --> 12188.06]  maybe not a tiny fraction,
[12188.14 --> 12189.58]  but a fraction of what
[12189.58 --> 12190.90]  someone who is directly
[12190.90 --> 12192.18]  paying you for the content
[12192.18 --> 12193.50]  is going to contribute to
[12193.50 --> 12193.98]  the bottom line.
[12193.98 --> 12194.88]  Their float plane peeps
[12194.88 --> 12197.94]  are hugely important to
[12197.94 --> 12198.26]  us.
[12198.42 --> 12200.80]  And, um, I, I can't, I
[12200.80 --> 12201.56]  can't thank them enough.
[12201.62 --> 12202.36]  I can never thank them
[12202.36 --> 12202.60]  enough.
[12204.30 --> 12205.76]  Even the $3 ones are
[12205.76 --> 12207.28]  probably still better for
[12207.28 --> 12209.54]  us than a heavy watcher
[12209.54 --> 12210.32]  on YouTube premium
[12210.32 --> 12211.84]  actually borderline
[12211.84 --> 12212.22]  actually.
[12212.54 --> 12213.48]  No, maybe not.
[12214.16 --> 12215.02]  No, maybe not.
[12215.10 --> 12216.32]  I have really heavy YouTube
[12216.32 --> 12217.94]  premium watcher would be
[12217.94 --> 12220.00]  more than like an OG tier
[12220.00 --> 12221.32]  float plane watcher just
[12221.32 --> 12222.34]  because premium costs so
[12222.34 --> 12222.66]  much.
[12222.66 --> 12224.56]  Um, you'd have to be a
[12224.56 --> 12225.54]  really heavy watcher and
[12225.54 --> 12227.30]  also watch very little of
[12227.30 --> 12227.84]  anything else.
[12227.90 --> 12228.08]  Yes.
[12228.62 --> 12229.20]  Yeah, that's true.
[12229.20 --> 12229.98]  Cause it's proportional
[12229.98 --> 12230.88]  based on watch time.
[12231.04 --> 12231.98]  So you'd have to fall
[12231.98 --> 12234.54]  asleep to like, by how to
[12234.54 --> 12235.28]  build a PC, the last
[12235.28 --> 12236.68]  guide you'll ever need
[12236.68 --> 12237.84]  like over and over again.
[12237.84 --> 12238.96]  And also never watch any
[12238.96 --> 12239.64]  other creators.
[12239.88 --> 12240.28]  Yeah.
[12240.28 --> 12241.68]  So I don't know.
[12242.06 --> 12243.46]  Hey, I'll float plane chat.
[12243.60 --> 12244.06]  Thanks guys.
[12244.26 --> 12244.48]  Yeah.
[12244.56 --> 12245.10]  Bread planes.
[12245.42 --> 12246.10]  Let's go.
[12248.14 --> 12249.96]  Linus in an old video, you
[12249.96 --> 12251.28]  said you did not want to
[12251.28 --> 12252.08]  hire Riley.
[12252.50 --> 12253.66]  Why did you decide to hire
[12253.66 --> 12254.28]  him eventually?
[12254.60 --> 12255.76]  Would there be any impact
[12255.76 --> 12257.60]  to LMG if you did not hire
[12257.60 --> 12257.82]  him?
[12257.88 --> 12259.28]  For example, no tech
[12259.28 --> 12259.54]  linked.
[12259.90 --> 12260.52]  Oh, I was trying to
[12260.52 --> 12261.34]  poach Riley from day
[12261.34 --> 12261.56]  zero.
[12262.06 --> 12262.42]  Yeah.
[12262.58 --> 12264.92]  So I created this one
[12264.92 --> 12265.68]  cause I was like, what?
[12266.30 --> 12267.10]  Oh no, heck no.
[12267.26 --> 12267.46]  Yeah.
[12267.62 --> 12268.80]  The only reason Riley
[12268.80 --> 12269.92]  didn't get poached was
[12269.92 --> 12271.36]  because I signed a no
[12271.36 --> 12272.06]  poaching clause.
[12272.18 --> 12272.44]  Yeah.
[12272.86 --> 12274.06]  So I knew that bit, but I
[12274.06 --> 12274.60]  didn't think there was
[12274.60 --> 12275.72]  anything else outside of
[12275.72 --> 12275.78]  that.
[12275.78 --> 12276.04]  Oh yeah.
[12276.74 --> 12277.58]  I would have had, I
[12277.58 --> 12278.28]  would have taken Riley
[12278.28 --> 12278.78]  day zero.
[12278.88 --> 12279.28]  He's great.
[12279.46 --> 12279.70]  Yeah.
[12279.88 --> 12280.28]  Love Riley.
[12280.28 --> 12285.50]  Good evening, LLD.
[12285.80 --> 12286.76]  Creative question.
[12287.36 --> 12288.28]  If you could have an
[12288.28 --> 12290.02]  experimental channel with
[12290.02 --> 12291.12]  content that doesn't do
[12291.12 --> 12292.26]  well on the main, what
[12292.26 --> 12294.18]  would content you would
[12294.18 --> 12294.74]  like to see?
[12295.10 --> 12296.50]  Oh, I would love to do
[12296.50 --> 12298.06]  like hardcore
[12298.06 --> 12298.82]  troubleshooting.
[12299.84 --> 12300.38]  Oh yeah.
[12300.42 --> 12300.96]  That'd be great.
[12301.00 --> 12301.70]  Just like this.
[12301.96 --> 12302.24]  Okay.
[12302.34 --> 12303.38]  My computer right now,
[12303.44 --> 12304.04]  Dan, have I shown you
[12304.04 --> 12304.40]  this yet?
[12304.48 --> 12304.82]  No.
[12305.00 --> 12305.90]  Give me some dopamine.
[12306.10 --> 12306.34]  Come on.
[12306.34 --> 12308.16]  On my computer, my, like
[12308.16 --> 12309.94]  my workstation, you
[12309.94 --> 12311.44]  cannot set up windows.
[12311.58 --> 12311.76]  Hello.
[12312.42 --> 12313.72]  It prompts you for a pin.
[12313.82 --> 12315.64]  You enter a pin and the
[12315.64 --> 12316.44]  window just goes away.
[12317.14 --> 12319.36]  You try to set up a camera
[12319.36 --> 12321.40]  ID or facial recognition
[12321.40 --> 12323.58]  and you go through the
[12323.58 --> 12324.70]  whole wizard and then it
[12324.70 --> 12326.04]  just, this is a desktop
[12326.04 --> 12326.60]  goes away.
[12326.66 --> 12326.78]  Yeah.
[12326.78 --> 12327.26]  It's my desktop.
[12327.40 --> 12328.48]  It has a Logitech camera.
[12328.54 --> 12329.02]  It supports it.
[12329.06 --> 12331.26]  You've worked before, but I
[12331.26 --> 12332.16]  have to type my password
[12332.16 --> 12333.14]  every time I log into my
[12333.14 --> 12333.42]  computer.
[12333.62 --> 12334.32]  It's ridiculous.
[12335.48 --> 12337.12]  I have tried taking off and
[12337.12 --> 12338.14]  re-adding my Microsoft
[12338.14 --> 12338.62]  account.
[12339.14 --> 12339.92]  No change.
[12340.74 --> 12341.28]  I don't get it.
[12341.68 --> 12342.42]  And it's one of those
[12342.42 --> 12345.76]  things where any problem
[12345.76 --> 12347.34]  that takes less than five
[12347.34 --> 12349.32]  seconds to solve once, you
[12349.32 --> 12350.96]  are never going to invest
[12350.96 --> 12352.56]  the five minutes that it
[12352.56 --> 12353.96]  takes to solve it once and
[12353.96 --> 12354.38]  for all.
[12354.86 --> 12355.98]  And so every time I sit down
[12355.98 --> 12357.42]  at my computer, I just
[12357.42 --> 12358.16]  type in my password.
[12358.44 --> 12359.20]  I'm like, I'll deal with
[12359.20 --> 12359.80]  this at some point.
[12360.08 --> 12361.50]  And then I just don't.
[12361.88 --> 12363.72]  I would love for that to be
[12363.72 --> 12365.02]  a whole channel because with
[12365.02 --> 12366.10]  the hundred plus people that
[12366.10 --> 12367.70]  we have here, we encounter
[12367.70 --> 12369.16]  sh** like that pretty much
[12369.16 --> 12369.74]  on the daily.
[12370.68 --> 12371.98]  Oh, I like working here
[12371.98 --> 12372.90]  because, you know, doing
[12372.90 --> 12375.18]  tech support, people don't
[12375.18 --> 12376.18]  bring me like, hey, my
[12376.18 --> 12377.18]  computer doesn't work and
[12377.18 --> 12377.86]  it's turned off.
[12378.04 --> 12379.98]  I only get asked when the
[12379.98 --> 12381.42]  problems are entertaining
[12381.42 --> 12383.72]  and weird and I've never
[12383.72 --> 12384.56]  seen them before.
[12384.92 --> 12386.36]  And all of the tech people
[12386.36 --> 12387.18]  here have never seen them
[12387.18 --> 12387.52]  before.
[12387.64 --> 12388.14]  It's great.
[12389.14 --> 12389.58]  Yeah.
[12390.02 --> 12390.46]  Yeah.
[12390.46 --> 12391.46]  What was I dealing with
[12391.46 --> 12391.92]  the other day?
[12392.32 --> 12395.20]  A Wi-Fi PCI card blew up
[12395.20 --> 12395.80]  in a laptop.
[12396.70 --> 12397.78]  The Wi-Fi doesn't work.
[12398.72 --> 12399.86]  Jake Danes is saying open
[12399.86 --> 12402.72]  up services.msc and enable
[12402.72 --> 12403.82]  biometric service.
[12404.68 --> 12406.22]  I can check, but I mean, I
[12406.22 --> 12407.24]  Googled a handful of things
[12407.24 --> 12408.64]  and tried things and they
[12408.64 --> 12409.28]  didn't work.
[12409.30 --> 12410.42]  So I just like left it
[12410.42 --> 12411.12]  because it takes five
[12411.12 --> 12411.80]  seconds to enter my
[12411.80 --> 12412.08]  password.
[12412.24 --> 12414.58]  So yes, yes, but also I'll
[12414.58 --> 12415.28]  get to it.
[12415.86 --> 12416.70]  But also no.
[12417.16 --> 12417.80]  Up next.
[12417.80 --> 12419.82]  Hey, DLL, a question for
[12419.82 --> 12420.66]  Linus, will you be
[12420.66 --> 12422.90]  upgrading your framework 13
[12422.90 --> 12424.10]  to a Ryzen board when
[12424.10 --> 12424.62]  they come out?
[12424.88 --> 12426.00]  I've had my eye on the
[12426.00 --> 12427.74]  16th model, 16 inch model,
[12428.24 --> 12429.10]  but I'm waiting for the
[12429.10 --> 12429.64]  reviews first.
[12429.76 --> 12431.04]  Yeah, being able to game
[12431.04 --> 12432.18]  would be awesome.
[12432.96 --> 12434.30]  And the Intel one, you
[12434.30 --> 12435.28]  know, you could play games
[12435.28 --> 12436.38]  or whatever, but the Ryzen
[12436.38 --> 12437.32]  one, it's going to be like,
[12437.54 --> 12439.90]  like you could actually play
[12439.90 --> 12440.56]  games on it.
[12440.96 --> 12441.76]  That's awesome.
[12442.40 --> 12443.34]  And then I don't even, I
[12443.34 --> 12444.54]  don't even need the eGPU.
[12444.94 --> 12446.06]  Like that's one advantage to
[12446.06 --> 12447.02]  the Intel one is you can
[12447.02 --> 12448.44]  plug into a Thunderbolt dock,
[12448.44 --> 12450.62]  but man, I don't need to
[12450.62 --> 12451.82]  play hardcore games on my
[12451.82 --> 12452.24]  laptop.
[12454.14 --> 12455.22]  Yeah, I'm super excited.
[12456.32 --> 12457.12]  Linus, what do you think
[12457.12 --> 12458.26]  about the Aya Neo
[12458.26 --> 12458.96]  Kun?
[12460.00 --> 12461.36]  Can't wait to try my new
[12461.36 --> 12461.74]  screwdriver.
[12463.40 --> 12463.94]  Aya Neo.
[12464.38 --> 12466.02]  I saw this thing.
[12466.16 --> 12467.34]  I remember not being
[12467.34 --> 12469.20]  particularly excited about it.
[12469.30 --> 12469.88]  Yeah, right.
[12469.92 --> 12471.20]  So it's got a gigantic
[12471.20 --> 12472.18]  screen on it.
[12473.06 --> 12474.40]  Touchpads, which is kind of
[12474.40 --> 12475.12]  nice for Windows
[12475.12 --> 12475.68]  navigation.
[12475.68 --> 12477.62]  I've been a little
[12477.62 --> 12478.92]  unimpressed with the
[12478.92 --> 12480.14]  ongoing development of
[12480.14 --> 12480.94]  their software.
[12481.66 --> 12483.66]  And as much as I give
[12483.66 --> 12487.58]  Asus a hard time, I have
[12487.58 --> 12489.04]  mostly found their overlay
[12489.04 --> 12490.08]  unobtrusive.
[12491.96 --> 12495.40]  So I'm pretty, I'm pretty
[12495.40 --> 12496.68]  happy with the Ally right
[12496.68 --> 12496.92]  now.
[12497.12 --> 12499.06]  The bigger screen is kind
[12499.06 --> 12500.00]  of cool, but I'm also
[12500.00 --> 12501.62]  finding the devices with the
[12501.62 --> 12503.18]  screen sizes that they have,
[12503.18 --> 12505.08]  like the Steam Deck and the
[12505.08 --> 12506.32]  Ally.
[12506.50 --> 12507.56]  I'm finding them heavy
[12507.56 --> 12508.30]  enough as it is.
[12508.36 --> 12509.52]  I'm not sure that I need
[12509.52 --> 12510.34]  them to be bigger and
[12510.34 --> 12510.58]  heavier.
[12511.84 --> 12513.20]  So I'm tepid.
[12513.44 --> 12514.16]  I'm tepid on it.
[12514.18 --> 12514.90]  Maybe I'll check it out on
[12514.90 --> 12515.60]  Short Circuit and it'll
[12515.60 --> 12516.34]  blow my mind.
[12516.50 --> 12517.40]  But for now, I'm pretty
[12517.40 --> 12517.72]  tepid.
[12518.84 --> 12519.96]  Why did you drop the
[12519.96 --> 12520.80]  Amazon store?
[12521.00 --> 12522.46]  Also, can we get a white
[12522.46 --> 12523.92]  stealth water bottle?
[12525.00 --> 12525.74]  Why did I drop the
[12525.74 --> 12526.26]  Amazon store?
[12526.26 --> 12526.86]  I don't think I dropped
[12526.86 --> 12527.52]  the Amazon store.
[12528.22 --> 12528.98]  Who curated this?
[12530.98 --> 12531.80]  Yeah, probably me.
[12531.80 --> 12534.76]  I just assume people are
[12534.76 --> 12535.62]  true, but we've had
[12535.62 --> 12536.96]  multiple people today and
[12536.96 --> 12539.02]  you're just like, no, it's
[12539.02 --> 12539.52]  just lies.
[12539.76 --> 12541.74]  Oh, oh, I suspect what
[12541.74 --> 12542.78]  they mean by dropped is
[12542.78 --> 12543.42]  like released.
[12545.16 --> 12546.70]  Oh, because we launched it
[12546.70 --> 12547.68]  a few weeks back, right?
[12547.90 --> 12548.14]  Sure.
[12548.30 --> 12548.54]  Yeah.
[12548.70 --> 12550.54]  People, people talk in real
[12550.54 --> 12550.86]  words.
[12551.28 --> 12551.54]  Yeah.
[12552.26 --> 12553.12]  I bet you that's what they
[12553.12 --> 12553.36]  mean.
[12554.96 --> 12556.02]  Well, oh.
[12559.64 --> 12560.12]  Okay.
[12560.12 --> 12560.20]  Okay.
[12560.84 --> 12561.06]  Yeah.
[12561.06 --> 12561.84]  We have it.
[12561.90 --> 12562.78]  I bet you what they mean
[12562.78 --> 12564.08]  is what made you release it?
[12564.14 --> 12564.86]  What made you start it?
[12564.98 --> 12565.68]  Oh, oh.
[12565.78 --> 12566.70]  Well, people asked us to.
[12567.24 --> 12568.28]  Like, we've got, we've had
[12568.28 --> 12569.28]  so many requests.
[12569.60 --> 12571.68]  Look at what percentage of
[12571.68 --> 12573.18]  the posts about the store
[12573.18 --> 12574.06]  complain about shipping.
[12575.36 --> 12576.72]  Like, okay, okay, fine.
[12576.76 --> 12577.58]  Then just buy it on Amazon.
[12577.82 --> 12578.76]  If, if that, if you want,
[12578.82 --> 12580.24]  like, if you want subsidized
[12580.24 --> 12581.66]  shipping, then, then buy it
[12581.66 --> 12582.00]  on Amazon.
[12582.14 --> 12583.36]  It's slightly more expensive
[12583.36 --> 12584.38]  and you have free shipping.
[12584.38 --> 12586.56]  By the way, this is not
[12586.56 --> 12586.76]  right.
[12586.80 --> 12587.36]  It's because I'm on the
[12587.36 --> 12588.10]  U.S. store.
[12588.20 --> 12589.32]  If you were on Amazon U.S.,
[12589.32 --> 12590.06]  it would be free shipping
[12590.06 --> 12590.44]  with Prime.
[12593.34 --> 12594.08]  Oh, it looks like it's
[12594.08 --> 12594.56]  selling, though.
[12594.64 --> 12595.90]  So that's, that's cool.
[12596.50 --> 12597.08]  How's the reviews?
[12597.94 --> 12599.44]  I just, I read Amazon
[12599.44 --> 12600.56]  reviews for fun sometimes.
[12601.12 --> 12602.44]  The ABCs of gaming reviews
[12602.44 --> 12603.56]  are all so wholesome.
[12603.68 --> 12604.50]  Where the hell are the
[12604.50 --> 12604.88]  reviews?
[12607.16 --> 12608.60]  Looks cheaper than it is,
[12608.80 --> 12609.92]  but is actually good.
[12610.28 --> 12611.48]  Hey, thanks, Petco.
[12612.24 --> 12613.06]  Worth the wait.
[12613.18 --> 12613.76]  Hey, thanks.
[12614.02 --> 12614.82]  What is, what is the
[12614.82 --> 12615.62]  one-star review?
[12616.32 --> 12617.36]  Let's see what the haters
[12617.36 --> 12617.94]  have to say.
[12618.02 --> 12618.78]  All right, sure, fine.
[12618.84 --> 12619.56]  Let's see what the haters
[12619.56 --> 12620.12]  have to say.
[12620.72 --> 12621.90]  Very poor hammer.
[12622.88 --> 12624.20]  I didn't have any screws
[12624.20 --> 12625.52]  about, so I tried driving
[12625.52 --> 12626.42]  a nail with it.
[12627.16 --> 12628.52]  Yeah, don't do that.
[12630.96 --> 12632.20]  Not made in Canada.
[12632.58 --> 12633.82]  Your driver is proudly
[12633.82 --> 12634.54]  designed, assembled,
[12634.68 --> 12635.60]  inspected, and packed by
[12635.60 --> 12636.74]  the Megapro family here in
[12636.74 --> 12637.80]  Canada and the USA.
[12639.04 --> 12639.90]  Okay, that's,
[12639.92 --> 12641.86]  not entirely correct,
[12641.94 --> 12643.62]  actually, but it is
[12643.62 --> 12644.12]  assembled.
[12644.30 --> 12645.52]  In other words, made in
[12645.52 --> 12646.60]  China with a made in USA
[12646.60 --> 12647.58]  price tag junk.
[12647.88 --> 12649.28]  You're very, very mistaken
[12649.28 --> 12650.26]  online shopper.
[12650.32 --> 12650.76]  You should probably
[12650.76 --> 12651.98]  practice online shopping
[12651.98 --> 12652.26]  more.
[12652.66 --> 12654.04]  We've been very transparent
[12654.04 --> 12655.56]  about the production of
[12655.56 --> 12656.62]  the screwdriver.
[12657.16 --> 12659.10]  It was designed and is
[12659.10 --> 12659.90]  manufactured in
[12659.90 --> 12660.96]  collaboration with
[12660.96 --> 12661.96]  Megapro along with
[12661.96 --> 12663.00]  PH Molds, which is
[12663.00 --> 12664.34]  located in either
[12664.34 --> 12665.16]  Maple Ridge or Pit
[12665.16 --> 12666.90]  Meadows, just across the
[12666.90 --> 12667.60]  river from here.
[12667.60 --> 12669.34]  The tooling was done by
[12669.34 --> 12670.16]  Innovation Tool and
[12670.16 --> 12671.02]  Dye, which is in
[12671.02 --> 12672.08]  Richmond, British Columbia.
[12672.30 --> 12674.04]  So that's also here in
[12674.04 --> 12674.36]  Canada.
[12674.62 --> 12676.38]  The ratchets and the
[12676.38 --> 12678.90]  shafts are built and
[12678.90 --> 12681.36]  turned in China, and then
[12681.36 --> 12682.80]  we send them plastics that
[12682.80 --> 12684.18]  they assemble into like a
[12684.18 --> 12685.30]  ratchet selector ring
[12685.30 --> 12685.66]  assembly.
[12685.92 --> 12687.40]  They ship that back to us
[12687.40 --> 12688.24]  where the plastics are
[12688.24 --> 12689.84]  shot, and final assembly in
[12689.84 --> 12691.60]  QC is done here in Canada.
[12691.60 --> 12695.66]  So it's a global product.
[12696.86 --> 12698.04]  That's how it works.
[12698.88 --> 12701.04]  But it is largely designed
[12701.04 --> 12702.58]  and even, yes, manufactured
[12702.58 --> 12704.20]  and assembled in Canada.
[12705.56 --> 12707.42]  We haven't applied for any
[12707.42 --> 12708.92]  kind of like made in Canada
[12708.92 --> 12710.80]  like sticker or anything like
[12710.80 --> 12711.10]  that.
[12711.42 --> 12712.68]  Last time we looked into it,
[12712.70 --> 12714.48]  it looked time-consuming and
[12714.48 --> 12716.20]  complicated, so we didn't
[12716.20 --> 12717.02]  really bother with that.
[12717.26 --> 12718.86]  So I find it's easier rather
[12718.86 --> 12720.14]  than simplify everything down
[12720.14 --> 12721.26]  to a little badge or a logo
[12721.26 --> 12723.04]  to just explain the whole
[12723.04 --> 12724.00]  story.
[12725.92 --> 12728.24]  Hey, LLD, did you guys hear
[12728.24 --> 12730.20]  about the large deposit of
[12730.20 --> 12731.28]  lithium they found a few
[12731.28 --> 12731.70]  days ago?
[12732.14 --> 12733.90]  Will we see lithium-related
[12733.90 --> 12735.28]  products getting more
[12735.28 --> 12736.44]  affordable in the near
[12736.44 --> 12736.76]  future?
[12737.30 --> 12739.42]  For example, EVs getting
[12739.42 --> 12739.74]  cheaper.
[12740.76 --> 12741.20]  Unlikely.
[12741.34 --> 12742.64]  I mean, you're going to...
[12742.64 --> 12742.84]  I don't see that
[12742.84 --> 12743.52]  happening, to be honest.
[12743.60 --> 12745.76]  Yeah, it's going to be...
[12745.76 --> 12746.40]  Rare metals.
[12746.84 --> 12748.52]  And it's going to take ages
[12748.52 --> 12750.04]  to get the extraction up to
[12750.04 --> 12750.40]  speed.
[12750.88 --> 12751.78]  There's going to be a whole
[12751.78 --> 12752.80]  regulatory whatever.
[12753.06 --> 12753.84]  There's going to be a gigantic
[12753.84 --> 12754.84]  investment into it.
[12754.90 --> 12755.48]  They're going to expect
[12755.48 --> 12756.28]  something back for their
[12756.28 --> 12756.62]  investment.
[12756.78 --> 12757.36]  I mean, at the end of the
[12757.36 --> 12758.90]  day, it's a commodity
[12758.90 --> 12759.66]  product, right?
[12759.72 --> 12760.94]  So the pricing is going to be
[12760.94 --> 12762.30]  dictated by supply and demand,
[12762.36 --> 12762.94]  like you say.
[12763.36 --> 12764.86]  But it's in the interest of
[12764.86 --> 12767.22]  every supplier to balance the
[12767.22 --> 12768.54]  supply and demand so that the
[12768.54 --> 12769.66]  pricing doesn't crash, because
[12769.66 --> 12771.86]  otherwise you get the DRAM
[12771.86 --> 12772.88]  industry right now.
[12773.30 --> 12774.42]  Have you seen how freaking
[12774.42 --> 12775.42]  cheap RAM is?
[12776.00 --> 12777.38]  It's weird because we had
[12777.38 --> 12779.68]  years of RAM being absurdly
[12779.68 --> 12780.12]  expensive.
[12780.38 --> 12781.18]  Wasn't there a flood?
[12781.70 --> 12782.50]  Multiple floods?
[12782.66 --> 12783.38]  Long time ago.
[12783.40 --> 12783.68]  Yeah.
[12783.80 --> 12785.12]  And I'm pretty sure it's a
[12785.12 --> 12786.26]  big knock-on effect for a
[12786.26 --> 12786.74]  long time, maybe.
[12787.06 --> 12788.10]  We were working on a video
[12788.10 --> 12790.58]  today that is the final
[12790.58 --> 12792.06]  rollout of the land center.
[12792.06 --> 12793.58]  So we were building five
[12793.58 --> 12794.08]  machines.
[12794.84 --> 12796.06]  And, you know, it's...
[12796.92 --> 12797.70]  When you're building five
[12797.70 --> 12798.38]  machines, it's...
[12798.38 --> 12799.18]  Land center as in...
[12799.18 --> 12801.12]  Yeah, at my house for my
[12801.12 --> 12801.36]  kids.
[12802.48 --> 12803.42]  It's actually sweet.
[12803.54 --> 12804.30]  Yeah, it's actually pretty
[12804.30 --> 12804.50]  cool.
[12804.62 --> 12805.00]  It's really cool.
[12805.00 --> 12805.88]  I would have given anything
[12805.88 --> 12806.84]  for that when I was a kid.
[12807.04 --> 12807.28]  Yeah.
[12807.40 --> 12808.24]  That's, like...
[12808.24 --> 12810.02]  So many of the things I do is
[12810.02 --> 12811.14]  just, like, stuff I would have
[12811.14 --> 12811.88]  liked when I was a kid.
[12812.18 --> 12813.08]  Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[12813.16 --> 12814.62]  The point is, we were working
[12814.62 --> 12816.92]  on them, and it's not as
[12816.92 --> 12817.72]  simple when you're just, like,
[12817.76 --> 12818.76]  building five machines for
[12818.76 --> 12819.90]  personal use as just, you
[12819.90 --> 12820.70]  know, calling up companies
[12820.70 --> 12821.62]  being like, hey, can you send
[12821.62 --> 12821.88]  stuff?
[12822.26 --> 12823.62]  So, you know, we bought
[12823.62 --> 12825.78]  processors, bought GPUs.
[12826.10 --> 12827.14]  So I was looking at a lot of the
[12827.14 --> 12828.18]  pricing for this stuff.
[12828.80 --> 12831.62]  And the kits of RAM that we
[12831.62 --> 12836.28]  used are 32 gig, 6,000 CL30
[12836.28 --> 12838.24]  from G-Skill, okay?
[12838.60 --> 12839.78]  And if I had to guess what
[12839.78 --> 12840.88]  pricing for something like
[12840.88 --> 12842.66]  that would be, you know, my
[12842.66 --> 12843.88]  out-of-date brain, obviously
[12843.88 --> 12844.52]  I've looked at it more
[12844.52 --> 12845.56]  recently than this, but if I
[12845.56 --> 12846.70]  didn't look at it that often,
[12846.70 --> 12848.08]  I could easily believe that
[12848.08 --> 12848.78]  something like that is, like,
[12848.80 --> 12850.10]  250, 300 bucks.
[12850.50 --> 12850.86]  Nope.
[12851.70 --> 12852.00]  Nope.
[12852.12 --> 12855.78]  That'll be under 100 US
[12855.78 --> 12856.20]  dollars.
[12856.80 --> 12857.28]  That's pretty wild.
[12857.48 --> 12858.32]  This is the kit, I believe.
[12858.50 --> 12859.42]  For 32 gigs?
[12859.42 --> 12862.28]  For 32 gigs of 6,000, like,
[12862.28 --> 12863.52]  CL30!
[12864.12 --> 12866.08]  This is not crap RAM, this is,
[12866.18 --> 12867.20]  like, good stuff.
[12867.26 --> 12869.60]  My DDR4 was, like, 500 bucks.
[12869.62 --> 12870.58]  I know, right?
[12870.72 --> 12871.78]  DDR4 was brutal.
[12871.88 --> 12872.20]  Ugh.
[12873.80 --> 12874.14]  Yeah.
[12875.86 --> 12877.68]  Even some of the 3 era was
[12877.68 --> 12878.52]  pretty bad, wasn't it?
[12878.52 --> 12878.60]  Yeah!
[12878.74 --> 12879.88]  Yes, it was, right at the
[12879.88 --> 12880.16]  beginning.
[12880.28 --> 12882.12]  Remember the OCZ SLI certified?
[12882.72 --> 12884.34]  Oh my god, I had so many
[12884.34 --> 12885.24]  sticks of that die.
[12885.38 --> 12886.12]  You've talked about that
[12886.12 --> 12886.44]  before.
[12886.50 --> 12887.46]  That stuff was crap!
[12887.56 --> 12888.46]  Oh my god.
[12888.66 --> 12889.02]  Yeah.
[12890.42 --> 12891.58]  Okay, last one of my
[12891.58 --> 12892.44]  curated, if you want.
[12893.28 --> 12893.88]  Let's see.
[12894.06 --> 12895.82]  Glad I got to caught it live.
[12896.24 --> 12897.78]  I usually listen to it as a
[12897.78 --> 12898.30]  podcast.
[12898.74 --> 12900.08]  Linus, with your new role as
[12900.08 --> 12901.60]  CVO, did that idea come
[12901.60 --> 12903.02]  organically, or was that
[12903.02 --> 12905.04]  borrowed from Simon Sinek's
[12905.04 --> 12905.92]  leadership books?
[12906.02 --> 12906.86]  I have never heard of
[12906.86 --> 12909.36]  Simon Sinek, and I had never
[12909.36 --> 12910.56]  heard of Chief Vision Officer
[12910.56 --> 12911.38]  being a real thing.
[12911.42 --> 12912.48]  I just thought it sounded kind
[12912.48 --> 12912.88]  of funny.
[12913.60 --> 12915.66]  And seemed to encompass what
[12915.66 --> 12916.84]  my job is supposed to be,
[12916.84 --> 12918.08]  because we had some concern
[12918.08 --> 12919.76]  expressed internally that all
[12919.76 --> 12921.84]  of a sudden our marching
[12921.84 --> 12923.20]  orders were going to come from
[12923.20 --> 12924.42]  someone corporate.
[12925.10 --> 12926.72]  Because that's part of how we
[12926.72 --> 12928.44]  sold Taron internally, was that
[12928.44 --> 12929.46]  he was going to bring more
[12929.46 --> 12931.06]  structure at a time when
[12931.06 --> 12932.44]  obviously we needed it.
[12932.44 --> 12932.68]  Right?
[12932.68 --> 12936.14]  And so I kind of went, okay,
[12936.18 --> 12937.02]  well, hold on a second.
[12937.32 --> 12940.42]  We need a role that makes it
[12940.42 --> 12942.66]  clear that, you know, we're
[12942.66 --> 12944.46]  still going to make these
[12944.46 --> 12946.60]  moonshot investments.
[12946.60 --> 12948.14]  We're still going to just do
[12948.14 --> 12949.60]  things based on our gut because
[12949.60 --> 12950.66]  it's what we think is right.
[12951.20 --> 12953.04]  And so that's where Vision
[12953.04 --> 12954.34]  Officer came from.
[12954.38 --> 12955.40]  I had a vision, and that was
[12955.40 --> 12956.38]  the title, you know, whatever.
[12956.38 --> 12959.36]  We meme about it a lot
[12959.36 --> 12960.62]  internally.
[12962.20 --> 12964.30]  Seriously, everyone from...
[12964.30 --> 12965.26]  I do it all the time.
[12965.36 --> 12966.44]  I call him eyeball officer.
[12966.78 --> 12970.06]  During executive, during like
[12970.06 --> 12971.88]  all exec, like all management
[12971.88 --> 12972.72]  meetings, people are
[12972.72 --> 12973.68]  constantly memeing on it.
[12974.20 --> 12975.54]  Taron himself rips you for
[12975.54 --> 12976.32]  that in the executive
[12976.32 --> 12977.48]  meetings all the time.
[12978.38 --> 12982.82]  Oh, man.
[12983.16 --> 12984.74]  Sorry, I find that very
[12984.74 --> 12985.56]  funny, personally.
[12985.56 --> 12987.16]  And I've also got people who
[12987.16 --> 12988.32]  have been on staff for like
[12988.32 --> 12989.66]  less than six months just
[12989.66 --> 12990.84]  like poking fun at me about
[12990.84 --> 12991.04]  it.
[12992.16 --> 12993.84]  My point is that everyone
[12993.84 --> 12995.74]  from the most senior to the
[12995.74 --> 12997.72]  most junior is having a go at
[12997.72 --> 12998.90]  me for chief vision officer.
[12999.10 --> 13001.88]  But the reality of it is, I
[13001.88 --> 13003.40]  think it's a pretty good, I
[13003.40 --> 13004.16]  think it's a pretty good
[13004.16 --> 13005.50]  descriptor of what the heck it
[13005.50 --> 13006.50]  is exactly that I'm supposed
[13006.50 --> 13006.96]  to be doing.
[13007.06 --> 13008.22]  So we're sticking with it.
[13008.26 --> 13009.10]  It's also really funny.
[13009.34 --> 13009.56]  Yeah.
[13011.36 --> 13013.88]  With the framework 16 coming
[13013.88 --> 13014.80]  out soon, are you
[13014.80 --> 13016.22]  considering getting a bulk
[13016.22 --> 13017.64]  order and using them for
[13017.64 --> 13019.04]  office or personal use?
[13019.34 --> 13021.08]  I have the framework 13, but
[13021.08 --> 13022.44]  I'm loving the idea of the
[13022.44 --> 13022.86]  16.
[13023.04 --> 13024.12]  I'm almost certainly going to
[13024.12 --> 13024.82]  stick with the 13.
[13024.94 --> 13025.96]  I just don't think I'm going
[13025.96 --> 13027.10]  back to anything other than a
[13027.10 --> 13027.54]  thin and light.
[13027.62 --> 13028.72]  Once I made the move, I was
[13028.72 --> 13029.00]  done.
[13029.06 --> 13029.52]  I was hooked.
[13029.52 --> 13032.14]  I carry around my laptop a lot
[13032.14 --> 13033.40]  and carrying around a bigger
[13033.40 --> 13035.64]  laptop than what I'm going to
[13035.64 --> 13037.70]  need 99% of the time with more
[13037.70 --> 13039.32]  performance than I need 99% of
[13039.32 --> 13039.56]  the time.
[13039.62 --> 13041.66]  It's just, I don't need that for
[13041.66 --> 13042.00]  my back.
[13042.18 --> 13043.74]  It would work if it had a handle.
[13044.70 --> 13046.50]  I mean, my backpack has a handle.
[13046.70 --> 13048.34]  No, he has a Toughbook that has a
[13048.34 --> 13048.88]  handle on it.
[13049.14 --> 13050.16]  My laptop has a handle.
[13050.16 --> 13050.24]  Okay.
[13050.40 --> 13051.40]  Well, thank you, Dan.
[13051.48 --> 13051.94]  That's really helpful.
[13051.94 --> 13052.98]  How'd you end up with that, Dan?
[13053.64 --> 13054.66]  It got hit with a shovel.
[13054.84 --> 13055.12]  Uh-huh.
[13055.78 --> 13056.18]  Uh-huh.
[13056.18 --> 13056.74]  It did.
[13056.94 --> 13057.22]  Uh-huh.
[13057.30 --> 13058.20]  That's not how you ended up
[13058.20 --> 13058.98]  with it, but sure.
[13059.02 --> 13059.88]  Did he just take it?
[13060.14 --> 13060.48]  What do you mean?
[13060.98 --> 13062.16]  Is it kind of like what he did
[13062.16 --> 13063.40]  with the stupid Odyssey arc
[13063.40 --> 13064.28]  where he just took it?
[13064.28 --> 13065.14]  It's exactly what happened.
[13065.14 --> 13066.70]  No, this is my work laptop.
[13068.24 --> 13069.48]  Adam has the Odyssey arc.
[13069.60 --> 13069.78]  Done.
[13069.90 --> 13070.10]  Done.
[13070.14 --> 13070.44]  You're out.
[13072.04 --> 13073.60]  Yeah, you had it for a bit.
[13074.28 --> 13075.90]  You only relinquished it because
[13075.90 --> 13077.42]  Adam needed it for a video.
[13077.86 --> 13079.10]  Don't think I don't know this
[13079.10 --> 13079.48]  story.
[13079.60 --> 13081.08]  I get my stuff and if people are
[13081.08 --> 13081.96]  like, hey, we need this back,
[13082.02 --> 13082.94]  they can have it back immediately.
[13083.38 --> 13084.12]  Not a problem.
[13084.12 --> 13086.22]  I come into knowing that.
[13086.54 --> 13087.80]  It's like you crotch some cheese
[13087.80 --> 13088.98]  at the grocery store and you're
[13088.98 --> 13090.34]  just like, yeah, I mean, as soon
[13090.34 --> 13091.26]  as they come and tell me they
[13091.26 --> 13091.52]  need it, I give it back.
[13091.52 --> 13092.54]  Yeah, if the security guard
[13092.54 --> 13094.26]  wants it back, you can have my
[13094.26 --> 13094.88]  crotch cheese.
[13098.18 --> 13099.64]  Anywho, what were we talking
[13099.64 --> 13100.20]  about just now?
[13100.22 --> 13100.88]  What was the question?
[13101.44 --> 13102.66]  Uh, you're going to get the 16
[13102.66 --> 13103.50]  or are you okay with the 13?
[13103.54 --> 13104.20]  Oh, yeah, right.
[13104.20 --> 13106.54]  So, I wanted to make it really
[13106.54 --> 13108.16]  clear to people internally that I
[13108.16 --> 13109.50]  don't want my position as an
[13109.50 --> 13111.44]  investor and framework to affect
[13111.44 --> 13113.18]  our purchasing decisions as Linus
[13113.18 --> 13113.98]  Media Group, the company,
[13113.98 --> 13115.16]  because Linus Media Group's not
[13115.16 --> 13115.62]  an investor.
[13116.70 --> 13116.78]  Yeah.
[13116.78 --> 13116.96]  Right?
[13117.08 --> 13118.94]  Like, so while, yes, the primary
[13118.94 --> 13120.46]  investor of Linus Media Group is
[13120.46 --> 13121.56]  me, who's also an investor in
[13121.56 --> 13121.88]  blah, blah, blah.
[13122.00 --> 13123.38]  The point is that I don't want to
[13123.38 --> 13124.68]  step on people's ability to do
[13124.68 --> 13125.16]  their job.
[13125.24 --> 13127.28]  So, I raised it as a possibility
[13127.28 --> 13129.46]  to, I think, Colton was working
[13129.46 --> 13130.70]  on our, like, standardized
[13130.70 --> 13131.16]  products.
[13131.20 --> 13133.42]  But I think that's in your lap
[13133.42 --> 13133.76]  right now.
[13133.76 --> 13134.38]  It's like a mixed.
[13134.68 --> 13134.90]  Yeah.
[13134.90 --> 13134.94]  Yeah.
[13135.20 --> 13137.74]  So, I have said, hey, I would
[13137.74 --> 13139.38]  personally appreciate if you guys
[13139.38 --> 13141.70]  at least looked at it because
[13141.70 --> 13142.66]  Framework's a small company.
[13142.76 --> 13144.48]  They might not normally end up on
[13144.48 --> 13146.72]  the radar of someone who's making a
[13146.72 --> 13147.42]  purchasing decision.
[13147.90 --> 13149.98]  But, and I made this very clear, and
[13149.98 --> 13151.20]  I think Luke can vouch for me here,
[13151.84 --> 13154.52]  I said, if it's not the best, if it's
[13154.52 --> 13157.18]  not the best option, don't buy it.
[13157.18 --> 13159.58]  I don't think we're fully decided
[13159.58 --> 13160.60]  on laptops yet.
[13160.98 --> 13162.02]  I don't know how much of this I
[13162.02 --> 13163.14]  should even necessarily say, but I
[13163.14 --> 13164.14]  don't think we're fully decided on
[13164.14 --> 13164.74]  laptops yet.
[13165.02 --> 13168.90]  I proposed Dell XPSs because we've
[13168.90 --> 13171.12]  had, we've had very good success
[13171.12 --> 13172.40]  with them being reliable in the
[13172.40 --> 13172.78]  past.
[13173.38 --> 13175.08]  And what we mostly need are, like,
[13175.14 --> 13176.44]  reliable business laptops.
[13176.74 --> 13177.28]  They're really heavy.
[13177.30 --> 13179.68]  We have some use cases for, like,
[13179.96 --> 13182.06]  editors on the road and stuff where
[13182.06 --> 13183.62]  we need laptops that have, like,
[13183.86 --> 13185.64]  really good GPU power.
[13187.18 --> 13188.70]  But, yeah, I've always found very
[13188.70 --> 13190.18]  high reliability in XPSs.
[13190.28 --> 13191.42]  And then we looked into the pricing,
[13191.42 --> 13193.32]  and it's really not that much
[13193.32 --> 13194.80]  different from a framework anyways.
[13196.96 --> 13197.96]  So, I don't know.
[13198.06 --> 13199.36]  That's still up in the air a little
[13199.36 --> 13199.50]  bit.
[13199.66 --> 13200.90]  XPSs you can get with touchscreens,
[13201.02 --> 13201.26]  though.
[13202.24 --> 13204.80]  And it's like, I had an interaction
[13204.80 --> 13208.06]  with someone recently where, was it
[13208.06 --> 13208.42]  Yvonne?
[13208.72 --> 13209.40]  Might have been Yvonne.
[13209.52 --> 13209.96]  It was someone.
[13211.18 --> 13213.56]  Was using a Mac and doesn't often
[13213.56 --> 13214.06]  use a Mac.
[13214.10 --> 13215.26]  And they just, like, went to scroll a
[13215.26 --> 13216.40]  page and were like, how does this not
[13216.40 --> 13216.86]  have a touchscreen?
[13216.86 --> 13217.54]  What year is it?
[13218.94 --> 13219.64]  I don't know.
[13219.74 --> 13220.48]  Ask Tim Apple.
[13220.64 --> 13221.84]  I do that all the time.
[13221.90 --> 13223.56]  I'm really not a laptop person.
[13223.70 --> 13224.98]  So, I've been trying to, like, get
[13224.98 --> 13226.62]  other people's input on the laptop
[13226.62 --> 13227.40]  side of things.
[13227.52 --> 13227.74]  Yeah.
[13228.26 --> 13229.82]  It was just, it was really funny to
[13229.82 --> 13231.12]  me because it's one of those things
[13231.12 --> 13233.24]  where I hear the arguments against
[13233.24 --> 13234.24]  touchscreen in a laptop.
[13234.24 --> 13235.30]  And I get it.
[13235.42 --> 13236.70]  You don't want fingerprints all over
[13236.70 --> 13237.04]  your screen.
[13237.14 --> 13238.84]  Oh, the touchpad is, the touchpad is
[13238.84 --> 13239.10]  great.
[13239.24 --> 13240.22]  And it's like, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[13240.28 --> 13240.40]  blah.
[13240.46 --> 13241.38]  And it's like, yeah, sure, fine.
[13241.38 --> 13244.06]  But, like, on those occasions when
[13244.06 --> 13248.50]  you're just like, it's there.
[13248.62 --> 13249.12]  It's an option.
[13249.60 --> 13250.50]  It's really nice to have.
[13250.62 --> 13252.18]  Obviously, I don't daily drive one
[13252.18 --> 13253.42]  with a touchscreen right now because
[13253.42 --> 13254.44]  I'm daily driving a framework.
[13254.58 --> 13255.54]  And, yeah, I miss it sometimes.
[13255.54 --> 13257.44]  My laptop has touchscreen.
[13258.06 --> 13260.24]  And it always just, like, surprises me.
[13261.44 --> 13261.72]  Okay.
[13261.82 --> 13262.44]  Because I won't.
[13262.52 --> 13263.68]  But someone else will poke my screen
[13263.68 --> 13264.42]  and then it will scroll.
[13264.54 --> 13266.18]  And I'll go like, oh, yeah, it has that.
[13266.36 --> 13267.78]  And then I'll never use it again.
[13268.16 --> 13269.56]  Because I don't really like it.
[13269.64 --> 13270.70]  But, I don't know.
[13270.96 --> 13271.46]  It doesn't matter.
[13272.14 --> 13272.94]  Other people might.
[13273.18 --> 13273.78]  And that's okay.
[13275.08 --> 13276.24]  Hey, LDL.
[13276.32 --> 13278.08]  Are you still considering making a video
[13278.08 --> 13280.78]  about VTubers and or 3D tracking tech?
[13280.88 --> 13282.50]  Yes, we still want to do that collab.
[13283.04 --> 13284.74]  No, I haven't moved it forward.
[13284.74 --> 13285.38]  And I'm sorry.
[13285.54 --> 13288.44]  And I'm sorry,
[13288.56 --> 13289.92]  but I think that's the end of the WAN show.
[13290.12 --> 13291.16]  We'll see you again next week.
[13291.22 --> 13292.18]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[13292.68 --> 13293.04]  Bye!
[13293.04 --> 13313.82]  Das
[13317.60 --> 13318.20]  Yeah, super church!
[13318.20 --> 13320.68]  All right.
