[0.36 --> 6.80]  What is up everybody and welcome to the WAN show! Honestly, it's not really that big of a story, but it is absolutely hilarious.
[7.34 --> 9.34]  Elon Musk told his...
[9.34 --> 13.92]  told his sponsors to go f*** themselves.
[15.58 --> 16.84]  That's one way to get him back.
[17.04 --> 18.22]  Yeah, I mean...
[18.22 --> 19.30]  You gotta play hard to get.
[19.70 --> 21.78]  Yeah, yeah, I tried that with my ex.
[22.74 --> 25.26]  No, that I called her ex. No, actually, I never tried that.
[25.30 --> 28.44]  Anyway, it was a great title, so what are you gonna do?
[28.44 --> 30.44]  In other news...
[30.44 --> 32.44]  Dbrand!
[32.44 --> 35.66]  There's a Dbrand and Casetify update.
[35.66 --> 38.10]  Oh, yeah, right. I remember how I was gonna segway between them.
[38.10 --> 40.10]  I was gonna be like, speaking of our sponsors and you...
[40.10 --> 42.10]  Go f*** yourself. Dbrand!
[42.10 --> 45.20]  Anyway, we're gonna give you guys the update on what's going on with Casetify.
[45.20 --> 47.48]  Don't worry, we still love Dbrand. What else we got going on here?
[48.04 --> 50.04]  Uhhhhhh...
[51.16 --> 52.36]  I'm not prepared at all.
[53.00 --> 54.08]  You had so much time.
[54.08 --> 57.50]  I honestly did. I had an incredible amount of time.
[57.50 --> 59.50]  I'm so late today.
[59.50 --> 61.50]  You didn't even look at the dog.
[61.50 --> 63.50]  And you didn't even take a topic that I wanted to shout out.
[63.50 --> 64.50]  It's remarkable.
[64.50 --> 67.50]  I'll just take a drink of water.
[67.50 --> 71.50]  Um, there was a... there was a tech conference that had fake...
[71.50 --> 73.50]  uh... female speakers.
[73.50 --> 74.50]  Oh, no.
[74.50 --> 76.50]  Yeah, that was almost the title of the video today,
[76.50 --> 80.50]  but Luke was afraid that people would just see the title and we would get cancelled again.
[80.50 --> 81.50]  Yeah, so...
[81.50 --> 83.50]  I thought it was a great title.
[83.50 --> 86.50]  It was like, fake women are a problem in tech.
[86.50 --> 87.50]  Yeah.
[87.50 --> 89.50]  Yeah, but it's... but people would have clicked it.
[89.50 --> 91.50]  They sure would have.
[91.50 --> 93.50]  They would have clicked it, but no, no, it's that they were actually fake.
[93.50 --> 94.50]  Yes.
[94.50 --> 95.50]  Fabricated.
[95.50 --> 96.50]  Yeah.
[96.50 --> 97.50]  Made up.
[97.50 --> 98.50]  They were lied about.
[98.50 --> 99.50]  That because it's terrible.
[99.50 --> 100.50]  Yeah.
[100.50 --> 101.50]  It's actually really lame.
[101.50 --> 102.50]  Like, yeah.
[102.50 --> 103.50]  So, we'll...
[103.50 --> 104.50]  Yeah, we'll...
[104.50 --> 105.50]  Yeah.
[105.50 --> 107.50]  But we won't talk about that with that as the title.
[107.50 --> 108.50]  Okay?
[108.50 --> 109.50]  Yes.
[109.50 --> 110.50]  Yeah.
[110.50 --> 111.50]  Um...
[111.50 --> 112.50]  Okay, what...
[112.50 --> 113.50]  What is this?
[113.50 --> 115.50]  Viewer-sent metal screwdriver and mining backpack?
[115.50 --> 116.50]  Oh!
[116.50 --> 117.50]  That one!
[117.50 --> 119.50]  That must be why Tynan's here.
[119.50 --> 120.50]  Oh!
[120.50 --> 121.50]  Alright, let's roll that intro!
[121.50 --> 123.50]  Oh, that's sick.
[123.50 --> 145.50]  I bet that sponsors never watch this part, so go f*** yourself MSI.
[145.50 --> 148.50]  Just kidding, just kidding, just kidding.
[148.50 --> 150.50]  Who are all the sponsors?
[150.50 --> 153.50]  Backblaze and...
[153.50 --> 154.50]  Oh, really?
[154.50 --> 155.50]  Manscaped?
[155.50 --> 156.50]  Hey, alright, cool.
[156.50 --> 157.50]  That's great.
[157.50 --> 159.50]  So, I don't hear the bleep on my end.
[159.50 --> 164.50]  So, for just a fraction of a moment, I'm just...
[164.50 --> 165.50]  Gah!
[165.50 --> 166.50]  Yeah, that's great.
[166.50 --> 168.50]  Alright, why don't we jump into...
[168.50 --> 171.50]  Not really that big of a topic, but let's get it out of the way.
[171.50 --> 179.50]  Earlier this week, following major advertisers leaving the ex-formerly Twitter platform due to
[179.50 --> 186.50]  Musk endorsing a tweet that, honestly, I am not even going to repeat.
[186.50 --> 194.50]  Musk did a video interview with the New York Times where he was briefly contrite, calling it perhaps one of his worst posts,
[194.50 --> 196.50]  then declared,
[196.50 --> 197.50]  Don't advertise.
[197.50 --> 205.50]  If someone's going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f*** yourself.
[205.50 --> 209.50]  The f*** was repeated several times.
[209.50 --> 211.50]  So, are they in a relationship now?
[211.50 --> 212.50]  I'm sorry.
[212.50 --> 216.50]  Including, at one point,
[216.50 --> 221.50]  Hey Bob, an apparent reference to Disney's Bob Iger, quote,
[221.50 --> 230.50]  What this advertising boycott is going to do is, it is going to kill the company, and the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company.
[230.50 --> 238.50]  CEO Linda Iaccarino was apparently sitting stone-faced in the front row for the interview.
[238.50 --> 242.50]  CEO Linda Iaccarino
[242.50 --> 261.50]  Wow, let me tell you, as someone who has gone through some stuff, you know, after bringing someone on to help me in a leadership role, quite recently, I don't think this is how you do it.
[261.50 --> 263.50]  CEO Linda Iaccarino
[263.50 --> 265.50]  I don't think you're giving Ms. Iaccarino
[265.50 --> 267.50]  A lot of options, a lot of ammo.
[267.50 --> 273.50]  Well, I was going to say, I don't think you're exactly tossing her a layup, but it's more like, I don't think you're even giving her a ball.
[273.50 --> 275.50]  You, like, kicked it out of the stadium.
[275.50 --> 276.50]  Go get it.
[276.50 --> 279.50]  And then, while she was gone, you burned it to the ground.
[280.50 --> 287.50]  And, no, I don't think that the majority of people are going to blame Disney for the downfall of Twitter.
[287.50 --> 292.50]  I mean, even the people who love Twitter love that it is a flaming pile of absolute garbage.
[292.50 --> 297.50]  It is a f***ing dumpster fire and it can go f*** itself, I think is sort of the mentality.
[297.50 --> 305.50]  I think that while there are absolutely things that are valuable about Twitter, like, I haven't found a replacement, for example,
[305.50 --> 306.50]  creator messaging?
[306.50 --> 308.50]  For how to, no, I wasn't even going to say that.
[308.50 --> 310.50]  We've talked about that in the past.
[310.50 --> 316.50]  But I haven't found a replacement for staying up to date on my, like, juicy creator scandals.
[316.50 --> 320.50]  And, for me, that's not just a guilty pleasure.
[320.50 --> 322.50]  There's definitely a little bit of it.
[322.50 --> 329.50]  But, it's also just being in tune with what the heck is going on in my industry.
[329.50 --> 332.50]  Like, I should probably have some idea, you know.
[332.50 --> 336.50]  I feel like there's gotta be an option, like, live stream fails or...
[336.50 --> 340.50]  I don't know, you can, like, go to Dixerto or something like that.
[340.50 --> 341.50]  Like, they...
[341.50 --> 342.50]  Well, that's what I'm talking about!
[342.50 --> 343.50]  That's what I'm talking about!
[343.50 --> 344.50]  You're not gonna go to live stream fails!
[344.50 --> 345.50]  That's not gonna have everything there.
[345.50 --> 346.50]  Yeah, I don't do that.
[346.50 --> 347.50]  That's fair enough.
[347.50 --> 348.50]  Yeah, exactly!
[348.50 --> 351.50]  So, I mean, come on, guys, let me know.
[351.50 --> 353.50]  Like, is there a viable alternative?
[353.50 --> 354.50]  Exactly!
[354.50 --> 359.50]  Because it's tailored enough for me at this point that it knows that I'm probably gonna
[359.50 --> 367.50]  click on, you know, someone who is under fire for selling $8 cookies or whatever else.
[367.50 --> 371.50]  Which, to be clear, I think some people kind of misinterpreted what I said about that.
[371.50 --> 374.50]  I am not taking a stance on that.
[374.50 --> 379.50]  I have not done any research into the whole, like, Pokimane cookies thing, which I think
[379.50 --> 381.50]  is mostly blown over at this point, but I...
[381.50 --> 383.50]  Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna lose yours anymore.
[383.50 --> 387.50]  It seemed like some people thought that I was, like, taking a side in this.
[387.50 --> 389.50]  I've never tried the cookies.
[389.50 --> 393.50]  I've never tried the cookies that they are allegedly very similar to.
[393.50 --> 394.50]  I...
[394.50 --> 395.50]  I...
[395.50 --> 397.50]  They're cookies, guys.
[397.50 --> 402.50]  I have a lot of questions about buying cookies online in general.
[402.50 --> 403.50]  Yeah!
[403.50 --> 405.50]  That's sort of...
[405.50 --> 408.50]  Why are you shopping for cookies on the internet?
[408.50 --> 410.50]  I didn't even make it all the way to...
[410.50 --> 413.50]  The internet is for digital cookies only, okay?
[413.50 --> 414.50]  Oh my goodness.
[414.50 --> 415.50]  No physical cookies.
[415.50 --> 416.50]  Alright, thanks!
[416.50 --> 417.50]  It's been a great show!
[417.50 --> 422.50]  Oh man.
[422.50 --> 423.50]  Um...
[423.50 --> 428.50]  Anyway, the point is, like, I wouldn't know about stuff like that, and over the course of
[428.50 --> 430.50]  my career, I have...
[430.50 --> 432.50]  How do I put it?
[432.50 --> 437.50]  I have made at least one questionable choice when it came to deciding on people to collab
[437.50 --> 439.50]  with, and if I had...
[439.50 --> 441.50]  At least one, eh?
[441.50 --> 444.50]  That's all I'm saying, because otherwise I might end up identifying someone.
[444.50 --> 445.50]  Okay.
[445.50 --> 446.50]  Alright.
[446.50 --> 449.50]  Look, I've told you this a hundred times.
[449.50 --> 451.50]  My life is a drama-free zone.
[451.50 --> 452.50]  Oh yeah!
[452.50 --> 455.50]  I sometimes violate my policy.
[456.50 --> 457.50]  But it is my goal.
[457.50 --> 461.50]  It is an aspirational statement, okay?
[461.50 --> 469.50]  And the point is, if I had stayed up to date on some of this stuff, I may have made different decisions at least once.
[469.50 --> 470.50]  Yeah.
[470.50 --> 471.50]  Yeah, yeah.
[471.50 --> 472.50]  There's...
[472.50 --> 473.50]  Yeah.
[473.50 --> 474.50]  I'm not gonna go into that further.
[474.50 --> 475.50]  Yeah.
[475.50 --> 481.50]  It's great, because no one in the chat seems to agree about who I'm talking about, which is telling in and of itself.
[481.50 --> 482.50]  Yeah.
[482.50 --> 483.50]  Yeah.
[483.50 --> 484.50]  Yeah.
[484.50 --> 485.50]  That's amazing.
[485.50 --> 486.50]  Oh, okay.
[486.50 --> 487.50]  No, no, no.
[487.50 --> 488.50]  Okay, okay, okay.
[488.50 --> 491.50]  I completely misread someone's...
[491.50 --> 493.50]  I misread someone's thing there.
[493.50 --> 494.50]  So, okay.
[494.50 --> 495.50]  You know what though?
[495.50 --> 497.50]  Maybe there's room for another interpretation here.
[497.50 --> 503.50]  Do you think that there is a group of people that would blame advertisers for the downfall of Twitter?
[503.50 --> 504.50]  100%.
[504.50 --> 514.50]  Because they don't realize that Twitter was never profitable before, and that making it worse and getting in a bunch of legal trouble is probably not going to help it survive?
[514.50 --> 516.50]  I guarantee you at least some people would.
[517.50 --> 518.50]  Uh...
[518.50 --> 523.50]  Is it just as simple as that Elon said it, or would they have come up with that on their own?
[523.50 --> 524.50]  Both, I think, to be honest.
[524.50 --> 525.50]  Really? Okay.
[525.50 --> 527.50]  I'm sorry because Elon said it, but I think some people...
[527.50 --> 528.50]  Because people were already on this train.
[528.50 --> 529.50]  Okay, well...
[529.50 --> 530.50]  This is not a new train.
[530.50 --> 531.50]  Now hold on a second then.
[531.50 --> 532.50]  Tell me this then.
[532.50 --> 533.50]  Yeah.
[533.50 --> 534.50]  If...
[534.50 --> 538.50]  If dbrand, okay, or MSI for that matter, both of whom I have told to go f*** themselves tonight.
[538.50 --> 539.50]  If...
[539.50 --> 542.50]  If either of them were to stop advertising with us...
[542.50 --> 543.50]  I feel like...
[543.50 --> 546.50]  I feel like doing that to dbrand makes them want to advertise a few more, but...
[546.50 --> 547.50]  But...
[547.50 --> 549.50]  MSI I'm not sure about, actually.
[549.50 --> 550.50]  Yeah, I don't know.
[550.50 --> 554.50]  There's definitely people at MSI that I have definitely told to go f*** themselves.
[554.50 --> 556.50]  Just, you know, lighthearted banter.
[556.50 --> 557.50]  As like a...
[557.50 --> 558.50]  Yeah.
[558.50 --> 559.50]  But not everyone...
[559.50 --> 561.50]  I don't have a personal relationship with everyone there.
[561.50 --> 562.50]  Uh-huh.
[562.50 --> 563.50]  So...
[563.50 --> 564.50]  Good luck me!
[564.50 --> 565.50]  We'll see, yeah.
[565.50 --> 566.50]  But...
[566.50 --> 569.50]  Okay, let's say I didn't directly attack them.
[569.50 --> 570.50]  If I said something...
[570.50 --> 571.50]  Okay, okay, okay.
[571.50 --> 572.50]  Here's a controversial issue.
[572.50 --> 573.50]  Let's take...
[573.50 --> 577.50]  Let's take the issue of Taiwan versus...
[577.50 --> 578.50]  What is it?
[578.50 --> 579.50]  ROC?
[579.50 --> 580.50]  Or...
[580.50 --> 581.50]  That's Taiwan.
[581.50 --> 582.50]  Yeah, I forget.
[582.50 --> 583.50]  I think.
[583.50 --> 584.50]  Yeah, whatever.
[584.50 --> 585.50]  The two...
[585.50 --> 587.50]  I think ROC is Taiwan and POC is China?
[587.50 --> 588.50]  I'm sorry.
[588.50 --> 589.50]  I don't remember.
[589.50 --> 591.50]  But the point is that...
[591.50 --> 592.50]  PRC?
[592.50 --> 595.50]  There's some debate over the name of that island.
[595.50 --> 596.50]  So why don't we just...
[596.50 --> 597.50]  Why don't we leave it there?
[597.50 --> 598.50]  Sure.
[598.50 --> 603.50]  And I could see, for example, a certain brand kind of going, okay, yeah, that was a red...
[603.50 --> 604.50]  That was a red line.
[604.50 --> 606.50]  You know, Linus took a stance.
[606.50 --> 607.50]  He called it Taiwan.
[607.50 --> 610.50]  He doesn't even know the other name for it.
[610.50 --> 611.50]  So...
[613.50 --> 614.50]  Whatever, right?
[614.50 --> 618.50]  The point is, you know, someone could hear that and go, okay, yeah, red line.
[618.50 --> 625.50]  If all of a sudden, you know, LTT doesn't survive anymore, whose fault is it?
[625.50 --> 626.50]  I...
[626.50 --> 627.50]  I think...
[629.50 --> 630.50]  Yeah, I don't know.
[630.50 --> 631.50]  I think...
[631.50 --> 633.50]  I think a lot of it depends on viewpoint.
[634.50 --> 637.50]  Because I think it's gonna depend on what you think of the initial statement.
[640.50 --> 641.50]  I guess so.
[641.50 --> 642.50]  But like...
[642.50 --> 643.50]  From a...
[643.50 --> 644.50]  From a...
[644.50 --> 645.50]  From just a...
[645.50 --> 646.50]  I don't know, just like...
[646.50 --> 647.50]  Almost like a free will...
[647.50 --> 648.50]  Standpoint.
[649.50 --> 654.50]  Advertisers are not obligated to advertise on a particular platform.
[654.50 --> 656.50]  I also feel like, at least for me...
[656.50 --> 657.50]  Like I just...
[657.50 --> 658.50]  I don't follow that logic.
[658.50 --> 659.50]  I'm sure there's people...
[659.50 --> 660.50]  Oh, yeah, no.
[660.50 --> 661.50]  I...
[661.50 --> 663.50]  Completely, that's really stupid, obviously.
[663.50 --> 664.50]  Yeah, agreed.
[664.50 --> 665.50]  Um, but I...
[665.50 --> 666.50]  I also...
[667.50 --> 668.50]  I'm sure some people care.
[668.50 --> 674.50]  I've never understood the like, we're gonna pull advertising on like, even this type of content
[674.50 --> 677.50]  because advertising on it means we endorse it, whatever.
[677.50 --> 682.50]  Like, when you're taking the shotgun approach and just advertising on everything, like, who cares?
[682.50 --> 693.50]  I've never seen a brand, um, have like an automated pre-roll ad on something that I didn't like or agree with and be like, I must cancel all affiliation with this brand.
[693.50 --> 694.50]  Like, I just...
[694.50 --> 695.50]  Well...
[695.50 --> 699.50]  I'm assuming they're taking a shotgun approach and I just don't care.
[699.50 --> 703.50]  You also understand how online advertising works to a degree.
[703.50 --> 704.50]  Okay.
[704.50 --> 707.50]  I don't think that, you know, your...
[707.50 --> 708.50]  Your...
[708.50 --> 709.50]  Your...
[709.50 --> 711.50]  Your great aunt Mabel necessarily understands that.
[711.50 --> 712.50]  This is a hypothetical person.
[712.50 --> 713.50]  Just...
[713.50 --> 714.50]  Don't worry about it.
[714.50 --> 716.50]  I hope I have a great aunt Mabel.
[716.50 --> 717.50]  And in the...
[717.50 --> 720.50]  And in the past, traditionally, that was the case.
[720.50 --> 728.50]  Advertisers would select television programs that were somewhat in alignment with, at the very least, the demographics they were trying to reach.
[728.50 --> 731.50]  Because it was all so much more manual back then.
[731.50 --> 734.50]  And they would tailor the messaging to who they thought they were talking to.
[734.50 --> 738.50]  And yeah, obviously, the way that that works is very different now.
[738.50 --> 753.50]  And I think that, you know, with the rise of the internet, people can be into a lot of stuff that wasn't necessarily on cable TV, you know, in the 80s, in North America, for example.
[753.50 --> 757.50]  And so, these were decisions that brands were never faced with before.
[757.50 --> 758.50]  Is, are we...
[758.50 --> 759.50]  You know...
[759.50 --> 769.50]  Are we willing to take the small hits against us from the people who still think that we have anything to do with the choice of, you know, where our stuff...
[769.50 --> 770.50]  And you know what?
[770.50 --> 771.50]  Actually, that's not even true.
[771.50 --> 773.50]  Because you do still control it to a degree.
[773.50 --> 779.50]  Like, if you're, let's say, on a pornographic website, and you saw an advertiser there...
[779.50 --> 782.50]  Okay, let's say you saw, let's say you saw Crest Whitestrips.
[782.50 --> 788.50]  You know, you know, advertising like, do you like white teeth?
[788.50 --> 789.50]  Are you into white teeth?
[789.50 --> 793.50]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[793.50 --> 794.50]  Is that your thing?
[794.50 --> 796.50]  Just slow, just slow, slow, slow.
[796.50 --> 798.50]  Give the gift of Crest Whitestrips.
[798.50 --> 799.50]  Right, like...
[799.50 --> 801.50]  So tell me, tell me you wouldn't...
[801.50 --> 802.50]  Do you hear this, Tynan?
[802.50 --> 803.50]  Do you hear this?
[803.50 --> 806.50]  Tell me you wouldn't have an association there.
[806.50 --> 807.50]  No.
[807.50 --> 812.50]  Maybe you also like mouthwash.
[812.50 --> 818.50]  Oh, wow, oh, man.
[818.50 --> 819.50]  That would actually be...
[819.50 --> 820.50]  They probably see good sales.
[820.50 --> 821.50]  That would be hilarious.
[821.50 --> 822.50]  I...
[822.50 --> 823.50]  Sure.
[823.50 --> 826.50]  Man, especially the second example there, I just would think would be so funny.
[826.50 --> 828.50]  I would probably buy their product.
[828.50 --> 830.50]  Honestly, it might drive sales.
[830.50 --> 831.50]  Guerilla marketing?
[831.50 --> 832.50]  They should try this.
[832.50 --> 833.50]  Someone should try this.
[833.50 --> 834.50]  Oh my god.
[834.50 --> 835.50]  I would respect them so much.
[835.50 --> 836.50]  Okay.
[836.50 --> 840.50]  But now, let's go one more degree of separation, right?
[840.50 --> 841.50]  We gotta do talk!
[841.50 --> 842.50]  No, we won already!
[842.50 --> 844.50]  How long has the show been running for?
[844.50 --> 845.50]  What?
[845.50 --> 846.50]  I don't know.
[846.50 --> 847.50]  Remember he was like, I'm gonna try to not respond to...
[847.50 --> 848.50]  Oh yeah, we got him.
[848.50 --> 849.50]  We got him.
[849.50 --> 850.50]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[850.50 --> 851.50]  That's not what I meant at all.
[851.50 --> 852.50]  No, like...
[852.50 --> 853.50]  Goal post moving?
[853.50 --> 854.50]  Yeah.
[854.50 --> 855.50]  Yeah, whatever.
[855.50 --> 856.50]  Whatever.
[856.50 --> 857.50]  Exactly, whatever.
[857.50 --> 858.50]  Whatever.
[858.50 --> 859.50]  Get rekt.
[859.50 --> 860.50]  Scrub.
[862.50 --> 865.50]  Anyway, the point is, let's go one degree of separation further, though.
[865.50 --> 866.50]  Okay.
[866.50 --> 867.50]  And let's hear about...
[867.50 --> 870.50]  Or let's put ourselves in the mind of the person who reads about the book
[870.50 --> 873.50]  who reads about this scandalous behavior from...
[873.50 --> 875.50]  I don't even know who markets...
[875.50 --> 876.50]  Procter and Gamble or something, probably.
[876.50 --> 877.50]  I don't even know.
[877.50 --> 878.50]  Maybe it's 3M.
[878.50 --> 880.50]  It's probably thermal paste in there anyway.
[881.50 --> 882.50]  I'm just kidding.
[882.50 --> 883.50]  Sorry, sorry.
[883.50 --> 888.50]  My great-grandmother brushed her teeth with baking soda her whole life,
[888.50 --> 893.50]  which I didn't realize was an option, even though, like, the best toothpastes are the ones that are like with baking soda.
[893.50 --> 894.50]  With baking soda.
[894.50 --> 895.50]  With baking soda.
[895.50 --> 896.50]  It's like, oh.
[896.50 --> 897.50]  So I could just get a box of...
[897.50 --> 898.50]  You could...
[898.50 --> 899.50]  Really?
[899.50 --> 901.50]  Anyway, she never had a cavity in her life, and I'm just like, that's cool.
[901.50 --> 902.50]  The year is now insert year.
[902.50 --> 904.50]  I think I'll just use, like, a baking soda toothpaste.
[904.50 --> 905.50]  It's minty.
[905.50 --> 906.50]  It makes my mouth taste nice.
[906.50 --> 907.50]  It takes some mint flavor, yeah.
[907.50 --> 908.50]  Yeah, yeah, but like, um...
[908.50 --> 909.50]  But that's pretty cool.
[909.50 --> 911.50]  I don't remember how I got onto this subject.
[911.50 --> 918.50]  The point is that we're a degree of separation removed, and someone reads about this scandalous thing.
[918.50 --> 920.50]  Okay, so my biggest thing here is...
[920.50 --> 921.50]  And they go, how could they support that?
[921.50 --> 923.50]  How could they support that industry?
[923.50 --> 926.50]  My biggest thing here is I...
[926.50 --> 928.50]  It's not a...
[928.50 --> 930.50]  The website itself...
[932.50 --> 939.50]  The idea of the website itself, because you were describing one where the idea of the website is potentially contentious.
[939.50 --> 942.50]  The idea of Twitter is not really contentious.
[942.50 --> 944.50]  It's text and...
[944.50 --> 945.50]  I mean...
[945.50 --> 946.50]  Community interaction.
[946.50 --> 947.50]  Yes and no, but...
[947.50 --> 948.50]  It's...
[948.50 --> 949.50]  By that logic...
[949.50 --> 950.50]  It's actions and comments of the CEO.
[950.50 --> 953.50]  By that logic, this is a video site.
[953.50 --> 954.50]  And this is also a video site.
[954.50 --> 957.50]  But it's a video site for very specific content, which is contentious.
[957.50 --> 958.50]  Sure, but I think what's contentious...
[958.50 --> 960.50]  But Twitter isn't for that content.
[960.50 --> 963.50]  But I think what's contentious about it is supporting that industry.
[963.50 --> 965.50]  If you want to really boil it down.
[966.50 --> 967.50]  And so...
[967.50 --> 968.50]  This is specifically comments from the CEO.
[968.50 --> 971.50]  I know, so it comes down to not wanting to support...
[971.50 --> 978.50]  But plenty of people use this site that openly, viciously hate that person.
[978.50 --> 980.50]  But it's the risk.
[980.50 --> 987.50]  It's the risk of having your brand message next to something that is highly controversial and or offensive.
[987.50 --> 990.50]  If that's true, they should have been off Twitter years ago.
[990.50 --> 996.50]  Which is, I think, the point that I was digging for in all of this.
[996.50 --> 997.50]  Yeah.
[997.50 --> 999.50]  That is the most valid take.
[999.50 --> 1008.50]  The fact that they are turning this into an opportunity to posture or virtue signal or whatever else it is, is...
[1008.50 --> 1010.50]  It just comes across disingenuous to me.
[1010.50 --> 1021.50]  It's like, if you don't support having your advertising next to content you find offensive, then honestly speaking, you might as well remove it from the internet.
[1021.50 --> 1022.50]  Yeah.
[1022.50 --> 1024.50]  You shouldn't be advertising on Reddit, that's for sure.
[1024.50 --> 1025.50]  No.
[1025.50 --> 1026.50]  Not YouTube.
[1026.50 --> 1030.50]  I don't know if Reddit allows advertisers to select specific subreddits or specific genres.
[1030.50 --> 1036.50]  Probably, probably as an advertiser you can say, look, I don't want any NSFW subreddits or something like that.
[1036.50 --> 1038.50]  Probably your only two flags though.
[1038.50 --> 1039.50]  I'd be surprised.
[1039.50 --> 1043.50]  I'm sure Reddit likes, wants to offer more tailored advertising.
[1043.50 --> 1048.50]  Like, if I'm in the LTT subreddit, it's always full of like tech ads or gaming ads and stuff like that.
[1048.50 --> 1050.50]  Like, I don't get anything for shoes.
[1050.50 --> 1052.50]  I'm gonna have to sign...
[1052.50 --> 1055.50]  Mind you, that could be just because they know I never buy shoes.
[1055.50 --> 1057.50]  Why would I?
[1057.50 --> 1062.50]  It does say target your audience, reach customers where they're the most passionate and engaged.
[1062.50 --> 1067.50]  So you can probably, yeah, pick like a style of subreddit or something like that.
[1067.50 --> 1068.50]  Question.
[1068.50 --> 1069.50]  Sup.
[1069.50 --> 1076.50]  Is it time to start an X days until Twitter dies pool?
[1076.50 --> 1078.50]  And yes, I did that on purpose.
[1078.50 --> 1081.50]  You know what?
[1081.50 --> 1084.50]  It didn't even phase me because I didn't even think about it as X.
[1084.50 --> 1086.50]  Like, it's just, it's such a weird...
[1086.50 --> 1089.50]  Uhhh.
[1089.50 --> 1094.50]  Is it time to, like, are we within the sort of 180 day...
[1094.50 --> 1095.50]  Like, it's gotta be...
[1095.50 --> 1096.50]  No, I don't think so.
[1096.50 --> 1097.50]  It's gotta be...
[1097.50 --> 1098.50]  Really?
[1098.50 --> 1099.50]  Yeah.
[1099.50 --> 1100.50]  Do you think he'll put more money in?
[1100.50 --> 1101.50]  Cause I don't think a third party...
[1101.50 --> 1104.50]  I don't think an outside investor is gonna after what happened to the last ones.
[1105.50 --> 1106.50]  They'd have to be idiots.
[1106.50 --> 1108.50]  I mean, the last ones, I don't...
[1108.50 --> 1109.50]  No offense.
[1109.50 --> 1114.50]  Man, see, how am I gonna maintain my drama free zone?
[1114.50 --> 1120.50]  When I say things like, no offense, but if you invested billions of dollars in Twitter, you're a f***ing idiot.
[1120.50 --> 1121.50]  Um...
[1121.50 --> 1122.50]  I'm sorry.
[1122.50 --> 1125.50]  If your goal was getting a financial return out of it.
[1125.50 --> 1127.50]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's true.
[1127.50 --> 1132.50]  If your goal was something else, if your goal was, you know, cozying up to Musk or...
[1132.50 --> 1133.50]  Or whatever, I don't even know.
[1133.50 --> 1137.50]  Or the fellow investor, I don't know, I don't know what your goal was.
[1137.50 --> 1141.50]  If your goal was something else, and that helps you sleep at night, or whatever, then you know what?
[1141.50 --> 1142.50]  You've made a good decision.
[1142.50 --> 1145.50]  But if your goal was the primary goal of investing...
[1145.50 --> 1147.50]  Which is to make money.
[1147.50 --> 1149.50]  I'm so sorry.
[1149.50 --> 1150.50]  That's an oof.
[1150.50 --> 1151.50]  Yeah.
[1151.50 --> 1152.50]  Um...
[1153.50 --> 1154.50]  Yeah.
[1154.50 --> 1155.50]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1155.50 --> 1157.50]  I don't know, I, I, like...
[1157.50 --> 1158.50]  Ugh.
[1158.50 --> 1160.50]  Oh no, I offended dozens of billionaires.
[1162.50 --> 1164.50]  I think I'll be okay without them.
[1164.50 --> 1165.50]  You know...
[1165.50 --> 1171.50]  I go off of the DM's page on Twitter sometimes, and just go like, what's happening out there?
[1171.50 --> 1175.50]  Not that often, but I'll poke around, and it's insane.
[1175.50 --> 1176.50]  Yeah.
[1176.50 --> 1177.50]  I, I...
[1177.50 --> 1180.50]  Like, my comment of like, they should have left a long time ago.
[1180.50 --> 1186.50]  I don't feel like the, whatever the home button page is, I don't know what it's called, for you or something.
[1186.50 --> 1187.50]  Yeah.
[1187.50 --> 1188.50]  I don't know.
[1188.50 --> 1189.50]  I don't remember.
[1189.50 --> 1195.50]  Whatever page that is, has been just complete chaos and debauchery forever, and it still is.
[1195.50 --> 1196.50]  Like, that's just...
[1196.50 --> 1198.50]  I don't know.
[1198.50 --> 1199.50]  Like...
[1199.50 --> 1202.50]  Captain Slip says, uh, I don't think they're dying anytime soon.
[1202.50 --> 1206.50]  Every social network insert I see in the news about anything is always an embedded tweet.
[1206.50 --> 1208.50]  Never mastodon, never threads.
[1208.50 --> 1210.50]  It's, it's still happening on Twitter first and foremost.
[1210.50 --> 1211.50]  And you know what?
[1211.50 --> 1212.50]  I don't deny that.
[1212.50 --> 1213.50]  It is.
[1213.50 --> 1214.50]  Their momentum...
[1214.50 --> 1215.50]  The problem is the money.
[1215.50 --> 1217.50]  They're not a public company anymore.
[1217.50 --> 1218.50]  They have to be funded somehow.
[1218.50 --> 1221.50]  They can't just take money from the world.
[1221.50 --> 1226.50]  Um, and like he was saying, unless, because it's not a public company, to gain money, he
[1226.50 --> 1228.50]  either needs to inject it himself.
[1228.50 --> 1234.50]  Uh, which, as far as I know, the only thing he has been willing to put on the line is shares.
[1234.50 --> 1236.50]  No dollar dollars.
[1236.50 --> 1237.50]  Um...
[1237.50 --> 1239.50]  No, I think he, I think he...
[1239.50 --> 1240.50]  Or he's gonna have to get more investors.
[1240.50 --> 1241.50]  No, he sold shares for cash.
[1241.50 --> 1242.50]  Oh, did he?
[1242.50 --> 1243.50]  To make the purchase.
[1243.50 --> 1244.50]  Yeah, yeah, if I recall correctly.
[1244.50 --> 1247.50]  I thought he put the shares up as like collateral or something.
[1247.50 --> 1248.50]  You know what?
[1248.50 --> 1250.50]  Uh, okay, I'm not gonna lie.
[1250.50 --> 1251.50]  I don't remember.
[1251.50 --> 1252.50]  When it passed...
[1252.50 --> 1253.50]  I could be wrong.
[1253.50 --> 1260.50]  ...past mortgages, and like basic, buy stock, it go up, make money, it go down, lose money.
[1260.50 --> 1261.50]  It's not my world.
[1261.50 --> 1262.50]  Me neither.
[1262.50 --> 1267.50]  It's, it's, it's, it's one of those things where I, I would probably need more than the fingers
[1267.50 --> 1272.50]  on both of my hands to count the number of times I've had to look up exactly how shorting
[1272.50 --> 1273.50]  a stock works.
[1273.50 --> 1277.50]  Like, fundamentally, I, I like, I like kind of understand it.
[1277.50 --> 1282.50]  You, you're, you're committing to buy later, but at a lower price.
[1282.50 --> 1286.50]  So if it goes down, then you make money.
[1286.50 --> 1288.50]  Like I, I, okay.
[1288.50 --> 1295.50]  But then the number of times that I've like landed on Wikipedia, read through it, gone,
[1295.50 --> 1301.50]  okay, this is exactly the mechanism, and then promptly forgotten about it.
[1301.50 --> 1302.50]  Okay.
[1302.50 --> 1305.50]  And then it's come up in the news again, and I'm like, man, this is so frustrating.
[1305.50 --> 1306.50]  I knew how this worked.
[1306.50 --> 1308.50]  I get, okay, okay, how does it work?
[1308.50 --> 1310.50]  I'm like, just, I'm sorry.
[1310.50 --> 1314.50]  Uh, TPRNL says the For You tab is totally based on who you follow.
[1314.50 --> 1315.50]  I don't believe that.
[1315.50 --> 1318.50]  Uh, just remove the rotten apples in who you follow.
[1318.50 --> 1319.50]  Yeah, okay.
[1319.50 --> 1321.50]  It's like a bunch of tech people.
[1321.50 --> 1323.50]  There's people I follow for work.
[1323.50 --> 1330.50]  There used to be people that I followed that would just straight up like just porn.
[1330.50 --> 1335.50]  And it would show up in my feed and I'd be like, what are you doing?
[1335.50 --> 1342.50]  Like, do you know that this like shows to everyone that you've done this?
[1342.50 --> 1343.50]  I don't know.
[1343.50 --> 1344.50]  Yeah.
[1344.50 --> 1347.50]  Like, I'm not gonna go, I'm not gonna DM a grown man and be like, BT dubs.
[1347.50 --> 1348.50]  Hey, why are you horny on me?
[1348.50 --> 1353.50]  Everyone sees what you're into and I really didn't follow you for that?
[1353.50 --> 1355.50]  And I would prefer if you didn't.
[1355.50 --> 1356.50]  Um.
[1356.50 --> 1357.50]  I don't know.
[1357.50 --> 1364.50]  It's a funny thing because the way that I was raised was honestly pretty open about that.
[1364.50 --> 1366.50]  Like when I was, when I was.
[1366.50 --> 1368.50]  But you're effectively posting it to everyone else.
[1368.50 --> 1369.50]  No, no, hold on, hold on.
[1369.50 --> 1370.50]  There's a different.
[1370.50 --> 1372.50]  No, when I was young, okay.
[1372.50 --> 1391.50]  I, I have family members, friends, and even my own house that would have, okay, more on the artful side, but definitely have large, very nude prints, you know, in their houses.
[1391.50 --> 1398.50]  Um, you know, I, I, I, I visited like family, friends who definitely just had pinups, literally pinned up.
[1398.50 --> 1404.50]  Like, you know, in their bathroom or in their house or whatever, you know, calendars openly on display.
[1404.50 --> 1405.50]  In the garage.
[1405.50 --> 1406.50]  In the garage.
[1406.50 --> 1407.50]  Yep.
[1407.50 --> 1411.50]  My, um, one of my parental units, I'm just not gonna name them just to make it easier.
[1411.50 --> 1416.50]  Um, so that I don't have to answer questions about this later, cause I can just say, oh no, I was referring to the other one.
[1416.50 --> 1423.50]  Um, one of my, one of my parental units had a deck of Playboy playing cards, uh, or either Playboy or Penthouse.
[1423.50 --> 1426.50]  Like, like, I don't think Playboy because it was not that classy.
[1426.50 --> 1429.50]  So, it must have been like Penthouse or Hustler or something.
[1429.50 --> 1433.50]  But like, I, I had access to those at, you know, eight or nine.
[1433.50 --> 1438.50]  And yet, I'm actually hyper conservative about that sort of thing.
[1438.50 --> 1451.50]  Like, I, I, I, I, I, I see people just who are like, like, and, and so like, what I'm trying to explain is, I grew up with it just being normal to just like have pornography in your house.
[1451.50 --> 1456.50]  And, but to me, the idea of broadcasting that on Twitter.
[1456.50 --> 1457.50]  To the internet.
[1457.50 --> 1460.50]  To these people that follow you for tech content or whatever it is.
[1460.50 --> 1467.50]  I mean, at the, at the very least, I, I would, I, I would personally, if I felt, if I felt compelled to share it.
[1467.50 --> 1468.50]  And you know what?
[1468.50 --> 1472.50]  I'm, I'm not judging the kinds of shared experiences that people want to have.
[1472.50 --> 1473.50]  I, I actually am not.
[1473.50 --> 1474.50]  Sure.
[1474.50 --> 1476.50]  But I just, maybe an alt account.
[1476.50 --> 1477.50]  Have an alt!
[1477.50 --> 1481.50]  And you can link to it and say like, this is the not safe for work alt, whatever.
[1481.50 --> 1482.50]  That's fine.
[1482.50 --> 1487.50]  But put it behind, you know, make me take another step.
[1488.50 --> 1494.50]  Or indicate really, really, really early on that this is like something that you do on there or something.
[1494.50 --> 1495.50]  I don't know.
[1495.50 --> 1496.50]  Hi, AJ.
[1496.50 --> 1497.50]  Bye, AJ.
[1497.50 --> 1498.50]  And.
[1498.50 --> 1499.50]  What are you looking for?
[1499.50 --> 1500.50]  Do you need something?
[1500.50 --> 1501.50]  Hold on, Luke.
[1501.50 --> 1502.50]  This is breaking news.
[1502.50 --> 1503.50]  Yes.
[1503.50 --> 1504.50]  Clickbait works.
[1504.50 --> 1505.50]  That's right.
[1505.50 --> 1506.50]  Experts agree.
[1506.50 --> 1519.50]  All you have to do is put this in your livestream title.
[1519.50 --> 1522.50]  Also, Dbrand language.
[1522.50 --> 1523.50]  Yeah.
[1523.50 --> 1524.50]  Okay.
[1524.50 --> 1525.50]  Yeah.
[1525.50 --> 1527.50]  This is a Christian Minecraft server.
[1527.50 --> 1528.50]  Mean.
[1528.50 --> 1532.50]  They can't, they said a mean word to us.
[1532.50 --> 1533.50]  That's not okay.
[1533.50 --> 1534.50]  Yeah!
[1534.50 --> 1535.50]  Yeah.
[1535.50 --> 1536.50]  Yeah.
[1536.50 --> 1537.50]  We only implied a mean word.
[1537.50 --> 1539.50]  Anywho.
[1539.50 --> 1540.50]  Oh boy.
[1540.50 --> 1548.50]  Actually, I haven't even looked at what viewership is like for the stream overall.
[1548.50 --> 1550.50]  Did this, did this work on everybody?
[1550.50 --> 1551.50]  Whoa!
[1551.50 --> 1553.50]  Okay, it's pretty good.
[1553.50 --> 1556.50]  Usually it's not that much this early in the show.
[1556.50 --> 1558.50]  Man, we should say that every week.
[1558.50 --> 1559.50]  Yeah, cool.
[1559.50 --> 1561.50]  We should just find a sponsor and just be like, yeah!
[1561.50 --> 1562.50]  I'll f*** you!
[1562.50 --> 1563.50]  And f*** you!
[1563.50 --> 1568.50]  I mean, it won't last long, but boy will it ever be a wild ride.
[1568.50 --> 1572.50]  Wancho will do slightly better for a few weeks.
[1572.50 --> 1575.50]  Hey, maybe they'll make it up in like, screwdrivers.
[1575.50 --> 1576.50]  Hey, yeah, yeah.
[1576.50 --> 1577.50]  Should be fine.
[1577.50 --> 1578.50]  Or, uh, hoodies.
[1578.50 --> 1579.50]  Hoodies.
[1579.50 --> 1580.50]  Jacob S. got the hoodie.
[1580.50 --> 1581.50]  Hey, nice.
[1581.50 --> 1583.50]  Oh yeah, I'm gonna get the laptop bag later.
[1583.50 --> 1586.50]  Hey, speaking of creator warehouse stuff, why don't we jump into our next topic, which is
[1586.50 --> 1590.50]  apparently, um, that Tynan is gonna be joining us?
[1590.50 --> 1591.50]  Do you have like a microphone?
[1591.50 --> 1592.50]  Yeah.
[1592.50 --> 1593.50]  Or like, how does this even work?
[1593.50 --> 1597.50]  He's just been, he's been, he's been skulking.
[1597.50 --> 1599.50]  I love that word.
[1599.50 --> 1601.50]  And I love using it.
[1601.50 --> 1603.50]  He's been skulking over there.
[1603.50 --> 1605.50]  And he's got a box.
[1605.50 --> 1606.50]  He does.
[1606.50 --> 1608.50]  He's been box skulking.
[1608.50 --> 1609.50]  Which sounds way dirtier than it is.
[1609.50 --> 1610.50]  That really does.
[1610.50 --> 1611.50]  Especially with the previous topics.
[1611.50 --> 1612.50]  He's a box skulker.
[1612.50 --> 1613.50]  So what is this?
[1613.50 --> 1615.50]  Uh, I don't know, but it's apparently an emergency.
[1615.50 --> 1616.50]  Oh.
[1616.50 --> 1621.50]  Got the, got that EMS, got that EMS tape right on there.
[1621.50 --> 1622.50]  Yeah.
[1622.50 --> 1623.50]  That's a courier, right?
[1623.50 --> 1624.50]  I don't know.
[1624.50 --> 1625.50]  Let me see.
[1625.50 --> 1626.50]  It sounds...
[1626.50 --> 1628.50]  Don't shake it too much.
[1628.50 --> 1629.50]  Okay.
[1629.50 --> 1630.50]  Okay.
[1630.50 --> 1631.50]  Whatever's in there is marching.
[1631.50 --> 1633.50]  He just, he just, he just said don't shake it.
[1633.50 --> 1634.50]  Don't shake it.
[1634.50 --> 1635.50]  Well, yeah, he didn't define too much.
[1635.50 --> 1637.50]  This doesn't seem like too much to me.
[1637.50 --> 1638.50]  Oh my goodness.
[1638.50 --> 1639.50]  Okay, hold on.
[1639.50 --> 1643.50]  Usually I would interpret that as like, don't shake it any more than absolutely required.
[1643.50 --> 1644.50]  Coward.
[1644.50 --> 1645.50]  Okay.
[1645.50 --> 1646.50]  Mind line.
[1646.50 --> 1649.50]  Would you like to, would you like to do the care and handling instructions?
[1649.50 --> 1650.50]  Sure.
[1650.50 --> 1651.50]  Yeah.
[1651.50 --> 1652.50]  Okay.
[1652.50 --> 1653.50]  It's not like you're going to pay attention to them, so.
[1653.50 --> 1654.50]  Yeah.
[1654.50 --> 1657.50]  Well, one of these things I think I figured out what it's for.
[1657.50 --> 1659.50]  You should just ceremoniously draw, ooh.
[1659.50 --> 1662.50]  You should just ceremoniously drop it.
[1662.50 --> 1663.50]  Okay.
[1663.50 --> 1668.50]  Uh, I don't know where I'm supposed to, okay.
[1668.50 --> 1669.50]  Oh my gosh.
[1669.50 --> 1670.50]  That looks really long.
[1670.50 --> 1671.50]  I don't think you can read that whole.
[1671.50 --> 1672.50]  You definitely don't have to read all of that.
[1672.50 --> 1682.50]  You know, there was like, there, it's in like a thing, which opens backwards, and then
[1682.50 --> 1685.50]  they didn't use the inside of it to type.
[1685.50 --> 1687.50]  Okay, so basically it looks like my daughters made it.
[1687.50 --> 1688.50]  This is advanced difficulty.
[1688.50 --> 1689.50]  Brass.
[1689.50 --> 1693.50]  Brass will naturally develop a patina over time, giving it a dull finish.
[1693.50 --> 1694.50]  Okay.
[1694.50 --> 1697.50]  The very tip of the brass screwdriver is brass plated steel.
[1697.50 --> 1698.50]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1698.50 --> 1699.50]  The very tip of what now?
[1699.50 --> 1702.50]  Uh, the, the brass plated screwdriver.
[1702.50 --> 1705.50]  Now might be a good time to look at the pieces on the inside of the boxes.
[1705.50 --> 1706.50]  Okay.
[1706.50 --> 1708.50]  I feel like, whoa, whoa.
[1708.50 --> 1709.50]  Hello, buddy.
[1709.50 --> 1710.50]  Hold on, hold on, hold on a second.
[1710.50 --> 1711.50]  Okay.
[1711.50 --> 1712.50]  What's happening?
[1712.50 --> 1713.50]  We're going to do the, oh, wow.
[1713.50 --> 1714.50]  That's an interesting framing for the Linus cam.
[1714.50 --> 1715.50]  No, no, it's perfect.
[1715.50 --> 1716.50]  It might actually be very convenient for this.
[1716.50 --> 1717.50]  Yeah, it's perfect, Dan.
[1717.50 --> 1719.50]  Oh, uh, well, it was perfect and then I ruined it.
[1719.50 --> 1720.50]  No, no, you're good.
[1720.50 --> 1721.50]  You're good.
[1721.50 --> 1722.50]  Linus, it's behind the banner.
[1722.50 --> 1723.50]  Lift it up.
[1723.50 --> 1724.50]  I'm trying.
[1724.50 --> 1725.50]  Is this your first time doing this?
[1725.50 --> 1727.50]  I lifted it up and then, and then this thing came down.
[1727.50 --> 1728.50]  You have two hands.
[1728.50 --> 1729.50]  Use them.
[1729.50 --> 1730.50]  Oh my God.
[1730.50 --> 1731.50]  Jeez.
[1731.50 --> 1732.50]  All right.
[1732.50 --> 1733.50]  I'm using one of them.
[1733.50 --> 1734.50]  Yeah.
[1734.50 --> 1735.50]  You like that?
[1735.50 --> 1737.50]  I show up and all chaos unfolds.
[1737.50 --> 1738.50]  Glorious.
[1738.50 --> 1739.50]  It's always like this.
[1739.50 --> 1742.50]  Oh no.
[1742.50 --> 1748.50]  I think, I think the chaos is exponentially proportional to the number of people here.
[1748.50 --> 1749.50]  Yeah.
[1749.50 --> 1750.50]  That sounds about right.
[1750.50 --> 1751.50]  What can I say?
[1751.50 --> 1752.50]  I just like when people watch.
[1752.50 --> 1753.50]  I get excited.
[1753.50 --> 1754.50]  Oh man.
[1754.50 --> 1755.50]  Okay.
[1755.50 --> 1760.50]  I think what I'm looking at are some prototypes.
[1760.50 --> 1764.50]  These look very kind of not handcrafted.
[1764.50 --> 1770.50]  Obviously these are, these are machined, but it looks like various sort of components.
[1770.50 --> 1771.50]  Very, yeah.
[1771.50 --> 1778.50]  Like attempts almost at something like this one has a two of the flat sides kind of applied
[1778.50 --> 1779.50]  to it.
[1779.50 --> 1783.50]  This looks like, Oh, I think I, I think I see what's happening here.
[1783.50 --> 1785.50]  This looks like a selector ring.
[1785.50 --> 1788.50]  Uh, wait, hold on a second.
[1788.50 --> 1792.50]  Well, this is obviously one of our ratchet mechanisms and shafts.
[1792.50 --> 1794.50]  I would recognize it anywhere.
[1794.50 --> 1799.50]  And there's a whole bunch of other little, like this was, this was lathed and this is
[1799.50 --> 1800.50]  really good.
[1800.50 --> 1802.50]  It's, uh, flared out at the tip.
[1802.50 --> 1803.50]  So that's safe.
[1806.50 --> 1810.50]  The ratchet that was ours may have came from us putting it in the box accidentally.
[1810.50 --> 1811.50]  Oh, we put it in there.
[1811.50 --> 1812.50]  Oh, okay.
[1812.50 --> 1813.50]  Okay.
[1813.50 --> 1814.50]  Okay.
[1814.50 --> 1817.50]  So I think, I think we're about to see something here.
[1817.50 --> 1821.50]  For display purposes, the metal can be polished back to a shiny finish.
[1821.50 --> 1824.50]  The recommended polishing compound is something, something.
[1824.50 --> 1825.50]  Caution.
[1825.50 --> 1827.50]  Please avoid excessive polish.
[1827.50 --> 1828.50]  Oh, whatever.
[1828.50 --> 1829.50]  Yeah.
[1829.50 --> 1831.50]  None of that's super important for you too.
[1831.50 --> 1832.50]  I'm afraid I can't come into that.
[1832.50 --> 1835.50]  The ratchet mechanism is based on a readily available screwdriver.
[1835.50 --> 1837.50]  Performance is not on par with the LTT version.
[1837.50 --> 1838.50]  Nothing is.
[1838.50 --> 1841.50]  There's a dead spot in the mechanism for manufacturing mistake.
[1841.50 --> 1842.50]  There's no cause for concern.
[1842.50 --> 1847.50]  Uh, if the certain mechanism feels tight and uneven cause it's not ours.
[1847.50 --> 1848.50]  Okay.
[1848.50 --> 1850.50]  So there are two drivers in there.
[1850.50 --> 1851.50]  There's two drivers.
[1851.50 --> 1852.50]  Oh.
[1852.50 --> 1853.50]  Oh.
[1853.50 --> 1855.50]  You, you might want to take it out entirely.
[1855.50 --> 1856.50]  Oh yeah.
[1856.50 --> 1857.50]  There you go.
[1857.50 --> 1860.50]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1860.50 --> 1864.50]  Just in time for the Christmas season.
[1864.50 --> 1866.50]  Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.
[1866.50 --> 1867.50]  Silver and gold.
[1867.50 --> 1868.50]  Silver and gold.
[1868.50 --> 1869.50]  Silver and gold.
[1869.50 --> 1870.50]  Silver and gold.
[1870.50 --> 1873.50]  I don't think I should even touch them because of how oily my hands are.
[1873.50 --> 1874.50]  No, no, you're good.
[1874.50 --> 1875.50]  That's fine.
[1875.50 --> 1877.50]  Uh, Dan, um, that's, uh, okay.
[1877.50 --> 1878.50]  Good, I guess.
[1878.50 --> 1879.50]  Good job.
[1879.50 --> 1880.50]  Wow.
[1880.50 --> 1881.50]  Okay.
[1881.50 --> 1884.50]  So now, hold on a second.
[1884.50 --> 1885.50]  Those look insane.
[1885.50 --> 1887.50]  What am I looking at?
[1887.50 --> 1888.50]  Okay.
[1888.50 --> 1891.50]  That, okay.
[1891.50 --> 1892.50]  Man.
[1892.50 --> 1893.50]  Those look actually insane.
[1893.50 --> 1894.50]  Man.
[1894.50 --> 1895.50]  Those look actually insane.
[1895.50 --> 1897.50]  So the two drivers are quite different.
[1897.50 --> 1898.50]  Oh.
[1898.50 --> 1899.50]  Okay.
[1899.50 --> 1900.50]  No, no, I can tell.
[1900.50 --> 1901.50]  Wait.
[1901.50 --> 1902.50]  Recognize that?
[1902.50 --> 1905.50]  Yeah, this one's our ratchet.
[1905.50 --> 1906.50]  Mostly, yeah.
[1906.50 --> 1907.50]  Oh, okay.
[1907.50 --> 1908.50]  Listen to this.
[1908.50 --> 1909.50]  Extras.
[1909.50 --> 1914.50]  In the package is a grab bag full of a selection of scrap slash prototype parts.
[1914.50 --> 1918.50]  Probably about 500 bucks worth of shiny but equally useless parts.
[1918.50 --> 1919.50]  Wow.
[1919.50 --> 1920.50]  Okay.
[1920.50 --> 1922.50]  Small insight into the months of manufacturing.
[1922.50 --> 1925.50]  Feel free to keep the grab bag.
[1925.50 --> 1926.50]  Oh.
[1926.50 --> 1927.50]  So we are sending back the drivers.
[1927.50 --> 1928.50]  Yeah.
[1928.50 --> 1930.50]  This one is actually functional.
[1930.50 --> 1931.50]  Whoa.
[1931.50 --> 1933.50]  That is so cool.
[1933.50 --> 1934.50]  Okay, here.
[1934.50 --> 1935.50]  Do you wanna, do you wanna check this out?
[1935.50 --> 1937.50]  I gotta, I gotta show them the next one.
[1937.50 --> 1938.50]  So this one.
[1938.50 --> 1939.50]  Whoa.
[1939.50 --> 1942.50]  This one weighs.
[1942.50 --> 1943.50]  Um.
[1943.50 --> 1944.50]  Oh yeah.
[1944.50 --> 1945.50]  Oh yeah.
[1945.50 --> 1946.50]  No, it had.
[1946.50 --> 1947.50]  Yep.
[1947.50 --> 1948.50]  Yeah.
[1948.50 --> 1949.50]  I mean, it also goes the wrong way.
[1949.50 --> 1950.50]  Yeah.
[1950.50 --> 1956.50]  This one is not as functional as the other one, but this is polished brass gets that gold
[1956.50 --> 1957.50]  looking.
[1957.50 --> 1958.50]  Yeah, it does.
[1958.50 --> 1959.50]  That looks flippin incredible.
[1959.50 --> 1963.50]  And the tip is plated and you can kind of see how it looks different than the rest of
[1963.50 --> 1964.50]  the piece.
[1964.50 --> 1965.50]  It's crazy.
[1965.50 --> 1966.50]  Wow.
[1966.50 --> 1970.50]  And this one was the one that was based off of a different mechanism.
[1970.50 --> 1971.50]  You know what?
[1971.50 --> 1977.50]  They did a pretty good job of, I mean, at least as, as close as I think you can get, um,
[1977.50 --> 1982.50]  with not using a plastic molded part, like having to do with flat surfaces, but pretty
[1982.50 --> 1984.50]  close to the hand feel of our draw.
[1984.50 --> 1987.50]  Oh, oh, Tynan has something else for us.
[1987.50 --> 1988.50]  I do.
[1988.50 --> 1989.50]  Okay.
[1989.50 --> 1992.50]  Does the person who made these know that they didn't need to do that?
[1992.50 --> 1995.50]  I mean, that's never the point when you're making something like that.
[1995.50 --> 1996.50]  That's fair, but.
[1996.50 --> 1998.50]  That is pretty true.
[1998.50 --> 1999.50]  It is.
[1999.50 --> 2002.50]  This is what we have coming.
[2002.50 --> 2004.50]  Have you seen this yet, Luke?
[2004.50 --> 2005.50]  Yes, actually.
[2005.50 --> 2007.50]  Oh, I've, I've snuck a peek.
[2007.50 --> 2008.50]  That's way less fun.
[2008.50 --> 2015.50]  Um, Tynan, how close is this one to what we are planning to launch?
[2015.50 --> 2020.50]  Surface finishes may be a bit different, but other than that, it should be pretty close
[2020.50 --> 2022.50]  to being ready.
[2022.50 --> 2028.50]  So I was, I was, uh, I was playing it up a little bit.
[2028.50 --> 2033.50]  I know that polished brass looks a lot like gold because we are going with polished grass,
[2033.50 --> 2040.50]  black blast, uh, polished brass because I thought it looked so amazing for the accents on our aluminum
[2040.50 --> 2041.50]  driver.
[2041.50 --> 2045.50]  Now, obviously it's not going to look as bling tastic as this.
[2045.50 --> 2049.50]  So he definitely did still have to make his own if he wanted something that looked like that.
[2049.50 --> 2055.50]  But for the rest of you, uh, the functionality of this is up to LTT standard.
[2055.50 --> 2060.50]  So it's really got that nice, satisfying pop mechanism.
[2060.50 --> 2063.50]  Uh, the team worked extraordinarily hard.
[2063.50 --> 2064.50]  At least that's what they tell me.
[2064.50 --> 2065.50]  I don't know.
[2065.50 --> 2066.50]  I can never tell.
[2066.50 --> 2067.50]  No, just kidding.
[2067.50 --> 2068.50]  They worked hard.
[2068.50 --> 2071.50]  Um, retuning the selector ring.
[2071.50 --> 2074.50]  And I believe you guys had to make some changes to the ratchet under it.
[2074.50 --> 2075.50]  Is that correct?
[2075.50 --> 2076.50]  I don't, I don't remember.
[2076.50 --> 2077.50]  No.
[2077.50 --> 2078.50]  Okay.
[2078.50 --> 2081.50]  So they, but they had to play around a lot with the selector ring because the way that
[2081.50 --> 2088.50]  the, the, the, the sort of one time, um, fit works on the plastic one did not work very
[2088.50 --> 2089.50]  well for metal.
[2089.50 --> 2097.50]  And so the earlier ones, it was, I think one millimeter wider and it was, it was very noticeable.
[2097.50 --> 2100.50]  It, it, I was like, Oh, this, this feels wrong.
[2100.50 --> 2102.50]  Um, uh, please fix it.
[2102.50 --> 2103.50]  Please fix.
[2103.50 --> 2104.50]  And they were like, Oh, okay.
[2104.50 --> 2106.50]  We knew you were going to say that, but okay.
[2106.50 --> 2110.50]  Uh, our meetings often go quite like that.
[2110.50 --> 2111.50]  Yeah.
[2111.50 --> 2116.50]  So the person who made the other drivers got around the same problem in a different way.
[2116.50 --> 2117.50]  Oh, that's so cool.
[2117.50 --> 2118.50]  If you look at the stainless steel driver.
[2118.50 --> 2119.50]  Yeah.
[2119.50 --> 2120.50]  Okay.
[2120.50 --> 2121.50]  Here, I'm going to your cam Luke.
[2121.50 --> 2126.50]  If you spin it, like if you select it, you can see that the top piece doesn't move.
[2126.50 --> 2127.50]  Oh yeah.
[2127.50 --> 2128.50]  No, I felt that.
[2128.50 --> 2129.50]  I felt that already.
[2129.50 --> 2132.50]  What they did was they threaded it onto the zinc housing.
[2132.50 --> 2136.50]  So they threaded it onto the zinc housing and then lock tighted it and then have the actual
[2136.50 --> 2138.50]  selector be a second, a separate piece.
[2138.50 --> 2139.50]  That's actually a really good idea.
[2139.50 --> 2144.50]  So it's hard to see in the camera, but right on the edge of my fingernail, that's where the
[2144.50 --> 2146.50]  seam is.
[2146.50 --> 2148.50]  That is so cool.
[2148.50 --> 2151.50]  So they definitely did some development themselves to make these work.
[2151.50 --> 2153.50]  I, I, I love it.
[2153.50 --> 2154.50]  It's remarkable.
[2154.50 --> 2156.50]  These are, these are really cool.
[2156.50 --> 2157.50]  It is.
[2157.50 --> 2165.50]  I always think nothing could surprise me anymore about just the passion of our community,
[2165.50 --> 2167.50]  the tech community in general.
[2167.50 --> 2171.50]  And then I'll say, I'll find, I'll see doom running on like a fridge, you know, or, or,
[2171.50 --> 2172.50]  or whatever.
[2172.50 --> 2173.50]  Right.
[2173.50 --> 2176.50]  It's, it didn't serve any purpose.
[2176.50 --> 2179.50]  It served no purpose other than, well, that's cool.
[2179.50 --> 2181.50]  And I'm going to do it.
[2181.50 --> 2185.50]  I just, then I love that.
[2185.50 --> 2188.50]  I don't think we're going to release anything this heavy.
[2188.50 --> 2189.50]  Uh, yeah.
[2189.50 --> 2190.50]  I just go.
[2190.50 --> 2192.50]  No, he likes his heavy one.
[2192.50 --> 2197.50]  His like stupid 3d printed steel one or whatever, but like, it's a lot heavier though.
[2197.50 --> 2198.50]  It's hard to use heavy.
[2198.50 --> 2199.50]  It's unpleasant.
[2199.50 --> 2200.50]  It's unpleasant.
[2200.50 --> 2204.50]  I actually find it like unbalances my body heavy.
[2204.50 --> 2206.50]  Like it's not, it's not good.
[2206.50 --> 2212.50]  Uh, but the aluminum one with the brass accents, we found that that was a good compromise, you
[2212.50 --> 2215.50]  know, looking at it under this light tine and I'm not a hundred percent sold.
[2215.50 --> 2218.50]  Is this pretty close to the finish that I had said I, I preferred.
[2218.50 --> 2219.50]  I can't remember.
[2219.50 --> 2221.50]  Aluminum finish is going to change still.
[2221.50 --> 2222.50]  The aluminum finish.
[2222.50 --> 2223.50]  So again, okay.
[2223.50 --> 2224.50]  Yeah.
[2224.50 --> 2225.50]  But we're pretty settled on the shiny brass, I think.
[2225.50 --> 2226.50]  Right.
[2226.50 --> 2227.50]  Yeah.
[2227.50 --> 2229.50]  It's a really nice patina over time.
[2229.50 --> 2233.50]  Oh, and it's going to be so much better of a fidget toy too.
[2233.50 --> 2234.50]  Just because.
[2234.50 --> 2235.50]  Oh yeah.
[2235.50 --> 2236.50]  Yeah.
[2236.50 --> 2237.50]  It's been for a long time.
[2237.50 --> 2241.50]  Is the, is the right word inertia or momentum in this case?
[2241.50 --> 2242.50]  Both.
[2242.50 --> 2243.50]  Both.
[2243.50 --> 2245.50]  Cause they're basically the same thing functionally, right?
[2245.50 --> 2246.50]  More or less.
[2246.50 --> 2247.50]  Okay.
[2247.50 --> 2248.50]  Then I'm not going to stress about it.
[2248.50 --> 2250.50]  I want to hear the, uh, the closing sound.
[2250.50 --> 2251.50]  It makes nice and close to the mic.
[2251.50 --> 2254.50]  No, they have more inertia, which gives them more momentum.
[2254.50 --> 2255.50]  Right.
[2255.50 --> 2256.50]  Okay.
[2256.50 --> 2257.50]  I understand it.
[2257.50 --> 2258.50]  Excellent.
[2258.50 --> 2259.50]  Good job, Linus.
[2259.50 --> 2260.50]  They're close enough.
[2260.50 --> 2261.50]  Okay.
[2261.50 --> 2262.50]  Sorry.
[2262.50 --> 2263.50]  What were you going to say, Dan?
[2263.50 --> 2265.50]  Oh, I want to, I want to hear it close next to the mic a little bit better.
[2265.50 --> 2267.50]  Cause it's just a beautiful sound.
[2267.50 --> 2268.50]  Oh, yeah.
[2268.50 --> 2271.50]  Love it.
[2271.50 --> 2272.50]  Anyway.
[2272.50 --> 2273.50]  Yeah.
[2273.50 --> 2275.50]  That is so cool.
[2275.50 --> 2280.50]  Thanks for sending these over to us just to check out and we will get them back to you
[2280.50 --> 2281.50]  in.
[2281.50 --> 2283.50]  Oh, I just, I love that.
[2283.50 --> 2284.50]  It's a set.
[2284.50 --> 2287.50]  Oh, they look, they look so good together.
[2287.50 --> 2288.50]  Okay.
[2288.50 --> 2293.50]  So Tynan, I guess what that means is that for all the product photography for this, we have
[2293.50 --> 2296.50]  to do an inverse version just so that we can like have that look.
[2296.50 --> 2297.50]  No, I'm kidding.
[2297.50 --> 2298.50]  I'm kidding.
[2298.50 --> 2299.50]  I'm kidding.
[2299.50 --> 2300.50]  I mean, it's doable.
[2300.50 --> 2301.50]  It would be so heavy.
[2301.50 --> 2302.50]  It's so much.
[2302.50 --> 2306.50]  It's so much fun seeing the look on his face in person compared to just seeing him talk
[2306.50 --> 2307.50]  in chat.
[2307.50 --> 2308.50]  Yeah.
[2308.50 --> 2309.50]  Yeah.
[2309.50 --> 2310.50]  Had to be here every now and then.
[2310.50 --> 2311.50]  Yeah.
[2311.50 --> 2312.50]  Thank you so much for showing us that.
[2312.50 --> 2314.50]  Oh, oh, this isn't the only thing.
[2314.50 --> 2315.50]  No, he's got another one.
[2315.50 --> 2317.50]  What about second box?
[2317.50 --> 2318.50]  It's the mining backpack.
[2318.50 --> 2322.50]  So we actually had this as a topic and I guess it's here.
[2322.50 --> 2323.50]  That's what I think is happening at least.
[2323.50 --> 2324.50]  Yeah.
[2324.50 --> 2325.50]  Yeah.
[2325.50 --> 2326.50]  Yeah.
[2326.50 --> 2327.50]  Yeah.
[2327.50 --> 2328.50]  Yeah.
[2328.50 --> 2329.50]  Okay.
[2329.50 --> 2332.50]  So the entirety of creator warehouse was looking forward to getting this thing back to look
[2332.50 --> 2333.50]  at it.
[2333.50 --> 2334.50]  Yeah.
[2334.50 --> 2339.50]  So, I mean, should we give people the, should we give people kind of the background for this?
[2339.50 --> 2346.50]  Um, oh, it first showed up in a post on Reddit where, um, someone was talking about how
[2346.50 --> 2348.50]  Frasher 11.
[2348.50 --> 2349.50]  Uh, Frasher 11?
[2349.50 --> 2350.50]  Yeah.
[2350.50 --> 2351.50]  Yeah.
[2351.50 --> 2352.50]  Yeah.
[2352.50 --> 2353.50]  Yeah.
[2353.50 --> 2354.50]  Yeah.
[2354.50 --> 2355.50]  Yeah.
[2355.50 --> 2356.50]  There we go.
[2356.50 --> 2358.50]  I was talking about how resilient the LTT backpack has been.
[2358.50 --> 2367.50]  And he demonstrated this by posting his absolutely abused, like wrecked looking bag that he had
[2367.50 --> 2370.50]  been using for one year.
[2370.50 --> 2371.50]  Yeah.
[2371.50 --> 2377.50]  And naturally a lot of people's response to that was, I'm sorry, you're delighted that
[2377.50 --> 2382.50]  this bag is at one year and still functioning.
[2382.50 --> 2383.50]  And it looks like that.
[2383.50 --> 2386.50]  And he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[2386.50 --> 2387.50]  Hold on.
[2387.50 --> 2392.50]  I work as a miner, but no, a real one like underground.
[2392.50 --> 2395.50]  Um, and it has been through some shit.
[2395.50 --> 2401.50]  Oh, and he said that his previous bags were destroyed in half the time.
[2401.50 --> 2403.50]  So he wasn't actually complaining about it.
[2403.50 --> 2407.50]  And in fact, from my understanding, he intended to continue to use it.
[2407.50 --> 2408.50]  Yeah.
[2408.50 --> 2414.50]  But we saw an opportunity and I think it was actually Chewy, um, from the, from the social
[2414.50 --> 2417.50]  and community team who was like, Hey, how about this?
[2417.50 --> 2418.50]  Can we get that from you?
[2418.50 --> 2424.50]  Why don't we get, why don't we get Frasher a new bag that he can destroy in a year or a
[2424.50 --> 2428.50]  year and a half or however long it takes him because he's apparently a unit.
[2428.50 --> 2436.50]  Um, and why don't we get that one back so we can get what is essentially, um, uh, it's
[2436.50 --> 2437.50]  only one unit.
[2437.50 --> 2444.50]  So it's not perfectly scientific or anything, but, but, uh, but a long-term sort of projection
[2444.50 --> 2447.50]  of, you know, where the wear points might be on our backpack.
[2447.50 --> 2453.50]  If someone were to use it for 10 years or 15 years, um, except Frasher did it for us in
[2453.50 --> 2454.50]  one.
[2454.50 --> 2457.50]  So this is my first time seeing it in person.
[2457.50 --> 2458.00]  Yeah.
[2458.00 --> 2461.00]  Um, Luke, do you, do you want to vent it?
[2461.00 --> 2462.00]  Sure.
[2462.00 --> 2463.00]  Do you want to, do you want to open it?
[2463.00 --> 2464.00]  No, no, you can stay there.
[2464.00 --> 2465.00]  It's just big.
[2465.00 --> 2467.00]  I, here, hold on.
[2467.00 --> 2469.00]  We're gonna, I'm gonna switch to the Luke cam.
[2469.00 --> 2471.00]  I actually really like how it looks so far.
[2471.00 --> 2472.00]  Okay.
[2472.00 --> 2473.00]  Hold on.
[2473.00 --> 2474.00]  Show them, show them the top of the box.
[2474.00 --> 2475.00]  Show them the top of the box.
[2475.00 --> 2476.00]  Wow.
[2476.00 --> 2477.00]  Uh, do, do it.
[2477.00 --> 2479.00]  Does anyone have, I have the Lux bag right now.
[2479.00 --> 2484.00]  Does anyone have a, a regular LTT backpack just for, just for color comparison?
[2484.00 --> 2487.00]  Cause it's like, it's like almost, it's patinaed.
[2487.00 --> 2488.00]  It's brown.
[2488.00 --> 2489.00]  Yeah.
[2489.00 --> 2490.00]  Oh, perfect.
[2490.00 --> 2491.00]  That's tiny.
[2491.00 --> 2492.00]  Is this, is this yours tiny?
[2492.00 --> 2493.00]  Yeah.
[2493.00 --> 2495.00]  Oh, really?
[2495.00 --> 2499.00]  You took the only new carabiners that we have.
[2499.00 --> 2502.00]  Oh, we have an update for you guys on that.
[2502.00 --> 2503.00]  Right?
[2503.00 --> 2504.00]  You're.
[2504.00 --> 2505.00]  Yeah.
[2505.00 --> 2506.00]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[2506.00 --> 2507.00]  There's a, sorry.
[2507.00 --> 2508.00]  Your name tag.
[2508.00 --> 2510.00]  What happened to it?
[2510.00 --> 2511.00]  Oh no.
[2511.00 --> 2512.00]  Oh, okay.
[2512.00 --> 2514.00]  I'm also a product tester, even though I also developed them.
[2514.00 --> 2518.00]  Um, yeah, the, um, that there's an update on them.
[2518.00 --> 2522.00]  I believe the first 50,000 units are going into production very, very shortly.
[2522.00 --> 2528.00]  We've resolved the issue I talked about on the show prior, uh, previously where basically
[2528.00 --> 2533.00]  there was a disagreement over when we owed them more money and I think we're moving forward
[2533.00 --> 2536.00]  and I think things are going to be good and I'm really excited to get those all shipped
[2536.00 --> 2537.00]  out to people.
[2537.00 --> 2538.00]  Okay.
[2538.00 --> 2539.00]  Sorry, Luke.
[2539.00 --> 2541.00]  I had you holding that basically forever while I just dragged my butt.
[2541.00 --> 2542.00]  Okay.
[2542.00 --> 2543.00]  Yeah.
[2543.00 --> 2546.00]  You can, um, you can see a difference.
[2546.00 --> 2547.00]  Yeah.
[2549.00 --> 2550.00]  All right.
[2550.00 --> 2551.00]  Okay, cool.
[2551.00 --> 2552.00]  Here it comes.
[2552.00 --> 2557.00]  Handles and like 100% condition and he was hanging it off of his, like, whatever that vehicle
[2557.00 --> 2558.00]  was that he was using by the handle.
[2558.00 --> 2559.00]  Yeah.
[2559.00 --> 2560.00]  Hey, we accounted for that.
[2560.00 --> 2565.00]  We have not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, but six, six rivets through
[2565.00 --> 2568.00]  the top handle because I knew people would do it.
[2569.00 --> 2575.00]  Every backpack I've ever owned has failed here or here or here.
[2575.00 --> 2578.00]  And this like, it's fine.
[2578.00 --> 2580.00]  It's actually completely fine.
[2581.00 --> 2584.00]  That is kind of, I almost want to do this as like a colorway.
[2584.00 --> 2585.00]  This, yeah, it's kind of cool.
[2585.00 --> 2587.00]  Okay, his carabiner pole died.
[2587.00 --> 2588.00]  Yeah, this zipper pole's gone.
[2588.00 --> 2592.00]  Both of the two at the top have their, the like arms broken off.
[2592.00 --> 2593.00]  Yeah, no, we did.
[2593.00 --> 2594.00]  Okay.
[2594.00 --> 2599.00]  I mean, do you want to, here, here, here, I'm going to switch to the Luke, Luke cam.
[2599.00 --> 2600.00]  Uh, okay.
[2600.00 --> 2601.00]  They can't see you.
[2601.00 --> 2602.00]  Oh, wow.
[2602.00 --> 2604.00]  The inside zipper is struggling a wee bit.
[2604.00 --> 2605.00]  The inside is dirty.
[2605.00 --> 2606.00]  I mean, it's a YKK zipper.
[2606.00 --> 2607.00]  What do you want from me?
[2607.00 --> 2608.00]  Oh, wow.
[2608.00 --> 2610.00]  The inside has been used heavily.
[2610.00 --> 2615.00]  There are some samples on the inside of like, what they mine just as a heads up.
[2615.00 --> 2616.00]  Oh, it is very dirty.
[2616.00 --> 2619.00]  Remember how I said it's been through some shit?
[2619.00 --> 2621.00]  Some shit apparently been through it too.
[2621.00 --> 2623.00]  Oh, oh, what do you got?
[2623.00 --> 2624.00]  What do you got?
[2624.00 --> 2625.00]  I want to see.
[2625.00 --> 2626.00]  Whatever was in this one fell out.
[2626.00 --> 2629.00]  Oh, uh, maybe it was heavy.
[2629.00 --> 2633.00]  I mean, hey, look, it's Ethereum.
[2633.00 --> 2634.00]  Just kidding.
[2634.00 --> 2635.00]  Just kidding.
[2635.00 --> 2636.00]  It's real mining.
[2636.00 --> 2637.00]  It's real mining.
[2637.00 --> 2638.00]  Yeah.
[2638.00 --> 2639.00]  Yeah.
[2639.00 --> 2640.00]  Yeah.
[2640.00 --> 2641.00]  Yeah.
[2641.00 --> 2642.00]  All right.
[2642.00 --> 2643.00]  I mean, it is very dirty.
[2643.00 --> 2644.00]  Yeah, that's fine.
[2644.00 --> 2646.00]  I mean, that's the whole point of this segment is versus was he actually carrying coal in the
[2646.00 --> 2647.00]  backpack?
[2647.00 --> 2652.00]  I mean, it looks like it looks like it presumably if not things covered in it.
[2652.00 --> 2653.00]  Okay.
[2653.00 --> 2654.00]  Yeah, fair enough.
[2654.00 --> 2655.00]  Yeah.
[2655.00 --> 2659.00]  Um, am I allowed to, am I allowed to say where they came from?
[2659.00 --> 2661.00]  I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter, right?
[2661.00 --> 2662.00]  I don't know.
[2662.00 --> 2670.00]  Um, Shoemaker Mines, West Virginia, uh, 265 to 330 million year old coal.
[2670.00 --> 2675.00]  Dude, even, even the like laptop sleeve area.
[2675.00 --> 2677.00]  Oh, I know what my kids are getting for Christmas.
[2677.00 --> 2678.00]  Oh, wait.
[2678.00 --> 2682.00]  That would actually be hilarious.
[2682.00 --> 2684.00]  Forbidden brownie.
[2684.00 --> 2686.00]  Oh my goodness.
[2686.00 --> 2687.00]  Oh, this is.
[2687.00 --> 2690.00]  If you eat one, it feeds you for the rest of your life.
[2690.00 --> 2691.00]  This is so cool.
[2691.00 --> 2693.00]  There's a lot of calories in there.
[2693.00 --> 2698.00]  So are these, so we've got samples from various mines.
[2698.00 --> 2699.00]  Nope.
[2699.00 --> 2700.00]  This is from the same mine.
[2700.00 --> 2701.00]  It's just other more different sample.
[2701.00 --> 2705.00]  Probably so that, oh, I guess this is so multiple people on the team can have them as
[2705.00 --> 2706.00]  a keepsake.
[2706.00 --> 2710.00]  I mean, that's, that kind of, that, that's where my logic brain goes.
[2710.00 --> 2711.00]  Okay.
[2711.00 --> 2712.00]  Check, check this.
[2712.00 --> 2713.00]  Even, so there's the main compartment.
[2713.00 --> 2714.00]  Proceeds to wipe his hands.
[2714.00 --> 2715.00]  There's the main compartment that we saw.
[2715.00 --> 2716.00]  Yeah.
[2716.00 --> 2717.00]  Right.
[2717.00 --> 2718.00]  Yeah.
[2718.00 --> 2719.00]  Yeah.
[2719.00 --> 2720.00]  Even the like laptop compartment.
[2720.00 --> 2721.00]  That is scuffed.
[2721.00 --> 2723.00]  But still in really good shape.
[2723.00 --> 2724.00]  Yeah.
[2724.00 --> 2727.00]  Like it were like, everything's still functional.
[2727.00 --> 2729.00]  Everything's still together.
[2729.00 --> 2730.00]  Okay.
[2730.00 --> 2733.00]  I found one hole in the outside of it.
[2733.00 --> 2734.00]  You found a hole.
[2734.00 --> 2736.00]  Oh, I think it's time to go hole hunting.
[2736.00 --> 2741.00]  What about the, the side pockets?
[2741.00 --> 2743.00]  Like, are they full of stuff too?
[2743.00 --> 2745.00]  A hole you say?
[2745.00 --> 2749.00]  So the zippers are a little rough.
[2749.00 --> 2750.00]  So not a partial?
[2750.00 --> 2751.00]  There's like hole gunk in there, but they're still working.
[2751.00 --> 2752.00]  You didn't find a partial?
[2752.00 --> 2753.00]  You found a hole?
[2753.00 --> 2754.00]  It was a partial.
[2754.00 --> 2755.00]  Oh, a partial hole.
[2755.00 --> 2758.00]  Because of a design choice that we made earlier on.
[2758.00 --> 2759.00]  Uh oh.
[2759.00 --> 2760.00]  Uh oh.
[2760.00 --> 2761.00]  I feel like, uh.
[2761.00 --> 2762.00]  No, it's a good thing.
[2762.00 --> 2763.00]  I feel like things are about to get spicy.
[2763.00 --> 2765.00]  It's a good, it's a good design choice.
[2765.00 --> 2766.00]  Not a bad one.
[2766.00 --> 2768.00]  Oh, okay, cool.
[2768.00 --> 2770.00]  Uh, now I'm stressed.
[2770.00 --> 2771.00]  Where?
[2771.00 --> 2772.00]  Give me a hint.
[2772.00 --> 2773.00]  Okay.
[2773.00 --> 2774.00]  The bottom?
[2774.00 --> 2775.00]  This one?
[2775.00 --> 2776.00]  Yeah.
[2776.00 --> 2777.00]  Is that actually a hole?
[2777.00 --> 2778.00]  Wait, you called that a hole?
[2778.00 --> 2779.00]  Well, it's through the, it's through one layer.
[2779.00 --> 2780.00]  Does it go through?
[2780.00 --> 2781.00]  It's through one layer.
[2781.00 --> 2782.00]  Oh.
[2782.00 --> 2783.00]  Oh.
[2783.00 --> 2784.00]  Okay.
[2784.00 --> 2786.00]  So I think you put the bag down on something hot.
[2786.00 --> 2787.00]  Or sharp.
[2787.00 --> 2788.00]  Or both.
[2788.00 --> 2789.00]  Okay.
[2789.00 --> 2790.00]  Okay, here.
[2790.00 --> 2791.00]  Lift up a little higher.
[2791.00 --> 2792.00]  You're below the, yeah, there we go.
[2792.00 --> 2793.00]  Right there.
[2793.00 --> 2797.00]  Remember when I pointed to all the places that my backpacks have ever failed?
[2797.00 --> 2798.00]  I forgot to mention one.
[2798.00 --> 2802.00]  One of the final places that my backpacks have failed is along the bottom.
[2802.00 --> 2807.00]  Because I'm the kind of person who gets home at the end of the day, takes off my backpack,
[2807.00 --> 2811.00]  grabs it by the handle, swings it along the floor, and chucks it to where it goes.
[2811.00 --> 2816.00]  So my backpacks tend to get worn really hard at the bottom.
[2816.00 --> 2822.00]  Um, a lot of people have noted that our backpack is kind of on the big side, a little on the heavy side when it's empty.
[2822.00 --> 2824.00]  Um, yes.
[2824.00 --> 2827.00]  And part of that was very intentional.
[2827.00 --> 2835.00]  And one of the reasons for it is that the bottom panel, these entire two pieces right here are actually double layered.
[2835.00 --> 2838.00]  So in the event, here, can I have a, can I have a knife?
[2838.00 --> 2839.00]  Anyone got a knife on them?
[2839.00 --> 2841.00]  Do you want to damage it more than it is?
[2841.00 --> 2842.00]  Yeah, yeah, that's, that's fine.
[2842.00 --> 2844.00]  I don't think that should affect our analysis.
[2844.00 --> 2847.00]  Are we still doing the research?
[2847.00 --> 2848.00]  That should be fine.
[2848.00 --> 2849.00]  I think I can cut it.
[2849.00 --> 2851.00]  Are you, uh, contaminating a crime scene?
[2851.00 --> 2852.00]  No, no, no, no, no.
[2852.00 --> 2853.00]  There's no crime.
[2853.00 --> 2854.00]  There's no crime.
[2854.00 --> 2855.00]  Is he ever not?
[2855.00 --> 2856.00]  There's no crime.
[2856.00 --> 2857.00]  Is he ever not?
[2857.00 --> 2858.00]  Okay.
[2858.00 --> 2859.00]  Yeah, let's go for it.
[2859.00 --> 2860.00]  Let's do it.
[2860.00 --> 2861.00]  What's the line?
[2861.00 --> 2862.00]  F*** it.
[2862.00 --> 2863.00]  We'll do it live.
[2863.00 --> 2864.00]  Linus stabbed me.
[2864.00 --> 2865.00]  New title.
[2865.00 --> 2866.00]  Okay.
[2866.00 --> 2867.00]  So let's, uh...
[2867.00 --> 2869.00]  Don't, yeah, go somewhere like far from that one.
[2869.00 --> 2871.00]  Oh, don't go right on the seam.
[2871.00 --> 2872.00]  What?
[2872.00 --> 2873.00]  What do you, I'm not on the seam.
[2873.00 --> 2874.00]  I'm close to it.
[2874.00 --> 2875.00]  Okay.
[2875.00 --> 2877.00]  It's not actually that easy to cut.
[2877.00 --> 2879.00]  There we go.
[2879.00 --> 2884.00]  So theoretically, if our manufacturer is following our instructions...
[2884.00 --> 2887.00]  Oh wait, is it not that one?
[2887.00 --> 2888.00]  Uh oh.
[2888.00 --> 2890.00]  Is it this one?
[2890.00 --> 2893.00]  Maybe it's just the one under the laptop compartment.
[2893.00 --> 2894.00]  Oh God.
[2894.00 --> 2896.00]  This would be awkward.
[2896.00 --> 2898.00]  Cyber truck bulletproof window anyone?
[2898.00 --> 2901.00]  What's the safety committee thought process on what's happening right now?
[2901.00 --> 2902.00]  That's fine.
[2902.00 --> 2903.00]  It's not gonna cut Linus.
[2905.00 --> 2907.00]  Where's my, uh...
[2907.00 --> 2909.00]  Where's my second layer here?
[2909.00 --> 2910.00]  Well then, wait.
[2910.00 --> 2913.00]  Well, why didn't the whole cause a problem?
[2913.00 --> 2916.00]  Okay, we need to investigate this for sure.
[2916.00 --> 2917.00]  Sounds good.
[2918.00 --> 2920.00]  Is it under the foam?
[2920.00 --> 2921.00]  Is it under the foam?
[2921.00 --> 2922.00]  I think so.
[2922.00 --> 2923.00]  Oh.
[2923.00 --> 2925.00]  Can, can I see?
[2925.00 --> 2927.00]  I think you'd have to...
[2927.00 --> 2928.00]  Well, let's keep going.
[2929.00 --> 2932.00]  I think you'd have to like really go and then take the foam out.
[2932.00 --> 2934.00]  Cause the foam is like stuck on something.
[2934.00 --> 2936.00]  Finan's having a good day.
[2936.00 --> 2937.00]  That's fine.
[2937.00 --> 2938.00]  Everything is fine.
[2938.00 --> 2939.00]  Everything is fine.
[2939.00 --> 2941.00]  I'm not sure if I agree.
[2941.00 --> 2944.00]  I think there's definitely some stuff for us to figure out here.
[2944.00 --> 2945.00]  Yep.
[2945.00 --> 2946.00]  Thanks Tyne and good chat.
[2946.00 --> 2948.00]  The backpack is in remarkably good shape.
[2948.00 --> 2949.00]  That much is true.
[2950.00 --> 2955.00]  But that doesn't mean that I am not a little put out right now.
[2955.00 --> 2958.00]  I'm always a little put out but...
[2958.00 --> 2960.00]  Was it that other layer?
[2960.00 --> 2961.00]  Mm-mm.
[2961.00 --> 2962.00]  Ah.
[2962.00 --> 2965.00]  So, we need to get that information to the team.
[2965.00 --> 2966.00]  Yep.
[2966.00 --> 2967.00]  I am covered in cold eyes.
[2967.00 --> 2968.00]  As soon as humanly possible.
[2968.00 --> 2969.00]  For sure.
[2969.00 --> 2972.00]  Thank you very much Tyne and...
[2972.00 --> 2973.00]  Hmm.
[2974.00 --> 2975.00]  Things to explore.
[2975.00 --> 2980.00]  Have I ever told you guys that there's never a dull moment around here?
[2981.00 --> 2982.00]  Yeah.
[2982.00 --> 2984.00]  There is always something.
[2985.00 --> 2986.00]  Anyway.
[2987.00 --> 2989.00]  At least it was hard to stick the knife through it.
[2990.00 --> 2991.00]  Oh.
[2992.00 --> 2993.00]  Hold on one sec.
[2996.00 --> 2997.00]  Yeah.
[2997.00 --> 3006.00]  What I'm actually wondering is if it's double thick.
[3006.00 --> 3009.00]  And if there might have been a bit of a miscommunication there.
[3010.00 --> 3011.00]  Where'd that knife go?
[3012.00 --> 3013.00]  Sorry.
[3013.00 --> 3014.00]  I'm in actual just like...
[3014.00 --> 3015.00]  Do you want me to hold?
[3015.00 --> 3016.00]  Working on stuff mode right now.
[3016.00 --> 3017.00]  No, no.
[3017.00 --> 3018.00]  I'm good.
[3018.00 --> 3019.00]  Thank you.
[3019.00 --> 3020.00]  Sorry.
[3020.00 --> 3022.00]  I'm just gonna put more holes in this Tyne.
[3022.00 --> 3023.00]  I hope that's okay.
[3025.00 --> 3026.00]  I don't think it matters if it's not.
[3027.00 --> 3031.00]  That sounded a lot easier.
[3034.00 --> 3035.00]  It's gonna be really hard to tell.
[3036.00 --> 3037.00]  Okay.
[3037.00 --> 3038.00]  We will look into it.
[3038.00 --> 3039.00]  You'll need a...
[3039.00 --> 3040.00]  Yes, please.
[3040.00 --> 3042.00]  I don't need to tell him what he needs.
[3043.00 --> 3044.00]  I don't know why I even started that.
[3045.00 --> 3046.00]  Alright.
[3046.00 --> 3047.00]  Thanks guys.
[3047.00 --> 3048.00]  Sorry, sorry.
[3048.00 --> 3049.00]  I just...
[3049.00 --> 3050.00]  I see...
[3050.00 --> 3051.00]  I see problems.
[3051.00 --> 3053.00]  I need to learn about them.
[3053.00 --> 3054.00]  And I need to fix them.
[3054.00 --> 3056.00]  And it's as much a compulsion as it is actually...
[3057.00 --> 3059.00]  A practical thing for the business.
[3059.00 --> 3060.00]  One of the problems I have right now is...
[3060.00 --> 3062.00]  I haven't explained about merch messages.
[3062.00 --> 3063.00]  So...
[3063.00 --> 3065.00]  Guys, if you want to interact with the show...
[3065.00 --> 3067.00]  The way to do it is through a merch message.
[3067.00 --> 3069.00]  You can pick up one of our delightful backpacks.
[3069.00 --> 3070.00]  One of our delightful...
[3070.00 --> 3071.00]  Sorry, not this one.
[3071.00 --> 3072.00]  Um...
[3072.00 --> 3073.00]  Thanks, honey.
[3073.00 --> 3075.00]  You don't have to duck that much.
[3075.00 --> 3076.00]  You won't see it.
[3076.00 --> 3078.00]  One of our delightful screwdrivers.
[3078.00 --> 3079.00]  Hold on.
[3079.00 --> 3080.00]  Here's the one we're actually promoting right now.
[3080.00 --> 3082.00]  Ah, it was in my pocket.
[3082.00 --> 3083.00]  There you go.
[3083.00 --> 3085.00]  Got our new retro colorway.
[3085.00 --> 3086.00]  Yeah.
[3086.00 --> 3087.00]  Which is super awesome.
[3087.00 --> 3088.00]  It looks so cool.
[3088.00 --> 3089.00]  Um...
[3089.00 --> 3090.00]  Or whatever else strikes your fancy.
[3090.00 --> 3096.00]  And in the cart, you will see a little box titled merch messages whenever we're live.
[3096.00 --> 3104.00]  So instead of just throwing your money at the screen via Super Chat or Twitch Bits or whatever else, you get to throw your money at the screen and get your order in the mail.
[3104.00 --> 3116.00]  And as a bonus, it will go to producer Dan, who will either forward it to the relevant party internally, reply to it himself, chuck it up at the bottom of the screen so you can do a little shoutout or, you know, send a little message.
[3116.00 --> 3118.00]  Or he will curate it for...
[3118.00 --> 3120.00]  Ha, Tynan's starting investigating already.
[3120.00 --> 3124.00]  Or he will curate it for me and Luke to address on the show.
[3124.00 --> 3130.00]  So to show you guys how it works, Dan is going to pitch us a couple of merch messages to talk about right now.
[3130.00 --> 3131.00]  Yeah, sure.
[3131.00 --> 3132.00]  I've got a couple here.
[3132.00 --> 3133.00]  First one up.
[3133.00 --> 3137.00]  I started a new job as a Dell and Lenovo warranty technician.
[3137.00 --> 3142.00]  I love my new job so far, but I'm afraid that I will upset a customer eventually.
[3142.00 --> 3143.00]  Do you have any advice for me?
[3147.00 --> 3151.00]  I mean, I don't think there's... I don't think there's any way to avoid that.
[3151.00 --> 3153.00]  You're gonna upset a customer eventually.
[3153.00 --> 3154.00]  The customer is not always right.
[3154.00 --> 3156.00]  Some of those will be predetermined as well.
[3156.00 --> 3158.00]  Sometimes the customer is a f***ing idiot.
[3158.00 --> 3161.00]  And sometimes they're just mad already before you even pick up your phone.
[3161.00 --> 3163.00]  Yeah, sometimes it's nothing personal.
[3163.00 --> 3169.00]  I mean, that honestly is probably the best piece of advice I think my aunt ever gave me.
[3169.00 --> 3174.00]  Is that everyone has baggage, is the way that she kind of put it.
[3174.00 --> 3175.00]  And you know what?
[3175.00 --> 3181.00]  Some people have more baggage than other people and carrying it is really tiring for them.
[3181.00 --> 3182.00]  And that's not your fault.
[3182.00 --> 3184.00]  You know, you need to be empathetic.
[3184.00 --> 3188.00]  You need to try your best to understand their position.
[3188.00 --> 3191.00]  But beyond that, it's not your job to carry it.
[3191.00 --> 3193.00]  People will absolutely dump on you though.
[3193.00 --> 3195.00]  But it's not your job to carry their baggage.
[3195.00 --> 3196.00]  Yeah.
[3196.00 --> 3203.00]  And I think that that's probably the best way for you to kind of think about that is, hey, look, this is...
[3203.00 --> 3206.00]  I can't take this personally right now.
[3206.00 --> 3211.00]  I gotta recognize that in good faith, I did my best here.
[3211.00 --> 3213.00]  And maybe I did screw up.
[3213.00 --> 3218.00]  But if we are both trying to get along, you know, the most important thing is trying to reach a resolution.
[3219.00 --> 3223.00]  And getting angry is not gonna change anything about it.
[3223.00 --> 3226.00]  Maybe that person doesn't understand that.
[3226.00 --> 3231.00]  Or maybe they're not in a state of mind right now where they're able to think about it that way.
[3231.00 --> 3237.00]  But whatever the case is, I just gotta recognize that this is not my baggage.
[3237.00 --> 3239.00]  This is not my burden to carry.
[3239.00 --> 3242.00]  And I gotta just keep being me and keep being my best self.
[3242.00 --> 3247.00]  That's what I would recommend.
[3247.00 --> 3248.00]  Because it will happen.
[3248.00 --> 3249.00]  It'll happen.
[3251.00 --> 3254.00]  Hi, LTT Crew from Oklahoma.
[3254.00 --> 3255.00]  What's up?
[3255.00 --> 3260.00]  I was wondering when the Noctua Edition screwdriver would be released and will there possibly be a stubby version?
[3260.00 --> 3261.00]  A stubby version.
[3263.00 --> 3265.00]  We've been asked about additional colorways for stubby.
[3265.00 --> 3272.00]  I think that in the very long term, we'd love to just find a way to handle lots of different colors or whatever.
[3272.00 --> 3274.00]  You could buy a preloaded, you know, hex one.
[3274.00 --> 3279.00]  And it would be, you know, whatever the, like, hex sort of industry standard color is.
[3279.00 --> 3281.00]  Are there colors that correspond?
[3281.00 --> 3283.00]  Hey, Tyna, I can't remember on the screwdrivers.
[3283.00 --> 3286.00]  Is it that the colors correspond to the size or the bit type?
[3286.00 --> 3287.00]  He's gone.
[3287.00 --> 3288.00]  He's gone.
[3288.00 --> 3289.00]  Well, great.
[3289.00 --> 3290.00]  Cool.
[3290.00 --> 3297.00]  Anyway, you know, I would love to have all kinds of, you know, different options or do like fun little drops.
[3297.00 --> 3303.00]  You know, here's 69 Lambo edition ones or whatever, right?
[3303.00 --> 3313.00]  But right now, we have to focus our manufacturing capacity, which if you're regular viewers will know is a lot of it here.
[3313.00 --> 3314.00]  No, not him.
[3314.00 --> 3315.00]  You're not the manufacturing capacity.
[3315.00 --> 3317.00]  No, I have an answer.
[3317.00 --> 3318.00]  Oh, alright.
[3318.00 --> 3320.00]  Red, Phillips screwdriver.
[3320.00 --> 3321.00]  Okay, so it's by bit type.
[3321.00 --> 3324.00]  Blue, Phillips screwdriver often used for electrical work.
[3324.00 --> 3328.00]  Green, Torx screwdriver used for electronics and appliances.
[3328.00 --> 3330.00]  Are you really going to go through this whole thing?
[3330.00 --> 3331.00]  I was going to, yeah.
[3331.00 --> 3332.00]  Sure.
[3332.00 --> 3333.00]  I'm, you know what?
[3333.00 --> 3334.00]  I'm actually here for it.
[3334.00 --> 3335.00]  Yellow, flathead screwdriver.
[3335.00 --> 3337.00]  Black, magnetic screwdriver.
[3337.00 --> 3341.00]  Orange, insulated screwdriver used for electrical work to prevent electrical shock.
[3341.00 --> 3344.00]  And silver, precision screwdriver used for small electronics and devices.
[3344.00 --> 3347.00]  Alright, well, we probably won't be following this key, but we'll do something.
[3347.00 --> 3356.00]  The point is, right now we need to focus our manufacturing capacity on the few SKUs that we're bringing out.
[3356.00 --> 3360.00]  But in the longer term, yeah, we'd love to do all kinds of things.
[3360.00 --> 3370.00]  What I said last time people asked about different colorways on the stubby is, yeah, we'd love to, but we need to see the stubby be a big success in the standard colors.
[3370.00 --> 3379.00]  And then we'll consider bringing in additional colors because your additional colors are always going to be some proportion of what you would sell in black.
[3379.00 --> 3388.00]  Um, I, I have yet to see any evidence, whether it's t-shirts or sweatshirts or screwdrivers or anything.
[3388.00 --> 3394.00]  I've yet to see any evidence to support that some other color will sell more than black.
[3394.00 --> 3397.00]  I want to throw something into the ring.
[3397.00 --> 3399.00]  The swim trunks.
[3399.00 --> 3400.00]  Yes.
[3400.00 --> 3402.00]  Black still outsold?
[3402.00 --> 3403.00]  Uh, you know what?
[3403.00 --> 3410.00]  I would have to go back and look at, uh, I'd have to go back and look at the launch.
[3410.00 --> 3414.00]  And I don't remember when we launched it because we've sold through all of them.
[3414.00 --> 3420.00]  So if I just look at a huge time period, it's just going to say however many we ordered, it was sold.
[3420.00 --> 3422.00]  Um, I feel like that would be the best bet.
[3422.00 --> 3423.00]  Yeah.
[3423.00 --> 3427.00]  If anyone remembers when we launched the swim trunks, I can't look it up right now.
[3427.00 --> 3430.00]  Um, post it in the chat and then I'll, I'll, I'll go find it.
[3430.00 --> 3432.00]  I'll, I'll let you guys know.
[3432.00 --> 3434.00]  All right, Dan hit us.
[3434.00 --> 3435.00]  Sure thing.
[3435.00 --> 3437.00]  Um, love you guys.
[3437.00 --> 3447.00]  Have you heard of sending, uh, HDMI signals through a box of, I guess, ethernet to get high quality audio video over long distances?
[3447.00 --> 3449.00]  No fiber optic wires needed.
[3449.00 --> 3450.00]  HD based T.
[3450.00 --> 3452.00]  Uh, yes.
[3452.00 --> 3453.00]  It's super cool.
[3453.00 --> 3462.00]  We actually did a video showing that, um, the, the title was, uh, quite clickable.
[3462.00 --> 3469.00]  So it might not be the most obvious thing for you guys to find, but I think I remember what I was, what, I think I remember what it was called.
[3469.00 --> 3474.00]  Uh, weirdest graphics card or something like that.
[3474.00 --> 3475.00]  Digital signals are great.
[3475.00 --> 3477.00]  But, but, but, but, but, but.
[3477.00 --> 3478.00]  Yeah.
[3478.00 --> 3479.00]  There it is.
[3479.00 --> 3480.00]  Man, man, I'm good.
[3480.00 --> 3481.00]  Here it is.
[3481.00 --> 3483.00]  This GPU, super cool.
[3483.00 --> 3489.00]  It has ethernet jacks on the back because that function is, functionality is built right into it.
[3489.00 --> 3490.00]  That's cool.
[3490.00 --> 3491.00]  Yeah.
[3491.00 --> 3492.00]  Super neat, right?
[3492.00 --> 3498.00]  I think we still have the six by a hundred meter spool of cable that we use to do the tempo.
[3498.00 --> 3508.00]  Cause it's too valuable to throw away, but it's too impractical to use cause it's like this crazy stiff thick armored cable or something.
[3508.00 --> 3509.00]  I don't know.
[3509.00 --> 3510.00]  Bizarre.
[3510.00 --> 3512.00]  Oh, oh, oh, when, when, uh, knock to a screwdriver.
[3512.00 --> 3517.00]  I think maybe sometime in the.
[3521.00 --> 3522.00]  Nice.
[3522.00 --> 3523.00]  All right.
[3523.00 --> 3524.00]  Is that the three?
[3524.00 --> 3526.00]  No, hold on.
[3526.00 --> 3528.00]  He's, he's looking.
[3528.00 --> 3530.00]  I'm actually looking, but yeah, you can do another one.
[3530.00 --> 3531.00]  You want four?
[3531.00 --> 3532.00]  Sure.
[3532.00 --> 3536.00]  Um, this is just, it's more merch stuff.
[3536.00 --> 3537.00]  Let's see.
[3537.00 --> 3539.00]  Uh, okay.
[3539.00 --> 3541.00]  I got one here for Luke.
[3541.00 --> 3542.00]  Sure.
[3542.00 --> 3543.00]  LLD.
[3543.00 --> 3544.00]  First off.
[3544.00 --> 3545.00]  Hi, Dan.
[3545.00 --> 3546.00]  Hope you're having a great day.
[3546.00 --> 3547.00]  Second off.
[3547.00 --> 3548.00]  Linus go yourself.
[3548.00 --> 3549.00]  Third.
[3549.00 --> 3550.00]  Now that I've got your attention.
[3550.00 --> 3551.00]  Of course I believed it.
[3551.00 --> 3552.00]  Oh, Luke.
[3552.00 --> 3557.00]  Uh, what's the biggest allowed to discuss bug on float plane?
[3557.00 --> 3558.00]  Uh, I hope I believed it.
[3558.00 --> 3559.00]  I've, I test my button.
[3559.00 --> 3560.00]  That's fine.
[3560.00 --> 3563.00]  If I see no evil, I can also neither hear nor speak it.
[3563.00 --> 3564.00]  I don't know.
[3564.00 --> 3565.00]  Uh, I don't know.
[3565.00 --> 3569.00]  Uh, I, I don't feel like it's really been that bad.
[3569.00 --> 3574.00]  Um, we've had a lot of issues with our transcoding system for a really long time, but we're kind
[3574.00 --> 3575.00]  of out of those waters now.
[3575.00 --> 3579.00]  Um, not only did we more or less fix the transcoding system that we have, but the new one, uh, which
[3579.00 --> 3580.00]  is going to be awesome.
[3580.00 --> 3586.00]  We got a lot of issues with our transcoding system for a really long time, but we're kind
[3586.00 --> 3589.00]  of out of those waters now.
[3589.00 --> 3594.00]  Um, not only did we more or less fix the transcoding system that we have, but the new
[3594.00 --> 3599.00]  one, uh, which is going to be awesome, but the new one that was a, that was a big issue earlier
[3599.00 --> 3602.00]  this year, but yeah, I think we're mostly out of that now.
[3602.00 --> 3607.00]  I think that was, that's probably the biggest problem we've had.
[3607.86 --> 3611.32]  That was like long-running. I don't know. Oh speaking of flow plane
[3611.42 --> 3618.36]  We apparently have two flow plane exclusive videos where Tynan talks about the metal screwdriver in more detail and
[3618.54 --> 3623.28]  One where the Creator Warehouse team looks over the mining backpack that one's coming out next Tuesday
[3623.28 --> 3626.76]  So the screwdriver one's already there and then the Creator Warehouse team looked at the backpack
[3626.94 --> 3630.58]  I'm glad they did that before I put a hole in it. Yeah mind you it
[3630.94 --> 3635.12]  Might merit a follow-up video if if depending on what we find well
[3635.12 --> 3637.88]  Well, we'll have to see Tynan ran off with it like right away
[3637.88 --> 3643.12]  So yeah, it doesn't surprise me Tynan Tynan's he's he's good. He takes stuff serious
[3643.24 --> 3649.12]  Yeah, yeah, I mean to be clear when I when I single out Tynan that doesn't necessarily mean that I am
[3649.20 --> 3655.40]  Saying that the rest of the team is not good. You know, it's what I like hamburgers. You hate hot dogs. No, no, no
[3655.40 --> 3657.40]  I love them all
[3658.36 --> 3662.74]  Only one hot dog and one hamburger. I'll do it right now. I like the both at the same time
[3662.74 --> 3664.74]  I
[3664.74 --> 3671.24]  I just mean that doesn't surprise me at all that he immediately went where he has more access to tools
[3671.24 --> 3673.24]  Whatever else
[3673.24 --> 3675.24]  All right, why don't we?
[3675.50 --> 3678.30]  But what do you want to do now? What are we supposed to be doing?
[3678.30 --> 3682.68]  We were asking about the noctuous screwdriver timeline. Oh, right. Yes, I did look that up
[3683.36 --> 3685.74]  Here's the last update that I have from Nick
[3685.74 --> 3691.16]  24,000 people have signed up for a notification when it's in stock
[3691.74 --> 3694.98]  Historically the conversion is obviously not 100% but that's
[3695.74 --> 3696.24]  Good
[3696.24 --> 3701.86]  Boxes are expected to be complete in early December. Then it's just pending shipping
[3702.24 --> 3704.24]  of boxes and
[3704.74 --> 3705.74]  Screwdrivers maybe
[3706.24 --> 3709.24]  No, I'm not sure maybe the screwdrivers are done
[3709.24 --> 3715.24]  Boxes for sure that we need to get that done. Yeah, so you will not be getting an octa screwdriver for Christmas, which is unfortunate
[3715.24 --> 3727.94]  What are you doing because they look so cool?
[3730.24 --> 3735.42]  These are my these are my hex my metric my imperial hex way you have a
[3736.54 --> 3741.68]  This is my standard bit set. I never thought about doing that. Oh my gosh
[3742.82 --> 3744.82]  Torx I
[3744.82 --> 3749.44]  I still I still really like the custom screwdriver that you and I made that one night. I
[3750.10 --> 3754.94]  Love it. We made one that looks like a toy. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's actually awesome
[3754.94 --> 3758.76]  Yeah, it's every time I use it at home. I'm like this is sweet. This is dope
[3759.32 --> 3764.22]  There's no you can never get like really high quality products in that type of a color scheme
[3764.80 --> 3769.48]  Like it actually looks like a kid's toy, but then it's a yeah, it's it's great. I love it
[3769.60 --> 3772.98]  We would love in the longer term to have a
[3772.98 --> 3775.60]  Byos, you know build your own screwdriver
[3775.60 --> 3776.60]  You know build your own screwdriver
[3776.60 --> 3777.60]  Configure it thing
[3777.60 --> 3786.52]  I think that it's something we may be able to achieve at some point I haven't talked about this much but we have fixed shaft screwdrivers coming
[3786.52 --> 3789.14]  Oh, there's been a ton of work
[3789.14 --> 3796.20]  Robert from the creator warehouse team has been heading that up and it's more challenging than you would think because we are not
[3796.60 --> 3803.76]  Just taking some screwdriver set from some factory and silk screening our logo on it. That's not good enough for us
[3803.76 --> 3807.38]  We are creating something really special
[3807.38 --> 3809.38]  we are
[3809.38 --> 3812.06]  We're we're going to be using a very similar
[3812.92 --> 3816.32]  Ergonomic shape compared like compared to our ratcheting driver
[3816.32 --> 3824.54]  But obviously the shafts are going to be thinner so that you can get into places that a multi bit screwdriver simply can't get me if it
[3824.54 --> 3827.86]  They won't ratchet they're going to have an overgrip
[3828.44 --> 3833.32]  Because we don't have to fit all the bits inside so there's enough room to do
[3833.88 --> 3835.88]  a multi mold process
[3835.88 --> 3842.20]  So we'll have like a harder hard inner mold and then a softer outer mold, but not soft soft
[3842.20 --> 3848.48]  We want something that's like, you know got a little bit of grip to it feels nice in the hand, but is not going to wear out
[3849.10 --> 3851.10]  we're going to have
[3851.44 --> 3853.44]  these little kind of
[3855.82 --> 3861.72]  Butt plugs well they go on the butt of the screwdriver and they're a plug so they're end plugs and plug let's call them end plugs
[3862.20 --> 3864.20]  They plug into the edge
[3866.26 --> 3869.88]  So we'll have these end plugs that are going to be modular and
[3869.88 --> 3877.34]  And the reason for that is not because you will even not because you will want to or even be able to take them out
[3878.26 --> 3885.32]  But because the idea is that we are going to have the final assembly of the screwdrivers be
[3885.76 --> 3887.38]  somewhat modular oh I
[3887.80 --> 3889.80]  believe we are leaning towards
[3890.10 --> 3891.60]  forged
[3891.60 --> 3898.96]  Forged shafts there's trying to think if there's like anything else to really say about it, but the cool thing about the way that we're
[3898.96 --> 3903.72]  Developing this product is that we're going to only warehouse
[3904.78 --> 3906.78]  shafts
[3906.78 --> 3907.78]  handles and
[3908.44 --> 3913.26]  End plugs so the idea is that if you
[3914.38 --> 3917.84]  Wanted a longer shaft or if you wanted
[3918.52 --> 3924.34]  A number one Phillips with a bigger handle or a smaller handle we're gonna have five different handle sizes
[3924.34 --> 3929.16]  Or if you wanted to customize a fixed screwdriver as well
[3929.84 --> 3933.16]  Exactly so you could kind of create your own ultimate
[3934.50 --> 3936.50]  fixed shaft screwdriver set
[3937.12 --> 3944.16]  For your needs and have it match all your other screwdrivers assuming that you just get them all from LTT store and there would be no reason
[3944.16 --> 3946.16]  Not to because they're going to be flipping awesome
[3947.56 --> 3955.52]  The the smallest handle size is kind of down to almost precision territory because remember we do have a precision driver coming for that really fine work and
[3955.52 --> 3957.64]  then the biggest one is actually
[3958.56 --> 3963.98]  Bigger than this one. It's like like you know like a like a number three flathead
[3963.98 --> 3967.52]  You know like like the handle on one of those
[3968.36 --> 3974.02]  You know the manufacturer says don't use it as a pry bar, but like it can do it
[3974.58 --> 3977.44]  What else are any what else is anybody doing with these screwdrivers?
[3977.98 --> 3979.98]  oh
[3980.72 --> 3983.66]  Are we still alive what?
[3984.38 --> 3986.38]  Twitch chat saying F
[3987.42 --> 3989.42]  Alright cool anyway
[3989.42 --> 3994.80]  Really excited about those I forget what the point of what I was talking about was but
[3995.40 --> 3997.40]  It's gonna be great
[3999.18 --> 4004.18]  What are we supposed to oh yeah topics are they hot ones oh
[4005.74 --> 4010.06]  Oh, man, okay. This is really turning into the merch show, but Dan
[4012.18 --> 4014.18]  Not you
[4014.30 --> 4016.30]  Producer of the h3 podcast
[4016.30 --> 4022.92]  Ironically, yeah, I was like what every every podcast has a Dan. Yeah, they're all named Dan. Oh
[4023.86 --> 4027.86]  Recently called the LTT screwdriver. Hey, do do they have my audio?
[4028.86 --> 4035.16]  They should they they can is that is that oh on your laptop? Sorry. Is that a thing that can be had?
[4038.22 --> 4042.66]  From you I got it now ready you got it now. Yeah, okay here we go here we go here we go here we go
[4042.66 --> 4046.04]  Do you want to be able to hear it? All right? Yes good
[4046.62 --> 4049.34]  Let me see if I can get through it to you you're gonna hear some slapback though
[4051.58 --> 4053.58]  Okay play
[4055.26 --> 4062.12]  Are you playing it I'm not I'm not getting audio from you then okay. Oh really yeah, I was the last time
[4062.12 --> 4068.18]  Oh wow, I definitely hear what you're calling slapback. Yeah, that is uh, it's muted in the player pretty rough
[4068.18 --> 4073.14]  Is it I think so there's your problem right there. All right, cool ready? Mm-hmm
[4077.14 --> 4082.34]  No, I wonder I wonder if they're Dan versus our Dan, you know
[4082.82 --> 4086.30]  Their Dan would be able to get audio to the host. You know, no, no, you're not sending me audio
[4086.30 --> 4088.30]  You're doing a great job to play the video
[4088.30 --> 4092.10]  Oh, by the way, yeah now now we're hearing it you're not
[4095.98 --> 4097.98]  Take it
[4097.98 --> 4101.98]  You got it. I'm out of them. Yeah, people are mad at them. You still have pretty quiet
[4102.86 --> 4104.86]  Listen just chill
[4109.74 --> 4114.54]  Okay, hold on hold on okay, I have an idea I have an idea you're gonna hate it
[4114.54 --> 4116.54]  Are you ready for this? I
[4118.54 --> 4120.78]  I've got it now. No sure you can play it now
[4122.30 --> 4125.88]  She's I was just gonna hold my phone up to the money. She's gonna threaten them with that
[4126.30 --> 4131.62]  Yeah, it's amazing how quickly he'll figure it out when you when you when you offer up a janky solution
[4131.62 --> 4133.62]  I'm gonna plug in a go out slar Dan
[4133.90 --> 4136.72]  Okay, ready mm-hmm. Oh, by the way shout out
[4137.38 --> 4139.88]  Quiet your side hips or maybe not are they?
[4140.60 --> 4142.60]  Canceled I mean they had a happen
[4142.60 --> 4144.60]  I'm not in that world happened to Linus
[4145.24 --> 4150.42]  You some people are mad at them now people are mad at them. He still has credentials though. I'm not out listen
[4152.02 --> 4158.42]  So the only influencer product I've ever bought in my life really is Linus's screwdriver and this genuinely is
[4158.96 --> 4164.94]  Such an awesome screw what's so good about it. Just really well made. It's a ratchet screwdriver, so
[4165.48 --> 4171.44]  This man is selling screwdrivers. He's selling screwdrivers and then in the bottom. It's got oh that it's in there
[4171.44 --> 4173.44]  I've never seen that
[4173.44 --> 4175.04]  Pretty slick nice
[4175.04 --> 4177.04]  So yes, this is an official
[4177.50 --> 4179.50]  Linus tech tips
[4179.72 --> 4181.72]  Collaboration here. Thank you, Linus
[4183.38 --> 4188.06]  Sweet heck yeah, is he building a computer? I don't know doesn't matter so cool
[4188.06 --> 4190.32]  You don't have to build a computer with the LTT screwdriver you do anything
[4190.32 --> 4195.68]  It's actually when you try to do something else. There's like a bar bar that comes up. It's incompatible
[4196.64 --> 4198.70]  You should try it out buy one test it
[4200.70 --> 4206.14]  Really like the idea buying four or five to store all their different bit types in I am definitely doing that
[4206.64 --> 4211.88]  That is a genius idea. I never thought about doing the flex. I when did you think of doing that? Oh
[4211.88 --> 4216.68]  Oh immediately I just had to wait for us to make more colors of it
[4216.92 --> 4222.96]  Why didn't I yeah you should advertise that on the store. Oh my goodness. Well like like I said, I want it
[4222.96 --> 4225.92]  Yeah, of course I want to do that, you know just have like do a four pack
[4225.98 --> 4231.68]  Yeah, you can buy a set and they're all different colors so you can immediately go straight to the right set of bits right because
[4232.80 --> 4239.38]  16 bits or excuse me 12 bits. That's that's not enough for me, you know as an owner of four or five
[4239.38 --> 4241.38]  I will be doing this immediately
[4244.02 --> 4246.52]  Yeah, I mean even if you have all all the same color ones
[4246.52 --> 4250.58]  You could just put like a thing of tape around them or whatever else and then they're color-coded boom you're good
[4251.30 --> 4256.54]  Apparently people in flow plane chat say I'm wrong because they they use it for things other than building computers
[4256.54 --> 4260.94]  But I still think you should well they could be lying. They're biased. Yeah, they're the most hardcore
[4260.94 --> 4264.48]  Yeah, you guys should you should still test it. Okay. All right. Let's
[4265.28 --> 4269.14]  Let's talk about fake women who got a conference canceled. Yeah
[4269.38 --> 4275.52]  Yeah, yeah, yeah way to go fake women online developer conference Devternity
[4277.22 --> 4278.02]  Is that correct?
[4278.02 --> 4286.26]  eternity sure has been cancelled after several tech executives withdrew as speakers citing the revelation that its organizer
[4287.06 --> 4289.06]  Edwards
[4289.06 --> 4296.90]  Has apparently been making up fake female professionals to list as speakers at his conferences including fake biographies
[4297.86 --> 4298.66]  credentials
[4298.66 --> 4311.22]  photos and social media accounts the motivation seems to have been to trick male speakers who would otherwise refuse to attend on the grounds that the speaker list was not inclusive the conference was scheduled to have over a
[4311.22 --> 4318.10]  A thousand attendees with admittance costing from four hundred and thirty five dollars to eight hundred and seventy dollars some of these dev conferences are
[4318.82 --> 4319.36]  Really?
[4319.36 --> 4319.86]  Wow
[4319.86 --> 4323.78]  Yeah, that's wild at least one of the fake women
[4324.26 --> 4325.22]  Julia
[4325.22 --> 4327.30]  Cursina appears to be a direct
[4327.94 --> 4334.82]  sock puppet and her social media accounts frequently post the same content as the organizers own accounts verbatim
[4334.82 --> 4339.78]  Albeit with the addition of flirtatious photos and emojis very cool
[4340.58 --> 4342.58]  Uh her posts go back to 2019
[4343.70 --> 4348.18]  The organizer claims that the second fake female speaker anna boyco
[4348.58 --> 4355.46]  Was a demo persona from their test website that was mistakenly included in the speaker list. Yeah, sure, whatever
[4356.10 --> 4362.90]  Uh, he further stated this year despite our attempts we've achieved a worse than expected level of diversity of speakers
[4363.30 --> 4368.58]  There have been thousands of events chasing the same small subgroup of female speakers
[4369.54 --> 4372.10]  Okay, now hold on a second. Can we pause for a minute here?
[4373.86 --> 4375.86]  Find a different one
[4375.86 --> 4381.46]  Find a different what sorry like woman to speak at your event. Oh, uh, yeah
[4382.02 --> 4383.62]  I think his point is that there isn't enough
[4383.62 --> 4387.94]  Okay, so then making up fake ones is the solution?
[4387.94 --> 4388.98]  Yeah, I don't know
[4389.62 --> 4395.30]  Uh, one reason why this may have gone unnoticed at previous events is because of the relatively low number of
[4395.86 --> 4403.46]  Women both fake and real attending these conferences only four women were supposed to speak at devternity and only two
[4404.58 --> 4405.62]  appear to be fake
[4406.26 --> 4410.34]  Um further only two appear to be real. I guess is what that meant was meant to be read
[4410.34 --> 4417.22]  Yeah, I mean it's true either way. So hold on. Sorry. I i i'm gonna let you finish but um
[4417.78 --> 4419.78]  Was he not expecting people to notice?
[4420.66 --> 4426.58]  I'm assuming you just call like a last minute call out situation. Is this is is that the real takeaway here?
[4426.90 --> 4429.22]  That he's been pulling this con for years
[4430.66 --> 4432.34]  pun intended
[4432.34 --> 4433.22]  and
[4433.22 --> 4440.18]  No one has gone. Yeah, wow. No one has gone. Wow. I saw her on the speaker list
[4440.58 --> 4442.58]  I want to see her talk. Wait a minute
[4443.30 --> 4444.82]  Where is she?
[4444.82 --> 4448.26]  And figured this out before so is that the actual problem?
[4448.66 --> 4452.50]  Well, well, no, so okay as I expected reading reading forward
[4452.50 --> 4454.50]  uh
[4456.42 --> 4458.82]  One of the real women dropped out due to medical issues
[4458.82 --> 4460.50]  Okay, so they actually only had one real one
[4460.50 --> 4465.46]  And in previous years it appears that the small number of fake professionals would cancel at the last minute
[4465.70 --> 4471.86]  Which would appear to the observers as a coincidence rather than deliberate fraud. So yeah, they would just have them cancel
[4472.10 --> 4477.06]  And then they don't be like oh, sorry guys. Not all the panel presenters are able to make it
[4478.42 --> 4482.82]  And then you just have but most of them do and you paid a thousand dollars to come here anyways
[4483.70 --> 4485.06]  so hope you enjoy the
[4486.02 --> 4489.46]  Snacks, I don't know wow. Okay our discussion question
[4489.86 --> 4490.74]  um
[4490.74 --> 4495.46]  While organizers clearly shouldn't be making up fake speakers for the sake of appearances
[4496.34 --> 4500.42]  Is there a genuine supply issue when it comes to prominent female speakers in tech?
[4500.42 --> 4506.26]  Okay, so this there's two answers to this right when it comes to prominent female speakers in tech. I mean
[4507.54 --> 4512.26]  Yeah, like you could obviously find them, you know, dr. Lisa sue or something
[4512.26 --> 4514.82]  But does she want to talk at your event or is she busy?
[4515.46 --> 4520.50]  Is she busy kicking the ass of a company that's ten times their size? Yeah, not even development anyway
[4520.90 --> 4524.90]  So are there prominent, you know women in tech sure? Yes
[4526.34 --> 4533.30]  Are they busy? Maybe do all but then come talk at your freaking event should someone else have an opportunity and is
[4533.94 --> 4537.70]  is it possible that you know the other ones don't want to speak at your event because
[4537.70 --> 4547.22]  It's like uh, it's almost like a like a chicken and egg thing like do they feel I wouldn't be too surprised if there was like um
[4548.50 --> 4550.10]  Some camaraderie
[4550.10 --> 4551.46]  amongst the
[4551.46 --> 4556.18]  Female presenters that do these events and they might communicate about what events are cool
[4556.74 --> 4558.34]  Yeah, I could see that
[4558.34 --> 4562.50]  I don't i'm not I have no idea but it just kind of makes sense to me
[4562.50 --> 4563.70]  um
[4563.70 --> 4567.86]  Creators talk, you know, i'm sure it's not that different for um
[4568.74 --> 4569.22]  people that
[4570.18 --> 4572.18]  Host events talking events stuff like that
[4572.18 --> 4575.54]  Schraf 2k says so tired of the sue simping
[4576.26 --> 4577.22]  Well, then you know
[4578.74 --> 4585.22]  Maybe sorry next time he'll be into leather jackets and expensive kitchens like yeah, maybe intel should try, you know
[4585.94 --> 4587.94]  being competitive
[4588.26 --> 4590.26]  I mean it's an idea it's an idea
[4590.58 --> 4595.22]  What it's it's why would you laugh that's a that's a real idea that's good. Maybe you should talk
[4595.78 --> 4596.58]  You know what?
[4596.58 --> 4598.58]  No, i'm gonna call them right now
[4598.82 --> 4604.74]  You can say look if you don't want us to talk about how great amd is doing under the leadership of dr sue then
[4606.02 --> 4610.66]  Maybe you should compete better. Yeah, okay. Hold on. Let me just good idea
[4610.90 --> 4611.86]  um
[4611.86 --> 4613.14]  in
[4613.14 --> 4616.42]  And i mean it's all numbers. How do I how do I dial intel?
[4618.42 --> 4620.42]  T9
[4620.42 --> 4622.42]  Role-playing is a boomer
[4623.70 --> 4630.26]  Oh, man, anyway, um, you know, I gotta admit I don't I don't have solutions to these problems. I um
[4630.82 --> 4637.94]  Yeah, I I want there to be them but like oh, I just got added. I I organize a conference. Yes
[4637.94 --> 4639.94]  Apparently it's a thing
[4640.82 --> 4641.94]  Added to what?
[4641.94 --> 4648.82]  Uh, no, they like at oh added. Oh, you're role-playing as boomer. Sorry. Yes. Yes. What I I don't remember what the question was
[4648.82 --> 4652.34]  My like they they probably talk to each other about what events are cool. Oh, yeah, okay
[4652.90 --> 4654.90]  That wasn't really a question. Yeah, um
[4655.38 --> 4657.70]  Okay, yeah, pokimane's a prominent woman in
[4658.26 --> 4662.82]  Gaming not tech. Yeah, this is a developer conference. This is like you know what?
[4662.82 --> 4667.22]  This is like when people when people say that and she probably doesn't want to go talk there anyway
[4667.22 --> 4669.46]  This is like when people say that I run a tech company
[4670.26 --> 4677.30]  Yeah, I mean you do well, okay, that's a different company. I mean, I'm he runs a clothing company
[4677.30 --> 4679.30]  You still run it
[4679.46 --> 4680.98]  Stop
[4680.98 --> 4684.66]  But that's not what they're talking about. That's like when people say accurate things about me
[4685.78 --> 4687.78]  No, no, they don't
[4688.50 --> 4690.50]  Linus liked hamburgers
[4690.50 --> 4694.90]  I'm going to twitter right now. I mean x. I mean tell them all
[4695.78 --> 4698.02]  Oh, man. Okay. Okay. Okay. The point is
[4698.82 --> 4704.90]  When people are referring to linus media group, I know and they say that I run a tech company
[4705.14 --> 4711.22]  Seriously, the number of people that have made business pitches to me, you know saying that I could you know
[4711.70 --> 4716.90]  Help assist them or asking if I have any you know advice for their tech startup. I'm sitting here going
[4716.90 --> 4723.62]  I literally it has the okay. I put my own name in the name
[4724.26 --> 4726.18]  Okay, I put everyone else in the name
[4726.98 --> 4732.66]  And I put and then I put media in the name. How can I be more explicit?
[4732.66 --> 4734.98]  Yeah, but you'd literally had a software startup
[4735.62 --> 4737.38]  Yeah, I know
[4737.38 --> 4739.38]  I mean
[4740.82 --> 4743.54]  Did I have it start up or did I have it just kind of float there?
[4744.42 --> 4745.70]  Wow, boom roasted
[4746.50 --> 4750.98]  I mean, I was told when we were starting it like you know when you guys are ready. I'm so excited
[4751.14 --> 4754.74]  I'm gonna I'm gonna like do the business side of this and then I wanted to
[4755.30 --> 4757.22]  Yeah, it's really busy
[4757.22 --> 4766.82]  Oh, man, I mean in fairness to float plane guys the tech is super cool
[4766.82 --> 4772.42]  It is very good and the supporters over there are absolutely amazing shout out float plane chat right now
[4773.46 --> 4781.06]  Um, it is self-sufficient and i've told luke this before float plane did what I thought was impossible
[4781.06 --> 4785.38]  Uh float plane built a completely self-funded
[4785.94 --> 4793.54]  Dev team within our company that has allowed us to do all kinds of incredible things many of which you haven't seen yet
[4794.10 --> 4797.22]  But you will you will someday and it's
[4797.94 --> 4803.86]  Awesome and all of it all of it is possible because of the float plane supporters that we have so
[4804.66 --> 4809.62]  You know what shout out you guys you are the real mvp dank pod likes he likes it a lot
[4809.62 --> 4815.94]  Thank pods is he's a he's a fan. Yeah, we legitimately do have actual creators on the platform other than ourselves as well
[4816.18 --> 4818.18]  Yeah, it's just they have to be
[4818.34 --> 4820.02]  realistic creators
[4820.02 --> 4826.10]  That understand and appreciate the value of float plane the value is not that you're going to get the best possible revenue split because
[4826.74 --> 4832.26]  That's not how this works. We are self-funded. We have to we're privately held. We have to actually make money
[4832.26 --> 4839.46]  This is not just we can burn vc money. We just create a large user base without caring about sustainability
[4839.46 --> 4846.42]  Our our our revenue share is I believe competitive with uh youtube memberships and and with twitch
[4847.22 --> 4853.94]  But compared to some other services that for example don't pay for their own video hosting. Yeah, it's not going to look as competitive
[4854.66 --> 4857.94]  But the difference is that we're never going to rug pull you because it's sustainable
[4858.50 --> 4860.98]  Right, so we have a new channel on the platform, too
[4861.06 --> 4864.02]  And there's really cool stuff. Okay. I'm going to hear about that in a second
[4864.02 --> 4870.02]  And there's really cool stuff about the platform that not everyone appreciates not everybody cares that
[4870.58 --> 4872.58]  You know the sound quality is better
[4873.22 --> 4877.30]  Dang pods does it's very nice on stream matters a lot to him. Yeah, especially when he's streaming
[4878.90 --> 4883.78]  It's really hard to have a drum stream sound good when your audio is all compressed to heck
[4884.26 --> 4887.70]  We don't even necessarily know why we didn't do a lot for that
[4887.70 --> 4893.14]  Well, yeah, people come to the stream all the time and they're like it's great. It's like okay, but look that's exactly it
[4893.14 --> 4899.78]  We don't do anything. I mean, I'll take it. We didn't kill it. Yeah, sometimes that's all you have to do is not make it worse actively
[4901.62 --> 4907.14]  We get comments about that like literally all the time and it's it's always surprising to me. I don't watch a lot of streams though
[4907.38 --> 4909.38]  So like
[4910.90 --> 4918.42]  Do we have any idea why the twitch stream keeps going down because flow plane's not and youtube's not if youtube and flow plane are not then like
[4918.98 --> 4921.38]  Mm. Oh, that's weird. Yeah, James channel
[4921.38 --> 4924.90]  James channel is now on flow plane
[4926.02 --> 4932.50]  You might recognize that reference. Maybe I don't know possibly if you have watched uh
[4934.02 --> 4941.70]  What is it called on youtube? It's it's the trash networks car channel, which I believe is garbage time
[4941.70 --> 4942.74]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[4942.74 --> 4946.82]  Yeah, there we go. So garbage time he's the he's the mechanic for
[4947.46 --> 4950.66]  Dank pods on garbage time and now he has his own channel on
[4951.22 --> 4956.26]  Flow plane. Oh super cool doing stuff with video games. I am apparently not subscribed yet
[4956.66 --> 4960.26]  Old video games retro video games super cool checking out
[4961.06 --> 4962.98]  electronics brand new release from mcdonald's
[4963.78 --> 4969.46]  Heck yeah, I mean yeah, it's definitely gotta yeah. These guys have a vibe. They got a stick. Yeah
[4969.46 --> 4974.58]  Oh, I wonder if i'm allowed to you know what uh
[4975.46 --> 4978.10]  I'm i'm going for it. I'm going for it. Um
[4979.54 --> 4986.10]  Did you know that someone is traveling is that is that can't subscribe? Oh, yeah, he has no public. Yeah, apparently we're hanging out
[4986.10 --> 4988.10]  Is that common knowledge?
[4988.10 --> 4995.86]  So I was like oh, uh sure yeah dank pods coming to town. Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be great sick
[4996.10 --> 4997.86]  Yeah, cuz something we made our own headphones
[4998.50 --> 5004.74]  He's gonna he's gonna help us. Uh, he's gonna help us review them. No, no, I don't mean we developed a product. Okay. I mean we made headphones
[5005.86 --> 5010.66]  It's gonna be good. Adam was involved. So uh, you you know that the build quality is gonna be
[5011.54 --> 5014.34]  On par with what adam and I built
[5015.06 --> 5018.98]  I love uh, I was told I was told to set james channels channel public
[5019.30 --> 5022.42]  Um, and it's there and you can see it and you can see all the content, but you
[5023.30 --> 5026.66]  He didn't set up any plans. So you can't subscribe
[5029.06 --> 5031.38]  So i'm gonna have to tell him to go in and set some plans
[5034.10 --> 5036.10]  Nice job onboarding there luke
[5036.10 --> 5038.10]  I
[5038.10 --> 5040.82]  Did what I could they guys they gotta set up the plans
[5041.06 --> 5045.54]  I mean if 100 of the users you onboarded this week screwed it up, then is it really on them?
[5045.86 --> 5048.34]  Yeah, that's a good point. That is honestly a pretty good point
[5050.74 --> 5057.46]  Uh, okay another topic I want to talk about the dbrand case to fight situation
[5058.26 --> 5060.26]  All right, so this source one is
[5061.38 --> 5063.38]  One is on twitter twitter
[5063.38 --> 5065.38]  Ooh
[5066.50 --> 5067.86]  Mango parade
[5068.90 --> 5069.78]  At dbrand
[5070.34 --> 5071.78]  I work at best buy
[5072.42 --> 5078.98]  Got an internal notice that case defies rip off products are being recalled countrywide
[5080.34 --> 5082.18]  Don't sell recall
[5082.82 --> 5083.38]  withdrawn
[5084.34 --> 5086.34]  iPhone 14 pro case defy
[5086.98 --> 5092.50]  Oh, interesting. I wonder if this is best buys own initiative or if this is
[5093.22 --> 5100.98]  Case defy trying to get these things back. What is that text? Don't sell dash recall slash misspelling of withdrawn don't sell
[5101.94 --> 5103.94]  recall slash withdrawn
[5104.18 --> 5106.34]  yeah, okay, um, all right
[5107.06 --> 5109.06]  case defy says it is
[5109.70 --> 5116.58]  Investigating the allegations of copyright infringement leveled by dbrand and zach from jerry rig everything as well as a
[5116.58 --> 5121.22]  A ddos attack that disrupted our website when the allegation surfaced
[5124.02 --> 5124.26]  Um
[5124.26 --> 5127.62]  Are you really expecting sympathy right now?
[5129.14 --> 5129.62]  Also
[5130.58 --> 5131.14]  pro tip
[5131.14 --> 5135.14]  Don't complain about a ddos
[5136.10 --> 5138.10]  oh
[5138.98 --> 5144.26]  I did think like what are you gonna what are you gonna come up with with your investigation if I was gonna write a manual?
[5144.26 --> 5146.26]  Okay
[5146.26 --> 5148.26]  If I was gonna write a manual
[5148.26 --> 5150.26]  Leave that bear alone
[5150.26 --> 5152.26]  for how to not
[5152.26 --> 5153.70]  For how to not
[5153.70 --> 5154.90]  Not get ddos
[5155.54 --> 5156.66]  It would be to say
[5156.66 --> 5157.62]  No, it's just
[5157.62 --> 5157.70]  No, it's just
[5157.70 --> 5158.18]  No, it's just
[5158.18 --> 5158.82]  No, it's just
[5158.82 --> 5159.38]  No, it's just
[5159.38 --> 5159.78]  No, it's just
[5161.62 --> 5162.18]  That would be
[5162.74 --> 5164.58]  No, that would be step one in the manual
[5166.34 --> 5166.82]  Oh boy
[5166.82 --> 5168.42]  It made me so sad
[5168.42 --> 5176.18]  But yeah, my thing is like what they think they're gonna come up with like it was definitely dbrand who ddos'd us like
[5176.18 --> 5178.10]  What do they what do they think this is gonna result in?
[5178.10 --> 5180.10]  No, it wasn't
[5180.10 --> 5180.50]  uh
[5180.50 --> 5182.10]  Yeah
[5182.10 --> 5182.74]  Um
[5182.74 --> 5189.30]  They claim that case defy has always been a bastion of originality and they hold pride in that that's cool
[5189.86 --> 5190.66]  um
[5190.66 --> 5194.10]  Dbrand has been one heck of a cannon the whole time, so I think it makes sense
[5194.82 --> 5196.82]  and
[5197.70 --> 5198.02]  Really?
[5198.58 --> 5199.86]  Cannons attacking bastions?
[5199.86 --> 5200.98]  They do like to send it
[5200.98 --> 5201.46]  um
[5202.10 --> 5206.50]  Case defy withdrew its line of inside out cases from sale on its own site last week
[5206.50 --> 5209.86]  But they were still available for sale in person and online via best buy this week
[5209.86 --> 5212.74]  Yeah, I suspect it was case defy that called the pack
[5212.74 --> 5213.86]  That kind of makes sense
[5214.50 --> 5214.82]  um
[5216.58 --> 5218.26]  Our discussion question this is great
[5219.46 --> 5226.26]  Who the hell begins their copyright claim investigation with we have always been a bastion of originality
[5226.66 --> 5231.06]  When the legend I added this part alleged crime is this obvious
[5231.86 --> 5233.30]  the guilty case defy
[5235.70 --> 5237.30]  That's the full list the allegedly
[5237.30 --> 5237.86]  That's the
[5240.90 --> 5245.78]  This is this is brutal dude. Yeah, this is absolutely brutal. I can't I can't sure is
[5246.42 --> 5249.62]  I mean here's the thing. I I think if they apologize
[5250.18 --> 5253.94]  It's an admission of guilt. Whereas if they don't they can still fight it
[5253.94 --> 5255.14]  Hmm
[5255.14 --> 5260.74]  So that's like I I don't know exactly how the legal system works even here. I haven't
[5261.46 --> 5263.70]  Really been embroiled in a lot of legal troubles
[5265.70 --> 5266.02]  um
[5266.02 --> 5267.78]  Anyway
[5267.78 --> 5272.58]  Um, and I especially don't know how the legal system works in other jurisdictions
[5273.54 --> 5275.46]  But my understanding is that
[5275.94 --> 5279.54]  Uh, you know anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
[5279.54 --> 5281.14]  And if they were to say something like we're sorry
[5281.14 --> 5283.86]  We infringed on you. Let's we'll we're gonna pull them down now
[5284.50 --> 5286.98]  Then if dbrand and zach were not
[5287.46 --> 5289.14]  Just all like okay, we chill now
[5290.26 --> 5293.86]  Then their case would become even more open shut than it already appears to be
[5294.42 --> 5298.58]  So I I doubt they have a choice with respect to you know
[5299.22 --> 5301.94]  Apologizing and admitting their errors
[5302.42 --> 5305.94]  um at least from like uh protecting themselves from legal damages
[5305.94 --> 5311.70]  standpoint, but they definitely didn't have to say that they were a bastion of originality
[5316.18 --> 5317.94]  So I guess that's where we're at on that
[5321.22 --> 5327.46]  Oh interesting in ontario there apparently is an apology act which is the kind of thing you would have in canada
[5328.18 --> 5329.70]  which
[5329.78 --> 5334.26]  Makes it so that saying sorry isn't an admission of guilt hashtag sorry
[5334.26 --> 5338.50]  I mean remember that this is this is canada this is this is canada here, okay?
[5339.22 --> 5345.78]  So sorry is just it's we bump into other people at the airport and we're like or sorry other people bump into us at the airport
[5345.78 --> 5347.70]  And we're like sorry, sorry, sorry
[5347.70 --> 5349.70]  Sorry for being in your way
[5349.86 --> 5355.06]  In the way of you. I'm sorry. My face was where your elbow needed to be like in canada can also be a question
[5355.54 --> 5359.06]  I don't know if that's a thing in other places in the world a question like sorry
[5359.06 --> 5363.94]  Yeah, no, that's a thing like hello. Yeah, that's that's totally a thing right?
[5364.98 --> 5366.02]  I don't know
[5366.26 --> 5368.26]  might be
[5368.26 --> 5370.26]  I don't know
[5370.26 --> 5372.42]  I was a I was a what kid what?
[5373.78 --> 5375.14]  um and one of my
[5375.14 --> 5377.46]  That's obnoxious. Yeah, yeah, one of my friends
[5378.18 --> 5379.62]  was a um
[5379.62 --> 5384.42]  a pardon excuse me, I beg your pardon and I started doing it to mock him
[5384.42 --> 5387.06]  And now i'm 100%
[5387.70 --> 5392.66]  On like pardon. Yeah, you do that. I'm very i'm i'm so sorry. I didn't hear you like
[5396.42 --> 5399.06]  The more the funny thing with linus is like the more
[5400.10 --> 5404.74]  How do you say it I beg your pardon the more like appropriately he words it the
[5405.38 --> 5412.82]  Absolute like it's it's a maybe even it's logarithmic. I'm not sure but it's it's more sassy. No, it's it's just habit now
[5412.82 --> 5420.10]  I don't even mean it scales a little bit. It started sassy and it started that sassy. Yeah, but like
[5421.06 --> 5424.26]  Has it toned out? Maybe I just haven't been paying. Luke. I don't even think about it
[5424.66 --> 5427.38]  I'll hear myself say I'll hear myself say it to though
[5428.34 --> 5431.86]  But but i'm not even but i'm not even sassy a lot of those reflex gunner
[5431.86 --> 5435.22]  I just didn't really I just didn't hear you and i'm sorry for that
[5436.50 --> 5438.50]  Begging your pardon, sir
[5438.50 --> 5445.70]  Okay, bad there. I'm being sassy. That's my point though if he if he that is the most sassy thing I've ever had
[5446.58 --> 5448.98]  See please sure I beg your pardon
[5451.78 --> 5453.78]  Get out of here
[5453.78 --> 5455.78]  Oh my goodness and get out of here in video
[5456.02 --> 5460.58]  You're no longer a graphics company. Yeah, apparently. What does that even mean?
[5460.74 --> 5466.90]  I'll tell you training this direction for a long time according to nvidia vice president of corporate marketing greg estes
[5466.90 --> 5468.90]  Speaking to reporter
[5468.90 --> 5475.14]  Steven wit the decision to pivot to ai happened incredibly quickly shortly after the rise of chat gpt
[5475.70 --> 5478.74]  CEO jensen huang sent out an email one friday evening saying
[5479.54 --> 5483.94]  Everything is going to deep learning and we are we're no longer a graphics company
[5484.50 --> 5491.14]  By monday morning. We were an ai company literally it was that fast, which is obviously complete
[5491.14 --> 5493.30]  Bullshit nvidia has been
[5494.10 --> 5496.10]  moving towards
[5496.10 --> 5498.10]  gpu compute
[5498.10 --> 5500.10]  Just everything changed
[5500.10 --> 5502.58]  Everything we woke up and we're like whoa
[5503.78 --> 5506.10]  Yeah, the air even feels different in here
[5506.10 --> 5510.74]  It's remarkable that you got blindsided by this because the rest of us have been talking about it for years
[5512.26 --> 5514.26]  um
[5514.26 --> 5517.46]  Oh, man, it's cool that you guys finally said the quiet part out loud
[5518.10 --> 5518.42]  yeah
[5518.42 --> 5522.98]  uh, that was how wit referred to estes's statement
[5523.46 --> 5527.62]  Around the same time nvidia's leading ai researcher who I assume they hired
[5528.18 --> 5534.02]  Right when they made this decision because why would they have an ai researcher if they were a graphics company before so they just
[5534.34 --> 5536.34]  They pivoted so fast
[5536.34 --> 5536.50]  um
[5537.70 --> 5539.70]  Brian catanzaro said that
[5539.70 --> 5541.94]  uh huang approached him and told him quote
[5542.50 --> 5546.66]  To imagine he'd marched all 8 000 of nvidia's employees into the parking lot
[5546.90 --> 5551.54]  Then he told me I was free to select anyone from the parking lot to join my team. That's so
[5552.82 --> 5557.70]  Wildly overdramatic. Yeah, that's like not actually how that works. Anyway, that's like bollywood
[5563.86 --> 5565.78]  And then it turns into a giant dance number
[5568.02 --> 5571.14]  And then like some jeep comes like flying over
[5572.66 --> 5574.82]  Somebody's riding on the hood like yeah, let's go
[5575.86 --> 5577.86]  I'm the one that's gonna be selected
[5583.78 --> 5585.14]  Sorry, okay
[5588.66 --> 5595.70]  What does this mean for desktop graphics did you and I make the switch to team red just in time to not have a choice anymore?
[5595.70 --> 5597.70]  Yeah, I mean
[5597.70 --> 5599.46]  I
[5599.46 --> 5602.10]  Suspect they'll still make gpus
[5602.82 --> 5603.38]  Why bother?
[5604.42 --> 5608.10]  Yeah, keep the fabs not everybody stays in the consumer space. I mean, okay
[5608.58 --> 5612.82]  Obviously, this is much much smaller scale example, but I think consumers
[5613.54 --> 5618.82]  In general particularly enthusiasts tend to overestimate their own importance
[5618.82 --> 5625.70]  I think they tend to overestimate the size and strength of the enthusiast
[5626.42 --> 5628.74]  Market and obviously gaming has grown a lot
[5629.22 --> 5631.38]  but I think to consumers
[5632.02 --> 5633.54]  dfi for example
[5634.82 --> 5641.46]  Died you know 15 years ago or 10 years ago or whenever whenever they whenever they stopped making sad day
[5641.46 --> 5642.18]  Motherboards
[5642.18 --> 5644.82]  I like dfi except for one small detail
[5645.62 --> 5647.70]  They never stopped making motherboards
[5648.26 --> 5651.70]  Dfi still exists today every once in a while
[5651.70 --> 5655.06]  I will walk past the dfi booth at a trade show and be like
[5655.06 --> 5657.06]  Oh, yeah
[5657.38 --> 5660.90]  Diamond flower international. Sorry, excuse me design for innovation
[5661.94 --> 5664.10]  That was a that was a retcon back in the day
[5668.82 --> 5672.26]  Yeah, oh ibm yeah ibm is a great example
[5672.26 --> 5677.94]  They even pulled out their like sub brand that yeah that got rid of lenovo. Yep. See you later. And so
[5679.06 --> 5681.06]  Why not?
[5681.06 --> 5683.06]  Why doesn't nvidia just go?
[5683.06 --> 5687.94]  Yep, a is the future. Why don't we just buy every possible wafer?
[5688.98 --> 5690.98]  And turn it into ai accelerators because
[5692.26 --> 5697.30]  It's probably worth more than gold and just be the entire ai future of the entire planet
[5697.94 --> 5698.90]  and
[5698.90 --> 5702.90]  Let amd and intel fight over like these like tiny scrap
[5704.50 --> 5705.62]  gamers. Yeah, yeah
[5706.66 --> 5707.70]  like
[5707.70 --> 5712.82]  Bow to their you know complaining about your prices. They complain about your your product
[5712.82 --> 5713.70]  They complain about
[5715.14 --> 5720.18]  Everything you know and and to be clear. I'm not saying the complaints aren't valid. I'm just saying that
[5721.46 --> 5722.58]  It's a lot less
[5723.38 --> 5724.82]  challenging
[5724.82 --> 5726.98]  From a day-to-day standpoint
[5726.98 --> 5729.86]  Not from an engineering standpoint, but from a day-to-day standpoint
[5730.50 --> 5732.74]  Having just a handful of customers
[5732.74 --> 5736.58]  That you can engage with meaningfully one-on-one who have big money
[5737.06 --> 5739.86]  Compared to having a whole bunch of customers that are gonna
[5740.98 --> 5745.30]  That are gonna hate you no matter what you do no matter how good of a deal you give them
[5746.18 --> 5748.34]  I don't think that that last part is necessarily true
[5748.34 --> 5750.90]  But I could see how nvidia might kind of perceive it that way these days
[5750.90 --> 5755.38]  You know from their point of you more's law is dead and you should accept it and we're giving you the best we can
[5755.78 --> 5756.90]  Deal with it
[5756.90 --> 5758.34]  um, you know, i'm sorry you're mad
[5758.82 --> 5760.82]  Essentially, right? Yeah, um
[5762.10 --> 5766.18]  But it's not like we didn't like them when we felt like we were you know getting a lot from them
[5766.18 --> 5768.58]  But you know really it's not that we're not still getting stuff
[5768.58 --> 5772.58]  It's just that we're not getting what we're accustomed to and that's really that's really challenging
[5772.98 --> 5775.38]  um, that makes us feel you know, not not
[5775.94 --> 5778.74]  Taken seriously, and I guess yeah, I don't think I don't think
[5779.38 --> 5785.62]  Nvidia does take the gaming market nearly as seriously as it used to and I think you can see that evidenced in the way that nvidia talks about it
[5786.82 --> 5788.82]  um
[5788.82 --> 5790.42]  Yeah, sucks
[5790.42 --> 5792.42]  It's not like I don't like the products right
[5796.18 --> 5801.94]  I mean z biggie says what's the percentage of their business that's graphics microsoft has about eight percent of their revenue from xbox
[5801.94 --> 5804.74]  So if they keep a division that's eight percent why wouldn't nvidia keep graphics?
[5805.22 --> 5806.34]  I'm
[5806.34 --> 5814.02]  Look, it's possible. Yeah, they'll keep graphics forever and they'll and they'll you know eventually turn into kind of uh, you know
[5814.02 --> 5820.18]  A scrappy subdivision or whatever the case may be. I don't think you can do that comparison either though, but we're talking fab capacity
[5820.58 --> 5825.62]  Well, not just not it's not just fab capacity. It's also just the um
[5830.34 --> 5834.34]  I don't know it's almost just like the will it's like the it's like the the
[5834.34 --> 5836.34]  the interest you know, I
[5836.34 --> 5841.70]  I I haven't I I haven't spent a ton of time talking to jensen. I've only met him. I think a couple times
[5841.70 --> 5843.54]  um, but from you know
[5844.10 --> 5848.10]  interviews from watching him talk um from those handful of interactions, you know
[5848.10 --> 5853.06]  He's a super passionate guy. I'm sure every story i've heard about him super super passionate
[5853.06 --> 5856.02]  um, i've heard him i've heard him described as
[5856.02 --> 5858.90]  as the kind of boss where
[5860.42 --> 5863.38]  He can be hyper assertive and
[5863.38 --> 5868.42]  And swoop in and act like he can do your job better than you can
[5868.42 --> 5874.42]  And what makes you most infuriated is the fact that he can can
[5875.46 --> 5877.46]  and it's like
[5877.46 --> 5881.22]  Okay, well, what do I do now because i've been you know like like i've heard him described that way
[5881.22 --> 5884.90]  I've also heard him described in other less favorable ways, but the point is
[5885.38 --> 5890.42]  Everything aligns with this perception that he's extremely passionate and he's clearly passionate about
[5890.98 --> 5892.26]  ai now
[5892.26 --> 5895.06]  um, and their leadership very much
[5895.70 --> 5901.70]  Flows from the top down. Yeah, and so you know what yeah, maybe maybe gaming, you know
[5901.70 --> 5903.70]  Does continue to get some attention over there?
[5904.58 --> 5906.26]  But maybe it doesn't because remember too
[5906.26 --> 5913.86]  It's not just about what percentage of your overall business it is sometimes it's about what looks better to your shareholders and gaming margins are
[5915.06 --> 5915.62]  pretty
[5915.62 --> 5919.14]  crappy compared to workstation margins compared to enterprise margins
[5919.94 --> 5920.90]  um
[5920.90 --> 5924.02]  And you know what yeah, they they might they might like the volume
[5924.50 --> 5931.62]  um, you know that that might ultimately result in in bigger volume discounts for their real products that they make margin on when they're booking with a
[5931.62 --> 5935.30]  You know a tsmc or who knows someday maybe intel's you know fab
[5935.30 --> 5938.18]  uh fab business or something like that but
[5939.46 --> 5942.34]  I don't I just all i'm saying is I don't think it's a guarantee
[5945.14 --> 5947.14]  Yeah
[5947.86 --> 5955.06]  CEOs are infinitely replaceable. I don't get the focus on them says siginth that's super not true. That's actually like super not true
[5955.78 --> 5961.22]  Think about it this way. I think we can all agree that a bad ceo can destroy a company
[5961.22 --> 5964.26]  QED
[5964.26 --> 5967.06]  That was it. Yep, that's it that
[5968.10 --> 5968.82]  whole argument
[5969.78 --> 5970.90]  obliterated
[5970.90 --> 5972.90]  um

[6196.42 --> 6202.42]  Oh, this is hilarious. I didn't know dbrand was a sponsor for the show today. They sponsored wanshow after dark. Yeah
[6202.50 --> 6208.74]  So when I was all like dbrand our sponsor, I just thought meant in general. I didn't mean specifically right now
[6210.90 --> 6212.02]  It's great it works
[6212.58 --> 6216.82]  All right. Oh, we're supposed to do three merge messages. Uh, do you want to do the first one luke? Because I have to go peek sure
[6217.38 --> 6220.42]  Uh, if there's one for me, I will have a look
[6220.42 --> 6223.06]  Nobody asked them about you
[6225.62 --> 6232.10]  No, there's a couple good ones in here. Sure. Luke any thoughts on world of warcraft classic season of discovery?
[6232.26 --> 6236.10]  I hadn't played classic before but it's been a blast finding and sharing new things with everyone
[6236.58 --> 6240.98]  Yeah, my uh, my brother and a buddy of mine played last night actually
[6241.30 --> 6246.10]  Um, it's the only time I had this entire week. So it was convenient because it came out yesterday
[6246.10 --> 6248.58]  Um, it's pretty cool
[6249.14 --> 6255.94]  I I am intentionally the whole idea is the discovery word, right? So i've intentionally been going in pretty blind. Um
[6257.06 --> 6260.50]  Not trying to look things up just trying to play it and see what's going on
[6261.22 --> 6266.90]  Um, and it seems neat so far. I don't have a lot else to say. I haven't played a ton
[6266.90 --> 6268.66]  We'll see how it goes
[6268.66 --> 6272.02]  So the whole idea if you haven't heard of it is they have like a
[6272.58 --> 6278.42]  Progressing level cap. So it's classic with some changes through this rune system that you can look up if you care
[6278.90 --> 6281.38]  Um, and then the initial level cap is all 25
[6281.94 --> 6287.38]  And there's like they turn some dungeon into a raid or something and we can go do that and there's other new gear and things are cool
[6287.38 --> 6290.98]  But it's like it's like a a different experience
[6291.94 --> 6295.38]  But in the wow classic environment
[6296.26 --> 6298.26]  Which is a cool concept
[6298.34 --> 6300.42]  I feel like they took a lot of lead from
[6301.14 --> 6304.26]  Um, like runescape who's done very similar things
[6304.74 --> 6308.58]  Uh, just like they took a lot of lead from runescape when they made wild classic at all
[6309.54 --> 6313.30]  So they're just just taking more reliefs from that book, but yeah, it was good
[6314.82 --> 6320.10]  Luke as a software developer, why do you not share the programmers pessimism perspective
[6320.10 --> 6327.46]  to large language model a eyes the last 10 is always the hardest and longest part for example self-driving cars
[6328.02 --> 6330.02]  Yeah, when did I not say that?
[6331.62 --> 6333.62]  I have no idea
[6333.62 --> 6335.70]  This anonymous person thinks that
[6336.50 --> 6339.30]  You think like that. Yeah, do you think like that? No
[6341.14 --> 6345.70]  Um, I think I think I'm probably less pessimistic about where it's at now
[6345.70 --> 6348.66]  That might be where the confusion's at
[6349.22 --> 6356.50]  Um, i've said a number of times on wanshow that I think it's like really far away from being 100% like many years probably
[6356.82 --> 6361.62]  Um, the hallucination problem is going to stick around for like a hot minute
[6362.02 --> 6362.90]  Do you think it'll get worse?
[6363.70 --> 6365.78]  Because you're seeing self-feeding data now
[6365.78 --> 6367.94]  Yeah, there's there's a lot of potential for that
[6368.18 --> 6371.86]  Uh, we'll have to see if they can find some tricks to try to stop that from happening
[6371.86 --> 6372.42]  Um
[6374.42 --> 6377.78]  It it felt like it kind of did at one point already. It's hard to measure
[6378.50 --> 6379.62]  It's very hard to measure
[6381.14 --> 6387.78]  Um, but yeah, no yeah finishing this thing is gonna be a problem. I said like in one of the first streams that we ever covered ai stuff
[6387.94 --> 6389.38]  that's of course where we ended up
[6389.78 --> 6390.02]  um
[6390.66 --> 6395.22]  That like shipping products around this was going to be incredibly difficult and take a very long time
[6395.54 --> 6397.46]  Um, and that has proven to be the case
[6397.46 --> 6402.42]  Okay, and let's see we got one more here for linus
[6403.38 --> 6403.70]  Nice
[6404.50 --> 6408.98]  I'm just in time. You're just in time. It would have been awkward if you'd read one for linus while I wasn't here
[6410.18 --> 6417.94]  With my kids deciding to plant my screwdriver bits. Thanks for the restock and needing to plant them like in the garden
[6419.22 --> 6420.42]  I mean that's one way to get more
[6420.42 --> 6421.14]  Yeah
[6423.22 --> 6430.18]  That's one weird trick, uh, and needing shipment to australia. What's the most expensive thing your kids have broken or lost?
[6432.90 --> 6435.62]  Wow, my kids are actually super careful. Um
[6439.38 --> 6441.38]  Uh
[6441.54 --> 6445.22]  Like I like my son got his first phone at I think eight
[6445.22 --> 6450.98]  Um, wow seven or eight still has it perfect condition
[6451.62 --> 6453.62]  um
[6455.46 --> 6461.46]  Trying to think what did they what did they have that they all oh they almost broke something very expensive
[6461.94 --> 6464.02]  The uh the sony oled tv
[6465.14 --> 6467.14]  In the family room, uh
[6467.14 --> 6475.54]  My girls while it was just sitting in the like the base of the tv packaging while it was just sitting there they knocked the whole thing over
[6476.58 --> 6476.98]  um
[6477.86 --> 6479.46]  It lived?
[6479.46 --> 6482.26]  Not a scratch. Whoa. I I gave them
[6483.62 --> 6488.74]  It was a miracle that it wasn't broken because that was thousands of dollars. Yeah, um, so
[6489.38 --> 6493.22]  That's the I think the closest that they've gotten to breaking something
[6493.86 --> 6498.98]  Very significant. I mean they do damage to the house and stuff, but I so a lot of that's just gonna happen
[6498.98 --> 6501.78]  That's just that's that's pretty much wear and tear. Yeah
[6502.66 --> 6502.74]  Uh
[6503.54 --> 6505.38]  Yeah, i'd say that's the worst they ever did
[6506.18 --> 6511.22]  I I thought you were gonna take the approach of like you've kind of colloquially called some of your
[6512.10 --> 6512.58]  employees
[6513.22 --> 6514.42]  kids before
[6514.42 --> 6516.42]  Oh, they've broken stuff
[6516.42 --> 6520.26]  Yeah, don't imagine for a second that i'm the only one who's ever broken anything around here
[6520.26 --> 6524.18]  I'm, just the only one who is on camera when it happens and catches the blame. Yeah
[6524.98 --> 6525.22]  Yeah
[6526.98 --> 6529.06]  I I 100 thought it was going to your floor
[6532.82 --> 6535.94]  Anyways, I think that was the third we move on that was the third topics. Yeah
[6537.06 --> 6537.30]  Okay
[6542.18 --> 6547.54]  What what what is this legally distinct tech vtubers?
[6547.54 --> 6554.18]  I don't know what that is from zola. I don't really want to click on that stuff. Hey linus click this
[6554.90 --> 6556.50]  Well, i'm gonna do it. Oh my goodness
[6561.30 --> 6561.62]  Uh
[6562.82 --> 6564.82]  Is that you and me?
[6564.98 --> 6568.42]  Yep, let's go. I got lena seveston fly boat

[6574.02 --> 6580.26]  That's a really good name actually, that's actually sick. Oh, okay
[6581.06 --> 6584.66]  It's like a stage name. That's dope. That's a great great name
[6588.58 --> 6589.86]  Wow, uh cool
[6590.66 --> 6594.90]  I that's not what I was expecting to look at today. You're actively dropping a gpu
[6595.70 --> 6599.86]  I think i'm throwing it. Yeah. Yeah, I know i'm down with that. Yeah, um
[6599.86 --> 6605.46]  I think it's great

[6671.54 --> 6675.14]  That's that's me. That's literally me. You can't say that come on
[6675.14 --> 6677.14]  Oh

[6689.38 --> 6693.62]  Flow plane. Why leave lena alone. She's lawless. Oh, my
[6695.94 --> 6698.42]  Okay, okay. All right, let's um
[6699.86 --> 6700.90]  Let's move on
[6701.94 --> 6704.58]  Microsoft paint plus now with dolly
[6706.10 --> 6708.10]  Oh, no way we get to try it
[6708.26 --> 6708.98]  Yay
[6708.98 --> 6714.82]  The windows 11 paint app now has an integrated co-creator text to image generator feature
[6715.06 --> 6719.86]  Yes, this laptop is this all users or is this just like early access people or
[6720.90 --> 6722.90]  Pre-release okay, okay

[6730.34 --> 6731.30]  It's the best game
[6731.30 --> 6734.58]  Okay, if people from people from our era
[6735.30 --> 6737.94]  That's actually a thing when when you didn't have the internet
[6739.38 --> 6740.18]  Give me your laptop
[6740.18 --> 6741.30]  No, I want it
[6741.30 --> 6743.14]  Come on lena. Why are you taking it?
[6743.14 --> 6745.86]  Come on lena. I want the talk in the chat. Can I just have it here?
[6747.14 --> 6748.18]  Let them have it
[6748.18 --> 6749.46]  Can I just have it?
[6749.46 --> 6750.50]  It's playing audio
[6750.50 --> 6752.98]  Yeah, because you unplug the HDMI so the audio device reset
[6752.98 --> 6753.94]  Dan told me to unplug the HDMI
[6753.94 --> 6757.62]  Yeah, but there's other steps included in that process
[6758.90 --> 6760.90]  Figured out lena
[6762.66 --> 6763.62]  Trying to make things smooth
[6763.62 --> 6764.42]  Sorry, make it smooth
[6764.42 --> 6765.94]  Sorry, Luca or whatever your name is
[6765.94 --> 6767.14]  Lucy get it right
[6767.14 --> 6771.22]  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I mean I only got one letter wrong. It's 75% right
[6781.30 --> 6783.70]  You should totally license the design for some t-shirts
[6785.22 --> 6788.98]  That'd be a pretty specific reference, but I bet you people would buy it
[6789.94 --> 6790.26]  Stop
[6792.50 --> 6793.38]  I know I would
[6794.34 --> 6795.62]  Stop it, Ian! No!
[6795.62 --> 6797.62]  No! No!
[6797.62 --> 6798.02]  No!
[6798.02 --> 6798.42]  No!
[6798.42 --> 6798.82]  No!
[6798.82 --> 6799.22]  No!
[6799.22 --> 6800.02]  No!
[6800.02 --> 6800.42]  No!
[6800.42 --> 6800.82]  No!
[6803.22 --> 6803.70]  Stop
[6805.86 --> 6807.22]  Is the computer not even booting?
[6808.26 --> 6811.06]  I mean Dan prepared it so it was a 50-50 shot from the outset
[6812.58 --> 6813.70]  Everything's 50-50
[6814.34 --> 6815.94]  In this case it either worked or it didn't
[6818.26 --> 6819.94]  Oh, you know what? I think it's probably
[6820.58 --> 6822.34]  Outputting to the external display because it's on
[6822.34 --> 6822.74]  It's not
[6822.74 --> 6823.22]  It's like
[6823.22 --> 6824.74]  No body pillow
[6824.74 --> 6825.62]  It's not even on
[6825.62 --> 6826.26]  Okay, stop
[6826.26 --> 6827.38]  We have a body pillow coming
[6832.74 --> 6834.26]  Is it like a GPU?
[6834.26 --> 6835.54]  All I'll say is that it's coming
[6840.74 --> 6840.98]  No
[6840.98 --> 6845.38]  I hate it here
[6851.70 --> 6857.14]  It just uses the confetti design from the um the women's underwear and the onesie
[6857.14 --> 6857.94]  Yeah, that makes sense
[6857.94 --> 6862.10]  Yeah, we decided we decided not to go anime girl with it
[6862.10 --> 6866.10]  Um, we thought we'd keep it um, you know
[6868.98 --> 6870.42]  Put the cl in it, you know
[6870.42 --> 6872.42]  You know
[6872.42 --> 6873.54]  You know with the cl
[6873.54 --> 6874.74]  Classy
[6875.86 --> 6876.98]  Not without the cl
[6876.98 --> 6877.46]  You know
[6879.94 --> 6880.10]  Just
[6880.10 --> 6880.98]  Classy with an eye
[6887.62 --> 6888.66]  What's going on here Dan?
[6888.66 --> 6889.62]  I don't know
[6889.62 --> 6890.66]  The laptop won't turn on
[6890.66 --> 6894.34]  Maybe take the laptop away from him and get it turned on and then bring it back
[6894.34 --> 6895.62]  My magic fingers
[6895.62 --> 6896.34]  We can do another topic
[6896.34 --> 6896.82]  I touch tech
[6896.82 --> 6897.30]  It break
[6897.30 --> 6898.74]  Luke said this would happen
[6899.86 --> 6900.18]  Did I?
[6900.18 --> 6901.30]  Did you say this would happen?
[6901.30 --> 6902.26]  Did I?
[6902.26 --> 6903.78]  Oh yeah, no I totally did
[6903.78 --> 6905.22]  Yeah, let's go
[6905.22 --> 6906.18]  I remember that
[6906.18 --> 6908.50]  I didn't do anything
[6910.18 --> 6910.90]  I can't explain this
[6910.90 --> 6912.18]  It doesn't even have Linux on it
[6912.18 --> 6913.78]  That I know
[6914.42 --> 6915.86]  No, this is this is my whole point
[6915.86 --> 6918.58]  I was talking about how we we were gonna work on something
[6918.58 --> 6920.98]  But I was like we're gonna we have to be really really thorough about it
[6921.30 --> 6925.70]  We should test it really thoroughly and then before we release it we need to hand it to Linus
[6925.86 --> 6928.66]  Because everything breaks when he touches it
[6928.66 --> 6931.38]  So that'll be our like final line of of testing
[6931.38 --> 6933.70]  Sometimes things magically work when I touch them though
[6933.70 --> 6934.26]  Yeah
[6934.26 --> 6935.14]  You've witnessed that
[6935.14 --> 6936.98]  But if something is currently working
[6936.98 --> 6938.90]  So my power is that I change the
[6938.90 --> 6940.42]  Just functional status of things
[6940.42 --> 6940.82]  Yeah
[6940.82 --> 6941.38]  Yeah
[6941.38 --> 6941.94]  Yeah
[6941.94 --> 6942.90]  I'm angry
[6944.18 --> 6944.66]  It's okay
[6944.66 --> 6951.38]  That's really funny
[6951.38 --> 6952.82]  That's fine we'll do that later
[6952.82 --> 6953.38]  Yeah
[6953.38 --> 6955.14]  Yeah whenever it's working who cares
[6956.02 --> 6957.86]  We can talk about how our social media team is hiring
[6958.74 --> 6959.06]  Sure
[6959.06 --> 6962.90]  We're hiring both a short form video coordinator and an organic content and memes coordinator
[6962.90 --> 6964.02]  Is that really a job title here?
[6964.58 --> 6966.26]  I'll call it out right now as well
[6966.26 --> 6967.94]  It's gonna be posted up very soon
[6967.94 --> 6969.14]  I wanted it posted up this week
[6969.14 --> 6970.10]  But there was there was
[6970.90 --> 6972.50]  It's there for reasons it's not
[6972.50 --> 6974.18]  But it'll be up sometime next week
[6974.74 --> 6976.10]  But we're posting a position
[6976.74 --> 6979.70]  That probably a surprising amount of you are going to be interested in
[6979.70 --> 6983.06]  And I'm kind of terrified about the incoming applications
[6983.06 --> 6984.74]  But it is local only
[6984.74 --> 6986.34]  So that should help a lot
[6986.34 --> 6987.78]  It must be local only
[6987.78 --> 6992.82]  And you must literally right now be legally able to work in Canada
[6994.34 --> 6997.94]  So like you pretty much have to be here already to be clear
[6997.94 --> 7004.82]  But we are hiring a junior level one IT tech support position
[7006.26 --> 7008.02]  We need some help on that team
[7008.82 --> 7009.54]  So full time
[7009.54 --> 7010.42]  You're gonna get some applicants
[7010.42 --> 7010.82]  Yeah
[7010.82 --> 7014.26]  Full time
[7014.26 --> 7017.54]  But you don't need a ton of experience
[7017.54 --> 7019.14]  We are looking for someone
[7019.14 --> 7021.22]  That would obviously be able to like
[7021.78 --> 7023.94]  Construct and deconstruct computers
[7023.94 --> 7026.18]  Do some basic troubleshooting
[7026.18 --> 7030.26]  Have some basic understanding of networks and networking
[7030.26 --> 7031.38]  Stuff like that
[7031.38 --> 7033.78]  Lots of opportunity to learn on the job
[7033.78 --> 7036.26]  Working under like AJ and Sean and myself
[7036.26 --> 7037.46]  And with Dan
[7037.46 --> 7040.90]  And yeah
[7040.90 --> 7042.58]  It should be really cool
[7044.02 --> 7045.30]  Maybe an interesting opportunity
[7046.66 --> 7047.46]  But it is
[7047.46 --> 7048.98]  Yeah it is a very junior position
[7048.98 --> 7049.78]  Um
[7052.34 --> 7052.58]  Yeah
[7053.46 --> 7054.34]  Sounds mint
[7056.50 --> 7057.14]  Junior mint
[7057.14 --> 7057.86]  All right
[7057.86 --> 7059.22]  I was like is he being a zoomer
[7059.22 --> 7059.86]  That's a stretch
[7059.86 --> 7061.46]  Nope he's being a boomer
[7061.46 --> 7062.02]  Yeah
[7062.02 --> 7063.22]  You're not sure which one
[7063.22 --> 7064.50]  Mint's not a zoomer thing
[7065.06 --> 7066.18]  Junior mints
[7066.18 --> 7067.78]  No I just mean like mint
[7067.78 --> 7068.34]  That's mint
[7068.34 --> 7069.14]  That's that's
[7069.14 --> 7070.02]  Nah that's ancient
[7070.02 --> 7070.90]  Oh I don't know
[7070.90 --> 7071.38]  Oh okay
[7071.38 --> 7071.94]  I'm not gonna
[7071.94 --> 7072.50]  Yeah
[7073.38 --> 7074.34]  I have no idea
[7074.34 --> 7075.62]  Wait what do you mean nice zoomer talk
[7075.62 --> 7076.58]  No Elijah said the same thing
[7076.58 --> 7077.38]  Did I just fool him?
[7078.98 --> 7080.50]  Is he trying to act?
[7080.50 --> 7081.54]  Like how old is he?
[7081.54 --> 7083.22]  Is he not zoomery anymore?
[7083.22 --> 7083.94]  Is he not young?
[7084.58 --> 7084.90]  I don't know
[7084.90 --> 7085.86]  Are zoomers old now?
[7086.42 --> 7086.82]  I don't know
[7087.30 --> 7088.26]  What's the one under them?
[7088.26 --> 7089.30]  I mean they're less old than us
[7089.30 --> 7090.02]  What's the next one?
[7090.02 --> 7090.98]  Under them is gen alpha
[7091.54 --> 7092.26]  Oh wow
[7092.90 --> 7093.46]  I know right?
[7094.02 --> 7094.58]  Wow
[7094.58 --> 7095.70]  I mean who gets to name these things?
[7095.70 --> 7097.46]  Imagine being called gen alpha
[7097.46 --> 7098.66]  Yeah then what's the next one gonna be?
[7098.66 --> 7099.06]  Sigma?
[7100.02 --> 7100.34]  Wow
[7100.90 --> 7101.14]  Yeah
[7101.70 --> 7102.58]  Gen Chad
[7103.14 --> 7103.62]  Like you're just
[7105.06 --> 7105.46]  Wow
[7106.98 --> 7107.70]  Okay
[7107.70 --> 7108.50]  You good Dan?
[7108.98 --> 7110.50]  The battery was charged
[7110.50 --> 7111.78]  And then we did Wanshow
[7111.78 --> 7113.06]  And it only lasts for like
[7113.06 --> 7114.66]  He says the battery was charged
[7114.66 --> 7114.98]  Which
[7114.98 --> 7115.54]  Oh yeah
[7115.78 --> 7117.46]  So Dan did something really cool too
[7117.46 --> 7119.94]  With the like back grid display thing
[7119.94 --> 7121.06]  That sounds like a good use of time
[7121.06 --> 7121.70]  Here you go
[7121.70 --> 7122.18]  Um
[7122.18 --> 7124.18]  Honestly he was probably bored waiting for you
[7124.18 --> 7124.50]  Yeah
[7124.50 --> 7125.86]  I was actually waiting for Luke
[7125.86 --> 7126.58]  Oh Dan
[7126.58 --> 7127.70]  God I'm waiting for Luke
[7127.70 --> 7128.18]  Love it
[7128.18 --> 7128.42]  Psyched
[7128.42 --> 7129.70]  You guys couldn't hear his comeback
[7129.70 --> 7131.06]  I was stuck in a meeting
[7131.06 --> 7133.54]  Luke got roasted
[7133.54 --> 7134.42]  I did
[7134.42 --> 7136.26]  Like over an open fire
[7136.26 --> 7136.82]  Yeah
[7136.82 --> 7138.34]  He was a chestnut
[7138.34 --> 7139.22]  If I was
[7139.22 --> 7139.78]  It's Christmas
[7139.78 --> 7140.50]  What do you want?
[7140.66 --> 7141.14]  If I was
[7141.14 --> 7143.94]  It's December now
[7143.94 --> 7145.00]  If I was gen alpha
[7145.00 --> 7147.10]  It probably wouldn't even have affected me at all
[7147.10 --> 7147.86]  It's fair game
[7147.86 --> 7148.26]  Yeah
[7148.26 --> 7159.60]  Oh yeah
[7159.60 --> 7160.54]  I never checked if
[7160.54 --> 7160.94]  Um
[7160.94 --> 7162.34]  Elijah responded
[7162.34 --> 7164.12]  To what?
[7164.68 --> 7165.06]  Man
[7165.06 --> 7167.58]  The next AMD ultimate tech upgrade is great
[7167.58 --> 7168.94]  Oh he said I'm 17
[7168.94 --> 7169.92]  So he's like clearly
[7169.92 --> 7171.48]  They um
[7171.48 --> 7172.46]  It's not true
[7172.46 --> 7173.32]  I don't believe you
[7173.32 --> 7175.12]  They Elijah saved the workspace
[7175.12 --> 7176.58]  What?
[7177.66 --> 7180.28]  So we've got work safe signs on the stairs
[7180.28 --> 7182.40]  About maintaining three points of contact
[7182.40 --> 7183.68]  Cover the stairs with pillows
[7183.68 --> 7186.10]  We also provided Elijah with a helmet
[7186.10 --> 7189.76]  We thought it was easier to put the padding on him
[7189.76 --> 7192.42]  Than to try to put the padding on everything he might touch
[7192.42 --> 7192.98]  Fair enough
[7192.98 --> 7193.42]  Yeah
[7193.42 --> 7197.66]  Just like tape him up like pillows
[7197.66 --> 7202.06]  You guys
[7202.06 --> 7202.64]  Oh yeah
[7202.64 --> 7203.88]  You gotta look at the back of the laptop
[7203.88 --> 7204.38]  Oh
[7204.38 --> 7204.76]  Sorry
[7204.76 --> 7207.04]  Oh that's um
[7207.04 --> 7208.60]  That was good use of time
[7208.60 --> 7211.96]  Oh I thought it said short Linus
[7211.96 --> 7212.26]  Okay
[7212.26 --> 7212.76]  Oh no
[7212.76 --> 7213.28]  Wait what?
[7213.56 --> 7214.18]  I don't know
[7214.18 --> 7215.68]  I thought maybe DRAM put him up to it
[7215.68 --> 7216.78]  Cause they sponsored the
[7216.78 --> 7218.00]  They sponsored the
[7218.00 --> 7219.14]  Afterdark today
[7219.14 --> 7220.30]  Uh
[7220.30 --> 7220.54]  The
[7220.54 --> 7221.06]  Okay
[7221.06 --> 7222.10]  The Wanshore
[7222.10 --> 7223.30]  Does it just say
[7223.30 --> 7223.82]  Linus
[7223.82 --> 7224.32]  Tech
[7224.32 --> 7224.92]  Okay
[7224.92 --> 7225.42]  Oh that
[7225.42 --> 7225.82]  Wow
[7225.82 --> 7227.50]  Does this take a long time
[7227.50 --> 7228.26]  Or is it just like
[7228.26 --> 7229.20]  You just like do text entry
[7229.20 --> 7231.38]  I think you just took a long time to comprehend it
[7231.38 --> 7237.54]  Cause it's pretty straightforward
[7237.54 --> 7241.78]  I'm just asking if it takes a long time to program it okay
[7241.78 --> 7243.46]  Oh I don't know
[7243.46 --> 7244.60]  Oh yeah it's done in After Effects
[7244.60 --> 7245.88]  It took about 25 hours
[7245.88 --> 7246.96]  Shut up
[7246.96 --> 7247.92]  Stop
[7247.92 --> 7249.44]  It's just part of the ROG tool
[7249.44 --> 7250.32]  Yeah I just mean like
[7250.32 --> 7251.96]  You just type Linus
[7251.96 --> 7252.54]  Tech Tips
[7252.54 --> 7253.96]  Like can you do different fonts and stuff
[7253.96 --> 7254.96]  Yeah there's font selection
[7254.96 --> 7257.18]  You can do little animations and pictures and things like that
[7257.18 --> 7257.54]  It's neat
[7257.54 --> 7258.54]  Yeah I've never played around before
[7258.54 --> 7260.36]  Is it already set up for the three different lines?
[7260.68 --> 7261.62]  You can have up to eight
[7261.62 --> 7262.34]  Okay
[7262.34 --> 7262.66]  Really?
[7262.92 --> 7263.06]  Yeah
[7263.06 --> 7265.64]  So but the lines on angle is like a default thing
[7265.64 --> 7267.24]  Yeah you have to do it exactly like this
[7267.24 --> 7268.42]  And it kind of is frustrating
[7268.42 --> 7270.20]  But whatever
[7270.20 --> 7271.16]  Okay
[7271.16 --> 7272.60]  Okay that seems to be working
[7272.60 --> 7275.18]  Let's get rid of your person there
[7275.18 --> 7276.06]  Co-creator
[7276.06 --> 7277.54]  Okay so here we go
[7277.54 --> 7279.82]  I have no idea how this works
[7279.82 --> 7281.62]  So I'm gonna make Luke
[7281.62 --> 7283.88]  You only have 50 tokens right now
[7283.88 --> 7284.14]  Oh
[7284.14 --> 7284.88]  You can see down the bottom
[7284.88 --> 7286.24]  So don't go like too crazy
[7286.24 --> 7288.90]  Okay so I'm gonna make Luke super mad
[7288.90 --> 7294.14]  Because I'm probably gonna you know do something that
[7294.14 --> 7296.12]  You know it doesn't do or whatever
[7296.12 --> 7297.10]  And they didn't intend
[7297.10 --> 7298.00]  And then he'll be mad
[7298.00 --> 7300.38]  No I don't care
[7300.38 --> 7302.28]  Just do it
[7302.28 --> 7304.82]  I'm drawing with a trackpad okay
[7304.82 --> 7305.88]  So go easy on me here
[7305.88 --> 7308.30]  Okay I'm gonna need
[7308.30 --> 7310.12]  When are you gonna use the co-creator?
[7310.20 --> 7311.30]  Do I make a manscaped joke?
[7311.32 --> 7313.18]  I'm gonna use the co-creator okay
[7313.18 --> 7314.18]  Oh okay
[7314.18 --> 7316.10]  So you're gonna draw a bass scene
[7316.10 --> 7317.92]  And you're gonna ask it to like improve it or something?
[7317.96 --> 7319.08]  Yeah I want like
[7319.08 --> 7320.24]  That's cool
[7320.24 --> 7321.42]  That seems like a good use
[7321.42 --> 7322.64]  I want
[7322.64 --> 7326.24]  You should ask it to add something to it
[7326.24 --> 7327.62]  While matching your art style
[7327.62 --> 7331.10]  Interesting okay
[7331.10 --> 7332.86]  That's not something I thought of
[7332.86 --> 7333.56]  But I do
[7333.56 --> 7334.36]  I do like
[7334.36 --> 7336.74]  I just I seriously don't think it'll be able to do it
[7336.74 --> 7337.04]  But I just wonder
[7337.04 --> 7337.72]  Okay what just happened
[7337.72 --> 7338.20]  Didn't I
[7338.20 --> 7340.02]  Did I not just say solid fill?
[7340.50 --> 7343.24]  What was the point of me saying that?
[7343.46 --> 7345.22]  I am not sure if I understand
[7345.22 --> 7346.88]  I must have done something wrong here
[7346.88 --> 7347.70]  But there boom
[7347.70 --> 7348.10]  Got him
[7348.10 --> 7349.68]  And then let
[7349.68 --> 7350.04]  You know what
[7350.04 --> 7350.78]  Let's do some
[7350.78 --> 7352.34]  Let's do some little flowery flowers
[7352.34 --> 7353.04]  Nice
[7353.04 --> 7353.36]  Oops
[7353.36 --> 7357.44]  Things were attempted
[7357.44 --> 7361.00]  Let's put some happy little trees over there
[7361.10 --> 7361.90]  Happy little flowers
[7361.90 --> 7363.20]  Okay here we go
[7363.20 --> 7364.16]  Little happy flowers
[7364.16 --> 7364.58]  Boop
[7364.58 --> 7365.18]  Wow
[7365.18 --> 7366.42]  Boop boop boop
[7366.42 --> 7367.48]  Boop boop boop
[7367.48 --> 7367.98]  Such
[7367.98 --> 7368.56]  Such
[7368.56 --> 7369.84]  Legally distinct
[7369.84 --> 7370.52]  Petals
[7370.52 --> 7372.18]  Leaves
[7372.18 --> 7377.06]  Okay
[7377.06 --> 7378.74]  I would like to add
[7378.74 --> 7381.64]  Is that a black line
[7381.64 --> 7382.84]  With like a red outline?
[7383.06 --> 7383.80]  Is that what you just did?
[7384.50 --> 7385.22]  Getting fancy
[7385.22 --> 7387.54]  Can you add a person?
[7388.02 --> 7388.44]  I don't know
[7388.44 --> 7388.84]  Why do I
[7388.84 --> 7389.60]  Why am I so polite?
[7390.02 --> 7391.24]  Add a person to my scene
[7391.24 --> 7392.08]  In the same art style
[7392.08 --> 7392.98]  You can be polite
[7392.98 --> 7393.68]  It's fine
[7393.68 --> 7395.28]  Create
[7395.28 --> 7395.60]  Create
[7395.60 --> 7399.74]  I just
[7399.74 --> 7400.78]  I have a feeling it's going to struggle
[7400.78 --> 7401.48]  With the art style
[7401.48 --> 7401.86]  Yeah there's no
[7401.86 --> 7402.50]  There's no way
[7402.50 --> 7402.88]  Yeah
[7402.88 --> 7405.84]  I just want to see it like try
[7405.84 --> 7409.20]  It's thinking for a minute
[7409.20 --> 7409.90]  Wow
[7409.90 --> 7411.38]  Interesting
[7411.38 --> 7412.68]  It did try
[7412.68 --> 7414.88]  Okay let's try something else
[7414.88 --> 7416.74]  Oh so it doesn't actually do it
[7416.74 --> 7417.88]  Do you have to like drag and drop
[7417.88 --> 7418.80]  The selections over?
[7418.94 --> 7419.68]  Is that what's going on?
[7422.54 --> 7423.20]  No that's
[7423.20 --> 7424.64]  These are styles you can select
[7424.64 --> 7425.46]  No no no
[7425.46 --> 7426.50]  The things under it
[7426.50 --> 7427.56]  These?
[7427.74 --> 7427.98]  Yeah
[7427.98 --> 7429.72]  I don't know
[7429.72 --> 7430.52]  Cause you said
[7430.52 --> 7431.50]  Can you add it to it?
[7431.56 --> 7432.72]  Can it actually do it for you?
[7432.78 --> 7432.96]  Oh
[7432.96 --> 7433.90]  Wow
[7433.90 --> 7434.16]  Okay
[7434.16 --> 7436.36]  That is very surrealist
[7436.36 --> 7437.66]  I mean that's something
[7437.66 --> 7438.18]  Yeah
[7438.18 --> 7439.98]  It is a thing
[7439.98 --> 7445.30]  Takes a minute
[7445.30 --> 7450.30]  Huh
[7450.30 --> 7451.64]  What is that?
[7452.16 --> 7452.92]  What the?
[7453.06 --> 7453.56]  I mean that's
[7453.56 --> 7454.36]  What is that chair?
[7455.24 --> 7456.22]  It's kind of like what I drew
[7456.22 --> 7456.56]  Is it
[7456.56 --> 7457.40]  Does that go
[7457.40 --> 7458.18]  Um
[7458.18 --> 7459.72]  Does that go
[7459.72 --> 7460.70]  Between your legs?
[7460.88 --> 7461.00]  Or
[7461.00 --> 7463.30]  Very smooth
[7463.30 --> 7464.32]  It's got
[7464.32 --> 7466.30]  It's got quite the headrest on there
[7466.30 --> 7467.68]  What about this chair though?
[7467.68 --> 7469.26]  Oh my
[7469.26 --> 7470.30]  Huh
[7470.30 --> 7472.40]  That's a unique design
[7472.40 --> 7477.40]  I think that this would be an amazing store
[7477.40 --> 7480.66]  AIcreations.com
[7480.66 --> 7484.18]  You just find things like this
[7484.18 --> 7484.50]  You
[7484.50 --> 7485.20]  You
[7485.20 --> 7485.64]  You
[7485.64 --> 7487.32]  Oh yeah
[7487.32 --> 7489.84]  So like you make this like impossible chair
[7489.84 --> 7490.46]  Because you just
[7490.46 --> 7491.42]  You route that
[7491.42 --> 7492.32]  Uh
[7492.32 --> 7492.62]  The
[7492.62 --> 7494.26]  The like black line that's on there
[7494.26 --> 7495.56]  Like through the top
[7495.56 --> 7496.56]  And you make it work
[7496.56 --> 7498.02]  It would be possible
[7498.02 --> 7499.28]  It would just be kind of sketch
[7499.28 --> 7499.82]  Like as
[7499.82 --> 7500.50]  That back leg
[7500.50 --> 7501.46]  That's just a spike
[7501.46 --> 7502.08]  Like um
[7502.08 --> 7502.92]  Has this been done
[7502.92 --> 7504.48]  Like as an art installation
[7504.48 --> 7505.26]  Just like
[7505.26 --> 7508.16]  You know as a commentary on AI
[7508.16 --> 7509.06]  Or whatever
[7509.06 --> 7510.52]  Just like someone creates
[7510.52 --> 7513.52]  People are already grabbing the domain
[7513.52 --> 7514.40]  Yeah
[7514.40 --> 7515.00]  I'm sure
[7515.00 --> 7515.36]  I'm sure
[7515.36 --> 7515.64]  It's over
[7515.64 --> 7516.44]  It's over
[7516.44 --> 7517.24]  I'm sure they are
[7517.24 --> 7519.24]  What are these other ones that came up with?
[7519.38 --> 7519.96]  It does
[7519.96 --> 7520.26]  Uh
[7520.26 --> 7520.56]  Hold on
[7520.56 --> 7521.10]  Hold on a second
[7521.10 --> 7521.56]  Did anyone
[7521.56 --> 7522.74]  Did anyone own it already?
[7522.74 --> 7525.64]  I'm sure there are people who just like
[7525.64 --> 7527.20]  Already have it ready to go
[7527.20 --> 7531.18]  I hate that GoDaddy is like still the fastest way to check this
[7531.18 --> 7532.08]  No man that's taken
[7532.08 --> 7532.78]  That's taken
[7532.78 --> 7533.32]  Yeah
[7533.32 --> 7535.70]  AIcreation.ca is for one cent
[7535.70 --> 7536.56]  Nice
[7536.56 --> 7537.76]  I
[7537.76 --> 7538.02]  I
[7538.02 --> 7539.92]  I kind of just want to look at some of this stuff
[7539.92 --> 7540.68]  What is this thing?
[7540.70 --> 7541.00]  What's up with that lamp?
[7541.42 --> 7541.80]  Like what is
[7541.80 --> 7542.10]  What is
[7542.10 --> 7543.76]  Luke what is this thing?
[7544.12 --> 7545.16]  I don't know
[7545.16 --> 7546.70]  It looks like a desk organizer actually
[7546.70 --> 7547.40]  What is this?
[7548.08 --> 7548.78]  It looks like
[7548.78 --> 7549.02]  Plushy
[7549.02 --> 7551.66]  Yeah it looks like somewhere between Eeyore and Ratatouille
[7551.66 --> 7552.26]  Yeah
[7552.26 --> 7557.04]  There's a measuring tape that's like partially out
[7557.04 --> 7558.26]  Just on the table
[7558.26 --> 7559.14]  Is this a balloon?
[7559.26 --> 7559.80]  A hard hat?
[7561.12 --> 7561.80]  Popcorn bowl?
[7563.44 --> 7564.34]  Impossible to say
[7564.34 --> 7566.00]  That is some art
[7566.00 --> 7566.62]  Artbuster ones
[7566.62 --> 7569.04]  It's a lot of art
[7569.04 --> 7572.46]  It's really interesting seeing the AI art within the AI art
[7572.46 --> 7572.82]  Yeah
[7572.82 --> 7573.38]  It was like
[7573.38 --> 7574.30]  Yeah I don't know
[7574.30 --> 7574.74]  Lamp
[7574.74 --> 7575.94]  I guess lamp
[7575.94 --> 7577.80]  But like worse
[7577.80 --> 7579.16]  Worlds within worlds
[7579.16 --> 7581.64]  Like what would an AI
[7581.64 --> 7582.54]  Multidimensional art
[7582.54 --> 7583.64]  What would an AI draw?
[7585.40 --> 7586.12]  That's pretty cool
[7586.12 --> 7588.44]  I mean it's not what I asked for
[7588.44 --> 7589.56]  But it's pretty cool
[7589.56 --> 7589.58]  What is it?
[7589.62 --> 7590.36]  Like how do these
[7590.36 --> 7591.68]  I just
[7591.68 --> 7594.68]  Think it just did a photorealistic scene
[7594.68 --> 7596.32]  I don't know if it really tried to
[7596.32 --> 7596.34]  Yeah
[7596.34 --> 7598.70]  I think it didn't look at what you did at all
[7598.70 --> 7602.00]  Hmm
[7602.00 --> 7603.08]  Like not even slightly
[7603.08 --> 7603.96]  Okay well why don't we
[7603.96 --> 7604.86]  Why don't we ask it for
[7604.86 --> 7606.10]  So basically then
[7606.10 --> 7607.20]  Is this any different
[7607.20 --> 7608.52]  I can't
[7608.52 --> 7610.12]  Does it look at what you've done at all
[7610.12 --> 7611.62]  Or is it just the prompt?
[7612.24 --> 7613.78]  I think it might just be a prompt
[7613.78 --> 7616.26]  There's a little information icon
[7616.26 --> 7616.96]  Just to the right of
[7616.96 --> 7617.96]  Describe what you want to see
[7617.96 --> 7618.12]  Oh yeah
[7618.12 --> 7619.26]  I wonder if that helps
[7619.26 --> 7620.48]  Thanks Dan
[7620.48 --> 7621.94]  No I mean I also don't know
[7621.94 --> 7622.90]  Powered by Dolly
[7622.90 --> 7624.60]  In AI system that creates realistic images
[7624.60 --> 7625.38]  Blah blah blah
[7625.38 --> 7627.46]  If you find a creation to be unexpected or offensive
[7627.46 --> 7628.12]  Send us feedback
[7628.12 --> 7628.92]  Yeah so no
[7628.92 --> 7629.72]  This is just
[7629.72 --> 7631.70]  I think that first image might have been slightly offensive
[7631.70 --> 7633.20]  This is just Dolly
[7633.20 --> 7634.88]  Yeah I think so
[7634.88 --> 7635.08]  Yeah
[7635.08 --> 7636.38]  So choose a style
[7636.38 --> 7637.36]  What's under choose a style?
[7640.68 --> 7641.16]  Oh
[7641.16 --> 7643.30]  Oh
[7643.30 --> 7645.24]  Oh
[7645.24 --> 7647.78]  In the style of
[7647.78 --> 7648.86]  Anime
[7648.86 --> 7651.54]  I'm excited right now
[7651.54 --> 7655.36]  I hope I'm doing a cool stance
[7655.36 --> 7656.32]  When I do it
[7656.32 --> 7659.58]  It probably won't
[7659.58 --> 7661.04]  I hope I'm like Narito running
[7661.04 --> 7663.12]  It won't show a specific person
[7663.12 --> 7663.74]  Oh
[7663.74 --> 7664.12]  Oh
[7664.12 --> 7667.06]  It's just
[7667.06 --> 7667.70]  There's like
[7667.70 --> 7669.24]  There's no actual like nose
[7669.24 --> 7670.80]  The finger's just there
[7670.80 --> 7676.22]  He's choosing where his nose is gonna go
[7676.22 --> 7677.48]  This neck thing
[7677.48 --> 7678.42]  That neck is intense
[7678.42 --> 7678.84]  Wow
[7678.84 --> 7679.96]  Those collarbones are
[7679.96 --> 7681.84]  How we doing for finger count here
[7681.84 --> 7682.22]  Hmm
[7682.22 --> 7682.54]  Whoops
[7682.54 --> 7683.22]  The fingers are
[7683.22 --> 7684.44]  There are six of them
[7684.44 --> 7685.52]  Which is fine
[7685.52 --> 7687.12]  Also this is an interesting shape
[7687.12 --> 7687.60]  Yeah
[7687.60 --> 7689.40]  Alright let's see the rest of them
[7689.40 --> 7692.82]  That one's like
[7692.82 --> 7693.92]  I'm not picking
[7693.92 --> 7694.76]  But it's better
[7694.76 --> 7695.36]  Yeah
[7695.36 --> 7695.74]  Yeah
[7695.74 --> 7696.30]  I think it's better
[7696.30 --> 7697.48]  Is that the correct amount of fingers?
[7697.60 --> 7697.82]  Nope
[7697.82 --> 7698.34]  Nope
[7698.34 --> 7698.92]  I mean well
[7698.92 --> 7699.32]  I don't know
[7699.32 --> 7699.68]  It depends
[7699.68 --> 7700.98]  It depends what this thing is
[7700.98 --> 7701.30]  Yeah
[7701.30 --> 7701.66]  Yeah
[7701.66 --> 7703.08]  Not sure what that is
[7703.08 --> 7706.46]  I think this one might be my favorite
[7706.46 --> 7708.82]  He tried to pick his nose
[7708.82 --> 7709.42]  But he missed
[7709.42 --> 7710.46]  Because his eyes were closed
[7710.46 --> 7710.70]  Yeah
[7710.70 --> 7711.30]  Yeah
[7711.30 --> 7712.08]  Okay so wait
[7712.08 --> 7713.16]  Is this actually
[7713.16 --> 7714.36]  Wait is this actually
[7714.36 --> 7717.76]  They're all kind of blonde and blue eyed
[7717.76 --> 7718.18]  Yeah
[7718.18 --> 7719.42]  Did it actually know
[7719.42 --> 7720.60]  Who I was talking about?
[7720.74 --> 7721.22]  I don't know
[7721.22 --> 7722.82]  I can't tell
[7722.82 --> 7725.24]  Theoretically you can search the internet now
[7725.24 --> 7725.94]  So like maybe
[7725.94 --> 7727.38]  Okay
[7727.38 --> 7729.76]  Do you?
[7730.42 --> 7732.52]  Luke Lafreniere from Linus Tech Tips
[7732.52 --> 7734.34]  Oh hold on
[7734.34 --> 7734.98]  Hold on
[7734.98 --> 7741.44]  As an anime girl with ears
[7741.44 --> 7746.26]  Let's see how close we can get to that artwork from earlier in the show
[7746.26 --> 7747.22]  Alright
[7747.22 --> 7747.86]  Here we go
[7747.86 --> 7748.16]  Yeah
[7748.16 --> 7749.22]  I'm very scared
[7749.22 --> 7749.68]  Lucy
[7749.68 --> 7751.10]  I don't remember the last name
[7757.38 --> 7758.30]  It's stressful
[7758.30 --> 7759.44]  I expect greatness
[7759.44 --> 7762.30]  It's apparently against Dali terms of service to do real people
[7762.30 --> 7762.86]  Oh
[7762.86 --> 7764.14]  Well that didn't stop it
[7764.14 --> 7764.36]  Oh wow
[7764.36 --> 7765.12]  Okay
[7765.12 --> 7765.80]  Hmm
[7765.80 --> 7766.28]  Huh
[7766.28 --> 7767.60]  That looks really
[7767.60 --> 7768.74]  Not anime
[7768.74 --> 7769.82]  Yeah
[7769.82 --> 7772.32]  I mean he's wearing a blue hoodie
[7772.32 --> 7772.90]  Like I think
[7772.90 --> 7775.48]  I think this is actually inspired by you though
[7775.48 --> 7776.40]  Yeah
[7776.40 --> 7778.74]  Um
[7778.74 --> 7779.48]  Hmm
[7779.48 --> 7779.94]  Hmm
[7779.94 --> 7781.54]  That's
[7781.54 --> 7782.86]  Not as close
[7782.86 --> 7783.18]  Yeah
[7783.18 --> 7784.90]  The first one was
[7784.90 --> 7786.44]  Whoa
[7786.44 --> 7789.68]  Wow
[7789.68 --> 7792.94]  There's some stuff going on
[7792.94 --> 7795.06]  There's some stuff going on here for sure
[7795.06 --> 7795.90]  Oh
[7795.90 --> 7798.90]  The cat ear things are just like behind him as well
[7798.90 --> 7800.48]  Uh no no that's the other picture
[7800.48 --> 7801.28]  No no no no
[7801.28 --> 7802.56]  Oh you mean this
[7802.56 --> 7802.76]  Yeah
[7802.76 --> 7803.02]  Okay
[7803.02 --> 7804.24]  They look more like horns
[7804.24 --> 7805.02]  Sure
[7805.02 --> 7805.50]  Okay
[7805.50 --> 7807.80]  Um
[7807.80 --> 7808.96]  I mean
[7808.96 --> 7810.30]  See it's funny
[7810.30 --> 7811.38]  Cause it's like
[7811.38 --> 7812.14]  Oh no
[7812.14 --> 7813.84]  We can't quite do that
[7813.84 --> 7815.72]  We can't have too much resemblance
[7815.72 --> 7816.20]  But like
[7816.20 --> 7817.44]  Here's a black and orange hoodie
[7817.44 --> 7817.96]  Yeah
[7817.96 --> 7818.96]  You know what I mean
[7818.96 --> 7819.34]  Yeah
[7819.34 --> 7822.24]  Here's a kind of weird neck beard
[7822.24 --> 7824.54]  So it's obviously using a very old image of you
[7824.54 --> 7827.34]  If it did use an image of you as a reference
[7827.34 --> 7829.38]  I mean that's probably what is most common
[7829.38 --> 7830.32]  You know
[7830.32 --> 7832.40]  I haven't really been in that many videos
[7832.40 --> 7833.10]  Alright here we go
[7833.10 --> 7835.28]  Let's see
[7835.28 --> 7836.52]  Oh man
[7836.52 --> 7838.80]  There's interesting reference for this
[7838.80 --> 7839.86]  Because of the
[7839.86 --> 7841.92]  The cat ear headphones
[7841.92 --> 7843.02]  Mmm
[7843.02 --> 7845.30]  And also
[7845.30 --> 7846.36]  The fact that
[7846.36 --> 7846.74]  Oh
[7846.74 --> 7848.30]  Okay
[7848.30 --> 7850.04]  Uh
[7850.04 --> 7850.28]  Yeah
[7850.28 --> 7852.62]  That looks very similar to one of the ones that
[7852.62 --> 7853.36]  Uh huh
[7853.36 --> 7854.44]  Uh
[7854.44 --> 7855.26]  Looked like me
[7855.26 --> 7857.04]  Whoa
[7857.04 --> 7859.84]  That is uh
[7859.84 --> 7860.28]  Whoa
[7860.28 --> 7860.68]  Whoa
[7860.68 --> 7864.42]  Wow
[7864.42 --> 7865.24]  Okay
[7865.24 --> 7867.82]  Should've just not even had the hand up
[7867.82 --> 7869.00]  Those neck muscles are
[7869.00 --> 7871.18]  Intense
[7871.18 --> 7871.92]  Pushing for that face
[7871.92 --> 7872.38]  And then
[7872.38 --> 7872.90]  You know what
[7872.90 --> 7873.20]  Wow
[7873.20 --> 7874.00]  That's
[7874.00 --> 7878.22]  I think the closest we're probably gonna get here
[7878.22 --> 7879.32]  Look at that right hand
[7879.32 --> 7880.66]  I mean
[7880.66 --> 7881.88]  That's a left hand
[7881.88 --> 7882.12]  But
[7882.12 --> 7882.54]  Left hand
[7882.54 --> 7882.82]  Yes
[7882.82 --> 7883.72]  Yeah
[7883.72 --> 7884.96]  You did good
[7884.96 --> 7885.56]  Um
[7885.56 --> 7889.56]  Diggs
[7889.56 --> 7890.56]  Alright so
[7890.56 --> 7891.34]  Uh
[7891.34 --> 7892.10]  Why don't we try
[7892.10 --> 7893.20]  Why don't we try one more
[7893.20 --> 7893.78]  One more thing
[7893.78 --> 7894.72]  You got any other ideas
[7894.72 --> 7895.16]  So what
[7895.16 --> 7896.68]  What would this be helpful with
[7896.68 --> 7897.14]  My favorite
[7897.14 --> 7897.96]  Is anything with
[7897.96 --> 7899.02]  Francesco Goya
[7899.02 --> 7901.14]  In the style of Francesco Goya
[7901.14 --> 7901.78]  Ah
[7901.78 --> 7903.36]  That's sort of controversial Dan
[7903.36 --> 7903.76]  Is it
[7903.76 --> 7904.10]  Okay
[7904.10 --> 7904.74]  Never mind then
[7904.74 --> 7905.52]  Yeah I think so
[7905.52 --> 7906.30]  I don't know
[7906.30 --> 7906.94]  Um
[7906.94 --> 7907.30]  Okay
[7907.30 --> 7907.58]  Okay
[7907.58 --> 7907.92]  Hold on
[7907.92 --> 7908.38]  Um
[7908.38 --> 7909.56]  Uh
[7909.56 --> 7910.46]  I want to
[7910.46 --> 7911.00]  Color
[7911.00 --> 7912.58]  Uh
[7912.58 --> 7913.08]  Uh
[7913.08 --> 7913.68]  Picture
[7914.96 --> 7916.10]  Um
[7916.10 --> 7916.58]  Or
[7916.58 --> 7918.34]  Oh this is a good idea
[7918.34 --> 7919.52]  Black and white
[7919.52 --> 7921.38]  Um
[7921.38 --> 7923.24]  Picture of a duck
[7923.24 --> 7924.82]  Um
[7924.82 --> 7925.82]  With
[7925.82 --> 7927.22]  White spaces
[7927.22 --> 7929.12]  You should be able to ask it for a paint by numbers
[7929.12 --> 7930.20]  Uh
[7930.20 --> 7930.68]  Well here
[7930.68 --> 7932.46]  Let's just see if it can give me something to color
[7932.46 --> 7932.88]  Okay
[7932.88 --> 7935.92]  So this is something I could see like a child
[7935.92 --> 7938.16]  Using it for
[7938.16 --> 7941.90]  I also want to do
[7941.90 --> 7943.06]  Uh
[7943.06 --> 7944.58]  I also want to do like
[7944.58 --> 7944.92]  Uh
[7944.92 --> 7945.36]  Oh yeah
[7945.36 --> 7945.88]  Here we go
[7945.88 --> 7947.00]  Yeah
[7947.00 --> 7947.54]  Okay
[7947.54 --> 7947.88]  Sure
[7947.88 --> 7948.64]  That looks like
[7948.64 --> 7949.44]  Perfect
[7949.44 --> 7951.16]  That one a little bit less so
[7951.16 --> 7951.96]  That one perfect
[7951.96 --> 7953.30]  Weird stuff going on with the foot there
[7953.30 --> 7953.76]  But like
[7953.76 --> 7955.06]  Yeah that's fine
[7955.06 --> 7956.00]  So if I was just
[7956.00 --> 7957.78]  Well I just mean like that's perfect for coloring
[7957.78 --> 7958.12]  Like
[7958.12 --> 7958.96]  Yeah if I was just a kid
[7958.96 --> 7962.32]  Not even commenting on the fact that it has one giant foot
[7962.32 --> 7962.92]  One giant foot
[7962.92 --> 7963.54]  That's interesting
[7963.54 --> 7964.98]  Oh it's not perfect for coloring
[7964.98 --> 7966.14]  I can't use the paint bucket
[7966.14 --> 7966.84]  Oh
[7966.84 --> 7968.04]  That's unfortunate
[7968.04 --> 7969.08]  Uh
[7969.08 --> 7969.72]  I mean you know
[7969.72 --> 7970.20]  It's kind of
[7970.20 --> 7970.56]  Flawed
[7970.56 --> 7972.14]  It's kind of got some
[7972.14 --> 7974.58]  That art style is kind of neat though actually
[7974.58 --> 7975.72]  Yeah it's cute
[7975.72 --> 7977.56]  Uh
[7977.56 --> 7979.06]  Man yeah that's very frustrating
[7979.06 --> 7980.56]  Some of those zones are real small
[7980.56 --> 7981.34]  Anyway there's the duck
[7981.34 --> 7982.28]  Um
[7982.28 --> 7983.94]  Okay I
[7983.94 --> 7984.68]  Paid by numbers
[7984.68 --> 7985.56]  Um
[7985.56 --> 7986.62]  I am
[7986.62 --> 7987.66]  Uh
[7987.66 --> 7991.44]  Uh
[7991.44 --> 7992.12]  Picture
[7992.12 --> 7993.60]  Of a tech
[7993.60 --> 7994.22]  YouTuber
[7994.22 --> 7995.66]  Background
[7995.66 --> 7996.38]  Set
[7996.38 --> 7998.72]  Uh
[7998.72 --> 7998.74]  With
[7998.74 --> 7999.42]  RGB
[7999.42 --> 8000.10]  Lights
[8000.10 --> 8000.62]  There
[8000.62 --> 8001.72]  You know
[8001.72 --> 8003.60]  So if you were looking for some inspiration
[8003.60 --> 8004.82]  Why did I leave it on anime
[8004.82 --> 8005.28]  I don't even
[8005.28 --> 8006.42]  I don't even know what I'm
[8006.42 --> 8009.80]  I don't even really know what I'm trying to do with the styles here
[8009.80 --> 8015.16]  Maybe that's why the eyes of the duck look that way
[8015.16 --> 8017.00]  Oh that would explain it
[8017.00 --> 8022.66]  Hmm
[8022.66 --> 8024.04]  Tech YouTuber background set
[8024.04 --> 8025.02]  Wow that would be expensive
[8025.02 --> 8026.28]  I mean
[8026.28 --> 8027.10]  No you just
[8027.10 --> 8027.72]  You know
[8027.72 --> 8028.80]  Ooh a tech YouTuber
[8028.80 --> 8030.32]  You just do it in green screen
[8030.32 --> 8031.14]  Wow
[8031.14 --> 8032.66]  Look at the veins on this hand
[8032.66 --> 8034.28]  Wow
[8034.28 --> 8034.88]  Ooh
[8034.88 --> 8035.48]  What is this
[8035.48 --> 8036.26]  The fingers
[8036.26 --> 8038.28]  Yeah the fingers are really weird
[8038.28 --> 8039.42]  You'd think
[8039.42 --> 8039.72]  They
[8039.72 --> 8040.28]  Like
[8040.28 --> 8040.72]  You know
[8040.72 --> 8041.90]  Would just kind of hard code
[8041.90 --> 8043.40]  That fingers can't look like that
[8043.40 --> 8043.98]  At some point
[8043.98 --> 8044.96]  Like okay yeah
[8044.96 --> 8045.96]  These are the rules
[8045.96 --> 8046.34]  Of how
[8046.34 --> 8046.90]  They're more interested in
[8046.90 --> 8047.50]  An advancement
[8047.50 --> 8048.32]  At this point
[8048.32 --> 8049.06]  Yeah that's fair
[8049.06 --> 8049.76]  I think people aren't spending
[8049.76 --> 8051.02]  As much time refining
[8051.02 --> 8052.18]  And they're just trying to move forward
[8052.18 --> 8053.40]  I mean these are not that bad
[8053.40 --> 8054.10]  There's definitely
[8054.10 --> 8056.10]  Some inspiration here
[8056.10 --> 8056.62]  If nothing else
[8056.62 --> 8057.58]  They're all kind of samey
[8057.58 --> 8058.70]  Which is sort of a bummer
[8058.70 --> 8059.68]  Blue and red
[8059.68 --> 8060.04]  Hey
[8060.04 --> 8063.50]  Interesting that the background
[8063.50 --> 8064.52]  Matches the WAN show
[8064.52 --> 8066.14]  Nice
[8066.14 --> 8069.60]  Alright
[8069.60 --> 8070.68]  Last one
[8070.68 --> 8071.56]  Last one for me
[8071.56 --> 8072.54]  And then if you want to do
[8072.54 --> 8073.38]  If you want to do one more
[8073.38 --> 8074.28]  We still can
[8074.28 --> 8077.02]  Takes a little while
[8077.02 --> 8077.58]  I
[8077.58 --> 8079.00]  I get it
[8079.00 --> 8081.44]  Okay
[8081.44 --> 8083.22]  That's kind of
[8083.22 --> 8084.24]  A cool vibe
[8084.24 --> 8085.58]  That's pretty cool actually
[8085.58 --> 8087.26]  What is on the wall
[8087.26 --> 8087.86]  What is it trying to do
[8087.86 --> 8088.82]  There's a camera there
[8088.82 --> 8089.56]  In the upper right
[8089.56 --> 8090.30]  No no no no
[8090.30 --> 8090.76]  Oh okay
[8090.76 --> 8092.74]  I think these are
[8092.74 --> 8093.92]  Supposed to be like
[8093.92 --> 8095.10]  Wall mounted computers
[8095.10 --> 8095.60]  Yeah
[8095.60 --> 8096.04]  Yeah
[8096.04 --> 8097.34]  And then you know
[8097.34 --> 8098.42]  Obviously a speaker
[8098.42 --> 8099.10]  A joystick
[8099.10 --> 8099.84]  Like
[8099.84 --> 8101.52]  What is this thing
[8101.52 --> 8101.80]  I don't know
[8101.80 --> 8102.72]  That might just be a figurine
[8102.72 --> 8104.04]  Look at this keyboard
[8104.04 --> 8105.22]  That is scuffed
[8105.22 --> 8106.10]  Whoa
[8106.10 --> 8107.42]  Whoa
[8107.42 --> 8108.46]  There's keys on like
[8108.46 --> 8109.24]  The front of it
[8109.24 --> 8109.82]  Yeah
[8109.82 --> 8111.82]  Wow
[8111.82 --> 8112.88]  Alright
[8112.88 --> 8113.54]  Cool
[8113.54 --> 8114.62]  What else we got here
[8114.62 --> 8115.88]  Man
[8115.88 --> 8117.06]  I kind of like this
[8117.06 --> 8118.82]  Speakers embedded in walls
[8118.82 --> 8120.18]  Thing that it's got going on
[8120.18 --> 8120.52]  Yeah
[8120.52 --> 8121.30]  Yeah
[8121.30 --> 8121.58]  These
[8121.58 --> 8122.26]  You know what
[8122.26 --> 8123.66]  Some of these really do
[8123.66 --> 8125.46]  Immediately give me product ideas
[8125.46 --> 8126.04]  Yeah
[8126.04 --> 8127.92]  Like just a little RGB dot
[8127.92 --> 8129.78]  That you just like put somewhere
[8129.78 --> 8130.72]  And it's just cute
[8130.72 --> 8131.36]  And it just glows
[8131.36 --> 8131.76]  Like that
[8131.76 --> 8133.00]  That's kind of awesome actually
[8133.00 --> 8133.24]  Just make it so the battery
[8133.24 --> 8134.14]  Lasts a long time
[8134.14 --> 8134.66]  Yeah
[8134.66 --> 8135.76]  Or you can plug it in
[8135.76 --> 8136.70]  Or use a battery
[8136.70 --> 8137.38]  Or whatever
[8137.38 --> 8140.68]  I don't know
[8140.68 --> 8141.50]  I don't know exactly
[8141.50 --> 8142.50]  What's going on up here
[8142.50 --> 8142.94]  But boy
[8142.94 --> 8143.68]  Is it ever something
[8143.68 --> 8144.80]  And I mean
[8144.80 --> 8146.04]  I think at this stage
[8146.04 --> 8147.58]  This is realistically
[8147.58 --> 8149.00]  More along the lines
[8149.00 --> 8149.90]  Of what you're going to be able
[8149.90 --> 8152.10]  To use an AI image generator for
[8152.10 --> 8154.36]  Oh man
[8154.36 --> 8154.96]  They're doing
[8154.96 --> 8156.06]  Close
[8156.06 --> 8156.46]  Ooh
[8156.46 --> 8157.00]  What's
[8157.00 --> 8159.36]  They're doing
[8159.36 --> 8159.94]  Close up
[8159.94 --> 8161.06]  Macro inspection
[8161.06 --> 8161.64]  Of
[8161.64 --> 8163.16]  One of their systems
[8163.16 --> 8164.04]  While they listen to
[8164.04 --> 8165.40]  Embedded wall speakers
[8165.40 --> 8165.92]  Just
[8165.92 --> 8166.30]  Yeah
[8166.30 --> 8168.32]  This embedded wall speaker thing
[8168.32 --> 8169.02]  They're pretty sick
[8169.02 --> 8169.68]  That's weird
[8169.68 --> 8170.16]  They're actually cool
[8170.16 --> 8170.82]  Yeah
[8170.82 --> 8171.82]  I kind of
[8171.82 --> 8172.36]  You know
[8172.36 --> 8173.40]  Unironically
[8173.40 --> 8174.78]  I like the design of this mic
[8174.78 --> 8175.54]  It's kind of cool
[8175.54 --> 8177.14]  Yeah
[8177.14 --> 8178.64]  I don't know exactly how it works
[8178.64 --> 8178.82]  But
[8178.82 --> 8180.44]  That stand would like
[8180.44 --> 8181.14]  Never hold that
[8181.14 --> 8182.12]  Look at this mouse
[8182.12 --> 8183.42]  Got the track ball
[8183.42 --> 8184.18]  Or I think
[8184.18 --> 8185.20]  I'm not sure
[8185.20 --> 8188.14]  Keyboards are all mangled
[8188.14 --> 8188.86]  I never realized
[8188.86 --> 8189.74]  How hard of a time
[8189.74 --> 8190.76]  It would have with keyboards
[8190.76 --> 8191.30]  Yeah
[8191.30 --> 8192.20]  It kind of makes sense
[8192.20 --> 8193.30]  Do you want to ask it
[8193.30 --> 8194.12]  To just do a keyboard
[8194.12 --> 8196.10]  We could probably do this all night
[8196.10 --> 8196.64]  We can move on
[8196.64 --> 8196.94]  Yeah
[8196.94 --> 8197.30]  Yeah
[8197.30 --> 8197.68]  That's okay
[8197.68 --> 8198.58]  You know what
[8198.58 --> 8199.36]  Yes I do
[8199.36 --> 8200.38]  Alright
[8200.38 --> 8202.24]  I do want to do that
[8202.24 --> 8202.96]  Co-creator
[8202.96 --> 8204.82]  What kind of keyboard
[8204.82 --> 8205.44]  Would you like
[8205.44 --> 8208.68]  I feel like I want to give it
[8208.68 --> 8209.48]  Something that I'll actually
[8209.48 --> 8210.28]  Be able to do
[8210.28 --> 8215.52]  I'd just say
[8215.52 --> 8216.32]  A mechanical
[8216.32 --> 8217.70]  10 keyless
[8217.70 --> 8218.14]  Mechanical
[8218.14 --> 8218.88]  Desktop keyboard
[8218.88 --> 8220.78]  Mechanical keyboard
[8220.78 --> 8221.42]  Not desktop
[8221.42 --> 8226.18]  How the heck
[8226.18 --> 8226.60]  Do you spell
[8226.60 --> 8227.40]  10 keyless
[8227.40 --> 8230.80]  It's just
[8230.80 --> 8231.34]  10
[8231.34 --> 8232.68]  I'm just going to put
[8232.68 --> 8233.28]  TKL
[8233.28 --> 8233.76]  Key
[8233.76 --> 8234.68]  Less
[8234.68 --> 8236.20]  Yeah but is it one word
[8236.20 --> 8236.54]  Yeah
[8236.54 --> 8237.96]  Are you sure
[8237.96 --> 8238.80]  That doesn't seem right
[8238.80 --> 8239.96]  I think so
[8239.96 --> 8241.22]  I could be wrong
[8241.22 --> 8241.80]  Okay
[8241.80 --> 8242.50]  Desktop
[8242.50 --> 8244.16]  Keyboard for gamers
[8244.16 --> 8245.64]  Uh
[8245.64 --> 8245.86]  Yep
[8245.86 --> 8246.58]  Okay
[8246.58 --> 8247.04]  Alright
[8247.04 --> 8247.64]  Here we go
[8247.64 --> 8248.76]  What does a keyboard
[8248.76 --> 8249.74]  For gamers look like
[8249.74 --> 8250.52]  According to
[8250.52 --> 8250.94]  Dolly
[8250.94 --> 8253.80]  And yes it's one word
[8253.80 --> 8254.60]  Cool
[8254.60 --> 8257.16]  Photorealistic
[8257.16 --> 8257.42]  Yep
[8257.42 --> 8257.78]  Okay
[8257.78 --> 8259.14]  Cool
[8259.14 --> 8261.08]  It's working on it
[8261.08 --> 8261.52]  Yeah
[8261.52 --> 8262.30]  Oh
[8262.30 --> 8264.16]  Wow
[8264.16 --> 8265.18]  These characters though
[8265.18 --> 8266.52]  I mean I guess
[8266.52 --> 8267.06]  It makes sense
[8267.06 --> 8267.58]  They would just make
[8267.58 --> 8268.20]  Their own language
[8268.20 --> 8269.04]  Why would their language
[8269.04 --> 8269.76]  Need to be
[8269.76 --> 8271.42]  Understandable by humans
[8271.42 --> 8272.28]  Yeah but Dolly's
[8272.28 --> 8273.62]  Supposed to be able to do
[8273.62 --> 8274.22]  Other more different
[8274.22 --> 8274.70]  Fishhook
[8274.70 --> 8276.08]  Proper characters now
[8276.08 --> 8277.28]  Fire coming out of the log
[8277.28 --> 8277.60]  I'm actually surprised it didn't
[8277.60 --> 8279.58]  There's some weird
[8279.58 --> 8280.76]  Extra keys at the bottom
[8280.76 --> 8281.34]  Left there
[8281.34 --> 8283.00]  Prove they weren't
[8283.00 --> 8284.04]  Intentional
[8284.04 --> 8284.50]  Yeah
[8284.50 --> 8288.00]  Ah wow
[8288.00 --> 8288.94]  Ooh
[8288.94 --> 8290.00]  This alphabet looks like
[8290.00 --> 8290.70]  My kids drew it
[8290.70 --> 8291.96]  The like depth on those
[8291.96 --> 8293.20]  Keys is pretty random
[8293.20 --> 8293.62]  Yeah
[8293.62 --> 8294.60]  Wow
[8294.60 --> 8296.86]  These are kind of
[8296.86 --> 8297.56]  Cool keycaps
[8297.56 --> 8299.28]  Assuming that
[8299.28 --> 8299.96]  They're just random
[8299.96 --> 8301.08]  Size keys though
[8301.08 --> 8301.98]  Yeah so long
[8301.98 --> 8302.58]  That they
[8302.58 --> 8303.82]  Don't move down
[8303.82 --> 8306.02]  No legend though
[8306.02 --> 8307.14]  You know hardcore mode
[8307.14 --> 8307.72]  Yeah
[8307.72 --> 8308.80]  Dan you're into it right
[8308.80 --> 8309.96]  Sorry
[8309.96 --> 8310.92]  No legend
[8310.92 --> 8312.00]  Oh hell yeah
[8312.00 --> 8312.82]  Yeah yeah
[8312.82 --> 8313.28]  I hear you
[8313.28 --> 8314.40]  Yeah a bunch of people
[8314.40 --> 8314.92]  Are saying I don't know
[8314.92 --> 8315.86]  If it used the last model
[8315.86 --> 8317.42]  I highly suspect
[8317.42 --> 8318.30]  This is a previous
[8318.30 --> 8319.22]  Version of Dolly
[8319.22 --> 8320.82]  There was a number
[8320.82 --> 8321.56]  Of things there
[8321.56 --> 8322.60]  That it did very poorly
[8322.60 --> 8323.22]  That I have
[8323.22 --> 8324.72]  Absolutely seen
[8324.72 --> 8325.30]  The newer version
[8325.30 --> 8325.92]  Do a lot better
[8325.92 --> 8328.08]  Looks like Dolly 2
[8328.08 --> 8328.78]  Yeah it kind of
[8328.78 --> 8329.24]  Feels like it
[8329.24 --> 8330.10]  The hands
[8330.10 --> 8331.12]  On modern Dolly
[8331.12 --> 8332.48]  Are way better
[8332.48 --> 8333.82]  And modern Dolly
[8333.82 --> 8334.54]  Can do
[8334.54 --> 8336.10]  Text properly
[8336.10 --> 8337.08]  Without making up
[8337.08 --> 8338.36]  Like alien language
[8338.36 --> 8339.02]  Got it
[8339.02 --> 8340.10]  So
[8340.10 --> 8340.94]  Yeah
[8340.94 --> 8342.00]  But I mean it's free
[8342.00 --> 8342.86]  In paint so
[8342.86 --> 8344.52]  Yeah well it's free
[8344.52 --> 8345.54]  Until you run out of tokens
[8345.54 --> 8346.16]  I guess but
[8346.16 --> 8347.18]  Yeah it's free for a bit
[8347.18 --> 8347.84]  Oh
[8347.84 --> 8349.30]  Are the tokens daily
[8349.30 --> 8349.84]  Or all time
[8349.84 --> 8351.40]  I'm not sure
[8351.40 --> 8353.56]  But what I do know
[8353.56 --> 8353.92]  Don't know
[8353.92 --> 8354.84]  Is that we've got a few
[8354.84 --> 8356.12]  Merch things to talk about
[8356.12 --> 8357.08]  That I kind of put off
[8357.08 --> 8357.40]  For a bit
[8357.40 --> 8358.38]  Because we spent so much
[8358.38 --> 8358.76]  Of the show
[8358.76 --> 8359.54]  Talking about merch
[8359.54 --> 8361.58]  The retro driver
[8361.58 --> 8362.66]  Is now available
[8362.66 --> 8363.64]  Technically I think
[8363.64 --> 8364.30]  It was available
[8364.30 --> 8364.98]  A week ago
[8364.98 --> 8365.68]  But we actually
[8365.68 --> 8366.40]  Never formally
[8366.40 --> 8366.76]  Were like
[8366.76 --> 8367.48]  Yeah it's available
[8367.48 --> 8368.92]  So it's a fun
[8368.92 --> 8369.54]  Retro gaming
[8369.54 --> 8371.14]  Or Frieza themed color
[8371.14 --> 8372.12]  Also our
[8372.12 --> 8373.04]  Philips and Torx
[8373.04 --> 8373.50]  Bit sets
[8373.50 --> 8374.50]  Are back in stock
[8374.50 --> 8375.46]  Oh that explains
[8375.46 --> 8376.20]  Why we sold
[8376.20 --> 8377.04]  So many bit sets
[8377.04 --> 8377.48]  That day
[8377.48 --> 8379.38]  We're also launching
[8379.38 --> 8380.56]  An upgraded magnetic
[8380.56 --> 8381.32]  Chest strap
[8381.32 --> 8382.02]  For the backpack
[8382.02 --> 8382.60]  Hmm
[8382.60 --> 8384.32]  It's
[8384.32 --> 8384.82]  Yeah
[8384.82 --> 8385.86]  Okay
[8385.86 --> 8387.22]  These are
[8387.22 --> 8388.22]  Super cool
[8388.22 --> 8388.42]  I think you've
[8388.42 --> 8389.08]  Showed me one of these
[8389.08 --> 8389.52]  Before
[8389.52 --> 8391.86]  Not down there Luke
[8391.86 --> 8393.16]  I didn't realize
[8393.16 --> 8393.92]  It was on my screen
[8393.92 --> 8394.58]  So
[8394.58 --> 8395.92]  It slides like that
[8395.92 --> 8397.52]  Nice and easy
[8397.52 --> 8398.76]  Oh yeah
[8398.76 --> 8399.64]  It kind of grabs itself
[8399.64 --> 8400.30]  So you don't have to
[8400.30 --> 8401.26]  Like I'm gonna not look
[8401.26 --> 8403.30]  There we go
[8403.30 --> 8403.90]  You don't have to
[8403.90 --> 8404.56]  Slide it at all
[8404.56 --> 8405.26]  When you put it together
[8405.26 --> 8408.34]  Oh yeah
[8408.34 --> 8409.14]  Yeah yeah yeah
[8409.14 --> 8409.76]  Isn't that cool
[8409.76 --> 8410.54]  It totally just grabs
[8410.54 --> 8411.48]  But try to rip it apart
[8411.48 --> 8412.88]  Yeah that's not gonna work
[8412.88 --> 8414.60]  I've seen these before
[8414.60 --> 8416.18]  Super cool
[8416.18 --> 8416.82]  So these are from
[8416.82 --> 8417.30]  Fidlock
[8417.30 --> 8420.00]  They are
[8420.00 --> 8421.12]  It's very easy
[8421.12 --> 8421.96]  Yeah
[8421.96 --> 8422.38]  This way
[8422.38 --> 8422.72]  Yeah
[8422.72 --> 8423.52]  As it's supposed to be
[8423.52 --> 8424.74]  But side to side
[8424.74 --> 8425.70]  It just is not gonna happen
[8425.70 --> 8426.46]  They are not cheap
[8426.46 --> 8427.60]  They are $19.99
[8427.60 --> 8429.62]  It just goes in
[8429.62 --> 8430.50]  As a drop in replacement
[8430.50 --> 8432.00]  For the stock chest strap
[8432.00 --> 8432.90]  Which just has a more
[8432.90 --> 8433.36]  Traditional
[8433.36 --> 8435.22]  I don't even know
[8435.22 --> 8435.84]  What to call it
[8435.84 --> 8436.40]  Like the kind of
[8436.40 --> 8437.22]  Anchor looking thing
[8437.22 --> 8438.28]  That goes into the other thing
[8438.28 --> 8438.62]  It's a buckle
[8438.62 --> 8439.64]  Yeah sure
[8439.64 --> 8440.92]  Yeah more traditional buckle
[8440.92 --> 8444.50]  And it's really cool
[8444.50 --> 8446.54]  We just saw these things
[8446.54 --> 8446.96]  And we were like
[8446.96 --> 8447.86]  Oh these are amazing
[8447.86 --> 8450.00]  I have some
[8450.00 --> 8450.98]  People are already like
[8450.98 --> 8451.78]  Make a belt with it
[8451.78 --> 8453.56]  That is actually
[8453.56 --> 8454.58]  Where we went first
[8454.58 --> 8456.30]  It didn't make sense
[8456.30 --> 8457.94]  It's too bulky
[8457.94 --> 8459.14]  And like getting it
[8459.14 --> 8460.18]  Through the loops
[8460.18 --> 8461.66]  Is kind of a pain in the butt
[8461.66 --> 8462.86]  And we hadn't worked
[8462.86 --> 8463.70]  On our own pants yet
[8463.70 --> 8465.34]  We could have made our pants
[8465.34 --> 8466.76]  Fidlock belt compatible
[8466.76 --> 8467.30]  But then like
[8467.30 --> 8468.26]  Okay what are we creating
[8468.26 --> 8469.20]  Like a walled garden
[8469.20 --> 8470.42]  Ecosystem of clothing
[8470.42 --> 8471.60]  That only works with each other
[8471.60 --> 8472.20]  Yeah it just didn't
[8472.20 --> 8472.98]  Really make any sense
[8472.98 --> 8474.74]  Do you want to buy this belt
[8474.74 --> 8475.42]  Do you already
[8475.42 --> 8476.96]  Do you already own LTT pants
[8476.96 --> 8477.44]  No
[8477.44 --> 8479.22]  Then forget it
[8479.22 --> 8479.80]  Can't buy it
[8479.80 --> 8480.66]  It doesn't pair properly
[8480.66 --> 8481.50]  Also we would like
[8481.50 --> 8482.98]  Some community feedback
[8482.98 --> 8484.62]  A substantial number
[8484.62 --> 8485.32]  Of the hoodies
[8485.32 --> 8486.62]  That we ordered for LTX
[8486.62 --> 8487.60]  Ended up with logos
[8487.60 --> 8488.40]  That were crooked
[8488.40 --> 8490.36]  And didn't meet our standards
[8490.36 --> 8492.12]  We are hoping
[8492.12 --> 8493.76]  To repurpose these hoodies
[8493.76 --> 8495.94]  By covering the LTX logo
[8495.94 --> 8496.64]  That's on them
[8496.64 --> 8497.08]  And crooked
[8497.08 --> 8498.86]  With something else
[8498.86 --> 8499.88]  One of the ideas
[8499.88 --> 8500.98]  Was an updated version
[8500.98 --> 8501.82]  Of our iconic
[8501.82 --> 8502.96]  WAN couch
[8502.96 --> 8505.10]  There's not really
[8505.10 --> 8505.96]  A couch in it anymore
[8505.96 --> 8506.64]  But that's okay
[8506.64 --> 8507.74]  That's a minor detail
[8507.74 --> 8509.24]  That's what it looks like
[8509.24 --> 8509.74]  I actually think
[8509.74 --> 8510.26]  It's super cool
[8510.26 --> 8511.24]  It looks pretty cool
[8511.24 --> 8512.90]  We both have beards now
[8512.90 --> 8513.56]  Yeah
[8513.56 --> 8515.94]  And we have an ugly
[8515.94 --> 8516.66]  Stretched out
[8516.66 --> 8517.84]  It looks terrible
[8517.84 --> 8518.56]  Hexagon wall
[8518.56 --> 8519.62]  But hey
[8519.62 --> 8521.40]  Is it true to real life?
[8521.78 --> 8522.02]  Yes
[8522.02 --> 8522.40]  Yes
[8522.40 --> 8524.64]  I don't make the rules
[8524.64 --> 8525.86]  Here's a mock up
[8525.86 --> 8526.84]  Of what it would look like
[8526.84 --> 8527.86]  On O'Reilly
[8527.86 --> 8529.54]  Maybe
[8529.54 --> 8530.98]  Like slightly different
[8530.98 --> 8531.84]  And less cheaply
[8531.84 --> 8532.70]  Photoshopped than that
[8532.70 --> 8533.10]  But yeah
[8533.10 --> 8534.08]  Basically that
[8534.08 --> 8535.74]  So let us know guys
[8535.74 --> 8536.52]  If you'd be interested
[8536.52 --> 8537.40]  In something like that
[8537.40 --> 8538.74]  I think we only have
[8538.74 --> 8539.86]  A few hundred of them
[8539.86 --> 8540.26]  But
[8540.26 --> 8541.58]  People are saying bread
[8541.58 --> 8542.84]  Bread?
[8543.24 --> 8543.74]  Really?
[8544.12 --> 8545.90]  I bet if you just put a bread there
[8545.90 --> 8546.44]  Are you f***ing kidding me?
[8546.44 --> 8547.74]  It would totally work
[8547.74 --> 8549.94]  I mean they're just patches
[8549.94 --> 8551.30]  Like we can get different patches
[8551.30 --> 8551.70]  I guess
[8551.70 --> 8552.24]  We could just have
[8552.24 --> 8553.12]  Multiple different patches
[8553.12 --> 8554.12]  Don't tell people
[8554.12 --> 8555.22]  That you can do that
[8555.22 --> 8556.82]  Don't tell people
[8556.82 --> 8557.20]  That you can get
[8557.20 --> 8557.78]  Different patches
[8557.78 --> 8558.98]  I mean it's too late
[8558.98 --> 8561.06]  Convoy says
[8561.06 --> 8561.86]  VTuber girls
[8561.86 --> 8562.82]  Yeah we should throw
[8562.82 --> 8565.86]  Lino and Lucy at it
[8565.86 --> 8567.36]  There you go
[8567.36 --> 8572.42]  Why do I even do this?
[8573.92 --> 8574.20]  Fine
[8574.20 --> 8575.66]  Stop hating money
[8575.66 --> 8577.48]  Why do I even talk to you?
[8578.84 --> 8579.98]  Actually you guys are
[8579.98 --> 8581.36]  Nice
[8581.36 --> 8586.32]  The chat's just bread
[8586.32 --> 8589.04]  Make the spot Velcro
[8589.04 --> 8590.14]  And sell the patches
[8590.14 --> 8590.76]  On the store
[8590.76 --> 8593.54]  I hate that
[8593.54 --> 8594.46]  That's the smartest thing
[8594.46 --> 8594.90]  I've ever heard
[8594.90 --> 8595.66]  That's a pretty
[8595.66 --> 8596.76]  Interesting idea
[8596.76 --> 8598.16]  The modular tie dye shirt
[8598.16 --> 8598.86]  Please do that
[8598.86 --> 8599.54]  Imagine you came to
[8599.54 --> 8600.54]  One of the whale lands
[8600.54 --> 8601.04]  So we have
[8601.04 --> 8602.22]  We have clothing DLC
[8602.22 --> 8603.06]  Yeah
[8603.06 --> 8604.06]  Let's go
[8604.06 --> 8604.50]  Yeah
[8604.50 --> 8606.68]  The DLC sweater
[8606.68 --> 8606.98]  You could
[8606.98 --> 8607.92]  Oh my god
[8607.92 --> 8608.70]  The patch
[8608.70 --> 8609.80]  Could be
[8609.80 --> 8610.84]  The same
[8610.84 --> 8611.70]  But could go on
[8611.70 --> 8612.50]  Multiple products
[8612.50 --> 8613.96]  So you could put the patch
[8613.96 --> 8614.94]  On your backpack
[8614.94 --> 8618.12]  Alright
[8618.12 --> 8619.00]  Linus
[8619.00 --> 8619.86]  Send that email
[8619.86 --> 8621.32]  Come on
[8621.32 --> 8622.20]  Thank you
[8622.20 --> 8624.24]  Thank you
[8624.24 --> 8626.04]  From all of us
[8626.04 --> 8627.60]  That's pretty cool
[8627.60 --> 8628.30]  I like that a lot
[8628.30 --> 8628.88]  Yeah
[8628.88 --> 8631.00]  Alright
[8631.00 --> 8631.62]  Okay well
[8631.62 --> 8632.62]  Do a merch message
[8632.62 --> 8633.00]  Or something
[8633.00 --> 8633.80]  People like it
[8633.80 --> 8634.82]  Yeah I know
[8634.82 --> 8635.78]  It's pretty cool
[8635.78 --> 8636.88]  It's pretty cool
[8636.88 --> 8637.90]  That's sweet
[8637.90 --> 8638.22]  Alright
[8638.22 --> 8638.98]  Okay
[8638.98 --> 8640.28]  I'll give it to you
[8640.28 --> 8642.34]  And we'll do the bread
[8642.34 --> 8643.30]  Just to thank you
[8643.30 --> 8644.24]  For the cool idea
[8644.24 --> 8647.52]  Got him
[8647.52 --> 8648.90]  Thank you floodplain chat
[8648.90 --> 8651.34]  Patches bonus bin
[8651.34 --> 8652.06]  Yeah maybe
[8652.06 --> 8652.80]  I don't know how much
[8652.80 --> 8653.96]  A patch costs
[8653.96 --> 8654.70]  I have no idea
[8654.70 --> 8659.38]  Okay
[8659.38 --> 8660.72]  Geez
[8660.72 --> 8661.52]  Yeah you can even
[8661.52 --> 8662.66]  Make the velcro
[8662.66 --> 8663.24]  In a logo
[8663.24 --> 8664.00]  Or a pattern
[8664.00 --> 8665.24]  So that it looks
[8665.24 --> 8665.92]  Good without
[8665.92 --> 8666.54]  A patch
[8666.54 --> 8667.34]  You could do the
[8667.34 --> 8668.38]  LTT logo
[8668.38 --> 8669.08]  In velcro
[8669.08 --> 8669.52]  Probably
[8669.52 --> 8670.18]  With the stitching
[8670.18 --> 8671.04]  And stuff like that
[8671.04 --> 8671.72]  That might actually
[8671.72 --> 8672.56]  Not be that easy
[8672.56 --> 8673.48]  That sounds really hard
[8673.48 --> 8673.90]  Yeah because
[8673.90 --> 8675.16]  You have to sew on
[8675.16 --> 8675.88]  The velcro
[8675.88 --> 8677.08]  Oh
[8677.08 --> 8678.16]  You have to follow
[8678.16 --> 8678.20]  The whole thing
[8678.20 --> 8678.94]  It's going to need to be
[8678.94 --> 8679.90]  Just a patch
[8679.90 --> 8680.44]  Probably
[8680.44 --> 8681.20]  But well
[8681.20 --> 8682.74]  Could you do
[8682.74 --> 8683.82]  Different colors
[8683.82 --> 8685.80]  Of the velcro
[8685.80 --> 8687.42]  So could it be
[8687.42 --> 8688.06]  Like a square
[8688.06 --> 8688.56]  But be
[8688.56 --> 8689.54]  Have orange LTT
[8689.54 --> 8690.38]  In the middle
[8690.38 --> 8690.98]  Have you ever heard
[8690.98 --> 8692.06]  The term scope creep
[8692.06 --> 8694.22]  Oh can the velcro
[8694.22 --> 8695.12]  Have a dark mode
[8695.12 --> 8696.10]  Oh
[8696.10 --> 8701.14]  Here
[8701.14 --> 8702.16]  While Linus sends that email
[8702.16 --> 8703.04]  I got one for you Luke
[8703.04 --> 8704.66]  Before you come over here
[8704.66 --> 8705.58]  And strangle me
[8705.58 --> 8708.04]  Hello lads
[8708.04 --> 8709.08]  Love the content
[8709.08 --> 8710.08]  And got into
[8710.08 --> 8710.62]  IT
[8710.62 --> 8711.82]  Because of LTT
[8711.82 --> 8712.40]  Nice
[8712.40 --> 8713.34]  If you guys had to
[8713.34 --> 8714.46]  Completely rebuild
[8714.46 --> 8715.70]  Your technical infrastructure
[8715.70 --> 8716.60]  From scratch
[8716.60 --> 8718.04]  What would you do differently
[8718.04 --> 8722.78]  This question changes a lot
[8722.78 --> 8723.66]  If you say like
[8723.66 --> 8724.28]  With the information
[8724.28 --> 8725.14]  We had at the time
[8725.14 --> 8725.72]  Or not
[8725.72 --> 8726.68]  Because honestly
[8726.68 --> 8727.50]  I stand by
[8727.50 --> 8728.58]  The technical decisions
[8728.58 --> 8729.26]  That we made
[8729.26 --> 8730.94]  But
[8730.94 --> 8731.92]  If I could have been
[8731.92 --> 8733.18]  Completely clairvoyant
[8733.18 --> 8734.60]  I would have moved
[8734.60 --> 8735.18]  To TypeScript
[8735.18 --> 8736.68]  And react a little bit sooner
[8736.68 --> 8738.84]  And would not have
[8738.84 --> 8740.16]  Would absolutely not
[8740.16 --> 8741.12]  Hitched my horse
[8741.12 --> 8741.76]  To sales
[8741.76 --> 8743.50]  That's the biggest one
[8743.50 --> 8744.82]  But sales looked
[8744.82 --> 8745.54]  Really promising
[8745.54 --> 8746.10]  At the time
[8746.10 --> 8746.46]  And like
[8746.46 --> 8747.44]  A lot of these
[8747.44 --> 8748.28]  Language
[8748.28 --> 8749.30]  Or framework
[8749.30 --> 8749.90]  Or platform
[8749.90 --> 8750.66]  Or whatever decisions
[8750.66 --> 8751.46]  That you end up making
[8751.46 --> 8754.28]  You just kind of
[8754.28 --> 8755.04]  Gotta go off
[8755.04 --> 8756.02]  What you have
[8756.02 --> 8757.00]  And when a lot
[8757.00 --> 8757.58]  Of these things
[8757.58 --> 8758.32]  Are maintained
[8758.32 --> 8758.94]  By
[8758.94 --> 8760.92]  Companies
[8760.92 --> 8762.66]  In the case
[8762.66 --> 8763.10]  Of some of them
[8763.10 --> 8763.42]  Where like
[8763.42 --> 8764.30]  Maybe it's Facebook
[8764.30 --> 8765.20]  Maintaining the language
[8765.20 --> 8766.10]  Maybe Facebook
[8766.10 --> 8766.76]  Just decides
[8766.76 --> 8767.70]  We don't want
[8767.70 --> 8768.24]  This thing anymore
[8768.24 --> 8768.68]  Who cares
[8768.68 --> 8769.44]  And then they'll
[8769.44 --> 8770.00]  Just dump it
[8770.00 --> 8770.54]  And then it's not
[8770.54 --> 8770.84]  Going to be
[8770.84 --> 8771.50]  Supported for you
[8771.50 --> 8771.78]  Anymore
[8771.78 --> 8772.34]  Or
[8772.34 --> 8773.60]  It's a completely
[8773.60 --> 8774.38]  Open source thing
[8774.38 --> 8775.00]  And the maintainer
[8775.00 --> 8775.74]  Might just disappear
[8775.74 --> 8776.44]  Yeah you could
[8776.44 --> 8777.22]  Pick up that torch
[8777.22 --> 8778.42]  But
[8778.42 --> 8779.54]  Now you're doing
[8779.54 --> 8780.86]  A wild amount
[8780.86 --> 8781.48]  More work
[8781.48 --> 8782.18]  Than you originally
[8782.18 --> 8782.88]  Intended to
[8782.88 --> 8784.22]  Because your goal
[8784.22 --> 8784.78]  Was to make this
[8784.78 --> 8785.62]  Thing on top of it
[8785.62 --> 8785.94]  Not
[8785.94 --> 8786.70]  It
[8786.70 --> 8787.62]  And now you're
[8787.62 --> 8788.12]  Doing both
[8788.12 --> 8788.74]  You might not
[8788.74 --> 8789.18]  Have enough time
[8789.18 --> 8789.46]  For that
[8789.46 --> 8789.90]  You might not
[8789.90 --> 8790.46]  Have enough budget
[8790.46 --> 8790.90]  For that
[8790.90 --> 8791.32]  To be able to
[8791.32 --> 8791.70]  Bring in more
[8791.70 --> 8792.50]  Developers and stuff
[8792.50 --> 8794.36]  So it is what it is
[8794.36 --> 8794.92]  You're going to
[8794.92 --> 8795.44]  Make some mistakes
[8795.44 --> 8795.88]  Sometimes
[8795.88 --> 8796.72]  That's how it goes
[8796.72 --> 8798.90]  I got something
[8798.90 --> 8799.46]  Good for you
[8799.46 --> 8800.86]  Dealerships
[8800.86 --> 8802.42]  Can't shift EVs
[8802.42 --> 8804.14]  Around 4,000
[8804.14 --> 8805.58]  American auto dealerships
[8805.58 --> 8806.72]  Have signed an open letter
[8806.72 --> 8807.84]  Asking the federal government
[8807.84 --> 8808.50]  To moderate
[8808.50 --> 8810.20]  Its EV adoption targets
[8810.20 --> 8810.86]  Because they are
[8810.86 --> 8812.08]  Struggling to offload
[8812.08 --> 8812.90]  An excess supply
[8812.90 --> 8813.94]  Of electric vehicles
[8813.94 --> 8815.42]  Despite EV sales
[8815.42 --> 8816.70]  Hitting record highs
[8816.70 --> 8817.86]  They currently have
[8817.86 --> 8819.44]  Over a 90 day
[8819.44 --> 8820.44]  Supply of EVs
[8820.44 --> 8821.66]  Only a 30 day
[8821.66 --> 8822.40]  Supply of internal
[8822.40 --> 8823.40]  Combustion engine vehicles
[8823.40 --> 8824.48]  And a mere two weeks
[8824.48 --> 8825.44]  Supply of hybrid
[8825.44 --> 8826.56]  Electric vehicles
[8826.56 --> 8826.98]  Tesla
[8826.98 --> 8828.40]  Leading seller of EVs
[8828.40 --> 8829.62]  Is not included in these numbers
[8829.62 --> 8830.40]  Due to its direct
[8830.40 --> 8831.18]  Consumer model
[8831.18 --> 8832.72]  There's a bunch of
[8832.72 --> 8833.40]  Other stuff in here
[8833.40 --> 8835.60]  But my point is
[8835.60 --> 8837.04]  I was right
[8837.04 --> 8842.14]  Chevy Volt
[8842.14 --> 8843.46]  Dude yeah
[8843.46 --> 8844.30]  The hybrid electric
[8844.30 --> 8846.94]  I want a hybrid electric
[8846.94 --> 8848.54]  Acura TL
[8848.54 --> 8850.24]  I would be so happy
[8850.24 --> 8852.60]  Back when I bought the Volt
[8852.60 --> 8854.06]  The only reason I bought it
[8854.06 --> 8855.26]  Was that
[8855.26 --> 8857.24]  The traditional car companies
[8857.24 --> 8857.68]  Honda
[8857.68 --> 8858.26]  Do you know how many
[8858.26 --> 8859.12]  Honda Clarities
[8859.12 --> 8860.58]  They allegedly
[8860.58 --> 8861.60]  This is just
[8861.60 --> 8862.54]  Based on
[8862.54 --> 8863.20]  Hearsay
[8863.20 --> 8864.30]  From a random
[8864.30 --> 8864.88]  Honda dealer
[8864.88 --> 8865.50]  So I don't know
[8865.50 --> 8866.36]  If it's accurate or not
[8866.36 --> 8867.42]  But apparently
[8867.42 --> 8868.08]  It was like
[8868.08 --> 8869.60]  Less than 20 Clarities
[8869.60 --> 8870.20]  I was gonna say
[8870.20 --> 8870.90]  I thought it was like
[8870.90 --> 8871.30]  Four
[8871.30 --> 8872.56]  Entire model year
[8872.56 --> 8873.74]  And I think it was
[8873.74 --> 8874.66]  A lot less than that
[8874.66 --> 8875.94]  But I am going higher
[8875.94 --> 8876.88]  Than what I recall
[8876.88 --> 8877.60]  Just to make sure
[8877.60 --> 8879.04]  That's a greater chance
[8879.04 --> 8879.64]  That it's right
[8879.64 --> 8880.66]  It was like
[8880.66 --> 8881.60]  I've seen like
[8881.60 --> 8882.46]  Two on the road
[8882.46 --> 8883.32]  Ever
[8883.32 --> 8884.84]  It was
[8884.84 --> 8885.94]  It was
[8885.94 --> 8886.76]  It was the car
[8886.76 --> 8887.58]  I wanted to buy
[8887.58 --> 8889.26]  Because it has
[8889.26 --> 8890.62]  The advantages of EV
[8890.62 --> 8891.60]  I get to drive
[8891.60 --> 8892.56]  In the HOV lane
[8892.56 --> 8893.78]  I get to
[8893.78 --> 8895.74]  Not burn gas
[8895.74 --> 8896.74]  On my daily commute
[8896.74 --> 8898.06]  And it has the advantages
[8898.06 --> 8899.40]  Of a gasoline car
[8899.40 --> 8900.46]  In that I can
[8900.46 --> 8901.50]  Go long distances
[8901.50 --> 8902.62]  And quickly refuel
[8902.62 --> 8903.42]  Without having to worry
[8903.42 --> 8904.16]  About finding
[8904.16 --> 8905.38]  Public charging infrastructure
[8905.38 --> 8908.24]  It was so obvious
[8908.24 --> 8910.54]  But only because
[8910.54 --> 8912.40]  I happen to be
[8912.40 --> 8913.64]  A tech nerd
[8913.64 --> 8914.60]  And did a whole bunch
[8914.60 --> 8915.76]  Of research into it
[8915.76 --> 8916.62]  And I am pragmatic
[8916.62 --> 8917.46]  To a fault
[8917.46 --> 8918.76]  Most people that I know
[8918.76 --> 8919.66]  That know of
[8919.66 --> 8920.88]  Like good hybrids
[8920.88 --> 8921.44]  Like the Volt
[8921.44 --> 8922.66]  Or sorry
[8922.66 --> 8923.52]  Most people that I know
[8923.52 --> 8924.32]  Don't know about
[8924.32 --> 8925.36]  Good hybrids like the Volt
[8925.36 --> 8925.70]  Yeah
[8925.70 --> 8927.18]  And the problem
[8927.18 --> 8928.40]  Is that the dealers
[8928.40 --> 8929.30]  Apparently just
[8929.30 --> 8930.04]  Had no idea
[8930.04 --> 8930.68]  What was going on
[8930.68 --> 8931.20]  And people didn't
[8931.20 --> 8931.82]  Understand it
[8931.82 --> 8932.78]  I remember talking
[8932.78 --> 8933.58]  To this other guy
[8933.58 --> 8934.02]  At a dealer
[8934.02 --> 8934.82]  Who was like
[8934.82 --> 8935.34]  Yeah this guy
[8935.34 --> 8936.30]  Traded in his Volt
[8936.30 --> 8937.34]  And I was like
[8937.34 --> 8938.22]  Talking to him about it
[8938.22 --> 8938.78]  And he was like
[8938.78 --> 8939.94]  Yeah sorry what
[8939.94 --> 8941.10]  I just put gas in it
[8941.10 --> 8941.60]  The whole time
[8941.60 --> 8942.66]  He drove it for years
[8942.66 --> 8945.10]  And I'm just
[8945.10 --> 8945.90]  I'm sitting here going
[8945.90 --> 8947.74]  Are you kidding me
[8947.74 --> 8947.90]  Just
[8947.90 --> 8948.10]  What
[8948.10 --> 8949.64]  You don't
[8949.64 --> 8950.40]  It doesn't even have
[8950.40 --> 8951.26]  To be in your garage
[8951.26 --> 8951.94]  You can just run
[8951.94 --> 8952.74]  Extensio cord
[8952.74 --> 8954.22]  It comes with a charger
[8954.22 --> 8955.38]  That just plugs into the wall
[8955.38 --> 8956.54]  There's literally
[8956.54 --> 8957.34]  No reason
[8957.34 --> 8959.00]  In BC Canada
[8959.00 --> 8959.72]  It's free real estate
[8959.72 --> 8961.36]  There is no reason
[8961.36 --> 8962.36]  Not to use
[8962.36 --> 8964.12]  The cheap
[8964.12 --> 8965.38]  Cheap
[8965.38 --> 8966.96]  Electric power
[8966.96 --> 8967.82]  That we have
[8967.82 --> 8968.52]  Yeah it's like
[8968.52 --> 8969.04]  The only thing
[8969.04 --> 8970.34]  We have going for us
[8970.34 --> 8971.46]  Financially
[8971.46 --> 8971.62]  And it's like
[8971.62 --> 8973.26]  Toyota figured it out
[8973.26 --> 8974.60]  Like the
[8974.60 --> 8975.96]  Prius Prime sucked
[8975.96 --> 8977.12]  The first couple generations
[8977.12 --> 8978.32]  I shouldn't say it sucked
[8978.32 --> 8979.84]  But the range was not enough
[8979.84 --> 8981.62]  Not enough for my daily commute
[8981.62 --> 8983.18]  Not enough for a lot of people's
[8983.18 --> 8985.10]  And so you'd have to put gas in it
[8985.10 --> 8986.52]  On a very very regular basis
[8986.52 --> 8987.74]  I believe the latest model
[8987.74 --> 8989.90]  Has way better all electric range
[8989.90 --> 8992.78]  And the RAV4 Prime is killing it
[8992.78 --> 8994.36]  I have no idea how long
[8994.36 --> 8996.12]  The wait list is for that thing now
[8996.12 --> 8997.38]  But it was just
[8997.38 --> 8999.70]  Everyone was going
[8999.70 --> 9002.16]  Oh the problem with gas is
[9002.16 --> 9003.26]  You know this
[9003.26 --> 9004.54]  It's just gas emissions
[9004.54 --> 9005.44]  Now and forever
[9005.44 --> 9006.94]  And gas is super expensive
[9006.94 --> 9007.98]  And blah blah blah
[9007.98 --> 9009.06]  And the problem with
[9009.06 --> 9009.96]  All electric
[9009.96 --> 9011.52]  Is the range
[9011.52 --> 9013.06]  And these batteries
[9013.06 --> 9014.08]  That are so costly
[9014.08 --> 9015.60]  And environmentally devastating
[9015.60 --> 9016.84]  To extract from the earth
[9016.84 --> 9018.64]  If only there was some solution
[9018.64 --> 9019.60]  But there isn't
[9019.60 --> 9023.32]  And it was staring them in the face
[9023.32 --> 9024.28]  The whole time
[9024.28 --> 9025.32]  And not to single out
[9025.32 --> 9025.90]  A person
[9025.90 --> 9026.46]  Yeah
[9026.46 --> 9027.44]  But a person
[9027.44 --> 9027.90]  123
[9027.90 --> 9029.38]  On floatplane
[9029.38 --> 9030.28]  Said
[9030.28 --> 9032.06]  The big problem with plug-in
[9032.06 --> 9034.32]  Sorry my throat's still
[9034.32 --> 9034.94]  A little bit messed up
[9034.94 --> 9036.72]  But the big problem with plug-in hybrids
[9036.72 --> 9037.54]  Is you have the cost
[9037.54 --> 9038.64]  And weight of both drive trains
[9038.64 --> 9040.78]  Not really my need
[9040.78 --> 9041.44]  Not quite
[9041.44 --> 9043.90]  Because you also don't have the weight
[9043.90 --> 9045.56]  Of all those batteries
[9045.56 --> 9047.52]  And you also don't need
[9047.52 --> 9049.14]  The same kind of
[9049.14 --> 9049.90]  Chutzpah
[9049.90 --> 9051.08]  In your ice
[9051.08 --> 9052.64]  Drive train
[9052.64 --> 9053.76]  Right
[9053.76 --> 9054.76]  And you're not running it
[9054.76 --> 9055.60]  Because that's the thing
[9055.60 --> 9056.30]  Like the Volt
[9056.30 --> 9057.18]  For all of it's
[9057.18 --> 9058.14]  Being generally
[9058.14 --> 9059.88]  A very boring dad car
[9059.88 --> 9061.74]  Actually not that bad
[9061.74 --> 9062.72]  Right off the line
[9062.72 --> 9063.88]  Because it uses the battery
[9063.88 --> 9066.12]  It uses the electric motors
[9066.12 --> 9067.80]  And the Volt's a weird one
[9067.80 --> 9070.10]  Because it's technically an EV
[9070.10 --> 9072.28]  With an onboard gasoline generator
[9072.28 --> 9072.86]  Yeah
[9072.86 --> 9073.58]  Right
[9073.58 --> 9075.68]  But like at the end of the day
[9075.68 --> 9076.68]  I sort of don't really care
[9076.68 --> 9077.32]  How you do it
[9077.32 --> 9077.48]  Yeah
[9077.48 --> 9078.14]  As a consumer
[9078.14 --> 9079.42]  All I care about is
[9079.42 --> 9081.10]  Well I've got enough power
[9081.10 --> 9082.00]  That I can pass someone
[9082.00 --> 9082.74]  If I need to
[9082.74 --> 9084.30]  And they can be very efficient
[9084.30 --> 9085.82]  Very very efficient
[9085.82 --> 9086.62]  You're talking about the weight
[9086.62 --> 9087.96]  They can be crazy efficient
[9087.96 --> 9089.74]  Even if you are peak dumb
[9089.74 --> 9091.34]  And never plug in your Volt
[9091.34 --> 9094.10]  It is a crazy efficient gasoline car
[9094.10 --> 9094.50]  Yeah
[9094.50 --> 9096.10]  It's just way too expensive
[9096.10 --> 9097.46]  Because you paid for a bunch of batteries
[9097.46 --> 9098.34]  That you're not using
[9098.34 --> 9099.54]  Because you're a big big dumb dumb
[9099.54 --> 9100.10]  That was dumb
[9100.10 --> 9101.06]  But the like
[9101.06 --> 9102.40]  Plug in hybrid Priuses
[9102.40 --> 9103.68]  Crazy efficient
[9103.68 --> 9105.30]  The plug in hybrid Volt's
[9105.30 --> 9106.38]  Crazy efficient
[9106.38 --> 9108.08]  I'm not worried about the extra weight
[9108.08 --> 9108.38]  Yeah
[9108.38 --> 9109.08]  And man
[9109.08 --> 9110.66]  I remember talking about this
[9110.66 --> 9112.68]  Back when we were going into the pandemic
[9112.68 --> 9115.84]  GM cancelled the Volt
[9115.84 --> 9118.32]  At the worst possible time
[9118.32 --> 9121.96]  They would have sold so many Volts
[9121.96 --> 9123.56]  Because the big problem with it
[9123.56 --> 9124.78]  Was that it was expensive
[9124.78 --> 9126.42]  With a value proposition
[9126.42 --> 9128.18]  That was difficult for people to understand
[9128.18 --> 9129.10]  And then all of a sudden
[9129.10 --> 9131.24]  Cars were just generally more expensive
[9131.24 --> 9132.78]  So they could have made margin on it
[9132.78 --> 9134.74]  And gasoline went through the roof
[9134.74 --> 9135.10]  Yeah
[9135.10 --> 9135.58]  And it's like
[9135.58 --> 9136.74]  Oh whoops
[9136.74 --> 9137.92]  Like they
[9137.92 --> 9140.64]  They would have sold thousands and thousands
[9140.64 --> 9141.58]  And thousands of them
[9141.58 --> 9141.94]  Yeah
[9141.94 --> 9143.48]  GM hates money
[9143.48 --> 9145.02]  Says William Comart
[9145.02 --> 9145.48]  Yeah
[9145.48 --> 9147.20]  I know right
[9147.20 --> 9151.32]  It's like they try to make the worst possible decisions
[9151.32 --> 9154.20]  I just don't know how to deal with it
[9154.20 --> 9155.78]  Like to be clear
[9155.78 --> 9156.98]  I'm not like a fan or anything
[9156.98 --> 9157.66]  I don't care
[9157.66 --> 9159.66]  But just that car
[9159.66 --> 9161.14]  It just made so much sense
[9161.14 --> 9163.34]  It just made so much sense
[9163.34 --> 9166.28]  And it's validating I guess
[9166.28 --> 9167.24]  To see everyone going
[9167.24 --> 9168.52]  Well this makes sense
[9168.52 --> 9171.02]  Yeah that's why they only have two weeks of stock
[9171.02 --> 9172.28]  Of hybrid electric vehicles
[9172.28 --> 9174.42]  Because they're so awesome
[9174.42 --> 9176.92]  They're a great middle ground
[9176.92 --> 9180.78]  Yeah people are not into GM
[9180.78 --> 9182.04]  And their decisions in general
[9182.04 --> 9184.42]  I am into plug-in hybrids though
[9184.42 --> 9187.44]  I would like to eventually have one
[9187.44 --> 9190.78]  That's the only thing I feel like I'm lacking with my car
[9190.78 --> 9191.78]  Literally
[9191.78 --> 9193.16]  Love my Volt so much
[9193.16 --> 9194.22]  That after I replaced it
[9194.22 --> 9195.46]  I bought it from myself
[9195.46 --> 9197.26]  Seriously
[9197.26 --> 9197.78]  The car
[9197.78 --> 9199.30]  The company owns it now
[9199.30 --> 9200.92]  And we just use it to run little errands
[9200.92 --> 9202.24]  Which makes a ton of sense
[9202.24 --> 9203.56]  Perfect for that
[9203.56 --> 9203.76]  It's perfect
[9203.76 --> 9204.12]  Because again
[9204.12 --> 9204.42]  Perfect
[9204.42 --> 9205.20]  The plug-in hybrid
[9205.20 --> 9208.06]  It's going to be borderline free
[9208.06 --> 9209.36]  To drive back and forth
[9209.36 --> 9210.88]  Between the office buildings
[9210.88 --> 9212.14]  It's going to be borderline free
[9212.14 --> 9212.88]  To run into town
[9212.88 --> 9214.04]  And grab something and come back
[9214.04 --> 9216.08]  And then if it needs to run really far
[9216.08 --> 9216.62]  Then it can
[9216.62 --> 9217.98]  No problem
[9217.98 --> 9219.46]  We have to go pick up a CRT
[9219.46 --> 9220.52]  In the interior of BC
[9220.52 --> 9220.76]  Sure
[9220.76 --> 9221.38]  Because we don't want to ship it
[9221.38 --> 9221.70]  For whatever
[9221.70 --> 9223.18]  Send it
[9223.18 --> 9223.90]  No problem
[9223.90 --> 9224.26]  Send it
[9224.26 --> 9224.90]  Super efficient
[9224.90 --> 9225.42]  Yep
[9225.42 --> 9226.16]  Comfortable
[9226.16 --> 9227.18]  Easy going
[9227.18 --> 9228.44]  At Linus
[9228.44 --> 9230.82]  That car made no sense on Transformers
[9230.82 --> 9232.56]  What?
[9232.66 --> 9233.12]  Like the movie?
[9234.38 --> 9234.90]  What?
[9235.24 --> 9236.84]  The Volt was in Transformers?
[9237.28 --> 9237.86]  I believe so
[9237.86 --> 9238.72]  Okay that
[9238.72 --> 9239.24]  What?
[9239.50 --> 9240.08]  Really?
[9240.98 --> 9241.24]  Why?
[9241.24 --> 9243.06]  Chevy Volt Transformers
[9243.06 --> 9247.04]  That is not how I might have promoted it
[9247.04 --> 9247.88]  Interesting
[9247.88 --> 9248.50]  Get a super car?
[9248.80 --> 9249.32]  No
[9249.32 --> 9250.94]  Oh wow
[9250.94 --> 9251.92]  I can't afford that
[9251.92 --> 9252.54]  Jolt
[9252.54 --> 9254.72]  This was an
[9254.72 --> 9255.36]  Okay
[9255.36 --> 9257.08]  This was a huge
[9257.08 --> 9258.88]  This was a huge problem for Chevy
[9258.88 --> 9259.98]  They had the Bolt
[9259.98 --> 9260.88]  Okay
[9260.88 --> 9263.34]  Which was like an entry level EV
[9263.34 --> 9265.42]  They had the Volt
[9265.42 --> 9268.28]  Which was a completely different car
[9268.28 --> 9269.72]  The plug in hybrid vehicle
[9269.72 --> 9271.38]  And now
[9271.38 --> 9272.98]  I'm only just learning about this
[9272.98 --> 9273.66]  They had
[9273.66 --> 9274.50]  Jolt
[9274.50 --> 9276.12]  A character
[9276.12 --> 9277.72]  From Transformers
[9277.72 --> 9279.02]  That is a Volt
[9279.02 --> 9281.40]  Are you kidding me?
[9281.40 --> 9282.64]  That's really stupid
[9282.64 --> 9283.96]  It also looks really stupid
[9283.96 --> 9286.90]  Like the Transformer looks dumb
[9286.90 --> 9288.44]  Ah
[9288.44 --> 9290.54]  I'm sad now
[9290.54 --> 9292.70]  Very sad
[9292.70 --> 9295.74]  They're like Nintendo Wii U'd this car
[9295.74 --> 9299.22]  It's like what?
[9301.16 --> 9302.76]  Looks like Bumblebee but dumber
[9302.76 --> 9303.28]  Yeah
[9303.28 --> 9305.86]  I thought that like
[9305.86 --> 9306.96]  Bumblebee's dumb cousin
[9306.96 --> 9308.98]  Translucent blue thing under him
[9308.98 --> 9309.82]  Was like his beard
[9309.82 --> 9310.80]  They're flying
[9310.80 --> 9312.40]  They're flying electric vehicle
[9312.40 --> 9313.16]  Called the Molt
[9313.16 --> 9313.88]  Yeah
[9313.88 --> 9314.96]  Like exactly
[9314.96 --> 9315.34]  That's what
[9315.34 --> 9317.30]  It's really close to Moltres
[9317.30 --> 9320.88]  I started playing Pokemon Go recently
[9320.88 --> 9322.32]  Makes me so sad
[9322.32 --> 9323.74]  I want to go and get my Colt
[9323.74 --> 9324.82]  Sorry
[9324.82 --> 9326.92]  Sorry
[9326.92 --> 9328.46]  You're not playing Final Fantasy 6
[9328.46 --> 9329.46]  I'm ahead in the challenge
[9329.46 --> 9329.88]  Is that
[9329.88 --> 9330.52]  No yeah
[9330.52 --> 9331.26]  Is that what you're saying?
[9331.36 --> 9333.06]  So I'm still like mildly sick
[9333.06 --> 9334.20]  So I haven't been able to go to the gym
[9334.20 --> 9335.58]  So I haven't been able to play video games
[9335.58 --> 9336.76]  I'm getting really antsy
[9336.76 --> 9338.40]  So I wanted something to do
[9338.40 --> 9339.08]  And that
[9339.08 --> 9340.02]  That old game
[9340.02 --> 9341.04]  I don't even remember the name of it right now
[9341.04 --> 9342.32]  But the game that I was playing
[9342.32 --> 9343.60]  To go out for walks for a while there
[9343.60 --> 9343.94]  Yeah
[9343.94 --> 9344.98]  I like leveled out
[9344.98 --> 9346.36]  I got to the point where it's better
[9346.36 --> 9347.18]  To just sit at home
[9347.18 --> 9347.72]  And I'm like
[9347.72 --> 9348.30]  That's stupid
[9348.30 --> 9349.52]  So I stopped playing that game
[9349.52 --> 9351.10]  So I started playing Pokemon Go again
[9351.10 --> 9352.66]  And there's all these actually cool things
[9352.66 --> 9354.34]  What I wanted the other game to do
[9354.34 --> 9355.94]  Pokemon Go has been doing this whole time
[9355.94 --> 9357.22]  And I just kind of forgot it existed
[9357.22 --> 9359.54]  It has like a feature now
[9359.54 --> 9360.28]  Called Routes
[9360.28 --> 9360.96]  Oh yeah
[9360.96 --> 9362.04]  Where there'll be like a trail
[9362.04 --> 9363.64]  And it'll show you how to get to the trail
[9363.64 --> 9365.34]  And if you walk the whole trail
[9365.34 --> 9366.52]  It gives you a bonus at the end
[9366.52 --> 9366.94]  That's cool
[9366.94 --> 9367.60]  It's great
[9367.60 --> 9368.98]  It's cool
[9368.98 --> 9370.14]  Oh, floatplane chat
[9370.14 --> 9371.22]  GM is daltz
[9371.22 --> 9372.82]  It was called
[9372.82 --> 9373.74]  Daltz
[9373.74 --> 9376.86]  It was called Orna
[9376.86 --> 9377.14]  Yeah
[9377.14 --> 9378.02]  So Orna was cool
[9378.02 --> 9379.62]  Until you leveled too far
[9379.62 --> 9380.16]  And then it sucked
[9380.16 --> 9382.48]  But hopefully they fixed it
[9382.48 --> 9382.80]  I don't know
[9382.80 --> 9383.50]  I haven't played in forever
[9383.50 --> 9384.92]  Hey, how's Final Fantasy VI going?
[9385.42 --> 9386.26]  I haven't played more
[9386.26 --> 9387.50]  Terrible
[9387.50 --> 9389.00]  All my developers were here and stuff
[9389.00 --> 9389.66]  I didn't have any time
[9389.66 --> 9390.58]  So you haven't even finished
[9390.58 --> 9391.30]  I'm going to play this weekend probably
[9391.30 --> 9391.98]  You haven't even finished the
[9391.98 --> 9393.06]  Unless I spend the whole time
[9393.06 --> 9393.96]  Hanging out with tank pots
[9393.96 --> 9394.98]  The fight in the
[9394.98 --> 9396.62]  In the snow
[9396.62 --> 9398.34]  No, I'm still
[9398.34 --> 9399.22]  I'm still pending
[9399.22 --> 9400.12]  Alright, okay
[9400.12 --> 9400.58]  Alright
[9400.58 --> 9401.98]  Well, hopefully you remember how to play
[9401.98 --> 9402.54]  Yeah
[9402.54 --> 9403.12]  I mean
[9403.12 --> 9404.00]  I think you'll be alright
[9404.00 --> 9404.34]  Yeah
[9404.34 --> 9407.40]  Police warned about name dropping
[9407.40 --> 9409.86]  Apple's feature name drop
[9409.86 --> 9410.58]  Apparently
[9410.58 --> 9412.24]  Both users must agree
[9412.24 --> 9413.36]  For any information to
[9413.36 --> 9415.02]  For any information transfer
[9415.02 --> 9415.74]  To take place
[9415.74 --> 9416.64]  Between the phones
[9416.64 --> 9419.08]  But the phone
[9419.08 --> 9420.22]  If it is
[9420.22 --> 9421.42]  Within an inch or two of another
[9421.42 --> 9422.70]  And both phones are unlocked
[9422.70 --> 9423.86]  Something
[9423.86 --> 9424.32]  Something
[9424.32 --> 9426.58]  Potential threat to children
[9426.58 --> 9427.14]  They may not
[9427.14 --> 9427.92]  Okay, I don't really
[9427.92 --> 9429.00]  I don't really understand
[9429.00 --> 9430.08]  Exactly what the problem is
[9430.08 --> 9430.42]  With this
[9430.42 --> 9430.96]  Seems fine
[9430.96 --> 9431.98]  Okay, cool
[9431.98 --> 9435.64]  EA patents self-insert character voices
[9435.64 --> 9436.26]  What?
[9436.76 --> 9437.54]  Why would you want to do that?
[9437.58 --> 9438.00]  Well, this is
[9438.00 --> 9439.36]  This is the ethical version
[9439.36 --> 9440.86]  Of AI voices in your games
[9440.86 --> 9442.64]  You record your own voice
[9442.64 --> 9445.60]  And then it trains a model
[9445.60 --> 9446.56]  Interesting
[9446.56 --> 9448.16]  Based on the filing
[9448.16 --> 9449.22]  The system would likely
[9449.22 --> 9450.70]  Use a sample of the player's speech
[9450.70 --> 9452.00]  In order to recreate it
[9452.00 --> 9452.68]  During dialogue
[9452.68 --> 9453.78]  And perhaps allow them
[9453.78 --> 9454.54]  To speak directly
[9454.54 --> 9455.50]  To the game's characters
[9455.50 --> 9456.84]  Depending on the nature of the game
[9456.84 --> 9458.92]  EA appears to be
[9458.92 --> 9459.62]  Attending to patent
[9459.62 --> 9460.90]  The technical aspects
[9460.90 --> 9461.56]  Of the system
[9461.56 --> 9462.94]  Rather than the concept
[9462.94 --> 9463.94]  In and of itself
[9463.94 --> 9465.00]  Hmm
[9465.00 --> 9466.30]  That's kind of cute actually
[9466.30 --> 9467.48]  That's an interesting idea
[9467.48 --> 9468.92]  Being able to talk
[9468.92 --> 9470.84]  Directly is a very interesting idea
[9470.84 --> 9471.78]  That feels like
[9471.78 --> 9472.90]  A future step of gaming
[9472.90 --> 9474.34]  100%
[9474.34 --> 9475.10]  I don't think we're
[9475.10 --> 9475.72]  There yet
[9475.72 --> 9476.18]  To the point where
[9476.18 --> 9476.96]  It would actually be good
[9476.96 --> 9478.14]  But I feel like
[9478.14 --> 9479.18]  That'll be a thing for sure
[9479.18 --> 9482.56]  Have we talked about
[9482.56 --> 9483.24]  Callios?
[9483.42 --> 9483.92]  Someone in
[9483.92 --> 9484.78]  Flowplane chat
[9484.78 --> 9485.90]  Said police blew it up
[9485.90 --> 9486.86]  And then people pointed out
[9486.86 --> 9487.50]  That they were missing
[9487.50 --> 9488.16]  Half the facts
[9488.16 --> 9490.14]  That's a yikes
[9490.14 --> 9491.40]  So yeah
[9491.40 --> 9493.54]  You lightly mentioned it
[9493.54 --> 9495.86]  I think two shows ago
[9495.86 --> 9496.36]  Okay
[9496.36 --> 9497.38]  Okay
[9497.38 --> 9497.94]  So in response
[9497.94 --> 9499.32]  To our original call out
[9499.32 --> 9501.68]  To our
[9501.68 --> 9502.78]  To confirm the rumors
[9502.78 --> 9503.34]  That Callios
[9503.34 --> 9504.34]  Was going to finally
[9504.34 --> 9505.34]  Offer a full refund
[9505.34 --> 9506.02]  To its original
[9506.02 --> 9507.14]  Crowdfunding backers
[9507.14 --> 9508.26]  For that passive case
[9508.26 --> 9509.46]  A community member
[9509.46 --> 9510.92]  Sent us a September 19th
[9510.92 --> 9511.84]  Post from Callios
[9511.84 --> 9512.64]  To backers
[9512.64 --> 9513.78]  In the post
[9513.78 --> 9515.12]  Callios acknowledges
[9515.12 --> 9515.68]  That the product
[9515.68 --> 9516.98]  That resulted from the campaign
[9516.98 --> 9518.82]  That though it exceeded
[9518.82 --> 9519.34]  Its promises
[9519.34 --> 9520.36]  Did so late
[9520.36 --> 9521.44]  And at a significantly
[9521.44 --> 9522.20]  Higher price point
[9522.20 --> 9522.66]  They exceeded
[9522.66 --> 9523.40]  That the product
[9523.40 --> 9525.20]  They eventually built
[9525.20 --> 9527.68]  It's really good you guys
[9527.68 --> 9528.78]  But it's late
[9528.78 --> 9529.54]  And at a much higher
[9529.54 --> 9530.18]  Price point
[9530.18 --> 9532.50]  Even if that price point
[9532.50 --> 9532.84]  Would have been
[9532.84 --> 9533.80]  A more realistic target
[9533.80 --> 9534.48]  For low volume
[9534.48 --> 9535.04]  Premium products
[9535.04 --> 9535.44]  That's something
[9535.44 --> 9535.90]  Something something
[9535.90 --> 9536.14]  Anyway
[9536.14 --> 9536.80]  The point is
[9536.80 --> 9537.62]  It's late
[9537.62 --> 9538.70]  And it's way more expensive
[9538.70 --> 9539.50]  But it is better
[9539.50 --> 9540.44]  That's what they're saying
[9540.44 --> 9542.48]  Sorry about that
[9542.48 --> 9544.28]  And any backers
[9544.28 --> 9545.60]  Who backed the original
[9545.60 --> 9547.16]  Worst cheaper version
[9547.16 --> 9548.84]  Can get a full refund
[9548.84 --> 9550.88]  Or the option of a voucher
[9550.88 --> 9551.48]  That can be used
[9551.48 --> 9552.88]  To buy one of 500
[9552.88 --> 9554.64]  Of the new one
[9554.64 --> 9556.24]  In a limited copper edition
[9556.24 --> 9558.60]  At a 1200 euro price
[9558.60 --> 9559.96]  So that's kind of sick
[9559.96 --> 9561.24]  If the backer
[9561.24 --> 9562.68]  Does not want to buy
[9562.68 --> 9563.76]  The limited edition one
[9563.76 --> 9564.86]  It will instead
[9564.86 --> 9565.54]  Be made available
[9565.54 --> 9566.56]  For general purchase
[9566.56 --> 9567.28]  And the proceeds
[9567.28 --> 9567.84]  Will be used
[9567.84 --> 9569.28]  To refund backers
[9569.28 --> 9570.58]  So this is a quote
[9570.58 --> 9571.90]  We will ensure
[9571.90 --> 9572.90]  That every backer
[9572.90 --> 9573.98]  Who requested a refund
[9573.98 --> 9574.56]  Gets it
[9574.56 --> 9575.90]  And while the mechanism
[9575.90 --> 9577.00]  Is formally tied
[9577.00 --> 9578.02]  To units being sold
[9578.02 --> 9578.80]  For regulatory
[9578.80 --> 9580.40]  And accounting requirements
[9580.40 --> 9581.68]  The refund will be honored
[9581.68 --> 9582.72]  Regardless of your
[9582.72 --> 9584.32]  Allocated unit being sold
[9584.32 --> 9585.86]  A survey will be sent
[9585.86 --> 9586.30]  To backers
[9586.30 --> 9587.24]  To confirm their choice
[9587.24 --> 9588.80]  Those who do not respond
[9588.80 --> 9589.72]  Will be considered
[9589.72 --> 9591.18]  As a refund request
[9591.18 --> 9592.90]  Quote
[9592.90 --> 9593.94]  Some might argue
[9593.94 --> 9594.72]  That this should have been
[9594.72 --> 9596.28]  The option from day one
[9596.28 --> 9598.18]  But there have been
[9598.18 --> 9599.20]  Many factors at play
[9599.20 --> 9600.26]  And without many
[9600.26 --> 9601.28]  Business compromises
[9601.28 --> 9602.54]  Especially from Streetcom
[9602.54 --> 9603.48]  This was simply
[9603.48 --> 9604.74]  Not a viable option
[9604.74 --> 9606.20]  For us until now
[9606.20 --> 9608.88]  So the discussion
[9608.88 --> 9609.76]  Question here is
[9609.76 --> 9610.50]  Would LTT now
[9610.50 --> 9611.82]  Consider covering Calios
[9611.82 --> 9613.36]  Is this later
[9613.36 --> 9614.22]  Better than never
[9614.22 --> 9615.36]  Yes
[9615.36 --> 9615.94]  I think so
[9615.94 --> 9617.44]  I want to hear
[9617.44 --> 9619.12]  From a backer
[9619.12 --> 9620.56]  Who requested a refund
[9620.56 --> 9621.66]  Who got money
[9621.66 --> 9622.16]  Yeah
[9622.16 --> 9623.08]  And then
[9623.08 --> 9624.16]  You know what
[9624.16 --> 9625.00]  I won't even ask
[9625.00 --> 9625.74]  For a review sample
[9625.74 --> 9626.64]  I'll buy one then
[9626.64 --> 9628.00]  I will buy one
[9628.00 --> 9628.72]  And review it
[9628.72 --> 9629.66]  That's my deal
[9629.66 --> 9631.30]  I'm not
[9631.30 --> 9631.86]  I'm not asking
[9631.86 --> 9632.38]  For any
[9632.38 --> 9633.26]  Any handouts
[9633.26 --> 9633.68]  Or anything
[9633.68 --> 9634.88]  I just
[9634.88 --> 9636.14]  Really love
[9636.14 --> 9637.08]  This kind of technology
[9637.08 --> 9638.38]  I want to cover it
[9638.38 --> 9639.94]  And if they are
[9639.94 --> 9640.36]  Going to
[9640.36 --> 9640.64]  You know
[9640.64 --> 9641.24]  Move forward
[9641.24 --> 9642.04]  In good faith
[9642.04 --> 9642.84]  To make their
[9642.84 --> 9643.48]  Backers whole
[9643.48 --> 9644.52]  Then you know
[9644.52 --> 9645.54]  I think that
[9645.54 --> 9646.56]  The coverage
[9646.56 --> 9648.24]  That I said
[9648.24 --> 9648.78]  That I would
[9648.78 --> 9649.86]  I would give it
[9649.86 --> 9652.00]  When I demanded
[9652.00 --> 9652.80]  That they make
[9652.80 --> 9653.74]  That option available
[9653.74 --> 9655.06]  Well I think
[9655.06 --> 9655.72]  That if they're
[9655.72 --> 9656.52]  Willing to move
[9656.52 --> 9657.26]  Forward in good faith
[9657.26 --> 9657.90]  Then I should
[9657.90 --> 9658.50]  Make sure that
[9658.50 --> 9659.00]  I'm not putting
[9659.00 --> 9659.60]  Any additional
[9659.60 --> 9660.32]  Burden on them
[9660.32 --> 9660.66]  And I think
[9660.66 --> 9660.98]  We should
[9660.98 --> 9661.80]  We should cover it
[9661.80 --> 9663.20]  So I'll
[9663.20 --> 9663.78]  I'll buy
[9663.78 --> 9664.52]  I'll buy one of
[9664.52 --> 9665.16]  Those copper
[9665.16 --> 9666.44]  Limited edition
[9666.44 --> 9667.24]  Ones or whatever
[9667.24 --> 9668.96]  As long as
[9668.96 --> 9669.98]  I actually hear
[9669.98 --> 9670.46]  From someone
[9670.46 --> 9671.18]  With proof
[9671.18 --> 9672.66]  That they got
[9672.66 --> 9673.30]  A refund
[9673.30 --> 9673.96]  If assuming
[9673.96 --> 9674.50]  They want one
[9674.50 --> 9674.90]  So guys
[9674.90 --> 9675.92]  You'll have to
[9675.92 --> 9676.96]  Maybe get in touch
[9676.96 --> 9677.48]  With us the same
[9677.48 --> 9678.42]  Way as last time
[9678.42 --> 9679.66]  How did we do that
[9679.66 --> 9681.00]  I don't remember
[9681.00 --> 9682.78]  But LinusTechTips.com
[9682.78 --> 9683.86]  Or LinusTechTips.com
[9683.86 --> 9684.58]  LinusTechTips at
[9684.58 --> 9685.24]  Gmail.com
[9685.24 --> 9685.72]  I think is our
[9685.72 --> 9686.56]  Public inbox still
[9686.56 --> 9688.10]  The previous person
[9688.10 --> 9688.64]  That got in touch
[9688.64 --> 9689.22]  With us was
[9689.22 --> 9689.76]  Through the forum
[9689.76 --> 9691.00]  Oh
[9691.00 --> 9691.56]  How'd they
[9691.56 --> 9692.24]  Who'd they contact
[9692.24 --> 9692.84]  I don't even know
[9692.84 --> 9693.84]  I don't actually
[9693.84 --> 9694.54]  Remember how it worked
[9694.54 --> 9695.14]  I helped it
[9695.14 --> 9695.62]  Go with the
[9695.62 --> 9696.54]  Public facing inbox
[9696.54 --> 9697.24]  The one that's on
[9697.24 --> 9698.74]  The main LTT channel
[9698.74 --> 9699.40]  Yeah
[9699.40 --> 9701.10]  Have you heard about this?
[9701.30 --> 9701.92]  Do you know about this?
[9702.02 --> 9702.54]  This next one?
[9702.98 --> 9703.44]  Oh I was
[9703.44 --> 9704.10]  I went to the
[9704.10 --> 9704.72]  Discovery one
[9704.72 --> 9706.00]  Discovery one
[9706.00 --> 9706.60]  Yeah I actually
[9706.60 --> 9707.22]  Don't think this other
[9707.22 --> 9708.20]  One's that interesting
[9708.20 --> 9708.94]  I mean it's like
[9708.94 --> 9710.20]  Cool but it's not
[9710.20 --> 9710.84]  Very practical
[9710.84 --> 9711.66]  It's so wacky
[9711.66 --> 9712.02]  Yeah
[9712.02 --> 9712.56]  Okay fine
[9712.56 --> 9713.24]  Let's talk about it
[9713.24 --> 9713.86]  Let's talk about it
[9713.86 --> 9714.62]  It's interesting
[9714.62 --> 9715.74]  It's not realistic
[9715.74 --> 9716.32]  At all
[9716.32 --> 9717.40]  Input lag
[9717.40 --> 9717.88]  Blah blah blah
[9717.88 --> 9718.28]  Anyways
[9718.28 --> 9720.14]  Running both
[9720.14 --> 9721.04]  Frame generation
[9721.04 --> 9722.56]  And fluid motion frames
[9722.56 --> 9724.20]  At the same time
[9724.20 --> 9725.34]  A South Korean
[9725.34 --> 9726.18]  Tech outlet
[9726.18 --> 9727.40]  Quasarzone
[9727.40 --> 9727.74]  Yeah
[9727.74 --> 9729.36]  Claims that they have
[9729.36 --> 9730.16]  Managed to run
[9730.16 --> 9731.28]  NVIDIA's frame generation
[9731.28 --> 9732.84]  And AMD's fluid motion
[9732.84 --> 9733.66]  Frame technology
[9733.66 --> 9734.46]  Simultaneously
[9734.46 --> 9735.34]  Although
[9735.34 --> 9736.92]  They showed the
[9736.92 --> 9737.64]  Benchmark results
[9737.64 --> 9738.84]  But no footage
[9738.84 --> 9739.82]  And probably
[9739.82 --> 9740.80]  For good reason
[9740.80 --> 9742.70]  This resulted
[9742.70 --> 9743.72]  In an average boost
[9743.72 --> 9744.74]  Of up to three times
[9744.74 --> 9745.42]  The frame rate
[9745.42 --> 9746.66]  As gaming at native
[9746.66 --> 9747.22]  Resolution
[9747.22 --> 9748.02]  In 4K
[9748.02 --> 9748.94]  And ultra settings
[9748.94 --> 9749.80]  Quasarzone
[9749.80 --> 9750.40]  Plugged in
[9750.40 --> 9751.90]  An RTX 4090
[9751.90 --> 9754.62]  And an RX 6600
[9754.62 --> 9756.00]  Into the same PC
[9756.00 --> 9757.02]  Installed both
[9757.02 --> 9757.56]  Their drivers
[9757.56 --> 9758.34]  Then hooked up
[9758.34 --> 9759.38]  The primary display
[9759.38 --> 9760.38]  To the 6600
[9760.38 --> 9761.96]  While the 4090
[9761.96 --> 9762.72]  Was set to the
[9762.72 --> 9763.62]  Primary GPU
[9763.62 --> 9764.34]  In Windows
[9764.34 --> 9765.86]  So that the 4090's
[9765.86 --> 9767.54]  Post frame gen output
[9767.54 --> 9768.54]  Passed through
[9768.54 --> 9769.44]  The 6600
[9769.44 --> 9770.90]  While the average
[9770.90 --> 9772.08]  Was good
[9772.08 --> 9773.46]  The 1% lows
[9773.46 --> 9774.92]  Either barely increased
[9774.92 --> 9775.96]  Or even decreased
[9775.96 --> 9776.76]  For most games
[9776.76 --> 9777.96]  It also increased
[9777.96 --> 9779.76]  Artifacting
[9779.76 --> 9781.18]  And input lag
[9781.18 --> 9781.90]  And I suspect
[9781.90 --> 9782.88]  By a rather
[9782.88 --> 9783.96]  Significant amount
[9783.96 --> 9786.26]  Discussion question
[9786.26 --> 9787.62]  This is a terrible idea
[9787.62 --> 9788.92]  Should we do it?
[9789.54 --> 9790.60]  I don't know
[9790.60 --> 9791.28]  I uh
[9791.28 --> 9792.42]  It's
[9792.42 --> 9793.76]  Gotta be rough
[9793.76 --> 9794.46]  This reminds me
[9794.46 --> 9794.88]  Of the time
[9794.88 --> 9795.48]  That we ran
[9795.48 --> 9797.06]  SLI and Crossfire
[9797.06 --> 9797.52]  Oh yeah
[9797.52 --> 9798.62]  In the same computer
[9798.62 --> 9799.52]  At the same time
[9799.52 --> 9799.82]  Oh yeah
[9799.82 --> 9801.14]  That was
[9801.14 --> 9802.54]  So frustrating
[9802.54 --> 9803.22]  Oh yeah
[9803.22 --> 9804.52]  It made me
[9804.52 --> 9805.10]  Angry
[9805.10 --> 9805.86]  For
[9805.86 --> 9808.72]  A not insignificant
[9808.72 --> 9809.60]  Period of time
[9809.60 --> 9810.06]  Like it was
[9810.06 --> 9810.80]  Really awful
[9810.80 --> 9812.06]  It looked cool
[9812.06 --> 9812.60]  Yeah it did
[9812.60 --> 9813.66]  It looked super cool
[9813.66 --> 9814.54]  It looked very cool
[9814.54 --> 9815.16]  And honestly
[9815.16 --> 9816.04]  People didn't even think
[9816.04 --> 9816.66]  It was that interesting
[9816.66 --> 9817.14]  Of a video
[9817.14 --> 9817.72]  Like I
[9817.72 --> 9818.76]  There was a lot of feedback
[9818.76 --> 9819.56]  On that video
[9819.56 --> 9820.58]  And around that time
[9820.58 --> 9821.38]  That we've like
[9821.38 --> 9822.08]  Jumped the shark
[9822.08 --> 9823.14]  And lost touch
[9823.14 --> 9823.58]  And it's like
[9823.58 --> 9824.00]  Well yeah
[9824.00 --> 9825.02]  That's not why we did it
[9825.02 --> 9825.46]  So that you
[9825.46 --> 9826.30]  Because we thought
[9826.30 --> 9826.98]  It was a good idea
[9826.98 --> 9827.40]  We just thought
[9827.40 --> 9827.66]  It was
[9827.66 --> 9828.22]  We just thought
[9828.22 --> 9828.74]  It was kind of wild
[9828.74 --> 9829.04]  Cool
[9829.04 --> 9829.88]  I thought it was cool
[9829.88 --> 9830.76]  But it's
[9830.76 --> 9831.46]  It's tough right
[9831.46 --> 9832.26]  Because it's always
[9832.26 --> 9833.84]  It's always a fine balance
[9833.84 --> 9834.08]  Right
[9834.08 --> 9834.62]  Like if we
[9834.62 --> 9835.28]  If we do nothing
[9835.28 --> 9836.24]  But practical content
[9836.24 --> 9837.08]  About how you can
[9837.08 --> 9838.14]  Build an affordable computer
[9838.14 --> 9839.20]  People will tune out
[9839.20 --> 9839.82]  Because they're bored
[9839.82 --> 9841.00]  And if we do
[9841.00 --> 9841.56]  You know
[9841.56 --> 9842.34]  Out there
[9842.34 --> 9842.94]  Like
[9842.94 --> 9844.94]  Spectacle content
[9844.94 --> 9845.92]  People will tell us
[9845.92 --> 9846.74]  We've lost touch
[9846.74 --> 9847.02]  Right
[9847.02 --> 9847.74]  And it's like
[9847.74 --> 9848.36]  Okay well
[9848.36 --> 9849.80]  Some of this
[9849.80 --> 9850.30]  Some of that
[9850.30 --> 9851.04]  Some of something
[9851.04 --> 9851.54]  In between
[9851.54 --> 9852.16]  Just keep
[9852.16 --> 9853.34]  Throwing spaghetti
[9853.34 --> 9853.98]  At the wall
[9853.98 --> 9854.84]  Come on
[9854.84 --> 9855.98]  We'll all eat your spaghet
[9855.98 --> 9857.54]  Just eat it
[9857.54 --> 9860.72]  Discovery content
[9860.72 --> 9860.74]  Discovery content
[9860.74 --> 9861.42]  Has been removed
[9861.42 --> 9863.22]  From PS users libraries
[9863.22 --> 9863.78]  That's right
[9863.78 --> 9864.44]  PlayStation
[9864.44 --> 9866.42]  Sony posted
[9866.42 --> 9868.02]  A legal notice
[9868.02 --> 9868.76]  Stating that
[9868.76 --> 9869.18]  The content
[9869.18 --> 9869.76]  Made by the
[9869.76 --> 9870.42]  Discovery channel
[9870.42 --> 9870.82]  That users
[9870.82 --> 9871.74]  Purchased
[9871.74 --> 9873.14]  Through them
[9873.14 --> 9874.20]  Would no longer
[9874.20 --> 9875.24]  Be available to view
[9875.24 --> 9876.08]  After the end
[9876.08 --> 9876.68]  Of this year
[9876.68 --> 9877.66]  This content
[9877.66 --> 9878.14]  Will not just
[9878.14 --> 9878.58]  Be removed
[9878.58 --> 9879.28]  From the service
[9879.28 --> 9880.64]  It will be removed
[9880.64 --> 9881.50]  From paying
[9881.50 --> 9882.26]  Customers
[9882.26 --> 9883.42]  Libraries
[9883.42 --> 9885.22]  This is apparently
[9885.22 --> 9887.16]  Wow
[9887.16 --> 9888.98]  A licensing issue
[9888.98 --> 9889.60]  Related to
[9889.60 --> 9890.22]  Discovery's
[9890.22 --> 9891.04]  Recent merger
[9891.04 --> 9892.44]  With Warner Brothers
[9892.44 --> 9893.54]  And our discussion
[9893.54 --> 9894.42]  Question here is
[9894.42 --> 9895.86]  Do we own
[9895.86 --> 9896.78]  Anything we buy
[9896.78 --> 9897.20]  Online
[9897.20 --> 9898.00]  And the answer
[9898.00 --> 9898.80]  Is no
[9898.80 --> 9899.60]  No
[9899.60 --> 9900.36]  Have
[9900.36 --> 9902.18]  Offline copies
[9902.18 --> 9903.42]  Or you have
[9903.42 --> 9903.76]  Nothing
[9903.76 --> 9905.96]  And have
[9905.96 --> 9907.02]  This message
[9907.02 --> 9907.72]  From dbrand
[9907.72 --> 9908.82]  Or you have
[9908.82 --> 9909.54]  No wanshow
[9909.54 --> 9910.24]  After dark
[9910.24 --> 9911.66]  That's right
[9911.66 --> 9912.50]  We've got a
[9912.50 --> 9913.42]  Sponsor for wanshow
[9913.42 --> 9913.96]  After dark
[9913.96 --> 9914.70]  Which dan is
[9914.70 --> 9915.64]  Working on
[9915.64 --> 9915.82]  Oh
[9915.82 --> 9916.22]  Oh
[9916.22 --> 9916.62]  Oh
[9916.62 --> 9917.76]  Oh that's cute
[9917.76 --> 9918.44]  Hey
[9918.44 --> 9919.48]  It has a whole
[9919.48 --> 9920.62]  Dbrand skin
[9920.62 --> 9921.12]  On the
[9921.12 --> 9921.72]  On the lower
[9921.72 --> 9922.16]  Banner
[9922.16 --> 9922.70]  Yeah
[9922.70 --> 9924.76]  Uh
[9924.76 --> 9925.72]  Oh wow
[9925.72 --> 9926.90]  Look at that
[9926.90 --> 9928.78]  Of course
[9928.78 --> 9929.68]  It's the new
[9929.68 --> 9930.86]  X-ray skins
[9930.86 --> 9931.14]  That they
[9931.14 --> 9933.54]  You eat them
[9933.54 --> 9935.10]  Okay
[9935.10 --> 9935.98]  That was worth
[9935.98 --> 9936.36]  The work
[9936.36 --> 9936.76]  That we put
[9936.76 --> 9937.10]  Into it
[9937.10 --> 9937.40]  I'm sure
[9937.40 --> 9938.30]  Um
[9938.30 --> 9939.90]  Uh
[9939.90 --> 9940.32]  They launched
[9940.32 --> 9941.30]  These as part
[9941.30 --> 9941.76]  Of the
[9941.76 --> 9942.78]  Minus subsists
[9942.78 --> 9943.32]  Entirely
[9943.32 --> 9944.00]  Neat x-ray purchases
[9944.00 --> 9945.26]  I do not
[9945.26 --> 9945.88]  Zach from
[9945.88 --> 9946.68]  Jerrybring everything
[9946.68 --> 9947.52]  And you guys
[9947.52 --> 9947.96]  Are gonna make
[9947.96 --> 9948.66]  Money on these
[9948.66 --> 9949.18]  I mean I guess
[9949.18 --> 9949.64]  You gave some
[9949.64 --> 9950.06]  Of it to me
[9950.06 --> 9950.56]  Obviously
[9950.56 --> 9951.60]  Buy x-ray
[9951.60 --> 9952.20]  Or we stop
[9952.20 --> 9952.84]  Paying for this
[9952.84 --> 9953.22]  Spot
[9953.22 --> 9958.76]  It's very honest
[9958.76 --> 9963.02]  You got
[9963.02 --> 9963.82]  You gotta give them
[9963.82 --> 9964.30]  Credit for the
[9964.30 --> 9964.94]  Honesty man
[9964.94 --> 9965.34]  Yeah
[9965.34 --> 9966.04]  That's legit
[9966.04 --> 9966.68]  Um
[9966.68 --> 9967.92]  So I guess
[9967.92 --> 9968.62]  I'm now
[9968.62 --> 9969.26]  I'm now
[9969.26 --> 9970.36]  Obligated by my
[9970.36 --> 9971.16]  Responsibility
[9971.16 --> 9972.34]  To our shareholders
[9972.34 --> 9973.42]  To tell you
[9973.42 --> 9973.98]  That you need
[9973.98 --> 9974.76]  To buy x-ray
[9974.76 --> 9975.28]  Yeah
[9975.28 --> 9975.98]  Or else
[9975.98 --> 9976.98]  We will not
[9976.98 --> 9977.46]  Make money
[9977.46 --> 9977.98]  Wow
[9977.98 --> 9979.28]  Buy the real one
[9979.28 --> 9979.78]  Yeah
[9979.78 --> 9980.34]  Anyway
[9980.34 --> 9981.30]  Uh
[9981.30 --> 9982.36]  That's great
[9982.36 --> 9983.52]  So x-ray
[9983.52 --> 9984.10]  Is the line
[9984.10 --> 9984.44]  Of skins
[9984.44 --> 9985.22]  That they launched
[9985.22 --> 9986.20]  To showcase
[9986.20 --> 9987.26]  What innovation
[9987.26 --> 9989.04]  Actually looks like
[9989.04 --> 9991.84]  Uh
[9991.84 --> 9992.72]  What was it
[9992.72 --> 9993.42]  Originality
[9993.42 --> 9994.66]  Or what originality
[9994.66 --> 9995.54]  Actually looks like
[9995.54 --> 9996.14]  That's the word
[9996.14 --> 9996.62]  That case
[9996.62 --> 9997.16]  If I used
[9997.16 --> 9997.88]  Alright
[9997.88 --> 9998.88]  I guess it's
[9998.88 --> 9999.62]  Merch message time
[9999.62 --> 9999.86]  Then
[9999.86 --> 10001.50]  I guess so
[10001.50 --> 10003.26]  I'm not saying
[10003.26 --> 10003.86]  I guess we'll
[10003.86 --> 10004.80]  Actually talk about
[10004.80 --> 10005.08]  Merch
[10005.08 --> 10005.76]  Hold on
[10005.76 --> 10006.34]  Flowplane chat
[10006.34 --> 10007.06]  The skins are not
[10007.06 --> 10007.42]  Edible
[10007.42 --> 10009.28]  Calm down
[10009.28 --> 10009.64]  You guys
[10009.64 --> 10011.08]  Don't
[10011.08 --> 10011.98]  Should we
[10011.98 --> 10012.80]  Should we check
[10012.80 --> 10013.32]  With dbrand
[10013.32 --> 10013.82]  If they want
[10013.82 --> 10014.20]  To just do
[10014.20 --> 10014.80]  I don't know
[10014.80 --> 10015.68]  How many we would sell
[10015.68 --> 10016.24]  Like maybe even
[10016.24 --> 10017.00]  Just a few hundred
[10017.00 --> 10017.48]  Maybe we could
[10017.48 --> 10018.20]  Just do like
[10018.20 --> 10020.24]  I don't know
[10020.24 --> 10021.06]  The latest iPhone
[10021.06 --> 10021.88]  And the latest
[10021.88 --> 10022.82]  Like s whatever
[10022.82 --> 10023.68]  From samsung
[10023.68 --> 10024.20]  But just like
[10024.20 --> 10025.00]  A float plane logo
[10025.00 --> 10025.64]  Skin or something
[10025.64 --> 10026.08]  Like that
[10026.08 --> 10026.76]  You know
[10026.76 --> 10027.32]  Maybe not even
[10027.32 --> 10027.62]  A skin
[10027.62 --> 10028.12]  Maybe just
[10028.12 --> 10028.86]  I love how you
[10028.86 --> 10029.20]  Would do
[10029.20 --> 10029.98]  The float plane
[10029.98 --> 10030.52]  Logo skin
[10030.52 --> 10031.02]  In a phone
[10031.02 --> 10031.56]  That I don't
[10031.56 --> 10031.92]  Have
[10031.92 --> 10033.40]  Actually a pixel
[10033.40 --> 10033.76]  Okay
[10033.76 --> 10034.24]  No no no
[10034.24 --> 10034.44]  Okay
[10034.44 --> 10034.78]  So we do
[10034.78 --> 10035.64]  Okay
[10035.64 --> 10036.08]  Okay
[10036.08 --> 10036.44]  Look
[10036.44 --> 10037.80]  Look I'm trying
[10037.80 --> 10038.26]  To make everyone
[10038.26 --> 10038.72]  Happy here
[10038.72 --> 10038.88]  Okay
[10038.88 --> 10039.28]  You know what
[10039.28 --> 10039.70]  Forget it
[10039.70 --> 10040.02]  It's probably
[10040.02 --> 10040.32]  Going to be
[10040.32 --> 10040.86]  Too much work
[10040.86 --> 10041.34]  For those guys
[10041.34 --> 10041.60]  Anyway
[10041.60 --> 10042.86]  To support it
[10042.86 --> 10043.44]  Because we probably
[10043.44 --> 10044.02]  Wouldn't sell more
[10044.02 --> 10044.92]  Than like a couple hundred
[10044.92 --> 10045.48]  I'm assuming
[10045.48 --> 10046.70]  They need pretty crazy
[10046.70 --> 10047.74]  Quantities for their
[10047.74 --> 10048.62]  Types of runs
[10048.62 --> 10050.40]  It's surprising
[10050.40 --> 10051.58]  How much development
[10051.58 --> 10052.06]  It takes
[10052.06 --> 10052.86]  To make a sticker
[10052.86 --> 10054.50]  And the funny thing
[10054.50 --> 10054.90]  Is like
[10054.90 --> 10055.48]  We know
[10055.48 --> 10056.54]  I was reading
[10056.54 --> 10057.32]  The blog post
[10057.32 --> 10058.72]  About the
[10058.72 --> 10059.28]  Series
[10059.28 --> 10060.88]  X
[10060.88 --> 10061.62]  White
[10061.62 --> 10062.64]  Edition
[10062.64 --> 10064.40]  Where Microsoft
[10064.40 --> 10065.26]  Kind of wrote up
[10065.26 --> 10066.04]  This thing about
[10066.04 --> 10067.10]  How changing the
[10067.10 --> 10067.62]  Color was
[10067.62 --> 10069.24]  Super non-trivial
[10069.24 --> 10069.86]  Because
[10069.86 --> 10070.82]  There
[10070.82 --> 10072.02]  And this is all
[10072.02 --> 10072.76]  Stuff that we know
[10072.76 --> 10073.14]  From
[10073.14 --> 10074.24]  Remember how it took
[10074.24 --> 10075.14]  So long for us
[10075.14 --> 10075.86]  To launch new color
[10075.86 --> 10076.50]  Bread skin
[10076.50 --> 10077.44]  Oh my god
[10077.44 --> 10078.00]  That would actually
[10078.00 --> 10078.42]  Probably
[10078.42 --> 10079.10]  No
[10079.10 --> 10079.88]  That would be
[10079.88 --> 10081.34]  We'd sell dozens
[10081.34 --> 10081.72]  Anyway
[10081.72 --> 10083.14]  Oh I don't know
[10083.14 --> 10084.16]  Okay back to the
[10084.16 --> 10085.26]  Back to the
[10085.26 --> 10085.44]  Micro
[10085.44 --> 10086.00]  Oh yeah
[10086.00 --> 10086.62]  Back to the
[10086.62 --> 10087.22]  Xbox thing
[10087.22 --> 10089.12]  We learned this
[10089.12 --> 10089.50]  When we were
[10089.50 --> 10090.08]  Changing the color
[10090.08 --> 10090.64]  Of the screwdriver
[10090.64 --> 10091.52]  It's not
[10091.52 --> 10092.30]  Simple
[10092.30 --> 10092.84]  They went and
[10092.84 --> 10093.42]  They shot it
[10093.42 --> 10093.82]  In the different
[10093.82 --> 10094.42]  Color plastic
[10094.42 --> 10094.90]  And realized
[10094.90 --> 10095.24]  They had all
[10095.24 --> 10096.04]  These swirls
[10096.04 --> 10096.88]  They had these
[10096.88 --> 10097.58]  Marks
[10097.58 --> 10098.38]  That were not
[10098.38 --> 10099.66]  Visible in black
[10099.66 --> 10100.38]  Where the
[10100.38 --> 10101.60]  Where the plastic
[10101.60 --> 10102.54]  Was flowing
[10102.54 --> 10103.80]  And it was like
[10103.80 --> 10105.14]  The most
[10105.14 --> 10105.98]  Nightmarish
[10105.98 --> 10107.70]  Tiny upgrade
[10107.70 --> 10108.12]  Ever
[10108.12 --> 10108.64]  Yeah
[10108.64 --> 10109.88]  And I think
[10109.88 --> 10110.42]  That's something
[10110.42 --> 10111.24]  That people
[10111.24 --> 10112.14]  Often don't
[10112.14 --> 10112.70]  Appreciate
[10112.70 --> 10113.34]  Whether it's
[10113.34 --> 10113.68]  A sticker
[10113.68 --> 10114.32]  Or whether it's
[10114.32 --> 10114.90]  A different color
[10114.90 --> 10115.48]  Of plastic
[10115.48 --> 10116.38]  Or whether it's
[10116.38 --> 10117.64]  Whether it's
[10117.64 --> 10120.68]  A sound
[10120.68 --> 10123.04]  Making a product
[10123.04 --> 10123.74]  Is easy
[10123.74 --> 10124.80]  Making a product
[10124.80 --> 10125.26]  At scale
[10125.26 --> 10125.84]  Is hard
[10125.84 --> 10126.96]  Making a good
[10126.96 --> 10127.94]  Product at scale
[10127.94 --> 10128.74]  Where you actually
[10128.74 --> 10129.12]  Care
[10129.12 --> 10129.82]  That's really
[10129.82 --> 10130.54]  Really hard
[10130.54 --> 10130.90]  And it kind of
[10130.90 --> 10131.28]  Doesn't matter
[10131.28 --> 10131.82]  What it is
[10131.82 --> 10133.40]  If you care enough
[10133.40 --> 10134.08]  You'll find a way
[10134.08 --> 10134.94]  To make it hard
[10134.94 --> 10137.40]  Because if it was easy
[10137.40 --> 10138.26]  Somebody else
[10138.26 --> 10139.42]  Would already be doing it
[10139.42 --> 10140.78]  Which is what
[10140.78 --> 10141.48]  I always tell my kids
[10141.48 --> 10141.72]  Anyway
[10141.72 --> 10142.02]  Dan
[10142.02 --> 10142.80]  Hit me
[10142.80 --> 10143.62]  Sure sure sure
[10143.62 --> 10145.34]  Let's have a look
[10145.34 --> 10145.60]  Here
[10145.60 --> 10146.70]  LLD
[10146.70 --> 10147.54]  Any updates
[10147.54 --> 10148.36]  On the upcoming
[10148.36 --> 10149.86]  Laptop messenger bag
[10149.86 --> 10150.62]  Now that I'm starting
[10150.62 --> 10151.42]  To game on my
[10151.42 --> 10151.92]  Lunch breaks
[10151.92 --> 10152.62]  I'd like something
[10152.62 --> 10153.18]  Not as big
[10153.18 --> 10154.30]  As the legendary
[10154.30 --> 10155.18]  LTT backpack
[10155.18 --> 10158.32]  I'm checking
[10158.32 --> 10159.54]  I have my
[10159.54 --> 10160.64]  My update
[10160.64 --> 10162.08]  Email
[10162.08 --> 10163.36]  From Nick
[10163.36 --> 10164.58]  I don't see anything
[10164.58 --> 10165.40]  About it in there
[10165.40 --> 10165.80]  But I
[10165.80 --> 10166.38]  I think
[10166.38 --> 10166.70]  We're
[10166.70 --> 10167.48]  I think
[10167.48 --> 10167.74]  It's
[10167.74 --> 10168.66]  I think development
[10168.66 --> 10169.30]  Is done
[10169.30 --> 10170.34]  And we're just
[10170.34 --> 10170.92]  Waiting on
[10170.92 --> 10171.88]  Finalizing our
[10171.88 --> 10172.46]  Initial order
[10172.46 --> 10173.14]  Quantities
[10173.14 --> 10174.02]  It's
[10174.02 --> 10174.64]  Going to be
[10174.64 --> 10175.08]  Awesome
[10175.08 --> 10175.66]  Honestly
[10175.66 --> 10176.82]  I got to tell you
[10176.82 --> 10177.28]  I know
[10177.28 --> 10178.22]  What my rules are
[10178.22 --> 10178.86]  But I'm tempted
[10178.86 --> 10179.60]  To just offer it
[10179.60 --> 10180.18]  As a pre-sale
[10180.18 --> 10180.96]  Because
[10180.96 --> 10182.26]  I know it's
[10182.26 --> 10182.76]  Really good
[10182.76 --> 10183.82]  It's based on
[10183.82 --> 10184.56]  The same DNA
[10184.56 --> 10185.30]  As the backpack
[10185.30 --> 10188.78]  And it would
[10188.78 --> 10189.66]  Help us a lot
[10189.66 --> 10190.24]  In terms of
[10190.24 --> 10190.70]  Figuring out
[10190.70 --> 10191.14]  What our order
[10191.14 --> 10192.02]  Quantities should be
[10192.02 --> 10192.80]  Yeah
[10192.80 --> 10193.96]  W Calderini
[10193.96 --> 10194.62]  Says it's
[10194.62 --> 10195.28]  Money from me
[10195.28 --> 10196.14]  Yeah I know
[10196.14 --> 10197.00]  I know a lot
[10197.00 --> 10197.44]  Of people are
[10197.44 --> 10197.94]  Waiting for it
[10197.94 --> 10198.30]  But I don't
[10198.30 --> 10198.94]  Know if a lot
[10198.94 --> 10199.56]  Is a thousand
[10199.56 --> 10200.44]  Or ten thousand
[10200.44 --> 10201.26]  Or a hundred thousand
[10201.26 --> 10202.14]  I have no idea
[10202.14 --> 10202.72]  You should do
[10202.72 --> 10203.82]  You should like
[10203.82 --> 10206.56]  What justifies it
[10206.56 --> 10206.98]  A review
[10206.98 --> 10209.32]  Justifies it
[10209.32 --> 10209.86]  What just
[10209.86 --> 10210.30]  Like
[10210.30 --> 10211.38]  What makes it
[10211.38 --> 10211.78]  Okay
[10211.78 --> 10213.12]  Well the line
[10213.12 --> 10213.84]  We drew in the sand
[10213.84 --> 10214.32]  Before
[10214.32 --> 10215.24]  Was
[10215.24 --> 10217.04]  It's not a pre-order
[10217.04 --> 10218.24]  It's a backorder
[10218.24 --> 10218.76]  Because
[10218.76 --> 10220.12]  It had been
[10220.12 --> 10220.74]  Available
[10220.74 --> 10222.50]  To real
[10222.50 --> 10223.34]  Individual
[10223.34 --> 10224.36]  Retail customers
[10224.36 --> 10225.92]  Who were given
[10225.92 --> 10227.08]  An opportunity
[10227.08 --> 10228.12]  To use it
[10228.12 --> 10228.80]  And review it
[10228.80 --> 10229.82]  Would the timeline
[10229.82 --> 10230.50]  Line up with one
[10230.50 --> 10231.04]  Of the lands
[10231.04 --> 10232.84]  No probably not
[10232.84 --> 10233.40]  Oh damn
[10233.40 --> 10233.98]  Yeah like if we
[10233.98 --> 10234.84]  Just go mass production
[10234.84 --> 10235.96]  Then well
[10235.96 --> 10237.08]  We have to commit now
[10237.08 --> 10237.56]  Like we have to
[10237.56 --> 10238.26]  Decide right now
[10238.26 --> 10238.76]  Essentially
[10238.76 --> 10240.44]  So in order for us
[10240.44 --> 10242.56]  To do any kind of
[10242.56 --> 10243.80]  Um
[10243.80 --> 10244.48]  No we didn't
[10244.48 --> 10245.28]  Pre-sell the screwdriver
[10245.28 --> 10246.60]  We backordered
[10246.60 --> 10247.18]  The screwdriver
[10247.18 --> 10248.50]  We sold some
[10248.50 --> 10249.12]  Screwdrivers
[10249.12 --> 10249.88]  And then it was
[10249.88 --> 10250.34]  A while before
[10250.34 --> 10250.70]  We were going to
[10250.70 --> 10251.12]  Have stock
[10251.12 --> 10251.42]  And we took
[10251.42 --> 10251.90]  Backorders
[10251.90 --> 10252.36]  Quite a few
[10252.36 --> 10252.84]  Screwdrivers
[10252.84 --> 10253.76]  Yeah we sold
[10253.76 --> 10254.16]  A lot of
[10254.16 --> 10254.62]  Screwdrivers
[10254.62 --> 10255.62]  Um
[10255.62 --> 10256.38]  And like
[10256.38 --> 10257.28]  It seems fair
[10257.28 --> 10257.78]  Do that again
[10257.78 --> 10258.32]  Yeah it's
[10258.32 --> 10259.46]  Really hard
[10259.46 --> 10260.08]  It is
[10260.08 --> 10260.78]  It adds a ton
[10260.78 --> 10261.22]  Of overhead
[10261.22 --> 10261.64]  If it's not
[10261.64 --> 10262.06]  Something where
[10262.06 --> 10262.42]  We're sure
[10262.42 --> 10262.78]  We're going to
[10262.78 --> 10263.42]  Sell tens of
[10263.42 --> 10263.68]  Thousands
[10263.68 --> 10264.10]  Of units
[10264.10 --> 10264.72]  It just doesn't
[10264.72 --> 10265.28]  Make any sense
[10265.28 --> 10265.74]  We might as well
[10265.74 --> 10266.20]  Just order
[10266.20 --> 10266.86]  Fewer of them
[10266.86 --> 10267.40]  And if it sells
[10267.40 --> 10267.54]  Out
[10267.54 --> 10268.00]  It sells out
[10268.00 --> 10268.20]  And we'll
[10268.20 --> 10268.64]  Order some more
[10268.64 --> 10269.52]  Um
[10269.52 --> 10270.22]  So it's
[10270.22 --> 10270.68]  It's tough
[10270.68 --> 10271.12]  People are saying
[10271.12 --> 10271.62]  No pre-order
[10271.62 --> 10272.06]  And it's like
[10272.06 --> 10272.68]  Yeah I know
[10272.68 --> 10273.52]  But you also
[10273.52 --> 10273.94]  Don't have to
[10273.94 --> 10274.36]  Order it
[10274.36 --> 10275.62]  We do have
[10275.62 --> 10276.16]  The trust me
[10276.16 --> 10276.34]  Grow
[10276.34 --> 10277.08]  The trust me
[10277.08 --> 10277.32]  Grow
[10277.32 --> 10279.38]  The trust me
[10279.38 --> 10279.86]  Bro guarantee
[10279.86 --> 10280.58]  Would it make you
[10280.58 --> 10281.02]  Feel better
[10281.02 --> 10283.64]  If there was like
[10283.64 --> 10284.28]  A little banner
[10284.28 --> 10285.16]  Being like
[10285.16 --> 10286.40]  Don't pre-order
[10286.40 --> 10287.14]  No one has been
[10287.14 --> 10287.70]  Able to
[10287.70 --> 10288.62]  Order this yet
[10288.62 --> 10289.48]  No one has been
[10289.48 --> 10289.86]  Able to
[10289.86 --> 10291.04]  Review this yet
[10291.04 --> 10292.42]  We always
[10292.42 --> 10293.28]  Recommend
[10293.28 --> 10294.76]  Against pre-ordering
[10294.76 --> 10295.76]  Yeah but like
[10295.76 --> 10296.70]  You can if you
[10296.70 --> 10297.54]  Want I guess
[10297.54 --> 10299.30]  It's like
[10299.30 --> 10300.22]  Super chats
[10300.22 --> 10301.10]  We don't stop
[10301.10 --> 10301.62]  You from doing
[10301.62 --> 10302.16]  Super chats
[10302.16 --> 10302.76]  Yeah it's true
[10302.76 --> 10303.24]  We just tell you
[10303.24 --> 10303.74]  To do merch
[10303.74 --> 10304.44]  Some people are
[10304.44 --> 10305.30]  Super mad about
[10305.30 --> 10305.62]  That
[10305.62 --> 10306.44]  Why
[10306.44 --> 10307.88]  I don't know
[10307.88 --> 10309.04]  Because it's
[10309.04 --> 10310.06]  Hypocritical or
[10310.06 --> 10310.94]  Because it's
[10310.94 --> 10311.68]  Because
[10311.68 --> 10313.02]  I don't know
[10313.02 --> 10313.58]  They find a way
[10313.58 --> 10314.22]  To make it evil
[10314.22 --> 10315.06]  Because I will
[10315.06 --> 10315.74]  Allow people to
[10315.74 --> 10316.20]  Throw money at
[10316.20 --> 10316.72]  The screen even
[10316.72 --> 10317.30]  Though I advise
[10317.30 --> 10317.90]  Them not to
[10317.90 --> 10319.16]  It's like why
[10319.16 --> 10320.46]  It's a free country
[10320.46 --> 10321.98]  Send
[10321.98 --> 10322.66]  Throw money at
[10322.66 --> 10323.06]  The screen if
[10323.06 --> 10323.46]  You want to
[10323.46 --> 10324.22]  I can't stop you
[10324.22 --> 10325.38]  I make it
[10325.38 --> 10325.94]  Really clear
[10325.94 --> 10326.84]  How to interact
[10326.84 --> 10327.28]  With the show
[10327.28 --> 10328.12]  It ain't super chats
[10328.12 --> 10328.68]  Yeah
[10328.68 --> 10330.08]  There's no obligation
[10330.08 --> 10332.44]  To like respond
[10332.44 --> 10333.10]  To or deal
[10333.10 --> 10333.80]  With super chats
[10333.80 --> 10334.60]  Even if that's
[10334.60 --> 10335.10]  The only one
[10335.10 --> 10335.68]  That you have
[10335.68 --> 10338.04]  Yeah I don't know
[10338.04 --> 10338.80]  I'll maybe
[10338.80 --> 10339.46]  Maybe I'll talk
[10339.46 --> 10340.02]  To maybe I'll
[10340.02 --> 10340.40]  Talk to the
[10340.40 --> 10341.12]  Buys about it
[10341.12 --> 10342.84]  The Buys
[10342.84 --> 10344.74]  This is great
[10344.74 --> 10345.74]  The hammock guy
[10345.74 --> 10346.84]  I don't think
[10346.84 --> 10347.40]  You should do it
[10347.40 --> 10348.10]  Because principles
[10348.10 --> 10349.56]  But I'll pre-order
[10349.56 --> 10350.34]  One if you do it
[10350.34 --> 10354.20]  And this is
[10354.20 --> 10354.64]  This is why
[10354.64 --> 10355.56]  Microtransactions
[10355.56 --> 10356.04]  Exist
[10356.04 --> 10356.74]  Yeah

[10371.18 --> 10371.56]  Elijah thing

[10373.82 --> 10374.38]  We were trying
[10374.38 --> 10374.82]  Something
[10374.82 --> 10375.50]  And we were
[10375.50 --> 10376.02]  We were just
[10376.02 --> 10376.66]  Kind of riffing
[10376.66 --> 10377.14]  And we were like

[10391.88 --> 10392.74]  Eastern Canadian
[10392.74 --> 10393.82]  Boys
[10393.82 --> 10395.08]  Oh

[10402.20 --> 10403.24]  Any Canadian
[10403.24 --> 10404.42]  Specific slang
[10404.42 --> 10405.08]  Yeah I know

[10411.36 --> 10411.84]  Four for you
[10411.84 --> 10412.14]  Right here
[10412.14 --> 10412.44]  Linus
[10412.44 --> 10412.88]  Yeah
[10412.88 --> 10414.30]  Hey DLL
[10414.30 --> 10415.12]  Linus what
[10415.12 --> 10415.82]  Aspects of your
[10415.82 --> 10416.64]  Company's culture
[10416.64 --> 10417.26]  Are you most
[10417.26 --> 10418.20]  Proud of developing
[10418.20 --> 10418.98]  Or maintaining
[10418.98 --> 10419.68]  Now that you've
[10419.68 --> 10420.36]  Built Linus Media
[10420.36 --> 10421.04]  Group into a
[10421.04 --> 10421.94]  100 person
[10421.94 --> 10423.00]  Employee company
[10423.00 --> 10424.32]  It's hard for me
[10424.32 --> 10425.34]  To say because
[10425.34 --> 10426.86]  The view
[10426.86 --> 10427.90]  That I get
[10427.90 --> 10428.58]  I'm not proud
[10428.58 --> 10428.94]  Of that
[10428.94 --> 10430.52]  Just happens
[10430.52 --> 10431.06]  Every day
[10431.06 --> 10432.12]  World class
[10432.12 --> 10432.64]  World class
[10432.64 --> 10433.12]  Pee on the
[10433.12 --> 10433.36]  Floor
[10433.36 --> 10434.38]  World class
[10434.38 --> 10435.26]  Maybe in Luke's
[10435.26 --> 10435.82]  Water bottle
[10435.82 --> 10437.54]  Prove it's not
[10437.54 --> 10438.44]  I filled it myself
[10438.44 --> 10438.86]  It gets everywhere
[10438.86 --> 10440.82]  Stop
[10440.82 --> 10441.60]  I mean you get
[10441.60 --> 10442.16]  Yours all over
[10442.16 --> 10442.68]  Yourself
[10442.68 --> 10449.70]  What's happening
[10449.70 --> 10452.44]  Why did I start
[10452.44 --> 10452.76]  This
[10452.76 --> 10455.58]  It's hard for me
[10455.58 --> 10456.48]  To tell because
[10456.48 --> 10458.64]  I never see
[10458.64 --> 10460.04]  The same view
[10460.04 --> 10460.82]  That other people
[10460.82 --> 10461.62]  See and I never
[10461.62 --> 10462.46]  Wanted that to be
[10462.46 --> 10463.18]  True I always
[10463.18 --> 10464.02]  Wanted to be
[10464.02 --> 10465.04]  One of the gang
[10465.04 --> 10466.12]  And just you know
[10466.12 --> 10466.96]  In the thick of it
[10466.96 --> 10468.40]  And I like working
[10468.40 --> 10469.10]  In the trenches
[10469.10 --> 10470.24]  With everybody right
[10470.24 --> 10472.06]  But the reality of it
[10472.06 --> 10473.32]  Is that I see a very
[10473.32 --> 10474.50]  Different side of people
[10474.50 --> 10475.54]  Than they see of each
[10475.54 --> 10476.20]  Other because
[10476.20 --> 10477.14]  Whenever I'm around
[10477.14 --> 10478.50]  The boss is watching
[10478.50 --> 10480.04]  And that's
[10480.04 --> 10481.56]  As much as I don't
[10481.56 --> 10482.34]  Want that to be the
[10482.34 --> 10482.94]  Case that
[10482.94 --> 10484.24]  That is how it is
[10484.24 --> 10485.64]  And I mean
[10485.64 --> 10486.58]  Okay coming back to
[10486.58 --> 10487.52]  I've felt that a lot
[10487.52 --> 10488.74]  Over the last few days
[10488.74 --> 10489.50]  Unfortunately
[10489.50 --> 10491.56]  That I was watching you
[10491.56 --> 10492.26]  No no no
[10492.26 --> 10492.72]  Oh
[10492.72 --> 10494.28]  Like being
[10494.28 --> 10495.00]  Mode and tone
[10495.00 --> 10495.90]  Shifts when I would
[10495.90 --> 10497.12]  Get close
[10497.12 --> 10497.82]  Yeah
[10497.82 --> 10498.44]  Oh okay
[10498.44 --> 10499.44]  Yeah
[10499.44 --> 10499.78]  Alright
[10499.78 --> 10500.90]  And like to be clear
[10500.90 --> 10502.04]  I get like I get it
[10502.04 --> 10503.24]  Going back to the thing
[10503.24 --> 10504.22]  With the backpack earlier
[10504.22 --> 10504.66]  It's like
[10504.66 --> 10505.98]  When I see something wrong
[10505.98 --> 10506.46]  Instantly
[10506.46 --> 10507.54]  It's not even
[10507.54 --> 10508.84]  It's not even a conscious thought
[10508.84 --> 10509.28]  I'm like okay
[10509.28 --> 10510.18]  Investigate and fix
[10510.18 --> 10511.36]  And you know
[10511.36 --> 10512.04]  Sometimes the thing
[10512.04 --> 10512.80]  That's going wrong
[10512.80 --> 10513.98]  Is what someone else
[10513.98 --> 10514.76]  Is doing right
[10514.76 --> 10515.44]  Like it's
[10515.44 --> 10516.16]  And
[10516.16 --> 10518.88]  It doesn't have to be
[10518.88 --> 10519.80]  In like an evil
[10519.80 --> 10520.74]  Or nasty way
[10520.74 --> 10521.28]  Or anything
[10521.28 --> 10521.96]  But it is
[10521.96 --> 10522.56]  It is something
[10522.56 --> 10523.40]  That I
[10523.40 --> 10524.72]  I'm very passionate about
[10524.72 --> 10525.40]  That I obviously
[10525.40 --> 10526.10]  Have a lot
[10526.10 --> 10527.50]  A lot tied up in
[10527.50 --> 10528.36]  I have a lot riding
[10528.36 --> 10529.00]  On the success
[10529.00 --> 10529.56]  Of this company
[10529.56 --> 10530.42]  And you know
[10530.42 --> 10530.88]  I want to
[10530.88 --> 10531.52]  I want to make sure
[10531.52 --> 10532.06]  That it continues
[10532.06 --> 10532.80]  To be successful
[10532.80 --> 10533.70]  For myself
[10533.70 --> 10534.24]  And obviously
[10534.24 --> 10534.92]  For the other people
[10534.92 --> 10535.54]  Who work here
[10535.54 --> 10536.82]  Who as far as I can tell
[10536.82 --> 10538.38]  Still want to work here
[10538.38 --> 10540.04]  And still want it to exist
[10540.04 --> 10540.24]  Right
[10540.24 --> 10540.72]  So it's
[10540.72 --> 10543.82]  It's tough
[10543.82 --> 10545.88]  And so I think
[10545.88 --> 10546.96]  You know
[10546.96 --> 10548.54]  A thing that I'm really proud of
[10548.54 --> 10549.84]  Is that people are
[10549.84 --> 10551.32]  Are able to give
[10551.32 --> 10552.62]  Feedback
[10552.62 --> 10554.10]  Without fear of repercussions
[10554.10 --> 10556.88]  But it's possible
[10556.88 --> 10557.60]  That some people
[10557.60 --> 10558.66]  Do feel fear
[10558.66 --> 10559.26]  And that's something
[10559.26 --> 10560.02]  That I
[10560.02 --> 10561.02]  I want us to
[10561.02 --> 10562.14]  Never lose track
[10562.14 --> 10562.92]  Of continuing
[10562.92 --> 10564.48]  To try to improve
[10564.48 --> 10564.80]  So
[10564.80 --> 10567.06]  Having
[10567.06 --> 10570.76]  Having scheduled times
[10570.76 --> 10571.62]  For people to get feedback
[10571.62 --> 10572.72]  I mean going back to
[10572.72 --> 10573.36]  I think
[10573.36 --> 10574.42]  Was it the first year
[10574.42 --> 10575.34]  Or the second year
[10575.34 --> 10576.22]  That we started doing
[10576.22 --> 10576.92]  Annual reviews
[10576.92 --> 10579.04]  That I gave you guys
[10579.04 --> 10580.12]  The form ahead of time
[10580.12 --> 10581.02]  And asked you to fill them out
[10581.02 --> 10581.72]  For me as well
[10581.72 --> 10582.52]  Should you
[10582.52 --> 10583.26]  Should you desire
[10583.26 --> 10584.88]  It was not the first year
[10584.88 --> 10585.50]  Okay
[10585.50 --> 10586.34]  Because the first year's
[10586.34 --> 10587.48]  Annual reviews were like
[10587.48 --> 10588.08]  Super weird
[10588.08 --> 10588.50]  Yeah
[10588.50 --> 10589.54]  That was really awkward
[10589.54 --> 10590.82]  It was
[10590.82 --> 10591.24]  It was
[10591.24 --> 10593.70]  Probably one of the most
[10593.70 --> 10594.44]  Stark
[10594.44 --> 10596.02]  Turning points
[10596.02 --> 10596.46]  From
[10596.46 --> 10597.84]  Bros in a garage
[10597.84 --> 10598.50]  To
[10598.50 --> 10599.42]  Corporate
[10599.42 --> 10600.76]  That we ever underwent
[10600.76 --> 10601.38]  It was also like
[10601.38 --> 10602.06]  In my room
[10602.06 --> 10602.72]  Yeah
[10602.72 --> 10603.04]  Yeah
[10603.04 --> 10605.56]  In Luke's
[10605.56 --> 10607.80]  Or as corporate as it can be
[10607.80 --> 10608.90]  When it's in Luke's
[10608.90 --> 10609.72]  Basement suite
[10609.72 --> 10610.96]  That is under the office
[10610.96 --> 10612.18]  That he rents from me
[10612.18 --> 10613.26]  In the bedroom portion
[10613.26 --> 10613.90]  In the bedroom
[10613.90 --> 10614.38]  Okay
[10614.38 --> 10615.12]  In fairness
[10615.12 --> 10616.24]  Why
[10616.24 --> 10616.86]  Yeah
[10616.86 --> 10618.00]  Why did you not sleep
[10618.00 --> 10619.22]  In the proper bedroom
[10619.22 --> 10619.82]  Of the suite
[10619.82 --> 10620.36]  I forget
[10620.36 --> 10621.70]  Well there wasn't one
[10621.70 --> 10622.22]  Yeah
[10622.22 --> 10622.82]  Well okay
[10622.82 --> 10623.64]  It didn't have a window
[10623.64 --> 10624.38]  But it was like
[10624.38 --> 10625.50]  Kind of a bedroom
[10625.50 --> 10626.18]  Like format
[10626.18 --> 10628.08]  When you just came down
[10628.08 --> 10628.42]  The stairs
[10628.42 --> 10628.86]  That room
[10628.86 --> 10630.58]  So that was all I had
[10630.58 --> 10631.04]  At the beginning
[10631.04 --> 10633.28]  What
[10633.28 --> 10633.86]  Because
[10633.86 --> 10635.32]  No we didn't meet there
[10635.32 --> 10636.22]  No you were in the
[10636.22 --> 10637.30]  You were in the other side
[10637.30 --> 10637.68]  When we
[10637.68 --> 10638.80]  When we had our first
[10638.80 --> 10640.12]  Annual reviews I believe
[10640.12 --> 10641.36]  No
[10641.36 --> 10642.16]  Could be wrong
[10642.16 --> 10642.46]  Yeah
[10642.46 --> 10643.94]  Was that the second one then
[10643.94 --> 10645.54]  Maybe
[10645.54 --> 10646.70]  Oh wow
[10646.70 --> 10647.66]  Did we really meet
[10647.66 --> 10648.50]  In the little like
[10648.50 --> 10649.70]  The dungeon room
[10649.70 --> 10649.88]  Oh yeah
[10649.88 --> 10650.32]  100%
[10650.32 --> 10651.34]  That's amazing
[10651.34 --> 10653.38]  That definitely happened
[10653.38 --> 10654.78]  I remember that meeting
[10654.78 --> 10656.68]  Oh no
[10656.68 --> 10659.60]  Oh wow
[10659.60 --> 10661.02]  I also remember the other one
[10661.02 --> 10662.02]  So that must have been
[10662.02 --> 10662.74]  Yeah year two
[10662.74 --> 10663.54]  Yeah okay
[10663.54 --> 10664.22]  Because eventually
[10664.22 --> 10665.04]  I had the whole thing
[10665.04 --> 10665.60]  But at the beginning
[10665.60 --> 10666.40]  I just had the like
[10666.40 --> 10667.74]  Little cubby basically
[10667.74 --> 10668.50]  That's amazing
[10668.50 --> 10668.88]  Anyway
[10668.88 --> 10669.86]  Yeah
[10669.86 --> 10671.02]  So we
[10671.02 --> 10672.52]  We encourage
[10672.52 --> 10673.90]  We encourage feedback
[10673.90 --> 10675.44]  I think part of it
[10675.44 --> 10676.66]  Part of the challenge now
[10676.66 --> 10677.80]  Is I
[10677.80 --> 10680.82]  Don't say that
[10680.82 --> 10681.62]  I know
[10681.62 --> 10682.12]  I know
[10682.12 --> 10682.62]  I know
[10682.62 --> 10685.10]  F***ing float plane chat
[10685.10 --> 10688.54]  Anyway
[10688.54 --> 10692.42]  I think part of the problem now
[10692.42 --> 10693.56]  Is that I don't get to interact
[10693.56 --> 10694.48]  Personally with everyone
[10694.48 --> 10695.80]  And I don't get to build that rapport
[10695.80 --> 10697.50]  So it used to be
[10697.50 --> 10698.30]  That I think
[10698.30 --> 10699.44]  Everyone knew
[10699.44 --> 10700.14]  That they could
[10700.14 --> 10701.16]  Give me honest feedback
[10701.16 --> 10701.74]  They could tell me
[10701.74 --> 10702.24]  If they didn't think
[10702.24 --> 10703.14]  My work was very good
[10703.14 --> 10703.76]  They could tell me
[10703.76 --> 10704.48]  If they didn't think
[10704.48 --> 10705.38]  That my assessment
[10705.38 --> 10706.44]  Of their work was fair
[10706.44 --> 10707.70]  These days
[10707.70 --> 10708.38]  I don't
[10708.38 --> 10709.26]  I don't
[10709.26 --> 10709.90]  Think so
[10709.90 --> 10710.94]  But I think that
[10710.94 --> 10712.50]  If there's
[10712.50 --> 10713.24]  If there's
[10713.24 --> 10714.78]  One thing that I
[10714.78 --> 10716.78]  Can still say
[10716.78 --> 10717.34]  It's that
[10717.34 --> 10718.28]  We still try
[10718.28 --> 10718.82]  And we will
[10718.82 --> 10720.20]  We will always continue to try
[10720.20 --> 10720.72]  And that's something
[10720.72 --> 10721.76]  That I'm very proud of
[10721.76 --> 10722.58]  Because I think that's how
[10722.58 --> 10723.50]  We continue to get better
[10723.50 --> 10724.88]  I think it helps that
[10724.88 --> 10725.94]  A lot of the people
[10725.94 --> 10726.64]  From back then
[10726.64 --> 10727.38]  Are still around
[10727.38 --> 10728.24]  So
[10728.24 --> 10729.06]  That
[10729.06 --> 10730.88]  Mentality
[10730.88 --> 10732.00]  Or the
[10732.00 --> 10735.48]  How do I say this
[10735.48 --> 10736.72]  I feel like I'm lacking the words
[10736.72 --> 10740.30]  The people who
[10740.30 --> 10741.90]  Did it
[10741.90 --> 10742.78]  When we were like
[10742.78 --> 10743.74]  Small and agile
[10743.74 --> 10745.14]  And it wasn't that hard to do it
[10745.14 --> 10745.98]  Can
[10745.98 --> 10746.54]  Can
[10746.54 --> 10748.48]  Testament to the fact
[10748.48 --> 10749.42]  That it was done
[10749.42 --> 10750.12]  And it is a thing
[10750.12 --> 10750.96]  And it is still a thing
[10750.96 --> 10752.20]  If you know what I mean
[10752.20 --> 10754.14]  And I think that helps the culture
[10754.14 --> 10755.62]  Might not completely solve
[10755.62 --> 10756.94]  That problem
[10756.94 --> 10758.14]  Because I don't think you can
[10758.14 --> 10759.64]  But it helps
[10759.64 --> 10761.14]  But it's hard for those people
[10761.14 --> 10762.52]  To even tell if it's helping
[10762.52 --> 10764.12]  When now they're
[10764.12 --> 10764.42]  That's also happening
[10764.42 --> 10766.02]  In such a position of power
[10766.02 --> 10767.34]  That they may not be able
[10767.34 --> 10768.20]  To see everything
[10768.20 --> 10768.66]  Yeah
[10768.66 --> 10769.36]  Yeah
[10769.36 --> 10770.44]  Like there's always
[10770.44 --> 10771.36]  Going to be some insulation
[10771.36 --> 10772.14]  And that gets worse as we go on
[10772.14 --> 10772.54]  Yeah
[10772.54 --> 10775.28]  And the more layers there are
[10775.28 --> 10777.10]  The more insulated I am
[10777.10 --> 10778.66]  And
[10778.66 --> 10779.34]  Like I just
[10779.34 --> 10780.66]  I want to continue
[10780.66 --> 10781.76]  To try to do things
[10781.76 --> 10782.08]  Like
[10782.08 --> 10782.52]  Okay
[10782.52 --> 10783.54]  We just had our company
[10783.54 --> 10784.18]  Christmas party
[10784.18 --> 10785.24]  This Wednesday
[10785.24 --> 10785.60]  Yeah
[10785.60 --> 10785.78]  It's fun
[10785.78 --> 10786.38]  Yeah
[10786.38 --> 10786.78]  It was
[10786.78 --> 10787.52]  It was really good
[10787.52 --> 10788.18]  It was weird
[10788.18 --> 10789.44]  It's always weird
[10789.44 --> 10790.16]  I think
[10790.16 --> 10791.32]  It's always weird right
[10791.32 --> 10792.18]  It's always a little weird
[10792.18 --> 10792.54]  Yeah
[10792.54 --> 10793.48]  But
[10793.48 --> 10794.60]  Not in a bad way
[10794.60 --> 10795.08]  One of
[10795.08 --> 10795.98]  We have a couple
[10795.98 --> 10797.10]  Sort of main principles
[10797.10 --> 10798.22]  For the Christmas party
[10798.22 --> 10799.62]  One is that it's not work
[10799.62 --> 10801.34]  It is not content
[10801.34 --> 10804.00]  Yeah
[10804.00 --> 10804.38]  Yeah
[10804.38 --> 10805.08]  Two
[10805.08 --> 10807.08]  Is that it needs to be memorable
[10807.08 --> 10808.94]  They're always memorable
[10808.94 --> 10809.84]  They're always
[10809.84 --> 10810.88]  Always
[10810.88 --> 10813.16]  I have very distinct memories
[10813.16 --> 10813.98]  From all of them
[10813.98 --> 10815.14]  Some weird shit happens
[10815.14 --> 10815.54]  Yeah
[10815.54 --> 10816.36]  And not
[10816.36 --> 10817.12]  Not in like
[10817.12 --> 10817.78]  You know
[10817.78 --> 10818.16]  Like
[10818.16 --> 10819.28]  Drugged out
[10819.28 --> 10819.90]  Or like
[10819.90 --> 10820.84]  Anything like that
[10820.84 --> 10822.24]  We run it kind of like
[10822.24 --> 10822.94]  A wedding party
[10822.94 --> 10823.68]  Yeah
[10823.68 --> 10825.02]  That's a really good reference
[10825.02 --> 10825.42]  Actually
[10825.42 --> 10825.72]  Yeah
[10825.72 --> 10827.16]  So we'll play like
[10827.16 --> 10828.36]  Games where everyone
[10828.36 --> 10829.52]  Gets up out of their chairs
[10829.52 --> 10831.12]  And goes and just
[10831.12 --> 10832.16]  Okay
[10832.16 --> 10833.58]  We played a game this year
[10833.58 --> 10834.36]  That involved
[10834.36 --> 10835.02]  Like
[10835.02 --> 10835.66]  Like
[10835.66 --> 10836.06]  Like
[10836.06 --> 10836.58]  Flag
[10836.58 --> 10837.46]  Capture
[10837.46 --> 10838.02]  Like
[10838.02 --> 10838.72]  Like you
[10838.72 --> 10839.26]  You have a
[10839.26 --> 10839.94]  Like a belt
[10839.94 --> 10840.48]  With a
[10840.48 --> 10841.04]  With a tail
[10841.04 --> 10842.66]  Like
[10842.66 --> 10842.90]  What
[10842.90 --> 10843.94]  What kind of games
[10843.94 --> 10844.72]  Are played like that
[10844.72 --> 10845.14]  It's just
[10845.14 --> 10846.02]  I think flag football
[10846.02 --> 10846.54]  Is the best reference
[10846.54 --> 10846.74]  Yeah
[10846.74 --> 10847.58]  But you weren't allowed
[10847.58 --> 10848.52]  Like running and stuff
[10848.52 --> 10848.78]  And then
[10848.78 --> 10849.52]  You had
[10849.52 --> 10850.88]  You had people inside
[10850.88 --> 10852.84]  That had to steal the flags
[10852.84 --> 10853.36]  Yeah
[10853.36 --> 10853.84]  And then you had to
[10853.84 --> 10854.80]  Hand off the flag
[10854.80 --> 10856.44]  To a designated hacker
[10856.44 --> 10857.56]  And the hacker
[10857.56 --> 10858.74]  Had to use codes
[10858.74 --> 10859.78]  That were on the flags
[10859.78 --> 10860.94]  To like break into locks
[10860.94 --> 10862.66]  What I thought was hilarious
[10862.66 --> 10864.00]  Was the amount of people
[10864.00 --> 10864.92]  From my team
[10864.92 --> 10865.82]  That were designated
[10865.82 --> 10866.52]  The hackers
[10866.52 --> 10867.50]  Because there's all like
[10867.50 --> 10868.54]  The developers and stuff
[10868.54 --> 10869.14]  That were distributed
[10869.14 --> 10870.08]  Amongst all the tables
[10870.08 --> 10871.52]  So like half the hackers
[10871.52 --> 10872.14]  Were just people
[10872.14 --> 10873.28]  From my team
[10873.28 --> 10875.22]  Which was great
[10875.22 --> 10875.86]  I thought that was
[10875.86 --> 10876.36]  Really funny
[10876.36 --> 10877.70]  Yeah the theme was
[10877.70 --> 10879.28]  The theme was
[10879.28 --> 10880.50]  This year
[10880.50 --> 10881.26]  Was sort of
[10881.26 --> 10882.44]  Events
[10882.44 --> 10883.32]  That took place
[10883.32 --> 10884.46]  So that game
[10884.46 --> 10885.78]  Was obviously
[10885.78 --> 10886.78]  About the hack
[10886.78 --> 10888.72]  I don't know
[10888.72 --> 10888.98]  Just
[10888.98 --> 10890.06]  And you know what
[10890.06 --> 10891.14]  Most of the time
[10891.14 --> 10891.86]  The games don't really
[10891.86 --> 10892.46]  Work out the way
[10892.46 --> 10893.16]  That we envisioned
[10893.16 --> 10894.68]  But they're always
[10894.68 --> 10895.68]  This year was pretty
[10895.68 --> 10896.56]  Rampant with cheating
[10896.56 --> 10898.22]  On both games
[10898.22 --> 10898.76]  It was like
[10898.76 --> 10899.56]  Brutal
[10899.56 --> 10900.74]  But I mean
[10900.74 --> 10901.22]  Whatever
[10901.22 --> 10902.08]  It's just supposed
[10902.08 --> 10902.68]  To be fun
[10902.68 --> 10902.96]  Right
[10902.96 --> 10904.16]  I don't know
[10904.16 --> 10904.44]  Yeah
[10904.44 --> 10905.80]  And I like to think
[10905.80 --> 10906.16]  People have
[10906.16 --> 10907.60]  We have costumes
[10907.60 --> 10909.08]  We dress up
[10909.08 --> 10909.36]  Yeah
[10909.36 --> 10911.36]  What year did that start
[10911.36 --> 10912.60]  Was that the year
[10912.60 --> 10913.30]  That we did the
[10913.30 --> 10913.58]  Like
[10913.58 --> 10914.68]  Was that the
[10914.68 --> 10916.20]  10 million subscriber year
[10916.20 --> 10917.36]  I think that was
[10917.36 --> 10917.92]  One of the years
[10917.92 --> 10918.88]  When I was banned
[10918.88 --> 10920.84]  Well you weren't banned
[10920.84 --> 10921.76]  You just weren't invited
[10921.76 --> 10924.08]  I was not allowed
[10924.08 --> 10925.04]  That's the same as banned
[10925.04 --> 10927.24]  Okay
[10927.24 --> 10928.86]  You can flavor that wording
[10928.86 --> 10929.70]  As much as you want
[10929.70 --> 10931.08]  It's a little
[10931.08 --> 10932.44]  More nuanced
[10932.44 --> 10933.10]  Than what
[10933.10 --> 10933.88]  Not that much
[10933.88 --> 10934.56]  It's a little
[10934.56 --> 10935.12]  More nuanced
[10935.12 --> 10936.12]  It's a little
[10936.12 --> 10936.92]  More nuanced
[10936.92 --> 10939.54]  And I think
[10939.54 --> 10939.98]  That would be
[10939.98 --> 10941.06]  A much longer
[10941.06 --> 10941.96]  Conversation
[10941.96 --> 10942.46]  Than we're going
[10942.46 --> 10942.92]  To be having
[10942.92 --> 10943.96]  About it right now
[10943.96 --> 10946.56]  Speaking of people
[10946.56 --> 10947.52]  Not being afraid
[10947.52 --> 10948.70]  To speak
[10948.70 --> 10950.42]  Speak their minds
[10950.42 --> 10951.40]  Without fear
[10951.40 --> 10952.34]  Of retaliation
[10952.34 --> 10953.02]  You f***
[10953.02 --> 10957.12]  That'd never
[10957.12 --> 10957.66]  Been a problem
[10957.66 --> 10958.24]  Yeah
[10958.24 --> 10959.34]  Yeah
[10959.34 --> 10960.36]  Yeah
[10960.36 --> 10961.50]  Maybe it should be
[10961.50 --> 10962.42]  More of a problem
[10962.42 --> 10964.92]  I was the one
[10964.92 --> 10965.58]  That was banned
[10965.58 --> 10968.80]  Anywho
[10968.80 --> 10970.08]  We started
[10970.08 --> 10970.96]  It is more nuanced
[10970.96 --> 10971.22]  Than that
[10971.22 --> 10971.80]  I'm just trolling
[10971.80 --> 10973.60]  Very effectively
[10973.60 --> 10975.12]  Anywho
[10975.12 --> 10976.32]  We started this
[10976.32 --> 10977.10]  Costume thing
[10977.10 --> 10978.20]  And the first year
[10978.20 --> 10979.74]  We were like
[10979.74 --> 10980.86]  Hey there's going to be
[10980.86 --> 10981.50]  A theme
[10981.50 --> 10982.82]  And you should
[10982.82 --> 10983.66]  You should dress up
[10983.66 --> 10984.52]  According to the theme
[10984.52 --> 10986.50]  And we didn't say
[10986.50 --> 10987.96]  Why they should do that
[10987.96 --> 10988.96]  And
[10988.96 --> 10990.78]  So some people did
[10990.78 --> 10991.58]  Did not that many?
[10992.10 --> 10993.14]  I think it was about
[10993.14 --> 10993.80]  50-50
[10993.80 --> 10994.18]  Maybe
[10994.18 --> 10995.76]  So the people that
[10995.76 --> 10996.30]  Showed up
[10996.30 --> 10997.22]  A lot higher percentage now
[10997.22 --> 10998.00]  The people that
[10998.00 --> 10998.92]  Well I was getting to that
[10998.92 --> 10999.32]  But yeah
[10999.32 --> 11000.62]  The people that showed up
[11000.62 --> 11001.78]  Found out
[11001.78 --> 11002.46]  That there was
[11002.46 --> 11003.76]  Like a costume contest
[11003.76 --> 11004.64]  And there was
[11004.64 --> 11005.70]  There was awards
[11005.70 --> 11006.70]  And you could get tickets
[11006.70 --> 11007.84]  For having the most
[11007.84 --> 11008.78]  Inventive
[11008.78 --> 11009.80]  Or having the most
[11009.80 --> 11012.02]  Complicated
[11012.02 --> 11012.76]  Or I forget
[11012.76 --> 11013.10]  I forget
[11013.10 --> 11013.66]  Or the funniest
[11013.66 --> 11014.58]  Or whatever else
[11014.58 --> 11016.14]  And no one knew
[11016.14 --> 11016.98]  What the tickets were for
[11016.98 --> 11017.68]  But we were giving out
[11017.68 --> 11018.42]  Tickets all night
[11018.42 --> 11019.24]  For participating
[11019.24 --> 11020.18]  In the games
[11020.18 --> 11020.78]  And for
[11020.78 --> 11022.70]  For dressing according
[11022.70 --> 11023.74]  To the theme of the party
[11023.74 --> 11024.62]  And everything like that
[11024.62 --> 11025.50]  And then at the end
[11025.50 --> 11027.36]  It turned out
[11027.36 --> 11028.36]  That the tickets
[11028.36 --> 11029.54]  Were for a raffle
[11029.54 --> 11031.08]  That had
[11031.08 --> 11032.60]  Crazy
[11032.60 --> 11033.74]  Crazy
[11033.74 --> 11034.56]  Stuff in it
[11034.56 --> 11036.52]  Like just crazy
[11036.52 --> 11037.58]  And so
[11037.58 --> 11038.42]  Overnight
[11038.42 --> 11040.26]  From the first one
[11040.26 --> 11041.30]  To the second one
[11041.30 --> 11042.10]  We went from
[11042.10 --> 11043.58]  Tepid participation
[11043.58 --> 11044.44]  To
[11044.44 --> 11046.16]  100%
[11046.16 --> 11046.62]  No I think
[11046.62 --> 11047.24]  Was it actually?
[11047.40 --> 11048.72]  We were over 100%
[11048.72 --> 11049.78]  Participation this year
[11049.78 --> 11050.90]  Because even
[11050.90 --> 11052.50]  Non-employees
[11052.50 --> 11053.46]  Were dressed according
[11053.46 --> 11054.30]  To the theme of the night
[11054.30 --> 11056.08]  I consider that
[11056.08 --> 11057.80]  Over 100% participation
[11057.80 --> 11059.00]  Okay so a non-employee
[11059.00 --> 11060.12]  Counts towards the
[11060.12 --> 11061.06]  Then I think so
[11061.06 --> 11061.78]  Yeah I think we're
[11061.78 --> 11062.46]  Over 100%
[11062.46 --> 11063.02]  Did you see
[11063.02 --> 11063.64]  Did you see what
[11063.64 --> 11064.26]  Emma's was?
[11064.38 --> 11064.94]  I thought it was
[11064.94 --> 11065.54]  Hilarious
[11065.54 --> 11067.58]  I thought it was so funny
[11067.58 --> 11067.92]  I don't think I caught Emma's
[11067.92 --> 11068.48]  I'm so sorry
[11068.48 --> 11069.42]  She came late
[11069.42 --> 11070.66]  So it's not too surprising
[11070.66 --> 11071.54]  But she had
[11071.54 --> 11072.84]  She wore one of my
[11072.84 --> 11074.14]  Oh this year
[11074.14 --> 11074.60]  The theme was
[11074.60 --> 11075.26]  The food groups
[11075.26 --> 11076.42]  Yeah so my
[11076.42 --> 11077.16]  My team
[11077.16 --> 11077.80]  Was
[11077.80 --> 11078.82]  Cereal
[11078.82 --> 11080.80]  So she
[11080.80 --> 11081.86]  She threw this together
[11081.86 --> 11082.84]  Like super last minute
[11082.84 --> 11083.44]  Because she didn't know
[11083.44 --> 11084.14]  Plus ones were supposed
[11084.14 --> 11084.62]  To dress up
[11084.62 --> 11086.02]  Because I got the
[11086.02 --> 11086.80]  News of the theme
[11086.80 --> 11087.74]  While I was in Japan
[11087.74 --> 11088.38]  So whatever
[11088.38 --> 11089.18]  I didn't even know
[11089.18 --> 11089.92]  Plus ones were supposed
[11089.92 --> 11090.22]  To dress up
[11090.22 --> 11090.50]  Were they?
[11090.70 --> 11092.08]  It's not supposed to
[11092.08 --> 11093.14]  But they were invited to
[11093.14 --> 11093.26]  Sure
[11093.26 --> 11094.06]  Okay cool
[11094.06 --> 11095.58]  So she grabbed one of
[11095.58 --> 11096.78]  My donut media
[11096.78 --> 11097.46]  Merch shirts
[11097.46 --> 11099.04]  That has just
[11099.04 --> 11100.46]  Cans of beans on it
[11100.46 --> 11101.74]  Because give it the beans
[11101.74 --> 11102.14]  Or whatever
[11102.14 --> 11104.10]  And she crossed out
[11104.10 --> 11105.48]  With green painter's tape
[11105.48 --> 11106.40]  All of the cans
[11106.40 --> 11107.82]  Except for two of them
[11107.82 --> 11109.46]  And then wore a name tag
[11109.46 --> 11110.42]  That just said Sam
[11110.42 --> 11112.80]  Two cans Sam
[11112.80 --> 11114.74]  Actually
[11114.74 --> 11116.46]  So funny
[11116.46 --> 11117.30]  And I think
[11117.30 --> 11118.26]  I think like
[11118.26 --> 11119.88]  Almost nobody got it
[11119.88 --> 11121.02]  So it didn't get like
[11121.02 --> 11122.18]  The credit that it deserved
[11122.18 --> 11123.60]  But it was great
[11123.60 --> 11125.36]  It was so good
[11125.36 --> 11126.66]  It was so cool
[11126.66 --> 11128.04]  Seeing what some of the
[11128.04 --> 11128.82]  Teams put together
[11128.82 --> 11129.92]  Riley was
[11129.92 --> 11130.86]  Was a
[11130.86 --> 11132.54]  Super ethical farmer
[11132.54 --> 11133.94]  And then
[11133.94 --> 11134.24]  Oh yeah
[11134.24 --> 11134.60]  Yeah
[11134.60 --> 11135.36]  And his team
[11135.36 --> 11136.22]  Was
[11136.22 --> 11137.84]  I really like the whole team
[11137.84 --> 11138.22]  Like
[11138.22 --> 11139.30]  The live animals
[11139.30 --> 11139.94]  Yeah
[11139.94 --> 11141.14]  And then like
[11141.14 --> 11142.02]  The product
[11142.02 --> 11143.10]  Of the animals
[11143.10 --> 11144.78]  And then they had a butcher
[11144.78 --> 11146.32]  What was
[11146.32 --> 11147.36]  What was the chef's name
[11147.36 --> 11148.28]  I forget
[11148.28 --> 11149.54]  I don't remember the chef's name
[11149.54 --> 11150.46]  But he had a
[11150.46 --> 11151.48]  Minecraft sword
[11151.48 --> 11151.88]  Yeah
[11151.88 --> 11153.20]  And so like
[11153.20 --> 11153.72]  During the
[11153.72 --> 11154.82]  During the judging
[11154.82 --> 11155.94]  We had the plus ones
[11155.94 --> 11157.12]  Do like an applause-o-meter
[11157.12 --> 11158.64]  Like judging thing
[11158.64 --> 11159.48]  And
[11159.48 --> 11161.50]  Riley would like
[11161.50 --> 11162.22]  Bring the animals
[11162.22 --> 11162.84]  To the butcher
[11162.84 --> 11163.48]  And he'd like
[11163.48 --> 11163.92]  Kill them
[11163.92 --> 11164.56]  And then they
[11164.56 --> 11166.20]  They'd have the product
[11166.20 --> 11166.68]  I don't know
[11166.68 --> 11167.78]  It was a whole
[11167.78 --> 11169.06]  I love like
[11169.06 --> 11170.12]  Cohesive
[11170.12 --> 11171.20]  Everybody has to be involved
[11171.20 --> 11172.00]  For it to work well
[11172.00 --> 11172.46]  Themes
[11172.46 --> 11173.52]  I think those are great
[11173.52 --> 11174.40]  Super cool
[11174.40 --> 11175.48]  Oh
[11175.48 --> 11176.60]  Sweets
[11176.60 --> 11177.18]  A candy
[11177.18 --> 11178.42]  Candy was
[11178.42 --> 11181.52]  A bunch of M&M's
[11181.52 --> 11182.52]  And then
[11182.52 --> 11183.24]  David
[11183.24 --> 11184.42]  Draft up as a
[11184.42 --> 11185.28]  Sugar daddy
[11185.28 --> 11186.56]  His costume
[11186.56 --> 11187.32]  Was amazing
[11187.32 --> 11191.42]  I was having a
[11191.42 --> 11192.24]  Really hard time
[11192.24 --> 11192.76]  With cereal
[11192.76 --> 11193.80]  I couldn't figure out
[11193.80 --> 11194.14]  Anything
[11194.14 --> 11195.36]  I kept leaning
[11195.36 --> 11195.96]  Towards like
[11195.96 --> 11196.94]  Do I run with it
[11196.94 --> 11197.44]  Too far
[11197.44 --> 11197.86]  And do like
[11197.86 --> 11198.46]  Serial killer
[11198.46 --> 11198.92]  But I was like
[11198.92 --> 11199.28]  No
[11199.28 --> 11200.16]  Yeah it's almost
[11200.16 --> 11200.76]  Too obvious
[11200.76 --> 11201.28]  Yeah
[11201.28 --> 11201.84]  No I thought
[11201.84 --> 11202.36]  I thought the
[11202.36 --> 11202.80]  Serial team
[11202.80 --> 11203.42]  Did a great job
[11203.42 --> 11203.84]  And then I
[11203.84 --> 11204.58]  Liked what I
[11204.58 --> 11205.34]  Ended up coming up
[11205.34 --> 11205.54]  With
[11205.54 --> 11205.92]  I
[11205.92 --> 11206.48]  So
[11206.48 --> 11208.12]  Joe and I
[11208.12 --> 11208.78]  Were making
[11208.78 --> 11209.40]  Our costumes
[11209.40 --> 11209.86]  Together
[11209.86 --> 11210.28]  Yeah
[11210.28 --> 11210.66]  But we went
[11210.66 --> 11211.06]  To go do it
[11211.06 --> 11211.72]  At my place
[11211.72 --> 11212.22]  And Joe
[11212.22 --> 11212.94]  Needed to use
[11212.94 --> 11213.30]  Like
[11213.30 --> 11214.40]  Oil
[11214.40 --> 11215.60]  Markers
[11215.60 --> 11216.28]  And
[11216.28 --> 11217.32]  Glue
[11217.32 --> 11217.86]  And stuff
[11217.86 --> 11218.72]  So we were
[11218.72 --> 11219.18]  Like okay
[11219.18 --> 11219.76]  Well we can't
[11219.76 --> 11220.18]  Do this
[11220.18 --> 11220.64]  Because the
[11220.64 --> 11221.02]  Birds
[11221.02 --> 11221.84]  So we can't
[11221.84 --> 11222.34]  Have fumes
[11222.34 --> 11223.14]  So we were
[11223.14 --> 11223.66]  Sitting in the
[11223.66 --> 11224.34]  Lobby of my
[11224.34 --> 11224.74]  Apartment
[11224.74 --> 11225.34]  Oh my gosh
[11225.34 --> 11226.00]  Making the
[11226.00 --> 11226.58]  Costumes
[11226.58 --> 11227.22]  And people
[11227.22 --> 11228.06]  Kept walking
[11228.06 --> 11228.44]  By
[11228.44 --> 11229.30]  While I'm
[11229.30 --> 11229.98]  Like making
[11229.98 --> 11231.04]  Cheerios
[11231.04 --> 11231.98]  Out of cardboard
[11231.98 --> 11233.24]  And he's
[11233.24 --> 11233.78]  Drawing a
[11233.78 --> 11234.44]  Ketchup label
[11234.44 --> 11235.06]  On felt
[11235.06 --> 11235.60]  And they're
[11235.60 --> 11235.90]  Just
[11235.90 --> 11236.66]  Some of
[11236.66 --> 11237.36]  Some of
[11237.36 --> 11237.72]  The looks
[11237.72 --> 11238.18]  We got
[11238.18 --> 11239.44]  Were amazing
[11239.44 --> 11241.26]  No one
[11241.26 --> 11241.80]  Asked like
[11241.80 --> 11242.20]  Why are you
[11242.20 --> 11242.56]  Doing this
[11242.56 --> 11242.88]  Here
[11242.88 --> 11243.64]  No one
[11243.64 --> 11244.04]  Asked that
[11244.04 --> 11244.38]  Question
[11244.38 --> 11245.24]  Which was
[11245.24 --> 11245.58]  Because it
[11245.58 --> 11246.04]  Was obvious
[11246.04 --> 11246.38]  Because you
[11246.38 --> 11246.78]  Can't do it
[11246.78 --> 11247.24]  Somewhere else
[11247.24 --> 11248.44]  Clearly
[11248.44 --> 11248.98]  I mean
[11248.98 --> 11249.18]  No one
[11249.18 --> 11249.50]  Would choose
[11249.50 --> 11250.00]  To be there
[11250.00 --> 11251.28]  Anyway it
[11251.28 --> 11251.56]  Was really
[11251.56 --> 11252.66]  It was really
[11252.66 --> 11252.92]  Fun
[11252.92 --> 11253.22]  It was a
[11253.22 --> 11253.84]  Total blast
[11253.84 --> 11254.86]  Massive
[11254.86 --> 11255.28]  Shout out

[11263.14 --> 11263.68]  Heads cut off
[11263.68 --> 11264.02]  And like
[11264.02 --> 11264.24]  We don't
[11264.24 --> 11264.54]  Really get
[11264.54 --> 11265.18]  To process

[11344.90 --> 11345.28]  Tech
[11345.28 --> 11345.58]  In
[11345.58 --> 11346.02]  Construction
[11346.02 --> 11346.44]  Like
[11346.44 --> 11347.04]  Autonomous
[11347.04 --> 11347.46]  Equipment
[11347.46 --> 11348.16]  Offsite
[11348.16 --> 11348.58]  Control
[11348.58 --> 11349.28]  Trucks
[11349.28 --> 11349.72]  That shut
[11349.72 --> 11349.94]  Down
[11349.94 --> 11350.52]  Automatically
[11350.52 --> 11350.90]  Or

[11362.06 --> 11362.56]  That immediately
[11362.56 --> 11363.36]  Yeah but it's
[11363.36 --> 11364.08]  Also it's
[11364.08 --> 11365.10]  It's basically
[11365.10 --> 11366.68]  Depending on what
[11366.68 --> 11367.16]  You're trying to
[11367.16 --> 11367.84]  Do it's it's
[11367.84 --> 11368.36]  Basically a
[11368.36 --> 11369.02]  Robo vacuum
[11369.02 --> 11369.72]  I mean yeah
[11369.72 --> 11370.50]  It's awesome
[11370.50 --> 11371.08]  The things that
[11371.08 --> 11371.74]  Could go wrong
[11371.74 --> 11372.36]  Compared to
[11372.36 --> 11373.32]  Autonomous
[11373.32 --> 11373.94]  Equipment
[11373.94 --> 11374.50]  In like
[11374.50 --> 11375.34]  Construction
[11375.34 --> 11376.24]  This is the

[11376.78 --> 11377.40]  I was having
[11377.40 --> 11377.84]  Yeah
[11377.84 --> 11378.56]  Autonomous
[11378.56 --> 11379.16]  Equipment
[11379.16 --> 11379.66]  In construction
[11379.66 --> 11380.32]  Sounds terrifying
[11380.32 --> 11380.80]  Like it's just
[11380.80 --> 11381.32]  A plow
[11381.32 --> 11381.92]  Offsite
[11381.92 --> 11382.30]  Control
[11382.30 --> 11383.04]  Just plow
[11383.04 --> 11383.62]  Sounds like
[11383.62 --> 11384.00]  You're missing
[11384.00 --> 11384.48]  A lot of
[11384.48 --> 11384.86]  Sensory
[11384.86 --> 11385.34]  Information
[11385.34 --> 11385.92]  For safety
[11385.92 --> 11386.36]  Reasons
[11386.36 --> 11387.08]  Trucks
[11387.08 --> 11387.50]  That shut
[11387.50 --> 11387.68]  Down
[11387.68 --> 11388.34]  Automatically
[11388.34 --> 11388.86]  Sounds
[11388.86 --> 11391.16]  Really bad
[11391.16 --> 11391.56]  Like I
[11391.56 --> 11392.24]  I don't know
[11392.24 --> 11392.50]  About you
[11392.50 --> 11393.16]  But I want
[11393.16 --> 11394.56]  Actual humans
[11394.56 --> 11395.66]  Operating the
[11395.66 --> 11396.50]  Heavy machinery
[11396.50 --> 11397.24]  For better or
[11397.24 --> 11397.76]  For worse
[11397.76 --> 11398.34]  I want
[11398.34 --> 11399.10]  Trained actual
[11399.10 --> 11399.50]  Humans
[11399.50 --> 11400.00]  For now
[11400.00 --> 11400.80]  But GPS
[11400.80 --> 11401.26]  Farming
[11401.26 --> 11401.50]  Yeah
[11401.50 --> 11401.96]  Cool
[11401.96 --> 11402.64]  Is sick
[11402.64 --> 11403.00]  Alright
[11403.00 --> 11405.28]  Hey

[11406.26 --> 11407.20]  And greetings
[11407.20 --> 11407.74]  From Europe
[11407.74 --> 11408.52]  Linus
[11408.52 --> 11408.90]  Will you get
[11408.90 --> 11409.28]  Your hands
[11409.28 --> 11409.56]  On the
[11409.56 --> 11410.08]  Ioneo
[11410.08 --> 11410.54]  With mini
[11410.54 --> 11410.94]  LED
[11410.94 --> 11411.80]  And how
[11411.80 --> 11412.12]  Do you see
[11412.12 --> 11412.92]  Mini LED
[11412.92 --> 11413.54]  Compared to
[11413.54 --> 11413.84]  OLED
[11413.84 --> 11414.92]  Um
[11414.92 --> 11415.86]  I actually
[11415.86 --> 11416.40]  Wasn't aware
[11416.40 --> 11416.96]  Of it yet
[11416.96 --> 11417.58]  I am
[11417.58 --> 11418.56]  Super happy
[11418.56 --> 11419.12]  With
[11419.12 --> 11420.18]  Ugh
[11420.18 --> 11421.88]  I love
[11421.88 --> 11422.32]  The RG
[11422.32 --> 11422.60]  Ally
[11422.60 --> 11423.20]  And I love
[11423.20 --> 11423.60]  The Steam Deck
[11423.60 --> 11423.78]  OLED
[11423.78 --> 11424.20]  And I'm not
[11424.20 --> 11424.56]  Sure which
[11424.56 --> 11425.20]  One to play
[11425.20 --> 11425.96]  Octopath Traveler
[11425.96 --> 11426.08]  On
[11426.08 --> 11427.58]  I started it
[11427.58 --> 11427.98]  And I'm
[11427.98 --> 11428.66]  Actually not
[11428.66 --> 11429.26]  Really enjoying
[11429.26 --> 11429.64]  It though
[11429.64 --> 11431.26]  I got to
[11431.26 --> 11432.00]  The first
[11432.00 --> 11433.02]  Like boss
[11433.02 --> 11433.32]  Fight
[11433.32 --> 11434.40]  In the first
[11434.40 --> 11434.98]  Scenario
[11434.98 --> 11436.54]  Got my
[11436.54 --> 11437.22]  Ass
[11437.22 --> 11437.90]  Absolutely
[11437.90 --> 11438.62]  Handed to
[11438.62 --> 11438.86]  Me
[11438.86 --> 11439.70]  In a way
[11439.70 --> 11439.94]  That I
[11439.94 --> 11440.12]  Just
[11440.12 --> 11440.80]  Don't
[11440.80 --> 11441.18]  I didn't
[11441.18 --> 11441.52]  Even
[11441.52 --> 11441.84]  Really
[11441.84 --> 11442.38]  Understand
[11442.38 --> 11443.02]  It felt
[11443.02 --> 11444.30]  Completely
[11444.30 --> 11444.90]  Unfair
[11444.90 --> 11445.86]  Octopath Traveler
[11445.86 --> 11446.24]  Oh yeah
[11446.24 --> 11447.10]  Um
[11447.10 --> 11448.04]  And
[11448.04 --> 11448.64]  Yeah
[11448.64 --> 11448.90]  Maybe
[11448.90 --> 11449.16]  Yeah
[11449.16 --> 11449.54]  Maybe
[11449.54 --> 11449.80]  It's
[11449.80 --> 11450.04]  Maybe
[11450.04 --> 11450.20]  It's
[11450.20 --> 11451.18]  User
[11451.18 --> 11451.46]  Error
[11451.46 --> 11452.32]  It's
[11452.32 --> 11452.90]  Beautiful
[11452.90 --> 11453.52]  It's
[11453.52 --> 11455.50]  Beautiful
[11455.50 --> 11457.12]  But also
[11457.12 --> 11457.74]  It's just
[11457.74 --> 11458.12]  It's just
[11458.12 --> 11458.54]  Felt kind
[11458.54 --> 11458.68]  Of
[11458.68 --> 11458.96]  Like
[11458.96 --> 11459.50]  Shallow
[11459.50 --> 11460.34]  So far
[11460.34 --> 11461.34]  I don't
[11461.34 --> 11461.52]  Know
[11461.52 --> 11461.74]  And
[11461.74 --> 11461.94]  Yeah
[11461.94 --> 11462.14]  I'm
[11462.14 --> 11462.66]  Sure
[11462.66 --> 11462.84]  It's
[11462.84 --> 11463.14]  A skill
[11463.14 --> 11463.40]  Issue
[11463.40 --> 11463.62]  But I
[11463.62 --> 11463.82]  Just
[11463.82 --> 11464.86]  I don't
[11464.86 --> 11465.02]  Know
[11465.02 --> 11465.58]  It's
[11465.58 --> 11465.94]  It's a
[11465.94 --> 11466.08]  New
[11466.08 --> 11466.32]  Game
[11466.32 --> 11466.56]  So it
[11466.56 --> 11466.76]  Doesn't
[11466.76 --> 11466.96]  Come
[11466.96 --> 11467.18]  With a
[11467.18 --> 11467.50]  Manual
[11467.50 --> 11468.36]  Um
[11468.36 --> 11469.58]  It showed
[11469.58 --> 11470.24]  Me how
[11470.24 --> 11470.52]  To
[11470.52 --> 11472.08]  You know
[11472.08 --> 11472.62]  Stack up
[11472.62 --> 11473.18]  Attacks or
[11473.18 --> 11473.40]  Whatever
[11473.40 --> 11473.68]  But I'm
[11473.68 --> 11473.96]  Sitting here
[11473.96 --> 11474.30]  Going like
[11474.30 --> 11474.60]  What I'm
[11474.60 --> 11475.16]  Supposed to
[11475.16 --> 11476.12]  I'm
[11476.12 --> 11476.52]  Supposed to
[11476.52 --> 11476.88]  Need like
[11476.88 --> 11477.22]  Multiple
[11477.22 --> 11477.74]  Potions
[11477.74 --> 11478.36]  To heal
[11478.36 --> 11478.70]  My guy
[11478.70 --> 11478.92]  And like
[11478.92 --> 11479.18]  First
[11479.18 --> 11479.46]  Boss
[11479.46 --> 11479.62]  Fight
[11479.62 --> 11479.82]  I thought
[11479.82 --> 11479.92]  I'm
[11479.92 --> 11480.04]  Just
[11480.04 --> 11480.20]  Still
[11480.20 --> 11480.42]  Learning
[11480.42 --> 11480.58]  The
[11480.58 --> 11480.74]  Game
[11480.74 --> 11481.20]  Mechanics
[11481.20 --> 11481.80]  But
[11481.80 --> 11482.02]  Then
[11482.02 --> 11482.32]  My
[11482.32 --> 11482.74]  Understanding
[11482.74 --> 11482.90]  Of
[11482.90 --> 11483.20]  The game
[11483.20 --> 11483.78]  Is that
[11483.78 --> 11484.62]  You play
[11484.62 --> 11485.72]  All eight
[11485.72 --> 11486.02]  Of the
[11486.02 --> 11486.62]  Campaigns
[11486.62 --> 11487.18]  So I guess
[11487.18 --> 11487.46]  They have to
[11487.46 --> 11487.84]  Be difficult
[11487.84 --> 11488.26]  Enough that
[11488.26 --> 11488.62]  By the time
[11488.62 --> 11488.88]  You're doing
[11488.88 --> 11489.24]  The eighth
[11489.24 --> 11489.54]  One
[11489.54 --> 11490.28]  Which is
[11490.28 --> 11490.60]  The same
[11490.60 --> 11490.88]  Whether you
[11490.88 --> 11491.12]  Play it
[11491.12 --> 11491.48]  First or
[11491.48 --> 11491.82]  Last
[11491.82 --> 11493.22]  It still
[11493.22 --> 11493.68]  Has to be
[11493.68 --> 11494.18]  Challenging
[11494.18 --> 11494.58]  And interesting
[11494.58 --> 11495.08]  There are
[11495.08 --> 11495.56]  Games that
[11495.56 --> 11495.94]  Have done
[11495.94 --> 11496.44]  Difficulty
[11496.44 --> 11496.82]  Shifting
[11496.82 --> 11497.28]  Based on
[11497.28 --> 11497.68]  Your order
[11497.68 --> 11498.06]  Before
[11498.06 --> 11498.72]  I guess
[11498.72 --> 11499.02]  So
[11499.02 --> 11499.38]  Like they
[11499.38 --> 11499.96]  Can scale
[11499.96 --> 11500.58]  Each one
[11500.58 --> 11502.68]  Yeah
[11502.68 --> 11503.18]  I don't know
[11503.18 --> 11504.26]  Um
[11504.26 --> 11506.50]  Anywho
[11506.50 --> 11508.78]  Oh right
[11508.78 --> 11509.02]  Yeah
[11509.02 --> 11509.44]  Oh right
[11509.44 --> 11509.92]  So I can't
[11509.92 --> 11510.26]  Decide
[11510.26 --> 11510.78]  I couldn't
[11510.78 --> 11511.18]  Even decide
[11511.18 --> 11511.52]  Which one
[11511.52 --> 11511.92]  To play it
[11511.92 --> 11512.06]  On
[11512.06 --> 11512.48]  I really
[11512.48 --> 11512.80]  Like them
[11512.80 --> 11513.08]  Both
[11513.08 --> 11515.16]  I don't
[11515.16 --> 11515.58]  Mini LED
[11515.58 --> 11515.98]  Is cool
[11515.98 --> 11517.02]  But I
[11517.02 --> 11518.00]  See it as
[11518.00 --> 11518.48]  Kind of a
[11518.48 --> 11519.12]  Stepping stone
[11519.12 --> 11519.68]  To OLED
[11519.68 --> 11520.30]  As long
[11520.30 --> 11520.90]  As your
[11520.90 --> 11521.56]  Use case
[11521.56 --> 11522.36]  Isn't going
[11522.36 --> 11522.98]  To have
[11522.98 --> 11523.32]  Burn and
[11523.32 --> 11523.66]  Be an
[11523.66 --> 11523.96]  Enormous
[11523.96 --> 11524.26]  Problem
[11524.26 --> 11524.72]  For you
[11524.72 --> 11525.44]  And I
[11525.44 --> 11526.06]  Would rather
[11526.06 --> 11526.56]  Just have
[11526.56 --> 11526.94]  OLED
[11526.94 --> 11527.40]  But the
[11527.40 --> 11527.92]  Steam Deck
[11527.92 --> 11528.74]  Is not as
[11528.74 --> 11529.36]  Powerful as
[11529.36 --> 11529.74]  The ally
[11529.74 --> 11530.84]  Right now
[11530.84 --> 11531.20]  They're both
[11531.20 --> 11531.74]  Great options
[11531.74 --> 11532.18]  I can't even
[11532.18 --> 11532.66]  Decide which
[11532.66 --> 11532.90]  One I
[11532.90 --> 11533.12]  Would want
[11533.12 --> 11533.36]  To play
[11533.36 --> 11533.60]  A game
[11533.60 --> 11533.76]  On
[11533.76 --> 11536.10]  As a
[11536.10 --> 11536.92]  Dev manager
[11536.92 --> 11537.34]  At
[11537.34 --> 11538.26]  Technology
[11538.26 --> 11539.02]  Corporation
[11539.02 --> 11539.96]  Laying off
[11539.96 --> 11541.12]  50% of
[11541.12 --> 11541.72]  The team
[11541.72 --> 11542.40]  I had to
[11542.40 --> 11543.22]  Inform those
[11543.22 --> 11543.74]  Affected
[11543.74 --> 11544.70]  Despite not
[11544.70 --> 11545.32]  Making the
[11545.32 --> 11545.58]  Call
[11545.58 --> 11546.44]  Have you ever
[11546.44 --> 11547.30]  Delivered news
[11547.30 --> 11547.86]  That impacted
[11547.86 --> 11548.62]  People's lives
[11548.62 --> 11549.06]  While being
[11549.06 --> 11549.80]  Limited by
[11549.80 --> 11550.84]  HR script
[11550.84 --> 11552.66]  Oh yeah
[11552.66 --> 11554.68]  Yeah
[11554.68 --> 11555.48]  That's honestly
[11555.48 --> 11556.50]  Part of the gig
[11556.50 --> 11557.58]  That's a huge
[11557.58 --> 11558.52]  Thing like in
[11558.52 --> 11558.86]  BC
[11558.86 --> 11560.48]  If you give
[11560.48 --> 11560.92]  Someone a
[11560.92 --> 11561.86]  Reason for
[11561.86 --> 11563.40]  Parting ways
[11563.40 --> 11564.84]  They can take
[11564.84 --> 11565.42]  That reason
[11565.42 --> 11566.96]  And twist it
[11566.96 --> 11567.44]  Into
[11567.44 --> 11569.86]  A huge
[11569.86 --> 11570.40]  Variety of
[11570.40 --> 11570.54]  Different
[11570.54 --> 11570.70]  Things
[11570.70 --> 11572.78]  So the
[11572.78 --> 11573.78]  Legal advice
[11573.78 --> 11574.16]  We get
[11574.16 --> 11574.82]  Now is
[11574.82 --> 11575.06]  You just
[11575.06 --> 11575.32]  Have to
[11575.32 --> 11575.60]  Say
[11575.60 --> 11576.72]  It's not
[11576.72 --> 11577.24]  Working out
[11577.24 --> 11577.60]  We're going
[11577.60 --> 11577.80]  In a
[11577.80 --> 11577.98]  Different
[11577.98 --> 11578.38]  Direction
[11578.38 --> 11578.68]  If they
[11578.68 --> 11579.20]  Ask why
[11579.20 --> 11579.68]  You basically
[11579.68 --> 11580.12]  Just say
[11580.12 --> 11580.54]  It's not
[11580.54 --> 11580.94]  Working out
[11580.94 --> 11581.26]  We're going
[11581.26 --> 11581.44]  In a
[11581.44 --> 11581.60]  Different
[11581.60 --> 11582.00]  Direction
[11582.00 --> 11582.40]  That's like
[11582.40 --> 11582.76]  That feels
[11582.76 --> 11583.28]  So unfair
[11583.28 --> 11584.30]  To me
[11584.30 --> 11586.28]  And it's
[11586.28 --> 11586.78]  Frustrating
[11586.78 --> 11587.28]  Because
[11587.28 --> 11588.58]  You really
[11588.58 --> 11588.96]  Want to
[11588.96 --> 11589.72]  Help that
[11589.72 --> 11590.20]  Person in
[11590.20 --> 11590.32]  That
[11590.32 --> 11590.56]  Moment
[11590.56 --> 11591.88]  But you
[11591.88 --> 11592.44]  Legally
[11592.44 --> 11593.26]  Can't
[11593.26 --> 11594.70]  Or you
[11594.70 --> 11595.20]  Open yourself
[11595.20 --> 11595.56]  Up to a
[11595.56 --> 11595.80]  Bunch of
[11595.80 --> 11596.16]  Liability
[11596.16 --> 11596.78]  Which feels
[11596.78 --> 11597.06]  Kind of
[11597.06 --> 11597.56]  Ridiculous
[11597.56 --> 11597.96]  Yeah
[11597.96 --> 11598.70]  Alright
[11598.70 --> 11599.86]  Hey DLL
[11599.86 --> 11600.32]  Long time
[11600.32 --> 11600.66]  Listener
[11600.66 --> 11601.16]  First time
[11601.16 --> 11601.54]  Caller
[11601.54 --> 11602.36]  Linus
[11602.36 --> 11603.24]  Was your
[11603.24 --> 11603.84]  What was your
[11603.84 --> 11604.50]  Experience like
[11604.50 --> 11605.14]  Getting fitted
[11605.14 --> 11605.64]  For your
[11605.64 --> 11606.16]  Big screen
[11606.16 --> 11606.52]  Beyond
[11606.52 --> 11607.18]  I'm currently
[11607.18 --> 11607.74]  In the process
[11607.74 --> 11608.36]  Of getting mine
[11608.36 --> 11609.10]  Exchange for
[11609.10 --> 11609.48]  A narrower
[11609.48 --> 11610.16]  IPD
[11610.16 --> 11610.66]  They nailed
[11610.66 --> 11610.84]  It
[11610.84 --> 11611.36]  I don't
[11611.36 --> 11611.50]  Know
[11611.50 --> 11612.10]  Yeah I
[11612.10 --> 11612.32]  Guess
[11612.32 --> 11613.16]  Bad luck
[11613.16 --> 11615.44]  With seemingly
[11615.44 --> 11616.78]  More and more
[11616.78 --> 11617.20]  Govie
[11617.20 --> 11617.84]  Sponsorships
[11617.84 --> 11618.18]  Lately
[11618.18 --> 11618.82]  Would it be
[11618.82 --> 11619.32]  Possible to
[11619.32 --> 11619.94]  Persuade them
[11619.94 --> 11620.56]  To support
[11620.56 --> 11621.28]  An open
[11621.28 --> 11621.76]  API
[11621.76 --> 11622.24]  To enable
[11622.24 --> 11622.66]  Things like
[11622.66 --> 11622.94]  Home
[11622.94 --> 11623.34]  Assistant
[11623.34 --> 11623.88]  Integration
[11623.88 --> 11624.76]  I've raised
[11624.76 --> 11625.28]  This as a
[11625.28 --> 11625.70]  Concern with
[11625.70 --> 11626.04]  The business
[11626.04 --> 11626.26]  Team
[11626.26 --> 11626.54]  I think
[11626.54 --> 11626.82]  They're
[11626.82 --> 11627.22]  Bringing it
[11627.22 --> 11627.52]  To go
[11627.52 --> 11628.34]  V and
[11628.34 --> 11629.16]  Figuring out
[11629.16 --> 11629.84]  Sort of
[11629.84 --> 11631.34]  What the
[11631.34 --> 11631.80]  Sitch is
[11631.80 --> 11632.24]  Right now
[11632.24 --> 11634.06]  Love listening
[11634.06 --> 11634.48]  To y'all
[11634.48 --> 11635.10]  While working
[11635.10 --> 11635.94]  Luke what
[11635.94 --> 11636.44]  Is the
[11636.44 --> 11636.92]  Project
[11636.92 --> 11637.52]  You regret
[11637.52 --> 11638.78]  The outcome
[11638.78 --> 11639.66]  Of most
[11639.66 --> 11640.46]  Pizza
[11640.46 --> 11642.32]  Sorry
[11642.32 --> 11643.36]  My actual
[11643.36 --> 11643.90]  First thought
[11643.90 --> 11645.10]  Did go to
[11645.10 --> 11645.86]  Pizza heater
[11645.86 --> 11646.12]  Computer
[11646.12 --> 11649.08]  My first thought
[11649.08 --> 11649.52]  Did go to
[11649.52 --> 11649.90]  Pizza heater
[11649.90 --> 11650.20]  Computer
[11650.20 --> 11650.64]  But I think
[11650.64 --> 11651.00]  I'm going to
[11651.00 --> 11651.84]  Say the
[11651.84 --> 11654.22]  The post
[11654.22 --> 11654.68]  Feature
[11654.68 --> 11655.66]  On
[11655.66 --> 11656.32]  Floatplane
[11656.32 --> 11656.92]  Which is
[11656.92 --> 11657.36]  Interesting
[11657.36 --> 11659.04]  Because people
[11659.04 --> 11659.52]  Use it
[11659.52 --> 11659.94]  Now
[11659.94 --> 11662.40]  But anyway
[11662.40 --> 11662.76]  So the
[11662.76 --> 11663.42]  Post feature
[11663.42 --> 11664.44]  Basically we were
[11664.44 --> 11664.84]  Trying to do
[11664.84 --> 11665.46]  Creator recruitment
[11665.46 --> 11666.40]  And we just
[11666.40 --> 11666.92]  Had video
[11666.92 --> 11669.20]  And a bunch
[11669.20 --> 11669.66]  Of people
[11669.66 --> 11670.46]  Were like
[11670.46 --> 11671.70]  Oh you need
[11671.70 --> 11672.58]  You need audio
[11672.58 --> 11673.12]  And picture
[11673.12 --> 11674.36]  And text
[11674.36 --> 11675.64]  Or else it's
[11675.64 --> 11676.04]  Like not
[11676.04 --> 11676.44]  Everything
[11676.44 --> 11677.96]  And like
[11677.96 --> 11678.46]  We'll join
[11678.46 --> 11678.92]  Once you do
[11678.92 --> 11679.12]  That
[11679.12 --> 11679.38]  And we were
[11679.38 --> 11679.84]  Like okay
[11679.84 --> 11680.88]  So we spent
[11680.88 --> 11681.30]  Six months
[11681.30 --> 11681.78]  Doing that
[11681.78 --> 11683.06]  We did it
[11683.06 --> 11684.24]  And then
[11684.24 --> 11685.44]  Nobody cares
[11685.44 --> 11687.42]  It's just like
[11687.42 --> 11688.42]  Oh man
[11688.42 --> 11689.48]  That's that's
[11689.48 --> 11689.80]  One of the
[11689.80 --> 11690.24]  Points in time
[11690.24 --> 11690.74]  Where we shifted
[11690.74 --> 11691.34]  To like okay
[11691.34 --> 11691.70]  We're going to
[11691.70 --> 11692.32]  Make stuff for
[11692.32 --> 11692.78]  The creators
[11692.78 --> 11693.14]  That are on
[11693.14 --> 11693.64]  The platform
[11693.64 --> 11694.36]  I've personally
[11694.36 --> 11695.10]  Used posts
[11695.10 --> 11695.70]  Just so you
[11695.70 --> 11695.86]  Know
[11695.86 --> 11696.48]  Now
[11696.48 --> 11697.84]  For whatever
[11697.84 --> 11698.30]  Reason
[11698.30 --> 11699.28]  It's used
[11699.28 --> 11700.26]  Actually quite a
[11700.26 --> 11700.42]  Bit
[11700.42 --> 11700.86]  Yeah
[11700.86 --> 11701.76]  Like a lot
[11701.76 --> 11702.18]  Of the creators
[11702.18 --> 11702.56]  Use it
[11702.56 --> 11702.82]  And a lot
[11702.82 --> 11703.00]  Of people
[11703.00 --> 11703.52]  Found very
[11703.52 --> 11704.00]  Good ways
[11704.00 --> 11704.42]  To use it
[11704.42 --> 11704.78]  Stuff like
[11704.78 --> 11704.98]  That
[11704.98 --> 11705.52]  But when
[11705.52 --> 11706.08]  We first
[11706.08 --> 11706.70]  Launched it
[11706.70 --> 11707.62]  Nobody
[11707.62 --> 11708.38]  Used it
[11708.38 --> 11709.78]  It's a
[11709.78 --> 11710.62]  Workflow thing
[11710.62 --> 11711.22]  I understand
[11711.22 --> 11711.76]  Yada yada
[11711.76 --> 11712.26]  But like
[11712.26 --> 11712.62]  It's
[11712.62 --> 11713.10]  It was
[11713.10 --> 11714.12]  It was
[11714.12 --> 11714.64]  Depressing
[11714.64 --> 11715.32]  At the time
[11715.32 --> 11716.72]  But I mean
[11716.72 --> 11716.98]  Yeah
[11716.98 --> 11717.54]  I'm happy
[11717.54 --> 11717.98]  We have it
[11717.98 --> 11718.24]  Now
[11718.24 --> 11718.90]  Because it's
[11718.90 --> 11719.42]  Like actually
[11719.42 --> 11720.22]  Very commonly
[11720.22 --> 11720.52]  Used
[11720.52 --> 11721.96]  It also
[11721.96 --> 11722.40]  Allows you
[11722.40 --> 11722.62]  To have
[11722.62 --> 11723.00]  Multiple
[11723.00 --> 11723.44]  Things
[11723.44 --> 11723.78]  Per
[11723.78 --> 11724.42]  Upload
[11724.42 --> 11724.82]  So like
[11724.82 --> 11725.18]  Someone could
[11725.18 --> 11725.82]  Upload a video
[11725.82 --> 11726.94]  With individual
[11726.94 --> 11727.64]  Graph files
[11727.64 --> 11728.56]  Attached to it
[11728.56 --> 11730.74]  Yeah
[11730.74 --> 11731.16]  There's like
[11731.16 --> 11731.70]  Lots of other
[11731.70 --> 11732.02]  Stuff
[11732.02 --> 11732.80]  There was
[11732.80 --> 11733.20]  For the
[11733.20 --> 11733.98]  Behind the scenes
[11733.98 --> 11734.48]  Of the
[11734.48 --> 11734.92]  What it's like
[11734.92 --> 11735.40]  To work at
[11735.40 --> 11736.32]  LTT videos
[11736.32 --> 11737.40]  Or not
[11737.40 --> 11738.00]  Behind the scenes
[11738.00 --> 11738.30]  For the
[11738.30 --> 11739.10]  Extended cuts
[11739.10 --> 11739.64]  Of that
[11739.64 --> 11740.30]  There was like
[11740.30 --> 11741.26]  So many videos
[11741.26 --> 11741.90]  That they ended up
[11741.90 --> 11742.42]  Uploading them
[11742.42 --> 11743.18]  In clumps
[11743.18 --> 11743.80]  So that you
[11743.80 --> 11744.42]  Didn't get like
[11744.42 --> 11745.04]  10 billion
[11745.04 --> 11745.66]  Notifications
[11745.66 --> 11746.84]  It was
[11746.84 --> 11747.04]  It was good
[11747.04 --> 11752.04]  Linus
[11752.04 --> 11753.08]  What about
[11753.08 --> 11753.58]  Doing a
[11753.58 --> 11753.96]  Quarterly
[11753.96 --> 11754.16]  Or
[11754.16 --> 11754.98]  Bi-monthly
[11754.98 --> 11755.30]  Merch
[11755.30 --> 11755.80]  Update
[11755.80 --> 11756.40]  Instead
[11756.40 --> 11756.94]  Of
[11756.94 --> 11757.20]  With
[11757.20 --> 11757.50]  WAN
[11757.50 --> 11757.94]  Updates
[11757.94 --> 11758.52]  I feel
[11758.52 --> 11758.80]  Like it
[11758.80 --> 11759.04]  Would be
[11759.04 --> 11759.48]  Easier
[11759.48 --> 11759.96]  To go
[11759.96 --> 11760.22]  Much
[11760.22 --> 11760.42]  More
[11760.42 --> 11760.62]  In
[11760.62 --> 11760.94]  Depth
[11760.94 --> 11761.22]  And it
[11761.22 --> 11761.38]  Would be
[11761.38 --> 11761.58]  Easier
[11761.58 --> 11762.04]  To find
[11762.04 --> 11762.54]  Specific
[11762.54 --> 11762.98]  Updates
[11762.98 --> 11764.46]  The intention
[11764.46 --> 11765.08]  Is for
[11765.08 --> 11765.62]  That to
[11765.62 --> 11766.30]  Take place
[11766.30 --> 11767.18]  In the
[11767.18 --> 11768.26]  Creator
[11768.26 --> 11768.66]  Warehouse
[11768.66 --> 11769.14]  Newsletter
[11769.14 --> 11769.50]  At some
[11769.50 --> 11769.74]  Point
[11769.74 --> 11770.74]  We've
[11770.74 --> 11771.26]  Had a
[11771.26 --> 11771.68]  Really hard
[11771.68 --> 11772.08]  Time
[11772.08 --> 11772.58]  Just
[11772.58 --> 11773.28]  With being
[11773.28 --> 11773.52]  Busy
[11773.52 --> 11773.86]  With other
[11773.86 --> 11774.24]  Things
[11774.24 --> 11775.12]  Being on
[11775.12 --> 11775.46]  Top of
[11775.46 --> 11775.66]  That
[11775.66 --> 11776.00]  And doing
[11776.00 --> 11776.16]  Them
[11776.16 --> 11776.68]  Regularly
[11776.68 --> 11776.92]  Enough
[11776.92 --> 11777.78]  But
[11777.78 --> 11779.22]  At some
[11779.22 --> 11779.44]  Point
[11779.44 --> 11780.38]  I want
[11780.38 --> 11781.12]  That newsletter
[11781.12 --> 11781.70]  To be
[11781.70 --> 11782.40]  That content
[11782.40 --> 11783.18]  That you're
[11783.18 --> 11783.76]  Asking for
[11783.76 --> 11783.98]  Here
[11783.98 --> 11784.54]  I think
[11784.54 --> 11784.86]  We talk
[11784.86 --> 11785.08]  About
[11785.08 --> 11785.34]  Merch
[11785.34 --> 11785.54]  Enough
[11785.54 --> 11785.80]  On the
[11785.80 --> 11785.96]  Show
[11785.96 --> 11786.26]  As it
[11786.26 --> 11786.52]  Is
[11786.52 --> 11788.56]  And I
[11788.56 --> 11788.70]  Don't
[11788.70 --> 11788.96]  Think we
[11788.96 --> 11789.42]  Can avoid
[11789.42 --> 11789.92]  Talking about
[11789.92 --> 11790.18]  It every
[11790.18 --> 11790.38]  Week
[11790.38 --> 11790.86]  Because so
[11790.86 --> 11791.22]  Many people
[11791.22 --> 11791.70]  Ask us
[11791.70 --> 11792.10]  About it
[11792.10 --> 11792.92]  So I
[11792.92 --> 11793.04]  Don't
[11793.04 --> 11793.34]  Think we're
[11793.34 --> 11793.50]  Going to
[11793.50 --> 11793.86]  Move to
[11793.86 --> 11794.54]  Just consolidated
[11794.54 --> 11795.22]  Monthly
[11795.22 --> 11795.94]  Talking about
[11795.94 --> 11796.50]  Merch sessions
[11796.50 --> 11797.48]  And I
[11797.48 --> 11797.68]  Don't
[11797.68 --> 11798.42]  Think that
[11798.42 --> 11800.10]  Adding monthly
[11800.10 --> 11800.76]  To the already
[11800.76 --> 11801.28]  Weekly ones
[11801.28 --> 11801.60]  We're doing
[11801.60 --> 11801.98]  Is going to
[11801.98 --> 11802.46]  Be the way
[11802.46 --> 11802.74]  To go
[11802.74 --> 11803.10]  I think
[11803.10 --> 11803.84]  Getting that
[11803.84 --> 11804.22]  Newsletter
[11804.22 --> 11804.54]  Up and
[11804.54 --> 11804.72]  Running
[11804.72 --> 11805.48]  Is probably
[11805.48 --> 11805.86]  Our best
[11805.86 --> 11806.12]  Bet
[11806.12 --> 11807.50]  With
[11807.50 --> 11807.90]  Modern
[11807.90 --> 11808.48]  CPUs
[11808.48 --> 11808.66]  Getting
[11808.66 --> 11809.00]  Hotter
[11809.00 --> 11809.40]  And hotter
[11809.40 --> 11810.86]  At what
[11810.86 --> 11811.46]  Point is
[11811.46 --> 11811.96]  It necessary
[11811.96 --> 11812.42]  To commit
[11812.42 --> 11812.74]  To an
[11812.74 --> 11813.22]  AIO
[11813.22 --> 11813.54]  Or
[11813.54 --> 11813.84]  Water
[11813.84 --> 11814.22]  Cooler
[11814.22 --> 11815.72]  Well
[11815.72 --> 11816.06]  It's
[11816.06 --> 11816.60]  Complicated
[11816.60 --> 11816.92]  Right
[11816.92 --> 11817.88]  Today
[11817.88 --> 11818.38]  But also
[11818.38 --> 11818.70]  Never
[11818.70 --> 11821.50]  AIOs
[11821.50 --> 11821.76]  Are not
[11821.76 --> 11822.02]  Always
[11822.02 --> 11822.38]  The best
[11822.38 --> 11822.76]  Solution
[11822.76 --> 11823.56]  Like if
[11823.56 --> 11823.86]  I was
[11823.86 --> 11824.14]  Going
[11824.14 --> 11824.76]  Threadripper
[11824.76 --> 11826.02]  Do those
[11826.02 --> 11826.70]  Thermosiphon
[11826.70 --> 11827.20]  Guys still
[11827.20 --> 11827.54]  Exist
[11827.54 --> 11828.62]  Because that's
[11828.62 --> 11828.94]  What I'd
[11828.94 --> 11829.18]  Want
[11829.18 --> 11831.72]  Threadripper
[11831.72 --> 11833.34]  Yeah
[11833.34 --> 11834.94]  This thing
[11834.94 --> 11837.12]  Sick
[11837.12 --> 11838.46]  Do they
[11838.46 --> 11839.08]  Support
[11839.08 --> 11840.04]  The new
[11840.04 --> 11840.32]  Ones
[11840.32 --> 11840.60]  Though
[11840.60 --> 11843.40]  Oh
[11843.40 --> 11844.26]  No
[11844.26 --> 11846.50]  I don't
[11846.50 --> 11846.86]  See anything
[11846.86 --> 11847.20]  About the
[11847.20 --> 11847.74]  New ones
[11847.74 --> 11848.94]  Do they
[11848.94 --> 11849.66]  Have like
[11849.66 --> 11850.30]  News
[11850.30 --> 11851.16]  Media
[11851.16 --> 11852.10]  Reviews
[11852.10 --> 11852.64]  Blog
[11852.64 --> 11853.30]  Anything
[11853.30 --> 11855.14]  Okay
[11855.14 --> 11855.56]  I don't
[11855.56 --> 11856.00]  I don't
[11856.00 --> 11856.38]  Know
[11856.38 --> 11858.32]  Anyway
[11858.32 --> 11858.90]  Ice Giant
[11858.90 --> 11859.50]  Super cool
[11859.50 --> 11859.92]  Products
[11859.92 --> 11860.82]  Can I
[11860.82 --> 11861.40]  Can I
[11861.40 --> 11861.42]  Can I
[11861.42 --> 11862.28]  Buy it
[11862.28 --> 11863.20]  I can
[11863.20 --> 11863.62]  Just buy
[11863.62 --> 11863.88]  It
[11863.88 --> 11866.88]  Yeah I
[11866.88 --> 11867.12]  Think they
[11867.12 --> 11867.56]  Probably still
[11867.56 --> 11867.84]  Have some
[11867.84 --> 11868.14]  Work to
[11868.14 --> 11868.76]  Do for
[11868.76 --> 11869.28]  Mounting
[11869.28 --> 11869.64]  For the
[11869.64 --> 11869.78]  New
[11869.78 --> 11870.14]  Threadripper
[11870.14 --> 11870.54]  But I
[11870.54 --> 11871.20]  Honestly I'd
[11871.20 --> 11871.50]  Rather have
[11871.50 --> 11871.92]  Something like
[11871.92 --> 11872.46]  This than a
[11872.46 --> 11872.92]  Water cooler
[11872.92 --> 11873.44]  Just because
[11873.44 --> 11873.80]  It's fewer
[11873.80 --> 11874.18]  Points of
[11874.18 --> 11874.50]  Failure
[11874.50 --> 11876.44]  You don't
[11876.44 --> 11876.72]  Have to worry
[11876.72 --> 11877.04]  About the
[11877.04 --> 11877.52]  Pump failing
[11877.52 --> 11884.58]  So it
[11884.58 --> 11885.00]  Says there's
[11885.00 --> 11885.68]  16 left
[11885.68 --> 11886.42]  But that
[11886.42 --> 11886.80]  Number hasn't
[11886.80 --> 11887.06]  Been going
[11887.06 --> 11888.16]  Down and
[11888.16 --> 11888.66]  There's none
[11888.66 --> 11889.00]  In there
[11889.00 --> 11889.88]  Oh okay I
[11889.88 --> 11890.06]  See
[11890.06 --> 11891.54]  There's one
[11891.54 --> 11891.98]  In incoming
[11891.98 --> 11892.52]  I don't
[11892.52 --> 11893.42]  Think I have
[11893.42 --> 11893.88]  An answer for
[11893.88 --> 11894.38]  This one Thor
[11894.38 --> 11894.88]  I can't think
[11894.88 --> 11895.32]  Of a feature
[11895.32 --> 11895.74]  In a game
[11895.74 --> 11896.06]  That was
[11896.06 --> 11896.86]  Removed
[11896.86 --> 11897.56]  After the
[11897.56 --> 11897.92]  Game got
[11897.92 --> 11898.34]  An update
[11898.34 --> 11898.74]  That has
[11898.74 --> 11899.30]  Bothered me
[11899.30 --> 11899.54]  Luke
[11899.54 --> 11899.96]  Can you
[11899.96 --> 11900.18]  Think of
[11900.18 --> 11900.64]  A feature
[11900.64 --> 11901.68]  In a game
[11901.68 --> 11901.96]  That was
[11901.96 --> 11902.20]  I've been
[11902.20 --> 11902.54]  Trying to
[11902.54 --> 11902.98]  Think about
[11902.98 --> 11903.20]  This
[11903.20 --> 11903.86]  Not really
[11903.86 --> 11904.38]  To be
[11904.38 --> 11904.74]  Honest
[11904.74 --> 11906.56]  I know
[11906.56 --> 11907.00]  This is a
[11907.00 --> 11907.40]  Thing but
[11907.40 --> 11907.62]  It's not
[11907.62 --> 11908.00]  Something that
[11908.00 --> 11908.30]  I've like
[11908.30 --> 11908.76]  Tracked
[11908.76 --> 11910.48]  Like nerfing
[11910.48 --> 11911.08]  Weapons and
[11911.08 --> 11911.50]  Stuff like
[11911.50 --> 11912.02]  That you know
[11912.02 --> 11912.94]  Obviously you
[11912.94 --> 11913.14]  Know that
[11913.14 --> 11913.66]  Kind of sucks
[11913.66 --> 11914.28]  If that
[11914.28 --> 11914.68]  You're into
[11914.68 --> 11915.24]  That meta
[11915.24 --> 11916.00]  Yeah but
[11916.00 --> 11916.38]  It's not a
[11916.38 --> 11916.88]  Feature
[11916.88 --> 11917.40]  No it's not
[11917.40 --> 11917.92]  A feature
[11917.92 --> 11918.88]  Something that
[11918.88 --> 11919.42]  I've complained
[11919.42 --> 11920.12]  About recently
[11920.12 --> 11920.72]  Was battle
[11920.72 --> 11921.62]  Bit had a
[11921.62 --> 11923.06]  Map and
[11923.06 --> 11923.74]  Mode voting
[11923.74 --> 11924.86]  System and
[11924.86 --> 11925.14]  They just
[11925.14 --> 11925.64]  Turned it into
[11925.64 --> 11926.24]  Like a random
[11926.24 --> 11927.00]  Slot machine
[11927.00 --> 11927.70]  Instead of
[11927.70 --> 11928.04]  Voting
[11928.04 --> 11929.08]  Okay well I
[11929.08 --> 11929.56]  Think that's a
[11929.56 --> 11930.02]  Great example
[11930.02 --> 11930.48]  But then they
[11930.48 --> 11931.32]  Brought it back
[11931.32 --> 11931.96]  Okay but
[11931.96 --> 11932.86]  But you were
[11932.86 --> 11933.54]  But yes
[11933.54 --> 11934.38]  Yeah I think
[11934.38 --> 11934.96]  That's the best
[11934.96 --> 11935.36]  One that I
[11935.36 --> 11935.56]  Got
[11935.56 --> 11936.26]  Yeah I mean
[11936.26 --> 11936.74]  This didn't
[11936.74 --> 11937.30]  This wasn't
[11937.30 --> 11938.00]  Removed from
[11938.00 --> 11938.60]  Halo Infinite
[11938.60 --> 11939.32]  Because it was
[11939.32 --> 11939.98]  Always stupid
[11939.98 --> 11940.66]  Like this but
[11940.66 --> 11941.18]  Not being able
[11941.18 --> 11941.76]  To select what
[11941.76 --> 11942.28]  Game mode you
[11942.28 --> 11942.72]  Want to play
[11942.72 --> 11943.64]  Yeah not being
[11943.64 --> 11943.96]  Able to say
[11943.96 --> 11944.26]  Yeah I just
[11944.26 --> 11944.56]  Want to play
[11944.56 --> 11944.96]  Capture the
[11944.96 --> 11945.50]  Flag tonight
[11945.50 --> 11946.74]  That was
[11946.74 --> 11948.08]  Removed compared
[11948.08 --> 11949.08]  To how it
[11949.08 --> 11949.98]  Should work but
[11949.98 --> 11950.46]  It was always
[11950.46 --> 11951.14]  Like that which
[11951.14 --> 11952.10]  Is ridiculous
[11952.10 --> 11953.54]  And I think
[11953.54 --> 11954.42]  That's pretty
[11954.42 --> 11956.86]  Much it for
[11956.86 --> 11957.30]  Tonight
[11957.30 --> 11959.48]  Oh update on
[11959.48 --> 11959.96]  The rain cover
[11959.96 --> 11960.50]  For the backpack
[11960.50 --> 11961.46]  Asks Bryce
[11961.46 --> 11961.92]  B
[11961.92 --> 11963.86]  Okay
[11963.86 --> 11965.74]  We've got
[11965.74 --> 11966.24]  Our sample
[11966.24 --> 11966.88]  Of something
[11966.88 --> 11967.88]  That I'm
[11967.88 --> 11968.32]  Ready to
[11968.32 --> 11968.90]  Press go
[11968.90 --> 11970.18]  On except
[11970.18 --> 11970.80]  The pricing
[11970.80 --> 11971.22]  Is a big
[11971.22 --> 11972.26]  Problem and
[11972.26 --> 11972.68]  The pricing
[11972.68 --> 11973.38]  Is my fault
[11973.38 --> 11974.98]  Because I
[11974.98 --> 11975.42]  Wanted the
[11975.42 --> 11976.42]  Rain fly to
[11976.42 --> 11976.88]  Turn the
[11976.88 --> 11977.60]  Backpack
[11977.60 --> 11979.26]  Reflective
[11979.26 --> 11980.98]  Because anytime
[11980.98 --> 11981.76]  There's rain
[11981.76 --> 11982.76]  There can be
[11982.76 --> 11983.24]  Visibility
[11983.24 --> 11983.78]  Challenges
[11983.78 --> 11984.92]  That's a big
[11984.92 --> 11985.32]  Benefit
[11985.32 --> 11986.00]  And I really
[11986.00 --> 11986.84]  Wanted the bag
[11986.84 --> 11988.24]  To be black
[11988.24 --> 11988.68]  To match
[11988.68 --> 11989.18]  Our look
[11989.18 --> 11989.86]  But also
[11989.86 --> 11990.26]  Be high
[11990.26 --> 11990.56]  Vis
[11990.56 --> 11991.22]  So we've
[11991.22 --> 11991.54]  Got this
[11991.54 --> 11992.32]  Really cool
[11992.32 --> 11992.88]  Graphic
[11992.88 --> 11993.42]  That is a
[11993.42 --> 11994.08]  Collaboration
[11994.08 --> 11994.54]  Between
[11994.54 --> 11995.88]  It's sort of
[11995.88 --> 11996.30]  Based on
[11996.30 --> 11996.58]  Some of
[11996.58 --> 11997.12]  Lloyd's artwork
[11997.12 --> 11997.70]  But then
[11997.70 --> 11997.98]  It was
[11997.98 --> 11998.80]  Adapted by
[11998.80 --> 11999.46]  A relatively
[11999.46 --> 11999.98]  New member
[11999.98 --> 12000.46]  Of our
[12000.46 --> 12000.72]  Creative
[12000.72 --> 12001.00]  Warehouse
[12001.00 --> 12001.24]  Team
[12001.24 --> 12001.58]  Lisa
[12001.58 --> 12003.40]  And it's
[12003.40 --> 12003.84]  Like kind
[12003.84 --> 12004.64]  Of mountains
[12004.64 --> 12005.56]  And like
[12005.56 --> 12006.42]  I don't know
[12006.42 --> 12007.08]  Constellations
[12007.08 --> 12007.38]  And stuff
[12007.38 --> 12007.62]  It's like
[12007.62 --> 12008.24]  Super cool
[12008.24 --> 12009.08]  And then
[12009.08 --> 12009.62]  In the initial
[12009.62 --> 12010.16]  Meeting about
[12010.16 --> 12010.52]  It I was
[12010.52 --> 12011.28]  Like oh man
[12011.28 --> 12012.22]  How cool
[12012.22 --> 12012.82]  Would it be
[12012.82 --> 12013.36]  Because we
[12013.36 --> 12013.62]  Had two
[12013.62 --> 12014.24]  Different options
[12014.24 --> 12014.54]  For the
[12014.54 --> 12014.92]  Reflective
[12014.92 --> 12015.22]  Material
[12015.22 --> 12015.54]  We had
[12015.54 --> 12015.82]  The kind
[12015.82 --> 12016.08]  Of like
[12016.08 --> 12016.60]  Gray
[12016.60 --> 12017.34]  High vis
[12017.34 --> 12017.56]  One
[12017.56 --> 12018.02]  And then
[12018.02 --> 12018.20]  You know
[12018.20 --> 12018.50]  That like
[12018.50 --> 12018.90]  Rainbow
[12018.90 --> 12019.44]  Reflective
[12019.44 --> 12019.80]  Material
[12019.80 --> 12021.04]  Okay
[12021.04 --> 12021.68]  So we
[12021.68 --> 12022.00]  Ordered
[12022.00 --> 12022.08]  So this
[12022.08 --> 12022.30]  Is going
[12022.30 --> 12022.54]  To look
[12022.54 --> 12023.00]  Sick
[12023.00 --> 12023.36]  So we
[12023.36 --> 12023.66]  Ordered
[12023.66 --> 12024.20]  Samples
[12024.20 --> 12025.00]  With the
[12025.00 --> 12025.68]  Just like
[12025.68 --> 12026.02]  The gray
[12026.02 --> 12026.32]  One
[12026.32 --> 12027.06]  And with
[12027.06 --> 12027.40]  The rainbow
[12027.40 --> 12027.70]  One
[12027.70 --> 12027.90]  And I
[12027.90 --> 12028.10]  Was like
[12028.10 --> 12028.40]  Oh you
[12028.40 --> 12028.52]  Know it
[12031.58 --> 12034.94]  That one's
[12034.94 --> 12035.14]  Going to be
[12035.14 --> 12036.16]  Like 60
[12036.16 --> 12036.68]  Or 70
[12036.68 --> 12037.20]  Dollars
[12037.20 --> 12038.40]  Because it's
[12038.40 --> 12038.78]  Now a
[12038.78 --> 12039.48]  Multi-stage
[12039.48 --> 12040.00]  Process
[12040.00 --> 12040.46]  But it
[12040.46 --> 12040.68]  Sounds
[12040.68 --> 12041.10]  Actually
[12041.10 --> 12041.50]  Amazing
[12041.50 --> 12041.96]  But it's
[12041.96 --> 12042.12]  Going to
[12042.12 --> 12042.72]  Look amazing
[12042.72 --> 12043.80]  So we're
[12043.80 --> 12044.62]  Trying to
[12044.62 --> 12045.04]  Figure out
[12045.04 --> 12045.38]  What to
[12045.38 --> 12046.00]  Do we
[12046.00 --> 12046.70]  Do we
[12046.70 --> 12047.28]  Go forward
[12047.28 --> 12047.66]  With it
[12047.66 --> 12047.96]  And just
[12047.96 --> 12048.48]  Have like
[12048.48 --> 12049.44]  The world's
[12049.44 --> 12050.10]  Most expensive
[12050.10 --> 12050.76]  Rainfly
[12050.76 --> 12051.84]  Or
[12051.84 --> 12053.02]  Do we
[12053.02 --> 12053.04]  Do we
[12053.04 --> 12054.12]  Do we
[12054.12 --> 12054.44]  Do the
[12054.44 --> 12055.26]  Same thing
[12055.26 --> 12056.50]  And just
[12056.50 --> 12057.10]  Have one
[12057.10 --> 12057.50]  Color
[12057.50 --> 12058.10]  And have
[12058.10 --> 12058.28]  It be
[12058.28 --> 12058.46]  Way
[12058.46 --> 12058.72]  Cheaper
[12058.72 --> 12058.86]  Do you
[12058.86 --> 12059.02]  Know what
[12059.02 --> 12059.40]  The difference
[12059.40 --> 12059.72]  Would be
[12059.72 --> 12060.16]  I don't
[12060.16 --> 12060.50]  Remember
[12060.50 --> 12060.94]  Exactly
[12060.94 --> 12061.22]  But it's
[12061.22 --> 12061.40]  A lot
[12061.40 --> 12062.18]  It's
[12062.18 --> 12062.42]  It's
[12062.42 --> 12062.94]  More than
[12062.94 --> 12063.28]  You'd
[12063.28 --> 12063.56]  Think
[12063.56 --> 12064.68]  Because
[12064.68 --> 12065.42]  It
[12065.42 --> 12065.90]  Takes
[12065.90 --> 12066.16]  This
[12066.16 --> 12066.48]  Like
[12066.48 --> 12067.64]  One
[12067.64 --> 12068.00]  Stage
[12068.00 --> 12068.28]  Thing
[12068.28 --> 12068.56]  And it
[12068.56 --> 12068.76]  Turns
[12068.76 --> 12068.88]  It
[12068.88 --> 12069.04]  Into
[12069.04 --> 12069.34]  Like a
[12069.34 --> 12070.00]  Multi-stage
[12070.00 --> 12070.52]  Thing
[12070.52 --> 12070.96]  Yeah
[12070.96 --> 12071.68]  It like
[12071.68 --> 12072.26]  It kind
[12072.26 --> 12072.38]  Of
[12072.38 --> 12073.08]  Up the
[12073.08 --> 12073.58]  The
[12073.58 --> 12074.36]  The
[12074.36 --> 12074.70]  Process
[12074.70 --> 12075.14]  Yeah
[12075.14 --> 12075.34]  Yeah
[12075.34 --> 12075.60]  Yeah
[12075.60 --> 12076.52]  So
[12076.52 --> 12077.58]  I love
[12077.58 --> 12078.16]  The idea
[12078.16 --> 12079.82]  Of the
[12079.82 --> 12080.04]  Two
[12080.04 --> 12080.30]  Mode
[12080.30 --> 12080.70]  Yeah
[12080.70 --> 12081.40]  That is a
[12081.40 --> 12081.78]  Little expensive
[12081.78 --> 12082.24]  Yeah
[12082.24 --> 12082.68]  That's
[12082.68 --> 12082.92]  It's
[12082.92 --> 12083.28]  Very
[12083.28 --> 12083.60]  Expensive
[12083.60 --> 12084.06]  I guarantee
[12084.06 --> 12084.24]  You
[12084.24 --> 12084.54]  Some people
[12084.54 --> 12084.84]  Would buy
[12084.84 --> 12085.00]  It
[12085.00 --> 12085.22]  But
[12085.22 --> 12085.86]  See
[12085.86 --> 12086.16]  I don't
[12086.16 --> 12086.36]  Want to
[12086.36 --> 12086.64]  Just do
[12086.64 --> 12087.10]  The rainbow
[12087.10 --> 12087.40]  Guys
[12087.40 --> 12087.78]  Because
[12087.78 --> 12088.40]  The viz
[12088.40 --> 12088.86]  Is not
[12088.86 --> 12089.80]  As high
[12089.80 --> 12090.14]  And
[12090.14 --> 12091.92]  Functionality
[12091.92 --> 12092.24]  First
[12092.24 --> 12092.86]  It's like
[12092.86 --> 12093.46]  Safety first
[12093.46 --> 12093.74]  No but
[12093.74 --> 12094.06]  Like for
[12094.06 --> 12094.30]  Real
[12094.30 --> 12096.56]  Alright
[12096.56 --> 12097.00]  Anyway
[12097.00 --> 12097.86]  I think
[12097.86 --> 12098.26]  That's it
[12098.26 --> 12099.56]  Thanks for
