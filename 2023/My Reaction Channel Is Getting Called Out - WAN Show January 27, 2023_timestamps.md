2:18 I tend to do both a lot of the time which is why I really like the timed common feature.

Speaking of which what determines that is the number of comments using timestamps?

Because I once left 1 or 2 comments on a video, clicked off for some reason and when I came back later, It had timed comments.

Or is it something else like the amount of views on a video... Which wouldn't make much sense but 🤷🏾‍♂️

What was the result of 2 weeks ago "demonetize this" episode? Did Linus talk about it? I've watched the 2 episodes since and didn't pick up on anything. Did I miss it? Does anyone know? I really don't wanna watch through 6+ hours of wan show again just to see if it was mentioned. I've looked through the timestamps

So I just came to the comments to look for NoKi1119 faithful timestamps, but it's nice to see everyone else took umbrage with linus' response to darkviperau, AND to see linus address it as well both in the pinned comment and hopefully next week. But I feel there is a far bigger fundamental problem here. If you literally do not have the time to watch a video under 30 minutes, especially at say 1.5 to 2 times speed to save yourself time, that is about YOU, then you shouldn't have time to respond to it either personally speaking. I understand linus is running a company and a half, and is very busy, but it is just disrespectful to ask someone else to summarize it for you, or only look at the comments to figure out what's in the video, instead of watching said video about you and what you are doing. The response was 10 minutes longer than the actual video was for pete's sake. 
Livestreams that are many hours long that have only a segment about you is a whole other can of worms, I understand wanting that summed up, but this instance was something one could power through and simply listen to while doing work I feel. 

I appreciate that linus eventually watched it himself, but because of the way it was done, it's now taking even more time to address than simply having watched it in the first place on top of some perceived ill will (which linus even mentioned at some points in his response and ended up being a self fulfilling prophecy). I just feel going forward, watch those videos that people put time in to specifically critique you before you respond back is all I'm saying.

At Timestamp 30:40, the video Linus is referring to for "Early Benchmarks" is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ30QIetdkk or v equals iJ30Qletdkk after the standard youtube watch url's question mark for those that don't see the link.
