[0.00 → 6.56] What is up everyone? Welcome to the WAN show. It is perfect to see you.
[6.88 → 8.54] Yeah. It's been a while.
[8.96 → 13.40] This is the latest WAN show of all time. The Streak, fortunately, is still alive.
[14.72 → 18.70] But we are officially 173 hours late, is it Dan?
[19.60 → 20.66] Yeah, that's about right.
[20.76 → 24.92] And for that, I am truly sorry. We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[25.92 → 29.88] Disney is not going to be selling DVDs in Australia anymore.
[30.32 → 37.94] Physical media is actually dying, ironically, in one of the places that needs it more than anywhere else with the state of the internet.
[38.52 → 41.54] Also, I freaking called it.
[41.58 → 42.24] For years, too.
[42.32 → 48.18] For years, I have been saying child influencers are going to sue their parents. It's happening.
[48.44 → 49.34] What else we got today?
[49.34 → 51.84] I don't know. I don't know.
[52.16 → 56.52] GTA 6 leak conducted by a teenager with an Amazon Fire Stick.
[56.66 → 58.64] That makes no sense to me. That'll be an interesting topic.
[58.64 → 60.24] What are you even saying?
[60.26 → 61.34] I don't know.
[64.04 → 65.64] Meta blocks Canadian news?
[66.06 → 66.50] Yeah.
[67.58 → 68.60] And satire.
[69.34 → 69.70] Really?
[70.14 → 70.42] Yeah.
[70.48 → 71.40] Okay, that I didn't know.
[71.50 → 74.06] I heard about this. It's like the Beaverton or something got blocked, I think.
[74.46 → 74.90] Bizarre.
[75.06 → 75.74] Yeah. Anyway.
[75.74 → 75.82] Anyway.
[75.82 → 104.48] Oh, right. There's no logo. The show is brought to you today by brand. Sorry about that. We'll be talking a little bit more about that later.
[104.48 → 106.02] I was going to say, I thought there was one.
[106.42 → 108.32] Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Brand sponsored the show today.
[108.50 → 108.78] All right.
[108.82 → 113.70] All right. Let's go ahead and jump right into our... What is our headline topic?
[114.04 → 114.48] Disney...
[114.94 → 116.48] Oh, no. Right. The headline topic is...
[118.14 → 120.06] One of the shows of all time.
[120.06 → 122.06] So, um...
[123.18 → 125.98] How weird was it not doing Sancho last week?
[125.98 → 127.84] Very weird. Very weird. Yeah.
[128.34 → 133.26] Like, actually threw me off in, like, a lot of weird ways.
[133.56 → 138.80] Like, I woke up on Saturday freaking out, thinking that I was, like, late for work. Literally.
[139.60 → 139.98] Right.
[139.98 → 144.90] Because my brain was, like, I didn't do Sancho last night. Therefore, it is not Saturday.
[145.04 → 145.46] Therefore, the week is not over.
[145.54 → 145.74] Yeah.
[148.04 → 152.22] I just wasn't really sure what to do with myself.
[152.66 → 152.68] Yeah.
[152.68 → 152.86] Yeah.
[153.36 → 158.52] I mean, I'll tell you guys. One thing wasn't weird about it, and that was that Luke and I hung out.
[158.76 → 159.38] So we...
[159.38 → 159.56] Yeah.
[159.84 → 161.32] We did private Sancho.
[161.68 → 163.86] We didn't talk about tech really much, I don't think.
[163.86 → 163.92] No.
[164.40 → 167.82] Yeah, we had the SO's, and they don't care.
[167.88 → 168.88] They're not going to be very interested in that.
[168.88 → 171.88] Yeah, they were... They're super not interested in that. So...
[171.88 → 175.74] I haven't talked tech with you in two weeks.
[175.98 → 176.20] Yeah.
[177.32 → 177.54] Yeah.
[177.72 → 178.22] What did...
[178.22 → 184.04] And all the work conversations have been, like, process and protocol, and how are we going to do this other thing, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[184.28 → 191.52] It's funny how a week of introspection has ended up being one of the most intense work weeks in my memory.
[191.94 → 193.04] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[193.04 → 193.52] Absolutely.
[193.52 → 203.12] How exactly did that happen, that we're supposed to slow down and figure it out? But it turns out, figuring things out is a freaking ton of work.
[203.26 → 203.62] Oh, yeah.
[204.38 → 204.86] There's...
[204.86 → 210.02] And there's a lot of, like, conversations you've been delaying for a while because they're difficult, but, like, now's the time.
[210.04 → 211.06] Or they're time-consuming.
[211.26 → 211.66] That, too.
[211.66 → 217.36] Or there's a lot of people that you need to try and get in the same room, and everyone's got a busy schedule.
[217.68 → 217.80] Yep.
[218.24 → 219.22] Yeah, it was...
[219.22 → 221.30] It felt perfect.
[222.74 → 224.08] Missing Sancho, not.
[224.30 → 226.32] That's actually not what I'm talking about anymore.
[226.44 → 226.78] That kind of sucked.
[226.86 → 227.60] But it was the right move.
[228.18 → 229.38] Yeah, it was the right thing to do.
[229.38 → 230.60] I mean, I think that...
[230.60 → 233.60] I want to give a shout-out to our community manager, Steven.
[234.38 → 234.78] Absolutely.
[234.78 → 250.32] He had the sage idea of asking the Float plane community, hey, do you guys want to see the exclusive content that, realistically, we already edited and already uploaded?
[250.50 → 252.30] We're just waiting to hit go.
[252.78 → 254.22] Do you want to see Sancho?
[254.38 → 255.14] Do you...
[255.14 → 256.74] How do you guys want this to work?
[256.82 → 258.42] Yeah, what do you want to happen here?
[258.52 → 263.58] Because, realistically, I mean, I think I already made it pretty clear.
[263.58 → 265.60] I was going to hang out with Luke on Friday night anyway.
[267.68 → 268.08] So...
[268.08 → 268.40] Yeah.
[268.86 → 271.26] It really doesn't make a difference to me.
[271.44 → 277.12] I really don't think it makes a difference to Luke if we do Sancho with a camera pointed at us or if we do it without a camera pointed at us.
[277.90 → 278.14] But...
[278.14 → 278.76] Dan was down.
[279.06 → 279.34] Yeah.
[279.80 → 289.62] So, I want to shout out Steven because I think the biggest takeaway from all of this is that, at the end of the day, the community is the boss.
[289.62 → 291.18] And...
[291.18 → 293.62] Whatever they say goes.
[293.74 → 296.20] And he kind of went, okay, look, you guys decide.
[296.50 → 297.00] Do you want it?
[297.04 → 297.44] Do you want it?
[297.50 → 298.18] Do you not want it?
[298.30 → 299.02] And...
[299.02 → 303.06] I think the majority actually said, go ahead.
[304.60 → 306.56] I'm not looking at the poll results right now.
[306.60 → 309.06] If I remember correctly, that's true, but it wasn't by a huge amount.
[309.06 → 323.28] But about 40%, if I recall correctly, said, hey guys, we actually just want you to put your heads down, figure out what exactly it is that you're going to come back to us with, and let's go from there.
[323.48 → 326.96] And I'm glad we did it.
[327.26 → 327.36] Yeah.
[327.74 → 328.98] I'm really glad we did it.
[329.08 → 333.14] I don't know if you guys have been keeping track, but it actually ended up being more than a week.
[333.14 → 335.14] We didn't get back to...
[335.90 → 343.66] I can't speak for every team, but on the writing side, we didn't really get back to working on videos until late yesterday, early today.
[343.78 → 346.00] So it was more than a week.
[346.52 → 348.14] And we also just...
[348.84 → 355.72] To make it so that people weren't being interrupted, so that their schedules were free to do everything they needed to do.
[355.72 → 360.72] Yeah, we didn't post even LTT videos, short circuit videos that have been ready to go.
[362.60 → 363.00] Brand.
[365.34 → 366.34] Brand's response.
[366.50 → 375.14] So I already mentioned that they're the sponsor for the WAN show today, and they're actually going to be the first sponsor that's back on short circuit.
[375.98 → 384.60] I think their take was probably one of the most level-headed and yet completely Brand takes on the whole thing.
[384.60 → 386.12] Did you see their tweet chain?
[386.70 → 386.84] Yes.
[386.84 → 387.34] Their tweet thread?
[387.62 → 387.78] Yeah.
[388.90 → 396.04] I saw a lot of people speculating that that box of broken glass is some kind of prop.
[398.36 → 402.74] They sent me a box of broken glass.
[403.84 → 405.32] I actually didn't know that.
[405.42 → 407.50] That happened before any of this.
[407.92 → 410.18] I have already filmed that video.
[410.18 → 412.18] So they basically...
[412.92 → 418.58] Either they are clairvoyant, or they just are the luckiest SOB son the face of the earth.
[418.72 → 422.20] But they had that one in the chamber, ready to go.
[422.58 → 425.16] If you want to see Linus punished, we got you.
[425.16 → 438.38] It's actually their firing back for the secret shopper thing.
[438.92 → 445.46] Because we told them we had broken glass, so you should send us a new one.
[445.52 → 448.94] And the way we broke the glass was obviously user error.
[448.94 → 450.78] But they did send it anyway.
[450.92 → 452.10] Like massive shout out Brand.
[452.26 → 455.52] They performed really well in secret shopping, our sponsors.
[456.28 → 459.66] And so they were basically like, okay, so you like broken glass, do you?
[460.30 → 464.64] So they sponsored the short circuit on the Galaxy Z Fold 5.
[465.10 → 471.08] There are actually a couple of things about that video that have aged since I recorded it.
[471.08 → 475.64] First, there's the Brand spot, which has aged like fine wine.
[476.38 → 483.08] And second of all, I say in the video that realistically, my expectation is that...
[484.00 → 493.54] The only job this phone has is to make me feel like it's worth the effort of switching all of my stuff over from my Fold 3.
[495.26 → 499.32] Well, it doesn't even have that job anymore because my phone is dead.
[501.08 → 502.78] Do you want to know how?
[503.98 → 504.78] Broken glass?
[505.08 → 505.28] No.
[505.28 → 506.36] It'd be pretty funny if it was.
[506.46 → 507.78] No, it's not, unfortunately.
[508.26 → 508.34] No.
[509.42 → 512.20] My pool has claimed its first victim.
[513.56 → 513.92] I was...
[513.92 → 514.46] Did you drop it?
[514.48 → 515.72] Did you jump in or did you drop it?
[515.74 → 516.76] I was running around.
[517.08 → 517.88] I was getting...
[517.88 → 519.08] Yeah, I know.
[519.18 → 520.02] I was running around.
[520.18 → 520.76] I was getting...
[520.76 → 520.96] Okay.
[521.12 → 522.94] And it's going to be even dumber than you think.
[523.54 → 524.98] It's way worse than you think.
[525.00 → 525.66] I promise you.
[525.84 → 528.16] I was running around getting ready for a pool party.
[528.16 → 534.70] And so I'm grabbing hoses and vacuuming the bottom and skimming and doing all that stupid stuff.
[535.72 → 545.80] As I'm walking, my arm moves and knocks my AirPods out of that little pocket, the little one right here.
[545.98 → 546.14] Yeah.
[546.30 → 548.46] Like it was not in all the way and I kind of went...
[548.46 → 554.84] And it just fell down and one of my earphones went into the water.
[554.84 → 556.42] And I went, oh, crap.
[558.08 → 559.10] It was in the shallow end.
[559.18 → 561.22] So I was like, okay, I can probably just...
[561.22 → 562.66] I probably don't have to get all the way in.
[562.72 → 566.72] I can get this, and I'll just take my shirt off after.
[566.88 → 574.42] So I laid down on the pool deck and I like blew hard out of my nose so that water wouldn't go up my nose.
[574.46 → 576.94] And I just like laid on the side and tried to reach it.
[576.98 → 577.76] Well, I didn't get it.
[577.80 → 580.78] It moved, obviously, because you're like fishing around in the water.
[580.86 → 581.70] So I'm like, okay, screw it.
[581.70 → 584.74] And I just go in, I grab it, I jump out.
[585.54 → 586.48] Obviously, it doesn't work.
[586.56 → 589.32] So I put it out in the sun and leave it there for now.
[591.24 → 591.94] And that's it.
[592.26 → 593.22] That's the end of the story.
[593.22 → 602.64] I never took my phone out of my pocket in my soggy pants that I didn't change because I was running around getting ready for the party.
[602.86 → 611.12] So I didn't realize that it had been sitting there in a soggy pocket on a hot day for probably a couple of hours.
[611.12 → 616.66] And I now speak from personal experience.
[616.66 → 626.80] If there's anything that would be worse than having your phone submerged in water, it would be having your phone in a super high humidity environment right after it got submerged in water.
[626.80 → 630.76] When I took it out of my pocket, the camera lens was fogged.
[631.04 → 631.44] Oh.
[631.44 → 633.50] Which is never a good sign.
[633.50 → 634.28] Yeah, that's not good.
[634.44 → 636.62] So I'm kind of feeling like maybe it's a video.
[638.04 → 641.10] Just like, can I, can I, the good news is I backed up.
[641.12 → 641.90] Can I save this phone?
[642.04 → 644.28] Yeah, I backed up everything like three weeks before it happened.
[644.42 → 644.62] Nice.
[644.62 → 647.48] So I lost like a couple pictures.
[647.74 → 651.96] It's, it's, there were no significant family moments or anything like that.
[652.14 → 654.20] Someone said chlorine water is probably the killer.
[654.32 → 656.20] So is it, is yours salt and chlorine?
[656.50 → 658.44] Well, it's salt chlorination.
[658.44 → 677.66] So it's like they put salt in and then there's some, this is one of those things where enough people have asked me about it that I really need to just spend 45 minutes, read the Wikipedia on salt chlorination and be like, yeah, yeah, there's, there's a, a chlorination cell in it, something, something, electricity, something.
[677.66 → 688.48] But basically it converts some kind of salt that you dump into it into chlorine, and it's supposed to be a little bit less like chlorine smelly and chlorine feely.
[689.08 → 690.30] But yeah, that's the kind.
[691.10 → 693.04] So yeah, it's, it's still chlorine.
[693.22 → 698.02] It's still producing chlorine, but it's doing it constantly instead of you just like dumping chlorine into it.
[698.06 → 698.46] No pucks.
[698.92 → 699.52] No pucks.
[699.66 → 699.98] Yeah.
[701.50 → 701.94] Yeah.
[702.00 → 703.34] The chlorine probably didn't help now.
[703.70 → 705.48] It does turn on.
[705.54 → 706.60] I can see a Samsung logo.
[706.60 → 715.16] But what I suspect is that the battery is dead because it was powered on the whole time that it was sitting there soggy.
[715.30 → 717.32] So it's probably a power connection that's corroded.
[717.94 → 723.82] Fortunately, Dan, thank you, Dan.
[724.16 → 724.72] Very helpful.
[725.28 → 728.50] Fortunately, Dan is pretty good with that kind of stuff.
[728.70 → 731.98] And Luke has already given me the go ahead to have Dan help me with that project.
[731.98 → 737.02] So if we just get like a replacement screen, replacement battery, I don't know.
[737.10 → 739.94] Maybe I fix it has like a, I legitimately don't know.
[739.98 → 744.94] They might have like a fold three refurbished kit or like screen replacement kit or something like that.
[744.94 → 750.14] And we can open it up, have a look at it, put it back together and see if I can see if I can get a few things off of it.
[750.42 → 756.72] It's the kind of thing that I'm not going to, that I'm not going to bother to, you know, send to a drive data recovery company or anything like that.
[756.72 → 758.10] It's not worth it.
[758.22 → 761.84] They want like two grand, three grand, five grand, depending on the complexity of the issue.
[761.84 → 763.42] Can we recover this at home is fun.
[764.02 → 764.34] Yeah.
[764.52 → 764.86] Why not?
[764.98 → 765.24] Yeah.
[765.40 → 765.54] Yeah.
[765.60 → 766.16] It's content.
[766.36 → 766.78] It's content.
[767.32 → 767.44] Yeah.
[767.60 → 768.06] It's content.
[768.80 → 768.92] Yeah.
[769.00 → 769.92] So I'll have some fun with that.
[769.92 → 771.06] Remember baking your Boxes?
[771.84 → 772.64] That worked.
[772.94 → 773.38] I mean.
[773.58 → 774.74] You can do some stuff at home.
[775.06 → 775.42] Yeah.
[775.54 → 777.90] Well, I mean, it's a very temporary fix, sir.
[780.26 → 782.14] Hey, maybe someone just needs to back it up.
[783.04 → 783.36] You know?
[784.08 → 785.30] Can I turn it on for a while?
[785.34 → 785.86] You know what?
[785.86 → 787.02] This is a perfect point.
[787.66 → 788.92] Androids only have this problem.
[789.02 → 790.00] iPhone backs up instantly.
[790.22 → 791.48] It's not quite that simple.
[791.64 → 798.24] But something that did happen is I hadn't opened the Google Photos app since the last time I booted the phone.
[799.08 → 803.60] And so, yeah, even though I have cloud backup configured, it didn't back up those few weeks.
[803.60 → 806.00] So I don't even have the lower quality version that would be in Google Photos.
[806.00 → 807.08] It doesn't back up a camera rule?
[808.84 → 810.60] So I don't have a Pixel.
[811.44 → 811.84] Oh.
[812.32 → 812.98] I'm on Samsung.
[812.98 → 816.48] So I typically just use Samsung's gallery app because I don't know.
[816.54 → 816.90] I don't care.
[817.34 → 819.02] Well, it turns out I should know and care.
[819.14 → 819.70] Now you do care.
[819.80 → 820.32] Yeah, exactly.
[820.42 → 822.44] Maybe I'll just use photos from now on.
[822.86 → 828.88] Especially because I use my work account as my primary account because I own the domain.
[828.88 → 832.50] So I don't have any concerns about my work account going away anytime soon.
[832.50 → 846.76] So I have, because of all of our Google Workspaces accounts and how all the storage is pooled, I have like 600 terabytes or 650 terabytes of total storage available.
[847.02 → 853.78] So I could never take enough pictures from now until the end of my life to fill up all of it.
[854.84 → 855.74] That's pretty funny.
[855.82 → 857.16] Am I supposed to use that for that?
[857.22 → 857.80] Probably not, right?
[857.88 → 858.12] No.
[858.28 → 858.92] Yeah, probably not.
[859.00 → 859.18] Okay.
[859.32 → 859.68] Who cares?
[859.68 → 860.40] Well, that never happened.
[860.52 → 861.54] Maybe it does.
[862.58 → 865.34] I bet you've used one of those photos for work at some point.
[865.64 → 866.06] Oh, no.
[866.32 → 867.56] That's definitely a thing.
[867.66 → 868.08] Then it's fine.
[868.14 → 869.10] That's 100% a thing.
[869.24 → 869.72] I think it's fine.
[869.76 → 871.22] I take lots of pictures for work.
[871.40 → 871.52] Yeah.
[871.80 → 876.04] Man, we finally have the AMD challenge part two coming.
[876.36 → 877.28] Labs Jake.
[878.30 → 879.52] Danes, I guess I could say.
[879.60 → 879.74] Yeah.
[879.82 → 880.72] Is saying that he can help.
[881.42 → 881.64] Oh.
[881.94 → 882.18] Oh.
[882.32 → 883.34] Which he probably can.
[883.46 → 884.28] Makes a lot of sense.
[884.28 → 885.20] Yeah, that makes a ton of sense.
[886.64 → 891.08] Speaking of taking photos for work, AMD Radeon challenge part two is coming.
[891.48 → 891.58] Yes.
[891.58 → 894.04] You have some more stuff that you're planning to look at this weekend.
[894.14 → 894.22] Yeah.
[894.22 → 895.50] When are you even going to have time this weekend?
[895.68 → 897.12] I know I'm seeing you this weekend.
[897.22 → 897.70] I don't know.
[898.42 → 899.34] You're going to be gaming?
[899.50 → 900.86] Because I'm also busy on Saturday.
[900.88 → 901.92] Because you're not gaming tonight.
[902.34 → 902.70] Nope.
[902.92 → 903.20] Clearly.
[905.12 → 905.48] Cool.
[905.62 → 906.30] Well, good luck with that.
[906.32 → 906.84] I'll figure it out.
[906.84 → 910.68] Luke will be gaming during family dinner.
[910.90 → 915.46] Just like, okay, everyone just bring the table into Luke's gaming space.
[915.62 → 916.88] And we'll just all sit around there.
[917.00 → 917.80] And Luke will just...
[917.80 → 918.84] He'll be facing the other way.
[918.90 → 923.02] He'll just turn around and take bites while he evaluates the Radeon experience.
[923.30 → 924.04] I'll figure something out.
[924.08 → 925.56] To be clear, a lot of...
[925.56 → 927.46] Luke has spent a ton of time with the card.
[927.60 → 929.52] But I did it like six months ago?
[929.68 → 931.34] It was not six months ago.
[931.50 → 932.46] I think it was.
[932.54 → 933.46] It was five months ago.
[933.80 → 934.16] Okay.
[934.16 → 939.22] Also, by the time we actually release the video, it might be six months.
[939.42 → 942.96] Because it was supposed to come out, you know, recently.
[943.16 → 943.86] And it hasn't yet.
[944.06 → 944.26] Yeah.
[944.58 → 944.78] Yeah.
[945.20 → 947.52] But yeah, so I have all my notes from testing it back then.
[947.58 → 951.48] But if we're releasing the video now, it doesn't seem very fair.
[951.64 → 953.62] So I'm still going to keep some of the comments from back then.
[953.68 → 956.82] But frame it properly as, this is how it was like back then.
[957.04 → 959.36] And then test it now with new drivers and all that kind of stuff.
[959.44 → 959.90] And see if it's better.
[961.42 → 961.78] Yeah.
[961.78 → 964.14] Float plane wants the bread cam back for us.
[964.20 → 965.48] So I guess they can have it for a little bit.
[965.52 → 965.54] Bread cam.
[966.68 → 968.16] Why don't we talk about Disney?
[968.34 → 969.92] Mixing DVDs in Australia.
[970.12 → 971.32] What is going on?
[971.38 → 972.10] Yeah, this sucks.
[972.48 → 975.88] Disney will no longer release physical media in Australia and New Zealand.
[976.30 → 983.30] Disney movies and television shows will only be available via streaming following the physical release of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.
[983.30 → 990.92] Australia and New Zealand are actually the third media market where Disney has cut physical media releases.
[991.32 → 1001.14] Disney discontinued DVDs and Blu-rays in Latin America and most of Asia in 2020, a year after the launch of Disney+, citing low physical media sales.
[1001.14 → 1011.48] In May of this year, Disney removed over 50 titles from its streaming service as part of a $1.5 billion content write-off.
[1011.70 → 1020.50] This included Crater, a Disney Plus exclusive, which was released on May 12, 2023 and removed seven weeks later on June 30.
[1020.50 → 1024.14] The film is now unavailable anywhere on the internet.
[1025.02 → 1026.82] I beg to differ, but okay.
[1026.90 → 1029.68] Except for some places on the internet.
[1030.60 → 1039.80] Disney has also censored content such as 1992's The Muppets Christmas Carol, where they digitally removed a cigarette from a puppet's mouth.
[1040.82 → 1041.10] Okay.
[1041.56 → 1045.22] So far, only WandaVision, Loki and The Mandalorian.
[1045.68 → 1050.28] Those are the only Disney Plus shows that have officially announced physical releases anywhere in the world.
[1050.28 → 1054.24] Okay, so we need to talk about content.
[1054.92 → 1074.62] I know that it's not quite exactly what's going on here, but it is very clear to me that the TV and movie business, as we've known it for our entire lives, is fundamentally broken.
[1075.08 → 1075.38] Oh, yeah.
[1076.00 → 1078.56] How many days is the writer's strike going on now?
[1078.56 → 1079.36] Like 110?
[1079.88 → 1080.18] Oh, dude.
[1080.28 → 1081.22] Or something like that?
[1081.70 → 1083.02] It's a long time.
[1083.56 → 1093.16] I was talking about this with Ed earlier today, before the show, and he seems to feel like the situation is pretty cut and dried.
[1093.16 → 1102.58] He's basically going like, yeah, I mean, eventually the studios will have to concede something, and the writers and actors will go back to work.
[1102.72 → 1108.96] But what he thinks is going to happen is we're just going to see, they'll get paid more, they'll get more residuals.
[1108.96 → 1114.62] Whatever it is that compromise ends up looking like, but we're going to get a lot less shows.
[1114.84 → 1116.32] And probably a lot less chances.
[1117.36 → 1118.78] Like, you know what I mean by that?
[1118.78 → 1120.94] They're going to risk less, do more boring things.
[1120.94 → 1123.82] I mean, but that's already the direction it's been going.
[1123.82 → 1124.56] Yeah, I know, I know.
[1124.72 → 1126.22] But I feel like it'll get worse.
[1127.18 → 1142.18] I'm honestly, even as someone who doesn't really rely that much on TV and movies for my entertainment, like if I have absolutely nothing to do, and you put a gun to my head, and you say, okay, do something to entertain yourself.
[1143.02 → 1144.68] I'm going to go to a video game.
[1144.76 → 1148.88] I'm not going to, I'm not typically going to go to a TV show or to a movie.
[1149.36 → 1152.04] So this is kind of random stuff.
[1152.08 → 1152.78] It's from The Vice.
[1153.32 → 1159.60] They said the previous writer's strike in kind of 2007 to 2008 lasted for 100 days.
[1159.94 → 1164.84] The longest strike on record in 1988 lasted for 153 days.
[1165.14 → 1169.80] Okay, so we're not even record-breaking yet, but still, this is brutal.
[1169.80 → 1173.80] So far, I think this was as of the 23rd.
[1174.54 → 1175.76] So that's two days.
[1175.86 → 1177.36] So it's been 115 days, I think.
[1177.46 → 1187.38] But something you got to consider too is like looking at all the interviews and like the articles that are coming out from the writers, like they are going into, they're over three months.
[1187.80 → 1189.42] Whiskey Nerd 88 and Float plane Chat.
[1189.54 → 1196.04] So a U.S. judge just ruled today AI content cannot be copyrighted, which includes TV and movies.
[1196.14 → 1199.00] Okay, we're going to be talking about that a little bit later in the show, I think.
[1199.00 → 1199.44] Interesting.
[1199.80 → 1202.00] Um, or are we?
[1202.46 → 1203.68] Is that not in here anymore?
[1204.28 → 1204.80] Oh, okay.
[1204.88 → 1205.88] Apparently that's not in here anymore.
[1205.98 → 1208.64] Okay, well, it was planned to be in the dock at some point, I think.
[1209.24 → 1211.04] Um, okay, well, what was I saying?
[1211.16 → 1211.32] Something.
[1211.68 → 1212.16] Right, yeah.
[1212.22 → 1214.16] So they're going over, they're over three months now.
[1214.16 → 1226.76] But like, from everything that I'm reading, a lot of these people not only are over three months without work now, but they are, they were not being well compensated before that.
[1227.08 → 1228.58] They don't have cash reserves.
[1228.58 → 1230.68] And I don't, you'll have to forgive me.
[1230.68 → 1234.50] I have not looked into the previous strikes in the 2000s and in the 80s.
[1234.50 → 1246.06] Um, but what I would not be surprised to hear is that at that time, they may have been in a more comfortable position in their lives overall compared to right now.
[1246.06 → 1252.28] And I am, I'm really worried that the studios are just not going to budge on this.
[1252.28 → 1261.76] And the number that really stands out to me here is just like the personal life impact of going into debt because of trying to fight for this is brutal.
[1261.90 → 1267.30] The $1.5 billion content write-off, that number stands out to me.
[1267.58 → 1276.28] And the reason for it is that that's how worthless this content has become to their business.
[1276.28 → 1290.98] That they would literally rather delete it from the internet, not provide it to anyone, and just use it as a loss, as a tax write-off compared to keeping it up.
[1291.76 → 1299.90] So if that's the state of things, what are the odds that they're going to be, you know, champing at the bit to make more content?
[1300.40 → 1305.72] Even before all this went down, I'm not sure if we talked about this on the show before, but the CW.
[1305.72 → 1310.12] I don't know if you guys know CW Network, but they've done a lot of shows over the years.
[1310.20 → 1312.20] One of the ones that I liked back in the day was Millville.
[1312.48 → 1315.40] I don't know if anyone knows, cares about Millville anymore.
[1315.48 → 1315.84] Probably not.
[1316.16 → 1317.58] I don't watch a lot of TV anymore.
[1317.68 → 1318.48] Is that a Canadian thing?
[1318.98 → 1319.34] CW?
[1319.56 → 1321.62] Because Millville was filmed here.
[1321.78 → 1323.12] It was filmed like...
[1323.12 → 1323.92] No, it's not Canadian.
[1324.06 → 1327.66] CW just did, used to shoot a lot in Canada.
[1327.90 → 1332.48] But before the strike even started, they basically just packed up and moved out.
[1332.48 → 1339.58] Yeah, because I've mentioned Millville to a few people, and all the Americans don't seem to know what it is.
[1339.58 → 1339.72] Oh, really?
[1339.72 → 1341.88] So I thought it was maybe just like a Canadian thing.
[1342.04 → 1344.58] But yeah, there's a bunch of people in chat saying it's in America.
[1344.70 → 1347.14] So maybe I just happened to...
[1347.14 → 1348.70] My sample size was small.
[1348.80 → 1350.16] Yeah, another big number.
[1350.60 → 1355.24] So in the UK, you can't abstract how much each of your productions cost.
[1355.24 → 1359.50] You can't just like bundle them all together and say, okay, well, here are a bunch of productions we did, and this is how much they cost.
[1360.08 → 1364.14] They require you to report exactly how much you spent on each production.
[1364.34 → 1366.22] Do you know how much they spent on the Willow reboot?
[1367.36 → 1367.62] Oh.
[1370.00 → 1370.72] No idea.
[1371.28 → 1372.40] $100 million.
[1373.12 → 1373.38] Yeah.
[1373.84 → 1374.48] $100 million.
[1375.06 → 1378.34] That was up for, I think, six months before they pulled it down.
[1378.34 → 1388.02] And so the negotiating position for the writers in particular is like, these guys already didn't want to make content.
[1388.78 → 1391.12] They were already just going, okay, forget it.
[1391.16 → 1392.86] This is like actually not even worth it.
[1392.88 → 1393.70] We'll just pull it down.
[1396.86 → 1397.84] What are we going to...
[1397.84 → 1399.48] Like, what TV shows are we going to watch?
[1400.78 → 1402.64] How are they going to move forward?
[1402.64 → 1409.94] Oh, man, I read this really sad article about a dry cleaner.
[1411.00 → 1411.96] Hollywood dry cleaner.
[1412.34 → 1415.82] Like, the kind of collateral damage that wouldn't even occur to me.
[1416.34 → 1422.08] Because your family member worked in the production industry for some time.
[1422.88 → 1424.46] What would you say...
[1424.46 → 1424.72] To them.
[1425.00 → 1426.48] Well, yeah, okay.
[1426.56 → 1427.46] I mean on set.
[1427.68 → 1428.12] Okay, yeah.
[1428.12 → 1428.24] Yeah.
[1428.54 → 1429.28] Well...
[1429.28 → 1430.00] Okay, that's fair.
[1431.06 → 1431.92] I know what you mean.
[1431.92 → 1432.62] That's what I'm about to say.
[1432.62 → 1432.84] Yeah, I know what you mean.
[1432.96 → 1433.34] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1433.34 → 1434.12] They work directly.
[1434.12 → 1435.60] They would have direct experience with this.
[1435.64 → 1435.82] Okay?
[1436.08 → 1436.54] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1436.56 → 1437.06] Help me out here, okay?
[1437.16 → 1437.80] I know what you mean.
[1438.16 → 1438.56] Okay.
[1438.80 → 1441.94] So that particular family member, you know which one I'm talking about.
[1442.06 → 1443.14] Please don't make this difficult.
[1443.14 → 1443.54] Yeah.
[1446.42 → 1454.62] How often, with the way that talent treats their clothes, how often would you say that those clothes probably need to be cleaned?
[1454.80 → 1455.96] Yeah, I'm assuming...
[1455.96 → 1459.90] I haven't actually specifically talked to her about this, but I'm assuming a lot.
[1459.90 → 1463.74] All of a sudden, Hollywood dry cleaner.
[1464.00 → 1464.24] Yeah.
[1465.20 → 1465.60] Gone.
[1465.72 → 1466.54] See you later, business.
[1466.74 → 1466.92] Yeah.
[1468.02 → 1469.42] No, and it's everything, right?
[1469.44 → 1470.30] It's not just the productions.
[1470.58 → 1472.34] It's the promotions for the productions.
[1472.34 → 1478.26] And you just fought through the COVID era, which even though a lot of things kept filming,
[1478.40 → 1481.10] I'm sure the rest of your traffic was majorly reduced.
[1481.44 → 1481.62] Yeah.
[1481.88 → 1487.76] Well, yeah, they've been hit hard by work from home because people don't need their professional clothes.
[1487.76 → 1488.44] That too.
[1489.60 → 1490.38] Yeah, yikes.
[1490.90 → 1494.28] So it's not just like, woe is me, what TV will I watch?
[1494.42 → 1497.68] It's what is actually going to happen to not just this industry.
[1497.80 → 1501.52] It's also like food services companies are struggling right now.
[1501.58 → 1510.42] What is going to happen to all the like feeder industries that rely on this money that's coming in from people going to the theatre?
[1510.42 → 1513.42] From people, well, I mean, cable cutting, right?
[1513.50 → 1515.22] Like there's no money going in for that.
[1515.58 → 1520.68] Camel and Flow plane Chat said there's a studio near Berlin, Germany, which is struggling right now because of the strike.
[1521.06 → 1522.56] It might even have to close.
[1523.04 → 1524.02] A studio near what, sorry?
[1524.58 → 1525.52] Berlin, Germany.
[1525.64 → 1529.76] Because I guess whatever they film is written, I'm assuming.
[1530.02 → 1530.44] Right.
[1530.74 → 1531.14] Okay.
[1531.32 → 1532.04] In the US.
[1532.38 → 1532.86] I'm assuming.
[1533.08 → 1533.52] I don't know.
[1533.60 → 1533.96] Brutal.
[1533.96 → 1534.76] I thought that would make sense.
[1535.12 → 1536.92] I have a controversial take.
[1538.70 → 1545.22] I think that this is a huge opportunity for like the South Korean film industry.
[1546.04 → 1546.48] Oh, yeah.
[1546.48 → 1547.10] Because they're big.
[1547.48 → 1547.70] Yeah.
[1547.88 → 1551.40] And they're doing really cool, really innovative stuff.
[1551.54 → 1552.00] Dramas, right?
[1552.06 → 1552.58] Korean dramas?
[1552.82 → 1554.12] Well, not just that.
[1554.12 → 1557.98] I mean, they've had theatrical breakout hits as well.
[1557.98 → 1566.64] And I think that in the absence of new Western produced content, I think there's going to be a lot more appetite.
[1566.94 → 1568.08] People are going to watch something.
[1568.46 → 1569.18] They'll watch something.
[1569.26 → 1570.48] People want to be entertained.
[1571.16 → 1571.76] What about anime?
[1573.46 → 1574.38] I don't know that.
[1574.56 → 1575.54] Does anime jump more mainstream?
[1575.90 → 1580.24] I don't know that people are going to just cross into different genres.
[1580.24 → 1581.58] I think you're going to see some of that.
[1582.40 → 1582.84] I mean.
[1583.08 → 1583.32] Okay.
[1583.34 → 1584.26] So people like their shows.
[1584.36 → 1586.70] If you want your dramas, you get your dramas, that type of stuff.
[1586.90 → 1587.18] Yeah.
[1587.18 → 1591.06] And I would be like, if people like comedy, I suspect they're probably going to watch.
[1591.72 → 1593.22] They're going to want to watch comedy, right?
[1593.24 → 1593.36] Yeah.
[1594.74 → 1597.50] But I do think, yeah, you'll probably see some of that.
[1597.58 → 1605.24] I think that the back catalogue owners are probably going to benefit from this because they don't have to spend any money producing anything,
[1605.24 → 1609.22] but they can license out their back catalogues because people are going to want to watch something.
[1609.22 → 1614.20] I mean, it's not the way that I consume content, but the way that, yeah, don't forget Bollywood.
[1614.50 → 1614.64] Yeah.
[1614.70 → 1615.50] A hundred percent.
[1615.62 → 1616.20] Thank you, chat.
[1616.20 → 1617.92] Some Bollywood stuff is amazing.
[1618.24 → 1618.58] Yeah.
[1619.54 → 1620.90] Like, actually very entertaining.
[1621.14 → 1627.88] Like, the real risk to the industry right now is that it used to be that Hollywood was the only show in town.
[1628.10 → 1630.58] Diversification of global interest type of situation.
[1630.76 → 1631.12] Yeah.
[1631.58 → 1634.18] They are totally not.
[1634.18 → 1638.36] There's some perfect quality stuff being done in China now, too.
[1639.08 → 1644.26] Like, China's film industry in, like, what, the 90s is basically irrelevant, right?
[1645.06 → 1645.66] Yeah, not anymore.
[1645.72 → 1647.30] But they're pumping now.
[1647.52 → 1648.38] They're going hard.
[1648.38 → 1654.86] I, uh, okay, so right, so back to Disney nixing DVDs and Blu-rays in Australia.
[1654.86 → 1662.44] So a couple of things here is, one, we're just seeing this general withdrawal from even bothering
[1662.44 → 1663.28] anymore.
[1663.50 → 1664.72] Should we drop the bread cam?
[1664.82 → 1666.44] How long have we had the bread came up?
[1666.50 → 1666.78] I don't know.
[1666.78 → 1669.46] Dan, what the heck?
[1671.20 → 1672.40] The bread is precious.
[1673.80 → 1675.64] So many people aren't even going to get it.
[1675.76 → 1676.78] That's why I was saying.
[1678.70 → 1680.66] A lot of people aren't going to get it.
[1680.76 → 1681.04] Okay.
[1681.82 → 1682.26] Yeah.
[1682.38 → 1682.78] Anyway.
[1683.74 → 1685.62] Sorry, what am I talking about?
[1685.62 → 1688.46] Uh, content disappearing off the internet.
[1688.84 → 1691.54] Um, uh, off the, off the.
[1691.54 → 1691.56] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1691.56 → 1695.64] So Disney, Disney's, you know, withdrawing basically on every front, basically going,
[1696.16 → 1702.74] how much does it cost to, like, print and ship a plastic Blu-ray disc?
[1702.96 → 1703.44] Oh, yeah.
[1703.60 → 1705.28] Like, functionally nothing.
[1706.18 → 1710.84] And if they're basically saying, yeah, this, like, isn't even worth it for the we know,
[1710.90 → 1714.58] whatever localization that we're going to have to do, um, you know,
[1714.58 → 1719.82] I mean, it's Australia and New Zealand.
[1719.96 → 1722.86] Like, what, what localization are they even, are they even doing?
[1722.98 → 1726.66] Do all the do, do you guys have dubbing down there and all the characters just, like,
[1726.70 → 1727.84] speak in Australian accents?
[1727.94 → 1729.66] Is that a is that a and I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[1729.74 → 1731.10] I obviously know that didn't, doesn't happen.
[1731.56 → 1736.54] Um, so, so yeah, it's, it's not even worth the minimal localization effort that it would
[1736.54 → 1737.96] take to distribute content.
[1738.48 → 1744.02] Um, that, so that's problem number one is, like, do they just become a theme park company?
[1744.02 → 1750.62] Uh, problem number two is that not only does this mean that people who don't have great
[1750.62 → 1755.54] internet connections are not going to have as easy access to content, but it also means
[1755.54 → 1762.84] that the highest quality version of this content is simply not going to be available anymore.
[1762.84 → 1766.60] And that really sucks.
[1767.86 → 1768.34] Yeah.
[1768.90 → 1769.38] Yeah.
[1769.44 → 1770.12] It's kind of brutal.
[1770.54 → 1779.72] I'm happy that like archiving of this type of media has become more of a collective work
[1779.72 → 1781.10] fairly recently.
[1781.10 → 1783.40] It feels for a long time there.
[1783.48 → 1787.02] It was just like, ah, yard, people pirating for their own personal gain.
[1787.10 → 1791.52] And it's been kind of shifting to groups of people trying to archive things because they're
[1791.52 → 1796.70] just being, I mean, $1.5 billion worth of content was just ripped off of this platform
[1796.70 → 1798.34] is no longer available at all.
[1799.16 → 1802.86] Um, so I, I mean, I'm happy people are archiving.
[1802.86 → 1803.78] So tell me this.
[1804.30 → 1807.86] I know from talking to you both on the show and personally.
[1808.14 → 1808.34] Yeah.
[1808.42 → 1811.30] That Steam was a turning point for you for game piracy.
[1812.08 → 1812.56] Yeah.
[1812.88 → 1819.36] I know that Spotify or similar was the turning point for you for music piracy.
[1819.58 → 1819.80] Yeah.
[1822.06 → 1823.90] I'm about to ask a spicy question.
[1823.90 → 1829.52] Are you going to go back to movie and TV show piracy if there's not a reasonable mean
[1829.52 → 1831.86] to get a quality version of the content?
[1832.48 → 1835.90] I will do what I can to legally acquire the content.
[1837.36 → 1840.26] Do you plan a future career in politics?
[1840.76 → 1841.80] I'm just wondering.
[1843.94 → 1847.32] Seriously, it's an honest question because you're on this show, same as me.
[1847.52 → 1852.58] And yet somehow you managed to come out of pretty much every controversy completely unscathed
[1852.58 → 1854.94] while I dig myself deeper and deeper into various holes.
[1855.86 → 1857.26] I've had some, I've had some.
[1857.44 → 1858.70] Clearly you need to coach me.
[1858.78 → 1859.96] I've had some hits recently.
[1861.40 → 1862.30] That's fair enough.
[1863.18 → 1872.28] Um, yeah, I, uh, I, I mean, I, I've been totally blunt.
[1872.40 → 1878.06] I, you know, physical backing of, I, I have no problem downloading something that I have a
[1878.06 → 1879.88] I have a physical paid backup for.
[1879.88 → 1883.72] I, I, I don't like legally as still piracy.
[1884.68 → 1885.72] Like, I don't care.
[1885.84 → 1886.92] That doesn't matter to me.
[1887.10 → 1890.32] Um, if they've gotten their money, I just don't really see what the issue is.
[1890.54 → 1894.30] Um, so yeah, I'm lazy, and I just download things if I want to watch them.
[1894.40 → 1898.64] And then it's just, you know, it's a quick, like couple of clicks to put something in the
[1898.64 → 1900.60] pile to make sure that I can not feel bad about it.
[1900.60 → 1910.70] Um, but I think that more broadly putting people back in the piracy pipeline, like making people
[1910.70 → 1915.44] go to the effort to, you know, find a good private tracker or whatever else.
[1915.78 → 1920.32] Once they've got it set up, are they going to come back to the streaming services, especially
[1920.32 → 1922.44] if they're not getting fresh new content all the time?
[1922.44 → 1926.48] Like, is this whole business just dead?
[1926.58 → 1927.56] Kind of shattering itself?
[1927.82 → 1928.18] Yeah.
[1929.18 → 1936.10] Um, I, I do know a very significant amount of people have been, uh, I won't say forced
[1936.10 → 1942.74] or made to go back to, but, uh, heavily nudged back in the direction of privacy and, or piracy,
[1942.80 → 1943.16] I should say.
[1943.22 → 1943.38] Sorry.
[1943.38 → 1945.84] Um, and they've been embracing it.
[1946.26 → 1951.12] The amount of, the amount of memes that I've seen where it's like, you know, the, the,
[1951.22 → 1955.82] the old meme back in the day of like, goodbye old friend.
[1955.82 → 1960.80] And he puts the old ratty pirate hat in the box and there's like Netflix or whatever there.
[1960.92 → 1964.68] The amount of memes that I've seen where they take it back out of the box because there's
[1964.68 → 1966.56] like Netflix and all these other ones there.
[1966.76 → 1970.98] And now the problem isn't even that it isn't that there are too many platforms, and it costs a
[1970.98 → 1972.48] ton to be able to access everything.
[1972.48 → 1974.62] Uh, it's that you can't.
[1976.06 → 1978.48] So we're, yeah, we're going back to old methods.
[1978.72 → 1979.08] Oh crap.
[1979.14 → 1980.74] We need to do something really quick here.
[1980.88 → 1984.74] Um, guys, we don't do, uh, super chats here.
[1984.84 → 1986.02] We do merch messages.
[1986.36 → 1989.06] And the reason is one that I am about to show you.
[1989.12 → 1989.34] Hold on.
[1989.36 → 1990.84] I just need to screen share perfect.
[1991.12 → 1991.82] Where's my screen share?
[1992.80 → 1994.60] Did you take away my screen share, Dan?
[1999.48 → 2000.80] I might've done that.
[2000.90 → 2001.44] Uh, okay.
[2001.44 → 2002.94] I do need my screen share though.
[2003.34 → 2003.72] Okay.
[2003.86 → 2005.06] Can I have it back, please?
[2005.16 → 2005.64] Are you ready?
[2005.98 → 2006.70] Yes, I'm ready.
[2007.74 → 2008.02] Okay.
[2008.20 → 2011.50] So this is why we've talked about this before.
[2011.68 → 2013.24] I can't emphasize this enough.
[2013.40 → 2017.12] We do not do super chats because look at this.
[2017.30 → 2018.96] Here's the viewer activity feed.
[2019.42 → 2019.94] Okay.
[2019.94 → 2021.78] People are sending super chats anyway.
[2021.78 → 2021.84] Okay.
[2021.84 → 2021.94] Okay.
[2021.94 → 2022.28] Okay.
[2022.28 → 2022.38] Okay.
[2022.38 → 2022.44] Okay.
[2022.44 → 2022.50] Okay.
[2022.50 → 2024.24] Okay.
[2024.24 → 2030.94] This super chat for $200 is not in the viewer activity feed.
[2031.12 → 2032.28] It is broken.
[2033.26 → 2035.20] So we almost missed this.
[2037.18 → 2039.30] You need a solution to super chats.
[2039.62 → 2040.88] I hadn't read this yet.
[2041.18 → 2043.32] There isn't a solution to super chats.
[2043.62 → 2044.08] They're broken.
[2044.48 → 2046.22] We've told them for a long time about this.
[2046.30 → 2047.38] Yeah, YouTube knows.
[2047.38 → 2048.18] We've called this.
[2048.28 → 2050.44] We've been talking to them about this for over a year.
[2051.02 → 2054.52] This is literally why the team developed merch messages.
[2054.68 → 2060.02] Because we could easily miss a $200 super chat because YouTube doesn't see fit.
[2060.12 → 2064.04] Dan, can you move us out of the corner so they can see I'm not just faking this or something?
[2064.42 → 2071.46] I've had so many people accuse me of, you know, it's just an excuse for them to promote merch messages.
[2071.96 → 2073.48] No, super chats are broken.
[2073.74 → 2074.20] I've done so.
[2074.20 → 2075.62] Merch messages are also pretty cool.
[2075.62 → 2083.50] They're also, like, way better because then you can just get your order in the mail instead of just giving half of the money to Google, who definitely needs more money.
[2084.28 → 2085.42] Yeah, that's it.
[2085.74 → 2087.04] That's everything that's there.
[2087.80 → 2090.10] This did not show up.
[2091.06 → 2092.74] Is that wild or what?
[2093.28 → 2094.98] I mean, at least your other one did, I guess.
[2095.24 → 2096.48] So, hey, thanks, Paul.
[2097.86 → 2100.70] But please, use merch messages.
[2100.70 → 2103.66] I guess now's as good a time as any to explain what merch messages are.
[2103.76 → 2110.30] If you go on LTTstore.com, and you go to the cart, anytime we're live, you're going to see a little box for a merch message.
[2110.46 → 2112.70] That will go into a dashboard where our producer Dan...
[2113.98 → 2114.24] Ugh.
[2115.50 → 2122.76] Where our producer Dan will curate them for me and Luke to discuss or pop them up in the bottom or what is one or the other.
[2122.80 → 2123.10] Oh, yeah.
[2123.18 → 2125.12] Sometimes Dan will just reply to you.
[2125.12 → 2129.94] So you can go ahead, place an order, whether it's, you know, a screwdriver or a hoodie or whatever the case may be.
[2130.02 → 2135.82] The great thing about merch messages is that, hey, we try our best, but if we don't get to your merch message, at least you get your order in the mail.
[2136.20 → 2138.90] And you're not just throwing money at the screen for no reason.
[2139.02 → 2140.52] Dan, do you have a couple merch messages for us?
[2141.00 → 2142.06] I do, actually.
[2142.20 → 2142.98] Yeah, I got a couple here.
[2143.28 → 2143.64] Fantastic.
[2144.08 → 2145.40] Welcome back, LLD.
[2145.68 → 2148.46] Glad to see you and the whole team are back on the upswing.
[2148.46 → 2153.10] If you decide to encase the bread in resin, can you please make it a float plane exclusive?
[2153.74 → 2154.94] I didn't want to read that one.
[2154.94 → 2156.04] No, but I did anyway.
[2156.18 → 2156.72] I'm sorry.
[2158.18 → 2161.60] Do we need to provide people context for this stupid piece of bread, Luke?
[2161.72 → 2163.44] Can you explain this to the people?
[2164.34 → 2165.00] Well, okay.
[2165.02 → 2165.46] Oh, stop.
[2165.86 → 2172.64] As far as my understanding goes, because I was not there when the how does it go?
[2173.10 → 2174.94] I was there when the words were written or whatever.
[2175.32 → 2180.22] Oh, do not cite the deep magic to me, which I was there when they were written or something like that.
[2180.22 → 2181.72] I was not there when it was written.
[2181.72 → 2182.00] Yeah.
[2182.00 → 2189.86] But as far as my understanding goes, the discord was like, okay, it's actually going to be nuts to just talk about this for however long.
[2189.86 → 2193.04] So we are now a bread discord.
[2193.32 → 2193.92] I see.
[2194.62 → 2197.58] Which I thought was hilarious and people liked it.
[2197.88 → 2199.28] And now we have this.
[2200.72 → 2213.64] There was also, I think this was come to after the idea of it becoming a bread discord, but I saw a few people talking about how they liked the bread theme because to find peace, you bake bread.
[2213.98 → 2214.86] Break bread.
[2214.86 → 2216.02] And I liked that.
[2216.20 → 2219.86] Jackson asks about wireless GPUs.
[2222.08 → 2222.56] Okay.
[2223.46 → 2225.74] Oh, we did a video about one recently.
[2225.84 → 2229.26] It just had like wide eye, like wireless, uh, wireless display output.
[2229.68 → 2232.32] Um, no, I don't expect that to take off.
[2232.38 → 2242.86] It's so niche that basically the people who want it are going to be willing to pay extra for an external adapter that just takes a standard video output off your GPU,
[2242.86 → 2246.44] converts it to wireless and then beams it to wherever the heck it needs to go.
[2246.52 → 2265.28] I think the market for a GPU that's built from the ground up to transmit a display signal wirelessly is going to be tiny, uh, compared to the folks that would just have wireless, you know, sitting in a slot next to it or like bolted to the side of the chassis or whatever else.
[2265.28 → 2271.80] As part of a as part of a less integrated, but, um, probably overall more cost-effective solution.
[2271.88 → 2279.28] I mean, that was the big problem was the one wireless GPU that ever did exist cost basically the same as just buying a GPU and a wireless HDMI transmitter.
[2279.70 → 2284.68] So it's like, okay, I'm sure glad we, I'm sure glad we integrated these two products.
[2284.68 → 2287.86] It's like your, your fork spoon.
[2288.08 → 2292.44] It costs exactly as much as buying a fork and a spoon, but now they're attached to each other.
[2292.90 → 2293.50] Oh, good.
[2293.58 → 2307.56] So when I don't need the spoon anymore, I can no longer use this fork or like if, if the spoon is no longer useful, if you guys kind of get what I mean, because when this GPU becomes obsolete, all you've done is attach a wireless HDMI transmitter to it that now you can't use anymore.
[2308.84 → 2309.20] Perfection.
[2309.20 → 2311.72] Um, all right, Dan, do you have one more for us?
[2312.24 → 2313.58] Yeah, I've got a couple of real ones if you want.
[2313.90 → 2314.02] Yeah.
[2314.02 → 2314.60] Yes, please.
[2314.82 → 2315.42] Hi there, DLL.
[2315.62 → 2319.46] I remember hearing about a, uh, progress on a car focused channel.
[2319.58 → 2323.64] What's the progress on this channel, and what would the style of video be like?
[2323.68 → 2326.02] Uh, for example, Marquez or Doug Demure?
[2326.40 → 2331.70] Uh, style on the channel, I mean, is going to be, uh, why would we style it after what someone else is already doing?
[2331.84 → 2334.74] The style of the channel is going to be Alex Clark in all likelihood.
[2335.00 → 2337.14] I know he's really, really passionate about the channel.
[2337.14 → 2341.14] Uh, there's a number of other people internally who I know want to contribute to it.
[2341.14 → 2351.76] With that said, I think that the, um, community, uh, sentiment rightly towards us launching another channel right now would probably be pretty low.
[2352.14 → 2362.32] And, uh, so right now any new channel projects are on hold until such time as we have really nailed down our processes for the existing channels.
[2362.32 → 2365.88] Uh, car channel is realistically a matter of time.
[2365.88 → 2371.44] I think that Alex's energy shines through so much.
[2371.44 → 2376.36] Like his car videos are just my favourite to watch.
[2376.36 → 2380.82] I, I, I watched, I don't even care about cars, but I watched this one on the Polestar too.
[2380.88 → 2382.72] And I was just, I don't know.
[2382.72 → 2383.98] I just wanted a bag of popcorn, right?
[2383.98 → 2386.10] Like he's just, he's so excited and it's so infectious.
[2386.50 → 2392.94] Um, I'm excited for it, but it's not the kind of thing that we're going to rush into right now.
[2392.94 → 2394.42] If that makes sense.
[2394.80 → 2395.98] Yeah, I think so.
[2396.06 → 2397.12] That probably makes sense.
[2397.18 → 2397.44] Yeah.
[2397.66 → 2397.88] Yeah.
[2398.30 → 2399.78] Speaking of things that make sense.
[2400.04 → 2400.44] Yeah.
[2400.74 → 2401.38] Next topic.
[2401.60 → 2402.02] Yeah, sure.
[2402.08 → 2402.30] Why not?
[2402.38 → 2402.70] Why not?
[2402.98 → 2403.60] It's a free country.
[2404.40 → 2405.54] You want to run this one?
[2405.60 → 2408.32] Child influencers can now sue their parents for wage theft.
[2408.42 → 2408.98] I think there's some.
[2408.98 → 2409.20] Nope.
[2409.20 → 2412.62] I think I'm just going to sit here and look smug while you read it.
[2412.96 → 2420.96] Illinois has passed a law ensuring compensation for underage social media entertainers taking effect July next year.
[2421.06 → 2431.62] If a child under 16 is featured in at least 30% of monetized content, uh, I'm excited for 29% attendance in upcoming videos.
[2431.62 → 2442.30] Um, but if they're featured in at least 30% of monetized content in a 12-month period, a percentage of earnings must be placed in a trust account for the child.
[2443.08 → 2446.10] The percentage is based on the amount of time that that child is featured.
[2446.32 → 2452.42] Uh, if they're in say 50% of a video, they would be entitled to 25% of that video's earnings.
[2452.60 → 2453.68] How does that math work?
[2454.20 → 2454.48] Half.
[2454.48 → 2456.56] That seems like an arbitrary video.
[2456.86 → 2457.22] Half.
[2457.22 → 2460.04] If they're in 50% of a video.
[2460.24 → 2460.52] Yes.
[2460.78 → 2463.42] They get a quarter of the earnings.
[2463.86 → 2467.34] I think it's half of the amount of the video that you're in.
[2467.48 → 2467.86] Okay.
[2468.26 → 2469.66] I wonder how they came to that number.
[2469.74 → 2471.52] I'm not saying that's a wrong number.
[2471.52 → 2471.68] I have no idea.
[2471.94 → 2474.54] I just am curious.
[2474.72 → 2475.60] Yeah, not a clue.
[2476.16 → 2481.08] Uh, while some other states require parents to set aside earnings for child entertainers in movies and television,
[2481.08 → 2484.70] Illinois is the first state to target child labour in social media.
[2484.70 → 2492.08] The idea for the law was reportedly suggested by then 15-year-old Shreya Nakamoto,
[2492.84 → 2499.64] uh, who felt that parents were putting incredibly intimate and private moments of their children's lives online.
[2499.64 → 2505.50] And that those children were often too young to fully understand the implications, which is 100% true.
[2505.64 → 2506.80] Very fair and true.
[2506.88 → 2508.48] Like absolutely a thing.
[2508.48 → 2508.88] Yeah.
[2509.04 → 2513.96] I, um, I was shocked.
[2514.54 → 2515.68] You know, you know, sorry.
[2515.98 → 2527.88] You know, you know how there's that like shocking, horrifying moment, uh, that's been in TV a bunch of times and stuff where like, uh, your, your new partner comes over to your parents' house for the first time.
[2527.94 → 2531.38] And your mom busts out the like little kid's album to embarrass you.
[2531.38 → 2531.52] Sure.
[2531.52 → 2534.88] Now it's on the internet for every next level.
[2535.04 → 2535.40] Yeah.
[2536.08 → 2542.16] I was shocked to see some of the bad takes in the community when we've talked about this in the past.
[2542.54 → 2543.98] Like they're my kids.
[2544.06 → 2553.04] What's the difference between this and, you know, washing dishes, doing chores or like, you know, it's no one's business for the state to come in and tell me what, how I can raise my kids.
[2553.04 → 2556.08] And it's like, this is not about how you raise your kids.
[2556.16 → 2558.34] This is about child labour.
[2560.10 → 2568.36] When someone is in a YouTube video, even if it's a YouTube video where they are playing with something, they are working.
[2568.36 → 2572.90] If it is monetized, that's the thing it's monetized.
[2573.00 → 2573.90] They're working.
[2573.90 → 2588.24] I, I, I do think that something they've done well here is that they've made the they've made the, um, the trust, um, allocation based on the actual money that it makes.
[2590.18 → 2592.34] There are arguments to be made either way.
[2592.42 → 2600.64] I think that from like a privacy standpoint from, from a, Hey, I, you know, now that I'm an adult, I, I didn't consent to that.
[2600.64 → 2601.94] Um, you shouldn't have done that.
[2602.02 → 2604.78] I think from that standpoint, we're going to see different litigation.
[2605.24 → 2607.58] Um, if the content didn't make any money.
[2607.76 → 2608.14] Right.
[2608.18 → 2612.54] But at least if the content does make money, they are getting a piece of it.
[2612.62 → 2612.84] Yeah.
[2613.12 → 2620.20] Um, but I, but I, but I like that they're not just entitled to like an hourly wage.
[2620.60 → 2626.44] I think that if they are a star and if they are, you know, featured in a significant portion of the video, you could over, what is it?
[2626.46 → 2628.18] Over 30% of the monetized content.
[2628.26 → 2628.38] Yeah.
[2628.54 → 2630.24] If they are a star in the content.
[2630.24 → 2635.10] 30% of the monetized content in a calendar year or 12 months, sorry, no 12-month period.
[2635.10 → 2635.34] Yeah.
[2635.34 → 2635.70] That's different.
[2636.14 → 2647.82] Um, and then also, so that, that enables you to receive some of the cut, and then it is 50% of the percentage of the video that you're in.
[2648.82 → 2650.70] That's how the monetization works.
[2650.96 → 2651.38] Got it.
[2651.62 → 2652.02] Yeah.
[2652.16 → 2658.62] I, um, oh man, no, I'm now I'm torn though, because on the ones where they don't make any money.
[2658.62 → 2660.88] Well, no, they should still be entitled to minimum wage.
[2662.64 → 2664.68] That's what minimum wage is.
[2664.68 → 2668.74] And the other thing too, is that it's like, oh no, it's just social media or whatever.
[2668.74 → 2675.86] But like, there's really strict laws governing how many hours a child can work, whether it can interfere with their education.
[2676.44 → 2680.22] Um, how many days they can work over, over a given period.
[2680.22 → 2682.24] And none of that is being adhered to.
[2682.24 → 2684.50] And no, they're not just your kids.
[2684.60 → 2686.80] They're not your property to just do whatever you want with.
[2686.86 → 2688.94] It's not, it's, you're not allowed to be exploitative.
[2689.32 → 2691.00] Uh, this is, this is not parenting.
[2691.16 → 2692.18] This is, this is work.
[2692.18 → 2692.50] Right.
[2692.72 → 2699.14] And even with this, even with this cut, like this doesn't address any of those issues.
[2702.14 → 2702.58] Yeah.
[2702.76 → 2704.54] So I guess what I'm trying to say is.
[2705.38 → 2706.12] It's beginning.
[2706.24 → 2707.18] I'm calling it.
[2707.28 → 2707.88] But not enough.
[2708.58 → 2709.76] There's a lot more coming.
[2709.98 → 2710.18] Yeah.
[2710.18 → 2710.36] Yeah.
[2710.36 → 2710.50] Yeah.
[2710.50 → 2712.14] There's a lot more coming.
[2712.24 → 2716.68] And you know, what's fascinating about these numbers is there's a lot of like family
[2716.68 → 2719.96] vlogging channels that have more than four kids.
[2721.32 → 2722.68] How does that work?
[2726.32 → 2729.90] I could actually see the spinning beach ball on his brain.
[2731.74 → 2733.20] Give me the math, Luke.
[2733.26 → 2734.22] What happens now?
[2734.78 → 2735.08] Yeah.
[2736.98 → 2737.54] Yeah.
[2737.54 → 2740.36] People are starting to list, uh, they're starting to list channels.
[2740.50 → 2743.80] They have a whole black, black load of kids.
[2743.86 → 2744.14] Yeah.
[2745.24 → 2749.90] Well, how do I, do the parents take anything?
[2749.90 → 2754.42] Because I, I, I, I think they should probably make something for turning their family into
[2754.42 → 2754.78] production.
[2754.78 → 2758.16] I think, you know, Kris Jenner probably did okay with all of that.
[2758.16 → 2763.64] And that's probably, you know, mostly to the benefit of, I don't know.
[2763.64 → 2769.22] Jayden raises an interesting point that I want to hear a take on is, uh, he says on top of
[2769.22 → 2773.64] influencers, the laws for types of content of kids being posted by their parents, even
[2773.64 → 2777.06] just to Facebook for friends and family needs to be tightened up a lot.
[2777.06 → 2785.46] I know of people that have made Facebook pages, uh, in the name of their child who is like
[2785.46 → 2790.68] zero and then posted things all the way up.
[2791.24 → 2793.40] Man, there's, there are so many ways for that to go.
[2793.66 → 2794.52] It's very interesting.
[2794.86 → 2801.12] On the one hand, they might look at it and go, wow, it's so cool to have this like catalogue
[2801.12 → 2803.44] of, you know, everything that I've ever done in my life.
[2803.44 → 2807.14] I'm sure some people would say that, but then there's going to be people that are like,
[2807.30 → 2809.74] wow, this is a huge invasion of my privacy.
[2809.74 → 2811.66] How could you have possibly thought that this was okay?
[2812.34 → 2812.58] Yeah.
[2815.08 → 2815.92] A little rough.
[2816.08 → 2817.48] I like the email idea.
[2817.48 → 2818.86] I've always liked the email idea.
[2819.10 → 2820.00] Here's the thing though.
[2820.04 → 2821.70] Like you've got what's okay.
[2821.76 → 2822.48] Tell me this.
[2823.10 → 2828.34] What is the difference between signing away your kids rights on Facebook and signing away
[2828.34 → 2831.20] your kids rights on a traditional media or television production?
[2831.34 → 2832.34] It's monetized versus not.
[2832.34 → 2836.84] Well, the media, I mean, either of them could be or couldn't be, I guess.
[2836.98 → 2837.30] Fair enough.
[2837.78 → 2838.86] So what's, what's the difference?
[2838.88 → 2846.34] If people just have power of attorney for their children, is, I'm not saying it's right
[2846.34 → 2848.96] for people to just post everything about their child on Facebook.
[2848.96 → 2850.40] I'm just asking, is it any different?
[2851.46 → 2853.02] Someone asked, what's the email idea?
[2853.10 → 2855.34] I don't know if this was an original idea of yours.
[2855.58 → 2856.88] Oh, it's not an original idea.
[2856.88 → 2856.94] Yeah.
[2857.38 → 2864.60] So the, the idea is that you set up an email, and then you email that email, like journal
[2864.60 → 2866.86] thoughts about the kid.
[2866.98 → 2868.40] Little fun stories and stuff like that.
[2868.58 → 2871.04] I haven't stayed as on top of it as I would have liked to.
[2871.44 → 2872.52] I mean, there's still time.
[2872.52 → 2878.72] Um, it's just one of those things that stuff happens and life gets busy, and you don't think
[2878.72 → 2882.34] to like to write a bunch of emails, but, um, there's definitely going to be some stuff there.
[2882.46 → 2887.52] It could be cool to kind of pick it back up and keep going and then like give it to them
[2887.52 → 2888.66] when they move out or something.
[2888.76 → 2888.98] Yeah.
[2889.52 → 2890.18] Could be kind of neat.
[2891.86 → 2892.66] Could be cool.
[2893.18 → 2893.86] Moving on.
[2894.50 → 2895.72] It still says two more topics.
[2896.20 → 2896.52] Yeah.
[2896.78 → 2897.20] Heck yeah.
[2897.20 → 2897.60] All right.
[2898.18 → 2900.30] Do you want to talk about the GTA six league?
[2900.30 → 2900.74] Yeah.
[2902.00 → 2904.26] I have no idea what this is about.
[2904.62 → 2909.96] The cold, hard, honest truth is that I have spent the vast majority of the week in meetings,
[2910.18 → 2911.08] deliberating on.
[2911.10 → 2911.62] Oh, me too.
[2911.80 → 2915.20] And I didn't see this coming until now, but I've read the first line and I love it.
[2915.26 → 2916.18] So I'm ready to go.
[2916.48 → 2920.70] Uh, GTA six leak conducted by teenager with an Amazon fire stick.
[2921.94 → 2922.66] Oh man.
[2922.74 → 2923.46] That sounds fire.
[2923.46 → 2929.40] A British, a British 18-year-old out on bail for blackmail fraud and hacking to us.
[2929.40 → 2937.12] Telecom companies and Nvidia as part of a teenage cyber gang has been revealed as the likely culprit
[2937.12 → 2940.66] of last year's hack of rock star and leak of GTA six footage.
[2941.02 → 2944.94] Shortly before his second arrest, the teen was doxed by rival hackers.
[2945.10 → 2952.84] When he was again released from jail, he was moved to a travel lodge hotel under strict bail conditions
[2952.84 → 2954.22] for his own safety.
[2954.40 → 2960.34] There, he apparently hacked and leaked unfinished Grand Theft Auto six gameplay using an Amazon fire stick.
[2960.56 → 2967.38] He found in his hotel TV, which allowed him to infiltrate cloud computing services with a newly purchased smartphone.
[2968.80 → 2969.24] Man.
[2969.24 → 2972.24] He also purchased on the internal rock star Slack channel.
[2972.52 → 2972.62] Posted.
[2972.98 → 2974.70] I am, uh, posted.
[2974.86 → 2975.02] Yes.
[2975.18 → 2975.36] Sorry.
[2975.46 → 2975.86] What did I say?
[2976.04 → 2976.36] Purchased?
[2976.56 → 2976.72] Yep.
[2977.04 → 2977.46] Oh boy.
[2977.88 → 2980.84] He also posted on the internal rock star Slack channel.
[2981.06 → 2982.72] I am not a rock star employee.
[2982.92 → 2983.88] I am an attacker.
[2985.26 → 2985.74] Okay.
[2985.74 → 2991.90] Uh, he likewise allegedly hacked Uber and Neobank, uh, Revolut, hopefully.
[2992.56 → 2999.44] Um, he then reportedly, uh, he, he then reportedly was caught when London police searched his hotel room.
[3002.26 → 3008.34] Is it wrong to be like, um, you know, Hey, do you like want to work here?
[3009.46 → 3010.96] I know that happens a lot.
[3011.10 → 3011.56] It does.
[3011.56 → 3015.42] Like it's kind of part of the point, I think of these kinds of escapades.
[3016.06 → 3016.74] Some of them.
[3017.04 → 3019.48] This does just seem to be kind of chaotic.
[3019.86 → 3020.20] Yeah.
[3020.40 → 3023.60] I feel like they just want to hit everything they possibly can.
[3023.74 → 3024.18] Just do stuff.
[3024.36 → 3024.56] Yeah.
[3024.76 → 3028.82] Um, that is actively a way that people get, um, okay.
[3028.84 → 3030.12] Can we talk about the fire stick?
[3030.28 → 3030.60] Absolutely.
[3030.76 → 3032.60] What does the fire stick have to do with anything?
[3033.28 → 3039.00] I think it's just like, uh, they didn't have a computer.
[3039.46 → 3041.18] But they have a phone, which is a computer.
[3041.18 → 3042.82] Uh, why do they need the fire stick?
[3043.04 → 3043.96] I'm not entirely sure.
[3044.54 → 3046.14] It doesn't really seem like it goes out of the details.
[3046.14 → 3048.22] Allow them to infiltrate cloud computing services.
[3048.34 → 3049.40] What does that even mean?
[3050.32 → 3055.22] How do you, with a phone and a fire stick, how do you end up on Rockstar's slack?
[3055.92 → 3060.54] I mean, are, is this just social engineering, and we're, and we're just kind of sitting here
[3060.54 → 3062.86] in awe of the hacking greatness or is this?
[3063.02 → 3064.04] We're missing a lot of details.
[3064.58 → 3064.98] Surely.
[3065.44 → 3065.72] Yes.
[3065.72 → 3068.38] But it's pretty epic regardless.
[3068.68 → 3069.02] Yeah.
[3069.02 → 3072.84] I, uh, didn't he buy the phone with the hacked fire stick?
[3074.30 → 3076.20] Maybe it's, it's not in our notes.
[3076.40 → 3076.58] Yeah.
[3076.66 → 3078.72] Um, but it sounds pretty epic.
[3079.06 → 3079.74] This is.
[3079.74 → 3084.56] Oh, that would make sense if, if he used the fire stick to get the phone and then use the
[3084.56 → 3087.20] phone to actually, uh, to actually infiltrate them.
[3087.78 → 3093.02] Um, Captain Jin You over on float plane chat says, hi, I'm a cybersecurity SME for a living.
[3093.20 → 3095.02] This article sounds like nonsense.
[3095.02 → 3098.62] Uh, yeah, I think because our notes just have no information in them.
[3098.86 → 3099.02] Yeah.
[3099.02 → 3100.58] The original source is from the BBC.
[3100.94 → 3103.36] So I don't think this is actually nonsense.
[3105.44 → 3108.44] And here he is holding a shark.
[3108.56 → 3110.92] Wait, I still don't have a way to switch to my screen.
[3111.00 → 3111.50] Dang it, Luke.
[3112.48 → 3113.28] Uh, I'll show it.
[3113.32 → 3113.64] Are you ready?
[3113.86 → 3114.02] Yeah.
[3114.12 → 3114.52] Are you sure?
[3114.80 → 3114.98] Yeah.
[3116.86 → 3118.20] Because why not?
[3118.62 → 3118.88] Yeah.
[3119.16 → 3119.36] Sweet.
[3119.54 → 3121.22] Why not just be holding a shark?
[3121.22 → 3121.86] I guess.
[3125.02 → 3125.62] Yeah.
[3126.10 → 3126.70] All right.
[3126.82 → 3127.22] Anywho.
[3129.76 → 3132.20] He's been on three hacking sprees now.
[3132.54 → 3132.82] Epic.
[3133.10 → 3134.50] I spilled acid in my car.
[3135.52 → 3135.70] Yeah.
[3135.76 → 3135.98] Okay.
[3136.56 → 3136.96] What?
[3138.48 → 3141.20] Is this what you talked about before where it got under the floor mat?
[3141.36 → 3141.66] Yeah.
[3142.36 → 3142.74] Okay.
[3143.14 → 3143.58] So.
[3143.78 → 3144.42] How bad is it?
[3144.88 → 3149.32] When you have a pool, um, occasionally you need to adjust the pH.
[3149.32 → 3155.62] So there are chemicals that you'll put in the pool to either, uh, increase the pH or decrease
[3155.62 → 3156.24] the pH.
[3156.94 → 3162.14] And I, um, uh, one of those chemicals is, can be muriatic acid.
[3162.32 → 3166.90] And so we happened to have some muriatic acid kicking around here at the office.
[3166.90 → 3172.78] And the reason that we had a jug of it was, uh, do you remember that weird, like shoo
[3172.78 → 3175.78] that was all over the floor in some parts of the lab warehouse?
[3176.58 → 3178.16] Dan, did you see the shoo?
[3178.16 → 3178.80] Yes.
[3179.10 → 3179.28] Yes.
[3179.52 → 3179.76] Yeah.
[3179.86 → 3182.84] Did you guys ever figure out what we thought that was from?
[3183.00 → 3187.46] Like it was like, like it was thrown off of some kind of machine or something like that.
[3187.50 → 3188.12] Do you remember?
[3188.74 → 3189.36] Not exactly.
[3189.58 → 3195.06] I do remember that there was a floor polishing step and some shoo removal step and a whole
[3195.06 → 3196.98] bunch of ceiling steps and stuff like that.
[3197.00 → 3197.12] Yeah.
[3197.18 → 3198.42] I think Jamie had a theory.
[3198.42 → 3203.06] He, uh, he, he thought it was something to do with some kind of machine that was in that
[3203.06 → 3206.68] space and just like flung out glue or like some kind of.
[3206.90 → 3207.90] Oh, like preexisting.
[3208.16 → 3213.34] Uh, yeah, it was, yeah, it was from the, uh, it was from the previous, not even the previous
[3213.34 → 3216.54] tenants, but the ones before that was our, was our theory about it.
[3216.90 → 3222.44] Um, anyway, they, they had the idea that maybe they could try putting acid on it to try to
[3222.44 → 3223.54] make it a little bit easier to get up.
[3223.56 → 3224.40] It did absolutely nothing.
[3224.40 → 3227.82] So they just had this jug of acid, and I was like, Oh, I need acid.
[3228.60 → 3228.90] Hmm.
[3229.12 → 3232.02] Should I really be transporting acid in my car?
[3232.08 → 3236.60] That just seems like it's, it's got over 10,000 kilometres on it, but it still didn't
[3236.60 → 3237.76] have a single scratch.
[3237.94 → 3238.22] Yeah.
[3238.46 → 3240.76] Absolutely nothing like pristine.
[3240.76 → 3246.76] And, uh, I was like, do I really want, no, you know what?
[3246.80 → 3248.32] No, I'm not going to live my life like that.
[3248.32 → 3252.02] I'm not going to be like, Oh, you know, you know, my car is too nice to like to carry a bottle
[3252.02 → 3252.90] of acid or whatever.
[3252.90 → 3256.40] Okay.
[3257.04 → 3262.26] So the bottle of acid is in a bag just to make sure that just in case it, you know, spills
[3262.26 → 3265.78] or whatever, it spills into the bag instead of, you know, spilling out onto, you know,
[3265.82 → 3266.62] wherever it happens to be.
[3266.66 → 3270.42] But that bag is open because we opened the acid, and we were using it at some point.
[3270.54 → 3276.44] And I noted as I was making my way over to my car that, you know, the bag was, the bag
[3276.44 → 3279.66] was open and there was like kind of little bit of like wetness or something.
[3279.66 → 3280.98] And I was like, Oh, okay, but that's fine.
[3280.98 → 3284.34] Because I'll just put it in the back where it, where it will, where it will sit up without
[3284.34 → 3285.02] falling over.
[3285.54 → 3287.02] Um, and everything will be fine.
[3287.70 → 3292.74] As I was pulling into my driveway, I was thinking, man, yeah, it's, it's kind of crazy that, you
[3292.74 → 3296.98] know, given the state of my civic, like, do you remember riding around with me in that
[3296.98 → 3297.26] car?
[3298.66 → 3299.02] Yeah.
[3299.10 → 3300.02] Back when we first met?
[3300.22 → 3300.34] Yeah.
[3300.44 → 3300.80] Often.
[3301.16 → 3301.44] Yeah.
[3302.04 → 3303.80] It was in real, it was really well-kept.
[3303.94 → 3304.28] Oh yeah.
[3304.98 → 3306.38] Not full of garbage at all.
[3306.46 → 3307.24] No, no, no, no, no.
[3307.24 → 3307.46] Yeah.
[3307.46 → 3313.30] Um, so I was kind of marvelling at, you know, how people kind of change, you know, how,
[3313.30 → 3318.76] how you can go from having the actual trash mobile that is a rolling dumpster.
[3318.88 → 3323.06] I got so desensitized to it that I, I just, I had a conversation with Linus at some point
[3323.06 → 3326.52] in time where he just, he was just like, if it's in the if it's in the like passenger
[3326.52 → 3328.22] seat, it's just like not important.
[3328.88 → 3329.84] And I was like, okay.
[3329.94 → 3332.88] And I just stopped moving stuff out of the way, and I'll just sit on it.
[3332.88 → 3339.10] It's like an actual conversation and actual resolution that we had.
[3339.30 → 3344.08] So as I'm pulling into my driveway thinking like, yeah, man, I've, I even like, I even
[3344.08 → 3345.72] empty out my car when I arrive home now.
[3347.42 → 3351.56] Every time I pull out everything except a water bottle, my power ball, like a pen, some
[3351.56 → 3352.48] like tissues.
[3352.48 → 3356.72] Like I have like a loadout, and I'm pulling into my driveway, and I'm going, yeah, it's
[3356.72 → 3357.30] like kind of a minute.
[3357.30 → 3359.44] And then went, wait a minute.
[3359.44 → 3364.76] I had told myself when I got into the car, go easy on the accelerator.
[3364.96 → 3366.62] There's muriatic acid in the backseat.
[3368.92 → 3374.64] So I pull in, I get out, I open up the rear driver's side door.
[3375.80 → 3377.52] It is literally smoking.
[3378.40 → 3382.06] The floor mats are smoking.
[3382.06 → 3389.14] Um, fortunately not that much spilled and the way that it spilled, I have, I have like
[3389.14 → 3394.32] an all weather floor mats, and it spilled onto them and then kind of like, like surface tension
[3394.32 → 3395.06] over.
[3396.06 → 3402.84] So it's mostly under, but there's an area about this big where all the like carpet fuzz is
[3402.84 → 3405.46] completely, I don't know how to describe it.
[3405.50 → 3406.14] It's not melted.
[3406.14 → 3407.66] It's not burned.
[3408.12 → 3409.62] It's eaten.
[3410.54 → 3412.68] Uh, it's, it's completely eaten away.
[3412.80 → 3415.20] It looks, yeah, it looks absolutely disgusting.
[3415.58 → 3418.20] Fortunately, it was like really late.
[3418.26 → 3424.52] Uh, fortunately I kept my wits about me and instead of putting on soap and water, I ran
[3424.52 → 3426.64] and got baking soda and like, okay.
[3426.70 → 3426.98] Yeah.
[3427.14 → 3427.82] Sucked it on it.
[3427.82 → 3431.52] And it is like, like there was, there was a lot.
[3431.86 → 3432.90] It was pretty bad.
[3433.00 → 3434.00] But, um, anyway.
[3434.00 → 3435.34] Is it covered by the floor mat?
[3436.14 → 3439.54] I wish it was completely covered.
[3439.66 → 3440.28] It's like so close.
[3440.28 → 3440.98] Is there like a little bit?
[3441.04 → 3441.74] It's actually, it's.
[3441.74 → 3442.98] Is there anything you could do about it?
[3442.98 → 3443.70] It's actually okay.
[3443.88 → 3445.80] Could you do, could your arts and crafts repair this?
[3446.60 → 3447.12] Oh man.
[3447.40 → 3448.58] No, I'll show it to you after the show.
[3448.70 → 3449.80] Arts and crafts repair on.
[3449.80 → 3450.42] You're going to see it.
[3450.46 → 3452.04] You're going to be like, yeah, that was a dumb question.
[3453.04 → 3453.40] Okay.
[3453.62 → 3454.28] Yeah, it's terrible.
[3455.10 → 3455.42] Um.
[3457.18 → 3458.52] When it rains, it pours, you know?
[3459.52 → 3461.00] I spilled acid in my car.
[3461.72 → 3462.28] That's great.
[3462.28 → 3464.26] I dropped my phone in my pool.
[3466.14 → 3468.18] So these are obviously champagne problems.
[3468.18 → 3469.02] What can happen next?
[3469.12 → 3472.06] These are the most champagne problems that you can possibly have.
[3472.06 → 3476.56] But it doesn't change the fact that I spilled acid in my car and I dropped my phone in the pool.
[3476.90 → 3478.26] Well, I dropped myself in the pool.
[3478.52 → 3480.82] I actually have it on the surveillance footage too.
[3481.46 → 3481.96] So, Dan.
[3481.96 → 3483.64] Do you have your realization moment on the surveillance?
[3484.78 → 3485.14] Ooh.
[3485.14 → 3488.12] Because if so, that might be a good one.
[3488.16 → 3489.36] You said you're going to make a video for it.
[3489.60 → 3491.28] That might actually be a good thing to include in there.
[3491.40 → 3492.54] I don't know if I do.
[3492.66 → 3494.10] I might have been inside by that point.
[3494.26 → 3495.50] I'll have to check.
[3495.62 → 3498.46] But either way, I definitely have the moment when the AirPods.
[3498.50 → 3500.52] Oh, the good news is the AirPods survived.
[3501.90 → 3502.22] Great.
[3502.22 → 3508.52] So, I still have my AirPods Pros and all it cost me was a Galaxy Z Fold 3.
[3509.24 → 3510.00] Good trade.
[3510.18 → 3510.74] Good trade.
[3510.80 → 3511.62] I should play Monopoly.
[3511.88 → 3513.16] I'd be perfect at that game.
[3513.58 → 3516.16] Like, here, I've got Boardwalk.
[3516.30 → 3518.26] Can I trade it to you for the Baltic?
[3518.96 → 3520.28] Want to give me a railroad?
[3522.48 → 3524.06] Yeah, I actually really like the railroads.
[3524.80 → 3525.10] What?
[3525.48 → 3525.74] Yeah.
[3526.04 → 3526.46] They're pretty good.
[3526.46 → 3527.86] Oh, come on.
[3527.96 → 3529.46] I wouldn't trade it for Boardwalk.
[3529.46 → 3530.18] Boardwalk?
[3530.18 → 3530.46] Yeah.
[3531.00 → 3532.54] No, the railroads suck.
[3532.72 → 3533.02] No.
[3533.98 → 3534.38] They're okay.
[3534.50 → 3535.42] Okay, float, plane, pull.
[3537.40 → 3538.18] They're great.
[3538.72 → 3539.42] They're okay.
[3539.78 → 3540.26] They suck.
[3540.40 → 3540.82] Dan.
[3540.82 → 3541.22] Dan.
[3541.28 → 3542.24] What are the best ones?
[3542.46 → 3542.64] Dan.
[3542.64 → 3543.18] What are the best ones?
[3543.40 → 3544.28] It's not railroads.
[3544.36 → 3545.00] What are the best ones?
[3545.34 → 3545.90] Hold on.
[3545.92 → 3547.00] I want to hear from Dan first.
[3547.10 → 3547.34] Okay.
[3548.86 → 3551.48] What, like, the railroads or Boardwalk?
[3551.52 → 3552.56] No, no, just railroads.
[3552.84 → 3553.44] They're good.
[3553.44 → 3554.44] What do you think of railroads?
[3554.44 → 3554.96] They suck.
[3555.10 → 3555.50] They're mid.
[3555.68 → 3556.32] What are they?
[3556.62 → 3556.74] Mid.
[3556.74 → 3557.42] They're mid, yeah.
[3557.76 → 3558.70] Good early game?
[3559.46 → 3560.14] Week late game.
[3560.28 → 3560.48] Yeah.
[3561.02 → 3562.48] I think they're...
[3562.48 → 3564.70] I don't think they're great, but I think they're underrated.
[3564.70 → 3569.24] They're like a rush B, and then as you move into the late game, you know, you got your
[3569.24 → 3572.34] econ, and you're back and more stable, right?
[3572.34 → 3575.44] I don't know where the Counter-Strike references came from, but okay.
[3577.36 → 3579.04] Or is this Valorant?
[3579.18 → 3580.10] Did I just age myself?
[3580.46 → 3583.92] No, I mean, I was thinking, I don't know, Counter-Strike?
[3584.24 → 3584.92] Okay, cool.
[3584.92 → 3585.56] I don't know.
[3585.62 → 3586.58] It's very late.
[3586.72 → 3587.24] Give us the poll.
[3587.36 → 3588.10] All right, I'll make it.
[3588.10 → 3589.86] I want my screen sharing back.
[3590.04 → 3590.30] No.
[3590.50 → 3590.78] No.
[3591.78 → 3593.24] Did you just both say no?
[3594.46 → 3595.74] Did Dan also say no?
[3595.80 → 3596.36] I couldn't tell.
[3596.58 → 3598.74] You guys both spoke at the same time, I think.
[3599.66 → 3602.92] Okay, well, I have a Monopoly board up on my screen, so can I please screen share?
[3603.60 → 3603.84] Yeah.
[3604.14 → 3604.86] Jeez, you guys.
[3605.18 → 3606.40] I'm just going to steal your stream deck.
[3606.46 → 3608.10] Okay, so what do you think the best ones are?
[3608.30 → 3608.62] Okay.
[3608.62 → 3610.04] Because I have a pretty strong opinion on this.
[3610.04 → 3613.80] Yeah, the best ones are Baltic and Mediterranean.
[3615.68 → 3617.40] They are freaking OP.
[3617.86 → 3618.14] Okay.
[3618.36 → 3621.72] They cost, because remember too, okay, do you play Monopoly correctly?
[3623.72 → 3624.48] No one does.
[3624.48 → 3625.16] What a statement.
[3625.36 → 3626.22] No one does.
[3626.22 → 3633.80] What I'm trying to say is, when you build up your houses and your hotels, do you require
[3633.80 → 3640.38] players to have only at most N plus one on any of a given colour?
[3640.38 → 3640.46] Okay.
[3642.24 → 3645.58] You're not allowed to have a hotel on one and nothing on the other.
[3646.04 → 3648.44] Oh, within one colour band.
[3648.48 → 3648.64] Yeah.
[3648.74 → 3648.90] Yeah.
[3649.32 → 3649.68] Okay.
[3650.02 → 3655.74] So, what's so OP about the Baltic and Mediterranean is that you can build them up super early.
[3655.74 → 3656.06] Yeah.
[3656.30 → 3659.68] They cost freaking nothing, because houses are, I think, 50.
[3659.68 → 3662.88] And a lot of people don't necessarily want them, so you can get them.
[3663.02 → 3664.52] So, you can trade for them.
[3664.68 → 3668.50] So, then, after that, I am huge into right here.
[3669.44 → 3669.84] Okay.
[3669.84 → 3670.56] Love this.
[3670.86 → 3671.02] Yeah.
[3671.08 → 3672.74] All of this is just too expensive.
[3672.98 → 3673.16] Yes.
[3673.16 → 3678.82] And if you build up this stuff, this stuff, man, I love this zone.
[3679.04 → 3682.48] If you build up this stuff early, you're never going to get to the late game.
[3682.54 → 3683.92] There's never going to be a hotel on Boardwalk.
[3684.02 → 3684.68] I like Orange.
[3686.02 → 3686.42] Really?
[3686.60 → 3687.82] I was going to say I'm an Orange man, too.
[3687.82 → 3688.66] Orange is my favourite.
[3688.80 → 3689.00] Yeah.
[3689.70 → 3690.06] Okay.
[3690.06 → 3690.54] Yeah.
[3690.64 → 3694.32] I am definitely more of a Connecticut, Vermont, Oriental kind of guy.
[3695.08 → 3695.52] Yeah.
[3695.52 → 3696.16] Yeah.
[3696.16 → 3702.26] And then, I just, I love, I love this row because it's just so cheap.
[3702.44 → 3702.72] It's also.
[3703.06 → 3705.52] It'll, like, keep you floating very effectively.
[3705.74 → 3707.68] How did this turn into Monopoly strategy?
[3708.08 → 3708.44] Um.
[3708.68 → 3710.72] I'll never know how our show flows, but.
[3710.88 → 3711.06] Yeah.
[3711.12 → 3716.96] Well, maybe if you watched it once in a while, you know, then you could know why.
[3717.20 → 3717.44] What?
[3717.90 → 3718.40] I don't know.
[3718.50 → 3720.72] You used to watch the WAN show, so you could do the timestamps.
[3720.78 → 3721.40] You really liked it.
[3721.40 → 3721.88] Oh, no.
[3721.88 → 3722.64] Oh, man.
[3723.04 → 3724.16] That was the worst.
[3724.68 → 3728.18] Watching a show that you just spent the last two hours hosting.
[3728.52 → 3730.44] And watching it back immediately, too.
[3730.70 → 3734.14] There's no, like, nostalgic for something you said two hours ago.
[3734.34 → 3734.52] Yeah.
[3735.80 → 3737.38] What were we like back then?
[3739.04 → 3741.60] Do you remember when we talked about Monopoly strategy?
[3742.62 → 3744.20] Turns out kind of obnoxious.
[3744.84 → 3745.04] Okay.
[3745.10 → 3745.42] Hey!
[3745.54 → 3745.90] Okay.
[3746.62 → 3747.38] Oh, wow.
[3747.46 → 3748.72] You sound a lot less excited.
[3749.14 → 3750.18] What do you think of Railroads?
[3750.24 → 3751.76] Wait, you didn't even put Mid on there.
[3752.38 → 3752.62] Yeah.
[3753.18 → 3754.44] Way to fail the poll.
[3754.52 → 3755.24] Because they're just good.
[3756.80 → 3757.44] All right.
[3757.58 → 3763.14] I am getting outvoted 7 to 1 because Luke has a future career as a politician.
[3764.04 → 3766.12] Not because his takes are actually better.
[3766.20 → 3767.34] The Railroads suck.
[3767.64 → 3768.64] They don't suck.
[3768.86 → 3770.06] You're underrating them.
[3770.28 → 3771.34] They cost too much.
[3771.36 → 3772.36] You're underrating them.
[3772.38 → 3774.00] They have no scalability.
[3775.24 → 3776.58] Early game.
[3777.06 → 3777.62] Early game.
[3777.74 → 3778.30] Dead end.
[3779.44 → 3780.16] Dead end.
[3780.74 → 3781.14] I mean.
[3781.14 → 3782.32] I think they're underrated.
[3782.56 → 3787.94] Admittedly, it's better than collecting like $7 in rent off the Baltic or like whatever it works out to.
[3788.02 → 3789.32] It's like nothing if I recall correctly.
[3789.32 → 3790.00] Yeah, unless you get both of them.
[3790.32 → 3794.78] Like they're like guaranteed going to do okay.
[3795.04 → 3796.32] They're not going to win you the game.
[3796.44 → 3798.40] They're not going to do any of that kind of stuff.
[3800.70 → 3801.80] You're saying Baltic will?
[3802.10 → 3802.78] Yeah, Baltic and Mediterranean.
[3802.78 → 3803.98] Yeah, but you have to get both.
[3804.54 → 3805.36] You have to have both.
[3805.52 → 3805.76] Yeah.
[3805.76 → 3806.28] Yeah.
[3807.46 → 3809.42] I think the rent is actually less than $7.
[3809.68 → 3812.06] I think it's literally $2 on one of them or something like that.
[3812.14 → 3813.42] It's absolutely nothing.
[3814.02 → 3814.50] Can we get...
[3814.50 → 3815.22] Have they like...
[3815.22 → 3816.22] Have they interested?
[3816.56 → 3816.86] Like...
[3816.86 → 3816.92] Yeah.
[3817.92 → 3818.32] Yep.
[3818.40 → 3819.52] We were going exactly the same place.
[3819.84 → 3822.38] Is there a monopoly that keeps up with inflation?
[3824.04 → 3824.36] Yeah.
[3825.02 → 3825.50] I don't...
[3825.50 → 3826.22] I'm not sure.
[3826.22 → 3826.94] I kind of doubt it.
[3826.94 → 3827.50] I've seen memes.
[3827.62 → 3829.30] I've seen like millennial edition monopoly.
[3829.54 → 3830.92] You just like can't afford anything.
[3831.34 → 3832.60] Every single player loses.
[3833.00 → 3833.28] Yeah.
[3835.68 → 3842.14] All four of you, assuming you're playing a four-player game, have to like to bet your futures
[3842.14 → 3842.74] in crypto.
[3846.08 → 3848.28] So basically it's just Boggle then.
[3848.58 → 3849.14] Or Yankee.
[3849.20 → 3849.96] It's just Yankee.
[3849.96 → 3850.80] You just roll dice.
[3851.26 → 3851.46] Yeah.
[3852.12 → 3852.72] Oh man.
[3852.78 → 3855.64] Whoever gets the best dice roll wins.
[3855.64 → 3857.02] Oh, so horrible.
[3857.26 → 3857.54] Perfect.
[3857.72 → 3858.26] I love it.
[3858.38 → 3858.56] Yeah.
[3858.64 → 3858.82] Yeah.
[3858.82 → 3862.82] You can't buy any of the property, and you don't own anything, and you'll be happy about it.
[3863.02 → 3864.02] Dan, I have a complaint.
[3864.68 → 3864.98] Uh oh.
[3865.02 → 3865.22] Yeah.
[3865.48 → 3866.36] I need to issue a...
[3866.36 → 3867.46] I mean, this is the week to do it.
[3867.52 → 3868.02] A complaint.
[3869.62 → 3870.78] What can I do for you, sir?
[3870.90 → 3872.36] It's still on two more topics.
[3873.10 → 3875.82] You are, uh...
[3875.82 → 3878.10] 32 minutes ahead.
[3879.84 → 3880.20] What?
[3881.84 → 3883.50] Sponsors happens at 1 hour 32.
[3884.50 → 3884.82] Okay.
[3886.46 → 3887.60] Let's do sponsors now.
[3887.86 → 3888.14] Yeah.
[3890.26 → 3890.66] Okay.
[3891.06 → 3892.06] I want to shout out brand.
[3892.52 → 3895.04] Um, I don't think we have any talking points for them.
[3896.12 → 3896.82] Can I just see this?
[3896.98 → 3897.20] Yeah.
[3898.42 → 3899.90] Today's show is brought to you by brand.
[3900.26 → 3903.22] Um, basically says, don't sell anything.
[3903.70 → 3905.76] Don't worry about overpriced stickers.
[3905.76 → 3912.44] Um, you know, or, or, you know, FM Nintendo's, you know, Steam Deck cases or whatever else
[3912.44 → 3913.12] the case may be.
[3913.62 → 3920.54] Um, all they asked me to do is speak honestly and openly about the relationship that we've
[3920.54 → 3922.90] had as a creator slash brand.
[3922.90 → 3926.54] And I mean, I, I actually want to go a little bit deeper than that.
[3926.54 → 3933.94] I think that, um, um, it's a it's a relationship between our people and their, their people.
[3933.94 → 3936.04] Um, we meme a lot about brand.
[3936.16 → 3940.78] We talk about how, you know, like, yeah, those guys are, you know, whatever else they send
[3940.78 → 3945.36] me boxes of broken glass, like literally for real, um, that I am expected to dig through.
[3945.44 → 3947.16] They did at least give me gloves to their credit.
[3947.16 → 3957.42] Um, but the truth is that, um, brand has proven themselves time and time again as not a brand.
[3957.42 → 3959.10] Like I, I, I hate calling them a brand.
[3959.16 → 3961.24] They've obviously built an amazing brand.
[3961.64 → 3963.60] Um, but they're, they're, they're more than a brand.
[3963.60 → 3970.30] Um, and they've proven themselves time and time again to be a brand that doesn't just show up,
[3970.72 → 3974.50] give you a bag of money, expect you to sell a bunch of their crap and then call it a day.
[3974.50 → 3979.42] Like they, um, they, they've really worked with us deeply over the years when we are,
[3979.56 → 3984.82] when we're looking for advice with respect to, um, I mean, just about anything, you know,
[3984.84 → 3990.14] e-commerce, um, uh, when, when, you know, when we want to chat about, uh, I remember we had
[3990.14 → 3995.40] like a really, really cool conversation about just like how to handle, um, you know, holiday
[3995.40 → 3997.58] compensation and stuff like that.
[3997.58 → 4000.90] Like we, we, we talk about, I mean, just about anything and everything.
[4000.90 → 4004.24] Um, they're super, super cool folks over there.
[4004.24 → 4013.04] And I, uh, it means a lot to me that they were the ones that without even prompting, um,
[4013.04 → 4018.86] came to us and said, Hey, um, we know you guys, uh, we know what's up over there.
[4018.86 → 4025.60] We know, we know that you guys are going to come out of this, um, when it's time for the
[4025.60 → 4026.74] content to start up again.
[4026.74 → 4028.52] Uh, we want to be there.
[4028.62 → 4029.56] We want to be part of it.
[4029.74 → 4032.52] And, um, you know, that means a lot, right?
[4032.58 → 4038.40] I think it's, uh, there, there's a lot to be said, uh, you know, about the fun you can
[4038.40 → 4040.08] have with a fair weather friend, right?
[4040.08 → 4044.84] Like it's, it's cool to hang out or whatever, but, um, you know, when push comes to shove,
[4044.84 → 4050.90] you know, it's the deeper relationships that, that really matter.
[4050.90 → 4056.66] And I think brand has, um, really proven that they get us.
[4057.16 → 4060.96] Um, so yeah, they're the they're the sponsor of the show today and that's it.
[4061.06 → 4067.76] They, uh, yeah, really, really appreciate it.
[4067.90 → 4068.58] Thanks guys.
[4069.40 → 4072.70] Um, obviously you guys, you know, know who they are.
[4072.76 → 4075.12] They make, they make stickers for your devices.
[4075.12 → 4075.60] I'm sorry.
[4075.68 → 4077.32] I'm just old habits, right?
[4077.32 → 4081.86] I'm trying to jump back into trying to sell brand stickers or whatever, but like, okay.
[4081.92 → 4083.84] It literally says, don't do it.
[4083.88 → 4084.68] There's nothing to sell.
[4084.74 → 4085.36] So, okay, fine.
[4085.66 → 4086.06] Yeah.
[4086.10 → 4086.78] Thanks brand.
[4086.98 → 4089.82] Um, here's to good Lord.
[4090.70 → 4092.54] How many years have we been working together?
[4092.98 → 4094.38] I mean, since the Langley house.
[4094.72 → 4100.70] My favourite sponsor spot ever was still with brand back when they were just one of, you
[4100.70 → 4103.94] know, sticker companies back when their brand didn't have the same kind of strength.
[4103.94 → 4110.88] They didn't have like, you know, unique products that they invested real time and R and D into,
[4111.02 → 4113.56] you know, stuff like their dark plates for the PlayStation five and stuff like that.
[4113.94 → 4116.80] Um, so it's got to be at least eight years or something like that.
[4116.84 → 4121.70] So here's to, uh, here's to another eight guys.
[4121.84 → 4122.72] Thank you very much.
[4124.68 → 4125.32] All right.
[4126.70 → 4127.42] What's next?
[4127.48 → 4128.12] What do you want to talk about?
[4128.12 → 4128.44] Sorry.
[4128.54 → 4130.70] Google's our railroads, good and monopoly.
[4130.86 → 4132.40] Oh, and the monopoly.
[4132.40 → 4133.34] We're going back to this.
[4133.34 → 4138.12] The monopoly wiki says in summary, the railroads are perfect to own.
[4138.36 → 4142.26] They're a steady source of cash and can temporarily stop an opponent from building with all four
[4142.26 → 4142.82] of them together.
[4143.24 → 4149.32] Also their position being five squares in on each side makes it that one is always at risk
[4149.32 → 4150.62] of landing on a railroad.
[4152.98 → 4156.06] Also, there are chance cards that send people to them.
[4156.18 → 4158.04] The rent caps out at $200.
[4159.12 → 4160.98] Mad early game.
[4160.98 → 4164.68] Yeah, but early game, you're not going to have all four of them.
[4164.74 → 4165.62] It's 25 bucks.
[4165.76 → 4168.66] The wiki and the poll disagree with both of you.
[4168.76 → 4169.04] All right.
[4170.08 → 4172.60] Well, you didn't even give the poll a mid-option.
[4172.76 → 4174.14] You did Dan dirty there.
[4174.48 → 4175.48] Where's the rush B?
[4177.80 → 4180.52] Dan, you're making it really hard for me to defend you right now.
[4180.70 → 4181.48] Rush for bread.
[4181.48 → 4182.20] You're here.
[4185.32 → 4186.14] Oh my goodness.
[4186.14 → 4187.76] Apparently it's 400, not 200.
[4187.98 → 4188.10] Okay.
[4188.18 → 4188.94] So it's what is it?
[4188.98 → 4190.16] 50, 100, 200, 400.
[4190.62 → 4190.72] Okay.
[4191.40 → 4191.66] Okay.
[4191.86 → 4192.72] Doubles every time.
[4192.76 → 4193.28] I still don't like them.
[4193.28 → 4194.36] Look at that value.
[4194.68 → 4195.00] No one.
[4195.08 → 4195.78] You're never going to let.
[4196.00 → 4196.26] Look at that value.
[4196.26 → 4197.98] You are never going to land on all four of them.
[4198.48 → 4200.44] And no one's ever going to trade you all four of them.
[4201.02 → 4201.96] They'd have to be stupid.
[4201.96 → 4208.20] By the way, can I just say for a moment that there is one official rule of Monopoly that
[4208.20 → 4210.62] I think is completely brain-dead stupid.
[4210.62 → 4213.28] And I, I hate playing the game with it.
[4213.90 → 4220.68] Did you know that when you land on a property, if you have the money to buy it, you must buy
[4220.68 → 4220.90] it.
[4221.36 → 4221.84] Yeah.
[4222.04 → 4225.78] I'm pretty sure like everyone house rules that out because that's just like weird.
[4226.00 → 4231.82] That is it completely, it turns Monopoly the game of fairly.
[4231.96 → 4233.18] Minimal strategy.
[4233.48 → 4234.54] But technically some.
[4234.86 → 4239.42] Into Monopoly the game of literally predetermined outcomes.
[4239.76 → 4242.44] I think that was the point when the game was made though.
[4242.70 → 4243.10] Wasn't it?
[4243.60 → 4244.40] I don't know.
[4244.62 → 4248.10] I thought it was supposed to be an actual game where you can actually win.
[4250.00 → 4255.18] Now, if I remember correctly, the original creator was trying to, yeah, progressive writer
[4255.18 → 4260.14] Elizabeth Maggie Phillips created Monopoly in 1904 to teach players about the dangers of wealth
[4260.14 → 4260.76] concentration.
[4261.96 → 4262.24] Oh.
[4262.46 → 4267.40] Because one person just takes off and then obviously wins and everyone else goes bankrupt.
[4267.42 → 4269.12] So it was never meant to be a game.
[4269.28 → 4271.74] People are like, it's supposed to go to auction if you don't buy it.
[4271.78 → 4271.90] Okay.
[4271.96 → 4272.72] That I didn't know.
[4272.78 → 4274.32] Is that in every version of the rule book?
[4274.44 → 4274.76] I believe so.
[4274.76 → 4277.96] I thought it was, it goes to auction if you can't afford to buy it immediately.
[4278.32 → 4278.58] Yeah.
[4279.58 → 4279.82] Man.
[4279.90 → 4281.50] Now, what even is this show?
[4282.34 → 4283.14] It's the Monopoly show.
[4283.14 → 4284.12] I'm honestly not sure.
[4284.24 → 4284.40] Okay.
[4284.40 → 4287.48] When you land on an unowned property, you may buy that property from the bank at its printed
[4287.48 → 4287.76] price.
[4287.86 → 4289.22] You receive the title deed showing ownership.
[4289.38 → 4290.24] Place the title, blah, blah, blah.
[4290.30 → 4291.02] The bank sells through auction.
[4291.30 → 4291.50] Oh.
[4291.56 → 4294.68] If you do not wish to buy the property, the bank sells it through auction to the highest
[4294.68 → 4295.26] bidder.
[4296.10 → 4296.42] Okay.
[4296.62 → 4297.50] Can you bid on it?
[4297.50 → 4298.84] I did not know that.
[4300.22 → 4300.58] Interesting.
[4300.84 → 4303.52] I think the only, okay, I'm with, I'm with Raging Azar.
[4304.22 → 4307.02] I think the only rule of Monopoly is that you make your own rules.
[4307.38 → 4309.00] Apparently it isn't wealth concentration.
[4309.20 → 4311.82] It's land specifically, but owning land is wealth.
[4312.16 → 4312.56] Yeah.
[4312.62 → 4316.50] Wealth is like the oldest of wealth is a land is the oldest form of wealth.
[4316.74 → 4317.00] Yeah.
[4317.00 → 4317.94] As far as I can tell.
[4318.36 → 4324.22] Apparently, uh, they were specifically very into the land aspect, but that is like a huge
[4324.22 → 4327.16] portion of how people store their wealth.
[4327.16 → 4328.88] So I don't know.
[4331.52 → 4332.36] Gaming stream.
[4333.08 → 4334.24] We play Monopoly.
[4335.84 → 4344.04] So there's probably like some like PC version as like stupid animations and stuff.
[4344.38 → 4344.84] Oh yeah.
[4344.84 → 4348.60] I had a, I had a version of it for PC back in like the late nineties.
[4348.60 → 4350.10] It was actually like kind of awesome.
[4350.44 → 4354.50] You had these little like characters that were like, like run around the board.
[4354.58 → 4354.94] Oh man.
[4355.02 → 4355.22] Okay.
[4355.22 → 4356.16] Now I need to find it.
[4356.16 → 4358.58] Uh, Monopoly for windows.
[4358.96 → 4359.54] Oh my goodness.
[4359.62 → 4361.00] This might be like Windows 3.1.
[4361.88 → 4366.68] Um, Oh, I'm so excited about the nostalgia of looking at this image now.
[4368.22 → 4373.60] I think this might've been the one I had Monopoly deluxe for DOS.
[4373.60 → 4375.40] Extreme Monopoly.
[4375.40 → 4375.94] Extreme Monopoly.
[4375.94 → 4379.16] I do need my screen share button.
[4379.46 → 4379.72] Nope.
[4380.66 → 4381.62] Do you want to show something?
[4381.72 → 4382.04] Are you ready?
[4383.26 → 4388.72] I would respectfully request to have my screen share button back.
[4389.00 → 4389.18] Nope.
[4390.10 → 4390.50] Um.
[4390.50 → 4391.20] Not until next week.
[4391.20 → 4393.82] Not until next week.
[4393.82 → 4394.22] Yep.
[4394.92 → 4397.42] I cannot find exactly the one.
[4397.48 → 4405.30] It turns out there are a fricking ton of like abandoned wear or like old versions of Monopoly.
[4405.48 → 4407.02] Conrad saying Monopoly Tycoon.
[4408.66 → 4410.82] What is Monopoly Tycoon?
[4410.96 → 4411.78] I have no idea.
[4411.90 → 4413.04] That sounds redundant.
[4413.50 → 4414.76] It kind of does.
[4415.88 → 4416.96] Monopoly Tycoon.
[4417.42 → 4418.88] Wait, this is on Google play.
[4418.88 → 4418.96] Okay.
[4418.96 → 4420.02] Okay.
[4421.20 → 4427.62] Monopoly Tycoon is a management construction and management simulation PC game.
[4427.72 → 4428.06] I don't.
[4428.20 → 4429.22] Is this the same thing?
[4430.48 → 4430.88] What?
[4432.66 → 4434.38] I might've had this one.
[4435.90 → 4439.02] Uh, maybe it was this one from Hasbro.
[4440.48 → 4441.38] I'm not sure.
[4441.48 → 4441.58] Okay.
[4441.62 → 4442.02] Well, I'm not.
[4442.16 → 4443.70] It's the Monopoly RTS.
[4444.00 → 4445.02] What is happening?
[4445.54 → 4446.66] What is this?
[4446.88 → 4450.94] Monopoly Tycoon is like not normal Monopoly, but it's definitely still.
[4451.20 → 4453.48] The Monopoly like universe?
[4453.48 → 4456.18] Are you going to share your screen or is nobody allowed to share screens now?
[4456.18 → 4456.22] What the heck?
[4456.22 → 4456.68] No, no, no.
[4456.68 → 4457.14] It's cool.
[4457.24 → 4457.58] Let's go.
[4457.58 → 4457.80] Oh, what?
[4457.84 → 4459.02] This is like a mobile app?
[4459.36 → 4459.72] Uh.
[4459.72 → 4461.94] Oh, mine's like not plugged in.
[4464.36 → 4465.96] Where did my cord even go?
[4467.06 → 4468.30] So that was my version.
[4468.48 → 4469.48] Oh, wow.
[4469.88 → 4472.02] Look, if I can't have it, neither can anyone.
[4473.32 → 4474.34] Goes on the other side.
[4474.70 → 4475.80] I didn't even take that.
[4475.86 → 4477.20] I actually just was fidgeting.
[4477.36 → 4478.56] I did not do that on purpose.
[4478.56 → 4479.32] That's hilarious.
[4479.56 → 4480.22] That's hilarious.
[4480.22 → 4481.94] I did not test them before the show.
[4483.06 → 4483.26] Ugh.
[4484.04 → 4484.30] Ugh.
[4485.26 → 4485.58] Okay.
[4485.90 → 4486.26] Letting it freak out for a second.
[4486.26 → 4488.20] Yeah, it might have been Monopoly Deluxe for PC.
[4488.34 → 4489.34] I'm honestly not sure.
[4491.48 → 4492.16] There we go.
[4492.82 → 4493.22] Yeah.
[4493.42 → 4494.16] This is it.
[4498.34 → 4499.80] It's like actually a different game.
[4501.02 → 4501.38] Okay.
[4501.52 → 4502.84] So it's more of a tycoon game.
[4503.06 → 4506.04] It's like Roller Coaster Tycoon inspired, but Monopoly?
[4506.28 → 4507.46] I'm taking it.
[4508.30 → 4508.98] You know, fun fact.
[4511.20 → 4517.46] Roller Coaster Tycoon is the tycoon game that basically everybody cites as like the tycoon game.
[4517.46 → 4518.42] Yeah, because it's the best one.
[4519.12 → 4520.36] It's not the first one.
[4520.88 → 4521.32] Okay.
[4522.32 → 4528.40] The first tycoon game that I'm aware of, and there might be other ones, is Dino Park Tycoon.
[4528.40 → 4535.36] I was first introduced to this in, I think, either grade two or grade three.
[4535.90 → 4539.94] We had it on like, man, oh, I'm going to be dating myself a little bit here.
[4540.78 → 4545.42] It was installed on like a handful of the computers in our computer lab.
[4546.28 → 4553.70] Was your school like that, where not all the computers had the same software because the school could only afford licenses for a certain number of computers?
[4553.70 → 4559.18] So sometimes you'd end up stuck on one of the bad computers, and you'd be playing like typing tutor games.
[4559.30 → 4566.92] And then other times you would get on one of the ones with Math Circus or with Dino Park Tycoon was the most purely video game one.
[4567.06 → 4569.72] So everyone always wanted to play Dino Park Tycoon.
[4569.84 → 4575.80] And I love this game so much that I bought, or I asked my parents, obviously.
[4575.88 → 4577.06] I was like seven.
[4577.06 → 4580.20] So I got a version of it that I could play at home.
[4580.92 → 4584.08] And it sucks.
[4584.94 → 4586.56] It's like actually a bad game.
[4586.92 → 4594.08] No matter what you do, the Dino Park eventually just nobody comes to it.
[4594.38 → 4595.72] Like you max out everything.
[4596.04 → 4599.06] And then it just gets to the point where nobody comes and there's no reason.
[4599.28 → 4601.24] And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.
[4601.24 → 4603.48] Is there an earlier Tycoon games?
[4604.32 → 4605.44] Earlier Tycoon game?
[4605.60 → 4606.52] Rollercoaster Tycoon.
[4608.28 → 4612.28] So Sawyer, I believe is the last name of the developer for it.
[4612.52 → 4616.54] Wrote 99% of the code for Rollercoaster Tycoon in an assembly code.
[4617.56 → 4618.64] I was going to ask if you knew that.
[4618.98 → 4620.30] That is my favourite fact.
[4620.50 → 4622.74] Batman is a genius.
[4623.88 → 4626.20] Rollercoaster Tycoon was like solo dev'd, right?
[4626.68 → 4630.20] As far as my understanding goes, it was solo dev'd or at least extremely close to it.
[4630.20 → 4633.82] But there was an artist, a separate artist, Simon Foster.
[4635.20 → 4640.28] But yeah, Sawyer did the development, and it was in assembly code.
[4640.44 → 4643.72] So it ran like incredibly efficiently and on like everything.
[4644.70 → 4649.64] I don't think Dino Park Tycoon is actually related to the Tycoon series.
[4650.00 → 4657.60] The first Tycoon game in this Wikipedia list of business simulation games is Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon.
[4657.60 → 4664.30] I do not know if that is a similar style of game though.
[4665.80 → 4669.72] Build and manage a railroad company by laying tracks, building stations, and buying and scheduling trains.
[4669.80 → 4674.52] Okay, that really doesn't really sound like the same kind of thing as Rollercoaster Tycoon.
[4675.26 → 4676.06] Transport Tycoon?
[4676.06 → 4680.38] I thought, okay, I got to tell you guys, I thought Tycoon was like TM.
[4682.02 → 4685.36] I thought that that was a series.
[4686.12 → 4689.06] But Railroad Tycoon doesn't come along until...
[4689.68 → 4690.98] Hold on, where is Railroad Tycoon?
[4691.34 → 4692.30] Oops, sorry, Railroad.
[4693.22 → 4694.10] Rollercoaster Tycoon.
[4694.48 → 4698.98] Rollercoaster Tycoon doesn't roll around until 1999.
[4698.98 → 4707.06] So preceding that was Railroad Tycoon from Microprose in 1990.
[4707.64 → 4713.06] Dino Park Tycoon from MECC Manley & Associates, whoever they are, in 1993.
[4713.94 → 4715.66] Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon Deluxe.
[4715.72 → 4716.76] Okay, I'm not really going to count that.
[4717.12 → 4720.78] Pizza Tycoon from Software 2000 in 1994.
[4721.18 → 4722.04] Pizza Tycoon.
[4722.46 → 4725.18] Transport Tycoon, which is Chris Sawyer.
[4725.18 → 4728.68] Wait, I want to play Transport Tycoon now.
[4729.86 → 4737.86] So he actually did a Tycoon game before Rollercoaster Tycoon.
[4737.86 → 4740.32] Transport Tycoon is 10 out of 10 on Steam.
[4740.94 → 4741.84] Overwhelmingly positive.
[4742.82 → 4744.14] Yeah, that's the one I was going to mention.
[4744.34 → 4745.22] Open TTD.
[4746.92 → 4749.26] Well, if you ever game stream again...
[4749.26 → 4750.86] We're going to play Open TTD?
[4751.00 → 4752.68] I think we found you a game to play.
[4752.72 → 4753.44] Is this multiplayer?
[4753.44 → 4755.12] To start building a transport...
[4755.12 → 4757.22] It has online PVP?
[4757.78 → 4758.40] Oh, yeah.
[4758.40 → 4758.72] What is that?
[4758.72 → 4762.76] Because you're a business, and you have to compete with other towns.
[4763.00 → 4763.82] Like you're the mayor of some town.
[4763.82 → 4767.34] Okay, you sound like you're speaking fairly authoritatively.
[4767.38 → 4768.12] Have you played this game?
[4768.30 → 4768.94] Yeah, yeah.
[4769.14 → 4769.98] It's a good game?
[4770.42 → 4771.22] It is.
[4771.34 → 4772.12] Dude, it has...
[4772.12 → 4775.04] Way beyond my understanding to play effectively.
[4775.18 → 4775.80] A lot of depth?
[4776.22 → 4777.10] It's very deep.
[4777.10 → 4783.78] And there's like boat routes and trains and like buses and all sorts of weird resource management.
[4784.24 → 4786.84] It's basically better Anna.
[4788.10 → 4789.56] But for different reasons.
[4790.56 → 4792.90] Those are big words.
[4793.28 → 4794.54] I just wanted to upset Linus.
[4794.54 → 4796.00] Those are very big words.
[4796.00 → 4803.56] Because the all-time, all reviews on Steam are over 10,000 are overwhelmingly positive.
[4804.16 → 4806.00] Well, not all 10,000 of them are.
[4806.22 → 4810.68] But there are over 10,000 all-time reviews and their average is overwhelmingly positive.
[4810.86 → 4814.10] And the recent reviews are also overwhelmingly positive.
[4814.48 → 4814.74] Sick.
[4814.74 → 4815.14] Sick.
[4815.68 → 4816.08] Awesome.
[4816.28 → 4817.60] I've heard of this before.
[4818.40 → 4821.68] I don't believe this has anything to do with Sawyer anymore.
[4821.98 → 4824.56] This is like kind of open source-y thing, I think?
[4825.42 → 4826.18] I think so.
[4826.42 → 4827.34] It's a kind of...
[4827.34 → 4830.06] It's a different game than like a lot of other stuff.
[4830.48 → 4833.00] I wouldn't even necessarily classify it as a game.
[4834.08 → 4836.10] So much as...
[4836.10 → 4841.08] Like how do you win at business in a game like this?
[4841.14 → 4843.52] I think you have to have like set rules, right?
[4843.52 → 4845.64] You can't just kind of vibe with it.
[4847.04 → 4847.48] Right.
[4847.80 → 4848.04] Yeah.
[4848.10 → 4850.86] You can't just kind of have a system and let it live.
[4851.00 → 4852.78] That's kind of how Anna is, right?
[4853.14 → 4853.50] Yeah.
[4853.76 → 4856.54] I think Anna is kind of a different beast.
[4857.56 → 4864.06] I know if Linus likes Anna, he may enjoy this, but maybe wouldn't get the same from it that he does Anna.
[4864.16 → 4867.96] I think a big part of why I like Anna so much is just that I like played the first one as a kid.
[4868.64 → 4871.84] I don't know that it's the kind of game that I would get into today.
[4871.84 → 4873.84] Even though I could still obviously...
[4874.56 → 4882.80] I have heard every two-hour warning that you should probably stop playing to the point where they stop being unique.
[4883.04 → 4886.48] I think that happens at 10 hours of consecutive play.
[4886.96 → 4888.30] Like I do.
[4888.50 → 4890.22] That's a tough game to play for 10 hours.
[4890.22 → 4895.16] I like Anna the same way that like a coke head likes cocaine.
[4895.34 → 4897.62] Like it's not just liking it.
[4898.32 → 4902.22] I haven't played in quite a while because it's one of those things that I just I get into, and I'm just like...
[4903.04 → 4905.24] I still have the notes from our save.
[4906.02 → 4906.42] Oh yeah.
[4906.52 → 4907.06] I mean...
[4907.06 → 4908.46] We could pick it up at some point.
[4908.54 → 4909.72] I don't know if it's a good idea.
[4910.64 → 4911.02] I am...
[4911.02 → 4912.00] You mentioned streaming.
[4912.14 → 4914.56] I am fully still planning on streaming Starfield.
[4914.56 → 4918.86] Dino Park Tycoon was apparently the Oregon Trail developer.
[4919.66 → 4919.96] Oh.
[4920.84 → 4921.20] Yeah.
[4921.46 → 4922.90] Played the heck out of that game at school.
[4923.44 → 4925.64] Did you ever play the like Canadian version?
[4925.78 → 4926.36] The Yukon Trail?
[4928.14 → 4928.58] Wait.
[4928.66 → 4930.50] I think that might actually be what we had.
[4930.62 → 4930.84] Yeah.
[4930.96 → 4933.56] See as a young Canadian lad...
[4934.56 → 4936.36] I don't remember...
[4936.36 → 4938.42] I don't remember when I had this experience.
[4938.42 → 4943.52] But I was conversing with someone, and I was like, yeah, yeah, like Yukon Trail.
[4943.74 → 4946.84] And they're like, the f*** are you talking about?
[4947.02 → 4948.62] I'm like, yeah, like Yukon Trail.
[4948.78 → 4949.42] You know, you...
[4949.42 → 4952.78] Okay, so I definitely played Yukon Trail.
[4953.22 → 4956.54] You're on the frontier and you, you know, baby dysentery.
[4956.72 → 4959.56] And they're like, you mean Oregon Trail?
[4959.66 → 4961.14] I'm like, what's Oregon?
[4961.44 → 4961.96] Yukon Trail.
[4962.04 → 4962.86] Yeah, Yukon Trail.
[4962.86 → 4964.36] I played both of these for sure.
[4964.60 → 4964.76] Yeah.
[4964.76 → 4968.74] Okay, hold on.
[4968.82 → 4969.32] Hold on a second.
[4969.82 → 4970.46] Yeah, see?
[4970.70 → 4973.28] The chat's like, Yukon Trail, that's a thing?
[4975.38 → 4976.62] Yeah, no, come on.
[4976.96 → 4978.02] Yukon Trail is totally a thing.
[4978.08 → 4978.54] Okay, hold on.
[4978.56 → 4979.56] I think we need another float plane.
[4979.68 → 4980.62] Another float plane pull.
[4981.86 → 4982.40] Let's see.
[4982.54 → 4983.66] How do you do pulls?
[4984.22 → 4985.94] I should really know this.
[4986.04 → 4987.44] Just go to the player page.
[4987.84 → 4989.40] Oh, it's on the player page.
[4989.40 → 4990.58] I never have the player page open.
[4990.74 → 4994.40] To the right of the title, all the way across, there's a little like...
[4994.76 → 4996.64] Bar Chart icon.
[4997.56 → 4998.14] Click on that.
[4998.26 → 4998.94] Right at the title.
[4999.00 → 4999.30] Oh!
[5000.28 → 5001.30] Why is it there?
[5001.62 → 5001.96] I don't know.
[5002.04 → 5002.52] Where do you want it?
[5002.68 → 5003.10] I don't know.
[5003.12 → 5003.64] In the chat.
[5004.60 → 5005.36] It doesn't matter.
[5005.48 → 5006.72] Leave it where it is.
[5007.10 → 5007.38] Okay.
[5007.66 → 5008.12] Sounds good.
[5009.82 → 5010.78] Best Trail.
[5012.30 → 5012.66] Yukon.
[5013.64 → 5014.00] Oregon.
[5014.52 → 5014.92] All right.
[5015.26 → 5015.66] Duration.
[5016.02 → 5017.60] Let's give them two minutes.
[5018.48 → 5018.88] Okay.
[5019.02 → 5019.76] The poll's live.
[5019.90 → 5022.12] I want to know which one's the right trail.
[5022.74 → 5023.10] Really?
[5023.40 → 5024.52] It's going to get slaughtered.
[5024.52 → 5028.68] Oh, but you can get the gold.
[5029.48 → 5031.46] What about the gold in the Yukon?
[5031.84 → 5032.80] It's a gold rush.
[5034.12 → 5035.98] Jaden said it's also in the creator panel.
[5036.96 → 5037.44] Okay.
[5038.30 → 5039.16] Thanks, Jaden.
[5041.32 → 5043.86] Everything that I cherished as a child was being crushed.
[5043.86 → 5053.72] By the way, I want to give a shout-out for Jaden because Jaden launched a very cool feature during our we're not launching videos phase.
[5054.94 → 5056.18] Is he supposed to be doing that?
[5056.38 → 5056.88] The new...
[5056.88 → 5057.14] Yeah.
[5059.04 → 5059.64] What do you mean?
[5060.38 → 5062.24] I thought people weren't supposed to be like...
[5062.24 → 5065.02] I mean, I guess the dev team really didn't have anything to do with any of this.
[5065.12 → 5065.58] We were good.
[5066.20 → 5066.56] All right.
[5066.60 → 5066.88] Fair enough.
[5066.98 → 5067.20] We're good.
[5067.30 → 5068.36] You do your thing with your team.
[5068.48 → 5071.68] The thing that we needed to do was keep advancing the platform, which is what we were doing.
[5072.50 → 5073.62] And there's a new player.
[5074.24 → 5075.46] There's a new player on Float plane.
[5075.58 → 5076.24] And it's very cool.
[5076.38 → 5076.92] You should check it out.
[5077.24 → 5077.84] It looks nice.
[5077.84 → 5085.76] I think a lot of people didn't notice because the visual path that the player went down is kind of in line with what you'd expect.
[5086.20 → 5087.74] But if you go look at it, it is different.
[5087.84 → 5092.70] The old version was kind of like a bar that would fill as it went across.
[5092.80 → 5096.52] Are you going to share your screen or are you just going to be like that for the entire rest of the show?
[5096.60 → 5098.06] No, I'm just going to describe it.
[5098.06 → 5098.90] No, he's going to share his screen.
[5100.36 → 5100.82] I mean...
[5100.82 → 5101.34] There we go.
[5101.34 → 5105.28] Why show a video when you could just describe the video?
[5106.14 → 5106.62] This is it.
[5107.04 → 5107.24] Yeah.
[5107.84 → 5108.30] And it's cool.
[5108.52 → 5109.52] And it's React now.
[5110.38 → 5112.48] Why don't you explain what is being React means?
[5112.48 → 5115.96] There's dark mode in the live chat now, as you guys can see on the right here.
[5116.56 → 5116.68] Ooh.
[5117.36 → 5118.14] Like on 5, though.
[5118.20 → 5119.34] Why does it matter that it's React?
[5120.54 → 5125.26] So we are trying to convert everything to React.
[5126.64 → 5129.68] We've been in Angular for a long time, so it's a framework we've been using.
[5130.46 → 5132.46] And on the front end, we're trying to convert to React.
[5133.08 → 5137.40] The state that our Angular was in was, you know, not great.
[5137.40 → 5139.52] And also, I don't know.
[5139.62 → 5142.22] There's just long conversation, but there are reasons why we wanted to move to React.
[5142.46 → 5148.44] The development time for something like the live chat improvements that happened a little while ago.
[5148.44 → 5153.36] If I remember correctly, we had spec'd that out at...
[5153.36 → 5154.12] I'm going to forget.
[5154.38 → 5154.96] I apologize.
[5155.22 → 5156.78] It was like five weeks or something.
[5156.78 → 5161.20] And then it was Rectified instead of left in Angular.
[5161.36 → 5165.62] And I think it took Jayden like two days or three days or something.
[5166.14 → 5172.22] So site should react a little better when you load it and use it.
[5172.66 → 5177.14] And also, it's faster, easier to develop, all that jazz.
[5177.66 → 5180.42] We're moving off of Angular, moving to React.
[5180.52 → 5180.80] Okay.
[5180.92 → 5181.32] That is good.
[5181.32 → 5184.16] There is not that much left on the user-facing portion.
[5184.34 → 5186.10] We split the site into three sections.
[5187.66 → 5192.10] There's now user-facing portion, creator-facing portion, and admin portion.
[5193.02 → 5198.76] And there's not that much left to get the user-facing portion to have the Angular wrapper removed from it.
[5198.94 → 5200.24] So it will be all React soon.
[5200.24 → 5201.28] Now tell me this.
[5201.78 → 5205.12] How much truth is there in this message in Twitch chat?
[5205.38 → 5207.30] It's Twitch chat, so it's probably wrong.
[5207.54 → 5213.20] But React is the next framework until another new hotness comes out, and you just port the entire project to yet another framework.
[5213.34 → 5214.38] Hashtag just dev things.
[5214.82 → 5215.24] Are we just going to...
[5215.80 → 5215.98] Oh.
[5216.64 → 5217.08] HTML?
[5218.70 → 5219.14] Yeah.
[5220.08 → 5221.18] Yeah, we already have...
[5221.18 → 5221.62] Welcome to the internet.
[5221.70 → 5222.86] We already have another one.
[5223.52 → 5224.72] React is like old.
[5225.08 → 5225.90] What are you doing, Luke?
[5226.26 → 5226.94] React's not that old.
[5227.24 → 5227.80] React's still good.
[5228.06 → 5228.78] I know, I know.
[5228.78 → 5229.78] It is...
[5229.78 → 5232.40] I think we are getting to the point there were some people are like,
[5232.58 → 5234.94] I've been working in React for a while.
[5234.98 → 5235.78] I want something new.
[5236.42 → 5238.38] New shiny toys.
[5238.40 → 5240.56] So we're a little slow on this movement for sure.
[5240.92 → 5241.12] But...
[5241.12 → 5241.48] I see.
[5241.68 → 5242.90] That is sort of...
[5242.90 → 5243.64] Yeah, I don't know.
[5243.74 → 5244.76] Hey, it has theatre mode now, though.
[5245.24 → 5245.46] Yep.
[5245.98 → 5247.06] Show the people theatre mode, maybe?
[5247.58 → 5247.98] Yeah.
[5248.28 → 5250.40] Maybe we just won't share screens because that's not cool anymore.
[5250.40 → 5253.64] Well, people should just go use it for themselves and then comment on it and stuff.
[5255.04 → 5255.40] Yeah.
[5256.40 → 5256.76] Yeah.
[5256.76 → 5258.70] No, you should show the people theatre mode.
[5258.78 → 5259.88] They can't find the button.
[5260.18 → 5261.26] You can't even see your screen.
[5261.40 → 5261.82] What do you mean?
[5261.90 → 5262.34] Yeah, hold on.
[5262.40 → 5263.60] Totally unprofessional show.
[5263.78 → 5264.18] The worst.
[5264.86 → 5265.56] Worst show.
[5266.16 → 5266.48] When show?
[5266.56 → 5269.66] More like when to not watch it show.
[5270.22 → 5271.66] Okay, now I got to get rid of this.
[5272.80 → 5274.02] You don't have to do anything.
[5274.14 → 5274.60] We could...
[5274.60 → 5275.56] Oh, crap.
[5275.56 → 5276.80] We're supposed to be doing merch messages.
[5278.02 → 5280.78] Dan, while Luke figures out his stuff...
[5280.78 → 5282.18] By the way, Yukon Trail lost.
[5282.52 → 5285.68] So, yeah, I'm really disappointed in actually everyone right now.
[5286.18 → 5287.90] Dan, do you want to hit me with a couple merch messages?
[5288.08 → 5288.78] Sure, sure, sure, sure.
[5289.58 → 5290.38] Hi, DLL.
[5290.70 → 5292.52] The correct acronym.
[5292.96 → 5296.36] Depending on how the stubby goes, any thoughts on something in between?
[5296.54 → 5298.72] Normal handle with a short shaft.
[5299.20 → 5302.98] The normal handle with a stubby shaft.
[5302.98 → 5310.62] I think that you, sir, are a niche user.
[5312.58 → 5313.06] Hacksaw.
[5313.34 → 5314.48] That's a good way to answer that.
[5314.64 → 5319.84] Yeah, no, Dan, can you please not give the people really, terrible advice?
[5320.20 → 5327.26] There is literally nowhere on the shaft of the screwdriver that they could cut that would retain the bit holder.
[5327.52 → 5330.24] Buy a stubby and a normal one and transplant.
[5330.24 → 5330.48] Buy it.
[5331.06 → 5333.82] No, no, that is actually not recommended either.
[5335.02 → 5335.92] Here, hold on.
[5336.02 → 5336.26] Wait, wait.
[5336.92 → 5339.30] Yeah, we don't have anything planned for that right now.
[5340.12 → 5341.54] Hey, theatre mode.
[5341.60 → 5343.02] And the chat is still there.
[5343.14 → 5343.50] Cool.
[5344.08 → 5344.44] Yay.
[5345.12 → 5346.52] Yeah, good job, Flow Play team.
[5346.90 → 5348.96] It's called fill window, but yeah.
[5349.06 → 5349.96] And there's a keyboard macro.
[5350.22 → 5350.42] W.
[5351.48 → 5351.92] Cool.
[5353.04 → 5353.66] There we go.
[5354.66 → 5354.98] Okay.
[5355.18 → 5356.62] Oh, that did a bunch of the...
[5356.62 → 5357.22] That makes sense.
[5357.48 → 5357.84] Cool.
[5357.84 → 5361.82] Hey, Linus, a belated birthday wish to you.
[5362.14 → 5366.76] Have you gotten a chance to celebrate turning 37 amidst everything that's been happening?
[5367.04 → 5368.30] And how did your birthday go?
[5368.80 → 5370.56] Yeah, I went camping, which I hate.
[5370.90 → 5372.32] But my kids really enjoyed it.
[5372.60 → 5374.84] And Dennis and Colton came out, which was pretty cool.
[5374.84 → 5382.90] We had an extra campsite because it's really hard to get campsites at provincial parks in BC.
[5383.32 → 5390.20] Like, you basically have to get up at 7 a.m., which, bless my wife, she did, because she's amazing.
[5390.50 → 5392.96] But she managed to get not one, but two.
[5393.44 → 5398.18] And because she had the opportunity to get two, she grabbed them because, like, yeah, then we could invite people to come with us.
[5398.18 → 5403.16] So we were up there with some friends, some family, and also Dennis and Colton came.
[5403.22 → 5404.02] We had some buggies.
[5405.10 → 5405.98] Went to the beach.
[5406.24 → 5407.00] Well, the lake.
[5407.16 → 5408.10] The beach on the lake.
[5408.62 → 5411.30] The rocks near the edge of the lake.
[5411.76 → 5413.74] Okay, it's not much of a beach, but it's definitely a lake.
[5414.88 → 5416.14] And, yeah, yeah, we hung out.
[5416.20 → 5416.56] It was good.
[5416.56 → 5420.30] Jaden says that he wants the stubby handle with the long shaft.
[5421.46 → 5423.68] That seems at least more likely.
[5423.68 → 5424.78] I can actually kind of see that.
[5424.78 → 5426.54] Yeah, I could kind of see that.
[5426.62 → 5429.92] But the big handle with the little tiny shaft is...
[5429.92 → 5431.00] That's a little weird.
[5431.00 → 5438.70] Yeah, it's one that I can't say that I can imagine that.
[5445.04 → 5446.20] It's really late.
[5446.56 → 5447.56] Oh, yeah.
[5447.92 → 5450.38] It's actually been an incredibly taxing week.
[5450.38 → 5452.30] I was going to say, Ed, it's been a heck of a week.
[5452.88 → 5453.10] Yeah.
[5453.88 → 5454.56] Oh, man.
[5461.14 → 5462.10] People are confused.
[5462.30 → 5462.74] Buggies.
[5463.04 → 5463.84] Like, snakes.
[5464.92 → 5465.28] Dinkies?
[5466.72 → 5467.60] Yeah, I got it.
[5467.62 → 5468.28] Yeah, buggies.
[5468.40 → 5468.56] Yeah.
[5469.60 → 5470.38] Yes, burgers.
[5472.64 → 5474.06] Apparently, it's late for everyone.
[5474.06 → 5476.84] Dan, you want to name me one more?
[5476.92 → 5477.50] Yeah, what do we get?
[5477.60 → 5478.26] Sure, sure, sure.
[5478.34 → 5478.96] I got one left.
[5479.32 → 5480.80] Looking forward to you guys moving forward.
[5481.02 → 5483.90] Any tech changes to improve production workflow?
[5484.16 → 5490.48] I got to tell you, the thing about tech changes is that they typically add work as opposed to actually eliminating work.
[5490.48 → 5498.44] There are times when, in the longer term, tech changes can help to lighten your workload.
[5498.56 → 5502.94] I think a perfect example of that would be the Black magic Ultimate that we added for Game linked.
[5502.94 → 5507.24] But to get it to that point was a ton of work.
[5507.78 → 5518.40] And so because this week was really focused on hammering out human challenges, you know, figuring out communication and process building,
[5518.40 → 5531.30] we were not really looking for excuses to play around with more tech toys and find ways to integrate them into a workflow that already really needed some TLC.
[5532.54 → 5534.76] So, no, in short.
[5535.54 → 5535.66] Yeah.
[5536.92 → 5537.70] All right.
[5538.58 → 5539.70] A couple more topics.
[5539.74 → 5540.38] What do you want to talk about?
[5541.70 → 5544.44] Microsoft removes offensive AI written articles.
[5544.54 → 5546.22] Do you want to talk about AI, Luke?
[5546.22 → 5548.66] I'm actually going to interject in front of the AI.
[5549.10 → 5549.48] Really?
[5549.64 → 5556.24] To talk about a topic that I think I've brought up for the last four WAN shows?
[5557.00 → 5557.40] Three?
[5557.68 → 5557.94] Okay.
[5558.00 → 5558.46] So, what?
[5558.50 → 5559.54] This is like a new streak?
[5559.76 → 5561.62] This is like your sub-streak?
[5561.80 → 5562.04] Yeah.
[5562.14 → 5562.36] Okay.
[5562.40 → 5562.94] What is it?
[5563.30 → 5569.54] Not much because of recent events, but I got some time to play Ballers gate 3 finally.
[5569.54 → 5570.42] Oh, okay.
[5570.80 → 5571.10] And?
[5571.24 → 5571.70] Fantastic.
[5571.94 → 5572.42] Bear sex?
[5572.84 → 5573.28] No.
[5573.84 → 5574.16] Okay.
[5574.16 → 5575.98] Not in my run, no.
[5576.22 → 5577.68] I mean, I heard that's a thing.
[5578.18 → 5579.52] I think it is, yeah.
[5580.26 → 5580.84] So, why not?
[5581.04 → 5581.56] I don't know if I'm-
[5581.56 → 5582.40] Do you not like bears?
[5582.44 → 5583.98] I don't know if I'm far enough in the game yet.
[5583.98 → 5584.68] What's your problem?
[5586.12 → 5587.06] Don't kink shame.
[5587.18 → 5587.58] I know.
[5587.84 → 5588.36] I know.
[5588.78 → 5592.84] I really didn't think we were going to go down this path.
[5594.76 → 5596.58] And Dan has excused himself.
[5596.66 → 5597.06] See you, Dan.
[5597.12 → 5597.88] Just leaves.
[5598.26 → 5599.16] Oh, wow.
[5599.16 → 5599.76] No.
[5600.64 → 5603.38] No, I think I know what character that would be.
[5603.84 → 5604.32] But I'm still-
[5604.32 → 5605.04] Probably the bear.
[5605.18 → 5606.38] I'm still-
[5606.38 → 5607.18] I'm just-
[5607.18 → 5608.36] It would be a druid.
[5608.42 → 5609.26] Yeah, I'm trying to help you.
[5609.28 → 5611.36] Because they could shapeshift into a bear.
[5611.40 → 5611.68] Yeah, yeah.
[5611.88 → 5612.28] Yeah, yeah.
[5612.36 → 5612.82] So, the bear.
[5613.52 → 5614.46] I think I-
[5614.46 → 5614.90] The bear.
[5614.90 → 5615.78] I think I know-
[5615.78 → 5620.16] They're not in my team yet, but I think I know who it would be.
[5621.50 → 5623.26] But no, but it's just a great game.
[5623.80 → 5627.12] I've really enjoyed Marian Studio games up to this point.
[5627.12 → 5632.88] They didn't get rid of the Marian Studio ID that is perfect.
[5633.46 → 5640.58] Like a lot of the combat mechanics and camera style and how the game kind of feels at its core still feels Marian, which is great.
[5640.58 → 5647.72] But then you have this D&D layer on top of it where there's like dice rolls for things, and you have inspiration so you can re-roll things and stuff.
[5647.86 → 5649.50] It's just really cool.
[5649.64 → 5654.30] If you can dress up as like a horny bear, would you say that it's a leisure suit Marian game?
[5656.06 → 5658.36] He's not here to press the bell, so I don't have to worry about it.
[5658.42 → 5659.82] I can mute your mic, by the way.
[5660.24 → 5660.42] What?
[5660.72 → 5661.88] That's another thing that I did.
[5662.06 → 5662.78] Shut up.
[5662.94 → 5663.72] And you're muted.
[5664.00 → 5664.58] You're gone.
[5665.42 → 5666.44] I still have-
[5666.44 → 5666.58] Oh.
[5666.58 → 5670.88] Um, okay, well, I guess you get to fix that now.
[5671.66 → 5672.50] Here's my mic's too.
[5672.52 → 5673.24] That'll be fine.
[5673.38 → 5673.58] Here.
[5673.82 → 5674.52] There, you're back.
[5674.82 → 5675.32] You're back.
[5676.08 → 5681.92] I put in special safety measures and told no one for the show today.
[5684.62 → 5686.68] The chat's calling them scum saves.
[5687.68 → 5688.52] Scum saves?
[5689.02 → 5689.32] What?
[5690.06 → 5691.70] You're scum saving the show.
[5692.08 → 5693.28] Because of the buttons?
[5693.48 → 5693.74] Yeah.
[5693.74 → 5697.24] It's great, dude.
[5697.30 → 5697.80] It's great.
[5698.14 → 5700.56] I got the idea from you unplugging my mic.
[5701.80 → 5703.34] I was like, how can I do that?
[5703.38 → 5703.96] But easier.
[5704.18 → 5704.54] Oh, no.
[5704.62 → 5705.60] Did you tell them about the buttons?
[5705.98 → 5706.78] Yeah, I used it.
[5706.98 → 5707.66] Oh, my God.
[5707.76 → 5707.96] Yeah.
[5708.64 → 5710.06] I want my screen sharing back.
[5710.48 → 5711.18] Next week.
[5711.30 → 5712.16] Not this week.
[5712.58 → 5713.26] Next week.
[5713.88 → 5714.42] All right.
[5714.52 → 5714.72] Fine.
[5714.88 → 5715.84] You have to be a good boy.
[5716.00 → 5717.62] I am a good boy.
[5717.62 → 5719.04] You have to earn your screen share.
[5719.08 → 5720.22] I'm an perfect boy.
[5720.22 → 5724.02] It feels good to do WAN show.
[5724.38 → 5725.08] But yeah, I don't know.
[5725.28 → 5726.78] I was very happy I got to play.
[5726.84 → 5727.74] I didn't get to play it much.
[5727.88 → 5729.10] But I played a little bit.
[5729.24 → 5733.96] And you just know within playing the game for like an hour, you're like, this is awesome.
[5734.36 → 5734.72] That's cool.
[5734.74 → 5736.00] And this is going to be awesome.
[5736.16 → 5738.78] And every bit that I played beyond that, I played with Wendell for a while.
[5738.98 → 5739.26] Cool.
[5739.44 → 5739.98] Is it multiplayer?
[5740.36 → 5740.62] Yeah.
[5740.86 → 5741.28] Oh, sick.
[5741.38 → 5742.78] Up to, I think, four people.
[5742.88 → 5743.02] Yeah.
[5743.02 → 5743.82] Thanks for inviting me.
[5743.82 → 5744.58] Yeah, no problem.
[5744.74 → 5746.52] You have to be careful with that right now.
[5746.62 → 5748.66] Because if somebody joins your campaign, they will.
[5748.66 → 5750.02] You can't remove the character.
[5750.22 → 5751.30] I came unstuck.
[5751.50 → 5754.82] Somebody on Reddit posted a perfect post about how to fix that.
[5755.18 → 5757.10] So you can actually delete it at the moment.
[5757.28 → 5757.56] Oh, wow.
[5757.56 → 5758.74] So you can undo that.
[5758.80 → 5759.22] I don't really care about that.
[5759.22 → 5760.24] Because I ruined my whole campaign.
[5760.96 → 5761.96] But yeah, we should play sometime.
[5762.28 → 5762.48] Yeah.
[5762.84 → 5763.06] Yeah.
[5763.42 → 5766.28] I suspect this is going to go similarly to Divinity Original Sin.
[5766.54 → 5766.68] Yeah.
[5766.68 → 5772.04] I have about 47,000 games that I play for, you know, a few hours with a single person and
[5772.04 → 5773.10] then never continue again.
[5773.10 → 5773.50] Yeah.
[5773.80 → 5774.36] That's fine.
[5774.40 → 5775.32] But it's fun anyway.
[5775.58 → 5776.60] I'm not going to do it.
[5776.78 → 5777.96] I'm busy playing Chained Echoes.
[5777.96 → 5781.46] Every single time I see you online playing Chained Echoes.
[5781.46 → 5782.72] So you know what the problem is?
[5783.46 → 5786.54] I have, I think, 70 hours in the game.
[5787.10 → 5790.58] But I have only made it to, like, the beginning of the third chapter.
[5790.94 → 5793.40] Because I just keep falling asleep.
[5797.12 → 5799.16] Not because it's a bad or boring game.
[5799.46 → 5802.02] But it has been a very exhausting week.
[5802.02 → 5804.72] Do you want to guess how many hours I have enslaved this buyer?
[5805.58 → 5806.14] Oh, no.
[5806.18 → 5807.00] I think I know this.
[5807.06 → 5809.64] I think it's like 5,000 hours or something stupid like that.
[5809.70 → 5810.52] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5810.62 → 5811.88] Because I just leave it open.
[5812.28 → 5815.30] There's, when you finish a run, it'll tell you, like, how long it took you.
[5815.52 → 5818.24] And sometimes I'll finish a run, it'll be like three days.
[5818.24 → 5823.36] People speed run it in, like, minutes.
[5824.30 → 5825.64] The anti-speed run.
[5825.94 → 5826.16] Yeah.
[5827.74 → 5829.96] I get so bothered by it, too, though.
[5830.00 → 5833.20] Because it's like, I don't know why I care.
[5833.20 → 5841.56] But, okay, remember when people were kind of scumming TF2 upgrades or something?
[5841.66 → 5841.84] Yeah.
[5841.84 → 5842.52] Or, like, getting items?
[5842.72 → 5843.74] There were specific...
[5843.74 → 5844.18] Those custom maps?
[5844.26 → 5845.20] Yeah, those custom maps.
[5845.44 → 5848.76] And remember Valve's Revenge?
[5849.18 → 5851.86] Where they made it, like, mess up your stats forever?
[5852.88 → 5855.86] So I have certain classes where...
[5855.86 → 5856.54] Oh, you did that?
[5856.82 → 5858.30] Yeah, where I did that.
[5858.42 → 5860.82] And so my stats are just completely broken.
[5861.06 → 5862.08] And there's no way to undo it.
[5862.08 → 5865.58] And because of the kind of person I am, that bothers me...
[5865.58 → 5867.10] That just ruins the whole game.
[5867.18 → 5868.42] So much.
[5868.52 → 5869.98] Like, I don't even really...
[5869.98 → 5875.60] A part of me is uneasy that other people play Beat Safer on our machine.
[5875.60 → 5880.56] Because there's lifetime stats for, like, successful cuts and percentages and stuff like that.
[5880.58 → 5881.60] And I'm like, these aren't real numbers.
[5882.00 → 5882.52] This sucks.
[5882.74 → 5884.90] And it's the same for, like, the Chained Echoes playtime.
[5885.06 → 5889.60] Like, the second I fell asleep once while the game was running, I was just like...
[5890.22 → 5891.66] I don't even know if I want to play this game anymore.
[5892.08 → 5892.56] Yeah.
[5892.98 → 5893.18] Yeah.
[5893.18 → 5893.50] I just...
[5893.50 → 5895.54] I hate it when there's a counter.
[5895.94 → 5897.30] And it's not accurate.
[5897.46 → 5898.04] It bothers me.
[5898.14 → 5899.98] So Slay of the Spire has something called Ascensions.
[5900.50 → 5904.12] And it's like a scaling hard mode, basically.
[5904.72 → 5905.34] There's...
[5905.34 → 5908.52] Every Ascension, there's a new type of difficulty that they introduce.
[5908.86 → 5910.44] Like, okay, bosses are harder now.
[5910.54 → 5911.80] Normal enemies are harder now.
[5912.02 → 5913.90] You heal for less after you beat a boss.
[5913.96 → 5914.42] That's pretty cool.
[5914.56 → 5915.46] Other random...
[5915.46 → 5916.60] So it's kind of like New Game Plus.
[5916.62 → 5918.18] Chances are less likely to go in your favour.
[5918.32 → 5918.90] Lots of different stuff.
[5918.90 → 5921.12] So the game gets harder up to 20 times.
[5921.12 → 5922.76] And it gets, like, really, really brutal.
[5923.00 → 5926.92] And I have Ascension 20 on The Silent, which is one of the characters.
[5927.20 → 5928.96] And I have, like, 18 on Ironclad.
[5929.06 → 5930.84] And then not that high on the other ones.
[5930.84 → 5940.78] If somebody played on my account and pushed one of the Ascensions, and it wasn't me, that would bother me a lot.
[5940.90 → 5941.18] Forever.
[5941.46 → 5941.72] Yeah.
[5941.82 → 5942.18] Probably.
[5942.40 → 5942.66] Yeah.
[5943.02 → 5943.28] Yeah.
[5943.76 → 5944.36] I hear that.
[5944.70 → 5945.54] That would, like...
[5945.54 → 5946.18] I don't...
[5946.18 → 5948.84] I've actually, like, had the thought before.
[5948.94 → 5952.04] Like, would I have to try to, like, wipe my save and just restart?
[5952.04 → 5956.58] I have some serious conversations with my kids about, you know, all kinds of things.
[5957.22 → 5963.22] And as a gamer dad, one of the serious conversations I had is, okay, you can play Cross Code.
[5965.18 → 5970.08] If you save over my save game, you are for real in trouble.
[5971.32 → 5972.44] Do not do that.
[5972.94 → 5975.84] Do you do, like, family sharing?
[5976.20 → 5976.80] Or do you just...
[5976.80 → 5978.12] Does everyone just use the same Steam account?
[5978.12 → 5984.30] No, um, it's probably time for me to just get around to setting everybody up with their own Steam accounts.
[5984.38 → 5989.74] There's so many, like, free-to-play games that, like, there are tons of stuff that they can do without using my Steam account.
[5990.00 → 5990.20] Yeah.
[5990.44 → 5995.82] But, like, if I buy a new game, I will typically just buy it on my account so that it's convenient for me.
[5995.98 → 5999.98] And so, like, our TV in the basement is just logged into my account.
[5999.98 → 6000.84] Yeah, I mean, that makes sense.
[6000.84 → 6002.98] So I'm, like, a good Rocket League player now, which is pretty cool.
[6003.92 → 6005.76] Well, my son plays Rocket League.
[6006.68 → 6007.08] Okay.
[6007.08 → 6007.20] Really?
[6007.52 → 6008.82] Yeah, and he just plays on my account.
[6008.92 → 6011.26] So I'm, like, I don't know what his rank is, but it's, like...
[6011.26 → 6015.80] Oh, so you mean, like, on a Steam observation level, you're a good Rocket League player.
[6015.90 → 6016.96] Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[6017.06 → 6019.32] I thought you actually, like, were playing with him a bunch.
[6019.40 → 6019.52] No.
[6019.52 → 6019.96] I was like, whoa.
[6020.00 → 6020.94] No, I suck at Rocket League.
[6021.00 → 6021.38] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6021.38 → 6023.34] Yeah, but I'm decent now, apparently.
[6023.90 → 6024.58] It's pretty cool.
[6026.14 → 6026.70] That's cool.
[6029.48 → 6032.98] Anyway, I wanted to take a short aside to just, like, talk about video games, I guess.
[6033.18 → 6034.12] People are saying what rank.
[6034.20 → 6035.08] I don't know if you should...
[6035.08 → 6037.26] I don't actually know.
[6037.40 → 6037.70] Okay.
[6037.96 → 6042.00] I mean, with all the like, millions of people at every stupid rank in Rocket League, I'm not worried about it.
[6042.00 → 6043.90] There's also, yeah, there's an insane amount of...
[6043.90 → 6044.80] No, I didn't mean that.
[6044.86 → 6047.14] I just mean, like, people are gonna...
[6047.14 → 6047.52] I don't know.
[6047.98 → 6049.40] I don't know how good it is.
[6049.40 → 6052.18] Yeah, I don't even know what their ranks in...
[6052.18 → 6055.44] But there's a ton of granularity in Rocket League ranks, and they change them, like, all the time.
[6055.74 → 6056.02] So...
[6056.02 → 6056.54] Oh, yeah.
[6056.62 → 6058.36] Or at least they've changed them a lot in the past.
[6058.40 → 6059.64] I don't know if they have changed them much.
[6059.76 → 6060.56] I'm sure he'd know.
[6062.02 → 6062.34] Yeah.
[6063.36 → 6065.36] Hey, Linus, what happened to that game showdown with Ludwig?
[6065.56 → 6066.92] So, here's something awkward.
[6067.48 → 6067.66] Mm.
[6067.66 → 6074.46] Is there a reason that you didn't tell me that the challenge I was describing was basically a format he already does?
[6074.62 → 6075.48] No, I did tell you that.
[6075.64 → 6076.22] Oh, did you?
[6076.60 → 6076.92] 100%.
[6076.92 → 6077.54] Oh, okay.
[6077.62 → 6077.80] Yeah.
[6078.40 → 6079.70] I don't know why I didn't realize that.
[6079.78 → 6080.28] Oh, yeah, no.
[6080.28 → 6084.62] We were doing, like, a float plane meeting in your office, and you mentioned that this had happened.
[6084.90 → 6086.72] And I was like, oh, yeah, he, like, does this.
[6086.92 → 6088.38] And I told you about it there.
[6088.56 → 6090.64] And then you were like, oh, we should talk about it on Sancho.
[6090.70 → 6095.12] And I guarantee you, you completely forgot between then and when Sancho happened.
[6095.66 → 6095.98] Oh.
[6095.98 → 6097.80] But I totally told you about this.
[6097.90 → 6098.02] Yeah.
[6098.14 → 6098.76] Yeah, that makes sense.
[6098.84 → 6099.30] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6099.30 → 6099.54] Definitely.
[6099.68 → 6099.92] Cool.
[6100.20 → 6101.48] So, anyway, I don't know.
[6101.70 → 6104.94] I, yeah, I guess I better ping him.
[6105.00 → 6107.18] If we're going to feud, we should probably, like, do it properly.
[6108.94 → 6109.42] You know?
[6110.12 → 6110.44] Yeah.
[6110.86 → 6111.16] Sure.
[6111.36 → 6111.56] Yeah.
[6111.64 → 6111.98] All right.
[6112.16 → 6112.40] Yeah.
[6112.52 → 6113.56] Maybe he's just training.
[6113.70 → 6115.24] Yeah, there's, like, a format and everything.
[6115.24 → 6118.88] You submit some games, there's some, like, neutral games or something.
[6119.04 → 6119.16] Yeah.
[6119.16 → 6119.86] And then he submits other games.
[6119.86 → 6125.58] I think it's hilarious that, like, yeah, I basically pitched his own format to him.
[6125.58 → 6127.52] It's awkward.
[6128.66 → 6129.42] So, good job.
[6129.54 → 6130.40] Good job, Linus.
[6130.52 → 6131.36] Yeah, I guess.
[6131.50 → 6132.92] Thanks for having my back there, Luke.
[6133.44 → 6134.72] I did!
[6134.72 → 6135.04] Shit!
[6138.18 → 6138.88] Oh, hey.
[6139.24 → 6141.60] We have a new segment for WAN Show.
[6142.52 → 6144.72] The segment is called This Was Not a Video.
[6144.72 → 6152.04] So, as part of our, I mean, this is something that we had already started before the week
[6152.04 → 6154.38] of introspection, as I've come to call it.
[6155.48 → 6159.94] But we have a new process for doing what's called exploratory testing.
[6160.68 → 6166.60] And so, instead of, we ran into this a handful of times when the labs would, labs team would
[6166.60 → 6173.30] get an assignment or get a project pitch from the writers, and they would basically run through
[6173.30 → 6174.32] and do all the testing.
[6174.32 → 6179.86] And then we find out, you know, there really wasn't much of a story there, unfortunately,
[6180.20 → 6183.62] and we can't really move forward with it, but we've done, like, all this testing now.
[6183.82 → 6191.72] And so, we made a new sort of process for pitching exploratory testing and setting a much more limited
[6191.72 → 6198.52] scope to help us answer whether there is something worth exploring.
[6200.82 → 6201.30] Dan.
[6201.54 → 6202.26] Thanks, Dan.
[6202.26 → 6208.08] Literally wasted paper creating a little thing to put on his little sign that says,
[6208.22 → 6208.86] this was not a video.
[6208.94 → 6210.38] Dan, it's not going to happen every week.
[6210.56 → 6212.74] It's not part of the regular program.
[6213.28 → 6213.46] Okay.
[6213.56 → 6221.12] The point is that we had a concept for a video that, in my brain, seemed kind of cool.
[6221.76 → 6228.66] And the idea was, should you disable the GPU on your CPU in order to free up some power budget
[6228.66 → 6230.88] to get better CPU performance?
[6230.88 → 6236.64] Because we know that modern chips can be so power and thermal constrained that any little bit,
[6236.70 → 6240.80] a few extra watts of idling GPU could potentially be problematic.
[6240.80 → 6249.16] And so, what we decided to do was, instead of testing, I think the scope that I saw when I kind of went,
[6249.24 → 6256.40] holy crap, are we really going to do all this testing without any idea if this is a completely dead end or not,
[6256.80 → 6263.42] was I think we wanted, like, six different CPUs, three AMD, three Intel, and then, like, a whole whack ton of different benchmarks.
[6263.42 → 6265.54] It's going to be, like, a week of testing or something like that.
[6265.60 → 6267.48] And I was looking at it going, oh, okay, hold on a second.
[6268.30 → 6274.50] Can we just take our most likely candidates, you know, the ones that we think are most power constrained,
[6274.50 → 6282.38] and then we test those, and we see if there's any performance to be gleaned.
[6282.72 → 6285.46] And then, if there's something there, well, then we keep digging.
[6285.58 → 6289.92] We go to the medium power and the lower power ones to see if, oh, actually, on those,
[6289.96 → 6292.30] you can just leave it on because they aren't power constrained anyway.
[6293.02 → 6301.76] So the notes say we recently canned a video on whether, yeah, this was inspired by the early behaviour from Ry zen 7000's GPU
[6301.76 → 6306.04] where having a display connected caused the CPU to not sleep properly, so it idled with high power consumption.
[6306.14 → 6307.26] That is fixed now.
[6308.12 → 6314.16] So our questions were what performance impact does the GPU have on the CPU when it's enabled versus disabled?
[6314.44 → 6318.42] Does the extra power draw and heat generated reduce max turbo speeds or durations?
[6318.66 → 6321.60] Does this change when a display is connected or disconnected?
[6321.60 → 6326.88] Does this change when you're using the GPU's hardware encoder, for example, in a streaming setup?
[6327.40 → 6338.78] And does a disabled 13400 behave identically to a 13400F, which just doesn't have the GPU from Intel?
[6338.78 → 6345.70] So whether they laser it off or whether it's done in firmware or whatever else, however they do that,
[6345.92 → 6350.14] is there some difference between disabling it yourself and having Intel disable it?
[6351.60 → 6357.64] So in summary, our exploratory testing showed there was no result.
[6358.36 → 6360.14] The question has no satisfying answer.
[6360.28 → 6364.54] There's not going to be, as far as we can tell, a significant measurable difference.
[6364.54 → 6376.98] And we kind of went, well, it's really hard to make a whole video where from start to finish, it's like, this doesn't matter.
[6377.22 → 6379.20] Here's all the new ways this doesn't matter.
[6379.46 → 6381.36] Here's a new scenario where this doesn't matter.
[6381.36 → 6382.66] We know the answer ahead of time, too.
[6382.78 → 6384.36] So this isn't like a voyage of discovery.
[6384.36 → 6385.24] Yeah.
[6385.50 → 6385.70] Yeah.
[6386.34 → 6391.18] We don't know for sure 100% that there are no CPUs out there.
[6392.32 → 6393.08] Just not that one.
[6393.14 → 6393.26] Yeah.
[6393.36 → 6397.66] We know that it's modern ones are looking like probably not really a thing.
[6398.50 → 6400.36] And we just...
[6401.46 → 6402.36] But...
[6402.36 → 6403.30] So there's no video.
[6403.30 → 6406.68] But I wanted a way to kind of talk about this stuff.
[6406.78 → 6417.62] Like, if we're going to test them, why don't we at least tell you guys, like, hey, we looked into this, and it seems like it might be a dead end.
[6417.74 → 6421.12] So that's our new segment called This Was Not a Video.
[6421.62 → 6423.78] And it was Should You Use Your GPU?
[6423.78 → 6425.34] The answer, as far as we can tell, is yes.
[6425.42 → 6426.82] Go ahead and turn on your GPU.
[6427.56 → 6429.20] Which is good, I suppose.
[6430.46 → 6432.76] Music labels are suing the Internet Archive.
[6433.30 → 6444.40] A group of six music labels, including Sony and BMG, are suing the Internet Archive over their Great 78, an attempt to preserve music that was recorded on 78 RPM discs, a format that was...
[6444.40 → 6445.68] Didn't we talk about this two weeks ago?
[6449.16 → 6450.10] I'm not sure.
[6450.88 → 6451.78] I don't think so.
[6452.26 → 6453.28] Yeah, I'm removing it.
[6453.28 → 6456.04] Let's talk about Microsoft removing offensive AI written articles.
[6456.22 → 6461.00] They have taken down a series of bizarre articles published by Microsoft Travel.
[6461.08 → 6461.44] Oh, this.
[6461.74 → 6462.36] Oh, it's this.
[6462.46 → 6462.66] Yes.
[6462.74 → 6463.06] Okay.
[6463.30 → 6464.78] I want to talk about this.
[6465.22 → 6472.40] Including an article that listed the Ottawa Food Bank as a tourist attraction with the caption...
[6474.40 → 6476.82] Life is already difficult enough.
[6477.80 → 6480.32] Consider going into it on an empty stomach.
[6481.52 → 6486.94] What the heck does that even mean?
[6486.94 → 6493.10] Another article on where to dine in Montreal suggested trying a hamburger.
[6493.10 → 6499.04] It gave a Wikipedia-style explanation of what a hamburger is.
[6499.04 → 6502.04] Then it suggested checking out McDonald's.
[6502.04 → 6503.04] I just read the next one.
[6503.04 → 6507.14] I just read the next one.
[6507.14 → 6516.14] Yet another article on local delicacies in Anchorage suggests trying seafood, which is...
[6516.14 → 6523.56] Basically any form of sea life regarded as food by humans.
[6523.56 → 6527.66] Probably including fish and shellfish.
[6527.66 → 6538.96] I wish this wasn't an AI writer, and it was just some writer that was like, these articles are boring.
[6538.96 → 6541.78] I'm just going to make them really weird.
[6546.28 → 6548.34] Because that's actually amazing.
[6548.34 → 6558.82] It's not quite a have you considered genocide moment, but it's pretty good.
[6560.94 → 6561.56] Oh, AI!
[6562.30 → 6563.26] Oh, okay.
[6563.26 → 6564.14] Oh, man.
[6564.14 → 6565.44] Oh, I needed that.
[6566.44 → 6569.64] Microsoft claims that the publication was the result of human error.
[6569.64 → 6570.26] Oh, yeah.
[6570.26 → 6572.86] Human error to put an AI in charge.
[6572.86 → 6574.30] That's the human error that occurred.
[6574.30 → 6575.36] Sorry, Microsoft.
[6575.36 → 6576.36] I'm not buying it.
[6576.36 → 6576.56] Sorry.
[6576.56 → 6576.74] What?
[6576.74 → 6577.24] What?
[6577.24 → 6577.26] What?
[6577.26 → 6582.66] They also say, in quotes, the content was generated through a combination of algorithmic techniques
[6582.66 → 6587.18] with human review, not a large language model or AI system.
[6587.18 → 6587.90] Yeah, sure.
[6587.90 → 6588.50] Sure.
[6588.50 → 6592.96] Microsoft laid off a significant portion of the MSN journalistic and editorial teams
[6592.96 → 6597.02] in favour of algorithmic content curation in mid-2020.
[6597.92 → 6605.20] In other AI writing news, a US judge recently determined that fully machine-authored artistic
[6605.20 → 6607.98] works are ineligible for copyright protection.
[6608.38 → 6611.00] This decision may yet be overturned on an appeal.
[6611.60 → 6611.92] Okay.
[6612.04 → 6617.24] A lot of people are complaining that they couldn't understand me when I read the Anchorage one.
[6617.24 → 6617.64] Okay.
[6617.84 → 6619.96] Do you want to try to read it and be intelligible?
[6622.96 → 6630.50] Yet another article on local delicacies in Anchorage suggests trying seafood, which is, in quotes,
[6630.50 → 6637.28] basically any form of sea life regarded as food by humans.
[6639.92 → 6643.60] Prominently including fish and shellfish.
[6643.60 → 6648.26] I'm sorry.
[6652.26 → 6652.82] Oh, no.
[6652.82 → 6653.38] It's art.
[6654.82 → 6655.98] It kind of is.
[6656.24 → 6659.58] That's what I like so much about each one of these is that they, like...
[6659.58 → 6660.56] It's just art.
[6660.66 → 6661.82] It just becomes art.
[6661.94 → 6662.56] It feels...
[6662.56 → 6664.08] It's not technically untrue.
[6664.20 → 6666.56] It feels almost like malicious compliance writing.
[6666.68 → 6666.88] Yeah.
[6667.00 → 6668.74] They're like, they got this task.
[6668.84 → 6671.48] They're like, all right, you need to write about local delicacies in Anchorage.
[6671.48 → 6673.40] You have to write 18 articles today.
[6673.54 → 6673.84] Yeah.
[6674.40 → 6676.10] And they're like, you know what?
[6676.10 → 6676.48] All right, fine.
[6676.82 → 6678.78] This is what seafood is.
[6679.04 → 6680.84] This is what hamburgers are.
[6681.22 → 6682.38] Good luck.
[6683.22 → 6684.66] Go to McDonald's.
[6685.50 → 6688.82] Food is something that you can eat to stay alive.
[6689.02 → 6690.56] No one in my generation has any money.
[6690.66 → 6691.50] Go to the food bank.
[6691.66 → 6694.38] Seafood is anything that is not land or air food.
[6694.38 → 6698.90] Oh, man.
[6698.98 → 6699.56] Oh, no.
[6700.08 → 6700.44] Okay.
[6701.40 → 6701.70] Whew.
[6703.50 → 6704.18] Anywho.
[6705.04 → 6706.68] What an amazing topic.
[6707.22 → 6712.72] Meta is blocking Canadian news, including satirical news.
[6712.94 → 6713.16] Yeah.
[6713.16 → 6714.38] So the recap.
[6714.74 → 6720.32] Meta has been blocking links to Canadian news on its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram,
[6720.78 → 6725.22] since August 1st in response to a law passed by the federal Canadian government requiring
[6725.22 → 6729.78] large tech companies to pay news sites when their content is linked on their platform.
[6730.38 → 6734.66] Google, meanwhile, says that it will do the same once the law takes full effect.
[6734.98 → 6739.22] The news block has been criticized for potentially endangering Canadians during ongoing crises,
[6739.44 → 6741.46] such as the ongoing forest fires.
[6741.46 → 6747.70] In addition to many legitimate news sources, Canada's own version of the Onion News, the
[6747.70 → 6750.46] Beaverton, was caught up in the ban.
[6750.76 → 6755.48] The site's editor sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg and clarified its page information to indicate
[6755.48 → 6756.44] that it is satirical.
[6756.90 → 6760.12] The ban on Beaverton material has since been lifted.
[6760.66 → 6762.38] I love their letter, by the way.
[6762.54 → 6767.28] Dear Mr. Zuckerberg, and I'm skipping a lot, this action is outrageous.
[6767.28 → 6773.28] To label us and our content as news is not only false, it is highly insulting and defamatory.
[6774.68 → 6776.28] To be clear, we are satirists?
[6778.28 → 6778.68] Satirists?
[6778.84 → 6784.06] Liars, miscreants, fabulists, hyperbolisms, beguilers, tricksters, and every other Tuesday,
[6784.50 → 6785.10] charlatans.
[6785.10 → 6793.86] If meta, God, what a stupid name, chose to block the content of pages that engaged in
[6793.86 → 6796.60] this activity, we would have no choice other than to accept it.
[6797.60 → 6804.62] But to be labelled as a common news organization alongside such deck as the Rebel and the National
[6804.62 → 6807.10] Post, it makes us feel dirty just to think about it.
[6807.14 → 6807.36] Anyway.
[6807.60 → 6808.10] Love their letter.
[6808.10 → 6808.78] Love their letter.
[6808.90 → 6811.00] It's exactly what I would expect from the Beaverton.
[6811.10 → 6811.34] Perfect.
[6811.48 → 6811.78] Thank you.
[6813.02 → 6813.34] Yeah.
[6814.98 → 6821.54] Matt from Labs Web posted in Flopping Chat saying, links to Scope are also apparently
[6821.54 → 6822.54] considered news.
[6822.76 → 6823.20] What?
[6824.50 → 6824.94] Seriously?
[6825.22 → 6828.32] They're just cleaving too much and then probably seeing who's going to complain and
[6828.32 → 6829.18] clean it up from there.
[6829.18 → 6830.08] That's my suspicion.
[6830.90 → 6832.40] God, what a stupid name.
[6833.74 → 6834.86] It really is.
[6834.86 → 6840.78] Now that the metaverse is well and truly dead and buried, it really...
[6840.78 → 6841.66] Swing and a miss on that one.
[6841.68 → 6841.90] Yeah.
[6841.94 → 6843.86] It aged like...
[6845.62 → 6847.28] I'm trying to think of something like...
[6847.28 → 6849.36] They should just rename to like AI.
[6849.72 → 6850.50] Is it a Mayfly?
[6850.84 → 6854.10] Mayfly that has like a 24-hour life cycle or something like that?
[6854.22 → 6854.60] Like what are they...
[6854.60 → 6855.26] Something like that.
[6856.88 → 6858.40] Mayfly life cycle.
[6860.34 → 6863.94] Like whatever the next thing they're working on is, they should just rename it that.
[6863.94 → 6867.04] They should have renamed themselves Threads for like four days.
[6868.24 → 6868.68] Yeah.
[6868.86 → 6872.20] Some Mayflies live for only eight to ten hours after they become an adult.
[6872.28 → 6872.84] So there you go.
[6873.06 → 6876.28] A little biology fact that it aged like a Mayfly.
[6878.36 → 6878.80] Yeah.
[6879.92 → 6881.52] Do we even have any other topics?
[6881.74 → 6882.62] Are we good?
[6882.72 → 6883.26] Did we do it?
[6884.24 → 6885.92] I think that's basically it.
[6886.00 → 6886.22] Yeah.
[6886.48 → 6888.04] Credit agency dinged for spam?
[6889.02 → 6889.30] Yeah.
[6889.88 → 6891.00] I mean, yeah.
[6891.28 → 6891.58] And?
[6891.70 → 6892.18] That happened.
[6892.82 → 6893.54] Which one?
[6894.54 → 6895.92] Credit agency dinged for spam.
[6896.02 → 6901.68] Credit reporting agency Experian has been fined $650,000 for violating spam laws.
[6902.22 → 6902.80] This fine?
[6902.96 → 6903.22] No.
[6903.36 → 6903.60] Okay.
[6903.66 → 6903.92] Whatever.
[6904.26 → 6908.50] This fine is 0.08% of their recent yearly net income.
[6909.22 → 6909.70] Cool.
[6910.36 → 6912.36] So basically what we're saying is spam is okay.
[6912.84 → 6913.06] Sorry.
[6913.12 → 6914.94] I know you were going to read the whole thing, but like...
[6914.94 → 6915.04] Sick.
[6915.04 → 6917.26] At the end of the day, none of it matters.
[6917.42 → 6919.68] What matters is that none of it mattered.
[6920.16 → 6920.30] Yep.
[6920.42 → 6920.70] Cool.
[6920.82 → 6921.46] That's unfortunate.
[6921.46 → 6923.34] Rockstar.
[6923.34 → 6924.34] This is kind of interesting.
[6924.84 → 6927.90] Rockstar acquires modding group that it once banned.
[6928.72 → 6934.48] Rockstar has acquired CFX.re, the modding team behind the biggest role-play servers for
[6934.48 → 6941.16] GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2, 5M and Red M. Despite the fact that they banned CFX.re,
[6941.30 → 6945.12] which I'm sure has a name that you're supposed to pronounce differently, principal creators
[6945.12 → 6948.80] from both games back in 2015.
[6948.80 → 6953.98] CF.re originally set up these dedicated servers for role-playing mods that allowed players to
[6953.98 → 6959.90] use custom vehicles, maps, and weapons and inhabit those game worlds as virtually anyone.
[6960.14 → 6964.14] As of April 2021, these servers had a quarter million players.
[6964.62 → 6965.00] Whoa.
[6965.00 → 6972.88] In 2015, Rockstar called the GTA server an unauthorized alternate multiplayer server that contains code
[6972.88 → 6974.98] to facilitate piracy.
[6975.44 → 6980.24] In November of last year, Rockstar changed its policy on role-play servers, allowing use of
[6980.24 → 6985.80] these servers so long as they are non-commercial, do not misuse IP or trademarks, and do not interfere
[6985.80 → 6988.12] with its official online and multiplayer services.
[6988.12 → 6992.00] I think it's cool.
[6992.26 → 6996.82] I don't necessarily think it's, I don't know the whole history around them banning them in
[6996.82 → 7002.12] the first place, but I think the fact that they hired on this team of dodders is cool.
[7002.40 → 7003.96] I like when that stuff happens, personally.
[7004.34 → 7009.00] When there was Skyrim dodders getting hired by Bethesda, I thought that was great.
[7009.40 → 7011.04] I think that type of stuff is fantastic.
[7011.04 → 7012.34] Here's a question for you.
[7012.34 → 7022.72] What if we see these projects kind of absorbed back into Rockstar's own portfolio in a way
[7022.72 → 7026.66] that is not as cool and not true to the original vision, then do you still support it?
[7029.60 → 7035.02] Are they just buying their way out of people liking this more popular piracy-friendly version
[7035.02 → 7035.82] of their game versus their own official?
[7035.82 → 7039.64] I mean, that's kind of unfortunate, but now these dodders have jobs, and if they accepted
[7039.64 → 7044.90] the job, they now have a career, and they got there through modding, which is like, that's
[7044.90 → 7046.70] the part of it that I think is cool, right?
[7046.96 → 7049.90] Like, yeah.
[7050.20 → 7050.70] I don't know.
[7051.22 → 7055.62] Like, we talked about that hacker earlier, and how there's a path for a lot of hackers.
[7055.70 → 7057.38] I'm not suggesting you do this.
[7057.60 → 7057.70] Yeah.
[7058.82 → 7065.92] But there has been a path that has been observed for hackers in the past, where you break into
[7065.92 → 7070.26] systems and then get hired by the owners of said system to try to fix the hole.
[7072.50 → 7074.82] And that's been an interesting thing.
[7075.60 → 7080.62] And then now there's this, where you're not breaking into the system, but you're showing
[7080.62 → 7083.30] that you're, you know, driven to work on this thing.
[7084.18 → 7085.76] And then you get hired for that.
[7085.90 → 7087.08] I think that's awesome.
[7087.08 → 7092.28] And if that means that you lose certain mods, that's unfortunate.
[7094.10 → 7097.62] But I'm happy that people are able to get careers doing the thing that they clearly
[7097.62 → 7098.12] love to do.
[7098.36 → 7099.10] I like that part.
[7100.68 → 7101.04] Yeah.
[7101.28 → 7101.78] All right.
[7101.82 → 7103.24] Is it time for WAN Show After Dark?
[7105.16 → 7106.38] I think so.
[7106.42 → 7108.96] Or you hack Valve and they honeypot you, and you get arrested, lol.
[7109.46 → 7111.36] It says Nameless Ted in the flow plane chat.
[7111.36 → 7114.96] There's like, I do not suggest doing it.
[7115.02 → 7117.26] And there are a lot of specific ways to like, kind of do it properly.
[7117.34 → 7117.80] Yeah, you can go.
[7118.06 → 7118.36] You're good.
[7118.56 → 7119.02] Whatever you want.
[7120.78 → 7121.14] Nice.
[7124.06 → 7125.46] It's WAN After Dark.
[7126.38 → 7126.72] Yeah.
[7126.86 → 7128.46] I think it's going to be a short WAN After Dark today.
[7128.46 → 7131.10] And it kind of literally is because it's past midnight already.
[7131.46 → 7132.18] Lol, got him.
[7140.18 → 7141.02] Hit me, Dan.
[7142.36 → 7142.88] Okay.
[7143.16 → 7143.62] Let's see.
[7143.70 → 7144.40] Yeah, we've got a few here.
[7145.26 → 7146.06] Hi, Sancho.
[7146.20 → 7148.88] Hope you guys and team are staying strong.
[7149.18 → 7154.14] Have you ever had any experiences where you thought to yourselves, if I do this or cross
[7154.14 → 7156.42] this line, there is no going back?
[7159.44 → 7162.20] I think when we bought the studio.
[7162.60 → 7163.62] I was going to say, yeah, I mean.
[7164.50 → 7165.60] That was huge.
[7165.72 → 7168.92] What an enormous, life-changing moment, right?
[7168.92 → 7171.92] Like, it was a...
[7171.92 → 7174.04] Man, how much of it was dead at the time?
[7175.76 → 7180.40] By the time we did all the tenant improvements and everything, like built out the space and
[7180.40 → 7184.18] stuff, like we were probably a million dollars in debt, which was...
[7184.18 → 7185.40] At that point in time was enormous.
[7185.84 → 7186.20] Yeah.
[7186.40 → 7189.82] Like, I hoped I would get out of it eventually.
[7190.02 → 7192.36] You know, like it was not trivial, right?
[7192.36 → 7193.36] Um...
[7193.36 → 7199.36] I mean, obviously, when we started the whole thing, um...
[7199.36 → 7206.46] Yeah, I mean, walking into my boss's office at NCI was pretty terrifying when I laid out
[7206.46 → 7210.94] that I am leaving, because that was the only way that I had any kind of negotiating position.
[7211.06 → 7213.08] I basically had to say, look, I'm leaving regardless.
[7213.08 → 7216.78] So, you have two paths you can follow.
[7216.90 → 7223.58] You can follow the path where I help keep NCI Tech Tips running and help you transition this.
[7224.08 → 7228.52] Or you have to figure out how to replace me in, like, you know, two weeks' notice or whatever.
[7229.34 → 7230.14] Um...
[7230.14 → 7230.58] Wait, sorry.
[7230.68 → 7231.32] What are they to help you?
[7231.34 → 7231.56] Right.
[7231.74 → 7236.58] Either I walk away, and you try to figure out how to transition this thing in, like, two weeks' notice
[7236.58 → 7240.12] and I go work for a competitor and I will build this again for them.
[7240.12 → 7240.68] Um...
[7240.68 → 7242.16] Or you work with me.
[7242.52 → 7243.64] I take Linus Tech Tips.
[7243.86 → 7245.92] I help you keep NCI Tech Tips running.
[7246.00 → 7247.12] I help you transition it.
[7247.48 → 7248.92] And I will give you...
[7248.92 → 7249.04] Uh...
[7249.04 → 7251.46] He asked for, like, four months' notice or something like that.
[7251.62 → 7253.66] Which, in retrospect, is way too long.
[7253.74 → 7259.30] You should never be working at a job that you know you're leaving for, like, a quarter.
[7260.12 → 7260.56] Um...
[7260.56 → 7262.46] By the end of it, like...
[7262.46 → 7265.30] I mean, the good news is there was a lot of time to transition things off me.
[7265.30 → 7268.58] The bad news is by the last month, I...
[7268.58 → 7270.10] No one was assigning me anything.
[7270.18 → 7271.16] I didn't have anything to do.
[7271.78 → 7272.18] Because...
[7272.18 → 7274.54] I think there are some scenarios where it might make sense.
[7274.68 → 7278.60] Extremely senior people in certain positions, like, you want to...
[7278.60 → 7281.06] If you want to leave super amicably...
[7281.06 → 7285.76] I've seen situations where, like, you want to give a really serious amount of time so they can recruit
[7285.76 → 7288.42] and, like, fully train up the replacement, stuff like that.
[7290.42 → 7290.90] Um...
[7290.90 → 7292.70] Four months is a long time.
[7292.70 → 7293.26] But...
[7293.26 → 7294.46] I've heard of...
[7294.46 → 7296.38] I've heard of some from very long...
[7296.38 → 7298.38] Long, uh...
[7298.38 → 7300.20] Notice periods.
[7300.44 → 7301.12] Man, it's late.
[7301.64 → 7302.02] Yeah.
[7305.30 → 7306.08] Next up.
[7308.04 → 7308.72] Uh...
[7308.72 → 7309.98] Let's see here.
[7310.94 → 7314.26] Hey, LLD, any favourite stories from LTX and Whale land?
[7314.26 → 7314.32] What?
[7318.16 → 7319.16] Hmm...
[7319.16 → 7322.42] Man, I just, uh...
[7322.42 → 7325.06] I just loved the energy of the crowd.
[7325.06 → 7325.24] Yeah.
[7325.24 → 7326.44] Like, even just the kickoff.
[7326.68 → 7328.42] Like, welcome to LTX on the first day.
[7328.64 → 7329.72] It was so positive the whole time.
[7329.80 → 7330.06] Yeah.
[7330.54 → 7331.56] Everyone was super cool.
[7331.72 → 7332.32] It was pretty cool.
[7332.58 → 7333.74] Creator Dinner was super cool.
[7333.96 → 7334.08] Yeah.
[7334.26 → 7335.46] Um...
[7335.46 → 7336.58] Just, like, gaming in the land.
[7336.64 → 7338.62] I never get to do that stuff these days.
[7338.62 → 7344.62] Just, like, desperately trying to get my poor team of...
[7345.22 → 7345.62] Just...
[7346.74 → 7347.54] You guys tried.
[7347.70 → 7349.60] I love my team, but you guys are terrible.
[7349.90 → 7350.46] Um...
[7350.46 → 7354.96] Yeah, trying to get my team to cap some flags in Blood Bulk.
[7355.24 → 7355.44] Yeah.
[7355.56 → 7356.30] Halo, uh...
[7356.30 → 7356.86] Halo CE.
[7357.40 → 7357.62] Yeah.
[7357.88 → 7359.30] I mean, the whole thing was...
[7359.30 → 7362.90] It's kind of a blur, looking back on it now, but it was...
[7362.90 → 7364.14] It was a blast of a blur.
[7364.22 → 7365.08] A blur of a blast.
[7365.20 → 7365.48] It was...
[7365.48 → 7366.16] It was really fun.
[7366.34 → 7367.88] I hope we're able to do it again.
[7368.62 → 7369.46] Yeah.
[7372.28 → 7372.68] Uh...
[7372.68 → 7377.68] Linus, I am buying this screwdriver specifically for working and fixing equipment for Crispy
[7377.68 → 7378.04] Creme.
[7378.72 → 7379.46] Do you...
[7379.46 → 7380.14] Oh...
[7380.14 → 7383.64] Did you ever think the screwdriver would be as widely used as it is?
[7384.44 → 7385.04] I hoped.
[7385.12 → 7386.26] I mean, we...
[7386.26 → 7387.42] We ordered a hundred thousand...
[7387.42 → 7387.90] There's a lot of hope.
[7387.98 → 7388.82] Right out of the gate.
[7388.92 → 7389.10] Yeah.
[7389.20 → 7390.32] The hopes, hopes and dreams.
[7390.60 → 7391.36] Um...
[7391.36 → 7392.74] I had a lot riding on that.
[7392.82 → 7393.28] That was...
[7393.28 → 7393.62] Oh, man.
[7393.62 → 7394.36] That was another...
[7394.36 → 7395.98] That was another, like, do-or-die moment.
[7395.98 → 7397.98] We were either going to be a physical goods business...
[7398.62 → 7404.18] Or we were going to, like, sink that portion of the business on this, like, stupid screwdriver
[7404.18 → 7405.46] and backpack hail...
[7405.46 → 7407.38] Like, double Hail Mary that we were throwing.
[7408.18 → 7408.96] Um...
[7408.96 → 7409.66] So I hoped.
[7410.36 → 7411.92] But I don't know if I...
[7411.92 → 7413.04] I don't know if I really believed it.
[7413.08 → 7416.24] I mean, you saw how stressed I was leading up to the launch of the screwdriver and backpack.
[7416.52 → 7417.84] Like, I was a mess, man.
[7417.96 → 7418.14] Yeah.
[7418.92 → 7420.68] These were, like, multi-million dollar bets.
[7420.80 → 7423.10] Those were both bigger bets than this warehouse.
[7423.10 → 7433.20] Which I think says a lot about, you know, our company's trajectory and also says a lot about stupid Vancouver real estate.
[7433.52 → 7440.66] The fact that a building could be worth less than an order of screwdrivers that long ago and now is just...
[7440.66 → 7441.62] Yeah.
[7442.32 → 7442.58] Yeah.
[7442.72 → 7445.86] To the point where it's, like, hard to even find space to expand into.
[7445.94 → 7446.42] It's ridiculous.
[7447.08 → 7447.56] Extremely.
[7447.56 → 7450.30] Yo, welcome back, folks.
[7450.72 → 7452.64] Love this capacitor design.
[7453.12 → 7454.42] Racket Sports question for you.
[7455.00 → 7456.98] Have you ever played racquetball or squash?
[7457.46 → 7461.30] Any thoughts on how the feel, strategy, or flow of badminton compares?
[7461.96 → 7463.56] Have you ever played racquetball or squash?
[7463.90 → 7466.28] Yeah, but it's been a really long time.
[7466.42 → 7468.36] I only played squash once.
[7468.44 → 7469.50] I actually played with Ed.
[7470.28 → 7471.76] I remember this for some reason.
[7471.76 → 7475.24] Yeah, we were in Richmond shooting a video, and it was like...
[7475.24 → 7476.08] Or we...
[7476.08 → 7477.20] There was a flight and we...
[7477.20 → 7478.64] We were early for it or something.
[7478.70 → 7479.06] I don't remember.
[7479.14 → 7479.92] We had time to kill.
[7480.04 → 7481.20] We were in Richmond, and we were like...
[7482.52 → 7484.02] Let's play squash for some reason?
[7484.24 → 7485.28] Well, he played.
[7485.40 → 7486.96] He played when he was in, like, high school or something.
[7487.02 → 7487.22] Okay.
[7487.36 → 7490.00] And I had said, like, I really want to try it.
[7490.06 → 7492.18] It just looked so fun.
[7492.60 → 7496.12] Like, just the like, the three-dimensionality of it.
[7496.16 → 7498.58] How you can kind of hit it backwards and stuff.
[7498.72 → 7499.26] Like, there's no...
[7499.26 → 7500.80] It's not a net.
[7501.12 → 7502.48] It's a line on the wall.
[7502.62 → 7502.90] I just...
[7502.90 → 7503.18] I don't know.
[7503.22 → 7505.26] It just kind of tickled me.
[7505.26 → 7508.30] It's so fun.
[7508.50 → 7508.94] It's...
[7508.94 → 7509.70] Yeah, it's really fun.
[7509.76 → 7510.76] I've never tried racquetball.
[7510.84 → 7514.98] My understanding is it's on the same court, but instead of the squishy ball, it's like
[7514.98 → 7516.24] a hard rubber ball.
[7517.12 → 7517.92] But I...
[7517.92 → 7518.50] I don't know.
[7518.62 → 7518.82] Yeah.
[7518.98 → 7519.40] Yeah.
[7519.40 → 7520.70] Really, really, really fun.
[7522.22 → 7527.78] I'm not good enough at it to comment on, you know, how it compares to badminton or whatever
[7527.78 → 7528.02] else.
[7528.08 → 7528.24] Yeah.
[7528.24 → 7529.24] Definitely had a blast.
[7529.42 → 7532.74] I played it, like, a few times when I was, like, genuinely a child.
[7532.98 → 7534.20] Like, very, very young.
[7534.46 → 7535.12] So I...
[7535.12 → 7536.24] I don't even remember how it works.
[7537.72 → 7538.16] Hi, DLL.
[7538.44 → 7541.24] Started playing Baldur's Gate with my wife in split-screen.
[7541.62 → 7545.36] Unfortunately, not too many games have split-screen couch co-op these days.
[7545.44 → 7545.68] Yeah.
[7545.96 → 7548.52] What are your favourites, either recent or old?
[7549.36 → 7549.74] Oh, dude.
[7549.80 → 7550.64] The Halo games.
[7551.48 → 7554.30] Got a lot of play on the split-screen.
[7554.30 → 7555.76] My dad and I...
[7555.76 → 7556.14] I was...
[7556.14 → 7556.70] I don't remember if...
[7556.70 → 7557.92] I think it was Halo 2.
[7558.22 → 7559.22] I don't remember which one it was.
[7559.50 → 7560.84] It was either Halo 1 or Halo 2.
[7561.68 → 7567.10] When you beat one of the missions, it would show the like, the shield icon for the difficulty
[7567.10 → 7567.46] level.
[7568.22 → 7572.64] So, like, legendary, it had the like, the shield and the two swords crossing and the skull
[7572.64 → 7573.06] on it.
[7573.14 → 7574.42] And then it had all the other ones.
[7574.56 → 7579.24] And we had this mission where we wanted every single icon for every single level.
[7579.24 → 7585.70] So, my dad and I beat every single level in that Halo game on Legendary and the other
[7585.70 → 7586.26] difficulties.
[7586.60 → 7587.96] And it was actually, like, kind of fun.
[7588.36 → 7596.54] Can I derail this conversation for a second here and talk about how the gaming culture
[7596.54 → 7600.50] has changed by having so many options for games?
[7601.50 → 7602.08] You would...
[7602.08 → 7607.02] Unless you are a completions, and you're, like, kind of into that, you would never play
[7607.02 → 7608.02] a game like that anymore.
[7608.02 → 7611.46] And I really realized this.
[7611.46 → 7611.94] You probably really changed that.
[7612.04 → 7614.68] I realized this as I was going through.
[7614.94 → 7620.24] And there was some stupid puzzle where you're, like, supposed to push orbs around in Chained
[7620.24 → 7622.12] Echoes that I just...
[7622.12 → 7622.98] My brain was tired.
[7623.06 → 7623.72] I didn't feel like it.
[7623.86 → 7627.90] And so, I went to look up a walkthrough for it.
[7628.26 → 7629.38] And then there was also...
[7629.38 → 7634.92] I was trying to get some information on, like, crystal combining and, like, you know,
[7634.96 → 7635.86] kind of the rules around that.
[7635.86 → 7639.30] And finding resources for this game...
[7639.30 → 7644.42] There's, like, a handful of Reddit threads on any given subject, but basically nothing.
[7644.52 → 7648.92] And this is a game that, from my understanding, was reasonably successful.
[7648.92 → 7652.36] But you compare that to trying to find...
[7652.36 → 7659.58] Like, the way that people will obsessively deconstruct a game like, you know, one of my all-time favourites
[7659.58 → 7662.62] and, like, my childhood favourite game, Final Fantasy VI.
[7662.78 → 7667.36] The way that people have dug into, you know, every little bug and miscalculation in the combat
[7667.36 → 7673.84] system and every possible combination of, you know, weapons and relics and esters and other items and whatever else, right?
[7675.36 → 7676.80] The way that people...
[7676.80 → 7680.80] And I'm sure there are exceptions to this, but the way that...
[7682.80 → 7684.80] The...
[7684.80 → 7693.10] The common experiences that we shared were more common, I feel like.
[7693.24 → 7697.80] If you were a gamer growing up in the late 90s, early 2000s,
[7697.80 → 7705.18] the grand scheme of things, were there that many perfect games for the Nintendo 64?
[7707.00 → 7707.48] Goldeneye?
[7707.68 → 7708.02] Sure.
[7708.54 → 7709.30] Donkey Kong?
[7709.66 → 7710.42] Donkey Kong.
[7711.44 → 7712.28] Mario Kart.
[7712.62 → 7713.70] Mario Kart was amazing.
[7713.78 → 7714.24] Mario Party.
[7715.30 → 7716.06] Smash Bros.
[7716.26 → 7717.06] Sure, Smash.
[7718.04 → 7721.32] And, like, we're going to probably be able to come up with 10 or 20.
[7721.32 → 7728.68] But nowadays, if I were to say, okay, yeah, like, how many good games are there for Steam Deck?
[7729.06 → 7729.78] Star Fox.
[7730.02 → 7730.32] Are any...
[7731.04 → 7731.68] Are any two...
[7731.68 → 7732.60] Super Mario 64.
[7733.74 → 7734.74] That's not the point.
[7735.00 → 7737.86] The point is that we're talking about on the order of tens.
[7738.18 → 7738.48] Yeah.
[7738.72 → 7746.00] Whereas now, we're talking about a game library, smorgasbord, on the order of thousands,
[7746.00 → 7752.84] games, to the point where you and I could both be gamers, play nothing but, like, S-tier
[7752.84 → 7757.04] awesome games, and have absolutely nothing to talk about to each other.
[7757.48 → 7758.56] Do you get what I mean?
[7758.84 → 7764.62] Yeah, part of that is the historical library of games, because, like, as much as I'm pumping
[7764.62 → 7769.24] up Baldur's Gate, and we had Elden Ring come out, which was just, like, incredible, and there's
[7769.24 → 7773.64] a lot of high hopes for Starfield, and the new God of War games have been fantastic, and
[7773.64 → 7776.70] there is actually good stuff going on right now.
[7777.38 → 7782.82] I feel like the frequency of good game releases has maybe decreased in recent years.
[7783.14 → 7784.64] There are still bangers coming out.
[7784.76 → 7786.22] You're talking AAA only right now.
[7787.26 → 7790.84] Yeah, there are some big-time indies, but I feel like the indies have slowed down a little
[7790.84 → 7794.16] bit, too, if I could possibly argue.
[7794.74 → 7798.42] In the like, Super Meat Boy era, it was all the time.
[7798.92 → 7800.54] Indies were, like, the best thing to play.
[7800.62 → 7802.58] But was that just Humble Bundle pumping it?
[7802.58 → 7803.72] I don't think so.
[7804.08 → 7804.44] Genuinely.
[7805.22 → 7807.60] Okay, so they don't just have less marketing now?
[7807.70 → 7811.70] Because, like, I don't know, Dave the Diver was a breakout hit.
[7811.80 → 7812.16] Fantastic.
[7812.60 → 7813.54] I'm not saying they don't exist.
[7813.54 → 7814.48] I'm not saying they don't exist.
[7814.48 → 7815.70] I'm not saying they don't exist.
[7815.84 → 7816.04] Sure.
[7816.14 → 7818.90] I feel like maybe it was Humble Bundle.
[7820.44 → 7821.28] I don't know.
[7821.80 → 7823.14] Yeah, people in chat are piping up.
[7823.26 → 7825.04] There was, like, a golden age of indies.
[7825.40 → 7827.26] Technically, Baldur's Gate 3 is an indie.
[7827.36 → 7828.04] They have no publisher.
[7828.14 → 7828.44] Okay.
[7830.22 → 7830.62] Okay.
[7830.62 → 7830.90] Okay.
[7830.90 → 7834.02] Um, actually.
[7835.30 → 7836.24] What you're referring to is.
[7836.24 → 7840.02] I mean, that's really cool and shows a lot of, a huge amount of success for Marian.
[7840.26 → 7844.78] There was a ton of stuff going around of people being, like, no one should be able to expect
[7844.78 → 7850.64] the quality level of Baldur's Gate 3 because they obviously had a huge amount of funding
[7850.64 → 7856.88] from, like, the D&D owners, which I think is, like, Wizards of the Coast or something.
[7857.12 → 7857.46] I don't remember.
[7857.52 → 7858.20] Hasbro, basically.
[7858.50 → 7858.90] Hasbro, yeah.
[7859.56 → 7863.44] And, like, the Marian studio people were like, what?
[7864.64 → 7865.70] That's not how this works.
[7865.98 → 7868.32] Like, they didn't pay us to make this.
[7868.74 → 7869.98] Like, what do you mean?
[7869.98 → 7871.92] Um, yeah.
[7872.02 → 7872.44] I don't know.
[7872.58 → 7877.70] I think it's very cool that they've been able to find that much success, um, basically
[7877.70 → 7878.12] on their own.
[7878.22 → 7878.82] I think that's awesome.
[7880.64 → 7882.24] Last one I've got for you curated here.
[7882.74 → 7884.48] Hey, DLL, I love that you're back.
[7884.54 → 7885.64] And the D-bread.
[7886.32 → 7891.42] When will the I don't know, uh, when will the stubby screwdriver come to the LTT store?
[7891.42 → 7894.80] I really, really want it in every colour I can get it.
[7894.88 → 7895.52] Maybe twice.
[7895.66 → 7898.70] It was supposed to launch, uh, this week?
[7898.76 → 7899.18] Last week?
[7899.32 → 7899.90] Something around there.
[7899.92 → 7900.26] I forget.
[7900.36 → 7900.92] Something like that.
[7901.44 → 7906.54] I don't know the exact date, but, um, we have stock.
[7906.88 → 7908.54] Like, we're, we're ready to press go.
[7908.66 → 7912.50] I think we are probably going to launch it next week would be my guess.
[7914.08 → 7914.50] Yes.
[7915.12 → 7916.36] Yes, that would be my guess.
[7916.60 → 7918.72] Okay, we do have a few more potentials to go through, Luke.
[7919.66 → 7920.06] Um.
[7921.74 → 7922.62] Oh, man.
[7924.30 → 7929.02] Chris P asks, uh, I love the multiple videos about mortifying Linus's home.
[7929.14 → 7930.76] I'm going through similar projects now.
[7930.86 → 7932.40] What are your favourite upgrades?
[7933.46 → 7936.08] I think you could probably list, uh, list as least favourite upgrades.
[7936.08 → 7938.62] Yeah, yeah, I think that would be a way easier list.
[7938.84 → 7943.86] Uh, I think the ones that provide joy to my family are the only ones that I care about
[7943.86 → 7946.16] because realistically, I don't really use any of it.
[7947.78 → 7950.82] My daughters really like their RGB reading lamps.
[7951.42 → 7951.90] That's cool.
[7952.08 → 7953.58] Yeah, and they're not really reading lamps.
[7953.68 → 7957.68] We did strips around the outside of their bunk bed, so it kind of shines off the wall
[7957.68 → 7962.36] so they can, so they can read and they, they help me pick, you know, what colour they want.
[7962.42 → 7964.44] And so they're, they're super into that.
[7964.44 → 7968.10] I think that's kind of it.
[7968.52 → 7969.56] Oh, you know what?
[7969.62 → 7970.32] No, no.
[7970.42 → 7973.60] I, I really like having easy, uh, garage door access on my phone.
[7974.44 → 7975.20] That's super handy.
[7975.84 → 7976.20] Yeah.
[7976.20 → 7977.30] I don't even carry a key to my house.
[7977.52 → 7978.16] Like, why would I?
[7980.22 → 7980.54] Yeah.
[7980.82 → 7982.14] Yeah, it's just a key to lose.
[7982.22 → 7986.92] Like, I, I, I, I, oh, I hate having a bulky key thing.
[7986.92 → 7987.52] What if your phone's dead?
[7987.58 → 7990.12] Well, I don't know.
[7990.18 → 7991.10] Be responsible, scrub.
[7991.58 → 7991.90] Wow.
[7992.44 → 7993.14] Yeah, charge your phone.
[7993.30 → 7993.94] What's wrong with you?
[7994.12 → 7995.14] What if you drop it in the pool?
[7995.30 → 7995.62] Oh.
[7995.62 → 7997.94] You knew that was coming.
[7998.44 → 7999.76] You, I couldn't resist.
[8000.06 → 8000.84] I'm so sorry.
[8000.96 → 8002.28] Stab, stab, but don't twist.
[8005.10 → 8006.74] Oh, I feel bad now.
[8007.18 → 8008.36] You don't feel bad.
[8009.54 → 8009.86] Oh.
[8010.54 → 8011.06] Look at you.
[8011.18 → 8011.62] Look at you.
[8011.96 → 8012.44] Remorseless.
[8016.44 → 8017.30] Oh, man.
[8017.64 → 8020.34] First time catching the show live as I'm currently in Japan,
[8020.98 → 8023.70] where everything is very different from Europe.
[8023.70 → 8025.48] In the many trips you had around the world,
[8025.58 → 8027.64] what was the biggest culture shock?
[8029.08 → 8029.48] Ooh.
[8034.88 → 8036.20] Biggest culture shock.
[8036.30 → 8038.18] I mean, everywhere is so unique.
[8038.26 → 8038.50] Yeah.
[8039.12 → 8041.22] And like, I don't know if I would describe it as a shock,
[8041.22 → 8048.22] but I, I, I, I was blown away by just how universally friendly people in Taiwan are.
[8048.52 → 8048.96] Oh, yeah.
[8049.28 → 8049.80] Like that.
[8049.94 → 8051.30] I know people say.
[8051.30 → 8051.78] For sure.
[8051.96 → 8052.50] People will.
[8052.50 → 8055.24] Everybody says, oh, yeah, you know, go here.
[8055.32 → 8056.24] The people are so nice.
[8056.84 → 8058.58] I hear people say that about Vancouver.
[8058.70 → 8059.76] Taiwan's on like a different level.
[8059.96 → 8060.54] And I'm just like, nah, dog.
[8060.88 → 8065.90] I, I, I actually like live in Vancouver and people in Vancouver are not friendly and like
[8065.90 → 8067.26] not that helpful and stuff.
[8067.58 → 8073.00] Like you'll find ones that are, but in general, I think we're, we're a pretty reclusive sort
[8073.00 → 8074.10] of keep to ourselves sort.
[8074.10 → 8079.42] I feel like I'm more like, you know, on the same team as the people around me in Taiwan
[8079.42 → 8079.98] than here.
[8079.98 → 8080.30] Yeah.
[8080.30 → 8084.16] Like in Taiwan though, like everyone is like actually super friendly.
[8084.44 → 8085.08] You're all in this together.
[8085.08 → 8088.42] And you talk to Taiwanese people, and they're like, yeah, everyone's like friendly to each
[8088.42 → 8088.80] other too.
[8088.84 → 8090.06] And I'm like, yeah, yeah, that's that.
[8090.16 → 8090.24] Yeah.
[8090.24 → 8091.14] That's like super cool.
[8091.20 → 8091.80] That's awesome.
[8091.94 → 8092.18] Yeah.
[8092.18 → 8093.50] My badminton coach is from there.
[8093.68 → 8098.66] So, um, I, whenever I'm like going back there, we just kind of like chat about it and stuff.
[8098.66 → 8102.72] Um, Australian here, the shipping is going to hurt.
[8102.84 → 8103.66] Hey, thanks Connor.
[8103.66 → 8107.96] Um, but want to help support you all much love ford brand and all their chaotic energy.
[8108.14 → 8111.66] Uh, is there any other sponsors that have been good or weird to work?
[8111.72 → 8113.34] I don't think anyone is weird.
[8113.34 → 8113.94] Liked brand.
[8114.06 → 8119.00] Nobody really gets the whole influencer.
[8119.00 → 8120.82] Because they don't just do influencer marketing.
[8120.82 → 8128.64] I think a lot of brands do influencer marketing, but brand, um, they build relationships with
[8128.64 → 8134.02] influencers that they see having long-term staying power in their content.
[8134.40 → 8136.50] So it's, it's kind of a funny thing.
[8136.50 → 8143.24] Like on the one hand, if you see a spot for, uh, for a brand on a channel, um, you might have
[8143.24 → 8147.12] like a positive association for that brand based on liking the channel.
[8147.54 → 8150.56] I would say brand works the other way as well.
[8150.56 → 8157.20] Where if you see a brand spot somewhere, it's probably because the folks at brand actually
[8157.20 → 8162.02] like think this is like good and, uh, they want their, they want their product associated
[8162.02 → 8162.42] with it.
[8162.42 → 8165.38] It's not just, um, it's not just like scattershot.
[8165.66 → 8166.88] So mad respect to them.
[8166.92 → 8169.80] They've, they've put a lot of thought, and they've put a lot of work into their strategy.
[8169.80 → 8172.78] It's not, it's not just chaotic.
[8173.14 → 8180.42] Um, I think they, uh, they, they play the character really well, but, uh, make no mistake
[8180.42 → 8181.96] they're super, super smart.
[8183.88 → 8189.64] If you had to choose between all forms of wireless internet or all forms of rechargeable batteries,
[8189.64 → 8192.76] which one would you choose and why?
[8192.88 → 8195.68] So I have to pick between wireless internet and rechargeable batteries.
[8195.68 → 8198.30] What is the point of wireless internet?
[8198.30 → 8200.40] If I don't have rechargeable batteries?
[8201.92 → 8204.64] Oh man, I'm going to take rechargeable batteries.
[8206.24 → 8206.72] Luke.
[8206.84 → 8207.16] Really?
[8208.74 → 8210.90] So you'd have no internet on your phone.
[8210.94 → 8214.74] Yeah, but then I could at least play like switch games and drive your car.
[8214.74 → 8216.20] Yeah.
[8217.46 → 8219.46] Whereas if I have, or have a phone.
[8221.22 → 8225.80] Well, wireless internet could still have like no rechargeable text.
[8227.46 → 8229.26] So no, no, I picked rechargeable batteries.
[8229.44 → 8229.70] No, no, no.
[8229.70 → 8232.92] I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying like, yeah, you wouldn't have internet on your
[8232.92 → 8235.40] phone, but like, what would your phone be like with no rechargeable batteries?
[8235.42 → 8236.56] It would make phone calls.
[8237.68 → 8241.18] But what would your, your cell phone, no rechargeable batteries.
[8241.44 → 8241.70] No, no.
[8241.76 → 8242.92] I pick rechargeable batteries.
[8242.92 → 8244.78] No, I know I'm talking about the alternative.
[8244.98 → 8245.62] We're too tired.
[8246.16 → 8247.38] Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[8247.48 → 8249.14] Well, well, the alternative sucks.
[8249.14 → 8252.86] I tried to, I tried to snap back, and it went like, you wouldn't have internet on your phone.
[8252.92 → 8254.50] And then I realized, hold on a second.
[8255.02 → 8256.26] You might not have a phone.
[8256.40 → 8256.88] Oh, I'd have a phone.
[8256.88 → 8261.90] Because I don't think it would be super reasonable to have completely disposable batteries for
[8261.90 → 8262.42] your phone.
[8262.68 → 8262.98] Oh yeah.
[8263.04 → 8263.86] No, no wireless.
[8264.10 → 8264.38] Oh wait.
[8264.52 → 8265.40] So hold on a second.
[8265.82 → 8266.04] Yeah.
[8266.14 → 8266.38] Okay.
[8266.46 → 8268.88] No rechargeable batteries is not a viable option.
[8269.42 → 8270.22] We're in agreement.
[8270.72 → 8271.08] Okay.
[8271.18 → 8272.48] See, I thought you were debating me.
[8272.92 → 8273.40] No.
[8276.94 → 8277.54] That's all right.
[8277.54 → 8278.58] Let's wrap it up here, boys.
[8280.24 → 8281.22] Oh man.
[8281.84 → 8282.32] So many.
[8284.64 → 8286.32] Sharp 2K was like, who's on first?
[8286.90 → 8287.84] Oh, a few people said it.
[8287.92 → 8288.06] Okay.
[8288.90 → 8289.60] That's funny.
[8290.68 → 8290.96] All right.
[8290.98 → 8292.80] I'm just going to text reply this one.
[8293.06 → 8296.18] Oh, I think we both just replied to the European warehouse one.
[8296.24 → 8296.90] Hopefully someday.
[8297.04 → 8297.30] Okay.
[8297.30 → 8297.74] Okay.
[8297.74 → 8298.50] Um, okay.
[8298.58 → 8298.82] Hold on.
[8298.86 → 8299.00] Sorry.
[8299.08 → 8299.34] One sec.
[8299.62 → 8303.58] There's some people in, in float plane chat talking about the, the re-release of the Atari
[8303.58 → 8304.86] 2600 plus.
[8305.44 → 8305.74] Um.
[8305.74 → 8306.86] I thought it's just a prop.
[8306.86 → 8310.18] Isn't it just like a piece of furniture?
[8310.18 → 8310.92] People are saying it works.
[8311.04 → 8315.14] Is this just like, is this just like an FPGA?
[8316.48 → 8316.80] Probably.
[8317.76 → 8318.82] That's what I am.
[8318.82 → 8319.80] It might even not be that.
[8319.86 → 8320.74] It might just be an emulator.
[8321.80 → 8325.16] It doesn't use an it uses an ARM CPU.
[8325.78 → 8325.98] So.
[8327.20 → 8327.64] Probably.
[8327.76 → 8327.96] Yes.
[8329.64 → 8330.04] Okay.
[8330.40 → 8331.42] It comes with a cartridge.
[8331.90 → 8335.12] Does it, does it play the old cartridges?
[8337.52 → 8338.42] I don't know, man.
[8340.08 → 8340.32] Does.
[8341.18 → 8342.70] Are people asking for this?
[8342.74 → 8346.42] Is it hard to find an Atari 2600 emulator and play the games if you really want to?
[8347.84 → 8349.50] Some, some people definitely want the hardware.
[8349.86 → 8350.28] That's fair.
[8350.50 → 8350.82] That's fair.
[8350.82 → 8351.74] It looks really cool.
[8352.28 → 8352.54] So I.
[8352.54 → 8356.54] Oh, it looks like I've got another curated here.
[8357.66 → 8358.02] Uh.
[8358.18 → 8363.10] DLSS has been a net positive for gaming in general, in my honest opinion.
[8363.30 → 8368.86] But I have seen a couple videos recently suggesting it's becoming a requirement for games to be
[8368.86 → 8369.32] playable.
[8369.70 → 8372.08] Thoughts on DLSS being a necessity.
[8373.02 → 8378.20] Sorry, just before you even say, before you respond to that, apparently it does play Atari 2600
[8378.20 → 8379.78] and 7800 game cartridges.
[8380.18 → 8380.62] Pretty cool.
[8380.84 → 8381.44] That's pretty cool.
[8381.58 → 8381.72] Yeah.
[8382.54 → 8383.06] Um.
[8383.72 → 8384.96] DLSS being a necessity?
[8386.58 → 8391.00] Yeah, they're just so unoptimized or graphics require so much stuff.
[8391.22 → 8391.44] Yeah.
[8391.60 → 8391.76] Yeah.
[8391.82 → 8395.62] There are a lot of games coming out right now that are basically just like, yeah, if you
[8395.62 → 8399.30] don't have an RTX 4090, good luck running this at, you know, 4K60.
[8399.30 → 8400.44] Um.
[8401.08 → 8406.30] So if you have anything other than that, you're basically relying on DLSS to get playable frame
[8406.30 → 8406.64] rates.
[8406.84 → 8407.54] 1440p.
[8407.54 → 8409.06] Like, smooth frame rates.
[8409.14 → 8409.36] Yeah.
[8410.02 → 8410.58] Um.
[8410.58 → 8411.04] It's inevitable.
[8411.04 → 8411.08] Um.
[8411.08 → 8411.58] Um.
[8411.58 → 8411.60] Um.
[8411.60 → 8412.10] Yeah.
[8412.10 → 8412.14] Um.
[8412.14 → 8413.08] It's inevitable.
[8413.08 → 8413.72] Um.
[8413.72 → 8419.32] I mean, look at how much the pace of GPU development.
[8419.32 → 8427.78] GPU raw performance improvement has declined from like a year-over-year standpoint.
[8427.78 → 8428.18] Uh.
[8428.18 → 8433.10] I mean, it used to be we would get new generations of GPUs once a year.
[8433.82 → 8437.76] Now we're lucky to get a new generation of GPUs every two years, three years.
[8437.76 → 8438.76] Um.
[8439.76 → 8445.16] And honestly, like looking at how much money NVIDIA is making on AI crap right now, like
[8445.16 → 8446.52] billions and billions and billions.
[8446.52 → 8455.50] They, we may be moving into the end game of NVIDIA caring at all about consumer graphics.
[8455.70 → 8457.06] I don't know what to say, man.
[8457.34 → 8462.26] Because yes, it's still a significant portion of their revenue, but it is so much less profitable
[8462.26 → 8466.34] and it is so much more work and everyone kind of hates them for it.
[8466.34 → 8469.56] If I'm sitting there, I'm, I'm Jensen right now.
[8469.62 → 8470.64] I'm wearing a leather jacket.
[8470.88 → 8474.58] I'm sitting here in my beautiful kitchen going.
[8478.00 → 8478.64] F*** them.
[8480.14 → 8482.22] Why am I even, why am I even bothering?
[8482.88 → 8488.90] I can make way less money and have everyone be mad at me, or I can make way more money and
[8488.90 → 8489.50] everything's cool.
[8490.24 → 8490.68] Yeah.
[8491.28 → 8491.58] Yeah.
[8493.58 → 8494.72] Unfortunate situation.
[8494.72 → 8501.56] I, I, I commented before about how like, we just keep cycling into like exactly what
[8501.56 → 8503.38] would be the most beneficial for NVIDIA.
[8503.50 → 8508.86] I feel like that's like, if you want to figure out like just investments in general, just figure
[8508.86 → 8512.70] out like what, what would be the most beneficial for NVIDIA to happen next in the world?
[8512.80 → 8514.60] And just like plan based off that.
[8514.60 → 8514.80] I know, right?
[8515.22 → 8518.94] Uh, because like cryptocurrency blowing up, and then you see cryptocurrency going down and
[8518.94 → 8519.86] we're all like, yeah.
[8519.86 → 8522.40] And then they're just like the next best thing.
[8522.70 → 8524.14] Now it's hyper corporate.
[8524.52 → 8529.12] I mean, it's not, it's, it's, it's clearly not an accident at this point.
[8529.20 → 8530.08] You got to give them credit.
[8530.22 → 8532.78] They have played the game extremely well.
[8532.78 → 8534.36] Yeah.
[8534.76 → 8539.24] They were out there investing in machine vision and machine learning and general purpose computing
[8539.24 → 8539.96] on the GPU.
[8541.00 → 8542.70] They, there was a clear vision.
[8543.82 → 8545.70] Um, last merch message.
[8546.46 → 8548.70] Would you do a video about float plane tech?
[8548.78 → 8552.26] I work in a similar space and especially HDR can be super tricky to get right.
[8552.26 → 8561.18] I think the challenge is that it would be hard to fit float planes, like a tech overview of
[8561.18 → 8562.46] float plane into a video.
[8562.60 → 8567.42] Like if we, if we do anything for float plane tech, it will probably be, uh, like a transcoding
[8567.42 → 8567.74] server.
[8567.90 → 8568.76] We've talked about that before.
[8570.84 → 8571.24] Yeah.
[8571.48 → 8571.62] Okay.
[8571.62 → 8575.74] That would mostly just be like, like an onsite, like trans, transcoding.
[8575.88 → 8580.14] This is a really cool server because it's really powerful and this is what we're going
[8580.14 → 8580.92] to use it for.
[8580.92 → 8583.94] And then we'd have to actually do that and not steal it from you guys this time.
[8584.14 → 8584.46] Yeah.
[8585.14 → 8585.84] That'd be cool.
[8586.08 → 8586.34] Yeah.
[8586.34 → 8591.40] We tried to do that before and live while one of my, uh, team members was working on
[8591.40 → 8591.56] it.
[8591.96 → 8594.88] It was powered down, so someone could take parts out of it.
[8594.96 → 8597.52] And we were like, Hmm, let's not do this.
[8599.78 → 8600.18] Anyway.
[8601.62 → 8602.16] All right.
[8602.26 → 8602.70] Cool.
[8602.82 → 8603.88] I'm happy to get out of here.
[8603.96 → 8607.84] Just, I know this is a short show, but it's, it's 1230.
[8608.86 → 8610.36] Thanks for tuning in though, guys.
[8610.50 → 8610.66] Yeah.
[8610.92 → 8612.72] We will see you next week.
[8613.50 → 8614.36] Same bad time.
[8615.30 → 8616.58] Hopefully a different, hopefully earlier.
[8616.78 → 8618.40] Um, same bad channel.
[8618.78 → 8618.92] Yeah.
[8619.22 → 8619.66] Bye.
[8622.66 → 8623.56] Appreciate you all.
[8623.98 → 8628.38] Bye.
[8629.12 → 8629.46] Sure.
[8630.28 → 8631.22] Bye.
[8631.42 → 8632.42] Bye.
[8632.42 → 8632.56] Bye.
[8632.66 → 8633.20] Bye.
[8633.70 → 8634.12] Bye.
[8634.36 → 8635.24] Bye.
[8635.60 → 8637.08] Bye.
[8645.26 → 8645.58] Bye.
[8645.58 → 8645.74] Bye.
[8645.74 → 8645.82] Bye.
[8645.82 → 8645.84] Bye.
[8645.90 → 8646.78] Bye.
[8646.80 → 8647.38] Bye.
[8647.38 → 8647.50] Bye.
[8647.50 → 8647.62] Bye.
[8647.78 → 8648.28] Bye.
[8648.28 → 8649.40] Bye.
[8649.40 → 8649.44] Bye.
[8649.50 → 8650.50] Bye.
[8650.56 → 8651.20] Bye.
[8651.42 → 8652.02] Bye.
