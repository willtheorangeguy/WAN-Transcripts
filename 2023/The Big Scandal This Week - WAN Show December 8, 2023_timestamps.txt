*Note*
For a while from now I won't be able to timestamp on time, my 1st gen Ryzen has been struggling on and off with consistent BSODs & crashes, and I can't really go to a computer cafe at 5 AM. Will have to timestamp on my Note 8 for a while. Thanks for being patient again!
Side note: donations are in my channel's about page.

@LinusTechTips
Ok, I admit, I wrote a comment stated that Linus will never watch 1995 movie Hackers again,
but now seam's like he will @2:51:39 so, sorry may be I was wrong.

P.S.
please make sure to use 2023 Hackers - Collector's Edition 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray
coz it contains NEW 4K Scan And Restoration Of The Original Camera Negative HDR 10 Compatible 
and Bonus Features Including Director's Commentary audio track and separate Interview With Director Iain Softley and Cast Members
called The Keyboard Cowboys - A Look Back at Hackers
timestamp 00-59-10 "...It one of the peculiar things that Hackers kinda taking twenty years to come to be accepted as a cult classic..."
timestamp 00-59-26 "...It was one of the weird experiences, you sit in the screening room, and you both watch a movie,
and you both came out  going  - you know it was great! wasn't? - and everybody else in the room kinda didn't see same film that you did - but sorta  twenty years - later they did"
