[0.76 --> 6.34]  What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN Show! It's the show where anything can happen.
[6.98 --> 11.46]  Controversy, hot takes, controversy, and even hotter takes.
[11.48 --> 16.58]  And even hotter takes! You'll find it all here. We've got some great topics for you guys today.
[16.92 --> 21.66]  The PlayStation VR 2 launches next week, so we're going to be running you guys through.
[21.98 --> 24.08]  Oh no, you're going to have to do this topic.
[24.54 --> 29.26]  Because, full disclosure, I have already tried it and I don't know what is or isn't under embargo.
[29.26 --> 31.64]  So, we'll figure that out. Cool!
[32.00 --> 34.80]  Also, sorry.
[36.14 --> 42.14]  I mean, I had looked into this a little bit, but I didn't know the price.
[42.86 --> 48.76]  You can pay $144 a year for Facebook.
[49.28 --> 49.50]  Sorry.
[52.00 --> 55.24]  Okay, I'm sorry. What else we got?
[55.24 --> 59.88]  Uh, Linus rage quit a video game.
[60.10 --> 60.46]  Wait, what?
[60.46 --> 62.56]  Did you even know that Linus rage quit video games?
[62.68 --> 63.06]  Did you have-
[63.06 --> 64.28]  Did you know that he even played video games?
[64.40 --> 66.70]  Did you- you picked that as a headline topic?
[66.72 --> 68.64]  Everything else sucked. Nothing happened this week.
[68.74 --> 71.96]  I don't know if you paid attention to the news all week, but nothing happened this week.
[72.06 --> 74.20]  That was an if you're desperate topic.
[74.46 --> 75.30]  And I'm desperate.
[75.40 --> 75.84]  Alright, fair enough.
[75.84 --> 77.58]  So I picked it. It's a great topic.
[77.68 --> 78.12]  Okay, what else we got?
[78.12 --> 79.68]  For if I'm desperate, which I am.
[79.68 --> 84.44]  The other one is going to be, oh, I don't know, Amazon expands into telehealth.
[86.16 --> 89.78]  Really? Not YouTube ads, dubbing podcasts, and 1080p premium?
[90.16 --> 92.94]  Is that more interesting? We've already talked about 1080p premium.
[93.04 --> 94.84]  No, we talked about 4K paid.
[95.42 --> 97.24]  I'm pretty sure we included 1080p premium.
[97.66 --> 97.82]  Probably.
[97.82 --> 99.58]  Or was that just something that we knew at the time?
[99.88 --> 100.50]  I don't know.
[100.72 --> 102.28]  Because I definitely knew that at the time.
[102.42 --> 103.20]  Let's roll the intro.
[103.20 --> 108.64]  Dan?
[108.64 --> 108.98]  Oh.
[128.86 --> 130.60]  The show is brought to you by The Ridge.
[132.70 --> 133.06]  Squarespace.
[134.14 --> 135.12]  And JumpCloud.
[135.60 --> 136.24]  Hey, guess what?
[136.38 --> 139.74]  You guys get to witness a short production meeting.
[142.60 --> 145.94]  Yeah, they can't hear you if you're way over there, so that's a challenge.
[146.24 --> 147.04]  I don't think he cares.
[149.54 --> 152.00]  I can try to do the PSVR.
[152.44 --> 153.78]  I think the phone should be bigger.
[155.18 --> 158.86]  And I can't tell that that's real water tubes.
[159.00 --> 161.14]  If there's anything we can do about that, that would be great.
[161.14 --> 168.42]  As for the GPU challenge, yeah, yeah, sure.
[168.52 --> 169.16]  That looks good.
[169.48 --> 170.46]  I'm checking that one.
[170.80 --> 172.12]  Oh, you want me to watch Appy's?
[172.36 --> 172.80]  No, no.
[172.88 --> 174.12]  I wanted an audio pickup.
[174.12 --> 176.20]  Wait, you want me to do an audio pickup?
[176.56 --> 177.06]  Real quick.
[177.38 --> 178.00]  He said that.
[178.08 --> 178.92]  Oh, good gravy.
[179.26 --> 179.52]  Okay.
[180.00 --> 181.20]  Luke's going to get the show started.
[181.40 --> 181.90]  See ya.
[182.96 --> 184.04]  Oh, so I'm just going to do it here?
[185.08 --> 185.76]  Okay, perfect.
[185.88 --> 186.94]  Then we'll just, yeah, that's great.
[187.00 --> 187.88]  Then we'll just get the show started.
[188.22 --> 188.58]  All right.
[188.58 --> 189.72]  Our first topic today?
[190.60 --> 193.20]  So sometimes when the show is late, that's what's happening.
[194.30 --> 195.38]  Yeah, this sort of thing.
[195.60 --> 197.14]  What was our headline thing today?
[198.20 --> 199.14]  Yeah, you switched it to PlayStation.
[199.14 --> 199.92]  Console Gamer, yes.
[200.56 --> 201.58]  PlayStation VR 2.
[202.28 --> 204.98]  Hey, are reviews up yet?
[205.06 --> 206.08]  Or like, what's the deal?
[206.16 --> 207.02]  What are we allowed to say?
[207.14 --> 207.46]  It's out?
[207.60 --> 208.04]  It's out.
[208.16 --> 209.02]  People can buy it.
[209.08 --> 209.64]  People have it.
[209.70 --> 210.76]  Then I can talk about it, right?
[210.84 --> 211.04]  Yeah.
[211.24 --> 211.98]  I tried it.
[212.10 --> 212.88]  Have you tried it?
[212.92 --> 213.14]  No.
[213.76 --> 214.74]  Oh, there it is.
[214.86 --> 215.10]  Yes.
[215.68 --> 216.36]  PSVR 2.
[218.46 --> 222.30]  Luke, it's enough to make me want a PlayStation.
[222.72 --> 223.02]  Really?
[223.14 --> 225.94]  I want a PlayStation for the first time since the PS2.
[226.86 --> 227.26]  Wow.
[227.44 --> 227.62]  Yeah.
[227.70 --> 230.56]  Like, I wanted a PS2 because I wanted to play like Final Fantasy.
[230.56 --> 234.88]  Have you tried the new Facebook one?
[235.28 --> 235.88]  The thinner one?
[236.26 --> 236.38]  Yes.
[236.38 --> 237.16]  The like professional one?
[237.22 --> 237.44]  Yes.
[237.56 --> 238.26]  And this is better?
[238.46 --> 239.82]  Oh, dude.
[240.04 --> 240.32]  Oh.
[240.50 --> 241.18]  It's OLED.
[241.98 --> 242.36]  Oh.
[242.36 --> 243.40]  It's OLED.
[243.70 --> 244.84]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[244.84 --> 245.00]  It's OLED.
[245.10 --> 245.92]  That's actually pretty sick.
[246.12 --> 248.14]  I remember seeing that in the specs and being like, damn.
[248.58 --> 249.06]  That's cool.
[249.34 --> 253.62]  It's exactly as damn as you think it is.
[254.92 --> 256.02]  You can have a look.
[256.24 --> 256.54]  Am I trying this?
[256.58 --> 256.74]  No.
[256.86 --> 257.78]  I mean, you can try it on.
[257.88 --> 258.02]  Okay.
[258.06 --> 259.42]  I'll show you the adjustments.
[259.88 --> 260.06]  Okay.
[260.12 --> 261.20]  So there's two adjustments.
[261.50 --> 262.44]  This button at the back.
[262.48 --> 262.96]  Pretty normal.
[263.16 --> 263.90]  Pulls it like that.
[264.00 --> 264.22]  Okay.
[264.44 --> 265.56]  And twist to tighten.
[265.78 --> 267.24]  That do be how your headsets work.
[267.24 --> 268.18]  And then there's one here.
[268.80 --> 270.34]  That goes like that.
[270.46 --> 270.62]  Okay.
[270.62 --> 271.72]  So a little something like that.
[271.72 --> 273.28]  Oh.
[273.84 --> 274.82]  The screen though.
[275.22 --> 275.74]  The screen.
[275.94 --> 281.44]  We've got a full review coming soon where we try a bunch of different games and do like
[281.44 --> 284.70]  a short comparison against what kind of VR setup you could build.
[285.46 --> 288.30]  Like a PC VR setup that you could build for the same price.
[288.48 --> 291.40]  But this thing is exciting.
[292.06 --> 293.26]  It came out this week.
[293.26 --> 296.76]  Last week, Sony released a full official teardown showing off the new hardware.
[297.26 --> 302.76]  And based on the specs and based on my experience, the PSVR 2 is a significant jump.
[303.22 --> 306.54]  4.1 megapixels per eye versus 1 megapixel per eye.
[306.90 --> 307.82]  HDR display.
[308.08 --> 308.24]  Yeah.
[308.52 --> 310.36]  OLED, HDR, Luke.
[310.84 --> 311.94]  HDR, OLED.
[312.40 --> 312.76]  That's cool.
[312.76 --> 315.38]  And pupil tracking.
[316.38 --> 317.40]  Pupil tracking.
[317.70 --> 318.42]  That's right.
[318.94 --> 320.00]  Foveated rendering.
[322.00 --> 329.46]  Games look so good in spite of the, on paper, lower graphical performance of the PlayStation
[329.46 --> 331.62]  5 compared to a top tier PC.
[334.02 --> 339.26]  This puts it miles beyond anything else that's in an equivalent price range, which is $550
[339.26 --> 341.32]  in terms of visual quality.
[342.08 --> 344.72]  And I got to tell you this.
[345.28 --> 345.46]  Okay.
[346.02 --> 347.16]  I expected.
[347.42 --> 350.68]  I've never actually used eye tracking and foveated rendering before.
[350.80 --> 350.88]  Yeah.
[350.88 --> 355.14]  I have used eye tracking before and I know that it's like, can be pretty fast.
[355.62 --> 356.74]  It can be pretty okay.
[356.88 --> 361.48]  It can pull at rates of well in excess of a hundred Hertz, which is, you know, pretty good.
[361.88 --> 366.54]  But the eye moves faster than a lot of eye tracking technology.
[366.54 --> 371.78]  And my concern was that with foveated rendering, which I guess I haven't explained yet, what
[371.78 --> 375.64]  they're doing is they're tracking where you're looking, rendering just that spot.
[375.72 --> 380.18]  I think it's what, 4% of your field of view is actually high res.
[380.18 --> 380.88]  Yeah, it's small.
[380.98 --> 383.34]  And then everything else is kind of junk tier.
[383.58 --> 386.06]  Even if it was in focus, it would be junk tier, right?
[386.98 --> 391.24]  So what it does is it takes that spot you're looking at, renders it at higher quality, and
[391.24 --> 392.82]  then everything else kind of goes to crap.
[393.34 --> 400.16]  And I couldn't tell if it was working from inside the headset because it's so fast.
[400.88 --> 402.18]  And Alex and...
[402.76 --> 403.10]  Oh, right.
[403.16 --> 407.74]  So if you like think something in your peripheral is poorly rendered, so you go to look at it,
[407.78 --> 409.44]  it's nicely rendered by the time you get there.
[409.44 --> 411.24]  And I thought it just wasn't working.
[411.36 --> 414.68]  I thought everything was just rendering at full quality because I'd like intentionally
[414.68 --> 415.52]  look, right?
[415.62 --> 416.06]  So I...
[416.06 --> 419.02]  But then Alex was my spotter.
[419.42 --> 422.64]  And he had a TV set up capturing the experience.
[422.64 --> 423.00]  Okay.
[423.38 --> 428.72]  And we played a little game where I said I was in Horizon, whatever the Horizon experience
[428.72 --> 428.76]  is called.
[428.76 --> 430.20]  Oh, he had to try to guess where you were looking?
[430.32 --> 432.54]  He had to guess where I was looking based on the render quality.
[432.54 --> 433.62]  And he's just like, yeah, there.
[434.16 --> 434.70]  And there.
[434.78 --> 434.98]  And there.
[435.10 --> 436.86]  And so I'd be like, I'd like, I'd look, look.
[437.08 --> 439.78]  And I'd try to, I'd try to beat it and see the lower...
[439.78 --> 441.44]  I couldn't do it.
[441.74 --> 442.56]  That's kind of cool.
[442.64 --> 443.66]  It's incredible.
[444.00 --> 445.10]  Horizon Call of the Mountain.
[445.22 --> 445.50]  Is that it?
[445.60 --> 445.76]  Yeah.
[445.80 --> 445.94]  Yeah.
[445.94 --> 446.08]  Yeah.
[446.08 --> 446.60]  That's the one.
[446.60 --> 452.82]  And it is, it is, oh man, it's just, it's moving in the complete opposite direction
[452.82 --> 454.76]  of what MET is doing with their VR headsets.
[455.20 --> 462.10]  It's, it's no, unapologetically a non-standalone VR headset.
[462.32 --> 464.30]  It's the best hardware they could build into a headset.
[464.54 --> 464.92]  And you know what?
[464.92 --> 465.24]  It's still tethered.
[465.32 --> 465.72]  It's not wireless.
[465.72 --> 466.78]  It's tethered to a box.
[467.26 --> 467.90]  Deal with it.
[467.90 --> 470.50]  Because that's what it takes to have this kind of fidelity.
[471.12 --> 473.00]  I mean, that doesn't mean they haven't streamlined it.
[473.00 --> 478.02]  The original PSVR had a large breakout box and a complex AV setup, whereas this is a
[478.02 --> 479.68]  single USB-C cable.
[480.08 --> 482.64]  Is it possible to turn off the eye tracking?
[483.36 --> 483.80]  I don't know.
[483.90 --> 484.40]  Why would you want to?
[484.80 --> 487.52]  People with lazy eyes or other...
[487.52 --> 488.24]  Oh, that's a good point.
[488.34 --> 488.90]  I didn't think of that.
[488.96 --> 489.12]  Okay.
[489.18 --> 490.14]  I need to do that audio pickup.
[490.56 --> 492.96]  Maybe talk about, I don't know, comfort or something.
[493.60 --> 494.84]  And you can also...
[494.84 --> 495.04]  Comfort was good.
[495.04 --> 501.28]  It has attached earbuds, which I'm not actually as much of a fan of, because what if you have
[501.28 --> 502.80]  more than one person at your house that uses it?
[503.72 --> 505.16]  Uh, or something.
[505.74 --> 510.34]  I would prefer the, like, the disc headphone things that I believe the Index has.
[511.04 --> 514.84]  Um, those were totally fine, in my opinion.
[515.22 --> 515.66]  I don't...
[515.66 --> 516.42]  I'm not a huge fan of that.
[516.64 --> 519.16]  But general comfort and stuff, actually quite good.
[519.52 --> 521.26]  Um, the earbuds come off.
[521.66 --> 525.66]  Yeah, unless they have, like, built-in headphones that replace it.
[525.66 --> 528.96]  I'm not a huge fan of wearing other headphones with it, either.
[528.96 --> 535.60]  If they have additional headphones that you can buy that come with it or design for it, then that's cool.
[535.70 --> 536.30]  But if not...
[536.30 --> 540.52]  I don't know, personally.
[540.98 --> 541.96]  Uh, but yeah, comfort's good.
[541.96 --> 546.70]  This shroud, this, like, rubbery shroud, it's got a 3.5mm jack.
[546.92 --> 548.72]  Yeah, that doesn't solve it for me, personally.
[549.34 --> 550.58]  I don't want earbuds while I'm playing.
[551.04 --> 553.50]  Um, but that's a preference thing.
[553.72 --> 554.42]  Yeah, they said that.
[554.68 --> 555.68]  I'm not super into that.
[555.84 --> 557.16]  Well, here's the thing, right?
[557.16 --> 563.80]  Though, the alternate solutions are either what Meta's doing with garbage tier audio.
[563.88 --> 564.90]  It sounds so bad.
[565.10 --> 567.72]  Or what Valve's doing, which presumably is expensive.
[568.44 --> 568.78]  Oh, okay.
[568.88 --> 571.74]  Like, the Index costs twice as much as this.
[572.24 --> 572.80]  Still!
[573.52 --> 575.18]  And it doesn't even have an OLED display.
[576.04 --> 576.24]  Man.
[576.74 --> 578.56]  And, oh, the screen door...
[578.56 --> 579.26]  You're gonna break them out.
[579.38 --> 580.54]  The screen door effect?
[581.16 --> 581.60]  Negligible.
[582.38 --> 582.98]  My understanding is...
[582.98 --> 584.00]  You can still see it, I'm assuming?
[584.00 --> 590.42]  There are actually headsets out there that are slightly higher resolution, but it's real good.
[590.88 --> 591.46]  It's real good.
[591.60 --> 595.70]  And, oh, just the persistence is so low.
[596.56 --> 599.20]  Like, I got the headset on, I'm going like this, and I'm like, wow!
[600.06 --> 601.00]  This is amazing!
[601.36 --> 602.38]  There's, like, no smearing!
[603.20 --> 604.58]  I'm just gonna go like this!
[604.62 --> 605.52]  This is my new game!
[607.54 --> 608.90]  No external beacons?
[609.48 --> 610.12]  No, no.
[610.20 --> 610.62]  How's the tracking?
[610.84 --> 611.40]  It's okay.
[611.40 --> 618.50]  I hope that Valve stays full purist and sticks with outside-in tracking.
[619.00 --> 623.94]  I literally wired up my house for their base stations.
[624.52 --> 633.18]  My ceiling in my rec room has 12-volt power run inside it so that I can always have four base stations.
[633.42 --> 636.58]  I am a one-of-a-kind.
[636.58 --> 639.24]  I suspect nobody else has actually done that.
[639.66 --> 642.92]  But that's how committed I am to outside-in tracking.
[643.16 --> 648.34]  It really is superior from a performance standpoint, but it's inconvenient.
[648.34 --> 655.62]  I will say, for a tethered experience, the single USB-C cable with no breakout box is pretty sweet.
[655.62 --> 671.38]  Because I'm used to, like, this, like, thick cord of, like, three different cables coming out that has to plug into some, like, junction box at some point, and then go into your computer and, like, three different plugs to the point where you might be, like, maxing out the USB on the back of your motherboard, whatever.
[671.38 --> 671.72]  Exactly.
[671.72 --> 672.24]  Like, blah, blah, blah.
[672.32 --> 672.96]  It's super annoying.
[673.22 --> 675.20]  Just having one cable is really cool.
[675.36 --> 676.48]  I'm totally down with that.
[676.48 --> 677.28]  Yeah.
[677.48 --> 677.98]  Oh, man.
[678.06 --> 678.98]  120 hertz.
[679.82 --> 680.00]  Oh.
[680.34 --> 681.40]  IPD adjustments.
[682.00 --> 684.58]  It weighs less than the previous one, and it did feel light.
[684.74 --> 686.34]  Actual IPD adjustments.
[687.22 --> 687.80]  Very cool.
[687.94 --> 688.12]  Yeah.
[688.28 --> 689.56]  I'm, man, I'm excited.
[689.88 --> 690.24]  However.
[690.38 --> 691.20]  How are the new controllers?
[691.72 --> 691.96]  Great.
[692.48 --> 692.90]  They're right here.
[693.10 --> 693.60]  Oh, hey.
[693.72 --> 694.16]  What's up?
[694.76 --> 694.94]  Yeah.
[695.02 --> 695.66]  I'm, uh, mm.
[695.92 --> 696.24]  Okay.
[696.46 --> 697.36]  They're a little heavy.
[697.72 --> 699.64]  Um, like, rotationally.
[699.68 --> 699.88]  Ooh.
[700.22 --> 702.02]  I find that, uh.
[702.02 --> 702.84]  My hand's too big.
[702.84 --> 703.58]  This is kind of bulky.
[703.58 --> 710.24]  And there are definitely some things about the headset that are Japanese designed.
[711.02 --> 712.14]  That's one of them.
[712.28 --> 712.56]  Got it.
[712.58 --> 715.04]  And I personally found that my.
[715.28 --> 716.56]  Oh, I actually find that very uncomfortable.
[716.94 --> 721.96]  Roman nose, uh, was not super compatible with the headset.
[722.36 --> 724.52]  You, you tried sliding it out though?
[724.54 --> 725.96]  Yeah, but I don't like that.
[726.36 --> 732.90]  I like to have the headset in tight against my face because I, I play games that require
[732.90 --> 734.04]  a lot of moving around.
[734.24 --> 735.18]  And light leak sucks.
[735.44 --> 737.80]  And, well, the light leak is really good on it actually.
[737.80 --> 740.76]  I did notice because the rubber thingy, but still, that is usually a reason why you
[740.76 --> 741.24]  want it closer.
[741.48 --> 746.94]  But for me, a big part of why I want it closer is just so that when I move my head, I, I'm
[746.94 --> 749.88]  not, um, I'm not feeling that drag, right?
[749.92 --> 750.54]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[750.78 --> 755.06]  Uh, it's, it's like less leverage for it to move around on my face.
[755.06 --> 755.34]  Right.
[755.70 --> 757.30]  And so I, um,
[757.30 --> 759.28]  No, it kind of, someone said try pushing buttons.
[759.28 --> 759.56]  Yeah.
[759.60 --> 764.92]  Even the trigger is like hard because my, the, the bone of this part of my pinky.
[764.98 --> 765.42]  Luke cam.
[766.32 --> 766.60]  Yeah.
[766.80 --> 769.58]  So the, the bone of that part of my, you can, can I show you?
[769.58 --> 769.70]  Yeah.
[769.70 --> 770.54]  I can, I can tell.
[770.54 --> 773.36]  It's colliding and like bending my pinky in.
[773.36 --> 776.18]  So even pulling the trigger feels super awkward.
[776.18 --> 781.16]  Cause if you see the natural position of where my finger goes on, it isn't like up there.
[781.16 --> 782.58]  Like that's extremely uncomfortable.
[782.58 --> 785.92]  It's like down here because it's cranking my hand down.
[785.92 --> 790.84]  And then even to get to this thumbstick is like my thumbs on full tilt.
[791.58 --> 792.48]  So I don't know.
[792.54 --> 797.14]  I could do it, but, um, not, not the biggest fan.
[797.30 --> 799.66]  Bixby asks, what product doesn't have IPD adjustments?
[799.82 --> 800.34]  Quest 2.
[801.00 --> 801.30]  Yeah.
[801.44 --> 802.34]  They're, they're digital.
[802.48 --> 802.94]  They're fake.
[802.94 --> 803.42]  Yeah.
[803.48 --> 807.66]  Whereas the PSVR 2 has proper, uh, IPD adjustment.
[809.60 --> 815.34]  Um, Alpha's Intel says, Luke, Bing chat GPT knows you were talking about it on WAN show.
[815.34 --> 817.60]  It asks you not to be disappointed in its abilities.
[818.66 --> 819.06]  Yeah.
[819.16 --> 820.98]  Well, I, I think I talked about this last show.
[821.14 --> 826.20]  I won't get into it too much, but, uh, I, I mentioned how it now has a form of memory
[826.20 --> 831.86]  because people are posting, uh, conversations that they have with it online and it can search
[831.86 --> 832.22]  the internet.
[832.22 --> 832.52]  Right.
[832.52 --> 834.02]  So it has a form of memory.
[834.02 --> 836.26]  It can see conversations that it has had in the future.
[836.26 --> 840.74]  Not all of them, just only ones that people have posted online and it can see transcriptions
[840.74 --> 841.28]  of different things.
[841.28 --> 847.74]  So if we have closed captions for this video for WAN show, it might be able to have access
[847.74 --> 848.04]  to that.
[848.04 --> 852.46]  It can't watch the video, but it could watch a transcript and it could see people discussing
[852.46 --> 853.90]  what we said on the show as well.
[853.90 --> 855.70]  If there's text versions of that.
[855.70 --> 859.02]  So it would be, I would expect that it would be aware of that.
[860.56 --> 864.24]  I don't know if you want to call it awareness or I expect it would be able to search that
[864.24 --> 864.52]  up.
[864.70 --> 865.56]  But yeah.
[865.56 --> 867.36]  Oh, okay.
[867.36 --> 868.12]  This is interesting.
[868.28 --> 872.36]  I was just poking into people are talking about using the PSVR two on a PC.
[872.36 --> 881.18]  But the creator of the IVRE driver, which is a way to use the original PSVR on a PC, basically
[881.18 --> 885.44]  says, yeah, I don't think this is going to be that easy.
[885.66 --> 886.72]  It goes, you'll be wasting your money.
[886.82 --> 890.16]  There's no guarantee you could ever use it on a PC and quite a good chance you won't be
[890.16 --> 890.56]  able to.
[890.56 --> 894.02]  The original PSVR is electronically equivalent to a monitor.
[895.26 --> 898.18]  So it is relatively simple to get a video signal up on it.
[898.54 --> 902.06]  Reading sensors, et cetera, took a lot of reverse engineering and at least a year from release
[902.06 --> 903.32]  before anyone figured that out.
[903.50 --> 906.32]  Took a couple more years before it was usable as a PC VR headset.
[907.68 --> 907.80]  Yeah.
[907.94 --> 908.42]  Yeah.
[908.46 --> 912.56]  And it's still a work in progress with tracking controllers with the original hardware over
[912.56 --> 913.78]  five years from release.
[915.22 --> 915.66]  Wow.
[915.90 --> 916.32]  Okay.
[917.50 --> 917.78]  Yeah.
[917.78 --> 918.76]  I wouldn't expect that to be a thing.
[919.24 --> 919.52]  Yep.
[919.52 --> 920.00]  Okay.
[920.00 --> 920.96]  That's fair enough.
[921.68 --> 924.44]  I mean, it's kind of a funny thing to me.
[924.58 --> 931.06]  Like if people can use it on the PC and they want to use it on the PC, is there really no
[931.06 --> 932.48]  margin in it at $500?
[932.92 --> 935.24]  Like they couldn't just sell it as a VR headset?
[935.52 --> 937.68]  I guess that wouldn't be very PlayStation of them.
[937.76 --> 938.96]  That wouldn't be very Sony of them.
[939.62 --> 940.44]  Sort of.
[941.08 --> 946.50]  PlayStation's actually been moving a ton of games to PC and has been fairly faithful in
[946.50 --> 950.46]  regards to patching them and making sure that they actually run okay.
[950.78 --> 954.74]  Like when Horizon was one of the earlier games that they brought to PC and it was quite a
[954.74 --> 957.80]  mess when they first brought it over, but they cleaned it up.
[958.26 --> 960.14]  And as far as my understanding goes, it's pretty stable now.
[960.14 --> 964.44]  So in the past, I would definitely agree with that.
[964.44 --> 967.72]  But these days, they've actually been pretty PC friendly.
[968.44 --> 968.72]  Okay.
[969.04 --> 970.22]  Well, I guess we'll see.
[971.50 --> 971.86]  Yeah.
[972.10 --> 972.48]  I don't know.
[972.56 --> 975.54]  Conrad says it's hard to keep customers in your walled garden if you open the door.
[975.68 --> 976.76]  I mean, yeah, that's fair enough.
[977.82 --> 978.30]  True.
[978.30 --> 981.66]  Why don't we jump into our next topic?
[982.42 --> 985.70]  Who wants to pay $144 a year for Facebook?
[986.20 --> 994.08]  After the massive success of Twitter Blue, Mark Zuckerberg has his eyes set clearly on
[994.08 --> 1001.26]  generating revenue from his user base through the Meta Verified program, a monthly subscription
[1001.26 --> 1005.62]  with a cost of $12 that does what?
[1005.62 --> 1005.96]  Okay.
[1005.96 --> 1012.44]  It covers Facebook and Instagram, includes a blue badge, increased search visibility, exclusive
[1012.44 --> 1019.66]  stickers for stories, direct customer support, and 100 free stars, a currency that can be
[1019.66 --> 1021.22]  used to tip creators.
[1021.92 --> 1029.08]  There does not appear to be any reduction in ads or data mining.
[1029.94 --> 1031.62]  What a deal, Mark.
[1031.98 --> 1033.28]  Sign me up.
[1033.68 --> 1034.74]  I love it.
[1034.74 --> 1040.66]  Can we never normalize this, people?
[1041.00 --> 1042.60]  It seems to just be a brand thing.
[1042.84 --> 1043.52]  Like, never.
[1043.94 --> 1046.24]  Can we never, ever normalize this?
[1046.32 --> 1049.58]  Can we always make fun of people for paying for Twitter Blue?
[1050.06 --> 1050.40]  Please.
[1050.40 --> 1056.72]  Would you normalize it if it did do what it says at the end?
[1056.72 --> 1062.52]  If it did reduce or let's say it removed ads and removed data mining?
[1062.52 --> 1063.38]  I wouldn't believe them.
[1064.44 --> 1064.64]  Yeah.
[1064.70 --> 1065.08]  Fair enough.
[1065.30 --> 1065.56]  All right.
[1066.00 --> 1069.68]  Let's imagine that you knew without a doubt.
[1070.08 --> 1071.98]  Forget the data mining because I don't believe them.
[1073.26 --> 1075.10]  But we can talk about ads.
[1075.10 --> 1081.96]  If I never saw an ad on Facebook or Instagram again, I wouldn't pay for this because I don't
[1081.96 --> 1084.52]  remember the last time I opened up Facebook or Instagram.
[1085.02 --> 1087.76]  No offense to our dedicated viewers on Facebook.
[1087.96 --> 1088.72]  All dozens of you.
[1088.96 --> 1089.14]  Yeah.
[1089.18 --> 1090.06]  We're streaming there right now.
[1090.14 --> 1091.26]  We're streaming there right now.
[1091.26 --> 1096.18]  I don't think either of us have ever seen that page.
[1097.62 --> 1097.78]  Nope.
[1098.10 --> 1099.68]  41 people are watching on Facebook?
[1100.00 --> 1101.14]  Oh, very nice.
[1101.34 --> 1101.64]  Nice.
[1101.96 --> 1103.40]  Sup, boomers?
[1104.86 --> 1106.16]  Hello, fellow boomers.
[1107.22 --> 1107.78]  39.
[1108.34 --> 1109.82]  They're leaving in shame.
[1110.62 --> 1112.14]  And I took that personally.
[1112.20 --> 1113.34]  Don't observe us.
[1115.58 --> 1116.10]  Yeah.
[1116.20 --> 1116.64]  So Facebook.
[1117.00 --> 1118.38]  No, I wouldn't pay for it.
[1118.38 --> 1122.94]  But let's say hypothetically that it was a service I actually used and cared about.
[1123.38 --> 1124.48]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1124.54 --> 1126.16]  12 bucks a month doesn't seem that outlandish.
[1126.16 --> 1127.06]  Why would you pay for it, though?
[1127.06 --> 1128.60]  As a normal user, what does it even give you?
[1128.90 --> 1130.30]  As a company.
[1130.46 --> 1132.86]  Have you seen how many ads there are on Facebook?
[1133.54 --> 1134.06]  Oh, no.
[1134.14 --> 1135.18]  We're not talking about our.
[1135.30 --> 1136.96]  I was talking about the root thing.
[1137.02 --> 1138.32]  I was no longer talking about the ad removal.
[1138.50 --> 1139.12]  Oh, okay.
[1139.16 --> 1141.12]  So we're not talking about the real product.
[1141.32 --> 1142.98]  Or we are going back to talking about the real product.
[1142.98 --> 1143.96]  We're going back to talking about the real product.
[1143.96 --> 1144.24]  Yeah.
[1144.44 --> 1148.28]  So increased search visibility, stickers, customer support.
[1148.38 --> 1150.00]  And stars to tip creators.
[1150.00 --> 1151.66]  It's basically just stars.
[1152.04 --> 1152.48]  Yeah.
[1152.76 --> 1153.26]  I mean.
[1153.36 --> 1154.30]  If you're a normal user.
[1154.48 --> 1156.20]  What support do you need on Facebook?
[1156.22 --> 1157.54]  I mean, you use Facebook.
[1157.76 --> 1159.40]  So maybe you're not that good with computers.
[1160.24 --> 1162.24]  Maybe you just need help using websites.
[1162.60 --> 1162.86]  Hold on.
[1163.24 --> 1165.56]  I interpret that as the other way around.
[1167.10 --> 1168.32]  Direct customer support.
[1168.42 --> 1169.36]  Yeah, maybe you are right.
[1169.56 --> 1169.82]  Wow.
[1169.88 --> 1171.74]  That's an advertised major feature?
[1172.30 --> 1175.62]  I mean, if you need customer support, you should just contact them, right?
[1176.52 --> 1179.62]  I assumed that was some way that brands could interface.
[1179.84 --> 1181.00]  Yeah, maybe I've got this wrong.
[1181.24 --> 1182.84]  Maybe it's completely the other way around.
[1183.08 --> 1184.20]  I kind of hope so.
[1184.26 --> 1188.44]  Because if they're like, hey, yeah, we'll give you customer support for this thing that you're paying for.
[1188.54 --> 1191.18]  I would hope that's not a thing that they advertised.
[1192.20 --> 1192.96]  Yeah, guys.
[1193.10 --> 1194.16]  I mean, hit us up.
[1194.34 --> 1195.92]  Which one is it?
[1197.62 --> 1199.48]  Metasupport also means Instagram support.
[1199.48 --> 1204.76]  We recently lost a company Instagram account because they don't have support for unverified users.
[1205.00 --> 1206.92]  Yeah, so it sounds like it's very company focused.
[1207.62 --> 1209.20]  No, it sounds like it's user focused.
[1209.20 --> 1213.24]  If you're a user and you, like, lose your account, you should be able to get support.
[1213.76 --> 1216.10]  Yeah, but because it wasn't verified.
[1216.24 --> 1221.44]  Well, I mean, just mean anyone who lost their account, whether they're a company or an individual user, would be pretty bummed about it.
[1221.56 --> 1221.78]  Sure.
[1221.96 --> 1223.70]  And being able to contact support.
[1224.34 --> 1225.16]  That's terrible.
[1225.28 --> 1227.14]  You should just have support for users.
[1227.14 --> 1229.42]  I don't disagree.
[1229.78 --> 1230.26]  Unbelievable.
[1230.94 --> 1232.54]  This is worse than I thought.
[1233.32 --> 1234.68]  And it was already laughable.
[1235.80 --> 1236.32]  Man.
[1237.46 --> 1238.30]  Shortly after.
[1238.48 --> 1240.52]  Okay, so they're not the first to jump on this.
[1240.86 --> 1250.84]  Shortly after Twitter Blue was launched, Tumblr started selling what they called important blue internet check marks that officially do absolutely nothing for a one-time cost of $4 each.
[1250.84 --> 1253.94]  They apparently made a quarter million dollars in profit.
[1254.56 --> 1259.74]  A quarter over quarter increase of in-app purchases of 125%.
[1259.74 --> 1264.94]  As of a recent update, the check marks are now rainbow colored, apparently.
[1265.54 --> 1267.94]  Tumblr user Carpy Suns.
[1267.94 --> 1271.44]  That is actually unironically what I called them when I was a kid.
[1271.76 --> 1274.36]  You know those little Capri Sun pouch drinks?
[1274.48 --> 1276.38]  I called them Carpy Suns because I don't know.
[1276.60 --> 1278.58]  I guess I had a little bit of the dyslexia.
[1279.48 --> 1285.68]  Anyway, Carpy Suns apparently spent $120 on check marks, which is amazing.
[1285.68 --> 1293.16]  And back to sort of the inspiration for this, Twitter Blue.
[1293.72 --> 1300.60]  According to the most recent available numbers, only about 0.02% of active Twitter users have a paid subscription of any kind.
[1301.50 --> 1303.42]  I would have guessed it would have been somewhat similar.
[1303.56 --> 1311.16]  Honestly, if you look at conversion rates for users to external things, like say Patreon, Floatplane, Nebula, whatever,
[1312.52 --> 1314.78]  I think it's actually usually a little higher than that.
[1314.78 --> 1317.68]  Yeah, that's because there's no real value.
[1317.68 --> 1318.32]  It definitely is for us.
[1318.58 --> 1319.58]  It's blue pixels.
[1319.86 --> 1324.16]  But yeah, considering how much you get, that's probably about where I would have slapped it.
[1324.96 --> 1330.44]  I mean, Floatplane is actually, we sell it pretty hard these days because it's a pretty darn good value these days.
[1330.72 --> 1330.96]  Yep.
[1332.28 --> 1335.46]  But I'm saying you get a lot if you subscribe to some creators.
[1335.66 --> 1338.32]  Well, I guess it's up to what the creator is offering.
[1338.48 --> 1343.88]  But a lot of times I see you get a decent amount of value if you subscribe to someone's Floatplane or Patreon or whatever else.
[1343.88 --> 1347.96]  Considering what you're getting for the Twitter blue checkmark.
[1347.96 --> 1355.42]  How quickly could the Floatplane team make like whale checkmarks?
[1355.60 --> 1357.78]  Because people on Floatplane are asking for them.
[1358.00 --> 1358.76]  Verified blue eyes.
[1358.78 --> 1361.28]  I've got offers for like 15 bucks here.
[1361.98 --> 1363.28]  You're already paying.
[1364.60 --> 1368.32]  If they want to pay more, Luke, can we get a tier that has a checkmark?
[1368.42 --> 1371.16]  You can subscribe to the Supporter Plus tier.
[1371.48 --> 1372.60]  Then you get 4K.
[1372.60 --> 1374.36]  No, we need Supporter Plus Plus.
[1374.86 --> 1375.40]  Supporter Plus Plus.
[1375.40 --> 1380.48]  We have a product the creator warehouse team is working on that has a size that is extra medium.
[1382.72 --> 1386.12]  There's something in between medium and large and we didn't know what to call it.
[1386.74 --> 1388.84]  We might fix that before we actually launch.
[1388.84 --> 1390.40]  Why do you guys want this?
[1390.64 --> 1391.82]  Oh my goodness.
[1391.82 --> 1400.10]  We'll check in if you guys still want it in like a while when we have bandwidth to work on something like that.
[1400.10 --> 1401.26]  When the memes are over.
[1401.36 --> 1404.80]  Yeah, when the meme is dead, I'll check in if you guys still want it and then we'll see you then.
[1405.02 --> 1407.06]  Yeah, we'll call it the take my money tier.
[1408.28 --> 1409.30]  Yeah, yeah.
[1409.44 --> 1409.82]  I mean that's...
[1410.34 --> 1411.38]  It'll have to be whale tier.
[1411.54 --> 1412.48]  It'll have to be whale tier.
[1412.96 --> 1416.92]  We'll come up with some other stuff that we can bundle in or something like that.
[1416.92 --> 1419.62]  I mean we do care about providing actual value.
[1420.06 --> 1422.72]  Like even the whale tickets at LTX.
[1423.14 --> 1424.86]  I mean, yeah, it's 10 grand.
[1425.22 --> 1427.64]  But it includes like a $5,000 computer.
[1427.82 --> 1428.78]  Don't you get a hotel room?
[1428.88 --> 1429.10]  Yeah.
[1429.32 --> 1429.56]  Yeah.
[1429.76 --> 1429.94]  Yeah.
[1430.26 --> 1431.38]  There's value in there.
[1431.50 --> 1432.80]  We would need to...
[1432.80 --> 1434.62]  Yeah, they would have to have value.
[1434.86 --> 1435.92]  Yeah, we're just...
[1436.70 --> 1438.58]  I'm totally down with their being...
[1438.58 --> 1441.20]  I mean this is up to you guys technically.
[1441.38 --> 1445.06]  But I'm totally down for there being like more expensive tiers that are offered.
[1445.06 --> 1446.26]  Yeah, the problem is I don't...
[1446.26 --> 1447.00]  It should like make sense.
[1447.02 --> 1447.78]  I don't want waste.
[1448.00 --> 1451.04]  Like people are suggesting like free merch every month tier.
[1451.50 --> 1453.86]  And my problem with that is what if it's something you don't want?
[1454.04 --> 1455.54]  Yeah, we don't want you to throw stuff away.
[1455.64 --> 1457.78]  I don't want to ship waste around the world, right?
[1457.80 --> 1459.22]  Like it doesn't do anybody any good.
[1459.28 --> 1460.92]  I'd rather you guys just...
[1460.92 --> 1464.52]  In general, I usually would say you and I, but I think in general at the company,
[1464.66 --> 1467.22]  we are not into the idea of fast fashion.
[1467.96 --> 1469.22]  We're building things to last.
[1469.30 --> 1472.44]  You should be able to keep said thing for a while if you have it.
[1472.44 --> 1475.10]  So we don't want to just create garbage.
[1475.40 --> 1476.94]  It doesn't seem good.
[1477.62 --> 1480.94]  I don't think there's an argument for just genuinely creating garbage.
[1481.74 --> 1483.94]  Yeah, I just am not that into that.
[1484.26 --> 1486.56]  I mean the main value is the exclusive content.
[1486.72 --> 1488.78]  We've got extras from the XQC build.
[1489.66 --> 1490.64]  We've got...
[1490.64 --> 1491.94]  Oh, these are really fun.
[1492.02 --> 1496.08]  We've done a couple of mini moving vlogs for the move over to the lab.
[1496.66 --> 1499.02]  The team is doing such an amazing job.
[1499.02 --> 1502.18]  We're doing, I think, at least two exclusives per week.
[1502.38 --> 1506.14]  So we've got Linus reacts to Dennis and Vance switching roles.
[1506.50 --> 1509.90]  There's an update that is going to be going into beta,
[1510.40 --> 1512.68]  which is something we haven't really done before,
[1512.78 --> 1515.44]  but users will be able to opt into beta to be able to use it.
[1515.96 --> 1518.88]  It's not out yet, but coming relatively soon.
[1519.04 --> 1522.02]  That is going to make it so that when you click on...
[1522.02 --> 1523.88]  If you go back to Flowplane really quick,
[1524.66 --> 1528.02]  if you clicked on that right there,
[1528.18 --> 1529.70]  it would expand downwards,
[1530.02 --> 1531.78]  and you would be able to see a bunch of subchannels.
[1531.96 --> 1534.86]  So like MAC address and TechCookie and ShortCircuit.
[1535.10 --> 1540.68]  So you'd be able to effectively filter to the channel as if it was on YouTube,
[1540.68 --> 1545.90]  but then there can also be other things like Flowplane exclusive or whatever else.
[1545.90 --> 1548.24]  So that's coming.
[1548.54 --> 1550.66]  It's a little bit easier because people have brought up that...
[1550.66 --> 1553.50]  I mean, you can just type in the search like Flowplane exclusive,
[1554.00 --> 1556.30]  but people don't like typing, I guess.
[1556.44 --> 1558.44]  So we will bring a new solution.
[1560.68 --> 1561.28]  But yeah.
[1561.46 --> 1563.88]  Oh, also, while we're talking about those types of things,
[1564.32 --> 1564.98]  merch messages.
[1566.22 --> 1569.10]  People have commented many a time, including I,
[1569.18 --> 1572.62]  that you can't do merch messages if you use ShopPay.
[1572.62 --> 1575.24]  So if you use Shopify fairly actively,
[1575.42 --> 1577.62]  it skips past where merch messages is,
[1578.28 --> 1579.68]  which is pretty annoying for people.
[1580.38 --> 1581.82]  You should explain what merch messages are.
[1581.90 --> 1582.74]  For those of you who are new,
[1582.84 --> 1584.36]  merch messages are down here.
[1584.48 --> 1587.88]  Instead of Twitch bits or YouTube super chats or whatever,
[1588.38 --> 1590.32]  where you just throw money into the ether,
[1590.54 --> 1592.20]  and then maybe we acknowledge your message,
[1592.26 --> 1592.98]  maybe we don't.
[1593.54 --> 1597.82]  Merch messages are a way that you can send in a message to the show like this.
[1598.10 --> 1600.06]  Hey, how'd you decide on Laszlo Supernova?
[1600.06 --> 1604.20]  I think Edsel was a fan and got in touch,
[1604.34 --> 1606.96]  and we had a relationship with Monster Cat,
[1607.72 --> 1612.92]  and basically Laszlo agreed to do a slightly customized version
[1612.92 --> 1616.06]  of the intro song for us that exactly matched our animation.
[1616.86 --> 1618.16]  And it's just, I don't know,
[1618.32 --> 1621.60]  it was so good and it was so iconic that we just kind of kept it forever.
[1622.28 --> 1624.52]  I mean, I can still jam out to it,
[1624.52 --> 1625.64]  and I've heard it so many times.
[1625.64 --> 1627.66]  We have stopped using the intro,
[1627.86 --> 1630.32]  as Dan noted in the response there in every video,
[1630.42 --> 1631.84]  but we do still use it sometimes.
[1632.40 --> 1636.34]  The issue is just that if you're throwing away like seven seconds of retention
[1636.34 --> 1638.26]  right at the beginning of the video, there's...
[1638.26 --> 1639.90]  Of highly valuable retention too.
[1640.10 --> 1642.78]  Yeah, it's just...
[1642.78 --> 1644.26]  The branding is great,
[1644.38 --> 1649.10]  but the effect on viewership of not just that video,
[1649.18 --> 1651.78]  but your entire library is not positive.
[1651.78 --> 1654.78]  So it's something that we've started to shy away from.
[1656.00 --> 1657.30]  Anyway, what was I talking about?
[1657.48 --> 1658.40]  Merge messages, what they are.
[1658.48 --> 1660.06]  Right, merge messages, what they are,
[1660.10 --> 1661.46]  is a way to send in a message to the show,
[1661.54 --> 1663.48]  and if we don't get to it for whatever reason,
[1663.86 --> 1666.24]  or whatever,
[1667.06 --> 1668.70]  at least you get your order in the mail.
[1668.82 --> 1670.78]  So you get a hoodie or a...
[1672.10 --> 1674.86]  Oh, do you have like a right to repair pin plan?
[1674.96 --> 1675.90]  That's a really good idea.
[1676.00 --> 1677.54]  Hey, Dan, do you mind firing that over to Sarah?
[1678.12 --> 1678.46]  Righto.
[1678.58 --> 1679.86]  And then maybe, yeah,
[1679.94 --> 1680.98]  maybe she could do up something like that.
[1680.98 --> 1683.62]  Basically, instead of the only thing that you get
[1683.62 --> 1687.76]  being a chance for your streamer person
[1687.76 --> 1689.14]  that you're watching to respond...
[1689.14 --> 1690.66]  Yeah, and to enrich Google or Amazon.
[1691.02 --> 1693.34]  Now you definitely get something,
[1693.64 --> 1695.48]  and there's a free added bonus
[1695.48 --> 1697.20]  that genuinely costs nothing
[1697.20 --> 1698.40]  that we might respond.
[1698.76 --> 1699.86]  Yeah, so it's cool.
[1700.40 --> 1701.92]  And, oh, we launched a new product today.
[1702.32 --> 1702.92]  Man, we're getting...
[1702.92 --> 1704.22]  Okay, we're getting all this out of the way here.
[1704.68 --> 1705.28]  Oh, wait, okay.
[1705.50 --> 1706.66]  But the clarification there
[1706.66 --> 1709.14]  is where it happens has changed.
[1709.14 --> 1710.80]  It's in, I believe, the cart now.
[1711.30 --> 1711.42]  Right.
[1711.42 --> 1712.98]  So everyone can see it all the time.
[1713.04 --> 1714.02]  Doesn't matter if you're using ShopPay.
[1714.08 --> 1715.76]  Doesn't matter if you're wanting to use Apple Pay
[1715.76 --> 1716.76]  that came up last time, whatever.
[1716.98 --> 1718.30]  You can all see it.
[1718.42 --> 1718.84]  So it works.
[1718.96 --> 1719.34]  It works.
[1719.82 --> 1720.22]  Awesome.
[1720.68 --> 1721.46]  Love it.
[1721.46 --> 1723.70]  And we launched a new desk pad.
[1724.08 --> 1725.62]  The WAN desk pad.
[1725.88 --> 1726.24]  Whoa.
[1726.64 --> 1727.64]  It's a desk pad,
[1727.78 --> 1729.54]  but with a WAN logo
[1729.54 --> 1730.76]  and an orange accent
[1730.76 --> 1733.84]  and very LTT WAN branded
[1733.84 --> 1734.82]  and all that good stuff.
[1734.90 --> 1735.80]  Open the desk configurator.
[1735.80 --> 1737.94]  I opened the desk configurator.
[1738.00 --> 1738.26]  Yeah.
[1738.50 --> 1740.82]  Of course I'm going to open the desk configurator.
[1741.00 --> 1742.88]  This allows you to set your desk width,
[1743.04 --> 1743.94]  your desk depth.
[1744.34 --> 1745.80]  You can set a style.
[1745.80 --> 1749.68]  You can see what different sizes of desk pad will look like.
[1749.68 --> 1750.88]  You can move them around and go,
[1750.96 --> 1752.12]  you know, I'd really like my desk pad
[1752.12 --> 1753.30]  to set something like this.
[1753.48 --> 1756.32]  You can add a monitor.
[1757.62 --> 1758.02]  Wait.
[1758.18 --> 1759.58]  Oh, I thought you could add a monitor.
[1759.90 --> 1761.52]  Well, there's a keyboard anyway.
[1761.98 --> 1763.74]  So you can kind of play around with it
[1763.74 --> 1765.84]  and figure out what size makes sense for you.
[1766.12 --> 1767.90]  Oh, you got to set a monitor count.
[1768.98 --> 1770.00]  Oh, look at that.
[1770.32 --> 1770.58]  Two.
[1771.46 --> 1771.74]  Boop.
[1772.08 --> 1773.02]  You can kind of move them around.
[1773.08 --> 1773.38]  Look at that.
[1773.44 --> 1774.04]  How fun is that?
[1774.10 --> 1774.82]  Everything's to scale.
[1774.82 --> 1776.66]  You can check enable rotation
[1776.66 --> 1779.02]  and turn them if you have them set in angles.
[1779.02 --> 1779.42]  That is.
[1779.72 --> 1781.98]  You can really see how your desk is going to look.
[1782.08 --> 1782.24]  Whoops.
[1782.32 --> 1783.50]  I mean, that's rotating the...
[1783.50 --> 1784.80]  Yeah, well, there's your problem.
[1785.16 --> 1786.22]  There's your problem right there.
[1786.80 --> 1787.04]  Yeah.
[1787.04 --> 1787.28]  Yeah.
[1788.12 --> 1789.68]  That was a lot of work,
[1789.80 --> 1790.62]  but it's really cool.
[1791.10 --> 1791.98]  So that's good.
[1794.74 --> 1795.38]  All right.
[1795.48 --> 1796.40]  So, Luke.
[1796.76 --> 1797.14]  Yes.
[1797.42 --> 1800.04]  Are you signing up for Facebook Plus?
[1800.04 --> 1800.06]  No.
[1800.20 --> 1801.06]  Or Facebook Premium?
[1801.10 --> 1801.94]  What are they even calling it?
[1802.36 --> 1802.80]  Metaverified.
[1802.88 --> 1804.40]  Are you signing up for Metaverified?
[1804.40 --> 1806.10]  Is it the new meta?
[1806.60 --> 1807.56]  Is it the new meta?
[1808.62 --> 1809.74]  No, definitely not.
[1809.86 --> 1811.24]  And I can't believe it's 12 bucks a month.
[1811.34 --> 1812.06]  That's actually insane.
[1812.76 --> 1813.80]  Like, I...
[1813.80 --> 1815.14]  Again.
[1815.14 --> 1816.18]  Well, I guess, again,
[1816.24 --> 1819.68]  it really feels like they're very specifically targeting...
[1819.68 --> 1821.70]  Dan, or should I call you Moiré?
[1822.20 --> 1822.86]  Yeah, that...
[1822.86 --> 1823.90]  That sweater.
[1823.90 --> 1824.62]  Sweater, though.
[1825.08 --> 1825.98]  My goodness.
[1826.76 --> 1827.20]  Okay.
[1827.40 --> 1828.38]  Not camera friendly.
[1828.92 --> 1829.42]  See you later.
[1832.38 --> 1833.02]  Oh, my.
[1833.02 --> 1835.04]  You don't have to take off your sweater.
[1835.14 --> 1835.58]  It's cold in here.
[1835.58 --> 1835.70]  Sorry.
[1836.60 --> 1838.46]  Are you signing up for Metaverified?
[1838.92 --> 1839.26]  No.
[1840.12 --> 1840.50]  All right.
[1840.56 --> 1841.00]  Thanks, Dan.
[1842.84 --> 1843.76]  It really...
[1843.76 --> 1844.94]  Especially with the price,
[1845.00 --> 1847.18]  it feels like it's targeted towards customers
[1847.18 --> 1849.40]  or people who want to use Facebook
[1849.40 --> 1850.52]  in a professional manner.
[1850.62 --> 1851.34]  Yeah, that's fair.
[1851.68 --> 1851.86]  Yeah.
[1852.54 --> 1853.16]  All right.
[1853.16 --> 1853.20]  All right.
[1854.14 --> 1856.50]  Let's talk about a little topic
[1856.50 --> 1857.80]  that I call...
[1857.80 --> 1859.96]  I hate building PCs for people.
[1860.32 --> 1860.70]  Yeah.
[1861.46 --> 1862.02]  Luke...
[1862.02 --> 1863.20]  I do, too.
[1863.84 --> 1865.56]  It really does feel like
[1865.56 --> 1867.34]  a no-good-deed-goes-unpunished
[1867.34 --> 1868.78]  kind of situation, doesn't it?
[1869.18 --> 1869.98]  It does.
[1870.10 --> 1872.76]  I like building PCs for specific people,
[1872.94 --> 1874.10]  and at this point,
[1874.18 --> 1876.20]  I pretty much only build PCs for people
[1876.20 --> 1878.30]  that I have built PCs for in the past,
[1878.38 --> 1880.76]  so I know how they will deal with it.
[1881.08 --> 1881.38]  Okay.
[1881.64 --> 1882.98]  So here's the situation.
[1883.70 --> 1886.50]  I built a PC for someone back in...
[1888.18 --> 1889.50]  Wait, this can't be right.
[1889.54 --> 1891.52]  I think I know who this is.
[1891.58 --> 1891.90]  Okay.
[1892.02 --> 1892.78]  Well, whatever.
[1892.94 --> 1893.90]  It was a while ago.
[1893.98 --> 1894.96]  It was a couple months ago
[1894.96 --> 1895.98]  or something like that.
[1896.30 --> 1896.56]  Okay.
[1896.62 --> 1897.96]  I don't think you know who it is.
[1898.16 --> 1898.44]  Okay.
[1898.72 --> 1899.68]  I don't think you know who it is.
[1899.72 --> 1901.52]  I'm going to be anonymizing it fairly well.
[1901.52 --> 1902.24]  Can I see the name?
[1902.90 --> 1904.46]  I mean, sort of.
[1905.58 --> 1907.34]  I really don't think it's who you think it is.
[1907.44 --> 1908.38]  I have no clue who that is.
[1908.42 --> 1909.22]  That is not who I thought.
[1909.26 --> 1909.66]  That's fine.
[1909.66 --> 1911.42]  It needs to be completely anonymized.
[1911.42 --> 1915.08]  But in February, early February,
[1915.34 --> 1916.26]  I get a message,
[1916.36 --> 1919.90]  I'm just wondering how to get my monitor to 144 hertz
[1919.90 --> 1921.56]  because apparently it's 60 right now.
[1922.06 --> 1922.72]  I kind of go,
[1923.12 --> 1924.16]  all right.
[1924.16 --> 1927.24]  It was definitely at 144 when I gave it to you,
[1927.38 --> 1930.44]  which is all I care about.
[1930.88 --> 1934.66]  This is one of those situations where the PC wasn't free,
[1935.06 --> 1938.64]  but it was like very not retail,
[1938.94 --> 1940.22]  if you know what I mean.
[1940.32 --> 1943.68]  Like there was some wheeling and dealing
[1943.68 --> 1946.28]  that happened to make sure that this person,
[1946.40 --> 1947.90]  who was, you know, a family friend,
[1948.32 --> 1951.88]  definitely got like something a lot better
[1951.88 --> 1953.50]  than they would have walked out of Best Buy with.
[1953.50 --> 1953.78]  Sure.
[1954.20 --> 1956.04]  So as far as I'm concerned,
[1956.50 --> 1958.84]  I have done my good deed already.
[1959.16 --> 1959.40]  Business over.
[1959.64 --> 1959.76]  Yeah.
[1960.20 --> 1962.66]  Our transaction is now complete.
[1964.06 --> 1965.08]  So I kind of go,
[1965.28 --> 1966.96]  are you using HDMI or DisplayPort?
[1967.10 --> 1968.94]  HDMI may be stuck at a lower refresh rate.
[1969.24 --> 1970.16]  Just basic troubleshooting.
[1970.44 --> 1970.58]  Yep.
[1971.08 --> 1972.12]  I don't know what that means.
[1972.24 --> 1972.54]  Sorry.
[1972.70 --> 1973.52]  How can I check?
[1974.50 --> 1975.36]  And I kind of go,
[1976.00 --> 1977.58]  you're going to have to look up how to check.
[1977.74 --> 1978.20]  Use Google.
[1978.40 --> 1978.72]  Okay.
[1979.16 --> 1980.04]  All right.
[1980.04 --> 1982.72]  Two weeks later,
[1983.32 --> 1986.22]  I've been having problems connecting my headset mic.
[1986.68 --> 1988.24]  When I checked, it's not registering.
[1988.42 --> 1989.76]  It doesn't say the model of headset.
[1989.90 --> 1990.58]  Here, I'll show it to you.
[1990.64 --> 1991.08]  Screenshot.
[1991.22 --> 1992.50]  I'm like, I don't know.
[1992.86 --> 1993.92]  If I was in front of it,
[1993.98 --> 1995.06]  I might be able to figure it out,
[1995.18 --> 1997.30]  but you might just have to find some troubleshooting guides.
[1997.30 --> 2011.46]  I get no fewer than 12 messages over the next three days that go as far as,
[2012.58 --> 2014.12]  I'm pretty, okay.
[2014.60 --> 2017.04]  I really think this is urgent.
[2017.86 --> 2019.04]  Please reply to this quickly.
[2019.12 --> 2020.40]  I can't do anything on my PC.
[2020.40 --> 2023.48]  And I'm just, I'm sitting here going,
[2024.16 --> 2032.60]  what's my incentive to do a favor for anyone at that point?
[2033.54 --> 2035.30]  You know, like I don't.
[2035.90 --> 2036.94]  I want to try.
[2037.50 --> 2041.58]  I found a website called LetMeGPTThatForYou.
[2042.54 --> 2043.02]  Okay.
[2043.12 --> 2043.96]  We're going to Luke's screen.
[2044.10 --> 2044.98]  We're going to Luke's screen.
[2045.08 --> 2045.48]  Here we go.
[2045.54 --> 2045.92]  Here we go.
[2045.94 --> 2046.58]  Let's see if it works.
[2047.40 --> 2047.84]  Okay.
[2047.84 --> 2053.10]  I mean, this is one of those troubleshooting things that is so broad that.
[2053.54 --> 2054.90]  I'm just wondering what it's going to say.
[2054.98 --> 2055.32]  Sure.
[2063.90 --> 2064.34]  Yeah.
[2064.48 --> 2064.82]  All right.
[2064.90 --> 2066.96]  I mean, this is good troubleshooting so far.
[2068.68 --> 2071.02]  Is this Bing or is this ChatGPT?
[2071.32 --> 2073.32]  I'm assuming this is ChatGPT.
[2073.54 --> 2073.94]  Okay.
[2074.20 --> 2075.20]  I don't actually know.
[2075.50 --> 2077.28]  I've never actually used this website before.
[2077.28 --> 2080.62]  I was just thinking like there's got to, it has to exist.
[2080.88 --> 2081.80]  And then, yeah, it did.
[2082.02 --> 2083.10]  Performing Google server.
[2083.18 --> 2084.48]  It must be, wait.
[2085.50 --> 2085.80]  What?
[2088.58 --> 2089.02]  Okay.
[2089.56 --> 2090.94]  It's scrolling down.
[2091.10 --> 2091.64]  What is this?
[2091.70 --> 2093.38]  What is this bot doing?
[2094.92 --> 2097.92]  It clicks the first hit for you?
[2097.92 --> 2101.52]  I don't know, man.
[2101.52 --> 2101.62]  I don't know, man.
[2101.62 --> 2103.26]  This is maximum tier snark.
[2103.46 --> 2104.94]  I don't know, man.
[2107.10 --> 2108.50]  Wait, it just moves it there?
[2108.56 --> 2109.42]  I have to click on it?
[2109.44 --> 2110.52]  You have to click it.
[2110.74 --> 2111.06]  Amazing.
[2111.34 --> 2111.54]  Okay.
[2111.70 --> 2112.34]  That makes sense.
[2112.42 --> 2116.24]  That would probably violate Google's T's and C's if it actually clicked a link for you.
[2116.24 --> 2116.38]  Yeah.
[2117.10 --> 2117.46]  Hilarious.
[2117.60 --> 2117.92]  All right.
[2118.16 --> 2118.50]  Interesting.
[2118.50 --> 2124.94]  Anyway, I feel like this is one of those am I the a**hole things, right?
[2125.26 --> 2130.06]  For basically just saying, so my response, my response to this wall of text is, sorry,
[2130.14 --> 2131.78]  I really can't dig into issues like this.
[2131.82 --> 2134.90]  If there's a problem, you'll have to shut it down for now and take it to a computer shop.
[2135.22 --> 2136.84]  Or you can try and fix it yourself.
[2136.84 --> 2140.88]  I didn't have anyone to help me troubleshoot and things usually worked out okay.
[2141.46 --> 2142.38]  Tongue, smiley face.
[2143.94 --> 2145.64]  A little bit of sass on the end.
[2146.42 --> 2148.58]  A little bit of unnecessary sass on the end.
[2148.84 --> 2150.14]  But here's the thing.
[2150.22 --> 2150.62]  I mean, okay.
[2151.42 --> 2153.02]  Have you read these articles?
[2153.36 --> 2158.12]  And I've heard anecdotally from a couple of people I've talked to this about recently.
[2158.24 --> 2161.42]  One who's a teacher and one who worked in an office.
[2161.42 --> 2166.14]  And I've read articles about this too, that apparently the younger generation, in spite
[2166.14 --> 2172.14]  of growing up with computers, is entering the workplace with fewer functional computing
[2172.14 --> 2172.66]  skills.
[2172.78 --> 2176.22]  They grew up with less computer problems because things worked more often.
[2176.92 --> 2178.44]  So that's the thing, right?
[2179.34 --> 2180.64]  Is this just tough love?
[2181.38 --> 2183.14]  That's what I thought I was doing.
[2183.28 --> 2185.94]  Like, look, no, if you want to solve this, if you want to play video games.
[2186.06 --> 2188.86]  I didn't want to pry, but is this a younger person?
[2188.88 --> 2190.08]  This is a younger person, yes.
[2190.08 --> 2191.52]  So I got that vibe.
[2191.86 --> 2192.02]  Yeah.
[2192.02 --> 2196.76]  And in that case, I mean, it seems more fair.
[2197.00 --> 2197.46]  I don't know.
[2197.88 --> 2200.60]  Because, I mean, realistically, what do young people even do?
[2202.00 --> 2206.32]  Honestly, you're done your obligations for the day by like three o'clock.
[2206.54 --> 2207.60]  Is that when school ends?
[2207.64 --> 2208.14]  I don't even remember.
[2208.26 --> 2208.44]  Yeah.
[2209.14 --> 2210.46]  So figure it out.
[2210.96 --> 2215.18]  Like, I'm not trying to be a jerk about it or anything, but that was how I learned.
[2215.18 --> 2220.14]  The only reason that I'm doing this today, that I don't any of this stuff, is because
[2220.14 --> 2225.14]  I was highly motivated to fix my computer because I wanted to play video games.
[2227.34 --> 2228.02]  Me too.
[2228.24 --> 2229.22]  And it's amazing, right?
[2229.32 --> 2232.44]  Kids can figure out just about anything.
[2232.90 --> 2234.22]  Just about anything.
[2234.22 --> 2237.78]  I'm surprised that first one, they didn't just Google it.
[2238.68 --> 2242.70]  Because like my monitor is not running at the right refresh rate, whatever, is like super
[2242.70 --> 2243.04]  Google.
[2243.08 --> 2243.80]  What is HDMI?
[2244.48 --> 2245.14]  Super Google.
[2245.14 --> 2250.40]  And I have to confess that the second problem with the headset is probably a more challenging
[2250.40 --> 2250.84]  problem.
[2251.08 --> 2251.32]  Less Google.
[2251.56 --> 2251.80]  Yeah.
[2251.80 --> 2256.90]  But I was already kind of in the wrong frame of mind from being asked what HDMI is.
[2257.24 --> 2260.22]  So maybe there was a little bit of snark.
[2260.98 --> 2262.72]  But it's also true, right?
[2262.84 --> 2270.46]  Like the reality is that I am highly disincentivized to build computers for people if they're going
[2270.46 --> 2275.00]  to bother me about how they work when it's not an actual problem with the computer.
[2275.40 --> 2277.34]  I mean, maybe we need to just pull the audience here.
[2277.40 --> 2278.34]  I don't know how to set up polls.
[2278.48 --> 2278.84]  I forget.
[2278.84 --> 2283.76]  But I've got some people that I've been like building computers for since like high school
[2283.76 --> 2287.40]  that I still build computers for them whenever they need new ones.
[2288.18 --> 2291.84]  They never bother me about pretty much anything.
[2292.30 --> 2292.66]  Yeah.
[2292.66 --> 2294.94]  They just like they've never actually built one on their own.
[2295.16 --> 2298.42]  And every once in a while, it'll be like, you know, like three or four years or maybe
[2298.42 --> 2299.12]  a little bit more.
[2299.40 --> 2302.64]  But they'll be like, hey, like, are you still down?
[2303.16 --> 2304.12]  I'm like, yeah, sure.
[2304.28 --> 2304.50]  Whatever.
[2304.98 --> 2307.96]  They haven't bugged me since then about that, at least.
[2307.96 --> 2309.24]  So it's like, yeah, why not?
[2309.56 --> 2310.48]  It doesn't really matter to me.
[2310.48 --> 2314.30]  Like if we're still going to have the understanding that like you got to maintain it over the next
[2314.30 --> 2314.62]  while.
[2314.92 --> 2316.34]  But yeah, I'll put it together for you.
[2316.48 --> 2317.02]  I don't mind that.
[2317.36 --> 2317.62]  Yeah.
[2317.82 --> 2322.20]  Chat is pretty universally aligned on this.
[2322.34 --> 2322.90]  I do think.
[2323.04 --> 2324.52]  Don't build computers for family.
[2324.64 --> 2325.94]  Don't build computers for friends.
[2325.94 --> 2329.38]  Because every time you do it, you turn into tech support for it forever.
[2329.38 --> 2330.32]  I do think.
[2330.62 --> 2333.98]  And there used to be a thread on the forum and this would annoy the heck out of me, which
[2333.98 --> 2334.26]  was.
[2334.38 --> 2334.48]  Yeah.
[2334.84 --> 2338.28]  I don't know exactly what it was called, but it was something about like.
[2340.78 --> 2341.44]  What was it called?
[2341.50 --> 2342.44]  Tales from tech support.
[2343.36 --> 2344.30]  I've heard that before.
[2344.38 --> 2344.52]  Yeah.
[2344.62 --> 2345.74]  I think that's what it was.
[2345.84 --> 2346.02]  Yeah.
[2346.16 --> 2346.86]  I don't remember.
[2347.72 --> 2349.34]  I know there was a subreddit for it.
[2349.42 --> 2350.32]  There was a thread on the form.
[2350.38 --> 2350.82]  All this kind of stuff.
[2350.82 --> 2355.34]  That kind of stuff used to bother me because a lot of the stories that would end up in
[2355.34 --> 2355.56]  there.
[2355.68 --> 2356.74]  Just mocking people.
[2356.96 --> 2358.70]  Were actually just people being like.
[2359.22 --> 2360.26]  Just gatekeeper-y.
[2360.26 --> 2360.86]  Like losers.
[2361.18 --> 2361.38]  Yeah.
[2361.64 --> 2362.20]  Like if.
[2363.88 --> 2364.70]  Like, yeah, okay.
[2364.74 --> 2366.00]  Don't build computers for family.
[2366.58 --> 2368.58]  Except it kind of depends.
[2369.78 --> 2370.08]  Yeah.
[2370.24 --> 2371.42]  Like maybe you should.
[2371.90 --> 2372.22]  Yeah.
[2372.66 --> 2377.50]  I did one for my parents back in the day and they haven't needed an upgrade since then.
[2377.94 --> 2378.76]  You know what's really fun?
[2378.86 --> 2380.78]  There's an NCIX tech tips episode.
[2381.40 --> 2382.32]  Where I build.
[2382.78 --> 2387.76]  Where I fix a pin on like a Phenom X3 or something like that.
[2387.76 --> 2388.82]  Athlon X3.
[2389.88 --> 2390.70]  Triple core.
[2391.34 --> 2392.38]  And that CPU.
[2392.98 --> 2393.38]  Oh no.
[2393.52 --> 2393.64]  No.
[2393.74 --> 2394.44]  Phenom 720.
[2394.62 --> 2394.90]  I don't know.
[2394.94 --> 2395.12]  Whatever.
[2395.24 --> 2398.40]  That CPU is in my parents' computer to this day.
[2398.56 --> 2399.76]  Because it was broken.
[2400.14 --> 2402.74]  And I was like, can I just have this?
[2403.04 --> 2405.10]  And they were like, it's a broken CPU.
[2405.50 --> 2405.92]  Get out of here.
[2406.24 --> 2406.98]  I'm like, okay, cool.
[2407.48 --> 2409.18]  So that still works.
[2409.18 --> 2410.88]  They don't bother me about it though.
[2411.02 --> 2412.22]  I built one for my sister.
[2413.18 --> 2415.08]  She also hasn't bothered me about it.
[2415.72 --> 2417.52]  Thankfully, her hubby is pretty technical though.
[2417.56 --> 2419.52]  So she wouldn't really need to.
[2419.64 --> 2422.58]  I will say I have some privilege here because my family's quite technical.
[2422.98 --> 2423.22]  Yeah.
[2423.22 --> 2424.56]  My brother are both very technical.
[2424.92 --> 2425.14]  Yeah.
[2425.22 --> 2429.90]  But like if my mom has computer problems, I'm going to help my mom with her computer problems.
[2430.02 --> 2430.16]  Yeah.
[2430.22 --> 2430.90]  Same with my aunt.
[2431.22 --> 2431.98]  Like there's...
[2431.98 --> 2435.08]  And I'll like write down on the, all the steps on the piece of paper.
[2435.08 --> 2438.12]  I'll record a little video for her of like how to do it and stuff.
[2438.12 --> 2442.06]  Like if this is a family member that you only ever have contact with when they have computer problems.
[2442.44 --> 2443.42]  That's the worst.
[2443.52 --> 2444.44]  That's one thing.
[2444.56 --> 2446.34]  That's its own kind of realm.
[2446.46 --> 2447.30]  I have one of those.
[2447.40 --> 2452.86]  An extended family member who I literally hear from once every year or two when they want to ask me something about a computer.
[2452.86 --> 2453.02]  Yeah.
[2453.02 --> 2453.78]  See, like that's annoying.
[2453.78 --> 2460.48]  But if this is a family member that you're in like pretty consistent contact with or like raised you or whatever else.
[2460.64 --> 2461.88]  Or tries to help themselves.
[2462.18 --> 2462.30]  Yeah.
[2462.42 --> 2469.28]  That's a huge part of it is if I don't have to explain the same thing over and over and over again, I have a ton more patience for it.
[2469.28 --> 2473.04]  Or maybe they're super not technical, but they like gave it a shot.
[2474.16 --> 2475.12]  Just couldn't figure it out.
[2475.60 --> 2475.70]  Yeah.
[2475.74 --> 2477.24]  You know, and didn't make it worse, hopefully.
[2477.58 --> 2477.88]  Yeah.
[2478.06 --> 2479.06]  Sometimes a problem.
[2479.74 --> 2483.68]  But like there's, there's things like that where it's like, man, like just get over it.
[2483.78 --> 2489.48]  There's also other ones that I used to find in those threads, which were people literally just complaining about the fact that they had to do a job.
[2490.50 --> 2492.58]  Like they were, that used to drive me nuts too.
[2492.74 --> 2495.66]  They would like be in technical support at a company.
[2496.20 --> 2498.36]  And then they'd be like, these idiots have computer problems.
[2498.36 --> 2499.72]  It's like, yeah, it's why you're here.
[2500.76 --> 2501.46]  You're welcome.
[2501.64 --> 2502.00]  Yeah.
[2502.06 --> 2503.94]  Like what do you want?
[2504.02 --> 2505.60]  Like stop, stop complaining.
[2505.88 --> 2509.42]  They have, they have like things that they would rather not do at their job as well.
[2509.48 --> 2509.86]  I don't know.
[2510.00 --> 2511.60]  Those types of things used to bother me.
[2511.60 --> 2515.08]  Like don't complain about helping people that help you.
[2515.28 --> 2515.72]  Yeah.
[2515.78 --> 2517.74]  Like it should be a cyclical thing.
[2517.80 --> 2525.14]  If these people like raised you and in a not completely terrible way, maybe I'll carry on it with that.
[2525.28 --> 2525.44]  Yeah.
[2525.50 --> 2528.10]  Based on how you turned out, I don't know if you owe them any tech support.
[2528.44 --> 2528.70]  Wow.
[2529.06 --> 2529.42]  Rude.
[2530.20 --> 2531.48]  I think I owe them lots.
[2531.48 --> 2541.36]  But yeah, like if there's, if there's, I don't know, just don't be super salty all the time about doing good things for people.
[2541.36 --> 2548.16]  But if people are just trying to extract value from you and they don't care about you at all, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2548.26 --> 2549.46]  Don't deal with that either.
[2550.00 --> 2550.16]  Yeah.
[2550.30 --> 2552.04]  I think both of them are valid stances.
[2552.04 --> 2554.56]  I'm holding the line.
[2555.08 --> 2556.68]  I'm basically just going, yep.
[2557.02 --> 2559.68]  If I could figure it out, then you can figure it out.
[2559.76 --> 2563.22]  And if you can't figure it out, then I already saved you hundreds of dollars.
[2563.36 --> 2564.18]  You can take it to a shop.
[2564.26 --> 2564.92]  You already did a lot.
[2565.34 --> 2566.76]  So I'm over it.
[2567.00 --> 2567.16]  Yep.
[2567.42 --> 2567.84]  All right.
[2568.06 --> 2568.74]  That's it.
[2571.78 --> 2572.40]  Next up.
[2573.20 --> 2576.22]  Do you really care that much that I rage quit a video game?
[2576.72 --> 2578.16]  That's a headline topic to you.
[2579.96 --> 2580.60]  I don't know.
[2580.66 --> 2580.82]  Sure.
[2581.00 --> 2582.56]  None of these other things interest me.
[2582.56 --> 2589.36]  I would have like tried to submit topics, but I was genuinely like getting concerned partway through the week because I was like, nothing's happening.
[2590.08 --> 2591.72]  Nothing's happening at all.
[2592.76 --> 2594.68]  What are we going to talk about?
[2595.56 --> 2603.56]  There was like, okay, a minor continuation on the like Microsoft, Sony and Activision Blizzard thing.
[2603.56 --> 2606.40]  But like that's been going on for a million years.
[2606.40 --> 2609.50]  And I think people barely care until it gets finalized.
[2609.50 --> 2612.04]  Like, do they actually get to buy ABK or not?
[2612.60 --> 2614.30]  And it hasn't been finalized yet.
[2614.60 --> 2617.98]  How about Canada may force Google and Meta to pay for Canadian news?
[2618.02 --> 2618.72]  Is that interesting?
[2618.72 --> 2620.76]  Because we've already talked about this at least two times.
[2620.94 --> 2623.00]  Well, there was when Australia started doing it.
[2623.06 --> 2624.00]  We've already talked about Canada.
[2624.26 --> 2625.36]  And yeah, okay.
[2627.78 --> 2630.02]  I mean, I think it's worth talking about.
[2630.04 --> 2630.80]  We can go into it.
[2631.24 --> 2632.44]  It's still a maybe though.
[2632.50 --> 2633.42]  And it was a maybe last time.
[2633.42 --> 2634.06]  The screenwriter is right there.
[2634.06 --> 2634.76]  It's not her fault.
[2634.86 --> 2637.50]  Are you going to look right at her and not read this?
[2637.98 --> 2640.10]  She can't make things exist.
[2640.44 --> 2642.72]  You can't like knock on like Nvidia's door and be like, hey.
[2643.26 --> 2644.56]  Do something controversial.
[2644.64 --> 2645.80]  We need things for the way it's show.
[2646.04 --> 2646.98]  Unlaunch a GPU.
[2648.82 --> 2651.64]  I don't think the writing's bad.
[2651.70 --> 2652.48]  It's just nothing happened.
[2652.48 --> 2660.54]  For a period of five weeks, Google will be testing blocking links to news articles from appearing in searches for around a million Canadian users.
[2660.54 --> 2669.30]  The test is a response to Canada's proposed online news act, which would obligate them to pay for links to media content that appears in Google searches.
[2669.88 --> 2672.94]  Google has described the bill as overly broad.
[2672.94 --> 2683.42]  And Meta has stated that they might restrict access to news on their own platforms should the bill pass into law, which is I think what they're trying to do is get people to go to the original sauce for the news.
[2683.42 --> 2686.46]  So mission accomplished, I guess.
[2687.10 --> 2689.44]  Australia passed a similar law back in 2021.
[2689.78 --> 2693.98]  Back then, Google conducted similar tests and Meta restricted links to news articles on its platforms.
[2694.50 --> 2700.82]  Eventually, however, both Meta and Google agreed to licensing deals estimated to be worth at least 200 million Australian dollars annually.
[2701.64 --> 2702.72]  We have a note here.
[2702.88 --> 2706.38]  Australia is home to Rupert Murdoch, possibly the world's largest news magnate.
[2706.82 --> 2712.32]  The Meta and Googles of the world might not feel the same pressure to give in to Canada's demands.
[2712.32 --> 2713.98]  We want more money.
[2714.58 --> 2716.16]  How about some of that internet money?
[2717.42 --> 2718.34]  Stephen Bootman.
[2718.98 --> 2723.32]  Anyway, a spokesperson for the Canadian Heritage Minister described...
[2724.10 --> 2726.50]  Man, imagine that being your job.
[2726.62 --> 2728.70]  I'm in charge of Canadian heritage.
[2729.76 --> 2730.12]  Okay.
[2731.30 --> 2735.60]  So what, HBC and Canada's Goose coats?
[2735.84 --> 2737.22]  I don't know.
[2737.38 --> 2737.74]  Yeah, sure.
[2737.86 --> 2738.14]  Beavers.
[2738.14 --> 2738.44]  Yeah.
[2738.94 --> 2741.62]  Described Google's actions as a threat and said,
[2741.72 --> 2742.98]  Canadians won't be intimidated.
[2743.52 --> 2747.94]  At the end of the day, all we're asking the tech giants to do is compensate journalists when they use their work.
[2748.86 --> 2749.84]  Complicating matters.
[2751.28 --> 2756.50]  It's debatable to what degree Meta in particular can be described as using the work of journalists.
[2756.50 --> 2763.78]  Links to articles and other news content are typically posted to Facebook and Instagram by users and often by the journalists themselves.
[2764.48 --> 2771.62]  Google could be accused in certain instances of replacing the need to click through to articles by extracting snippets that directly answer users' questions.
[2771.62 --> 2776.76]  But it's hard to say how exactly that's going to shake out.
[2777.26 --> 2787.62]  The government states that regulators will determine which organizations will be required to negotiate licensing agreements for news content according to principles such as power imbalance and quasi-monopoly status in a given market.
[2788.32 --> 2795.44]  So the discussion question here is, is it reasonable for large platforms to simply not link to content that they would otherwise have to pay for?
[2795.44 --> 2800.92]  I mean, it's completely up to them.
[2801.46 --> 2801.72]  Yeah.
[2802.16 --> 2806.78]  And then it's completely up to users whether that platform still has any value to them, right?
[2808.50 --> 2809.02]  Yeah.
[2809.02 --> 2817.00]  Yeah, I'm trying to think, like, based on how I interact with my Google News feed, I'm not sure how to feel about this.
[2817.04 --> 2822.26]  Because on the one hand, I simply just do not read any article that's paywalled.
[2822.26 --> 2829.88]  But on the other hand, I still like seeing the headlines just because it's nice to just kind of know what's going on.
[2830.10 --> 2830.52]  Sort of, yeah.
[2830.62 --> 2839.66]  And then if it is particularly pressing, then what I can do is I can just sort of see what people are saying about it and read the comments.
[2840.74 --> 2842.26]  Figure out what at least people...
[2842.88 --> 2843.18]  General sentiment.
[2843.34 --> 2845.16]  Yeah, what general sentiment towards it is.
[2845.16 --> 2859.80]  And so just not having sort of any awareness of it at all unless I start actually going to, like, news media websites, which I don't remember the last time I ever did.
[2859.80 --> 2860.16]  There's actually a decent...
[2860.16 --> 2863.22]  Like, organically just navigated directly to a news site.
[2863.34 --> 2870.92]  This isn't a super Western thing, but there is a decent amount of countries that have their own kind of news access stuff.
[2870.92 --> 2877.74]  I wouldn't be surprised if there was, like, an inside of Canada aggregate for these types of countries.
[2877.74 --> 2879.08]  Canada inside news sites.
[2879.30 --> 2879.48]  Yeah.
[2880.26 --> 2881.14]  The CBC.
[2881.60 --> 2882.22]  No, it's not.
[2883.08 --> 2884.92]  That would just be one of them, but...
[2884.92 --> 2885.84]  Yeah, fair enough.
[2886.06 --> 2886.26]  Yeah.
[2886.50 --> 2887.44]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2887.52 --> 2890.22]  Like, what are you going to do?
[2890.56 --> 2891.62]  Where will you get your news?
[2894.68 --> 2895.12]  Reddit?
[2895.34 --> 2898.50]  I'm usually happier when I disconnect more from the news.
[2898.64 --> 2899.76]  Yeah, that's true.
[2899.76 --> 2899.84]  That's true.
[2902.10 --> 2903.44]  But, yeah, I don't know.
[2903.52 --> 2914.62]  I've also find that I'm usually happier when I use things like Reddit and other various attempts to get you to infinite scroll type applications less.
[2915.20 --> 2918.28]  So I've just been more and more disconnected moving forward.
[2919.18 --> 2919.46]  I don't know.
[2919.52 --> 2920.80]  Reddit usually makes me pretty happy.
[2923.38 --> 2925.96]  That was a really well-timed phone buzz.
[2927.98 --> 2929.42]  I'm not taking it.
[2929.42 --> 2930.04]  No bait.
[2930.72 --> 2931.60]  I'm not biting.
[2932.30 --> 2935.70]  Let's talk about the first time that I have rage quit a game.
[2935.86 --> 2936.06]  Yeah.
[2936.24 --> 2936.62]  Like, ever.
[2936.68 --> 2938.80]  I actually think this should be somewhat interesting.
[2939.50 --> 2947.72]  I recently purchased an Apple TV and an Apple Arcade subscription for one game.
[2947.82 --> 2949.76]  Also, talked about it many times on WAN Show.
[2949.88 --> 2950.00]  Yes.
[2950.00 --> 2951.16]  There was a lot of excitement for this.
[2951.22 --> 2951.42]  Yes.
[2951.74 --> 2953.02]  And it was the follow-up to what?
[2953.02 --> 2955.42]  Well, it's not a follow-up to anything.
[2955.42 --> 2959.84]  But it's a very, like, traditional style RPG.
[2960.64 --> 2961.88]  Like, JRPG.
[2961.88 --> 2968.72]  And the team behind it, which includes Hironobu Sakaguchi, of Final Fantasy VI fame.
[2968.88 --> 2972.68]  Sort of like one of my favorite games of all time.
[2973.04 --> 2974.48]  Also, Nobumetsu.
[2974.62 --> 2976.38]  I can't remember how to pronounce his last name.
[2976.44 --> 2976.74]  I'm sorry.
[2976.74 --> 2979.40]  But the composer for basically, like, every Final Fantasy game ever.
[2980.02 --> 2981.12]  So they're on it.
[2981.22 --> 2984.64]  A bunch of other folks from sort of that era were like, okay.
[2986.02 --> 2989.86]  For both of the two headliners, they're kind of going, this could be our last game.
[2991.46 --> 2993.58]  Let's do it traditional style.
[2993.74 --> 2994.82]  It's called Fantasian.
[2995.32 --> 2997.00]  And it's Apple Arcade exclusive.
[2997.00 --> 3003.60]  I eventually gave up on it ever coming to anything else because I realized, holy crap, Apple funded the whole thing.
[3003.88 --> 3005.32]  This wasn't a licensing agreement.
[3005.58 --> 3008.04]  They actually just funded the game.
[3009.28 --> 3015.56]  It's also, just for user context, on the Apple App Store, it is rated 4.7 out of 5.
[3015.70 --> 3015.90]  Yep.
[3016.00 --> 3017.20]  On RPG site.
[3017.66 --> 3018.28]  I don't know what that is.
[3018.48 --> 3019.60]  It's rated 9 out of 10.
[3019.94 --> 3026.06]  And then Google users have given the game a rating of 94% or 94% of users liked the game.
[3026.06 --> 3028.06]  I guess it's a Rotten Tomatoes style.
[3028.16 --> 3030.76]  And it's absolutely beautiful.
[3031.08 --> 3034.20]  So the environments are actually done in dioramas.
[3034.94 --> 3037.74]  So these are all miniatures.
[3038.24 --> 3038.66]  Oh, wow.
[3038.72 --> 3044.08]  And then the characters and elements of the game that you can interact with, like chests.
[3045.26 --> 3050.32]  Even the fight environments are all done in diorama form.
[3050.66 --> 3052.06]  It is gorgeous.
[3052.26 --> 3052.86]  It's utterly unique.
[3052.86 --> 3054.44]  Like, is this an actual diorama?
[3054.74 --> 3054.92]  Yes.
[3054.92 --> 3056.74]  But then you have digital characters that move around it?
[3056.74 --> 3057.08]  That then they scan.
[3057.28 --> 3058.16]  They scan it.
[3058.26 --> 3060.12]  And then digital characters move around with it.
[3060.28 --> 3060.76]  That's pretty cool.
[3060.82 --> 3060.96]  Yeah.
[3061.06 --> 3062.24]  It's beautiful.
[3062.30 --> 3062.88]  It's a cool idea.
[3064.38 --> 3066.78]  It definitely has some problems.
[3067.14 --> 3072.46]  I wouldn't say that it takes a particularly enlightened approach to its female characters.
[3072.46 --> 3078.48]  So for better or for worse, it's a very traditional JRPG.
[3078.96 --> 3083.66]  But that's, frankly speaking, not what put me off of it.
[3083.88 --> 3087.66]  What put me off of it was the fact that it was mobile first.
[3088.96 --> 3094.72]  Now, you might be wondering, if that was the issue, why did I put over 30 hours into it?
[3094.72 --> 3097.20]  And that's a fair question.
[3098.08 --> 3099.50]  Well, you were pretty dedicated, right?
[3099.56 --> 3104.16]  You bought, you were excited for it for a long time, and you bought the whatever it was.
[3104.16 --> 3105.34]  I bought hardware in order to play it.
[3105.40 --> 3105.50]  Yeah.
[3105.90 --> 3108.72]  But the problem is not anything to do with controls.
[3108.98 --> 3110.50]  It had full support for controller.
[3110.66 --> 3111.40]  Everything was perfect.
[3111.54 --> 3115.48]  And I actually spent the vast majority of my time playing it, or actually all of my time,
[3115.54 --> 3117.82]  because that was where the Apple TV is, in the theater.
[3117.82 --> 3120.96]  So I was playing, like, on a big screen, no problems.
[3123.76 --> 3125.66]  But I reached about the midpoint.
[3125.92 --> 3127.44]  I think it's the midpoint of the game.
[3127.76 --> 3129.32]  I think it's late in part one.
[3129.42 --> 3132.64]  I mean, I don't know, because I am never going to finish the game.
[3132.98 --> 3138.50]  I reached the point where the boss fights started to become hideously unfair.
[3139.92 --> 3144.12]  And the vibe that I'm getting is whether this is because it was designed for mobile
[3144.12 --> 3149.32]  to keep you playing endlessly so that you'll keep your Apple Arcade subscription,
[3149.70 --> 3154.04]  or whether it's because it was designed for an all-you-can-eat platform
[3154.04 --> 3160.26]  instead of to be sold for $59.99 or $69.99 on a platform like Nintendo Switch,
[3160.34 --> 3164.70]  where they'll actually get, like, an enormous amount of revenue
[3164.70 --> 3168.06]  that's really easily attributable to this game,
[3168.58 --> 3173.24]  or whether it's because Apple just doesn't really understand gaming
[3173.24 --> 3177.70]  and didn't invest money in certain critically important aspects
[3177.70 --> 3179.14]  of the development process.
[3179.48 --> 3183.72]  Whatever the reason is, the game basically falls apart
[3183.72 --> 3185.10]  in terms of difficulty curve.
[3185.54 --> 3186.82]  And it's not just difficulty.
[3187.02 --> 3188.88]  I don't mind playing a difficult game.
[3188.96 --> 3191.22]  I don't mind sitting in a boss fight for 45 minutes.
[3191.66 --> 3195.08]  But what finally made me just put down the controller,
[3195.78 --> 3198.26]  turn off the system, and walk out of the room
[3198.26 --> 3204.14]  was this fight with some spirit wolf thing or something like that
[3204.14 --> 3211.14]  that basically, I kid you not, you can be half an hour, 40 minutes into the fight,
[3211.72 --> 3216.72]  and just with a couple of bad RNGs
[3216.72 --> 3221.56]  be at a non-progression bug, essentially.
[3221.56 --> 3225.06]  Because one of its abilities, okay, so it's got a few abilities.
[3225.16 --> 3228.32]  First of all, a problem with the game in general is that your party is three.
[3228.98 --> 3234.68]  Which means that if anyone gets knocked, it is now two turns to be back to health.
[3235.18 --> 3239.22]  Which is a full cycle of your buffs wearing out,
[3239.60 --> 3243.24]  and their debuffs wearing out, where you cannot do anything.
[3243.24 --> 3244.08]  So you're going to have to reset.
[3244.08 --> 3248.04]  Plus, whenever anyone gets knocked, not only do they lose any buffs,
[3248.20 --> 3251.90]  but they also get knocked in terms of their turn position.
[3252.24 --> 3253.48]  So they lose a turn.
[3253.60 --> 3256.18]  You can't just pick them right back up, and then go,
[3256.28 --> 3257.96]  okay, but they get a turn, now they can heal,
[3258.14 --> 3259.98]  and you're back in the fight.
[3260.52 --> 3264.76]  So this particular boss has a one-two,
[3264.98 --> 3266.70]  where it can knock one of your characters,
[3267.08 --> 3268.18]  then take another action.
[3268.90 --> 3271.50]  That other action can be to summon minions.
[3271.50 --> 3275.02]  Those minions then get turns right away,
[3275.10 --> 3276.90]  before you can pick up that knocked character,
[3277.10 --> 3278.68]  where they can also summon minions.
[3278.80 --> 3280.98]  I believe it can summon up to nine total minions.
[3281.60 --> 3284.50]  And then, randomly, that boss,
[3285.10 --> 3286.94]  or not randomly, but every once in a while,
[3287.00 --> 3288.52]  and it does seem to be a little bit RNG,
[3289.18 --> 3291.78]  it can cast a barrier spell on itself
[3291.78 --> 3294.00]  that takes 20 hits to wear down.
[3294.94 --> 3297.32]  Now, what's really interesting about this barrier spell
[3297.32 --> 3298.96]  is that when it casts it,
[3298.96 --> 3301.76]  it casts it on itself and all minions at the same time.
[3301.96 --> 3302.30]  Oh, God.
[3303.14 --> 3303.56]  Now, you have...
[3303.56 --> 3305.56]  Do a lot of your attacks, like, cleave everything?
[3305.62 --> 3307.52]  You have multi-hit attacks.
[3307.58 --> 3308.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3308.10 --> 3310.14]  The most you can do is eight.
[3310.30 --> 3312.92]  But in that fight, one of the characters is locked.
[3312.98 --> 3315.54]  So normally, you can actually cycle your characters during a fight.
[3315.74 --> 3317.20]  There's so many cool game mechanics.
[3317.56 --> 3320.18]  Like, the ability to use your entire RPG party
[3320.18 --> 3322.62]  in one fight is super cool.
[3322.62 --> 3325.78]  And there isn't, like, a turn weight penalty to it or anything like that.
[3325.82 --> 3329.10]  You can just use your entire party in any combination you want in any battle,
[3329.16 --> 3330.78]  which is kind of awesome.
[3330.94 --> 3332.62]  If one of them gets knocked...
[3332.62 --> 3332.92]  No.
[3333.26 --> 3334.14]  You can't swap them until they get brought up.
[3334.14 --> 3335.66]  You have to res them and then swap them.
[3335.70 --> 3336.24]  Got it, yeah, yeah.
[3337.50 --> 3340.68]  And so I can see why they make you wait after someone's res,
[3340.76 --> 3343.18]  because otherwise that would be a super cheap move or whatever else.
[3343.18 --> 3346.18]  But honestly, the boss fights are, like, so long that...
[3347.22 --> 3348.10]  I don't know.
[3348.16 --> 3350.04]  I'm pretty sure they could have balanced it if they really wanted to.
[3350.04 --> 3355.14]  Anyway, the point is that you have one character that can hit for eight.
[3355.68 --> 3359.58]  And that character is not the one that you are locked to in that fight.
[3359.78 --> 3361.70]  So you must have at least these two.
[3362.42 --> 3364.92]  And then you can essentially swap out the other one.
[3365.00 --> 3367.98]  And then the most you can do with anyone else is maybe three or four in one go.
[3368.28 --> 3371.56]  And that would be to sometimes multiple targets, sometimes to a single target.
[3371.60 --> 3372.84]  But that eight one is a single target.
[3373.30 --> 3376.44]  Now, you can only do that, obviously, if you haven't been...
[3376.44 --> 3379.90]  haven't had someone one-hitted and then have to spend a cycle picking them up.
[3379.90 --> 3381.50]  How often does this one-shot happen?
[3381.56 --> 3382.38]  And is it avoidable?
[3382.50 --> 3383.98]  Pretty often, no, it's not avoidable.
[3384.10 --> 3386.10]  And you were asking about cleaving the barrier.
[3386.20 --> 3387.04]  The answer is no.
[3388.14 --> 3389.80]  You cannot eliminate the barrier.
[3390.04 --> 3393.06]  You can cast barrier that will absorb up to five hits.
[3393.40 --> 3397.34]  But most enemy attacks, other than just, like, a basic strike,
[3397.82 --> 3399.70]  will eliminate your barrier.
[3399.82 --> 3401.46]  It'll absorb some damage, but it'll be gone.
[3401.46 --> 3404.20]  So it's an imbalanced barrier mechanic.
[3404.98 --> 3408.96]  It can cast it, as far as I can tell, whenever it wants,
[3409.08 --> 3411.06]  on its entire supporting party.
[3411.58 --> 3414.34]  And so what happened was I knew about the barrier thing.
[3414.60 --> 3417.82]  I knew that it could hit itself and the other wolves around it.
[3417.86 --> 3420.32]  But I'd had pretty good luck clearing out the crowd
[3420.32 --> 3424.30]  and making sure that it couldn't hit a large enough crowd with this barrier thing.
[3424.38 --> 3427.70]  And then finally, I lost it a couple of times,
[3427.76 --> 3429.28]  even though I am at the recommended level.
[3429.28 --> 3432.90]  And finally, I had one where it actually cast barrier.
[3432.94 --> 3433.98]  I should have taken a picture of it,
[3434.00 --> 3435.24]  because it would have been kind of funny to show you.
[3435.30 --> 3440.04]  But it's this entire army of completely invulnerable opponents
[3440.04 --> 3442.32]  until I can hit them each 20 times.
[3442.96 --> 3444.38]  And I'm just sitting here going,
[3444.82 --> 3449.98]  if they playtested this at all, that's not fun.
[3450.62 --> 3451.66]  That's not fair.
[3452.00 --> 3453.54]  There are strategies you can use.
[3453.60 --> 3455.72]  Like, I looked it up, old school style, right?
[3455.76 --> 3456.96]  Okay, how do I beat this boss?
[3456.96 --> 3459.66]  And it's like, oh, okay, this one character has an ability
[3459.66 --> 3462.16]  that if you happen to invest in that branch in the tech tree
[3462.16 --> 3463.26]  and you've played around with it,
[3463.54 --> 3465.02]  you'll know it can be useful for this.
[3465.28 --> 3466.82]  And it's like a vacuum.
[3467.00 --> 3468.90]  It's like a suction ability that takes all the enemies
[3468.90 --> 3471.66]  and puts them in one place so that your multi-hit...
[3471.66 --> 3472.02]  Single targets.
[3472.30 --> 3474.36]  So that essentially you can hit them all in one go.
[3474.82 --> 3477.04]  Except even that didn't solve it, because I cheesed it.
[3477.08 --> 3479.24]  I looked it up and I was like, okay, I'm going to use vacuum.
[3479.70 --> 3481.80]  But now I must have a fixed party.
[3481.80 --> 3483.02]  I have to have the guy that's locked,
[3483.30 --> 3485.56]  the guy that can actually hit for multiple hits,
[3485.68 --> 3487.30]  and then I have to have vacuum buddy,
[3487.80 --> 3489.56]  who's essentially a chemist,
[3489.90 --> 3494.92]  which is like, fine, but not great DPS.
[3495.40 --> 3498.36]  And oh yeah, did I mention the boss has like a ton of health?
[3498.62 --> 3500.96]  So it's going to be a long fight no matter what you do.
[3501.32 --> 3503.62]  So you can cheese it with this, but guess what?
[3503.72 --> 3505.30]  Vacuum doesn't have 100% hit rate.
[3505.30 --> 3507.36]  So even when I cheesed it,
[3508.26 --> 3510.86]  I missed like three of them on a vacuum,
[3511.12 --> 3512.20]  and then it cast barrier.
[3512.96 --> 3514.42]  And at that point, it's unbeatable.
[3515.62 --> 3516.86]  And I'm sitting here going,
[3517.68 --> 3521.44]  well, okay then, there's another cheese you can do.
[3521.52 --> 3523.82]  Apparently one of the guys has like a payback type ability.
[3524.08 --> 3527.04]  So if he takes a bunch of damage, he can pay it back.
[3527.16 --> 3529.72]  But that just counts on you managing to crowd control
[3529.72 --> 3530.78]  and stay alive long enough.
[3531.12 --> 3533.94]  Now, the obvious solution to this, grind a few levels.
[3535.30 --> 3536.68]  But once again-
[3536.68 --> 3537.96]  Which is why you think it feels like
[3537.96 --> 3540.28]  it was incentivizing staying on the subscription.
[3540.54 --> 3541.40]  Oh, it gets worse than that.
[3541.96 --> 3545.48]  Once again, the mobile subscription nature of the game
[3545.48 --> 3546.68]  rears its ugly head.
[3546.78 --> 3549.12]  But this time, because it was intended
[3549.12 --> 3551.24]  as a multi-part release, right?
[3551.28 --> 3551.82]  Like I waited.
[3551.92 --> 3553.88]  I'm like, I'm not playing part one, then part whatever.
[3554.06 --> 3555.48]  I want to know how many parts there are.
[3555.50 --> 3557.02]  And I want to sit down and I want to play it in one go.
[3557.28 --> 3559.16]  But because I'm apparently getting close
[3559.16 --> 3560.36]  to the end of part one,
[3561.18 --> 3563.94]  what happens is the leveling curve changes.
[3563.94 --> 3567.76]  And the experience that you gain for fighting
[3567.76 --> 3571.54]  sort of this tier in this version of the world,
[3571.88 --> 3574.74]  this part enemies goes dramatically down.
[3575.14 --> 3577.18]  So if I was to try to grind it,
[3577.60 --> 3580.48]  I could be playing for hours and hours and hours
[3580.48 --> 3584.18]  just to do a little bit more damage against this thing.
[3584.18 --> 3587.62]  When the problem isn't even that I'm not doing enough damage,
[3588.00 --> 3589.96]  like that might help with crowd control a little bit.
[3590.10 --> 3591.58]  And okay, it could make it beatable.
[3591.58 --> 3595.68]  But the real problem is that this is an utterly imbalanced fight
[3595.68 --> 3597.16]  and that it's not fair.
[3597.44 --> 3598.64]  Guys, he didn't mean cheesing
[3598.64 --> 3600.56]  because he was using characters' abilities.
[3600.70 --> 3602.60]  He meant cheesing because he looked up how to do it online.
[3602.60 --> 3603.82]  Yeah, yeah, that's cheesy.
[3604.00 --> 3605.38]  I like figuring things out.
[3605.48 --> 3607.42]  Like there's one, okay, there's one boss
[3607.42 --> 3611.64]  that also is pretty, um, pretty gross.
[3611.92 --> 3615.16]  It gets to cast poison on you every single turn.
[3615.26 --> 3616.18]  Not its turn.
[3617.26 --> 3619.94]  Every turn it gets to cast poison on you.
[3619.94 --> 3624.90]  So unless you happened to get a bunch of like poison resist stones
[3624.90 --> 3626.52]  that you can equip or whatever else,
[3626.64 --> 3629.60]  you are poisoned literally the entire time.
[3630.24 --> 3633.10]  And there are other things you might want to equip that aren't poison.
[3633.26 --> 3634.16]  And at that stage in the game,
[3634.18 --> 3637.16]  you can only have one of these gems for each of your characters.
[3638.52 --> 3640.48]  But, you know, I figured it out.
[3640.58 --> 3644.94]  I figured out that you can block poison with that barrier spell.
[3645.68 --> 3646.50]  It'll block poison.
[3646.50 --> 3649.22]  So at least my entire party wouldn't be poisoned all the time.
[3649.30 --> 3650.88]  Just whoever got their barrier knocked down.
[3651.20 --> 3651.94]  Like, okay, fine.
[3652.02 --> 3653.08]  You know, I can work around that.
[3653.34 --> 3655.42]  But when there's a one hit, that is,
[3655.54 --> 3657.18]  and it's like a way overkill one hit.
[3657.26 --> 3658.88]  Like there's no amount of leveling up
[3658.88 --> 3660.76]  that would make it not a one hit anymore.
[3661.68 --> 3662.98]  It's just not fun.
[3663.28 --> 3666.58]  I don't want to just sit and res and just use Phoenix Downs.
[3666.58 --> 3670.02]  I find completely random one hit mechanics
[3670.02 --> 3672.26]  to be very lazy game design, in my opinion.
[3673.24 --> 3676.96]  Unless there's, you know, things that you can do.
[3677.02 --> 3677.32]  Yes.
[3677.78 --> 3678.54]  Then it's fine.
[3678.70 --> 3679.48]  And there isn't.
[3679.70 --> 3679.94]  Yeah.
[3680.08 --> 3681.82]  Like there's another one where,
[3681.94 --> 3683.24]  I had to look this one up too,
[3683.30 --> 3684.70]  where you can blind it.
[3686.18 --> 3688.40]  And there's like some gaze move that it uses.
[3688.44 --> 3689.36]  But at least there were hints.
[3689.50 --> 3691.44]  Like I looked it up and I was like,
[3691.44 --> 3694.62]  okay, that kind of makes sense or something.
[3695.46 --> 3698.00]  So if you blind it, it can't use its gaze ability.
[3698.12 --> 3699.70]  But this one, as far as I can tell,
[3699.74 --> 3700.88]  it's just immune to everything.
[3701.32 --> 3706.74]  And one hits you and casts barrier on everything.
[3708.10 --> 3708.92]  Kuzan Chick says,
[3709.00 --> 3711.18]  honestly, it feels like Linus doesn't play many Japanese games.
[3711.72 --> 3713.30]  The problem is not the difficulty.
[3713.30 --> 3717.34]  The problem is the unfunness of the way
[3717.34 --> 3718.50]  that the fight is balanced.
[3718.66 --> 3721.08]  And what's really frustrating is I feel like
[3721.08 --> 3723.26]  they were almost a victim of their own ambition here
[3723.26 --> 3726.84]  because a lot of the game is really creative.
[3727.48 --> 3731.24]  They've done an incredible job of making boss fights
[3731.24 --> 3734.30]  not just feel like a grind in a lot of cases.
[3734.98 --> 3736.86]  And even the random battles,
[3737.08 --> 3738.82]  they've got this awesome mechanic
[3738.82 --> 3740.56]  where random battles do hit you randomly,
[3740.86 --> 3744.08]  but you can enable this device that you carry
[3744.08 --> 3746.56]  called a Dimension that will absorb anywhere
[3746.56 --> 3750.24]  from 10 to five random encounters.
[3750.24 --> 3751.80]  And then you fight them all at once.
[3751.82 --> 3752.48]  Oh, it piles them all up?
[3752.52 --> 3753.12]  You told me about that.
[3753.26 --> 3754.28]  That actually sounds super cool.
[3754.34 --> 3755.82]  Yeah, so you get way more time
[3755.82 --> 3758.34]  to just experience the environments.
[3759.08 --> 3760.90]  And then the fight is probably like really epic.
[3761.06 --> 3763.30]  And the fight is actually way more fun,
[3763.42 --> 3765.16]  especially because so many of the abilities
[3765.16 --> 3768.00]  can be chained or can pierce
[3768.00 --> 3769.96]  or can be curved and arced and stuff.
[3769.96 --> 3774.28]  Like it's actually really fun when it's really fun.
[3774.28 --> 3778.74]  It's just that it's obvious that it didn't get proper QA
[3778.74 --> 3782.88]  because when you reach a non-progression,
[3782.88 --> 3785.04]  I consider a non-progression point,
[3785.28 --> 3787.22]  if your whole party is up
[3787.22 --> 3792.78]  and all that happened was you had an ability
[3792.78 --> 3795.46]  that RNG didn't grab enough of those guys
[3795.46 --> 3798.96]  and it just can RNG cast this ability
[3798.96 --> 3800.34]  that completely ends it
[3800.34 --> 3802.68]  and you're like half an hour into a stupid fight.
[3802.68 --> 3807.48]  Lots of Japanese and Korean games expect you to farm.
[3808.88 --> 3810.70]  Sure, but I can't even farm.
[3810.70 --> 3812.88]  So is the problem because the curve is so low at that point?
[3813.40 --> 3813.58]  Yeah.
[3813.58 --> 3814.40]  That's the core problem?
[3814.48 --> 3816.54]  Yeah, so I can't just grind.
[3817.04 --> 3818.70]  Yeah, because the curve's so low.
[3818.86 --> 3818.98]  Okay.
[3819.16 --> 3821.76]  Like I don't even mind grinding once in a while.
[3822.12 --> 3823.50]  Okay, so that's another issue.
[3823.74 --> 3825.00]  There was another one I ran into,
[3825.12 --> 3826.12]  which is in this place.
[3826.22 --> 3827.18]  For those of you who have played it,
[3827.20 --> 3828.82]  as far as I can tell, not many people have.
[3828.88 --> 3830.28]  There's not a lot of discussion about it,
[3830.28 --> 3832.84]  but there's a section called the Triangle of Calamity
[3832.84 --> 3834.94]  that I accidentally wandered into at some point.
[3834.98 --> 3835.42]  Sounds cool.
[3835.48 --> 3837.18]  I didn't think there was a way to get out of it,
[3837.24 --> 3838.46]  so I had to look that up as well
[3838.46 --> 3840.42]  because I ran into a boss fight there
[3840.42 --> 3843.56]  where even after spending an hour or two
[3843.56 --> 3846.24]  just grinding, just leveling up
[3846.24 --> 3849.06]  because the issue there was that
[3849.06 --> 3852.34]  one of my characters who I really needed
[3852.34 --> 3855.60]  because their abilities are the weakness
[3855.60 --> 3856.68]  of the boss or whatever,
[3857.12 --> 3859.54]  was way lower because I rescued her way later
[3859.54 --> 3860.90]  in the time when the party splits up.
[3861.00 --> 3862.24]  Anyway, the point is,
[3862.34 --> 3863.72]  I did a bunch of grinding there
[3863.72 --> 3865.24]  and that was when I figured out
[3865.24 --> 3866.76]  that the higher level ones
[3866.76 --> 3868.40]  were basically not moving anymore.
[3868.84 --> 3870.48]  These lower ones were leveling up.
[3870.50 --> 3870.66]  Yeah.
[3870.98 --> 3872.56]  But I went into this fight
[3872.56 --> 3874.74]  and I also couldn't win that one,
[3875.16 --> 3876.22]  even with grinding
[3876.22 --> 3877.86]  because it also had a cheap mechanic
[3877.86 --> 3879.48]  where it splits into three of itself
[3879.48 --> 3883.20]  and it's randomized which ones do what.
[3883.32 --> 3884.50]  And so if you happen to hit it
[3884.50 --> 3886.40]  with an ability that marks it
[3886.40 --> 3887.80]  so you can taunt them,
[3887.94 --> 3889.64]  if you happen to hit it before it splits,
[3889.80 --> 3891.74]  then you can tell which one is real,
[3891.80 --> 3893.76]  but if you don't and you hit them,
[3894.24 --> 3895.60]  they hit you super hard
[3895.60 --> 3897.68]  to the point where it's one or two turns wasted
[3897.68 --> 3899.00]  in order to pick up a guy again.
[3899.14 --> 3901.04]  It's ridiculous.
[3901.52 --> 3902.82]  So I went straight from that one
[3902.82 --> 3905.72]  over to the other one
[3905.72 --> 3908.08]  and this barrier thing.
[3908.12 --> 3909.44]  I was looking at nine wolves
[3909.44 --> 3911.10]  with 20 hit barriers on it
[3911.10 --> 3912.12]  and I'm just like...
[3912.12 --> 3913.22]  I don't even want to play anymore.
[3913.30 --> 3914.28]  Yeah, I don't even want to play anymore.
[3914.28 --> 3914.30]  It's not even fun.
[3914.30 --> 3915.40]  You might be able to get through this,
[3915.46 --> 3916.52]  but it's just like, oh man.
[3916.90 --> 3918.20]  Yeah, why am I bothering?
[3918.40 --> 3919.78]  This isn't fun.
[3920.40 --> 3921.06]  This is one of the reasons
[3921.06 --> 3923.48]  why I actually like FTL so much
[3923.48 --> 3925.76]  is the final boss fight.
[3927.08 --> 3928.80]  It's very satisfying
[3928.80 --> 3932.02]  because there's three stages to it
[3932.02 --> 3934.00]  and in between every stage,
[3934.46 --> 3935.66]  it's a spaceship game.
[3935.88 --> 3936.92]  In between every stage,
[3937.24 --> 3938.64]  the boss will warp away.
[3939.48 --> 3940.44]  So you kind of have a second
[3940.44 --> 3941.58]  to lick your wounds
[3941.58 --> 3943.68]  and get everything kind of back in order.
[3944.28 --> 3946.28]  But you can't travel
[3946.28 --> 3947.46]  because it's going to come right back
[3947.46 --> 3948.72]  and you're trying to defend this base.
[3948.98 --> 3949.30]  Right.
[3949.50 --> 3950.70]  So you have enough time to like...
[3950.70 --> 3953.04]  If there's literally fires and holes
[3953.04 --> 3954.76]  on or in your ship,
[3954.88 --> 3956.18]  you can patch it up.
[3956.74 --> 3958.28]  Yeah, Fantasian has a boss
[3958.28 --> 3958.84]  that's like that.
[3959.16 --> 3960.30]  It's running away from you
[3960.30 --> 3961.94]  and you can kind of...
[3961.94 --> 3963.16]  If you wait too long
[3963.16 --> 3964.06]  to start attacking it
[3964.06 --> 3965.16]  and like catching up to it,
[3965.46 --> 3966.50]  then it like gets away.
[3966.90 --> 3967.04]  Yeah.
[3967.10 --> 3968.28]  But if you don't wait too long,
[3968.38 --> 3969.92]  you do have a little bit of time to...
[3969.92 --> 3970.52]  You can like take care of yourself
[3970.52 --> 3970.92]  for a second,
[3971.00 --> 3971.66]  then re-engage.
[3971.78 --> 3971.90]  Yeah.
[3972.02 --> 3973.24]  I think that's really cool
[3973.24 --> 3974.34]  and like the ways
[3974.34 --> 3977.10]  that the fight evolves over time
[3977.10 --> 3978.06]  as you fight it
[3978.06 --> 3979.50]  is interesting.
[3979.50 --> 3981.76]  I have always wanted
[3981.76 --> 3984.40]  like an FTL 2 to come out.
[3984.96 --> 3985.36]  Instead,
[3985.48 --> 3986.58]  they worked on another game
[3986.58 --> 3987.34]  called Into the Breach,
[3987.38 --> 3988.24]  which was cool.
[3988.40 --> 3989.96]  I'm not particularly super into it,
[3990.00 --> 3990.50]  but it's cool.
[3991.20 --> 3992.76]  I do hope that they make
[3992.76 --> 3993.98]  another iteration of it
[3993.98 --> 3994.38]  at some point.
[3994.48 --> 3996.68]  I've always wanted it to...
[3996.68 --> 3997.04]  There's...
[3997.04 --> 3998.10]  If I remember correctly,
[3998.22 --> 3999.96]  there's eight zones
[3999.96 --> 4001.50]  in the game.
[4001.74 --> 4002.50]  The eighth zone
[4002.50 --> 4003.52]  being where the boss is.
[4003.92 --> 4004.86]  And I kind of wish
[4004.86 --> 4006.38]  at the end of every zone,
[4006.50 --> 4007.72]  there was like a mini boss
[4007.72 --> 4008.30]  of some sort.
[4008.30 --> 4008.74]  Right.
[4008.92 --> 4009.88]  I think that would be cool.
[4010.40 --> 4011.82]  But yeah,
[4012.00 --> 4012.44]  I don't know.
[4012.78 --> 4013.46]  CW says,
[4013.54 --> 4014.56]  LTT is the only channel
[4014.56 --> 4015.10]  I've ever seen
[4015.10 --> 4016.58]  that claims they can't read Super Chat.
[4016.68 --> 4018.00]  Sounds like a loadable to me.
[4018.32 --> 4019.54]  We've shown screenshots of it
[4019.54 --> 4020.36]  lots of times
[4020.36 --> 4021.54]  how the dashboard didn't work.
[4021.60 --> 4022.62]  It actually does work now,
[4022.72 --> 4023.84]  but I'm just over it
[4023.84 --> 4025.04]  at this point.
[4026.62 --> 4027.02]  Yep.
[4027.78 --> 4028.22]  There you go.
[4028.30 --> 4028.98]  If you Super Chat,
[4029.06 --> 4030.24]  it'll show up at the top thing
[4030.24 --> 4031.10]  for people that are watching
[4031.10 --> 4031.50]  on YouTube.
[4031.68 --> 4031.88]  Yeah.
[4031.98 --> 4032.92]  So that'll be cool.
[4034.36 --> 4035.42]  FTL's really well balanced.
[4035.62 --> 4035.78]  Yeah.
[4036.12 --> 4036.44]  There's...
[4036.44 --> 4036.70]  I mean,
[4036.70 --> 4039.72]  like with pretty much any game,
[4039.94 --> 4041.34]  there's things that are stronger
[4041.34 --> 4042.52]  and there's things that are weaker.
[4042.84 --> 4044.52]  But I personally find the balance
[4044.52 --> 4046.12]  in FTL to be fantastic.
[4046.28 --> 4047.62]  And I really like how
[4047.62 --> 4049.16]  with all the different ships and stuff,
[4049.20 --> 4049.78]  you can have these
[4049.78 --> 4051.94]  really interesting different feels
[4051.94 --> 4054.04]  to the run that you take.
[4054.42 --> 4055.18]  Okay, here we go.
[4055.18 --> 4057.16]  Citizen Bean posts on Floatplane,
[4057.28 --> 4057.92]  straight from Reddit.
[4058.42 --> 4059.30]  Like, excuse me?
[4059.58 --> 4060.46]  20 barriers?
[4060.74 --> 4061.72]  Question mark, question mark.
[4061.72 --> 4064.06]  A basically guaranteed instant death attack?
[4064.42 --> 4066.34]  10 plus allies on the battlefield at once
[4066.34 --> 4067.84]  that can all receive 20 barriers?
[4068.08 --> 4069.90]  This fight is a total clusterf**k.
[4070.20 --> 4072.24]  And even with Arrow Rain plus Samadare
[4072.24 --> 4073.26]  to try to handle the barriers,
[4073.38 --> 4074.70]  it is still ridiculous.
[4075.48 --> 4076.00]  Yeah.
[4076.24 --> 4079.48]  Those mechanics don't sound fun to me.
[4079.48 --> 4084.34]  Like, I tried every possible combination of things
[4084.34 --> 4085.36]  to try to break the barrier.
[4085.44 --> 4086.36]  If you could break the barrier,
[4086.50 --> 4087.08]  no problem.
[4087.20 --> 4087.68]  Let's go.
[4088.22 --> 4090.28]  But an unbreakable 20-hit barrier
[4090.28 --> 4092.16]  is just stupid.
[4092.34 --> 4092.74]  I always hate,
[4092.82 --> 4094.70]  if you're playing like some type of MMO
[4094.70 --> 4095.86]  or even just like,
[4096.16 --> 4098.30]  there's a bunch of these like four-player RPGs
[4098.30 --> 4099.46]  and there's a boss fight
[4099.46 --> 4101.50]  and the boss has an ability
[4101.50 --> 4102.52]  where it just like targets
[4102.52 --> 4103.96]  one of your party members at random
[4103.96 --> 4104.68]  and it's like,
[4104.78 --> 4106.48]  you're dead in 10 seconds.
[4106.48 --> 4108.26]  It's like,
[4108.72 --> 4109.22]  okay,
[4109.84 --> 4111.70]  I guess I'll do what I can for 10 seconds
[4111.70 --> 4113.32]  and then just not be able to play the game.
[4113.48 --> 4115.36]  Like, this isn't a fun mechanic.
[4115.72 --> 4116.86]  Like, please,
[4117.10 --> 4118.60]  like try to find some other way
[4118.60 --> 4120.00]  to add difficulty to this fight.
[4120.28 --> 4121.16]  I don't know what it is.
[4121.30 --> 4122.42]  You can split the party.
[4122.54 --> 4124.16]  Like, there's interesting things that you can do
[4124.16 --> 4125.82]  to reduce the amount of party members.
[4125.98 --> 4127.48]  But when you take two,
[4127.80 --> 4128.68]  one or two party members,
[4128.76 --> 4129.74]  don't just kill them.
[4130.34 --> 4131.82]  Put them in like a different scenario.
[4132.10 --> 4133.92]  Make it so that there's like some hallway
[4133.92 --> 4134.42]  they have to,
[4134.52 --> 4136.30]  they get like teleported back or something
[4136.30 --> 4138.14]  and have to solo fight through this hallway
[4138.14 --> 4139.72]  and to regain with the party
[4139.72 --> 4140.20]  or whatever it is.
[4140.26 --> 4140.64]  I don't know.
[4140.92 --> 4141.98]  There's other things that you can do.
[4142.18 --> 4142.52]  But like...
[4142.52 --> 4144.48]  Twitch chat's having a pretty good moment over here
[4144.48 --> 4146.76]  asking if I tried suplexing the boss
[4146.76 --> 4148.06]  or casting Vanish in Doom.
[4151.32 --> 4152.08]  You know what?
[4152.16 --> 4152.64]  Yeah, sure.
[4152.72 --> 4154.54]  There might be like a bugged way to beat it,
[4154.62 --> 4156.02]  but I'd rather not play a game
[4156.02 --> 4157.52]  than do that, quite honestly.
[4157.98 --> 4158.12]  Yeah.
[4158.38 --> 4158.64]  Yeah.
[4161.14 --> 4162.14]  So yeah, it just,
[4162.26 --> 4162.60]  I don't know.
[4162.64 --> 4163.50]  It made me really sad
[4163.50 --> 4164.20]  because it was a game
[4164.20 --> 4165.10]  I really wanted to play
[4165.10 --> 4166.52]  and I feel like it was,
[4166.52 --> 4168.10]  it was doomed
[4168.10 --> 4170.22]  to not be as good as it could be
[4170.22 --> 4172.06]  because of what it is
[4172.06 --> 4173.44]  and because of how it was funded.
[4173.84 --> 4174.50]  If, oh, okay.
[4174.60 --> 4175.44]  So I was going to say,
[4175.48 --> 4176.84]  if you had to pick one or the other,
[4176.88 --> 4177.82]  do you think it's more
[4177.82 --> 4179.16]  the funding,
[4179.34 --> 4179.90]  lack of time,
[4179.98 --> 4180.64]  lack of QA?
[4180.72 --> 4181.04]  Absolutely.
[4181.50 --> 4182.60]  So you don't think
[4182.60 --> 4184.02]  it's more the mobile design?
[4184.14 --> 4186.18]  No, the creativity was so high.
[4186.56 --> 4188.22]  The mobile issue is,
[4188.34 --> 4190.20]  well, they're part and parcel, right?
[4190.20 --> 4192.68]  It's built for the subscription model
[4192.68 --> 4195.00]  where revenue cannot be easily attributed
[4195.00 --> 4197.78]  to that title, right?
[4197.80 --> 4199.66]  So yes, you can see playtime,
[4199.88 --> 4202.30]  but that doesn't necessarily tell you,
[4203.06 --> 4203.98]  and like,
[4204.22 --> 4205.24]  I don't know how many people
[4205.24 --> 4207.36]  are subscribed to Apple Arcade, right?
[4208.00 --> 4210.52]  I suspect that it's a lot less
[4210.52 --> 4211.62]  than this would have sold
[4211.62 --> 4212.66]  if it had come out
[4212.66 --> 4213.98]  as a dedicated release for Switch.
[4214.00 --> 4214.40]  Oh yeah.
[4214.60 --> 4215.38]  In terms of revenue.
[4215.54 --> 4218.18]  I mean, these are industry legends.
[4219.10 --> 4219.86]  I would have bought it
[4219.86 --> 4220.44]  if I was on Switch.
[4220.54 --> 4221.98]  And the demand for, you know,
[4222.06 --> 4223.80]  traditional style JRPGs,
[4224.38 --> 4225.32]  warts and all,
[4225.58 --> 4227.32]  is pretty high.
[4227.40 --> 4228.38]  Like, you look at the number
[4228.38 --> 4230.74]  of kind of smaller indie games
[4230.74 --> 4232.16]  that are sort of chasing
[4232.16 --> 4236.16]  that older sort of SNES era style, right?
[4236.28 --> 4237.42]  Like, there's a couple
[4237.42 --> 4238.48]  that are on my to-play list
[4238.48 --> 4240.20]  that I am super excited about.
[4244.20 --> 4247.58]  But it was an utter disappointment,
[4247.78 --> 4248.10]  this one.
[4249.18 --> 4250.04]  That is sad.
[4250.68 --> 4251.72]  Game development's hard.
[4254.36 --> 4255.10]  And it was just,
[4255.16 --> 4256.42]  it had so many good ideas.
[4257.78 --> 4258.22]  Yeah.
[4258.32 --> 4258.68]  Like, really,
[4258.74 --> 4259.76]  I was really enjoying it.
[4259.82 --> 4260.78]  Music's so good.
[4261.14 --> 4262.42]  Like, just everything about it
[4262.42 --> 4262.86]  was awesome.
[4263.10 --> 4263.94]  I know you sort of
[4263.94 --> 4264.86]  already answered this,
[4265.22 --> 4266.22]  but if you had some way
[4266.22 --> 4267.58]  to just delete that boss,
[4268.44 --> 4269.60]  would you do it
[4269.60 --> 4270.54]  and then keep pushing forward?
[4270.76 --> 4271.94]  Yeah, I'd like to keep playing it,
[4271.98 --> 4272.62]  but I'm just worried
[4272.62 --> 4273.36]  that it's just not going
[4273.36 --> 4273.98]  to get any better
[4273.98 --> 4275.68]  because it's just such
[4275.68 --> 4277.42]  an obvious QA problem.
[4277.92 --> 4279.46]  If they had had enough people
[4279.46 --> 4280.38]  play through this,
[4280.94 --> 4282.38]  they would have found this error.
[4282.82 --> 4284.90]  It's an error.
[4285.34 --> 4285.84]  Like, it is...
[4285.84 --> 4287.30]  With how their development path went,
[4287.98 --> 4289.26]  they might have had to
[4289.26 --> 4291.28]  crunch really super hard
[4291.28 --> 4292.82]  to get that first act out
[4292.82 --> 4295.20]  and had bad QA because of it.
[4295.28 --> 4296.28]  Yeah, that's what I suspect.
[4296.28 --> 4297.28]  And then...
[4297.28 --> 4298.42]  But they might not have had
[4298.42 --> 4298.98]  to crunch as hard
[4298.98 --> 4299.94]  for the further acts.
[4300.24 --> 4301.02]  Yeah, maybe.
[4302.24 --> 4302.80]  Thunderclash says,
[4302.88 --> 4303.38]  some of the bosses
[4303.38 --> 4304.56]  are ridiculously hard
[4304.56 --> 4305.26]  to the point that
[4305.26 --> 4306.12]  Hironobu Sakaguchi
[4306.12 --> 4307.08]  had to release videos
[4307.08 --> 4307.56]  in his channel
[4307.56 --> 4308.70]  showing how to beat some bosses.
[4308.86 --> 4309.24]  Oh, wow.
[4309.70 --> 4311.78]  I mean, as long as there are hints,
[4312.20 --> 4313.26]  you know, in the gameplay
[4313.26 --> 4314.74]  that tell you...
[4314.74 --> 4315.74]  Then, fine, you know.
[4315.80 --> 4316.76]  Okay, I had to look it up.
[4317.18 --> 4318.12]  I don't mind.
[4318.36 --> 4319.52]  I would rather...
[4319.52 --> 4320.56]  Like, if I can't figure out
[4320.56 --> 4321.26]  how to beat something
[4321.26 --> 4321.68]  in a game,
[4321.70 --> 4322.32]  which happens,
[4322.46 --> 4323.54]  and I have to look it up,
[4323.94 --> 4325.02]  I would rather...
[4325.02 --> 4326.14]  I look it up and go like,
[4326.24 --> 4328.66]  oh, yeah, I'm stupid.
[4329.00 --> 4329.22]  Yeah.
[4329.60 --> 4330.94]  Instead of, I look it up
[4330.94 --> 4331.44]  and I go,
[4331.88 --> 4333.56]  there's no possible way
[4333.56 --> 4333.90]  I would have ever...
[4333.90 --> 4334.74]  No way I could have known that.
[4334.96 --> 4336.10]  You were supposed to look
[4336.10 --> 4337.00]  at the symbol
[4337.00 --> 4338.04]  in the bottom left-hand corner
[4338.04 --> 4338.86]  on the bottom
[4338.86 --> 4340.16]  of the physical box
[4340.16 --> 4341.64]  when you took it home.
[4341.74 --> 4342.60]  Like, no.
[4342.96 --> 4343.56]  I don't...
[4343.56 --> 4344.06]  Screw off.
[4344.10 --> 4345.38]  I looked up two things
[4345.38 --> 4346.26]  in Breath of the Wild.
[4347.12 --> 4348.26]  In, like, some...
[4348.26 --> 4350.06]  In the cult headquarters,
[4350.40 --> 4351.20]  I looked up
[4351.20 --> 4352.74]  how to get through this wall.
[4353.06 --> 4354.08]  I was stuck in this room.
[4354.08 --> 4354.74]  There's this, like,
[4354.82 --> 4355.44]  stealth section.
[4356.04 --> 4356.22]  And...
[4356.22 --> 4356.98]  Did you play Breath of the Wild?
[4357.28 --> 4357.46]  You know?
[4357.50 --> 4358.12]  You never...
[4358.12 --> 4358.60]  I played part of it.
[4358.62 --> 4359.28]  You didn't finish it.
[4359.50 --> 4361.50]  I adopted it as my
[4361.50 --> 4362.28]  I'm gonna play this
[4362.28 --> 4363.14]  on planes game.
[4363.52 --> 4364.48]  And then travel stopped.
[4364.56 --> 4364.94]  I get it.
[4365.02 --> 4365.26]  Yes.
[4365.46 --> 4365.64]  Cool.
[4366.04 --> 4366.90]  Okay, so anyway,
[4367.22 --> 4369.02]  there's this, like,
[4369.10 --> 4369.80]  stealth section,
[4370.38 --> 4372.30]  and I would get
[4372.30 --> 4372.96]  to the end room.
[4373.04 --> 4373.22]  I'm like,
[4373.26 --> 4374.08]  this has to be...
[4374.08 --> 4374.90]  This has to be where...
[4374.90 --> 4375.64]  I couldn't figure out
[4375.64 --> 4376.04]  where to go.
[4376.40 --> 4376.86]  And then...
[4376.86 --> 4377.82]  So I finally...
[4377.82 --> 4379.86]  I felt like an idiot
[4379.86 --> 4381.64]  because you just have to switch
[4381.64 --> 4382.10]  to, like,
[4382.14 --> 4384.02]  your Sheikah something,
[4384.48 --> 4384.80]  something.
[4385.00 --> 4385.16]  Anyway,
[4385.24 --> 4386.46]  one of the walls is magnetic
[4386.46 --> 4387.30]  and you can, like,
[4387.32 --> 4387.96]  move it or something.
[4388.18 --> 4388.94]  Or you can throw a thing through.
[4388.98 --> 4389.44]  I can't remember.
[4389.50 --> 4390.06]  You can blow it up.
[4390.36 --> 4391.02]  I don't remember,
[4391.08 --> 4392.50]  but if I had just turned on,
[4392.56 --> 4393.54]  like, it's like...
[4393.54 --> 4394.30]  It would be like playing
[4394.30 --> 4395.76]  Batman Arkham Asylum.
[4395.98 --> 4397.12]  Not being able to figure out
[4397.12 --> 4397.64]  what to do
[4397.64 --> 4399.02]  and not using detective vision
[4399.02 --> 4399.66]  or whatever, right?
[4399.70 --> 4401.72]  Like, it just felt like an idiot.
[4401.88 --> 4402.90]  I don't mind stuff like that.
[4402.96 --> 4404.08]  It's way easier to absorb
[4404.08 --> 4405.08]  because I can deal with
[4405.08 --> 4406.58]  just me being dumb.
[4406.58 --> 4407.94]  But the second thing
[4407.94 --> 4409.92]  I looked up in Breath of the Wild
[4409.92 --> 4411.86]  is, like, some...
[4411.86 --> 4413.78]  It was some quest or something
[4413.78 --> 4415.30]  where you have to find
[4415.30 --> 4417.98]  the thing between the thing
[4417.98 --> 4419.14]  that looks like a thing
[4419.14 --> 4421.10]  and I found somewhere in the game
[4421.10 --> 4423.24]  that matched the description perfectly.
[4423.38 --> 4424.06]  And you know how big
[4424.06 --> 4425.14]  that game world is?
[4426.38 --> 4428.34]  And so I spent all this time,
[4428.40 --> 4429.96]  like, wandering around there,
[4430.30 --> 4432.20]  just, like, fighting things
[4432.20 --> 4433.30]  and looking for...
[4433.30 --> 4435.18]  I forget if it was a chest
[4435.18 --> 4435.92]  or an entrance to a thing.
[4435.92 --> 4436.68]  I haven't played this game either,
[4436.78 --> 4437.92]  but I do know all the things
[4437.92 --> 4439.10]  you're talking about so far
[4439.10 --> 4440.62]  because I had to benchmark it.
[4441.36 --> 4441.82]  Right, okay.
[4441.82 --> 4442.84]  And I had to find, like,
[4442.86 --> 4443.94]  a benchmarking section
[4443.94 --> 4445.76]  and eventually there was this, like,
[4445.98 --> 4447.66]  room that you could fight in
[4447.66 --> 4448.16]  that would spawn
[4448.16 --> 4450.00]  exactly consistent enemies
[4450.00 --> 4451.46]  in exactly consistent positions
[4451.46 --> 4452.18]  and you could do
[4452.18 --> 4453.14]  the exact set of moves
[4453.14 --> 4453.86]  against them every time
[4453.86 --> 4454.40]  and it worked fine.
[4454.54 --> 4456.06]  So I remember that.
[4456.40 --> 4457.70]  Wait, from Breath of the Wild?
[4457.82 --> 4459.18]  No, Arkham Asylum.
[4459.48 --> 4460.56]  Oh, oh, Arkham Asylum.
[4460.68 --> 4461.04]  Oh, okay.
[4461.24 --> 4461.78]  Yeah, no, no.
[4461.84 --> 4462.46]  I'm not talking about
[4462.46 --> 4463.22]  Breath of the Wild again.
[4463.46 --> 4463.82]  Oh, okay.
[4463.88 --> 4465.06]  Yeah, so there's this, like, quest.
[4465.06 --> 4466.58]  You have to be, like,
[4466.60 --> 4467.18]  on a mountain
[4467.18 --> 4468.34]  and it has to be night
[4468.34 --> 4469.20]  and it has to be this
[4469.20 --> 4469.92]  and it has to be that
[4469.92 --> 4470.34]  or something
[4470.34 --> 4471.06]  and I found a spot
[4471.06 --> 4471.94]  that actually matches
[4471.94 --> 4472.48]  the description
[4472.48 --> 4473.90]  so I had to look that one up
[4473.90 --> 4474.44]  and I was like,
[4475.16 --> 4476.32]  I wasn't even mad about that one.
[4476.36 --> 4477.24]  I was mad at myself
[4477.24 --> 4478.64]  about the stupid hideout, though.
[4478.84 --> 4479.04]  Yeah.
[4479.12 --> 4479.78]  Super mad.
[4480.48 --> 4482.26]  Yeah, Giga Clan hideout
[4482.26 --> 4483.10]  or whatever it is.
[4483.20 --> 4483.76]  Try the demo,
[4483.84 --> 4484.18]  see what you think.
[4484.42 --> 4484.82]  I've played,
[4484.92 --> 4485.90]  if you're talking about
[4485.90 --> 4486.34]  Breath of the Wild,
[4486.44 --> 4487.84]  I've played a decent amount of it
[4487.84 --> 4488.58]  and I enjoyed it.
[4488.92 --> 4490.54]  I just, I don't know,
[4490.60 --> 4491.90]  my brain never shifted to, like,
[4491.94 --> 4493.06]  hey, I guess we should play this
[4493.06 --> 4493.72]  not on planes
[4493.72 --> 4495.06]  because my whole thing was, like,
[4495.12 --> 4495.96]  I'm enjoying this
[4495.96 --> 4496.70]  but I don't want to, like,
[4496.76 --> 4497.58]  sprint through the game.
[4497.84 --> 4498.64]  I'm just going to play it
[4498.64 --> 4499.28]  when I'm on planes
[4499.28 --> 4500.22]  and then we're good
[4500.22 --> 4501.30]  because I would notice, like,
[4501.32 --> 4502.38]  oh, I have an eight-hour flight,
[4502.90 --> 4504.00]  start playing Breath of the Wild,
[4504.14 --> 4505.50]  feel like I've still
[4505.50 --> 4506.50]  just barely started playing
[4506.50 --> 4507.02]  and I land
[4507.02 --> 4507.60]  and I'm like,
[4507.62 --> 4508.22]  oh, this is great.
[4509.14 --> 4510.44]  I want to keep this superpower.
[4510.58 --> 4511.34]  I don't want to finish it.
[4511.64 --> 4512.20]  Mkirsch asks,
[4512.26 --> 4512.64]  I think I know
[4512.64 --> 4513.40]  what you're talking about.
[4513.48 --> 4514.56]  Is it the one from a crossover
[4514.56 --> 4515.24]  with another game?
[4515.30 --> 4515.94]  I think so.
[4516.38 --> 4517.16]  I think it is.
[4517.82 --> 4518.68]  Oh, that's kind of annoying.
[4519.08 --> 4520.40]  Yeah, this is a really good comment
[4520.40 --> 4522.92]  from Kornosian over on Floatplane.
[4523.38 --> 4524.72]  If you could delete the boss,
[4525.48 --> 4526.64]  if the game gets to the point
[4526.64 --> 4527.68]  where the only way to advance
[4527.68 --> 4528.58]  is to actually cheat,
[4528.68 --> 4529.72]  the game instantly stops
[4529.72 --> 4530.44]  being fun for me
[4530.44 --> 4531.00]  because I know
[4531.00 --> 4532.26]  if it gets inconvenient again,
[4532.34 --> 4533.10]  I'll just cheat again.
[4533.26 --> 4534.38]  I don't want to cheat.
[4534.46 --> 4535.64]  I want to play the game.
[4535.64 --> 4535.96]  That's a pretty good call.
[4536.22 --> 4537.66]  I want to play the game, right?
[4537.66 --> 4539.40]  I don't want to just put in cheat codes.
[4539.48 --> 4540.64]  That's not fun for me.
[4541.28 --> 4541.42]  Right?
[4541.48 --> 4542.26]  It's kind of like,
[4542.38 --> 4544.34]  oh, man.
[4544.42 --> 4545.10]  I mean, it's like anything.
[4545.18 --> 4546.38]  It's like in sports, right?
[4546.94 --> 4549.28]  Like if the only way
[4549.28 --> 4550.68]  to continue to play
[4550.68 --> 4552.06]  is to just cheat,
[4552.52 --> 4553.46]  are you playing?
[4553.58 --> 4554.18]  Are you competing?
[4554.50 --> 4555.04]  Are you...
[4555.04 --> 4556.66]  What's the point even anymore then?
[4557.00 --> 4558.30]  This whole cheating thing
[4558.30 --> 4561.90]  has been a fairly major conversation
[4561.90 --> 4563.62]  in my circles for a bit now.
[4564.70 --> 4566.40]  And we talked about this.
[4566.54 --> 4568.18]  Yeah, you were going to talk about...
[4568.18 --> 4569.82]  So, like, he quit Tarkov.
[4569.94 --> 4570.16]  Yeah.
[4571.64 --> 4572.58]  What the f***?
[4572.60 --> 4573.36]  You quit Tarkov?
[4573.38 --> 4574.02]  Yeah, it's weird.
[4574.02 --> 4575.16]  I've been playing this game
[4575.16 --> 4576.72]  for six years.
[4576.84 --> 4577.44]  Yeah, I know.
[4577.70 --> 4577.92]  Yeah.
[4578.14 --> 4578.90]  And so he just, like,
[4578.94 --> 4579.86]  messaged me on Discord
[4579.86 --> 4580.76]  just, like, out of nowhere.
[4580.86 --> 4581.62]  Yeah, I quit Tarkov.
[4581.76 --> 4582.34]  I'm like...
[4582.34 --> 4582.56]  Yeah.
[4583.12 --> 4584.20]  A, I don't believe you.
[4584.28 --> 4585.12]  And B, what?
[4585.22 --> 4585.44]  Really?
[4585.44 --> 4586.30]  Well, I quit for now.
[4586.38 --> 4587.68]  No, I believe you
[4587.68 --> 4588.76]  now that you explained why.
[4588.86 --> 4590.68]  But, like, let's talk about that.
[4590.82 --> 4592.74]  So, Tarkov was made
[4592.74 --> 4593.94]  by a developer called BSG.
[4595.78 --> 4598.30]  And it's a really fantastic game
[4598.30 --> 4599.60]  because, like, okay,
[4599.70 --> 4600.82]  so I know some people
[4600.82 --> 4601.80]  aren't going to like firearms.
[4601.80 --> 4603.92]  My grandpa was a Marine
[4603.92 --> 4605.10]  and then he got into
[4605.10 --> 4606.66]  the police force afterwards.
[4606.92 --> 4608.48]  He used to train me
[4608.48 --> 4609.82]  doing drills down in Arizona,
[4610.02 --> 4610.68]  all the type of stuff.
[4610.92 --> 4613.88]  So, Tarkov's customization level
[4613.88 --> 4615.80]  with firearms is completely...
[4616.48 --> 4617.52]  A feature for him,
[4617.74 --> 4618.50]  a bug for me.
[4618.62 --> 4618.86]  Yeah.
[4619.14 --> 4619.80]  It's completely,
[4620.52 --> 4621.86]  unquestionably unmatched.
[4622.36 --> 4624.74]  Like, it's absolutely wild,
[4625.00 --> 4625.96]  the degree that they went to.
[4626.14 --> 4627.44]  All these different systems
[4627.44 --> 4628.30]  that they have in the game,
[4628.56 --> 4629.48]  the medical systems
[4629.48 --> 4631.04]  are really just amazing.
[4631.56 --> 4632.38]  There's all these
[4632.38 --> 4633.56]  different components of the game.
[4633.58 --> 4634.34]  The fact you can get, like,
[4634.56 --> 4636.52]  hit in a particular spot
[4636.52 --> 4637.44]  and have to use
[4637.44 --> 4639.32]  a particular kind of first aid,
[4639.44 --> 4640.36]  like...
[4640.36 --> 4641.18]  Yeah, like, you can have...
[4641.18 --> 4642.62]  There's different types of bleeds
[4642.62 --> 4643.96]  and you need different types.
[4644.08 --> 4645.40]  You need a certain type of bandage
[4645.40 --> 4646.30]  for, like, a light bleed.
[4646.48 --> 4649.06]  You need things like a cat
[4649.06 --> 4650.00]  for a heavy bleed,
[4650.08 --> 4650.70]  something like that.
[4650.76 --> 4651.48]  Like, there's all these...
[4652.00 --> 4653.04]  It's a...
[4653.04 --> 4655.16]  The game has an insane amount of depth.
[4655.62 --> 4657.04]  I've played EVE online
[4657.04 --> 4658.62]  and the depth in Tarkov
[4658.62 --> 4659.58]  feels like it, like,
[4659.90 --> 4661.04]  competes with it really heavily.
[4661.10 --> 4663.30]  And yet, it still has that action,
[4663.48 --> 4664.44]  that shooter action.
[4664.76 --> 4664.88]  Yeah.
[4665.12 --> 4666.76]  There's really, really intense moments.
[4666.76 --> 4667.36]  Like, there's...
[4667.36 --> 4667.90]  It's really...
[4667.90 --> 4669.04]  It feels extremely unique.
[4669.20 --> 4669.92]  There's a few games
[4669.92 --> 4670.78]  that have tried to come out
[4670.78 --> 4673.06]  and be Escape from Tarkov,
[4673.14 --> 4674.24]  but, like, more for normies.
[4674.74 --> 4675.38]  But then it's not
[4675.38 --> 4676.34]  Escape from Tarkov anymore.
[4676.36 --> 4677.22]  It never really works out.
[4677.22 --> 4677.76]  Like, honestly,
[4677.86 --> 4678.44]  even as someone
[4678.44 --> 4680.34]  who is a relative normie,
[4680.92 --> 4682.64]  I enjoy Tarkov
[4682.64 --> 4683.62]  more than I'm sure
[4683.62 --> 4685.00]  I would enjoy something
[4685.00 --> 4686.68]  that's trying to be Tarkov
[4686.68 --> 4688.74]  because it's...
[4688.74 --> 4689.72]  I don't know.
[4689.74 --> 4690.40]  You're just kind of along
[4690.40 --> 4690.94]  for the ride.
[4691.04 --> 4691.68]  I mean, part of it is
[4691.68 --> 4692.82]  I'm playing with these guys, right?
[4692.90 --> 4694.46]  So, I'm just like...
[4694.46 --> 4697.74]  I'm gonna have a big backpack on
[4697.74 --> 4699.46]  and I'm gonna put a backpack in it
[4699.46 --> 4700.24]  and then I'm gonna put
[4700.24 --> 4701.20]  a backpack in that.
[4702.82 --> 4704.12]  It's fun running around with lions.
[4704.18 --> 4705.52]  Russian nesting backpacks.
[4708.30 --> 4709.86]  But, like,
[4710.04 --> 4711.22]  this most recent wipe,
[4711.22 --> 4712.30]  and it's always fun
[4712.30 --> 4713.60]  near the beginning of a wipe
[4713.60 --> 4715.54]  because no one has cool gear.
[4715.94 --> 4717.18]  Like, as a...
[4717.18 --> 4717.74]  So, okay.
[4717.94 --> 4718.54]  The game wipes
[4718.54 --> 4719.16]  every once in a while.
[4719.26 --> 4719.96]  Your character loses
[4719.96 --> 4722.14]  all of their custom stats
[4722.14 --> 4723.44]  and you have a stash
[4723.44 --> 4724.32]  where you can store
[4724.32 --> 4724.76]  all these, like,
[4724.78 --> 4725.32]  different firearms,
[4725.46 --> 4725.88]  body armors,
[4725.98 --> 4726.48]  medical supplies,
[4726.60 --> 4727.12]  money, whatever.
[4727.98 --> 4728.66]  Every once in a while
[4728.66 --> 4729.14]  there's a wipe.
[4729.22 --> 4730.32]  You lose all that stuff.
[4730.38 --> 4731.46]  Your character fully resets.
[4732.24 --> 4733.56]  Wipes are actually really fun.
[4734.08 --> 4734.74]  I know a lot of people
[4734.74 --> 4735.26]  are gonna think, like,
[4735.28 --> 4736.24]  oh, you lost all your progress.
[4736.56 --> 4737.68]  Yeah, but now everyone
[4737.68 --> 4739.52]  is on the same playing field
[4739.52 --> 4740.30]  and you're playing
[4740.30 --> 4740.76]  with these, like,
[4740.86 --> 4741.54]  janky guns
[4741.54 --> 4742.86]  so the recoil and stuff
[4742.86 --> 4743.30]  is horrible.
[4743.50 --> 4743.84]  You're gonna, like,
[4743.86 --> 4744.40]  run up to someone
[4744.40 --> 4745.14]  and they're gonna have, like,
[4745.36 --> 4746.84]  an AK-74
[4746.84 --> 4748.28]  that, like,
[4748.32 --> 4749.54]  doesn't even have a buttstock
[4749.54 --> 4750.66]  so they try to fire it
[4750.66 --> 4751.10]  and it's just gonna, like,
[4751.12 --> 4752.28]  fly all over the place
[4752.28 --> 4753.60]  and it's just very interesting.
[4754.84 --> 4755.16]  But,
[4755.34 --> 4756.46]  this wipe comes around.
[4756.62 --> 4757.28]  The beginning of it
[4757.28 --> 4758.06]  is really fun.
[4758.20 --> 4759.16]  Having a ton of fun with it.
[4759.44 --> 4760.02]  And then they
[4760.02 --> 4761.50]  patched some things
[4761.50 --> 4762.60]  that made the game better
[4762.60 --> 4763.96]  but those patches
[4763.96 --> 4764.70]  introduced
[4764.70 --> 4766.60]  randomly invisible players.
[4767.98 --> 4768.82]  Kind of an issue.
[4769.10 --> 4770.20]  Not only are they invisible
[4770.20 --> 4772.68]  but nothing that they do
[4772.68 --> 4773.88]  registers on your side.
[4774.58 --> 4775.28]  So if they, like,
[4775.34 --> 4776.14]  throw an item on the ground
[4776.14 --> 4776.96]  it's invisible to you.
[4777.06 --> 4778.26]  If they make any amount of noise
[4778.26 --> 4779.08]  you can't hear it.
[4779.36 --> 4781.54]  If you know 100%
[4781.54 --> 4782.30]  where they are
[4782.30 --> 4783.30]  and you shoot them
[4783.30 --> 4784.30]  nothing will happen.
[4784.38 --> 4785.06]  They take no damage.
[4786.16 --> 4786.52]  They, like,
[4786.76 --> 4787.82]  and they can see you,
[4787.88 --> 4788.58]  they can interact with you,
[4788.62 --> 4789.14]  they can kill you,
[4789.18 --> 4789.94]  they can take all your stuff.
[4790.60 --> 4792.02]  Really, really frustrating.
[4792.02 --> 4793.16]  At the same time
[4793.16 --> 4794.24]  as that's going on
[4794.24 --> 4797.00]  Google it.
[4797.08 --> 4797.68]  It's AK-74.
[4798.68 --> 4799.98]  At the same time
[4799.98 --> 4801.50]  as that kind of stuff's going on
[4801.50 --> 4804.22]  sound is, like,
[4804.32 --> 4805.28]  super messed up.
[4805.44 --> 4806.56]  Completely messed up.
[4806.62 --> 4807.88]  There's no real functioning
[4807.88 --> 4808.74]  vertical audio.
[4809.24 --> 4810.36]  Sounds are just coming in
[4810.36 --> 4812.72]  completely random directions.
[4812.72 --> 4813.14]  Like,
[4813.34 --> 4814.60]  I'll watch someone
[4814.60 --> 4816.22]  walk, like,
[4816.38 --> 4817.02]  left to right
[4817.02 --> 4818.12]  in front of my screen
[4818.12 --> 4819.38]  and hear them, like,
[4819.52 --> 4820.26]  back there
[4820.26 --> 4821.34]  and it sounds like
[4821.34 --> 4821.80]  they're upstairs.
[4822.02 --> 4822.56]  Like, it just,
[4822.88 --> 4824.16]  nothing makes
[4824.16 --> 4825.70]  any sense with audio.
[4826.58 --> 4827.50]  Crazy lag
[4827.50 --> 4828.44]  all over the place.
[4829.28 --> 4830.06]  Everything is just
[4830.06 --> 4830.72]  super wacky.
[4830.88 --> 4832.12]  So you have invisible players,
[4832.98 --> 4833.58]  which people
[4833.58 --> 4834.86]  eventually figure out
[4834.86 --> 4836.12]  how to intentionally do
[4836.12 --> 4837.08]  so they can make
[4837.08 --> 4838.04]  themselves invisible.
[4838.86 --> 4839.74]  And it happens
[4839.74 --> 4840.66]  to people at random.
[4841.16 --> 4842.18]  And you have audio
[4842.18 --> 4843.30]  coming from all over the place.
[4843.70 --> 4844.52]  And cheating
[4844.52 --> 4845.72]  is
[4845.72 --> 4847.00]  a genuine
[4847.00 --> 4848.04]  major problem
[4848.04 --> 4849.36]  in every
[4849.36 --> 4850.26]  single
[4850.26 --> 4851.44]  multiplayer game
[4851.44 --> 4851.98]  that exists.
[4852.36 --> 4852.60]  Yeah.
[4852.94 --> 4853.62]  So you were saying
[4853.62 --> 4854.04]  there's, like,
[4854.06 --> 4855.38]  a big Tarkov creator
[4855.38 --> 4855.92]  that,
[4856.08 --> 4856.82]  what, like,
[4856.92 --> 4857.26]  cheated
[4857.26 --> 4858.74]  to find cheaters
[4858.74 --> 4859.58]  or something like that?
[4859.64 --> 4859.76]  Like,
[4859.80 --> 4860.70]  cheated for science?
[4860.86 --> 4861.50]  That is
[4861.50 --> 4862.70]  not public yet
[4862.70 --> 4863.24]  because that video
[4863.24 --> 4863.72]  is not out.
[4868.72 --> 4869.20]  Cool.
[4869.60 --> 4870.28]  And I mean,
[4870.32 --> 4870.66]  no offense,
[4870.74 --> 4871.10]  but they're not
[4871.10 --> 4872.48]  that big of a Tarkov creator.
[4872.60 --> 4873.24]  But they're cool.
[4873.66 --> 4874.44]  They make cool stuff.
[4875.22 --> 4875.74]  They're growing.
[4875.92 --> 4876.46]  They'll get there.
[4876.58 --> 4877.26]  I believe in you.
[4878.00 --> 4878.30]  I mean,
[4878.36 --> 4879.18]  should we just promote them
[4879.18 --> 4879.74]  at this point?
[4879.88 --> 4880.22]  Sure.
[4880.50 --> 4880.68]  Yeah,
[4880.76 --> 4881.72]  it's Goat Moth.
[4881.88 --> 4883.20]  He's going to be making a video
[4883.20 --> 4884.94]  which we kind of just ruined.
[4885.26 --> 4885.88]  I'm sorry.
[4885.98 --> 4886.44]  I apologize.
[4886.52 --> 4886.62]  Well,
[4886.62 --> 4887.16]  we didn't ruin it.
[4887.16 --> 4887.90]  We hyped it.
[4888.00 --> 4889.04]  It's genuinely
[4889.04 --> 4890.48]  fascinating.
[4890.86 --> 4891.74]  It's wild
[4891.74 --> 4892.84]  because he does this whole thing.
[4892.90 --> 4893.06]  Wow,
[4893.08 --> 4894.32]  I'm just going to completely ruin it.
[4894.38 --> 4895.04]  I'm sorry, bro.
[4897.32 --> 4898.26]  I'm going to go into it.
[4898.36 --> 4898.76]  Okay, guys,
[4898.82 --> 4899.92]  just go subscribe
[4899.92 --> 4900.66]  to help
[4900.66 --> 4902.86]  make it up to him.
[4903.06 --> 4904.72]  The O in Goat is a zero.
[4904.90 --> 4905.66]  Go find him.
[4906.66 --> 4907.18]  So he,
[4907.42 --> 4908.20]  oh, man.
[4908.42 --> 4908.78]  Wow.
[4909.58 --> 4910.88]  I hope he's okay with this.
[4910.90 --> 4911.74]  I'm just going to send it.
[4912.56 --> 4913.78]  The worst that can happen
[4913.78 --> 4915.48]  is he can never talk to you again
[4915.48 --> 4918.58]  and tell everyone he knows
[4918.58 --> 4920.20]  about what an utter piece
[4920.20 --> 4921.48]  of untrustworthy
[4921.48 --> 4922.18]  you are.
[4922.54 --> 4922.58]  Yeah.
[4923.30 --> 4923.86]  No, for sure.
[4923.92 --> 4924.70]  It's not that bad.
[4924.74 --> 4925.22]  I've had worse.
[4927.44 --> 4928.64]  It's deeply fascinating.
[4928.64 --> 4929.56]  He showed me
[4929.56 --> 4931.24]  a bunch of clips
[4931.24 --> 4932.24]  where
[4932.24 --> 4934.80]  and you have to go watch it
[4934.80 --> 4935.76]  because the feeling
[4935.76 --> 4936.52]  that you get from it
[4936.52 --> 4937.70]  is actually really interesting
[4937.70 --> 4938.54]  and it might only happen
[4938.54 --> 4939.54]  to people that have played Tarkov
[4939.54 --> 4940.06]  but I think you should
[4940.06 --> 4940.72]  watch it anyways
[4940.72 --> 4941.98]  because
[4941.98 --> 4943.62]  like I said,
[4943.74 --> 4945.28]  cheating in every single game
[4945.28 --> 4947.20]  if it has multiplayer
[4947.20 --> 4948.26]  is rampant
[4948.26 --> 4949.44]  to be completely honest.
[4949.58 --> 4950.74]  It's genuinely rampant.
[4950.98 --> 4951.08]  Yep.
[4951.78 --> 4953.60]  Cheats are so sophisticated now.
[4953.76 --> 4954.32]  Joe just linked.
[4954.38 --> 4954.92]  Is it public?
[4954.92 --> 4959.66]  Oh, this is from two months ago.
[4959.76 --> 4960.68]  Yeah, he made that video
[4960.68 --> 4961.42]  two months ago.
[4963.06 --> 4965.06]  But yeah, cheating in games
[4965.06 --> 4965.68]  is rampant.
[4966.08 --> 4967.56]  You see people get caught
[4967.56 --> 4968.72]  that are streamers
[4968.72 --> 4969.54]  for cheating
[4969.54 --> 4971.42]  like consistently.
[4971.78 --> 4972.94]  It's happening all the time.
[4973.18 --> 4973.96]  We've had people
[4973.96 --> 4976.50]  get pulled out of live events,
[4976.78 --> 4977.78]  professional players
[4977.78 --> 4979.06]  on professional teams
[4979.06 --> 4980.26]  getting caught live
[4980.26 --> 4981.38]  because they loaded stuff
[4981.38 --> 4982.64]  onto their mouse
[4982.64 --> 4983.76]  that when their mouse
[4983.76 --> 4984.58]  was plugged in the computer
[4984.58 --> 4985.30]  it would inject
[4985.30 --> 4986.20]  and then give them
[4986.20 --> 4987.50]  whatever advantage.
[4988.02 --> 4989.18]  Like there's cheaters
[4989.18 --> 4989.98]  at every level
[4989.98 --> 4990.90]  and there's tons of them.
[4991.14 --> 4993.32]  The problem with Tarkov
[4993.32 --> 4995.94]  is there's very little
[4995.94 --> 4997.10]  being done to stop them.
[4997.52 --> 4997.62]  Right.
[4997.76 --> 4998.56]  Very little.
[4998.94 --> 4999.92]  There's no way to
[4999.92 --> 5001.92]  watch a replay of the match
[5001.92 --> 5002.88]  after the match is over.
[5003.52 --> 5004.88]  And whenever I mention that
[5004.88 --> 5005.52]  people are like,
[5005.62 --> 5007.84]  oh, it's a...
[5007.84 --> 5009.08]  I don't want kill cams
[5009.08 --> 5009.34]  in Tarkov.
[5009.40 --> 5010.52]  I'm not asking for a kill cam.
[5010.74 --> 5011.92]  I do not want there
[5011.92 --> 5013.00]  to be additional information
[5013.00 --> 5013.72]  that I could give
[5013.72 --> 5014.30]  to other people
[5014.30 --> 5014.80]  that are currently
[5014.80 --> 5015.40]  playing the game.
[5015.64 --> 5016.66]  But once that match
[5016.66 --> 5017.76]  is fully complete,
[5018.24 --> 5019.76]  it would be good
[5019.76 --> 5020.78]  if I could watch it back
[5020.78 --> 5023.02]  because Tarkov
[5023.02 --> 5024.22]  has horrible servers.
[5024.36 --> 5025.34]  It has horrible desync.
[5025.40 --> 5026.96]  It has horrible tick rate.
[5027.04 --> 5027.74]  All this type of stuff.
[5027.92 --> 5028.96]  So it's really hard to tell
[5028.96 --> 5031.00]  if someone is aimbotting you
[5031.00 --> 5032.04]  or if there's crazy desync
[5032.04 --> 5032.94]  and you just haven't seen them
[5032.94 --> 5033.84]  come around the corner yet
[5033.84 --> 5034.58]  or whatever else.
[5035.44 --> 5036.80]  So people have known
[5036.80 --> 5037.60]  that there's tons of cheaters
[5037.60 --> 5038.50]  in Tarkov forever.
[5038.86 --> 5039.68]  There's a bunch of ways
[5039.68 --> 5040.62]  to be able to know that,
[5040.88 --> 5041.68]  but people have known
[5041.68 --> 5042.32]  for a long time.
[5042.54 --> 5044.26]  But the degree of which
[5044.26 --> 5045.82]  has been hard to tell.
[5046.32 --> 5047.38]  There's a type of cheating
[5047.38 --> 5048.56]  that people have known about
[5048.56 --> 5049.82]  which people call ESP,
[5050.44 --> 5051.80]  which is essentially wall hacks.
[5052.26 --> 5052.56]  Right.
[5052.68 --> 5053.98]  You can see through walls, right?
[5056.14 --> 5057.04]  Is it going up?
[5057.26 --> 5057.50]  Oh yeah.
[5057.62 --> 5058.34]  It just went up 300.
[5058.66 --> 5059.18]  There we go.
[5059.26 --> 5059.46]  Good.
[5059.84 --> 5061.06]  There's a type of cheating
[5061.06 --> 5063.34]  in Tarkov called ESP.
[5064.02 --> 5065.58]  Not only can you see through walls,
[5065.76 --> 5067.68]  but next to people's names,
[5067.76 --> 5068.64]  you can see their name,
[5068.64 --> 5069.78]  you can see their KD,
[5070.14 --> 5072.16]  you can see their full inventory,
[5072.50 --> 5073.16]  you can see the things
[5073.16 --> 5073.86]  that they have picked up
[5073.86 --> 5074.72]  in the raid so far.
[5074.94 --> 5075.00]  Wow.
[5075.10 --> 5076.40]  You can see where they're facing.
[5077.20 --> 5077.64]  Everything.
[5078.74 --> 5080.40]  And that is effectively,
[5081.06 --> 5082.20]  for BSG right now,
[5082.36 --> 5083.08]  not detectable.
[5083.96 --> 5085.40]  How is that even possible?
[5085.62 --> 5087.46]  And because there's no replay system,
[5088.04 --> 5089.36]  there's no way to see
[5089.36 --> 5090.24]  people's perspectives
[5090.24 --> 5090.84]  after the match,
[5090.88 --> 5091.74]  there's no kill cam,
[5091.98 --> 5093.56]  there's no Counter-Strike
[5093.56 --> 5094.56]  style Overwatch system,
[5094.76 --> 5095.82]  there is nothing,
[5095.82 --> 5098.46]  if that's the only way
[5098.46 --> 5099.02]  that they're cheating,
[5099.22 --> 5100.38]  they're not actually aimbotting,
[5100.56 --> 5101.54]  they're not flyhacking,
[5101.90 --> 5102.90]  they're not clipping through walls,
[5102.96 --> 5103.12]  whatever.
[5103.34 --> 5104.70]  They just know where you are
[5104.70 --> 5105.22]  all the time.
[5106.50 --> 5107.74]  Which in Tarkov
[5107.74 --> 5109.02]  is everything.
[5109.34 --> 5110.52]  Absolutely obscene level
[5110.52 --> 5111.08]  of advantage.
[5111.30 --> 5111.46]  Yeah.
[5111.60 --> 5112.60]  You're like never going to know.
[5113.70 --> 5114.84]  So what he did
[5114.84 --> 5116.30]  was he wanted to look into
[5116.30 --> 5118.08]  how bad this thing is.
[5118.20 --> 5118.42]  Sure.
[5118.44 --> 5119.10]  And I don't want to spoil
[5119.10 --> 5119.72]  the whole video.
[5120.06 --> 5121.14]  Well, they're all going to watch it.
[5121.46 --> 5121.84]  But yeah,
[5121.84 --> 5123.22]  you do need to watch it.
[5123.36 --> 5124.58]  What he did was
[5124.58 --> 5125.82]  he went out
[5125.82 --> 5127.08]  and did the bad.
[5128.10 --> 5129.60]  He got an ESP.
[5130.20 --> 5130.38]  Right.
[5130.38 --> 5131.04]  Because the only way
[5131.04 --> 5131.80]  to figure it out
[5131.80 --> 5133.38]  is to go do it.
[5133.56 --> 5134.56]  And what he would do,
[5134.62 --> 5135.60]  and I'm not going to tell you how
[5135.60 --> 5136.20]  because you've got to go
[5136.20 --> 5136.78]  watch the video,
[5137.30 --> 5138.54]  but God is publishing
[5138.54 --> 5139.20]  the video now.
[5139.36 --> 5140.12]  That's probably good.
[5142.22 --> 5142.84]  What he would,
[5142.92 --> 5143.30]  okay, I'll,
[5143.46 --> 5144.44]  yeah, I don't want to
[5144.44 --> 5145.00]  spoil it too much.
[5145.08 --> 5145.68]  Man, I don't want to
[5145.68 --> 5146.02]  screw him over.
[5146.02 --> 5146.60]  Spoil it a little.
[5146.72 --> 5147.12]  It's fine.
[5147.22 --> 5147.56]  It's fine.
[5147.86 --> 5149.22]  He would test people.
[5150.10 --> 5150.70]  So he,
[5150.70 --> 5152.72]  he brought on like
[5152.72 --> 5153.46]  a code of rules
[5153.46 --> 5154.40]  because he doesn't want
[5154.40 --> 5155.30]  to spoil the game,
[5155.52 --> 5155.72]  right?
[5155.88 --> 5156.38]  He doesn't want to make
[5156.38 --> 5157.02]  the game worse
[5157.02 --> 5157.88]  for legitimate players.
[5158.04 --> 5159.24]  So he would just
[5159.24 --> 5160.80]  follow people around
[5160.80 --> 5161.80]  that he thought was cheating.
[5162.42 --> 5163.64]  He refused to kill
[5163.64 --> 5164.62]  any actual players
[5164.62 --> 5165.52]  under any circumstance.
[5165.82 --> 5166.94]  So sometimes he'd be
[5166.94 --> 5167.82]  following some around
[5167.82 --> 5169.06]  and an actual legit player
[5169.06 --> 5169.44]  would come up
[5169.44 --> 5169.84]  and kill him.
[5169.94 --> 5170.82]  And it is what it is.
[5170.84 --> 5171.40]  He just has to go
[5171.40 --> 5172.06]  into another match
[5172.06 --> 5172.60]  and figure it out.
[5172.76 --> 5172.88]  Sure.
[5173.14 --> 5173.80]  But he'd follow
[5173.80 --> 5174.66]  these people around
[5174.66 --> 5175.72]  and watching how
[5175.72 --> 5176.38]  they would react
[5176.38 --> 5177.56]  was so interesting.
[5178.40 --> 5179.34]  Took him a little while
[5179.34 --> 5179.88]  to figure it out.
[5179.96 --> 5180.92]  But there's been this thing
[5180.92 --> 5182.40]  in Tarkov for a long time.
[5182.48 --> 5182.66]  Yeah.
[5182.74 --> 5183.32]  Which people call
[5183.32 --> 5183.74]  the wiggle.
[5184.86 --> 5185.42]  It's where you're,
[5185.54 --> 5186.18]  you look at someone
[5186.18 --> 5187.34]  and you just lean,
[5187.54 --> 5188.22]  lean peek left,
[5188.32 --> 5188.84]  lean peek right
[5188.84 --> 5189.38]  and do it over
[5189.38 --> 5189.76]  and over again.
[5189.80 --> 5190.16]  So your character
[5190.16 --> 5190.72]  just goes like.
[5192.20 --> 5192.56]  Yeah.
[5192.72 --> 5193.38]  What does it mean?
[5193.42 --> 5194.52]  Like friendly or like.
[5194.68 --> 5195.56]  Back in the day,
[5195.56 --> 5197.02]  if it was two
[5197.02 --> 5197.96]  non-cheating players
[5197.96 --> 5198.68]  that saw each other,
[5198.74 --> 5199.94]  it was a way to indicate,
[5200.06 --> 5201.10]  yo, like I'm cool.
[5201.42 --> 5202.04]  We're friendly.
[5203.26 --> 5204.14]  They've added VoIP
[5204.14 --> 5204.72]  to the game now
[5204.72 --> 5205.20]  so you can talk
[5205.20 --> 5205.70]  to each other.
[5206.70 --> 5207.34]  That's not really
[5207.34 --> 5208.02]  necessary anymore.
[5208.50 --> 5209.38]  So the JIT players
[5209.38 --> 5210.34]  don't really wiggle anymore.
[5210.92 --> 5212.64]  But if you can see
[5212.64 --> 5213.50]  the other person
[5213.50 --> 5215.50]  at 600 meters
[5215.50 --> 5217.00]  through three buildings
[5217.00 --> 5217.56]  in a mountain
[5217.56 --> 5218.96]  because you're wall hacking
[5218.96 --> 5220.32]  and they wiggle at you
[5220.32 --> 5221.34]  and they're staring
[5221.34 --> 5222.08]  right at you,
[5223.02 --> 5223.34]  well,
[5223.72 --> 5224.96]  you can wiggle back.
[5226.80 --> 5228.64]  So cheaters are using it.
[5228.76 --> 5229.64]  So he figured out
[5229.64 --> 5231.70]  that people were doing this
[5231.70 --> 5233.44]  as a sign of like,
[5233.50 --> 5235.02]  yo, I'm also a cheater
[5235.02 --> 5235.88]  and friendly
[5235.88 --> 5237.76]  because there's no possible way
[5237.76 --> 5238.56]  they could see you.
[5239.08 --> 5239.60]  Right.
[5239.60 --> 5240.76]  So he would just go
[5240.76 --> 5242.18]  harass people.
[5243.08 --> 5244.52]  And he would,
[5244.56 --> 5244.88]  so like,
[5245.10 --> 5246.22]  and if you were a normal player,
[5246.28 --> 5246.92]  you'd have no idea
[5246.92 --> 5247.72]  that he was there, right?
[5247.74 --> 5248.66]  So he's not actually
[5248.66 --> 5250.54]  bothering any normal players.
[5250.54 --> 5250.80]  Right.
[5251.04 --> 5252.26]  Because there's a lot of stuff
[5252.26 --> 5252.54]  that you,
[5252.62 --> 5253.22]  just to be clear,
[5253.32 --> 5254.14]  like it's not like,
[5254.40 --> 5254.86]  for those of you
[5254.86 --> 5256.26]  who don't play Tarkov,
[5256.46 --> 5257.16]  which by the way,
[5257.18 --> 5257.90]  I totally understand.
[5259.00 --> 5260.22]  It's pretty intense.
[5260.42 --> 5260.68]  It's fair.
[5260.68 --> 5261.02]  Um,
[5261.10 --> 5262.24]  there's lots of things
[5262.24 --> 5263.22]  that you can do
[5263.22 --> 5264.04]  in a lobby
[5264.04 --> 5265.92]  that are not just PvP.
[5266.44 --> 5266.68]  Yeah.
[5266.74 --> 5267.32]  So there's,
[5267.36 --> 5267.90]  there's like,
[5267.98 --> 5268.60]  kind of like,
[5268.66 --> 5268.98]  uh,
[5268.98 --> 5270.28]  missions that you can complete
[5270.28 --> 5271.42]  and all that kind of stuff.
[5271.54 --> 5273.80]  So just because there are,
[5273.96 --> 5275.46]  there's a wasted slot
[5275.46 --> 5276.08]  in the lobby
[5276.08 --> 5277.60]  doesn't mean all of a sudden
[5277.60 --> 5278.32]  that this,
[5278.40 --> 5279.60]  this instance is now
[5279.60 --> 5280.62]  completely broken
[5280.62 --> 5281.46]  and totally imbalanced.
[5281.46 --> 5281.92]  Not a problem.
[5282.02 --> 5282.80]  He actually probably
[5282.80 --> 5284.28]  was not hurting
[5284.28 --> 5285.32]  the gameplay experience
[5285.32 --> 5286.32]  for the legit players
[5286.32 --> 5287.22]  in the lobby at all.
[5287.22 --> 5288.90]  I seriously doubt that he was.
[5289.02 --> 5289.62]  And like,
[5289.66 --> 5290.34]  there's legit players
[5290.34 --> 5290.86]  that killed him.
[5290.98 --> 5291.46]  It's also,
[5292.20 --> 5293.26]  when he was showing me
[5293.26 --> 5294.00]  some of these clips,
[5294.22 --> 5294.94]  it was,
[5295.06 --> 5296.90]  it was soul wrenching
[5296.90 --> 5298.78]  because he would follow
[5298.78 --> 5299.70]  these guys around
[5299.70 --> 5300.76]  for like a long time
[5300.76 --> 5302.02]  and you're convinced inside.
[5302.08 --> 5302.26]  You're like,
[5302.30 --> 5302.46]  nope,
[5302.46 --> 5303.28]  these guys are legit.
[5303.52 --> 5304.94]  Like they haven't looked at them.
[5305.10 --> 5306.40]  They haven't wiggled back.
[5306.64 --> 5307.80]  They haven't done anything.
[5308.04 --> 5308.44]  Like,
[5308.98 --> 5309.28]  good,
[5309.54 --> 5309.78]  good.
[5309.96 --> 5310.14]  Yeah.
[5310.46 --> 5312.36]  And then he's still following them.
[5312.42 --> 5313.20]  He's still following them.
[5313.22 --> 5313.98]  He just doesn't give up,
[5314.04 --> 5314.50]  doesn't give up,
[5314.56 --> 5315.06]  doesn't give up.
[5315.14 --> 5316.02]  And then one of them
[5316.02 --> 5316.58]  will look over
[5316.58 --> 5318.46]  and through multiple walls,
[5318.56 --> 5318.66]  just,
[5318.88 --> 5321.32]  and the second you see them
[5321.32 --> 5322.34]  start leaning back and forth,
[5322.40 --> 5322.94]  it's just,
[5323.64 --> 5324.50]  it kills you,
[5324.56 --> 5324.74]  man.
[5324.84 --> 5325.90]  And the amount of times
[5325.90 --> 5326.62]  that it happens
[5326.62 --> 5330.44]  is deeply disturbing.
[5330.82 --> 5332.56]  It's like almost every match.
[5332.82 --> 5334.84]  It's also whole teams of players
[5334.84 --> 5336.16]  who run up against
[5336.16 --> 5337.36]  a four stack of players
[5337.36 --> 5337.92]  that are cheating
[5337.92 --> 5340.78]  and confirmed
[5340.78 --> 5343.02]  because it's easy to confirm.
[5343.22 --> 5343.62]  Right.
[5344.18 --> 5345.46]  Because you can't see each other.
[5345.46 --> 5345.62]  And,
[5345.78 --> 5345.90]  oh,
[5345.94 --> 5346.10]  right.
[5346.18 --> 5346.92]  His cheat thing.
[5347.34 --> 5347.60]  Yeah.
[5347.80 --> 5349.50]  If there is no line of sight,
[5349.90 --> 5351.60]  it shows a green box around them.
[5351.72 --> 5353.04]  If there is line of sight,
[5353.12 --> 5354.30]  it shows a red box around them.
[5354.38 --> 5355.78]  So you know
[5355.78 --> 5357.30]  100%
[5357.30 --> 5358.46]  if they can see you or not.
[5359.04 --> 5360.20]  And he'll even do things
[5360.20 --> 5361.44]  like he'll pull his knife out.
[5361.82 --> 5362.22]  Yeah.
[5362.30 --> 5363.70]  And then they'll pull their knife out.
[5364.68 --> 5365.84]  You can't see each other.
[5365.94 --> 5367.16]  You're too far away to hear it.
[5368.32 --> 5369.42]  He'll even have people
[5369.42 --> 5369.82]  that like,
[5369.88 --> 5370.88]  they can't see him
[5370.88 --> 5372.12]  and they'll be like,
[5372.12 --> 5372.26]  oh,
[5372.28 --> 5373.20]  why do you have your knife out?
[5373.68 --> 5374.94]  They can't see him,
[5375.04 --> 5375.26]  bro.
[5376.86 --> 5377.26]  Like,
[5377.34 --> 5378.58]  it's so brutal.
[5379.28 --> 5380.28]  It's so brutal.
[5380.28 --> 5380.40]  That's terrible.
[5381.90 --> 5382.64]  So I,
[5382.64 --> 5383.12]  I like,
[5383.20 --> 5383.98]  I can't,
[5385.86 --> 5388.28]  knowing that there's like
[5388.28 --> 5389.62]  going to be a cheater
[5389.62 --> 5390.58]  in every lobby.
[5390.88 --> 5391.18]  Yeah.
[5391.40 --> 5392.28]  Why would I play this game?
[5392.72 --> 5393.82]  How's that even fun?
[5394.18 --> 5394.44]  Yeah.
[5395.28 --> 5395.68]  And like,
[5395.76 --> 5395.90]  sure,
[5395.96 --> 5396.98]  they're not rage hacking.
[5397.46 --> 5398.20]  Like people's like,
[5398.26 --> 5398.32]  well,
[5398.34 --> 5398.46]  oh,
[5398.48 --> 5399.54]  I get killed by like,
[5400.06 --> 5401.38]  fly hackers in Tarkov
[5401.38 --> 5402.06]  like every match.
[5402.16 --> 5402.26]  No,
[5402.32 --> 5403.02]  I don't believe you.
[5403.16 --> 5403.68]  Like at all.
[5404.64 --> 5406.12]  And after watching Goat
[5406.12 --> 5407.20]  doing this deep dive,
[5407.38 --> 5408.66]  I don't believe you even more
[5408.66 --> 5409.42]  because now I know
[5409.42 --> 5410.12]  what they're all doing.
[5410.70 --> 5411.38]  Almost all of them
[5411.38 --> 5412.60]  are just running these ESP systems.
[5412.62 --> 5413.12]  And so basically,
[5413.36 --> 5414.56]  for someone like you
[5414.56 --> 5415.88]  that is actually respecting
[5415.88 --> 5417.12]  the integrity of the game,
[5417.20 --> 5417.70]  which is a very,
[5417.70 --> 5419.74]  it's a very sim-like game.
[5420.00 --> 5420.12]  You know,
[5420.14 --> 5420.40]  there's,
[5420.46 --> 5421.08]  there's no,
[5421.26 --> 5422.40]  you know,
[5422.42 --> 5423.92]  there's no Halo style
[5423.92 --> 5424.78]  radar
[5424.78 --> 5426.68]  where if people are around you
[5426.68 --> 5427.14]  and moving,
[5427.26 --> 5428.08]  you just have a dot
[5428.08 --> 5429.24]  that shows you where they are
[5429.24 --> 5429.90]  or whatever else.
[5429.90 --> 5431.14]  Like you actually rely
[5431.14 --> 5432.00]  on visual comfort.
[5432.06 --> 5432.98]  There's no outlines
[5432.98 --> 5434.38]  showing whether people
[5434.38 --> 5434.94]  are friendly
[5434.94 --> 5435.84]  or an enemy.
[5435.84 --> 5437.26]  And there's camouflage too
[5437.26 --> 5438.00]  and that's a huge part
[5438.00 --> 5438.44]  of the game.
[5438.78 --> 5439.04]  Yeah,
[5439.08 --> 5439.56]  like camouflage
[5439.56 --> 5441.22]  actually serves a purpose.
[5441.22 --> 5442.52]  Like it's very sim-like.
[5442.96 --> 5444.16]  And so what you're
[5444.16 --> 5445.50]  essentially realizing
[5445.50 --> 5446.58]  is that
[5446.58 --> 5448.68]  nobody is actually
[5448.68 --> 5449.82]  playing Tarkov.
[5450.26 --> 5450.38]  Yeah.
[5450.48 --> 5451.82]  People are just playing
[5451.82 --> 5453.22]  run around
[5453.22 --> 5454.82]  and dunk on people
[5454.82 --> 5455.42]  who are trying
[5455.42 --> 5456.62]  to actually play Tarkov.
[5456.86 --> 5457.32]  And like,
[5457.42 --> 5457.66]  that's,
[5457.78 --> 5458.96]  that was one of the weird things
[5458.96 --> 5459.72]  about him showing me
[5459.72 --> 5460.40]  a bunch of this footage
[5460.40 --> 5460.86]  as well
[5460.86 --> 5461.64]  is like,
[5461.98 --> 5463.62]  he'd run and hide
[5463.62 --> 5464.28]  in some bush
[5464.28 --> 5465.76]  and a player
[5465.76 --> 5466.98]  would just cruise
[5466.98 --> 5467.94]  right on by.
[5468.52 --> 5470.00]  And instead of being like,
[5470.18 --> 5470.42]  yeah,
[5470.42 --> 5471.38]  you're playing Tarkov,
[5471.48 --> 5472.16]  you hit effectively
[5472.16 --> 5472.90]  and he ran by.
[5473.08 --> 5474.04]  I'm now like,
[5474.10 --> 5474.38]  oh,
[5474.46 --> 5474.78]  like,
[5474.96 --> 5476.40]  what a cool dude.
[5477.28 --> 5478.66]  He's playing the game legit.
[5478.86 --> 5480.10]  I'm like proud of this guy
[5480.10 --> 5481.92]  who's not killing Goat right now
[5481.92 --> 5482.32]  because,
[5482.72 --> 5483.66]  not because he's not killing him
[5483.66 --> 5484.96]  but because he's not cheating
[5484.96 --> 5485.52]  so he didn't know
[5485.52 --> 5486.12]  that he was there.
[5488.12 --> 5489.18]  Apparently the video's,
[5489.28 --> 5490.36]  the video's live now
[5490.36 --> 5491.34]  so you can go check it out.
[5492.02 --> 5492.72]  I think he was planning
[5492.72 --> 5493.76]  on releasing it tomorrow
[5493.76 --> 5495.06]  and all this stuff
[5495.06 --> 5496.30]  and I just ruined everything
[5496.30 --> 5497.18]  but whatever,
[5497.34 --> 5498.26]  it's probably for the better.
[5498.92 --> 5499.56]  My bad,
[5499.62 --> 5500.24]  you can hate me later.
[5501.96 --> 5502.58]  But yeah,
[5502.70 --> 5502.76]  I,
[5502.90 --> 5503.34]  that,
[5503.72 --> 5504.10]  that,
[5505.10 --> 5505.98]  I don't know,
[5506.04 --> 5506.86]  it soul crushed me.
[5506.86 --> 5507.40]  Because I,
[5507.40 --> 5508.82]  I always had this like assumption
[5508.82 --> 5511.72]  because every once in a while
[5511.72 --> 5512.58]  someone would get you
[5512.58 --> 5513.20]  and it's just like,
[5513.34 --> 5513.70]  man,
[5513.96 --> 5514.62]  like really?
[5514.86 --> 5516.54]  How did they possibly know
[5516.54 --> 5517.02]  I was there?
[5517.12 --> 5518.36]  It didn't feel like an aim bot.
[5518.44 --> 5519.30]  It didn't feel like anything else
[5519.30 --> 5520.00]  but I was just like,
[5520.08 --> 5520.64]  come on.
[5520.70 --> 5521.02]  Like I,
[5521.26 --> 5523.72]  I was very stealthy.
[5523.82 --> 5524.88]  We have multiple people
[5524.88 --> 5525.56]  on this team.
[5525.88 --> 5526.62]  Like maybe
[5526.62 --> 5528.72]  Joe and I will be flanking
[5528.72 --> 5529.58]  from different angles
[5529.58 --> 5530.96]  and they like perfectly transfer
[5530.96 --> 5532.36]  and it's a really big angle.
[5533.06 --> 5533.24]  Yeah.
[5533.24 --> 5534.00]  All this like weird stuff
[5534.00 --> 5534.48]  where it's just like,
[5534.54 --> 5534.72]  man,
[5534.78 --> 5535.62]  like I just don't
[5535.62 --> 5537.66]  really believe that
[5537.66 --> 5538.38]  and now it's like,
[5538.50 --> 5538.64]  well,
[5538.76 --> 5539.80]  like it doesn't even have
[5539.80 --> 5540.38]  a kill feed,
[5541.16 --> 5541.72]  for example.
[5542.18 --> 5542.88]  Which is good,
[5543.04 --> 5543.42]  technically.
[5543.60 --> 5543.72]  Yeah,
[5543.78 --> 5544.10]  which is,
[5544.20 --> 5544.60]  which is,
[5544.70 --> 5545.48]  which is true
[5545.48 --> 5546.94]  to its sim nature.
[5547.08 --> 5548.20]  You actually have to,
[5548.58 --> 5550.22]  you actually have to see
[5550.22 --> 5551.96]  the opponent drop
[5551.96 --> 5552.92]  and you have to,
[5552.98 --> 5553.88]  not just see them drop,
[5553.94 --> 5554.94]  you have to see them not
[5554.94 --> 5556.40]  be picked up.
[5557.20 --> 5557.92]  Unless you're cheating
[5557.92 --> 5558.84]  because then it tells you
[5558.84 --> 5559.22]  they're dead.
[5559.58 --> 5559.68]  Yeah.
[5559.68 --> 5560.44]  And it can be hard
[5560.44 --> 5561.50]  to keep an eye on them
[5561.50 --> 5562.90]  because you gotta,
[5563.04 --> 5563.22]  maybe,
[5563.30 --> 5564.18]  maybe they've got friends.
[5564.18 --> 5565.74]  You don't know if they have friends
[5565.74 --> 5566.50]  because you can't,
[5566.54 --> 5567.42]  it's not like everyone's
[5567.42 --> 5568.56]  in a party of three
[5568.56 --> 5569.48]  or a party of four.
[5569.60 --> 5570.66]  You can't take that for granted.
[5571.46 --> 5571.78]  It's,
[5571.78 --> 5573.80]  it's a super cool concept
[5573.80 --> 5574.58]  for a game,
[5574.58 --> 5576.40]  but I'm looking at it now
[5576.40 --> 5576.86]  going,
[5576.98 --> 5577.80]  man,
[5578.24 --> 5578.52]  you know,
[5578.52 --> 5579.50]  was every match
[5579.50 --> 5580.50]  that I was ever in
[5580.50 --> 5580.88]  compromised?
[5581.90 --> 5582.34]  Probably.
[5582.82 --> 5584.52]  And he asked me
[5584.52 --> 5585.64]  a really interesting question,
[5585.70 --> 5586.04]  I thought,
[5586.12 --> 5586.72]  which was,
[5586.82 --> 5587.90]  how much cheating
[5587.90 --> 5588.62]  is acceptable?
[5589.76 --> 5590.20]  Right,
[5590.20 --> 5591.32]  because you have to understand
[5591.32 --> 5591.98]  at some level,
[5592.18 --> 5593.16]  there's cheaters
[5593.16 --> 5594.04]  in every game.
[5594.46 --> 5595.16]  There's cheaters
[5595.16 --> 5595.84]  in Warzone.
[5596.78 --> 5596.84]  Yeah.
[5596.96 --> 5597.68]  There was cheaters,
[5597.80 --> 5598.30]  I don't know about
[5598.30 --> 5598.82]  League of Legends,
[5598.94 --> 5600.06]  but I know back in the day,
[5600.48 --> 5600.76]  Dota,
[5601.18 --> 5603.02]  the Warcraft 3 mod Dota,
[5603.24 --> 5603.90]  there was cheaters
[5603.90 --> 5604.40]  in that
[5604.40 --> 5605.68]  because you could remove
[5605.68 --> 5606.56]  the fog of war.
[5607.56 --> 5609.38]  If there's a multiplayer game,
[5609.98 --> 5610.88]  there's going to be
[5610.88 --> 5611.60]  at least someone
[5611.60 --> 5612.14]  who's finding
[5612.14 --> 5613.04]  an unfair advantage.
[5613.40 --> 5613.84]  And,
[5613.98 --> 5615.84]  there is no way
[5615.84 --> 5616.70]  that companies
[5616.70 --> 5617.52]  are going to be able
[5617.52 --> 5618.50]  to defeat this
[5618.50 --> 5621.04]  completely on their own
[5621.04 --> 5622.28]  because,
[5623.06 --> 5624.58]  like,
[5624.66 --> 5625.38]  how are you supposed
[5625.38 --> 5626.24]  to detect someone
[5626.24 --> 5627.54]  taking an external
[5627.54 --> 5628.44]  video camera
[5628.44 --> 5629.34]  that isn't plugged
[5629.34 --> 5630.00]  into the computer
[5630.00 --> 5631.54]  that just looks
[5631.54 --> 5632.22]  at the screen
[5632.22 --> 5634.64]  and performs actions
[5634.64 --> 5636.50]  onto a motorized mouse?
[5636.72 --> 5636.96]  Yeah.
[5637.24 --> 5638.78]  You cannot detect that.
[5639.04 --> 5639.34]  Nope.
[5639.74 --> 5640.64]  Nothing's even connected
[5640.64 --> 5641.18]  to the computer.
[5641.74 --> 5641.90]  Yeah.
[5642.10 --> 5643.28]  There's no extra software
[5643.28 --> 5643.64]  running,
[5643.82 --> 5645.16]  it's not reading,
[5645.16 --> 5646.26]  memory that it
[5646.26 --> 5647.12]  wasn't supposed to.
[5647.80 --> 5648.08]  So,
[5648.16 --> 5648.34]  like,
[5648.56 --> 5649.24]  BattleEye
[5649.24 --> 5650.56]  or whatever the heck,
[5650.80 --> 5651.90]  whatever company has
[5651.90 --> 5652.32]  that's supposed
[5652.32 --> 5653.00]  to detect cheaters
[5653.00 --> 5653.80]  is never,
[5653.80 --> 5655.16]  ever going to detect that
[5655.16 --> 5656.36]  and people do
[5656.36 --> 5657.40]  do that type of stuff.
[5657.98 --> 5658.00]  So,
[5658.10 --> 5658.60]  the solution
[5658.60 --> 5659.98]  is to bring back
[5659.98 --> 5661.18]  the physical LAN party.
[5662.42 --> 5662.84]  But,
[5662.98 --> 5663.30]  okay,
[5663.44 --> 5664.04]  so that actually
[5664.04 --> 5664.76]  helps a ton.
[5664.88 --> 5665.56]  That helps a ton.
[5665.64 --> 5665.74]  But,
[5665.88 --> 5666.36]  like I mentioned,
[5666.42 --> 5666.98]  there's still people
[5666.98 --> 5667.52]  that cheat on LAN.
[5667.52 --> 5667.70]  Sure.
[5667.88 --> 5668.42]  And then when you
[5668.42 --> 5669.02]  catch them,
[5669.46 --> 5670.72]  you shame them
[5670.72 --> 5671.66]  and they never
[5671.66 --> 5672.30]  get to come again.
[5672.40 --> 5672.82]  They're banned
[5672.82 --> 5674.28]  from every game.
[5674.52 --> 5674.66]  Yeah.
[5674.66 --> 5676.12]  Now they can't
[5676.12 --> 5676.66]  play anymore.
[5676.88 --> 5677.06]  Yeah.
[5677.18 --> 5677.92]  I think the stakes
[5677.92 --> 5678.84]  are a lot higher.
[5679.00 --> 5679.72]  They definitely are.
[5679.78 --> 5680.06]  In person.
[5680.28 --> 5681.20]  I seriously doubt
[5681.20 --> 5681.60]  there's,
[5682.10 --> 5682.64]  like,
[5682.70 --> 5683.84]  there's no possible way
[5683.84 --> 5684.66]  there's as many people
[5684.66 --> 5685.32]  cheating on LAN.
[5685.70 --> 5685.88]  But,
[5685.96 --> 5686.12]  like,
[5686.52 --> 5687.40]  it's an interesting
[5687.40 --> 5687.84]  question,
[5687.94 --> 5688.10]  right?
[5688.48 --> 5689.32]  And it kind of
[5689.32 --> 5690.20]  comes down to
[5690.20 --> 5691.82]  the reason why Tarkov
[5691.82 --> 5692.68]  is currently ruined
[5692.68 --> 5693.20]  for me
[5693.20 --> 5694.60]  is because
[5694.60 --> 5695.60]  I am now
[5695.60 --> 5696.70]  deeply questioning
[5696.70 --> 5698.36]  every single engagement
[5698.36 --> 5699.32]  I ever have.
[5699.54 --> 5700.16]  Win or lose,
[5700.76 --> 5702.14]  doesn't matter.
[5702.14 --> 5702.58]  Yeah.
[5702.70 --> 5703.24]  And that's,
[5703.32 --> 5704.20]  that's not,
[5704.30 --> 5704.90]  that's not fun.
[5705.02 --> 5705.12]  No.
[5705.22 --> 5705.90]  It's kind of like,
[5705.98 --> 5706.26]  oh,
[5706.34 --> 5706.60]  okay,
[5706.72 --> 5708.02]  you know what I find
[5708.02 --> 5709.06]  really not enjoyable
[5709.06 --> 5709.92]  is,
[5710.06 --> 5710.38]  like,
[5710.44 --> 5711.60]  you know that I play
[5711.60 --> 5712.04]  badminton,
[5712.16 --> 5712.96]  I get pretty competitive.
[5713.26 --> 5713.38]  Well,
[5713.38 --> 5714.02]  I get pretty competitive
[5714.02 --> 5714.78]  about anything.
[5715.02 --> 5715.18]  Yep.
[5715.24 --> 5716.40]  And I'm really passionate
[5716.40 --> 5716.96]  about badminton.
[5717.08 --> 5717.54]  I love it.
[5717.66 --> 5718.68]  I really enjoy it.
[5720.16 --> 5720.28]  I,
[5720.36 --> 5720.60]  I,
[5720.60 --> 5720.90]  I,
[5721.28 --> 5722.12]  as someone who's always
[5722.12 --> 5722.90]  trying to improve,
[5722.98 --> 5723.76]  I love playing with
[5723.76 --> 5724.58]  higher level players
[5724.58 --> 5725.32]  because they,
[5725.38 --> 5726.28]  they push me to my limit,
[5726.36 --> 5726.56]  right?
[5727.28 --> 5728.18]  But one of the things
[5728.18 --> 5729.38]  that I don't enjoy
[5729.38 --> 5731.24]  is playing outside
[5731.24 --> 5732.20]  of a competitive setting.
[5732.32 --> 5734.04]  I love playing ladder nights.
[5734.44 --> 5735.92]  I love playing anything
[5735.92 --> 5736.44]  where,
[5736.58 --> 5737.54]  where the,
[5737.54 --> 5738.38]  the match matters
[5738.38 --> 5739.32]  and the more it matters,
[5739.32 --> 5739.74]  the better.
[5739.86 --> 5741.68]  So my favorite format to play
[5741.68 --> 5743.04]  is like a point differential
[5743.04 --> 5744.12]  format
[5744.12 --> 5747.06]  where every point matters
[5747.06 --> 5748.92]  because it's like a team format
[5748.92 --> 5750.54]  and the,
[5750.66 --> 5751.92]  the winning team
[5751.92 --> 5752.52]  is determined
[5752.52 --> 5753.98]  by the total point difference
[5753.98 --> 5754.60]  in your matches.
[5754.76 --> 5755.18]  I like that.
[5755.18 --> 5756.18]  So I always,
[5756.36 --> 5758.64]  so the more everyone's fighting
[5758.64 --> 5759.64]  for every point,
[5759.64 --> 5762.92]  the more I enjoy the experience
[5762.92 --> 5764.06]  because it's not,
[5764.14 --> 5765.88]  I would rather lose narrowly
[5765.88 --> 5767.60]  than win by a big margin.
[5767.68 --> 5767.88]  Totally.
[5767.98 --> 5768.50]  It's kind of my,
[5768.54 --> 5769.54]  my general philosophy.
[5770.22 --> 5773.18]  And I don't enjoy playing
[5773.18 --> 5774.90]  when the other person's not trying,
[5775.54 --> 5775.84]  you know,
[5775.96 --> 5776.22]  when,
[5776.38 --> 5779.08]  like the integrity of competition
[5779.08 --> 5780.12]  matters a lot to me.
[5780.14 --> 5780.76]  And I think you're,
[5780.84 --> 5781.78]  you're the same way.
[5782.20 --> 5784.72]  And so while I enjoy playing
[5784.72 --> 5785.86]  with players who are much better,
[5786.68 --> 5786.84]  I,
[5786.98 --> 5787.10]  if,
[5787.22 --> 5789.02]  if I feel like it's a total waste
[5789.02 --> 5789.58]  of their time
[5789.58 --> 5790.22]  and they're giving it
[5790.22 --> 5791.54]  like a 60% effort,
[5791.54 --> 5792.40]  I'd rather we both
[5792.40 --> 5794.02]  just conserved our energy.
[5794.22 --> 5794.36]  Yeah.
[5794.46 --> 5794.62]  I,
[5794.62 --> 5795.30]  I would,
[5795.56 --> 5796.16]  I want it.
[5796.28 --> 5797.16]  I don't mind losing
[5797.16 --> 5798.38]  as long as I can reflect
[5798.38 --> 5799.40]  on that situation
[5799.40 --> 5800.42]  and figure out
[5800.42 --> 5801.38]  how I can do better
[5801.38 --> 5802.18]  moving forward.
[5802.18 --> 5802.98]  And maybe that's not
[5802.98 --> 5803.62]  an immediate thing.
[5804.00 --> 5804.82]  Maybe in a,
[5804.90 --> 5805.08]  in,
[5805.14 --> 5806.04]  in like a shooting game,
[5806.06 --> 5806.32]  it's like,
[5806.34 --> 5806.50]  okay,
[5806.50 --> 5807.72]  I need to sit on some aim trainers
[5807.72 --> 5808.28]  because honestly,
[5808.28 --> 5809.82]  this guy kept his aim around me
[5809.82 --> 5810.70]  significantly better
[5810.70 --> 5811.70]  than I kept mine on his
[5811.70 --> 5812.52]  and I lost
[5812.52 --> 5813.06]  because he's just
[5813.06 --> 5814.30]  better at the game.
[5814.40 --> 5814.50]  Yeah.
[5814.52 --> 5814.70]  It's like,
[5814.74 --> 5814.96]  okay,
[5815.00 --> 5815.38]  well I,
[5815.44 --> 5816.36]  I want to practice that.
[5816.54 --> 5817.50]  Someone just mentioned in the chat,
[5817.80 --> 5819.80]  Valve just banned 40,000 players
[5819.80 --> 5820.30]  from Dota.
[5820.42 --> 5821.58]  We do need to talk about that.
[5821.82 --> 5821.98]  Yeah.
[5822.06 --> 5822.40]  So like,
[5822.44 --> 5822.80]  it's not,
[5822.86 --> 5824.00]  it's not just shooters either.
[5824.16 --> 5824.78]  Super cool.
[5824.86 --> 5825.74]  They put a honey pot
[5825.74 --> 5826.38]  into the game.
[5826.42 --> 5829.18]  So there's like a particular memory,
[5829.68 --> 5830.28]  um,
[5830.38 --> 5830.84]  like a,
[5830.84 --> 5832.38]  like a chunk of memory
[5832.38 --> 5833.80]  that had some kind
[5833.80 --> 5834.74]  of useful data,
[5834.74 --> 5836.92]  but that they made it
[5836.92 --> 5837.46]  so the game
[5837.46 --> 5838.46]  would never actually
[5838.46 --> 5839.46]  look in it.
[5839.46 --> 5842.12]  so only third party applications
[5842.12 --> 5843.22]  were checking it.
[5843.46 --> 5843.94]  That's interesting.
[5843.94 --> 5845.64]  And so they basically just went,
[5845.76 --> 5845.90]  yep,
[5845.96 --> 5847.36]  with a very high degree
[5847.36 --> 5847.92]  of certainty,
[5847.92 --> 5849.02]  we can tell that
[5849.02 --> 5850.20]  every single one of you
[5850.20 --> 5850.66]  who,
[5850.78 --> 5851.30]  uh,
[5851.30 --> 5852.66]  checked the values in this,
[5853.06 --> 5853.64]  I think it was,
[5853.74 --> 5854.30]  was it RAM
[5854.30 --> 5855.20]  or was it storage?
[5855.26 --> 5855.84]  I can't remember.
[5856.06 --> 5857.42]  But anyone who looked at this
[5857.42 --> 5858.48]  is a cheater.
[5858.88 --> 5859.48]  Bye bye.
[5860.12 --> 5860.52]  Um,
[5860.52 --> 5861.10]  see you later.
[5861.24 --> 5861.46]  I mean,
[5861.46 --> 5862.56]  for a free to play game,
[5862.74 --> 5863.26]  like realistically,
[5863.46 --> 5863.96]  they'll be back
[5863.96 --> 5864.68]  with a new account
[5864.68 --> 5866.00]  and whatever.
[5866.44 --> 5867.16]  But still they lose
[5867.16 --> 5867.96]  whatever they had.
[5868.04 --> 5868.76]  Whatever they had.
[5868.86 --> 5869.00]  Which is good.
[5869.00 --> 5869.72]  Um,
[5869.72 --> 5870.66]  at least inconveniencing
[5870.66 --> 5871.20]  them is good.
[5871.36 --> 5872.48]  Tools of Ownage says,
[5872.54 --> 5873.16]  and we've actually
[5873.16 --> 5874.14]  talked about this,
[5874.22 --> 5874.52]  um,
[5874.54 --> 5874.84]  you know,
[5875.16 --> 5875.38]  I,
[5875.44 --> 5875.62]  I,
[5875.74 --> 5876.74]  I think I've,
[5876.80 --> 5878.22]  I've gotten less certain,
[5878.22 --> 5879.18]  um,
[5879.42 --> 5880.36]  seeing the,
[5880.44 --> 5881.16]  the catastrophe
[5881.16 --> 5882.14]  that was Stadia
[5882.14 --> 5884.28]  and the complete
[5884.28 --> 5885.48]  lack of newsworthiness
[5885.48 --> 5885.92]  of anything
[5885.92 --> 5886.78]  that's going on with,
[5886.84 --> 5887.46]  I don't even remember
[5887.46 --> 5888.42]  what Amazon's game
[5888.42 --> 5889.04]  streaming service
[5889.04 --> 5889.76]  is called anymore.
[5890.22 --> 5890.42]  I mean,
[5890.46 --> 5891.10]  NVIDIA's had some
[5891.10 --> 5891.78]  big wins lately.
[5891.88 --> 5892.36]  They announced that
[5892.36 --> 5893.36]  partnership with Microsoft.
[5893.86 --> 5894.32]  But,
[5894.38 --> 5894.56]  uh,
[5894.56 --> 5895.18]  Tools of Ownage
[5895.18 --> 5895.76]  talks about,
[5895.88 --> 5896.06]  well,
[5896.28 --> 5897.42]  the solution could be
[5897.42 --> 5898.08]  game streaming.
[5898.08 --> 5899.46]  So that everything
[5899.46 --> 5900.44]  is server side.
[5900.82 --> 5901.18]  Everything.
[5901.86 --> 5903.00]  That wouldn't help
[5903.00 --> 5903.92]  with something like
[5903.92 --> 5904.90]  a camera pointed at
[5904.90 --> 5905.30]  the screen
[5905.30 --> 5906.04]  and like the mouse
[5906.04 --> 5906.50]  playing the thing.
[5906.58 --> 5907.36]  But I,
[5907.72 --> 5908.98]  other than farming gold
[5908.98 --> 5909.44]  or something,
[5909.58 --> 5909.84]  you know,
[5909.88 --> 5910.10]  like,
[5910.66 --> 5911.60]  there's an old reference,
[5911.74 --> 5911.88]  you know,
[5911.88 --> 5912.08]  wow,
[5912.08 --> 5912.44]  wow,
[5912.54 --> 5913.18]  wow style,
[5913.24 --> 5913.42]  right?
[5913.42 --> 5914.48]  Um,
[5915.14 --> 5915.44]  you know,
[5915.46 --> 5915.72]  that,
[5915.96 --> 5916.34]  I think,
[5916.38 --> 5917.30]  I think that
[5917.30 --> 5919.10]  if the cheat
[5919.10 --> 5920.04]  gets to the point
[5920.04 --> 5921.24]  where they're not
[5921.24 --> 5922.78]  even sitting in front
[5922.78 --> 5923.86]  of the computer anymore,
[5923.86 --> 5925.74]  I think a lot fewer
[5925.74 --> 5926.58]  users will be
[5926.58 --> 5927.90]  incentivized to do it.
[5927.92 --> 5928.54]  I think the,
[5928.54 --> 5929.34]  the problem that I'm
[5929.34 --> 5930.10]  having with this type
[5930.10 --> 5930.76]  of stuff is,
[5930.88 --> 5932.36]  is how intense it is,
[5932.52 --> 5932.84]  you know?
[5933.24 --> 5933.86]  Like it's,
[5933.92 --> 5934.26]  it's,
[5934.38 --> 5936.02]  it's very overwhelming.
[5936.48 --> 5936.84]  Um,
[5937.46 --> 5937.64]  yeah,
[5937.64 --> 5938.48]  things need to be
[5938.48 --> 5939.90]  done about it.
[5941.16 --> 5941.60]  Yeah.
[5941.72 --> 5942.54]  Game streaming though.
[5942.86 --> 5943.60]  We've talked about
[5943.60 --> 5944.76]  how that could be
[5944.76 --> 5945.82]  the reason.
[5946.06 --> 5946.68]  Like I,
[5946.68 --> 5947.48]  I talked about like
[5947.48 --> 5948.24]  gaming experiences
[5948.24 --> 5949.16]  that are impossible,
[5949.16 --> 5950.06]  um,
[5950.06 --> 5950.92]  with everyone,
[5951.20 --> 5951.48]  uh,
[5951.48 --> 5952.10]  with everything done
[5952.10 --> 5952.78]  client side,
[5952.88 --> 5953.04]  like,
[5953.06 --> 5954.56]  like massive environments
[5954.56 --> 5955.06]  or,
[5955.20 --> 5955.54]  you know,
[5955.56 --> 5956.16]  massive,
[5956.48 --> 5957.88]  massively multiplayer games
[5957.88 --> 5958.88]  and things like that.
[5958.88 --> 5959.86]  But I think
[5959.86 --> 5961.38]  getting rid of,
[5961.72 --> 5961.82]  well,
[5961.86 --> 5962.56]  not getting rid of,
[5962.62 --> 5963.64]  but dramatically reducing
[5963.64 --> 5964.38]  cheating could be
[5964.38 --> 5965.50]  a major incentive.
[5965.50 --> 5965.84]  There's,
[5965.92 --> 5966.24]  there's some
[5966.24 --> 5967.20]  interesting stuff too.
[5967.42 --> 5968.68]  Like certain cheats,
[5968.86 --> 5969.60]  uh,
[5969.60 --> 5970.92]  that people use for Tarkov,
[5971.16 --> 5973.88]  you can't actually run
[5973.88 --> 5975.78]  if you have Valorant installed.
[5978.44 --> 5980.26]  Valorant's super invasive,
[5980.26 --> 5981.54]  like ring zero,
[5981.90 --> 5983.22]  ridiculous anti-cheat
[5983.22 --> 5985.24]  will find the Tarkov one
[5985.24 --> 5986.64]  and freak out.
[5988.22 --> 5988.82]  Wow.
[5989.52 --> 5990.90]  So there's another thing
[5990.90 --> 5991.94]  where like part of this
[5991.94 --> 5992.96]  argument wants me to,
[5993.22 --> 5994.16]  wants me to like,
[5994.54 --> 5995.38]  I almost want my
[5995.38 --> 5996.28]  gaming computer
[5996.28 --> 5998.40]  to be like a specific
[5998.40 --> 5999.28]  device for gaming.
[5999.38 --> 5999.90]  Like I almost want
[5999.90 --> 6000.64]  my gaming computer
[6000.64 --> 6001.78]  to go more into like
[6001.78 --> 6003.16]  the console direction
[6003.16 --> 6005.04]  where it's like,
[6005.10 --> 6005.38]  okay,
[6005.38 --> 6005.70]  well,
[6005.90 --> 6006.18]  yeah,
[6006.24 --> 6007.42]  I sat here on a WAN show
[6007.42 --> 6008.56]  and got mad about
[6008.56 --> 6010.36]  Valorant's ring zero
[6010.36 --> 6011.02]  anti-cheat,
[6011.66 --> 6013.22]  but at the same time,
[6013.66 --> 6014.52]  I don't want cheaters
[6014.52 --> 6015.08]  in my game.
[6015.18 --> 6015.90]  I'd be pretty okay
[6015.90 --> 6016.96]  with like installing
[6016.96 --> 6017.84]  a separate SSD
[6017.84 --> 6019.08]  or partition or whatever
[6019.08 --> 6020.28]  and just having that
[6020.28 --> 6021.76]  for only games
[6021.76 --> 6022.18]  and I use it
[6022.18 --> 6023.08]  for nothing other
[6023.08 --> 6023.58]  than games
[6023.58 --> 6024.62]  and I just let
[6024.62 --> 6025.62]  invasive stuff come in
[6025.62 --> 6026.40]  and people are going
[6026.40 --> 6026.88]  to bring up,
[6027.02 --> 6027.04]  oh,
[6027.04 --> 6027.76]  I can look at other
[6027.76 --> 6029.86]  I don't know
[6029.86 --> 6030.46]  what the exact
[6030.46 --> 6031.46]  perfect answer is,
[6031.96 --> 6032.56]  but like,
[6033.56 --> 6038.80]  this ain't it
[6038.80 --> 6042.14]  is what I have to say.
[6042.38 --> 6042.52]  Yeah.
[6042.70 --> 6043.76]  You know what might be it?
[6043.86 --> 6044.62]  Maybe we should do
[6044.62 --> 6045.62]  a couple merch messages.
[6045.78 --> 6045.96]  Dan,
[6046.02 --> 6046.48]  do you want to hit us
[6046.48 --> 6047.40]  with some merch messages
[6047.40 --> 6048.04]  while we,
[6049.12 --> 6051.56]  before we do some more topics
[6051.56 --> 6052.10]  or sponsors
[6052.10 --> 6053.20]  or whatever the heck it is?
[6053.26 --> 6054.44]  If you guys are not familiar
[6054.44 --> 6055.28]  with merch messages,
[6055.94 --> 6057.78]  you check out the cool stuff
[6057.78 --> 6058.92]  on ltdstore.com.
[6059.00 --> 6060.52]  We showed off the new WAN desk pad.
[6060.62 --> 6061.22]  We've also launched
[6061.22 --> 6062.44]  a lot of great stuff recently.
[6062.64 --> 6064.00]  The track suit is actually
[6064.00 --> 6064.52]  doing really,
[6064.68 --> 6064.96]  really well.
[6065.02 --> 6065.72]  You guys seem to be
[6065.72 --> 6066.72]  super into that.
[6066.72 --> 6069.08]  Or you can just,
[6069.20 --> 6069.82]  if you just want to send
[6069.82 --> 6070.40]  a merch message,
[6070.64 --> 6072.44]  you can just like pick up
[6072.44 --> 6072.90]  a gift card
[6072.90 --> 6073.56]  or something like that.
[6073.60 --> 6074.50]  You can pick something up later
[6074.50 --> 6075.70]  if nothing catches your fancy,
[6076.14 --> 6077.38]  but Dan might reply to you.
[6077.46 --> 6078.34]  If you have like a shout out,
[6078.40 --> 6079.10]  it can go up here,
[6079.20 --> 6080.92]  but he usually selects a few
[6080.92 --> 6081.86]  for me and Luke
[6081.86 --> 6082.92]  to address on the show
[6082.92 --> 6083.44]  and we're going to do
[6083.44 --> 6084.12]  a couple of those now
[6084.12 --> 6084.48]  and then we'll do
[6084.48 --> 6084.90]  some more later.
[6085.44 --> 6085.60]  Sure.
[6085.68 --> 6086.74]  I've got one here from Matthew.
[6087.14 --> 6088.10]  Hi, Linus and Luke.
[6088.20 --> 6088.90]  Long time fan.
[6088.98 --> 6089.38]  Hi, Matthew.
[6089.54 --> 6090.60]  First time merch messenger.
[6091.12 --> 6091.74]  Mystery shirt
[6091.74 --> 6093.24]  for that real life loot box.
[6093.74 --> 6093.94]  Nice.
[6093.94 --> 6094.62]  When it comes to hiring,
[6094.78 --> 6095.98]  do you find all applicants
[6095.98 --> 6096.68]  are fans?
[6096.92 --> 6097.90]  Does that make it
[6097.90 --> 6098.70]  difficult to hire?
[6098.92 --> 6100.12]  Not even close.
[6100.84 --> 6101.20]  Honestly,
[6101.32 --> 6102.42]  the bigger we've grown,
[6102.64 --> 6104.32]  the lower percentage
[6104.32 --> 6108.20]  that claim to be viewers,
[6108.60 --> 6111.28]  especially as we've grown
[6111.28 --> 6112.44]  outside of hiring
[6112.44 --> 6113.70]  just video editors
[6113.70 --> 6115.42]  and tech writers.
[6115.78 --> 6117.12]  I've also had experiences
[6117.12 --> 6118.54]  where I think what's happening
[6118.54 --> 6120.02]  is there's fans of the channel
[6120.02 --> 6120.88]  that know people
[6120.88 --> 6121.60]  that do things
[6121.60 --> 6122.42]  that we're hiring for
[6122.42 --> 6124.16]  that like link them
[6124.16 --> 6125.00]  in the job posting
[6125.00 --> 6126.70]  because I've asked people
[6126.70 --> 6127.02]  like,
[6127.74 --> 6129.22]  how did you find this?
[6129.26 --> 6129.82]  And they're just like,
[6129.86 --> 6130.90]  it's a job posting.
[6130.96 --> 6131.44]  What do you mean?
[6132.58 --> 6133.70]  What's what?
[6134.94 --> 6136.02]  I don't want to give away
[6136.02 --> 6136.90]  what interview
[6136.90 --> 6137.94]  I'm talking about too much,
[6138.28 --> 6139.18]  but let's say
[6139.18 --> 6139.92]  this is not the question
[6139.92 --> 6140.22]  I asked.
[6140.28 --> 6140.44]  Yeah.
[6140.44 --> 6141.64]  What's your favorite video?
[6141.72 --> 6142.78]  If someone complained
[6142.78 --> 6143.80]  about your interview process
[6143.80 --> 6144.68]  on Reddit or something,
[6144.68 --> 6147.86]  what's your favorite video
[6147.86 --> 6148.34]  or something?
[6148.34 --> 6149.72]  And they basically just go like,
[6149.78 --> 6150.16]  I don't know.
[6150.22 --> 6151.18]  I don't watch at all.
[6151.26 --> 6151.40]  Yeah.
[6151.46 --> 6151.92]  And it's like,
[6151.96 --> 6152.38]  oh, wow.
[6152.86 --> 6154.72]  Like I didn't actually expect that,
[6154.88 --> 6155.18]  but cool.
[6155.28 --> 6155.42]  Yeah.
[6155.42 --> 6157.36]  Like the Wanshow writer,
[6157.50 --> 6158.26]  new Wanshow writer
[6158.26 --> 6159.64]  who hopefully we can introduce
[6159.64 --> 6160.58]  if she makes it
[6160.58 --> 6161.32]  through her probation
[6161.32 --> 6163.64]  was basically,
[6163.72 --> 6164.06]  I was like,
[6164.06 --> 6165.18]  have you watched the Wanshow?
[6165.36 --> 6166.14]  And she's like,
[6166.40 --> 6166.64]  well,
[6166.72 --> 6167.98]  I did as preparation
[6167.98 --> 6169.00]  for this job.
[6170.06 --> 6170.72]  Fair enough.
[6170.72 --> 6171.00]  Yep.
[6173.44 --> 6173.80]  Yep.
[6174.20 --> 6175.18]  It's like my SO
[6175.18 --> 6175.90]  super into it.
[6176.14 --> 6176.48]  All right.
[6176.56 --> 6176.92]  Fair enough.
[6176.92 --> 6178.46]  I've ranted against,
[6178.70 --> 6179.76]  I think it's like Star Wars
[6179.76 --> 6180.28]  and Halo
[6180.28 --> 6181.46]  where they specifically
[6181.46 --> 6182.28]  hired people
[6182.28 --> 6183.90]  that did not like the franchise
[6183.90 --> 6184.60]  because they like
[6184.60 --> 6185.40]  wanted to make it different.
[6185.60 --> 6186.62]  I think that's stupid,
[6186.80 --> 6188.84]  but you don't have to hire people
[6188.84 --> 6191.00]  that are pre-existing fans either.
[6191.74 --> 6191.76]  Like,
[6193.64 --> 6196.18]  I think I just heard them.
[6196.18 --> 6196.68]  Yeah.
[6199.86 --> 6201.22]  Emotional damage.
[6201.68 --> 6202.04]  Yeah.
[6202.76 --> 6203.08]  Yeah.
[6204.04 --> 6205.14]  I think you threaded
[6205.14 --> 6206.06]  that needle well,
[6206.06 --> 6207.10]  making the reference
[6207.10 --> 6207.82]  recognizable
[6207.82 --> 6209.60]  without crossing into like
[6209.60 --> 6211.70]  questionable.
[6215.06 --> 6215.46]  Anywho.
[6215.66 --> 6216.06]  Got him.
[6216.98 --> 6217.60]  You want another one?
[6217.76 --> 6218.14]  Sure.
[6218.38 --> 6219.18]  This one's from Mason.
[6219.56 --> 6220.46]  Hey, Linus and Luke,
[6220.56 --> 6221.74]  I know bringing on guests
[6221.74 --> 6223.02]  isn't a common theme
[6223.02 --> 6223.62]  for the Wanshow,
[6223.78 --> 6224.74]  but is there a person
[6224.74 --> 6225.90]  that if you had the opportunity
[6225.90 --> 6227.10]  to bring onto the show,
[6227.20 --> 6227.56]  you would?
[6227.62 --> 6228.20]  Bill Watterson.
[6229.04 --> 6229.58]  My hero.
[6230.00 --> 6231.18]  That was no hesitation.
[6231.34 --> 6231.82]  That'd be sweet.
[6231.82 --> 6232.80]  Yeah.
[6232.92 --> 6233.06]  Well,
[6233.14 --> 6233.42]  you know what?
[6233.46 --> 6234.54]  The reason I was thinking about it
[6234.54 --> 6239.42]  was because he's like one of the few creators ever
[6239.42 --> 6244.02]  that I would just buy anything that he licensed.
[6244.80 --> 6244.84]  Like,
[6244.94 --> 6246.30]  I have never not enjoyed.
[6246.42 --> 6248.76]  I would have Calvin and Hobbes anything.
[6248.90 --> 6249.08]  Yeah.
[6249.08 --> 6253.14]  And he stubbornly refuses to give it to me
[6253.14 --> 6253.96]  because he's like,
[6254.92 --> 6255.12]  eh,
[6255.60 --> 6257.34]  you shouldn't merchandise things for money.
[6257.40 --> 6257.78]  And I'm like,
[6257.88 --> 6258.16]  okay,
[6258.52 --> 6259.94]  that's fair and I respect it,
[6260.00 --> 6261.72]  but I really want to throw money at you.
[6261.90 --> 6262.20]  So this,
[6262.46 --> 6264.38]  we're at an impasse here.
[6264.38 --> 6267.28]  Just create more stuff then.
[6267.96 --> 6268.74]  But I mean,
[6268.80 --> 6270.46]  the last thing I would want to do
[6270.46 --> 6271.28]  is bother him though.
[6271.76 --> 6272.58]  So anyway,
[6272.66 --> 6273.64]  the reason I was thinking about it
[6273.64 --> 6275.64]  was because I was sort of reflecting on my fandom.
[6275.78 --> 6277.28]  I'm not a fan of much.
[6278.12 --> 6280.16]  I am a fan of Bill Watterson.
[6281.14 --> 6282.78]  And what made me think about it
[6282.78 --> 6284.18]  was the conversation we were having
[6284.18 --> 6285.44]  a little while back on Wanshow
[6285.44 --> 6286.80]  about fan interactions
[6286.80 --> 6288.76]  and what the right way
[6288.76 --> 6289.90]  or wrong way to approach them.
[6289.98 --> 6290.74]  And what I realized
[6290.74 --> 6292.06]  is that while you and I talked about
[6292.06 --> 6292.98]  what works for us,
[6292.98 --> 6296.20]  I feel like you would have to tailor it.
[6296.32 --> 6297.26]  If I ran into someone
[6297.26 --> 6300.18]  that wants to be talked to
[6300.18 --> 6301.14]  and wants to be approached,
[6301.30 --> 6302.28]  I would take a different approach.
[6302.34 --> 6303.70]  Whereas if I ran into Bill Watterson,
[6303.88 --> 6305.46]  I would say absolutely nothing.
[6305.54 --> 6305.98]  I would just go,
[6306.70 --> 6308.42]  and then I would like leave.
[6308.82 --> 6308.94]  Right?
[6309.02 --> 6309.38]  Because.
[6309.96 --> 6310.18]  Do you think,
[6310.24 --> 6311.06]  do you think it's appropriate
[6311.06 --> 6313.16]  to do like the head nod at least?
[6315.10 --> 6315.46]  Um,
[6315.60 --> 6316.66]  I don't know.
[6316.86 --> 6317.60]  I've done that before.
[6317.86 --> 6319.66]  Everything I've ever read about him
[6319.66 --> 6321.32]  and he doesn't do a lot of interviews.
[6321.56 --> 6322.78]  He just doesn't want anything.
[6322.98 --> 6325.72]  He just like seems to value his privacy.
[6326.64 --> 6327.52]  And, uh.
[6327.66 --> 6328.14]  Fair enough.
[6328.94 --> 6329.34]  I just,
[6329.50 --> 6330.60]  I'm like, okay.
[6331.38 --> 6332.64]  But if I had it,
[6332.68 --> 6334.00]  if I could pick anyone to have
[6334.00 --> 6334.74]  on the Wanshow,
[6334.98 --> 6335.24]  then I'm like,
[6335.28 --> 6336.26]  all right, let's go.
[6336.48 --> 6336.74]  Cool.
[6337.06 --> 6337.52]  Let's go.
[6337.58 --> 6338.78]  As long as it wouldn't bother him,
[6338.82 --> 6340.48]  I would respectfully ask
[6340.48 --> 6341.52]  for him to be on the Wanshow.
[6341.52 --> 6342.32]  So,
[6342.32 --> 6342.76]  so assuming,
[6342.92 --> 6343.68]  assuming like,
[6343.82 --> 6344.08]  uh,
[6344.08 --> 6344.74]  um,
[6345.52 --> 6346.36]  um,
[6347.64 --> 6349.00]  it's a consensual,
[6349.16 --> 6350.90]  I can have anyone on the Wanshow,
[6350.96 --> 6351.22]  you know?
[6352.00 --> 6352.28]  Yeah.
[6352.58 --> 6352.94]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6352.96 --> 6353.80]  Because that'd be uncomfortable.
[6353.80 --> 6355.96]  Like I can force anyone at gunpoint
[6355.96 --> 6356.92]  to be on the Wanshow.
[6357.02 --> 6357.14]  Like,
[6357.18 --> 6357.30]  no,
[6357.42 --> 6357.52]  no,
[6357.52 --> 6358.68]  no,
[6358.90 --> 6359.80]  that's not cool.
[6361.80 --> 6362.68]  I think,
[6363.30 --> 6365.68]  huh,
[6366.48 --> 6367.92]  I think Todd Howard.
[6368.52 --> 6369.04]  Hmm.
[6369.04 --> 6369.10]  Hmm.
[6369.10 --> 6369.50]  Hmm.
[6369.50 --> 6370.76]  Hmm.
[6371.52 --> 6373.26]  Because I would genuinely
[6373.26 --> 6376.32]  be very interested
[6376.32 --> 6377.52]  in the conversation
[6377.52 --> 6379.84]  more than I would actually
[6379.84 --> 6380.94]  be interested in like,
[6381.32 --> 6382.16]  I'm going to fanboy
[6382.16 --> 6382.96]  over Todd Howard,
[6383.18 --> 6383.52]  you know?
[6383.98 --> 6384.30]  Hmm.
[6384.30 --> 6384.60]  Okay.
[6385.74 --> 6386.14]  Sure.
[6387.28 --> 6387.64]  I don't know.
[6388.38 --> 6389.24]  I can tell him
[6389.24 --> 6389.86]  that the Wanshow
[6389.86 --> 6390.62]  just works.
[6394.64 --> 6395.08]  Wow.
[6395.60 --> 6396.54]  Give us one more
[6396.54 --> 6397.24]  and then we'll move on.
[6397.50 --> 6397.70]  All right,
[6397.72 --> 6398.84]  that sounds good to me.
[6399.10 --> 6399.62]  To Ro Sim.
[6399.68 --> 6399.94]  No,
[6400.04 --> 6400.70]  and I understand
[6400.70 --> 6401.72]  why people would say that,
[6401.86 --> 6403.50]  but just to talk.
[6404.88 --> 6405.06]  Yeah.
[6405.14 --> 6405.52]  I would,
[6405.54 --> 6406.60]  I would ask him things
[6406.60 --> 6407.98]  that I think people
[6407.98 --> 6409.10]  that would want to roast him
[6409.10 --> 6409.60]  would ask,
[6409.68 --> 6410.60]  but I would also ask him
[6410.60 --> 6411.26]  things that I think
[6411.26 --> 6412.34]  are automatic wins.
[6412.74 --> 6412.86]  It,
[6413.42 --> 6415.34]  just because horse armor exists
[6415.34 --> 6416.12]  and some other things
[6416.12 --> 6416.56]  have happened
[6416.56 --> 6418.24]  doesn't mean that he hasn't
[6418.24 --> 6420.28]  made absolutely legendary
[6420.28 --> 6421.70]  products at the same time.
[6421.70 --> 6421.84]  Sure.
[6422.20 --> 6422.52]  So,
[6422.88 --> 6423.04]  yeah.
[6423.10 --> 6423.60]  That's fair.
[6423.60 --> 6424.98]  Okay,
[6425.04 --> 6426.02]  this one's from Marcus.
[6426.22 --> 6427.26]  Any tips for devices
[6427.26 --> 6427.92]  slash tech
[6427.92 --> 6428.92]  to have in a studio
[6428.92 --> 6430.20]  student apartment?
[6433.10 --> 6434.04]  A computer.
[6437.14 --> 6438.80]  Studio student apartment.
[6439.00 --> 6439.50]  Battery banks?
[6439.56 --> 6440.48]  A student studio apartment.
[6440.70 --> 6440.92]  Yeah.
[6441.18 --> 6441.64]  A laptop?
[6441.64 --> 6441.74]  A laptop?
[6441.74 --> 6446.06]  Light bulbs.
[6448.06 --> 6449.96]  TI-83 plus graphing calculator.
[6450.10 --> 6450.42]  Nice.
[6450.58 --> 6451.00]  I mean,
[6451.08 --> 6451.90]  or whatever the,
[6451.90 --> 6453.00]  whatever the probably
[6453.00 --> 6454.28]  much newer one is.
[6454.60 --> 6454.76]  No,
[6454.80 --> 6455.50]  it's still that one.
[6455.90 --> 6456.78]  Is it really?
[6457.44 --> 6457.90]  Shut up.
[6457.94 --> 6458.04]  No,
[6458.08 --> 6458.54]  it's not.
[6459.34 --> 6460.36]  Ask floatplane chat.
[6460.42 --> 6461.04]  I'm pretty sure it is.
[6461.04 --> 6461.54]  Can't be.
[6461.80 --> 6462.24]  What is it,
[6462.30 --> 6462.42]  sorry?
[6462.76 --> 6464.78]  TI-80 something has been
[6464.78 --> 6466.22]  TI-83 plus was what I said.
[6466.28 --> 6467.26]  There's got to be a newer one.
[6467.32 --> 6467.98]  There's no way.
[6468.08 --> 6469.18]  And there's still $200.
[6469.62 --> 6470.42]  That's stupid.
[6471.76 --> 6472.52]  That's stupid.
[6472.90 --> 6473.34]  We should,
[6473.44 --> 6474.72]  we should make a clone
[6474.72 --> 6475.68]  on LTT store.
[6477.00 --> 6478.30]  TI-84 apparently.
[6478.46 --> 6478.58]  No,
[6478.66 --> 6478.82]  no,
[6478.88 --> 6479.58]  they've moved on.
[6479.74 --> 6480.34]  They've moved on.
[6480.42 --> 6481.44]  TI-84 silver.
[6481.82 --> 6482.16]  Wow,
[6482.32 --> 6483.18]  except I'm pretty sure
[6483.18 --> 6484.24]  that has been there
[6484.24 --> 6485.56]  for like at least a decade.
[6486.08 --> 6486.46]  Okay,
[6486.56 --> 6486.66]  yeah,
[6486.72 --> 6486.84]  no,
[6486.92 --> 6487.26]  there's there.
[6487.28 --> 6488.10]  TI-84 plus?
[6488.46 --> 6488.76]  Yeah,
[6488.76 --> 6489.30]  all right.
[6490.26 --> 6492.40]  TI-89 titanium.
[6492.40 --> 6494.98]  Let's go.
[6496.28 --> 6496.68]  Wow,
[6496.68 --> 6498.14]  this thing looks ancient.
[6500.42 --> 6500.82]  Jeez.
[6503.96 --> 6504.56]  All right.
[6505.38 --> 6505.92]  All right,
[6505.98 --> 6506.50]  why don't we move on
[6506.50 --> 6507.12]  to our next topic?
[6507.38 --> 6507.40]  Oh,
[6507.66 --> 6507.86]  oh,
[6507.92 --> 6508.26]  they have,
[6508.36 --> 6510.60]  they have like a TI inspire
[6510.60 --> 6512.04]  and it has like a color screen
[6512.04 --> 6512.50]  and stuff.
[6512.88 --> 6513.72]  We got to do sponsors.
[6514.24 --> 6515.32]  The show is brought to you today
[6515.32 --> 6516.00]  by the Ridge.
[6516.40 --> 6517.70]  Reduce your pocket clutter
[6517.70 --> 6518.48]  with the Ridge.
[6518.56 --> 6519.60]  Is your old bulky wallet
[6519.60 --> 6520.62]  weighing down your pants?
[6520.76 --> 6521.24]  No worries.
[6521.34 --> 6521.84]  The Ridge wallet
[6521.84 --> 6522.64]  is the solution
[6522.64 --> 6523.94]  to that problem.
[6524.46 --> 6525.20]  It won't solve
[6525.20 --> 6526.42]  all your other problems,
[6526.56 --> 6528.04]  but it will solve that one.
[6528.40 --> 6529.60]  It's simple yet elegant,
[6529.74 --> 6530.68]  holds up to 12 cards
[6530.68 --> 6531.90]  and still has room for cash
[6531.90 --> 6532.52]  with a money clip
[6532.52 --> 6533.52]  or elastic band.
[6533.86 --> 6534.52]  Its low profile
[6534.52 --> 6535.34]  means that the Ridge wallet
[6535.34 --> 6536.24]  will fit in most pockets
[6536.24 --> 6537.16]  and bag compartments
[6537.16 --> 6538.58]  and it's made with premium,
[6538.74 --> 6540.56]  high quality RFID blocking materials
[6540.56 --> 6541.40]  to prevent theft.
[6541.64 --> 6542.96]  They even offer
[6542.96 --> 6544.32]  a lifetime warranty.
[6544.74 --> 6545.56]  With over 30 colors
[6545.56 --> 6546.42]  and styles to choose from,
[6546.48 --> 6546.92]  the Ridge wallet
[6546.92 --> 6547.64]  will have a design
[6547.64 --> 6548.56]  just for you
[6548.56 --> 6550.08]  and over 50,000
[6550.08 --> 6551.08]  satisfied customers
[6551.08 --> 6552.08]  recommend the Ridge wallet
[6552.08 --> 6553.22]  making it the perfect gift
[6553.22 --> 6554.38]  for a friend or loved one
[6554.38 --> 6555.70]  or a nice treat for yourself.
[6556.18 --> 6557.06]  If you're still on the fence,
[6557.18 --> 6557.76]  just try it out.
[6557.94 --> 6558.56]  They're so confident
[6558.56 --> 6559.08]  you'll love it.
[6559.16 --> 6560.20]  They offer a 45-day
[6560.20 --> 6560.96]  test drive period
[6560.96 --> 6561.94]  and if you're unsatisfied,
[6562.14 --> 6563.54]  you can simply send the wallet back
[6563.54 --> 6564.70]  for a full refund.
[6565.04 --> 6565.66]  So don't wait.
[6566.46 --> 6567.10]  Check it out
[6567.10 --> 6568.40]  at the link in the video description
[6568.40 --> 6569.50]  and make sure you use code
[6569.50 --> 6570.02]  WAN,
[6570.08 --> 6570.98]  W-A-N,

[6576.64 --> 6577.48]  by Squarespace.

[6579.10 --> 6580.16]  and don't have the know-how,
[6580.28 --> 6581.70]  Squarespace makes it easy.
[6581.78 --> 6583.08]  You can learn all about Squarespace
[6583.08 --> 6584.20]  by just typing in,
[6584.52 --> 6585.58]  hey, ChatGPT,
[6585.70 --> 6586.26]  type me up,
[6586.30 --> 6587.34]  a great sponsor read
[6587.34 --> 6587.84]  for Squarespace.
[6588.12 --> 6590.36]  We've actually done that
[6590.36 --> 6590.96]  a couple times.
[6591.80 --> 6593.12]  ChatGPT sells Squarespace
[6593.12 --> 6594.64]  like nobody's business.
[6595.08 --> 6595.44]  Anyway,
[6595.58 --> 6596.58]  I can still try.
[6596.96 --> 6598.06]  There's a wide selection
[6598.06 --> 6599.24]  of award-winning templates,
[6599.38 --> 6600.48]  all optimized for mobile

[6618.16 --> 6619.48]  their 24-7 customer support
[6619.48 --> 6620.82]  via live chat and email.
[6621.16 --> 6621.56]  Why wait?
[6621.92 --> 6622.66]  Get started today
[6622.66 --> 6623.94]  by going to squarespace.com
[6623.94 --> 6624.86]  forward slash WAN
[6624.86 --> 6626.12]  and using offer code WAN
[6626.12 --> 6628.16]  to get 10% off your first purchase.
[6628.72 --> 6629.16]  Finally,
[6629.44 --> 6630.38]  the show is brought to you
[6630.38 --> 6630.90]  by JumpCloud.
[6631.38 --> 6633.56]  JumpCloud is an open directory platform
[6633.56 --> 6635.62]  and it can be the IT backbone
[6635.62 --> 6636.80]  of your organization.
[6637.28 --> 6638.04]  It makes it possible
[6638.04 --> 6639.62]  to centralize your technology stack
[6639.62 --> 6640.76]  across identity access
[6640.76 --> 6642.06]  and device management
[6642.06 --> 6643.30]  in a cost-effective manner.
[6643.72 --> 6644.62]  It also helps you manage
[6644.62 --> 6646.12]  the proliferation of identities
[6646.12 --> 6647.20]  created by the cloud
[6647.20 --> 6649.12]  and software as a service applications.
[6649.24 --> 6650.20]  It really is a problem.
[6651.38 --> 6652.42]  You can use JumpCloud
[6652.42 --> 6653.76]  to handle identities and access
[6653.76 --> 6654.88]  with maximum ease
[6654.88 --> 6655.82]  and maximum security.
[6656.36 --> 6657.70]  You can decrease IT expenses
[6657.70 --> 6658.48]  and ongoing costs
[6658.48 --> 6659.68]  and scale your organization
[6659.68 --> 6660.34]  with confidence
[6660.34 --> 6661.50]  without massive tech overhead
[6661.50 --> 6662.90]  and infrastructure or people,
[6662.90 --> 6664.64]  which is definitely something
[6664.64 --> 6666.00]  we're kind of figuring out
[6666.00 --> 6666.98]  is becoming a problem.
[6667.34 --> 6668.36]  And you can meet strict
[6668.36 --> 6669.72]  and increasing regulatory
[6669.72 --> 6670.96]  and compliance requirements
[6670.96 --> 6672.76]  all from the same platform investment.
[6673.22 --> 6673.80]  They've got support
[6673.80 --> 6674.84]  for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
[6675.10 --> 6676.10]  So no matter the platform,
[6676.28 --> 6677.16]  JumpCloud has your back
[6677.16 --> 6678.32]  and you can try them out today
[6678.32 --> 6680.14]  using the link down below.
[6681.58 --> 6682.38]  What do you want to do
[6682.38 --> 6683.04]  for our next topic?
[6684.44 --> 6685.54]  I'm just kind of staring
[6685.54 --> 6686.24]  at merch messages
[6686.24 --> 6687.26]  hoping to get to those.
[6688.64 --> 6689.04]  Really,
[6689.50 --> 6689.68]  like,
[6689.82 --> 6691.10]  very little happened
[6691.10 --> 6692.04]  in the world of tech this week.
[6692.04 --> 6693.16]  It was all, like, legal stuff.
[6693.26 --> 6693.54]  Okay,
[6693.70 --> 6694.82]  I want to talk about
[6694.82 --> 6696.80]  Amazon's telehealth expansion.
[6697.98 --> 6699.12]  Amazon bought
[6699.12 --> 6700.56]  American healthcare provider
[6700.56 --> 6701.50]  One Medical,
[6701.68 --> 6702.60]  which offers subscribers
[6702.60 --> 6704.22]  24-7 on-demand
[6704.22 --> 6705.48]  telehealth services
[6705.48 --> 6707.44]  and same and next-day
[6707.44 --> 6708.80]  in-person medical appointments
[6708.80 --> 6710.98]  at one of its 125 offices.
[6711.30 --> 6712.72]  The deal was announced last year
[6712.72 --> 6713.30]  but was delayed
[6713.30 --> 6715.48]  by an FTC antitrust investigation.
[6716.12 --> 6716.96]  Amazon is looking
[6716.96 --> 6718.44]  to expand One Medical
[6718.44 --> 6720.12]  to compete in U.S. primary care
[6720.12 --> 6721.66]  against other outpatient clinic chains
[6721.66 --> 6722.76]  owned by CVS, Walgreens,
[6722.86 --> 6723.32]  and Walmart.
[6723.88 --> 6724.86]  This has raised concerns
[6724.86 --> 6726.12]  about vertical consolidation
[6726.12 --> 6727.72]  as large corporations
[6727.72 --> 6728.74]  increasingly buy up
[6728.74 --> 6730.02]  smaller players in the market.
[6730.62 --> 6732.18]  Amazon already offers medication
[6732.18 --> 6733.30]  through its online pharmacy
[6733.30 --> 6734.08]  and the acquisition
[6734.08 --> 6735.10]  will give Amazon access
[6735.10 --> 6736.60]  to even more medical data
[6736.60 --> 6738.14]  which it uses for analytics
[6738.14 --> 6739.24]  and machine learning,
[6739.56 --> 6741.00]  both on patient health outcomes
[6741.00 --> 6742.36]  and staff well-being.
[6742.36 --> 6743.62]  There's definitely no issue
[6743.62 --> 6744.50]  with the people
[6744.50 --> 6746.12]  that sell you food
[6746.12 --> 6747.90]  and everything else
[6747.90 --> 6749.04]  that you buy in your life
[6749.04 --> 6750.58]  also having all
[6750.58 --> 6751.42]  of your medical data.
[6752.70 --> 6753.18]  Cool.
[6755.74 --> 6756.22]  Sweet.
[6758.16 --> 6758.60]  I think if people
[6758.60 --> 6759.40]  watch the show for a while
[6759.40 --> 6760.24]  they know that I'm probably
[6760.24 --> 6761.08]  not so into this.
[6763.26 --> 6764.80]  I, for one, think it's great.
[6765.18 --> 6766.60]  I don't believe that at all.
[6768.34 --> 6769.40]  Yeah, I don't know.
[6769.64 --> 6770.72]  I don't like that.
[6771.20 --> 6771.60]  Yeah.
[6772.34 --> 6773.96]  I wonder what's interesting
[6773.96 --> 6775.44]  is if you are currently
[6775.44 --> 6776.78]  a customer of One Medical
[6776.78 --> 6778.66]  and you don't want
[6778.66 --> 6779.56]  your medical data
[6779.56 --> 6781.88]  being taken by Amazon,
[6782.16 --> 6784.82]  I wonder what rights you have
[6784.82 --> 6785.46]  because it's like
[6785.46 --> 6787.40]  I don't think you can GDPR it
[6787.40 --> 6788.94]  because it's an American
[6788.94 --> 6789.84]  only company.
[6789.84 --> 6789.90]  Yeah, because you're an American.
[6790.24 --> 6790.44]  Yeah.
[6790.88 --> 6791.80]  Yeah, get f***ed.
[6791.88 --> 6793.38]  So like, is it just all going
[6793.38 --> 6793.98]  to Amazon no matter what?
[6794.00 --> 6795.02]  There might be a way
[6795.02 --> 6796.20]  to deal with it, but I...
[6796.20 --> 6796.56]  I don't know.
[6796.64 --> 6797.08]  I don't know.
[6797.30 --> 6798.04]  Something to consider
[6798.04 --> 6799.50]  if you are a One Medical customer.
[6799.64 --> 6800.46]  I'm willing to bet
[6800.46 --> 6801.04]  there was something
[6801.04 --> 6802.04]  in their T's and C's
[6802.04 --> 6802.78]  that's like,
[6803.12 --> 6804.04]  yeah, we'll keep everything
[6804.04 --> 6804.80]  super private
[6804.80 --> 6805.58]  and we won't share it
[6805.58 --> 6806.16]  with anybody.
[6806.34 --> 6806.86]  By the way,
[6806.90 --> 6807.54]  we might get acquired
[6807.54 --> 6808.14]  at some point.
[6808.24 --> 6808.50]  Ha ha.
[6809.14 --> 6809.28]  Yeah.
[6810.02 --> 6811.20]  It's usually in there.
[6812.16 --> 6812.54]  Yeah.
[6813.86 --> 6814.54]  I don't know.
[6815.32 --> 6816.32]  It's kind of depressing.
[6817.54 --> 6818.92]  Like, what industry
[6818.92 --> 6820.14]  are they going to not be in
[6820.14 --> 6820.80]  in 20 years?
[6821.34 --> 6821.64]  I mean,
[6822.36 --> 6824.52]  Wall-E is looking more
[6824.52 --> 6825.28]  and more prophetic
[6825.28 --> 6826.00]  by the time.
[6826.30 --> 6827.06]  By the time?
[6827.40 --> 6827.96]  By the day.
[6827.96 --> 6829.98]  I don't remember
[6829.98 --> 6831.10]  what the super company
[6831.10 --> 6832.02]  was in that one.
[6832.54 --> 6833.34]  By and large.
[6833.44 --> 6833.98]  By and large.
[6834.20 --> 6835.46]  Or by and large
[6835.46 --> 6836.70]  or something like that.
[6836.78 --> 6836.90]  Yeah.
[6837.06 --> 6837.66]  So I think they were
[6837.66 --> 6838.48]  basing it off of like...
[6838.48 --> 6839.78]  It was Amazon plus Costco
[6839.78 --> 6840.56]  or something as far
[6840.56 --> 6841.24]  as I could tell.
[6841.42 --> 6841.60]  It's like,
[6841.68 --> 6842.02]  basically,
[6842.02 --> 6842.80]  they were just involved
[6842.80 --> 6844.16]  in everything from
[6844.16 --> 6847.46]  merchandise sales
[6847.46 --> 6848.70]  to space travel.
[6849.98 --> 6850.34]  Okay,
[6850.40 --> 6850.94]  it's Amazon.
[6851.10 --> 6851.50]  Yeah.
[6851.92 --> 6852.38]  Fair enough.
[6852.38 --> 6852.88]  Yeah.
[6856.02 --> 6856.32]  I mean,
[6856.34 --> 6857.26]  at a certain point,
[6857.36 --> 6862.02]  you have so much money
[6862.02 --> 6864.70]  that you can just buy your way
[6864.70 --> 6866.20]  into literally any industry.
[6866.40 --> 6867.94]  We are now a market leader.
[6868.64 --> 6868.94]  Yesterday,
[6869.10 --> 6869.96]  we did not exist.
[6870.96 --> 6872.08]  We just bought,
[6872.20 --> 6874.84]  we just bought the human,
[6875.50 --> 6877.42]  the actual physical assets
[6877.42 --> 6880.78]  and the human knowledge capital,
[6882.30 --> 6885.00]  the entire essence
[6885.00 --> 6886.26]  of this entire industry
[6886.26 --> 6887.48]  now belongs to us.
[6887.94 --> 6888.12]  Lol,
[6888.20 --> 6888.54]  by the way,
[6888.58 --> 6889.60]  the prices are double now.
[6890.54 --> 6891.40]  Hope you like that
[6891.40 --> 6891.86]  because we,
[6892.00 --> 6892.58]  I mean,
[6892.60 --> 6893.50]  we spent a lot on this
[6893.50 --> 6893.94]  and we are,
[6894.32 --> 6895.22]  think of the shareholders.
[6897.32 --> 6898.50]  We've talked about this before.
[6898.50 --> 6899.92]  It's like when,
[6899.92 --> 6901.40]  when Best Buy came up into Canada,
[6901.88 --> 6902.78]  it wasn't like Best Buy
[6902.78 --> 6904.02]  and Future Shop fought for a while.
[6904.14 --> 6906.74]  Future Shop was basically
[6906.74 --> 6907.74]  exactly the same
[6907.74 --> 6908.52]  as Best Buy in Canada.
[6908.52 --> 6909.38]  But like worse
[6909.38 --> 6910.24]  because the salespeople
[6910.24 --> 6910.84]  were commissioned
[6910.84 --> 6912.20]  and really pushy.
[6912.38 --> 6912.58]  Yeah.
[6912.96 --> 6913.20]  Yep.
[6913.60 --> 6914.94]  So that and their color
[6914.94 --> 6915.98]  was red instead of blue.
[6916.42 --> 6916.82]  Other than that,
[6916.94 --> 6917.52]  it was like,
[6917.78 --> 6918.36]  it was yellow?
[6918.86 --> 6919.32]  Best Buy?
[6919.66 --> 6919.92]  No,
[6920.04 --> 6920.58]  Future Shop.
[6920.72 --> 6920.88]  Yeah,
[6920.96 --> 6921.14]  I just,
[6921.28 --> 6921.36]  no,
[6921.54 --> 6922.04]  Best Buy,
[6922.18 --> 6922.54]  yellow.
[6922.80 --> 6923.50]  Best Buy is blue.
[6923.68 --> 6924.38]  Shut up.
[6925.46 --> 6925.76]  Yeah.
[6926.22 --> 6926.76]  Hold on.
[6926.90 --> 6927.24]  Pull.
[6928.08 --> 6928.48]  Pull.
[6928.56 --> 6929.36]  Best Buy is blue.
[6929.50 --> 6929.64]  No,
[6929.72 --> 6930.22]  that's it.
[6930.34 --> 6931.28]  Don't go on the website.
[6931.36 --> 6931.62]  All right.
[6931.80 --> 6932.04]  Pull.
[6932.22 --> 6932.34]  No,
[6932.38 --> 6932.46]  no,
[6932.52 --> 6933.76]  I don't know how to create a pull.
[6934.04 --> 6934.40]  I don't remember.
[6935.14 --> 6935.84]  You always show it to me
[6935.84 --> 6936.52]  and then I always forget.
[6938.70 --> 6939.74]  It's so straightforward.
[6941.18 --> 6941.96]  Best Buy is what?
[6942.02 --> 6942.56]  Primary Color?
[6944.48 --> 6944.80]  Yeah,
[6944.96 --> 6945.14]  yeah,
[6945.24 --> 6945.42]  yeah,
[6945.42 --> 6945.64]  yeah,
[6945.64 --> 6945.88]  yeah,
[6945.88 --> 6945.98]  yeah,
[6945.98 --> 6946.18]  yeah.
[6950.66 --> 6951.02]  Okay.
[6951.06 --> 6951.80]  In the meantime,
[6952.28 --> 6952.80]  what were we,
[6952.80 --> 6953.72]  what were we talking about?
[6954.38 --> 6954.96]  I can't remember.
[6955.08 --> 6955.52]  We were talking about
[6955.52 --> 6956.26]  the by and large.
[6956.70 --> 6956.88]  Yeah,
[6957.02 --> 6957.18]  I,
[6957.64 --> 6958.04]  man,
[6958.04 --> 6959.28]  so Amazon's,
[6959.40 --> 6960.30]  they've got ring,
[6960.56 --> 6961.48]  so they've got cameras
[6961.48 --> 6962.44]  all over your house.
[6963.56 --> 6964.30]  They're going to have
[6964.30 --> 6965.14]  your medical data,
[6965.24 --> 6966.02]  so they're going to know,
[6966.02 --> 6966.40]  like,
[6967.06 --> 6968.18]  don't they have that little robot
[6968.18 --> 6969.14]  with the camera on it too?
[6969.22 --> 6969.56]  Body,
[6969.68 --> 6969.86]  yeah,
[6969.98 --> 6971.50]  like drone thing
[6971.50 --> 6971.98]  and stuff.
[6971.98 --> 6972.28]  like,
[6972.72 --> 6974.32]  they know all the products
[6974.32 --> 6974.86]  you buy.
[6975.20 --> 6976.56]  They're the primary employer
[6976.56 --> 6978.96]  in more than one,
[6979.04 --> 6979.38]  you know,
[6979.38 --> 6982.38]  significant municipality.
[6982.70 --> 6984.04]  Not only can they deliver
[6984.04 --> 6984.66]  your food,
[6985.34 --> 6986.34]  but they also have,
[6986.78 --> 6988.38]  what's that?
[6988.92 --> 6990.02]  Big food chain.
[6990.18 --> 6990.32]  Oh,
[6990.38 --> 6990.78]  Whole Foods.
[6991.08 --> 6992.10]  They also own Whole Foods.
[6993.10 --> 6993.54]  Yeah,
[6993.72 --> 6993.96]  like,
[6995.36 --> 6996.22]  terrifying.
[6996.54 --> 6997.00]  It's blue,
[6997.12 --> 6997.30]  bro.
[6998.66 --> 6999.14]  87,
[6999.14 --> 7000.58]  87% of the votes
[7000.58 --> 7000.88]  are for blue.
[7000.88 --> 7001.14]  It's yellow,
[7001.14 --> 7001.76]  52 for yellow.
[7002.06 --> 7002.24]  What?
[7002.30 --> 7002.48]  No.
[7002.60 --> 7002.76]  Yeah,
[7002.86 --> 7003.74]  55,
[7004.42 --> 7005.50]  55 for yellow.
[7005.88 --> 7006.46]  Not percent.
[7006.66 --> 7007.48]  Yellow's going up.
[7008.48 --> 7009.28]  I think you guys
[7009.28 --> 7010.44]  are just trolling me.
[7010.52 --> 7010.66]  No,
[7010.70 --> 7011.26]  it's blue.
[7012.08 --> 7012.46]  Yes,
[7012.54 --> 7013.78]  yellow is the accent color,
[7013.92 --> 7014.50]  but it's blue.
[7014.66 --> 7015.54]  When you walk in there,
[7015.60 --> 7016.36]  what are they wearing?
[7016.52 --> 7018.28]  When you go up to the store,
[7018.62 --> 7021.74]  what color is the Best Buy logo on?
[7021.86 --> 7022.14]  Boom,
[7022.30 --> 7022.76]  got him,
[7023.00 --> 7023.34]  roasted.
[7023.80 --> 7024.78]  The background's blue.
[7025.72 --> 7026.34]  Shut up,
[7026.38 --> 7026.88]  it's yellow,
[7026.98 --> 7027.36]  isn't it?
[7027.70 --> 7028.48]  The tag?
[7028.60 --> 7029.76]  The tag is yellow,
[7029.82 --> 7030.04]  right?
[7030.18 --> 7031.44]  I'm pretty sure the tag is blue.
[7033.98 --> 7034.34]  Oh,
[7034.38 --> 7035.26]  that tag is yellow.
[7035.36 --> 7035.48]  Yeah,
[7035.48 --> 7035.64]  yeah,
[7035.64 --> 7035.76]  yeah.
[7035.76 --> 7035.96]  Wait,
[7036.12 --> 7036.32]  no,
[7036.52 --> 7037.12]  Luke's screen,
[7037.30 --> 7037.82]  Luke's screen,
[7037.98 --> 7038.70]  what color?
[7038.94 --> 7040.14]  What color is the?
[7040.14 --> 7040.28]  Hold on.
[7040.38 --> 7040.64]  No,
[7040.76 --> 7041.02]  there,
[7041.12 --> 7041.48]  there,
[7041.58 --> 7042.18]  that's what I'm talking about.
[7042.24 --> 7042.42]  Look,
[7043.28 --> 7043.50]  it's,
[7043.62 --> 7044.80]  the background is blue.
[7045.30 --> 7045.62]  I think,
[7045.72 --> 7046.28]  I think the,
[7046.38 --> 7047.14]  I think this is old.
[7047.24 --> 7048.56]  What color was the favicon?
[7049.18 --> 7051.86]  What color does Best Buy think their color is?
[7051.96 --> 7052.36]  Go back,
[7052.42 --> 7052.78]  go back,
[7052.78 --> 7053.00]  no,
[7053.08 --> 7053.72]  you go back.
[7054.26 --> 7055.00]  You have to go back.
[7055.44 --> 7055.84]  Favicon,
[7056.14 --> 7056.46]  yellow,
[7057.02 --> 7058.14]  Best Buy.com.
[7059.32 --> 7059.72]  No,
[7060.02 --> 7060.28]  no,
[7060.28 --> 7060.62]  no.
[7060.72 --> 7060.78]  Best Buy,
[7061.14 --> 7062.28]  employee.
[7062.28 --> 7063.10]  And you're wrong.
[7063.12 --> 7063.44]  Hold on.
[7063.52 --> 7064.32]  And you're wrong.
[7064.32 --> 7064.80]  Hold on,
[7064.86 --> 7065.04]  hold on.
[7065.04 --> 7066.12]  And you're wrong.
[7066.20 --> 7067.12]  They're wearing blue shirts.
[7067.22 --> 7068.10]  They're all wearing blue shirts.
[7068.28 --> 7069.78]  That doesn't mean their color is blue.
[7069.88 --> 7070.98]  Their color is still yellow.
[7071.38 --> 7071.76]  And look,
[7071.88 --> 7072.04]  the,
[7072.04 --> 7072.58]  the banner,
[7072.76 --> 7072.94]  oh,
[7073.00 --> 7073.52]  that's a Windows banner.
[7073.52 --> 7073.66]  No,
[7073.70 --> 7074.92]  we're not looking at your screen anymore.
[7075.08 --> 7075.64]  We can't use that.
[7075.64 --> 7076.68]  We've had enough of your screen.
[7076.74 --> 7077.90]  The uniform is blue.
[7078.28 --> 7078.84]  And yeah,
[7078.90 --> 7080.00]  the yellow logo is old.
[7080.48 --> 7081.70]  The entire building is blue?
[7081.82 --> 7082.12]  I don't know.
[7083.22 --> 7083.90]  I don't know,
[7083.96 --> 7084.24]  guys.
[7084.38 --> 7085.06]  I don't know.
[7087.10 --> 7091.66]  You know it's a good WAN show when we're debating what color Best Buy is.
[7094.14 --> 7096.24]  We do have an update for you guys.
[7097.30 --> 7098.80]  This came up on Reddit.
[7099.72 --> 7105.42]  And it's an update to the Apple unlock story that we talked about recently.
[7105.42 --> 7105.68]  Oh.
[7106.10 --> 7112.38]  So apparently a large number of recent gen Macs have wound up unusable on the secondhand market
[7112.38 --> 7114.42]  due to an activation lock.
[7114.48 --> 7115.58]  Apple does,
[7115.80 --> 7116.54]  it turns out,
[7117.04 --> 7122.24]  have the ability to distinguish between locked devices that have been reported missing or stolen
[7122.24 --> 7124.78]  and locked devices with a clean record.
[7124.78 --> 7126.38]  And in some circumstances,
[7126.38 --> 7130.74]  Apple can and does unlock those devices upon request.
[7130.74 --> 7133.96]  So this is interesting because when we were talking about this,
[7134.16 --> 7135.60]  we were basically saying,
[7135.98 --> 7136.12]  well,
[7136.68 --> 7137.02]  hey,
[7137.02 --> 7140.92]  in the interest of reducing the incentive to steal a device,
[7141.14 --> 7148.26]  we actually kind of support non-bypassable device locks.
[7148.58 --> 7149.04]  Right?
[7149.90 --> 7151.82]  Except that it is bypassable.
[7152.24 --> 7154.26]  So this complicates things.
[7154.74 --> 7160.46]  Users of r slash setup app have submitted dozens of devices through Apple's activation lock removal service,
[7160.62 --> 7162.38]  and a few patterns have emerged.
[7162.76 --> 7163.04]  One,
[7163.46 --> 7165.70]  only devices with a clean status were unlocked.
[7165.84 --> 7166.48]  What does that mean?
[7166.54 --> 7167.00]  Which makes sense.
[7167.14 --> 7169.80]  That it was not reported stolen or missing.
[7169.86 --> 7169.88]  Ah,
[7170.06 --> 7170.64]  makes sense.
[7170.98 --> 7171.28]  Two,
[7171.86 --> 7176.44]  the vast majority of devices unlocked were an iPhone 8 or earlier.
[7176.44 --> 7180.40]  The iPhone 8 was discontinued in April of 2020.
[7181.34 --> 7181.82]  Three,
[7182.54 --> 7186.44]  all unlocked devices had been unused for at least a year.
[7187.44 --> 7187.92]  Four,
[7188.30 --> 7189.80]  when devices were unlocked,
[7189.94 --> 7192.06]  it appeared to happen through an automated system.
[7192.48 --> 7193.56]  When devices were rejected,
[7193.70 --> 7196.32]  it took significantly longer and went through a human review.
[7196.90 --> 7200.66]  So unless there was a fundamental change in the system after April 2020,
[7200.92 --> 7204.94]  this would seem to indicate that Apple might have the ability to unlock newer devices
[7204.94 --> 7209.36]  or could contact the original owner of the device and inform them of the unlock request,
[7209.44 --> 7211.26]  giving them the option to confirm or deny.
[7211.52 --> 7212.98]  We have raised issues with that,
[7213.06 --> 7213.22]  though.
[7213.58 --> 7213.90]  Yeah,
[7214.00 --> 7217.00]  there's potential privacy issues.
[7217.44 --> 7220.36]  I think there's just potential customer experience issues.
[7220.58 --> 7220.60]  Like,
[7220.64 --> 7220.86]  I just,
[7221.02 --> 7221.96]  I wouldn't want,
[7222.06 --> 7222.16]  like,
[7222.26 --> 7222.48]  okay,
[7222.60 --> 7222.80]  so,
[7223.22 --> 7223.38]  what,
[7223.46 --> 7227.02]  I haven't used my HTC Vive in four years,
[7227.02 --> 7229.44]  and for whatever reason,
[7229.54 --> 7230.86]  it was locked somehow.
[7231.66 --> 7233.04]  And HTC just,
[7233.20 --> 7233.42]  what,
[7233.50 --> 7233.62]  like,
[7233.70 --> 7234.72]  phones me and it's like,
[7234.78 --> 7235.00]  hey,
[7235.40 --> 7236.76]  can you deal with this?
[7236.92 --> 7237.16]  I'm like,
[7237.66 --> 7237.88]  I mean,
[7237.94 --> 7238.22]  yeah,
[7238.28 --> 7238.98]  I guess so.
[7239.34 --> 7240.26]  But also,
[7240.82 --> 7241.12]  sorry,
[7241.24 --> 7241.36]  why?
[7241.40 --> 7242.58]  It would just sound like a scam to me.
[7242.60 --> 7242.92]  Yeah,
[7242.92 --> 7244.16]  why are you contacting me?
[7244.22 --> 7244.86]  This is weird.
[7244.86 --> 7246.16]  Email or phone or whatever.
[7246.30 --> 7247.46]  I would just assume it was a scam.
[7248.04 --> 7248.22]  Yeah.
[7248.82 --> 7249.08]  Yeah,
[7249.14 --> 7249.84]  I get that.
[7251.72 --> 7254.34]  Is chat still seriously talking about Best Buy color?
[7254.44 --> 7254.54]  Oh,
[7254.58 --> 7254.66]  no,
[7254.70 --> 7254.98]  they're not.
[7254.98 --> 7258.14]  Anyway,
[7258.68 --> 7259.00]  I,
[7259.04 --> 7259.82]  I don't know.
[7259.90 --> 7263.34]  I just continue to be disappointed by Apple's attitude.
[7264.24 --> 7264.76]  You know,
[7264.80 --> 7265.18]  where they,
[7265.34 --> 7265.62]  they'll,
[7265.82 --> 7269.94]  they'll talk about how great they are and environmentally friendly they are and whatever,
[7270.08 --> 7270.28]  whatever,
[7270.40 --> 7270.66]  whatever.
[7270.66 --> 7274.44]  And then when push comes to shove and they have an opportunity to keep devices out of a landfill,
[7274.44 --> 7278.72]  they invariably do not take that path.
[7279.34 --> 7281.04]  Because at the end of the day,
[7281.18 --> 7284.96]  the only thing their shareholders care about is how many iPhones they sold.
[7284.98 --> 7285.40]  This quarter.
[7286.32 --> 7287.60]  It's just all there is to it.
[7288.06 --> 7289.04]  And if they were just,
[7289.12 --> 7291.86]  if they just owned that and they weren't so like hippie,
[7291.96 --> 7293.28]  touchy feely about everything,
[7293.40 --> 7293.94]  I'd be like,
[7294.00 --> 7294.22]  okay,
[7294.30 --> 7294.46]  yeah,
[7294.52 --> 7294.94]  fair enough.
[7295.02 --> 7300.74]  So you're soulless and evil and you just wear it on your face.
[7300.74 --> 7300.96]  Like,
[7301.00 --> 7301.22]  okay,
[7301.28 --> 7301.60]  fine,
[7302.32 --> 7302.64]  fine.
[7302.64 --> 7304.30]  but just the duplicitous,
[7304.52 --> 7305.46]  the duplicity,
[7306.04 --> 7307.02]  duplicitousness,
[7307.62 --> 7309.24]  two-facedness.
[7309.42 --> 7310.06]  There we go.
[7310.48 --> 7310.70]  Nice.
[7310.78 --> 7311.20]  I just,
[7311.36 --> 7312.90]  I find it so hard to deal with.
[7313.64 --> 7316.00]  There's one that we might actually disagree on,
[7316.06 --> 7316.80]  which might be interesting.
[7316.90 --> 7317.20]  Hit me.
[7317.70 --> 7318.58]  China suppresses.
[7318.58 --> 7319.20]  I disagree.
[7320.46 --> 7322.92]  China suppresses public access to AI chat.
[7322.92 --> 7323.32]  No,
[7323.32 --> 7323.50]  they didn't.
[7325.66 --> 7331.98]  Regulators in China are apparently telling Chinese tech companies to restrict access to AI powered chatbots made outside of China
[7331.98 --> 7335.68]  and to report to the government before launching their own in-house chatbots.
[7335.92 --> 7336.00]  No,
[7336.04 --> 7336.46]  I disagree.
[7336.72 --> 7345.52]  AI image generators are already censored in China and Baidu's chatbot Ernie will refuse to generate images of Tiananmen Square.
[7345.72 --> 7346.26]  That makes sense.
[7346.56 --> 7350.08]  Synthetic content like deepfakes are far more restricted than in the West,
[7350.08 --> 7352.08]  not only to protect citizens from impersonation,
[7352.94 --> 7357.50]  but likewise to restrict the potential for parody and mockery of Chinese authorities.
[7358.06 --> 7361.90]  It is possible that the same factors that make large language models,
[7361.98 --> 7371.76]  sometimes respond unpredictably or fabricate information may also make them difficult to effectively censor unless their data set is also fully censored.
[7372.68 --> 7373.32]  Yeah,
[7373.42 --> 7374.10]  this could be,
[7374.30 --> 7377.18]  I've just unrelated to these notes here.
[7377.26 --> 7377.48]  I was,
[7377.48 --> 7384.06]  I was reading about this and apparently there's some criticism in China of the government's efforts to restrict this,
[7384.34 --> 7387.76]  the data sets of these large language models and basically going like,
[7387.84 --> 7388.00]  look,
[7388.00 --> 7389.86]  because of,
[7389.92 --> 7390.20]  you know,
[7390.32 --> 7390.80]  what,
[7391.16 --> 7391.48]  you know,
[7391.48 --> 7393.02]  you're being thin skinned about,
[7393.14 --> 7393.46]  you know,
[7394.06 --> 7396.10]  Winnie the Pooh generated images or whatever.
[7396.60 --> 7400.28]  We're going to fall behind America in this tech war.
[7400.38 --> 7401.52]  Are you serious right now?
[7401.66 --> 7402.52]  Here's the thing though.
[7402.66 --> 7402.82]  Yeah.
[7402.86 --> 7404.34]  What is your stance on them?
[7405.08 --> 7406.94]  So I didn't actually know the whole thing,
[7407.08 --> 7408.12]  which is why I thought we were going to disagree.
[7408.38 --> 7408.88]  So I'm going to,
[7408.88 --> 7410.46]  I'm going to narrow it down slightly.
[7410.64 --> 7412.44]  So just them blocking,
[7412.78 --> 7413.62]  uh,
[7414.82 --> 7417.76]  let's say outside of China made.
[7418.02 --> 7418.08]  Yeah.
[7418.08 --> 7419.24]  That doesn't surprise me at all.
[7419.62 --> 7420.58]  What is your stance on that?
[7421.30 --> 7421.54]  Well,
[7421.58 --> 7421.82]  I mean,
[7421.86 --> 7422.70]  what do you think they should do?
[7422.76 --> 7423.70]  I just think it's stupid.
[7424.78 --> 7426.28]  So what is your,
[7426.44 --> 7430.32]  I think I knew you said that at some point.
[7430.32 --> 7432.32]  I don't know if we were like talking about it offline or what.
[7432.44 --> 7437.30]  So that's why I thought we would disagree because I don't actually necessarily think it's that stupid because,
[7437.30 --> 7444.06]  and my reason for this is look at how we're all reacting to tick tock existing at all in the West.
[7444.60 --> 7444.92]  Oh,
[7445.62 --> 7454.52]  China's using a different algorithm here to get the kids to watch dumb things so that they don't have good aspirations when they're getting older and all this type of stuff that we have talked about on the WAN show before.
[7454.52 --> 7459.56]  I don't know that I would assign like causality necessarily to those things.
[7459.66 --> 7460.40]  I think there are,
[7460.46 --> 7462.18]  there are much,
[7462.80 --> 7464.30]  I think,
[7464.40 --> 7465.74]  I don't think tick tock's helping.
[7465.74 --> 7468.36]  As far as my understanding goes,
[7468.46 --> 7471.82]  there is a difference in the algorithm for in China and out of China,
[7471.90 --> 7472.64]  where in China,
[7472.74 --> 7477.08]  it directs them more to like science and education type topics and like wellness stuff.
[7477.12 --> 7478.12]  And outside of China,
[7478.18 --> 7481.12]  it directs them to just who's making them watch the app more.
[7481.60 --> 7481.96]  Yeah.
[7482.00 --> 7482.26]  Okay.
[7482.26 --> 7483.76]  Which is to be completely honest,
[7483.98 --> 7487.38]  not different to how basically anything that's made in the West is made anyways.
[7487.68 --> 7489.12]  So the criticism there is interesting,
[7489.54 --> 7489.66]  but,
[7489.74 --> 7491.28]  but you know,
[7491.54 --> 7493.80]  but I don't know if I was,
[7493.80 --> 7497.02]  if I was the Chinese government,
[7497.02 --> 7500.56]  I would be concerned about like chat GPT.
[7500.82 --> 7502.28]  I think I would be losing this tech war.
[7502.76 --> 7503.74]  Not only just that,
[7503.86 --> 7506.64]  but we've had the conversation here,
[7506.64 --> 7506.94]  right?
[7506.94 --> 7509.10]  To be able to make these things work better.
[7509.24 --> 7512.82]  Say you're a software developer to make it be able to work better.
[7512.82 --> 7514.98]  You might have to give it some information.
[7516.24 --> 7518.26]  So if they allow everyone to use it,
[7518.94 --> 7521.48]  imagine you're a developer for X government.
[7521.62 --> 7521.84]  Let's not,
[7521.96 --> 7522.14]  let's,
[7522.24 --> 7526.30]  let's remove China from the conversation because there's a lot of situations there.
[7526.78 --> 7527.20]  France.
[7528.06 --> 7533.40]  Let's say you're a developer for the Paris is not on fire for a change and you have other concerns.
[7533.94 --> 7535.28]  There's other stuff to work on.
[7535.66 --> 7537.42]  It doesn't smell like pee right now.
[7541.26 --> 7541.90]  Love you.
[7541.98 --> 7542.34]  Love you,
[7542.34 --> 7542.64]  France.
[7542.86 --> 7543.44]  Beautiful city.
[7545.00 --> 7545.66]  but like,
[7545.78 --> 7553.34]  it's interesting because it incentivizes you giving it a lot of information because it will work better if you do.
[7553.64 --> 7553.80]  Right.
[7554.02 --> 7554.20]  Yeah.
[7554.20 --> 7556.72]  Like it is actually a massive security problem.
[7556.86 --> 7559.80]  We talked about that on one of the first episodes.
[7559.92 --> 7561.32]  We talked about chat GPT at all,
[7561.46 --> 7562.26]  which was like,
[7562.32 --> 7562.62]  oh yeah,
[7562.72 --> 7566.84]  it can't read your internal API docs unless you give it to it.
[7566.84 --> 7567.22]  Yeah.
[7567.30 --> 7568.10]  Then it can.
[7568.84 --> 7571.22]  And like people have a hundred percent done that.
[7571.22 --> 7572.78]  I guarantee it.
[7572.78 --> 7575.54]  I know that people have done that.
[7578.24 --> 7578.88]  I don't know.
[7579.14 --> 7579.82]  It's interesting.
[7580.32 --> 7581.64]  This and the deep fake stuff.
[7581.78 --> 7582.20]  Like,
[7582.24 --> 7582.42]  yeah,
[7582.48 --> 7582.90]  we can,
[7582.90 --> 7586.48]  I've taken this stance a bunch of times on the show,
[7586.48 --> 7587.42]  which is where like,
[7587.42 --> 7588.90]  if you start banning this stuff,
[7589.44 --> 7591.48]  other countries are just going to surpass you.
[7591.58 --> 7591.90]  Like,
[7591.90 --> 7593.52]  it's not like other people aren't going to make it.
[7593.78 --> 7595.18]  So at a certain point,
[7595.20 --> 7596.12]  like what's the point?
[7596.26 --> 7599.42]  But then we have also brought up the argument of like,
[7599.66 --> 7599.92]  yeah,
[7599.92 --> 7601.38]  they were bad,
[7601.52 --> 7602.28]  which was nice.
[7602.40 --> 7605.26]  But when people deep faked us having a conversation on the WAN show,
[7605.38 --> 7606.62]  that kind of sucked.
[7607.62 --> 7611.54]  When people deep faked other people in significantly worse ways,
[7611.66 --> 7613.02]  that sucked a lot more.
[7614.70 --> 7615.10]  Like,
[7615.32 --> 7616.30]  I don't know.
[7616.32 --> 7618.20]  It's not like there isn't problems with these technologies.
[7618.84 --> 7623.96]  And if they make it so that you're only allowed to use ones that are made in country,
[7624.16 --> 7626.64]  they might be able to have more control over it.
[7626.64 --> 7631.56]  there's also the downside that that might restrict their level of innovation or whatever else,
[7631.62 --> 7632.74]  which is concerning,
[7632.92 --> 7633.64]  but I don't know.
[7633.90 --> 7637.26]  It's deep fakes AI technology.
[7637.56 --> 7637.70]  It's,
[7637.82 --> 7644.92]  it's a really interesting landscape and I can understand why different governments might react to it in a variety of different ways.
[7644.92 --> 7645.32]  Um,
[7646.02 --> 7646.34]  is,
[7646.54 --> 7648.52]  is I guess all I can say.
[7648.80 --> 7655.38]  I can run at 3,200 megahertz respectfully asks us to delineate between Parisians and the rest of the French.
[7655.38 --> 7658.46]  Parisians are specifically known to be the worst,
[7658.56 --> 7658.80]  uh,
[7658.80 --> 7659.46]  in italics.
[7659.80 --> 7660.10]  Uh,
[7660.18 --> 7660.52]  I,
[7660.68 --> 7661.34]  I don't know.
[7661.72 --> 7667.72]  This is one of those things where everyone's perception and everyone's experiences are different.
[7667.94 --> 7668.36]  You know,
[7668.42 --> 7673.44]  I hear a lot of the reputation that the French tend to have,
[7673.52 --> 7677.60]  whether we're talking Quebecois or Parisian or France,
[7677.68 --> 7678.04]  French,
[7678.16 --> 7678.66]  the rest of,
[7678.76 --> 7679.88]  the rest of France.
[7679.88 --> 7684.68]  my experience has been very overwhelmingly universally positive.
[7685.00 --> 7685.14]  Yeah.
[7685.30 --> 7686.36]  In all of those places.
[7686.36 --> 7687.84]  So I just don't really,
[7688.80 --> 7690.54]  I shouldn't say I don't really get it.
[7690.64 --> 7694.00]  I should say I can respect it because every,
[7694.28 --> 7694.72]  um,
[7695.40 --> 7699.00]  every time I've talked to anyone about it or witnessed anything,
[7699.00 --> 7704.04]  the issue they have is if you don't even make an effort to,
[7704.04 --> 7705.10]  um,
[7705.18 --> 7707.56]  engage with them on their turf in their way.
[7707.66 --> 7711.18]  So if you just walk up to someone in Montreal and speak English,
[7711.18 --> 7713.08]  where realistically,
[7713.08 --> 7714.80]  like a solid,
[7714.92 --> 7717.98]  like 75% of people speak fluent English anyway,
[7718.48 --> 7718.96]  um,
[7719.16 --> 7721.08]  they're just going to pretend they don't understand you.
[7721.16 --> 7721.72]  And,
[7721.84 --> 7722.92]  um,
[7722.92 --> 7724.46]  you can basically just off.
[7724.74 --> 7726.82]  Whereas if you walk up and you're just like,
[7726.82 --> 7728.82]  uh,
[7729.34 --> 7730.04]  toilet,
[7730.72 --> 7731.14]  uh,
[7731.28 --> 7731.54]  still,
[7732.10 --> 7732.78]  uh,
[7732.90 --> 7733.70]  there's going to be like,
[7733.76 --> 7735.00]  don't worry about it.
[7735.08 --> 7735.92]  Toilets over there.
[7736.12 --> 7736.56]  And,
[7736.64 --> 7737.02]  uh,
[7737.28 --> 7737.54]  you know,
[7737.54 --> 7739.18]  let me know if I can help you with anything when you come out,
[7739.22 --> 7740.16]  like they're chill,
[7740.28 --> 7740.72]  right?
[7740.88 --> 7741.84]  Make even,
[7741.98 --> 7743.82]  make even the slightest effort.
[7744.00 --> 7744.82]  And it's like,
[7744.82 --> 7745.36]  fine.
[7746.40 --> 7747.26]  And honestly,
[7747.36 --> 7747.92]  I can't,
[7749.36 --> 7749.56]  well,
[7749.86 --> 7750.98]  are we going to get spicy today?
[7751.10 --> 7752.84]  I can't say I don't feel the same way.
[7753.54 --> 7755.18]  Like I,
[7755.30 --> 7759.30]  I don't get running into people like in my neighborhood where I live,
[7759.30 --> 7761.64]  who don't speak a single word of English,
[7761.64 --> 7763.56]  even though they've lived here for 25 years.
[7763.68 --> 7763.98]  I have a,
[7764.38 --> 7764.72]  okay.
[7764.84 --> 7764.98]  Yeah.
[7764.98 --> 7765.66]  That's a different thing.
[7765.66 --> 7767.40]  I have a different take on that.
[7767.40 --> 7768.36]  Cause I find it fun.
[7768.50 --> 7769.36]  I've encountered it.
[7769.36 --> 7770.16]  And I'm just like,
[7770.22 --> 7771.80]  I don't like if someone,
[7771.96 --> 7774.02]  if someone speaks to you in a language that you don't understand.
[7774.02 --> 7775.48]  And I've seen this on both sides.
[7775.58 --> 7775.76]  Yeah.
[7775.92 --> 7776.20]  When,
[7776.28 --> 7778.08]  when I don't understand the,
[7778.90 --> 7779.10]  yeah,
[7779.16 --> 7779.36]  whatever.
[7779.36 --> 7780.44]  I've just seen it on both sides.
[7780.66 --> 7782.90]  But if someone speaks to you in a language that you don't understand,
[7782.90 --> 7786.20]  and then gets mad at you for not understanding it.
[7787.32 --> 7788.46]  When in that language,
[7788.78 --> 7789.12]  yeah,
[7789.12 --> 7790.16]  which is really funny.
[7790.16 --> 7793.24]  And they just like start yelling at you still in that language,
[7793.24 --> 7794.68]  assuming you're going to understand it now.
[7794.68 --> 7794.96]  It's like,
[7795.06 --> 7795.28]  bro,
[7795.38 --> 7795.58]  no,
[7795.68 --> 7796.00]  I don't,
[7796.00 --> 7797.46]  I have no idea.
[7798.76 --> 7799.24]  but yeah,
[7799.24 --> 7799.58]  like I,
[7799.62 --> 7800.32]  I was in,
[7800.42 --> 7802.00]  I'm just going to divert because I,
[7802.04 --> 7803.70]  I think we're going down a not great path.
[7803.70 --> 7804.52]  So I'm going elsewhere.
[7804.98 --> 7805.38]  Um,
[7805.58 --> 7806.24]  I was in,
[7806.36 --> 7810.22]  I was in Paris slash France because it wasn't just Paris.
[7810.60 --> 7812.42]  Visiting shadow fairly recently.
[7812.84 --> 7815.50]  And we weren't like in shadows offices the whole time.
[7815.80 --> 7817.06]  We cruised around.
[7817.14 --> 7818.52]  We're checking out different tourist destinations.
[7818.82 --> 7820.62]  We'd know different cafes doing whatever,
[7820.72 --> 7821.28]  all that kind of stuff.
[7821.40 --> 7821.88]  It was great.
[7822.00 --> 7822.72]  Everyone was really nice.
[7823.12 --> 7823.48]  I don't know.
[7823.58 --> 7824.24]  I didn't really get it.
[7825.90 --> 7830.30]  I did walk past part of the street that legitimately made me almost hurl.
[7830.48 --> 7830.72]  Oh yeah.
[7830.72 --> 7831.40]  It was just like,
[7831.44 --> 7831.60]  I mean,
[7831.62 --> 7832.28]  New York's the same.
[7832.28 --> 7837.72]  Any like big city that had a sewer designed like 300 years ago or whatever is
[7837.72 --> 7840.28]  going to be like that.
[7840.44 --> 7840.82]  Yeah.
[7841.02 --> 7842.36]  It was like brutal,
[7842.36 --> 7848.06]  but based on what people had told me earlier in that same day,
[7848.06 --> 7851.42]  I had remarked about how I was confused because it didn't smell bad at all.
[7851.46 --> 7852.02]  And I was confused.
[7852.02 --> 7853.04]  It was just very,
[7853.28 --> 7855.58]  this like one specific spot whenever we'd walk by it,
[7855.58 --> 7856.14]  it was really bad.
[7856.68 --> 7856.88]  But yeah,
[7856.94 --> 7858.58]  people were nice in Paris.
[7858.70 --> 7860.82]  People were nice in other parts of France that we went to.
[7861.04 --> 7861.92]  I had no problem with it.
[7862.04 --> 7865.68]  That might be because of like how I interacted with those people.
[7866.30 --> 7867.90]  So they were respectful back.
[7868.62 --> 7869.34]  I don't know.
[7871.48 --> 7872.26]  But yeah,
[7872.26 --> 7873.24]  I had no problem there.
[7873.30 --> 7874.14]  I thought everybody was great.
[7874.14 --> 7877.32]  Bordaga asks,
[7877.42 --> 7878.16]  is Linus a,
[7878.30 --> 7879.78]  you're an American speak English fellow?
[7879.98 --> 7880.74]  Absolutely not.
[7880.92 --> 7881.02]  A,
[7881.06 --> 7881.78]  I'm not an American.
[7882.46 --> 7883.10]  And B,
[7883.52 --> 7887.44]  it's not like the area that I live in is like,
[7887.56 --> 7888.00]  you know,
[7888.02 --> 7891.06]  a little Italy type area or anything like that.
[7891.12 --> 7891.72]  It's like,
[7892.66 --> 7894.10]  literally everything's in English.
[7894.10 --> 7897.66]  You would have to have completely inoculated yourself from anything and
[7897.66 --> 7901.52]  everything in order to not be exposed to it and to not have to use it at
[7901.52 --> 7901.78]  all.
[7902.20 --> 7902.94]  Like it's kind of,
[7902.98 --> 7903.14]  it's,
[7903.18 --> 7903.76]  it's shocking.
[7903.92 --> 7905.18]  It's like almost admirable.
[7905.52 --> 7907.28]  If I moved to Japan,
[7907.28 --> 7908.54]  I would want to learn Japanese.
[7909.48 --> 7910.76]  Whether you wanted to or not,
[7910.80 --> 7911.76]  you just probably should.
[7912.64 --> 7915.86]  It's sort of obvious to me,
[7916.00 --> 7917.08]  but fair enough.
[7917.14 --> 7917.32]  Yeah.
[7918.72 --> 7920.30]  The should just doesn't apply.
[7920.36 --> 7920.86]  Cause for me,
[7920.86 --> 7922.48]  I would want to anyways.
[7922.60 --> 7923.32]  So like it is,
[7923.32 --> 7924.08]  it's yeah,
[7924.26 --> 7925.20]  it'd be almost irrelevant.
[7927.66 --> 7929.12]  All right.
[7929.18 --> 7930.74]  Why don't we move on to YouTube?
[7931.14 --> 7935.34]  Adding dubbing podcasts and 10 80 premium.
[7937.16 --> 7939.46]  So before we get into this,
[7939.48 --> 7940.38]  I just want to shoot in.
[7940.66 --> 7943.22]  Cause I like recommend using it.
[7943.42 --> 7945.52]  I complained on the show fairly recently.
[7945.52 --> 7948.48]  I think three or four shows ago about how,
[7948.48 --> 7953.04]  despite being a premium member and despite literally every single video that I
[7953.04 --> 7956.96]  would click on manually switching it to the highest possible resolution for a
[7956.96 --> 7959.44]  long time being really diligent about it,
[7959.46 --> 7962.82]  doing every single time it was still automatically putting me at the bottom
[7962.82 --> 7963.64]  resolution forever.
[7963.80 --> 7966.70]  I complained about that while I was on the show.
[7966.78 --> 7967.92]  I had the idea of like,
[7967.96 --> 7972.86]  I should just make an extension that automatically picks the highest possible
[7972.86 --> 7973.34]  resolution.
[7973.86 --> 7976.82]  And then while I was sitting there thinking about that being like,
[7976.86 --> 7977.74]  I shouldn't announce this,
[7977.78 --> 7978.50]  I should just do it.
[7979.26 --> 7980.56]  Someone mentioned in chat,
[7980.68 --> 7980.80]  like,
[7980.86 --> 7980.98]  Hey,
[7980.98 --> 7982.96]  there's this extension that does this.
[7982.96 --> 7983.42]  And I was like,
[7983.50 --> 7984.12]  Oh sick.
[7984.42 --> 7985.14]  So I went home,
[7985.24 --> 7985.80]  checked it out,
[7985.92 --> 7986.30]  got it,
[7986.38 --> 7986.82]  installed it,
[7986.84 --> 7988.02]  and have been running it for a long time.
[7988.02 --> 7988.84]  And it's great.
[7989.14 --> 7990.92]  So mine just automatically picks his,
[7991.36 --> 7991.66]  uh,
[7991.70 --> 7993.46]  picks absolute maximum now.
[7993.56 --> 7995.30]  Cause I was like for a long time,
[7995.34 --> 7995.78]  it's just be like,
[7995.82 --> 7995.92]  Oh,
[7995.98 --> 7996.20]  whatever.
[7996.32 --> 7997.26]  Like 10 80 piece fine.
[7997.32 --> 7998.60]  I don't need to like crank everything.
[7998.60 --> 7999.24]  So crazy.
[7999.46 --> 7999.64]  Yeah,
[7999.64 --> 8000.18]  but no,
[8000.40 --> 8001.76]  they wanted a war.
[8001.88 --> 8003.38]  Now it's max every time,
[8003.44 --> 8003.70]  no matter what.
[8003.70 --> 8004.60]  They're going to get one.
[8004.70 --> 8004.90]  Yeah.
[8004.90 --> 8005.74]  Screw it.
[8007.32 --> 8007.60]  Oh,
[8008.66 --> 8009.20]  um,
[8009.20 --> 8009.98]  anyways,
[8010.16 --> 8010.86]  the actual topic.
[8011.00 --> 8012.50]  Following last week's leadership change,
[8012.56 --> 8014.40]  YouTube has announced a series of new features,
[8014.56 --> 8019.42]  including experimenting with a new 10 80 premium.
[8019.70 --> 8019.90]  Sorry.
[8020.04 --> 8020.16]  No,
[8020.20 --> 8021.50]  I was going to say 10 80 P premium,
[8021.60 --> 8025.76]  but it's 10 80 premium video quality with a higher bit rate.
[8026.32 --> 8026.54]  Uh,
[8026.54 --> 8027.52]  despite concerns,
[8027.60 --> 8032.08]  YouTube does not currently appear to intend to decrease the quality of the current 10 80 P setting,
[8032.08 --> 8032.86]  um,
[8032.86 --> 8034.84]  to encourage paying for the premium version.
[8034.84 --> 8035.46]  Uh,
[8035.46 --> 8038.94]  but the new 10 80 premium will run at 13 megabits per second.
[8038.94 --> 8042.50]  Instead of eight megabits per second with unpaid 10 80 P.
[8042.70 --> 8044.32]  I'm sure it's still variable.
[8044.78 --> 8046.18]  I think that's just like a general target.
[8046.28 --> 8046.56]  Yeah.
[8046.66 --> 8049.98]  I don't think this is just an average for the last year,
[8050.10 --> 8054.28]  a small group of creators has been testing a new dubbing system soon to roll out more broadly,
[8054.28 --> 8057.24]  which adds the option to create multiple dubbing tracks on a single video,
[8057.24 --> 8057.78]  uh,
[8057.78 --> 8059.42]  similar to the current system for subtitles,
[8059.42 --> 8062.02]  rather than having to create a different video for each language.
[8062.02 --> 8063.82]  I believe we were part of that beta.
[8064.08 --> 8065.12]  So that includes us.
[8065.22 --> 8065.62]  We have,
[8065.70 --> 8066.58]  we have tested it.
[8066.64 --> 8067.90]  I'm really excited about it.
[8067.90 --> 8068.40]  I think,
[8068.40 --> 8069.28]  uh,
[8069.36 --> 8069.56]  I,
[8069.70 --> 8071.96]  I pinged Ed about it earlier this week.
[8071.96 --> 8074.74]  And I think I was told that the,
[8074.74 --> 8080.10]  the first like integrated into the workflow video is going to be very,
[8080.28 --> 8080.96]  very soon.
[8081.04 --> 8081.86]  Let me just have a quick,
[8082.52 --> 8082.86]  you know what?
[8082.86 --> 8084.08]  I might've talked to him in person.
[8084.08 --> 8085.24]  I think it has popped in on him.
[8085.28 --> 8085.66]  So nope.
[8085.70 --> 8086.12]  I don't know.
[8086.18 --> 8087.04]  I don't have it on my,
[8087.14 --> 8087.90]  I don't have it on my phone,
[8087.98 --> 8090.04]  but I think we're going to be ready to roll out.
[8090.08 --> 8093.00]  I think we're doing Spanish first.
[8093.70 --> 8094.80]  Don't quote me on that,
[8094.80 --> 8095.12]  but I'm,
[8095.12 --> 8095.78]  I'm pretty sure.
[8095.78 --> 8098.60]  Cause that's what most of our initial testing was done on.
[8100.10 --> 8104.92]  It will also be possible to designate tracks and videos as podcasts in YouTube studio,
[8104.92 --> 8107.16]  as well as adding them to YouTube music.
[8107.28 --> 8107.42]  Oh,
[8107.50 --> 8107.74]  okay.
[8108.20 --> 8109.38]  Dan's not there.
[8110.34 --> 8110.82]  So,
[8111.20 --> 8111.58]  um,
[8111.58 --> 8113.86]  I guess I don't really know,
[8114.46 --> 8114.68]  uh,
[8114.80 --> 8115.18]  chair,
[8116.10 --> 8116.40]  uh,
[8116.48 --> 8116.78]  chair,
[8116.92 --> 8117.66]  secret labs chair.
[8117.82 --> 8118.02]  Nope.
[8118.14 --> 8119.86]  I guess he didn't make it in time.
[8120.28 --> 8120.76]  Uh,
[8120.76 --> 8122.00]  we're done having this conversation.
[8122.16 --> 8122.30]  Sorry.
[8122.58 --> 8126.62]  Do you have any idea how our podcast platform uploads work?
[8126.68 --> 8127.76]  Cause I don't even know.
[8128.12 --> 8131.00]  I have recently found out because we didn't know.
[8131.26 --> 8131.38]  Yeah.
[8131.42 --> 8131.70]  Uh,
[8131.70 --> 8134.58]  so podcast uploads are handled by Sven.
[8135.50 --> 8136.58]  That's random.
[8137.36 --> 8137.98]  Very random.
[8138.30 --> 8138.48]  Yeah.
[8138.48 --> 8140.58]  This is probably going to change.
[8141.58 --> 8142.06]  Yeah.
[8142.08 --> 8143.36]  That doesn't make any sense.
[8143.58 --> 8143.76]  Yeah.
[8143.86 --> 8144.06]  I,
[8144.16 --> 8145.64]  I only just learned this.
[8145.72 --> 8145.98]  Oh,
[8146.08 --> 8146.48]  okay.
[8148.20 --> 8149.24]  We're looking into it.
[8149.30 --> 8150.24]  There might be some reasons,
[8150.46 --> 8151.12]  stuff like that,
[8151.14 --> 8152.82]  but it's also like not automated.
[8153.06 --> 8154.12]  Reasons like that.
[8154.12 --> 8158.32]  We rolled a 106 sided die and it landed on Sven.
[8158.50 --> 8158.58]  Like,
[8158.58 --> 8160.64]  I think you have been chosen.
[8160.84 --> 8164.04]  I think maybe things like Spotify.
[8164.04 --> 8165.36]  You are the 1%.
[8165.36 --> 8171.20]  I think maybe things like Spotify might get different ads than other platforms.
[8171.20 --> 8171.72]  That's correct.
[8171.82 --> 8171.96]  Yeah.
[8171.96 --> 8174.26]  There are specific ad reads for Spotify.
[8174.26 --> 8179.76]  And then because our ad reads are a variable length and at variable points in the video.
[8179.90 --> 8180.52]  I see.
[8180.58 --> 8181.60]  It can't be automated.
[8181.60 --> 8183.38]  It's just whenever I feel like doing it.
[8183.84 --> 8185.10]  And also for a different amount of time,
[8185.16 --> 8185.28]  right?
[8185.30 --> 8185.70]  Cause you don't,
[8185.80 --> 8186.54]  you wouldn't do it for like,
[8186.68 --> 8186.92]  okay,
[8186.92 --> 8189.46]  for the exact next 90 seconds,
[8189.46 --> 8191.36]  no matter what we are doing an ad,
[8191.46 --> 8192.84]  like a section of ads,
[8192.94 --> 8194.74]  like it's not structured like that.
[8194.92 --> 8195.24]  Right.
[8195.34 --> 8199.32]  So you can't really automate it.
[8199.34 --> 8200.74]  So that means if there's a long weekend,
[8200.74 --> 8204.62]  it's not going to be up on podcasting platforms until Tuesday,
[8205.02 --> 8208.50]  by which point you might as well just start watching clips because you know,
[8208.50 --> 8211.04]  who has time to watch like a four hour podcast.
[8211.04 --> 8215.00]  So we're like hyper hamstringing our own podcast.
[8215.32 --> 8215.42]  Yeah.
[8215.44 --> 8219.76]  It's kind of hilarious how WAN show is as far as I can tell,
[8219.84 --> 8221.78]  actually an enormous podcast.
[8221.92 --> 8222.16]  Yeah.
[8222.46 --> 8225.32]  And yet we do everything we can to make,
[8225.74 --> 8228.06]  try to make it to impede its success.
[8228.18 --> 8228.52]  Yeah.
[8229.58 --> 8230.02]  Yeah.
[8232.34 --> 8233.14]  I don't know,
[8233.20 --> 8233.40]  man.
[8233.44 --> 8234.94]  I put these wrinkles here on purpose.
[8235.08 --> 8235.82]  You guys know that,
[8235.90 --> 8236.10]  right?
[8236.10 --> 8239.58]  Oh yeah.
[8239.74 --> 8240.22]  It's brutal.
[8240.84 --> 8241.50]  But yeah,
[8241.62 --> 8241.78]  I,
[8241.94 --> 8244.38]  I think the irreverence is why they like it.
[8245.52 --> 8248.48]  I want it to be automated in some way.
[8248.58 --> 8249.22]  It's a feature.
[8249.40 --> 8253.40]  I just don't know if it can be because of how we structure the ad spots.
[8253.58 --> 8255.18]  Unless we started doing like,
[8255.28 --> 8256.22]  we have the timer,
[8256.32 --> 8256.52]  right?
[8256.62 --> 8257.70]  So unless we started doing,
[8257.80 --> 8257.94]  okay,
[8258.04 --> 8258.58]  there's the,
[8258.98 --> 8264.96]  but there's some amount of variance in the recording start in the recording
[8264.96 --> 8265.26]  end.
[8265.26 --> 8266.72]  So it's always going to be a little odd.
[8266.84 --> 8270.40]  I don't know if there's some way where we could automatically splice out.
[8270.48 --> 8274.22]  If we started being really rigid about the duration of ad spots and when we did
[8274.22 --> 8275.08]  them and stuff like that.
[8275.36 --> 8275.46]  Yeah.
[8275.46 --> 8276.44]  But we don't want to do that.
[8276.54 --> 8277.44]  So like it,
[8277.44 --> 8278.34]  it keeps coming back to,
[8278.44 --> 8279.06]  if we want to have,
[8279.06 --> 8281.48]  is this the word we to mean Linus?
[8282.00 --> 8282.36]  Yeah.
[8283.16 --> 8283.76]  If we,
[8284.18 --> 8286.40]  you used it after a while.
[8287.04 --> 8287.40]  If,
[8287.56 --> 8289.02]  if you,
[8289.16 --> 8291.60]  Hey,
[8291.64 --> 8292.98]  I stopped signing things for you.
[8293.42 --> 8293.66]  Is that,
[8293.66 --> 8301.48]  have you though?
[8302.62 --> 8302.98]  Yeah.
[8302.98 --> 8306.92]  Because now I can just sign things as myself on behalf of the company.
[8307.04 --> 8307.50]  We just,
[8307.58 --> 8308.50]  we just changed that.
[8308.50 --> 8309.24]  Um,
[8310.20 --> 8310.50]  uh,
[8310.50 --> 8311.16]  what was I going to say?
[8311.20 --> 8312.68]  I'm not hearing any of this.
[8313.64 --> 8313.82]  Uh,
[8314.78 --> 8315.10]  but yeah,
[8315.10 --> 8316.90]  if we want to have custom ads on those platforms,
[8316.90 --> 8318.16]  it's going to have to be manual to,
[8318.24 --> 8318.82]  to,
[8318.94 --> 8319.68]  to some degree.
[8320.22 --> 8320.58]  Um,
[8322.24 --> 8322.48]  yeah.
[8322.96 --> 8324.36]  Dark 24 says,
[8324.36 --> 8325.20]  no Linus,
[8325.38 --> 8327.14]  it is not why we like it.
[8327.36 --> 8331.64]  Some of us tolerate it because nothing will change no matter what we say.
[8332.00 --> 8333.84]  You being a troll is not funny.
[8333.84 --> 8334.14]  Yeah.
[8335.56 --> 8337.04]  Why am I laughing then?
[8341.12 --> 8341.76]  Oh man.
[8341.76 --> 8342.22]  Oh no.
[8342.42 --> 8343.84]  Casual forgery on the WAN show.
[8343.90 --> 8344.32]  It's been,
[8344.38 --> 8345.30]  it's been enough time.
[8345.40 --> 8346.14]  Statue of limitations,
[8346.30 --> 8346.50]  whatever.
[8347.94 --> 8349.42]  I don't think a week counts.
[8350.10 --> 8350.50]  Hey,
[8350.66 --> 8351.18]  come on.
[8353.70 --> 8354.64]  Oh geez.
[8354.92 --> 8355.66]  Sign my screwdriver.
[8355.66 --> 8356.06]  Yeah.
[8356.22 --> 8356.80]  At LTX,
[8356.84 --> 8358.56]  I'll sign everyone's stuff as Linus.
[8358.76 --> 8359.42]  There we go.
[8360.58 --> 8360.90]  Oh,
[8360.96 --> 8361.48]  I'm sorry.
[8361.66 --> 8361.94]  Okay.
[8362.10 --> 8362.30]  Yeah.
[8362.32 --> 8362.86]  I'm doing great.
[8362.86 --> 8363.30]  Uh,
[8363.30 --> 8363.86]  uh,
[8363.86 --> 8367.86]  um,
[8370.42 --> 8370.86]  okay.
[8373.74 --> 8373.94]  Uh,
[8373.98 --> 8376.56]  LTX 2023 BYOC update.
[8376.68 --> 8376.80]  Hey,
[8376.86 --> 8377.74]  speaking of LTX,
[8377.82 --> 8378.68]  what a great segue.
[8379.08 --> 8379.32]  Yeah.
[8379.40 --> 8379.72]  Um,
[8379.90 --> 8383.16]  we know not everyone was able to get a whale land BYOC ticket,
[8383.16 --> 8385.32]  but we were able to shuffle the layout a bit.
[8385.32 --> 8389.06]  And we're selling more to 38 more tickets.
[8390.18 --> 8390.74]  That's it.
[8391.50 --> 8394.20]  We sold all of them in like the first day.
[8394.82 --> 8396.12]  That's going to do nothing.
[8396.74 --> 8397.14]  Uh,
[8397.26 --> 8397.62]  I mean,
[8397.76 --> 8398.38]  okay.
[8398.46 --> 8398.70]  Look,
[8398.74 --> 8401.56]  the thing is we can't take up the whole floor plan with BYOC.
[8402.82 --> 8404.30]  Otherwise it wouldn't be LTX.
[8404.34 --> 8405.48]  It would just be whale land.
[8405.58 --> 8405.68]  Yeah.
[8405.68 --> 8407.94]  There needs to be like fun things to do at the convention.
[8408.42 --> 8408.62]  Yeah.
[8408.68 --> 8409.88]  And so it's,
[8409.94 --> 8410.80]  it's a balancing act,
[8410.84 --> 8410.98]  right?
[8410.98 --> 8411.58]  So I get it.
[8411.58 --> 8412.32]  But anyway,
[8412.62 --> 8415.30]  I think at some point we're going to get to a point where we're
[8415.30 --> 8417.34]  the BYOC gets like its own floor.
[8417.74 --> 8417.88]  Yeah.
[8418.22 --> 8420.06]  Vancouver convention center has multiple buildings.
[8420.36 --> 8420.50]  Yeah.
[8420.62 --> 8422.52]  So the BYOC could just have its own thing.
[8422.66 --> 8422.86]  Totally.
[8422.98 --> 8424.74]  And you could be in BYOC land,
[8424.82 --> 8426.72]  which would actually be great for security anyway.
[8426.92 --> 8427.04]  Yep.
[8427.12 --> 8428.20]  So you're in BYOC land.
[8428.20 --> 8431.04]  And then you just walk across like this little courtyard or like
[8431.04 --> 8432.26]  external plaza thing.
[8432.26 --> 8433.52]  And then you're in the other building.
[8433.62 --> 8434.14]  You're in LTX.
[8434.14 --> 8434.38]  Cause I mean,
[8434.46 --> 8435.78]  I could see us getting there.
[8436.06 --> 8436.16]  Yeah.
[8436.58 --> 8439.06]  LTX is like kind of awesome.
[8439.44 --> 8442.58]  So at least the last one was presumably this next one will be good.
[8443.20 --> 8443.64]  Um,
[8444.36 --> 8444.64]  yeah.
[8444.84 --> 8448.94]  Assuming it continues to grow at the pace that it has been over the last
[8448.94 --> 8449.52]  two.
[8449.52 --> 8451.98]  And then what looks like it's going to happen for this next one.
[8451.98 --> 8453.44]  It could be like a 10,
[8453.62 --> 8454.08]  15,
[8454.22 --> 8456.78]  20,000 person convention by like 2025,
[8456.98 --> 8457.62]  2026.
[8457.78 --> 8458.50]  Like it's,
[8458.60 --> 8459.96]  it's pretty exciting.
[8460.16 --> 8460.42]  It's,
[8460.46 --> 8461.16]  it's really cool.
[8461.54 --> 8461.94]  Anyway,
[8462.30 --> 8462.76]  um,
[8462.80 --> 8463.60]  BYOC tickets,
[8463.80 --> 8464.58]  those 38,
[8464.58 --> 8465.68]  uh,
[8465.68 --> 8470.40]  will go on sale March 3rd at 5 PM Pacific time.
[8471.12 --> 8474.38]  So if you didn't get a BYOC ticket and you're into it,
[8474.48 --> 8474.96]  um,
[8475.00 --> 8475.54]  go for it.
[8475.92 --> 8476.30]  Uh,
[8476.30 --> 8478.10]  there's some notes in here for LTX 2019.
[8478.10 --> 8482.12]  We apparently made the mistake of opening up too many more BYOC seats at
[8482.12 --> 8482.40]  once.
[8482.46 --> 8483.36]  So we'll be offering,
[8483.44 --> 8483.52]  Oh,
[8483.56 --> 8486.68]  there'll be several waves of small batch tickets provided that we sell out
[8486.68 --> 8487.08]  each wave.
[8487.46 --> 8487.78]  Um,
[8487.78 --> 8490.46]  so if you already have a ticket and want to purchase BYOC instead,
[8490.72 --> 8491.80]  please just do so.
[8491.84 --> 8494.72]  And then reach out to support at info at LTX expo.com.
[8494.72 --> 8496.64]  So we can refund your original ticket.
[8497.22 --> 8497.78]  All right,
[8497.86 --> 8498.08]  cool.
[8498.16 --> 8498.68]  So that way you will,
[8498.78 --> 8501.14]  if you like had any extras on your original ticket or whatever,
[8501.14 --> 8502.06]  we can get you sorted out.
[8503.04 --> 8504.84]  Should we do a few merch messages?
[8505.30 --> 8505.46]  Yeah.
[8505.60 --> 8505.74]  Oh,
[8505.78 --> 8507.68]  Google was accused of destroying evidence.
[8507.68 --> 8508.66]  We could talk about that.
[8509.14 --> 8509.54]  Um,
[8509.70 --> 8509.86]  blah,
[8509.90 --> 8510.08]  blah,
[8510.22 --> 8510.48]  blah.
[8510.64 --> 8516.76]  They were accused of destroying evidence by the American government.
[8520.84 --> 8524.46]  Something antitrust Epic games.
[8524.92 --> 8526.46]  This is a real podcast.
[8531.08 --> 8531.90]  I mean,
[8532.08 --> 8533.96]  the headline kind of says it all.
[8534.30 --> 8534.98]  That's okay.
[8535.08 --> 8536.98]  That's what I was saying about the topics for this week though.
[8536.98 --> 8538.02]  They're just like legal stuff,
[8538.26 --> 8539.54]  which nothing else happened.
[8539.70 --> 8542.44]  Blue Origin can make solar panels out of moon dust.
[8542.74 --> 8544.44]  All they have to do is go to the moon.
[8544.44 --> 8557.98]  They hope to market this innovation to NASA.
[8559.30 --> 8559.82]  Cool.
[8562.34 --> 8565.24]  Maybe they'll win something from NASA that SpaceX doesn't get.
[8565.40 --> 8565.76]  All right,
[8565.82 --> 8567.02]  let's do some merch messages.
[8567.02 --> 8568.26]  Okay.
[8568.26 --> 8568.54]  Sure.
[8568.54 --> 8568.76]  We,
[8568.76 --> 8569.10]  uh,
[8569.10 --> 8570.10]  we've got one here from Kira.
[8570.68 --> 8570.98]  Uh,
[8570.98 --> 8571.60]  happy Friday.
[8571.94 --> 8572.20]  Yeah.
[8572.24 --> 8572.94]  Happy Friday.
[8573.22 --> 8573.44]  Hey,
[8573.78 --> 8576.08]  would you say in the programming world,
[8576.14 --> 8579.96]  it's more important to be an expert in one language or proficient in many?
[8580.08 --> 8583.04]  Do you have a favorite slash least favorite language?
[8583.20 --> 8583.48]  Oh,
[8583.98 --> 8584.48]  uh,
[8584.48 --> 8585.72]  I think it all depends on what you're doing.
[8586.30 --> 8586.74]  Um,
[8586.82 --> 8587.70]  like there's,
[8587.84 --> 8598.98]  there's people that get paid a lot to be extremely knowledgeable in like a very old antiquated language that no one learns anymore,
[8598.98 --> 8601.88]  but like airports or,
[8602.04 --> 8602.30]  yeah,
[8602.50 --> 8606.80]  or nuclear silos or heavy industry or whatever still uses it.
[8606.80 --> 8613.40]  And they need you to come make some change to it like once a year and they'll pay you like literally,
[8613.40 --> 8616.72]  I have heard of contracts where someone flies in,
[8617.00 --> 8619.92]  works for like one to five days,
[8620.34 --> 8622.46]  flies out and gets paid 200 grand.
[8624.32 --> 8626.28]  You just have to hope that comes along.
[8626.56 --> 8628.66]  You need to be the best one.
[8629.04 --> 8630.94]  You have to hope it comes along.
[8630.94 --> 8632.96]  Cause this isn't going to be like a perpetual thing.
[8633.00 --> 8633.92]  It's just gonna be a one-time thing.
[8633.92 --> 8637.30]  I'm not actually saying this is like necessarily a good career path.
[8637.86 --> 8638.22]  Yeah.
[8638.32 --> 8638.54]  Right.
[8638.68 --> 8639.30]  To be clear.
[8639.68 --> 8641.96]  But I know that there are people that do it.
[8642.20 --> 8642.64]  It's like,
[8642.68 --> 8643.58]  you can just say cobalt.
[8643.66 --> 8644.32]  That's yeah.
[8644.34 --> 8645.04]  That's one of them.
[8645.12 --> 8646.02]  There are others as well.
[8646.14 --> 8646.62]  So like,
[8646.66 --> 8651.86]  that's a situation where being an expert in one language would be good.
[8652.76 --> 8653.12]  Uh,
[8653.12 --> 8657.40]  being proficient in many though has some other aspects of it that might be good.
[8657.40 --> 8659.38]  Like I'm assuming if you're proficient in many,
[8659.46 --> 8661.46]  that means that you're actively learning.
[8661.46 --> 8665.44]  And if you're trying to stay with the trend of technology,
[8665.44 --> 8667.28]  the current like language,
[8667.28 --> 8671.70]  that's going to be the best at doing whatever is basically constantly changing.
[8672.04 --> 8673.74]  So if you're only an expert in one,
[8673.80 --> 8674.06]  you're like,
[8674.18 --> 8674.42]  no,
[8674.74 --> 8675.92]  this is the only one I learned.
[8676.00 --> 8676.10]  Well,
[8676.10 --> 8679.78]  you're just going to fall behind and you either luckily become that like one
[8679.78 --> 8682.20]  cobalt guy that gets paid 200 grand to do the thing,
[8682.20 --> 8683.34]  or you don't.
[8683.38 --> 8684.54]  And then you just don't have a job.
[8684.54 --> 8685.24]  So like,
[8686.44 --> 8687.16]  I don't know.
[8687.46 --> 8687.90]  Um,
[8687.96 --> 8688.68]  do you have favorite,
[8688.80 --> 8689.76]  least favorite language?
[8689.98 --> 8690.72]  Not really.
[8691.10 --> 8691.50]  Um,
[8692.60 --> 8693.52]  I really like C.
[8693.52 --> 8694.20]  He hates French.
[8695.90 --> 8697.28]  I do actually really hate French.
[8698.10 --> 8698.88]  Such a hater.
[8699.38 --> 8699.82]  Literal,
[8699.92 --> 8700.60]  literal hater.
[8701.36 --> 8702.26]  Not France,
[8702.38 --> 8702.94]  but French.
[8703.24 --> 8703.36]  I,
[8703.42 --> 8703.64]  I,
[8703.74 --> 8706.70]  I even like hearing people speak French and stuff is fine,
[8706.70 --> 8707.12]  but I just,
[8707.40 --> 8708.34]  when I was learning it in school,
[8708.34 --> 8709.18]  I did not like it.
[8709.18 --> 8709.90]  Um,
[8710.58 --> 8711.04]  but yeah,
[8711.04 --> 8711.66]  I like C.
[8711.90 --> 8712.66]  I like to see a lot,
[8712.96 --> 8715.94]  which might come as a surprise,
[8716.14 --> 8716.76]  but yeah.
[8718.62 --> 8719.02]  Okay.
[8719.08 --> 8719.28]  Uh,
[8719.28 --> 8720.32]  this one's from anonymous.
[8720.70 --> 8720.84]  Hello,
[8720.96 --> 8724.58]  Linus and Luke was just wondering if either of you have watched Jeff
[8724.58 --> 8725.48]  gearlings,
[8725.70 --> 8729.34]  six month review of the screwdriver and what your thoughts are on it.
[8729.48 --> 8729.62]  No,
[8729.66 --> 8730.46]  but I read the comments.
[8731.74 --> 8732.42]  I'm serious.
[8732.50 --> 8733.30]  That's it's,
[8733.52 --> 8734.24]  I'm not gonna,
[8734.24 --> 8736.38]  I'm not gonna dance around it.
[8736.44 --> 8736.98]  That's what I do.
[8737.60 --> 8737.96]  Um,
[8738.36 --> 8738.80]  I,
[8738.80 --> 8743.54]  I am glad that he has had an overall positive experience with the
[8743.54 --> 8743.98]  screwdriver.
[8744.54 --> 8745.02]  Um,
[8745.36 --> 8749.68]  as a YouTuber who sort of understands how retention curves work and
[8749.68 --> 8750.08]  how,
[8750.08 --> 8750.84]  uh,
[8750.84 --> 8752.24]  consumption of,
[8752.36 --> 8755.98]  of media through headlines works as,
[8756.14 --> 8756.30]  uh,
[8756.34 --> 8756.78]  as a,
[8756.78 --> 8757.26]  as a,
[8757.26 --> 8760.62]  as a king tier consumer of media through headlines.
[8760.92 --> 8761.44]  Um,
[8761.88 --> 8767.06]  I can't say that I'm stoked that the thumbnail and title focused on
[8767.06 --> 8768.68]  it breaking when actually,
[8768.68 --> 8770.60]  if you make it like quite deep into the video,
[8770.68 --> 8772.72]  it turns out he like broke it on purpose.
[8773.42 --> 8773.86]  Um,
[8774.16 --> 8775.02]  so it's kind of like,
[8775.16 --> 8778.16]  a lot of people are only going to see that.
[8778.16 --> 8779.80]  And I understand what your point was.
[8779.80 --> 8780.38]  It was,
[8780.46 --> 8780.84]  um,
[8781.10 --> 8781.44]  you know,
[8781.44 --> 8784.36]  like a multi-layered sort of,
[8784.42 --> 8785.24]  um,
[8786.24 --> 8787.60]  critique of,
[8787.60 --> 8788.04]  of,
[8788.04 --> 8788.06]  of,
[8788.06 --> 8788.66]  of the,
[8788.66 --> 8789.52]  of the,
[8789.52 --> 8789.54]  of the,
[8789.54 --> 8791.34]  the average YouTube viewers,
[8791.34 --> 8791.94]  uh,
[8791.94 --> 8794.46]  tendency to not watch the whole video,
[8794.46 --> 8795.60]  but like,
[8796.12 --> 8799.84]  since we all know that,
[8799.84 --> 8801.88]  and since we're not going to change that,
[8801.88 --> 8802.64]  um,
[8802.70 --> 8804.38]  now a lot of people are just like,
[8804.38 --> 8805.64]  LTT screwdriver broke.
[8805.64 --> 8806.04]  And it's like,
[8806.10 --> 8806.38]  okay,
[8806.38 --> 8806.70]  cool.
[8807.16 --> 8807.56]  Um,
[8807.56 --> 8809.32]  so that is not the best,
[8809.66 --> 8809.86]  but,
[8810.00 --> 8810.36]  um,
[8812.06 --> 8812.30]  yeah,
[8812.30 --> 8814.16]  I'm glad he likes it.
[8815.00 --> 8815.40]  Yeah.
[8815.60 --> 8815.96]  Fair enough.
[8817.36 --> 8817.76]  Okay.
[8817.76 --> 8818.72]  This one's from Austin.
[8818.90 --> 8821.22]  What is your favorite LTX 19 moment?
[8821.52 --> 8823.72]  Mine was when I got to chat with Linus for a second,
[8823.72 --> 8825.96]  and he told me the name of a banger pizza plates,
[8826.40 --> 8827.26]  D plus pizza.
[8827.50 --> 8828.12]  D hot,
[8828.24 --> 8828.92]  I think actually,
[8829.08 --> 8829.48]  but yes,
[8829.54 --> 8830.02]  close enough.
[8831.98 --> 8832.26]  Uh,
[8832.28 --> 8834.60]  D plus pizza is a completely different thing.
[8834.66 --> 8835.80]  I think that guy got arrested.
[8839.24 --> 8839.60]  I,
[8839.74 --> 8840.12]  uh,
[8840.36 --> 8841.42]  we don't know what I'm talking about.
[8841.42 --> 8841.62]  No,
[8841.68 --> 8842.40]  I don't.
[8842.40 --> 8843.14]  The guy who,
[8843.14 --> 8843.54]  uh,
[8843.54 --> 8843.94]  you know,
[8844.32 --> 8845.24]  on the pizza.
[8845.54 --> 8846.54]  I didn't know what that was.
[8846.54 --> 8846.84]  Oh yeah.
[8846.92 --> 8847.34]  That's a thing.
[8847.76 --> 8848.08]  Oh yeah.
[8848.08 --> 8848.42]  That's,
[8848.64 --> 8849.16]  that's,
[8849.24 --> 8849.96]  you don't want that pizza.
[8850.12 --> 8850.24]  No,
[8850.28 --> 8851.24]  you don't.
[8851.40 --> 8851.72]  Uh,
[8851.84 --> 8852.82]  when you and I,
[8852.94 --> 8855.66]  I don't know if we like ran the line or just walked the line,
[8855.76 --> 8858.06]  but when people are lining up to get inside,
[8858.38 --> 8860.00]  you came and grabbed me and you're like,
[8860.06 --> 8861.62]  let's like go to the end.
[8861.72 --> 8862.02]  Yeah.
[8862.18 --> 8862.88]  And then it was like,
[8862.98 --> 8863.66]  holy.
[8863.96 --> 8864.12]  Yeah,
[8864.12 --> 8864.58]  that was fun.
[8864.66 --> 8865.26]  When is his end?
[8865.38 --> 8866.16]  That was really cool.
[8866.22 --> 8866.40]  You know,
[8866.40 --> 8868.20]  the line is going to be like twice as long this time,
[8868.20 --> 8868.36]  right?
[8868.78 --> 8870.04]  Let's go for a run.
[8870.18 --> 8870.44]  Yeah.
[8870.68 --> 8870.92]  Yeah.
[8873.56 --> 8873.92]  Okay.
[8873.92 --> 8874.70]  This one's from Jackson.
[8875.04 --> 8875.36]  Hi,
[8875.54 --> 8875.96]  Linus,
[8876.04 --> 8876.16]  Luke,
[8876.18 --> 8876.56]  and Dan,
[8876.56 --> 8881.74]  I'm an avid car enthusiast and wanted your opinion slash thoughts on why auto manufacturers
[8881.74 --> 8885.62]  give zero Fs on upgrading the electronics in cars,
[8886.02 --> 8888.46]  infotainment centers in particular.
[8888.46 --> 8889.86]  because Fs you.
[8890.20 --> 8890.80]  That's why.
[8891.12 --> 8892.00]  It's a lot cheaper to not.
[8892.02 --> 8893.28]  Because you'll buy it anyway,
[8893.44 --> 8894.42]  you piece of s**t.
[8894.52 --> 8898.26]  Being on super old processes is like genuinely way cheaper.
[8898.62 --> 8899.02]  And,
[8899.08 --> 8899.42]  uh,
[8899.42 --> 8901.66]  actually can have reliability advantages.
[8902.02 --> 8902.36]  That too.
[8902.50 --> 8902.82]  Um,
[8902.82 --> 8905.06]  but the main reason,
[8905.42 --> 8907.38]  the main primary reason,
[8907.38 --> 8908.38]  um,
[8908.38 --> 8910.18]  is because just,
[8910.34 --> 8912.74]  they don't want to change their technology.
[8912.88 --> 8916.10]  They just have stuff that works for them and they just keep doing it.
[8916.10 --> 8922.00]  I also honestly think most people don't really care that much.
[8922.28 --> 8922.56]  Yeah.
[8922.56 --> 8922.80]  Well,
[8922.88 --> 8924.24]  the thing is that it bothers them,
[8924.32 --> 8925.16]  but they'll buy it anyway.
[8925.44 --> 8925.52]  Yeah.
[8925.52 --> 8927.60]  And as long as that continues to happen,
[8927.78 --> 8928.88]  then I,
[8928.96 --> 8929.34]  I mean,
[8929.36 --> 8935.64]  that's one of the things that I was most supportive of Tesla about their better infotainment systems.
[8935.66 --> 8936.28]  They pushed it pretty hard.
[8936.40 --> 8936.76]  Um,
[8936.76 --> 8943.62]  that I think have put a significant amount of pressure on the legacy automakers to build better infotainment systems.
[8943.62 --> 8944.52]  At the same time,
[8944.92 --> 8948.62]  Google and Apple pushed CarPlay and Android Auto forward,
[8948.62 --> 8952.24]  which has been just enormous for me.
[8952.24 --> 8958.60]  The last thing that I ever had any care for was updating the stupid integrated map,
[8958.84 --> 8963.42]  stupid integrated navigation garbage in my stupid car.
[8963.88 --> 8965.56]  Take it to a dealer to get a new map.
[8965.66 --> 8967.12]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[8967.36 --> 8967.58]  Like,
[8967.68 --> 8967.94]  no.
[8968.50 --> 8968.86]  Um,
[8968.94 --> 8970.10]  I like on principle,
[8970.10 --> 8971.62]  I don't even want your new map.
[8971.68 --> 8973.58]  I don't even care if it's free.
[8973.76 --> 8974.54]  I don't want it.
[8974.60 --> 8975.22]  It's stupid.
[8975.82 --> 8976.46]  I have a data.
[8976.46 --> 8982.22]  I have a computer in my pocket that has a permanent data connection that already takes all my information anywhere.
[8982.24 --> 8986.04]  So it might as well just go to them instead of you and them.
[8986.56 --> 8986.78]  Um,
[8986.78 --> 8987.22]  so anyway,
[8987.44 --> 8987.92]  I'm,
[8988.02 --> 8989.04]  I'm a huge,
[8989.16 --> 8997.90]  huge fan of being able to just set my infotainment system to not use the OEM software and just use my phone.
[8997.90 --> 8998.58]  And it's great,
[8998.78 --> 9000.08]  which by the way,
[9000.66 --> 9001.22]  um,
[9001.22 --> 9001.44]  um,
[9002.44 --> 9005.08]  I figured out that issue with the navigation.
[9005.42 --> 9007.12]  So it just changed the defaults.
[9007.38 --> 9007.48]  There,
[9007.58 --> 9011.08]  there is a setting in Android auto that I didn't notice the first time that brings,
[9011.30 --> 9011.42]  that,
[9011.42 --> 9011.82]  uh,
[9011.82 --> 9014.28]  restores that bottom navigation bar that shows you,
[9014.34 --> 9014.92]  uh,
[9014.94 --> 9015.20]  your,
[9015.30 --> 9018.24]  your previously opened app and has controls or it has your turn by turn.
[9018.72 --> 9019.08]  Um,
[9019.18 --> 9020.50]  super glitch and Twitch says,
[9020.56 --> 9021.62]  this is super wrong.
[9021.72 --> 9024.64]  The life cycle of a car is five to seven years started before they're released.
[9024.76 --> 9025.88]  You are super wrong.
[9025.88 --> 9027.12]  That's actually not the reason.
[9027.60 --> 9027.88]  Um,
[9027.88 --> 9031.06]  and you can kind of look into why the Silicon shortage,
[9031.18 --> 9041.78]  the great Silicon shortage of the Corona virus pandemic affected the auto industry more than just about any other industry and affected the legacy automakers more than Tesla,
[9041.78 --> 9043.96]  who actually uses modern technology in their cars.
[9044.44 --> 9044.66]  Uh,
[9044.66 --> 9047.06]  the reason is that they are supply constrained.
[9047.58 --> 9047.94]  Um,
[9049.00 --> 9049.26]  uh,
[9049.34 --> 9049.84]  uh,
[9049.84 --> 9055.86]  semiconductor manufacturers want to move on from these ancient processes and they just don't want to redesign things.
[9055.88 --> 9057.02]  I've heard horror stories,
[9057.02 --> 9057.82]  uh,
[9057.84 --> 9059.22]  from like small,
[9059.40 --> 9061.60]  small design teams that are like,
[9061.66 --> 9061.92]  yeah,
[9062.12 --> 9062.54]  um,
[9062.70 --> 9071.58]  literally the problem is that the one person who designed that board doesn't work here anymore and nobody else knows how to like make one.
[9071.66 --> 9073.60]  So we keep using the same board.
[9074.32 --> 9075.54]  Oh man.
[9075.92 --> 9076.12]  That,
[9076.12 --> 9076.66]  that happens.
[9076.76 --> 9077.14]  Kills me.
[9077.20 --> 9079.38]  You lose a lot of knowledge when you lose certain members of teams.
[9079.56 --> 9080.18]  Check this out.
[9081.24 --> 9083.46]  This is how you update the maps for my car.
[9084.14 --> 9086.58]  That is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
[9086.86 --> 9088.46]  You buy a $180 DVD.
[9090.36 --> 9093.40]  Don't forget about the $32 shipping for a DVD,
[9093.58 --> 9096.80]  which makes a ton of sense in the age of broadband internet.
[9097.48 --> 9098.82]  It's so annoying.
[9099.62 --> 9100.14]  Actually,
[9100.24 --> 9101.70]  like I've known about this.
[9101.82 --> 9103.94]  I have obviously never updated the maps,
[9104.16 --> 9105.56]  but I've known about this the whole time.
[9105.72 --> 9106.60]  I should check.
[9106.98 --> 9107.74]  You should pirate it.
[9107.74 --> 9113.96]  I should check if other people are privateering this software just out of curiosity.
[9114.64 --> 9115.16]  I mean,
[9115.16 --> 9116.88]  I already said you should pirate it.
[9116.94 --> 9119.32]  I don't think you really need to beat around the bush at this point.
[9123.52 --> 9124.22]  There's gotta be,
[9124.28 --> 9128.06]  there's gotta be like an entire like private tracker or something for that.
[9128.06 --> 9129.10]  You know,
[9129.18 --> 9134.10]  people can be shockingly dedicated to shockingly specific causes.
[9134.70 --> 9139.36]  I should look into this because apparently that was the last year that they were going to do it for that vehicle as well.
[9139.44 --> 9140.26]  So it'd be 2021.
[9140.56 --> 9142.56]  That's another fantastically stupid thing.
[9142.64 --> 9142.76]  Yeah.
[9142.80 --> 9148.70]  I really want something that will just stop getting updated at some point when you arbitrarily decide there's not enough,
[9149.22 --> 9152.10]  this particular vehicle left on the road that,
[9152.20 --> 9152.84]  that makes,
[9153.00 --> 9154.10]  that makes such sense.
[9154.18 --> 9154.48]  It's good.
[9154.62 --> 9155.00]  It's great.
[9155.00 --> 9155.40]  Yeah.
[9155.40 --> 9161.12]  It might as well ship on a floppy disk.
[9162.04 --> 9162.34]  Yeah.
[9163.08 --> 9164.06]  Would have been cooler.
[9166.30 --> 9166.78]  Okay.
[9166.80 --> 9167.78]  This one's from Thomas.
[9168.20 --> 9168.32]  Hey,
[9168.40 --> 9168.94]  Linus and Luke.
[9169.02 --> 9170.12]  I've been buying some products,
[9170.24 --> 9172.92]  both physical and digital to help my productivity.
[9173.22 --> 9178.30]  What consumer grade products in the last five to 10 years have aided your productivity the most?
[9180.12 --> 9181.24]  Consumer products.
[9182.20 --> 9182.64]  Man,
[9182.64 --> 9183.96]  I like having a big monitor.
[9184.08 --> 9185.00]  I was going to say monitors.
[9185.00 --> 9185.80]  I like my,
[9185.80 --> 9186.72]  my quadrants.
[9186.86 --> 9188.74]  I have four 1080p screens,
[9188.84 --> 9190.50]  each of which is 21 inches,
[9190.50 --> 9193.82]  which is like perfect for me at 0% scaling.
[9193.82 --> 9196.00]  So I just have a ton of information on my screen.
[9196.22 --> 9197.22]  I love it.
[9198.28 --> 9198.76]  Yeah.
[9199.56 --> 9200.66]  Monitors as well.
[9201.62 --> 9202.66]  This one's from Chris.
[9202.78 --> 9206.98]  I just started a new career as an AV tech for a community school system.
[9206.98 --> 9209.74]  We've been busy installing new interactive TVs.
[9209.98 --> 9214.54]  What kind of tech that if you've seen would be helpful for teaching our youth?
[9214.96 --> 9215.86]  VR is super cool.
[9216.36 --> 9217.04]  I mean,
[9217.04 --> 9218.64]  it's super expensive and kludgy.
[9218.80 --> 9220.02]  So it's a long way from,
[9220.02 --> 9226.34]  I think being legitimately useful for like at scale for educational purposes.
[9226.34 --> 9227.66]  But man,
[9227.76 --> 9229.26]  3d printers would have been super cool.
[9229.34 --> 9231.62]  I would have loved to learn about modeling.
[9231.62 --> 9233.72]  A bunch of schools jumped on 3d printers right away,
[9233.72 --> 9236.82]  which I just thought was brilliant because I,
[9236.84 --> 9238.64]  I didn't think they would necessarily do it,
[9238.70 --> 9242.06]  but that is an absolutely wicked skill to have when you're growing up.
[9242.08 --> 9242.28]  Yeah.
[9242.36 --> 9246.72]  Like if your reaction to something breaking in a,
[9246.74 --> 9249.28]  in a physical way in your house is,
[9249.46 --> 9249.52]  Oh,
[9249.52 --> 9252.12]  I can fix that by like printing a new part or whatever.
[9252.34 --> 9253.62]  Epoxying it on or whatever.
[9253.68 --> 9254.78]  That is sick.
[9254.90 --> 9255.04]  Yeah.
[9255.04 --> 9255.64]  That's super cool.
[9255.64 --> 9256.64]  That is so cool.
[9259.02 --> 9259.42]  Okay.
[9259.44 --> 9260.20]  This one's from Charlie.
[9260.34 --> 9260.66]  Hi,
[9260.72 --> 9261.26]  Linus and Luke.
[9261.30 --> 9262.60]  It's probably been answered before,
[9262.60 --> 9264.74]  but what is the average age of your viewership?
[9264.94 --> 9266.02]  Love from New Zealand.
[9266.96 --> 9270.04]  This data is always going to be skewed.
[9270.78 --> 9271.78]  Like I I've,
[9271.84 --> 9274.16]  I've seen reports from our audience many,
[9274.30 --> 9275.26]  many times like,
[9275.88 --> 9276.26]  Hey,
[9276.36 --> 9280.22]  I couldn't help noticing that you guys say you're only like 1% female,
[9280.22 --> 9282.98]  but I'm definitely a chick or whatever.
[9283.24 --> 9287.74]  And Google thinks I'm a dude or something because I'm into dude stuff,
[9287.74 --> 9288.96]  but just letting you know,
[9289.12 --> 9289.32]  you know,
[9289.32 --> 9289.74]  like I,
[9289.76 --> 9290.74]  I hear that a ton.
[9290.80 --> 9291.74]  I don't know what that voice was.
[9291.78 --> 9292.44]  Don't worry about it.
[9292.60 --> 9293.52]  But like,
[9293.52 --> 9293.78]  I've,
[9293.78 --> 9298.22]  I've definitely gotten people reaching out to me who are like,
[9299.06 --> 9299.42]  you know,
[9299.64 --> 9300.80]  just as an FYI,
[9300.86 --> 9305.36]  you were talking about how you guys skew heavily male and I'm not going to
[9305.36 --> 9306.12]  dispute that.
[9306.30 --> 9309.74]  But what I will say is that we do exist.
[9309.94 --> 9311.06]  We do exist.
[9311.06 --> 9313.68]  And Google often misidentifies,
[9313.68 --> 9316.68]  misidentifies people,
[9316.68 --> 9317.84]  misidentifies people,
[9317.94 --> 9319.44]  especially ones who are not logged in,
[9319.52 --> 9321.32]  which is a significant number of users.
[9321.32 --> 9321.88]  Less today.
[9322.00 --> 9322.94]  Interests and stuff.
[9322.94 --> 9323.56]  Exactly.
[9323.56 --> 9334.70]  So they'll profile you and just kind of assume that because you looked at a razor once that you're a guy because it had a blue handle instead of a pink one or whatever arbitrary bullshit, right?
[9334.86 --> 9335.02]  Yeah.
[9335.02 --> 9336.50]  So there's that.
[9336.58 --> 9338.46]  And then we also get a lot of people telling us,
[9338.64 --> 9338.88]  Hey,
[9339.00 --> 9339.22]  yeah,
[9339.22 --> 9339.90]  I'm into it,
[9339.94 --> 9342.86]  but I always watch with the hubby,
[9343.38 --> 9343.68]  you know,
[9343.70 --> 9344.38]  stuff like that.
[9344.38 --> 9344.56]  Right.
[9344.64 --> 9346.36]  So it would be his account.
[9346.74 --> 9346.90]  Yeah.
[9346.90 --> 9347.48]  So I can,
[9347.54 --> 9348.42]  I can tell you,
[9348.64 --> 9349.28]  I can tell you,
[9349.34 --> 9349.42]  Oh,
[9349.46 --> 9349.68]  I know.
[9349.96 --> 9352.44]  I can tell you what Google reports to us.
[9352.74 --> 9359.40]  I'm just saying that I used that as the gender as an example of a way of,
[9359.90 --> 9360.50]  as a,
[9360.50 --> 9363.18]  as a way to illustrate that this data is.
[9363.36 --> 9364.34]  Cause like when I was a kid,
[9364.34 --> 9365.44]  if I was signing up for a website,
[9365.58 --> 9367.14]  I would go put in my birthday.
[9367.14 --> 9368.04]  And then when I hit the year,
[9368.08 --> 9370.58]  I would just whip the scroll wheel and click on something random.
[9370.92 --> 9372.54]  Like I still do that.
[9373.32 --> 9376.88]  If steam pops up an age restriction thing on my law,
[9376.90 --> 9380.04]  logged in account with a fucking credit card,
[9381.04 --> 9383.58]  what are you doing,
[9383.70 --> 9383.94]  bud?
[9384.76 --> 9385.08]  Right.
[9385.86 --> 9386.88]  I've had my,
[9387.14 --> 9389.20]  my account is old enough to vote.
[9390.18 --> 9390.66]  Right.
[9390.76 --> 9391.18]  So what,
[9391.38 --> 9391.62]  what,
[9391.62 --> 9392.88]  what is the point of this?
[9393.84 --> 9394.28]  Um,
[9394.56 --> 9394.74]  I,
[9394.84 --> 9396.38]  and I understand what the point is,
[9396.38 --> 9398.36]  but that doesn't mean I have to have patience for it.
[9398.60 --> 9399.02]  And so yeah,
[9399.12 --> 9399.42]  it fills.
[9399.70 --> 9400.26]  Oh,
[9400.32 --> 9400.56]  really?
[9400.78 --> 9401.30]  I don't know.
[9401.30 --> 9402.22]  Maybe it's a setting or something.
[9402.22 --> 9403.26]  Like I said it once.
[9403.32 --> 9404.80]  I know the screen you're talking about.
[9404.92 --> 9405.10]  Yeah.
[9405.10 --> 9405.58]  It's your birthday.
[9405.78 --> 9406.56]  I said it once.
[9406.56 --> 9407.04]  And now it,
[9407.04 --> 9410.38]  it takes that same thing I put in last time and has it by default.
[9410.54 --> 9411.30]  I haven't seen that.
[9411.50 --> 9411.68]  Weird.
[9411.78 --> 9412.06]  You know what?
[9412.10 --> 9412.78]  Maybe it's depending.
[9412.92 --> 9416.50]  I use new computers all the time because I'm always benchmarking.
[9416.52 --> 9418.10]  It's probably because I've done that on that.
[9418.10 --> 9419.26]  It's probably cached somewhere.
[9419.40 --> 9419.52]  Yeah.
[9419.60 --> 9419.82]  Yeah.
[9419.82 --> 9421.04]  So I run into it all the time.
[9421.06 --> 9421.26]  I'm like,
[9421.30 --> 9422.36]  stop wasting my time.
[9422.76 --> 9423.24]  Um,
[9423.24 --> 9423.90]  and so yeah,
[9423.90 --> 9424.28]  I just,
[9424.46 --> 9425.28]  whatever.
[9425.48 --> 9426.86]  And just select something random.
[9427.38 --> 9427.58]  Yeah.
[9427.62 --> 9428.24]  Get out of my way.
[9428.72 --> 9429.06]  Um,
[9429.12 --> 9429.40]  anyway,
[9429.70 --> 9431.18]  so the average,
[9431.32 --> 9431.44]  okay,
[9431.50 --> 9431.88]  so hold on.
[9431.94 --> 9432.02]  Oh,
[9432.12 --> 9432.24]  what?
[9432.32 --> 9432.44]  What?
[9432.60 --> 9433.90]  Median mode?
[9434.90 --> 9435.50]  Um,
[9435.50 --> 9437.58]  the bulk of our viewers,
[9437.82 --> 9442.20]  70% of them are 18 to 34,
[9442.72 --> 9446.22]  which is exactly what I would expect.
[9446.22 --> 9447.96]  That honestly sounds probably accurate.
[9448.10 --> 9448.28]  Yeah.
[9448.90 --> 9450.78]  Am I aging out of our audience?
[9452.22 --> 9452.78]  It's okay.
[9452.94 --> 9454.92]  There's these new filters now that make you look younger.
[9455.52 --> 9455.90]  Oh,
[9456.56 --> 9457.28]  it'll never matter.
[9457.38 --> 9457.46]  Oh,
[9457.50 --> 9458.06]  we got this.
[9458.42 --> 9460.14]  We talked about this quite a while ago.
[9460.36 --> 9460.72]  Botox filter.
[9460.90 --> 9461.16]  Was it,
[9461.22 --> 9462.20]  what are we talking about here?
[9462.40 --> 9465.34]  We talked about this quite a while ago about how you were worried about
[9465.34 --> 9466.50]  different features,
[9466.64 --> 9467.20]  uh,
[9467.44 --> 9471.84]  making you look older and then people not wanting to listen to tech person
[9471.84 --> 9472.56]  because they look.
[9472.56 --> 9472.74]  Yeah.
[9472.74 --> 9472.92]  Yeah.
[9472.92 --> 9473.46]  Tech boomer.
[9473.74 --> 9473.90]  Yeah.
[9474.00 --> 9477.66]  I do think there's a best before date on like tech personalities.
[9477.66 --> 9481.60]  100% filters that already exist that happen live.
[9482.00 --> 9482.50]  That's crazy.
[9482.52 --> 9484.98]  That make people genuinely look significantly longer,
[9485.18 --> 9485.40]  younger,
[9485.46 --> 9486.78]  and it looks actually like quite good.
[9486.84 --> 9487.36]  That's wild.
[9487.64 --> 9491.82]  It will totally be a thing and it will be like indistinguishable later on.
[9491.94 --> 9492.14]  I mean,
[9492.16 --> 9493.88]  if we keep putting wrinkles in the backdrop,
[9494.08 --> 9495.46]  then they'll distract from Linus.
[9495.70 --> 9495.90]  Yeah.
[9495.92 --> 9497.28]  Then they won't even be looking at me.
[9497.40 --> 9497.78]  Exactly.
[9498.04 --> 9498.22]  Yeah.
[9498.42 --> 9498.88]  Um,
[9499.74 --> 9500.02]  yeah.
[9500.02 --> 9500.50]  Uh,
[9500.64 --> 9502.26]  then the next big group,
[9502.58 --> 9504.92]  17% is 35 to 44.
[9504.92 --> 9507.44]  And then it trails off significantly from there.
[9507.44 --> 9509.52]  45 to 54 is 6.4.
[9509.60 --> 9510.16]  And then it's,
[9510.16 --> 9510.38]  uh,
[9510.38 --> 9511.16]  peanuts,
[9511.34 --> 9511.68]  um,
[9511.76 --> 9513.70]  below 18 and above 55.
[9514.96 --> 9515.44]  Um,
[9515.54 --> 9516.16]  but then again,
[9516.16 --> 9519.72]  I think there's a lot of younger people that are just clicking 18.
[9519.88 --> 9523.40]  I'm certain the below 18 number is smaller than it is in reality,
[9523.40 --> 9525.34]  but I bet you that what is it?
[9525.38 --> 9528.10]  18 to 35 one is actually probably pretty accurate.
[9528.62 --> 9528.86]  Yeah.
[9529.48 --> 9533.66]  I think the 25 to 34 one is probably the most accurate because that'll be the
[9533.66 --> 9537.22]  ones that are like have credit cards entered in the site and stuff like that.
[9538.14 --> 9538.52]  Um,
[9538.56 --> 9543.02]  where you can like really make a solid guess as to how,
[9543.12 --> 9544.12]  how old these people are.
[9544.44 --> 9544.58]  Yeah.
[9546.14 --> 9546.54]  Okay.
[9546.58 --> 9547.60]  This one's from Matthew.
[9547.74 --> 9547.94]  Hi,
[9548.02 --> 9548.62]  Linus and Luke.
[9548.74 --> 9552.48]  What are some red flags you look out for when interviewing staff?
[9552.48 --> 9552.84]  Red flags.
[9552.84 --> 9553.82]  On a side note,
[9553.98 --> 9554.74]  as a developer,
[9555.00 --> 9558.04]  seeing a float plane developers blog slash newsletter would be awesome.
[9558.04 --> 9560.16]  We just don't have the bandwidth for it.
[9561.78 --> 9562.42]  Yeah.
[9564.22 --> 9565.26]  Maybe eventually.
[9565.38 --> 9566.80]  I know Conrad has mentioned,
[9566.80 --> 9567.52]  uh,
[9567.52 --> 9569.58]  being interested in writing a,
[9569.58 --> 9571.64]  a newsletter for,
[9571.64 --> 9572.80]  uh,
[9572.82 --> 9574.02]  the LTT store before.
[9574.54 --> 9577.46]  So it's not like there will be no development stuff ever,
[9577.46 --> 9578.06]  but like,
[9578.66 --> 9578.82]  yeah,
[9578.82 --> 9579.00]  we,
[9579.00 --> 9580.70]  we definitely do not have the bandwidth.
[9581.06 --> 9581.22]  I mean,
[9581.28 --> 9584.42]  Luke had the idea of doing one like right at the start and he was like,
[9584.46 --> 9584.62]  yeah,
[9584.68 --> 9585.28]  even just,
[9585.66 --> 9586.54]  even if no one reads it,
[9586.54 --> 9589.24]  it would be so cool to look back over it,
[9590.24 --> 9590.50]  you know,
[9590.70 --> 9592.50]  five years down the line and it would be,
[9593.06 --> 9594.20]  but we've just been,
[9594.52 --> 9596.00]  I've documented some stuff anyways.
[9596.14 --> 9598.56]  I have like really old school screenshots and,
[9598.56 --> 9599.36]  and videos.
[9599.50 --> 9600.96]  Remember I had the idea of,
[9600.96 --> 9601.26]  um,
[9601.26 --> 9606.38]  of linking every comment and like every tweet where people told us we'd fail and
[9606.38 --> 9610.40]  like printing them out so that we could wallpaper like our office with it.
[9610.82 --> 9610.90]  Yeah.
[9611.02 --> 9611.32]  Um,
[9611.32 --> 9611.50]  we,
[9611.56 --> 9613.20]  we would actually have enough.
[9613.30 --> 9616.48]  Would we have enough devs like in person here to have like,
[9616.48 --> 9617.70]  a space where we could have put that?
[9617.76 --> 9618.06]  Probably.
[9618.28 --> 9619.66]  I think we could have done it at the lab.
[9619.82 --> 9620.46]  Once we're local,
[9620.52 --> 9621.70]  there will be at least three of us.
[9621.84 --> 9621.98]  Yeah.
[9623.26 --> 9624.64]  We need to do more float plane merch.
[9624.74 --> 9625.76]  That's a good point,
[9625.84 --> 9626.06]  Rod.
[9626.18 --> 9626.84]  Sorry about that.
[9626.90 --> 9627.02]  We'll,
[9627.06 --> 9627.20]  we'll,
[9627.20 --> 9627.76]  we'll do it.
[9627.78 --> 9628.20]  I promise.
[9628.90 --> 9629.30]  Um,
[9629.86 --> 9630.08]  I,
[9630.18 --> 9630.26]  Oh,
[9630.28 --> 9633.16]  I think our printer is finally back up and running and we're going to be doing
[9633.16 --> 9634.28]  some printed t-shirts again.
[9634.28 --> 9635.60]  So maybe we could do a blue,
[9635.74 --> 9636.96]  just like float plane logo one.
[9637.08 --> 9637.76]  Speaking of,
[9637.76 --> 9638.10]  uh,
[9638.10 --> 9639.48]  working here and stuff.
[9639.60 --> 9639.80]  Yeah.
[9639.86 --> 9640.42]  There's two,
[9640.52 --> 9642.40]  there's lots of roles on the site actually,
[9642.40 --> 9644.30]  especially if you want to work for labs.
[9644.30 --> 9645.08]  Oh my goodness.
[9645.48 --> 9645.76]  Uh,
[9645.76 --> 9646.92]  but there's two new ones,
[9646.92 --> 9647.68]  uh,
[9647.76 --> 9648.96]  that are kind of in my realm.
[9649.12 --> 9651.04]  One of them is a float plane project manager.
[9651.18 --> 9652.58]  It is a relatively small team.
[9652.66 --> 9654.06]  You will also have to do development.
[9654.34 --> 9654.78]  Um,
[9654.78 --> 9655.02]  but,
[9655.18 --> 9657.00]  but as a float plane project manager,
[9657.00 --> 9661.10]  so we're looking for someone to try to like work on tasking and help guide
[9661.10 --> 9661.50]  the ship.
[9662.02 --> 9662.46]  Um,
[9662.88 --> 9663.84]  so apply.
[9663.88 --> 9664.52]  So like what,
[9664.58 --> 9665.24]  like mini Luke?
[9666.94 --> 9667.52]  Kind of,
[9667.58 --> 9675.24]  but they will also do development and be much more in on things.
[9675.24 --> 9676.12]  If that makes sense.
[9676.12 --> 9676.38]  Okay.
[9677.00 --> 9677.36]  Uh,
[9677.36 --> 9680.86]  and then the other one is for Linus media group.
[9681.06 --> 9685.28]  So what I need to do is delete this stuff and just go to just jobs.
[9685.66 --> 9686.10]  Nice.
[9686.10 --> 9687.42]  And it's,
[9687.48 --> 9689.74]  that's totally elegant infrastructure administrator.
[9690.76 --> 9691.20]  Oh,
[9691.40 --> 9691.70]  yeah.
[9692.70 --> 9692.96]  Wow.
[9692.96 --> 9694.00]  We're finally doing it.
[9694.12 --> 9695.22]  We are finally doing it.
[9695.22 --> 9696.16]  It's about time.
[9697.90 --> 9702.20]  How much you want to bet that that particular posting gets a lot of
[9702.20 --> 9702.66]  applicants?
[9703.10 --> 9705.10]  I think it's going to get a bunch and I,
[9705.16 --> 9707.46]  I will throw out a warning here.
[9707.64 --> 9708.16]  Uh,
[9708.20 --> 9710.22]  this is a relatively senior position.
[9710.84 --> 9715.20]  And one of the reasons why it's a relatively senior position is because
[9715.20 --> 9719.72]  your decisions and actions are going to have to stand up to criticism
[9719.72 --> 9725.98]  against not only me and AJ and Linus and Jake.
[9726.10 --> 9726.22]  Yeah.
[9726.22 --> 9727.34]  Don't forget about Jake.
[9727.42 --> 9728.96]  Jake is Jake likes to criticize.
[9729.16 --> 9729.78]  And other Jake.
[9730.06 --> 9730.34]  Yeah.
[9730.34 --> 9731.00]  Oh yeah.
[9731.08 --> 9731.56]  Other Jake.
[9731.72 --> 9733.14]  And lots of other people.
[9733.20 --> 9734.98]  Don't forget about the 14 million out there.
[9735.06 --> 9736.24]  And the entire audience.
[9736.36 --> 9736.56]  Yeah.
[9736.64 --> 9737.46]  So no pressure though.
[9737.46 --> 9742.36]  And they love picking on infrastructure things that we do at the office.
[9742.36 --> 9745.26]  So you're going to be criticized for what you do now,
[9745.26 --> 9747.30]  even if you get it completely right.
[9747.30 --> 9749.54]  And it's actually the best solution for our needs.
[9749.54 --> 9752.18]  There will be people out there who are experts in their domain,
[9752.18 --> 9756.10]  but have no idea what it is exactly that we do here.
[9756.10 --> 9763.14]  And we'll suggest all kinds of the number of times over the years that I've been
[9763.14 --> 9765.74]  torn apart for not setting up a San.
[9765.74 --> 9779.56]  And I'm just like, no, no, that's just actually stupid and has nothing to do with what we do here.
[9780.68 --> 9781.08]  Chill.
[9782.40 --> 9783.30]  It's amazing.
[9783.48 --> 9786.18]  It's, it's actually, it's not that I don't know what it is.
[9786.36 --> 9788.02]  It's not that I couldn't afford one.
[9788.20 --> 9791.02]  It's that it would be stupid.
[9791.02 --> 9796.24]  And so, yeah, you'll, you'll, you'll be dealing with that.
[9796.44 --> 9798.06]  And it'll, it's, you're not a team of one.
[9798.14 --> 9799.52]  Oh, San, storage area network.
[9799.86 --> 9800.90]  You're not a team of one.
[9800.96 --> 9802.50]  You'll be working with Dan.
[9802.62 --> 9805.64]  Actually, you'll be working with another person that I can't name because they're Probo.
[9806.52 --> 9807.72]  You'll be working with me.
[9807.78 --> 9808.74]  You'll be working with AJ.
[9809.00 --> 9813.98]  You will have resources and stuff, but I want this person to come in to be fairly high level
[9813.98 --> 9817.20]  infrastructure, security, all that jazz.
[9818.32 --> 9820.02]  So yeah, apply.
[9820.02 --> 9822.18]  It's going to be pretty epic.
[9822.64 --> 9824.44]  The stuff that you do is going to show up on video.
[9824.52 --> 9828.76]  It should be actually a very fun job if you're into this type of stuff, but just, yeah, understand
[9828.76 --> 9831.04]  that it is a relatively senior position.
[9831.18 --> 9834.14]  We're not looking for someone like just out of school, something like that.
[9835.20 --> 9841.70]  Because not only will you be maintaining what is here, but you're going to have to, would
[9841.70 --> 9842.48]  they work with me?
[9843.48 --> 9844.22]  They work with Jaden.
[9846.06 --> 9847.00]  I kind of doubt it.
[9847.04 --> 9847.66]  I don't think so.
[9847.80 --> 9848.50]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[9848.50 --> 9849.34]  I mean, maybe.
[9850.02 --> 9851.28]  But yeah, I don't think so.
[9853.20 --> 9856.00]  Not only are you going to have to maintain what's already here, but you're going to have
[9856.00 --> 9857.26]  to keep it moving forward.
[9857.70 --> 9865.48]  And you're going to have to facilitate someone like Linus or Jake or whoever else going like,
[9865.52 --> 9867.22]  oh, I want to try this thing for a video.
[9867.22 --> 9871.06]  And then them coming in like a wrecking ball and doing whatever they want to do.
[9871.12 --> 9877.22]  And then you either need to pick it up where they left off and bring it to full implementation
[9877.22 --> 9882.24]  or deconstruct and keep going with what we had, yada, yada, yada.
[9882.24 --> 9886.02]  So it's going to be an interesting role.
[9886.22 --> 9886.76]  But yeah, apply.
[9888.30 --> 9888.74]  Cool.
[9889.22 --> 9893.08]  And what kind of red flags would you look out for when interviewing them?
[9893.08 --> 9896.94]  Well, there's a first time chat over here on Twitch, typical Twitch.
[9896.94 --> 9901.38]  One big red flag would be this question from Dim Shin.
[9901.78 --> 9903.24]  Is there a link to the job posting?
[9903.94 --> 9905.08]  That's the first test.
[9905.22 --> 9906.92]  If you can't find it, you're not hired.
[9908.54 --> 9909.86]  I mean, and you know what?
[9909.92 --> 9914.68]  Maybe that makes me like kind of a merciless asshole, but I just don't really care at a
[9914.68 --> 9915.08]  certain point.
[9915.08 --> 9916.16]  You got to have drive.
[9916.74 --> 9916.86]  Yeah.
[9916.88 --> 9921.50]  If you don't have problem solving skills, like if you don't want it, then yeah, that's a
[9921.50 --> 9922.02]  huge red flag.
[9922.02 --> 9923.78]  If you can't find that link, you'll never make it here.
[9923.84 --> 9929.42]  If you're like, if you don't want to micromanage, we don't have the people to micromanage.
[9929.46 --> 9929.54]  Yeah.
[9929.54 --> 9933.20]  If you tell me in an interview that you don't really want the job, I'm going to be like,
[9933.26 --> 9934.08]  then I don't really want you here.
[9934.22 --> 9936.02]  I have genuinely had that before.
[9936.12 --> 9936.28]  Yeah.
[9936.36 --> 9937.66]  Like why are you applying?
[9937.74 --> 9938.40]  I don't understand.
[9939.02 --> 9943.76]  Like if you're, why don't you go, well, go find something you want to do.
[9943.76 --> 9945.20]  I don't want to stand in the way of your happiness.
[9945.20 --> 9950.54]  Like you spent like it's 40 hours a week of your life, right?
[9950.54 --> 9952.98]  Like if you're not going to enjoy it, then get the out of here.
[9952.98 --> 9954.58]  Like why, why, what are you doing?
[9954.82 --> 9955.02]  Yeah.
[9955.26 --> 9955.88]  What are you doing?
[9955.96 --> 9956.84]  Take care of yourself.
[9956.84 --> 9957.14]  Right.
[9957.26 --> 9959.22]  I'm sure you're not going to like it every single day.
[9959.30 --> 9959.80]  I don't.
[9960.06 --> 9960.24]  Yeah.
[9960.40 --> 9961.12]  Nobody does.
[9961.32 --> 9961.94]  Who does?
[9962.02 --> 9963.28]  But you know, at least a little bit.
[9963.32 --> 9964.24]  Well, there has to be things.
[9964.40 --> 9966.00]  There has to be things that make up for it.
[9966.02 --> 9966.26]  Right.
[9968.36 --> 9970.60]  Joe, it's, it's, I made it hard required on this one.
[9970.60 --> 9977.62]  We, I know developers are not exactly necessarily known for their social skills and wanting to communicate a ton.
[9978.04 --> 9978.20]  Yeah.
[9978.20 --> 9988.04]  But we had a position fairly recently where the, the file drop for resume and cover letter was a required field, but you could just upload one thing.
[9988.04 --> 9996.24]  So like the vast majority of people just uploaded a resume with no cover letter, even though it says that you have to upload a resume and cover letter.
[9996.66 --> 9998.30]  And we were just like, fine.
[9998.52 --> 10000.24]  But now, haha, got them.
[10000.48 --> 10001.88]  Two separate fields, both required.
[10002.00 --> 10002.28]  Get owned.
[10004.18 --> 10005.76]  Submit the darn cover letter.
[10005.84 --> 10006.86]  We actually do read them.
[10007.10 --> 10007.26]  Come on.
[10007.32 --> 10009.48]  Face 32 says applicant gatekeeping.
[10009.70 --> 10010.00]  Weird.
[10010.54 --> 10011.46]  It's not weird.
[10011.58 --> 10013.86]  It's literally an entire job.
[10014.36 --> 10014.60]  Yeah.
[10014.60 --> 10017.96]  That's like, that's the whole point.
[10018.40 --> 10022.36]  That's like, oh man, that's such, that's such a terrible take.
[10023.34 --> 10032.60]  So, so what would your process be if someone doesn't care at all and doesn't want to, okay.
[10033.20 --> 10033.96]  Imagine it.
[10034.04 --> 10034.56]  It's like.
[10034.56 --> 10039.26]  I mean, it depends on how many applicants you have.
[10039.38 --> 10044.68]  If you have to fill a position and one person applies and they're like, well, you have to fill a position.
[10044.84 --> 10044.96]  Sure.
[10045.02 --> 10046.94]  I guess that sounds like an awful place to work.
[10047.32 --> 10047.52]  Yeah.
[10047.64 --> 10050.44]  I don't think I'd want to be on either side of that interview table.
[10051.44 --> 10056.58]  It's like, well, I might hate you, but I guess we're going to work together.
[10057.14 --> 10061.00]  Well, I might hate working for you, but I guess I'm stuck with it.
[10061.20 --> 10062.00]  Thanks for the money.
[10062.30 --> 10062.42]  Yeah.
[10062.42 --> 10063.04]  That's not great.
[10063.04 --> 10065.18]  That sounds like the worst thing ever.
[10065.34 --> 10074.50]  And like, I've had people that in interviews have told me that, I think we talked about this earlier in the show, even that they have like no idea who we are, what we do really.
[10074.50 --> 10078.60]  But they like really love this thing that they do.
[10078.68 --> 10080.68]  And they're excited to be able to do it in this environment.
[10080.68 --> 10082.70]  And I tell them different projects that we want to work on.
[10082.76 --> 10083.88]  They're like, yeah, that sounds sweet.
[10084.20 --> 10085.04]  Like, okay, great.
[10085.16 --> 10092.10]  Like, I don't care if you're excited about working here because of what, like the fandom of it.
[10092.10 --> 10094.88]  That has no benefit or I don't care either way.
[10094.88 --> 10098.76]  But if you're excited about doing the things that we do, then that's great.
[10098.88 --> 10098.96]  Yeah.
[10099.06 --> 10100.58]  Twitch is like still being Twitch.
[10100.72 --> 10102.06]  Robotic sausage over there.
[10102.14 --> 10107.58]  My probably terrible take is that asking for the link is problem solving through communication.
[10108.02 --> 10108.52]  No.
[10108.52 --> 10114.34]  Asking the CEO where the link to apply is, is not problem solving.
[10114.64 --> 10124.10]  Taking something that could take actually less time by typing a very similar thing to that, but not the same thing into Google and immediately getting results.
[10124.38 --> 10127.12]  Instead of doing that, taking two people's time.
[10127.36 --> 10132.06]  Throwing it out into the ether in like a fast moving live chat.
[10133.12 --> 10133.98]  Not better.
[10133.98 --> 10139.16]  That is problem solving, but that's a really bad solution.
[10139.86 --> 10140.84]  And you're the problem.
[10141.42 --> 10144.30]  It's like, I don't know what else to tell you.
[10146.34 --> 10147.72]  I love you, Twitch chat.
[10147.88 --> 10151.44]  I do think that this has got to be like Twitch chat.
[10151.68 --> 10153.52]  Just be in Twitch chat.
[10153.72 --> 10156.12]  Which is the only reason I'm going to give them attention for it.
[10156.26 --> 10159.48]  What is your opinion on people typoing their own email?
[10160.96 --> 10162.34]  And what is your opinion on it?
[10162.34 --> 10162.88]  It happens.
[10163.98 --> 10167.26]  If it's very obvious how it happened.
[10167.36 --> 10169.72]  Like it's dot OCM.
[10169.82 --> 10170.24]  It happens.
[10170.50 --> 10171.18]  It depends though.
[10171.38 --> 10173.52]  If they're applying for an accounting position, then they're out.
[10175.10 --> 10175.60]  Got it.
[10175.66 --> 10176.04]  That makes sense.
[10176.28 --> 10177.10]  Put a zero in the wrong spot.
[10177.18 --> 10178.44]  You better double check your shit.
[10179.30 --> 10184.16]  Whereas if they're applying for a creative position where really what I need is dragon energy.
[10184.16 --> 10190.54]  And if they've got a little bit of the dyslexia or they fat finger a key on their keyboard once in a while, that's not a game breaker.
[10190.90 --> 10192.18]  Everything is context dependent.
[10192.28 --> 10192.46]  Right?
[10192.62 --> 10196.26]  So, yeah.
[10196.26 --> 10204.30]  I mean, if you were just going to create a flow chart of how to weed out applicants, then you might as well just be an AI.
[10204.62 --> 10204.76]  Right?
[10204.80 --> 10208.16]  You've got to be actually thinking.
[10208.28 --> 10210.92]  Otherwise, why don't I just replace you with a robot?
[10211.42 --> 10211.52]  Right?
[10211.52 --> 10220.26]  One interesting one that I've ran into, and I will warn people of this again because I suspect we're going to get a lot of applicants for this.
[10220.74 --> 10221.86]  It's super neat.
[10221.86 --> 10230.46]  And honestly, even if you're applying for the infrastructure position, especially if you're running your own mail server or whatever, like that's pretty cool.
[10230.80 --> 10232.14]  Make sure it works.
[10234.08 --> 10234.56]  Yeah.
[10234.72 --> 10236.02]  Had that problem a lot.
[10236.54 --> 10241.62]  Oh, just people like submitting cool like projects they've worked on and you look at it and you're like, this is very broken.
[10241.68 --> 10242.50]  People will submit.
[10242.80 --> 10242.96]  Yeah.
[10243.18 --> 10245.00]  Here's my portfolio website.
[10245.40 --> 10247.74]  It's been under construction for six years.
[10248.06 --> 10250.68]  There's nothing literally interesting on it at all.
[10250.68 --> 10251.60]  And it barely loads.
[10251.60 --> 10254.70]  It's like, you probably would have been better off just not showing me that.
[10255.00 --> 10255.24]  Right.
[10255.78 --> 10259.02]  Or mail servers, which have like major issues.
[10259.02 --> 10262.08]  So I literally can't even email them back from Gmail.
[10263.46 --> 10264.82]  That's also a problem.
[10265.48 --> 10268.78]  Like there's, be a little careful with things.
[10268.92 --> 10269.76]  Check your stuff.
[10270.08 --> 10270.80]  Check your stuff.
[10271.68 --> 10278.56]  I had somebody who, they linked a portfolio website that I think they like didn't pay their hosting or something.
[10278.88 --> 10283.34]  So I went to go check it and it was like very clearly offline.
[10283.80 --> 10288.54]  So I messaged them about it and they're like, oh yeah, like I haven't actually checked that in quite a while.
[10288.62 --> 10290.86]  It's like, maybe do that before you apply, bro.
[10291.38 --> 10291.68]  Right.
[10291.78 --> 10291.98]  Okay.
[10292.10 --> 10293.00]  Those types of things.
[10293.08 --> 10295.00]  So you're basically looking for basic due diligence.
[10295.00 --> 10296.00]  Yeah.
[10296.00 --> 10298.84]  Because a lot of the roles that I'm hiring for, that's actually really important.
[10299.36 --> 10299.50]  Right.
[10301.90 --> 10302.26]  Yeah.
[10302.42 --> 10303.70]  And there's, I don't know.
[10303.90 --> 10305.04]  It's one of those tough things, right?
[10305.06 --> 10308.84]  Like there's personality traits that you can't really expect to train.
[10309.10 --> 10312.86]  Like you can train a skill, but you can't train an attitude in a lot of cases.
[10312.86 --> 10318.80]  And so if someone just has an attitude of perfectionism, then that's a very, that's a very desirable trait.
[10318.90 --> 10320.64]  Again, for, you know, something like an accounting position.
[10320.82 --> 10321.06]  Depends.
[10321.16 --> 10321.28]  Yeah.
[10321.56 --> 10321.74]  Yeah.
[10321.98 --> 10327.58]  You might not actually want that all the time because perfectionism will often also mean that they take more time to do things.
[10327.68 --> 10327.80]  Yeah.
[10328.26 --> 10329.76]  So like, it depends.
[10329.76 --> 10330.36]  Yeah.
[10330.36 --> 10330.44]  Yeah.
[10330.66 --> 10337.28]  And I think, yeah, I think that's, I think we've talked about a lot of red flags.
[10337.38 --> 10345.34]  We've given a lot of hints to the WAN show audience for how to, how to, how to avoid our, our traps here.
[10346.68 --> 10347.08]  Okay.
[10347.12 --> 10351.22]  So I won't email the CEO asking for the application form.
[10351.34 --> 10351.70]  Got it.
[10351.80 --> 10352.20]  Yes.
[10352.76 --> 10353.20]  Success.
[10355.86 --> 10356.40]  All right.
[10356.42 --> 10357.56]  Next up's from Alex.
[10357.56 --> 10364.14]  Hey, Linus and Luke, what's something tech related that you vastly disagree on and have just agreed to disagree?
[10365.56 --> 10366.46]  Razor laptops.
[10367.68 --> 10369.44]  I don't think I disagree.
[10370.14 --> 10370.46]  Now.
[10372.06 --> 10373.82]  Well, we did for a long time.
[10374.10 --> 10379.54]  We had a strong disagreeance about those for a long time, all the way back to pre Linus Media Group, actually.
[10380.10 --> 10380.28]  Really?
[10380.56 --> 10380.76]  Yeah.
[10381.16 --> 10384.26]  I mean, I don't, I thought, I thought their switchblade thing was stupid.
[10384.26 --> 10389.24]  I thought it was cool, but like cool and like, I'd like to see where this goes in the future kind of way.
[10389.30 --> 10391.06]  Not like a, this is a good laptop kind of way.
[10391.60 --> 10394.66]  Eventually you want, I think we were still not Linus Media Group yet.
[10394.74 --> 10397.20]  Maybe we were just still working NCX once a week.
[10397.32 --> 10397.80]  I don't know.
[10397.88 --> 10398.22]  You know what?
[10398.26 --> 10403.44]  I didn't have, I had never really like owned a Razor anything and I didn't have firsthand experience with their QA.
[10404.08 --> 10404.28]  Yeah.
[10404.46 --> 10405.54]  I did at that point.
[10405.80 --> 10406.06]  Sure.
[10406.06 --> 10406.94]  So that's fair.
[10407.04 --> 10407.16]  Yeah.
[10407.16 --> 10407.88]  We disagreed.
[10409.50 --> 10414.86]  But that's, I don't know if that's really like a technology, is it like technology disagreement?
[10414.98 --> 10416.12]  It just says tech related.
[10416.32 --> 10416.90]  Tech related.
[10416.96 --> 10417.72]  What's something tech related?
[10417.72 --> 10427.74]  I mean, I've made fun of you for like standing Firefox for the longest time, especially when it was going through its very long period of being a complete and absolute piece of shit.
[10428.18 --> 10428.44]  Yeah.
[10428.44 --> 10435.80]  Um, I actually think Firefox is in a good state right now, but the problem with it is site compatibility.
[10436.46 --> 10441.06]  Like when I, I told you that I tried to switch to it, I think we've talked about this on the show, so I'll try to keep it short.
[10441.30 --> 10444.14]  But I did try to switch to it and it was actually very good.
[10444.26 --> 10445.46]  I really enjoyed using it.
[10445.52 --> 10448.22]  And then I had to use the PADI website.
[10448.54 --> 10448.90]  Yeah.
[10448.94 --> 10449.86]  The scuba diving website.
[10450.06 --> 10450.26]  Yeah.
[10450.32 --> 10451.60]  That's a terrible website.
[10452.26 --> 10452.88]  I don't doubt it.
[10453.14 --> 10455.08]  It doesn't work on Firefox at all.
[10455.08 --> 10458.54]  So it's just like, okay, I guess I have to go back to Chrome.
[10458.82 --> 10462.02]  Other than that, I actually really enjoyed the Firefox experience.
[10462.08 --> 10462.76]  I thought it was really good.
[10466.14 --> 10466.90]  I have to pee.
[10466.98 --> 10467.88]  It hit me like a ton of bricks.
[10467.94 --> 10468.38]  I'll be right back.
[10468.80 --> 10469.16]  Okay.
[10469.54 --> 10470.98]  I drank this whole thing.
[10471.20 --> 10473.26]  I don't think most tech stuff we disagree on though.
[10474.38 --> 10476.82]  Let me see if I can find some Luke specific one.
[10477.28 --> 10477.50]  Yeah.
[10477.90 --> 10478.16]  Yeah.
[10478.16 --> 10478.86]  Fact oriented.
[10479.02 --> 10479.12]  Yeah.
[10479.76 --> 10479.96]  Yeah.
[10479.96 --> 10480.86]  I don't know if that came through.
[10480.94 --> 10484.90]  He was saying we're both pretty fact oriented, which is true.
[10484.90 --> 10493.52]  Like we both had Athlon 64 AMD processors in our systems forever ago and then ran Intel for a long time when Intel was winning.
[10494.10 --> 10497.78]  And it wasn't because we liked AMD and then liked Intel.
[10497.90 --> 10499.94]  It was because AMD stuff was awesome.
[10499.94 --> 10501.34]  And then Intel stuff was awesome.
[10501.84 --> 10504.84]  And now we're both back on AMD stuff because now AMD stuff's awesome.
[10504.98 --> 10507.34]  Like it's more about just like what's good at the time, you know?
[10508.08 --> 10510.02]  I've got a specific one here for you, Luke.
[10510.10 --> 10510.36]  Sure.
[10510.50 --> 10511.24]  This is from Matthew.
[10511.24 --> 10515.04]  Hey, Luke, what do you think about the recent layoffs at the big tech companies?
[10515.50 --> 10518.24]  Do you think they will continue or will they start to rehire?
[10518.44 --> 10519.48]  And what about Flowplane?
[10520.92 --> 10522.24]  Well, Flowplane's hiring right now.
[10523.72 --> 10526.18]  I announced a position, I think, 10 minutes ago.
[10526.50 --> 10527.18]  So that's a thing.
[10527.60 --> 10535.58]  Flowplane will also probably, but it's going to somewhat depend on how things go in a variety of ways.
[10535.58 --> 10540.02]  But we will probably be hiring again before the year is over.
[10540.16 --> 10541.36]  But I don't know when.
[10541.60 --> 10545.64]  It's very likely that's going to be like Q3 or even maybe Q4.
[10545.86 --> 10549.04]  Like it might be near the end of the year, but it's very likely we'll be hiring again.
[10550.98 --> 10556.00]  And we're finishing up a hiring wave for the lab's web development team right now.
[10556.00 --> 10561.04]  I know the lab's local team is hiring, I believe, a junior software developer.
[10562.66 --> 10564.78]  Like, yeah, we're hiring.
[10565.30 --> 10569.24]  And we didn't have like giant layoffs.
[10569.80 --> 10571.74]  So we are not in that category.
[10573.76 --> 10574.80]  Will it continue?
[10574.98 --> 10576.58]  I don't know.
[10576.68 --> 10578.86]  I'm not really in the like Silicon Valley world.
[10579.00 --> 10579.94]  So I have no idea.
[10579.94 --> 10583.58]  I suspect companies that haven't done it yet, I would be concerned.
[10584.80 --> 10591.14]  But if your company has done one of those massive layoffs, I think they're probably done now unless they're Twitter.
[10591.32 --> 10591.46]  Lol.
[10596.40 --> 10599.60]  And yeah, I've already seen some of those companies start hiring again.
[10599.60 --> 10615.04]  I think a lot of them, once a couple other companies started doing it, tried to use like, oh, it's just the industry as a scapegoat to get rid of sections of the company to like slim down in cost effective ways.
[10615.04 --> 10619.56]  Not because they had to, but just purely because of like they thought the stock would go up.
[10620.58 --> 10620.68]  All right.
[10620.80 --> 10621.50]  So smell my hand.
[10623.70 --> 10624.22]  Fresh.
[10624.34 --> 10625.52]  Can you identify that smell?
[10625.52 --> 10630.00]  We have new soap and I was, I was kind of identify like bemused.
[10630.18 --> 10630.86]  What like theme?
[10631.20 --> 10631.40]  Yeah.
[10631.40 --> 10632.76]  Like what, what, what's that smell?
[10634.38 --> 10634.90]  Lavender?
[10635.30 --> 10636.30]  Watermelon and mint.
[10637.10 --> 10637.58]  Yeah.
[10637.94 --> 10639.16]  Watermelon and mint soap.
[10639.26 --> 10640.90]  What, what is watermelon and mint?
[10641.06 --> 10641.16]  What?
[10641.34 --> 10643.06]  It doesn't smell like watermelon and mint.
[10643.14 --> 10645.30]  Very, very unlikely combination.
[10647.02 --> 10648.98]  Maybe like watermelon flavored gum.
[10649.14 --> 10649.36]  Yeah.
[10649.38 --> 10651.08]  I was going to say like chemical watermelon.
[10651.32 --> 10651.78]  Like that ester.
[10652.00 --> 10652.22]  Yeah.
[10652.22 --> 10652.60]  Yeah.
[10652.60 --> 10653.70]  Maybe chemical watermelon.
[10654.06 --> 10654.22]  Yeah.
[10654.34 --> 10654.62]  Anyway.
[10654.62 --> 10657.24]  Totally normal.
[10658.50 --> 10659.36]  Real podcast.
[10659.40 --> 10659.96]  We have fun here.
[10660.88 --> 10663.10]  This one's from Jacob.
[10663.84 --> 10668.92]  Does the LTD backpack have enough space to soar a full face motorcycle helmet?
[10669.26 --> 10672.74]  I ride a 01 Honda Shadow 69K miles, baby.
[10673.24 --> 10677.74]  And most backpacks are uncomfortable and small or too expensive with bad quality.
[10677.92 --> 10678.64]  It's a good question.
[10678.74 --> 10682.56]  You might be able to pack it in there, but I wouldn't say the back would be particularly comfortable.
[10682.56 --> 10683.08]  Yeah.
[10683.08 --> 10684.06]  I don't know that I would.
[10684.38 --> 10684.70]  Yeah.
[10684.70 --> 10685.88]  I don't know that I would recommend it.
[10686.02 --> 10686.84]  Check the dimensions.
[10687.18 --> 10687.76]  They're on the site.
[10687.76 --> 10690.28]  This is an anonymous one.
[10690.28 --> 10691.90]  Hi, Linus, Luke, and Dan.
[10692.22 --> 10696.04]  YouTube has been recommending the old videos of yours with Brian the electrician.
[10696.24 --> 10696.94]  Great theme song.
[10697.14 --> 10697.62]  Where's he been?
[10698.34 --> 10699.22]  Brian moved.
[10699.68 --> 10700.00]  Oh.
[10700.16 --> 10700.32]  Yeah.
[10700.32 --> 10701.10]  He's not local anymore.
[10701.28 --> 10701.90]  I was kind of wondering.
[10701.90 --> 10702.06]  Yeah.
[10702.06 --> 10702.84]  I messaged him recently.
[10702.92 --> 10703.78]  I just sent him a screwdriver.
[10704.14 --> 10705.20]  Just like, hey, how's it going?
[10705.26 --> 10705.74]  Do you have a screwdriver?
[10705.74 --> 10706.76]  He's like, no, I'm going to buy one.
[10706.78 --> 10707.32]  I'm like, no, you're not.
[10708.44 --> 10710.32]  So he has a screwdriver now, says he likes it.
[10711.12 --> 10712.28]  But that's about it.
[10712.92 --> 10713.16]  Yeah.
[10713.86 --> 10714.08]  Oh.
[10714.64 --> 10714.94]  Yeah.
[10715.18 --> 10715.92]  This one's from Garen.
[10716.46 --> 10716.94]  Hey, guys.
[10716.98 --> 10718.56]  I've been a fan for about eight years now.
[10718.56 --> 10723.48]  Did a project for school, graphic design, recently involving advertising for companies.
[10723.96 --> 10727.56]  Do y'all have a brand standard manual or something similar?
[10727.74 --> 10729.38]  If we do, I've never seen it.
[10729.56 --> 10731.56]  But I wouldn't be surprised if...
[10732.70 --> 10733.40]  So like a pitch deck?
[10734.40 --> 10734.80]  No.
[10734.92 --> 10735.48]  I have no idea.
[10735.54 --> 10742.62]  No, it's like a whole guideline thing for how many pixels far away you need to be from
[10742.62 --> 10743.62]  the border of something.
[10744.06 --> 10746.80]  And if it's on a dark background, what does it look like?
[10746.80 --> 10748.28]  And if it's on a light background, what does it look like?
[10748.28 --> 10751.20]  I'm pretty sure Sarah has something like that, but I don't think I've ever seen it.
[10751.80 --> 10755.18]  Canadian rail branding is like the best one ever.
[10755.92 --> 10758.00]  It's really detailed about all sorts of...
[10758.00 --> 10758.52]  CN rail.
[10758.52 --> 10758.84]  Yeah.
[10759.68 --> 10760.88]  This one's from Tugs.
[10760.88 --> 10761.40]  Question.
[10761.60 --> 10766.40]  As a small business owner with success, what do you feel your biggest we are effed moment
[10766.40 --> 10768.20]  was and how did you overcome it?
[10769.02 --> 10770.90]  Oh, that's a pretty easy one.
[10771.30 --> 10779.22]  In the very early days when we had no money, YOLO went outside and filmed a video in the
[10779.22 --> 10779.54]  rain.
[10780.26 --> 10785.10]  And I kind of figured, well, there aren't that many gaps in the chassis of the Sony FS700
[10785.10 --> 10785.34]  camera.
[10785.34 --> 10786.24]  Oh, I thought it was a different story.
[10786.24 --> 10790.48]  Oh, did you think it was going to be the windy day?
[10791.12 --> 10792.90]  No, the drive to the ferry.
[10793.94 --> 10796.10]  Oh, well, that was just...
[10796.10 --> 10798.42]  We could have died, but other than that, it would have been fine.
[10798.82 --> 10800.06]  No, let's not talk about that.
[10800.80 --> 10806.54]  Let's talk about instead going out and filming in the rain because they didn't really seem
[10806.54 --> 10808.10]  like there were that many gaps in the chassis.
[10808.10 --> 10811.50]  We finished the shoot, got back to the house.
[10811.76 --> 10814.70]  I went to turn on the camera and black screen.
[10815.42 --> 10819.90]  So I disassembled it to the greatest degree that I could that night after everyone else
[10819.90 --> 10821.72]  had gone home or to their room upstairs.
[10822.30 --> 10823.84]  It was very early days.
[10824.48 --> 10828.80]  And I didn't have a space heater other than a radiant style one.
[10828.80 --> 10834.16]  And I didn't really want to point a radiant style heater at my black camera, not knowing
[10834.16 --> 10837.26]  what was sensitive or not sensitive to heat.
[10837.90 --> 10845.52]  So the only blower style air cooler I could conceive of was a test bench with a GeForce
[10845.52 --> 10848.74]  4080 on it or 480.
[10849.00 --> 10850.26]  Yeah, with a 480 on it.
[10850.26 --> 10854.88]  And so I think I put a couple of them on there, fired up Furmark or like some other stress
[10854.88 --> 10860.94]  test in SLI and basically just put the camera in the exhaust so that whatever was in there
[10860.94 --> 10862.42]  might hopefully evaporate.
[10862.58 --> 10868.26]  If I remember correctly, at this point in time, I had a 480 in my system and we ripped it out
[10868.26 --> 10872.84]  of my system to help this heating project, which was just very funny.
[10873.04 --> 10873.28]  Yeah.
[10873.28 --> 10882.10]  So that was terrifying because at that point, if we had not had a camera, I didn't really
[10882.10 --> 10885.76]  have a way to get another like camera easily.
[10886.08 --> 10887.86]  We were, it was, it was tight.
[10888.20 --> 10888.82]  Yeah, it was tight.
[10888.94 --> 10891.20]  Even the method of getting that one was fun and exciting.
[10891.36 --> 10891.68]  Yeah.
[10891.80 --> 10892.02]  Yeah.
[10892.08 --> 10893.42]  Like, yeah.
[10893.52 --> 10896.36]  Didn't we like import it from the States or something like that?
[10896.56 --> 10897.26]  And then like.
[10897.70 --> 10899.04]  In a specific way.
[10899.04 --> 10899.36]  Yeah.
[10899.60 --> 10906.10]  We shipped it to NCIX who, I forget why, but it was like hard to get it in Canada for
[10906.10 --> 10906.54]  some reason.
[10906.64 --> 10907.14]  It was stupid.
[10909.52 --> 10909.92]  Yeah.
[10912.42 --> 10912.82]  Okay.
[10912.86 --> 10914.86]  Let's get you another one here.
[10914.96 --> 10916.48]  No, we're not talking about the fairy thing.
[10916.98 --> 10917.78]  This one's from.
[10920.40 --> 10920.80]  Yeah.
[10920.90 --> 10921.80]  No, no.
[10923.08 --> 10924.04]  It's not happening.
[10924.40 --> 10925.08]  This one's from Connor.
[10925.16 --> 10926.20]  Tell us about the fairy thing.
[10926.28 --> 10926.42]  No.
[10926.50 --> 10926.66]  Okay.
[10927.08 --> 10927.70]  Hi guys.
[10927.70 --> 10928.92]  I like the screwdriver.
[10929.04 --> 10930.22]  Now getting in the water bottle.
[10930.54 --> 10935.08]  My question is, what is the most notable thing in everyone's opinion to spring out of the
[10935.08 --> 10936.70]  LMG media universe?
[10937.12 --> 10938.14]  Mine is the Lambo.
[10938.14 --> 10942.40]  Oh, it's got to be the like sad Linus or Linus selfie like memes.
[10943.14 --> 10945.30]  I did not see that coming.
[10945.44 --> 10949.36]  What about the, wait, I don't know if this is fair.
[10949.54 --> 10953.36]  I was going to say your original screwdriver was orange and that literally set the color
[10953.36 --> 10954.60]  for the company forever.
[10954.92 --> 10955.90]  That's pretty notable.
[10956.40 --> 10956.74]  Yeah.
[10956.74 --> 10959.10]  I don't know that it sprung out of us though.
[10960.24 --> 10962.66]  Like, yeah, that's why I kind of, yeah.
[10963.00 --> 10966.34]  The LTT cinematic universe, I think.
[10966.34 --> 10971.52]  Um, yeah, I think it would be, uh, there's the Christmas album.
[10972.32 --> 10972.72]  Sorry.
[10972.72 --> 10973.66]  I couldn't even finish that.
[10974.98 --> 10976.58]  It's a real thing, by the way.
[10976.58 --> 10981.64]  You can DM the CEO and ask where to buy it.
[10981.88 --> 10982.56]  Oh God.
[10982.64 --> 10983.92]  Uh, or you could just Google it.
[10983.96 --> 10984.72]  That might be faster.
[10984.94 --> 10985.22]  Yeah.
[10985.62 --> 10987.36]  It's awful.
[10988.10 --> 10994.52]  I still, and I, I could filter them out, but I don't want to because I, every single time
[10994.52 --> 10996.30]  it happens, I just laugh so hard.
[10996.30 --> 10999.30]  I still get emailed every single time one of them sells.
[11000.80 --> 11005.34]  And I just, every time I get like a ping on my phone, I'm like, oh, what's going on?
[11005.34 --> 11007.38]  And I see what email it went to.
[11007.48 --> 11008.28]  And I'm like, oh, interesting.
[11008.40 --> 11009.68]  Like, I wonder what this is.
[11009.68 --> 11010.38]  And I drag it down.
[11010.42 --> 11014.16]  It's like, you have sold one, one copy of the LNG Christmas album.
[11014.16 --> 11017.10]  And just every time it chews me up, it's great.
[11020.00 --> 11023.86]  Because you know that someone just purchased raw trash.
[11024.06 --> 11025.64]  Like, it's so bad.
[11026.16 --> 11027.36]  It's digital garbage.
[11028.12 --> 11030.82]  It's an actual waste of zeros and ones.
[11031.34 --> 11032.82]  It's so bad.
[11033.06 --> 11034.16]  It is so, so terrible.
[11034.18 --> 11037.04]  Pugboy1321 says, oh God, I forgot about that album.
[11037.26 --> 11040.32]  It means whatever the opposite of a Grammy is.
[11040.32 --> 11045.12]  I had it on my phone for a while because, I don't even remember why.
[11045.24 --> 11048.80]  It literally wasn't to listen to, but it was on a local file on my phone.
[11049.30 --> 11054.00]  So Google Play Music back in the day would just randomly start playing it.
[11054.76 --> 11059.00]  If I had it on like, play random songs, because it would be like, it's in your local files.
[11059.08 --> 11060.20]  You must like this music.
[11060.48 --> 11063.54]  So I'd be like driving along and I'd be listening to whatever.
[11063.68 --> 11067.38]  And then out of nowhere, I just hear Linus singing Silent Night.
[11067.38 --> 11072.22]  Make the album a Floatplane exclusive.
[11072.58 --> 11074.10]  He told me to upload it for Christmas.
[11074.92 --> 11077.22]  And then I don't remember why I didn't, but there was some reason.
[11077.36 --> 11078.68]  But I'm planning on doing it next Christmas.
[11078.68 --> 11085.78]  Look, if you guys are watching us like laughing about this and thinking, oh man, this must be like hilarious.
[11086.06 --> 11086.76]  It's worth buying.
[11086.92 --> 11087.08]  No.
[11088.66 --> 11090.84]  Just understand that it's bad and don't do it.
[11091.06 --> 11092.44]  Yeah, it's not worth it.
[11092.54 --> 11096.16]  It's like $5 and it's not worth it.
[11096.16 --> 11101.52]  It's like, it's a level of cringe, which is not actually very entertaining.
[11103.50 --> 11103.94]  Yeah.
[11104.16 --> 11105.04]  Yeah, it's really not.
[11105.04 --> 11110.06]  I mean, look, I'll take your money, but don't give it to me.
[11110.56 --> 11111.44]  It's $3.
[11111.86 --> 11112.98]  Buy something on the store.
[11113.08 --> 11116.12]  It's $3 and it is not worth it.
[11116.12 --> 11123.32]  It's even missing songs.
[11123.82 --> 11125.60]  And there's nothing we can do about it.
[11125.66 --> 11127.04]  It's missing songs.
[11127.18 --> 11127.36]  Yeah.
[11127.52 --> 11130.08]  Like songs that were in the teaser that we advertised?
[11130.08 --> 11131.44]  We like lost tracks.
[11131.84 --> 11132.42]  How did we do that?
[11132.46 --> 11133.80]  I remember trying to hunt it down.
[11133.90 --> 11138.24]  I don't remember all the details, but apparently, yeah, there's just songs that are just gone.
[11138.24 --> 11142.50]  So people, you don't even get the full album.
[11144.00 --> 11149.40]  Because I figured, once we figured out that it was missing songs, because it's just like a zip, if I remember correctly.
[11149.92 --> 11150.12]  Yeah.
[11150.12 --> 11151.72]  You don't like get it in a reasonable way.
[11151.86 --> 11153.82]  You just download it and get a zip file.
[11153.82 --> 11162.64]  So when I, someone told me it was missing songs, I asked about it internally and they were like, oh yeah, we just don't have those.
[11162.88 --> 11166.04]  So then I had to update it being like, uh, yeah, these don't exist, whatever.
[11167.64 --> 11170.76]  100, 1100, oh yeah, my phone's going.
[11171.22 --> 11172.42]  Oh no, why?
[11172.42 --> 11173.44]  You guys are stupid.
[11173.84 --> 11174.40]  Stop.
[11174.92 --> 11176.28]  I want to remaster it.
[11177.60 --> 11178.98]  It's not worth it.
[11179.02 --> 11180.46]  Can I please spend time on this?
[11180.46 --> 11181.86]  Absolutely not.
[11181.86 --> 11183.42]  You have much more important things to do.
[11183.42 --> 11184.14]  Forbidden.
[11184.78 --> 11185.02]  Damn.
[11185.32 --> 11185.72]  Forbidden.
[11186.10 --> 11187.38]  Five people have bought it.
[11187.48 --> 11187.74]  Please.
[11188.00 --> 11198.18]  Oh, the other fun part is the email comes in and how our Envision Powerboard, the software that we use for the forum, how it works is you could get commissions off of things that you sell.
[11199.06 --> 11200.84]  It has to be uploaded by an account.
[11201.08 --> 11204.76]  So it's uploaded by my account, but the commission is just set to 0%.
[11204.76 --> 11205.16]  Sure.
[11205.60 --> 11208.18]  So every single time it emails me, it's all excited.
[11208.18 --> 11210.86]  It says, you have earned 0.00 dollars.
[11213.42 --> 11216.58]  Seven people bought it.
[11217.14 --> 11218.44]  Genuinely, it is not worth it.
[11218.60 --> 11221.02]  You're going to download it because you're like, this is a fantastic meme.
[11221.18 --> 11223.56]  You're going to play one song and just be like, ugh.
[11223.92 --> 11226.44]  You're not going to make it through a full song, I promise.
[11226.44 --> 11226.86]  No, it's bad.
[11227.04 --> 11227.88]  It's really bad.
[11227.88 --> 11229.72]  I wonder if I can find the lyrics.
[11230.10 --> 11232.22]  I think I did it in a Google Doc.
[11233.14 --> 11234.46]  Only five, are you nuts?
[11234.56 --> 11239.62]  That's the amount of emails that I have right now, but they might stroll in slowly over time.
[11239.74 --> 11240.68]  Oh, no, that's the wrong.
[11240.76 --> 11241.62]  This is the wrong account.
[11242.02 --> 11243.32]  Or rather, this is the right account.
[11243.60 --> 11244.60]  I have 12 emails now.
[11244.60 --> 11247.12]  This is the account I'm supposed to be sent into.
[11247.12 --> 11247.26]  Oh, boy.
[11247.34 --> 11248.56]  Every time I refresh, it goes up.
[11248.66 --> 11249.74]  We should have increased the price.
[11250.66 --> 11250.96]  Yeah.
[11251.28 --> 11251.88]  No, we shouldn't.
[11253.00 --> 11254.38]  We will not increase the price.
[11254.38 --> 11256.02]  Okay, so hold on.
[11256.30 --> 11262.38]  Christmas might not work here because it's going to bring up Christmas parties and stuff like that.
[11263.38 --> 11266.18]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[11266.26 --> 11267.34]  I wonder, man, how?
[11269.24 --> 11272.98]  Maybe if I try lyrics or something like that.
[11273.88 --> 11274.92]  What year was it?
[11274.94 --> 11275.44]  What are you trying to do?
[11276.96 --> 11281.38]  That would have been 2015, I think.
[11281.38 --> 11283.16]  Man, these are in no particular order.
[11283.16 --> 11285.52]  There was the announcements on YouTube.
[11286.20 --> 11287.26]  Lyrics.doc.
[11287.50 --> 11288.02]  What's this?
[11290.26 --> 11290.70]  Who dis?
[11291.34 --> 11294.40]  Linus Tech Tips Christmas Album.
[11296.48 --> 11303.02]  Yeah, the Linus Media Group Christmas Album promotional video from seven years ago is still up.
[11303.84 --> 11305.14]  That's 301,000 views.
[11305.28 --> 11306.32]  Copy of Linus Tech Tips Christmas.
[11306.44 --> 11306.96]  Here we go.
[11307.24 --> 11307.76]  Here we go.
[11308.20 --> 11310.46]  Original Christmas song track list.
[11311.24 --> 11312.86]  Jingle Bell's not done yet.
[11314.02 --> 11322.12]  Deck the Hall, Silent Night, The First Noel, Twelve Days of Christmas, Joy to the World, O Come All Ye Faithful, Christmas Tree, Hark the Herald Angels Sing, We Wish You Merry Christmas, and God Rest Me, Merry Gentlemen.
[11322.28 --> 11324.66]  Now, of course, we rewrote the lyrics with tech.
[11324.66 --> 11328.40]  Okay, so Jingle Bell's never got done by anyone.
[11328.56 --> 11330.74]  It just says, Jingle Bell's claimed not done yet.
[11330.80 --> 11333.02]  So people signed up for which song they would do.
[11333.04 --> 11333.96]  Oh, yeah, we had to write songs.
[11334.00 --> 11335.26]  Everyone had to write a song.
[11335.48 --> 11339.48]  And then I think I went through and did a pass of, like, kind of fixing them a bit.
[11339.72 --> 11339.90]  Yeah.
[11339.90 --> 11341.64]  So here we go.
[11342.46 --> 11345.06]  Deck Your Rigs by Colton.
[11345.66 --> 11348.00]  Deck your rig with silent cooling.
[11348.28 --> 11350.36]  Fa la la la la la la la la la.
[11350.86 --> 11352.96]  Tis the season to be greedy.
[11353.60 --> 11355.70]  Fa la la la la la la la la la.
[11356.60 --> 11358.04]  Yeah, that gives you some idea.
[11358.86 --> 11360.70]  Silent case, Nick.
[11360.70 --> 11362.84]  Silent case filled with fans.
[11362.84 --> 11365.24]  Running low RPMs.
[11365.88 --> 11366.82]  Blowing air.
[11370.30 --> 11373.58]  Dan's, like, cringing in actual pain behind the camera.
[11373.58 --> 11374.88]  I have worked with worst artists.
[11375.00 --> 11376.02]  This is pretty good, actually.
[11377.18 --> 11379.48]  I could stomach this for 70 hours.
[11379.48 --> 11383.60]  iPhone Lord Jobs did say
[11383.60 --> 11389.94]  that the patents he filed were perfect that day.
[11390.98 --> 11391.78]  I just, I just.
[11392.84 --> 11395.16]  I just refreshed and we're over 50 now.
[11395.50 --> 11396.10]  Oh, no.
[11396.18 --> 11396.68]  I'm remastering it.
[11396.68 --> 11398.40]  So you just made $150.
[11399.10 --> 11405.04]  Yeah, not really, because a $3 transaction is, like, 20% fees.
[11407.68 --> 11408.24]  Oh, man.
[11408.24 --> 11409.20]  Oh, okay.
[11410.04 --> 11410.48]  Anywho.
[11410.64 --> 11413.14]  Why was it uploaded to Spotify two months ago?
[11413.14 --> 11414.72]  Well, because two months ago was probably Christmas.
[11415.02 --> 11416.62]  So somebody just did that.
[11416.62 --> 11417.64]  Yeah, that kind of makes sense.
[11419.14 --> 11422.18]  Why does this have 28 monthly listeners on Spotify?
[11422.84 --> 11424.84]  I don't know, but that's awful.
[11424.98 --> 11426.66]  It's genuinely really bad.
[11426.76 --> 11428.80]  Yeah, it's as bad as what I just did,
[11428.86 --> 11431.30]  except I'm probably one of the better singers here.
[11431.30 --> 11438.78]  I was handpicked out of school when I was a young'un to join, like, out of school, like, primo choir.
[11439.64 --> 11444.62]  While I was there, the choir teacher said that I asked too many questions.
[11444.62 --> 11448.84]  And I don't know exactly what I said, but I said something along the lines of, that's stupid.
[11449.22 --> 11454.32]  Stood up, walked out to where my mom was, like, still sitting in the car in the parking lot and was like, we're done.
[11454.38 --> 11454.94]  Let's get out of here.
[11455.08 --> 11456.38]  And never went back.
[11456.48 --> 11459.32]  And then I hit puberty and my voice cracked.
[11459.46 --> 11461.86]  And now I can't sing at all.
[11462.20 --> 11462.46]  Nice.
[11462.46 --> 11463.84]  It's so bad.
[11464.12 --> 11464.52]  Nice.
[11465.04 --> 11465.86]  It's horrible.
[11466.94 --> 11474.74]  I'll, like, be singing along to a song in the car, and then, like, some map thing will happen, so the song volume goes down, I hear myself, and I'm like, whoa.
[11475.78 --> 11479.36]  So you've still got the ear, but you don't have the voice.
[11479.38 --> 11479.70]  Yeah.
[11479.92 --> 11481.62]  And then it's best to just do this.
[11481.80 --> 11482.00]  Yep.
[11482.40 --> 11482.80]  Yeah.
[11482.80 --> 11484.80]  Okay.
[11486.40 --> 11487.66]  Next up is from Nick.
[11488.04 --> 11491.04]  Hey, Linus and Luke, loving my LTT backpack and screwdriver.
[11491.26 --> 11493.18]  Kate, can't wait to see what's next.
[11493.60 --> 11498.46]  Linus, do you find that your kids' hobbies and interests are influenced by your work and love of technology?
[11499.00 --> 11502.46]  I mean, we definitely have a lot of tech in the house.
[11502.46 --> 11508.58]  And I think that, you know, when you're bored, it's not much of a stretch to be, like, video games are fun.
[11508.58 --> 11525.98]  And in terms of tech, though, you know, if anything, I think it can be an impediment sometimes because I'm so quick to kind of jump in and try and fix something because I just want it fixed that, you know, I think that there's room for me to make my kids do more problem solving on their own, too.
[11527.56 --> 11527.96]  Yeah.
[11530.54 --> 11530.94]  Okay.
[11531.00 --> 11532.10]  This one's from Richard.
[11532.10 --> 11532.68]  Hi.
[11532.80 --> 11538.20]  What do you make of Google's recent breakthrough in quantum computing error correction?
[11538.58 --> 11541.20]  Will we be seeing it in the wild anytime soon?
[11541.32 --> 11542.30]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[11542.42 --> 11543.28]  I am not a physicist.
[11544.38 --> 11546.28]  Soon, I seriously doubt it.
[11546.62 --> 11549.08]  I mean, quantum computing is going to be a hell of a thing when it hits.
[11549.24 --> 11549.44]  Yep.
[11550.74 --> 11555.66]  Also, I'm going to say it because he wanted us to show it, but I don't actually think showing the dashboard is a good idea.
[11556.14 --> 11558.52]  The facelift that happened in Merch Messages looks great.
[11558.62 --> 11559.46]  Conrad, you did a good job.
[11560.84 --> 11561.28]  There you go.
[11562.54 --> 11563.44]  Recognition served.
[11563.62 --> 11564.22]  Thanks, Conrad.
[11566.22 --> 11566.66]  Okay.
[11566.96 --> 11567.86]  This one's from David.
[11567.86 --> 11569.74]  Thank you for years of great content.
[11569.96 --> 11570.84]  Question for you, too.
[11571.28 --> 11578.34]  If given an option and having an access to one company and their top secret project, what company would that be?
[11580.58 --> 11581.06]  Valve.
[11581.76 --> 11582.24]  There.
[11582.54 --> 11583.12]  I win.
[11584.08 --> 11585.30]  That's the best answer.
[11586.04 --> 11587.58]  Their top secret project.
[11587.84 --> 11589.68]  Could it be projects or just project?
[11590.52 --> 11591.68]  Whatever the best one is.
[11591.68 --> 11599.18]  You just get to see their one coolest top secretist project.
[11602.60 --> 11603.88]  Does DARPA count?
[11604.56 --> 11604.94]  DARPA?
[11605.30 --> 11605.66]  No.
[11606.32 --> 11607.06]  That's a company.
[11607.06 --> 11608.02]  I don't think it's a company.
[11608.38 --> 11609.26]  No, pick a company.
[11612.20 --> 11614.36]  I don't actually know, like, how they work.
[11614.36 --> 11621.22]  Why don't you just pick, like, Palmer Luckey's stupid defense company or something, then?
[11621.84 --> 11622.18]  Anduril?
[11622.38 --> 11623.20]  Yeah, they're probably working on something.
[11623.20 --> 11624.16]  Because I'm pretty sure it's...
[11624.16 --> 11627.16]  The reason why I know that off the top of my head is I'm pretty sure it's the sword from Lord of the Rings.
[11627.26 --> 11628.56]  I think it's named after the same thing.
[11628.66 --> 11629.18]  Oh, my goodness.
[11629.18 --> 11633.82]  Yeah, it totally is.
[11633.90 --> 11634.26]  Anduril.
[11634.54 --> 11634.90]  Got him.
[11637.32 --> 11637.80]  Nah.
[11638.12 --> 11639.30]  I'll be boring to say Google.
[11639.68 --> 11641.18]  Just because I want to see what...
[11642.78 --> 11646.72]  I am, right now, extremely interested in large language models, right?
[11647.08 --> 11652.28]  I want to see what they're capable of with, like, nothing holding them back.
[11654.12 --> 11654.72]  All right.
[11654.88 --> 11655.28]  Everything.
[11656.82 --> 11657.72]  I want to see it all.
[11657.72 --> 11660.34]  Okay, this one's also from Nick.
[11660.82 --> 11662.12]  Hi, from Melbourne, Australia.
[11662.46 --> 11666.42]  My gym had just installed adverts on the mirrors.
[11666.72 --> 11672.38]  What are your thoughts on paying for a gym membership and having to look at ads while working out?
[11672.44 --> 11673.24]  I would switch gyms.
[11675.74 --> 11678.24]  I don't go to the gym, so I guess I have...
[11679.06 --> 11681.98]  I can't imagine that I would like it.
[11682.46 --> 11684.96]  I would switch gyms because you're supposed to be paying attention to your...
[11684.96 --> 11687.08]  You probably wouldn't care because you wouldn't see it anyways.
[11687.72 --> 11687.98]  Um...
[11687.98 --> 11690.28]  Just be honest.
[11690.82 --> 11693.02]  But, like, people are supposed to...
[11693.78 --> 11696.16]  Yes, people use the mirrors for vanity.
[11696.62 --> 11697.08]  No problem.
[11697.18 --> 11698.58]  Don't care about that if you do it or not.
[11698.84 --> 11702.98]  But the mirrors are supposed to be there in a functional way so you can watch your form.
[11702.98 --> 11710.42]  If you're being distracted by an ad that is intentionally trying to grab your attention away, that's actually, like, not a good thing.
[11710.92 --> 11711.30]  That's fair.
[11711.38 --> 11713.78]  And I don't want the idea of, like, I'm pretty deep into a workout.
[11713.96 --> 11718.64]  My brain is wandering a little bit and I start staring at some ad and then I hurt myself.
[11718.64 --> 11719.06]  Like, no.
[11719.62 --> 11720.38]  I want to be able to focus.
[11720.54 --> 11721.00]  Screw off.
[11722.02 --> 11722.94]  I would switch gyms.
[11723.20 --> 11724.08]  I was just out of principle.
[11724.20 --> 11724.52]  I'm gone.
[11724.52 --> 11726.78]  By the way, um, the...
[11726.78 --> 11730.08]  Did you watch the worst tech ads video by any chance?
[11730.48 --> 11731.18]  Yes, actually.
[11731.54 --> 11733.12]  I'd seen a lot of those before.
[11734.18 --> 11735.56]  Some things never change.
[11735.56 --> 11741.62]  Yep.
[11742.36 --> 11743.24]  Yeah, when you...
[11743.24 --> 11745.52]  When Yvonne was like, why did you know it was MSI?
[11745.72 --> 11747.98]  And you were trying to explain, like, I just...
[11747.98 --> 11748.94]  I just do.
[11749.34 --> 11750.28]  I felt that.
[11750.50 --> 11751.06]  I was like, yeah.
[11751.42 --> 11751.90]  It's just...
[11751.90 --> 11752.84]  It's just MSI.
[11753.64 --> 11754.78]  It's just what they do.
[11755.34 --> 11756.30]  I don't know, man.
[11758.40 --> 11759.16]  Oh, man.
[11761.04 --> 11761.42]  All right.
[11761.50 --> 11762.00]  Next up.
[11763.12 --> 11764.28]  This one's from Elijah.
[11764.28 --> 11772.64]  I want to buy a QD OLED, but the S95B doesn't support Dolby Vision like my 4K Blu-ray player.
[11772.84 --> 11774.32]  I can't afford Bravia.
[11774.66 --> 11779.90]  In your opinion, what's the line between sunk cost fallacy and investing in an ecosystem?
[11780.98 --> 11783.22]  Investing in an ecosystem is bad.
[11784.94 --> 11785.10]  Yeah.
[11785.16 --> 11791.28]  But once you are invested in an ecosystem, I mean, basically, you just have to kind of go...
[11791.28 --> 11795.38]  How much money do you have?
[11795.44 --> 11796.20]  Because, like, if you're...
[11796.20 --> 11796.70]  Yeah, wait.
[11796.82 --> 11799.52]  Why are you buying an S95B if you can't afford a Bravia?
[11799.60 --> 11803.14]  You should just wait a generation when QD OLEDs will get way cheaper.
[11803.48 --> 11805.96]  Like, that's the actual solution.
[11805.96 --> 11817.14]  The answer is always wait and buy it secondhand or wait for the new one that is better because that will cover literally every outcome.
[11817.14 --> 11833.50]  So maybe if it's like stereo 3D or something like that and there doesn't continue to be new development, there will definitely be a period before it becomes a collector's item, like a CRT period, you could call it, where getting it will be extremely cheap.
[11833.50 --> 11837.48]  So you can either wait for a new one that's better and cheaper.
[11837.54 --> 11838.38]  It's technology, right?
[11838.40 --> 11839.10]  Like, it's predictable.
[11839.74 --> 11851.96]  Or you can wait and get it secondhand from someone who doesn't manage their money as well as you do because you're going to be smart like that.
[11852.08 --> 11852.30]  Yeah.
[11852.66 --> 11852.96]  Yeah.
[11853.56 --> 11854.58]  I was reacting to something in chat.
[11854.70 --> 11854.94]  Don't worry about it.
[11854.98 --> 11855.36]  All right, cool.
[11855.50 --> 11856.04]  Moving on.
[11856.14 --> 11856.62]  Next one.
[11857.60 --> 11857.80]  Okay.
[11857.86 --> 11858.62]  This one's from Hector.
[11858.62 --> 11862.28]  Linus, what is the story behind the katana you have on your fireplace?
[11862.92 --> 11866.14]  I've seen it in multiple videos and wanted to know if there's a story behind it.
[11866.40 --> 11869.84]  Also, any update on the LTT screwdriver holster?
[11870.56 --> 11879.86]  The story behind the katana is I was at the Richmond Night Market with Yvonne and I had always wanted a sword because I am a manchild.
[11880.14 --> 11880.40]  Weeb.
[11880.92 --> 11882.34]  And no, not that.
[11882.50 --> 11882.76]  I know.
[11882.84 --> 11883.46]  I have a sword too.
[11883.46 --> 11883.78]  Yeah.
[11884.04 --> 11885.16]  See, that's what I'm talking about.
[11885.16 --> 11891.22]  Like I was the kind of kid who would be like 13, like hanging out in House of Knives being like, ah, swords.
[11891.54 --> 11892.72]  I mean, they weren't even like real.
[11892.86 --> 11894.70]  I'm pretty sure they were decorative, but I didn't care.
[11894.78 --> 11898.82]  I just like swords, you know, like they're big and long and manly.
[11899.42 --> 11900.24]  They're swords, right?
[11900.32 --> 11901.72]  Like what's to not like about it?
[11902.02 --> 11904.60]  So I just liked swords and I was finally sort of an adult.
[11904.98 --> 11909.54]  And I was like, I don't have to ask my mom for the sword this time because she's not here.
[11909.54 --> 11911.66]  So I'm going to ask my girlfriend for a sword.
[11911.84 --> 11913.30]  She didn't actually buy it for me.
[11913.30 --> 11915.00]  I just wanted approval.
[11915.48 --> 11917.98]  And she was desperately in love for some reason.
[11917.98 --> 11919.98]  So she said, yeah, you can have a sword.
[11919.98 --> 11920.80]  And now I have it.
[11920.86 --> 11927.42]  And now it's on our mantle as a reminder that she has more love for me than since.
[11929.80 --> 11932.50]  I, uh, swords are just cool and stuff.
[11932.50 --> 11935.20]  And when my brother got married, he chose me as his best man.
[11935.20 --> 11943.12]  And I don't know how true this is, but I believe there's some history behind best man actually being originally best swordsman or best fighter.
[11943.56 --> 11950.76]  Um, so I brought a sword to his wedding with his, like, I asked him, obviously I'm not that guy.
[11950.76 --> 11962.82]  Uh, the photos that they have of mostly actually his wife standing there in her, like, full bridal gown thing holding this gigantic sword.
[11963.06 --> 11965.78]  It actually looks so sick.
[11966.02 --> 11966.18]  Nice.
[11966.22 --> 11967.42]  Like, they're super cool.
[11967.78 --> 11968.14]  I don't know.
[11968.34 --> 11968.48]  Yeah.
[11969.74 --> 11970.46]  But yeah, I still have it.
[11970.54 --> 11971.04]  It's dope.
[11971.38 --> 11975.70]  And it is Anderil, which is why I always remember the name of his company.
[11976.04 --> 11976.42]  Nice.
[11976.42 --> 11976.86]  Nice.
[11978.74 --> 11980.48]  Round pile and float plane.
[11980.74 --> 11983.06]  My love of swords versus my fear of knives.
[11984.38 --> 11985.00]  Love it.
[11985.36 --> 11985.56]  Okay.
[11985.72 --> 11985.94]  Sorry.
[11986.50 --> 11987.10]  No, no, no.
[11987.22 --> 11988.30]  Uh, next up's from Artem.
[11988.70 --> 11995.02]  I am currently studying for mechanical engineering and I have noticed that you have been hiring more people with an engineering background.
[11995.26 --> 11998.22]  What have they studied and done to make you hire them?
[11998.46 --> 11999.52]  They studied engineering.
[12000.58 --> 12002.14]  And then we needed engineers.
[12002.36 --> 12006.40]  I mean, we've never really had a need for engineering in the past because we're a media production company.
[12006.42 --> 12010.70]  A lot of people don't understand what kind of company we are.
[12011.36 --> 12017.56]  Um, like, remember I talked about how we got, um, that, uh, that offer to purchase a little while back, right?
[12017.60 --> 12018.54]  On Wenshow last week.
[12018.92 --> 12020.88]  Uh, we've gotten more than one.
[12020.96 --> 12024.54]  That was like a serious one where they actually had some idea what the heck it was they were buying.
[12024.54 --> 12043.36]  But we've had so many people reach out thinking that we're a tech company and like, you know, trying to offer, you know, possibilities for a partnership or like, uh, like I had, man, I had this, I had this one, uh, one guy approach me because his company, um, is like a trucking company.
[12043.36 --> 12049.38]  And soon there's going to be these mandates around, uh, like trackers and the trucks or something like that.
[12049.38 --> 12051.68]  And they were like, yeah, maybe you could co-develop one.
[12051.72 --> 12054.04]  I'm like, we are a media company.
[12054.40 --> 12054.50]  Yeah.
[12054.72 --> 12058.72]  Um, we're, we're not a tech company, but that's changing, right?
[12058.78 --> 12061.80]  With float plane and labs and creator warehouse.
[12061.80 --> 12068.68]  So we have a lot more need for engineers than we used to because before it was like, no, we need video editors and writers and creatives.
[12068.82 --> 12071.40]  Now we need more of the hard sciences, right?
[12071.66 --> 12073.68]  So, um, that's why.
[12075.48 --> 12075.96]  Yeah.
[12076.30 --> 12077.08]  Wait a second.
[12077.16 --> 12078.96]  Linus media group is a media company.
[12079.62 --> 12080.74]  Oh, no, right.
[12081.34 --> 12083.18]  Is it a Linus company too?
[12083.40 --> 12084.50]  Is it a group?
[12089.28 --> 12090.40]  Next up's from Michael.
[12090.40 --> 12094.50]  Uh, Hey Linus and Luke, I'm a systems administrator for a school district.
[12094.64 --> 12097.42]  How do you feel about one-on-one technology in education?
[12097.66 --> 12100.50]  Do you feel the benefits outweigh the cost and e-waste?
[12101.20 --> 12102.56]  I think it's one to one.
[12103.20 --> 12104.10]  One to one.
[12104.66 --> 12105.52]  I'm not actually sure.
[12105.56 --> 12106.08]  Sorry, what is it?
[12106.08 --> 12106.42]  To be honest.
[12106.76 --> 12108.94]  Oh, like one device to one student.
[12109.10 --> 12109.24]  Yeah.
[12109.52 --> 12109.68]  Yeah.
[12109.82 --> 12111.92]  Um, I guess one to one is a different, yeah.
[12113.60 --> 12120.38]  I mean, given that these people are going to have one device dedicated to them for their
[12120.38 --> 12121.98]  like entire life.
[12122.06 --> 12125.38]  As far as I can tell, I don't think this paradigm is going away anytime soon.
[12125.44 --> 12127.16]  It seems sensible enough.
[12127.16 --> 12128.38]  I think the issue is cost.
[12128.80 --> 12135.20]  Um, I mean, well, what we need is we need a way to make sure that these devices can be
[12135.20 --> 12137.82]  used over an extremely long period of time.
[12137.82 --> 12142.06]  I think framework has the right idea, but their Chromebooks are so expensive that they'd be
[12142.06 --> 12144.92]  uneconomical, uh, for a deployment like this.
[12145.32 --> 12152.18]  Um, I think that as, as costs continue to come down for something serviceable, we're not
[12152.18 --> 12154.32]  going to get around the, the e-waste problem.
[12154.32 --> 12159.96]  Um, other than, you know, the first are reducing or sorry, reusing whatever it is.
[12159.96 --> 12164.64]  No, we're not reducing anything, whatever, using it for as long as possible where we can
[12164.64 --> 12167.82]  do that, but it's still going to be an increase in consumption.
[12167.82 --> 12169.94]  So it is not the first R is what I was trying to say.
[12171.04 --> 12179.54]  Um, yeah, I just want to see longer lifespans, I guess, but I don't inherently think that sharing
[12179.54 --> 12186.54]  a computer, you know, with my, with my classmates was particularly beneficial in typing class.
[12186.54 --> 12188.08]  Like we just kind of should have both had one.
[12188.18 --> 12188.52]  I don't know.
[12190.72 --> 12191.08]  Yeah.
[12191.20 --> 12195.92]  My only concern is school districts that would definitely in no way be able to afford it,
[12195.98 --> 12196.60]  which is a thing.
[12197.50 --> 12199.28]  Um, so we need more money in education.
[12199.48 --> 12199.78]  Yeah.
[12199.86 --> 12206.58]  See, I, I, I, I don't think we have the same, um, issues around district to district funding
[12206.58 --> 12209.46]  as I, as I know are very common down South.
[12209.98 --> 12215.14]  I know my, like in the boonies high school was like broke as all heck.
[12215.14 --> 12224.14]  Have I told you the story of one of the reasons why one of the best things like ever, I, I'll
[12224.14 --> 12226.40]  just say his name because he's awesome.
[12226.40 --> 12227.90]  And I believe he's a principal now.
[12228.20 --> 12229.82]  Uh, but my computer teacher, Mr.
[12229.88 --> 12235.16]  Trattle did a lot of things for me that were like very foundational in my opinion.
[12235.28 --> 12235.50]  Right.
[12235.56 --> 12239.50]  But one of the things that he did, maybe he doesn't want to tell me the story, but I'm
[12239.50 --> 12240.10]  going to go for it.
[12240.10 --> 12240.48]  Here we go.
[12240.48 --> 12247.12]  Um, he convinced a bunch of trucks that were going around to other school districts, picking
[12247.12 --> 12251.68]  up old computers, old computers, old monitors, old computer parts, whatever, and taking them
[12251.68 --> 12254.54]  to a recycling facility to come by our school.
[12254.94 --> 12260.04]  Um, but just like leave it there for a little bit and then they could take our stuff and
[12260.04 --> 12260.40]  take off.
[12260.40 --> 12265.20]  And what actually happened was when the guy wasn't with the truck, all the computer students
[12265.20 --> 12271.92]  ran out and like basically grabbed everything they could off the truck and ran it into one
[12271.92 --> 12273.52]  specific classroom and then left it there.
[12274.06 --> 12276.64]  So we had like all this e-way stuff.
[12276.98 --> 12277.88]  None of the computers worked.
[12278.44 --> 12278.48]  Right.
[12278.48 --> 12285.82]  And then it was a project in the class to go through all these computers, verify what
[12285.82 --> 12288.86]  components worked and build computers.
[12289.04 --> 12290.92]  And we built an entire classroom.
[12291.06 --> 12291.48]  That's cool.
[12291.92 --> 12298.10]  It was such an incredibly cool and fun project for a bunch of kids that like, yeah, a decent
[12298.10 --> 12300.46]  amount of kids in my school had computers at home, but not all of them.
[12300.74 --> 12301.34]  No, for sure.
[12301.68 --> 12301.78]  Yeah.
[12301.84 --> 12307.00]  And you're not going to be allowed to just rip apart random computers in class because we
[12307.00 --> 12307.96]  only have so many.
[12307.96 --> 12311.56]  Now we had a bunch of spare parts to keep the rest of the labs up and going.
[12311.72 --> 12317.08]  We got a new lab and you had all these kids that had some form of ownership over these
[12317.08 --> 12320.04]  PCs because they made that.
[12320.16 --> 12320.44]  Yeah.
[12320.64 --> 12323.44]  Which we would have never had the ability to do that.
[12323.64 --> 12325.36]  Oh, a bunch of people are saying, dude, that's awesome.
[12325.66 --> 12328.72]  Mr. Trattle was an absolutely insanely fantastic computers teacher.
[12328.82 --> 12332.60]  He also like, he went to BCIT for a summer course.
[12332.60 --> 12337.56]  He did a course over the summer at BCIT and then took what he learned there and taught a
[12337.56 --> 12341.98]  brand new course that didn't exist in our school system before called 3D game programming,
[12342.16 --> 12345.02]  which was just an amazing course.
[12345.16 --> 12348.12]  And it was like diluted from what was taught at BCIT, whatever.
[12348.22 --> 12348.96]  It wasn't the same thing.
[12349.18 --> 12350.56]  But like he just...
[12350.56 --> 12353.26]  Passionate teachers are a game changer for their students.
[12353.48 --> 12354.12]  It was fantastic.
[12354.12 --> 12360.74]  I mean, I write for a living now and it's only because of my AP English teacher.
[12361.44 --> 12361.64]  Yeah.
[12363.40 --> 12368.90]  I had a very, unsurprisingly due to dyslexia and all these other issues, I had a very poor
[12368.90 --> 12370.54]  score in English for a really long time.
[12370.84 --> 12375.32]  And then I had one teacher that was just super inspiring and like believed in me and understood
[12375.32 --> 12377.94]  the problems that I was having, but was like, you're still creative.
[12378.02 --> 12378.90]  You can drive this forward.
[12378.90 --> 12380.98]  And just my average English just shot up.
[12381.06 --> 12384.50]  And then I took AP English with another teacher and it wasn't as good because he didn't share
[12384.50 --> 12386.82]  the same things, but I was confident at that point.
[12386.90 --> 12389.60]  So I was able to carry it through and still passed and did okay there.
[12390.20 --> 12391.00]  I don't know.
[12391.08 --> 12392.00]  That was amazing.
[12392.22 --> 12397.38]  I don't even know how I got on that subject, but that was one of the like coolest things
[12397.38 --> 12398.30]  I've ever taken a part of.
[12398.66 --> 12404.24]  Watching everyone else in the class just be so excited every time a part would pass.
[12404.44 --> 12404.72]  Yeah.
[12405.24 --> 12405.46]  Yeah.
[12405.46 --> 12408.74]  And we had to, we, we didn't know if a single component worked.
[12408.80 --> 12408.96]  Right.
[12409.66 --> 12412.98]  So at the very beginning, everyone's trying to find like the first functional motherboard.
[12413.18 --> 12413.50]  Right.
[12414.90 --> 12418.64]  And then we use that to like pass all the RAM and like trying to figure all these different
[12418.64 --> 12420.26]  things out and like, that's a cool puzzle.
[12420.60 --> 12425.06]  And then when you would go into that lab to do whatever class, it might not even be a computer
[12425.06 --> 12428.50]  class, but you might need to work on computers for whatever reason, you'd know, like what the
[12428.50 --> 12429.44]  good computers were.
[12429.82 --> 12430.18]  Nice.
[12430.30 --> 12432.38]  So you'd like try to snipe the good one and stuff.
[12432.38 --> 12434.24]  Like it was just, I don't know.
[12434.26 --> 12434.96]  It was so cool.
[12435.26 --> 12436.28]  So, so, so cool.
[12436.96 --> 12439.08]  I might have some parts of that story wrong.
[12439.44 --> 12444.12]  My, whatever age I was when that happened, brain might have remembered it in certain slightly
[12444.12 --> 12445.34]  more fantastical ways.
[12445.48 --> 12448.30]  Like maybe it was totally above board how he got those computers.
[12448.48 --> 12449.20]  I don't know.
[12449.20 --> 12453.94]  But, but it was just incredibly fun.
[12453.94 --> 12457.40]  And I know that the project of like trying to pass good all these components and building
[12457.40 --> 12462.30]  all these custom computers is a thing that a lot of other schools didn't have that opportunity.
[12462.38 --> 12466.98]  And I know we did it because not only did we need another lab at the school and we couldn't
[12466.98 --> 12472.82]  afford it, but it was one of the coolest ways that he could introduce like hardware to
[12472.82 --> 12474.14]  a computers class possible.
[12474.30 --> 12475.72]  It was absolutely fantastic.
[12476.74 --> 12478.08]  Huge amounts of respect for him.
[12478.08 --> 12478.52]  Okay.
[12479.80 --> 12480.98]  Next up's from Russell.
[12481.34 --> 12482.90]  Oh man, I never know what to say.
[12483.80 --> 12490.22]  I wonder if Linus would write an audio, sorry, autobiography one day, or has it all been left
[12490.22 --> 12491.64]  out there on the interwebs?
[12494.36 --> 12497.96]  I went as far as, I think I have a title for it.
[12497.96 --> 12505.36]  Something, the story so far.
[12507.84 --> 12511.44]  Here, I'll read my four, or like, I'm not a four word because someone else writes that,
[12511.50 --> 12513.42]  but like whatever the like part of the beginning is.
[12513.42 --> 12517.70]  If I was a total sellout, I'd have structured this as an inspirational story about how anyone
[12517.70 --> 12520.92]  can do it if they try hard enough and a collection of tips to help you achieve what I have.
[12521.54 --> 12524.68]  But then if I wasn't interested in making money, I wouldn't bother writing a book at all.
[12524.92 --> 12527.00]  It's a pretty transparent cash grab from my perspective.
[12527.00 --> 12529.54]  That's been the fine line I've walked throughout my career.
[12530.16 --> 12530.88]  I'm not one of-
[12530.88 --> 12532.66]  That's a pretty good way to start.
[12532.76 --> 12536.82]  I'm not the kind of person who, either genuinely or otherwise, hides behind the I do this out
[12536.82 --> 12540.38]  of passion line from day zero when I was asked by my boss to start making YouTube videos.
[12540.48 --> 12541.04]  I've been paid.
[12541.90 --> 12545.96]  Now, to be clear, I was chosen for the assignment because of my genuine passion for technology,
[12546.02 --> 12547.62]  and I was only good at it because of that passion.
[12547.82 --> 12550.80]  But I never would have started making YouTube videos without a bonus on my paycheck.
[12551.24 --> 12552.32]  So back to the book for a minute.
[12552.32 --> 12553.36]  Why did I write this?
[12554.04 --> 12554.60]  For the money.
[12555.22 --> 12557.70]  But if I didn't care about creating it, it wouldn't be any good.
[12557.84 --> 12558.98]  So did I sell out?
[12559.20 --> 12560.64]  I guess you'll have to read it to find out.
[12563.74 --> 12564.34]  Seems good.
[12564.68 --> 12565.24]  Yeah, I don't know.
[12565.28 --> 12565.98]  I guess it'd be pretty good.
[12566.98 --> 12568.40]  But that's about as far as I've gotten.
[12568.54 --> 12569.82]  Well, no, I've written more than that.
[12569.92 --> 12571.20]  But I just-
[12571.20 --> 12572.28]  That's all you get for now.
[12572.34 --> 12573.18]  That's all you get for now.
[12573.18 --> 12574.22]  You gotta buy the DLCs to get more.
[12574.68 --> 12576.14]  Come to the free Christmas album.
[12576.14 --> 12583.72]  Okay, next up, this is an anonymous one.
[12584.12 --> 12585.70]  Hello, fellow Vancouverites.
[12586.18 --> 12588.32]  How does Linus survive without coffee?
[12588.84 --> 12592.22]  Also, is there any other plans for an LTT store not-com?
[12593.50 --> 12594.84]  I'll answer the not-com one.
[12594.90 --> 12595.62]  Yes, we're going to do it.
[12595.64 --> 12596.40]  The goal is this year.
[12597.08 --> 12597.26]  Woo.
[12598.44 --> 12599.36]  Okay, this one's-
[12599.36 --> 12601.54]  Well, you guys were asked a question.
[12602.12 --> 12602.90]  I was just-
[12602.90 --> 12604.78]  70 albums I've sold now, by the way.
[12604.80 --> 12605.30]  Oh, my goodness.
[12605.30 --> 12607.98]  Um, surviving without coffee is easier if you never drink coffee.
[12608.52 --> 12608.68]  Yeah.
[12608.68 --> 12610.98]  If you don't drink it in the first place, you're less dependent on it.
[12613.30 --> 12614.24]  It's literally a drug.
[12614.32 --> 12615.48]  You get literally addicted to it.
[12615.54 --> 12617.56]  If you don't drink it after a while, you have withdrawals.
[12617.66 --> 12618.66]  Like, it's totally a thing.
[12618.88 --> 12619.22]  I don't know.
[12619.30 --> 12619.92]  I don't drink it either.
[12620.30 --> 12622.82]  There are definitely days where it's been a little hard.
[12622.92 --> 12624.60]  And I've been like, I could.
[12624.90 --> 12627.56]  But then I'm always like, okay, that just makes future days harder.
[12627.56 --> 12628.60]  So I'll just tough it out.
[12629.20 --> 12632.48]  I'm not saying that's a good idea for everyone, but it works for me.
[12632.62 --> 12633.64]  It seems to work for Linus.
[12635.30 --> 12635.74]  Okay.
[12636.80 --> 12637.66]  This one's from Aaron.
[12637.98 --> 12641.60]  Spending B-Day cash on some stuff I've been eyeballing can hardly wait.
[12641.94 --> 12648.42]  With labs ramping up, has there been any tech or tech-related categories that you have decided not to test?
[12648.82 --> 12649.30]  Security.
[12650.36 --> 12650.84]  Yeah.
[12650.84 --> 12651.74]  We thought about it.
[12652.14 --> 12655.90]  We actually had an applicant that would have been really good for it.
[12656.34 --> 12656.74]  Yeah.
[12656.92 --> 12659.20]  But decided not to go down that path.
[12659.80 --> 12662.38]  And I honestly think that's probably the right way to go.
[12662.60 --> 12663.56]  You mean like software?
[12663.72 --> 12665.80]  Like antivirus software or something like that?
[12665.84 --> 12668.48]  Because that's one that I definitely said, no, forget it.
[12668.56 --> 12672.18]  It was mostly software, but it was a variety of things.
[12672.18 --> 12676.70]  Anything else?
[12677.72 --> 12678.56]  Man, I'm trying to think.
[12678.70 --> 12682.18]  Like there's stuff that I probably can't imagine we'd get that into.
[12682.32 --> 12689.60]  Like I don't see us, you know, getting really into the weeds on, you know, like generic Android set-top boxes or something like that.
[12689.66 --> 12692.32]  You know, like little like content piracy boxes.
[12692.62 --> 12692.82]  Yeah.
[12693.14 --> 12695.26]  I mean, it's just not really our jam, I don't think.
[12695.26 --> 12697.58]  We'd be focused mostly on things that can be measured objectively.
[12698.18 --> 12698.48]  Yes.
[12698.86 --> 12699.16]  Yeah.
[12700.78 --> 12703.18]  Our goal isn't really to inject opinion.
[12703.74 --> 12706.94]  So if it can't be measured objectively, it's going to be a little tough.
[12708.48 --> 12708.66]  Okay.
[12708.68 --> 12709.60]  Next up is from Aiden.
[12710.04 --> 12711.20]  Hey, Linus, love the content.
[12711.38 --> 12716.30]  I was wondering if there was going to be an LTT pocket knife multi-tool sometime in the near future.
[12716.46 --> 12717.80]  We are not working on that.
[12719.08 --> 12721.32]  I'm not saying we're not working on that.
[12721.32 --> 12723.84]  Like I'm sure maybe at some point.
[12723.84 --> 12726.38]  But at this time, we're not working on that.
[12727.28 --> 12728.74]  Yes, I'm wearing the swacket.
[12729.34 --> 12730.66]  It's the sweater jacket.
[12731.58 --> 12733.44]  It's not half sweater, half jacket.
[12734.46 --> 12735.28]  Half cool.
[12739.50 --> 12740.40]  Half cool?
[12740.92 --> 12742.02]  Yeah, that's it.
[12742.08 --> 12742.72]  Is it half uncool?
[12742.72 --> 12745.56]  I mean, it's LTT merch, so it's going to impress a certain kind of person.
[12745.74 --> 12745.94]  Yeah.
[12746.58 --> 12748.80]  Some people might not think it's as cool.
[12748.80 --> 12749.42]  Buy LTT underwear now.
[12749.96 --> 12750.50]  Yeah, exactly.
[12750.50 --> 12755.66]  I promise you, my personal Linus Tech Tips guarantee, it will get you laid.
[12758.56 --> 12761.50]  Please note, Linus Tech Tips guarantees are for entertainment purposes only.
[12762.28 --> 12763.60]  Can we get that on a shirt?
[12764.00 --> 12764.30]  No.
[12764.66 --> 12765.28]  Oh, my.
[12765.64 --> 12766.70]  Next up is from AJ.
[12767.14 --> 12773.12]  During your RAM tour, you weren't allowed to show some conversations about the 24 gigabyte sticks you got.
[12773.52 --> 12776.94]  Crucial has since announced 24 slash 48 gigabytes of RAM.
[12777.52 --> 12779.20]  Is that what you weren't allowed to show?
[12779.20 --> 12779.48]  Yes.
[12779.98 --> 12780.28]  Ah.
[12780.58 --> 12780.82]  Nah.
[12781.82 --> 12782.68]  Yeah, it's strange.
[12783.10 --> 12783.24]  Nah.
[12783.84 --> 12784.44]  It's boring.
[12785.76 --> 12787.32]  This next one's from Jacqueline.
[12787.48 --> 12793.70]  I think buying the LMG Christmas album should be available as one of our low-cost merch messages.
[12793.76 --> 12793.90]  No.
[12793.90 --> 12794.84]  Nobody needs it.
[12794.84 --> 12801.44]  I don't think that the LMG Christmas album matches the quality of other things that are on the LTT store.
[12801.76 --> 12802.00]  Yep.
[12802.00 --> 12803.52]  I think it will remain.
[12803.96 --> 12807.80]  It is a waste of power consumption to transfer those bits and bytes.
[12807.96 --> 12808.60]  Also that.
[12809.26 --> 12810.74]  Spending 90 hours on it.
[12810.84 --> 12812.80]  It's not worth the contribution to the strawberry.
[12812.90 --> 12813.56]  I can stop you, Ben.
[12813.56 --> 12814.20]  Anyone that gets out reference.
[12814.98 --> 12815.56]  High five.
[12815.96 --> 12816.84]  I suspect almost no one will.
[12816.84 --> 12818.38]  You may not work on it.
[12818.64 --> 12819.64]  I forbid it.
[12820.56 --> 12821.12]  All right.
[12821.16 --> 12823.44]  So we just got some potentials left in the incoming.
[12825.18 --> 12825.46]  Okay.
[12825.52 --> 12827.40]  Out of 10, how ignored was I just now?
[12827.56 --> 12828.30]  Pretty aggressive.
[12828.50 --> 12828.72]  Yeah.
[12828.78 --> 12829.06]  Okay.
[12829.06 --> 12832.00]  You cannot work on it on company time.
[12832.74 --> 12833.14]  No.
[12833.40 --> 12834.06]  At all.
[12834.18 --> 12837.04]  It is my copyrighted material and you may not work on it.
[12837.84 --> 12838.22]  I don't.
[12838.34 --> 12839.30]  I'm going to cover it.
[12839.62 --> 12840.82]  Oh, come on!
[12840.82 --> 12841.08]  Yeah.
[12841.08 --> 12843.40]  I was going to say, I don't think you can actually say that.
[12843.78 --> 12845.70]  Linus, can I please have a sync license?
[12846.52 --> 12847.54]  What's a sync license?
[12847.56 --> 12848.52]  I don't know what that is.
[12848.96 --> 12849.34]  What is this?
[12849.34 --> 12852.38]  Dan actually comes from the recording industry.
[12852.70 --> 12852.98]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12852.98 --> 12856.14]  He's going to dodge around me here.
[12856.52 --> 12857.18]  No, no.
[12857.36 --> 12857.88]  This guy.
[12857.88 --> 12859.86]  Okay, because you own the copyrighted material.
[12860.04 --> 12860.24]  Yeah.
[12860.34 --> 12868.84]  So under copyright law, I can release audio covers, but I can't release videos of me playing
[12868.84 --> 12869.40]  your song.
[12869.60 --> 12869.80]  What?
[12869.88 --> 12870.34]  Seriously?
[12870.74 --> 12877.68]  That's called a synchronization license and your song covers can't be put to video.
[12877.78 --> 12878.34]  It's very weird.
[12878.48 --> 12879.24]  It's very, very strange.
[12879.38 --> 12879.74]  Wow.
[12879.90 --> 12880.04]  Yeah.
[12880.34 --> 12881.26]  That's wild.
[12881.54 --> 12882.58]  That's really odd.
[12883.32 --> 12883.64]  Yep.
[12883.64 --> 12884.72]  Why does it exist?
[12885.66 --> 12886.42]  Music videos?
[12886.60 --> 12887.12]  I don't know.
[12887.18 --> 12887.46]  I'm guessing.
[12887.88 --> 12888.24]  It's strange.
[12888.54 --> 12889.36]  I'm literally guessing.
[12889.78 --> 12890.20]  All right.
[12890.20 --> 12890.72]  What else we got?
[12891.38 --> 12892.56]  We're into potentials.
[12892.70 --> 12893.80]  This one's from an on the mush.
[12894.66 --> 12896.14]  What watch does Linus wear?
[12896.42 --> 12898.04]  The gold one with the blue strap.
[12898.44 --> 12901.84]  Can we expect float plane exclusives on LTX?
[12902.16 --> 12906.90]  It's some Withings watch that I forgot to put on today, but I wear just because it's a
[12906.90 --> 12907.14]  watch.
[12907.18 --> 12908.88]  I don't use any of the smart features at all.
[12908.92 --> 12909.68]  I kind of give up.
[12910.48 --> 12912.06]  And yes, you can expect that.
[12912.06 --> 12913.28]  Yeah, I would suspect so.
[12913.46 --> 12913.58]  Yeah.
[12914.68 --> 12914.90]  Okay.
[12914.96 --> 12915.92]  Next up's from Aiden.
[12916.28 --> 12917.28]  Hi, long time fan.
[12917.92 --> 12919.04]  You used to...
[12919.04 --> 12920.80]  Sorry, there is a comment there.
[12922.32 --> 12923.88]  Hi, long time fan.
[12923.88 --> 12928.40]  He used to talk about wanting LTT store to take off as its own thing.
[12928.54 --> 12934.16]  Have you ever wanted to compare a week month of not shouting it out every video versus when
[12934.16 --> 12934.48]  you do?
[12934.70 --> 12934.86]  Nope.
[12934.96 --> 12935.58]  Can't say I have.
[12935.84 --> 12935.94]  Nah.
[12935.94 --> 12939.94]  Let's not.
[12940.06 --> 12940.52]  Let's not.
[12941.02 --> 12942.10]  This is from Shane.
[12942.22 --> 12942.66]  Hey, Linus.
[12942.72 --> 12946.62]  I remember your story of maintaining your SV650 instead of buying a Zero.
[12947.10 --> 12951.32]  Have you been able to get much enjoyment out of your bike since deciding to keep it?
[12951.58 --> 12952.98]  Bike nerd and fan of the show.
[12952.98 --> 12960.00]  I don't find much time to ride, but I am being extremely stupid right now.
[12960.00 --> 12966.74]  My bike is currently in a shop getting all of the paintable parts ripped off of it so
[12966.74 --> 12974.02]  that I can paint it like pink with iridescent green accent kind of depending on how the light...
[12974.02 --> 12976.92]  Yeah, the Lambo is now a motorcycle is sort of what I'm going for.
[12977.84 --> 12979.42]  I'm very, very excited.
[12979.58 --> 12980.56]  It's going to be...
[12980.56 --> 12982.32]  It's going to make absolutely...
[12982.32 --> 12986.94]  I could buy my bike probably a couple of times over for what I'm going to be spending
[12986.94 --> 12991.74]  making my bike look cool, which is probably the most frivolous thing I have ever spent money on.
[12993.66 --> 12995.18]  Okay, this one's from Steve.
[12995.76 --> 12998.86]  I know Linus was playing The Witcher 3 at one point on WAN.
[12999.02 --> 13000.12]  Did he finish the game?
[13000.60 --> 13001.22]  Thoughts on it?
[13001.46 --> 13002.58]  Played The Witcher 1 or 2?
[13002.84 --> 13007.64]  Thoughts remaking Witcher 1 open world with Unreal Engine 5 instead of the Red Engine?
[13008.36 --> 13009.22]  A lot of questions.
[13010.12 --> 13013.54]  I never made it past the tutorial because I got distracted.
[13013.54 --> 13017.76]  And all my gaming time has been Fantasian for a while.
[13018.66 --> 13019.84]  But I'm looking for something new.
[13019.86 --> 13020.68]  I kind of want to play Stray.
[13021.08 --> 13024.80]  That's like the one that caught my eye that I'm like, I want to do that because apparently
[13024.80 --> 13027.62]  it's a pretty short experience and I want something contained.
[13029.64 --> 13030.00]  Yeah.
[13031.06 --> 13032.78]  You're not going to get lost in the Stray meta.
[13034.32 --> 13035.44]  Next up is from Anonymous.
[13035.72 --> 13037.74]  Linus and Luke, what are your favorite flowers?
[13039.46 --> 13041.86]  Zelman CNPS 7000-CU.
[13043.54 --> 13044.52]  That's beautiful.
[13045.12 --> 13046.48]  Is that like a CPU cooler?
[13046.62 --> 13047.60]  It's called a flower or something?
[13050.20 --> 13052.50]  Yeah, this is some old school stuff.
[13052.54 --> 13054.94]  Oh my god, I remember wanting one of those so badly.
[13055.26 --> 13055.54]  Yeah.
[13057.24 --> 13058.20]  Without hesitation.
[13058.70 --> 13059.44]  I don't...
[13059.44 --> 13061.00]  You had that memorized, don't you?
[13063.28 --> 13063.68]  Okay.
[13063.96 --> 13064.32]  I don't know.
[13064.40 --> 13065.12]  I'm not super...
[13065.12 --> 13065.86]  I like plants.
[13065.96 --> 13067.12]  I'm not so into flowers though.
[13068.54 --> 13071.12]  I like having some greenery around your home though.
[13071.24 --> 13073.12]  Makes it feel less dead.
[13074.54 --> 13075.56]  Next up is from Eric.
[13075.94 --> 13079.78]  Hey Linus, have you had any more time with the GPD Win 4 after the short circuit?
[13079.86 --> 13080.08]  No.
[13080.62 --> 13081.02]  Okay.
[13082.30 --> 13084.80]  I'm still rocking my Ionio next.
[13086.00 --> 13087.54]  I just have all my stuff on it.
[13087.62 --> 13089.76]  It's like not because it's necessarily the best one anymore.
[13090.16 --> 13091.62]  Dan, you're just sending them into curated.
[13091.90 --> 13093.54]  I know because we've already done curated.
[13093.86 --> 13095.98]  It's easier than rejecting them and then archiving them.
[13095.98 --> 13096.70]  Okay, I understand.
[13096.88 --> 13098.34]  So the rest are like incoming.
[13098.46 --> 13099.98]  Do you guys just want to breeze through these?
[13099.98 --> 13103.02]  They're kind of like the third level of curation at this point.
[13103.52 --> 13103.88]  Okay.
[13104.00 --> 13108.38]  We had a lot of really good questions this stream.
[13111.18 --> 13111.84]  I don't know.
[13111.96 --> 13112.16]  Sure.
[13112.40 --> 13112.86]  You know what?
[13112.98 --> 13115.70]  I don't know what you did with that one.
[13115.80 --> 13116.66]  I blooped that one.
[13116.74 --> 13117.08]  Really?
[13117.20 --> 13118.08]  What's blooping it?
[13118.22 --> 13119.76]  I just sent it to screen.
[13119.98 --> 13120.48]  Oh, okay.
[13120.90 --> 13121.26]  I don't know.
[13122.06 --> 13122.90]  Verifiedbyverified.com.
[13122.96 --> 13123.36]  That's funny.
[13123.74 --> 13123.96]  Is it?
[13123.96 --> 13124.88]  What should that site do?
[13125.20 --> 13125.56]  Nothing.
[13125.74 --> 13126.26]  I don't know.
[13127.68 --> 13128.36]  And thanks.
[13128.46 --> 13128.64]  Yeah.
[13129.00 --> 13131.86]  This was a big career thing for me.
[13131.86 --> 13132.68]  Okay, I got an idea.
[13132.68 --> 13133.52]  I got an idea.
[13133.54 --> 13134.32]  Featured on MKBHD.
[13134.70 --> 13138.50]  You see like the first 30 seconds of that video was just us on the WAN show.
[13139.00 --> 13139.66]  What video?
[13139.70 --> 13141.34]  Yeah, Marques did a video on ChatGPT.
[13141.86 --> 13142.14]  Oh.
[13142.30 --> 13145.18]  And he doesn't even show his face for like the first half a minute.
[13145.40 --> 13147.06]  It's just you and me on WAN show.
[13147.16 --> 13147.62]  Oh, I don't know.
[13147.64 --> 13150.24]  Must have confused a good number of people.
[13150.78 --> 13151.38]  No, I haven't.
[13151.38 --> 13152.34]  Sorry, is this an ad?
[13152.80 --> 13153.16]  Skip?
[13153.64 --> 13154.64]  I should check that out.
[13154.64 --> 13155.36]  Or some KBHD.
[13155.86 --> 13163.00]  I constantly get frustrated, like deeply frustrated that people have these like revelations about
[13163.00 --> 13168.24]  ChatGPT or BingChat or whatever that are things that we talked about on like the first episode
[13168.24 --> 13169.42]  that we talked about it at all.
[13169.84 --> 13173.38]  And I'm just like, and I'll see it like blow up.
[13173.52 --> 13178.64]  Like it'll be like, oh, the top thing on Twitter is people figured out that you can like circumvent
[13178.64 --> 13181.06]  security things by convincing it that it's something else.
[13181.06 --> 13184.62]  Yeah, the first show I did filter bypass mode.
[13184.74 --> 13186.38]  It's just a different version of that.
[13186.58 --> 13187.38]  Get over it.
[13187.50 --> 13188.78]  Like, come on.
[13189.42 --> 13193.28]  I feel like people that watch the WAN show honestly probably feel the same way.
[13193.52 --> 13194.84]  Yeah, because they're in.
[13195.04 --> 13195.22]  Yeah.
[13195.36 --> 13196.06]  They're here.
[13196.26 --> 13197.06]  Yeah, exactly.
[13197.46 --> 13198.64]  They're on the inner circle.
[13199.66 --> 13201.12]  I had something to say, but I don't know what it was.
[13201.46 --> 13201.88]  Oh, right.
[13201.96 --> 13202.86]  What to do with that domain.
[13202.98 --> 13204.06]  I actually thought of something.
[13204.34 --> 13205.34]  I shouldn't have skipped it.
[13205.34 --> 13206.40]  Verified by verified.
[13206.60 --> 13206.76]  Yeah.
[13207.04 --> 13208.64]  You should figure out.
[13209.02 --> 13213.40]  You should be able to type in like, say, a company or a person or whatever, a handle
[13213.40 --> 13216.50]  that would be the same handle across a bunch of different platforms and figure out how
[13216.50 --> 13219.10]  much money they spend every month on verifications.
[13222.18 --> 13223.14]  All right.
[13223.22 --> 13224.06]  Thank you for that.
[13224.80 --> 13225.74]  It's pretty good.
[13228.24 --> 13229.96]  You make tech for a living, right?
[13229.96 --> 13233.80]  It wouldn't be that hard to do.
[13234.34 --> 13236.10]  That's one of the reasons why I like it.
[13236.36 --> 13236.66]  Okay.
[13236.76 --> 13238.38]  I guess we'll just start burning through these.
[13238.54 --> 13240.16]  Anthony says, podcast listener here.
[13240.24 --> 13240.88]  We are real.
[13242.02 --> 13242.34]  Yeah.
[13242.76 --> 13244.92]  Do you think the way we build PCs will ever change?
[13245.02 --> 13249.96]  I mean, Anthony, other Anthony, our Anthony, not you, did a really good video talking about
[13249.96 --> 13254.66]  how it's probably a matter of time before things get more integrated.
[13254.66 --> 13257.42]  And I think he's probably right in the longer term.
[13257.42 --> 13260.02]  Okay.
[13260.10 --> 13261.08]  And then I'll just archive.
[13264.20 --> 13269.10]  If you weren't in your position as tech gurus with access to limitless hardware, what do
[13269.10 --> 13271.54]  you think your hardware upgrade habits would look like?
[13271.98 --> 13273.30]  Frequency, performance tier?
[13273.60 --> 13278.50]  I was always a step down from top kind of person.
[13278.50 --> 13285.74]  So I'd be likely to end up with like your non-ultra version of a phone with your like, you know,
[13285.82 --> 13290.68]  3070, 3070 Ti sort of tier of GPU.
[13292.14 --> 13298.44]  Core i7, maybe probably Core i5, you know, whatever can be kind of overclocked or unlocked
[13298.44 --> 13303.36]  or hacksword in some way to get pretty much the performance of the top one, but at half
[13303.36 --> 13303.82]  the price.
[13304.68 --> 13311.00]  And in terms of frequency, for like PC gaming, I was an every gen kind of character for a
[13311.00 --> 13315.28]  long time, sometimes multiple times a gen just to try different stuff because I was
[13315.28 --> 13317.32]  constantly buying used and flipping.
[13317.50 --> 13319.08]  So it wasn't really like costing me anything.
[13319.54 --> 13322.70]  In terms of phones, I think I'd be a pretty infrequent upgrader.
[13322.70 --> 13329.24]  I mean, I went straight from the Note 9 to the Z Fold 3, whatever the stupid branding
[13329.24 --> 13330.10]  they have for this is.
[13330.72 --> 13333.04]  And other than that, my screen is cracking down the middle.
[13333.14 --> 13337.00]  I haven't really had any reason or temptation to upgrade this because honestly, upgrading
[13337.00 --> 13337.98]  your phone's a hassle.
[13338.38 --> 13339.16]  Yeah, it's really annoying.
[13339.18 --> 13339.58]  It sucks.
[13339.70 --> 13342.96]  I know it's not as bad as it used to be where you had to like go into the store to get them
[13342.96 --> 13345.00]  to transfer your contacts or whatever, but it's still...
[13345.00 --> 13346.64]  Logging into 10 million things still sucks.
[13346.74 --> 13347.64]  It's a pain in the butt.
[13347.64 --> 13355.76]  I haven't paid for the components of a mainline computer for myself since I was a teenager.
[13356.18 --> 13356.48]  Right.
[13356.68 --> 13357.64]  I'm in my 30s.
[13359.30 --> 13360.02]  I don't know.
[13360.56 --> 13362.50]  Whenever I'm like, this sucks.
[13362.60 --> 13363.68]  I'm lagging in this game.
[13363.94 --> 13364.90]  I just like bug Linus.
[13365.74 --> 13366.64]  It's pretty sick.
[13367.80 --> 13369.68]  To be fair, you get views out of it.
[13372.38 --> 13372.62]  Symbiosis.
[13373.10 --> 13373.54]  Yeah.
[13373.54 --> 13373.86]  Inaction.
[13374.14 --> 13374.66]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13374.66 --> 13378.22]  And phones, I'm an infrequent upgrader.
[13378.48 --> 13379.88]  Honestly, mostly.
[13380.08 --> 13382.68]  Not because I don't like want better battery life or whatever.
[13382.88 --> 13385.34]  I don't want to go through upgrading to a new phone.
[13385.60 --> 13386.78]  It's an annoying process.
[13387.00 --> 13387.12]  Yeah.
[13387.22 --> 13388.32]  And I don't use my phone that much.
[13388.32 --> 13390.20]  Your phone has to annoy you enough.
[13390.34 --> 13390.58]  Yeah.
[13391.14 --> 13392.72]  To overcome the annoyance.
[13392.90 --> 13398.46]  And over 90% of what I use my phone for is like work notifications or work messages,
[13398.46 --> 13401.68]  which is going to be like Discord, Teams, Slack.
[13402.30 --> 13404.26]  Those are going to run just fine.
[13404.26 --> 13408.78]  Overrules says, try saying, hey, assistant, set up my new phone.
[13408.86 --> 13409.76]  And it automates quite a bit.
[13409.82 --> 13416.20]  Yeah, but it doesn't automate all the stupid entering of passwords and 2FA and going in
[13416.20 --> 13422.08]  and adjusting my stupid Swift key, long press delay and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[13422.20 --> 13422.34]  blah.
[13422.34 --> 13428.94]  Like clearing out all the nonsense, unnecessary notifications that my app send me so that I only
[13428.94 --> 13430.34]  get the ones that actually matter.
[13430.46 --> 13430.60]  Yeah.
[13431.18 --> 13432.16]  Whisker app.
[13432.22 --> 13434.76]  I only care if the litter tray is full.
[13434.86 --> 13437.02]  That's literally the only thing you can tell me that matters.
[13438.02 --> 13439.06]  Stuff like that, right?
[13439.06 --> 13442.84]  Oh, right.
[13442.86 --> 13444.72]  I'm supposed to just keep doing this.
[13444.84 --> 13444.98]  Yeah.
[13445.04 --> 13445.74]  Just breeze them.
[13445.90 --> 13446.14]  Right.
[13446.32 --> 13446.64]  Okay.
[13447.74 --> 13448.92]  It's really hard to read.
[13449.00 --> 13450.54]  My mic is like right here and it doesn't matter.
[13451.32 --> 13451.96]  I'm sad too.
[13452.36 --> 13455.60]  Do either of you have a game that's coming out this year that you're looking forward to?
[13455.76 --> 13456.08]  Yes.
[13456.08 --> 13458.52]  Breath of the Wild 2.
[13458.64 --> 13459.56]  Looking forward to.
[13461.34 --> 13462.00]  Anticipating, yes.
[13462.42 --> 13465.16]  I thought I wasn't going to play Breath of the Wild 2 because I thought I was just kind
[13465.16 --> 13465.42]  of done.
[13465.50 --> 13469.14]  I never played the DLC, but then I fired it up for some reason.
[13469.20 --> 13469.40]  Oh, yeah.
[13469.42 --> 13472.18]  I was playing around with Switch emulation and I like fired it up and I was like, I'm going
[13472.18 --> 13472.64]  to play it.
[13475.50 --> 13476.58]  What is it even called?
[13476.68 --> 13477.70]  It's been so long.
[13483.22 --> 13483.58]  Anonymous.
[13483.86 --> 13485.38]  Currently looking for a job in the US.
[13485.38 --> 13485.86]  Starfield.
[13486.28 --> 13486.50]  Sorry?
[13486.88 --> 13487.28]  Starfield.
[13488.24 --> 13490.24]  Suffering through their atrocious visa policy.
[13490.36 --> 13491.80]  Have you guys hired immigrants before?
[13492.08 --> 13493.00]  Should they apply?
[13493.12 --> 13493.72]  How did it go?
[13493.98 --> 13494.62]  It's so brutal.
[13494.78 --> 13494.92]  It sucks.
[13495.30 --> 13495.92]  It's so brutal.
[13495.94 --> 13496.68]  It's the worst.
[13497.20 --> 13501.26]  People talk about how Canada brings in like a massive amount of immigration all the time.
[13501.94 --> 13506.50]  And it's like, yes, but also no.
[13506.60 --> 13506.76]  Yeah.
[13506.78 --> 13507.92]  It's also very challenging.
[13508.06 --> 13509.24]  There are a lot of roadblocks in place.
[13509.34 --> 13509.92]  There's tons.
[13509.92 --> 13512.58]  You can't just be like, hey, sup neighbor?
[13513.08 --> 13513.84]  Come on.
[13513.92 --> 13514.58]  Come on over.
[13514.58 --> 13518.62]  You live in, you know, Britain and the Commonwealth country or whatever.
[13518.80 --> 13519.56]  I guess that's chill.
[13519.68 --> 13519.84]  No.
[13521.36 --> 13525.38]  There are contractors that we work with that are outside of country right now that would
[13525.38 --> 13527.02]  like to be inside of country right now.
[13527.44 --> 13530.16]  And that's not changing for them, unfortunately.
[13530.16 --> 13536.32]  I found out on Wednesday evening that we have not paid Gary yet.
[13545.44 --> 13546.94]  Gary's the head of the lab.
[13546.94 --> 13550.70]  It has been for like six months.
[13551.16 --> 13552.14]  At least.
[13553.74 --> 13554.94]  That's brutal.
[13555.40 --> 13556.82]  So the reason is...
[13556.82 --> 13557.28]  Like at all.
[13557.90 --> 13558.98]  There's got to be somebody.
[13559.04 --> 13560.54]  You could do a contract thing.
[13560.68 --> 13560.94]  No.
[13561.30 --> 13561.52]  No?
[13561.62 --> 13561.96]  You can't.
[13562.32 --> 13564.08]  So there's a whole thing.
[13564.66 --> 13567.36]  Go to lunch with him or something and ask him about it.
[13567.36 --> 13569.00]  But don't worry.
[13569.28 --> 13569.88]  I already...
[13569.88 --> 13570.66]  Like I checked with him.
[13570.74 --> 13575.18]  I was like, hey, has Yvonne offered to lend you money in case you need it or whatever?
[13575.34 --> 13577.70]  Just, you know, under the table.
[13578.28 --> 13578.70]  Like whatever.
[13579.16 --> 13580.52]  And he's like, oh, no, no.
[13580.60 --> 13581.32]  Everything's fine.
[13581.46 --> 13582.14]  Okay, Gary.
[13582.62 --> 13583.10]  Anyway.
[13583.10 --> 13583.44]  I'm a champion.
[13583.88 --> 13584.14]  Yeah.
[13584.22 --> 13587.88]  Anyway, he's almost got it sorted out.
[13588.18 --> 13599.80]  I think he said he told me then that he should have his like personal number, like social security number equivalent in like three business days or something like that.
[13599.84 --> 13600.98]  So it should be sorted out.
[13600.98 --> 13604.02]  But the problem was A, getting him here.
[13604.16 --> 13606.20]  B, getting to be able to stay here.
[13606.56 --> 13610.62]  C, getting him the documentation that he needs to work.
[13610.62 --> 13615.10]  And it's just, yeah, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[13615.10 --> 13618.68]  So, yeah, we have not actually issued him a paycheck yet.
[13618.78 --> 13621.14]  And I was like, Gary, that's fucking ridiculous.
[13621.40 --> 13622.56]  We do need to solve this.
[13622.60 --> 13623.84]  And he's like, yeah, I'm working on it.
[13623.84 --> 13628.40]  I'm like, okay, well, you don't seem to have the appropriate amount of fire under your butt.
[13628.40 --> 13631.38]  So, like, I must insist.
[13631.50 --> 13632.82]  You must be paid for this.
[13633.44 --> 13634.74]  I know it's complicated.
[13634.88 --> 13635.94]  No, I was just bugging him.
[13637.28 --> 13638.90]  And no, he's not just waiting.
[13638.90 --> 13642.08]  It's been many different hurdles to jump over.
[13642.72 --> 13643.30]  It's been.
[13643.40 --> 13644.64]  No, I mean, like waiting on.
[13644.96 --> 13645.78]  Yeah, yeah, he is now.
[13645.86 --> 13646.04]  Yeah.
[13646.12 --> 13647.92]  But it's been shockingly stupid.
[13648.28 --> 13648.46]  Yeah.
[13648.84 --> 13649.04]  Yeah.
[13649.38 --> 13656.10]  And you'd think like, you know, America and Canada, lots of treaties, lots of general international cooperation.
[13656.90 --> 13658.34]  But a lot less than you'd think.
[13658.40 --> 13658.64]  Yeah.
[13658.72 --> 13660.34]  It's not as easy as you'd think.
[13660.58 --> 13660.80]  Yeah.
[13661.14 --> 13662.64]  Will Gary be making a fat paycheck?
[13662.80 --> 13664.30]  Well, I suspect that first one's going to be.
[13664.30 --> 13667.56]  Yeah, I bet that first one's going to be pretty hefty.
[13667.74 --> 13669.34]  A thick, thick boy.
[13670.16 --> 13670.36]  Yeah.
[13672.42 --> 13676.04]  What's a piece of tech you imagined as a small child that you still wish was a thing today?
[13676.04 --> 13677.94]  That I imagined as a small child.
[13678.06 --> 13680.76]  I mean, I imagine I wanted a lightsaber more than anything.
[13680.90 --> 13683.40]  And the Hacksmith's come about as close as anyone can, I think.
[13683.54 --> 13683.68]  Yeah.
[13683.68 --> 13684.12]  Yeah.
[13684.48 --> 13690.88]  I wanted a really, really fantastic version of a Nia, a neural impulse actuator.
[13692.98 --> 13696.28]  I've always been fascinated by different input devices.
[13696.42 --> 13702.42]  I think that's one of the reasons why I find VR so interesting, honestly, is the input ramifications more than almost anything else.
[13702.42 --> 13708.26]  I find things like Tobii eye trackers and everything else just very, very interesting.
[13708.68 --> 13722.28]  And I have always wanted the ability, without just like completely screwing myself over, which is questionable, to be able to have just like brain-to-device inputs.
[13723.12 --> 13724.36]  I've always thought that would be really cool.
[13724.36 --> 13733.38]  And I watched, there was a video that I watched recently of this lady using a much more modern version to do something.
[13733.70 --> 13734.42]  I don't remember what.
[13734.80 --> 13738.26]  And it was like, okay, this technology has clearly moved forward.
[13739.14 --> 13740.90]  Because her demonstration was fantastic.
[13741.28 --> 13745.48]  But it's still not like, it's not quite there, you know?
[13746.04 --> 13751.62]  Dylan asks, Luke, do you think you'd be a mid or senior in the market if you were looking for a job?
[13751.62 --> 13754.56]  I'm in an interesting position where I'm a senior at my job.
[13754.62 --> 13757.10]  But if I were to apply in the market, I'd probably be more like a mid.
[13757.50 --> 13759.98]  Depends what company you're applying at.
[13760.04 --> 13761.94]  Depends on the size of the company that you're applying at.
[13763.84 --> 13769.38]  I don't know how specific to go.
[13769.62 --> 13770.58]  But it depends on that.
[13770.80 --> 13770.90]  Yeah.
[13771.78 --> 13772.00]  Okay.
[13772.54 --> 13779.36]  Joey asks, there's in Seattle a store called REPC that recycles old PCs to fight e-waste.
[13779.36 --> 13784.64]  For how much of it there is, why do those kinds of stores seem to be disappearing rather than thriving?
[13785.18 --> 13790.30]  I think it's just because it's cheaper to ship it overseas than it is to process it here with North American labor,
[13790.46 --> 13795.68]  which is a whole complicated can of worms that I don't think we're going to open up right now.
[13795.94 --> 13796.18]  Yeah.
[13798.08 --> 13802.30]  Do you have a current recommendation for VPNs and or password managers?
[13802.46 --> 13805.70]  I believe, what are we migrating to for password manager?
[13805.92 --> 13806.26]  Keeper.
[13806.26 --> 13806.70]  Yeah.
[13806.70 --> 13811.38]  And I'm still using PIA, even though I don't know if it's like a good one.
[13811.48 --> 13817.14]  And I don't think there's any, you shouldn't trust any VPN because they have access to everything.
[13817.32 --> 13818.28]  Same with Keeper.
[13818.64 --> 13818.90]  Yeah.
[13818.96 --> 13820.80]  We're not telling you to trust Keeper.
[13820.92 --> 13821.10]  Yeah.
[13821.22 --> 13824.98]  It's the ship we're getting on, but we'll see how it goes.
[13825.08 --> 13825.24]  Yeah.
[13825.62 --> 13827.62]  I mean, we got on LastPass and look how that went.
[13827.84 --> 13828.04]  Yep.
[13828.46 --> 13828.78]  Woo!
[13828.82 --> 13829.84]  So like, it might suck.
[13829.84 --> 13837.32]  We are, the thing moving forward is we're going to try to be more ready if something like that happens again for us to be able to pivot to something else.
[13837.42 --> 13840.32]  But not using a password manager is not an option for us.
[13840.48 --> 13840.70]  Yeah.
[13841.00 --> 13841.82]  Or for you.
[13842.86 --> 13843.10]  Yeah.
[13843.58 --> 13844.34]  Like, use them.
[13844.54 --> 13844.76]  Yeah.
[13844.76 --> 13846.86]  Just be ready to move off quickly.
[13847.14 --> 13848.62]  Do some research into the company.
[13848.70 --> 13858.34]  Make sure that if they get super mega hacked, that hopefully your vault is going to be decently okay, even though your vault might leak.
[13859.00 --> 13863.00]  And then if your vault leaks, you know, move off, change all your passwords, move on.
[13863.06 --> 13863.60]  It should be okay.
[13865.74 --> 13866.10]  Wow.
[13866.28 --> 13867.40]  Bitwarden, there's a bunch of reasons.
[13867.50 --> 13869.50]  I don't want to like dive into this.
[13869.56 --> 13871.92]  I'm not surprised a bunch of you just said Bitwarden.
[13872.56 --> 13875.58]  And I'm not surprised that a bunch of you said Bitwarden because open source.
[13876.54 --> 13883.28]  One of our main reasons is in our testing, at least, and this isn't something that we like prepared for a video or anything, so relax.
[13883.28 --> 13889.28]  But in our testing, at least, we found that autofill worked better for a lot of the things that we use it for.
[13896.42 --> 13898.24]  Didn't think it was a good idea to tell people it would be used.
[13898.34 --> 13898.82]  Neither did Jake.
[13899.18 --> 13900.56]  It's going to be obvious at some point.
[13900.74 --> 13902.02]  Yeah, that's honorable enough.
[13902.16 --> 13904.92]  But I guarantee you within two weeks, Lannis is going to leak it anyways.
[13905.08 --> 13905.24]  Yeah.
[13905.36 --> 13906.36]  So it just doesn't matter.
[13907.92 --> 13911.18]  Security through obscurity, it's not super effective.
[13913.28 --> 13922.60]  Daniel says, if internet access seems to be the thing that always trips up AI systems and leads to them being unstable, what do you think could be done to mitigate the problem?
[13923.18 --> 13925.14]  I mean, not much.
[13925.22 --> 13927.02]  I think that's just...
[13927.02 --> 13933.32]  If you train something on human data, it's going to end up kind of human, warts and all.
[13933.84 --> 13935.34]  I'm glad your daughter loves the plushie.
[13936.50 --> 13939.16]  Greetings from Iraq, Eli says.
[13939.16 --> 13945.86]  Most unusual place to find out you have fans watching from and also most unusual country for you to visit or read about.
[13946.42 --> 13946.78]  Iraq.
[13947.86 --> 13948.30]  Really?
[13948.48 --> 13949.20]  Not Antarctica?
[13949.84 --> 13950.88]  Is that even a country, though?
[13951.40 --> 13952.08]  Or no, the place.
[13952.26 --> 13953.40]  The question was place.
[13953.50 --> 13953.64]  Yeah.
[13953.76 --> 13959.54]  We ended up having to retool some of the floatplane infrastructure because we had one viewer stationed in Antarctica.
[13959.86 --> 13961.26]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[13961.32 --> 13961.86]  That was a lot of...
[13961.86 --> 13964.92]  Yeah, like a research outpost or something stupid like that.
[13964.98 --> 13972.34]  So we had to figure out how to make sure their stupid video wouldn't stupid buffer in stupid Antarctica, which wasn't my problem, fortunately.
[13972.56 --> 13974.96]  But Luke and AJ had a wonderful time with it.
[13975.22 --> 13980.52]  Yeah, I don't even remember exactly what we did or whatever, but I remember addressing that a long time ago.
[13980.94 --> 13981.16]  Yeah.
[13981.16 --> 13981.24]  Wow.
[13983.96 --> 13988.72]  Caleb asks, I was really hoping to get the Orca VIP package for LTX, but I missed it.
[13988.76 --> 13991.46]  Do you feel it's worth the two-day pass as that's all that's available by now?
[13991.50 --> 13991.98]  Of course.
[13992.52 --> 13992.74]  Yeah.
[13992.82 --> 13993.64]  You should be there.
[13993.86 --> 13994.06]  Yeah.
[13994.54 --> 13996.04]  Be there, be square, let's go.
[13997.20 --> 13998.54]  Or be there and be square.
[13998.62 --> 13999.24]  That's fine, too.
[13999.32 --> 14001.74]  I mean, it's a big geek nerd convention.
[14001.86 --> 14002.36]  What can I say?
[14002.58 --> 14002.74]  Yeah.
[14003.04 --> 14003.90]  Just wear deodorant.
[14003.94 --> 14004.50]  That's all I ask.
[14004.68 --> 14004.80]  Yeah.
[14004.80 --> 14017.26]  Alan asks, for non-competitive gaming, watching videos, web browsing, would you rather have an ultra-wide QHD monitor, so what would that be, 3440x1440, or a 4K monitor at 60Hz?
[14017.52 --> 14018.98]  So the ultra-wide is at 100Hz.
[14019.04 --> 14019.66]  Oh, 100Hz.
[14020.50 --> 14020.98]  100Hz.
[14021.10 --> 14021.66]  60Hz.
[14021.74 --> 14024.26]  Refresh rate still matters even when you're just on your desktop.
[14024.28 --> 14025.12]  It's just responsive.
[14026.12 --> 14028.26]  It's like going back in time for me.
[14028.70 --> 14029.54]  It feels bad.
[14029.54 --> 14032.42]  But it feels like the old SSD upgrades.
[14033.18 --> 14037.44]  When you double your refresh rate, it just feels significantly better.
[14038.42 --> 14038.66]  Okay.
[14038.82 --> 14039.84]  I'm applying to this one.
[14040.96 --> 14044.06]  Thanks for making baby shower shopping easy.
[14044.68 --> 14048.10]  What are some things you had as a kid that kids today don't have and you wish they did?
[14050.42 --> 14051.20]  Not much.
[14051.20 --> 14056.68]  I think super soakers were higher quality when I was a kid.
[14056.68 --> 14064.90]  Oh, Screaming Blue Saucers were this cool Western Canadian candy that was super, super sour.
[14065.26 --> 14068.88]  And then it got discontinued and it popped up on Reddit a little while ago.
[14068.96 --> 14069.92]  People were talking about it.
[14070.08 --> 14072.92]  And I think the rumor is that it caused cancer or something.
[14073.10 --> 14074.14]  There was some kind of health concern.
[14074.18 --> 14075.04]  I ate a ton of them.
[14076.92 --> 14077.56]  That's unfortunate.
[14077.58 --> 14078.86]  So yeah, that's one of my favorite candies.
[14078.98 --> 14081.36]  I would love if my kids could try that candy and not get cancer.
[14083.12 --> 14083.48]  Yeah.
[14083.76 --> 14084.56]  I don't know.
[14084.56 --> 14090.72]  I remember my dad complaining a lot about how like candy quality had gone down since he was a kid.
[14090.76 --> 14093.00]  And I always just thought now your tastes just changed dad.
[14093.10 --> 14096.98]  But like wagon wheels when I was really young were awesome.
[14097.14 --> 14099.88]  And now they taste like actual dog food.
[14100.04 --> 14102.26]  I believe that's actually been like documented, right?
[14102.66 --> 14103.00]  I don't know.
[14103.02 --> 14103.16]  Maybe.
[14103.34 --> 14106.36]  Because whatever company made wagon wheels like got bought out by some other company.
[14106.36 --> 14106.54]  Sure.
[14106.64 --> 14107.10]  That makes sense.
[14107.10 --> 14107.66]  It's just the quality.
[14107.82 --> 14113.78]  And a lot of these different candy brands have just found that they can save costs in a variety of ways or whatever.
[14113.94 --> 14115.54]  That's been happening to a lot of different things.
[14115.54 --> 14116.64]  Like Honey Nut Cheerios, man.
[14116.70 --> 14121.22]  As much as MKBHD might have like built his brand on his love for Honey Nut Cheerios,
[14121.34 --> 14125.64]  the Honey Nut Cheerios that he eats tastes like dog s*** compared to what I had when I was a kid.
[14125.64 --> 14130.06]  Like before they changed the formula and they went like all whole grain everything,
[14130.24 --> 14131.54]  Honey Nut Cheerios were so good.
[14131.60 --> 14136.54]  I would literally sit on the couch and like watch the hockey game and like eat an entire box of them.
[14136.62 --> 14138.32]  I used to have them like every morning when I was growing up.
[14138.32 --> 14138.42]  Yeah.
[14138.46 --> 14142.26]  Like that young boy did not get to experience Honey Nut Cheerios.
[14142.40 --> 14144.10]  This is totally off topic and not part of the question.
[14144.22 --> 14149.88]  But something that I always find fascinating is the differences between Canadian and American versions of like the same thing.
[14150.64 --> 14150.86]  Oh yeah.
[14150.86 --> 14151.56]  Like Corn Pops.
[14151.56 --> 14153.90]  American Corn Pops is the weirdest.
[14154.44 --> 14156.52]  American Corn Pops are like terrible.
[14157.24 --> 14159.20]  Like I've actually grown to like them.
[14159.58 --> 14159.86]  Oh.
[14160.04 --> 14160.70]  Yeah, I know.
[14160.86 --> 14162.42]  It's an acquired taste for sure.
[14162.80 --> 14168.04]  The Canadian ones were, the Canadian ones peaked in probably about 2002.
[14168.38 --> 14170.38]  Yeah, back when they used to like cut your mouth.
[14170.52 --> 14171.58]  And I know that's going to sound bad.
[14171.58 --> 14172.76]  No, cut your mouth came later.
[14172.86 --> 14173.42]  Okay, okay.
[14173.44 --> 14174.98]  Yeah, so they were perfect.
[14175.24 --> 14176.68]  And then they cut your mouth.
[14176.84 --> 14177.08]  Yeah.
[14177.20 --> 14180.38]  And then they went sogtastic or it might have been the other way.
[14180.38 --> 14180.62]  That was bad.
[14180.62 --> 14181.02]  Yeah.
[14181.02 --> 14182.64]  And then they just like never improved.
[14182.74 --> 14183.94]  I haven't actually had them in a long time.
[14183.96 --> 14184.22]  Me neither.
[14184.22 --> 14184.82]  Maybe they're better now.
[14184.98 --> 14186.96]  But, or maybe they went back to cutting your mouth.
[14187.04 --> 14187.34]  I don't know.
[14187.46 --> 14187.88]  But they were like.
[14187.96 --> 14188.44]  Pre-cut your mouth.
[14188.52 --> 14189.60]  Even during cut your mouth.
[14189.74 --> 14190.96]  But pre-cut your mouth especially.
[14191.42 --> 14192.56]  Those, oh my goodness.
[14192.76 --> 14193.32]  So good.
[14193.36 --> 14193.56]  Peak.
[14193.70 --> 14194.22]  And then, man.
[14194.22 --> 14194.54]  So good.
[14194.88 --> 14199.28]  Man, when they were like hard as glass, it was an experience.
[14199.62 --> 14200.68]  It still tasted good though.
[14200.70 --> 14200.84]  Yeah.
[14201.04 --> 14201.66]  It's all the flavor.
[14201.78 --> 14202.40]  Just the texture was good.
[14202.40 --> 14204.22]  But then the flavor went away.
[14204.40 --> 14204.50]  Yes.
[14204.50 --> 14206.76]  Because I guess they just weren't putting enough glaze on them after.
[14206.76 --> 14208.40]  And they just got soggy instantly.
[14208.72 --> 14209.36]  Absolute garbage.
[14209.36 --> 14210.14]  That got bad.
[14210.30 --> 14213.18]  And then there's Smarties, which up here.
[14213.26 --> 14213.72]  Are rockets.
[14214.10 --> 14216.60]  Look basically like M&Ms.
[14216.78 --> 14217.02]  Yeah.
[14217.28 --> 14219.94]  And then down in the States are what we call rockets.
[14219.94 --> 14220.26]  Powder candies.
[14220.64 --> 14220.86]  Yeah.
[14221.42 --> 14222.30]  Just weird.
[14222.66 --> 14222.98]  Yeah.
[14224.08 --> 14224.48]  Yeah.
[14224.76 --> 14225.30]  Good stuff.
[14225.42 --> 14225.44]  Yeah.
[14225.44 --> 14226.86]  Tynan just brought up the exact same thing.
[14226.86 --> 14227.28]  Oh, yeah.
[14227.44 --> 14229.46]  Joe Scallon over in float plane chat.
[14229.64 --> 14230.68]  Toys and cereal boxes.
[14231.08 --> 14232.76]  Video games and cereal boxes.
[14233.56 --> 14234.54]  That was sick.
[14234.56 --> 14235.88]  Oh, demo discs.
[14236.20 --> 14236.48]  Yeah.
[14236.56 --> 14237.60]  That'll be my thing.
[14237.70 --> 14238.38]  Demo discs.
[14239.80 --> 14240.94]  Demo discs are sweet.
[14241.80 --> 14245.26]  You know, they get like a magazine that had the demo disc in it.
[14245.26 --> 14254.58]  This might be a weird one, but I liked the flow of information more back then.
[14255.54 --> 14258.38]  The internet was around, but it wasn't as vastly used.
[14260.48 --> 14260.96]  More excitement.
[14260.96 --> 14267.66]  You weren't just like completely bombarded with all this terrible stuff all the time.
[14268.56 --> 14269.14]  You know?
[14269.34 --> 14269.82]  I don't know.
[14270.16 --> 14273.24]  But you could access the internet and it had a lot of information on it.
[14274.22 --> 14274.66]  Whatever.
[14275.66 --> 14277.42]  I'm just replying to some in text here.
[14277.78 --> 14278.98]  Blowing through a few more of these.
[14279.42 --> 14280.58]  Good morning, Wan.
[14280.84 --> 14285.58]  I have recently gone from $20,000 to $40,000 take home in under a year.
[14285.98 --> 14286.26]  Wow.
[14286.26 --> 14291.80]  How have you dealt with your meteoric rise in going from scraping by in the early days to being a real company?
[14292.22 --> 14299.02]  I got to tell you that I took a long, long, long time to really change my habits at all.
[14299.68 --> 14302.56]  And I know actually the same is true for this guy.
[14303.24 --> 14309.14]  And the reason for me was that even though my income went way up,
[14309.60 --> 14315.18]  the amount of reinvestment and debt that I was carrying went way upper.
[14315.18 --> 14317.96]  I was carrying a car for a very, very long time.
[14318.36 --> 14322.70]  And so, I mean, like I finally, I finally like bought the dumb car.
[14323.42 --> 14324.88]  Learned to love the bomb or whatever?
[14325.08 --> 14325.34]  Yeah.
[14326.30 --> 14335.04]  Realistically, I probably could have, I probably could have had a not Chevy Volt like a while ago.
[14335.04 --> 14339.88]  But for me, there were sort of internal goals that I wanted to hit.
[14341.32 --> 14348.42]  And just like feeling like I can actually relax about it a little bit, I think is what happened.
[14350.92 --> 14351.32]  Yeah.
[14351.56 --> 14353.34]  And he just doesn't spend money.
[14353.60 --> 14353.78]  Yep.
[14354.18 --> 14355.38]  I do have some costs.
[14355.38 --> 14359.20]  Like my body is like broken in a few ways.
[14359.24 --> 14362.88]  So I go to physio pretty often and stuff like that.
[14362.88 --> 14367.94]  But I don't get a lot of personal satisfaction from just buying things.
[14368.32 --> 14372.50]  I actually feel it very negatively pretty often.
[14372.70 --> 14378.00]  I don't mind buying like a quality thing that I know I'm going to use a lot.
[14378.22 --> 14378.36]  Yep.
[14378.36 --> 14381.64]  But then there's a lot of research that goes into that.
[14382.78 --> 14388.08]  And a lot of the time you'll find that like most of it's just junk.
[14389.04 --> 14390.48]  And then I'm not very interested.
[14390.66 --> 14393.00]  Like, yeah, I'm not going to go into specifics actually.
[14393.40 --> 14396.74]  But, and then I'm not very inspired to buy it anyways.
[14396.74 --> 14402.46]  But then when I do find something that I like research a bunch and then I feel really confident in buying it.
[14402.62 --> 14405.16]  And then I buy it and it shows up and it is really good.
[14405.52 --> 14406.82]  Like, yeah, I'm pretty into that.
[14406.90 --> 14407.48]  I like doing that.
[14407.48 --> 14409.02]  And it's nice that I can do that.
[14409.64 --> 14416.06]  But like just going to the store and just like buying some random junk that I think is neat doesn't fulfill me.
[14416.10 --> 14416.74]  It doesn't make me happy.
[14417.36 --> 14421.56]  Any thoughts on whether or not MMOs that are shutting down should be forced to give up the server code?
[14422.18 --> 14422.54]  Yes.
[14422.74 --> 14422.92]  Yep.
[14424.60 --> 14429.62]  Has Linus seen his AI counterparts on Athene AI Heroes Twitch channel?
[14429.76 --> 14430.98]  It's eerily accurate.
[14431.62 --> 14433.60]  So I have heard about this.
[14433.60 --> 14436.40]  I didn't know that they made them for you.
[14436.40 --> 14439.20]  But I've seen some made for other people.
[14439.20 --> 14444.18]  And they are significantly higher quality than the ones that we reviewed on the WAN show.
[14450.18 --> 14450.70]  Sure.
[14455.58 --> 14456.10]  Yeah.
[14456.26 --> 14456.66]  One sec.
[14456.66 --> 14465.42]  Keep doing what I'm best at.
[14465.92 --> 14467.02]  Actually, I'm planning a...
[14467.02 --> 14467.18]  Hold on.
[14467.26 --> 14468.24]  So let's go back to...
[14468.24 --> 14469.54]  Hey, MKBHD.
[14469.82 --> 14470.54]  You're now an AI.
[14470.70 --> 14472.54]  Who is live on the Athene AI show?
[14472.54 --> 14474.54]  Taking questions from the chat.
[14474.64 --> 14476.46]  Anything you want to say to introduce yourself?
[14477.26 --> 14478.00]  Hey, everyone.
[14478.36 --> 14480.60]  This is Marks Brownlee, aka MKBHD.
[14481.22 --> 14484.96]  It's a little overwhelming to be asked questions while I now know I'm technically a machine.
[14485.48 --> 14487.06]  But I'm just going to keep doing what I'm best at.
[14487.06 --> 14488.00]  This one doesn't sound good.
[14488.04 --> 14489.96]  Actually, I'm planning a 10-bit HDR...
[14489.96 --> 14492.30]  For the stealth-like boner hiding operation.
[14493.36 --> 14494.44]  Stealth-like boner.
[14494.88 --> 14495.28]  Perfect.
[14495.28 --> 14500.48]  This one doesn't sound like you at all, either.
[14500.48 --> 14505.40]  Get your very own titanium-hammered wallet to hide your boner and keep your money safe and secure.
[14505.82 --> 14506.94]  Order now at...
[14506.94 --> 14508.70]  Well, okay.
[14509.06 --> 14511.36]  I guess that's a thing that just happened on our show.
[14511.40 --> 14512.24]  The Texas Wants is great.
[14512.44 --> 14516.78]  I've seen ones from him from other people where the voices are way more tuned in.
[14516.90 --> 14517.30]  Sure.
[14518.64 --> 14521.38]  Marquez's and yours didn't seem very tuned in there, in my opinion.
[14521.64 --> 14522.00]  Okay.
[14522.00 --> 14527.20]  Well, now that we've had that happen, we can do our last message.
[14528.02 --> 14528.64]  Evening, lads.
[14528.70 --> 14531.42]  Do you have a brand recommendation for battery banks, cables, etc.?
[14531.42 --> 14535.92]  I've been buying Anchor for nearly a decade, and I'm genuinely disappointed that I'll never buy their products again.
[14537.20 --> 14538.20]  I have not...
[14538.78 --> 14544.72]  We are going to be able to review cables and battery banks once the lab is, like, really going here.
[14545.28 --> 14548.20]  We are not there yet, so I can't give you a database recommendation.
[14548.20 --> 14555.04]  What I can say is that we've been working with YouGreen a fair bit lately, and we have not received any complaints yet.
[14555.38 --> 14558.18]  So that's always a solid indicator.
[14558.60 --> 14561.62]  We might find out they've got some dirty secrets down the road.
[14561.86 --> 14564.46]  Haven't seen any indication of that yet, though.
[14564.54 --> 14566.84]  Hoping for the best, but that's where we're at right now.
[14566.94 --> 14574.22]  So full disclosure, they're a sponsor, but that's the reason I'm bringing them up, is that we've been pushing them for a while, and we haven't seen any issues.
[14574.22 --> 14576.40]  Oh, sorry, one more. Dustin D.
[14576.80 --> 14581.42]  Love the pins. A few of my friends all bought the LTT backpack, so I've been looking for something to distinguish mine from theirs.
[14581.78 --> 14583.96]  Anything like LTT iron-on patches in the future?
[14584.06 --> 14587.90]  I do think we would like to do something like that, but I wouldn't recommend ironing anything onto the backpack.
[14588.38 --> 14591.22]  It's made of recycled water bottles, which means...
[14591.82 --> 14592.24]  It'll melt.
[14592.52 --> 14593.00]  It'll melt.
[14593.46 --> 14594.86]  So please don't do that.
[14595.96 --> 14596.76]  And that's it.
[14597.60 --> 14599.00]  We will see you again next week.
[14599.50 --> 14600.88]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[14601.34 --> 14601.66]  Bye!
[14601.66 --> 14601.92]  Bye!
[14601.92 --> 14606.82]  You know, early in the show, I thought this was going to end up being like a really short show,
[14606.90 --> 14609.88]  because we were like blowing through topics, and there was nothing to talk about,
[14609.96 --> 14614.76]  and then we got like a zillion merch messages.
[14618.68 --> 14619.54]  So much for that.
[14625.40 --> 14625.72]  Squarespace!
[14627.58 --> 14628.26]  JumpCloud!
[14629.18 --> 14629.54]  Nice.
[14631.92 --> 14633.22]  All right.
[14633.30 --> 14634.14]  All right.
[14635.64 --> 14635.92]  Let's go.
[14636.02 --> 14636.38]  All right.
[14636.46 --> 14638.10]  All right.
[14641.00 --> 14641.38]  All right.
[14645.38 --> 14645.86]  All right.
[14646.04 --> 14650.14]  All right.
[14650.38 --> 14650.44]  You're welcome.
[14650.50 --> 14651.74]  All right.
[14651.78 --> 14652.74]  Have fun.
[14652.90 --> 14653.72]  Take care.
[14653.86 --> 14654.86] róing happiness.
[14654.90 --> 14656.04]  All right.
[14656.04 --> 14656.86]  You're welcome.
[14656.90 --> 14657.36]  All right.
[14657.36 --> 14657.78]  Thank you.
[14657.94 --> 14658.88]  I'm not good.
