[0.00 → 2.16] And welcome to the WAN show!
[2.86 → 6.08] We have a fantastic show lined up for you today.
[6.16 → 7.08] A lot of great topics.
[7.22 → 10.02] I'm going to do my best to pick the two that Luke was planning on.
[10.70 → 14.62] Schools are struggling with AI as the academic year ends.
[14.76 → 15.24] Oh, crap.
[15.28 → 16.16] Failure so far.
[17.34 → 22.04] And a startup is offering free televisions
[22.04 → 25.14] as long as you consent to being spied on.
[25.38 → 26.58] You got 50%.
[26.58 → 29.44] This guy stepped down as CEO.
[30.00 → 30.96] That's a topic.
[31.86 → 33.52] I got to farm you for content.
[33.80 → 37.28] Chief Vision Officer would agree that you should be farmed for content.
[37.38 → 37.58] Okay?
[37.96 → 38.60] That's...
[38.60 → 41.58] I believe that's how that would go.
[42.14 → 43.82] Ah, man.
[44.10 → 44.38] Yep.
[47.24 → 48.20] Imager content?
[60.00 → 72.30] The show is brought to you today by Zoho One.
[72.62 → 74.58] Brilliant and kudos.
[74.58 → 78.68] Why don't we jump into our first big topic?
[78.92 → 79.26] You know what?
[79.32 → 83.08] I haven't actually done a Q&A with the float plane peeps yet,
[83.18 → 85.56] but I guess they can ask me some questions now.
[85.74 → 87.60] I'll do a stream a little bit later with you guys.
[87.72 → 89.18] I did say I would do that in the video.
[89.32 → 94.30] But in summary, if you somehow managed to miss the video that we uploaded yesterday,
[94.42 → 97.38] which I think is probably not a thing,
[97.38 → 100.70] because it has 4 million views or something like that already.
[101.30 → 102.52] Yes, it's true.
[102.66 → 107.76] I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group and all its affiliated companies.
[108.44 → 111.26] This isn't really a decision that happened overnight.
[111.48 → 113.80] I think for some people, they probably feel like it did.
[113.80 → 120.80] I saw a lot of people asking, like, was it the backpack controversy that precipitated?
[121.54 → 123.04] I'm sitting here going, no.
[123.34 → 123.52] No.
[123.78 → 127.42] No, I actually did not lose any sleep over the backpack controversy,
[127.92 → 131.24] or actually really any of the major controversies this week.
[131.28 → 134.06] I've definitely been, like, annoyed and frustrated,
[134.32 → 136.38] but no, I haven't lost any sleep over them.
[136.44 → 140.28] Because the thing is, I think a lot of people probably don't realize this,
[140.28 → 146.46] but I am inside my own head, and so I know if a major community concern
[146.46 → 148.92] is actually going to be a problem in the long term.
[149.12 → 154.84] And if it's not, then I just get to do what I'm going to do,
[154.90 → 156.94] and you guys will see, and everything will be fine.
[157.34 → 160.56] So I didn't lose a ton of sleep, even if some people did.
[161.08 → 165.84] But I would say that it's more just a cumulative effect.
[165.84 → 171.18] I mean, I think Luke could probably speak to this more than me,
[171.52 → 175.38] but I am not a detail-oriented person.
[176.36 → 182.22] And, you know, what's funny is that I can be very thorough in certain ways.
[182.44 → 186.28] Like, I can come in, even for something that I don't work with day-to-day,
[186.48 → 191.40] and I can go, hey, have you considered A, B, and X and Y ways
[191.40 → 193.50] that we could potentially improve the workflow here?
[193.50 → 198.40] Or, you know, from time to time, again, like, I'm not saying I'm some kind of genius.
[198.56 → 201.62] I think I'm above average, but definitely not genius.
[201.90 → 207.06] But I can come in and suggest something, even in fields where I have, like, no experience.
[207.54 → 212.54] Whether it's, and I think the solution we found for one of our upcoming screwdriver products
[212.54 → 214.36] was actually suggested by me.
[214.72 → 218.52] And it was one of my favourite moments ever, because I was like,
[218.52 → 220.50] Hey, Kyle, did we think of this?
[220.54 → 225.06] And he's like, no, actually.
[225.70 → 226.84] And I'm like, would that work?
[226.88 → 230.68] He's like, yeah, I think so.
[231.22 → 231.98] Like, yes!
[232.62 → 233.18] Got him!
[234.40 → 239.32] I can't remember a specific one, but I remember suggesting something, like,
[239.40 → 241.32] development-related to you at some point.
[241.82 → 245.10] And I was like, if this is dumb, feel free to tell me,
[245.16 → 248.30] because I know I couldn't write a line of code to save my life.
[248.88 → 252.52] And you're like, no, a lot of code is just math and logic,
[252.52 → 255.06] and that's actually a really logical way to solve the problem.
[255.16 → 256.32] And, like, that might actually work.
[256.36 → 259.98] I don't remember if we ended up implementing it, but it was, like, not stupid.
[260.22 → 261.28] But here's my problem.
[261.90 → 265.46] My follow-up on any of that is basically zero.
[265.46 → 271.50] My ability to document a new process that I come up with,
[271.54 → 274.54] whether it's myself or working collaboratively with someone,
[274.98 → 277.40] is basically zero.
[277.52 → 280.24] I mean, I remember James giving me a really hard time,
[280.34 → 281.78] because he's sitting here going,
[282.30 → 284.44] I'm trying to manage this writing department.
[284.78 → 289.16] I'm trying to create documents and processes and, like, training procedures.
[289.16 → 294.18] And what I'm finding is that basically,
[294.18 → 299.38] other than you just talking to people and brain dumping on them
[299.38 → 302.88] any time you see a problem, we don't have any.
[303.74 → 307.22] And I'm like, yeah, pretty much.
[307.54 → 309.02] I mean, it worked for you, right?
[309.08 → 311.32] He's like, oh, my, that's not the point, Linus.
[312.62 → 315.22] Because we have so many more people now, right?
[315.22 → 316.48] And it's...
[316.48 → 319.66] My biggest pain point is related to that,
[319.76 → 322.88] but essentially it's the transitioning from small to medium business.
[323.26 → 325.66] Like, disseminating information now is kind of hard.
[326.76 → 328.32] I even ran into an issue where, like,
[328.34 → 332.60] I need to look into if I can mute reaction notifications on Teams.
[333.48 → 335.38] Because I, like, posted that Flow plane updated
[335.38 → 336.70] and people should use it differently.
[336.82 → 340.46] And then my Teams was just constantly going off for the rest of the day.
[340.50 → 342.04] I was like, well, this is actually really annoying.
[342.04 → 345.82] Like, it's actually distracting at this point.
[345.98 → 346.76] Like, I don't know.
[346.92 → 348.94] I had something today where I...
[348.94 → 351.04] We had an issue with a shoot this morning where...
[351.92 → 353.62] Actually, no, I should back up.
[353.82 → 355.96] We had an issue with a shoot late yesterday
[355.96 → 361.10] where I arrived on set, and it was set up for a static A-cam
[361.10 → 364.70] with an operated B-cam on sticks, or on a tripod.
[365.18 → 367.30] And I was looking at it going,
[367.30 → 372.02] Hey, so I know that we recently reminded the writers
[372.02 → 374.16] and the production team
[374.16 → 376.14] that they're supposed to have a B-roll meeting
[376.14 → 377.98] before the B-roll is shot for a video.
[378.60 → 381.70] But it occurs to me that I don't think we ever formally said
[381.70 → 383.48] you can stop having an A-roll meeting.
[384.00 → 385.80] And clearly that...
[385.80 → 387.68] Well, did that happen here?
[388.24 → 390.12] And the answer was no.
[390.18 → 390.64] And I'm like,
[390.64 → 394.96] So you guys haven't looked at the script together yet.
[395.30 → 399.48] And it was mostly pretty new faces, relatively speaking.
[399.48 → 402.20] So it's not like I'm mad at anyone or anything like that.
[402.54 → 404.10] But it was pretty obvious,
[404.38 → 406.50] based on the kind of video that it was,
[406.90 → 410.14] that a static camera wasn't going to work at all.
[410.38 → 412.74] There were little things that I need to hold up
[412.74 → 413.74] and show to the camera.
[413.74 → 416.84] And then practical demonstrations that I needed to do
[416.84 → 419.44] that involved walking from one side of a table to another
[419.44 → 420.40] and plugging things in.
[420.40 → 421.16] I need to be ready for that stuff.
[421.40 → 421.64] Yeah.
[421.86 → 425.44] And the camera operator, again, relatively new.
[425.52 → 426.36] I'm not going to name any names.
[426.42 → 426.94] It doesn't matter.
[427.00 → 427.66] That's not the point.
[427.72 → 428.56] The camera operator is like,
[428.58 → 429.76] Yeah, well, I'm just going to follow you.
[430.32 → 430.74] And I'm like,
[431.08 → 434.38] Okay, but you got to think end to end here, right?
[434.60 → 436.32] What if I move in a way that's unexpected?
[436.90 → 438.70] Now we have a delay while you track me.
[439.04 → 440.82] We have a second delay while you focus.
[441.52 → 444.50] Heaven forbid you need to alter your zoom or something like that.
[444.50 → 446.78] Or we're going to be stacking delay upon delay.
[446.78 → 450.40] I'm going to have moved on by the time you've actually got me centred in the frame.
[450.90 → 451.32] And he's like,
[451.36 → 451.76] Oh, yeah.
[452.00 → 452.32] I'm like,
[452.64 → 455.52] So that's a challenge that we've got to deal with here.
[455.72 → 457.06] And what I feel like,
[457.14 → 458.36] That's kind of how I phrased it,
[458.40 → 464.24] Is that you guys haven't really synced up on how this is supposed to be shot.
[464.50 → 466.80] Because this is more than words on a page, right?
[466.86 → 472.32] This is a Bible for creating this video,
[472.32 → 473.64] Like this script.
[474.46 → 477.48] So what I want you guys to do is spend the rest of the day,
[477.98 → 479.76] Because this was pretty close to the end of the day.
[479.80 → 481.38] We would have barely been able to get it shot.
[481.50 → 482.98] So it's not like they were going to do this,
[483.00 → 484.04] And then we were going to finish shooting it.
[484.06 → 484.48] So I was like,
[484.52 → 484.74] Okay,
[485.12 → 486.20] Spend the rest of the day.
[486.28 → 487.48] I'll go do something else.
[487.52 → 488.20] Make myself busy.
[488.24 → 488.76] It's not hard.
[490.46 → 491.22] Go through it.
[491.28 → 493.30] And then we'll pick this up again tomorrow morning.
[494.96 → 496.06] I arrive tomorrow morning.
[496.06 → 498.14] So now the plan is,
[498.24 → 499.76] I believe,
[500.02 → 501.58] Still to shoot on sticks?
[501.94 → 502.48] No, no.
[502.56 → 503.26] The plan is,
[503.36 → 504.96] I don't remember what the plan is.
[505.32 → 506.46] But yeah, no,
[506.50 → 506.82] The plan,
[507.66 → 508.98] I don't remember the plan.
[509.16 → 509.96] The plan was bad.
[510.52 → 511.74] In a nutshell.
[512.38 → 517.78] Because we had created some props to do the demos that I was going to do from one side or the other.
[518.04 → 519.78] But the props were not applicable.
[520.34 → 522.62] And then I was supposed to do something where I'm like,
[522.62 → 524.04] I'm holding something up,
[524.04 → 525.80] And the cables that,
[525.92 → 528.74] Or the cable that connected it was so long.
[528.82 → 530.32] It was like a four-foot-long cable.
[530.56 → 532.96] That in order for me to show how it was connected,
[533.02 → 534.74] I would have had to have my arms like this.
[534.88 → 536.28] And the framing would have been so wide,
[536.32 → 538.08] You wouldn't have been able to see the things in my hands.
[538.62 → 539.22] And I was like,
[540.18 → 541.90] You know what I think just happened here?
[542.44 → 544.10] Is you guys have never done this before.
[544.28 → 548.66] And I basically just assumed that you would just know.
[550.04 → 550.76] Tell you what.
[551.60 → 552.48] Let's rewind.
[552.48 → 554.78] I'm going to do this with you.
[554.98 → 560.14] I will do the read through the script and show you guys what's in my head and why.
[560.52 → 563.30] So it needs to start on a close-up.
[563.38 → 566.72] And the reason it needs to start on a close-up is because the title and thumbnail is this.
[567.06 → 569.60] And we need to see this product right away.
[569.94 → 571.60] It needs to go wide.
[571.96 → 574.18] And that has to be done with a zoom,
[574.36 → 576.72] Not with a post-production punch-in.
[576.72 → 579.30] Because the previous shot needs to be quite detailed.
[579.84 → 582.64] Then, I'm going to talk for a little bit here.
[583.30 → 584.32] And this is too long.
[584.54 → 587.20] This is too long for me to be standing and presenting.
[587.50 → 588.88] So when we get to this point,
[589.02 → 590.60] We need to do some kind of transition
[590.60 → 598.52] So that I'm in kind of talking to you and showing you something rather than presenting to you.
[598.52 → 599.70] And that's really important.
[599.82 → 602.06] You've got to remember the way that people talk to each other.
[602.16 → 605.04] The camera is the eyes of another participant.
[605.26 → 609.22] And what is essentially just a one-sided conversation, if you think of it that way.
[609.22 → 611.40] Like, that's the point.
[611.62 → 613.40] That's the whole point of YouTube.
[613.96 → 618.66] Is that they're not necessarily talking to the other characters on camera.
[618.78 → 619.40] They can be.
[619.84 → 622.12] But it's for you.
[622.24 → 623.22] It's personal, right?
[623.56 → 625.82] And so if we're not engaging in that way,
[626.04 → 631.30] If you're not coming in close and tilting the camera down a little bit as I show you something,
[632.26 → 634.42] It's going to feel unnatural to the viewer,
[634.62 → 636.88] Even though they have no idea why.
[636.88 → 639.88] And so I did this little workshop.
[640.30 → 643.44] And the point, which I'm finally coming around to,
[644.10 → 646.98] Is that I did this workshop for like four people.
[648.06 → 650.20] And I realized after I was done,
[650.42 → 652.48] That there's at least another four,
[652.60 → 654.08] Probably more like another 14,
[654.46 → 655.56] That need to know that.
[655.88 → 656.92] And now it's lost forever.
[658.16 → 658.68] Whoops.
[660.36 → 662.00] So how do we fix that?
[662.26 → 666.24] Do I just like start selfie camera recording myself giving this workshop?
[666.24 → 667.86] Do we send it to everybody after?
[668.40 → 669.52] Sometimes, I mean, you know me.
[669.60 → 671.48] And sometimes I don't even know I'm about to.
[671.62 → 672.80] For Flow plane, we have knowledge.
[672.96 → 674.60] We have a thing called a knowledge base.
[674.78 → 677.00] But how do I get what just happened in it?
[677.28 → 677.46] Yeah.
[677.54 → 679.34] So in this case, you would have to record it.
[679.62 → 679.92] Yeah.
[680.04 → 681.66] And then you would put it in a knowledge base,
[681.76 → 682.44] Title it properly,
[682.50 → 683.82] And then people could look it up whenever they want.
[683.84 → 687.20] I don't always know when I'm about to do a knowledge base article.
[687.34 → 688.24] That's my problem.
[688.42 → 689.62] Well, it was one of my problems.
[689.62 → 693.64] You'd have to redo it at that point, pretty much, unfortunately.
[694.36 → 696.74] Because once you did it once, and you had that recognition that like,
[696.80 → 698.40] This is information people should be able to look up,
[698.48 → 699.28] Then you'd have to do it again.
[700.08 → 700.42] Yeah.
[701.84 → 703.48] But then he doesn't have time.
[706.86 → 707.22] Yeah.
[707.50 → 710.60] Only there was four people that you just gave a workshop to
[710.60 → 712.44] Who could pull their knowledge.
[712.44 → 712.76] Yeah.
[713.06 → 717.02] The thing is, I especially don't have time to redo the workshop.
[717.40 → 719.32] So I should do it once.
[719.68 → 722.26] But the problem, too, is that the meta is always changing.
[722.88 → 725.26] Like, if I record something like that today,
[725.42 → 728.70] I mean, some of it is usable forever.
[729.06 → 731.66] You have to plan for what the visual is going to be.
[731.72 → 734.82] You have to actually not just look at the script
[734.82 → 736.68] And make sure you've got everything on the props list.
[736.98 → 738.08] You've got to think about,
[738.42 → 741.20] What is he supposed to hold up when he's reading this paragraph?
[741.20 → 744.78] If somebody isn't standing right out of frame,
[745.10 → 746.84] Ready to toss it or ready to hand it,
[747.32 → 748.64] Then we have to stop the shoot,
[749.36 → 750.02] Get it,
[750.54 → 751.70] Get someone in position,
[752.04 → 753.26] And restart the shoot.
[753.44 → 756.24] That is incredibly disruptive to our workflow.
[756.40 → 757.94] And we waste a ton of time.
[758.06 → 759.70] With me arriving on set going,
[760.10 → 761.06] Hey, this is great.
[761.32 → 762.94] You brought this HDMI cable,
[763.24 → 764.90] But did you bring the adapter that we need
[764.90 → 768.04] To plug it into this ancient GPU that doesn't have HDMI?
[769.38 → 769.82] No.
[769.98 → 770.28] Okay.
[770.28 → 771.68] Well, I guess we'll go get that.
[771.76 → 772.26] Oh, no.
[772.34 → 774.34] Now we keep all our inventory over at the lab.
[774.44 → 777.28] It's going to cost us like 20 minutes to go get this thing.
[777.34 → 779.28] Like, we waste so much time.
[779.60 → 781.26] And so what I'm hoping is that
[781.26 → 785.34] If I can focus more on this type of thing,
[785.40 → 789.10] On helping people think visually, I guess,
[789.10 → 793.28] And, you know, more thoroughly,
[793.72 → 797.00] Then maybe, yeah, maybe I will be able to be in more videos.
[797.10 → 801.28] I've been in like two short circuits in the last two and a half months or something like that.
[801.28 → 802.38] I love short circuit.
[802.82 → 804.54] Short circuit is so easy.
[804.54 → 809.64] It's like YouTuber easy mode.
[809.78 → 811.62] The story is the product in front of you.
[811.62 → 813.00] It's like how Linus Tech Tips started.
[813.14 → 813.42] Yeah.
[813.62 → 814.82] It's like I could...
[814.82 → 815.52] Because it was easy.
[815.68 → 818.24] I could do short circuit in my sleep.
[818.44 → 820.60] And I actually, like, I kind of enjoy it.
[820.60 → 823.74] Because I can just sit and kind of experience the product.
[823.88 → 825.38] I don't have to think about hosting it.
[825.38 → 829.66] Like when I was doing the D brand Nintendo Switch,
[829.82 → 831.48] Tears of the Kingdom edition or whatever.
[832.18 → 833.30] I'm just having fun.
[833.34 → 833.80] I don't care.
[834.16 → 834.56] There was an era.
[834.60 → 837.88] Obviously, they were way worse than what short circuit is currently.
[838.00 → 840.38] But there was an era where we'd do like eight of those an hour.
[840.38 → 840.86] Yeah.
[844.46 → 845.52] Oh, man.
[845.76 → 847.74] They are going to be good, though.
[847.84 → 848.84] That's the other thing.
[848.98 → 852.80] Is I want my role as chief vision officer
[852.80 → 855.48] to be really focused in the early days
[855.48 → 860.08] on getting the lab and the writing team synergized?
[860.36 → 861.68] Because right now,
[861.78 → 865.22] the writing team is really great at creativity.
[865.54 → 868.40] I mean, like, okay, I'm not singling anyone out,
[868.58 → 871.86] but I'm going to give a gold star to Adam from the writing team.
[872.32 → 875.26] Like, that guy writes intros sometimes
[875.26 → 877.96] that I just look at, and I go, like...
[877.96 → 878.98] Where did this come from?
[879.00 → 879.18] Yeah.
[879.18 → 879.68] How did you...
[879.68 → 879.82] Yeah.
[879.88 → 881.70] Okay, like, he's the one who wrote
[881.70 → 886.92] the cheerleader thing for Chrome books or whatever,
[887.04 → 888.06] where we had, like, this...
[888.06 → 889.72] He wrote this cheer for it
[889.72 → 891.44] and everybody has pom-poms and everything.
[891.68 → 893.70] I'm looking at this going, like...
[894.58 → 897.90] I mean, I love it, but really?
[898.28 → 898.52] Yeah.
[900.76 → 902.04] And to his credit,
[902.16 → 903.72] he's actually pretty darn good
[903.72 → 905.20] when it comes to understanding
[905.20 → 906.66] the analytical side of things, too.
[906.72 → 908.18] He's actually done some perfect work
[908.18 → 911.56] that you guys will see eventually
[911.56 → 913.52] at some point
[913.52 → 916.04] with a new product release of some sort
[916.04 → 917.14] that will have a lot of graphs.
[917.68 → 919.12] Anyway, he's done some perfect work
[919.12 → 920.84] on graphing for us
[920.84 → 923.10] and automating taking in that lab's data.
[923.36 → 925.42] But the writing team, by and large,
[925.52 → 928.40] is really, really great creatively
[928.40 → 930.40] and really, really passionate
[930.40 → 931.84] about technology,
[931.84 → 934.06] but not necessarily
[934.06 → 936.64] as scientifically rigorous
[936.64 → 938.24] as the lab's team,
[938.32 → 940.70] which is made up of engineers, right?
[940.90 → 941.00] Yeah.
[942.08 → 943.56] Meanwhile, the lab's team
[943.56 → 945.16] is perfect
[945.16 → 947.90] at, like, nailing down process.
[947.90 → 949.28] They're trying to figure out, like,
[949.38 → 951.34] ISO, whatever the crap,
[951.52 → 952.78] and I'm just kind of sitting here going,
[953.08 → 954.82] I just want to know if it's loud, you know?
[954.82 → 959.28] But obviously, I let them do their thing
[959.28 → 961.02] because that's why we hire good people
[961.02 → 962.80] who want to ISO whatever stuff.
[963.58 → 965.60] The point is, you know,
[965.70 → 967.34] those guys are really great
[967.34 → 968.56] at being super analytical,
[968.98 → 970.96] but they don't always necessarily
[970.96 → 972.34] see the content
[972.34 → 973.92] in what they're doing.
[974.04 → 976.84] Like, the labs have given pushback
[976.84 → 979.22] on a concept where I wanted
[979.22 → 982.00] to just, like, grab the cheapest
[982.00 → 983.22] power supplies that we had
[983.22 → 984.10] kicking around here
[984.10 → 985.20] and see how many of them
[985.20 → 985.88] we could blow up
[985.88 → 986.98] with the power supply tester
[986.98 → 988.58] before we got the proper oscilloscope
[988.58 → 989.98] and all the training on it.
[990.20 → 990.76] And they're like,
[991.16 → 994.96] oh, but that's not very, you know,
[995.02 → 996.00] I'm like, I don't care.
[996.42 → 998.08] It's a sick power supply tester.
[998.22 → 1000.88] It's got a load generator module in it.
[1000.92 → 1001.88] Let's blow up some cheap power supplies.
[1001.88 → 1002.90] We can make power supply go boom.
[1003.14 → 1004.18] Yeah, it's going to be awesome.
[1004.96 → 1005.20] And they're like,
[1005.20 → 1006.56] oh, I really think we should wait
[1006.56 → 1006.88] until whatever.
[1006.88 → 1008.14] Which one blew flames the most?
[1008.16 → 1009.80] I mean, you could wait forever.
[1010.54 → 1011.40] You could wait forever
[1011.40 → 1013.22] to do things the moistest properly.
[1013.54 → 1014.82] I want to make content
[1014.82 → 1015.74] about the process.
[1015.96 → 1018.50] Like, did you have any idea how,
[1018.62 → 1019.26] do you have any idea
[1019.26 → 1020.92] how advanced Mark Bench is right now?
[1021.88 → 1022.66] Somewhat, yeah.
[1022.88 → 1024.60] Mark Bench is f***ING incredible.
[1024.80 → 1024.98] Yeah.
[1025.06 → 1026.58] And nobody told me anything.
[1026.86 → 1028.62] The last time anybody gave me
[1028.62 → 1030.08] an update on Mark Bench,
[1030.24 → 1032.60] it was just pretty much
[1032.60 → 1034.18] an auto hotkey script
[1034.18 → 1035.86] that would automatically,
[1035.98 → 1036.38] not quite,
[1036.86 → 1038.38] it wasn't much more sophisticated
[1038.38 → 1039.18] than that, though.
[1039.18 → 1040.42] This was back when they were
[1040.42 → 1041.52] still working upstairs here.
[1041.62 → 1041.86] Okay.
[1042.06 → 1042.30] Yeah.
[1042.30 → 1044.10] The last time anybody updated me
[1044.10 → 1044.74] on Mark Bench,
[1044.76 → 1045.32] it was pretty much
[1045.32 → 1046.38] an auto hotkey script
[1046.38 → 1047.50] that would just kind of
[1047.50 → 1048.88] cycle through the buttons
[1048.88 → 1049.32] in the menu
[1049.32 → 1050.52] to run a canned benchmark.
[1051.52 → 1053.72] It was pretty unsophisticated.
[1053.82 → 1055.08] It was something that I'm sure
[1055.08 → 1056.34] reviewers around the world
[1056.34 → 1056.92] have been doing
[1056.92 → 1058.42] basically since the dawn of time.
[1058.52 → 1059.40] Yeah, we got roasted for it
[1059.40 → 1059.70] and I was like,
[1059.74 → 1061.88] guys, this is not the end goal.
[1062.14 → 1062.80] Like, relax.
[1062.94 → 1063.50] Do you remember that?
[1063.70 → 1064.16] Do you know?
[1064.16 → 1064.92] That was so annoying.
[1065.20 → 1067.54] Do you know what it can do now?
[1067.54 → 1067.98] Okay.
[1069.14 → 1069.72] It uses,
[1070.02 → 1071.46] so there's a head unit.
[1071.54 → 1072.34] You guys are going to see this
[1072.34 → 1072.92] in more detail.
[1073.04 → 1073.62] You're going to see this
[1073.62 → 1074.42] in action
[1074.42 → 1075.72] in the upcoming labs tour.
[1075.90 → 1077.10] But there's a head unit
[1077.10 → 1078.42] that sits under the desk
[1078.42 → 1079.52] that right now
[1079.52 → 1080.94] is monitoring the output
[1080.94 → 1082.24] with like API.
[1082.62 → 1083.50] So what would the
[1083.78 → 1085.58] what's actually running the API?
[1086.70 → 1087.62] So that would be on the
[1087.70 → 1088.56] oh, you don't even know this.
[1088.56 → 1089.84] What are you saying right now?
[1090.34 → 1091.26] Are you talking OCR
[1091.26 → 1092.52] when it's reading the screen?
[1092.76 → 1093.22] Is that it?
[1093.86 → 1094.04] Yeah.
[1094.04 → 1094.22] Yeah.
[1094.88 → 1095.04] Yeah.
[1095.04 → 1095.18] Yeah.
[1095.24 → 1096.30] Something's running an API
[1096.30 → 1097.38] and something hooks in,
[1097.44 → 1098.52] one of them hooks into the other.
[1098.92 → 1100.30] So it must be the clients
[1100.30 → 1100.80] that are hooking
[1100.80 → 1101.80] into the server machine.
[1104.96 → 1106.08] I'm not entirely sure
[1106.08 → 1106.74] which part of the chain
[1106.74 → 1107.48] you're talking about right now,
[1107.54 → 1108.02] but I think so.
[1108.02 → 1108.16] It doesn't matter.
[1108.16 → 1109.40] The point is there's,
[1109.46 → 1110.32] there's a head unit
[1110.32 → 1111.14] that is monitoring
[1111.14 → 1112.14] the screen outputs
[1112.14 → 1114.32] of all three of the stations
[1114.32 → 1116.18] and can apparently scale beyond that.
[1116.36 → 1119.44] And it is basically looking for text.
[1119.78 → 1122.22] So OCR is optical character recognition.
[1122.80 → 1124.16] And what that does
[1124.16 → 1125.72] is it tells it,
[1126.24 → 1129.00] hey, there's an unexpected state here
[1129.00 → 1130.48] and it can log that
[1130.48 → 1131.82] and spit out errors
[1131.82 → 1133.00] and get this,
[1133.04 → 1133.86] it gets even better.
[1133.86 → 1135.60] it can actually use
[1135.60 → 1138.08] that optical recognition
[1138.08 → 1138.96] of what's going on
[1138.96 → 1139.56] on the screens
[1139.56 → 1141.10] to chop down
[1141.10 → 1142.44] all the footage we record
[1142.44 → 1143.34] of the benchmarks
[1143.34 → 1144.00] and gameplay
[1144.00 → 1145.30] so that either
[1145.30 → 1147.44] we could splice them together
[1147.44 → 1148.70] if we wanted to show
[1148.70 → 1150.32] actual gaming footage
[1150.32 → 1151.18] off of these cards
[1151.18 → 1152.20] for the final video
[1152.20 → 1153.76] or we could,
[1154.10 → 1155.44] or we could
[1155.44 → 1157.32] automatically edit them together
[1157.32 → 1159.60] if the lab's tech
[1159.60 → 1160.50] or if the writer
[1160.50 → 1161.36] wanted to just,
[1161.78 → 1162.06] you know,
[1162.12 → 1163.72] see if anything anomalous
[1163.72 → 1165.80] happened in terms of image quality.
[1167.12 → 1168.96] It's a very good idea to have.
[1169.04 → 1169.98] It's something that we've talked about
[1169.98 → 1170.58] since the beginning.
[1170.80 → 1170.92] It can,
[1171.06 → 1172.18] it does error handling.
[1172.44 → 1174.00] So if a benchmark crashes,
[1174.32 → 1175.04] it'll say,
[1175.24 → 1175.48] hey,
[1175.60 → 1177.32] we're on the main menu right now.
[1177.34 → 1178.14] That's probably not
[1178.14 → 1179.08] where we're supposed to be.
[1179.30 → 1180.76] It can navigate menus.
[1180.96 → 1182.70] So what we saw running
[1182.70 → 1183.96] is that now
[1183.96 → 1185.04] it can,
[1185.26 → 1186.46] so it can navigate menus
[1186.46 → 1187.72] and then it's a separate thing
[1187.72 → 1188.78] that is,
[1188.94 → 1189.98] that is also running
[1189.98 → 1190.54] on the head unit,
[1190.64 → 1190.96] I believe,
[1191.24 → 1193.14] that can handle input as well.
[1193.50 → 1196.08] So in our upcoming reviews
[1196.08 → 1196.74] of products
[1196.74 → 1198.16] that we'll have at some point
[1198.16 → 1199.46] that we'll have lots of graphs,
[1200.54 → 1200.80] NDA,
[1201.36 → 1204.02] we are going to have
[1204.02 → 1204.82] gaming benchmarks
[1204.82 → 1205.76] for games
[1205.76 → 1207.62] that do not have
[1207.62 → 1208.74] built-in benchmarks,
[1209.06 → 1210.74] which is so cool
[1210.74 → 1212.06] because we can just
[1212.06 → 1213.32] navigate the menu,
[1214.08 → 1214.98] open up a save,
[1215.60 → 1216.52] move our character.
[1216.68 → 1217.26] We've got it down
[1217.26 → 1217.72] to about,
[1217.78 → 1219.14] I think 1% is the target.
[1219.24 → 1220.50] I think we've got two games
[1220.50 → 1222.48] that are able to achieve
[1222.48 → 1225.12] within 1% run-to-run variance,
[1225.34 → 1227.20] which is so cool.
[1227.28 → 1227.74] And we don't have to,
[1227.80 → 1228.62] because we used to do this,
[1228.68 → 1229.36] but it was like
[1229.36 → 1230.24] an insane volume
[1230.24 → 1231.10] of manual work.
[1232.48 → 1233.20] No longer.
[1233.48 → 1233.76] Yeah,
[1233.88 → 1234.38] not anymore.
[1234.44 → 1235.84] And it wasn't as reproducible,
[1236.00 → 1236.66] whereas now
[1236.66 → 1237.34] the whole thing
[1237.34 → 1238.02] is being input
[1238.02 → 1238.96] by machine.
[1241.12 → 1242.04] That's pretty sick.
[1242.78 → 1243.46] No one thought
[1243.46 → 1244.56] to tell me this!
[1244.56 → 1245.90] We could have made
[1245.90 → 1247.10] an entire video
[1247.10 → 1248.28] about the progress
[1248.28 → 1249.30] on Mark Bench,
[1249.52 → 1250.56] and now it's just
[1250.56 → 1252.22] bundled into some lab update,
[1252.32 → 1253.28] which is fine,
[1253.48 → 1253.80] you know.
[1253.98 → 1255.42] We should do a lab update,
[1255.50 → 1256.66] and I guess now you guys
[1256.66 → 1257.72] get the information
[1257.72 → 1258.68] even more packed,
[1258.82 → 1260.18] but they are doing
[1260.18 → 1261.28] so much cool stuff
[1261.28 → 1261.84] over there
[1261.84 → 1263.82] that we are not
[1263.82 → 1265.30] making videos about.
[1265.30 → 1267.44] how often do you want,
[1267.54 → 1267.70] like,
[1268.36 → 1269.30] do you consider
[1269.30 → 1270.92] oversaturation?
[1272.80 → 1273.64] In what sense?
[1273.94 → 1274.18] Like,
[1274.24 → 1274.82] if we had
[1274.82 → 1276.84] two videos
[1276.84 → 1277.56] on various
[1277.56 → 1278.64] Mark Bench milestones
[1278.64 → 1280.36] between the last
[1280.36 → 1282.02] two things,
[1282.10 → 1283.06] between the last video
[1283.06 → 1283.76] we did on labs
[1283.76 → 1285.10] and this most recent update,
[1285.18 → 1285.96] is that too much?
[1286.72 → 1287.70] It's more that
[1287.70 → 1288.92] I think in the labs update,
[1289.04 → 1290.04] we wouldn't include
[1290.04 → 1290.66] Mark Bench then.
[1290.76 → 1291.26] We would just talk
[1291.26 → 1291.90] about other stuff.
[1292.44 → 1293.18] But Mark Bench
[1293.18 → 1293.56] could have been
[1293.56 → 1295.32] its own video for sure.
[1295.84 → 1297.26] And really what it comes down to,
[1297.34 → 1298.16] like how often
[1298.16 → 1300.08] we should release
[1300.08 → 1301.24] a new video about Mark Bench,
[1301.34 → 1302.14] comes down to
[1302.14 → 1302.80] title and thumbnail.
[1303.76 → 1305.48] If we have a title,
[1306.04 → 1306.76] you know,
[1307.78 → 1308.16] watch.
[1308.62 → 1309.86] So that would kind of
[1309.86 → 1311.00] require probably
[1311.00 → 1312.36] what you're saying,
[1312.68 → 1313.44] like more integration
[1313.44 → 1313.90] of you into
[1313.90 → 1314.46] what they're doing.
[1314.56 → 1314.82] Yeah.
[1314.96 → 1315.18] Yeah.
[1315.30 → 1316.34] So that I could tell them,
[1316.44 → 1316.62] hey,
[1317.00 → 1317.98] this is super cool.
[1317.98 → 1318.64] This is titleable.
[1319.16 → 1319.60] Yes.
[1319.66 → 1320.60] I can make this cliquey.
[1320.84 → 1321.16] Yes.
[1321.30 → 1321.46] Yeah.
[1322.18 → 1323.16] That's the key, right?
[1323.16 → 1323.96] Because that's what makes
[1323.96 → 1324.94] something a YouTube video.
[1325.08 → 1326.68] I don't need anything
[1326.68 → 1327.86] other than a title and thumbnail.
[1328.00 → 1329.22] And I can probably entertain
[1329.22 → 1330.58] for anywhere from
[1330.58 → 1331.98] nine to 15 minutes
[1331.98 → 1333.30] without too much difficulty.
[1333.78 → 1334.88] But what I really need
[1334.88 → 1335.70] is a title and thumbnail.
[1336.10 → 1336.86] So, okay,
[1337.08 → 1338.04] let's say that
[1338.04 → 1339.14] Mark Bench
[1339.14 → 1340.02] got more powerful
[1340.02 → 1341.96] and all of a sudden,
[1342.10 → 1342.24] oh,
[1342.32 → 1343.42] for the machine vision,
[1343.76 → 1344.94] it needs an upgrade.
[1345.78 → 1347.24] And by the way,
[1347.24 → 1348.30] we're going to parallelize
[1348.30 → 1349.14] all the benchmarking
[1349.14 → 1349.68] that we're doing
[1349.68 → 1350.84] to an even greater degree.
[1350.84 → 1351.98] And there's a couple
[1351.98 → 1352.76] of more harnesses
[1352.76 → 1353.34] for new games.
[1353.46 → 1353.96] I'm going,
[1354.16 → 1355.10] let's go.
[1355.36 → 1355.76] Okay.
[1356.42 → 1358.32] All the stations
[1358.32 → 1360.60] need to be up on a rack.
[1361.14 → 1362.82] And I've got a gaming headset
[1362.82 → 1364.12] on in the thumbnail.
[1364.50 → 1366.02] And I've got like a controller
[1366.02 → 1366.82] or a keyboard mouse.
[1366.92 → 1367.20] I'm like,
[1368.10 → 1371.14] I'm benchmarking 12 computers.
[1371.36 → 1371.50] Yeah.
[1371.60 → 1372.74] And they're all there
[1372.74 → 1373.14] or whatever.
[1373.52 → 1374.00] Boom.
[1374.16 → 1374.98] Easy, easy.
[1375.06 → 1376.04] People will click on that.
[1376.12 → 1376.66] No problem.
[1377.00 → 1377.94] And then we just explain
[1377.94 → 1378.52] all those things
[1378.52 → 1379.66] and show how it's all working.
[1379.72 → 1380.82] And we go through this story
[1380.82 → 1383.26] of how machine vision works
[1383.26 → 1384.30] and why we needed
[1384.30 → 1385.70] a more powerful GPU
[1385.70 → 1386.34] in order to run
[1386.34 → 1387.42] more stations at once.
[1387.54 → 1388.42] Why we didn't need
[1388.42 → 1389.42] a more powerful CPU
[1389.42 → 1390.88] or why we did need more RAM.
[1390.98 → 1391.52] What did we need?
[1391.56 → 1392.14] What didn't we need?
[1392.38 → 1393.32] How does the storage
[1393.32 → 1393.94] for all this work?
[1393.98 → 1394.66] How does the storage
[1394.66 → 1395.22] for all this work?
[1395.28 → 1396.02] Is it actually storing
[1396.02 → 1396.72] like screen recording
[1396.72 → 1397.30] from all of them
[1397.30 → 1399.14] or like what are we doing here?
[1399.14 → 1399.74] I believe so.
[1400.88 → 1401.70] To a certain degree.
[1401.70 → 1402.40] Okay, so we found
[1402.40 → 1403.00] this motherboard
[1403.00 → 1404.86] with 12 PCIE slots
[1404.86 → 1405.58] so we could fill it
[1405.58 → 1406.36] with capture cards.
[1406.44 → 1407.30] Like, I don't know.
[1408.06 → 1409.28] But let's tell that story,
[1409.44 → 1409.70] darn it.
[1409.72 → 1410.24] Because they need some amount.
[1410.38 → 1411.54] I think it might be temporal.
[1411.86 → 1412.46] I don't remember.
[1413.20 → 1414.08] I need to spend more time
[1414.08 → 1414.40] with that.
[1415.02 → 1415.38] Exactly.
[1416.58 → 1416.94] Exactly.
[1417.18 → 1417.70] They're over there
[1417.70 → 1419.10] doing the coolest stuff
[1419.10 → 1420.68] in this entire stupid building.
[1420.94 → 1421.56] Floatplanes have been
[1421.56 → 1422.50] pants on fire
[1422.50 → 1423.10] for a long time
[1423.10 → 1424.00] so I've been neglecting.
[1424.14 → 1424.94] Yeah, I get it.
[1425.04 → 1425.42] And I'm just,
[1425.54 → 1425.94] I'm not,
[1425.94 → 1427.74] I'm not talking about any of it.
[1428.70 → 1429.80] So, I'm excited.
[1430.14 → 1430.68] I'm excited.
[1430.68 → 1431.38] That's going to be,
[1431.48 → 1432.58] that's going to be really awesome.
[1433.70 → 1435.00] And I think that
[1435.00 → 1437.14] given that the lab
[1437.14 → 1439.34] is the biggest investment
[1439.34 → 1441.14] we've made into moat building
[1441.14 → 1442.38] pretty much since
[1442.38 → 1443.36] we started the company,
[1443.36 → 1445.02] if we are not
[1445.02 → 1446.72] utilizing it properly,
[1446.96 → 1448.78] that's going to be terrible.
[1449.46 → 1450.66] Oh, the reason I started
[1450.66 → 1451.68] talking about the lab though
[1451.68 → 1453.00] was what I'm really excited about
[1453.00 → 1454.38] is what's going to be happening
[1454.38 → 1455.14] for Short Circuit.
[1455.90 → 1457.50] Man, we are going to be able
[1457.50 → 1459.32] to do like eight minute
[1459.32 → 1460.54] power supply videos
[1460.54 → 1461.74] that are literally
[1461.74 → 1463.20] everything you could possibly
[1463.20 → 1464.04] need to know about it.
[1464.10 → 1464.88] Don't even bother
[1464.88 → 1466.40] looking at the manufacturing website.
[1466.54 → 1467.54] That PSU tester
[1467.54 → 1468.82] is so cool
[1468.82 → 1471.28] and the person
[1471.28 → 1472.18] who's been brought in
[1472.18 → 1472.96] to operate it
[1472.96 → 1475.06] has been really great
[1475.06 → 1475.90] so far apparently
[1475.90 → 1477.08] and we're really,
[1477.16 → 1478.42] really, really excited.
[1478.56 → 1479.36] It's going to be set up
[1479.36 → 1480.18] and ready to go
[1480.18 → 1481.14] hopefully in the next
[1481.14 → 1482.22] like few weeks
[1482.22 → 1483.60] and the first video
[1483.60 → 1484.30] we have planned
[1484.30 → 1485.04] is going to be like
[1485.04 → 1485.86] a sub $40
[1485.86 → 1487.14] power supply roundup
[1487.14 → 1488.34] because isn't that
[1488.34 → 1489.20] what we need to know?
[1490.44 → 1491.42] Like, yeah,
[1491.54 → 1492.80] with basic equipment
[1492.80 → 1493.70] like what a lot
[1493.70 → 1494.92] of other sites are using
[1494.92 → 1495.94] you can tell
[1495.94 → 1496.94] if it's going to
[1496.94 → 1497.78] immediately set
[1497.78 → 1498.74] your computer on fire
[1498.74 → 1500.42] but which one
[1500.42 → 1501.80] is actually good?
[1504.00 → 1504.62] Don't know.
[1505.00 → 1505.70] I don't know.
[1505.90 → 1506.26] Don't know.
[1506.40 → 1507.00] There's a bunch of that
[1507.00 → 1507.56] type of content
[1507.56 → 1508.36] that hasn't been,
[1509.02 → 1509.78] what were we talking
[1509.78 → 1510.34] about recently?
[1510.72 → 1511.36] Cell phones
[1511.36 → 1512.84] and their like
[1512.84 → 1514.54] signal stuff.
[1514.54 → 1515.22] Yeah, yeah.
[1515.62 → 1516.72] Who has better reception?
[1516.92 → 1517.24] I don't know.
[1517.30 → 1518.22] That used to be something
[1518.22 → 1519.14] that was in a lot
[1519.14 → 1519.86] of cell phone reviews.
[1519.88 → 1520.38] Oh, for sure.
[1520.44 → 1520.88] People would talk
[1520.88 → 1521.44] about it all the time
[1521.44 → 1522.06] and then it hasn't
[1522.06 → 1522.48] been a thing
[1522.48 → 1523.12] for quite a while now.
[1523.36 → 1523.60] Yep.
[1524.04 → 1525.26] Well, it was really hard
[1525.26 → 1525.92] to do,
[1525.92 → 1526.74] it was really hard
[1526.74 → 1528.94] to do repeatedly
[1528.94 → 1530.70] without really
[1530.70 → 1531.74] sophisticated equipment.
[1531.88 → 1532.00] Yeah.
[1532.30 → 1533.04] And I think that's
[1533.04 → 1533.50] one of the reasons
[1533.50 → 1535.02] why it actually faded away
[1535.02 → 1535.92] was a lot of the testing
[1535.92 → 1536.58] that was being done
[1536.58 → 1537.52] was kind of junk.
[1537.94 → 1538.18] Yep.
[1538.92 → 1539.36] So,
[1539.36 → 1540.22] so either
[1540.22 → 1541.20] stopped doing it.
[1541.28 → 1542.18] Either they were a site
[1542.18 → 1543.62] that or an outlet
[1543.62 → 1544.56] that didn't care
[1544.56 → 1545.38] and didn't bother
[1545.38 → 1547.00] or they were a site
[1547.00 → 1547.46] or outlet
[1547.46 → 1548.38] that did care
[1548.38 → 1549.00] and realized
[1549.00 → 1549.82] that what they were doing
[1549.82 → 1550.38] was worthless.
[1550.72 → 1550.86] Yeah.
[1551.74 → 1552.22] So,
[1552.42 → 1553.16] so goodbye.
[1553.72 → 1554.20] Yeah.
[1555.18 → 1555.66] Yeah,
[1555.72 → 1556.58] I'm really,
[1556.72 → 1557.58] I'm really excited
[1557.58 → 1558.58] about power supplies.
[1558.72 → 1559.54] We're really excited
[1559.54 → 1560.12] about what we're going
[1560.12 → 1560.76] to be able to do
[1560.76 → 1561.74] with RF men.
[1562.50 → 1563.40] I found out
[1563.40 → 1564.54] how much that RF chamber
[1564.54 → 1564.96] cost.
[1565.10 → 1565.64] You didn't know?
[1565.88 → 1566.78] I didn't.
[1566.88 → 1567.30] I did.
[1567.80 → 1568.70] I didn't.
[1571.72 → 1572.20] Yeah.
[1572.70 → 1573.18] So,
[1573.18 → 1573.96] It's a cool room.
[1574.24 → 1574.58] Yeah.
[1574.74 → 1575.54] It's a pretty cool room.
[1575.68 → 1575.90] Yeah.
[1575.96 → 1577.24] I thought it was six figures.
[1577.38 → 1578.10] I didn't think it was
[1578.10 → 1579.32] deep six figures.
[1579.48 → 1579.70] Yeah.
[1580.42 → 1580.76] Yeah.
[1581.06 → 1581.28] Yeah.
[1581.28 → 1581.60] Yeah.
[1581.70 → 1582.02] But,
[1582.16 → 1582.52] but,
[1583.20 → 1583.64] I have to,
[1583.78 → 1584.56] I have to shout out
[1584.56 → 1585.40] Raymond DMC.
[1586.08 → 1586.56] Apparently,
[1586.88 → 1587.26] we're,
[1587.32 → 1588.40] we're doing some,
[1588.52 → 1589.52] some cross promotional,
[1590.02 → 1590.30] like,
[1590.36 → 1591.22] we're doing some marketing
[1591.22 → 1591.82] for them
[1591.82 → 1592.54] and it's,
[1592.64 → 1593.22] it's
[1593.22 → 1594.76] not
[1594.76 → 1596.20] costing a lot
[1596.20 → 1596.96] or something.
[1597.10 → 1597.56] I don't know
[1597.56 → 1598.44] the exact deal.
[1598.44 → 1599.98] but we have a video
[1599.98 → 1601.44] coming on our RF chamber
[1601.44 → 1601.84] soon
[1601.84 → 1603.68] and it's
[1603.68 → 1604.98] freaking sick.
[1605.10 → 1606.00] It's very cool.
[1606.16 → 1606.34] Yeah.
[1606.42 → 1607.68] It's genuinely very cool.
[1608.06 → 1608.54] Like,
[1608.68 → 1609.68] really amazing.
[1609.90 → 1611.16] Really excited about that.
[1611.56 → 1612.02] So,
[1612.08 → 1612.82] there's the RF chamber,
[1613.00 → 1614.02] there's power supplies,
[1614.56 → 1615.02] man,
[1615.10 → 1615.84] GPU testing
[1615.84 → 1616.88] is going to be amazing
[1616.88 → 1617.94] with some of the changes
[1617.94 → 1618.60] to Mark bench.
[1619.44 → 1619.78] We,
[1619.96 → 1621.48] we were already,
[1622.52 → 1623.78] we were already running
[1623.78 → 1624.34] new,
[1624.60 → 1625.26] fresh benchmarks
[1625.26 → 1626.92] for every review
[1626.92 → 1628.74] and you guys are going
[1628.74 → 1630.12] to continue to see that
[1630.12 → 1630.80] which I,
[1631.00 → 1631.98] I'm not sure
[1631.98 → 1632.78] who else
[1632.78 → 1633.88] is actually doing that
[1633.88 → 1634.20] right now
[1634.20 → 1635.14] because it's extremely
[1635.14 → 1635.94] time-consuming
[1635.94 → 1637.34] and with the kind of crunch
[1637.34 → 1638.30] that you're operating on
[1638.30 → 1639.40] for these GPU reviews,
[1639.54 → 1640.18] it's really,
[1640.34 → 1641.12] really tough to do
[1641.12 → 1643.24] but we are going to be
[1643.24 → 1644.70] doing even more testing.
[1647.24 → 1647.72] Yeah,
[1647.76 → 1648.34] I was trying to think,
[1648.34 → 1649.22] like what else is,
[1649.30 → 1650.22] what else is kind of shaken?
[1650.40 → 1650.58] So,
[1651.76 → 1652.24] that's it.
[1652.80 → 1654.62] I am the chief vision officer,
[1655.40 → 1655.70] oh yeah,
[1655.76 → 1656.28] the moat building,
[1656.42 → 1656.60] right.
[1656.74 → 1657.06] So,
[1657.38 → 1658.60] when I say moat building,
[1658.80 → 1659.86] the goal is not
[1659.86 → 1660.66] to,
[1660.72 → 1662.02] to like aggressively,
[1662.38 → 1662.74] you know,
[1662.84 → 1664.38] attack other media outlets.
[1664.50 → 1665.48] That's why I referred to it
[1665.48 → 1666.12] as a moat
[1666.12 → 1667.96] and not as like a catapult.
[1667.98 → 1668.58] Defensive manoeuvre.
[1668.64 → 1669.28] Trebuchet, yeah.
[1669.40 → 1669.58] Like,
[1669.68 → 1671.16] the idea is just
[1671.16 → 1671.50] by,
[1671.62 → 1673.16] by elevating our content,
[1673.34 → 1674.42] by making things
[1674.42 → 1676.14] the best that we possibly can,
[1676.58 → 1677.76] we're putting ourselves
[1677.76 → 1678.38] in a position
[1678.38 → 1680.32] where other people
[1680.32 → 1681.14] are just going to have
[1681.14 → 1682.24] to make bigger investments
[1682.24 → 1683.42] if they want to match us
[1683.42 → 1683.90] for content.
[1684.38 → 1685.24] I had some people
[1685.24 → 1686.10] kind of criticize me
[1686.10 → 1686.56] for that,
[1687.04 → 1688.28] like moat building
[1688.28 → 1689.52] and I guess there is
[1689.52 → 1690.16] kind of negative
[1690.16 → 1691.04] connotation there
[1691.04 → 1692.84] but shouldn't everyone
[1692.84 → 1693.60] be trying to do
[1693.60 → 1695.24] the absolute best they can
[1695.24 → 1696.48] to make the best content
[1696.48 → 1697.32] they possibly can?
[1697.32 → 1697.94] I don't think that's
[1697.94 → 1698.60] the only approach
[1698.60 → 1699.26] either,
[1699.44 → 1699.98] to be honest,
[1700.10 → 1701.32] because we're doing
[1701.32 → 1702.66] like all the things
[1702.66 → 1703.30] under the sun
[1703.30 → 1705.38] and you could specialize.
[1707.28 → 1707.68] Yeah,
[1707.76 → 1708.24] that's not really,
[1708.36 → 1708.64] is that,
[1708.82 → 1710.16] yeah,
[1710.42 → 1711.22] is that really like,
[1711.72 → 1712.18] okay,
[1712.28 → 1712.52] sure.
[1712.98 → 1713.58] So what you're saying
[1713.58 → 1714.20] is like you would
[1714.20 → 1715.02] build your moat
[1715.02 → 1716.18] but like a small moat
[1716.18 → 1717.32] around a small castle
[1717.32 → 1718.62] by like conquering
[1718.62 → 1719.26] a niche kind of thing.
[1719.26 → 1719.28] Yeah,
[1719.28 → 1719.80] because you were mentioning
[1719.80 → 1720.06] like,
[1720.16 → 1720.26] oh,
[1720.30 → 1720.84] other people are going to
[1720.84 → 1721.62] have to up their investment.
[1721.74 → 1721.94] It's like,
[1722.00 → 1722.16] well,
[1722.28 → 1724.62] not in the same way though.
[1724.70 → 1724.92] Oh,
[1724.98 → 1725.22] sure.
[1725.28 → 1725.80] I see what you mean.
[1725.86 → 1726.02] Yeah,
[1726.02 → 1727.18] it could be in a smaller way
[1727.18 → 1728.20] around a smaller niche.
[1728.64 → 1729.04] Absolutely.
[1729.26 → 1729.40] I mean,
[1729.42 → 1730.08] I've talked about
[1730.08 → 1731.36] how I think in a big way
[1731.36 → 1732.56] that's the future
[1732.56 → 1733.24] of the platform
[1733.24 → 1735.82] is smaller niche
[1735.82 → 1737.00] specialist channels.
[1737.34 → 1739.86] So the way that my vision
[1739.86 → 1741.06] kind of looks right now
[1741.06 → 1742.58] is we're going to have
[1742.58 → 1743.48] to find a way
[1743.48 → 1744.88] to match that
[1744.88 → 1745.94] and I think the way
[1745.94 → 1746.60] to do that
[1746.60 → 1748.42] is by centralizing
[1748.42 → 1749.88] a lot of great testing
[1749.88 → 1751.08] with great testing equipment
[1751.08 → 1753.82] and really knowledgeable people
[1753.82 → 1755.10] generating data
[1755.10 → 1756.40] and then taking that
[1756.40 → 1757.66] and disseminating it
[1757.66 → 1759.86] across a wide variety
[1759.86 → 1760.76] of channels,
[1760.92 → 1761.94] be they written
[1761.94 → 1762.98] or video
[1762.98 → 1763.84] or podcast
[1763.84 → 1765.38] or whatever it is
[1765.38 → 1765.94] that they are.
[1766.58 → 1767.34] That's the way
[1767.34 → 1767.86] that we're going
[1767.86 → 1768.44] to be able
[1768.44 → 1770.28] to leverage our strength,
[1770.38 → 1771.34] which is our size,
[1771.48 → 1773.04] while also competing
[1773.04 → 1775.00] with scrappy,
[1775.48 → 1776.96] smaller operations.
[1778.04 → 1778.98] That's the vision,
[1779.24 → 1780.06] chief vision officer.
[1780.22 → 1780.88] Let's go.
[1781.28 → 1782.04] Want to pick our next topic?
[1782.04 → 1783.76] Are you tired
[1783.76 → 1784.88] of talking about it yet?
[1787.28 → 1788.36] Which part of it?
[1788.76 → 1790.48] Just any part of it?
[1790.58 → 1791.68] I feel like you've probably
[1791.68 → 1793.10] just had constant conversations
[1793.10 → 1793.94] since it was done.
[1794.86 → 1795.94] Sort of, actually.
[1796.34 → 1796.98] You know what?
[1797.18 → 1797.62] Internally,
[1797.70 → 1798.72] only a couple of people
[1798.72 → 1799.38] messaged me
[1799.38 → 1800.52] after Monday morning meeting.
[1801.26 → 1802.24] Even externally,
[1802.38 → 1803.52] I only had maybe like
[1803.52 → 1804.78] half a dozen people
[1804.78 → 1805.60] message me about it.
[1805.98 → 1806.54] The thing is that
[1806.54 → 1807.66] I'm kind of antisocial,
[1807.78 → 1808.42] so I don't really
[1808.42 → 1809.36] talk to people.
[1809.36 → 1813.82] I mean,
[1813.86 → 1814.50] I messaged Taken
[1814.50 → 1815.28] about it, obviously.
[1815.44 → 1815.76] He was like,
[1815.80 → 1816.78] hey, thanks for the heads-up.
[1817.04 → 1817.78] And I was like...
[1817.78 → 1817.94] Yeah.
[1819.16 → 1820.14] I had no idea
[1820.14 → 1820.62] it was coming.
[1820.88 → 1821.64] We pushed this like
[1821.64 → 1822.98] massive float plane update
[1822.98 → 1823.56] and then it was like,
[1823.62 → 1823.86] well,
[1824.04 → 1825.92] happy it works.
[1827.70 → 1828.06] Yeah,
[1828.12 → 1829.48] what did he say?
[1829.66 → 1830.84] I forget what he
[1830.84 → 1831.88] actually said about it.
[1833.06 → 1833.42] Yeah,
[1833.50 → 1834.28] thanks for the heads-up.
[1834.32 → 1834.52] I go,
[1834.62 → 1834.84] ha ha,
[1834.92 → 1835.46] no problem.
[1835.46 → 1836.00] He goes,
[1836.08 → 1836.46] ha ha.
[1836.46 → 1840.82] I have random people
[1840.82 → 1841.58] I don't know
[1841.58 → 1842.70] messaging me already.
[1842.92 → 1843.32] Dude,
[1843.42 → 1844.60] Reddit was covered
[1844.60 → 1845.42] in his face
[1845.42 → 1846.16] because people
[1846.16 → 1846.92] were just making memes
[1846.92 → 1847.70] about it and stuff.
[1848.98 → 1849.42] Generally,
[1849.62 → 1849.80] like,
[1850.16 → 1850.54] good-hearted,
[1850.70 → 1851.00] I think.
[1851.28 → 1851.36] So,
[1851.56 → 1852.00] it was good.
[1852.16 → 1852.34] Yeah,
[1852.40 → 1852.68] it's good.
[1852.72 → 1853.02] Overall,
[1853.24 → 1854.84] I've been really happy
[1854.84 → 1855.66] with the support
[1855.66 → 1856.28] from the community.
[1856.54 → 1857.14] Thank you so much,
[1857.22 → 1857.48] guys.
[1857.62 → 1858.96] I really do agree
[1858.96 → 1860.34] with most of the community
[1860.34 → 1861.24] that says they think
[1861.24 → 1861.78] this is going to be
[1861.78 → 1862.56] a positive change.
[1862.94 → 1863.58] I do too.
[1863.72 → 1864.06] I just,
[1864.70 → 1865.10] oh man,
[1865.10 → 1866.26] what was some stupid
[1866.26 → 1867.36] administrative thing
[1867.36 → 1867.96] that I had to deal
[1867.96 → 1868.44] with this week?
[1868.48 → 1868.62] You know,
[1868.66 → 1869.26] it doesn't matter.
[1869.32 → 1869.70] I think it's going
[1869.70 → 1870.50] to be hard to say
[1870.50 → 1871.50] without saying
[1871.50 → 1872.38] anything identifiable.
[1873.96 → 1875.02] It doesn't matter.
[1875.58 → 1876.74] Every time someone
[1876.74 → 1877.98] contacts me at this point
[1877.98 → 1878.70] about something
[1878.70 → 1880.60] that is not going
[1880.60 → 1881.22] to be my problem
[1881.22 → 1882.26] in two weeks,
[1882.42 → 1883.18] I'm just like,
[1883.66 → 1883.94] yeah.
[1884.86 → 1885.48] Two weeks,
[1885.60 → 1885.88] dang it,
[1885.94 → 1886.42] six weeks.
[1887.90 → 1889.04] I'm checked out already.
[1889.26 → 1890.10] I just ask him
[1890.10 → 1890.50] every time,
[1890.58 → 1891.56] can this wait six weeks?
[1893.50 → 1894.16] Does this have
[1894.16 → 1894.78] to be dealt with now?
[1894.82 → 1895.24] I don't even have
[1895.24 → 1895.66] to do that.
[1895.74 → 1896.34] I can just ask him
[1896.34 → 1897.10] to wait two weeks
[1897.10 → 1898.70] and then do that again
[1898.70 → 1899.56] and then one more time.
[1900.52 → 1901.70] That's the vision officer,
[1901.84 → 1902.00] dude.
[1902.14 → 1902.34] Yeah,
[1902.38 → 1903.02] that's how I deal
[1903.02 → 1903.80] with family members
[1903.80 → 1904.52] that I don't want
[1904.52 → 1905.46] to see very often.
[1905.60 → 1906.40] Just delay repeatedly?
[1906.56 → 1906.74] Yeah,
[1906.80 → 1906.96] yeah.
[1907.02 → 1907.68] So what you do,
[1907.92 → 1908.70] what the key is.
[1908.70 → 1909.16] Is that what's happening
[1909.16 → 1910.10] with the workout day then?
[1910.22 → 1910.42] You,
[1910.64 → 1911.04] no.
[1911.50 → 1912.02] I'm kidding.
[1912.18 → 1912.50] No,
[1912.56 → 1913.02] actually,
[1913.18 → 1913.82] that's a whole,
[1913.92 → 1914.66] that's a whole thing.
[1914.82 → 1915.00] So,
[1915.36 → 1915.82] so,
[1915.98 → 1916.74] so the trick,
[1916.92 → 1917.48] the trick
[1917.48 → 1918.96] is that you,
[1919.16 → 1922.42] you schedule something
[1922.42 → 1924.14] really far out
[1924.14 → 1925.48] and then,
[1925.58 → 1926.80] but not so far out
[1926.80 → 1927.32] that they'll try
[1927.32 → 1928.06] to schedule something
[1928.06 → 1928.66] in between,
[1928.86 → 1930.22] but far out enough
[1930.22 → 1930.92] that,
[1931.34 → 1931.58] okay,
[1931.64 → 1932.22] so first you wait
[1932.22 → 1933.10] as long as possible.
[1933.52 → 1933.92] Right.
[1934.00 → 1934.30] Then,
[1934.40 → 1935.48] when it's finally time
[1935.48 → 1936.22] to do something,
[1936.42 → 1937.30] you schedule it
[1937.30 → 1938.08] for as far out
[1938.08 → 1938.70] as you can
[1938.70 → 1939.26] where there won't
[1939.26 → 1939.80] really be room
[1939.80 → 1940.28] to do something
[1940.28 → 1940.78] in between
[1940.78 → 1941.98] and then you won't
[1941.98 → 1942.68] have to hear about it
[1942.68 → 1943.34] until then.
[1943.66 → 1944.42] Then you rinse
[1944.42 → 1944.90] and repeat
[1944.90 → 1945.38] and that's how
[1945.38 → 1946.08] you can kind of
[1946.08 → 1947.26] get down from like
[1947.26 → 1949.80] monthly to realistically
[1949.80 → 1950.80] special occasions
[1950.80 → 1951.56] and like a couple
[1951.56 → 1952.30] of other times a year.
[1952.62 → 1953.02] That's,
[1953.02 → 1954.28] that's the trick.
[1955.24 → 1955.88] That's the
[1955.88 → 1956.60] that's the start.
[1956.76 → 1957.30] That's the start.
[1958.24 → 1958.64] Yeah.
[1959.52 → 1959.96] Okay.
[1960.06 → 1960.32] What do you want
[1960.32 → 1961.04] to talk about now?
[1961.24 → 1961.46] Uh,
[1961.46 → 1962.30] we can talk about the TV.
[1962.54 → 1964.26] Let's talk about the TV.
[1964.82 → 1965.66] Startup offers
[1965.66 → 1966.84] a free TV.
[1966.96 → 1967.48] Free TV.
[1967.64 → 1968.12] Free TV.
[1968.30 → 1968.66] Free TV.
[1969.24 → 1970.02] It spies on you.
[1970.48 → 1970.80] Uh,
[1970.80 → 1971.32] it's a startup
[1971.32 → 1971.98] called Tell
[1971.98 → 1972.82] and it will soon
[1972.82 → 1973.38] be offering
[1973.38 → 1974.58] a free 55 inch
[1974.58 → 1976.18] 4K HDR television
[1976.18 → 1977.14] that comes with
[1977.14 → 1979.28] a second banner screen,
[1979.42 → 1980.14] which is just like
[1980.14 → 1982.30] a very ultra-wide screen,
[1982.30 → 1983.04] uh,
[1983.04 → 1984.20] that goes underneath
[1984.20 → 1985.14] that constantly
[1985.14 → 1986.46] plays ads.
[1987.12 → 1988.94] The ads are designed
[1988.94 → 1989.88] to not interrupt
[1989.88 → 1990.48] the television
[1990.48 → 1991.24] viewing experience,
[1991.60 → 1992.70] but just in case
[1992.70 → 1993.30] you were concerned
[1993.30 → 1993.68] about it,
[1993.92 → 1995.04] the 55-inch screen
[1995.04 → 1996.50] above can also
[1996.50 → 1997.74] just play ads
[1997.74 → 1998.96] when it's not in use
[1998.96 → 1999.90] just to make sure
[1999.90 → 2001.12] that you're fully saturated.
[2001.48 → 2001.86] Uh,
[2001.90 → 2003.54] the built-in sound bar
[2003.54 → 2004.70] includes a microphone
[2004.70 → 2005.86] and motion tracking
[2005.86 → 2007.38] camera with privacy
[2007.38 → 2007.86] shutter.
[2008.12 → 2009.12] According to Tell's
[2009.12 → 2010.66] published policies,
[2011.06 → 2012.38] the TV may collect
[2012.38 → 2013.20] information about
[2013.20 → 2014.28] the audio and video
[2014.28 → 2015.18] content you watch,
[2015.50 → 2016.16] search queries,
[2016.48 → 2017.56] the physical presence
[2017.56 → 2018.50] of anyone in the room,
[2018.66 → 2019.58] and it may collect
[2019.58 → 2020.04] names,
[2020.26 → 2020.92] email addresses,
[2021.28 → 2022.02] phone numbers,
[2022.30 → 2022.60] ages,
[2023.02 → 2023.98] dates of birth,
[2024.28 → 2026.10] same sort of thing,
[2026.32 → 2026.54] uh,
[2026.62 → 2027.18] zip codes,
[2027.46 → 2028.76] precise geolocation,
[2029.22 → 2029.52] gender,
[2029.86 → 2030.26] ethnicity,
[2030.76 → 2032.00] and sexual life
[2032.00 → 2033.28] or sexual orientation.
[2033.28 → 2035.28] and also political
[2035.28 → 2036.98] beliefs like environmentalism,
[2037.04 → 2037.80] which you don't have
[2037.80 → 2038.58] if you own this TV.
[2039.12 → 2040.10] If users opt out
[2040.10 → 2041.08] of data collection,
[2041.26 → 2042.28] they will have to
[2042.28 → 2043.30] return the television
[2043.30 → 2044.26] or have their credit
[2044.26 → 2046.32] card charged $500.
[2047.08 → 2047.50] Nice.
[2047.66 → 2048.60] The company claims
[2048.60 → 2049.24] they will ship
[2049.24 → 2050.14] half a million,
[2050.34 → 2052.06] half a million units,
[2052.06 → 2052.66] uh,
[2052.66 → 2053.68] starting this summer.
[2055.44 → 2055.92] Wow.
[2056.72 → 2058.20] I think we should get one.
[2058.70 → 2059.06] Oh,
[2059.30 → 2059.56] yeah.
[2059.68 → 2060.68] As soon as I saw this,
[2060.72 → 2061.16] I was like,
[2061.22 → 2062.48] I am all over this.
[2062.68 → 2063.24] Because we have to try
[2063.24 → 2064.10] to figure out how to
[2064.10 → 2065.08] spoof it.
[2065.68 → 2066.60] That's my opinion.
[2066.74 → 2067.50] That would be sick.
[2067.60 → 2068.20] We should try to fit,
[2068.28 → 2068.38] like,
[2068.42 → 2069.52] the motion presence thing,
[2069.58 → 2069.78] or just,
[2069.88 → 2069.94] like,
[2069.98 → 2070.82] set up some stuff,
[2070.90 → 2071.02] like,
[2071.06 → 2071.56] make it think
[2071.56 → 2072.58] that things are going on.
[2073.58 → 2074.62] So we just need,
[2074.62 → 2074.86] like,
[2074.90 → 2075.62] one of those little
[2075.62 → 2077.50] humping dog USB things
[2077.50 → 2079.38] so that it thinks
[2079.38 → 2080.62] it's monitoring your sex life
[2080.62 → 2081.00] or whatever.
[2081.10 → 2082.20] It just goes continuously.
[2084.02 → 2084.42] Oh,
[2084.42 → 2084.78] man.
[2085.46 → 2086.04] I don't know.
[2086.88 → 2088.04] Holy crap.
[2088.20 → 2088.34] Like,
[2088.40 → 2088.90] if you could,
[2089.34 → 2091.08] if you could somehow have it
[2091.08 → 2091.24] so,
[2091.38 → 2091.44] like,
[2091.48 → 2092.36] the main screen
[2092.36 → 2095.60] was viewable by you,
[2095.68 → 2096.88] but that second screen
[2096.88 → 2097.12] was,
[2097.30 → 2097.36] like,
[2097.44 → 2098.78] turned around or something,
[2099.00 → 2100.18] but there was stuff there
[2100.18 → 2101.34] to trick it into thinking
[2101.34 → 2102.50] that it was tracking things.
[2102.56 → 2102.84] Okay.
[2103.36 → 2104.34] Mr. Cafetière.
[2104.62 → 2104.82] Oh,
[2104.86 → 2105.02] my.
[2106.38 → 2107.04] You know it's serious
[2107.04 → 2108.12] when he pulls out the last name.
[2108.64 → 2108.96] I'm,
[2109.00 → 2109.44] I'm sorry.
[2109.52 → 2110.18] I've got to say,
[2110.34 → 2111.40] I actually don't think
[2111.40 → 2112.04] this is a big deal.
[2113.00 → 2113.36] Really?
[2114.28 → 2114.54] Well.
[2114.54 → 2114.68] Because it's,
[2114.82 → 2114.86] like,
[2114.88 → 2115.72] all already happening?
[2116.06 → 2116.32] Well.
[2116.98 → 2117.14] Oh,
[2117.52 → 2117.94] really?
[2117.94 → 2118.22] You just,
[2118.62 → 2120.76] you can't let me build there?
[2122.36 → 2123.18] Think about it.
[2123.58 → 2124.84] We've seen recently
[2124.84 → 2125.64] all the stuff
[2125.64 → 2126.44] that's been coming out
[2126.44 → 2127.74] about Tesla employees
[2127.74 → 2129.00] having access to
[2129.00 → 2129.76] footage collected
[2129.76 → 2130.50] from the cars,
[2130.72 → 2131.08] including,
[2131.08 → 2131.60] like,
[2131.98 → 2132.30] you know,
[2132.56 → 2133.38] people performing
[2133.38 → 2134.24] sex acts.
[2134.78 → 2135.36] You know,
[2135.38 → 2136.64] we've seen the way that,
[2136.78 → 2136.98] I mean,
[2137.34 → 2138.04] honestly,
[2138.34 → 2139.48] I would say
[2139.48 → 2140.02] that
[2140.02 → 2142.76] my digital communication
[2142.76 → 2143.62] through email
[2143.62 → 2144.70] is probably
[2144.70 → 2145.66] more intimate
[2145.66 → 2147.46] than a camera
[2147.46 → 2148.16] in my living room.
[2148.96 → 2149.48] Honestly.
[2151.48 → 2152.62] Would you disagree?
[2153.00 → 2153.20] No,
[2153.24 → 2153.90] I could see that.
[2154.16 → 2154.66] And,
[2154.80 → 2156.10] I'm not even
[2156.10 → 2157.02] the kind of person
[2157.02 → 2157.96] who just
[2157.96 → 2159.28] posts everything
[2159.28 → 2160.40] about my personal life
[2160.40 → 2160.96] to Facebook.
[2160.96 → 2161.08] Facebook.
[2161.64 → 2162.54] For someone
[2162.54 → 2163.48] who already
[2163.48 → 2164.10] posts
[2164.10 → 2165.26] every thought
[2165.26 → 2165.78] that enters
[2165.78 → 2166.42] their mind
[2166.42 → 2167.24] on Facebook
[2167.24 → 2167.78] or Twitter?
[2168.12 → 2168.64] It's not true
[2168.64 → 2169.18] for everyone,
[2169.30 → 2169.42] though.
[2169.48 → 2169.70] No,
[2169.88 → 2171.30] but for those people,
[2171.38 → 2172.36] realistically,
[2173.02 → 2174.78] what fucking difference
[2174.78 → 2175.62] does a TV
[2175.62 → 2176.38] in their living room
[2176.38 → 2176.98] with a camera
[2176.98 → 2177.54] on it make?
[2178.86 → 2179.38] Honestly.
[2179.38 → 2181.36] I think the main thing,
[2181.80 → 2182.82] I think the main difference
[2182.82 → 2183.64] personally would be
[2183.64 → 2184.34] that this one,
[2184.46 → 2185.06] the point
[2185.06 → 2186.64] and what you are
[2186.64 → 2187.54] agreeing to
[2187.54 → 2188.92] is the
[2188.92 → 2190.50] capture of that data,
[2190.68 → 2191.30] whereas like
[2191.30 → 2192.22] the Tesla thing,
[2192.82 → 2194.42] people are going
[2194.42 → 2195.12] to get $4
[2195.12 → 2196.28] in a class action
[2196.28 → 2197.30] lawsuit because of it.
[2197.40 → 2197.96] That's huge.
[2199.30 → 2199.76] I mean,
[2199.88 → 2200.18] yeah,
[2200.22 → 2200.60] I guess.
[2200.74 → 2201.80] I just mean
[2201.80 → 2202.98] this isn't new.
[2203.62 → 2204.02] Look at how,
[2204.12 → 2204.30] okay,
[2204.44 → 2205.62] look at the difference
[2205.62 → 2206.30] in cost
[2206.30 → 2207.42] between the
[2207.42 → 2208.94] ad-supported version
[2208.94 → 2209.84] of the Facebook
[2209.84 → 2211.00] or the meta,
[2211.20 → 2211.72] I don't know,
[2211.78 → 2211.96] whatever,
[2212.04 → 2212.46] the Quest,
[2212.96 → 2213.48] the difference
[2213.48 → 2214.84] between the personal version
[2214.84 → 2215.54] and the business version,
[2215.58 → 2215.86] it was what,
[2215.90 → 2216.28] like $200,
[2216.40 → 2217.66] $300 or something like that?
[2217.68 → 2217.86] I remember,
[2217.94 → 2218.42] but it's a lot.
[2218.42 → 2220.16] But that was the first time
[2220.16 → 2221.16] that I had ever had
[2221.16 → 2222.82] an apples-to-apples comparison
[2222.82 → 2225.06] of the same service
[2225.06 → 2227.64] in the personal information
[2227.64 → 2228.52] supported version
[2228.52 → 2229.26] and the
[2229.56 → 2229.64] hey,
[2229.68 → 2230.62] we actually need to make
[2230.62 → 2231.62] some money on this version.
[2231.72 → 2232.64] I shouldn't say the first.
[2232.94 → 2234.34] When I signed up for G Suite,
[2234.80 → 2235.94] in the early days,
[2236.00 → 2236.92] it was pretty inexpensive,
[2237.16 → 2237.70] but nowadays,
[2238.28 → 2238.90] services like
[2238.90 → 2239.38] G Suite
[2239.38 → 2240.34] are not actually,
[2240.38 → 2241.22] or Google Workspace
[2241.22 → 2242.10] or whatever they call it now,
[2242.24 → 2243.62] are not actually that cheap.
[2243.88 → 2246.28] I have easily spent $500
[2246.28 → 2247.86] on my email account
[2247.86 → 2248.60] in the years
[2248.60 → 2249.52] that I've been operating it.
[2249.88 → 2250.24] You,
[2250.46 → 2251.62] the free Gmail user,
[2251.80 → 2252.56] have spent nothing.
[2252.84 → 2253.28] Why?
[2253.92 → 2254.58] Because Google
[2254.58 → 2255.62] has gotten $500
[2255.62 → 2256.84] of value from you.
[2256.98 → 2257.28] That's,
[2257.34 → 2258.50] that's math.
[2258.64 → 2259.68] That's how that works,
[2259.74 → 2259.96] right?
[2260.30 → 2261.18] And so if these guys
[2261.18 → 2261.62] are saying,
[2262.00 → 2262.14] yeah,
[2262.18 → 2262.76] this is like
[2262.76 → 2265.12] a basic tier $500 TV,
[2265.48 → 2266.14] which we know
[2266.14 → 2268.16] because we're really smart
[2268.16 → 2268.80] and,
[2268.96 → 2269.90] you can just buy it
[2269.90 → 2270.38] for $500.
[2270.38 → 2271.66] 55 inch does not make it
[2271.66 → 2272.74] a theatre display.
[2272.96 → 2274.22] It's 55 inches,
[2274.26 → 2275.66] which is pretty decent size,
[2275.76 → 2277.18] but they charge you $500
[2277.18 → 2278.28] if you don't agree
[2278.28 → 2279.38] to the policy anymore,
[2279.54 → 2280.06] right?
[2280.62 → 2281.14] $500?
[2281.58 → 2281.90] Yeah.
[2282.38 → 2282.86] Yeah.
[2282.86 → 2285.56] A constant recording
[2285.56 → 2286.42] of your living room
[2286.42 → 2287.82] is probably worth that,
[2287.82 → 2289.06] and you've probably
[2289.06 → 2290.68] already traded your soul
[2290.68 → 2291.70] for that amount
[2291.70 → 2292.48] of money before.
[2293.42 → 2293.94] So,
[2294.16 → 2295.18] I'm not saying
[2295.18 → 2296.36] you should do it.
[2296.46 → 2297.18] I'm just saying
[2297.18 → 2298.48] you're doing it already.
[2298.76 → 2298.86] Yeah.
[2299.18 → 2299.42] Yeah,
[2299.44 → 2299.56] yeah,
[2299.56 → 2299.72] yeah.
[2299.78 → 2300.96] I think that's fair enough.
[2301.22 → 2302.24] I do think there's,
[2302.30 → 2303.78] there are easier steps
[2303.78 → 2304.70] one can take
[2304.70 → 2306.06] to reduce this amount
[2306.06 → 2306.56] of stuff.
[2306.72 → 2307.00] Sure.
[2307.16 → 2308.24] If they don't,
[2308.24 → 2308.52] yeah,
[2308.62 → 2309.78] do something like this.
[2310.28 → 2310.54] Yeah.
[2310.68 → 2311.88] Especially if you're not
[2311.88 → 2313.86] like a social media person.
[2314.06 → 2314.16] Yeah.
[2314.18 → 2314.44] Which,
[2314.60 → 2315.44] if you're not doing it
[2315.44 → 2316.02] for your job,
[2316.06 → 2316.62] I would kind of
[2316.62 → 2317.58] pretty highly suggest
[2317.58 → 2318.68] you probably do less
[2318.68 → 2319.26] than you are
[2319.26 → 2320.68] because it just
[2320.68 → 2321.36] rots your brain.
[2322.06 → 2322.84] But like,
[2324.16 → 2325.10] yeah,
[2325.48 → 2326.16] I don't know.
[2326.56 → 2326.90] I,
[2327.70 → 2328.28] when they said
[2328.28 → 2328.80] their stat,
[2328.88 → 2329.20] I don't remember
[2329.20 → 2329.84] where it was.
[2330.08 → 2330.28] Oh yeah,
[2330.30 → 2330.94] the company claims
[2330.94 → 2331.32] they will ship
[2331.32 → 2332.26] half a million units
[2332.26 → 2333.04] starting this summer.
[2335.76 → 2336.16] Yeah,
[2336.28 → 2336.64] probably,
[2337.04 → 2337.60] maybe more.
[2338.32 → 2339.30] I suspect people
[2339.30 → 2340.80] will jump on this
[2340.80 → 2341.20] for sure.
[2341.36 → 2341.64] Oh yeah.
[2342.00 → 2342.54] We've got,
[2342.66 → 2343.20] we've got people
[2343.20 → 2343.84] in the chat like,
[2344.16 → 2344.74] dude whose face
[2344.74 → 2345.24] is in public
[2345.24 → 2346.00] doesn't see how
[2346.00 → 2346.70] being in someone's
[2346.70 → 2347.24] image database
[2347.24 → 2347.76] might not be
[2347.76 → 2348.22] someone else's
[2348.22 → 2348.64] cup of tea.
[2348.64 → 2349.58] Of course I do.
[2349.90 → 2351.06] That's not my point
[2351.06 → 2352.06] at all.
[2352.38 → 2352.84] He's saying
[2352.84 → 2354.10] a very large
[2354.10 → 2355.02] percentage of users
[2355.02 → 2356.36] are doing that
[2356.36 → 2356.96] stuff anyway.
[2357.32 → 2357.88] So if you're
[2357.88 → 2358.76] security conscious,
[2359.62 → 2360.60] obviously this is
[2360.60 → 2361.16] not for you.
[2361.30 → 2362.28] Very obviously.
[2362.38 → 2362.80] But you already
[2362.80 → 2363.32] knew that.
[2364.36 → 2364.80] So like,
[2365.98 → 2366.90] yeah,
[2367.10 → 2367.56] I don't know.
[2368.02 → 2368.46] There's a
[2368.48 → 2369.04] there's a ton
[2369.04 → 2369.54] of people
[2369.54 → 2370.98] that like put
[2370.98 → 2372.78] way too much
[2372.78 → 2373.66] information out there.
[2374.06 → 2374.34] Yeah,
[2374.52 → 2375.04] absolutely.
[2375.22 → 2375.54] Like those,
[2375.62 → 2376.50] those Facebook quizzes
[2376.50 → 2377.40] that like ask you
[2377.40 → 2378.46] every weird
[2378.46 → 2379.36] personal detail
[2379.36 → 2379.94] you could ever
[2379.94 → 2381.02] have as a secret
[2381.02 → 2381.60] question answer
[2381.60 → 2382.06] because they're
[2382.06 → 2382.62] farming secret
[2382.62 → 2383.24] question answers.
[2383.46 → 2384.42] People fill those
[2384.42 → 2385.72] out all the time.
[2386.26 → 2386.42] Yep.
[2386.48 → 2387.12] And this is,
[2387.24 → 2388.72] this one feels
[2388.72 → 2389.98] really invasive
[2389.98 → 2390.80] and egregious,
[2390.92 → 2392.56] but I'm willing
[2392.56 → 2393.50] to bet there was a
[2393.62 → 2394.04] okay,
[2394.24 → 2395.36] and this may,
[2395.46 → 2395.60] okay,
[2395.64 → 2396.52] this actually may
[2396.52 → 2397.08] not be true,
[2397.18 → 2398.18] but I wouldn't be
[2398.18 → 2399.20] surprised if we saw
[2399.20 → 2400.08] a similar reaction
[2400.08 → 2401.22] to the first billboard
[2401.22 → 2401.74] on the highway.
[2402.38 → 2402.78] Like,
[2402.78 → 2403.02] oh,
[2403.06 → 2403.76] it's distracting.
[2403.96 → 2404.74] It's an eyesore.
[2405.14 → 2405.54] Or,
[2405.74 → 2405.96] you know,
[2406.02 → 2407.34] the first full page.
[2407.36 → 2408.28] I still hate billboards.
[2408.40 → 2409.32] Or the first full page
[2409.32 → 2410.24] advertising spread
[2410.24 → 2410.94] in a newspaper.
[2411.70 → 2411.82] What?
[2411.90 → 2412.60] This isn't even,
[2412.72 → 2414.02] this isn't even content.
[2414.22 → 2415.28] This is just ads.
[2415.74 → 2416.82] I paid for this newspaper.
[2416.86 → 2417.42] I paid for this.
[2418.22 → 2418.66] Exactly.
[2418.92 → 2419.36] Exactly.
[2419.36 → 2419.72] This,
[2419.72 → 2421.82] this slow boil
[2421.82 → 2423.32] has been happening
[2423.32 → 2424.88] for over a century
[2424.88 → 2425.60] at this point.
[2427.16 → 2429.00] And what's next?
[2429.62 → 2430.60] I guess that's where
[2430.60 → 2431.56] I'm going with this,
[2431.86 → 2432.10] right?
[2432.16 → 2432.64] Like I'm,
[2432.64 → 2433.76] it's not that I'm not
[2433.76 → 2434.64] outraged.
[2434.98 → 2435.58] I'm just,
[2435.74 → 2436.78] I'm just saying like,
[2437.18 → 2438.26] this feels like a logical step.
[2438.32 → 2439.40] We've literally talked about
[2439.40 → 2440.46] how TVs are going to do this
[2440.46 → 2441.32] eventually on the WAN show
[2441.32 → 2441.80] in the past.
[2441.94 → 2442.10] Yeah.
[2442.22 → 2442.96] On that end,
[2443.00 → 2443.16] I mean,
[2443.16 → 2444.26] I think there's already,
[2444.26 → 2444.62] like,
[2444.74 → 2445.66] I think there's already
[2445.66 → 2446.76] patented technology
[2446.76 → 2447.46] that someone,
[2447.76 → 2448.32] that we talked about
[2448.32 → 2449.38] on WAN show from someone
[2449.38 → 2451.48] that monitors your eyes,
[2451.58 → 2452.42] that uses eye tracking
[2452.42 → 2453.26] to tell if you're actually
[2453.26 → 2454.28] looking at ads or not,
[2454.32 → 2454.48] right?
[2454.52 → 2455.06] Like that's,
[2456.70 → 2459.42] this is a logical step
[2459.42 → 2459.76] from there.
[2459.80 → 2459.98] I mean,
[2460.08 → 2461.42] I didn't think it was going
[2461.42 → 2462.02] to just have
[2462.02 → 2462.78] like a full,
[2463.18 → 2464.62] full motion camera
[2464.62 → 2465.64] necessarily.
[2465.64 → 2466.20] I thought,
[2466.20 → 2467.56] I thought eye tracking
[2467.56 → 2468.42] would be enough,
[2468.56 → 2469.74] but at every stage
[2469.74 → 2471.24] we just kind of get used to,
[2471.46 → 2471.86] yeah,
[2472.00 → 2472.30] all right,
[2472.38 → 2472.72] this seems,
[2472.94 → 2473.86] this seems normal now.
[2473.98 → 2474.24] So,
[2474.34 → 2474.74] so sorry,
[2474.82 → 2474.92] no,
[2474.96 → 2475.06] no,
[2475.10 → 2476.36] I actually want an answer
[2476.36 → 2476.66] to that.
[2476.70 → 2477.64] I want to hear from you guys.
[2477.68 → 2477.82] Okay,
[2477.88 → 2478.50] float plane chat.
[2479.18 → 2480.66] What's next?
[2480.90 → 2482.18] What's the next one?
[2482.18 → 2485.62] Is it now in your,
[2485.62 → 2487.52] in your bedroom?
[2487.66 → 2487.86] I mean,
[2487.94 → 2488.46] well then again,
[2488.64 → 2488.90] you know,
[2488.90 → 2489.94] you already look at like
[2489.94 → 2490.60] echo dots,
[2490.72 → 2490.86] right?
[2490.90 → 2491.40] They're everywhere.
[2491.78 → 2492.78] The number of people
[2492.78 → 2493.64] that probably have an echo
[2493.64 → 2494.50] dot in their bedroom
[2494.50 → 2495.34] right now.
[2495.46 → 2496.24] Ring doorbells.
[2496.34 → 2496.62] Yeah.
[2496.90 → 2497.30] Yeah.
[2497.66 → 2498.50] Stuff like that.
[2498.84 → 2499.24] Uh,
[2499.32 → 2499.54] okay.
[2499.66 → 2499.82] Well,
[2499.92 → 2500.46] okay.
[2500.52 → 2500.86] But we'll,
[2500.92 → 2501.32] do we see,
[2501.40 → 2501.54] okay.
[2501.54 → 2502.22] Then do we see an
[2502.22 → 2503.48] advertising supported
[2503.48 → 2504.64] version of the ring doorbell?
[2505.28 → 2506.78] Every time you come home,
[2506.78 → 2507.78] it's like a watch
[2507.78 → 2508.52] a 30-second ad
[2508.52 → 2509.56] before it lets you inside.
[2509.64 → 2510.42] courtesy of,
[2510.42 → 2510.78] you know,
[2511.00 → 2511.32] Moors.
[2511.46 → 2512.02] Well made,
[2512.12 → 2512.54] well priced,
[2512.64 → 2513.08] well-dressed.
[2513.20 → 2513.94] Like a freaking,
[2514.08 → 2514.78] I don't know.
[2515.06 → 2515.86] I noticed your,
[2515.96 → 2517.36] your outfit is looking
[2517.36 → 2518.50] rather tattered today.
[2518.86 → 2519.22] Yeah.
[2519.34 → 2520.22] You should check out
[2520.22 → 2520.92] Moors.
[2520.98 → 2521.70] Have you considered
[2521.70 → 2522.58] getting a haircut?
[2523.10 → 2523.28] You know,
[2523.36 → 2524.46] Great Clips down the street
[2524.46 → 2525.76] is running a promo right now.
[2526.54 → 2526.96] We,
[2527.06 → 2527.68] we noticed,
[2527.80 → 2528.08] uh,
[2528.08 → 2529.20] that you didn't take a lunch
[2529.20 → 2529.74] this morning.
[2529.84 → 2530.68] Would you like me to order
[2530.68 → 2531.50] some food for you?
[2531.84 → 2532.06] Like,
[2532.10 → 2532.82] honestly though,
[2532.94 → 2534.64] like that was supposed to be
[2534.64 → 2536.16] how digital assistants,
[2536.16 → 2536.58] like,
[2536.58 → 2537.50] Alexa and,
[2537.68 → 2538.64] and Siri,
[2538.78 → 2539.64] I guess to a lesser degree.
[2539.72 → 2540.06] I don't know what,
[2540.16 → 2541.06] what Apple was trying to do
[2541.06 → 2541.38] with Siri,
[2541.48 → 2542.66] but how Alexa
[2542.66 → 2544.18] and how Google Assistant
[2544.18 → 2546.18] and how to a lesser degree,
[2546.32 → 2547.86] but certainly significant degree,
[2547.94 → 2548.34] Cortana,
[2548.50 → 2549.80] that was supposed to be
[2549.80 → 2550.74] the whole point of them.
[2551.00 → 2552.74] They were supposed to make revenue
[2552.74 → 2553.60] through advertising.
[2553.76 → 2555.02] We were supposed to shop
[2555.02 → 2556.40] by just telling Alexa,
[2556.60 → 2556.74] Hey,
[2557.02 → 2557.28] uh,
[2557.28 → 2558.26] I'm out of Tide Pods.
[2558.28 → 2559.06] My kids ate them.
[2559.18 → 2560.12] Can you order some more?
[2560.12 → 2561.12] But maybe in the ones
[2561.12 → 2562.84] that taste like dog poo
[2562.84 → 2564.08] so that they won't eat more of them
[2564.08 → 2564.52] or whatever,
[2564.68 → 2564.88] right?
[2565.26 → 2565.76] Like we were,
[2565.76 → 2566.42] it was supposed to be
[2566.42 → 2567.50] very conversational.
[2568.28 → 2568.68] Um,
[2568.82 → 2571.00] and it just never really happened,
[2571.36 → 2573.86] but this is how they do it.
[2574.36 → 2575.94] They get a second
[2575.94 → 2576.64] or a third
[2576.64 → 2577.72] or a fourth generation
[2577.72 → 2578.24] of this
[2578.24 → 2580.64] is loaded to the gills
[2580.64 → 2581.46] with,
[2581.52 → 2581.76] you know,
[2581.82 → 2583.40] machine learning hardware in it
[2583.40 → 2584.12] so that it's like
[2584.12 → 2585.60] really understanding
[2585.60 → 2586.50] what it's seeing.
[2586.58 → 2587.34] It doesn't just see,
[2587.34 → 2588.80] it understands
[2588.80 → 2591.10] and is linked together
[2591.10 → 2592.30] with all your Echo dots
[2592.30 → 2593.38] and all your security cameras
[2593.38 → 2593.80] and everything
[2593.80 → 2594.56] and they're basically
[2594.56 → 2595.96] just telling you
[2595.96 → 2596.56] where to go,
[2596.86 → 2598.60] asking you if
[2598.60 → 2600.08] they can order things
[2600.08 → 2600.36] for you.
[2600.46 → 2600.50] Yeah,
[2600.54 → 2601.40] Fukuyama predicted
[2601.40 → 2602.52] ads in your dreams.
[2602.68 → 2603.42] Hopefully we're
[2603.42 → 2604.84] pretty far away from that,
[2604.92 → 2605.06] but,
[2605.76 → 2606.70] okay,
[2606.76 → 2607.22] let's see.
[2607.22 → 2609.14] I feel like it's
[2609.14 → 2610.28] borderline forced
[2610.28 → 2611.20] watching stuff.
[2611.72 → 2612.10] Um,
[2612.20 → 2612.96] we've talked about that
[2612.96 → 2613.32] for a bit,
[2613.38 → 2614.58] like ads in,
[2614.68 → 2616.68] in VR and AR experiences,
[2616.82 → 2618.12] especially AR experiences.
[2618.78 → 2619.22] Um,
[2619.22 → 2620.24] if AR glasses
[2620.24 → 2621.30] finally ever
[2621.30 → 2623.38] get sleek enough
[2623.38 → 2624.44] that they take off,
[2625.04 → 2625.48] um,
[2626.16 → 2626.80] I feel like ads
[2626.80 → 2627.50] are going to be a
[2627.50 → 2629.72] horrible version
[2629.72 → 2630.36] of that experience.
[2630.50 → 2630.94] By the way,
[2630.94 → 2631.76] I saw a funny
[2631.76 → 2632.52] that I want to make sure
[2632.52 → 2632.82] I mentioned.
[2632.96 → 2634.20] It's way gone now,
[2634.20 → 2634.66] uh,
[2634.66 → 2635.34] but someone mentioned
[2635.34 → 2636.16] that they think
[2636.16 → 2636.66] the main reason
[2636.66 → 2637.16] why you wouldn't
[2637.16 → 2637.72] mind this TV
[2637.72 → 2638.12] is because you
[2638.12 → 2638.78] wouldn't see the ads
[2638.78 → 2639.12] anyway.
[2639.76 → 2640.16] Um,
[2640.46 → 2640.88] I thought that was
[2640.88 → 2641.32] pretty good.
[2641.56 → 2642.22] That was pretty good.
[2642.38 → 2642.60] Yeah.
[2642.94 → 2643.22] Yeah.
[2643.22 → 2643.58] I mean,
[2643.58 → 2644.38] I'm into it,
[2644.38 → 2644.98] but yeah,
[2644.98 → 2645.56] kind of brutal,
[2645.56 → 2649.06] but people are
[2649.06 → 2650.28] going to take these.
[2650.28 → 2651.08] So like,
[2651.08 → 2653.80] yeah,
[2653.80 → 2654.38] tablets,
[2654.62 → 2655.06] I mean,
[2655.44 → 2656.00] they're already
[2656.00 → 2656.74] monitoring everything
[2656.74 → 2657.60] you do on your tablet.
[2657.74 → 2658.16] I guess the only
[2658.16 → 2658.96] difference is that
[2658.96 → 2659.54] it could actually
[2659.54 → 2661.34] just outright have
[2661.34 → 2661.98] the camera on
[2661.98 → 2662.72] at all times.
[2662.72 → 2664.70] ads in Neuralink.
[2668.18 → 2668.66] Okay.
[2668.88 → 2669.58] I take back
[2669.58 → 2670.18] what I said.
[2670.38 → 2671.52] Maybe the commercials
[2671.52 → 2672.16] in Dreams
[2672.16 → 2673.66] are not that unrealistic.
[2674.16 → 2674.52] Yeah.
[2675.32 → 2675.80] Oh,
[2675.88 → 2676.26] man.
[2677.60 → 2678.16] It comes to
[2678.16 → 2678.76] just using that.
[2678.88 → 2679.04] Yeah.
[2681.62 → 2682.50] I'm high
[2682.50 → 2683.26] and just trying
[2683.26 → 2684.58] to enjoy tech bro talk
[2684.58 → 2685.32] and this is making
[2685.32 → 2686.30] me physically ill.
[2688.94 → 2689.38] Sorry,
[2689.52 → 2689.74] bro.
[2691.18 → 2692.44] I'm actually sorry.
[2692.44 → 2693.02] I didn't mean
[2693.02 → 2693.82] to get all
[2693.82 → 2696.76] all processor.
[2697.04 → 2697.22] Okay.
[2697.24 → 2697.72] I'm sorry.
[2697.82 → 2698.44] I didn't mean
[2698.44 → 2699.02] to get all
[2699.02 → 2700.24] amped up about this.
[2700.30 → 2700.66] I know you're
[2700.66 → 2701.60] trying to relax right now.
[2701.60 → 2701.98] Now he's going to get
[2701.98 → 2702.56] paranoid because
[2702.56 → 2703.18] you called him out.
[2703.38 → 2703.66] No,
[2703.72 → 2703.84] no,
[2703.88 → 2704.00] no,
[2704.02 → 2704.30] it's not.
[2704.30 → 2704.86] He's feeling
[2704.86 → 2705.84] very seen right now,
[2705.90 → 2706.10] man.
[2706.18 → 2706.42] No,
[2706.52 → 2706.64] no,
[2706.64 → 2707.80] it's not like that.
[2707.88 → 2708.56] It's not like that.
[2708.66 → 2708.80] Yeah.
[2708.98 → 2710.14] Everyone's okay.
[2710.18 → 2710.52] Look,
[2710.56 → 2711.48] everyone who's just
[2711.48 → 2712.32] trying to like
[2712.32 → 2713.80] lay back
[2713.80 → 2714.64] and relax
[2714.64 → 2715.44] and chill
[2715.44 → 2716.06] on a Friday.
[2716.66 → 2717.74] I'm so sorry.
[2717.82 → 2718.44] I hope you enjoy
[2718.44 → 2719.38] watching your
[2719.38 → 2720.94] brand-new telly.
[2720.94 → 2722.08] Yeah.
[2722.48 → 2723.32] You can now
[2723.32 → 2724.38] own for zero dollars.
[2724.70 → 2725.42] Have you considered
[2725.42 → 2726.24] shopping at
[2726.24 → 2727.06] cannabis dispensary
[2727.06 → 2727.60] dot com?
[2732.60 → 2733.56] Is that a thing?
[2734.02 → 2734.72] I don't know.
[2734.80 → 2734.98] Probably.
[2735.52 → 2736.28] I don't know what
[2736.28 → 2737.00] I just referred
[2737.00 → 2737.90] people to.
[2740.34 → 2740.78] Okay.
[2740.88 → 2741.26] Apparently,
[2741.26 → 2741.98] someone's just
[2741.98 → 2743.38] camping that domain.
[2743.80 → 2744.46] That's probably good.
[2744.46 → 2744.74] Yeah,
[2744.76 → 2745.38] that's probably
[2745.38 → 2746.14] for the best.
[2748.98 → 2749.50] But yeah,
[2749.52 → 2749.92] I don't know.
[2750.12 → 2750.30] Like,
[2750.50 → 2750.72] yeah,
[2750.82 → 2751.52] what's the difference?
[2751.94 → 2752.22] Nothing.
[2752.98 → 2753.74] It's just another
[2753.74 → 2754.28] one of those things
[2754.28 → 2754.96] that I won't get
[2754.96 → 2755.80] for the same reason
[2755.80 → 2756.58] why I don't have
[2756.58 → 2757.68] a bunch of echo dots
[2757.68 → 2758.56] and all this other
[2758.56 → 2759.16] type of stuff.
[2759.16 → 2759.70] But like,
[2760.34 → 2761.20] at the same time,
[2761.20 → 2762.12] I carry my phone
[2762.12 → 2762.64] on me.
[2763.04 → 2763.44] Yeah.
[2763.82 → 2764.86] And I have a robot
[2764.86 → 2765.70] vacuum that has
[2765.70 → 2766.40] a camera on it.
[2766.52 → 2766.74] Yeah.
[2766.92 → 2767.20] You know,
[2767.20 → 2768.02] what's really sad
[2768.02 → 2769.06] is that
[2769.06 → 2770.06] the people
[2770.06 → 2771.24] who are going
[2771.24 → 2772.04] to be
[2772.04 → 2774.80] editorially,
[2775.54 → 2776.38] exploitative,
[2776.46 → 2776.64] whatever,
[2776.76 → 2777.26] the people who are
[2777.26 → 2777.92] going to be marketed
[2777.92 → 2779.10] to so aggressively
[2779.10 → 2779.58] here,
[2779.72 → 2781.12] are the people
[2781.12 → 2782.32] who can't afford
[2782.32 → 2784.48] to just buy the TV.
[2784.90 → 2786.38] Because this isn't
[2786.38 → 2787.54] a concern for me.
[2787.96 → 2789.30] I'm not choosing
[2789.30 → 2790.88] between having a TV
[2790.88 → 2791.44] at all
[2791.44 → 2793.28] and not having a TV.
[2793.50 → 2793.64] Right?
[2793.66 → 2793.80] Like,
[2793.82 → 2794.70] if my TV broke,
[2794.98 → 2796.50] I would just
[2796.50 → 2797.84] pay for it
[2797.84 → 2798.36] to be repaired
[2798.36 → 2800.10] or pay for a new one.
[2800.56 → 2800.96] I don't,
[2801.10 → 2802.04] this is not,
[2802.12 → 2803.26] this is not
[2803.26 → 2804.24] cutting my life
[2804.24 → 2804.82] into pieces,
[2805.08 → 2806.10] my last resort,
[2806.56 → 2807.20] suffocation,
[2807.84 → 2808.10] you know,
[2808.14 → 2808.66] no breathing.
[2808.96 → 2809.10] Right?
[2809.46 → 2809.80] Like,
[2809.88 → 2810.48] I...
[2810.48 → 2815.22] Anywho.
[2816.90 → 2817.92] But for a lot
[2817.92 → 2818.48] of people,
[2818.70 → 2820.08] it's not an option.
[2820.70 → 2821.84] They don't have
[2821.84 → 2822.80] $500.
[2823.68 → 2824.66] And something like
[2824.66 → 2825.22] this could be
[2825.22 → 2826.56] really appealing.
[2827.10 → 2828.18] And I guess
[2828.18 → 2828.60] what I,
[2828.72 → 2829.24] what I just,
[2829.38 → 2830.34] what I fear for
[2830.34 → 2831.46] is that it's going
[2831.46 → 2832.30] to cost them
[2832.30 → 2833.62] more than $500.
[2835.06 → 2835.54] You know,
[2835.56 → 2836.30] it's an interesting thing.
[2836.36 → 2836.84] It says if,
[2836.92 → 2837.68] if users...
[2837.68 → 2838.28] It's expensive to be poor.
[2838.44 → 2839.54] If users opt out
[2839.54 → 2840.36] of data collection,
[2840.64 → 2841.64] they'll have to return
[2841.64 → 2842.24] the television
[2842.24 → 2843.16] or have their credit card
[2843.16 → 2843.64] charged $500.
[2843.64 → 2844.28] What if they've already
[2844.28 → 2845.18] had their data collected
[2845.18 → 2845.74] for three years?
[2845.84 → 2846.30] I don't know.
[2846.38 → 2847.38] It doesn't say
[2847.38 → 2849.46] if you just like
[2849.46 → 2850.98] don't turn the TV on.
[2853.34 → 2854.08] Could they tell
[2854.08 → 2854.60] if you taped
[2854.60 → 2855.52] over the bottom screen?
[2855.52 → 2856.18] That's the type
[2856.18 → 2856.62] of stuff I'm
[2856.62 → 2857.04] wondering about.
[2857.14 → 2857.24] Like,
[2857.30 → 2857.90] what if you had
[2857.90 → 2859.90] like a board
[2859.90 → 2860.82] or something
[2860.82 → 2861.94] that like covered
[2861.94 → 2862.34] it up?
[2862.62 → 2863.14] I guess you'd still
[2863.14 → 2864.02] have sound problems.
[2864.28 → 2865.30] You have a mirror.
[2865.86 → 2867.12] You have a black mirror.
[2867.20 → 2867.90] You make it track
[2867.90 → 2868.32] itself.
[2868.44 → 2868.90] You make it,
[2868.94 → 2869.06] yeah,
[2869.12 → 2870.22] you make the camera
[2870.22 → 2871.20] watch the TV.
[2871.90 → 2872.64] Let's see how
[2872.64 → 2873.50] you like it.
[2874.86 → 2876.32] It does in the TOS.
[2876.52 → 2876.90] So wait,
[2876.92 → 2877.56] it has to be
[2877.56 → 2878.14] plugged in?
[2878.60 → 2879.24] What if you have
[2879.24 → 2879.86] like an extended
[2879.86 → 2880.64] power outage?
[2881.34 → 2881.74] Wow.
[2884.60 → 2885.28] I'm just trying
[2885.28 → 2886.16] to figure out
[2886.16 → 2886.60] like all the
[2886.60 → 2887.04] different ways
[2887.04 → 2887.84] people could abuse
[2887.84 → 2888.36] this thing.
[2888.50 → 2889.20] That is unreal.
[2889.42 → 2890.52] Could you pinhole it?
[2890.64 → 2891.32] I don't know.
[2892.14 → 2893.16] I don't know.
[2894.82 → 2896.24] You have to have
[2896.24 → 2897.02] the internet connected
[2897.02 → 2897.76] to it according to
[2897.76 → 2898.18] the TOS.
[2898.30 → 2898.44] Yeah,
[2898.52 → 2899.10] so they'll know.
[2900.02 → 2900.78] That's wild.
[2901.50 → 2902.16] That's pretty nuts.
[2902.24 → 2902.54] That's wild.
[2902.66 → 2902.82] Yeah,
[2902.96 → 2904.10] all processor again
[2904.10 → 2905.00] in here with the
[2905.00 → 2905.62] real truths.
[2905.86 → 2906.60] Overdraft charges
[2906.60 → 2907.36] are worth millions
[2907.36 → 2908.20] of dollars a year.
[2908.36 → 2909.50] That is disgusting.
[2909.50 → 2910.70] It's actually
[2910.70 → 2911.18] really stupid.
[2911.18 → 2912.02] Like charging people
[2912.02 → 2912.96] for having no money.
[2913.06 → 2914.18] The first time I got
[2914.18 → 2915.38] charged for overdraft,
[2915.48 → 2916.02] I was like,
[2916.84 → 2917.42] why didn't the
[2917.42 → 2918.38] transaction fail?
[2919.40 → 2920.40] They have that
[2920.40 → 2920.80] function.
[2920.98 → 2921.96] I know for a fact
[2921.96 → 2922.52] they have that
[2922.52 → 2923.08] function because
[2923.08 → 2923.78] I've seen it.
[2924.42 → 2925.24] So how did I
[2925.24 → 2926.04] manage to take out
[2926.04 → 2927.22] 18 cents more
[2927.22 → 2927.82] money than I
[2927.82 → 2928.66] actually had?
[2928.78 → 2928.88] Oh,
[2928.98 → 2929.52] 18 cents?
[2929.64 → 2929.86] Nope.
[2930.18 → 2931.40] $20 and 18 cents
[2931.40 → 2931.76] now.
[2933.06 → 2933.50] Ridiculous.
[2933.64 → 2934.16] And for me,
[2934.22 → 2934.92] it wasn't a matter
[2934.92 → 2935.62] of like I didn't
[2935.62 → 2936.34] have money or
[2936.34 → 2936.62] anything.
[2936.74 → 2937.02] I just,
[2937.22 → 2937.94] like I forget.
[2938.06 → 2938.88] I like used the
[2938.88 → 2939.20] wrong,
[2939.20 → 2939.90] I keyed in the
[2939.90 → 2940.52] wrong account
[2940.52 → 2941.14] or something like
[2941.14 → 2941.32] that.
[2941.36 → 2941.74] Like this was
[2941.74 → 2942.16] when I was a
[2942.16 → 2943.46] teenager and I
[2943.46 → 2944.12] still managed my
[2944.12 → 2944.74] own finances.
[2945.22 → 2946.06] But I,
[2946.12 → 2947.52] I was just,
[2947.60 → 2948.08] I was like
[2948.08 → 2948.56] outraged.
[2948.60 → 2948.88] I was like,
[2948.90 → 2949.30] this is the
[2949.30 → 2949.88] the stupidest thing
[2949.88 → 2950.10] ever.
[2950.16 → 2950.28] Well,
[2950.28 → 2950.62] it is.
[2950.82 → 2951.44] It's disgusting.
[2951.82 → 2951.98] Yeah.
[2953.38 → 2953.82] 35,
[2953.98 → 2954.64] it's $35.
[2955.16 → 2955.80] When I was
[2955.80 → 2956.36] growing up,
[2956.52 → 2956.84] the
[2956.84 → 2958.36] the over
[2958.36 → 2959.14] whatever fee
[2959.14 → 2959.98] was 20 bucks.
[2959.98 → 2960.18] Yeah,
[2960.20 → 2960.60] I think it was
[2960.60 → 2961.00] like five or
[2961.00 → 2961.48] 10 bucks when
[2961.48 → 2961.82] I was a kid.
[2961.84 → 2962.36] Someone said
[2962.36 → 2963.30] $45.
[2963.92 → 2965.32] Oh my God.
[2965.32 → 2966.00] that is just
[2966.00 → 2968.52] outright predatory
[2968.52 → 2969.24] and should be
[2969.24 → 2969.64] illegal.
[2970.20 → 2970.68] The amount of,
[2970.80 → 2971.06] man,
[2971.12 → 2971.48] the amount of,
[2971.54 → 2972.58] we just need like a
[2972.58 → 2974.16] we just need like a
[2974.16 → 2975.26] common sense counsel,
[2975.36 → 2975.58] man.
[2976.70 → 2977.44] Like just.
[2977.88 → 2979.10] Are we massively
[2979.10 → 2980.78] abusing people that
[2980.78 → 2981.74] are having a hard
[2981.74 → 2982.16] time?
[2982.78 → 2983.18] If,
[2983.36 → 2984.92] maybe we shouldn't do
[2984.92 → 2985.20] that.
[2985.28 → 2985.42] Yeah.
[2985.42 → 2985.74] if,
[2986.10 → 2986.80] if no.
[2987.44 → 2987.90] Okay.
[2988.04 → 2988.26] Yeah.
[2988.34 → 2989.06] If yes,
[2989.86 → 2990.34] then.
[2992.86 → 2993.30] And.
[2994.14 → 2994.66] No.
[2996.32 → 2996.72] Yeah.
[2998.34 → 2998.74] Okay.
[2998.96 → 3000.04] Now's the time for
[3000.04 → 3000.72] us to explain
[3000.72 → 3001.50] merch messages
[3001.50 → 3002.42] and I want to make
[3002.42 → 3003.14] it really clears.
[3003.48 → 3004.34] Merch messages
[3004.34 → 3005.62] are for people
[3005.62 → 3006.96] who have the
[3006.96 → 3007.84] disposable income,
[3007.94 → 3009.50] not for people
[3009.50 → 3010.50] to be exploited.
[3010.72 → 3011.16] Don't go into
[3011.16 → 3011.70] your overdraft,
[3011.82 → 3012.02] please.
[3012.14 → 3012.50] Please.
[3012.58 → 3012.96] No,
[3013.24 → 3013.58] please.
[3013.70 → 3014.10] No.
[3014.10 → 3015.48] If you don't
[3015.48 → 3016.22] already have the
[3016.22 → 3016.64] money in your
[3016.64 → 3017.36] bank account to
[3017.36 → 3017.82] pay off your
[3017.82 → 3018.46] credit card for
[3018.46 → 3018.98] this month,
[3019.58 → 3020.72] do not use your
[3020.72 → 3021.56] credit card on a
[3021.56 → 3022.12] merch message.
[3022.22 → 3023.56] But if you're in a
[3023.56 → 3024.88] good state and
[3024.88 → 3025.84] you're ready to go,
[3026.00 → 3026.82] merch messages are
[3026.82 → 3028.00] the way to interact
[3028.00 → 3029.14] with the show.
[3029.46 → 3030.32] Don't send a super
[3030.32 → 3030.68] chat.
[3030.80 → 3031.58] Don't send Twitch
[3031.58 → 3032.24] bits or whatever.
[3032.64 → 3033.20] Send a merch
[3033.20 → 3033.60] message.
[3033.68 → 3034.94] Go to LTTstore.com.
[3035.02 → 3035.60] Check out any of
[3035.60 → 3036.48] the awesome stuff
[3036.48 → 3037.08] that we have over
[3037.08 → 3037.36] there.
[3037.76 → 3038.38] Do we have any
[3038.38 → 3039.22] product launches or
[3039.22 → 3039.78] anything like that
[3039.78 → 3040.22] that we need to
[3040.22 → 3040.54] talk about?
[3040.86 → 3040.88] Yeah,
[3041.18 → 3041.64] actually.
[3041.78 → 3041.92] Oh,
[3042.00 → 3042.38] we do.
[3042.48 → 3042.58] Oh,
[3042.64 → 3043.20] we have some cool
[3043.20 → 3043.56] new stuff.
[3043.64 → 3043.80] Anyway,
[3043.80 → 3044.32] I'll get to that
[3044.32 → 3044.76] in a second.
[3045.06 → 3045.46] But first,
[3045.52 → 3045.88] you head over
[3045.88 → 3046.58] there and in the
[3046.58 → 3046.88] checkout,
[3047.10 → 3047.36] you're going to
[3047.36 → 3048.10] see a box when
[3048.10 → 3048.58] we're live.
[3049.14 → 3049.48] In the cart.
[3049.66 → 3050.02] Thank you.
[3050.26 → 3050.56] You're going to
[3050.56 → 3051.22] see a box when
[3051.22 → 3051.76] you're live that
[3051.76 → 3052.40] will prompt you
[3052.40 → 3052.92] to send a
[3052.92 → 3053.62] merch message.
[3053.82 → 3054.34] That merch
[3054.34 → 3055.22] message goes to
[3055.22 → 3055.82] one of a few
[3055.82 → 3056.20] places.
[3056.36 → 3056.92] It goes to our
[3056.92 → 3057.60] producer Dan.
[3058.32 → 3058.72] Well,
[3058.80 → 3059.08] actually,
[3059.32 → 3060.08] they all go to
[3060.08 → 3060.60] producer Dan.
[3060.88 → 3061.56] Then from there,
[3061.86 → 3062.64] producer Dan might
[3062.64 → 3063.54] reply to you and
[3063.54 → 3063.98] you'll see your
[3063.98 → 3064.84] reply down there.
[3065.16 → 3066.12] Or you might just
[3066.12 → 3066.66] see your message
[3066.66 → 3067.86] get pushed onto
[3067.86 → 3068.58] the stream so you
[3068.58 → 3068.92] can be like,
[3069.00 → 3069.12] hi,
[3069.16 → 3069.50] mom.
[3069.86 → 3070.24] Or like,
[3070.66 → 3071.04] hi,
[3071.04 → 3072.36] mom or whatever.
[3072.52 → 3072.98] It doesn't really
[3072.98 → 3073.28] matter.
[3073.76 → 3075.44] Or you might have
[3075.44 → 3076.42] your message curated
[3076.42 → 3077.20] and it'll be
[3077.20 → 3078.12] something that Luke
[3078.12 → 3079.00] or I or Luke and
[3079.00 → 3080.24] I or sometimes Dan
[3080.24 → 3081.76] will also reply to
[3081.76 → 3082.92] during WAN show
[3082.92 → 3083.58] after dark.
[3083.72 → 3084.48] We'll do a couple
[3084.48 → 3085.24] of them now just to
[3085.24 → 3085.64] kind of show you
[3085.64 → 3086.30] guys how it works.
[3086.78 → 3087.54] But first,
[3087.68 → 3088.34] I want to show you
[3088.34 → 3089.32] what we've got on
[3089.32 → 3090.20] the site.
[3090.74 → 3091.58] We are launching
[3091.58 → 3092.68] two new products
[3092.68 → 3094.60] this week and one
[3094.60 → 3095.66] of them is a pretty
[3095.66 → 3096.14] big announcement.
[3096.60 → 3096.82] Yeah.
[3096.82 → 3097.72] This is the official
[3097.72 → 3099.34] logo for LTT Labs.
[3099.58 → 3099.88] Yeah.
[3100.18 → 3100.64] What do you think?
[3101.36 → 3101.96] I actually,
[3102.14 → 3102.96] I like it.
[3103.04 → 3103.86] It's subtle.
[3104.08 → 3104.74] You can just say
[3104.74 → 3105.28] you don't like it.
[3105.42 → 3105.60] No,
[3105.64 → 3106.22] I'm not against it.
[3106.22 → 3106.62] You can just say
[3106.62 → 3107.22] you don't like it.
[3107.38 → 3108.48] I immediately saw
[3108.48 → 3109.18] it as a heat sink
[3109.18 → 3110.66] because when Gary
[3110.66 → 3111.26] and I were talking
[3111.26 → 3111.60] about it,
[3111.66 → 3112.38] he pulled out a
[3112.38 → 3113.04] heat sink and was
[3113.04 → 3113.22] like,
[3113.28 → 3114.02] this is the logo.
[3114.14 → 3114.44] And I was like,
[3114.50 → 3114.68] what?
[3114.74 → 3115.30] And then he showed
[3115.30 → 3115.74] me the digital
[3115.74 → 3116.00] version.
[3116.08 → 3116.28] I was like,
[3116.28 → 3116.54] okay.
[3117.08 → 3117.64] But you wouldn't
[3117.64 → 3118.12] have known it was
[3118.12 → 3118.56] a heat sink?
[3118.74 → 3118.92] No,
[3118.98 → 3119.08] no,
[3119.14 → 3120.24] I see it as a
[3120.24 → 3120.52] heat sink,
[3120.62 → 3121.08] but people have
[3121.08 → 3121.52] brought up that it
[3121.52 → 3122.16] looks like a file
[3122.16 → 3122.48] folder.
[3124.76 → 3125.48] Like one of those
[3125.48 → 3126.20] things that like,
[3126.58 → 3127.12] one of those like
[3127.12 → 3127.86] trays that hold
[3127.86 → 3128.24] files.
[3128.46 → 3128.80] Yeah,
[3129.00 → 3129.98] I guess so.
[3130.08 → 3130.64] But I think with
[3130.64 → 3131.42] the context of
[3131.42 → 3133.12] having labs there,
[3133.22 → 3133.64] I think you can
[3133.64 → 3134.06] kind of put it
[3134.06 → 3134.30] together.
[3134.34 → 3134.44] Yeah,
[3134.46 → 3135.06] I'm okay with it.
[3135.20 → 3135.36] Yeah.
[3135.80 → 3136.00] Yeah.
[3136.00 → 3136.88] I'm just happy we
[3136.88 → 3137.52] have a logo.
[3137.90 → 3138.16] Yeah,
[3138.20 → 3139.00] we finally have a
[3139.00 → 3139.22] logo,
[3139.38 → 3139.76] which is sick.
[3140.00 → 3141.02] It looks really
[3141.02 → 3142.20] great in the
[3142.20 → 3143.10] gradient version,
[3143.26 → 3145.12] which is not here.
[3145.24 → 3145.74] So cool.
[3145.80 → 3146.38] I guess you guys,
[3146.50 → 3147.30] I can debut that
[3147.30 → 3147.64] later.
[3148.00 → 3148.28] Anyway,
[3148.28 → 3149.16] it's available in
[3149.16 → 3150.08] six different colours.
[3150.40 → 3150.86] This is a
[3150.86 → 3151.88] pre-sale item.
[3152.30 → 3153.02] All shirts will be
[3153.02 → 3153.60] printed following
[3153.60 → 3154.18] purchase and may
[3154.18 → 3154.64] take one to two
[3154.64 → 3155.22] weeks to print and
[3155.22 → 3155.40] ship.
[3155.58 → 3156.30] Please do note
[3156.30 → 3156.48] this.
[3156.54 → 3157.14] This is highlighted.
[3157.28 → 3157.66] Now there's no
[3157.66 → 3158.30] excuse for not
[3158.30 → 3158.58] noticing.
[3159.10 → 3159.50] Also,
[3159.68 → 3160.60] we've got the
[3160.60 → 3161.18] same thing,
[3161.46 → 3161.70] but.
[3162.14 → 3163.30] I'm aware it's a
[3163.30 → 3164.24] small microcontroller
[3164.24 → 3164.58] heat sink.
[3164.80 → 3165.22] A hoodie.
[3167.50 → 3167.74] Woo.
[3167.74 → 3168.26] Goofs.
[3168.62 → 3170.06] And we've done a
[3170.06 → 3171.56] little repeat of
[3171.56 → 3172.42] what we did when we
[3172.42 → 3172.80] did our first.
[3172.80 → 3173.42] I noticed that.
[3173.68 → 3174.84] Linus Tech Tips
[3174.84 → 3175.96] branded merch.
[3176.42 → 3177.58] So if you pick up
[3177.58 → 3178.76] the Labs shirt or
[3178.76 → 3179.60] the Labs hoodie,
[3179.60 → 3181.46] it is possible that
[3181.46 → 3182.18] we will reprint
[3182.18 → 3182.96] these in the future
[3182.96 → 3183.66] or that they'll be
[3183.66 → 3184.54] available on the
[3184.54 → 3184.92] regular,
[3185.56 → 3187.14] but we will never
[3187.14 → 3188.98] do another one with
[3188.98 → 3189.96] a hashtag first at
[3189.96 → 3190.30] the back.
[3190.46 → 3191.26] So really appreciate
[3191.26 → 3192.36] everyone for supporting
[3192.36 → 3193.42] this first merch drop
[3193.42 → 3195.82] for the Lab and our
[3195.82 → 3197.12] mission that we're on
[3197.12 → 3197.42] here.
[3197.64 → 3198.66] And now hold on just a
[3198.66 → 3199.40] gosh darn second here.
[3199.44 → 3199.56] Oh,
[3199.62 → 3199.80] cool.
[3200.44 → 3201.72] You can change the
[3201.72 → 3202.26] text colour.
[3202.38 → 3202.80] Logo colour,
[3202.88 → 3203.02] yeah.
[3203.14 → 3203.32] Oh,
[3203.40 → 3204.44] I actually didn't know
[3204.44 → 3205.08] we had that power.
[3205.26 → 3205.82] That's very cool.
[3206.98 → 3207.62] What else did I want to
[3207.62 → 3208.04] talk about?
[3208.30 → 3208.70] Oh,
[3209.20 → 3209.52] notebooks.
[3209.70 → 3209.90] Oh,
[3209.98 → 3210.84] notebooks are back in
[3210.84 → 3211.16] stock.
[3211.38 → 3211.56] Oh,
[3211.60 → 3212.20] that's awesome.
[3212.46 → 3212.92] Those were out of
[3212.92 → 3213.50] stock for a long
[3213.50 → 3213.80] time.
[3214.46 → 3214.74] All right,
[3214.82 → 3215.28] let's do a couple
[3215.28 → 3215.86] merch messages.
[3216.40 → 3218.80] Then I want to
[3218.80 → 3219.78] talk about.
[3220.20 → 3220.50] Hold on.
[3220.80 → 3221.30] Hold them off.
[3221.96 → 3222.36] There.
[3222.36 → 3222.56] Okay.
[3222.66 → 3222.92] Perfect.
[3223.08 → 3223.76] Perfect amount of
[3223.76 → 3223.96] teasing.
[3224.22 → 3224.40] Oh,
[3224.46 → 3224.68] okay.
[3224.94 → 3225.20] All right,
[3225.24 → 3225.40] Dan.
[3225.70 → 3226.12] Hit us.
[3226.66 → 3226.84] Sure.
[3226.96 → 3227.40] First up here,
[3227.44 → 3228.24] we've got lots today.
[3228.66 → 3228.78] Hi,
[3228.82 → 3229.04] DLL.
[3229.28 → 3230.08] What's an example
[3230.08 → 3231.30] other than Luke of
[3231.30 → 3232.00] someone you've hired
[3232.00 → 3233.18] for X role then
[3233.18 → 3234.04] discovered they're
[3234.04 → 3235.06] better in Y role?
[3235.06 → 3235.92] Oh,
[3235.98 → 3236.22] I mean,
[3236.22 → 3237.42] I think that
[3237.42 → 3238.28] didn't take long.
[3239.02 → 3239.74] I mean,
[3239.88 → 3240.46] Brandon,
[3240.92 → 3242.82] Brandon Lee was hired
[3242.82 → 3243.54] as an editor.
[3244.12 → 3244.24] Oh,
[3244.30 → 3244.64] was he?
[3244.96 → 3245.24] Yeah.
[3245.74 → 3246.50] I didn't know that.
[3246.74 → 3247.08] Remember,
[3247.20 → 3248.06] he worked on the
[3248.06 → 3248.86] Steel Series set.
[3249.66 → 3250.62] He had his editing
[3250.62 → 3251.66] station up in the
[3251.66 → 3253.48] office upstairs at my
[3253.48 → 3253.96] house,
[3254.10 → 3255.36] not at the Langley
[3255.36 → 3255.58] house.
[3255.76 → 3255.84] Man,
[3256.72 → 3257.90] I forgot we had a
[3257.90 → 3258.54] Steel Series set.
[3258.64 → 3259.60] I remember all of
[3259.60 → 3259.92] this now.
[3260.00 → 3260.14] Yep.
[3260.24 → 3260.42] Yeah.
[3260.42 → 3262.22] So,
[3263.02 → 3264.02] honestly,
[3264.20 → 3264.88] the list probably
[3264.88 → 3266.14] goes on and on
[3266.14 → 3266.82] realistically.
[3267.58 → 3267.82] I mean,
[3267.90 → 3268.52] once you've had
[3268.52 → 3269.50] people for a
[3269.50 → 3270.14] really long period
[3270.14 → 3270.54] of time,
[3270.72 → 3271.28] it's not that
[3271.28 → 3271.90] uncommon that
[3271.90 → 3272.28] they'll swim
[3272.28 → 3272.86] through a few
[3272.86 → 3273.70] different sets
[3273.70 → 3274.44] of responsibilities.
[3274.72 → 3275.26] We hired Colton
[3275.26 → 3275.82] for the business
[3275.82 → 3276.48] team and found
[3276.48 → 3277.02] out that really
[3277.02 → 3277.52] his talents
[3277.52 → 3278.14] were better suited
[3278.14 → 3279.08] for like waste
[3279.08 → 3279.54] management,
[3279.74 → 3280.38] janitorial.
[3280.50 → 3280.94] He's a great
[3280.94 → 3281.94] piñata as well.
[3282.16 → 3282.34] Yeah.
[3282.82 → 3282.98] Yeah.
[3286.46 → 3287.38] Hit me again.
[3288.42 → 3288.64] Yeah,
[3288.68 → 3288.82] sure.
[3289.32 → 3289.72] Hi,
[3289.82 → 3290.20] LLD.
[3290.74 → 3291.26] Congratulations
[3291.26 → 3292.28] on your
[3292.28 → 3292.82] retirement.
[3293.66 → 3294.30] What's your
[3294.30 → 3295.06] thoughts on the
[3295.06 → 3296.24] slow drop of
[3296.24 → 3297.00] the 40 Series
[3297.00 → 3297.78] Nvidia cards?
[3298.10 → 3298.40] Been waiting
[3298.40 → 3298.96] months for
[3298.96 → 3299.70] laptops in
[3299.70 → 3300.42] Australia with
[3300.42 → 3301.36] a 4070 but
[3301.36 → 3302.00] no end in
[3302.00 → 3302.20] sight.
[3303.14 → 3303.66] Man,
[3303.80 → 3304.28] that's a
[3304.28 → 3305.68] good question.
[3305.80 → 3306.12] I actually
[3306.12 → 3306.60] didn't know
[3306.60 → 3307.20] that there was
[3307.20 → 3308.02] a supply issue
[3308.02 → 3309.08] on 4070
[3309.08 → 3310.06] based laptops.
[3310.88 → 3311.40] By slow
[3311.40 → 3311.70] drops,
[3311.76 → 3312.10] I kind of
[3312.10 → 3312.42] thought you
[3312.42 → 3312.82] meant maybe
[3312.82 → 3313.28] like the
[3313.28 → 3313.82] staggered
[3313.82 → 3314.38] rollout where
[3314.38 → 3314.76] they've
[3314.76 → 3315.28] launched the
[3315.28 → 3316.16] lineup sort
[3316.16 → 3316.54] of one
[3316.54 → 3317.06] card at a
[3317.06 → 3317.32] time.
[3317.68 → 3318.04] But that's
[3318.04 → 3318.44] pretty much
[3318.44 → 3318.94] par for the
[3318.94 → 3319.34] course for
[3319.34 → 3319.82] them because
[3319.82 → 3320.42] for Nvidia,
[3320.76 → 3321.82] it's very
[3321.82 → 3322.70] beneficial to
[3322.70 → 3323.16] have people
[3323.16 → 3323.98] talking about
[3323.98 → 3324.40] them all the
[3324.40 → 3324.60] time.
[3324.68 → 3324.82] I mean,
[3324.86 → 3325.18] we found
[3325.18 → 3325.48] this on
[3325.48 → 3326.16] LTT Store.
[3326.60 → 3327.04] One of the
[3327.04 → 3327.62] the best things
[3327.62 → 3328.06] that I can
[3328.06 → 3328.58] do to sell
[3328.58 → 3329.14] more water
[3329.14 → 3330.18] bottles is
[3330.18 → 3330.56] to talk
[3330.56 → 3331.04] about a
[3331.04 → 3331.44] cool new
[3331.44 → 3332.00] shirt design.
[3332.14 → 3332.32] So you
[3332.32 → 3332.68] guys go,
[3332.80 → 3332.90] oh,
[3333.00 → 3333.44] sick shirt.
[3334.28 → 3334.52] Hey,
[3334.60 → 3335.14] while I'm at
[3335.14 → 3335.28] it,
[3335.34 → 3335.72] I might as
[3335.72 → 3336.12] well throw a
[3336.12 → 3336.56] water bottle
[3336.56 → 3337.06] in since I
[3337.06 → 3337.34] got to pay
[3337.34 → 3337.68] the shipping
[3337.68 → 3338.34] fees anyway.
[3338.56 → 3339.56] So sick.
[3339.56 → 3340.88] So that's
[3340.88 → 3341.94] Nvidia for
[3341.94 → 3342.08] you,
[3342.12 → 3342.26] right?
[3342.34 → 3342.64] Like if
[3342.64 → 3343.42] they launch
[3343.42 → 3343.64] a new
[3343.64 → 3344.38] GPU that's
[3344.38 → 3345.06] very competitive,
[3345.50 → 3346.20] it creates a
[3346.20 → 3346.86] news cycle where
[3346.86 → 3347.54] everybody's talking
[3347.54 → 3348.80] about it and
[3348.80 → 3349.42] oh,
[3349.52 → 3349.98] you're launching
[3349.98 → 3351.24] a 4070 Ti,
[3351.50 → 3352.00] but you know
[3352.00 → 3352.22] what?
[3352.28 → 3352.68] I'm like,
[3352.72 → 3353.38] I'm flush with
[3353.38 → 3353.74] cash.
[3353.80 → 3354.20] I don't want a
[3354.20 → 3354.92] 4070 Ti,
[3355.02 → 3355.42] but if you make
[3355.42 → 3356.50] a good 4070 Ti,
[3356.64 → 3356.86] I bet your
[3356.86 → 3357.66] 4090 is pretty
[3357.66 → 3358.46] good, and you go
[3358.46 → 3359.08] buy one of those,
[3359.14 → 3359.30] right?
[3359.34 → 3359.70] It's just
[3359.70 → 3360.48] beneficial for
[3360.48 → 3361.58] companies to,
[3361.68 → 3361.84] you know,
[3361.90 → 3362.40] they say there's
[3362.40 → 3362.98] no such thing as
[3362.98 → 3363.56] bad publicity,
[3363.70 → 3363.84] right?
[3363.84 → 3364.62] It's beneficial for
[3364.62 → 3365.20] them to be talked
[3365.20 → 3365.92] about constantly.
[3366.44 → 3367.66] So that's why
[3367.66 → 3368.10] you're going to
[3368.10 → 3369.58] see this slow
[3369.58 → 3370.08] roll.
[3370.20 → 3370.92] They kind of drag
[3370.92 → 3371.58] it out for as
[3371.58 → 3372.06] long as they
[3372.06 → 3373.34] can and at
[3373.34 → 3374.50] every stop,
[3374.58 → 3375.34] at every product,
[3375.70 → 3376.38] there's the
[3376.38 → 3377.46] announcement and
[3377.46 → 3377.80] there's the
[3377.80 → 3378.66] unboxing embargo
[3378.66 → 3379.52] and there's the
[3379.52 → 3380.92] review embargo and
[3380.92 → 3381.62] then there's the
[3381.62 → 3382.66] announcement of a
[3382.66 → 3383.46] game bundle that
[3383.46 → 3384.06] we're doing and
[3384.06 → 3384.52] then there's the
[3384.52 → 3385.18] new feature that
[3385.18 → 3386.08] we've said we
[3386.08 → 3386.64] were going to do
[3386.64 → 3387.24] but now we have
[3387.24 → 3387.92] actually enabled.
[3388.14 → 3388.80] So they try to
[3388.80 → 3389.10] keep this
[3389.10 → 3389.88] communication going
[3389.88 → 3391.00] constantly,
[3391.16 → 3391.32] right?
[3392.34 → 3392.96] So that would be
[3392.96 → 3393.80] why they do that.
[3393.84 → 3394.66] As to why there
[3394.66 → 3395.42] are no 4070
[3395.42 → 3395.86] laptops,
[3395.92 → 3396.44] in stock in
[3396.44 → 3396.86] Australia,
[3396.86 → 3397.48] I would say it's
[3397.48 → 3398.12] probably because
[3398.12 → 3399.06] Australia is really
[3399.06 → 3399.46] far.
[3400.08 → 3400.94] I was just going to
[3400.94 → 3401.54] say I think that's
[3401.54 → 3402.28] probably more an
[3402.28 → 3403.00] Australia-specific
[3403.00 → 3403.46] issue.
[3403.88 → 3404.88] There are many of
[3404.88 → 3405.16] those.
[3405.34 → 3406.12] Yeah, all right.
[3406.20 → 3406.78] Give me one more,
[3406.84 → 3407.00] Dan.
[3407.10 → 3407.62] Like internet.
[3408.84 → 3410.06] With your stepping
[3410.06 → 3410.64] down, will
[3410.64 → 3411.52] sponsorships be
[3411.52 → 3412.22] changing at all,
[3412.32 → 3413.50] e.g. vetting
[3413.50 → 3414.02] products and
[3414.02 → 3414.72] companies or
[3414.72 → 3415.52] discontinuing them
[3415.52 → 3416.34] in situations like
[3416.34 → 3416.78] Anchor?
[3417.28 → 3418.16] I would expect
[3418.16 → 3418.44] not.
[3418.90 → 3419.48] Like I said,
[3419.70 → 3420.86] well, okay, so
[3420.86 → 3421.80] here's something that
[3421.80 → 3423.08] not everyone, I
[3423.08 → 3423.72] think, fully
[3423.72 → 3425.32] understood is
[3425.32 → 3427.18] the reporting
[3427.18 → 3428.54] structure between
[3428.54 → 3430.38] me and Taryn is
[3430.38 → 3432.36] kind of weird,
[3432.60 → 3432.88] right?
[3433.32 → 3434.60] So everybody,
[3434.84 → 3435.88] everybody on the
[3435.88 → 3437.24] pyramid, on the
[3437.24 → 3438.62] organizational chart,
[3438.98 → 3440.18] reports into the
[3440.18 → 3440.98] chief executive
[3440.98 → 3442.18] officer, including
[3442.18 → 3444.02] the CTO, the
[3444.02 → 3445.30] CVO, the C
[3445.30 → 3446.32] whatever O, all
[3446.32 → 3447.28] the C-suites,
[3447.36 → 3447.98] everyone below
[3447.98 → 3448.68] there ultimately
[3448.68 → 3449.80] reports to the
[3449.80 → 3450.10] CEO.
[3450.10 → 3451.42] so I report to
[3451.42 → 3452.34] Taryn and he
[3452.34 → 3452.90] can tell me what
[3452.90 → 3453.32] to do.
[3454.48 → 3455.30] Day to day.
[3456.42 → 3457.96] But, oh, go
[3457.96 → 3458.08] ahead.
[3458.22 → 3459.12] I see, I find
[3459.12 → 3459.88] this easier to
[3459.88 → 3460.56] understand because
[3460.56 → 3461.04] it's something I
[3461.04 → 3461.60] had to kind of wrap
[3461.60 → 3462.18] my head around too
[3462.18 → 3463.18] at one point, as
[3463.18 → 3463.82] there being two
[3463.82 → 3464.20] Sinuses.
[3464.94 → 3465.36] Sure.
[3465.98 → 3466.60] There's employee
[3466.60 → 3467.38] Linus and business
[3467.38 → 3467.96] owner Linus.
[3468.32 → 3468.72] Yes.
[3469.22 → 3470.04] So that's the
[3470.04 → 3470.82] thing, right?
[3471.06 → 3472.56] He's my boss and
[3472.56 → 3474.26] he can tell me what
[3474.26 → 3475.64] to do in a given,
[3475.84 → 3476.72] never mind a day,
[3476.84 → 3477.70] in a given week or
[3477.70 → 3478.30] a given month
[3478.30 → 3478.56] even.
[3479.50 → 3481.94] But then the
[3481.94 → 3484.16] CEO works at
[3484.16 → 3485.42] the, um,
[3485.66 → 3486.24] Behest.
[3486.72 → 3487.38] Yeah, sure.
[3487.46 → 3488.08] At the, at the
[3488.08 → 3488.92] behest of the
[3488.92 → 3490.08] shareholders and
[3490.08 → 3490.68] the directors.
[3491.14 → 3493.94] So I am the
[3493.94 → 3494.86] principal shareholder
[3494.86 → 3495.86] and I am one of
[3495.86 → 3496.76] only two directors
[3496.76 → 3497.54] of the company,
[3497.74 → 3498.44] the other being
[3498.44 → 3498.96] Yvonne.
[3499.18 → 3500.46] And so Taryn,
[3500.70 → 3501.66] when it comes to
[3501.66 → 3502.90] executing on our
[3502.90 → 3503.86] vision for the
[3503.86 → 3504.98] company, reports
[3504.98 → 3505.58] to us.
[3505.96 → 3506.90] So on the one
[3506.90 → 3508.12] hand, he's there
[3508.12 → 3509.48] as a check and
[3509.48 → 3510.38] balance to make
[3510.38 → 3511.06] sure that I am
[3511.06 → 3512.44] not screwing
[3512.44 → 3513.14] things up on a
[3513.14 → 3513.98] daily basis with
[3513.98 → 3514.68] respect to making
[3514.68 → 3515.20] sure that this
[3515.20 → 3516.14] place runs smoothly
[3516.14 → 3518.06] to kind of, you
[3518.06 → 3519.28] know, slap me if I
[3519.28 → 3520.66] am, if I am doing
[3520.66 → 3521.60] something that is,
[3521.66 → 3521.98] you know, really
[3521.98 → 3522.80] detrimental to one
[3522.80 → 3523.12] of the other
[3523.12 → 3525.06] departments or, uh,
[3525.08 → 3525.96] if I am, you
[3525.96 → 3526.60] know, training people
[3526.60 → 3527.12] in a way that's
[3527.12 → 3528.00] incorrect or whatever
[3528.00 → 3529.64] else to help us, to
[3529.64 → 3530.44] help us operate
[3530.44 → 3531.54] better, but not just
[3531.54 → 3532.40] like chief operating
[3532.40 → 3533.16] officer, like to
[3533.16 → 3535.68] help us, um, to
[3535.68 → 3536.94] help us execute on,
[3537.06 → 3537.84] on bigger picture
[3537.84 → 3538.52] things than just
[3538.52 → 3539.60] what a COO would
[3539.60 → 3539.82] do.
[3539.90 → 3540.50] So if he were to
[3540.50 → 3541.72] say like, look, I
[3541.72 → 3543.18] think our, our best
[3543.18 → 3543.84] use of our
[3543.84 → 3545.14] investment is going
[3545.14 → 3546.14] to be to start a
[3546.14 → 3547.08] system integrator,
[3547.16 → 3548.44] let's say, hypothetically,
[3548.96 → 3550.08] um, chief vision
[3550.08 → 3551.06] officer, I want a
[3551.06 → 3552.52] plan for how we're
[3552.52 → 3553.70] going to differentiate
[3553.70 → 3554.72] how we're going to
[3554.72 → 3556.52] market this thing and
[3556.52 → 3557.26] what that's going to
[3557.26 → 3557.74] look like.
[3557.88 → 3559.58] But then he would
[3559.58 → 3560.82] have to come to me
[3560.82 → 3562.66] above him and say,
[3562.66 → 3563.90] I want to spend
[3563.90 → 3566.02] $2 million starting
[3566.02 → 3566.48] in SI.
[3567.12 → 3568.00] Here's the plan.
[3568.62 → 3570.72] Um, and here's how
[3570.72 → 3571.46] we're going to market
[3571.46 → 3572.42] it, which like I
[3572.42 → 3572.82] gave him.
[3573.34 → 3574.34] So he gets to
[3574.34 → 3575.24] say, he gets to
[3575.24 → 3575.98] present my
[3575.98 → 3577.46] presentation to me.
[3577.82 → 3578.54] And then you get to
[3578.54 → 3579.34] pick yourself apart.
[3579.70 → 3579.96] Yeah.
[3582.78 → 3583.70] There's some weird
[3583.70 → 3584.18] loopiness.
[3584.38 → 3584.56] Yeah.
[3584.62 → 3585.72] And I do think that
[3585.72 → 3586.54] this is going to work
[3586.54 → 3587.80] really well.
[3587.80 → 3588.72] And the main reason
[3588.72 → 3589.70] for that is that,
[3589.70 → 3590.84] you know, I've worked
[3590.84 → 3591.94] with Baron longer
[3591.94 → 3592.62] than I've worked
[3592.62 → 3594.40] with most of the
[3594.40 → 3594.96] people here.
[3595.54 → 3596.36] And that's something
[3596.36 → 3597.48] that I feel there was
[3597.48 → 3598.28] a lot of anxiety
[3598.28 → 3600.06] about even from
[3600.06 → 3600.66] members of our
[3600.66 → 3601.40] current executive
[3601.40 → 3602.66] team because they
[3602.66 → 3603.96] didn't really, they
[3603.96 → 3604.82] didn't know him,
[3604.94 → 3605.28] right?
[3605.60 → 3606.48] To a lot of people,
[3606.50 → 3607.12] he was coming in as
[3607.12 → 3607.76] an outsider.
[3608.86 → 3609.96] There was a lot of
[3609.96 → 3611.12] anxiety, but I think
[3611.12 → 3612.48] I've been doing some
[3612.48 → 3613.18] thinking on this as
[3613.18 → 3613.32] well.
[3613.48 → 3614.30] I think that was
[3614.30 → 3614.70] good.
[3615.10 → 3616.04] I think if we were
[3616.04 → 3616.84] just all like, oh,
[3616.92 → 3617.94] sure, that would have
[3617.94 → 3618.98] been like kind of
[3618.98 → 3619.58] stupid.
[3619.58 → 3620.38] Well, I would have
[3620.38 → 3621.48] told you guys you're
[3621.48 → 3622.32] being idiots because
[3622.32 → 3623.24] that's not due
[3623.24 → 3623.38] diligence.
[3623.40 → 3624.06] Like it was right
[3624.06 → 3624.88] for us to question
[3624.88 → 3625.12] it.
[3627.96 → 3628.80] Here's a bit of a
[3628.80 → 3629.36] curveball.
[3629.80 → 3630.14] Yeah.
[3630.36 → 3631.00] I mean, throw it.
[3631.00 → 3632.04] Not a super major
[3632.04 → 3632.24] one.
[3632.40 → 3632.78] I'm ready.
[3635.04 → 3636.80] In like a weird way,
[3637.08 → 3637.92] and I don't know if
[3637.92 → 3639.16] you're ready for this
[3639.16 → 3639.38] or not.
[3639.42 → 3639.92] I know you're bad
[3639.92 → 3640.42] with compliments.
[3640.92 → 3642.06] I'm proud of you
[3642.06 → 3642.72] for doing this.
[3642.72 → 3643.20] Oh.
[3645.36 → 3645.84] Yeah.
[3646.84 → 3647.86] Because I think
[3647.86 → 3648.28] thank you.
[3648.28 → 3652.26] I think we both
[3652.26 → 3652.98] have this kind of
[3652.98 → 3654.04] tendency to just
[3654.04 → 3655.12] like be down to
[3655.12 → 3655.74] just like carry
[3655.74 → 3656.14] things.
[3657.98 → 3658.68] And you've been
[3658.68 → 3659.28] carrying this for
[3659.28 → 3660.52] way too long.
[3661.60 → 3662.36] And I know you
[3662.36 → 3663.00] have a hard time
[3663.00 → 3663.82] letting go of
[3663.82 → 3664.32] things too.
[3665.16 → 3666.20] So I feel like
[3666.20 → 3667.46] this was probably
[3667.46 → 3668.52] very difficult.
[3668.94 → 3669.54] It's been a rough
[3669.54 → 3669.88] week.
[3670.16 → 3670.36] Yeah.
[3671.30 → 3671.98] Honestly, it's
[3671.98 → 3672.78] been a rough long
[3672.78 → 3673.10] time.
[3673.20 → 3673.38] Yeah.
[3673.48 → 3673.86] You know.
[3673.86 → 3676.40] So like I'm
[3676.40 → 3677.30] I'm proud of you
[3677.30 → 3678.24] for actually
[3678.24 → 3682.00] being willing to
[3682.00 → 3682.96] do the thing that
[3682.96 → 3683.70] needed to be done
[3683.70 → 3684.56] to solve that
[3684.56 → 3684.98] problem.
[3685.14 → 3686.18] I was forced
[3686.18 → 3686.86] because that's
[3686.86 → 3687.16] tough.
[3687.44 → 3687.92] Okay.
[3688.06 → 3688.92] Not by a person,
[3689.06 → 3691.04] but there are
[3691.04 → 3691.92] worse ways you
[3691.92 → 3692.36] could have dealt
[3692.36 → 3692.80] with that.
[3692.92 → 3693.22] Sure.
[3693.56 → 3694.74] I don't know what
[3694.74 → 3695.62] I would have done
[3695.62 → 3696.92] if he hadn't taken
[3696.92 → 3697.56] the job though.
[3697.98 → 3698.30] Yeah.
[3698.30 → 3701.04] because while I
[3701.04 → 3702.86] definitely wanted
[3702.86 → 3704.10] and I solicited
[3704.10 → 3705.30] feedback from our
[3705.30 → 3706.06] leadership team
[3706.06 → 3707.10] about this hire,
[3707.80 → 3710.92] I wasn't that
[3710.92 → 3711.74] open to
[3711.74 → 3712.34] alternatives.
[3715.82 → 3717.56] That's one way
[3717.56 → 3718.20] to put it.
[3719.46 → 3721.16] There was no
[3721.16 → 3721.82] option for
[3721.82 → 3722.22] alternatives.
[3722.94 → 3723.92] Well, I mean,
[3723.92 → 3724.62] I even told
[3724.62 → 3725.30] I even told
[3725.30 → 3726.04] Taken this as
[3726.04 → 3726.46] part of the
[3726.46 → 3727.68] negotiation process.
[3727.84 → 3728.20] He's like,
[3728.20 → 3728.58] well, what's
[3728.58 → 3729.24] your job offer?
[3729.68 → 3730.20] And I'm like,
[3730.28 → 3730.84] look, I'm going
[3730.84 → 3731.38] to do that
[3731.38 → 3732.42] complete like
[3732.42 → 3734.32] thing where
[3734.32 → 3735.38] I make you
[3735.38 → 3735.86] pitch me.
[3736.16 → 3736.92] Yeah, you tell
[3736.92 → 3737.10] me.
[3737.12 → 3737.48] Yeah, you know
[3737.48 → 3738.70] how I always do
[3738.70 → 3738.86] that.
[3738.88 → 3739.50] I'm the worst,
[3739.58 → 3739.74] right?
[3740.04 → 3741.04] So you tell
[3741.04 → 3743.28] me and here's
[3743.28 → 3743.66] the thing.
[3744.14 → 3744.96] Either your pitch
[3744.96 → 3745.48] is going to make
[3745.48 → 3746.86] sense, and I'm
[3746.86 → 3747.44] going to say,
[3748.02 → 3749.72] yeah, you are
[3749.72 → 3750.98] able to see
[3750.98 → 3751.84] the big picture
[3751.84 → 3753.74] even considering
[3753.74 → 3754.66] your own personal
[3754.66 → 3755.98] gain and do
[3755.98 → 3756.88] something that is
[3756.88 → 3757.98] balanced and right
[3757.98 → 3758.54] for both the
[3758.54 → 3759.04] company and
[3759.04 → 3760.44] yourself or
[3760.44 → 3760.80] you're going to
[3760.80 → 3761.44] pitch me something
[3761.44 → 3763.20] that sucks and I
[3763.20 → 3763.76] probably shouldn't
[3763.76 → 3764.36] hire you anyway.
[3764.76 → 3765.36] Those are the only
[3765.36 → 3766.04] two outcomes.
[3766.54 → 3767.58] So no, this is
[3767.58 → 3768.48] this is actually
[3768.48 → 3769.38] your first test.
[3769.50 → 3769.74] Yeah.
[3769.86 → 3770.74] Is to tell me what
[3770.74 → 3771.24] your compensation
[3771.24 → 3772.16] package should be.
[3772.16 → 3772.68] And like why.
[3772.98 → 3773.54] And why.
[3773.76 → 3773.98] Yeah.
[3774.38 → 3774.94] Pitch it to me
[3774.94 → 3775.96] because your entire
[3775.96 → 3777.50] job is going to be
[3777.50 → 3779.04] pitching shareholder
[3779.04 → 3780.90] Linus on expenses
[3780.90 → 3782.94] and management
[3782.94 → 3784.52] and why what you're
[3784.52 → 3785.54] doing is in the best
[3785.54 → 3786.08] interests of the
[3786.08 → 3786.40] company.
[3787.06 → 3787.70] So prove it.
[3788.08 → 3788.90] And like obviously
[3788.90 → 3790.34] you know his
[3790.34 → 3790.98] response you
[3790.98 → 3792.26] you know guy
[3792.26 → 3793.86] right a little bit
[3793.86 → 3794.88] but also I think he
[3794.88 → 3795.42] understood where I
[3795.42 → 3795.98] was coming from
[3795.98 → 3796.54] because if we're
[3796.54 → 3797.28] going to have that
[3797.28 → 3798.56] level of trust and
[3798.56 → 3798.88] we're going to be
[3798.88 → 3799.46] able to communicate
[3799.46 → 3800.48] that openly it has
[3800.48 → 3801.08] to start from day
[3801.08 → 3801.32] one.
[3801.44 → 3803.18] It can't just
[3803.18 → 3804.06] be it can't just be
[3804.06 → 3804.36] random.
[3805.14 → 3807.58] And so the reason
[3807.58 → 3808.38] that I wasn't really
[3808.38 → 3810.48] that open to and
[3810.48 → 3811.46] I and I told him to
[3811.46 → 3812.78] as part of this
[3812.78 → 3814.24] very open communication
[3814.24 → 3815.64] I was like yeah I'm
[3815.64 → 3816.76] making you do this
[3816.76 → 3818.22] but the reality of it
[3818.22 → 3819.70] is I don't have any
[3819.70 → 3820.70] other candidates and
[3820.70 → 3821.50] I'm not really open
[3821.50 → 3821.88] to them.
[3822.54 → 3824.46] So you have me over a
[3824.46 → 3824.78] barrel.
[3826.16 → 3827.52] But let's see what you
[3827.52 → 3828.26] would do with that.
[3828.28 → 3828.56] Are you going to deal
[3828.56 → 3829.20] with this properly?
[3829.34 → 3829.44] Yeah.
[3829.66 → 3829.88] Yeah.
[3831.10 → 3832.42] And the reason that I
[3832.42 → 3833.88] wasn't really open to
[3833.88 → 3836.32] other options even
[3836.32 → 3837.38] though like obviously we
[3837.38 → 3838.48] could have posted a job
[3838.48 → 3838.88] listing.
[3839.44 → 3840.70] What I don't post on
[3840.70 → 3841.08] Indeed.
[3841.46 → 3842.34] You know I'm hiring a
[3842.34 → 3843.64] CEO for a media
[3843.64 → 3844.76] company, so I don't
[3844.76 → 3844.98] know.
[3846.76 → 3849.62] But that wouldn't have
[3849.62 → 3850.98] changed my day to day.
[3851.40 → 3852.12] I wouldn't have been
[3852.12 → 3853.12] able to let go.
[3853.72 → 3855.70] I would have had to I
[3855.70 → 3856.58] would have been looking
[3856.58 → 3858.32] over this CEO's shoulder
[3858.32 → 3859.50] because I don't know
[3859.50 → 3859.72] them.
[3859.82 → 3860.46] I don't have that
[3860.46 → 3860.96] relationship.
[3861.24 → 3862.50] And like I said earlier
[3862.50 → 3863.68] on the show I'm not
[3863.68 → 3866.24] I'm pretty antisocial.
[3866.36 → 3867.20] I don't want more
[3867.20 → 3867.68] friends.
[3868.04 → 3869.44] Like I joke a lot about
[3869.44 → 3870.50] how I have more I have
[3870.50 → 3871.08] no friends.
[3871.74 → 3872.86] But the reality of it
[3872.86 → 3873.46] is I actually don't
[3873.46 → 3875.26] I actually don't want
[3875.26 → 3875.56] them.
[3875.90 → 3876.66] I'm tired.
[3876.82 → 3877.28] I don't like talking
[3877.28 → 3877.72] to people.
[3878.32 → 3879.38] And so I would have
[3879.38 → 3881.46] to I have to like
[3881.46 → 3882.32] build a relationship
[3882.32 → 3883.38] with this person
[3883.38 → 3884.86] and like build this
[3884.86 → 3886.26] rapport and try to
[3886.26 → 3887.10] achieve this like
[3887.10 → 3888.10] mind meld.
[3888.14 → 3889.18] And it's so much
[3889.18 → 3890.76] easier to just hire
[3890.76 → 3891.86] someone who already
[3891.86 → 3893.16] is the person who
[3893.16 → 3895.78] trained me to be
[3895.78 → 3896.94] the business mind
[3896.94 → 3897.62] that I am
[3897.62 → 3899.38] as it were
[3899.38 → 3902.20] and so I know
[3902.20 → 3903.30] would make the
[3903.30 → 3904.16] decision that I would
[3904.16 → 3904.88] because the only reason
[3904.88 → 3905.90] I do what I do
[3905.90 → 3906.62] is because they told
[3906.62 → 3907.16] me to.
[3909.10 → 3910.36] I had a lot of people
[3910.36 → 3911.12] question
[3911.12 → 3913.40] you know why we
[3913.40 → 3914.26] didn't hire from within
[3914.26 → 3916.80] and it's a really
[3916.80 → 3917.50] good question.
[3917.70 → 3918.90] I think that there's
[3918.90 → 3919.64] a lot of potential
[3919.64 → 3922.24] for people to be
[3922.24 → 3923.86] upset both externally
[3923.86 → 3924.86] and internally.
[3925.26 → 3925.60] I'm pissed.
[3925.60 → 3927.10] We didn't even you
[3927.10 → 3927.60] know post.
[3928.06 → 3928.60] We didn't even give
[3928.60 → 3929.52] anyone an opportunity
[3929.52 → 3930.76] to apply for the job
[3930.76 → 3931.22] internally.
[3932.66 → 3934.26] But I mean this
[3934.26 → 3935.44] in the kindest
[3935.44 → 3936.48] possible way.
[3937.38 → 3938.36] Nobody internally
[3938.36 → 3939.30] was even close to
[3939.30 → 3939.76] qualified.
[3941.30 → 3941.82] Sorry.
[3942.50 → 3942.94] That just.
[3943.98 → 3944.76] I'm sorry.
[3944.94 → 3945.52] I don't think that's
[3945.52 → 3946.66] entirely those people's
[3946.66 → 3946.90] fault.
[3947.14 → 3948.08] No it's not.
[3948.40 → 3949.02] Just I know.
[3949.16 → 3950.76] I know you're not
[3950.76 → 3951.34] saying that.
[3951.54 → 3952.26] I'm saying that for the
[3952.26 → 3953.00] audience to be super
[3953.00 → 3953.18] clear.
[3953.20 → 3953.38] OK.
[3953.84 → 3954.72] Yeah but that's
[3954.72 → 3955.32] totally true.
[3955.32 → 3956.12] Like where has their
[3956.12 → 3956.80] mentorship been.
[3956.88 → 3957.98] We're a really young
[3957.98 → 3958.68] team too.
[3959.04 → 3959.30] Yes.
[3959.38 → 3960.80] Like we do not have
[3960.80 → 3961.16] people.
[3961.78 → 3963.10] I'm the adult in the
[3963.10 → 3963.40] room.
[3964.34 → 3965.58] What the fuck.
[3966.00 → 3967.18] And when we're talking
[3967.18 → 3968.26] about like these
[3968.26 → 3969.30] situations where like
[3969.30 → 3970.52] oh you don't
[3970.52 → 3971.38] necessarily realize you
[3971.38 → 3972.02] need to create a
[3972.02 → 3972.84] knowledge base article
[3972.84 → 3974.68] for something and then
[3974.68 → 3975.20] you don't necessarily
[3975.20 → 3976.08] have the time to do it
[3976.08 → 3976.96] afterwards and stuff
[3976.96 → 3977.80] like we're coming from
[3977.80 → 3978.44] that, and you're
[3978.44 → 3979.66] expecting this type of
[3979.66 → 3981.32] like it's just it
[3981.32 → 3982.04] hasn't been there.
[3982.50 → 3982.78] Yeah.
[3983.02 → 3983.58] It's tough.
[3983.58 → 3987.04] So we actually do
[3987.04 → 3988.30] post new positions
[3988.30 → 3989.46] internally under
[3989.46 → 3990.42] normal circumstances
[3990.42 → 3991.44] but this was a
[3991.44 → 3992.98] something that was
[3992.98 → 3994.10] you know kind of a
[3994.10 → 3995.44] private matter for me
[3995.44 → 3996.56] in a certain sense
[3996.56 → 3997.80] and be something
[3997.80 → 3999.02] that again like no
[3999.02 → 4000.00] offence to anyone
[4000.00 → 4001.36] that just weren't
[4001.36 → 4003.00] weren't right for the
[4003.00 → 4003.26] job.
[4003.40 → 4004.14] And I'd love
[4004.14 → 4004.94] Yeah.
[4006.06 → 4007.54] Jay Taylor said
[4007.54 → 4009.04] I only feel like Luke
[4009.04 → 4010.46] wouldn't want to be
[4010.46 → 4010.92] the CEO.
[4011.84 → 4013.40] I could see myself
[4013.40 → 4014.26] being interested
[4014.26 → 4016.08] potentially at some
[4016.08 → 4018.18] point not now for a
[4018.18 → 4019.12] multitude of reasons.
[4019.56 → 4021.08] One I feel like I have
[4021.08 → 4021.92] a lot of unfinished
[4021.92 → 4022.94] business with the teams
[4022.94 → 4023.86] that I currently run
[4023.86 → 4026.74] and by having that role
[4026.74 → 4027.94] change I would have to
[4027.94 → 4029.82] kind of like leave them
[4029.82 → 4030.70] which does not feel
[4030.70 → 4031.04] right.
[4031.44 → 4032.94] And two I'm not ready
[4032.94 → 4033.30] anyway.
[4033.42 → 4034.12] You have a lot to learn.
[4034.32 → 4034.46] Yeah.
[4034.46 → 4036.12] I mean it's its always
[4036.12 → 4037.22] hilarious for me
[4037.22 → 4038.54] when I hear my own
[4038.54 → 4039.56] words coming out of
[4039.56 → 4041.08] Luke's mouth talking
[4041.08 → 4042.50] about like some
[4042.50 → 4043.54] strategy that he used
[4043.54 → 4044.52] to talk to his team
[4044.52 → 4046.04] or like and like
[4046.04 → 4046.72] there's still a lot
[4046.72 → 4048.08] like I understand
[4048.08 → 4049.18] because I'm not stupid
[4049.18 → 4050.26] that there's a long
[4050.26 → 4051.94] road of that ahead of
[4051.94 → 4052.36] me still.
[4052.94 → 4054.44] So like and the
[4054.44 → 4056.70] thing is that I'm not
[4056.70 → 4057.90] really qualified to take
[4057.90 → 4058.64] you down that road.
[4058.86 → 4059.90] That's a big part of
[4059.90 → 4061.72] this too is I don't
[4061.72 → 4062.66] have that much real
[4062.66 → 4063.78] world work experience.
[4063.78 → 4065.10] Like think about
[4065.10 → 4065.26] that.
[4065.38 → 4066.72] We're like this is the
[4066.72 → 4067.92] one thing that like I
[4067.92 → 4069.94] guess I'm still I'll be
[4069.94 → 4070.92] uncomfortable about
[4070.92 → 4072.92] this for a while and
[4072.92 → 4073.62] that's just going to be
[4073.62 → 4075.58] a reality is Linus
[4075.58 → 4077.82] slash Yvonne which I'm
[4077.82 → 4079.40] considering one unit or
[4079.40 → 4080.22] person right now.
[4080.32 → 4081.02] That's how we see it.
[4081.12 → 4081.32] Yeah.
[4081.66 → 4082.80] So that's fine.
[4083.30 → 4084.80] Has been my direct
[4084.80 → 4086.42] report for 12 years
[4086.42 → 4088.94] effectively my entire
[4088.94 → 4090.68] realistically professional
[4090.68 → 4092.06] life because everything
[4092.06 → 4092.92] before then was like
[4092.92 → 4093.74] temporary jobs.
[4093.78 → 4094.50] If I'm being honest
[4094.50 → 4096.10] and I think that's
[4096.10 → 4096.98] that's going to be a
[4096.98 → 4098.60] big change, but I will
[4098.60 → 4100.04] also say now having
[4100.04 → 4101.10] spent time with Taryn
[4101.10 → 4102.96] I'm interested.
[4103.46 → 4103.62] Yeah.
[4104.22 → 4105.10] And Yvonne and I have
[4105.10 → 4106.18] a lot to we have a lot
[4106.18 → 4106.52] to give.
[4106.74 → 4107.58] We actually do have a
[4107.58 → 4108.12] lot to teach.
[4108.26 → 4109.50] She has management
[4109.50 → 4110.56] experience coming into
[4110.56 → 4110.88] this.
[4111.14 → 4112.28] I have experience coming
[4112.28 → 4113.56] into this, and we've
[4113.56 → 4115.78] both learned a ton.
[4116.34 → 4118.20] Just school of hard
[4118.20 → 4118.60] knocks.
[4118.82 → 4120.38] Let's go making our
[4120.38 → 4121.02] way through the last
[4121.02 → 4121.60] 10 years.
[4123.34 → 4124.60] But there's actually
[4124.60 → 4126.50] ways to do things
[4126.50 → 4128.04] that you don't just
[4128.04 → 4128.82] make up as you go
[4128.82 → 4129.74] along and see what
[4129.74 → 4130.08] sticks.
[4130.70 → 4131.86] That's a lot of my
[4131.86 → 4132.28] stuff too.
[4132.34 → 4133.98] So like I feel like I
[4133.98 → 4135.10] might end up having a
[4135.10 → 4136.76] lot of growth from
[4136.76 → 4137.04] this.
[4137.28 → 4137.48] Yeah.
[4137.68 → 4138.64] It's just going to be
[4138.64 → 4140.42] it's a complicated
[4140.42 → 4142.32] situation and I
[4142.32 → 4144.54] appreciate the fact
[4144.54 → 4145.06] that we did that
[4145.06 → 4146.16] executive retreat thing
[4146.16 → 4147.82] because that I had
[4147.82 → 4148.56] talked to him a few
[4148.56 → 4148.86] times.
[4149.02 → 4149.64] Obviously I met him at
[4149.64 → 4150.06] the roast.
[4150.22 → 4151.98] I had respect for him
[4151.98 → 4153.62] from like knowing him
[4153.62 → 4154.82] back in NCX days very
[4154.82 → 4155.18] lightly.
[4155.32 → 4155.90] I think I met him like
[4155.90 → 4157.28] twice and just having
[4157.28 → 4158.34] you talk about him
[4158.34 → 4159.00] meeting him at the
[4159.00 → 4159.60] roast all that kind of
[4159.60 → 4160.50] stuff but being able to
[4160.50 → 4162.14] spend an extended period
[4162.14 → 4163.26] of time of like two days
[4163.26 → 4164.20] or whatever but still
[4164.20 → 4166.86] was reassuring because
[4166.86 → 4168.54] the things that I care
[4168.54 → 4169.74] about in a person in
[4169.74 → 4171.02] this type of role is
[4171.02 → 4172.28] like I mean he's a
[4172.28 → 4172.92] human he's going to
[4172.92 → 4173.72] make mistakes at some
[4173.72 → 4174.68] point, but you could
[4174.68 → 4175.84] tell the way that he
[4175.84 → 4176.34] was approaching
[4176.34 → 4177.32] conversations and
[4177.32 → 4178.12] problems when we were
[4178.12 → 4179.04] at that retreat and
[4179.04 → 4179.72] he's probably watching
[4179.72 → 4180.90] this, so this is awkward
[4180.90 → 4182.70] but I could tell that
[4182.70 → 4184.92] in the case where he
[4184.92 → 4185.84] makes some form of
[4185.84 → 4186.76] mistake or someone
[4186.76 → 4188.10] else does that he
[4188.10 → 4189.44] seems significantly more
[4189.44 → 4191.22] invested in trying
[4191.22 → 4192.30] really hard and solving
[4192.30 → 4193.68] the problem than like
[4193.68 → 4194.88] crushing people or
[4194.88 → 4195.64] whatever else.
[4195.64 → 4197.84] he's very like
[4197.84 → 4198.74] game minded.
[4199.32 → 4199.42] Yep.
[4199.52 → 4200.36] Like let's let's get
[4200.36 → 4201.12] this done let's do it
[4201.12 → 4201.72] in the best way.
[4201.86 → 4202.48] And to be clear he'll
[4202.48 → 4202.96] tell you when you
[4202.96 → 4203.34] f*** up.
[4203.44 → 4204.32] Which is good.
[4204.52 → 4204.76] Yeah.
[4204.96 → 4205.74] Because I wouldn't
[4205.74 → 4206.60] work very well with
[4206.60 → 4207.52] him if he didn't so
[4207.52 → 4208.32] like that's fine.
[4209.48 → 4210.64] Yeah one of my one of
[4210.64 → 4212.44] my most vivid memories
[4212.44 → 4213.52] was when he told me
[4213.52 → 4216.84] off for like telling a
[4216.84 → 4217.98] vendor some kind of
[4217.98 → 4219.72] like super internal
[4219.72 → 4220.92] information just like in
[4220.92 → 4221.92] a casual conversation
[4221.92 → 4223.34] he's like you don't
[4223.34 → 4224.32] talk about that dude
[4224.32 → 4225.32] like it kind of ran me
[4225.32 → 4225.64] through.
[4227.40 → 4228.76] Terse is a word that
[4228.76 → 4230.00] I've used to describe
[4230.00 → 4230.64] Taken before.
[4231.00 → 4231.48] Hi Taken if you're
[4231.48 → 4231.76] watching.
[4232.76 → 4233.72] He's better about it
[4233.72 → 4234.56] now which is really
[4234.56 → 4234.80] good.
[4234.88 → 4235.92] He was younger and
[4235.92 → 4237.00] fierier than we all
[4237.00 → 4237.22] were.
[4237.44 → 4237.90] Makes sense.
[4238.06 → 4238.42] Yeah yeah.
[4238.90 → 4240.00] So it was definitely
[4240.00 → 4241.96] terse, but I understood
[4241.96 → 4244.02] it, and it was in the
[4244.02 → 4245.52] interest of the company
[4245.52 → 4246.74] doing better and me
[4246.74 → 4247.18] doing better.
[4247.46 → 4247.68] Yeah.
[4248.08 → 4249.02] And you gotta
[4249.02 → 4249.86] respect that right?
[4249.94 → 4250.12] Yeah.
[4250.70 → 4251.52] So I don't know.
[4251.52 → 4252.56] I've got a couple good
[4252.56 → 4253.42] questions here that I've
[4253.42 → 4254.06] seen in the chat.
[4254.06 → 4256.08] One is hey isn't that
[4256.08 → 4257.08] the guy who ran NCI
[4257.08 → 4257.74] into the ground?
[4257.82 → 4258.18] What are you doing
[4258.18 → 4258.70] hiring him?
[4259.54 → 4259.94] No.
[4260.08 → 4260.78] I've had that same
[4260.78 → 4261.20] comment.
[4261.54 → 4262.32] I've had to make the
[4262.32 → 4262.98] same clarification.
[4263.12 → 4263.40] Yeah.
[4264.32 → 4266.76] Taken was my boss but
[4266.76 → 4268.42] not the owner of NCI
[4268.42 → 4271.60] and actually Taken was a
[4271.60 → 4273.50] big part of if not the
[4273.50 → 4274.66] reason that I left.
[4275.54 → 4276.76] When they when what
[4276.76 → 4277.54] they should have what
[4277.54 → 4279.30] NCI should have done
[4279.30 → 4281.48] what man how long ago
[4281.48 → 4283.06] was it I guess about
[4283.06 → 4285.22] 12 years ago was they
[4285.22 → 4286.72] should have hired Taken
[4286.72 → 4289.06] to be not if not CEO
[4289.06 → 4291.38] COO and given him the
[4291.38 → 4292.18] reins to run it.
[4292.86 → 4294.14] That would have saved it
[4294.14 → 4295.18] 100 percent.
[4295.32 → 4296.72] I really do believe that
[4296.72 → 4297.66] in my heart of hearts.
[4298.18 → 4299.82] I had some ideas and all
[4299.82 → 4300.54] of that, but I was
[4300.54 → 4301.98] basically a kid at that
[4301.98 → 4303.24] point and I had good
[4303.24 → 4304.74] ideas like ways that
[4304.74 → 4305.46] we could do better.
[4305.46 → 4308.42] But I didn't like I
[4308.42 → 4309.40] wasn't an executive.
[4309.70 → 4310.74] I'm barely an executive
[4310.74 → 4311.26] now.
[4311.36 → 4312.50] I was certainly wasn't an
[4312.50 → 4313.22] executive then.
[4314.06 → 4315.24] He had the stuff.
[4315.42 → 4316.26] He could have figured it
[4316.26 → 4317.72] out and instead they
[4317.72 → 4319.14] pushed him out, and I was
[4319.14 → 4319.70] like well this is
[4319.70 → 4321.36] ridiculous because now
[4321.36 → 4323.00] we've got like the
[4323.00 → 4323.76] inmates running the
[4323.76 → 4324.96] asylum essentially around
[4324.96 → 4325.32] here.
[4325.72 → 4326.80] None of the adults are
[4326.80 → 4327.58] left in the room.
[4328.26 → 4329.08] It's time to start
[4329.08 → 4329.88] looking for the exit.
[4330.02 → 4330.88] Like it was very clear
[4330.88 → 4331.64] that the writing was on
[4331.64 → 4332.72] the wall as soon as
[4332.72 → 4335.42] they a didn't
[4335.42 → 4337.02] recognize that they
[4337.02 → 4337.92] were in trouble and
[4337.92 → 4340.16] b couldn't hire the
[4340.16 → 4341.26] solution that already
[4341.26 → 4342.24] worked for them.
[4343.40 → 4344.40] Oh wow.
[4344.70 → 4345.66] What is happening
[4345.66 → 4345.96] here?
[4347.58 → 4349.34] So no that is not
[4349.34 → 4349.80] what happened.
[4349.98 → 4350.48] And then another
[4350.48 → 4351.22] perfect question
[4351.22 → 4351.88] that's coming up a
[4351.88 → 4353.32] fair bit is why not
[4353.32 → 4354.26] Yvonne for CEO?
[4355.30 → 4356.26] Couple of reasons.
[4356.74 → 4359.16] One that ain't her
[4359.16 → 4359.60] jam.
[4359.84 → 4360.30] I was going to say
[4360.30 → 4360.88] she wouldn't want
[4360.88 → 4361.10] that.
[4361.76 → 4363.18] Yvonne if she were to
[4363.18 → 4364.30] change titles from
[4364.30 → 4365.40] CFO would be
[4365.40 → 4366.28] the chief operating
[4366.28 → 4366.70] officer.
[4366.86 → 4368.34] Yvonne has such a
[4368.34 → 4371.62] mind for optimization.
[4372.56 → 4374.10] She is just the queen
[4374.10 → 4374.80] of efficiency.
[4375.84 → 4376.96] And aside from that
[4376.96 → 4378.98] she really loves
[4378.98 → 4380.14] solving problems.
[4380.94 → 4381.94] And so operations
[4381.94 → 4382.66] would be something
[4382.66 → 4383.10] that she would
[4383.10 → 4384.18] totally just kick
[4384.18 → 4384.64] butt at.
[4385.72 → 4386.94] But the question is
[4386.94 → 4387.76] does she want the
[4387.76 → 4388.04] job?
[4388.46 → 4389.60] And as shareholder
[4389.60 → 4390.58] she basically gets to
[4390.58 → 4392.20] decide what job she
[4392.20 → 4393.68] does sort of but also
[4393.68 → 4394.94] doesn't because she's a
[4394.94 → 4396.66] shareholder and she
[4396.66 → 4397.40] just kind of needs to
[4397.40 → 4398.14] do whatever is right
[4398.14 → 4398.64] for the company.
[4398.72 → 4399.36] And both of us have
[4399.36 → 4400.04] done that for a long
[4400.04 → 4400.34] time.
[4400.80 → 4401.72] And so while my
[4401.72 → 4402.60] transition is really
[4402.60 → 4404.14] public she may go
[4404.14 → 4404.80] through a transition
[4404.80 → 4406.56] that will be probably
[4406.56 → 4407.78] less public but
[4407.78 → 4410.12] equally helpful for her.
[4410.24 → 4410.82] I think it's been a
[4410.82 → 4411.96] long time doing
[4411.96 → 4412.72] something that she
[4412.72 → 4414.60] has realistically no
[4414.60 → 4416.32] actual passion for
[4416.32 → 4417.62] which is like financial
[4417.62 → 4418.06] stuff.
[4419.16 → 4419.60] Good at it.
[4419.60 → 4420.92] Yeah well that's the
[4420.92 → 4421.50] thing she can be good
[4421.50 → 4421.94] at anything.
[4422.12 → 4422.98] She just needs to
[4422.98 → 4424.94] decide she's good at
[4424.94 → 4425.04] it.
[4425.12 → 4425.80] And it's like okay
[4425.80 → 4426.08] then.
[4427.08 → 4428.26] Like I can't do that.
[4428.34 → 4428.96] I don't have that
[4428.96 → 4429.28] power.
[4429.76 → 4431.30] Like I'm perfect at
[4431.30 → 4431.76] some stuff.
[4431.84 → 4432.78] Way better than her at
[4432.78 → 4433.26] some stuff.
[4433.66 → 4435.44] But she is way better
[4435.44 → 4436.40] than me at anything
[4436.40 → 4438.40] other than that like
[4438.40 → 4439.60] handful of stuff that
[4439.60 → 4440.38] I'm perfect at.
[4440.88 → 4442.70] It's kind of wild how
[4442.70 → 4443.68] she'll just like I mean
[4443.68 → 4444.46] look at that stupid
[4444.46 → 4445.54] short circuit video she
[4445.54 → 4446.12] did on the cricket.
[4446.12 → 4448.30] I gave her about 13
[4448.30 → 4449.30] minutes of training in
[4449.30 → 4450.06] the car on the way to
[4450.06 → 4451.34] work and kind of helped
[4451.34 → 4452.26] her put together like a
[4452.26 → 4453.48] skeleton for you know
[4453.48 → 4454.34] what a script might look
[4454.34 → 4455.00] like, and then she did
[4455.00 → 4455.50] the whole thing.
[4455.60 → 4456.50] It's got like 1.4
[4456.50 → 4457.18] million views or
[4457.18 → 4457.44] whatever.
[4457.58 → 4458.86] She has almost
[4458.86 → 4460.10] no on-camera experience.
[4460.40 → 4461.16] Her total on-camera
[4461.16 → 4462.08] experience is like maybe
[4462.08 → 4462.88] a couple of hours.
[4463.30 → 4464.04] And like doesn't really
[4464.04 → 4464.96] like it as far as my
[4464.96 → 4465.60] understanding goes.
[4465.72 → 4466.30] She doesn't mind it.
[4466.46 → 4466.70] Okay.
[4466.86 → 4468.08] She doesn't like coming
[4468.08 → 4468.48] on WAN.
[4468.60 → 4469.36] She gets kind of
[4469.36 → 4470.32] self-conscious about it
[4470.32 → 4471.16] sometimes I think but
[4471.16 → 4472.84] it's just like I don't
[4472.84 → 4474.02] know I tend to be kind
[4474.02 → 4474.90] of dismissive about it.
[4474.92 → 4475.38] I'm like whatever.
[4476.12 → 4476.70] You're like you're good
[4476.70 → 4477.62] at anything so what do
[4477.62 → 4479.46] you like don't I don't
[4479.46 → 4480.10] even want to hear it.
[4480.36 → 4481.54] You know it's like oh I
[4481.54 → 4482.56] got such a bad mark.
[4482.66 → 4483.70] It's like that's like way
[4483.70 → 4484.52] higher than my mark.
[4485.64 → 4486.44] It's typical.
[4488.10 → 4489.06] Didn't you fail out?
[4489.14 → 4489.70] I don't know how much
[4489.70 → 4490.26] that means.
[4494.46 → 4494.82] Um.
[4496.62 → 4497.18] Anywho.
[4497.20 → 4497.94] Should we move on?
[4498.04 → 4498.32] Yeah.
[4498.44 → 4499.94] We need to talk about a
[4499.94 → 4502.22] big LTT store thing here.
[4502.44 → 4502.82] Ah.
[4502.82 → 4504.04] Yeah yeah.
[4504.48 → 4505.02] Yeah yeah.
[4505.20 → 4506.10] Check this out.
[4506.46 → 4507.08] Check this out.
[4507.16 → 4507.32] Now.
[4507.70 → 4508.54] Oh yeah.
[4508.66 → 4509.06] Hold on.
[4509.18 → 4509.26] Okay.
[4509.48 → 4510.42] For the sake of the
[4510.42 → 4511.62] integrity of our poll
[4511.62 → 4514.22] neither you nor I
[4514.22 → 4515.70] is going to
[4515.70 → 4516.84] is going to
[4516.84 → 4517.74] give any feedback
[4517.74 → 4518.54] on this one.
[4518.62 → 4519.24] We'll see if the poll
[4519.24 → 4519.52] works.
[4519.98 → 4520.48] Oh what?
[4520.60 → 4521.36] Are polls broken?
[4521.70 → 4522.44] Uh yeah that might be.
[4522.64 → 4523.22] Oh crap.
[4523.50 → 4524.48] We know how to fix them.
[4524.48 → 4525.16] I don't remember.
[4525.30 → 4525.92] I don't think they're
[4525.92 → 4526.32] fixed though.
[4526.46 → 4526.86] Oh okay.
[4526.96 → 4527.48] We were a little bit
[4527.48 → 4528.18] more focused on
[4528.18 → 4529.72] the massive update.
[4529.78 → 4529.94] Okay.
[4530.04 → 4530.64] Do you want to try
[4530.64 → 4531.70] to create a poll?
[4532.00 → 4533.74] I mean I can.
[4534.02 → 4535.20] The poll is just
[4535.20 → 4536.08] option one,
[4536.16 → 4536.62] option two,
[4536.70 → 4537.32] option three.
[4538.08 → 4539.16] Uh let's just
[4539.16 → 4540.16] okay yeah sure.
[4540.60 → 4541.64] Okay go for it.
[4543.98 → 4545.02] Good luck everybody.
[4546.68 → 4548.26] We are finally ready
[4548.26 → 4548.66] to.
[4548.66 → 4549.62] What is the question?
[4549.76 → 4550.36] What one do you want?
[4550.50 → 4550.94] Uh yeah.
[4551.04 → 4552.32] Which one is best?
[4552.32 → 4555.44] Okay.
[4556.14 → 4556.84] Did it work?
[4558.16 → 4558.56] Yes.
[4558.88 → 4559.88] Well okay that's not
[4559.88 → 4560.82] the part that's going
[4560.82 → 4561.20] to have a.
[4561.56 → 4562.10] Oh okay.
[4562.32 → 4563.72] It's the speed at
[4563.72 → 4565.42] which people are
[4565.42 → 4565.72] voting.
[4565.98 → 4566.40] Oh okay.
[4566.40 → 4566.78] And we know how to
[4566.78 → 4567.10] fix it.
[4567.24 → 4567.88] It's like not hard.
[4568.08 → 4568.48] Vote slowly.
[4568.48 → 4569.04] But we never had time.
[4570.58 → 4570.94] What?
[4571.70 → 4572.56] I'm not surprised.
[4572.82 → 4573.70] Guys don't do that.
[4574.04 → 4574.16] That.
[4574.72 → 4575.60] What are you doing?
[4575.74 → 4576.60] There's not that many
[4576.60 → 4576.94] votes.
[4577.22 → 4577.62] Okay.
[4577.98 → 4578.96] Well let's not worry
[4578.96 → 4579.66] about that then.
[4580.14 → 4580.42] Okay.
[4580.70 → 4581.06] Let's just.
[4581.06 → 4581.54] Yeah but there's a lot
[4581.54 → 4582.04] more people than that.
[4582.04 → 4582.46] There's a lot of
[4582.46 → 4583.12] people watching on
[4583.12 → 4583.68] float plane these
[4583.68 → 4583.88] days.
[4584.48 → 4584.90] Okay.
[4586.08 → 4586.80] We're finally
[4586.80 → 4587.46] announcing it.
[4587.70 → 4588.82] The Noctua edition
[4588.82 → 4589.74] of the LTT
[4589.74 → 4591.22] screwdriver in
[4591.22 → 4592.02] tannin brown.
[4592.66 → 4594.08] This is option one.
[4594.78 → 4596.28] This is option two.
[4597.18 → 4598.14] And this is option
[4598.14 → 4598.76] three.
[4600.08 → 4600.50] Okay.
[4600.58 → 4601.28] I don't want to.
[4601.28 → 4601.76] I don't want to
[4601.76 → 4602.66] bias you guys.
[4603.46 → 4603.86] And.
[4604.02 → 4604.50] And.
[4604.90 → 4605.32] Luke.
[4605.84 → 4607.02] I actually have a
[4607.02 → 4607.60] couple of the
[4607.60 → 4608.06] options.
[4609.34 → 4610.10] Here in the
[4610.10 → 4610.44] studio.
[4610.54 → 4611.16] Here in the
[4611.16 → 4612.36] studio in person.
[4612.36 → 4613.28] You can check it
[4613.28 → 4613.76] out.
[4614.16 → 4614.40] Yeah.
[4614.52 → 4614.96] Very.
[4616.28 → 4616.76] Very.
[4617.08 → 4618.24] Very excited for
[4618.24 → 4618.48] this.
[4618.56 → 4619.68] This is going to be
[4619.68 → 4621.34] freaking awesome.
[4621.86 → 4622.62] I mean it means a
[4622.62 → 4623.46] lot to me to
[4623.46 → 4624.30] collaborate with a
[4624.30 → 4625.26] company like Noctua.
[4625.38 → 4625.92] You know how their
[4625.92 → 4626.62] standards are.
[4626.72 → 4627.54] If they're willing to.
[4627.78 → 4629.10] If they're willing to
[4629.10 → 4630.34] cross.
[4630.46 → 4631.66] Cross promote and
[4631.66 → 4632.62] participate in
[4632.62 → 4633.42] something like this.
[4633.94 → 4635.02] You know they got to
[4635.02 → 4636.00] absolutely love the
[4636.00 → 4636.44] screwdriver.
[4636.44 → 4636.52] screwdriver.
[4637.12 → 4638.78] So have a look.
[4639.06 → 4640.26] Don't really give a
[4640.26 → 4641.08] ton of thoughts yet.
[4641.18 → 4641.66] Dan do you want to
[4641.66 → 4642.38] man the camera and we
[4642.38 → 4643.14] can kind of show these
[4643.14 → 4643.86] ones off after.
[4645.16 → 4646.00] I need to send a
[4646.00 → 4646.34] message.
[4647.16 → 4647.34] Oh.
[4647.88 → 4648.16] Okay.
[4648.58 → 4649.18] Screw it.
[4649.26 → 4649.38] Yeah.
[4649.44 → 4649.62] Okay.
[4653.22 → 4653.62] Okay.
[4653.62 → 4654.16] He's.
[4654.36 → 4655.80] I took it on the
[4655.80 → 4656.14] ground.
[4658.28 → 4658.88] All right.
[4663.20 → 4663.56] Wow.
[4665.56 → 4666.60] I'm just going to go
[4666.60 → 4666.78] ahead.
[4666.88 → 4667.38] I'm going to I'm
[4667.38 → 4668.50] going to not show the
[4668.50 → 4669.00] results here.
[4669.00 → 4669.48] I'm going to go back
[4669.48 → 4669.92] to this.
[4670.44 → 4670.98] All right.
[4671.06 → 4671.90] So Luke do you want
[4671.90 → 4672.68] to kind of show what
[4672.68 → 4673.24] you got there.
[4673.72 → 4673.90] Yeah.
[4674.04 → 4675.68] So both of these.
[4678.62 → 4680.50] So again guys option
[4680.50 → 4682.24] one option two option
[4682.24 → 4682.78] three.
[4683.62 → 4687.28] I'm trying to find
[4687.28 → 4687.40] that.
[4687.52 → 4687.70] Okay.
[4687.80 → 4689.80] So this one is the
[4689.80 → 4690.54] unique one.
[4690.60 → 4691.20] Is that correct?
[4691.64 → 4693.08] The unique one
[4693.08 → 4694.78] because there's I
[4694.78 → 4696.00] believe this one has
[4696.00 → 4698.20] the same colour as I
[4698.20 → 4698.72] don't remember the
[4698.72 → 4699.56] name for the selector
[4699.56 → 4701.42] ring and the whatever
[4701.42 → 4702.12] you call this.
[4703.48 → 4705.34] I mean I'm not sure
[4705.34 → 4706.24] what you mean by most
[4706.24 → 4706.90] unique one.
[4707.10 → 4707.92] That's called the end
[4707.92 → 4708.36] cap though.
[4708.52 → 4708.74] Okay.
[4708.80 → 4709.64] So end cap selector
[4709.64 → 4710.82] ring same colour handle
[4710.82 → 4711.46] same colour.
[4711.88 → 4712.40] And this one has
[4712.40 → 4714.40] accent ring is I
[4714.40 → 4714.74] believe.
[4714.84 → 4715.52] Is that in there?
[4715.58 → 4716.18] Yeah that's in there.
[4716.24 → 4717.16] It's matched to the
[4717.16 → 4717.68] body colour.
[4718.00 → 4718.38] Oh okay.
[4718.38 → 4718.72] So the handle colour.
[4718.74 → 4719.08] So I was going to
[4719.08 → 4720.00] say this is the same
[4720.00 → 4720.84] but inverse as the
[4720.84 → 4721.48] other one and then
[4721.48 → 4722.30] this one doesn't have
[4722.30 → 4722.66] an inverse.
[4722.78 → 4723.20] Is that correct?
[4723.46 → 4724.66] Yeah that one follows
[4724.66 → 4726.14] the same kind of colour
[4726.14 → 4728.04] scheme as the like the
[4728.04 → 4728.98] orange one would with
[4728.98 → 4730.22] the accent on the end
[4730.22 → 4731.12] cap and the accent on
[4731.12 → 4731.72] the accent ring.
[4733.18 → 4733.98] Don't give an
[4733.98 → 4734.92] opinion yet because I
[4734.92 → 4736.86] want I actually need you
[4736.86 → 4738.12] know true results here.
[4738.12 → 4743.84] Okay well um wow.
[4744.76 → 4745.24] What?
[4745.56 → 4746.72] Just we're going to have
[4746.72 → 4747.52] to close the poll at
[4747.52 → 4748.70] some point, and I was
[4748.70 → 4750.46] expecting it to be not
[4750.46 → 4751.02] this close.
[4751.34 → 4753.12] Okay don't spam in
[4753.12 → 4754.18] chat guys relax.
[4754.46 → 4756.96] Yeah guys chat does not
[4756.96 → 4758.08] is not where the
[4758.08 → 4758.74] polling happens.
[4758.86 → 4759.86] The polling happens in
[4759.86 → 4760.14] the poll.
[4760.36 → 4760.50] The poll.
[4760.74 → 4762.02] Yeah we're not looking
[4762.02 → 4762.48] at chat.
[4762.96 → 4764.04] What are the option
[4764.04 → 4764.74] numbers again?
[4764.98 → 4765.96] One two and three.
[4765.96 → 4766.48] Okay.
[4767.04 → 4767.70] You're welcome.
[4768.84 → 4770.36] I will show you again.
[4771.88 → 4773.04] Okay so one.
[4773.38 → 4774.16] This one is one.
[4774.36 → 4774.90] Two and three.
[4774.90 → 4775.86] This one is two and
[4775.86 → 4776.60] then the pictured one
[4776.60 → 4777.04] is three.
[4777.76 → 4778.82] No, no no, no no.
[4778.84 → 4779.48] No you're holding
[4779.48 → 4780.64] three in your left hand.
[4780.74 → 4781.58] Yeah and then this is
[4781.58 → 4782.92] two and so on I don't
[4782.92 → 4783.20] have.
[4783.46 → 4783.56] Yeah.
[4783.60 → 4783.80] Yeah.
[4784.10 → 4784.80] Yeah one you don't
[4784.80 → 4785.08] have.
[4786.70 → 4787.10] Okay.
[4787.54 → 4787.94] Okay.
[4788.06 → 4788.90] I'm going to close the
[4788.90 → 4789.42] poll now.
[4790.82 → 4791.82] We are closing the
[4791.82 → 4794.94] polls and let's see
[4794.94 → 4795.10] our.
[4796.16 → 4796.60] Yes.
[4797.12 → 4797.48] Yeah.
[4797.52 → 4798.30] See that's the part.
[4798.62 → 4798.98] Okay.
[4799.08 → 4799.82] Well let's show the
[4799.82 → 4800.48] results then.
[4801.64 → 4802.56] Option one.
[4803.02 → 4803.44] Whoa wait.
[4804.26 → 4805.14] Oh it just changed.
[4806.50 → 4807.44] Option one and
[4807.44 → 4809.44] option three are a
[4809.44 → 4810.18] dead heat.
[4810.74 → 4812.40] 586 to 586.
[4813.98 → 4814.42] Okay.
[4814.56 → 4815.30] I don't know how to
[4815.30 → 4815.64] deal with.
[4815.72 → 4815.86] Okay.
[4815.90 → 4816.64] It's finished now.
[4817.92 → 4818.84] Holy crap.
[4819.66 → 4820.10] Yeah.
[4820.36 → 4821.22] It's finished for you.
[4821.22 → 4824.40] I have never seen any
[4824.40 → 4826.04] poll this close for
[4826.04 → 4827.08] anything we've ever
[4827.08 → 4827.46] done.
[4828.50 → 4831.72] Option one but by
[4831.72 → 4832.96] only two votes.
[4834.00 → 4837.08] Literally 0.3% of the
[4837.08 → 4837.38] vote.
[4840.50 → 4841.10] Okay.
[4842.20 → 4843.52] Do we need to do a
[4843.52 → 4844.26] runoff then?
[4845.26 → 4845.70] We can.
[4846.40 → 4847.54] Does it happen to be
[4847.54 → 4848.00] that.
[4848.00 → 4849.36] Okay.
[4849.50 → 4849.62] No.
[4849.90 → 4850.64] You know what.
[4852.28 → 4853.42] I think this you know
[4853.42 → 4854.30] I think this is enough
[4854.30 → 4855.42] information for us to go
[4855.42 → 4857.16] back to knock to and kind
[4857.16 → 4858.28] of figure this out then
[4858.28 → 4859.86] either way.
[4859.96 → 4860.24] Okay.
[4860.28 → 4861.12] What do you think now?
[4863.70 → 4864.48] Do you want me to show
[4864.48 → 4865.02] you all three again?
[4865.68 → 4865.90] Yeah.
[4866.34 → 4866.58] Okay.
[4867.08 → 4869.48] I will say I don't feel
[4869.48 → 4871.02] like super strongly about
[4871.02 → 4871.22] it.
[4871.22 → 4871.74] Really?
[4871.94 → 4872.66] I think they're all
[4872.66 → 4873.36] pretty cool.
[4874.06 → 4877.62] I think this one so
[4877.62 → 4878.30] option two.
[4878.64 → 4878.96] Yeah.
[4879.38 → 4882.00] And option not this one
[4882.00 → 4883.24] are probably my favourite
[4883.24 → 4884.90] option two and one I think
[4884.90 → 4886.16] it is are my two favourite.
[4886.32 → 4886.64] Got it.
[4887.54 → 4888.02] Yeah.
[4888.02 → 4889.12] You know what's funny is I
[4889.12 → 4890.18] think this is one that I
[4890.18 → 4893.24] just completely didn't nail.
[4894.66 → 4895.80] I liked this one.
[4895.96 → 4897.22] I like yeah I like that one
[4897.22 → 4898.64] or option one
[4898.64 → 4898.74] personally.
[4898.74 → 4902.86] I do have a do you
[4902.86 → 4904.24] think it's not white but
[4904.24 → 4905.12] do you think that colour
[4905.12 → 4905.50] would.
[4906.66 → 4908.26] It might show it might
[4908.26 → 4908.94] show stuff.
[4909.16 → 4910.00] I just thought it looked
[4910.00 → 4910.62] way cooler.
[4912.38 → 4914.02] But people are more into
[4914.02 → 4915.24] the're more into the
[4915.24 → 4916.50] brown body on it.
[4917.70 → 4918.14] Yeah.
[4918.20 → 4919.18] Like all right.
[4919.34 → 4919.78] Okay.
[4919.92 → 4921.44] And you know what I think
[4921.44 → 4922.84] I just I think I just lost
[4922.84 → 4924.32] a think I just lost a bet
[4924.32 → 4925.94] because knock to objected
[4925.94 → 4927.24] pretty strongly to this one.
[4927.44 → 4928.72] Is that is that the
[4928.72 → 4929.58] one that I didn't I wasn't
[4929.58 → 4930.64] really watching the results
[4930.64 → 4930.84] much.
[4930.94 → 4931.80] Is that the one that this
[4931.80 → 4933.44] one lost this one lost
[4933.44 → 4935.56] lost and the other two
[4935.56 → 4937.80] basically tied were
[4937.80 → 4939.94] functionally even.
[4940.28 → 4940.54] Yeah.
[4941.68 → 4944.40] So I guess we'll see we'll
[4944.40 → 4945.16] have to work it out with
[4945.16 → 4946.46] knock to a which version
[4946.46 → 4946.78] of this.
[4946.98 → 4947.40] People are saying there
[4947.40 → 4948.50] was a thousand votes before
[4948.50 → 4949.58] we even showed the options.
[4949.88 → 4951.00] Do you want to rerun the
[4951.00 → 4951.22] poll?
[4951.52 → 4952.44] Do you want to rerun the
[4952.44 → 4953.42] poll with just two options?
[4953.76 → 4954.74] No I'm not too worried
[4954.74 → 4956.06] about it because when I
[4956.06 → 4957.40] looked earlier on before I
[4957.40 → 4958.40] actually showed the options
[4958.40 → 4960.56] the poll was fairly even
[4960.56 → 4961.98] and two was actually
[4961.98 → 4962.28] winning.
[4962.44 → 4962.84] I think so.
[4963.00 → 4964.26] And then it kind of
[4964.26 → 4964.70] inverted.
[4965.12 → 4966.26] So if people threw
[4966.26 → 4967.00] away their vote they
[4967.00 → 4968.06] threw away their vote but
[4968.06 → 4969.30] like that's that's voting
[4969.30 → 4969.78] for you.
[4970.08 → 4970.24] Yeah.
[4970.84 → 4972.26] It's kind of part of the
[4972.26 → 4972.66] system.
[4974.86 → 4976.54] Eventually like when we
[4976.54 → 4977.44] can work on things that
[4977.44 → 4978.54] aren't incredibly important
[4978.54 → 4979.58] I do want to have ranked
[4979.58 → 4980.24] choice voting.
[4980.96 → 4981.10] Yeah.
[4981.10 → 4982.06] I think that would be sick.
[4982.22 → 4982.42] Yeah.
[4982.48 → 4983.12] It'd be super cool.
[4983.22 → 4984.08] But not now.
[4984.72 → 4985.16] All right.
[4985.16 → 4986.40] So there you go guys.
[4986.76 → 4989.10] The Noctua screwdriver is
[4989.10 → 4990.22] officially announced.
[4990.42 → 4991.28] We are working with
[4991.28 → 4993.14] Noctua on what exactly the
[4993.14 → 4994.10] colour scheme will be.
[4994.26 → 4995.76] That's the detail that
[4995.76 → 4996.82] we're kind of going back
[4996.82 → 4997.38] and forth on.
[4997.46 → 4997.58] Yeah.
[4997.58 → 4998.40] It's not like actually
[4998.40 → 4999.24] viewer's choice like
[4999.24 → 5000.08] Noctua needs to have
[5000.08 → 5001.08] input and all this other
[5001.08 → 5001.44] kind of stuff.
[5001.46 → 5002.16] They do need to have
[5002.16 → 5002.52] input.
[5002.92 → 5003.98] I mean worst case
[5003.98 → 5005.24] scenario we just do a
[5005.24 → 5006.10] brown and tan screwdriver
[5006.10 → 5007.92] and they're not involved
[5007.92 → 5008.26] I guess.
[5008.26 → 5008.74] Yeah.
[5008.74 → 5010.74] I mean that's
[5010.74 → 5011.70] Oops.
[5013.78 → 5014.18] What?
[5015.70 → 5015.96] Oh.
[5017.10 → 5017.80] I was going to say
[5017.80 → 5018.40] that's what we're doing
[5018.40 → 5019.36] for some other stuff.
[5019.64 → 5019.82] Oh.
[5020.98 → 5021.90] Don't worry about it.
[5026.62 → 5027.80] I wonder how the new
[5027.80 → 5028.80] CEO is going to treat
[5028.80 → 5029.48] leaks.
[5030.04 → 5030.36] Yeah.
[5033.16 → 5034.12] Well he won't be the
[5034.12 → 5035.26] first person to yell at me
[5035.26 → 5036.22] about the way that I just
[5036.22 → 5037.54] talk about stuff on
[5037.54 → 5037.96] WAN show.
[5038.30 → 5039.30] Let's do a couple more
[5039.30 → 5039.76] topics.
[5039.86 → 5040.40] You want to pick one?
[5041.26 → 5041.66] Sure.
[5043.22 → 5044.04] Schools are struggling
[5044.04 → 5045.42] with AI as the academic
[5045.42 → 5046.32] year ends.
[5046.54 → 5047.08] Yeah they are.
[5047.10 → 5047.64] American schools are
[5047.64 → 5048.90] approaching the end of a
[5048.90 → 5049.86] full semester with
[5049.86 → 5051.16] widespread access to AI
[5051.16 → 5052.80] chatbots and AI enabled
[5052.80 → 5054.08] cheating has been
[5054.08 → 5055.40] predictably rampant.
[5055.46 → 5056.62] Especially now because a
[5056.62 → 5057.90] lot of schooling, a lot
[5057.90 → 5059.08] of your grades are kind of
[5059.08 → 5060.48] like end of term or
[5060.48 → 5061.80] semester weighted.
[5062.66 → 5064.12] So it's going to be a
[5064.12 → 5064.64] bigger problem now.
[5064.64 → 5065.44] One big project, you
[5065.44 → 5065.58] know?
[5065.70 → 5065.92] Yeah.
[5065.96 → 5067.00] One big project, one big
[5067.00 → 5067.38] final.
[5067.54 → 5068.10] Stuff like that.
[5068.52 → 5069.80] It's unclear to what
[5069.80 → 5071.16] degree this is an actual
[5071.16 → 5072.26] increase in academic
[5072.26 → 5073.98] dishonesty because like
[5073.98 → 5075.60] are more people cheating
[5075.60 → 5077.02] or is it just more
[5077.02 → 5078.06] rampant for the people
[5078.06 → 5078.82] that are cheating?
[5079.04 → 5080.08] Or is it making a bigger
[5080.08 → 5081.10] impact or something like
[5081.10 → 5081.34] that?
[5083.90 → 5085.16] Chegg, a tutoring
[5085.16 → 5086.20] service widely
[5086.20 → 5087.30] criticized for allowing
[5087.30 → 5088.32] students to buy the
[5088.32 → 5089.48] answers to homework and
[5089.48 → 5091.08] also tests, has told
[5091.08 → 5093.12] investors that ChatGPT
[5093.12 → 5094.58] has likely damaged their
[5094.58 → 5095.74] ability to attract new
[5095.74 → 5096.28] customers.
[5096.28 → 5097.82] The company has since
[5097.82 → 5100.58] lost $1 billion in
[5100.58 → 5101.30] market valuation.
[5101.44 → 5102.16] This happened a while
[5102.16 → 5102.40] ago.
[5102.56 → 5105.06] Isn't it wild that like a
[5105.06 → 5107.04] test cheating company is
[5107.04 → 5108.78] worth any billion dollars?
[5108.78 → 5108.98] Yeah.
[5108.98 → 5109.90] Like the fact that they
[5109.90 → 5111.10] could lose that much is
[5111.10 → 5111.86] like, whoa, okay.
[5112.66 → 5113.20] Kind of nuts.
[5114.00 → 5114.80] Complicating matters.
[5114.84 → 5115.74] How can students, no,
[5115.86 → 5116.70] seriously, no, no.
[5116.72 → 5117.42] I want to come back to
[5117.42 → 5117.94] this for a second.
[5118.10 → 5119.34] How can students with the
[5119.34 → 5120.26] tuition they're paying
[5120.26 → 5123.26] afford cheating, afford
[5123.26 → 5124.32] answer sheets?
[5125.04 → 5127.32] Or wait, how can they
[5127.32 → 5128.56] afford not to cheat?
[5128.92 → 5129.56] Yeah, it might be more.
[5129.56 → 5130.46] They can't repeat this
[5130.46 → 5130.82] course.
[5131.04 → 5131.80] And it might be more
[5131.80 → 5133.08] time effective, like if
[5133.08 → 5134.18] you just don't study but
[5134.18 → 5134.74] go to work.
[5134.90 → 5135.24] Right.
[5135.58 → 5135.90] Okay.
[5136.00 → 5136.24] All right.
[5136.28 → 5136.58] Fair enough.
[5137.22 → 5137.72] I get it now.
[5137.88 → 5138.68] Complicating matters,
[5138.86 → 5139.96] plagiarism, and AI
[5139.96 → 5141.38] detectors are imperfect,
[5141.38 → 5142.88] and the growing number of
[5142.88 → 5144.10] different AI models has
[5144.10 → 5145.16] dramatically increased the
[5145.16 → 5145.80] number of false
[5145.80 → 5147.28] positives and also
[5147.28 → 5147.74] negatives.
[5148.20 → 5148.80] Less technically
[5148.80 → 5150.22] sophisticated educators are
[5150.22 → 5151.44] prone to accepting these
[5151.44 → 5152.88] results at face value,
[5153.20 → 5154.62] including, is this right?
[5154.76 → 5155.10] Yes.
[5155.20 → 5155.44] Okay.
[5155.58 → 5156.32] I'm happy this is in the
[5156.32 → 5156.52] doc.
[5156.92 → 5158.68] Infamously, a Texas college
[5158.68 → 5160.74] professor recently accused
[5160.74 → 5163.40] all of his students of
[5163.40 → 5164.58] using, I thought it was
[5164.58 → 5166.44] like half, but anyway, of
[5166.44 → 5167.92] using ChatGPT to write
[5167.92 → 5169.18] their essays, leading to
[5169.18 → 5170.50] over half of them being
[5170.50 → 5172.32] held back from graduation.
[5172.86 → 5174.26] The professor had not used
[5174.26 → 5175.44] an AI detection tool.
[5175.74 → 5177.72] Instead, he ran the essay
[5177.72 → 5179.50] through ChatGPT, which
[5179.50 → 5180.92] claimed it had written
[5180.92 → 5181.20] them.
[5181.44 → 5189.02] Because it is just like, it
[5189.02 → 5189.94] was just like, oh, that
[5189.94 → 5190.56] seems neat.
[5190.64 → 5191.10] Yeah, sure.
[5191.20 → 5191.58] Right on.
[5191.72 → 5193.32] Like, sure.
[5193.44 → 5195.38] I did that.
[5195.38 → 5197.64] While a 100% AI generated
[5197.64 → 5199.16] essay is clearly cheating,
[5199.36 → 5200.74] and I'm going to paraphrase
[5200.74 → 5201.16] here for a second.
[5201.76 → 5202.72] We've seen a bunch of
[5202.72 → 5203.60] examples of this, of
[5203.60 → 5205.34] teachers showing like
[5205.34 → 5206.70] halfway through an essay.
[5206.84 → 5207.92] It'll be like, now I'm not
[5207.92 → 5209.26] entirely certain about this
[5209.26 → 5210.58] because I am an AI generated
[5210.58 → 5211.44] model, blah, blah, blah,
[5211.44 → 5211.72] blah, blah, blah.
[5212.04 → 5212.98] And they catch people with
[5212.98 → 5213.76] that, which is kind of
[5213.76 → 5214.20] hilarious.
[5215.08 → 5216.16] They don't even read it.
[5216.24 → 5216.88] That's awesome.
[5217.12 → 5217.38] Okay.
[5217.64 → 5217.96] Brutal.
[5218.30 → 5220.10] While a 100% AI generated
[5220.10 → 5221.12] essay is clearly cheating,
[5221.34 → 5223.20] more nuanced uses of AI,
[5223.42 → 5225.12] like using a chatbot to help
[5225.12 → 5227.04] generate ideas and reword
[5227.04 → 5229.02] awkward sentences, can and
[5229.02 → 5230.88] sometimes do get flagged by
[5230.88 → 5231.90] anti-cheating software.
[5231.90 → 5233.68] The same may happen if a
[5233.68 → 5235.34] student simply writes in a
[5235.34 → 5236.60] highly predictable manner,
[5237.28 → 5238.60] reminiscent of AI.
[5239.86 → 5241.10] Yes, Bruce A., I'm still
[5241.10 → 5241.70] happy with it.
[5242.96 → 5243.84] Don't worry about it.
[5243.92 → 5244.36] Sounds good.
[5245.06 → 5245.92] There's a discussion
[5245.92 → 5246.32] question.
[5246.44 → 5247.18] Should schools be
[5247.18 → 5248.64] responding to AI?
[5250.12 → 5252.26] Also, why do porn bots still
[5252.26 → 5253.48] no good at the talk?
[5254.50 → 5254.98] Yeah.
[5255.16 → 5255.58] Okay.
[5256.80 → 5257.98] Have you noticed this?
[5258.04 → 5258.78] Have you been on YouTube
[5258.78 → 5259.14] lately?
[5259.44 → 5260.22] Yeah, you see them in the
[5260.22 → 5260.80] comment section.
[5260.80 → 5263.24] No, you can't see anything
[5263.24 → 5265.32] but, pun intended, them.
[5266.18 → 5268.12] Like, honestly, it's at the
[5268.12 → 5270.76] point now where, again, I am
[5270.76 → 5272.58] asking you once again, YouTube,
[5273.58 → 5274.82] do something.
[5275.38 → 5277.88] Like, if a handful of people
[5277.88 → 5279.84] that just have asses in their
[5279.84 → 5281.46] profile pictures but are real
[5281.46 → 5283.02] people end up getting shadow
[5283.02 → 5285.54] banned, that's a price I'm
[5285.54 → 5286.66] willing to pay at this point
[5286.66 → 5288.80] because we cannot just have...
[5288.80 → 5292.70] I sent my YouTube rep just, like,
[5292.74 → 5294.50] a screen recording of scrolling
[5294.50 → 5295.66] through the comments on one of
[5295.66 → 5298.46] our videos and literally 90% of
[5298.46 → 5300.20] the top comments within, like, an
[5300.20 → 5301.48] hour after it had been released
[5301.48 → 5304.36] were these, like, come have, tap to
[5304.36 → 5306.60] have sex with me, like, porn bots.
[5307.02 → 5308.56] And I'm sitting here going, these are,
[5308.68 → 5311.02] these are very easy to identify.
[5311.02 → 5313.02] I haven't seen any of the WhatsApp
[5313.02 → 5313.98] scammers anymore.
[5314.46 → 5315.54] No, they've shifted.
[5315.80 → 5318.00] So, clearly, YouTube has the
[5318.00 → 5321.24] capability to ban every possible
[5321.24 → 5324.28] iteration of WhatsApp from usernames.
[5324.46 → 5326.20] So, do the same thing.
[5326.98 → 5331.08] Why does anyone need a luscious ass
[5331.08 → 5332.58] in their profile picture?
[5332.58 → 5335.54] It's not necessary.
[5336.72 → 5340.26] What if they're a hot tub YouTuber?
[5340.76 → 5342.12] What if that's literally part of
[5342.12 → 5342.52] their brand?
[5343.16 → 5344.02] Then they'll be verified.
[5344.42 → 5344.94] There, done.
[5345.18 → 5345.48] Okay.
[5346.46 → 5346.98] Or they can...
[5346.98 → 5347.58] What if they're on the...
[5348.34 → 5350.24] Or they can apply for an exception.
[5350.44 → 5350.98] I don't care.
[5351.08 → 5351.18] Yeah.
[5351.24 → 5351.86] Figure it out.
[5352.60 → 5353.54] Figure it out.
[5353.56 → 5354.42] There should be a way to apply for it.
[5354.44 → 5356.20] And figuring it out needs to involve
[5356.20 → 5357.86] just getting rid of this.
[5358.06 → 5359.54] If you have to overcorrect,
[5360.06 → 5360.90] overcorrect.
[5360.90 → 5361.96] It's ridiculous.
[5362.80 → 5363.74] Why do you have to...
[5363.74 → 5367.00] Why do you have to use the word luscious?
[5368.66 → 5369.72] I thought it was good.
[5369.80 → 5370.28] I thought it was funny.
[5371.10 → 5371.68] And like...
[5371.68 → 5371.88] Yeah.
[5372.06 → 5373.00] It's bad, though.
[5373.24 → 5374.08] And they...
[5374.08 → 5375.58] Sometimes, I will say,
[5376.22 → 5377.22] they...
[5377.22 → 5378.60] And this should potentially
[5378.60 → 5379.86] even be easier to detect,
[5379.98 → 5381.06] but I guess there'd be a lot of
[5381.06 → 5382.18] false positives here as well.
[5382.50 → 5384.42] But they'll copy other people's
[5384.42 → 5386.60] comments and just post the same thing.
[5387.18 → 5387.46] Yeah.
[5387.46 → 5387.56] Yeah.
[5387.56 → 5388.46] I've seen that a lot.
[5388.56 → 5389.08] That's pretty common.
[5389.34 → 5389.50] Yep.
[5389.50 → 5390.94] Yeah.
[5391.02 → 5391.60] It's super frustrating.
[5391.60 → 5393.62] But to me, the biggest thing is just like...
[5393.62 → 5395.00] And I understand this is easier to do
[5395.00 → 5397.14] with human eyes and comprehension,
[5397.32 → 5398.44] but we'll see how long that lasts.
[5399.52 → 5400.62] You scroll through,
[5400.72 → 5402.00] and you see the usernames.
[5402.28 → 5402.72] And it's just like...
[5402.72 → 5403.46] It's just obvious.
[5403.46 → 5404.36] This is so obvious.
[5404.88 → 5405.78] And like how...
[5405.78 → 5407.34] The fact that it will take
[5407.34 → 5409.10] many months to like
[5409.10 → 5410.30] pattern detect this stuff
[5410.30 → 5411.04] is just like, what?
[5411.16 → 5412.14] Like the WhatsApp ones.
[5412.32 → 5413.60] Like, come on.
[5413.60 → 5417.32] Didn't Theo Joe make something for that?
[5417.42 → 5417.60] Yeah.
[5417.60 → 5418.08] The WhatsApp one?
[5418.20 → 5418.40] Yeah.
[5418.40 → 5419.96] That worked better than YouTube's.
[5419.96 → 5421.98] This shouldn't take community efforts
[5421.98 → 5423.52] to solve this stuff.
[5424.20 → 5425.70] Like, man, I don't know.
[5425.78 → 5427.28] And it's frustrating because like,
[5427.34 → 5428.12] on the one hand,
[5428.16 → 5429.46] you've got Google doing,
[5429.60 → 5429.84] you know,
[5429.94 → 5431.18] their Google I.O. keynote
[5431.18 → 5433.08] all about AI this
[5433.08 → 5434.54] and machine learning that.
[5434.76 → 5435.22] Use it.
[5435.88 → 5436.32] Yeah.
[5436.62 → 5437.42] Turn it on.
[5437.50 → 5437.78] Yeah.
[5437.78 → 5439.94] Why can I still...
[5439.94 → 5440.92] Like this is why...
[5440.92 → 5442.04] This is why you don't...
[5442.04 → 5443.22] Call Hoffman Wong.
[5446.08 → 5446.56] Sorry.
[5446.78 → 5447.58] Who do you want to call?
[5449.06 → 5450.12] Hoffman Wong.
[5451.44 → 5451.92] Sorry.
[5452.12 → 5453.16] I'm not finding a match
[5453.16 → 5453.94] in your contacts.
[5454.46 → 5455.72] Tell me just the first name
[5455.72 → 5457.36] or feel free to use the screen.
[5458.76 → 5460.96] Feel free to use the f***ING screen.
[5461.24 → 5462.56] That's not a solution.
[5466.42 → 5467.64] This is the same...
[5467.64 → 5468.62] I've been ragging on Google
[5468.62 → 5469.24] for a while
[5469.24 → 5471.06] for like...
[5471.06 → 5472.28] It's literally...
[5472.28 → 5472.56] Yeah.
[5473.24 → 5474.18] It's literally...
[5474.18 → 5475.18] It's just Hoffman Wong.
[5476.12 → 5477.66] It's not like he nicknamed it
[5477.66 → 5478.44] or anything like that.
[5478.52 → 5478.80] It's just...
[5478.80 → 5480.36] Hoffman has two N's in his name.
[5480.36 → 5480.62] Exactly that.
[5480.94 → 5482.32] Which is a legitimate spelling
[5482.32 → 5482.92] of Hoffman.
[5483.06 → 5483.28] Yeah.
[5484.04 → 5485.22] And it's like...
[5485.22 → 5486.38] I don't know.
[5486.48 → 5487.40] I can't do this.
[5489.88 → 5490.56] I'm sorry.
[5490.66 → 5491.48] I don't have a number
[5491.48 → 5492.64] for Yvonne Hold.
[5493.18 → 5493.74] I understand.
[5493.94 → 5494.74] You absolutely shouldn't
[5494.74 → 5495.38] have to do this.
[5495.42 → 5496.50] So I'm not using it to...
[5496.50 → 5497.02] I'm not saying this
[5497.02 → 5497.62] to defend it.
[5497.88 → 5498.94] One thing I've done...
[5498.94 → 5500.32] Call James Strive.
[5503.40 → 5503.80] Sorry.
[5504.02 → 5504.82] Who do you want to call?
[5506.32 → 5507.44] James Strive.
[5509.44 → 5509.80] Sorry.
[5510.22 → 5511.38] No one in your contacts.
[5511.48 → 5511.78] Sorry.
[5511.96 → 5513.00] I'm not finding a match
[5513.00 → 5513.76] in your contacts.
[5514.28 → 5515.56] Tell me just the first name
[5515.56 → 5517.16] or feel free to use the screen.
[5518.16 → 5519.12] Feel free to use the screen.
[5519.12 → 5519.86] How about this?
[5519.86 → 5521.18] How about I only have
[5521.18 → 5522.28] one f***ING James
[5522.28 → 5523.16] in my address book?
[5523.42 → 5524.34] Call that one.
[5527.16 → 5528.60] I nickname...
[5528.60 → 5529.66] I put people's...
[5529.66 → 5531.32] Like an identifiable nickname
[5531.32 → 5532.16] that I will remember
[5532.16 → 5533.54] as people's first names.
[5534.06 → 5535.70] And then their...
[5535.70 → 5537.24] First name is their middle name
[5537.24 → 5537.80] and their last name
[5537.80 → 5538.42] is their last name.
[5538.50 → 5539.70] That's a stupid workaround
[5539.70 → 5540.50] that I shouldn't need.
[5540.74 → 5541.08] I agree.
[5541.08 → 5542.98] The year is now present year
[5542.98 → 5544.52] and that should be
[5544.52 → 5545.76] entirely unnecessary.
[5546.12 → 5546.36] Absolutely.
[5546.60 → 5548.08] It should have phonetic
[5548.08 → 5549.52] whatever cached
[5549.52 → 5551.08] of everyone in my address book
[5551.08 → 5552.46] and it should just use that.
[5552.68 → 5552.86] Yep.
[5553.00 → 5553.56] Because
[5553.56 → 5555.68] holy s***
[5555.68 → 5557.36] how is it not already doing that?
[5557.56 → 5557.80] Yep.
[5558.68 → 5559.14] And so
[5559.14 → 5560.54] I don't even remember
[5560.54 → 5561.04] the other thing
[5561.04 → 5561.90] we were talking about
[5561.90 → 5563.92] that they were useless at.
[5563.92 → 5565.86] I was just saying
[5565.86 → 5566.56] like in general
[5566.56 → 5568.02] like the fact that they haven't
[5568.02 → 5569.88] applied this stuff
[5569.88 → 5571.16] to deal with comment moderation.
[5571.22 → 5571.48] Oh yeah.
[5571.60 → 5572.38] Comment moderation.
[5572.54 → 5573.06] That was the one.
[5573.22 → 5574.44] That like whole core concept
[5574.44 → 5575.84] the fact that they haven't done that
[5575.84 → 5578.10] you can extrapolate that
[5578.10 → 5578.94] into entirely
[5578.94 → 5580.12] why they're losing ground
[5580.12 → 5581.54] on like everything that they do.
[5581.66 → 5581.80] Yep.
[5582.88 → 5583.48] They're just
[5583.48 → 5584.44] they're just not
[5584.44 → 5585.20] shipping.
[5585.38 → 5586.50] They're not acting.
[5586.76 → 5587.68] They're just sitting.
[5588.26 → 5589.02] It doesn't work.
[5589.52 → 5590.32] It's frustrating.
[5590.48 → 5591.00] People are going to come
[5591.00 → 5591.62] steal your lunch.
[5591.62 → 5594.66] Anyway
[5594.66 → 5595.40] moving on.
[5596.54 → 5596.84] Imgur?
[5597.36 → 5597.78] Imgur?
[5598.50 → 5599.02] Imgur?
[5599.16 → 5599.38] I think?
[5599.60 → 5599.96] Imgur?
[5600.76 → 5601.28] Imgur?
[5601.72 → 5602.20] If?
[5602.36 → 5602.60] GIF?
[5602.86 → 5604.50] I feel like it's one of those things.
[5604.76 → 5605.30] Last month
[5605.30 → 5606.70] however you say it
[5606.70 → 5607.48] announced a ban
[5607.48 → 5608.18] on nudity
[5608.18 → 5609.78] and sexual explicit content
[5609.78 → 5610.64] as well as
[5610.64 → 5611.76] old, unused
[5611.76 → 5613.00] or inactive content
[5613.00 → 5614.06] that is not tied
[5614.06 → 5615.00] to a user account.
[5615.38 → 5616.24] Also known as
[5616.24 → 5616.66] a bunch of things
[5616.66 → 5617.14] from Linus.
[5617.52 → 5618.72] The changes took place
[5618.72 → 5619.76] on May 15th.
[5619.94 → 5620.32] One time.
[5620.32 → 5622.28] It was not one time.
[5622.52 → 5623.64] It was not one time.
[5623.84 → 5624.68] Three times.
[5624.86 → 5625.76] Maybe more accurate.
[5625.78 → 5627.74] I used to use Share
[5627.74 → 5628.78] or what was the one
[5628.78 → 5629.66] I used before that?
[5629.74 → 5631.00] It was a similar tool.
[5631.24 → 5632.08] Push I think it was called.
[5632.10 → 5632.38] Yeah, Push.
[5632.46 → 5632.70] Push.
[5632.70 → 5633.02] Push.
[5633.02 → 5633.44] Super cool.
[5633.52 → 5634.86] Anyway, Share was the one
[5634.86 → 5635.72] where I started uploading
[5635.72 → 5636.70] to Imgur I think
[5636.70 → 5638.62] but I used to use Share
[5638.62 → 5640.18] to just anonymously upload
[5640.18 → 5641.66] anything that I would screenshot
[5641.66 → 5643.18] only if I screenshotted it
[5643.18 → 5644.22] with Share
[5644.22 → 5644.88] like explicitly.
[5644.88 → 5647.10] and then I would just get
[5647.10 → 5648.18] it would just automatically
[5648.18 → 5649.88] take the link
[5649.88 → 5651.00] to the file you copied
[5651.00 → 5652.44] and put it on your clipboard
[5652.44 → 5653.06] so you could just
[5653.06 → 5654.34] quickly send things to people
[5654.34 → 5657.18] and one time
[5657.18 → 5658.24] I send Luke
[5658.24 → 5659.50] confidential information
[5659.50 → 5661.08] in an image thing
[5661.08 → 5662.92] and he like freaks out.
[5663.00 → 5663.26] I'm like
[5663.26 → 5664.50] without the context
[5664.50 → 5665.58] no one's even going to know
[5665.58 → 5666.62] how important that is.
[5666.74 → 5667.30] It doesn't matter.
[5667.82 → 5668.72] It shouldn't work that way.
[5668.86 → 5669.92] It shouldn't work that way.
[5669.92 → 5671.60] Anyway, so anything
[5671.60 → 5672.76] that someone like me
[5672.76 → 5673.50] ever uploaded
[5673.50 → 5674.34] yes, carry on.
[5674.72 → 5675.42] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5676.16 → 5678.40] The changes of this stuff
[5678.40 → 5679.62] took place on May 15th
[5679.62 → 5680.52] but it will likely take
[5680.52 → 5681.28] some time before
[5681.28 → 5682.50] all the images are deleted.
[5682.96 → 5683.86] The purge of old
[5683.86 → 5684.78] and anonymous content
[5684.78 → 5685.92] is likely to destroy
[5685.92 → 5687.16] countless images
[5687.16 → 5688.44] embedded on other sites
[5688.44 → 5689.40] across the internet
[5689.40 → 5690.30] including Reddit
[5690.30 → 5691.56] where hosting on Imgur
[5691.56 → 5693.50] was the standard method
[5693.50 → 5694.18] of posting images
[5694.18 → 5695.26] from 2009 to 2016.
[5695.40 → 5695.84] That is true.
[5696.04 → 5696.90] Another thing it's probably
[5696.90 → 5698.72] going to ravage
[5698.72 → 5700.60] is the count to 10,000 thread
[5700.60 → 5701.78] in the bronze section
[5701.78 → 5702.54] on the forum
[5702.54 → 5703.48] which is sad.
[5703.58 → 5704.16] Oh, yeah.
[5704.24 → 5705.42] Because there are tons of
[5705.42 → 5707.40] Imgur embedded images there.
[5707.78 → 5708.50] Yeah, that's a bummer.
[5708.58 → 5709.50] That actually kind of sucks
[5709.50 → 5710.82] because it's kind of funny
[5710.82 → 5711.14] to go through.
[5711.14 → 5712.92] Yeah, broken image links
[5712.92 → 5714.32] in forums and stuff.
[5714.66 → 5715.00] Photo bucket.
[5715.64 → 5716.82] You see just like
[5716.82 → 5718.42] the skeletons
[5718.42 → 5719.68] of old photo bucket
[5719.68 → 5720.30] and it's like man
[5720.30 → 5720.80] this would have been
[5720.80 → 5722.02] a really cool thing
[5722.02 → 5722.88] to actually be able
[5722.88 → 5723.38] to go through and read.
[5723.38 → 5724.50] It's almost like
[5724.50 → 5725.64] this isn't a viable
[5725.64 → 5726.56] business model
[5726.56 → 5728.44] and you're an idiot
[5728.44 → 5729.20] for doing it.
[5730.02 → 5731.00] Thanks, VCs.
[5731.60 → 5732.68] When they take big money
[5732.68 → 5734.10] from ad providers
[5734.10 → 5735.36] to put malvertising ads
[5735.36 → 5735.84] on their site
[5735.84 → 5736.40] which they've done
[5736.40 → 5737.76] like a bunch of times
[5737.76 → 5738.32] at this point
[5738.32 → 5739.42] maybe they do make
[5739.42 → 5739.78] some money
[5739.78 → 5740.44] but I don't know.
[5740.82 → 5741.66] They do show
[5741.66 → 5742.74] like if you see
[5742.74 → 5743.56] some picture
[5743.56 → 5744.22] or GIF or whatever
[5744.22 → 5744.98] there's a way
[5744.98 → 5746.44] on Imgur
[5746.44 → 5748.32] to see how much
[5748.32 → 5749.78] like how much data
[5749.78 → 5750.42] it has taken
[5750.42 → 5751.66] to serve this image
[5751.66 → 5752.46] and some of them
[5752.46 → 5753.80] are like whoa.
[5754.72 → 5755.36] Like it's a GIF
[5755.36 → 5756.14] that's been like
[5756.14 → 5758.40] hundreds and hundreds
[5758.40 → 5759.48] and hundreds of gigs
[5759.48 → 5760.76] worth of data transfer
[5760.76 → 5761.82] for this one GIF.
[5762.66 → 5763.14] Like yep
[5763.14 → 5764.28] that's rough.
[5764.98 → 5765.92] The administrators
[5765.92 → 5767.62] of Something Awful Forum
[5767.62 → 5768.76] have taken on
[5768.76 → 5770.02] a more selective effort
[5770.02 → 5770.68] to back up
[5770.68 → 5772.00] every Imgur link
[5772.00 → 5773.38] embedded onto the forum
[5773.38 → 5775.50] during the last 14 years.
[5775.70 → 5776.18] Wow.
[5776.44 → 5776.80] The forums
[5776.80 → 5777.78] I don't think
[5777.78 → 5778.42] we're going to do that.
[5778.78 → 5779.22] Yep.
[5779.40 → 5779.84] Shoddy not.
[5780.22 → 5781.28] The forum's owner
[5781.28 → 5782.52] who goes by Jeffrey
[5782.52 → 5784.54] has stated
[5784.54 → 5785.76] it's clear we need
[5785.76 → 5786.80] to host our own images.
[5786.98 → 5787.78] Websites promising
[5787.78 → 5788.46] that they'll host
[5788.46 → 5789.34] your images for free
[5789.34 → 5790.16] are never going to
[5790.16 → 5791.06] stop running out of money.
[5792.14 → 5793.36] It's nearly impossible
[5793.36 → 5794.18] to monetize
[5794.18 → 5795.06] a site like that.
[5795.38 → 5796.10] A good deal
[5796.10 → 5797.02] of the modern internet
[5797.02 → 5798.78] is treated as transient
[5798.78 → 5800.66] and okay to delete whenever
[5800.66 → 5802.14] and that is a real shame.
[5802.42 → 5803.68] If anyone is to ever
[5803.68 → 5804.96] look back on our society
[5804.96 → 5805.78] they won't be able
[5805.78 → 5806.60] to understand it
[5806.60 → 5807.62] without understanding
[5807.62 → 5808.20] the internet.
[5811.02 → 5811.68] That's going to be
[5811.68 → 5812.10] true regardless.
[5812.10 → 5812.96] Notably the
[5812.96 → 5813.78] Something Awful forum
[5813.78 → 5815.02] has paid membership
[5815.02 → 5816.24] and more resources
[5816.24 → 5817.36] than many other websites.
[5817.52 → 5818.22] That makes sense.
[5818.74 → 5819.48] How do we retain
[5819.48 → 5820.66] the popular history
[5820.66 → 5821.82] of the internet?
[5822.02 → 5822.86] Are we doing enough?
[5823.04 → 5823.76] I don't think we can.
[5824.00 → 5824.94] Maybe some of it
[5824.94 → 5826.06] should just die.
[5826.72 → 5827.20] Interesting.
[5827.38 → 5828.40] Well that's a hot take.
[5828.94 → 5829.44] Wow.
[5830.50 → 5831.46] Do go on.
[5831.72 → 5833.14] I don't think
[5833.14 → 5834.64] that everything
[5834.64 → 5836.14] no matter what
[5836.14 → 5837.64] is worth saving.
[5838.08 → 5839.02] I do think
[5839.02 → 5841.54] a massive volume
[5841.54 → 5842.00] of stuff
[5842.00 → 5842.78] is worth saving.
[5843.32 → 5844.28] A huge percentage.
[5845.28 → 5846.20] But there is
[5846.20 → 5847.00] a bunch of like
[5847.00 → 5848.08] just transient stuff
[5848.08 → 5848.44] on the internet
[5848.44 → 5849.30] that does not need
[5849.30 → 5850.16] to be safe.
[5850.26 → 5851.02] We don't have to save
[5851.02 → 5852.62] every single thing
[5852.62 → 5853.64] that ever happens
[5853.64 → 5854.42] in the digital world.
[5854.42 → 5855.58] But are we going to
[5855.58 → 5856.32] lose the stuff
[5856.32 → 5857.04] that was important
[5857.04 → 5858.26] and end up keeping garbage?
[5858.62 → 5859.00] That's
[5859.00 → 5860.34] that's a concern.
[5861.14 → 5861.62] Yeah.
[5862.28 → 5863.68] That's a big concern.
[5863.78 → 5864.60] That is a big concern.
[5864.60 → 5865.60] Oh.
[5868.48 → 5869.20] That's rough.
[5870.84 → 5871.24] Yeah.
[5871.42 → 5871.94] It's hard to say
[5871.94 → 5872.68] because like we were
[5872.68 → 5873.20] like we were talking
[5873.20 → 5874.24] about those photo bucket
[5874.24 → 5874.84] links right?
[5874.98 → 5875.26] Yeah.
[5875.38 → 5875.98] Like there's
[5875.98 → 5877.34] there are old threads
[5877.34 → 5878.76] which like
[5878.76 → 5880.00] it actually
[5880.00 → 5881.88] has pained me
[5881.88 → 5882.76] to come across them
[5882.76 → 5883.18] and be like
[5883.18 → 5883.52] man
[5883.52 → 5885.48] like this was a big deal.
[5885.82 → 5886.84] I've probably been
[5886.84 → 5887.36] to this thread
[5887.36 → 5888.62] like a ton of times.
[5888.72 → 5888.88] Yeah.
[5888.94 → 5889.90] And now these photos
[5889.90 → 5890.68] just timed out
[5890.68 → 5893.02] and this is basically useless.
[5893.18 → 5893.84] And now that we don't
[5893.84 → 5894.76] actually write anything
[5894.76 → 5895.54] down physically
[5895.54 → 5896.26] you know
[5896.26 → 5897.02] let's say you were
[5897.02 → 5897.84] trying to do
[5897.84 → 5898.52] let's say you were
[5898.52 → 5899.46] trying to overclock
[5899.46 → 5900.88] an old Cameron 300A
[5900.88 → 5903.44] and all the images
[5903.44 → 5905.32] for which pins to jump
[5905.32 → 5906.30] or on the motherboard
[5906.30 → 5906.88] or whatever
[5906.88 → 5908.12] were on photo bucket
[5908.12 → 5908.52] or whatever.
[5908.52 → 5909.74] Or a non-account
[5909.74 → 5911.36] imager say
[5911.36 → 5911.76] right?
[5911.84 → 5912.24] Because that would be
[5912.24 → 5912.84] happening now.
[5913.40 → 5914.46] You'd lose that.
[5914.62 → 5915.54] That's brutal.
[5915.66 → 5916.04] Like there is
[5916.04 → 5916.96] I'm not saying
[5916.96 → 5917.66] there isn't stuff
[5917.66 → 5918.36] that's worth saving.
[5918.42 → 5919.08] There's obviously
[5919.08 → 5920.04] oceans of stuff
[5920.04 → 5920.72] that's worth saving.
[5921.02 → 5922.42] There's also a lot of
[5922.42 → 5922.52] junk.
[5922.52 → 5923.64] But like repair
[5923.64 → 5925.10] repair guides and stuff
[5925.10 → 5926.18] didn't use to be video.
[5926.70 → 5927.28] And there might be
[5927.28 → 5927.84] like you're talking
[5927.84 → 5928.56] with the old Cameron
[5928.56 → 5929.62] there might be
[5929.62 → 5930.70] old repair guides
[5930.70 → 5931.58] that like
[5931.58 → 5932.56] it's for something
[5932.56 → 5933.86] that very rarely breaks.
[5934.38 → 5934.58] Yeah.
[5934.68 → 5936.06] But you can't get new ones.
[5936.20 → 5936.66] Or for something
[5936.66 → 5937.28] that's rare
[5937.28 → 5938.40] and very few people
[5938.40 → 5939.38] know how to deal with it
[5939.38 → 5939.94] and there was that
[5939.94 → 5940.72] one resource
[5940.72 → 5941.92] that everyone leaned on
[5941.92 → 5942.54] in order to
[5942.54 → 5944.24] calibrate that CRT
[5944.24 → 5945.58] or whatever it is right?
[5945.68 → 5946.44] Because for every
[5946.44 → 5948.26] for every forum thread
[5948.26 → 5949.04] that you find
[5949.04 → 5950.02] when digging for
[5950.02 → 5950.68] something old
[5950.68 → 5951.78] where someone's like
[5951.78 → 5953.50] oh I'm having issues
[5953.50 → 5954.26] with these things
[5954.26 → 5955.66] and then no one responds
[5955.66 → 5956.32] and they just reply
[5956.32 → 5957.24] oh I fixed it
[5957.24 → 5957.72] and it's like
[5957.72 → 5958.24] oh man
[5958.24 → 5959.72] why don't you tell me how?
[5960.42 → 5961.70] There's a bunch
[5961.70 → 5962.46] of other ones
[5962.46 → 5963.60] where they do
[5963.60 → 5965.60] and losing that
[5965.60 → 5966.46] because a ton of that
[5966.46 → 5967.62] information is in pictures
[5967.62 → 5968.56] you're talking about
[5968.56 → 5970.40] like bios screenshots
[5970.40 → 5971.22] whatever else
[5971.22 → 5971.60] it could be
[5971.60 → 5973.16] there are lots of pictures
[5973.16 → 5974.20] on the internet
[5974.20 → 5974.78] there are tons
[5974.78 → 5976.06] there are tons of useful ones.
[5976.06 → 5977.40] Thank God
[5977.40 → 5978.02] we're still going to have
[5978.02 → 5978.32] TikTok
[5978.32 → 5982.06] as long as we don't
[5982.06 → 5982.86] live in Minnesota
[5982.86 → 5983.90] or whichever state
[5983.90 → 5985.52] bandit or something.
[5985.94 → 5986.34] Happy Wag
[5986.34 → 5986.88] said this would be
[5986.88 → 5987.36] a good reason
[5987.36 → 5988.22] to fund libraries.
[5988.38 → 5989.10] Well there is
[5989.10 → 5990.94] so I do agree
[5990.94 → 5991.50] and there
[5991.50 → 5992.64] libraries are one
[5992.64 → 5993.58] of the libraries
[5993.58 → 5994.44] libraries
[5994.44 → 5995.68] are one of those things
[5995.68 → 5996.18] that are just
[5996.18 → 5998.00] kind of constantly changing
[5998.00 → 6000.34] constantly evolving
[6000.34 → 6001.70] and this might be
[6001.70 → 6002.66] one of the ways
[6002.66 → 6003.82] that they do that.
[6003.82 → 6004.56] Yeah unfortunately
[6004.56 → 6005.52] the way they're evolving
[6005.52 → 6006.06] right now
[6006.06 → 6007.08] is not getting funded
[6007.08 → 6008.68] so that's probably
[6008.68 → 6009.44] not going to happen.
[6009.80 → 6009.86] Yep.
[6010.28 → 6010.68] Altern
[6010.68 → 6012.20] in float plane chat
[6012.20 → 6013.68] sorry Montana
[6013.68 → 6014.16] is that right?
[6014.26 → 6014.48] I don't know
[6014.48 → 6015.00] it was someone
[6015.00 → 6016.66] Altern says
[6016.66 → 6017.42] convert the moon
[6017.42 → 6018.76] into a huge cloud server
[6018.76 → 6020.30] the zero atmosphere
[6020.30 → 6021.12] would be excellent
[6021.12 → 6021.66] for cooling
[6021.66 → 6022.28] and there'd be plenty
[6022.28 → 6023.36] of room for all that data
[6023.36 → 6024.44] problem solved.
[6024.84 → 6026.02] Okay there are a few issues
[6026.02 → 6026.90] with your suggestion.
[6027.72 → 6028.68] Number one
[6028.68 → 6030.52] okay getting servers
[6030.52 → 6031.50] there very challenging
[6031.50 → 6032.52] the moon is actually
[6032.52 → 6033.34] above the cloud
[6033.34 → 6036.74] number two
[6036.74 → 6037.96] zero atmosphere
[6037.96 → 6038.82] is actually
[6038.82 → 6040.40] not good for cooling.
[6042.72 → 6044.78] The air is what
[6044.78 → 6046.08] takes the heat away.
[6047.42 → 6048.86] Problem number three
[6048.86 → 6050.02] plenty of room
[6050.02 → 6050.54] actually
[6050.54 → 6051.56] you're right
[6051.56 → 6052.86] there is plenty of room
[6052.86 → 6053.28] on the moon.
[6053.28 → 6053.62] There's a lot of room
[6053.62 → 6054.16] yep
[6054.16 → 6056.20] if you don't mind
[6056.20 → 6057.18] your server
[6057.18 → 6058.38] getting hit by like
[6058.38 → 6059.86] little asteroids and stuff.
[6059.96 → 6061.34] Yeah so solid effort
[6061.34 → 6061.86] Altern
[6061.86 → 6064.32] and well not just that
[6064.32 → 6064.54] right
[6064.54 → 6065.48] without an atmosphere
[6065.48 → 6066.16] there's a lot more
[6066.16 → 6067.06] radiation from the sun.
[6067.24 → 6068.38] Which is really
[6068.38 → 6069.10] really handy
[6069.10 → 6070.06] if you don't like
[6070.06 → 6071.26] having your data.
[6071.70 → 6072.00] Yeah.
[6072.80 → 6073.90] Because that radiation
[6073.90 → 6074.64] is just going to start
[6074.64 → 6075.34] flipping bits
[6075.34 → 6076.28] all over the place.
[6076.64 → 6077.84] Yeah so what we could do
[6077.84 → 6078.38] I guess
[6078.38 → 6078.98] is
[6078.98 → 6080.86] build a moon base.
[6080.86 → 6081.48] Yeah no, no
[6081.48 → 6082.28] well it would have to be
[6082.28 → 6083.36] a mobile data centre.
[6083.86 → 6084.52] It would have to be
[6084.52 → 6085.82] on like treads
[6085.82 → 6086.92] so that it could stay
[6086.92 → 6087.96] like on the dark side.
[6088.32 → 6088.88] Oh there's still
[6088.88 → 6089.90] there's still a lot of
[6089.90 → 6091.18] just like passive radiation.
[6091.18 → 6094.02] It's not a real solution Luke.
[6094.28 → 6095.84] No, no no we're doing this.
[6095.96 → 6096.96] We put train tracks
[6096.96 → 6097.42] on the moon
[6097.42 → 6098.64] and it just constantly
[6098.64 → 6101.44] it just constantly rotates.
[6101.58 → 6103.24] We snow piercer the servers.
[6106.54 → 6106.98] Amazing.
[6107.96 → 6108.90] Okay float plane chat
[6108.90 → 6109.80] actually has this solved.
[6109.90 → 6110.56] We just put it underground
[6110.56 → 6111.02] on the moon.
[6111.88 → 6112.18] Oh.
[6112.58 → 6113.46] All right good call.
[6113.64 → 6114.12] Good call.
[6114.20 → 6114.50] Perfect.
[6114.58 → 6114.90] Good call.
[6115.02 → 6115.58] We do
[6115.58 → 6116.78] all the cooling geothermally.
[6116.78 → 6118.78] We can dig with nukes.
[6120.54 → 6120.98] Right.
[6121.22 → 6122.32] We can nuke the moon.
[6122.86 → 6123.42] Is that what we're saying?
[6123.60 → 6125.20] I don't think that's a good idea.
[6125.40 → 6126.78] This is a reference to
[6126.78 → 6128.20] Elon Musk wanting to nuke Mars
[6128.20 → 6128.78] for terraforming.
[6134.18 → 6135.90] We need to nuke everything.
[6136.60 → 6137.96] We need to nuke Mars.
[6138.16 → 6139.06] We need to nuke the moon.
[6140.96 → 6141.76] Pluto's too far.
[6141.90 → 6142.62] If we send a nuke
[6142.62 → 6143.22] on the other side
[6143.22 → 6143.88] and hit it back
[6143.88 → 6145.80] it can come in closer.
[6146.08 → 6146.70] That's great.
[6147.06 → 6148.20] We can nuke Pluto.
[6148.70 → 6149.44] Just nuke everything.
[6155.62 → 6156.02] Sponsors.
[6156.72 → 6157.12] Yeah.
[6157.28 → 6158.38] Why don't we talk about that?
[6158.56 → 6159.46] That would be good.
[6160.18 → 6160.96] Is Dennis back
[6160.96 → 6162.40] to do fun sponsor spots yet?
[6163.34 → 6164.38] Unfortunately no.
[6164.50 → 6165.14] That's fine.
[6165.26 → 6165.86] Why don't we tell you
[6165.86 → 6166.70] about our sponsor
[6166.70 → 6167.68] Zoho One.
[6169.10 → 6170.00] Do you own
[6170.00 → 6170.80] or manage a business?
[6171.14 → 6172.04] Let Zoho One
[6172.04 → 6172.84] make your life easier.
[6172.92 → 6173.50] How long does that guy
[6173.50 → 6174.66] get to be on vacation for you?
[6174.70 → 6175.20] It doesn't matter.
[6175.64 → 6176.24] Zoho One
[6176.24 → 6177.38] takes the essential elements
[6177.38 → 6178.28] of any business
[6178.28 → 6179.04] like accounting,
[6179.48 → 6179.80] marketing,
[6180.08 → 6180.52] and HR
[6180.52 → 6181.24] and combines them
[6181.24 → 6183.42] into one unified operating system.
[6184.10 → 6184.86] Build your own website
[6184.86 → 6185.56] from the ground up
[6185.56 → 6186.14] and maintain it
[6186.14 → 6187.26] with intuitive customization
[6187.26 → 6188.58] and personalization options.
[6188.80 → 6190.00] You can send out purchase orders,
[6190.30 → 6191.42] create marketing campaigns,
[6191.58 → 6192.48] manage shift scheduling
[6192.48 → 6193.52] so you could tell
[6193.52 → 6194.34] if someone was going to be
[6194.34 → 6194.98] just like gone
[6194.98 → 6195.76] for three weeks
[6195.76 → 6196.16] or whatever
[6196.16 → 6197.70] all in a few clicks.
[6197.70 → 6199.08] You can track metrics
[6199.08 → 6200.42] and use data
[6200.42 → 6201.34] to make key decisions
[6201.34 → 6202.38] to increase revenue
[6202.38 → 6203.54] and after you form
[6203.54 → 6204.62] the foundation of your business
[6204.62 → 6206.26] it's time to start automating
[6206.26 → 6207.46] your ordering processes
[6207.46 → 6208.44] and never worrying
[6208.44 → 6209.16] about them again.
[6209.38 → 6210.38] If you're working on the go
[6210.38 → 6211.14] that's no problem.
[6211.38 → 6212.72] Zoho One includes mobile apps

[6229.60 → 6230.48] stimulating website
[6230.48 → 6231.24] designed to make
[6231.24 → 6233.20] learning STEM topics fun.
[6233.76 → 6235.12] So why have boring
[6235.12 → 6236.02] long lectures
[6236.02 → 6237.22] when you can have
[6237.22 → 6237.92] problem-solving
[6237.92 → 6239.04] and interactive visuals?
[6239.24 → 6240.30] They offer thousands
[6240.30 → 6241.06] of courses
[6241.06 → 6241.82] with new topics
[6241.82 → 6242.84] to learn every month
[6242.84 → 6244.34] like their everyday math course.
[6244.74 → 6245.64] You can use their service
[6245.64 → 6246.20] to supplement
[6246.20 → 6247.14] a college education
[6247.14 → 6248.34] or just to keep
[6248.34 → 6249.14] your brain active.
[6249.56 → 6250.70] Simply honing your ability

[6252.14 → 6253.74] everyday aspects of life.
[6253.82 → 6254.80] This is like so true.
[6255.16 → 6255.40] I mean,
[6255.46 → 6255.94] who doesn't want
[6255.94 → 6256.48] to be smarter?
[6256.94 → 6258.74] Which is a thing.
[6259.00 → 6259.76] Like everyone has
[6259.76 → 6261.10] sort of like a ceiling
[6261.10 → 6262.54] but that doesn't mean
[6262.54 → 6263.60] that you've achieved it yet.
[6263.80 → 6264.88] So yeah,
[6265.02 → 6265.66] join the community
[6265.66 → 6266.72] of 11 million learners
[6266.72 → 6267.74] and educators today.
[6268.10 → 6268.62] Best of all,
[6268.84 → 6269.84] the first 200 people
[6269.84 → 6270.24] who had to
[6270.24 → 6270.84] brilliant.org
[6270.84 → 6271.60] slash when
[6271.60 → 6273.22] will get 20% off
[6273.22 → 6274.66] an annual premium subscription.
[6274.84 → 6275.14] We're going to have
[6275.14 → 6276.06] that linked down below.
[6276.52 → 6277.14] The show is also brought
[6277.14 → 6277.68] to you by Kudos.
[6278.34 → 6279.00] Summer is right
[6279.00 → 6279.54] around the corner
[6279.54 → 6280.48] and wow, really?
[6280.96 → 6282.02] The average household
[6282.02 → 6282.98] is projected to spend
[6282.98 → 6285.62] $2,644 on travel?
[6286.60 → 6287.82] Man, I got to up my game.
[6288.22 → 6289.20] If that's you,
[6289.46 → 6290.36] you should use Kudos,
[6290.68 → 6292.06] a free shopping extension
[6292.06 → 6292.84] for your computer
[6292.84 → 6293.70] and iPhone
[6293.70 → 6294.32] that helps you get
[6294.32 → 6295.18] the most cash back
[6295.18 → 6296.00] from your credit cards
[6296.00 → 6297.04] when you shop online.
[6297.28 → 6298.42] The best thing about Kudos
[6298.42 → 6299.60] is that you can double
[6299.60 → 6300.18] your rewards
[6300.18 → 6301.92] across 15,000 sites

[6303.74 → 6304.70] and many more.
[6305.12 → 6306.08] So let's say you usually
[6306.08 → 6307.94] earn 3% on hotel reservations
[6307.94 → 6309.00] via booking.com.

[6327.10 → 6328.26] slash WAN.
[6328.84 → 6329.22] Sick.
[6329.80 → 6330.92] To be clear,
[6331.04 → 6331.70] because some people
[6331.70 → 6332.38] kind of missed it,
[6332.46 → 6333.16] that was not actually
[6333.16 → 6333.68] a commentary
[6333.68 → 6334.76] on the viability
[6334.76 → 6336.64] of various terraforming options.
[6336.64 → 6338.62] We're just laughing
[6338.62 → 6339.84] about things, okay?
[6340.92 → 6341.78] Gotta be careful
[6341.78 → 6343.12] what you say around nerds.
[6343.16 → 6343.92] Speaking of laughing,
[6344.14 → 6345.04] Google releases
[6345.04 → 6347.92] new .zip and .mov
[6347.92 → 6350.22] top-level domain extensions.
[6350.86 → 6351.30] Yeah.
[6352.26 → 6353.86] That sucks a lot.
[6353.94 → 6354.18] Oh.
[6354.58 → 6354.84] Whoops.
[6355.28 → 6355.76] Sorry, Dan.
[6356.02 → 6356.32] Yes.
[6356.46 → 6357.00] Merch messages.
[6357.26 → 6357.40] No.
[6357.56 → 6358.02] Wait, what?
[6358.16 → 6359.70] He's moving all the signs around.
[6359.86 → 6360.08] Dan.
[6360.18 → 6360.82] Well, because you went
[6360.82 → 6361.38] off the rails.
[6361.44 → 6362.38] What are you doing over there?
[6362.46 → 6363.32] You didn't listen
[6363.32 → 6364.46] to the piece of paper.
[6364.52 → 6365.20] Okay, we'll do it.
[6365.20 → 6365.54] We'll do it.
[6365.54 → 6366.48] We'll talk about that later.
[6366.48 → 6367.26] Okay, I'm sorry.
[6367.36 → 6367.78] I'm sorry.
[6369.78 → 6370.42] That's okay.
[6370.48 → 6371.20] I can follow you.
[6371.36 → 6372.36] Hit me with a merch message.
[6372.48 → 6372.76] Okay.
[6373.14 → 6373.60] Uh, sure.
[6374.56 → 6375.38] Uh, let's see.
[6375.58 → 6376.58] Slow plane chat still talking
[6376.58 → 6377.82] about the stupid moon thing?
[6377.88 → 6378.52] They really are.
[6378.62 → 6379.86] I still think we should
[6379.86 → 6381.16] snow piercer the servers.
[6381.66 → 6381.86] Okay.
[6382.46 → 6383.88] Good evening, LLND.
[6384.18 → 6384.88] I've been watching...
[6384.88 → 6385.12] We can power the servers
[6385.12 → 6385.76] with nukes.
[6386.18 → 6387.14] Can you stop?
[6389.26 → 6390.48] Can you stop?
[6391.18 → 6392.92] Good evening, LLND.
[6392.92 → 6393.20] You stop.
[6393.68 → 6394.48] And...
[6394.48 → 6395.32] I've been wanting
[6395.32 → 6396.42] to nuke the moon.
[6396.48 → 6397.44] You guys stop.
[6397.60 → 6398.70] Oh, I'm not supposed
[6398.70 → 6399.42] to show that dashboard.
[6399.86 → 6401.14] It does it every time.
[6402.56 → 6403.44] I've been watching
[6403.44 → 6404.12] on Float Play now.
[6404.16 → 6404.56] I was wondering
[6404.56 → 6405.38] if it mattered
[6405.38 → 6406.68] if I finish a video
[6406.68 → 6408.38] or use the like option.
[6408.60 → 6410.06] You still use the data
[6410.06 → 6411.04] for getting sponsors,
[6411.26 → 6411.60] et cetera.
[6411.82 → 6412.08] Nope.
[6412.34 → 6412.62] Nope.
[6412.78 → 6413.52] We sure don't.
[6413.86 → 6414.50] It doesn't matter.
[6414.60 → 6415.92] We suck at...
[6415.92 → 6416.88] Um, no offence.
[6418.04 → 6418.78] You suck
[6418.78 → 6419.86] at collecting data
[6419.86 → 6420.70] from viewership.
[6420.70 → 6422.94] So, the good news
[6422.94 → 6423.98] is that we aren't
[6423.98 → 6425.04] leveraging it in any way.
[6425.38 → 6425.58] Yeah.
[6425.70 → 6426.56] If you were worried
[6426.56 → 6427.64] that we're selling your data,
[6427.78 → 6428.84] you can rest assured,
[6428.96 → 6430.22] nope, we are too
[6430.22 → 6431.82] utterly f***ING incompetent
[6431.82 → 6432.38] to do that.
[6433.82 → 6434.54] Took the words
[6434.54 → 6435.12] out of my mouth.
[6435.24 → 6435.60] Rough.
[6436.08 → 6436.46] Rough.
[6436.88 → 6437.14] Rough.
[6437.80 → 6438.48] I'm kidding.
[6438.72 → 6439.92] Um, the new CEO,
[6440.30 → 6442.26] the chief vision officer
[6442.26 → 6443.66] just brutalized me.
[6443.66 → 6447.08] He could have...
[6447.08 → 6447.86] Okay, never mind.
[6447.98 → 6449.14] It has not been a priority.
[6449.38 → 6450.08] Linus has asked for it
[6450.08 → 6450.72] for a bunch of times
[6450.72 → 6451.40] and I just said no.
[6451.78 → 6452.60] Um, there's...
[6452.60 → 6456.34] There's more important things
[6456.34 → 6457.12] for us to work on.
[6457.12 → 6457.56] It's true.
[6457.76 → 6458.24] It's true, actually.
[6458.24 → 6459.60] And there are certain amounts
[6459.60 → 6460.10] of that data
[6460.10 → 6460.74] where if you like
[6460.74 → 6461.86] actually wanted it,
[6461.90 → 6462.84] we could get it for you.
[6463.04 → 6463.74] And it's like
[6463.74 → 6464.96] never been even worth
[6464.96 → 6466.98] going and grabbing.
[6467.26 → 6467.38] Yeah.
[6467.38 → 6467.78] So, it's like,
[6467.84 → 6468.30] I don't know.
[6468.32 → 6469.32] Usually, I...
[6469.32 → 6470.32] The way our conversations
[6470.32 → 6472.04] often go about things like this
[6472.04 → 6473.28] is I'll come up
[6473.28 → 6473.58] with something.
[6473.66 → 6474.08] I'll be like,
[6474.52 → 6476.40] oh, hey, could we...
[6476.40 → 6477.18] Is there any way
[6477.18 → 6478.26] for us to take, you know,
[6478.86 → 6480.40] everyone who's posted
[6480.40 → 6481.48] about their LTT merch
[6481.48 → 6482.02] on the forum
[6482.02 → 6484.84] and send them a coupon code
[6484.84 → 6486.06] for a month free
[6486.06 → 6486.62] of Float plane?
[6487.36 → 6488.22] And Luke will be like,
[6489.20 → 6489.84] uh...
[6489.84 → 6490.72] Technically...
[6490.72 → 6492.12] We could do that, but...
[6492.12 → 6493.22] And just by his tone,
[6493.40 → 6494.10] I'll be like,
[6494.80 → 6495.72] forget it, I'm over it.
[6497.14 → 6497.54] Yeah.
[6498.50 → 6498.90] Yeah.
[6499.34 → 6500.06] Or he'll tell me,
[6500.26 → 6500.82] oh, oh, no,
[6500.86 → 6501.48] one of his favourites
[6501.48 → 6502.12] is to tell me
[6502.12 → 6502.74] what project
[6502.74 → 6503.88] will be delayed by it.
[6504.68 → 6504.88] Yeah.
[6505.00 → 6506.28] Well, if you don't want,
[6506.62 → 6507.64] um, you know,
[6507.90 → 6508.68] playback resume
[6508.68 → 6510.46] on the Float plane site,
[6510.60 → 6511.64] then, yeah,
[6511.68 → 6512.26] we could have that
[6512.26 → 6513.34] for you in X amount
[6513.34 → 6513.64] of time.
[6513.68 → 6513.94] I'm like,
[6514.24 → 6514.80] I'm over it.
[6514.88 → 6515.56] That's, that's like
[6515.56 → 6516.46] my favourite thing to say.
[6516.50 → 6517.06] I'm over it.
[6518.26 → 6519.38] I'm clearly not over it
[6519.38 → 6520.38] because I'm bringing it up now.
[6520.60 → 6521.14] Not that.
[6521.24 → 6522.46] That is a new idea.
[6522.54 → 6523.44] I had never had that idea.
[6523.50 → 6524.18] That's a pretty good idea,
[6524.24 → 6524.36] though.
[6524.44 → 6525.14] It's not a bad one.
[6525.88 → 6526.56] But, I mean,
[6526.68 → 6527.60] like you just said,
[6527.66 → 6528.52] it would delay
[6528.52 → 6529.26] some other form of project.
[6529.26 → 6529.72] I'm over it.
[6529.72 → 6529.94] Yeah.
[6534.14 → 6535.18] And like, yeah,
[6535.22 → 6535.86] it is possible.
[6536.10 → 6536.60] There's a, there's,
[6536.72 → 6537.86] there's a very, very,
[6537.94 → 6538.66] very large amount
[6538.66 → 6539.72] of things that are possible
[6539.72 → 6540.72] when you have a bunch
[6540.72 → 6541.32] of developers
[6541.32 → 6541.82] and engineers
[6541.82 → 6542.42] on your side.
[6542.58 → 6542.74] Yeah.
[6542.92 → 6543.56] It's just like,
[6543.86 → 6545.88] is it actually worth doing?
[6545.98 → 6546.98] And are you considering
[6546.98 → 6547.96] the opportunity cost?
[6548.12 → 6548.42] Right.
[6548.54 → 6548.68] Yeah.
[6549.28 → 6549.90] Look at this guy,
[6549.94 → 6550.54] old responsible,
[6550.76 → 6551.62] opportunity cost.
[6552.30 → 6553.52] Well, we're doing that
[6553.52 → 6554.12] all day.
[6554.12 → 6558.38] All right.
[6558.42 → 6559.14] Here's another one.
[6560.22 → 6560.94] So which came first?
[6561.22 → 6562.24] Linus planning on
[6562.24 → 6563.20] stepping down as CEO
[6563.20 → 6564.84] or Luke getting promoted
[6564.84 → 6565.68] to CTO
[6565.68 → 6567.12] or were they basically
[6567.12 → 6567.70] concurrent?
[6567.98 → 6568.24] No.
[6570.00 → 6571.06] Well, don't forget.
[6571.34 → 6571.64] Hold on.
[6571.66 → 6572.30] We've got the timeline
[6572.30 → 6573.08] a little mixed up.
[6573.24 → 6574.40] First, Luke was demoted
[6574.40 → 6575.08] from CEO.
[6575.52 → 6576.70] Then he was
[6576.70 → 6577.98] re-promoted to CEO.
[6578.44 → 6579.68] Or hired as CEO.
[6580.02 → 6580.30] CEO.
[6580.76 → 6581.18] Oh, see,
[6581.26 → 6581.88] sorry, sorry, sorry.
[6581.88 → 6582.82] And actually,
[6582.90 → 6583.90] it's like only even
[6583.90 → 6584.56] sort of true
[6584.56 → 6585.70] because neither time
[6585.70 → 6586.78] was it actually real.
[6587.10 → 6587.78] I mean,
[6587.90 → 6588.16] yeah,
[6588.22 → 6588.88] I guess that's true.
[6591.38 → 6594.32] So he got the CTO title.
[6594.50 → 6595.52] So he was hired as CTO.
[6595.80 → 6597.44] Then he was fired as CTO.
[6597.74 → 6599.14] Hired to a different company
[6599.14 → 6599.94] as the CTO.
[6600.12 → 6600.60] COO.
[6601.12 → 6601.60] COO.
[6601.70 → 6603.96] Then hired back to
[6603.96 → 6605.04] Linus Media Group
[6605.04 → 6605.70] as the CTO.
[6605.74 → 6606.32] It doesn't matter.
[6606.40 → 6607.18] The point is he's Luke.
[6607.38 → 6607.64] Yeah.
[6607.78 → 6608.48] He wears this shirt.
[6608.52 → 6609.12] I just do stuff.
[6609.12 → 6609.34] He's adorable.
[6609.72 → 6609.94] Yeah.
[6610.30 → 6610.70] Yeah.
[6610.70 → 6611.30] I like that.
[6611.38 → 6612.02] I like your shirt.
[6613.36 → 6613.68] Thanks.
[6617.64 → 6618.56] What time is it?
[6618.60 → 6618.98] Is it getting?
[6619.44 → 6620.68] Is it getting to giddy hour?
[6620.84 → 6621.40] I think so.
[6621.64 → 6621.90] Okay.
[6622.16 → 6622.40] Okay.
[6622.42 → 6622.74] Oh, yeah.
[6622.92 → 6623.32] 840.
[6623.44 → 6624.22] That makes more sense.
[6625.48 → 6626.40] Next merch message.
[6626.56 → 6627.30] What is this?
[6627.36 → 6628.06] Why can't I get rid of it?
[6628.06 → 6628.34] Shirt.
[6628.56 → 6628.88] Windows.
[6629.02 → 6629.44] What are you doing?
[6629.62 → 6630.10] I don't know.
[6630.28 → 6630.92] I'll give it to Dan.
[6631.00 → 6631.54] See you later, Dan.
[6631.58 → 6631.74] Bye.
[6631.86 → 6632.26] Oh, sorry.
[6632.36 → 6633.24] Come back, Dan.
[6633.40 → 6633.64] No.
[6634.56 → 6635.48] Linus, are you anticipating?
[6635.48 → 6635.84] Oh, no.
[6635.90 → 6636.38] Dan's gone.
[6637.32 → 6638.06] Linus, are you?
[6638.18 → 6638.98] Oh, he's gone.
[6639.84 → 6640.20] Anticipating.
[6640.70 → 6644.22] Any potential?
[6647.56 → 6648.52] I hate it here.
[6650.90 → 6652.56] This is so much fun.
[6654.02 → 6654.46] Okay.
[6654.64 → 6655.36] We're...
[6655.36 → 6658.08] Being professional is hard.
[6658.08 → 6661.12] Are you anticipating...
[6661.12 → 6661.98] Especially if you're in the porn industry.
[6663.68 → 6665.22] That's even more important, Linus.
[6669.00 → 6670.72] I should have waited for him to take the drink.
[6670.78 → 6671.40] Why did I wait?
[6672.20 → 6672.90] Didn't I wait?
[6673.58 → 6675.06] That's going away for now.
[6675.48 → 6676.82] I think this is a dangerous time.
[6676.82 → 6680.14] I can't do this.
[6681.28 → 6683.56] Linus, are you anticipating any potential turnover?
[6683.78 → 6684.22] Hope not.
[6684.28 → 6685.96] As a result of the CEO change.
[6685.96 → 6691.34] Can you give a scenario or explain when you or Yvonne would override a decision by the new CEO?
[6691.72 → 6692.12] Oh, wow.
[6692.18 → 6694.06] You're getting into the big CEO Q&A.
[6694.06 → 6694.32] Okay.
[6694.42 → 6699.20] I am planning a float plane stream about this sometime in the next little bit.
[6699.20 → 6702.10] So I'm not going to avoid every question about this.
[6702.14 → 6705.66] But I'm also not going to be able to address every question you guys have about this now.
[6705.72 → 6706.68] Because I kind of want to...
[6706.68 → 6709.64] I kind of want to be in the right headspace for that.
[6709.80 → 6714.92] But I will tell you that I am not expecting really any turnover.
[6715.16 → 6718.96] Honestly, the reception to the move internally has been really positive.
[6718.96 → 6727.28] I think the people that know me well probably knew that whether this was coming or not, I needed this at some point.
[6727.98 → 6732.04] And the people who didn't know me well, what difference does it make?
[6732.22 → 6732.72] I don't know.
[6734.26 → 6741.06] Well, and there's also like, I think a lot of people, especially internally, recognize that people only have a certain amount of hours in a day.
[6741.26 → 6744.26] And having you do the thing that you're best at probably makes sense.
[6744.58 → 6747.12] Like, it's pretty logical when you break it down.
[6747.24 → 6747.86] Yeah, I think so.
[6747.86 → 6748.56] I don't know.
[6748.96 → 6753.00] Sure.
[6753.74 → 6754.62] I lost count.
[6755.80 → 6756.90] Yeah, we got a lot.
[6758.24 → 6759.36] How are you doing over there?
[6760.10 → 6760.82] It's fine.
[6760.86 → 6762.74] We are not going to be able to do them all today, guys.
[6762.74 → 6763.42] Absolutely not.
[6763.42 → 6763.96] I'm so sorry.
[6763.96 → 6767.22] Feel free to keep picking up lab shirts because those are freaking awesome.
[6767.42 → 6768.20] Oh my God.
[6768.20 → 6770.02] Don't forget to get a water bottle while you're at...
[6770.02 → 6772.36] Oh man, I should leak an upcoming water bottle design.
[6775.24 → 6778.76] I feel like that might be under the vision, you know?
[6778.76 → 6779.02] Yeah.
[6779.26 → 6781.48] I had a vision of a water bottle.
[6781.64 → 6781.82] Yep.
[6781.82 → 6787.14] So it's just like brown or black, I think are the two colours.
[6787.14 → 6793.28] And it just has like a white stripe down the side with like the V's or the O's or whatever.
[6793.52 → 6794.72] And it's a big capacitor.
[6795.72 → 6796.44] Oh my God.
[6796.48 → 6797.44] I would buy that immediately.
[6798.04 → 6798.86] That is excellent.
[6799.12 → 6799.70] That's kind of sick.
[6799.74 → 6800.42] Ten out of ten.
[6800.60 → 6800.86] Yeah.
[6801.30 → 6801.80] Could you...
[6801.80 → 6802.48] Vision officer!
[6805.02 → 6805.80] Sweeping changes.
[6805.80 → 6806.96] I'm so excited.
[6806.96 → 6807.64] That's great.
[6807.64 → 6809.92] So is sweeping changes is the new water bottle design.
[6811.12 → 6816.70] I would love one that had like the bottom blown out and so it didn't like to sit on the table like it's a burst cap.
[6817.52 → 6817.88] Oh.
[6818.60 → 6820.12] I mean, okay.
[6820.24 → 6821.64] You could just do that yourself though.
[6821.94 → 6822.30] All right.
[6822.62 → 6822.86] Yeah.
[6823.22 → 6823.44] Yeah.
[6823.50 → 6827.90] Or, or, or you could not screw the lid on properly, and then it's a leaky cap.
[6830.12 → 6830.80] Perfect idea.
[6830.80 → 6831.32] Get it?
[6831.36 → 6832.78] Because it's a leaky cap too.
[6833.12 → 6833.98] Man, so many meanings.
[6836.22 → 6837.34] Dad joke king!
[6838.42 → 6840.14] Inception of water ball over here.
[6841.56 → 6841.94] All right.
[6842.12 → 6842.38] Okay.
[6842.42 → 6842.94] Here's another one.
[6844.26 → 6844.88] Oh man.
[6845.02 → 6846.04] Float plane chats.
[6846.18 → 6846.78] Oh no, no, no.
[6846.82 → 6847.86] You should put Gatorade in it.
[6847.90 → 6849.24] Then it's an electrolytic capacitor.
[6850.04 → 6850.44] Yay!
[6851.84 → 6853.80] If you put tinfoil in it, it's a foil capacitor.
[6857.38 → 6857.74] Wow.
[6859.14 → 6859.50] Endless.
[6860.80 → 6861.60] Okay.
[6862.98 → 6864.42] Hey LDL.
[6864.88 → 6868.90] Given the cards like the 3090 and 4090 exist with more V...
[6868.90 → 6869.02] Hold on, hold on.
[6869.10 → 6869.66] I'm not done yet.
[6869.66 → 6870.36] I'm not done yet.
[6870.44 → 6872.60] Everything Dan said, no cap.
[6873.80 → 6874.16] Oh.
[6875.38 → 6876.34] Oh, that one hurts.
[6878.40 → 6878.92] Okay.
[6879.06 → 6879.74] Right in the stomach.
[6879.94 → 6881.58] We can actually do another one now.
[6881.60 → 6881.92] I'm sorry.
[6882.80 → 6888.84] Given the cards like the 3090 and 4090 exist with more V-RAM than most systems have DRAM,
[6888.84 → 6891.38] is it possible to run an OS on a GPU?
[6892.52 → 6894.60] To my knowledge, no.
[6895.14 → 6895.34] Yeah.
[6896.80 → 6898.94] However, with that said, I mean, if you...
[6899.50 → 6900.50] Okay, hold on a second.
[6901.64 → 6902.80] Something, something.
[6903.20 → 6904.84] Rebar, direct storage, something.
[6904.84 → 6906.34] I actually don't.
[6906.40 → 6907.80] I actually don't think so, though.
[6909.50 → 6911.94] I mean, nothing would prevent you from using...
[6911.94 → 6915.38] Someone in Flow point chat is very passionate about saying that it is.
[6916.06 → 6917.36] That it is possible?
[6918.00 → 6919.06] And they have a link.
[6919.32 → 6920.34] And they're spamming the link.
[6921.36 → 6921.72] Okay.
[6922.46 → 6923.18] All right, let's see.
[6923.94 → 6925.72] Linux in a pixel shader.
[6926.36 → 6929.32] A RISC-V emulator for VR chat.
[6929.80 → 6930.22] Oh, yeah.
[6930.98 → 6932.02] Shader tech is nuts.
[6932.56 → 6933.62] It's just nutting.
[6933.62 → 6936.90] Whoa.
[6937.96 → 6938.48] Okay.
[6940.90 → 6941.42] Fine.
[6943.60 → 6944.52] Apparently, yes.
[6945.08 → 6952.36] I just want to say that Capra, the person who posted this, was on it.
[6952.78 → 6953.56] Like, I don't know.
[6953.72 → 6958.38] This must have been, like, literally the tab that they had open at the time.
[6958.46 → 6960.14] Like, I feel like we were on a side monitor.
[6960.14 → 6960.50] Yeah.
[6960.60 → 6961.86] And they were reading this.
[6961.98 → 6963.26] Because they were like, it is.
[6963.36 → 6963.88] It's possible.
[6964.06 → 6964.76] And then the link's there.
[6964.86 → 6966.64] All like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[6966.74 → 6968.14] That was wild.
[6968.60 → 6971.16] Thank you for the speedy response.
[6971.90 → 6972.20] Okay.
[6972.44 → 6976.56] Underman apparently managed to get Windows 10 in VRAM and used it as a boot disk.
[6976.78 → 6976.98] Wow.
[6976.98 → 6981.72] That's not really the same as, like, running it as your system memory, though.
[6982.44 → 6983.90] So, I don't know.
[6984.62 → 6985.04] Okay.
[6985.40 → 6985.90] All right.
[6986.14 → 6986.66] Good job.
[6987.88 → 6989.18] That was impressive.
[6989.26 → 6990.56] Are we supposed to do more topics now?
[6991.68 → 6992.24] Yeah.
[6992.44 → 6992.96] I think so.
[6992.96 → 6993.36] Okay.
[6993.50 → 6993.78] Google.
[6994.20 → 6996.58] New .zip and .mov domain extensions.
[6997.14 → 6999.44] Google released eight new internet domain extensions.
[7000.04 → 7006.06] Most have been uncontroversial, but two are being criticized for their similarity to existing file extensions.
[7006.92 → 7010.66] .zip and .mov, in case you were wondering which ones they were.
[7011.06 → 7020.60] The concern is that users, especially less technically savvy users, may be maliciously tricked into clicking on a web link they think is a file and vice versa.
[7020.60 → 7024.74] I think even fairly technically savvy people are going to get owned by this.
[7025.04 → 7030.60] Because, like, unless you read the whole domain, it's not necessarily all that obvious.
[7031.28 → 7037.94] I think Google's justification for this TLD is phenomenally stupid.
[7038.14 → 7038.64] What is it?
[7039.34 → 7041.24] I'm trying to find it.
[7042.48 → 7044.88] Because, like, this is going to be a problem.
[7045.82 → 7046.38] 100%.
[7046.38 → 7047.62] .mov.
[7047.62 → 7052.18] I'm having a hard time finding it.
[7052.28 → 7054.20] It's not in our links here.
[7054.60 → 7056.46] Man, how are you even going to, like, look at this.
[7056.74 → 7058.58] How are you even going to search for anything?
[7059.04 → 7060.90] Google.mov justification.
[7061.30 → 7063.58] What, like, what even is any of this?
[7063.62 → 7064.30] This is nothing.
[7066.30 → 7067.36] This is ridiculous.
[7068.02 → 7069.50] Yeah, if anyone has a link that talks about it.
[7069.54 → 7073.80] It was something to do with, like, .mov was supposed to be for, like, the moving.
[7073.80 → 7077.38] Moving pictures or movement and dynamism or something like that.
[7077.50 → 7081.60] It was just stupid.
[7082.64 → 7083.80] And I just couldn't.
[7086.74 → 7090.68] I'm trying to find the like, I'm trying to find the example.
[7091.12 → 7092.68] Because it's not just.
[7092.68 → 7096.42] There it is.
[7096.72 → 7097.04] Boom.
[7097.38 → 7097.68] Okay.
[7098.74 → 7099.62] My laptop.
[7100.22 → 7100.76] Do it.
[7100.94 → 7101.36] Here we go.
[7101.52 → 7102.32] This is the issue.
[7102.76 → 7105.24] So you see GitHub.com, right?
[7105.44 → 7112.90] So most people, most current internet users are going to read this and be like, okay, this is the website that I'm going to.
[7113.10 → 7113.92] It's GitHub.com.
[7113.92 → 7117.48] And then these are the pages that it's jumping through, right?
[7118.80 → 7122.90] So the .zip at the end here, traditionally, would just be a file.
[7123.72 → 7124.10] Right?
[7124.20 → 7127.00] So theoretically, you jumped through these various pages.
[7127.18 → 7128.40] And then you clicked on a file.
[7128.54 → 7130.52] And you could share this link to someone.
[7131.18 → 7133.62] And if they clicked on the link, it would just download it.
[7133.72 → 7135.28] It wouldn't actually direct them to the page, right?
[7135.34 → 7137.98] That's how things have worked for a long time.
[7137.98 → 7143.76] The problem is now, because of this at character, as far as my understanding goes.
[7144.10 → 7147.66] And someone might correct me on this.
[7147.98 → 7150.26] But because of that little, I've highlighted it here.
[7150.42 → 7150.68] Yeah.
[7150.90 → 7156.34] Because of that little character, that means what you're actually going to is just this.
[7157.20 → 7157.72] Oh.
[7157.96 → 7159.94] So you're going to 1.zip.
[7160.92 → 7161.34] Uh-oh.
[7162.80 → 7163.38] Yeah.
[7163.78 → 7164.62] Get rest.
[7164.64 → 7165.20] Big oh.
[7165.20 → 7170.36] So, like, I haven't seen things like this personally.
[7170.54 → 7173.20] But, like, that's rough.
[7174.08 → 7174.52] Now.
[7174.66 → 7180.86] So, like, everyone's going to have to, like, sniff their freaking URLs for this little at symbol.
[7181.74 → 7187.94] And, like, this is why I'm saying, like, the whole technically savvy thing doesn't even really fully apply.
[7188.10 → 7191.82] Because I don't know pretty much anyone that looks for that right now.
[7191.82 → 7196.70] So, unless you're, you'd have to be technically savvy and also paying attention to the news.
[7196.78 → 7199.48] Which doesn't necessarily coincide with each other.
[7199.48 → 7202.28] Now, do you want to hear why they did it, according to Ars Technica?
[7202.60 → 7202.94] Sure.
[7203.82 → 7209.70] Google marketers say the aim is to designate tying things together or moving really fast.
[7209.70 → 7216.08] And moving pictures and whatever moves you, respectively, for .zip and .mov.
[7216.10 → 7217.12] It's frustrating because I go...
[7217.12 → 7218.04] That is f***ING stupid.
[7218.20 → 7221.50] I go after Google on this show for just not doing things.
[7221.70 → 7227.38] But then the second that they do something, I'm always just like, how did no one look at this?
[7227.82 → 7231.48] Like, it's either they move like, no one saw this and we did it.
[7232.04 → 7234.30] Or they never do anything.
[7234.30 → 7236.58] Like, there has to be an in-between.
[7236.78 → 7238.58] How did no one see this as a problem?
[7238.96 → 7241.80] You can't just release .zip domains.
[7242.22 → 7243.92] Like, gas!
[7244.72 → 7245.30] I don't...
[7245.30 → 7247.64] This is so frustrating.
[7247.86 → 7253.22] Because, like, I can absolutely see someone at this company getting tricked by this.
[7253.58 → 7254.22] You know what the...
[7254.22 → 7256.30] And then, like, it would be really hard to...
[7257.30 → 7263.34] The dumbest part is that they know, obviously, about the association.
[7263.34 → 7268.08] Why would anyone, other than a highly technical person...
[7268.08 → 7268.82] Talking things together?
[7268.98 → 7273.34] ...think .zip has anything to do with tethering anything...
[7274.10 → 7274.38] Yeah.
[7275.62 → 7277.48] And .mov, really?
[7277.76 → 7279.14] Moving pictures?
[7280.22 → 7282.52] Is this just an F you to Apple?
[7282.82 → 7284.98] Like, what was the point of this?
[7287.28 → 7288.06] Really?
[7288.06 → 7288.22] Really?
[7293.34 → 7296.80] Okay.
[7297.02 → 7298.64] I don't really have anything else to say about that.
[7300.48 → 7300.84] Really?
[7303.34 → 7303.70] Okay.
[7304.16 → 7304.42] Yeah.
[7304.56 → 7306.08] And, like, I need to read on this more.
[7306.20 → 7308.10] And I'm sure there's some, like, weird nuances and stuff.
[7308.14 → 7309.02] But people are going to get owned.
[7309.78 → 7310.78] This is going to be a problem.
[7310.94 → 7312.52] This is going to be a cybersecurity problem.
[7312.52 → 7320.22] A bunch of different IT teams around the world are going to have to educate their users on checking for ad symbols.
[7320.22 → 7322.80] Because, like, it means something about...
[7322.80 → 7324.08] Some URLs are so long.
[7324.16 → 7324.88] It's not even practical.
[7325.06 → 7328.38] Especially with the way that browsers abstract the URL these days.
[7328.58 → 7328.80] Like, it's...
[7328.80 → 7330.86] And trackers and all this other type of stuff.
[7331.06 → 7333.70] Like, and you're going to have to hunt for this little ad symbol because...
[7333.70 → 7339.86] And you'll have to hunt for it in, like, a mouseover, like, pop-up, hyperlink, freaking...
[7339.86 → 7341.02] What are they called?
[7341.12 → 7341.46] Tooltip.
[7341.60 → 7346.24] You'll have to hunt for it in, like, a tooltip or something because the text doesn't necessarily match the hyperlink.
[7346.30 → 7347.30] Remember the old days of the web?
[7347.32 → 7347.86] Just block that domain.
[7348.06 → 7352.26] Yeah, honestly, I bet you a massive amount of companies is just going to block these domains anyway.
[7352.26 → 7353.90] Which means they're going to be stupid and useless.
[7354.12 → 7354.38] Sorry.
[7354.48 → 7354.72] Oh, yeah.
[7354.72 → 7355.46] We should just do that.
[7355.60 → 7356.32] Yeah, we definitely will.
[7356.32 → 7360.14] Yeah, I was going to say the old days of the web before you actually had hyperlinks.
[7360.16 → 7361.08] Dan, schedule me a message.
[7361.82 → 7362.22] What do you need?
[7362.22 → 7366.02] We need to block .zip and .mov from ever being accessed.
[7366.24 → 7367.02] Like, it was...
[7367.02 → 7368.30] Maybe it was possible.
[7368.46 → 7368.76] I don't know.
[7368.80 → 7369.32] I was a kid.
[7369.62 → 7373.92] But pretty much any link was the actual, like, full URL.
[7374.36 → 7375.60] You didn't just have hyperlinks.
[7375.68 → 7375.82] Yeah.
[7375.82 → 7378.24] So that you would click on, like, some other text or whatever.
[7378.46 → 7378.62] Yeah.
[7378.86 → 7382.00] Like, so this, I guess, might be...
[7382.00 → 7389.00] This would have been fine maybe then when it was normal for browsers to display full URLs and for the text to contain a full URL.
[7389.00 → 7392.20] Even then, honestly, training everyone to look for those ad symbols is weird.
[7392.22 → 7396.64] Because, like, and as far as I know, that's already been a thing.
[7396.76 → 7399.42] Because it means what's before the at symbol is your username.
[7400.06 → 7400.22] But...
[7400.22 → 7411.46] But I do think that if people saw .zip at the end of it, and they weren't expecting to be downloading a file, that would be something that they would sniff out easier.
[7411.46 → 7418.38] And because the .zip is at the very end, you look at, like, the beginning, and you look at the end and you kind of know what's going on.
[7418.72 → 7422.46] Now being able to just slap this at symbol somewhere in the chain...
[7423.04 → 7423.06] Yeah.
[7423.44 → 7424.66] And then it's like...
[7424.66 → 7424.92] That's rough.
[7424.92 → 7425.32] Oh, man.
[7425.54 → 7425.82] Yeah.
[7425.90 → 7426.46] I hate it.
[7426.46 → 7433.30] All right.
[7433.82 → 7441.10] Let's jump into Toyota exposing real-time location data of two million drivers.
[7441.68 → 7443.20] Two million drivers.
[7443.32 → 7455.36] Toyota has disclosed that it accidentally left the real-time and historical car location data of over two million Japanese customers exposed for, get this, nearly 10 years.
[7455.36 → 7463.62] According to Toyota, the cause was a misconfigured database in late 2013, which was set to public instead of private.
[7463.84 → 7466.86] And it could be accessed without any password or credentials.
[7467.48 → 7472.20] There is no current evidence that anyone outside Toyota discovered and accessed the database.
[7472.20 → 7477.60] That is completely meaningless unless they have, like, logs running and stuff, which they might not.
[7477.80 → 7481.20] Because apparently they set their database to public anyway, so...
[7481.78 → 7481.94] Yeah.
[7481.94 → 7485.90] That's a very interesting way of saying that.
[7490.20 → 7493.30] I mean, no, it's not completely meaningless.
[7493.70 → 7497.94] If the data showed up on the dark web or something, that would be evidence that someone accessed it.
[7497.94 → 7498.48] If they looked for it?
[7498.60 → 7498.94] Well...
[7499.88 → 7504.10] That's my issue with this statement, is it completely relies on them doing something.
[7504.10 → 7506.10] I think a leak this big would have...
[7506.10 → 7506.78] Would have...
[7506.78 → 7508.02] Someone else would be talking about it?
[7508.02 → 7509.60] I think someone else would have talked about it.
[7509.64 → 7510.26] That's fair enough.
[7510.26 → 7512.80] They may actually have dodged a bullet here.
[7513.28 → 7515.14] Boy, was it a big bullet, though.
[7515.14 → 7515.36] Yeah.
[7515.36 → 7516.62] That's not even a bullet anymore.
[7516.80 → 7517.98] That's, like...
[7517.98 → 7518.70] That's a planet.
[7518.88 → 7519.00] A nuke?
[7519.32 → 7519.62] Yeah.
[7519.76 → 7520.14] A nuke.
[7520.20 → 7521.06] You and your nukes.
[7522.06 → 7522.82] You know what?
[7522.90 → 7523.42] Forget it.
[7523.80 → 7524.50] I'm tired.
[7524.50 → 7525.90] I resign as CEO.
[7530.24 → 7535.80] Toyota discovered the error in April and has promised to audit and improve their cloud security.
[7535.94 → 7539.10] This is the third security mishap they've disclosed in the last 15 months.
[7539.66 → 7542.66] Things happen, but that's a pretty bad thing to happen.
[7544.04 → 7548.36] A watchdog says that Roblox doesn't protect kids from irresponsible...
[7548.36 → 7549.54] Really?
[7550.00 → 7553.00] Roblox doesn't protect kids from irresponsible advertising?
[7553.00 → 7554.42] This is like those...
[7554.42 → 7556.84] I thought Roblox had kids' best interests at heart.
[7557.44 → 7560.00] This is like those scientific studies you find...
[7560.00 → 7561.06] I thought the super responsible response.
[7561.30 → 7569.92] When they're like, we have found, through rigorous study and years of research, that not going running makes it so that you will run slower over time.
[7570.18 → 7571.38] It's like, oh, thanks.
[7571.64 → 7572.98] It's like, come on.
[7573.90 → 7574.38] Jeez.
[7574.62 → 7575.68] This feels like one of those.
[7575.88 → 7577.04] That's actually a lie.
[7577.96 → 7581.68] Over a long enough period of time, you will definitely run infinitely slower.
[7583.00 → 7583.50] Yeah.
[7588.50 → 7589.20] Oh, boy.
[7589.70 → 7600.96] But yeah, like, I can't imagine that anyone was like, ah, yes, I believe Roblox is the absolute best arbiter of, like, not exposing children to bad things.
[7600.96 → 7604.54] Like, like, what was it?
[7604.54 → 7605.96] We've got people confused about that.
[7606.04 → 7608.92] Because over a long enough period of time, eventually you'll be dead.
[7608.92 → 7609.12] You're dead.
[7609.26 → 7610.80] And your running speed will go to zero.
[7611.14 → 7611.48] Yeah, yeah.
[7612.50 → 7617.46] There was something about, like, Kim Kardashian finding that special video of hers.
[7617.84 → 7620.82] Her kid, like, saw it on Roblox or something.
[7621.24 → 7623.44] I don't remember if that's, like, 100% true or not.
[7623.44 → 7626.84] But I remember reading something about that, which is rough.
[7628.54 → 7628.94] Karl?
[7629.16 → 7629.60] Karl?
[7629.98 → 7630.82] C-A-R-U.
[7631.04 → 7639.86] A children's advertising watchdog has released the results of an investigation that found Roblox has widespread issues with advertising targeted at children under 13.
[7640.34 → 7643.92] According to Karl, which I'm going to call it now, I don't know if that's what it is,
[7643.92 → 7652.56] Roblox does little to ensure that influencers on its platform disclose product endorsements and affiliate commissions in a way that children can actually understand.
[7652.56 → 7661.96] I mean, I can tell you right now, based on the limited understanding that adults have of sponsorships and affiliate and how all these things work,
[7663.30 → 7667.68] kids almost certainly have absolutely no idea that they're being marketed to.
[7667.96 → 7668.04] Yeah.
[7669.06 → 7673.74] Further, Roblox's user-created games often fail to disclose advertiser content.
[7674.38 → 7679.18] This is not the first time Roblox has been criticized over its permissive attitude towards ads targeting children.
[7679.18 → 7685.62] A different watchdog, Truth in Advertising, made a complaint to the FTC over the same issue in April 2022.
[7686.16 → 7694.16] Parents, groups, and investigative journalists have likewise criticized Roblox as a haven for phishing scams and other financial crimes targeting kids.
[7694.26 → 7696.24] Again, a lot of them have credit cards attached.
[7696.58 → 7697.88] There are payments in the game.
[7698.16 → 7698.22] Right.
[7698.30 → 7700.16] You can buy Roux or whatever they're called.
[7700.16 → 7711.66] In response to the FTC complaint, Roblox has recently announced a new advertisement policy which will require developers to identify advertiser content in games directed at children.
[7712.54 → 7721.46] The company has likewise agreed to Karl's recommendation that they require influencers to use the word paid in ad disclosures.
[7721.46 → 7726.64] Certain ages of kids that play Roblox.
[7726.76 → 7727.80] Yeah, I can't even read.
[7727.96 → 7731.46] And I don't think paid is actually necessarily the best ad disclosure.
[7731.60 → 7733.28] Why not ad or why not sponsored?
[7733.98 → 7736.32] That's what everyone, literally everyone else uses.
[7736.32 → 7741.60] Like, is paid a common hashtag for sponsored content?
[7743.40 → 7744.56] Am I missing something here?
[7747.44 → 7747.80] Whoa.
[7748.26 → 7753.28] Six of three in Float plane chat says, I have a friend whose kid has a $100 per month Roblox allowance.
[7755.16 → 7755.52] Why?
[7756.28 → 7757.40] That sounds like a mistake.
[7757.66 → 7758.96] I'm not going to tell you how to parent your kid.
[7759.00 → 7760.66] I don't even have one, but that sounds like a mistake.
[7761.96 → 7762.32] Yeah.
[7762.32 → 7765.82] That sounds like training them to have bad habits, like actively.
[7768.06 → 7769.08] Okay, devil's advocate.
[7769.94 → 7771.08] They're budgeting at least.
[7773.24 → 7774.32] It's a fixed budget.
[7775.76 → 7778.20] It's a fixed budget of a lot.
[7778.20 → 7783.20] Of blowing a lot of fixed budget on Roblox.
[7785.02 → 7787.26] Yeah, I don't really like that so much.
[7791.06 → 7791.50] Yeah.
[7792.32 → 7795.50] Everything I hear about Roblox is just like bad.
[7797.20 → 7805.40] Like you hear about like the massive take they have from their content designers slash developers.
[7805.40 → 7811.34] Because there's people that like make games in Roblox, but there's also people that make like visual equipment.
[7811.74 → 7812.62] I don't know what you'd call it.
[7812.84 → 7813.62] Avatar stuff.
[7813.96 → 7814.50] Cosmetics.
[7814.76 → 7815.20] There we go.
[7815.40 → 7815.74] Got there.
[7815.98 → 7816.66] Got there eventually.
[7817.02 → 7817.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7817.48 → 7817.62] Yeah.
[7820.16 → 7821.82] So, yeah, I don't know.
[7822.40 → 7825.54] $100 of Roux is a lot of Roux.
[7825.66 → 7827.46] Yeah, that's the thing that's getting me.
[7827.98 → 7829.56] Is like maybe if it was like a relative.
[7829.56 → 7833.88] Maybe if it was at an amount where they might have to save up for things.
[7834.08 → 7835.78] Yeah, that's probably the play.
[7835.78 → 7843.68] And like I'm sure there's some stupid one of three rare hat or something that's way more than $100.
[7844.18 → 7851.52] But like I can't imagine there's a lot that they actually have to save for when their allowance is more than like I spend on games a month.
[7852.30 → 7852.52] Yeah.
[7852.66 → 7855.40] And like Luke wastes money on games.
[7855.62 → 7857.76] He bought this stupid fucking game.
[7858.24 → 7859.28] Snapshot Rebounds.
[7859.52 → 7859.66] It's free.
[7859.66 → 7861.02] Is it free?
[7861.12 → 7862.02] It's a free game.
[7862.68 → 7866.38] We were actually looking at a different hockey game and picked the free one.
[7866.64 → 7866.86] Yeah.
[7867.24 → 7868.10] It's pretty fun.
[7868.32 → 7869.18] It is actually pretty fun.
[7869.32 → 7870.40] It's very hard.
[7870.50 → 7871.38] We're both terrible.
[7871.58 → 7871.76] Yeah.
[7872.02 → 7873.54] It's really, really hard.
[7874.42 → 7879.20] Man, we've actually played like a few hours of Snapshot Rebound in the last like few days.
[7879.30 → 7881.92] I kind of wish we had footage of when we started compared to now.
[7882.38 → 7887.14] Because I've seen both of us do like actual combinations and like plays and stuff now.
[7887.14 → 7894.68] At the beginning, we'd both just like slide towards the puck and rotate the wrong way every single time.
[7894.94 → 7896.00] All this garbage.
[7896.72 → 7896.88] Yeah.
[7897.56 → 7899.48] Luke has no idea how expensive things are in Roux.
[7899.64 → 7905.26] That is true because I have never played, and I deeply don't care or want even to know.
[7905.64 → 7909.90] But you don't need to buy those.
[7911.30 → 7912.44] Like, I don't know.
[7912.58 → 7913.04] Come on.
[7913.42 → 7913.54] Yeah.
[7913.54 → 7916.16] Just because something is there doesn't mean it needs to be purchased.
[7917.14 → 7918.40] Yeah.
[7919.98 → 7925.40] Our discussion here is to what extent is the cavalier attitude towards advertising to children unique to Roblox?
[7926.04 → 7927.68] I don't even think it is.
[7927.78 → 7932.12] Like, I think we had this conversation a little while ago where I was talking about taking my kids to the arcade.
[7932.64 → 7936.98] And just realizing how much gambling conditioning was going on.
[7936.98 → 7944.54] And just training these kids to put thing into thing and big flashy lights come out, and they get a prize that's worth a fraction of the money that they put in.
[7945.04 → 7955.54] Mark Robert did a really great video on how games of skill at arcades, just like on the Carnival Midway, are not actually games of skill at all.
[7955.54 → 7959.42] And are just completely games of chance and designed to steal your money.
[7959.42 → 7965.42] It is amazing to me that that is allowed to exist.
[7965.52 → 7968.86] It is actual children doing actual gambling.
[7968.86 → 7969.36] Yeah.
[7972.36 → 7978.06] We talked about this on Sancho 2 before about how, like, sports betting is such an endorsed thing now.
[7978.30 → 7981.80] Where it was like a hush-hush, don't talk about it when I was growing up.
[7982.20 → 7986.78] And now it's like the main advertisers for these places at all.
[7986.78 → 7991.74] And it's kind of weird driving around here even.
[7992.52 → 7995.62] And it's like the casinos just seem to be getting bigger.
[7997.26 → 7999.66] Kryptonite says it's not gambling if the game is rigged.
[7999.72 → 8001.80] No, it is gambling if the game is rigged.
[8001.96 → 8006.80] At least if it's a game of skill, it's not a gamble.
[8007.68 → 8011.58] Almost every way to gamble is rigged.
[8012.24 → 8015.72] Well, it's not always rigged.
[8015.72 → 8016.86] Oh, okay, okay.
[8016.98 → 8019.94] But the scales are definitely leaned on.
[8020.72 → 8022.08] What is the definition of rigged?
[8022.30 → 8026.26] So, like, you are to lose without expecting you are to lose?
[8027.00 → 8033.16] Rigged means that no matter what you do, the outcome is ultimately up to the machine.
[8033.60 → 8037.70] So something like a slot machine is rigged.
[8037.80 → 8044.30] It will only ever pay out based on what it's supposed to do.
[8044.30 → 8046.74] But like roulette, there's too much chance involved.
[8046.90 → 8049.60] So even though the house is going to win over time.
[8049.88 → 8052.84] The odds favour the house, but there are actual odds.
[8052.96 → 8057.26] Whereas the fact that anybody puts money into a digital slot machine.
[8057.46 → 8057.64] Wild.
[8057.82 → 8061.20] At least if it was a mechanical, like an analog slot machine.
[8061.40 → 8063.64] You know why they want digital slot machines, guys?
[8064.66 → 8065.02] Hello.
[8065.02 → 8065.34] Hello.
[8066.74 → 8068.48] Easier to control the outcome.
[8068.62 → 8068.78] Hello.
[8069.28 → 8069.48] Yeah.
[8069.98 → 8070.96] But an actual...
[8070.96 → 8074.10] They still, to be clear, with mechanical ones, they still control the outcome.
[8074.76 → 8075.16] Yes.
[8075.32 → 8076.18] But it can at least...
[8076.18 → 8076.96] It's a lot easier when it's digital.
[8077.52 → 8077.92] Yes.
[8077.92 → 8084.32] So the example, the one that I watched, he proved that that one where the light goes
[8084.32 → 8088.78] around the thing, and you have to press the button, it's not a game of skill.
[8089.18 → 8091.62] You can actually change the programming in the game.
[8091.70 → 8092.38] He found the manual.
[8092.56 → 8093.70] He dug up the manual somewhere.
[8093.90 → 8097.60] And you can just dial in how much you want it to pay out in tickets.
[8098.58 → 8099.18] That's annoying.
[8099.38 → 8101.62] Yeah, because I always felt like, no, I was pretty sure I got it.
[8101.62 → 8108.34] And so he made a thing that within 0.01 milliseconds, within one millisecond, would press it at exactly
[8108.34 → 8109.00] the right time.
[8109.06 → 8109.60] He made a robot.
[8110.70 → 8111.18] And...
[8111.18 → 8113.20] It would just make it go past...
[8113.20 → 8116.44] Yeah, it was like no more accurate than if they just hit it themselves, because at the
[8116.44 → 8118.56] end of the day, it was not about how accurate you were.
[8118.58 → 8120.02] It was just about how much it wants to pay out.
[8120.10 → 8120.82] That's so frustrating.
[8121.08 → 8121.24] Yeah.
[8124.96 → 8128.72] Someone says, slot machines apparently have payout requirements and are in fact random.
[8128.94 → 8129.56] So great.
[8129.56 → 8133.16] Why aren't we regulating children's games the same way?
[8133.80 → 8135.04] It's wild to me.
[8135.52 → 8136.86] Also, man, I don't know.
[8137.64 → 8138.36] I don't know.
[8138.50 → 8145.30] With how many skis there is in the casino industry, I'll believe it when I see it.
[8145.44 → 8150.50] I'll believe that a slot machine is actually working exactly as it's supposed to be.
[8150.60 → 8155.20] I'll believe whoever was supposed to check it didn't get a payout for sure when I see it.
[8155.28 → 8155.90] I don't know, man.
[8155.90 → 8156.50] I just...
[8156.50 → 8160.48] I'm not much of a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist kind of person in general.
[8160.96 → 8163.90] But when there's that much money moving around...
[8163.90 → 8171.84] I'm sorry.
[8171.90 → 8173.70] I'm just not going to put my money in the slot machine.
[8173.80 → 8174.62] It's not going to happen.
[8175.62 → 8175.92] Yep.
[8177.22 → 8178.20] It's so boring, too.
[8178.22 → 8178.86] I don't understand.
[8179.62 → 8181.58] That's like a preferential thing, I guess.
[8181.64 → 8182.14] But like...
[8182.14 → 8187.20] Yeah, if you want to throw away money to see flashing lights and stuff, just play People.
[8187.88 → 8188.12] Yeah.
[8189.78 → 8190.14] Valve.
[8190.42 → 8192.66] Finally big enough to be sued by Immersion.
[8193.06 → 8196.54] Immersion Corporation has launched a patent lawsuit against Valve over the Steam Deck's
[8196.54 → 8198.06] touchscreen and Rumble feature.
[8198.58 → 8202.76] Immersion began developing touchscreen and haptic feedback technology in the 90s, but since
[8202.76 → 8205.96] the 2000s has primarily become known for its many lawsuits.
[8206.66 → 8212.04] In 2002, Microsoft opted to buy 10% of Immersion rather than fight their suit, while Sony had
[8212.04 → 8215.86] to pay Immersion millions after losing a suit over the vibration feature of their controllers.
[8216.50 → 8221.22] Apple, Google, Motorola, and Fitbit have all settled with Immersion, while Meta is currently
[8221.22 → 8221.80] in litigation.
[8222.50 → 8227.56] The Steam Deck, notably, doesn't use the same Rumble technology that Sony lost over, ERM actuators.
[8227.56 → 8232.98] One of the few major gaming companies that hasn't been sued by Immersion is Nintendo, whose Rumble
[8232.98 → 8238.52] pack technology predates Immersion's patent, which raises questions like, how did Immersion
[8238.52 → 8239.46] get a patent on it?
[8239.56 → 8243.70] But anyway, Immersion did not sue Valve over the Steam controller, though this is most likely
[8243.70 → 8246.14] a reflection of Valve's growing popularity and success.
[8247.28 → 8248.14] Discussion question.
[8248.62 → 8250.24] Should Valve take this as a compliment?
[8252.38 → 8255.38] I mean, I guess that's one way of looking at it.
[8255.38 → 8259.36] I'm sure they would rather just not have to deal with this lawsuit from a patent troll.
[8259.46 → 8260.22] It's so frustrating.
[8260.64 → 8263.00] How much innovation gets squashed by this crap?
[8264.80 → 8265.38] Hate it.
[8266.00 → 8273.46] What I don't hate is announcing the OC Bay slash OCT 20th Stableversary.
[8274.24 → 8274.62] Hey!
[8276.02 → 8278.66] It's a stability testing software that's been around for a while.
[8278.74 → 8282.72] They're celebrating their 20th anniversary, dubbed a Stableversary.
[8282.72 → 8285.52] They have revamped their site and software to celebrate.
[8285.66 → 8288.56] They're hosting a giveaway with total prizing valued at $10,000.
[8289.20 → 8293.80] You can win all-in-one coolers, cases, motherboards, fans, racing sim equipment, OCT licenses,
[8294.28 → 8294.80] and a GPU.
[8295.24 → 8298.64] And LTT Store is sponsoring some of the prizes for the giveaway with screwdrivers,
[8298.76 → 8300.46] tech sacks, and backpacks.
[8301.06 → 8304.36] Go to ocbase.com slash stableversary to enter the giveaway.
[8305.04 → 8307.06] And I think that's pretty much it for the topics this week.
[8307.10 → 8309.66] We had a couple other things we were kind of thinking of talking about.
[8309.66 → 8311.08] Oh, the ASUS router issue.
[8311.54 → 8312.34] So that was bad.
[8312.94 → 8315.44] ASUS, what, pushed like a firmware update or something like that,
[8315.50 → 8317.76] that basically knocked every ASUS router offline?
[8317.78 → 8320.08] Yeah, a security update, as far as I know.
[8320.12 → 8321.96] I didn't dive super deeply into it, but yeah.
[8322.14 → 8322.44] Sick.
[8322.70 → 8322.88] Yep.
[8323.16 → 8328.10] There's some, like, nerd drama between nerds.
[8328.28 → 8328.50] Yep.
[8328.86 → 8329.50] You know what?
[8329.56 → 8330.40] I don't know a lot about this.
[8330.54 → 8331.64] I don't feel like talking about that.
[8331.80 → 8335.68] I'll talk very shortly about the Overwatch 2 thing.
[8336.60 → 8337.30] Oh, yeah.
[8337.64 → 8337.98] So.
[8338.96 → 8339.74] What's up with that?
[8339.92 → 8342.72] What, you just promise a campaign and then just never deliver it?
[8343.00 → 8347.40] What, you just, you know, promise Halo co-op and then just don't ship it or what?
[8347.48 → 8349.00] Like, I just, who do they think they are?
[8349.72 → 8350.88] Sorry, what were we talking about?
[8350.90 → 8351.74] It is annoyingly common.
[8351.74 → 8358.92] Jeff Kaplan, the pretty fantastic video game designer, hopefully hasn't done terrible things.
[8359.00 → 8359.38] I don't know.
[8359.62 → 8359.88] Whatever.
[8360.62 → 8364.02] Jeff Kaplan announced the single player.
[8365.08 → 8367.88] Basically, everything Jeff Kaplan worked on was, like, awesome.
[8368.46 → 8369.84] So people were really excited.
[8370.00 → 8371.76] Have you clarified that this is for Overwatch 2?
[8372.22 → 8372.42] Yeah.
[8372.54 → 8373.54] Oh, maybe not.
[8373.60 → 8373.90] I don't know.
[8374.10 → 8374.26] Yeah.
[8374.26 → 8380.98] He announced single player stuff and, like, hero mode and all this other type of stuff going on with Overwatch 2.
[8381.12 → 8386.46] And they have effectively announced recently that it's a lot of work working on single player and multiplayer.
[8386.72 → 8389.46] And they're just going to keep working on single, or multiplayer.
[8389.84 → 8390.04] Sorry.
[8391.76 → 8393.78] Hero mode's not coming, etc., etc.
[8393.90 → 8394.96] I don't play Overwatch.
[8395.46 → 8398.76] So there might be some elements of it that got partially there.
[8398.80 → 8399.22] I don't know.
[8399.22 → 8404.68] I haven't dived far enough into this story, but I know a lot of the things that people were excited about are not coming.
[8404.98 → 8407.34] And Jeff isn't there anymore, so he can't make it happen.
[8407.70 → 8413.30] And that was one of the reasons why it was nice when he was around, was because he would kind of make those types of things happen.
[8413.50 → 8418.96] So I had a bunch of interest in Overwatch 2 because it was supposed to have co-op.
[8419.36 → 8425.50] And this is something that Linus and I have talked a decent amount recently, where it's like, you look at the games that are killing it recently.
[8426.10 → 8428.36] They're all single player games.
[8429.22 → 8430.84] Basically, the ones that I can think of.
[8430.92 → 8434.38] And yet the games' industry doesn't want to build single player experiences.
[8434.38 → 8436.64] No, they're like, oh, we're going to make a bunch of games as a service.
[8436.74 → 8437.62] We're going to make all these other things.
[8437.70 → 8442.98] We want to make a game that you literally play with 100% of your time for the rest of your life.
[8443.06 → 8443.50] One game.
[8444.02 → 8445.26] I don't want that.
[8445.40 → 8445.64] No.
[8446.02 → 8450.22] I want to play Tears of the Kingdom and then have Tears of the Kingdom be over.
[8450.44 → 8452.12] And I want to play something else.
[8452.26 → 8457.80] I don't want Tears of the Kingdom to be slightly different if I log out for six months and log back in.
[8457.80 → 8461.96] And it's exciting when you do that because then when the next one comes out, you're like, oh, cool.
[8462.00 → 8463.94] I get to go through a similar experience again.
[8464.12 → 8471.04] This is one of the reasons why I like getting people to play the Titan fall 2 campaign because it's like six to eight hours.
[8471.42 → 8471.70] Okay.
[8471.74 → 8472.92] I really do still need to do that.
[8472.92 → 8475.44] But like I wasn't even trying to rag on you for that.
[8475.44 → 8478.84] But it's just like it's a good like I beat it.
[8479.08 → 8485.00] And then the next night I beat it again because I played it on the hardest difficulty.
[8485.36 → 8485.78] What a Chad.
[8485.78 → 8488.18] Because I was like this game is worth going through again.
[8488.28 → 8488.56] Right.
[8488.62 → 8490.92] And it was kind of too easy on the lower one.
[8490.98 → 8491.96] So I wanted to amp it up.
[8492.44 → 8493.20] But humblebrag.
[8493.20 → 8496.66] It's actually like the other people have commented as well.
[8496.74 → 8498.54] They're like regular difficulty is kind of too easy.
[8498.78 → 8499.08] Got it.
[8499.66 → 8502.14] But it's a fantastic game.
[8502.24 → 8507.70] And one of the reasons why it's so good is because they'll introduce a new fun idea.
[8508.12 → 8512.54] And then before you're tired of it, they take it away, and they give you a new one.
[8513.00 → 8515.26] They're like, oh, you're not quite done with this.
[8515.36 → 8515.58] Okay.
[8515.62 → 8516.76] Well, doesn't matter.
[8516.92 → 8517.82] This is mine now.
[8517.92 → 8518.74] You get this other thing.
[8518.80 → 8520.12] And it's fun.
[8520.16 → 8521.08] And you get to the end of the game.
[8521.14 → 8522.30] You're like, wow, that was cool.
[8522.30 → 8528.16] For all its faults, It Takes Two did a pretty good job of mixing up the gameplay mechanics.
[8528.52 → 8533.20] It was really simplistic because it was kind of designed for relatively casual players.
[8533.30 → 8535.10] So I didn't really have a ton of fun with it.
[8535.46 → 8538.80] But I played through it.
[8538.92 → 8546.40] And it's one of probably only half a dozen games that I've actually played through start to finish over the last few years just because life is busy.
[8547.06 → 8551.94] And that really is reflective of how few of these types of experiences are out there.
[8551.94 → 8554.66] And so I can see why people were so hungry for Overwatch 2.
[8554.76 → 8561.52] I mean, part of it too is, to Blizzard's credit, they've done a pretty good job of creating characters out of these classes.
[8562.30 → 8564.10] It makes sense to have a single player for it.
[8564.36 → 8565.60] Yeah, it kind of does.
[8565.68 → 8566.26] But I mean, I don't know.
[8566.30 → 8571.00] Should we criticize Valve for never doing a campaign with the Team Fortress 2 universe?
[8571.00 → 8571.66] Like, I don't know.
[8571.66 → 8572.00] Probably.
[8572.12 → 8572.74] It would have been sick.
[8572.92 → 8573.14] Yeah.
[8573.20 → 8573.86] Like, I don't know.
[8574.48 → 8576.02] I mean, where's an RTS?
[8576.56 → 8576.96] Yeah.
[8577.30 → 8578.02] Where's a Team Fortress 2?
[8578.02 → 8578.90] Where's like anything?
[8579.22 → 8579.42] Yeah.
[8579.42 → 8580.58] I talk to people about this all the time.
[8580.58 → 8582.06] Where the hell is a Team Fortress 2 RTS?
[8582.06 → 8582.50] All the time.
[8582.74 → 8583.58] That would be awesome.
[8583.58 → 8589.56] If you make a game that isn't trash, and it has co-op, I will buy it.
[8590.78 → 8591.58] Like, I just...
[8592.10 → 8594.88] There's like no options.
[8595.18 → 8597.26] There's practically nothing that comes out.
[8597.38 → 8599.02] And this is not just true for me.
[8599.26 → 8602.30] I will sometimes see when we're talking about something, and we're like,
[8602.36 → 8603.08] Oh, we're not going to do that.
[8603.10 → 8603.76] It's not a very good idea.
[8603.90 → 8606.20] And you'll see some people in float plane chat be like, I'll buy it.
[8606.28 → 8607.00] And it's like, yeah.
[8607.34 → 8609.36] Or I'll watch that thing or whatever, right?
[8609.36 → 8610.28] Like, I'll watch that video.
[8610.28 → 8612.46] And it's like, yeah, but we're competing against the algorithm.
[8612.60 → 8615.08] We have to find something that like a huge percentage of people are going to watch.
[8615.16 → 8616.70] Not a hardcore niche.
[8617.12 → 8618.98] Co-op is not a hardcore niche.
[8619.94 → 8624.48] Everyone I know that plays games, literally everyone wants co-op experiences.
[8624.62 → 8628.42] Maybe not to play with me, but to play with somebody, whether it's their partner
[8628.42 → 8631.52] or just another friend that they like playing games with or whatever.
[8631.96 → 8635.68] And there's like so few of them.
[8636.38 → 8636.50] Yeah.
[8636.60 → 8639.62] Someone in float plane chat, Michael, is like, Portal 2 is another good single player game.
[8639.62 → 8641.64] I was like, yeah, but how long ago was Portal 2?
[8641.72 → 8642.32] It's so old.
[8642.56 → 8642.94] Yeah.
[8643.30 → 8644.30] It's so old.
[8644.48 → 8644.60] You're not wrong.
[8644.60 → 8645.08] Great game.
[8645.34 → 8647.16] We're not angry with you.
[8647.30 → 8647.46] Yeah.
[8647.46 → 8648.94] We're angry about the situation.
[8648.94 → 8655.02] The fact that I still recommend people go back and play Portal 2 as a co-op game is crazy
[8655.02 → 8658.10] because there aren't a ton of like better, newer alternatives.
[8658.28 → 8658.86] Like what the heck?
[8659.14 → 8664.28] And people will look at games like, you know, old Assassin's Creed games used to have like competitive
[8664.28 → 8664.84] multiplayer.
[8665.16 → 8665.32] Yeah.
[8666.36 → 8666.80] Why?
[8666.80 → 8672.84] And like no one ever cared because why would you?
[8673.06 → 8676.46] Far Cry had competitive multiplayer or something like that.
[8676.58 → 8676.78] Why?
[8677.00 → 8683.80] And then modern Far Cry has co-op, but just like a bunch of other co-op games, the co-op implementation
[8683.80 → 8686.42] is like so whack.
[8686.42 → 8689.14] Why can't you just start a new game together?
[8689.14 → 8692.30] Like Joe and I were playing a game called Return.
[8693.66 → 8697.68] But you have to like to join the other person's thing.
[8697.82 → 8701.24] So the person that joins in doesn't get the progress.
[8701.40 → 8702.90] It's only the server host.
[8703.42 → 8704.24] It's like, why?
[8704.36 → 8707.52] Why are you punishing people for wanting to play games together?
[8707.52 → 8711.60] Stop having weird limitations of when you can play or not.
[8711.64 → 8714.68] Because there's like, oh, you can play Far Cry, but you can only join for one mission.
[8714.88 → 8715.62] It's like what?
[8715.82 → 8718.92] So my friend happens to be playing a game, and I'm going to be like, hey, you want to stop
[8718.92 → 8723.38] what you're doing and come play with me in Far Cry for one mission and then screw off
[8723.38 → 8724.76] because you can't keep playing.
[8724.88 → 8727.06] I don't think, I think that was one version of Far Cry.
[8727.16 → 8728.98] I think in Far Cry later you can keep playing the whole time.
[8728.98 → 8733.34] But it's just like, why are there these weird, like just, it's, it's just like trendiness,
[8733.46 → 8733.66] right?
[8733.80 → 8737.96] Like you, you brought up games that unnecessarily had multiplayer.
[8738.22 → 8742.04] One that blew me away was First Encounter Assault Brecon.
[8742.46 → 8743.56] Do you remember that game?
[8743.64 → 8743.82] No.
[8743.98 → 8744.20] Fear?
[8744.68 → 8745.30] Oh yeah.
[8745.38 → 8745.58] Okay.
[8745.74 → 8746.02] Okay.
[8746.20 → 8747.92] So it had multiplayer.
[8748.30 → 8749.20] I had no idea.
[8749.30 → 8755.70] That game's whole shtick was the bullet time thing, which obviously isn't going to
[8755.70 → 8756.48] work in multiplayer.
[8756.48 → 8761.94] So it was just a super generic shooter and the atmosphere.
[8762.24 → 8763.42] Like it, it's got it.
[8763.54 → 8763.72] Okay.
[8763.74 → 8765.48] That's one that I would strongly recommend.
[8765.62 → 8767.72] If you haven't played Fear, go play it.
[8768.12 → 8770.06] I don't know if any of the other ones were good.
[8770.10 → 8771.48] I think I might've played Fear 2.
[8771.60 → 8775.22] I didn't play Fear 3, although I heard that one was good, and I have no idea about Fear
[8775.22 → 8775.48] 4.
[8776.20 → 8777.60] If there is a Fear 4 even.
[8777.74 → 8778.76] Is there a Fear 4, Fear 3?
[8778.88 → 8779.58] You know, it doesn't matter.
[8779.66 → 8780.68] The point is I played the first one.
[8780.70 → 8781.48] I really enjoyed it.
[8782.62 → 8784.38] But yeah, it didn't need multiplayer.
[8784.38 → 8788.20] Why can't you just make the make one good thing?
[8789.08 → 8791.72] And then someone in the chat tagged me and said Call of Duty Zombies.
[8791.84 → 8793.06] I know a lot of people play zombies.
[8793.24 → 8795.00] I find it very repetitive and boring.
[8795.32 → 8796.64] It's a preference thing, whatever.
[8796.98 → 8800.94] What I don't understand is why can't you play the campaign together?
[8800.94 → 8807.46] There are other soldiers with you pretty much the whole time.
[8808.08 → 8809.48] Like, what do you mean?
[8809.70 → 8811.48] There's no, ah, man.
[8811.64 → 8814.96] And like, it's so difficult to make good multiplayer games.
[8815.10 → 8819.54] And especially when you make them competitive, there's all this like, uh, hit registration
[8819.54 → 8822.48] issues and net code problems and all this like crazy.
[8822.48 → 8824.20] If you're not supposed to hit each other, then whatever.
[8824.98 → 8825.64] Who cares?
[8826.04 → 8826.36] Yeah.
[8826.54 → 8831.42] The level of like, what you have to get to is so much lower for a co-op experience.
[8831.98 → 8833.66] It should be so much easier.
[8833.96 → 8838.76] It feels, it feels like people are like, no, no, this is a single player game.
[8838.86 → 8840.46] You don't get to have my single player game.
[8840.50 → 8841.42] It's like, what do you do?
[8841.64 → 8842.08] Why?
[8842.74 → 8843.70] Like, come on.
[8843.80 → 8844.40] I don't know.
[8844.74 → 8845.82] Destiny 2 is a good co-op game.
[8846.06 → 8847.26] Destiny 2 is an MMO.
[8847.26 → 8855.44] And on that note, I think it's-
[8855.44 → 8857.30] New COD has co-op missions, but it's not the whole game.
[8857.50 → 8858.20] It's not the whole game.
[8858.38 → 8859.66] No, no, I know.
[8859.76 → 8860.52] That's not okay.
[8860.82 → 8862.14] No, we can't do that.
[8862.32 → 8863.54] The new COD has co-op missions.
[8863.88 → 8864.08] Sure.
[8864.26 → 8866.04] But it's not the storyline game.
[8866.30 → 8870.34] They're canned experiences, and they're like weird, like speed run things.
[8870.92 → 8872.80] Borderlands is so boring.
[8873.94 → 8877.24] It's just, ah, it's DMs.
[8877.26 → 8877.62] Diablo.
[8879.04 → 8880.26] It's just Diablo.
[8880.58 → 8881.72] It's first person Diablo.
[8882.36 → 8887.08] I just, the amount of just like looting garbage just dragged-
[8887.08 → 8891.50] I liked the first one, and then they kept releasing it, and I was like, this is the same game with
[8891.50 → 8893.78] a new map, which is okay sometimes.
[8894.52 → 8897.66] But yeah, people are talking Deep Rock Galactic.
[8897.78 → 8899.06] We tried to play Deep Rock Galactic.
[8899.18 → 8901.54] I think we just weren't like into it enough.
[8901.84 → 8902.98] It was pretty deep.
[8903.14 → 8904.16] What about Portal 2 then?
[8904.16 → 8911.24] Okay, good counterargument except Portal 2 is a new whole campaign basically.
[8911.92 → 8916.20] The co-op is a new whole campaign, which is great because if you played the single player
[8916.20 → 8920.26] by yourself and then wanted to play co-op with a friend, now it's new puzzles.
[8920.26 → 8920.90] Yeah.
[8920.96 → 8921.98] That's fantastic.
[8922.30 → 8927.12] The COD, if you haven't done it, the COD co-op missions are not a campaign.
[8927.92 → 8934.50] It's just, it's like playing, if you are an older gamer, it's like playing Red Alert or Star Craft
[8934.50 → 8935.70] on like scenario mode.
[8935.70 → 8943.16] You just like load into a map, and you go, and it's like, it's better than literally nothing,
[8943.42 → 8945.30] but it's still bad.
[8946.60 → 8947.84] It's still terrible.
[8947.92 → 8953.56] And I was honestly very frustrated because I heard, I heard that it had co-op, and I was
[8953.56 → 8954.68] really excited about it.
[8954.68 → 8963.50] And then I was so deeply disappointed with what the co-op was because as like, uh, as
[8963.50 → 8971.02] like hyper generic as COD campaigns are, uh, my like gushy goblin meat brain still enjoys
[8971.02 → 8971.24] them.
[8971.32 → 8975.74] So being able to play them in co-op would be fun, but they're just like, no, you can't
[8975.74 → 8976.14] do that.
[8977.38 → 8978.14] Anyway, sorry.
[8978.34 → 8978.98] I'll stop ranting.
[8979.16 → 8980.28] Time for WAN Show After Dark.
[8980.36 → 8981.36] Shall we do some merch messages?
[8981.36 → 8985.82] We are seriously not going to be able to get to all of them this week.
[8986.40 → 8987.46] I'm sorry, guys.
[8988.38 → 8992.10] Uh, there's really a lot, and thank you for that.
[8992.40 → 8993.56] That's awesome.
[8994.02 → 8998.70] Um, maybe we could go a little less dark than we have been.
[8998.80 → 9000.24] People are complaining on LMG clips.
[9000.44 → 9000.64] Sure.
[9001.04 → 9002.02] Yeah, I think that's pretty good.
[9002.80 → 9003.28] Yeah.
[9004.98 → 9006.48] WAN Show After Dark.
[9008.32 → 9010.00] Well, it's a little dark.
[9010.00 → 9012.36] WAN Show After Twilight.
[9013.68 → 9015.68] Still a, still a better show than Twilight.
[9016.04 → 9017.74] I have to swap over the banner.
[9018.52 → 9019.22] There we go.
[9019.54 → 9020.26] WAN After Dark.
[9020.50 → 9020.86] Nice.
[9021.32 → 9022.70] Gotta love those nice little touches.
[9023.68 → 9024.26] Good touch.
[9024.74 → 9025.08] Um.
[9028.88 → 9032.10] Another thing too is like, not only are we probably not going to be able to get to all
[9032.10 → 9036.54] of these, but a huge percentage of these are just going to be questions about like the
[9036.54 → 9037.02] new leadership.
[9037.02 → 9038.28] Oh, yeah.
[9038.56 → 9042.78] Which I'll do a little bit, but, um, probably not everything.
[9042.90 → 9044.60] We don't necessarily want to grind on that the whole night.
[9044.70 → 9044.92] Yep.
[9045.70 → 9047.64] We have other things to grind on the whole night.
[9047.70 → 9048.02] Yeah.
[9048.70 → 9049.10] Yeah.
[9049.10 → 9052.78] Oh, my God.
[9055.46 → 9056.32] Hit us, Dan.
[9058.98 → 9059.78] Oh, okay.
[9060.62 → 9060.88] Sure.
[9061.56 → 9066.50] If you're not handling, sorry, if you're not handing over any equity, how do you get Taryn
[9066.50 → 9070.98] to leave Intel, who I'm guessing offered large stock options?
[9071.66 → 9073.38] Uh, well, Taryn wasn't at Intel.
[9073.60 → 9073.78] Yeah.
[9073.84 → 9074.86] Uh, he was at Dell.
[9075.18 → 9075.38] Mm-hmm.
[9075.50 → 9081.22] Um, as for the compensation of any Linus Media Group employee, I don't think that's something
[9081.22 → 9083.88] that I'm going to be, uh, discussing.
[9084.68 → 9090.28] Um, you know, obviously we had to come up with a total compensation package of some sort
[9090.28 → 9091.88] that made sense for him.
[9092.10 → 9096.64] And, um, and he's happy with it, and we're happy with it.
[9096.64 → 9098.70] And that's how, that's how we're moving forward.
[9098.70 → 9105.20] I mean, there's, there are so many different ways to skin the cat when it comes to compensation,
[9105.20 → 9109.74] when it comes to, I shouldn't say compensation, when it comes to total job satisfaction, right?
[9110.22 → 9112.56] Like, um, I don't know.
[9112.58 → 9113.70] It's really, it's hilarious.
[9113.80 → 9120.50] I saw some, I saw a post just a while back somewhere or something like the way Linus talks
[9120.50 → 9125.96] about hiring passionate people sounds like those toxic employers that think that offering,
[9125.96 → 9130.18] uh, a better work environment is a good substitute for more pay.
[9130.68 → 9136.68] And I was like, yeah, I guess I am that kind of toxic person because believe it or not,
[9136.68 → 9139.86] offering a better work environment actually does cost money.
[9140.46 → 9149.50] Um, and actually does result in better happiness than necessarily just throwing money at the
[9149.64 → 9150.64] onto a paycheck.
[9151.20 → 9153.16] Um, especially past a certain point.
[9153.16 → 9157.20] Like I would say if you're at, you know, barely above poverty level, like if you're not,
[9157.32 → 9161.42] if you're not making enough, then yeah, you'd probably rather just have the money.
[9161.42 → 9164.24] But I think this is going to get misquoted.
[9164.50 → 9166.82] I mean, probably just, just, yeah.
[9167.22 → 9170.86] But yes, I do think there is a value to having a positive.
[9171.30 → 9173.74] What he's saying, what he's saying is there's a value to it.
[9173.80 → 9177.10] Not that he like pays people less actively because of it.
[9177.26 → 9177.70] Well, yeah.
[9177.70 → 9180.22] He doesn't go like, oh, you guys have snacks.
[9180.34 → 9181.98] Therefore I'm paying you $5 less.
[9182.14 → 9183.52] Oh, no, that's not how that works.
[9183.90 → 9184.34] I know.
[9184.54 → 9185.14] Oh, okay.
[9187.40 → 9192.98] But my point is, yes, I do think there's a value in, you know, the like, it's literally
[9192.98 → 9197.06] half of your waking hours, five days a week.
[9197.06 → 9198.24] Like, right?
[9198.40 → 9202.80] Like there's, there's value in, you know, creating a positive culture where people actually
[9202.80 → 9204.20] don't mind being there.
[9204.32 → 9209.30] And if you are the type of person who looks at that and goes, no, I'd rather have my extra
[9209.30 → 9213.68] 83 cents an hour and be miserable all day, then I'm so glad you're not here.
[9214.22 → 9216.24] Thank God you're not here.
[9216.88 → 9218.28] Cause you sound awful.
[9223.66 → 9224.10] Anyway.
[9224.10 → 9230.72] This is so going to be misquoted, but I don't like to disagree with what is the baseline of
[9230.72 → 9231.48] what is being said.
[9232.04 → 9232.56] So yeah.
[9232.78 → 9234.16] Reddit can be mad about it.
[9234.22 → 9234.82] I don't care.
[9234.90 → 9235.58] It doesn't matter.
[9236.18 → 9239.56] Go, go, go, go there, please.
[9240.04 → 9244.92] There are so many things that it's going to be so interesting to just even mentally ask
[9244.92 → 9247.00] myself, like, what will Taryn think about this?
[9247.08 → 9249.28] Top Gear 1224 says it's not 83 cents.
[9249.40 → 9251.08] It's like 10 to $12 an hour.
[9251.08 → 9254.52] That is a number you completely pulled out of your ass.
[9254.76 → 9255.36] Wait, what is it?
[9255.42 → 9255.64] What?
[9255.98 → 9257.20] I said the difference.
[9257.72 → 9260.20] It would be like, however, I have pulled an arbitrary.
[9260.44 → 9260.64] For snacks?
[9261.08 → 9262.18] No, not for snacks.
[9262.18 → 9266.22] Just the difference between working in a toxic workplace and working in one that is like
[9266.22 → 9267.20] good to work at.
[9267.64 → 9267.98] Yeah.
[9268.98 → 9270.50] You don't know that.
[9270.50 → 9277.38] I'm going to need training from the CEO on like when to stop Linus.
[9278.12 → 9279.90] This is just not going to go well.
[9280.22 → 9280.98] Okay, cool.
[9281.14 → 9281.86] Next time.
[9283.62 → 9288.10] Linus, is there any project that you're especially excited to be able to focus on now that you
[9288.10 → 9290.40] will have more time loving the content?
[9290.40 → 9291.72] Yeah.
[9291.86 → 9296.88] I mean, I'm really excited to focus on how we can, you know, really find the right balance
[9296.88 → 9300.80] between making this a good place to work and compensating people fairly.
[9302.26 → 9303.60] This man's an expert.
[9304.00 → 9305.32] I knew that would happen.
[9307.24 → 9308.52] Now mention the nukes.
[9308.66 → 9308.92] Come on.
[9309.34 → 9310.08] We have a...
[9310.08 → 9310.68] We have a...
[9310.68 → 9311.74] Nuke the show now!
[9312.34 → 9313.86] Nuke the compensation package.
[9313.86 → 9317.60] One benefit of working here is if you're not an on-camera employee, you get to spend a
[9317.60 → 9321.46] significant portion of your time working in the nuke manufacturing plant.
[9322.68 → 9323.96] It's under the lab.
[9324.04 → 9325.28] It's physically under the lab.
[9325.36 → 9326.16] We build it under the ground.
[9326.24 → 9328.34] The lab opens like this, and then it can...
[9328.34 → 9329.24] Yeah, it's great.
[9331.26 → 9331.66] Yeah.
[9332.16 → 9333.48] Now who's leaking stuff?
[9334.76 → 9336.12] Like all the nuclear waste.
[9336.44 → 9337.12] Oh, man.
[9337.50 → 9337.80] Wow.
[9337.98 → 9340.36] People like really don't understand this.
[9340.98 → 9341.96] This is wild.
[9342.16 → 9342.32] Yeah.
[9342.32 → 9342.72] I...
[9342.72 → 9343.08] I...
[9343.08 → 9343.84] Yeah.
[9344.72 → 9345.92] I say...
[9345.92 → 9348.70] I know I'm feeling the same, Luke.
[9349.74 → 9351.42] I just...
[9351.42 → 9352.38] Huh.
[9353.48 → 9353.92] Okay.
[9354.14 → 9356.00] I knew this was going to happen because the way...
[9356.00 → 9356.72] The way...
[9356.72 → 9357.44] There's...
[9357.44 → 9360.88] Every once in a while, you'll word something in a way that is like...
[9361.96 → 9368.04] Not wrong, but very easily misinterpreted if they don't have the context for it.
[9369.22 → 9370.28] Which is...
[9370.28 → 9371.50] Everyone's going to do that.
[9371.50 → 9372.74] I'm not singling you out.
[9372.80 → 9374.16] I'm sure I do it too, but it's just like...
[9374.16 → 9374.82] But I just don't get it.
[9374.86 → 9382.88] Like, do they actually, in their heart of hearts, believe that when we added snacks, we subtracted
[9382.88 → 9384.02] that from our payroll budget?
[9384.44 → 9386.32] Do you actually think that?
[9386.38 → 9389.26] I am certain some companies effectively do.
[9389.54 → 9390.34] Well, yeah, sure.
[9390.42 → 9391.60] But like, fuck those guys.
[9391.60 → 9393.46] Yeah, but that...
[9393.46 → 9396.68] I think that might be the component that's missing.
[9398.30 → 9399.48] But that's not my problem.
[9399.50 → 9400.16] No, I understand.
[9400.36 → 9400.72] I understand.
[9400.84 → 9401.10] I understand.
[9401.34 → 9401.68] I understand.
[9402.10 → 9402.56] I understand.
[9403.40 → 9404.20] I'm just saying.
[9404.70 → 9407.42] When it was happening, I was like, this is going to be bad.
[9407.58 → 9409.46] I wasn't saying you were saying anything wrong.
[9409.78 → 9411.34] I just knew it was going to be bad.
[9411.34 → 9411.78] What?
[9413.50 → 9413.90] What?
[9415.84 → 9419.56] By the way, you have a new official nickname, Luke Newcomb.
[9419.90 → 9420.42] Luke Newcomb.
[9420.50 → 9420.76] Nice.
[9420.88 → 9422.14] Courtesy of Float Plane Chat.
[9422.18 → 9422.76] I love it.
[9426.18 → 9427.02] Oh, man.
[9427.76 → 9428.26] All right.
[9428.40 → 9429.00] Next up.
[9429.20 → 9429.46] Yeah.
[9429.64 → 9429.92] Oh, wait.
[9430.00 → 9430.42] No, no.
[9430.64 → 9431.88] It's the same one.
[9432.04 → 9432.14] Yeah.
[9432.22 → 9434.68] What do I want to focus on?
[9435.60 → 9436.30] Oh, boy.
[9437.24 → 9439.88] By the way, your girlfriend sounds very savvy, Jacob W.
[9446.12 → 9447.42] What is this show?
[9450.54 → 9451.98] Let him wear the clothes.
[9452.66 → 9453.82] Spend as much money as he wants.
[9453.82 → 9455.32] Spend as much money as he wants on LTTstore.com.
[9456.90 → 9457.72] Oh, man.
[9457.96 → 9460.56] More labs and writing team integration.
[9460.74 → 9461.78] That's what I want to see more of.
[9461.80 → 9463.94] I think I kind of talked about that earlier on the show.
[9463.94 → 9464.96] Okay, we can do another one.
[9465.72 → 9466.04] Okay.
[9466.80 → 9467.24] Hey, DLL.
[9467.44 → 9472.92] A few weeks ago, I lost my lanyard and YubiKey somewhere and was not able to find it.
[9473.32 → 9474.52] Luckily, I have a backup.
[9474.94 → 9478.64] What was the most costly thing you have misplaced or lost?
[9479.16 → 9484.18] Oh, I lost like a $400 pocket PC back when I was running my painting company.
[9484.18 → 9489.18] I went to an ice rink to watch something.
[9490.06 → 9490.34] I don't know.
[9490.40 → 9491.16] I was with Yvonne.
[9491.24 → 9492.92] This was like very early in our relationship.
[9492.92 → 9503.88] And I realized after I left that it had fallen out of my pocket in the bleachers, which is one of the reasons that so many of the pants on LTT store have zipper pockets.
[9504.30 → 9508.18] Because that's personally burned me multiple times in the past.
[9508.26 → 9508.40] Yep.
[9508.40 → 9511.64] And did I tell you that the ice rink was in Surrey?
[9513.02 → 9513.82] I don't think so.
[9513.88 → 9515.14] So what are the odds I got it back?
[9515.36 → 9515.60] Yeah.
[9516.36 → 9516.68] Yeah.
[9516.76 → 9517.04] Cool.
[9517.38 → 9517.56] Yep.
[9518.12 → 9520.06] So yeah, I went back very quickly afterwards.
[9520.28 → 9521.26] No, it's gone.
[9521.50 → 9521.66] Yeah.
[9521.66 → 9527.74] So yeah, that was part of it is that, I don't know, maybe I've lost something more dollars since then.
[9527.90 → 9529.72] But that was back in like 2005.
[9529.76 → 9530.30] Big impact.
[9530.78 → 9532.68] And I did not have money.
[9532.72 → 9533.24] I was a student.
[9533.46 → 9533.62] Right.
[9533.62 → 9539.84] So like if I lost $500 today, A, that's a lot less money than it used to be.
[9539.84 → 9545.70] And B, I could absorb that very easily compared to when I was a student.
[9546.92 → 9547.96] Yeah, it was pretty rough.
[9548.04 → 9548.98] I was not happy.
[9548.98 → 9555.22] Mine, you know how much money I spend on clothes or how often I go shopping.
[9555.54 → 9559.68] Back in my dating era, I purchased a jacket.
[9560.02 → 9561.98] It was a Done leather jacket.
[9562.52 → 9562.64] Got him.
[9562.64 → 9563.70] It was actually quite nice.
[9564.90 → 9566.90] It was my favourite model that they had.
[9567.00 → 9573.08] And then when I went and pulled it off the rack, I saw the model name was Luke, which was kind of cool.
[9573.80 → 9575.66] And it is like fit perfectly.
[9575.92 → 9577.06] You sure it wasn't Chad?
[9577.06 → 9579.32] It fit perfectly.
[9579.48 → 9579.86] Sounds like a pretty Chad moment.
[9579.92 → 9582.48] It had one of those, the like sweater hoods.
[9582.64 → 9583.08] Cool, okay.
[9583.10 → 9585.66] And like the style just really suited me really well and stuff.
[9585.74 → 9593.16] And then I guess one day back when I used to live in the basement suite of the house office, I must have left my car unlocked.
[9593.84 → 9594.64] And it got jacked.
[9595.68 → 9601.64] And I was like actually really sad because there are very few clothing items that I like.
[9601.78 → 9602.82] Yeah, people like Luke spent money.
[9602.94 → 9603.12] Yeah.
[9603.56 → 9603.78] Yeah.
[9603.78 → 9606.04] There are very few clothing items that I've actually like.
[9606.04 → 9609.42] Spent money on, and we're like perfect.
[9609.52 → 9611.68] How are we this similar in like weird ways?
[9613.00 → 9616.08] The story I didn't tell is my second year at CES.
[9616.72 → 9618.96] To look somewhat presentable.
[9619.58 → 9621.88] I treated myself to.
[9621.88 → 9627.16] It was probably about $400 to $450.
[9627.48 → 9628.30] Have I told you this story?
[9628.42 → 9629.74] No, I just know the I know it.
[9629.86 → 9630.02] Yeah.
[9630.16 → 9633.26] So, so an expensive like wool jacket.
[9633.36 → 9633.54] Yeah.
[9633.78 → 9635.64] It was super nice.
[9635.64 → 9636.64] And I left it.
[9636.64 → 9641.40] And I left it in a cab with my leather gloves also in the pocket of my jacket.
[9642.28 → 9646.30] And, oh yeah, cabbie definitely never saw that for sure.
[9646.46 → 9646.72] Yeah.
[9646.88 → 9647.24] Gone.
[9647.48 → 9647.64] Yeah.
[9647.70 → 9652.24] That's, that's the most expensive garment I think I've ever bought for myself.
[9652.24 → 9654.70] And I lost it like immediately.
[9655.56 → 9659.04] Um, yeah, I was really not impressed.
[9660.94 → 9665.24] Uber's not perfect, but, um, shout out being able to get in touch with the person who was
[9665.24 → 9666.64] driving the vehicle right away.
[9667.78 → 9668.14] Yeah.
[9668.26 → 9674.62] Like the fact that it took so, because I realized right away, obviously, but conveniently, well,
[9674.62 → 9677.94] I don't know the dispatch takes time to, I'm sorry, they must've taken another fare.
[9678.04 → 9680.40] No, he didn't find anything, but no way to talk to that person.
[9680.50 → 9682.20] So they could just be like, yeah, no, I didn't see it.
[9682.40 → 9682.60] Yeah.
[9682.92 → 9683.64] A hundred percent.
[9684.66 → 9684.98] Ah.
[9687.36 → 9687.56] Okay.
[9687.62 → 9688.68] Let's throw another one in here.
[9689.00 → 9692.10] Hey, DLL, a few weeks ago, I am reading the same question.
[9692.54 → 9696.10] What will Baron Tong's role be with video roles?
[9696.58 → 9702.48] Uh, will he be occasional host or appearance, or will he be primarily behind the camera honed in
[9702.48 → 9705.30] on CEO duties with the occasional cameo?
[9705.50 → 9708.80] If he's behind the camera, then he's definitely doing the wrong thing.
[9708.92 → 9709.48] I'm kidding.
[9709.58 → 9713.90] That's just like, that generally means operating it.
[9714.16 → 9716.00] Um, but he will be behind the scenes.
[9716.60 → 9717.04] Yeah.
[9717.24 → 9717.42] Yeah.
[9717.42 → 9720.28] I don't think he's particularly comfortable on camera.
[9720.40 → 9723.48] He graciously agreed to come to the roast, which I just thought was pretty cool.
[9723.48 → 9731.74] Having like, uh, people who knew me both personally and professionally and as a, as a, uh, uh,
[9731.74 → 9736.02] a collaborator, you know, like it was nice to have that variety, but it was not something
[9736.02 → 9738.58] that I think was like his comfort zone necessarily.
[9738.58 → 9740.20] So super cool that he did that.
[9740.20 → 9744.04] So I wouldn't be surprised if he shows up once in a while, but for the most part, his
[9744.04 → 9747.24] job is going to be making sure that this machine runs smoothly.
[9747.24 → 9753.60] Been a fan since you were reviewing netbooks at NCI.
[9753.90 → 9757.62] What do you think worried you the most during this transition, stepping down as CEO?
[9759.14 → 9761.48] Um, worries me most.
[9763.14 → 9764.14] Uh, I don't know.
[9764.16 → 9769.60] I'm mostly worried that I'll just have a hard time actually stepping back, um, and like actually
[9769.60 → 9771.30] letting go of the reins.
[9771.44 → 9774.12] It's, it's a real challenge for me, but I'm going to do my best with it.
[9774.60 → 9775.00] Okay.
[9775.00 → 9777.68] We might have to limit the number of new CEO questions.
[9777.94 → 9778.26] Sorry.
[9778.38 → 9778.58] Yeah.
[9778.68 → 9780.18] I mean, these are done throughout the show.
[9781.08 → 9783.30] Uh, let's see.
[9784.12 → 9784.58] Oh boy.
[9784.60 → 9785.50] What have I done to myself?
[9785.88 → 9786.90] Uh, I'll pick one.
[9787.04 → 9788.18] Uh, I just don't know.
[9788.28 → 9790.02] Do the stick locks fit on the RG ally?
[9790.02 → 9790.74] I believe so.
[9791.34 → 9793.36] Uh, I haven't tried.
[9794.12 → 9794.36] Okay.
[9794.58 → 9796.58] But I'm like 98% sure.
[9796.66 → 9798.74] Tell you what, if it doesn't fit, just contact support.
[9798.86 → 9799.70] We'll get you sorted out.
[9800.88 → 9803.28] Hey, DLL from the future.
[9803.28 → 9805.48] Any thoughts on Kyle ending a bit wit?
[9805.66 → 9807.80] It's a big loss on the industry.
[9808.00 → 9810.60] Any, uh, plans for short colours?
[9811.08 → 9813.34] Uh, shorts are not moving particularly well.
[9813.70 → 9818.84] Um, so probably not anytime soon, but you know, we'll see.
[9819.24 → 9822.40] Um, good reviews, but we're not selling a ton of them.
[9822.44 → 9825.10] I guess people just like buying tops online more than pants.
[9825.10 → 9826.74] I can kind of see that, actually.
[9826.74 → 9831.14] Because it's easier to, especially for guys like tops or just, yeah, whatever.
[9831.36 → 9832.22] I am this size.
[9832.40 → 9833.14] It'll probably work.
[9833.26 → 9833.40] Yeah.
[9833.44 → 9836.90] Whereas shorts and pants can be very, very challenging.
[9837.12 → 9837.26] Yeah.
[9837.68 → 9841.84] Um, you got to contain all of this energy, you know?
[9841.84 → 9842.38] Raw power.
[9842.48 → 9842.66] Yeah.
[9842.94 → 9843.76] Uh, anywho.
[9844.46 → 9844.94] Yeah.
[9844.98 → 9847.42] Thoughts on, thoughts on losing bit with content.
[9847.50 → 9849.40] I mean, I, um, oh boy.
[9849.52 → 9850.34] Do I talk about that?
[9850.38 → 9850.50] Sure.
[9850.58 → 9851.18] I'm screwed.
[9851.18 → 9851.86] I'll talk about this.
[9852.14 → 9860.98] So back when, uh, Paul and Kyle left, uh, New egg, um, Kyle was the one of them cause people
[9860.98 → 9862.74] had suggested, oh, we should hire them.
[9863.28 → 9867.46] Kyle was the one of them that I had actually wanted to hire more.
[9867.64 → 9870.54] I think both of them have done an excellent job over the years.
[9870.54 → 9878.16] Uh, both of them have just, I mean, survived as independent content creators is all you really
[9878.16 → 9878.76] have to say.
[9878.76 → 9881.16] That's very tough over an extended period of time.
[9881.18 → 9883.98] And it, it, almost everyone fails.
[9884.26 → 9890.86] Um, but I always, what I, what I liked about Kyle was that I, I didn't necessarily need,
[9890.86 → 9895.92] you know, Paul's deeper hardware knowledge from my outside observations.
[9896.28 → 9901.26] Um, but what I really liked about Kyle was just his raw chaotic energy.
[9901.70 → 9908.74] Um, just his, the way that he managed to inject humour and fun into tech in a way that's pretty
[9908.74 → 9909.10] unique.
[9909.10 → 9911.12] Like host first tech second.
[9911.40 → 9911.66] Yeah.
[9911.96 → 9916.52] And whereas Paul has always been tech first host second, which isn't to say he's a bad
[9916.52 → 9917.42] host, not at all.
[9917.44 → 9921.76] And he's hilarious, but it's just a really, really different style.
[9922.18 → 9927.46] Um, and so, yeah, I would have, I would have loved to, you know, hire Kyle or whatever at
[9927.46 → 9933.26] that time, because I, I did feel like the tech industry, you know, would love him and, and,
[9933.26 → 9934.48] and, and needed him.
[9934.72 → 9939.76] Um, he's got a unique voice and then yeah, it's, it saddens me, but also as someone
[9939.76 → 9944.06] who's going through my own sort of transition right now, I get it.
[9944.06 → 9944.94] Um, right.
[9944.98 → 9948.00] It's if, if it's not what your passion is, then you have to do something else.
[9948.00 → 9949.72] I just don't think there's another way around it.
[9952.42 → 9952.82] Yeah.
[9952.96 → 9958.82] It, it feels like the end of an era in a weird way, but at the same time, uh, he's been through
[9958.82 → 9966.08] a bunch of stuff recently, and I'm happy that he's taking steps in a direction that he feels
[9966.08 → 9967.50] good about, if that makes sense.
[9967.50 → 9970.90] Um, and it's not like Kyle's gone.
[9971.62 → 9973.28] We just have different Kyle.
[9973.68 → 9974.16] Yeah.
[9974.30 → 9974.90] Which is okay.
[9976.26 → 9981.72] Did someone, is someone asking, did I pull sponsorship on Austin Evans' last video?
[9982.08 → 9982.56] What?
[9982.70 → 9985.82] I actually am not sure what you're talking about.
[9987.56 → 9996.74] Uh, oh, well, I mean, he has a pink car, so maybe the assumption is that I had something
[9996.74 → 9997.40] to do with it.
[9997.50 → 9999.44] Uh, but no.
[9999.80 → 10002.36] Uh, all right.
[10003.10 → 10003.64] Hit me, Dan.
[10004.12 → 10004.96] Sure thing.
[10005.90 → 10006.82] Um, let's see.
[10007.62 → 10011.60] Oh yeah, I should be finding ones that, uh, aren't about the CEO.
[10011.72 → 10012.88] How, yeah, okay, this one's fine.
[10013.34 → 10015.78] Uh, Linus, hope the new job makes you happy.
[10016.08 → 10019.38] What do you think the most challenging part of your new role will be?
[10022.26 → 10024.76] Um, finding time.
[10025.58 → 10026.64] Relinquishing the old role.
[10026.64 → 10027.14] Yeah.
[10027.14 → 10027.24] Yeah.
[10027.60 → 10027.88] Yeah.
[10027.88 → 10028.52] Same answer.
[10028.94 → 10033.64] I think there will also be a similarly to, I think I've mentioned on the show
[10033.64 → 10037.58] a few times, but I mentioned a lot off the show, how there are a lot of struggles going
[10037.58 → 10038.98] from small company to medium company.
[10038.98 → 10046.98] Um, I think the process changes of everyone working here, not dealing with you in the same way is
[10046.98 → 10047.92] going to be difficult.
[10048.08 → 10048.46] Yeah.
[10048.46 → 10050.34] People are going to have to break a lot of habits.
[10050.34 → 10055.68] It's like, I, I have a pretty open door policy to the extent that I can with my limited time.
[10055.68 → 10060.72] So people from every level of the organization will come to me and say, Hey, look, I think this is a really,
[10060.78 → 10062.36] really awful decision that's being made.
[10062.36 → 10065.86] Um, you know, do you agree?
[10066.02 → 10066.96] Can you do something?
[10067.16 → 10069.12] Um, and we're just going to have to break that habit.
[10069.36 → 10069.68] Yeah.
[10069.92 → 10072.98] I'm just going to have to like, no, I actually will not talk to you about this.
[10073.02 → 10076.24] You need to take this to someone else's job, to someone else.
[10076.24 → 10079.60] And, uh, we have to, we have to trust those people.
[10079.60 → 10084.86] And if we can't trust them, then we have to train them or whatever.
[10085.10 → 10085.28] Right.
[10087.04 → 10087.52] Okay.
[10087.56 → 10090.02] And this one here is about LTX, which is exciting.
[10090.20 → 10093.42] Going to be at LTX this year, flying from Alabama.
[10093.66 → 10094.20] Heck yeah.
[10094.36 → 10097.12] Wanted to see if cosplay is allowed during the show.
[10097.26 → 10099.62] I'm pretty avid comic con goer.
[10100.28 → 10101.66] Uh, that's a good question.
[10101.66 → 10107.90] I think as long as it doesn't violate like our security policies, like I think we don't
[10107.90 → 10110.86] allow covered faces or replica weapons.
[10111.22 → 10112.70] Weapons is a is an issue.
[10113.18 → 10117.00] Um, but yeah, you'd have to, you'd have to check.
[10117.60 → 10121.68] Um, I, the best thing to do would be to contact support on LTX expo.com.
[10121.76 → 10126.02] I believe there's also a sub forum on the LT on the linustechtips.com forum.
[10126.02 → 10128.58] That's being monitored for any questions to do with LTX.
[10128.58 → 10133.00] I'm sure if you were able to send them a picture of it or send them a picture of the
[10133.00 → 10135.46] concept at the very least, they could give you a pretty good answer.
[10135.60 → 10136.46] But yeah, totally.
[10136.86 → 10141.22] People have absolutely come in, in costume before and it's awesome.
[10141.50 → 10141.68] Yep.
[10144.94 → 10145.38] Okay.
[10145.52 → 10146.18] All right.
[10146.48 → 10148.58] I'm doing too many things at once, and it won't leave.
[10149.38 → 10151.18] Um, you got this, Dan.
[10151.18 → 10156.66] Hey guys, what is the number one thing float plane feature video or product you wish Linus
[10156.66 → 10159.78] had not leaked, and what were the repercussions?
[10162.20 → 10162.64] Hmm.
[10166.54 → 10168.24] I don't usually mind it that much.
[10168.68 → 10170.92] Um, like there's stuff that's kind of like annoying.
[10171.42 → 10176.00] Like you mentioned the, the subscription upgrade before we were ready and that like created more
[10176.00 → 10178.94] work, but it wasn't like, it's not like the sky was falling.
[10178.94 → 10180.34] Like it just created more work.
[10180.48 → 10180.84] Yeah.
[10180.84 → 10181.82] I didn't mean to do that.
[10181.92 → 10182.66] I didn't know.
[10182.66 → 10183.96] Like it wasn't.
[10186.30 → 10186.70] Okay.
[10186.80 → 10187.90] Well, that's, that's something.
[10188.10 → 10188.50] I don't know.
[10188.66 → 10190.24] I can't really think of much else though.
[10190.48 → 10193.34] I think this would be more of an LTT store thing than a float plane.
[10193.44 → 10198.20] I definitely caused some problems when I wanted to wear the colour block hoodie really early.
[10198.46 → 10199.64] That's what I'm talking about.
[10199.64 → 10201.32] Because I feel like it's more creative warehouse thing.
[10201.32 → 10201.80] Yeah.
[10201.92 → 10206.96] Because we, we had a really hard time getting the, uh, the dark dyes right up against the
[10206.96 → 10209.52] light dyes to not run into the light dyes.
[10209.64 → 10213.48] And so that product took like another year or something to come out after I had leaked
[10213.48 → 10213.68] it.
[10213.68 → 10217.56] So support kept getting messages from people asking like, when was this hoodie coming?
[10218.18 → 10223.42] Um, I'd say that's probably the biggest problem though, is people just wanting the product
[10223.42 → 10224.08] more badly.
[10224.24 → 10226.46] And I'm kind of sitting here going, that's marketing baby.
[10227.00 → 10228.22] Um, so I don't know.
[10228.22 → 10232.00] But you can also exhaust people by announcing something too far ahead of time.
[10232.14 → 10232.58] Yes.
[10232.70 → 10233.82] Uh, like skull and bones.
[10234.00 → 10235.44] Uh, but like, yeah.
[10235.44 → 10236.28] Like the coal bar.
[10237.20 → 10238.04] Yeah, exactly.
[10238.48 → 10239.60] Um, so I don't know.
[10239.68 → 10244.12] That's a in general, the float plane stuff, it's, it's been, it's been fine.
[10246.08 → 10252.70] What defunct company would you revive assuming they would stay afloat once brought back?
[10254.56 → 10255.12] Ooh.
[10257.34 → 10257.86] Defunct.
[10259.00 → 10261.46] I assume you mean a tech company of some sort.
[10261.64 → 10265.50] This is kind of a weird one too, because like there have been companies that I would
[10265.50 → 10271.20] honestly name, but they have been brought back, but not really with the same spirit.
[10271.20 → 10272.78] Like Commodore and stuff like that.
[10273.16 → 10273.40] Yeah.
[10273.44 → 10273.98] Like rare.
[10274.58 → 10275.00] Sure.
[10275.70 → 10276.06] Yeah.
[10276.18 → 10276.44] Okay.
[10276.56 → 10277.72] Just like everybody said.
[10278.00 → 10279.94] It's not, but it's, it's not the same anymore though.
[10279.94 → 10280.12] Right?
[10280.16 → 10280.66] Like this one.
[10280.82 → 10281.52] Zombie rare.
[10281.76 → 10282.62] So like, you know what?
[10283.14 → 10284.20] I say blizzard.
[10284.20 → 10285.20] Ooh.
[10285.20 → 10285.68] Ooh.
[10286.68 → 10287.70] That's a spy.
[10287.70 → 10288.38] I like that.
[10288.52 → 10289.72] I like that a lot.
[10289.82 → 10290.24] That's real good.
[10290.46 → 10292.96] Because it's not, they're not the I like that.
[10293.08 → 10294.04] They are not blizzard.
[10294.22 → 10294.46] Yeah.
[10294.46 → 10295.46] They are.
[10295.84 → 10296.24] Activision.
[10296.36 → 10296.52] Gross.
[10296.92 → 10297.44] King or whatever.
[10297.64 → 10297.86] Yeah.
[10298.00 → 10298.70] Whatever it is.
[10298.70 → 10299.16] ABK.
[10299.20 → 10299.36] Yeah.
[10299.36 → 10299.74] It sucks.
[10299.98 → 10300.22] Yeah.
[10300.70 → 10301.10] Yeah.
[10301.28 → 10301.58] Yeah.
[10301.66 → 10302.00] Yeah.
[10302.92 → 10303.68] I agree.
[10305.24 → 10306.04] It's NCI.
[10306.04 → 10309.90] Some good suggestions there.
[10309.92 → 10311.64] Someone was mentioning you should rename the company.
[10311.72 → 10313.86] Now that Terrence here, you should rename the company NCIX2.
[10314.56 → 10315.12] NCIX2.
[10316.24 → 10316.64] LCI.
[10318.46 → 10318.90] Yeah.
[10318.94 → 10320.00] There are some good suggestions.
[10320.00 → 10320.88] Old school Sierra.
[10321.18 → 10321.50] Mono.
[10321.82 → 10322.30] Microprose.
[10322.44 → 10322.52] Yeah.
[10322.96 → 10323.36] Westwood.
[10324.20 → 10324.60] Pebble.
[10325.38 → 10325.82] Westwood.
[10326.02 → 10326.90] I want Pebble back.
[10327.14 → 10328.30] Westwood would be sick.
[10329.48 → 10330.22] Voodoo 3D.
[10330.24 → 10330.88] Blizzard North.
[10331.02 → 10331.52] Oh, I like that.
[10332.80 → 10334.12] There's a lot of like, yeah.
[10334.44 → 10336.02] But a lot of these, the, the problem is,
[10336.04 → 10339.58] that they were either purchased or, or they were brought back,
[10339.68 → 10341.22] but it wasn't the original team.
[10341.30 → 10342.26] It wasn't the original spirit.
[10342.34 → 10343.02] It's just the name.
[10343.14 → 10344.62] So it just didn't matter.
[10344.94 → 10345.56] It's irrelevant.
[10346.12 → 10347.92] Like the, the company name is unimportant.
[10348.68 → 10349.12] So.
[10349.68 → 10353.14] Man, speaking of things being brought back without the original spirit,
[10353.66 → 10358.24] um, I, I didn't get a chance to watch the Willow TV reboot,
[10358.24 → 10360.96] uh, because, well, I heard it was awful.
[10360.96 → 10362.18] And so I didn't bother.
[10362.28 → 10363.26] I just watched the movie.
[10363.78 → 10365.68] Um, but apparently it's, uh,
[10365.68 → 10367.80] it's already being pulled off of Disney plus.
[10368.00 → 10373.28] And this is to do with apparently avoiding paying residuals and also,
[10373.28 → 10379.52] uh, using the fact that they are no longer making money off of it as a way
[10379.52 → 10381.08] to optimize their taxes.
[10381.24 → 10381.38] Yeah.
[10383.46 → 10383.94] Gross.
[10384.10 → 10384.48] Oh yeah.
[10384.48 → 10391.14] Like the, the fact that your creative work, however much, you know, certain people might
[10391.14 → 10392.12] like it or not like it.
[10392.16 → 10394.44] That's, that's sort of a completely separate conversation.
[10394.78 → 10401.04] How, how, whatever your creative work is, the fact that for tax optimization purposes,
[10401.04 → 10406.08] it can just be mothballed forever is so gross.
[10406.08 → 10407.08] Yeah.
[10407.08 → 10412.90] Um, there's, there's shows or movies or something.
[10412.96 → 10416.08] I don't know which one, or maybe both, uh, that have been produced.
[10416.34 → 10421.98] And then upon seeing the finished product, they didn't think it was not going to make
[10421.98 → 10425.02] any money, but they didn't think it was going to make enough money.
[10425.20 → 10426.20] And it was better to write it off.
[10426.22 → 10426.30] Yeah.
[10426.30 → 10427.92] I think it was like Batgirl or something like that.
[10427.92 → 10428.64] Yeah.
[10428.70 → 10429.66] There were, there were two.
[10429.90 → 10431.44] Oh no, there was an even worse one.
[10431.48 → 10436.92] So that one was finished shooting, but not produced, but there was an animated film that
[10436.92 → 10443.60] actually got completely finished, like actually completely finished.
[10443.98 → 10446.98] And then, um, will never be released.
[10447.08 → 10448.44] I want to say Scooby-Doo.
[10448.48 → 10450.06] It was a Scooby-Doo sequel.
[10450.58 → 10457.90] That movie is done and will never see the light of day, which is absolutely,
[10457.92 → 10460.06] mind-blowing to me.
[10461.70 → 10462.10] Yep.
[10462.28 → 10463.02] That's really rough.
[10464.72 → 10465.74] Oh, did I say Batgirl?
[10465.90 → 10466.44] Is it Catwoman?
[10466.62 → 10466.76] I don't know.
[10466.78 → 10467.24] Bat something.
[10467.32 → 10467.50] Whatever.
[10467.60 → 10467.86] It's something.
[10468.12 → 10468.14] Yeah.
[10468.14 → 10468.60] That one finished.
[10468.60 → 10469.62] This isn't a topic we prepared.
[10469.70 → 10470.68] That one finished shooting.
[10470.94 → 10476.32] And then the Scooby-Doo one actually finished post-production because the contract had to
[10476.32 → 10477.26] be completed.
[10477.42 → 10482.90] So people knew, they actually knew that they were working on a movie that would never be released.
[10483.24 → 10483.54] Yeah.
[10483.94 → 10485.42] Isn't that wild?
[10486.64 → 10487.02] Yeah.
[10487.92 → 10488.28] Okay.
[10488.52 → 10488.86] Hit me.
[10490.08 → 10490.58] Can do.
[10491.70 → 10492.80] Congratulations, Linus.
[10492.90 → 10497.10] Now that you're stepping down from CEO, do you plan to have more time for noncom stuff?
[10497.22 → 10498.98] Any big personal projects in mind?
[10499.48 → 10500.16] Badminton Centre.
[10501.14 → 10501.86] Badminton Centre!
[10502.24 → 10502.82] Badminton Centre!
[10503.10 → 10503.64] Badminton Centre!
[10504.06 → 10506.54] Did I confirm on Sancho already that it's 14 quarts?
[10507.50 → 10508.54] I thought it was 16.
[10508.90 → 10509.26] 14.
[10509.60 → 10509.92] 14.
[10510.02 → 10510.96] It was never going to be 16.
[10511.14 → 10511.78] It was never 16.
[10511.92 → 10513.04] It was going to be 7 or 14.
[10513.20 → 10513.38] Yeah.
[10513.38 → 10515.12] 14 quarts is confirmed.
[10515.22 → 10515.86] Super excited.
[10516.36 → 10520.96] However, that did put me under a bit more financial strain.
[10521.48 → 10525.82] And the machine vision scoring system is on pause for now.
[10526.24 → 10529.00] We definitely still want to do some development in the long term.
[10529.16 → 10534.64] I want it to be just like the techiest, wildest, freaking cool badminton gym ever.
[10535.20 → 10536.32] Sometimes things have to be delayed.
[10536.32 → 10537.92] But it's going to take some time.
[10537.92 → 10538.62] Yeah, it's okay.
[10539.04 → 10542.24] And honestly, the more time it takes, theoretically, the easier it'll get anyway.
[10542.40 → 10542.62] Yeah.
[10542.80 → 10543.38] Which is cool.
[10544.98 → 10546.64] Okay, I'll just pick one at random here.
[10547.12 → 10548.14] Already did that one.
[10548.78 → 10552.66] Are there any vision initiatives or projects that you are looking forward to getting to
[10552.66 → 10555.96] spend more time on when you release your CEO duties?
[10556.90 → 10558.42] So I guess this is more company related.
[10560.92 → 10562.72] Wait, isn't this basically the same question?
[10562.86 → 10563.18] Yeah, no.
[10563.46 → 10564.70] This one was more work.
[10564.76 → 10565.94] The other one was personal.
[10566.26 → 10567.58] You already said labs.
[10567.58 → 10567.88] Yes.
[10568.02 → 10568.46] Integration.
[10569.98 → 10570.56] Do, do, do, do, do.
[10571.16 → 10575.48] Hey, Linus, are there any skill sets you are looking to learn or improve in your new position?
[10578.68 → 10579.54] I mean...
[10579.54 → 10580.52] We talked about knowledge sharing.
[10581.20 → 10581.64] Yeah.
[10582.00 → 10582.40] Yeah.
[10582.40 → 10589.34] I think I could do a way, way better job of just helping to make our creative processes
[10589.34 → 10594.16] more, a little more like dynamic.
[10594.16 → 10601.52] I think that as we've grown and as I've been lighter touch on the individuals in the creative
[10601.52 → 10604.30] chain, I've rubbed off on them less.
[10604.54 → 10610.88] And I think that there's sometimes an unwillingness to just do things differently.
[10611.14 → 10612.20] Like it used to be.
[10612.20 → 10615.54] I remember when we hired Max, she was very timid.
[10616.42 → 10622.90] And so I kind of had to hammer into her during her early days, like, hey, if something sucks,
[10622.96 → 10623.64] you have to tell me.
[10624.18 → 10628.46] And I would even do things like intentionally do a bad take and ask her if it was okay.
[10629.40 → 10631.62] And when she'd be like, yes, I'm like, no, it wasn't.
[10631.68 → 10632.58] And she's like, I know.
[10632.64 → 10634.56] And I'm like, okay, then why'd you tell me it was good?
[10634.92 → 10636.04] She's like, I'm sorry.
[10636.16 → 10639.14] I'm like, well, look, look, that's not the point.
[10639.14 → 10644.20] The point is you've got to be able to tell me because if you can't tell me, then how are
[10644.20 → 10645.88] we're going to make a better product together?
[10645.98 → 10647.04] We've got to be able to work together.
[10647.10 → 10648.16] That means we need communication.
[10648.30 → 10650.40] I just, I don't do that stuff as much anymore.
[10650.40 → 10652.50] And so I want to spend more time on that.
[10655.22 → 10655.62] Okay.
[10655.66 → 10658.66] Now we can get in some of the fascinating ones.
[10659.50 → 10661.28] Let's see what else we've got here.
[10664.38 → 10664.90] Come on.
[10664.94 → 10665.30] Where'd it go?
[10674.66 → 10675.30] Hi, Dan.
[10675.68 → 10675.96] Yeah.
[10676.48 → 10678.14] Dan HE has stopped working.
[10678.14 → 10681.60] Maybe it, maybe it got removed.
[10682.24 → 10685.86] Can you give an example of a decision that you made in the past couple of years that
[10685.86 → 10687.76] TT would have disagreed with?
[10688.00 → 10691.14] How do you resolve that conflict in future core structure?
[10691.58 → 10696.68] Oh, I think a lot of our product development direction has been kind of erotic.
[10697.58 → 10698.58] Thank you for that.
[10702.24 → 10704.14] I don't think, okay, here's an example.
[10704.28 → 10706.72] I don't think Taryn would have disagreed with the lab.
[10706.72 → 10712.44] I think that we're very aligned on that vision, but he probably would have, I don't know,
[10712.78 → 10714.08] set out a budget for it.
[10715.94 → 10718.04] Just a thing that Taryn might do.
[10718.78 → 10725.20] Not like completely changed even the not set, but kind of expected budget within like a three
[10725.20 → 10725.76] month period.
[10725.96 → 10726.20] Yeah.
[10727.76 → 10729.28] One building, some people.
[10729.44 → 10731.18] No bigger building, more people.
[10731.78 → 10732.02] Yeah.
[10732.02 → 10734.00] That's how I roll, baby.
[10735.46 → 10736.02] And...
[10736.02 → 10737.64] But he also, I mean, he also might though.
[10738.20 → 10743.78] Well, that's the thing is, the money is still coming from the organization here.
[10743.96 → 10749.76] So in theory, if he does a good job, the organization will make even more money, which means even
[10749.76 → 10750.92] more irresponsible spending.
[10750.92 → 10755.34] We're just going to write down how much money we're going to irresponsibly spend before we
[10755.34 → 10755.82] spend it.
[10755.88 → 10756.08] Yeah.
[10756.20 → 10759.44] Instead of just finding out after we've spent it.
[10759.52 → 10764.68] And that doesn't mean that it couldn't change based on learning new things or whatever else.
[10764.84 → 10765.02] Yeah.
[10765.16 → 10767.02] But it will still be written down first.
[10767.10 → 10772.42] And to be clear, like Yvonne always made sure I never actually did anything that we couldn't
[10772.42 → 10773.14] afford to do.
[10773.46 → 10776.40] It's just that Yvonne's a lot more malleable for me.
[10777.10 → 10779.54] She'll be like, yeah, I really don't know if this makes sense.
[10779.62 → 10780.86] And I'll be like, please.
[10782.42 → 10783.44] I'll just make more money.
[10783.52 → 10784.00] It's okay.
[10784.64 → 10785.38] We'll just spend it.
[10786.16 → 10787.22] This is a perfect idea.
[10787.30 → 10788.06] I'm pretty sure.
[10788.46 → 10791.38] She'll be like, okay, let me see what I can do.
[10791.70 → 10793.58] That's pretty much the dynamic.
[10793.70 → 10794.10] She's great.
[10797.42 → 10797.82] Okay.
[10797.86 → 10798.46] Next up.
[10798.90 → 10803.52] Linus, with how much you include family on the show, hosting a podcast with your wife
[10803.52 → 10808.22] and building servers with your son, have you ever had to debate how much of your personal
[10808.22 → 10810.48] life should be on the show?
[10811.12 → 10811.84] Oh, absolutely.
[10812.26 → 10814.20] I mean, I, uh.
[10816.26 → 10816.70] Oops.
[10818.18 → 10818.96] What'd you do?
[10819.28 → 10821.88] I meant to go new line and I sent a reply.
[10822.20 → 10823.96] So someone, sorry, I'm going to interject for a second.
[10824.14 → 10828.54] Somebody was like, what software that you use on a daily basis that you hate, and what changes
[10828.54 → 10829.02] would you make?
[10829.02 → 10833.56] I was, I was new lining to type teams.
[10833.76 → 10836.80] I had typed Slack, and I was trying to get a new line.
[10837.86 → 10842.56] Corporate communication software, in my opinion, is in an absolute trash state.
[10842.68 → 10847.96] It's ridiculous that I would honestly rather use discord if it didn't have some like weird
[10847.96 → 10849.10] limitations on it.
[10849.54 → 10855.76] Um, if there was like discord for business, it'd probably just move everybody to that.
[10855.76 → 10862.86] Cause like teams and Slack are both just so bad at like really weird, basic things.
[10863.24 → 10867.76] And like, there are some things about teams that I like more about Slack and there's some
[10867.76 → 10869.04] things about Slack that I like more than teams.
[10869.20 → 10872.18] I'm not saying either of them is necessarily better than the other.
[10872.28 → 10875.24] It kind of depends on what style of team you have, Ada, Ada, Ada.
[10875.24 → 10881.20] But they're just both like, I just want MSN messenger back.
[10882.46 → 10884.66] Um, anyway, in response to your question.
[10884.94 → 10885.38] Yeah.
[10885.40 → 10887.40] It's something that Yvonne and I talk about a lot.
[10887.46 → 10892.66] It's something that I feel like I kind of intuitively try to silo.
[10892.66 → 10901.16] Um, I think for a long time I was probably just posting too much on Twitter because a lot
[10901.16 → 10907.86] of the time these aren't, that's, it's not even really like, oh, it's not well articulated,
[10908.22 → 10909.46] which doesn't help.
[10909.78 → 10912.74] And a lot of the time it's just like how I'm feeling at the moment.
[10912.74 → 10918.34] I think that platform really is designed for people to be their, their worst, most impulsive
[10918.34 → 10918.80] selves.
[10919.14 → 10924.20] So now that I almost never post on Twitter, I'm definitely doing, I'm definitely doing
[10924.20 → 10931.72] a better job of keeping my, my personal feelings and my personal life offline while still managing
[10931.72 → 10934.70] to be a prolific online personality.
[10935.48 → 10936.12] Yeah.
[10937.22 → 10943.88] For Luke, how much emphasis, uh, is put on tests and feature flags when rolling out features?
[10944.06 → 10948.32] I've noticed that as companies get bigger, features take longer to develop as test
[10948.32 → 10949.78] becomes a requirement.
[10951.30 → 10953.30] Yeah, we do that stuff.
[10953.70 → 10955.48] Um, are we the best at it?
[10955.54 → 10955.88] No.
[10957.44 → 10963.32] Um, we've had like pushes in our history to be like, oh, we need to add tests for like
[10963.32 → 10964.02] all the things.
[10964.02 → 10968.10] And then it like often doesn't really help.
[10968.22 → 10968.88] I don't know.
[10968.88 → 10976.14] Uh, there's a lot of people that will fight very viciously on both sides.
[10976.14 → 10978.56] People that say tests are a hard requirement.
[10978.56 → 10980.58] Other people that say tests are a waste of time.
[10981.08 → 10986.40] Um, I think if you're not doing it properly, it's just a waste of time.
[10986.76 → 10989.58] Um, we have often not necessarily done it properly.
[10989.58 → 10992.26] There is a time in our history where I think we did a perfect job.
[10992.66 → 10997.78] Um, I don't necessarily think we're doing that now, but what we are doing now is better.
[10997.78 → 11002.52] Like QA of the stuff that we're doing.
[11003.14 → 11008.60] So we have an internal, uh, an internal platform that, uh, developers can use for testing.
[11008.60 → 11013.22] And sometimes we'll like, it's been pretty cool having other teams in our Slack.
[11013.22 → 11018.14] So like the labs web dev team, and even some of the labs, local, uh, developers are in
[11018.14 → 11018.88] Slack with us.
[11018.96 → 11023.48] Uh, so the labs team or the float plane team, vice versa will be like, Hey, other people that
[11023.48 → 11026.76] don't work on this, but are also developers, uh, try to pick this apart.
[11026.76 → 11027.52] See what happens.
[11027.84 → 11028.86] And it's, it's useful.
[11029.00 → 11031.58] And then sometimes we'll scale beyond that and we'll have.
[11032.56 → 11036.02] It will, we'll throw it at another team in the company that is not necessarily technical,
[11036.02 → 11038.10] but it's useful to have them try to pick it apart.
[11038.44 → 11042.24] Uh, and then we have another layer, which is the beta site, which you don't have to use
[11042.24 → 11047.02] anymore, by the way, users, uh, because the main site has been updated with all the
[11047.02 → 11047.74] beta site features.
[11047.74 → 11049.18] So you can just use the main site now.
[11049.22 → 11050.60] And I would actually recommend doing that.
[11050.94 → 11056.16] Um, but we're going to very likely continue to use the beta site to test stuff.
[11056.16 → 11060.36] Um, so we have a bunch of layers of increasing the amount of users and the type of users
[11060.36 → 11062.24] that, that try stuff firsthand.
[11062.90 → 11066.60] Um, and that's kind of our preferred route at this point.
[11067.22 → 11067.70] Yeah.
[11067.90 → 11073.74] I think there are other, honestly, significantly bigger reasons why large companies move slower
[11073.74 → 11075.58] with product releases than writing tests.
[11075.82 → 11079.36] Uh, I would personally say, but I could be wrong there because I don't have experience
[11079.36 → 11080.00] at those companies.
[11082.66 → 11083.58] Hello guys.
[11084.16 → 11089.26] I'm in high school and my best friend's parents have video cameras to monitor what he does
[11089.26 → 11090.00] on his computer.
[11090.00 → 11091.78] Do you think that this is too far?
[11092.00 → 11093.28] Hope you guys have a nice show.
[11094.32 → 11094.74] Okay.
[11094.92 → 11095.24] Sorry.
[11095.44 → 11096.44] Did you say high school?
[11096.64 → 11097.04] High school.
[11097.28 → 11100.82] Oh, that's getting pretty old for nanny.
[11100.82 → 11103.22] Um, I monitor my kids.
[11104.00 → 11108.56] My eldest is not in high school though.
[11108.98 → 11113.74] Um, I think that at a certain point kids start to need their privacy and that sort of supervision
[11113.74 → 11114.60] becomes oppressive.
[11115.88 → 11120.72] However, just because you're in high school or even just because you're legally an adult
[11120.72 → 11125.62] doesn't necessarily mean that your parents don't still know what's better for you sometimes.
[11125.62 → 11128.84] And I don't know everything about their unique situation.
[11128.84 → 11134.50] I mean, maybe this individual is, you know, seriously at risk of some kind of, uh, self
[11134.50 → 11135.58] harm, for example.
[11136.26 → 11141.62] Um, you know, without getting into too much detail, I knew someone when I was in high school
[11141.62 → 11146.72] who spent time on like, uh, pro anorexia forums and stuff like that.
[11147.10 → 11153.52] And, you know, I think that it would have been in their parents and this person's best interest,
[11153.52 → 11160.38] even though they were well advanced into their high school years to monitor that and prevent
[11160.38 → 11163.14] that if they in any way could do that.
[11163.50 → 11169.32] Um, that's a community that someone with body image issues doesn't need to be participating
[11169.32 → 11169.68] in.
[11170.00 → 11171.90] Uh, that is objectively true.
[11172.22 → 11177.38] And, um, I wasn't listening to most of this.
[11177.44 → 11179.90] You just said it's objectively true, and you're talking about body image issues.
[11179.90 → 11181.86] So I'm hoping this is going okay.
[11183.52 → 11186.04] Luke, I embrace for impact.
[11186.26 → 11188.46] Luke, in your experience, has it ever gone okay?
[11188.98 → 11189.46] Yeah.
[11189.64 → 11189.78] Yeah.
[11189.90 → 11191.50] No, it definitely has.
[11191.92 → 11193.56] It goes okay the vast majority of the time.
[11193.88 → 11195.20] Um, but yeah, I don't know.
[11195.30 → 11201.52] There's one thing that I would consider is, uh, your, your kids are probably not like, you
[11201.52 → 11202.40] know, stupid.
[11202.82 → 11208.42] Um, so if they really want to get around it, you're telling them that you're watching them
[11208.42 → 11209.28] with a camera.
[11209.28 → 11209.36] Yeah.
[11210.74 → 11212.52] So they'll find another way.
[11212.72 → 11216.22] The takeout corner in the basement specifically doesn't have a camera pointed at it.
[11216.42 → 11219.06] We just assume it's going to be a takeout corner at some point.
[11219.12 → 11220.92] You know, that, uh, that spot under the stairs.
[11221.46 → 11225.30] Ah, that will almost certainly be a takeout corner because you'll be able to hear anyone
[11225.30 → 11228.40] coming down the stairs and quickly, you know, assemble yourselves.
[11228.62 → 11228.86] Yeah.
[11230.06 → 11230.90] Kids will be kids.
[11231.34 → 11231.58] Yeah.
[11231.58 → 11234.50] So like, you have to understand that to a certain degree.
[11240.32 → 11245.50] It's, it's tough because I've, I've thought about the situation of like growing up in my
[11245.50 → 11250.00] house was harder for that type of stuff than most of my friends because my dad was always
[11250.00 → 11250.60] been technical.
[11250.92 → 11251.22] Yeah.
[11251.30 → 11254.30] And that's got to be rough for, for your kids as well.
[11254.30 → 11255.02] Like, good luck.
[11255.02 → 11261.32] Like, so like, I don't know, but what I really want is to not have to supervise them.
[11261.58 → 11267.56] So that's the foundation we're trying to build now is like, Hey, if you do something, you
[11267.56 → 11272.88] shouldn't the best course of action, the, the, the, the best time to tell me about it was
[11272.88 → 11277.34] then the second-best time is now the worst time is not yet.
[11277.34 → 11283.86] Um, you know, they, all of my kids know that if you do something wrong, you're in a bit
[11283.86 → 11284.30] of trouble.
[11285.18 → 11288.26] Um, but we love you, and we'll figure it out.
[11288.78 → 11294.28] If you lie about it, you're in a lot of trouble and trust is hard to rebuild.
[11295.06 → 11298.54] Um, and so that's, that's really the way that we try to message everything.
[11298.54 → 11304.00] And the hope is that we can build a strong enough foundation where they just kind of go,
[11304.00 → 11309.18] okay, yeah, it's actually a much better path to just talk about these things rather than
[11309.18 → 11310.58] waiting to be found out.
[11310.68 → 11318.26] And we've found out enough things through just being watchful, um, that hopefully we've created,
[11318.26 → 11324.24] uh, enough of a pattern for them to recognize that it's not actually worth it.
[11324.70 → 11328.10] And it's better to just talk about it.
[11328.68 → 11329.20] Hopefully.
[11329.34 → 11330.54] I mean, who knows, right?
[11330.54 → 11334.82] Like people are, people are imperfect.
[11335.02 → 11335.72] People are messy.
[11336.06 → 11337.60] People, life is messy, right?
[11337.60 → 11339.40] I don't, I don't know where my kids are going to end up.
[11339.44 → 11340.68] I obviously hope for the best.
[11341.00 → 11344.10] And sometimes you have to figure out things on your own.
[11345.62 → 11349.48] So like, but this comes into the like, you're talking about like, okay, we monitor now, but
[11349.48 → 11350.86] he's not in high school yet, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[11351.14 → 11351.36] Yeah.
[11351.36 → 11357.10] There are certain things about yourself, about how you are positioned in life, about the world
[11357.10 → 11363.90] that you're going to want to dive into, discover, do research on whatever on your own so that
[11363.90 → 11364.92] it feels more organic.
[11364.92 → 11367.88] And so you can come to answers on your own.
[11368.02 → 11369.30] So that'll happen eventually.
[11369.30 → 11375.64] But like, there's, yeah, there's also people that go down terrible paths, like you were
[11375.64 → 11375.90] mentioning.
[11376.02 → 11377.04] So like, I don't know.
[11377.30 → 11377.78] It's tough.
[11378.20 → 11378.34] Yeah.
[11378.38 → 11380.32] And it's, you can't prevent it these days.
[11380.32 → 11380.56] Nope.
[11380.82 → 11385.28] Like, I mean, we've got people in the chat talking about like, like porn blocking.
[11385.28 → 11386.24] It's like, good luck.
[11386.68 → 11386.94] Oh yeah.
[11386.96 → 11388.08] That like, doesn't matter.
[11388.28 → 11388.48] Yeah.
[11389.28 → 11390.04] Utterly irrelevant.
[11390.18 → 11392.02] You're far better off just meeting that head on.
[11392.30 → 11393.72] You'd have to block the internet.
[11393.94 → 11395.34] Like it's literally everywhere.
[11395.52 → 11395.70] Yeah.
[11396.14 → 11400.52] Man, I was, I think I'd mentioned this on Sancho a little while ago, but I was on Twitter
[11400.52 → 11402.92] looking at just like some utterly unrelated hashtag.
[11402.92 → 11405.02] And it's like, whoa, that was hardcore pornography.
[11405.24 → 11405.54] Yeah.
[11405.82 → 11408.40] Like just, just like that.
[11408.42 → 11410.54] And you can kind of go, okay, well don't have the Twitter app.
[11410.58 → 11410.68] Yeah.
[11410.68 → 11411.78] But it's like, it's on the web.
[11411.78 → 11417.16] It's, you can just access it through a browser and that's just, that's just like mainstream.
[11417.36 → 11421.68] I couldn't possibly hope to block every site that just has pornography on it.
[11421.90 → 11424.18] Like you said, I would just have to block the internet.
[11424.96 → 11425.40] YouTube.
[11425.68 → 11426.48] I'll just be Iran.
[11426.60 → 11427.70] I'll just make my own internet.
[11429.68 → 11435.16] You wouldn't be able to have any of the platforms that you do business on accessible
[11435.16 → 11435.86] from your house.
[11436.38 → 11436.84] Yeah.
[11436.84 → 11440.58] There's some pretty wild music videos on YouTube and stuff.
[11440.58 → 11444.54] I was like, is this for real right now?
[11444.76 → 11445.12] Yeah.
[11446.52 → 11450.32] They, they're actually licking alcohol off breasts.
[11450.88 → 11451.40] Like.
[11453.32 → 11458.20] I believe that's been a trope in music for a while, but I think it's getting like more,
[11458.20 → 11461.40] uh, less covered up recently.
[11461.58 → 11461.88] It feels.
[11462.06 → 11462.22] Yeah.
[11465.28 → 11467.46] Such a parent way of saying that.
[11467.46 → 11470.40] The girls should need music video.
[11470.58 → 11470.74] Sure.
[11472.78 → 11475.80] Put some clothes on for God's sakes.
[11476.04 → 11476.26] Yeah.
[11476.42 → 11476.60] Yeah.
[11476.68 → 11477.32] Anyway, sorry.
[11478.92 → 11479.32] Hi DLL.
[11479.70 → 11484.12] Hypothetically, if the new CEO wants to stop the WAN show for whatever reason, how would
[11484.12 → 11485.14] you resolve that conflict?
[11485.92 → 11487.28] Stop the WAN show.
[11487.28 → 11494.54] Um, well, I think we would sit down and look at the numbers and, um, you know, here's that,
[11494.66 → 11495.50] here's that dashboard.
[11495.50 → 11496.68] I'm not supposed to leak.
[11496.92 → 11498.32] And there's a number for you.
[11498.70 → 11503.06] I think if the new CEO wants to take down the WAN show, he's got another thing coming.
[11503.66 → 11506.26] Also, yes, I've done 630 merch messages today.
[11506.38 → 11506.64] Nice.
[11506.82 → 11507.68] He just doesn't care.
[11507.88 → 11508.48] He doesn't care.
[11508.72 → 11514.00] We can set up these like certain, like, oh, don't, don't reference this thing.
[11514.06 → 11514.94] Don't talk about this thing.
[11515.02 → 11515.76] Don't show this thing.
[11515.88 → 11516.68] It doesn't matter.
[11516.80 → 11521.26] At a certain point, I almost wonder, like, would we be better off just like not even telling
[11521.26 → 11522.58] him not to do certain things?
[11522.80 → 11526.12] Because like, I feel like it's, it's almost like, oh, that's a fun button to press.
[11526.36 → 11527.28] And it's like, darn it.
[11527.68 → 11529.52] Well, no, because he knows it upsets you.
[11529.76 → 11530.66] That's what I'm saying.
[11531.04 → 11531.74] That's my whole point.
[11531.86 → 11532.98] So stop getting upset.
[11533.84 → 11535.14] You're just giving a positive reinforcement.
[11535.34 → 11536.02] He's like a cat.
[11536.18 → 11536.94] I'm going to be upset.
[11537.52 → 11539.12] No, it's not time to play right now.
[11539.18 → 11540.44] Oh, you're going to scratch up the curtains.
[11540.76 → 11542.00] Is that going to get you to play with me?
[11543.90 → 11544.84] It's your fault, Luke.
[11544.94 → 11545.80] You're the bad parent.
[11546.14 → 11546.32] Yep.
[11547.00 → 11547.40] 100%.
[11547.40 → 11548.76] I mean, yeah, probably.
[11548.96 → 11549.70] I don't ever get it.
[11549.78 → 11550.76] Come on, leave me alone.
[11550.88 → 11551.10] Okay.
[11551.30 → 11551.94] Next, next one.
[11552.06 → 11552.42] Next one.
[11552.50 → 11552.76] Next one.
[11553.02 → 11553.22] All right.
[11553.28 → 11553.84] Same sort of vein.
[11553.84 → 11557.46] You've been doing the WAN show for quite a while.
[11557.62 → 11560.74] Do you see the WAN show outliving you two as hosts?
[11562.76 → 11567.40] You know, for a long time, we tried to have other people host the WAN show and it's okay.
[11568.26 → 11575.86] But I think the WAN show has changed from then and has become less of what it used to be.
[11575.94 → 11578.46] Like it used to be called weekly analysis and news.
[11578.58 → 11579.46] That was the joke.
[11579.46 → 11584.10] It was the WAN show because it was weekly analysis and news.
[11584.12 → 11585.80] No, it's weekly analysis and nukes.
[11586.02 → 11586.74] On a wide area.
[11586.86 → 11587.42] Got him!
[11588.98 → 11589.70] Let's go!
[11590.40 → 11591.10] Hell yeah.
[11591.52 → 11591.84] Sorry.
[11591.84 → 11595.54] That's what you get for showing the dashboard.
[11595.84 → 11600.90] And I thought it was hilarious because the name of our show was essentially just Internet Show.
[11601.56 → 11604.16] Because it's a wide area network show.
[11604.28 → 11604.54] Yes.
[11604.94 → 11608.16] So it's become less of weekly analysis and news.
[11608.30 → 11610.70] We've actually formally gotten rid of that name.
[11610.80 → 11612.76] And it now is just Internet Show.
[11613.12 → 11613.36] Yeah.
[11614.08 → 11615.82] It's Internet Show with Linus and Luke.
[11615.82 → 11621.12] I think that if we really had to, one of us could continue it without the other.
[11621.12 → 11624.94] But I honestly, I feel like...
[11624.94 → 11625.44] It'd be weird.
[11625.56 → 11635.18] I feel like even if I stepped back significantly, like in terms of time, I would probably still want to do WAN show.
[11635.98 → 11640.30] Because it's basically us just like shooting the s**t, which we would do anyway.
[11641.00 → 11644.84] And it's immensely profitable these days.
[11645.00 → 11647.08] Like WAN show made no sense for a long time.
[11647.18 → 11648.40] It was a complete waste of time.
[11648.40 → 11651.14] But we did it because the community seemed to like it.
[11651.24 → 11653.46] And it's always been fun for us.
[11654.08 → 11659.02] And nowadays, with merch messages, WAN show is like awesome.
[11659.22 → 11663.10] It's a huge shot in the arm for LTT Store.
[11663.60 → 11667.04] It's a great way to promote other initiatives that we have going on.
[11667.06 → 11672.36] Whether it's like Whale Land Party or LTX Expo or Labs or whatever.
[11672.36 → 11675.88] Yeah, it's kind of awesome, right?
[11675.98 → 11681.10] So if someone were to come to me and say, yeah, we need to get rid of WAN show, I'd be like, justify yourself, right?
[11681.50 → 11683.48] Like the burden of proof is on you now.
[11683.54 → 11686.46] Because WAN show has been working pretty well for a long time.
[11686.52 → 11688.82] I don't think Taryn would be stupid enough to do that, fortunately.
[11688.82 → 11691.30] So we'll never have to have that conversation.
[11691.30 → 11702.42] But it would raise serious questions for me about the competence of an executive that came to me and said, look, I think we need to get rid of WAN show.
[11703.70 → 11706.96] I mean, yeah, I caused some PR uproar or whatever else.
[11707.04 → 11707.70] But you know what they say.
[11707.76 → 11709.52] No publicity is bad publicity, right?
[11711.18 → 11712.80] It feels less true these days.
[11713.16 → 11713.46] Wait.
[11713.46 → 11716.26] Unless you get actually cancelled.
[11716.50 → 11716.60] Yeah.
[11716.60 → 11717.58] I don't.
[11717.70 → 11725.66] And I think it would be pretty hard to actually cancel me because you'd have to find something actually cancellable that I've done.
[11729.02 → 11731.96] There's not a House of Cards reference, by the way.
[11732.60 → 11734.10] Though it would have been very funny.
[11735.96 → 11736.84] Oh, okay.
[11736.90 → 11737.24] I get it.
[11737.24 → 11737.76] That took me a second.
[11737.78 → 11738.82] It's been a long time since I've shown.
[11739.58 → 11739.78] Yeah.
[11740.30 → 11740.86] What was I going to say?
[11740.86 → 11745.72] There are creators that have been what I would call like half cancelled.
[11746.70 → 11747.10] Yeah.
[11747.28 → 11751.46] Where like they're still around, but they're like a figment of what they used to be.
[11752.34 → 11753.28] A figment, you'd say.
[11753.62 → 11755.80] I questioned that immediately afterwards.
[11756.06 → 11756.14] Yeah.
[11757.14 → 11758.24] What does that mean?
[11758.84 → 11759.24] Figment?
[11759.38 → 11759.62] Yeah.
[11760.10 → 11763.76] I think it's just like an imagined, like a portion or something.
[11763.94 → 11766.04] Like, I think you were looking for like fraction.
[11766.48 → 11767.68] Oh, I definitely was.
[11767.78 → 11767.92] Yeah.
[11767.92 → 11768.78] I'm just now wondering.
[11768.78 → 11773.16] A figment is something formed from imaginary elements.
[11773.90 → 11774.28] There you go.
[11774.42 → 11774.58] Yeah.
[11774.62 → 11775.76] So that doesn't really work.
[11776.12 → 11776.76] But yeah.
[11778.94 → 11779.68] Hey, Dave.
[11779.90 → 11785.34] We got people talking about like how detrimental the backpack warranty controversy was.
[11785.44 → 11785.88] It wasn't.
[11785.90 → 11786.64] I don't think it was.
[11786.64 → 11796.22] It is like that's that's the thing that like is that the objective numbers were that there was a lot of highly visible outrage.
[11796.22 → 11800.60] But in the grand scheme of things, the impact was actually nothing.
[11800.60 → 11805.92] So like I just, I don't know.
[11805.92 → 11807.86] It's not that I'm trying to be dismissive.
[11807.92 → 11811.72] People's feelings about it were valid, and I did not do a good job of communicating it.
[11811.78 → 11813.32] There were definitely errors.
[11813.32 → 11818.88] But from like a business impact standpoint, if someone were to come to me and say, oh, good heavens, what if a trust me bro happens again?
[11818.92 → 11819.58] I'd be like, yeah.
[11819.66 → 11820.80] And whatever.
[11821.16 → 11821.50] Yeah.
[11821.52 → 11825.52] Then we'll, we'll address it, and we'll fix it and everything will be fine.
[11825.52 → 11826.44] Just like we always do.
[11826.68 → 11826.82] Yeah.
[11826.86 → 11829.08] Like that's our that's the whole trust me bro guarantee.
[11829.54 → 11830.38] We'll figure it out.
[11830.44 → 11830.92] We always do.
[11831.04 → 11833.24] We deal with some pretty mega fires here.
[11833.24 → 11838.18] Yeah, that was nothing unless the actual sky is falling like we'll be fine.
[11838.58 → 11844.64] Yeah, I'm far more concerned about what has appeared to be a significant algorithmic shift at YouTube in the last couple of weeks.
[11845.56 → 11855.30] We're we're seeing less sort of benefit from top performing videos for the rest of the catalogue compared to what I'm used to.
[11855.30 → 11857.30] Like if I look at the last 60 minutes right now.
[11857.30 → 11857.80] Now.
[11859.16 → 11860.66] Of it one.
[11861.28 → 11861.84] Oh, man.
[11861.96 → 11862.38] Wow.
[11862.86 → 11863.98] This is amazing.
[11864.56 → 11867.24] The top four and five.
[11867.34 → 11868.72] Number four and number five.
[11868.78 → 11871.10] Most viewed in the last 60 minutes here.
[11871.14 → 11872.14] Oh, no, this is 48 hours.
[11872.72 → 11874.06] OK, let's look at 60 minutes.
[11874.18 → 11874.30] Yeah.
[11874.40 → 11879.18] Top one and three is this WAN show and last week's WAN show.
[11879.18 → 11887.12] How is it even possible that last week's WAN show is in the top three most viewed in the last 60 minutes?
[11887.30 → 11898.60] How is it even possible that in the top 15, number 14 is a previous WAN show from like a month ago or something like that?
[11900.40 → 11903.74] What is going on with GOD discoverability right now?
[11903.74 → 11907.10] So I've been I've raised this to YouTube.
[11907.66 → 11913.40] But basically, videos are coming out, not even performing badly, necessarily.
[11913.40 → 11917.28] We've had a couple bombs in the last little while, one of which really shouldn't have been a bomb.
[11917.38 → 11923.96] That server video redoing the server room or whatever it was by every possible metric that I can access.
[11924.16 → 11927.30] Click through retention like dislike ratio.
[11927.30 → 11928.14] The retention is really strong.
[11928.14 → 11928.62] Engagement.
[11928.84 → 11930.52] It was all hyper strong.
[11930.64 → 11932.90] The video simply didn't get served.
[11933.90 → 11938.52] And as far as I and oh, this is another fascinating one.
[11938.94 → 11948.94] The'm stepping down video had basically zero knock on effect for the rest of the channel, which is not usually how that works.
[11948.94 → 11955.36] When someone watches a video, it's supposed to start recommending similar content, especially from that channel.
[11955.90 → 11960.86] That's a video that got four million views or something stupid like that in a day.
[11961.50 → 11966.44] And it's had no impact whatsoever on back catalogue viewership.
[11966.50 → 11968.14] That's definitely broken.
[11968.14 → 11970.40] Is it unique to us?
[11970.48 → 11972.10] Is it something that's changed overall?
[11972.26 → 11972.74] I don't know.
[11972.84 → 11976.04] But, you know, you have to flag these things and kind of go, hey, this doesn't make any sense.
[11976.66 → 11981.40] And that's not to say that I'm just going to, you know, whine about low viewership.
[11981.56 → 11984.70] Obviously, we're just going to do our best to make the best content we can every day.
[11984.78 → 11988.76] And we're not going to we're not going to we're not going to go down without a fight.
[11988.76 → 11997.50] But when there's anything that looks like this or like this always makes me suspicious.
[11997.50 → 12001.74] I also report it to YouTube when I feel like something unnaturally positive happened.
[12001.98 → 12007.76] Hey, for some reason, we are swimming hard with the current right now.
[12007.84 → 12014.28] Like this was a kind of crap video, and it had almost no impact on the overall viewership of the channel.
[12014.28 → 12022.18] Like it just is going hard right now or it just makes no sense.
[12022.92 → 12025.30] And these algorithmic shifts, they happen.
[12025.48 → 12026.98] They happen all the time, right?
[12026.98 → 12038.44] Like you'll go from uploading a sponsored showcase that gets a million and a half views to uploading an absolute banger of a unique creative video that gets 1.1.
[12038.94 → 12039.16] Right.
[12039.18 → 12040.78] Like it's all over the place.
[12040.78 → 12044.66] And yeah, we'll figure it out.
[12045.56 → 12049.60] Mr. Foo drama says my recommended videos past few weeks have been of zero interest to me.
[12049.90 → 12050.62] You know, I don't know.
[12051.20 → 12053.24] And that's the thing is that's an individual person.
[12053.36 → 12059.42] Even Google's engineers, though, don't fully understand how their recommendation machine learning engines work.
[12059.96 → 12061.36] That's kind of the nature of it.
[12061.40 → 12063.76] They feed it what they want the desired outcome to be.
[12063.80 → 12064.28] And it shifts.
[12064.38 → 12064.88] It morphs.
[12064.88 → 12066.02] So.
[12068.76 → 12069.18] Oh, OK.
[12069.46 → 12072.68] Nighttime Astronaut says YouTube is definitely moving against older videos.
[12072.90 → 12075.46] ZEF Frank Animal Facts posted about it this week, too.
[12075.94 → 12077.88] That doesn't definitely mean anything.
[12078.26 → 12079.54] It could be niche specific.
[12079.76 → 12081.34] It could be creator specific.
[12081.34 → 12089.74] What I do know is that live is handled differently algorithmically.
[12090.26 → 12102.70] And so the fact that all of a sudden live streams are just dramatically disproportionately represented in recent views.
[12102.70 → 12111.86] Like this recent, the last 60 minutes should be predominantly videos we just published because they won't have dropped off as much yet.
[12112.40 → 12126.52] The fact that of these 15, one, two, three, four of them are live streams is wild.
[12126.94 → 12127.02] Yeah.
[12127.02 → 12130.66] When's the last time we did a live stream other than WAN show?
[12131.44 → 12141.72] Why is it that some stupid live stream building a computer from four weeks ago is getting more videos right now in this or more views right now at this moment than a video we published like four days ago?
[12142.94 → 12151.68] That should be literally impossible, especially if that video from four days ago has much better engagement, much better retention, much better everything.
[12151.78 → 12153.24] You should be feeding them something good.
[12153.24 → 12162.04] But just because they are completely different search and discovery teams, they behave really differently.
[12162.18 → 12163.60] And I can't explain it.
[12167.40 → 12167.88] Okay.
[12167.98 → 12168.48] Here we go.
[12168.58 → 12169.02] Another one.
[12169.52 → 12169.90] Hey, DLL.
[12170.08 → 12174.06] I appreciate how much work the team does to create great content all year round.
[12174.52 → 12178.80] Has LTT Labs always been one of the end goals or vision for LTT?
[12179.16 → 12181.10] Or when did that really come to be?
[12181.10 → 12181.16] Great.
[12182.34 → 12188.46] Man, the five-year plan was like me and some bros making tech videos, and hopefully we can all get paid a living wage.
[12189.28 → 12190.44] We talked about that a lot.
[12190.64 → 12190.90] Yeah.
[12191.60 → 12193.68] I had no idea.
[12196.88 → 12197.72] Hi, all.
[12197.92 → 12200.54] I'm totally qualified to be a chief vision officer, obviously.
[12202.04 → 12204.18] I mean, it's a vision for six months out.
[12204.24 → 12205.04] That's good enough for us.
[12205.66 → 12206.26] Hi, all.
[12206.32 → 12209.86] Linus, what's the best memory you've made with your Taiwan thus far?
[12209.86 → 12210.06] Sure.
[12210.72 → 12214.34] How about the one where I was actually able to drive it?
[12215.00 → 12220.34] It's been in the shop for like three weeks, the first two of which they couldn't even be arsed to give me a courtesy car.
[12221.14 → 12225.26] I got into it one morning, and it just said like battery error or something.
[12225.36 → 12225.54] I don't know.
[12225.58 → 12231.26] I took a picture of it and basically send it to the dealership, and they're like, yep, needs to be towed.
[12231.26 → 12232.26] Okay.
[12234.26 → 12245.08] And then I heard back, you know, relatively quickly, I guess, to their credit that no, I would not be getting a courtesy car because they would rather give me nothing than give me something that isn't a Porsche.
[12245.08 → 12248.08] So have them on hand.
[12248.08 → 12248.76] Yeah.
[12248.76 → 12248.86] Yeah.
[12249.86 → 12250.54] Okay.
[12251.10 → 12251.70] Sure.
[12252.02 → 12263.16] Imagine being that far up your own butthole that you would rather say f*** you to a customer than just anyway.
[12263.16 → 12263.24] Okay.
[12263.24 → 12274.72] And then I heard back that they apparently do not have a it's a bad cell, and they do not have a single replacement cell on the entire f***ING continent.
[12275.06 → 12277.28] So they need to bring one in from Germany.
[12277.28 → 12285.92] And the ETA that I was given after the diagnosis was three weeks, which I think were, I don't know, two weeks into or something like that.
[12285.92 → 12290.44] All these, don't take these numbers as, you know, gospel truth or anything like that.
[12290.48 → 12291.78] But yeah, I've been driving the Volt again.
[12292.00 → 12293.86] So cool.
[12296.04 → 12297.00] Good job.
[12297.10 → 12298.26] Good job, Porsche.
[12298.44 → 12299.40] Great experience.
[12299.78 → 12303.54] You definitely shouldn't have replacement parts on hand to fix your cars.
[12303.70 → 12304.72] That would be stupid.
[12307.28 → 12309.66] You know what's really crazy about like my old car?
[12311.44 → 12312.48] It just always works.
[12313.24 → 12313.60] Yeah.
[12313.78 → 12314.22] It's always fine.
[12314.24 → 12315.02] I mean, it's a Honda.
[12315.24 → 12315.44] Yeah.
[12315.94 → 12316.44] So like.
[12316.62 → 12316.84] Yeah.
[12317.22 → 12318.10] What do you want, a cookie?
[12318.50 → 12319.46] Yeah, I want my Honda.
[12319.46 → 12321.56] You chose a cookie, so you are a smart shopper?
[12321.68 → 12321.90] Yes.
[12322.52 → 12322.88] All right.
[12326.88 → 12333.38] How would past Linus, back when you all worked out of one room, react to what LTT has become today?
[12333.38 → 12338.34] What would he think about screwdriver, backpack labs, and all of that?
[12338.54 → 12339.38] Oh, I'd be mind blown.
[12339.50 → 12340.72] I'd just be in like geek heaven.
[12340.96 → 12341.24] Yeah.
[12341.42 → 12344.08] I'd be like, whoa, I want to work here.
[12344.62 → 12346.22] What I'm doing right now sucks.
[12347.34 → 12349.10] I have to be in the same room as Luke.
[12349.10 → 12355.56] I think I'd be really surprised and also not surprised at what I'm doing.
[12356.76 → 12358.12] I'd be like, wait, really?
[12359.60 → 12361.56] How did I end up there?
[12362.04 → 12363.42] I stayed here for that long?
[12363.48 → 12364.42] Why did I take, yeah.
[12364.94 → 12366.48] That's actually not too surprising to me.
[12367.26 → 12368.20] Once we, like.
[12369.04 → 12372.98] I bounced around jobs a lot when I was growing up, but I think that's pretty normal.
[12373.14 → 12375.06] Like you do a different job basically every summer.
[12376.14 → 12378.42] I had tons of random odd jobs and stuff like that.
[12378.44 → 12381.96] But once we started on this road, I was like, yeah, this is what I want to do.
[12382.38 → 12384.54] Something in this realm is what I want to do.
[12384.86 → 12386.80] And I've known that for like a long time.
[12387.78 → 12390.24] Like we had conversations like a really long time ago.
[12390.52 → 12392.64] Well, I was worried it would be a retention problem with you.
[12392.64 → 12392.94] Pretty long did.
[12393.20 → 12393.42] Yeah.
[12393.74 → 12394.82] Because like, what were you going to do?
[12394.86 → 12396.42] Just be like a script assistant forever?
[12396.54 → 12397.26] Like that wasn't going to work.
[12397.26 → 12397.68] That was weird.
[12397.96 → 12398.16] Yeah.
[12398.26 → 12399.18] It didn't make any sense.
[12399.38 → 12399.56] Yeah.
[12399.56 → 12400.02] I needed to.
[12400.06 → 12400.98] What the hell were you thinking?
[12401.56 → 12402.02] I don't know.
[12403.88 → 12407.04] I still don't have an answer for this, but like I saw something.
[12407.44 → 12407.98] I don't know.
[12408.64 → 12410.40] I was pretty confident the whole time.
[12410.40 → 12413.04] I'm glad you didn't imagine it because it could have easily gone the other way.
[12413.30 → 12415.94] It's like Yvonne, her bet on marrying me.
[12416.42 → 12417.44] Not a good gamble.
[12417.80 → 12420.40] I wouldn't, I wouldn't tell my kids to make the same bet.
[12421.18 → 12422.52] Like your parents were right.
[12422.52 → 12423.42] You were insane.
[12423.42 → 12423.72] Yeah.
[12423.72 → 12424.64] Yeah.
[12424.64 → 12430.78] The fact that it worked out is not a testament to your incredible, you know, divination skills.
[12430.92 → 12431.10] Yeah.
[12431.40 → 12432.86] You were an idiot and got lucky.
[12433.08 → 12435.62] Well, see, I don't 100% agree.
[12436.02 → 12436.80] I don't know.
[12436.86 → 12438.04] I feel like that sometimes.
[12438.04 → 12443.12] I feel like that's sometimes to be fair, but I don't think it's that simple is what I think I'm saying.
[12443.38 → 12446.74] Because the team that we had were all insane.
[12446.90 → 12454.50] And when you have a group of insane people that are all at an age where they are able to put in infinite energy.
[12454.74 → 12455.18] Yeah.
[12455.18 → 12458.10] And sleep for like two hours and then get up and keep going and all this kind of stuff.
[12458.10 → 12460.16] You can make some pretty crazy things happen.
[12460.74 → 12465.86] And like that, like first CES era level of effort.
[12466.98 → 12474.34] If I look at a group of people that has that level of effort and that like it's never questioned willingness to input it.
[12475.24 → 12485.32] And they're on a path of a new type of platform or thing that people are using that is like clearly trending to be the norm of how people use stuff.
[12485.44 → 12486.58] I'd bet on that again.
[12486.58 → 12488.46] Yeah, but clearly trending is like.
[12488.98 → 12490.58] YouTube was going to be a thing.
[12490.68 → 12491.48] Oh, yeah.
[12492.30 → 12492.74] Yes.
[12493.00 → 12493.90] Guaranteed at that point.
[12494.88 → 12495.28] Okay.
[12495.80 → 12497.82] Guaranteed is such a big word in tech.
[12498.10 → 12500.42] Online video was going to be a thing.
[12502.34 → 12504.32] But we could have easily made the wrong bets.
[12504.46 → 12506.34] What if we had bet big on Periscope?
[12507.40 → 12507.62] Yeah.
[12508.34 → 12508.62] Right?
[12508.76 → 12509.20] We could have.
[12509.32 → 12512.10] It could have stunted our growth at the very least.
[12512.40 → 12512.70] Yes.
[12512.90 → 12514.16] But I don't think it would have killed us.
[12514.16 → 12516.78] You see like a lot of the big Vine creators.
[12516.94 → 12518.12] Everyone just ends up on YouTube.
[12518.50 → 12520.62] A lot of the big Vine creators.
[12520.76 → 12522.14] A lot of the big Periscope creators.
[12522.22 → 12523.10] I don't know how many of those there were.
[12523.46 → 12527.06] A lot of the big whatever were able to transition over to another platform.
[12527.06 → 12529.06] Yeah, a lot of Twitch creators have made it over to YouTube.
[12529.30 → 12532.08] I think YouTube is still where people see the end game.
[12532.16 → 12532.58] The end game.
[12532.64 → 12532.78] Yeah.
[12532.78 → 12534.60] Sometimes there is a hit for sure.
[12534.90 → 12536.38] But you see like the Paul brothers.
[12537.32 → 12537.44] Yeah.
[12537.44 → 12539.50] They came over to YouTube from Vine, I think.
[12539.62 → 12540.20] I think it was Vine.
[12540.20 → 12541.00] And then just exploded.
[12541.16 → 12541.84] Thanks for that, Vine.
[12542.08 → 12542.32] Yeah.
[12542.76 → 12544.94] Like it's not the end of it.
[12545.10 → 12545.66] So I don't know.
[12545.74 → 12551.30] When I see that level of like passion, level of investment, level of like complete disregard
[12551.30 → 12554.96] for basically everything except for like push forward as hard as you can.
[12554.96 → 12559.86] In an industry that is like clearly growing and extremely quickly.
[12560.02 → 12560.20] Yeah.
[12560.44 → 12561.52] I'd make that bet again.
[12562.02 → 12566.40] So like, no, I don't know exactly what I saw, but I saw the team and that was kind of enough.
[12569.02 → 12569.84] Howdy you all.
[12570.08 → 12574.38] With the new move to the CVO position, how have you prepared yourself to have an answer
[12574.38 → 12577.72] to a supervisor after being the CEO for so long?
[12577.88 → 12579.66] What happens when there are disagreements?
[12580.16 → 12581.38] It's going to be really hard.
[12581.70 → 12581.80] Yeah.
[12581.80 → 12586.12] I haven't had a boss in like as long as my children have been alive.
[12589.02 → 12596.36] I mean, in general, I think my management style is pretty, let's try to reach a consensus.
[12597.14 → 12600.74] I'm probably right because I have more experience in this than you do.
[12603.00 → 12609.90] But it's not my job to just say I'm right and then go forward because then we've basically
[12609.90 → 12612.76] we've basically splintered at that point.
[12613.40 → 12618.30] And to come back together, we will have to we will have to undo this damage that's
[12618.30 → 12618.72] been done.
[12618.82 → 12623.66] And if we continue to splinter, and we continue to go further and further on our separate
[12623.66 → 12628.34] paths in terms of our understanding of what's best for the company, then eventually it becomes
[12628.34 → 12629.28] irreconcilable.
[12629.28 → 12629.56] Right.
[12630.00 → 12637.18] So what I like to believe is that I try to reach a consensus.
[12637.64 → 12644.58] And if we can't, I try to evaluate what the risk is of doing it the other way.
[12645.62 → 12647.20] If it's not super high, allow failure.
[12647.34 → 12648.04] Allow failure.
[12648.18 → 12648.40] Yep.
[12648.40 → 12658.18] I try to or if not just the risk, or I try to also evaluate how staunchly each party
[12658.18 → 12660.42] believes in their particular path forward.
[12660.42 → 12666.60] If is I can is I'm getting the vibe that they're kind of 60 percent on it, and I am 99 percent
[12666.60 → 12670.82] sure, then I might say, OK, you really don't seem to have that much conviction.
[12671.22 → 12673.00] I think we should probably just do it this way.
[12673.00 → 12678.66] Or if they are adamant, and I am honestly not that sure, then even if it is moderate risk,
[12678.68 → 12679.82] maybe we do try to do it that way.
[12679.86 → 12681.60] It's kind of how I've always tried to do things.
[12683.22 → 12688.38] I'm not always perfect at it, but I'd like to think that I'm well-prepared to continue
[12688.38 → 12691.50] to manage like that and be managed like that.
[12692.92 → 12698.48] Hey, Linus, we're all putting a lot of hope and trust in the CEO since he was your boss.
[12698.48 → 12702.90] Can you share something that he taught young Linus that left a lasting impact?
[12703.00 → 12706.14] Oh, man.
[12707.68 → 12715.88] And he was perfect at sort of, you know, pushing me to get stuff done.
[12716.94 → 12720.66] Don't agonize over, you know, every line on a PO.
[12721.38 → 12726.08] The big picture is, you know, making sure that everything's everything's getting done on time.
[12726.08 → 12734.38] You know, it's a huge part of our corporate philosophy these days is ship something, right?
[12734.50 → 12737.76] Like get something out there, and you can always iterate.
[12738.76 → 12740.22] But don't just stand still.
[12740.22 → 12751.32] I wasn't always, I wasn't always the best when it came to honesty and integrity.
[12751.32 → 12754.20] I've always been like a hustler, a boundary pusher.
[12754.20 → 12770.26] And I'd say that, you know, one chat in particular that Taryn had with me early on about some company gear that I requisitioned that probably shouldn't have really set me straight on that.
[12770.26 → 12784.20] You know, he found out I was like using something that I shouldn't have been using because there wasn't really any financial justification for it for the company.
[12784.34 → 12786.08] I was just, I wanted to play with it.
[12786.08 → 12791.12] And he was like, hey, no one else knows about this.
[12791.70 → 12792.92] He didn't rat me out.
[12793.04 → 12795.12] He just kind of sat me down and talked to me about it.
[12795.16 → 12796.38] And I really appreciated that.
[12797.66 → 12800.80] No, it wasn't a swing line stapler, but good joke.
[12801.14 → 12802.04] I got that reference.
[12805.30 → 12808.28] Okay, so that's all I've got for Curated.
[12808.42 → 12810.46] So shall we start going through some of these potentials?
[12811.66 → 12812.06] Sure.
[12813.16 → 12815.22] Okay, I think I'm going to go straight from the bottom.
[12816.08 → 12817.84] Hey, all for career growth.
[12817.94 → 12821.24] Do you recommend linear growth or diagonal growth between areas?
[12821.42 → 12824.26] I am finishing university this year and work in tech.
[12824.46 → 12829.06] Stability of income and maximizing income seem to be at odds.
[12830.04 → 12832.16] I don't think there's any one right answer.
[12832.28 → 12834.48] You kind of have to do something that you want to do.
[12834.56 → 12836.44] I mean, this comes back to what I was saying earlier.
[12836.76 → 12841.32] Maybe my philosophy is that you should make a place that's, you know, great to work.
[12841.32 → 12846.22] And that that has a value because that has a value to me.
[12846.44 → 12848.70] I would pass a certain point.
[12848.94 → 12852.10] Obviously, you need enough money to survive.
[12852.42 → 12859.06] But past a certain point, I would rather go do something that is not soul sucking, even if it means less money.
[12859.06 → 12868.58] And fortunately, I found a way to turn my passion into something into more money.
[12868.82 → 12873.56] But you'll never do that if you don't pursue something you're legitimately passionate about.
[12873.56 → 12879.12] But anyone can end up in a dead end job.
[12879.20 → 12882.94] Anyone can make a mistake, whether they go vertical, whether they go diagonal.
[12883.14 → 12883.28] Right.
[12883.34 → 12888.64] Like I had a family member who was, you know, it's a classic story.
[12888.70 → 12888.92] Right.
[12889.00 → 12892.70] Middle aged man been doing the same thing forever.
[12892.70 → 12897.76] And that industry declined, and they just became utterly unemployable.
[12898.58 → 12902.50] And whether their experience was broad or narrow.
[12904.24 → 12905.48] That's a thing, man.
[12905.74 → 12906.10] That's.
[12907.38 → 12910.76] Yeah, there's no such there's no such thing as a stable job.
[12910.84 → 12912.78] I mean, just look at the rise of AI, right?
[12912.92 → 12913.30] Oh, yeah.
[12913.46 → 12919.58] Jobs we thought were safe for another 50 years are all of a sudden at risk in the next five years.
[12919.58 → 12932.02] There's a there's a fun thing going around where people are talking about like we always knew AI was going to take our jobs, but we were hoping it would take the like rough jobs that no one wants to do.
[12932.50 → 12940.68] Modern AI is sitting here making art and music and all these like creative endeavours that are more fun for people.
[12940.76 → 12941.76] And it's like this gross.
[12943.76 → 12944.20] Yeah.
[12944.20 → 12949.96] Another thing I would mention what you were just talking about is to not get complacent.
[12950.76 → 12953.98] I think making just enough money to be fine.
[12955.36 → 12964.96] So deciding to not really worry about skill development or anything else because you're like, okay, right now or whatever is potentially attractive because it takes less energy and whatnot.
[12964.96 → 12968.84] But is a really, terrible idea.
[12968.96 → 12973.42] If you look at the modern, you know.
[12974.42 → 12982.60] How much people make over time versus how much costs are going up over time, that is not a fun scenario to be in.
[12982.82 → 12984.88] So you got to try to keep pushing.
[12984.88 → 13002.02] Try to learn new skills, try to diversify your portfolio of skills so that if AI automates your job or if is your industry becomes irrelevant for different reasons or whatever else, you can kind of go with the flow a little bit easier.
[13002.02 → 13017.86] And also try to seek excellence or specializations in some of those fields so that you can have career advancement to keep pushing, keep pushing further because life's hard.
[13018.96 → 13019.06] Yeah.
[13021.46 → 13029.52] Linus, with you being a lifeguard in your past, did you know, or how do you feel about the minimum age for lifeguarding possibly being lower?
[13030.12 → 13031.80] Sounds like a cost-cutting measure to me.
[13032.58 → 13044.02] Did you know that in BC, we used to have a what was called a training wage, which was a lower minimum wage for workers who were just entering the workforce?
[13044.02 → 13047.24] I think it was your first I forget how many hours it was.
[13047.86 → 13049.30] But it was a lot.
[13049.46 → 13052.14] It was not insignificant number of hours.
[13052.56 → 13055.98] But our minimum wage was eight dollars, I think, at the time.
[13055.98 → 13060.40] And the training wage was six dollars or like six dollars and change.
[13060.40 → 13064.68] And this was like not that long ago.
[13064.76 → 13067.16] I'm not talking six dollars an hour in 1975.
[13067.34 → 13070.04] I'm talking six dollars an hour in like 2004.
[13070.52 → 13070.66] Yeah.
[13070.84 → 13072.24] I had multiple of these.
[13072.54 → 13072.74] Yeah.
[13072.74 → 13082.72] So what I assume is that this is just a way to bring in younger, less experienced people so they don't have to pay them as much.
[13083.18 → 13091.28] And I will also say that I don't think that most people are physically developed enough under 16 is the age here.
[13091.28 → 13100.16] So under 16, you're you're telling me that some 15 or 14-year-old is going to pulse like somewhat some deadweight passed out person out of a pool.
[13100.22 → 13101.02] Are you kidding me?
[13101.56 → 13106.74] I mean, Luke and I have talked extensively off stream about things like standards for firefighters.
[13106.74 → 13117.22] And like because is it known what cold SC is up to these days or is it like I don't think there's any issue with talking about it.
[13117.34 → 13121.76] My brother has been trying to become a firefighter for a long time.
[13121.82 → 13123.34] It's a very difficult thing to get into.
[13124.38 → 13127.94] Some amount of that is like need to know the right people, which is unfortunate.
[13127.94 → 13129.62] But that's true for a lot of industries.
[13130.22 → 13131.66] But he got in.
[13132.06 → 13132.18] Yeah.
[13132.34 → 13133.80] But some firefighter, and he's killing it.
[13134.06 → 13149.84] But some part of it is also just like the fact that standards have been adjusted to make it easier for certain people to get into firefighting, which inherently makes it more difficult for other people to get into firefighting.
[13149.84 → 13167.32] And, you know, without putting myself, you know, at risk of being cancelled here, if someone is I'm like passed out in a burning building from smoke inhalation, I want the hugest, most like jacked dude to be whose job it is to come in and get me.
[13168.34 → 13169.26] No question.
[13169.26 → 13177.50] And if you're going to relax these standards for carry strength and stuff like that, you better have a perfect reason.
[13177.50 → 13181.14] The yeah, I don't I don't care whatsoever about.
[13183.60 → 13194.78] Yeah, I don't think the requirements of what you can do should change, but I don't care who the heck it is.
[13195.24 → 13195.36] Yeah.
[13195.80 → 13197.20] Hundred percent don't care.
[13197.50 → 13200.06] But you better be able to, like, get me out of there.
[13200.16 → 13201.00] And not just me.
[13201.10 → 13202.94] Like, that's the thing is when it comes to safety.
[13203.18 → 13204.96] I think you used dude as like person.
[13205.20 → 13205.44] Yeah.
[13205.44 → 13208.46] But some people are going to interpret that as sure.
[13208.92 → 13210.80] So he doesn't care what gender the person.
[13210.80 → 13215.60] I don't care about anything other than whether it's me or like Luke.
[13216.26 → 13217.26] I'm a big boy.
[13217.26 → 13217.96] I'm a big boy.
[13218.28 → 13220.92] You got to be able to you got to be able to move the hoses.
[13221.06 → 13223.76] Have you ever actually tried to, like, carry a firefighting hose?
[13223.86 → 13224.40] It's really hard.
[13224.78 → 13225.96] Like for real.
[13226.54 → 13230.62] And those are, but those are like I don't decide how much they weigh.
[13230.74 → 13232.34] They just weigh how much they weigh.
[13232.34 → 13240.46] I don't decide how how how hard it is to, you know, perform CPR on someone.
[13240.58 → 13244.44] If you don't have the physical stamina to do it, then you ought not be a lifeguard.
[13245.54 → 13245.98] Sorry.
[13247.20 → 13248.16] Like, I don't know.
[13248.20 → 13250.54] I talked about this a fair bit at some point.
[13250.60 → 13251.62] I don't know if it was on WAN show.
[13251.62 → 13258.62] But the moment the wake-up call for me when I realized that, no, not everybody can do anything they want.
[13258.98 → 13265.22] Not everybody can do any job was when I wanted to be on the rowing team, and they wanted me to be a coxswain and I wanted to row.
[13265.78 → 13267.96] And one of my friends, bless his heart.
[13268.20 → 13271.96] Thank you for your brutal honesty, was like, are you kidding me?
[13272.00 → 13274.36] I'm like six two, and I'm barely tall enough to be a rower.
[13274.36 → 13276.08] And I'm like, oh, right.
[13277.78 → 13280.90] No, you actually can't just do anything you want.
[13281.02 → 13287.70] And sometimes there are actual requirements of a job or of a role that are not flexible.
[13288.50 → 13292.96] And to me, no, being able to carry someone out of a building is just sort of a requirement.
[13292.96 → 13295.30] If you want to be a firefighter, shout out firefighters, by the way.
[13295.44 → 13296.62] And I'm just reiterating.
[13296.76 → 13299.02] He was using dude in a general neutral.
[13299.02 → 13299.96] I call everyone dude.
[13300.04 → 13301.54] I literally call my wife man.
[13302.34 → 13305.66] She denies it, or she denied it until I proved it.
[13305.94 → 13309.94] I was like, yeah, I call you man all the time because we were having an unrelated conversation.
[13309.94 → 13312.74] And I was like, yeah, I just call everyone man now because it's just easier.
[13312.92 → 13314.22] And she's like, you do not.
[13314.42 → 13315.16] And I'm like, yeah, I do.
[13315.22 → 13316.00] She's like, no, you don't.
[13316.04 → 13316.98] I'm like, I do it to you.
[13317.06 → 13318.24] She's like, no, you don't.
[13318.24 → 13321.16] And then she was like, you totally don't.
[13321.20 → 13321.76] I'm like, yeah, I do.
[13321.96 → 13327.92] And then I basically said, OK, I'll tell you what, I'll point it out next time I do it.
[13327.92 → 13330.78] Because I don't even think about it, but I'll try to think about it.
[13330.78 → 13331.78] I'll point it out next time I do it.
[13331.80 → 13333.16] It was like two hours later or something.
[13333.82 → 13334.94] We were on the way home.
[13334.98 → 13335.92] I was like, yeah, I don't know, man.
[13335.94 → 13337.04] It's just like a weird thing.
[13337.46 → 13337.88] And I waited.
[13338.52 → 13340.12] Two, three, four, five steamboats.
[13340.16 → 13341.02] Hey, there, I just did it.
[13341.12 → 13341.68] She's like, what?
[13341.84 → 13342.74] I was like, I called you man.
[13342.86 → 13344.46] She's like, oh, yeah, you did.
[13344.64 → 13345.36] Didn't notice at all.
[13345.44 → 13346.12] I'm like, yeah, of course not.
[13346.16 → 13346.48] Who cares?
[13346.48 → 13346.72] Yeah.
[13349.90 → 13352.50] I just I know someone's going to try to run with it.
[13352.56 → 13353.96] So I was just trying to re-clarify.
[13355.08 → 13356.78] OK, I've got a couple more here to go.
[13356.78 → 13361.62] So, hey, DLL, with every TV manufacturer or Google TV putting more and more ads in their
[13361.62 → 13365.86] software, are there any good self-hosted HTPC interfaces?
[13366.16 → 13367.36] Actually, can I back up for a second?
[13367.50 → 13367.76] Uh-oh.
[13368.60 → 13369.20] But yes.
[13369.28 → 13373.42] The solution is people are talking about like lifeguards and stuff still in the chat.
[13373.50 → 13377.44] The solution, if you can't find enough people to meet the standards, is to pay more.
[13378.32 → 13378.66] Yeah.
[13378.86 → 13380.34] That's the actual solution.
[13380.64 → 13381.24] Anyway, go ahead.
[13381.26 → 13381.66] Oh, my God.
[13381.66 → 13382.62] That's a great take.
[13382.62 → 13386.70] Or, or make it a kick-ass job.
[13388.56 → 13389.38] Lifeguard snacks.
[13389.84 → 13390.28] Yeah.
[13390.84 → 13391.38] Lifeguard snacks.
[13391.40 → 13392.10] So terrifying.
[13392.68 → 13393.72] Oh, I hate it.
[13393.82 → 13395.12] OK, don't talk about that anymore.
[13395.46 → 13399.58] Hey, DLL, with every TV manufacturer, Google TV, putting more and more ads in their software,
[13400.06 → 13401.46] the building's about to alarm itself.
[13402.00 → 13405.26] Are there any good self-hosted, can I do this at the same time?
[13405.32 → 13405.72] It's over there.
[13405.72 → 13411.72] Uh, HTPC, YouTube, Netflix, MB, Plex, etc. rip Windows Media Centre.
[13413.78 → 13416.52] Uh, man, I don't know.
[13416.62 → 13421.06] I mean, you, you talked about Plex already, but I don't think Plex like integrates your
[13421.06 → 13423.42] Netflix account or anything.
[13423.52 → 13425.54] I'm not really sure quite what you're asking.
[13426.06 → 13427.08] Did you disable it?
[13427.08 → 13427.74] Well, I think so.
[13428.22 → 13430.18] I will go, and I'm doing it.
[13430.28 → 13430.90] No, it's doing it.
[13431.00 → 13431.62] Mine's doing it.
[13431.72 → 13431.88] OK.
[13432.62 → 13433.32] You're on the right building?
[13433.42 → 13433.96] I mean, it's still beeping.
[13434.22 → 13435.44] Yeah, I'm on the right building, I think.
[13436.22 → 13436.68] I think so.
[13437.44 → 13438.10] I mean, what do I know?
[13438.12 → 13439.10] I'm not even CEO anymore.
[13439.18 → 13440.52] How am I supposed to not arm the building?
[13441.12 → 13441.50] There we go.
[13441.52 → 13441.72] That's good.
[13443.80 → 13444.62] I don't know.
[13444.96 → 13445.68] I use Plex.
[13446.08 → 13446.96] It's all right.
[13448.96 → 13449.24] Nice.
[13449.24 → 13452.16] And last one I've got today.
[13452.74 → 13453.52] Hi, LLD.
[13453.80 → 13458.92] Over the years of WAN shows, I have heard nods to many leadership models, e.g. Simon Sink,
[13459.50 → 13460.46] Infinite Game.
[13460.86 → 13463.06] What leadership minds have inspired you?
[13463.20 → 13465.24] What philosophies have you invented?
[13465.70 → 13468.74] Not going to lie, I have no idea what the f*** I'm talking about.
[13468.76 → 13470.88] I'm so happy you feel the same way.
[13471.48 → 13474.16] I read this, and I was like, oh boy.
[13475.04 → 13477.04] I assumed that you would.
[13477.04 → 13481.86] I've read some books that Wendell recommended me and none of them have mentioned that, but
[13481.86 → 13482.90] they've been great books.
[13483.00 → 13484.02] Thank you very much, Wendell.
[13484.20 → 13488.50] I am excited to go to Computer and hang out with Wendell so he can tell me more things.
[13488.76 → 13495.96] I read some of The Innovator's Dilemma, most of which I had pretty much kind of figured
[13495.96 → 13496.24] out.
[13496.36 → 13499.80] There were some sorts of, oh yeah, okay, like moments in it.
[13501.06 → 13506.72] I read Good to Great, I think, or like some of Good to Great, which really only seemed
[13506.72 → 13511.16] applicable to public companies and like maximizing shareholder value.
[13511.38 → 13517.28] A lot of times when I read this kind of books, they're either like, yeah, f***ING obviously,
[13517.76 → 13523.96] or it's like you're saying maximizing returns for shareholders or like some type of thing
[13523.96 → 13525.18] where it's like, this isn't how we work.
[13525.24 → 13529.08] There's more to greatness than just maximizing your share price.
[13529.08 → 13535.16] A lot of the ones in the tech space are all built around like preparing your company to
[13535.16 → 13538.44] try to sell it to someone else, which is like, yeah, it's not the goal.
[13538.78 → 13538.96] Yeah.
[13539.14 → 13544.86] So for me, it's just like what gets us best to sustainability.
[13546.82 → 13547.26] Yeah.
[13547.26 → 13553.08] So if you, if I have any, if, if anything I've talked about bears any accidental resemblance
[13553.08 → 13561.72] to Simon Sink, then I guess shout out, shout out Simon for being apparently awesome.
[13562.52 → 13564.72] And I guess shout out me for figuring it out too.
[13564.80 → 13565.30] I don't know.
[13566.38 → 13567.24] I'm not sure.
[13568.06 → 13568.66] Cool though.
[13569.66 → 13571.88] What if the new CEO will stop you from being who you are?
[13571.92 → 13573.10] I was typing your response to that.
[13573.10 → 13574.24] I don't know.
[13574.42 → 13577.38] When it comes to business, he like made me a lot of who I am.
[13577.42 → 13578.22] So I'm not too worried about that.
[13578.28 → 13579.18] He still owns the company.
[13579.68 → 13580.24] Yeah, that too.
[13581.54 → 13584.14] And I own the end of this show.
[13584.44 → 13585.50] I'll see you again next week.
[13585.70 → 13586.26] Same bad time.
[13586.34 → 13586.86] Same bad channel.
[13587.94 → 13588.30] Bye.
[13588.86 → 13590.32] The CEO will never stop me.
[13590.92 → 13592.14] Oh, okay.
[13594.28 → 13596.84] We need to do something about that.
[13598.50 → 13599.36] Uh, okay.
[13599.46 → 13600.12] That's a problem.
[13601.86 → 13602.60] Oh no.
[13603.10 → 13608.58] You can watch it really slowly.
[13608.58 → 13608.62] You can watch it really slowly.
