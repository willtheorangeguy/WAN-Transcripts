[0.00 --> 4.62]  What is up everyone? Welcome to the WAN show! Oh, sorry, I should be quiet. Luke's not feeling well.
[5.18 --> 7.20]  Yeah, so you have to whisper around me.
[7.68 --> 13.84]  Intel's branding got even dumber. It's sort of amazing. We'll be talking about that.
[13.96 --> 18.02]  It's been a heck of a week in AI. We're going to be talking about that as well.
[18.30 --> 21.82]  Luke's going to get all caught up because he has spent the week sleeping.
[22.22 --> 23.72]  What else are we going to talk about today, Luke?
[23.84 --> 27.48]  The escapist. They all escaped. They're gone.
[27.48 --> 31.36]  I don't know all the details behind it, but I know that it happened.
[31.90 --> 38.20]  Also, I don't know, Bored Ape people? They're all blind now. That's not true.
[38.62 --> 42.48]  That's not actually true, but there was a pretty...
[42.48 --> 51.80]  It's like some crazy level of UV lights were used at an event and it gave some people some temporary eye issues or something.
[51.92 --> 53.60]  Yeah, NFTs. They're the future.
[53.60 --> 54.40]  So funny.
[57.48 --> 64.30]  Oh.
[64.30 --> 64.32]  Oh.
[74.82 --> 78.78]  Show is brought to you today by SignalWire, Grammarly, and UPDF.
[78.84 --> 81.82]  I want to jump right into Intel's branding getting dumber than ever.
[81.94 --> 82.92]  Yeah, how's that even possible?
[82.92 --> 91.74]  I know, right? First of all, I mean, okay. Let's go way back. Remember when they launched Core 2 Duo?
[92.30 --> 92.56]  Yeah.
[93.16 --> 101.44]  Okay. What was up with that? You had to say, I bought a Core 2 Duo dual core.
[101.44 --> 108.26]  If you wanted to describe the processor, you got like the whole thing, the whole branding of Core.
[108.26 --> 110.10]  I bought a 2-2-2-2.
[110.10 --> 115.54]  Especially in the context of how recognizable their Pentium brand was at the time.
[115.92 --> 129.62]  How strong that brand was at the time. It just made no sense. Okay. Then the brand had weakened a little bit, but I never felt any of this was really necessary.
[129.62 --> 130.94]  I still thought it was really strong.
[130.94 --> 136.38]  I don't think just about anything could have been dumber than Core. Core 2.
[137.32 --> 143.04]  And then instead of Core 3, we get second gen Core? The f*** are you talking about?
[143.52 --> 147.06]  Like the whole thing. Anyway, we've all kind of accepted it now, right?
[147.06 --> 156.00]  So you got your i7 and your i5 and your i3. They eventually added i9s, which were rumored at the very beginning.
[156.40 --> 164.10]  It was supposed to be, this is my understanding, it was supposed to be that on the consumer side of things, you had your core i3, which was your very basic low end.
[164.18 --> 168.36]  But then also you had Pentiums down there for some reason. I don't know, whatever. And then like Celeron still exists.
[168.60 --> 172.28]  Do you really need six tiers? Okay, it doesn't matter. The point is, you had your core i3, that's your low end.
[172.28 --> 179.22]  You had your core i5, that's your mainstream gamer. You had your core i7, that's your like premium enthusiast gamer, overclocker, whatever else.
[179.54 --> 183.16]  And then that was on the consumer side. Then you had high-end desktop.
[184.06 --> 188.58]  And it was, as far as I knew, supposed to be that those were core i9s.
[188.92 --> 191.96]  I'm talking way back, I'm talking like 12, 13 years ago or whenever this was.
[192.40 --> 195.76]  And then they just didn't. They were just all core i7s.
[195.76 --> 212.48]  And the whole thing made no sense because you had this product stratification that was like basic mid-tier, high-end consumer, and then like workstation slash enthusiast gamer, whatever.
[213.76 --> 216.38]  What? And they were so much more expensive.
[216.54 --> 219.32]  So you could have two different core i7s from the same generation.
[219.42 --> 222.78]  And one of them is quad core and one of them has like 10 cores in it or whatever.
[222.78 --> 223.48]  Yeah, it was wacky.
[223.62 --> 236.54]  And then so and then instead of core 3, core 4, core 5, we went with second gen core, third generation core, fourth generation core, and then so on and so forth.
[236.78 --> 245.90]  So anyway, they've done away with this i3, i5, i7 thing, supposedly, for the upcoming Meteor Lake refresh generation.
[245.90 --> 262.28]  And instead what we're getting is core ultra 5, core ultra 9, core ultra 7, which is like honestly kind of better than the whole i thing, in my opinion.
[262.54 --> 264.60]  But here's where things get really stupid.
[265.08 --> 271.20]  These are going to be first gen core or first gen core ultra.
[271.20 --> 274.88]  What?
[276.02 --> 280.98]  So what would have been called a 14th gen Intel Core i9-14900K?
[282.10 --> 283.90]  Or so, not what would have been called.
[284.20 --> 285.70]  That's previous naming scheme.
[285.96 --> 292.54]  New naming scheme is Intel first gen core ultra 9-185H.
[293.80 --> 294.72]  What a name.
[295.12 --> 296.68]  It's so long.
[296.68 --> 309.48]  Is it a competition at this point in the industry to make your products as unsearchable and undecipherable as possible?
[309.82 --> 312.76]  We already have a first gen core.
[312.96 --> 314.82]  It was stupid the first time.
[315.16 --> 317.08]  We don't need another one.
[319.48 --> 320.12]  Anyway.
[320.12 --> 326.12]  Also, like if you're going to say first gen, like they said, like the old naming scheme, even.
[326.26 --> 326.80]  This is weird.
[326.96 --> 328.82]  Like 14th gen Intel core.
[329.42 --> 331.08]  You don't have to put 14 anymore.
[332.54 --> 332.90]  Really.
[333.12 --> 334.90]  If you put 14th at the beginning.
[335.90 --> 336.94]  You know what I think it is?
[336.98 --> 338.40]  It's because they're going to shorten the product names.
[338.48 --> 340.96]  But if that's going to happen, then just don't make it long in the first place.
[341.02 --> 344.38]  I think Intel just has a really high sensitivity around the number 14.
[344.38 --> 347.64]  I think that's a traumatic number for them.
[347.64 --> 349.46]  Why?
[349.98 --> 354.34]  Because they were stuck on 14 nanometer for like a zillion years and it cost them their business with Apple.
[355.08 --> 355.30]  Yep.
[355.84 --> 361.78]  So that's what I actually think this is about because this is too dumb to be a rational decision.
[361.96 --> 363.66]  This is obviously an emotional decision.
[363.90 --> 364.66]  We refuse to do it again.
[365.16 --> 372.64]  Current benchmarks are not great for 14th gen Meteor Lake, but that doesn't necessarily tell us anything that...
[373.66 --> 374.30]  Wait a minute.
[374.42 --> 375.24]  Current benchmarks are poor.
[375.70 --> 376.92]  Did I say 14th gen Meteor?
[376.92 --> 377.20]  No.
[377.32 --> 377.54]  Okay.
[377.64 --> 377.78]  No.
[377.88 --> 378.04]  Sorry.
[378.10 --> 378.82]  Not 14th gen.
[378.92 --> 380.06]  Whatever it is.
[380.68 --> 381.70]  Core Ultra...
[381.70 --> 382.52]  Who cares?
[382.62 --> 383.08]  Meteor Lake.
[384.00 --> 387.30]  Current benchmarks are apparently poor, but these could be very early samples.
[387.42 --> 389.46]  They're not optimized for the particular benchmark that was running.
[389.54 --> 390.14]  This is a leak.
[390.64 --> 397.82]  And in other news, Intel has discontinued their cryo-cooling technology after four generations,
[397.82 --> 402.16]  with 13th gen Raptor Lake chips being the last ones supported.
[402.16 --> 409.06]  Can we pour one out here for Intel's cryo-cooling technology?
[412.50 --> 412.96]  There.
[413.54 --> 414.00]  It's just...
[414.00 --> 414.48]  Well, I don't know.
[414.52 --> 418.82]  I don't have a glass, so this is my only fluid vessel right now.
[418.92 --> 419.50]  The point is...
[419.50 --> 420.20]  What about yourself?
[420.20 --> 424.76]  Are you familiar with Intel cryo-cooling?
[426.50 --> 427.42]  Not really.
[427.54 --> 427.82]  Okay.
[428.16 --> 429.18]  But I am a fluid vessel.
[429.34 --> 430.16]  Super cool.
[430.72 --> 436.08]  I think the neatest thing about Intel's cryo-cooling initiative is that a company as corporate and
[436.08 --> 441.44]  boring as Intel ever got to get a project like this out of the test lab.
[441.76 --> 448.76]  Basically, what it was, was a Peltier-assisted water-cooling setup that had a whole software
[448.76 --> 455.86]  component that monitored the temperatures both of the CPU and also the surrounding area
[455.86 --> 461.68]  so that it could chill the CPU as cold as it could go without crossing over the dewpoint
[461.68 --> 463.42]  threshold and causing condensation.
[464.72 --> 466.02]  That sounds sick.
[466.50 --> 466.94]  Cool.
[467.20 --> 472.26]  Would have been absolutely amazing on AMD where the chip power consumption wasn't so
[472.26 --> 474.24]  high that it overwhelmed the tech.
[474.72 --> 476.84]  Sorry, when I say tech, I don't mean the technology.
[477.08 --> 480.56]  The thermoelectric cooling Peltier effect module.
[481.16 --> 485.04]  So, the way that a Peltier works in this context...
[485.04 --> 487.84]  Okay, first let's start with how a Peltier works if you're not familiar with them.
[488.46 --> 492.72]  Basically, you power them and then through some kind of wizardry...
[492.72 --> 493.14]  I forget.
[493.14 --> 497.76]  It's the kind of thing that at some point I knew, but I have to look it up every time I
[497.76 --> 499.32]  make a video about it because I forget.
[499.32 --> 501.30]  Because, believe it or not, I can't remember everything.
[501.30 --> 501.80]  I can't remember everything.
[501.80 --> 504.54]  So, the point is, it's a powered module.
[504.54 --> 509.52]  You feed it DC power and then you have a cold side and a hot side.
[509.52 --> 517.04]  And the hot side would go to a water cooling system that pumps fluid through a block and
[517.04 --> 517.96]  then over to a radiator.
[518.24 --> 524.32]  And then the cold side would sit right onto the CPU integrated heat spreader, pulling that
[524.32 --> 526.86]  heat and then getting rid of it on the hot side.
[526.86 --> 527.90]  Here's the problem, though.
[528.64 --> 531.48]  Peltier will typically draw anywhere from...
[531.48 --> 538.76]  I mean, if you were to try to cool a modern CPU with it, anywhere from 150 to...
[538.76 --> 540.10]  I mean, you'd have to...
[540.10 --> 540.54]  Yeah, they're really brutal.
[540.68 --> 544.38]  Yeah, you'd have to be in excess of 300, 400 watts in some cases.
[544.48 --> 550.48]  And I don't even think Peltier modules, the size of a CPU, even go that high.
[550.48 --> 553.06]  I think they max out in the 250 range.
[553.60 --> 558.46]  So, that's problem number one, is that we're somewhat limited by the size of these Peltier
[558.46 --> 558.94]  modules.
[559.84 --> 565.74]  Problem number two is that when I talk about them being rated for 150 watts or 250 watts
[565.74 --> 568.70]  or whatever, that is the power they are sucking.
[569.08 --> 575.72]  So, if you are running that Peltier at full tilt, if it is actually powerful enough to cool
[575.72 --> 582.20]  like a high-end gaming processor today, you are adding like hundreds of watts to your
[582.20 --> 585.78]  CPU or to your CPU, to your system power draw.
[586.54 --> 587.26]  Oh, yeah.
[587.36 --> 588.46]  And it gets even better.
[588.82 --> 593.30]  Remember how I said that we've got that water cooling loop with the radiator to dissipate
[593.30 --> 594.26]  the heat from the CPU?
[595.12 --> 602.20]  Well, what happens to all the heat that's generated on the hot side of that Peltier from the Peltier
[602.20 --> 602.62]  effect?
[603.02 --> 604.56]  Well, you've got to dissipate that, too.
[604.56 --> 612.24]  So, Peltiers are the kind of thing that have been done time and time again in the enthusiast
[612.24 --> 612.78]  space.
[612.94 --> 616.02]  So, this was like in standard Intel fashion.
[616.70 --> 618.90]  Other brands made it, but their tech was on it?
[619.32 --> 621.22]  Yeah, and it was their software that ran it.
[621.70 --> 621.86]  Yeah.
[622.14 --> 623.38]  Yeah, super, super cool.
[623.38 --> 624.86]  Oh, so they're abandoning the software, too?
[624.98 --> 627.34]  So, they're abandoning the whole shebang.
[627.34 --> 628.00]  That's unfortunate.
[628.64 --> 629.34]  Here we go.
[629.38 --> 629.76]  Here we go.
[629.76 --> 634.78]  So, going all the way back to 2000.
[636.18 --> 637.08]  Oh, wow.
[637.14 --> 640.62]  That's a very early Swift tech water block.
[640.78 --> 641.26]  I love it.
[641.26 --> 644.62]  This is not a Peltier one.
[644.90 --> 645.12]  Shoot.
[645.26 --> 645.84]  I was trying to find.
[646.06 --> 649.06]  They had an old block from way back in the day.
[650.06 --> 654.14]  I have a blown apart picture on my screen right now that shows the...
[654.14 --> 654.70]  Here it is.
[654.70 --> 658.78]  MCW6500-T for tech.
[659.24 --> 661.42]  Peltier assisted water block.
[662.78 --> 663.84]  This is so cool.
[664.72 --> 667.92]  You can tell Swift tech had glown up a little bit by that point.
[668.12 --> 668.32]  Yeah.
[670.82 --> 671.72]  226 watts.
[672.40 --> 672.84]  Dang.
[673.14 --> 673.56]  Dang.
[673.56 --> 673.62]  Dang.
[673.80 --> 677.32]  So, this has been tried many times over the years.
[677.46 --> 678.16]  I forget.
[678.54 --> 682.26]  Someone did a Peltier assisted CPU heatsink.
[682.38 --> 684.08]  While you look that up, I'm going to show my screen.
[684.08 --> 686.02]  Because I actually like this little model that they did.
[686.16 --> 687.58]  I realize our camera is going to be covering it.
[687.62 --> 689.72]  But you can see this white panel in here.
[690.12 --> 691.92]  That would be the tech or the Peltier.
[693.14 --> 694.48]  If you're wire running out of it.
[694.80 --> 696.04]  So, it's like it's a little layer.
[696.20 --> 697.42]  It's a fairly small.
[697.56 --> 698.08]  Like, they're actually very...
[699.14 --> 699.64]  Yeah.
[699.78 --> 700.14]  Small.
[700.72 --> 701.08]  But they...
[701.90 --> 703.92]  You can pack a punch if you're willing to power them.
[703.92 --> 706.96]  I'm trying to find...
[706.96 --> 712.86]  I'm trying to find the awful heatsink that basically, as far as I can tell, didn't really
[712.86 --> 716.74]  make it out of sort of first initial small production run.
[718.56 --> 718.96]  Yeah.
[719.06 --> 719.44]  I just...
[719.44 --> 720.90]  I can't find this one right now.
[721.26 --> 723.26]  Maybe someone can link it to me in the chat.
[723.26 --> 725.52]  The point is, it's been tried a lot of times.
[725.52 --> 728.74]  And every time, we come up against the same barriers.
[728.94 --> 735.06]  Which is finding Peltiers that are performant enough to remove the heat from modern processors.
[735.06 --> 738.66]  Which just run so, so hot.
[739.50 --> 740.30]  Oh, also.
[740.48 --> 745.26]  That Peltier effect takes place over the entire thermoelectric cooling module.
[746.22 --> 753.38]  So, if you have a super, super hot spot, like on Intel CPU, and then mostly less heat around
[753.38 --> 757.36]  the outsides, you're going to need a spreader in between, which adds some inefficiency.
[758.30 --> 761.00]  Like, in addition to the actual CPU's spreader.
[761.06 --> 763.98]  So, you have to spread it out so you can actually make use of that whole surface area.
[764.28 --> 767.22]  And the higher the wattage, typically, the larger the Peltier module.
[767.36 --> 769.62]  So, you've got these size limitations.
[770.06 --> 771.54]  You've got these performance limitations.
[771.54 --> 775.52]  And then you've got these, how do I remove all of this bloody heat limitations?
[775.52 --> 783.08]  Like, if you actually had a 400 watt Peltier that could actually cool a turboing, modern,
[783.52 --> 790.74]  like, 14th core, 13, like, 13900KS or something like that, when it's running an all core load.
[790.90 --> 795.82]  You would be crapping out 800 watts of heat into your room.
[796.56 --> 797.68]  Literally double.
[797.78 --> 799.28]  And that assumes perfect efficiency.
[799.28 --> 802.86]  Well, no, it doesn't, because any inefficiency loses heat.
[802.94 --> 809.98]  The point is, you would be just cooking yourself or paying more for, you know, air conditioning
[809.98 --> 812.62]  or whatever else to cool down your stupid furnace of a computer.
[813.84 --> 820.58]  However, what I liked about this, and I genuinely did like this product, even if I would never use it,
[820.80 --> 822.84]  was that it was cool.
[822.84 --> 832.54]  They had these, they had these, like, boots that sat over the blocks that they worked with their partners on to keep condensation off of them.
[832.62 --> 835.16]  These, like, foam insulated backplates and stuff.
[835.46 --> 843.50]  And what they could do well, even with these modern chips being, generating so much heat that they would overwhelm the Peltier.
[843.80 --> 844.96]  Oh, yeah, that's a big thing.
[845.08 --> 848.10]  If you don't spec it high enough, it actually turns into an insulator.
[848.10 --> 850.66]  Because it's not metal.
[850.86 --> 851.00]  Yeah.
[851.30 --> 851.54]  Right?
[851.68 --> 858.32]  So, if it's not actively moving the heat, then it isn't moving the heat.
[858.42 --> 860.78]  And the heat is staying where it is.
[861.44 --> 862.06]  That makes sense.
[862.08 --> 862.84]  That's a big problem, right?
[862.86 --> 863.26]  That's not good.
[863.26 --> 867.86]  So, there was some practical use for them.
[867.98 --> 873.64]  If you knew that you were never going to apply an all-core load to your computer, like, literally never,
[875.56 --> 881.20]  within the range of the Peltier's effective, sort of, within the Peltier's effective cooling range,
[881.48 --> 884.54]  you could achieve very low temperatures.
[884.54 --> 892.80]  And you could achieve slightly better overclocks on, you know, the one or two cores, or even four cores, that you might need for gaming.
[893.22 --> 897.74]  It's just that, I think the timing is just bad.
[897.88 --> 901.48]  Intel's chips have been functionally not overclockable.
[901.86 --> 908.06]  At least at the high end, where people might consider buying a, you know, $600 water cooling setup, or whatever else it is.
[908.22 --> 908.42]  Yeah.
[908.42 --> 911.40]  Um, they've been not overclockable for so long.
[911.48 --> 917.80]  They've been so power hungry for so long that it's just, right products, maybe completely wrong timing,
[917.80 --> 919.94]  and unfortunately, it's going away now.
[919.96 --> 928.18]  And I'm just, I'm a little, I'm a little sad, because it's the kind of thing that, as an enthusiast, I just, I kind of love,
[928.24 --> 929.20]  because it's just really cool.
[929.28 --> 932.36]  What, I just power this thing, and then it just moves the heat from one spot to another?
[932.78 --> 934.60]  We, and there are times when it makes sense.
[934.60 --> 939.76]  Okay, Luke and I were comparing our eight sleep, um, sleep tracking before the show.
[940.78 --> 944.74]  The cooling and heating module for the two sides of the bed uses a Peltier.
[945.04 --> 945.22]  Yeah.
[945.30 --> 949.68]  And the reason it does is because if it used phase change, then it would be really loud.
[949.74 --> 950.62]  It would need a compressor.
[951.14 --> 952.74]  A Peltier doesn't need a compressor.
[952.94 --> 959.14]  Just silent DC current is all it needs to heat or chill something.
[959.26 --> 961.30]  That, oh, that's so cool.
[961.30 --> 965.18]  Uh, my, oh, my water-cooled chair project that we did a while back.
[965.26 --> 968.56]  That also uses a Peltier with an air heat sink on it.
[968.94 --> 974.46]  So, if you're not, if you're trying to cool a human body, which is about 100 watts, right?
[974.56 --> 978.14]  Or just, like, part of a human body, it's pretty reasonable.
[978.40 --> 978.54]  Yeah.
[978.66 --> 983.00]  But as soon as you're trying to cool a computer or something like that, it just, it just doesn't,
[983.16 --> 984.32]  it doesn't make any sense.
[984.84 --> 985.64]  Kind of an issue.
[986.24 --> 987.12]  So, I'm sad.
[987.60 --> 988.16]  I'm sad.
[988.16 --> 988.52]  Okay.
[989.00 --> 991.56]  Uh, what do you want to talk about next?
[991.86 --> 993.06]  You missed everything this week.
[993.12 --> 995.22]  Do you want to jump straight into this week in AI?
[996.24 --> 996.56]  Sure.
[996.76 --> 997.08]  Okay.
[997.20 --> 997.64]  Yeah, sure.
[997.66 --> 999.34]  Let's talk about the escapist employees escaping.
[999.50 --> 999.80]  Can you?
[999.94 --> 1000.12]  Yeah.
[1000.22 --> 1001.08]  Can you read the article?
[1001.60 --> 1003.30]  Is your brain fast enough?
[1003.38 --> 1003.72]  We'll see.
[1003.72 --> 1005.32]  He was talking about this before the show.
[1005.42 --> 1006.94]  He was like, uh.
[1007.50 --> 1008.38]  I got some brain lag.
[1008.48 --> 1010.74]  My, uh, um, what?
[1010.74 --> 1013.50]  We had a few of those moments.
[1013.98 --> 1019.68]  Um, the escapist has seen mass resignations following the firing of editor, uh, editor-in-chief
[1019.68 --> 1020.90]  Nick Calandra.
[1021.10 --> 1021.86]  Hopefully I said that right.
[1022.12 --> 1022.92]  Among others.
[1023.12 --> 1029.02]  Resignees include most of the escapist video team, including game reviewer Ben Yahtzee
[1029.02 --> 1036.14]  Crowshaw, the primary creator behind Zero Punctuation, which is a series that at least on and off,
[1036.14 --> 1039.32]  I believe we've both been watching for an extremely long time.
[1039.32 --> 1040.80]  Yeah, like over 10 years.
[1041.16 --> 1042.40]  Oh, it launched in 2008.
[1042.40 --> 1043.02]  Yeah, it launched in 2008.
[1043.16 --> 1045.26]  I've been probably watching it since around then.
[1045.58 --> 1045.88]  That's wild.
[1046.24 --> 1046.38]  Yeah.
[1046.78 --> 1051.16]  Uh, Yahtzee's contributions were by far the most popular content on the site, uh, to
[1051.16 --> 1055.80]  the point that many commenters have speculated that the escapist may not survive this loss.
[1055.82 --> 1056.78]  I don't see how they could.
[1056.98 --> 1064.24]  Honestly, when I heard that Yahtzee was gone, I assumed escapist was just literally done automatically.
[1064.24 --> 1068.28]  I haven't seen any of their other content perform particularly well.
[1068.28 --> 1071.58]  Then again, I only pay attention to the video side of things.
[1071.76 --> 1072.30]  Me too.
[1072.30 --> 1076.20]  Like, I don't really, um, every once in a while an escapist article will end up in my
[1076.20 --> 1077.98]  Google News feed or whatever else, but I don't.
[1078.44 --> 1081.88]  I didn't know that the escapists had written articles for like many years.
[1082.00 --> 1083.74]  I don't end up there as a destination.
[1083.74 --> 1088.32]  Um, the only thing I ever really cared about from them was zero punctuation.
[1088.60 --> 1093.14]  So good luck with that.
[1093.36 --> 1093.58]  Yeah.
[1093.76 --> 1094.04]  Yeah.
[1094.04 --> 1097.88]  I'm, I'm looking at their video library and zero punctuation.
[1097.88 --> 1099.16]  Zero punctuation spikes up.
[1099.30 --> 1104.82]  Outperformed everything else by like an order of magnitude basically to the point where if
[1104.82 --> 1108.36]  I was them and if I was advising them on their video strategy, I would just stop publishing
[1108.36 --> 1109.26]  a lot of this other stuff.
[1109.26 --> 1109.94]  I wouldn't even bother.
[1110.20 --> 1114.80]  Well, they should have done that a long time ago probably, but anyways, um, Yahtzee, Calandra
[1114.80 --> 1119.98]  and other members of the former video team have started a new channel called Second Wind,
[1120.20 --> 1123.00]  which already has over 130,000 subscribers.
[1123.16 --> 1128.04]  They will be hosting short form reviews under the title fully ramblamatic.
[1128.36 --> 1131.88]  Oh, that's his old, uh, that's like his old name for something.
[1132.16 --> 1132.98]  Oh, I didn't actually know that.
[1133.04 --> 1133.14]  Yeah.
[1133.14 --> 1135.98]  I think he had like a blog or something called fully ramblamatic.
[1135.98 --> 1141.44]  Because they are saying that apparently zero punctuation branding still is owned and belongs
[1141.44 --> 1143.28]  to the escapist, which makes sense.
[1143.36 --> 1146.04]  So using something that he used to have would line up.
[1146.04 --> 1154.00]  Uh, the current owners of the escapist gamers group, G A M U R S, um, acquired the site alongside
[1154.00 --> 1157.64]  several other popular online gaming outlets last year.
[1157.70 --> 1163.54]  They received negative media, uh, attention earlier this year when they fired around 40% of
[1163.54 --> 1170.20]  their staff, then attempted to replace said staff, the writing team with a single AI copy editor
[1170.20 --> 1176.98]  handling 250 articles a week, uh, which I believe we even talked about on this show, um, and went
[1176.98 --> 1177.90]  very poorly.
[1178.60 --> 1186.54]  According to Calandra, he was fired by gamers for not achieving goals that demonstrated a poor,
[1186.54 --> 1191.88]  that, uh, I, I think this is trying to say that, that he believes, uh, demonstrated a poor
[1191.88 --> 1193.70]  understanding of the escapist audience.
[1195.28 --> 1195.84]  Sheesh.
[1196.54 --> 1199.26]  Um, yeah.
[1199.84 --> 1209.20]  Try to imagine if we lost like our, our top performing host and most of our other staff,
[1209.44 --> 1212.98]  what would be left here as a, as a, as a media organization?
[1212.98 --> 1221.76]  Like imagining first, I, I just, I don't know how to wrap my brain around organizations
[1221.76 --> 1228.20]  like a gamers group here that I hate the name by the way, but I say, well, gamers group
[1228.20 --> 1230.18]  and they just spelled it G A M U R S.
[1230.32 --> 1232.36]  Like, well, okay.
[1232.42 --> 1237.52]  I mean, yeah, they've done a lot more than just the name to make us think that they're
[1237.52 --> 1239.66]  idiots, but fair enough.
[1239.76 --> 1242.34]  Can somebody please explain this to me?
[1242.66 --> 1245.46]  Like, I, I understand the strategy in some cases.
[1245.46 --> 1245.90]  Okay.
[1245.90 --> 1250.58]  Like I, one, one of my friends is a vet, um, who runs a practice.
[1250.94 --> 1252.24]  Um, she's great.
[1252.62 --> 1261.62]  And she was talking to me about how there is either one or two like veterinary, um, conglomerates,
[1261.62 --> 1268.96]  like animal hospital groups that are going around buying up all of the independent veterinarian
[1268.96 --> 1269.40]  clinics.
[1269.64 --> 1275.22]  And the reason that they're doing it is because they're playing an extremely long game here
[1275.22 --> 1284.56]  where the goal is complete consolidation, um, so that they can control pricing across all
[1284.56 --> 1286.26]  animal hospitals in a given region.
[1286.26 --> 1292.18]  And, and, and, and it, and it makes sense that they would pay sometimes double what it,
[1292.18 --> 1297.18]  you know, business valuation advisor might come in and tell you your practice is worth
[1297.18 --> 1299.66]  because they're playing a long game here.
[1299.76 --> 1305.02]  So if, if they don't get a complete return on that investment for 10 years, rather than,
[1305.08 --> 1309.50]  you know, five, which might be a more normal target, then they're comfortable with that because
[1309.50 --> 1314.96]  they've got plenty of cash coming in from everything that they've acquired already over the years.
[1314.96 --> 1321.50]  They've got investment and there's a clear path to not just profitability, but market control.
[1323.26 --> 1330.66]  What could possibly make you think that that playbook would work with game review websites?
[1332.04 --> 1337.12]  So yeah, the, the, the, these, these, these veterinary acquisition people, like they, yeah,
[1337.14 --> 1340.44]  they'll go in and they'll like lay off staff and they'll, they'll, they'll cut equipment
[1340.44 --> 1343.62]  budgets or, you know, whatever else, like the quality of care might fall.
[1343.62 --> 1347.34]  Um, but at the end of the day, these are physical locations.
[1347.46 --> 1348.96]  What, what are, what are people going to do?
[1349.04 --> 1355.08]  Just click a few buttons on their keyboard and navigate to a different competitor.
[1355.26 --> 1356.74]  It's not always that simple.
[1356.74 --> 1358.30]  There is a value to the branding.
[1358.46 --> 1360.24]  There's a value to the location.
[1360.34 --> 1365.04]  Especially when like, I don't think like if you, I don't know, I can't speak for them,
[1365.04 --> 1370.30]  but if you want more zero punctuation, it's not like Yahtzee's gone.
[1371.14 --> 1375.34]  As far as I can tell, the steam, the, the team's effectively staying together and going,
[1375.44 --> 1376.98]  Hey, you want more of that stuff?
[1377.06 --> 1377.70]  We're going to make it.
[1377.72 --> 1378.80]  We're just going to have a different name.
[1379.02 --> 1381.64]  So like, so I don't know.
[1381.64 --> 1388.20]  What can you possibly be thinking acquiring something like this thinking, Oh yeah, you
[1388.20 --> 1389.60]  know what would be a good idea?
[1390.10 --> 1396.62]  Taking this thing that we bought that is obviously working to a degree that we thought it was a
[1396.62 --> 1403.06]  good idea to buy it, completely breaking it so that it is not functional at all.
[1403.06 --> 1406.36]  And then profit.
[1407.28 --> 1409.10]  I don't understand it.
[1409.62 --> 1415.24]  Can, can somebody help me understand what the thought process could possibly be here?
[1415.96 --> 1416.84]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1417.70 --> 1423.02]  And like, if it was a bet on AI, I feel like they should have, uh, you know, vetted that
[1423.02 --> 1424.12]  a little bit more first.
[1424.32 --> 1429.80]  If it's a bet on AI, then just have your AI crap out 300 gaming review websites and start
[1429.80 --> 1433.88]  publishing garbage AI articles and try and gain some momentum that way.
[1434.80 --> 1436.74]  Honestly though, like that's not even me.
[1437.34 --> 1440.72]  No, that, I mean, that's a strategy people have literally done already.
[1440.72 --> 1443.60]  So like, it's not, it's not, it makes sense.
[1443.68 --> 1444.62]  Get good at that.
[1444.74 --> 1448.86]  And then, you know, buy a recognized name or something like that.
[1448.92 --> 1450.78]  Don't just, don't just walk in.
[1450.90 --> 1454.88]  We're already seeing that with, um, we've talked about this on, on Wancho before, but the
[1454.88 --> 1459.34]  whole Reddit search term thing, searching on Google, but appending Reddit to the end of it,
[1459.34 --> 1464.72]  because you're hoping to get Reddit results instead of these like trash random, uh, like
[1464.72 --> 1468.32]  SEO optimized suggestion sites.
[1468.52 --> 1474.24]  And then those SEO optimized suggestion people are just making Reddit posts and trying to get
[1474.24 --> 1477.86]  those Reddit posts to the top of those searches as well, which is rough.
[1478.36 --> 1480.96]  Um, so like that, that type of stuff is already happening.
[1480.96 --> 1490.44]  With all of that said, with all of that said, I, it is pretty clear to me that if the escapist
[1490.44 --> 1499.00]  employed more than like two or three people, um, they were probably in serious trouble in
[1499.00 --> 1502.22]  terms of the sustainability of that business.
[1502.22 --> 1510.84]  So, you know, if the current ownership thought that, you know, a change in leadership was needed in order to
[1510.84 --> 1518.74]  make the business more sustainable, then, um, you know, I guess they made the move that they thought was best,
[1518.74 --> 1526.18]  but what they perhaps didn't anticipate was the level of loyalty that the staff would have to the former
[1526.18 --> 1526.86]  editor in chief.
[1526.92 --> 1531.48]  And when I say sustainable, um, I'll run you guys through some, some basic numbers here.
[1531.60 --> 1537.10]  So here you can pull up these stats for any YouTube channel on this great site called social blade.
[1537.24 --> 1538.46]  Uh, it used to be better.
[1538.58 --> 1539.44]  They used to a lot better.
[1539.56 --> 1539.66]  Yeah.
[1539.70 --> 1542.92]  They used to log more than just two years of monthly viewership.
[1543.04 --> 1544.26]  And YouTube was like, no,
[1544.36 --> 1546.48]  the subscriber counts used to be super granular.
[1546.48 --> 1551.06]  And then YouTube threatened to cut off their API access if they didn't comply.
[1551.06 --> 1552.80]  And so now the site's not as good.
[1552.94 --> 1555.58]  So, um, I don't know, go yourself YouTube, but whatever.
[1555.84 --> 1565.24]  The point is that, um, in the last four months, you know what, let's say the last quarter in the last three months,
[1565.24 --> 1570.08]  they averaged six and a half million views a month.
[1570.54 --> 1572.28]  So what does that work out to?
[1572.34 --> 1575.38]  Let's pull out ye olde calculatrice here.
[1576.14 --> 1577.14]  What just happened to my cal?
[1577.14 --> 1577.62]  Oh, there it is.
[1577.62 --> 1580.00]  Man, it was hiding.
[1580.12 --> 1580.72]  It was camouflaged.
[1580.80 --> 1581.16]  Look at that.
[1581.20 --> 1582.92]  It was like, whoa, you'll never see me here, Linus.
[1583.28 --> 1583.58]  Okay.
[1583.64 --> 1585.52]  So let's, let's pull out the old calculatrice.
[1585.66 --> 1588.42]  We'll replace the least important thing on my screen with it.
[1589.52 --> 1603.44]  Um, that works out to probably about, about it's, I would say a rough guideline is about a thousand dollars for every half a million views.
[1603.44 --> 1614.20]  So if we were to say 6.5 million divided by 0.5 equals times $1,000.
[1614.94 --> 1617.30]  Now, uh, hold on.
[1617.34 --> 1618.54]  That was times 10,000.
[1618.62 --> 1619.40]  One moment, please.
[1620.30 --> 1622.26]  Uh, oh my gosh.
[1622.36 --> 1623.64]  How did I even undo?
[1623.78 --> 1624.14]  You know what?
[1624.18 --> 1626.88]  The point is $13,000.
[1627.10 --> 1627.32]  Okay.
[1628.14 --> 1628.72]  One, two, three.
[1628.84 --> 1629.24]  There we go.
[1629.34 --> 1632.78]  We got $13,000, which sounds like a lot of money in a month.
[1632.78 --> 1633.98]  Pay taxes on that first.
[1634.10 --> 1635.20]  I'm sure lots of people would.
[1635.24 --> 1636.70]  Well, no, no, no, no, no, not necessarily.
[1636.80 --> 1637.34]  We'll get to that.
[1637.50 --> 1640.74]  I'm sure lots of people would love to make $13,000 a month.
[1640.94 --> 1646.82]  The problem is that that's $13,000 a month at all.
[1646.82 --> 1647.42]  Yeah.
[1648.84 --> 1656.44]  That's, um, pretty rough when you consider that, yeah, you might have maybe more than one person
[1656.44 --> 1656.90]  to pay.
[1657.04 --> 1657.52]  Now.
[1657.66 --> 1659.28]  The parent company is going to want to make money there.
[1659.52 --> 1665.22]  Now, obviously, uh, you're going to have, you know, equipment and business operating expenses
[1665.22 --> 1666.44]  and all that kind of stuff.
[1666.54 --> 1669.58]  I will also point out that they, they have their own website.
[1669.72 --> 1670.08]  They do.
[1670.16 --> 1671.14]  I was getting to that.
[1671.26 --> 1672.14]  And they have a Patreon.
[1672.38 --> 1672.66]  Yes.
[1673.08 --> 1675.44]  So, uh, what, what, what's the Patreon at?
[1675.44 --> 1675.82]  How's it?
[1675.84 --> 1676.38]  Well, okay.
[1676.40 --> 1678.60]  It's going to be hard to, Oh no, we can use Patreon stats.
[1679.16 --> 1680.80]  Is slightly obfuscated.
[1681.36 --> 1682.10]  Oh, is it?
[1682.40 --> 1688.10]  Um, because it doesn't tell you how many people per tier and they have a ton of tears.
[1688.26 --> 1689.30]  They have a lot of tears.
[1689.72 --> 1692.18]  They have got a lot of tears right now.
[1692.30 --> 1692.46]  Mail.
[1694.60 --> 1703.28]  They have a God tier mailbag communities choice credit sponsor, free and bonus content, early
[1703.28 --> 1704.62]  access and tip jar.
[1704.62 --> 1706.52]  Those are all different tears they have on Patreon.
[1706.96 --> 1707.08]  Okay.
[1708.18 --> 1708.84]  Paid members.
[1709.30 --> 1710.86]  Actually not bad.
[1711.22 --> 1712.54]  They have a decent amount of paid members right now.
[1712.60 --> 1713.96]  They're sitting at 1,949.
[1714.28 --> 1714.54]  Okay.
[1714.60 --> 1719.92]  If you had to make a wild guess, uh, based on having absolutely nothing to do with this
[1719.92 --> 1724.32]  industry at all, uh, what would you say is probably a pretty typical monthly contribution?
[1726.20 --> 1727.56]  Uh, well, okay.
[1727.88 --> 1729.52]  The, the problem with that.
[1729.52 --> 1730.36]  So they're there.
[1730.44 --> 1733.02]  It says their most popular tier is their $3 tier.
[1733.38 --> 1733.66]  Okay.
[1733.70 --> 1735.76]  So let's be optimistic and let's say $5.
[1735.96 --> 1736.24]  Yeah.
[1736.24 --> 1738.14]  I'm going to say, I'm going to say it's more than that.
[1738.22 --> 1742.26]  They do have a tier that's lower than that, but the thing that you, the stuff that you
[1742.26 --> 1744.02]  get on that tier is not that crazy.
[1744.02 --> 1746.58]  So I suspect it's going to be close to four or five months.
[1746.58 --> 1748.18]  Let's say they're making another 10 grand a month.
[1748.78 --> 1749.08]  Okay.
[1749.16 --> 1753.32]  I don't know if they do in video sponsorships, but I'm going to say maybe they do.
[1753.44 --> 1756.66]  I've never seen one on a zero punctuation video, but who knows?
[1756.88 --> 1760.48]  I'm going to say they do in video sponsorships and I'm going to take a totally ignorant
[1760.48 --> 1761.48]  stab at this.
[1761.52 --> 1764.76]  And I'm going to say, uh, they can probably double their AdSense with that.
[1764.90 --> 1767.32]  So we're up to the point where, oh, okay, hold on.
[1767.34 --> 1769.10]  We're looking at some pretty respectable revenue.
[1769.36 --> 1772.68]  Let's say they can do, let's say they can triple their Patreon number.
[1773.42 --> 1773.48]  Crazy.
[1773.62 --> 1774.80]  It helps to have external funding.
[1774.92 --> 1777.80]  Uh, other creators, if you want to join Flowplane, by the way.
[1777.96 --> 1779.02]  With their ads on their website.
[1779.12 --> 1779.32]  Okay.
[1779.42 --> 1787.58]  So let's put these two together and let's say they can do about $55,000 a month in, uh,
[1787.60 --> 1789.72]  in revenue or yeah.
[1790.26 --> 1790.70]  Okay.
[1791.18 --> 1791.94]  Oh my goodness.
[1792.28 --> 1792.52]  Okay.
[1792.68 --> 1795.44]  Let's say they can do $55,000 a month in revenue.
[1797.28 --> 1798.98]  Again, that sounds like a lot.
[1799.10 --> 1803.08]  Especially when we multiply it by 12 and we look for the year, you know, wow, that's
[1803.08 --> 1804.96]  like well over half a million dollars.
[1805.08 --> 1806.64]  That's, that's a freaking ton of money.
[1806.70 --> 1808.64]  You could actually pay a team of people out of that.
[1808.94 --> 1814.80]  The problem is that as far as I can tell, the Escapist team was a lot more than, you
[1814.80 --> 1816.48]  know, five or six people.
[1817.16 --> 1818.70]  Um, yeah.
[1818.74 --> 1821.50]  And like that Patreon isn't just the video team, right?
[1822.20 --> 1827.88]  They, they release a lot of articles looking at their website, like literally just for November
[1827.88 --> 1834.76]  10th, which is, uh, today, yesterday, something today.
[1835.20 --> 1836.00]  November 10th.
[1836.00 --> 1843.20]  There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven different articles released today.
[1843.20 --> 1847.04]  Um, and I, we did mention like, yeah, they have this external website.
[1847.58 --> 1855.52]  Um, this is an area where I have very little experience and has always confused me.
[1855.52 --> 1857.18]  So I'm just putting that out there first.
[1857.18 --> 1857.46]  Sure.
[1857.46 --> 1863.16]  But basically none of these have any comments, which is weird.
[1863.28 --> 1863.80]  Can I go to your screen?
[1863.90 --> 1864.02]  Yep.
[1864.44 --> 1866.62]  So this is the Escapist magazine's website.
[1867.14 --> 1872.64]  Uh, first one, this, uh, 824, Darren, whatever, Elon Musk biopic, zero comments.
[1872.92 --> 1876.14]  Maybe pick one from before the, uh, before the whole thing.
[1876.24 --> 1877.38]  Stardew Valley has two comments.
[1877.62 --> 1878.10]  Um.
[1878.10 --> 1880.76]  Cause this is like all from the last two days still.
[1880.96 --> 1883.14]  How do I even view more on just the articles?
[1883.30 --> 1883.60]  I don't know.
[1885.64 --> 1886.02]  Um.
[1888.40 --> 1888.80]  News?
[1891.04 --> 1892.60]  There was view more for podcasts.
[1892.74 --> 1892.90]  There we go.
[1892.96 --> 1893.32]  Wow.
[1893.86 --> 1894.22]  Um.
[1895.14 --> 1895.36]  Yeah.
[1895.38 --> 1895.70]  They published a few articles.
[1895.70 --> 1897.64]  Why would it go one, two, three, one thousand?
[1897.86 --> 1899.30]  That seems like quite the jump.
[1900.40 --> 1901.84]  I mean, these are all zeros.
[1902.74 --> 1903.96]  Oh, here's a few.
[1904.10 --> 1904.30]  Yeah.
[1904.30 --> 1905.66]  There's some comments on some of these.
[1905.96 --> 1906.36]  I mean.
[1906.36 --> 1910.12]  I mean, one to three is like, I think my point is still standing.
[1910.14 --> 1910.44]  Oh yeah.
[1910.48 --> 1911.44]  Your point's very valid.
[1911.58 --> 1913.78]  I don't know how much traction there is on these articles.
[1914.20 --> 1914.58]  Um.
[1915.74 --> 1920.02]  Maybe there's a bit, but I, I do know that yes, they have quite a few of them.
[1920.18 --> 1924.40]  Um, but webpage ads don't bring in a ton of money.
[1926.58 --> 1928.88]  So here's the problem.
[1929.30 --> 1936.34]  Um, I obviously don't see the point of buying something and then proceeding to
[1936.34 --> 1937.26]  trash it.
[1937.90 --> 1938.46]  Um, however.
[1938.84 --> 1938.86]  What do you mean?
[1938.86 --> 1939.42]  X is a great name.
[1941.00 --> 1950.12]  However, however, it is also possible that the escapist was simply a completely unsustainable
[1950.12 --> 1956.64]  machine the way that it was running and was only managing to pay salaries based on, you
[1956.64 --> 1962.00]  know, VC money or something like that, which was ultimately why the previous ownership seeked
[1962.00 --> 1962.48]  an exit.
[1962.70 --> 1967.88]  Even if that's the case, it might make, it might just mean that this move, uh, makes
[1967.88 --> 1973.38]  even more sense for the video team because they were clearly able to release some bangers
[1973.38 --> 1975.88]  for a lot of years.
[1975.88 --> 1979.84]  Like zero punctuation hasn't just been like successful.
[1979.84 --> 1983.70]  It's, it's been, uh, prolific.
[1984.10 --> 1988.12]  The problem is that it doesn't have the same momentum that it used to.
[1988.18 --> 1990.04]  And I don't, I couldn't really answer why.
[1990.04 --> 1993.92]  I mean, that's fair enough, but it still does like video gaming content in general, I would
[1993.92 --> 1996.36]  actually argue doesn't have the momentum that it used to.
[1996.84 --> 1999.32]  Um, like, Oh, I would like to hear this argument more.
[1999.32 --> 2010.68]  I think in years past, I'd wager honestly, probably around like 2013, 14, maybe gaming content
[2010.68 --> 2012.36]  on YouTube was actually really big.
[2012.36 --> 2014.72]  And I don't just mean let's plays and stuff.
[2014.96 --> 2016.04]  Are you, is it possible?
[2016.48 --> 2017.70]  You was more into it.
[2017.70 --> 2018.84]  It is possible.
[2019.32 --> 2020.56]  Uh, but I think so.
[2020.56 --> 2023.16]  Cause like game ranks is the biggest one that I know of right now.
[2024.14 --> 2029.08]  Um, and, and to be very clear, I think game ranks is fantastic.
[2029.32 --> 2035.14]  Um, but for like the biggest of a segment and maybe I'm just wrong and maybe we should
[2035.14 --> 2037.24]  just like social blade the category and see if I'm wrong.
[2037.86 --> 2044.10]  Um, but yeah, game ranks going through their average views of the last little bit.
[2044.54 --> 2047.26]  They do have some stuff that hits really well.
[2047.26 --> 2051.06]  Like they did 10, 10 game features that are evolving backwards.
[2051.06 --> 2052.98]  That did 780,000 views.
[2053.18 --> 2054.00]  Really nice.
[2054.14 --> 2058.84]  So when you say gaming content, you specifically don't mean let's plays.
[2058.84 --> 2062.32]  Or Twitch streamers who are reacting to stuff or whatever.
[2062.54 --> 2062.66]  Okay.
[2062.76 --> 2063.02]  I see.
[2063.48 --> 2068.22]  News, uh, like, like my favorite thing that game ranks does is called before you buy.
[2069.00 --> 2069.44]  Got it.
[2069.52 --> 2071.74]  So it's like a relatively early on review.
[2071.88 --> 2073.46]  So you're talking like video journalism.
[2073.76 --> 2074.12]  Yes.
[2074.34 --> 2074.74]  Okay.
[2075.08 --> 2075.34]  Yeah.
[2075.56 --> 2080.20]  Video game journalism was like pretty pop in a while ago.
[2080.68 --> 2081.04]  Right.
[2081.04 --> 2083.52]  Um, well, I mean, you know what happened, right?
[2086.26 --> 2087.02]  There's no money.
[2087.34 --> 2087.58]  Yeah.
[2088.52 --> 2090.86]  How are you supposed to, it's not, it's not sustainable.
[2091.08 --> 2096.98]  Sponsors for some reason aren't a huge fan of gaming content.
[2096.98 --> 2103.90]  Well, I can think of a lot of reasons why that would be the, the purchase intent is relative.
[2103.90 --> 2105.06]  Make that noise right now.
[2105.26 --> 2107.72]  The purchase intent is relatively low.
[2107.96 --> 2108.12]  Yeah.
[2108.18 --> 2110.82]  The audience skews relatively young.
[2111.00 --> 2112.00]  They're also extremely volatile.
[2112.38 --> 2112.68]  Yep.
[2112.68 --> 2117.96]  Um, it's, it's a really, um, don't take this the wrong way gamers.
[2119.00 --> 2120.80]  It's a pretty toxic culture.
[2120.94 --> 2121.46]  Oh, absolutely.
[2121.60 --> 2122.00]  Overall.
[2122.14 --> 2130.42]  Like, I think if we're honest with ourselves, the, the, the, the, uh, the brand association
[2130.42 --> 2135.44]  with, uh, you know, a lot of video gaming content and a lot of video gaming communities
[2135.44 --> 2142.18]  is not necessarily the, going to be super attractive to your big brands.
[2142.18 --> 2144.44]  You know, you're safe brands.
[2145.92 --> 2151.96]  Um, oh no.
[2152.08 --> 2153.06]  Are people hating me now?
[2153.16 --> 2153.32]  No.
[2153.44 --> 2154.42]  Suba and full plane chat.
[2154.46 --> 2155.20]  It's just like, we know.
[2157.10 --> 2157.46]  Cool.
[2160.06 --> 2160.76]  Breaking news.
[2160.84 --> 2162.56]  Linus says games are a fickle market.
[2162.66 --> 2162.78]  Yeah.
[2162.84 --> 2163.04]  Okay.
[2163.12 --> 2163.50]  Right.
[2163.58 --> 2163.82]  Okay.
[2163.90 --> 2167.50]  And I, I, I'd say that it's fair to say that there's very low loyalty.
[2168.28 --> 2171.26]  Um, and so it's, it's really tough.
[2171.26 --> 2176.60]  Oh, also, this is another really challenging thing is in order to break out in gaming, you
[2176.60 --> 2178.66]  have to, I don't even know.
[2178.74 --> 2182.06]  I could, if someone said, look, I want to break out in gaming content.
[2182.72 --> 2184.00]  Um, how do I do it?
[2184.16 --> 2190.16]  You know, as, as someone who has experience building a, a, a, a six, I would say pretty
[2190.16 --> 2193.60]  successful YouTube business, online video business.
[2193.60 --> 2197.78]  The first thing I would tell you is I have no idea.
[2198.38 --> 2206.66]  I, I wouldn't even know where to begin to break out in, in YouTube, um, in, in gaming
[2206.66 --> 2207.14]  on YouTube.
[2207.14 --> 2212.82]  So there's, there's, there's a few channels, um, like a hoy.
[2213.04 --> 2214.46]  I don't actually know how to pronounce it.
[2214.52 --> 2215.34]  Ahoy, a hoy.
[2215.48 --> 2215.94]  I don't know.
[2216.06 --> 2217.00]  A H O Y.
[2217.00 --> 2222.66]  Um, and, and there's, I think there's one called Arch as well.
[2223.84 --> 2231.40]  Um, and there's a, there's a few others that have like a, a kind of particular like history,
[2231.40 --> 2241.02]  interesting documentary kind of take on, on gaming content that I, I find like super,
[2241.22 --> 2241.98]  super interesting.
[2241.98 --> 2244.36]  Um, and they do really well.
[2244.36 --> 2249.46]  And like this, this a hoy that I just mentioned, their biggest problem is their, their content
[2249.46 --> 2251.68]  release schedule is like actually insane.
[2251.98 --> 2258.50]  Like if you look at their last eight videos, um, the last one was three years ago, but they
[2258.50 --> 2260.42]  are continually releasing content.
[2261.10 --> 2261.62]  Wow.
[2261.74 --> 2262.10]  Okay.
[2262.42 --> 2263.74]  Like, I don't know.
[2263.74 --> 2266.16]  Like they've never stopped in that three years.
[2266.42 --> 2268.36]  Um, they've actually been releasing content.
[2268.36 --> 2271.96]  If I, if I keep scrolling, yeah, nine years, 10 years.
[2272.82 --> 2273.30]  Yeah.
[2274.60 --> 2278.00]  They 11 years, they keep going back, but they have, they have all this really interesting
[2278.00 --> 2278.30]  stuff.
[2278.34 --> 2282.26]  Like the, what made me search them up was, uh, this video.
[2282.26 --> 2283.72]  It's just called big boxes.
[2283.72 --> 2285.58]  It has 760,000 views.
[2285.70 --> 2289.84]  It's like a mini doc on boxes in games.
[2290.08 --> 2295.30]  You know how like gaming boxes used to be huge and they got smaller and there was different
[2295.30 --> 2298.68]  like formats and it's like actually surprisingly very interesting.
[2299.30 --> 2299.74]  Wow.
[2299.84 --> 2300.02]  Okay.
[2300.02 --> 2304.94]  It's like why, like, like EA brought like some standardization to boxes and like all
[2304.94 --> 2305.74]  this, I don't know.
[2305.76 --> 2309.06]  I watched it a while ago, maybe up to three years ago.
[2309.06 --> 2311.82]  I remember when the battle chest was like in the shape of a chest.
[2311.94 --> 2312.16]  Yeah.
[2312.34 --> 2312.58]  Yeah.
[2312.68 --> 2316.06]  Like he talks about all this different type of stuff and like why different things
[2316.06 --> 2321.36]  changed and like how it's like kind of sad that now there's like basically no box and
[2321.36 --> 2325.10]  the box serves no purpose because back in the day without the internet and all this kind
[2325.10 --> 2328.92]  of stuff you had, you're like your books and stuff in there and your maps and they like
[2328.92 --> 2330.62]  actually mattered and yada, yada, yada.
[2331.40 --> 2335.20]  So it's actually, it's, it's, it's a surprisingly good, even like he has a video on the, the
[2335.20 --> 2341.24]  chicken-o-meter and like there was so much stuff about games and like the idea of the chicken-o-meter
[2341.24 --> 2346.88]  where this like, uh, the, the, the quality of the picture of this chicken indicated how
[2346.88 --> 2351.42]  much health you had and how that turned into like different forms of modern health bars
[2351.42 --> 2353.02]  and all this kind of stuff is super interesting.
[2355.92 --> 2356.32]  Anyways.
[2358.26 --> 2364.32]  There it's, but that's like, I mean, you look at the upload schedule, that's really hard
[2364.32 --> 2365.16]  content to make.
[2366.20 --> 2366.64]  Yeah.
[2366.64 --> 2369.60]  It takes a crazy amount of research.
[2369.86 --> 2370.96]  And what's the hell?
[2371.04 --> 2375.30]  Actually, that's another really good point is gaming is something that people are really
[2375.30 --> 2376.02]  passionate about.
[2376.24 --> 2381.32]  It's something that people would do in their free time, whether they were paid or not.
[2381.48 --> 2388.64]  And so anytime you work in an industry where somebody else would do it for free, that's
[2388.64 --> 2389.64]  what you're up against.
[2390.08 --> 2396.40]  You're up against what someone else would do for free with money as no object, right?
[2396.40 --> 2402.84]  Like that was, that was a big challenge for us moving into the tech spaces, the, is tech
[2402.84 --> 2403.74]  coverage.
[2403.74 --> 2407.58]  I mean, actually, I think you're probably seeing this more now, now that video production
[2407.58 --> 2412.80]  equipment has gotten so accessible and so affordable is that there are tech channels springing up
[2412.80 --> 2417.18]  everywhere that make no sense from a financial standpoint.
[2417.18 --> 2420.72]  Like you look at how many videos they upload, you look at their viewership, you can, you can
[2420.72 --> 2425.74]  reverse calculate how much revenue they're making and how many hours it takes to do all this.
[2425.74 --> 2428.36]  And you're like, oh, okay, you're making less than minimum wage, right?
[2428.38 --> 2429.46]  And that's not a bad thing.
[2429.54 --> 2433.42]  People should absolutely, you know, want to try to build something, right?
[2433.48 --> 2436.74]  Like they should do a side hustle or, you know, whatever, right?
[2436.74 --> 2438.26]  Like I'm not, I'm not criticizing this.
[2438.58 --> 2443.14]  I'm just saying that whenever you work in an industry where people would do it out of sheer
[2443.14 --> 2451.20]  passion, you are going to be up against people who are just doing stuff with no sort of thought
[2451.20 --> 2454.62]  to the financial sensibility of the approach that they're taking.
[2455.32 --> 2460.96]  So gaming is a space that really, I think, suffers from that.
[2460.96 --> 2467.68]  If you're trying to put together like a content strategy with, you know, paid professionals
[2467.68 --> 2473.14]  who expect vacation time and, you know, regular working hours.
[2473.48 --> 2473.94]  Career progression.
[2474.26 --> 2474.42]  Yeah.
[2474.58 --> 2475.10]  Promotions.
[2475.38 --> 2475.94]  Exactly.
[2476.12 --> 2476.94]  Cost of living.
[2477.38 --> 2478.36]  Wage increases.
[2481.90 --> 2483.00]  Is it on all right?
[2484.44 --> 2484.92]  Okay.
[2485.26 --> 2485.68]  Well, it's bad.
[2485.74 --> 2485.88]  Cool.
[2485.88 --> 2493.98]  Trying to run that up against just like some dude bros hanging out in their basement, like
[2493.98 --> 2497.50]  running a gaming podcast, playing video games and running a podcast or something in their
[2497.50 --> 2498.00]  free time.
[2498.36 --> 2499.56]  Doing it because I think it's entertaining.
[2499.98 --> 2502.98]  It's, it's, it's really, it's really, really tough.
[2505.26 --> 2508.08]  So, you know, I, I wish the team luck.
[2508.08 --> 2513.28]  Oh, you look at the most desirable career path in North America right now, which is YouTuber.
[2513.28 --> 2518.88]  You look at what like basically everyone likes doing, which is playing video games.
[2519.42 --> 2520.42]  And like, what is it?
[2520.44 --> 2525.48]  Every high school not going to have like their own aspirational gaming YouTubers.
[2526.30 --> 2526.78]  Yeah.
[2527.12 --> 2533.62]  It's going to be everywhere that like when I worked at Best Buy back in the day, my like
[2533.62 --> 2537.52]  group of friends at Best Buy tried to start a gaming news website.
[2537.84 --> 2538.32]  Yeah.
[2538.46 --> 2540.16]  And so did, oh, I don't know.
[2540.36 --> 2541.42]  Everyone else.
[2541.42 --> 2543.84]  Like it was, it was crazy back then.
[2544.00 --> 2549.78]  A guy I knew at NCIX did like some contract work for a friend of his who, uh, I wonder
[2549.78 --> 2550.66]  if it's still around.
[2552.04 --> 2554.10]  Uh, I think it's called Game Explain.
[2554.58 --> 2557.54]  I was going to say, I even know what you're talking about, but I didn't remember the name.
[2558.24 --> 2559.02]  Game Explain.
[2559.38 --> 2559.98]  Here, let's see.
[2560.06 --> 2561.32]  Let's see if, I look at that.
[2561.48 --> 2563.68]  Game Explain totally still exists.
[2563.68 --> 2570.62]  And does little videos about stuff.
[2570.68 --> 2573.04]  We know who developed Super Mario RPG remake apparently.
[2573.42 --> 2574.42]  So there's that.
[2574.56 --> 2574.84]  Okay.
[2575.18 --> 2575.48]  Yeah.
[2575.82 --> 2576.24]  There you go.
[2576.36 --> 2576.74]  Game Explain.
[2576.98 --> 2577.38]  Yeah.
[2577.64 --> 2578.10]  Tom.
[2579.26 --> 2580.48]  Tom from NCIX.
[2580.94 --> 2581.94]  When's the game coming out?
[2583.04 --> 2583.92]  Oh, Super Mario RPG.
[2584.10 --> 2585.12]  Have you've never played it, right?
[2585.22 --> 2586.04]  No, no, no, no, no.
[2586.04 --> 2586.48]  Not that.
[2586.60 --> 2587.06]  Tom's game.
[2587.66 --> 2590.12]  Uh, oh, I don't know when Carpoon is coming out.
[2590.26 --> 2590.58]  Okay.
[2591.78 --> 2592.18]  Yeah.
[2592.28 --> 2594.12]  Uh, one of my ex-colleagues from NCIX.
[2594.12 --> 2596.64]  Whoa, these guys are pumping content.
[2596.90 --> 2597.50]  Oh, Game Explain?
[2597.68 --> 2598.02]  Oh, yeah.
[2600.02 --> 2601.32]  Three videos a day?
[2602.30 --> 2602.66]  Carpoon!
[2603.52 --> 2604.20]  Chill, bro.
[2604.22 --> 2605.44]  Uh, we played this at Whale Land.
[2605.50 --> 2606.44]  It was actually really fun.
[2606.84 --> 2607.42]  Oh, nice.
[2607.52 --> 2608.08]  Yeah, developer.
[2608.50 --> 2609.28]  Tom Arnold.
[2609.84 --> 2610.24]  Yeah.
[2610.44 --> 2610.86]  Love it.
[2611.26 --> 2611.62]  Really?
[2611.72 --> 2612.12]  This guy?
[2614.86 --> 2615.22]  Yep.
[2615.42 --> 2616.26]  No, just kidding.
[2616.30 --> 2616.62]  Not him.
[2616.62 --> 2617.74]  No, that's him.
[2618.00 --> 2619.28]  Totally different Tom Arnold.
[2619.42 --> 2625.00]  So basically, you, um, you harpoon, you harpoon cars and you, you tow them to the crusher.
[2625.32 --> 2626.44]  Uh, there's multiplayer.
[2627.28 --> 2630.16]  Um, yeah, it's, you can do like time trials.
[2630.32 --> 2630.72]  It's fun.
[2632.66 --> 2633.10]  Okay.
[2633.22 --> 2637.10]  I just want to set this straight because at least one person in Flowplane chat is, is commenting
[2637.10 --> 2637.56]  about it.
[2637.80 --> 2640.82]  Uh, we're not saying that people shouldn't aspirationally do things.
[2640.82 --> 2646.04]  We're saying if you're trying to run one of these things as a, as a company, that it's
[2646.04 --> 2650.94]  a difficult spot to try to hold because of the amount of people coming for your throat
[2650.94 --> 2652.04]  because they want to do it.
[2652.20 --> 2652.52]  Yeah.
[2652.52 --> 2654.82]  Um, which is, which is fine.
[2654.90 --> 2658.90]  It just means you're in a highly competitive space and you're competing against people
[2658.90 --> 2664.76]  that are just in often cases happy to not receive a salary because they want to do this
[2664.76 --> 2668.46]  out of just passion, which again is fine.
[2668.58 --> 2669.00]  It's fine.
[2669.00 --> 2675.20]  It just means you have to be really good because you need to be able to give your people career,
[2675.30 --> 2677.90]  both growth, promotions, all this other type of stuff.
[2678.36 --> 2684.50]  Um, and make enough money to survive and make enough money to go up against people who might
[2684.50 --> 2688.14]  not care about making any money and make enough money to be able to have a war chest just in
[2688.14 --> 2690.94]  case things go poorly, all this other type, but like run like a real company.
[2691.08 --> 2695.70]  So people might see your content that has, you know, a whole bunch of, let's say hypothetically
[2695.70 --> 2699.94]  that has more sponsorships in it than someone else's.
[2700.34 --> 2702.88]  Um, and people might go, well, I'm not going to watch that.
[2702.92 --> 2704.06]  I just got sponsorships all over.
[2704.10 --> 2705.16]  I'm going to watch this other thing.
[2705.22 --> 2706.84]  And it's like, well, right.
[2706.88 --> 2712.10]  But they'll have them eventually when they, when they need to take a break to, you know,
[2712.10 --> 2714.06]  shower and brush their teeth once in a while.
[2714.06 --> 2718.20]  And they're not in just like grind it startup mode, right?
[2718.20 --> 2720.70]  Like it's, it's a natural evolution.
[2720.70 --> 2723.54]  And so, uh, we did it, right?
[2723.54 --> 2725.66]  Like, I'm not, I'm not saying you shouldn't try.
[2725.80 --> 2729.20]  I think people are taking some of the wrong, like someone, someone said competition breeds
[2729.20 --> 2729.70]  quality.
[2729.80 --> 2729.92]  Yeah.
[2729.94 --> 2732.12]  We're also not saying that competition is bad.
[2732.12 --> 2734.64]  Like just, we're not saying any of that stuff.
[2734.72 --> 2735.76]  Holy shit, guys.
[2736.26 --> 2737.40]  Please get it together.
[2737.48 --> 2738.60]  I said, I like hamburgers.
[2738.62 --> 2739.94]  I didn't say I hate hot dogs.
[2740.16 --> 2740.56]  Exactly.
[2741.02 --> 2741.46]  Yes.
[2742.72 --> 2746.18]  We're just saying it's very, it's a very competitive space to be in.
[2746.30 --> 2746.64]  That's all.
[2747.12 --> 2747.50]  Yes.
[2747.64 --> 2749.32]  Not saying it's bad, all that kind of stuff.
[2749.32 --> 2753.06]  Clearly, I, I, I mean, I've called out multiple creators already in the show.
[2753.14 --> 2754.10]  They're all doing great.
[2754.88 --> 2757.30]  Um, yeah, I don't know.
[2760.50 --> 2763.90]  I just think to bring it all the way back around, like if you're going to come in and
[2763.90 --> 2770.58]  buy one of these companies and then ax their editor in chief and then see an exodus of like
[2770.58 --> 2771.98]  all the talent.
[2773.44 --> 2775.34]  Maybe you should have done some due diligence.
[2775.34 --> 2776.02]  Yeah.
[2776.14 --> 2777.46]  Like that's not going to work, dude.
[2777.78 --> 2779.84]  Escapist is like super dead now.
[2780.20 --> 2785.60]  Um, at least their video side, but then the other side looks like that already.
[2785.82 --> 2786.06]  Yeah.
[2786.18 --> 2791.46]  And, and to be clear, I don't know a lot about like externally evaluating performance of
[2791.46 --> 2796.42]  static news websites, but when I see the zero comments on most posts and like less than
[2796.42 --> 2799.32]  five on all the ones that do have comments, I get concerned.
[2799.44 --> 2802.86]  I saw someone ask like, Oh, but it doesn't create and making it, do you have to have an
[2802.86 --> 2803.82]  account to be able to comment?
[2803.82 --> 2805.38]  Like it's like, does that matter?
[2805.50 --> 2808.92]  Like if enough people are frequenting this website, you'd think a handful of them would
[2808.92 --> 2809.50]  have accounts.
[2809.64 --> 2815.58]  Like I have seen sites, news sites that require an account that have a bunch of comments on
[2815.58 --> 2815.74]  it.
[2815.78 --> 2817.04]  Like this is a thing.
[2817.12 --> 2817.92]  People will do it.
[2818.66 --> 2826.46]  Um, if it's not even worth botting the comments on your site, like yikes, I don't know.
[2826.46 --> 2829.92]  You know what I do know is what merch messages are.
[2830.08 --> 2835.52]  Hey, it's time to explain how to, uh, how to support our, you know, awful.
[2835.84 --> 2838.66]  What, what, what were we, what were we, what made us bad people?
[2838.74 --> 2842.04]  I forget because we don't think other people should do something, whatever.
[2842.04 --> 2848.80]  The point is, you know, our, our awful, you know, people who have vacation time and, you
[2848.80 --> 2854.00]  know, snacks in office and all the other, you know, things that we have that, uh, that
[2854.00 --> 2855.16]  you should hate us for.
[2855.50 --> 2856.94]  Um, Hey, merch messages.
[2857.24 --> 2857.44]  Woo.
[2857.44 --> 2861.12]  The way to interact with the show is not to send a super chat, not to send a Twitch
[2861.12 --> 2862.08]  bit or whatever.
[2862.24 --> 2863.64]  I don't know even how those work.
[2863.76 --> 2865.08]  I still don't.
[2865.08 --> 2865.84]  I do that.
[2865.88 --> 2869.56]  Like spiel every time I talk about merch messages and every time I think.
[2870.34 --> 2871.02]  I should look that up.
[2871.06 --> 2873.80]  Maybe at some point I should look it up so that I don't just sound like, you know,
[2873.86 --> 2874.62]  I think you shouldn't.
[2874.72 --> 2877.76]  An out of, an out of touch boomer, boom, boom tuber.
[2878.06 --> 2881.14]  It's just junkie game microtransactions that you buy bits and you give them out.
[2881.34 --> 2881.92]  Oh, that's stupid.
[2881.92 --> 2883.88]  Instead of giving money directly, you just buy bits and give them out.
[2883.88 --> 2887.28]  You should just use real currency so that you aren't obfuscating.
[2887.28 --> 2888.00]  How much you're spending.
[2888.44 --> 2888.56]  Yeah.
[2889.04 --> 2889.60]  Oh, cool.
[2889.78 --> 2890.98]  Well, Twitch bits are stupid then.
[2891.04 --> 2891.46]  Don't buy them.
[2891.68 --> 2896.32]  What you should do is buy merch messages, which you buy by just going to ltdstore.com,
[2896.44 --> 2899.92]  finding something cool that you like, that you actually want.
[2900.00 --> 2903.52]  So you're not just wasting your money by hucking it at the screen, throwing that in your cart
[2903.52 --> 2905.44]  and then filling out a merch message.
[2905.52 --> 2908.96]  A little box will pop up when we're live and it'll either go to producer Dan.
[2909.08 --> 2914.32]  Well, it'll always go to producer Dan and then he will either pop it down there or forward
[2914.32 --> 2919.10]  it to someone who can help you out or send it to us to address on the show.
[2919.16 --> 2919.90]  It'll be awesome.
[2919.98 --> 2920.22]  Oh, yeah.
[2920.26 --> 2921.24]  Sometimes he also replies.
[2921.34 --> 2922.24]  He's about to say something.
[2922.54 --> 2923.04]  Go ahead, Dan.
[2923.88 --> 2924.20]  Hi.
[2925.04 --> 2925.56]  Got him.
[2925.56 --> 2935.88]  The point is that when you check out, your message will come to us and we're going to
[2935.88 --> 2939.70]  sometimes read them and Dan picked a few for us to read and he's going to go ahead and hit
[2939.70 --> 2940.28]  us with those.
[2940.74 --> 2941.00]  Sure.
[2941.12 --> 2942.66]  Let's start off with this one here.
[2943.04 --> 2943.50]  Hi, Linus.
[2943.54 --> 2945.88]  We have seen a bit more of your kids in the home videos.
[2946.12 --> 2951.10]  Curious, as they get older, have they expressed any interest in joining the LTT team in any
[2951.10 --> 2953.72]  capacity, be it co-host or anything else?
[2953.72 --> 2955.52]  I mean, they're kids, right?
[2955.64 --> 2963.08]  So they'll talk about inheriting mom and dad's company, not really understanding what that
[2963.08 --> 2966.22]  means, that we'd be dead and stuff like that, right?
[2966.28 --> 2966.94]  They're little kids.
[2969.12 --> 2975.98]  My eldest has asked, okay, so am I going to run the company at some point?
[2976.26 --> 2981.00]  And my answer has always been, I don't know, are you going to get good at it at some point?
[2981.00 --> 2981.36]  Right?
[2981.46 --> 2984.62]  Like, I don't really believe in nepotism.
[2984.94 --> 2990.56]  And just because you might be a primary shareholder someday doesn't necessarily mean that you have
[2990.56 --> 2993.84]  any business whatsoever interfering with the day-to-day operations.
[2994.48 --> 2995.72]  I mean, I don't even know.
[2995.84 --> 3005.98]  By the time I died, right, would I have just aged out of this to the point where I were completely
[3005.98 --> 3010.24]  stepped back and would have no kind of business interfering in the day-to-day operations.
[3010.24 --> 3015.62]  And it's just a team that builds a sustainable model here that is separate from me.
[3015.70 --> 3018.34]  Like, I don't know what an exit strategy looks like for me.
[3018.40 --> 3021.04]  If I wanted an exit strategy, we had a big offer a while back.
[3021.08 --> 3021.94]  I would have just taken it.
[3022.06 --> 3022.22]  Yeah.
[3022.76 --> 3025.00]  We're also in, we don't know what it's going to look like.
[3025.36 --> 3027.16]  Like, what the heck is this going to look like?
[3027.16 --> 3029.94]  Like, it's only been 11 years.
[3032.02 --> 3035.06]  We want to ask you what it's going to look like when you're talking about when you're
[3035.06 --> 3035.42]  dead.
[3035.80 --> 3035.86]  Like.
[3035.98 --> 3037.08]  It's changed so much.
[3037.16 --> 3037.34]  Yeah.
[3037.40 --> 3038.48]  Like, what the heck?
[3038.60 --> 3040.84]  I mean, Nintendo used to make playing cards.
[3041.40 --> 3041.80]  Yeah.
[3042.10 --> 3042.46]  Like.
[3042.82 --> 3045.84]  If we have, you know, real legs, right?
[3045.84 --> 3052.50]  Like, if this company can build a culture and build processes and build a business model
[3052.50 --> 3053.86]  that is sustainable for the long term.
[3053.86 --> 3056.62]  Like, do we even make videos anymore in 10 years?
[3056.72 --> 3057.86]  There's some quote about how.
[3058.12 --> 3058.46]  In five years.
[3058.62 --> 3059.06]  About how.
[3059.50 --> 3060.64]  Or do we just make water bottles?
[3060.88 --> 3067.60]  A lot of big companies, they end up dying because they do really well and then they stagnate
[3067.60 --> 3072.98]  and they don't want to, they don't want to pursue change or evolution because what's
[3072.98 --> 3076.74]  been working has been working and then they end up just falling amongst their own weight.
[3077.28 --> 3081.16]  And there's a quote about that that's like, if you're going to be cannibalized, it's best
[3081.16 --> 3082.22]  to cannibalize yourself.
[3082.36 --> 3082.50]  Yeah.
[3082.50 --> 3084.52]  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's the innovator's dilemma.
[3084.86 --> 3085.02]  Yeah.
[3085.14 --> 3090.66]  Um, which it, it's better for me to not try to summarize it because I'm a little rusty
[3090.66 --> 3096.50]  on exactly the wording, but basically, uh, the innovator's dilemma is, um, sort of a
[3096.50 --> 3102.32]  business principle or guideline or, um, I don't know what the right word for it would be right
[3102.32 --> 3111.98]  now, but it's, it's a, it's a challenge that you face where it's almost never the best, uh,
[3111.98 --> 3118.98]  most sensible use of your investment resources to cannibalize your own business because it
[3118.98 --> 3124.90]  would cost so much of your existing business for so little gain that it could never be worth
[3124.90 --> 3131.82]  it. Um, so you end up with smaller competitors who do chase that innovation and who scale past you
[3131.82 --> 3136.62]  in a way that is difficult for you to respond to because you didn't make those early investments
[3136.62 --> 3142.58]  because you got comfortable just doing your, your regular thing. That's a terrible, terrible
[3142.58 --> 3145.40]  summary, but sort of fundamentally kind of what it is.
[3145.40 --> 3151.52]  Yeah. So essentially if we're still doing the exact same thing we're doing now in 20 years,
[3151.52 --> 3154.76]  like we messed up big time.
[3155.08 --> 3160.84]  This is, uh, this is something, uh, uh, while Linus is a dick to his kids, I hope they end
[3160.84 --> 3167.28]  up working for Nvidia to spite him. I hope you're joking because for me to be nice to my kids by just
[3167.28 --> 3172.14]  like putting them in charge of this company would be being a complete dick to all the people who
[3172.14 --> 3175.98]  worked hard to build expertise and make their way.
[3175.98 --> 3179.76]  You don't have to learn anything. Grats, you graduated high school. I guess you're running
[3179.76 --> 3185.00]  the whole company. I'd just be like, all right, Linus went insane. I'm out. Right. Like I,
[3185.20 --> 3191.12]  yeah, like that's, that's so stupid. Um, yes, I was joking. Okay, cool. Sounds good. The problem
[3191.12 --> 3196.94]  with that type of joking on the internet is like some people won't be. Yeah. So you, you like,
[3197.00 --> 3201.74]  actually, I know it sucks, but like you actually have to be careful about certain comments like this.
[3201.74 --> 3206.98]  Look no, look no further than, you know, just some of the, some of the dumb comments we've had to
[3206.98 --> 3215.64]  read lately. Yeah. All right, Dan. Look no further than any form of political discourse on the internet.
[3215.76 --> 3223.36]  I'm amazed you have any brain power left. Yeah, I know. Can you please explain P and E cores on Intel?
[3223.36 --> 3230.94]  Not convinced they work as Plex's transcoder kept only using the efficiency cores. Or, yeah. Is it, uh,
[3230.94 --> 3235.22]  up to the program or Windows scheduler to properly manage when a P core is used?
[3235.50 --> 3242.76]  Uh, my understanding is that's down to CPU microcode and the Windows scheduler. I don't believe
[3242.76 --> 3251.26]  a program, uh, would decide what cores it would use. What you might want to do is I forget what it's,
[3251.40 --> 3256.04]  shoot, I forget what it's called. Uh, but there's an application that you can use for
[3256.04 --> 3264.40]  manually, uh, manually altering processor affinity or, or, uh, setting core pinning. So you can pin
[3264.40 --> 3271.96]  processors to a particular core, uh, but the core pinning windows, can you just do it from within
[3271.96 --> 3279.22]  Windows? Overall? I haven't tried to do it in a very, very, very long time just because, um, there were
[3279.22 --> 3287.02]  some cases where, oh man, at some point I think you could like manually set frequencies per core,
[3287.02 --> 3293.00]  uh, but they weren't dynamic boosting yet. And so you could like set your game to run on a particular,
[3293.00 --> 3296.68]  like the core that overclocks the best or whatever. Like I, I don't know, at some point I cared about
[3296.68 --> 3301.50]  that. Yeah. I did a lot of that with a tool when I had a thread ripper. It was very critical.
[3301.74 --> 3304.30]  Pretty sure you've been able to do that in task manager for years.
[3304.30 --> 3310.40]  Maybe affinity, but not like individual core process lasso. That's the one. Yeah. Process lasso.
[3310.48 --> 3314.80]  That's the one you want. And yeah, with thread ripper, that could be very necessary, not for
[3314.80 --> 3320.56]  gaming, but just because, uh, you might end up with a situation where if you have a process that's
[3320.56 --> 3326.92]  running across two CCDs, you can end up with, um, inter die communication, really slowing it down
[3326.92 --> 3331.86]  compared to if you have the whole thing running on a single CCD. So there, there are reasons to do it.
[3331.86 --> 3335.62]  Uh, process lasso apparently is the way to do it. Dan, do you want to hit us with one more
[3335.62 --> 3338.80]  before we move on? Process lasso used to be a pretty big deal for certain games.
[3339.30 --> 3343.24]  Yeah, it would, it did help with some games for me at least. I mean, oh God, I hate that CPU.
[3343.82 --> 3350.14]  Um, let's see what else we got there. Hi, WAN.dll. I'm a computer assisted design instructor at a
[3350.14 --> 3354.44]  public university. What do you think about the fact that 80% of my students can't tell the
[3354.44 --> 3358.70]  difference between a zip file and a folder and don't know how to unzip?
[3361.86 --> 3371.64]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, here's a question for you. Okay. Now I know you're a CAD instructor.
[3371.64 --> 3380.78]  And so if we were to specifically talk about a CAD course 20 years ago, probably everybody
[3380.78 --> 3389.94]  in it would know how to unzip a folder. But if we consider how much more broadly people use
[3389.94 --> 3397.74]  computers and how much more of a normie you might find in a CAD course, not because they are into
[3397.74 --> 3406.52]  computers, but because they are into design, is the percentage of the population that would
[3406.52 --> 3412.66]  understand the difference between a folder and a zip file and know how to unzip files any
[3412.66 --> 3415.62]  different today than it was then? I would say probably it's higher today.
[3415.62 --> 3424.42]  And I have nothing to back this up other than just that it's a much more normal thing for you
[3424.42 --> 3430.62]  to have possibly encountered. Like my mother has encountered a zip file in her life at this point.
[3430.66 --> 3434.42]  Whereas back then I did like, I don't, I don't necessarily think she would have.
[3434.78 --> 3438.38]  I just think like, like you've talked on the show before about how typing speeds
[3438.38 --> 3449.20]  of some of the, the young people these days is kind of slow. Um, and, uh, Gero Ninja in
[3449.20 --> 3453.94]  flow plane chat said, bring back computer literacy courses. I think there's maybe a sweet spot there.
[3454.46 --> 3460.76]  Um, if we're assuming that keyboards are keyboards that you use this way, not keyboards on a phone,
[3460.76 --> 3467.02]  um, are going to be a thing for the next while. I do think we should probably teach people how to
[3467.02 --> 3473.18]  type because the amount of efficiency loss is like insane. It's actually kind of mind blowing to me.
[3473.24 --> 3477.48]  Like maybe I feel like this is one of those things where people are going to just think that I'm a
[3477.48 --> 3485.36]  complete a**hole or something because I can't help it. I watch an employee working.
[3486.72 --> 3487.98]  Oh yeah. That drives me nuts.
[3487.98 --> 3499.14]  Like this. And I kind of go, I am actually, you are actually completing 20% as much work
[3499.14 --> 3510.18]  as someone who knows how to do this. Um, and yet you make the same. How does that make any sense?
[3510.32 --> 3513.10]  Like I just, I think it sort of depends on what they do.
[3513.10 --> 3519.16]  Yeah. I understand why it bothers you though. Should I just start doing like
[3519.16 --> 3524.06]  hunt and peck for merch messages? Anytime Linus comes around to start typing that way,
[3524.12 --> 3529.90]  just drive him nuts. I don't know. But I think having some amount of that type of stuff
[3529.90 --> 3537.34]  still be in schools and whatnot makes sense. Doesn't it bother them to be going so slow? How could you,
[3537.44 --> 3542.62]  how can you get anything done? And to be clear, we have people here who do a great job actually,
[3542.62 --> 3548.96]  in spite of that because most of what they do at their computer isn't typing. Yeah. It's highly
[3548.96 --> 3555.24]  creative or whatever else. Or clicking on things. It's just that for me, like my, we can't help it,
[3555.26 --> 3560.58]  right? Like we, we see the world through our own biases, through our own lens. Right. And for me,
[3560.58 --> 3567.64]  the main work that I do at a computer is emails or writing. If I typed at that rate,
[3567.64 --> 3573.98]  the lights wouldn't be on in this building, this company wouldn't exist. It's not possible. Like
[3573.98 --> 3577.76]  it. I do also think there are people that do surprisingly technical things at the computer
[3577.76 --> 3583.38]  that type very infrequently though. Um, yeah. So I agree with you. If I typed that slowly,
[3583.48 --> 3587.60]  similarly to you, a lot of my work is emails and stuff. If I typed that slowly, I'd be screwed.
[3587.60 --> 3595.42]  Yeah. Like it wouldn't work. I could not do what I do at all. So I don't know. Yeah. Teaching stuff
[3595.42 --> 3600.88]  like typing, I think would still be good. Honestly, if, if I had a kid and they were in school and they
[3600.88 --> 3607.88]  had to learn like what zip files were, I would just think that's stupid. Really? Most people,
[3608.00 --> 3611.14]  it's never going to matter. Interesting. Who cares?
[3611.14 --> 3618.66]  But it does matter. Like, okay. To who? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, look.
[3620.74 --> 3625.08]  Okay. I ran into. How long does it take to learn and how Googleable is that? I ran into this.
[3625.08 --> 3629.46]  This isn't a skill. You don't have to practice it. No, it matters. Okay. You can Google one time
[3629.46 --> 3634.62]  what the heck a zip file is. What do I need to open this? Right click extract. Just not allowed to
[3634.62 --> 3638.90]  talk. I'm just lagging. So I can't tell that you're. Yeah. No, why don't you just, you know what?
[3638.90 --> 3643.18]  Why don't you just do the rest of the show? No problem. Um, okay. I did run into a situation
[3643.18 --> 3650.16]  recently where it mattered to understand and having an understanding would help to troubleshoot
[3650.16 --> 3655.06]  a problem. Okay. But you can't cover every single aspect of life that way. So you have to pick and
[3655.06 --> 3660.18]  choose your battles. And I don't think this is a battle to pick. Someone was trying to execute a setup
[3660.18 --> 3668.42]  file of some sort and it wouldn't, it wouldn't run because it was inside a compressed folder.
[3668.42 --> 3672.42]  I don't know if it was dot zip or dot raw. I don't care. It doesn't matter. It was inside
[3672.42 --> 3678.74]  a compressed folder. And the reason it wouldn't run was because one of the dependencies was in
[3678.74 --> 3688.74]  the compressed folder and was not decompressed. Then shortly afterward, I watched someone unzip
[3688.74 --> 3695.20]  a single full file from a compressed folder so that they could execute it. And I told them,
[3695.20 --> 3700.66]  I was like, Hey, you don't need to do that. Yeah. If there's more than one file in the zip folder,
[3700.66 --> 3705.56]  you must decompress it first because it can't reference the other, then execute it. If there's
[3705.56 --> 3710.44]  only one, then you can just execute it and it will decompress and execute because all the dependencies
[3710.44 --> 3715.48]  are contained. And they were like, Whoa. And this is a pretty technical person.
[3715.48 --> 3720.94]  They're a pretty technical person and it didn't matter to them up to that point. That's an
[3720.94 --> 3724.96]  interesting point. Think about how much time, very interesting. Think about how much time they
[3724.96 --> 3730.68]  could save in their life. If every time they had to execute something from within a compressed folder,
[3730.68 --> 3735.06]  they could have known they don't have to decompress it first. They can just double click it. Yeah.
[3735.06 --> 3738.82]  Like a couple minutes. That'd be sick. All that time back. That'd be dope.
[3741.44 --> 3746.52]  Yeah. So I don't think we should teach those types of things in, in schools anymore. I think,
[3746.60 --> 3752.24]  I think we should teach genuinely. I think we should teach like how to look up information
[3752.24 --> 3759.22]  and avoid trash information on the internet. That would be like a really useful thing.
[3759.34 --> 3763.50]  You're basically asking for common sense class. Who would you find to teach it?
[3763.50 --> 3769.54]  Isn't that like supposed to be what? That's what we had cap career and personal planning.
[3769.66 --> 3773.52]  Yeah. It's something similar. I don't remember what it's called. I'm not sure how it happened,
[3773.58 --> 3778.14]  but I'm pretty sure. It was the easiest class. I think in my entire time at my high school,
[3778.14 --> 3784.44]  I attended cap class like less than 10 times and not because I skipped class. Like we just never had
[3784.44 --> 3788.28]  it. I think ours was just called portfolio or something. I don't even know what that means.
[3788.50 --> 3792.50]  Yeah. Oh, like, like career, like, like, like your personal portfolio.
[3792.50 --> 3798.18]  Like actually made like a binder. That was like a portfolio. I think if someone came in for an
[3798.18 --> 3803.96]  interview, they brought one of those, I would make this in my high school class. Yeah. I, um,
[3804.88 --> 3812.66]  you know what? I'd look at it. I'd look at it. Would you be mean? No, I'm not. Would you be a
[3812.66 --> 3819.22]  mean person? No, no. Would you go through and roast this person's effort? No. What? What? What if they got?
[3821.62 --> 3823.66]  Doesn't matter if it would be funny, Dan.
[3825.04 --> 3829.88]  That is not a nice thing to do when someone doesn't have a real world experience.
[3830.12 --> 3836.22]  I want to dig up my high school portfolio and I, I, I guarantee you it's gone. This is not a dig upable
[3836.22 --> 3841.84]  thing. We should dig up your resume. That's dig upable. That's every once in a while I run into
[3841.84 --> 3848.28]  this. It's so funny. It's have we ever gone through it on the show? I don't know. I'm kind
[3848.28 --> 3853.10]  of curious. I'm like having secondhand cringe over here. Are you sure about this Luke? I don't care.
[3853.16 --> 3859.50]  Okay. Yeah. I'm sure it's funny. Have I ever like emailed it to you or something like that?
[3859.62 --> 3864.16]  No, I have it. It's in my email. Oh, no way. I emailed it to you. Did you really? Yeah.
[3864.16 --> 3870.44]  Yeah. Hold on. Let's see. How do you think I sent it to you? Oh man. A keyword like resume
[3870.44 --> 3875.50]  is not going to be. Tech tips, assistant application. Shut up. You've got it. Okay. Well, hold on.
[3875.56 --> 3879.42]  Hold on. Okay. Send it to my. Hi, Luke. Thanks for sending your resume. No, no, no, no. Send it to
[3879.42 --> 3887.74]  the thing. Send it to the thing. Okay. Hold on. Potential for employment. Who is that? Man, the keyword
[3887.74 --> 3892.90]  resume brings up a lot of stuff. Yeah. See, the thing that helps me is it's my personal email.
[3892.90 --> 3898.64]  Oh, got it. Yeah. So if I searched your name and resume, there's really only like one thing.
[3898.72 --> 3905.64]  Got it. Yeah. I don't. Yeah. People are saying don't show on screen. Yeah. Don't show on screen.
[3906.18 --> 3910.02]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, oh wait, does it have like actual personal information?
[3910.36 --> 3912.68]  I don't know. It just might. So it's like, no. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.
[3912.68 --> 3916.80]  And it would be from back then. So it might be like my parents address and stuff. Sure. Sure. Sure.
[3916.80 --> 3925.06]  So I just like, yeah. Um, okay. So you're the other one. Okay. I'm the other one. Well,
[3925.12 --> 3929.60]  okay. I'm trying to figure out what that's all I am to you. The other one. I've done a full
[3929.60 --> 3936.22]  blank, so it can't happen accidentally. Hey, nice. Good job, Dan. Thank you. Boom. Okay.
[3936.22 --> 3946.40]  So I wasn't lying. God, let me turn it off. Oh no. Yeah, we're fine. Nice. Oh my God. And in your email to me,
[3946.40 --> 3953.08]  it has the code of my original email, which has a Google drive link in it. No way. Unfortunately,
[3953.08 --> 3959.20]  your portfolio. No, it's my, are you sure? Yeah. Cause it sounds like it could be still
[3959.20 --> 3965.86]  works. It's my, it's my actual, actual resume. It's not the application. Okay. So Linus sent,
[3965.86 --> 3970.56]  you'll see this in a second. The application, it has my WPM on it. That's funny. Um, that's
[3970.56 --> 3974.36]  actually lower than I could type. I, that's weird. I don't know why I put that. Um,
[3974.36 --> 3980.64]  wow. That's really funny. I didn't know that. Um, yeah, but Linus, Linus got so many applications
[3980.64 --> 3984.44]  that he had people fill it like a form, but at first you just had people send in resumes.
[3984.98 --> 3991.40]  So I sent you a Google drive link of my resume and then I did a photo bucket link of pictures.
[3991.40 --> 3996.26]  So those are definitely gone. Okay. I'm bringing, yeah, those are gone. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh,
[3996.44 --> 4003.38]  okay. Dan, I actually do need my screen back. Photo bucket. See you later, buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Those are,
[4003.38 --> 4011.22]  those are gone. Okay. What else we got here though? Um, can I just like, can I edit this? Can I just
[4011.22 --> 4015.94]  like delete things? No. Okay. That's not easy. Okay. Well here, let's do highlights of qualifications,
[4016.68 --> 4021.40]  extensive experience, building, repairing, and maintaining computers. Is this my resume? Sorry.
[4021.58 --> 4028.54]  Typing speed of 80 words per minute experience with air, liquid, and oil cooled computers. That was a lie
[4028.54 --> 4033.42]  at the time. I had literally never worked on a technically liquid cool. Yeah. I worked on oil
[4033.42 --> 4041.38]  Yeah. I think we figured that out when we tried to do this video. Uh, here, hold on. I'm going to find
[4041.38 --> 4053.08]  it because I was pretty annoyed. Um, because I left him just to like work on water. Oh, Dan.
[4053.08 --> 4058.16]  Wait, was this the water block thing? Cause you always misquote this. I left him to just work on
[4058.16 --> 4065.78]  this. And then I came back and he had gotten like, but all done. And I was like, yo, why is this taking
[4065.78 --> 4071.08]  so long? And he was just like, it's, I don't remember. I don't remember what you said. It
[4071.08 --> 4076.24]  doesn't matter. The point is it took a very long time and it was very clear that I was going to be
[4076.24 --> 4081.98]  the one who was going to actually get this computer water cooled. Not you. I, we've talked about this a few
[4081.98 --> 4086.82]  times and it's been long enough now that I'm forgetting points, but you've like always said
[4086.82 --> 4091.68]  it wrong. It's like, not what happened. I don't remember what it was. I think you gave me like,
[4092.20 --> 4096.50]  like this ended up taking you actually a super long time. And you thought I was going to be done
[4096.50 --> 4101.68]  in like an hour. And it took you like a day. And I, it never made any sense that you thought it was
[4101.68 --> 4105.98]  going to take me this short period of time. I mean, that's possible. I've never been good at
[4105.98 --> 4110.78]  estimating time, but what I do know is I definitely left you to do something. And I, it definitely
[4110.78 --> 4115.56]  seemed like not a lot of progress had been made. Yeah. But then you didn't even remotely
[4115.56 --> 4120.26]  get it done in that amount of time either. So I'm just saying, remember water cooled Ram.
[4120.46 --> 4127.02]  Yes. I think this is literally the only time I've ever seen it be done, I guess I should
[4127.02 --> 4133.10]  say. Cause I've seen it at like trade shows and stuff. Yeah. So dumb. The goal was that as
[4133.10 --> 4138.46]  many things as possible would be water cooled. And I wish I had held onto these, uh, these spreaders
[4138.46 --> 4144.92]  in this thing, not because I would ever use it for anything again, but it's just cool. It's cool.
[4145.04 --> 4150.06]  You just like you put thermal compound on the top of the heat spreader. And then you put this just
[4150.06 --> 4156.64]  block over top of the whole thing. You cool all the Ram like that. It's sick. Awesome.
[4157.58 --> 4161.66]  Where's part three, man? How many, remember when we did multi-part videos that sure made things
[4161.66 --> 4166.34]  easier, we should do more multi-part videos. Why do we not do that anymore? That's genius.
[4167.80 --> 4172.68]  Look how long this video is. It's like 23 minute video on plugging in tubing.
[4173.76 --> 4174.32]  Heck yeah.
[4174.40 --> 4175.14]  That's crazy.
[4177.02 --> 4181.64]  Man, do we ever get higher information density these days? Why am I wearing a headset?
[4181.64 --> 4183.92]  What a f***ing loser.
[4188.48 --> 4193.20]  It's amazing. All the little things that I'll see when I look back at an old video, I'm just
[4193.20 --> 4197.26]  like, ah, yeah, I didn't know what I was doing, but hey, cool. I tried. It's good.
[4201.68 --> 4207.32]  Anyway, what are we talking about? Oh, we need to do two more topics. Okay.
[4207.32 --> 4213.38]  We're on like my resume and stuff. Oh, right. Your resume. No, I want to talk about Luke's
[4213.38 --> 4222.28]  resume more. Um, okay. Uh, geek squad task force Langley, BC. Let's go. Worked with other
[4222.28 --> 4228.96]  agents to repair infected, broken and DOA computers. Let's go. Compiled a freeware software package
[4228.96 --> 4234.80]  for diagnostics. I did actually do that. Um, it was better than the one that they had and
[4234.80 --> 4239.64]  we actually used it in our entire department. Canada bread load trucks for distribution. Yep.
[4240.00 --> 4244.06]  Troubleshoot and maintain machines when required. Did you ever actually do any? I did actually do
[4244.06 --> 4248.70]  any IT maintenance for Canada bread. Uh, it was more than IT maintenance. It was like,
[4249.64 --> 4255.74]  like production line machines. I'm not even kidding. That's kind of sad. Why? That you needed
[4255.74 --> 4262.20]  to be the one to do that. Oh yeah. Yeah. So I would get like annoyed because they would be like,
[4262.20 --> 4268.08]  oh, we'll like fix it tomorrow. And I'm like, what, like what, what am I supposed to do?
[4269.46 --> 4275.62]  So I feel like it's very obvious what's wrong. This like does not require a mill, right? Because
[4275.62 --> 4279.90]  we had mill rights that would do like actual complicated things. Right. Like what I would
[4279.90 --> 4286.32]  be doing is very not like, I'm not some, uh, yeah, I don't know. But like there was, there was like,
[4286.32 --> 4291.62]  this thing is clearly broken and just needs to be like removed or bolt needs tightened or like
[4291.62 --> 4295.74]  something like very, very straightforward things. And everyone would just be like, nope, no one's
[4295.74 --> 4303.48]  going to do it. This is a very short resume. Yeah. I mean, oh, it's the assistant application
[4303.48 --> 4309.90]  that has a whole bunch more on it. Yeah. Do you have that one? It's in the thing. No,
[4309.90 --> 4316.14]  this is the blank one. So I create, I created this, uh, I created the, no, look at the attached
[4316.14 --> 4324.46]  document. I am. It's blank. Look. Um, are you sure? Yeah, it's completely blank. Trust me, Dan. It's
[4324.46 --> 4332.34]  fine. So here's the, here's the form, uh, job description, uh, you'll video editing may be
[4332.34 --> 4336.86]  required to be completed. No, it's not blank. You just opened the wrong one. Oh, well then maybe you
[4336.86 --> 4340.70]  should, you should get better at reading emails. Maybe they should teach a class about that in
[4340.70 --> 4345.56]  high school. Maybe they should teach a class on not including blank versions of documents and
[4345.56 --> 4353.74]  replies to people. I didn't look at the attachment from me. Sheesh. What a guy doesn't even know how
[4353.74 --> 4359.60]  to read the emails. Look, you clicked on this one, which was attached from you. If you click on this
[4359.60 --> 4366.12]  one, which is attached from me and I open it here, there's information in the doc. You just opened the
[4366.12 --> 4373.38]  wrong one. I only have one. Look, maybe you should learn to send emails. Maybe I did do that run.
[4375.52 --> 4379.64]  The best part is how hard you roasted me. Yeah, that's fair enough.
[4381.98 --> 4387.22]  Look guys, he's a little slow this week. He's like actually kind of stupid.
[4387.22 --> 4396.82]  It's great because I was like this when I got COVID last time. Like I could, I could tell I was still
[4396.82 --> 4402.98]  smart enough to recognize that I was not very smart. Yeah. It's like kind of really frustrating.
[4403.48 --> 4410.16]  Yeah. I was like, Oh man, this must be what it's like to be kind of a dull tool.
[4410.16 --> 4417.46]  God, that's so annoying. Like I'd just be like looking at something going, I should be able to figure this out.
[4417.46 --> 4420.68]  Why didn't it send you the whole chain? I don't know. It's actually really weird.
[4420.68 --> 4425.08]  Like I should be able to figure out this thing, but I can't. Okay, there, there.
[4425.16 --> 4430.60]  You know? And I was just struggling so much with things, it sucked.
[4430.60 --> 4433.76]  Whoa! Okay, so we had a landline.
[4434.60 --> 4435.04]  Yeah, yeah.
[4435.44 --> 4440.28]  This is how long ago that was. My parents' house had a landline.
[4440.44 --> 4443.48]  Nice. Nice. Hold on.
[4445.92 --> 4450.16]  Oh, the photo bucket's listed again. That's unfortunate.
[4450.52 --> 4456.08]  Transportation. Bus slash car. Car broken. And I will be getting a new one in December.
[4456.80 --> 4457.78]  Car broken.
[4457.78 --> 4464.08]  Bus slash broken car. Car broke.
[4466.12 --> 4470.90]  Oh man. I will be getting a new one in December. How did I think I was going to do that?
[4470.94 --> 4474.28]  Well, you probably lied just like all the other things you lied about.
[4475.22 --> 4478.14]  Video editing skills. Please explain your relevant experience.
[4478.14 --> 4478.82]  Oh boy.
[4479.08 --> 4485.56]  I have helped my brother create some Starcraft 2 casting video apostrophe S for YouTube.
[4485.56 --> 4488.22]  Yeah. Hey, I think that was actually true.
[4488.32 --> 4491.46]  I helped him create these in Sony Vegas Movie Studio.
[4491.74 --> 4492.78]  I think that was also true.
[4492.98 --> 4496.48]  I wouldn't say I have mastered the program by any means.
[4497.06 --> 4498.24]  Hey, I'm not lying yet.
[4498.32 --> 4504.02]  Although, anytime we have had a problem, I have been able to figure it out or use Google to find a simple solution.
[4504.28 --> 4504.90]  What a chat.
[4505.10 --> 4507.90]  A link to my brother's YouTube channel is linked below.
[4508.16 --> 4508.88]  We should hire him.
[4508.88 --> 4512.84]  So, you didn't technically lie, other than by omission.
[4512.88 --> 4513.16]  Not lied yet.
[4513.46 --> 4515.14]  When you described your video editing skills.
[4515.22 --> 4517.24]  However, we're about to get into camera skills.
[4518.32 --> 4518.54]  Hmm.
[4518.88 --> 4519.30]  I don't know if we need to do that.
[4519.30 --> 4525.20]  All my photo taking has been strictly for personal use and some things to post on Facebook slash Google+.
[4525.20 --> 4528.18]  I don't believe you ever posted anything on Facebook.
[4528.38 --> 4529.08]  Nope, definitely didn't.
[4529.10 --> 4529.94]  Or Google+.
[4529.94 --> 4530.58]  Did not.
[4530.58 --> 4532.82]  The cameras I have used for this, oh man.
[4532.94 --> 4533.50]  That's a lie.
[4533.70 --> 4538.74]  Are a Canon EOS Rebel T3i and some miscellaneous digital cameras.
[4538.90 --> 4539.50]  That I believe.
[4539.86 --> 4542.22]  Nope, that's honestly also not true.
[4542.22 --> 4545.02]  Your family didn't own a single miscellaneous digital camera.
[4545.92 --> 4546.96]  I don't think so.
[4547.18 --> 4547.82]  Brilliant.
[4548.62 --> 4551.84]  Linked below is some samples of my work.
[4553.66 --> 4554.68]  Let's go.
[4555.20 --> 4559.30]  The only pictures taken with the Canon were at PAX 2011.
[4559.30 --> 4563.32]  The rest were just with miscellaneous digital cameras.
[4563.54 --> 4564.30]  Thank you, Johnny.
[4564.50 --> 4566.50]  This should have been such a red flag, man.
[4566.60 --> 4567.46]  Thank you, Johnny.
[4567.50 --> 4569.90]  Why did you only have that camera at PAX?
[4570.12 --> 4570.82]  That's crazy.
[4570.96 --> 4571.28]  I don't know.
[4571.36 --> 4572.28]  Yeah, it's weird, huh?
[4572.30 --> 4572.76]  That's weird.
[4574.16 --> 4576.54]  To be fair, I think PAX was very recent.
[4577.42 --> 4578.64]  Like, when was this email?
[4579.56 --> 4581.96]  Well, based on that you're saying, I'll have a car in December.
[4582.16 --> 4583.70]  Sounds like it was right after PAX.
[4583.84 --> 4585.96]  Yeah, so maybe I just got the camera.
[4586.18 --> 4588.66]  Yeah, maybe you couldn't snap a single additional picture.
[4588.86 --> 4589.20]  Nah.
[4589.48 --> 4590.20]  Yeah, sure.
[4590.36 --> 4590.88]  That'd be nuts.
[4591.62 --> 4594.50]  You know what's really funny is these days...
[4594.50 --> 4599.34]  There's so many things that would be red flags about this if I was reading this now.
[4599.48 --> 4602.64]  These days, no offense, but when people...
[4602.64 --> 4604.46]  Oh, okay, I do actually need my thing.
[4604.76 --> 4605.06]  What?
[4605.64 --> 4608.50]  When people send me their spec list...
[4608.50 --> 4612.20]  Like, I'm just like, why?
[4612.58 --> 4613.36]  Like, what?
[4613.70 --> 4613.80]  Dude, aw.
[4614.48 --> 4616.04]  But this is hilarious.
[4616.38 --> 4622.04]  Not only did Luke send the spec list for his computer in his job application, he actually
[4622.04 --> 4626.38]  copy-pasted the descriptions from NCIX.com.
[4626.38 --> 4626.78]  Yeah.
[4627.24 --> 4628.76]  Which could be for one of two reasons.
[4629.40 --> 4631.54]  Either one, it was more convenient.
[4631.92 --> 4637.80]  Or two, he didn't own any of this stuff and was just browsing the site and copy-pasting
[4637.80 --> 4638.96]  things into a list.
[4639.24 --> 4639.74]  Yes.
[4639.74 --> 4640.86]  Which one was it, Luke?
[4640.86 --> 4643.24]  I'm looking through this right now and I'm really wondering.
[4643.84 --> 4644.20]  Um...
[4644.20 --> 4647.46]  I don't think there's any way you ever bought a Maximus Extreme.
[4649.32 --> 4650.72]  What is this computer?
[4651.62 --> 4652.48]  I don't know.
[4652.48 --> 4655.34]  Wait.
[4655.82 --> 4656.38]  No.
[4656.68 --> 4660.46]  You are talking about one you built for a customer.
[4660.70 --> 4661.38]  Okay, never mind.
[4661.38 --> 4662.86]  This was Harrison's computer.
[4663.02 --> 4664.20]  No way.
[4664.44 --> 4665.30]  A hundred percent.
[4665.46 --> 4666.52]  No way.
[4666.88 --> 4670.14]  Why did you put in two 560 Ti's in SLI?
[4670.16 --> 4670.82]  It was dumb.
[4670.82 --> 4671.30]  I don't know.
[4671.34 --> 4672.46]  I shouldn't have included this.
[4672.92 --> 4677.38]  I didn't want to even do certain things in this build, but he wanted to, like, spend more
[4677.38 --> 4677.68]  money.
[4678.92 --> 4680.14]  Oh, man.
[4681.16 --> 4681.60]  Huh.
[4682.48 --> 4686.44]  Yeah, this is not an amazing build.
[4686.56 --> 4688.84]  Yeah, because I didn't talk about the specs of my computer.
[4689.46 --> 4692.88]  Yeah, because you were more focused on the fact that it was submerged in oil.
[4693.30 --> 4693.64]  Yeah.
[4694.32 --> 4697.32]  But the specs of my computer actually made, like, a lot more sense.
[4697.68 --> 4698.40]  I see.
[4698.54 --> 4699.10]  I see.
[4699.22 --> 4699.62]  I see.
[4699.72 --> 4700.14]  I see.
[4700.34 --> 4700.60]  Yeah.
[4701.14 --> 4702.68]  What interests you about the job?
[4702.76 --> 4703.18]  This is great.
[4703.24 --> 4704.36]  Let's see how it turned out for him.
[4705.28 --> 4709.68]  Working with an industry leader in new computer hardware pretty much says it all.
[4709.72 --> 4710.72]  That's not working out anymore.
[4710.72 --> 4713.22]  Being exposed to new hardware.
[4713.48 --> 4715.22]  He likes to be exposed to hardware.
[4715.58 --> 4715.86]  Wow.
[4716.12 --> 4720.68]  And being encouraged to research and test is nothing less than a dream.
[4721.82 --> 4722.24]  Wow.
[4722.24 --> 4723.16]  To be completely honest.
[4723.16 --> 4723.60]  So cute.
[4723.76 --> 4727.40]  I have no idea if this position is paid and don't really care.
[4727.74 --> 4729.18]  At the time, that was honestly true.
[4729.28 --> 4732.90]  See, that's what established tech media was up against.
[4732.90 --> 4735.76]  Yeah, this is literally the conversation we were having.
[4736.04 --> 4736.16]  Yeah.
[4736.16 --> 4737.56]  Because, yeah, I would have done this regardless.
[4737.88 --> 4741.92]  This job would enable me to do what I already do in my free time on a much larger scale.
[4742.06 --> 4742.26]  Yep.
[4743.08 --> 4747.78]  This job would also help me contribute to the online computer hardware scene, which is always
[4747.78 --> 4748.14]  good.
[4748.66 --> 4749.56]  What a sentence.
[4749.70 --> 4750.22]  Good writing.
[4750.22 --> 4751.22]  What a sentence.
[4751.72 --> 4756.30]  It would be awesome to participate in the development of a show that I have so actively watched
[4756.30 --> 4757.64]  over the past couple of years.
[4757.68 --> 4758.76]  That was a bit of an exaggeration.
[4759.12 --> 4759.32]  Yeah.
[4759.56 --> 4760.72]  Thank you for your consideration.
[4760.96 --> 4763.66]  Any further information will be supplied promptly upon request!
[4763.98 --> 4764.76]  Exclamation point.
[4765.02 --> 4765.16]  Yeah.
[4765.16 --> 4771.42]  Feel free to contact me at any time for further questions or to set up, one word, an interview.
[4771.42 --> 4775.04]  I think I still type that as one word.
[4775.16 --> 4775.98]  Yeah, well, it isn't.
[4776.12 --> 4776.68]  I'm just being honest.
[4778.96 --> 4781.04]  Oh, the references are sick, though.
[4781.20 --> 4782.38]  Yeah, good old Johnny.
[4782.52 --> 4783.12]  Good old Johnny.
[4783.14 --> 4783.60]  Good Johnny.
[4783.72 --> 4784.22]  Johnny Chu.
[4784.66 --> 4785.22]  Heck yeah.
[4785.50 --> 4786.28]  All right.
[4786.56 --> 4788.52]  Let's give this man a Pulitzer.
[4789.26 --> 4790.36]  Thanks, Floatplane Chat.
[4790.54 --> 4791.38]  It's so good.
[4791.44 --> 4792.38]  They always got your back, Luke.
[4792.40 --> 4793.10]  So good.
[4793.78 --> 4794.86]  Don't worry, Floatplane Chat blows.
[4794.86 --> 4796.24]  You didn't want to hire me, right?
[4796.32 --> 4796.94]  Something like that?
[4797.20 --> 4797.26]  No.
[4797.26 --> 4800.58]  But then you kept talking about my resume and Yvonne was just like, just talk to him.
[4800.58 --> 4801.96]  And you were like, okay.
[4802.24 --> 4802.96]  That I don't remember.
[4803.14 --> 4803.86]  That's possible.
[4804.02 --> 4805.00]  That's the story that I've heard.
[4805.28 --> 4809.18]  Is you, if you were like, ah, like, doesn't really have, because you were mostly looking
[4809.18 --> 4810.70]  for videography.
[4810.94 --> 4812.50]  No, because I still have your hard copy.
[4813.24 --> 4814.54]  And it has an A on it.
[4814.60 --> 4816.16]  It has an A in interview on it.
[4816.44 --> 4817.04]  Oh, interesting.
[4817.22 --> 4817.32]  Okay.
[4817.32 --> 4817.52]  Yeah.
[4817.78 --> 4820.34]  Or at least I did have your hard copy at some point.
[4821.14 --> 4824.32]  The story that I'm remembering, I don't remember the exact details, but.
[4824.66 --> 4826.14]  Why did I print all the resumes?
[4826.34 --> 4828.16]  You're at the very least on the fence.
[4828.16 --> 4830.76]  You were sitting at your kitchen table talking to Yvonne about it.
[4831.24 --> 4832.52]  I think you were going through them.
[4832.98 --> 4836.42]  It might've just been easier to do that way because you were working with her collaboratively.
[4836.42 --> 4838.70]  Or maybe like NCIX printed them for me or something.
[4838.82 --> 4840.76]  I can't imagine I would have printed resumes.
[4841.18 --> 4841.42]  Anyway.
[4841.82 --> 4842.02]  Yeah.
[4842.04 --> 4843.86]  No, I had like a pile of them.
[4843.88 --> 4847.48]  I just always thought it was funny because in the early days, Yvonne and I clashed a lot.
[4848.10 --> 4848.24]  Yes.
[4848.24 --> 4850.28]  We're homies now, but in the early days we clashed a lot.
[4850.28 --> 4850.38]  Yeah.
[4850.38 --> 4852.22]  You guys made things difficult for me.
[4852.22 --> 4856.60]  She was like the one that pushed you to actually bring me in for the interview and then we
[4856.60 --> 4857.88]  just butted heads for her.
[4857.88 --> 4858.04]  Yeah.
[4858.16 --> 4864.08]  Well, it didn't help that someone, one of them was a butt head about some things that
[4864.08 --> 4869.90]  the other one takes no shit from anyone and was not into.
[4870.02 --> 4870.94]  It was a good combination.
[4872.14 --> 4872.58]  Yeah.
[4872.74 --> 4874.68]  With me in between it all.
[4876.16 --> 4877.66]  Well, it does work well that way.
[4877.80 --> 4878.18]  Yeah.
[4878.34 --> 4879.32]  Someone's got to be in between.
[4879.56 --> 4879.86]  Yeah.
[4879.86 --> 4884.22]  Oh, really?
[4887.34 --> 4888.68]  I heard that.
[4888.74 --> 4892.76]  I looked up at my monitor and Linus just slow turns and looks me dead in the eyes.
[4895.82 --> 4899.76]  Oh, you got some time until sponsors.
[4901.16 --> 4903.14]  Maybe don't go immediately to them right now.
[4904.70 --> 4907.02]  My brother's old StarCraft channel is still up.
[4907.52 --> 4907.88]  Oh, yeah.
[4908.14 --> 4908.46]  Yeah.
[4908.46 --> 4914.28]  It's been nine years since the last update and he had like a two year gap between updates
[4914.28 --> 4914.88]  before that.
[4916.96 --> 4917.44]  Oh.
[4917.96 --> 4919.34]  Hopefully he gets these ads.
[4920.04 --> 4920.32]  Yeah.
[4920.74 --> 4922.06]  I don't think so.
[4922.76 --> 4923.64]  Yeah, probably not.
[4923.86 --> 4924.64]  Yeah, probably not.
[4925.28 --> 4926.54]  Oh, let's go.
[4926.64 --> 4927.52]  He did casting, right?
[4927.76 --> 4927.98]  Yeah.
[4928.12 --> 4928.36]  Yeah.
[4928.54 --> 4929.58]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4930.40 --> 4931.84]  Good old StarCraft 1.
[4931.84 --> 4932.36]  Fire Zerg.
[4932.46 --> 4933.48]  This guy was dope.
[4933.72 --> 4934.10]  I liked this guy.
[4934.10 --> 4934.96]  StarCraft 1.
[4934.96 --> 4940.92]  And I remember both. Oh, yeah, the the West Canadian finals. I was at this, I think
[4940.92 --> 4943.08]  It was that hosted at UBC
[4943.08 --> 4946.56]  Nice, but yeah, we don't have like audio or anything, but
[4946.56 --> 4948.24]  That was a fun
[4948.24 --> 4951.24]  It was a fun era. So who's winning?
[4952.22 --> 4959.12]  Oh, gotta get that harassment going. Come on. Come on. Take out their production. Oh, no, no, you're gonna get got
[4959.12 --> 4960.24]  You're gonna get got brother
[4960.24 --> 4968.50]  You're gonna get got? Well, the one I would be cheering for in this scenario would probably be fire zerg and he's clearly playing zerg
[4968.50 --> 4969.08]  so
[4969.08 --> 4972.88]  Oh, okay. So then we want them to get got. Yeah
[4972.88 --> 4980.50]  Okay. All right. Oh, oh what just happened? He got got nice. Nice. Okay. Nice. Good job, everyone
[4980.50 --> 4984.26]  Moving on. Yeah, cold cold starcrafted. I liked that area. It was fun
[4984.26 --> 4989.84]  And then starcraft sort of died. Yeah. Hey speaking of things sort of dying
[4989.84 --> 4990.92]  Um
[4990.92 --> 4996.82]  Okay, not things dying. It doesn't matter. The point is I have um in addition to our regular topics this week
[4996.82 --> 5002.60]  I created a little section of the doc called random extra thing and then I put three things into it
[5002.60 --> 5009.40]  Uh, one was from the pre-show. We talked to we compared eight sleep stats and I don't sleep at all. Yeah, which is interesting
[5009.40 --> 5010.48]  um
[5010.48 --> 5015.24]  But the next thing I wanted to talk to you about is something you probably don't know about yet
[5015.24 --> 5020.46]  But you will probably have strong feelings about and it's the mario kart balance changes
[5020.46 --> 5022.34]  I looked it up in the pre-show
[5022.34 --> 5025.50]  Is that wild or what sandbagging is dead?
[5026.02 --> 5027.32]  I hate it
[5027.32 --> 5028.52]  I
[5028.52 --> 5029.40]  Okay
[5029.40 --> 5032.54]  Wait sandbagging is dead. I don't even know what you're talking about
[5032.54 --> 5034.54]  Like sandbagging like staying way behind
[5034.54 --> 5039.38]  Yeah, and then getting great items and using them to like rubber band to the front
[5039.38 --> 5041.54]  I didn't read that part. You didn't
[5041.54 --> 5045.20]  No, okay. Hold on. Hold on then then I want to guess I want to guess how you feel about it
[5045.20 --> 5046.92]  Okay, so they've changed it work
[5046.92 --> 5051.26]  They've changed it so that when you are in last place, you're not just gonna like
[5051.26 --> 5053.10]  automatically get a bullet bill
[5053.10 --> 5054.84]  that you can
[5054.84 --> 5056.74]  Gain some ground with and then
[5056.74 --> 5060.44]  Time it so that you can be the first one through the wickets at the end
[5060.44 --> 5065.46]  Um, I still don't like that. So I told you not to tell me so that I could guess
[5065.46 --> 5071.22]  Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Well, whatever. Okay. My my you're gonna guess my inclination
[5071.22 --> 5078.84]  Was that as a mario kart enthusiast you would consider rubber banding to be
[5078.84 --> 5084.24]  Part of the game. I do believe it's part of the game. I don't think it's uh, I don't think it's
[5084.24 --> 5089.06]  Worse with it gone. I don't think it's gonna make a huge difference because
[5089.06 --> 5095.58]  At the level I was playing it when I actually played it a lot like that wasn't a thing people did very often
[5095.58 --> 5097.50]  Uh
[5097.50 --> 5104.56]  Sandbagging people are asking deliberately underperform in a racer competition to gain an unfair advantage
[5104.56 --> 5108.52]  So an example of something like this might be in a bracketed tournament
[5108.52 --> 5110.26]  Um
[5110.26 --> 5112.76]  Seeing that if you get
[5112.76 --> 5115.94]  More points in the round robin portion
[5115.94 --> 5121.32]  That's gonna land you in a less favorable bracket where you're gonna have to play the first seed first
[5121.32 --> 5123.82]  Throwing a match or something like that
[5123.82 --> 5130.88]  Uh to try to make it farther so you at least get you know in your groove before you have to play like the first seed or something like that
[5130.88 --> 5133.98]  So that'd be an example of uh sandbagging
[5133.98 --> 5134.92]  Um
[5134.92 --> 5138.56]  If you're like, okay, I definitely can't win this tournament, but I want to land in the money
[5138.56 --> 5142.44]  And there's like a way to guarantee landing in the money something like that, whatever
[5142.44 --> 5144.86]  Um in mario kart, it's highly effective
[5144.86 --> 5147.50]  Yeah, because like if you if you know you're better
[5147.50 --> 5149.18]  than like the
[5149.18 --> 5151.36]  uh, the last four players
[5151.36 --> 5152.68]  Um
[5152.68 --> 5158.42]  And you know, you're competitive maybe with the first four but not certain you can just ride back slightly
[5158.42 --> 5161.86]  Get really good power-ups and right before the end just slam it through
[5161.86 --> 5166.44]  Uh because like the bullet bill like linus just described the bullet bill is insane
[5166.44 --> 5173.00]  Like yeah, it's kind of stupid. Yeah, and there's those lightning. There's yeah, there's multiple ones that are just kind of stupid
[5173.00 --> 5173.96]  Yeah, honest
[5173.96 --> 5182.78]  Um, even superstars can be dumb depending on the map. Yes, like having that uh that invulnerability or that's that slight edge and speed
[5183.32 --> 5188.12]  Um, the ability to drive on any terrain at full speed like some some of these things hold two at a time
[5188.76 --> 5195.48]  Um, there's certain ones where you when you combo them you they can just be ridiculously devastating also like
[5195.48 --> 5198.20]  Knowing where certain players are at
[5198.20 --> 5204.28]  Like having the lightning and then using it when someone's going over a jump will make it so they don't make it the whole way across the jump
[5204.28 --> 5209.08]  Then they fall off the map and they have to get fucking toad back on and like all this stuff. Yeah, um
[5209.08 --> 5214.94]  Yeah, it can be really brutal. It's just it's more something that I see at like a land level
[5216.60 --> 5222.26]  It's not something that I would see online as much really when I was trying to play like really hardcore
[5222.26 --> 5222.84]  so
[5222.84 --> 5229.06]  What would you prefer so so you would it's been a long time since I was doing that so I don't know so you would prefer
[5232.12 --> 5236.52]  Sandbagging be left in like the like the extreme rubber banding because I'm not I'm
[5236.52 --> 5240.60]  I don't think anyone would say there should be no rubber banding in a game like Mario Kart
[5240.60 --> 5244.60]  I think it's too much of like a family-friendly fun game. There needs to be some amount of
[5245.32 --> 5247.32]  Yeah, I there should be some
[5247.32 --> 5254.12]  I don't think it should be as extreme. Yeah, like maybe maybe only being able to have one powerful power up
[5254.92 --> 5255.48]  uh
[5255.48 --> 5262.84]  There's even an argument I could potentially make for like maybe if you if you advance in rank enough and you have
[5263.88 --> 5267.00]  a certain level of power up it like rerolls it for you or something
[5267.88 --> 5268.68]  Um
[5268.68 --> 5274.68]  Because like yeah, if you're in last place and you get a bullet bill and you like manually drive yourself up to like fourth
[5275.40 --> 5280.52]  You probably shouldn't still be holding on to that. I mean, I feel like in some of the older Mario Karts
[5280.52 --> 5282.84]  They had counters for that
[5282.84 --> 5288.52]  Like I know. Okay. I've played all of them Mario Kart 64 you lose your item whenever anyone
[5289.08 --> 5291.08]  hits a lightning
[5291.08 --> 5293.08]  I think that's right. So
[5293.40 --> 5299.64]  Like you so that strategy of like hanging play 64 much. Yeah hanging back grabbing a really good item
[5300.04 --> 5304.68]  Uh, like like okay like a super mushroom, which is really op in Mario Kart 64
[5305.16 --> 5309.16]  Because you can use it if you time it correctly you can use it
[5309.72 --> 5312.52]  Not an I forget how many times it feels infinite
[5312.84 --> 5313.72]  It's a lot
[5313.72 --> 5318.12]  And I think you might be able to just use it an infinite number of times if you use it correctly
[5318.12 --> 5321.32]  So you can go from last place to first place like um
[5322.60 --> 5328.92]  But you but you can't just hoard them because someone will probably hit a lightning bolt at some point and you will drop it
[5329.40 --> 5334.12]  People are saying this happens in Mario Kart 8 too. Oh, okay. That helps it a lot. Is lightning just less common now?
[5334.44 --> 5335.48]  Because it was pretty common
[5335.48 --> 5339.32]  I'm just gonna be on it like when I was doing that big push where I played online like crazy
[5340.04 --> 5342.04]  This was not a common issue
[5342.20 --> 5346.28]  So like I don't know. I do know that this would like whenever you'd play like on lan
[5346.28 --> 5351.24]  Like a bunch of people are just hanging out having fun like this is the thing that people would try to do to like
[5351.24 --> 5358.68]  Have fun saluna says begging it higher rate ranking in Mario kart 8 deluxe online is very common for certain tracks
[5358.68 --> 5359.40]  at least
[5359.96 --> 5361.96]  so it might be that you were
[5362.20 --> 5364.20]  leaning more toward tracks that were
[5364.76 --> 5368.20]  This is also a long time ago when when I was like
[5368.76 --> 5372.52]  So I played on mario kart 8 non-deluxe because I played on wii u
[5372.52 --> 5375.72]  And this would have been in like 2014
[5376.60 --> 5378.60]  It's been like nine years
[5378.60 --> 5380.36]  Mr. Call says
[5380.36 --> 5383.64]  Luke was in bronze where no one strategized. That's incorrect
[5386.36 --> 5391.16]  I also don't think that's how the ranking works. You see how salty you don't even know man the salt get out of here
[5391.16 --> 5393.16]  I could feel the salt here
[5394.28 --> 5395.16]  Hilarious
[5395.16 --> 5397.32]  Yeah, I used to talk to line as well. This is decent amount
[5397.32 --> 5403.32]  I knew I started getting good when all the lobbies that I would get into were just because it would show the flags of where people were from
[5403.64 --> 5405.64]  Which was really cool nerd
[5405.72 --> 5406.76]  And and all the flies
[5407.24 --> 5408.36]  Japanese flags and I'm
[5408.36 --> 5409.00]  Yes
[5410.20 --> 5412.20]  I'm making it
[5412.20 --> 5413.88]  Speaking of making it
[5413.96 --> 5420.84]  We have made a pretty stupid deal for this week. We've got a couple LTT store updates for you guys
[5421.64 --> 5425.40]  Mystery color screwdrivers are back in limited quantities. I
[5425.40 --> 5434.44]  Uh, I walked past people building them. Apparently we're doing them here. Okay. Okay. Anyway, so the other they're actually built in the 105 workshop
[5434.52 --> 5436.52]  heck, yeah
[5437.40 --> 5441.08]  Oh, these are so cute. Oh, do we do we not have them?
[5441.80 --> 5442.92]  What?
[5442.92 --> 5445.56]  That's the that's something else the post-it notes
[5446.92 --> 5449.80]  No, ah, I was not given any post-it notes
[5450.76 --> 5455.24]  Dang it. Okay. Well, I'm screen sharing now. Oh, yeah. He told us about them. These are
[5455.24 --> 5457.32]  So cute. Oh, wow
[5458.04 --> 5459.56]  Window post-it notes
[5460.36 --> 5465.96]  They're post-it notes, but they look like a little window and you can write on them just like a post-it note
[5467.80 --> 5472.84]  Isn't that adorable? I wish windows still looked that way. I mean, it sort of can if you turn on that mode
[5472.84 --> 5475.08]  It's very windows 3.1
[5475.08 --> 5476.36]  inspired
[5476.36 --> 5477.00]  um
[5478.20 --> 5480.68]  Anyway, uh, these are they're six bucks
[5481.24 --> 5483.96]  Um, the color is just the border around them by the way
[5484.28 --> 5487.24]  So they're six bucks or or these are in the bonus bin
[5487.72 --> 5491.24]  So if you buy anything else you can add a little pack
[5492.12 --> 5496.12]  At the different sizes in your order and you will get it for free
[5497.88 --> 5500.20]  Well for bonus, it's not free you placed an order
[5500.52 --> 5502.76]  Um, yeah, really excited about these
[5503.72 --> 5507.64]  All I see is 10% of the note being unusable. You must be fun at parties
[5511.64 --> 5517.48]  They are real 3m adhesive by the way we we got samples from a couple of suppliers that claimed
[5518.04 --> 5521.64]  That they used adhesive that was as good as 3m and I said
[5521.88 --> 5522.84]  right, okay
[5523.48 --> 5525.48]  Let's see them and they like
[5525.48 --> 5528.76]  immediately fell off the wall when I put them on and
[5529.32 --> 5533.80]  There was it was a whole debate internally. There was someone who was advocating for those ones and I was like
[5534.44 --> 5537.64]  Please yeah, I know they're cheaper. I fully
[5539.40 --> 5541.40]  I fully understand
[5541.64 --> 5542.92]  number
[5542.92 --> 5548.12]  Number up number down but right now the problem is not numbered up number down
[5548.20 --> 5551.40]  The problem is post-it note down how big are these post-it notes?
[5551.40 --> 5552.52]  Uh, some of them are quite big
[5552.52 --> 5556.68]  Yeah, I just saw one of the examples and it's like that's huge. Yeah, the big one is six by eight
[5557.16 --> 5558.76]  Yeah, that's that's large
[5558.76 --> 5563.32]  Uh, six by eight of what I can't remember but six by eight is something. Um, also
[5564.60 --> 5569.40]  We have oh, this is big. Um, we have an email sign up link guys
[5569.40 --> 5571.40]  We don't we don't want to spam you guys
[5571.40 --> 5576.60]  We know that you don't want to get random emails when you know, whatever stuff you don't care about

[5584.68 --> 5587.16]  Oh, wow, what is this this needs to not be cut off?
[5587.88 --> 5588.84]  um
[5588.84 --> 5591.56]  Okay, we need to uh, can okay well
[5592.44 --> 5593.96]  Nice. Okay. We we need to fix that
[5595.32 --> 5601.40]  Anyway, the point is you are signing up for a temporary newsletter not the full newsletter
[5601.40 --> 5603.16]  Which you should definitely subscribe to?
[5603.16 --> 5608.28]  Um, but you're signing up to get information about black friday and cyber monday deals

[5620.60 --> 5624.44]  You will almost certainly miss out on something that would be super cool
[5624.44 --> 5629.40]  Oh people are saying the form doesn't work for me on firefox
[5629.40 --> 5630.36]  um
[5633.48 --> 5640.68]  Define doesn't work also message support. Oh someone said that um works fine for me try disabling ad blocker
[5641.72 --> 5647.00]  That's not something that we would intentionally implement, but you never know ad blockers do all kinds of things to websites
[5647.00 --> 5650.20]  That's not something we would have intentionally implemented, but but yeah
[5650.20 --> 5652.20]  Yeah
[5652.20 --> 5654.20]  Yeah
[5654.20 --> 5654.52]  Um
[5655.64 --> 5661.72]  It doesn't verify that it adds you to a newsletter. I I know and I think that's what people might be saying when they say
[5662.36 --> 5664.04]  It doesn't work
[5664.04 --> 5666.20]  Uh labs jake. We are using
[5666.92 --> 5668.36]  3m
[5668.36 --> 5673.48]  Like stuff. I think it's fine, but um, the better person to check with with would be nick
[5674.92 --> 5678.44]  Also, there's one more thing. This is pretty crazy
[5679.16 --> 5682.12]  We are running a promo on our 3d down jacket
[5682.68 --> 5686.04]  Super nice super nice jacket perfect for the pacific northwest
[5686.60 --> 5693.96]  And one in one in 25 people who buy it over the next some period
[5694.36 --> 5697.48]  Uh, I don't see it here. So let's assume not for very long
[5698.04 --> 5702.84]  One in 25 people who buy it will get a chance to experience their jacket
[5703.40 --> 5706.36]  In the pacific northwest. Oh, that's right
[5706.36 --> 5711.24]  You could win a trip to ltd headquarters here in vancouver
[5712.12 --> 5718.52]  Because of the costs of plane tickets. This is only available to customers in north america excluding quebec
[5719.00 --> 5720.12]  but
[5720.12 --> 5722.60]  We have a special note for our live
[5722.60 --> 5727.16]  WAN show viewers not ones watching the archive because this is sort of crazy
[5727.16 --> 5731.88]  The standard chances to win which we publish um, which we adhere to
[5731.88 --> 5733.80]  um, which we adhere to are one in 25
[5734.92 --> 5737.64]  There is a one in 25 die roll
[5737.88 --> 5744.12]  If you pick up a 3d down jacket that you will be getting on a plane and coming for a tour of ltd headquarters
[5744.68 --> 5747.64]  What the heck but if you buy during the show
[5747.64 --> 5750.60]  Now we will double your odds
[5751.48 --> 5757.08]  You will have a 2 in 25 chance of winning a trip to vancouver and a tour of lmg hq
[5757.72 --> 5761.40]  Uh, the full details are oh, wow. Where are the details?
[5761.96 --> 5765.56]  Oh boy. Well, hopefully somewhere. Let me check the home page

[6023.48 --> 6030.52]  I have a post sponsors question for you before the merch messages. Okay, do you think it is a better marketing?
[6030.84 --> 6034.44]  Angle to say that your thing is ai powered or no?
[6038.04 --> 6040.92]  Because like grammarly for instance was already doing a lot of this stuff
[6042.36 --> 6043.48]  Before they
[6043.48 --> 6047.00]  I think it's used a yeah, I think it's better to say it's ai powered
[6047.00 --> 6052.60]  Yeah, I think I think that's one of the angles that a lot of these companies are for the next four months and then it'll become gauche
[6052.60 --> 6054.92]  And then nobody wants ai anymore
[6055.56 --> 6059.48]  I actually don't think so. I yeah, well, we've got this week in ai
[6059.48 --> 6063.24]  Uh, why don't we do a topic before merch messages? Let's talk about this week in ai
[6063.80 --> 6069.08]  Uh, luke's going to be finding out about all of this. Um, some of it. I heard some of it just because okay
[6069.08 --> 6070.92]  Well, do you want to walk us through it? Sure
[6071.64 --> 6079.64]  Uh, open ai held their first dev day event on monday where they announced gpt's custom versions of chat gpt that can be built
[6079.64 --> 6082.76]  Shared and sold on the gpt store
[6083.16 --> 6087.56]  These gpt's can apparently be built without coding knowledge using the gpt llm
[6087.96 --> 6091.24]  Uh, yeah, it's like you definitely don't need any um
[6091.24 --> 6094.36]  Open ai also announced gpt for turbo
[6095.00 --> 6102.52]  Which has a 128k token context window. Uh, and from what i've heard so far is just like
[6104.84 --> 6109.96]  What you should use it if you just need really fast responses that are a little bit worse
[6110.84 --> 6115.96]  Which is like, okay. Well, it allows prompts up to 300 pages long says riley
[6116.52 --> 6121.16]  That part's pretty crazy. That's wild. It used to be 2000 tokens and I thought what did this
[6121.16 --> 6126.36]  Say a hundred and ninety eight thousand that is nuts. That is you that is absolutely that that's the crazy part
[6126.84 --> 6128.84]  That that made me pause like that
[6128.84 --> 6131.16]  I've had a lot of people commenting about how it's not as good though
[6131.72 --> 6135.00]  Yeah, but the token the token like context length is everything
[6136.36 --> 6138.36]  Well, it's 40 of everything
[6139.08 --> 6140.76]  There you go. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[6140.76 --> 6145.16]  Yeah, if only you'd had more tokens to give us that additional context for what you were saying
[6145.40 --> 6148.36]  Yeah, it is crazy though. Like it's a cool development. It's just
[6148.36 --> 6150.36]  I
[6150.36 --> 6154.28]  They're all flavors like you shouldn't just automatically use it because you think it's automatically better
[6154.92 --> 6159.08]  Anyways, opening I paired these new features with an across the board price decrease
[6159.56 --> 6166.20]  And a commitment to pay the legal costs of open ai customers who get sued for copyright infringement over ai generated works
[6166.76 --> 6172.52]  Wow, that had been leaked. Can I just say that the major takeaway here for me is that we're bringing back turbo?
[6172.52 --> 6178.12]  Yeah, that's kind of cool. Yeah, like like that word turbo always like turbo like
[6178.76 --> 6183.24]  Let's get forget x, you know, yeah forget, you know, uh, you know
[6184.28 --> 6189.00]  Gtx, you know things with just like x in them for no reason that's passe. Yeah
[6189.56 --> 6194.20]  Let's bring back turbo turbo remember when computers had a turbo button. Yeah, that's sweet. Yeah, man
[6194.20 --> 6200.60]  I like turbo better than extreme, you know extreme is like stream was it's try hard. It's try turbo
[6200.60 --> 6204.52]  Yeah, turbo slow down there turbo turbo nerd
[6205.08 --> 6211.40]  Yeah, i've always liked turbo. Yeah, i've tried to keep that one alive. No one cared. It's fine. Anyways, the next one this one
[6212.12 --> 6218.84]  I've been all over I messaged linus this one humane a startup founded by former apple execs has launched
[6219.48 --> 6221.16]  the ai pin a
[6221.32 --> 6223.32]  $700 lapel pin
[6223.32 --> 6225.16]  users can
[6225.16 --> 6232.28]  Talk to a virtual assistant powered by technologies from open ai and cloud computing from microsoft the pin has a 24 a month subscription
[6232.52 --> 6236.28]  That includes unlimited data and phone calls via t-mobile
[6237.00 --> 6239.00]  it's screenless and
[6239.00 --> 6240.44]  appless
[6240.44 --> 6241.64]  sort of
[6241.64 --> 6242.52]  um
[6242.52 --> 6244.04]  We could go into that if you want
[6244.04 --> 6249.96]  Uh, but has a built-in laser projector to display text and monochrome images on the user's hand
[6249.96 --> 6253.08]  It also has a camera that can take pictures and scan
[6253.72 --> 6255.96]  To interpret objects that you hold in front of it
[6256.60 --> 6257.80]  Humane has raised
[6257.80 --> 6261.80]  241 million dollars from microsoft and
[6262.60 --> 6265.08]  Open ai ceo sam altman and
[6265.88 --> 6267.00]  others okay
[6268.52 --> 6269.00]  Can we
[6270.04 --> 6272.68]  Can we talk about this you've got to get it at this point
[6272.68 --> 6276.52]  What is it about being?
[6276.52 --> 6282.52]  Ex apple that makes you so cynical that you think people will just buy anything
[6283.56 --> 6285.08]  And create stuff like this
[6292.12 --> 6296.60]  I thought it was kind of interesting that like the the image that the laser projector puts on his hand is like
[6297.08 --> 6298.84]  Kind of blurry and not that easy to read
[6300.04 --> 6305.48]  Yeah, and they show that in the video that and you have to hold it somewhere that's not that easy to see or interact with
[6306.44 --> 6308.44]  That's not that bad
[6310.12 --> 6314.76]  You have to have it in a specific spot like that's just ridiculous. So i'm checking the time on my phone. I just
[6315.56 --> 6317.00]  It's anywhere it's like
[6317.56 --> 6323.88]  When you inevitably get this and you guys inevitably inevitably make a video about it. Yeah, you've got to do like a speed race
[6323.88 --> 6330.12]  Just like is there in different tasks is there literally anything that's faster with this thing?
[6330.36 --> 6332.76]  Yeah, because there might be maybe I don't know
[6333.56 --> 6336.68]  Okay, hold on hold on like this is just becoming a bit of a pattern here
[6337.40 --> 6344.20]  Where's that super expensive speaker that was from x apple people we we did a video about it
[6347.72 --> 6349.72]  Former apple
[6349.72 --> 6351.40]  Yeah, here it is look at this thing
[6351.40 --> 6353.16]  It sounded great
[6353.88 --> 6359.64]  But it was like wildly wildly expensive super cool design
[6361.24 --> 6362.52]  Wildly expensive
[6363.08 --> 6365.24]  Um, are these guys still around?
[6366.84 --> 6367.56]  I have no idea
[6370.76 --> 6373.16]  Holy crap these guys still exist here we go hold on
[6376.20 --> 6377.48]  100 best inventions
[6377.48 --> 6379.48]  I'm really yeah, uh
[6380.20 --> 6381.80]  Yeah, that's really how much is it?
[6382.68 --> 6382.92]  Oh
[6383.48 --> 6386.68]  There's a set of three there. How much of three of them? Oh
[6388.28 --> 6390.04]  But hey, it's a thousand dollars off luke
[6390.60 --> 6395.72]  So you can oh my you can sit on the top of this building and listen to music what a building
[6395.72 --> 6399.00]  That's what you would do. Yeah, I don't know how many like, you know
[6400.20 --> 6404.76]  Because that makes demographics you've obliterated to be able to afford that building, but it's pretty cool
[6404.76 --> 6409.24]  Like I want to make it really clear. It does sound great, but it's clear that um
[6410.44 --> 6412.92]  Things probably aren't going particularly well
[6413.48 --> 6415.72]  But yeah, it's it's 25 it's 2500 dollars
[6416.44 --> 6417.40]  It's an it's an
[6418.68 --> 6421.96]  Like I don't really know I don't really know how to deal with that, you know
[6421.96 --> 6423.96]  Um
[6426.28 --> 6427.56]  Anyway, sorry, what are we talking about?
[6428.60 --> 6431.96]  Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, okay. So this this ai this ai pin thing
[6433.16 --> 6436.12]  If it wasn't what is it seven hundred dollars
[6439.16 --> 6441.24]  Six hundred dollars or something like that 700 bucks
[6441.80 --> 6444.04]  Yeah, yes, I think because it's only available in the us
[6444.04 --> 6447.80]  How does that make 24 bucks a month subscription which comes with unlimited data?
[6447.80 --> 6451.88]  Yeah, well, that's fine. That's fine. I don't mind a 24 a month
[6451.88 --> 6454.28]  Okay, when I found out the product had a subscription
[6455.08 --> 6460.20]  I like lost it. I was like that's ridiculous. It's just a chat gpt premium subscription
[6461.00 --> 6466.12]  Plus four dollars, right? So I don't even mind that just having a data plan on something
[6466.12 --> 6469.08]  It's like yeah, okay, this is something that doesn't function without a data plan
[6469.08 --> 6471.16]  So I guess realistically I need a data plan fine
[6472.60 --> 6476.52]  I thought it was just hey, you just need a subscription to keep using your product
[6476.52 --> 6478.52]  Um
[6483.96 --> 6485.56]  Am I losing my passion here?
[6486.92 --> 6490.52]  When google glass came out, I didn't care how useless it was
[6491.24 --> 6492.20]  I wanted to try it
[6493.08 --> 6495.96]  And obviously I wasn't the kind of person I want to try this
[6495.96 --> 6497.72]  Insisted you don't want to try this at all?
[6497.72 --> 6501.08]  Hold on. Can I just can I can I pour my heart out here for a minute? Yeah
[6501.80 --> 6502.04]  Okay
[6502.04 --> 6504.44]  I wanted to try it
[6504.92 --> 6509.08]  I wasn't one of those people who insisted on continuing to use it once it became
[6509.96 --> 6515.56]  Evident that it was not useful and never going anywhere like I wasn't one of those people who was like yeah, this is like the immediate future
[6515.56 --> 6515.88]  Let's go
[6516.76 --> 6519.08]  Um, but I but I wanted to try it
[6520.52 --> 6524.92]  I look at this thing and I just see a complete and utter waste of my time
[6524.92 --> 6528.04]  I I I don't I don't want to use it
[6528.60 --> 6533.64]  I don't want to I don't even want to invest the time to learn how to use it and I feel like
[6534.60 --> 6535.00]  that's
[6535.96 --> 6536.52]  That's bad
[6536.52 --> 6543.16]  I'm gonna force myself to use it so that I can participate in all the memes about how you know dumb and it is or whatever, right?
[6543.80 --> 6545.96]  But it makes me feel like
[6545.96 --> 6549.48]  Is any amount of you open to being wrong?
[6549.48 --> 6556.52]  Well, I I have to be open to being wrong I consider that a a life skill
[6556.52 --> 6563.48]  I considered a professional skill I I recently started working on a review of a laptop like here's the thing I think
[6565.08 --> 6570.12]  I hate to bring this up, but we had a recent situation where I had made up my mind about a product
[6571.80 --> 6574.60]  To a significant degree before I ultimately
[6575.48 --> 6577.48]  made a video about it
[6577.48 --> 6578.52]  Um
[6578.60 --> 6585.40]  And I think that a lot of people interpreted that as me not being open to my my my mind being made up being wrong
[6585.40 --> 6589.48]  But that's not what I mean by made up my mind. What I mean is I have assessed it
[6590.04 --> 6591.72]  Um, i'm pretty experienced
[6592.20 --> 6597.40]  I i've seen a lot of stuff over the years and I usually have a pretty good read on it
[6597.80 --> 6599.32]  um in that case
[6600.84 --> 6607.16]  I was right about it. Um, and so yeah, the the conclusion that I had already drawn was right
[6608.12 --> 6611.48]  In the case of this more recent product in fact here i'll pull it out on the show
[6612.52 --> 6612.68]  um
[6613.72 --> 6613.96]  because
[6617.16 --> 6618.52]  This is a laptop yeah
[6618.52 --> 6621.16]  I was oh, yeah
[6621.16 --> 6624.44]  Yeah, very surprised. Yeah, okay, the first thing
[6625.32 --> 6629.00]  the first thing I thought when I saw this laptop was
[6630.12 --> 6632.12]  wow
[6632.12 --> 6637.48]  It's so thick it looks like it's from 10 years ago. Yeah, the second thing I thought when I saw this laptop was
[6638.92 --> 6640.12]  Imax enhanced
[6640.76 --> 6646.36]  Are you kidding me? Imax enhanced on a lap? What does that what does that even mean?
[6646.36 --> 6651.24]  What does that mean? So we got off on the wrong foot? Yeah, okay me in this laptop actually though
[6651.24 --> 6653.00]  What what does that mean? I have no idea?
[6653.00 --> 6656.92]  I'm not worried about that because I'm reviewing a laptop not an iMac
[6657.40 --> 6659.24]  My theater of it. Yeah, so anyways
[6660.76 --> 6661.80]  then
[6661.80 --> 6671.16]  I started using it and realized that the touchpad is extremely laggy because it always uses a bluetooth connection because it does not attach
[6672.92 --> 6674.68]  In a permanent way to the laptop
[6675.40 --> 6677.40]  Okay, slide when you use it
[6677.40 --> 6681.00]  No, a little that's good. No, though mostly
[6681.48 --> 6687.56]  um, I tried to interact with the touch screen and realized that there's a gap here because of the curved screen
[6688.28 --> 6691.96]  That makes it hard to touch the taskbar and like, you know connect a bluetooth device
[6692.68 --> 6697.56]  Okay, this is all sounding like things that I probably could have figured out ahead of time
[6698.28 --> 6700.36]  kind of drawn an approximate conclusion about
[6703.96 --> 6707.08]  And would have had reinforced by my time with the product
[6708.28 --> 6711.24]  But I know that's not true and then I rolled into a meeting. Yeah
[6713.32 --> 6715.08]  And I took off the keyboard
[6717.80 --> 6721.72]  And I opened up the gigantic foldable display
[6722.60 --> 6727.56]  Okay, hold on the pen came off. I whipped out the kickstand
[6727.56 --> 6733.48]  And I blew my own mind
[6734.12 --> 6734.68]  Yeah
[6734.68 --> 6736.12]  I
[6736.12 --> 6737.40]  love it
[6738.76 --> 6739.08]  um
[6739.08 --> 6747.64]  And so I forget what i'm actually responding feels like it's kind of stepping almost away from the laptop and it's stepping more into portable
[6747.64 --> 6748.92]  It's an aio
[6748.92 --> 6753.64]  Yeah, that I can carry with me and his battery powered. It's incredible. Yeah, um, I
[6754.36 --> 6755.64]  There's drawbacks. I
[6755.64 --> 6759.56]  I've got i'm gonna have a detailed video about it because i've actually spent a fair bit of time with it
[6759.56 --> 6761.72]  I've put away my framework and i've been daily driving this
[6761.72 --> 6767.48]  Um, and I I was daily I daily drove it because we were saying it's the aspect ratio and picture format
[6768.36 --> 6769.96]  What about it?
[6769.96 --> 6770.52]  imax
[6770.52 --> 6772.20]  Oh, all right, whatever
[6772.84 --> 6773.16]  um
[6774.04 --> 6775.96]  Yeah, i'm not i'm not getting into that
[6776.44 --> 6781.96]  Uh, the point is there's there's there's still things that are going to be gripes about it. There's problems
[6782.36 --> 6783.56]  It has some first gen
[6784.76 --> 6785.56]  Things
[6785.56 --> 6790.28]  But honestly when I saw you using it in a meeting for the first time my brain explode
[6790.28 --> 6792.76]  I I couldn't I couldn't even understand what was happening at first
[6793.24 --> 6795.48]  It's like what is this thing i've never seen this before
[6795.96 --> 6802.36]  It I love about it exactly the things that I love about a foldable phone. Yeah, it's like yeah
[6803.80 --> 6808.84]  Nice laptop. Yeah. Yeah, this sucks now like it's seeing i'm like, okay
[6810.12 --> 6816.20]  His keyboard looks honestly just easier to use it's fine. I can move it around anywhere I want. Yeah, which is why it's easier to
[6816.20 --> 6823.00]  Super convenient. You could literally lounge back and have this really light keyboard thing in your lap. Yeah, and you have this enormous screen
[6823.32 --> 6825.72]  Huge yeah, huge and it folds up
[6826.36 --> 6828.76]  Into a 13 inch form factor
[6829.24 --> 6833.08]  Which just in case you want to you could still use what you could
[6833.08 --> 6835.08]  Totally still use and I often do
[6836.12 --> 6837.32]  Or when i'm like
[6837.88 --> 6846.12]  Which settling in not great, but it's fine. It works fine. Yeah, and when i'm settled in and i'm like doing real work. It's tiny it's
[6847.16 --> 6850.76]  Huge it just transforms. Yeah, yeah, so it's um
[6851.64 --> 6856.12]  So I guess uh, what what was the point? What was I uh, what was I what was I definitely?
[6856.12 --> 6859.72]  So as cynical as you can be you're definitely still open to mind being changed
[6859.72 --> 6864.52]  Of course an example of where right yeah, that was the point of this because I had I had oh, right
[6864.52 --> 6868.28]  Right, right the original video concept was
[6869.00 --> 6870.60]  Ugh this thing
[6870.60 --> 6875.96]  How do we get views on this product? I kind of feel like we should cover it but like what's the angle for this video?
[6876.92 --> 6879.72]  And I volunteered nobody else wanted to do it
[6879.72 --> 6886.28]  I volunteered as tribute to daily drive it for a significant period of time very happy so that that would be the title
[6887.08 --> 6889.08]  so that I could be like
[6889.08 --> 6895.88]  So the title could be I daily drove this horrible laptop for a month because I thought that would be very clickable
[6895.88 --> 6900.84]  It's like your life has changed. You'll never go back and now it's like holy crap. This is actually
[6901.88 --> 6903.88]  out of computer
[6903.88 --> 6907.32]  And i'm happy you get that because I don't know i'm just yeah
[6907.88 --> 6912.44]  Um, it's careful because I don't know how many other people on the team are going to spend that much time in meetings
[6912.44 --> 6916.20]  So they might not have ran into that use. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, it's good that you did it
[6916.20 --> 6922.76]  So my my thing about the humane ai pin is yeah to me yeah, it seems like a
[6925.40 --> 6932.04]  I don't know anything about him. I could be totally wrong here. It's monochrome and honestly the lines look pretty blurry in the video
[6932.04 --> 6936.28]  Yeah, it seems like a not all that high quality laser projector
[6937.16 --> 6943.00]  A speaker that might be good or not. I don't really care. It's a small speaker. We've been doing this for decades at this point
[6943.72 --> 6944.68]  um
[6944.68 --> 6946.12]  a microphone
[6946.92 --> 6948.92]  an led light and a subscription to
[6949.64 --> 6951.32]  chat gpt
[6951.32 --> 6953.72]  Yeah, oh in some way to access the internet
[6954.76 --> 6957.48]  And it costs seven hundred dollars and is for 24 bucks now
[6959.08 --> 6963.88]  Like I just all the feature all of the features that they displayed this feels like vine
[6964.60 --> 6971.16]  It feels like something that I don't have to actually invest my own time in and I can just read someone else's summary a few
[6971.16 --> 6972.84]  years later when it fails and
[6972.84 --> 6976.36]  I can just keep doing my own thing. No, you got to try this
[6977.00 --> 6983.40]  No, I will you already you already convinced me I will I just I don't want to I guess is is the
[6984.04 --> 6988.44]  Because okay, maybe I can hype you up a little bit because I don't necessarily know if this is it either
[6988.44 --> 6989.24]  Sure, sure
[6989.24 --> 6991.00]  But this might be the first step
[6991.00 --> 6994.12]  Because we we've been talking for a long time
[6994.12 --> 6997.40]  And i'm honestly like frustrated that this hasn't happened yet
[6997.40 --> 7000.44]  Yeah, but we've been talking for a long time about the like compute puck
[7000.44 --> 7002.68]  Remember that conversation like 2013
[7004.36 --> 7010.28]  Like the wearable thing yeah, where we were like eventually you're going to have like yeah battery and compute in your pocket
[7010.28 --> 7012.84]  Yeah, yeah, and then you'll have like display and other stuff
[7012.84 --> 7016.60]  We talked about this with vr as well like building like a like a like
[7016.60 --> 7022.76]  uh, I think the concept we had after we did that one where you built a vr rig into out like a hiking backpack frame
[7023.40 --> 7029.40]  Um, we talked about doing one where we actually like strapped all the components to the person and used like
[7029.40 --> 7036.52]  uh, like ribbon cables and extensions so you could wear the vr setup including like batteries and everything
[7036.92 --> 7042.04]  In a more balanced way and just like that. Yeah, carry the compute with you
[7042.76 --> 7044.76]  I
[7045.96 --> 7052.20]  Google clips that's the one okay. It's like yeah, I I see where you're going with this how this could kind of be
[7053.56 --> 7058.76]  An evolution toward that so I don't I don't think it's the thing in my opinion, but
[7059.56 --> 7066.04]  I do think it's a group of if I can give them as much credit as I possibly could and i've dunked on this thing
[7067.24 --> 7069.72]  So like I just want to be very clear. Yeah
[7070.44 --> 7076.92]  But if I can give them any credit. Yeah, it feels like a group of people that are trying to usher in the next thing
[7077.64 --> 7077.96]  Okay
[7079.72 --> 7084.92]  I don't know if this is necessarily it but they've taken a lot of risks
[7084.92 --> 7091.32]  This is a weird product microsoft and sam altman and other investors have certainly taken a lot of risks fair enough
[7091.32 --> 7095.48]  Yeah, why can't it just be like a bluetooth thing that you pair with your phone and stick on your shoulder?
[7095.88 --> 7097.64]  Why does it have to be a self-contained item?
[7099.24 --> 7099.48]  You
[7101.32 --> 7103.32]  VC investor jail go
[7103.32 --> 7109.08]  Oh, no, you're out you're you're you're done bud. You're done. No, i'm gonna go and create my own an ai pocket
[7109.08 --> 7111.08]  Protector
[7115.72 --> 7117.72]  It could do it cheaper
[7117.72 --> 7120.68]  Pocket protector is fantastic. Okay, we'll give you
[7121.88 --> 7123.56]  220 billion dollars. Yeah
[7124.36 --> 7129.56]  A million excuse me not billions. That'll help me embezzle it even faster. Yeah, but yeah, it's interesting
[7129.56 --> 7132.28]  I i'm very surprised that um
[7133.88 --> 7139.16]  If I remember correctly, there's like there's a line in their announcement video that sounds like hyper anti-right to repair
[7140.20 --> 7147.08]  Um nice and like did you did you listen to it? Yeah, I noticed that because I liked their no one's commenting on this
[7147.08 --> 7150.12]  So they were saying no, I think it's it's it's a difficult
[7150.12 --> 7154.28]  Emotion for me to have with that because it has a mad brain
[7154.28 --> 7160.60]  It has a safety light right which yeah, because this is some of the problem with google glasses actually works if it's actually like
[7160.84 --> 7163.24]  That's gonna get bypassed immediately. Okay, so okay
[7163.24 --> 7166.28]  So here's the problem with safety lights and dan knows more about this stuff than me
[7166.28 --> 7170.84]  So he might maybe probably jump in here, but safety lights like if you have a webcam at home on your desktop
[7170.84 --> 7175.32]  Yeah, what you really want is a webcam where the led recording light is
[7176.12 --> 7178.12]  you you cannot
[7178.12 --> 7183.88]  Uh software bypass it because to be able to turn the camera on the power has to go through
[7184.52 --> 7191.08]  That led so that is your own webcam and you shouldn't be bypassable through software. It's pointing at you
[7191.64 --> 7194.12]  Right. Yeah, and you want to
[7194.76 --> 7198.44]  Make sure that you're not being spied on you own this camera and you're pointing it at other people
[7198.84 --> 7205.24]  So now there's an incentive for you to turn off the camera. So you don't you yourself so they don't know that you're recording. Oh, yeah
[7205.24 --> 7207.88]  This is absolutely right glass
[7208.52 --> 7212.04]  It's google glass and hey, which not google glass. It's all normal. Everything's okay
[7212.28 --> 7219.08]  Yeah, and then they're saying that if you try to disable the light like you just cut the front of it off and cut out the light
[7219.72 --> 7224.36]  Uh, it'll know and then it can only be repaired by them. Like it has some sort of safety trigger
[7224.36 --> 7228.12]  Yeah, and I don't know how I feel about that. Yeah
[7228.76 --> 7232.28]  I'm very mixed because one that's probably a really good feature to have
[7233.24 --> 7238.68]  But like my if they really cared yeah as lame as this might be yeah, bro, if you think
[7239.48 --> 7243.24]  This a pin i'm gonna wear is the only way I can record you
[7243.88 --> 7246.28]  You're nuts. I like that argument like
[7247.88 --> 7250.28]  That's a that's a dumb just to be like oh, yeah
[7250.28 --> 7254.60]  Yeah, so we're gonna use this argument of like we don't want people accidentally recording people which is fair
[7254.84 --> 7259.88]  Uh, but we're gonna use that argument to make it so that you just never get to repair this thing probably ever
[7259.88 --> 7264.52]  I suspect where that's where this is gonna like I like lttlabs jake paint paint works
[7265.24 --> 7265.64]  Yeah
[7265.64 --> 7275.16]  Yeah, like I don't know nail polish. There's also been like tiny little micro cameras that you can fit into like dress shirt buttons for years
[7275.16 --> 7278.12]  I think so obviously like those are very
[7278.92 --> 7285.56]  Silent this is a very overt camera that's pointing at people's faces. Yeah, I think we had a major pushback with google glass
[7285.56 --> 7291.56]  Because you're literally just like a camera in your face. Yeah, you don't know what's happening. Yeah, it makes it awkward
[7292.20 --> 7296.28]  I think we're seeing that as well. I don't know. I don't know where I am with this
[7297.96 --> 7299.96]  It's definitely
[7299.96 --> 7304.52]  Interesting in a land of devices that have not been interesting for a long time
[7304.52 --> 7306.52]  I'm into it from like a
[7308.04 --> 7310.04]  Philosophical
[7310.04 --> 7314.92]  Yeah, like I would love to just have a thing on my shoulder and that would be my thing
[7315.72 --> 7319.24]  And then maybe it connects to a screen that I reference occasionally, but I just talk to it
[7319.24 --> 7320.52]  I mean you've seen the movie her
[7320.52 --> 7325.32]  They're basically talking to their computer all the time and then oh you want to see this thing you put out your little
[7325.72 --> 7327.72]  Screen instead of the other way around
[7328.28 --> 7330.36]  So dan wants an ai girlfriend basically
[7331.32 --> 7333.32]  Well, no, I want more on his shoulder. Yeah
[7333.32 --> 7335.32]  It's like a it's like a bird
[7336.36 --> 7338.36]  Hey, yeah
[7339.00 --> 7346.28]  I i'd love i'd love a a little bird ai that sits on my shoulder. That's just like what is this google clips?
[7347.80 --> 7351.00]  Oh, wow, it's the same thing. I don't remember this at all. What is this from?
[7351.00 --> 7353.00]  Exactly
[7353.00 --> 7355.00]  This is from
[7355.08 --> 7357.08]  This is from 2018
[7357.08 --> 7358.36]  Oh, what the heck?
[7358.36 --> 7360.68]  How did this how did we didn't talk about this on wange?
[7360.68 --> 7364.52]  Yeah, yeah, we did. Oh, you just don't remember because it was f***ing stupid
[7364.52 --> 7368.36]  I feel like I have a pretty good memory for that. It's an ai camera
[7369.16 --> 7370.52]  that you wear
[7370.60 --> 7372.36]  that takes
[7372.36 --> 7374.36]  pictures when it sees something that
[7375.48 --> 7378.92]  You know might be noteworthy. Oh, I do remember this
[7378.92 --> 7379.88]  Yes
[7379.88 --> 7380.92]  So basically
[7380.92 --> 7381.40]  Wow
[7381.40 --> 7385.00]  This was in in six years five in five years
[7385.56 --> 7386.60]  We've gotten what?
[7387.40 --> 7394.92]  A 450 dollar price bump. You got a chat gpt subscription a microphone and a chat gpt subscription
[7398.36 --> 7399.96]  Why
[7399.96 --> 7403.40]  Yeah, it's literally already my phone my phone does all of this
[7403.40 --> 7403.96]  Let's go
[7403.96 --> 7405.96]  Oh
[7406.92 --> 7409.56]  Just give me a lapel pin and one airpod
[7410.20 --> 7413.56]  That is that is i'm gonna go get vc i'm quitting. I quit
[7414.36 --> 7419.56]  I'm gonna go invent to the single airpod. You can't quit. You're fired. Oh, by the way, here's a bushel of money
[7420.20 --> 7422.20]  Do it. Okay
[7422.20 --> 7424.60]  Christ silicon valley must be wild, man
[7425.96 --> 7431.08]  It's almost like I should watch like a movie that was all about like, you know how it you know happened and stuff
[7431.08 --> 7435.64]  He's so upset right now. Okay, so what's the progress on that? Have you played titanfall?
[7435.96 --> 7438.36]  I haven't played any more titanfall. No, okay. I mean
[7439.24 --> 7443.40]  You were there for all the gaming that I did in the last week. We had the we had the land last week
[7443.40 --> 7448.12]  And I was playing multiplayer games because I am a good land party citizen
[7448.12 --> 7450.92]  And I don't sit and play single-player games at a land party
[7450.92 --> 7458.12]  What I did is this are you chirping me or no, okay? That's just a statement. Okay. Oh, no, no, no
[7458.12 --> 7463.80]  If I was tripping you you'd know because I'd be talking about how ridiculous it is to go to a social
[7464.20 --> 7469.96]  Fucking land party and just sit and play counter-strike the whole time being social you can play counter-strike any time
[7470.68 --> 7475.00]  We're being so you can play counter-strike any time you can't play like, you know
[7475.00 --> 7480.84]  Halo ce or like midtown madness or also i'm again. I was playing counter-strike. You're like, hey
[7481.56 --> 7484.92]  What games you playing? Do you want to play left for dead? And I was like, yes, and you're like, okay
[7484.92 --> 7488.52]  Cool, and I was like, yeah, send me an invite and then you played left for dead without me
[7489.32 --> 7494.20]  And didn't send me an invite. No, there was a reason and I got invited by my friends to play counter-strike
[7494.36 --> 7500.52]  So I played counter-strike and I had fun and this guy never stops with the and I have friends in the land
[7500.52 --> 7505.64]  Absolute show-off you had 80 people at your house for a land over the weekend get over it
[7510.04 --> 7512.04]  Trying to think what percentage of them who's
[7513.08 --> 7515.08]  whose names I knew
[7516.44 --> 7519.64]  Not all of them were staff there were a lot of plus ones and stuff like that's
[7520.52 --> 7526.16]  Not saying I actually don't know any of the staffs names. I'm just saying we played uh, we played Pico Park. Oh
[7526.16 --> 7528.16]  Oh
[7529.76 --> 7537.28]  I didn't know I didn't know all I all I had ever seen were like little short clips. Yeah, that was very frustrating. What a
[7537.92 --> 7540.00]  brain-destroying game. He was
[7541.44 --> 7543.92]  Legitimately angry. Oh, it's not like
[7545.28 --> 7548.72]  Guys yeah, at least at one point in time guys
[7550.32 --> 7552.32]  Seriously, this is not that hard
[7552.96 --> 7554.08]  Just
[7554.24 --> 7558.00]  If it's not your turn don't go. Yeah, just like like
[7558.88 --> 7564.24]  Mad we were playing with eight people in the uh in the theater room. It was um, it was rough
[7564.24 --> 7568.00]  I gotta admit by the time luke started getting legitimately angry
[7569.20 --> 7570.24]  I uh, I I
[7571.28 --> 7577.20]  Wasn't even intentional, but I just naturally um followed an inverse function
[7577.20 --> 7582.80]  Uh, for my unhelpfulness or or my helpfulness went down inversely with his anger
[7582.80 --> 7587.20]  No, but you okay. I I I want to give you this though. You actually did fine
[7587.76 --> 7589.68]  because I know I so there's
[7591.76 --> 7594.08]  We've had that we've had this conversation before
[7594.64 --> 7596.48]  I don't I'm not gonna go too into it
[7596.48 --> 7601.68]  But it was a conversation about like the concept of trust and adult relationships and all this kind of stuff
[7602.16 --> 7606.00]  um, and I was talking about how like one form of trust is
[7607.84 --> 7609.84]  Is
[7609.84 --> 7611.60]  Kind of like just knowledge of a person
[7612.08 --> 7616.40]  So you like know what they're going to do you like trust that you know what they're going to do in different scenarios
[7616.96 --> 7617.60]  um
[7617.60 --> 7621.20]  So I like I knew where this was headed for your brain
[7622.16 --> 7625.44]  I and so i'm like he's not going to be able to just sit in here and like
[7626.64 --> 7629.04]  Keep like focus on the mission. Yeah, like I
[7629.04 --> 7633.60]  I knew that was gonna happen. So I don't know if you even noticed this but partway through one of the matches
[7633.60 --> 7637.84]  I noticed that you went away from everything dangerous and just started messing around in the background
[7638.48 --> 7642.80]  And I just went back there and was like jumping around with you. Yeah, because I was like
[7643.76 --> 7649.28]  He's playing ball. He's not messing around near the dangerous stuff. He's not screwing anyone up, but he's like
[7650.48 --> 7655.68]  Bored and frustrated and wants to mess with things, but he's doing it away from the danger and i'm like you know what good boy
[7655.68 --> 7659.52]  That's cool. I'm gonna go like support this and go hang out too
[7659.92 --> 7665.44]  And it was like kind of fun and I was like all right. This is cool. I yeah, I don't I don't think that part of your brain actually
[7666.00 --> 7667.36]  torpedoed
[7667.36 --> 7669.36]  Any of the attempts. I don't think
[7670.08 --> 7675.12]  So you know what I would have torpedoed the last level if your dad hadn't ruined it before I got a chance
[7675.44 --> 7677.60]  I feel bad that he was the last one
[7678.00 --> 7682.16]  But every single one of us screwed up at least one of them. So it was like
[7683.12 --> 7685.12]  I don't know
[7685.12 --> 7687.92]  We didn't complete the game because we spent like
[7689.04 --> 7691.04]  a long time on one half an hour
[7691.52 --> 7692.96]  20 minutes at least
[7692.96 --> 7693.76]  I don't even know
[7694.48 --> 7698.48]  on the last level where you have to get over all the do not touch buttons and
[7699.36 --> 7702.72]  There was one more leapfrog that had to happen and it like
[7703.92 --> 7706.48]  We were part of it was we were all a little low blood sugar
[7706.72 --> 7710.88]  Yeah, because the food had arrived and we were like no we're gonna complete this level before we eat
[7711.44 --> 7712.48]  um
[7712.48 --> 7715.36]  And right when we were at the exit door like we made it
[7716.00 --> 7720.32]  All we had to do was like walk through the door or something or like make like one more jump or something
[7720.32 --> 7725.52]  It was a total of three jumps and I yeah, I had I had decided already
[7726.32 --> 7728.32]  That if his dad made it
[7728.32 --> 7730.32]  You're not just gonna hit the button
[7732.32 --> 7733.36]  But I was through all
[7733.36 --> 7738.16]  You can come back out though. So like yeah, it would have worked. Yeah pico park. Yeah that game
[7739.68 --> 7743.28]  Pretty fun though. It was pretty fun until that level that level was a little much I think
[7743.28 --> 7748.16]  Um all the other ones depends who you're playing with I think if you're playing with 100% sweaty gamers, it would be no problem
[7748.32 --> 7751.28]  And if you had less potential total people
[7751.28 --> 7753.92]  No, I think even with eight sweaty gamers, it'd be fine. Yep
[7755.20 --> 7761.36]  Um, this is great. Uh, we we do have a quick question, uh from rcm 24 in float plane chat
[7761.36 --> 7763.20]  They want to know how super checks went
[7764.16 --> 7765.52]  After the WAN show last week
[7767.44 --> 7770.32]  So something happened with super checks. I don't know like
[7771.52 --> 7776.56]  So we we were playing for a while and linus was wrecking me and I had this like slow and decent progression
[7777.36 --> 7780.40]  And then I got to a point where I he leapfrogged me
[7780.40 --> 7784.48]  I leapfrogged him pretty good for a couple weeks two weeks in a row. He crushed me
[7784.48 --> 7788.88]  Yeah, like it wasn't even that close and I was like, all right, i'm like good now
[7789.76 --> 7795.04]  Linus will do well, but like i'm good now we're good and then he i don't know
[7795.92 --> 7802.16]  He spent a week, uh, you know how like in dragon ball z they'll have an episode where he just like screams the whole time
[7802.88 --> 7805.12]  I feel like he spent a week just like doing that
[7806.48 --> 7811.36]  He like repair he came in with his son and repaired the board he like
[7811.36 --> 7816.24]  That's the only thing we talked about for a week like he was just like this
[7816.24 --> 7818.64]  This is my whole life for a week and then just
[7819.20 --> 7824.00]  Crushed and ever since that week meditation and it has nothing to do with the board repair
[7824.00 --> 7828.72]  I'm, not trying to that's just i'm just saying that he was like dialed in that's all i'm saying by that comment, but
[7829.84 --> 7833.12]  I i haven't been able to get it back since and I don't think i'm playing worse
[7834.24 --> 7838.80]  I think i'm playing at the same level. I did when I crushed you those two weeks. You just went nuts
[7838.80 --> 7841.52]  I don't like i don't oh man well you know what part of it
[7842.00 --> 7848.16]  Shots are absurd like the final shot in the like in the 4v4 game that we did oh that was fun
[7848.16 --> 7855.04]  That was nuts though the last shot do you even remember it it was your your back right guy short stick
[7855.76 --> 7860.64]  Um there was like three blocks and you just bam and it landed like top corner of the net
[7860.88 --> 7862.80]  Just like you didn't even like slide up
[7862.80 --> 7867.52]  There's just one really quick shot and you were totally confident wasn't even phased like
[7869.84 --> 7872.08]  What i i don't know man
[7873.44 --> 7879.20]  It's getting to the point where people don't want to play with me it's nuts there's no chance it's like oh man
[7879.44 --> 7881.68]  I don't know luke's the only one who has beaten me
[7882.64 --> 7887.36]  That's still cool so you at least you at least get done i can usually get like a game
[7887.36 --> 7888.64]  Yeah
[7888.64 --> 7894.08]  Yeah, I can still often get a game, but we'll play like five and I only get one
[7895.04 --> 7901.28]  Yes, man, I don't know you know what it is though. You pushed me like this is the thing like I there's an
[7901.28 --> 7904.48]  There's an old expression like you can't sharpen a blade against
[7905.36 --> 7912.32]  Dirt or something I don't remember but you need you need two sharp things to make two sharp things you know what I mean and
[7912.64 --> 7914.64]  and um
[7914.80 --> 7916.80]  The reason that I like
[7917.36 --> 7924.24]  Elevated it was because you started shutting me down because I was just I was just playing intuitively before
[7924.56 --> 7927.60]  I wasn't really thinking about it. It's the kind of thing that comes really naturally to me
[7927.60 --> 7929.52]  There's this other hockey game. We played at the land
[7929.84 --> 7935.92]  Uh called uh slap shot rebound. Yeah, really fun by the way just utter chaos very great land game
[7936.08 --> 7941.60]  I would highly recommend playing with friends. I don't necessarily know if i'd recommend online play because there is some
[7941.60 --> 7944.40]  Hyper sweaty people in online play
[7945.28 --> 7948.56]  They have pretty okay matchmaking. I enjoyed online play. Yeah, okay, okay
[7949.12 --> 7950.88]  Anyway, so slap shot rebound lots of fun
[7951.84 --> 7953.52]  I don't know what it is about my brain
[7954.08 --> 7961.04]  But slap shot rebound the way you control your character. It's a like a physics based hockey game. We had played some really fun 6v6
[7961.92 --> 7965.76]  Total chaos because it's completely physics based and the way you control your character is
[7965.76 --> 7970.24]  Was I was losing the plot on those games near the end. Yeah, I know you're really mad
[7970.72 --> 7975.04]  Um, he got pretty mad at the line. You didn't have fun. I did. I actually had a great time. Okay, good
[7975.44 --> 7979.12]  um, but you you control your stick by
[7979.68 --> 7983.12]  Moving your mouse left and right and your character rotates
[7983.12 --> 7989.20]  And that translation of a linear movement to a rotational action
[7990.24 --> 7992.24]  I
[7992.24 --> 7992.80]  Can't
[7992.80 --> 7995.92]  It completely breaks my brain watching ariel from the lab
[7996.56 --> 8001.20]  from having barely touched the game to like whoa top shelf backhand
[8002.08 --> 8004.88]  Crazy shot. I can't even I can't even fathom it
[8004.88 --> 8008.80]  I have probably three or four times as many hours in the game as he does and he
[8008.80 --> 8010.80]  walks
[8011.28 --> 8016.64]  Circles around out of nowhere too because like I I the 66 games were so chaotic
[8017.04 --> 8020.08]  That he just might not have been able to flourish there at all. No, no
[8020.48 --> 8024.24]  No, he was like practicing a bit. He was playing in the practice mode after that. So what i'm saying
[8024.24 --> 8028.64]  But so we played in the 66 and he seemed fine. I remember his name
[8028.96 --> 8032.64]  He was one of the better players, but like it wasn't insane or anything
[8033.20 --> 8035.52]  And then we ended up playing. Uh, was it 3v3?
[8035.52 --> 8037.52]  Mm-hmm
[8037.52 --> 8042.32]  That was like one of the last things we did at the whole event and he crushed he was very clearly the strongest player
[8042.80 --> 8046.16]  It's just like what the yeah, it was it was madness
[8046.72 --> 8048.72]  um, and then for me
[8048.80 --> 8054.88]  I managed to degrade. Yeah in the first 66 game. I scored three goals like completely dominated the game
[8055.44 --> 8060.48]  I didn't score another goal in any of the rest of the games the entire rest of the land event. Yeah, and that was like
[8060.48 --> 8064.80]  Six or seven or eight games entire rest of the land. I never scored and scored another goal. Oh, wow
[8065.52 --> 8067.52]  Yeah, I don't know my brain broke
[8068.08 --> 8070.08]  Not in the 3v3s at all
[8070.40 --> 8072.40]  Super checks though. Oh, yeah
[8073.28 --> 8074.72]  That game off
[8074.72 --> 8077.76]  I just get it clicks. I get it
[8078.40 --> 8084.80]  and um, so I wasn't really thinking when I was winning before I was just like hee-hee fun
[8085.52 --> 8089.04]  You made me think yeah, and I was like, okay now he's terrifying
[8089.76 --> 8092.80]  Ah, man. I love it. It's such it's such a good game. It's such a good game
[8092.96 --> 8095.68]  The thing that drives me a little bit nuts is I've always been
[8096.88 --> 8099.04]  extremely defensive minded in like
[8099.92 --> 8105.92]  every game every sport everything that I do so anytime that I'm in a one-on-one scenario
[8106.64 --> 8109.84]  It takes a lot of energy to score points
[8110.56 --> 8112.08]  it comes very natural to
[8112.08 --> 8117.60]  Defend and stop points if that makes sense, but you can't just win that way
[8118.32 --> 8120.88]  Because they're probably going to get at least some amount through
[8122.00 --> 8127.04]  So you have to counter with some amount of actual scoring. So I always struggle with the scoring side
[8127.60 --> 8127.92]  um
[8128.56 --> 8133.04]  So I only had like when I when I was when I did do really well those two weeks
[8133.52 --> 8137.60]  I really only had like two or three shots that I was getting in
[8137.60 --> 8139.60]  Um
[8140.56 --> 8143.20]  But it was the defense I was shutting down a lot of your goals
[8143.68 --> 8149.12]  I would I would end a significant amount of games with like one one against and then I would have however many I got
[8149.28 --> 8150.48]  That's really frustrating
[8151.60 --> 8155.52]  But that that's what i'm normally pretty good at and then he learned how to shut down my shots
[8156.40 --> 8157.84]  all of them
[8157.84 --> 8161.52]  And also and also learned how to score more
[8162.40 --> 8165.92]  And then the sco and did that at the same time and the score just went like
[8166.64 --> 8170.72]  Just completely over two games you got like two goals, and I got 11 or something like that
[8171.44 --> 8175.60]  Like that's so rough that that's back to like the first time I ever played
[8176.24 --> 8179.76]  Like that. I don't know. That's kind of ridiculous. You'll get it back. You'll get it back
[8179.76 --> 8181.36]  Hopefully we have this thing
[8182.16 --> 8186.24]  Where any new game I will beat luke out of the gate if neither of us have touched it
[8186.88 --> 8189.20]  And then within usually about half an hour
[8189.68 --> 8195.20]  He is absolutely destroying me at it probably I think the best example of this like a pure
[8196.00 --> 8198.00]  gamer example of this is
[8200.16 --> 8202.16]  Disc jam
[8202.72 --> 8208.96]  Yeah, it's kind of like volleyball. It's like somewhere in between volleyball and disc golf. I don't even think you can play it anymore
[8208.96 --> 8210.96]  I think it's dead now. Yeah, I think it's completely dead
[8211.52 --> 8214.80]  Actually, really fun surprise it does sort of poorly balanced
[8215.28 --> 8220.64]  Which is why might maybe part of why it died or maybe I don't know there could be any number of reasons why why it died
[8220.64 --> 8225.20]  It's free to play game. I think it's still it costs money, but and you can buy it
[8226.00 --> 8228.96]  Maybe you can play single-player. I don't know anyway disc jam
[8230.64 --> 8234.32]  What makes this such a such a perfect example is that
[8235.12 --> 8237.52]  Neither of us had ever played a game anything like it
[8237.52 --> 8242.32]  I'd say about the only things we could have both had experience with is
[8242.96 --> 8246.00]  controlling a third person character model and
[8249.20 --> 8255.44]  Yeah, there's there's weird mechanics and stuff super weird mechanics with like curving the disc and lobbying it and firing it
[8256.24 --> 8258.24]  Hard and all this all this crazy stuff
[8258.80 --> 8264.80]  And so we both used a controller before and we both moved the character around on a screen. We both fundamentally understand
[8264.80 --> 8269.28]  Well, my goals on my side you need to score on it and vice versa I
[8271.92 --> 8275.44]  Annihilated him yeah out of the gate like easy money
[8276.24 --> 8278.24]  Within probably what our third game
[8278.80 --> 8280.24]  Somewhere I think you beat me
[8280.24 --> 8282.96]  I might have won one more after that and then I just never won again
[8282.96 --> 8289.76]  Yeah, and we played probably 20 games like like we played it over a couple of nights like this was and then he never wanted to play again
[8289.76 --> 8293.04]  And then the game shut down and then they did do that
[8293.12 --> 8295.36]  I so I looked it up it is still purchasable
[8295.84 --> 8301.04]  But all the recent reviews are telling people not to buy it because all of the multiplayer functionality is off
[8301.28 --> 8303.28]  They turned off the multiplayer servers
[8305.04 --> 8307.28]  They're still advertising as if they have multiplayer
[8307.68 --> 8309.84]  um and you might be able to do
[8310.56 --> 8314.96]  um like hamachi style or like vpn style networking
[8314.96 --> 8320.32]  Next land disc jam tournament. Let's go like that. So yeah, maybe it could work for like a couch co-op setting
[8321.12 --> 8321.36]  um
[8321.36 --> 8323.84]  but
[8325.12 --> 8329.44]  Yeah, but the thing is you never really cared about disc jam
[8331.36 --> 8335.36]  I thought it was really fun. I liked it. Yeah, but you didn't care about it in the way that you care about super
[8335.36 --> 8340.88]  I love super checks. Yeah, see it's a different it's a different thing. I I also would argue
[8340.88 --> 8347.20]  I I said dexterous and you didn't like that. Um, he basically called me a thief
[8347.20 --> 8352.64]  Should I say deft? He called me a thief should I say and any time there's like agility tasks?
[8353.04 --> 8354.88]  Like if you look back at channel super fun
[8355.68 --> 8357.28]  competitions
[8357.52 --> 8359.68]  Like what ones is linus gonna win versus what ones
[8360.32 --> 8362.16]  Or is luke gonna win?
[8362.16 --> 8364.32]  Like there was it was usually somewhat predictable
[8364.40 --> 8370.48]  Yeah, if it's if it's a strength challenge luke will win if it's a dexterity challenge. I will probably win. Yeah
[8370.48 --> 8374.08]  So like yeah, and it's it's a lot of like this stuff
[8374.56 --> 8376.88]  so it makes sense to me, but
[8377.68 --> 8381.30]  Doesn't mean are you so good at doesn't mean I'm just gonna roll operating a game controller
[8382.48 --> 8387.98]  See that doesn't make any sense. I think I have an opinion that it's a I
[8390.54 --> 8395.76]  Think somewhat of it is you have it built into your brain that that's how this works. I
[8395.76 --> 8400.16]  I think I think I try hard
[8402.48 --> 8404.48]  Hmm I try hard
[8405.84 --> 8407.76]  So I learned I I had a buddy
[8408.16 --> 8411.52]  Um that I grew up with that we were the opposite
[8412.80 --> 8418.64]  I would I would beat him at the beginning really okay and and I picked up that
[8418.64 --> 8425.84]  In the in the first in the first matches that we'd play against each other in he like wouldn't care at all
[8427.12 --> 8434.00]  But he would like learn different controls or all those things he'd be like trying things and then he wouldn't tell me what they were
[8435.36 --> 8439.12]  What a dick that part was like, okay, I don't know about that
[8439.68 --> 8441.68]  um
[8442.08 --> 8446.40]  And then and then yeah, he would like leapfrog me because in those first three rounds where I was trying to play
[8446.80 --> 8449.68]  He was just practicing and learning. He wasn't trying to play at all
[8450.24 --> 8453.04]  So I don't quite do that. I'm definitely trying to win
[8453.60 --> 8455.76]  No, but you are you are a methodical
[8456.16 --> 8457.52]  I'm also yes. Yeah
[8458.08 --> 8460.56]  Whereas I do think I have a bit of a tendency to just play
[8461.12 --> 8465.04]  Yeah, I don't have that kind of focus more about that winning that individual match
[8465.60 --> 8470.40]  I think you all I definitely always care about winning the individual match. That's an interesting assessment because
[8470.40 --> 8476.32]  I I think that in a game where I do have that kind of focus. I probably can compete with you
[8476.88 --> 8478.88]  I think that if you put
[8479.12 --> 8482.88]  50 hours into a supreme commander or something like that. I'd probably still beat you
[8483.44 --> 8486.24]  um, whereas depending on what it was
[8487.68 --> 8489.28]  I I think that if you put in
[8490.48 --> 8491.92]  50 minutes
[8491.92 --> 8496.72]  I would never be able to touch you again like it's just I don't know it just it just depends a lot of that
[8496.72 --> 8501.36]  That's what I was trying to say with the like yeah, we're slightly different types though. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense
[8501.36 --> 8503.04]  like yeah
[8503.04 --> 8506.00]  I don't know. It's funny because I like I can't get good at every
[8506.88 --> 8508.96]  Every rts or anything like that like I
[8509.68 --> 8512.40]  Man, I I can't handle the pace. I think you like warcraft
[8513.04 --> 8515.04]  I think you like the mass management
[8515.60 --> 8521.12]  Because you also really like anno. Yeah, yeah, um, yeah, I love it. No, supcom stuff like that. Yeah
[8521.92 --> 8522.32]  um
[8522.32 --> 8524.32]  Okay
[8525.04 --> 8528.96]  Are we supposed to be doing one show after dark like what even to come all the way back to it?
[8528.96 --> 8534.16]  We only got halfway through this article and then didn't care about ai anymore and started talking about video games
[8534.40 --> 8538.88]  You're supposed to do three merch messages after sponsors, which was four segments ago
[8538.96 --> 8544.40]  And now it's time for when after don't forget about physical games physical games. Oh, yeah
[8546.16 --> 8549.20]  Any form of gaming or competition really it's an all gaming
[8549.20 --> 8550.80]  I'm making physical games
[8551.04 --> 8552.88]  So just to finish this topic off
[8555.44 --> 8560.16]  New high-profile llms elon musk ai company xai unveiled
[8560.72 --> 8566.80]  Grok a chat gpt competitor with real-time access to all twitter posts according to musk
[8567.12 --> 8573.04]  It's based and love sarcasm and its mission is to help understand the universe
[8573.04 --> 8575.68]  Uh
[8575.68 --> 8581.12]  Xai says that despite being trained in a couple months, uh on only 33 billion parameters
[8581.28 --> 8588.00]  Grok performs better than meta's uh lama 2 and open ai's chat g uh, sorry gpt 3.5
[8588.48 --> 8591.84]  And a number of benchmarks, uh, I said that really poorly, but you know what I mean
[8591.84 --> 8593.20]  You're doing great. However, these benchmarks
[8593.76 --> 8599.36]  He's fading fast guys by people verified on twitter who get into the early access program then
[8600.00 --> 8603.68]  I'm surprised it's not in here. Um, but sam altman on twitter
[8604.72 --> 8609.76]  Um, which i'm probably not gonna be able to find on my laptop now because i'm not signed in so
[8611.52 --> 8613.36]  I suspect it's just not gonna go well
[8614.00 --> 8616.56]  But can I find it he threw so much shade
[8617.92 --> 8619.92]  Like incredible amounts of shade
[8620.96 --> 8622.96]  Oh, did he delete it?
[8622.96 --> 8625.28]  No way dude
[8626.64 --> 8628.72]  Wait, it shows that he has no tweets since
[8630.32 --> 8633.76]  Oh, is it doing that thing because i'm not signed in so it's just giving me random tweets
[8635.36 --> 8637.60]  Oh, that's so annoying
[8641.04 --> 8641.28]  Ah
[8642.48 --> 8645.60]  Anyways, he had a screenshot i'm not gonna be able to find it right now
[8645.60 --> 8649.52]  So i'm gonna quote it improperly because twitter just like doesn't work properly unless you're signed in
[8649.52 --> 8652.00]  So I don't know if I could even find this at all
[8652.56 --> 8652.88]  um
[8653.60 --> 8655.52]  But he had a tweet where
[8656.40 --> 8659.28]  He said like you know how you can make gpts now
[8660.32 --> 8663.28]  So he went through the process of making a gpt and he was like
[8663.84 --> 8666.88]  make it use like cringy shock value boomer humor
[8667.44 --> 8667.92]  um
[8671.36 --> 8674.32]  Oh my god, you got him yeah, I didn't even like me too
[8674.32 --> 8680.48]  There's a I've never seen that happen before I I can't believe I got you before you got me
[8680.48 --> 8682.88]  Oh my gosh, that's incredible
[8683.28 --> 8683.68]  Dang it
[8684.72 --> 8685.92]  Anyway, cringy boom
[8687.76 --> 8688.72]  We know what gets him now
[8688.72 --> 8692.16]  Okay, yeah, yeah, um, okay, so people found it for me anyways
[8692.48 --> 8697.28]  Um, so yeah gpts can say oh that sucks. Um gpts can save a lot of effort
[8698.08 --> 8700.08]  and then this
[8700.08 --> 8704.24]  So gpt builder says hi, i'll help you build the cheap gpt blah blah blah blah blah
[8704.80 --> 8711.44]  Sam says be a chatbot that answers questions with cringy boomer humor in a short of in a sort of awkward
[8711.76 --> 8713.76]  Shock to get laughs sort of way
[8713.76 --> 8716.56]  Is it great the chatbot is set up its name is grok
[8718.24 --> 8722.32]  And then grok and then it's some texas. I tell jokes like your dad's dad
[8723.20 --> 8729.92]  Oh, no, the the optional prompts are why did the what's the deal with how many and tell me a joke about
[8730.72 --> 8737.36]  Absolutely destroyed. Um, i've heard it's really bad. I don't know if this is real, but people are claiming that
[8737.84 --> 8738.72]  grok
[8738.72 --> 8744.64]  Hmm, um that that grok, uh, if you ask it who the best meme creator is it'll tell you elon musk
[8745.68 --> 8752.32]  Um guys, can you can you tell me if that's true because that could easily be doesn't he just steal memes like this isn't even like
[8753.28 --> 8757.92]  I don't know. I'm not even trying to throw it at him. I just I think that's like literally a thing. I have no idea
[8757.92 --> 8765.52]  Apparently, uh, apparently, uh musk replied to that. Oh, really? It was probably funny
[8766.72 --> 8769.36]  It probably had a meme. Maybe it was written by grok
[8769.36 --> 8770.00]  Me
[8770.88 --> 8776.24]  Um, I can't see it because i'm not signed in so it doesn't show me any comments so
[8778.16 --> 8780.16]  It is what it is
[8780.88 --> 8783.12]  Someone can post if they feel like it. I guess
[8783.12 --> 8791.28]  Um, in other ai news, which we are almost done amazon is reportedly investing millions into training one of the largest llms yet with two
[8791.76 --> 8800.96]  Trillion parameters code named olympus and samsung has hinted at a pivot to ai for the galaxy s24 with their own ai goss
[8801.84 --> 8803.36]  Goss. Oh, that makes sense
[8803.36 --> 8810.48]  Uh, which can supposedly translate audio and text in real time and run a significant number of ai features locally
[8810.48 --> 8815.28]  local local running that part is cool pretty cool because like
[8815.84 --> 8816.80]  mine
[8816.80 --> 8821.20]  Oh, we have ai stuff in the new phone the pixel you care about this, right?
[8821.20 --> 8822.80]  Ha ha ha it just offloads it
[8824.48 --> 8826.32]  So that's unfortunate
[8829.76 --> 8834.64]  But yeah anyways honestly out of all of that the humane ai pin
[8834.64 --> 8841.92]  Is the most interesting one do I think it's going to be a smash hit super ultra viable product?
[8843.12 --> 8846.96]  No, not personally, but we'll see i'd love to be wrong. It'd be fantastic
[8848.08 --> 8851.12]  Holy crap. We have so many more topics to talk about
[8852.56 --> 8854.56]  Oh
[8854.72 --> 8857.92]  That's how do I always look at the dog and go oh my goodness
[8857.92 --> 8862.16]  How are we going to fill two hours of show and then and then four hours later? I'm like, holy crap
[8862.16 --> 8864.64]  We've barely scratched the surface of this document too much
[8865.20 --> 8869.36]  You said you wanted to do one more talk topic and then talked about it for like an hour and a half, right?
[8869.44 --> 8872.48]  Okay, so we should probably talk about merch messages a little bit
[8873.12 --> 8874.32]  We need to do three merch
[8874.32 --> 8876.32]  we need to do three merch messages because
[8876.56 --> 8877.12]  um
[8877.12 --> 8883.36]  We need to get through some because you guys keep buying 3d down jackets because you apparently want a trip to vancouver
[8883.36 --> 8885.76]  Oh, wow, they really do and they're great jackets
[8885.76 --> 8890.72]  Yep, so we sold a few of those which is um
[8891.84 --> 8893.36]  neutral
[8893.36 --> 8898.32]  I'm not going to say it's good based on the promotion we're running, but it's neutral. I hope
[8899.44 --> 8901.92]  No, uh, ooh, hold on. I don't know
[8903.12 --> 8906.64]  I think it depends. It's something. Yeah, it's something it's jackets
[8907.60 --> 8909.60]  um
[8909.68 --> 8911.68]  Anyway, dan hit me
[8912.32 --> 8914.32]  um
[8914.32 --> 8921.36]  Hi linus. I know that you loved your pebble. Do you think that lmg will grow to a point where you'll be comfortable asking creator warehouse engineers?
[8921.60 --> 8923.60]  Design me a new one
[8923.84 --> 8927.28]  No, I think the wearable space is um pretty much
[8927.84 --> 8935.44]  Unassailable right now to anyone who's not raising gigantic vc money or or whose name isn't apple or google or similar. Yeah
[8935.44 --> 8937.44]  Yeah
[8937.44 --> 8940.40]  You're either raising gigantic vc money or you are the gigantic vc money. Yeah
[8940.88 --> 8948.00]  It's a lot of money in pocket protectors right now. Yeah. Hey, dll love the new sticky notes. How is the progress on labs?
[8948.00 --> 8952.80]  Are there any new testing stations since labs testing floatplane exclusive video? Oh, absolutely
[8952.80 --> 8956.64]  They showed me something really cool that I was annoyed that I had no idea
[8956.64 --> 8960.64]  They were working on because it'd be nice to have some idea what the crap goes on down there
[8960.64 --> 8962.64]  But I was really impressed by
[8962.64 --> 8966.24]  um, they they set up this case with all these like magnetic
[8966.48 --> 8967.44]  um
[8967.44 --> 8970.48]  Suspension points for temperature probes. There's nine of them
[8971.04 --> 8976.64]  And they set up this. Uh, we apparently created a hardware product. It's a pcb with a little
[8976.64 --> 8984.64]  Um, little spots for all the different probes and it's like a it's a logging board and it pulls uh from these um
[8985.20 --> 8987.20]  from these probes and
[8987.36 --> 8992.00]  Outputs to a pc and basically allows you to measure
[8992.88 --> 8994.88]  the impact of
[8995.44 --> 8998.96]  changing out a component on overall system temperatures
[8999.92 --> 9001.20]  in the
[9001.20 --> 9006.40]  intake exhaust gpu intake gpu exhaust cpu fan intake cpu fan exhaust
[9006.40 --> 9008.00]  blah blah blah like all these different points
[9008.56 --> 9011.20]  And it's going to be part of our approach to
[9012.08 --> 9014.08]  Like real world testing
[9014.08 --> 9016.16]  Uh for coolers moving forward
[9016.72 --> 9018.56]  super super awesome. Um
[9020.24 --> 9021.68]  So that's something but
[9023.20 --> 9027.44]  Man, I feel like labs is in this really difficult position right now where they
[9028.88 --> 9029.28]  have
[9030.88 --> 9031.92]  so much to do
[9032.56 --> 9034.48]  that it's very challenging to
[9034.48 --> 9038.40]  And it's so broad that it's very challenging for them to get anything
[9039.12 --> 9043.92]  Done and I don't mean that as a criticism of the team. I think I mean that as a criticism of
[9044.64 --> 9044.80]  the
[9044.80 --> 9045.76]  um
[9045.76 --> 9046.80]  the the direction
[9047.36 --> 9050.48]  Uh, and maybe just not even a criticism but maybe an assessment
[9051.04 --> 9054.40]  of the difficulty of the project that they're undertaking right now like
[9054.96 --> 9057.20]  You got to understand that it's um
[9057.20 --> 9058.96]  Um
[9058.96 --> 9065.04]  It's easy on the outside. I think to say oh, well, why don't you just focus just make this thing and the reality of it is that you can't
[9065.76 --> 9069.12]  Just you can't just throw more monkeys and typewriters at the same problem
[9069.60 --> 9072.64]  You can't just go. Okay. Well, okay. Let's just focus on power supplies
[9073.36 --> 9076.88]  Well, well, what are we going to do about the three-month lead time on that thing?
[9077.52 --> 9079.92]  Hiring more engineers to learn about power supplies
[9079.92 --> 9085.92]  That's not actually gonna that's not actually gonna make it go faster. So parallelization is not an invalid
[9086.56 --> 9087.36]  approach
[9087.36 --> 9088.88]  It's just that um
[9090.08 --> 9095.28]  It's really challenging to manage it's a new team. We're learning a lot. Uh, we're we're making some we're breaking some eggs
[9095.28 --> 9099.52]  We're making some omelets. Um, you know, one of one of the other big challenges is
[9100.48 --> 9101.44]  um
[9102.16 --> 9103.20]  Shoot what was I gonna say?
[9104.08 --> 9107.36]  Well, I forget because my my brain is tired, but oh, yeah, right right right right
[9107.36 --> 9112.80]  Uh, some of the categories that are really really important for us to cover like phones for example
[9113.36 --> 9114.16]  laptops, right?
[9114.88 --> 9117.44]  You can't just say okay. Well, let's just focus on laptops
[9117.52 --> 9123.04]  Let's get laptops across the line because if you want to test a laptop all of a sudden you need to test display thermals batteries
[9123.60 --> 9124.88]  um
[9124.88 --> 9130.48]  Keyboards trackpad like you kind of have to test everything so we're we're doing a little bit of everything
[9130.56 --> 9132.40]  We're learning a lot. We're building processes
[9132.40 --> 9135.68]  We're building expertise in-house and it's gonna take some time
[9135.68 --> 9138.16]  um, and it's gonna be awesome, but
[9138.72 --> 9141.84]  You know, maybe we maybe we should have just been like in complete stealth mode
[9141.84 --> 9146.56]  Maybe that would have been the right answer. I'm just not talked about it at all. I'm not i'm not sure. I mean, we've never been
[9147.36 --> 9152.24]  We've never been that closed doors, but maybe that would have been a smarter way to go about it. Either way. We're gonna keep
[9153.12 --> 9155.12]  We're gonna keep at it
[9155.12 --> 9155.68]  Yeah
[9155.68 --> 9161.20]  And I guess the last one here is also back on the ai thing
[9161.68 --> 9162.72]  Oh good
[9162.72 --> 9168.40]  Nice this question is for luke with a flurry of ai development that seems to be getting exponentially faster by the week
[9168.80 --> 9174.08]  How long could we get how long until we get an actual agi and could it be by next year?
[9174.08 --> 9177.68]  I would ask you to define what that even is
[9177.68 --> 9180.56]  Yeah, that's the new debate isn't it? Yeah, um
[9180.56 --> 9186.24]  So yeah, what is that and then I would honestly say that most people's
[9187.92 --> 9190.24]  Genuine definitions of what that is
[9191.28 --> 9196.32]  No, I I don't know when it's gonna come and I would definitely not say next year
[9197.04 --> 9201.60]  While we're still struggling with llm hallucinations. I don't think we're close to agi
[9201.60 --> 9206.16]  That's my argument. Do you want to define agi for the people who are not familiar?
[9206.96 --> 9208.80]  Artificial general intelligence. It's like
[9209.60 --> 9211.68]  When when a lot of people say ai
[9215.84 --> 9218.72]  They're using it incorrectly so people have tried to
[9220.24 --> 9223.76]  Start saying agi when they're talking about ai
[9224.56 --> 9225.84]  As a sentient yeah
[9226.08 --> 9231.36]  Yeah, one that actually thinks rather than just taking an enormous amount of input and generating an output
[9231.60 --> 9232.88]  Yeah, um
[9232.88 --> 9238.00]  Um, because like llms are like a speech predictor like an insane speech predictor
[9238.00 --> 9238.64]  um
[9238.64 --> 9245.68]  But that's an interesting way of defining it. I I yeah, sorry. I just haven't heard that before speech predictor. Yeah, kind of
[9245.68 --> 9246.96]  um, so like
[9247.68 --> 9251.12]  If you want to be able to do more stuff you want to be more general if you want to be able to
[9251.92 --> 9253.12]  You know
[9253.44 --> 9258.24]  Have a feeling maybe like maybe that's the way you're defining it. I don't know a lot of people debate on that
[9258.24 --> 9260.24]  Uh, I think we're pretty far from that
[9261.44 --> 9261.92]  All right
[9264.80 --> 9266.40]  I want to talk about the olid steam deck
[9267.28 --> 9269.36]  You've been tuned out but have you seen anything about it?
[9270.72 --> 9270.96]  um
[9272.16 --> 9272.40]  No
[9272.40 --> 9274.40]  No
[9274.40 --> 9276.40]  It is incredible
[9278.72 --> 9280.72]  Are you ready to buy a steam deck sir?
[9280.72 --> 9281.68]  Is that the only change?
[9282.48 --> 9282.72]  No
[9282.72 --> 9283.68]  Okay
[9283.68 --> 9284.80]  Tell me about it
[9284.80 --> 9289.20]  So that's the one that valve is talking about okay, so first of all, it's not just an oled display
[9289.44 --> 9291.44]  It is an hdr oled display. Oh
[9291.44 --> 9293.28]  One thousand nits peak brightness. Oh
[9293.60 --> 9295.12]  valve did a ton of work
[9295.12 --> 9297.76]  Wow on linux to make this color
[9298.16 --> 9300.64]  pipeline work not just work, but they're
[9302.24 --> 9307.44]  They're extremely proud of the way that you can just launch an hdr game and it'll just be an hdr
[9308.48 --> 9309.44]  very very
[9310.24 --> 9312.80]  Incredible really like it's it's outstanding. Um
[9313.60 --> 9314.80]  It's bigger
[9314.80 --> 9316.72]  It's 7.4 instead of seven inches
[9317.36 --> 9321.20]  So that's without changing the body. It just has a slightly slimmer
[9322.08 --> 9324.00]  Bezel frame a slightly bigger screen
[9324.64 --> 9328.96]  Oh, so it is not bigger. Just the screen's just the screen's bigger cool. The um
[9332.48 --> 9334.08]  The refresh rate is now 90 hertz
[9335.76 --> 9342.64]  That's actually enormous like freaking awesome. Yeah, like obviously 30 to 60
[9342.80 --> 9343.36]  Is like?
[9344.40 --> 9349.52]  The one that like matters going from 60 to 90 is still huge. Yep
[9350.32 --> 9350.64]  um
[9351.44 --> 9354.72]  Let me try and think man. This thing is just kind of freaking awesome. Um
[9355.60 --> 9356.80]  They didn't increase the price
[9358.32 --> 9362.72]  The price is the same at the three tiers except the middle tier went up 20 bucks
[9363.36 --> 9369.52]  But the storage is way higher so they don't even have that 64 gig option anymore with like emmc or whatever
[9369.52 --> 9371.68]  It's all real ssds across the board
[9372.48 --> 9373.28]  um
[9373.28 --> 9380.88]  They slightly revised a couple of things like the the buttons for the shoulders are on the same pcb as the joystick buttons now
[9380.88 --> 9384.24]  So the parts aren't interchangeable, uh, they changed the cooler though
[9384.40 --> 9385.92]  The cooler is more efficient quieter
[9386.48 --> 9389.28]  Um, the big oh, oh, yeah, the battery life is up
[9389.84 --> 9391.44]  We measured about 45 percent
[9392.24 --> 9394.48]  But they claim anywhere from 30 to 50 percent
[9395.44 --> 9399.20]  So it's a bigger battery and get this new silicon
[9401.12 --> 9403.20]  They went from seven nanometer to six nanometer
[9403.68 --> 9406.96]  It's just a die shrink so the performance target is the same
[9407.68 --> 9413.84]  But it does perform better. Yeah, okay because it just like turbo is a bit higher and is and that's part of where that that battery life gain
[9414.40 --> 9418.64]  Uh comes from it has a new wi-fi chip that downloads games three times faster. That's what they said
[9418.64 --> 9423.92]  We validated that so they'll download games that up to 650 megabit per second on a wi-fi 60 network
[9425.04 --> 9426.24]  it's
[9426.72 --> 9428.72]  Kind of freaking awesome
[9428.72 --> 9430.72]  Oh, oh, where'd that go?
[9430.72 --> 9433.04]  Why is there a limited edition? What does that even mean?
[9433.04 --> 9436.48]  Yeah, it's just a colorway. Don't worry about it. Oh, uh, this is uh, oh
[9437.28 --> 9440.56]  Brandon from the lab sent me this, uh, this cool capture
[9440.56 --> 9442.80]  We did some pursuit camera stuff showing the
[9443.44 --> 9448.00]  Increasing clarity on the oled display never mind the increase in refresh rate and it is
[9448.96 --> 9450.16]  amazing
[9450.16 --> 9457.28]  Compared to the original one. I said we should add it to the wanshow doc for like a wasn't a video segment, but um,
[9457.44 --> 9460.00]  I don't know. Maybe it got lost somewhere along the line, but
[9460.96 --> 9462.96]  the display is
[9463.28 --> 9468.24]  Flippin cool. They apparently revised the haptics and speakers and a couple of other things a bit
[9468.24 --> 9470.08]  We didn't notice as big of a difference with that though
[9470.08 --> 9473.36]  The big one was the display the improved performance and the improved battery life
[9474.24 --> 9477.52]  And the fact that they now have more storage without increasing the price
[9478.64 --> 9480.64]  I think it it was already
[9481.28 --> 9485.44]  A great value and an awesome device. I think now it is
[9485.92 --> 9488.72]  I would hesitate to call anything perfect. It's not perfect
[9489.12 --> 9493.04]  Uh, you know, it's not going to run games that don't work outside of windows
[9493.04 --> 9498.88]  It's um, it's still big. It's bulky, right? Like, uh, not everyone's into that gigantic form factor
[9498.88 --> 9502.64]  It's one of the reasons that I daily drive an ally instead of the original steam deck
[9504.32 --> 9506.80]  Um, but I would say it is definitive
[9506.80 --> 9509.44]  It is right it addresses
[9509.44 --> 9515.52]  It addresses every problem that I had with the original steam deck that can be addressed
[9516.08 --> 9519.04]  Um, other than just you know more performance
[9519.04 --> 9520.88]  A generational improvement on whatever
[9520.88 --> 9522.08]  Exactly. Yeah, yeah
[9522.08 --> 9523.52]  Are you ready to get one?
[9523.52 --> 9524.72]  I don't know
[9524.72 --> 9527.84]  I have a lot of like
[9527.84 --> 9530.48]  So you'd rather get an AI lapel pin?
[9530.48 --> 9532.48]  No, I want you to get that
[9532.48 --> 9532.88]  Ah
[9532.88 --> 9533.68]  Yeah
[9533.68 --> 9534.88]  Wow
[9534.88 --> 9535.68]  I don't want one
[9535.68 --> 9538.48]  Ridiculous
[9538.48 --> 9546.64]  I don't want one of those dude, come on
[9547.84 --> 9550.40]  I, it's, it's definitely interesting
[9550.40 --> 9551.68]  It looks really cool
[9551.68 --> 9553.36]  I do think you're
[9553.36 --> 9556.40]  The 90 hertz thing is honestly the biggest win for me
[9556.40 --> 9559.92]  I care a lot more about that than it being HDR or whatever else
[9559.92 --> 9561.04]  I think that stuff is cool
[9561.04 --> 9562.48]  Oh, the display looks so good though
[9562.48 --> 9563.20]  I mean, okay
[9563.20 --> 9565.04]  I'm sure that's valuable and good
[9565.04 --> 9567.52]  You've seen the switch OLED next to the regular switch, right?
[9569.04 --> 9570.08]  Uh, actually no
[9570.08 --> 9571.12]  Oh, okay
[9571.12 --> 9572.16]  All right, never mind
[9572.16 --> 9576.24]  I suspect it is the same display as the switch OLED
[9576.24 --> 9578.48]  And Nintendo just doesn't have an HDR pipeline
[9578.48 --> 9580.48]  That is my suspicion
[9580.48 --> 9583.92]  Uh, based on the similarity of the subpixel layout
[9583.92 --> 9586.88]  Um, based on the similarity of the pixel density
[9586.88 --> 9588.96]  It may not be the same same
[9588.96 --> 9591.84]  It may not actually come from the same mother glass
[9591.84 --> 9593.12]  But it also might
[9594.64 --> 9595.68]  They're very similar
[9595.68 --> 9598.00]  I, my, my only thing is
[9598.48 --> 9600.08]  Uh
[9602.56 --> 9605.44]  Yeah, I have a lot of potential pending expenses
[9605.44 --> 9607.36]  So I'm not really in a spendy mode
[9608.32 --> 9609.28]  All right, that's fair enough
[9609.28 --> 9610.80]  But this does sound great
[9611.84 --> 9613.68]  And maybe we'll see how I feel
[9615.04 --> 9616.48]  Closer to actual launch
[9616.48 --> 9617.28]  When is actual launch?
[9618.56 --> 9619.76]  The 17th or something
[9619.76 --> 9621.12]  Yeah, it's like a week
[9621.12 --> 9621.68]  It's the 16th
[9621.68 --> 9621.84]  Yeah
[9621.84 --> 9623.04]  Wow
[9623.04 --> 9625.28]  Wow, wow, wow
[9625.28 --> 9628.32]  I wonder how fast this one's gonna sell out
[9628.32 --> 9630.16]  Do you think they're gonna backlog immediately again?
[9630.16 --> 9630.88]  Oh yeah
[9630.88 --> 9631.04]  Yeah
[9631.04 --> 9631.68]  100%
[9631.68 --> 9632.32]  Yeah
[9632.32 --> 9632.64]  Yeah
[9632.64 --> 9632.96]  Yeah
[9632.96 --> 9634.32]  I, I hate to give people ideas
[9634.32 --> 9636.00]  But realistically they already had the idea
[9636.00 --> 9637.76]  So it's not like I'm changing anything
[9637.76 --> 9640.56]  But uh, if I was a scalper I'd be all over this one
[9640.56 --> 9640.72]  Yeah
[9640.72 --> 9642.08]  Yeah, I think this is gonna be
[9642.08 --> 9644.32]  I think this is gonna be backlogged for months again
[9644.32 --> 9646.00]  But then again, you know, I don't know
[9646.00 --> 9648.64]  Maybe a big part of the reason the original deck was backlogged
[9648.64 --> 9651.84]  Was not because of the volume of orders
[9651.84 --> 9656.64]  But rather because of the capacity that Valve had for manufacturing them
[9656.64 --> 9659.44]  Maybe that capacity is way higher
[9659.44 --> 9661.68]  Maybe they've been stockpiling these things for the last month
[9661.68 --> 9662.56]  I don't know
[9662.56 --> 9662.72]  Um
[9663.44 --> 9665.04]  Yeah, they might see it coming this time
[9665.04 --> 9665.76]  Maybe
[9665.76 --> 9666.40]  Maybe
[9666.40 --> 9666.72]  Don't know
[9668.24 --> 9669.12]  This is interesting
[9670.16 --> 9675.76]  Um, remember that Calios thing that we talked about during the Computex WAN show
[9675.76 --> 9677.84]  Where I said I refused to cover their product
[9677.84 --> 9678.24]  Yes
[9678.24 --> 9684.40]  Because they refused to refund the backers who originally funded their project on Kickstarter
[9684.40 --> 9684.88]  Yeah
[9684.88 --> 9688.24]  Even though they were still a functioning company and
[9689.12 --> 9694.40]  They were releasing this new product that was a spiritual successor and then just offering people like a voucher to buy the new one
[9694.40 --> 9697.12]  Which was twice as expensive and I thought the whole thing was really stupid
[9697.76 --> 9700.24]  Uh, this is reported by fanless tech and tom's hardware
[9700.64 --> 9705.36]  But seven years after the failed kickstarter campaign a source for fanless tech
[9705.36 --> 9711.92]  says that original backers of the nsg s0 fanless chassis are finally
[9711.92 --> 9716.72]  being offered a refund around 500 or alternatively
[9716.72 --> 9721.92]  They can choose a voucher for the street com sg 10 fanless gaming case reportedly worth
[9722.64 --> 9723.28]  $1,000
[9723.28 --> 9724.72]  um
[9724.72 --> 9733.28]  Despite this reporting however, their kickstarter page has not been updated
[9733.28 --> 9734.08]  So
[9734.08 --> 9734.48]  Uh
[9734.48 --> 9735.04]  Uh
[9735.04 --> 9737.44]  So hold on hold on
[9737.44 --> 9738.96]  Uh, so where's the
[9739.60 --> 9740.56]  So where's the
[9740.56 --> 9741.12]  Uh
[9741.12 --> 9746.40]  Basically the reason i'm bringing this up is because I want to know is this actually happening?
[9746.72 --> 9748.24]  Did anybody back this thing?
[9749.76 --> 9754.56]  Once you get a voucher I want to hear from you because I really want to cover this new case
[9754.96 --> 9759.20]  And so I want to know when it's time to reach out to them and do a video about it
[9759.20 --> 9764.32]  And I can't do that because I said I wouldn't until and because I just don't think it's the right thing to do
[9764.32 --> 9768.32]  Which is why I said I wouldn't but anyway, uh, i'm i'm not able to do that until they
[9768.72 --> 9773.20]  Refund or offer a refund the voucher is fine as long as there is also
[9773.60 --> 9779.60]  An option for a refund until they refund everyone who backs this thing. So, um, so please, uh, let us know get in touch
[9779.60 --> 9780.64]  um, I don't know
[9782.64 --> 9784.64]  What's the best way to get in touch with me these days?
[9785.28 --> 9790.48]  Contact us through our public emails and just say like hey, I asked for I asked for people who back to this thing to
[9790.56 --> 9793.04]  Let us know if they if they get a refund that would be good
[9794.64 --> 9796.32]  Uh, all right
[9796.32 --> 9802.24]  Uh, oh man, you know how i've rented about chamberlain group they make garage door openers
[9803.36 --> 9808.40]  Yeah, I think and I was like hyper insistent on not getting a chamberlain garage door opener at my new house
[9809.04 --> 9814.40]  And super angry about the way that they uh, they got rid of if this then that integration
[9814.72 --> 9822.32]  Or something like that and that was that was why initially I started having probably oh, no, that was it if this then that changed their api access thing
[9822.32 --> 9823.28]  Okay, no, no, no, okay
[9823.28 --> 9828.64]  So chamberlain the thing that really bothered me about them was they wanted to charge for api access
[9829.20 --> 9832.32]  Uh, like you had to pay a subscription fee for your garage door opener
[9832.32 --> 9839.52]  To use it with things that needed api access and their justification was that they needed to pay the developers to maintain the api and
[9839.92 --> 9843.04]  I have said no, uh, we you that's how that's you
[9843.28 --> 9848.16]  You pay for those out of selling garage door openers like we need to be able to access the thing. That's ridiculous
[9848.24 --> 9851.04]  So you have to use you had to use
[9852.32 --> 9858.40]  Their integration with I forget if it was home assistant or alexa or something and honestly the thing that bothered me most and this
[9858.40 --> 9861.92]  This is so stupid, but instead of just saying open my garage door
[9862.80 --> 9864.56]  You had to use their integration. It was
[9865.20 --> 9869.60]  Uh, hey google. Sorry. Oh shoot. I shouldn't have done that. Sorry. Hey g word
[9870.08 --> 9872.08]  um
[9872.08 --> 9872.48]  ah
[9873.76 --> 9875.36]  Tell chamber
[9875.36 --> 9877.12]  oh stop
[9877.12 --> 9884.96]  Tell chamberlain my queue to open garage door identity, whatever like you had to do this long convoluted string when it should be as simple as
[9885.60 --> 9888.08]  Open left door open right door open both doors
[9888.56 --> 9892.24]  I i'm no i'm not allow me to set my I couldn't set my own
[9893.12 --> 9895.36]  Triggers which triggered me
[9896.00 --> 9901.36]  So that was why I put a bunch of work and there's multiple videos about this into bypassing their nonsense
[9901.36 --> 9904.40]  So that I can just create my own automations that I can
[9904.88 --> 9907.04]  Uh, that I can activate in any way that I want
[9907.60 --> 9911.84]  So anyway long story short these guys are being even on mother's day
[9911.84 --> 9913.92]  Or father's day or something
[9914.64 --> 9920.48]  You should you should just if if when show lands on one of those days. Oh, you should just drop a like
[9922.24 --> 9922.40]  Hey
[9924.40 --> 9927.44]  Call mom or call dad. That'd be hilarious. I love it
[9928.96 --> 9929.36]  um
[9930.48 --> 9932.88]  Oh, man, I apparently did trigger some things
[9933.44 --> 9934.32]  Uh, my bad
[9934.32 --> 9939.92]  Which I which i'm surprised because like mine didn't go off because mine has voice detection. Is that just a pixel thing?
[9939.92 --> 9946.24]  Uh, because like my they're all supposed to as well. Yeah, they're all supposed to mine never goes off when anyone does
[9946.24 --> 9948.96]  Yeah, no, they're they're all but maybe your voice is just really distinctive
[9949.28 --> 9952.64]  Maybe so it could be that other people have a voice that sounds kind of like mine. Sorry to hear that
[9953.20 --> 9956.96]  Um, anyway, chamberlain is back to being buttheads over the last few months
[9957.52 --> 9958.32]  um
[9958.32 --> 9962.00]  They have repeatedly blocked access to their devices by
[9962.56 --> 9966.00]  Unauthorized third-party platforms used to manage smart homes
[9966.64 --> 9967.12]  however
[9968.00 --> 9970.96]  My queue which is their stupid thing
[9971.68 --> 9978.48]  Has very few authorized partners because they require them to pay for the right to interact with their devices
[9979.28 --> 9983.36]  Chamberlain appears to be trying to push customers to use the official my queue app which
[9984.08 --> 9985.12]  sucks
[9985.12 --> 9985.92]  um
[9985.92 --> 9991.04]  Okay, and again, this is really shallow it actually like works fine, but when you want to close the garage door
[9991.76 --> 9996.88]  It like flashes the light and beeps for like 10 seconds before it starts to move and I don't have time for that
[9997.76 --> 10003.36]  It's annoying. I'm leaving my house. I can clearly see that there's nothing in the way. Also. There's the beam
[10003.92 --> 10008.72]  Also, if it touches something it goes back up. How many safety features do we need?
[10009.20 --> 10016.48]  To ensure that nobody is trapped under it. Yeah, it's fine. The beam is like close the door pretty good
[10016.48 --> 10022.64]  Yeah, it's fine. Also touch detection. It's fine. Those two things combined. It they're fine. It's a lot
[10022.80 --> 10026.40]  Yeah, anyway, so that that honestly that's one of the big reasons
[10026.40 --> 10031.36]  I don't like using their app because I just want my door to close. I said close the door. Don't wait close the door
[10031.76 --> 10033.12]  uh, anywho
[10033.12 --> 10036.80]  Um, so yeah, they want to push people to use the official app the app. Oh wow
[10036.80 --> 10043.12]  Apparently added large persistent ads that occasionally push the open garage button off the screen
[10044.16 --> 10045.68]  Recently, uh, okay
[10045.68 --> 10046.72]  Anyway, that's amazing
[10046.72 --> 10054.16]  So the thing that made this catch my attention was that home assistant announced they will be removing their my cue smart device integration
[10054.48 --> 10061.04]  Which has been working only sporadically because as an open source project paying my cues fee is unsustainable and goes against their values as a company
[10061.04 --> 10065.92]  This is the quote my cue users should be able to access the devices they paid for and the data
[10065.92 --> 10070.00]  They own in any way they want without a third party having to pay an additional fee
[10070.56 --> 10079.12]  Now this is the reason this matters in addition to my cue chamberlain owns several conventional garage door opener brands such as liftmaster
[10079.68 --> 10086.32]  Raynor craftsman and clicker so in north america this might this might not be a problem outside but in north america
[10086.80 --> 10088.80]  they have
[10088.80 --> 10089.84]  colossal
[10089.84 --> 10091.04]  market share
[10091.04 --> 10093.68]  so I just wanted to flag this for you guys they are
[10094.16 --> 10095.04]  holes
[10095.04 --> 10095.84]  and
[10095.84 --> 10100.56]  You or anyone you know should not buy anything from them because they take an extremely
[10100.56 --> 10105.36]  Anti-consumer approach to basically everything they do as far as I can tell that's all I have to say about that
[10106.16 --> 10108.72]  Yeah, uh, do you want to talk about the
[10109.52 --> 10111.84]  board ape yacht club party or should we just kind of
[10112.80 --> 10118.00]  Gloss over we can honestly gloss over it. Yeah, some people were exposed to uv lights
[10118.00 --> 10122.48]  That were like disinfectant uv lights instead of regular black lights
[10122.48 --> 10127.12]  Yeah, um, and some had their vision affected which is a real bummer
[10127.68 --> 10129.12]  um, sorry to hear that
[10129.12 --> 10132.80]  Yep, speaking of uv lights
[10132.80 --> 10140.08]  I was looking into them for the land center and you can get like industrial grade like super narrow wavelength
[10140.64 --> 10141.68]  but not
[10141.68 --> 10145.04]  Like deep enough to be a problem and I was thinking it'd be cool to have like
[10146.16 --> 10149.92]  It could be double purpose, right? So you could just have black lights at your land parties
[10150.72 --> 10156.56]  Or you could do uv like like, like, um, like like like disco disco bowling like disco badminton
[10158.24 --> 10161.76]  We get shuttles like plastic shuttles that are uv reactive
[10162.32 --> 10165.36]  Like try to play like that. Oh my god. That'd actually be kind of sick
[10165.60 --> 10169.60]  That'd actually be kind of cool. AJ and I were talking about doing a full dmx setup
[10170.24 --> 10170.48]  So
[10171.36 --> 10176.72]  We can go for full crazy lights you got lasers. Nobody has approved budget for a full dmx setup there
[10176.72 --> 10182.80]  Well, that's the news to me. We've already ordered all of it. No, we haven't no, we're just talking about it
[10183.20 --> 10184.88]  Might be something that I was wanting
[10185.44 --> 10190.88]  Yeah, it was just brain leg. I wanted to convince you that we did order it, but wow
[10191.44 --> 10195.28]  You had already said that was really slow. You can't get you can't get anything past linus
[10195.76 --> 10197.76]  not right now
[10199.84 --> 10202.88]  You also know i've like talked to him about I have to show him the budget sheet
[10202.88 --> 10205.84]  He knows he hasn't seen it the infrastructure's there if you want it
[10206.72 --> 10208.72]  Yeah
[10208.88 --> 10213.92]  Uh, we asked the community for to show us some 3d printing projects that they're working on right now
[10214.32 --> 10216.32]  Uh, here's a few highlights
[10216.40 --> 10221.20]  James is working on these cute little 3d printed toy parrots for a toy drive. Oh
[10221.68 --> 10225.20]  Here's a replacement refrigerator door handle. Um, definitely
[10226.00 --> 10230.56]  Function over form a keyboard because ergo keyboards are too expensive
[10231.36 --> 10234.80]  Yeah, this is super cool custom front panel for a case
[10234.80 --> 10235.76]  Nice
[10235.76 --> 10236.96]  Love it. These are all sick
[10236.96 --> 10239.12]  gpu holder created with solid works
[10240.00 --> 10246.16]  Uh body for a drift car an rc drift that honestly makes sense and you probably go through them
[10246.16 --> 10252.80]  So make it your own cinema style housings for a bunch of vintage lenses. That's pretty cool. Whoa and a lot of guns
[10253.36 --> 10256.48]  Apparently two-thirds of the responses were guns of some sort. So
[10256.48 --> 10258.48]  There's something
[10261.60 --> 10264.40]  I think that's it for our
[10265.52 --> 10268.96]  Scheduled programming. I think it's time to go to wan show after dark
[10269.84 --> 10270.08]  Yeah
[10271.68 --> 10272.16]  Hey, dan
[10272.16 --> 10275.60]  He's on it. He's on it. I'll figure it out
[10276.96 --> 10281.44]  Oh, yeah. Oh, uh, oh wait, that's it. That's all you changed. You just put that there?
[10281.44 --> 10282.88]  I just put that there. Wow. Good job
[10282.88 --> 10290.08]  All right, we got some merch messages to go through here
[10291.20 --> 10297.60]  People are very into um potentially winning trips here. Maybe our odds of winning were too good. I think so
[10297.60 --> 10304.64]  I wonder if we had to go quite that aggressive on it. I don't think so. Did you do a standard deviation model? No. Oh, no, I just
[10305.20 --> 10308.56]  Just yellowed it. It's 25. I wung it. Um
[10309.92 --> 10311.92]  It seemed cool
[10311.92 --> 10313.92]  It's good business sense right there
[10314.56 --> 10319.36]  Yeah, is it more cost effective to just buy 25 jackets?
[10320.72 --> 10321.76]  No, no
[10322.48 --> 10327.04]  All right, you do well in vegas. Yeah, well, okay. I wouldn't go to vegas
[10327.60 --> 10331.76]  Mutually exclusive sir. Can I just bet on red and black at the same time?
[10332.72 --> 10334.72]  Then I win no matter what
[10337.04 --> 10340.24]  I know he's kidding, but there's a green so you you could still lose
[10341.20 --> 10342.24]  Never 100%
[10342.24 --> 10346.80]  There didn't used to be really. Yeah, they added green because you oh wow. Yeah. Yeah
[10347.44 --> 10351.52]  Old roulette was 50 50 and now it's like 49 and a half or whatever. Yeah
[10352.16 --> 10357.28]  Terrible. Yeah, that's rude. Okay. First one here saving up for those black friday sales
[10357.28 --> 10357.92]  Let's go
[10357.92 --> 10362.40]  Will they just be discounts or any shipping offers do you reckon?
[10364.00 --> 10366.08]  My lips are sealed all I know is that
[10366.96 --> 10368.08]  Nick and linus are fighting
[10369.92 --> 10376.24]  He was uh, he was very angry earlier. So yeah, nick still wants there to like be things to sell and linus is like burn it all
[10376.80 --> 10378.00]  um burn it all
[10378.72 --> 10383.12]  Look not with fire, but with sales. Yeah, we we um
[10383.12 --> 10389.36]  I want to create a splash
[10391.04 --> 10395.52]  I want our black friday didn't like my fire analogies countering with water splash
[10395.52 --> 10398.88]  Yes, I want our I want our it's a pokemon battle um
[10399.68 --> 10400.00]  You know
[10401.12 --> 10406.00]  I want us to look at our inventory and go you know your ass is grass
[10408.00 --> 10413.76]  Trying to work my way through all the elements yeah, yeah, that's the last one we're gonna blow them all away
[10413.76 --> 10415.76]  I
[10417.28 --> 10419.28]  Just hit my head
[10419.92 --> 10425.60]  I think my head our prices will hit rock bottom. That's pretty good actually. Oh, that's that's better than the grass thing
[10426.56 --> 10430.00]  Or are we trying to do all the oh goodness gracious? Are we trying to do all the pokemon?
[10430.00 --> 10432.00]  You said grass so I thought yeah, okay
[10432.00 --> 10434.00]  Well, you did blow you could never
[10434.32 --> 10436.00]  predict these deals
[10436.64 --> 10439.44]  Got psychic type. That's a tough one. That's pretty good
[10439.44 --> 10446.64]  Oh, man, you got to get them before they disappear there's ghost type. Mmm. Yeah, not not bad
[10446.64 --> 10453.44]  That's good. Not bad. That's good. Not bad. That's good prices are so they're so great. They'll poison me
[10454.40 --> 10459.44]  They're toxic to me. They're really dragging down linus's bottom line
[10461.68 --> 10468.64]  That was pretty good. Yeah, okay. I'm into this now. We need electric. I've been thinking on the word electrifying, but they all sound too late
[10468.64 --> 10472.40]  Shocking deals. There we go. So easy. That was such a low-hanging fruit
[10474.24 --> 10476.32]  I'm not I'm not 100% here right now. Okay
[10477.20 --> 10484.00]  What's the example of a blow type point we're talking about wind okay? Yeah, wind blow type or alternatively that's a different show
[10484.64 --> 10486.64]  I'm sure they have that show in Japan, but
[10487.92 --> 10489.92]  What blow type like a tongue?
[10491.12 --> 10494.16]  What that's not a blow type. What are you even talking about? I don't know
[10494.16 --> 10499.76]  Um, I have no idea what was this merch message about?
[10499.76 --> 10503.76]  I don't know. Oh, yeah asking whether we'll have any shipping deals. It's possible
[10504.32 --> 10508.56]  But what I suspect is that we will for a lot of it
[10509.20 --> 10513.28]  Be will be trickling out deals like we've done in the past. So yeah, you'll probably
[10513.84 --> 10519.60]  um, you know pay for shipping, you know more than once if you're into some of the deals and you'll be into them
[10519.60 --> 10520.88]  uh, but
[10521.44 --> 10530.08]  Shipping if we can consolidate shipments on the back end might be one of the only ways that we like makes some okay margin on it
[10530.08 --> 10530.56]  so
[10530.56 --> 10531.60]  um
[10533.76 --> 10535.76]  That might just kind of be how that is
[10536.32 --> 10540.56]  So yeah, yeah, if we if we give it well, i'll give it all away on shipping that might be kind of difficult
[10540.88 --> 10543.20]  Linus has been wheedling down these deals
[10543.20 --> 10545.76]  Okay, that's a specific pokemon. That's not a
[10545.76 --> 10549.76]  It's still pretty funny people are saying like steel type and stuff, but I don't want to get into the newer
[10550.32 --> 10555.36]  Yeah, yeah, there's like too many types. Yeah, I mean that it always bugs me. Ah
[10556.64 --> 10557.84]  Great
[10557.84 --> 10560.08]  Let me make it too complicated
[10561.44 --> 10563.12]  Okay, anyway, uh, me
[10564.16 --> 10572.64]  Did you ever get any more info from google as to why the google workspace and business accounts don't work with so many features that gmail accounts?
[10572.64 --> 10577.84]  Do my understanding is that it has to do with data sharing so they have
[10578.48 --> 10581.36]  Agreements in their business accounts that prevent
[10581.92 --> 10585.60]  data sharing across services and across
[10586.96 --> 10589.28]  Devices and it's simpler for them to just
[10590.56 --> 10594.64]  Disable it then to create a sandbox where only
[10595.20 --> 10598.48]  Um, where where your business accounts data gets isolated
[10598.48 --> 10603.52]  I would prefer if that was just on the workspace admins and it started off by default
[10604.08 --> 10605.36]  Me too. Yeah
[10608.00 --> 10614.96]  Uh, did you see the telecoms outage in australia the second largest mobile isp went down for roughly 18 hours
[10615.36 --> 10618.00]  shutting down pub transport and business
[10618.48 --> 10626.64]  Interested in your thoughts on the independence of mobile isps on our dependence. Sorry our dependence. That's good effort. Um
[10626.64 --> 10632.72]  Um, we had a similar situation with rogers up here actually a little while ago where I think it was payment terminals
[10632.72 --> 10636.80]  Weren't working mobile customers were unable to place calls including
[10637.36 --> 10640.32]  Emergency don't quote me on that part. It was it was really bad though
[10640.88 --> 10641.84]  um, and it
[10642.56 --> 10645.84]  Sparked a very very similar debate up here and I
[10646.88 --> 10649.12]  I hate it, but I don't see a way around it
[10649.12 --> 10653.60]  Like what are we going to do go back to landlines? I don't think it's realistic at this point. I mean even landlines
[10653.60 --> 10654.88]  Yeah
[10655.76 --> 10662.48]  Landlines were incredibly robust by any time that you're reliant on one it's it's the whole german japanese engineering thing
[10662.72 --> 10664.32]  If you're relying on one thing
[10664.96 --> 10666.96]  That one thing could fail
[10667.60 --> 10669.60]  Were there times the landlines were down? Yeah
[10670.16 --> 10672.16]  Were they down very often?
[10672.16 --> 10675.44]  No, they were almost never down, but they technically could
[10676.40 --> 10677.44]  So like
[10677.60 --> 10679.68]  I don't know if you can
[10680.40 --> 10685.84]  Try to have a backup like if you're a business and you would completely cease to function if your
[10686.48 --> 10691.76]  POS terminal went down if you could even if it would be a little messy if you could for a day
[10692.40 --> 10695.04]  Accept payments through some other type of system
[10695.36 --> 10697.36]  Yeah, even if it's like paypal on your phone
[10697.92 --> 10700.56]  Or square that won't help you if your mobile network's down
[10702.64 --> 10703.76]  Uh
[10703.76 --> 10705.76]  PayPal I think you mean paper pal
[10706.72 --> 10707.04]  Well
[10708.16 --> 10709.04]  PayPal could be
[10710.56 --> 10711.68]  Through land
[10711.68 --> 10713.52]  How funny would that be?
[10713.52 --> 10714.08]  Paper pal?
[10714.08 --> 10715.92]  At the badminton center
[10715.92 --> 10720.88]  Getting one of those old-school credit card imprint machines and just like pulling it out to charge people once in a while
[10720.88 --> 10722.88]  Just for lols just to see the look on their face
[10722.88 --> 10727.44]  You're the you're the luckiest, uh, you're you're the lucky 69th customer
[10727.44 --> 10730.00]  Yeah, you're getting credit card imprinting instead of
[10730.00 --> 10733.92]  I don't think I'd do it
[10733.92 --> 10735.44]  That would terrify some people
[10735.44 --> 10737.92]  Yeah, oh, yeah, just taking a duplicate of my credit card
[10737.92 --> 10740.24]  No, that weirded people out back in the day
[10740.56 --> 10745.28]  Oh, yeah, that's the crazy thing about the states though when you go to like pay at a restaurant and they're like
[10745.28 --> 10747.76]  I'm gonna just disappear with your credit card for a while
[10747.76 --> 10748.96]  Yeah, you're not allowed to do that here
[10748.96 --> 10749.92]  What?
[10749.92 --> 10751.68]  They bring the terminal to the table
[10751.68 --> 10754.40]  The fact that that's legal is crazy to me
[10754.40 --> 10756.40]  The fact that people
[10756.40 --> 10758.32]  Well, I don't know
[10758.32 --> 10759.76]  I don't know the fact that
[10759.76 --> 10764.72]  Credit card numbers are so easy to obtain
[10764.72 --> 10772.16]  Oh, yeah in in day-to-day life is is sort of wild to me the fact that they the fact that our credit cards are a fixed number
[10772.16 --> 10776.96]  The fact that social security numbers and sin numbers are a fixed number is just
[10778.08 --> 10785.12]  Bewildering to me at this point like really 16 digits 16 numeric digits. That's your
[10786.40 --> 10789.68]  That's your whole unique identifier scheme. Are you kidding me?
[10791.52 --> 10794.56]  Yeah, I don't have a fix for it though. Sorry. Nope
[10794.56 --> 10800.40]  Was making your home smart worth it? No
[10802.00 --> 10807.60]  Dude the lights going off the land was insane. I was trying to work in your office and it kept going dark every 35 seconds
[10808.08 --> 10812.40]  So that can be configured part of it is just that I like haven't configured everything correctly
[10812.40 --> 10817.36]  But that's a big part of the worth it is how much time it takes to configure everything correctly and it's a
[10818.08 --> 10819.68]  It's a hassle
[10819.76 --> 10820.80]  It's a hassle
[10820.80 --> 10827.20]  What's up boys? I was recently thinking about how fun midnight releases were for games and consoles back in the day
[10827.20 --> 10830.72]  Yeah, do you have any memorable midnight releases that you went to bro?
[10830.96 --> 10831.68]  Halo 2
[10831.68 --> 10837.12]  I went to a bunch but halo 2 was the sickest one. I remember there was these dudes that that backed up there
[10837.12 --> 10842.80]  They had a truck and I think they had a generator or something in the truck and they had an old crt
[10843.12 --> 10848.48]  They had an original xbox and halo 1 and they ran like a little halo 1 tournament in the halo 2 lineup
[10848.48 --> 10851.92]  Which was dope in that same lineup the people that got there first
[10852.56 --> 10855.52]  brought like a camping table and risk
[10856.72 --> 10861.52]  And they just showed up like way earlier than you would expect to but they just played an entire game of risk
[10861.92 --> 10865.12]  And then the game released because risk takes so long
[10865.68 --> 10871.44]  So they're just like whatever we we just play risk at home or you know, we just play it here when we get halo first
[10871.44 --> 10877.44]  It's like that's pretty cool. There was like the halo 2 lineup was legendary. I remember I had gotten
[10879.12 --> 10886.72]  Whatever it was like xbox magazine. Yeah, that that had like a some halo thing on the cover or whatever my mom got it for me
[10887.68 --> 10892.88]  So I had read like all the articles and xbox magazine about halo and they had this like
[10893.44 --> 10899.60]  Contest in the line and an eb games employee. I don't even think it's called that anymore. Is it game stop up here?
[10899.60 --> 10905.28]  No, I think so. No, it's still eb games. Okay, cool. Yeah, um an eb games employee came out and was like asking quiz questions
[10905.28 --> 10912.56]  I need the answers to everything because I just read read the thing like a billion times because what else am I gonna do?
[10913.12 --> 10913.60]  um
[10914.48 --> 10916.80]  And I saw I won something I don't even remember what it was
[10917.20 --> 10922.40]  It was it was great the dude ended up getting mad because I was like the only one putting up my hand for a bunch of the questions
[10922.40 --> 10925.44]  He's like no, it has to be someone else. I was like, nope. It's only me
[10926.40 --> 10927.76]  got him
[10927.76 --> 10928.80]  Um
[10928.80 --> 10934.24]  You know what i'm gonna give a different answer than you're probably expecting I could talk about my uh nintendo wii
[10934.88 --> 10935.84]  uh midnight launches
[10935.84 --> 10939.04]  Yeah, i'm gonna talk about the time that I was on the other side of one
[10939.60 --> 10944.48]  Oh, I got to participate in a number of ncix. Oh, uh grand openings
[10945.04 --> 10950.16]  Those are grand openings. Yeah. Yeah, those were those are super wild. Um, I you did one
[10950.64 --> 10956.40]  When I worked with you at ncix, but like this was really early on so I was not a part of it. Yeah, it was uh
[10956.40 --> 10958.08]  The the the the energy
[10958.64 --> 10961.20]  Uh on the other side I did it. I did a handful of them
[10961.20 --> 10965.36]  I was there for langley my very first day at ncix was the grand opening of the langley location
[10966.16 --> 10968.08]  I was just an assistant. I was just like a runner
[10968.48 --> 10972.72]  Um and the experienced sales people that we pulled from other locations dealt with all the actual
[10973.04 --> 10976.08]  customers and software and everything which didn't make sense to me at the time
[10976.08 --> 10980.40]  I was like I could handle it and then I saw how convoluted and awful their software was later and like, oh, yeah
[10980.40 --> 10984.24]  It's probably a good reason only experienced people want to touch this piece of garbage. Yeah
[10984.32 --> 10985.28]  um
[10985.28 --> 10993.68]  And man the I flew out for one or two of the toronto grand openings or like like ontario grand openings and the toronto area
[10994.00 --> 10996.00]  Sorry, sorry mississauga. Um
[10997.12 --> 10999.12]  No, it's a real city. I know
[11000.08 --> 11006.16]  Sort of uh, just just like how langley is a real city. Sorry. Sorry langley. Um, it's vancouver man
[11006.16 --> 11008.16]  Get real. Um
[11008.64 --> 11012.24]  Well, what else was it? Yeah, yeah, it was it was really fun. Just like
[11013.28 --> 11019.04]  You know going out hyping up the crowd, you know chucking stuff at people, you know doing like quizzes like you said
[11019.04 --> 11023.36]  Like I I did a lot of that stuff. So that being like genuinely miss midlight launch
[11023.36 --> 11027.20]  Yeah, being like that like the hype master for for the launch was was really fun
[11027.20 --> 11030.32]  If there was still midnight launches now I would go to them now
[11030.80 --> 11032.32]  Like a hundred percent. Okay
[11033.12 --> 11034.56]  Okay, we should do a midnight launch
[11034.56 --> 11035.68]  I'm down
[11035.68 --> 11037.12]  Uh, okay
[11037.12 --> 11038.48]  What should we do it for?
[11039.36 --> 11040.96]  Do you mean like ltt store products?
[11040.96 --> 11045.44]  Yeah, are we just doing mock? No like a product. Okay. Yeah, like we should launch something
[11045.92 --> 11051.28]  Sure, like we kind of did a pop-up for the backpack, but but it'll have to be at midnight. Yeah, um, okay
[11051.28 --> 11054.16]  Well, you know what here I'd rather than committing to something now
[11054.48 --> 11057.52]  Why don't I just we'd have to release it on the store at midnight, too
[11058.16 --> 11058.48]  Yeah
[11058.48 --> 11062.88]  I'm just gonna send a cryptic email to nick light
[11062.88 --> 11067.60]  It just says a midnight launch in the subject line and then contains no other information nice
[11067.60 --> 11069.20]  He likes it when I do that good
[11069.20 --> 11071.20]  Yeah
[11071.20 --> 11073.36]  Okay, what else we got?
[11073.36 --> 11083.52]  Uh, luke what was the transition to a management type position like I currently have two offers painful one for exciting technical work
[11083.52 --> 11089.12]  And another for management, which is very financially enticing take the exciting technical work
[11091.52 --> 11093.44]  Managing people sucks. Yeah
[11094.00 --> 11096.00]  Kind of that think about every like
[11096.00 --> 11101.20]  You've ever met in your life now imagine that you're responsible for
[11102.24 --> 11104.24]  Like dealing with their bulls**t
[11104.24 --> 11110.00]  You also manage very nice people. I do. Yeah, like I am relatively sheltered
[11110.00 --> 11113.36]  Yeah, like we have an amazing company full of amazing people
[11116.24 --> 11119.12]  If I had to if I had to manage general population
[11120.32 --> 11121.52]  I'd quit
[11121.52 --> 11125.60]  Honestly, yeah, yeah, definitely like full stop. It also it also like hyper depends on
[11126.24 --> 11127.84]  I'm sure the company that you work at
[11128.80 --> 11130.32]  Like I don't mind doing it here
[11132.88 --> 11135.84]  There's places that I have worked where I would not be willing
[11136.96 --> 11137.84]  You know, like
[11139.04 --> 11139.92]  I don't know
[11139.92 --> 11146.96]  Um, the reason why I said painful was because for me I had to realize like all the ways I would have hated managing myself
[11148.08 --> 11150.32]  Um, which was a bit of a painful experience
[11150.96 --> 11155.12]  Yeah, a little smug over there. Um, because he had to do it get wrecked
[11156.56 --> 11156.96]  Nerd
[11157.52 --> 11158.00]  Um
[11159.28 --> 11164.64]  So yeah, that kind of sucked a little bit, but it was probably good for me as like a human to be honest
[11165.20 --> 11165.68]  um
[11167.04 --> 11168.16]  Fair enough. Um
[11169.44 --> 11169.76]  But
[11169.76 --> 11172.88]  Yeah, the actual aspect of managing there's
[11174.24 --> 11174.80]  I don't know
[11174.80 --> 11180.96]  There's a lot of negatives you have to deal with everything if if if in my opinion you're going to do it properly
[11181.36 --> 11182.56]  and not just be like
[11183.68 --> 11184.32]  dead weight
[11185.36 --> 11185.68]  and
[11186.32 --> 11187.68]  yada yada yada yada
[11187.68 --> 11188.00]  then
[11188.88 --> 11189.60]  uh
[11189.60 --> 11191.28]  It should roll
[11191.28 --> 11192.32]  uphill, right?
[11192.32 --> 11194.88]  So you're going to be dealing with a lot of bad
[11196.56 --> 11198.00]  And not really that much good
[11199.12 --> 11202.96]  Because most of the good is going to be claimed by your team
[11202.96 --> 11204.48]  Yeah, you should be crediting your team
[11204.48 --> 11206.88]  Yeah, you should be taking responsibility when things go wrong
[11206.88 --> 11207.60]  Yeah, so
[11208.40 --> 11212.56]  So basically they do everything good you do everything bad
[11214.16 --> 11215.44]  And that's like I like it
[11216.16 --> 11218.16]  Yeah, because it means I only have to yell at one person
[11218.16 --> 11221.52]  Yeah, well not I taren but whatever. Yeah, um
[11222.16 --> 11225.12]  And that's like in my opinion that is more or less how you should do it because
[11226.80 --> 11229.52]  And like that that doesn't mean you just do that infinitely
[11229.52 --> 11234.00]  Like if if there's one person that just literally screws up 100 of the time
[11234.88 --> 11237.76]  Then it's it's on you you need to cycle that person out
[11238.00 --> 11242.00]  It doesn't necessarily mean that that person's like an idiot or a loser or something
[11242.24 --> 11244.56]  They just might not be in the correct role for them
[11244.88 --> 11246.08]  And sometimes it does
[11246.08 --> 11248.32]  Maybe but you know, i'm trying to be nice
[11249.52 --> 11250.96]  So part of it is like
[11252.40 --> 11257.12]  If you keep them in a position where they are constantly failing you're not doing them a favor
[11257.12 --> 11263.92]  It's it's actually bad for both sides and you need to help move this process along which can be very challenging
[11263.92 --> 11269.52]  It's brutal sometimes the business and the individuals have conflicting needs and sometimes
[11269.52 --> 11272.08]  um, people don't realize
[11273.12 --> 11278.16]  What is best for them necessarily and that doesn't again that doesn't mean they're idiots. It doesn't mean they're losers
[11278.16 --> 11282.00]  It just means sometimes your nose is too close to something to see the bigger picture like it can be
[11284.08 --> 11287.60]  People are messy, right? Like, uh, you know, just managing
[11288.32 --> 11289.20]  AI
[11289.20 --> 11292.48]  LLMs would probably be easier even with all the hallucinations
[11292.48 --> 11296.24]  Um, life is challenging like sometimes sometimes people can
[11297.04 --> 11303.04]  Sometimes people can change really quickly for reasons that have nothing to do with work and it are not even their fault, right?
[11303.84 --> 11304.72]  Life is messy
[11304.72 --> 11311.20]  So life is life is messy and you spend like most of your life working or thinking about work
[11311.76 --> 11312.64]  as far as I can tell
[11312.64 --> 11313.20]  um
[11313.20 --> 11313.76]  um
[11314.48 --> 11318.48]  With within within eight hours a week five days a week set up
[11319.28 --> 11319.68]  with
[11320.08 --> 11321.60]  commute time and
[11322.40 --> 11322.80]  um
[11323.52 --> 11327.04]  Like prepping for work time whatever you want to call that. Yep.
[11327.04 --> 11327.60]  Um
[11327.60 --> 11329.84]  All all the other things involved
[11330.40 --> 11336.48]  Uh with it such a huge percentage of your life is work and you you see all this stuff going around these days that is like
[11336.48 --> 11337.44]  um
[11338.32 --> 11339.92]  Oh, like everyone's
[11340.64 --> 11341.76]  Super
[11341.76 --> 11344.16]  Anxious and the world's on fire and all this kind of stuff
[11344.16 --> 11349.52]  It's like, okay, well, um part of the the hidden part of being a manager is you're now like a
[11351.20 --> 11353.20]  The support structure
[11353.20 --> 11357.84]  For everyone on this team because you're not just like the the way that I when people
[11358.56 --> 11361.44]  That aren't in our little circle kind of asked me what I do
[11361.84 --> 11365.36]  I I try to just define it as like I just I basically I remove blocks
[11366.32 --> 11368.32]  I try to keep the team moving
[11368.32 --> 11369.28]  Professional uh
[11369.84 --> 11371.52]  Jenga player. Yeah block mover
[11372.56 --> 11374.56]  um
[11374.56 --> 11378.00]  That can be distilled in a lot of ways though and sometimes that is not
[11378.72 --> 11382.48]  Like oh you go on trello you see a task is blocked you follow it up
[11382.48 --> 11388.64]  You make sure these people are communicating you figure out how to do whatever that's ideal. That is ideal. Yeah
[11388.72 --> 11391.44]  That part's actually like kind of cool. Yeah, you know
[11391.44 --> 11392.40]  I don't know
[11392.40 --> 11394.24]  It's not the most common version of it
[11395.60 --> 11398.48]  Um, and sometimes it can it can be really taxing
[11398.72 --> 11402.00]  Um to have your own stuff going on
[11402.72 --> 11403.12]  um
[11404.08 --> 11405.20]  And then need to help
[11407.20 --> 11409.04]  Manage other people's stuff as well. I don't know
[11409.60 --> 11414.24]  So sometimes it's really rewarding. Sometimes it's really taxing. Sometimes it's really good. Sometimes it's really bad
[11414.56 --> 11420.88]  It's it's like, uh, I don't know. It's it's a very interesting position. I think it's been good for me as a human, but
[11421.44 --> 11423.44]  I don't think it would be good for everyone
[11425.92 --> 11427.76]  I'll say this if you're still really young
[11428.64 --> 11433.92]  Maybe do the fun technical position. Yeah, I I don't know that I would jump into managing people again. Yeah
[11435.12 --> 11441.44]  There yep that I can stand behind but uh, there is a lot of career path to managing people because honestly
[11441.68 --> 11445.52]  A not a p of not a lot of people want to do it, but if you're being offered that today
[11446.40 --> 11448.40]  It is also possible that you will
[11449.44 --> 11455.04]  Work your way there again, you'll very likely be and something that you could do if you want to stay on the technical side
[11455.44 --> 11461.28]  Is become like a technical lead for a small team and if you're doing something that's really fun
[11461.84 --> 11464.40]  That still seems cool and you have an aptitude for it. It's
[11464.96 --> 11472.56]  Possible that you will end up kicking so much butt that you will not only get offered some kind of supervisory or managerial position again
[11472.56 --> 11474.80]  But maybe an even better one. I don't know that too
[11474.80 --> 11479.20]  Like i'm not familiar with your exact situation. You don't have to jump now and everything's everything's a
[11480.48 --> 11485.84]  Everything's a gamble, right? You can never go back and take a path that you that you didn't take
[11486.40 --> 11489.20]  Um, so just you know do your best with it. Have fun
[11489.76 --> 11491.60]  There is either way a ton
[11492.24 --> 11497.44]  Of bad managers and there's a ton of companies that have a really really hard time filling managerial roles
[11497.44 --> 11500.80]  So those roles will be there. Don't worry about it
[11502.40 --> 11510.64]  Linus I have been sucked into anno 1800. I just added all the extra seasons any tips for maintaining all the extra worlds
[11510.64 --> 11513.28]  Okay, this is a bad tip because it's
[11514.00 --> 11521.52]  You lose the ability to gain certain special items and stuff like that because you can only get them from completing quests for npcs
[11521.52 --> 11526.80]  But I just kill all the npcs that helps a lot and then I also kill all the pirates
[11527.28 --> 11534.16]  Destroy their hideouts and then I camp their bases so that they can never rebuild. That was really fun. Yeah. Yeah, luke luke was like
[11534.16 --> 11537.68]  Oh playing co-op is also really good. Uh, luke was like my
[11538.48 --> 11543.68]  My just my scourge of the seven seas just like destroyer. He was our military arm
[11543.68 --> 11549.76]  I actually got really into like the micromanaging of the ships to make them take less damage and do more damage and all this kind of stuff
[11549.76 --> 11552.32]  Because repairing them is like a pain in the butt and stuff
[11553.04 --> 11556.96]  Which makes sense to be yeah, which makes a ton of sense for a for a game like anno
[11557.76 --> 11562.56]  And then I was all about uh, you know trade routes and stuff use trade routes trade routes are so
[11563.12 --> 11564.32]  So so so so important
[11564.96 --> 11569.20]  um, and then you know, there's a lot of little tips like setting up your trade routes so that
[11570.08 --> 11571.12]  um, you over produce
[11571.76 --> 11573.52]  up the line and then
[11574.24 --> 11579.60]  Have enough for everyone down the line and then dump to one of the npcs that will buy anything and then
[11579.60 --> 11580.88]  rinse and repeat
[11580.88 --> 11586.32]  um, make sure you get lots of the uh, like the gold and purple propellers
[11586.80 --> 11588.72]  So that your ships go faster
[11588.72 --> 11593.12]  That is so much more cost effective in the very long term than just building more ships
[11594.08 --> 11595.76]  I mean, I could talk about anno for like
[11596.88 --> 11599.36]  As long as I could play anno probably which is a lot
[11599.36 --> 11602.40]  So we're not going to do too much more of this. But uh, yeah, what's next?
[11602.88 --> 11606.88]  Did luke ever beat baldur's gate three? What's his most recent opinion?
[11606.88 --> 11612.08]  No, actually, i've been a little bit more time i've i've progressed i've been a little bit more time limited though
[11612.08 --> 11614.32]  And i've been trying to put the time that I have had
[11614.80 --> 11620.24]  Uh into final fantasy 6 because i'm trying to play that and it's been really fun. Um,
[11620.56 --> 11622.00]  Oh, yeah, I guess I need an update
[11622.24 --> 11624.72]  No, I haven't progressed because this week i've just been like sleeping
[11624.96 --> 11629.52]  So I haven't progressed since like before the land right so got it. Yeah, yeah makes sense. Um
[11629.52 --> 11634.56]  um, but yeah, I i'm also like i'm not trying to rush through it because
[11635.20 --> 11637.52]  I'm, just really enjoying it and I don't
[11638.16 --> 11643.04]  I have no desire looking at how much some of my friends on steam play it
[11643.52 --> 11646.72]  Maybe I can't burn out on it. I don't know but i'll just skate yeah
[11647.04 --> 11649.04]  there's people that I see they'll just like
[11649.76 --> 11651.60]  Log in and play it and then go to bed
[11652.16 --> 11656.32]  Every day and they're still doing that and that's a little wild to me, but um
[11656.32 --> 11662.72]  Um, I don't want to burn out on it because basically any time someone's like hey, we should play ball there skate i'm just like yes
[11663.76 --> 11666.32]  Let's do it. Usually that results in nothing, but
[11666.96 --> 11672.24]  I I like that i'm very open to that so I have like actually 10 billion campaigns that are nice one
[11672.80 --> 11673.92]  um
[11673.92 --> 11678.96]  Nice, and then I have my my own personal campaign which has progressed further than that, but yeah
[11681.20 --> 11686.16]  Uh, hey ldl what is a better way to play games on a tv in a different room?
[11686.40 --> 11692.64]  hdmi and usbc over cat 5 nvidia shield wi-fi nvidia shield ethernet over power
[11693.12 --> 11695.60]  Also looking forward to pajama shorts
[11696.40 --> 11701.28]  I mean definitely a hard line like optical cable if you can pull it off
[11702.08 --> 11708.40]  Uh failing that I would say a thin client running steam link or moonlight or something like that would be my my next
[11709.28 --> 11711.28]  preferred option
[11711.28 --> 11715.20]  Okay, i've got some more potentials here if you want to have a look at those linus this last one
[11715.20 --> 11719.20]  I have curated is for luke question for luke what are your thoughts on?
[11720.08 --> 11726.32]  200 cc as an avid mk8 player don't like it my friend and I absolutely loved that addition, but
[11726.96 --> 11728.96]  always felt in the minority
[11729.52 --> 11736.24]  Also cable management when yeah, I I feel like so here's here's my thoughts on that. I the reason why I like
[11737.12 --> 11738.24]  Mario kart so much
[11738.24 --> 11740.80]  um is drifting and
[11740.80 --> 11741.60]  I
[11741.60 --> 11748.48]  Really feel like the maps in mario kart 8 were designed for drifting at 150 cc
[11749.12 --> 11752.88]  Oh, so when you incorporate 200 cc the drifting felt a little broken
[11753.28 --> 11754.72]  um
[11754.72 --> 11758.08]  Now if I spent more time with it could I maybe figured it out?
[11758.40 --> 11761.04]  Maybe I don't know but the natural lines
[11761.60 --> 11768.56]  Where if you're if you're going at like high maintained speed and you drift into this corner the natural lines at 150 cc
[11768.56 --> 11771.36]  Just make a lot of sense to me. There's certain maps where like
[11771.76 --> 11773.60]  It doesn't feel like you should be able to do it
[11773.60 --> 11777.68]  But if you just commit and you hold the line you're gonna slide like
[11778.08 --> 11780.08]  Bumper over the grass like just
[11781.04 --> 11784.32]  Like really really tight lines like they it feels really crafted
[11784.80 --> 11789.52]  For that exact experience and then you put it to 200 cc and those lines don't work
[11790.00 --> 11790.80]  um, so
[11791.68 --> 11793.52]  I always preferred 150
[11793.52 --> 11799.60]  Um, and it makes sense to me that most competitive stuff and whatnot is all at 150 because it feels like the game's made for it
[11800.16 --> 11804.40]  Um, but I mean, I never gave it too much time a day so I could be wrong
[11804.40 --> 11811.12]  Hi, lld hope all is well. Just wondering how come lenovo is rarely covered?
[11811.28 --> 11816.24]  They weren't in secret chopper no review of the legion go is it a coincidence or have they
[11817.04 --> 11820.96]  fallen off the uh, are they on the ldd naughty list?
[11820.96 --> 11823.28]  Um, they're not on a naughty list of any sort
[11823.52 --> 11830.64]  I I think that they're just in kind of a like an awkward position sometimes like I I don't know what happened with the legion go other than that
[11830.64 --> 11832.96]  We didn't get seated one and um
[11833.84 --> 11838.48]  So we didn't cover it. Uh, we didn't we've been really busy
[11838.96 --> 11842.72]  So it's not like we were going it's not like we were desperate for video topics
[11842.72 --> 11846.88]  So we weren't gonna go and line up queue up to buy one or whatever else
[11846.96 --> 11848.56]  uh, we would have we would have needed to be
[11849.20 --> 11850.96]  Uh seated that and even then like it
[11851.60 --> 11855.20]  Would have been a decision for us to make whether we were going to do a video about it or not
[11855.20 --> 11860.40]  um, um, and a lot of the time I feel like their products are like safe
[11861.04 --> 11863.84]  I guess lenovo does a lot of stuff that's
[11864.72 --> 11866.64]  um solid and
[11868.40 --> 11869.60]  Not a ton to say about it
[11869.60 --> 11873.76]  It feels like the kind of product that might be easier for us to cover on labs
[11874.32 --> 11876.00]  um versus on
[11876.56 --> 11879.12]  um, you know short circuit or ltt
[11880.16 --> 11884.88]  I know that we have had some difficulty dealing with them at times in the past, but I
[11885.76 --> 11889.92]  Am so far removed from that at this point that I have no idea if that remains an issue or not
[11891.28 --> 11897.52]  Linus for final fantasy six do you prefer the name tina tara or does it even matter tina?
[11901.84 --> 11903.36]  Hashtag not my protagonist
[11905.92 --> 11907.92]  It's pretty cut and dry
[11907.92 --> 11915.12]  Hi lld recently got engaged would love any advice for the wedding day either from your personal experience
[11915.20 --> 11919.52]  Or advice you've gotten from loved ones my fiancee says ask yvonne
[11920.24 --> 11922.48]  Most important thing is remember it's not about you
[11924.96 --> 11925.60]  That's key
[11926.48 --> 11930.24]  This is a party for your parents and your loved ones. You are the host
[11931.52 --> 11934.80]  You are not the uh, the attendee
[11935.36 --> 11937.28]  So if you remember that
[11938.00 --> 11941.84]  Then all of a sudden other people's meddling becomes less upsetting
[11942.88 --> 11945.52]  All of a sudden the busyness of the day becomes
[11946.40 --> 11948.56]  Part of the journey and less
[11948.80 --> 11951.68]  um an obstacle to enjoying it
[11952.00 --> 11952.32]  um
[11953.20 --> 11958.32]  That was a big sort of mentality shift that I think helped us actually enjoy it a lot more
[11958.88 --> 11961.60]  Was understanding that no we weren't going to have time to sit and eat
[11963.52 --> 11964.88]  You know, we um
[11964.88 --> 11969.60]  You know, no, uh, we're we're not going to be able to keep the guest list just to the people we know personally
[11969.60 --> 11971.76]  Our parents are going to want to invite
[11972.56 --> 11975.92]  Their friends and loved ones who we don't really have relationships with
[11976.48 --> 11976.88]  um
[11978.40 --> 11983.60]  It helps a lot that in chinese culture. It's a lot more normal to just bring cash
[11984.16 --> 11990.00]  to these kinds of events like it's it's pretty um, it's pretty typical unless you traveled
[11990.48 --> 11995.12]  Like on a plane, uh, it's pretty typical to cover your plate and some
[11996.08 --> 12000.40]  So inviting more people to the wedding is not a big deal. Honestly, it seems like a really good system
[12000.64 --> 12004.08]  It makes a lot of sense. Like I was looking at it going this is
[12005.12 --> 12009.68]  Genius, how is this not the complete norm? Absolutely. It makes a ton of sense
[12010.00 --> 12016.08]  Because for the individuals like like when I hear about people who spent car money on their wedding
[12016.56 --> 12023.52]  Like money they actually no longer had after the wedding after going through the process with my wife
[12023.52 --> 12027.68]  I I I I look at that and I go well, that's insane
[12028.40 --> 12032.24]  People should pay their own way at the wedding and if they're not willing to pay, you know
[12032.72 --> 12039.36]  80 bucks a head or 100 bucks a head or whatever, you know the banquet and and and all of that is then they probably shouldn't be there
[12040.80 --> 12044.72]  No offense and if everyone you know can't afford that
[12045.92 --> 12049.52]  And and you're not a mega baller who can just afford to cover everyone's way
[12049.52 --> 12053.52]  Well, you know, maybe a strategy shift. Yeah
[12053.52 --> 12056.56]  Would be in order like like when I hear about people going in debt
[12056.56 --> 12062.32]  That's the big one for a wedding that is not the right foot to start your life off together on
[12062.32 --> 12064.88]  That's not something that I would have considered acceptable
[12065.36 --> 12070.96]  Um back when we got started and like I said, we were lucky enough that I was introduced to this
[12071.60 --> 12072.80]  amazing
[12072.80 --> 12078.48]  Way better way of doing things such that having more people at the wedding wasn't more costly
[12078.48 --> 12082.16]  Um, but yeah, that was that was that's a big thing is just remember
[12082.16 --> 12084.32]  It's not about you and just let go
[12085.12 --> 12086.08]  Have fun
[12086.80 --> 12088.88]  Last week you talked about can I throw something in there?
[12088.88 --> 12092.16]  Yeah, as someone who has not gone through this process and I am
[12092.72 --> 12098.48]  A thousand percent stealing this from linus, but I don't think he's said this publicly. So it's mine now get owned
[12099.04 --> 12100.72]  This is my thing
[12100.72 --> 12105.84]  Okay, not linus is anymore. Okay, this is mine. Wow. He's so assertive today. It's mine
[12106.64 --> 12107.68]  Okay, it's yours
[12107.68 --> 12109.68]  What is it?
[12109.68 --> 12112.24]  But when you're when you're doing your your vows
[12113.36 --> 12115.36]  You can chill out
[12117.36 --> 12123.04]  He knows what i'm doing here. Oh boy, there's there's been examples where people will kind of like
[12124.00 --> 12126.24]  Lay into each other in a negative way
[12127.04 --> 12130.64]  In their vows and it's just like you guys can hash that out another time
[12131.28 --> 12135.12]  It doesn't need to happen right now. I have actually witnessed this. Yeah, me too
[12135.12 --> 12137.84]  So like when you're going up there and you're like, you know
[12138.48 --> 12139.28]  talk about what
[12139.28 --> 12144.24]  You bring to the table not what you expect the other person to bring to the table
[12144.24 --> 12146.80]  That one too. I haven't witnessed that one
[12146.80 --> 12149.12]  Yeah, but I have witnessed the like
[12149.12 --> 12153.68]  Very broken
[12153.68 --> 12157.84]  Had a lot of negative times. We've been through the ringer. It's like
[12157.84 --> 12159.84]  None of that matters right now
[12159.84 --> 12164.32]  Yeah, oh so so the context for what I was saying was
[12164.32 --> 12166.88]  Uh, it can be like very backhanded
[12167.52 --> 12168.00]  Oh, yeah
[12168.00 --> 12169.60]  Like the um, you know
[12169.60 --> 12172.00]  I just think in general like just
[12172.64 --> 12174.64]  Just have a positive moment
[12175.12 --> 12177.60]  It's okay. Yeah, like I I don't know
[12178.24 --> 12180.40]  In my opinion, I mean you can do whatever the heck you want
[12180.40 --> 12184.40]  You don't have to listen to anything that lians and I just said you could have a wedding with
[12185.04 --> 12192.00]  One person in attendance and you don't care what they think and you don't give them any food and none of it matters
[12192.80 --> 12197.20]  Or you can have one where you only say negative vows literally nothing matters. Who cares?
[12197.20 --> 12201.60]  Do it your way. These are just suggestions, but I just find like when you're sitting there
[12202.00 --> 12207.28]  With like a whole whack ton of people and the bride and groom are standing up there talking about their vows
[12207.68 --> 12209.52]  And they just dog into each other
[12211.04 --> 12213.04]  It's pretty uncomfortable for everyone
[12213.28 --> 12217.04]  We had a lot of hard times and you were really tough to deal with at the beginning
[12217.60 --> 12220.40]  And it was really really hard to get here
[12220.40 --> 12222.48]  Like what do they think they're doing the land show?
[12222.48 --> 12223.12]  But we made
[12223.12 --> 12224.48]  Yeah, yeah, really?
[12224.48 --> 12228.80]  Yeah, but we made it it's like, okay, uh, I don't know
[12229.36 --> 12234.32]  We don't have to do this right now. Yeah, like just talk about this like in a lot of ways
[12234.32 --> 12237.04]  It's supposed to be the start of something right?
[12237.92 --> 12241.52]  Like yes, you've been together for a long time, but it's supposed to be the start of something. So like
[12242.24 --> 12245.68]  You know, maybe leave that baggage. Yep. I don't know
[12245.68 --> 12250.56]  Last week you talked about final fantasy 6 with luke
[12250.56 --> 12256.24]  Yeah, I wonder what other final fantasy games you've played and if you still keep up with the modern games at all
[12256.24 --> 12261.44]  I have not kept up with critically acclaimed mmorpg final fantasy 14. I'm afraid
[12262.00 --> 12264.56]  um, the last one I played was
[12266.48 --> 12267.52]  Oh boy
[12267.52 --> 12272.16]  People like 14. I think no, no, I it's it's like a no, I know that's a meme, but yeah
[12272.88 --> 12274.08]  I did not play 12
[12277.52 --> 12278.56]  What the heck is 11?
[12279.44 --> 12282.08]  Oh, no 11 was an mmo last one. I played is 10
[12283.04 --> 12283.84]  I'm a little behind
[12283.84 --> 12289.68]  No, I haven't I haven't seen or heard anything that would compel me to play any of the more recent ones
[12289.68 --> 12291.68]  Except the most recent one
[12291.68 --> 12295.84]  Uh, david said I have to play it, but I don't have a playstation. It's supposed to be super good. Yeah
[12296.24 --> 12301.28]  Yeah, i'm also waiting for the pc release that will be then well, that's pretty
[12301.76 --> 12304.64]  Given I guess that'll be the newest one I've played once it actually comes to pc
[12305.20 --> 12305.52]  um
[12306.40 --> 12312.56]  Then the next one after that in regards to newest version that i've played not most recent that i've played would be final fantasy 8
[12314.24 --> 12315.52]  Yeah, someone said uh
[12315.52 --> 12319.36]  Someone said 10 is a good one to go out on
[12320.48 --> 12320.72]  Yeah
[12322.56 --> 12328.00]  No, i've heard a ton of super positive stuff about the most recent one. Yeah, actually it's supposed to be amazing
[12329.28 --> 12331.28]  Yeah
[12331.28 --> 12337.04]  Linus as a very busy man, how do you decide what media to consume in your limited downtime choice paralysis?
[12337.04 --> 12339.04]  I have no idea. Oh, I
[12340.00 --> 12344.64]  I struggled. I usually watch reruns because I just I can't
[12345.52 --> 12350.08]  I can't allocate enough of my brain to deciding on and then
[12350.96 --> 12352.88]  being committed to new media
[12354.00 --> 12356.00]  It's a big problem for me
[12357.12 --> 12362.64]  Linus, what do you think about the oc remix versions of the final fantasy 6 music? I think it's fantastic
[12363.76 --> 12365.12]  um
[12365.12 --> 12367.12]  So I loaded this up here
[12368.00 --> 12373.44]  Someone on uh, our google or someone on our youtube account apparently already looked at these but it wasn't me
[12373.44 --> 12374.64]  Um
[12386.32 --> 12389.28]  Are you listening to the show at the same time? Yeah
[12392.32 --> 12392.64]  Nice
[12392.64 --> 12398.08]  Oh, yeah, there's your problem. I don't know sounds like they go pretty hard. I'll have to check these out another time
[12398.08 --> 12400.08]  I wasn't familiar with them
[12403.36 --> 12407.28]  What do you want to see from the live action legend of zelda?
[12408.08 --> 12408.96]  I want
[12409.84 --> 12412.16]  Kind of a dark serious tone. I
[12412.16 --> 12415.76]  think that's a lot to ask for from nintendo. Yeah, but I want it to be
[12415.76 --> 12418.72]  Kind of gritty not gritty, but
[12420.40 --> 12420.72]  um
[12422.16 --> 12423.68]  I don't want it to be for my
[12425.68 --> 12429.52]  Six-year-old I want it to be for like my preteen if that makes sense
[12432.08 --> 12435.52]  I want scarlet johansson like what they did with ghosts in the shell
[12436.00 --> 12440.16]  That was a great choice with you and scarlet johannison by the way not johansson
[12440.16 --> 12446.88]  I'm doing a bit. I'm doing a bit you're doing it poorly. Ah, ah I learned from you
[12447.84 --> 12448.72]  Hey, lld
[12450.64 --> 12456.88]  I was recently shopping for some collab apparel and was wondering what tech brand or other ip
[12456.88 --> 12461.44]  You would love to collaborate with for ltd gear sky's the limit purely hypothetical
[12462.40 --> 12468.64]  I think other creators would be more fun or really fun. I um, I don't have like a ton of
[12468.64 --> 12472.48]  Ah, man, I don't know. I mean, it'd be cool to do like a
[12477.52 --> 12477.84]  Ah
[12479.28 --> 12484.72]  I don't know maybe i'm maybe I shouldn't have curated this I curated this and then I didn't even think about the answer wall
[12485.36 --> 12488.64]  Uh, what I assumed at nasa tech brand or other ip
[12489.60 --> 12493.92]  Yeah, but their logo is so corporate and boring like what would we even do with it? No, it's sick
[12495.44 --> 12497.44]  It's sick
[12497.76 --> 12503.44]  It's awesome. You don't have like a team of designers to do fun things with the nasa logo. Yeah, I guess that's true, but like
[12504.72 --> 12511.20]  Okay, sure. No, nasa is a ldt brand design language in itself orange spacesuits. Come on
[12511.76 --> 12518.16]  Tell me you're a fanboy. I think without telling me you're a fanboy. I think nasa punk is like a thing nasa punk
[12518.16 --> 12520.16]  Shut up. Yeah, nasa punk
[12523.52 --> 12524.24]  NASA punk
[12525.76 --> 12526.24]  Here we go
[12527.12 --> 12529.12]  This is so starfield
[12529.20 --> 12534.16]  Okay, yeah, no, this is not a thing. I'm sorry. I think it is a thing though. No, I don't buy this
[12535.04 --> 12540.16]  No, but like what's what's that? Um, tom sax tom sax nasa
[12540.16 --> 12548.72]  Okay, like there's a famous artist dude. That's just the lunar lander. Oh my god
[12548.72 --> 12549.84]  Oh my goodness
[12550.88 --> 12552.80]  Oh, I can't find like
[12552.80 --> 12554.80]  Uh
[12555.68 --> 12556.32]  Wow
[12556.32 --> 12557.84]  This is really compelling a toilet
[12558.96 --> 12559.36]  Brilliant
[12561.12 --> 12566.96]  Here make this I don't even know what it is sell that looks like a pinball machine with one of the super checks hockey games under it
[12566.96 --> 12568.96]  I have no idea what i'm looking at. Oh
[12569.52 --> 12571.36]  Then now you can play super checks at your own height
[12574.48 --> 12575.92]  All right, well, this has been a good show
[12576.64 --> 12577.92]  Thanks everybody for tuning in
[12578.80 --> 12581.76]  We will see you again next week. Same bad time. Same bad channel
[12583.28 --> 12585.28]  Bye
[12585.28 --> 12587.28]  Oh
[12592.72 --> 12597.60]  When the brains lagging you can go for the really junky joke. He's sick and I'm ill-equipped
[12600.96 --> 12602.96]  Oh, man
[12615.28 --> 12617.28]  Thanks
[12621.92 --> 12622.72]  Hi
