[0.00 → 1.84] And welcome to the WAN show!
[2.72 → 5.24] Really Luke? Like, you can't text later?
[5.70 → 8.66] I was turning the ring volume down so I wouldn't bother anybody during this show.
[8.86 → 10.84] I was trying to be considerate, Linus!
[10.92 → 13.68] We have got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[14.34 → 19.70] I mean, one of the big topics is, what is the deal with brands that we don't work with
[19.70 → 22.08] keeping my picture on their product pages?
[22.20 → 26.46] We're going to be talking about that because that is super not cool.
[26.46 → 34.22] We're also going to be talking about the recent controversy with one of our testing guys from the lab
[34.22 → 39.28] saying something on camera and then it kind of got spicy and something.
[39.48 → 44.24] So basically we're going to just talk through what happened, what the best way to move forward is.
[44.26 → 45.62] What else are we going to be talking about today?
[45.82 → 51.12] Twitch expands gambling restrictions while another platform definitely does not do that.
[51.98 → 54.08] And another topic.
[54.56 → 55.18] Really Luke?
[55.18 → 56.60] Weak.
[57.60 → 58.60] Absolutely weak.
[59.32 → 60.14] Baldur's Gate 3!
[60.14 → 60.54] Too late.
[60.78 → 61.04] Oh.
[82.04 → 83.88] He did it for you so you could chew.
[83.88 → 85.50] That was very considerate, Dan.
[85.86 → 86.40] Thanks, Dan.
[86.64 → 87.62] My mic was muted.
[87.74 → 88.30] That was for you.
[88.34 → 88.54] Oh.
[88.80 → 89.00] Oh.
[89.82 → 90.44] Okay, sorry.
[90.50 → 91.36] Who were the sponsors again?
[91.68 → 91.92] Squarespace.
[91.92 → 92.52] Back.
[92.52 → 92.96] Back.
[93.40 → 93.76] Blaze.
[93.92 → 94.32] Blaze.
[94.52 → 94.88] Fess.
[95.14 → 95.54] Fess.
[95.60 → 95.98] Fantastic.
[96.46 → 96.74] All right.
[96.80 → 97.44] Good job, everyone.
[98.14 → 101.08] Now, normally I would go right into the headline topic.
[101.18 → 105.80] We'd be talking about how Anchor is doing a no-no, but instead we're actually going to jump
[105.80 → 108.46] to the one that Luke ad-libbed at the end there.
[109.06 → 112.80] I don't normally do this because it kind of comes across cheesy to me, but I really want
[112.80 → 117.76] to thank you guys for tuning into the show because we all know that you would rather be
[117.76 → 119.50] playing Baldur's Gate 3 right now.
[119.58 → 121.04] Yeah, as far as the world can tell.
[121.04 → 126.96] And you set aside your time, and you tuned into the WAN show instead of playing Balder's
[126.96 → 127.80] Gate 3 right now.
[128.44 → 129.30] Or its second monitor.
[129.38 → 132.64] What percentage of you guys are playing it on a second monitor right now?
[132.70 → 133.88] Can we get a poll going?
[134.04 → 134.36] We can.
[134.48 → 135.16] I will do that.
[135.66 → 137.82] Because I assume that we're the primary monitor.
[138.26 → 139.28] Is that a fair assumption?
[139.52 → 141.08] Should those be the options for the poll?
[142.08 → 144.18] Primary monitor, secondary monitor, not playing?
[144.48 → 144.76] Yeah.
[144.88 → 145.08] Okay.
[145.26 → 145.50] Sure.
[146.28 → 150.86] I mean, you could have an option for Baldur's Gate is on their only monitor, but that really
[150.86 → 153.86] raises a lot of questions about how exactly they're responding to the poll.
[153.96 → 154.92] Through their phone?
[155.18 → 155.54] Oh.
[155.86 → 156.12] Oh.
[156.18 → 156.84] Yeah, through their phone.
[156.88 → 158.06] I mean, that is technically an option.
[158.06 → 162.74] Primary monitor, secondary monitor slash phone?
[163.86 → 164.34] Yeah.
[165.20 → 165.60] Uh.
[166.74 → 167.66] I believe in you.
[167.66 → 168.30] You got this.
[168.38 → 168.80] Uh.
[172.88 → 173.92] He's working on it.
[175.42 → 179.46] The WAN show is already a catastrophe this week, and we are like three minutes in.
[179.56 → 180.72] I absolutely love this.
[181.86 → 185.36] We were talking about it on the pre-show, and I was like, oh, this is a perfect conversation.
[185.52 → 186.80] We should, like, have this be a topic.
[186.94 → 187.10] Okay.
[187.30 → 187.54] Okay.
[187.54 → 187.86] Okay.
[187.94 → 188.24] We got a poll.
[188.24 → 192.06] And then Luke and Dan completely shut down and stopped talking about it, and I'm sitting
[192.06 → 192.84] here going, okay, great.
[192.86 → 193.20] No, no, no.
[193.20 → 193.38] Okay.
[193.46 → 194.38] I got some stuff.
[194.46 → 195.10] I got some stuff.
[195.42 → 202.68] The third gate of Balder has, at one point in time today, gotten over 520,000 concurrent players,
[202.86 → 204.06] which I find interesting.
[204.20 → 204.86] That is fantastic.
[204.86 → 206.62] Because it was midday on a Friday.
[206.84 → 207.52] No kidding.
[207.82 → 208.08] Yeah.
[208.08 → 209.24] What's going on?
[209.60 → 212.38] Where, where, how is everybody playing this game?
[212.62 → 212.88] Okay.
[213.02 → 217.44] That's the 11th highest concurrent player count in Steam history, and it was during the like,
[217.54 → 218.98] the work day for North America.
[219.04 → 220.02] Okay, but here's the thing, Luke.
[220.08 → 225.70] You know how we take, we always take Mondays instead of Fridays for stats?
[225.70 → 226.42] Oh.
[226.42 → 232.08] Have you ever gone to Costco on one of your, on one of your, like, days off that is not
[232.08 → 233.10] actually a stat?
[233.42 → 234.74] Like, on a Monday that's not a stat?
[234.74 → 235.62] It's, like, always still full.
[235.66 → 236.60] And it's full of people.
[236.66 → 237.52] It's very confusing.
[237.62 → 238.80] I don't understand it.
[238.80 → 238.96] Yeah.
[238.96 → 243.24] I'm walking around, I'm going, don't you people all have jobs?
[243.24 → 244.24] Like, it's a...
[244.24 → 245.44] I mean, I know I'm here.
[245.64 → 249.96] I do understand there's, like, uh, like, non-standard shift workers, night shift workers,
[250.08 → 251.40] or on-call workers, stuff like that.
[251.40 → 255.80] But I, I would always expect the population to be lower in areas like that, but it never
[255.80 → 257.12] really seems to be true.
[257.18 → 258.66] No, it's, it's, it's, it's popping.
[258.82 → 259.36] It's interesting.
[259.50 → 262.28] Like, you go, you go in on, like, a Wednesday morning.
[262.56 → 265.38] It's like, everybody's at Costco.
[266.04 → 267.96] That explains why there's no traffic.
[268.20 → 270.74] Because everybody's at Costco right now.
[270.80 → 271.02] Yeah.
[271.16 → 273.02] Filling up their gigantic parking lot.
[273.46 → 275.54] Eating all of their delicious samples.
[276.46 → 276.70] Yeah.
[277.74 → 279.42] Okay, back to Baller's Gate, though.
[279.42 → 285.16] According to this poll, 17% of people watching on Float plane right now are playing Baller's
[285.16 → 287.54] Gate, either on their primary monitor or their secondary monitor.
[287.54 → 288.16] That is wild.
[288.24 → 288.96] Have you played it yet?
[289.10 → 289.32] No.
[289.66 → 290.32] I've had no time.
[290.66 → 294.76] My, my, my labs people, who, some of them are actually watching the show live right now,
[294.80 → 295.74] have been here all week.
[296.20 → 296.92] So, no.
[297.16 → 297.74] I've had no time.
[297.86 → 300.88] Right, but it came out today midday anyway, so what difference does that make?
[300.88 → 301.78] I thought it came out yesterday.
[302.28 → 302.62] I don't know.
[302.62 → 303.48] Well, today is Friday.
[303.94 → 305.50] You said it came out midday on a Friday.
[305.68 → 307.98] Well, I knew the concurrent player, maybe it came out at midnight or something.
[307.98 → 309.58] I knew the concurrent players count was today.
[309.72 → 310.20] Yeah, okay.
[310.20 → 311.36] I didn't say it came out today.
[312.18 → 313.54] Have you played the series?
[314.12 → 315.62] The series, yes, for sure.
[315.84 → 320.56] But the last release of Baller's Gate was a very long time ago.
[320.62 → 321.22] Oh, I know, because Baller's Gate 2.
[321.22 → 323.48] I think we're talking like Xbox Original or something.
[323.62 → 324.36] Baller's Gate 2.
[324.42 → 328.22] Didn't Baller's Gate 2 come out before Never winter Nights 2?
[328.44 → 330.02] Or was Never winter Nights 2 first?
[330.30 → 331.82] I'm looking up Baller's Gate 2 right now.
[331.82 → 336.12] I remember being in high school and buying Never winter Nights 2.
[336.78 → 341.82] Baller's Gate 2, one of the expansions for it, came out in 2000.
[342.48 → 345.64] Baller's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition came out in 2013.
[346.08 → 346.28] Yeah.
[346.28 → 347.58] Oh, wait, that's not an expansion.
[347.78 → 349.16] That's just the title of it.
[349.64 → 353.82] Baller's Gate 2 Shadows of Ammon came out in, yeah, 2000.
[354.02 → 357.20] Okay, Never winter Nights 2 actually came out after I was in high school.
[357.20 → 359.38] So this would have been once I was into PC gaming.
[359.58 → 364.10] Baller's Gate 2 then came out before I was into PC gaming.
[364.34 → 364.44] Yeah.
[365.64 → 370.20] Like, I definitely played a bunch of Baller's Gate stuff, but like this was...
[370.98 → 371.70] You were a child.
[371.80 → 373.22] Old games, and I was a child.
[373.42 → 374.06] Yeah, for sure.
[374.18 → 374.42] Okay.
[374.62 → 374.80] Yeah.
[374.94 → 379.12] I have to confess, while I did manage to make a little, you know,
[379.56 → 383.28] Baller's Gate, Never winter Nights reference during the pre-show,
[383.50 → 386.42] I did not make it very far in Never winter Nights 2.
[386.42 → 388.78] I managed to get like a couple of hours in.
[388.90 → 389.56] It's heavy.
[389.76 → 391.60] I was a fan of...
[391.60 → 394.04] I played Never winter Nights 1 a lot, actually.
[395.00 → 396.90] But, I mean, I didn't really make it that far.
[397.06 → 399.38] I had more fun just like messing around in the game,
[399.52 → 401.26] because they're very just interesting games.
[401.50 → 403.96] Like, I remember figuring out in the original Never winter's Night
[403.96 → 405.24] that you could dupe gear.
[405.84 → 406.46] Okay, sure.
[406.54 → 408.60] Because you could export and import characters.
[409.30 → 411.80] So you'd have one game file, and you'd import a character,
[411.92 → 414.32] drop all their gear, delete them, import the character again,
[414.42 → 415.92] drop all their characters, delete them.
[415.92 → 419.16] And I'd like had more fun like doing weird garbage like that,
[419.24 → 420.88] like messing around with the engine all I could,
[421.44 → 423.28] than actually really progressing very far.
[423.38 → 425.18] Probably because it was hard, and I was bad.
[425.58 → 426.24] Yeah, yeah.
[426.32 → 427.54] They were hard games.
[427.60 → 428.60] Very unforgiving.
[428.78 → 431.16] Very true to D&D rules, which are ones...
[431.16 → 433.12] Which I have never gotten into,
[433.20 → 435.02] and never really understood very well.
[435.14 → 435.84] I had a hard time.
[435.92 → 437.28] Back then they did like...
[437.28 → 439.00] I don't remember the exact name of the mechanic,
[439.14 → 440.06] but like spell slots.
[440.06 → 442.42] So you could cast a certain spell like a certain amount of times,
[442.48 → 443.20] like per day.
[444.42 → 445.54] And stuff like that.
[445.80 → 447.02] So I would like...
[447.02 → 450.80] I'd have like a mage character and try to start a new play through
[450.80 → 452.76] and like immediately run through all my spells
[452.76 → 455.06] and be like, well, I guess I'll die.
[455.06 → 460.90] I didn't do a very good job of like, you know,
[461.02 → 462.54] rationing these out through the fights.
[462.66 → 464.48] Games were pretty unforgiving when we were kids.
[465.76 → 466.20] Yeah.
[466.84 → 472.12] Like I didn't really manage to get into that style of RPG
[472.12 → 473.06] until Dragon Age.
[473.16 → 474.60] Apparently it's still like that.
[474.68 → 476.90] So in Baldur's Gate 3, it works like that.
[476.96 → 477.36] Really?
[477.36 → 477.76] Yeah.
[478.66 → 483.26] I suspect that's not the easiest game to play
[483.26 → 484.46] if that's how the mechanic works.
[484.66 → 487.28] Because people are used to like mana, right?
[487.34 → 488.26] And you can regent it.
[488.52 → 490.44] And then honestly, in a lot of modern games,
[490.60 → 493.20] your mana is like practically infinite anyway.
[493.72 → 495.46] So you just free cast all the time.
[495.80 → 497.36] And it's more like, you know...
[497.88 → 498.44] Cooldowns.
[498.90 → 501.72] Cooldowns and using the right thing to counter
[501.72 → 503.10] the other thing that's going on
[503.10 → 506.42] than trying to like ration things
[506.42 → 507.54] and save stuff.
[507.76 → 507.84] Right.
[507.92 → 511.68] But I mean, there's certainly strong immersion arguments
[511.68 → 513.00] to be made for like,
[513.50 → 517.22] yo, no, you actually can't cast that spell anymore
[517.22 → 518.22] because you're tired.
[518.62 → 518.80] Yeah.
[519.36 → 521.58] So people are saying you have free slot cantrips,
[521.62 → 522.86] which can be cast infinitely.
[523.12 → 524.44] So you're like major spells
[524.44 → 525.68] are the ones that are going to be
[525.68 → 526.78] a certain amount of times per day or whatever.
[526.90 → 527.02] Yeah.
[527.12 → 527.52] It's interesting.
[527.66 → 529.28] People are asking if we've ever played D&D.
[529.34 → 529.68] Have you?
[530.58 → 532.20] I have played once.
[532.48 → 532.70] Oh.
[532.70 → 535.74] We did that one shot and then that was it.
[535.74 → 536.66] Right.
[536.84 → 537.04] Okay.
[537.12 → 537.56] That makes sense.
[537.68 → 537.74] Yeah.
[537.78 → 538.92] We did that with...
[538.92 → 541.54] Oh, what did they rebrand to?
[541.94 → 543.78] So they used to be a filthy lot.
[544.22 → 545.02] They rebranded from that?
[545.46 → 545.90] No.
[546.04 → 546.20] Yeah.
[546.30 → 547.32] It's not anymore.
[547.54 → 550.22] Their D&D show changed.
[550.76 → 551.12] I don't know.
[551.20 → 554.68] They've apparently had some struggles or something.
[554.96 → 557.16] Their old CEO isn't there anymore,
[557.30 → 559.14] but I don't think it was kind of like
[559.14 → 561.20] how our old CEO isn't here anymore.
[561.20 → 563.46] Like he's not there anymore.
[563.46 → 564.16] Quest keep?
[565.28 → 566.80] That doesn't even sound right.
[566.86 → 567.72] I don't even know.
[569.00 → 570.88] This one has uploads from...
[570.88 → 572.52] Has an upload from eight hours ago.
[572.80 → 573.16] Okay.
[574.38 → 574.86] Quest keep?
[574.86 → 576.12] It's active at the very least.
[576.26 → 576.42] Oh.
[576.68 → 577.98] It used to be called quest line.
[578.40 → 578.62] There.
[578.78 → 578.92] Yeah.
[579.06 → 580.26] But yeah, it must be that.
[580.50 → 580.78] Okay.
[581.06 → 582.36] Anyway, you know, I wish...
[582.36 → 583.46] So we did the one shot there.
[583.54 → 583.64] Yeah.
[583.68 → 584.60] We did a one shot there.
[584.70 → 586.76] That's the only time that I have ever played D&D.
[586.84 → 589.72] I meant to play the D&D football.
[589.82 → 590.50] Or no, that's Warhammer.
[590.62 → 591.16] That's not D&D.
[591.24 → 591.54] Never mind.
[591.64 → 591.76] Yeah.
[591.84 → 592.02] Nope.
[592.04 → 593.12] That's the only time I ever played D&D.
[593.12 → 593.34] Yeah.
[593.34 → 593.48] Yeah.
[593.48 → 593.66] Yeah.
[594.00 → 596.62] I played a bunch of D&D in like high school
[596.62 → 598.58] and a little dabbling after that,
[598.72 → 601.04] but mostly the most recent one that I've played
[601.04 → 602.14] and enjoyed a lot,
[602.24 → 604.20] actually significantly more than I enjoyed D&D
[604.20 → 605.86] is called Edge of the Empire.
[606.42 → 607.08] It's very cool.
[607.08 → 608.02] It's like a...
[608.02 → 609.24] It's Star Wars inspired.
[609.80 → 612.00] You're like scoundrels and bandits
[612.00 → 613.54] and whatnot from the outer rim.
[614.00 → 615.18] And what I really like about it
[615.18 → 616.56] is when you roll dice,
[616.76 → 618.90] it's not just like a pass or fail system.
[619.32 → 620.38] You know how in D&D it's like,
[620.48 → 621.82] okay, roll the hit,
[622.24 → 624.16] you go against the other person's armour class,
[624.22 → 625.72] and then if it's higher, you get it.
[625.94 → 627.80] Or you roll one, and then you just suck.
[628.14 → 629.12] Yeah, like something like that.
[629.14 → 629.68] Yeah, or something.
[629.88 → 631.16] In the Edge of the Empire one,
[631.24 → 632.92] there's like advantage and disadvantage.
[633.26 → 635.10] And the idea behind the whole system
[635.10 → 638.18] is like Han Solo doesn't miss.
[638.96 → 640.06] If he does miss,
[640.38 → 641.88] he's going to like miss the person
[641.88 → 643.76] but hit the control panel next to the door
[643.76 → 645.28] and that'll like open or close the door.
[645.28 → 648.32] Like if you do things,
[648.42 → 649.20] things will happen.
[649.30 → 650.44] You have like narrative dice,
[650.56 → 651.34] which is very cool.
[651.52 → 651.90] No, wait.
[652.00 → 653.34] I've heard of this before,
[653.54 → 653.92] but I...
[653.92 → 654.26] Edge of the Empire?
[654.34 → 655.34] Sorry, Edge of the...
[655.34 → 657.98] It's very likely I told you about it.
[658.00 → 660.46] Was it like a book thing or something?
[661.30 → 662.40] What is this?
[662.62 → 663.66] Star Wars Edge of the Empire.
[664.22 → 665.28] Whoa, why is this...
[666.74 → 667.86] Oh, you know what?
[667.92 → 670.34] I wonder if they reused certain elements.
[670.74 → 671.38] No, wait, what?
[671.60 → 672.72] Is there like an EU book
[672.72 → 674.04] named the same thing or something?
[675.04 → 677.56] I am so confused right now
[677.56 → 678.88] because I'm having a weird
[678.88 → 681.12] déjà vu moment or something like that.
[681.24 → 682.32] Maybe I did like a
[682.32 → 683.80] choose your own adventure book
[683.80 → 685.16] like as a child,
[685.28 → 686.04] like as a kid
[686.04 → 688.02] and it had like something like that in it
[688.02 → 688.36] or something.
[688.46 → 689.08] Like you're just...
[689.08 → 689.18] Yeah.
[689.32 → 691.04] You're ringing a bell that doesn't...
[691.80 → 693.84] People are saying that happens in D&D too.
[694.00 → 694.90] I understand that,
[695.02 → 695.92] but in Edge of the Empire,
[695.92 → 697.50] it is a direct mechanic
[697.50 → 701.62] that is both GM and player controlled.
[701.62 → 703.52] Like the player has input
[703.52 → 705.08] on how these advantages
[705.08 → 706.34] and disadvantages go,
[706.50 → 708.26] which I think is super, super cool.
[708.32 → 710.70] It makes it very engaging
[710.70 → 712.36] and it makes the combat
[712.36 → 714.80] and even social engagements
[714.80 → 718.60] really, really just gripping, I find.
[718.68 → 719.90] Because like if you're having
[719.90 → 721.20] like a social engagement
[721.20 → 722.84] in Edge of the Empire,
[723.06 → 724.30] it is combat rolls.
[725.10 → 726.26] You're literally rolling
[726.26 → 727.28] like combat dice
[727.28 → 728.96] throughout the conversation
[728.96 → 729.64] and if you get like
[729.64 → 730.56] a ton of disadvantage,
[730.76 → 732.08] like maybe you say something weird
[732.08 → 732.62] and the other person
[732.62 → 733.38] doesn't like you anymore
[733.38 → 733.48] and something like that happens.
[733.48 → 734.10] No, you're driving me
[734.10 → 735.52] absolutely crazy right now
[735.52 → 736.76] and you can do like...
[736.76 → 738.68] And if you try to force influence someone,
[738.84 → 739.68] you can like...
[739.68 → 740.68] Okay, no, no, hold on.
[740.74 → 741.52] Is Edge of the Empire
[741.52 → 742.52] the only thing that does this?
[742.56 → 743.40] Because I've never heard
[743.40 → 744.54] of Edge of the Empire before.
[744.64 → 745.58] No, there's...
[745.58 → 746.84] Are there other Star Wars
[746.84 → 748.58] like games that have dice rolling?
[748.80 → 749.30] Because I...
[749.30 → 750.92] I'm pretty sure at the same time
[750.92 → 751.70] as Edge of the Empire,
[751.70 → 754.86] I think a few other ones came out.
[755.52 → 757.18] Oh man, this is...
[757.18 → 757.86] This is ringing...
[757.86 → 760.48] How long ago is this thing that you...
[760.48 → 762.66] I mean, I couldn't have been past...
[762.66 → 763.24] I don't even know
[763.24 → 764.62] if I was in high school yet.
[765.50 → 766.36] Like and I feel like
[766.36 → 767.68] it might have been book-based
[767.68 → 768.24] or something.
[768.40 → 770.20] Like you just play yourself
[770.20 → 770.86] or something.
[771.12 → 771.70] Oh, interesting.
[771.70 → 773.22] I actually don't know
[773.22 → 775.02] but this is like bothering me
[775.02 → 775.92] a lot right now.
[775.98 → 776.68] Is this a thing?
[776.82 → 777.44] Edge of the Empire
[777.44 → 778.66] is a lot newer than that
[778.66 → 779.98] but it might be based off
[779.98 → 781.20] some mechanics from something
[781.20 → 782.64] that you did a long time ago.
[783.38 → 783.96] People are like
[783.96 → 784.48] thinking of
[784.48 → 785.52] Knights of the Old Republic.
[785.78 → 786.86] I don't think so
[786.86 → 788.16] because I never played Kodok.
[788.78 → 789.10] Yeah.
[789.42 → 790.98] Star Wars D20 someone said?
[791.62 → 791.74] What?
[791.82 → 792.56] Because that's...
[792.56 → 793.26] This...
[793.26 → 794.62] Knights of the Old Republic
[794.62 → 796.30] doesn't use standard dice.
[796.56 → 797.84] It uses their own custom dice
[797.84 → 798.70] and I think it's super cool.
[799.02 → 800.58] You have advantage, disadvantage,
[801.18 → 802.52] triumph, despair
[802.52 → 805.14] and like more
[805.14 → 806.68] like number-based dice.
[807.34 → 807.82] If I remember correctly.
[807.82 → 809.08] This is bothering me
[809.08 → 810.88] so much.
[810.88 → 812.70] Star Wars D20 Saga Edition.
[813.72 → 816.12] Star Wars D20 Saga.
[816.14 → 816.48] Hold on.
[816.58 → 817.86] What is Star Wars...
[817.86 → 819.02] No, it's not D20 anything.
[819.20 → 820.68] I've never seen a D20 in my life
[820.68 → 822.08] before I was like an adult.
[822.42 → 824.18] I didn't know any D&D kids
[824.18 → 824.50] in high school.
[824.50 → 825.88] What about Star Wars Saga Edition?
[826.00 → 827.38] Star Wars The Role Playing Game.
[827.50 → 828.24] This might be it.
[829.34 → 829.86] Wait, no.
[829.98 → 830.32] Hold on.
[830.44 → 831.12] Star...
[831.12 → 831.88] Stop it.
[832.22 → 832.86] No, not this.
[834.02 → 835.96] What is Star Wars The Role Playing Game?
[835.96 → 836.86] It's a role-playing game
[836.86 → 837.72] set in the Star Wars universe
[837.72 → 838.54] written and published
[838.54 → 840.30] between 1987 and 1999.
[840.60 → 841.90] This is definitely the right time.
[843.04 → 844.10] It was slightly modified
[844.10 → 847.18] and re-released as D6 Space
[847.18 → 849.76] which used a generic space opera setting.
[850.72 → 851.58] Okay, what do you do?
[851.64 → 852.34] How does it work?
[853.68 → 854.42] Have I...
[854.42 → 856.18] Does this look familiar to me?
[856.26 → 856.80] I'm not...
[856.80 → 858.04] I'm actually not sure.
[858.16 → 859.36] This was so long ago.
[859.60 → 860.18] Guys, I know the one
[860.18 → 861.16] that I'm talking about
[861.16 → 863.30] is a Fantasy Flight Games
[863.30 → 863.96] tabletop game.
[863.96 → 865.16] I know that 100%.
[865.16 → 866.08] It's called Edge of the Empire.
[866.26 → 868.20] I'm 100% aware of that.
[868.30 → 868.96] We're trying to figure out
[868.96 → 871.56] which one Linus is talking about.
[872.86 → 873.98] Five game books.
[874.94 → 875.58] Oh, man.
[875.72 → 876.76] I don't even know.
[876.84 → 877.92] Someone in Flow Plane chat...
[877.92 → 878.80] I don't know how to say your name.
[878.86 → 878.98] Sorry.
[879.14 → 880.36] K.W. Grief 2
[880.36 → 881.24] said the last time
[881.24 → 881.92] they talked about D&D
[881.92 → 882.36] on WAN Show.
[882.44 → 883.00] Luke talked about this.
[883.16 → 883.94] I try to bring up
[883.94 → 884.54] Edge of the Empire
[884.54 → 885.76] like every time
[885.76 → 887.26] D&D comes up in conversation
[887.26 → 888.74] because I think it's just such
[888.74 → 891.24] an incredibly fantastic system
[891.24 → 892.64] and I don't think
[892.64 → 893.36] a ton of people
[893.36 → 894.58] have been exposed to it
[894.58 → 895.72] and it's really,
[896.06 → 897.36] perfect.
[898.32 → 899.26] I just...
[899.26 → 899.66] I don't know.
[899.74 → 900.74] I think it's really fantastic.
[900.86 → 901.96] I think it's also very good
[901.96 → 903.28] for getting people
[903.28 → 904.70] that might not be so into
[904.70 → 906.28] the storytelling
[906.28 → 907.86] of tabletop role-playing games.
[907.94 → 908.78] Like if you play with someone
[908.78 → 910.10] and all they ever want to do
[910.10 → 910.52] is combat
[910.52 → 911.26] and just roll dice
[911.26 → 912.34] and have fun playing
[912.34 → 913.12] the RNG game,
[913.52 → 914.72] you're going to get them
[914.72 → 915.68] more out of their shells,
[915.86 → 916.70] including myself.
[916.86 → 918.16] I feel that way fairly often.
[918.48 → 919.04] You're going to get them
[919.04 → 920.34] more out of their shells
[920.34 → 921.34] by playing this type of game
[921.34 → 922.56] because you're like
[922.56 → 923.94] forcing creativity
[923.94 → 924.66] because you're going like,
[924.76 → 924.94] okay,
[925.02 → 926.22] you have a bunch of advantage
[926.22 → 926.92] on this role
[926.92 → 929.06] but you missed
[929.06 → 931.78] and if you don't do anything,
[931.78 → 932.56] it's very likely
[932.56 → 933.36] that this guy's going to
[933.36 → 934.10] kill you next turn
[934.10 → 934.90] so you need to use
[934.90 → 936.02] this advantage that you have
[936.02 → 936.68] to try to like
[936.68 → 939.02] create an escape for yourself
[939.02 → 940.78] or defeat this enemy
[940.78 → 942.22] in some indirect way,
[942.56 → 943.26] something like that.
[943.34 → 944.22] I just think that's
[944.22 → 945.14] super, super cool.
[945.14 → 948.18] So it makes it for
[948.18 → 949.54] very dynamic,
[949.94 → 950.76] very interesting,
[950.96 → 951.92] very story driven
[951.92 → 954.26] but like role heavy
[954.26 → 956.58] and high player engagement gameplay
[956.58 → 958.88] which I think is just fantastic.
[960.00 → 961.20] Yeah, someone said it's fun.
[961.30 → 963.28] The players get to contribute
[963.28 → 964.44] a lot to the narrative.
[964.66 → 965.06] Exactly.
[965.70 → 967.52] Okay, here's my problem though.
[968.22 → 970.68] I don't think I played with anyone.
[970.68 → 973.36] Yeah, I don't,
[973.48 → 974.64] that I don't,
[974.64 → 975.82] I don't fully understand.
[976.72 → 976.82] I don't,
[976.82 → 977.92] I don't either.
[978.58 → 979.54] But I'm like,
[979.66 → 981.00] I'm like sure
[981.00 → 983.28] that I did something
[983.28 → 984.10] at some point
[984.10 → 985.52] where I would try
[985.52 → 986.82] to force influence someone
[986.82 → 988.00] and I had to roll dice
[988.00 → 989.26] and if I failed,
[989.36 → 989.96] it was bad.
[991.16 → 992.90] Does Star Wars Saga Edition
[992.90 → 993.94] ring any bells?
[994.76 → 995.76] I don't know.
[996.88 → 997.62] I don't know.
[997.70 → 998.14] What is this?
[998.20 → 999.06] Star Wars Missions
[999.06 → 1000.86] is a simple solitaire adventure game.
[1001.48 → 1002.50] Solitaire adventure game?
[1002.54 → 1004.34] Each mission is a 74-page book,
[1004.60 → 1005.18] start of a story,
[1005.28 → 1005.86] mission briefing
[1005.86 → 1007.22] and the rest of the story.
[1007.34 → 1008.50] I have to choose character cards,
[1008.58 → 1009.40] specified number of weapons
[1009.40 → 1010.26] and ability cards.
[1010.74 → 1011.80] We'll be required to use
[1011.80 → 1012.08] a weapon,
[1012.18 → 1012.44] a vehicle,
[1012.50 → 1012.94] and our ability
[1012.94 → 1013.84] to check against the skill.
[1013.90 → 1014.78] Oh, this might be it.
[1015.48 → 1016.52] What is this called again?
[1016.56 → 1016.72] Sorry?
[1016.90 → 1018.74] It's called Star Wars Missions.
[1018.94 → 1019.84] Star Wars Missions.
[1022.06 → 1022.62] Does that,
[1022.96 → 1023.66] does those look right?
[1023.78 → 1024.42] I don't know.
[1024.42 → 1029.70] I just don't know.
[1029.90 → 1030.52] It doesn't seem like
[1030.52 → 1031.30] people liked it.
[1031.36 → 1032.34] It's very lowly rated.
[1034.12 → 1034.74] I mean,
[1034.76 → 1035.54] I was a kid,
[1035.60 → 1035.82] right?
[1035.98 → 1036.14] Like,
[1036.34 → 1036.60] I mean,
[1036.64 → 1037.62] and it's Star Wars content.
[1037.76 → 1037.94] Yeah.
[1037.94 → 1038.76] It was just like,
[1039.04 → 1039.32] interesting.
[1039.54 → 1039.76] And I was,
[1039.82 → 1041.06] I was super into,
[1041.42 → 1041.62] like,
[1041.68 → 1042.42] I was super,
[1042.64 → 1043.50] super into Star Wars.
[1043.72 → 1045.00] Click on the second last image.
[1046.16 → 1047.52] The tin doesn't look familiar.
[1047.70 → 1047.86] No?
[1048.00 → 1048.24] Okay.
[1048.96 → 1049.50] I don't know,
[1049.58 → 1050.90] but just because it doesn't look familiar,
[1051.02 → 1054.14] like my aunt was such a garage sale lady.
[1054.42 → 1054.70] Right.
[1054.82 → 1054.96] Right.
[1055.02 → 1055.34] Like she,
[1055.48 → 1056.06] I could,
[1056.10 → 1057.74] I might've owned it with only like,
[1058.42 → 1059.78] part of stuff or something.
[1060.18 → 1060.32] Yeah.
[1060.42 → 1060.76] Oh,
[1060.82 → 1061.28] you know what?
[1061.32 → 1061.48] No,
[1061.56 → 1062.08] it has,
[1062.24 → 1062.58] um,
[1063.10 → 1065.70] it definitely had multiple D sixes.
[1066.04 → 1066.82] This is never,
[1066.96 → 1069.48] this is not a thing I had encountered as a small child.
[1069.60 → 1070.24] Then again,
[1070.34 → 1070.94] like I said,
[1071.18 → 1072.86] my aunt was a very garage sale lady.
[1072.86 → 1073.98] She may have just like,
[1073.98 → 1075.46] gotten different dice.
[1075.46 → 1076.48] It doesn't have a D eight.
[1076.66 → 1076.94] Well,
[1077.06 → 1077.42] you're,
[1077.52 → 1078.70] or D 12 or whatever that was.
[1078.78 → 1079.44] You're playing with,
[1079.50 → 1080.94] you're playing with D sixes kid.
[1081.14 → 1082.22] You're just going to have a harder campaign.
[1082.30 → 1083.28] It's advanced difficulty.
[1083.28 → 1084.42] It's a feature.
[1084.60 → 1085.40] It's not a bug.
[1086.18 → 1087.38] It's just what it is.
[1087.96 → 1090.12] Feel like that was a scholastic book fair pickup.
[1090.24 → 1090.38] Yeah.
[1090.42 → 1090.62] That,
[1090.68 → 1091.46] that could be a thing anyway.
[1091.56 → 1091.74] Okay.
[1091.74 → 1092.24] I don't want to,
[1092.32 → 1094.16] I don't want to talk about this too much more.
[1094.50 → 1094.94] Uh,
[1095.02 → 1095.14] I,
[1095.30 → 1095.54] I,
[1095.64 → 1098.58] this is like driving me very crazy now though.
[1098.58 → 1099.04] Cause like,
[1099.06 → 1103.78] I have like these little snippets of memory from when I was like eight or nine,
[1104.48 → 1104.92] 10,
[1105.04 → 1105.42] maybe.
[1105.42 → 1106.36] And it's like,
[1106.42 → 1106.74] uh,
[1106.74 → 1108.24] like I tried to,
[1108.38 → 1109.60] I definitely tried to like,
[1110.02 → 1112.42] I don't think you play as characters you recognize.
[1112.54 → 1115.58] I think you're like a nobody, and you like level up and stuff.
[1115.76 → 1117.16] That's exactly how edge of the empire works.
[1117.24 → 1117.40] Yeah.
[1117.66 → 1121.98] I feel like the designers must've been at least somewhat inspired by missions.
[1122.16 → 1122.40] Yeah.
[1122.40 → 1123.90] It's got to be something like that.
[1124.14 → 1124.32] Yeah.
[1124.32 → 1124.76] Anyway,
[1125.02 → 1125.98] back to bothers gate.
[1126.22 → 1126.42] Yeah.
[1126.50 → 1127.68] Hope you all are enjoying it.
[1127.76 → 1128.16] Absolutely.
[1128.48 → 1129.40] Fantastic launch,
[1129.52 → 1129.92] uh,
[1129.94 → 1132.44] breaking 11th highest concurrent player count on steam,
[1132.56 → 1133.24] uh,
[1133.24 → 1135.18] in all of its history for,
[1135.18 → 1135.86] uh,
[1136.32 → 1138.84] a single player slash co-op game is very cool.
[1139.10 → 1142.56] Like a lot of games that are going to hit that kind of player count is going to be like big,
[1142.56 → 1143.36] Matt,
[1143.40 → 1146.68] like not necessarily massively multiplayer in the way that MMOs are.
[1146.98 → 1147.42] Um,
[1147.42 → 1147.94] but big,
[1147.94 → 1148.16] like,
[1148.20 → 1148.38] you know,
[1148.44 → 1150.52] competitive things like apex I heard was,
[1150.60 → 1152.42] was one of the ones that they didn't quite beat out.
[1152.68 → 1153.08] Um,
[1153.08 → 1154.24] other things like that were like,
[1154.32 → 1155.46] tons of people can play.
[1155.54 → 1156.36] It's not story driven.
[1156.70 → 1156.84] Ada,
[1156.88 → 1157.04] Ada.
[1157.46 → 1161.52] Also there are games like apex that are ahead of it that are free to play.
[1161.90 → 1163.30] This is a purchase title.
[1163.76 → 1165.80] So big news,
[1165.92 → 1166.40] big news.
[1166.56 → 1169.16] There's been a few games that have been coming out recently that like,
[1169.50 → 1170.72] like Final Fantasy 16,
[1171.26 → 1172.82] seeing the reception of that.
[1172.82 → 1174.36] And then now seeing the reception of ball,
[1174.36 → 1174.76] there's gate.
[1174.76 → 1177.58] Like I had been in this state for a long time when I was like,
[1177.66 → 1177.80] wow,
[1177.88 → 1179.04] gaming's like dead dude.
[1179.54 → 1179.70] Yeah.
[1180.04 → 1181.04] But then it goes to show you,
[1181.12 → 1181.74] it's like cinema.
[1182.12 → 1182.94] All of a sudden,
[1183.10 → 1183.32] you know,
[1183.32 → 1187.70] you put some movies people actually want to watch like the Super Mario brothers movie,
[1187.84 → 1188.12] Barbie,
[1188.60 → 1189.16] Oppenheimer.
[1189.50 → 1189.88] And it's like,
[1189.92 → 1190.20] Oh no,
[1190.26 → 1191.14] the cinema's not dead.
[1191.24 → 1192.22] People want to go to the movies.
[1192.22 → 1196.94] You just released 600 Marvel movies in a row and people got a little tired of it eventually.
[1196.94 → 1197.50] Yeah.
[1197.66 → 1199.06] It did take a long time.
[1199.24 → 1199.48] It did.
[1200.34 → 1201.36] And honestly,
[1201.36 → 1204.44] I didn't even get tired of it until they started really sucking.
[1204.86 → 1211.36] Like some of those movies do not deserve even to have as good scores on rotten tomatoes or whatever as they do.
[1211.42 → 1213.20] The Eternals is garbage.
[1213.20 → 1218.84] It is just four hours of absolutely who cares.
[1219.08 → 1220.14] Like I can't,
[1220.14 → 1221.46] I just can't.
[1221.46 → 1221.68] Yeah.
[1222.20 → 1222.64] So,
[1222.72 → 1223.00] but yeah,
[1223.00 → 1224.50] I'm really happy to hear it.
[1224.50 → 1226.74] Because I had been doom and gloom and gaming for a while now.
[1226.74 → 1227.50] Um,
[1228.38 → 1229.02] and I mean,
[1229.10 → 1231.74] battle a bit coming out of like seemingly nowhere for me,
[1231.76 → 1234.72] at least I know they're in apparently in a play test for a super long time,
[1234.72 → 1235.78] but I wasn't aware of that.
[1236.12 → 1236.52] Um,
[1236.62 → 1238.60] Balder's gate three coming out and just killing it.
[1239.26 → 1241.82] I'm very hopeful for star field coming up soon.
[1241.96 → 1242.88] We'll see how that goes.
[1243.02 → 1243.82] It's just like,
[1243.82 → 1245.10] there are things going on.
[1245.16 → 1245.70] It feels,
[1245.80 → 1248.74] it feels okay actually for the kind of first time in a while,
[1248.74 → 1249.22] I think,
[1249.30 → 1250.48] but I don't know,
[1250.56 → 1251.48] but yeah,
[1251.48 → 1253.80] great launch moving on,
[1253.82 → 1254.12] I guess,
[1254.18 → 1254.78] new topic.
[1255.70 → 1257.08] I want to talk about your face.
[1257.60 → 1258.40] My face.
[1258.50 → 1258.80] Yeah,
[1258.80 → 1260.34] we could talk about my face.
[1260.76 → 1260.98] Yeah,
[1261.28 → 1262.02] I am.
[1262.08 → 1263.18] I'm pretty frustrated.
[1263.44 → 1263.92] We've,
[1264.00 → 1268.12] we've tried dealing with this in private, and it hasn't really gotten anywhere.
[1268.22 → 1271.00] So we're going public a while back.
[1271.04 → 1271.44] We,
[1271.44 → 1278.10] we broke up with anchor who had been a long time sponsor over a scandal where they were collecting user.
[1278.94 → 1279.42] Well,
[1279.44 → 1280.78] I shouldn't say collecting,
[1280.78 → 1281.44] uh,
[1281.44 → 1282.52] user video,
[1282.52 → 1285.32] but they certainly had user data handling.
[1285.64 → 1285.76] Yeah.
[1285.82 → 1289.76] They were mishandling user data through their Dufy sub brand of,
[1289.76 → 1290.38] uh,
[1290.38 → 1291.86] smart devices.
[1291.86 → 1299.78] So particularly security cameras were the ones that were found to be very vulnerable to having data accessed or stolen.
[1299.78 → 1300.98] And they,
[1301.14 → 1302.86] they explicitly said,
[1303.04 → 1303.30] yeah,
[1303.32 → 1304.66] we don't,
[1304.66 → 1305.20] we,
[1305.38 → 1305.60] we,
[1305.60 → 1306.30] we don't,
[1306.32 → 1306.74] um,
[1307.42 → 1309.20] none of this is accessible online.
[1309.20 → 1311.30] And then it definitely,
[1311.30 → 1312.62] it was accessible online.
[1312.62 → 1313.96] And instead of just coming out and saying,
[1313.96 → 1314.46] you know,
[1314.50 → 1314.62] Oh,
[1314.62 → 1314.92] sorry,
[1314.98 → 1315.94] that was an oversight.
[1316.30 → 1316.74] Um,
[1317.42 → 1317.84] you know,
[1317.84 → 1318.16] our,
[1318.26 → 1318.50] uh,
[1318.50 → 1318.90] we will,
[1319.04 → 1319.38] you know,
[1319.42 → 1320.98] we will stop doing that immediately.
[1320.98 → 1321.70] And,
[1321.70 → 1322.00] uh,
[1322.00 → 1323.06] here's how we're fixing it.
[1323.06 → 1323.54] They were like,
[1323.60 → 1323.80] um,
[1323.98 → 1324.32] um,
[1324.32 → 1324.88] no,
[1325.54 → 1325.98] no.
[1326.86 → 1327.94] But if we did,
[1328.14 → 1330.02] then it's because we had to.
[1330.30 → 1331.26] And if we had to,
[1331.30 → 1332.14] it's because it's your fault.
[1332.20 → 1332.84] Like they just,
[1333.34 → 1334.04] it was bad.
[1334.18 → 1335.32] It was terrible.
[1335.32 → 1335.64] So,
[1335.76 → 1336.62] so we cut them off.
[1337.00 → 1337.40] And,
[1337.58 → 1337.84] uh,
[1337.84 → 1343.88] what's really frustrating is that they don't appear to have gotten the memo,
[1343.88 → 1346.86] even though we've contacted them multiple times.
[1347.02 → 1349.76] So here's an X from Jubal.
[1349.92 → 1351.16] I'm sorry.
[1351.26 → 1352.38] I'm never going to get used to that.
[1352.64 → 1352.92] An X.
[1353.04 → 1353.50] Is that actually,
[1353.58 → 1354.58] it says tweet on it.
[1354.84 → 1356.04] I don't know.
[1356.12 → 1356.98] I don't know how anything works.
[1357.14 → 1357.62] Anyway,
[1358.14 → 1358.38] uh,
[1358.44 → 1361.62] here's me still on a product page for them.
[1361.62 → 1366.30] In spite of the fact that we have told them multiple times that this needs to not be here anymore.
[1366.94 → 1367.30] Uh,
[1367.32 → 1370.10] so that's pretty Sneezy to me,
[1370.20 → 1372.70] but Luke brought up a good point in the pre-show.
[1374.06 → 1375.96] If we endorsed it at some point,
[1375.96 → 1377.46] is that technically incorrect?
[1379.64 → 1380.04] Yeah,
[1380.24 → 1380.96] I don't,
[1381.02 → 1381.32] I mean,
[1381.32 → 1382.38] I don't technically know.
[1382.50 → 1387.92] I think if you're not endorsing it anymore, and you're specifically saying something that is different to what is set there,
[1387.96 → 1391.28] I think that's extremely misleading and not okay.
[1391.62 → 1392.44] I mean,
[1392.54 → 1393.98] but I don't know if it's like illegal.
[1394.34 → 1403.12] Obviously the way that I feel about it is that if there is no ongoing relationship, and we have unceremoniously dumped these guys for being Sneezy balls,
[1403.34 → 1407.02] that if they keep putting my face on their product pages,
[1407.02 → 1411.78] that is extremely misleading about the current state of the relationship.
[1411.78 → 1411.90] Oh,
[1411.90 → 1412.14] absolutely.
[1412.34 → 1415.44] Regardless of whether I ever said that something was good.
[1415.64 → 1415.80] Yeah.
[1415.96 → 1417.58] And there are exceptions to that.
[1417.58 → 1426.38] If I were to publish an editorial piece of content, and they were pulling a direct quote from that with the proper context,
[1426.38 → 1428.28] that's one thing.
[1428.70 → 1431.46] But I believe the quote that they've got in there.
[1431.56 → 1432.70] I haven't actually zoomed in on this.
[1432.80 → 1433.56] I don't know what it says.
[1433.74 → 1434.38] I can't have,
[1434.70 → 1436.96] it uses the latest gallium nitride technology.
[1437.02 → 1437.16] Yeah.
[1437.42 → 1437.64] No,
[1437.74 → 1439.84] the quote in there is from a sponsored video.
[1439.84 → 1442.72] So it's a completely different relationship.
[1443.00 → 1448.64] We never really covered their products editorially because we don't do reviews of wall warts.
[1448.64 → 1449.28] Battery banks.
[1449.28 → 1450.82] Or cables or battery banks.
[1450.82 → 1451.42] Um,
[1451.56 → 1452.80] it's just,
[1453.20 → 1453.46] yeah,
[1453.52 → 1453.64] they,
[1453.72 → 1456.26] they were a sponsor, and we did sponsor reads for them,
[1456.32 → 1457.08] but that's about it.
[1458.00 → 1462.28] So I'm extremely frustrated.
[1462.80 → 1463.20] Um,
[1463.32 → 1463.76] I have,
[1463.82 → 1468.74] I have formally withdrawn any consent that I gave them to use my image in this way.
[1469.30 → 1469.78] And,
[1469.90 → 1470.46] um,
[1470.60 → 1471.94] there you have it anchor.
[1472.56 → 1474.72] If you haven't managed to get our emails,
[1474.72 → 1477.96] which we know you have because you got our emails and said,
[1478.02 → 1478.80] you'll deal with it.
[1478.80 → 1480.80] It's time to stop.
[1480.94 → 1482.16] The time to stop is,
[1482.36 → 1482.48] well,
[1482.54 → 1485.06] the time to stop is months ago when we contacted you about this,
[1485.14 → 1485.56] but the
[1485.74 → 1489.44] especially time to stop is now you guys actually need to stop doing this.
[1491.56 → 1491.96] Um,
[1492.32 → 1492.72] to all the
[1492.76 → 1494.66] someone in flipping chat said anchor is a Chinese company.
[1494.76 → 1495.78] They don't have to listen to you.
[1495.88 → 1496.02] Uh,
[1496.02 → 1497.72] this is an American website.
[1498.04 → 1498.32] Yeah.
[1498.88 → 1499.86] So yeah,
[1499.86 → 1502.12] there are actually are rules and,
[1502.20 → 1502.62] and no,
[1502.80 → 1503.38] you're right.
[1503.42 → 1504.84] They don't have to listen to me,
[1504.96 → 1506.22] but if they don't,
[1506.24 → 1508.78] that tells you an awful lot about the way that they conduct,
[1508.78 → 1510.84] their business, and you probably shouldn't shop with them.
[1510.84 → 1517.14] Like just because legally nobody can actually arrest them.
[1517.14 → 1518.18] If they,
[1518.38 → 1520.26] if they don't comply with this,
[1520.38 → 1521.48] they aren't,
[1521.48 → 1524.14] they aren't marketing honestly.
[1524.14 → 1528.42] And so that should tell you if they're not marketing honestly,
[1528.82 → 1532.38] especially if they have a track record now of not,
[1532.38 → 1532.80] uh,
[1532.80 → 1536.54] communicating honestly about how their products are handling user data.
[1536.88 → 1537.30] Um,
[1537.30 → 1537.78] they're starting,
[1537.90 → 1538.34] this is start,
[1538.42 → 1541.82] this is going from a thing that happened to a pattern.
[1542.46 → 1542.94] Um,
[1542.96 → 1543.18] they're,
[1543.24 → 1544.90] they're not operating their business with integrity.
[1544.90 → 1546.64] So yeah,
[1546.74 → 1548.74] guys stop now.
[1548.74 → 1552.80] Yeah,
[1552.82 → 1553.82] that's all I have to say about that.
[1553.82 → 1554.16] I think,
[1554.30 → 1554.42] Oh,
[1554.48 → 1558.00] we're supposed to explain merch messages and do two merch messages.
[1558.40 → 1558.76] Hey,
[1558.84 → 1559.60] why don't we mix it up?
[1559.70 → 1559.86] Luke,
[1559.90 → 1561.08] why don't you explain merch messages?
[1561.18 → 1561.26] Well,
[1561.26 → 1563.26] I figure out what the heck is going on with my YouTube dashboard.
[1563.74 → 1564.78] Merch message is a cool,
[1564.90 → 1565.10] neat,
[1565.10 → 1570.32] and super awesome feature in the LTT store where when we are live,
[1570.38 → 1572.46] if you add products to your cart,
[1572.80 → 1574.86] as if you're going to buy them and check out,
[1574.86 → 1576.76] when you go to the cart page,
[1576.76 → 1580.06] you can expand a little window and send a message to the show.
[1580.18 → 1583.10] That message will appear here down below us,
[1583.10 → 1584.50] and we will,
[1584.50 → 1584.98] uh,
[1584.98 → 1588.72] be able to read it in our dashboard and decide if it gets curated and thus,
[1588.72 → 1589.26] uh,
[1589.26 → 1593.56] verbally responded to on the show or if we give it a little text response and
[1593.56 → 1596.12] that will show up just like that one down below,
[1596.12 → 1597.50] or if it needs to,
[1597.66 → 1597.82] well,
[1598.00 → 1601.32] actually that's a perfect example that we will follow up with you soon means
[1601.32 → 1604.12] that it was sent forward to either,
[1604.12 → 1604.62] uh,
[1604.62 → 1606.94] create a warehouse support or another inbox internally.
[1607.06 → 1610.98] So we can follow up with it later on because it might be a question that,
[1611.10 → 1611.30] uh,
[1611.30 → 1613.44] the three of us don't necessarily have an answer to,
[1613.54 → 1614.66] but one of those people do.
[1614.80 → 1618.94] So feel free to use merch messages when you're checking out with cool products
[1618.94 → 1620.16] from LTT store today,
[1620.26 → 1625.38] like water bottles and screwdrivers and new shirts that are on the store.
[1625.64 → 1627.32] But I think we're going to talk about those later.
[1630.46 → 1632.48] Let's do a couple of merch messages in a moment,
[1632.48 → 1638.06] but first I want to get out ahead of one that seems like it's probably going to end up being a merch message tonight.
[1638.84 → 1638.98] Hmm.
[1638.98 → 1639.70] Yes,
[1639.70 → 1644.64] I have seen Linus Tech Tips fly me to the moon AI cover.
[1644.96 → 1645.10] Oh,
[1645.10 → 1646.38] I've been linked to this like a million times.
[1646.38 → 1646.64] Yeah.
[1646.76 → 1649.78] Why do people keep linking this to me?
[1649.94 → 1650.10] Uh,
[1650.10 → 1650.26] Oh,
[1650.36 → 1650.60] Dan,
[1650.74 → 1652.50] is there a way for us to play back audio today?
[1652.72 → 1653.04] Oh,
[1653.14 → 1653.28] yeah,
[1653.28 → 1653.52] yeah,
[1653.52 → 1653.70] yeah,
[1653.70 → 1653.86] yeah,
[1653.86 → 1653.92] yeah.
[1653.92 → 1654.30] One sec.
[1654.68 → 1654.94] Sorry.
[1655.46 → 1655.84] Uh,
[1655.84 → 1656.82] how does this have,
[1657.24 → 1659.88] how does this have a quarter million views?
[1659.98 → 1660.78] You're not sending me audio.
[1660.86 → 1661.18] I don't think.
[1661.32 → 1661.44] Oh,
[1661.50 → 1661.66] no,
[1661.70 → 1662.18] I'm not yet.
[1662.30 → 1662.40] Oh,
[1662.40 → 1662.86] there it is.
[1663.14 → 1663.30] Yep.
[1663.56 → 1663.86] Okay.
[1663.94 → 1664.46] Can they hear?
[1664.60 → 1665.58] They should be able to hear it.
[1665.90 → 1666.12] Okay.
[1666.16 → 1666.62] I can't,
[1666.68 → 1667.08] but that's fine.
[1667.08 → 1667.14] No,
[1667.26 → 1668.18] you don't get to hear.
[1668.18 → 1670.14] So a quarter million views on that.
[1670.22 → 1671.50] Does that mean Christmas album two?
[1674.36 → 1674.76] No,
[1674.86 → 1675.08] Luke,
[1675.16 → 1676.90] it doesn't mean Christmas album two.
[1678.26 → 1679.08] Are you sure?
[1680.08 → 1680.40] You know,
[1680.48 → 1682.14] Christmas album one sold pretty well,
[1682.22 → 1683.96] and now we have an actual store.
[1687.72 → 1690.40] The world does not need Christmas album two,
[1690.60 → 1692.64] but they're going to get it.
[1695.18 → 1695.84] I guess,
[1695.96 → 1696.18] you know,
[1696.26 → 1696.68] I actually,
[1697.06 → 1697.62] I'm sorry.
[1697.62 → 1699.22] I wasn't actually supposed to ask you that question.
[1699.40 → 1701.50] I'll make sure I ask the appropriate person next time.
[1701.58 → 1701.82] Sorry,
[1701.90 → 1703.58] what question were you not supposed to ask me?
[1703.72 → 1704.60] Christmas album two.
[1704.72 → 1704.90] No,
[1705.00 → 1705.54] there is no Christmas album two.
[1705.54 → 1706.58] It's a business decision,
[1706.68 → 1706.80] right?
[1706.86 → 1707.74] So I'll ask Taryn.
[1708.74 → 1709.68] I won't sing.
[1712.16 → 1713.92] We don't need you to sing anymore.
[1719.80 → 1720.74] Frickin' got him,
[1720.86 → 1721.08] dude.
[1721.80 → 1722.48] All right.
[1722.74 → 1723.14] Okay.
[1723.60 → 1724.36] Three merch messages?
[1725.00 → 1725.26] Two,
[1725.38 → 1725.56] two,
[1725.68 → 1726.00] two.
[1726.00 → 1726.68] Two merch messages?
[1726.68 → 1727.12] Read the sign.
[1727.12 → 1727.46] Okay.
[1727.56 → 1728.22] I'm so sorry.
[1728.30 → 1728.72] That's okay.
[1728.78 → 1729.40] I forget too.
[1730.14 → 1731.22] Let's see here.
[1732.30 → 1732.46] Hey,
[1732.60 → 1733.86] Dan and the talent.
[1734.18 → 1738.72] I'm hoping to do a study in my master's program on standardization in the tech space.
[1739.08 → 1744.12] Do you guys have any nuggets of wisdom on why it fails or succeeds when attempted?
[1744.52 → 1744.92] Thanks.
[1744.92 → 1748.26] There's that XKCD comic.
[1748.26 → 1748.66] Yeah.
[1748.66 → 1749.18] Yeah.
[1749.18 → 1750.02] 14 standards.
[1750.10 → 1751.02] Something like that.
[1751.10 → 1752.10] And it's too many standards.
[1752.10 → 1753.84] I'm going to make one that unifies them all.
[1753.94 → 1756.28] There are now too many standards plus one.
[1756.48 → 1756.56] Yeah.
[1756.56 → 1757.68] So that's a big part of it.
[1757.68 → 1760.34] And another big part of it is how fast technology moves.
[1761.08 → 1761.40] I mean,
[1761.70 → 1764.36] humanity is awful in some ways,
[1764.48 → 1767.24] but it's also super amazing and inspiring in other ways.
[1767.38 → 1768.06] Incredibly innovative.
[1768.40 → 1768.62] Yeah.
[1768.78 → 1772.96] Innovation is one of the big ways that humanity is kind of the bee's knees.
[1773.12 → 1773.26] Right?
[1773.26 → 1775.20] So when you,
[1775.30 → 1775.68] when you,
[1775.80 → 1783.20] when you build a standard based on the technology you have today and all the future ideas that you can imagine at this moment,
[1784.12 → 1785.46] you're going to miss something.
[1785.56 → 1791.98] And there's going to be something new and cool that's going to come down the line or some new use case that you're going to try to develop for.
[1792.06 → 1793.58] A new innovation will come, and then you're going to,
[1793.82 → 1796.18] you're just ultimately going to need new standards.
[1797.12 → 1799.04] And there's also just the
[1799.14 → 1802.66] the fact that one size generally doesn't fiddle.
[1802.66 → 1802.92] I mean,
[1803.00 → 1811.80] I'd say a classic example of this that I've never quite been able to wrap my head around is why HDMI and DisplayPort have not merged at this point.
[1813.64 → 1820.16] But they each do have capabilities that the other does not.
[1820.76 → 1823.80] And I'll also say that sometimes it does work.
[1824.10 → 1825.34] It's not just doom and gloom.
[1825.34 → 1826.50] Like we've been kind of saying here,
[1826.56 → 1831.46] like look at some of the stuff that the EU has done with phones over the last little bit.
[1831.46 → 1833.16] Things are happening.
[1833.38 → 1833.82] For example,
[1833.94 → 1839.52] did you know that while DisplayPort can generation for generation generally carry more video bandwidth,
[1839.94 → 1841.92] it cannot carry Ethernet.
[1842.38 → 1844.34] Whereas HDMI can.
[1844.34 → 1850.50] But then HDMI's alt mode over USB type C did exist,
[1850.64 → 1852.04] but was basically abandoned.
[1853.04 → 1854.04] So it's just,
[1854.24 → 1856.52] okay,
[1856.94 → 1859.52] I guess we need two kinds of cables.
[1860.08 → 1860.48] Okay,
[1860.62 → 1860.92] fine.
[1861.18 → 1861.62] You know,
[1861.84 → 1862.08] right?
[1862.24 → 1865.18] Wouldn't it be nice if there was only one port on the back of the graphics card though?
[1865.90 → 1866.20] No,
[1866.28 → 1867.92] because I would want to plug in multiple monitors.
[1867.92 → 1869.20] Oh my.
[1870.00 → 1871.08] I understood you.
[1871.16 → 1871.34] Yes,
[1871.38 → 1872.24] it would be convenient.
[1872.56 → 1874.34] I am.
[1874.42 → 1880.72] I'm actually sorry that that USB-C output that NVIDIA did during the RTX 20 generation didn't take off.
[1881.28 → 1886.58] Especially now that we finally have a VR headset that exists that could actually use the bloody thing.
[1886.64 → 1887.38] The PSVR 2.
[1887.38 → 1887.78] By the way,
[1888.10 → 1894.20] I think that community project to make it PC compatible is making at least some progress.
[1894.32 → 1895.64] I've seen rumblings of it.
[1895.92 → 1899.28] But that would be freaking awesome if you could just plug your VR headset.
[1899.76 → 1900.70] Takes power,
[1900.84 → 1901.28] display,
[1901.60 → 1902.54] it carries audio,
[1902.72 → 1903.52] it does freak everything.
[1903.68 → 1904.56] Like USB-C.
[1904.80 → 1905.46] That'd be really nice.
[1905.52 → 1908.40] USB-C is that one standard to do everything.
[1909.26 → 1916.04] The problem is that even USB-C is not one standard to rule them all.
[1916.04 → 1922.06] Because there are so many different subsets of it based on what's necessary for the particular implementation.
[1922.28 → 1922.74] For example,
[1923.20 → 1927.72] you can have a USB-C port on a phone that only carries USB 2.0,
[1927.98 → 1930.74] does no DisplayPort alt mode.
[1931.06 → 1932.40] It can only accept like,
[1932.70 → 1932.98] you know,
[1933.18 → 1933.62] five,
[1933.74 → 1934.22] five,
[1934.40 → 1934.88] actually,
[1934.96 → 1937.42] I don't know how many USB-C ports can only do five,
[1937.52 → 1938.60] five volt two amp.
[1939.12 → 1939.60] Maybe.
[1940.16 → 1940.78] I don't know.
[1940.82 → 1943.04] Because pretty much every aspect of the standard is optional.
[1943.38 → 1944.86] Because if on that budget,
[1944.86 → 1945.36] you know,
[1945.36 → 1947.26] $120 smartphone,
[1947.60 → 1951.76] they had to implement the entire USB-C technology,
[1952.22 → 1954.10] like optional technology list,
[1954.66 → 1957.98] it wouldn't be a $120 smartphone anymore.
[1958.88 → 1960.62] And it's not always necessary.
[1960.78 → 1962.00] Like on a gaming mouse,
[1962.58 → 1965.82] do you need it to run at USB 3 speeds?
[1966.32 → 1966.58] Yeah.
[1966.58 → 1967.20] No,
[1967.20 → 1967.22] no,
[1967.22 → 1968.94] obviously not.
[1969.04 → 1972.22] So why are we adding all of this extra cost for nothing,
[1972.22 → 1974.64] for literally no benefit to the consumer whatsoever?
[1974.94 → 1975.84] So it's tough,
[1975.96 → 1976.14] right?
[1976.24 → 1976.48] Like,
[1976.52 → 1977.58] I don't have the answers.
[1977.58 → 1981.06] But you have a lot of people who think they have the answers,
[1981.24 → 1983.50] which is how standard to proliferate,
[1983.60 → 1986.20] the classic XKCD comic.
[1987.30 → 1987.58] All right,
[1987.62 → 1987.80] Dan,
[1987.84 → 1988.28] hit me again.
[1988.50 → 1988.78] Okay.
[1988.94 → 1989.80] Last one here.
[1990.66 → 1990.82] Hey,
[1991.04 → 1991.42] DLL,
[1991.60 → 1993.34] good afternoon from Australia.
[1993.90 → 1998.60] How important do you think a university education is getting into the IT industry?
[1998.60 → 2000.20] I am studying currently,
[2000.46 → 2004.24] but all my employed friends seem to be so far in life.
[2005.68 → 2006.16] Uh,
[2006.24 → 2006.44] yeah,
[2006.82 → 2007.90] it's not.
[2008.40 → 2009.94] And I've got two people here.
[2010.04 → 2010.98] One of them just shrugged.
[2011.14 → 2011.98] What does that one think?
[2013.66 → 2013.80] Well,
[2014.38 → 2015.04] yeah,
[2015.24 → 2015.62] we got it.
[2015.66 → 2017.34] We got one of these, and we got one of these.
[2017.60 → 2017.62] Yeah,
[2017.62 → 2019.44] it can kind of,
[2019.60 → 2023.28] it can replace potentially having experience,
[2023.44 → 2028.48] but the way that I've described it is if you can get a job without it,
[2028.60 → 2031.66] then you're getting paid to gain that experience.
[2032.40 → 2033.52] If you can't get it,
[2033.54 → 2034.12] if you're very,
[2034.20 → 2035.86] very much struggling to get a job without it,
[2035.88 → 2036.20] you know,
[2036.20 → 2037.62] this is the career path you want to go down,
[2037.68 → 2038.30] all that kind of stuff.
[2038.38 → 2041.10] You can essentially pay to get that leg up.
[2041.20 → 2045.62] A lot of positions will have like a four-year degree or four years of experience.
[2045.62 → 2047.14] That's something I've posted a bunch of times.
[2047.14 → 2048.54] So you can kind of skip that bit.
[2048.96 → 2049.36] Um,
[2049.36 → 2049.88] but I mean,
[2049.88 → 2051.50] if you can get into the industry without it,
[2051.50 → 2052.48] then yeah,
[2052.64 → 2053.06] there might,
[2053.26 → 2054.72] there might be gaps in your background.
[2054.88 → 2055.92] Like for example,
[2055.92 → 2056.28] it's,
[2056.34 → 2058.58] it's always hilarious to me when I talk to the industry,
[2058.58 → 2065.82] talk business with someone who has formal schooling because they'll use acronyms and terminology that I'm like,
[2065.94 → 2067.22] yeah,
[2067.24 → 2069.04] I have no idea what the f**k you're talking about right now,
[2069.14 → 2071.86] but if you could speak in plain words,
[2072.02 → 2075.40] I probably understand the concepts, and then they'll explain what they're talking about.
[2075.46 → 2075.60] I'm like,
[2075.64 → 2075.94] Oh yeah,
[2075.94 → 2076.08] yeah,
[2076.08 → 2076.24] yeah,
[2076.24 → 2076.46] that.
[2076.58 → 2076.68] Yeah,
[2076.68 → 2076.90] sure.
[2077.14 → 2077.46] Yeah,
[2077.54 → 2077.96] exactly.
[2078.38 → 2078.74] Like I,
[2079.12 → 2079.54] because I,
[2079.68 → 2081.24] it was all school of hard knocks for me.
[2081.32 → 2086.38] I didn't study any business either in high school or in my couple of years that I lasted in university.
[2086.38 → 2086.88] Yeah.
[2086.88 → 2087.22] Yeah.
[2087.30 → 2088.06] And so you'll,
[2088.06 → 2090.12] you'll definitely run into situations like that.
[2090.12 → 2093.06] And there have been times when the
[2093.12 → 2097.20] when the kinds of things that you learn in school,
[2097.20 → 2098.74] like I'm just talking to like my life,
[2098.74 → 2099.14] um,
[2099.14 → 2100.14] my family's life,
[2100.14 → 2105.44] when the kinds of things that you learn in school are things that you may not have encountered outside of school.
[2105.44 → 2107.42] And that made you a more well-rounded person.
[2107.42 → 2109.92] Like my stupid sports psychology,
[2109.92 → 2120.58] like 100 level course that I took in university changed my outlook and my approach to a lot of things in life that I just wouldn't have thought of.
[2120.82 → 2121.26] Physics for me.
[2121.40 → 2121.60] Yeah.
[2121.72 → 2122.00] If I,
[2122.00 → 2122.86] if I hadn't done it,
[2122.86 → 2123.40] like it's,
[2123.48 → 2125.46] and I write like why sports psychology?
[2125.46 → 2127.44] It was like the psychology of competing.
[2127.82 → 2128.26] Oh,
[2128.30 → 2128.52] okay.
[2128.66 → 2129.06] Essentially.
[2129.06 → 2129.38] Yeah.
[2129.38 → 2129.50] Yeah.
[2129.62 → 2130.02] And,
[2130.10 → 2130.92] and so we,
[2130.92 → 2132.64] we talked about a lot of basic stuff,
[2132.64 → 2132.98] like just,
[2133.08 → 2133.32] you know,
[2133.32 → 2134.92] how behavioural conditioning works.
[2134.92 → 2135.22] And it's,
[2135.28 → 2143.22] it's really changed the way that I parent because intuitively you would think that if someone does something bad,
[2143.22 → 2145.40] the most effective thing to do is to,
[2145.40 → 2146.12] uh,
[2146.14 → 2146.36] you know,
[2146.36 → 2147.52] tell them no or whatever,
[2147.52 → 2149.86] but that's just completely not how it works.
[2149.86 → 2153.76] What you need to do is you need to reward them without bribing,
[2153.92 → 2155.70] never promise a reward ahead of time,
[2155.70 → 2158.92] only just wait patiently for the right behaviour and reward it.
[2158.98 → 2162.76] But not every time the least effective is no rewards.
[2163.00 → 2166.80] The second least effective is rewards every time.
[2166.96 → 2170.70] And the most effective is a reward once in a while.
[2170.82 → 2174.20] So if my kids do something they're supposed to do once in a while,
[2174.20 → 2174.58] I'm like,
[2174.66 → 2175.48] great job.
[2175.50 → 2176.48] Let's all have ice cream.
[2177.00 → 2177.80] And they're like,
[2177.90 → 2178.46] yay.
[2179.86 → 2183.22] I've seen people comment on our videos that you can tell from,
[2183.38 → 2183.46] you know,
[2183.46 → 2186.48] the look in minus his kid's eyes that he's like a
[2186.48 → 2188.94] a really mean dad or something.
[2188.94 → 2189.48] And I'm like,
[2189.58 → 2192.28] you can tell from the comment you left,
[2192.34 → 2193.10] you're an idiot.
[2193.90 → 2196.72] Cause that's really not actually how that works.
[2197.08 → 2197.64] Got him.
[2197.70 → 2198.10] It's like,
[2198.30 → 2199.26] man,
[2199.38 → 2200.02] I don't know.
[2200.04 → 2200.36] It's just,
[2200.50 → 2200.92] and it's,
[2200.98 → 2201.28] it's a
[2201.32 → 2201.52] it's,
[2201.56 → 2202.26] it's just a weird thing.
[2202.28 → 2202.64] And like in,
[2202.72 → 2203.00] in,
[2203.12 → 2203.66] in high school,
[2203.66 → 2204.44] I,
[2204.60 → 2205.76] I took no free blocks.
[2205.76 → 2207.22] I took just anything.
[2207.22 → 2209.74] I would take anything that was available on that block,
[2209.74 → 2210.78] um,
[2210.78 → 2211.28] just to,
[2211.42 → 2212.52] just to be more well-rounded.
[2212.52 → 2213.26] And so there's,
[2213.34 → 2215.38] if I had made it through more school,
[2215.38 → 2217.10] would I be more rounded, or I think,
[2217.20 → 2217.34] yeah,
[2217.42 → 2217.70] probably,
[2217.78 → 2218.88] probably maybe,
[2219.00 → 2219.68] maybe not.
[2220.24 → 2220.58] Yeah.
[2220.80 → 2221.52] Maybe not.
[2221.52 → 2221.72] Right.
[2221.72 → 2224.86] Because part of what school is supposed to do is it's supposed to help you
[2224.86 → 2225.54] learn to learn.
[2225.94 → 2229.18] And that's something that I didn't have a passion for at the time and no
[2229.18 → 2231.42] amount of doing it was going to make me want to do it.
[2231.42 → 2231.70] But,
[2231.80 → 2233.98] and then I learned it later when I had to.
[2234.44 → 2235.22] In saying all of this,
[2235.26 → 2237.86] we are talking about an IT degree to be very clear.
[2238.04 → 2240.02] If you want to go into like nuclear medicine,
[2240.02 → 2241.60] like you should probably go to school.
[2242.60 → 2243.30] Like there's,
[2243.30 → 2244.54] there are certain things.
[2244.62 → 2246.60] I want my dentist to have formal training.
[2246.60 → 2246.88] Yeah,
[2246.98 → 2247.18] yeah,
[2247.18 → 2247.46] yeah,
[2247.46 → 2247.68] yeah,
[2247.68 → 2247.86] yeah,
[2247.86 → 2248.06] yeah,
[2248.06 → 2248.50] exactly.
[2248.66 → 2248.96] Like there,
[2248.96 → 2250.06] there are certain things,
[2250.06 → 2250.66] uh,
[2250.66 → 2252.22] you should probably just go to school for that.
[2252.54 → 2252.96] Um,
[2252.96 → 2254.12] but with things like IT,
[2254.26 → 2256.90] especially if you can get your hands on some stuff, and you can do some
[2256.90 → 2257.86] home lab things,
[2257.86 → 2258.64] um,
[2258.64 → 2258.96] and you can,
[2259.04 → 2260.18] you can do some extra training.
[2260.18 → 2260.74] Like if you,
[2260.98 → 2262.96] if you get your foot in the door somewhere and they,
[2263.02 → 2264.62] they kind of like let you have a job,
[2264.62 → 2266.48] even though you don't have a lot of experience or,
[2266.48 → 2267.26] or education,
[2267.26 → 2268.30] um,
[2268.30 → 2272.40] and you're able to retain that job while spending time outside of work,
[2272.40 → 2273.58] like grinding on a home lab,
[2273.66 → 2274.26] learning things,
[2274.34 → 2274.78] learning things,
[2274.86 → 2275.30] learning things,
[2275.64 → 2276.08] uh,
[2276.12 → 2280.50] and then being able to step up and like treating that period where you're
[2280.50 → 2280.72] really,
[2280.80 → 2282.06] really early on in your experience,
[2282.06 → 2283.12] like you're in school.
[2283.36 → 2284.64] So like when you were in school,
[2284.64 → 2285.88] you'd be going home and studying.
[2286.00 → 2287.32] It's a very kind of similar thing.
[2287.32 → 2288.66] You're just being paid for it this time.
[2289.14 → 2289.50] Um,
[2289.50 → 2289.82] I,
[2289.86 → 2291.18] I think that can be very effective.
[2291.18 → 2293.02] So yeah,
[2293.50 → 2294.54] got a comment on flow plane.
[2294.62 → 2296.46] Dads are meant to be the mean ones.
[2296.56 → 2296.84] No,
[2296.94 → 2299.18] no mom and dad need to be aligned.
[2299.90 → 2304.14] They need to be a wall that the kids cannot put a wedge between.
[2304.48 → 2306.84] That is the most important thing.
[2306.92 → 2308.22] Neither needs to be mean.
[2308.32 → 2309.68] Neither needs to be the nice one.
[2309.68 → 2311.54] As soon as you've got a good guy and a bad guy,
[2311.64 → 2312.74] you have lost.
[2313.26 → 2318.00] The game is over because the thing about kids is they're just little adults
[2318.00 → 2319.62] and they are devious little f**chess.
[2319.62 → 2321.42] They will get you.
[2323.64 → 2324.12] All right.
[2324.14 → 2325.56] We're supposed to do some more topics now,
[2325.62 → 2325.78] I guess.
[2325.78 → 2325.90] Yeah.
[2325.92 → 2327.74] Someone in full plane chat said as an manager,
[2327.74 → 2329.52] one of the biggest things I look for is work ethic,
[2330.12 → 2331.64] wanting to learn and being a team player.
[2331.74 → 2333.04] School doesn't necessarily teach that.
[2333.38 → 2333.54] Yeah.
[2333.58 → 2333.98] So like,
[2334.02 → 2334.40] I don't know.
[2334.46 → 2335.34] And it's going to differ.
[2335.46 → 2337.12] You're going to run into the one person that's like,
[2337.16 → 2337.50] no,
[2338.02 → 2341.60] you must have exactly this precise amount of education.
[2341.60 → 2342.96] I don't care if it was 20 years ago,
[2342.96 → 2343.70] you must have it.
[2344.26 → 2344.62] Um,
[2344.62 → 2347.12] and other people are going to be like us and not care.
[2347.46 → 2347.66] So,
[2347.94 → 2348.18] yeah.
[2348.18 → 2351.08] All right.
[2351.50 → 2351.94] Uh,
[2351.98 → 2353.96] do we want to talk about,
[2354.20 → 2354.46] wait,
[2354.54 → 2356.34] what were some of our other headline topics?
[2357.34 → 2359.18] Do you want to talk about the
[2359.28 → 2359.58] uh,
[2360.06 → 2360.44] sure.
[2360.52 → 2360.72] Yeah.
[2360.80 → 2361.00] Yeah.
[2361.00 → 2363.28] Let's talk about Twitch expanding their gambling restrictions.
[2363.48 → 2363.90] Today.
[2363.98 → 2367.26] Twitch announced that it will be expanding its ban on gambling live streams,
[2367.26 → 2374.00] adding two more online casinos to its list of sites that are banned because they feature games of chance like slots or roulette,
[2374.00 → 2379.88] but aren't licensed as casinos quote in jurisdictions that provide sufficient consumer protection.
[2379.96 → 2383.10] Twitch claims that gambling viewership has dropped by about,
[2383.30 → 2387.32] by around 75% since it implemented its new restrictions last October,
[2387.32 → 2388.66] which was sports betting,
[2388.82 → 2389.54] fantasy sports,
[2389.68 → 2390.24] uh,
[2390.26 → 2390.46] sorry,
[2390.90 → 2391.48] sports betting,
[2391.72 → 2392.28] fantasy sports,
[2392.28 → 2394.78] and poker are still allowed.
[2394.78 → 2397.58] Twitch will also prohibit all streamers,
[2397.58 → 2398.18] uh,
[2398.18 → 2403.66] from sponsorship and promotions of gambling sites that take deposits in the form of CS go skins.
[2404.30 → 2407.10] This coincides with the result of a report from YouTuber,
[2407.46 → 2407.76] Oh,
[2407.76 → 2410.02] hound gown gun.
[2410.02 → 2410.38] Yeah.
[2411.78 → 2413.30] We did talk about this last week.
[2413.30 → 2415.24] We couldn't figure out the pronunciation then either.
[2415.44 → 2415.84] So yeah,
[2415.84 → 2417.10] that's the best I'm going to do.
[2417.22 → 2417.46] Sorry.
[2417.46 → 2417.68] Uh,
[2417.68 → 2422.02] that suggested that over 70% of CS go skin gamblers start before they are 18.
[2422.02 → 2425.96] And these online casinos are making little to no attempts to confirm the age of players.
[2426.32 → 2431.38] Approximately 75% of top CS go streamers on Twitch have taken sponsorships from,
[2431.54 → 2431.70] yeah,
[2432.54 → 2433.90] from CS go gambling sites.
[2433.90 → 2439.48] I suspect given the dollar values that we were talking about last WAN show,
[2439.58 → 2441.38] like 120 K a month or whatever it was,
[2441.40 → 2445.04] this is basically what's keeping the entire CS go streaming scene alive.
[2445.36 → 2448.00] Just that I suspect these are going to go undisclosed.
[2448.50 → 2449.18] Oh yeah.
[2449.94 → 2451.94] So like just saying,
[2452.06 → 2453.24] keep an eye out for it.
[2453.24 → 2453.70] Uh,
[2453.70 → 2458.24] valve sent a cease and desist letter to 23 of these sites back in 2016,
[2458.24 → 2459.38] uh,
[2459.38 → 2462.00] and has launched suits against many of them in the past,
[2462.00 → 2464.06] but skin gambling remains a popular,
[2464.64 → 2464.80] uh,
[2464.80 → 2465.48] remains popular.
[2465.48 → 2467.98] And five of that original list are still in operation.
[2468.54 → 2469.82] Gambling is also bannable,
[2469.94 → 2473.18] a bannable offence on steam as of May of this year.
[2473.90 → 2474.42] However,
[2475.56 → 2476.46] uh,
[2476.56 → 2484.90] Houndgownganya has criticized valve for the mechanical and aesthetic similarity between its loot box system and online slots.
[2485.02 → 2485.26] Yeah.
[2485.64 → 2486.86] It's the same,
[2487.04 → 2488.04] which is very valid.
[2488.16 → 2489.68] You got Spider-Man meme right here.
[2489.68 → 2495.06] Like it's many players treat this system in a manner reminiscent of a slot machine,
[2495.18 → 2502.28] caring more about the resale value of their jackpots rather than the in-game value of the item or how much they would personally care about it.
[2502.68 → 2504.28] Valve does indirectly profit.
[2504.28 → 2510.28] And you can tell because when people roll a knife, and they freak out before the knife even shows up,
[2510.32 → 2510.66] it's like,
[2510.82 → 2511.10] eh,
[2512.04 → 2513.16] because they're excited about the value.
[2513.70 → 2514.06] Um,
[2514.18 → 2514.36] Oh,
[2514.40 → 2514.72] is that,
[2514.80 → 2515.38] is that true?
[2515.46 → 2516.46] Are knives worth a lot?
[2516.64 → 2516.92] Oh yeah.
[2516.92 → 2519.10] Why are knives worth the most?
[2519.24 → 2519.66] I'm sorry.
[2519.80 → 2520.08] I'm just,
[2520.28 → 2521.16] just because it's rare.
[2521.96 → 2522.36] Okay.
[2522.36 → 2522.56] So,
[2522.66 → 2523.66] so knives are rare.
[2523.94 → 2529.62] Rare things are worth a lot in this context and knives are rare as far as my understanding goes.
[2529.94 → 2530.20] I see.
[2530.44 → 2531.36] I don't do any of this,
[2531.40 → 2532.24] so I could be wrong,
[2532.36 → 2533.74] but I'm pretty sure that's how it goes.
[2534.22 → 2534.60] Um,
[2535.18 → 2535.40] yeah.
[2535.74 → 2540.08] Valve does indirectly profit from how skin gambling increases the demand for these items.
[2540.08 → 2548.40] One admitted skin gambler looked back at his Steam history and found that he had spent over $21,000 on the platform,
[2548.56 → 2549.80] primarily on CSGO.
[2549.94 → 2553.06] He described this realization as frightening.
[2555.06 → 2555.66] I,
[2555.92 → 2556.76] I don't,
[2556.88 → 2557.48] how did,
[2557.80 → 2559.20] apparently Elijah,
[2559.72 → 2560.16] um,
[2560.16 → 2563.62] like our Elijah said that some sell for over a hundred K.
[2564.40 → 2566.52] I think he's talking about knives in CSGO.
[2566.62 → 2566.92] What?
[2566.92 → 2567.92] Is this in chat?
[2568.24 → 2568.44] Yeah.
[2569.04 → 2569.40] What?
[2569.86 → 2570.22] Yep.
[2570.80 → 2572.80] That's wild.
[2573.30 → 2575.42] I'm just going to Google most expensive CSGO knife.
[2576.62 → 2576.86] Oh,
[2577.00 → 2577.86] can we go to your laptop?
[2578.14 → 2578.48] Uh,
[2578.48 → 2578.80] sure.
[2579.16 → 2579.54] All right,
[2579.58 → 2579.80] cool.
[2579.86 → 2580.50] Let's go.
[2581.72 → 2583.60] The 10 most expensive knives.
[2583.66 → 2585.14] This is on Red Bull's website.
[2585.62 → 2586.54] What the heck?
[2586.78 → 2587.92] What happens if I reject him?
[2588.04 → 2588.20] Hey,
[2588.24 → 2588.54] get out of here.
[2588.58 → 2588.90] Nothing.
[2589.10 → 2589.38] Apparently.
[2589.60 → 2589.82] Cool.
[2592.96 → 2593.40] Okay.
[2594.20 → 2594.64] Okay.
[2596.14 → 2596.54] Features.
[2596.54 → 2598.34] Star Trek technology.
[2599.10 → 2601.50] The crap is Star Trek technology.
[2601.84 → 2602.20] Stat Trek.
[2602.36 → 2603.36] It shows on the
[2603.50 → 2604.06] on the
[2604.50 → 2605.76] I think for the knives,
[2605.88 → 2606.66] if I remember correctly,
[2606.76 → 2608.22] it like etches into the knife,
[2608.28 → 2609.90] how many kills you've gotten with it.
[2610.56 → 2610.94] Um,
[2610.98 → 2612.64] this says like $9,000.
[2613.12 → 2614.04] I don't think this is,
[2614.14 → 2614.32] uh,
[2615.32 → 2617.50] I don't think this is legit.
[2619.50 → 2620.20] I don't know.
[2620.20 → 2621.30] They get really expensive.
[2621.48 → 2622.32] I'll say that much.
[2622.32 → 2626.70] My brain hurts.
[2629.28 → 2629.68] Oh,
[2629.84 → 2631.40] I might've actually gotten real answers.
[2631.56 → 2631.88] Here we go.
[2631.94 → 2632.36] One second.
[2633.32 → 2635.02] Why are we all allowing this to happen?
[2636.24 → 2636.66] Wait,
[2636.70 → 2637.40] a million dollars?
[2637.68 → 2638.76] I think that's kind of the question.
[2638.92 → 2639.14] Oh,
[2639.14 → 2642.22] there's no way anyone spent a million dollars on a CS go knife.
[2642.22 → 2645.38] It says reported price.
[2645.38 → 2645.62] Yeah.
[2645.62 → 2646.16] There's no way.
[2646.84 → 2647.36] Yeah.
[2647.36 → 2649.36] Oh no.
[2650.32 → 2650.76] Uh,
[2650.76 → 2651.72] apparently it happened.
[2652.76 → 2653.20] What?
[2653.50 → 2657.08] Reports are that the rare knife's price came from own pixel,
[2657.26 → 2662.18] a famous CS go YouTuber and trader who apparently served as a middleman for the expensive transaction,
[2662.32 → 2664.22] which makes me think it was a pump,
[2664.52 → 2665.64] but I don't know.
[2665.72 → 2666.04] Right.
[2666.10 → 2666.40] Yeah.
[2667.40 → 2669.34] Look how much value there is in this thing,
[2669.44 → 2669.96] by the way,
[2670.04 → 2670.72] sponsored by site.
[2670.80 → 2671.26] Go do it here.
[2671.36 → 2671.52] Yeah,
[2671.52 → 2671.70] man.
[2671.76 → 2675.22] Have you seen the value of Jack Dorsey's first tweet?
[2675.68 → 2676.04] NFT.
[2676.24 → 2676.30] Oh,
[2676.32 → 2677.32] is it worth like a dollar?
[2677.48 → 2677.74] Hold on.
[2677.80 → 2678.06] Hold on.
[2678.08 → 2679.20] Let me see if I can find it.
[2679.50 → 2681.46] So Jack Dorsey's first tweet sold for,
[2681.54 → 2682.92] I think it was like 2.4 million.
[2683.46 → 2683.94] Um,
[2684.08 → 2684.32] okay.
[2684.38 → 2685.76] 2.9 million.
[2685.98 → 2686.30] Okay.
[2686.48 → 2686.70] Uh,
[2686.70 → 2689.42] now has a price of less than $2,000.
[2691.50 → 2693.06] That's a big yikes.
[2693.52 → 2694.58] Who would want it?
[2694.64 → 2694.74] Like,
[2694.80 → 2696.06] why does it even matter?
[2696.56 → 2697.72] Oh man.
[2697.92 → 2698.66] I don't know,
[2698.72 → 2698.96] dude.
[2699.50 → 2699.88] Rough.
[2700.46 → 2700.82] Yeah.
[2701.28 → 2701.74] Anyway,
[2701.80 → 2705.30] what do you think about Twitch expanding gambling restrictions?
[2705.44 → 2705.62] It's,
[2705.62 → 2707.10] it's weird to me because like the
[2707.10 → 2709.38] if this was like 10 years ago,
[2709.38 → 2710.40] I'd be like,
[2710.44 → 2710.74] Oh yeah,
[2710.74 → 2711.06] cool.
[2711.14 → 2711.38] Okay.
[2711.38 → 2711.40] Okay.
[2711.66 → 2712.58] But now like,
[2712.98 → 2713.78] Twitch is in trouble.
[2713.98 → 2716.16] Sports betting is advertised on the
[2716.16 → 2718.12] like sports channels.
[2718.38 → 2718.50] Yep.
[2718.50 → 2720.96] and like on all the surrounding boards.
[2721.00 → 2721.30] Like it's,
[2721.30 → 2722.12] it's everywhere.
[2722.32 → 2724.10] It's the right thing to do,
[2724.32 → 2730.36] but they're doing this at a time when kick is embracing gambling.
[2730.36 → 2733.08] And it's clear that there's a demand for this content.
[2733.08 → 2733.90] And I just,
[2734.78 → 2735.44] I,
[2735.50 → 2735.72] I,
[2735.82 → 2736.02] I,
[2736.02 → 2738.44] I don't really know what to say because on the one hand,
[2738.44 → 2738.78] it's like,
[2738.86 → 2739.06] yeah,
[2739.18 → 2739.34] yeah,
[2739.34 → 2741.40] we actually do need to stop.
[2741.40 → 2741.78] I,
[2741.92 → 2743.40] I personally appreciate it.
[2743.40 → 2743.76] We need,
[2743.82 → 2750.30] we need to stop grooming young people into becoming like whales for these kinds of microtransactions.
[2750.30 → 2750.66] Yeah.
[2750.96 → 2751.70] Turned into,
[2751.86 → 2754.80] turned into gambling that has become so prevalent in gaming.
[2754.80 → 2755.86] Um,
[2756.06 → 2758.36] apparently own pixel is quite against stuff like this.
[2758.42 → 2759.88] So maybe that was legit.
[2759.96 → 2760.38] I don't know.
[2760.44 → 2761.26] It sounds crazy.
[2762.24 → 2762.64] However,
[2762.92 → 2763.30] you know,
[2763.34 → 2763.74] it's,
[2763.84 → 2764.10] um,
[2764.42 → 2769.50] it's clear that they're going to be at a significant competitive disadvantage because of this.
[2769.50 → 2770.10] And I don't really,
[2770.76 → 2771.70] I,
[2772.12 → 2772.38] it,
[2772.46 → 2773.40] and it's not just,
[2773.48 → 2774.28] it's not just the
[2774.40 → 2775.60] up to the platforms to care,
[2775.64 → 2775.82] right?
[2775.82 → 2779.22] Like it's up to the creators, and it's up to the audience to care,
[2779.28 → 2779.44] right?
[2779.46 → 2784.56] Like everyone involved in this ecosystem has to sort of decide altogether,
[2784.56 → 2786.30] that something is not okay.
[2786.30 → 2788.50] And it's pretty clear that that's not going to happen.
[2788.60 → 2788.92] I mean,
[2789.36 → 2789.80] look at,
[2790.14 → 2792.04] look at something even as,
[2792.84 → 2794.96] okay,
[2795.06 → 2795.36] fine.
[2795.38 → 2796.38] We're going to wade into this.
[2796.38 → 2796.90] Uh,
[2796.90 → 2802.68] look at something even as black and white as the controversy right now over a React content
[2802.68 → 2804.40] that isn't reacted content,
[2804.40 → 2806.14] that isn't fair use,
[2806.14 → 2809.74] that just obviously isn't fair use.
[2809.82 → 2812.58] AFK from your computer while it autoplays kind of stuff,
[2812.66 → 2814.46] or just like eating and not even responding.
[2814.56 → 2821.48] And a big part of why it's blown up this week is dark Viper and X K X X K CD.
[2821.84 → 2822.12] Uh,
[2822.12 → 2823.82] X Q C are at it again.
[2823.92 → 2825.68] We knew dark Viper was going to be involved.
[2825.78 → 2825.92] Well,
[2825.98 → 2826.10] yeah,
[2826.10 → 2827.30] we knew he was going to be involved,
[2827.30 → 2827.98] but I,
[2828.04 → 2833.62] I'm surprised X Q C is getting baited into this because he's been pretty clear about
[2833.62 → 2834.44] his la,
[2834.52 → 2834.90] la,
[2834.90 → 2835.18] la,
[2835.26 → 2835.48] la,
[2835.48 → 2835.68] la,
[2835.84 → 2836.34] la,
[2836.34 → 2836.82] la,
[2836.82 → 2836.94] la,
[2836.94 → 2837.06] la,
[2837.06 → 2837.08] la,
[2837.08 → 2837.12] la,
[2837.12 → 2837.34] la,
[2837.34 → 2837.90] la,
[2837.90 → 2837.96] la,
[2837.96 → 2838.06] la,
[2838.06 → 2838.54] la,
[2838.54 → 2839.10] la,
[2839.10 → 2840.38] la,
[2840.38 → 2848.06] in the past, but he finally said the quiet part out loud earlier this week to the point where like,
[2848.44 → 2854.24] I, is this in the dark or? No, it's not. I, I read his tweet and my jaw just about hit my keyboard.
[2854.24 → 2860.92] I went, okay, if you're gonna, if you're gonna even pretend plausible deniability,
[2861.28 → 2865.38] I'm just a dumb guy. Uh, this is my persona. Like if you're even gonna, if you're even gonna play
[2865.38 → 2874.92] that game, you, you, you can't just blatantly say I do it because it makes money. Right? Because
[2874.92 → 2881.78] that's no one ever said it didn't. That wasn't anyone's point. Their point was that that's
[2881.78 → 2890.28] someone else's money. That was the point. And that's like broken on my computer. I'm trying
[2890.28 → 2895.32] to find these tweets, but I can't even use Twitter properly. So I don't know. And,
[2895.38 → 2902.86] and, and no, in fact, um, it is, it is not covered by fair use. And that is, that is pretty plain
[2902.86 → 2910.02] at some point, somebody is going to figure out that he just signed a hundred million dollar contract
[2910.02 → 2915.62] and come knocking. And I don't believe there's going to be any statute of limitations for this
[2915.62 → 2922.62] because it's never been dealt with at any point. Like if you, if you robbed someone 10 years ago,
[2922.62 → 2929.64] you're still culpable or five years ago, I mean, this is like, it's happening daily now.
[2930.98 → 2940.66] So, um, at some point someone's going to go, Hey, you know what? This is a pretty big bag that
[2940.66 → 2946.40] we can get over this, but I'm going to buy my time. I'm going to let him keep doing it.
[2946.40 → 2951.76] Well, let him build wealth. Hope he doesn't, you know, lose a bunch of it in another failed
[2951.76 → 2956.98] relationship or gambling. And I'm going to go after it. I'm going to get mine. Yeah.
[2957.70 → 2962.60] But then, I mean, I've been calling, I've been, I've been making doomsday predictions for, you know,
[2962.62 → 2968.70] years that haven't come true. I mean, where, where is the child YouTuber star apocalypse that I've been
[2968.70 → 2971.56] predicting that I've been calling for a long time ago. Yeah.
[2971.56 → 2976.74] I've been calling this for years. I'm looking at it go like all these family vlog channels out there and
[2976.74 → 2983.66] stuff. At what point is these kids going to go, Hey, yo, the millions of dollars that you guys made,
[2984.18 → 2989.74] putting a roof over my head is actually the basics. I need to be paid. Where is it? I,
[2989.88 → 2994.62] it still hasn't really happened. I don't know. Furthermore, I don't know, man. Furthermore, I don't know.
[2995.54 → 2999.36] Someone in China is asking, how do you guys plan to deal with the React channel? You were talking about a
[2999.36 → 3006.18] while ago. We just have it on ice. Um, you know, obviously our intention was to, to do it in a way
[3006.18 → 3014.38] that was, um, at, at worst neutral and that ideally beneficial to, you know, whoever or whatever it was
[3014.38 → 3020.52] that we were reacting to. But it's pretty clear that it's a minefield. And it's also pretty clear
[3020.52 → 3027.20] that we are other than the la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la crowd. Um, we're heading into people having,
[3027.20 → 3033.02] uh, I think a clearer understanding, or I shouldn't say a clearer understanding. We're headed into
[3033.02 → 3040.06] people having a more negative outlook on react content, regardless of whether it actually is
[3040.06 → 3046.80] fair use or isn't. And that's the thing is where that line is drawn is super complicated because
[3046.80 → 3053.98] fair use is not a law. Fair use is a set of guidelines. It's, it's pillars. It's an argument.
[3053.98 → 3059.96] It has to actually be litigated every time. And it hasn't really been tested that much in the
[3059.96 → 3067.80] digital streaming age. So we're all kind of waiting for what's going to be the next H3 versus or XQC
[3067.80 → 3073.86] versus, and we're kind of waiting for precedents to be set here. And it's happening really, really
[3073.86 → 3079.42] slowly, but looking at how the networks are struggling. If I'm them, and I'm sitting here going,
[3079.42 → 3084.10] oh yeah, you guys are watching, you know, Iron Chef or whatever on your stream, or you're watching
[3084.10 → 3090.46] stuff, or you're watching that, um, you know, I, if I'm looking for ways to supplement my income
[3090.46 → 3095.84] when I'm, when I'm struggling, I mean, it's, it just seems like such an obvious target.
[3095.84 → 3107.00] Yeah. I don't know, man. Good luck, everybody.
[3110.12 → 3110.60] Yeah.
[3111.66 → 3118.20] CR Sin Australia asks, so if I did a React video on the WAN show and gave my two cents every couple
[3118.20 → 3125.78] of minutes, who owns that content? Really challenging until we sue you sort of you do.
[3126.24 → 3132.40] Unless we file a copyright strike, in which case when you file your appeal of that copyright strike,
[3132.62 → 3139.08] actually, yeah, it's not sued you. Okay. So it's yours until we decide it isn't. We file a copyright
[3139.08 → 3146.42] strike, and then you have to defend your use of it in court. If you want to overrule that copyright
[3146.42 → 3150.98] strike, and you have to prove that it is in fact fair use. Now it usually doesn't make it that far.
[3151.10 → 3154.58] I think YouTube does act as an arbitrator in some of these cases.
[3154.58 → 3158.74] They'll sometimes just kick them out. But in more complicated ones, they will basically say,
[3158.86 → 3163.78] yeah, it's up to you to defend this in court. You actually need to, you need to make a fair use
[3163.78 → 3169.30] defence of your use of the content. Like this happened with a goat when he was doing his thing
[3169.30 → 3173.28] on that guy that's making that game fraudulently or whatever. I don't remember all the details,
[3173.36 → 3177.54] but he got strikes thrown against him and YouTube just threw them out because they were clearly
[3177.54 → 3184.40] garbage. Yes. So YouTube will do that, which is nice. Yeah. But yeah. So it really, it just depends
[3184.40 → 3190.14] on, because, because remember, remember what the pillars of fair use are, which I am just going to
[3190.14 → 3195.40] look up so that I don't get any of them wrong. So there's the purpose and character of the use.
[3195.82 → 3200.56] There's the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount or substantiality of the portion used,
[3200.56 → 3208.12] and the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work. It's not just a matter of
[3208.12 → 3213.88] like, well, if you get three out of four pillars, then it's definitely fair use. If one of the other
[3213.88 → 3219.28] pillars is really, really, really, terrible, then that can submarine your whole argument.
[3219.28 → 3228.52] So even if the purpose of the work is educational, for example, which would be much easier to justify
[3228.52 → 3233.66] than, you know, for profit commercial use of the work. Well, hold on a second. What if it's
[3233.66 → 3238.74] educational, but you are profiting from it? Well, hold on a second. Now it's getting somewhere into
[3238.74 → 3244.38] the grayer zone there. Okay. But what about the nature of the copyrighted work? If it was,
[3244.38 → 3252.88] you know, a selfie clip that someone took of them falling off their chair, that might be,
[3253.56 → 3260.36] that they just uploaded freely to some site. Well, the nature of that work means that your copyright
[3260.36 → 3266.28] for it is going to be a little bit harder to defend if somebody is reacting to it. You know,
[3266.28 → 3271.30] Guy Fall down, funny, you could argue that this reaction is transformative, especially if they were
[3271.30 → 3275.50] to do something like Guy Fall down, and then they reenact it or something like that. So that's where
[3275.50 → 3282.42] we get into the purpose and character of the use again. Sorry, I meant to get into the amount or
[3282.42 → 3287.82] substantiality. If they were to show only, you know, the very beginning and then show like where
[3287.82 → 3292.12] you end up flat on your face, well, then they haven't used the whole thing. And then that helps
[3292.12 → 3297.12] the argument that it was fair use. And then, well, that gets to number four, the effect on the
[3297.12 → 3302.20] potential market. If you're actually not showing enough that people can get the whole point and
[3302.20 → 3306.44] then not have to watch the original video, well, that helps a lot. So for example, something that
[3306.44 → 3313.76] we often do in our videos, if we're reviewing a TV, okay, we will often just have a movie,
[3314.14 → 3318.38] like a, like a real movie, just playing on the screen while we review the TV.
[3318.38 → 3327.28] Probably we will not get sued because the point or, and we will not get copyright struck because
[3327.28 → 3335.04] the purpose and character of the use is to demonstrate the features of a product on which
[3335.04 → 3341.14] that content may be enjoyed. The nature of the copyrighted work in this case is super copyrighted,
[3341.46 → 3345.52] super high production value. They've, boy, if they ever put a lot of resources into making this
[3345.52 → 3352.82] unique content, but that doesn't necessarily mean that ours is not fair use because factor three,
[3353.04 → 3360.44] we have used a very small amount of it and factor four, if anything, our effect on the potential
[3360.44 → 3367.50] market for the work goes up because of us creating more exposure on it, using it as an example of the
[3367.60 → 3373.86] the kind of great content that you can enjoy on this television. So probably no one would be stupid
[3373.86 → 3379.72] enough to sue us over that kind of thing. And if they did, I think we would have a very strong
[3379.72 → 3386.14] argument that this is fair use of this content because the, the, the nature of, of our use of it
[3386.14 → 3393.58] is purely like positive towards you. Now you might, let's say we were trying to use a movie as an example
[3393.58 → 3398.56] of bad HDR mastering and how that doesn't look good on this particular TV. Well, then they might get salty,
[3398.56 → 3406.92] but that's in the interest of educating the public about this product. But so our purpose is commercial,
[3406.92 → 3411.52] but it could be seen as commercial because we are making money on our production. So the whole thing
[3411.52 → 3420.06] gets very hairy, very quickly. What we know for sure, however, is that sitting and watching someone
[3420.06 → 3426.34] else's content while you shovel popcorn into your face, ain't it. And it's a matter of time.
[3426.34 → 3434.10] Yeah. I'm very surprised it hasn't really happened. Yeah, me too. But, but they also might just be,
[3434.16 → 3438.84] this might be tactical. They might just be like, all right, well, I'm a wait because a lot of the
[3438.84 → 3446.08] times you'll see this kind of lawsuit target every infraction, and they'll go for a much larger sum.
[3446.80 → 3452.74] Yeah. And what's really, what's terrible for these kinds of serial perpetrators
[3452.74 → 3458.80] is demonstrating any kind of self-awareness whatsoever, because as soon as it's clear
[3458.80 → 3462.42] that this has been brought to their attention and that they knew,
[3463.70 → 3471.48] I mean, you're just asking for it at that point. It's obvious you knew. So since you knew, and you did
[3471.48 → 3478.14] it anyway, well, it doesn't necessarily change a verdict. It doesn't change whether you're
[3478.14 → 3483.66] innocent or guilty, but what it does change is potential damages that might be awarded. If you
[3483.66 → 3490.12] were like, obviously knowingly, like you're not going to get leniency if you knew. And with the
[3490.22 → 3495.00] how viral this is going, I think it's going to be hard for any major streamer to go,
[3495.00 → 3502.38] oh, I didn't know. I didn't know. Yeah, you know, of course, you know, you know, that it's easier to
[3502.38 → 3507.18] make money by just putting someone else's content on the screen that they worked to create. Of course,
[3507.18 → 3517.42] that's easier. And if it's easy, well, it means someone else did the work, doesn't it? Yeah. So it's tough,
[3517.48 → 3524.84] right? Yeah, man. I don't know. And like with consent is totally different. Like I've explicitly,
[3524.84 → 3528.82] told Shroud, go ahead and watch my videos on stream. He's the only one who's ever asked.
[3530.64 → 3536.56] Marquez? No. Okay. That's different. I have not told Marquez, go ahead and watch my videos on
[3536.56 → 3541.72] stream. Marquez only streams the Waveform podcast, and he wouldn't sit and watch our videos on the
[3541.72 → 3547.52] Waveform podcast. So it hasn't really come up. But, but Shroud explicitly is a streamer who I know
[3547.52 → 3552.42] does watch our videos on stream. And I explicitly said, yeah, it's chill, dude. Go ahead.
[3552.42 → 3558.50] Whereas with Marquez, the agreement is more of like a trade. We are welcome to use clips from
[3558.50 → 3562.48] his videos with proper attribution. And he's welcome to use clips from our videos with proper
[3562.48 → 3566.72] attribution. Neither of us worries about emailing the other every time. But there's an agreement
[3566.72 → 3573.40] there. That's across licensing agreement doesn't need a fair use defence. It just is an agreement.
[3575.16 → 3579.98] Anyway, sorry. I talked about that for a lot longer than I expected to. Sorry. I know it's like
[3579.98 → 3584.00] boring for a lot of people. Oh, apparently it's not that boring. People are very tuned into this.
[3584.08 → 3589.72] Okay. Well, at any rate, good luck everyone with your, with your fair use drama. And meanwhile,
[3589.72 → 3594.08] we're just going to keep doing our thing, which involves actually hiring people and actually like
[3594.08 → 3598.08] paying them to write scripts and shoot videos and make real original content.
[3598.08 → 3604.32] Yeah. And it's really hard.
[3604.32 → 3605.70] And it's really hard.
[3608.10 → 3609.24] Yeah, it's really hard.
[3610.82 → 3614.82] Choco Kaiser asked, how about Mongol watching videos on stream? How about it?
[3615.04 → 3616.74] I don't think I've never given him permission.
[3616.88 → 3622.38] I don't think any of Linus's comments is about any particular streamer. We're talking about
[3622.38 → 3630.10] the nuances and complications of the space in general. Yep. But, but about that, I've never
[3630.10 → 3637.82] given him permission. But with that said, as a prominent creator, it doesn't really affect me that
[3637.82 → 3644.60] much, not in a meaningful way. So if, you know, Mongol or Moist Critical or whatever were to just,
[3644.60 → 3650.54] and to be clear, some are better than others. The more commentary and the less of the original
[3650.54 → 3655.30] content you use, well, the more transformative it is and the less of the original content you used
[3655.30 → 3659.62] and the, the more of a positive effect you're having on the market for the original content,
[3659.72 → 3666.98] right? So not all of them are equal in this regard and not all of them are consistent in this regard.
[3667.12 → 3672.72] Some of them will do a perfect job sometimes and a really not very good job other times.
[3673.16 → 3678.74] However, for my part, we've never gone after anybody for it because of reasons that are actually
[3678.74 → 3684.04] nothing to do with fair use. One, I don't need the money that bad. If someone gets a million views
[3684.04 → 3689.84] watching my video on stream or whatever, it's not like I'm not going to eat this month. I'm not a
[3689.84 → 3695.32] small creator anymore. So it's, it's, it's like, yeah, obviously I wouldn't mind the couple grand,
[3695.42 → 3699.80] right? Like I could, I could, I can pay for stuff around here with that, but I'm also going to be okay.
[3699.96 → 3704.98] But there was no major utility in going after like every single person that reacted to like the hard
[3704.98 → 3710.10] thing or good gravy. No, no. And it honestly just would have taken a lot of time. The other thing
[3710.10 → 3716.68] too, is that I have to consider sort of my own brand image in all of this, right? Like I'm,
[3717.32 → 3722.78] what do I, do I, do I want to become that guy in the community that like goes after everybody for
[3722.78 → 3730.86] using his clips? A lot of people legitimately do not understand fair use and think that streamers
[3730.86 → 3736.08] using these clips is totally legit and above board. And they're just, I don't know how to explain it
[3736.08 → 3741.44] other than, well, they've never looked into it, or they're dumb, or they just have like a super
[3741.44 → 3745.84] close par asocial relationship with their favourite streamers and couldn't imagine them doing anything
[3745.84 → 3751.86] wrong or like, you know, whatever it is, right? Like it's, they're wrong, but they're confidently wrong,
[3752.04 → 3756.06] which is a which is a scary, dangerous kind of wrong. Right. And I don't, I don't need to create
[3756.06 → 3762.10] that kind of drama where I'm, where I'm like going after people legitimately enforcing my own
[3762.10 → 3767.78] copyright only to have the community turn around and like get mad at me. Like I'm the bad guy for
[3767.78 → 3773.04] doing what is legally well within my rights for the content I've worked hard and spent a lot of
[3773.04 → 3776.54] money to create. And like you said, at our scale, it's not making that much of an impact anyway.
[3777.12 → 3783.14] Um, yeah, I don't know. But it's smaller creators who are being hurt by this in a big way. Like I'll just
[3783.14 → 3787.66] sell more screwdrivers. Let's go. Well, come on, buy some screwdrivers. All I have to do is say
[3787.66 → 3792.48] that it really does work. If I say buy screwdrivers, especially on WAN show, you guys are like,
[3792.62 → 3797.64] you guys are actually nuts. Um, you guys are just like, okay, let's buy more screwdrivers this week.
[3797.64 → 3803.34] Like there really will is an uptick. Um, I, I'm actually not saying that I'm actually going to say,
[3803.50 → 3809.48] wait until next week and then buy some screwdrivers. Oh, is it next? It might be two weeks,
[3809.48 → 3816.02] but yeah. Wait until sometime. Yeah. There's don't. Okay. Buy a screwdriver. Eventually.
[3817.20 → 3820.78] Hold on. I got to roll my dice to see if my force works.
[3821.70 → 3822.10] Nice.
[3825.02 → 3829.74] Chat be like too late, too late. There's also, and I want to reiterate this point too. There's a huge
[3829.74 → 3837.08] range to this type of stuff. Um, and it's all not only are the four pillars like kind of gray,
[3837.08 → 3843.46] the huge range of different types of React content out there is also kind of gray. Some people do it
[3843.46 → 3848.58] significantly more transformatively. I've seen people who have done react content to like a two
[3848.58 → 3854.06] minute video and the video is like 55 minutes long because they start going into whatever. And it's
[3854.06 → 3859.46] like, okay, that's, that's one way to do it. Another way to do it is to entirely leave the room for the
[3859.46 → 3863.80] entire duration of the video. And as it just autoplays on your stream or whatever else there's,
[3863.80 → 3870.22] there's, and there's everything in between. So I don't know. It's not, it's not up to us to really
[3870.22 → 3875.24] decide, but someone's going to eventually, and that'll be an fascinating day.
[3878.30 → 3879.54] Speaking of interesting day.
[3879.72 → 3885.04] Hold on. I was going to say I, because so many of these people are live, like six, eight,
[3885.34 → 3892.90] 10 hours a day. I'd have to imagine that when this goes down, like when the first one gets for real,
[3892.90 → 3899.66] like a $10 million lawsuit or something like that, or like get served, I'd be, I'd be very
[3899.66 → 3905.54] interested to see if everybody's live and like figuring this out in real time, like, oh wow,
[3905.54 → 3913.02] I am actually next. And oh wow. If they win that suit, there are so many other potential litigators
[3913.02 → 3918.18] that could be coming right after them. Like I am done. I have a big feeling. A lot of people just
[3918.18 → 3921.82] don't want to be the first, like a lot of the litigators don't want to be the first one,
[3922.62 → 3928.22] but yeah, we'll see. I also think if stuff like this does go to court, it's going to be
[3928.22 → 3930.62] some of the most viewed content like ever.
[3930.62 → 3931.06] Yeah.
[3931.14 → 3933.80] Because the streamers are definitely going to find ways to stream it.
[3933.98 → 3935.38] Oh yeah, for sure. A hundred percent.
[3935.48 → 3937.06] And it's going to be very interesting.
[3937.08 → 3940.54] And they're going to find ways to try and weaponize their audience against whoever,
[3940.78 → 3946.24] whoever goes after them, whether that's the right thing to do or not. And the funny thing is like
[3946.24 → 3954.52] so many of the big copyright holders are definitely super evil, even if suing over very valid
[3954.52 → 3958.50] infringement of their copyrighted content is not a particularly evil thing to do.
[3958.50 → 3963.42] Yeah. Like it would be pretty easy to, you know, turn something around on Disney and go,
[3963.72 → 3968.90] you know, yeah, well you do whatever, whatever and whatever. How are, how do you imagine yourself
[3968.90 → 3972.60] to be on some kind of moral high ground here or whatever? Oh, I just, I just, it's going to be
[3972.60 → 3980.40] a gong show. The meta moment. I can't wait. People live reacting to people on stream reacting to live
[3980.40 → 3986.08] streamers who reacted to content who are getting sued in court. It's just going to be the sickest like
[3986.08 → 3992.76] meta view ever. I don't know. It's going to be wild if it happens. I don't know. Anyway,
[3994.30 → 3997.18] new topic. I'd love to see Twitch plays. I'd love to see Twitch plays.
[3997.18 → 4000.16] Twitch plays streamer. Oh, yeah. Twitch plays defence lawyer.
[4001.66 → 4006.88] So the argument is just this random gibberish based on the first word of everyone's message
[4006.88 → 4011.16] in chat. The lawyer just starts doing some random TikTok dance in like the middle of the
[4011.16 → 4016.54] proceedings. I'm going to start doing it. Stream court LMAO. That's well, well,
[4017.12 → 4025.84] meta weaponized reaction. Stop. It is cluster speaking meta if. Oh, they'll mete that time slur.
[4030.26 → 4032.38] Good argument. Good argument. Good argument.
[4032.38 → 4032.44] Good argument.
[4032.44 → 4038.72] I'm sure at least one person in the audience is like, am I, am I losing it? What? Like,
[4038.72 → 4044.38] am I, am I okay? Someone's too focused on Baldur's Gate right now. Then they just heard that.
[4044.46 → 4051.78] They're like, whoa. Is he speaking English? I need some water. I don't know what's going on.
[4052.40 → 4056.16] You know what's going on right now is telling you about our sponsors of the show.
[4056.16 → 4062.56] Let's go. Let's go. By the way, apparently speaking of former sponsors, uh, someone posted
[4062.56 → 4070.04] this in Twitch chat. I haven't validated it yet. Um, try a hard film. It said anchor removed
[4070.04 → 4075.68] us live LMAO. So can we validate this? Can someone in float plane chat where people are
[4075.68 → 4080.98] more reliable, have a look at this and see if, uh, see if maybe that actually happened in
[4080.98 → 4086.96] which case, Hey, that's a that's a good thing to finally do the right thing and listen.
[4088.10 → 4094.72] Living in float plane chat says, yeah, it's done. That is hilarious. Uh, Living also says,
[4095.00 → 4100.04] um, we posted it earlier too. Sorry, float plane chat. Sorry, float plane chat. That was,
[4100.14 → 4102.32] that just happens to be where I saw it first. Okay.
[4102.32 → 4105.90] I absolutely don't see it anymore. The whole bar is gone as far as I can tell.
[4106.52 → 4107.28] Like they just removed everyone.
[4107.28 → 4113.18] I think it was just one image. Uh, makes sense. Anyway, the show is brought to you today by

[4311.16 → 4315.96] Oh it's time to do three merch messages. Oh, whoa. We wait we haven't even talked about the new products.
[4316.82 → 4322.44] We were like an hour into the show. Luke how did you let this happen? Hold on. I blame Luke. Hold on. Oh, what?
[4322.44 → 4332.50] Oh we're still there. We're on the Anchor site. The float plane chat was highly investigative and found that
[4332.50 → 4334.70] Anchor's just really not that thorough at the end of the day.
[4337.32 → 4342.14] Speaking of the highly investigative float plane chat. Okay we're going to get to the merch messages in a second.
[4342.82 → 4350.60] Thank you Marlon by the way. We cover an incredibly broad range of tech here. Everything from you know doing
[4350.60 → 4360.60] tours of nuclear reactors, and you know freaking quantum chip companies to you know the latest
[4360.60 → 4368.10] smartphones and tablets and whatever else. Hold on. Okay there's even more. Yeah, we need to deal with this.
[4370.40 → 4375.80] We had a situation with a script earlier this week when oh hold on someone's calling me now. Is this
[4375.80 → 4379.22] is this Mr. Nick Light? Yeah, it's Mr. Nick Light. Why does that not surprise me?
[4379.22 → 4386.28] Hey um no I'm just correcting chat that yours it wasn't on Amazon desktop to begin with it was on
[4386.28 → 4391.66] the mobile app, and it's still there so they haven't fixed anything. Anchor's still not yeah they're bad.
[4391.90 → 4393.86] Okay goodbye. Thanks, Nick. See you later.
[4396.00 → 4401.56] And they're on there's a ton of different Anchor pages that you're on like on it's its all over
[4401.56 → 4407.24] place like look at this one apparently uh apparently they are the official charging partner
[4407.24 → 4414.60] for Linus Tech Tips. Yeah, they're not. We don't have one right now. Yeah. Cool. All right anyway so
[4414.60 → 4421.76] we cover a really, really wide range of tech, and we had a situation this week when I got up looking at
[4421.76 → 4427.46] a script that I hadn't reviewed. I can't review every single one, but I got up started reading off the
[4427.46 → 4438.50] prompter and within two paragraphs I had found about it was either three or four not errors but
[4438.50 → 4445.06] things that were left open to interpretation in a way that could have potentially resulted in someone
[4445.06 → 4452.72] coming away with the wrong impression. And it made me think like what is a realistic solution to this
[4452.72 → 4456.68] because we can't expect our generalist writers to know everything about anything.
[4457.32 → 4463.74] We can't take up the lab's team with all the data that they're busy figuring out how to build
[4463.74 → 4473.36] workflows for and generate. What is a solution to this? And it made me think remember in the early
[4473.36 → 4480.22] days of Vessel where we would launch videos with early access and so people on Vessel would have seven
[4480.22 → 4485.24] days to watch before the video would be uploaded to YouTube, and they ended up catching a lot of
[4485.24 → 4492.26] little things that like okay you know realistically if we were perfect we would have caught in the first
[4492.26 → 4496.86] place. And we do catch a lot of stuff. And we do catch a lot of stuff, and we mostly get things right
[4496.86 → 4504.60] but you know sometimes it's sometimes it's an editor interpreting guidance from a writer that was
[4504.60 → 4511.84] written based on a verbal conversation with me. And things can get things can get lost in translation
[4511.84 → 4515.72] a little bit, or we can, or we can miss things. There's even problems where like if you put a graphic
[4515.72 → 4522.28] on screen that was generated in-house sometimes if the first and the last letters of a word are correct
[4522.28 → 4528.60] sometimes your brain will just like sort it out. So what do you think of the idea of recruiting like
[4528.60 → 4534.78] like a community like bug tracker squad? A crack team of investigators? What would a program like
[4534.78 → 4542.52] that look like to make sense to you? I kind of pitched earlier I don't know if you saw that
[4542.52 → 4550.48] message but a hidden channel on Flow plane. That is already functionality that we have liked I have a
[4550.48 → 4555.56] channel on Flow plane that is not public. It's like videos of my bird and random stuff like that
[4555.56 → 4561.00] that I use for testing uploads. Yeah. So we can have a hidden channel that's invite only
[4561.00 → 4564.68] that people could check out. I don't know how you recruit for that community necessarily.
[4565.08 → 4569.96] How do we make this make sense though? Make it like a worthwhile thing for them to do? Yeah, like is
[4569.96 → 4574.36] this the kind of thing where? It could be like a bug bounty style system. How do you do that when
[4574.36 → 4579.52] because realistically our problem is that with the breadth of things that we talk about with the breadth of
[4579.52 → 4584.44] things that we cover like people are like you hire a fact-checker. It's like yeah I could hire a fact
[4584.44 → 4592.04] checker but like no one is going to know electrical engineering and mechanical engineering and
[4592.04 → 4598.28] something about. Literally every flavour of engineering. Some weird motherboard from 15 years ago. And all the
[4598.28 → 4603.64] history of all electronics ever. And that time that Apple actually they did do that thing you said
[4603.64 → 4613.64] they've never done. Like it's its it's something that can be done, but it's something that is not necessarily
[4614.68 → 4621.24] practically done. It would involve probably doubling the size of the writing team which is not necessarily
[4621.80 → 4628.68] realistic. So how do we make a program like this make sense to everyone? And people are saying yeah your
[4628.68 → 4634.60] fan base is incredible, and they would do it for free, and it's like yeah we know that but the point
[4634.60 → 4639.32] is not to be exploitative. The point is to do it in a way that does make sense. And if we had a bug
[4639.32 → 4644.44] checking program it's like what are we supposed to be writing like 50 cent checks to people who found
[4645.16 → 4649.56] one bug? Like what's what's what does a payment threshold for that even look like? Like honestly
[4649.56 → 4657.00] this is the first valid application of something like a Linus crypto coin. No I'm serious though.
[4657.00 → 4661.96] Like some kind of some kind of token or something so that it actually you know gets
[4663.00 → 4667.64] gets paid out at some point once you reach something like I actually don't know the way to do this.
[4668.92 → 4673.48] Yeah we could have like um people are talking about okay you could find a bug
[4673.48 → 4677.40] and you get a get credit towards your float plane account or something like that, but that's
[4677.40 → 4682.92] that kind of screws over float planes books um a little bit. I just punched the thing that's on
[4682.92 → 4687.80] you thought I don't I mean I don't really don't care. That depends on what our new CEO sets all your KPIs as
[4687.80 → 4691.40] so. Fair enough that's on him then. I have nothing to do with that well it could, I'm just saying it
[4691.40 → 4696.52] could be on you is all sure I'm just saying it might matter. Yeah, um I don't know like he'll have
[4696.52 → 4700.76] to answer for the previous CEO's business decisions. People are talking about like LTT store credits um
[4700.76 → 4709.96] you know like what I want to spitball this because I the first reaction internally was let's hire a
[4709.96 → 4714.60] fact-checker or a fact checking team. Yeah. And I'm like the the just sheer volume they're going
[4714.60 → 4719.08] to have to look at because they're not just going to look at things once. They're going to have to look
[4719.08 → 4724.12] at it at the draft stage. They're going to have to look at it again when I'm done with it because I
[4724.12 → 4729.56] might make changes that introduce errors. For the most part I reduce errors in our scripts. You guys wouldn't
[4729.56 → 4735.64] believe people can just have a bad day. Even really smart people on the team who are really
[4735.64 → 4742.68] knowledgeable can just f*** it up like terrible, and I'll come, and I'll be like hey I don't
[4742.68 → 4746.84] actually know the right answer here necessarily because I don't have a background in this. But this
[4746.84 → 4751.16] ain't it. But this does not look right, and we'll have to dig into it together and like that's why
[4751.16 → 4756.20] script review can sometimes take two or three hours right it's not because I just enjoy the sound of my
[4756.20 → 4760.84] own voice. It's because I'm trying to make sure that the quality of the content is as good as we
[4760.84 → 4766.60] can get it. And I'm pretty experienced at it, and it's already not something that I would even have
[4766.60 → 4771.96] time to do to look at every piece of content. Remember stage three it needs to be looked at
[4771.96 → 4778.68] again once it's been edited because there could be visual errors. Sticker packs.
[4780.12 → 4784.36] Now someone says that Bigfoot says the trouble with crowdsourcing it is that you'll have to have an
[4784.36 → 4789.16] internal team to filter out the garbage reports you get. Yeah, absolutely. But that's at least
[4789.16 → 4795.32] manageable. That's a manageable number of hires. We could hire two researchers whose job is to take
[4795.32 → 4803.88] every report and actually find out. Like be the gophers internally to okay someone said that display
[4803.88 → 4809.88] HDR 600 something okay I'm going to go talk to Brandon about this and verify it while also
[4809.88 → 4812.76] calling up VESA and seeing what they have to say about it.
[4812.76 → 4817.88] It would take you an astronomical amount of time to fact-check every single statement ever made in
[4817.88 → 4823.16] every single piece of content that we release. But even if you're not a subject-matter expert you could
[4823.16 → 4828.04] probably fact check one specific statement that was flagged by three different like red team reviewers
[4828.84 → 4832.52] and call up the right people like you were saying email up the right people whatever it is and get to
[4832.52 → 4836.84] the bottom of it. People are suggesting you know it could be like an intern team or something like
[4836.84 → 4843.64] that and the counter to that is like a don't really believe in hiring people just for being
[4843.64 → 4848.28] cheap labour. It would need to potentially lead to a full-time job. Yeah, like we're not we're not about
[4848.28 → 4854.44] that and b having junior people do this actually would be kind of counterproductive. I have found over
[4854.44 → 4859.88] the years that new people can be intimidated and can actually really struggle to bring up problems
[4859.88 → 4864.20] and it's its nothing against them, it's just it's kind of part of human nature right when there's a
[4864.20 → 4869.72] power imbalance in an interaction you tend to shy away from you know being negative or being critical
[4869.72 → 4874.52] whereas the audience doesn't which is one of the reasons actually that I want to find a way to do
[4874.52 → 4877.00] this with the audience because you f***ERS don't hold back.
[4877.00 → 4881.48] Oh man.
[4882.84 → 4889.08] Yeah it's rough because like I think it kind of has to be manual recruitment or else you're just
[4889.08 → 4894.60] releasing all the videos early to everyone uh so it has to be manual recruitment so then
[4894.60 → 4899.00] are you dealing with like applications or do you have someone internally like headhunting?
[4899.00 → 4904.52] I don't know. Do you just grab current like moderators because they'd be down, but then you're
[4904.52 → 4908.28] putting more work on top of them? Yeah, they're already like they're already helping us in a big
[4908.28 → 4912.60] way, and we appreciate appreciate appreciate our moderators so.
[4912.60 → 4916.20] And and and you know those guys are usually down for whatever.
[4916.20 → 4917.72] I know so that's the thing.
[4917.72 → 4919.96] By putting it on them, you are just adding work.
[4919.96 → 4926.44] I hate asking people who are already voluntarily doing stuff because you know it's in their nature to
[4926.44 → 4929.48] to want to be helpful, and you're like yo.
[4929.48 → 4931.48] So you have to limit your ask sometimes.
[4931.48 → 4933.56] I can't, I don't want to put any pressure on you actually though.
[4933.56 → 4934.44] Yeah yeah.
[4934.44 → 4937.88] Like I would never ask Timestamp Guy to do the timestamps.
[4937.88 → 4939.56] Yeah oh.
[4939.56 → 4944.28] I would never be like hey we've got a special stream planned on a Tuesday can you make sure you're
[4944.28 → 4945.64] can you make sure you make it?
[4945.64 → 4946.68] Yeah that's messed up.
[4946.68 → 4947.40] We need you on time.
[4947.40 → 4948.68] That's messed up right?
[4948.68 → 4949.80] You can't do that.
[4949.80 → 4953.88] In addition to magically knowing that the WAN show is going to be four hours late.
[4953.88 → 4955.80] Yeah shout out Timestamp Guy float plane chat.
[4955.80 → 4956.92] Love Timestamp Guy!
[4957.48 → 4959.72] And that's the kind of community interaction.
[4959.72 → 4964.52] You guys should be the ones who are reinforcing people for engaging in the community in a way that
[4964.52 → 4966.76] is meaningful to them and meaningful to you.
[4966.76 → 4967.72] That's beautiful.
[4968.28 → 4969.24] That's what we want to see.
[4969.24 → 4971.40] We want to see you guys being cool to each other.
[4971.40 → 4974.60] We don't want to like to tell you to do stuff.
[4974.60 → 4978.20] Then you just should work here at that point.
[4978.20 → 4978.52] Right?
[4978.52 → 4980.68] So I'm I don't know.
[4980.68 → 4985.32] I'm I'm not saying how we're going to do it.
[4985.32 → 4989.56] I'm not saying we have to come to like a final conclusion today for how this is going to work.
[4989.56 → 4996.28] But it's just something that I want to kind of float by the community and see you know
[4996.28 → 4999.80] what they think of and because I don't know part of it.
[4999.80 → 5002.20] What I know is we can set up that hidden channel.
[5002.20 → 5003.80] We can do direct invites for it.
[5003.80 → 5007.64] We can manage all the stuff that way because there was a suggestion at one
[5007.64 → 5011.48] point in time to make it a sub channel for non float plane users.
[5011.48 → 5014.60] We have like primary channels or creator channels and then sub channels.
[5014.60 → 5017.64] So like the Linus media group one has all the different YouTube channels under it.
[5017.64 → 5019.80] Plus like the Belts, the X exclusives, etc.
[5021.64 → 5026.28] I didn't like that because it was going to show up in people's feeds as locked all the time,
[5026.28 → 5028.28] but there would be no way for people to access it.
[5028.28 → 5028.44] Right.
[5028.44 → 5029.96] But now we've got the sub channels.
[5030.60 → 5031.72] No, with sub channels.
[5031.72 → 5032.84] It would show up in their feeds.
[5032.84 → 5033.48] Oh, I see.
[5033.48 → 5034.20] But now we have hidden channels.
[5034.20 → 5035.88] They wouldn't get notifications, but yeah.
[5035.88 → 5036.20] Right.
[5036.20 → 5038.12] So I like the idea of a hidden channel instead.
[5039.48 → 5041.88] But then people aren't going to see it all the time.
[5041.88 → 5042.20] Yeah.
[5042.20 → 5047.88] So like what's the mechanism for them to want to like to apply to join or whatever mechanism
[5047.88 → 5048.84] or however we.
[5049.32 → 5051.64] I think calling it out on WAN show is simple enough.
[5052.20 → 5054.84] Like we're going to have a form or something like this is what I know.
[5054.84 → 5056.04] I'm a mechanical engineer.
[5056.44 → 5060.20] I am happy to watch videos that could use that.
[5060.60 → 5065.80] I wonder if an easier way would be for them to just self select and then
[5066.36 → 5070.52] you know in the videos that we publish because we wouldn't even necessarily leave them up.
[5070.52 → 5071.48] Like why would we?
[5071.48 → 5079.88] So in the drafts that we publish, we would basically just say, you know, audio, you know,
[5080.52 → 5082.52] I O technologies display.
[5084.20 → 5086.92] And if you like know stuff about that, then you dive in.
[5087.88 → 5091.40] I almost wonder if we're going to have to switch to like Google Docs too.
[5093.40 → 5098.28] So you, so because right now we use Microsoft for all of our internal script writing.
[5098.28 → 5099.08] Oh, I see.
[5099.08 → 5102.68] And for like annotating and all that kind of stuff.
[5102.68 → 5103.48] There was a conversation.
[5103.48 → 5104.92] I don't know if you were in it.
[5104.92 → 5106.60] There was a conversation today about doing that.
[5106.60 → 5106.84] Yeah.
[5106.84 → 5109.24] So maybe, maybe it's finally time to do it.
[5109.24 → 5113.80] And then part of the process for this is that we're publishing these drafts with people
[5113.80 → 5118.28] having comment access and letting them kind of have conversations and kind of go, okay,
[5118.28 → 5118.60] yeah.
[5118.84 → 5125.56] You know, when you said HDMI is ideal for 4k output, you really should have specified HDMI
[5125.56 → 5126.52] 2.0.
[5126.52 → 5131.88] And then someone goes, actually, I think they should specify HDMI 2.0 and up.
[5131.88 → 5136.60] That's the most correct way to say it, because that's the kind of little stuff that generally
[5136.60 → 5138.12] is slipping under the radar.
[5138.12 → 5140.20] The only problem that I see happening there.
[5140.20 → 5145.88] So I, I, I, I like the idea primarily moving to Google Docs.
[5147.72 → 5148.04] Nice.
[5148.60 → 5150.76] Moving on from there, the comment system thing.
[5151.16 → 5155.00] The only problem I see is that there's going to need to be some amount of like moderation
[5155.00 → 5156.76] in regard to who can do it.
[5156.76 → 5164.36] And the we run the, the, the possibility of like, you know, hurting some feels because
[5164.36 → 5167.80] it's going to need to be focused.
[5167.80 → 5172.12] We also run the possibility of creating some negativity internally.
[5172.12 → 5172.68] Yeah.
[5172.68 → 5177.64] I mean, one of the things that, that I had proposed, even though I had no idea how to administer
[5177.64 → 5185.40] it was maybe we should take part of the writing team's bonus structure and start paying it
[5185.40 → 5186.52] out to people who catch bugs.
[5187.64 → 5194.12] Just say, yeah, you guys keep all of this until there's like a hundred corrections in our videos
[5194.12 → 5195.24] this month from the community.
[5195.24 → 5197.00] And then it actually gets paid out to them instead.
[5197.00 → 5197.40] Yeah.
[5197.40 → 5201.48] Now, obviously punitive measures, all they do is create negativity.
[5201.48 → 5202.52] So we're not going to do that.
[5202.52 → 5202.92] Yeah.
[5202.92 → 5203.16] Right.
[5203.16 → 5208.44] But it, you know, from my point of view, you know, if I pay people to be correct, well,
[5208.44 → 5211.64] then I might as well pay the correct people who are actually correct.
[5211.64 → 5213.96] Do you remember earlier when you were talking about like how to be a good parent?
[5213.96 → 5214.44] Oh, I know.
[5214.44 → 5214.84] Yeah.
[5214.84 → 5215.16] I know.
[5215.16 → 5219.80] I, you, you can't do stuff like that, but there are definitely times I wish I could.
[5219.80 → 5220.12] Yeah.
[5220.12 → 5220.20] Yeah.
[5220.20 → 5220.52] Yeah.
[5220.52 → 5220.60] Yeah.
[5220.60 → 5220.84] Yeah.
[5220.84 → 5221.24] Yeah.
[5221.24 → 5224.12] So then, you know, the, the question is a terrible idea.
[5224.12 → 5227.64] Oh, I know the question is like, well, okay, where does that bucket come from then?
[5227.64 → 5228.04] Right.
[5228.04 → 5231.32] Do we have a way of, that's where like the line, speaking of bad ideas, that's where
[5231.32 → 5232.68] the Linus coin thing comes from.
[5232.68 → 5237.00] Like do like, what is our way of, what is our way of administering this?
[5237.00 → 5240.20] Like I literally cannot have Yvonne writing 50 cent checks.
[5240.20 → 5241.16] Yeah.
[5241.16 → 5242.92] That is literally.
[5242.92 → 5247.24] I think how most of these things would work is you would, you would like to grow your pool
[5247.24 → 5248.68] up to a payout minimum.
[5248.68 → 5249.00] Sure.
[5249.00 → 5253.08] But then kind of like the same issue that you see with something like a Twitch,
[5253.08 → 5256.12] the vast majority of people will never reach that minimum.
[5256.12 → 5256.36] Yeah.
[5256.36 → 5260.36] And then, and then you have the potential to create negativity in the community.
[5260.36 → 5261.80] And that's even worse.
[5261.80 → 5266.60] I would actually rather have a tough, you know, tough dad conversation with someone
[5266.60 → 5271.08] internally where I can make it up to them in some other way, you know, down the line.
[5271.08 → 5274.20] But that's, that's that negative negativity in the community thing is the thing that I'm
[5274.20 → 5278.68] kind of worried about the, uh, on the like free comment thing on the sheet.
[5278.68 → 5279.08] For sure.
[5279.08 → 5285.96] Because if, if someone's like, uh, if, if, if Emily's working on a, on a doc and someone
[5285.96 → 5289.80] sees that Emily's working on the doc, and they're like, like, I've always wanted to talk to Emily.
[5289.80 → 5291.64] I'm going to make a comment saying hi, Emily.
[5291.64 → 5296.52] Like that's very distracting for people and actually like can't happen.
[5296.52 → 5297.80] It has to stay objective.
[5297.80 → 5299.00] It has to stay on topic.
[5299.00 → 5301.08] It has to be exactly what you were kind of talking about.
[5301.08 → 5301.24] Right.
[5301.24 → 5303.32] Uh, you should have specified 2.0.
[5303.32 → 5306.60] Uh, you should maybe specify 2.0 and above.
[5306.60 → 5307.80] Both of those comments are great.
[5308.76 → 5313.80] But when you get into like kind of off-topic, conversational stuff, or instead of identifying
[5313.80 → 5317.32] a problem and then research happening to make sure that they find the right answer and then
[5317.32 → 5321.56] plugging in right answer, it's identify a problem and then discuss it for half an hour,
[5321.56 → 5323.08] because that's kind of more entertaining.
[5323.08 → 5326.84] Like those things, that's not going to be good.
[5327.56 → 5331.88] You know, Jack WS3E says your staff doesn't have to be an expert on everything, but if you're
[5331.88 → 5335.24] going to be dropping information, you should double-check that information no matter what.
[5335.24 → 5339.32] It's amazing how many things are common knowledge that are completely false in this modern age.
[5339.32 → 5343.08] And it's just a good thing to work towards not letting that standard slip and bypassing it
[5343.08 → 5344.92] like a modern mainstream media organization.
[5344.92 → 5347.24] That's exactly what we're trying to do.
[5347.24 → 5354.76] We're just trying to cast the widest possible net because I think, yeah, that's, that's been
[5354.76 → 5359.32] a real struggle is that one person or even a dozen people can't know everything about everything
[5359.32 → 5361.24] and you're going to have mistakes, and we don't want them.
[5364.44 → 5365.00] Yeah.
[5365.00 → 5370.28] So, so atomic age ace said, wouldn't this just create more work?
[5370.28 → 5374.76] People can be confidently incorrect, and you'll have to review every blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5374.76 → 5375.24] Yeah.
[5375.24 → 5377.72] I mean, that's almost guaranteed going to happen.
[5377.72 → 5380.28] There might even be someone who's consistently very correct.
[5380.28 → 5384.04] And then every once in a while just tries to correct something and is wrong about it.
[5384.04 → 5386.52] That's why you have more than one person looking at it.
[5386.52 → 5386.76] Yeah.
[5387.72 → 5390.84] And we, yeah, yeah.
[5390.84 → 5392.76] Moderating, it does sound like kind of a challenge.
[5392.76 → 5395.16] I think we'd have to start with a pretty small cohort.
[5396.12 → 5397.72] Um, and you know,
[5398.92 → 5401.32] The like community management of this is just going to be hard,
[5401.32 → 5407.64] but we also, if someone is really genuinely trying to contribute, and then we end up like
[5407.64 → 5412.28] removing them from the pool or, or they contribute in a way that is really positive.
[5412.28 → 5413.88] They, they correct something.
[5414.36 → 5419.24] And then I go through in my script review and I go, this is entirely tangential to the
[5419.24 → 5420.28] point of this video.
[5420.28 → 5421.88] Uh, this whole section is out.
[5421.88 → 5422.12] I'm cutting it.
[5422.12 → 5423.80] Well, then their work was like wasted.
[5424.44 → 5431.48] It's like, well, no, because you know, part of this too is I've always seen it as a two-way street,
[5431.72 → 5431.96] right?
[5431.96 → 5435.48] Like people learn from the videos and I also learn from reading the comments.
[5435.48 → 5436.44] That's why I read them.
[5437.64 → 5441.08] It's because I will often learn things in the comments, right?
[5441.08 → 5444.12] It's the classic, what's the best way to learn something on the internet,
[5444.12 → 5446.20] say something wrong and wait for someone to correct you.
[5446.20 → 5446.92] Right?
[5446.92 → 5453.16] Like I have, I have learned more from reading comments in all these years than I probably
[5453.16 → 5453.56] have.
[5453.56 → 5455.48] Oh, I shouldn't say that.
[5455.48 → 5460.12] No, I haven't learned more than I have firsthand, but I've learned a lot from reading comments
[5460.12 → 5465.88] and then especially doing follow-up reading of my own to kind of broaden my understanding
[5465.88 → 5469.88] of why someone said the thing that they said.
[5469.88 → 5471.32] Um, yeah.
[5471.32 → 5476.52] Well, let's, let's, let's think.
[5476.52 → 5480.04] Someone said, why not just make your writer cite their sources and submit the sources for
[5480.04 → 5480.36] review?
[5480.36 → 5481.48] It doesn't really work that way.
[5481.48 → 5481.72] Yeah.
[5481.72 → 5485.16] But it doesn't mean that they quoted the source properly.
[5485.16 → 5489.16] Also the source, like sometimes the source is us.
[5489.16 → 5489.48] Yeah.
[5489.48 → 5489.64] Yeah.
[5489.64 → 5491.00] Like what if, okay.
[5491.00 → 5494.52] What if the writer were to say something like, um,
[5494.52 → 5503.08] um, DisplayPort 1.4, uh, can't run at this resolution and refresh rate.
[5503.08 → 5509.96] But what it turns out is that the particular monitor that they ran it on worked out before
[5509.96 → 5511.24] that.
[5511.24 → 5515.80] And they just had no way of knowing that that was, that that was not possible because
[5515.80 → 5518.12] like it was supposed to or something.
[5518.12 → 5521.08] Then if someone jumped in and went, well, hold on a second, I'm actually running that,
[5521.08 → 5523.88] that resolution and refresh rate on my monitor.
[5523.88 → 5524.92] So it, so it can do it.
[5525.80 → 5528.84] Well then all of a sudden, hey, at least we're investigating that.
[5528.84 → 5533.88] And we're kind of going, oh, well, instead of us giving up now that we thought, oh, okay,
[5533.88 → 5535.72] well it's a limitation with the interface.
[5536.28 → 5538.84] Now we get to explore why this monitor can't do it, right?
[5538.84 → 5544.28] Like it's, it's making sure that we're not wasting our time going down the wrong paths as well.
[5544.28 → 5545.72] Like it's not that we're not willing to do the work.
[5545.72 → 5547.40] We just want to make sure we're doing the right work.
[5547.40 → 5552.28] A bit of a community management minefield.
[5552.28 → 5554.20] Well, I mean, lots of options.
[5554.20 → 5555.64] Steven's doing a great job so far.
[5555.64 → 5559.16] I think he's off his 90-day probation now, so I can, I can talk about Chewy.
[5560.52 → 5565.16] Yeah, he's, he, we finally have a dedicated community manager person on the social team.
[5565.16 → 5570.20] So this is something that I could see him really sinking his teeth into is, you know,
[5570.20 → 5573.32] trying to get something like this going in collaboration with James and Jake and the
[5573.32 → 5574.76] rest of the writing team.
[5574.76 → 5579.24] But we'll see, you know, and, and, and you know what, he's been a perfect advocate
[5579.24 → 5580.92] for the community internally.
[5580.92 → 5581.64] So if he sees a way that...
[5581.64 → 5584.04] I'm not, yeah, like I'm not slagging him at all to be clear.
[5584.04 → 5584.12] I know.
[5584.12 → 5586.92] This just sounds like a very difficult task for, for him.
[5586.92 → 5592.12] Yeah, but I think he's got a he's got a lot of experience, not in this specifically,
[5592.12 → 5594.28] but like, like Twitch moderation and stuff like that.
[5594.28 → 5601.08] So he, as an as a community member for so many years, I think he understands that side's
[5601.08 → 5602.04] perspective really well.
[5602.04 → 5605.48] A good, I don't, I'm not saying he hasn't been already to be clear, but probably a good
[5605.48 → 5607.32] person to include in the ideation of this.
[5607.32 → 5607.72] Yeah.
[5607.72 → 5608.04] Yeah.
[5608.04 → 5610.84] Oh, oh, there's no way that I would just prescribe how we're doing this.
[5610.84 → 5611.72] I don't do that anymore.
[5611.72 → 5612.20] No.
[5612.20 → 5617.16] That's actually not my job anymore, but it's just something that as the vision officer,
[5617.16 → 5623.16] I've kind of visioned that realistically, if we want to cast the widest possible net
[5623.16 → 5629.00] and want to make sure that we are investigating the right things, well, our community has always
[5629.00 → 5631.48] been our number one source.
[5631.48 → 5638.84] We're just doing it before publication instead of after publication, which seems smart.
[5638.84 → 5639.56] Yeah.
[5639.56 → 5640.60] Seems wise.
[5640.60 → 5642.12] Yeah.
[5642.12 → 5643.72] Okay.
[5645.80 → 5646.12] Oh.
[5646.12 → 5646.84] All right.
[5646.84 → 5650.68] Well, why don't you pipe up then, Dan, if you know what we're supposed to be doing?
[5650.68 → 5653.32] You don't even have your mic ready, Mr. Three Merch Messages.
[5653.32 → 5654.28] Shake the sign.
[5655.32 → 5656.52] Don't make me tap the sign.
[5656.52 → 5658.60] I was going to say, it's like he's tapping the glass.
[5660.04 → 5661.40] Uh, you want some merch messages then?
[5661.40 → 5662.20] You're going to move on.
[5662.20 → 5663.00] No, no, I don't.
[5663.00 → 5665.32] I want to open this gift that I got at LTX.
[5665.32 → 5666.04] Let's open the gift.
[5666.04 → 5667.48] Just as an F you to Dan.
[5668.36 → 5670.52] The giver assured me it is not a bomb.
[5670.52 → 5671.08] Oh.
[5671.08 → 5672.68] But I'm going to have you open it anyway.
[5672.68 → 5675.08] I'm going to step out for unrelated reasons.
[5675.80 → 5676.36] Thanks, Dan.
[5676.36 → 5677.08] No, he's still there.
[5677.08 → 5678.52] Wait, isn't it a gift for you?
[5678.52 → 5679.64] Why do you want me to open it?
[5679.64 → 5679.88] I don't know.
[5679.88 → 5681.08] You want me to like present it to you?
[5681.08 → 5682.28] Just make sure it's not a bomb.
[5682.28 → 5683.00] Okay, sounds good.
[5683.00 → 5683.40] I'm down.
[5683.40 → 5684.36] You'll check though, right?
[5684.36 → 5684.76] Yeah.
[5684.76 → 5688.92] I mean realistically, a bomb that size, it's not like I'm actually saving myself, so.
[5688.92 → 5689.56] Yeah, I know.
[5689.56 → 5691.96] I thought you were being like, I'd be fine.
[5691.96 → 5692.68] I'm like, nah.
[5692.68 → 5695.88] Well, if you turn the other way, that would help a lot.
[5695.88 → 5696.76] I'll do it like this.
[5696.76 → 5697.40] Just meat shield.
[5699.64 → 5700.60] Okay, am I going for it?
[5700.60 → 5701.96] Sacrificial Luke.
[5701.96 → 5703.00] We need a shirt now.
[5703.00 → 5704.20] This is fine.
[5704.20 → 5706.20] I'm surprisingly comfortable in this position.
[5706.20 → 5710.04] Just like Luke in fetal position crouching over an exploding bomb.
[5710.04 → 5711.32] I got it guys, get out of here.
[5713.32 → 5714.12] Go for it, go for it.
[5714.12 → 5715.16] Okay, okay.
[5716.04 → 5716.60] Oh.
[5717.32 → 5719.00] I have no idea what's in here.
[5719.00 → 5721.40] A creator gave it to me at LTX.
[5724.36 → 5725.48] It's not a bomb.
[5726.84 → 5729.08] It's a little, I was a little surprised.
[5729.80 → 5732.76] It's a fan.
[5733.56 → 5733.96] Um.
[5734.52 → 5735.48] It's a heat sink.
[5737.00 → 5737.48] Maybe it's.
[5737.48 → 5738.68] The box is sealed.
[5738.68 → 5740.20] Maybe it's in a heat sink box.
[5740.20 → 5742.52] Wait, so you haven't even shown the audience yet, Luke.
[5742.52 → 5744.12] Are you a professional video host or what?
[5745.16 → 5745.88] Don't worry, he's good.
[5745.88 → 5746.52] He's good at this.
[5746.52 → 5749.72] We can't, I can't like, there's no like zoom, but it's a heat sink.
[5749.72 → 5749.96] Yeah.
[5749.96 → 5750.60] It's a heat sink.
[5750.60 → 5751.40] Well, there is actually.
[5751.40 → 5751.88] It's an ETS.
[5751.88 → 5753.24] This is actually a zoom, Luke.
[5753.80 → 5754.60] There we go.
[5754.60 → 5755.16] Don't worry, Dan.
[5755.16 → 5755.64] I got it.
[5756.28 → 5756.84] There you go.
[5757.32 → 5758.68] ETS F40 FS.
[5758.68 → 5759.32] Oh.
[5759.32 → 5762.76] Is this like, is this a.
[5763.00 → 5764.12] So it's a heat sink.
[5764.12 → 5765.16] Is there something else in it?
[5765.16 → 5765.64] Maybe?
[5765.64 → 5766.36] It's sealed.
[5766.36 → 5767.48] Has it been resealed?
[5768.04 → 5768.84] I don't think so.
[5769.40 → 5769.72] Oh.
[5770.92 → 5772.12] I definitely didn't just rip it.
[5772.68 → 5773.56] Well, just rip it.
[5773.56 → 5774.36] It's fine.
[5774.36 → 5775.72] Yeah, but I ripped the cardboard.
[5775.72 → 5778.04] Is it because they're my biggest fan?
[5778.04 → 5779.08] No, probably not.
[5779.08 → 5780.28] I think they're, I think.
[5781.40 → 5783.80] Are you going to name the creator or is this like a.
[5785.08 → 5785.48] Wow.
[5785.64 → 5786.84] You put me on the spot like that.
[5786.84 → 5787.60] I don't remember.
[5787.80 → 5788.12] Okay.
[5789.56 → 5790.76] I'm so sorry.
[5790.84 → 5791.20] Wow.
[5791.32 → 5791.74] You just.
[5791.82 → 5792.14] It is.
[5792.26 → 5792.50] It is.
[5792.50 → 5793.52] You made me say it.
[5793.92 → 5794.14] Okay.
[5794.18 → 5795.42] It is definitely just a heat sink.
[5795.48 → 5796.60] It's definitely a heat sink.
[5796.62 → 5797.98] Not just a heat sink, to be clear.
[5798.18 → 5799.10] It's a very nice heat sink.
[5799.82 → 5800.12] Huh.
[5800.12 → 5802.70] But it's not, it's not like it hasn't been replaced.
[5802.82 → 5804.46] This is clearly an unopened box.
[5804.98 → 5806.28] A Prime and float plane chat.
[5806.36 → 5808.12] Did you just get re-gifted?
[5809.50 → 5810.98] You might want to put the phone back in.
[5811.20 → 5813.98] Is this like, like, was this in an early video?
[5814.18 → 5815.12] No, this is new.
[5815.20 → 5817.32] He uploaded a video of him giving it to you.
[5818.62 → 5819.06] Uh, yeah.
[5819.20 → 5819.60] Oh, okay.
[5819.66 → 5820.22] Did he say anything?
[5820.22 → 5820.56] Who was it?
[5820.60 → 5820.70] Yeah.
[5820.76 → 5821.42] Did he like.
[5822.22 → 5824.12] Say it's meaningful for a particular reason?
[5824.98 → 5825.30] Really?
[5826.44 → 5827.08] Is it?
[5827.26 → 5828.78] Can I, can I, can I.
[5828.96 → 5829.18] Yeah.
[5829.18 → 5829.26] Yeah.
[5829.60 → 5829.70] Yeah.
[5829.70 → 5830.48] Is it what?
[5830.56 → 5831.24] What did someone say?
[5831.60 → 5833.98] There's people making let that sink in jokes.
[5834.78 → 5835.62] Like, I don't know.
[5835.62 → 5838.14] Maybe I'm not CEO anymore or like, um.
[5841.30 → 5841.62] Uh.
[5842.40 → 5843.24] I feel bad.
[5843.88 → 5845.52] Did I just get trolled?
[5845.56 → 5846.56] I don't know.
[5847.00 → 5850.52] I was apparently supposed to open it there, like on the spot.
[5851.06 → 5851.16] Oh.
[5851.16 → 5856.58] But I was on my way into the BYOC to do, I think, the Beat Safer 1v1 challenge or something
[5856.58 → 5856.90] like that.
[5857.06 → 5858.18] Did you put the sticker back?
[5858.22 → 5859.18] Did you resealed it?
[5859.18 → 5859.54] Yeah.
[5859.54 → 5859.92] Oh, I'm trying to.
[5859.92 → 5861.32] So that you could regift it again.
[5861.60 → 5862.12] Oh, I'm trying to.
[5862.12 → 5862.54] Oh, I'm trying to.
[5862.54 → 5862.66] Oh, I'm trying to.
[5862.66 → 5863.22] Oh, okay.
[5864.10 → 5864.52] Um.
[5864.90 → 5865.16] Yeah.
[5866.16 → 5866.82] Merry Christmas.
[5868.38 → 5868.82] Dan?
[5868.96 → 5869.20] Yeah.
[5870.56 → 5871.28] You're going to cow-
[5871.28 → 5872.02] No, no.
[5872.02 → 5872.46] It's heavy.
[5872.46 → 5872.78] It's heavy.
[5872.78 → 5873.06] It's heavy.
[5873.06 → 5873.42] I'm not gonna.
[5873.50 → 5873.80] I'm not gonna.
[5873.80 → 5875.62] Do it, you coward.
[5875.62 → 5877.96] All right, fine.
[5878.02 → 5878.78] We're going for it.
[5878.78 → 5879.10] All right.
[5879.10 → 5879.66] All right.
[5879.66 → 5880.10] Oh.
[5880.10 → 5880.46] Oh.
[5885.76 → 5887.68] It smacked the monitor.
[5888.80 → 5889.38] It's okay.
[5889.46 → 5890.06] I got four.
[5890.20 → 5890.62] We're good.
[5891.06 → 5892.74] It actually, it shanked that one in front of you.
[5892.82 → 5894.08] You might want to raise it back up.
[5894.68 → 5895.42] There you go.
[5895.42 → 5898.20] It hit the top of the monitor.
[5899.86 → 5900.58] I forgot.
[5900.70 → 5901.78] I've also got glass here.
[5903.24 → 5903.86] That's okay.
[5903.94 → 5904.64] We'll clean it up on Tuesday.
[5904.64 → 5905.86] He doubled on dared me.
[5905.96 → 5906.14] Yeah.
[5906.62 → 5908.54] Yeah, but that was such a bad throw.
[5910.46 → 5912.04] Well, I'm going to throw it hard.
[5912.44 → 5913.24] It's his equipment.
[5914.26 → 5914.94] That's true.
[5915.24 → 5915.90] That's true.
[5915.96 → 5916.78] Are you going to dent me?
[5916.94 → 5917.20] Come on.
[5917.24 → 5917.54] Who cares?
[5917.58 → 5919.02] Yeah, what's the CEO going to do?
[5919.08 → 5919.88] Get me in trouble?
[5920.20 → 5921.08] Tell my mom?
[5921.24 → 5921.68] Exactly.
[5921.88 → 5922.58] Tell my wife.
[5922.96 → 5923.12] Uh-oh.
[5923.12 → 5925.32] That's a lot worse in this situation.
[5925.42 → 5926.68] It wasn't a...
[5926.68 → 5929.64] The CEO might tell the CFO what the CVO did.
[5931.24 → 5932.32] To Dan.
[5937.38 → 5939.20] Oh, okay.
[5939.34 → 5940.32] Chief Dan Officer.
[5941.92 → 5943.90] So, yeah, anywho.
[5944.90 → 5946.18] He officiates the Dans.
[5946.40 → 5946.78] Cool.
[5948.96 → 5951.10] I'm not even the best Dan at this company.
[5953.50 → 5954.48] What do you mean?
[5955.42 → 5959.46] Does anyone have the name of the creator that gave it to me?
[5959.50 → 5960.26] I'm so sorry.
[5960.36 → 5961.84] I feel absolutely terrible.
[5961.84 → 5962.68] Do we know what this is?
[5962.78 → 5963.30] Or that?
[5963.56 → 5964.10] No, no.
[5964.18 → 5965.34] You can open those now, too.
[5965.42 → 5967.12] We've got some other stuff for Luke to open.
[5967.66 → 5968.14] I don't know.
[5968.20 → 5968.64] I don't know.
[5968.78 → 5973.14] No one handed me these, so I don't have to, like, feel bad about having no idea why there
[5973.14 → 5974.02] was a fan in a box.
[5974.02 → 5975.02] Okay.
[5975.90 → 5976.44] It's a mug.
[5976.52 → 5977.08] There's a mug.
[5977.40 → 5977.72] Okay.
[5977.78 → 5977.90] Here.
[5977.94 → 5979.26] We're going to Luke Cam.
[5980.60 → 5981.34] There's a mug.
[5981.48 → 5985.32] There's a graphic on the mug, but I haven't been able to really make it out yet.
[5988.16 → 5988.52] Oh.
[5989.74 → 5990.98] We love tech tips.
[5992.40 → 5993.18] And it's...
[5993.18 → 5994.48] I'm assuming them and their cat.
[5995.16 → 5995.40] Oh.
[5995.58 → 5996.16] That's cute.
[5996.66 → 5997.02] All right.
[5997.28 → 5997.72] Fantastic.
[5998.92 → 5999.94] It will live there.
[6000.26 → 6000.90] For now.
[6001.30 → 6001.66] Okay.
[6001.66 → 6002.26] Until it doesn't.
[6002.30 → 6003.04] Thank you for that, Luke.
[6003.18 → 6003.64] Here we go.
[6004.06 → 6004.76] Thank you very much.
[6005.44 → 6006.30] And there's a letter.
[6007.36 → 6008.90] It looks like a birthday card.
[6009.02 → 6011.82] I do play sports that involve throwing, by the way, Staff.
[6012.06 → 6015.14] I played softball on Wednesday night, and I did great.
[6018.36 → 6018.76] Okay.
[6018.84 → 6020.14] This is actually great.
[6020.30 → 6021.14] This is fantastic.
[6021.26 → 6022.70] This adds a lot of context to the mug.
[6022.96 → 6025.36] Who the hell sends a mug with their photo on it?
[6025.36 → 6028.08] I'm BYU, and I do.
[6028.22 → 6029.36] I also love the WAN show.
[6029.48 → 6031.78] Only LZT and Paul's hardware have this mug now.
[6031.94 → 6032.86] I don't sell these.
[6032.96 → 6033.68] I'm just bored.
[6034.86 → 6037.52] That, honestly, I appreciate it much more now.
[6037.94 → 6042.20] Knowing that you were bored genuinely adds a lot to it.
[6042.22 → 6043.32] It's like, oh, I'm just going to do a thing.
[6043.78 → 6044.66] I'm feeling bored today.
[6044.68 → 6045.38] I'm just going to do a thing.
[6045.62 → 6047.40] And you did a thing, and I appreciate it.
[6048.34 → 6049.00] Very cool.
[6049.28 → 6052.66] Rod, you are so welcome to join us for softball night.
[6052.66 → 6057.82] If you email me, we would love to have you there.
[6057.90 → 6058.58] We had a blast.
[6058.68 → 6060.66] We had 17 people turn out this week.
[6060.80 → 6062.58] We had a ton of fun.
[6062.70 → 6063.94] We play a bit of a different format.
[6064.56 → 6066.10] So your team pitches.
[6067.52 → 6069.88] So the pitcher is actually on your team.
[6070.16 → 6071.46] Oh, interesting.
[6071.80 → 6072.58] I kind of like that.
[6072.58 → 6074.30] They lob it underhand, and the idea is...
[6074.30 → 6076.36] Because if you all suck, it's actually better that way.
[6076.38 → 6077.96] The idea is to have high-scoring games.
[6077.96 → 6078.32] Yeah, exactly.
[6078.32 → 6079.02] Lots of offence.
[6079.02 → 6081.30] So the pitcher gets only two throws.
[6082.18 → 6082.62] Period.
[6083.00 → 6083.56] Yep, fair enough.
[6083.68 → 6085.76] Ball, strike, tip, doesn't matter.
[6085.96 → 6086.10] Cool.
[6086.38 → 6090.20] Two throws per batter, and then the inning is over once everyone on the team is batted.
[6090.70 → 6092.80] I haven't been going because I don't want to blow up my shoulder.
[6092.88 → 6093.72] So there are no outs.
[6094.00 → 6095.88] It's just more like a pitch limit.
[6096.02 → 6100.26] So you get however many pitches your team has players times two.
[6100.80 → 6103.14] And then the pitcher swaps out at the end.
[6103.14 → 6109.96] And so typically your pitcher is your slugger, actually, because you want them to hit clean
[6109.96 → 6112.96] up at the end and just kind of try and move everybody around the bases.
[6113.22 → 6117.64] So it's a super fun format to play, especially with novice players who aren't going to hit
[6117.64 → 6118.10] too far.
[6118.28 → 6118.54] Absolutely.
[6118.96 → 6120.32] Tons and tons of offence.
[6120.32 → 6124.74] So the game was like 24 to 23 after four innings.
[6124.92 → 6132.88] Because people are just like, you know, guys like, man, freaking Elijah from Logistics,
[6133.34 → 6135.46] I'm pretty sure hit a pretty good singer.
[6136.74 → 6137.78] I had a home run.
[6138.14 → 6138.62] Very nice.
[6138.76 → 6139.10] Very nice.
[6139.24 → 6139.46] Man.
[6139.88 → 6140.28] Oh, man.
[6140.48 → 6144.94] Jake Relevance threw him for a loop because I hit a home run last time.
[6144.94 → 6150.58] And so he was all like, I'm going to move way out into left field, and I'm going to be
[6150.58 → 6151.54] ready for this one.
[6151.82 → 6155.68] And I was like, oh, you don't actually know how good I am at batting, do you?
[6155.82 → 6158.74] Because boom, deep to right field.
[6158.74 → 6159.72] See you later, buddy.
[6160.66 → 6165.84] So he had to run because we don't have enough players to have like all the outfielders playing.
[6165.98 → 6166.16] Yeah.
[6166.64 → 6167.56] Anyway, really fun.
[6168.00 → 6171.04] Maybe I could just go and just play outfield or something, but I can't.
[6171.06 → 6171.64] Yeah, I can't.
[6171.64 → 6173.56] I can't bat or pitch because my shoulders.
[6173.76 → 6174.08] Yeah.
[6174.08 → 6178.68] We did have someone who like wasn't able to run later on, and they just had someone
[6178.68 → 6179.62] pinch run for them.
[6179.88 → 6181.84] So like, whatever, like come hang out.
[6181.90 → 6182.36] We had pizza.
[6182.50 → 6183.24] I could run for people.
[6183.44 → 6183.66] Yeah.
[6183.78 → 6183.98] Yeah.
[6184.02 → 6184.36] Whatever.
[6184.60 → 6184.80] Yeah.
[6184.90 → 6185.24] Whatever.
[6185.70 → 6189.30] So yeah, Rod, you are, you are totally welcome.
[6189.48 → 6190.30] Just email me.
[6190.40 → 6195.64] For those of you who don't know who Rod is on Float plane, he's Rod, like of BS Mods,
[6195.64 → 6202.28] like helped us do Scrapyard Wars, shows up for LTX literally every single time, tirelessly
[6202.28 → 6203.42] helps us run the show.
[6203.92 → 6208.04] One of our most amazing community volunteers.
[6208.88 → 6209.98] Super cool guy.
[6210.70 → 6211.48] PC Fodder.
[6211.72 → 6214.42] Anyway, we love Rod, and he's welcome to join us for Softball Night.
[6217.00 → 6217.40] Okay.
[6217.40 → 6219.32] Oh, oh my God.
[6219.42 → 6222.06] We have to talk about the merch we're launching this week, Luke.
[6222.24 → 6224.30] How did you let me forget to talk about it again?
[6224.44 → 6225.10] I already mentioned it.
[6225.12 → 6225.68] I blame you.
[6225.80 → 6226.38] I already mentioned it.
[6226.52 → 6228.28] I'm just, I'm throwing things at people today.
[6228.38 → 6228.66] Oh, wow.
[6230.56 → 6232.16] No, I'll throw that at the float plane guys.
[6233.34 → 6234.16] He was ready.
[6234.34 → 6235.30] He was ready for it.
[6235.70 → 6236.92] And that's Labs Web.
[6236.92 → 6239.02] So let's talk about behavioural conditioning.
[6239.78 → 6244.24] The reason that everyone started flinching is that even though I joked about throwing
[6244.24 → 6248.02] things at people earlier, I actually did it once.
[6248.28 → 6248.64] Twice.
[6249.04 → 6249.98] I am unpredictable.
[6250.30 → 6251.78] No, you literally threw a thing at me.
[6251.78 → 6252.46] I did throw it twice.
[6252.46 → 6253.64] You actually hit me in the face.
[6253.66 → 6254.88] But I know I threw a dangerous thing once.
[6255.08 → 6259.42] So now when I have the mug, people are like, oh no, he actually might do it.
[6259.42 → 6260.06] He might do it.
[6261.68 → 6262.94] I still think he might.
[6262.94 → 6269.20] Yeah, it doesn't help that you're genuinely very unpredictable sometimes.
[6269.42 → 6270.68] Yeah, I do it on purpose.
[6271.26 → 6273.46] Because if you're predictable, you're boring.
[6273.94 → 6279.50] And my job is to keep people engaged in our content.
[6279.76 → 6285.32] If we made the same video with the same formula every time, we wouldn't have the kind of staying
[6285.32 → 6286.02] power that we do.
[6286.10 → 6286.74] It matters.
[6288.08 → 6288.88] It matters.
[6289.22 → 6289.32] Yeah.
[6289.96 → 6290.54] Yeah, yeah.
[6290.54 → 6295.72] I already bonked my head real bad and have a bump on it yesterday.
[6295.86 → 6296.86] You might as well add another one.
[6296.96 → 6297.64] Just send it.
[6298.92 → 6300.98] I promise I won't sue you.
[6303.48 → 6304.24] What about Dan?
[6304.74 → 6305.52] I'll sue Dan.
[6305.64 → 6307.22] You hit me with that mug, I'll sue Dan.
[6307.22 → 6307.42] What?
[6307.72 → 6309.48] I don't make the rules.
[6309.80 → 6310.36] That's how it works.
[6310.40 → 6312.42] You just want to actually throw something at him.
[6313.18 → 6315.74] Well, I mean, with that throw, you actually just threw it at your monitor.
[6315.74 → 6322.76] I like to think I'm chaotic good, though.
[6323.20 → 6323.76] Oh, yeah.
[6323.82 → 6325.68] They're talking about this in the float plane chat.
[6325.76 → 6328.06] There's too many staff members in the float plane chat tonight.
[6328.18 → 6329.00] It's making me uncomfortable.
[6329.00 → 6330.04] Unquestionably chaotic.
[6330.74 → 6331.68] Good, yeah.
[6332.02 → 6333.48] But unquestionably chaotic.
[6333.86 → 6334.02] Yeah.
[6334.02 → 6338.08] I mean, the way the alignment chart works, though, it's not like a...
[6338.08 → 6338.58] No, you're right.
[6338.66 → 6340.26] Yeah, it doesn't lean more than...
[6340.26 → 6340.38] Yeah.
[6340.48 → 6344.02] Yeah, it's kind of like binary, what you are, right?
[6344.06 → 6347.98] Or can you be slightly good, but definitely chaotic?
[6347.98 → 6349.56] I think in the way that you play your character.
[6349.90 → 6350.24] Yes.
[6350.24 → 6350.56] Okay.
[6351.08 → 6354.34] But when you pick your spot on the chart, I mean, it's pretty...
[6354.34 → 6357.84] When you write down what it is, you're writing down those words, you know?
[6358.02 → 6358.76] So, yeah.
[6358.90 → 6360.76] I would probably say chaotic neutral.
[6361.32 → 6362.88] Yeah, Dan did say do it, coward.
[6363.36 → 6365.00] Yeah, I mean, this is...
[6365.00 → 6365.72] That's not...
[6365.72 → 6366.86] It's literally my fault.
[6367.20 → 6368.08] At that point, yeah.
[6368.26 → 6371.62] I mean, he is the victim, but it's pretty clear we have to blame him.
[6371.72 → 6373.38] Dan is also chaotic, for sure.
[6373.66 → 6374.14] Oh, yeah.
[6374.16 → 6375.58] Oh, Dan's 100% chaotic.
[6375.78 → 6375.96] Yeah.
[6376.20 → 6378.80] Okay, why do we keep not talking about the new merch this week?
[6378.80 → 6379.36] You're not allowed.
[6379.50 → 6379.80] Luke...
[6379.80 → 6382.12] Luke.
[6382.38 → 6382.64] Yes?
[6382.86 → 6383.58] I am allowed.
[6383.86 → 6384.04] No.
[6384.20 → 6385.80] You can't tell...
[6385.80 → 6386.68] Luke.
[6386.84 → 6390.30] U.S. government wants to ban itself from buying sensitive consumer data.
[6390.30 → 6390.78] Dan's...
[6390.78 → 6394.74] A recently declassified report from the Office of the Justice Department of National Intelligence
[6394.74 → 6395.68] Look at the sign.
[6396.76 → 6399.12] We're supposed to do a shorter show this week.
[6399.12 → 6404.78] ...are purchasing large amounts of sensitive data from private vendors as a loophole to acquire
[6404.78 → 6407.22] information that would typically require...
[6407.22 → 6407.30] The Float plane Guys won't help.
[6407.30 → 6409.94] ...and such as approval to obtain.
[6410.66 → 6411.80] They're just sitting there.
[6413.24 → 6415.68] Why do you keep calling them Float plane Guys?
[6416.38 → 6417.00] They're...
[6417.00 → 6417.60] They're...
[6417.60 → 6419.42] This is Labs Web.
[6420.48 → 6422.92] I don't know who works for any company anymore.
[6423.12 → 6427.08] I know they've literally never been here before, but I expect you to know!
[6427.08 → 6429.12] I tried to meet you the other day.
[6429.14 → 6429.44] I'm sorry.
[6430.90 → 6434.26] Anyway, I will continue the topic, I guess.
[6434.90 → 6439.42] Now there is a bipartisan effort in the U.S. House of Representatives to amend the National
[6439.42 → 6445.30] Defence Authorization Act to restrict U.S. military agencies from purchasing data that
[6445.30 → 6448.38] would otherwise require a warrant, court order, or subpoena.
[6448.38 → 6453.90] In a separate effort last week, members of the House Judiciary Committee unanimously voted
[6453.90 → 6458.84] to advance legislation that would place similar restrictions for purchasing data on all levels
[6458.84 → 6460.02] and sectors of government.
[6460.72 → 6461.72] Representatives of the NSA...
[6461.72 → 6463.86] Representatives of the NSA...
[6463.86 → 6464.70] There, I fixed it.
[6464.80 → 6465.78] No, we're done here.
[6466.00 → 6469.28] It's time to talk about the new merch that we have for this week.
[6469.34 → 6471.86] We're going to get to a few merch messages very quickly here.
[6471.98 → 6476.72] We'll go to the Luke Cam, where he is actually rocking one of the new products.
[6476.72 → 6478.10] This is...
[6478.10 → 6478.94] Oh, good lord.
[6479.02 → 6482.18] I don't even know what we call it, but it's really, really comfortable.
[6482.52 → 6485.82] It looks super cool, and it's...
[6485.82 → 6485.98] Ah!
[6486.20 → 6488.50] It's the RGB shirt in gray.
[6488.70 → 6490.84] He actually has the long-sleeve version of it.
[6490.98 → 6494.18] We have a short-sleeve and a long-sleeve version of this.
[6494.68 → 6500.28] It's just as soft and freaking awesome as the light version of it.
[6500.54 → 6502.62] It has the same little...
[6502.62 → 6504.92] They're called news.
[6505.44 → 6506.18] There we go.
[6506.18 → 6508.58] It has the same little multicoloured flex.
[6508.72 → 6509.68] It looks awesome in person.
[6510.42 → 6512.68] Your mic is still not plugged in, Luke.
[6512.70 → 6513.36] It looks awesome in person.
[6513.52 → 6515.02] It's a little hard to tell in photos.
[6515.16 → 6516.28] Yeah, it...
[6516.28 → 6521.48] This is a much better representation of what it looks like at a distance, like, between
[6521.48 → 6522.08] me and Luke.
[6522.10 → 6522.40] Yes.
[6522.62 → 6523.48] Then...
[6523.48 → 6524.10] Ugh, hold on.
[6524.10 → 6527.10] It seems like you'd have to be that close up to see it, but that's not true.
[6527.20 → 6527.90] Not even a little.
[6528.02 → 6530.34] It looks freaking awesome and is super comfortable.
[6530.62 → 6530.76] Yeah.
[6530.76 → 6532.06] And it's, uh...
[6532.06 → 6532.48] What is it?
[6532.56 → 6532.68] Yeah.
[6532.76 → 6533.50] $24.99.
[6533.96 → 6536.54] We don't care how long or short you like your sleeves.
[6536.64 → 6540.80] Either way, it's the same price, because that's how we f***ING roll.
[6541.24 → 6541.54] Yeah.
[6541.54 → 6542.66] Let's go.
[6542.88 → 6543.04] Yeah.
[6543.18 → 6544.20] And in other news...
[6544.20 → 6547.98] So this is an entirely new product, or at least a new variant of an existing product.
[6549.36 → 6554.02] An old classic has finally made a return.
[6554.16 → 6556.96] The indoor hoodie is back, baby!
[6557.32 → 6558.64] In two colours.
[6559.26 → 6561.86] Gray and less gray.
[6565.12 → 6566.46] It's not inaccurate.
[6567.58 → 6572.72] It may not be the most accurate way to say that, but it isn't technically wrong.
[6572.72 → 6574.32] Uh...
[6574.32 → 6574.54] Okay.
[6574.64 → 6575.84] What's happening here?
[6576.44 → 6577.64] Hey, look at that.
[6577.72 → 6578.78] Got all these great pictures.
[6578.92 → 6580.04] Got all these great sizes.
[6580.58 → 6587.00] This took flipping forever, because we had to make it to the same standard of quality as
[6587.00 → 6590.74] the old indoor hoodie, and keep all the things people loved about the old indoor hoodie,
[6590.92 → 6593.64] but we had to go to a new supplier, because the old ones...
[6593.64 → 6597.26] Anyway, we don't use them anymore, and yeah.
[6597.64 → 6598.42] It's back.
[6598.84 → 6600.28] It is beloved.
[6600.28 → 6604.50] It's $49.99, and people...
[6604.50 → 6609.20] We had literally over 3,000 back-in-stock signups for this one.
[6609.64 → 6615.76] And think about the percentage of people that have less of a strong intent to buy, and go
[6615.76 → 6619.18] to a page and just, like, don't bother getting a back-in-stock notification, but they're like,
[6619.22 → 6620.62] yeah, I'll just, like, check back at some point.
[6621.10 → 6621.46] This...
[6621.46 → 6621.70] These...
[6621.70 → 6623.06] Yeah, these things are...
[6623.06 → 6623.26] Yeah.
[6623.36 → 6623.76] ...flying.
[6624.00 → 6624.32] Yeah, yeah.
[6624.32 → 6626.32] All right.
[6626.44 → 6631.50] So, since we now know what people are checking out this week, why don't we do a little merch
[6631.50 → 6631.96] messages?
[6632.82 → 6633.06] No.
[6633.52 → 6634.74] We'll do the merch message in a sec.
[6634.80 → 6637.64] First, let's finish the thing, because that's actually a really important topic.
[6638.16 → 6641.92] The U.S. banning itself from buying sensitive consumer data.
[6642.54 → 6647.48] Representatives of the NSA have apparently reached out to lawmakers, this is great, to express
[6647.48 → 6652.98] concerns about these changes, where they're telling themselves, hey, we're not allowed
[6652.98 → 6660.32] to buy citizen information that would otherwise require a warrant, court order, or subpoena.
[6661.54 → 6666.96] The NSA has admitted to doing this, buying this data from brokers in the past, and its
[6666.96 → 6670.94] lawyers have reportedly created extensive internal guidelines for the collection of commercially
[6670.94 → 6671.70] available data.
[6671.78 → 6673.86] However, some of those rules are classified.
[6673.86 → 6678.82] This is great, because I was always kind of wondering, who is buying all this freaking
[6678.82 → 6679.86] data that everyone's collecting?
[6679.94 → 6680.38] Oh!
[6682.22 → 6683.78] Something that immediately set up...
[6683.78 → 6684.78] Entities with lots of money!
[6685.04 → 6687.46] Something that immediately set up alarm bells for me on this one.
[6687.56 → 6687.76] Yeah.
[6687.94 → 6691.08] Was, could they still just work with another company?
[6693.66 → 6694.26] Um...
[6694.26 → 6699.42] Because, like, what if they didn't buy the data, but they worked with another company that
[6699.42 → 6699.98] bought the data?
[6699.98 → 6703.08] I'd have to hope that they would, you know, try to cover that loophole.
[6703.08 → 6704.08] I feel like this is...
[6704.08 → 6706.96] It's a step in the right direction.
[6706.96 → 6708.30] Have you ever seen American Tax Code?
[6708.42 → 6713.98] Okay, can we just say that at least acknowledging that this is a problem is a step in the right
[6713.98 → 6714.26] direction?
[6714.26 → 6715.82] Yeah, I don't know.
[6715.96 → 6720.80] Between the amount of potential loopholes that I'm kind of sniffing out here, and also
[6720.80 → 6724.66] just, like, if this level of...
[6724.66 → 6730.14] If information that would require a warrant is out there being sold, I feel like there's
[6730.14 → 6732.16] a root issue here that we should solve.
[6732.16 → 6738.32] I mean, there's a lot of information that requires a warrant that is stuff that people
[6738.32 → 6740.20] give away freely on the internet, right?
[6740.30 → 6741.08] Like, it's...
[6741.08 → 6741.38] Yeah.
[6742.08 → 6743.74] But you shouldn't be able to buy it.
[6744.26 → 6745.16] Well...
[6746.16 → 6747.98] I don't know.
[6748.04 → 6750.52] Maybe the more effective way would be to say you can't sell it.
[6750.88 → 6753.20] But then businesses would be unhappy.
[6754.90 → 6755.78] That's not allowed.
[6755.78 → 6759.12] All I'm saying is this is a step in the right direction.
[6759.44 → 6759.66] Yeah.
[6759.66 → 6763.58] At least even saying, hey, this is a problem is something, which is more than we had before.
[6763.66 → 6764.62] I don't disagree.
[6764.86 → 6768.38] I just got a sour taste reading this feeling like I don't think this is going to change
[6768.38 → 6768.78] anything.
[6768.90 → 6769.12] No.
[6769.22 → 6769.88] Even if it goes through.
[6769.98 → 6770.88] You're probably right.
[6771.20 → 6772.16] You're probably right.
[6772.30 → 6773.54] And it feels like one of those things...
[6773.54 → 6776.74] You know, like, the problems with things like security theatre.
[6777.60 → 6780.90] Where, like, it doesn't really solve the problem, but it makes people think that the problem
[6780.90 → 6781.30] is solved.
[6781.50 → 6781.72] Sure.
[6781.84 → 6783.06] Which is kind of a problem.
[6783.16 → 6784.30] It's a problem in and of itself.
[6784.38 → 6784.50] Yep.
[6784.58 → 6784.80] Yeah.
[6785.52 → 6788.22] Using taxpayer dollars to pay for stolen data.
[6788.30 → 6788.86] Yeah, I love it.
[6788.96 → 6789.44] Isn't that great?
[6789.52 → 6790.58] Yeah, it's cute.
[6790.94 → 6791.70] Very awesome.
[6794.00 → 6794.84] Moving on.
[6795.52 → 6796.42] Moving on.
[6796.52 → 6797.86] Is it three merge messages?
[6797.86 → 6801.50] Yeah, that's what we are supposed to be doing for the last, like, 20 minutes.
[6803.06 → 6803.88] Hit me, Dan.
[6804.28 → 6804.96] Oh, man.
[6805.58 → 6810.76] Linus, you seemed nervous for the first bit last WAN show, but quickly seemed to be having
[6810.76 → 6811.20] a blast.
[6811.58 → 6811.98] Okay.
[6812.16 → 6814.16] I saw some comments about this, too.
[6815.00 → 6816.46] I didn't read that at all.
[6816.94 → 6817.94] I thought you were fine.
[6818.30 → 6819.66] I thought I was like...
[6819.66 → 6822.12] I took a few seconds to kind of get into the groove of things.
[6822.12 → 6823.26] See, I thought you did great.
[6823.44 → 6823.68] Oh.
[6823.68 → 6828.18] And I definitely felt a little bit off the whole time, though.
[6828.26 → 6830.46] I didn't feel like it was at the beginning and not at the end.
[6830.64 → 6831.46] A little bit, yeah.
[6831.84 → 6833.02] It's weird doing it live.
[6833.22 → 6835.76] The biggest weird thing for me is we didn't have our monitors.
[6836.00 → 6836.20] Yeah.
[6836.60 → 6837.76] Like, we had the mics.
[6837.94 → 6841.12] Mine didn't fit me at all, so I was trying to force it onto my head the whole time.
[6841.14 → 6841.64] That's hilarious.
[6841.64 → 6847.04] But normally, we can hear ourselves talking, and I can hear him talking through my thing.
[6847.10 → 6848.08] I can hear Dan talking.
[6848.28 → 6851.12] So I know roughly what the stream hears.
[6851.26 → 6851.44] Yeah.
[6852.00 → 6853.50] There, I had no idea.
[6853.50 → 6860.40] And it's really challenging, too, because for the same reason that in-person is much higher
[6860.40 → 6867.00] energy and more dynamic than when we host the show remotely, live, I'd say, is another
[6867.00 → 6873.50] equal step down from remote and just the two of us, because we have known each other a long
[6873.50 → 6873.84] time.
[6874.36 → 6879.54] We read each other pretty well, and we will just step on each other when...
[6879.54 → 6881.38] He's about to ramble.
[6881.38 → 6885.40] He's going to talk about AI for another 15 minutes, and they don't care.
[6886.28 → 6894.50] Or, you know, it would be unfair for me to not give an equal and opposite example.
[6895.50 → 6898.18] He's about to get the entire company destroyed.
[6898.18 → 6901.42] I need to step on this before he continues talking.
[6902.08 → 6902.40] Okay.
[6902.64 → 6903.08] Is that fair?
[6903.08 → 6903.38] Is that fair?
[6903.38 → 6903.96] We good?
[6904.08 → 6904.78] We equal?
[6904.78 → 6904.88] Yeah.
[6905.08 → 6905.44] We're good.
[6905.44 → 6905.74] We're good.
[6905.92 → 6909.42] There's also, like, you notice someone kind of stumbling, so you just catch and keep going.
[6909.50 → 6909.80] Exactly.
[6909.94 → 6916.40] And so we can jump on each other like this, and it's not disruptive to the pacing when we
[6916.40 → 6920.96] don't have to wait for a stream delay, or when we don't have to wait for, you know,
[6921.00 → 6923.92] the audience to have a chance to hear clearly what we're saying.
[6923.92 → 6926.74] Audience laughter, or potentially response, because we would, like, ask a question, which
[6926.74 → 6928.34] normally is just, you know...
[6928.34 → 6929.00] Each other.
[6929.20 → 6929.38] Yeah.
[6929.38 → 6929.78] Or...
[6929.78 → 6929.98] Or...
[6929.98 → 6931.30] And then...
[6931.30 → 6935.78] And then people in the audience would start yelling out answers, which was, like, cool,
[6935.90 → 6936.76] it was just different.
[6936.88 → 6937.46] And delayed.
[6937.72 → 6938.22] And delayed.
[6938.22 → 6941.90] Especially when someone will say something, and then someone else is like, ha ha, I have
[6941.90 → 6943.34] something to add to that as well.
[6943.44 → 6945.92] So it creates this chain reaction, like...
[6945.92 → 6947.64] Which we're not sure that you can hear.
[6947.78 → 6948.12] Yeah.
[6948.94 → 6949.66] It's tough.
[6950.46 → 6951.22] It's tough.
[6951.52 → 6951.74] Yeah.
[6952.94 → 6954.04] But, yeah.
[6954.42 → 6956.68] I mean, it's a perfect energy, though.
[6957.12 → 6958.56] I definitely enjoy it.
[6958.98 → 6964.78] But I don't know if it makes for a better show, is what I'll say.
[6964.78 → 6967.72] I got a lot of comments that people very much enjoyed it live.
[6968.22 → 6968.70] Uh...
[6968.70 → 6972.10] And there were a bunch of comments saying that it was very kind of fun and interesting
[6972.10 → 6974.54] to watch on the GOD.
[6975.00 → 6978.54] But I wouldn't be surprised if retention was, like, a little bit lower.
[6978.74 → 6980.30] I'm gonna check, because now I'm curious.
[6980.54 → 6984.18] But, yeah, it could be one of those things that people think they prefer.
[6984.64 → 6988.50] But then when you look at the overall numbers, most people don't.
[6988.76 → 6988.96] Yeah.
[6990.46 → 6993.48] So, yeah, I mean, we might as well do another merch message while I'm looking this up, because
[6993.48 → 6994.90] I have to get into the...
[6996.02 → 6996.40] Sure.
[6996.72 → 6996.90] Sure.
[6996.90 → 6997.86] This one's for Luke anyway.
[6997.86 → 6998.32] Cool.
[6998.46 → 6998.82] Hey, Luke.
[6998.92 → 7004.28] I've recently found myself falling into a VP of engineering position with my company.
[7004.46 → 7005.08] I mean, lucky.
[7005.18 → 7005.62] Congrats.
[7005.72 → 7006.74] Just fell into it?
[7006.84 → 7007.08] Yeah.
[7007.34 → 7007.66] Man.
[7007.92 → 7009.36] I wouldn't have bothered doing all this.
[7010.28 → 7011.34] Anyway, carry on.
[7011.98 → 7016.92] How have you handled difficult or eccentric personalities in your new role as CTO?
[7017.22 → 7018.10] You tell me, Dan.
[7018.36 → 7018.86] No, I...
[7019.40 → 7020.36] Badly.
[7020.82 → 7021.30] Wow!
[7021.30 → 7024.44] You need some training, bud.
[7024.56 → 7029.58] It's a good thing that that mic is on a stand, because otherwise it would be on the ground.
[7029.58 → 7033.80] Man, I don't know.
[7033.80 → 7038.38] I don't think it's really been all that different from the management that I do in other departments.
[7038.38 → 7046.90] I feel like our entire company kind of attracts a relatively similar type of person.
[7046.90 → 7047.94] You're saying we have a type?
[7048.26 → 7049.06] Yeah, kind of.
[7049.06 → 7049.10] Yeah.
[7049.46 → 7050.38] So, like, yeah.
[7050.46 → 7052.74] I don't think it's been all that different.
[7054.60 → 7056.62] I know it's a very boring answer, but...
[7057.62 → 7057.86] Yeah.
[7058.16 → 7059.52] When you have...
[7059.52 → 7065.54] The type of people that we attract to this company, in my opinion, are very motivated, very curious, very driven.
[7066.70 → 7067.60] A little quirky.
[7067.60 → 7074.94] Maybe distractible, because they're Adding onto every single possible thing all the time, because everything's interesting, and wow, I'm going to do all the stuff.
[7075.50 → 7087.36] So, you know, it's a lot of trying to make sure that people stay focused on the meat and potatoes, the things that we have to get done, but also giving them some time to do the things that are fun so that they stay motivated and driven.
[7087.58 → 7091.52] It's not unusual in the tech space to find people who prefer computers to people.
[7092.34 → 7094.20] Yeah, so sometimes you have to...
[7094.20 → 7095.64] We got the devs nodding.
[7095.64 → 7100.70] Sometimes you have to drag those people out, though, because it's also good.
[7100.98 → 7107.20] And I don't want to force it all the time, but it is good for, like, team unity reasons and all these weird, boring manager things that I can say.
[7107.24 → 7109.86] And sometimes that can make really tough conversations even tougher.
[7110.58 → 7111.98] You know, sometimes it can...
[7111.98 → 7119.10] Actually, this kind of segues us pretty well into a topic that we do have to talk about this week, but we'll do it in a little bit.
[7119.10 → 7130.12] But sometimes it can lead to communication challenges because, you know, we don't really have formal training on, like, you know, how to talk to people.
[7130.36 → 7130.86] Practically anything.
[7131.12 → 7132.06] How to talk to people internally.
[7132.44 → 7134.28] How to talk to people externally.
[7135.84 → 7136.54] How to...
[7136.54 → 7138.10] Yeah, pretty much anything.
[7138.92 → 7140.22] We're working on it, okay?
[7140.30 → 7140.92] We're working on it.
[7140.94 → 7141.40] No, it's true.
[7141.40 → 7147.40] And so, you know, you end up with a really...
[7148.52 → 7151.78] I would say our team is the spice of life, you know?
[7152.16 → 7153.96] There's a ton of variety.
[7154.16 → 7156.40] We don't have any NPCs here.
[7156.64 → 7156.88] No.
[7159.58 → 7160.36] Very true.
[7160.54 → 7160.72] Yeah.
[7160.88 → 7163.68] We have a lot of people who kind of look like NPCs.
[7163.76 → 7168.28] Like, the generic bearded white dude is very overrepresented here.
[7168.46 → 7168.80] Yeah.
[7169.60 → 7169.82] Yeah.
[7169.82 → 7172.92] Dan, you didn't even point the camera to the guy next to you.
[7174.56 → 7175.84] Well, what the...
[7175.84 → 7176.58] Sorry, I don't have to.
[7176.70 → 7177.38] Oh, I get it.
[7177.52 → 7177.94] I get it.
[7177.94 → 7178.44] I get it.
[7178.72 → 7180.46] But you should do it anyway, though.
[7181.72 → 7182.36] What is it?
[7182.40 → 7182.72] This one?
[7183.00 → 7183.22] Yeah.
[7183.32 → 7184.34] Yeah, look.
[7184.44 → 7186.40] More generic bearded white dudes.
[7186.54 → 7187.80] There's four of us in a room.
[7188.20 → 7188.56] Fantastic.
[7188.56 → 7188.96] Amazing.
[7188.96 → 7189.26] And it's a podcast.
[7189.26 → 7190.10] And it's a podcast.
[7191.62 → 7192.76] The white perspective.
[7193.24 → 7193.48] Oh.
[7194.34 → 7194.66] Oh.
[7195.80 → 7196.20] Oh.
[7196.58 → 7196.94] Okay.
[7197.28 → 7198.22] What were we talking about?
[7198.22 → 7201.06] Let's do literally anything else other than this.
[7203.52 → 7205.50] No, I'm just not going to say anything.
[7206.56 → 7207.36] Just going to leave it.
[7207.36 → 7209.24] I'm going to leave it hanging right there.
[7209.30 → 7209.96] Anyway, yeah.
[7210.24 → 7211.84] Management stuff really didn't change much.
[7212.80 → 7218.76] Same type of people in, you know, interests and skill sets and stuff like that.
[7218.76 → 7220.92] Just focused on different things.
[7221.62 → 7222.38] And it's been good.
[7223.18 → 7225.34] Next merch message, please.
[7225.50 → 7225.88] Yes, sir.
[7225.98 → 7226.12] Thank you.
[7226.12 → 7227.36] Give me something controversial, Dan.
[7227.98 → 7228.34] Oh.
[7229.26 → 7230.66] Let's make him squirm.
[7231.34 → 7231.72] Okay.
[7232.28 → 7234.92] Was LTX as successful as you had hoped?
[7236.00 → 7236.88] There you go.
[7236.88 → 7238.14] I don't know.
[7239.22 → 7241.88] That is the real honest to goodness answer.
[7242.00 → 7244.92] I have the revenue numbers, but I don't have any of the expenses.
[7245.72 → 7249.90] So there's more revenue than I expected.
[7250.52 → 7254.70] But what I do know about the expenses, even if I don't have any numbers for them, is that
[7254.70 → 7256.14] they were more than we expected.
[7256.80 → 7257.76] How much more?
[7258.54 → 7259.28] Don't know.
[7259.28 → 7266.12] However, I will say that aside from the business side of things, which is very important, which
[7266.12 → 7271.28] is critical, like that determines whether we can continue to do it.
[7271.84 → 7274.86] The community side was absolutely incredible.
[7275.08 → 7281.78] Other than a couple of cranky posts the first day that I'm not saying the crankiness was illegitimate.
[7282.26 → 7283.52] I'm just saying it was present.
[7283.52 → 7288.94] Other than a couple of cranky posts the first day, the community reaction from creators and
[7288.94 → 7295.86] from viewers and from our vendors, like our commercial partners there, has been overwhelmingly
[7295.86 → 7296.60] positive.
[7296.74 → 7301.94] Pretty much every major brand that participated that has talked to us about it at all has
[7301.94 → 7304.52] said, we want to double down for next year.
[7304.68 → 7310.60] We are already thinking about budgets for 2024 and how we can come back way bigger because
[7310.60 → 7313.36] the vibe is just...
[7313.36 → 7314.22] Oh, it was immaculate.
[7314.40 → 7316.30] Totally different from any other show.
[7316.42 → 7317.56] And that is by design.
[7317.70 → 7319.92] You remember the original pitch for this?
[7320.00 → 7321.26] I shouldn't say the original pitch.
[7321.32 → 7326.56] I should say, because 17 was supposed to be just like a meetup to serve the purpose of
[7326.56 → 7326.96] meetups.
[7327.16 → 7327.34] Yeah.
[7327.46 → 7329.52] So that we just like don't have to do them anymore.
[7329.68 → 7331.48] Do you remember what I called 18?
[7332.36 → 7333.80] It's been a long time.
[7333.86 → 7335.20] I called it a carnival.
[7335.84 → 7336.16] Yes.
[7336.34 → 7336.56] Yeah.
[7336.56 → 7337.10] I remember that.
[7337.32 → 7339.56] And that was why we had like bouncy games.
[7340.36 → 7341.68] And that was why we had...
[7341.68 → 7343.42] 17 had games as well.
[7343.54 → 7345.26] I think you were calling it carnival back at 17.
[7345.26 → 7345.46] Was I?
[7345.62 → 7345.86] Okay.
[7345.98 → 7348.64] Because it had like the bungee rope running game.
[7348.90 → 7349.76] Did 17 have that?
[7349.82 → 7350.32] Are you sure?
[7350.64 → 7350.84] Yep.
[7351.18 → 7352.80] Because that was at the Langley Event Centre.
[7352.86 → 7353.06] Okay.
[7353.06 → 7353.94] I have photos of it.
[7354.02 → 7354.54] So fine.
[7354.54 → 7358.08] Originally then, it was a carnival.
[7358.36 → 7358.50] Yeah.
[7358.60 → 7363.88] So it's a convention slash, but there has to be engaging stuff to do.
[7364.00 → 7368.38] And we drilled that into the brand partners.
[7368.38 → 7370.48] Because if you leave a brand partner...
[7370.48 → 7370.96] I strongly believe in that.
[7370.96 → 7376.02] ...to design their booth, they will have a little table with a tablecloth, and they will
[7376.02 → 7379.00] put their product on it, and they will sit there, and they will wait for people to ask
[7379.00 → 7379.84] them about their product.
[7379.84 → 7381.58] Or you get the like...
[7381.58 → 7381.70] Oh!
[7382.88 → 7383.84] Not to...
[7383.84 → 7386.76] I've lovingly gone to PAX for many years.
[7387.06 → 7388.38] And not to dog PAX.
[7388.50 → 7393.72] But something that happens there decently often is you'll get this massive booth from
[7393.72 → 7400.54] this massive game publisher that is used entirely as hopefully it's cushy, comfy carpet land.
[7400.68 → 7405.42] Because there's just like TVs playing YouTube trailers of their games and nothing else.
[7405.56 → 7405.72] Yeah.
[7405.84 → 7408.34] It's like, man, why did you even show up?
[7408.34 → 7415.82] So we told brands, look, as cool and chill as it is that you want to give us money to
[7415.82 → 7419.46] be here, that is actually not your primary main objective.
[7419.92 → 7423.32] Your primary main objective is to be interesting.
[7424.00 → 7428.48] Is to have an activation that people can actively participate in.
[7428.98 → 7429.54] Sorry.
[7429.54 → 7434.64] So that we have stuff for people to do.
[7435.92 → 7439.18] And so we were like, look, we're flexible about it.
[7439.50 → 7443.60] It can be as on topic or as off-topic as you want.
[7443.84 → 7447.84] So like VESA was there, and they had, can you spot the difference?
[7448.34 → 7450.16] Like HDR versus not HDR.
[7450.58 → 7454.66] And we had Brandon from the lab there to talk people through, you know, what they were seeing.
[7454.66 → 7461.08] Uh, Ari had a cool setup where you could like to operate a fricking, you know, $80,000 camera
[7461.08 → 7465.50] or whatever that rig was actually probably, that lens was probably worth $80,000.
[7466.10 → 7471.22] Um, and I forget you, I forget if you could film something or like, we, uh, we had a thumbnail
[7471.22 → 7473.88] booth where people could take assets and create their own thumbnail.
[7474.02 → 7480.44] So we wanted things that people could sit down and, and do and, and be doing.
[7480.54 → 7481.98] We don't want people walking around.
[7481.98 → 7484.54] We want people doing stuff.
[7484.68 → 7487.00] We want them doing stuff with other members of the community.
[7487.48 → 7491.84] And most of the brands kind of got it, um, this year.
[7492.48 → 7496.74] Next year, we are going to draw a much firmer line in the sand.
[7497.08 → 7501.42] If you don't have something cool to do in your booth, you are not f***ING coming.
[7501.86 → 7502.58] That simple.
[7502.96 → 7503.82] If next year happens.
[7503.98 → 7506.72] If next year happens, which is not confirmed because business things.
[7507.00 → 7507.18] Yeah.
[7507.18 → 7515.86] Um, and I'd say, I'd say that in terms of getting closer to what, uh, my vision for the, for the event
[7515.86 → 7521.26] was, this year was a big step-up, and I got to give major kudos to the team because I actually
[7521.26 → 7525.16] gave them far less guidance this year than I had in previous years.
[7525.16 → 7530.32] And we ended up with something that was far closer to what I wanted than previous years.
[7530.32 → 7532.48] So they had just nailed it.
[7532.84 → 7538.62] Um, there are certain things that I probably could have told them should have been done
[7538.62 → 7539.18] a different way.
[7539.18 → 7543.72] There were a few things that like, uh, not to dog on them, but there were a few things that
[7543.72 → 7546.00] like, uh, if 2019 was last year.
[7546.58 → 7548.16] We wouldn't have made that mistake.
[7548.90 → 7549.16] Yeah.
[7549.16 → 7549.28] Yeah.
[7549.46 → 7552.46] Because it's, it's some of that, like, you know, top of mind type of problems.
[7552.46 → 7553.44] It's not just us.
[7553.54 → 7554.32] Like the line management.
[7554.32 → 7555.38] Oh, I completely believe it.
[7555.38 → 7558.92] The line management on the first day, our spec was way better than what got laid out.
[7559.18 → 7559.30] Yeah.
[7559.60 → 7560.32] Everybody's rusty.
[7560.84 → 7561.02] Yeah.
[7561.10 → 7564.88] The whole convention industry was like off for three years.
[7564.88 → 7569.42] There was communication to, to at least me that the event staff at the convention had
[7569.42 → 7570.44] been laid off during COVID.
[7570.62 → 7576.18] And it is a lot of very, you know, new hires that are not super experienced with cons with
[7576.18 → 7579.24] that level of enthusiastic attendance.
[7579.48 → 7583.04] A lot of conventions that show up, it's like industry events and stuff like that.
[7583.22 → 7583.98] Routine industry stuff.
[7584.10 → 7585.26] People are just kind of cruising around.
[7585.36 → 7588.18] This was like, you know, a very hype event.
[7588.28 → 7588.46] Yeah.
[7588.52 → 7590.36] And there's a, um, different type of management.
[7590.36 → 7595.56] There's like a, uh, man, even attendees, I feel like kind of bunged it up in a certain
[7595.56 → 7595.84] way.
[7596.12 → 7601.40] Like I went through the line for the build it yourself screwdriver at the beginning of the
[7601.40 → 7601.96] first day.
[7602.26 → 7602.54] Yeah.
[7602.74 → 7606.04] And I walked through and went to, to a number of people.
[7606.04 → 7607.96] I was like, this is a really long line.
[7608.26 → 7609.22] There are lots.
[7610.08 → 7612.10] You should go do something else right now.
[7612.76 → 7614.56] And none of them left.
[7614.72 → 7616.10] They all just stayed in the line.
[7616.14 → 7616.76] And I get it.
[7616.96 → 7617.96] I actually get it.
[7617.96 → 7619.34] Cause you, you want to get it right away.
[7619.34 → 7621.90] So like you can get it signed by people or, or whatever, right?
[7621.90 → 7622.60] Like I get it.
[7622.96 → 7626.72] But also, you know, a lot of the complaints we got were about how long that line was.
[7626.76 → 7630.56] I'm like, ah, but yeah, but if no matter how many things there are to do in the hall,
[7630.56 → 7634.92] if everybody just goes to the same thing first and then immediately goes up and lines
[7634.92 → 7635.72] up for the next thing.
[7635.80 → 7638.22] Second, there were things we could have meant.
[7638.42 → 7640.22] We could have processed the line faster.
[7640.34 → 7641.74] Same with like, oh man, pickups.
[7641.88 → 7646.96] We, we didn't even find out that the convention centre had a special Wi-Fi network.
[7647.48 → 7652.28] That's like more stable for POS terminals until late in the first day.
[7652.28 → 7652.68] Yeah.
[7652.82 → 7654.46] That would have saved us so much time.
[7654.46 → 7656.24] It would have been pretty sick if they told us that.
[7656.34 → 7658.54] I am not blaming the community for anything.
[7658.78 → 7662.58] We, we play our own part, but also I just think people are just kind of a little rusty
[7662.58 → 7666.86] about how to min max this stuff from the convention centre side, from our side, from
[7666.86 → 7668.68] the brand side, from the attendee side.
[7668.74 → 7672.28] Like everyone's just like, yeah, we got to get somewhere to go again.
[7672.66 → 7673.06] Yeah.
[7673.30 → 7679.10] My, my group that goes down to PAX, we used to like plan stuff out quite specifically around
[7679.10 → 7681.06] to like line timings and all this kind of stuff.
[7681.20 → 7682.48] So it is what it is.
[7682.64 → 7682.66] Yeah.
[7682.66 → 7684.70] Gas in float plane chat says, yeah, it's been rough.
[7684.80 → 7688.20] Our community just, our, our company just did our first convention since pre COVID.
[7688.42 → 7690.32] And I could tell we were all rusty.
[7690.50 → 7693.40] I mean, at least you guys still have the team, right?
[7693.40 → 7695.96] Like, yeah, at least we still have our team.
[7696.02 → 7698.14] It would be really hard if we just had all new people.
[7698.28 → 7698.66] Yeah.
[7699.12 → 7701.52] I would have had to micromanage the bloody thing.
[7702.96 → 7705.32] Something that I really, really didn't like.
[7705.82 → 7708.68] Um, and I know this is like different people have different opinions on this.
[7709.12 → 7714.26] Um, and I'm not judging anyone else's opinion on this, but for me, when there were the meetups,
[7714.26 → 7721.44] like the official scheduled meetups, when the time got down to 15 seconds, like, why are
[7721.44 → 7721.96] we even here?
[7721.96 → 7724.60] Well, actually, no, I'm going to counter that argument.
[7725.00 → 7730.64] I think that for next year with high volume meet and greet people, we should actually have
[7730.64 → 7731.78] multiple lines.
[7732.46 → 7738.08] So we should have like a literal selfie only line where people basically get.
[7738.08 → 7740.00] Like they hand someone their phone.
[7740.08 → 7742.50] They go in, get the hell out of here.
[7742.68 → 7743.02] This is the.
[7743.38 → 7743.92] Whoop, whoop.
[7744.24 → 7747.10] And so on and so forth because, oh, sorry.
[7747.44 → 7747.70] Go ahead.
[7748.12 → 7750.08] No, this is the other kind of problem too.
[7750.08 → 7750.44] Yeah.
[7750.44 → 7757.54] Is you need the person that's like doing the line management to be very like outgoing and
[7757.54 → 7758.00] on it.
[7758.10 → 7759.30] And everyone was new this year.
[7759.38 → 7761.84] Because the 100% and I'm not, I'm not dogging on anyone.
[7761.98 → 7762.74] I appreciate the help.
[7762.82 → 7763.60] There are a lot of volunteers.
[7763.80 → 7766.00] It would have not worked at all without you.
[7766.06 → 7767.12] So I'm not digging there.
[7767.12 → 7770.92] But like there would be times I have to like shout out to everyone in line.
[7771.02 → 7771.74] Like, please.
[7772.16 → 7773.52] It's a 15-second timer.
[7773.92 → 7775.02] Have your phone out and ready.
[7775.16 → 7776.48] Have the thing you want to sign ready.
[7776.74 → 7777.78] Let's do this like movement.
[7777.88 → 7780.28] So my idea was put the thing you want to sign on the table.
[7780.78 → 7780.90] Yeah.
[7780.96 → 7783.00] After you've handed off your phone, line up for photo.
[7783.14 → 7784.72] I immediately go to sign the thing afterwards.
[7784.90 → 7785.82] Ask me a question.
[7786.30 → 7786.48] Whatever.
[7786.90 → 7787.08] Or don't.
[7787.16 → 7787.60] Or don't.
[7787.66 → 7789.10] And then we fire off.
[7789.10 → 7793.24] But then we'd waste the entire, more than the entire time window sometimes just having
[7793.24 → 7795.94] people pull their, pull their phones out, get signed in.
[7796.06 → 7796.72] Oh, sorry.
[7796.82 → 7798.04] I'm not on the right.
[7798.14 → 7799.72] Oh, I can take that picture for you.
[7799.88 → 7801.14] Oh, thank you so much.
[7801.80 → 7803.10] And then the timer's at zero.
[7803.26 → 7804.48] And then, oh, wait, it's on the wrong.
[7804.54 → 7805.60] Oh, I'm not familiar with your app.
[7805.68 → 7807.98] Oh, now I have to change the camera because you were going to take a selfie.
[7808.30 → 7808.62] Okay.
[7808.78 → 7809.08] Okay.
[7809.26 → 7809.90] Click, click, click.
[7810.14 → 7810.54] Horizontal.
[7811.12 → 7811.78] Click, click, click.
[7811.84 → 7812.14] Vertical.
[7812.44 → 7812.80] No.
[7813.68 → 7816.66] There's literally 80 people in line behind you.
[7816.72 → 7817.58] Take one picture.
[7817.84 → 7818.58] And I'm not.
[7819.10 → 7820.02] Like, I get it.
[7820.08 → 7820.82] I get it.
[7820.84 → 7821.74] I felt terrible.
[7821.88 → 7822.04] There was.
[7822.12 → 7824.08] But it's all the other people too, right?
[7824.12 → 7827.02] Like, it's not that I don't want to spend the next nine minutes with you.
[7827.10 → 7829.32] I would actually, I would actually love that.
[7829.42 → 7830.74] I would love to have one longer conversation.
[7830.74 → 7832.12] A lot of the interactions with LTX were fantastic.
[7832.30 → 7837.98] I'd love to have one longer conversation compared to a hundred meaningless short ones.
[7838.18 → 7838.36] Yeah.
[7838.36 → 7842.64] But you got to also understand a lot of people are just there to get a selfie or to get something
[7842.64 → 7846.96] signed to, to, you know, collect all the signatures on their GPU or whatever.
[7846.96 → 7852.74] So what I think I'm going to propose for next year is we have a meetup line where you actually
[7852.74 → 7857.72] get at least 30 seconds to 45 seconds or a minute or whatever it is.
[7857.78 → 7861.14] And then you have an express line for just signing a thing.
[7861.24 → 7866.38] You have an express line for just taking a picture because they, my first day, they
[7866.38 → 7867.78] didn't cut off my line.
[7867.78 → 7873.82] So I got to the end of my time when I actually needed to leave because I was at a prior commitment
[7873.82 → 7876.10] and there was a huge line left.
[7876.28 → 7878.94] And so I basically went, okay, I have three minutes left.
[7879.00 → 7879.56] What can I do?
[7879.58 → 7884.26] And I was like, all right, everybody get your phones out now.
[7884.50 → 7885.36] No phone out.
[7885.52 → 7886.90] You're not in selfie camera mode.
[7886.98 → 7887.92] I can't stop.
[7888.24 → 7890.06] I'm going to walk through the line.
[7890.06 → 7894.00] And so I basically just walked through the line.
[7894.08 → 7894.56] That's a good idea.
[7894.68 → 7897.26] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[7897.32 → 7902.68] So I managed to hit like 40 to 60 people in like five minutes.
[7902.92 → 7907.20] And so, and for, for a lot of them, yeah, they wanted to chit-chat, and I'm sorry.
[7907.28 → 7908.12] That feels bad.
[7908.32 → 7908.46] Yeah.
[7908.58 → 7913.10] But if we could separate out the people who want to chit-chat from the people who actually
[7913.10 → 7917.88] did just want to get a picture, then we could process way more people, way more efficiently.
[7917.88 → 7921.10] So I just, it's little things like that, that I'd like to figure out how to do better.
[7924.58 → 7924.90] Yeah.
[7926.08 → 7927.94] Um, oh, have we still.
[7928.14 → 7931.32] It feels bad too when like, when you get into the rush, it's when you get to the back of
[7931.32 → 7931.70] the line.
[7931.84 → 7933.84] So it's a lot of people that have been waiting the longest.
[7934.14 → 7934.46] Yeah.
[7934.62 → 7938.32] And then you're like, oh, well, I'm completely out of time and I have to churn through this.
[7938.34 → 7939.80] So you have like five seconds.
[7940.18 → 7940.50] Sorry.
[7940.66 → 7941.18] You just waited.
[7941.52 → 7941.80] Yeah.
[7941.96 → 7942.20] I don't know.
[7942.30 → 7943.52] You waited for half an hour or whatever.
[7943.52 → 7946.78] Like I always feel, I hate wasting anybody's time.
[7946.78 → 7952.08] One thing that I actually found pretty good success with was when I would just like not
[7952.08 → 7955.44] be scheduled for something, and I'll just randomly have a line form.
[7956.04 → 7959.64] When I would know that I would need to leave soon, I'd tell the person at the front of the
[7959.64 → 7960.80] line, like, just wait a second.
[7960.94 → 7965.72] And I'd walk to the back and I would deputize whoever would be willing to not let anyone
[7965.72 → 7969.08] else in the line and then just get through the queue and then take off.
[7969.16 → 7969.32] Yeah.
[7969.34 → 7970.94] I found that did not work for me.
[7971.06 → 7971.88] Oh, it did for me.
[7971.88 → 7975.94] Luckily, I only ended up doing it twice because I only thought of it too late.
[7976.08 → 7979.98] The first person that I deputized was by profession, a security guard.
[7980.80 → 7981.12] Hilarious.
[7981.62 → 7983.80] So it just like was perfect.
[7984.10 → 7985.80] I was like, wow, this works really well.
[7985.86 → 7986.60] And then I tried to do it again.
[7986.64 → 7989.42] It didn't work, you know, quite as well, but it still sort of worked.
[7989.62 → 7989.82] Yeah.
[7990.36 → 7991.64] Didn't do anything for me.
[7991.68 → 7995.38] And I even had Sherwood following me around the whole time, just like shepherding me to
[7995.38 → 7996.42] where I was supposed to go.
[7996.42 → 8001.70] But like people will ask anyway, and I always just feel terrible if I don't.
[8001.78 → 8004.06] Do you do the like if you can keep up thing?
[8004.18 → 8004.50] Yeah, I do.
[8004.66 → 8004.90] Okay.
[8004.98 → 8005.34] I do that.
[8005.40 → 8005.60] Yeah.
[8005.94 → 8007.04] Can you sign something?
[8007.12 → 8007.52] I don't know.
[8007.60 → 8008.38] Can you walk fast?
[8008.50 → 8008.68] Yeah.
[8009.58 → 8015.86] And what I find is that if I am actively signing something for someone and moving, people get
[8015.86 → 8017.98] the hint that I am actually busy.
[8018.36 → 8022.90] I had Dennis, I think, was telling me, oh, I do the like on my phone thing and I walk really
[8022.90 → 8023.20] fast.
[8023.26 → 8025.02] I'm like, that does not work for me at all.
[8025.02 → 8027.62] No, people will interrupt me anyway.
[8027.74 → 8029.98] I didn't know there was like a more staff area bathroom.
[8030.86 → 8031.14] Yeah.
[8031.36 → 8032.12] So twice.
[8032.28 → 8033.34] I found that really early on.
[8033.40 → 8033.74] It was great.
[8033.98 → 8035.98] Meet and greets start in the bathroom.
[8036.12 → 8036.52] Yeah.
[8037.20 → 8037.94] That was a little weird.
[8038.60 → 8038.98] Yeah.
[8039.00 → 8039.86] Don't do that.
[8040.04 → 8040.16] Yeah.
[8040.16 → 8041.86] I would request to not in the future.
[8042.06 → 8042.18] Yeah.
[8042.28 → 8042.52] Great.
[8042.76 → 8047.66] Because you got to understand, like, we have a really hard time saying no because we know
[8047.66 → 8051.12] it's why you're there, and it's kind of why we're there too.
[8051.12 → 8054.02] Not why we're in the bathroom, but it's why we're in the building.
[8054.02 → 8055.02] Yeah.
[8055.74 → 8060.54] But yeah, overall, there's a lot of stuff that I think that we could do better.
[8061.36 → 8061.90] And I think that...
[8061.90 → 8062.92] And it was a great show.
[8063.30 → 8063.56] Yes.
[8063.64 → 8065.68] And that combination is actually great.
[8065.70 → 8065.96] Yes.
[8066.06 → 8066.98] And the community was...
[8066.98 → 8067.72] It's a perfect spot to be in.
[8067.92 → 8068.32] Amazing.
[8068.52 → 8074.34] Everything that we're saying right now, even if we're like, hey, you know, it's all...
[8074.34 → 8074.78] We all...
[8074.78 → 8075.58] Super positive.
[8075.66 → 8078.12] We know it comes from a perfect place.
[8078.12 → 8078.48] Oh, yeah.
[8078.76 → 8080.16] We get it.
[8080.20 → 8085.40] Which is why we feel bad for not, you know, doing it.
[8085.44 → 8085.56] Yeah.
[8085.56 → 8087.38] Because we know that you guys are cool and...
[8087.38 → 8088.82] There's no negativity in that action.
[8088.88 → 8089.10] Yeah.
[8089.28 → 8090.28] They're just excited.
[8090.48 → 8090.72] Yeah.
[8090.78 → 8091.66] Which is great.
[8091.88 → 8092.74] Like, I don't know.
[8092.84 → 8093.12] Yeah.
[8093.58 → 8095.16] It's just also awkward.
[8095.38 → 8096.50] It's like standing at a urinal.
[8096.68 → 8099.06] It's like, hey, do you want to sign my d***, right?
[8099.14 → 8100.02] Like, it's...
[8100.02 → 8100.56] You want me to sign it?
[8100.60 → 8102.28] Can you hold that for a second?
[8104.82 → 8105.18] Yeah.
[8105.70 → 8109.14] While we're on the topic, do you guys want some ice cream?
[8110.76 → 8111.34] Oh, yeah.
[8111.36 → 8113.68] That was kind of a thing that happened at LTX.
[8113.76 → 8113.98] Sure.
[8114.10 → 8114.70] I guess so.
[8114.78 → 8114.96] Yeah.
[8115.06 → 8119.06] So, I don't even remember the context or why I brought it up at all.
[8119.50 → 8119.82] Yeah.
[8120.12 → 8120.90] Can you do that, too?
[8121.02 → 8121.50] He's on it.
[8122.40 → 8123.16] Arming the building.
[8123.16 → 8129.04] On some previous WAN show, I mentioned that fruit roll-ups, if you put ice cream in
[8129.04 → 8130.00] them, you get the really crunchy.
[8130.20 → 8131.94] I have no idea why I mentioned this on the show.
[8132.10 → 8132.60] I don't either.
[8132.70 → 8133.26] I don't remember.
[8133.46 → 8133.80] Me neither.
[8133.98 → 8134.80] But I did.
[8135.22 → 8139.50] And one of the whales that came up brought a 72-pack or something.
[8139.64 → 8140.22] It's right there.
[8140.24 → 8140.38] Yeah.
[8140.38 → 8141.20] Of fruit roll-ups.
[8141.54 → 8142.32] Of fruit roll-ups.
[8142.74 → 8146.04] So, the WAN show writer, Jessica, has prepared us...
[8146.82 → 8148.62] Fruit roll-ups and ice cream, I guess.
[8148.84 → 8149.10] I guess.
[8149.10 → 8151.02] Is there ice cream or are we just eating fruit roll-ups?
[8151.02 → 8152.74] I think it's an ice cream.
[8152.84 → 8153.10] Okay.
[8153.22 → 8154.14] Because I've never tried it.
[8154.38 → 8155.10] Neither have I.
[8155.10 → 8159.84] And this might be the most boring part of the WAN show we've ever had.
[8159.98 → 8161.08] Or it might be interesting.
[8161.20 → 8162.08] Or it might be interesting.
[8162.36 → 8162.60] Yeah.
[8162.82 → 8165.08] You claimed I would be interested in it.
[8165.28 → 8165.60] Did I?
[8165.78 → 8166.16] You did.
[8166.20 → 8168.54] You said it's, like, surprisingly crunchy.
[8168.82 → 8169.28] Oh, it is.
[8169.48 → 8171.08] But I don't know if that's, like, WAN show interesting.
[8171.24 → 8171.84] I don't know.
[8171.84 → 8172.44] I don't know either.
[8172.48 → 8173.50] And I know you like ice cream.
[8173.58 → 8175.22] I don't know what WAN show even is.
[8175.28 → 8176.92] Do you know how many topics we've done this week?
[8176.92 → 8177.96] I have no idea.
[8178.04 → 8178.28] Like, three.
[8178.76 → 8184.64] We started it by talking about Baldur's Gate with no actual reason for the topic.
[8185.20 → 8185.94] Well, no.
[8186.04 → 8190.44] The reason for the topic was you and Dan and chat were talking about it in the pre-show.
[8190.50 → 8192.62] And I was like, this is fascinating.
[8192.88 → 8194.52] Guys, just do this during the show.
[8194.70 → 8198.28] And then I kicked off the conversation in the show and you guys were all just like...
[8199.60 → 8204.42] Well, my whole thing is that on pre-shows I just talk about video games.
[8204.64 → 8204.98] Okay.
[8205.12 → 8205.82] What is this?
[8205.82 → 8208.90] We have what appear to be fruit roll-up ice cream pierogies.
[8208.90 → 8210.26] Wait, that's my old bowl.
[8211.18 → 8211.90] Yes, it is.
[8212.26 → 8215.06] This is the bowl that you decorated on Channel Super Fun.
[8215.18 → 8217.16] You can tell because it has two L's on it.
[8219.66 → 8220.06] Yes.
[8220.22 → 8221.18] That's really random.
[8221.40 → 8221.66] Yeah, yeah.
[8221.72 → 8223.32] I thought that was, like, gone-gone.
[8225.20 → 8225.74] Is it, like, stuck in there?
[8225.74 → 8226.06] No, no.
[8226.40 → 8227.70] That's a Taken character.
[8229.52 → 8230.38] You're confused.
[8231.14 → 8232.46] No, I think it's just gone.
[8232.54 → 8233.94] I don't know if it's supposed to sit in the fridge.
[8235.00 → 8235.74] Oh, you got it.
[8235.82 → 8236.76] Freezer, you mean, I think.
[8236.90 → 8237.20] But sure.
[8237.20 → 8239.10] We have a bunch if you guys want some.
[8241.72 → 8242.88] Hold on a second.
[8242.96 → 8243.18] Oh, wait.
[8243.22 → 8243.76] Should I be waiting?
[8244.28 → 8244.72] I'll wait.
[8244.80 → 8245.42] I'll wait for you.
[8246.12 → 8247.32] Oh, there's a rainbow one.
[8247.38 → 8248.22] I didn't look that closely.
[8248.38 → 8249.00] Yeah, noob.
[8249.06 → 8249.74] Now I'm disappointed.
[8250.62 → 8251.66] The rainbow one is so delicious.
[8251.66 → 8252.58] Well, they're, like, kind of melting.
[8252.70 → 8253.52] So I guess we should go.
[8253.64 → 8253.92] Okay.
[8253.92 → 8254.92] I guess we'll just...
[8254.92 → 8271.42] That is wildly less interesting than I expected.
[8271.42 → 8277.28] It is a weird kind of crunchy.
[8277.80 → 8278.12] Mm-hmm.
[8278.80 → 8282.54] Like, it's not hard, hard, like, ah, my teeth, like I kind of expected.
[8282.54 → 8285.30] In the videos, it sounded like someone bit into, like, a stack of chips.
[8294.96 → 8297.48] And it is weird the way that it starts out...
[8297.48 → 8298.98] I wouldn't describe it as crunchy.
[8299.06 → 8299.66] It's more crispy.
[8300.60 → 8302.98] It starts out crispy...
[8302.98 → 8304.92] And then gets really chewy.
[8305.20 → 8309.54] There's no way that I'm eating the whole thing, because I'm pretty sure this is about 4,000 calories, but...
[8314.22 → 8316.06] Yeah, can we, like, have the bowl back?
[8316.22 → 8317.76] I will have one more bite, though.
[8319.08 → 8320.98] I'm saying one more bite is calorie-worthy.
[8325.48 → 8326.70] Dan doesn't like it, I think.
[8328.66 → 8329.84] Is it a little much for you, Dan?
[8330.54 → 8331.38] That's very strange.
[8332.98 → 8336.98] I don't like it.
[8337.32 → 8337.84] Mm-hmm.
[8339.70 → 8340.02] Yeah.
[8341.88 → 8344.50] I think that's just how fruit roll-ups work, to be honest.
[8344.62 → 8344.88] Here you go.
[8345.26 → 8345.58] Thank you.
[8346.82 → 8347.24] All right.
[8347.44 → 8348.26] Okay, well, that happened.
[8348.40 → 8352.06] It was a lot less interesting than it is in the video that I saw.
[8352.84 → 8354.00] Because when I see it, it's like...
[8354.00 → 8355.24] Yeah.
[8355.34 → 8356.08] It did sound like that.
[8356.76 → 8357.14] Oh, yeah.
[8357.20 → 8358.46] Oh, it sounded like that in the mic.
[8358.56 → 8359.50] Mine kind of felt like that.
[8359.76 → 8360.52] Mine didn't.
[8360.92 → 8361.14] Oh.
[8361.14 → 8363.12] Maybe yours, like, warmed up or something, then.
[8363.20 → 8363.56] I don't know.
[8364.18 → 8367.00] Like, I was keeping my fingers off the like, the coldest part of it.
[8367.06 → 8368.42] Like, I was trying to not warm it up.
[8368.56 → 8370.18] Yeah, I tried to only pinch, like, a corner.
[8370.32 → 8370.62] All right.
[8371.26 → 8371.64] It just...
[8371.64 → 8372.02] I just...
[8372.02 → 8372.38] I don't know.
[8372.50 → 8373.32] I don't know if mine really worked.
[8373.34 → 8374.96] We did have strawberry ice cream in it.
[8375.04 → 8375.36] Night wheel.
[8375.88 → 8377.16] That was strawberry ice cream.
[8377.28 → 8378.82] Apparently that's, like, the way to do it.
[8378.98 → 8380.44] I'm happy that I've tried it.
[8380.56 → 8381.20] That was cool.
[8381.36 → 8382.68] Thank you for bringing the fruit roll-ups.
[8382.78 → 8383.00] Yeah.
[8383.00 → 8383.60] Um...
[8383.60 → 8387.08] My kids will enjoy the rest of those fruit roll-ups because there's no way Luke wants them.
[8387.20 → 8387.42] Nope.
[8389.34 → 8390.30] And we're moving on.
[8390.74 → 8391.20] All right.
[8391.52 → 8393.12] Uh, should we do some topics?
[8393.28 → 8396.32] Like, Kenya suspends Worldcoin eye scanning?
[8396.54 → 8397.24] Should we do this thing?
[8398.02 → 8398.76] Oh, right.
[8398.80 → 8399.52] We should do that.
[8399.60 → 8399.74] No.
[8399.86 → 8407.42] First, let's talk about the, uh, controversy that came up this week over a, uh, Labs tour video.
[8407.42 → 8410.38] Uh, a summary for the people who aren't aware.
[8410.78 → 8416.06] Uh, someone who was here for a tour prior to LTX uploaded a video of their tour, which included
[8416.06 → 8420.68] Tim from our Labs team, uh, who had been asked several times throughout the day about how our
[8420.68 → 8425.30] testing is different from our peers in the industry, like Gamers Nexus and Hardware Unboxed.
[8425.50 → 8430.66] He therefore proactively in this tour, which was later in the day, made a direct comparison
[8430.66 → 8435.74] to them when talking about how we run our tests every time we do a new video.
[8435.74 → 8440.54] Um, and the reason for this is, you know, if there's a new software update or a new driver
[8440.54 → 8445.20] that's in play, uh, we always, we always recollect our data for new projects.
[8446.00 → 8451.66] Um, unfortunately, the way that he presented it was not particularly tactful.
[8452.16 → 8462.50] Um, and I can see how while he was simply stating a fact, um, it could have been interpreted
[8462.50 → 8470.74] the wrong way, um, by Hardware Unboxed in particular, responded to this situation saying that they
[8470.74 → 8475.30] were, they seemed, I won't say that said they were, I read all the tweets, but they, they
[8475.30 → 8479.26] said they, they seem, they, I will say they seemed, uh, pretty upset.
[8479.26 → 8487.46] Um, however, they also acknowledged that they do not in fact, uh, run new data for every
[8487.46 → 8487.98] project.
[8488.26 → 8496.34] So strictly speaking, uh, what Tim said was not true, but we don't want to, we don't
[8496.34 → 8499.28] want to be talking about it the way that we did.
[8499.28 → 8505.58] I don't think we should ever make a comparison that is, you know, a good thing we do compared
[8505.58 → 8507.00] to those other guys.
[8507.00 → 8510.30] If anything, we should be trying to, to build each other up.
[8510.40 → 8510.50] Yeah.
[8510.58 → 8515.90] We, we respect, um, Gamers Nexus and Hardware Unboxed a lot, which were the two particular
[8515.90 → 8517.46] outlets that were referenced by Tim.
[8518.00 → 8523.76] Um, and, but with that said, you know, obviously it's not like we aren't aware of what they're
[8523.76 → 8524.06] doing.
[8524.06 → 8529.50] And, uh, obviously our goal internally is to try to take whatever bar has been set by
[8529.50 → 8533.18] our peers in the industry and try to do as good or better.
[8533.80 → 8534.28] Um.
[8534.28 → 8536.70] As it, as it kind of is for everybody.
[8536.86 → 8537.06] Yeah.
[8537.08 → 8542.54] So back to Tim's wording, um, I didn't hire him to be a PR representative, which is good
[8542.54 → 8545.82] because clearly that's not where his experience is.
[8545.88 → 8550.70] I hired him to work on mechanical engineering and other, actually other engineering tasks as
[8550.70 → 8555.84] well, which is good because rightly he's really proud of the work that, uh, he and the team
[8555.84 → 8559.04] have been doing both publicly facing and behind the scenes.
[8559.38 → 8564.98] Um, he also is right that retesting every time is better.
[8564.98 → 8568.18] And it's something that we're putting a lot of effort and a lot of resources into doing,
[8568.18 → 8574.18] but that doesn't mean that, you know, other publications don't have things that they're
[8574.18 → 8576.08] doing that are better than I.
[8576.08 → 8580.06] So, so that just shouldn't be the way that we frame it because obviously everyone is
[8580.06 → 8583.22] out there trying to do their best and trying to differentiate.
[8584.06 → 8590.66] Um, so yeah, Tim shouldn't have said what he did, and he definitely should have provided
[8590.66 → 8591.70] the entire context.
[8591.70 → 8597.32] Like for example, um, I know Steve from gamers Nexus at least used to, maybe I think still
[8597.32 → 8597.64] does.
[8597.72 → 8601.94] I haven't checked out anything recently, but he would label, uh, data that was using older
[8601.94 → 8604.60] driver revisions when he was reusing it.
[8605.28 → 8612.24] Um, and I know that, uh, Steve from hardware unboxed clarified that they, okay, I'm trying
[8612.24 → 8613.44] to remember the exact wording.
[8613.54 → 8616.36] It was in a tweet, and I'm not logged into x.com here right now.
[8616.36 → 8618.64] So you'll have to forgive me if I don't get this perfectly right.
[8618.64 → 8624.20] I think he said they, they mostly do except when they deem it's not necessary by testing
[8624.20 → 8624.46] it.
[8624.62 → 8628.60] But then I was a little bit confused by that wording because if they did test it, why wouldn't
[8628.60 → 8629.70] they just use the new data?
[8629.70 → 8632.72] So I'm not, I'm not a hundred percent sure what he meant by that.
[8632.76 → 8635.60] I'm sure he'll probably tweet or something clarifying it at some point.
[8635.70 → 8637.30] So, uh, you can just check him out.
[8637.34 → 8642.20] I think it's just at hardware unboxed if I'm not mistaken, or you could just Google, you
[8642.20 → 8643.16] know, I'll just Google it now.
[8643.68 → 8646.34] Uh, hardware unboxed Twitter.
[8647.70 → 8649.10] Yeah, it's just at hardware unboxed.
[8649.14 → 8651.10] So I'm sure he'll have something to say about this later on.
[8651.20 → 8656.58] Anyway, the point is that, uh, he shouldn't have said what he said, and he should have provided
[8656.58 → 8657.78] the entire perspective.
[8658.66 → 8663.14] Um, uh, let me just say blah, blah, blah.
[8663.36 → 8663.54] Yeah.
[8663.64 → 8663.96] Anyway.
[8663.96 → 8665.98] And I've spoken with him about it personally.
[8665.98 → 8670.96] And as far as I can tell, he was just excited about our work and proud of the team.
[8670.96 → 8673.44] Um, and it, it came out.
[8673.92 → 8679.52] Um, the bottom line is that our vision from our chief vision officer, that's me, is very
[8679.52 → 8680.12] clear here.
[8680.24 → 8686.94] We want to meet or raise the bar when it comes to consumer product testing, which I would
[8686.94 → 8689.94] hope we can all agree is a good thing.
[8690.08 → 8692.36] We've definitely gone through some growing pains.
[8692.36 → 8696.08] We have not shied away from talking about those.
[8696.22 → 8698.62] We are, we are happy to issue corrections.
[8698.98 → 8701.06] We will not sweep things under the rug.
[8701.94 → 8703.56] Um, but it's been a challenge.
[8703.56 → 8708.04] Like we're attempting to do this at a scale that as far as I can tell has not been done
[8708.04 → 8708.40] before.
[8708.40 → 8713.62] And the more cooks you have in the kitchen, the more room there is for miscommunications.
[8713.84 → 8718.58] And we have, we're a really in the grand scheme of things, we're a really young company
[8718.58 → 8720.22] and we have a lot to learn.
[8720.22 → 8723.72] And I mean that both in the sense of that the team here, like we don't have a lot of
[8723.72 → 8725.44] grizzled veterans from anything.
[8725.82 → 8731.58] And the company itself is, has only just passed its 10th candle day, right?
[8731.62 → 8735.64] Like it's, we, we have a lot to learn, and we don't shy away from that.
[8736.12 → 8741.18] Um, yeah, part of it actually is just like the kinds of projects that we have.
[8741.22 → 8742.82] We haven't shown everything that we're working on.
[8742.86 → 8744.14] Like it's super ambitious.
[8744.74 → 8748.80] Uh, and the reason for that is partly because we want to focus on what's in front of us and
[8748.80 → 8752.90] partly because some of it is so ambitious that we don't know for sure how long it'll
[8752.90 → 8755.54] take or if we will get there at all.
[8755.64 → 8757.68] But again, this is a good thing.
[8757.76 → 8761.94] We, we want to be ambitious and you guys want us to be ambitious.
[8762.28 → 8764.92] More sources for information means more perspectives.
[8765.20 → 8771.52] It also means that more consumers can be reached because not everybody is going to find LTT appealing
[8771.52 → 8776.00] and not everybody is going to find hardware unboxed appealing or gamers nexus or Jay's two cents
[8776.00 → 8781.06] or Paul's hardware or any of the number of other fantastic publications that are out there.
[8781.06 → 8781.28] Right.
[8781.42 → 8786.30] And so the more people are, you know, doing a great job, the better.
[8786.30 → 8791.16] Like I'm, I don't know, I'm, I'm getting a little bit confused by some of the sentiment
[8791.16 → 8798.84] that seems to be spreading in the community, especially, I don't know, over the last six months,
[8798.84 → 8803.42] six to 12 months, it's hard to, it's hard to pinpoint it, but it kind of feels like there's
[8803.42 → 8810.08] like a there's like an US versus them attitude that's brewing right now where it's like content
[8810.08 → 8811.58] creator versus content creator.
[8811.58 → 8813.08] Like I'm team LTT.
[8813.08 → 8814.50] Like, I don't want that.
[8814.56 → 8816.00] I'm not asking you for that.
[8816.00 → 8820.94] Or like I'm team Jay's two cents, or I'm team gamers nexus or hardware unboxed or whatever.
[8821.22 → 8828.38] Like it's, uh, I'm just, I'm kind of at a loss for added deal with that to be perfectly
[8828.38 → 8830.56] honest with you because I don't think it's good.
[8831.08 → 8833.58] Well, yeah, I mean, I've worked for years.
[8833.58 → 8837.96] I have worked to foster an environment where that is not the attitude.
[8837.96 → 8848.52] Like let's look no further than last week, last week, not even a full week ago, we spent
[8848.52 → 8855.54] over 150,000 us dollars to fly tech creators from around the world to network with each other
[8855.54 → 8857.30] and to engage with the community.
[8857.82 → 8864.92] Like obviously for us, they are part of the attraction of the show, but at that cost, that
[8864.92 → 8868.04] is not even close to a break-even proposition for us.
[8868.04 → 8868.88] Not even close.
[8869.16 → 8872.00] We don't even ask them to do anything.
[8872.86 → 8874.08] Nothing is required.
[8874.62 → 8878.28] Meet and greets, completely voluntary panels, completely voluntary.
[8878.64 → 8881.22] We don't even require them to be at the expo.
[8881.22 → 8886.12] We fly them in, we give them a pass, no strings attached, obviously.
[8886.86 → 8891.94] Like if they don't participate at all, we're probably not going to invite them again, but
[8891.94 → 8893.54] that's, that's it.
[8894.02 → 8894.12] Yeah.
[8895.28 → 8899.34] And it's like, that's just one of the ways that we do try.
[8899.42 → 8901.70] And we brought out tiny creators this time.
[8901.76 → 8907.10] We tried to just go for total scattershot variety pack to have there.
[8907.10 → 8911.84] And we got a lot of really great feedback from them about the networking they were able to
[8911.84 → 8913.02] do and from the community.
[8913.26 → 8917.76] And that's just one of the ways that we try to bring others up and build collaboration and
[8917.76 → 8920.78] community in the tech space, particularly among our fellow YouTubers.
[8921.04 → 8924.86] Like I've gone to our community's defence over and over.
[8926.74 → 8931.94] Like whenever it's over, anything that opposes our common goal, I think is the best way of
[8931.94 → 8932.64] sort of stating it.
[8932.64 → 8936.70] Whether that's consumer rights, like contributing to Lewis Grossman's right to repair campaign
[8936.70 → 8941.72] or going to bat for hardware inbox when they were pressured by NVIDIA, which by the way,
[8941.80 → 8945.36] cost me literal years of relationship with team green.
[8945.72 → 8949.04] And which by the way, I would do again, gladly in the same situation.
[8949.04 → 8955.88] Like the number of people that call us NVIDIA shills these days when for many months after
[8955.88 → 8960.28] that NVIDIA wouldn't so much as exchange a word with me, like literally nobody.
[8960.28 → 8960.48] Nobody.
[8961.18 → 8962.52] Um, I don't know.
[8962.84 → 8965.00] My battle lines are clearly drawn.
[8965.62 → 8967.26] We are on the side of the consumer.
[8967.56 → 8972.86] We are working together to hold manufacturers accountable and friendly competition between
[8972.86 → 8973.60] media outlets.
[8973.72 → 8975.24] That is good.
[8975.82 → 8978.78] That is what everybody wants.
[8980.06 → 8981.12] Competition is good.
[8981.18 → 8985.12] We don't get to say competition is good for manufacturers.
[8985.12 → 8986.60] And not us.
[8986.72 → 8992.40] We have also quite literally always, since the dawn of at least us working together, said
[8992.40 → 8995.02] that you should seek out multiple sources of information.
[8995.62 → 8996.04] Exactly.
[8996.18 → 9002.10] You want people doing this type of stuff, a multitude of them, so that you can see all of
[9002.10 → 9005.66] it together and kind of mix it all up and see what the good conclusion is.
[9005.66 → 9010.36] And anyone who thinks competition is good for someone else, but not good for themselves,
[9010.78 → 9012.32] doesn't really believe it.
[9012.32 → 9014.04] I believe it.
[9014.76 → 9015.86] I love it.
[9016.14 → 9020.80] I like probably love competition too much, but it's a lot sometimes.
[9021.72 → 9025.72] But I mean, what, how else do we all move forward, Luke?
[9026.00 → 9026.20] Yeah.
[9026.26 → 9026.40] Yeah.
[9026.68 → 9030.42] Um, so yeah, we're, we're not going to stop pushing hard.
[9030.42 → 9035.06] If, if hardware in box retests mostly, why shouldn't we try to do it every time?
[9035.06 → 9042.82] If they run at 22 degrees Celsius, why shouldn't we try to do at 22 and at 40, both in and outside
[9042.82 → 9043.42] of a case?
[9043.66 → 9048.00] If they do 20 games at three resolutions, why shouldn't we try to do 30 games at five
[9048.00 → 9048.48] resolutions?
[9049.00 → 9050.20] That's healthy.
[9050.34 → 9052.60] And then when we do that, why shouldn't they try to do more?
[9053.00 → 9054.08] That's to your benefit.
[9055.44 → 9056.74] We're not playing dirty.
[9057.20 → 9061.38] We've literally never done anything to disadvantage another creator.
[9061.38 → 9064.06] I will not say a bad word.
[9064.18 → 9067.10] I will not try to prevent anyone from moving up.
[9067.48 → 9071.66] I personally stepped in to ensure that the Fox, for example, got a Steam Deck at launch
[9071.66 → 9072.66] and he did.
[9072.82 → 9075.88] There were two outlets on the list, us and Gamers Nexus.
[9076.08 → 9077.96] It could have been basically a semi-exclusive.
[9078.38 → 9084.54] And I was like, yo, if you guys are doing anything else, you have got to get this guy in the roster.
[9084.54 → 9085.90] And they did.
[9086.88 → 9092.06] I don't talk about this kind of thing because I don't feel like I should talk about it.
[9092.10 → 9093.08] I should just do it.
[9093.26 → 9095.44] And my peers in the industry know it.
[9095.64 → 9097.04] They know I do these things.
[9097.10 → 9100.32] So if they don't, if they can't see it, then that's kind of on them at this point.
[9101.74 → 9106.28] You know if my team doesn't know that this is our approach, they need to get trained.
[9106.40 → 9108.70] That's on me or that's on our new CEO.
[9109.34 → 9112.64] But at the end of the day, like, we're just going to keep doing what we're doing,
[9112.72 → 9113.82] which is we're going to go hard.
[9114.20 → 9115.30] We're going to make some mistakes.
[9115.72 → 9118.70] I'll be sorry for them, just like I'm sorry for what happened here.
[9118.80 → 9123.18] But at the end of the day, we're all aligned on working hard to create more tools that help
[9123.18 → 9125.46] people get into this space that we're all so passionate about.
[9125.72 → 9127.30] Help them get the best for their money, right?
[9127.30 → 9134.32] Like, all I ask is for everyone to try to remember as we move forward that we are all
[9134.32 → 9135.58] on the same team.
[9135.58 → 9140.06] We are all on the side of the consumer, and that's for both the folks outside our organization
[9140.06 → 9141.60] and inside it.
[9142.04 → 9142.14] Yeah.
[9143.62 → 9148.68] There's another thing that's like in the future of this company, it's very possible that
[9148.68 → 9149.98] something like this might happen again.
[9151.50 → 9156.00] And an example that someone at Flow plane chat brought up that I have brought up many
[9156.00 → 9157.54] times is the Blizzard devs.
[9158.04 → 9158.12] Yeah.
[9158.20 → 9162.26] I trash on Blizzard as a company all the time, but something that I respect that they do at
[9162.26 → 9163.94] Blazon is they put devs up on stage.
[9163.94 → 9165.28] It's not just PR people.
[9165.60 → 9165.68] Yeah.
[9165.68 → 9173.68] And that has repeatedly over time been a bad thing for Blizzard because the devs will say
[9173.68 → 9177.40] something that doesn't jive super well with the community and the community will smash
[9177.40 → 9177.94] them for it.
[9178.18 → 9184.70] And I think it's important to remember that we want those types of interactions.
[9185.04 → 9189.30] I want to hear from the devs at Blizzard, not just the PR people.
[9189.30 → 9194.56] And I want people like Tim on our team to be able to speak directly to the audience and
[9194.56 → 9197.96] to be passionate and to be driven and to care a lot about their work.
[9198.76 → 9202.62] And every once in a while, it's not going to go perfectly.
[9203.22 → 9205.04] And that's okay.
[9205.12 → 9205.86] We'll try to fix it.
[9205.96 → 9206.46] But yeah.
[9206.46 → 9211.34] I feel like some of you are not taking quite the right things away from what I said.
[9211.38 → 9215.82] By the way, there's a fair number of people that are talking about the whole trust me bro
[9215.82 → 9221.46] situation where there were some creators that...
[9221.46 → 9226.06] It seems like you guys are...
[9226.06 → 9228.42] Look.
[9232.56 → 9238.48] It's pretty clear that not everyone in the creator space handled that super professionally.
[9239.12 → 9243.30] I don't obviously agree with some of the takes that were out there.
[9243.30 → 9252.72] I don't think that it's particularly journalistic, for example, to ignore facts, to ignore personal
[9252.72 → 9258.54] relationships that you have every opportunity to take advantage of, to get more information.
[9259.12 → 9261.12] I don't actually agree with that.
[9261.18 → 9267.70] I think that's objectively not correct, especially where there's a large conflict of interest.
[9268.16 → 9271.80] However, the point is not to dwell on that.
[9271.80 → 9273.74] Like, good lord, that was like...
[9273.74 → 9274.72] How long ago was that?
[9274.74 → 9275.96] It feels like it was quite a while ago.
[9275.98 → 9276.06] Who cares?
[9276.58 → 9277.04] A year?
[9277.44 → 9278.66] We've made mistakes too.
[9278.72 → 9280.44] We've made lots of mistakes.
[9281.14 → 9282.32] Everybody makes mistakes.
[9283.54 → 9284.94] I never even...
[9284.94 → 9287.08] I never even drew attention to any of that.
[9287.94 → 9288.34] Intentionally.
[9288.76 → 9290.02] Because it doesn't matter.
[9290.16 → 9291.46] I don't want to stir up drama.
[9292.22 → 9293.98] Whoa, I was like surprisingly accurate.
[9294.20 → 9295.34] It's almost exactly a year.
[9295.68 → 9295.94] Yeah.
[9296.22 → 9297.34] A year ago!
[9298.12 → 9298.94] It's fine.
[9300.76 → 9301.44] It's over.
[9302.22 → 9303.02] Let's all just...
[9303.02 → 9304.62] Let's all just move forward.
[9304.70 → 9305.24] It doesn't matter.
[9306.48 → 9306.90] Yeah.
[9307.02 → 9307.38] All right.
[9308.80 → 9312.52] Now, it's time for us to move forward to the next section.
[9312.64 → 9315.88] Yeah, let's talk about Microsoft embracing repairable Xbox controllers.
[9316.52 → 9317.16] Oh, cool.
[9317.22 → 9319.50] Yeah, they sell replacement parts for Xbox controllers.
[9319.74 → 9324.06] They have posted step-by-step repair guides, and the parts include PCBA's.
[9324.46 → 9325.94] That must just be PCBs.
[9326.00 → 9326.36] That's got to be...
[9326.36 → 9327.22] What's a PCBA?
[9327.54 → 9328.26] PCB Assembly.
[9328.26 → 9329.06] Oh, that must be it.
[9329.60 → 9333.32] Buttons, top cases, and motor assemblies with attached rumble motors.
[9333.84 → 9334.82] This is...
[9334.82 → 9336.10] I mean, on the surface...
[9336.10 → 9336.12] Just awesome.
[9336.46 → 9340.92] At least Microsoft following through with a promise to explore helping customers repair
[9340.92 → 9342.06] their own hardware from 2021.
[9342.30 → 9346.30] When they promised to explore it, I basically went, ugh.
[9347.00 → 9349.14] We're never going to see anything from this because, I mean...
[9349.14 → 9350.04] It's just explored.
[9350.04 → 9355.48] In our defence, we had just come off opening up some Surface laptop or something or tablet.
[9355.56 → 9356.82] I forget exactly what it was.
[9357.14 → 9357.76] But it was like...
[9357.76 → 9358.30] Very poor repairability.
[9358.60 → 9360.84] It was like 1 out of 10 repairability score from fixity.
[9360.88 → 9362.98] We could barely figure out how to get the stupid thing open.
[9366.36 → 9367.32] And here it is.
[9367.42 → 9368.48] Okay, they actually did something.
[9368.66 → 9373.74] I mean, there are still a lot of things that they could do in their designs to make them
[9373.74 → 9375.48] more repairable by their nature.
[9376.18 → 9378.58] But this is something.
[9378.70 → 9379.44] Oh, that's great.
[9379.52 → 9380.96] Our next talking point says,
[9381.34 → 9385.00] Many Microsoft products are still compromised by past design decisions.
[9385.08 → 9385.64] Yeah, exactly.
[9386.06 → 9391.00] Two months ago, for example, hardware technician The Coder criticized Microsoft for the design
[9391.00 → 9394.74] of the SSDs in their Xbox Series consoles, which are encrypted in a way that makes them
[9394.74 → 9396.50] impossible to replace independently.
[9396.98 → 9401.14] It's like, we harp on Apple for this stuff, so we're certainly not going to let it slide when
[9401.14 → 9401.90] Microsoft does it.
[9402.04 → 9403.08] That sucks.
[9403.08 → 9405.48] And it doesn't need to be done.
[9406.04 → 9411.64] With the kind of R&D budget, man, the Apple SSD thing was even, like, actually deeper than
[9411.64 → 9412.00] I thought.
[9412.10 → 9419.06] I linked a really great forum post under the starting at is the biggest lie in tech.
[9419.28 → 9423.54] There's a really great post on the forum that goes into how very different Apple's SSD
[9423.54 → 9424.44] architecture is.
[9424.44 → 9428.98] Pretty much all of it is completely unnecessary.
[9429.90 → 9437.22] Like, literally, completely unnecessary, but overcomplicates it and makes it proprietary
[9437.22 → 9445.16] because why use a wheel that exists when you can reinvent the crap out of your own and make
[9445.16 → 9449.14] it the whee lest wheel that is different from the other wheels?
[9449.14 → 9451.10] This one's got spokes.
[9451.10 → 9457.46] If the amount of resources that companies like Apple and Microsoft dedicate to making
[9457.46 → 9463.70] their devices less repairable instead went to making them more repairable, how much better
[9463.70 → 9465.24] of a place would the world be?
[9465.96 → 9468.38] Plugin PlayStation says, wasn't this just in a game-linked video?
[9468.88 → 9469.36] Yes.
[9469.68 → 9474.70] The WAN show is late news from white guys with beards.
[9474.70 → 9478.22] It's not even really news.
[9478.66 → 9479.72] I mean, it's right in the name.
[9479.80 → 9480.02] New.
[9480.20 → 9480.78] It's not new.
[9481.06 → 9481.34] Yeah.
[9481.60 → 9483.70] The WAN show's always been like that.
[9485.76 → 9486.20] Yeah.
[9486.32 → 9491.52] I mean, they're probably right to trash on them for certain things, but they did a cool thing.
[9492.02 → 9492.44] Thank you.
[9492.64 → 9492.96] It's good.
[9493.90 → 9494.60] This is cool.
[9497.44 → 9498.02] All right.
[9498.34 → 9501.42] Microsoft also got called out for their negligent cybersecurity practices.
[9501.56 → 9502.82] I mean, is this that interesting?
[9502.82 → 9504.76] Oh, this is kind of an update.
[9504.78 → 9506.62] This is a readdress of a previous topic.
[9506.96 → 9507.06] Yeah.
[9507.26 → 9507.56] Ooh.
[9507.72 → 9511.04] China proposes extreme limits for children's internet access, though.
[9511.48 → 9515.82] We've talked a fair bit about this recently, but the Cyberspace Administration of China,
[9515.96 → 9523.58] appropriately named CAC, has proposed new regulations harshly limiting internet use among minors.
[9523.58 → 9530.66] 16 to 18-year-olds, so barely even children, would be allowed two hours of internet access per day,
[9531.46 → 9536.04] one hour for eight to 16-year-olds, and 40 minutes for kids under eight.
[9536.58 → 9539.56] Access for minors will also be banned between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
[9539.56 → 9543.08] Man, I wasn't going to bed at 10 p.m. when I was 17.
[9543.78 → 9544.90] Are you kidding me?
[9545.30 → 9550.48] In an official statement, the CAC said that the regulations are to help minors reduce internet
[9550.48 → 9553.98] addiction and the influence of bad information.
[9555.94 → 9557.06] Oh, man.
[9557.06 → 9559.78] So, yeah.
[9559.98 → 9564.20] The stocks of several tech firms, including Tencent and ByteDance, fell sharply following the announcement,
[9564.70 → 9566.54] and that's pretty uncool.
[9567.58 → 9567.94] Ooh!
[9568.20 → 9568.48] Ooh!
[9569.22 → 9570.44] This is a really great video.
[9574.04 → 9577.28] Definitive Mac Upgrade Guide is the name of this channel,
[9577.68 → 9582.28] and he posted an absolutely amazing review.
[9582.48 → 9583.12] That's not it.
[9583.56 → 9584.02] Gosh darn it.
[9584.10 → 9584.56] There it is.
[9584.56 → 9584.86] Hey!
[9584.86 → 9587.44] Amazing review of the LTT backpack.
[9588.44 → 9593.86] He doesn't say that everything is positive, which he shouldn't, because it's a review.
[9594.54 → 9600.82] I want nothing more than actual honest impressions of it, but he seems to be really happy with his,
[9600.98 → 9604.12] and oh, Dan, can you nuke us in the corner here for a sec?
[9605.82 → 9607.06] Just very briefly.
[9607.66 → 9613.54] And what I really love about this is he's actually been using the darn thing for nine months.
[9613.54 → 9619.02] So he includes a lot of perfect insights into what it's like to use the bag.
[9619.22 → 9620.80] Anyway, that was all I have to say about that.
[9620.88 → 9622.44] That's all the content that I'll be showing.
[9623.44 → 9624.56] Was that React content?
[9625.06 → 9626.96] No, I don't think so, because we didn't even have the audio playing.
[9627.02 → 9628.76] Oh, shoot, Dan, was I talking over audio?
[9629.16 → 9629.40] No.
[9629.62 → 9629.98] Oh, good.
[9630.04 → 9630.70] The video is funny.
[9630.74 → 9630.96] Thanks, Dan.
[9631.06 → 9631.42] Good job.
[9631.42 → 9638.18] And I'm saying, I think you'll be really interested in what he has to say, which I haven't shown you.
[9638.58 → 9643.36] So if anything, I think we are having a positive impact on the market for this content.
[9645.56 → 9646.64] Should we do more?
[9647.66 → 9648.06] Oh.
[9649.02 → 9649.46] Okay.
[9649.64 → 9650.30] Yeah, should we do that?
[9650.30 → 9651.96] Yeah, we should probably do this.
[9652.90 → 9654.76] We got called out a little bit.
[9654.92 → 9656.48] Yeah, it's time for some...
[9656.48 → 9657.76] Oh, this is so stupid.
[9658.58 → 9660.88] Like, what a piece of crap site this is now.
[9662.06 → 9664.30] I'm not signed in, so that's probably why.
[9664.68 → 9664.90] Yeah.
[9665.00 → 9666.60] But like, really?
[9668.26 → 9669.34] Is that...
[9669.34 → 9672.02] Is anyone signed in to x.com?
[9672.08 → 9672.82] Wait, what?
[9673.28 → 9675.18] It didn't redirect to x.com.
[9675.18 → 9678.22] Hmm.
[9679.06 → 9680.30] What the crap?
[9680.96 → 9683.22] What if I just do this?
[9683.36 → 9684.04] Will it work?
[9688.72 → 9689.20] What?
[9690.52 → 9692.12] X is redirecting to Twitter?
[9693.12 → 9693.86] They're going back.
[9694.42 → 9695.18] Did the...
[9695.18 → 9695.44] What?
[9695.62 → 9696.26] Is this...
[9696.26 → 9697.20] Am I...
[9697.20 → 9698.14] Am I...
[9698.14 → 9702.66] Wait, did x.com ever actually...
[9702.66 → 9703.02] I don't know.
[9703.32 → 9704.72] I know the app name changed.
[9704.80 → 9705.06] Yeah.
[9705.54 → 9708.14] But wait, isn't the app name not changing on iOS?
[9708.14 → 9708.74] Apparently no.
[9708.84 → 9711.30] x.com redirects to Twitter are never the other way around.
[9711.36 → 9711.90] Oh, okay.
[9712.38 → 9715.10] Did you hear that Apple's apparently not letting them just...
[9715.10 → 9717.02] They don't allow one...
[9717.02 → 9718.18] One...
[9718.18 → 9720.42] One character app names?
[9721.30 → 9722.00] So they're just...
[9722.00 → 9723.40] It's still called Twitter on iOS?
[9724.26 → 9725.00] It's great.
[9725.60 → 9726.60] That's pretty sick.
[9726.86 → 9728.50] Oh, Apple apparently made an exception.
[9728.92 → 9729.10] Okay.
[9729.64 → 9729.86] All right.
[9729.90 → 9730.74] I thought they did.
[9731.04 → 9731.22] Okay.
[9731.22 → 9733.26] But I wasn't sure if that was Google Play or what.
[9733.26 → 9734.80] Well, at any rate...
[9734.80 → 9738.38] Well, I kind of wanted to react to Ludwig's thing.
[9738.56 → 9738.86] Oh, wait.
[9738.90 → 9739.60] No, this is on YouTube.
[9739.76 → 9739.98] Okay.
[9740.46 → 9741.22] Ludwig responds.
[9741.30 → 9741.98] Let's get some audio.
[9743.16 → 9744.12] Are we going to be able to hear it?
[9744.16 → 9745.02] It's a really cool setup.
[9745.32 → 9745.92] If rag on...
[9745.92 → 9746.26] Can we?
[9746.90 → 9747.96] I can hear you, little bitch.
[9748.34 → 9748.94] Don't ever think...
[9748.94 → 9749.34] Okay.
[9749.34 → 9749.46] Okay.
[9751.30 → 9752.32] See me in Counter-Strike.
[9752.48 → 9753.50] Nice computer setup.
[9753.70 → 9753.90] Pussy.
[9753.90 → 9754.66] Dude, I would...
[9754.66 → 9756.32] I would torch Linus.
[9756.50 → 9758.18] I think any game.
[9758.30 → 9759.58] I don't think there is a...
[9759.58 → 9760.46] There is a...
[9760.46 → 9762.54] There is a game Linus gaps me in.
[9762.66 → 9764.66] Maybe I'm underestimating his boomer energy
[9764.66 → 9768.58] and he gig gaps me in like Civ 6 or some shit, but...
[9768.58 → 9768.86] Oh.
[9772.48 → 9772.96] Okay.
[9774.78 → 9775.22] Hmm.
[9776.48 → 9779.00] He reacted to us reacting to his setup.
[9779.78 → 9782.46] And you know, he made some somewhat fair comments.
[9782.48 → 9783.68] He made some somewhat fair points.
[9783.80 → 9787.32] We teased him for his giant key, which he apparently got for doing charity work.
[9787.32 → 9789.38] Which is like awesome and sorry.
[9789.38 → 9789.96] Which is pretty cool.
[9789.96 → 9791.58] But did he just call...
[9791.58 → 9794.34] Did he just describe me as having boomer energy?
[9794.70 → 9794.84] Yeah.
[9794.96 → 9796.06] You usually say dragon.
[9796.16 → 9797.30] How does it feel hearing boomer?
[9797.50 → 9797.80] Yeah.
[9797.92 → 9798.82] I'm not sure...
[9798.82 → 9801.44] I'm not sure how I feel about that.
[9802.12 → 9803.84] I'm going to have to have a little nap.
[9806.62 → 9807.50] Eat some...
[9807.50 → 9808.48] Eat some bran flakes.
[9808.50 → 9809.12] Eat some fibre.
[9811.50 → 9815.74] Have a little think about it while I'm on the can working on things for a while.
[9815.92 → 9816.16] Yeah.
[9816.38 → 9816.56] Yeah.
[9816.56 → 9816.76] Yeah.
[9816.76 → 9817.06] Yeah.
[9817.48 → 9817.96] Yeah.
[9817.96 → 9822.90] Maybe come to conclusions when you wake up in the middle of the night and go to the washroom.
[9823.08 → 9823.32] Yeah.
[9823.50 → 9824.78] I, um...
[9824.78 → 9828.54] All right, Ludwig.
[9829.26 → 9830.48] Challenge accepted, sir.
[9830.62 → 9831.78] I get to name the game.
[9832.72 → 9836.28] You guys feel free to let him know I accept his challenge.
[9836.42 → 9837.56] In fact...
[9837.56 → 9838.56] In fact...
[9839.56 → 9841.56] I will...
[9842.88 → 9845.40] I would like to make it five games.
[9845.40 → 9852.46] I will only take a small advantage since you said you could beat me at any game and I will choose only three of them.
[9853.12 → 9853.74] How about that?
[9854.06 → 9855.54] He gets to pick two of the games.
[9855.76 → 9855.92] Oh.
[9856.68 → 9858.06] I mean, I want to make it interesting.
[9858.42 → 9861.52] Yeah, but he's just going to pick things that he has like tons of experience in and just smash.
[9861.60 → 9862.24] So am I.
[9863.52 → 9863.70] Oh.
[9863.70 → 9869.40] That's an alarm to do something when I definitely will have to be for sure at home.
[9871.42 → 9872.36] Ah-ha-ha-ha.
[9872.46 → 9873.14] What time is it?
[9873.44 → 9874.12] Don't look.
[9874.40 → 9874.68] Nice.
[9875.08 → 9875.44] Sick.
[9876.02 → 9876.70] Okay, so...
[9876.70 → 9877.02] Do you know what?
[9877.08 → 9878.08] Are you going to pick the games now?
[9879.06 → 9881.22] Ooh, that's risky because it gives him time to train up.
[9881.32 → 9882.06] It's a little risky.
[9882.06 → 9888.04] I'm obviously going to take Beat Safer because it'll be funny watching him get absolutely f***ING annihilated.
[9888.28 → 9888.48] Uh-huh.
[9890.12 → 9891.20] I don't know if he plays...
[9891.20 → 9891.82] I mean, I don't know.
[9891.98 → 9892.82] Maybe he plays a bunch.
[9893.08 → 9894.50] Am I good at anything else?
[9895.36 → 9896.32] See, this is tough.
[9896.98 → 9897.80] I mean, I could just...
[9897.80 → 9899.84] Yeah, I mean, I could go full Boomer Energy.
[9899.96 → 9905.96] I'm not good at Civ, but you play Anna 1800 with me and I will wipe the floor with you.
[9906.04 → 9907.14] Can you play it competitively?
[9907.50 → 9908.02] Yeah, you can.
[9908.08 → 9908.78] Yeah, you can play versus.
[9908.78 → 9909.18] You totally can.
[9909.42 → 9909.78] 100%.
[9909.78 → 9910.94] That'll be a long game.
[9910.94 → 9914.14] He could train for like two months and I would still destroy him.
[9914.16 → 9915.52] That is actually probably true.
[9916.36 → 9920.00] What about like Mario...
[9920.00 → 9920.50] What is that?
[9920.58 → 9922.54] Mario Kart Battles with the balloons?
[9922.90 → 9924.82] Oh, like Mario Kart 64 Battle Mode?
[9924.96 → 9926.54] Yeah, I would wreck him.
[9927.72 → 9928.94] But, but...
[9929.78 → 9931.80] Actually, there's a lot of minor VGA.
[9932.58 → 9935.38] I would win at that, but that's a stupid game.
[9935.44 → 9936.22] We're not going to play that.
[9937.46 → 9938.22] We've got...
[9938.22 → 9939.34] Oh, Supreme Commander.
[9939.34 → 9941.28] Okay, but I'm not going to pick two RTSs.
[9941.34 → 9942.08] Yeah, Supreme Commander.
[9942.18 → 9944.10] He wouldn't even manage to get any units built.
[9944.82 → 9945.02] Like...
[9945.02 → 9947.74] Maybe if he practiced, he'd get some units built.
[9949.30 → 9951.06] You can build units very quickly.
[9951.06 → 9951.44] You know what?
[9951.94 → 9953.76] Subcom is a shorter round than Anna 1800.
[9954.06 → 9955.24] I'm taking Subcom.
[9955.50 → 9955.74] Okay.
[9955.96 → 9958.74] But it has to be FAF Subcom.
[9958.88 → 9959.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9959.60 → 9959.94] Yeah, yeah.
[9959.94 → 9960.82] Yeah, Fortune Alliance Forever.
[9960.82 → 9962.68] Okay, so my games.
[9963.36 → 9963.92] Beat Safer.
[9964.66 → 9965.74] Fortune Alliance Forever.
[9966.90 → 9971.24] And some people are suggesting Left 4 Dead 2.
[9971.80 → 9974.18] Do we each put together a squad?
[9974.38 → 9975.90] And do we make one a team game?
[9976.26 → 9977.42] Because I'm super down.
[9978.08 → 9978.54] I've got...
[9978.54 → 9981.58] I think I could put together a pretty crack Left 4 Dead 2 squad.
[9981.58 → 9984.28] I don't know that you'd be on it.
[9984.28 → 9984.52] I know.
[9984.64 → 9986.48] I'm sitting here thinking, like, I need to practice.
[9986.92 → 9987.06] Yeah.
[9987.06 → 9988.42] I know at least two...
[9988.42 → 9991.30] One person for sure is in.
[9991.52 → 9995.28] I could put together a pretty good Left 4 Dead 2 squad.
[9996.38 → 9997.88] Chase, like, immediately in chat.
[9997.96 → 9998.32] I'm in.
[9998.38 → 9999.12] I don't even know he's watching.
[9999.12 → 10000.18] I know you're in, Chase.
[10000.30 → 10000.88] Don't worry.
[10002.48 → 10004.44] That's why I brought out my phone.
[10004.84 → 10006.08] That alarm was fake.
[10006.58 → 10008.26] I was, like, texting Chase.
[10008.34 → 10009.24] I'm like, yo, dog.
[10009.72 → 10010.12] Yo.
[10010.26 → 10010.92] I need a ringer.
[10010.92 → 10012.08] Let's go.
[10013.36 → 10014.86] Yeah, but you've got to be careful here.
[10015.50 → 10021.04] Because if you set up him to be able to form a team, he might just get, like, pro players.
[10021.04 → 10022.44] Dude, I'm going to bring in Chase.
[10022.54 → 10023.68] I'm going to bring in Joe.
[10024.42 → 10024.68] Okay.
[10024.76 → 10025.78] Like, whatever.
[10026.16 → 10026.72] I don't know.
[10028.18 → 10029.30] I think he's pretty good.
[10031.12 → 10032.02] Okay, whatever.
[10032.30 → 10033.30] We'll have me and Chase.
[10033.38 → 10034.40] We'll figure out the other two.
[10034.52 → 10034.70] Okay.
[10034.90 → 10037.32] I also don't think he's even going to take this seriously at all.
[10037.32 → 10040.04] He's probably going to have, like, his mother on his team, so...
[10040.04 → 10040.80] I don't know, man.
[10041.38 → 10041.96] I don't know.
[10042.04 → 10046.10] I think you're underestimating the competitive nature of successful YouTubers.
[10046.68 → 10047.90] Ah, yeah, that's fair.
[10049.92 → 10050.28] Hmm.
[10050.98 → 10051.34] Okay.
[10051.50 → 10052.82] Well, I haven't finalized my third game yet.
[10052.82 → 10056.12] Does it have to be people from your respective teams?
[10056.56 → 10057.52] Is that one way to do it?
[10057.52 → 10057.98] Ooh.
[10057.98 → 10058.30] Ooh.
[10059.30 → 10062.14] So, Mogul versus Linus Media Group.
[10062.24 → 10062.34] Yeah.
[10062.34 → 10062.74] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10063.38 → 10065.74] That would actually make it more interesting, because then Joe's out.
[10065.74 → 10066.64] He has an East...
[10066.64 → 10067.18] No, he isn't.
[10067.68 → 10068.44] Oh, it's that Joe?
[10069.20 → 10070.18] Is that what you're thinking of?
[10070.30 → 10071.42] I actually didn't know that.
[10071.56 → 10073.16] Joe we game with is that Joe?
[10073.70 → 10075.12] You didn't know that?
[10075.12 → 10077.50] No, I thought Joe was just a friend of yours.
[10078.50 → 10079.76] That is hilarious.
[10080.98 → 10081.34] Have I ever...
[10081.34 → 10081.62] Really?
[10081.78 → 10083.38] Yeah, all this time.
[10083.96 → 10084.28] Whoa.
[10084.62 → 10086.64] I thought Joe was just, like, your buddy Joe.
[10086.96 → 10089.80] And you also had someone who works on your team named Joe.
[10089.80 → 10099.24] So, you've met him a bunch of times in real life...
[10099.24 → 10100.88] Never put the two together.
[10100.88 → 10101.60] ...and didn't put them together.
[10102.40 → 10102.92] Wow.
[10103.64 → 10107.12] Wow, that is the worst thing that has ever happened to me.
[10107.50 → 10108.70] That's very funny.
[10109.48 → 10111.56] That's actually, like, actually very funny.
[10111.56 → 10114.78] We have gamed together for, like, tens of hours.
[10115.10 → 10118.46] Like, not an insignificant amount of time.
[10118.48 → 10119.04] Over the course of years.
[10119.04 → 10120.04] And when you consider...
[10120.04 → 10121.86] Like, multiple...
[10121.86 → 10122.62] Not two years.
[10123.08 → 10124.84] Like, years, years.
[10126.36 → 10129.30] When you consider how much I game overall...
[10129.30 → 10129.98] It's a very high percentage.
[10129.98 → 10133.02] Like, he's one of my main gaming buddies at this point.
[10133.12 → 10133.36] Yeah.
[10133.50 → 10135.32] And I had no idea he worked for me.
[10140.32 → 10141.76] Our CEO, everybody.
[10142.04 → 10142.98] Oh, man.
[10143.90 → 10144.42] Wow.
[10144.78 → 10145.86] That's actually very funny.
[10146.86 → 10148.22] Don't show Joe this.
[10148.32 → 10148.82] Okay, well...
[10148.82 → 10149.68] He's going to see it.
[10149.68 → 10150.46] He's probably going to see it.
[10150.66 → 10150.96] But...
[10150.96 → 10151.54] Um...
[10151.54 → 10151.84] Okay.
[10152.50 → 10153.42] So...
[10153.42 → 10154.66] The mogul team has an esports team.
[10154.66 → 10157.66] So the one friend I thought I had is a paid friend again.
[10157.82 → 10158.28] Grrr.
[10158.28 → 10158.36] Grrr.
[10158.36 → 10162.62] Mogul esports.
[10162.62 → 10163.46] What do they play?
[10164.10 → 10165.22] Mogul games group?
[10165.42 → 10166.36] I don't think that's it.
[10167.56 → 10167.90] Oh, man.
[10167.90 → 10168.42] Uh...
[10168.42 → 10170.42] Oh...
[10170.42 → 10173.56] All right.
[10174.72 → 10174.86] Cool.
[10175.04 → 10175.20] Valorant?
[10175.26 → 10175.80] They play Valorant.
[10175.84 → 10176.66] They play a shooter game.
[10177.92 → 10180.44] He has an esports team that plays a shooter game.
[10180.44 → 10180.98] Hmm.
[10182.90 → 10183.22] Okay.
[10183.24 → 10184.08] That might be risky.
[10184.18 → 10185.26] What games did I pick already?
[10185.38 → 10187.34] I picked Supreme Commander Forged Alliance.
[10187.34 → 10188.32] Subcom is a good one.
[10188.42 → 10189.16] And I picked Beat Safer.
[10189.16 → 10189.74] Beat Safer is a good one.
[10190.14 → 10190.42] Okay.
[10190.86 → 10191.22] Okay.
[10191.22 → 10191.32] Okay.
[10194.76 → 10195.60] Moist Moguls.
[10195.78 → 10196.42] Oh, right.
[10196.52 → 10197.82] Because it's a collaboration thing.
[10198.52 → 10199.06] Oh, okay.
[10199.14 → 10199.90] Oh, that's super cool.
[10200.08 → 10200.48] I don't...
[10200.48 → 10201.06] I don't follow such a...
[10201.06 → 10201.34] All right.
[10201.36 → 10201.84] You know what?
[10202.74 → 10204.90] I think we do have to decide on a third.
[10205.18 → 10206.94] I think that if I just kind of go,
[10207.04 → 10208.16] Oh, well, I'll decide later.
[10208.20 → 10209.28] That's going to be kind of...
[10209.28 → 10210.44] That's going to be kind of cheesy.
[10211.98 → 10212.26] Okay.
[10212.32 → 10213.00] Do I have...
[10213.00 → 10213.20] Okay.
[10213.34 → 10215.26] Can you think of anything else I'm good at?
[10215.62 → 10217.62] I don't want to pick something from the same genre.
[10217.78 → 10220.08] Because I'm pretty sure that he doesn't have the attention span
[10220.08 → 10221.28] to play any RTS games.
[10221.36 → 10222.46] So, like, if I...
[10222.46 → 10223.96] I feel like you could do...
[10223.96 → 10225.04] I could just pick something old.
[10225.52 → 10227.78] Super Mario Bros. OG speed run.
[10229.30 → 10230.62] First five levels or something.
[10230.62 → 10231.56] It's got to be 1v1.
[10231.84 → 10232.84] It can't be...
[10233.84 → 10236.90] I could probably win Super Mario Bros. 3 battle mode, though.
[10237.92 → 10239.94] You know, the one with the like, POW thing in the middle?
[10240.06 → 10240.40] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10240.66 → 10241.88] Like, I'm pretty good.
[10242.26 → 10244.54] I'm overall a pretty good platformer player.
[10244.92 → 10247.66] And he would have to...
[10247.66 → 10250.84] He'd have to play a fair bit against people who are actually good at it
[10250.84 → 10253.46] to, like, be good at it.
[10253.46 → 10254.08] Yeah, there's no AI.
[10254.92 → 10255.16] Yep.
[10256.42 → 10259.12] And 64 Goldeneye, say people.
[10259.54 → 10260.02] Yeah, sure.
[10260.02 → 10262.04] Let's do some Pilot Wings challenges.
[10262.66 → 10263.98] Let's play Wii Sports.
[10264.12 → 10266.20] I will f*** you up at Wii Sports.
[10268.44 → 10270.04] Like, actually good.
[10270.18 → 10271.44] That could be kind of fun, actually.
[10271.48 → 10272.40] That could be kind of fun.
[10272.46 → 10273.80] We could play some Wii Sports.
[10274.02 → 10274.20] Yeah.
[10274.20 → 10278.70] Some people said Halo CE, but you'd need, like, a large team to make that work.
[10278.82 → 10278.96] Yeah.
[10278.96 → 10279.84] That might be kind of annoying.
[10280.08 → 10281.92] Yeah, that, like...
[10281.92 → 10285.36] It's an old game, but it's, like...
[10285.36 → 10289.02] It's old in a lot of good ways, but it's also old in some bad ways.
[10289.06 → 10290.42] Like, the net code sucks.
[10290.54 → 10290.72] Yeah.
[10291.02 → 10293.12] We ran into that at the LAN, even though everyone's...
[10293.12 → 10295.00] Skipping, teleporting flags, teleporting people.
[10295.14 → 10295.34] Yeah.
[10295.34 → 10295.90] Yeah.
[10295.90 → 10295.94] Yeah.
[10296.34 → 10300.12] Especially teleporting warthogs that are flying through the air, which can be very disorienting.
[10300.32 → 10300.52] Yeah.
[10302.54 → 10303.26] Bubble hockey.
[10303.42 → 10303.58] Yeah.
[10303.66 → 10307.52] I fly him out here to play Super Chen bubble hockey for the last one.
[10307.88 → 10310.26] That would be actually pretty great.
[10310.42 → 10311.98] Yeah, but that's not really a video game.
[10312.04 → 10313.00] Did he say video game?
[10313.82 → 10314.54] I don't know.
[10315.20 → 10315.44] Hmm.
[10315.70 → 10317.16] Did he say video game?
[10317.22 → 10318.84] Because, again, I would f*** him up at bubble hockey.
[10318.84 → 10320.66] The text in here says any game.
[10321.24 → 10321.56] Interesting.
[10321.80 → 10322.04] Hold on.
[10322.06 → 10322.82] I'm going to listen to it again.
[10323.98 → 10324.24] Dan?
[10325.24 → 10326.02] I'm trying.
[10326.96 → 10328.22] Do you want it to go to stream?
[10328.40 → 10328.60] No.
[10328.70 → 10329.16] Let's try that.
[10331.56 → 10332.20] No, you...
[10332.20 → 10333.02] It has to go to stream.
[10333.42 → 10333.92] Okay, fine.
[10334.00 → 10334.62] Send it to stream.
[10334.68 → 10334.88] That's fine.
[10334.88 → 10336.82] I would torch Linus.
[10336.82 → 10338.68] I think any game.
[10338.86 → 10339.82] I don't think there is a...
[10340.36 → 10341.54] Really?
[10342.94 → 10345.40] Oh, well, now things are getting fascinating.
[10345.80 → 10346.06] Super Chen.
[10346.06 → 10347.38] Super Chen bubble hockey.
[10347.38 → 10348.92] Does he have a chance?
[10350.16 → 10352.46] If we do, like, the best of seven series,
[10353.34 → 10355.44] he would have to beat me four times out of seven.
[10355.44 → 10355.86] I don't think so,
[10355.94 → 10358.88] because there are certain tactics that Linus employs,
[10359.08 → 10361.02] which I don't feel like I have to mention,
[10361.42 → 10362.64] that are quite strong.
[10364.26 → 10364.96] Any game.
[10365.02 → 10366.74] Yeah, it could be badminton, for all we know.
[10367.76 → 10368.66] That's a sport.
[10369.16 → 10370.02] That's not a game.
[10370.30 → 10370.52] No.
[10370.66 → 10371.04] You know what?
[10371.08 → 10371.90] No, not badminton.
[10372.20 → 10372.52] Okay.
[10373.34 → 10374.72] I still have to play Marquez.
[10374.72 → 10376.66] He, like, challenged me ages ago.
[10377.38 → 10379.36] Well, not challenged me,
[10379.46 → 10380.90] but, like, said, yeah, that would be fun.
[10381.30 → 10382.28] Like, his community.
[10382.98 → 10384.78] Yeah, yeah, the chat's like,
[10384.86 → 10385.90] badminton, badminton, badminton.
[10386.02 → 10387.54] Yeah, that doesn't really make sense.
[10389.76 → 10391.20] PC building simulator.
[10391.94 → 10393.16] What if he counts...
[10393.16 → 10394.70] That's a little on the nose, I think.
[10395.06 → 10395.56] You think so?
[10395.66 → 10396.34] What if he...
[10396.98 → 10397.96] Like, you could do it,
[10398.02 → 10399.46] but I feel like it's a little on the nose.
[10399.62 → 10399.86] Yeah.
[10399.92 → 10401.82] Maybe as, like, a bonus round fun thing.
[10402.68 → 10404.14] What if he counters the terms?
[10405.70 → 10406.06] Hmm.
[10406.24 → 10407.22] I think my terms are fair.
[10407.30 → 10409.98] He said he could gap me in any game.
[10411.08 → 10413.58] I mean, the fact that I'm letting him pick anything,
[10413.84 → 10416.40] I think is fairly magnanimous of me.
[10416.62 → 10416.96] Okay.
[10417.70 → 10418.16] All right.
[10418.50 → 10419.82] Yes, I pulled out that word.
[10419.94 → 10421.54] Just whipped it out there.
[10422.18 → 10422.52] All right.
[10422.52 → 10423.48] Well, fair enough.
[10425.94 → 10427.54] Is Scrapyard Wars a game?
[10427.76 → 10428.14] Hmm.
[10428.14 → 10429.70] Interesting.
[10431.86 → 10432.94] It's a game show.
[10435.44 → 10436.54] Worms Armageddon.
[10437.52 → 10438.76] Oh, that'd be kind of fun.
[10438.86 → 10439.72] I suck at it, though.
[10439.76 → 10441.82] I do kind of want to pick stuff that I'm good at.
[10442.00 → 10443.54] People are saying he's going to pick chess.
[10444.62 → 10445.02] Yeah.
[10445.72 → 10447.02] I'm going to lose at that.
[10447.50 → 10449.50] I can barely beat my 10-year-old.
[10450.30 → 10451.30] Like, for real.
[10451.74 → 10455.06] We played twice, and he won once,
[10455.06 → 10459.60] and I barely, like, snuck a checkmate the other time
[10459.60 → 10461.42] just because it was a tactic he hadn't seen before.
[10462.70 → 10463.94] Like, you know when you castle,
[10464.14 → 10466.64] there's that sort of problem with castling
[10466.64 → 10468.22] where if they can get their queen in there
[10468.22 → 10471.62] with anything backing her, you are done.
[10471.62 → 10473.08] You haven't moved a pawn up,
[10473.16 → 10474.08] so you don't have an escape route.
[10474.08 → 10475.36] Yeah, it's instant checkmate.
[10475.82 → 10477.76] He just hadn't seen it before,
[10478.08 → 10479.72] and so I, like, was way down.
[10479.86 → 10482.06] He had, like, three more meaningful pieces than I did,
[10482.12 → 10482.56] but I was like,
[10482.74 → 10484.24] see you later.
[10484.24 → 10486.06] He immediately asked for a rematch
[10486.06 → 10487.62] and immediately annihilated me.
[10488.14 → 10491.10] So, um, you should play him sometime
[10491.10 → 10492.76] because you, like, kind of know how to play.
[10493.00 → 10494.34] And he does the same thing as you
[10494.34 → 10495.34] where he just plays challenges.
[10495.46 → 10496.52] He doesn't really play full game,
[10496.58 → 10497.94] so you guys are both sort of handicapped
[10497.94 → 10498.66] in the same way.
[10498.68 → 10500.16] Yeah, neither of us know openings at all.
[10501.42 → 10501.82] Perfect.
[10502.50 → 10504.28] We'll just, like, fumble our way into the mid-game
[10504.28 → 10505.42] and then figure out how to do things.
[10505.84 → 10508.12] I'm going to go with Wii Golf.
[10509.18 → 10510.38] Wii Golf?
[10510.62 → 10511.40] Wii Sports Golf.
[10511.40 → 10511.44] Wii Golf.
[10512.00 → 10514.40] Okay, you're not doing, like, a multi-sport challenge?
[10514.52 → 10515.86] Oh, I'll do a multi-sport challenge.
[10515.94 → 10518.14] I just figure we're already playing five games at this point.
[10518.26 → 10519.20] Like, sure, we can do them.
[10519.26 → 10520.28] I'll beat them at bowling,
[10520.50 → 10521.22] I'll beat them at golf,
[10521.28 → 10522.20] and then I'll beat them at tennis.
[10522.26 → 10522.64] I don't care.
[10525.22 → 10527.18] I, there are a few videos
[10527.18 → 10528.16] that I've wanted to watch
[10528.16 → 10530.72] as much as what this one is going to turn into.
[10530.72 → 10532.64] If it turns into anything.
[10532.92 → 10533.62] I'm assuming it will.
[10534.14 → 10536.16] All right, that's my, uh, that's my gauntlet.
[10536.80 → 10538.94] I'm actually pretty good at Overcooked, too, but no.
[10539.20 → 10541.10] No, you need a good team for Overcooked.
[10541.24 → 10542.12] That's not like, yeah.
[10542.96 → 10544.38] Okay, so what were the three?
[10544.86 → 10547.44] Forged Alliance, Beat Safer, and Wii Golf.
[10547.68 → 10548.48] There you go, Ludwig.
[10548.84 → 10550.32] Gap me at any of those.
[10550.62 → 10551.36] I dare you.
[10552.06 → 10553.42] Are you going to practice at all?
[10553.88 → 10555.72] Knowing that I bet you he would.
[10556.72 → 10558.28] I have no idea, to be honest.
[10558.34 → 10559.10] I'm just saying that.
[10559.60 → 10561.34] I think the rule should be
[10561.34 → 10563.74] that you don't get to practice the games you propose.
[10564.82 → 10566.84] But I can practice the games he proposes,
[10566.84 → 10568.12] and he can practice my games.
[10568.20 → 10568.76] That seems cool.
[10569.52 → 10571.04] I think that's kind of fair,
[10571.18 → 10573.74] because it's basically supposed to be like,
[10574.42 → 10575.96] I am, like, so good at this
[10575.96 → 10578.08] that you couldn't possibly hope to beat me.
[10578.32 → 10578.86] Yeah, I will gap you.
[10578.86 → 10579.86] And if you're in a position
[10579.86 → 10581.48] where you could gig a gap someone.
[10581.60 → 10582.70] Yeah, you shouldn't need to practice.
[10582.98 → 10583.12] Yeah.
[10583.24 → 10584.54] I don't need to practice any of those.
[10584.54 → 10587.22] You are going to, like, not even be close.
[10587.58 → 10588.66] In fact, I would say,
[10588.78 → 10591.76] don't even bother trying to practice Forged Alliance.
[10591.86 → 10593.48] I was going to say Forged Alliance.
[10594.24 → 10596.38] Beat Safer, I think there's a lot of learning
[10596.38 → 10597.04] that could be done.
[10597.94 → 10598.66] There's a lot.
[10599.24 → 10599.74] There's a lot.
[10600.06 → 10601.90] Actually, Beat Safer is a challenging one, though.
[10602.00 → 10603.16] What maps would we play?
[10604.10 → 10604.44] Yeah.
[10606.08 → 10606.44] Yeah.
[10606.60 → 10608.86] Because I did have someone beat me at LTX
[10608.86 → 10610.24] on a map I had never seen.
[10610.24 → 10610.60] I was going to say,
[10610.66 → 10611.58] there's a lot of, like,
[10611.58 → 10613.08] you need to be able to anticipate things.
[10613.40 → 10614.00] They barely beat me.
[10614.00 → 10617.30] It was, like, 700,000 to 697,000
[10617.30 → 10618.14] or something like that.
[10618.18 → 10619.76] It was very close.
[10619.88 → 10620.18] Yeah, yeah.
[10620.24 → 10621.62] And I had never seen the map,
[10621.66 → 10623.30] and it was their choice of maps.
[10623.38 → 10626.32] So I did lose the challenge.
[10626.32 → 10627.48] A bunch of people are saying Crab Rave,
[10627.54 → 10628.88] but I feel like you would just get perfect.
[10630.18 → 10632.24] I don't think I've ever 100%ed Crab Rave.
[10632.32 → 10632.80] I don't, actually.
[10632.80 → 10632.96] Oh, really?
[10632.96 → 10634.84] I really enjoyed playing it earlier on
[10634.84 → 10636.60] when I was not very good yet,
[10636.98 → 10639.52] and so I have never actually 100%ed Expert Plus,
[10639.60 → 10641.16] and there's more than just 100%ing.
[10641.24 → 10643.84] You also have to slice in the correct direction,
[10643.94 → 10645.66] and you have to slice right down the middle of the block.
[10645.86 → 10646.84] So it's by score.
[10647.26 → 10649.42] I could get a perfect Crab Rave
[10649.42 → 10651.48] that's probably not even double S,
[10652.42 → 10656.06] because all that block combos do
[10656.06 → 10657.72] is they increase your score multiplier.
[10658.04 → 10660.28] You still have to actually score a lot of points
[10660.28 → 10661.32] when you strike the block.
[10661.32 → 10661.60] Yeah.
[10663.64 → 10665.34] Caramel Dawson would be my vote.
[10666.30 → 10668.50] Some people are saying LTT intro.
[10668.88 → 10670.22] Yeah, yeah, we could do Supernova.
[10670.48 → 10672.12] I'd play Supernova, no problem.
[10673.78 → 10675.90] I haven't played that in a long time,
[10676.00 → 10677.26] but I am familiar with it,
[10677.32 → 10678.40] so if he practiced up,
[10678.84 → 10680.40] maybe there's a chance that he could not lose
[10680.40 → 10681.40] completely embarrassingly.
[10684.46 → 10687.70] All right, I think it's time to switch to WAN Show after dark!
[10687.78 → 10689.92] Is there any other topics we need to blast through before we go?
[10690.24 → 10690.76] I don't know.
[10691.32 → 10693.60] Particularly any that we called it at the beginning of the show?
[10694.24 → 10694.60] Yeah.
[10695.36 → 10696.04] I don't know.
[10696.12 → 10696.74] I don't think so.
[10696.98 → 10697.58] I think we're good.
[10699.32 → 10699.68] Dan?
[10700.50 → 10701.54] He's got this, don't worry.
[10702.12 → 10702.66] Good old Dan.
[10704.66 → 10705.70] He just called you old.
[10706.98 → 10707.38] What?
[10709.10 → 10711.28] Have I heard my back and walk under the camera?
[10711.28 → 10715.20] Let me go turn off the lantern.
[10716.20 → 10717.06] Goodbye, Dan.
[10717.56 → 10719.30] We have DMX control.
[10719.30 → 10722.22] Oh, man.
[10722.22 → 10724.72] People have been messaging me.
[10725.18 → 10728.02] Nick says, bring in Shroud as a ringer.
[10728.48 → 10729.24] That's what I'm saying.
[10729.42 → 10730.94] I don't think it should be able to be anyone.
[10731.06 → 10731.70] Yeah, that's stupid.
[10731.96 → 10734.40] It's got to be teams, if there's any team games.
[10734.40 → 10735.46] Yeah, just like, hey, Corey,
[10735.54 → 10737.68] remember that one time we met when we did that video?
[10739.04 → 10739.48] Guess what?
[10739.50 → 10741.10] You're on my Overwatch squad now.
[10741.34 → 10742.56] Come on, that's just stupid.
[10742.56 → 10743.04] Yeah.
[10746.86 → 10747.26] Okay.
[10748.04 → 10750.62] Dan, we got some stuff to talk about?
[10751.02 → 10751.94] Some merch messages?
[10752.32 → 10753.54] I think I got a couple here for you.
[10753.64 → 10754.26] Hit me.
[10754.86 → 10756.16] Let's get into position.
[10756.32 → 10756.92] Here we are.
[10757.64 → 10758.58] Assume the position.
[10758.74 → 10759.70] I am assuming the position.
[10759.84 → 10760.50] Okay, here we go.
[10760.94 → 10763.38] LMG plus LDT equals nah.
[10764.02 → 10765.42] LLD equals yay.
[10766.34 → 10769.72] Luke, I hear you talking about all these self-made recipes
[10769.72 → 10770.98] that sound delicious.
[10770.98 → 10773.88] Would you ever consider making a cookbook full of them?
[10774.06 → 10774.28] Oh.
[10774.58 → 10776.84] Also, the stick locks are good fidget toys.
[10777.08 → 10779.28] Luke's cookbook would be literally a one-pager.
[10779.78 → 10782.74] It would be make chicken, get laid.
[10785.38 → 10786.04] I mean, that could be...
[10786.04 → 10786.74] Make sensual chicken.
[10786.76 → 10788.32] It is part of the recipe, okay?
[10788.68 → 10789.42] You know...
[10789.42 → 10794.32] So your cookbook is not actually how to make food.
[10794.36 → 10795.18] Made with love.
[10795.18 → 10797.18] It's how to be like a toxic...
[10798.14 → 10799.98] Ionosphere influencer.
[10800.98 → 10801.86] With chicken.
[10802.44 → 10803.44] There's food involved.
[10806.00 → 10808.42] It's funny because I was trying to think if there's any, like,
[10808.74 → 10811.52] you know, signature recipe things that I have that don't involve chicken,
[10811.64 → 10813.10] but they literally all do.
[10813.48 → 10815.00] Are there any signature recipes you have that don't...
[10815.00 → 10815.94] Wait, no, there's one.
[10816.10 → 10816.54] There's one.
[10816.72 → 10817.18] There's one.
[10817.24 → 10817.48] Okay.
[10817.88 → 10818.10] Yeah.
[10819.00 → 10819.36] Turkey?
[10820.84 → 10821.42] It's a...
[10821.42 → 10822.12] It's a BLT.
[10822.76 → 10823.50] Oh my god.
[10823.50 → 10825.30] I used to make BLTs when I was in high school.
[10825.30 → 10826.78] A BLT is not a signature recipe.
[10826.90 → 10827.52] No, it was cool.
[10828.34 → 10831.64] I put, like, probably eight times the amount of lettuce people normally do.
[10832.04 → 10832.90] Was it inside out?
[10833.10 → 10833.44] Okay.
[10833.78 → 10835.22] And it was on a blueberry bun.
[10836.54 → 10837.46] Does that make sense?
[10837.54 → 10837.72] No.
[10838.16 → 10839.76] No, that actually sounds horrible.
[10839.88 → 10840.76] It's what was available.
[10841.02 → 10841.82] I was in high school.
[10841.88 → 10842.16] Okay.
[10842.16 → 10843.14] That's not a recipe.
[10843.46 → 10843.58] Yeah?
[10843.70 → 10844.98] And that definitely won't get you laid.
[10844.98 → 10846.40] When you're padding out a recipe bun.
[10848.00 → 10849.16] Well, we're at two pages.
[10849.32 → 10850.34] You got a ways to go.
[10850.36 → 10852.44] Mac and cheese with four kinds of cheese.
[10852.66 → 10854.42] An entire bottle of Red Hot.
[10855.40 → 10855.84] Yeah.
[10856.58 → 10858.82] Mac and cheese with cheese and ketchup.
[10859.74 → 10860.72] Oh, fancy.
[10861.00 → 10861.40] Fancy.
[10861.80 → 10862.48] Yeah, no.
[10863.08 → 10865.24] Yeah, I really don't have enough to do that.
[10865.56 → 10869.94] I have a short list that I continuously go back to, and that's about it.
[10872.16 → 10872.80] Okay.
[10872.90 → 10873.58] Oh, boy.
[10874.12 → 10874.66] Hello, DLL.
[10875.06 → 10880.52] If direct storage takes off, do you think this will change GPU architecture, and if so, how?
[10883.90 → 10888.68] Man, the only thing I can really think of is them trying to get away with putting less VRAM on their cards.
[10890.06 → 10892.02] I don't think you can add less to them now.
[10892.58 → 10892.90] Yeah.
[10893.34 → 10893.98] So there's that.
[10894.44 → 10895.24] Do you see the rumours?
[10895.24 → 10896.50] And they're very much rumours.
[10897.38 → 10898.40] But do you see the rumours?
[10898.54 → 10901.56] NVIDIA is basically, like, not bothering to produce 40 series at this point.
[10901.56 → 10902.04] Right.
[10902.04 → 10906.40] And they're just trying to shift all of their production, all of their fab time to...
[10906.40 → 10907.08] I'm not surprised.
[10907.10 → 10907.68] AI cards, yeah.
[10908.14 → 10912.34] It's one of those rumours where it is not confirmed at all, but it's like...
[10912.34 → 10912.64] Yep.
[10913.52 → 10913.78] Hey.
[10913.96 → 10914.66] That makes sense.
[10914.74 → 10917.34] This thing makes way more money right now.
[10917.88 → 10919.12] Maybe we should make more of it.
[10919.12 → 10923.40] And there is completely an unhinged level of demand for it.
[10923.40 → 10931.16] Meanwhile, your consumers in this business unit absolutely hate your guts, and your products are lame.
[10932.14 → 10932.74] Yeah.
[10933.06 → 10933.40] Anywho.
[10934.14 → 10934.48] Yep.
[10934.48 → 10937.96] Hi, DLL.
[10937.96 → 10944.32] I just finished an internship working on detecting and analyzing defects in transistors at NIST.
[10944.76 → 10945.04] Question.
[10945.68 → 10951.96] Any thoughts on Microsoft pushing ARM adoption faster to catch up to Apple on battery life?
[10952.04 → 10953.92] There's only so much Microsoft can do, right?
[10953.98 → 10955.74] It's like developers, developers, developers.
[10955.96 → 10958.46] They're so reliant on the ecosystem.
[10958.46 → 10961.60] And the ecosystem has such a long tail.
[10961.78 → 10963.78] Like, it's such a big ship, and it's hard to move.
[10963.88 → 10971.36] I don't know how much Microsoft can actually do to incentivize developers beyond what they've already done,
[10971.42 → 10975.12] which is creating a platform for them to develop for, creating tools for them to develop,
[10975.60 → 10979.56] and even in some cases, incentivizing them through partnership, through promotion,
[10979.70 → 10982.40] and through direct cash funding to develop for the platform.
[10982.40 → 10989.76] It's just going to be a slow, slow, slow move, because Microsoft is a system integrator,
[10989.84 → 10991.40] but they aren't even a main...
[10991.92 → 10997.68] They're not a main system integrator in the Windows ecosystem, so there's just only so much they can do.
[10999.54 → 11004.64] Since Luke is getting invites to go to all these cool places, will we get a new series?
[11004.96 → 11006.14] Luke Goes Places?
[11008.50 → 11012.10] I mean, I'd be down, but I don't think it makes sense.
[11012.10 → 11016.28] It would be kind of sucky for him to, like, take vacation time and then have to make a video.
[11016.78 → 11017.70] I'd still be down.
[11017.94 → 11020.78] Yeah, I know you would, but it's like the volunteers in the community.
[11020.98 → 11022.72] Like, I don't want to ask you to do that.
[11022.98 → 11026.80] Although, you will potentially be getting a series called Linus is on Vacation,
[11027.40 → 11029.36] and is doing stuff at his house that he wants to do,
[11029.40 → 11032.62] instead of going to the office and doing work things, but we're going to point a camera at it.
[11033.90 → 11036.06] I already have, like, three projects planned.
[11036.70 → 11039.42] Because it's just stuffed I want to do when I have my two weeks off,
[11039.42 → 11042.32] and, like, you might as well just point a frigging camera at it.
[11042.32 → 11042.72] I don't care.
[11043.00 → 11046.62] So we're going to get, like, maybe we'll release weekly or something like that,
[11046.62 → 11052.30] so it's not just a bunch of days in a row of, like, Linus organizing his, like, tech room in his basement or whatever,
[11052.78 → 11056.18] or, like, Linus mounting all of his stupid Sonos things to the wall.
[11056.36 → 11062.44] But it means that I can get some help from work people to do stuff that I would have to do at my house anyway by myself,
[11062.44 → 11065.54] and it means that the company gets content, so everyone wins.
[11065.62 → 11068.62] I have not cleared this with our new CEO, but hopefully he's fine with it.
[11069.90 → 11071.78] Dan, you're probably going to get recruited to help.
[11072.28 → 11075.96] I have a body bag of stuff for your theatre room.
[11076.40 → 11077.90] A body bag of stuff?
[11077.90 → 11080.44] I don't even know about this project, so that's four.
[11080.70 → 11082.70] You asked me to do it last September.
[11083.02 → 11084.20] Oh, that explains why.
[11084.42 → 11086.02] Wait, you have stuff for that?
[11086.66 → 11086.82] Yes.
[11086.82 → 11088.42] I thought we were waiting on more stuff for that.
[11088.76 → 11089.24] We are.
[11089.24 → 11091.82] There's a lot of stuff that has to stuff for that project.
[11092.34 → 11094.96] Oh, so are we doing any of it, then, or some of it, or, like, what?
[11095.02 → 11096.22] I think we need to talk about that.
[11096.26 → 11099.12] I've got another project that I have to finish off for you probably next week,
[11099.24 → 11101.70] but the rest of it is a bit more complicated.
[11101.92 → 11102.48] Okay, cool.
[11103.96 → 11104.68] Yeah, I don't know.
[11105.28 → 11111.02] One thing that I do want to do and did actually do this is when I do these weird adventure things,
[11111.06 → 11112.90] I'm kind of scouting for video ideas.
[11114.04 → 11116.90] I am fully planning that the...
[11116.90 → 11119.22] I don't know which one.
[11119.26 → 11122.36] I was thinking the Artemis mission where they, like, actually land.
[11123.10 → 11130.56] Doing a video on designing the mission control centre for that and, like, why they choose different, like,
[11130.92 → 11135.12] versions of these crazy screen setups that they have and how they're...
[11135.12 → 11140.46] Like, how data is going back and forth between the rocket and how they're dealing with data once they land
[11140.46 → 11141.26] and all this other kind of stuff.
[11141.40 → 11142.58] Could be very interesting.
[11142.58 → 11144.94] I actually do think there's a video there.
[11145.12 → 11148.76] I think a lot of the places that I would go to, there really wouldn't be a video there, though,
[11149.04 → 11151.54] because we're, like, not going to be allowed to film stuff.
[11152.54 → 11154.48] So, yeah, I don't know.
[11155.60 → 11157.42] I'm always down for whatever.
[11157.76 → 11161.04] I just don't think it makes a ton of sense all the time.
[11161.04 → 11163.58] I just replied to a merch message where I addressed only part of it.
[11163.58 → 11170.58] So, about my current monitor, which is the 144Hz 42-inch OLED that...
[11170.58 → 11171.20] Is it 42?
[11172.10 → 11172.48] Crap.
[11172.62 → 11173.12] Now I forget.
[11173.22 → 11174.22] I think it's 42 inches.
[11174.32 → 11178.44] Anyway, the DOG one, the OLED, the big one.
[11180.00 → 11181.92] Overall, I'm still really happy with it.
[11182.00 → 11183.76] I wish the refresh rate was a little bit higher.
[11183.88 → 11186.18] 120 is, like, really, really, really, really, perfect.
[11186.18 → 11189.36] Um, or 144 or whatever it is.
[11189.48 → 11190.20] I think, is it 120?
[11190.32 → 11190.82] I can't remember.
[11190.92 → 11192.06] It's either 120 or 144.
[11192.46 → 11193.92] It's super, super awesome.
[11194.26 → 11200.90] But having the Corsair Flex one at the LAN, I was like, yeah, 240 would be a little bit smoother
[11200.90 → 11202.18] and is pretty nice.
[11203.06 → 11205.90] Um, overall, really happy with it.
[11205.96 → 11207.74] Haven't had any permanent burn-in yet.
[11208.80 → 11210.40] But, hey, let's see how it goes.
[11210.40 → 11220.04] Linus has shared some notoriously bad takes about software, especially on feature development complexity.
[11220.80 → 11225.10] Luke, how often do you push back on Linus' feature requests because they are unreasonable?
[11228.48 → 11229.30] I don't.
[11229.54 → 11233.80] Not to go after someone who sent a merge message, I don't think the initial statement is all that true.
[11234.70 → 11236.20] I think it happens sometimes.
[11236.80 → 11237.52] But, you know.
[11237.52 → 11244.24] Um, I push back on feature requests pretty often, but it's usually more of a like, okay,
[11244.24 → 11245.44] this will take X amount of time.
[11245.52 → 11247.80] Would you rather us do that over these other things?
[11247.80 → 11249.42] And he's like, oh, no.
[11250.00 → 11251.30] And then that's usually how it goes.
[11251.72 → 11259.28] I mean, like, I've had some not entirely accurate takes on, like, feature development complexity.
[11259.62 → 11263.80] Like I've said, I think someone could probably add T9 dialling to iOS in a day.
[11264.12 → 11265.90] And, okay, yeah, you're right.
[11265.90 → 11269.82] With all the various validation steps, it would probably take more than a day.
[11269.82 → 11275.52] But I also think that someone could hack it, like, cheaply, scrappily put it in a day.
[11275.62 → 11278.50] Yeah, I do actually believe that.
[11279.14 → 11285.58] I also think that Google could probably figure out the, you know, taking whatever you've said phonetically
[11285.58 → 11294.84] and creating a phonetic library of all the people in your contacts list to make local searching with voice and local calling a lot easier.
[11294.92 → 11297.82] I think they could do that very easily given the technology they have.
[11297.86 → 11299.84] But that's not just me pulling something out of my butt.
[11300.00 → 11308.42] That's that they obviously, obviously, like, have all this technology.
[11308.42 → 11310.20] They just choose not to implement it.
[11310.22 → 11314.72] And it's really frustrating because there's no reason that it should be this bad other than that they just don't give an f***.
[11316.10 → 11316.84] I don't know.
[11317.60 → 11323.86] But, yeah, I do also understand that the software development pipeline is a lot simpler than a developer just being like,
[11323.98 → 11325.16] I'm going to make this tool.
[11325.30 → 11326.30] A lot more complicated, you mean?
[11327.26 → 11327.72] What did I say?
[11327.80 → 11328.64] You said a lot simpler.
[11329.08 → 11329.64] Oh, yeah.
[11330.14 → 11331.14] Yes, a lot more complicated.
[11331.14 → 11334.10] It is very late and this has been a very long week.
[11334.38 → 11334.96] Oh, yeah.
[11335.48 → 11336.36] Oh, yeah.
[11337.52 → 11341.86] As an engineering student, I'm always interested in the design process.
[11342.30 → 11347.18] Can you share some insights into how your team approaches designing and prototyping new products?
[11347.46 → 11349.18] Does any step surprise you?
[11349.70 → 11351.32] You should check out the newsletter.
[11352.46 → 11352.76] Yeah.
[11352.90 → 11359.12] There are a bunch of cool newsletters from the Creator Warehouse team where they've detailed, like, a lot of stuff.
[11359.56 → 11360.72] I think there's a lot more information.
[11360.72 → 11363.82] I have never checked out another newsletter, so I don't know.
[11363.90 → 11369.54] But I'm just going to go on a whim and assume that there's more information in ours than in a lot of different brands' newsletters.
[11370.10 → 11371.18] It's good stuff.
[11371.24 → 11371.82] It's interesting.
[11372.06 → 11373.68] We haven't done too many of them lately.
[11374.08 → 11376.60] They should be coming back stronger in the future.
[11377.40 → 11383.12] But another place where you'll find good resources for this is our float plane exclusives.
[11383.26 → 11383.56] Hey.
[11383.86 → 11387.16] The extras from building Carl Jacobs' $100,000 desk PC.
[11387.16 → 11391.48] Hey, speaking of Tim, there he is working frigging hard making that thing happen.
[11391.56 → 11392.46] That was awesome.
[11392.68 → 11393.02] Hell yeah.
[11393.20 → 11395.62] A lot of the tours behind the design.
[11395.76 → 11397.18] LTT Stubby Screwdriver.
[11397.18 → 11403.30] Let's see if I can find some more of the more, like, engineering-focused stuff.
[11403.40 → 11406.86] I know, oh, RF Chamber Tour with Jake Danes from the Labs team.
[11408.28 → 11410.04] Where's another product development one?
[11411.22 → 11419.24] Kyle almost certainly, I'm not allowed to watch these, but Kyle almost certainly talked about product development in his Working for LMG Full Uncut Interviews video.
[11419.24 → 11429.20] It's interesting because with the watch progress feature, we can see what things the LTT crew has watched exclusives of and how much of it they watched.
[11429.38 → 11432.62] Unless they finished them, in which case, do they show up full bar?
[11432.62 → 11432.94] That's true.
[11433.12 → 11433.88] No, it goes away.
[11433.96 → 11435.14] Yeah, so I don't know.
[11435.14 → 11435.82] I'm pretty sure, at least.
[11436.00 → 11436.64] I'm trying to find...
[11436.64 → 11437.86] Oh, yeah, this was cool.
[11438.48 → 11440.30] Our injection older test run.
[11441.00 → 11442.22] So, yeah, it's not all the time.
[11442.38 → 11445.82] Like, that's only four or five pieces of content over five months or whatever it is.
[11445.82 → 11446.84] It happens pretty consistently.
[11447.08 → 11450.12] But it does happen, and if it's something that you're going to see...
[11450.12 → 11451.18] We saw the monitor in half.
[11451.28 → 11451.72] Why is?
[11451.76 → 11452.46] That's for Tynan.
[11453.20 → 11457.98] Oh, Kyle talked a lot about screwdriver development in his 30-minute Meet the Team.
[11459.54 → 11466.94] So, yeah, there is stuff in there, and honestly, I think Float plane has become a better value than ever before.
[11467.50 → 11468.08] The bar stays.
[11468.08 → 11469.72] People also have personal accounts, though.
[11471.06 → 11472.02] So, like...
[11472.02 → 11475.80] Yeah, you can see in the Float plane chat that a lot of our team has personal accounts.
[11475.82 → 11476.26] Yeah.
[11477.16 → 11478.18] So, I don't know.
[11480.68 → 11481.22] Hey, DLL.
[11481.52 → 11486.50] I work at a startup company with 100-plus employees and no IT department.
[11486.92 → 11487.32] Nice.
[11487.98 → 11489.66] I'm working to build it from scratch.
[11489.90 → 11494.12] Do you plan to make more content on your internal IT struggles or best practices?
[11494.46 → 11497.38] Well, you won't find any best practices from us right now.
[11497.52 → 11498.76] That's something we're working on.
[11498.88 → 11499.54] Ha ha ha ha!
[11500.50 → 11503.94] Is our guy still on 90-day?
[11505.12 → 11506.70] Yeah, but it's, like, pretty close.
[11506.80 → 11507.26] But yes, he is.
[11507.26 → 11513.30] The plan is eventually that we want the infrastructure team to feed content to the video creation team.
[11513.30 → 11513.64] Yeah.
[11513.64 → 11518.98] Instead of the video creation team needing to try to extract content out of the infrastructure that we have.
[11520.36 → 11521.38] Are we there yet?
[11522.26 → 11523.32] Solid lead, no.
[11523.86 → 11525.24] But that is the plan.
[11525.38 → 11526.06] We will get there.
[11526.06 → 11528.30] Hello, LLD.
[11529.02 → 11533.06] Linus, you're only allowed to play one game from SNES for the rest of your life.
[11533.52 → 11535.46] It can't be Final Fantasy VI.
[11536.26 → 11537.00] What's your choice?
[11537.20 → 11537.70] Oh, come on.
[11537.72 → 11539.38] I'm just going to take the easy cop-out answer.
[11539.48 → 11540.24] Super Mario World.
[11541.00 → 11543.06] Like, that game is so...
[11544.40 → 11545.56] I was going to say good.
[11545.76 → 11546.52] No, it's great.
[11546.90 → 11548.20] It's almost perfect.
[11548.42 → 11549.14] It's incredible.
[11549.36 → 11550.42] It's an amazing game.
[11550.42 → 11565.14] Nintendo, for all their flaws, boy, do they ever have a long and proud history of just making the crap out of incredible games that are just so much better than what others are doing at the time.
[11567.54 → 11567.94] Yeah.
[11568.84 → 11570.30] I mean, I could have gone, I don't know.
[11571.04 → 11573.12] I haven't even played that many SNES games.
[11573.22 → 11574.24] Most of them were garbage.
[11576.38 → 11577.26] Super Mario World.
[11577.26 → 11582.38] Yeah, because I feel like it's one of those games where the more time you put into it, the more you could get better at it.
[11582.42 → 11585.46] Whereas, like, something like, okay, like Pilotings is one I mentioned earlier in the show.
[11585.78 → 11587.26] You could 100% it.
[11587.74 → 11590.10] And then there's no much better to get at it.
[11590.14 → 11590.58] That's it.
[11590.88 → 11594.14] Whereas, like, Super Mario World, you could always speed run it faster.
[11594.66 → 11594.82] Yeah.
[11595.46 → 11596.38] Yeah, let's go with that.
[11596.90 → 11598.36] Do different weird challenge runs.
[11598.72 → 11600.96] Donkey Kong Country greater than Super Mario.
[11601.20 → 11601.60] No.
[11603.10 → 11603.50] No.
[11603.50 → 11607.40] And Super Mario RPG, yeah, it's like a good answer for one play through.
[11607.56 → 11612.52] It's a fantastic game once, but the story's not very deep, and there's not a lot of variation in the gameplay.
[11612.66 → 11614.26] There's no way I would want to play that game forever.
[11616.62 → 11617.56] Hello, LLD.
[11617.80 → 11625.66] I work in a weird subfield of IT, designing access control and VMS solutions for big companies and entire cities.
[11626.02 → 11629.44] What are some weird areas of IT you guys want to learn more about?
[11629.44 → 11629.52] What?
[11633.50 → 11634.14] Hmm.
[11636.02 → 11639.06] I watched a like, I don't know if it was a real doc.
[11639.52 → 11643.06] Real doc as in, like, how do I say this?
[11643.62 → 11645.68] I don't think it's less real because it's on YouTube.
[11645.98 → 11652.54] I don't know if it was a documentary that was filmed for, like, TV and then brought to YouTube,
[11652.54 → 11654.96] or if it was a YouTube creator that made the doc.
[11654.96 → 11668.28] But I watched a doc a while ago that was fascinating to me that was on, like, old school, like, what is it, AT&T and Bell Technologies running undersea cables for telephones.
[11668.74 → 11672.36] That was wildly, wildly interesting to me.
[11672.36 → 11677.52] I've heard that there's, like, one incoming cable to Greenland, and that's it.
[11678.18 → 11680.20] And there's one, like, station that deals with it.
[11680.26 → 11684.20] And if that station goes down, there's effectively one person that can fix it.
[11684.28 → 11686.48] So there are a lot of single points of failure there.
[11688.98 → 11689.92] Yeah, I don't know.
[11689.92 → 11700.28] I think, like, big, big, very, very, very low-level internet infrastructure would be something that'd be very interesting to learn more about.
[11702.18 → 11705.44] You rarely hear a lot about it, really.
[11706.96 → 11715.92] But, like, it's one of those things where, like, you don't really hear a lot about some of that deep infrastructure stuff in a bunch of different realms.
[11715.92 → 11720.14] But if it was, like, ever a huge problem, it would be incredibly catastrophic.
[11720.44 → 11721.86] But it just never really is.
[11722.50 → 11726.70] Which is, like, wow, I'm really happy whoever's doing that is doing a good job.
[11729.76 → 11738.70] From an employer perspective, as a female developer, I am feeling discriminated and tempted to apply with a fake male name.
[11738.94 → 11741.92] Would this be a deal-breaker on an interview for you?
[11742.24 → 11743.66] Any other thoughts about this?
[11743.66 → 11745.92] I read this, and I thought this was very interesting.
[11746.06 → 11746.26] Yeah.
[11748.28 → 11749.04] Very interesting.
[11749.30 → 11752.36] I mean, I don't do interviews anymore, so I'm waiting for you to answer it.
[11752.36 → 11755.80] Yeah, because, like, my gut reaction was, like, no.
[11755.96 → 11759.84] Like, if you feel like you're getting discriminated against, get that interview, you know?
[11760.58 → 11761.96] But then I was sitting here thinking, like...
[11761.96 → 11765.32] But then on the flip side, would you hire someone who started their relationship with you by lying to you?
[11765.54 → 11766.18] Well, you did.
[11767.86 → 11769.56] Yeah, but I have terrible taste.
[11769.56 → 11770.20] I have great taste.
[11771.52 → 11772.56] Yeah, and it's...
[11772.56 → 11776.56] I would be pretty concerned about...
[11778.08 → 11779.20] I have great taste.
[11779.26 → 11782.48] Like, you thought that I would discriminate against you?
[11782.74 → 11784.44] But they don't know that it's you necessarily.
[11784.44 → 11784.98] Like, you think that of me?
[11785.10 → 11787.90] Yeah, but they don't know that it's you reviewing every resume.
[11789.28 → 11790.30] And it's not even.
[11790.74 → 11792.12] It goes through a layer in HR.
[11792.38 → 11793.06] That is true.
[11793.54 → 11794.12] So who knows?
[11794.12 → 11795.82] It's like...
[11795.82 → 11798.34] But then you think that of this company.
[11798.48 → 11799.18] Yeah, but that's...
[11799.18 → 11799.38] Okay.
[11800.08 → 11804.10] You know what's hilarious about this is we went through this whole thing with the Trust Me Bro ordeal.
[11804.86 → 11808.74] Where I went, we have a long track record of being pretty cool.
[11809.90 → 11812.88] Also, we're pretty not completely f***ING stupid.
[11813.44 → 11818.46] So we know that if we were to ever mistreat our community, there would be a hell storm.
[11819.00 → 11822.10] So we are A, pretty cool, and B, not stupid.
[11822.48 → 11823.82] Of course we're going to take care of it.
[11823.86 → 11825.28] We don't actually have a choice.
[11826.70 → 11832.18] Because the crap storm was either going to be over us not agreeing to address it,
[11832.22 → 11834.42] or it was going to be over us not addressing it.
[11834.42 → 11838.58] It was going to happen at some point if we didn't always put the community first and take care of our community.
[11838.78 → 11841.58] But like, f***ING obviously.
[11842.46 → 11842.64] Right?
[11843.76 → 11846.72] And yet, look at how that turned out.
[11846.92 → 11847.08] Yeah.
[11847.08 → 11848.48] Someone in Flow plane Chat said,
[11848.58 → 11852.02] My wife has used her initials and got much higher responses in agriculture.
[11853.16 → 11853.48] There you go.
[11853.58 → 11857.10] Oh, I could definitely see agriculture being a boys club.
[11857.36 → 11857.60] Yeah.
[11858.58 → 11859.54] Yeah, I don't know.
[11859.64 → 11862.22] I'm trying to think about what I would think about it.
[11862.30 → 11864.10] I don't think I would really care.
[11865.86 → 11872.46] But I might, in the interview, question the motive and see what the response is.
[11874.12 → 11875.62] Like, hey, why did you do this?
[11875.72 → 11875.90] Yeah.
[11875.90 → 11877.36] And you'd expect a good answer.
[11877.64 → 11877.88] Yeah.
[11878.26 → 11878.56] Okay.
[11878.74 → 11882.24] But if the answer is good, then I think I wouldn't care.
[11882.88 → 11883.28] Yeah.
[11887.00 → 11887.44] Okay.
[11887.68 → 11888.12] Next.
[11888.40 → 11888.64] Yeah.
[11888.64 → 11893.58] Luke, have you tried the other two systems that use the same Star Wars mechanics?
[11893.58 → 11897.50] One's for playing rebel leaders and one's for force users.
[11897.68 → 11898.24] They're fun.
[11898.76 → 11899.64] No, I haven't.
[11899.74 → 11903.46] I've heard about them, and they sound cool.
[11903.46 → 11915.40] Having played the game, I think the idea of being a force user in that universe would not feel as good, I think.
[11915.52 → 11919.18] I liked being of the people and trying to scrap it out and make it work.
[11919.18 → 11921.48] But having not played them, I don't know.
[11923.78 → 11928.50] Man, now this is bringing me back to like, okay, what determined like force aptitude?
[11928.58 → 11930.00] There was definitely a character sheet.
[11930.00 → 11931.00] Okay.
[11933.46 → 11933.78] Okay.
[11933.90 → 11938.24] And you had a certain number of like skill points that you could assign, but not digital.
[11938.82 → 11939.64] It sounds extreme.
[11939.74 → 11941.66] Well, it wasn't digital in the game that I'm talking about either.
[11941.96 → 11942.68] It's tabletop RPG.
[11942.86 → 11943.28] It's all paper.
[11943.40 → 11943.54] Yeah.
[11943.54 → 11945.44] But I played, it was single player though.
[11945.64 → 11945.86] Yeah.
[11946.44 → 11946.82] No, I think.
[11947.58 → 11947.98] Oh yeah.
[11948.00 → 11949.06] You weren't sure if you found it.
[11949.84 → 11950.48] I don't know.
[11950.72 → 11951.48] Ah, anyway.
[11953.88 → 11954.92] Hey, LLD.
[11955.24 → 11959.52] Wondering if you know any games or companies who do legacy content right.
[11959.52 → 11968.44] Old Microsoft versions are broken in the stock launcher, and we all know how lacking Nintendo's retro selection is.
[11968.44 → 11973.52] Whoever the heck was the original owner of what FAF became.
[11974.26 → 11974.56] Oh yeah.
[11974.64 → 11978.38] That's like a picture-perfect version.
[11978.70 → 11978.92] Yeah.
[11979.12 → 11985.30] Because you can't expect these developers, publishers, whatever to maintain these games forever.
[11985.48 → 11986.50] You actually just can't.
[11986.54 → 11987.10] It's not fair.
[11988.36 → 11994.64] But we have always said that at that point, if you're not going to maintain it anymore, you should release it to the community.
[11994.64 → 12000.86] And I don't know what their exact terms are, but it verifies that you own the game and the game is still purchasable.
[12001.70 → 12006.54] And then you can install it and use this community ran launcher.
[12006.88 → 12007.00] Yeah.
[12007.12 → 12008.74] And it's just awesome.
[12009.76 → 12011.02] And the game's fun.
[12011.16 → 12013.48] So I don't, I'm not necessarily asking to get it for free.
[12013.60 → 12014.70] Like it doesn't need to be that.
[12014.88 → 12018.98] I'm totally okay with it verifying that I own the game, and it's great.
[12019.10 → 12019.96] So that's sweet.
[12020.28 → 12020.50] Yeah.
[12020.60 → 12022.78] I think you said gas power games.
[12023.06 → 12023.50] Yeah.
[12023.50 → 12023.82] Sweet.
[12023.82 → 12024.74] Well, that was the publisher.
[12024.90 → 12028.74] I don't actually know what the I don't know who the agreement had to be with.
[12028.86 → 12029.06] Yeah.
[12029.46 → 12029.74] Sure.
[12029.88 → 12030.24] Fair enough.
[12031.46 → 12032.50] Whatever that was though.
[12032.84 → 12033.22] Awesome.
[12035.10 → 12038.86] Convince the wife that the new office needs matching desk pads.
[12039.50 → 12042.94] What are some of your favourite small or even pyrrhic victories?
[12043.66 → 12044.20] Oh no, sorry.
[12044.28 → 12045.72] Gas Powered Games was the developer.
[12046.08 → 12048.92] So I don't know who published Supreme Commander.
[12048.92 → 12053.52] Hold on one sec.
[12055.66 → 12056.46] Wait, what?
[12060.10 → 12060.42] THE?
[12060.56 → 12061.58] Actually, that does sound right.
[12061.84 → 12062.20] THE.
[12065.16 → 12065.48] Yeah.
[12065.78 → 12066.00] Yeah.
[12066.04 → 12066.40] THE.
[12067.04 → 12069.28] So I don't, I don't know how that whole thing went down exactly.
[12069.56 → 12070.88] I'm sure those folks would know.
[12071.60 → 12071.84] Okay.
[12071.92 → 12072.12] Sorry.
[12072.18 → 12072.60] What was that Dan?
[12074.12 → 12076.98] Convince the wife that the new office needs matching desk pads.
[12077.08 → 12077.36] Heck yeah.
[12077.76 → 12080.86] What are some of your favourite small or maybe even pyrrhic victories?
[12082.34 → 12088.02] Small victories or victories that inflicted damage on the victor.
[12089.70 → 12090.78] Fantastic word, by the way.
[12090.84 → 12091.18] Good use.
[12092.18 → 12092.52] Yeah, I know.
[12092.56 → 12093.26] I knew that one, actually.
[12094.06 → 12094.94] Just making sure.
[12094.94 → 12102.98] I'm sure there's been tons through work.
[12103.06 → 12107.32] What's a small and meaningless victory that we've ever, that we've.
[12108.98 → 12110.98] Well, he said, he said or, right?
[12111.24 → 12111.62] Yeah.
[12111.78 → 12114.94] Small or, or damage inflicting victory.
[12116.06 → 12120.06] I feel like we kind of embrace the small victories though.
[12120.06 → 12124.68] Um, man, I'm just trying to think.
[12124.80 → 12126.50] I also feel like both of us.
[12127.08 → 12129.00] Have we ever gone to war with a sponsor?
[12129.28 → 12129.88] Oh, okay.
[12130.60 → 12131.54] Uh, yeah.
[12131.76 → 12132.00] NVIDIA.
[12132.14 → 12133.00] It's not really a victory.
[12134.52 → 12134.88] Um.
[12134.96 → 12135.54] Yeah, I don't know.
[12136.14 → 12139.00] No, see, that's the thing is like, there are so many different ways to define victory.
[12139.10 → 12143.96] Like if you're talking about the hardware unboxed thing, like we were victorious in the sense
[12143.96 → 12149.12] that they got back re-engaged with NVIDIA and everything was fine and NVIDIA apologized
[12149.12 → 12150.12] and everything was fine.
[12150.52 → 12150.70] Yeah.
[12150.82 → 12153.28] So we were not victorious in terms of making money.
[12154.18 → 12154.58] Yeah.
[12154.80 → 12154.96] Right.
[12155.00 → 12159.00] So it inflicted damage, but it's not like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't classify
[12159.00 → 12159.50] it this way.
[12159.60 → 12164.34] I want like a, a small or damage inflicting victory.
[12164.46 → 12167.40] What, what things have like damaged us over the years?
[12168.52 → 12176.08] I feel like both of us are fairly rapidly willing to self-sacrifice if we can win something.
[12176.20 → 12177.94] So we probably have lots of examples.
[12178.22 → 12178.68] I'm sure we've done something.
[12178.68 → 12181.26] But I'm sure neither of us cared about whatever.
[12181.30 → 12181.48] Yeah.
[12181.52 → 12182.74] Because there was some other goal.
[12182.96 → 12183.42] Yeah, exactly.
[12183.42 → 12185.76] Like the victory was worth far more than any damage could have possibly.
[12185.76 → 12188.04] So we just forgot about the damage, and we're like, woo!
[12188.56 → 12188.92] Yeah.
[12189.00 → 12193.30] I got, uh, by my team captain on softball night, I got assigned to shortstop because he
[12193.30 → 12196.64] was just like, yeah, I love the way you just throw your body in front of the ball with
[12196.64 → 12199.06] absolutely no regard for how hard it's going to hit you.
[12199.06 → 12200.62] I'm like, yeah, the glove is optional.
[12200.80 → 12201.02] Yeah.
[12201.62 → 12202.02] Yeah.
[12202.32 → 12202.58] Yeah.
[12202.58 → 12205.42] And you'll forget about the hand pain.
[12206.04 → 12206.40] Oh no.
[12206.48 → 12208.84] It was like, I took one in the shins right before that.
[12209.06 → 12209.32] Yeah.
[12209.32 → 12211.80] Because I was just like, well, that's what they teach you.
[12212.00 → 12216.26] I mean, you don't go down, you don't go down like this because, you know, even a cup is
[12216.26 → 12216.96] not perfect.
[12217.12 → 12218.28] You go down like this.
[12218.34 → 12218.62] Right.
[12218.62 → 12221.94] And so like, I, so I missed with my glove, and it like wailed me right in the shins,
[12222.04 → 12224.64] made the play, which is all that matters.
[12224.78 → 12224.96] Yeah.
[12225.62 → 12226.48] Nothing else matters.
[12226.62 → 12229.16] I feel like we're going to forget all of those forms of victories.
[12229.80 → 12231.28] Um, yeah, I don't know.
[12233.28 → 12238.16] Uh, I give up.
[12238.38 → 12238.80] I'm sorry.
[12238.92 → 12239.66] I actually don't know.
[12239.66 → 12241.02] I don't know why this was so hard to answer, but it just.
[12241.02 → 12241.82] Yeah, it shouldn't have been.
[12241.94 → 12242.18] Yeah.
[12242.60 → 12243.16] It just is.
[12243.64 → 12244.62] Maybe we're just tired.
[12244.62 → 12250.54] Hi, LLD Linus, during the sponsor shopping video, you made a point to call out anchor,
[12250.78 → 12255.48] but in a Yvonne's tech upgrade video, she had new anchor chargers.
[12255.68 → 12259.62] Is this a Linus versus LMG thing or an oversight?
[12260.40 → 12263.64] Um, we just aren't accepting any sponsorships.
[12263.70 → 12264.62] We're not partnered with them.
[12264.72 → 12269.26] That doesn't mean that they don't make perfectly competent products that might suit our needs
[12269.26 → 12270.02] and we might buy them.
[12271.32 → 12273.42] I've never, that's not inconsistent.
[12273.42 → 12277.84] That's, uh, ever since we announced that we wouldn't be working with them anymore.
[12278.68 → 12283.26] That's a line that we drew at that time that we, yeah, we still continue to use it.
[12283.32 → 12287.38] We're just not going to give them any free publicity or any paid publicity, actually,
[12287.46 → 12288.64] especially the paid publicity.
[12288.64 → 12290.10] We're not going to partner with them anymore.
[12290.86 → 12293.50] So yes, I guess free publicity is still on the table.
[12294.86 → 12295.90] Hello, everyone.
[12295.90 → 12302.58] Do you know why when two people call each other at the same time, the phones mark as unavailable
[12302.58 → 12304.98] instead of just connecting the calls to each other?
[12305.18 → 12308.50] I don't know, but I curated this because I want to know.
[12308.96 → 12310.08] Um, yeah.
[12310.66 → 12311.80] Why is that?
[12311.98 → 12312.30] What?
[12312.58 → 12315.32] I think it's a holdover from when they were physical.
[12315.50 → 12315.76] Yeah.
[12315.76 → 12318.52] But if two people are calling each other at the same time, didn't it just connect the
[12318.52 → 12319.00] bloody call?
[12319.10 → 12320.92] Why did they, why do they both get a busy signal?
[12322.94 → 12323.26] Right?
[12323.36 → 12324.70] Isn't it all digital these days?
[12325.70 → 12327.54] Oh, you mean like, why does that still happen?
[12327.64 → 12327.94] Yeah.
[12329.30 → 12330.28] That's wild, right?
[12331.24 → 12331.88] What the heck?
[12332.50 → 12332.82] Yeah.
[12332.82 → 12333.36] I don't know.
[12333.44 → 12335.56] I'm sure there's a very good reason for it.
[12335.56 → 12338.14] I don't know what's saying about that, uh, that infrastructure, but I'm sure it's something
[12338.14 → 12340.54] like what Dan said, how it's a bit of a holdover.
[12340.64 → 12341.70] I think it's called a PBX.
[12341.86 → 12342.74] Is that what it's called?
[12342.76 → 12342.88] Yeah.
[12342.88 → 12344.40] People are saying like race conditions.
[12344.96 → 12345.28] Yeah.
[12345.36 → 12347.42] There's like, I think there are lots of things that could be causing it.
[12347.76 → 12349.58] Clearly we've solved that with digital stuff.
[12349.58 → 12352.72] Like two people can attempt to call each other on discord, and it'll just connect it.
[12353.30 → 12356.78] Um, I mean, yeah, I think they're talking about like, no, I know.
[12356.88 → 12357.16] Yeah.
[12357.22 → 12357.64] I understand.
[12357.98 → 12358.24] Yeah.
[12358.24 → 12360.98] But I mean, it's pretty much all VoIP anyway.
[12361.34 → 12363.70] Like it's, it's basically just international discord.
[12363.70 → 12366.80] But with more money.
[12368.90 → 12369.34] Yeah.
[12369.42 → 12370.26] I don't know.
[12370.52 → 12370.90] Not sure.
[12372.66 → 12372.86] Yeah.
[12373.24 → 12374.04] Uh, okay.
[12374.18 → 12375.48] Let's push that button.
[12375.56 → 12376.92] Oh, I thought of a good answer for this one.
[12376.94 → 12377.58] I'm curating it.
[12377.70 → 12378.34] Okay, good.
[12379.34 → 12379.94] Is it going to push?
[12380.30 → 12380.70] I don't know.
[12381.48 → 12382.22] Hi, LLD.
[12382.58 → 12383.74] Good day from Australia.
[12384.36 → 12389.08] Due to having better margins on your backpack and screwdriver, would you be more open to
[12389.08 → 12391.38] free shipping deals once or twice a year?
[12391.72 → 12392.26] Thanks again.
[12392.26 → 12394.34] We'll have to see.
[12394.66 → 12400.22] Um, it's one of those things where, you know, obviously it all comes down to kind of figuring
[12400.22 → 12406.28] out how to balance your operational expenses and your cost of goods sold and your, uh, your
[12406.28 → 12409.10] revenues and your margins and making it all make sense business wise.
[12409.10 → 12410.34] And I don't want to care anymore.
[12410.34 → 12411.94] I don't want that to be my problem.
[12412.08 → 12418.62] I want that to be, uh, our CEO's problem and our COO of creator warehouses problem, Nick
[12418.62 → 12420.48] Light, and they'll figure it out.
[12420.62 → 12423.48] And if they decide to do something like that, then they will.
[12423.48 → 12428.86] And sometimes I might have a vision that we should do something crazy.
[12429.00 → 12433.44] I actually came up with a crazy vision quite recently that I have asked for us to try to
[12433.44 → 12434.74] find a way to do at some point.
[12435.34 → 12440.52] Um, but you know, I, I, I, I don't want to come in and make final decisions.
[12440.52 → 12443.22] That is just not, it's not the role that I have.
[12443.24 → 12444.62] And it's not the role that I want anymore.
[12444.62 → 12447.36] Hello, LLD.
[12447.64 → 12450.26] What was the coolest thing you got to sign at LTX?
[12450.94 → 12453.40] Sorry for helping lose the Halo game.
[12454.36 → 12454.54] Yeah.
[12454.70 → 12455.24] My team.
[12455.36 → 12457.50] I love my team, but they were terrible.
[12458.06 → 12459.22] They were awful.
[12459.34 → 12460.08] I love you all.
[12460.20 → 12461.14] You're awful.
[12461.74 → 12466.00] I had like, I had like the highest kill count on my team, like every time.
[12466.54 → 12469.52] And I couldn't do, I couldn't get anything done.
[12469.58 → 12469.76] Okay.
[12469.76 → 12470.88] Not every time they were actually.
[12470.88 → 12476.52] The only reason why we let one flag through was because you just would not give up.
[12476.60 → 12478.84] So we were on like game like six or something.
[12479.00 → 12481.28] And my guys were honestly just like kind of.
[12482.38 → 12484.76] They got tired from beating them to a pulp.
[12484.96 → 12485.64] Yeah, basically.
[12487.82 → 12490.54] In fairness to my team, they didn't actually score much either.
[12491.22 → 12494.08] No, it's very, very hard to score in that game mode.
[12494.40 → 12496.24] In a 8v8 on Blood Bulk.
[12496.24 → 12500.82] With, with this, there's no like, oh, you need, well, you want to return your
[12500.82 → 12503.20] flag, you need to stand on it for like a certain period of time.
[12503.42 → 12505.08] It instantly goes back.
[12505.42 → 12509.62] So if you're able to kill someone one time, you can immediately return the flag.
[12509.74 → 12510.90] It's very hard to cap.
[12510.98 → 12511.70] It's pretty tough.
[12513.06 → 12516.36] Of the various challenges and experiments you've done on the channel,
[12516.74 → 12519.02] which one stands out as your personal favourite?
[12519.02 → 12524.42] I don't know if it's, it's certainly not the best one we ever did.
[12524.64 → 12531.04] But if I had to pick a personal favourite just for the sheer mirth that I felt,
[12531.38 → 12534.44] and I think everyone involved felt when we were creating it,
[12534.70 → 12540.86] I would say it would have to be the electric shock dog collar challenge,
[12540.86 → 12543.62] which wasn't really a challenge.
[12543.62 → 12545.30] There was no objective.
[12545.80 → 12547.54] There was no point.
[12548.82 → 12551.46] I haven't heard that reference in so long.
[12551.90 → 12552.40] Wow.
[12552.62 → 12555.76] It was just me versus Luke.
[12558.58 → 12562.94] Who can press a button that inflicts pain on the other,
[12563.30 → 12566.00] knowing that the other also has the same button?
[12567.24 → 12567.96] And we just...
[12567.96 → 12568.66] Million views.
[12568.66 → 12571.92] Shocked each other because, I don't know,
[12572.32 → 12573.12] F*** you, Luke.
[12575.44 → 12577.42] And also, I guess, F*** me too,
[12577.50 → 12579.12] because you're going to do it right back.
[12581.96 → 12584.36] For those wondering, do you have it open on your laptop?
[12584.54 → 12585.24] Yeah, here.
[12585.50 → 12586.38] Yeah, for those wondering...
[12586.38 → 12586.68] Oh!
[12587.02 → 12588.10] Yeah, it's like flagged as an...
[12588.10 → 12590.08] It's just freaking stupid, but whatever.
[12590.08 → 12590.60] It's kind of stupid.
[12590.76 → 12590.98] Oh.
[12591.24 → 12591.76] Oh, wow.
[12591.82 → 12593.58] Let's watch some ads for 10 minutes.
[12593.86 → 12597.18] Hey, these guys deleted their forums recently.
[12597.38 → 12598.34] Yeah, that's pretty stupid.
[12598.34 → 12598.46] That's pretty stupid.
[12598.64 → 12598.88] Yeah.
[12599.08 → 12600.90] We were supposed to talk about that on WAN Show last week,
[12600.94 → 12602.82] but we got distracted because it was live and complicated.
[12603.24 → 12603.84] There we go.
[12609.74 → 12610.34] Yeah, so...
[12611.90 → 12612.92] Oh, wait.
[12612.96 → 12613.94] I don't remember doing this.
[12614.04 → 12615.32] Why is the mineral computer there?
[12615.38 → 12616.88] Because I was wearing...
[12616.88 → 12618.82] Because we were going to film this right after mineral oil,
[12618.96 → 12621.80] and I was actually wearing the colour in the last part of mineral oil.
[12621.86 → 12622.80] So we, like, teased it?
[12623.98 → 12624.54] All right.
[12625.24 → 12625.76] Kind of.
[12626.24 → 12626.60] Yeah.
[12628.34 → 12631.74] It's just so stupid.
[12632.30 → 12637.28] So we're both wearing, like, dog training collars that no one should ever put on a dog
[12637.28 → 12638.94] because this is not how you train a dog.
[12639.24 → 12639.44] Yeah.
[12639.54 → 12642.46] But putting it on other people with consent, I guess, is fine.
[12642.70 → 12642.90] Yeah.
[12642.90 → 12646.98] Is this fair use?
[12647.06 → 12647.56] Is this channel?
[12647.66 → 12649.46] Are we authorized to use content from this channel?
[12649.58 → 12650.02] I don't know.
[12651.96 → 12653.06] Okay, so wait for it.
[12654.66 → 12657.70] It actually hurts that much, in case you're wondering.
[12659.22 → 12659.80] But don't worry.
[12659.84 → 12660.26] I'll get them.
[12660.64 → 12661.92] Yeah, where am I going to react?
[12662.02 → 12663.58] I was pretty sure you got me pretty good.
[12665.98 → 12666.78] Am I not reacting?
[12666.78 → 12667.02] Hold on.
[12667.12 → 12669.18] Is mine not working yet or something?
[12669.62 → 12671.42] Or am I just biding my time?
[12674.52 → 12674.96] Okay.
[12675.16 → 12678.52] Man, we were not very good at making videos back then.
[12678.80 → 12679.02] No.
[12679.18 → 12680.12] Mine's off now.
[12681.50 → 12682.86] Oh, maybe we were troubleshooting.
[12683.36 → 12683.74] Okay.
[12684.16 → 12685.40] Clearly yours is working.
[12685.40 → 12687.74] Why am I the sub here?
[12689.80 → 12690.56] That's normal.
[12692.34 → 12693.36] Don't tell them that.
[12694.28 → 12695.70] I think we need to end the show.
[12696.28 → 12696.68] Probably.
[12697.78 → 12698.08] Oh!
[12698.60 → 12699.78] It looks like you got me.
[12700.32 → 12701.02] Right there.
[12702.60 → 12702.96] Ooh.
[12703.16 → 12703.40] Yeah.
[12703.70 → 12704.18] All right.
[12709.92 → 12711.76] Because you don't know exactly when it's coming.
[12711.88 → 12713.42] You don't know when they're going to press it, right?
[12713.42 → 12715.42] So it's just like...
[12718.42 → 12719.78] Anyway.
[12720.24 → 12721.06] Apparently we take it off.
[12721.14 → 12721.84] That's the end of the video.
[12722.04 → 12722.38] I don't know.
[12722.50 → 12723.68] It was actually pretty fun.
[12723.86 → 12724.06] Yeah.
[12724.16 → 12725.22] It was definitely fun.
[12725.88 → 12727.18] It was super fun.
[12727.54 → 12727.70] It was super fun.
[12727.70 → 12728.06] Ah!
[12728.80 → 12729.16] Really?
[12729.16 → 12729.68] Got him!
[12730.36 → 12730.76] All right.
[12732.50 → 12733.18] Okay.
[12733.30 → 12733.74] Where are we?
[12734.40 → 12739.06] Hey, DLL Wild, that Baldur's Gate 2 released before I was even born.
[12739.28 → 12741.02] And now it's this popular.
[12742.10 → 12743.34] Now it's this popular.
[12743.84 → 12748.06] Any games you're fond of that released before you were born or take you back?
[12749.50 → 12753.40] Tie Fighter takes me back, but that came out in like 1994 or something like that.
[12753.46 → 12755.32] Released before I was born.
[12755.44 → 12755.68] Yikes.
[12755.96 → 12756.30] Ah!
[12756.42 → 12756.62] Damn.
[12757.12 → 12760.56] I thought of one, but it was one year after I was born, so it doesn't count.
[12760.60 → 12761.34] Chip's Challenge?
[12762.24 → 12763.82] I did play Chip's Challenge.
[12764.02 → 12765.24] I don't know if it is really like...
[12765.24 → 12766.42] I don't actually know when that came out.
[12766.66 → 12768.12] No desire to play it again though.
[12768.64 → 12769.06] Oh no.
[12769.60 → 12771.32] Great games before...
[12771.32 → 12771.72] Uh...
[12771.72 → 12773.82] Uh...
[12773.82 → 12774.22] Uh...
[12774.22 → 12774.90] Uh...
[12774.90 → 12777.08] Yeah, it was 1989 for Chip's Challenge.
[12777.58 → 12777.98] Tetris.
[12778.60 → 12779.72] That's a bit of a cop out.
[12780.20 → 12780.86] Yeah, Duck Hunt.
[12781.36 → 12781.98] Duck Hunt.
[12781.98 → 12784.32] Duck Hunt came out before I was born.
[12784.48 → 12785.10] Hold on.
[12785.74 → 12788.28] When did Duck Hunt come out?
[12788.28 → 12788.84] 1984.
[12789.60 → 12790.04] 1984?
[12790.30 → 12792.14] Yeah, Duck Hunt came out before I was born.
[12792.28 → 12794.28] That's a super cool game from before I was born.
[12794.42 → 12794.84] There you go.
[12795.34 → 12795.62] Nice.
[12795.64 → 12796.00] Got it.
[12796.76 → 12797.38] Nailed it.
[12797.70 → 12797.98] Nice.
[12798.72 → 12801.84] Billionaires today by supercars and yachts.
[12801.84 → 12805.68] Will the new billionaires of the next generation have super gaming systems?
[12805.98 → 12806.94] And what would they look like?
[12806.94 → 12808.90] They already have super gaming systems.
[12809.04 → 12814.30] They have giant Samsung The Wall things to play games or watch NBA games on or whatever.
[12814.30 → 12815.58] Um...
[12815.58 → 12819.80] They probably have, like, personal, you know, VR arcade style setups.
[12819.80 → 12820.70] Yeah, I was going to say...
[12820.70 → 12821.04] Multi-user VR.
[12821.48 → 12821.72] Yeah.
[12822.02 → 12825.44] Multi-user backpack VR giant halls and stuff.
[12825.48 → 12827.36] And they don't buy supercars and yachts.
[12827.42 → 12829.56] That's like millionaire f*** it.
[12829.64 → 12830.08] Um...
[12830.08 → 12831.80] They buy news outlets.
[12832.82 → 12833.94] And they buy politicians.
[12834.56 → 12836.34] That's what billionaires are actually buying.
[12836.40 → 12837.46] They buy rocket ships.
[12837.46 → 12841.58] If they buy a yacht, they have to deconstruct a historical bridge to get it out.
[12841.80 → 12843.72] Or it doesn't really count, to be honest.
[12844.30 → 12848.66] Is it really that cool if you're not destroying history?
[12849.04 → 12849.62] I don't know.
[12851.02 → 12851.50] LLD.
[12851.82 → 12854.04] Is there an ETA on the precision screwdriver?
[12854.38 → 12856.26] Linus mentioned it a while back.
[12856.58 → 12856.74] No.
[12857.06 → 12860.78] Right now, we're still in the can we make one good one phase.
[12860.98 → 12866.10] And then after that, it goes into can we make 10,000 good ones phases.
[12866.10 → 12868.40] And that is usually much more challenging.
[12870.40 → 12871.20] That's all I got.
[12871.40 → 12873.48] What isn't challenging is ending the show.
[12873.48 → 12874.80] We will see you again next week.
[12875.02 → 12875.96] Same bad time.
[12876.32 → 12877.66] Same bad channel.
[12878.16 → 12878.58] Bye!
[12878.58 → 12878.66] Bye!
[12878.66 → 12903.12] Oh, show is brought to you by Squarespace, Back blaze, and Dev-
