[0.00 → 4.86] Just like Valve, we have decided 10 years of WAN Show is enough.
[5.06 → 6.56] It's time for WAN Show 2.
[6.66 → 9.80] It's basically just like the old WAN Show.
[10.18 → 12.22] But with better water effects.
[12.40 → 12.74] 2.
[13.32 → 14.20] Yeah, that's right.
[14.20 → 16.06] We'll be talking about the launch of...
[16.06 → 18.16] I almost called it CSGO 2.
[18.38 → 19.80] That would have been very unfortunate.
[20.30 → 26.02] Also, Samsung has been experiencing a rash of monitors cracking.
[26.78 → 28.92] Just spontaneously cracking.
[29.06 → 29.78] We'll be talking about that.
[29.78 → 30.36] What else we got?
[30.66 → 31.86] What other news is cracking?
[32.26 → 33.96] My news is the most cracking.
[35.66 → 41.54] $2 million zero-day bounty has been posted by a group in Russia.
[41.70 → 42.38] We'll talk about that.
[43.54 → 46.14] And man, I really didn't want to sit here searching for topics.
[46.38 → 47.52] But I'm doing it anyway.
[48.00 → 49.18] Because I didn't think you were going to...
[49.18 → 50.58] Usually you just take the main ones.
[50.62 → 51.96] I didn't think you were going to take CSGO.
[52.00 → 52.22] Yeah.
[53.38 → 54.44] It just screwed me up.
[54.44 → 55.60] You know what I actually do?
[55.86 → 58.14] Is I try to take whatever I think you would take.
[58.14 → 61.66] Those were the two I was going to take.
[61.86 → 64.52] So I'm going to get back at you and pick this week in AI.
[64.82 → 69.72] Because there's been a lot of amazing updates that Linus is going to be so excited to hear about.
[70.08 → 71.00] It's so good.
[71.34 → 72.40] It's so interesting.
[72.40 → 94.62] The show is brought to you today by Signal Wire, Corsair, and PDF.
[94.62 → 97.04] Why don't we jump right into our headline topic today.
[97.42 → 99.90] The launch of Counter-Strike 2.
[100.18 → 108.72] On Wednesday, Valve released Counter-Strike 2 not as a dedicated game, but as an update to CSGO.
[109.34 → 112.54] CS2 already has over a million players.
[112.64 → 115.40] I believe they've gone well past a million in concurrence.
[115.76 → 122.10] But many have criticized the move to replace CSGO rather than offer the game separately.
[122.10 → 132.14] One notable effect of replacing CSGO rather than launching as a new game is that Counter-Strike 2 has inherited all of CSGO's reviews and ratings.
[132.60 → 147.16] That means that it has an overall rating of 88% with 7.5 million reviews, despite the fact that of the 3,500 reviews from launch day, only 59% are positive.
[147.16 → 157.26] The game is free to play, but is also at the top of Steam's top sellers list, possibly indicating that Valve is already making a ton of money through loot boxes.
[157.64 → 169.20] And players have likewise criticized the game's lack of features that were present on CSGO, like left-handed mode, many popular CSGO maps, and macOS support.
[169.32 → 170.46] Have you played yet?
[170.56 → 170.92] I have.
[170.92 → 172.52] I assumed you would have.
[172.64 → 174.60] I'm going to insert some stuff before I go.
[174.72 → 175.60] I like checking this.
[175.70 → 178.02] I've brought it up on stream before.
[178.38 → 186.14] Well, can we give a high-level overview of the game first, and then can you do your whole thing that you do with Starfield and Baldur's Gate 3 and now Counter-Strike 2?
[186.30 → 187.38] Yeah, it's going to be that again.
[187.40 → 188.96] So, it's Counter-Strike, right?
[188.96 → 189.16] Yeah.
[189.16 → 194.20] We've been through, I mean, how many major iterations would you say there have been of Counter-Strike?
[194.38 → 201.52] I think if you ask the hardcore, you know, 1.something, 1.6 was obviously hugely important.
[201.88 → 202.08] Yeah.
[202.36 → 205.08] I don't think anyone really cared about Condition 0.
[205.76 → 207.58] Source was sort of a mid-release.
[207.58 → 213.08] Yeah, I think it was the 1.x, Source, Go, and now 2.
[213.62 → 215.30] I think those would be the important steps.
[215.42 → 218.40] So, Condition 0, we're going to kind of ignore.
[218.40 → 219.58] I don't think anyone cares.
[219.76 → 220.94] Did anyone care about Source?
[221.54 → 226.64] Because from what I can recall, the esports scene was all CS 1.6.
[226.66 → 228.74] A lot of it still stayed back, but people did care about Source.
[229.02 → 231.54] It wasn't Condition 0.2.
[232.10 → 233.32] People played Source for sure.
[233.74 → 234.42] Okay, fine.
[234.56 → 234.98] Fair enough.
[235.18 → 239.02] And then CSGO has obviously been by far the biggest.
[239.56 → 241.98] The biggest step after 1, I think.
[241.98 → 248.76] I think if you would take the size of gaming as it was in, you know, what would that be?
[248.82 → 253.64] The early 2000s when 1.6 was the ruler of the roost, right?
[254.90 → 264.08] Relative to the size of gaming as a market, it was probably as big or a bigger deal than CS Go was towards the end of its life.
[264.08 → 271.30] But given how much gaming as a whole has grown, I think it's hard to argue that CS Go is the biggest Counter-Strike.
[273.48 → 274.58] I think that's fair.
[274.78 → 274.96] Yeah.
[275.30 → 276.14] Yeah, I think that's fair.
[276.58 → 278.10] So, with that in mind.
[278.10 → 281.52] I would actually argue in that realm then that Go wasn't the biggest one.
[281.64 → 283.22] I'd say it was 1.6.
[283.96 → 284.28] Sure.
[284.28 → 286.52] 1.6 like dominated gaming.
[286.72 → 287.52] That's what I mean.
[287.66 → 289.14] Relative to the size of gaming.
[289.18 → 290.18] 1.6 was.
[290.30 → 291.14] I think it's 1.6 for sure.
[291.24 → 291.46] Sure.
[291.72 → 292.94] 1.6 monstrous.
[293.28 → 298.08] But in terms of just actual size, right?
[298.14 → 300.16] Not relative to how big gaming is now.
[300.56 → 304.00] I think it's pretty clear CS Go is the biggest Counter-Strike ever.
[304.16 → 306.12] So, what is Counter-Strike 2?
[306.12 → 312.82] Well, we get the Source 2 engine, which is, I mean, the first major update to, I mean, okay.
[312.82 → 320.72] It's been updated, but this is the first integer revision to Source since, man, Source launched
[320.72 → 321.98] with CS Source, did it not?
[322.96 → 323.76] I think so.
[324.38 → 325.60] Or was it Half-Life 2?
[326.64 → 328.38] What's the first game with the Source engine?
[328.56 → 330.08] Chat, you're going to have to help us out here.
[330.30 → 330.70] Yeah.
[331.78 → 332.96] Unless we beat you to it.
[333.26 → 337.70] First game with Source engine is, oh, Lord, my, Counter-Strike Source.
[337.86 → 338.30] Yes, it was.
[338.52 → 340.40] Back in 2004.
[340.40 → 346.54] Luke, it's been 19 years since the Source engine launched.
[346.54 → 347.00] Oh, god.
[347.12 → 347.88] That is amazing.
[349.28 → 350.68] So, with it comes...
[350.68 → 351.88] Chat was saying Half-Life 2.
[352.38 → 356.94] With it comes a lot of more modern features, right?
[357.00 → 361.60] Like, one of the big things that Valve talked about was way better volumetric effects, for
[361.60 → 367.74] example, but I've already seen criticism of those volumetric effects, saying that they
[367.74 → 368.74] are...
[368.74 → 373.42] They alter gameplay in a way that is not pleasing to some of the players.
[373.80 → 374.10] So...
[374.10 → 374.38] Interesting.
[374.38 → 379.26] Can you tell me about what immediately jumped out of the screen at you as better and what
[379.26 → 380.32] immediately jumped out as worse?
[380.40 → 382.08] And I'm sure chat's going to get in on this as well.
[382.56 → 386.36] This might be because I haven't played for a very long time, but the hatboxes felt different.
[386.74 → 392.08] For some reason, I felt like I had a significantly easier time than I normally do when I'm playing
[392.08 → 393.20] Counter-Strike picking heads.
[393.26 → 395.08] Well, you know they've locked in tick rate, right?
[395.82 → 396.12] Oh.
[396.20 → 397.02] So it's consistent.
[397.28 → 398.30] I wonder if it's something like that.
[398.30 → 404.14] I'm not sure what it was, but I could like to think in my head, I'm just gonna...
[404.14 → 407.70] Like, at one point in time, when I started kind of sniffing this out, I decided to only
[407.70 → 408.38] play with a eagle.
[410.12 → 412.84] Because I was like, let's see how well this goes.
[413.82 → 416.14] And I was just ripping heads off.
[416.32 → 416.62] Right.
[416.78 → 417.86] And I'm like, this isn't normal.
[417.96 → 419.86] Like, I am okay at Counter-Strike, but I've never...
[419.86 → 420.70] I'm not that great.
[420.84 → 422.50] Can I propose an alternate theory?
[422.86 → 423.04] Hmm.
[423.54 → 424.48] CS2 just launched.
[425.08 → 426.36] A bunch of people...
[426.36 → 426.38] A bunch of bad players.
[428.30 → 432.14] Who haven't played in a long time, or haven't played at all.
[432.28 → 432.64] Maybe.
[432.72 → 434.44] Are sitting there being...
[434.44 → 436.54] Flopping fish in the barrel for you.
[436.92 → 437.24] Maybe.
[437.50 → 437.78] Bow!
[437.90 → 438.40] Bow!
[438.72 → 439.44] Man, I'm good!
[439.68 → 439.88] Bow!
[439.98 → 440.12] Bow!
[440.24 → 440.42] Bow!
[441.14 → 441.70] But...
[441.70 → 443.02] Could be a little bit of that.
[443.42 → 445.22] But yeah, it was interesting.
[445.48 → 447.20] I felt like something was going on there.
[447.28 → 447.84] Maybe it was that.
[447.88 → 448.66] I don't know what it was.
[448.74 → 449.88] I didn't look into it at all.
[449.94 → 450.52] I don't care.
[450.84 → 452.04] But I noticed that right away.
[452.04 → 454.46] I personally love the smokes.
[455.92 → 458.08] I know smokes are a huge part of gameplay.
[458.08 → 461.22] I know the perfect players will know very specific.
[461.42 → 462.50] Like, stand on this pixel.
[462.64 → 463.46] Throw it that pixel.
[463.58 → 465.72] It lands on this exact spot to perfectly cover.
[465.88 → 466.36] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[466.44 → 469.54] It's always been a huge part of highly competitive gameplay.
[469.62 → 469.80] Right.
[470.70 → 472.02] But I never cared.
[472.12 → 474.22] Because I wasn't playing highly competitive.
[474.22 → 476.40] So you were just throwing a smoke grenade.
[476.62 → 476.90] Yeah.
[477.06 → 477.36] Whatever.
[477.78 → 478.02] But now...
[478.02 → 478.76] Hope for the best.
[478.76 → 480.54] Now they're like fun.
[480.80 → 482.60] And you can do weird tactics with it.
[482.66 → 485.54] Because you can throw a smoke and then throw an HE is like next to it.
[485.62 → 487.46] And it'll blow off like part of it.
[487.72 → 489.20] So you can see for a quick second.
[489.46 → 492.08] But you knew where you threw that me.
[492.52 → 493.36] High explosive, whatever.
[493.36 → 498.56] So like, you can be ready and aiming at the spot that you know is going to clear.
[499.12 → 501.26] Then it clears it, and you can take out people through the smoke.
[501.36 → 502.02] Like it's...
[502.02 → 508.26] I find the tactics of that to be more interesting than, oh, every pro has just memorized 10 billion
[508.26 → 511.20] exact perfect locations to throw things to cover areas.
[511.20 → 515.82] And it also adds some counterplay to the players that didn't throw the smokes.
[516.48 → 521.64] Because you can also throw a made and then plan to push right when it clears.
[522.38 → 523.20] And like it's just...
[523.86 → 525.24] Things like that is very interesting.
[525.50 → 525.62] Yeah.
[525.68 → 529.82] Conrad pointed out you can shoot the smoke, and it creates a little hole that you can see through briefly.
[530.18 → 530.32] Yeah.
[530.38 → 537.18] So you could have a like rifleman up front create a little zone for your opera to look through for a second
[537.18 → 538.62] and see if you can pick someone really quick.
[538.62 → 547.62] There's a lot of what I find to be very interesting play making mechanics in the new stuff that might frustrate extremely veteran players.
[547.96 → 554.86] But in my opinion will make the game more fun, more active and potentially more interesting to watch because of how dynamic it would be.
[555.14 → 557.16] So I'm interested to see how this will play out over time.
[557.24 → 557.76] Small correction.
[557.98 → 558.80] Everyone was right.
[559.74 → 560.50] I only read the headline.
[560.50 → 560.74] Is it just both?
[560.92 → 564.56] The Source engine debuted in October 2004 with Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike Source.
[564.72 → 565.42] I thought it might have been.
[565.54 → 566.26] There you go.
[566.26 → 571.22] So yeah, I mean so far it feels good to me and it feels pretty fresh.
[571.32 → 574.42] Now I didn't look into anything.
[574.54 → 577.48] I just wanted to play it for myself and see how I thought about it.
[577.60 → 579.38] It's apparently called Subtick.
[580.50 → 585.48] And some people are extremely stoked on how crisp it feels like you were.
[585.48 → 586.26] Yeah, it felt great.
[586.26 → 593.06] And the rest of the chat is a lot less stoked, and it's clearly a divisive issue.
[593.18 → 595.10] So what are the people saying?
[595.20 → 596.52] The people that aren't stoked on it?
[596.74 → 597.58] Subtick is garbage.
[598.04 → 599.44] So what's bad about it?
[599.56 → 601.42] Yeah, we want to know what's garbage.
[601.54 → 602.46] I have to confess.
[602.72 → 603.42] I haven't played.
[603.74 → 605.10] I have started Baldur's Gate 3.
[605.32 → 606.66] But I haven't played Counter-Strike 2.
[606.66 → 607.18] I'm comfortable with that too.
[607.44 → 610.72] But yeah, Conrad says Subtick feels awesome.
[611.04 → 612.02] I'm interested in...
[612.02 → 614.68] Because I can't say that I'm a Counter-Strike player.
[614.90 → 620.12] I got Global Elite but in Wingman and with Joe carrying me.
[620.20 → 620.46] Okay.
[620.60 → 621.62] So I don't know how...
[621.62 → 622.92] No offence, but like...
[622.92 → 624.16] Yeah, exactly.
[624.42 → 626.04] I don't know what that means.
[626.56 → 629.50] I could probably hit Global Elite with Joe carrying me.
[629.50 → 633.54] I'd just be like, I walk out of spawn, immediately dead.
[633.60 → 634.60] Okay, Joe, kill them.
[635.08 → 637.28] It would be great when like...
[637.28 → 639.38] So Wingman is a 2v2 game.
[639.68 → 643.24] So it would be great when Joe would die, and I would kill both of them.
[643.54 → 646.18] And he's generally a very respectful person.
[646.42 → 649.92] But you hear the undertone of surprise in his voice.
[650.38 → 652.04] And it's just like, come on, man.
[652.64 → 653.10] Oh, wow.
[653.58 → 654.26] Good job.
[654.46 → 655.46] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[655.96 → 656.24] Nice.
[658.30 → 659.08] So funny.
[659.08 → 660.40] He's a genuine guy though.
[660.46 → 662.66] Joe works customer service for Float plane.
[662.86 → 665.04] He is genuinely the nicest guy.
[665.20 → 667.06] Like I've experienced the same thing.
[667.46 → 669.48] Like there was one time playing Markov.
[669.66 → 671.46] Like you guys were knocked or something.
[671.62 → 674.26] I managed to take out a guy and then like pick you guys up.
[674.68 → 675.46] And he was just like...
[675.46 → 676.84] Not how Markov works, but yeah.
[677.04 → 677.34] Whatever.
[677.58 → 678.36] Something like that.
[678.48 → 679.40] It was kind of like that.
[679.42 → 679.86] Yeah, yeah.
[680.34 → 683.66] And he was just like, that was awesome.
[683.86 → 685.48] Like he's just genuinely happy.
[685.60 → 685.84] Yeah.
[686.38 → 687.64] But he was also very surprised.
[687.64 → 688.64] But you can...
[688.64 → 689.64] Yeah, you can hear it.
[689.68 → 690.42] You can hear it.
[690.72 → 691.98] You know what's going on.
[692.40 → 694.32] So yeah, I got carried there for sure.
[694.78 → 695.96] But like I've...
[695.96 → 698.54] What I'm saying is I've played, but we did that like years ago.
[698.72 → 699.04] Like I don't actively play.
[699.04 → 702.28] Yeah, whatever doesn't knock or whatever you're bleeding out, it doesn't matter.
[702.44 → 704.26] The point is they were incapacitated in some way.
[704.34 → 705.20] We were out of the fight.
[705.32 → 705.88] I knew what he meant.
[706.02 → 706.76] Yeah, it's fine.
[706.88 → 707.96] Just don't worry about it.
[708.00 → 708.82] We weren't playing PUBG.
[709.02 → 709.68] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[709.86 → 710.06] Okay.
[710.06 → 710.50] Jeez.
[711.50 → 711.58] Jeez.
[711.78 → 717.74] But as someone who doesn't play Counter-Strike but has played quite a bit, I have a few hundred
[717.74 → 719.54] hours on my Steam account.
[719.54 → 719.86] Me too.
[719.88 → 721.28] It's amazing how bad I am.
[724.08 → 725.14] I liked it a lot.
[725.36 → 727.84] The sub ticker, whatever it was, felt great to me.
[728.20 → 731.56] I'm sure there's people who actively play that don't like it for whatever reason.
[731.62 → 733.40] I don't know what they are, but it felt great to me.
[733.72 → 736.40] I really, really like the smokes.
[738.90 → 742.60] No one's giving a good reason to not like it so far.
[743.12 → 747.74] And Poisons in Float plane Chat says, I actually like it too, but I think people are mad that
[747.74 → 750.70] it's different, and they spent so much time to learn the old one for nothing.
[750.96 → 755.02] I have to say, that's been one of my biggest problems with Counter-Strike.
[755.12 → 757.42] It's a game that I've always wanted to love.
[757.96 → 762.56] And I, like I said, have put a significant number of hours, and probably not hundreds,
[762.56 → 770.94] but I've put a significant number of hours into, and I have never managed to really crack
[770.94 → 771.10] it.
[771.18 → 773.20] Like, I think you've played with me a couple of times.
[773.68 → 778.88] I know my way around some of the most iconic maps, and I kind of know where someone might
[778.88 → 780.44] be likely to pop their head out or whatever.
[780.54 → 790.82] But beyond that, I don't find the rote memorization of how to play this situation very interesting
[790.82 → 791.36] personally.
[791.36 → 799.82] I prefer a more dynamic, slower time to kill FPS like a Halo over something like a Counter-Strike.
[800.04 → 804.48] And I do kind of wonder if this is going to change it for me a bit.
[804.90 → 806.42] Maybe I would actually prefer this.
[806.44 → 811.44] Because one of the things that drives me most crazy, or has driven me most crazy about Counter-Strike,
[811.78 → 817.06] is I'd be sitting there at my good computer with my good internet connection, lining up someone's
[817.06 → 821.76] head and my crosshair, pulling the trigger, and it's like, nah dog.
[821.78 → 823.04] I feel like that person should be dead.
[823.10 → 829.20] When they're moving this way, and you're moving that way, you have to aim like up and to the
[829.20 → 830.10] right of their head.
[830.18 → 834.12] And then you have to draw a seven, or like an upside down seven with your mouse.
[834.12 → 837.90] And I realize that the recoil thing, Valve is never going to change that.
[837.90 → 839.40] Yeah, I was going to say, I'm pretty sure that's still a good one.
[839.40 → 841.74] That is just always going to be an element of Counter-Strike.
[841.74 → 848.56] No matter whether people like me, who feel like that's stupid, memorizing a pattern so
[848.56 → 854.54] that you can just put every single bullet down the last hole that you shot, and then everyone
[854.54 → 856.94] else, it's just scattered all over the place.
[856.96 → 858.70] That's actually not how guns work.
[858.70 → 863.30] Like, you know, you don't, you're not, you don't just like to have more strength to hold
[863.30 → 867.66] a gun steady because you, anyway, the point is, that's never going away, and that's always
[867.66 → 871.92] going to be a barrier to entry for people like me who just want to, you know, Quake style,
[872.28 → 875.96] line up the crosshair and bullet go, like, kind of where you were aiming it.
[876.74 → 881.82] But I do feel like, like you said, eliminating a little bit of that, okay, well, this is exactly
[881.82 → 884.50] the right pixel to stand on type of gameplay.
[884.50 → 888.68] I'm sure that will still happen to a certain degree at high level lobbies.
[888.70 → 891.44] And honestly, I don't think it's like a new game or anything.
[891.66 → 892.80] It's still Counter-Strike.
[893.24 → 898.12] I was, the map that I was playing on was Dust 2, just like it's been forever.
[898.22 → 903.08] There are some changes compared to like old school Dust 2, like you can't aim from T-Spawn
[903.08 → 909.02] all the way through CT doors anymore because there's that block there, but you can just jump
[909.02 → 910.98] over the thing, and then you can see it anyway.
[913.36 → 914.06] I don't know.
[914.12 → 915.70] I don't think it's a fundamentally different game.
[915.70 → 923.70] I just think of the things that they could do to make it interesting and fresh, I really
[923.70 → 925.12] like what they did with Smokes.
[925.70 → 930.02] I don't remember what version of Counter-Strike it was that had like riot shields and other
[930.02 → 931.00] like weird stuff.
[931.12 → 932.02] That was condition zero, I think.
[932.02 → 932.40] That was condition.
[932.50 → 933.32] Yeah, that sucked.
[934.34 → 935.98] So it doesn't feel like that.
[936.22 → 937.50] Tell me how you really feel, Luke.
[937.50 → 938.26] That's just dumb.
[939.38 → 940.10] Was it Go?
[940.20 → 940.80] No way.
[941.14 → 942.62] Luke hasn't played Dust 2 since that update.
[942.62 → 943.26] I have.
[944.24 → 947.08] I was just saying like it's, I don't know if Linus has.
[948.00 → 948.96] Oh, maybe I'm wrong about that.
[949.00 → 950.14] People are saying it was 1.6.
[950.78 → 952.16] 1.6 had riot shields?
[952.62 → 952.96] I don't know.
[953.04 → 954.14] Yeah, it shows you what I know.
[955.36 → 956.06] I don't know.
[956.28 → 959.20] I know I started playing pre-1.6, so maybe that's the case.
[959.20 → 963.64] It was amazing watching the two different chats, watching Float plane and Twitch chat and
[963.64 → 967.42] their different reactions to me talking about recoil management in Counter-Strike.
[967.42 → 972.48] Like Float plane's just like neutral or yeah, that kind of makes sense.
[972.88 → 974.24] Twitch chat's like get good.
[975.68 → 979.28] Memorizing shit, excuse me, memorizing shit is not being good.
[979.40 → 980.26] That's memorizing.
[980.52 → 982.24] That's not actually skill.
[982.36 → 983.18] That's memorization.
[983.42 → 986.72] I've never been a fan of the recoil pattern thing either.
[986.72 → 989.44] No, man.
[989.56 → 993.40] It's like from my point of view, recoil is supposed to be recoiled.
[993.56 → 995.52] There's supposed to be an element of randomness to it.
[995.74 → 997.98] People gamed that, right?
[998.10 → 1002.84] Like that's to me fixing that is patching a glitch.
[1003.26 → 1004.90] It's like in a high level RTS.
[1004.90 → 1011.58] If there's, you know, a particular, you know, path that you can follow with one of your characters
[1011.58 → 1017.30] that makes it travel faster from your spawn so that you can rush the enemy's spawn like
[1017.30 → 1019.26] really, really fast with a Merging or something.
[1019.92 → 1024.04] And it's by memorizing something, you can go a little bit faster.
[1024.18 → 1026.12] It's like, yeah, that should just be patched though.
[1026.16 → 1027.74] Like I don't really, I'm sorry.
[1027.84 → 1028.40] I don't agree.
[1028.40 → 1034.52] I think there's some counterplay because being able to employ the expertise of following
[1034.52 → 1038.88] that pattern while also needing to move and being under the stress of being shot and stuff
[1038.88 → 1041.82] like that is the argument for the skill.
[1042.80 → 1048.12] But then you could make a similar argument for burst fire or for, you know, squatting
[1048.12 → 1049.80] or going prone or whatever the case may be.
[1050.06 → 1055.30] Like it's just, that's the particular skill in Counter-Strike, and it's not one that I find
[1055.30 → 1055.62] appealing.
[1055.62 → 1057.58] It doesn't interest Linus, which is fair enough.
[1057.58 → 1059.02] Yeah, I'm not, I'm not just going to.
[1059.02 → 1059.64] I'm not a fan of it either.
[1059.76 → 1060.60] I understand it.
[1060.70 → 1060.84] Yeah.
[1060.90 → 1064.58] I'm not going to sit and practice something that is only applicable to one game.
[1066.98 → 1068.12] Squatting, crouching, whatever.
[1068.24 → 1069.02] They're the same thing.
[1070.36 → 1073.02] It all, it all just depends on if there's an opponent under you.
[1075.92 → 1076.32] Okay.
[1076.98 → 1082.50] What I will, what I will show is this thing that I like, the most played top 100 games
[1082.50 → 1083.42] by current players.
[1083.42 → 1088.52] Uh, so Counter-Strike is currently sitting at over 107, sorry, over 700,000 and peaked
[1088.52 → 1089.18] today.
[1089.78 → 1093.44] Today, which isn't the release date at 1.3 million.
[1094.00 → 1096.08] That is fricking wild.
[1096.30 → 1097.82] That's huge.
[1098.42 → 1099.74] That's actually crazy.
[1099.86 → 1100.82] What was the actual release date?
[1100.84 → 1102.26] It was like Tuesday or something, wasn't it?
[1102.26 → 1113.56] Um, let's just go to, I sent a screenshot to one of my buddies, uh, September 27th.
[1114.24 → 1116.46] So where's my calendar?
[1116.78 → 1117.58] It's Friday.
[1117.86 → 1118.30] Yesterday.
[1118.44 → 1119.02] So Wednesday.
[1119.02 → 1122.44] Um, I sent a screenshot to, to someone.
[1122.56 → 1125.96] I remember who, but, um, I was like, guess, guess Counter-Strike released.
[1126.10 → 1128.72] There's some achievement that you get for like opening the game.
[1130.04 → 1134.96] And I clicked on, uh, uh, Counter-Strike 2, whatever on my games list.
[1134.96 → 1137.40] And it shows like all the people that have recently gotten achievements.
[1137.40 → 1143.12] And it's just like, like everyone on my Steam list has this achievement for opening the
[1143.12 → 1143.36] game.
[1143.58 → 1144.74] I was like, wow.
[1145.02 → 1146.50] Did I just say CSGO 2?
[1146.62 → 1148.40] Man, that's going to be really annoying to get used to.
[1148.40 → 1149.10] That's amazing.
[1149.32 → 1152.96] By the way, Minor brought up a perfect point in float plane chat that validates my
[1152.96 → 1153.30] point.
[1153.50 → 1156.10] Um, predictable recoil patterns allow for macro cheating.
[1157.62 → 1158.66] Oh, yeah.
[1158.78 → 1162.46] I feel like that's pretty decently easy to detect, but yes.
[1163.88 → 1166.16] I'm sure it's been done at least at some point.
[1167.32 → 1167.72] Yeah.
[1169.10 → 1172.58] Uh, one of the one of the big points, uh, float plane chat just brought up is apparently
[1172.58 → 1176.30] CS2 made something like $40 million in its first 40 minutes.
[1176.30 → 1181.72] It's amazing how much money you can make with a free game these days.
[1181.86 → 1182.42] Isn't it?
[1183.22 → 1184.62] Oh my God.
[1185.20 → 1186.80] You freaking dummies.
[1188.90 → 1189.34] Oh.
[1191.26 → 1192.14] He said it.
[1192.26 → 1192.84] Not me.
[1193.08 → 1193.60] Not me.
[1193.68 → 1194.54] It's just so.
[1194.74 → 1195.42] It wasn't me.
[1195.54 → 1196.40] It's so annoying.
[1196.62 → 1199.42] I think, I think you're the dumb one, Linus, for not exploiting these people.
[1199.52 → 1199.80] What?
[1199.80 → 1201.40] And being evil.
[1202.12 → 1203.78] Is he, can we hear him?
[1203.84 → 1205.20] I don't know if we should hear that.
[1205.96 → 1207.00] I don't know, Dan.
[1207.12 → 1212.10] I mean, we, we've talked about doing like a, you know, Linus coin initial coin offering.
[1212.36 → 1217.52] We've, we've talked about like, like, uh, we've talked about doing a mobile game with
[1217.52 → 1219.70] like gotcha mechanics and stuff like that.
[1219.70 → 1225.18] Every, every, every time we talk about it, we're like, yeah, we could do that.
[1225.18 → 1227.76] And we could actually make way more money.
[1227.90 → 1229.40] NFTs were another example.
[1229.74 → 1234.44] There were people internally who were like, this NFT thing is huge from a business standpoint.
[1234.64 → 1235.92] We should be doing this.
[1236.00 → 1237.98] And every time we're like.
[1239.50 → 1240.32] Feels icky.
[1240.46 → 1242.18] No, we need to actually not.
[1242.72 → 1243.12] I'm not.
[1243.34 → 1243.84] It's so gross.
[1243.84 → 1248.16] I'm actually not convinced that there is any reward for taking the high road at this
[1248.16 → 1248.44] point.
[1249.12 → 1255.04] There are major streamers with major contracts, none of whose names I will mention right now,
[1255.10 → 1259.14] who make their entire living promoting gambling to children.
[1261.70 → 1263.22] And everyone's just chill with it.
[1263.40 → 1265.52] And everyone's totally cool with it.
[1265.58 → 1266.98] I don't understand.
[1267.52 → 1268.40] Yeah, it's weird to me.
[1269.12 → 1270.06] Oh, sorry.
[1270.30 → 1271.78] It's genuinely weird to me.
[1271.78 → 1275.40] Oh, we're still not going to change, guys.
[1275.96 → 1277.04] We're not going to change.
[1277.34 → 1278.12] It's just frustrating.
[1278.14 → 1280.28] It's just really frustrating.
[1280.74 → 1281.30] Yeah, I don't know.
[1281.36 → 1282.02] I had a good time.
[1282.08 → 1283.20] I'm planning on playing this weekend.
[1283.52 → 1290.46] We have the technical capabilities to do a coin or a VPN or like.
[1290.46 → 1290.84] Oh, yeah.
[1291.58 → 1296.66] God, running a VPN is a license to print money as far as I can tell.
[1296.66 → 1296.98] Oh, my God.
[1297.04 → 1301.82] What if you had a VPN that you somehow generated NFTs through?
[1304.28 → 1307.48] I mean, NFTs are kind of dead at this point, but I get it.
[1307.52 → 1307.98] I get it.
[1308.04 → 1308.48] I get it.
[1308.52 → 1309.66] I know what you mean.
[1310.12 → 1310.54] I just.
[1312.36 → 1312.72] Okay.
[1312.78 → 1313.36] So hold on.
[1313.44 → 1314.02] There was a.
[1314.10 → 1315.22] I'm dragging us back.
[1315.34 → 1316.32] I'm dragging us back.
[1316.44 → 1316.94] Do it.
[1316.94 → 1317.34] Do it.
[1318.30 → 1318.66] Do it.
[1318.66 → 1318.96] Do it.
[1318.96 → 1319.18] Do it.
[1319.30 → 1319.46] Do it.
[1320.46 → 1321.50] Oh, interesting.
[1321.70 → 1326.42] One notable effect is of replacing CSGO rather than launching a new game is that Counter
[1326.42 → 1329.46] Strike 2 has inherited all of CSGO's reviews and ratings.
[1329.78 → 1330.86] I talked about that already.
[1330.88 → 1331.18] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1331.90 → 1336.16] But to show it, it says this means there's an overall rating of 88%.
[1336.16 → 1336.48] Yeah.
[1336.54 → 1341.52] Despite the fact that 3,450 reviews solely from launch day are 59% positive.
[1341.52 → 1342.88] I did read this paragraph.
[1343.38 → 1343.84] I know.
[1345.00 → 1345.68] I know.
[1345.84 → 1346.96] He's going somewhere with this.
[1347.14 → 1347.62] That being said.
[1347.78 → 1347.92] Yes.
[1347.92 → 1351.48] The all-time, I think that may have shifted since launch day is my point.
[1351.54 → 1351.92] Oh, yeah.
[1351.96 → 1352.14] Okay.
[1352.18 → 1357.66] Because the all review, I'm not certain on this, but the all reviews say 88% positive
[1357.66 → 1360.32] and the recent review says 80% positive.
[1360.32 → 1364.64] That is 150,000 reviews within the last 30 days, which is.
[1365.08 → 1366.88] That is absolutely wild.
[1367.76 → 1369.70] I don't know how they figured out.
[1370.80 → 1371.94] I don't know how they figured out.
[1372.00 → 1374.84] Like these are the things that came in just on launch day, you know.
[1374.84 → 1379.68] Valve knows how to game their own review system.
[1379.78 → 1380.26] LMAO.
[1380.38 → 1380.52] Yeah.
[1380.62 → 1381.00] Love it.
[1382.74 → 1383.18] Hilarious.
[1383.52 → 1384.28] Specific date range.
[1386.46 → 1386.94] CaseyerJ1.
[1387.18 → 1389.20] Yes, we know about deeper networks.
[1390.08 → 1393.18] We actually have some of their hardware in office.
[1393.18 → 1394.70] I wanted to cover it.
[1394.70 → 1405.08] And my concern in covering it is that we just don't know enough about exactly how it works
[1405.08 → 1408.26] today and more importantly in the future.
[1408.26 → 1413.54] And I don't think that any review that we could complete in a reasonable amount of time
[1413.54 → 1419.32] would shed enough light on any of that.
[1419.32 → 1421.82] So we ultimately made the decision not to cover it.
[1421.86 → 1426.20] It's possible what they're doing is, you know, great and makes a ton of sense.
[1426.48 → 1430.28] But we are not planning to cover it at this time.
[1431.04 → 1431.44] Okay.
[1431.64 → 1431.88] Sorry.
[1432.02 → 1433.30] I'm going to bring us back for a sec.
[1433.40 → 1434.20] I'm going to show my screen.
[1434.22 → 1434.56] Please do.
[1434.56 → 1440.30] I was able to open this tool, which actually has a lot of features, which I didn't realize
[1440.30 → 1443.12] how in-depth the review feature was on Steam.
[1443.12 → 1447.44] But this right here, September 27th, that's the launch day.
[1447.56 → 1448.18] I'm pretty sure.
[1449.32 → 1450.00] Oh, wow.
[1450.16 → 1451.72] I didn't actually mean to highlight that.
[1451.82 → 1454.54] I didn't realize you could be like, I want to see all the reviews from just these days
[1454.54 → 1455.62] and it would load them down here.
[1455.70 → 1456.30] That's pretty cool.
[1456.62 → 1457.78] That is so cool.
[1458.26 → 1460.54] So I'm going to do that, actually.
[1461.28 → 1466.98] And if I grab just these, showing 14,000 reviews that match filters above mixed.
[1466.98 → 1472.50] Just 69% of the 14,146 user reviews are positive.
[1473.24 → 1475.64] So recent is clearly longer than three days.
[1475.84 → 1476.88] And it got 30.
[1477.00 → 1477.70] It's 30 days.
[1477.88 → 1478.44] Yeah, there you go.
[1478.54 → 1478.92] Recent is 30 days.
[1479.36 → 1484.02] And it seems to have mostly gotten hammered actually the day after release on the 28th.
[1484.14 → 1486.02] When people actually got a chance to play it.
[1486.14 → 1486.32] Yeah.
[1486.48 → 1486.96] Interesting.
[1487.38 → 1490.60] There was 11,500 and then 11,600 positive reviews.
[1490.60 → 1491.60] Or when they started brigadier.
[1491.82 → 1492.12] Back to back.
[1492.40 → 1493.72] I feel like it might be that.
[1493.72 → 1498.08] But the first day, because the first day had 11,500 positive reviews.
[1498.26 → 1500.42] And then it only had 2,000 negative.
[1500.56 → 1502.08] But the second day it got hammered.
[1502.30 → 1506.16] And then the third day it's kind of equal distribution to the second day.
[1506.32 → 1509.22] Just as many negatives as percentage wise.
[1509.70 → 1511.48] Because there isn't as many positives either.
[1512.00 → 1517.60] I do want to say though that one criticism of CS2 that I agree with is that it is...
[1518.72 → 1520.54] You know what?
[1520.56 → 1521.08] I'm going to say it.
[1521.08 → 1524.64] It is inexcusable that they simply overwrote CSGO.
[1524.82 → 1526.60] And I can totally understand why they did it.
[1526.70 → 1527.88] And it was totally for the money.
[1528.94 → 1533.72] If people could have continued to play CSGO in exactly the same way that it was left.
[1533.90 → 1535.20] With the meta the same.
[1535.38 → 1538.14] With all the items that existed the same.
[1538.26 → 1540.18] And all the new development happened in CS2.
[1540.88 → 1544.64] It would be way slower for people to take on the new one.
[1544.82 → 1547.20] And they wouldn't sell as much crap.
[1547.20 → 1552.66] And I think that really is what this decision boils down to.
[1552.94 → 1557.10] It boils down to that they don't want people playing CSGO.
[1557.22 → 1561.44] And they will go as far as to forcibly rip it out of gamers hands.
[1561.44 → 1563.82] So that they must play CS2.
[1563.82 → 1571.32] I think the thing that's getting me is I'm looking at a lot of these negative reviews.
[1572.54 → 1574.20] And none of them mean anything.
[1575.72 → 1576.52] Negative review.
[1576.62 → 1577.52] This ain't it chief.
[1578.70 → 1579.50] Negative review.
[1580.00 → 1581.88] I can't recommend this game.
[1582.84 → 1584.02] I really can't.
[1584.02 → 1584.30] Hold on.
[1584.34 → 1584.56] Hold on.
[1584.62 → 1585.86] They can still play CSGO.
[1585.98 → 1586.94] I believe it's a beta.
[1587.10 → 1588.56] It's like a beta drop down or whatever.
[1588.56 → 1588.86] Right?
[1589.44 → 1591.32] So there's a review from...
[1591.32 → 1592.60] Oh, I didn't actually know that.
[1592.66 → 1593.42] That makes sense though.
[1593.62 → 1593.82] Yeah.
[1593.86 → 1597.64] It's kind of like what Beat Games does with Beat Safer.
[1597.74 → 1599.38] You can play old versions that are movable.
[1599.82 → 1603.82] Can you guys double check exactly how that happens?
[1604.96 → 1608.40] But that is for all intents and purposes.
[1608.58 → 1610.24] Other than a small hardcore community.
[1611.40 → 1612.78] Saying, nope, forget it.
[1613.90 → 1615.76] There's a review from today.
[1616.00 → 1618.72] From a person who played for four hours total.
[1618.86 → 1622.06] Who said the last time they played was November 12th, 2019.
[1622.92 → 1626.48] And they say, I really can recommend this game to not be recommended.
[1627.80 → 1631.08] There's another negative review that just says CS2 bad, CS3 win.
[1631.32 → 1633.40] There's another negative review that just says horrible game.
[1633.74 → 1634.78] So a lot of brigadier.
[1634.98 → 1635.32] Yes.
[1635.90 → 1636.28] Hold on.
[1636.42 → 1639.28] Alan on float plane chat has a perfect point.
[1639.66 → 1641.66] That could be said for any major update.
[1641.88 → 1644.08] You're ripping the previous version out of people's hands.
[1644.08 → 1650.44] And I forget whether this was in relation to CS2 or whether it was just an unrelated article.
[1650.56 → 1654.24] But I read a perfect argument about that recently that did pretty much amount to that.
[1654.34 → 1654.52] Yeah.
[1655.40 → 1657.62] Steam, on the one hand, is amazing.
[1657.78 → 1662.26] It did for gaming what Netflix did for TV shows.
[1662.26 → 1665.54] It made it so that people are actually willing to pay for games.
[1665.88 → 1668.60] Which helps developers make money.
[1668.72 → 1670.86] Which helps the gaming industry be vibrant and grow.
[1671.06 → 1674.88] Overall, Steam is a positive thing.
[1675.48 → 1679.52] It's DRM, but in a way that is mostly palatable.
[1679.52 → 1686.96] But one of the things that it does that is both good and bad is force your games to be updated all the time.
[1687.28 → 1693.04] There are a lot of reasons why I might want to play an older version of a game.
[1693.14 → 1697.80] Whether it's that the older version is less buggy.
[1697.92 → 1700.54] Or whether it's that the older version is more buggy.
[1700.90 → 1706.70] Maybe there's a particular speed run that I want to attempt or something like that.
[1706.70 → 1708.74] And that's been patched out of the game or whatever else.
[1709.52 → 1715.26] This whole games as a service where they just slowly evolve.
[1715.44 → 1717.70] I mean, okay, Fortnite's a perfect example of this.
[1718.04 → 1720.78] What is Fortnite?
[1721.30 → 1723.48] At some point, wasn't it like a single player game?
[1725.04 → 1727.38] Yeah, it was like a zombie defence.
[1727.56 → 1729.60] And then there's like these in-game...
[1729.60 → 1732.26] I think it was a four-player co-op zombie defence tower game.
[1732.26 → 1736.96] And then there's these in-game concerts and virtual events.
[1736.96 → 1742.06] And, you know, didn't they have one season where they outright removed building or something like that?
[1742.14 → 1742.84] I can't remember.
[1743.22 → 1744.16] I don't even know.
[1744.44 → 1744.78] For a period of time.
[1744.82 → 1750.16] Yeah, as someone who's not constantly playing it, I don't even know all the permutations of Fortnite.
[1750.16 → 1759.12] But what it is clearly, to me, is a way to keep you absolutely hooked all the time so that you don't fall behind the meta.
[1759.12 → 1761.12] And I...
[1761.12 → 1770.62] As someone with kids and who runs business and who just kind of has other things going on, I mean, I think that's a...
[1770.62 → 1774.42] If I had to guess, I'd say that's a significant part of the perception that Fortnite's for kids.
[1774.48 → 1777.08] Because who other than kids has time to keep up with that stuff?
[1777.38 → 1778.18] Some people do.
[1778.86 → 1781.04] Some people are really, really into gaming.
[1781.10 → 1782.30] And that's totally cool.
[1782.38 → 1782.94] That's your thing.
[1782.94 → 1785.50] I happen to be really into some other things.
[1785.60 → 1787.62] And for me, gaming is something that I jump into.
[1789.40 → 1792.82] Oh, apparently there's build and no build game modes now.
[1793.54 → 1794.04] That's cool.
[1794.26 → 1795.54] I would prefer the no build.
[1795.98 → 1803.52] I was actually very interested in Fortnite and had linked it to a bunch of my friends and was following its development before it became a Battle Royale.
[1803.66 → 1806.30] And then when it became a Battle Royale, I was like, oh, I don't care anymore.
[1806.30 → 1808.38] But I was interested in this.
[1808.52 → 1812.02] Like, hey, there's a co-op, like, tower building, base building, defence game.
[1812.10 → 1812.72] That sounds cool.
[1813.20 → 1815.84] I found a review that I think is pretty good.
[1816.20 → 1816.50] Okay.
[1816.66 → 1817.52] From King Muffin.
[1817.64 → 1818.06] Luke Lapp.
[1818.14 → 1818.52] Here we go.
[1819.38 → 1820.78] What was the point of releasing this?
[1820.82 → 1824.38] A large amount of features and modes that were in CSGO are just gone.
[1824.54 → 1827.02] War games and most of its associated maps are removed.
[1827.34 → 1829.46] All the local T's and CTs are missing.
[1829.80 → 1832.88] Even the ones they remade for Dust 2 and Nuke a while back.
[1832.88 → 1837.24] Danger Zone, the mode they added before they went free to play, is also just gone.
[1837.64 → 1839.58] The loadout system is odd and a bit pointless.
[1839.96 → 1843.96] Why would I ever use a PP Bison or a sawed off over any other SMG or shotgun?
[1844.40 → 1850.72] It just made these guns you would buy on a whim utterly useless since they now take a slot where an objectively better gun could have been.
[1851.10 → 1853.82] The M249 has now become even more redundant.
[1854.08 → 1858.60] Also, any previously downloaded matches are gone, so now you can no longer watch them.
[1859.04 → 1862.22] Isn't the game supposed to be a sequel slash update to CSGO?
[1862.22 → 1865.54] Why are there zero new maps or weapons?
[1866.04 → 1876.26] I'm sure in time they'll add back some of the missing things I complained about since the baggage is literally featured in a screenshot on the store page, but for now it's seriously lacking.
[1876.56 → 1881.26] And that I think hits the points better than most of these other comments.
[1881.84 → 1886.70] It's like when I'm looking at the game personally, I don't really play, so I'm not noticing these things that are missing.
[1887.06 → 1890.42] The only thing I'm noticing as a cool update is smoke.
[1890.42 → 1894.20] Other than that, it's just Counter-Strike.
[1894.20 → 1899.44] Some people are taking issue with some of the points from that negative review.
[1899.94 → 1906.42] You can apparently play back your, it says demos, but I think what you mean is like previous matches.
[1906.70 → 1906.90] Yeah.
[1907.44 → 1908.38] With the beta.
[1909.12 → 1911.52] I'm like, yeah, but that's...
[1911.52 → 1912.74] You shouldn't have to do that.
[1912.74 → 1915.16] Kind of hassle.
[1915.52 → 1929.06] Like, I think that a lot of the time our audience might forget or not realize that for an average user, anything beyond the big green button that says play doesn't exist.
[1929.98 → 1932.56] People won't Google it.
[1932.56 → 1935.00] They won't even think to Google it.
[1935.64 → 1937.34] CSGO is just CS2.
[1937.42 → 1938.26] Now, do I have all my skins?
[1938.40 → 1938.98] Oh, thank God.
[1939.10 → 1939.36] Okay.
[1940.00 → 1941.88] I am playing my game now.
[1943.40 → 1947.56] And so I can see it being frustrating for people, but...
[1948.42 → 1953.56] Chris K in Float plane Chat said CS2 overriding CSGO is to port over CSGO bands.
[1953.56 → 1961.18] They had to do this because banned accounts items get locked and unsellable and untradeable for good, and the items all get ported over to CS2.
[1961.70 → 1962.56] That's a...
[1963.56 → 1967.02] If that's what they've officially said, that's a bad excuse.
[1968.60 → 1970.48] There are definitely ways to solve that.
[1970.80 → 1982.92] Can we just be thankful that even if Valve, who, you know, still have their reputation as good guys, in spite of the fact that they definitely microtransaction the crap out of things,
[1983.56 → 1987.56] is not the only one succeeding right now?
[1988.50 → 1989.28] Larian Studios.
[1989.62 → 1990.00] Dude.
[1990.84 → 1993.06] Giant middle finger to microtransactions.
[1993.26 → 1993.40] Dude.
[1993.62 → 1994.96] There are no microtransactions.
[1995.06 → 1995.28] None.
[1995.68 → 1997.36] And, like, it was...
[1997.36 → 1998.30] I exchanged...
[1998.30 → 2005.34] I had a very, very brief exchange with someone on their team, and basically what it amounted to was that...
[2005.34 → 2005.70] He's cool.
[2005.78 → 2009.34] ...they took a big risk doing a game the old way.
[2009.60 → 2009.82] Yeah.
[2009.82 → 2024.90] And it's been very validating seeing gamers react to that and shovel, like, trucks of money at them for actually giving a shit and doing it properly.
[2025.10 → 2026.48] And I showed this earlier.
[2026.54 → 2027.48] I'm going to jump back over.
[2027.60 → 2029.70] This is the developer of Baldur's Gate 3, guys.
[2030.02 → 2030.76] Larian Studios.
[2031.10 → 2031.30] Yeah.
[2032.04 → 2033.22] They're selling a few.
[2033.84 → 2035.16] They're selling a handful here.
[2035.16 → 2035.40] Yeah.
[2035.46 → 2036.94] I mean, how long has it been out now?
[2037.04 → 2037.72] Probably two months?
[2038.08 → 2039.44] Yeah, it's been a couple of months now.
[2040.32 → 2041.06] On Steam.
[2041.18 → 2042.94] Counter-Strike 2, Data 2, Baldur's Gate 3.
[2043.06 → 2044.60] People are playing the crap out of it.
[2044.62 → 2048.92] Cyberpunk has gotten crazy coverage recently for doing great things.
[2049.02 → 2050.54] Releasing this 2.0 update.
[2050.62 → 2052.18] People are jazzed on the new updates.
[2052.18 → 2052.46] It's supposed to be amazing.
[2052.80 → 2055.14] It's apparently stunningly great.
[2055.62 → 2059.24] Baldur's Gate is still beating it, both in current players right now and also Peak Today.
[2059.24 → 2063.38] And I would also point out that the current players in Peak Today are very similarly high.
[2063.38 → 2064.68] Oh, yeah.
[2064.76 → 2069.86] So people are just turning on Baldur's Gate 3 and then just eating at their computer.
[2070.08 → 2070.32] Yeah.
[2070.76 → 2074.44] And running quickly to go pee-pee and getting back to their computer.
[2074.44 → 2081.14] And I know a lot of people that are running like second, third, full campaigns at this point.
[2081.28 → 2087.78] Whether with a different mix of people or even just by themselves and just doing different actions or playing with different characters in their party.
[2087.78 → 2088.80] I love that it's co-op friendly.
[2089.26 → 2090.38] It's super co-op friendly.
[2090.38 → 2091.26] I started it with the wife.
[2091.50 → 2091.72] Yeah.
[2092.08 → 2092.34] Yeah.
[2092.64 → 2093.54] It's been a challenge.
[2093.80 → 2094.06] Yeah.
[2095.14 → 2096.56] I have some counterpoints.
[2096.70 → 2098.58] I didn't want to actually talk about it because I wanted to talk about it away.
[2098.58 → 2099.44] I noticed that.
[2099.66 → 2101.72] You're like, how's Baldur's Gate 3?
[2102.14 → 2102.44] Hold on.
[2102.50 → 2104.76] This is actually worth looking at.
[2105.82 → 2107.46] Luke and I are chatting on Discord.
[2108.68 → 2110.10] I mean, I'm going to pull this up.
[2110.22 → 2113.48] You're just going to have to deal with this, okay?
[2113.90 → 2114.50] Here we go.
[2115.20 → 2116.32] This is amazing.
[2116.32 → 2118.06] Okay, so here's my phone.
[2118.54 → 2121.00] Okay, this is thoughts on BG3.
[2121.60 → 2124.00] Here's a wall of text I sent back to him.
[2124.20 → 2125.12] Thoughtfully crafted.
[2125.44 → 2126.82] I thought we were having a conversation.
[2126.84 → 2128.20] I don't think you should show the next line.
[2128.24 → 2133.00] His next message goes unrelated to your above post, some other stuff.
[2133.10 → 2133.54] There you go.
[2133.64 → 2133.80] Yeah.
[2134.00 → 2134.84] Yeah, some other stuff.
[2135.56 → 2136.90] Are you f***ING kidding me?
[2137.96 → 2140.20] Okay, what you said was too interesting.
[2140.50 → 2143.02] So I was like, I can't talk about this.
[2143.10 → 2143.98] We have to wait until when.
[2144.28 → 2145.68] No, a good employee.
[2145.68 → 2147.20] I think you should put it at.
[2147.42 → 2148.76] Because it's good for when.
[2148.92 → 2149.90] Because you had a lot of thought.
[2149.90 → 2152.04] I thought you were going to be like, it's good.
[2152.90 → 2154.76] I didn't think you were going to write a novel.
[2155.02 → 2156.20] So I think we should talk about it.
[2156.20 → 2159.38] He goes, unrelated to your above post, something he said.
[2159.64 → 2163.36] And I'm like, but you mean that, but not in Baldur's Gate 3?
[2163.36 → 2166.48] And he's like, I mean, that's also true in Baldur's Gate 3 sometimes.
[2166.48 → 2167.90] I go, any context?
[2168.12 → 2171.82] And he's just like, a different convo that was going on.
[2171.84 → 2173.84] I'm like, the f*** are you talking about?
[2174.46 → 2175.08] Okay, fine.
[2175.34 → 2176.62] What do you want to talk about then?
[2176.70 → 2177.72] Why don't I read out what I said?
[2177.72 → 2178.66] Pretty much the whole thing, yeah.
[2178.66 → 2178.90] Okay.
[2179.56 → 2180.52] Definitely some-
[2180.52 → 2181.02] Let's go point by point.
[2181.08 → 2183.18] Definitely some quality of life things are annoying.
[2183.48 → 2185.04] The camera controls are driving me nuts.
[2185.04 → 2186.70] Okay, so I completely agree.
[2187.26 → 2193.42] The camera controls were, I think, if I had to take a complete guess, I think they were
[2193.42 → 2196.56] just taken directly out of Divinity Original Sin 2.
[2196.88 → 2197.44] Well, they suck.
[2197.54 → 2198.60] They have the same kind of problems.
[2198.74 → 2202.34] I don't know how far you are in, but there's this gate that you go through at some point.
[2202.48 → 2203.44] I'm not going to be too specific.
[2203.58 → 2203.76] Sure.
[2203.88 → 2204.56] But like-
[2204.56 → 2205.48] Balder's by any chance?
[2205.58 → 2206.14] No, actually.
[2206.22 → 2207.32] I'm talking about one before that.
[2207.62 → 2210.70] Wait, do you just mean like in the tutorial mission, like very early?
[2211.30 → 2213.98] Because you definitely go through a gate, like very early on.
[2214.12 → 2215.82] There's one particular one I'm talking about.
[2215.86 → 2219.16] I don't want to get into it, but getting through it is so annoying.
[2219.22 → 2219.64] It was annoying.
[2219.74 → 2222.74] It was hard to click on it because you just click on the arch above it, and you're trying
[2222.74 → 2223.92] to click on the ground past it.
[2223.98 → 2224.10] Yeah.
[2224.44 → 2226.56] So that, I mean, that's like, well, okay.
[2226.76 → 2231.66] For us, it's about two hours in, but I think it's probably about 20 minutes in for people
[2231.66 → 2233.54] who are not playing with Yvonne.
[2233.76 → 2238.64] It really depends.
[2238.76 → 2242.02] You could go a route that gets you there pretty late, but I think we're talking about the
[2242.02 → 2244.34] same gate, but it's like pretty annoying to get through.
[2244.44 → 2247.96] So yeah, I think the camera controls could be a bit better, but-
[2247.96 → 2249.16] Honestly though, I-
[2249.16 → 2249.46] They're fine.
[2249.82 → 2253.88] I hate the camera controls in pretty much any top-down game that isn't Supreme Commander.
[2254.14 → 2254.24] Yeah.
[2254.24 → 2254.30] Yeah.
[2254.30 → 2261.82] Once you use what they call a strategic zoom is what they called the camera controls in
[2261.82 → 2262.50] Supreme Commander.
[2262.50 → 2269.76] Once you use anything else, once you use that, everything else seems just designed to frustrate
[2269.76 → 2270.00] you.
[2270.38 → 2270.66] Yeah.
[2270.66 → 2271.64] It's amazing.
[2271.88 → 2278.16] With the scroll wheel, you can go in pretty much an instant all the way out so that your
[2278.16 → 2287.56] entire screen is the entire area map with fog of war or unexplored areas covered as applicable.
[2287.56 → 2297.30] And then every playable anything or every character, every unit is represented by an icon that just
[2297.30 → 2300.76] shows you what kind of unit it is and what tier level it is.
[2301.06 → 2302.46] And then you can go from there.
[2302.68 → 2303.88] You can just flick your wheel.
[2303.88 → 2308.50] So wherever your mouse is, you flick your wheel, and it goes, you can go all the way down to just
[2308.50 → 2315.10] that one individual unit and absolutely everywhere in between with pretty much infinite granularity,
[2315.20 → 2321.92] not infinite, but definitely enough granularity that you can do and see anything you'd want to see.
[2322.02 → 2328.02] You can also grab the camera and adjust it down if you want to just watch a battle take place or
[2328.02 → 2328.74] whatever it is.
[2328.84 → 2331.84] It is a spectacular-
[2331.84 → 2332.72] It's perfect.
[2332.80 → 2333.18] ...camera.
[2333.18 → 2333.24] ...camera.
[2333.74 → 2341.42] And so for something like Baldur's Gate 3, I am constantly like, what if I wanted to see more
[2341.42 → 2345.08] than a dozen steps in front of my character right now?
[2345.76 → 2346.80] But what if I didn't want to-
[2346.80 → 2347.72] I really wish I could zoom out.
[2348.22 → 2348.46] Yeah.
[2348.78 → 2350.22] I wish I could zoom out.
[2350.32 → 2354.00] And even if they're like, part of the tactical nature of the game is that you can't see that
[2354.00 → 2356.34] far or whatever, just fog of war it or something.
[2356.44 → 2356.60] Yeah.
[2356.76 → 2358.24] But let me zoom out.
[2358.24 → 2358.64] Yeah.
[2358.64 → 2365.84] Especially because a lot of the time there is no fog of war excuse for it because I have a character over there.
[2365.88 → 2368.40] I just don't happen to have that one selected right now.
[2369.04 → 2370.80] So, no, I don't actually know.
[2370.88 → 2371.78] I don't buy that at all.
[2371.92 → 2372.48] Like, Anna.
[2372.76 → 2377.50] Anna 1800 didn't have a far enough zoom out at launch.
[2377.50 → 2382.84] And the reason for it was just that it was a really demanding game, and they had performance concerns.
[2383.36 → 2388.48] So, because that team has done an amazing job with that game, by the way.
[2388.48 → 2388.78] Oh, yeah.
[2388.78 → 2390.34] They've built so much content for it.
[2390.68 → 2391.24] Huge labour.
[2391.40 → 2393.74] Expansion packs, but not like-
[2393.74 → 2396.34] The tactical view, I don't think is exactly what he's asking for.
[2396.98 → 2398.22] Microtransaction sort of crap.
[2398.22 → 2405.66] And so, basically, they listened to their players, and they built an extended zoom out.
[2405.96 → 2408.94] And they're just like, when you click it, it just says, hey, this may have a performance impact.
[2409.30 → 2409.52] Boom.
[2409.72 → 2410.42] Problem solved.
[2410.50 → 2415.86] You can see so much more of the map, and you can comfortably tactically manipulate things.
[2417.42 → 2417.82] Yeah.
[2417.94 → 2419.28] I find it very frustrating.
[2419.30 → 2420.80] So, do you know about the tactical view?
[2421.84 → 2422.20] No.
[2422.34 → 2423.40] I haven't used the tactical view.
[2423.52 → 2423.76] Okay.
[2423.96 → 2425.40] So, that can help.
[2425.40 → 2429.84] I still don't like it for things like getting through the gate that we were talking about.
[2430.02 → 2430.10] Sure.
[2430.54 → 2432.72] But it definitely can help, for sure.
[2432.92 → 2440.88] It gives you like a more combat styled top-down vertical view that has more of a-
[2440.88 → 2440.94] Yeah.
[2440.94 → 2441.84] That's still not far enough.
[2442.04 → 2442.24] Yeah.
[2442.64 → 2443.26] Not even close.
[2443.42 → 2443.56] Yeah.
[2443.68 → 2444.20] That's what I was saying.
[2444.22 → 2445.68] It can help, but it doesn't solve it.
[2445.68 → 2449.36] I need to be able to see to-
[2449.36 → 2450.02] Oh, that is BG3.
[2450.02 → 2451.06] I thought that was Divinity First.
[2451.12 → 2451.50] Here.
[2452.62 → 2453.66] At least.
[2453.66 → 2455.74] Like, right now, that's-
[2455.74 → 2458.58] This is one movement and change.
[2458.78 → 2459.04] Mm-hmm.
[2459.16 → 2460.00] That's nothing.
[2460.66 → 2461.02] Yeah.
[2461.10 → 2462.16] I wish I could see a little bit more.
[2462.42 → 2462.62] Yeah.
[2462.82 → 2463.18] Definitely.
[2464.18 → 2464.56] Okay.
[2464.68 → 2465.08] Keep going.
[2465.98 → 2466.38] All right.
[2469.04 → 2471.50] I want to invert the middle mouse button camera drag.
[2471.58 → 2472.72] Didn't see an option for that.
[2472.80 → 2473.80] Need to look into it more.
[2474.06 → 2474.80] Is there a way to do that?
[2474.80 → 2474.96] Oh, yeah.
[2475.52 → 2475.76] I don't know.
[2475.76 → 2477.08] It's driving me absolutely crazy.
[2477.22 → 2480.62] So, hold middle mouse to move the camera around, and I want it the other way.
[2481.22 → 2482.56] I wouldn't be surprised.
[2482.56 → 2483.70] Maybe I'm-
[2483.70 → 2485.14] There's probably a mod or something.
[2485.14 → 2486.80] I was going to say, I just looked it up.
[2486.88 → 2490.32] There are currently 2,200 mods for Baldur's Gate 3 on Nexus.
[2490.32 → 2490.42] Yeah.
[2490.50 → 2492.52] So, like I said, I hadn't looked into it at all.
[2492.54 → 2494.82] I bet you there's a camera zoom one.
[2495.06 → 2495.92] I wouldn't be surprised.
[2496.04 → 2500.12] I said it was couples gaming night, so I didn't want to tinker with dumb stuff like that.
[2500.12 → 2504.54] Otherwise, I would spend all couples gaming night tinkering with the interface of my game
[2504.54 → 2507.20] and us doing absolutely no gaming together.
[2507.54 → 2509.46] Yeah, Jean-Luc, he wants to invert that.
[2509.54 → 2510.74] He knows that that's how that works.
[2511.00 → 2511.78] He wants to invert it.
[2511.84 → 2511.96] Yeah.
[2512.04 → 2514.68] I want to invert the horizontal, the x-axis movement.
[2515.60 → 2517.28] Lack of a tutorial is kind of stupid.
[2517.38 → 2517.78] IMO.
[2518.00 → 2520.48] Apparently, they have addressed this, and it increases play time, but...
[2521.94 → 2522.62] Okay.
[2522.68 → 2523.98] I didn't know they had addressed this.
[2523.98 → 2525.56] I was going to say, I actually...
[2525.56 → 2533.40] The tutorial thing is always really funky because I feel this way with Starfield and BG3,
[2533.40 → 2539.20] but there was an era, I'm going to guess, but I have no idea, five years ago,
[2539.32 → 2544.54] where everyone was raging at games for having this way too ridiculous tutorials.
[2545.36 → 2549.88] I find in a lot of shooter games, having any tutorial just annoys me.
[2550.34 → 2551.02] Yeah, that's fair.
[2551.02 → 2554.26] Obviously, control or see crouches.
[2554.54 → 2556.12] Obviously, fire is left click.
[2556.84 → 2558.58] Obviously, I do all these various things.
[2558.76 → 2559.10] Counterpoint.
[2560.26 → 2561.48] Not obvious to everyone.
[2561.48 → 2565.34] I've played Dragon Age Origins and that's it.
[2565.84 → 2571.22] Anytime I've tried to do a more hardcore Dungeons and Dragons game, whether it's MOTOR or whether
[2571.22 → 2572.00] it was Never witch Nights 2...
[2572.00 → 2574.42] So what was confusing to you about the Dungeons and Dragons portion?
[2574.70 → 2575.10] Because...
[2575.10 → 2575.42] Well, no, no.
[2575.44 → 2575.70] Hold on.
[2575.74 → 2575.98] Hold on.
[2576.04 → 2577.02] I'm not done yet, though.
[2577.20 → 2577.40] Okay.
[2577.54 → 2582.84] So I've played Dragon Age Origins, but I have never made it into a hardcore D&D game.
[2583.96 → 2584.08] Yeah.
[2584.08 → 2589.62] So there's a ton of stuff that wasn't intuitive to me and I just didn't know.
[2589.74 → 2590.28] Like what though?
[2590.28 → 2597.66] So, for example, I wasn't sure what the orange bar on the right side next to all your characters is.
[2597.72 → 2599.68] It's how much movement you have remaining on your turn.
[2599.68 → 2600.96] But I just had to infer that.
[2601.80 → 2618.30] And that was annoying because I was spending a bunch of my time figuring out stuff for myself while also answering questions for someone who, unlike me, has never touched a role-playing game at all.
[2618.30 → 2624.40] And so if one of the features of this game is co-op, I think that there's an expectation.
[2624.54 → 2625.36] Look at It Takes Two.
[2625.84 → 2629.72] That game was clearly, intentionally f***ING easy.
[2630.26 → 2632.38] Like it was beautiful.
[2633.52 → 2645.12] I have criticisms of it, but it was beautiful, and it managed frequent gameplay shifts that kept you engaged, but it was really easy.
[2645.22 → 2647.08] Basically impossible to fail.
[2648.30 → 2655.34] And the reason for that is because it was clearly designed for the gamer and their SO.
[2655.80 → 2657.70] Same with Haven, for example.
[2657.98 → 2661.54] Another, yeah, you can play this as a couple type game.
[2661.64 → 2670.84] So if co-op is a major feature here, then I do think they have to consider that not everyone is a gamer and not everyone has played Dungeons & Dragons.
[2670.84 → 2674.50] Like for Yvonne, I'm just trying to think.
[2674.76 → 2680.18] It's been a few days now, but I'm just trying to think of some of the other things that she found kind of confusing.
[2680.18 → 2686.58] One thing I would defend with that is they didn't think it would be anywhere near as successful as it was.
[2686.68 → 2687.00] That's fair.
[2687.06 → 2693.78] So they probably thought the target audience and the vast majority amount of people that were going to play this were both gamers.
[2693.78 → 2701.10] And probably in a lot of cases, because I know a lot of Marian fans are D&D or other various tabletop RPG players.
[2701.10 → 2706.34] And something I was going to ask you earlier is how much Divinity Original Sin 2 did we play?
[2706.44 → 2707.24] I don't think it was much.
[2707.34 → 2707.62] Not much.
[2707.68 → 2708.82] We played the tutorial.
[2709.22 → 2711.98] It has the same type of movement style mechanics.
[2712.08 → 2714.74] We have a certain amount of distance you can move per turn and stuff like that.
[2715.10 → 2717.96] Did you find that equally confusing in that game?
[2719.78 → 2721.96] Well, no, it wasn't the movement that was confusing.
[2722.14 → 2723.60] It was what that orange bar was.
[2723.80 → 2725.20] I just didn't know what the heck it was.
[2725.66 → 2727.20] It was just an unlabelled orange bar.
[2727.20 → 2729.00] It doesn't even have a tool tip if you mouse over it.
[2729.12 → 2729.52] Oh, really?
[2729.52 → 2730.44] Yeah, it's just there.
[2731.00 → 2731.44] Okay.
[2732.40 → 2738.90] So there's a lot of stuff that's just not labelled, which, no, that's not good.
[2740.48 → 2741.08] Hold on.
[2741.18 → 2750.46] Someone, there was a comment in the chat that I had wanted to address really quick there, but I guess I missed it.
[2751.66 → 2754.20] Yeah, I mean, people are talking about tutorials.
[2754.38 → 2756.72] Like, yeah, you don't have to play tutorials.
[2756.96 → 2757.84] Oh, yeah, no, here we go.
[2757.92 → 2758.48] Lord Dude.
[2758.48 → 2761.22] I didn't know what 1D20 plus meant.
[2761.40 → 2762.32] Had to watch a tutorial.
[2763.02 → 2765.42] No, yeah, Yvonne had no idea.
[2765.70 → 2769.70] Having some optional, like, how dice work in this game.
[2770.04 → 2771.02] It wasn't, okay.
[2771.84 → 2774.12] By default, eavesdrops not enabled.
[2774.96 → 2777.06] So we were independently.
[2777.72 → 2778.14] Are you sure?
[2778.22 → 2778.96] Yeah, I'm sure.
[2779.06 → 2780.40] I'm 100% sure.
[2780.40 → 2783.14] Eavesdrop was not enabled by default.
[2783.14 → 2789.10] Which meant that both of us had cut scenes running and were not engaged with them at the same time.
[2789.16 → 2795.90] Also, that annoyance that Proof brought up, where your best character for a particular role is not necessarily the one that participates in it.
[2795.90 → 2798.22] Apparently there's some way to solve that.
[2798.28 → 2804.80] Sure, but when you're playing in co-op, whoever initiates a conversation...
[2804.80 → 2805.64] How can you not solve it?
[2805.64 → 2806.74] It doesn't seem like it.
[2806.78 → 2808.56] So there was one where we tried to...
[2808.56 → 2812.50] Where there's, like, a dead mind flayer or something, or dying mind flayer.
[2812.86 → 2815.36] This is very early on, so it's not a spoiler or anything.
[2815.46 → 2817.86] If you haven't got to that point, you haven't played the game yet.
[2817.88 → 2819.48] Yeah, so there's a dying mind flayer.
[2819.80 → 2821.76] And I was the one who started the conversation.
[2821.76 → 2825.48] And my character was not as good at whatever it is that we were trying to do.
[2825.60 → 2827.72] So I tried to just disengage from the conversation.
[2828.32 → 2829.16] But that's it.
[2829.22 → 2832.54] Once you've done it, the tree is completed.
[2832.86 → 2836.58] And when Yvonne tried to do the thing, it was not an option anymore.
[2836.58 → 2844.24] So there are definitely some frustrations.
[2847.70 → 2849.08] Okay, let's go on.
[2850.32 → 2854.00] As someone who has had trouble getting into the more hardcore D&D-style games in the past,
[2854.10 → 2856.48] this lack of instructions is particularly unhelpful.
[2856.86 → 2860.38] My mage levelled up, I chose Magic Missile, and I couldn't find it anywhere in my toolbar.
[2861.04 → 2862.50] That part I wasn't sure.
[2862.70 → 2863.74] I don't know. I can't find it.
[2863.74 → 2869.12] But also, just the fact that your toolbars are separated into actions, whatever.
[2869.44 → 2870.00] Minor actions.
[2870.08 → 2871.24] Other more different actions.
[2871.56 → 2875.80] And then tertiary, basically mostly useless actions.
[2876.34 → 2880.22] And then if you click twice, it's all of them, and then it's just those.
[2880.28 → 2883.10] It's a toggle, but it's not really clear that it's toggled.
[2883.10 → 2889.06] So Yvonne was really confused by what all these actions are,
[2889.14 → 2892.06] and why some of them get grayed out, and some of them don't.
[2893.08 → 2894.72] Like spell slots and stuff like that.
[2895.22 → 2897.26] Order as well, I don't think it's explained.
[2897.66 → 2901.98] Like you can only do stuff in a certain order, and some of it's a bonus action,
[2902.12 → 2905.18] but if you do it without doing the bonus action, then you don't get to do it.
[2906.06 → 2907.76] It's all kind of like D&D rules, right?
[2907.76 → 2908.16] Yeah.
[2909.16 → 2911.74] I had to hold her hand on things as simple as movement.
[2912.06 → 2912.20] Yeah.
[2912.94 → 2913.70] Cantrips, yeah.
[2913.90 → 2914.86] That's what...
[2914.86 → 2916.96] Is she playing a spell caster?
[2917.74 → 2918.16] Yes.
[2918.36 → 2919.82] It is significantly harder.
[2920.20 → 2920.76] Well, there you go.
[2920.78 → 2921.70] It's much more complicated.
[2921.76 → 2925.76] She just picked based on who she thought had the coolest backstory, so...
[2927.12 → 2928.42] And she picked a spell caster.
[2928.68 → 2930.68] Yeah, I can't remember which one it is.
[2930.74 → 2932.74] It's someone that looks like something.
[2933.02 → 2933.34] Gale?
[2933.60 → 2933.80] White?
[2934.36 → 2934.76] No.
[2935.20 → 2935.42] No.
[2935.42 → 2936.66] No, it's the other one, I guess.
[2938.04 → 2938.66] I don't know.
[2938.78 → 2939.18] It doesn't matter.
[2940.02 → 2940.42] Wait.
[2941.56 → 2941.82] What?
[2942.08 → 2944.34] Did she pick the one that Wendell picked?
[2944.54 → 2947.14] The Hunger or whatever?
[2947.68 → 2948.18] I don't know.
[2948.30 → 2949.46] It doesn't look very humanoid.
[2949.74 → 2952.20] It's like a dragon born, but I don't think you know what that means.
[2952.28 → 2952.64] Sure, maybe.
[2953.42 → 2954.28] I can't remember.
[2954.54 → 2955.16] Oh, Will!
[2955.60 → 2958.38] Ah, that actually totally makes sense.
[2959.24 → 2959.62] All right.
[2959.76 → 2959.98] Yeah.
[2960.56 → 2963.64] I find character selection kind of annoying.
[2963.64 → 2967.14] I want to click on things without just moving all the time necessarily.
[2967.84 → 2970.42] And like escape doesn't just give you a cursor.
[2970.96 → 2973.46] I just want a cursor that I can just like click on things with.
[2974.14 → 2975.52] So I was finding that kind of annoying.
[2975.94 → 2976.42] Character selection?
[2977.90 → 2980.52] Oh, you can just click them in the sidebar on the left.
[2980.52 → 2985.22] Or I could just press escape and then f***ING click them.
[2985.60 → 2986.28] What do you think of that?
[2986.40 → 2986.94] There's an idea.
[2987.46 → 2988.12] How about that?
[2988.16 → 2989.78] Like every other game that's ever existed.
[2990.00 → 2991.22] I like the sidebar thing.
[2991.28 → 2991.44] Cool.
[2991.54 → 2992.76] Then that should be an option for you.
[2993.08 → 2994.72] And then if I press escape...
[2994.72 → 2994.80] Do both!
[2994.80 → 2995.42] Do both!
[2995.42 → 3001.10] Something as simple as unselecting my active characters.
[3001.20 → 3001.70] Kind of annoying.
[3001.80 → 3003.00] It always just wants to move them.
[3003.22 → 3005.22] And I'm sure there's a better way to do all of this stuff.
[3005.34 → 3006.44] Like it's just...
[3006.44 → 3012.62] Remember, this entire thing is based on that we've played not even the full tutorial section
[3012.62 → 3013.54] of the game yet.
[3013.78 → 3017.26] So this is not a review.
[3017.48 → 3018.78] This is not that at all.
[3019.56 → 3020.54] Blah, blah, blah.
[3020.76 → 3021.84] More camera complaints.
[3021.84 → 3025.10] I said the setup for the story is interesting enough that we played for a couple of hours though.
[3025.18 → 3026.28] The cinematic are super cool.
[3026.34 → 3028.28] I think we will try again was my conclusion.
[3029.44 → 3029.52] Yeah.
[3029.66 → 3032.26] So yeah, we haven't played again yet because I've been extremely busy.
[3033.08 → 3033.84] But...
[3033.84 → 3035.16] F***s.
[3035.16 → 3036.20] First, hilarious.
[3036.42 → 3038.76] There's an ad for Linus Active Screwdriver.
[3039.78 → 3040.36] Oh, nice.
[3041.46 → 3043.82] But he didn't see it at first because he can't see ads.
[3045.28 → 3046.94] Actually, I was not aware of it.
[3047.08 → 3048.84] The way that you said, oh, nice.
[3048.92 → 3050.36] I was like, yeah, he didn't see it at all.
[3050.36 → 3054.12] When you told me there's an ad for...
[3054.12 → 3055.56] I was...
[3055.56 → 3059.94] All I had seen was native camera tweaks thumbnail thing.
[3060.06 → 3062.16] I hadn't processed anything above that.
[3062.74 → 3062.94] Yeah.
[3063.58 → 3067.78] But yeah, native open source plugin providing several camera tweaks.
[3068.40 → 3071.74] Unlocked camera pitch, zoom, and controller stick dead zone.
[3071.82 → 3073.38] No server executables configurable.
[3073.94 → 3075.06] 300,000 downloads.
[3075.44 → 3075.60] So...
[3075.60 → 3075.96] Very nice.
[3075.96 → 3083.50] Luckily, I think a lot of the problems that you have with the game are like functions or like...
[3084.42 → 3087.50] I don't know if I want to say mechanics, but like...
[3088.02 → 3091.18] Things that are solvable.
[3091.18 → 3096.28] Because I don't think your problems with the game are like the story or any of that kind of stuff.
[3096.38 → 3101.48] So it might be worth looking into some modding if they do bother you that much.
[3101.60 → 3103.18] But I think...
[3103.18 → 3104.94] I've thought since it released...
[3104.94 → 3107.30] I think this is game of the year.
[3107.30 → 3119.28] And the fact that it is just refusing to let go of its like top three most played Steam position is crazy for how long it's been out.
[3119.42 → 3123.86] As a not like competitive online game.
[3125.46 → 3126.68] It's co-op, sure.
[3126.80 → 3128.32] But other than that, it's not online.
[3128.46 → 3131.36] So you'd think people would like to play it and then stop.
[3131.36 → 3133.94] It's also not even a super accessible game.
[3134.06 → 3134.16] No.
[3134.16 → 3135.68] Which is, I guess, what I was trying to say.
[3135.76 → 3138.42] It's not like as a non-gamer, you can just jump right into this.
[3139.40 → 3140.00] Like I...
[3140.00 → 3141.50] I mean, okay, back to It Takes Two.
[3142.42 → 3149.90] That was a co-op game that as a non-gamer, you could pretty much jump into if you had a gamer friend or a gamer SO.
[3151.08 → 3152.84] This, I mean...
[3152.84 → 3154.46] Yeah, it...
[3154.46 → 3154.78] Wow.
[3154.86 → 3156.26] And it's demanding, too.
[3156.34 → 3160.56] It's not even just something that, you know, anyone can run on any ancient computer.
[3160.56 → 3161.62] Yeah, it takes a bit to run.
[3161.76 → 3167.60] You're asking for a lot of ducks to align to play this game at all.
[3168.58 → 3169.56] Yeah, no, I'm...
[3170.38 → 3172.98] It's been pretty interesting so far.
[3173.26 → 3175.18] Yeah, I do want to play more of it.
[3176.38 → 3182.56] I will say, I already know that I prefer the more Norrie...
[3183.32 → 3189.46] Like, I guess it's like the equivalent of playing a super arcade-y racing game versus playing a sim.
[3189.46 → 3190.72] Like, I...
[3190.72 → 3193.62] I'd rather just play Dragon Age, personally.
[3194.14 → 3194.46] But...
[3195.60 → 3198.00] I'm really going to try this time.
[3200.34 → 3200.78] Really.
[3201.78 → 3202.22] Yeah.
[3202.60 → 3202.84] Yeah.
[3204.18 → 3204.62] Yeah.
[3205.10 → 3206.46] I've, uh...
[3206.46 → 3207.86] I don't know.
[3208.10 → 3208.98] It's a fantastic game.
[3209.08 → 3211.88] Unless City Skylines 2 comes out, and I just get completely distracted.
[3212.38 → 3213.46] City Skylines?
[3213.46 → 3214.80] I've never got...
[3214.80 → 3216.18] I never got into City Skylines.
[3216.54 → 3216.70] Yeah.
[3216.80 → 3217.04] Um...
[3217.04 → 3219.24] Why do you think you're going to get into 2 if you never got into 1?
[3219.34 → 3220.46] That's why I was surprised by it.
[3220.46 → 3222.18] Because people are super jazzed on it.
[3222.20 → 3225.90] I love Anna, and I've been told I would love City Skylines and City Skylines 2 is coming.
[3225.98 → 3227.40] It seems like a good excuse to try it.
[3227.88 → 3228.04] Hmm.
[3228.04 → 3230.50] And I'll probably like it more than this.
[3231.44 → 3232.46] Because it's city building.
[3232.70 → 3237.36] Which I like more than fighting with obtuse controls.
[3239.14 → 3241.26] And I'll stick with my Baldur's Gate.
[3241.40 → 3242.02] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3242.12 → 3242.44] No, no.
[3242.50 → 3242.82] That's good.
[3242.90 → 3243.22] That's good.
[3243.24 → 3247.40] I have zero issue fighting with obtuse controls as an enjoyer of things like Star Citizen.
[3247.98 → 3248.04] Um...
[3248.72 → 3251.14] Doesn't bother me at all.
[3251.14 → 3252.26] That's a feature for you.
[3252.34 → 3253.42] It might be at this point.
[3253.44 → 3253.82] I don't know.
[3253.82 → 3254.42] Uh...
[3254.42 → 3255.50] Another thing I'll point out...
[3255.50 → 3255.78] Just a masochist.
[3256.08 → 3256.46] Uh...
[3256.46 → 3257.34] It's Steam reviews.
[3258.10 → 3260.16] 300,000 overwhelmingly positive.
[3260.52 → 3263.16] The all-time reviews are 95% positive.
[3263.30 → 3264.64] The recent...
[3264.64 → 3265.16] 96.
[3266.70 → 3267.54] It's improving.
[3267.64 → 3269.24] People like it even more.
[3269.36 → 3271.08] Yeah, because they've released some updates.
[3271.86 → 3272.22] Uh...
[3272.22 → 3275.08] And the updates, I believe, have been fairly well received.
[3275.44 → 3275.80] Uh...
[3275.80 → 3276.86] I know, like...
[3276.86 → 3279.56] I think one of them introduced a new bug.
[3279.56 → 3281.62] But then they had a hot fix out like that.
[3282.04 → 3283.44] So they fixed it, like, right away.
[3283.82 → 3284.10] Um...
[3284.10 → 3290.68] They've even released updates that fix things that people pointed out that they didn't like very much, like, narratively.
[3291.40 → 3296.86] They, like, changed potential stories and stuff to make it better.
[3297.54 → 3298.86] It's like, whoa.
[3299.26 → 3300.28] That's pretty cool.
[3300.78 → 3300.98] Wow.
[3301.04 → 3301.42] Interesting.
[3301.42 → 3308.42] I think there are an insane amount of potential paths they could take with things like DLCs.
[3308.42 → 3309.82] Um...
[3309.82 → 3313.88] And I think, honestly, if they didn't do content-based DLCs at this point...
[3313.88 → 3314.46] They'd be crazy.
[3314.52 → 3315.42] That would just be stupid.
[3315.64 → 3318.06] They would actually be crazy not to do that right now.
[3318.06 → 3318.08] Yeah.
[3318.24 → 3320.96] They should absolutely release content DLCs for this game.
[3321.08 → 3323.98] And honestly, make it decently big and charge some money for it.
[3324.26 → 3324.36] Like...
[3324.36 → 3324.52] Yeah.
[3324.80 → 3325.34] No, I could...
[3325.34 → 3327.28] I could easily see $39.99.
[3327.28 → 3328.64] Easy.
[3329.00 → 3330.82] For, like, here's another...
[3330.82 → 3332.56] Another land to explore.
[3332.70 → 3333.38] Another act.
[3333.78 → 3334.22] A whole...
[3334.22 → 3335.96] Because the game's in three acts or whatever.
[3336.18 → 3337.56] If you release a fourth act, like...
[3338.68 → 3339.56] Holy...
[3340.56 → 3341.10] I don't know.
[3341.34 → 3342.04] I would kill.
[3342.68 → 3343.28] Um...
[3343.28 → 3344.74] But yeah, Marian's been awesome forever.
[3344.96 → 3345.74] I have this...
[3345.74 → 3347.78] I have a record, um...
[3347.78 → 3350.98] From Divinity Original Sin 2 that's signed by a bunch of the developers.
[3351.26 → 3352.24] And I just...
[3352.24 → 3355.48] I've been a Marian enjoyer for a while now.
[3355.54 → 3356.12] And I'm just...
[3356.12 → 3358.58] I'm very happy with them with the success of Baldur's Gate.
[3358.66 → 3361.34] And it's wild to me that it's still so incredibly successful.
[3361.34 → 3361.86] Marian enthusiast.
[3362.18 → 3362.44] Yeah.
[3363.18 → 3363.40] Yeah.
[3363.80 → 3364.98] We should explain merch messages.
[3365.28 → 3365.50] Yeah.
[3365.94 → 3369.32] If you guys want to interact with the show, the way to do it is...
[3369.32 → 3370.28] Merch messages!
[3371.28 → 3371.60] Uh...
[3371.60 → 3374.46] We don't do Twitch bits or Super Chats or anything like that.
[3374.46 → 3375.86] Because the way we see it...
[3375.86 → 3381.36] If you guys are throwing money at your screen, you should get something out of your screen in return.
[3381.52 → 3382.56] Like, say for example...
[3382.56 → 3382.70] Ooh!
[3384.42 → 3387.30] One of these new Technicolor Keys Desk pads!
[3387.34 → 3389.66] This is a really cool design from the team.
[3390.32 → 3390.96] Um...
[3390.96 → 3392.42] Yeah.
[3392.50 → 3393.62] It was Lloyd who worked on this one.
[3393.98 → 3395.12] Let me just have a quick look here.
[3396.06 → 3396.32] Alright.
[3396.34 → 3396.68] You know what?
[3397.72 → 3398.70] Luke's going to open it.
[3399.20 → 3399.52] Hey!
[3400.04 → 3400.76] Good job, Luke.
[3401.04 → 3401.40] Uh...
[3401.40 → 3403.66] So all you have to do is go to LTTstore.com
[3403.66 → 3406.94] and in the cart, you will see a little box whenever we're live.
[3407.02 → 3408.08] You can fill in a merch message.
[3408.20 → 3409.70] It might go to Producer Dan.
[3409.84 → 3410.44] There he is.
[3410.86 → 3411.12] Uh...
[3411.12 → 3411.72] Oh, sorry, Dan.
[3411.78 → 3412.10] There you go.
[3412.16 → 3412.62] Go ahead and wave.
[3412.92 → 3413.20] Sorry.
[3413.32 → 3413.76] Sorry, Dan.
[3413.86 → 3414.66] Ah, it slipped on the...
[3414.66 → 3415.06] Oh, the button!
[3416.06 → 3416.84] It's so bad!
[3417.38 → 3417.78] Um...
[3417.78 → 3420.94] So it'll go to Producer Dan, and it'll either show up down here
[3420.94 → 3422.64] or he'll type you up a little reply
[3422.64 → 3426.24] or he will curate it for me and Luke to talk about later.
[3426.76 → 3427.44] I have...
[3427.44 → 3429.64] I have this one really persistent...
[3429.64 → 3431.22] Do you remember that person who sent, like,
[3431.22 → 3434.06] two $50 super chats in the same WAN show
[3434.06 → 3435.82] or $100 super chats or something like that
[3435.82 → 3438.86] insisting that we find a way to do super chats
[3438.86 → 3439.80] instead of merch messages
[3439.80 → 3442.64] because he actually dug up my email
[3442.64 → 3446.04] and also emailed me his whole persuasive argument
[3446.04 → 3448.24] for why we should allow that
[3448.24 → 3449.90] because he doesn't want more stuff.
[3450.40 → 3452.52] He's at a point in his life where he doesn't want more stuff.
[3452.72 → 3454.00] He just wants to send us money.
[3454.70 → 3455.22] And I was like...
[3456.50 → 3457.22] Gift cards.
[3458.00 → 3458.30] Yeah.
[3458.80 → 3459.60] We have that.
[3459.60 → 3462.50] You can just buy gift cards on LTT Store
[3462.50 → 3465.06] and then you can not redeem them.
[3465.56 → 3467.20] If you do happen to want stuff,
[3467.34 → 3469.10] well, then you have the gift cards already.
[3469.26 → 3469.48] Yeah.
[3469.72 → 3471.52] Or if you're just...
[3471.52 → 3473.42] If you just want to throw money at us,
[3473.54 → 3476.76] we really do insist that we give something back for it
[3476.76 → 3478.42] so you could just buy gift cards
[3478.42 → 3480.58] and then dump the code in the chat for all I care
[3480.58 → 3481.84] and then someone else could use it.
[3482.32 → 3482.66] Yeah.
[3483.26 → 3484.04] That's an idea.
[3484.26 → 3487.36] We just think people should get something for their money.
[3487.48 → 3488.94] Why is this controversial?
[3488.94 → 3489.08] It's official.
[3490.90 → 3491.26] Yeah.
[3491.40 → 3491.90] I like it.
[3492.06 → 3492.58] I think it's good.
[3493.72 → 3496.38] Dan is holding what appears to be a note.
[3497.90 → 3499.54] Are they not code-based or something?
[3499.62 → 3500.44] What is that?
[3500.44 → 3501.44] Happy Friday.
[3502.30 → 3505.80] Creator Warehouse received some locally samples
[3505.80 → 3508.88] that we figured would be fun to debut on WAN.
[3508.88 → 3513.06] Lloyd worked on these adorable bread plushes.
[3518.34 → 3519.80] Oh my God, it's bread.
[3521.00 → 3524.54] And we would like to gauge community interest for them.
[3524.84 → 3525.30] Oh my God.
[3525.34 → 3526.38] I haven't even...
[3526.38 → 3527.10] Without even...
[3527.10 → 3528.52] I'm touching the bag on the other side.
[3528.58 → 3530.00] These are so soft.
[3530.00 → 3531.90] There are three different styles,
[3532.22 → 3533.88] each with two size options.
[3534.84 → 3535.32] Loaf.
[3536.06 → 3537.42] It feels like dough.
[3537.64 → 3538.46] Have you felt these?
[3538.74 → 3539.52] Do you know about these?
[3539.78 → 3540.46] Feel this.
[3541.60 → 3542.76] It's very soft.
[3543.52 → 3544.02] Wow.
[3544.42 → 3546.84] Loaf, bun, and baguette.
[3547.26 → 3547.66] Wow.
[3547.66 → 3550.18] Maybe you guys could help us narrow it down
[3550.18 → 3552.54] to one size and style.
[3552.78 → 3554.24] I'm assuming that's baguette?
[3554.80 → 3556.52] I think that's loaf.
[3557.90 → 3558.46] Bun?
[3558.96 → 3559.58] I think so.
[3560.02 → 3560.18] Yeah.
[3560.98 → 3563.28] See if you can find a longer, skinnier...
[3563.28 → 3563.72] Smaller bun?
[3563.76 → 3564.24] En Français!
[3564.74 → 3565.00] One.
[3566.12 → 3566.64] And that would be...
[3566.64 → 3566.82] Ah!
[3566.98 → 3568.16] There's baguette!
[3568.26 → 3568.78] Baguette!
[3570.72 → 3571.28] Sorry.
[3571.44 → 3572.68] Sorry, our French...
[3572.68 → 3573.74] Smaller bun?
[3573.90 → 3575.50] Francophone viewers.
[3575.82 → 3577.42] Oh my God, there's so much bread.
[3577.90 → 3578.54] Ah, yeah.
[3578.70 → 3580.48] My ancestry is so happy right now.
[3581.06 → 3582.04] Tiny baguette!
[3582.38 → 3582.56] Yeah.
[3583.86 → 3584.30] Okay.
[3585.34 → 3586.62] Let us know what you think.
[3586.74 → 3587.44] Thanks, Sarah.
[3587.60 → 3588.38] Oh, there are keychains?
[3589.24 → 3590.08] What, the keychains?
[3590.14 → 3590.72] Oh my God.
[3591.18 → 3592.38] Okay, well...
[3593.62 → 3596.32] I'm losing it.
[3597.46 → 3598.32] Oh, the keychains.
[3598.34 → 3599.10] This is amazing.
[3599.36 → 3600.40] I didn't know those were in there.
[3600.50 → 3601.32] I don't know what's going on.
[3601.32 → 3601.78] I don't know.
[3601.92 → 3603.82] Luke, do you want to just do a community poll
[3603.82 → 3605.96] and we'll just make whatever one they all vote for?
[3606.22 → 3606.84] There was a...
[3606.84 → 3608.24] What did she mention as well?
[3608.48 → 3610.16] They were considering doing another one
[3610.16 → 3611.58] that was a headrest
[3611.58 → 3613.42] and then calling it the bread rest.
[3613.82 → 3614.80] That's not on here.
[3615.10 → 3615.52] Bread rest.
[3615.86 → 3616.14] Yeah.
[3616.40 → 3617.22] Bread rest.
[3617.32 → 3618.12] I liked that idea.
[3618.24 → 3618.76] I thought it was cool.
[3618.86 → 3620.86] I need some bread rest to recover from this.
[3621.38 → 3621.74] What do you think...
[3621.74 → 3623.88] What do you think if you had the bun one
[3623.88 → 3625.52] and then you made it
[3625.52 → 3627.16] so that you could put your headphones on it?
[3627.98 → 3628.32] Yeah.
[3630.08 → 3631.64] I think you could just do that.
[3632.72 → 3633.96] And it could be canned bread.
[3633.96 → 3636.70] I can't stop them from getting canned bread.
[3636.76 → 3637.40] Oh, stop.
[3638.50 → 3639.84] Yeah, that doesn't work very well.
[3640.02 → 3640.50] Not very well.
[3641.00 → 3641.96] Okay, well...
[3642.84 → 3643.50] Okay, all right.
[3643.58 → 3644.64] If you're not going to do it,
[3644.68 → 3645.44] I'll do the poll.
[3646.42 → 3647.02] Dang it, Luke.
[3647.20 → 3647.84] It's too big.
[3648.02 → 3648.64] It's too big.
[3649.12 → 3649.52] Too big.
[3649.82 → 3650.56] I can do the poll.
[3650.66 → 3651.06] I already got it.
[3651.08 → 3652.40] I'm doing the poll.
[3652.92 → 3654.16] No, we'll see who can do it first.
[3654.26 → 3655.00] That's actually bad.
[3655.04 → 3656.00] We shouldn't both do a poll
[3656.00 → 3657.50] because it'll actually put both of them up.
[3657.56 → 3657.72] Fine.
[3657.76 → 3658.34] Are you doing the poll?
[3658.66 → 3659.38] I can, yeah.
[3659.38 → 3659.82] All right, fine.
[3659.82 → 3660.32] You do the poll.
[3660.44 → 3663.48] Which bread should be baked?
[3663.74 → 3664.74] Dan, do you want to hit me
[3664.74 → 3665.82] with a couple merch messages
[3665.82 → 3666.44] in the meantime?
[3667.82 → 3670.10] So it's small and big versions of each, right?
[3670.12 → 3670.60] Yeah, sure.
[3671.14 → 3671.82] And we're only making...
[3672.86 → 3675.30] Are we making both sizes of the same type?
[3675.32 → 3678.18] No, we are making one style in one size.
[3678.22 → 3679.08] One style in one size.
[3679.16 → 3679.42] Yes.
[3679.58 → 3679.84] Weak.
[3680.64 → 3682.16] I mean, okay, merch message.
[3683.04 → 3683.68] Let's see.
[3683.68 → 3686.68] Would you wipe away all of your past controversies
[3686.68 → 3688.40] if it also meant wiping away
[3688.40 → 3690.06] everything you've learned from them?
[3690.58 → 3691.32] No, of course not.
[3691.66 → 3694.28] I mean, that's always been our approach
[3694.28 → 3695.78] is that we are open.
[3695.98 → 3696.58] We're transparent.
[3696.92 → 3698.76] We take feedback.
[3699.02 → 3699.48] We care.
[3699.80 → 3701.78] None of that has ever changed.
[3703.76 → 3705.68] Also, I mean, I've been somewhat...
[3706.90 → 3707.56] I don't know.
[3707.64 → 3709.16] I mean, some of the past controversies,
[3709.24 → 3710.92] I feel like, are just sort of...
[3710.92 → 3713.46] We've turned those L's into W's at this point.
[3713.46 → 3716.42] Now that people have seen what I meant by,
[3716.80 → 3717.40] trust me, bro.
[3718.12 → 3720.44] Now that people have seen, you know,
[3720.52 → 3723.08] what our customer service looks like on the store,
[3724.26 → 3726.60] there's been a big shift.
[3726.78 → 3730.46] Like, I've seen a lot of posts over the last months
[3730.46 → 3731.86] where people are just like,
[3732.02 → 3732.84] yeah, I get it now.
[3734.24 → 3736.52] These guys are so far above and beyond
[3736.52 → 3738.18] in terms of taking care of the customer
[3738.18 → 3740.24] that I don't really understand why I ever questioned it.
[3740.28 → 3743.22] I'm like, yeah, well, obviously.
[3743.90 → 3744.78] Yeah, that looks good.
[3745.26 → 3747.84] The like, the disconnect
[3747.84 → 3750.20] from people who were angry, right,
[3750.28 → 3751.38] where on the one hand,
[3751.88 → 3756.30] they were so angry
[3756.30 → 3759.32] that we would dare to not, you know,
[3759.42 → 3761.26] honour people's warranty requests.
[3761.42 → 3762.40] And then on the other hand,
[3762.56 → 3764.96] they were so...
[3764.96 → 3766.12] They found it so unbelievable
[3766.12 → 3767.46] that we could be stupid enough
[3767.46 → 3769.22] to be a high-profile creator
[3769.22 → 3771.52] and not take care of people.
[3771.52 → 3772.46] And I'm sitting here going,
[3772.56 → 3773.92] right, so you actually do understand
[3773.92 → 3775.06] the dynamic at play here.
[3775.34 → 3777.22] It's not even really an option for us.
[3777.30 → 3778.32] We have to take care of people,
[3778.44 → 3780.10] whether we like to or not.
[3780.12 → 3781.00] And we do like to.
[3781.18 → 3782.94] So, you know, don't worry about it.
[3783.80 → 3785.16] Yeah, I just, I don't know.
[3785.30 → 3786.52] Yeah, I...
[3787.40 → 3787.64] Small.
[3788.36 → 3789.52] I don't think you can...
[3791.52 → 3795.16] People are asking for a demonstration in order,
[3795.40 → 3796.04] so I'm doing it.
[3796.04 → 3796.72] Small.
[3796.72 → 3797.20] There.
[3799.46 → 3802.02] I don't think you can really enjoy where you are
[3802.02 → 3804.88] without the journey that got you there.
[3805.06 → 3806.16] You have to fight through some stuff.
[3806.24 → 3807.36] Yeah, without all that context.
[3807.44 → 3810.52] I don't think we'd appreciate our position here
[3810.52 → 3813.16] and, you know, everything we have
[3813.16 → 3814.08] if we hadn't earned it.
[3814.18 → 3815.46] I certainly wouldn't.
[3816.64 → 3818.38] No, I wouldn't change a thing.
[3818.60 → 3820.18] I disagree with the poll results.
[3821.42 → 3821.82] What?
[3821.82 → 3822.14] What?
[3822.38 → 3824.60] Why would you try to influence the people's vote?
[3824.88 → 3825.36] I'm just saying.
[3825.36 → 3828.44] So what's currently running is Loaf Big,
[3829.00 → 3829.74] which is this one.
[3829.86 → 3830.58] Oh, dang it.
[3830.64 → 3831.54] I showed the dashboard again.
[3831.70 → 3832.38] Well, you're welcome.
[3832.78 → 3835.22] And this one might be the most aesthetically pleasing.
[3835.58 → 3836.86] I will potentially agree.
[3837.32 → 3840.54] But Bun Big, I believe, is just superior.
[3840.84 → 3842.38] These guys, they haven't, like, felt them.
[3842.56 → 3843.10] Yeah, exactly.
[3843.10 → 3844.90] And I think if they could, like, touch them,
[3844.94 → 3845.70] they would get Bun Big.
[3846.16 → 3847.50] Bun Big is, like...
[3847.50 → 3848.16] The more...
[3848.16 → 3849.82] Just experience this.
[3849.90 → 3851.24] Go on, give it a squash.
[3851.32 → 3852.04] Just...
[3852.04 → 3852.28] Oh.
[3852.28 → 3855.92] But no, like, do that.
[3856.10 → 3857.74] And, like, play with it for a second.
[3857.86 → 3858.32] Oh my god.
[3858.72 → 3859.50] And then...
[3859.50 → 3863.26] And then experience this.
[3864.00 → 3865.10] And then vote.
[3867.50 → 3869.38] That is significantly squishier,
[3869.44 → 3870.40] but I don't get a vote.
[3871.84 → 3873.98] Bun Big, objectively better.
[3873.98 → 3877.14] That is not the conclusion.
[3877.14 → 3878.24] That's exactly what was just said.
[3878.26 → 3879.94] That is not a summary of what I said.
[3880.06 → 3880.50] Quote it.
[3881.50 → 3882.68] Put on a news article.
[3889.68 → 3890.98] You guys are hilarious.
[3891.20 → 3891.90] You know that, right?
[3894.80 → 3895.20] All right.
[3895.28 → 3896.56] You'll just have to make both.
[3896.56 → 3897.78] Okay, next message.
[3897.92 → 3898.30] I don't know.
[3898.40 → 3899.64] Greetings from Finland.
[3899.64 → 3901.16] As a fellow northerner,
[3901.26 → 3902.64] I frequently get frustrated
[3902.64 → 3903.98] by lower temperature limits
[3903.98 → 3905.32] on tech like phones
[3905.32 → 3906.22] and electric cars.
[3906.44 → 3907.94] Any personal experiences
[3907.94 → 3909.78] dealing with the big freeze?
[3910.56 → 3911.62] Yeah, I mean, of course.
[3911.86 → 3914.28] Not with my car so much.
[3915.62 → 3916.30] I...
[3916.30 → 3922.14] I would say on the Volt,
[3922.28 → 3923.60] it was more of an issue
[3923.60 → 3924.40] for me in the winter.
[3924.88 → 3925.94] Like, the Taycan has more
[3925.94 → 3926.92] than enough range for me
[3926.92 → 3927.38] day to day,
[3927.46 → 3928.06] so it doesn't...
[3928.06 → 3929.30] It just really doesn't matter.
[3929.30 → 3930.08] I have a charger at home,
[3930.12 → 3930.98] I have a charger at work,
[3931.02 → 3931.98] and I never go anywhere.
[3932.24 → 3933.80] So, to and from work,
[3933.82 → 3935.22] or maybe I drive to badminton
[3935.22 → 3936.06] or something like that.
[3936.10 → 3937.28] I never come even close
[3937.28 → 3938.04] to running out of range
[3938.04 → 3938.68] even in the winter.
[3939.12 → 3939.88] But on the Volt,
[3940.40 → 3942.82] my on-battery range
[3942.82 → 3944.08] was like 60%
[3944.08 → 3945.12] of what it is in the summer.
[3945.32 → 3946.62] So, yeah,
[3946.66 → 3947.52] I would sometimes end up
[3947.52 → 3948.12] burning gas
[3948.12 → 3949.50] when I, in the summer,
[3949.62 → 3950.54] wouldn't have to
[3950.54 → 3951.74] just with my daily commute.
[3952.56 → 3953.28] But, I mean,
[3953.84 → 3955.58] I'd say the more obnoxious one
[3955.58 → 3956.24] is with my phone.
[3956.38 → 3957.80] Like, on a particularly cold day,
[3957.80 → 3959.10] the last thing you want
[3959.10 → 3960.40] is to be, you know,
[3960.48 → 3961.76] outside calling an Uber
[3961.76 → 3963.24] or looking up a bus schedule
[3963.24 → 3964.34] or something like that
[3964.34 → 3965.46] and your phone's like,
[3965.66 → 3966.86] thermal shut off
[3966.86 → 3968.12] or like, you have like,
[3968.20 → 3968.44] you know,
[3968.52 → 3969.76] 8% battery left
[3969.76 → 3970.40] and it's just like,
[3970.72 → 3971.36] book, nope.
[3971.52 → 3973.06] The voltage dropped too low
[3973.06 → 3973.80] even though,
[3973.90 → 3977.52] like, the juices
[3977.52 → 3978.64] are still in there.
[3979.36 → 3980.02] Yeah, no,
[3980.10 → 3981.38] it's pretty frustrating.
[3981.38 → 3982.94] But that's one of the things
[3982.94 → 3983.76] that we're hoping
[3983.76 → 3985.36] that our more extensive
[3985.36 → 3986.70] testing in the lab
[3986.70 → 3988.08] once we've got everything
[3988.08 → 3988.58] ramped up,
[3988.64 → 3990.52] which is still going to take
[3990.52 → 3991.18] a lot of time.
[3991.44 → 3992.22] Once we've got everything
[3992.22 → 3992.68] ramped up,
[3992.72 → 3993.40] once we've got everything
[3993.40 → 3993.80] ramped up,
[3993.84 → 3994.44] that's the kind of thing
[3994.44 → 3995.50] we're hoping to address.
[3995.60 → 3995.94] Like, yeah,
[3996.06 → 3998.52] who has great battery life?
[3999.56 → 3999.88] Right.
[4000.06 → 4001.62] But who has great battery life
[4001.62 → 4003.04] when it's so chilly?
[4004.74 → 4005.80] We're in a great position
[4005.80 → 4006.74] to be able to answer that.
[4006.78 → 4007.66] It's just going to take some time.
[4007.76 → 4008.20] It's an interesting question
[4008.20 → 4008.68] because, like,
[4008.88 → 4011.34] my girlfriend can make it
[4011.34 → 4012.82] to work in the summer
[4012.82 → 4014.44] just fine on just battery
[4014.44 → 4016.58] but can't when it's freezing out.
[4017.52 → 4018.94] Knowing that before she bought the car
[4018.94 → 4020.02] might have been interesting.
[4020.18 → 4020.74] I don't know if it would have
[4020.74 → 4021.40] changed the decision
[4021.40 → 4022.40] but it would have been interesting.
[4022.48 → 4023.04] I don't think so either
[4023.04 → 4024.02] because I tried to change
[4024.02 → 4024.58] that decision.
[4024.78 → 4024.98] Yeah.
[4025.54 → 4026.08] I mean,
[4026.12 → 4027.16] I'm not going to throw anyone
[4027.16 → 4027.94] under the bus,
[4028.44 → 4029.10] plant time.
[4030.90 → 4032.00] But I told you
[4032.00 → 4032.70] to get a Volt.
[4033.00 → 4033.90] She likes her car.
[4034.32 → 4034.98] It's done well.
[4035.06 → 4035.36] Good.
[4035.92 → 4036.14] Yeah.
[4036.62 → 4037.28] I'm glad.
[4037.54 → 4037.78] Yeah.
[4038.20 → 4043.08] Oh my goodness.
[4044.30 → 4045.42] New poll of the top three winners
[4045.42 → 4047.02] to clarify results.
[4047.16 → 4047.38] Yeah.
[4048.90 → 4050.82] Clearly nobody wants the small ones.
[4051.12 → 4051.38] Yeah.
[4052.60 → 4053.66] Should I just do that?
[4054.32 → 4055.20] Should I do another poll
[4055.20 → 4055.74] with the big one?
[4055.80 → 4056.20] Sure.
[4056.40 → 4056.72] Fine.
[4058.96 → 4060.20] Sometimes we don't like that.
[4061.00 → 4061.44] Alright.
[4061.56 → 4062.02] Do you want to hit me
[4062.02 → 4063.12] with another merch message, Dan?
[4063.66 → 4064.56] Oh, you want one more?
[4064.56 → 4064.96] Sure.
[4065.34 → 4066.14] Let's see.
[4066.14 → 4071.52] Yay, Wans ho 2.
[4071.92 → 4073.22] Over the years of Wans ho,
[4073.32 → 4074.50] how many times has Linus,
[4074.52 → 4075.42] or probably not,
[4075.66 → 4077.12] but possibly Luke or Dan,
[4077.48 → 4079.78] said something that caused chaos
[4079.78 → 4081.02] within LMG?
[4082.46 → 4083.86] Chaos within LMG?
[4084.52 → 4086.04] Within it was the final fire.
[4086.24 → 4086.40] Yeah.
[4086.40 → 4089.26] I, uh, yeah, definitely chaos.
[4089.36 → 4090.42] I think I win that one.
[4090.42 → 4092.42] But chaos within LMG?
[4092.48 → 4093.38] I would say whenever,
[4093.62 → 4096.46] whenever I cause chaos without LMG,
[4096.68 → 4099.12] it does cause some chaos within LMG.
[4099.22 → 4100.74] But there are also a lot of situations
[4100.74 → 4102.20] where that chaos outside
[4102.20 → 4104.46] does not translate to chaos inside
[4104.46 → 4106.48] because everyone knows that it's fine
[4106.48 → 4107.04] or whatever.
[4107.04 → 4108.20] Um,
[4108.94 → 4110.62] I, I don't,
[4110.68 → 4111.26] I don't know.
[4111.36 → 4112.56] You guys will have to tell me.
[4112.66 → 4112.90] Is there,
[4112.98 → 4113.56] is there anything,
[4113.76 → 4115.02] just in general,
[4115.02 → 4116.86] people definitely don't like hearing
[4116.86 → 4118.04] about things on Wans ho
[4118.04 → 4119.70] when they are sort of internal matters.
[4120.00 → 4120.36] Uh,
[4120.36 → 4121.48] but we're doing better at that.
[4121.94 → 4122.32] Um,
[4122.34 → 4123.22] everyone internally
[4123.22 → 4125.34] got the LTX cancellation announcement
[4125.34 → 4127.32] four days before we announced it
[4127.32 → 4127.86] on Wans ho.
[4127.86 → 4129.06] So,
[4129.18 → 4129.86] and we,
[4129.92 → 4130.14] we,
[4130.24 → 4131.80] we have an internal thing
[4131.80 → 4133.00] that's like any announcements
[4133.00 → 4134.18] that did happen on Wans ho
[4134.18 → 4135.62] get mentioned in the
[4135.62 → 4136.32] uh,
[4136.90 → 4138.04] Monday morning meeting email.
[4138.26 → 4139.68] So you don't have to watch it.
[4139.68 → 4140.66] Just so people don't like to have to watch it,
[4140.68 → 4142.38] which helps a bit as well.
[4144.12 → 4144.56] Uh,
[4144.80 → 4145.78] chaos though.
[4145.90 → 4147.16] Have I ever caused chaos?
[4147.96 → 4148.40] No,
[4148.46 → 4148.76] I think,
[4148.84 → 4149.84] I think you kind of hit it
[4149.84 → 4150.84] right at the beginning
[4150.84 → 4151.66] when you were like,
[4151.74 → 4153.28] when external chaos is created
[4153.28 → 4154.44] that also intern,
[4154.64 → 4156.14] that also creates internal chaos.
[4156.14 → 4156.44] Like,
[4156.82 → 4157.66] I think they're the same.
[4157.66 → 4158.02] Often.
[4159.12 → 4159.54] Yeah.
[4159.62 → 4160.10] I mean,
[4160.20 → 4161.28] most of what I,
[4161.40 → 4162.24] most of what I talk about
[4162.24 → 4162.86] on Wans ho.
[4162.98 → 4163.16] Merch leaks.
[4163.96 → 4165.58] Tynan says merch leaks.
[4165.94 → 4165.98] Oh.
[4167.04 → 4167.56] I mean,
[4167.58 → 4168.52] that's not really chaos.
[4168.74 → 4170.34] That's inconvenience for Tynan.
[4171.30 → 4172.18] Poor Tynan.
[4172.28 → 4172.44] Yeah.
[4172.50 → 4172.94] That's like,
[4173.02 → 4173.50] it's a
[4173.54 → 4173.76] it's,
[4173.80 → 4174.14] it's a
[4174.18 → 4174.58] it's a
[4174.58 → 4176.22] it's a very big storm
[4176.22 → 4176.86] in a very,
[4176.86 → 4177.46] you know,
[4177.56 → 4178.72] contained teacup.
[4179.54 → 4180.92] The Tynan teacup.
[4181.68 → 4182.78] That's my nickname for him.
[4183.00 → 4183.94] His name's Tynan's.
[4184.02 → 4184.80] He's teacup.
[4185.20 → 4185.56] Really?
[4185.78 → 4186.04] No,
[4186.12 → 4186.52] not at all.
[4186.52 → 4186.80] Okay.
[4186.80 → 4187.16] I was like,
[4187.16 → 4188.94] completely made that up on the spot.
[4189.14 → 4189.98] That's not a thing,
[4190.10 → 4190.78] even a little bit.
[4190.82 → 4191.08] Yeah.
[4191.36 → 4191.54] Yeah.
[4191.80 → 4195.10] Other people are agreeing with Tynan.
[4195.16 → 4195.32] Yeah,
[4195.38 → 4195.50] but,
[4195.56 → 4196.66] because I think that teacup might be the entire,
[4196.66 → 4198.42] Sebastian's from his department.
[4198.56 → 4198.70] Yeah,
[4198.74 → 4199.88] but it might be the whole building.
[4200.30 → 4200.52] Yeah,
[4200.58 → 4202.76] he's also just might have his bros back though.
[4203.10 → 4206.28] Maybe he hasn't experienced any of the aforementioned chaos.
[4206.54 → 4207.06] Who knows?
[4207.06 → 4207.42] Yeah,
[4207.50 → 4210.20] and Sebastian should be team Sebastian with me.
[4211.04 → 4211.48] Oh.
[4211.66 → 4211.98] Yeah.
[4212.26 → 4212.60] Yeah.
[4212.72 → 4213.14] Come on,
[4213.20 → 4213.66] Sebastian.
[4214.02 → 4214.28] Yeah.
[4214.38 → 4216.06] Be a Sebastian bro here.
[4218.78 → 4219.70] Oh God,
[4219.78 → 4220.80] Elijah's in here too.
[4220.88 → 4222.20] Why do people who work,
[4222.34 → 4223.34] people who work here,
[4223.40 → 4224.54] don't you guys get enough of me?
[4225.12 → 4225.88] I wouldn't watch.
[4225.88 → 4226.48] You have to watch.
[4226.48 → 4229.74] I'm glad I don't have to watch the Sancho.
[4232.04 → 4232.44] Dude,
[4232.68 → 4233.38] back in the day.
[4233.42 → 4236.58] I've got so many other things to be looking at than you guys.
[4237.42 → 4238.58] We've talked about this before,
[4238.66 → 4239.24] but back in the day,
[4239.30 → 4241.70] we would take turns, and we do the Sancho,
[4241.78 → 4244.70] then we would have to watch the whole thing and do timestamps for it.
[4244.76 → 4246.42] It was horrible.
[4246.68 → 4247.60] It was the worst.
[4247.74 → 4249.14] And then you don't want to watch it.
[4249.18 → 4250.32] So your brain's going to wander.
[4250.56 → 4252.92] And then you have to go back and watch that section again.
[4253.04 → 4254.66] It was so bad.
[4255.42 → 4256.18] Off topic.
[4256.48 → 4257.80] Talking about bread again.
[4258.00 → 4258.34] Yeah.
[4258.60 → 4260.74] I probably influenced the vote too much,
[4261.12 → 4263.56] which is one of the reasons why I wasn't sure if we should even do it again.
[4263.64 → 4265.58] Because people definitely voted bun.
[4266.80 → 4271.92] Bun is the most comfortable and nice to like touch and play with.
[4273.54 → 4274.58] You heard it here.
[4274.80 → 4275.76] He's an ass man.
[4278.62 → 4279.28] Bye too.
[4279.88 → 4280.44] Oh dang it.
[4280.48 → 4281.20] I showed this again.
[4282.14 → 4282.58] Whatever.
[4283.32 → 4284.02] So like,
[4284.10 → 4284.24] yeah,
[4284.24 → 4284.58] that's,
[4284.68 → 4284.84] I'll,
[4284.84 → 4285.68] I'll say that.
[4285.68 → 4286.32] Um,
[4286.70 → 4286.94] yeah,
[4286.96 → 4287.48] people are like,
[4287.54 → 4288.64] but loaf is the meme.
[4289.22 → 4290.08] Loaf is the meme.
[4290.08 → 4290.98] You did get that wrong,
[4291.08 → 4291.26] Luke.
[4291.44 → 4291.70] No,
[4291.78 → 4292.16] that's okay.
[4292.24 → 4293.14] That's not necessarily true.
[4293.22 → 4293.34] Yeah.
[4293.42 → 4294.30] Bread is the meme.
[4294.42 → 4294.60] Yeah.
[4294.76 → 4295.04] Yeah.
[4295.22 → 4295.58] No,
[4295.72 → 4296.78] that's not quite right.
[4296.88 → 4299.94] Some of the logos that have to do with the meme are baguettes.
[4300.44 → 4301.00] Um,
[4301.00 → 4301.28] like,
[4301.34 → 4305.64] I believe the float plane and LTT logos are made out of baguettes.
[4306.28 → 4306.60] All right.
[4306.60 → 4306.98] Well,
[4307.10 → 4307.38] Luke,
[4307.52 → 4307.92] you win.
[4308.86 → 4309.30] You win.
[4309.38 → 4309.74] It's bun.
[4309.82 → 4310.48] It's big bun,
[4311.04 → 4314.48] which he's clearly into.
[4314.48 → 4318.56] He likes big buns, and cannot,
[4318.88 → 4319.56] where's the
[4319.56 → 4319.86] where's the
[4319.86 → 4321.62] especially when they're like very,
[4321.62 → 4324.16] stop talking.
[4324.16 → 4326.28] Stop talking.
[4326.44 → 4329.12] We should actually move on now to a different topic.
[4329.26 → 4329.58] Um,
[4329.72 → 4333.64] new egg just announced a trade in program for GPUs.
[4333.76 → 4336.02] I have no idea if it's any good.
[4336.14 → 4339.96] All I did was link it to when show team and say new egg trade in program.
[4340.06 → 4340.58] GPUs.
[4340.60 → 4341.08] I am curious.
[4341.30 → 4343.58] So I'm going to read this now for the first time.
[4343.94 → 4346.44] New eggs trade in program for used graphics cards,
[4346.58 → 4348.24] soft launched earlier this month.
[4348.58 → 4349.06] Um,
[4349.32 → 4351.20] but not officially announced.
[4351.20 → 4353.34] I think now officially announced is what they meant,
[4353.70 → 4353.86] uh,
[4353.86 → 4354.52] how it works.
[4354.92 → 4355.10] Uh,
[4355.12 → 4358.98] new egg first estimates the trade in value of a user's graphics card.
[4359.14 → 4363.60] The lowest estimation is $30 for a four gig,
[4363.64 → 4365.54] Radeon RX 5,500 XT.
[4365.68 → 4371.76] And the highest is $561 for an RTX 3090 Ti.
[4372.88 → 4378.02] Now I'm not an expert on buying used things.
[4379.68 → 4380.08] JK,
[4380.34 → 4381.48] I'm pretty good at it,
[4381.48 → 4384.36] but those do not seem like very good prices.
[4384.68 → 4385.08] This feels,
[4385.12 → 4386.82] this feels like EB game scamming.
[4386.96 → 4387.22] Yeah.
[4387.58 → 4387.82] Yeah,
[4387.82 → 4388.58] it is basically.
[4388.98 → 4391.22] So if you want to be lazy as heck,
[4391.22 → 4394.36] you can just get hosed on the value of your item.
[4394.82 → 4395.58] Hold on a second.
[4395.66 → 4396.28] Hold on a second.
[4396.36 → 4396.80] Let's just.
[4397.16 → 4397.60] Okay.
[4398.54 → 4402.24] So used 3090 Ti's are worth more like,
[4403.06 → 4403.48] okay,
[4403.48 → 4406.12] here's one that went for $800.
[4407.12 → 4409.30] This is as is ignored this one.
[4412.18 → 4412.66] That,
[4412.84 → 4415.80] that what brand new.
[4415.80 → 4416.06] This,
[4416.18 → 4416.38] this,
[4416.70 → 4417.54] what is this?
[4417.66 → 4418.88] Those are Shazam,
[4419.02 → 4419.36] I think.
[4419.70 → 4419.96] Yeah.
[4420.54 → 4420.94] Uh,
[4420.98 → 4421.40] used.
[4421.52 → 4421.76] Okay.
[4421.94 → 4423.80] You didn't even list the gigs right though.
[4423.94 → 4424.26] Come on.
[4424.56 → 4424.92] Come on,
[4424.96 → 4425.10] brother.
[4425.54 → 4427.66] So somewhere in the
[4428.22 → 4429.10] this is an auction.
[4429.20 → 4429.36] Okay.
[4429.36 → 4430.00] Somewhere in,
[4430.08 → 4433.00] I think the 750 to a thousand range.
[4433.70 → 4434.66] There are,
[4434.74 → 4436.90] there are ones that go,
[4437.00 → 4437.16] okay,
[4437.28 → 4437.82] really?
[4438.70 → 4439.14] Wow.
[4439.68 → 4440.08] Okay.
[4440.76 → 4441.06] Well,
[4441.16 → 4442.62] these are clearly not worth.
[4442.66 → 4443.60] So weird to me.
[4443.70 → 4445.96] Quite as much as I thought in some cases,
[4446.50 → 4447.04] but,
[4447.28 → 4449.38] but let's go ahead and back to,
[4449.48 → 4450.36] back to my notes here.
[4450.36 → 4456.02] They are all worth more than $561 by a lot.
[4456.58 → 4457.14] Now,
[4457.30 → 4463.44] I don't think it's fair to necessarily see a low trade in price and say scam.
[4463.98 → 4468.86] There is a value to the service they're providing, and they are doing actual work.
[4469.14 → 4471.32] They have to validate these cards.
[4471.46 → 4473.32] They have to create this program.
[4473.44 → 4475.76] They have to pay the people who administer it.
[4477.10 → 4477.54] However,
[4477.54 → 4479.64] looking at the prices that you just brought up,
[4479.70 → 4481.14] it's actually a lot better than I spent.
[4481.30 → 4481.74] However,
[4482.14 → 4487.86] it's very clear to me that if you wanted to try your hand at the used market,
[4487.86 → 4490.44] you would be able to get more money for your card.
[4490.56 → 4493.62] It's just that as Luke already alluded to,
[4493.74 → 4496.70] not everybody is comfortable with that and not everyone wants to do the work.
[4496.80 → 4496.92] I mean,
[4496.92 → 4505.88] privately selling your vehicle is something that is objectively a way to get way more money for it because it's math,
[4506.00 → 4506.32] right?
[4506.84 → 4510.72] If the dealer is going to sell it for more than what they pay you,
[4510.88 → 4511.96] which they will,
[4512.30 → 4513.62] then you,
[4513.80 → 4515.58] if you could just find that person,
[4515.70 → 4517.06] could sell it for more.
[4517.06 → 4523.70] It's just a matter of whether you want to deal with people flaking you on Facebook marketplace and doing a bunch of paperwork.
[4523.98 → 4524.94] And yeah,
[4524.98 → 4525.76] keep thinking you're done.
[4526.02 → 4526.30] Uh,
[4526.40 → 4528.72] Shelby in float plane chat said six months ago,
[4528.72 → 4530.76] they sold their 30 90 TI,
[4531.08 → 4533.46] which was broken for $700.
[4534.78 → 4535.26] Yeah,
[4535.26 → 4536.46] but that was six months ago.
[4536.96 → 4538.28] That was a very,
[4538.36 → 4539.48] very different market.
[4539.76 → 4539.96] That's,
[4539.96 → 4541.64] I did ask them how long ago it was.
[4541.80 → 4541.90] Yeah.
[4542.02 → 4542.32] Um,
[4543.02 → 4543.28] yeah.
[4543.58 → 4543.98] All right.
[4544.40 → 4544.84] Um,
[4545.12 → 4547.88] after the user buys a new GPU,
[4548.08 → 4548.62] so you also,
[4548.92 → 4551.02] this is another sort of drawback to the program,
[4551.10 → 4552.20] depending on how you see it.
[4552.40 → 4552.62] Uh,
[4552.62 → 4555.12] you do have to buy a new GPU from new egg.
[4555.16 → 4555.84] It's a trade in.
[4555.88 → 4557.40] They don't just buy your old hardware.
[4557.52 → 4558.00] Uh,
[4558.00 → 4564.10] new egg will send a prepaid label to return your old card to them in the next 14 days.
[4564.10 → 4568.98] Once the card is inspected and is found to match the conditions that you reported,
[4568.98 → 4573.04] the value of the card is refunded from the original payment.
[4573.62 → 4579.00] Cards older than the NVIDIA RTX 20 series or the AMD RX 5000 series,
[4579.12 → 4583.74] which were launched in 2018 and 2019 respectively are not eligible for trade.
[4583.80 → 4587.40] And can you believe that RTX 20 series launched in 2018?
[4587.74 → 4589.42] We have gotten in that time,
[4589.52 → 4590.92] in that five years,
[4591.02 → 4592.98] we have gotten two refreshes.
[4594.10 → 4596.76] That's actually pretty wild.
[4597.00 → 4597.08] Wild.
[4597.60 → 4599.20] Users could likely get a better return.
[4599.26 → 4599.50] Oh yeah.
[4599.60 → 4599.74] Okay.
[4599.82 → 4602.64] Users could likely get a better return selling their used graphics card elsewhere,
[4602.64 → 4605.28] but new egg appears to be framing the program as a convenient,
[4605.54 → 4610.18] low hassle way to sell old GPUs rather than as a way to get the best possible price.
[4610.24 → 4610.52] And honestly,
[4610.62 → 4610.88] I was,
[4610.94 → 4612.94] I was expecting to see like 1100,
[4613.06 → 4615.34] 1200 bucks for a lot of the cards that we saw.
[4615.94 → 4616.34] Um,
[4616.34 → 4618.70] the pricing that they're offering is better than I expected.
[4619.24 → 4623.12] Let's have a look at what a GPU is worth to new egg.
[4623.48 → 4623.80] Uh,
[4623.80 → 4624.58] according to new egg,
[4624.64 → 4625.98] they will be refurbishing,
[4626.12 → 4629.76] then selling the used cards with a 30-day warranty.
[4629.76 → 4633.20] So they do intend to make a profit here.
[4633.26 → 4633.58] Honestly,
[4633.78 → 4635.70] I don't know why this took this long.
[4635.90 → 4640.98] I couldn't figure out like knowing that hardware was definitely worth monies.
[4640.98 → 4641.96] When I was at NCI,
[4641.96 → 4646.50] I couldn't figure out why we didn't just play in the used hardware space.
[4646.50 → 4647.92] I can tell you right now,
[4647.92 → 4651.94] they are making more on these than they're making selling brand-new GPUs.
[4652.18 → 4654.08] There's so much more money in used hardware.
[4654.08 → 4655.16] Um,
[4655.16 → 4655.68] so let's hear,
[4655.78 → 4655.92] let's,
[4656.02 → 4656.22] let's,
[4656.34 → 4656.82] let's have a
[4656.90 → 4657.78] let's have a quick look boo.
[4658.20 → 4660.68] Some of these seem pretty out to lunch.
[4660.80 → 4661.08] Um,
[4661.08 → 4666.04] that 3090 TI for $561 is in my opinion,
[4666.04 → 4667.36] not even the most egregious.
[4667.36 → 4671.38] It might be the farthest off in terms of total dollars,
[4671.48 → 4672.32] total dollars,
[4672.32 → 4676.08] but this RTX 2066 gig for $90,
[4676.34 → 4682.82] there is no way that percentage wise that is not way far off.
[4682.86 → 4683.00] Okay.
[4683.00 → 4683.30] What's it?
[4683.32 → 4684.16] What's a 2060.
[4684.52 → 4685.60] And maybe I'm wrong.
[4685.88 → 4686.40] Maybe I'm wrong.
[4686.58 → 4687.84] Using your own arguments.
[4688.02 → 4692.48] They still have to do the same amount of work to refurbish it and inspect it and all that kind of stuff.
[4692.54 → 4692.84] Holy crap.
[4693.08 → 4694.52] 2060s are not worth anything.
[4694.52 → 4697.52] Okay.
[4698.62 → 4698.94] Hold on.
[4698.96 → 4699.26] Hold on.
[4699.30 → 4700.28] Some of these are going for more,
[4700.34 → 4701.68] but like 70 bucks.
[4702.30 → 4702.70] What?
[4703.34 → 4703.54] Oh,
[4703.62 → 4704.50] man,
[4704.58 → 4704.72] I,
[4704.72 → 4704.96] man,
[4704.96 → 4706.10] I take the new egg deal.
[4706.96 → 4708.08] Are you kidding me?
[4708.22 → 4708.54] Yeah.
[4711.04 → 4711.60] What was it?
[4711.64 → 4712.16] Did I say 90?
[4712.22 → 4712.74] Did I say $90?
[4713.00 → 4713.26] I'm sorry.
[4713.32 → 4715.98] I have about the short term memory of a flea.
[4716.24 → 4716.46] 90,
[4716.64 → 4716.86] 90.
[4717.18 → 4717.54] Okay.
[4717.66 → 4718.78] So that's not bad.
[4718.80 → 4719.34] Looking at this,
[4719.44 → 4719.74] honestly,
[4719.84 → 4720.44] actually not that bad.
[4720.48 → 4722.70] I was ready to dunk on this super hard.
[4722.80 → 4723.30] It's really,
[4723.48 → 4724.16] so was I,
[4724.16 → 4724.94] it's not that bad.
[4725.26 → 4727.04] Like if you get top dollar for your card,
[4727.16 → 4727.40] like,
[4727.52 → 4727.80] you know,
[4727.86 → 4728.60] buddy here did.
[4728.72 → 4731.30] But there's a bunch on here that are going for a hundred,
[4731.94 → 4732.78] even 110.
[4733.10 → 4734.52] It also matters a lot.
[4734.52 → 4735.72] If you've got some like,
[4736.30 → 4736.48] oh,
[4736.54 → 4736.72] yes,
[4737.24 → 4739.04] like looking card like this,
[4739.04 → 4740.50] or if you have like,
[4740.58 → 4741.52] yeah,
[4741.52 → 4742.26] yeah.
[4742.26 → 4744.12] And it doesn't look like new egg.
[4744.26 → 4745.34] They don't seem to delineate.
[4745.46 → 4745.60] Yeah.
[4745.84 → 4746.22] Well,
[4746.32 → 4747.42] and I understand why,
[4747.54 → 4749.12] because from a performance standpoint,
[4749.12 → 4750.60] it doesn't matter.
[4750.68 → 4751.80] It would also just be really annoying.
[4751.80 → 4753.54] And new egg knows it doesn't matter.
[4753.78 → 4754.00] Oh,
[4754.16 → 4755.70] that $70 one was parts only.
[4756.22 → 4756.58] Oh,
[4756.64 → 4757.00] was it?
[4757.04 → 4757.22] Okay.
[4757.26 → 4757.54] Hold on.
[4757.58 → 4757.82] Hold on.
[4757.84 → 4758.24] Let me keep,
[4758.24 → 4759.26] let me keep poking at it.
[4759.52 → 4760.24] I still,
[4760.36 → 4762.42] there were quite a few that were quite inexpensive.
[4762.42 → 4763.94] Um,
[4764.94 → 4765.38] here,
[4765.52 → 4765.78] where's,
[4765.86 → 4766.26] uh,
[4766.96 → 4767.26] oh no,
[4767.32 → 4767.46] they're,
[4767.62 → 4769.06] they're mostly over a hundred bucks.
[4769.76 → 4770.86] Parts only the del one.
[4770.94 → 4771.14] Okay.
[4771.26 → 4771.44] Yep.
[4771.50 → 4771.82] You're right.
[4771.88 → 4773.02] They're mostly over a hundred bucks,
[4773.12 → 4776.14] but there are some that are $90 from new egg.
[4776.32 → 4778.88] So if the over a hundred bucks is like 110,
[4779.14 → 4779.82] 120,
[4780.14 → 4780.80] 135,
[4780.80 → 4785.66] a ton of people are going to skip the needing to do anything for 20 or 30 bucks.
[4786.10 → 4788.68] Especially if you factor in what your time is worth.
[4788.68 → 4791.98] I think it's pretty safe to say that if you have never done it before,
[4791.98 → 4796.10] if you have to actually set up an account and like learn,
[4796.10 → 4797.06] uh,
[4797.06 → 4797.32] uh,
[4797.32 → 4797.72] a buy,
[4797.80 → 4799.40] sell trade site or something like that,
[4799.40 → 4802.20] I think it's pretty safe to say fees as well.
[4802.32 → 4804.24] There are ways to get around that.
[4804.36 → 4804.60] Well,
[4804.76 → 4805.24] yeah,
[4805.26 → 4807.18] but as a buyer,
[4807.36 → 4812.80] you shouldn't get around the eBay fees because that's where your buyer protection comes from.
[4813.64 → 4814.12] Yeah.
[4814.16 → 4814.44] Um,
[4814.44 → 4814.64] is,
[4814.68 → 4816.06] is paying through the platform.
[4816.24 → 4816.78] Because you could like,
[4816.82 → 4817.76] isn't Craigslist free?
[4818.34 → 4818.58] Mm hmm.
[4818.82 → 4819.00] Yeah.
[4819.10 → 4820.42] Facebook marketplace is also free.
[4820.52 → 4820.78] Facebook marketplace.
[4821.06 → 4821.90] There are no fees there,
[4821.96 → 4831.58] but you will pay in the time that you will spend just like around messaging random people who flake you or don't show up when they say they will and stuff like that.
[4831.60 → 4831.70] Like,
[4831.72 → 4835.96] I'm not going to pretend that the process of buying and selling stuff online is perfect.
[4836.14 → 4840.46] If I could get $120 for my card, or I could just get a guaranteed 90 bucks through new egg,
[4841.22 → 4843.00] it's pretty likely I'm going to get the guarantee.
[4843.00 → 4843.94] There's no way you would.
[4844.74 → 4845.38] You don't think so?
[4845.62 → 4845.82] You?
[4846.02 → 4846.24] No.
[4846.24 → 4848.58] Yeah,
[4848.58 → 4849.06] maybe not.
[4849.50 → 4849.88] I don't know.
[4849.98 → 4850.12] Yeah.
[4850.26 → 4850.52] No,
[4850.60 → 4850.80] Luke,
[4850.90 → 4851.40] right now,
[4851.52 → 4852.06] right now,
[4852.14 → 4853.98] I will give you $120.
[4854.80 → 4855.16] Hey,
[4855.26 → 4856.36] but you have to,
[4856.42 → 4861.06] you have to sell that water bottle on Facebook marketplace, or I'll give you $90, and you don't bother.
[4861.50 → 4861.68] Yeah,
[4861.72 → 4862.32] I'd sell the water.
[4862.32 → 4863.22] Of course you would.
[4863.36 → 4863.48] Yeah.
[4863.58 → 4863.78] That's,
[4863.86 → 4864.04] no,
[4864.10 → 4864.42] there's no,
[4864.50 → 4866.94] you were speaking nonsense before.
[4867.06 → 4868.18] That was actual nonsense.
[4868.30 → 4868.48] Okay,
[4868.48 → 4869.82] but I think a lot of people would do that.
[4869.88 → 4872.16] I called you so hard and you got wrecked.
[4872.42 → 4875.54] This is the face of a man who was recently wrecked.
[4875.54 → 4878.62] So relaxed about it.
[4880.36 → 4880.64] I just,
[4880.76 → 4880.98] you know,
[4881.02 → 4883.04] when you get caught out sometimes you just got to accept it.
[4883.68 → 4885.36] It is what it is.
[4885.36 → 4891.42] I do,
[4891.46 → 4893.08] I do think a lot of people would do that though.
[4893.54 → 4893.84] Yeah,
[4893.92 → 4894.18] I,
[4894.24 → 4895.40] I was more,
[4895.56 → 4900.00] I was more peeved about it when I thought that the prices were really far off,
[4900.02 → 4902.26] but they seem to be a little less far off than,
[4902.40 → 4902.86] than I thought.
[4902.96 → 4904.52] I'm not logged into Facebook on this computer.
[4904.74 → 4904.90] Yeah.
[4904.98 → 4908.30] So I'm not able to compare to Facebook marketplace right now.
[4908.40 → 4909.28] It's a generally cheaper.
[4909.28 → 4909.50] Oh,
[4909.58 → 4911.74] I totally am logged into Facebook on this computer.
[4911.82 → 4912.96] I must've had to do this before.
[4913.64 → 4913.90] Okay,
[4913.96 → 4914.20] cool.
[4914.20 → 4914.64] Uh,
[4914.64 → 4914.80] which,
[4914.86 → 4915.88] which one should I search first?
[4916.04 → 4917.02] Should I do the 2060?
[4917.12 → 4917.36] Do the
[4917.44 → 4917.54] yeah.
[4917.80 → 4918.04] Okay.
[4918.06 → 4918.98] Let's do the 2060.
[4919.88 → 4920.28] Uh,
[4920.36 → 4921.70] okay.
[4921.74 → 4922.84] This is in Canadian dollars.
[4922.84 → 4925.46] So I'm going to have to do a quick calculative here.
[4926.36 → 4926.72] Um,
[4927.84 → 4929.82] Dan good.
[4929.90 → 4930.06] One,
[4930.10 → 4930.20] two,
[4930.26 → 4931.60] two says I work for PayPal.
[4932.14 → 4934.42] Please don't try to avoid the fee.
[4934.52 → 4938.18] I see so many scans where people ask for personal payments and then screw people over.
[4938.36 → 4939.44] I do agree with that.
[4939.52 → 4940.68] I'm going to take this moment though,
[4940.70 → 4941.32] to say like,
[4941.50 → 4942.24] holy crap,
[4942.30 → 4943.80] working with PayPal is horrible.
[4944.20 → 4944.96] Um,
[4945.12 → 4946.56] and if there's anyone,
[4946.80 → 4948.30] if there's anyone there,
[4948.40 → 4952.42] if you can get me in contact with someone who could actually somehow,
[4952.42 → 4952.92] uh,
[4952.92 → 4954.54] incite some change over there,
[4954.54 → 4956.40] I would love to have a conversation with them.
[4956.88 → 4957.34] Um,
[4957.62 → 4960.54] PayPal is literally the worst vendor that we have to work with,
[4960.54 → 4960.96] uh,
[4960.96 → 4962.46] in regard to financial stuff.
[4962.92 → 4963.40] Um,
[4963.78 → 4965.24] it's actually a nightmare.
[4965.38 → 4971.80] There's also like extremely major security problems with your dashboard in regard to how multi-users,
[4971.80 → 4972.68] um,
[4972.68 → 4976.44] are able to work within it that Dan had to deal with recently,
[4976.44 → 4982.56] where like you could make it so that a user couldn't do certain things and that user could just go in and turn it back on.
[4982.56 → 4983.12] Uh,
[4983.12 → 4983.46] uh,
[4983.46 → 4999.40] and,
[4999.40 → 5000.10] 50 plus dollars,
[5000.24 → 5002.32] depending on the grade of card that it is.
[5002.40 → 5004.54] There's some very optimistic people here.
[5004.68 → 5006.24] That's 250 Canadian dollars.
[5006.38 → 5007.14] That ain't happening.
[5007.32 → 5007.34] Oh,
[5007.34 → 5007.60] you were,
[5007.68 → 5008.90] you were adjusting for USD already.
[5008.90 → 5011.28] That ain't happening with this Dell OEM card.
[5011.28 → 5019.30] but one of the issues with Facebook is that unlike eBay which is an imperfect system to be clear but
[5019.30 → 5025.38] unlike eBay you can't actually see what things sold for so there could be negotiation that's
[5025.38 → 5030.76] going on, and you have no way of checking what a completed listing went for, and it's its hard to
[5030.76 → 5037.88] tell exactly how it's hard to it's hard to tell exactly how close that is to what you would
[5037.88 → 5042.60] actually pay for it like a lot of the times Craigslist Facebook marketplace if you're just
[5042.60 → 5047.78] like hey I am around the corner right now here is literally a picture of the money in my hand it's a
[5047.78 → 5053.96] little bit less than what you asked for, but I will be there in 10 minutes yeah it's amazing when people
[5053.96 → 5060.24] don't need to waste their time how open they are to selling things for a little bit less than what
[5060.24 → 5066.40] they want which is exactly what New egg is going for yeah overall I think this kind of sounds like a
[5066.40 → 5071.32] seems cool to me at least as an option it sounds like an okay it's I think you should check like
[5071.32 → 5079.64] every time yes um, but it's a decent option I think if you have an uh like high-end version
[5079.64 → 5084.62] yeah almost always going to be a lot more worth it if you have some blinded out version
[5084.62 → 5089.12] yeah you should probably try to do some like water cooled card or something like man water cooled
[5089.12 → 5094.50] last gen cards are hard to get rid of yeah it's for that reason that in a lot of cases I would
[5094.50 → 5099.96] actually recommend buying an air cooled card and water blocking it yourself compared to buying a
[5099.96 → 5105.00] water blocked card because I think about the user that's going to buy it you will pay the water block
[5105.00 → 5111.86] premium for the pre-water cooled one, but you won't get an air cooler to put back on the card when it's
[5111.86 → 5120.46] time to sell it and nobody who's building a system that has six hundred dollars worth of pumps and
[5120.46 → 5128.24] blocks and fittings and tubing is buying a last gen card why would they do that if they have money for
[5128.24 → 5135.66] water cooling crap they have money for a current card so it's just it's a very uh very challenging
[5135.66 → 5143.74] situation meanwhile I just bought five last gen water cooled cards so unless you find a
[5143.74 → 5150.80] then you're in trouble I just I wanted to go VGA for the land centre oh yeah EK had a bunch of their
[5150.80 → 5158.04] old 3080 blocks on clearance because that's what happens um and I found a bunch of VGA xc3 3080s
[5158.04 → 5165.04] so our land centre is all VGA all the time and by the way those cards are f***ING rock solid oh yeah
[5165.04 → 5173.98] I ran a 12-hour firm arc last night because are you mad can we talk about cards being
[5173.98 → 5178.98] rock solid are you mad can we talk about cards being rock solid and heart touching or sorry where
[5178.98 → 5188.40] are we going with this no we released our am doh video yeah, and I'm annoyed oh why because I got I
[5188.40 → 5195.06] sent you a message about this I got lines you got line I I I got lines I have no idea what you're
[5195.06 → 5203.22] talking about sucks people watched the first bit of me talking and then just left the video as
[5203.22 → 5208.60] far as I can tell oh okay so it's nothing I did wrong no, no no, no no, no no, no no okay I was like no
[5208.60 → 5212.24] no I reviewed this video I thought it was a perfect video no I thought it was great yeah it's good
[5212.24 → 5220.26] video um the amount of people that are just spamming the hell out of me that uh I've got a
[5220.26 → 5226.00] solution to this one of the problems that you had even when they're trying to be helpful people yeah
[5226.00 → 5231.88] good people yeah trying to be nice yeah I feel like I'm doing the Trump thing the best people
[5231.88 → 5238.72] good people uh no, no like it's its a lot of it is like people genuinely trying to be very helpful
[5238.72 → 5243.70] and positive and stuff but like oh my god I'm getting rocked with people talking about there's
[5243.70 → 5248.60] also people like trying to condemn me for testing it in an unacceptable environment, and I'm like
[5248.60 → 5258.74] it's fine now there there aren't any problems I'm crashing in Starfield very rarely
[5258.74 → 5265.02] and no other game or other scenario ever is crashing or having any issues
[5265.02 → 5275.32] what do you want so for context if you haven't watched the video at all Luke opens his section
[5275.32 → 5282.30] talking about driver instability system crashes performance issues stuttering and then goes on
[5282.30 → 5287.68] to explain that his setup is a little bit unconventional with a PCI Express riser a secondary
[5287.68 → 5293.56] power supply plugged into the card with his primary power supply powering the CPU and drives and everything
[5293.56 → 5299.24] else and so people are latching on to that going user error user error you're doing
[5299.24 → 5304.50] something wrong but the thing that people got to understand is that if they were to finish watching
[5304.50 → 5311.50] the video then they would hear Luke talk about how now with driver updates from AMD that exact same
[5311.50 → 5317.08] system with that exact same PCIe riser and also with an external power supply and everything the same
[5317.08 → 5322.76] as it was before is rock solid and there 's's people in chat talking about
[5322.76 → 5329.02] it right now there's a bunch of Nvidia people crashing and start stars start field it just crashes it's
[5329.02 → 5334.84] not I don't think this is AMD's fault I can't say that it never happened because it did technically
[5334.84 → 5340.86] so I'm trying to be like honest yeah, but I don't think it's the cards fault it's just a game that crashes
[5340.86 → 5347.86] I think that basically what we all need to try to internalize is that AMD is not going to suck your
[5347.86 → 5348.96] yeah
[5348.96 → 5359.10] put that away I feel like I'm a target right now
[5359.10 → 5370.50] but yeah it's its perfect now and one but one bit of context I guess with the way that I said
[5370.50 → 5374.70] things and framed things and I do have to admit this is that was even filmed a few weeks ago at
[5374.70 → 5379.88] this point yeah yeah, and it's probably better by now, but I have even more context we can only talk
[5379.88 → 5385.06] about what happens and that's the thing you guys got to understand is we're not on a team we're not
[5385.06 → 5391.50] on team Intel team AMD team Nvidia we don't give a shit at the end of the day you know the point of
[5391.50 → 5399.50] these switched videos is that we tried it, and we talked about our experience okay, okay okay uh
[5399.50 → 5405.90] NW at in full plane chat said makes no sense to blame AMD for game engine bugs though I didn't
[5405.90 → 5411.26] I literally in the video I say I don't know I think we got someone who didn't watch the video
[5411.26 → 5416.26] yeah I say in the video that like I don't know how to like to say this or frame this, but these don't
[5416.26 → 5422.16] feel like GPU issues I say that in the video yeah because I also can't say I was there when he
[5422.16 → 5428.78] said definitively that it is the game engine no we don't know as I can't say definitively that
[5428.78 → 5434.92] it's not the GPU but what we know is that it doesn't matter yeah at the end of the day if someone's
[5434.92 → 5440.56] coming from a console for example and their expectation is that things just work I mean to
[5440.56 → 5445.66] the extent that they even do just work on consoles these days but anyway if their expectation is that
[5445.66 → 5452.44] it just works then it didn't just work, and we have no way of controlling who someones going to
[5452.44 → 5459.82] blame so whenever an issue does come up our reason for flagging it is hey Bethesda AMD
[5459.82 → 5467.16] you all gotta get together figure out whose fault this is point all your blame fingers that you need to
[5467.16 → 5474.02] point and iron this out because at the end of because it's going to ruin the experience for the user
[5474.02 → 5478.00] and they're going to refund the game, or they're going to refund the card, and you have no way of
[5478.00 → 5483.38] controlling which one they're going to refund so you guys got to work together you got to get it
[5483.38 → 5489.62] sorted out that's that's all we're saying yeah yeah so like I should be a bigger props I think
[5489.62 → 5496.02] almost like we've we've given them their licks over uh the launch experience being bad was terrible
[5496.02 → 5500.30] but I also want to give them very good prompts that it is currently or props sorry that is currently in
[5500.30 → 5505.50] a very good spot and I feel like the reason why I'm frustrated is I think that got brushed over
[5505.50 → 5510.66] because people are still thinking that I have issues I don't have issues it's a great experience
[5510.66 → 5516.26] currently Luke if I had a dollar for every time this is why I said I got Linus I said something in a
[5516.26 → 5522.28] video and then people stopped watching and completely took away the wrong point yeah
[5522.28 → 5526.68] that'll probably be about where I am today
[5526.68 → 5530.28] happens a lot, but I'm doing all right
[5530.28 → 5536.54] wow what a flex
[5536.54 → 5546.02] oh man but yeah that's why yeah anyway I don't know um I gotta wait till he's drinking
[5546.02 → 5552.60] I'm going to get him one of these days I just I can't, I can't, I can't control put it down earlier
[5552.60 → 5557.84] is I could, I wasn't even looking at him, but I could just I could tell he was hungry for it
[5557.84 → 5561.98] so like Dan almost got me when I was about to take a drink then he was like no this is mine, and I was
[5561.98 → 5570.30] like I have to bail out I can't control if it's like an imp it's like an impulse for me that I and I feel
[5570.30 → 5576.30] like this bites me in the butt a lot because I have this type of humour where I will go for the
[5576.30 → 5584.60] driest straightest possible delivery of the most offensive thing I can possibly say in that more the
[5584.60 → 5590.26] most not offensive but the most outlandish thing that I can say possibly say at that moment
[5590.26 → 5597.98] and whether it's people watching a video and tuning out right after I said that or whether it's even in
[5597.98 → 5604.92] person interaction sometimes where people think I am legit for reals serious when I will say this
[5604.92 → 5612.84] kind of stuff I feel like I get bitten by that a lot pretty often it's the easiest thing to pull
[5612.84 → 5617.54] out of context than make well Yvonne's given me well it's its it's the classic I'm not saying Hitler
[5617.54 → 5632.70] was right you know almost got him how do you put up with this man he's all right
[5632.70 → 5644.04] that got me yeah I don't know I I I feel like I do open myself up to it a lot whether it's self
[5644.04 → 5648.88] deprecating humour or whether it's just you know that I will that I will say something ridiculous
[5648.88 → 5658.68] just to see that Yvonne has this face she makes when I say just the most completely offensive just
[5658.68 → 5666.08] like sexist I think I know yeah I'm sure you do because I will especially pull it in like group
[5666.08 → 5673.28] settings and it drives her absolutely nuts um man I forget what it what oh man I did an
[5673.28 → 5678.74] exec meeting recently she was not happy about that I think it was two weeks ago in the staff meeting
[5678.74 → 5684.62] I forget exactly what I said but basically and I've told her I've told her a hundred times
[5684.62 → 5689.94] the only reason I say these things is so you'll make that look make that face and she's just like
[5689.94 → 5697.70] it's involuntary I can't help it I've just like I can't even I can't even do if it's amazing I'm
[5697.70 → 5701.52] going to try and get it on camera sometime now and then I'll bring it on when shall I'll show you guys
[5701.52 → 5705.36] this is the look I'm trying to get Yvonne to make and it's not because I believe any of what
[5705.36 → 5711.78] I'm saying no it's just because it's really, really funny you just got to be careful about the yeah
[5711.78 → 5716.94] the attendees at the moment yeah oh I know right well that's the thing is
[5716.94 → 5723.94] no I because it has to be people that that know that you are you often believe the opposite
[5723.94 → 5729.66] of the thing that you say, so I have it that's basically like trust me bro in a nutshell
[5729.66 → 5738.00] is I make this assumption that nobody could possibly believe that I am like that
[5738.00 → 5742.90] perception that this thing I'm saying would actually be a straight face portrayal of my character
[5742.90 → 5749.42] but people actually do and what I'm trying to do a lot of the time is I'm trying to say something
[5749.42 → 5757.00] that is just ridiculous and what I've what I've what I'm realizing more and more is yes satire is dead
[5757.00 → 5763.52] right like you can't satire on the internet it's just really hard for both parties because there are
[5763.52 → 5768.86] people that will say that stuff with a straight face well that's what I mean and there is
[5768.86 → 5776.28] is there what's the term for that I'm looking it up I'm trying to oh all right sorry but yeah I'm
[5776.28 → 5781.30] it's its like you said like you can't truth is stranger than fiction it's like what the South Park
[5781.30 → 5785.76] writers said they were like yeah we're not even going to try to we're not even going to try to
[5785.76 → 5791.42] parody politics any more we're our well not parody but we're not even going to try and write satire about
[5791.42 → 5798.26] politics anymore because the truth everything's so outlandish that's just like law pose
[5798.26 → 5804.62] law pose law all right and who's POE I don't know but he has a law Edgar Allen by any chance no
[5804.62 → 5812.84] is an adage of internet culture saying that without a clear indicator of the author's intent any parodic
[5812.84 → 5818.68] or sarcastic expression of extreme views can be mistaken by some readers for a sincere expression of those
[5818.68 → 5825.90] views the law is frequently exploited by individuals who share genuine extremist views and when faced
[5825.90 → 5830.38] with overwhelming criticism by using by insisting they were merely being satirical that is true
[5830.38 → 5835.22] I've seen that we've also walked in I had a conversation with uh someone about this recently
[5835.22 → 5840.40] where there's something that you and I have actually said a bunch that I had no idea was like
[5840.40 → 5848.16] a dog whistle for this thing that neither of us oh was it like this or something no okay
[5848.16 → 5852.98] because I found out this is like white power or something I'm like no it just means okay especially
[5852.98 → 5857.92] if you're someone who dives which both of us do yeah that is literally exactly what you're supposed
[5857.92 → 5862.94] to do especially means okay yeah I did it in uh if you do thumbs up when you're diving it means I need
[5862.94 → 5868.06] to ascend now yeah it's good for lighting as well because you're often like a thousand feet away
[5868.06 → 5872.34] and going like this is like you can't really see anything but if you're you get your hand open
[5872.34 → 5880.80] you know yeah it's good the light is good there yeah we are not white supremacists yeah I can say
[5880.80 → 5892.30] that yeah exactly oh man but yeah sometimes it's like oh my god like okay I don't know every single
[5892.30 → 5898.62] cultural reference in like the world I'm not trying to dog whistle this thing that I didn't even know
[5898.62 → 5903.22] was a thing like yeah oh man it's sometimes it's its difficult to navigate I don't know especially
[5903.22 → 5907.80] being in Canada I feel like we end up just kind of like isolated from this stuff fairly sheltered from
[5907.80 → 5917.86] a lot of those things yeah just have absolutely no idea yeah anyway tech topics sponsors let's let's do

[6123.06 → 6130.66] all right time to do some merch messages Dan hit me yeah give me no time in between these segments
[6130.66 → 6135.54] before we do the merch messages um a sponsor policy clarification I talked on the show
[6135.54 → 6142.02] recently about how we don't take supplement sponsorships um or i I said that we hadn't I can't
[6142.02 → 6147.14] remember exactly what I said the point is that we had never done it in the past because I wasn't
[6147.14 → 6153.54] really comfortable with the kinds of brands that we had had reach out in the past um I don't know
[6153.54 → 6161.14] a ton about what I was specifically referring to was like um I don't know what's that store called
[6161.14 → 6166.66] there 's's a local store that just like has all the like weight gain powders and like
[6166.66 → 6171.46] all the like random natural health products I don't everyone knows the name I don't know the name
[6171.46 → 6181.06] because I don't go there uh anyway the point is GNC yeah yeah I think that no, no GNC is the like more
[6181.06 → 6185.46] legit one there's like there's one that has like I think you're right like a raided out guy in their
[6185.46 → 6190.90] marketing materials and stuff anyway the point is it doesn't matter uh Popeyes no not that one
[6191.46 → 6198.74] I know who Popeye is it takes spinach no Popeyes is a supplement I know okay I just mean it's not that
[6198.74 → 6205.30] one I know they sold sandwiches I wouldn't call Popeye a raided out guy okay it doesn't matter the
[6205.30 → 6211.46] point is um oh apparently GNC doesn't sell legit stuff okay so that's my whole point I don't know
[6211.46 → 6216.18] is that I don't know a ton about this stuff but some members of our community so I said look we
[6216.18 → 6220.18] don't work with these guys because there's a ton of money in supplements I was talking specifically
[6220.18 → 6225.54] about snake oil crap supplements um some members of the community have expressed confusion about our
[6225.54 → 6231.06] sponsorship than with athletic greens given my stance on working with supplements and other
[6231.06 → 6236.82] ingestible products to be clear when I talked about ingestible products I was talking about our
[6236.82 → 6243.78] own products we've worked with lots of ingestible sponsors savage jerky um and marinas uh come to
[6243.78 → 6250.74] mind g fuel we worked with a couple of times um and I actually was not super comfortable with the
[6250.74 → 6258.66] product and we're not we don't work with them, but we don't really work with them that it's
[6258.66 → 6264.98] in it's in no man's land some people love the product as far as I can tell nobody has ever um died
[6264.98 → 6274.02] from g fuel so like you know there's that um but we just it's kind of it's and it's in nowhere land um
[6275.22 → 6280.34] so when I talked about ingestible products I meant our own products we haven't created a breakfast cereal
[6280.90 → 6285.06] I had talked a lot about how I had concerns about beast burger for example being a bit of a nightmare
[6285.06 → 6291.38] for Mr beast and a liability issue um so you know that's that's that, but we know we have worked with
[6291.38 → 6296.66] ingestible we just haven't worked with supplement brands and the reason is that I just don't know a
[6296.66 → 6301.94] ton about it and I was not in a position to validate it, and it's not something that I use so i
[6301.94 → 6307.14] wasn't really comfortable with it athletic greens on the other hand we have team members that have used
[6307.14 → 6311.38] products similar and have used their products and based on our experience with them and our current
[6311.38 → 6315.46] knowledge of their product we are open to doing business with them again supplements are not
[6315.46 → 6321.86] actually on our do not work with list on the Linus tech tips.com forum, and they won't be it's going
[6321.86 → 6328.02] to be very case by case, and we are going to approach with caution it's pretty much all I have to say
[6328.02 → 6338.18] about that for now all right you're ready yeah hit me uh this one's for Luke you've spoken about having
[6338.18 → 6344.10] thrifted your way into monitors for your pc before how bad a monitor would you use for free before spending
[6344.10 → 6350.34] money on a better one yourself oh I mean I have pretty good monitors now um yeah Luke traded himself
[6350.34 → 6354.66] to monitors pretty early on in the leg days he bought himself a couple pro arts that was actually
[6354.66 → 6360.10] my first it was after like one of the first paychecks I got from leg was two new pro arts
[6360.10 → 6368.10] um I like having good monitors um I see monitors as kind of um not an investment because you'll certainly
[6368.10 → 6374.74] never get any money back for them, but it is it's a long term literally huge amount of use purchase the
[6374.74 → 6378.74] part of your computer that you will interact with the most yeah hands down more than your mouse more
[6378.74 → 6384.90] than your keyboard more like anything those two pro arts one of them was uh broken not due to its
[6384.90 → 6391.78] own fault but due to I don't blame them it was an emergency situation, but it got whacked pretty hard
[6391.78 → 6397.86] and then now won't turn on um so one of them is now dead but no actually um but the other
[6397.86 → 6405.06] one is still working yeah yeah it's been a decade, and it's still ah it's not a great monitor by
[6405.06 → 6411.46] today's standards yeah, but it's functional, but it's solid it's a great it's a great side monitor yep
[6411.46 → 6419.62] yeah that's what it does and like I was I I think on average monitors are the piece that back when i
[6419.62 → 6425.70] bought all my stuff that I spent the most on yeah I bought a really expensive CPU once yeah the
[6425.70 → 6430.66] Athlon 64 4400 plus that was probably the most expensive single component I bought it was like
[6430.66 → 6436.26] 800 Canadian dollars back when the dollar was a lot closer to parity and that was in like 2004 or
[6436.26 → 6444.90] something when dollars were you know more or whatever inflation um but I also picked up a used uh dell 2405
[6444.90 → 6453.14] few way back around that time treated myself to a view sonic p95 f plus uh that was a sick monitor at the
[6453.14 → 6461.70] time and with both of those intention was that these will last multiple CPU GPU cycles because a
[6461.70 → 6468.26] good monitor is something that should last you a very long time I went from there to a 305t so that
[6468.26 → 6473.86] was a Samsung 30 inch and then I think that's probably the last monitor that I bought so on average
[6473.86 → 6482.90] those were all probably around like 800 Canadian dollars to be clear I got deals on the second two
[6482.90 → 6489.78] the p95 f plus I bought like at NCI or whatever but then the 2405 I bought used and then the um
[6490.50 → 6495.30] the 305t man that was a good deal it was a return from a customer those were like
[6496.34 → 6501.30] fifteen hundred dollars or something like that, and its like was scratched, and we couldn't return it to the
[6501.30 → 6505.86] supplier, but it wasn't scratched on the screen and then like the RMA department tested it and they
[6505.86 → 6510.34] were like yeah I don't think this thing works and I was like I'm pretty sure I can get it to work i
[6510.34 → 6514.50] didn't think there was anything wrong with it, and so I was like I'll make you an offer and I got it for
[6514.50 → 6518.74] like 900 bucks or something like that, and it like totally worked it was perfect flawless I don't know
[6518.74 → 6524.26] what anyone was even talking about my girlfriend um is currently running a triple monitor setup
[6525.22 → 6530.82] she's studying for some stuff and whatnot so she actually fully utilizes the triple monitor screen
[6530.82 → 6537.30] real estate, and she's using an old view sonic that I won in one of the like old Christmas parties
[6537.30 → 6544.18] a while ago um and one of the other ones I don't remember where one of her monitors is from, but she's
[6544.18 → 6548.98] got the old view sonic one that I don't remember where it's from and then another one which is mine
[6548.98 → 6556.34] that I bought when I was like 15 or something and that thing still works that monitor that she's using
[6556.34 → 6563.30] has been at every single residence that I have ever lived at Luke is there any reason not to have
[6563.30 → 6571.06] a secondary monitor no this is so this is what I was talking about you can get old like 1080p screens
[6571.06 → 6576.82] for like 20 bucks i that that one that I'm talking about that I bought when I was like 15 bought it off
[6576.82 → 6582.18] of whatever I think it was Craigslist at the time whatever used thing at the time for I think it was ten
[6582.18 → 6592.02] dollars yeah like, and it still works, and it's still deployed it turns on every day
[6593.06 → 6598.02] like that thing's a beast it's an old LG monitor from a while ago uh it still has
[6599.06 → 6605.70] the resolution is high enough that it's usable for a secondary monitor or whatever 1680 by 1050 and over
[6605.70 → 6614.42] is very usable yeah yeah, and it's just like sweet yeah we both run triple monitor setups and like if i
[6614.42 → 6620.26] was if I was back in school or whatever right now looking at those prices we just saw on screen I would
[6620.26 → 6628.98] have a triple monitor setup because why not because the the the floor for used monitor prices is so much
[6628.98 → 6635.78] lower than the floor for a new monitor with all the logistics involved in you know mining new materials
[6635.78 → 6640.74] and creating it and shipping it across oceans and like all that crap that's associated with there's
[6640.74 → 6646.66] just there's only so low something can go its why hard drives don't get any cheaper than what they are
[6646.66 → 6653.38] now they actually can't the motors and the magnets like they just they don't get cheaper but used hard
[6653.38 → 6661.06] drives not that I would necessarily recommend using those used hard drives are worth nothing
[6665.06 → 6670.10] 10 bucks oh man people actually are pretty optimistic about what their hard drives are worth
[6670.82 → 6679.54] never mind hard drives are worth more than I thought um what i last time I looked into use SSD prices it was
[6679.54 → 6685.94] literally more expensive to buy used ones um I don't know what's up with the I don't know what's up
[6685.94 → 6691.30] with the used market and storage it's kind of weird sometimes yeah it's its much more worthless to me well you
[6691.30 → 6698.02] know what it is uh people who build budget systems and then sell them for you know a hundred bucks or
[6698.02 → 6704.10] whatever they need hard drives they need just anything that can hold an OS yeah yeah
[6704.10 → 6710.58] you're also not sorting right someone said I don't know whatever um what was I going to say
[6711.22 → 6717.54] someone said something oh no I don't remember what you say is objectively true someone said something
[6717.54 → 6722.82] that is certainly oh yeah yeah yeah no it's like if you're is you're is you're like into gaming and
[6722.82 → 6726.74] you want a good gaming monitor or whatever so you spend a bunch of your budgets there I still think you
[6726.74 → 6733.54] can get to a two or even three monitor setup um you don't have to do it immediately and just keep
[6733.54 → 6738.10] looking out for deals and your monitors don't have to match grab some yeah none of my I have three
[6738.10 → 6743.78] different monitors my girlfriend three different monitors it's cool when they match when I had those
[6743.78 → 6748.26] two pro arts I had two matching monitors, and it was awesome yeah, but it hasn't made a lot of sense
[6748.26 → 6756.66] since then to get matching monitors so whatever yeah do you want to talk about speaking of monitors
[6756.66 → 6762.50] Samsung odyssey neo g9's cracking yeah I was just talking about how they last for a long time and all
[6762.50 → 6767.30] this kind of stuff oh yeah we only did one word oh what was even the question that was a very good
[6767.30 → 6773.54] segue though Linus what was even the question i tried to do so I tried to do so good uh do you
[6773.54 → 6781.06] remember it uh what would cause me to buy a monitor oh yeah uh well yeah I don't know hopefully that sort
[6781.06 → 6789.78] of answers where am I uh okay here's another you're in unit 101 oh okay you're in Coverdale oh maybe
[6789.78 → 6798.50] it's the dale of clovers oh that's one of all of our computers are named weird um hey DLL first
[6798.50 → 6805.22] merch purchase from a rare apple podcast listener I've been considering moving my side hustle to full
[6805.22 → 6812.90] time I do a variety of consulting has Ltd ever used consultants or contractors of course contractors
[6812.90 → 6821.38] yeah every time we hire a lawyer we are hiring a consultant slash contractor, and it happens more
[6821.38 → 6827.54] often than you'd think it's amazing how many little stupid things you have to pay someone 400 an hour
[6827.54 → 6832.90] because they're the only people who know about that and to be clear i I fully support people being paid
[6832.90 → 6838.18] for their expertise it's more than just time it's your you are paying for the time that they spent
[6838.18 → 6843.94] becoming a subject-matter expert totally get it um that doesn't mean that I don't notice
[6845.38 → 6852.58] when we write the check though so you'd be amazed it happens a lot um what are some other examples of
[6853.22 → 6861.06] contractors and consultants uh a decent amount of the uh developers for flow plane or contractors
[6861.06 → 6866.50] yeah jams hired someone to come and do like improve classes on site at some point to kind of help the
[6866.50 → 6872.26] writers that's cool understand you know hosting better and you know what the kind of energy
[6872.26 → 6878.58] you need for you have spontaneous we have people come in to do work around the offices all the time
[6878.58 → 6884.26] install the ac stuff like that yeah our uh I don't think that's really what they're referencing but
[6884.26 → 6888.26] if you guys have ever watched the office tour back when we were at the Langley house
[6888.98 → 6894.74] and noticed how filthy that place was we have cleaners now they're contractors yeah yeah we have a
[6894.74 → 6901.06] company that comes in and just you know gives it the old dustaroonie and vacuum Rooney um just
[6901.70 → 6906.42] because the theory was that we could just do that once in a while and people would mostly keep the
[6906.42 → 6912.82] workspace clean yeah they won't so we just they come in I think every week now they didn't use to have
[6912.82 → 6918.02] to it was every two weeks for a long time and as we've grown, and you just have all these
[6918.82 → 6923.94] people and people are gross, and they drag in all their dirt on their shoes, and they shed all their skin
[6923.94 → 6929.46] cells and their hair, and it's just you got like in this building how many people work in this building
[6929.46 → 6933.94] like fewer now yeah because we're distributed a little bit more but still probably like a solid
[6933.94 → 6940.18] 30 to 40 or something like that and then the lab has like man where is everybody yeah hold on a second
[6940.18 → 6947.22] we have like 120 total people including contractors yeah so a solid amount of them are remote but yeah how
[6947.22 → 6951.78] how many of them are how many of them are how i I don't know how many work in these buildings
[6953.46 → 6960.50] create a warehouse is like dense stuffed d-e-n-s-s yeah i i I gave a tour recently to
[6960.50 → 6966.18] know they're going to need to move Sam and I was walking through just going like whoa it's taken's problem
[6966.74 → 6974.18] yeah I want nothing to do with it if he decides you know hey Linus and Yvonne you guys need to
[6974.18 → 6980.50] buy something because the extensive renovations we need are justified it or if he's like
[6981.46 → 6986.74] well that'll take some time not right now, but you know if we need to save up or something but if he's
[6986.74 → 6991.94] like okay we need to lease something I'm just like okay taken whatever we're going to do but yeah whatever
[6991.94 → 6996.50] you say is right I still think you should do the cult thing there be a lot of us makers of merch yeah
[6996.50 → 7003.86] TNA is talking about it, but it's its actually wild in there they like it's logically laid out
[7003.86 → 7009.94] yeah but like I don't think they can hire all that many more people where are you going to put them
[7009.94 → 7016.42] there are a couple spots maybe there's maybe they can work there's six over with um kyle's team
[7016.42 → 7022.34] which uh I mean Tynan's the one watching so Tynan's team is which is like 25 of the building yep
[7022.34 → 7026.42] yep and then uh over in design so we've got
[7032.90 → 7038.82] oh, oh goodness customer care to hold on I was already up to 13 there and I hadn't even counted
[7038.82 → 7047.86] well man i I think wow and then fashion is like six now or something like that okay so that's where a
[7047.86 → 7051.22] lot of them are because I was trying to i was trying to i was trying to come up with a number
[7051.22 → 7055.38] for this building I was like it's got to be like 30 to 40, but it's like no, no actually hold on a second
[7055.38 → 7060.26] because that that creator is definitely the 25 30 people out of all the buildings work there
[7060.26 → 7064.98] and to be clear you know the engineers aren't always packed in there and the fashion and design teams
[7064.98 → 7070.34] are not well the design doesn't get to get out there's not free-range design I guess they don't get to get
[7070.34 → 7084.02] out much but give them like a yard this this this shirt was free-range design
[7085.78 → 7093.22] no one at this company touches grass yeah we should fix that ethically sourced clothing
[7093.22 → 7101.94] I think from Linus detective if we don't if we don't do a hand on grass shirt
[7103.06 → 7109.46] free-range design like if that's not in Sarah's inbox in the next 30 seconds here we've clearly
[7109.46 → 7119.38] done something wrong oh my goodness I'm on it oh man was this was the were the buns ethically designed
[7119.38 → 7124.50] Linus did those designers have adequate grass time I don't know
[7130.18 → 7134.26] oh man it's uh it's certainly grown a long time since we put that building together
[7135.06 → 7146.10] because when we originally did the plans we had kyle and Tynan and another one and then nice
[7146.10 → 7154.02] real nice yeah I think Jacob I think the like apartment area was just not really used and
[7154.02 → 7158.18] then they worked out of the downstairs right yeah they were downstairs in the kind of garage area and
[7158.18 → 7164.74] the upstairs was kind of the communal lunchroom and storage, and then we had uh design team which was
[7164.74 → 7173.70] maybe three or five people totally, and we'll get the other one fixed soon don't worry
[7176.98 → 7180.82] and then yeah what does the fashion team was like four people as well
[7182.82 → 7185.30] it was empty yeah not anymore no
[7187.38 → 7192.58] so we're going to have to buy like an another suite of buildings is your phone just busted I'm trying to send
[7192.58 → 7199.46] this email that my Gmail does not want me to have this shirt doesn't yeah know this is ridiculous
[7200.26 → 7205.78] okay close compose okay can I if is it even in my draft did this even save free-range design shirt
[7206.42 → 7213.46] oh crap wait did this send while you're doing that uh this merch message came from someone who
[7213.46 → 7220.66] said they were a rare apple podcast listener is that rare that made me think of uh google is killing
[7220.66 → 7224.74] another thing yeah you did a perfect segue, but we actually still have to do one more merch message
[7224.74 → 7230.42] no I know but I don't think this is a topic is if it is oh never mind you just got talk about it later
[7230.42 → 7231.94] you just got talk blocked
[7239.14 → 7242.82] I don't know if your mic is open for other people you just hear Dan sigh
[7242.82 → 7253.62] do you want another merch message yeah, yeah sure send it uh I don't see I can't even remember which
[7253.62 → 7260.58] one I was going to read now uh okay let's see hey there DLL as a software developer who has worked in
[7260.58 → 7265.54] both smaller startups and enterprise environments how do you address technical debt in your projects
[7265.54 → 7273.06] how do you prioritize it while Linus tries to figure out how to make us more money how to send an email
[7273.06 → 7276.98] like boomer moment I don't want to die um technical debt uh
[7279.78 → 7287.70] you're essentially always going to have it um so you kind of have to triage to a certain degree you can't
[7287.70 → 7293.46] just only ever do that uh yeah Jaden we don't like to talk about that subject yeah that's honestly pretty fair
[7293.46 → 7297.38] um yeah you can't ignore it forever
[7299.70 → 7304.66] that got us into a bad spot we used to do what I could try that we used to do what I used to refer
[7304.66 → 7311.86] to as Linus lead development uh and that was very bad that was terrible that dug us into a hole
[7311.86 → 7319.54] that we're kind of still clawing out of let's be fair to Linus for a moment here um the lights are on
[7319.54 → 7324.66] everyone is still gainfully employed yeah I would just I would just like to acknowledge
[7325.62 → 7331.54] acknowledge the positive points of Linus lead development now you can go ahead and proceed to
[7331.54 → 7338.02] crap all over it Jaden says in float plane chat LLD led to a lot of tech debt yeah Linus lead development
[7338.02 → 7343.94] it was that was a problem eventually I just ended up just saying no to everything all the time and then we
[7343.94 → 7349.62] delivered no new features for like a year yeah and then I know I didn't say it's a problem because
[7350.34 → 7353.78] why are you so defensive right now because look how defensive he is my life
[7360.42 → 7364.98] so can't send his email during Linus lead development we dug ourselves really, really deep
[7364.98 → 7370.90] so it took a really, really long time to dig ourselves back out and even now we're not completely out but
[7370.90 → 7375.30] we're in a way healthier spot than we were in before, and now we're at a spot where we can kind
[7375.30 → 7380.66] of spend we can spend a little bit of time working on features and then okay tech debt is an always
[7380.66 → 7385.54] growing thing, and we just spent some time working on features when we already had a lot of tech debt
[7385.54 → 7390.10] so like going into the next quarter jade and I have already been talking about it a lot of Jaden's work
[7390.10 → 7395.14] is going to be um working on paying down tech debt, but he's going to do it in kind of cool way
[7395.14 → 7401.06] where like um for example there's a certain page that needs to be uh tech debt removed, but he's also
[7401.06 → 7405.30] going to deploy a new design at the same time and like to do a couple other things so it still feels like
[7405.30 → 7410.90] the website is getting uh is becoming more fresh and being worked on even though we're paying
[7410.90 → 7415.70] down tech debt at the same time so you kind of try to yeah I don't know how to really answer this but
[7415.70 → 7420.58] you can't completely ignore it, but you also can't spend a hundred percent of your time working on it
[7420.58 → 7424.58] yeah so you fight it you kind of have to like okay we need to give people a feature or else
[7424.58 → 7428.74] they're going to be pissed off so let's do that really quick that has bought us some time that
[7428.74 → 7434.50] has bought us some users are satisfied time let's use these users are satisfied time to pay down some
[7434.50 → 7439.62] tech debt and then try to slot in another new thing that they'll be happy about um before they get too
[7439.62 → 7444.74] disgruntled and then you just kind of try to keep doing that ch5609 says I want a Linus lead
[7444.74 → 7453.14] development t-shirt it's just a garbage fire now that's not fair floatplane.com was not a garbage fire
[7453.78 → 7454.98] you couldn't tell what it was
[7460.58 → 7463.94] and it had no smell at all the pixels were very clean
[7465.94 → 7471.14] it was an it was a chaotic time because he'd be like hey uh what about this crazy feature and I'd be
[7471.14 → 7475.54] like sure let's do that and then like a week later he'd be like so where is it and I'd be like
[7476.66 → 7481.46] hey verify actual gamer program hey that was actually that was awesome that was post
[7481.46 → 7486.90] Linus led development was that oh okay yeah, yeah maybe I can't remember when it started and ended yeah
[7486.90 → 7491.62] it was definitely something I asked for, and it was super cool and the team like crushed it on that I've
[7491.62 → 7498.02] I've been crapping on them so now to throw them a bone at the very end of it yeah I will say
[7498.02 → 7503.06] it's kind of my fault yeah I'm the leader of the team that's not what I was expecting I should have
[7503.06 → 7507.86] stayed but I like it, I should have staved off the line of sled development more but I was just like
[7507.86 → 7513.62] I don't know hold on you were the leader of the team right okay so than sorry who was leading
[7513.62 → 7522.66] the development exactly which l this l right here boom l yeah pretty much so yeah tell your if you're
[7522.66 → 7526.42] in that spot just tell your boss no more often and then if you get fired I'm sorry
[7532.34 → 7539.38] career advice because like if you do is you just listen and just try to get your team to do
[7539.38 → 7545.06] that you're going to screw them over because you're going to end up digging your team into tech debt and
[7545.06 → 7550.98] then ultimately like yeah you were trying to listen to your boss, but you were doing the wrong thing so i
[7550.98 → 7556.26] had to at some point i had to take the reins a bit um and I don't know it's been getting better
[7557.22 → 7562.90] all right let's talk about odyssey neo g9's cracking there's been an emerging pattern of
[7562.90 → 7571.78] odyssey neo g9 owners reporting their 49 inch 5k ultra-wide monitors spontaneously cracking down the
[7571.78 → 7579.70] middle between a day and 11 months after purchase while user error is a chance the descriptions of
[7579.70 → 7585.06] the failures were remarkably similar several independent sources claim they were playing a
[7585.06 → 7590.58] game not touching the screen only to hear a loud pop and for a large crack to appear in the centre
[7590.58 → 7595.62] of the screen accompanied by a large black vertical band other users claimed to have turned off the
[7595.62 → 7599.94] monitor and left only to return after hearing a loud pop in the other room and returning to find
[7599.94 → 7605.46] their monitor broken some users with fully functional monitors also claim to have heard odd popping
[7605.46 → 7610.82] noises in the moments or hours after turning off their monitor which they suggest might be a sing of
[7610.82 → 7617.06] heat stress while a few users reported that Samsung promptly honoured their warranty many others reported
[7617.06 → 7624.26] that Samsung has refused to address the damage while still under warranty one user claimed they spent over
[7624.26 → 7630.82] 20 hours on the phone and opened six different tickets only for customer support to cancel each one for
[7630.82 → 7637.78] specious reasons that's not a word I normally use so I'm not super familiar with it, but hopefully it was used
[7637.78 → 7644.18] correctly spurious is that what we were looking for I don't know another said that Samsung claimed that it was
[7644.18 → 7648.66] physical damage and not under warranty based on the photos without actually examining the device
[7648.66 → 7653.30] superficially plausible but actually wrong oh cool I like it good word
[7653.30 → 7661.94] wonderful uh okay it is possible that a user's region is affecting their support status but this
[7661.94 → 7667.70] is really hard to verify as we don't know most of the affected users locations however the only users who
[7667.70 → 7675.30] both disclosed their location and received support were located in the U.S. the only users who both
[7675.30 → 7681.70] disclosed their location and did not receive support were located outside the U.S. a Canadian user who
[7681.70 → 7686.50] contacted us managed to get a response from Samsung support, but he is at the time of writing waiting
[7686.50 → 7692.42] for the support team to review and get back to him, we've contacted Samsung asking for an explanation
[7692.42 → 7698.42] but we haven't had a clear answer so far Samsung opened pre-orders for the 8k 57 inch version of the
[7698.42 → 7706.82] odyssey neo g9 last week at 2500 I feel like we might have dodged a bullet here because we actually
[7706.82 → 7714.10] were going to do a sponsored video with Samsung for the neo g9 the new one um, and maybe it's uh
[7715.78 → 7722.34] better we didn't you know I'm surprised we haven't seen this more often with these crazy ultra wides
[7723.22 → 7728.98] that's a good point actually because like this is pretty much the only one I know of I don't really
[7728.98 → 7734.66] follow ultra wides much, so there might be more but like literally the whole time I've been like you
[7734.66 → 7740.58] know the physics of this there's a lot of I mean well part of it is that the panel technology
[7740.58 → 7746.50] is not okay it's not just I haven't reached for my phone I don't have a fold it's not just folding
[7746.50 → 7751.70] phones that have flexible panel technology in them a lot of the time there 's's flexible panel
[7751.70 → 7757.54] technology like an OLED is relatively flexible compared to older display types um and just because
[7757.54 → 7763.62] it's on a fixed you know stretched across a fixed canvas or whatever doesn't mean that it isn't a
[7763.62 → 7768.98] a little flexible, but it's just any anytime you have something that's like really what I can't fit
[7768.98 → 7774.02] both my arms yeah frame but anything that's really wide well just the leverage assume this hand is way
[7774.02 → 7779.30] further out, and then it's only held in the single point the forces on the furthest outsides is gonna
[7779.30 → 7786.26] be really high yeah so like I don't know yeah I'm a little surprised for me the bigger issue is one
[7786.26 → 7793.14] that I've encountered a lot the difference in support from region to region I have never been
[7793.14 → 7796.34] able to wrap my head around a company
[7798.74 → 7806.98] somehow justifying to itself and to its users that if you buy an item in one region and try to
[7806.98 → 7813.94] get warranty support on it in another region or whatever I've never been able to wrap my head
[7813.94 → 7822.18] around um any rationale for that being anything other than simple and i I get the accounting of
[7822.18 → 7827.14] it is complicated if you get back a broken product and send out a new product you have to
[7827.14 → 7832.82] reconcile that somehow that shows up on your PNL or whatever else, but headquarters needs to just
[7833.70 → 7840.74] suck it up and reconcile it for you like I don't otherwise that that reflects really poorly on your
[7840.74 → 7848.82] brand, and you suck uh i just i I don't get it um, and it's something that we've seen time and time and
[7848.82 → 7855.94] time again I don't care it's its not my problem that you guys don't have a service centre here I will
[7855.94 → 7861.22] happily ship it to wherever your service centre is, but you do need to honour the warranty does it have
[7861.22 → 7868.34] does it have your name on it or not okay then you need to fix it um and I mean obviously I'm not
[7868.34 → 7874.58] talking about counterfeit products here I'm talking about ones that are not counterfeitable like i uh
[7874.58 → 7879.30] i I've talked about this before and I want to give kudos to valve for the way that they've handled the
[7879.30 → 7884.74] couple of issues that I've had with my index um but my initial conversations with them were very
[7884.74 → 7890.90] frustrating because I wasn't in a region that was yet authorized to buy the index, and so I had a hard
[7890.90 → 7894.82] time explaining how I got one and I had a hard time getting warranty service for it, I remember
[7894.82 → 7900.10] that yeah, and you know from my point of view you don't need proof of purchase because this product
[7900.10 → 7905.06] hasn't even been out long enough for it to have run out of warranty, so none of this is relevant just
[7905.06 → 7911.78] take the shipment and send me a new one like it's not it's not complicated at that point uh but in their
[7911.78 → 7916.34] system it is and so it's a systemic problem it's not because the customer service agent hates you and
[7916.34 → 7921.54] doesn't want to help you it's because they just haven't put the work into eliminating these
[7921.54 → 7932.34] roadblocks for customers it's frustrating yeah it's frustrating oh you know what's frustrating
[7932.34 → 7937.62] just a second oh i expensive freaking monitor just to have it like pop in front of your eyes
[7937.62 → 7944.82] it kind of sucks okay i I don't mind bothering like supervisors and managers and like you know
[7944.82 → 7950.50] execs but i I generally try not to bother anyone else outside ours but I'm very
[7951.46 → 7955.14] excited to tell you guys this and so hopefully no oh shoot that's the wrong one
[7956.10 → 7960.34] or wait no yes I could get the answer here wait okay what's happening
[7960.34 → 7971.22] I am so sorry to bother you on a Friday night um but I figured you might be someone I'm on the
[7971.22 → 7975.30] wan show right now you're not on speaker though so if you know you need to tell me off for disrupting your
[7975.94 → 7983.86] dinner or yeah get them late breakfast or whatever it is um did she finish shooting the thing
[7983.86 → 7994.02] okay this is very vague okay cool um okay all right I'm going to leak it then
[7995.94 → 7997.22] we see you later
[8000.10 → 8008.50] we literally just talked about okay bye have a wonderful weekend a topic on this show what was that
[8008.50 → 8015.86] merch message yeah a topic on this show was about things that employees don't like hearing on wan show at
[8015.86 → 8025.62] least it's not Tynan this time what one of those leaks' no it's fine it's good oh man so guess who's going to be back
[8026.18 → 8035.22] on LTT um Adam's so Shea who you guys may remember from his AMD ultimate tech upgrade which was
[8035.22 → 8045.22] hilarious perfect uh yeah really great and this time around oh man i forget her alias but
[8045.22 → 8058.50] she is our secret chopper awesome yeah very good I'm so excited we um she as you guys know just has a
[8058.50 → 8065.14] great personality she gives exactly zero f***s whatsoever about computers so she's an
[8065.14 → 8071.22] ideal secret shopper for us because she can carry on a conversation and be super positive and
[8071.22 → 8078.18] charismatic and fun um, but she has no idea what you're talking about and doesn't care and that is
[8078.74 → 8083.94] exactly what we want for secret shopper we want people to be we want the customer service and sales
[8083.94 → 8088.98] and technical support people to be talking to a personable human being we don't want them to like
[8088.98 → 8094.74] hate us or anything, but we want them to really have to work for it because no this is not someone
[8094.74 → 8101.30] who knows the speeds and feeds and i's and dozens and all those numbers and doesn't care about
[8101.30 → 8109.06] them you have to put it in real human terms and so uh from what I've seen so far which is the sales calls
[8109.06 → 8116.90] Shea has done an outstanding job I am super, super pleased with uh with our selection of our secret
[8116.90 → 8123.62] shopper this time around and now that we are finished the sales calls and the tech support calls
[8124.66 → 8132.82] the system integrators will know that uh storms are coming looking up, but it's too late for them to do
[8132.82 → 8139.30] anything about it databases shea let's know who was it yeah too late for them to do anything about
[8139.30 → 8149.38] it so uh i i i I will say this it's going to be an extremely fun secret shopper series and do you know
[8149.38 → 8155.86] what our theme was so the first time around we did magnum ti tech investigator uh and so it was sort of
[8155.86 → 8163.14] themed after that uh iconic show from I don't even know the 70s I guess um second time around we did
[8163.14 → 8169.94] bond obviously um so it's you know it's always an investigative you know detective secret agent or
[8169.94 → 8180.82] whatever kind of theme PAW Patrol no I have no wow no heavens' no um any guesses come on Dan do you
[8180.82 → 8189.94] know okay if you guys have any guesses I'm I'm open to uh, uh let's let the chat look not Columbo not get
[8189.94 → 8195.94] smart um not Walker Texas Ranger not maverick not angel I don't watch not rockward not Rockford
[8195.94 → 8202.34] files not knives out wow not Sherlock you guys are not there yet not Brooklyn 99 not Sherlock is kind
[8202.34 → 8211.86] of surprising not mash not CSI severance Patman 27's got if it's monk oh you don't know monk
[8211.86 → 8218.02] what do you mean I don't watch shows I don't monk is amazing where on earth did that come from uh I have
[8218.02 → 8225.46] to confess that uh Jacob from the linked team had something to do with it that's uh that's a very
[8225.46 → 8230.90] interesting idea yeah we've gone I would have never considered that in like a bazillion years we've got
[8230.90 → 8237.30] we went with monk it's eight seasons oh it's popular it's a great show it's uh it's actually
[8237.30 → 8243.46] perfect is it an actual monk or is the person's last name his last name is monk is bonded a real bond
[8243.46 → 8250.50] yeah is he glue is it about financial bonds financial advice and martinis this is not financial
[8250.50 → 8256.66] advice we're not financial advisors especially not him uh hell no oh god cappuccino
[8256.66 → 8266.02] anyway yes uh, uh i will be playing I will be parodying the role of Emmy award-winning
[8266.02 → 8271.62] actor tony shallow as monk and uh it's gonna it's going to be a lot of fun we've got all the same
[8272.26 → 8279.22] suspects as last time are all the same um the usual suspects uh, but we've added
[8279.22 → 8288.50] I don't believe cyber power I think was included but DNF'd both the previous times because they
[8288.50 → 8297.62] didn't provide advice they are in this time um, and then we also added everyone's favourite influencer pc brand
[8297.62 → 8311.62] well am I supposed to guess the people will guess it yes Mr big britches star forge
[8312.98 → 8321.14] oh I guess it's been that long because it would have made sense, but it's been
[8321.14 → 8327.86] four years now or something star forge no, no no, no not star forge oh since we've done
[8327.86 → 8332.42] yeah it's been a minute I feel like it's been a long time it's been a really long time
[8334.34 → 8338.82] because I didn't remember what ones were in the first one yeah I mean the first one Ivan did
[8339.78 → 8344.02] so that gives you some idea how long ago that was there's been one since then though right yeah
[8344.02 → 8350.98] December 2018 was the first one and then uh two years ago round two was two years after it was November
[8350.98 → 8357.54] 2020 was round two, so this is round three of secret shopper pretty much three years ago pretty much
[8357.54 → 8363.30] three years ago yep it's the kind of thing ever since we started our goal was to do it every year
[8363.30 → 8366.50] and ever since we started that has never happened
[8369.38 → 8377.06] it's a ton of work but this time around it was not nearly as onerous on the writing team so we had labs
[8377.06 → 8383.78] to help support us through the testing which oh shout out labs yeah enormously helpful which really
[8383.78 → 8388.98] gave proof an opportunity to focus on your know kind of fun intro skits the uh
[8391.06 → 8396.66] okay it's so bad but I hope that it's so bad it's good because it's the first thing you're going to see
[8396.66 → 8406.50] when you click this video the monk uh theme song is a randy Newman song like it's a jungle out there
[8406.50 → 8412.90] you know do you know that song no okay anyway um it's randy Newman so that should be pretty much
[8412.90 → 8420.02] all you need to know yeah yeah yeah so proof wrote parody lyrics and David sang it doing his
[8420.02 → 8429.70] the best randy Newman it's f***ING awful we got more ladies' music yeah it's its really it's the best kind
[8429.70 → 8434.42] of awful and I hope you guys enjoy it a lot we should sell the song as a download on the forum
[8435.46 → 8443.38] yeah yeah I'm kidding I don't even know if the um I'm kidding oh Emily what Emily since when do you
[8443.38 → 8448.66] watch the show Emily she's watched for a while has she I never see you in the chat I do oh okay all
[8448.66 → 8456.34] right um anyway so Emily said and from our editing team i I was looking over her shoulder um because that's
[8456.34 → 8461.62] not weird right you know when you work in a hallway and just you know this chief vision officer just
[8461.62 → 8466.10] walks past and is just looking over your shoulder you have to look at things yeah I have to how
[8466.10 → 8471.06] can I be how can you have vision if you don't anyway i I looked over her shoulder while she was
[8471.06 → 8475.86] working on it, and it looked very funny and then i think she actually uh I think she sent it to
[8475.86 → 8482.74] me for like my proper review I review intros actually I've been reviewing all the video all with
[8482.74 → 8486.34] asterisk I've missed a couple but I've been reviewing most of the videos in their entirety lately
[8486.90 → 8495.30] um the team nailed it whole team nailed it uh it's terrible, and it's great I'm excited i
[8495.30 → 8500.18] don't know I really like the secret shoppers I've liked all of them but I don't know if I'm more
[8500.18 → 8506.42] excited about secret chopper or that we have another musical piece from the company oh man i
[8506.42 → 8511.78] this might not be the one you were after which means it's probably the one that I'm after yeah
[8514.50 → 8523.30] jeez I'm excited it should be good next topic yeah this is a headline Emily says you don't want
[8523.30 → 8529.86] this one that's perfect coming from her okay that's perfect thanks ed, and you got my back
[8529.86 → 8535.78] here right that's exactly what I want though um oh speaking of Samsung displays sorry I'm bringing it
[8535.78 → 8544.42] back to those uh crack crackable displays remember the wall yeah okay remember how I wanted one but
[8544.42 → 8552.18] then it was like a lot of money, and then you talked me out of it oh no this is his this is what this is
[8552.18 → 8556.74] what he says before he says that he's getting one just in case anyone is wondering why I reacted that
[8556.74 → 8561.62] way can you chill am I wrong can you chill am I wrong how about your chill for a second can you just let
[8561.62 → 8566.10] me finish yeah okay remember how I was really excited about them, and then they were stupid
[8566.10 → 8570.74] expensive with all these complications in the installation I would need dedicated air conditioning
[8570.74 → 8575.46] for that room just to handle the heat output yeah the whole thing right okay so then i ultimately
[8575.46 → 8582.10] didn't get one because it was stupid didn't and that can you stop I'm trying to talk here okay i really
[8582.10 → 8587.14] feel like on this show it's always you just going on and on and on I never get to get a word in it
[8587.14 → 8592.58] which one nope not doing that okay that was an example of that thing okay the thing that I said
[8592.58 → 8597.22] was clearly the opposite of what is reality okay so I was talking about this earlier on the show how
[8597.22 → 8602.26] people will hear me say a thing like that and if I don't do the slash s they actually think that i
[8602.26 → 8607.62] think Luke does all the time no I know that's the whole point that's the joke anyway um okay so I wasn't
[8607.62 → 8615.94] going to get one and then did I tell you that Samsung was potentially um potentially willing to work with
[8615.94 → 8623.30] us on one I don't I I don't know the exact details of the arrangement i i I wouldn't get into them now
[8623.30 → 8630.74] I think I heard something about it but anyway um we're not, and it doesn't matter it's I'm not blaming
[8630.74 → 8636.02] anyone it just doesn't matter the point is uh we're not anything's happening but I don't care
[8638.10 → 8650.98] because I found something oh yeah did you know that TCL makes a 115-inch quantum dot mini LED TV
[8650.98 → 8663.86] no that is five diagonal inches smaller than the freaking projector screen in my
[8663.86 → 8669.94] theatre room right now that's crazy that is flipping wild and get this remember how much is it remember
[8669.94 → 8676.66] how hold just can you calm down for a second okay remember how the wall was hundreds of thousands of
[8676.66 → 8685.46] dollars it's come down a lot it's a couple of hundred grand now this TCL TV is 15k which is a freaking ton
[8685.46 → 8691.78] of money for a TV but compared to the wall it's a lot less than I was expecting, and it's non-modular
[8691.78 → 8694.42] so you're not going to get any seams it dies all at once
[8697.06 → 8706.58] I bought one of course it's china only so importing it is going to be an absolute cluster bomb you can't
[8706.58 → 8713.14] say someone full plan should I said quit being so practical you can't say it's its a 15 000 TV
[8713.70 → 8723.38] yeah but I can, it's 115-inch TV at that okay I will defend my right to scoff at a 15 000 TV it's 115
[8723.38 → 8730.58] inches though Luke it is freaking projector size, and it's less than one-tenth the cost of the wall
[8731.38 → 8736.98] I hate that it has the in the name any product with the in the name is terrible although any product
[8736.98 → 8741.78] where you are not allowed to say the like iPhone is also terrible I should be allowed to use
[8742.66 → 8747.54] the word the however I want we need a need a remember how everything was one for a while there
[8747.54 → 8751.22] yeah we need the one we need a product that's just called the one
[8751.22 → 8764.90] oh man uh the wall all in 146 inch is now uh but where's the price for this yeah 200 200 grand
[8764.90 → 8770.82] this is less than one tenth the price I have no idea how you would mount something like this surely
[8770.82 → 8778.50] it can't be a standard vase amount like i the thing weighs I think it weighs about 200 pounds oh
[8778.50 → 8786.18] yeah it's almost exactly 15 000 Canadian it's 80 000 uh Chinese won yeah uh hold on let me see if
[8786.18 → 8791.62] I can get the let me see if I can get the weight uh display specifications.com where do you have uh
[8791.62 → 8800.82] do you have TCL site up no um okay where oh man how do I even how do I even find this 4k 5000 nits
[8802.66 → 8802.98] train
[8805.22 → 8811.06] can't even find it the closest thing that comes up here is like we've got articles about it and then
[8811.06 → 8816.66] yeah an air conditioner like they really do not want me to learn about this thing anyway the
[8816.66 → 8821.86] point is um I want to make I want to make a video about it, I want to know a couple of things I want
[8821.86 → 8828.26] to know okay is the projector effectively dead because even that projection setup is about half the
[8828.26 → 8833.94] price of this TV that is a five six thousand dollar projector on like a couple of thousand dollar screen
[8833.94 → 8838.82] so it's not like it's not like oh yeah this is a fifteen thousand dollar TV it's totally beyond the
[8838.82 → 8843.94] realm like if you want a display that big you are spending a lot of money one way or another
[8843.94 → 8850.42] whether it's half the price though yeah it's a lot of savings it's half the price for a sixth of
[8850.42 → 8856.98] the brightness though like the expectation still in terms still at that range that's that's a lot i
[8856.98 → 8863.62] could I I don't think projector is dead if that's the case no but remember to that TVs more than
[8863.62 → 8873.38] probably anything else have Moore's laud the crap out of everything else yeah what gets predictably
[8873.38 → 8882.50] cheaper and bigger like a TV yeah not much nothing it's actually been quite crazy to follow right so
[8882.50 → 8887.86] you look back at you look back at the rise of SSDs and hard drive manufacturers are going no it'll
[8887.86 → 8895.22] never get there lore Moore's law makes fools of us all i I know i if this thing is actually viable
[8895.22 → 8902.34] like if it's sorry I want to I'm trying to find specs and i just LTT screwdriver add LTT screwdriver
[8902.34 → 8912.42] nice I have one if this thing arrives in one piece looks good is somewhat reasonable to deploy in some
[8912.42 → 8920.34] way man I know i I think the writing could be on the wall for projectors what are you looking at
[8920.34 → 8928.58] I'm trying to figure out what's happening here yeah no it's 100 kilograms yes that is correct
[8928.58 → 8933.30] oh I thought you were trying to look up what weight it is oh i now that i I thought it was 200 pounds
[8933.30 → 8938.66] and it is yes now that I have a number yes it's its 200 pounds yeah so like with that vase amount
[8938.66 → 8945.46] yeah I know right um how thin is it that's like over 200 pounds i I don't know I don't know that's
[8945.46 → 8951.70] not even like as thin as modern TVs which it kind of looks like it, I don't know if it's quite as
[8951.70 → 8957.78] thin as some of them but it looks quite thin overall I'm looking at this picture I mean that could be
[8957.78 → 8962.74] deceptive that is quite far off the wall also I couldn't help noticing it is not wall mounted
[8962.74 → 8971.46] it is sitting on a dedicated shelf dedicated fully dedicated oh boy this could be interesting
[8971.46 → 8978.42] because like if it weighs that much and it's and it's I don't know how realistic this is
[8978.42 → 8984.34] you feel the people oh you can't there you go it's also not 3d this is some very
[8985.62 → 8992.58] abstract marketing not non-literal marketing oh man what is the 20 000 plus what is it
[8992.58 → 8999.86] 20 000 plus of dollars no, no actually i I don't know by the time we pay all the import fees yes but
[8999.86 → 9006.26] um no I don't think that's what that is I'm not sure 157 that could be a dynamic contrast ratio or
[9006.26 → 9012.50] something like that yeah I could see that a plus I know that it does something like 2 000 nits
[9012.50 → 9019.14] peak brightness though I thought I said five did I say five no I don't think so I'm pretty sure it's
[9019.14 → 9027.86] like 2 000 nits peak brightness 20 000 mini LEDs oh well no it does say it does say 5 000 plus nits
[9027.86 → 9034.18] on there am I blind where is it oh here it is yeah good gravy, so this is 10 10 times the peak brightness
[9034.18 → 9042.26] so I have a theory as to why this is china only and I think it's energy star I don't think there's i
[9042.26 → 9047.86] don't think there's any reason that they couldn't ship this to North America or sell this in north
[9047.86 → 9055.78] America or Europe or whatever the case may be other than that I don't think they would be able to so we
[9055.78 → 9062.74] we've seen a big one of the big limiters for TV brightness before the OLED era where I mean really
[9062.74 → 9068.74] it was about maintaining the panels over the longer term one of the big limiters for TV brightness
[9068.74 → 9075.78] was how much power they're allowed to draw, and so I think that these modular systems like the
[9075.78 → 9081.14] wall might be able to get around it because each module doesn't exceed if it's also classified as
[9081.14 → 9087.70] a commercial display now that I think about it the wall is on Samsung commercial which might be how they
[9087.70 → 9094.98] get around the energy requirements, but this is clearly a consumer electronics product and what I suspect
[9094.98 → 9104.98] is that it draws way I mean 5 000 even if you just had a light, and it wasn't a TV, and it did anywhere
[9104.98 → 9110.82] near 5 000 nits on any part of it, and it was that big it would consume an inordinate amount of power
[9113.62 → 9121.86] no 240 watts is definitely not the power consumption of the TV it is going to be top gear 1224 it's
[9121.86 → 9128.02] definitely not 600 watts either this thing is going to be an absolute monster for power consumption i
[9128.02 → 9136.02] mean we had um uh we I think just the audio is 240 watts I think people are confused because it says
[9136.02 → 9143.14] it has a total output power of so right here it has a total power output of 240 watts including 240 watt
[9143.14 → 9149.06] subwoofers but if you read the pre-sentences the audio department is represented by this sound system
[9149.06 → 9154.18] it's just around it's just talking about the audio it's not talking about the TV as a whole
[9154.18 → 9158.58] that is wild no I don't think they're going to talk about power consumption I couldn't find any
[9158.58 → 9162.66] reference to it anywhere yeah because I don't think they want to talk about it, I don't think that's a
[9162.66 → 9170.42] I don't think that's a chip as they call them in the biz um like we just did a video we shot the
[9170.42 → 9175.78] next compensator that's that's Luke's brainchild yeah I saw it did you see it do you like it, I walked past
[9175.78 → 9182.34] it I was like I immediately know what this is and yeah it's great yeah yeah i I appreciate it weighs
[9182.34 → 9190.74] almost as much as this TV yeah it's really heavy all combined it is like close um anyway the monitor
[9190.74 → 9197.62] is not nearly this big I think it's 49 or 55 inches or something like that and that monitor draws 250
[9197.62 → 9205.62] watts this thing is four times the size at least and probably brighter and yeah it's ridiculous
[9205.62 → 9211.62] I think it does high refresh rate like it says somewhere I think it's 144 or something let me try
[9211.62 → 9220.74] to find it again 144 hertz oh man now I want one I know right I know uh you guys are killing me
[9220.74 → 9229.14] I shouldn't have spent all that time painting my wall I just put a TV on yeah right anyway i uh
[9229.14 → 9237.54] it's kind of like the transparent TV for me this is just kind of unique tech that is not going to
[9237.54 → 9241.78] make its way into the western world it won't be covered by western media other than to just be like
[9241.78 → 9249.70] yeah this is a thing that exists, and we will put it through the paces i i am very excited to try it
[9249.70 → 9257.14] out I've just I've never seen anything like it, I had no idea it existed and i um and as an alternative
[9257.14 → 9263.70] as an alternative to something like the wall it I mean one tenth the price it's smaller, but it's
[9263.70 → 9270.34] one tenth the price them are some feet them are some big feet hopefully you're not stuck with
[9270.34 → 9275.70] those they literally put them on mountains just to I don't even know if they're like their scale
[9276.10 → 9278.26] considering the other images on here I don't even know if they're real
[9280.50 → 9285.86] but that's a that's a big foot say that much apparently the specs say 600 watts average so that was
[9285.86 → 9295.62] correct i i I will be very surprised 600 watts average yeah what does that even mean yeah are they
[9295.62 → 9303.14] averaging when it's like basically off and when it's you know full HDR right so yeah it's not going to be
[9303.14 → 9308.42] it's not going to be full white all the time though right I mean but I don't know depends you're gonna
[9308.42 → 9313.86] be watching the empire strikes back yeah what if a flash bang goes off yeah exactly yeah power spikes what
[9313.86 → 9322.10] if you're playing counterstrike 2 on your new 144 hertz insanely huge monitors what if I did what are you
[9322.10 → 9333.54] going to do about it yeah yeah boom got him yeah more like got him sorry speaking of god this came across
[9333.54 → 9341.62] my news feed and I was like what operation zeroes a USA-based company that sells zero-day exploits
[9341.62 → 9349.38] is offering to pay researchers up to 20 million dollars for hacking tools that would allow its
[9349.38 → 9357.14] customers to hack iPhones and android devices previously it was offering only 200 000 for
[9357.14 → 9362.66] exploits for those platforms according to the operation zero Twitter account the increased payout is in
[9362.66 → 9369.46] response to high market demand, but it is also likely a reflection of the difficulty of hacking iOS and
[9369.46 → 9374.18] android devices when we're talking about the kind of hack that would be worth 20 million dollars we're
[9374.18 → 9380.02] talking something that would require no user intervention and would be completely transparent
[9380.02 → 9388.26] to the user so um at the end of their announcement operation zero specifies as always the end user is a
[9388.26 → 9394.42] nominate country so these are governments that are seeking these tools not individuals on their
[9394.42 → 9399.22] official website they state our clients are Russian private and government organizations only okay
[9399.22 → 9405.54] apparently some private ones when asked why their CEO responded no reasons other than obvious ones
[9408.34 → 9411.86] can I just say that that is just about the most Russian response to anything
[9413.86 → 9422.18] yeah kind of I wonder um hmm I didn't actually read the bit about uh it's for the Russians or whatever
[9422.18 → 9431.46] part of me had like this weird somewhat dubious theory that somebody had a zero-day and wanted a lot of
[9431.46 → 9438.18] money for it so they were like let's put out a bounty to try to get more money from some bounty program
[9438.18 → 9439.46] that like apple actually has
[9441.70 → 9449.06] hmm I don't know because uh those bounty programs do exist and I know that the market for bringing them to
[9449.06 → 9455.46] guys like this the market price lucrative it's much more lucrative because they these guys
[9455.46 → 9461.30] know that they have to bid against apple and Google's own bounty programs yeah our discussion question here
[9461.86 → 9467.46] is pretty much does the price increase indicate good things about the state of android and Apple security
[9468.02 → 9470.18] yeah it kind of seems that way I mean
[9471.30 → 9473.94] obviously I think that the paranoid among us
[9473.94 → 9479.38] the justifiably paranoid among us do tend to treat our phones like they're pretty much always
[9479.38 → 9486.26] listening and pretty much always watching but is it possible that that is not as much the case anymore
[9490.02 → 9494.98] like you're not going to spend 20 million dollars on an exploit to spy on you no offence
[9497.06 → 9501.86] you might be putting out a broad spy program so I wonder you might get caught in the crossfire I don't
[9501.86 → 9507.46] know I don't know that you could jump to saying that that's potentially not the case any more uh because
[9509.38 → 9516.50] yeah i think bradyboy26 info plan chat is on to what I'm saying or going to be saying um
[9516.50 → 9521.06] which is that type of data collection it might just not be available to these people
[9522.34 → 9528.26] so they still need their own access to whatever it might be grabbing sure that makes sense um
[9528.26 → 9533.14] um and our other discussion question is what does it mean that the primary clients for these kinds of
[9533.14 → 9540.58] services are governments ah I mean I guess I think the answers to that are only the obvious ones I guess it
[9540.58 → 9545.62] means that google and apple are not cooperating
[9545.62 → 9556.98] too much because they definitely cooperate a little at least not with the ones that are trying
[9556.98 → 9561.14] to buy this yeah that's fair enough uh they could be cooperating plenty with the others
[9562.50 → 9567.30] which makes them kind of the arbiters of who should have this information this whole topic
[9567.30 → 9573.62] makes me extremely uncomfortable which is why I brought it up um i just i have to be honest with you
[9573.62 → 9584.18] I didn't really and maybe this is just naivety i I didn't really think that zero day no user intervention
[9584.18 → 9590.42] I remotely accessed your phone and I have control over it at this point i didn't think it was very common
[9590.42 → 9596.50] today I don't think it is I think that's all the reason why it's worth so much fair enough speaking of
[9597.30 → 9604.50] Reddit karma for cash anyone yeah karma for cash Reddit has announced that users will be able to
[9604.50 → 9610.74] earn money based on the amount of karma and gold they receive on eligible posts i.e. posts that don't
[9610.74 → 9617.62] include content that is sexually explicit or related to violence drugs firearms gambling scams or donations
[9617.62 → 9625.94] to charity unlike twitter's contribution monetization scheme the new Reddit contributor program will not
[9625.94 → 9632.18] require Redditors to be subscribed to a paid membership however they will have to be an U.S. resident over the
[9632.18 → 9639.78] age of 18 with an account in good standing the program will also involve a phase out of the current
[9639.78 → 9646.98] Reddit gold feature which will be replaced with uh by one where users buy gold and then hold the upvote
[9646.98 → 9656.74] button for additional time in order to give that post a golden upvote wow that's horrible what hate the
[9656.74 → 9661.30] user experience of that that sounds really dumb
[9663.70 → 9670.98] moving on uh the uh Reddit phased out Reddit coins earlier this month and when asked why they didn't
[9670.98 → 9676.82] transfer the coins to be used in the new system a spokesperson responded that the existence of both
[9676.82 → 9683.22] paid, and free coins made it complicated to do so they decided to start over completely does that
[9683.22 → 9689.70] mean that everyone with paid stuff just lost it no, no the with free coins lost it oh okay
[9689.70 → 9695.62] in other news Reddit will also no longer be allowing users to opt out of having their Reddit activity used
[9695.62 → 9702.90] for personalizing ads except in select countries which are not yet specified, and they do this stuff
[9702.90 → 9707.70] knowing that no one will ever leave uh because if they were going to leave they had a big reason to
[9707.70 → 9716.02] recently uh and didn't I added that bit that wasn't in the doc yeah so Reddit hates us
[9718.34 → 9723.14] or at least they like money yeah I mean those two things aren't mutually exclusive
[9725.62 → 9733.86] this is cool though this is actually quite cool like seriously I think i I think this was either
[9733.86 → 9737.86] on the Subreddit or the forum or somewhere, but someone was joking we bullied Mark Zuckerberg so
[9737.86 → 9743.38] much about the first metaverse that he made something good like the whole of everyone did to be completely
[9743.38 → 9749.70] honest um and it kind of deserved it, but it doesn't anymore because holy crap that's actually amazing
[9749.70 → 9757.94] yeah this is so it's really so what you guys are looking at is um chief meta Mark Zuckerberg
[9758.74 → 9767.14] the scan that is being created in real time of his face and the avatar the reconstruction of his face
[9767.14 → 9774.02] based on this scan and in motion it's pretty impressive I don't think that scan is real time I would act
[9774.02 → 9779.62] check that quickly oh hold on I believe they went to a special thing and had the laser scan done and then
[9779.62 → 9785.54] the mask is simply updating the model using a lower quality oh sorry you know what yeah no I think
[9785.54 → 9790.34] you're right I should have actually uh I should have actually bothered to read the uh the notes on
[9790.34 → 9798.02] it is sorry not real time not real time but the real time mapping of it is really cool um either way
[9798.02 → 9803.14] once you're sitting there talking and stuff yes yeah so it's not the actual scan in real time some
[9803.14 → 9807.70] people are saying it was handyman is saying it was connected to a pc running a 4090
[9807.70 → 9817.86] sure, but that doesn't have that wouldn't change anything about the fact that it is super cool yeah like i if
[9817.86 → 9823.62] you told me hey that's just kind of a low res video of Mark Zuckerberg and I wasn't looking that closely
[9823.62 → 9832.82] at it, I'd be I'd be I'd be pretty impressed yeah the eyes are kind of dead but I mean its Mark Zuckerberg
[9832.82 → 9842.18] yeah maybe it's good maybe it's accurate yeah, so there's an interview uh between Mark Zuckerberg and
[9842.18 → 9848.98] lex Friedman um I've got it up on my computer right now but uh to not do a reaction video you should
[9848.98 → 9853.94] probably go watch it yourself um but i I'm not listening to it, I'm just kind of skipping through
[9853.94 → 9858.10] it right now looking at different video segments, and it's pretty crazy
[9858.10 → 9865.14] right here I'll, I'll give you guys at least you guys should go watch this wow wait i actually
[9865.14 → 9872.10] can't tell is that cooler mark looks somewhat recreated but jump to 7 42
[9876.34 → 9879.70] is that recreated lex yep whoa
[9879.70 → 9890.26] wow so yeah you guys gotta go watch this wow lexes was more convincing in my opinion
[9891.22 → 9895.62] wow that's pretty wild I heard a lot of people saying that Mark Zuckerberg looks more real now
[9896.74 → 9903.30] oh my god all right I've dumped this into all the various chats that's very impressive yeah it's
[9903.30 → 9909.06] it's really cool uh and there's people there's people in the chat saying you know this is just
[9909.70 → 9914.02] you know whatever mapping, and it's been around forever, and it's like yeah yeah right
[9914.02 → 9922.18] right but here it is really working being used for like video chat um and the
[9922.18 → 9928.98] major benefit of this is that apparently it is way more efficient to transfer the scan
[9929.78 → 9935.22] one time and then just transfer the metadata that's required so when you're like connecting to the call
[9935.22 → 9942.26] it does a download compared to actually streaming video to each other yeah because honestly super
[9942.26 → 9947.62] cool the biggest issue with remote work I think is the loss of body language it's in meetings and
[9947.62 → 9955.22] situations it's anemosis but not complete yeah did this kind of die or are those still a thing like
[9955.22 → 9960.42] the anemosis are I don't know were those cool for 10 minutes or were they are they still cool
[9961.06 → 9965.54] let us know in the chat yeah you need to talk to elijah you're a boomer are our anemosis
[9965.54 → 9971.70] still a thing oh no he's an android loser wow i forgot boomer yeah exactly right
[9971.70 → 9976.74] I keep seeing these numbers out of the states he's not a boomer he's a Kumar 85 percent
[9977.54 → 9984.50] I don't know it's the needs to fill his tank um I keep seeing these numbers like 85 percent of U.S.
[9984.50 → 9990.66] teens have iPhones I'm sitting here going really why yeah I don't know I stayed a symbol
[9991.22 → 9998.66] those green bubbles it's not a status symbol you can get an iPhone for like 60 one bay you can get
[9998.66 → 10003.30] that blue bubble or whatever colour the blue is the good colour right I don't know green blue yeah like
[10003.30 → 10010.34] I don't think blues I don't know I actually don't get it I don't know uh what did Elijah say hey we're
[10010.34 → 10016.50] full buddies yeah well we were man until I mine spilled in the drink mine spilled in the drink
[10017.06 → 10023.14] really you said a Luke sentence it's not a status symbol I'm sorry it's just not
[10024.10 → 10026.02] it's a consumer electronics device
[10028.10 → 10032.02] I think Luke and I were talking about this earlier oh what were you guys saying I'd love to hear it
[10032.82 → 10037.94] I don't think it was earlier today um but yeah it's just confusing I don't get it
[10037.94 → 10043.06] mm-hmm doesn't make any sense to me, I don't understand how it's a status symbol i just
[10043.06 → 10046.98] it's a phone it's the funny thing is like we complain about how expensive apple phones are
[10046.98 → 10049.30] they're not even the most expensive phones yeah
[10051.54 → 10055.86] and like I'm not saying we shouldn't complain about it, I should use it as like a reverse filter
[10055.86 → 10059.38] like if someone filters you out because you don't have an iPhone good
[10059.38 → 10069.78] you probably don't want to be with them, they sound dumb Luke with the hot f***ING takes wow okay
[10070.66 → 10075.14] so he's talking about they just helped you dodge a bullet yeah apparently it's a thing like if you have
[10075.14 → 10079.38] dating if you're yeah if you're pictured with an android device in your dating profile
[10080.02 → 10085.30] people will just you get less swipe you whichever is the bad direction, but maybe you just got higher
[10085.30 → 10091.94] quality ones fewer quantity higher quality so what you're saying is if you want more tinder matches
[10091.94 → 10096.58] you get like five or six iPhones you just cover yourself you make a shout out of iPhones and just
[10096.58 → 10102.26] fan yourself with iPhones it's like pea cocking but with iPhones exactly yeah that is now
[10103.54 → 10108.34] is now the play but like what a stupid thing to be like I can't date this person they have an android
[10108.34 → 10113.70] like that's actually just dumb okay I mean and like let's flip it around if you're an android person
[10113.70 → 10117.38] you're like I can't date that person they have an iPhone that's dumb well how would you communicate
[10117.38 → 10125.70] with them if they don't have I message some people actually think this way Luke email it's just dumb
[10126.26 → 10134.74] it's dumb i i I know people in my actual real life that use yahoo for their email
[10136.74 → 10141.94] that's pretty dumb I'm not gonna not engage with them, I'm going to tell them that that's weird and they
[10141.94 → 10147.62] should probably stop I mean that's not as bad as having your ISP email account that is worse that
[10147.62 → 10156.26] is objectively worse yeah ah hmm would I filter based on that maybe oh I'm wondering now oh if I was on
[10156.26 → 10162.18] the dating scene and someone emailed yeah my email is like uh you know cat lover one two three five
[10162.18 → 10172.34] at Shaw dot ca I might actually be like yikes I'm not I'm wondering now I'm not 100 certain but I think
[10172.34 → 10180.82] maybe tell us dot net I feel like if it was that if I didn't just swipe no if I was swiping I feel like
[10180.82 → 10186.02] i one of the first topics of conversation would be that and I would like to need us to hit a resolution
[10186.02 → 10193.78] like no you need to update that like that's actually okay fine is there an email domain that you would
[10193.78 → 10205.06] prefer so let's let's say gmail.com is your baseline okay and at telus.net is sort of your your your
[10205.06 → 10211.46] negative 10 okay what's your what's your what's your plus five what's your plus 10 domain I don't know hit me
[10211.46 → 10216.58] I want to know where you'd rank Hotmail I'd Hotmail's fine because it's just outlook now
[10217.22 → 10220.98] it just means you've had your email for a long time okay proton mail
[10222.82 → 10225.86] I don't rank it I don't think that would be better yeah I'm thinking I'm thinking
[10226.66 → 10231.06] depends so is this are we specifically talking about dating yeah we're specifically talking about
[10231.06 → 10235.38] dating don't look at chat I want your honest I want I think proton mail is low it's low okay
[10235.38 → 10238.50] where it feels like you're trying to hide something okay give me a number give me a number it's
[10238.50 → 10242.82] definitely above ISP yeah okay give me come on give me a number how do i how do i what it was
[10242.82 → 10249.38] sorry what is the scale how do I number this okay minus 10 is at telus.net okay zero is at gmail.com
[10249.38 → 10255.22] okay uh like minus four you don't you don't want to see that proton there 's's there's
[10255.22 → 10262.82] a weird level of anonymity I've got more I've got more for you so uh okay um at their name.com
[10262.82 → 10269.38] I think that's cool, but it depends on the reason and why and I would legitimately look at it, I would
[10269.38 → 10274.10] go to the domain, but there's nothing on the domain they just bought it because they wanted their email
[10274.10 → 10279.94] to be I think that's cool okay i think this one's fairly variable though uh because like give
[10279.94 → 10286.02] me a range i I think it's anywhere remembered this is dating yeah yeah yeah I think it's anywhere from like
[10286.02 → 10292.66] plus so okay it's its a 20 point scale negative 10 positive 10 yeah I think that's anywhere from
[10292.66 → 10299.54] like depends what it's used for plus two to like plus eight okay um at post-secondary
[10299.54 → 10309.62] institution dot EDU or whatever no really yeah so you're not into the whole like um you know i I'm a
[10309.62 → 10315.14] graduate i know people that do this too so i this is about to get spicy I'm going to get called
[10315.14 → 10321.46] out I think it depends because some of them you lose access to when you leave it and some of them
[10321.46 → 10327.06] you gain you have access to it forever the ones I'm aware of are lifetime access like I know SFU
[10327.06 → 10331.94] do I know some that are not lifetime really oh okay I didn't know that so I think it somewhat depends
[10331.94 → 10333.94] um
[10336.50 → 10338.34] I'm pretty neutral on that one
[10341.30 → 10344.26] I think I'm going to say minus one really yeah
[10345.46 → 10350.82] I thought that was going to be like a good thing no, no no, no no, no no I just changed my mind on it
[10350.82 → 10355.54] not because your reaction I'm going to say plus two it's still low I'm still pretty neutral so it's
[10355.54 → 10361.70] better than gmail.com I think so I think so the dot EDU I think so ah because I was thinking
[10361.70 → 10366.02] like you're just kind of giving all your data to this school and then I was like yeah, but you are
[10366.02 → 10371.70] with Gmail and yeah sure of course you are so like which one's better and probably this one by a little
[10371.70 → 10376.34] bit but I don't really care so yeah let's say plus two honestly for me if I was going to go in I'm kind
[10376.34 → 10383.54] of all over this one um I would say if it's going to be in the negative range it would be if it might be an
[10383.54 → 10389.06] indicator to me that you're the kind of person who looks down I feel like it's I feel like it would be
[10389.06 → 10396.02] worse if it was from a particularly prestigious school really yeah okay so the fact that you feel
[10396.02 → 10402.34] like you have to lead with yes that I have this domain yeah to you is kind of it could have a
[10402.34 → 10407.38] pompous sort of vibe yes which would be bad but I feel like if it was someone where like you
[10407.38 → 10413.70] suddenly have to use this email Bradshaw college.ca or something i I don't know that one might even
[10413.70 → 10420.34] weird because it's like I think this one's like quite the range too I think um but yeah if it seems
[10420.34 → 10425.46] like it was out of like utility if you're like I had to use this for school anyway and I was just
[10425.46 → 10430.98] using it and I just like whatever if that's the vibe I get out of it then cool whatever sounds good okay
[10430.98 → 10438.74] at icloud.com I don't know enough I don't think I care zero I think I consider that same as like Gmail
[10438.74 → 10445.78] really okay, okay yeah interesting Elijah says LMAO check your email privilege by the way um I think
[10445.78 → 10452.98] it just in response to what I was saying about like the the the uh hoity-toity latest domains um
[10452.98 → 10459.30] let me just see if there's any other fun ones okay just what about if it's just like a completely
[10459.30 → 10464.98] ridiculous one so they've obviously set up a custom domain for their email it's not particularly short it's
[10464.98 → 10470.50] not a time saver it's just I think it again it just strongly depends and I think this one probably
[10470.50 → 10476.90] out of all of them could be quite the range uh because if it's like humorous in a good way
[10476.90 → 10484.50] I think it could rank pretty highly but if it's just like stupid like i I used to have an email at uh
[10484.50 → 10492.02] what was if it's like not sharing my dot info or something and if they gave me that email as their
[10492.02 → 10496.74] contact I'd be like okay that's a negative what if they bought what if they bought themselves like
[10496.74 → 10503.94] an at triple x domain or something like that it depends is it humorous like lol dot triple x
[10503.94 → 10507.86] or you know whatever like just something stupid that could be funny I think that all right yeah okay so
[10507.86 → 10513.06] you know it yeah it depends a bit all right okay, okay ah this was a fun game I enjoyed it um
[10513.86 → 10519.30] do you were there any that you notably disagree about people are saying you need to rank AOL yeah that's low
[10519.30 → 10525.38] yeah yeah I didn't even give them all I don't know where that one was going to fall yeah um I don't I
[10525.38 → 10529.86] don't I honestly don't know it's hard for me to talk about dating because it's been a thousand years
[10529.86 → 10535.86] since I've dated me too and i never but i never even dated online at all I never tried it i basically
[10535.86 → 10542.10] didn't okay basically didn't is really different no I totally did I take that back I literally forgot i
[10542.10 → 10548.74] did okay so I hated it I haven't I haven't touched it I have its sucks I have no idea my first impressions of
[10548.74 → 10557.38] at nasa.com plus 10 yeah okay plus 10 my my my um okay I didn't include any corporate ones that's
[10557.38 → 10560.74] totally yeah, yeah anyway and the corporate one really depends as well they're all they're all
[10560.74 → 10565.94] there's a huge range yeah my uh my first impressions of people that I dated were like
[10565.94 → 10571.70] seeing them in class or at camp like it's like it's its just a completely different
[10572.50 → 10576.58] paradigm like I can't even email is a funny one too because like no one gives you their email
[10576.58 → 10582.34] I mean okay there's a there's another thing guys let us know in the comments like do that
[10582.34 → 10588.90] would you yeah would you rank someone up or down based purely on the fact that they provided
[10588.90 → 10596.18] you email as a contact method I think email's bad like I'm pretty sure email's like boomer now I think
[10596.18 → 10601.06] so you are correct yeah like you get somebody's email when you've been married to them
[10601.06 → 10609.62] yeah for maybe like two years like i uh i i I love email because I don't have to deal with it
[10609.62 → 10615.22] right away I can, you're out of touch nobody emails that's what we're saying that come on
[10615.22 → 10620.66] no it's the most professional form of communication you got instant messaging where you know you have
[10620.66 → 10624.98] casual chats you have text messages which is like I need your attention right now this is important
[10624.98 → 10629.78] then you have email which is like I'm going to send you banking details I hate text I hate that
[10629.78 → 10634.98] people still use text because nobody texted me for like years, and then we set up all of our uh
[10634.98 → 10641.94] notification stuff for float plane through text messages so when there's like oh this thing is
[10641.94 → 10645.38] something's going on with this server or whatever we get texted about it so I get texted all the time
[10645.38 → 10650.02] with automated messages that I usually don't actually really need to see, and then a few people started
[10650.02 → 10655.70] texting me again and I'm like why are we doing this stop it I think I've texted you lately
[10656.66 → 10660.98] no I don't think oh no I mostly message you on discord yeah yeah yeah which is fine people are like
[10660.98 → 10665.54] yeah I only email with my girlfriend when forwarding shipping notifications like I mean the only reason
[10665.54 → 10671.54] I email Yvonne is to coordinate kid stuff or work stuff like it's not like we would normally
[10672.26 → 10679.86] email, but we do email a lot because we work together um but for me email is just the most reliable
[10679.86 → 10686.18] way to get in touch with me so i I realize that I'm probably going full okay boomer when I'm
[10686.18 → 10692.34] coordinating with another uh you know content creator through dms or something somewhere and I'm like
[10692.34 → 10699.22] hey yeah i would love to talk about this further email me here's my email address because
[10699.78 → 10703.94] otherwise I know that I'm not reliable enough and when it's email I can copy in someone from the
[10703.94 → 10706.02] team who can take care of them and when it's not email
[10706.02 → 10712.50] it's going to just go into a black hole there's no hope for it so I might as well just not even
[10712.50 → 10718.90] bother replying he said it he confirms the boomer oh what is it now so I used to use something called
[10718.90 → 10726.42] pigeon do you know what pigeon is do you know what pigeon is uh no, no I don't it's a bird so
[10726.98 → 10731.78] it's not a plane that's why I like it no um it's definitely not superman oh sorry Dan oh
[10731.78 → 10741.94] oh pigeon I am uh so I used to use this many years ago um does it work on Windows I remember
[10741.94 → 10747.94] it existing wait isn't it like a multi-client thing yeah uh it is okay and I decided to check
[10747.94 → 10752.42] it out because I was like I wish pigeon supported more stuff and then I was like maybe I should check
[10752.42 → 10761.94] I checked plugins and whoa what's up whoa does it support WhatsApp uh wow it supports like dating
[10761.94 → 10767.06] apps and Facebook battle I think I saw it here for a second steam what's that there it is
[10768.90 → 10777.22] it supports protocol so much stuff as I recall I did try this isn't all hold on some of these
[10777.22 → 10787.30] are like mods I did try this, and it was inconvenient or unreliable for some reason okay yeah yeah yeah
[10787.30 → 10794.34] I haven't used it in forever but back in the like MSN messenger uh whatever all the other ones were
[10794.34 → 10801.86] back then trillion was king yeah so you had aim MSN and what was the other thing try ICQ I think was the
[10801.86 → 10807.62] three that made it trillion uh don't quote me on that I could be wrong does trillion still exist
[10807.62 → 10810.10] surely not shut up
[10812.58 → 10817.94] this looks like acquired and rebranded or something there's no way this is the original trillion
[10819.06 → 10825.06] health care specifically targeting health care so they probably have like yeah HIPAA compliant they
[10825.06 → 10829.86] probably have data silo stuff oh they pivoted yeah they went to HIPAA that's interesting that's very
[10829.86 → 10835.62] smart actually yeah interesting unless they screwed up then it's very lawsuit was that image loading
[10835.62 → 10841.30] like is the 90s did that just happen did I see that and did you see that dad I think that they're
[10841.30 → 10847.62] doing a throwback what happened intentionally though so this image on the right-hand side here
[10847.62 → 10852.10] only the like top small percentage of it loaded right away, and then it slowly chunked in what is this
[10852.10 → 10858.98] truly and dot I'm like okay what just happened but a lot slower and chunkier what did you click on
[10858.98 → 10863.46] you clicked on you clicked on shift f5 is what I'm for health care what can you do simple and
[10863.46 → 10870.58] size persistent game chat yeah their site is really not game chat compatible with dozens of open GL and
[10870.58 → 10878.58] direct 3d applications oh boy um all right well anyway it used to be it used to be kind of a thing um
[10879.22 → 10886.66] cool it's a PNG that image is a PNG and I just want to see how big it is it's not very big
[10886.66 → 10891.94] hmm put a PNG on a website in current year
[10896.10 → 10903.38] oh okay well what are we doing uh trillion okay it was able to connect yes I was right it was able
[10903.38 → 10910.50] to connect aim ICQ and MSN messenger simultaneously in one window that was November 29th year 2000
[10910.50 → 10919.30] wow what's the new one that does that beeper I don't know okay no sorry what topic were we
[10919.30 → 10924.74] on I don't know does it matter it's the wan show that what topic what are topics oh yeah fair enough
[10924.74 → 10930.98] uh there's a potential PS5 jailbreak uh PlayStation hacker Andy Nevin otherwise known as the flow
[10930.98 → 10938.42] recently posted on Twitter spoiler alert don't update likely a warning not to update to the
[10938.42 → 10945.86] the newest firmware for PS4 and PS5 according to the flow he recently reported some very cool bugs
[10945.86 → 10951.38] probably via Sony's hacker one bug bounty program which will likely take time for Sony to fix this
[10951.38 → 10956.34] would also mean that the flow currently cannot disclose what those vulnerabilities are until Sony
[10956.34 → 10962.26] makes a patch available, but many are hoping for a kernel level jailbreak however no longer updating
[10962.26 → 10966.90] the console's firmware would also mean no longer accessing the PlayStation network game patches and
[10966.90 → 10973.46] online games discussion question is foregoing PSN game patches and online games worth it for a
[10973.46 → 10977.38] jail breakable PlayStation console and I think we all know the answer to that for a lot of people
[10978.18 → 10981.62] I mean particularly for the PS4 that game library is
[10981.62 → 10989.38] is basically established at this point, and they would love to they would love to play on a jailbroken
[10989.38 → 10997.06] console all right now we can either move on to wan show after dark or you can do your weekend AI thing
[11002.74 → 11008.02] do I do if it's going to take forever, and we're not going to be able to play as many super checks
[11008.02 → 11013.70] it's our hockey game that we play after when I mean we are I thought we got it out of your system
[11013.70 → 11019.46] earlier what AI yeah oh yeah we talked about it pre-show oh my god we haven't talked about google
[11019.46 → 11026.34] podcast yet either yeah full point chat saying AI okay well let me do the Google podcast real quick
[11026.34 → 11029.38] yeah after eight years google podcast will be discontinued next year
[11031.86 → 11036.74] topic over yeah that sucks I guess if you're into podcasts and a lot of people seem to be very
[11036.74 → 11042.18] upset about it, I use Google podcast oh really yeah I legitimately don't want to use anything else
[11042.18 → 11049.14] and this sucks all right you heard it here first it came on my phone a podcast app does not need to
[11049.14 → 11054.90] be elaborate let me download the thing I guess there wasn't enough money in it sorry yeah because I don't
[11054.90 → 11065.06] think there was any right you're going to add that to float plane no go away we don't need we're not doing
[11065.06 → 11069.54] it's a dangled development yeah I will not keep everybody employed
[11072.26 → 11076.50] it's not happening welcome to asking about features by the way
[11078.10 → 11084.58] no and I'm mad about it, I know what we need to do, and we're doing if it's okay we're going to be fine
[11084.58 → 11092.18] anyway AI stuff um open released an open AI released an update for ChatGPT that allows it to
[11092.18 → 11099.46] in quote see hear and speak users can now hold entirely spoken conversations with the bot
[11099.46 → 11106.58] use images in prompts and have it generate images using the also recently released dial e3 which closes
[11106.58 → 11112.26] the gap between it and mid-journey um if you want to open up the article on your screen and share screen
[11112.26 → 11117.22] I'll just keep plowing through the talking uh the one that I want you to try to find is the bike repair

[11157.22 → 11164.18] uh specialties bearing the likeness of celebrity personalities like snoop dog as the dungeon master
[11164.18 → 11168.42] he does text-based RPG stuff and Mr beast as the funny man
[11168.42 → 11176.74] users who are uh who are part of the beta rollout can message these characters through their social
[11176.74 → 11183.38] media profiles on Instagram Facebook and WhatsApp okay you don't sound that excited about this i just
[11183.38 → 11191.46] the funny man is like the worst name I like feel bad for Mr beast he's just referred to as the funny
[11191.46 → 11198.98] man it's kind of funny yeah but like I don't know like I feel like if you call the comedian
[11198.98 → 11205.62] the funny man it wouldn't be a positive thing because they'd be like I'd rather people know who my
[11205.62 → 11214.42] what my name is like not like a vague not super positive version of what their job I don't know anyway
[11214.42 → 11221.38] um Zuck explained at connect that these characters are a proof of concept for meta's new AI studio
[11221.38 → 11226.18] a service that will allow creators and brands to build AIs to represent themselves that'll make
[11226.18 → 11232.50] a lot of money in certain circles uh meta AI will be integrated into the newly announced second gen
[11232.50 → 11239.46] ray-ban meta uh smart glasses first gen was ray-ban stories giving wearers the ability to prompt it with
[11239.46 → 11245.62] their voice and images from the built-in 12 megapixel camera so you can ask it to do things like identify
[11245.62 → 11250.74] monuments and translate signs it also supports live-streaming to Facebook and Instagram those are
[11250.74 → 11256.66] actually crazy have you seen those no so the glasses that you wear that look pretty normal from
[11256.66 → 11261.06] the images that I saw but I didn't get to see like back here where they tend to stuff a lot of the
[11261.06 → 11266.90] batteries and stuff, but you can just be looking at something and be like what is this, and it will tell
[11266.90 → 11272.50] you that's pretty cool which is pretty cool uh hold on a second I've got that uh bike repair demo for
[11272.50 → 11280.50] you yeah I assume this is the one it's got 40 000 up votes it's from uh open AI yeah if help me
[11280.50 → 11285.22] hold on if there's some is this just YouTube oh it's help me lower my bike seat
[11287.86 → 11292.18] mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
[11295.30 → 11300.58] so it gives some instructions, and it says if you have tools uh let me see them and stuff like that
[11301.62 → 11306.02] so they take a picture of this part, and they're like is this what you're talking about more or less
[11306.02 → 11313.70] is this the lever, and they're like nope it's not a lever it's a bolt wow you'll need an Allen wrench
[11313.70 → 11322.34] and then they attach uh a picture of the manual for their Allen wrench kit and a picture of their Allen
[11322.34 → 11329.46] wrench set, and it tells them which one out of the set okay who would ever do that though yeah, but it's
[11329.46 → 11335.54] functionality yeah I guess so you gotta take steps in the right direction I don't know if
[11335.54 → 11339.30] they would include the manual might be a bit of a cheat but yeah yeah
[11343.30 → 11349.78] but yeah pretty interesting yeah that's pretty cool um I don't know if we have a link in here but the um
[11349.78 → 11357.78] um the second gen ray band meta smart glasses oh my goodness I hope that's not the official name
[11357.78 → 11365.06] um those look pretty wild as well um yeah Jaden post in flow plane chat a new mass data
[11365.06 → 11371.86] collection scheme just dropped yeah absolutely um it's going to be rough uh ethical images Getty Images has
[11371.86 → 11378.50] now announced their own AI art generator built by NVIDIA and reportedly trained entirely on Getty's own
[11378.50 → 11384.10] library of licensed images this is kind of cool Getty has previously sued AI art generators for using
[11384.10 → 11389.78] its copyrighted images in their training data Getty also says that the images generated in this manner
[11389.78 → 11397.62] will not be added to its existing library what are they for then that's the weirdest response they're
[11397.62 → 11406.10] for they're for generating AI art, but they're not going to take their generated stuff and put it into
[11406.10 → 11412.18] their library you just use it to generate stuff got it yeah okay so you're not you're not copying
[11412.18 → 11418.02] photocopying so they're not generating these for their own use and sale you can use it okay
[11418.02 → 11423.06] I understand yeah I love this one most this is my favourite I actually did want to talk about this
[11423.94 → 11431.54] the internet is melting Twitter user uh Tyler gale sure close enough uh recently discovered that google
[11431.54 → 11438.10] search was highlighting an answer sourced from Quora that claimed that eggs can be melted uh Quora itself
[11438.10 → 11444.50] claimed that the information was taken from ChatGPT however Quora actually sourced this information uh
[11444.50 → 11456.58] from an outdated gpt3 API I love this so much AI's feeding off of AI generated or like uh training data
[11456.58 → 11461.94] like training data being built from training data that was built from training data we are going
[11461.94 → 11466.98] to end up with some wild stuff we've been talking about this for a while right like it's yeah it's
[11466.98 → 11473.30] going to be rough um AI intelligence the CIA is preparing to launch an AI tool intended for all
[11473.30 → 11479.06] U.S. intelligence agencies according to the CIA the AI would be able to sort through the huge amount
[11479.06 → 11484.82] of information collected by U.S. intelligence with links back to the original source of the information
[11484.82 → 11492.42] all right there was a demo that I showed Dan uh someone on Twitter who took a screenshot from
[11492.42 → 11500.10] some sass websites dashboard like software as a service yeah okay um and fed that into ChatGPT and
[11500.10 → 11506.98] asked it for the code, and it spat out a bunch of code, and they shoved it into an IDE and just ran it and
[11506.98 → 11514.74] it worked, and it gave them a Bass website the thing that what like the dashboard
[11514.74 → 11520.42] for a set like you know your selections on the left-hand side some charts and dashboards
[11520.42 → 11524.66] and things that you'd expect all that kind of stuff the part that isn't as cool, and you could tell
[11525.86 → 11531.46] Mr Twitter user um that they wanted a lot of views and a lot of clicks on this because they didn't
[11531.46 → 11536.90] exactly try to use it right because no part of it's actually going to be functional yeah uh there's a
[11536.90 → 11540.66] bunch of buttons there are a lot of charts those charts aren't going to be fed by any actual data
[11540.66 → 11545.62] yeah all of it's just going to be hard code back end is the hard part not necessarily well okay
[11546.50 → 11550.66] there's complicated things in front end too and what I'm saying is that none of those were done
[11551.22 → 11558.50] sure none of no actual it's its just like there's a static chart that we made I just mean I could ask
[11558.50 → 11565.14] literally anyone in the editing den to put together a quote-unquote you know software as a service dashboard
[11565.14 → 11569.14] and if they haven't actually done any of the coding for the front end, and they haven't actually done
[11569.14 → 11575.70] any of the like populating it with any data that anyone would actually want to use of the back end
[11575.70 → 11581.86] then they haven't really built a software as a service platform have they uh yeah no it's its
[11581.86 → 11586.34] definitely yeah it's, but my point was they didn't even try to like interact with it in any way shape
[11586.34 → 11594.10] or form at all um oh someone linked the meta smart glasses in the chat we can have a look at these
[11595.70 → 11597.54] I've heard of v0 it's cool
[11600.66 → 11605.94] so how like yeah how like thick are they yeah can, I just get a clean picture it feels like they're
[11605.94 → 11610.10] trying to obfuscate it because I couldn't tell when I was trying to look earlier yeah they're a little
[11610.10 → 11614.66] bit they're a little bit thick, but they're I mean it doesn't look too bad yeah not bad this is the
[11614.66 → 11620.58] the cleanest picture we have of it uh okay it hides the back yeah no i I don't think there is a back
[11620.58 → 11623.38] this is thick enough that it's probably got some batteries and stuff in it
[11626.02 → 11633.06] power switch right there yeah okay uh hello oh why are websites so terrible these days does it so it
[11633.06 → 11639.70] has a capture button if you're capturing things does it indicate to people that aren't you yeah I think
[11639.70 → 11648.50] it has a light yeah pretty cool I don't know if I need to try this I don't know man maybe I am
[11648.50 → 11651.30] getting old because I just don't think I care about that
[11654.34 → 11660.02] like i I'm gonna I like i theoretically you've talked about it for a long time when it can identify
[11660.02 → 11668.82] people for me and like to remind me like pro actually proactively remind me of like you know hey you
[11668.82 → 11673.70] haven't asked about their kids in a while you know whatever right then yeah I could see it being very
[11673.70 → 11679.86] useful, but honestly we are so far away from that I just don't really feel like I need to engage with
[11679.86 → 11688.42] these not really that functional prototypes at this point and I don't know maybe I'm just being a
[11688.42 → 11695.22] fuddy-duddy about it, but you know we're still at the point where if you have more than one jams in
[11695.22 → 11699.14] your address book it's hard to call jams with your voice like i just
[11702.66 → 11707.78] you're making a face that I am really struggling to interpret I don't know if I want to show it on
[11707.78 → 11711.94] stream uh well too late now well no I didn't do it okay
[11718.42 → 11726.42] I don't know I don't know why would you click that what were you expecting to happen
[11727.30 → 11731.78] I was trying to see if I needed to ban them but I was like it's handyman so I feel like it's not
[11731.78 → 11737.30] going to be a bannable thing, but it looks like a bannable thing Luke that's a work laptop if I didn't
[11737.30 → 11742.82] know who this person was if I didn't recognize this person from chat I was I would have just banned them
[11742.82 → 11747.30] right but I recognize this person in chat I've interacted directly with this person quite a few
[11747.30 → 11752.50] times so I was like okay well I'm gonna check first, and then it was glorious I don't know
[11753.38 → 11756.82] and we're about to gloriously switch over into when show after dark I think
[11759.30 → 11759.94] oh man
[11764.02 → 11770.58] thanks Dan always a professional that's a transition he doesn't actually walk in front of the camera it's
[11770.58 → 11774.90] just a transition he plays back it's a transparency we recorded Dan walking in front of the lens on
[11774.90 → 11781.70] the green screen I don't know if you guys could hear him, but he said star wipe as he walked back
[11782.98 → 11787.62] it's a really low budget Dan you are a star you just say the name of the transition
[11789.46 → 11794.10] oh I just assumed you meant that you're the star, and you're the white oh yeah maybe more wipe than
[11794.10 → 11800.42] star okay where are we were are we why is there a wan show after dark square
[11800.42 → 11805.38] on wan show bingo that's that's cheating that's not it's always when show after dark yeah
[11805.94 → 11811.70] unless that's in the entire wan show is just wan show after dark depending on how much sleep I've had
[11815.22 → 11822.58] oh my goodness anyway all right let's hop into it yeah hi LLD I'm looking at downsizing my pc setup
[11822.58 → 11827.46] and the cleanest setup video from a few years ago has piqued my interest how viable do you believe
[11827.46 → 11835.38] that setup is today any shortcomings um okay we've done the cleanest set up a couple of times so it would be
[11835.38 → 11845.06] nice to know exactly which one you're talking about um okay so here we go yeah basically homeless has
[11845.06 → 11851.62] made it so that we can never actually win this again so that's frustrating but anyway let's move on
[11851.62 → 11857.22] um we're still going to do really clean setups they just won't be like this is this one is
[11857.22 → 11865.30] very cool but not necessarily that practical um if okay is you mean this one so in the oh wait I think
[11865.30 → 11871.22] there's a difference between clean and like non-existent not to diminish what they did that was
[11871.22 → 11878.02] actually one of the most like incredible things I've seen in a long time okay you must mean this one so we
[11878.02 → 11886.34] embedded the cables into the desk, and then we routed the cables down the leg of the desk to a tower that
[11886.34 → 11893.14] was just sitting next to it um I don't remember if we put a wireless charger in for the mouse no we
[11893.14 → 11899.22] didn't that was one of the upgrades we made for this one uh where we the wireless chargers are embedded
[11899.22 → 11905.78] in the desk uh this one only had the chi charger embedded um and then with both of them the monitor cable
[11905.78 → 11910.50] cable comes right down yes really hard to put my mouse over this and not have it anyway the monitor
[11910.50 → 11914.66] cable comes down into the desk and then is like routed down to the computer which is at the
[11914.66 → 11920.66] side um totally viable I mean the only drawback is if you ever need to change out a cable it's a pain in
[11920.66 → 11931.06] the butt as for this one uh where's where's the other one ah project zero cables the cleanest desk setup ever
[11931.06 → 11939.94] uh this one uses a thunderbolt e GPU thing, and it has kind of like a laptop embedded in it, i uh I would say
[11939.94 → 11945.70] that thunderbolt 3 slash thunderbolt 4 with their bandwidth limitations have kind of reached the end of
[11945.70 → 11952.42] their useful life for external GPU setups these days but thunderbolt 5 looks very promising it doubles or
[11952.42 → 11959.78] depending on the usage it's not really 100 clear to me right now I doubles or triples the available bandwidth which
[11959.78 → 11966.50] intel says should make it much better for e GPU and I'm really excited about that because if we are
[11966.50 → 11975.30] not bottlenecked by you know lesser mobile GPU setups, and we have a proper high speed link to it mobile CPUs
[11975.30 → 11984.34] have gotten freaking fast like, so close for non-all core loads like games so close to their desktop
[11984.34 → 11991.38] counterparts that um no I think it could be very viable what do you foresee to be the biggest challenge
[11991.38 → 11998.02] tech or otherwise that uh you foresee the youth today having to deal with or comes to terms with oh privacy
[11998.98 → 12006.02] privacy they have none um every thing they've ever said is documented somewhere and that's going to come
[12006.02 → 12012.58] back and bite them there are things that I'm gladder in my past I mean fewer for me than most because I'm so
[12012.58 → 12017.14] documented I don't know if this is the parents or the kids but I've kind of noticed like
[12019.54 → 12027.30] a decent amount of them seem to be avoiding that fairly well a lot of them also just super don't
[12027.30 → 12032.66] I think that this might be one of your little kind of sheltered things totally could be like the mainstream
[12032.66 → 12039.54] parents a lot of them are just post everything yeah I don't know man all right then
[12039.54 → 12048.02] well that sucks hey DLL I work in the 12 volt industry of car stereos remote starts that kind
[12048.02 → 12054.18] of thing Luke have you looked at after market options to get new features like android auto on your older
[12054.18 → 12061.62] car not extensively I know some fairly anecdotal evidence that people have had a hard time with that
[12061.62 → 12068.90] I know someone who uh put android auto into the same model of uh Acura that I have and had so many
[12068.90 → 12077.06] problems with it that they ended up ripping it out um so based off of very weak anecdotal evidence that
[12077.06 → 12083.22] I have from other people I haven't bothered um that is the only thing yeah someone in Philip chat they all
[12083.22 → 12089.54] suck it's like yeah I don't know um that is the only thing I'm interested in though we have a video coming on
[12089.54 → 12099.78] that um yeah proof basically um wants to take his he has like the same civic that I had his like 2003
[12099.78 → 12110.74] super civic, and he wants to modernize it, and normally we don't really like to do projects like that um but I was
[12110.74 → 12117.38] like I am super curious to know the answer to this and I consider the amount of extra work that I know
[12117.38 → 12122.02] you're going to do on this outside of ours to be more than worth what it costs us to like
[12123.22 → 12130.34] buy like a stupid android like head unit or something like that so sure let's do this as an experiment um
[12131.06 → 12138.42] yeah go for it uh let's let's do it up let's let's modernize a 2003 Honda Civic I'm kind of excited about it
[12138.42 → 12144.18] because it'll either be like just a complete show or it'll be really awesome and people will learn a lot
[12147.38 → 12152.98] has Linus's workload decreased since stepping down it sounds like he has a lot less obligations overall
[12153.54 → 12156.34] thank you for the years of content what do you think Luke no
[12158.90 → 12159.38] not at all
[12161.46 → 12166.98] high LDL it's like hold on I'll give it I'll give it oh my god do you know that meme
[12166.98 → 12173.30] where the person's trying to fit blocks into your thing that yeah, and they're like uh usually it's
[12173.30 → 12177.14] like some new game or something on one block, and they're like how do I make this fit you see them
[12177.14 → 12181.94] taking out the sleep block to put that's a she comic something like that yeah it's just
[12182.58 → 12188.74] how do I make this work take out some duties input more new ones like you didn't know workload
[12188.74 → 12193.14] was lost I would even question I think at certain points over the last little bit it's been higher
[12193.14 → 12198.18] than it was before now the new things are fun so they can take up even more space I don't necessarily
[12198.18 → 12205.30] know if that's the case I'm exhausted guys um it's been more work than before um a lot of
[12205.30 → 12212.02] what I've been doing is uh like I have a boss now I guess is probably the best way I could put it
[12212.58 → 12218.58] so I've always had a boss that was fun there wasn't it literally Tuesday there was a meeting
[12218.58 → 12222.42] where he was like I need this thing, and you're like when am I supposed to do it he's like well i
[12222.42 → 12232.82] need it by this day, and you were like okay I was like whoa I mean the thing is like it's a weird
[12232.82 → 12239.62] dynamic right because I pay him so what am I going to do pay him to tell me stuff and like not listen to
[12239.62 → 12244.90] him what's the point of that yeah how am I getting how am I getting my money's worth like do you see
[12244.90 → 12252.90] what I mean this like super weird power dynamic it's like well I'm pretty much throwing away
[12253.86 → 12260.26] throwing away the money of him being employed here if I don't listen to him so I guess all right yes sir
[12263.46 → 12269.70] yeah and I mean there's some stuff that I've taken on for myself like i um somewhat
[12269.70 → 12278.90] not notoriously did not review our videos or watch them for many years ever yeah I don't think i ever
[12278.90 → 12284.74] watched our videos um and which is why like a lot of them would have like blatant especially in the
[12284.74 → 12290.02] early days they'd be like missing audio for stuff like that because I just hadn't looked at the
[12290.02 → 12296.26] footage at all I've just uploaded raw right of the camera um and lately I've been watching almost every
[12296.26 → 12300.34] video and providing detailed feedback on almost every video because it's not that I don't know
[12300.34 → 12309.06] how to review a video it's just that I find it to be um I find it does not hold my attention very well
[12309.06 → 12315.22] as a task and I find I have found over the years that the better use of my time has been to
[12315.22 → 12321.54] be working on the next video and that's just a mentality shift that as an organization we've been
[12321.54 → 12327.78] undergoing here and I have had to kind of I mean I'm not CEO but I still have to put on my leadership
[12327.78 → 12334.42] pants and and and try to set a good example um for so I have been I've been reviewing every video
[12334.42 → 12343.06] I've also been trying to convert um a lot of those video reviews into sops uh standard operating procedures
[12343.06 → 12349.14] that can be used to make our videos better in the longer term so like here's an example of something
[12349.14 → 12356.34] from a recent one i I have like a doc that I put um it's called process improvements for pre slash
[12356.34 → 12364.26] post slash production um so here's one that I wrote um that I called visual intent um
[12366.66 → 12373.30] this example oh here there's a better look uh this example is a dense wall of text that adds very little
[12373.30 → 12378.90] to what the host is saying nothing is highlighted making it hard to parse so it's not a type one it
[12378.90 → 12383.78] adds very little to what the host is saying so it's not type two, and it's definitely not entertaining
[12383.78 → 12389.46] which rules out type three it also lingers unnecessarily and what I'm doing here is I'm
[12389.46 → 12399.70] defining uh how our visual guidance uh should our the purpose our visual guidance should serve it
[12399.70 → 12405.14] should be reinforcing supplemental or entertaining, and we have to make sure that we're editing with intent
[12405.14 → 12410.82] slash purpose rather than just throwing a visual onto the frame for the point for the purpose of having
[12410.82 → 12418.02] a visual and so things like this I think are in the long term going to make a big difference but
[12418.98 → 12428.18] in the meantime are a ton of work um a ton of work for me so yeah no I'm really I'm exhausted um
[12428.18 → 12433.30] yeah so that's probably not the answer that you really wanted but
[12435.38 → 12439.70] I mean you know what it's one of those things though where uh people see what they want
[12439.70 → 12445.30] to see right uh you know we've talked about all the comments from people whether it's after these
[12445.30 → 12450.26] are so much better now that Linus has so much energy because he has a new CEO or these videos are so
[12450.26 → 12456.74] much better now after the production break it's so different um you know that's that's not necessarily the
[12456.74 → 12460.34] case you know some of some of the ones post-production break I haven't reviewed and that
[12460.34 → 12463.94] doesn't mean that they're worse it just means that I didn't review them and I'm not like creating
[12463.94 → 12470.18] processes out of them um so if you guys you know want to see that you know Linus has help on the
[12470.18 → 12474.50] executive side, and he's so much happier making videos then yeah you go ahead and see that
[12474.50 → 12479.14] if that makes you enjoy the videos more then I don't want to contradict it, but you know no I'm tired
[12479.14 → 12484.82] it turns out that my job is a job there was a while there when it was pretty common that Linus and
[12484.82 → 12488.66] I would play games after work and now that like doesn't happen because every time I reach out to
[12488.66 → 12498.02] him he's like I'm working yeah my day yesterday uh started with calls and then was an all-day AMD
[12498.02 → 12503.46] ultimate tech upgrade shoot and or maybe I'm getting my days confused because the days have grown very
[12503.46 → 12509.38] confusing no this was Wednesday it started with calls then I had an all-day AMD ultimate upgrade shoot
[12509.38 → 12515.54] then I drove to the office to shoot the iPhone 15 pro and pro max short circuit and then I got home
[12515.54 → 12524.74] around 10 30 or 11 and then yesterday was oh man I'm going to struggle to remember what happened yesterday
[12524.74 → 12537.30] uh no wait yes oh my gosh I don't even know what happened yesterday uh yesterday
[12539.38 → 12548.42] oh yeah yeah oh, oh we shot a sequel to the uh tech shop we went through the
[12548.42 → 12554.02] stuff uh Jordan you guys have seen him, but he hasn't really said much on camera he uh he helped me
[12554.02 → 12560.82] with the all team u gaming setup um so he co-hosts for the first time as like a alongside like
[12560.82 → 12568.82] co-host of the video, and we did duel gaming setups can it run crisis you know we throwback
[12568.82 → 12577.46] meme um, and we had kind of a fun rule set for it where kind of uh like draft style almost we each had
[12577.46 → 12583.06] to pick a category of product one at a time so rather than just being a mad rush to go get stuff
[12583.06 → 12590.02] we took post-it notes and wrote all the things that you need CPU motherboard GPU power supply all that
[12590.02 → 12596.82] kind of stuff we had five flare items um that we could put in there and then at each pick we have
[12596.82 → 12601.86] to reveal what the next thing that we're going to get is so we both picked items in different orders
[12602.98 → 12608.82] so that means that if one of us picked CPU like drafted CPU very early on then we could get the
[12608.82 → 12614.58] first pick of the CPUs but the other might pick GPU and might go for that uh so it's going to be
[12614.58 → 12621.22] really fun video uh so I shot that and then I did something else and then I had my badminton
[12621.22 → 12626.42] class for a couple of hours and then I went home and I reviewed two videos and then I slept uh so
[12626.42 → 12633.06] it's been basically like that um pretty constantly yeah i I did manage to play two hours of balder's
[12633.06 → 12637.38] gate three with Yvonne that was on either I think that was on Monday or Tuesday you had two free hours
[12638.34 → 12643.38] I can usually tell how busy Linus's life is by how much he wants to play games
[12643.38 → 12650.66] because he'll bug me he'll be like hey little man wants to play whatever or something, and it's
[12650.66 → 12654.66] like okay cool yeah let's figure that out and then that'll happen for like a little while and then
[12654.66 → 12658.90] something will happen at work and then suddenly that goes away I have played I have played some
[12658.90 → 12663.70] games lately though I just haven't been playing multiplayer games because the hours that oh yeah
[12663.70 → 12669.14] that's fair the hours I've been available to play have been very unusual I'll see you jump online and
[12669.14 → 12673.22] start playing something as I'm going to bed yeah and I'm a night owl because I've so that's because
[12673.22 → 12677.62] I've been working until then, and you need some amount of time to cool down before you go to bed i
[12677.62 → 12682.66] actually do so i I mean I played all the way through chain decos yeah and i actually just finished sea of
[12682.66 → 12687.14] stars I was going to say yeah yeah it's a really short game little man wants to play I'm not talking about
[12687.14 → 12695.30] him oh my god yeah no that's our that's that's our uh internet safe nickname for my son yeah um
[12695.30 → 12701.30] yeah so I finished sea of stars um I have a lot of thoughts some of them I can't really share
[12701.30 → 12706.42] without spoilers it's a really short game it's an it's a small it's a small game in a small world
[12706.42 → 12711.70] but it's uh it's a very beautiful it's a very beautiful game the music is absolutely incredible
[12712.34 → 12721.94] um I have an I have a thing about Starfield that is an omega spoiler so I can't say what it is but i
[12721.94 → 12727.22] will say that I think it is one of the worst narrative decisions that I've seen in a video
[12727.22 → 12733.86] game potentially in my entire life isn't that like a huge thing that everyone hates on I've like heard
[12733.86 → 12740.02] that there's a thing in Starfield I've been trying to avoid it so I don't know I got it hope so
[12741.54 → 12749.14] but I don't know yeah okay it's like actually just stunningly stupid I don't know yeah my big thing
[12749.14 → 12755.62] with games is I hate it when they I hate it when they wimp out and actually novels too i um there's
[12755.62 → 12761.70] this uh there's this it's like a's like a Christian series of novels it's um called the
[12761.70 → 12767.46] wing feather saga, and it's kind of it's Christian in the same not even to the same degree but in a
[12767.46 → 12772.34] similar sense that like c.s lewis's work is sort of like a like the chronicles of Narnia is like a
[12772.34 → 12779.06] Christian allegory or whatever, but you can absolutely enjoy them regardless of you know any kind of belief
[12779.06 → 12789.54] Christianity Judaism or whatever else um and what I think it does really well is it keeps the stakes
[12789.54 → 12797.78] high uh you know when um and this is something that happens relatively you know not towards the end um
[12797.78 → 12805.14] you know one of the characters suffers an affliction like a really life-changing awful
[12805.14 → 12814.66] affliction and there is no magic vial that you can just get and then is its better um and i I feel
[12814.66 → 12820.98] like so much modern media particularly for kids like these are kids books um so I read them to my kids
[12820.98 → 12829.38] um so much modern media shies away from that it's like no, no there's, but then there was a cure-all or
[12829.38 → 12834.26] then they were resurrected don't worry you don't have that one's pretty rough yeah i will throw
[12834.26 → 12840.98] somewhat of a counter in here that i so i I agree with your statement but i also kind of equally
[12840.98 → 12847.14] dislike when the writing i I feel like they get to a point they're like I have to be edgy and gritty with
[12847.14 → 12851.86] this so I'm just going to like kill somebody off for like absolutely no reason out of nowhere and it
[12851.86 → 12856.82] whatever I don't know this is something that I had a huge problem with in star craft 2.
[12856.82 → 12862.58] I thought you were going to say uh Star Wars the whatever the like stupid crappy middle one was
[12862.58 → 12868.02] oh there's plenty of those and everyone just sacrifices themselves constantly yeah yeah and
[12868.02 → 12875.54] then and anyway star oh man you just but i just remembered when they're when what's his name
[12875.54 → 12879.86] I don't remember any of the names because I don't even want to, but he's like driving out to go like
[12879.86 → 12884.98] smash into them in like the field of sand that turns red when you walk on it or whatever and then
[12884.98 → 12889.70] the chick like smashes into his thing to be like no, but then they're going to die anyway, and it's just
[12889.70 → 12898.42] like what's happening anyway sorry um no in star craft 2 there's this character named Lycus um isn't
[12898.42 → 12903.78] Lycus from the first one I think he's in both okay there are a bunch of characters that are in both
[12903.78 → 12910.02] sure um most the main characters I think are in both, and he's he's like stuck in his blue armour yeah
[12910.02 → 12915.06] Lycus Finley he can't get out oh no introduced in star craft 2 oh I thought it was in the first one
[12916.02 → 12921.38] might have it's pretty old at this point might have I don't know i just I know the name so
[12922.18 → 12925.70] I might have told you this story before because it annoys me so much that's fair um
[12926.66 → 12932.34] uh but he just gets killed off, and it's like there's this whole narrative thing like the whole game
[12932.34 → 12938.82] game where it's like the Kerrigan this game's old I was going to say are they just trying to recreate
[12938.82 → 12945.78] like the Kerrigan moment where you're like no not Kerrigan i kind of think so like Kerrigan is finally
[12945.78 → 12954.26] saved oh why but Lycus is like paid off to kill her and whatever his name is the other main character
[12954.26 → 12961.22] Jim Rayner yeah Rayner is like with Kerrigan so Rayner wants to save Kerrigan Lycus wants to kill
[12961.22 → 12966.82] Kerrigan Lycus goes to kill Kerrigan and then Rayner's like nope and just headshots him even
[12966.82 → 12972.90] though they were bros the entire time and I was like no real effort was put into like can we get
[12972.90 → 12980.10] him out of the suit there was no like can we fake Kerrigan's death it was just like nope I guess Lycus
[12980.10 → 12988.18] is just going to die now, and it was like okay can I just jump in and say that it bothers me a lot
[12988.18 → 12996.02] in video game cut scenes in games where everyone is constantly shooting at each other with bullets
[12996.82 → 13003.22] yeah, and then it's a one shot, and then it's a one shot in a cut scene it's a totally irrational thing
[13003.22 → 13012.34] it doesn't matter, but it kills my immersion yeah totally destroys my sense of my suspension of
[13012.34 → 13017.70] disbelief and you know honestly it's the same thing for swords like you play a Final Fantasy game
[13018.26 → 13026.02] and you'll have the entire team with their giant you know 39 pounds sword like
[13026.02 → 13027.70] uh
[13029.70 → 13035.54] and then there's like one shot and there's like a tiny little knife and yeah yeah oh I'm bleeding so
[13035.54 → 13040.82] much from this tiny wound that i in this game that has resurrection but let's ignore that part yeah
[13040.82 → 13047.54] yeah yeah what is the point of phoenix's if the down doesn't pick them the back-up
[13052.10 → 13058.42] one that was worse to me was I was playing Diablo 3, and they kill off declared cane, but it's just like
[13058.98 → 13065.14] so random and doesn't serve like anything you're just kind of like you walk into some house if I remember
[13065.14 → 13069.78] it's been a long time, but you walk into some house, and it's just like he's dead and there's no like
[13070.74 → 13075.54] oh my effing g declared cane is dead, and we're playing Diablo it's just like time to move on
[13076.10 → 13082.66] guess he's dead everybody else dies it's fine I'm just like man like use this moment make it more
[13082.66 → 13091.14] impactful like if is is Lycus and uh trainer really really really tried for a long time and like
[13091.14 → 13097.22] wrestled with this thing and like there was no there was no other option than they have like this duel
[13097.86 → 13107.94] like sure okay but no bang it's like I don't know it's just so like there's no payoff it feels like
[13107.94 → 13113.38] they just deleted this character because they were like uh, uh we should probably have that because this
[13113.38 → 13119.46] is like a story for adults so somebody's going to die it's like yeah sure, but it should like
[13119.46 → 13124.02] be written well cosmos 47 are you talking about cross code
[13127.14 → 13132.74] okay hold up that's actual realism Markov style his example however is in a game where it's not like
[13132.74 → 13139.14] that yeah if it's in a game where bullets do bullet things then yeah that's fine but if it's in a game
[13139.14 → 13144.50] where bullets are made out of bunny farts then it's not really applicable yeah then it's then
[13144.50 → 13150.34] it's its it's contradictory like it's you're playing halo, and you just finished the campaign
[13150.34 → 13158.82] after taking 87 000 bullets and then somebody one-shots you in a cut scene it's like I don't get it
[13158.82 → 13167.46] yeah yeah it's its silly i I are you uh okay are are you a super powerful space ranger or are you
[13167.46 → 13173.94] just like a guy yeah it's like what's going on and that's not a very good example necessarily because
[13173.94 → 13179.78] I don't know that that happens in halo, but either answer is fine all I ask is for it to be consistent
[13179.78 → 13180.42] yeah
[13183.70 → 13190.26] hi LDL cholesterol I'm a third year pharma student in Cincinnati Ohio I think that's a
[13190.26 → 13197.70] it's a protein chain or something uh did ivan's learning background help her learn
[13197.70 → 13203.86] finances quicker from being in a pretty heavy field of sorting out information I wouldn't say that i
[13203.86 → 13210.98] would say Ivan's aptitude for untaking data organizing it keeping it organized and being
[13210.98 → 13219.38] just extremely detail oriented helped her be good at both pharmacy and finance hi guys first time merch
[13219.38 → 13223.94] message is there any notable difference in preference for merch that you guys see between
[13223.94 → 13230.58] regions that's a great thing that we should track that's interesting actually I'm amazed you don't
[13232.18 → 13238.18] well I mean the data's there you could add that after you uh you had podcasting
[13239.54 → 13246.98] what are we adding to flow play Dan stop it hey Luke Linus and Dan love the show do you see 12 gigabit
[13246.98 → 13253.46] cards uh 12 gigs of VRAM being enough for 2k ultra settings in most games for the next few years
[13253.46 → 13257.70] or are we approaching times when 12 gigs isn't enough uh yeah I think it'll be fine for the next
[13257.70 → 13263.22] few years, but that also depends on what the mid-console generation refreshes look like we haven't
[13263.22 → 13268.18] seen this before and I don't know how it's going to change the requirements for games what we know
[13268.18 → 13274.74] is that developers are going to target whatever the latest generation of games that they can
[13275.70 → 13280.98] sell against are so there's going to be a delay from when that generation launches to when we
[13280.98 → 13286.66] really take the most advantage of it so you can kind of look to console hardware to guide what your pc
[13286.66 → 13292.26] spec might need to be plus some because it'll run in a lot of cases less efficiently on pc and or it'll
[13292.26 → 13296.66] allow you to crank the details up more on pc so you might want to overkill it a little bit so with that
[13296.66 → 13304.02] in mind then if the PS5 and the Xbox Series X are what we've got for consoles for the next little bit
[13304.02 → 13310.42] yeah I would expect to get a couple more years at least a few more years out of a video card like
[13310.42 → 13315.30] that knowing that even if those console refreshes happen we're probably not going to have developers
[13315.30 → 13320.18] actually building games to target them until are releasing the games that they're building to target
[13320.18 → 13326.82] them until a year or two after they launch I mean Sony they do a better job of launch games but uh
[13326.82 → 13332.02] on the especially on the Microsoft side yeah maybe not quite as much um and that's that's just kind of
[13332.02 → 13337.22] a good general rule so we saw this explosion in the demandingness of games over the last couple of
[13337.22 → 13342.50] years, but that's not an accident that's not a mystery that's just because we got high-end consoles
[13342.50 → 13348.18] a few years ago that game developers were like all right let's go when they started building games for
[13348.18 → 13353.78] them and then all of a sudden we needed faster pcs yeah i I want to interject really quick uh papa
[13353.78 → 13358.58] Trotsky i I admit I put halo out there as like an example for the damage thing I wasn't actually trying
[13358.58 → 13364.10] to go after halo I was just trying to talk about like the time to kill in halo games but papa Trotsky
[13364.10 → 13369.70] pointed out halo reach I think ended the right way uh the ending is a super long battle that ends with
[13369.70 → 13374.90] a cut scene of the character slowly getting beat up before getting overwhelmed and killed and honestly
[13374.90 → 13380.74] yeah it's sad, and it's brutal, but it's like well framed and yes it's something that happens in a
[13380.74 → 13386.74] cut scene, but you like are absolutely overwhelmed, and you feel it before it happens and when the
[13386.74 → 13393.38] cut scene happens it's like yep this was going to happen like it was so it's like yeah it's its rough but it
[13393.38 → 13400.66] like it's properly rough it makes you feel and understand the rough it's not just this like out of nowhere
[13400.66 → 13408.90] poorly written dumb thing yeah and people reference the ending of that game like all the time as
[13408.90 → 13416.34] something that's really well written um yeah Jane halo reach everyone dies and everything is
[13416.34 → 13421.86] hopeless nine out of ten game yeah exactly like it can you can be super rough with something, but it's
[13421.86 → 13426.90] really well written so you care about it, and you're invested and all that kind of stuff and cool good
[13426.90 → 13431.78] yeah I don't mind when games kill off or movies or books or whatever I don't mind when they kill off
[13431.78 → 13441.22] characters I just think it should be worth it um and I find in a in a bunch of games in particular
[13441.22 → 13447.78] it's often like not I feel like it's done just to be edgy especially I find blizzard is an extremely
[13448.74 → 13454.18] bad example well they had a lot of perfect success with that yeah and then I think it just became
[13454.18 → 13460.34] like uh we're just going to do this by default yeah like art has or Kerrigan or which were both fantastic
[13460.34 → 13466.66] examples of it going well actually I don't think like does anyone uh like even art has killing his dad
[13467.70 → 13474.42] like okay yeah there wasn't a ton of blah blah blah, but that was a mechanic to show him losing it and
[13474.42 → 13480.10] like transitioning over all like it where it was good yeah it was written well it's its very memorable moment
[13480.10 → 13487.46] his dad doesn't like to have some crazy last stand or anything, but it's a very important point in the
[13487.46 → 13493.22] story it's not just like declared Cain is dead in a room, and you walk away like i I don't know and you
[13493.22 → 13500.98] also care right yeah you have to care I mean I cared when declared Cain was dead but I cared because I was
[13500.98 → 13507.22] mad because they did it so poorly instead of that's absolutely not what I meant i know
[13507.22 → 13512.34] but I'm I'm caveat that is the worst kind yeah yeah someone's going to say that in chat so I was
[13512.34 → 13517.94] getting ahead of it good uh let's see we've got one here for linus is it true that you can leap
[13517.94 → 13527.06] over a chair from the standing position no what well okay wait hold on what kind of chair yeah like
[13527.06 → 13533.70] one of those little tykes uh little tykes chairs it's a small probably folding chair uh okay well how
[13533.70 → 13537.22] what do you mean by leap like I could go head first over it no, no no, no you're going to like you're
[13537.22 → 13540.66] going to be standing, and you're going to jump over it, and then you're going to go back and also be standing
[13540.66 → 13546.58] absolutely no way I bet you wait what kind of chair I'm still like a folding chair you know
[13546.58 → 13553.06] chair yeah you know default chair what's a default chair I mean I couldn't do this chair no that's not
[13553.06 → 13559.06] a default what's it okay are you talking like a folding uh auditorium yeah sure yeah something like
[13559.06 → 13564.34] those like metal folding chairs there's no way I could do that you know how short I am right
[13566.02 → 13571.22] does that matter no I guess your vertical no vertical should be no, no yeah you would no longer
[13571.22 → 13575.78] legs you might be able to jump higher you have more time to apply a force I'm not I don't know
[13575.78 → 13582.82] the physics of jumping I think longer links uh legs helps with jumping yeah well i I am five six and
[13582.82 → 13588.66] my legs are short like I have I'm a stumpy leg five six like when we sit next to each other
[13589.30 → 13594.50] our height difference does not look like that much from our torsos how tall would it be here
[13595.30 → 13600.34] I have no idea I don't know I haven't even seen one of those in like a long time
[13604.18 → 13606.98] that's pretty high yeah
[13606.98 → 13618.74] no I feel like if you had a run like a standing jump is really hard uh you got you get about two
[13618.74 → 13623.46] steps but I mean you kind of I don't think you have like the sweater standing or steps you're just
[13623.46 → 13627.94] making things up as you go is this even a merch message or are you just trying to taunt Linus no
[13627.94 → 13632.90] no I don't know I don't think Linus looks enough like Bill Gates to be able to jump over a chair
[13636.34 → 13642.10] what is this reference Bill Gates jumping over a chair is that an is that it's a thing yeah okay
[13642.10 → 13646.82] that's what the message was talking about I don't know it's okay well hold on a second oh way too high
[13646.82 → 13652.18] apparently I was yeah I was probably too high hold on Bill Gates google it could you jump on the
[13652.18 → 13658.26] table is this just like a thing that we can find yeah what really happened when Bill Gates jumped the
[13658.26 → 13669.38] chair oh I see I've become obsessed with this video um okay so wait hold on where's the video
[13669.38 → 13675.94] okay so just hold on depends on the size of the chair
[13680.82 → 13682.82] okay, but it's its below his waist
[13687.62 → 13693.06] that's quite the jump but first the position of the chair matters because if you're
[13693.06 → 13698.90] jumping over the back of the chair I think it's going to be harder um, and he jumped over the front of it
[13700.34 → 13706.58] and also it's its uh I think it's shorter than I expected okay
[13710.10 → 13715.30] that is quite the jump though never jumped the chair what am I what am I looking
[13715.30 → 13720.02] have you seen the video I have the video on my screen I clearly need to watch this here
[13729.38 → 13737.54] okay
[13737.54 → 13742.34] I don't know moving on
[13745.78 → 13748.74] they're just the most confused people I've ever seen
[13748.74 → 13753.30] I don't know yeah exclusive of lines trying to jump over
[13755.30 → 13763.86] they don't have a helmet on yeah hello ls versus LL arm wrestle live on wan Luke's size uh
[13765.14 → 13771.78] known strength versus Linus's badminton conditioning and honey badger determination I'll do it but my honey
[13771.78 → 13775.70] badger determination is going to do nothing for me, I'm going to get absolutely crushed here watch this
[13775.70 → 13779.94] here watch this just watch this hold on hold on watch this okay hold on okay
[13781.94 → 13788.34] what am I doing what's happening oh that's actually impressive okay, okay this is this man's forearm
[13788.34 → 13798.74] oh my god you know what I don't think we need to bother I don't need to get hurt right now
[13798.74 → 13807.94] I wouldn't hurt you destroy you just sit there like this maybe like drink some water
[13809.38 → 13810.50] have a conversation
[13812.90 → 13816.42] hello DLL my local I'm not big okay
[13820.02 → 13827.22] my local and only ISP switched to a pay per gig model my average bill for my family is now 278
[13827.22 → 13834.34] dollars have you explored what it would take to start an ISP like at a remote leg compound perhaps
[13834.34 → 13841.06] honestly at this point you like basically can't um you're just going to be piggybacking off of
[13841.06 → 13846.58] somebody else and at that point a decent amount of your price is going to be dictated by the market
[13846.58 → 13855.14] um so I don't know sorry if that's a really disappointing answer Linus what is your favourite
[13855.14 → 13858.18] Sancho snack
[13858.66 → 13865.22] I think uh available your most common one is ketchup chips yeah I think that's just because
[13865.22 → 13869.46] they're there though yeah like I would never buy ketchup chips they're just when they're there
[13869.46 → 13873.38] I'm all like ketchup chips and then I eat them and then I feel bad
[13873.38 → 13880.42] bad, but you had like three bags two two bags and I feel doubly bad
[13884.50 → 13890.90] hey guys just saw the new sci-fi movie the creator which inspires the question do you think uh which
[13890.90 → 13896.18] inspires this question do you think you'll see AI reach full sentience in your lifetimes and if you
[13896.18 → 13904.74] do you do would you be more excited or scared sentience it's so hard to define yeah solipsism
[13906.18 → 13907.22] who's alive really
[13909.78 → 13912.90] is your mic open yeah okay good um
[13914.66 → 13920.98] it just turns into philosophy at that point doesn't it yeah yeah I don't know um don't
[13920.98 → 13923.62] don't say that in flow plane chat that's evil
[13926.18 → 13932.26] what filthy Canadians and Lindy chips how dare you no, no you can't, you can't mention that I don't
[13932.26 → 13935.94] even know what you're talking about oh Rocco's basilisk no Luke what are you doing
[13938.26 → 13939.70] you don't want people going down rabbit holes
[13941.54 → 13947.06] what Dan what's going on you're dooming thousands of people to a future of hell and torment
[13947.06 → 13955.22] damn dude hey cold okay up next what it is what it is Luke why do you stream your Starfield
[13955.22 → 13961.14] gameplay on twitch and not on goat plane the superior live-streaming platform do you want
[13961.14 → 13964.74] yeah do you want me to be a creator on float plane I don't know okay I don't
[13966.66 → 13967.70] I only take quality
[13970.34 → 13975.30] I don't think you I don't think you have enough subscribers to do well on our platform I wouldn't
[13975.30 → 13981.14] but that that's actually a thing like I'm being I'm applying the same type of logic we would for
[13981.14 → 13986.66] for other creators technically I do have a channel on float plane, but it's like a development
[13986.66 → 13991.46] channel more or less um but I would not pull enough people for it to
[13991.46 → 13994.66] make a ton of sense just to be like completely honest um
[14000.26 → 14003.30] I don't know I also don't want accounting to have to deal with the like
[14003.30 → 14010.34] six dollars a month I'm going to be making like it just i don't think it makes a lot of sense
[14010.34 → 14016.66] um I don't take that offensively I don't want people I just realized we're talking about it right
[14016.66 → 14023.62] now um i I'm not very interested in promoting it much I don't really care about it, I don't even
[14023.62 → 14030.66] follow a schedule that they are bad quality streams I do not try to make them entertaining I'm
[14030.66 → 14035.94] literally just sitting there doing what I would do anyway um I don't even suggest that you watch
[14037.22 → 14042.26] there you go what a sales pitch yeah I don't turn the over psychology I don't even want that
[14042.26 → 14046.90] don't watch this stream you will actually be bored and just leave and that's fine with me
[14046.90 → 14052.98] to be completely honest all right speaking of bored and just leaving I'm out terrible sales pitch
[14052.98 → 14060.90] not dog days bye
[14065.54 → 14079.54] um
[14082.98 → 14112.96] Thank you.
