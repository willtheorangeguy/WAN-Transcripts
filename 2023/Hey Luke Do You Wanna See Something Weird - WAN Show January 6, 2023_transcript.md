[0.00 --> 4.00]  What is up everyone? How you doing? And welcome to the WAN Show!
[4.00 --> 12.00]  We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today. AMD boldly announces new Ryzen 7000 non-X and X3D chips
[12.00 --> 19.00]  while Intel quietly launches 16 13th gen CPUs to compete against them.
[19.00 --> 24.00]  With no reviews, no actual fanfare whatsoever.
[24.00 --> 27.00]  Alright. Very interesting choice. And different strategies.
[27.00 --> 32.00]  Also, hey Luke. Hey. Do you want to see some really weird stuff?
[32.00 --> 35.00]  Yeah. Because I have got some displays to show you.
[35.00 --> 39.00]  Don't look at them yet. We'll look at them later. What else we got today?
[39.00 --> 44.00]  Okay. Wizards of the Coast are being just jerks.
[44.00 --> 48.00]  That's all the info I'm gonna give you. Yeah, they're actual butthead wizards now.
[48.00 --> 52.00]  Yeah. Yeah, they're not welcome on our coast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[52.00 --> 60.00]  And what else? I told myself I was gonna pick one early, but I actually didn't do it.
[60.00 --> 63.00]  If he complains about the topics today. Oh, perfect.
[63.00 --> 68.00]  It'll be on me because unlike most WAN shows, I actually handpicked all the topics today.
[68.00 --> 70.00]  So come at me. Oh, did you? Come at me.
[70.00 --> 75.00]  No, no, no. Microsoft asked ChatGPT, how do I fix Bing and Windows search?
[75.00 --> 79.00]  Ooh, interesting. I wonder what the answer was.
[79.00 --> 104.00]  The show is brought to you today by Acer, The Ridge, and Squarespace.
[104.00 --> 108.00]  Why don't we jump right into our headline topic today.
[108.00 --> 114.00]  Hey, Luke. Look at these weird displays. Okay, you're not allowed. Don't look at anything. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[114.00 --> 115.00]  Okay. Okay. All right.
[115.00 --> 121.00]  Plenty of high resolution and high refresh rate monitors were unveiled at CES this year.
[121.00 --> 132.00]  But I want to show Luke the monitor technologies that require a little more justification than big and sharp and high refresh rate.
[132.00 --> 142.00]  We are going to have him play a little game where he tries to come up with some potential use case for any of this.
[142.00 --> 143.00]  Okay.
[143.00 --> 145.00]  Do you think you can do it? Are you ready?
[145.00 --> 149.00]  Yeah, I actually think I can. I don't know what any of the monitors are, but I'm sure I can think of something.
[149.00 --> 155.00]  We're going to start here. I'm just going to fire up my laptop sharing thing here. There you go. It's up there.
[155.00 --> 167.00]  We're going to start with ASUS Spatial Vision. That's right. This is a laptop with the world's first glasses-free 3D OLED technology.
[167.00 --> 168.00]  Okay. Okay. Okay.
[168.00 --> 177.00]  The way it works is it actually has a camera on the front of the laptop on the bezel that looks at where your eyes are.
[177.00 --> 185.00]  So rather I should say stereo cameras that look at where your eyes are and automatically readjusts the alignment of the image,
[185.00 --> 195.00]  which achieves stereo separation by splitting up every vertical line. So every other line is a right eye image and every other line is a left eye image.
[195.00 --> 199.00]  Okay. And you do not need 3D glasses.
[199.00 --> 205.00]  I think this one's pretty easy. I mean, there's lots of like 3D content. 3D movies.
[205.00 --> 206.00]  Is there?
[206.00 --> 207.00]  I, okay.
[207.00 --> 208.00]  Is there though?
[208.00 --> 209.00]  I might have to qualify.
[209.00 --> 213.00]  Are you sure that the year is not 2014?
[213.00 --> 218.00]  There's lots of old ones. Yeah. They made a bunch of old ones for a very short period of time.
[218.00 --> 223.00]  And maybe you haven't watched any of them because it was horrible back then and very not accessible back then.
[223.00 --> 226.00]  And now you can buy a specific laptop just to be able to see that.
[226.00 --> 231.00]  Are you sure that Nvidia even makes a stereo 3D driver anymore?
[231.00 --> 234.00]  Oh, that's interesting.
[234.00 --> 236.00]  But there's gotta be other ways.
[237.00 --> 239.00]  I'm sure if it's, it's a laptop, right?
[239.00 --> 243.00]  So I'm sure whatever they are powering the laptop with is able to display it.
[243.00 --> 245.00]  Okay. What would you do with it?
[245.00 --> 248.00]  I don't want it. I do nothing with it.
[248.00 --> 254.00]  I have no personal use case for this at all. This is stupid. There's no way I would buy that. No question.
[254.00 --> 256.00]  No question.
[256.00 --> 260.00]  All right. After Luke gives his answer, I'm gonna give the real answer.
[260.00 --> 261.00]  So...
[261.00 --> 264.00]  I'm assuming it has something to do with like architectural stuff.
[264.00 --> 275.00]  There are apparently 2D to 3D layers that you can apply to games to the point where you can play games that were not developed for stereoscopic 3D.
[275.00 --> 278.00]  In stereo 3D, it adds another camera view somehow.
[278.00 --> 279.00]  What games?
[280.00 --> 282.00]  Apparently modern ones. I have not tried it.
[282.00 --> 284.00]  This does not sound like it's gonna be every game.
[284.00 --> 286.00]  I have not personally tried it, sir.
[286.00 --> 287.00]  Okay.
[287.00 --> 289.00]  Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you, sir.
[289.00 --> 290.00]  Sir.
[290.00 --> 293.00]  I wouldn't try this with multiplayer games. You're probably gonna get banned.
[293.00 --> 296.00]  Okay, but more realistically, professional applications...
[296.00 --> 297.00]  Yeah.
[297.00 --> 302.00]  Where your boss comes to your desk. This is an alternative to throwing on a VR headset.
[302.00 --> 303.00]  Yeah.
[303.00 --> 307.00]  So, theoretically, I think... Ooh, don't quote me on this.
[307.00 --> 312.00]  No, it obviously wouldn't be able to attract two people at once. Okay, I don't know. Just ignore it.
[312.00 --> 317.00]  But the point is, if someone was at your desk, you could show them and manipulate a model...
[317.00 --> 318.00]  Build the side, whatever.
[318.00 --> 322.00]  And it could pop out or go behind the screen and they could really get a better sense of the scale.
[322.00 --> 323.00]  Like, say for example...
[323.00 --> 325.00]  Why is it a laptop?
[325.00 --> 330.00]  Just... Can you just... Help me out here, okay?
[330.00 --> 332.00]  Because, well, I guess the architectural thing, right?
[332.00 --> 335.00]  And I think that's kind of the direction that you're talking about right now.
[335.00 --> 337.00]  So, okay, yeah, professional, whatever.
[337.00 --> 338.00]  Sure.
[338.00 --> 343.00]  But then, like, literally the scenario that you're describing, there is zero benefit to it being a laptop.
[343.00 --> 356.00]  So, anyway, during the development of the screwdriver, say for example, if Alex could have modeled out at life size, you know, different handle shapes or something like that, that might have been pretty cool.
[356.00 --> 357.00]  Sure.
[357.00 --> 358.00]  That's the real answer.
[358.00 --> 359.00]  Yeah.
[359.00 --> 360.00]  All right, are you ready for number two?
[360.00 --> 361.00]  Sure.
[361.00 --> 365.00]  The Lenovo Think Plus Twist.
[365.00 --> 366.00]  Twist.
[368.00 --> 369.00]  Okay.
[369.00 --> 373.00]  ThinkBook Plus Reinvent's Rotating Design Form Factor.
[373.00 --> 375.00]  That's right, my friends.
[375.00 --> 384.00]  This guy has a high-resolution OLED panel on one side and an e-ink display on the other side.
[384.00 --> 386.00]  Uh...
[386.00 --> 388.00]  Wow.
[388.00 --> 392.00]  That sounds like a lot of easily damaged things that are hard to protect.
[392.00 --> 393.00]  Um...
[394.00 --> 396.00]  What is this for?
[396.00 --> 397.00]  Yeah.
[397.00 --> 398.00]  Whoa.
[398.00 --> 405.00]  Saving battery life if you're doing, uh, simple tasks that, that involve only, like, text editing or writing emails or something.
[405.00 --> 407.00]  Ooh, I like it.
[407.00 --> 408.00]  I like it.
[408.00 --> 410.00]  Because I'm assuming you can full turn off the other side, right?
[410.00 --> 412.00]  I believe you can, yes.
[412.00 --> 413.00]  Yeah.
[413.00 --> 415.00]  It comes with a pen that supports both displays.
[415.00 --> 417.00]  That's kind of cool.
[417.00 --> 425.00]  I think the main one, though, that they were focused on was, like, using it as an e-ink tablet, as, like, a reader.
[425.00 --> 426.00]  Yeah.
[426.00 --> 431.00]  Which you would only do, really, if you wanted to save battery life.
[431.00 --> 432.00]  Yeah.
[432.00 --> 435.00]  It also sounds like a very heavy e-reader.
[435.00 --> 436.00]  Yes.
[436.00 --> 438.00]  I don't know.
[438.00 --> 439.00]  Yeah.
[439.00 --> 440.00]  Okay.
[440.00 --> 441.00]  Yes.
[441.00 --> 442.00]  Next?
[442.00 --> 443.00]  Um...
[443.00 --> 444.00]  Okay.
[444.00 --> 446.00]  Gabe927 in Twitch chat says,
[446.00 --> 450.00]  I owned the original Twist and it was extremely unreliable.
[450.00 --> 451.00]  Okay.
[451.00 --> 452.00]  Fair enough.
[452.00 --> 453.00]  Uh, alright.
[453.00 --> 454.00]  Next up.
[454.00 --> 455.00]  Ooh, this is good.
[455.00 --> 457.00]  We've got a TV.
[457.00 --> 459.00]  It's a 4K TV.
[459.00 --> 460.00]  Okay.
[460.00 --> 461.00]  It's OLED.
[461.00 --> 462.00]  It's 4K?
[462.00 --> 463.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[463.00 --> 464.00]  4K.
[464.00 --> 465.00]  Lots of K's.
[465.00 --> 466.00]  New TV with 4K.
[466.00 --> 467.00]  4K's.
[467.00 --> 468.00]  4K's.
[468.00 --> 469.00]  It's OLED.
[469.00 --> 470.00]  It's higher than last gen OLED.
[470.00 --> 471.00]  Okay.
[471.00 --> 474.00]  Um, it's 97 inches.
[474.00 --> 475.00]  That's a lot.
[475.00 --> 477.00]  Which is a lot of inches.
[477.00 --> 486.00]  But, the big, the big wow factor feature of this display is that it is wireless.
[486.00 --> 487.00]  Um, hold on.
[487.00 --> 488.00]  Hold on.
[488.00 --> 489.00]  Hold on.
[489.00 --> 490.00]  Hold on.
[490.00 --> 491.00]  Hold on.
[491.00 --> 492.00]  Hold on.
[492.00 --> 493.00]  Do you know?
[493.00 --> 494.00]  Wait, like entirely?
[494.00 --> 496.00]  Do you know the Samsung One Connect box?
[496.00 --> 497.00]  No.
[497.00 --> 498.00]  Okay.
[498.00 --> 503.38]  Basically, Samsung has this super slim cable that you can wire up your wall, and that carries
[503.38 --> 507.82]  power and display, and then this box that you can have in your media console that has
[507.82 --> 512.82]  all your HDMI inputs and, you know, your optical connection, you know, ethernet, whatever,
[512.82 --> 513.82]  whatever else.
[513.82 --> 514.82]  Yeah.
[514.82 --> 515.82]  Yeah.
[515.82 --> 516.82]  So, how do you know the Xbox?
[516.82 --> 519.82]  Well, LG is kicking that up a notch with the zero connect box.
[519.82 --> 521.28]  How do they deliver power?
[521.28 --> 522.28]  It...
[522.28 --> 523.28]  Okay.
[523.28 --> 524.28]  Why?
[524.28 --> 526.00]  Why you gotta be an asshole?
[526.00 --> 527.04]  Well, I'm just...
[527.04 --> 528.76]  You're saying it's, it's cable-less.
[528.76 --> 529.76]  Okay.
[529.76 --> 538.70]  The box, the zero connect box, wirelessly transmits 120HZ 4K video with, they apparently haven't
[538.70 --> 541.78]  measured it, very low latency.
[541.78 --> 543.30]  They haven't measured it.
[543.30 --> 549.78]  is complete crap there is no way they haven't measured it i actually i would i don't make bets
[549.78 --> 555.62]  i guarantee you they have measured it there is no possibility where they have not measured it
[555.62 --> 559.46]  i'm sure they just don't want to report it it supports g-sync that's cool
[560.02 --> 564.82]  okay how does it receive power from the wall what the heck
[568.26 --> 573.22]  i don't if you're sending one k i can understand okay i'm sending one cable that's a lot better
[573.22 --> 579.86]  than like 15 if you're talking about like a computer or something sending one cable compared to two is
[579.86 --> 585.06]  not a problem i actually don't care about this don't forget that the samsung one connect is one
[585.06 --> 593.62]  cable oh that's way worse for this okay one justification i will give you the one possible
[593.62 --> 598.34]  justification a this is part of their signature line i don't think they expect to sell a ton of
[598.34 --> 604.42]  them i hope not and b don't be a dick they might want to measure that latency first before they do
[604.42 --> 613.06]  that and b okay a potential use case for this this could be the the actual viable version of the video
[613.06 --> 619.22]  we did earlier this week with the wireless gpu wireless gpu yeah so you can have it's a 97 inch tv
[619.78 --> 626.50]  that is basically like theater size and if you could have your connection box in a cabinet on the side of
[626.50 --> 632.34]  the room or at the back of the room or whatever and all your consoles and all your other crap is over there
[632.34 --> 635.94]  and all you need is power it could make for a very clean install
[637.94 --> 642.98]  but you can afford a theater room and a signature tv so you can probably afford a drywaller
[644.02 --> 650.50]  so like just run one of the cables cut a hole in the wall and embed a cable in the wall i will say for this one i will give them a prop
[650.50 --> 655.70]  a prop it's a cool like progression of technology sure it just doesn't matter because you're still
[655.70 --> 664.74]  sending a power cable yes but it could matter in the future in some other device or once if they figure
[664.74 --> 672.58]  out like high high uh high whatever wireless power etc sure something high wattage yeah yeah i don't know
[672.58 --> 680.34]  all right i got another one for you this is the lenovo yoga book 9i okay i like yoga books that's it
[682.02 --> 682.50]  that's it
[685.62 --> 691.78]  wow how does that not flip over does it have a stand in the back it does have an included kickstand yes
[691.78 --> 700.42]  is it like big i mean i guess i can't even see oh no that's oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah here we go here we go
[700.42 --> 713.06]  um wow okay interesting wow it can go into a lot so does it do the how does this work does this oh
[713.06 --> 720.58]  because this fell asleep that happens is that you yeah way to go luke oh
[723.46 --> 728.18]  if my laptop screen turns turns off oh the hdmi stops grabbing the audio
[728.18 --> 731.70]  ah so it starts out putting through the speakers got it solved uh so
[733.30 --> 736.66]  ah i'm having a hard time understanding how it works do the screens come off
[737.22 --> 741.22]  the keyboard definitely comes off okay yeah so that's how you get into the other
[741.22 --> 745.94]  configurations so the keyboard just like sits on the bottom screen it's two screens that clamshell together
[746.74 --> 754.50]  yeah yeah so you can put the keyboard here and use some screen as like a wrist rest okay so to like
[754.50 --> 760.10]  move the laptop around like i want to throw it in my bag yes you close the screens together yes
[760.66 --> 767.22]  the keyboard is off you put the whole like two-piece unit into your bag and then move i don't hate it
[768.42 --> 772.50]  i didn't ask if you hate it i asked what you would use it there's definitely use cases for a dual screen
[772.50 --> 777.54]  laptop sure um like i don't know that's not i don't think that's uh even worth going through all
[777.54 --> 781.54]  of them there's lots of things that you could use two screens for okay um some of the configurations
[781.54 --> 785.78]  were a little funny i think that one where you have them both vertical like you have to i didn't
[785.78 --> 790.34]  really see something in any of the product photos that's going to hold that up um i see a lot of
[790.34 --> 798.18]  flipped yoga laptops just flopping all over the place but when they had them both um like the format
[798.18 --> 803.62]  was in portrait they had them both like that that actually kind of made more sense to me that's pretty
[803.62 --> 807.22]  cool i could see that being pretty cool for like development or something like that i could see this
[807.22 --> 811.78]  being like an actual thing that people actually buy all right you ready for the next one yes there
[811.78 --> 817.14]  were a lot of wild display concepts at ces this year it's fun when they do that i should say there are
[817.14 --> 820.90]  ces is still on flex hybrid flex hybrid
[820.90 --> 830.82]  these things that are all right
[830.82 --> 840.90]  what's going on here is this a phone what is it what is it supposed to is it a tablet you tell me luke i don't know
[840.90 --> 850.10]  it looks like it's supposed to be a phone like the camera in the corner looked like a phone camera
[851.38 --> 856.10]  um okay do you want to see it again do you want to see it again yeah yeah okay here we go here we go
[856.10 --> 858.26]  we'll see it again like that looked like a phone thing
[862.26 --> 862.58]  why
[862.58 --> 870.34]  but look there's all the styles over here sure no one's ever going to make specific apps for this
[870.34 --> 872.10]  by the way whoever came up with that
[874.90 --> 881.54]  okay so it's the same as like your phone but it's really big and also you can make it really bigger
[882.82 --> 890.18]  um again this feels like cool technology but i don't think that device itself matters if that makes
[890.18 --> 896.50]  sense okay and we've seen all of that before we've seen like where it kind of rolls out more screen when you pull on it
[896.50 --> 898.66]  i don't think we've seen them together
[899.30 --> 904.50]  correct i don't think we have i'm just saying the individual pieces we have seen before oh there's more from samsung
[904.58 --> 909.78]  oh great very good samsung display i should clarify slidable flex yes
[911.30 --> 913.46]  i actually like this luke reacts channel
[913.46 --> 924.74]  okay so what okay again what is this is it supposed to be a display it's the slidable flex solo right
[924.74 --> 929.78]  but like i see a game on it that looks like the new knee for speed unbound potentially um
[931.54 --> 936.66]  is it plugged into a computer no it's it's so it's a tablet i'd say it's a tablet
[936.66 --> 954.02]  okay this is weird how the app the the how it's being used right now is really weird i guess it's just playing a video yeah
[954.74 --> 959.46]  sure of someone using it yes it's not actually in use i mean this is kind of neat
[959.46 --> 966.42]  i guess i don't know i wouldn't want it that's not the question luke the question is what could you use it for
[966.42 --> 971.54]  i mean it's just a tablet that gets bigger so it's it's probably easier to carry around especially if
[971.54 --> 975.30]  you're not carrying around a backpack so you're carrying around like a purse and you find that
[975.30 --> 981.62]  this can fit in there but then you can make it make it bigger things that you can make bigger go in there
[981.62 --> 987.78]  okay yeah they can what about this thing you can make bigger what is this slidable flex
[990.42 --> 998.02]  oh so it just goes both directions it's even bigger it's the bigger wrist it's the it's the bigger
[998.02 --> 1005.70]  raider are these are they actually planning on selling these okay are they just like you kind of
[1005.70 --> 1011.06]  you kind of hit the nail on the head okay this is samsung display okay so it's like a technology
[1011.06 --> 1019.22]  division it's not samsung electronics got it so this is and luke didn't know so it's fortunate he
[1019.22 --> 1024.98]  didn't say anything too rude uh but we actually have a sponsored video on these coming out very
[1024.98 --> 1031.06]  soon um the tech is cool these are tech demos and it looks they're all tech demos from from that
[1031.70 --> 1037.94]  which is not fair they look well i'd say they look better done than the versions of this that we've
[1037.94 --> 1043.78]  seen in the past i think that's fair to say but they aren't cooked yeah and they're not intended to be
[1043.78 --> 1050.18]  yeah these are tech demos and that's that makes sense but they're pretty wild it's cool i could
[1050.82 --> 1057.06]  the both directions or one direction thing doesn't really matter to me but a a tablet that expands i
[1057.06 --> 1062.50]  totally understand that makes sense i've never been a tablet person but the tablet people that i know
[1062.50 --> 1067.54]  would probably like that you know it's funny i'm actually the opposite way um they had a lot more
[1067.54 --> 1071.06]  things that they showed off that will be in the video guys make sure you don't miss it because
[1071.06 --> 1078.58]  their just their displays demo this year was wild that was not all of it for real um in the tablet
[1078.58 --> 1083.22]  form factor there was actually one that i liked better they have uh i forget what i forget what
[1083.22 --> 1089.14]  it's called the corners go out or something it folds in two spots oh so it's like a 12 inch tablet
[1089.14 --> 1095.38]  like a big old tablet like one of the like the big ipad pros yeah yeah but it folds twice with no
[1095.38 --> 1100.58]  display on the outside it's kind of nice so it's like kind of percival you know yeah yeah and i was
[1100.58 --> 1109.38]  a percival tablet that gets big totally makes sense yeah and for me i actually preferred the idea of
[1109.38 --> 1116.98]  having it fold up and be protected compared to the idea of like it having this no i agree presumably
[1116.98 --> 1123.22]  somewhat fragile rolling mechanism that takes a while it should be noted though that it doesn't take that
[1123.22 --> 1130.42]  long those are motorized demo units that makes sense but what's really cool is that james who i was
[1130.42 --> 1137.70]  kind of envious of this as far as i can tell other than samsung display employees james strive was the
[1137.70 --> 1141.94]  only person who was allowed to touch all of these that's pretty cool so he got in there and was like
[1141.94 --> 1149.14]  right right right right like they're they're manual the demos that you see are just motors so they're
[1149.14 --> 1153.38]  set up to manual mechanisms and when you're doing a display like that you're going to want to make it
[1153.38 --> 1156.82]  go pretty slow because people are going to be interested in like intricate things that you want
[1156.82 --> 1161.38]  to see at slow speed so i don't blame them for doing any of that but in use you would just open it
[1161.38 --> 1167.30]  yeah which is pretty cool yeah yeah i do i do think i agree with you i like the the dual folding one a
[1167.30 --> 1171.94]  little bit better it feels like you're folding like a piece of paper or a map or something like that
[1171.94 --> 1179.22]  that yeah makes sense tyler bolin one's first ever chat on twitch it's a grower not a shower yeah
[1180.50 --> 1185.06]  yeah that's a good first chat not always bad okay good first chat it gets bigger i swear um
[1186.50 --> 1191.14]  uh also that that's that's the last that's the last one not a small tab okay we're good for you to
[1191.14 --> 1197.94]  react to okay um but in other news it's a really good thing that i didn't buy of the wall
[1197.94 --> 1206.82]  because there's now a smaller version of the wall um it's not exactly petite it's 76 inches
[1207.62 --> 1218.42]  it's cheaper and get this they'll do 240 hertz now they are much brighter and the this is the big one
[1218.42 --> 1227.78]  the response time of this panel is apparently two nanoseconds whoa two nanoseconds
[1227.94 --> 1235.70]  for comparison you know it's fun when you move to a new unit of measurement you moved past we went
[1235.70 --> 1241.54]  from milliseconds to what i mean what's 0.1 of a millisecond i think that's what would what would
[1241.54 --> 1248.98]  that be yeah oh man i i'm pretty sure nano is under micro i think we went past an entire
[1248.98 --> 1257.70]  what order of magnitude just skipped over it the fact that the fact that oleds like high-end oled
[1257.70 --> 1265.94]  displays now are rated for like 0.1 milliseconds and this is two nanoseconds means that essentially
[1266.82 --> 1276.74]  image uh image retention or like image image blur is solved at this point like if you could put a micro led
[1276.74 --> 1283.70]  display in something like a vr headset you would have absolutely no smearing whatsoever now obviously
[1283.70 --> 1288.98]  the fact that they're only able to make this in like a 76 inch form factor means we're not getting
[1288.98 --> 1296.58]  vr headsets anytime soon yeah yeah one uh one fun thing when when you in the audience because i think i
[1296.58 --> 1304.10]  think i am too old for this when you in the audience turn 31.7 years old uh you can you can say that you are
[1304.10 --> 1310.90]  one giga second old and that's apparently real oh okay thank you for that luke yeah no worries i
[1310.90 --> 1316.10]  appreciate you it's like a ton of seconds but it's a giga no it's a giga of seconds it's not a ton
[1317.06 --> 1319.46]  measure of mass that makes sense yeah yeah good
[1322.26 --> 1328.26]  okay uh you guys are probably noticing if you are a new viewer there's little messages coming down in
[1328.26 --> 1333.38]  the bottom the way to send a message into the show is not through super chats it is not through twitch bits
[1333.38 --> 1338.58]  it is by either being subscribed on float plane we do actually monitor the float plane chat more
[1338.58 --> 1344.42]  closely or by sending in a merch message that's right instead of just throwing money at the screen
[1344.42 --> 1350.66]  you can throw money at the screen and get some cool stuff in the mail whether it's a t-shirt or a cool
[1350.66 --> 1357.70]  hoodie or a screwdriver it'll arrive eventually i swear it um a water bottle ltdstore.com is the place to go
[1357.70 --> 1362.18]  and in the checkout you can leave a merch message which will either show up along the bottom uh get a response from
[1362.18 --> 1367.38]  uh get a response from our producer dan or we might even talk about whatever it is that you said
[1367.38 --> 1374.74]  on the show uh sup hayden f just yeah shouting out picked up the backpack very nice backpack reviews so
[1374.74 --> 1379.38]  good yeah so yeah it's moving moving real good people are loving it speaking of monetization
[1380.02 --> 1387.62]  wizards of the coast titans dnd open gaming license angering community i think angering community is a bit
[1387.62 --> 1391.94]  of an understatement but yeah sure mild understatement this is not a community that tends to
[1391.94 --> 1399.22]  uh be be big on anger or or know how to combat things or write very well so i'm sure this won't be
[1399.22 --> 1404.82]  terrible for them a leaked version of wizards of the coast new open gaming license revision for dungeons
[1404.82 --> 1411.14]  and dragons is causing massive customer backlash luckily it's leaked not just customers to fix it massive
[1411.14 --> 1416.50]  backlash from everyone from everyone yeah because it's terrible uh the new revision demands that
[1416.50 --> 1422.50]  anyone making money really feel that anyone making money from dnd to directly report it to wizards of the
[1422.50 --> 1431.78]  coast and potentially pay a 25 percent royalty on gross revenue okay that's important that last bit is
[1431.78 --> 1440.74]  really important i think that many people do not really um maybe they just don't really think about
[1440.74 --> 1448.10]  all the different terms that businesses use to describe money okay so for example um i mentioned on a
[1448.10 --> 1458.10]  recent wan show that this year uh 2023 could be the first year that merch outpaces uh video production
[1458.10 --> 1464.90]  for linus media group or whatever the you know ivan umbrella corporation but for our revenue that does
[1464.90 --> 1470.82]  not mean and i've seen a lot of people that have sort of misconstrued that to mean that merch is more
[1470.82 --> 1478.82]  profitable that ain't the case physical goods have much higher overhead expenses you gotta ship it around
[1478.82 --> 1486.34]  you gotta make it you gotta r d it yada yada yada revenue is a measure of the of the sheer top line number
[1486.34 --> 1494.58]  of dollars that come into your company but there are there there are a few different places where
[1494.58 --> 1502.26]  revenue gets kind of cut down to become the actual amount left at the end uh so let's start first with
[1502.26 --> 1511.22]  that your with your with your cogs your like your cost of goods sold okay so when i bring in 70 of revenue
[1511.22 --> 1519.14]  on a screwdriver i then get to subtract the actual cost of my of my screwdriver so now i'm left with
[1519.14 --> 1529.14]  my gross profit not gross like you icky but gross like um not not the opposite of net yeah yeah okay so
[1529.14 --> 1535.46]  i'm left with my gross profit so that's essentially the amount of money minus the cost of goods sold but
[1535.46 --> 1542.98]  my costs aren't done yet to calculate my net profit okay the amount that i actually made on the
[1542.98 --> 1548.98]  screwdriver i then need to subtract any associated costs so we have to pack this thing somebody has to
[1548.98 --> 1554.34]  do that they need to be paid we have to put it in a box that costs money whoever made the box has to be
[1554.34 --> 1561.78]  paid um there's going to be some there's going to be qc uh there's also going to be some general overhead
[1561.78 --> 1565.86]  that's not necessarily associated with just this screwdriver but with screwdrivers in general we
[1565.86 --> 1570.74]  might have some bad units once in a while we need to send out replacement units via the trust me bro
[1570.74 --> 1576.90]  guarantee r d there's the r d that gets to be amortized but certainly has to be paid for at some
[1576.90 --> 1584.66]  point so then we get to our net profit then when we're done with that um now i'm gonna get a little
[1584.66 --> 1588.50]  bit fuzzy on the terms because i don't believe it or not actually work in our accounting department
[1588.50 --> 1593.54]  and we have to pay taxes on that profit and that's where we're left with i forget if it's like
[1593.54 --> 1598.50]  earnings or like like whatever net earnings or whatever the actual difference is so don't worry
[1598.50 --> 1601.86]  too much about the terms the point is you've got your revenue you've got your growth profit you've
[1601.86 --> 1608.90]  got your uh your profit after you account for uh paying salaries and uh operating costs electricity for
[1608.90 --> 1614.42]  your building and all that other stuff and then finally on that number that amount that was left
[1614.42 --> 1620.90]  over in your bank account you then get to write a big fat check to uncle trudeau and then that's
[1620.90 --> 1625.62]  the money that you actually get to keep sort of because that's your court we've played corporate
[1625.62 --> 1630.02]  income tax on that but if i wanted to actually spend it i would then have to pay personal income tax
[1630.02 --> 1638.74]  on it after i issued a dividend to myself or whatever the case may be okay cool so 25 royalty let's
[1638.74 --> 1647.30]  come back to wizards of the coast is on gross revenues that's why this is so nasty because it
[1647.30 --> 1652.74]  doesn't matter if you made any money even so you might have lost money and then need to give them they
[1652.74 --> 1661.62]  will take their cut and really and so say say you didn't make money on it say you lost money on it and
[1661.62 --> 1669.62]  then they came gave you the finger and took 25 of the original amount anyways and that also gives
[1669.62 --> 1675.78]  them free reign to use those works in any way they see fit without compensating in perpetuity in any
[1675.78 --> 1683.86]  way forever and they can even sub license it heck yeah really the previous version of the license was
[1683.86 --> 1690.18]  in place for more than 20 years and allowed broad royalty-free use of dnd's game mechanics and helped
[1690.18 --> 1696.42]  the tabletop rpgs grow into the 2.5 million dollar industry that they are today i actually bet you if
[1696.42 --> 1702.34]  that wasn't in place for the 20 years that it was in place they wouldn't be nowhere near the size of
[1702.34 --> 1706.90]  company that they are now um and i don't think it would be anywhere near as ubiquitous as it is now
[1706.90 --> 1713.86]  either yeah the previous ver uh sorry the new version does not allow for anything beyond game books and
[1713.86 --> 1720.82]  pdfs this eliminates videos virtual tabletop implementations kind of huge computer games
[1720.82 --> 1727.78]  also kind of huge novels apps graphic novels music and any other form of media from being created with
[1727.78 --> 1736.42]  the ip here's the really wild thing to me um the old license was perpetual
[1736.42 --> 1745.54]  so the new the new license um luke and i think both read up on this before coming into the show the
[1745.54 --> 1752.34]  new license specifically has language in it that allows them to alter the deal at any point pray i don't
[1752.34 --> 1758.74]  alter it further but the old one didn't i suspect if you created something already using the old license
[1758.74 --> 1764.02]  that you're probably still fine yeah but like i gotta imagine that are they just are they just
[1764.02 --> 1768.98]  anticipating that nobody will have the money or time to challenge them on this because the the
[1768.98 --> 1773.38]  original usually how these things work the original timeline for this had it going into effect in like
[1773.38 --> 1780.26]  two days from now or something like that like these people were basically being given no time to agree
[1780.90 --> 1787.54]  comply and move forward with these new license terms which is wild you've gone and you've built this
[1787.54 --> 1795.38]  ecosystem that is thriving you're clearly doing fine okay wizards of the coast brought in almost a billion
[1795.38 --> 1803.14]  dollars of revenue last year that is more than a third of the industry's revenue you are fine you have
[1803.14 --> 1811.94]  this openness to thank for your growth and now what some bean counter who i promise has never even
[1811.94 --> 1819.06]  touched dnd has no idea how important third-party contributions are to the ecosystem came in and
[1819.06 --> 1829.22]  said well why not no we should get money from this yeah why not brutal meanwhile hasbro and wizards of
[1829.22 --> 1833.78]  the coast are already dealing with significant backlash from the magic the gathering community over
[1833.78 --> 1839.62]  over printing cards bank of america devalued the stock last month after their research analyst came to
[1839.62 --> 1847.62]  the conclusion that the over printing was destroying the long-term value of the mtg brand yikes this
[1847.62 --> 1854.34]  ain't gonna help guys your brand is everything people don't have to play dungeons and dragons do you know
[1854.34 --> 1860.98]  how many games there are to play do you know how tabletop games do you know how passionate the tabletop
[1860.98 --> 1869.14]  gaming community is yeah they'll make a new one and they can trust me they can like do you know how
[1869.14 --> 1877.78]  easy it is to make a definitely not dungeons and definitely not dragons game it's a dice fantasy game
[1878.66 --> 1889.06]  it's like elves and you didn't invent that for real though yeah like really yeah do you have any idea
[1889.06 --> 1897.38]  what you're doing i'm not even hyper into dnd but i'm still looking at this going this is classic this is
[1897.38 --> 1905.78]  classic having absolutely no idea out of touch parent company absolutely no idea what you're doing yeah
[1905.78 --> 1911.86]  yeah yeah this is great we're getting lots of suggestions here uh we've got caves and lizards jails and
[1911.86 --> 1922.34]  wyverns huts huts and lizards this is what i'm talking this is what i'm talking about right now this 25
[1922.34 --> 1927.30]  is a great royalty okay wizards of the coast estimates that only about 20 companies will be
[1927.30 --> 1933.46]  affected by it and from their point of view why should they be essentially funding competitors
[1934.10 --> 1941.46]  but that's the thing is again you're you are missing the forest for the trees here i had never heard of
[1941.46 --> 1947.62]  any of those other companies until this headline hit my google news feed and that's what i was kind of
[1947.62 --> 1954.34]  referencing near the beginning is like all i knew was dungeons and dragons dnd is the is the is the big
[1954.34 --> 1961.86]  game in the space yeah you're the kleenex yeah so why are you coming out and starting a media war
[1961.86 --> 1969.06]  a community war in front of everybody with every other brand of nose tissue all you're doing is like
[1969.06 --> 1973.86]  expo to use terms that maybe someone in your community might understand but i suspect you won't
[1973.86 --> 1979.70]  you're exposing part of your armor and allowing another smaller group to take a massive shot
[1979.70 --> 1985.30]  because like if somebody if somebody if somebody in this community that makes a really good compelling
[1985.30 --> 1992.66]  product which there are genuinely many um just uses this to get a massive leg up it's very likely going
[1992.66 --> 2000.66]  to work like you're gonna get wrecked because there are other very compelling products but right now or
[2000.66 --> 2006.58]  before today i guess if someone is really into dnd and they play for a really long time they might
[2006.58 --> 2013.14]  keep playing dnd or maybe they go and play one of these other things right okay well they're still in
[2013.14 --> 2019.30]  that community and that person is still bringing interest from other people in their sphere into these
[2019.30 --> 2025.14]  types of things and i find no get out of here i do not want to restart right now obviously um this
[2025.14 --> 2030.18]  computer is on for one day a week all right i'm using it for one day a week it's actually on for longer
[2030.18 --> 2035.46]  than that um anyways they're bringing more people into the space and a lot of people when they come
[2035.46 --> 2043.78]  into the tabletop rpg space are going to default to dnd of course they are they're not going to default
[2043.78 --> 2050.34]  to one of these other games because they've heard this forever armor and shot no i was using i was
[2050.34 --> 2057.22]  talking about expose armor lumilia sin floatplane chat says it was very very clear from the from the leaks
[2057.22 --> 2063.54]  um that wizards of the coast has already already knows to expect backlash and they're just accepting
[2063.54 --> 2067.62]  that as cost of doing business i can't even imagine this is going to be a significant amount of money
[2068.42 --> 2077.30]  uh it could be it could be because that that 25 percent tier is at 750 000 of revenue per year
[2077.30 --> 2082.82]  and so if there's 20 of them well that's at least 15 million dollars so you could take 25 of 15 million
[2082.82 --> 2087.14]  dollars it wouldn't hurt but then again we're talking about at the scale of their business like
[2087.14 --> 2092.66]  why and they're creating so much administrative red tape yeah for what like everyone's expected to
[2092.66 --> 2097.30]  report their projects in to wizards of the coast someone has to review all that remember we were
[2097.30 --> 2101.46]  talking about those financial breakdown things yeah now you have to factor in the revenue loss that
[2101.46 --> 2105.78]  they're going to have and i guarantee you they're going to have it this is a very passionate community
[2105.78 --> 2110.50]  and they are not going to like this so they're going to switch to other games and some of these
[2110.50 --> 2115.22]  other games or platforms they included like music whatever else some of these other things various
[2115.22 --> 2121.86]  forms of implementation they can pivot assuming that their previous works fall under the original
[2121.86 --> 2128.50]  license so they're still fine new works can pivot tommy blue uh clarified something yes sorry i'm sorry
[2129.22 --> 2138.10]  if you are doing 750 plus uh 750 000 plus revenue it's 25 on anything past that so it's kind of like a um
[2139.06 --> 2144.58]  bloody hell i forget the word um like it's kind of like how tax brackets work so yes you're in the
[2144.58 --> 2149.14]  higher bracket but that bracket only applies to your personal income over whatever level someone in chat is
[2149.14 --> 2157.22]  talking about using uh chat gpt to alter how dnd works to make a new game like yeah i don't know if you're
[2157.22 --> 2163.46]  make if you're making stuff in this space and your company uh if your company's revenue is over 750
[2163.46 --> 2169.06]  grand and you're making something in this space first off good job second off i pivot find a way
[2169.06 --> 2174.50]  i'm sure you can do it screw these guys don't give them that 25 by the way i took some fun ones from
[2174.50 --> 2179.62]  float planes some some potential names for dnd competitors okay uh we've got swamps and donkey
[2179.62 --> 2190.18]  uh we've got planes and snakes nice okay um basements and virgins that that could be an actual game
[2190.18 --> 2196.26]  uh yeah i know right that could actually totally be an actual game but like the adventure is like
[2196.26 --> 2200.42]  getting out of the basement yeah trying to accomplish your fairly obvious task
[2200.42 --> 2210.58]  there's various ways to do so i mean wasn't that just super bad yeah basically exactly there's a
[2210.58 --> 2213.94]  compelling story here you could make that game coming of age
[2219.86 --> 2220.98]  that's the expansion
[2220.98 --> 2231.94]  and then the so to round out the trilogy we've got fun for the whole family oh no what no because
[2231.94 --> 2240.26]  because you've had children where did you go with that disgusting disgusting get your mind out of the
[2240.26 --> 2242.98]  gutters sir get out of the gutter step bro uh
[2242.98 --> 2243.70]  uh
[2249.06 --> 2251.94]  no that's the fourth one oh there you go okay yeah yeah yeah
[2255.54 --> 2264.42]  all right um cool oh man anyway uh we do not support this yeah if you didn't gather that
[2266.26 --> 2271.70]  okay apparently our discussion question here was how could hasbro monetize two of the most lucrative
[2271.70 --> 2277.62]  brands in the gaming world without completely alienating their users uh i mean i can tell
[2277.62 --> 2282.98]  you right now that all the references to nfts in the new guidelines are not gonna help
[2284.18 --> 2290.66]  yeah oh you're a little late to the grift guys yeah a little bit there's tons of ways i don't know
[2291.62 --> 2297.30]  yeah anyway uh i always found that their games were very uh half-assed
[2297.30 --> 2303.78]  like the dnd video games were never really that great i remember the first time i ever heard that
[2303.78 --> 2309.22]  there was a dnd video game i actually got really excited and then it was junk and i was like oh yeah
[2309.22 --> 2315.38]  i mean you don't actually have to make it the third party ones have been by far the the better
[2315.38 --> 2320.18]  respected ones yeah we're talking about like neverwinter nights or uh something that is less
[2320.18 --> 2326.50]  directly uh you know d and d e neverwinter nights was like legendary um balder's gate i believe
[2326.50 --> 2330.10]  started like that as well yeah it was before yeah winter nights like there there's quite a few that
[2330.10 --> 2335.06]  were done way better yeah so clearly it's possible yeah but i don't mean knights of the old republic
[2335.06 --> 2341.62]  another legendary game no absolutely not a first party game a lot of og video games were actually
[2341.62 --> 2346.82]  based on d and d like systems um every winter nights is technically a d and d game oh i didn't
[2346.82 --> 2352.66]  actually know that yeah is is it d and d though like was it first party because if so then what
[2352.66 --> 2360.90]  happened like for real though this bug is just like chilling with me for the whole show apparently
[2360.90 --> 2368.18]  baldur's gate 3 is coming yeah but it's made by um the the people that
[2368.18 --> 2377.38]  are we saying that as a plus for wizards of the coast because baldergate 3 is made by the company
[2377.38 --> 2381.94]  that made another game that i can't remember right now that is really really really good and i'm
[2381.94 --> 2387.70]  expecting dragon age or uh baldur's gate 3 is going to be fantastic uh larian studios yes larian studios
[2388.90 --> 2393.38]  ah what's the name of it the most previous game that they made was fanta divinity original sin 2.
[2393.38 --> 2398.42]  it's really good it's made by larian studios it's a fantastic game so i i have really high hopes for
[2398.42 --> 2406.26]  brawl the brothers gate 3. like very very high hopes all right let's hope for the best i have i
[2406.26 --> 2412.58]  have a on on record i have the soundtrack for the original sin 2 signed by the whole dev team
[2412.58 --> 2417.38]  not the whole dev team but a bunch of the dev team because at pax east the team was there so i brought
[2417.38 --> 2421.30]  the record and got them to sign it was pretty sweet that's very cool yeah yeah luke's been trying to get
[2421.30 --> 2426.82]  me to play it we uh we've done it we started a co-op um campaign we've made it as far as the
[2426.82 --> 2432.90]  tutorial we got off the boat yeah we got off the boat and then stopped yeah it it was fun though
[2432.90 --> 2437.78]  yes we just don't always have a ton of time and and we often want to play with your son and it's a
[2437.78 --> 2444.18]  little yeah i don't think he'd be quite there yet for enjoying that it's two player so no i thought it
[2444.18 --> 2449.86]  was four oh but we started a two-player game yeah so i think we'd have to make a new game i think
[2449.86 --> 2455.46]  yeah yeah and then expecting all three of those schedules to align i think is a little rough yeah
[2455.46 --> 2460.58]  the amount of divinity original sin 2 games that i have because of wanting to integrate a new person
[2460.58 --> 2464.66]  and they want to make their own character and stuff so you end up forking like a million times is
[2464.66 --> 2470.98]  is pretty crazy um but yeah fantastic game and as far as my understanding goes larian is a fantastic
[2470.98 --> 2475.94]  studio so uh apparently yeah baldur's gate is officially licensed dnd mind you that was a hot minute
[2475.94 --> 2482.18]  ago so hopefully hopefully that's going to change anyway in terms of ideas to monetize the ip clearly
[2482.18 --> 2488.98]  there are plenty and they don't have to just the fact that alienate their players gate three and it's
[2488.98 --> 2496.42]  being released now means they didn't take advantage of that yeah that's true like that's fair i don't know
[2496.42 --> 2504.90]  man i think there's lots of ways i'm also surprised has there been a movie g and d movie what would that
[2504.90 --> 2512.26]  even look like well like here's a yeah i don't know dungeons and dragons honor among thieves is
[2512.26 --> 2514.26]  apparently coming this year 23.
[2516.90 --> 2525.94]  hmm i could see this i could see it being great i could see it being terrible yeah yep i don't feel
[2525.94 --> 2531.14]  like it's going to land in the middle i think it's going to be atrocious or or great well hugh grant is in
[2531.14 --> 2536.34]  it is that a good thing or a bad thing i mean it's hugh grant so um i'm not very good with like it
[2536.34 --> 2540.50]  depends if you like his sort of likable awkwardness
[2544.18 --> 2550.42]  i feel like they need to kind of brush over that it's dnd you know apparently there was a horrible one
[2550.82 --> 2558.66]  um oh in 2000 dungeons and dragons imdb 2000 and i didn't even know about this
[2558.66 --> 2564.26]  well it has 3.6 stars out of 10 so it looks like you didn't really miss out on much yeah really
[2564.26 --> 2569.06]  but like the fact that i didn't know about it is rough at like 50 to 60 percent there's a chance
[2569.06 --> 2577.14]  that you'll just be like her dirt good movie uh at at 36 of people liked it yeah the odds are not
[2577.14 --> 2583.46]  looking good yep um if you want the odds of your message appearing down there to be high you're going
[2583.46 --> 2587.54]  to want to send in a merch message dan do you want to give us a couple and then we'll yeah we'll try and do
[2587.54 --> 2592.34]  the rest of the of the curated merch messages towards the end of the show sure that sounds good
[2593.14 --> 2598.82]  um let's see i've got one here from ashkay uh buying a bottle for my friend's birthday at linus
[2598.82 --> 2605.22]  how do you decide which videos go up on weekdays versus weekends depends when they're done
[2607.86 --> 2613.86]  nice and simple in a perfect world we'd actually love to come out with a banger on saturday just
[2613.86 --> 2621.62]  because friday's wan show and wan show doesn't like perform the same way that a typical vod does
[2621.62 --> 2626.26]  so we we'd love to be able to come out strong just so that you know algorithmically we're sending
[2626.26 --> 2633.70]  signals that we don't upload you know two uh wet farts in a row uh i'm google claims up and down that
[2633.70 --> 2641.46]  that doesn't matter but it like totally totally does um yeah uh okay everything at creator summit
[2641.46 --> 2650.10]  is confidential but i will just say youtube says a lot of things and the experienced creators do not
[2650.10 --> 2658.98]  appreciate the way that youtube tends to oversimplify how their algorithmic systems for deciding how a video
[2658.98 --> 2666.74]  is promoted work they are not simple and you do kind of need to be a bit of a a bit of a a of a
[2666.74 --> 2675.06]  of a fortune teller soothsayer tea leaf reader to even sort of maybe hopefully understand how they work
[2675.06 --> 2684.82]  and they are not just like yeah good video get views quite anywho um yeah but it doesn't usually work
[2684.82 --> 2690.18]  out that way though we do our best yeah and i got another one here from jacob hi linus and luke do
[2690.18 --> 2694.50]  you guys think floatplane will ever turn into a big streaming service for techies
[2696.02 --> 2702.02]  uh not in the way not like for techie it's not for techies um it's for everybody we have a lawyer on
[2702.02 --> 2709.70]  the platform well what's interesting is that the conversations that we've been having about new
[2709.70 --> 2716.26]  features and how floatplane could be utilized i guess so could make it a hugely important video
[2716.26 --> 2720.98]  streaming service for techies we want to talk about that but not in the way you're thinking
[2720.98 --> 2725.86]  at all yeah sure why don't we talk about it yeah sure you're about uh you're about to listen in on
[2725.86 --> 2731.38]  our weekly floatplane strategy and develop do we want to get do we want to talk about the the thing
[2731.38 --> 2739.62]  um this thing let's not talk about the that thing okay did you just go like this to me not quite okay
[2739.62 --> 2742.10]  there's more separation i guess i would have been able to tell yeah
[2745.30 --> 2751.86]  familiar um yeah there's there's some video features i'll just say it like that um that are
[2751.86 --> 2756.66]  are going to eventually be coming to the lab's website well we can talk about some basic ones like
[2756.66 --> 2762.26]  say for example like uh like uh keyboard videos like what what did antoine want to do with the
[2762.26 --> 2769.06]  video player again yeah so basically like a a video where you'd watch a key get pressed by the key
[2769.06 --> 2777.14]  presser um could be played on the site through by using by using floatplane um basically having a youtube
[2777.14 --> 2784.58]  embed would be cheap and i mean it would be free um and and easy but then we've all seen how that
[2784.58 --> 2788.66]  works where like you get the suggested videos being sent at the end of it and it doesn't really
[2788.66 --> 2792.58]  fit in with the rest of the flow of the website you can maybe customize the player but the second
[2792.58 --> 2796.26]  video ends and it spits out a bunch of suggested videos you you know it's not really part of the
[2796.26 --> 2801.54]  site and we might not want everything to be like a 16 by 9 aspect ratio we might want to
[2802.74 --> 2808.66]  we might want it and embedded a little more tightly with everything around it like there's a lot of
[2808.66 --> 2812.74]  reasons maybe use gifts and this doesn't exclude gifts but there might be situations where we want
[2812.74 --> 2817.94]  people to be able to have uh more control over the actual video or we might want to have our own
[2817.94 --> 2823.14]  player for whatever reason on it etc etc etc so yeah um there's there's potentially going to be flowplane
[2823.14 --> 2828.18]  integration extremely likely going to it's just not there yet let's just tell them about the cool
[2828.18 --> 2833.78]  feature you sure yeah let's just tell them this is like it's the kind of thing that obviously talking
[2833.78 --> 2840.18]  about it you know 6 12 18 months before we're ready to launch is gonna potentially give someone a
[2840.18 --> 2845.38]  heads up but realistically like what who's going to compete with this who could be done this feature
[2845.38 --> 2851.30]  in 18 months other than us i know if somebody could it would just be expensive well yeah but that's what
[2851.30 --> 2860.26]  i mean you totally could yeah but um lots of things i doubt anyone will do it um so you know how hard it is
[2860.26 --> 2870.34]  to find any kind of credible answer to this versus that you know some some gpu versus another gpu or some
[2870.34 --> 2877.38]  cpu versus another cpu sorry keep going i have something else to add to that but keep going sure
[2877.38 --> 2884.98]  i mean you usually end up on one of those websites that just kind of has a spec sheet that may or may not
[2884.98 --> 2890.66]  be accurate and maybe a little write-up uh but like it's like a generated write-up it's just it's
[2890.66 --> 2897.46]  just honestly not that useful um the solution to that up until now has been to search for it on youtube
[2897.46 --> 2903.70]  and there's this entire genre of videos now this entire category of videos that's just gameplay
[2903.70 --> 2910.26]  captures with frame time time information on it and stuff frame times clock speeds temperatures overlaid
[2910.26 --> 2916.10]  so that you can see the different products running next to each other the issue is that someone has to
[2916.10 --> 2922.10]  go capture that gameplay footage specifically for that video they have to stitch it together they have
[2922.10 --> 2925.46]  to encode it they have to upload it to youtube they have to title it and you have to find it
[2926.34 --> 2932.34]  well what if on the lab's website we had a comparison engine that gave you the specs obviously so you so
[2932.34 --> 2937.70]  you could compare the the specs the you know architecture clock speed you know kuda cores or whatever else
[2937.70 --> 2944.42]  the case may be but where you could also dynamically generate side-by-side video of whatever games you
[2944.42 --> 2949.86]  want to see of whatever cards you want to see and we had a custom player that could play them back so
[2949.86 --> 2955.38]  that you could really see the difference in gameplay experience like stitch it into one player so that
[2955.38 --> 2963.14]  it's a good experience and and whatnot um that's what we're building dan from the the labs web the dan the
[2963.14 --> 2968.82]  lead of the labs web team ran a a meeting today that was actually super cool we've done this with
[2968.82 --> 2973.30]  flowplane before uh but it was essentially like a site walkthrough where you sit the team down you go
[2973.30 --> 2977.30]  through the website and you get feedback from everybody about like how something feels does this
[2977.30 --> 2981.78]  work in the way we want it to should we change this thing whatever you go through the whole website and do
[2981.78 --> 2986.90]  that um and there were some really really good things that came from that actually some really good
[2986.90 --> 2992.82]  feedback from the team um and and he's gonna throw it to some other people as well including the labs local team
[2993.14 --> 2997.94]  and and flow plane and stuff like that just trying to sharpen it up a little bit before we send it out
[2997.94 --> 3003.14]  um and there was some really cool ideas that came from that the only one i'm gonna spit out was one of
[3003.14 --> 3008.58]  mine um which was we decided that we were going to change how you know the compare tool you press the
[3008.58 --> 3014.82]  button to add it to your cart yep we had another kind of like floating uh little module on the side that
[3014.82 --> 3020.26]  kind of did that as well but it was a little bit redundant and just a little bit odd so we were talking about
[3020.26 --> 3027.46]  removing it and um i came up with the idea of because someone else worded i think it was damned
[3027.46 --> 3034.82]  i don't remember who someone else worded it in a way that gave me this idea um oh right it was like
[3035.54 --> 3039.86]  the i think the way that it was originally described was oh we could just like put some other products
[3039.86 --> 3045.22]  there and people could choose to compare those as well and i was like okay but what if it works in a
[3045.22 --> 3052.42]  similar way to the amazon like frequently purchased with section or so we did like one they used to
[3052.42 --> 3058.58]  have people who looked at this usually ended up going with this so it'd be similar to that type of
[3058.58 --> 3063.70]  engine so now it would be like this is often compared with these things so if you're looking
[3063.70 --> 3068.42]  at a specific say graphics card it could be like well this graphics card is often compared with these
[3068.42 --> 3072.66]  so if you hear of some graphics card from your friend and you're technical enough to know about the
[3072.66 --> 3078.50]  labs website yeah but maybe you're not so into gaming performance so you're not super technical
[3078.50 --> 3082.82]  in the way of understanding gpus and their performance and all the different range of
[3082.82 --> 3087.14]  possible ones there are out there and you look up this graphics card yeah you could see oh or maybe
[3087.14 --> 3092.26]  headphones right yeah might i also suggest yeah maybe you should compare against these other ones as
[3092.26 --> 3097.46]  well because everyone else does so the labs local team doesn't have to like manually come up with these
[3097.46 --> 3103.14]  lists of suggested players it just happens fairly automatically so that's like a cool idea it'll take
[3103.14 --> 3107.54]  some time to build but absolutely super cool saying it's coming now i have no idea when we're going to
[3107.54 --> 3113.30]  work on it we have lots of lots of things to do guys there's so much potential here exactly depending on
[3113.30 --> 3121.86]  how much we can automate a lot of this capture um there is the potential but this will not happen in the
[3121.86 --> 3128.90]  short term but there's the potential that you could basically kind of preview you know whatever
[3128.90 --> 3133.54]  combination of hardware you're interested in obviously there'd be limitations right we're not
[3133.54 --> 3142.74]  going to go start throwing rtx 4090s on you know core 2 quad q6600s just for jollies so that people can
[3142.74 --> 3149.94]  play around with it we would want to focus on things that are actually realistic but um the whole idea
[3149.94 --> 3156.82]  here is to not just generate this data not just generate these captures but make it more digestible
[3156.82 --> 3162.82]  i've got people asking would this be free some level of it will be free i can't promise that
[3162.82 --> 3169.46]  everything will be free if you're sitting there laying it on my face that was about to happen
[3169.46 --> 3175.46]  eventually like if you're if you're sitting there you know um running it to the point where we're
[3175.46 --> 3179.86]  looking at it going you know you're running a small business you're in here for like two hours a day
[3180.50 --> 3185.14]  every day configuring systems for people sucking up video bandwidth at some point you might just
[3185.14 --> 3190.66]  need a pro account so i don't know i don't know where that line is going to be i don't want to do
[3190.66 --> 3196.42]  it at all i'm just being transparent because like when when linus first suggested the side-by-side viewer
[3196.42 --> 3200.74]  thing which was the first idea of integrating he was like youtube youtube right yeah yeah i was like
[3200.74 --> 3206.42]  please these are unlisted videos on youtube and he was like nope i want to do it this way and i was like
[3206.42 --> 3211.54]  okay what if we did this other option he was like nope i want to do it this way i'm like okay cool
[3212.10 --> 3218.98]  no you're not but this website doesn't have a ton of potential in its current form to make money and
[3218.98 --> 3223.54]  playing video costs a lot of money so what are we going to do bro
[3226.42 --> 3231.38]  buy screwdrivers and this was his answer and now i'm sitting here like okay i have to build this thing
[3231.38 --> 3237.86]  that's just going to saddle like a ton of cost and it's it's uh it's concerning so we're gonna have to
[3237.86 --> 3244.74]  figure out at some point how we monetize it maybe you have access to certain levels of features maybe you
[3244.74 --> 3250.66]  can watch a certain amount of comparisons a day or a week or whatever i have no idea but just leaving
[3250.66 --> 3255.94]  it fully uncorked all the time when we don't want to be super annoying or aggressive with ads are we
[3255.94 --> 3262.42]  are we gonna have any ads we don't want to say that right now i'm assuming but they're not going to be
[3262.42 --> 3266.82]  like super annoying because he's going to want to use it so they can't be super annoying we'll almost
[3266.82 --> 3274.50]  certainly um aggressively pursue affiliate revenue yeah like that is one of the ideas yeah yeah yeah
[3274.50 --> 3280.98]  like if you are if you're ultimately sitting on our site to make a purchase decision then we want
[3280.98 --> 3289.46]  a piece of that because if you think about it who did the work amazon or us if you if you buy ultimately
[3289.46 --> 3295.14]  whatever it is that you buy did the brand do the work no did the retailer do the work no what does it
[3295.14 --> 3299.86]  need to work what is it called when you're a retail employee and you you get a certain amount of money
[3299.86 --> 3304.18]  for the amount of products that commission commission yeah it's effectively commission yeah or or like a
[3304.18 --> 3310.34]  spiff or whatever you want to call it like that's that's that's something that we would absolutely
[3310.34 --> 3318.02]  pursue now what i can commit now is that that suggestion engine for example that luke is talking
[3318.02 --> 3326.74]  about will not prefer items that we get better commissions on yeah that is that is my 100 promise
[3326.74 --> 3331.62]  to you it would be purely based on in perpetuity genuinely what things people compare the thing you're
[3331.62 --> 3337.06]  looking at with because it's one of those things that makes me so angry about amazon that's why
[3337.06 --> 3344.74]  that went away that's why that makes sense and it was the only thing i used to shop it their site is
[3344.74 --> 3350.58]  utterly unnavigable now i don't know if that's a word and i don't care the point is that that was how
[3350.58 --> 3354.98]  i shopped because already their site was impossible to navigate so if i could find something that was
[3354.98 --> 3362.90]  approximately what i'm looking for then that carousel that had people who viewed this usually bought this
[3363.78 --> 3371.06]  what was how i found things like almost every time and so that's what i want to bring back i want us to
[3371.06 --> 3379.62]  be able to have you show up on some piece of pair of headphones have a little thing that pops up and says
[3379.62 --> 3388.18]  hey um couldn't help noticing you're looking at airpods max would you consider perhaps something that
[3388.18 --> 3396.74]  is not heavy and that sounds better yeah basically though so i i think that's really cool i would have
[3396.74 --> 3401.06]  never thought about that if i wasn't prompted by uh whoever on the team said i think it was dan again
[3401.06 --> 3405.70]  um and there was a lot of other actually really cool things that came out of that meeting so i'm quite
[3405.70 --> 3412.02]  excited um but yeah floatplane is going to be involved with the labs website in in some way it
[3412.02 --> 3416.58]  seems kind of inevitable now because he he just says no we're doing it every time i try to bring
[3416.58 --> 3422.50]  up alternatives here's the thing like what's the point of being vertically integrated no yeah i get
[3422.50 --> 3428.50]  it my only my only concern is cost we have media production media playback testing and we've got this
[3428.50 --> 3436.10]  site that needs what test data yeah okay media production and media playback well okay maybe i'll
[3436.10 --> 3442.34]  use some other media playback so no i'm not gonna do that no it's it's a it's a it's a great solution
[3442.34 --> 3447.22]  it's gonna end up being very good technically the only concerns that i have are on the on the business
[3447.22 --> 3451.86]  side and there were there were some ideas of like maybe the feature is entirely locked behind a flow plane
[3451.86 --> 3456.74]  subscription and we just make it so you can subscribe to flow plane uh or the line of sec tips flow plane
[3456.74 --> 3462.74]  uh through the lab's website absolutely or or whatever like almost certainly happen is a more
[3462.74 --> 3469.22]  all-you-can-eat float plane subscription that also includes some kind of perks on the lab's website i
[3469.22 --> 3476.26]  think that we're going to see some kind of rejuvenation of linus tech tips.com the forum um you know where
[3476.26 --> 3482.90]  there will be certain privileges that are granted from that float plane subscription so the more value that
[3482.90 --> 3490.18]  we can add to a float plane subscription ultimately i think the more this whole thing will make sense
[3490.18 --> 3496.42]  if we're if we're talking about theoretical features that might never exist um another idea of integrating
[3496.42 --> 3501.78]  forum stuff is there's been thoughts where the comments if we decided to do comments there are no
[3501.78 --> 3506.58]  comments right now this might never be a thing there might never be comments at all like don't don't
[3506.58 --> 3513.54]  take this too far but if we decide to do comments okay luke if we decide to do comments they could be
[3513.54 --> 3520.66]  integrated in a way where it's really just the forum and the posts on it it's just a thread forum posts
[3520.66 --> 3525.46]  it's just a thread yeah it's and it's this that is then integrated into the lab's website so it's
[3525.46 --> 3531.46]  viewable on both etc etc etc and it might just be this like mesh of websites that form into because that'll
[3531.46 --> 3538.66]  help with the forum's seo um so it'll it'll like drive up activity um it will it just add more user
[3538.66 --> 3543.38]  generated content to the forum which again is also good for seo not like the forum's ever going to make
[3543.38 --> 3553.38]  money but like but if the development we do on the forum can enhance and enrich the experience on the
[3553.38 --> 3559.86]  lab's website well then all of a sudden it has a reason for existing no for real the forum the forum
[3559.86 --> 3566.34]  exists it celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week pretty exciting i saw that someone changed the
[3566.34 --> 3572.90]  banner at the top to the og linus tech tips uh logo was that you no actually okay it was probably
[3572.90 --> 3577.94]  mortis or something yeah anyway uh so the forum celebrated its 10-year anniversary and the forum
[3577.94 --> 3585.70]  exists because of the same reason that it has always existed it exists as a desperation backup plan
[3585.70 --> 3592.66]  somewhere where our community can be that no one can ever take away from us uh and number two because
[3592.66 --> 3597.38]  i just thought it should and it's it's caught us in its net before like it is it has saved us before
[3598.02 --> 3602.74]  absolutely and when it's it's like infrastructure right when it's working just fine and you don't
[3602.74 --> 3608.98]  need it you're like oh yeah why do we have this thing why don't we keep throwing money at this when
[3608.98 --> 3616.18]  you need it suddenly and you're like when vessel goes out of business suddenly and you need somewhere
[3616.18 --> 3621.94]  to post your early access videos and some way to collect money from people to get them you're like
[3621.94 --> 3631.22]  oh yeah we've got a forum let's go yeah yeah yeah yeah anyways i don't know how the heck we got to that
[3632.02 --> 3636.42]  what topic were we on don't even worry about it is it a merch message i think so i feel like i just like
[3636.42 --> 3643.70]  like came out of a haze the point is we're really excited yeah yeah there's so many cool directions
[3643.70 --> 3649.38]  we can take it in yeah and uh we've had a good year team's really driven they're killing it we had a
[3649.38 --> 3657.94]  good year um we're hiring we're building it like let's let's go i've i've seen i've seen a ton of
[3657.94 --> 3665.46]  speculation it's really funny because we're so transparent like who who else but us would put an
[3665.46 --> 3675.06]  actual sales counter on the product page for their two biggest launches of the year we are so like
[3675.06 --> 3682.34]  painfully transparent i was i did flag that when we were making that feature but yeah i know i know um
[3682.34 --> 3688.10]  and that the amount of speculation that i see that oh linus is overextending himself on the lab
[3688.10 --> 3693.78]  i'm not going to be able to do that but i don't know what's going to do with the other people
[3693.78 --> 3698.18]  we're fine yeah i'm fine he's fine yeah everyone is fine yep
[3700.42 --> 3706.50]  we're growing oh speaking of making money and surviving sponsors also uh pay attention to the

[3933.38 --> 3933.70]  off
[3936.18 --> 3943.70]  do we have an lt store deal of the week nick is traveling um and i don't know if he has like cover
[3943.70 --> 3954.82]  so oh well we have a new shirt hey the henley shirt look at this stylish shirt uh
[3955.78 --> 3963.30]  oh okay that's cute weird picture but yes henley shirt let's go here's a bunch of people wearing it
[3963.94 --> 3970.26]  here's it being nice and soft and super nice here is um no real product information other than the
[3970.26 --> 3976.34]  materials it's made of because it everyone's traveling don't don't worry too much about that
[3976.34 --> 3980.98]  but yeah it's it's super nice hey do we have any reviews on the pajama pants yet from last week
[3981.78 --> 3988.66]  i kind of doubt it i kind of doubt it yeah people we don't send out a notification to leave a review
[3988.66 --> 3993.22]  for like a month or something like that so after we launch something there's like a month and then
[3993.22 --> 3997.94]  there's like this flood of reviews yeah i was gonna say they would need to have it and then have had it for
[3997.94 --> 4005.46]  enough time to actually formulate a good review so yeah uh speaking of the store let's talk about your
[4005.46 --> 4012.42]  junk um you're doing an underwear photo shoot yeah so we have new patterns for the underwear the only
[4012.42 --> 4016.02]  reason that i put this in the doc was because we were talking about it but then we never finished our
[4016.02 --> 4023.38]  conversation oh so uh nick gave me a three-week warning that we have new underwear patterns coming
[4023.38 --> 4033.14]  so since he told me i have done some form of workout every day nice uh my goal is to have
[4035.38 --> 4044.42]  no uh like like softening layer like i okay like i have like i have abs like you can you can see them
[4044.42 --> 4050.82]  but i want to not have i think i can tell i want to i think your abs have more bulk than they normally do
[4050.82 --> 4057.14]  so because you've always been pretty cut but i don't think i've seen that much bulk in your abs
[4057.14 --> 4065.06]  before so i make sense well that's because almost everything i do is cardio yeah normally yeah so i'm
[4065.06 --> 4073.30]  i'm doing just like some not cardio nothing nothing crazy but a little bit of anything other than cardio
[4073.30 --> 4078.42]  and also a lot of cardio so you guys have probably noticed if you're on float plane that i've been
[4078.42 --> 4086.18]  streaming beat saber more lately ain't an accident um gotcha trying to trying to trying to get rid of
[4086.18 --> 4093.94]  trying to get rid of some of that so yep yep now i know you've been working out a lot lately yeah i i've
[4093.94 --> 4101.30]  been working out um okay so i said six days a week because i didn't fully explain it uh so i do something
[4101.30 --> 4109.54]  that contributes to physical health seven days a week i work out six days a week okay on tuesdays i do
[4110.10 --> 4117.30]  uh rotating cold and heat exposure for an hour and 15 you're gonna have to explain what rotating
[4117.30 --> 4125.14]  cold and heat exposure so i so you like light a fire and then you just so i don't have the fridge over
[4125.14 --> 4129.46]  here and a fireplace here yeah that'd actually be really interesting i don't think that would work
[4129.46 --> 4136.02]  very well but um i i do an ice bath for five minutes oh what ice bath and then i drip dry for
[4136.02 --> 4144.18]  a minute and a half and then i do uh i don't have a sauna so a simulated sauna for 20 minutes okay and
[4144.18 --> 4151.30]  then ice bath for five drip dry one and a half sauna for 20. i basically do that rotation of three things
[4151.30 --> 4156.98]  three times that sounds awful it is i won't do it yeah that's fine i don't care how badly i need it i
[4156.98 --> 4163.22]  will not do that and then every other day of the week i do some form of workout so um today is sprints
[4163.94 --> 4171.70]  okay you know what i will do and i'm not sure that you would let me just say this do you know what an
[4171.70 --> 4177.78]  epilator is is that the stairmaster machine nope that's an elliptical okay no okay
[4177.78 --> 4186.58]  it's no no no no i'll explain it it's okay there there's there's stuff that i'm working on that is
[4186.58 --> 4197.38]  more than just the physique because i not a huge body hair fan okay let me put it this way the line between
[4197.38 --> 4206.18]  feminine um like uh beauty products and actual torture devices
[4207.38 --> 4215.38]  is truly a thin one indeed some of them are terrifying yeah oh yeah an epilator is a hair removal tool
[4215.38 --> 4224.34]  that's like an auto plucker so it's kind of like a motorized razor oh but it has a spinning thing that
[4224.34 --> 4230.82]  has these wires that narrow so that when the hair gets caught in the wire it rips it out so it
[4230.82 --> 4236.34]  literally just rips all your hair it literally just rips out your hair as you run it across your body
[4237.14 --> 4246.90]  i would deeply prefer to do hot and cold exposure that sounds atrociously horrible um wow um
[4246.90 --> 4254.02]  wow it's really painful yeah as you as you might as you might expect you've already done this i yeah
[4254.02 --> 4258.42]  well i've tried it because i'm just like what is what is the best way what is the best way to do this
[4258.42 --> 4263.78]  so is your plan to do this just before the photo shoot is your plan to like keep this up so i will
[4263.78 --> 4272.26]  say this once you've once you've kind of gotten everything once it's way easier okay it is it's like so
[4272.26 --> 4278.74]  many things in life it's a hundred times easier to keep up than it is to catch up wow um
[4280.58 --> 4289.38]  yeah wow it's it's very it's very painful um that's rough oh what like um not to be way too specific
[4289.38 --> 4296.10]  yeah where do you do this is this just like a chest like a uh torso like chest like like around the tummy
[4296.10 --> 4304.18]  yeah yeah my like my hair in my like tummy zone is coming in i thought for a long my dad has like
[4304.18 --> 4309.14]  i used to joke and i'd like slap my dad in the chest just be like killed all the forest animals because
[4312.58 --> 4318.74]  because he had like all this hair he's very hairy uh and even in my like late 20s i was like
[4319.30 --> 4325.38]  not gonna be me must have got the genes from the other side of the family whatever and now my tummy i
[4325.86 --> 4331.86]  never really pay attention and i brushed it the other day and i was like yeah so when i met so long
[4331.86 --> 4339.14]  when i met yvonne it was like oh a little treasure trail yeah and now it's like thick above the belly
[4339.14 --> 4344.82]  treasure forest yeah and it's like there with lynx adventure yeah and master sword and as soon as
[4344.82 --> 4352.66]  as soon as there's no clear bear patch between the chest and the tummy and the legs yeah it's like
[4352.66 --> 4353.54]  bit of a different look
[4357.62 --> 4365.54]  yeah yeah i'm very jealous of both of you you're gel oh yeah well no he's a hairy dude oh my god
[4366.10 --> 4373.62]  oh yeah yeah okay yeah and okay okay so people are bringing up laser uh i can afford laser not gonna
[4373.62 --> 4381.46]  not gonna hide that um finding a place that'll do laser on men not easy really yeah i mean okay
[4381.46 --> 4388.10]  especially if it's like in an intimate area but the vast majority i don't want to do that that'd be
[4388.10 --> 4393.14]  horrible well anyway the point is that finding places that will even do any kind of like laser
[4393.14 --> 4399.22]  hair removal treatment on men is not that easy is there a reason they just don't want to weird well like
[4399.22 --> 4405.62]  like because i don't know men are gross i guess i guess yeah for real i don't know uh is there is
[4405.62 --> 4409.06]  there any downsides of laser hair removal does it like mess with your sweat glands or anything like
[4409.06 --> 4413.14]  that no no okay the downside is the cost and you have to go back a lot of times and it hurts
[4413.94 --> 4418.58]  like any hair i mean any hair removal hurts so people have been saying nair that's like that's
[4418.58 --> 4425.22]  the it like dissolves the hair that also wow that creeps me out yeah honestly i'd rather the pain
[4425.22 --> 4429.46]  than put a chemical that dissolves hair all over my body like if if we were talking like
[4429.46 --> 4434.90]  your skin's an organ my dudes yeah if we were talking like oh i wanna it absorbs stuff i i i
[4434.90 --> 4440.42]  wanna like uh oh man what would i even okay if we were talking like oh my stupid watch strap is
[4440.42 --> 4444.42]  always catching in my hair and i'm just gonna do like a little patch around my wrist or something
[4444.42 --> 4449.86]  like that yeah i'd probably yeah i'd yeah i'd probably throw some air on there run the run the
[4449.86 --> 4454.66]  epilator in a circle around your yeah i think i would not do that yeah i think i would not do that um
[4455.54 --> 4460.90]  but if it's if it's like a significant chunk of your body i think i'd i think i'd rather
[4462.34 --> 4468.10]  do it the natural way people are talking in float plane chat they're like lasers almost always done
[4468.10 --> 4473.86]  on women um so it's viewed as like a safe space or something like i don't know wouldn't it be a
[4473.86 --> 4479.22]  private room like what does that even mean they want to avoid harassment towards the staff i mean yeah
[4479.78 --> 4484.82]  i don't know sure i guess i don't know i just know that i called a couple places and they were just
[4484.82 --> 4489.38]  nodded they were like i'm sorry i can tell by your voice we will not be working on you i'm like okay
[4489.38 --> 4495.38]  really yeah yeah they were just like nope that doesn't seem fair well what if you just have a deep
[4495.38 --> 4503.14]  voice i mean they clarified obviously but i'm i'm i got you i got you i got you i got you basically
[4503.14 --> 4510.26]  they were immediately not interested in talking to me yeah um rough i might have somebody to recommend
[4510.26 --> 4515.30]  oh geek power says gay guys definitely get laser removal done i'd imagine there'd be a number of
[4515.30 --> 4520.26]  places in big city like vancouver yeah i was probably just like calling the wrong places like if you go
[4520.26 --> 4525.46]  if you go somewhere that like specializes in you know that community or whatever else then i'm sure
[4526.10 --> 4533.78]  worked on guys before yeah that makes sense yeah yeah anyway the point is is that even legal
[4533.78 --> 4542.74]  epilating hurts yeah i imagine yeah yeah i i hate yeah i hate i've always disliked pulling hairs i don't
[4542.74 --> 4547.70]  know it just sucks i don't know and it's very like localized and really sharp like it feels like a needle
[4547.70 --> 4553.70]  like i feel like when you get i don't know why different forms of pain despite even potentially
[4553.70 --> 4559.38]  being more like in quotes painful or easier to deal with yeah like this is the same guy that was it last
[4559.38 --> 4563.54]  week or the week before you were talking about oh no it was the worst videos video where you were
[4563.54 --> 4568.02]  talking about like getting someone to tackle you as hard as they could like that's actually whatever
[4568.02 --> 4574.26]  not a huge deal but like if i pluck one of like a pluck a mono i would literally rather that you tackled me
[4574.26 --> 4580.42]  yeah i get it yeah i get it it's just for some reason maybe it's totally mental but it's just
[4580.42 --> 4585.62]  easier to deal with yep i don't know what it is or why or whatever but it's just always been that way
[4586.34 --> 4593.22]  yeah well the heck this is the second time this show how did we get here i don't know where did we
[4593.22 --> 4598.58]  get here from oh right the modeling session okay that makes sense yeah so i'm gonna be ready this time
[4598.58 --> 4603.06]  i'm gonna be ready nice yeah are you are you trying to do anything because so i know you're
[4603.06 --> 4607.70]  trying to get more definition in the ab area a little more definition are you trying to do more
[4609.38 --> 4614.74]  you mentioned something about your chest i have no pecs i am three weeks is not a long time are you
[4614.74 --> 4619.94]  one week in so you have two weeks left yeah that's one of the reasons why at the roast me making flat
[4619.94 --> 4625.22]  chested jokes that my wife was like probably not that okay you know i'm flatter than her
[4625.22 --> 4632.98]  uh anyway the sorry what um like so are you not going to try to work on those areas beat saber
[4632.98 --> 4636.90]  actually helps a lot with that that makes sense yeah um there's a lot of it's not more shoulders
[4636.90 --> 4641.94]  it's not it doesn't help the way that like doing weights would it doesn't help bulk up but it helps
[4641.94 --> 4647.46]  define it a bit more well this would help with pecs if you like did these right yeah i expected you
[4647.46 --> 4651.62]  most people would go with the the bench but i don't know i don't know anything i you know i don't
[4651.62 --> 4659.06]  know how a weight room works i haven't i barely do i haven't oh shut up compared to me it's so stop
[4659.06 --> 4665.70]  it's so no stop now it's so deep stop and that community is so critical it's crazy luke let me
[4665.70 --> 4671.62]  put it this good reason in a lot of cases let me put it this way i haven't set foot in a weight room
[4671.62 --> 4682.02]  since grade 10. not even set foot and in grade 10 i our school gave you options when you were doing
[4682.02 --> 4691.30]  the weight unit in pe you could do that or a sport i did one day and i switched over to the sport
[4691.30 --> 4702.10]  i have literally not even sat on a weight machine of any sort in over 20 years this is the first time
[4702.10 --> 4707.70]  so you and i have talked about this a bunch yeah one of my biggest problems for the last
[4707.70 --> 4715.78]  long time has been that i keep trying to work out and for certain reasons uh that i don't necessarily
[4715.78 --> 4721.54]  want to go way into but i end up injuring myself like every time every time it's like it's hard
[4721.54 --> 4727.30]  to watch honestly as yeah like i know i'm sure it is and it's hard for me too like it's just it sucks
[4727.30 --> 4732.26]  so i get excited i get motivated and then i push too far i push too hard and i injure myself and
[4732.26 --> 4737.30]  there's reasons why that happens and i don't want to go into it but it happens and then i get really
[4737.30 --> 4744.98]  discouraged and i get really uh like self-loathing and unhappy and lethargic and then i i i lose it
[4744.98 --> 4749.62]  because like oh i'll injure one specified area it's almost always one of the three things it's
[4749.62 --> 4753.78]  my lower back it's my right knee it's my right shoulder yeah like it's it's always one of those
[4753.78 --> 4757.94]  things because those are pre-existing injuries from when i was growing up and i'll i'll trigger
[4757.94 --> 4763.46]  one of them and even though i could work like if it's my knee okay sure you can do everything upper
[4763.46 --> 4768.74]  body who cares right but i'm just super discouraged because leg day is actually my favorite day i'm one of
[4768.74 --> 4773.54]  those weird people i love doing leg day so when leg day gets taken out of the rotation i'm like oh well
[4774.10 --> 4777.62]  it's hard to get motivated if it's my shoulder if it's my lower back i'm just kind of screwed but
[4777.62 --> 4781.14]  if it's my shoulder it's like okay well i could keep doing leg day but then i'm like okay
[4782.10 --> 4787.46]  but the upper body stuff is the stuff you actually get like credit for yeah so then now i'm just like
[4787.46 --> 4793.30]  well that sucks and it just i just get really demotivated so my my biggest goal this time by a huge
[4793.30 --> 4798.50]  amount uh form is everything i usually don't get injured because of form problems i don't want to get
[4798.50 --> 4805.06]  into it it's a way longer conversation it is but uh the the big goal this time is don't get injured
[4805.06 --> 4811.06]  yeah so i'm doing everything really high five yeah yeah i'm doing everything really really
[4811.06 --> 4817.46]  scientifically okay i have notebooks yeah i track everything well i know you have that trainer
[4818.10 --> 4822.34]  not right now oh i'm going to be going back to him okay cool um because he was fantastic
[4822.90 --> 4827.22]  there's no nothing against him right now my schedule is just too weird i was i was doing
[4827.22 --> 4831.94]  stuff previously i got sick for three weeks there i have wisdom teeth coming out soon there's just
[4831.94 --> 4835.62]  stuff all over the place once my schedule gets a little bit more do steroids no oh my god
[4835.62 --> 4846.34]  oh my god what no um trust me my penis is small enough our balls rather yeah i mean both are true
[4846.34 --> 4852.82]  i was gonna say is it i thought it was just but i thought it just reduced ball anyways no i mean both
[4852.82 --> 4864.50]  of the things i thought are true oh my god okay um so yeah i've been i've been uh very very very focused on
[4864.50 --> 4869.54]  being being as like scientific and documented and measured about everything as i possibly can
[4869.54 --> 4877.62]  so i'm like taking really extensive notes i even track like um how grip feels right so like in in one
[4877.62 --> 4884.10]  of my uh sets i end up doing a lot of things that require grip so i'll like note how my grip feels
[4884.10 --> 4888.26]  throughout the entire thing to like make sure there's no possibility of over training all this type of
[4888.26 --> 4892.74]  stuff blah blah blah and it's been really it's been an interesting rabbit hole to dive down
[4892.74 --> 4898.34]  um because traditionally i don't i don't know a lot about this and i wouldn't say that i do now
[4898.34 --> 4904.18]  um but i know a lot more than i did like three months ago because i've been doing a ton of research
[4904.18 --> 4910.10]  and trying to make sure that i don't uh this is hilarious this is probably the least tech when show
[4910.10 --> 4919.46]  in a very long time and people are loving it so dumb what even is this show i have no idea anymore
[4919.46 --> 4926.90]  i can i can uh if you want to target other areas and there's way better people to talk to about this
[4926.90 --> 4932.50]  than me but i can send you like a a thing like a like a workout thing yeah uh i'm not gonna do it
[4932.50 --> 4937.94]  okay i'll tell you right now i'm just not gonna do it if i was there no okay no i just wouldn't invite
[4937.94 --> 4942.82]  you over i feel like that sounds like a lot of we have to go somewhere else anyways oh yeah don't have
[4942.82 --> 4948.02]  oh like at a gym yeah i'll do it once okay yeah yeah no i'll do it once i'll do it once i'll i'll
[4948.02 --> 4954.74]  try it and i will be open-minded but i'm not gonna like it yeah i i always hated it and i i've talked
[4954.74 --> 4959.94]  to linus with this i i've only ever liked doing things that were really sports specific it's like
[4959.94 --> 4964.34]  something that i really used to enjoy was was pushing weighted sleds sure because to me it's like
[4964.34 --> 4969.70]  okay this is similar to rugby or football which i'm gonna have to do this yeah so i might as well be
[4969.70 --> 4974.34]  good at this is really specific i like this i never really liked just like lifting weights
[4974.34 --> 4981.62]  um because i always wanted to train the sport instead of train strength um but recently there's
[4981.62 --> 4988.74]  like health reasons why i'm doing this um and that is motivating yeah so i'm doing it for that and
[4988.74 --> 4992.18]  that's why i was saying like i'm focusing really on on injury prevention and stuff like that because
[4992.18 --> 4998.42]  i'm like the goal is health reasons so i don't want to if i hurt myself that's a big negative for
[4998.42 --> 5005.06]  health reasons yeah so like i yeah it's that i have found that to be motivating for getting into
[5005.06 --> 5009.94]  the gym because i have started to feel significantly better like losing the weight when i was just
[5009.94 --> 5016.42]  focused on that was good mentally and physically like i felt i felt a lot better i could tell you
[5016.42 --> 5022.82]  i could tell you felt different yeah yeah and now i have not lost i was losing weight fairly rapidly i think
[5022.82 --> 5029.70]  and then in the in the course of the last month i have actually not lost any weight at all my waist
[5029.70 --> 5035.70]  size has gone down but i have not lost weight because i've been converting right yeah i've been
[5035.70 --> 5040.50]  working on composition so i'm more focused on reducing fat amounts and stuff like that i don't
[5040.50 --> 5045.22]  really care about weight anymore for you to get me dragged out to the gym the best way to do it would
[5045.22 --> 5052.26]  be to make it work so why don't we do a float plane exclusive linus's first gym session in 20 plus years
[5052.82 --> 5056.42]  and we'll just we'll drag a shooter out with us we'll take someone from the social team or something
[5056.42 --> 5063.06]  like that and we'll do it okay we could use like my terrible apartment gym or something sure or whatever
[5063.06 --> 5067.38]  because i don't know about filming like doing professional filming in gyms well it won't be
[5067.38 --> 5070.98]  professional filming it'll just be a full plane exclusive so it'll shot one like an iphone or whatever
[5070.98 --> 5074.74]  yeah yeah it should be fine yeah sure i mean people have got to be like filming themselves in the gym
[5074.74 --> 5080.66]  all the time yeah yeah there's no way yeah yeah yeah um instead like if we showed up with someone with
[5080.66 --> 5090.26]  like a like no no no no no stuff yeah all right let's talk about some tech amd announced their ryzen 7000
[5090.26 --> 5097.94]  non-x and ryzen 7000 x 3d chips at ces they made a lot of noise about these uh and they're pretty exciting
[5097.94 --> 5109.30]  okay so last gen the 5800 x 3d was kind of worse than the regular 5800x overclocking was locked
[5110.10 --> 5116.02]  it was clear that amd had some some some challenges they had to get the voltages dialed in perfectly for
[5116.02 --> 5122.90]  this thing um if i recall correctly the clock speeds weren't even quite as high as the regular 5800x don't
[5122.90 --> 5129.54]  quote me on that one uh the point is this time around the x3ds are pretty darn aggressive base
[5129.54 --> 5137.14]  frequencies are lower but turbo frequencies look like they are pretty equivalent to their non-x3d
[5137.14 --> 5143.46]  counterparts that's exciting because they have double the level 3 cache so we should see that same kind
[5143.46 --> 5151.22]  of gaming uplift we hope but they not only um are going to have the extra cache but they're actually
[5151.22 --> 5158.74]  coming in at lower tdps 120 watts versus 170 watts i'm pretty excited about these but i'm also really
[5158.74 --> 5166.26]  liking the look of the regular non-x 7000 series chips and here it's less about the specs and more
[5166.26 --> 5174.58]  about the difference in price the 7900 is over a hundred dollars less than the x it is theoretically
[5174.58 --> 5183.14]  anyway closer to a third of the power consumption than to half of it same cache nearly the same turbo
[5183.14 --> 5192.26]  frequency and much lower base frequencies we see that on the 77 and the 7600s as well but man these
[5192.26 --> 5197.70]  things could be gaming monsters for a much lower price and much lower power consumption which is a big
[5197.70 --> 5206.50]  deal these days meanwhile intel launched t-series and regular non-k series chips that um completely
[5206.50 --> 5211.94]  slipped under our radar they're supposedly launched i can't see anywhere you can buy them and i didn't
[5211.94 --> 5217.14]  see a single review we didn't even get so much as a heads up that these things were coming let alone
[5217.14 --> 5227.06]  review samples which leads me to believe that um this could be bad uh here's the info on these
[5228.18 --> 5235.54]  they are mistakenly labeled as unlocked apparently they are in fact not unlocked uh where is that i
[5235.54 --> 5241.22]  don't i don't actually see that here but it's in my oh yeah there it is oh it's up at the top sorry
[5241.22 --> 5248.26]  it's right here at the top core unlocked desktop processors nope they are apparently not unlocked um
[5248.98 --> 5254.58]  and so not only are they not unlocked for overclocking but they also have more limited performance
[5254.58 --> 5262.90]  performance their tdps are 65 or 35 watts but turbo power can go as high as 219 watts on a core i9 13 900
[5263.54 --> 5268.98]  and but it won't do that forever k series chips will boost forever as of 12th gen but non-k chips have
[5268.98 --> 5275.22]  power limits and will down clock to base clock after boosting for long enough the core i5-13600 and below
[5275.22 --> 5281.06]  also have some interesting characteristics level 2 cache drops to 11.5 versus 20 megabytes for the k
[5281.06 --> 5286.82]  k variant remember i was just talking about amd's x3d chips and how adding more cash can be really great
[5286.82 --> 5293.70]  for gaming well you can probably extrapolate what taking cash away is likely to do um leaked slides
[5294.50 --> 5300.74]  showing this led to speculation that these chips are actually derived from alder lake oh instead of
[5300.74 --> 5309.14]  raptor lake interesting i i i doubt that i doubt that there are some improvements over 12th gen so the i5s have
[5309.14 --> 5318.82]  um more e cores apparently okay so that's cool um yeah no okay anthony wrote in here that they did not
[5318.82 --> 5326.50]  seed review samples at all so okay but at least hey you get oh new egg has them now let's see are they
[5326.50 --> 5331.78]  actually in stock can i buy one yes i can and you get a free intel screwdriver with purchase what intel's
[5331.78 --> 5336.26]  competing with me now i was just gonna say what's going on here intel where's the screwdriver what's it
[5336.26 --> 5342.10]  look like is it ratcheting okay well there they are so we're gonna have to get on this and either
[5342.10 --> 5345.86]  intel's gonna have to send us some samples or we're just gonna have to buy them because
[5345.86 --> 5352.98]  i want to know what the crap is going on oh yeah here's something you won't find that intel also
[5352.98 --> 5361.06]  quietly did on any promotional slides but they quietly increased the price of most 12th gen chips by 10
[5361.06 --> 5370.26]  percent so this actually makes 12th gen more expensive than 13th gen um okay our discussion
[5370.26 --> 5375.22]  question is what is intel trying to hide with these quiet launches and price adjustments maybe that
[5375.22 --> 5383.30]  its name competes with one of the biggest media companies in the world t-series thanks thanks for
[5383.30 --> 5389.22]  that and how is intel expecting these to keep up with amd's also just announced ryzen 7000 non-x
[5389.22 --> 5393.94]  processors maybe they're not which is why they shadow launched it yeah i guess so it's a little
[5393.94 --> 5402.10]  weird i yeah i good luck intel yeah speaking of good luck dell apparently wants to phase out chips made
[5402.10 --> 5410.10]  in china by 2024 yeah dell plans to stop using chinese-made semiconductors in all its products
[5411.06 --> 5417.30]  including chips produced by foreign suppliers inside china they're also telling suppliers to reduce the
[5417.30 --> 5423.14]  amount of other made in china components in products dell is reportedly concerned about us china tensions
[5423.14 --> 5431.94]  after the u.s added chinese memory chip maker ytmc and 21 other major companies in china uh in china's ai
[5431.94 --> 5439.70]  sector to a trade blacklist in december uh block list in december dell also expects to move 50 of
[5439.70 --> 5446.02]  production and assembly capacity outside of china by 2025. most major brands are now sourcing most components
[5446.02 --> 5452.74]  from taiwan and south korea apple has moved its a tiny fraction of their production to vietnam
[5452.74 --> 5459.62]  uh but the vietnamese labor force is less than seven percent the size of china's with only 12 of
[5459.62 --> 5468.74]  those being classed as highly skilled interesting moves this might china's creating a lot of their own
[5468.74 --> 5484.34]  problems right now but they're also i also kind of feel for the companies there um a lot of this has nothing to do with them like this is a tough situation all around speaking of china by the way i did get some details wrong on the situation with the michaels
[5484.34 --> 5499.78]  um the whole thing where they uh where they arrested the huawei cfo um i'm not gonna say she did nothing wrong because huawei is a shady shady company um but that particular thing
[5500.34 --> 5506.66]  was a little more complicated than just she did something illegal and it was bad and should have been arrested so
[5506.66 --> 5516.34]  there was a lot of political uh political 4d chess going on is all i'll really say about it at this point
[5516.34 --> 5522.42]  the main takeaway from last week though was not the details the point was i'm not traveling somewhere that
[5522.42 --> 5533.06]  arbitrarily detains canadians that's it yeah uh it's it's interesting though because if okay sorry
[5533.06 --> 5540.18]  well no i'm gonna jump in with this sue for aws in float plane chat why feel sorry for chinese companies
[5540.18 --> 5545.46]  they're owned and controlled by the chinese communist party at the end of the day not all of them that's why
[5545.46 --> 5557.86]  well and that that that's my whole point they did you answered your own question okay yeah uh what i'm
[5557.86 --> 5563.14]  saying is this might be an interesting like business move for dell uh i mean they they sort of directly
[5563.14 --> 5567.46]  called it out but if one of the companies that they work with gets put on a block list
[5569.30 --> 5573.94]  that could be extremely disruptive if it happens suddenly but if they try to get ahead of the curve
[5573.94 --> 5579.30]  on this and work with companies that aren't going to be put on a block list because those companies are
[5579.30 --> 5584.82]  are outside of there say in in taiwan or elsewhere or vietnam or whatever um
[5584.82 --> 5591.14]  um yeah less disruption in the supply chain is good when you have a supply chain it's going to be
[5591.14 --> 5594.74]  hard to have less disruption in the supply chain i forget what the numbers are but it's like a
[5594.74 --> 5603.22]  like a an incredible percentage of earth's rare earth metals are mined in china like there is no
[5603.22 --> 5608.34]  semiconductor industry as we know it in places where china runs the mining yeah that's a whole other thing
[5608.34 --> 5619.22]  yeah yeah yeah yeah okay moving on i feel like we should do more merch messages but there's probably
[5619.22 --> 5623.94]  other topics in here that we yeah i think there's a couple others that we i wanted to talk about ea not
[5623.94 --> 5629.86]  being able to recover 60 of players corrupted madden save files now obvious i don't play madden um so i
[5629.86 --> 5635.06]  don't really have any skin in this particular game but here's what went down madden nfl 23 has had
[5635.06 --> 5639.54]  server-side issues for months with the latest being a temporary data storage issue that led to the
[5639.54 --> 5645.38]  corruption of many players connected franchise mode save games being lost um there's the corruption of
[5645.38 --> 5650.82]  many uh last week anyway for about 14 hours between december 28th and 29th players trying to access the
[5650.82 --> 5655.46]  cfm server got an error message saying leagues were unavailable if you tried to log in during this time
[5655.46 --> 5661.70]  your save data was corrupted unfortunately this period came just hours after a twitter post letting players
[5661.70 --> 5668.66]  know that they could now play cfm without issue this was after developers fixed a previous problem
[5668.66 --> 5673.46]  in the game meaning that more players than normal may have tried to log in during this period you want
[5673.46 --> 5678.26]  to know what a depressing piece of information sure i have not fully validated this i just heard this from
[5678.26 --> 5687.14]  someone i don't remember who sorry whoever it was um fifa ultimate team the like not completely but
[5687.14 --> 5693.30]  people are going to get mad at me if i say it because there's money printing machine yeah pay to win
[5694.26 --> 5700.58]  soccer basically um football but yes it's not because you can still be better than the other players shut up
[5700.58 --> 5707.70]  um pay to win fifa soccer just brought in by itself just fifa ultimate team
[5709.06 --> 5715.78]  more than elden ring made this year elden ring was game of the year wow and was like
[5716.58 --> 5720.82]  mass sometimes game of the year wins they're not necessarily like the most popular thing but
[5720.82 --> 5726.82]  elden ring was extremely popular oh yeah it was a it was a cultural moment absolutely yeah fifa
[5726.82 --> 5732.18]  ultimate team still made more money annihilated it destroyed so you want you wonder why the games
[5732.18 --> 5736.82]  industry is going the way that it is yeah so the reason that i wanted to talk about this save game
[5736.82 --> 5746.02]  thing is that i i i have as someone who has lost save files and then ultimately just never gone back
[5746.02 --> 5752.34]  and finished the game because of how disheartening that was i feel for these guys this sucks and this
[5752.34 --> 5759.86]  is a huge part of why i get so angry at nintendo for locking cloud saves on a portable device to people who
[5759.86 --> 5767.54]  pay a subscription that should be illegal um this is why i get this is why this is why i didn't play
[5767.54 --> 5775.38]  fantasia for so long that rpg yeah um from hirinobu sakaguchi i think is his name but basically uh one
[5775.38 --> 5781.06]  of one of the guys that worked on final fantasy 6 like my all-time mostly favorite game i would
[5781.06 --> 5785.06]  have said all time through through nostalgia glasses it's my favorite game but there's probably games i've
[5785.06 --> 5790.34]  played since then that i think objectively are better but one of my all-time favorite games and
[5790.34 --> 5796.66]  the reason that i didn't play it was because it was exclusive to apple arcade and i just i had no way
[5796.66 --> 5801.54]  of knowing i had no way of controlling that save file any save file that isn't on a server that i
[5801.54 --> 5810.82]  control doesn't exist as far as i'm concerned um and i just this is why this is my problem because if i
[5810.82 --> 5817.78]  lose it all right i lost it that sucks but that's on me that's on me yeah if somebody else loses it
[5817.78 --> 5826.18]  that is crap that's garbage that's garbage and i hate it but i caved i was at costco right before
[5826.18 --> 5835.94]  christmas picked up an apple tv i've been playing fantasia it's great i love it uh and the reason is that
[5835.94 --> 5840.42]  i always just assumed it would get ported to something else at some point and so i just like
[5840.42 --> 5844.74]  waited passively just waited and waited and waited it's been a long time okay part two's out okay i'm
[5844.74 --> 5854.26]  gonna keep waiting apple funded the whole damn thing it's never going anywhere else yeah yeah yeah
[5854.26 --> 5862.50]  yeah yikes did we do the ltx update i'm gonna try and play it before i have to actually pay for arcade
[5862.50 --> 5868.26]  though but i did buy an apple tv you return it part of the re no part of the reason i bought the apple tv
[5868.26 --> 5872.90]  no that's not why i bought it at costco uh part of the reason i bought the apple tv is because i've
[5872.90 --> 5880.58]  been so um bullish on the shield for so long but i realized like you know whether it's our whether it's
[5880.58 --> 5886.98]  our admittedly ignorant conversation about roku or whether it's apple tv i actually haven't tried a lot
[5886.98 --> 5892.98]  of other platforms so i also want to just try it i've never tried an apple tv and we're on like the
[5892.98 --> 5900.82]  eighth generation of this apparently popular device at this point so i was like okay it cost me 119
[5901.38 --> 5907.22]  or whatever and i can i can try this i can try this thing i've never tried before and i can also play
[5907.22 --> 5915.54]  this game i really want to play so yeah makes sense uh did we do the weekly update for ltx no
[5915.54 --> 5926.18]  oh sarah made some wallpapers for ltx 2023 and they look amazing exciting is that the is that it no
[5926.18 --> 5931.86]  there we go hey that is actually that's cute uh these are for the different the different levels of
[5931.86 --> 5934.74]  of whale land hey the dolphin the orca
[5938.18 --> 5944.34]  whale hell yeah that's the winner then there's night mode night mode whale oh that's so sick
[5944.34 --> 5951.30]  yeah we've got some really cool desk pad designs coming i i signed off on one recently that i
[5951.30 --> 5958.10]  absolutely love actually done by maria whale land i guess technically yeah her job is like graphic
[5958.10 --> 5963.70]  designer but what she mostly does is thumbnails so i never really thought of her as graphic designer i
[5963.70 --> 5968.90]  thought of her as thumbnail specialist so when i was like oh yeah who did this one it's like maria i was
[5968.90 --> 5976.26]  like oh what oh okay yeah right right that makes sense yeah yeah uh we're getting ready for sales
[5976.26 --> 5984.10]  this month likely during wan oh wan show on the 27th we're being that clear okay okay for that weekend
[5984.98 --> 5988.42]  want to pick a time that works for as many people as possible but we know that someone will always
[5988.42 --> 5993.62]  be inconvenienced it's literally there's last ltx people came from all over the world there are
[5993.62 --> 5998.58]  literally more than 24 time zones yeah there's only so much we can do to make sure that everyone
[5998.58 --> 6005.22]  gets a fair crack at it yeah um we can also probably do a preview of the ticket store slash page
[6005.22 --> 6013.62]  once things are further along okay cool cool tesla finally announces why is this in here do we care
[6013.62 --> 6018.26]  around steering wheel picture this i picked this whole thing why would you pick this because i think it's
[6018.26 --> 6025.22]  really funny oh because they gave up because the yoke because their stock is like because the yoke made me
[6025.22 --> 6035.62]  so irrationally angry i do not like being told a race car i do not like being told how i am allowed to
[6035.62 --> 6044.98]  use my okay i don't like it and i think that while it might make sense in a in a track car
[6044.98 --> 6051.38]  i think that's cool if you only turn them 90 degrees yes or like a little bit more it it just
[6052.66 --> 6059.30]  i i considered a tesla at some point because you know i bought a new car yeah the yoke was better
[6059.30 --> 6068.98]  choice by the way absolute absolute deal breaker deal breaker there was no way that i was going to buy
[6068.98 --> 6076.82]  a vehicle that had a silly yoke for its steering wheel um and to the point where i actually looked
[6076.82 --> 6084.90]  up like third-party replacements and oh man it is sad how desperate people got to get rid of the yoke
[6085.54 --> 6091.62]  i couldn't find anywhere that actually had like a nicely molded and wrapped like real replacement steering
[6091.62 --> 6100.34]  wheel but what you can buy is like an awful clip-on stupid cringe like steering wheel completer for the
[6100.34 --> 6112.82]  yoke and i so when i saw this i kind of went i just really like it when super arrogant companies that have
[6112.82 --> 6120.74]  the balls to dictate to the user the better way that you didn't want and you're telling me you don't like
[6120.74 --> 6126.66]  but it's better i love it when they backtrack it was funny when i love it blizzard did that in a
[6126.66 --> 6132.66]  pretty legendary way when they were like they were talking about wild classic and the the guy was
[6132.66 --> 6138.98]  asking for it and the person on stage was like he said you think you do but you don't and he was
[6138.98 --> 6142.90]  talking about like people wanting wild classic and then they released it and they're like no one's
[6142.90 --> 6147.38]  really gonna play it and stuff and then everyone played it until they ruined it again yeah basically
[6147.38 --> 6150.74]  yeah pretty epic classic no that's blizzard
[6155.30 --> 6161.06]  speaking of other major companies microsoft asks chat gpt oh hold on hold on there was one small
[6161.06 --> 6167.78]  detail okay um you can actually retrofit it now tesla will retrofit your yoke garbage with
[6167.78 --> 6170.98]  a steering wheel it'll cost you seven hundred dollars i wonder how many people are going to do that
[6170.98 --> 6181.94]  frankly i would pay it a hundred percent um okay yeah microsoft chat gpt oh wow panos penne hopefully
[6181.94 --> 6186.82]  i said that correct i am very sorry the man in charge of windows told an audience at ces that the
[6186.82 --> 6193.86]  ai engine in amd's new 7000 series chips is going to in quotes reinvent how you do everything in windows
[6193.86 --> 6199.86]  search that's a big statement he did not elaborate on how but some journalists have been speculating
[6199.86 --> 6205.78]  that one improvement is going to be windows search i doubt it windows search has to be bad on purpose
[6205.78 --> 6210.98]  at this point yeah that's actually i feel that way as well it's atrociously bad and it's been
[6210.98 --> 6218.50]  atrociously bad for a really long time yeah search genuinely on like windows 7 is far better search on
[6218.50 --> 6226.90]  windows 98 se is better yeah than the current search honestly wild genuinely wild um in 2019
[6226.90 --> 6233.78]  openai entered an exclusive computing deal with microsoft all their offerings since then from dali
[6233.78 --> 6241.38]  to chat gpt have run on azure servers this one billion dollar exclusivity deal is expected to extend
[6241.38 --> 6247.94]  to the desktop and perhaps also other parts of microsoft's business he called this i called this hard
[6247.94 --> 6252.58]  called this so hard i don't remember whether it was on wan show or not i think it was private i will
[6252.58 --> 6258.42]  vouch for you i appreciate it he called this super hard like immediately after we talked about chat gpt
[6258.42 --> 6263.94]  okay go ahead yeah microsoft is apparently in talks with openai about implementing chat gpt into bing which
[6263.94 --> 6270.26]  is specifically what i called out yeah to improve search results and overall user experience i mean people
[6270.26 --> 6277.70]  even without active access to the internet people just stopped googling things and started typing
[6277.70 --> 6287.86]  questions into chat gpt with an active connection yeah literally like right when chappy chat gpt launched
[6287.86 --> 6292.10]  i started looking to open ai a little bit more saw that microsoft had this billion dollar investment
[6292.10 --> 6296.26]  with technical exclusivity and all this type of stuff and i was like i see exactly where this is
[6296.26 --> 6305.70]  going because for whatever reason the thing that they won't drop is bing they've wanted bing to work for
[6305.70 --> 6311.94]  so long so bad just doesn't push it so hard and it sucks so much binged thing is the word google
[6312.58 --> 6318.58]  um which has got to be so brutal yikes and now they have chat gpt and one of the main things that
[6318.58 --> 6323.78]  was said about chat gpt when it first came out um not i don't see it as much these days but when it
[6323.78 --> 6328.18]  first came out was that this was going to replace search not in its current iteration and the biggest
[6328.18 --> 6333.46]  reason why is its main data set is from 2021. you can find more recent stuff on it and there is some more
[6333.46 --> 6338.26]  recent stuff on it but it wasn't trained as extensively on recent stuff and it's not it's
[6338.26 --> 6343.06]  not able to search the internet uh it's not searching more modern things on the internet
[6343.06 --> 6351.78]  etc etc so with proper internet integration um or if like microsoft does the internet stuff like maybe
[6351.78 --> 6356.90]  chat gpt doesn't search the internet but bing does look a little bit and gets some resources and and
[6356.90 --> 6364.90]  uh supplements your input and then spits an output from chat gpt for you um also um
[6366.50 --> 6372.02]  what's it called 4.0 the thing that it's running on currently starting on 3.0 yeah um
[6374.10 --> 6381.94]  the like engine that runs the large language model that's just gpt4 gpt yeah yeah gpt3 is what we're
[6381.94 --> 6388.90]  currently using gpt4 is coming and it's a massive massive massive massive improvement so if they
[6388.90 --> 6393.86]  launch this with gpt4 and it has some ability to scrape things from the internet whether that's bing
[6393.86 --> 6402.90]  feeding it information or what um it's gonna be wild like bing could literally wait like overnight yeah
[6404.18 --> 6408.42]  and meanwhile google search is i swear it's getting worse feels like it's getting worse all the time
[6408.42 --> 6415.14]  there there is there is and i know some people can be like google has stuff too yes google has large
[6415.14 --> 6419.22]  language models google has these types of things yeah but google seems to be also intentionally
[6419.22 --> 6426.10]  making your search results worse but that i feel like microsoft wants to win enough that they won't do
[6426.10 --> 6431.22]  it yet yet and then they'll win and then they'll do it because this is how everything works yeah but
[6431.22 --> 6436.82]  like in the short term i feel like they're they're gonna focus on it being really good yeah
[6436.82 --> 6443.30]  jaden says in chat chat gpt actually gives me freaking answers to my questions as opposed to
[6443.30 --> 6448.26]  google searches where i have to sift through sites disable my ad block see 10 billion ads and then try
[6448.26 --> 6453.22]  to read through an article that wafts for 60 paragraphs blah blah blah have i told you my trick
[6453.22 --> 6459.54]  for reading articles these days i skipped to the third paragraph oh interesting the first two paragraphs
[6459.54 --> 6464.42]  are almost always useless and i learned this from i won't name him but i learned this from a friend of
[6464.42 --> 6472.02]  mine who used to write articles for a website that reviews phones um and oh some people might guess
[6472.02 --> 6479.62]  but uh is this someone i know yeah uh he informed me that a lot of the like the the first bits of
[6479.62 --> 6488.02]  articles are there to make you scroll down so you see more ads yeah because i i told them like oh i do
[6488.02 --> 6492.10]  this thing where i skip to the third paragraph because i feel like that's where the articles often start
[6492.10 --> 6499.38]  right and he's like well yeah sort of like not not i wasn't like exactly on point or whatever the labs
[6499.38 --> 6503.94]  website will not work like that if we have an intro it'll be because that's information you need
[6503.94 --> 6509.86]  yeah okay the labs website in its current form basically has a tldr at the top so it's like almost
[6509.86 --> 6517.86]  the opposite the labs website in its current form is a money losing machine yeah let's go yeah heck yeah
[6517.86 --> 6524.66]  let's go keep buying screwdrivers yeah and backpacks buy lots of backpacks to put your screwdrivers in
[6524.66 --> 6530.74]  yeah yeah this is a lot of topics are we getting through all these uh no i don't think so i'm here
[6530.74 --> 6537.86]  for it i mean oh well i think we have to talk about the um repair shop owners claiming that standing your
[6537.86 --> 6544.18]  ps5 vertically can kill the console whoa yeah that's right many in the repair community have seen the liquid
[6544.18 --> 6549.38]  metal thermal interface material that sony is using leak from between the apu and the cooler
[6550.42 --> 6552.58]  i wonder who could have warned them that this might happen
[6554.74 --> 6562.02]  we killed some stuff we killed a razer phone we killed a really nice laptop i'm pretty sure we killed
[6562.02 --> 6569.46]  a desktop board at some point and the problem is that liquid metal is liquid and gravity works um
[6570.10 --> 6575.46]  this blew up recently from a pair of tweets uh from a french repair technician that has been
[6575.46 --> 6580.90]  discussed in the repair community for some time uh the the coder a youtuber specializing in repairing
[6580.90 --> 6585.30]  consoles posted a video three months ago of him repairing a ps5 that he claims had sat vertically
[6585.30 --> 6592.58]  in its packaging for months and refused to boot once sold in the video he peels the seal around the apu
[6592.58 --> 6598.10]  and shows obvious liquid metal leakage he's able to remove the liquid metal and cover the area around the
[6598.10 --> 6603.86]  apu with conformal coating fixing the issue and he says this is a design flaw on sony's part i actually
[6603.86 --> 6610.74]  don't necessarily agree with that assessment the correct design would seal in the liquid metal properly
[6610.74 --> 6619.14]  so that it doesn't leak out at all not to conformal coat anywhere that it could leak onto um conformal coating
[6619.14 --> 6627.38]  is a band-aid not a real solution in my in my opinion um i mean obviously especially because you might
[6627.38 --> 6634.34]  manipulate the object yeah in in well okay the idea is that the conformal coating is around it in all
[6634.34 --> 6643.22]  directions so that if it does leak it won't actually uh bridge any contacts and cause a short right but by
[6643.22 --> 6647.38]  that time you've kind of already lost the game you're just kind of delaying the inevitable until you can
[6647.38 --> 6651.14]  formal coat the entire inside and at that point why don't we just put in a liquid metal bath
[6652.26 --> 6659.06]  right i'm i'm obviously being facetious at this point but i just i think that a better seal is the
[6659.06 --> 6664.66]  better solution um another french repair shop posted about this leakage issue on facebook back in august
[6664.66 --> 6670.58]  and october of this year uh playstation focused news site push square called these reports questionable
[6670.58 --> 6676.10]  and claimed that those discussing the issue uh are saying something bad needs to happen to the seal
[6676.10 --> 6682.90]  protecting it for this to happen uh okay yeah the discussion question is what should sony have done
[6683.46 --> 6690.74]  i mean i don't know because i'm not an engineer and i don't know the right solution for sealing liquid
[6690.74 --> 6694.82]  metal i know that asus has been using it in their laptops for a while to my knowledge there's no
[6694.82 --> 6701.30]  widespread failures but i'd love to yeah i'd love to hear from you guys if you if you know of anyone
[6701.30 --> 6711.78]  who has done liquid metal well replace it replace your ps5 head gasket every 20 000 miles a pugnan all
[6711.78 --> 6718.50]  suggests maybe maybe it's a time thing maybe if we went back to before 1655 we wouldn't have this problem
[6718.50 --> 6723.94]  before sir isaac newton discovered gravity oh nice yeah yeah then it wouldn't leak that makes sense that
[6723.94 --> 6730.34]  seems pretty good yeah uh in the meantime if you have a playstation 5 maybe lay it flat cool
[6732.90 --> 6739.54]  um let's do amd finally admits the rx 7900 xtx overheating was caused by a defective vapor chamber
[6740.18 --> 6746.50]  amd finally admitted that the overheating issue affecting radeon rx 7900 xtx graphics cards is caused
[6746.50 --> 6752.90]  by a manufacturing defect womp womp the admission comes yeah there's a lot in here but basically
[6752.90 --> 6758.82]  der bauer did a good job and amd says they'll replace any affected cards hey the issue is they're
[6758.82 --> 6764.02]  apparently very low on stock because they actually made a good gpu for a change so that's tough that's
[6764.02 --> 6771.46]  a tough situation um let's do some merch messages yeah okay all right let's get you some here
[6771.46 --> 6778.10]  first one's from anonymous luke or linus hey i liked that hack you did by the way big fan
[6780.34 --> 6784.90]  there's a lot of them it's a very common name i think well they're they're just super into ltt
[6784.90 --> 6789.94]  they're really technical yeah okay those folks uh luke or linus what are your thoughts about pen test
[6789.94 --> 6794.98]  learning tools like flipper zero becoming more available to individuals with the intent to meme
[6794.98 --> 6802.74]  or troll definitely anonymous uh flippers can read nfc copy slash replicate key fobs and emit ir signals
[6802.74 --> 6809.30]  there's been there's been tools uh that you could use maliciously available to everyone on the planet
[6809.30 --> 6817.06]  uh since humans started making tools um i don't think that's a a hammer is a malicious tool if you use it
[6817.06 --> 6824.42]  to pry open a door yeah like i i don't think uh being all concerned about people having access to
[6824.42 --> 6832.82]  flipper zeros and and doing trolly things with it is is a a good or legitimate argument um i think it's
[6832.82 --> 6840.50]  really cool um that someone who might be interested in uh learning how to defend against those types of
[6840.50 --> 6846.90]  attacks or someone who might be interested in working on uh pen testing or a pen testing career
[6847.54 --> 6851.46]  or whatever even if you're just interested in in checking out what vulnerabilities your own
[6851.46 --> 6856.26]  workplace or your own personal setup or whatever might have i think it's very cool that people
[6856.26 --> 6863.54]  can have access to um a device like a flipper zero i think flipper zeros are are fantastic um and they're
[6865.38 --> 6875.30]  yeah they're just cool yeah could i use man you can do lots with them he fobs suck is there a device
[6875.30 --> 6881.78]  that you could use it like that will like clone your key fob because the key fob for my new car is huge
[6881.78 --> 6889.14]  it's horrible and now that um now that there's three cars that i could potentially have to drive oh so
[6889.14 --> 6893.30]  you want to be able to like switch which one it is and then i only want one like how's that not a
[6893.30 --> 6900.66]  product and i understand why it's not a product but like oh if carjackers have them then i want them
[6900.66 --> 6906.66]  for real though no i hear you i've got a flipper zero on my desk we could try it yeah might be uh
[6906.66 --> 6910.98]  might be a fun thing to do yeah lots you can there might be uh there might be some some wear and tear
[6910.98 --> 6914.50]  on the vehicle once you're done trying it is that is that where we're going with this i was gonna let
[6914.50 --> 6924.50]  you play with it but okay uh im jack b keeps releasing really cool payloads for uh flipper zero
[6924.50 --> 6931.14]  as well uh i think you guys featured him in a video fairly recently uh because of contributions that he
[6931.14 --> 6937.70]  made as well um but yeah i'll check him out he makes really good videos too um but like what i was
[6937.70 --> 6946.26]  technically just referring to was his github page uh but he makes cool videos etc etc um there's lots
[6946.26 --> 6950.90]  of cool things you can do with it it's a very interesting field um to start messing around with
[6950.90 --> 6958.10]  if you are interested in in tech so yeah i would not discourage it there's like there's always been
[6958.10 --> 6966.02]  stuff you used to be able to buy these flash drives um from oh i'm not gonna be able to remember
[6966.02 --> 6972.50]  the company name but they had they had us uh uh a slide out there wasn't a ton of flash drives at
[6972.50 --> 6978.02]  the time that had that it was like retractable i had no idea whatever it doesn't matter but they had
[6978.02 --> 6983.94]  they had a thing i don't remember what it's called but it would it would open a prompt when you plugged
[6983.94 --> 6988.50]  it into your computer and it was like it was supposed to emulate like a cd or something i don't
[6988.50 --> 6993.06]  remember what it was but there was crazy amounts of payloads you could just deploy through that
[6993.06 --> 7002.18]  and you could buy those at like best buy it's just a flash drive huh and and and you just download
[7002.18 --> 7008.98]  payloads offline i think they were called uh switchblade and hacksaw back in the day um hack5 rubber
[7008.98 --> 7017.62]  ducky yeah yeah yeah yeah um like these these are people can make malicious tools out of whatever yeah
[7017.62 --> 7022.58]  like they're man imagine the kinds of malicious tools they could make if they had a hammer that
[7022.58 --> 7029.14]  turned into a crowbar i checked for updates on that recently there are none um i wonder if we ever
[7029.14 --> 7034.90]  reached out and offered to buy them no did we not you told me to and i decided not to do it i'm messaging
[7034.90 --> 7045.62]  nick oh my goodness oh it's it's so stupid i don't want to i don't want to do it it's not even like
[7045.62 --> 7049.86]  a very anyways i'm not going to get too far into it you're just sending the email anyways so it
[7049.86 --> 7055.14]  doesn't matter oh yeah i'm not listening to you even a little i'm messaging nick and kyle so you know
[7055.14 --> 7064.50]  i'm really serious damn it oh no oh man maybe there's a reason why it's been in product development
[7065.30 --> 7073.94]  maybe for like what like 10 years maybe we shouldn't take this on or maybe we who took three years to
[7073.94 --> 7079.70]  build a screwdriver have just the kind of tenacity that it takes to push this thing over the finish line
[7079.70 --> 7087.70]  a screwdriver is like a product that exists yeah a a hammer that splits in half and is a crowbar and
[7087.70 --> 7095.06]  is a wrench and is all these other types of things that sounds cool let's make it oh i am so sorry kyle i tried
[7095.06 --> 7102.26]  hit me dan i'll take i'll take two uh here's one from arturo uh linus you had your steam deck for a while
[7102.26 --> 7107.22]  how do you feel about the gilly kit outer dead zone i find that it defeats the whole purpose of
[7107.22 --> 7115.78]  the product sad face i don't daily drive the one that got the gilly kit um sticks in it i did not
[7115.78 --> 7121.62]  know about the outer dead zone on their hall effect joysticks i will have to get back to you on that um
[7121.62 --> 7126.66]  or i probably won't get back to you on that but i will keep that in mind next time i'm looking at a
[7126.66 --> 7132.42]  a hall effect joystick particularly one from gilly kit i didn't notice uh but i only i only used that
[7132.42 --> 7138.50]  in the time you guys saw me use it uh that's the like modded steam deck that lives here with the like
[7139.22 --> 7144.10]  heat sink hanging off the back of it and stuff no one daily drives that it's more of like a prop at
[7144.10 --> 7152.58]  this point got one here from william hi i'm hi love from taiwan how do you feel about the tsmc renewed
[7152.58 --> 7158.66]  additional 28 billion investment in its arizona fab plant and how is it going to affect the chip
[7158.66 --> 7168.82]  production industry it's tms uh it's cut off here sorry um it will lower prices which will be good for
[7168.82 --> 7176.98]  us will it well it depends if china demand is so high it just won't matter well demand is not that
[7176.98 --> 7182.26]  high for cutting edge nodes okay cutting edge which is interesting like why does it keep running into
[7182.26 --> 7191.62]  me thank you where did it even go um in your crotch actually it's right oh yeah yeah it's right buddy
[7191.62 --> 7198.74]  yeah it's right there how's it going friendo it's uh yep it's in his crotch okay cool so anyway um
[7198.74 --> 7207.54]  um i mean we've we've we've seen that apparently the latest nodes are um not even necessarily
[7208.66 --> 7213.86]  shrinking the same way that they used to i think it was uh caches are not really are not really getting
[7213.86 --> 7219.46]  smaller uh on on like the the latest shrinks you'll have to forgive me this is stuff that i haven't like
[7219.46 --> 7223.46]  prepared i didn't get ready to make a video about it or anything i think it's for an anometer or something
[7223.46 --> 7227.86]  like that from tsmc where they're basically saying like yeah caches aren't going to get smaller so
[7228.74 --> 7235.46]  cool so your compute will your logic will but your caches won't um so we're we're already seeing
[7236.18 --> 7241.54]  amd release products that are using chiplets that are built on a variety of nodes because only some
[7241.54 --> 7246.50]  of their functions are benefiting from these shrinks so with that in mind if the industry is moving
[7246.50 --> 7252.98]  towards chiplet based designs demand for these these these top tier top spec nodes could actually go
[7252.98 --> 7260.98]  down yeah uh gpu sales are at their lowest in like ever or something like that not not ever but in
[7260.98 --> 7268.50]  in a very long time um and so phone socs apparently qualcomm is on the fence as to whether or not they
[7268.50 --> 7274.90]  will even use um uh four nanometer this year i think it's four and i think it's i think it's uh four
[7274.90 --> 7282.74]  nanometer from tsmc i think apple's locked in but like basically nobody else is right now so obviously
[7282.74 --> 7287.86]  i you know love to see more capacity because theoretically that means lower prices for
[7287.86 --> 7293.22]  consumers but if they get bit really hard on this it could slow down development in the future then
[7293.22 --> 7297.78]  again intel is going to be breathing down their throat theoretically with their like third-party fab
[7298.42 --> 7307.86]  business all right okay this one's from eric hey guys mkbhd released a video lately addressing how
[7307.86 --> 7313.70]  iphone cameras are getting worse over time tldr post-processing ruined smartphone photos which i
[7313.70 --> 7320.42]  personally agree what do you guys think i mean what else do you want them to do they can't put a big fat
[7320.42 --> 7328.82]  sensor in it well they can actually um okay you think they should just stagnate well no i think
[7328.82 --> 7338.98]  adding more post-processing which uh could potentially ruin photos or whatever uh is is actually good or is
[7338.98 --> 7346.82]  it just a marketing attempt to move it forward yeah i mean i never use like um heavily computational
[7346.82 --> 7353.30]  photo modes like i i never use things like portrait mode or anything like that so uh
[7355.86 --> 7364.82]  but on the other hand i can under ideal conditions they they can outperform a less assisted um photo
[7364.82 --> 7369.46]  pipeline so i don't know what the right answer is here guys to be perfectly honest with you
[7370.50 --> 7375.78]  i mean bigger sensors yeah but the thing about bigger sensors is bigger sensors cost money on every
[7375.78 --> 7382.98]  device better software costs money once yeah and then you can have cheaper devices so obviously
[7382.98 --> 7393.06]  that's the route that apple prefers but i don't i don't see an obvious solution here okay this one's
[7393.06 --> 7400.66]  from eric hi luke and linus have you guys seen any of the rumors for the next gpus after the 7900s if so
[7400.66 --> 7406.10]  what are your thoughts on them and do you think they have a chance to beat nvidia i don't know i've
[7406.10 --> 7411.06]  never cared about rumor mill stuff yeah that's that's such a long way off i think there's just nothing
[7411.06 --> 7421.86]  to really talk about at this point yeah sorry xxx explosive xxx asks the most hell yeah 2008 username
[7421.86 --> 7426.66]  yeah play some call of duty ever yeah hi linus happy new year and what are your goals for the
[7426.66 --> 7435.62]  company here in 2023 um my goals are really focused on labs this year i think that i've made that
[7435.62 --> 7444.26]  abundantly clear throughout the show uh pretty much every other part of the company is tied into labs in
[7444.26 --> 7450.50]  some way whether it's creator warehouse um creating merch around the lab or with the help of the lab like
[7450.50 --> 7457.06]  labs exists to test things for ourselves internally as well uh whether it's floatplane you know float
[7457.06 --> 7463.94]  plane's potential biggest customer becoming the labs website uh whether it's ltt leaning on labs data for
[7463.94 --> 7471.54]  much much better videos uh i i loved our 4070 ti review i think there's things that we can improve
[7471.54 --> 7476.58]  in the video format i think that retention wasn't as high as i'd like to see so there's probably some
[7476.58 --> 7480.42]  things that we can cut once we have supplementary reading and we can just kind of point people to
[7480.42 --> 7486.82]  that if they want more detail and we can do more of a tldr style video but man the detail that we had
[7486.82 --> 7493.30]  the the data we had the the how early we knew what our angle was going to be for it compared to when we
[7493.30 --> 7499.30]  were trying to do all the testing ourselves with the writing team was awesome that's the bar that we
[7499.30 --> 7507.22]  want to be at for any of our editorial content and it's not going to happen overnight um yeah it's not
[7507.22 --> 7511.94]  going to happen overnight but in time man this kind of stuff that we're working on whether it's
[7512.50 --> 7519.46]  um automating the creation of graphs or whether it's a better automating our test processes uh we're
[7519.46 --> 7524.58]  we're working on uh actually this will be a video so we're we're going to be doing a video where we
[7524.58 --> 7530.18]  get a whole bunch of the same cpu and like source them from all kinds of different places samples from
[7530.18 --> 7536.82]  intel buying them from new egg buying them here in retail in canada waiting a month doing all the same
[7536.82 --> 7541.62]  all of those again to make sure that these are from different batches produced at different times
[7541.62 --> 7547.78]  sent to different places and then what we want to do is we want to put them all on in the same
[7547.78 --> 7552.82]  motherboard and see what the performance differences are because if we could parallelize our testing
[7552.82 --> 7559.70]  more man we could do a lot of testing but we need to know if they actually perform the same before we
[7559.70 --> 7568.82]  can just set up a bunch of parallel test benches right exciting hey hayden asks hey guys any tips
[7568.82 --> 7574.26]  on how to run an efficient pre-production meeting i work as a technical director for a local news station
[7574.26 --> 7578.82]  and it can be challenging to get everyone on the same page for our daily show curious to hear how you
[7578.82 --> 7587.54]  plan slash coordinate before you're shooting content um that's an interesting question a pre-production
[7587.54 --> 7594.66]  meeting i mean tips for running uh an efficient meeting in general are just cut out anything that
[7594.66 --> 7600.58]  you don't have to do um as for getting everyone on the same page i feel like this is one of those
[7600.58 --> 7605.70]  things that i i honestly have a bit of a blind spot for at this point i've been in charge for so long
[7605.70 --> 7612.42]  that i kind of forget um how hard it is to build consensus if you're not if your name isn't on the building
[7612.42 --> 7618.02]  and i don't i the the point of this is not for you guys to go oh no this is so out of touch the
[7618.02 --> 7627.22]  point is that i'm telling you that i i don't really know how to do that anymore like i'll ask questions
[7628.02 --> 7634.50]  oh okay actually okay there yeah asking questions uh getting people's input um demonstrating that you've
[7634.50 --> 7640.66]  heard it and then setting a course so that's the part that i i was gonna say i think i think it's more
[7640.66 --> 7646.98]  course setting here you guys plan out what people are going to work on then trust they're going to
[7646.98 --> 7653.06]  work on it fairly well and then at the very end you have like script review and then it's out yeah
[7656.02 --> 7663.38]  i didn't even know we planned things here hey okay moving on from richard hi ltt after watching the bts
[7663.38 --> 7668.98]  vid you put on youtube i might need to get a flow plane sub now do you find it hard to build a team
[7668.98 --> 7674.42]  of both people who are interested both in technology and people who are interested in making videos
[7675.06 --> 7679.14]  yeah it can be tough i mean some of our hiring practices have been controversial and we've
[7679.14 --> 7687.30]  talked about them on the show i mean i yeah well that was that that was bad um but i'm i'm talking
[7687.30 --> 7692.90]  specifically about how like we don't like to discuss salary until we've already figured out if we think
[7692.90 --> 7696.98]  someone's going to be a good fit if they're going to be passionate about the work just because we want
[7696.98 --> 7701.06]  people who are passionate doesn't mean we don't want to pay them well it just means that we want
[7701.06 --> 7706.34]  people who are passionate like i'll see people talk about that in in the chat they'll be like i've never
[7706.34 --> 7712.82]  worked for a company that's that's like that and it's like good go away i don't want you here no
[7712.82 --> 7718.26]  problem um like i said the point and and i get it people have probably been burned by stuff like that
[7718.26 --> 7722.90]  before like oh anytime you hear someone talk about how we want to run it more like a family business red
[7722.90 --> 7728.34]  flag red flag red flag red flag yeah yeah sure yeah that's that's fair that's you know in a lot
[7728.34 --> 7733.70]  of ways that's just coded language for we want you to work for free like our family members would i get
[7733.70 --> 7741.86]  it yeah but that's how we did it we found people who are who would do it anyway and then paid them to
[7741.86 --> 7751.46]  do it better and do it more like i i don't know what to tell you yeah got an anonymous question here
[7751.46 --> 7756.66]  i've been working in startups for nearly 10 years and dealing with vcs always hold on hold on i love
[7756.66 --> 7761.22]  this the badger hound yeah that's a demonstrably awful hiring practice compensation should be in
[7761.22 --> 7767.54]  the ad good for you it's demonstrably worked great for us demonstrably is a word that actually has a
[7767.54 --> 7773.86]  meaning well my example and i always like apologize when we get to this part of the call but my example
[7773.86 --> 7779.38]  that i give is is for development hiring you can maybe guess by looking at our audience that there might
[7779.38 --> 7785.54]  be a lot of developers in the audience so when we put up jobs for developers uh one of the positions
[7785.54 --> 7792.18]  in particular got over 10 000 applications they don't always get that it got that because there
[7792.18 --> 7797.30]  was a shout out in a video usually what's right more realistic is a little bit less than a thousand
[7797.30 --> 7804.58]  but still like tons and i want the best person potential for the job so that's actually a pretty
[7804.58 --> 7809.78]  wide range there's a lot of potential solutions there also if i'm hiring a a bunch of people
[7809.78 --> 7815.38]  like when we did the first wave of hiring for the whole labs web dev team it's like okay i actually do
[7815.38 --> 7824.02]  sort of have a budget this time that was a first but i have a budget for the team yeah i don't know how
[7824.02 --> 7828.90]  this is gonna land maybe someone's a superstar i don't want to bring them in so i would want to
[7828.90 --> 7833.70]  increase the budget for that role i don't want to put out a fixed budget because maybe i get a melting
[7833.70 --> 7837.38]  pot of people that i think are going to be a really really good solution and this person's a
[7837.38 --> 7843.46]  super junior and this person's very very superstar yeah like and and maybe i i have really really high
[7843.46 --> 7847.22]  hopes for this junior but they are a junior they're not going to be able to contribute a ton immediately
[7847.22 --> 7850.42]  or or or whatever like there's a bunch of different reasons why you might take in different
[7850.42 --> 7857.30]  people at different rates you sound very anti anti-worker right now do i believe it or not yeah
[7857.30 --> 7863.14]  you've actually you you've become like management which is really funny to me um one of the one of the
[7863.14 --> 7868.42]  articles that was an option for us to talk about on the show today was about the some of the new laws
[7868.42 --> 7876.74]  in the states about advertising salary ranges in your want ads um and how i do companies are skirting
[7876.74 --> 7885.86]  them yeah so uh netflix famously uh put up a posting for a job that had a salary range from sixty thousand
[7885.86 --> 7890.74]  dollars a year to i think either five hundred or six hundred thousand dollars a year but the funny
[7890.74 --> 7898.34]  thing is and in that space hold on hold on the thing people were outraged about was that that leaves
[7898.34 --> 7904.02]  room for discrimination people could have the same job and the same responsibilities but at wildly
[7904.02 --> 7908.42]  different pay but that's the thing you got to understand just because they have the same job title
[7908.42 --> 7912.82]  don't mean they have the same responsibilities doesn't mean they have the same experience doesn't
[7912.82 --> 7920.42]  mean they're gonna have the same output so i see it from both sides here um you can i see i i see it
[7920.42 --> 7926.02]  from both sides here yeah i i get it i get it as well it would be annoying it would be a lot if i was
[7926.02 --> 7932.66]  looking for jobs it would be a lot clearer if i knew what the salary range or exact salary was for that
[7932.66 --> 7938.82]  potential job but then i also understand netflix posting that because that i think you mentioned it
[7938.82 --> 7944.10]  might be trolling it might not be no no i didn't say it was trolling okay no that might be totally
[7944.10 --> 7949.70]  legit because they might be interested in bringing in juniors yep maybe juniors that don't even have
[7949.70 --> 7955.22]  very much education at all or potentially like basically none and or very much experience or
[7955.22 --> 7960.50]  potentially basically none and netflix might be interested in like okay this person seems very
[7960.50 --> 7964.58]  driven and interested in some video stuff or whatever we want to bring them on but then there might
[7964.58 --> 7969.06]  be some superstar engineer from somewhere else and that might cost a ton and they might be interested
[7969.06 --> 7974.10]  in them too so like i don't know this is great uh every once in a while twitch chat says something
[7974.10 --> 7980.98]  brilliant this ain't it king canada live output is largely dictated by operating conditions provided
[7980.98 --> 7986.42]  by the employer that shouldn't be measured against salary if the operating conditions you're a idiot
[7986.42 --> 7994.42]  if the operation if the operating conditions are the same across the board then i don't necessarily see
[7994.42 --> 8005.46]  how that applies what have you ever met another human being no honestly though you don't think that
[8005.46 --> 8012.74]  there could possibly be some output difference under the same conditions between two people i think he was
[8012.74 --> 8019.06]  saying differing conditions but i don't see it output is largely dictated by the operating conditions
[8019.06 --> 8023.46]  provided by the employer yeah that's what i'm saying that shouldn't be measured against salary but he
[8023.46 --> 8029.94]  didn't necessarily so your output and your salary should just be disconnected because it's your fault as
[8029.94 --> 8039.46]  the employer if their output sucks well it could be it could be but also um no i do i do think company and
[8039.46 --> 8046.74]  conditions play a lot in the in the role of output but if but if your conditions are are similar across
[8046.74 --> 8057.70]  the company then the opportunity for output should be unbelievable yeah yeah yeah yeah
[8059.94 --> 8064.98]  okay well let's get back to our venture capital yeah going from some money stuff i've been working on
[8064.98 --> 8069.14]  startups for nearly 10 years and dealing with venture capitals i assume that's what a vc is
[8069.14 --> 8074.10]  yeah always burns me out how do you guys keep going when business development shenanigans keep you
[8074.10 --> 8081.22]  down but don't deal with vcs yeah that was actually i i think i'm the one who curated this and that's
[8081.22 --> 8088.66]  what i was gonna say uh deal every i just i i was stuck at a at a table at like a social event with
[8088.66 --> 8096.02]  someone who worked as like a like a vc person like you know finding companies to fund and getting funding
[8096.02 --> 8103.14]  whatever and just like even just socially i couldn't stand it just like and to be clear they were like
[8103.14 --> 8107.62]  nice enough but just anytime they talked about that stuff i was just like oh i hate it i just hate
[8107.62 --> 8118.18]  everything about it um yeah okay this one's from pascal hey luke i'm a freelance back-end of programmer
[8118.18 --> 8123.38]  and hope to someday get hired by a real company what are your fears hiring a programmer with close
[8123.38 --> 8129.70]  to no experience working in a team uh the first non-infrastructure hire that i had was a programmer
[8129.70 --> 8137.78]  with uh little to no experience working with in a team and he's fantastic and he's still around
[8138.42 --> 8143.86]  you're saying you don't have fears about that there are fears um there are concerns but there's concerns
[8143.86 --> 8154.58]  with everything um so like i don't know um try to do okay you're not the hiring person i see this is
[8154.58 --> 8161.78]  framed so if you as the person doing the hiring try to do your job as well as you can well i guess you
[8161.78 --> 8165.78]  might do the hiring and not be the manager whatever so the person managing that person needs to try to do
[8165.78 --> 8173.46]  their job as well as possible and train that person to work in a team well um and as the person being
[8173.46 --> 8179.78]  hired try to be receptive to how the team works when you show up um try to work well within that
[8179.78 --> 8183.86]  team structure and then once you've been there for a bit if you have ideas and suggestions how they can
[8183.86 --> 8190.18]  change then forward those but try to get used to the structure that's there first um yeah i don't know
[8190.18 --> 8195.70]  there's you got to start somewhere someone has to pick you up uh and there's there's benefits to it
[8195.70 --> 8201.30]  as the company because then you get to kind of help mold this person into working the way that your
[8201.30 --> 8206.58]  company works and uh there's negatives to it because maybe they won't maybe they'll clash with
[8206.58 --> 8211.22]  other members or maybe they'll they'll be really difficult to communicate with or whatever but try
[8211.22 --> 8215.62]  to work on those things a lot of people are receptive to that kind of stuff people don't
[8216.18 --> 8222.34]  usually in my experience like being really bad at things so i don't know yeah
[8224.74 --> 8230.50]  okay i've got one here from scott your line of work means you get my you must deal with a lot of
[8230.50 --> 8236.26]  useless criticism but it can't be all bad what's the most helpful constructive criticism you have
[8236.26 --> 8240.98]  received from your community ps thanks for making a backpack that will fit all the tools i need to
[8240.98 --> 8248.26]  work in an it closet nice um helpful constructive criticism i i don't know if i could pick a single
[8248.26 --> 8254.10]  helpful constructive criticism because a lot of it's just like so specific it's like there's no one
[8254.10 --> 8260.34]  piece of there's no one comment i ever read on youtube that was like oh yeah big course correction
[8261.70 --> 8267.06]  let's go in this direction but there's absolutely been a bunch of constructive criticism it's a thousand
[8267.06 --> 8275.46]  it's a thousand little nudges every day and and it's more like it's more like today there were 600 that
[8275.46 --> 8280.42]  pushed this way and 400 that pushed this way so we're kind of going a bit more this way and then over
[8280.42 --> 8286.02]  time it looks like we over corrected so we need to actually go back out this way like it's um i don't
[8286.02 --> 8299.46]  know part of what makes me able to do my job is that it's um is that i i just try to look at this gigantic
[8299.46 --> 8307.70]  cloud of data points and find a pattern in it and i think i'm kind of able to do that okay i don't i
[8307.70 --> 8311.30]  don't think i'm great at it there's definitely people who are better at it but i think i'm kind
[8311.30 --> 8323.30]  of okay at it yeah wrong one okay i got one here from patrick my son's birthday is coming up he wants
[8323.30 --> 8328.58]  a new gaming computer he has shown interest in electronics and wants to put it together himself
[8328.58 --> 8333.78]  is there any company or manufacturer that sells kits with pre-selected parts to build your own computer at
[8333.78 --> 8343.46]  home uh i didn't think so no i thought this was an interesting not to my knowledge uh ncix tried to
[8343.46 --> 8347.62]  do it at one point but it just wasn't feasible because the whole point of a custom computer is
[8347.62 --> 8352.90]  that you pick all your own crap and as soon as you start trying to make it kind of pre-done for you
[8353.46 --> 8359.30]  it's like oh well i want that but like could i change the ram and then it's not really pre-done and
[8359.30 --> 8366.58]  it becomes really high touch is what we called it there's there's there's solutions though um i i
[8366.58 --> 8373.54]  feel like i haven't talked about them in forever but nzt apparently has a kit nzt bld build yeah is
[8373.54 --> 8376.66]  that a kit though is build a kit
[8380.02 --> 8385.38]  yeah so conrad just suggested exactly what i was going to suggest basically pc part picker has
[8385.38 --> 8393.78]  pre-made lists you could just order that or like go on the uh that won't have instructions though i
[8393.78 --> 8397.86]  think they're kind of hoping for instructions instructions well yeah if it's like okay so
[8397.86 --> 8403.22]  order that and then watch the ltd video that anthony made which is like the only build guide you'll ever
[8403.22 --> 8408.74]  need and then combine those two and then you're good that's fair um the the other thing i was going to
[8408.74 --> 8417.22]  bring up is the build a pc subreddit or the uh pc build planning part of the the forum there's there's
[8417.22 --> 8420.66]  lots of resources out there where people will effectively give you a list of parts to buy
[8421.22 --> 8426.98]  um the pc part picker one i'm pretty sure you can literally just like add all to cart and then buy and
[8426.98 --> 8437.30]  it'll work so it's an option next up i got one here from jacob why does nvidia and amd utilize third-party
[8437.30 --> 8441.94]  manufacturing of gpus instead of only in-house production wouldn't it be a better business
[8441.94 --> 8449.54]  decision similar to cpu production being only in-house but riskier that's the danger obviously
[8449.54 --> 8456.90]  wouldn't it be a better business decision for us to build out injection molding facilities and uh you
[8456.90 --> 8461.86]  know metal tooling facilities that are mass production capable if we're going to build a screwdriver
[8461.86 --> 8468.98]  software i mean we'd probably get our per unit costs down eventually but only if we were doing
[8468.98 --> 8475.38]  just wild amounts of volume by comparison if we just go to companies that specialize in these things a they
[8475.38 --> 8480.42]  have the experience b they have the equipment and c they have the volume because of all their other
[8480.42 --> 8487.06]  customers that it actually ends up being probably more cost effective and we don't have to make all
[8487.06 --> 8493.78]  those investments up front someone else you know bought or leased that equipment 5 10 maybe even 20
[8493.78 --> 8500.50]  years ago in some cases so it's like completely paid off and we're just renting time on it effectively so
[8502.26 --> 8507.78]  this is a simplified example but it's fundamentally the same thing that's why amd divested themselves of
[8507.78 --> 8514.66]  their foundry business and it seems to be doing all the better for it meanwhile intel fabs all their own
[8514.66 --> 8519.38]  chips and chips and has been struggling like a you know mf-er yeah
[8522.66 --> 8528.90]  this one's from aj i'm currently at work running an smt slash aio machine while watching wad how did
[8528.90 --> 8533.86]  you like running an smt machine and making your own ram at micron oh it was awesome was that the first
[8533.86 --> 8540.74]  time you've ever seen the process no no the first time i saw the process was at um meridian actually i
[8540.74 --> 8545.70]  think that was the first time i saw it up close because they they make all the boards for their
[8545.70 --> 8552.82]  audio products in-house um because they apparently haven't learned about the benefits of working with
[8552.82 --> 8558.90]  third parties um and their products are really expensive go figure uh so no that wasn't the
[8558.90 --> 8563.22]  first time i've ever seen it but it was the first time i've ever gotten to to run the machinery and like
[8563.22 --> 8568.58]  really like poke and prod at it and get all the solder paste um in the right spots and all that kind of
[8568.58 --> 8571.30]  stuff it was it was the exactly the kind of thing that i geek out over
[8574.66 --> 8580.34]  all right got one here from andrew hi linus and luke watcher since the million subscriber days if given
[8580.34 --> 8585.46]  the choice today provided that you keep all your current memories would you go back 10 years and
[8585.46 --> 8591.78]  repeat those years again would you do anything different i don't think i would want to do it again
[8591.78 --> 8602.74]  10 years of lmg man i would unquestionably go back i would press that button immediately really oh yeah
[8602.74 --> 8609.14]  what would you change like hard i'd potentially break it would you keep your current body or the
[8609.14 --> 8615.70]  10 year ago body add a modifier to that is that is that a question yeah is that part of the question no
[8615.70 --> 8621.54]  it's not okay you you would go back and do it again oh yeah you didn't raise three kids in that
[8621.54 --> 8628.90]  time no right yeah that might change the answer okay yeah but i didn't so like yeah i'm pressing the
[8628.90 --> 8636.58]  button that doesn't that's not on my side of the table i yeah oh yeah and like what would i change
[8636.58 --> 8641.78]  lots of stuff i don't know i don't want to get like too specific but oh yeah like what do you mean
[8641.78 --> 8650.58]  the min maxing opportunities you keep all your memories that's a lot of knowledge yeah like what
[8650.58 --> 8656.58]  if i knew everywhere that things were going to go in the market and stuff and i could set up our like
[8656.58 --> 8664.18]  video production path to be more well aimed like i wouldn't want to make major changes because you
[8664.18 --> 8669.22]  don't want to risk like breaking the whole system okay but here's a hypothetical because i know you've
[8669.22 --> 8675.38]  gone through this before have you ever written a video script lost your save file and gone back
[8675.38 --> 8682.02]  and tried to write it again is it always better oh no that's that's what i'm saying i wouldn't want
[8682.02 --> 8686.18]  to make major changes yeah but how would you avoid it you because that's the problem with trying to
[8686.18 --> 8691.70]  rewrite a script is you don't remember what you did right i'd still do it i'm still doing it i'm still
[8691.70 --> 8696.50]  pressing the button i understand there's problems i'm still doing it there's so much there's so much you
[8696.50 --> 8701.94]  could min max and i think you would create new problems but i think you would solve more problems
[8701.94 --> 8706.18]  than you would create i know there's things i don't i'm not going into it i'm just and there's
[8706.18 --> 8711.06]  no you're not going to peer pressure me into going into it there are things that i would change that
[8711.06 --> 8716.90]  would result in better future unquestionably okay all right and like i think that's got to be true
[8717.62 --> 8725.30]  for pretty much everybody 10 years is a really big amount of time and there's mistakes in that amount
[8725.30 --> 8731.14]  of time yeah so it's conrad i'd press the button and buy bitcoin yeah welcome to now being a multi
[8731.14 --> 8737.78]  billionaire because 10 years ago when we're in the ltd studio at ncx i actually tell us to start
[8737.78 --> 8742.74]  mining like crazy and i don't back down which i very willingly did because i agreed with you that i
[8742.74 --> 8747.14]  thought it was just not going anywhere okay and we start mining like nuts and you and i both put
[8747.14 --> 8752.02]  everything we can in bitcoin what about this now we big ballers see that is not a minor change
[8752.02 --> 8759.46]  that's a major change what if we hold on hold on hold on no come on help me out just bear with me
[8760.42 --> 8768.66]  what if we became total assholes we wouldn't what if we did we wouldn't what if we did i can what if
[8768.66 --> 8773.14]  that amount of money go down that if you want but we would what if that amount of money changed us
[8773.14 --> 8782.02]  you are very wealthy i wasn't gonna go here but you kept pushing it you are very wealthy
[8784.10 --> 8788.58]  all right has it changed you too much we went there i mean you've made the argument that it's
[8788.58 --> 8794.98]  changed me more than you'd like sure okay if we're having this conversation then we're having this
[8794.98 --> 8801.14]  conversation fine let's lay it all on the table i didn't think we were gonna go there well you started
[8801.14 --> 8810.90]  it you started it you started it i don't think it's changed you at the level
[8812.58 --> 8820.58]  that you were basically warning about right there but what if it did you press the button when you said
[8820.58 --> 8827.54]  that look you hold on you've talked about how motivated you are personally by adversity
[8827.54 --> 8834.34]  yeah by having to go hard yeah don't you think that that kind of wealth we're talking billion
[8834.34 --> 8838.98]  dollar wealth potentially don't you think that that would take some of the fun out of it
[8838.98 --> 8845.14]  what if hunting was as simple as just pressing a button and the animal dies i know i know stuff
[8845.14 --> 8847.54]  that i would do with it that would still be motivating
[8847.54 --> 8855.22]  if it's unlimited does that not does that not take out the thrill of the chase though
[8855.22 --> 8860.50]  you know this finances don't interest me a ton yes i do know that so there are things that i would do
[8860.50 --> 8867.30]  with it that i know current people that are billionaires are not doing with it that i would
[8867.30 --> 8872.34]  do with it because i actually like don't really care okay but would we work together on that what if we lost
[8872.34 --> 8880.18]  that there there that's my question i feel like you potentially trade our relationship for a billion
[8880.18 --> 8886.90]  dollars well i feel like we wouldn't and a multiple of my reasons there is again you are very wealthy
[8886.90 --> 8895.94]  you don't have to do this yes at all right you do this because you want to provide these types of
[8895.94 --> 8900.50]  things you're very motivated by the lab because you think the lab should exist well of course it should
[8900.50 --> 8905.30]  you think it's a good resource for like humanity it needs to exist yeah you're gonna not build the
[8905.30 --> 8907.38]  lab because you have a billion dollars well i
[8911.38 --> 8914.90]  you're still gonna build a lab you're still motivated by the same things
[8916.10 --> 8921.54]  but it wouldn't it be boring i don't think it'd be boring i don't think the fight for survival is
[8921.54 --> 8928.18]  what makes us get up in the morning i don't think you're fighting for survival and i'm well not for mine
[8928.18 --> 8934.34]  but that's the thing is if i had a billion dollars then like you wouldn't just give it to everybody
[8934.34 --> 8935.54]  i kind of wouldn't have to care
[8938.18 --> 8942.82]  like it but you also wouldn't just give it to everybody well you've also seen my mentality change
[8942.82 --> 8950.18]  too though like i was i was definitely i i was more of a min maxer in terms of our spend as a company in
[8950.18 --> 8960.42]  the early days yes and i think that admittedly yes i have a significant amount of personal wealth okay
[8961.22 --> 8966.26]  i was i really wasn't trying to i think it's changed my attitude significantly yeah i also think
[8966.26 --> 8971.14]  though that it's to a certain level as companies grow you have to do things that are less efficient
[8971.14 --> 8977.22]  with finances that's true and and that's that's been a really tough thing for both me and yvonne because
[8977.22 --> 8985.46]  me we're and luke even though he's spending my money or whatever right even though he's not spending
[8985.46 --> 8992.74]  money that affects him personally i think luke is probably one of the people i'd say top five for me
[8993.30 --> 8999.86]  one one of the the most affected people by spending not his own money and it's a really valuable trait
[8999.86 --> 9004.82]  and i'm sorry i'm talking about you like you're not here but it's a really valuable trait because people
[9004.82 --> 9012.42]  who spend someone else's money as if it's their own are people who just can see the bigger picture
[9013.06 --> 9021.70]  because the bigger picture is theoretically at some point by improving efficiency it will benefit all
[9021.70 --> 9027.30]  of us and you know what i think there's a lot of people who are cynical and jaded enough from their
[9027.30 --> 9034.50]  real experiences in the world that they don't believe in that anymore but i can tell you for me it's a
[9034.50 --> 9039.86]  really valuable trait because it means that i could trust you to do it maybe not the way i would have
[9039.86 --> 9046.26]  done it but a really good way and it's really hard to find it's super hard to find and companies need
[9046.26 --> 9053.14]  that by the way i want to apologize to the person that i said was dumb apparently they they misphrased
[9053.14 --> 9058.82]  it i i saw their chat that twitch chat just like it was a little much i think you should maybe not read
[9058.82 --> 9064.34]  live chats during the show i just shouldn't read twitch chat floatplane chat's pretty good um but
[9065.06 --> 9069.70]  basically they were they were saying that if you hired a superstar from somewhere else and then they
[9069.70 --> 9074.74]  didn't perform in your environment then that's on you which is an entirely different point
[9077.06 --> 9084.34]  there are aspects to that that could be on you but that's also not entirely on you yes um yeah anywho um
[9084.34 --> 9093.38]  uh so luke would save all the budgies with bitcoin it's probably not entirely untrue um
[9094.74 --> 9099.54]  yeah i don't know i would press it i understand there are pitfalls i do understand there are pitfalls
[9101.06 --> 9106.66]  but i've always had this idea like i if i could go back to being like five
[9106.66 --> 9115.54]  yeah if i somehow knew what i currently know i would do it 100 okay
[9117.86 --> 9123.70]  all right yeah i don't think i would i i told and you know what when this conversation when this
[9123.70 --> 9128.42]  question came in the reason why i looked at you and smiled was i knew you would say no and i knew i
[9128.42 --> 9135.62]  was going to say yes part of it's a philosophical thing for me like i don't believe in regret um i don't
[9135.62 --> 9141.94]  i i i there are certainly things i would have done differently but part of the way that i just like
[9141.94 --> 9148.82]  keep going every day is by looking forward not looking backward and i feel like for me it would
[9148.82 --> 9158.74]  actually be a very demotivating experience to have to live back through um a lot of
[9158.74 --> 9168.90]  yeah i wouldn't want to live it again i get that and i can understand how my stance on it makes it
[9168.90 --> 9175.78]  sound like i live in regret i think living in regret is an extremely bad thing to do and you can't work
[9175.78 --> 9182.34]  that way i don't think it's regret i think it's just desire to like well you're the king of min maxing
[9182.34 --> 9188.02]  exactly i get it it's that it's not regret i think i i think i've done great i'm actually like very happy
[9188.02 --> 9193.54]  with where i'm at and how things are going like i life's good i don't have a lot of regrets made
[9193.54 --> 9198.66]  mistakes but everybody's made mistakes so whatever yeah like it's just so then why why why i think it'd
[9198.66 --> 9205.22]  be fun oh i think it'd be really fun i think the min maxing aspect would be great because i have all
[9205.22 --> 9212.02]  my memories i there's also tons i forgot yeah but i'd i'd screw it up i literally forgot an entire video
[9212.02 --> 9218.10]  we just yeah we just filmed that thing right like i almost certainly i i feel like i would almost
[9218.10 --> 9224.18]  certainly screw it up you think so yeah because there's been so many times that i've been at a
[9224.18 --> 9233.38]  crossroads and i've gone like even knowing the result i could go back and i could take that other
[9233.38 --> 9239.46]  path and it could be worse i think if i think if i was the only one i think what i would do was i
[9239.46 --> 9248.50]  wouldn't tell anyone that you know i wouldn't tell anyone that i know anything okay but then would
[9248.50 --> 9253.14]  that come across like kind of arrogant just like i know and i'm not going to tell you how i know would
[9253.14 --> 9261.14]  you be a different person i don't think so it's it's harder to not change we can't just will ourselves
[9261.14 --> 9266.50]  to be who we want to be i understand and i and i and i didn't to be clear the wording there was specific
[9266.50 --> 9273.30]  i didn't say no i said i didn't think so yeah okay i don't think so i don't know but i don't think
[9273.30 --> 9274.66]  like i i also
[9277.14 --> 9286.98]  i also don't think that your success has changed you i think that you are able to spend a dollar now
[9286.98 --> 9293.06]  without having anxiety i still struggle a little bit i think that's a positive change yeah but i've
[9293.06 --> 9298.02]  i've seen you make frivolous purchases when i met you there was no such thing as a frivolous purchase
[9298.58 --> 9305.46]  like it's different yeah but just like couldn't afford toothpaste but you can be different without
[9305.46 --> 9310.26]  changing yeah i guess is what i'm trying to say and i and i think i think you've done a good job of that
[9310.26 --> 9317.30]  but i think that a billion dollars is a lot it is it is i didn't to be fair when i first said i and my
[9317.30 --> 9323.06]  opinion does not change i i think the the bitcoin thing was conrad's idea i didn't even think about
[9323.06 --> 9328.66]  it yeah but it's a good point and if i did press the button it is probably something that i would do
[9328.66 --> 9333.62]  because yeah if the scenarios are almost identical you and i are going to be in that studio yeah and
[9333.62 --> 9337.30]  we're going to be talking about it's going to be a bunch of gpus sitting there hey do we use these to
[9337.30 --> 9342.50]  my this is a yeah we've talked about this on my show a few times but we had a bunch of really high-end
[9342.50 --> 9350.90]  gpus we had literally these these like multi-platform bench systems yes that are exactly
[9350.90 --> 9354.98]  what people use to mine on sitting there just sitting just sitting and we were like hey we
[9354.98 --> 9359.38]  could do this and we were like lol you know that company doesn't exist anymore anyway so i guess i
[9359.38 --> 9362.10]  can talk about them but we're like we'll just run it in here you get free power
[9364.50 --> 9369.94]  um we've changed a little i like to think neither of us would do that anymore yeah yeah yeah
[9372.74 --> 9378.02]  that's one thing that changed once i had money i insist on paying for things now yes me too
[9378.02 --> 9382.74]  like i actually do insist on paying for things i went back and bought a bunch of games that i
[9382.74 --> 9387.86]  pirated and stuff i did that quite a while ago i've had people i've had people comp try to comp me meals
[9387.86 --> 9393.38]  and i just leave money on the table like i just i i won't i i won't i can afford to pay
[9394.26 --> 9398.66]  my stir in float plane chat said you wouldn't spend the money from bitcoin though so what's the point
[9398.66 --> 9403.54]  uh i wouldn't spend it on myself that's like and i genuinely believe that i actually don't
[9403.54 --> 9407.54]  i actually believe that too yeah i know how much money he makes yeah
[9412.18 --> 9413.22]  this shirt was free
[9415.54 --> 9419.38]  i have new socks i have new socks you did buy new socks i only sort of approve of them
[9419.38 --> 9425.78]  we talked about this after the show literally true i was like full disappointed dad but trying
[9425.78 --> 9431.38]  to be supportive i i like them a little bit less since then but i still like them a lot i was trying
[9431.38 --> 9436.74]  not to be a downer i'm sorry okay that uh yeah this is part of the reason why i would press the button
[9436.74 --> 9441.30]  is because i have always had this stance that it is always better to know painful information is still
[9441.30 --> 9445.70]  better and that's why i'm honest with you because if you were anyone else i would have been like oh my
[9445.70 --> 9454.74]  gosh those are so nice i love them hold on i can actually do that more convincing uh okay no way
[9454.74 --> 9460.66]  after all that after all the time we spent talking about socks you finally did it that was actually
[9460.66 --> 9468.66]  pretty convincing i can usually catch up i there's i have a really hard time watching videos of you when
[9468.66 --> 9475.30]  you're talking about like a product or something that i know you're not interested in because i think you
[9475.30 --> 9480.98]  convince people pretty well but no yeah i see it immediately and then it's like painful for me to
[9480.98 --> 9485.70]  watch because i know it's painful for you so the whole time i'm watching i'm just like oh that's why
[9485.70 --> 9490.26]  i just don't do it anymore yeah it's like there was a while there i think like two three years ago where
[9490.26 --> 9495.46]  you're doing it a lot yeah and like well i was covering what i thought i should be covering yeah notice
[9495.46 --> 9505.14]  i just don't bother reviewing the iphone anymore yeah i don't care it's uh it's an iphone apple by design
[9505.62 --> 9512.02]  makes it change as little as possible generation by generation so that dumb dumbs who can't handle
[9512.02 --> 9519.78]  a button moving are not going to get confused like for real that's actually in the it's it's a core
[9519.78 --> 9524.34]  part of the design philosophy of the product and so it's inherently boring now
[9524.34 --> 9527.46]  yeah um
[9529.94 --> 9535.14]  i don't know like something that i thought of quite a while ago i i know there's a lot of things that i
[9535.14 --> 9540.74]  would do you know how i did it just now though i made what i was talking about something how i felt
[9540.74 --> 9549.14]  instead of the product that's what i did interesting that's what makes it convincing yeah yeah so i mean i
[9549.14 --> 9553.70]  guess what i'm doing right now is i'm outing myself as someone who can lie convincingly which is
[9553.70 --> 9562.10]  bad i already knew that well yeah i guess so i don't want to that's that's that's key and i will
[9562.10 --> 9568.50]  give you this credit i think you very rarely do i only do if i have to so there there's situations
[9568.50 --> 9573.86]  like and honestly a lot of the time i'm really uncomfortable with it but like as an employer you
[9573.86 --> 9581.06]  actually cannot always be honest with someone um like like legally um and it's it's really
[9581.06 --> 9591.38]  frustrating for me one of the ones in particular is that if you in in bc in canada if you dismiss
[9591.38 --> 9600.50]  someone with cause there is a lot more uh legal liability for your company and therefore for your
[9600.50 --> 9607.46]  entire team then if you simply dismiss someone without cause and just like put together a
[9607.46 --> 9614.02]  severance package and be like okay see you later um if they come to you and they say hey what was it
[9614.02 --> 9620.66]  was it my was it my awful performance here was it the time theft i committed here like even if it
[9620.66 --> 9627.14]  doesn't matter how legit the reason is the best thing to do every lawyer i've ever talked to has said
[9627.14 --> 9633.30]  you cannot answer those questions so like from a from a legal liability standpoint i can't give
[9633.30 --> 9643.06]  people honest feedback i like giving honest feedback because i like receiving honest feedback i think that
[9643.06 --> 9649.14]  an environment of openness and honesty is more constructive for everyone involved even if you're
[9649.14 --> 9655.78]  you're partying ways yeah if i was getting dumped by okay let's say my wife divorced me okay let's say
[9655.78 --> 9664.82]  yvonne left me i want to know why i don't want to i don't want to lose a lady like that again if i ever
[9664.82 --> 9674.58]  find one again right so i i find that kind of thing extremely difficult yeah um
[9674.58 --> 9682.18]  yeah i mean i i mean a big part of it too is just i find the truth is just more effective
[9682.82 --> 9688.26]  like if you want to enact any kind of change in your life dishonesty ain't gonna do it
[9689.86 --> 9694.34]  yeah and you can package things better like you don't have to be an ass about it yeah
[9696.10 --> 9701.14]  like that i don't know that's a thing but like or maybe you want to be depends on the context
[9701.14 --> 9705.70]  but like you can you can package things in different ways to try to accomplish different
[9705.70 --> 9712.98]  goals while still being very clear and truthful about what you're saying yeah that went a weird
[9712.98 --> 9718.42]  path but anyways i'd press the button this is great von bauer fiend says big employer talking about time
[9718.42 --> 9728.82]  theft eye roll so what it doesn't exist the other way you've never known anyone who said they worked
[9728.82 --> 9734.66]  eight hours but didn't really yeah you're right that doesn't exist probably cool
[9737.22 --> 9742.82]  uh what was i gonna say oh yeah uh i will also say while saying that i would press the button
[9742.82 --> 9747.54]  and this isn't even i'm not even being judgmental i think it would be very bad for a large amount of
[9747.54 --> 9750.26]  people but i think i would be fine
[9750.26 --> 9759.38]  hit us dan i don't know how this has become how are we gonna follow that one
[9760.82 --> 9768.98]  oh my gosh it's good uh-huh okay this one's from jonathan uh capcom has released two dlcs for monster
[9768.98 --> 9774.34]  hunter that would delete your save if you didn't purchase them twice monster hunter world iceborne and
[9774.34 --> 9781.78]  monster hunter rise sunbreak didn't purchase if you did not that's outrageous it deletes your save
[9782.66 --> 9790.50]  that should be considered time theft i invested i invested my time in this in this save file you
[9790.50 --> 9797.62]  can't you can't hold it hostage that's ridiculous i mean does it surprise us it's capcom like
[9797.62 --> 9806.34]  we we give blizzard a lot of flack and nintendo a lot of flack for being anti-consumer but like
[9807.30 --> 9811.06]  cap capcom should be right there in the conversation they're not exactly
[9812.42 --> 9819.22]  no cap okay thank you get it thank you for that that was really helpful oh shoot i think i just archived
[9819.22 --> 9824.18]  one by accident because dan and i went for the button at the same time uh-oh uh if you do it they moved for
[9824.18 --> 9831.46]  me um yeah and he asked hi linus and luke i'm curious to know how many team members use the 2016
[9831.46 --> 9836.98]  razor blades you gifted around the holidays then best of luck in 2023 mine mine still works your
[9836.98 --> 9840.98]  still works but you don't use it that wasn't the question i don't use it because i was super sketched
[9840.98 --> 9847.14]  out about its looming death because it's pretty old at this point yeah like it's genuinely very old
[9847.14 --> 9855.22]  at this point for a laptop um and i was going on a trip for two weeks and i was yeah sure i'm on
[9855.22 --> 9860.90]  vacation i'm definitely gonna have to work while i'm on the trip um even if it wasn't the work for
[9860.90 --> 9864.50]  the work that i was doing on the trip like even during my vacation portion and i was gonna have to
[9864.50 --> 9869.86]  work so i was like if i'm lugging this around in a bag for two weeks am i convinced it's going to work
[9869.86 --> 9876.34]  the whole time no so i got a different one i don't think anyone still uses them but my uh my
[9876.34 --> 9881.14]  girlfriend uses it now oh okay so it's still still deployed it is still in use yeah uh we've got
[9881.14 --> 9885.30]  a couple good ones here um this is the one i accidentally archived i haven't got my black shaft
[9885.30 --> 9890.26]  driver yet but i know i need these bits as i work in the automation industry any chance of hollow
[9890.26 --> 9896.34]  ground screwdriver bits i have never heard of a hollow ground screwdriver bit but if you contact
[9896.34 --> 9900.90]  ltc support they will eventually they're actually doing a great job they're getting caught up on
[9900.90 --> 9906.10]  tickets um so if you contact ltc support with your suggestion just tell them i said to message
[9906.34 --> 9912.58]  uh forward it to kyle i've basically he has a blank check to get any tooling done or any
[9913.22 --> 9919.94]  any thing any setup done for any bits i want to i want to support every bit so there you go these
[9919.94 --> 9925.86]  are incredible um a hollow ground bit also known as a hollow tip or parallel ground screwdriver the
[9925.86 --> 9931.78]  straight slotted tip fills the screw slot better than the tapered tip on standard screwdrivers for more
[9931.78 --> 9938.26]  torque and less slippage cool that sounds great let's do it um also i've got from idrek kautz over
[9938.26 --> 9944.26]  on floatplane hey linus if i say trust me bro i'm not gonna sue you would you give me honest feedback
[9944.26 --> 9955.14]  after firing me we actually did that once um someone didn't make it here um and i kind of i i for whatever
[9955.14 --> 9960.26]  reason normally it's not actually me anymore like there's multiple layers of management and hr and
[9960.26 --> 9965.38]  stuff at this point so it's almost never me who actually has a dismissal conversation with someone
[9965.38 --> 9972.42]  uh but i i i talked to this person um we we worked directly so that's probably why i don't remember the
[9972.42 --> 9979.30]  details the point is that um i talked to this person uh it was tough conversation because they really just
[9979.30 --> 9986.90]  wanted to do better and i really wanted them to do better i liked them as a person right like it was
[9986.90 --> 9992.98]  it just it just wasn't the right fit and sometimes that happens right and uh they basically were like
[9992.98 --> 9998.90]  well how do how do we how do we overcome this because i kept having to say look i can't
[9999.70 --> 10004.58]  i can't really i can't i can't really talk about anything other than to say look it's not the right fit
[10004.58 --> 10008.82]  and they're like well yeah but why you know how do i make how do i be the right fit somewhere else
[10008.82 --> 10017.30]  and i'm like oh i get it um so the the deal we ultimately reached um and i think this was their
[10017.30 --> 10026.98]  idea actually was they basically said look if i if i if i like sign the whatever dismissal documentation
[10027.62 --> 10038.10]  um then and we wait a little while can we just like jump on discord and can you just maybe not
[10039.14 --> 10045.54]  maybe not tell me you know why i was dismissed or whatever but why don't we why don't we go through
[10045.54 --> 10052.82]  a project uh together and you can just critique it very honestly that way it's not that and i'm like
[10052.82 --> 10058.50]  okay so we set aside a couple of hours and we had a chat on discord a few weeks later after all the
[10058.50 --> 10063.86]  paperwork was done and everything was settled um that's the one exception that i have made
[10063.86 --> 10071.78]  uh to that because i felt that that person really trust me bro was not interested in making it a
[10071.78 --> 10077.06]  legal problem i was gonna say that's still technically a very sketchy i know thing i know
[10077.06 --> 10082.82]  but they really wanted to know and i i respect it i i totally respect it i'm just saying i respect it
[10082.82 --> 10089.06]  too people shouldn't they shouldn't expect that all well no i like oh sorry i misunderstood i meant like i
[10089.06 --> 10095.94]  like i i respect that person for that too for for wanting that feedback for for craving self-improvement
[10095.94 --> 10101.94]  like that's the thing is so many people i've met over the years do not desire self-improvement so
[10101.94 --> 10112.02]  how do you talk to people like that it's really tough okay hey prime colton colton keeps getting
[10112.02 --> 10118.18]  fired and getting severance packages that's how you own so much property that's hilarious no colton's
[10118.18 --> 10126.50]  actually just a really really really um like senior person to you now like the the firing memes are just
[10126.50 --> 10135.86]  memes uh colton's like yeah he's he's he's good yeah love colton hashtag love colton okay i'm trying
[10135.86 --> 10140.98]  to replace my hard drive circuit board and i was trying to figure out which extra bit set would work
[10140.98 --> 10147.86]  for it also do you guys plan on adding an extra bit set holder to go with the screwdriver yes we do
[10147.86 --> 10153.14]  but we're not gonna i actually had that meeting with the creator warehouse team today one of the new
[10153.14 --> 10158.10]  tool makers was like hey we've seen a lot of these altoids mods people just like modifying an altoids
[10158.10 --> 10163.30]  tin to hold the screwdriver they're really cool actually why don't we just like do that for now as
[10163.30 --> 10168.74]  an mvp minimum viable product and then we'll do like the really good one later i'm like you're new here
[10170.18 --> 10176.58]  we're not going to do that we're going to do the awesome one and in the meantime we can by all means
[10176.58 --> 10181.30]  you know boost people talking about putting them in altoids tins or whatever else sure let's shine
[10181.30 --> 10185.70]  some light on that but no we're just going to do it properly okay and the last one i have here
[10185.70 --> 10191.94]  curated is from charles since you're talking about labor any thoughts on the u.s rail strike and whole
[10191.94 --> 10197.46]  mismanagement extravaganza oh that whole thing should be illegal like i've made my i've made my
[10197.46 --> 10201.86]  thoughts on unionization here very clear i would consider it a personal failure and i've had a lot
[10201.86 --> 10209.30]  of people attack me with that but i think they are i i think it's one of those bad faith interpretations
[10209.30 --> 10215.70]  um the way that i mean it is very clear i think it would be a failure on my part because it would
[10215.70 --> 10221.94]  mean that people i feel like me saying it for you would help sure which is why i was going to jump in
[10221.94 --> 10226.66]  by i'm pretty sure it's accurate you can tell me if it's not sure he wants to treat people well enough
[10226.66 --> 10232.18]  that they don't actually feel like they need one if people needed protection from me that's a person
[10232.18 --> 10238.10]  that sucks yeah that means i suck i think unions are incredibly important and i i feel like they're
[10238.10 --> 10246.74]  they're on a rise because there's been a lot of um extremely poor treatment of workers yeah for a
[10246.74 --> 10252.18]  long time now absolutely people are tired of it and when you push people that far they start to form
[10252.18 --> 10256.58]  groups so they can support each other and that's good and you're seeing a lot of good happening like
[10256.58 --> 10261.54]  the starbucks union there's all this information about what they've been up to and the like wars that
[10261.54 --> 10266.98]  they've been fighting as for what happened with the u.s rail strike that should be illegal yeah just
[10266.98 --> 10271.62]  legislating if if they're important enough that you can legislate them back to work then they're
[10271.62 --> 10279.14]  important enough that you can probably pay them properly yeah like that's that's crazy so yeah
[10283.30 --> 10284.90]  yeah yeah cool
[10284.90 --> 10294.82]  okay i think you know there's some incoming if you want to address those otherwise um i'm out oh let me
[10294.82 --> 10303.78]  have a look here um it's not even any potentials oh i see still oh incoming oh still reeling from the
[10303.78 --> 10308.90]  recent near miss what are your thoughts on the tech layoffs recently wild right did you see amazon's laying
[10308.90 --> 10315.70]  off 18 000 people that is an unfathomable and unfathomable number of people to employ i was
[10315.70 --> 10323.14]  going to say in the first place company's worth of people that that is is wild yeah um yeah uh like
[10323.14 --> 10330.58]  we're still hiring but we ain't going to be picking up that kind of slack yeah that's yeah yeah it's
[10330.58 --> 10335.78]  terrifying right now there are quite a few companies that are hiring right now though um agi is a big thing
[10335.78 --> 10342.98]  there's a lot of new agi startups and stuff maybe check it out um yeah i don't know um i know people
[10342.98 --> 10349.38]  are very worried about developer jobs and 18 000 people joining the pool is not going to make it
[10349.38 --> 10354.26]  super easy but something that i think people have to understand is developers were in such insane
[10354.26 --> 10360.66]  demand before this happened it's not like they're not in demand anymore there's still really high
[10360.66 --> 10367.86]  salary jobs that are being offered um i think i think it'll be okay i think it'll be okay uh muppet
[10367.86 --> 10372.58]  puppet i don't fully understand your question i'm sorry so i'm just going to click show and it might show
[10372.58 --> 10379.22]  up there um something about would you use different cables and maybe someone else in chat can see it and
[10379.22 --> 10381.30]  maybe respond to it um
[10381.30 --> 10391.22]  i just finished building the pc my dad and i specked out before he died what is your favorite memory you
[10391.22 --> 10396.42]  have with your parents my parents watch this show that's a lot of pressure that's heavy um want me
[10396.42 --> 10403.30]  to go first sure okay uh i don't know and your turn no no okay i'll try and come up with something
[10403.30 --> 10409.86]  um it's hard to pick a favorite right like that's how do you how do you possibly pick a favorite
[10409.86 --> 10414.90]  memory from the people who who raised you i mean there's so many little moments of like
[10415.94 --> 10420.18]  you know imparting whether it's imparting wisdom or you know supporting you at a really
[10420.18 --> 10422.26]  you know awful time or whatever else like
[10422.26 --> 10438.82]  yeah holy smokes what are you even yeah okay no i got nothing i'm sorry i think i feel like these
[10438.82 --> 10444.02]  would change depending on the day or hour that you asked me i think my dad's is pretty cemented
[10444.82 --> 10451.70]  when he gave you the talk my mom's my mom gave me the talk not my dad um well okay when he tried
[10452.26 --> 10459.38]  uh my dad it's it's the same kind of thing but there's there's two moments um
[10460.98 --> 10466.74]  we weren't like the wealthiest growing up so one of my buddies and i would often scrounge together some
[10466.74 --> 10471.06]  dollars that him and i would make by doing random odd jobs around to rent video games we didn't own
[10471.06 --> 10476.66]  like a big i i would go over friends houses and they'd have like a shelf of games for their n64 or
[10476.66 --> 10481.94]  whatever i'd be like that's crazy like we have probably not the n64 right now how would you even
[10481.94 --> 10488.42]  play all those games that too like yeah but you definitely know that you could um so we would rent
[10488.42 --> 10496.02]  games with the little money that we got right and man i don't want to like dox myself and where my
[10496.02 --> 10501.86]  parents live so i can't exactly describe this but the walk when you don't have a car yet to the game
[10501.86 --> 10505.70]  rental store because your buddy doesn't have a bike because he was dropped off there by his parents
[10505.70 --> 10513.38]  car so you only have one bike so you walk uh back then it was really long uh one time the store that
[10513.38 --> 10518.90]  we wanted to get the game from because the clothes store didn't have it was i think an hour and a half
[10518.90 --> 10526.34]  long one direction so it took us three hours to get this game which was epic um but one of the games
[10526.34 --> 10532.42]  that we rented was morrowind oh that was a bit of a game changer for you pretty big deal i had never done
[10532.42 --> 10538.34]  this before but the morning after i ran up and like woke my dad up early which was probably not
[10538.34 --> 10544.74]  the strat for the question that i was going to give him um but i enthusiastically described the game
[10545.38 --> 10552.98]  and was like it's amazing i really want to get it and for some reason again we were like super broke
[10552.98 --> 10559.38]  and this is not something that we like did often but he was like okay i'm getting up and i was like what
[10559.38 --> 10564.26]  and then like ran out and he got up got dressed we went and bought morrowind and i was like what the
[10564.26 --> 10570.82]  heck and then not so much the friend that i played it with and i but my dad and i ended up playing a
[10570.82 --> 10576.02]  ludicrous amount of that game together and that was like really cool i think it all comes down to time
[10576.02 --> 10581.94]  spent together like if i was gonna pick some memories like you know it might be uh the cross-country trip
[10581.94 --> 10591.38]  with my mom we i got my license and literally from the canadian equivalent of the dmv i got in the car
[10592.10 --> 10598.74]  and i went for the passenger seat and she's like excuse me i don't drive anymore and i was like this is
[10598.74 --> 10606.50]  a standard automobile and she's like then i guess you better figure out how to drive stick
[10606.50 --> 10613.38]  and i stalled several times in the parking lot and then i drove drove to halifax and back um which
[10613.38 --> 10618.34]  which was pretty cool right yeah there were some there was some tension on the trip my mother who
[10618.34 --> 10625.14]  doesn't watch this show is not always the easiest to get along with and neither am i i am just like her
[10628.02 --> 10632.90]  which is which has been an uncomfortable realization as i've made my way into adulthood
[10632.90 --> 10639.30]  um it's especially hard to hear from yvonne who has a fraught relationship or has had a fraught
[10639.30 --> 10645.30]  relationship with my mother over the years at times uh anywho uh and then like you know with my dad
[10645.30 --> 10650.98]  it's it's maybe like simpler things i don't know if we ever did anything like that big uh but it's like
[10650.98 --> 10658.34]  little things like uh like my dad has has this enthusiasm that is just infectious he's he's definitely
[10658.34 --> 10663.94]  where i get my charisma from no offense mother um what what i have what of it i have and i i'm a
[10663.94 --> 10670.74]  watered down version of both of them in a lot of ways i i don't have his zest for life um and so the
[10670.74 --> 10677.06]  kinds of things i remember with him are uh and you'll probably appreciate this because he was all about
[10677.06 --> 10683.30]  just like doing things hard so i remember going to disneyland um and it's one of my earliest memories i
[10683.30 --> 10690.10]  was like four i remember going to disneyland and it was sprinkling rain that day and he basically
[10691.38 --> 10698.02]  like like like ran around the park like cheerleading me to like run onto all the rides because it was
[10698.02 --> 10703.86]  unbelievable like in california you know you get like three drops of rain and everybody runs inside
[10703.86 --> 10710.26]  right and we're from vancouver we it's literally the nickname weather the nickname is wet coast okay
[10710.26 --> 10715.46]  like what what do we care about some rain uh and you know those are the things that stand out to
[10715.46 --> 10720.66]  you even all these decades later and like halloween halloween with my dad was an experience if you
[10720.66 --> 10729.14]  think kids like halloween you have not met my father because he would he would drag me from door to door
[10729.14 --> 10736.02]  like let's go what are you walking for do you want candy or not yeah there's candy and it's not because he
[10736.02 --> 10740.10]  was he he wasn't even one of those parents that like would eat all the candy he was just like
[10740.98 --> 10746.90]  rude you've got three hours yeah well how much candy are you gonna get and he would and when we'd
[10746.90 --> 10752.18]  get home he would put it on the scale for me and he would like he would like hype me up that yeah we got
[10752.18 --> 10760.98]  like we got like six pounds this year you know and we would like we went man um and like and again he
[10760.98 --> 10768.50]  would run you know he'd run with me and do things like that so it's i i think time spent is um yeah
[10768.50 --> 10774.74]  like i something that i something that i got from my dad is just the ridiculous drive that he has when
[10774.74 --> 10782.18]  he has something that he deems worthy of the drive he didn't get all of it he's unbelievable 100 he's
[10782.18 --> 10787.30]  unbelievable yeah it's ridiculous there's there's certain points in my life where i actually genuinely
[10787.30 --> 10793.38]  functionally don't understand the like physics of how he did what he did like it it makes no sense
[10793.38 --> 10802.34]  nope like he he would work these back-to-back jobs so he'd have like less than eight hours off
[10802.34 --> 10807.54]  like you should sleep right like he would work and i don't mean this would happen once or twice a week
[10807.54 --> 10813.86]  i mean this was every day so i remember there was i remember at least one time that he came home
[10813.86 --> 10818.74]  and he drove into the the driveway and fell asleep in the car because he turned the car off and it
[10818.74 --> 10823.70]  was just immediately like and then he woke up and it was time to go back to work again so he turned the
[10823.70 --> 10830.74]  car on and left like but he would still somehow we had this thing i don't remember exactly what it was
[10830.74 --> 10839.38]  called i'm sure he remembers the name yeah uh but we would play i i would often like i think this is
[10839.38 --> 10842.98]  probably part of the reason why i'm a night owl but i would like stay up until he would come home
[10842.98 --> 10849.94]  and he'd come home from work at like crazy hours um but he would something that he deemed required
[10850.66 --> 10856.66]  was spending time with my brother and i yeah so he'd come in and be like all right it's time to like
[10856.66 --> 10861.62]  hang out so we'd play games until the sun came up and then we'd go sit on the hood of his car and
[10861.62 --> 10868.10]  watch the sunrise nice and that's like even saying that like all the feels all the feels because like
[10868.10 --> 10873.70]  yeah back then i was just like this is cool and now that i'm older i'm like that dude gave up sleep
[10874.50 --> 10879.78]  after working very physical nutrition nutrition everything he gave up everything to be able to
[10879.78 --> 10886.02]  somehow spend more time with us and then he would have to go to work yeah after just not sleeping like
[10886.02 --> 10891.62]  crazy you can have hockey skates or whatever else yeah and and he was the coach in like yeah every sport
[10891.62 --> 10896.90]  that we freaking played and was like better than the other coaches that were there despite having no sleep
[10896.90 --> 10901.22]  and working all these jobs and doing all this kind of stuff and then i i have tons of memories of
[10901.22 --> 10905.70]  hanging out with my dad despite all that stuff which is crazy and then you mentioned the time
[10905.70 --> 10909.38]  thing it's the same kind of deal with my mom i have tons of different memories of us going and doing
[10909.38 --> 10916.98]  things and she's interested in everything you could imagine oh yeah she's had like every job i i cannot
[10916.98 --> 10922.10]  list all the jobs that she's had because i forget so many probably the only the only way to to
[10922.10 --> 10930.42]  how do i put this the the the only thing that outnumbers the number of different jobs your mom
[10930.42 --> 10934.66]  has done is maybe the number of different hobbies like yeah yeah it's like that's a good way of going
[10934.66 --> 10943.62]  for it so like we would go to like the pne or something and the someone's like like talking to someone
[10943.62 --> 10950.66]  who's super passionate about something is basically always interesting yeah even if it's just like oh my like
[10950.66 --> 10955.14]  something that i don't care about like at all iconography yeah i don't care if someone's
[10955.14 --> 10959.86]  interested enough in that i will listen to it all about absolutely i've watched a bunch of like
[10959.86 --> 10964.90]  youtube videos on some topic i've never even heard of before and genuinely don't care about but the
[10964.90 --> 10969.54]  person talking about it is super passionate about it super good at it like it makes it amazingly
[10969.54 --> 10974.10]  interesting so we'd go to like the pne or we'd go to like something we'd go to some type of event or
[10974.10 --> 10978.50]  some type of place and just her interest in everything makes me super interested in everything
[10978.50 --> 10982.58]  and it's just super enjoyable and then i would try to go to one of those like by myself or with
[10982.58 --> 10987.62]  some friends or something and i'd be like this sucks sucks i wish i was like it's like a weird
[10987.62 --> 10991.78]  thing for a kid to say but i was like i wish i wish my mom was here yeah because like it would be way
[10991.78 --> 11000.02]  more interesting to to do that i remember like yeah i don't know it's just yeah i don't know those
[11000.02 --> 11004.02]  those are my answers i guess all right there's just a couple more and we're gonna get through these and
[11004.02 --> 11008.98]  then we're gonna go home it's late uh ghost the toast says my car recently got totaled sorry to
[11008.98 --> 11013.70]  hear that any evs or hybrids that you'd recommend other than the volt the ford maverick seems slick
[11014.26 --> 11015.94]  man the volt just is awesome
[11018.58 --> 11023.70]  like if i was going back to buy a car with exactly the same goal that i had when i when i bought that
[11023.70 --> 11031.78]  thing which was bang for the buck super practical car i would buy it again in fact i just did
[11031.78 --> 11039.30]  we need a passenger car for just like light duty like running errands the logistics team needs it
[11039.30 --> 11044.26]  and stuff i literally just bought another volt from myself i was just gonna say
[11048.34 --> 11049.54]  cool do it again
[11053.22 --> 11058.50]  cool yeah yeah i'm sorry i and you know what there's probably some other great suggestions i will leave
[11058.50 --> 11066.10]  it to the chat to to to get you guys some good suggestions there um uh joshua l says i'm kind
[11066.10 --> 11072.82]  of deep into doing luke's idea with the chat gpt dnd ripoff thing uh it's kind of great yeah i'm not

[11084.58 --> 11089.62]  luke responded to it okay but you're leaving out a lot of like eight hour interview yeah but we
[11089.62 --> 11093.62]  talked about that a couple weeks ago so they can go they can go look for that that's true yeah yeah
[11094.82 --> 11099.78]  um okay uh arturo says i'm a cloud infrastructure engineer for a big tech company i'm looking for
[11099.78 --> 11104.34]  a place with better work-life balance any chance you guys might be hiring a terraform guy i don't know
[11104.34 --> 11112.42]  what terraform is uh very potentially at some point but not right now okay yeah um
[11112.42 --> 11118.10]  um also working here working here is horrible we don't want more applications right yeah yeah it's
[11118.10 --> 11122.34]  really awful there's too many yeah it's bad i don't know if we can say the person's name yet but

[11147.70 --> 11152.90]  mean it doesn't do everything uh i know hollow point is better if you want to do like more full body
[11152.90 --> 11158.50]  movement um you you gotta like really go to to get the workout but that's true of anything you get out
[11158.50 --> 11164.82]  of it what you put into it i would find something that you find fun and has a solid amount of movement in
[11164.82 --> 11170.90]  it then you're gonna get some good cardio and that's very valuable so um all right this last
[11170.90 --> 11177.54]  one has an obvious answer jose l says hi like luke and linus this is the last one last one on the show
