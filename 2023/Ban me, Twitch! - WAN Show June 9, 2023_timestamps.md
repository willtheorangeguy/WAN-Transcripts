so many employees but gotta wait 7+ hours for timestamps lol and i think some random does it

[2023-06-10T08:22:10Z] Video: Ban me, Twitch! - WAN Show June 9, 2023 
I can't watch a near 4 hour show that doesn't have timestamps - I mean come on !

[2023-06-10T08:01:13Z] Video: Ban me, Twitch! - WAN Show June 9, 2023 
I feel like LTT should provide their own timestamps and not wait for random people to do that. Not everyone can/wants to watch 4 hours.

On the other hand, I understand why they wouldn't want to do that.
