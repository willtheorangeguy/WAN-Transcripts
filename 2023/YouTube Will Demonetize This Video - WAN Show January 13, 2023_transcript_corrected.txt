[0.00 → 18.92] Oh hey, sup, it's WAN Show.
[19.32 → 21.68] Going to get some bitches, get some pussy.
[22.58 → 23.58] Sup, Silent Luke.
[25.58 → 28.54] In all seriousness, though, we've got a lot of great topics for you guys,
[28.54 → 30.40] and it's going to be a bit of an unusual show.
[31.34 → 38.20] YouTube's updated swearing and violence policies have caused mass demonetization of gaming YouTubers' videos.
[41.38 → 46.34] Wizards of the Coast has backpedalled on OIL changes after community backlash.
[46.90 → 48.58] Peso moves ahead without them.
[49.64 → 53.82] Ooh, there's been some interesting developments around the 7900 XTX
[53.82 → 57.90] and the problems it's been facing, courtesy of our friend Roman Debater,
[57.90 → 62.42] and Luke had oral surgery, so he can't really talk.
[63.08 → 64.42] Hence the get-ups.
[64.74 → 67.32] Let's go ahead and roll that intro.
[71.46 → 73.10] Oh no, I'm the one who does that.
[73.10 → 93.24] Shit, man.
[93.50 → 96.12] Show's brought to you by Notion, FreshBooks, Squarespace.
[96.84 → 97.28] Shit.
[97.28 → 101.16] All right.
[101.58 → 106.54] So, why don't we jump right into our main topic for the day.
[107.06 → 111.04] Prominent gaming creators have stoked community backlash against YouTube
[111.04 → 115.50] over recent changes to its ad-friendly content guidelines,
[115.96 → 122.62] which has caused many of said creators' videos to be age-restricted and or demonetized.
[122.62 → 130.54] Hence the title of the video, and, I mean, I guess live benchmark of YouTube's content filtering,
[130.66 → 135.90] because I went out of my way to attempt to break their new filters,
[136.08 → 140.20] or rather break the rules, within the first eight seconds of the video.
[140.62 → 145.24] The live stream went live almost instantly on YouTube, which I'm not used to.
[145.32 → 148.18] Normally there's about a five to fifteen-second delay.
[148.18 → 152.44] I might have missed the window, but I took my best shot at it.
[153.08 → 159.04] Now, starting in October 2020, the guidelines stated that frequent use of strong profanity
[159.04 → 161.72] could result in limited or no ads.
[161.92 → 167.24] But in April 2021, the guidelines changed to allow creators to use moderate profanity,
[167.56 → 171.36] like shit and bitch, within the first 30 seconds of a video.
[171.36 → 177.64] In November 2022, YouTube issued a major update, though, to these guidelines.
[178.14 → 181.18] Not only could profanity be used within the first seven seconds,
[181.72 → 185.74] oh, not only could profanity used within the first seven seconds lead to limited ads,
[185.94 → 191.00] but all profanity was now treated equally, except for hell and damn,
[191.28 → 195.20] which apparently are no longer being treated as profanity anymore.
[195.20 → 197.56] What the hell? Like damn!
[199.64 → 201.50] Damn's not even a swear word anymore!
[203.54 → 204.70] We're all going to hell.
[205.52 → 208.60] Profanity used after the first eight seconds, though,
[208.66 → 211.34] was apparently fine as long as it was not excessive.
[212.04 → 215.50] The update also specifies that standard gameplay,
[215.74 → 219.06] where gory injuries are present within the first eight seconds,
[219.40 → 220.94] would lead to limited ads.
[220.94 → 227.20] On December 25th, Daniel Concern of RT Game asked YouTube for help
[227.20 → 229.96] after one of his videos was set to limited ads.
[230.44 → 232.96] And in addition to denying his appeal,
[233.32 → 237.56] YouTube subsequently flagged over a dozen more of his past videos.
[238.18 → 241.46] Concern believes that they were flagged because he escalated the issue.
[242.50 → 242.82] Hmm.
[243.08 → 245.02] Uh, oh, you know what?
[245.08 → 248.26] It looks like Riley and I are kind of the same mind here.
[248.26 → 250.02] Riley says, yeah, it does look like that,
[250.02 → 252.54] but as all-powerful as the algorithm is,
[252.82 → 256.04] it is actually not scanning every YouTube video all the time.
[256.20 → 258.70] So when attention is brought to offending content,
[259.24 → 262.24] it, humans or more likely bots,
[262.64 → 265.34] probably checks related content.
[266.64 → 269.54] Proud has apparently tested the policy already,
[269.62 → 271.66] waiting 18 seconds before swearing,
[271.86 → 274.32] and the video still got demonetized.
[274.32 → 276.60] Hey, um, uh, Dan,
[276.78 → 278.82] can we just throw up our sponsors down here
[278.82 → 282.24] to just thank them for being part of making sure
[282.24 → 284.74] that we can run this demonetization experiment?
[285.34 → 287.90] Do you want to just throw them up on the bottom for me?
[287.94 → 288.82] Just one after the other?
[288.88 → 289.56] Hey, look at that.
[289.60 → 290.62] We got Notion today.
[290.84 → 292.10] We got FreshBooks.
[292.34 → 293.62] We got Squarespace.
[294.26 → 296.78] Those are some damn good sponsors.
[296.78 → 298.40] Hell yeah.
[301.40 → 305.44] This morning, YouTube gave a statement to The Verge,
[305.46 → 306.88] and we've actually got the statement up here,
[306.96 → 309.08] which I have not had the pleasure of reading yet
[309.08 → 311.88] because I was busy getting dressed up for the show.
[312.58 → 313.84] In recent weeks,
[313.84 → 316.46] we've heard from many creators regarding this update.
[316.80 → 318.66] YouTube spokesperson Michael Baseman?
[319.78 → 320.00] Oh.
[320.86 → 321.64] So he's an Baseman.
[321.64 → 324.24] I thought maybe more of a
[324.24 → 325.64] more of a bookman, but...
[326.78 → 327.52] An Baseman.
[327.70 → 328.10] Okay, good.
[328.46 → 329.22] Uh, told The Verge.
[329.70 → 331.20] That feedback is important to us,
[331.26 → 333.12] and we are in the process of making some adjustments
[333.12 → 334.76] to this policy to address their concerns.
[334.96 → 337.76] We will follow up shortly with our creator community
[337.76 → 340.56] as soon as we have more to share.
[340.98 → 343.24] Well, that's not really a statement, is it?
[344.50 → 345.64] No, it's not.
[345.78 → 346.40] He agrees.
[346.56 → 347.32] Thank you for that.
[348.90 → 349.34] Um,
[349.34 → 352.50] we've got a few discussion questions here.
[352.88 → 353.40] First,
[353.70 → 355.32] what responsibility does YouTube have
[355.32 → 357.90] to inform creators of changes to its guidelines,
[358.02 → 359.10] both current or upcoming?
[359.56 → 361.30] I think, honestly speaking,
[361.66 → 364.06] that's the biggest problem here,
[364.12 → 365.20] from my point of view.
[365.36 → 368.14] It's not that the rules exist, right?
[368.48 → 371.20] Like, it's been pretty common sense for us
[371.20 → 372.22] for a long time,
[372.56 → 374.22] that you have to understand,
[374.78 → 378.24] ad-safe guidelines don't come from YouTube.
[378.24 → 381.66] They come from advertiser tolerance
[381.66 → 383.70] towards a particular thing.
[383.70 → 385.70] So we all have our own internal,
[386.70 → 386.90] you know,
[387.10 → 389.90] moral and taboo compasses, right?
[390.28 → 391.44] Like, for some people,
[391.84 → 392.16] uh,
[392.16 → 393.42] full-frontal nudity is like,
[393.56 → 393.90] whatever.
[394.06 → 394.26] Like,
[394.40 → 395.14] my understanding,
[395.34 → 396.38] as a North American,
[396.74 → 397.36] where that's like,
[397.62 → 399.84] is that in Europe,
[400.10 → 400.72] you can like,
[400.98 → 402.72] have a billboard on the side of the
[402.72 → 405.58] fucking road,
[405.84 → 406.06] okay?
[406.68 → 407.28] Okay, look,
[407.34 → 408.32] we're benchmarking the thing,
[408.36 → 408.60] okay?
[408.94 → 410.70] You can have a billboard on the road
[410.70 → 411.54] with like,
[412.00 → 413.22] full-frontal nudity on it,
[413.26 → 413.62] and it's like,
[413.68 → 414.14] yeah, what?
[414.42 → 414.62] You know,
[414.64 → 415.60] like Holland or whatever.
[416.22 → 416.88] Over here?
[417.80 → 418.30] I mean,
[418.34 → 419.74] you show a little bit of crack,
[420.34 → 421.02] and that's like,
[421.18 → 422.30] like not the kind you smoke,
[422.40 → 424.12] like the kind out the back of your butt
[424.12 → 424.98] or the front of your chest,
[425.04 → 425.22] right?
[425.30 → 425.54] Like,
[426.62 → 426.80] you're,
[426.94 → 427.98] whoa,
[428.08 → 428.70] so edgy,
[428.76 → 428.94] right?
[429.08 → 429.40] I mean,
[429.40 → 431.38] that was more true 20 years ago,
[431.50 → 431.70] but,
[432.54 → 432.94] even,
[433.16 → 433.84] even today,
[434.02 → 434.66] compared to,
[434.78 → 436.20] compared to other regions of the world,
[436.30 → 436.62] it's,
[436.96 → 437.80] it's different,
[437.88 → 438.08] right?
[438.34 → 438.74] So,
[438.86 → 439.92] everyone has kind of like,
[439.92 → 440.50] their own,
[440.56 → 441.38] their own ideas,
[441.72 → 442.66] whether it's nudity,
[442.76 → 443.32] or violence,
[443.50 → 444.26] or profanity,
[444.26 → 446.80] for what can be considered tolerable.
[446.86 → 447.26] By the way,
[447.50 → 448.76] for those of you watching,
[448.90 → 451.76] who do not like a profanity riddled WAN show,
[452.00 → 453.64] we'll be back to normal next week.
[454.26 → 456.50] Feel free to let your kids tune in.
[456.82 → 458.62] We will not have the video marked.
[458.76 → 460.26] We are trying to get demonetized.
[460.34 → 461.78] That's how you'll be able to know the difference.
[463.50 → 463.94] Riley,
[464.18 → 464.58] apparently,
[464.90 → 467.06] is adding notes in real time here.
[467.44 → 467.70] Note,
[468.16 → 469.26] excessive or,
[469.72 → 471.28] excessive profanity can,
[472.30 → 472.96] okay,
[473.22 → 473.46] this is,
[473.56 → 474.10] he's taking,
[474.26 → 476.22] he's not a good at typing board,
[476.34 → 477.22] keyboard guy.
[478.74 → 481.02] Excessive profanity can lead to demonetization,
[481.28 → 481.58] so,
[481.78 → 482.48] don't overdo it,
[482.52 → 482.74] I think,
[482.80 → 483.16] is what he's,
[483.22 → 484.10] is what he's trying to say.
[484.54 → 484.88] Anyway,
[484.96 → 487.28] my issue is not that YouTube has rules.
[487.42 → 488.52] Rules exist for a reason,
[488.64 → 489.70] and it's because brands,
[490.06 → 492.04] simply don't like their brand,
[492.20 → 493.72] next to content that they feel,
[493.82 → 494.96] could reflect poorly on them.
[495.40 → 496.38] Whether that is,
[497.32 → 498.52] whether that's rational,
[498.82 → 498.96] like,
[499.02 → 500.08] whether that has any,
[500.14 → 500.42] any,
[500.70 → 502.50] any data backing to it,
[502.50 → 502.90] or not,
[502.90 → 506.04] sometimes people make emotional purchases,
[506.64 → 508.42] be it a gorgeous,
[508.76 → 510.22] tech-themed water bottle,
[510.42 → 512.38] or be it a marketing campaign,
[512.66 → 512.96] okay,
[513.18 → 516.12] and if they see something that they don't like,
[516.18 → 518.04] they could experience buyer's remorse,
[518.08 → 520.00] and not work with that platform again,
[520.00 → 520.68] so I get it.
[520.68 → 523.10] The issue from my point of view,
[523.34 → 524.82] and I think Luke agrees,
[525.16 → 528.06] is that this is just happening.
[528.58 → 529.18] It's just,
[529.26 → 530.92] it's just happening in the night,
[531.28 → 533.34] and people aren't being informed,
[533.68 → 534.82] and clearly,
[535.30 → 536.80] it wasn't common sense
[536.80 → 538.22] to some of the people
[538.22 → 539.58] who use a lot of profanity
[539.58 → 540.68] and expect advertisements
[540.68 → 542.38] to show up on their videos just fine,
[542.38 → 544.58] and not only was it,
[544.80 → 545.02] you know,
[545.06 → 546.28] not common sense or whatever,
[546.28 → 548.54] but the community has ultimately figured out
[548.54 → 549.54] where the line was,
[549.96 → 551.56] people were figuring out
[551.56 → 552.90] how to stay within it,
[553.02 → 554.30] and then the line moved.
[556.32 → 559.10] That is not okay.
[559.48 → 559.94] I mean,
[560.26 → 560.50] yeah,
[560.58 → 562.00] I think this is Luke's cursor now,
[562.00 → 563.28] because it typed a lot faster.
[565.38 → 565.60] You know,
[565.64 → 566.12] Luke says,
[566.24 → 566.74] it's kind of,
[566.98 → 567.50] Luke figures,
[567.60 → 567.76] you know,
[567.78 → 568.50] it's like when Elon
[568.50 → 569.96] randomly started banning
[569.96 → 572.48] everyone that was doxing people on Twitter,
[572.58 → 574.06] when what really happened was
[574.06 → 576.46] he changed the definition of doxing.
[576.80 → 578.50] So if YouTube is banning people,
[578.66 → 579.26] or not banning,
[579.32 → 580.54] but demonetizing people
[580.54 → 583.24] for using too much profanity,
[583.62 → 586.00] when even just the words too much
[586.00 → 587.52] or excessive
[587.52 → 590.06] are fucking meaningless,
[591.08 → 591.36] right?
[591.36 → 594.56] How are people supposed to deal with that?
[594.60 → 596.40] And you have to understand, right?
[596.46 → 599.64] YouTube is not some rinky-dink little platform
[599.64 → 600.56] that, you know,
[600.62 → 602.22] people upload to for fun anymore.
[602.48 → 604.12] This is people's livelihoods
[604.12 → 604.76] that are at stake,
[604.78 → 606.26] unless they have really great sponsors,
[606.48 → 606.74] like,
[607.48 → 608.70] can you get those sponsors
[608.70 → 609.88] across the bottom for me again?
[609.96 → 611.82] Just want to shout out our sponsors
[611.82 → 612.96] who hopefully,
[613.10 → 613.96] hey, thanks Notion,
[614.42 → 617.44] are comfortable being next to this kind of,
[617.54 → 618.32] thanks FreshBooks,
[619.84 → 620.80] unsavoury,
[620.80 → 621.78] unsavoury,
[621.90 → 622.12] you know,
[622.18 → 622.70] language,
[622.84 → 623.06] right?
[623.74 → 624.14] Squarespace,
[624.38 → 625.04] Squarespace 2,
[625.16 → 625.90] shout out Squarespace.
[625.90 → 626.10] Squarespace,
[626.46 → 628.32] if they haven't ditched me yet,
[628.38 → 629.58] they're not going to ditch me now.
[631.58 → 632.10] Now,
[632.26 → 634.22] our second discussion question here is,
[634.50 → 636.56] what responsibility do creators have
[636.56 → 638.58] to be aware of potential changes like this
[638.58 → 639.38] and play it?
[639.44 → 639.64] Safe,
[639.72 → 639.98] cough,
[640.08 → 640.36] cough,
[640.50 → 641.22] LEG.
[641.22 → 643.20] And that's true.
[644.22 → 644.68] I mean,
[644.76 → 645.32] you know,
[645.90 → 649.12] Luke has not been in favour at times
[649.12 → 652.20] of our family-friendly approach to,
[652.74 → 653.16] I mean,
[653.20 → 654.34] really a lot of things.
[654.74 → 654.96] Like,
[654.96 → 656.44] we get edgy sometimes.
[656.94 → 658.14] I think that the
[658.14 → 660.24] How to Hide Your Pornography video
[660.24 → 662.22] was among the edgiest things
[662.22 → 663.34] that we've ever done.
[664.96 → 667.28] But we mostly get edgy
[667.28 → 669.80] in like kind of a silly toilet humour,
[670.06 → 671.50] innuendo kind of way.
[671.50 → 673.48] We don't go straight for,
[673.70 → 674.30] you know,
[674.34 → 674.82] really,
[675.00 → 676.30] really vulgar language
[676.30 → 676.80] or,
[677.10 → 677.48] you know,
[677.54 → 678.66] really graphic,
[679.10 → 680.62] really graphic language
[680.62 → 681.78] or imagery.
[682.34 → 683.82] And a big part of that
[683.82 → 684.68] has been
[684.68 → 685.70] out of staying
[685.70 → 686.66] advertiser friendly.
[686.78 → 688.00] It was a business decision.
[688.12 → 688.96] It was not because
[688.96 → 690.96] I have any particular aversion
[690.96 → 692.12] to using cuss words.
[693.72 → 695.30] As for what responsibility
[695.30 → 696.22] creators have,
[696.28 → 696.38] like,
[696.44 → 697.06] that's tough,
[697.12 → 697.24] right?
[697.30 → 697.66] Because
[697.66 → 700.34] creators are supposed
[700.34 → 701.36] to be diverse.
[702.16 → 702.34] Right?
[702.82 → 704.56] That's one of the benefits
[704.56 → 706.32] of the platform.
[706.86 → 708.02] And there's a certain,
[708.22 → 709.32] I don't think
[709.32 → 711.16] that for our type of content
[711.16 → 712.82] and for our message,
[713.14 → 714.46] there's any particular need
[714.46 → 714.92] to swear.
[715.54 → 716.82] And personally,
[717.02 → 717.78] I consider
[717.78 → 719.54] a bleeped fuck
[719.54 → 720.46] to be funnier
[720.46 → 721.94] than a not bleeped fuck.
[722.46 → 723.24] I think that,
[723.62 → 724.34] I just,
[724.48 → 725.40] I find it to be
[725.40 → 726.40] comedically
[726.40 → 729.12] superior.
[729.44 → 729.66] Okay?
[729.92 → 730.58] So that's
[730.58 → 731.70] a huge part
[731.70 → 732.06] of the reason
[732.06 → 732.84] that we do things
[732.84 → 733.82] the way that we do.
[734.30 → 735.20] But also,
[735.52 → 736.50] because we want
[736.50 → 737.04] to remain
[737.04 → 738.18] advertiser friendly.
[739.34 → 739.82] However,
[740.12 → 741.52] I think that there
[741.52 → 742.44] are creators
[742.44 → 743.72] whose personalities
[743.72 → 745.56] or whose message
[745.56 → 747.56] could be aided
[747.56 → 749.18] by speaking in a way
[749.18 → 749.72] that is true
[749.72 → 750.28] to themselves
[750.28 → 751.52] and that might
[751.52 → 752.60] involve some cussing.
[753.08 → 753.52] And so,
[753.66 → 754.80] for me to say,
[754.96 → 755.82] or for me to pass
[755.82 → 756.80] some kind of judgment,
[756.90 → 757.12] right,
[757.12 → 758.66] on the responsibility
[758.66 → 759.64] that creators
[759.64 → 760.88] have to be aware
[760.88 → 762.20] of potential changes
[762.20 → 763.02] and play it safe,
[763.36 → 764.80] I think it's one
[764.80 → 765.26] of those things
[765.26 → 768.52] where my opinion's
[768.52 → 768.84] irrelevant
[768.84 → 770.36] and so is his.
[771.50 → 771.96] Right?
[772.04 → 772.18] Like,
[772.26 → 773.36] we're coming at this
[773.36 → 773.98] from a space,
[774.12 → 775.10] from a personality
[775.10 → 776.12] that doesn't need
[776.12 → 776.78] to communicate
[776.78 → 777.58] in that way.
[778.00 → 778.26] Whereas,
[779.74 → 780.84] some people do.
[781.26 → 782.14] And I just,
[782.36 → 783.20] I want YouTube
[783.20 → 784.04] to be a place
[784.04 → 785.12] where all kinds
[785.12 → 785.68] of creation
[785.68 → 786.46] can thrive.
[786.50 → 786.80] That is,
[786.84 → 787.62] as long as you're not
[787.62 → 789.00] spreading disinformation,
[789.52 → 790.26] spreading hate,
[790.60 → 790.84] you know,
[790.98 → 793.02] engaging in illegal activities.
[793.02 → 793.88] If you're recruiting
[793.88 → 795.38] for ISIS or some shit,
[795.44 → 796.56] then as far as I'm concerned,
[796.88 → 797.74] you can get the fuck
[797.74 → 798.52] off the platform.
[798.86 → 799.26] Right?
[799.44 → 799.66] But,
[801.96 → 802.72] man,
[802.82 → 804.22] a couple F-bombs,
[805.64 → 806.42] I don't know,
[806.42 → 806.86] it's tough.
[806.94 → 807.58] I think that,
[807.68 → 809.40] I think that if advertisers
[809.40 → 810.48] haven't already
[810.48 → 812.32] gotten used to the fact
[812.32 → 813.54] that YouTube is like
[813.54 → 815.30] kind of zoo,
[816.10 → 816.76] there's a little bit
[816.76 → 817.32] of everything,
[817.88 → 818.16] you know?
[818.92 → 820.08] Sometimes it's the kind
[820.08 → 820.70] of zoo where,
[820.82 → 821.08] you know,
[821.62 → 822.58] they had more than two
[822.58 → 823.42] of that kind of animal,
[823.50 → 824.08] you know what I'm saying?
[824.64 → 824.86] You know,
[824.90 → 826.44] they got a lot going on.
[828.14 → 828.96] It's a cluster,
[829.18 → 829.44] okay?
[829.98 → 830.50] That's what I'm trying
[830.50 → 830.86] to say.
[834.06 → 835.40] Our next discussion
[835.40 → 836.32] question that Luke
[836.32 → 837.18] and I will be discussing
[837.18 → 838.86] is what would need
[838.86 → 839.76] to happen to enable
[839.76 → 841.48] a YouTube-level platform
[841.48 → 842.38] that doesn't rely
[842.38 → 843.40] on potentially prudish
[843.40 → 844.44] advertisers for revenue.
[844.74 → 844.98] Haha,
[845.10 → 845.24] wait,
[845.32 → 845.80] that's Float plane.
[846.02 → 846.86] Except it isn't,
[846.92 → 847.10] right?
[847.42 → 848.64] Because we know,
[848.84 → 850.06] we know it's not
[850.06 → 851.06] a sustainable model,
[851.20 → 851.36] right?
[851.42 → 851.60] Like,
[851.72 → 852.38] once you've got
[852.38 → 853.14] a certain amount
[853.14 → 853.70] of momentum,
[854.46 → 854.70] like,
[855.40 → 855.96] LEG,
[856.54 → 857.16] which I shouldn't
[857.16 → 857.76] call it that,
[857.96 → 858.78] Linus Media Group
[858.78 → 860.66] has over 30,000
[860.66 → 861.48] paying subscribers
[861.48 → 862.20] on Float plane
[862.20 → 862.74] that are anywhere
[862.74 → 864.16] between we have,
[864.22 → 864.38] like,
[864.52 → 865.98] OG grandfathered-in
[865.98 → 867.30] members at a $3,
[867.78 → 869.32] $3 a month tier.
[869.72 → 870.98] That is no longer
[870.98 → 871.24] available,
[871.36 → 872.28] hasn't been for years.
[872.38 → 872.64] In fact,
[872.70 → 874.00] I think the percentage
[874.00 → 875.60] of $3 tier users
[875.60 → 877.30] is really dwindling
[877.30 → 877.94] these days.
[878.38 → 879.84] We have a $5 tier,
[879.92 → 880.30] and then we have
[880.30 → 881.06] a $10 tier
[881.06 → 881.96] that gets you 4K,
[882.08 → 883.10] which is higher bitrate
[883.10 → 884.06] than YouTube's 4K.
[884.42 → 885.96] And most importantly,
[886.12 → 887.64] not necessarily image quality,
[887.64 → 888.78] but our audio
[888.78 → 890.24] is uncompressed,
[890.34 → 890.82] which is one of the
[890.82 → 891.40] big reasons
[891.40 → 892.48] that someone like
[892.48 → 893.84] Dank pods is on
[893.84 → 894.26] Float plane
[894.26 → 894.96] for his garbage
[894.96 → 895.66] time streams.
[897.02 → 898.32] It's super cool
[898.32 → 900.24] because he drums,
[900.66 → 900.86] right?
[901.20 → 902.04] And YouTube's
[902.04 → 902.76] audio compression,
[902.96 → 903.86] Twitch for that matter,
[904.26 → 905.08] makes it so that,
[905.12 → 905.42] like,
[906.44 → 907.44] it doesn't have
[907.44 → 908.30] the dynamism
[908.30 → 909.50] that Float plane
[909.50 → 910.62] streaming can get him,
[910.64 → 910.82] right?
[911.18 → 911.96] And so,
[912.26 → 912.94] it's great
[912.94 → 914.40] for people like us
[914.40 → 915.42] who have that
[915.42 → 916.94] kind of critical mass
[916.94 → 917.66] that,
[918.24 → 918.54] I mean,
[918.60 → 919.64] you guys do the math,
[919.76 → 919.92] right?
[920.04 → 921.28] 30,000 people
[921.28 → 922.22] paying anywhere
[922.22 → 923.26] from realistically
[923.26 → 924.86] $5 to $10 a month
[924.86 → 926.14] is not an insignificant
[926.14 → 927.12] amount of revenue.
[927.32 → 929.16] It justifies a development team.
[929.48 → 930.90] It justifies us
[930.90 → 932.18] investing in
[932.18 → 933.56] a group of people
[933.56 → 935.14] that makes exclusive content
[935.14 → 936.30] just for that platform,
[936.82 → 937.08] right?
[937.16 → 938.20] Or for someone like,
[938.20 → 939.40] for someone like Dank pods,
[939.48 → 939.68] right?
[940.02 → 940.82] Where he's got
[940.82 → 942.46] a specific use case for it
[942.46 → 944.28] and a dedicated audience
[944.28 → 945.26] that is really into
[945.26 → 946.26] that kind of content
[946.26 → 947.56] that will pay for it
[947.56 → 947.88] monthly.
[948.10 → 949.32] But I've had a lot of people
[949.32 → 949.90] point out,
[950.02 → 950.16] like,
[950.50 → 951.14] hey Linus,
[951.38 → 952.46] I couldn't help noticing
[952.46 → 953.96] I have to pay for every creator.
[954.14 → 955.54] That adds up too fast.
[955.60 → 956.38] I can't afford it.
[957.04 → 957.96] I get it.
[958.42 → 958.94] 100%.
[958.94 → 961.52] You are right.
[962.18 → 963.52] A platform like Vessel
[963.52 → 964.48] where you can pay
[964.48 → 965.64] one time
[965.64 → 966.34] and get
[966.34 → 967.40] all you can get access
[967.40 → 968.18] to every creator
[968.18 → 968.88] on the platform,
[969.04 → 970.50] that's way better.
[970.50 → 971.70] But
[971.70 → 973.90] you aren't YouTube,
[974.20 → 974.48] right?
[974.80 → 975.60] So let's say
[975.60 → 977.32] you have 100,000 users
[977.32 → 978.34] or something like that,
[978.38 → 978.56] okay?
[978.70 → 980.08] Even a pretty good number
[980.08 → 980.48] of users.
[980.54 → 981.78] You got 100,000 users,
[982.24 → 982.50] okay?
[982.62 → 983.96] They're paying $5 a month.
[984.02 → 985.96] That's $500,000 a month.
[986.12 → 986.98] That's a ton of money.
[987.52 → 989.24] For an all-you-can-eat platform,
[989.44 → 989.60] okay,
[989.66 → 990.12] wait a second,
[990.20 → 990.48] hold on.
[990.52 → 991.28] How many creators
[991.28 → 992.18] do I have on here?
[992.38 → 993.58] If I've even got
[993.58 → 995.66] 50 creators,
[995.80 → 996.02] right?
[996.30 → 997.12] All of a sudden,
[997.22 → 997.98] now we're talking
[997.98 → 999.44] 500,000.
[1000.32 → 1000.92] Oh, boy.
[1002.58 → 1003.46] Divide by five.
[1004.10 → 1004.32] Okay,
[1004.36 → 1005.18] that's 20 grand a month.
[1005.28 → 1006.28] That's a ton of money.
[1008.04 → 1008.60] Man, yeah.
[1008.68 → 1009.28] How can we get
[1009.28 → 1010.84] 100,000 subscribers
[1010.84 → 1011.50] on Float plane?
[1011.70 → 1011.86] Man,
[1011.98 → 1012.68] okay, anyway.
[1013.62 → 1014.62] The point is,
[1014.68 → 1015.06] you would have
[1015.06 → 1016.26] more than 50 creators.
[1016.60 → 1018.34] If we built a platform
[1018.34 → 1019.28] that was like
[1019.28 → 1019.94] an all-you-can-eat,
[1020.00 → 1020.42] that was like
[1020.42 → 1021.78] a smorgasbord model,
[1022.16 → 1022.96] what would happen
[1022.96 → 1024.10] is the share
[1024.10 → 1025.52] for those individual creators,
[1025.52 → 1026.86] if we had 50
[1026.86 → 1027.62] that were the size
[1027.62 → 1028.24] of LTT,
[1028.46 → 1028.98] for example,
[1029.40 → 1030.70] the share of that revenue
[1030.70 → 1031.84] for each of those creators
[1031.84 → 1032.44] that's left
[1032.44 → 1033.22] by the time you deal
[1033.22 → 1034.42] with payment processing fees,
[1034.50 → 1035.62] which are significant,
[1036.52 → 1037.10] man,
[1037.18 → 1037.92] we haven't talked about
[1037.92 → 1038.62] the exact numbers
[1038.62 → 1039.36] in a long time,
[1039.44 → 1039.86] so you're going to have
[1039.86 → 1040.58] to just kind of
[1040.58 → 1041.46] let me know.
[1041.78 → 1042.96] If I recall correctly,
[1043.00 → 1044.34] it was 15% flat
[1044.34 → 1045.28] per transaction
[1045.28 → 1046.40] plus a percentage,
[1047.06 → 1047.94] give or take.
[1048.02 → 1048.90] Is it 25 flat?
[1048.98 → 1049.30] I don't know.
[1049.36 → 1050.08] The point is,
[1050.70 → 1051.98] it is a significant
[1051.98 → 1052.82] amount of money
[1052.82 → 1053.32] when you're looking
[1053.32 → 1054.92] at a $5 transaction.
[1054.92 → 1056.10] The lower the transaction,
[1056.34 → 1057.54] the bigger the proportion
[1057.54 → 1058.48] it is because you have
[1058.48 → 1059.64] to deal with that flat fee
[1059.64 → 1060.50] no matter what.
[1060.90 → 1061.34] So essentially,
[1061.46 → 1062.42] you're just enriching
[1062.42 → 1063.34] credit card companies,
[1063.44 → 1063.92] which the world
[1063.92 → 1065.22] definitely needs more of,
[1065.34 → 1066.26] obviously.
[1068.90 → 1070.18] So as soon as you start
[1070.18 → 1070.92] to divide it
[1070.92 → 1072.24] between more and more
[1072.24 → 1072.72] and more and more
[1072.72 → 1073.44] and more creators,
[1073.76 → 1075.06] they lose their incentive
[1075.06 → 1076.90] to actually even bother
[1076.90 → 1078.14] to upload on the platform
[1078.14 → 1078.68] because,
[1079.06 → 1079.62] you know what,
[1079.72 → 1080.70] I'm going to get my like,
[1080.70 → 1082.20] I'm MKBHD,
[1082.72 → 1082.88] right?
[1082.96 → 1083.12] What,
[1083.16 → 1084.18] I'm going to get my $60
[1084.18 → 1085.16] check in the mail
[1085.16 → 1086.64] or even my $600
[1086.64 → 1087.68] check in the mail.
[1088.08 → 1088.32] You know,
[1088.40 → 1088.96] I don't want to,
[1089.74 → 1090.04] you know,
[1090.12 → 1090.84] obviously,
[1091.00 → 1091.88] I don't know exactly
[1091.88 → 1092.88] what his numbers are,
[1093.26 → 1094.88] but I work in the same vertical.
[1095.12 → 1096.02] I have some idea.
[1096.30 → 1097.28] I can tell you that
[1097.28 → 1099.06] a $600 check to Marquez
[1099.06 → 1099.86] is pretty much
[1099.86 → 1100.58] a rounding error,
[1101.02 → 1101.26] right?
[1101.68 → 1103.08] And with his costs,
[1103.60 → 1104.70] you guys got to understand,
[1104.88 → 1105.64] I'm not saying that
[1105.64 → 1106.26] because he's like
[1106.26 → 1107.06] so out of touch
[1107.06 → 1108.10] and just has so much money.
[1108.40 → 1109.08] I'm just saying
[1109.08 → 1109.60] that he's running
[1109.60 → 1110.48] a business over there.
[1110.56 → 1112.10] He's got a dozen plus employees,
[1112.44 → 1113.64] nice space,
[1113.88 → 1114.50] good equipment.
[1114.80 → 1115.68] He's trying to do
[1115.68 → 1116.32] a great job
[1116.32 → 1116.90] of what he's doing.
[1117.00 → 1117.14] Okay,
[1117.18 → 1118.44] it costs money to do that
[1118.44 → 1120.34] and that amount of money
[1120.34 → 1123.14] ain't going to make
[1123.14 → 1123.96] a huge difference.
[1125.70 → 1126.06] So,
[1127.52 → 1127.76] oh,
[1127.84 → 1128.04] okay,
[1128.16 → 1128.28] hey,
[1128.38 → 1129.42] AJ is posted
[1129.42 → 1130.18] in the float plane chat.
[1130.24 → 1131.48] I was apparently way off.
[1131.62 → 1132.26] It is actually
[1132.26 → 1134.40] $0.30 per transaction
[1134.40 → 1135.38] plus a percentage.
[1136.02 → 1136.24] So,
[1136.32 → 1137.90] on those $3 transactions
[1137.90 → 1138.78] in the early days,
[1139.32 → 1140.28] we were giving up
[1140.28 → 1142.62] 10% right off the bat
[1142.62 → 1143.94] to a flat transaction fee.
[1144.26 → 1144.54] Now,
[1144.68 → 1145.48] I haven't been looking
[1145.48 → 1146.28] at the chat lately,
[1146.38 → 1147.32] but I'm sure some people
[1147.32 → 1148.24] are asking about Nebula.
[1148.38 → 1149.66] Nebula has a very,
[1149.74 → 1151.12] very different model
[1151.12 → 1152.46] where essentially
[1152.46 → 1153.52] they have a partnership
[1153.52 → 1154.80] with Curiosity Stream
[1154.80 → 1155.80] that makes it
[1155.80 → 1156.40] so that
[1156.40 → 1158.60] you are basically
[1158.60 → 1159.38] getting Nebula
[1159.38 → 1160.14] for free
[1160.14 → 1161.22] if you sign up
[1161.22 → 1162.38] for Curiosity Stream
[1162.38 → 1163.58] who sponsors
[1163.58 → 1165.54] a lot of Nebula creators
[1165.54 → 1166.56] effectively
[1166.56 → 1168.96] paying creators
[1168.96 → 1170.36] to promote
[1170.36 → 1172.74] getting their
[1172.74 → 1173.50] Nebula
[1173.50 → 1174.66] subscription
[1174.66 → 1175.68] for free.
[1176.22 → 1176.66] So,
[1176.74 → 1177.20] it's like,
[1177.40 → 1178.40] is anybody
[1178.40 → 1179.40] actually paying
[1179.40 → 1179.88] for Nebula?
[1180.22 → 1181.02] Probably.
[1181.60 → 1182.26] But,
[1182.66 → 1183.64] are more people
[1183.64 → 1184.30] likely paying
[1184.30 → 1185.22] for Curiosity Stream
[1185.22 → 1185.94] and getting Nebula
[1185.94 → 1186.68] for free?
[1187.28 → 1187.98] Probably.
[1188.66 → 1189.08] So,
[1189.16 → 1189.60] it's a really
[1189.60 → 1190.46] interesting model
[1190.46 → 1190.90] over there.
[1191.02 → 1191.40] And then,
[1191.80 → 1192.52] the creators
[1192.52 → 1193.18] on Nebula
[1193.18 → 1194.64] are stakeholders
[1194.64 → 1195.68] in Nebula.
[1196.04 → 1196.96] And my understanding
[1196.96 → 1197.80] is that that is
[1197.80 → 1198.58] dependent on
[1198.58 → 1199.80] the size of the creator
[1199.80 → 1200.48] and overall
[1200.48 → 1201.30] contribution to the
[1201.30 → 1202.30] momentum of the platform.
[1202.96 → 1203.52] And so,
[1203.62 → 1204.26] what that means
[1204.26 → 1205.62] is that even if
[1205.62 → 1206.56] your check from Nebula
[1206.56 → 1208.14] is $4 a month
[1208.14 → 1208.62] or whatever,
[1208.80 → 1209.18] because,
[1210.00 → 1210.54] whatever,
[1210.86 → 1212.14] depends on how many people
[1212.14 → 1212.52] are watching,
[1212.64 → 1212.94] I guess,
[1213.08 → 1213.88] they don't have any
[1213.88 → 1215.14] external viewership stats
[1215.14 → 1216.02] or anything like that,
[1216.06 → 1216.82] which usually means
[1216.82 → 1217.58] that it's not
[1217.58 → 1218.20] heavily used.
[1219.04 → 1219.50] So,
[1219.56 → 1220.22] it doesn't matter,
[1220.34 → 1220.52] though,
[1220.56 → 1221.82] if you get a $60 check
[1221.82 → 1222.42] because,
[1222.68 → 1223.02] essentially,
[1223.16 → 1223.96] you're getting paid
[1223.96 → 1224.70] to promote it
[1224.70 → 1226.22] by one of the
[1226.22 → 1228.54] associated media companies
[1228.54 → 1230.20] and then you are,
[1230.54 → 1230.84] maybe,
[1231.26 → 1233.32] in the event of an exit,
[1233.62 → 1234.28] in the event that
[1234.28 → 1235.28] Nebula gets sold,
[1235.62 → 1236.30] you are getting
[1236.30 → 1237.38] some cut
[1237.38 → 1238.88] of that sales check.
[1239.22 → 1239.52] So,
[1239.70 → 1240.50] it's a very,
[1240.60 → 1241.40] very different model.
[1241.94 → 1242.22] It's,
[1242.56 → 1243.54] maybe someday
[1243.54 → 1244.86] something will happen
[1244.86 → 1245.96] and also there's
[1245.96 → 1247.30] this very convenient
[1247.30 → 1248.70] synergy here
[1248.70 → 1249.86] with Curiosity Stream
[1249.86 → 1251.06] that I'm sure
[1251.06 → 1251.58] makes sense
[1251.58 → 1252.54] for Curiosity Stream
[1252.54 → 1253.30] on some level.
[1254.52 → 1255.00] Very,
[1255.10 → 1256.00] very different dynamic
[1256.00 → 1257.16] from what Float plane is,
[1257.20 → 1257.68] which is
[1257.68 → 1258.84] the money
[1258.84 → 1259.62] from the subscribers
[1259.62 → 1260.38] you can drive
[1260.38 → 1261.50] today,
[1261.92 → 1263.08] right now,
[1263.18 → 1264.20] and is sustainable.
[1264.76 → 1265.64] We don't need,
[1265.68 → 1266.20] we don't need
[1266.20 → 1267.62] any external backing,
[1268.12 → 1269.04] nothing like that.
[1269.14 → 1269.62] We are,
[1269.74 → 1270.22] we are,
[1270.28 → 1271.50] we are profitable now.
[1271.56 → 1271.72] It's,
[1271.92 → 1272.56] it's amazing
[1272.56 → 1273.20] how many people
[1273.20 → 1274.38] I still see talking about
[1274.38 → 1275.16] the epic failure
[1275.16 → 1275.96] that was Float plane.
[1277.06 → 1277.58] Guys,
[1277.86 → 1278.50] the numbers
[1278.50 → 1280.02] are right on the site.
[1280.56 → 1282.18] They're right on the site.
[1282.94 → 1283.82] Float plane is doing
[1283.82 → 1286.14] through LTT alone
[1286.14 → 1287.84] at least,
[1288.22 → 1288.72] what is it?
[1289.12 → 1289.64] Calculator,
[1290.06 → 1290.34] okay,
[1290.66 → 1291.48] so five
[1291.48 → 1292.62] times
[1292.62 → 1294.10] 30,000,
[1294.54 → 1295.12] okay,
[1295.48 → 1296.16] here we go.
[1299.78 → 1300.46] Five times
[1300.46 → 1301.84] 30,000 times 12.
[1302.50 → 1303.26] Float plane is doing
[1303.26 → 1303.88] at least
[1303.88 → 1305.52] 1.8 million dollars
[1305.52 → 1306.50] US a year
[1306.50 → 1307.06] in revenue,
[1307.26 → 1307.78] and that's
[1307.78 → 1309.62] just on LTT.
[1309.80 → 1310.42] We don't have a ton
[1310.42 → 1310.82] of creators
[1310.82 → 1311.42] on the platform.
[1312.28 → 1312.94] I admit,
[1313.44 → 1314.34] the model doesn't make
[1314.34 → 1314.86] a ton of sense
[1314.86 → 1315.34] for everyone,
[1315.54 → 1316.48] but what it is,
[1316.54 → 1317.14] is it is
[1317.14 → 1318.08] sustainable.
[1318.64 → 1319.96] And Luke and I,
[1320.02 → 1320.34] I think,
[1320.42 → 1321.58] have been proven
[1321.58 → 1323.52] maybe not right,
[1323.84 → 1325.00] but not wrong
[1325.00 → 1326.58] multiple times
[1326.58 → 1327.60] since Float plane's
[1327.60 → 1327.94] inception.
[1328.40 → 1328.64] I mean,
[1328.70 → 1329.32] look at all the
[1329.32 → 1330.32] controversy there was
[1330.32 → 1331.84] around Patreon and Vimeo
[1331.84 → 1333.10] when Patreon
[1333.10 → 1333.88] was effectively
[1333.88 → 1334.98] having people
[1334.98 → 1335.78] just put up
[1335.78 → 1336.66] unlisted videos
[1336.66 → 1337.16] on YouTube
[1337.16 → 1338.10] for the longest time,
[1338.26 → 1339.06] and then there was
[1339.06 → 1339.58] the integration
[1339.58 → 1340.36] with Vimeo
[1340.36 → 1342.48] where Patreon creators
[1342.48 → 1343.46] were able to use Vimeo
[1343.46 → 1344.22] to host their videos,
[1344.28 → 1345.02] and then all of a sudden
[1345.02 → 1346.68] Vimeo kind of went,
[1347.88 → 1348.56] hmm,
[1348.96 → 1349.70] bandwidth and storage
[1349.70 → 1350.32] are expensive
[1350.32 → 1351.56] if you guys don't
[1351.56 → 1352.38] start paying for
[1352.38 → 1353.72] pro-tier Vimeo hosting,
[1354.26 → 1355.36] all your videos
[1355.36 → 1356.06] are going to go away.
[1356.16 → 1356.60] See you later.
[1356.94 → 1357.82] And then now I think
[1357.82 → 1359.12] Patreon is self-hosting
[1359.12 → 1359.46] video,
[1359.64 → 1361.00] but I haven't actually
[1361.00 → 1361.76] looked at the quality
[1361.76 → 1362.24] of the service
[1362.24 → 1362.80] since then,
[1362.80 → 1363.88] so I can't really
[1363.88 → 1365.00] speak to if it's
[1365.00 → 1366.16] any good or anything
[1366.16 → 1366.74] like that.
[1369.26 → 1369.76] Yeah,
[1369.88 → 1370.38] Level 1 Text
[1370.38 → 1371.38] has another 800
[1371.38 → 1371.90] followers.
[1372.54 → 1374.24] I know Garbage Time
[1374.24 → 1374.64] streams,
[1374.84 → 1375.42] like hundreds.
[1375.80 → 1376.44] I know that
[1376.44 → 1378.42] Forgotten Weapons
[1378.42 → 1379.50] has hundreds,
[1379.74 → 1381.26] if not...
[1381.26 → 1381.76] Oh.
[1387.68 → 1388.42] Forgotten Weapons
[1388.42 → 1389.32] does not disclose
[1389.32 → 1390.20] how many subscribers
[1390.20 → 1391.30] are on Float plane.
[1391.98 → 1392.58] Forgotten Weapons,
[1392.82 → 1393.88] good guy,
[1394.24 → 1395.50] and good channel,
[1395.56 → 1395.98] doing good.
[1396.48 → 1397.58] Why don't I just say that?
[1397.62 → 1398.24] The good news is
[1398.24 → 1399.52] I actually didn't know
[1399.52 → 1400.58] if that number was accurate,
[1400.94 → 1403.60] so you can assume
[1403.60 → 1404.24] it was wrong.
[1407.82 → 1408.22] Neat.
[1408.78 → 1409.46] Let's move on
[1409.46 → 1410.26] to our next topic.
[1411.66 → 1412.66] Wizards of the Coast
[1412.66 → 1414.08] has backpedalled
[1414.08 → 1415.78] on OIL changes
[1415.78 → 1417.18] after community backlash.
[1418.40 → 1419.00] Sort of.
[1419.74 → 1420.94] We've got a big update
[1420.94 → 1421.48] for you guys,
[1421.58 → 1422.14] but first,
[1422.32 → 1422.84] for those of you
[1422.84 → 1423.60] who didn't tune into
[1423.60 → 1424.66] the show last week,
[1424.86 → 1425.46] let's give you
[1425.46 → 1426.44] a little bit,
[1426.56 → 1427.42] let's get you up to speed
[1427.42 → 1427.80] a little bit.
[1427.88 → 1428.64] Wizards of the Coast,
[1429.12 → 1430.30] owned by Hasbro,
[1430.78 → 1431.88] runs Dungeons & Dragons,
[1431.88 → 1435.24] basically had a license
[1435.24 → 1436.82] agreement in place
[1436.82 → 1438.24] with whether it was
[1438.24 → 1439.72] third-party content creators
[1439.72 → 1441.62] or whether it was
[1441.62 → 1444.64] like community-run companies
[1444.64 → 1445.72] or even actually
[1445.72 → 1446.86] companies with
[1446.86 → 1447.90] significant revenues
[1447.90 → 1449.10] based on their
[1449.10 → 1450.08] Dungeons & Dragons IP.
[1450.38 → 1452.12] They had a license in place
[1452.12 → 1454.44] that pretty much allowed you
[1454.44 → 1456.12] to create derivative works
[1456.12 → 1457.72] without paying
[1457.72 → 1459.10] any kind of royalties
[1459.10 → 1460.14] and without worrying
[1460.14 → 1461.00] about any sort of
[1461.00 → 1461.70] legal action.
[1461.88 → 1463.46] The license was perpetual
[1463.46 → 1465.58] and it is a huge part
[1465.58 → 1467.82] of why the D&D community
[1467.82 → 1469.36] has grown so vibrantly
[1469.36 → 1470.30] over the last couple
[1470.30 → 1470.92] of decades.
[1471.48 → 1471.68] I mean,
[1471.72 → 1472.58] we're talking everything
[1472.58 → 1474.54] from third-party add-ons
[1474.54 → 1476.64] to, I mean,
[1476.72 → 1477.20] you know what?
[1477.42 → 1478.70] A perfect example
[1478.70 → 1479.56] of someone that could
[1479.56 → 1480.58] be affected by this
[1480.58 → 1482.24] is that local creator,
[1482.34 → 1482.88] Filthy Lot,
[1483.62 → 1484.38] where they're doing
[1484.38 → 1486.84] those D&D live reenactments,
[1486.84 → 1489.00] where they play the game
[1489.00 → 1489.76] and they do these
[1489.76 → 1491.16] super high production value
[1491.16 → 1491.92] reenactments
[1491.92 → 1493.20] of their tabletop games.
[1493.68 → 1494.90] I could see someone
[1494.90 → 1495.50] like that,
[1496.10 → 1497.40] even if they ultimately
[1497.40 → 1498.50] aren't affected
[1498.50 → 1499.46] and they don't need
[1499.46 → 1501.18] to pay 25%
[1501.18 → 1501.92] of their revenues
[1501.92 → 1503.50] to Wizards of the Coast,
[1503.68 → 1504.52] I could see them
[1504.52 → 1505.22] being worried
[1505.22 → 1506.74] about the legal ramifications
[1506.74 → 1507.78] of the new
[1507.78 → 1508.94] general license.
[1510.06 → 1511.52] And that's one of the things
[1511.52 → 1512.02] that changed.
[1512.02 → 1512.66] All of a sudden,
[1513.26 → 1514.42] almost overnight,
[1514.66 → 1516.02] with almost no warning,
[1516.40 → 1517.10] any companies
[1517.10 → 1518.24] that were profiting
[1518.24 → 1519.50] off of Dungeons & Dragons
[1519.50 → 1521.82] were going to have
[1521.82 → 1523.10] their license agreement
[1523.10 → 1523.92] changed.
[1524.44 → 1525.34] So this included
[1525.34 → 1527.64] a 25% revenue garnish.
[1529.12 → 1530.60] I think you had to submit
[1530.60 → 1531.84] basically anything
[1531.84 → 1533.10] to do with Dungeons & Dragons
[1533.10 → 1533.94] to them for,
[1534.36 → 1535.10] if not approval,
[1535.48 → 1537.02] at least for them
[1537.02 → 1537.90] to look at
[1537.90 → 1538.84] and be aware of.
[1539.36 → 1540.32] There were a handful
[1540.32 → 1540.88] of other,
[1541.04 → 1541.60] particularly,
[1541.60 → 1542.64] awful things
[1542.64 → 1543.32] and it was basically
[1543.32 → 1543.84] going to happen
[1543.84 → 1544.78] in a couple of weeks.
[1544.88 → 1545.78] Now, the thing leaked
[1545.78 → 1547.06] and the community
[1547.06 → 1548.88] got understandably outraged
[1548.88 → 1550.04] because this is
[1550.04 → 1550.80] Wizards of the Coast
[1550.80 → 1551.80] basically coming in
[1551.80 → 1552.30] and going,
[1553.06 → 1553.30] hmm,
[1553.80 → 1555.04] you know what?
[1555.74 → 1557.46] The D&D community,
[1557.76 → 1558.34] the players,
[1558.64 → 1559.52] are woefully
[1559.52 → 1560.64] under-monetized.
[1562.14 → 1563.88] And that's not even me
[1563.88 → 1565.76] just trying to sound
[1565.76 → 1566.84] like an evil executive.
[1567.92 → 1569.92] The CEO of Wizards of the Coast
[1569.92 → 1571.52] actually said that.
[1571.60 → 1573.64] which is terrible.
[1573.80 → 1575.20] Described the player base
[1575.20 → 1577.04] as under-monetized.
[1578.20 → 1578.80] And it's like,
[1580.00 → 1583.04] even if you're right,
[1583.92 → 1584.20] okay,
[1584.52 → 1586.80] even if your NBA ass
[1586.80 → 1589.20] knows what you're talking about,
[1590.20 → 1592.98] come on, man!
[1592.98 → 1595.44] come on!
[1596.44 → 1597.04] You can't,
[1597.58 → 1598.14] that's like,
[1599.26 → 1599.96] it's like,
[1600.00 → 1600.34] oh man,
[1600.42 → 1600.82] how do I,
[1601.20 → 1601.60] how do I,
[1601.80 → 1602.52] it's just,
[1602.60 → 1603.80] it's just disrespectful.
[1604.52 → 1605.38] It's like if I,
[1605.44 → 1607.00] it's like if I referred to you guys
[1607.00 → 1607.34] as,
[1607.38 → 1608.82] as walking wallets
[1608.82 → 1609.78] instead of
[1609.78 → 1611.18] our community,
[1611.58 → 1612.14] right?
[1612.14 → 1614.42] even if I saw you that way,
[1614.74 → 1616.60] even if I fucking did,
[1616.96 → 1617.28] right?
[1617.90 → 1619.10] You're walking wallets,
[1619.14 → 1619.92] pieces of shit,
[1620.42 → 1622.12] even if I felt that way.
[1622.90 → 1625.06] You don't say the quiet part out loud.
[1625.70 → 1627.04] It's not tactful.
[1627.40 → 1628.34] It's disrespectful.
[1628.34 → 1634.00] So anyway,
[1634.38 → 1635.86] let's get you guys up to speed.
[1636.76 → 1638.14] D&D Beyond staff,
[1638.32 → 1638.60] oh,
[1639.00 → 1639.24] oh,
[1639.30 → 1639.52] okay,
[1639.62 → 1640.68] have released a statement
[1640.68 → 1642.36] about the recent OIL changes.
[1642.98 → 1645.10] They have three goals in mind.
[1645.40 → 1645.56] Oh,
[1645.60 → 1647.26] they had three goals in mind.
[1647.44 → 1647.76] Okay.
[1648.30 → 1650.22] To prevent the use of D&D content
[1650.22 → 1651.74] from being included in hateful
[1651.74 → 1653.22] and discriminatory products,
[1655.02 → 1655.42] okay,
[1655.84 → 1657.96] to address those attempting
[1657.96 → 1658.98] to use D&D
[1658.98 → 1661.06] in web three slash blockchain
[1661.06 → 1662.36] slash NFT material.
[1662.50 → 1662.62] Oh,
[1662.66 → 1664.56] I'm already calling bullshit on this
[1664.56 → 1666.32] because the document,
[1666.48 → 1666.58] okay,
[1666.60 → 1667.30] so the original,
[1667.30 → 1668.94] the original license agreement
[1668.94 → 1669.78] was like,
[1669.78 → 1671.02] how many pages?
[1671.22 → 1672.14] I don't remember,
[1672.24 → 1673.94] but the new one's like 900 pages
[1673.94 → 1676.34] and has extensive documentation
[1676.34 → 1677.94] about like web three,
[1678.02 → 1678.68] blockchain,
[1679.20 → 1680.12] NFT crap.
[1680.26 → 1682.14] And as far as I can tell,
[1682.14 → 1683.74] this is not about preventing
[1683.74 → 1684.92] others from doing it.
[1685.04 → 1686.12] This is about making sure
[1686.12 → 1686.94] that they can do it
[1686.94 → 1687.68] and others can't.
[1687.96 → 1688.66] Hmm.
[1688.84 → 1689.20] Anywho,
[1689.30 → 1689.68] hold on.
[1690.14 → 1691.52] And reason number three,
[1691.76 → 1693.26] to ensure that OIL
[1693.26 → 1694.94] is for the content creator
[1694.94 → 1695.82] slash home brewer
[1695.82 → 1697.72] slash aspiring designers,
[1697.88 → 1698.32] et cetera,
[1698.80 → 1699.94] as opposed,
[1700.10 → 1700.40] I guess,
[1700.48 → 1701.64] to anyone who's looking
[1701.64 → 1702.96] to commercially profit off of it.
[1703.00 → 1703.76] But that's the thing.
[1704.02 → 1705.06] You got to understand
[1705.06 → 1706.36] when you create
[1706.36 → 1707.62] an open ecosystem
[1707.62 → 1709.08] where people can profit,
[1709.20 → 1710.94] you create a financial incentive
[1710.94 → 1711.94] for creativity.
[1711.94 → 1712.04] opportunity.
[1713.84 → 1715.30] That's the whole point.
[1716.16 → 1718.06] That's what you benefited from.
[1718.66 → 1719.46] And so now,
[1719.56 → 1720.52] you're basically going,
[1720.94 → 1721.26] hmm,
[1721.42 → 1723.46] this is going great.
[1723.96 → 1725.36] Let's get more benefit.
[1725.36 → 1729.82] All right.
[1730.88 → 1731.86] There were apparently
[1731.86 → 1732.62] two principles
[1732.62 → 1733.72] driving these goals,
[1734.14 → 1735.56] be good stewards of the game,
[1735.66 → 1736.94] and that the OIL exists
[1736.94 → 1738.28] for the benefit of the fans.
[1738.74 → 1739.22] Nothing,
[1739.36 → 1739.84] this is a quote,
[1740.04 → 1741.32] nothing about these principles
[1741.32 → 1743.04] has wavered for a second.
[1743.04 → 1745.46] All the royalty language
[1745.46 → 1746.50] was apparently meant
[1746.50 → 1748.18] to apply to large corporations
[1748.18 → 1750.00] attempting to use OIL content
[1750.00 → 1751.20] and wasn't meant to impact
[1751.20 → 1752.10] the vast majority
[1752.10 → 1753.00] of the community.
[1753.64 → 1754.08] Man,
[1754.16 → 1754.68] that's the problem
[1754.68 → 1755.60] when the lawyers get involved.
[1755.66 → 1756.48] Even if that's true,
[1756.66 → 1758.08] even if that was the intent,
[1758.44 → 1759.74] the problem is that
[1759.74 → 1761.58] the OIL
[1761.58 → 1764.66] seems to give them
[1764.66 → 1765.58] a lot of flexibility
[1765.58 → 1766.40] to crack down
[1766.40 → 1767.44] on pretty much anything
[1767.44 → 1768.70] that they didn't agree with.
[1769.28 → 1770.18] The next OIL
[1770.18 → 1771.76] will contain provisions.
[1772.00 → 1772.68] This is going back
[1772.68 → 1773.44] to this.
[1773.72 → 1774.80] To protect and cultivate
[1774.80 → 1775.94] an inclusive environment,
[1776.42 → 1776.88] education,
[1777.08 → 1777.26] charity,
[1777.34 → 1777.70] live streams,
[1777.82 → 1778.12] cosplay,
[1778.22 → 1778.50] et cetera,
[1778.50 → 1779.76] will remain unaffected.
[1780.60 → 1780.84] Okay,
[1780.98 → 1782.38] but man,
[1782.46 → 1783.32] there's some really,
[1783.32 → 1785.42] there's some really fine lines here,
[1785.82 → 1786.12] right?
[1786.28 → 1786.58] Like,
[1787.06 → 1787.46] okay,
[1787.66 → 1789.06] what is cosplay?
[1790.28 → 1791.66] If I dress up
[1791.66 → 1795.32] as some D&D IP character
[1795.86 → 1797.16] or class of character,
[1797.68 → 1797.82] what,
[1798.02 → 1798.32] I mean,
[1798.80 → 1799.56] can you,
[1799.66 → 1800.52] can you copyright
[1800.52 → 1801.76] a fucking elf
[1801.76 → 1803.10] at this point,
[1803.34 → 1803.60] right?
[1804.38 → 1805.52] I don't think so.
[1805.82 → 1806.00] So,
[1806.12 → 1806.34] okay,
[1806.52 → 1806.80] so I,
[1806.90 → 1807.24] so I,
[1807.30 → 1807.86] so I,
[1807.86 → 1808.72] I'm cosplaying
[1808.72 → 1810.14] some D&D something
[1810.14 → 1810.52] and it's,
[1810.52 → 1811.00] it's clearly,
[1811.14 → 1811.88] let's say it's clearly
[1811.88 → 1812.44] infringing,
[1812.56 → 1812.76] right?
[1812.76 → 1814.58] Um,
[1815.30 → 1817.94] what if I cosplay
[1817.94 → 1819.52] and I'm in a video?
[1820.82 → 1822.08] What if that video
[1822.08 → 1822.70] is monetized?
[1823.20 → 1824.50] What if I didn't profit,
[1824.96 → 1826.10] but the maker of the video
[1826.10 → 1826.54] profited?
[1827.12 → 1827.76] What if I,
[1827.96 → 1829.02] what if I'm not in a video?
[1829.30 → 1830.06] What if I'm just
[1830.06 → 1830.74] at a con?
[1831.12 → 1831.68] I'm at,
[1831.68 → 1832.60] I'm at like some,
[1832.70 → 1833.36] I'm at PAX
[1833.36 → 1834.52] or I'm at Comic Con
[1834.52 → 1834.88] or I'm,
[1835.00 → 1835.84] I'm at something,
[1835.96 → 1836.80] I'm at some kind of,
[1836.80 → 1838.32] I'm at some kind of gaming convention.
[1839.46 → 1840.20] What if,
[1840.82 → 1841.28] what if,
[1841.28 → 1841.54] you know,
[1841.64 → 1841.92] I mean,
[1841.96 → 1842.92] imagine me,
[1842.96 → 1843.24] okay?
[1843.44 → 1844.48] I want to be like,
[1844.60 → 1846.06] I want to be a sexy elf,
[1846.28 → 1846.56] okay?
[1846.76 → 1847.22] You know,
[1847.24 → 1848.14] I've got a bikini
[1848.14 → 1849.12] as part of my,
[1849.16 → 1850.16] as part of my cosplay,
[1850.72 → 1851.00] right?
[1851.44 → 1851.84] Exactly,
[1852.00 → 1852.20] right?
[1852.48 → 1852.80] So,
[1853.08 → 1854.00] someone slips a
[1854.06 → 1855.22] someone slips a one
[1855.22 → 1856.20] to my G-string.
[1856.90 → 1857.26] Okay,
[1857.34 → 1858.32] have I profited now?
[1858.36 → 1859.08] Is this commercial?
[1866.86 → 1868.64] There are clearly some fine lines here
[1868.64 → 1869.54] is what I'm trying to say.
[1869.54 → 1870.94] Now,
[1871.00 → 1871.70] they also say,
[1871.76 → 1874.28] content released under 1.0a
[1874.28 → 1875.78] will remain unaffected.
[1876.32 → 1877.94] No royalty structure included,
[1878.22 → 1879.64] no license back provision
[1879.64 → 1880.70] under the new OIL,
[1880.94 → 1882.52] you will own the content you create.
[1883.16 → 1883.48] Okay?
[1884.04 → 1886.02] They've also said that the OIL update
[1886.02 → 1887.08] will not release today,
[1887.18 → 1887.86] but it is coming.
[1888.02 → 1889.46] What we saw was a draft
[1889.46 → 1890.54] sent out to content creators.
[1891.08 → 1892.54] Nobody drafts
[1893.44 → 1894.44] a document like,
[1894.80 → 1894.96] well,
[1895.06 → 1895.32] okay,
[1895.32 → 1895.64] yes,
[1895.72 → 1897.30] you do draft a document like that,
[1897.76 → 1898.10] but
[1898.10 → 1899.42] a draft
[1899.42 → 1900.88] of a document like that
[1900.88 → 1901.88] is unlikely
[1901.88 → 1903.08] to be so
[1903.08 → 1903.76] far
[1903.76 → 1904.44] off
[1904.44 → 1905.14] the mark.
[1905.14 → 1906.70] If it was all about
[1906.70 → 1908.22] cultivating
[1908.22 → 1909.02] and
[1909.02 → 1910.10] inclusivity
[1910.10 → 1911.86] as opposed to
[1911.86 → 1913.12] where's my money?
[1913.66 → 1914.34] Where's my money,
[1914.46 → 1914.72] bitch?
[1914.72 → 1922.36] Um,
[1922.88 → 1923.56] all right.
[1924.40 → 1925.86] There was a very cheeky
[1925.86 → 1926.78] and salty line
[1926.78 → 1927.36] that was,
[1927.38 → 1927.86] uh,
[1927.90 → 1929.52] applied to this announcement
[1929.52 → 1930.94] that is being made fun of online.
[1931.52 → 1931.96] Second,
[1932.22 → 1933.36] you're going to hear people say
[1933.36 → 1933.90] that they won
[1933.90 → 1934.60] and we lost
[1934.60 → 1936.04] because making your voices heard
[1936.04 → 1937.44] forced us to change our plans.
[1938.36 → 1940.38] Those people will only be half right.
[1940.72 → 1941.30] They won
[1941.30 → 1942.40] and so, did we?
[1942.40 → 1947.42] What the fuck is wrong with you?
[1951.30 → 1952.90] Who talks like that?
[1953.54 → 1956.06] Who sends a letter like that
[1956.06 → 1957.60] to their customers?
[1958.92 → 1959.58] That's like,
[1959.70 → 1961.12] that's like them releasing
[1961.12 → 1962.36] a fucking t-shirt.
[1962.96 → 1963.86] That's like,
[1963.86 → 1973.24] trust me, bro.
[1973.94 → 1975.02] The new OIL
[1975.02 → 1975.78] will be epic.
[1980.00 → 1980.54] Okay,
[1980.64 → 1981.48] but seriously,
[1982.20 → 1983.96] seriously though,
[1984.10 → 1986.68] in the case of the warranty drama,
[1987.14 → 1988.56] our track record
[1988.56 → 1989.86] and our intent
[1989.86 → 1991.08] was clear.
[1991.08 → 1992.98] We have always
[1992.98 → 1995.44] had a basic policy
[1995.44 → 1996.36] for customer care.
[1996.64 → 1997.84] Make it right.
[1998.92 → 2000.20] We got a little slow.
[2000.64 → 2000.86] Okay,
[2000.90 → 2001.96] we have quadrupled
[2001.96 → 2003.54] the size of our customer care team.
[2004.08 → 2004.44] Um,
[2004.64 → 2005.34] we are actually,
[2005.58 → 2006.46] I was told
[2006.46 → 2007.24] that by today
[2007.24 → 2008.80] we would be down to 24 hours
[2008.80 → 2009.72] and,
[2009.82 → 2010.24] uh,
[2010.24 → 2011.54] we haven't actually told
[2011.54 → 2012.70] anyone yet,
[2012.80 → 2013.76] but some of the temps
[2013.76 → 2014.34] I believe
[2014.34 → 2015.42] will actually be retained
[2015.42 → 2016.58] because we're going to be
[2016.58 → 2017.50] building new systems
[2017.50 → 2018.48] whenever there's downtime
[2018.48 → 2019.48] when it comes to actually
[2019.48 → 2020.46] responding to tickets.
[2020.46 → 2021.00] Uh,
[2021.00 → 2021.48] one of the things
[2021.48 → 2022.24] we're going to start doing
[2022.24 → 2023.36] is combing through reviews
[2023.36 → 2024.44] on the site for feedback.
[2024.76 → 2025.08] Uh,
[2025.08 → 2026.18] we're going to be compiling that
[2026.18 → 2027.40] for the product development team.
[2027.58 → 2027.70] So,
[2028.02 → 2028.50] essentially,
[2029.38 → 2029.62] like,
[2029.74 → 2030.16] customer,
[2030.78 → 2031.20] customer,
[2031.68 → 2031.98] you know,
[2032.08 → 2033.92] ticket answer department
[2033.92 → 2035.56] is going to turn into
[2035.56 → 2036.72] more of like a customer
[2036.72 → 2038.00] experience department
[2038.00 → 2039.36] and is going to be
[2039.36 → 2040.80] designed to continue
[2040.80 → 2042.26] to make everything better,
[2042.62 → 2042.92] uh,
[2042.92 → 2043.98] from response times
[2043.98 → 2044.78] to,
[2044.78 → 2045.70] uh,
[2045.70 → 2046.92] to future products
[2046.92 → 2047.48] to even,
[2047.66 → 2049.32] even like midstream reviews,
[2049.50 → 2050.22] midstream reviews,
[2050.46 → 2051.32] midstream improvements
[2051.32 → 2052.30] on existing products.
[2052.38 → 2053.08] You can expect to see
[2053.08 → 2053.98] all of that from us
[2053.98 → 2054.48] in the future.
[2055.02 → 2055.18] Uh,
[2055.18 → 2055.32] oh,
[2055.36 → 2056.10] apparently it's called
[2056.10 → 2057.24] customer satisfaction.
[2057.46 → 2058.48] Is that what the department's called?
[2059.34 → 2059.78] Okay,
[2059.86 → 2060.18] whatever,
[2060.46 → 2060.90] whatever,
[2061.12 → 2062.68] whatever we end up calling it,
[2062.78 → 2063.14] it's,
[2063.28 → 2063.56] it's,
[2063.62 → 2064.42] it's not just about
[2064.42 → 2065.34] answering tickets.
[2065.34 → 2066.26] Um,
[2066.42 → 2066.86] and,
[2066.86 → 2066.90] and,
[2066.90 → 2070.56] the t-shirt was a miscalculation.
[2072.56 → 2073.62] I'm not gonna lie,
[2073.76 → 2074.84] I still think it's funny.
[2075.66 → 2076.10] But,
[2076.20 → 2077.36] I live in my head
[2077.36 → 2078.76] where I knew my intent
[2078.76 → 2079.30] all along.
[2079.48 → 2080.70] And the thing that I missed
[2080.70 → 2081.34] in all of that,
[2081.40 → 2082.60] the thing I totally missed
[2082.60 → 2083.26] in all of it,
[2083.46 → 2084.10] was that
[2084.10 → 2085.26] a lot of you don't.
[2086.30 → 2086.56] Right?
[2086.98 → 2087.66] You don't.
[2087.90 → 2089.62] You don't know what my intention was,
[2089.62 → 2090.76] and I've told you guys,
[2091.00 → 2091.22] you know,
[2091.38 → 2091.76] don't,
[2091.76 → 2092.20] don't,
[2092.26 → 2092.78] don't trust.
[2092.90 → 2094.30] Or at very most,
[2094.36 → 2095.20] trust but verify.
[2095.36 → 2095.52] Right?
[2096.02 → 2096.46] And,
[2096.62 → 2097.06] so,
[2097.64 → 2098.94] for me, it was very obvious.
[2099.06 → 2099.80] I'm looking at it going,
[2099.92 → 2099.98] well,
[2100.00 → 2101.84] I've got this super long track record
[2101.84 → 2103.04] of taking care of our community.
[2103.46 → 2103.80] Also,
[2104.08 → 2105.08] even if I didn't,
[2105.44 → 2106.92] I would be insane.
[2107.46 → 2108.72] I'd be insane
[2108.72 → 2110.12] to screw anyone over.
[2110.50 → 2112.24] If we actually did.
[2112.60 → 2112.84] Right?
[2113.22 → 2113.64] Like,
[2114.00 → 2115.30] if we actually did.
[2115.44 → 2117.24] Look at how much it blew up
[2117.24 → 2118.66] when we didn't
[2118.66 → 2120.28] actually screw anyone over.
[2121.06 → 2122.38] If we actually
[2122.38 → 2123.54] just started denying
[2123.54 → 2124.88] warranty claims
[2124.88 → 2125.70] on products
[2125.70 → 2126.56] on our store,
[2126.80 → 2128.26] it would explode.
[2128.76 → 2129.48] It would explode
[2129.48 → 2130.70] the entire ecosphere.
[2132.10 → 2133.14] I'm not a sucker
[2133.14 → 2134.20] for that kind of punishment.
[2135.14 → 2135.30] So,
[2135.46 → 2136.36] from my point of view,
[2136.62 → 2136.96] it was,
[2137.14 → 2137.28] A,
[2137.30 → 2138.22] I've got this track record
[2138.22 → 2138.56] and B,
[2138.60 → 2139.38] isn't this obvious.
[2141.36 → 2141.80] But,
[2141.92 → 2142.72] from your point of view,
[2143.02 → 2143.60] maybe you were
[2143.60 → 2144.48] a first time viewer
[2144.48 → 2145.02] of that show.
[2145.68 → 2146.50] Maybe you're a first time
[2146.50 → 2147.10] viewer of this show.
[2147.10 → 2148.34] It's usually not like this.
[2149.14 → 2149.74] Maybe you were
[2149.74 → 2150.56] a first time viewer
[2150.56 → 2151.10] of that show,
[2151.18 → 2151.38] right?
[2151.62 → 2152.52] Maybe you'd never
[2152.52 → 2153.68] ordered from the store before.
[2153.78 → 2154.72] Maybe you actually had
[2154.72 → 2156.18] no context whatsoever
[2156.18 → 2157.48] for what our policies were.
[2157.68 → 2159.16] And maybe all you saw
[2159.16 → 2159.98] was,
[2160.18 → 2160.78] uh,
[2161.92 → 2163.38] quite wealthy
[2163.38 → 2165.70] influencer.
[2166.54 → 2167.24] That's a reference
[2167.24 → 2168.02] to last week's show
[2168.02 → 2168.32] as well.
[2168.86 → 2169.24] Um,
[2169.64 → 2170.40] basically,
[2170.62 → 2170.84] you know,
[2170.84 → 2171.20] saying,
[2171.34 → 2171.78] you know,
[2171.82 → 2172.20] F you,
[2172.28 → 2172.96] you want a warranty?
[2173.18 → 2173.40] Well,
[2173.60 → 2174.14] you know,
[2174.74 → 2175.54] go fuck yourself
[2175.54 → 2176.00] basically,
[2176.10 → 2176.32] right?
[2176.64 → 2177.08] And,
[2177.08 → 2177.68] and that was
[2177.68 → 2178.58] never my intention,
[2179.06 → 2179.30] uh,
[2179.34 → 2179.66] but,
[2180.38 → 2181.02] I think we've
[2181.02 → 2181.74] made good on it.
[2181.92 → 2182.24] And,
[2182.38 → 2183.28] I think that
[2183.28 → 2184.18] in the same way,
[2184.62 → 2185.32] even though they
[2185.32 → 2186.06] issued this
[2186.06 → 2187.48] spectacularly
[2187.48 → 2188.42] stupid statement,
[2188.42 → 2189.64] um,
[2189.72 → 2190.56] they still have
[2190.56 → 2191.16] an opportunity
[2191.16 → 2192.38] to not screw
[2192.38 → 2192.88] this up.
[2194.98 → 2196.30] They still can!
[2196.58 → 2197.52] They haven't
[2197.52 → 2198.66] actually released
[2198.66 → 2199.30] the new OIL.
[2200.40 → 2201.72] Until they do,
[2202.26 → 2203.32] they can still
[2203.32 → 2204.16] reverse course.
[2208.02 → 2208.54] Well,
[2208.66 → 2208.86] yeah,
[2209.02 → 2209.26] okay,
[2209.40 → 2210.26] so Luke's,
[2210.30 → 2211.38] Luke's got some thoughts.
[2211.86 → 2212.08] Um,
[2212.08 → 2213.00] they have already
[2213.00 → 2214.40] permanently alienated
[2214.40 → 2215.58] large parts of the community.
[2215.58 → 2216.28] This is true.
[2216.28 → 2216.44] And,
[2216.50 → 2217.42] all in the name of what?
[2217.52 → 2218.10] Inclusivity?
[2218.78 → 2220.28] Good fucking job.
[2220.96 → 2221.38] Um,
[2222.54 → 2223.38] and,
[2223.72 → 2225.30] they have also,
[2225.68 → 2226.86] if the idea here
[2226.86 → 2228.22] was to not allow
[2228.22 → 2229.44] potential competitors
[2229.44 → 2230.52] to benefit
[2230.52 → 2231.66] from their content,
[2232.18 → 2232.50] man,
[2232.74 → 2234.04] this was the biggest
[2234.04 → 2235.00] shot in the arm
[2235.00 → 2235.68] that they could have
[2235.68 → 2236.80] possibly given
[2236.80 → 2237.50] to their competitors.
[2238.04 → 2238.36] Uh,
[2238.50 → 2239.76] just this morning,
[2240.12 → 2240.50] PAIO
[2240.50 → 2241.94] began solidifying
[2241.94 → 2243.04] their own OIL.
[2243.04 → 2243.90] It will apparently
[2243.90 → 2245.00] be system agnostic,
[2245.52 → 2245.92] perpetual,
[2245.92 → 2247.34] and irrevocable.
[2247.72 → 2249.26] An open RPG
[2249.26 → 2250.22] creative license,
[2250.36 → 2250.90] ORC,
[2251.00 → 2251.44] they are looking
[2251.44 → 2252.50] for a non-profit
[2252.50 → 2253.12] organization
[2253.12 → 2254.10] with a history
[2254.10 → 2255.02] of open source values
[2255.02 → 2256.10] to own the license.
[2256.50 → 2257.16] This would be similar
[2257.16 → 2258.16] to the Linux Foundation.
[2258.70 → 2259.10] And,
[2259.36 → 2260.68] are essentially
[2260.68 → 2261.60] coming in
[2261.60 → 2262.10] and saying,
[2262.46 → 2264.48] even if these guys
[2264.48 → 2265.34] reverse course,
[2265.70 → 2266.68] what they've shown
[2266.68 → 2267.86] is that
[2267.86 → 2269.28] you're a walking wallet
[2269.28 → 2270.82] and you can't trust them.
[2270.82 → 2273.52] I mean,
[2273.66 → 2274.14] yes,
[2274.60 → 2275.12] technically,
[2275.62 → 2277.26] the original OIL,
[2277.66 → 2278.44] technically,
[2278.90 → 2279.94] the original OIL,
[2280.20 → 2281.32] while it was perpetual,
[2281.74 → 2283.16] was not irrevocable.
[2284.16 → 2285.02] They're not
[2285.02 → 2285.80] probably
[2285.80 → 2287.48] outside
[2287.48 → 2288.82] what is legal,
[2289.10 → 2289.88] but they are
[2289.88 → 2291.44] outside what is,
[2291.58 → 2292.46] in my opinion,
[2292.78 → 2294.02] morally acceptable.
[2294.02 → 2295.34] When I see
[2295.34 → 2296.72] a perpetual license,
[2297.10 → 2298.02] that doesn't mean
[2298.02 → 2298.58] to me,
[2299.22 → 2299.50] hey,
[2300.10 → 2301.28] this is going
[2301.28 → 2302.00] really great,
[2302.26 → 2303.02] I'm creating
[2303.02 → 2304.16] all of this content
[2304.16 → 2306.00] in this amazing
[2306.00 → 2306.78] ecosystem
[2306.78 → 2308.30] that is going
[2308.30 → 2309.44] to be mine
[2309.44 → 2310.14] as part of this
[2310.14 → 2311.28] ecosystem forever,
[2311.50 → 2313.16] and I can monetize,
[2313.24 → 2313.66] and I can use
[2313.66 → 2314.90] to hire great creatives
[2314.90 → 2315.84] to make more content,
[2315.92 → 2316.32] this is going
[2316.32 → 2317.00] to be amazing,
[2317.34 → 2317.76] and we're going
[2317.76 → 2318.60] to do this forever,
[2318.60 → 2319.38] and oh,
[2319.42 → 2320.02] by the way,
[2320.44 → 2321.84] one day you can say,
[2322.04 → 2322.22] um,
[2322.26 → 2323.08] actually no,
[2323.20 → 2323.96] and then all of that
[2323.96 → 2324.56] will change,
[2324.62 → 2325.42] and now you're gleaning
[2325.42 → 2326.88] 25% of my revenue.
[2328.26 → 2328.74] No,
[2328.92 → 2330.06] when I hear perpetual,
[2330.64 → 2332.16] what I understand
[2332.16 → 2333.44] is not perpetual
[2333.44 → 2335.30] but like then,
[2335.64 → 2336.36] and then like
[2336.36 → 2337.56] less perpetual later,
[2338.04 → 2338.70] I think that,
[2338.84 → 2339.24] I think,
[2339.32 → 2339.56] you know,
[2339.68 → 2341.12] from a non-lawyer standpoint,
[2341.34 → 2342.06] I think that means
[2342.06 → 2342.54] perpetual,
[2343.24 → 2343.56] right?
[2343.56 → 2344.12] Like,
[2344.30 → 2345.26] we've got a document
[2345.26 → 2345.94] called the
[2345.94 → 2347.10] Perpetual WAN Show
[2347.10 → 2347.60] Document,
[2348.26 → 2348.50] okay?
[2348.72 → 2349.56] That doesn't mean
[2349.56 → 2350.00] that every,
[2350.16 → 2351.02] that this WAN Show
[2351.02 → 2352.60] document is perpetual
[2352.60 → 2354.00] until we decide
[2354.00 → 2354.74] to make a
[2354.74 → 2355.34] uh,
[2355.42 → 2356.86] an ephemeral
[2356.86 → 2358.22] WAN Show
[2358.22 → 2358.72] document,
[2358.98 → 2360.02] okay?
[2361.50 → 2362.16] It's perpetual,
[2362.32 → 2362.94] this is the only
[2362.94 → 2363.74] WAN Show document.
[2364.16 → 2364.74] We used to have
[2364.74 → 2365.50] a separate document
[2365.50 → 2366.02] every week,
[2366.12 → 2366.92] but we now have
[2366.92 → 2367.40] a perpetual
[2367.40 → 2368.28] WAN Show document
[2368.28 → 2369.10] because that way
[2369.10 → 2369.58] we don't have to
[2369.58 → 2370.28] make sure it's shared
[2370.28 → 2371.00] to all the stupid
[2371.00 → 2371.64] accounts on all
[2371.64 → 2372.28] the different computers
[2372.28 → 2373.02] and everything every week.
[2374.54 → 2374.78] Uh,
[2374.88 → 2375.04] yeah,
[2375.10 → 2375.66] team viewer,
[2376.02 → 2378.58] jamfunk919119,
[2378.58 → 2379.62] in float plane chat.
[2379.68 → 2379.78] Yeah,
[2379.82 → 2380.22] exactly.
[2380.46 → 2381.68] When I buy a perpetual
[2381.68 → 2382.62] license to your
[2382.62 → 2383.52] fucking software,
[2383.74 → 2384.60] that means it's
[2384.60 → 2385.20] mine forever,
[2385.28 → 2386.30] not it's perpetually
[2386.30 → 2387.22] mine until you decide
[2387.22 → 2388.10] it isn't mine anymore.
[2388.76 → 2389.18] No,
[2389.44 → 2389.70] no,
[2389.90 → 2390.10] no,
[2390.18 → 2390.64] forget it.
[2391.60 → 2391.84] Uh,
[2391.84 → 2392.10] all right,
[2392.14 → 2392.72] so our discussion
[2392.72 → 2393.48] questions here.
[2393.94 → 2394.40] Who should take
[2394.40 → 2395.18] charge of ORC?
[2395.26 → 2395.44] I mean,
[2395.50 → 2395.84] honestly,
[2395.94 → 2396.62] I don't have enough
[2396.62 → 2397.76] experience in it to say.
[2398.50 → 2398.86] Um,
[2399.20 → 2399.86] how truthful,
[2399.98 → 2400.10] oh,
[2400.16 → 2400.68] this is great.
[2400.78 → 2401.26] Some of our other
[2401.26 → 2401.90] discussion questions
[2401.90 → 2402.42] are really great,
[2402.48 → 2402.60] though.
[2403.06 → 2403.28] Uh,
[2403.28 → 2403.50] Luke,
[2403.68 → 2405.94] if you think it was
[2405.94 → 2406.88] truthful that
[2406.88 → 2407.92] Wizards of the Coast's
[2407.92 → 2409.00] intent was to stop
[2409.00 → 2410.98] bigotry and NFTs,
[2411.56 → 2412.12] say nothing.
[2413.20 → 2413.70] Or wait,
[2413.80 → 2413.94] no,
[2414.04 → 2414.58] don't say it,
[2414.66 → 2415.34] say something.
[2415.76 → 2416.02] Crap.
[2416.02 → 2417.18] I set that whole
[2417.18 → 2417.80] thing up and then
[2417.80 → 2418.56] I got it completely
[2418.56 → 2418.88] wrong.
[2419.06 → 2419.34] Fuck.
[2421.02 → 2421.50] Bitch.
[2425.50 → 2425.94] Uh,
[2426.36 → 2428.02] okay.
[2428.84 → 2429.44] Uh,
[2429.56 → 2430.78] and not capitalizing
[2430.78 → 2431.48] at ORC,
[2431.48 → 2432.58] orcs versus humans,
[2432.74 → 2433.50] not ORC.
[2433.60 → 2434.42] I have no idea
[2434.42 → 2434.92] what you're talking
[2434.92 → 2435.20] about now.
[2435.32 → 2435.58] Anyway,
[2435.70 → 2436.32] I'm talking about now.
[2436.92 → 2437.34] Um,
[2437.62 → 2438.10] Luke says,
[2438.40 → 2439.22] I think you can even
[2439.22 → 2440.82] say things like your
[2440.82 → 2442.24] fan slash user base
[2442.24 → 2442.72] is woefully
[2442.72 → 2443.50] under monetized,
[2443.66 → 2444.92] but yes,
[2445.22 → 2445.90] yes,
[2446.62 → 2447.28] this is what,
[2447.36 → 2447.82] I was trying to
[2447.82 → 2448.72] explain the situation
[2448.72 → 2449.82] to Yvonne over,
[2449.82 → 2450.44] uh,
[2450.44 → 2451.26] dinner last night
[2451.26 → 2452.64] where she was like,
[2452.92 → 2453.34] um,
[2453.68 → 2453.92] sorry,
[2454.08 → 2454.74] like what's,
[2454.84 → 2455.58] what's going on?
[2455.62 → 2456.42] Like she never,
[2456.42 → 2457.26] never played Dungeons
[2457.26 → 2457.78] and Dragons.
[2458.30 → 2458.34] Like,
[2458.50 → 2459.10] I mean,
[2459.42 → 2459.66] she,
[2459.80 → 2461.50] she has kind of a
[2461.50 → 2462.34] knack for legal
[2462.34 → 2463.32] documents and like
[2463.32 → 2464.14] license agreements
[2464.14 → 2464.98] and stuff these days
[2464.98 → 2466.54] because in the absence
[2466.54 → 2467.76] of a company lawyer,
[2467.76 → 2468.26] she did,
[2468.60 → 2469.48] she read a lot of
[2469.48 → 2470.66] legal documents for us
[2470.66 → 2472.22] and had to learn
[2472.22 → 2472.94] to understand them
[2472.94 → 2473.70] for the most part
[2473.70 → 2474.36] because like,
[2474.50 → 2475.46] even when we had a
[2475.46 → 2475.72] lawyer,
[2476.02 → 2476.36] uh,
[2476.36 → 2477.82] in many of the early days,
[2477.82 → 2479.06] we couldn't just afford
[2479.06 → 2479.88] to have that lawyer
[2479.88 → 2480.74] like sit and look at
[2480.74 → 2481.18] everything.
[2481.40 → 2482.60] So we would look at it,
[2482.72 → 2483.22] figure out what our
[2483.22 → 2483.82] questions are,
[2483.92 → 2484.66] what sections they
[2484.66 → 2485.38] needed to look at
[2485.38 → 2486.72] and just utilize them
[2486.72 → 2487.48] as little as possible.
[2487.48 → 2488.46] Lawyers be expensive,
[2488.58 → 2488.86] all right?
[2488.86 → 2489.80] Um,
[2489.86 → 2491.88] so she hadn't even seen the
[2491.88 → 2492.18] document,
[2492.18 → 2492.84] but I'm like kind of
[2492.84 → 2493.58] trying to explain
[2493.58 → 2494.64] what's going on
[2494.64 → 2495.00] and I'm like,
[2495.04 → 2495.16] yeah,
[2495.26 → 2496.00] they're basically,
[2496.82 → 2497.72] what they're doing
[2497.72 → 2498.74] is they're taking this
[2498.74 → 2500.16] existing vibrant
[2500.16 → 2501.06] ecosystem, and they're
[2501.06 → 2501.24] going,
[2501.48 → 2502.62] how much can I squeeze
[2502.62 → 2502.90] it?
[2503.60 → 2504.72] How much value can I
[2504.72 → 2505.34] extract?
[2505.50 → 2506.38] Instead of asking
[2506.38 → 2506.96] themselves,
[2507.24 → 2508.72] how much value can I
[2508.72 → 2509.18] provide?
[2509.18 → 2510.76] And I don't think
[2510.76 → 2511.76] anyone would have
[2511.76 → 2513.12] complained if they
[2513.12 → 2514.00] had come up with
[2514.00 → 2516.00] some amazing new
[2516.00 → 2517.08] offering for their
[2517.08 → 2518.76] customers and said,
[2518.90 → 2519.12] hey,
[2519.80 → 2521.82] but this costs money.
[2523.52 → 2524.00] They,
[2524.22 → 2524.38] well,
[2524.48 → 2524.62] oh,
[2524.66 → 2525.04] they might have
[2525.04 → 2525.46] complained,
[2525.58 → 2525.84] sure.
[2525.84 → 2527.26] but it wouldn't
[2527.26 → 2528.58] have been like this.
[2528.66 → 2529.72] It didn't have to be
[2529.72 → 2530.36] like this.
[2531.02 → 2531.38] Um,
[2532.70 → 2533.76] that would increase
[2533.76 → 2534.36] monetization.
[2534.98 → 2535.24] Yeah,
[2535.30 → 2536.44] so the example that
[2536.44 → 2537.62] Luke was thinking was,
[2537.96 → 2538.22] you know,
[2538.28 → 2538.90] how do you,
[2539.08 → 2539.92] how do you increase
[2539.92 → 2540.76] your monetization by
[2540.76 → 2541.74] offering something new?
[2541.86 → 2543.20] So instead of offering
[2543.20 → 2544.96] just t-shirts on LTT
[2544.96 → 2545.34] store,
[2545.52 → 2546.86] we developed a
[2546.86 → 2547.18] backpack,
[2547.44 → 2548.10] we developed a
[2548.10 → 2548.62] screwdriver.
[2549.04 → 2549.40] Uh,
[2549.40 → 2550.50] the point is not to
[2550.50 → 2551.92] just increase the
[2551.92 → 2552.72] price of t-shirts,
[2552.80 → 2553.80] which is you guys know,
[2553.90 → 2555.04] we have never actually
[2555.04 → 2555.36] done.
[2555.36 → 2557.02] Our t-shirts are still
[2557.02 → 2558.42] $19.99 US,
[2558.80 → 2559.36] which is $20.
[2560.00 → 2560.66] I know.
[2560.98 → 2562.10] They're still $20 US
[2562.10 → 2562.44] dollars,
[2562.58 → 2563.62] just like they always
[2563.62 → 2564.10] have been,
[2564.18 → 2564.98] regardless of whether
[2564.98 → 2565.86] they're blank or printed.
[2566.34 → 2566.52] Uh,
[2566.52 → 2566.88] by the way,
[2566.92 → 2567.44] I have a bit of an
[2567.44 → 2568.26] update for you guys.
[2568.34 → 2568.86] We are apparently
[2568.86 → 2570.14] working with three or
[2570.14 → 2571.58] four printing shops
[2571.58 → 2572.00] locally,
[2572.20 → 2573.00] trying to get some
[2573.00 → 2573.68] samples in.
[2574.06 → 2574.28] Uh,
[2574.28 → 2574.92] the thing that drives me
[2574.92 → 2575.98] most crazy about our
[2575.98 → 2577.08] previous printer is that
[2577.08 → 2578.24] the quality was great.
[2578.32 → 2579.72] We actually loved
[2579.72 → 2580.68] working with them.
[2585.36 → 2586.54] Oh,
[2586.66 → 2587.30] I keep saying
[2587.30 → 2588.14] ORC,
[2588.80 → 2589.16] uh,
[2589.20 → 2590.24] when referencing the
[2590.24 → 2591.36] Open RGB creative
[2591.36 → 2591.68] license,
[2591.78 → 2592.28] but it's apparently
[2592.28 → 2592.72] ORC.
[2593.60 → 2593.80] Oh,
[2593.80 → 2594.46] that makes sense.
[2595.48 → 2595.96] Hilarious.
[2596.56 → 2597.42] I'm also not
[2597.42 → 2598.16] technically wrong.
[2598.24 → 2598.88] It's all caps.
[2600.76 → 2601.58] Technically right.
[2601.84 → 2602.74] The best kind of
[2602.74 → 2602.96] right.
[2603.68 → 2604.06] Actually,
[2604.14 → 2604.58] the quote is
[2604.58 → 2605.42] technically correct.
[2606.42 → 2606.48] But,
[2606.62 → 2608.92] let's get,
[2608.92 → 2609.76] let's get pedantic
[2609.76 → 2610.12] today,
[2610.20 → 2610.56] shall we?
[2610.56 → 2611.82] Um,
[2612.96 → 2613.74] why don't we,
[2613.84 → 2614.78] why don't we get to
[2614.78 → 2615.54] a couple of merch
[2615.54 → 2615.92] messages,
[2616.04 → 2616.36] actually?
[2616.56 → 2617.40] If you guys want to
[2617.40 → 2618.16] send a message into
[2618.16 → 2618.60] the show,
[2618.68 → 2619.44] the way to do it
[2619.44 → 2620.72] today is through a
[2620.72 → 2622.24] new feature that we
[2622.24 → 2623.56] developed to add
[2623.56 → 2624.52] additional value.
[2624.82 → 2626.22] We saw a feature that
[2626.22 → 2627.38] was broken and sucked.
[2627.64 → 2628.30] Merch messages,
[2628.60 → 2629.56] which don't show up in
[2629.56 → 2630.72] our dashboard properly.
[2630.94 → 2631.76] And we went,
[2632.06 → 2632.58] hey,
[2632.86 → 2633.86] that's stupid.
[2634.42 → 2634.62] Uh,
[2634.96 → 2635.80] look at this.
[2636.00 → 2636.34] Here's a
[2636.42 → 2637.12] here's two merch,
[2637.28 → 2637.62] sorry,
[2637.68 → 2638.12] did I say merch
[2638.12 → 2638.40] messages?
[2638.90 → 2639.92] Here's two super
[2639.92 → 2640.36] chats.
[2640.56 → 2640.76] Okay?
[2640.94 → 2641.68] Here's two super
[2641.68 → 2642.00] chats.
[2642.20 → 2642.50] Oh,
[2642.54 → 2642.80] good.
[2643.10 → 2644.28] One of them is here.
[2644.44 → 2645.34] What happened to the
[2645.34 → 2645.78] other ones?
[2645.92 → 2647.22] I don't fucking know.
[2647.74 → 2648.92] Nobody fucking knows.
[2649.28 → 2649.82] It's gone.
[2650.34 → 2651.26] So we saw something
[2651.26 → 2651.68] that was broken.
[2651.78 → 2652.06] Also,
[2652.18 → 2652.54] by the way,
[2652.62 → 2653.14] why are you just
[2653.14 → 2653.96] giving Google money
[2653.96 → 2654.66] to build features
[2654.66 → 2655.28] that don't work
[2655.28 → 2655.70] properly?
[2656.48 → 2657.68] That has been broken
[2657.68 → 2658.76] for two years.
[2660.40 → 2660.84] Unbelievable.
[2662.12 → 2662.52] Unacceptable.
[2663.56 → 2664.24] Merch messages,
[2664.70 → 2664.96] man,
[2665.76 → 2666.34] how long did it
[2666.34 → 2666.58] take?
[2667.18 → 2667.60] I'd like,
[2667.68 → 2667.86] I'm,
[2667.88 → 2668.46] I'm pretty sure
[2668.46 → 2669.30] the first iteration
[2669.30 → 2670.06] of merch messages
[2670.06 → 2670.54] was ready
[2670.54 → 2671.48] in less than a week.
[2671.88 → 2672.88] It was amazing.
[2673.24 → 2673.46] Okay?
[2673.60 → 2674.84] And what's best
[2674.84 → 2675.64] is that instead
[2675.64 → 2676.58] of giving Google
[2676.58 → 2677.96] a big cut of the money
[2677.96 → 2678.94] that you send to us,
[2679.32 → 2680.10] you actually get
[2680.10 → 2680.92] to give it to
[2680.92 → 2682.10] people like,
[2682.16 → 2682.30] well,
[2682.36 → 2682.70] it used to be
[2682.70 → 2683.32] our t-shirt printer,
[2683.44 → 2683.76] but anyway,
[2684.02 → 2684.68] you get to give it
[2684.68 → 2685.70] to people like
[2685.70 → 2686.48] Omega Pro
[2686.48 → 2687.60] and PH Moulds
[2687.60 → 2688.34] and the companies
[2688.34 → 2688.98] that we work with
[2688.98 → 2689.56] on the screwdriver.
[2689.94 → 2690.72] You get to give it
[2690.72 → 2691.32] to our,
[2691.32 → 2692.46] our creator warehouse
[2692.46 → 2693.32] team who gets
[2693.32 → 2694.24] paid out of that money.
[2694.44 → 2695.50] You get to actually
[2695.50 → 2696.22] get something
[2696.22 → 2697.04] in the mail,
[2697.24 → 2697.64] right?
[2697.74 → 2698.24] You don't just
[2698.24 → 2699.32] give that money away.
[2699.68 → 2700.40] You give it to people
[2700.40 → 2701.00] who are actually
[2701.00 → 2702.40] making real things
[2702.40 → 2702.90] that you might
[2702.90 → 2703.94] actually want to have,
[2703.94 → 2704.74] like a really nice
[2704.74 → 2705.96] insulated water bottle.
[2706.06 → 2706.48] It's better.
[2707.10 → 2707.36] So,
[2708.28 → 2709.12] so merch messages
[2709.12 → 2709.78] were developed
[2709.78 → 2710.40] so that you guys
[2710.40 → 2711.38] can interact with the show
[2711.38 → 2711.98] in a way that is
[2711.98 → 2713.00] better for everyone.
[2713.54 → 2714.38] Does it cost money?
[2714.72 → 2715.06] Yeah.
[2715.88 → 2717.14] But we have received
[2717.14 → 2718.74] like zero pushback
[2718.74 → 2719.52] on merch messages.
[2719.88 → 2720.88] Some people complained
[2720.88 → 2721.30] we were doing
[2721.30 → 2722.02] too many of them,
[2722.02 → 2723.34] but then for every person
[2723.34 → 2723.76] who complained
[2723.76 → 2724.12] we were doing
[2724.12 → 2724.80] too many of them,
[2725.08 → 2725.68] there was at least
[2725.68 → 2726.60] three people saying
[2726.60 → 2727.42] merch messages
[2727.42 → 2728.12] are my favourite
[2728.12 → 2728.84] because it's basically
[2728.84 → 2729.60] Q&A time.
[2729.96 → 2731.08] So our response to that
[2731.08 → 2732.26] was we do a couple
[2732.26 → 2732.88] of them early on
[2732.88 → 2733.30] in the show
[2733.30 → 2734.18] so I can talk about
[2734.18 → 2734.80] how to spend a
[2734.80 → 2736.12] how to spend a merch message.
[2736.80 → 2737.48] Freudian slip,
[2737.56 → 2737.84] love it.
[2738.18 → 2739.22] How to send a merch message.
[2739.44 → 2740.66] You go on lttstore.com,
[2740.72 → 2741.34] you pick up something,
[2741.42 → 2742.16] doesn't matter if you're not,
[2742.50 → 2742.68] you know,
[2742.70 → 2743.48] if we don't have anything
[2743.48 → 2744.34] fresh and new
[2744.34 → 2745.00] that interests you,
[2745.06 → 2745.62] you can always just
[2745.62 → 2746.40] pick up a gift card.
[2746.84 → 2746.98] Okay,
[2747.00 → 2747.78] you can spend it later.
[2748.02 → 2749.08] So you go on lttstore.com
[2749.08 → 2749.58] in the checkout,
[2749.58 → 2750.26] you'll see a place
[2750.26 → 2751.24] to leave a merch message.
[2751.36 → 2752.86] It goes to our producer Dan.
[2753.60 → 2754.48] Sup producer Dan.
[2755.78 → 2757.42] He will either respond to you,
[2757.50 → 2758.34] he'll just show your message
[2758.34 → 2758.82] if you're just like,
[2758.88 → 2759.68] hey mom or whatever,
[2759.78 → 2760.96] happy birthday to a friend
[2760.96 → 2761.30] or whatever,
[2761.38 → 2762.04] you can just have it
[2762.04 → 2762.92] show up down there
[2762.92 → 2764.58] or sometimes he'll curate them
[2764.58 → 2765.90] so that Luke and I
[2765.90 → 2766.78] can check them out later
[2766.78 → 2770.04] and if we don't get to it,
[2770.14 → 2770.68] well, hey,
[2770.92 → 2771.68] at least you get your order
[2771.68 → 2772.04] in the mail.
[2772.28 → 2772.70] Heck yeah.
[2774.24 → 2774.56] Anywho,
[2774.70 → 2775.84] let's do a couple of them now
[2775.84 → 2776.68] and then we'll,
[2776.78 → 2776.88] right,
[2776.96 → 2777.52] so I was going to say
[2777.52 → 2778.18] our compromise
[2778.18 → 2779.16] was we do a couple of them
[2779.16 → 2779.68] early in the show.
[2779.74 → 2780.76] We talk about how to send them
[2780.76 → 2782.48] and then we address
[2782.48 → 2783.04] the rest of them
[2783.04 → 2783.76] sort of more towards
[2783.76 → 2784.40] the end of the show
[2784.40 → 2785.30] when it devolves
[2785.30 → 2786.68] into absolute chaos.
[2787.18 → 2787.52] Dan,
[2787.58 → 2788.12] hit me with a couple
[2788.12 → 2788.70] merch messages.
[2788.82 → 2789.18] Let's go.
[2789.32 → 2789.50] Okay,
[2789.54 → 2789.96] I've got one here
[2789.96 → 2790.72] from Vincent.
[2791.18 → 2792.26] So Linus,
[2792.40 → 2793.22] out of Nvidia,
[2793.80 → 2794.74] Intel and AMD,
[2794.92 → 2795.40] who's overall
[2795.40 → 2796.28] the biggest liar
[2796.28 → 2797.36] and out of those,
[2797.46 → 2798.10] which lie
[2798.10 → 2798.66] was the most
[2798.66 → 2799.96] personally offensive?
[2801.50 → 2802.58] Why did you ask this
[2802.58 → 2803.92] on the Spicy WAN show?
[2804.56 → 2805.58] Corporations is a liar
[2805.58 → 2806.18] sometimes,
[2806.28 → 2806.44] right?
[2807.94 → 2808.30] Wow.
[2808.30 → 2810.42] you specifically
[2810.42 → 2811.14] called out
[2811.14 → 2811.72] Intel,
[2811.92 → 2812.36] AMD,
[2812.68 → 2813.76] and Nvidia.
[2814.28 → 2814.64] Now,
[2814.82 → 2816.28] here's the thing.
[2817.20 → 2817.68] Companies
[2817.68 → 2818.88] are made up
[2818.88 → 2819.54] of departments,
[2820.26 → 2821.32] which are made up of,
[2821.32 → 2821.48] well,
[2821.58 → 2821.72] okay,
[2821.82 → 2821.98] no,
[2822.12 → 2822.50] hold on.
[2822.82 → 2824.44] Companies are made up
[2824.44 → 2825.68] of business units,
[2825.90 → 2826.80] which are made up
[2826.80 → 2827.50] of departments,
[2827.88 → 2828.88] which are made up
[2828.88 → 2829.54] of teams,
[2829.82 → 2830.52] which are made up
[2830.52 → 2831.08] of people.
[2831.08 → 2831.58] people.
[2832.12 → 2832.56] So,
[2833.06 → 2834.42] if I was to,
[2834.42 → 2836.14] if I was to zero in
[2836.14 → 2838.24] on an egregious lie,
[2838.92 → 2840.04] I mean,
[2840.10 → 2840.66] I could pick,
[2840.70 → 2841.68] I could pick anyone
[2841.68 → 2842.26] of them.
[2842.58 → 2842.88] Man,
[2843.52 → 2845.34] I just about pulled
[2845.34 → 2846.28] an all-nighter,
[2846.64 → 2846.90] okay,
[2847.08 → 2848.66] when AMD's bulldozer
[2848.66 → 2849.82] processors came out,
[2849.98 → 2852.50] because our AMD rep
[2852.50 → 2854.04] at the time told me
[2854.04 → 2855.32] they were freaking
[2855.32 → 2855.90] awesome.
[2856.14 → 2856.28] Sorry,
[2856.38 → 2856.76] excuse me,
[2856.96 → 2857.90] fucking awesome.
[2857.90 → 2859.06] He was like,
[2859.26 → 2859.52] man,
[2860.20 → 2861.38] these CPUs slap
[2861.38 → 2861.94] bitches harder
[2861.94 → 2862.72] than Dana White.
[2863.92 → 2864.40] Oh,
[2864.74 → 2865.02] God.
[2870.36 → 2870.84] Sorry,
[2870.90 → 2871.34] I'm trying to get
[2871.34 → 2871.92] into character,
[2872.08 → 2872.30] okay?
[2872.96 → 2873.62] You're going to kill
[2873.62 → 2874.32] the pair of us.
[2878.26 → 2878.74] Anyway,
[2879.82 → 2881.02] he tells me,
[2881.02 → 2881.14] he tells me,
[2881.14 → 2881.46] he,
[2881.46 → 2881.54] he,
[2881.54 → 2882.14] he,
[2882.14 → 2883.14] he,
[2883.14 → 2883.46] he,
[2883.46 → 2884.14] he,
[2884.14 → 2885.14] he,
[2885.14 → 2886.14] he,
[2886.14 → 2887.14] he,
[2887.14 → 2887.40] he,
[2887.40 → 2887.88] he,
[2887.88 → 2889.16] get it together,
[2889.26 → 2889.44] Luke.
[2891.52 → 2892.00] Anyway,
[2892.18 → 2893.10] he tells me
[2893.10 → 2894.92] that the CPU's amazing.
[2895.22 → 2896.18] At the time,
[2896.26 → 2896.46] right,
[2896.72 → 2897.30] I am,
[2897.44 → 2898.52] I am ghostwriting
[2898.52 → 2899.62] for Hardware Canucks,
[2899.70 → 2900.20] which was owned
[2900.20 → 2900.98] by NCI,
[2901.38 → 2902.82] and I'm working on,
[2902.88 → 2903.10] like,
[2903.28 → 2904.28] our launch day,
[2904.48 → 2904.88] you know,
[2905.00 → 2905.32] coverage.
[2905.42 → 2906.36] I'm trying to overclock
[2906.36 → 2906.88] it or whatever,
[2907.30 → 2908.38] and I'm sitting here,
[2908.48 → 2909.40] I'm benchmarking,
[2909.80 → 2910.82] late into the night,
[2910.90 → 2911.04] going,
[2911.12 → 2912.28] this thing's a piece of shit,
[2912.84 → 2914.38] but I was told it's great,
[2914.62 → 2915.78] but it's the middle of the night,
[2916.16 → 2916.38] right,
[2916.52 → 2917.58] the night before the embargo,
[2917.58 → 2918.56] because I only got it,
[2918.56 → 2918.72] like,
[2918.78 → 2919.42] that day,
[2920.10 → 2922.54] and I'm sitting here going,
[2922.68 → 2924.78] everyone else is going to make me look like an idiot.
[2925.00 → 2926.34] I can't publish these numbers.
[2926.60 → 2927.86] This thing is dog slow.
[2928.80 → 2930.00] And then it comes out,
[2930.36 → 2930.96] and it's like,
[2931.00 → 2931.62] it sucks.
[2931.98 → 2932.74] And I'm sitting here going,
[2932.90 → 2933.04] well,
[2933.10 → 2934.46] that would have been great to know.
[2936.84 → 2937.20] But,
[2937.48 → 2938.32] I mean,
[2939.22 → 2939.48] okay,
[2939.54 → 2940.30] I was about to say,
[2940.50 → 2941.64] that's not AMD's fault.
[2942.34 → 2946.68] AMD does have a culture of overhyping crap products that,
[2946.68 → 2947.66] that suck.
[2948.94 → 2951.20] It's usually closer to,
[2951.30 → 2951.58] you know,
[2951.64 → 2952.40] white lies,
[2952.52 → 2953.00] I guess,
[2953.56 → 2953.76] or,
[2953.90 → 2955.12] I don't know if they're white lies.
[2955.30 → 2957.40] It's usually closer to bending the truth.
[2958.28 → 2958.60] I get,
[2958.72 → 2958.88] hmm,
[2959.04 → 2959.46] is it?
[2960.32 → 2961.16] AMD lies.
[2961.40 → 2961.66] Okay.
[2962.00 → 2962.74] Intel lies,
[2963.08 → 2963.36] lots.
[2964.90 → 2965.34] Nvidia,
[2965.88 → 2968.32] Nvidia is just a bunch of insidious fucks.
[2968.32 → 2969.24] like,
[2969.68 → 2970.64] let's face it,
[2970.70 → 2970.88] they,
[2970.96 → 2973.16] they have a culture of being insidious fucks.
[2973.74 → 2974.14] Um,
[2974.60 → 2975.64] and don't kid yourself,
[2976.08 → 2976.30] you know,
[2976.38 → 2977.04] just because,
[2977.10 → 2978.70] just because Intel dresses nicer,
[2978.70 → 2980.12] and is more respectful to you,
[2980.18 → 2980.54] doesn't mean,
[2980.64 → 2981.54] these are businesses,
[2981.74 → 2981.94] right?
[2982.10 → 2984.64] They exist to separate you from your money.
[2985.92 → 2986.40] However,
[2986.86 → 2988.20] there are people there.
[2988.62 → 2989.24] I want to,
[2989.28 → 2991.26] I want to go back to the other side of this coin.
[2991.60 → 2992.70] Whether it's Nvidia,
[2993.00 → 2994.00] or whether it's Intel,
[2994.14 → 2995.14] or whether it's AMD,
[2995.62 → 2997.92] I have met some of the most genuine,
[2998.50 → 2999.00] passionate,
[2999.40 → 3002.12] enthusiastic people that I've ever encountered in the industry.
[3002.48 → 3002.84] Because,
[3003.20 → 3004.50] all of these companies,
[3004.96 → 3006.40] insidious fucks that they are,
[3006.86 → 3007.60] are profitable,
[3008.06 → 3010.44] which allows them to spend lots of money
[3010.44 → 3012.18] to attract super passionate,
[3012.56 → 3014.02] super-intelligent people
[3014.02 → 3015.32] to work on their products.
[3016.16 → 3016.72] So,
[3016.90 → 3018.14] what I'm trying to say,
[3018.46 → 3020.74] is that corporations is a liar sometimes,
[3020.90 → 3021.48] absolutely,
[3021.48 → 3025.04] but corporations is actually also full of enthusiastic,
[3025.54 → 3026.10] amazing,
[3026.46 → 3027.30] highly intelligent,
[3027.80 → 3028.20] honest,
[3028.48 → 3029.52] people,
[3030.12 → 3030.38] right?
[3030.58 → 3030.86] Like,
[3030.92 → 3034.66] I remember running into one of the people that advocated for us,
[3034.84 → 3036.44] for Skull Trail at Intel,
[3036.98 → 3037.74] and he was just like,
[3037.80 → 3037.92] yeah,
[3037.98 → 3039.38] that was like my passion project.
[3039.46 → 3039.82] I was like,
[3040.34 → 3041.14] you're awesome!
[3042.32 → 3043.36] That was so cool!
[3043.44 → 3044.16] It was basically,
[3044.48 → 3045.82] Intel's server platform,
[3046.10 → 3047.24] in gamers clothing,
[3047.42 → 3048.40] and overclockable,
[3048.50 → 3049.10] at the time,
[3049.16 → 3049.30] right?
[3049.34 → 3050.12] It was awesome!
[3050.84 → 3051.46] Bleeding edge,
[3051.48 → 3053.14] made no commercial sense,
[3053.20 → 3053.90] but they did it,
[3053.98 → 3054.18] right?
[3054.82 → 3055.14] You know,
[3055.22 → 3057.30] and it's the same thing for companies like NVIDIA.
[3057.42 → 3057.68] Man,
[3058.10 → 3060.26] man does NVIDIA ever have great engineers!
[3060.90 → 3061.04] Like,
[3061.10 → 3062.92] these are people that are just so smart,
[3063.02 → 3065.34] that you sit down and talk to them for like 15 minutes,
[3065.46 → 3065.64] like,
[3066.54 → 3067.46] holy shit!
[3067.54 → 3069.38] I could have gone to school for a year,
[3069.42 → 3072.14] and I wouldn't have learned half as much as I did just now,
[3072.50 → 3072.74] right?
[3072.74 → 3075.32] And so when I say these companies are just like,
[3075.32 → 3078.20] full of liars and deceivers,
[3078.46 → 3079.06] it's true!
[3079.42 → 3082.50] But these companies are also full of honest,
[3082.70 → 3083.36] amazing,
[3083.66 → 3084.40] passionate people,
[3084.52 → 3086.72] who would do it for zero dollars!
[3087.08 → 3087.66] So what?
[3087.72 → 3088.38] They're making money!
[3088.46 → 3088.96] That's great!
[3089.04 → 3089.46] They should!
[3089.84 → 3091.10] But they would have done it anyway,
[3091.26 → 3092.04] which is amazing!
[3092.12 → 3093.16] You have to love that passion,
[3093.24 → 3093.42] right?
[3094.14 → 3094.62] Um,
[3094.62 → 3096.86] you know what?
[3096.92 → 3098.28] Let's have a spicy WAN show.
[3098.60 → 3100.18] It's not one of those companies,
[3100.78 → 3101.20] but
[3101.20 → 3103.60] the closest that I would say
[3103.60 → 3104.54] that I've been
[3104.54 → 3105.52] to being
[3105.52 → 3108.08] lied to outright
[3108.08 → 3109.72] by a company,
[3110.28 → 3110.66] um,
[3110.98 → 3113.00] I would say this is fair to say
[3113.00 → 3115.08] because it was directly from the CEO,
[3115.72 → 3118.16] and it was a direct deception,
[3118.76 → 3119.02] uh,
[3119.02 → 3121.68] something that they would have had intimate knowledge of.
[3121.96 → 3122.16] Uh,
[3122.16 → 3124.02] this was around a key product launch.
[3124.02 → 3125.22] It wasn't from,
[3125.36 → 3125.52] you know,
[3125.58 → 3126.82] a low-level sales rep
[3126.82 → 3127.84] or marketing rep,
[3127.92 → 3129.68] or even a high-level sales rep
[3129.68 → 3130.38] or marketing rep.
[3130.44 → 3131.80] This was directly from the CEO,
[3132.08 → 3133.34] and I was told
[3133.34 → 3134.40] from Racer,
[3134.80 → 3135.12] okay,
[3135.96 → 3137.76] that their gaming switches,
[3138.16 → 3140.26] back when they first released Racer switches,
[3140.68 → 3141.60] were not
[3141.60 → 3143.12] rebadged
[3143.12 → 3144.26] Taiwan
[3144.26 → 3145.94] Cherry Knock off switches.
[3146.10 → 3146.86] I was told
[3146.86 → 3148.78] that they were Racer switches
[3148.78 → 3150.86] inside and out
[3150.86 → 3152.48] engineered by Racer.
[3152.80 → 3153.70] And that
[3153.70 → 3155.02] was at
[3155.02 → 3156.08] best,
[3156.70 → 3157.62] at
[3157.62 → 3158.64] best,
[3158.86 → 3160.24] a misrepresentation.
[3160.62 → 3162.30] At the very best.
[3164.88 → 3165.64] Because
[3165.64 → 3168.16] they were
[3168.16 → 3169.14] Taiwan Cherry clones.
[3170.98 → 3171.80] Moving
[3171.80 → 3173.86] the actuation point,
[3174.20 → 3175.52] 0.2 of a millimetre,
[3175.90 → 3176.56] is not
[3176.56 → 3178.08] engineering a switch.
[3178.84 → 3179.08] Okay?
[3179.08 → 3180.28] The Roamer G
[3180.28 → 3181.74] is engineering
[3181.74 → 3182.86] a fucking switch.
[3183.10 → 3184.20] And you can say what you want
[3184.20 → 3185.40] about the Roamer G switch.
[3185.74 → 3185.92] Okay?
[3186.72 → 3188.10] But that switch was
[3188.10 → 3188.76] engineered
[3188.76 → 3190.24] by Common
[3190.24 → 3191.64] with input
[3191.64 → 3192.48] from Logitech.
[3193.18 → 3194.72] The Racer gaming switch
[3194.72 → 3195.88] was not
[3195.88 → 3196.46] engineered
[3196.46 → 3197.20] by Racer.
[3197.88 → 3198.76] It involved
[3198.76 → 3199.24] engineering.
[3200.00 → 3201.06] You'd be amazed
[3201.06 → 3201.70] how hard it is
[3201.70 → 3202.40] to build a screwdriver.
[3202.40 → 3203.40] And if it's hard
[3203.40 → 3204.04] to build a screwdriver,
[3204.50 → 3205.28] I promise you,
[3205.40 → 3206.40] it's hard to build
[3206.40 → 3207.34] a keyboard switch.
[3208.18 → 3209.76] It's a complex mechanism.
[3210.14 → 3210.94] It's small.
[3211.26 → 3211.94] The cost
[3211.94 → 3213.30] needs to be low.
[3213.54 → 3214.46] It must be low.
[3214.78 → 3215.60] It can't be a dollar
[3215.60 → 3216.10] a switch.
[3216.58 → 3216.70] Like,
[3216.80 → 3217.62] you can't,
[3217.72 → 3217.98] I mean,
[3218.02 → 3218.50] you can sell
[3218.50 → 3219.44] $300 keyboards,
[3219.78 → 3220.78] but most people
[3220.78 → 3221.44] will not buy
[3221.44 → 3222.42] a $300 keyboard.
[3222.54 → 3223.16] There's a limit.
[3223.40 → 3223.66] Okay?
[3224.06 → 3224.90] And it's got to be
[3224.90 → 3226.10] reliable within that limit.
[3226.54 → 3227.70] The millions of times
[3227.70 → 3228.36] you have to be able
[3228.36 → 3228.80] to press it.
[3228.80 → 3229.20] I get it.
[3229.24 → 3230.38] There was engineering involved,
[3230.60 → 3232.02] but you did not
[3232.02 → 3233.48] engineer a switch.
[3234.34 → 3235.60] A Racer gaming switch,
[3235.90 → 3236.76] at least back then,
[3236.82 → 3236.96] right?
[3237.06 → 3237.22] Okay?
[3237.28 → 3237.84] So this is like
[3237.84 → 3239.28] seven,
[3239.36 → 3239.84] eight years ago,
[3239.86 → 3240.04] right?
[3240.24 → 3241.22] At least back then,
[3241.32 → 3242.32] it was a cherry clone.
[3243.28 → 3243.84] That's it.
[3244.38 → 3245.22] I love that.
[3245.42 → 3245.66] This is,
[3245.70 → 3245.82] yeah,
[3245.86 → 3246.26] this is great.
[3247.18 → 3247.50] DBOS2289
[3247.50 → 3248.38] float plane says,
[3248.72 → 3249.48] Linus is going to,
[3249.56 → 3250.48] wants to be spicy today
[3250.48 → 3251.14] and Luke doesn't have
[3251.14 → 3252.16] any power to stop him
[3252.16 → 3252.60] this time.
[3255.74 → 3256.10] Yeah,
[3256.20 → 3256.52] yeah,
[3256.58 → 3256.90] he could,
[3256.98 → 3257.22] okay,
[3257.30 → 3258.08] he could pull the mic.
[3258.80 → 3259.76] Get the fuck out of here.
[3261.92 → 3262.50] So there,
[3263.04 → 3263.98] I think that's the
[3263.98 → 3264.94] I think that's the closest
[3264.94 → 3267.04] I've ever been to just like,
[3267.64 → 3268.72] or I think that's the most
[3268.72 → 3270.58] egregiously I have ever been
[3270.58 → 3272.34] misled by a company.
[3273.28 → 3274.34] And to be clear,
[3274.46 → 3275.32] I'm not counting,
[3275.58 → 3277.20] I'm not counting anything
[3277.20 → 3277.98] that was unintentional.
[3278.86 → 3279.06] You know,
[3279.52 → 3280.60] like even if you,
[3280.72 → 3281.66] if you go back and look at
[3281.66 → 3282.84] like the principled technology
[3282.84 → 3283.78] scandal at Intel,
[3283.98 → 3285.62] I had a theory back,
[3285.74 → 3287.02] back during that time
[3287.02 → 3288.28] that no one would ever
[3288.28 → 3289.02] go on the record
[3289.02 → 3289.98] and talk to me about.
[3290.56 → 3290.96] But,
[3291.36 → 3292.68] I'll say that my theory
[3292.68 → 3293.98] is basically there,
[3294.12 → 3295.74] there were ignorant executives
[3295.74 → 3297.52] and their egos involved.
[3298.02 → 3299.90] There was skilled people
[3299.90 → 3301.78] who didn't have the time
[3301.78 → 3303.74] or chance to review things
[3303.74 → 3304.88] involved.
[3304.88 → 3306.04] basically,
[3307.14 → 3307.88] bottom line,
[3308.02 → 3309.20] don't attribute to malice
[3309.20 → 3310.12] what you can attribute
[3310.12 → 3310.96] to incompetence
[3310.96 → 3311.38] or whatever,
[3311.50 → 3312.52] whatever the quote was.
[3312.80 → 3314.00] I suspect that that was
[3314.00 → 3315.80] a clown show comedy of errors,
[3316.18 → 3317.26] not a
[3317.26 → 3318.54] a wilful attempt
[3318.54 → 3320.34] to deceive the enthusiast community
[3320.34 → 3321.08] who are the only people
[3321.08 → 3322.06] watching those stupid
[3322.06 → 3323.08] presentations anyway
[3323.08 → 3324.54] and who were obviously
[3324.54 → 3325.54] going to catch that.
[3327.88 → 3328.54] You know,
[3328.60 → 3329.14] that's,
[3329.14 → 3332.78] that I don't,
[3332.78 → 3334.74] I don't classify the same way.
[3334.92 → 3335.34] I just,
[3335.44 → 3336.38] I just don't.
[3336.46 → 3337.58] Whereas when you tell me,
[3337.70 → 3337.80] yeah,
[3337.82 → 3339.16] we built this thing from scratch
[3339.16 → 3340.60] and you like actually didn't,
[3340.78 → 3341.22] that's,
[3341.34 → 3342.74] that's different.
[3346.62 → 3347.80] Hit me with another one.
[3349.96 → 3350.36] Okay,
[3350.42 → 3350.56] yeah,
[3350.56 → 3351.34] sorry about the delay there.
[3351.40 → 3352.94] I've got one here from,
[3354.52 → 3355.10] um,
[3355.22 → 3355.52] well,
[3355.60 → 3356.48] we'll do this one from,
[3357.58 → 3357.86] oh,
[3357.92 → 3358.08] Geez,
[3358.12 → 3358.46] I don't know.
[3359.14 → 3360.10] How about from Reed?
[3360.72 → 3361.12] Uh,
[3361.16 → 3361.36] no,
[3361.44 → 3362.66] I want to save LTX for later.
[3363.42 → 3363.68] Cody,
[3363.88 → 3364.20] uh,
[3364.20 → 3364.72] love the products.
[3364.84 → 3364.98] Guys,
[3365.10 → 3366.12] I was wondering if you have any
[3366.12 → 3366.64] IPB,
[3366.78 → 3368.94] IPV4 address space
[3368.94 → 3370.48] and use BGP for anything
[3370.48 → 3371.72] and if you guys would ever
[3371.72 → 3372.80] consider making a video
[3372.80 → 3373.94] about how all that works.
[3374.34 → 3375.08] Keep up the good work.
[3375.14 → 3375.68] Love you guys.
[3376.16 → 3376.44] Uh,
[3376.50 → 3376.90] that's a
[3376.94 → 3377.46] that's a no.
[3378.82 → 3379.60] I mean,
[3380.52 → 3381.12] yeah,
[3381.32 → 3381.56] we,
[3381.64 → 3383.30] we definitely have a small block
[3383.30 → 3384.50] of IPV4 addresses
[3384.50 → 3385.86] but like,
[3386.26 → 3386.88] we're not,
[3386.96 → 3388.18] we're not like hoarding them
[3388.18 → 3388.60] or anything.
[3388.60 → 3389.40] We,
[3389.60 → 3390.18] you know,
[3390.66 → 3390.94] yeah,
[3391.32 → 3391.50] I,
[3391.62 → 3392.10] we just,
[3392.30 → 3392.52] we,
[3392.66 → 3392.86] we,
[3392.86 → 3393.60] we just have them.
[3393.78 → 3394.38] They're useful.
[3394.94 → 3395.34] Oh,
[3395.40 → 3396.64] we have a fair number?
[3397.10 → 3397.34] Oh,
[3397.42 → 3397.68] okay,
[3397.78 → 3397.96] cool.
[3399.02 → 3399.94] We should sell them.
[3401.06 → 3401.42] All right,
[3401.52 → 3401.76] cool.
[3402.60 → 3402.84] Sure.
[3403.06 → 3404.00] Luke wants to hold on to them.
[3404.22 → 3404.54] One more?
[3405.90 → 3406.18] Yeah,
[3406.28 → 3406.44] sure,
[3406.50 → 3406.94] give me one more.
[3407.30 → 3407.66] Um,
[3407.76 → 3408.50] got one here from Eric.
[3408.88 → 3409.44] Jay and Bob,
[3409.66 → 3410.76] I've been feeling a ton
[3410.76 → 3412.36] of burnout at work lately
[3412.36 → 3413.06] and I'm considering
[3413.06 → 3414.04] changing career paths.
[3414.04 → 3415.00] My question is,
[3415.40 → 3416.42] do you have any advice
[3416.42 → 3417.56] regarding when to go
[3417.56 → 3418.26] to the higher ups
[3418.26 → 3419.46] and complain about issues
[3419.46 → 3420.34] and when to know
[3420.34 → 3421.12] they aren't listening
[3421.12 → 3422.78] and you just must move on?
[3423.20 → 3423.76] Oh man,
[3423.82 → 3424.68] that's a good question.
[3425.24 → 3425.62] Um,
[3425.94 → 3426.28] well,
[3426.42 → 3427.64] one thing that I will say
[3427.64 → 3428.20] as,
[3428.38 → 3428.92] as a
[3429.02 → 3429.68] as an employer
[3429.68 → 3430.68] is,
[3430.68 → 3432.62] I really,
[3433.24 → 3433.54] man,
[3433.58 → 3434.12] and this is gonna,
[3434.52 → 3435.48] this kind of ties back
[3435.48 → 3436.32] into a conversation
[3436.32 → 3437.32] we were having recently
[3437.32 → 3439.24] about how I really respect
[3439.24 → 3440.16] people who,
[3440.28 → 3441.26] who want to better themselves,
[3441.48 → 3442.30] who want feedback
[3442.30 → 3444.26] and I find the legal framework
[3444.26 → 3445.04] around employment
[3445.04 → 3445.78] here in BC
[3445.78 → 3446.66] very frustrating
[3446.66 → 3448.02] because it prevents me
[3448.02 → 3449.10] without opening myself
[3449.10 → 3449.82] up to liability
[3449.82 → 3451.82] from providing feedback
[3451.82 → 3452.40] to people
[3452.40 → 3454.22] who are being let go.
[3454.60 → 3454.76] You know,
[3454.84 → 3454.96] hey,
[3455.02 → 3455.66] here's how you could
[3455.66 → 3456.62] probably make it got better
[3456.62 → 3457.08] next time.
[3457.16 → 3457.24] I,
[3457.24 → 3458.20] I just can't do it.
[3458.72 → 3459.08] Um,
[3459.08 → 3460.92] and so,
[3461.26 → 3461.68] you know,
[3462.36 → 3463.56] as much as it's,
[3463.56 → 3463.92] like,
[3464.14 → 3464.60] sucks,
[3465.12 → 3465.62] um,
[3465.66 → 3466.12] that it's,
[3466.12 → 3466.36] like,
[3466.42 → 3467.10] a double standard,
[3467.16 → 3467.54] I guess,
[3467.92 → 3469.96] is what I would say
[3469.96 → 3470.74] as an employer
[3470.74 → 3472.56] is please talk to me,
[3473.14 → 3473.40] right?
[3473.52 → 3474.86] Give me a chance
[3474.86 → 3475.48] if there's something
[3475.48 → 3476.62] that's making you unhappy.
[3476.88 → 3479.20] The absolute last thing
[3479.20 → 3480.22] in the world
[3480.22 → 3481.18] that I want
[3481.18 → 3482.48] is for you to just
[3482.48 → 3485.24] quietly sit there
[3485.24 → 3486.08] and fester
[3486.08 → 3487.26] on your unhappiness
[3487.26 → 3488.74] and be miserable
[3488.74 → 3490.00] and resentful
[3490.00 → 3490.68] when,
[3490.86 → 3491.06] like,
[3491.44 → 3491.94] honestly,
[3492.42 → 3493.28] maybe it's something
[3493.28 → 3494.22] that we could have
[3494.22 → 3494.84] just fixed
[3494.84 → 3495.98] and maybe it might,
[3496.16 → 3496.74] maybe it wouldn't
[3496.74 → 3497.42] happen overnight.
[3497.80 → 3498.30] Like,
[3498.38 → 3499.06] for example,
[3499.44 → 3499.86] um,
[3500.18 → 3501.26] we didn't have
[3501.26 → 3501.72] an employee
[3501.72 → 3503.06] retirement savings plan
[3503.06 → 3504.50] until very recently.
[3504.80 → 3505.16] Uh,
[3505.16 → 3505.58] that's something
[3505.58 → 3506.16] that we added.
[3506.34 → 3507.16] I think we've got
[3507.16 → 3508.60] a pretty kick-ass plan now.
[3508.74 → 3509.26] It's,
[3509.36 → 3509.52] like,
[3510.02 → 3511.02] very competitive.
[3511.64 → 3512.12] Um,
[3512.24 → 3512.78] but we,
[3512.82 → 3514.10] we didn't have one before.
[3514.36 → 3514.82] Why?
[3515.02 → 3515.16] Well,
[3515.16 → 3516.20] because there's a lot
[3516.20 → 3517.22] of administrative overhead.
[3517.66 → 3517.92] Uh,
[3517.92 → 3519.40] it's a significant cost
[3519.40 → 3520.10] and,
[3520.22 → 3520.40] I mean,
[3520.50 → 3520.64] well,
[3520.64 → 3520.78] yeah,
[3520.84 → 3521.24] that's why.
[3521.38 → 3521.76] Basically,
[3521.96 → 3522.18] there's,
[3522.60 → 3524.04] and as we've grown
[3524.04 → 3525.38] and as we've become
[3525.38 → 3526.60] more profitable
[3526.60 → 3527.62] and as we've added
[3527.62 → 3528.76] more people
[3528.76 → 3529.76] and as we're looking
[3529.76 → 3530.90] for ways to continue
[3530.90 → 3531.38] to grow
[3531.38 → 3532.04] and become,
[3532.04 → 3532.66] uh,
[3532.66 → 3533.66] a better place to work,
[3533.72 → 3533.86] like,
[3533.94 → 3534.48] my whole thing,
[3534.54 → 3534.68] right,
[3534.72 → 3535.74] has been since day one
[3535.74 → 3536.28] and I've always,
[3536.38 → 3537.24] I've always done the voice,
[3537.30 → 3538.08] so I'll do the voice again.
[3538.14 → 3539.12] I want to be a real company,
[3539.52 → 3539.74] right?
[3540.58 → 3540.88] Is,
[3541.08 → 3541.64] how do we,
[3541.72 → 3542.74] how do we keep improving?
[3543.68 → 3544.48] What if,
[3544.90 → 3546.18] what if you were upset
[3546.18 → 3547.32] and resentful
[3547.32 → 3548.30] and the thing
[3548.30 → 3550.02] that you were so upset about
[3550.02 → 3551.38] was something that,
[3551.46 → 3551.66] like,
[3552.14 → 3553.48] we were two months
[3553.48 → 3554.04] from announcing
[3554.04 → 3555.42] and you up and quit
[3555.42 → 3556.38] and that would have been,
[3556.44 → 3557.04] that would have been it
[3557.04 → 3557.94] and you would have been happy
[3557.94 → 3559.64] or what if it's something
[3559.64 → 3560.04] that,
[3560.10 → 3560.30] you know,
[3560.40 → 3561.28] I had been sitting there
[3561.28 → 3561.76] going like,
[3562.34 → 3562.58] oh,
[3562.64 → 3562.94] man,
[3563.28 → 3565.70] I really want to do this
[3565.70 → 3565.90] but,
[3565.98 → 3566.16] like,
[3566.24 → 3566.78] I don't even know
[3566.78 → 3567.40] how much appetite
[3567.40 → 3568.46] there is for it
[3568.46 → 3569.20] but all of a sudden
[3569.20 → 3571.06] if I just start talking about it
[3571.06 → 3572.40] then people might get
[3572.40 → 3573.18] the wrong idea,
[3573.64 → 3574.20] maybe only,
[3574.52 → 3574.74] you know,
[3575.00 → 3576.68] maybe 90% of people
[3576.68 → 3577.38] would just rather
[3577.38 → 3578.26] we invest that
[3578.26 → 3579.28] into hiring more people
[3579.28 → 3580.58] so that they're not working as hard.
[3580.86 → 3580.98] Like,
[3581.00 → 3581.72] these are conversations
[3581.72 → 3582.06] that,
[3582.24 → 3583.16] especially in the early days,
[3583.20 → 3583.86] we had a lot.
[3584.18 → 3584.40] Like,
[3584.42 → 3585.16] I'd sit down
[3585.16 → 3585.70] with,
[3585.76 → 3586.04] you know,
[3586.16 → 3587.38] Luke and Brandon
[3587.38 → 3588.20] and Taryn
[3588.20 → 3589.34] and OGs like that
[3589.34 → 3589.68] and I'd say,
[3589.72 → 3589.82] hey,
[3589.86 → 3590.10] look,
[3591.14 → 3592.20] coming into this year,
[3593.26 → 3594.86] I could pay you more.
[3596.44 → 3596.88] However,
[3596.88 → 3599.28] you'd have to keep working
[3599.28 → 3599.96] at this pace
[3599.96 → 3603.50] or I could hire more people.
[3604.40 → 3605.76] I'm kind of leaning towards
[3605.76 → 3606.86] door number two here.
[3607.26 → 3608.38] What do you guys think?
[3609.14 → 3609.50] And,
[3609.62 → 3609.88] you know,
[3610.10 → 3611.46] I think I got it right
[3611.46 → 3612.28] for the most part
[3612.28 → 3613.78] and,
[3613.90 → 3614.00] you know,
[3614.04 → 3615.06] obviously that doesn't mean
[3615.06 → 3616.34] that we were just freezing pay
[3616.34 → 3618.30] at any stage
[3618.30 → 3618.90] and all of that.
[3619.04 → 3619.30] Like,
[3619.36 → 3621.60] we were constantly trying
[3621.60 → 3622.84] to do better
[3622.84 → 3623.86] as far as that went as well.
[3623.90 → 3624.74] It's a balancing act,
[3624.74 → 3624.92] right?
[3625.22 → 3627.12] But we were also trying to,
[3627.36 → 3628.18] so we're trying to make the place
[3628.18 → 3628.96] a better place to work
[3628.96 → 3630.74] while also adding more people,
[3630.88 → 3631.82] building more infrastructure.
[3632.24 → 3633.28] The point is that
[3633.28 → 3634.42] I want to know.
[3634.50 → 3635.18] I need to know
[3635.18 → 3636.82] because if I don't know
[3636.82 → 3637.66] what people want,
[3637.82 → 3638.66] I'm just guessing.
[3640.18 → 3640.72] What's up?
[3647.48 → 3647.88] Oh.
[3648.56 → 3648.96] Oh,
[3649.04 → 3649.26] yeah.
[3649.44 → 3649.72] Yeah.
[3649.84 → 3650.18] Okay.
[3650.82 → 3651.34] You know,
[3651.58 → 3653.36] I think Luke has some strong feelings
[3653.36 → 3653.94] about this.
[3653.94 → 3655.82] If you really need
[3655.82 → 3656.74] and want to fix,
[3657.28 → 3659.90] don't just bring the problem.
[3660.38 → 3661.68] Find a reasonable solution
[3661.68 → 3662.60] and suggest it.
[3663.56 → 3665.38] Maybe even make them think
[3665.38 → 3666.72] it was their idea
[3666.72 → 3669.14] by bringing them
[3669.14 → 3669.98] to that conclusion.
[3670.12 → 3671.06] I'm sure he's done it to me.
[3674.92 → 3675.40] Yeah.
[3675.64 → 3676.02] I mean,
[3676.42 → 3678.58] it's communication 101.
[3679.14 → 3679.90] Whether you're
[3679.90 → 3681.86] in the supervisory
[3681.86 → 3684.16] or the reporting to,
[3684.48 → 3687.28] how do I describe these roles?
[3687.42 → 3688.60] Whether you're higher
[3688.60 → 3691.10] on the pyramid chart,
[3691.26 → 3691.82] the company,
[3692.66 → 3693.82] what's it called?
[3693.98 → 3694.36] Pyramid?
[3694.82 → 3695.14] Pyramid?
[3695.22 → 3695.74] Is that what it's called?
[3695.82 → 3696.56] What's the company?
[3696.64 → 3696.98] Org chart.
[3697.44 → 3698.16] Whether you're higher
[3698.16 → 3698.82] on the org chart
[3698.82 → 3700.00] or lower on the org chart,
[3700.34 → 3702.06] it is such an important
[3702.06 → 3703.28] communication skill
[3703.28 → 3705.34] to bring people ideas
[3705.34 → 3706.16] in a way that is
[3706.16 → 3707.24] non-confrontational.
[3707.24 → 3708.78] If I can bring you
[3708.78 → 3709.34] an idea
[3709.34 → 3711.72] and make you feel like
[3711.72 → 3713.06] you can relate
[3713.06 → 3713.88] with my struggle
[3713.88 → 3715.88] and that my solution
[3715.88 → 3717.52] sounds super reasonable
[3717.52 → 3718.06] to you,
[3718.18 → 3718.96] then the chances
[3718.96 → 3720.20] of implementing it
[3720.20 → 3720.92] are much,
[3721.04 → 3721.42] much higher.
[3721.94 → 3723.30] With all of that said,
[3723.48 → 3724.30] the second part
[3724.30 → 3725.22] of your question is,
[3725.32 → 3725.48] hey,
[3725.62 → 3726.50] when do I go,
[3727.04 → 3728.38] this is a lost cause,
[3728.56 → 3729.80] and just bail?
[3730.62 → 3731.96] There's a solid chance
[3731.96 → 3733.12] that that's going to be it.
[3733.12 → 3735.98] One of our rock stars,
[3736.26 → 3738.46] Kyle from Creator Warehouse Engineering,
[3738.66 → 3739.32] love Kyle,
[3739.40 → 3739.86] he's great.
[3741.46 → 3741.76] You know,
[3742.00 → 3743.36] a big problem for him
[3743.36 → 3745.12] at a previous position,
[3745.38 → 3745.96] I'm not going to say
[3745.96 → 3747.20] it was the one right before this,
[3747.22 → 3747.88] I'm not going to say
[3747.88 → 3749.42] if it was two before this,
[3749.78 → 3750.50] we're not going to name
[3750.50 → 3751.16] any names here,
[3751.50 → 3753.14] but at a previous position,
[3753.56 → 3755.12] he had expressed some concern
[3755.70 → 3761.30] about basically some costs
[3761.30 → 3762.50] that were associated
[3762.50 → 3764.24] with his remaining employed there,
[3764.34 → 3765.94] him remaining employed there.
[3766.44 → 3766.66] Okay?
[3767.20 → 3768.68] The situation was going
[3768.68 → 3770.50] to become untenable for him.
[3770.78 → 3772.28] He wasn't even asking
[3772.28 → 3773.10] for a raise.
[3773.62 → 3774.58] He wasn't just like,
[3775.00 → 3775.78] give me more money.
[3776.62 → 3777.12] He just,
[3777.26 → 3778.16] he just had,
[3778.32 → 3779.36] there were some costs
[3779.36 → 3780.56] that were associated
[3780.56 → 3781.52] with him working there
[3781.52 → 3783.22] that he needed
[3783.22 → 3784.22] some solution to.
[3784.72 → 3785.94] And in effect,
[3786.16 → 3787.14] they basically said,
[3787.32 → 3787.90] deal with it.
[3788.40 → 3789.18] And he did.
[3789.74 → 3790.64] And he came here.
[3791.30 → 3792.12] Right?
[3792.44 → 3793.20] Well, eventually.
[3794.04 → 3794.40] So,
[3794.78 → 3796.54] that could happen.
[3797.02 → 3797.82] Some people just,
[3798.34 → 3799.42] they don't care about you.
[3800.60 → 3802.02] They see you as,
[3802.52 → 3804.18] I hate the word,
[3804.46 → 3805.54] I hate the term HR.
[3806.32 → 3807.28] They see you as
[3807.28 → 3808.40] human resources.
[3809.24 → 3809.68] Effectively,
[3809.92 → 3811.04] warm bodies
[3811.04 → 3812.34] that can be mined
[3812.34 → 3813.30] for productivity.
[3815.32 → 3816.60] And that's just the way,
[3816.64 → 3817.20] that's just the way
[3817.20 → 3817.66] it's going to be.
[3817.78 → 3818.50] And you just have to,
[3818.70 → 3818.82] you know,
[3818.88 → 3819.64] karma's a bitch, right?
[3819.64 → 3819.84] Like,
[3819.86 → 3820.54] you just have to hope
[3820.54 → 3821.34] that at some point
[3821.34 → 3822.48] that's going to bite them
[3822.48 → 3822.90] in the ass,
[3822.96 → 3823.50] no one's going to want
[3823.50 → 3824.06] to work for them.
[3824.08 → 3824.56] And honestly,
[3824.76 → 3825.66] I think we're seeing
[3825.66 → 3826.50] a lot of that today.
[3827.00 → 3827.66] Labour shortage?
[3828.22 → 3828.84] There's no fucking
[3828.84 → 3829.56] labour shortage.
[3830.24 → 3831.40] How many resumes you get?
[3831.58 → 3832.30] Thousand resumes
[3832.30 → 3832.84] or whatever
[3832.84 → 3833.64] for some positions?
[3833.82 → 3834.00] Yeah,
[3834.14 → 3834.36] a lot,
[3834.46 → 3834.72] a lot.
[3835.60 → 3836.56] No labour shortage.
[3837.36 → 3838.14] You got a pay
[3838.14 → 3839.08] and benefit shortage.
[3839.88 → 3840.74] That's your problem.
[3841.28 → 3841.92] Figure it out.
[3842.54 → 3842.88] And like,
[3842.92 → 3843.64] the thing that drives me
[3843.64 → 3844.64] most crazy is like,
[3844.70 → 3845.48] McDonald's food
[3845.48 → 3847.04] doesn't fucking cost more
[3847.04 → 3847.60] in places where
[3847.60 → 3848.50] they pay a living wage.
[3848.88 → 3849.84] It's still cheap.
[3850.28 → 3850.60] Why?
[3851.26 → 3852.04] Because it is.
[3852.88 → 3853.62] You're just taking
[3853.62 → 3854.24] more of it.
[3855.06 → 3856.48] So just pay more of it.
[3859.32 → 3859.68] Anywho.
[3861.86 → 3862.30] All right,
[3862.34 → 3863.04] let's move on to,
[3863.40 → 3864.34] we should get some sponsors.
[3864.48 → 3865.32] We should get some sponsors
[3865.32 → 3865.62] by the way.
[3865.68 → 3866.38] We got to pay for,
[3866.52 → 3868.02] we got to pay for all this somehow.
[3870.10 → 3871.26] The show is brought to you
[3871.26 → 3872.88] by our wonderful sponsors.
[3873.50 → 3874.98] During whose reads here,
[3874.98 → 3876.24] I am not going to use
[3876.24 → 3876.88] any profanity
[3876.88 → 3877.86] because that's just
[3877.86 → 3878.64] not in my nature.
[3879.60 → 3880.44] Starting with,
[3880.78 → 3881.34] help me out, Dan.
[3882.36 → 3882.72] Notion.
[3883.56 → 3884.84] Notion is an easy
[3884.84 → 3885.60] to use platform
[3885.60 → 3887.00] to actually commit
[3887.00 → 3888.04] to your goals this year
[3888.04 → 3888.86] and see them through.
[3889.26 → 3890.02] You can use Notion
[3890.02 → 3890.58] to plan,
[3890.90 → 3891.22] track,
[3891.34 → 3892.32] and do all of your work
[3892.32 → 3893.20] in the same space.
[3893.58 → 3894.84] It's great for collaboration
[3894.84 → 3895.52] with one place
[3895.52 → 3896.22] to share ideas
[3896.22 → 3896.82] and work together
[3896.82 → 3897.24] on everything
[3897.24 → 3898.04] from group projects
[3898.04 → 3898.76] to vacations.
[3899.14 → 3900.28] It allows you to take notes,
[3900.64 → 3901.28] manage tasks,
[3901.40 → 3901.82] set goals,
[3901.86 → 3902.48] and so much more.
[3902.56 → 3902.92] Oh man,
[3902.92 → 3904.98] I should have Yvonne use this.
[3905.48 → 3906.94] We're trying to put together
[3906.94 → 3907.88] a family trip
[3907.88 → 3909.10] sometime this coming year
[3909.10 → 3910.90] and there's like,
[3911.26 → 3912.46] there are friends involved
[3912.46 → 3913.98] and family members involved
[3913.98 → 3916.44] and spouses and children of them
[3916.44 → 3919.44] and once removed,
[3919.82 → 3920.08] you know,
[3920.22 → 3921.40] acquaintances of theirs
[3921.40 → 3922.58] and getting everybody
[3922.58 → 3923.36] on the same page
[3923.36 → 3924.52] is a nightmare.
[3924.88 → 3925.20] Anywho,
[3925.62 → 3926.72] you can build your Notion
[3926.72 → 3927.30] to be your own
[3927.30 → 3928.26] personalized home base
[3928.26 → 3929.10] for anything you want
[3929.10 → 3929.96] to track in 2023.
[3930.24 → 3931.30] It's very customizable
[3931.30 → 3932.78] so you can tailor the tools
[3932.78 → 3933.66] to fit your team
[3933.66 → 3934.74] or your own needs.
[3934.98 → 3936.18] You can make your workspace
[3936.18 → 3937.66] beautiful and fun to use too
[3937.66 → 3938.54] with your favourite emojis,
[3938.68 → 3939.24] GIFs, images,
[3939.84 → 3940.94] whatever you want.
[3941.22 → 3941.76] With Notion,
[3941.84 → 3943.28] the world is your oyster.
[3944.06 → 3945.12] Many of us in the office
[3945.12 → 3945.70] use Notion.
[3945.80 → 3945.98] Oh,
[3946.08 → 3947.04] I actually didn't know.
[3947.32 → 3947.88] That's cool.
[3948.36 → 3949.30] Even personally,
[3949.70 → 3950.52] to seamlessly manage
[3950.52 → 3950.92] and collaborate
[3950.92 → 3951.58] on different projects
[3951.58 → 3952.18] around the office.
[3953.14 → 3953.46] I,
[3953.80 → 3954.92] okay,
[3955.46 → 3956.68] I've got to try this.
[3956.84 → 3957.86] So what are you waiting for?

[3960.66 → 3961.66] in the video description.
[3962.34 → 3963.76] The show is also brought to you
[3963.76 → 3965.06] by FreshBooks.
[3965.50 → 3966.44] I'm guessing you're not
[3966.44 → 3966.90] an accountant.
[3968.22 → 3968.72] I mean,
[3968.78 → 3969.70] statistically speaking,
[3969.88 → 3970.80] you're probably
[3970.80 → 3971.50] not an accountant.
[3972.14 → 3973.26] And working on your books
[3973.26 → 3973.74] can bring up
[3973.74 → 3975.04] very difficult questions
[3975.04 → 3975.94] like what numbers go
[3975.94 → 3976.50] in what column?
[3977.26 → 3978.30] And what report
[3978.30 → 3979.08] should I be looking at?
[3979.38 → 3979.62] What is,
[3979.68 → 3979.82] I mean,
[3979.84 → 3980.84] we talked about this last week.
[3981.02 → 3981.94] What is earnings
[3981.94 → 3983.16] versus net profit?
[3983.50 → 3984.58] What is gross profit?
[3985.18 → 3986.76] How does all of this compare?
[3986.76 → 3987.24] Right?
[3988.14 → 3988.54] FreshBooks
[3988.54 → 3989.98] is an easy-to-use
[3989.98 → 3990.78] accounting solution
[3990.78 → 3991.76] that makes it simple
[3991.76 → 3992.64] to send invoices
[3992.64 → 3993.92] and collect your cash
[3993.92 → 3994.96] and just keep track
[3994.96 → 3995.54] of things, man.
[3995.98 → 3996.32] FreshBooks
[3996.32 → 3997.38] was created specifically
[3997.38 → 3998.52] for both business owners
[3998.52 → 4000.04] and accounting professionals
[4000.04 → 4001.36] hitting a sweet spot
[4001.36 → 4002.24] between usable
[4002.24 → 4003.56] and useful.
[4003.88 → 4004.30] Plus,
[4004.58 → 4005.40] it keeps your income
[4005.40 → 4006.44] and expenses organized
[4006.44 → 4007.48] so you won't be begging
[4007.48 → 4008.50] your accountant for help
[4008.50 → 4009.72] the day before taxes are due.
[4010.06 → 4011.00] It has everything you need
[4011.00 → 4011.76] to manage your books
[4011.76 → 4012.52] like invoicing,
[4012.78 → 4013.84] expense and time tracking,
[4014.10 → 4014.86] automated payments,
[4014.86 → 4016.48] and reports to tell you
[4016.48 → 4017.80] how healthy your business is.
[4018.12 → 4018.58] Don't wait.
[4018.84 → 4019.96] Go to freshbooks.com

[4020.60 → 4022.18] to save 90%

[4024.26 → 4025.54] I think that's a new offer.

[4027.16 → 4027.84] So go check it out.
[4028.14 → 4029.34] That's a really nice
[4029.34 → 4030.66] long trial period too
[4030.66 → 4031.46] because it gives you time
[4031.46 → 4032.92] to actually get familiar with it.
[4033.32 → 4034.26] The show is also brought to you
[4034.26 → 4034.82] by Squarespace.
[4035.26 → 4036.18] Who we pay for.
[4036.52 → 4037.50] I only found that out
[4037.50 → 4038.58] a couple of shows ago,
[4038.64 → 4038.92] I think.
[4039.16 → 4040.24] We are paying customers
[4040.24 → 4040.76] of Squarespace.
[4040.94 → 4041.78] We actually use them.
[4043.22 → 4044.14] Running your own business
[4044.14 → 4044.72] can be hard,
[4044.82 → 4045.58] but making your website
[4045.58 → 4046.38] doesn't have to be.
[4046.46 → 4047.76] Squarespace is an all-in-one platform
[4047.76 → 4048.66] that makes it easy
[4048.66 → 4049.34] to get your website

[4057.52 → 4058.08] of award-winning
[4058.08 → 4059.14] mobile-optimized templates.

[4085.52 → 4086.36] Next topic.
[4087.60 → 4087.90] Man,
[4087.96 → 4088.76] I'm kind of feeling
[4088.76 → 4090.44] the Windows 8.1
[4090.44 → 4091.06] end of support.
[4091.54 → 4092.08] What do you think?
[4093.00 → 4093.52] Yeah,
[4093.58 → 4094.10] let's do it.
[4094.34 → 4095.46] Windows 8.1
[4095.46 → 4096.52] reached end of support
[4096.52 → 4097.16] on Tuesday,
[4097.36 → 4098.44] January 10th.
[4098.56 → 4099.18] This sucks.
[4099.18 → 4100.32] I actually still have
[4100.32 → 4102.08] an active Windows 8.1
[4102.08 → 4103.26] right now.
[4103.38 → 4105.22] It's not like normal
[4105.22 → 4106.16] Windows 8.1.
[4106.28 → 4107.04] It's Windows 9
[4107.04 → 4109.72] that sort of stripped down
[4109.72 → 4110.86] 8.1 embedded
[4110.86 → 4112.48] or whatever it was called
[4112.48 → 4115.04] that we made a video about.
[4115.24 → 4115.50] Man,
[4115.56 → 4116.22] I looked at that thing.
[4116.32 → 4116.58] I was like,
[4116.72 → 4116.98] man,
[4117.98 → 4118.92] it's fucking snappy.
[4119.82 → 4120.46] It was amazing.
[4121.08 → 4122.44] And so I immediately
[4122.44 → 4123.64] set it up on a VM
[4123.64 → 4124.72] that to this day
[4124.72 → 4125.58] I still use.
[4126.44 → 4127.34] So I'm going to have
[4127.34 → 4130.20] to update that thing.
[4130.94 → 4131.92] That sucks.
[4132.38 → 4133.78] Because that's my sketchy VM
[4133.78 → 4134.60] that I've just used
[4134.60 → 4135.02] for like,
[4135.12 → 4135.32] oh,
[4135.38 → 4136.92] this is like a weird program.
[4137.08 → 4137.26] Okay,
[4137.38 → 4140.26] let's disconnect it
[4140.26 → 4141.28] from the rest of the network
[4141.28 → 4144.20] and see what it does.
[4145.06 → 4147.00] And because it's so bare bones,
[4147.28 → 4148.34] it's really easy to tell
[4148.34 → 4149.18] if anything is there
[4149.18 → 4150.36] that's not supposed to be there.
[4150.68 → 4150.86] Like,
[4150.94 → 4151.10] ah,
[4151.12 → 4151.26] man,
[4151.30 → 4151.52] I just,
[4151.94 → 4152.90] I love that VM.
[4152.90 → 4155.48] It's been through a lot with me.
[4155.74 → 4156.02] Anyway,
[4156.66 → 4157.60] technical support,
[4157.96 → 4158.72] software updates,
[4158.92 → 4160.00] and security fixes
[4160.00 → 4161.32] will no longer be provided.
[4161.48 → 4162.26] You're not going to say anything.
[4162.90 → 4164.36] And Microsoft is recommending
[4164.36 → 4165.28] that customers move
[4165.28 → 4166.42] to a more current version
[4166.42 → 4166.82] of Windows.
[4167.18 → 4168.68] They are not offering
[4168.68 → 4169.86] a free upgrade path
[4169.86 → 4170.74] from Windows 8.1
[4170.74 → 4171.94] to Windows 10 or 11.
[4172.54 → 4173.74] And unlike what happened
[4173.74 → 4174.44] with Windows 7,
[4174.54 → 4175.86] Microsoft will not be offering
[4175.86 → 4177.54] an extended security update program
[4177.54 → 4178.52] for Windows 8.1,
[4178.62 → 4179.66] probably because nobody
[4179.66 → 4180.86] would even want it.
[4180.86 → 4182.64] The ESU program
[4182.64 → 4183.78] for a number of older products
[4183.78 → 4184.98] actually also came to an end
[4184.98 → 4185.44] on Tuesday,
[4185.56 → 4187.02] including Windows 7 Professional
[4187.02 → 4187.94] and Enterprise versions
[4187.94 → 4190.38] and Windows Server 2008 R2.
[4191.52 → 4192.22] Fun fact,
[4192.32 → 4193.98] I was actually using Windows Vista
[4193.98 → 4194.82] earlier this week.
[4195.96 → 4197.56] And Windows 8.1
[4197.56 → 4198.52] is not going to be
[4198.52 → 4199.76] as bad as that,
[4200.14 → 4201.06] but I can tell you,
[4201.12 → 4202.26] using an outdated version
[4202.26 → 4202.76] of Windows,
[4203.64 → 4204.98] it gets pretty rough
[4204.98 → 4205.68] after a while.
[4206.30 → 4206.74] So,
[4207.04 → 4208.34] it was good up until,
[4208.44 → 4209.04] I think it was,
[4209.08 → 4210.10] about two years ago.
[4210.10 → 4210.90] We got our hands
[4210.90 → 4213.16] on the Dell XPS M2010,
[4213.50 → 4214.24] I think it's called.
[4214.52 → 4216.32] It's a wild laptop.
[4216.58 → 4217.40] I can't imagine
[4217.40 → 4218.20] they made more than,
[4218.26 → 4218.52] like,
[4218.92 → 4220.12] hundreds of these,
[4220.60 → 4221.58] if even that.
[4221.66 → 4221.78] Like,
[4221.82 → 4222.82] I can't even imagine
[4222.82 → 4223.76] who would buy this thing.
[4224.14 → 4224.48] But,
[4224.54 → 4225.52] we got our hands on it
[4225.52 → 4226.46] and that thing shipped
[4226.46 → 4227.46] with Windows Vista.
[4228.54 → 4228.94] And,
[4229.02 → 4229.32] apparently,
[4229.42 → 4229.94] it was pretty good
[4229.94 → 4230.96] up until just a couple
[4230.96 → 4231.80] of years ago
[4231.80 → 4234.14] when support for,
[4234.64 → 4235.56] when Chromium
[4235.56 → 4237.28] stopped supporting Vista.
[4237.52 → 4237.80] So,
[4237.88 → 4238.26] effectively,
[4238.26 → 4239.50] you couldn't do anything
[4239.50 → 4240.04] in a browser.
[4240.48 → 4241.46] I think Valve
[4241.46 → 4242.60] pulled support for Vista
[4242.60 → 4243.34] and Steam
[4243.34 → 4245.04] around that time as well.
[4245.10 → 4245.90] Don't quote me on that.
[4246.10 → 4247.04] I could have the timing
[4247.04 → 4248.34] a little bit off.
[4248.80 → 4249.02] But,
[4249.50 → 4249.72] man,
[4250.04 → 4251.72] you try to do anything
[4251.72 → 4252.90] on Vista today
[4252.90 → 4254.52] and it's bad.
[4254.60 → 4255.34] Even ignoring
[4255.34 → 4256.36] the security issues,
[4256.40 → 4257.04] let me tell you.
[4258.32 → 4259.08] I tried,
[4259.14 → 4260.12] I tried to load up,
[4260.18 → 4261.24] I tried to load up
[4261.24 → 4262.60] RottenTomatoes.com,
[4262.76 → 4263.00] okay,
[4263.20 → 4264.82] so that I could check reviews
[4264.82 → 4266.24] for a Blu-ray
[4266.24 → 4266.88] to determine
[4266.88 → 4267.72] if I was willing
[4267.72 → 4268.90] to risk losing it
[4268.90 → 4269.66] in the
[4269.66 → 4271.20] in the pop-up
[4271.20 → 4273.44] motorized optical drive
[4273.44 → 4274.36] on the top of this laptop.
[4274.46 → 4274.60] Guys,
[4274.68 → 4275.66] do not miss that video.
[4276.38 → 4277.14] I was like,
[4277.28 → 4278.48] do I care about this Blu-ray?
[4279.92 → 4280.66] And then,
[4281.64 → 4283.42] I could manually calculate
[4283.42 → 4284.70] the percentage of thumbs up
[4284.70 → 4285.70] and thumbs down reviews
[4285.70 → 4287.08] because I could,
[4287.16 → 4288.58] I could see how many there were,
[4288.64 → 4290.24] but the actual images
[4290.24 → 4290.60] weren't,
[4290.66 → 4291.18] weren't loading.
[4292.72 → 4293.40] It was,
[4293.40 → 4294.30] it was pretty rough.
[4295.20 → 4296.84] Our discussion question here
[4296.84 → 4297.64] is,
[4297.90 → 4298.68] where would you rank
[4298.68 → 4300.46] Windows 8 slash 8.1
[4300.46 → 4302.26] on a best to worst list
[4302.26 → 4303.20] of Windows versions?
[4303.58 → 4304.66] This is one of those things
[4304.66 → 4305.50] that's kind of like
[4305.50 → 4307.32] 98,
[4307.66 → 4308.66] 98 SE,
[4309.00 → 4309.66] and ME,
[4310.18 → 4311.46] where the lines
[4311.46 → 4313.36] are a little blurry.
[4313.74 → 4314.74] You can't ask me
[4314.74 → 4315.54] where would you rank
[4315.54 → 4317.22] Windows 8 slash 8.1
[4317.22 → 4319.20] because Windows 8 and 8.1,
[4320.72 → 4321.76] let's just say
[4321.76 → 4323.38] Microsoft learned a lot
[4323.38 → 4324.54] from Windows 8
[4324.54 → 4326.50] and Windows 8.1
[4326.50 → 4327.80] was far less
[4327.80 → 4328.58] of a piece of shit.
[4330.54 → 4331.42] I would rank
[4331.42 → 4332.10] Windows 8,
[4332.22 → 4332.76] oh man,
[4333.28 → 4333.44] see,
[4333.50 → 4334.22] I liked Vista.
[4334.84 → 4335.02] So,
[4335.42 → 4335.78] let's go,
[4335.90 → 4336.06] man,
[4336.16 → 4336.70] you know what?
[4336.76 → 4337.92] That'd be kind of a fun video.
[4338.60 → 4338.80] Like,
[4338.98 → 4339.34] ranking,
[4339.72 → 4340.62] ranking Windows
[4340.62 → 4341.72] and like,
[4341.76 → 4342.06] just like,
[4342.14 → 4343.30] Windows tier list.
[4344.46 → 4344.86] Yeah,
[4345.06 → 4345.26] oh,
[4345.34 → 4345.98] that could be a fun
[4345.98 → 4346.86] float plane exclusive
[4346.86 → 4347.88] doing like,
[4348.34 → 4348.60] hey,
[4348.60 → 4348.76] hey,
[4348.76 → 4348.92] hey,
[4348.92 → 4349.16] Dan,
[4349.62 → 4351.62] can you ping the social team
[4351.62 → 4353.38] and actually cc James
[4353.38 → 4354.30] and let them fight it out
[4354.30 → 4354.96] over whether that's
[4354.96 → 4355.70] an LTT video
[4355.70 → 4356.28] or whether it's
[4356.28 → 4357.16] a float plane exclusive,
[4357.38 → 4358.10] just like kind of
[4358.10 → 4359.04] casual social video.
[4359.38 → 4360.32] But we should do,
[4360.36 → 4360.88] we should do like
[4360.88 → 4361.84] a Windows tier list.
[4362.84 → 4363.76] Just a Windows tier list?
[4363.92 → 4364.90] I wasn't listening at all.
[4364.98 → 4365.12] Yeah,
[4365.20 → 4366.06] Windows tier list.
[4366.14 → 4366.90] So we take all the
[4366.90 → 4367.84] editions of Windows
[4367.84 → 4368.98] and we have people,
[4369.04 → 4369.92] we have people rank them
[4369.92 → 4370.50] best to worst.
[4370.50 → 4373.84] Even good
[4373.84 → 4375.84] pre-NT Windows,
[4376.16 → 4377.84] like DOS based Windows
[4377.84 → 4378.74] 98 SE
[4378.74 → 4380.26] was not very good.
[4380.80 → 4381.86] It crashed a lot.
[4382.00 → 4382.64] It had a lot of
[4382.64 → 4383.66] compatibility issues
[4383.66 → 4384.38] in spite of the fact
[4384.38 → 4384.84] that it was running
[4384.84 → 4385.70] on top of DOS.
[4386.10 → 4386.78] DOS programs
[4386.78 → 4388.04] just would not work
[4388.04 → 4388.76] a lot of the time.
[4389.56 → 4390.68] I think it's hard
[4390.68 → 4391.66] to call Windows 8
[4391.66 → 4392.96] legitimately worse
[4392.96 → 4394.16] than anything
[4394.16 → 4395.82] before the NT kernel.
[4396.40 → 4397.74] But I would say
[4397.74 → 4398.82] that Windows 8
[4398.82 → 4401.42] was probably the worst
[4401.42 → 4403.16] of the post-NT kernel
[4403.16 → 4404.04] operating systems
[4404.04 → 4404.52] for me.
[4405.96 → 4406.20] Like,
[4406.60 → 4407.98] 11 has its issues,
[4408.14 → 4408.78] but they're not
[4408.78 → 4409.76] stability issues.
[4410.14 → 4411.44] They're not just like
[4411.44 → 4411.86] utterly,
[4412.22 → 4413.10] making it utterly
[4413.10 → 4414.76] unusable issues
[4414.76 → 4415.34] with the keyboard
[4415.34 → 4415.84] and mouse,
[4415.94 → 4416.16] right?
[4417.52 → 4417.88] You know,
[4418.30 → 4419.92] and Windows 8,
[4420.12 → 4420.88] as I talked about
[4420.88 → 4421.36] before,
[4421.62 → 4422.92] with the Windows 9
[4422.92 → 4423.54] experience,
[4424.18 → 4427.56] could get wildly
[4427.56 → 4427.98] better.
[4428.82 → 4429.20] like,
[4429.32 → 4429.76] I would,
[4430.44 → 4430.80] I mean,
[4430.84 → 4431.64] I've told you guys,
[4431.80 → 4432.08] 8.0,
[4432.12 → 4434.10] if I could have had
[4434.10 → 4435.26] the latest versions
[4435.26 → 4436.58] of DirectX supported,
[4437.46 → 4438.86] there is no reason
[4438.86 → 4439.90] why I couldn't have
[4439.90 → 4441.08] just continued running
[4441.08 → 4442.32] 8.1 embedded
[4442.32 → 4443.30] with modifications,
[4443.52 → 4444.58] kept running Windows 9
[4444.58 → 4445.22] until today.
[4445.42 → 4447.10] There is no reason
[4447.10 → 4448.06] for me to not do that.
[4448.10 → 4449.34] It is so usable.
[4449.48 → 4450.18] Start menu search
[4450.18 → 4450.94] works fine.
[4451.26 → 4452.10] It's much easier
[4452.10 → 4453.00] to get at your network
[4453.00 → 4454.24] configuration panel.
[4454.56 → 4454.74] Oh,
[4454.88 → 4455.76] you don't have that
[4455.76 → 4456.56] bullshit,
[4456.98 → 4458.40] terrible control panel,
[4458.40 → 4459.72] that's just like,
[4459.96 → 4461.06] sits on top of the
[4461.06 → 4462.10] regular control panel
[4462.10 → 4462.98] and makes everything
[4462.98 → 4463.70] more difficult.
[4464.60 → 4464.88] Actually,
[4464.94 → 4465.56] I think you did have
[4465.56 → 4466.18] a little bit of that,
[4466.24 → 4467.20] but it wasn't as bad.
[4467.58 → 4468.48] The whole regular
[4468.48 → 4469.40] control panel was
[4469.40 → 4469.90] still there,
[4470.02 → 4470.34] damn it.
[4471.74 → 4472.12] Yeah,
[4472.28 → 4472.44] no,
[4472.56 → 4474.12] I liked 8.1
[4474.12 → 4474.88] with the right tweaks,
[4475.52 → 4476.70] but then I liked Vista,
[4476.84 → 4478.08] so what the fuck
[4478.08 → 4478.58] do I know?
[4479.14 → 4479.80] Fucking idiot.
[4479.80 → 4484.02] I was running Vista
[4484.02 → 4485.06] on modern hardware.
[4485.06 → 4487.00] I didn't try to plug in
[4487.00 → 4489.44] my old 98SE era printer.
[4489.80 → 4491.18] That's a big difference,
[4491.64 → 4491.92] right?
[4493.22 → 4495.02] Windows Vista worked great
[4495.02 → 4496.84] on a brand-new computer
[4496.84 → 4498.36] playing current gen games
[4498.36 → 4500.00] because it was what
[4500.00 → 4501.28] everyone was validating with.
[4502.36 → 4502.64] Ah,
[4502.82 → 4503.12] yeah,
[4503.22 → 4503.50] okay.
[4504.74 → 4505.28] Luke,
[4505.36 → 4506.00] on the other hand,
[4506.08 → 4506.98] worked at Geek Squad
[4506.98 → 4508.44] in the Windows Vista days
[4508.44 → 4511.04] and it was a bloodbath
[4511.04 → 4512.34] of low-spec laptops.
[4512.94 → 4513.06] Yeah,
[4513.16 → 4515.22] I think that's very fair to say.
[4515.94 → 4517.48] If you had the specs for it,
[4517.60 → 4518.36] it ran great.
[4519.26 → 4520.26] But if you were running
[4520.26 → 4521.78] like 32-bit Vista
[4521.78 → 4524.84] on some piece of crap laptop,
[4525.26 → 4527.52] it was a pretty bad time.
[4528.12 → 4528.92] Pretty bad time.
[4534.34 → 4534.98] All right,
[4535.30 → 4535.92] why don't we do,
[4536.08 → 4537.22] let's do two more merch messages
[4537.22 → 4538.14] and then we'll move
[4538.14 → 4538.82] into another topic.
[4539.10 → 4539.42] Hit me,
[4539.50 → 4539.64] Dan.
[4539.90 → 4540.18] Okay,
[4540.24 → 4540.82] I have to find them.
[4541.92 → 4542.28] Whoa.
[4542.92 → 4543.26] Okay,
[4543.36 → 4543.62] here we go.
[4543.64 → 4544.34] I thought that's your whole job
[4544.34 → 4545.66] over there is finding merch messages.
[4545.96 → 4546.26] Yeah,
[4546.36 → 4546.82] but...
[4546.82 → 4547.02] I mean,
[4547.04 → 4548.24] he also monitors the audio.
[4548.40 → 4549.36] I have to scroll down to it.
[4549.40 → 4550.06] He helps you guys
[4550.06 → 4550.84] listen to the echo.
[4551.88 → 4552.24] Co,
[4552.36 → 4552.66] co,
[4552.88 → 4553.16] co,
[4553.16 → 4553.56] co.
[4553.64 → 4554.18] Stop it.
[4555.24 → 4555.74] All right,
[4555.80 → 4556.24] let's see.
[4560.08 → 4561.68] I think we got that one done too.
[4563.12 → 4563.88] You got this.
[4564.36 → 4565.42] Do you mean to do a quick topic
[4565.42 → 4566.08] while you look through it?
[4566.08 → 4566.12] No,
[4566.12 → 4566.68] I got Matthias.
[4567.36 → 4569.18] Loving the super edgy episode,
[4569.32 → 4570.46] laughing throughout the whole show.
[4570.56 → 4571.24] Question for Linus.
[4571.24 → 4572.26] Do you take any actions
[4572.26 → 4573.78] to protect the long-term health
[4573.78 → 4574.58] of your voice
[4574.58 → 4575.82] with all the hosting
[4575.82 → 4577.12] of episodes and live shows?
[4577.46 → 4578.46] Excited for LTX
[4578.46 → 4579.92] and lttstore.com?
[4581.04 → 4581.48] No,
[4581.78 → 4582.02] no,
[4582.10 → 4583.16] I can't say that I do,
[4583.32 → 4584.42] but one of the things
[4584.42 → 4585.66] that I do...
[4585.66 → 4589.40] Nice.
[4589.76 → 4591.02] One of the things I do
[4591.02 → 4595.02] is I just use my natural talking voice.
[4595.38 → 4597.80] I'm not putting on a voice for you guys.
[4598.14 → 4599.12] I'm louder,
[4599.50 → 4601.62] and that's something I've tried to work on,
[4602.00 → 4603.44] but every time,
[4603.58 → 4603.88] yeah,
[4604.04 → 4606.14] every time I'm quieter...
[4606.94 → 4607.18] Okay.
[4608.26 → 4609.20] Why don't I try?
[4609.20 → 4610.82] I will simply speak...
[4610.82 → 4611.72] I say I can't do it.
[4611.82 → 4613.56] I immediately start ramping up.
[4615.14 → 4616.32] Part of it is that
[4616.32 → 4617.52] when I'm on camera,
[4617.64 → 4618.98] I'm usually talking about something
[4618.98 → 4620.64] that I can get kind of fired up about.
[4621.36 → 4621.72] Otherwise,
[4621.90 → 4623.10] why are we making a video about it?
[4623.14 → 4623.26] Like,
[4623.34 → 4623.72] I was...
[4623.72 → 4624.24] Oh, man.
[4624.54 → 4625.74] I was in script review with...
[4627.22 → 4629.80] Oh, crap.
[4630.30 → 4630.84] What's that?
[4630.90 → 4631.66] Oh, yeah, right.
[4631.80 → 4633.64] I was in script review with Tanner today,
[4633.64 → 4635.08] and...
[4635.08 → 4637.34] Anyone outside my office
[4637.34 → 4639.84] probably thought I was laying into him
[4639.84 → 4641.44] because I was sitting there...
[4641.44 → 4642.14] I was sitting there going,
[4642.66 → 4643.62] how the fuck
[4643.62 → 4646.62] is this even still a problem in 2023?
[4647.90 → 4649.70] How is this even fucking possible?
[4650.80 → 4651.64] Right, you know...
[4652.76 → 4653.56] But I was...
[4653.56 → 4654.64] I was actually...
[4655.28 → 4655.66] You know,
[4655.94 → 4658.44] Tanner's more of a subdued kind of guy.
[4658.52 → 4659.74] He wouldn't say it like that,
[4659.80 → 4661.22] but it's not like he didn't agree.
[4661.48 → 4662.46] What I was talking about
[4662.46 → 4665.54] was the challenge of sharing files
[4665.54 → 4667.16] from one device to another.
[4667.60 → 4667.80] You know,
[4667.86 → 4669.16] Apple's kind of got it solved,
[4669.28 → 4670.64] but it doesn't count as solving it
[4670.64 → 4671.58] when you only solve it
[4671.58 → 4673.62] for people that are made of money
[4673.62 → 4675.60] and can afford an entire ecosystem
[4675.60 → 4676.22] of your products.
[4676.38 → 4676.66] That's...
[4676.66 → 4677.54] Fuck you, right?
[4677.64 → 4677.88] Like,
[4678.26 → 4679.12] that's not a solution.
[4679.28 → 4679.78] That's not a...
[4679.78 → 4681.04] That's not a real solution.
[4681.34 → 4682.96] What I want is a real solution.
[4683.18 → 4685.12] If I need to beam you a file
[4685.12 → 4686.56] from my phone to your laptop,
[4687.30 → 4688.96] that shit should be simple.
[4688.96 → 4692.56] It is 20 fucking three.
[4694.06 → 4694.46] Right?
[4694.60 → 4694.98] So anyway,
[4695.24 → 4696.14] the point is that
[4696.14 → 4697.50] even when I'm not on camera,
[4697.64 → 4698.96] I can get kind of...
[4699.52 → 4701.62] I can get kind of passionate about things,
[4702.00 → 4704.00] but that's just...
[4704.00 → 4705.30] That's just like my voice.
[4705.66 → 4706.70] And so when I'm on camera,
[4706.80 → 4707.70] that happens a lot,
[4707.94 → 4707.96] and...
[4709.34 → 4709.54] I mean,
[4709.60 → 4710.14] drink water?
[4711.52 → 4711.72] Well,
[4712.34 → 4712.64] you know?
[4713.54 → 4714.44] LTTstore.com.
[4715.26 → 4715.70] Bitches.
[4715.70 → 4717.90] I should have waited
[4717.90 → 4718.46] till he drank.
[4721.06 → 4722.02] Almost got him earlier
[4722.02 → 4722.64] with the slap.
[4726.88 → 4728.32] Do you want another one?
[4728.56 → 4728.96] Yeah,
[4729.04 → 4729.60] give me one more.
[4732.06 → 4732.46] Okay,
[4732.54 → 4733.70] this is from Daniel,
[4733.80 → 4734.44] not me.
[4734.96 → 4736.82] Getting some birthday merch.
[4737.22 → 4737.54] Linus,
[4737.60 → 4738.32] what is a product
[4738.32 → 4739.48] that you will probably
[4739.48 → 4740.68] never be able to make,
[4740.74 → 4741.90] but would like to make?
[4742.36 → 4743.04] Oh, man.
[4743.10 → 4743.32] I mean,
[4743.32 → 4744.46] there are a lot of things
[4744.46 → 4746.22] I'd love to be able to make.
[4748.42 → 4748.82] Oh.
[4750.50 → 4751.22] Oh, yeah.
[4751.42 → 4751.68] Yeah.
[4751.88 → 4752.28] Socks.
[4752.58 → 4753.00] I mean,
[4753.10 → 4753.72] we'll get it.
[4754.60 → 4756.16] We're going to nail the socks.
[4756.46 → 4757.14] Don't you worry.
[4759.42 → 4759.82] Sandals.
[4760.12 → 4761.20] Sandals may never happen.
[4761.66 → 4763.04] Just the mould costs
[4763.04 → 4764.04] for all the different sizes
[4764.04 → 4764.58] that you have to do.
[4764.64 → 4766.04] I'd love to do a better sandal.
[4766.40 → 4766.72] Like, man,
[4767.16 → 4767.68] the...
[4767.68 → 4768.04] See?
[4768.38 → 4769.84] I'm going to get all passionate again.
[4770.14 → 4770.34] Okay?
[4770.78 → 4771.92] The failure point
[4771.92 → 4773.20] on every pair of sandals
[4773.20 → 4773.86] I've ever owned
[4773.86 → 4774.50] is the same.
[4775.12 → 4776.04] So why don't you just
[4776.04 → 4777.22] reinforce it,
[4777.28 → 4777.86] you fuck?
[4778.98 → 4780.14] That's your whole job
[4780.14 → 4781.14] is to make sandals.
[4781.94 → 4782.52] So what?
[4782.56 → 4783.06] You don't know
[4783.06 → 4783.96] how they come apart?
[4784.82 → 4785.04] Like,
[4785.10 → 4786.52] how is that even possible?
[4786.68 → 4787.50] No one...
[4787.50 → 4788.16] Oh, man.
[4788.54 → 4789.24] Oh, man.
[4789.34 → 4789.62] Okay.
[4790.62 → 4791.34] Oh, man.
[4793.56 → 4794.04] Okay,
[4794.04 → 4794.66] I was trying...
[4794.66 → 4795.58] I'm trying to navigate
[4795.58 → 4796.80] to, like,
[4796.90 → 4798.04] a local rec centre
[4798.04 → 4799.02] on my way home.
[4799.40 → 4799.70] Okay?
[4800.02 → 4801.14] And I'm using my voice
[4801.14 → 4802.74] because I'm a responsible person.
[4802.74 → 4804.12] I'm operating a motor vehicle.
[4805.04 → 4806.06] So I press my button
[4806.06 → 4806.74] on my steering wheel,
[4806.82 → 4807.44] hold my button
[4807.44 → 4808.12] on my steering wheel.
[4808.20 → 4808.74] I go, okay.
[4809.40 → 4810.10] Navigate to
[4810.10 → 4811.62] whatever the name of it is.
[4811.68 → 4811.82] Now,
[4811.88 → 4812.86] I happen to have
[4812.86 → 4814.44] an entry in my address book
[4814.44 → 4815.66] that is
[4815.66 → 4817.36] some other place of business
[4817.36 → 4818.40] that starts
[4818.40 → 4819.78] with that same region.
[4820.16 → 4820.46] Okay?
[4820.68 → 4821.06] So,
[4821.20 → 4822.00] I'm not going to say
[4822.00 → 4822.84] exactly what it is.
[4822.84 → 4823.62] I don't need to disclose
[4823.62 → 4824.14] any of this.
[4824.14 → 4824.94] But, you know,
[4825.02 → 4825.56] let's say,
[4825.64 → 4826.48] say, for example,
[4826.64 → 4828.04] I was trying to go to
[4828.04 → 4831.54] Alder grove Recreation Centre
[4831.54 → 4832.92] and I also happened
[4832.92 → 4833.74] to have an entry
[4833.74 → 4836.58] for Alder grove Dental Clinic.
[4838.02 → 4839.94] Three fucking times
[4839.94 → 4840.94] in a row,
[4841.18 → 4843.18] it utterly ignored
[4843.18 → 4844.54] Recreation Centre
[4844.54 → 4846.64] and navigated me
[4846.64 → 4849.00] to the dental clinic.
[4849.52 → 4850.76] Three times,
[4851.06 → 4852.64] three times in a row!
[4852.64 → 4855.50] with all the AI shit
[4855.50 → 4856.90] that Google does
[4856.90 → 4858.88] in 2023,
[4859.54 → 4861.60] how is it fucking possible
[4861.60 → 4862.98] that when I say
[4862.98 → 4863.84] call
[4863.84 → 4865.70] Yvonne Ho,
[4866.08 → 4867.06] it says,
[4867.30 → 4868.00] I'm sorry,
[4868.26 → 4869.18] I don't have a number
[4869.18 → 4870.42] for Yvonne Home.
[4872.32 → 4873.04] Ho!
[4873.94 → 4874.58] Ho!
[4874.58 → 4874.96] Ho!
[4878.40 → 4880.04] How is it possible
[4880.04 → 4881.42] that when I say
[4881.42 → 4883.48] call Hoffman Wong,
[4883.92 → 4884.52] it says,
[4884.82 → 4885.66] I'm sorry,
[4885.84 → 4886.82] I don't have an entry
[4886.82 → 4887.54] for Hoffman.
[4889.54 → 4890.82] Sometimes it's spelled
[4890.82 → 4892.40] with two fucking N's!
[4893.86 → 4895.16] You know how I fixed it?
[4895.38 → 4896.52] I took the second N
[4896.52 → 4897.56] off the end of his name.
[4898.16 → 4899.54] How's that even possible?
[4900.26 → 4900.94] If I say
[4900.94 → 4902.24] call Jake Ivey,
[4902.70 → 4903.18] okay,
[4903.18 → 4905.94] you check!
[4906.34 → 4907.40] How many fucking
[4907.40 → 4908.96] Jake's are in my address book?
[4910.60 → 4911.40] Jake Ivey?
[4911.62 → 4912.42] Close enough!
[4913.20 → 4913.84] If I say
[4913.84 → 4914.62] call Jake Ivey,
[4914.64 → 4915.04] it works.
[4915.62 → 4915.82] Okay,
[4915.82 → 4916.66] it's the same with James.
[4917.34 → 4917.60] Right?
[4918.06 → 4918.96] Call James Strive.
[4919.46 → 4920.52] Calling James Strobe.
[4920.64 → 4920.84] No,
[4920.96 → 4921.14] no,
[4921.24 → 4921.40] no,
[4921.46 → 4921.56] no,
[4921.56 → 4921.68] no,
[4921.68 → 4922.50] I said it this way,
[4922.54 → 4923.50] you repeat after me.
[4924.02 → 4925.78] How is it even possible?
[4926.32 → 4926.72] Okay?
[4926.88 → 4927.68] Because I know
[4927.68 → 4928.30] they have it.
[4928.54 → 4929.46] I know they have
[4929.46 → 4930.16] the technology
[4930.16 → 4931.52] to take whatever
[4931.52 → 4932.38] the phonetic
[4932.38 → 4934.12] version of that
[4934.12 → 4934.70] would be,
[4935.28 → 4935.94] cash it,
[4936.42 → 4937.52] and then give you,
[4937.70 → 4938.70] and then return
[4938.70 → 4940.22] a probability match.
[4941.20 → 4942.34] Probability match.
[4942.76 → 4943.06] Okay?
[4943.24 → 4944.26] Not a perfect match.
[4944.44 → 4944.76] Fine.
[4944.92 → 4946.32] Give me the 85% one
[4946.32 → 4947.80] that's in my local storage!
[4950.50 → 4951.02] Sorry.
[4954.90 → 4955.96] What were we talking about?
[4956.72 → 4958.66] I don't remember
[4958.66 → 4959.86] what the question was.
[4960.04 → 4961.68] What kind of product
[4961.68 → 4962.84] do you want to make?
[4963.24 → 4963.50] Yeah,
[4963.62 → 4963.98] I don't know.
[4964.06 → 4965.76] How about a voice assistant
[4965.76 → 4967.28] that isn't complete dog shit?
[4967.60 → 4968.34] How about one of those?
[4969.44 → 4970.30] Could use one of those.
[4973.50 → 4973.98] Alright.
[4975.62 → 4976.64] Let's do another topic.
[4978.30 → 4978.56] Ooh!
[4979.10 → 4979.74] Intel releases
[4979.74 → 4981.60] the first 6 gigahertz CPU.
[4982.32 → 4982.90] Good for them.
[4985.82 → 4986.64] This is funny.
[4987.00 → 4987.52] Mercedes
[4987.52 → 4988.82] is going to be offering
[4988.82 → 4990.00] level 3 self-driving
[4990.00 → 4990.48] in America.
[4990.58 → 4990.88] No, no.
[4990.94 → 4991.22] I'm kidding.
[4991.28 → 4991.62] I'm kidding.
[4991.72 → 4991.96] I'm kidding.
[4992.24 → 4992.94] Poor Anthony
[4992.94 → 4994.18] put together this topic for us.
[4994.26 → 4994.56] Damn it.
[4994.58 → 4995.12] We're going to read it.
[4995.92 → 4997.30] After CEO Pat Gelsinger
[4997.30 → 4997.90] teased it
[4997.90 → 4999.48] during the Innovation 2022 keynote,
[4999.62 → 5000.28] Intel on Thursday
[5000.28 → 5001.00] formally released
[5001.00 → 5002.58] the i9-13900KS.
[5003.32 → 5004.06] It is binned,
[5004.14 → 5004.42] apparently,
[5004.56 → 5005.30] through a unique
[5005.30 → 5006.48] selection process.
[5007.00 → 5007.24] So,
[5008.26 → 5008.54] binning.
[5008.90 → 5009.84] It has the same
[5009.84 → 5010.84] core and cache layout,
[5010.94 → 5011.76] but with higher base
[5011.76 → 5012.50] and boost clocks.
[5012.50 → 5013.22] It is apparently
[5013.22 → 5015.58] a world's first
[5015.58 → 5017.46] 6 gigahertz CPU.
[5017.64 → 5018.94] This is versus 5.8
[5018.94 → 5021.10] for the non-S version of it.
[5022.70 → 5023.68] It's E course
[5023.68 → 5024.72] boosts the same, though.
[5024.76 → 5025.78] So, it's only the P course
[5025.78 → 5026.54] that will boost higher,
[5026.62 → 5027.08] which is fine
[5027.08 → 5028.20] because from a gaming standpoint,
[5028.40 → 5029.64] that's all you really need.
[5030.22 → 5031.10] Hardware Unboxed
[5031.10 → 5031.66] got their hands
[5031.66 → 5032.20] on the new chip
[5032.20 → 5033.32] and released a review
[5033.32 → 5034.06] at launch.
[5034.30 → 5034.74] Unsurprisingly,
[5035.14 → 5035.82] they're fast.
[5036.58 → 5036.86] Yep,
[5037.08 → 5037.74] they're fast.
[5037.90 → 5038.56] They're at the top
[5038.56 → 5039.24] of the graph.
[5040.02 → 5041.16] There's a slight problem,
[5041.24 → 5041.44] though.
[5041.82 → 5043.00] Aside from the whopping
[5043.00 → 5044.98] 280 watts of power
[5044.98 → 5046.68] that it drew
[5046.68 → 5048.76] at its 5.5 gigahertz
[5048.76 → 5049.58] all-core frequency,
[5049.80 → 5050.16] wow.
[5051.08 → 5051.52] Okay.
[5053.18 → 5054.32] It's really expensive.
[5054.62 → 5055.80] It's $100 more
[5055.80 → 5056.38] than the CPU
[5056.38 → 5057.08] it's based on.
[5057.20 → 5058.80] That's 17% more
[5058.80 → 5060.10] for about 3%
[5060.10 → 5061.04] better performance.
[5061.38 → 5062.80] And this does not
[5062.80 → 5063.94] factor in AMD,
[5064.34 → 5066.52] whose $400 7700X
[5066.52 → 5067.46] isn't that far off
[5067.46 → 5068.16] in gaming.
[5069.52 → 5070.84] To get the best gains
[5070.84 → 5071.90] out of the 1300KS,
[5072.16 → 5073.02] it goes without saying
[5073.02 → 5073.50] that you will need
[5073.50 → 5074.26] to also spend
[5074.26 → 5074.86] a bunch of money.
[5075.52 → 5075.92] Like,
[5075.96 → 5077.26] you'll need fast DDR5
[5077.26 → 5078.34] 7200 memory.
[5078.46 → 5079.12] That gained
[5079.12 → 5080.42] an additional 3% FPS,
[5081.08 → 5082.30] though that might apply
[5082.30 → 5083.58] to the 1300K as well.
[5083.76 → 5084.76] So, the question becomes,
[5084.92 → 5085.82] if I really need
[5085.82 → 5087.22] 3% more performance,
[5087.68 → 5089.62] are there other ways
[5089.62 → 5090.10] to do it?
[5090.14 → 5090.36] Maybe.
[5090.86 → 5091.42] And then do I need
[5091.42 → 5092.12] another 3%?
[5092.30 → 5093.26] Let's fucking go!
[5094.56 → 5095.72] Let's get the KFs!
[5096.52 → 5098.52] Um...
[5098.52 → 5101.02] Yeah, I mean,
[5101.14 → 5102.20] Luke's got a good point.
[5103.54 → 5103.78] You know,
[5103.96 → 5104.76] he thought it would
[5104.76 → 5105.42] actually be more
[5105.42 → 5106.40] than $100 more.
[5106.88 → 5107.86] Very few of these
[5107.86 → 5108.88] things will probably exist.
[5109.26 → 5110.32] And going back to,
[5110.40 → 5110.66] you know,
[5110.76 → 5110.98] like,
[5111.10 → 5112.54] third-party binning services
[5112.54 → 5113.50] like Silicon Lottery
[5113.50 → 5114.42] back when they existed,
[5115.02 → 5116.20] these highly binned chips
[5116.20 → 5117.10] would often cost
[5117.10 → 5118.20] a lot more.
[5118.84 → 5119.14] So,
[5119.34 → 5120.72] from that point of view,
[5121.06 → 5121.84] you're probably right.
[5121.84 → 5123.02] It's downright reasonable.
[5123.32 → 5124.22] Because you have to
[5124.22 → 5125.62] understand what you're buying.
[5125.62 → 5126.86] You are buying
[5126.86 → 5128.36] essentially hand-picked
[5128.36 → 5129.34] silicon.
[5130.12 → 5131.62] Maybe not by an actual hand,
[5131.70 → 5133.12] but certainly a robot hand.
[5135.16 → 5136.26] Certain things that
[5136.26 → 5137.00] you'd really prefer
[5137.00 → 5137.92] a human hand to do.
[5137.96 → 5138.84] But I think robot hand
[5138.84 → 5139.66] is good enough for this.
[5139.70 → 5140.24] You know what I'm saying?
[5140.86 → 5141.44] You know what I'm saying,
[5141.52 → 5142.02] Silent Luke?
[5144.56 → 5144.96] Yeah,
[5145.06 → 5145.46] I should have waited
[5145.46 → 5146.02] for him to drink.
[5147.48 → 5148.32] I want to get
[5148.32 → 5149.28] that computer wet.
[5149.70 → 5150.90] And computers love me.
[5150.90 → 5151.68] I turn them on.
[5151.68 → 5155.56] I'm sorry.
[5155.64 → 5156.20] I really shouldn't
[5156.20 → 5157.04] be making him laugh.
[5157.12 → 5157.60] For those of you
[5157.60 → 5158.04] who are wondering
[5158.04 → 5159.28] what the fuck is going on
[5159.28 → 5160.00] with the WAN show,
[5160.48 → 5162.58] we are doing a little
[5162.58 → 5164.30] Jay and Silent Bob cosplay
[5164.30 → 5166.36] because Luke had
[5166.36 → 5167.92] some fairly significant
[5167.92 → 5168.76] oral surgery
[5168.76 → 5169.92] earlier this week.
[5170.26 → 5173.50] He cannot really speak
[5173.50 → 5174.40] comfortably,
[5174.76 → 5175.94] but we've got a bit
[5175.94 → 5176.76] of a streak going.
[5177.14 → 5178.00] We've got to figure out
[5178.00 → 5179.04] exactly which was
[5179.04 → 5180.04] the first show
[5180.04 → 5182.46] that we did.
[5183.78 → 5184.54] Or not the first show
[5184.54 → 5184.80] we did,
[5184.84 → 5185.68] but we've got to figure out
[5185.68 → 5187.12] how far back we have to go
[5187.12 → 5188.40] before it was not
[5188.40 → 5190.12] me and Luke
[5190.12 → 5191.02] on the WAN show.
[5191.22 → 5192.00] I'm pretty sure
[5192.00 → 5193.00] we're over two years
[5193.00 → 5193.48] at this point
[5193.48 → 5194.40] where neither of us
[5194.40 → 5195.34] has missed a WAN show
[5195.34 → 5197.00] regardless of
[5197.00 → 5198.32] work trips,
[5198.74 → 5199.86] family vacations,
[5200.70 → 5201.98] statutory holidays,
[5202.88 → 5203.40] surgery.
[5203.40 → 5206.96] And in the interest
[5206.96 → 5207.88] of keeping the streak
[5207.88 → 5208.36] alive,
[5209.04 → 5209.70] Luke actually
[5209.70 → 5211.02] scheduled his procedure
[5211.02 → 5213.26] as far away as possible
[5213.26 → 5214.78] from WAN show
[5214.78 → 5216.90] and had intended
[5216.90 → 5217.88] to be on the show
[5217.88 → 5218.64] today talking
[5218.64 → 5220.04] but has had some
[5220.04 → 5221.04] complications today
[5221.04 → 5221.92] that prevented him
[5221.92 → 5223.46] from fully participating.
[5224.02 → 5225.16] So I don't remember
[5225.16 → 5226.16] whose idea it was,
[5226.30 → 5226.94] but we came up
[5226.94 → 5227.64] with the idea
[5227.64 → 5228.52] of okay,
[5228.88 → 5229.50] well if you're gonna,
[5229.86 → 5230.44] was this me?
[5230.66 → 5230.74] Okay,
[5230.94 → 5231.96] sometimes I have
[5231.96 → 5233.24] stupid fucking ideas.
[5233.72 → 5234.62] So we came up
[5234.62 → 5235.36] with the idea
[5235.36 → 5236.56] of cosplaying
[5236.56 → 5237.72] as Jay and Silent Bob
[5237.72 → 5238.48] so there would be
[5238.48 → 5239.74] a reason for
[5239.74 → 5241.06] him to be silent
[5241.06 → 5242.42] and then this topic
[5242.42 → 5243.62] with YouTube
[5243.62 → 5244.86] demonetizing channels
[5244.86 → 5246.10] for swearing excessively
[5246.10 → 5247.88] kind of was perfect
[5247.88 → 5249.06] because I needed
[5249.06 → 5250.00] an excuse to talk
[5250.00 → 5250.92] about fucking pussy
[5250.92 → 5252.26] and right?
[5252.42 → 5252.60] Like,
[5253.78 → 5255.16] if I'm going to be
[5255.16 → 5255.76] the character of what?
[5255.80 → 5256.10] I'm gonna,
[5256.16 → 5256.66] I'm gonna,
[5256.94 → 5257.62] like,
[5257.78 → 5258.46] bleep things?
[5259.42 → 5260.48] Can't do that shit?
[5261.78 → 5262.02] Uh,
[5262.10 → 5262.66] anyway.
[5264.12 → 5264.94] Intel has dreamed
[5264.94 → 5266.06] of speeds of 6 gigahertz
[5266.06 → 5267.10] for 20 years
[5267.10 → 5268.06] with their last
[5268.06 → 5268.78] serious attempt
[5268.78 → 5269.98] being the Pentium 4
[5269.98 → 5271.12] net burst architecture
[5271.12 → 5272.06] derived Texas.
[5272.52 → 5272.88] Texas?
[5273.10 → 5273.82] I forget how to pronounce
[5273.82 → 5274.22] Texas.
[5274.84 → 5275.22] Um,
[5275.42 → 5276.42] but the Pentium,
[5276.62 → 5277.44] Pentium 5.
[5277.86 → 5278.04] Uh,
[5278.04 → 5279.04] these chips were intended
[5279.04 → 5280.38] to push past 5 gigahertz
[5280.38 → 5281.10] to an ultimate goal
[5281.10 → 5282.44] of 10 gigahertz plus,
[5282.60 → 5283.42] but they just
[5283.42 → 5284.48] couldn't do it
[5284.48 → 5285.56] and Texas was canned
[5285.56 → 5286.32] by 2004
[5286.32 → 5286.88] in favour
[5286.88 → 5288.48] of the lower clocked
[5288.48 → 5289.54] Pentium M-based
[5289.54 → 5290.42] core CPUs.
[5291.42 → 5292.52] Gigahertz doesn't matter
[5292.52 → 5293.52] came true.
[5294.14 → 5294.54] Um,
[5294.54 → 5295.78] as we reach the limits
[5295.78 → 5296.50] of simply adding
[5296.50 → 5297.14] more cores
[5297.14 → 5298.04] and with both teams
[5298.04 → 5299.14] pushing clocks again
[5299.14 → 5299.54] instead,
[5299.92 → 5300.46] might gigahertz
[5300.46 → 5301.28] matter once more?
[5301.76 → 5302.88] The answer is
[5302.88 → 5304.16] they always will.
[5304.28 → 5304.88] They always have
[5304.88 → 5305.80] and they always will.
[5306.92 → 5308.22] All else being equal,
[5308.68 → 5309.30] more gigahertz
[5309.30 → 5310.18] is faster.
[5310.86 → 5312.00] But the thing is
[5312.00 → 5313.66] that a lot of efficiencies
[5313.66 → 5314.36] were gained
[5314.36 → 5315.68] by building a more,
[5315.84 → 5316.74] um,
[5317.20 → 5318.98] a more power efficient
[5318.98 → 5319.90] architecture,
[5320.08 → 5320.96] especially as we moved
[5320.96 → 5322.24] into the multicore era,
[5322.76 → 5323.60] such that
[5323.60 → 5325.68] gigahertz was not
[5325.68 → 5327.00] the only answer
[5327.00 → 5327.90] to the problem.
[5328.38 → 5328.78] So,
[5329.28 → 5330.38] I think there's always
[5330.38 → 5331.28] going to be a little bit
[5331.28 → 5332.46] of ebb and flow.
[5332.56 → 5333.60] Are we chasing gigahertz
[5333.60 → 5334.30] or are we chasing
[5334.30 → 5335.52] architectural efficiencies?
[5336.10 → 5336.30] Uh,
[5336.30 → 5336.74] realistically,
[5337.30 → 5338.72] for a long time,
[5338.76 → 5339.64] it's just kind of been
[5339.64 → 5340.50] a little bit of both.
[5342.22 → 5343.02] Discussion question
[5343.02 → 5343.34] is,
[5343.44 → 5344.10] what direction do you see
[5344.10 → 5344.92] the industry going
[5344.92 → 5346.00] and following this milestone?
[5346.18 → 5346.76] More clock speed,
[5346.82 → 5347.16] more cache,
[5347.24 → 5347.58] more cores,
[5347.64 → 5348.02] more power,
[5348.08 → 5348.66] or something else?
[5349.46 → 5349.80] Uh,
[5349.80 → 5350.84] I don't think we can really
[5350.84 → 5351.84] push power much higher,
[5351.94 → 5353.30] at least not for monolithic dyes.
[5353.72 → 5354.04] Um,
[5354.04 → 5355.62] we saw with AMD's release
[5355.62 → 5358.00] of the non-X7000 series CPUs
[5358.00 → 5361.86] that at even pretty high power draw,
[5362.12 → 5363.02] a chaplet design,
[5363.40 → 5365.48] spreading out that,
[5365.56 → 5365.82] uh,
[5365.86 → 5366.88] that power dissipation
[5366.88 → 5367.90] helps a lot
[5367.90 → 5368.74] with thermal management.
[5368.88 → 5368.98] Like,
[5369.06 → 5369.18] yeah,
[5369.18 → 5370.10] it's still a ton of heat,
[5370.24 → 5371.72] you still need a big fat heat sink,
[5371.84 → 5372.76] but you're not going to have
[5372.76 → 5373.60] these hot spots
[5373.60 → 5375.20] that are absolutely going to kill
[5375.20 → 5376.70] any attempt to cool these things.
[5377.14 → 5377.32] Like,
[5377.36 → 5377.86] that's the thing,
[5377.90 → 5378.08] right,
[5378.30 → 5379.26] is you could have
[5379.26 → 5380.68] a 100 watt chip,
[5381.22 → 5381.48] right,
[5381.64 → 5383.34] that is impossible to cool
[5383.34 → 5385.84] because the die is so small
[5385.84 → 5387.02] that the physics
[5387.02 → 5388.20] of moving the heat away
[5388.20 → 5389.04] from it fast enough
[5389.04 → 5389.76] are impossible,
[5390.34 → 5390.60] right?
[5390.84 → 5391.28] Or,
[5391.58 → 5393.44] you could have a 400 watt chip
[5393.44 → 5394.06] in a server
[5394.06 → 5395.64] that's this fucking big,
[5395.86 → 5396.52] has chaplets
[5396.52 → 5397.70] all over the damn thing,
[5397.70 → 5398.28] and yeah,
[5398.34 → 5399.30] you need a big heat sink
[5399.30 → 5399.94] on that bitch,
[5400.02 → 5400.48] but like,
[5400.68 → 5406.50] but it's not a problem
[5406.50 → 5407.46] to get the heat
[5407.46 → 5408.48] out of the chip
[5408.48 → 5409.84] into that heat sink.
[5411.12 → 5411.56] So,
[5411.84 → 5412.38] I don't see us
[5412.38 → 5413.78] pushing power much higher
[5413.78 → 5414.76] for desktop chips
[5414.76 → 5415.12] where,
[5415.48 → 5416.10] realistically,
[5416.36 → 5417.36] wafers are going up
[5417.36 → 5417.76] in price,
[5417.82 → 5418.36] not down,
[5418.54 → 5419.48] and we're not going to see
[5419.48 → 5421.08] significantly larger dies.
[5421.44 → 5421.68] So,
[5421.76 → 5422.90] we've just reached a point
[5422.90 → 5424.00] where we can't really move heat.
[5424.00 → 5424.24] I mean,
[5424.48 → 5425.80] Intel's already thinning out,
[5425.86 → 5426.82] not just the IHS,
[5427.42 → 5428.66] they've been thinning the die
[5428.66 → 5430.52] for multiple generations now
[5430.52 → 5431.58] to try to get heat out of it
[5431.58 → 5432.14] more efficiently.
[5432.36 → 5432.46] Like,
[5432.76 → 5435.16] we are at the razor's edge
[5435.16 → 5436.36] of what's possible now.
[5438.40 → 5439.64] I do see them,
[5439.64 → 5440.86] I do see them continuing
[5440.86 → 5441.92] to try to push clock speed
[5441.92 → 5442.70] as much as they can,
[5442.76 → 5443.44] but it's hard to do
[5443.44 → 5444.24] without more power.
[5444.46 → 5444.58] So,
[5445.84 → 5446.14] man,
[5446.22 → 5446.56] what are you,
[5446.56 → 5447.80] what are you going to see?
[5448.24 → 5449.64] More cash is going to be tough.
[5450.64 → 5451.86] I'm sounding like,
[5451.86 → 5452.70] I'm sounding like,
[5452.84 → 5454.54] like a bad news bearer here.
[5455.06 → 5456.32] More cash is going to be tough.
[5456.42 → 5458.00] We've seen news coming out of TSMC
[5458.00 → 5459.70] that the latest node shrinks
[5459.70 → 5462.96] are not really making cash
[5462.96 → 5463.56] any smaller,
[5464.06 → 5464.58] which is,
[5464.68 → 5468.96] pretty tough for AMD's strategy
[5468.96 → 5469.96] of throwing more cash
[5469.96 → 5470.42] at their chips
[5470.42 → 5471.40] to dramatically boost
[5471.40 → 5472.16] gaming performance.
[5472.56 → 5473.76] I think the X3Ds
[5473.76 → 5474.44] of this generation
[5474.44 → 5475.16] are going to be pretty
[5475.16 → 5475.96] freaking expensive.
[5476.56 → 5477.32] AMD's going to be able
[5477.32 → 5478.46] to point at their nonces
[5478.46 → 5478.72] and say,
[5478.82 → 5478.86] hey,
[5478.92 → 5480.24] we're still a great value,
[5480.72 → 5480.90] right?
[5480.90 → 5482.44] AM5 is a great platform,
[5482.58 → 5483.18] great value,
[5483.38 → 5485.18] but you want to go fucking fast.
[5485.24 → 5485.74] You're going to have to pay
[5485.74 → 5486.46] some fucking money.
[5486.54 → 5487.08] You know what I'm saying?
[5490.98 → 5491.58] I mean,
[5491.82 → 5492.50] I think,
[5492.56 → 5493.32] I think Luke,
[5493.42 → 5494.10] Luke's right.
[5494.22 → 5495.58] Chaplets are 100% the future,
[5495.84 → 5497.80] but I mean,
[5497.86 → 5498.08] what?
[5498.20 → 5499.52] Do you really want more cores?
[5500.26 → 5500.66] I mean,
[5501.22 → 5501.66] yeah,
[5501.66 → 5502.88] your team works in development.
[5502.98 → 5504.06] You're going to parallelize everything.
[5504.14 → 5504.90] Good fucking luck.
[5510.90 → 5512.38] Ultimately,
[5513.38 → 5514.54] single core,
[5514.62 → 5514.76] yeah,
[5514.82 → 5515.52] single core performance
[5515.52 → 5516.14] is always going to matter.
[5517.98 → 5518.34] Yeah,
[5518.64 → 5519.58] it's always going to matter.
[5520.32 → 5521.10] And it's still,
[5521.14 → 5522.36] it's still a bottleneck today.
[5522.60 → 5522.98] Like,
[5523.04 → 5523.32] no matter,
[5523.50 → 5524.40] no matter what you're doing,
[5524.52 → 5525.54] it still matters.
[5527.38 → 5527.88] All right,
[5527.96 → 5529.42] let's move on to our,
[5530.18 → 5530.44] oh,
[5530.58 → 5531.14] this is,
[5531.24 → 5531.38] oh,
[5531.40 → 5532.08] this is a big topic.
[5532.32 → 5533.20] Praise St. Cook,
[5533.38 → 5534.18] hero of the people.
[5534.72 → 5535.84] Tim Cook voluntarily
[5535.84 → 5537.38] takes a 40% pay cut.
[5537.38 → 5538.62] On Thursday,
[5538.76 → 5540.48] Apple announced that CEO Tim Cook
[5540.48 → 5542.34] would be taking a 40% pay cut
[5542.34 → 5545.50] going from $84 million last year
[5545.50 → 5548.44] to just $49 million this year.
[5550.40 → 5550.84] Okay,
[5550.96 → 5552.38] I don't really know if I like your attitude.
[5552.54 → 5554.10] This is some pretty sad shit right here.
[5557.58 → 5558.66] How's Tim Cook's family
[5558.66 → 5560.04] going to have generational wealth now?
[5563.44 → 5564.82] This decision was made
[5564.82 → 5566.92] after the company's board committee
[5566.92 → 5568.32] I mean,
[5568.36 → 5569.82] it doesn't sound like an excited committee.
[5569.92 → 5571.02] I guess they get to talk about
[5571.02 → 5571.80] how much more money
[5571.80 → 5572.84] Tim Cook makes than them.
[5576.04 → 5577.38] The decision was made
[5577.38 → 5579.02] after the company's board committee
[5579.02 → 5580.32] on executive compensation
[5580.32 → 5582.96] balanced shareholder feedback,
[5583.78 → 5585.38] Apple's exceptional performance,
[5585.64 → 5587.92] and a recommendation from Mr. Cook,
[5588.02 → 5588.26] okay,
[5588.36 → 5588.82] for real though,
[5589.16 → 5590.64] to adjust his compensation
[5590.64 → 5592.08] in light of feedback received.
[5592.62 → 5594.42] Tim's annual basic salary
[5594.42 → 5595.54] will remain $3 million
[5595.54 → 5597.40] with a bonus of up to $6 million.
[5598.26 → 5599.08] What's changing
[5599.08 → 5600.62] is his stock award target
[5600.62 → 5601.86] which will be cut to $40 million
[5601.86 → 5603.46] as opposed to the $75 million
[5603.46 → 5604.76] that he received last year.
[5605.52 → 5606.12] Last year,
[5606.18 → 5607.34] Apple apparently wanted to pay Cook
[5607.34 → 5609.86] a $99 million pay package,
[5610.20 → 5611.76] but shareholder advisory firm
[5611.76 → 5613.42] ISS said it was
[5613.42 → 5614.48] too much.
[5617.30 → 5618.60] This is very interesting.
[5618.78 → 5618.90] Like,
[5618.96 → 5620.22] once you get into these numbers
[5620.22 → 5621.76] that are just so far beyond
[5621.76 → 5624.00] like any reasonable amount of money,
[5624.44 → 5624.80] like,
[5624.88 → 5625.06] okay,
[5625.14 → 5625.74] tell me something,
[5625.86 → 5626.04] Luke.
[5626.34 → 5626.52] Okay,
[5626.56 → 5628.22] what does this work out to?
[5628.26 → 5628.68] Even now,
[5628.76 → 5630.20] $49 million a year,
[5630.30 → 5631.10] so that works out to
[5631.10 → 5633.12] a seventh of a million dollars a day.
[5633.34 → 5633.74] So,
[5633.92 → 5636.48] about $130 million a day,
[5636.68 → 5636.88] alright?
[5637.92 → 5638.12] Alright,
[5638.22 → 5638.78] $1,000,
[5638.86 → 5639.34] sorry,
[5639.34 → 5639.72] excuse me,
[5639.76 → 5641.44] $130,000 a day.
[5643.76 → 5644.20] Yeah,
[5644.28 → 5645.56] can we become a shareholder firm
[5645.56 → 5646.46] that says too much?
[5646.80 → 5647.20] Yeah,
[5647.48 → 5648.64] advisory firm?
[5648.74 → 5648.88] Okay,
[5649.32 → 5650.68] so $130,000 a day.
[5650.76 → 5650.98] Luke,
[5651.52 → 5652.38] could you spend
[5652.38 → 5652.86] 100,
[5652.98 → 5653.84] what does that work out to
[5653.84 → 5655.32] per waking hour?
[5655.80 → 5656.02] So,
[5656.12 → 5657.10] so you're awake for what?
[5657.18 → 5658.42] Let's say 16 hours,
[5658.50 → 5658.74] okay?
[5659.14 → 5659.44] So,
[5659.68 → 5660.48] you make
[5660.48 → 5663.68] about $8,000
[5663.68 → 5664.88] a waking hour.
[5665.64 → 5666.04] Oh,
[5666.16 → 5666.36] man,
[5666.46 → 5667.10] that was pretty close.
[5668.20 → 5668.60] Nice.
[5668.98 → 5669.20] Okay,
[5669.20 → 5670.76] you make $8,000 an hour.
[5671.12 → 5672.28] Could you spend
[5672.28 → 5675.20] $80 in a minute?
[5678.48 → 5680.46] Could you spend $80 every minute?
[5680.56 → 5680.66] Like,
[5680.70 → 5681.40] what kind of food,
[5681.50 → 5682.52] what kind of fucking food
[5682.52 → 5683.04] would you eat?
[5684.18 → 5684.34] Like,
[5684.36 → 5684.60] how long,
[5684.78 → 5686.92] at the rate that you eat,
[5687.32 → 5687.90] my God,
[5687.98 → 5688.68] you could never,
[5689.88 → 5692.92] he could eat forever
[5692.92 → 5694.24] on that amount of money.
[5694.58 → 5694.84] He could,
[5694.94 → 5695.24] I mean,
[5695.24 → 5696.22] this fucking guy
[5696.22 → 5696.88] could eat forever
[5696.88 → 5697.50] on like,
[5698.16 → 5699.18] a thousandth of that,
[5699.52 → 5701.40] a 100,000th of that.
[5701.48 → 5701.68] God,
[5701.70 → 5702.40] you eat so slow.
[5702.90 → 5703.08] It's amazing.
[5703.12 → 5704.00] You'd think he wouldn't be able
[5704.00 → 5704.92] to get as big as he is.
[5704.92 → 5710.64] Oh,
[5710.84 → 5711.56] oh,
[5711.56 → 5711.96] wow,
[5712.12 → 5712.34] yeah,
[5712.42 → 5712.88] you're going to be
[5712.88 → 5714.18] pretty slow at eating now.
[5714.70 → 5715.62] Unless you're eating that pussy.
[5717.44 → 5717.84] Look,
[5717.92 → 5719.12] I'm supposed to be Jay,
[5719.18 → 5719.42] right?
[5719.78 → 5720.72] That's what he would say.
[5722.56 → 5723.60] Gets right into it.
[5723.60 → 5734.56] I'm actually hurting him.
[5735.22 → 5736.42] I'm sorry.
[5739.66 → 5740.48] Anywho,
[5741.34 → 5742.10] I want to,
[5742.10 → 5742.66] I want to,
[5742.70 → 5743.70] I want to make it clear.
[5743.82 → 5744.50] We actually,
[5744.50 → 5745.58] um,
[5745.66 → 5746.80] did praise,
[5746.80 → 5747.50] uh,
[5747.54 → 5748.94] the late CEO of Nintendo
[5748.94 → 5751.32] for taking a 50% pay cut,
[5751.32 → 5751.84] uh,
[5751.84 → 5752.98] after the lukewarm launch
[5752.98 → 5753.52] of the 3DS
[5753.52 → 5754.22] and the failure
[5754.22 → 5754.98] of the Wii U.
[5755.56 → 5755.96] Um,
[5757.02 → 5758.22] right?
[5758.32 → 5758.68] Like that,
[5758.76 → 5759.46] it is actually
[5759.46 → 5760.48] a pretty cool thing
[5760.48 → 5761.32] for a CEO
[5761.32 → 5762.20] to take a pay cut
[5762.20 → 5762.80] when the company
[5762.80 → 5763.64] doesn't perform well
[5763.64 → 5764.10] because
[5764.10 → 5766.28] why should,
[5766.46 → 5767.48] why should other people's
[5767.48 → 5768.16] jobs get cut?
[5768.22 → 5768.96] Like that stupid,
[5769.18 → 5770.36] sad CEO
[5770.36 → 5771.12] talking about,
[5771.18 → 5772.06] like crying about
[5772.06 → 5773.02] how hard it was
[5773.02 → 5774.16] to lay people off.
[5776.18 → 5776.90] Crocodile tears,
[5777.02 → 5777.14] right?
[5777.22 → 5777.60] Like how,
[5777.70 → 5778.60] how much are you going to cry
[5778.60 → 5779.46] when it's your family
[5779.46 → 5780.18] that's worried about
[5780.18 → 5780.96] where their next meal
[5780.96 → 5781.64] is going to come from?
[5782.22 → 5782.50] Um,
[5782.50 → 5783.18] and to be clear,
[5783.18 → 5783.94] I'm not saying
[5783.94 → 5785.60] that I'm some kind of like,
[5785.86 → 5786.10] you know,
[5786.20 → 5786.60] softy,
[5786.64 → 5787.22] I would never,
[5787.42 → 5787.72] you know,
[5787.78 → 5788.36] fire anyone.
[5788.36 → 5788.84] Like that,
[5788.94 → 5789.56] that happens.
[5789.62 → 5790.38] That's business.
[5790.70 → 5791.18] But,
[5791.42 → 5791.82] you know,
[5792.20 → 5795.06] when you're doing it
[5795.06 → 5796.38] because the company
[5796.38 → 5798.24] overall didn't perform,
[5798.76 → 5799.10] well,
[5799.16 → 5800.02] shit rolls up a hill.
[5800.38 → 5800.92] Like,
[5801.02 → 5802.30] the executive team
[5802.30 → 5803.40] has to,
[5803.50 → 5804.64] has to take accountability
[5804.64 → 5805.28] for that,
[5805.50 → 5805.90] right?
[5806.56 → 5806.94] Um,
[5806.94 → 5808.06] the difference
[5808.06 → 5808.76] is that
[5808.76 → 5809.96] IATA's basic
[5809.96 → 5810.82] annual salary
[5810.82 → 5812.48] was $770,000
[5812.48 → 5813.60] with up to
[5813.60 → 5814.64] 2.11 million
[5814.64 → 5815.96] of performance-based bonuses.
[5816.96 → 5817.52] Um,
[5817.86 → 5818.44] it wasn't
[5818.44 → 5820.38] $3 million
[5820.38 → 5821.50] with $6 million
[5821.50 → 5822.18] of bonuses
[5822.18 → 5822.88] and another
[5822.88 → 5824.38] $75 million
[5824.38 → 5826.24] of performance-based bonuses
[5826.24 → 5827.50] or a stock,
[5827.62 → 5827.92] stock,
[5827.98 → 5828.82] stock award target.
[5830.46 → 5830.86] Um,
[5831.90 → 5833.42] uh,
[5833.56 → 5834.98] Jacob Chao says,
[5835.06 → 5835.74] apparently internally
[5835.74 → 5836.12] at Apple,
[5836.20 → 5837.04] everyone spent the entire
[5837.04 → 5837.72] day mocking him.
[5837.86 → 5839.16] I can't validate that.
[5839.68 → 5840.12] Uh,
[5840.16 → 5840.46] you know,
[5840.48 → 5841.18] I have no idea,
[5841.52 → 5843.02] but it wouldn't surprise me.
[5843.38 → 5843.94] Like,
[5844.64 → 5847.76] anyway,
[5848.02 → 5848.38] um,
[5848.40 → 5848.74] so yeah,
[5848.74 → 5849.56] good luck with that,
[5849.66 → 5849.78] Tim.
[5850.08 → 5850.44] Um,
[5851.68 → 5852.52] hopefully your,
[5852.78 → 5853.90] hopefully your private jet
[5853.90 → 5855.02] payments don't fall behind.
[5856.24 → 5857.16] All right,
[5857.20 → 5857.90] what else we got?
[5858.50 → 5858.98] Um,
[5859.66 → 5861.42] this is an ultra-rapid-fire
[5861.42 → 5862.36] topic.
[5862.88 → 5863.18] Uh,
[5863.20 → 5864.42] the LTT Subreddit
[5864.42 → 5865.80] brought to my attention
[5865.80 → 5866.32] that,
[5866.32 → 5867.06] uh,
[5867.08 → 5868.10] Anchor was still
[5868.10 → 5869.62] using me as a spokesperson
[5869.62 → 5870.40] on their site.
[5870.78 → 5871.10] Uh,
[5871.10 → 5871.28] hey,
[5871.38 → 5872.14] thanks Subreddit.
[5872.28 → 5872.60] Um,
[5873.64 → 5873.96] you know,
[5874.52 → 5875.14] post it on the forum
[5875.14 → 5875.68] next time.
[5876.24 → 5876.72] But,
[5876.82 → 5877.10] uh,
[5877.22 → 5877.34] no,
[5877.34 → 5878.08] Subreddit's cool too.
[5878.58 → 5878.90] Uh,
[5878.90 → 5879.20] anyway,
[5879.36 → 5879.80] it's gone.
[5880.26 → 5880.60] Uh,
[5880.60 → 5881.60] we've got that all dealt with.
[5882.66 → 5883.84] So here's their site.
[5884.26 → 5884.54] Uh,
[5884.54 → 5885.10] if you guys,
[5885.14 → 5885.36] uh,
[5885.36 → 5885.98] weren't keeping up
[5885.98 → 5886.52] with the drama,
[5886.68 → 5887.38] we dropped Anchor
[5887.38 → 5888.04] as a sponsor
[5888.04 → 5889.38] after their Dufy
[5889.38 → 5891.62] sub-brand security cameras,
[5891.62 → 5892.24] uh,
[5892.24 → 5893.10] were marketed on
[5893.10 → 5894.00] big fat lies.
[5894.60 → 5895.08] Uh,
[5895.08 → 5895.40] we were,
[5895.50 → 5896.56] we were not super happy
[5896.56 → 5897.30] about the way
[5897.30 → 5898.18] that whole thing went down.
[5898.26 → 5898.36] Oh,
[5898.38 → 5898.68] that's great.
[5898.76 → 5898.90] Okay,
[5898.94 → 5900.10] so Lou just gets more.
[5901.54 → 5903.34] He just gets a wider spot,
[5903.40 → 5903.84] I guess.
[5904.52 → 5904.92] Oh,
[5905.02 → 5905.36] all right,
[5905.42 → 5905.64] cool.
[5907.96 → 5908.36] Uh,
[5908.36 → 5909.04] good stuff.
[5909.48 → 5909.96] Uh,
[5910.00 → 5910.36] all right,
[5910.38 → 5911.72] we got a couple more topics here.
[5911.72 → 5912.92] Mercedes will be offering
[5912.92 → 5914.04] level three self-driving
[5914.04 → 5914.98] in the U S
[5914.98 → 5917.20] and they will be the first
[5917.20 → 5919.26] in front of Tesla.
[5919.68 → 5919.98] Uh,
[5919.98 → 5920.52] they got approval
[5920.52 → 5921.56] from the state of Nevada
[5921.56 → 5923.28] and they will be the first
[5923.28 → 5924.84] to offer a production vehicle
[5924.84 → 5926.28] with level three driving.
[5926.68 → 5927.08] Uh,
[5927.08 → 5928.54] the jump from level two systems,
[5928.54 → 5930.08] which include Tesla's autopilot
[5930.08 → 5932.00] and Cadillac's super cruise systems
[5932.00 → 5933.70] is a substantial leap
[5933.70 → 5934.94] and includes apparently
[5934.94 → 5936.94] environmental detection capabilities
[5936.94 → 5937.78] that allow the system
[5937.78 → 5939.12] to make informed decisions
[5939.12 → 5940.62] such as accelerating
[5940.62 → 5942.52] to pass a slow moving vehicle.
[5943.12 → 5944.24] Level three systems
[5944.24 → 5945.68] to be very clear,
[5945.84 → 5947.20] still require a human driver
[5947.20 → 5947.84] to remain ready
[5947.84 → 5948.72] to take over control
[5948.72 → 5949.62] at the system's request.
[5949.82 → 5950.96] So you can't just,
[5951.32 → 5951.66] you know,
[5952.20 → 5952.50] have,
[5952.66 → 5953.82] have someone sucking your dick
[5953.82 → 5954.70] while you're behind the wheel.
[5955.28 → 5955.68] Oh,
[5955.96 → 5959.34] I mean,
[5959.44 → 5960.10] I guess you could
[5960.10 → 5961.04] as long as you're ready
[5961.04 → 5961.96] to take over control
[5961.96 → 5963.06] at the system's request.
[5963.36 → 5964.26] Just don't let it,
[5964.34 → 5965.24] just make sure it's not a
[5965.28 → 5966.48] make sure it's not a good blow job,
[5966.54 → 5967.30] not too distracting.
[5967.60 → 5967.76] Yeah,
[5968.26 → 5968.76] uh,
[5969.02 → 5970.74] so that's good.
[5970.92 → 5971.28] And,
[5971.36 → 5971.66] uh,
[5971.72 → 5972.00] anyway,
[5972.62 → 5974.60] Audi's 2019 A8 sedan
[5974.60 → 5975.40] was supposed to be
[5975.40 → 5976.44] the first production vehicle
[5976.44 → 5977.26] with level three features
[5977.26 → 5977.58] in Europe,
[5977.58 → 5978.68] but ultimately they decided
[5978.68 → 5979.86] the market and infrastructure
[5979.86 → 5981.08] wasn't ready back in 2020.
[5981.82 → 5982.26] Um,
[5982.28 → 5982.62] this is,
[5982.68 → 5983.46] this is pretty exciting.
[5983.54 → 5983.80] I still,
[5983.92 → 5984.10] man,
[5984.18 → 5984.26] I,
[5984.42 → 5988.18] my new car has some like
[5988.18 → 5988.86] assist features,
[5989.06 → 5990.90] like even like lane keep assist,
[5991.06 → 5991.54] man,
[5991.58 → 5992.44] I drive without it on.
[5992.94 → 5993.34] I just,
[5993.50 → 5994.48] I like to drive my car.
[5994.62 → 5995.22] I feel like
[5995.22 → 5996.90] I thought I was going to be
[5996.90 → 5997.60] all automation,
[5997.60 → 5998.70] all the time when it came.
[5999.34 → 6000.04] I don't know.
[6000.52 → 6001.76] I don't know if I'm not into it.
[6002.04 → 6003.06] Maybe like sometimes,
[6003.06 → 6003.78] like if I got a
[6003.86 → 6004.38] if I'm work,
[6004.44 → 6005.70] if I have to work or something,
[6005.82 → 6007.54] like sit in the backseat and work
[6007.54 → 6008.52] while the car drives itself,
[6008.56 → 6009.26] that'd be kind of cool.
[6009.26 → 6010.22] but I,
[6010.42 → 6012.38] I like to drive.
[6014.08 → 6015.26] I also have a pretty nice car.
[6016.34 → 6016.48] I,
[6016.54 → 6016.84] I'm,
[6016.88 → 6018.30] I'm actually really liking the new car.
[6018.72 → 6019.00] It's,
[6019.26 → 6019.56] I,
[6019.56 → 6019.72] I,
[6019.80 → 6020.80] I never really cared.
[6020.94 → 6021.18] I was now,
[6021.22 → 6022.32] I've never been a car guy,
[6022.32 → 6023.02] but,
[6023.12 → 6023.46] um,
[6023.92 → 6024.18] I,
[6024.22 → 6025.20] I definitely am.
[6025.30 → 6027.84] I definitely am liking the new car.
[6027.84 → 6028.96] Um,
[6029.96 → 6033.10] yeah,
[6033.48 → 6035.70] still,
[6035.92 → 6036.06] yeah,
[6036.14 → 6036.34] yeah,
[6036.50 → 6036.76] yeah,
[6036.88 → 6037.22] yeah.
[6037.70 → 6038.44] Luke likes it too.
[6040.26 → 6040.62] Uh,
[6040.74 → 6041.36] what is it?
[6041.40 → 6042.62] Not good enough for blowjobs.
[6042.76 → 6043.06] Is that,
[6043.18 → 6043.44] wait,
[6043.50 → 6045.10] where did you say that before I,
[6045.68 → 6045.90] oh,
[6045.96 → 6047.08] my car's automated driving.
[6047.16 → 6047.28] Well,
[6047.32 → 6047.48] yeah,
[6047.56 → 6047.68] no,
[6047.68 → 6048.52] it's not even close.
[6049.18 → 6050.04] Let me tell you.
[6050.04 → 6050.24] Yeah.
[6050.24 → 6056.50] I tried to give a blowjob in that car.
[6058.40 → 6059.22] It's like awful.
[6059.30 → 6060.20] The bolsters on the seat.
[6060.24 → 6061.62] I can't even reach the passenger seat.
[6067.12 → 6068.34] All right.
[6068.74 → 6069.14] Um,
[6069.24 → 6070.64] why don't we go ahead and do some,
[6070.64 → 6070.88] um,
[6070.88 → 6071.80] some merch messages here.
[6072.02 → 6072.34] Don't,
[6072.34 → 6073.06] don't say that.
[6073.24 → 6073.44] Um,
[6073.86 → 6074.18] okay.
[6074.28 → 6074.72] Oh,
[6074.74 → 6074.98] don't.
[6075.08 → 6075.22] Okay.
[6075.22 → 6075.68] That's fine.
[6075.76 → 6076.48] Then in that case,
[6076.54 → 6077.30] now we've got some jobs.
[6077.40 → 6078.06] We got some jobs.
[6078.10 → 6078.44] Let's go.
[6078.54 → 6079.02] Let's do jobs.
[6079.10 → 6079.28] Oh,
[6079.38 → 6079.66] wow.
[6079.66 → 6081.80] We have different pages for different companies.
[6081.80 → 6082.62] Now look at this.
[6083.42 → 6083.86] Okay.
[6084.20 → 6084.90] So there's,
[6085.04 → 6086.14] there are jobs,
[6086.24 → 6086.54] jobs,
[6086.64 → 6086.98] jobs,
[6087.10 → 6088.02] float plane jobs,
[6088.50 → 6089.60] a junior back end developer.
[6089.78 → 6089.98] Luke,
[6090.02 → 6091.42] you got to correct this if any of this is wrong.
[6091.46 → 6091.98] Is this all right?

[6094.22 → 6095.56] a full-time front end developer,
[6096.40 → 6098.94] a full-time machine learning slash computer vision engineer.
[6099.82 → 6100.34] Um,
[6100.64 → 6100.90] okay.
[6100.98 → 6101.74] Why work here?
[6101.84 → 6102.94] Equal opportunity statement,
[6103.18 → 6103.86] job perks.
[6104.66 → 6105.18] Um,
[6105.40 → 6105.74] hey,
[6106.14 → 6106.40] hey,
[6106.44 → 6107.18] we don't have our,
[6107.28 → 6108.34] we don't have our bloody,
[6108.46 → 6108.78] uh,
[6108.78 → 6109.12] that thing,
[6109.20 → 6110.24] the good thing that we have,
[6110.32 → 6110.50] the
[6110.50 → 6111.62] the GRSP plan.
[6112.20 → 6112.34] Okay.
[6112.34 → 6113.40] We got to get that shit in here.
[6113.54 → 6113.68] Hey,
[6113.72 → 6113.92] Dan,
[6113.98 → 6114.40] do you mind,

[6114.68 → 6116.14] just sending a message over to,
[6116.14 → 6116.38] uh,
[6116.40 → 6116.70] HR?
[6117.22 → 6117.44] Yep.
[6117.64 → 6118.04] And,
[6118.10 → 6118.20] uh,
[6118.20 → 6119.58] whoever manages this website,
[6119.58 → 6122.98] that should be really quick to put up there because of Squarespace.
[6123.92 → 6124.48] Okay.
[6124.74 → 6126.00] For creator warehouse,
[6126.00 → 6129.94] we need a full-time senior retention marketing specialist.
[6130.14 → 6130.40] Okay.
[6130.98 → 6132.04] Whatever the hell that is.
[6132.28 → 6132.56] Uh,
[6132.56 → 6134.80] full-time electronics engineer slash product designer,
[6134.94 → 6136.32] a full-time fit technician.
[6136.56 → 6137.90] Got to make more garments.
[6138.28 → 6138.62] All right.
[6138.70 → 6138.90] Cool.
[6138.98 → 6139.68] So we got that.
[6139.68 → 6140.18] And then,
[6140.26 → 6140.46] oh,
[6140.60 → 6140.82] oh,
[6140.82 → 6141.02] oh,
[6141.08 → 6141.22] uh,
[6141.22 → 6141.40] oh,
[6141.92 → 6142.18] but,
[6142.34 → 6142.52] uh,
[6142.52 → 6142.70] but,
[6142.84 → 6143.22] um,
[6143.82 → 6144.42] there we go.
[6145.22 → 6146.10] What's going on here?
[6146.78 → 6147.10] Uh,
[6147.14 → 6147.28] oh,
[6147.46 → 6148.98] are not in hiring right now,
[6149.04 → 6151.98] but they will be this year, and we'll be using the resume.
[6152.12 → 6152.30] Oh,
[6152.36 → 6152.56] okay.
[6152.62 → 6153.54] So bear that in mind.
[6153.94 → 6154.28] Uh,
[6154.28 → 6155.84] we will be hiring those positions.
[6155.84 → 6156.58] Uh,
[6156.58 → 6157.32] and honestly,
[6157.40 → 6158.28] like if it's stellar,
[6158.40 → 6160.12] I'm sure we would just make it work,
[6160.12 → 6161.18] but sometimes,
[6161.18 → 6161.56] you know,
[6161.62 → 6162.70] timing's not always perfect.
[6162.70 → 6163.14] So,
[6163.14 → 6165.14] uh,
[6165.14 → 6165.38] okay.
[6165.38 → 6168.54] And then Linus media group is looking for a full-time procurement manager,
[6168.76 → 6170.36] full-time sales supervisor,
[6170.82 → 6172.58] full-time logistics coordinator,
[6173.40 → 6174.18] full-time accountant,
[6174.82 → 6175.80] full-time bookkeeper,
[6176.36 → 6178.34] full-time video editor slash camera op,
[6178.62 → 6180.18] full-time social media coordinator,
[6180.72 → 6181.96] full-time writer slash video editor.
[6181.98 → 6184.42] Full-time production assistant.
[6185.22 → 6185.58] And,
[6185.62 → 6185.76] uh,
[6185.76 → 6185.92] yeah,
[6186.00 → 6186.32] we're,
[6186.68 → 6186.84] man,
[6186.88 → 6187.84] we're hiring a lot of positions.
[6188.34 → 6188.74] Uh,
[6188.78 → 6188.96] you want,
[6189.00 → 6189.86] you want me to look at your thing,
[6189.92 → 6190.08] right?
[6193.14 → 6193.74] It's all right.
[6195.02 → 6197.28] Also the jobs on the float plane page are not only for float plane,
[6197.34 → 6197.86] which is confusing.
[6197.94 → 6198.02] Yeah.
[6198.02 → 6200.26] I think they're just jobs that you're going to have to hire for.
[6200.66 → 6201.86] That kind of makes sense.
[6202.36 → 6203.32] Sort of not really,
[6203.40 → 6203.86] but yes,
[6204.08 → 6204.44] but no,
[6204.64 → 6205.04] but yes.
[6205.74 → 6206.10] Uh,
[6206.24 → 6206.58] anyway,
[6207.04 → 6207.72] thanks Luke.
[6208.24 → 6208.82] Good chat.
[6210.68 → 6211.20] All right.
[6211.66 → 6211.90] Oh,
[6211.98 → 6212.46] no,
[6212.46 → 6212.48] no,
[6212.52 → 6213.30] we got one more topic.
[6213.42 → 6216.56] Let's do our last big topic, and then we'll get into some good merch messages.
[6217.16 → 6220.96] You guys probably noticed we didn't promote really anything on the store today.
[6221.42 → 6221.78] Um,
[6221.98 → 6225.88] that is for us to have one more big push this weekend.
[6225.88 → 6227.92] We actually do have a couple of products that we could launch.
[6228.32 → 6228.60] Uh,
[6228.60 → 6230.40] but I talked to Nick about it.
[6230.70 → 6231.02] Um,
[6231.02 → 6231.34] Adam,
[6231.54 → 6231.70] our,
[6231.78 → 6233.50] our new customer experience,
[6233.50 → 6233.94] uh,
[6233.94 → 6234.40] supervisor,
[6234.40 → 6235.16] and we basically went,
[6235.26 → 6235.42] okay,
[6235.42 → 6235.70] look,
[6236.46 → 6240.12] let's not do a big burst of sales this weekend.
[6240.60 → 6241.08] Um,
[6241.08 → 6241.76] let's save it.
[6242.02 → 6243.68] Let's get everything completely caught up.
[6243.78 → 6248.38] Our goal for this year is to measure our customer support response times in hours.
[6248.82 → 6249.26] Um,
[6249.36 → 6250.20] not in days.
[6250.20 → 6253.68] So we're going to get everything completely cleaned up next week.
[6253.68 → 6255.28] And then next week,
[6255.34 → 6258.54] hopefully we'll have like a good promo for you guys or a big launch or something like that.
[6259.26 → 6259.62] Uh,
[6259.66 → 6259.92] all right.
[6260.18 → 6261.82] 7,900 XTX problems.
[6262.30 → 6263.46] After its release in December,
[6263.90 → 6265.64] the AMD 7,900 XTX,
[6266.00 → 6266.60] um,
[6266.72 → 6267.98] has had some issues.
[6268.10 → 6273.02] There have been a number of users reporting that it was hitting hotspot temps above 110 degrees and slowing the GPU down.
[6273.54 → 6275.30] AMD started by saying this was normal,
[6275.52 → 6280.24] but soon after they admitted that some reference cards suffered a manufacturing defect in the vapour chamber.
[6280.86 → 6282.94] AMD was then interviewed by Gordon at PC World,
[6282.94 → 6284.18] and according to Debater,
[6284.62 → 6284.80] uh,
[6284.80 → 6286.82] some questionable statements were made.
[6287.22 → 6287.94] In the interview,
[6288.04 → 6289.38] Scott Perelman from AMD said,
[6289.66 → 6290.80] is there a performance issue?
[6291.06 → 6294.00] What we found is if you throttle at 110 degrees in certain workloads,
[6294.08 → 6295.94] you can see a small performance delta.
[6298.50 → 6298.90] Hmm.
[6298.90 → 6299.90] Okay.
[6299.90 → 6300.90] Okay.
[6300.90 → 6304.44] This did not line up with Debater's testing.
[6304.44 → 6311.34] That showed that three out of four cards he tested could only dissipate 250 to 280 watts of power consistently,
[6311.58 → 6313.12] 80 watts lower than it should be,
[6313.26 → 6316.04] which can drop performance by 10 to 20%.
[6316.04 → 6317.68] Whoops.
[6317.68 → 6317.76] Oops.
[6319.08 → 6320.14] Gotta protect my voice.
[6320.28 → 6320.44] Whoops.
[6321.32 → 6324.62] The problem appears to be stemming from not enough liquid in the vapour chambers.
[6324.96 → 6328.86] What's strange is that AMD says they traced the problem to a bad batch of coolers,
[6329.02 → 6332.28] and that customers can get in touch with customer support to figure things out.
[6332.54 → 6333.88] But that doesn't really make sense,
[6334.14 → 6335.72] because if it only affected a single batch,
[6335.72 → 6339.36] it should be relatively simple to use serial numbers to figure out where those cards are
[6339.36 → 6340.60] and preemptively recall them.
[6342.40 → 6344.38] I mean, yeah.
[6345.12 → 6345.56] Yeah.
[6345.76 → 6350.52] Like, why are they relying on customers to test a $1,000 GPU to figure out if it's defective?
[6350.58 → 6351.12] Like, what are they?
[6351.18 → 6351.52] What are they?
[6351.58 → 6352.38] Your RMA department?
[6354.24 → 6357.48] This either means that the defect isn't confined to a single batch,
[6357.62 → 6359.88] or that AMD just doesn't really care,
[6360.22 → 6364.00] and as long as these GPUs don't die within the warranty period,
[6364.00 → 6365.98] they're just ultimately not going to be their problem.
[6367.44 → 6372.10] The larger problem is that AMD is super low on 7900 XTX stock,
[6372.32 → 6375.30] so only about one out of three of customers affected
[6375.30 → 6378.28] will be able to get a replacement card in the first two weeks in Germany.
[6379.14 → 6381.44] Debater recommends just taking a refund from AMD
[6381.44 → 6386.90] and buying an AIB 7900 XTX instead of waiting for AMD to replace your reference card.
[6387.22 → 6392.54] Or, if this is just kind of like, um, fucking stupid,
[6392.54 → 6395.26] you could just not buy an AMD card,
[6395.50 → 6397.62] but then you're supporting NVIDIA, who has their own problems.
[6399.32 → 6400.08] I know, right?
[6401.80 → 6405.54] There's been some speculation that GPUs have died as a result of this hotspot,
[6405.74 → 6408.66] so Debater received a broken card from a viewer to tear down,
[6408.72 → 6412.68] and you absolutely should watch the moment that he turns it on for the first time.
[6412.76 → 6414.04] Not safe for nerds.
[6414.04 → 6418.44] With the disassembly done, it looks like there was a faulty VRM,
[6418.52 → 6420.64] so the hotspot temp had nothing to do with the GPU dying.
[6421.16 → 6423.72] With a better cooler, it still would have let out the magic smoke, though.
[6424.14 → 6425.76] Some bonus not safe for nerds content,
[6425.92 → 6429.04] 6900 XTs are also appearing to be dying in large numbers,
[6429.50 → 6433.08] with one German shop receiving 48 dead GPUs.
[6433.44 → 6435.86] The picture of one of the GPUs is truly horrific.
[6437.14 → 6438.04] Hmm. Let's see.
[6438.04 → 6440.88] Yikes.
[6441.34 → 6441.58] Hmm.
[6442.22 → 6443.60] Wow, did that die just crack?
[6444.20 → 6445.32] What makes that die crack?
[6445.36 → 6446.48] Oh, it came off on the cooler.
[6447.40 → 6448.60] Why would it come off on the cooler?
[6449.54 → 6450.56] What the hell?
[6452.82 → 6453.28] Wow.
[6453.62 → 6454.10] Okay.
[6455.20 → 6455.64] Huh.
[6456.42 → 6460.60] With that said, 48 is not necessarily an enormous number.
[6460.60 → 6463.58] It just depends on how many this particular,
[6464.00 → 6466.26] uh, this particular store sold.
[6466.36 → 6466.52] Yeah.
[6468.04 → 6470.84] Some people are speculating that a driver issue caused this,
[6470.88 → 6473.56] although much like the faulty VRM GPU that Debater showed,
[6473.80 → 6478.06] um, ugh, it is possible for a driver to kill a GPU, like, for real.
[6478.38 → 6482.50] Like, a driver could potentially tell it to draw way too much power.
[6482.90 → 6487.30] Um, or it could, it could disable, uh, a thermal safety.
[6487.62 → 6488.70] You know, yeah, it's possible.
[6488.88 → 6490.90] But I, I think that's fairly unlikely.
[6491.56 → 6492.94] Um, our discussion question is,
[6493.02 → 6495.48] if you were AMD, how would you try and solve the bad vapour chamber problems?
[6495.56 → 6497.62] I mean, I mean, we had some problems with screwdrivers.
[6497.62 → 6499.14] We contacted everyone who bought one.
[6499.54 → 6501.52] Uh, we had them keep their existing driver.
[6501.66 → 6506.58] We don't serialize the screwdrivers because how, like, realistically,
[6506.78 → 6508.76] there's, there's no, there's no onboard programming.
[6509.12 → 6513.18] Like, we wouldn't have a way of actually serializing them that couldn't be,
[6513.26 → 6514.64] uh, that couldn't be forged, right?
[6514.64 → 6516.06] So what are we going to do?
[6516.10 → 6518.82] Have a different plastic mould for every stupid driver?
[6519.06 → 6520.46] What are we going to put a sticker on it?
[6520.50 → 6521.10] Like, whatever.
[6521.36 → 6522.38] We don't serialize them.
[6522.46 → 6525.92] So what we had people do was just mark the ones that we knew were bad.
[6526.22 → 6527.30] Just scratch an X.
[6527.60 → 6530.44] Send a picture to us of the scratched one so that we'd know that,
[6530.68 → 6533.06] no, that one does not have any existing,
[6533.50 → 6534.96] or does not have any remaining warranty.
[6535.06 → 6537.02] And then we sent them a brand new one that has a brand-new warranty.
[6537.76 → 6539.82] Um, that's how we would do it.
[6541.22 → 6544.14] AMD has, you know, can serialize cards though.
[6544.28 → 6548.36] So maybe they could, you know, have people return the card at least.
[6548.52 → 6551.32] And then they wouldn't be out the entire cost of the card.
[6551.40 → 6551.60] I don't know.
[6551.68 → 6553.06] Would they, would they salvage memory chips?
[6553.16 → 6553.80] Probably not even.
[6553.86 → 6558.56] They're probably just, you know, I would like to know the answer to that.
[6559.78 → 6564.96] What does happen to a legit, like, I'm not talking a customer return
[6564.96 → 6566.24] because I know where that's going to end up.
[6566.24 → 6568.04] That ends up in the open box pile, right?
[6568.46 → 6571.34] What happens to a legit dead GPU?
[6571.88 → 6573.18] Memory chip goes bad.
[6574.08 → 6575.96] Is someone remanufacturing that?
[6576.88 → 6577.62] I don't know.
[6578.26 → 6585.96] I'd be really, I'd be, I'd love to follow the journey of a legitimately dead GPU.
[6586.06 → 6587.50] Does it just go into an e-waste pile?
[6587.62 → 6588.02] I don't know.
[6588.86 → 6589.26] Probably.
[6589.88 → 6591.68] But then some of them are extremely valuable.
[6591.94 → 6596.20] Like you've got GPUs where the memory chips on them alone are worth a couple of hundred dollars, right?
[6596.88 → 6600.18] And the IT industry is notoriously stingy.
[6601.56 → 6602.68] I have no idea.
[6603.12 → 6603.30] Yeah.
[6603.42 → 6607.00] I mean, you could recycle it, but that still costs you $200, right?
[6607.12 → 6608.54] Unless someone's going to use those chips.
[6608.62 → 6610.28] But then if you use those chips, you can't sell it.
[6610.28 → 6611.24] You can't sell it as new.
[6611.58 → 6612.36] Unless you just do.
[6612.44 → 6612.76] I don't know.
[6613.04 → 6614.20] I mean, it's under a cooler.
[6614.28 → 6614.78] Who's going to know?
[6614.78 → 6618.66] All right.
[6618.96 → 6620.90] I don't think we have any LTX updates this week.
[6620.96 → 6622.22] Dan, you want to get me some merch messages?
[6622.50 → 6622.82] You ready?
[6623.14 → 6624.04] I'm finally ready.
[6624.18 → 6624.36] Yes.
[6624.46 → 6624.94] Let's do it.
[6624.94 → 6625.70] I've got one here from Joe.
[6626.34 → 6626.76] What's up, Joe?
[6627.02 → 6631.04] I've been listening to this show in podcast form for six to eight years now.
[6631.36 → 6633.32] Just so you know, at least one of us does exist.
[6633.52 → 6634.62] You're a confused man, Joe.
[6635.14 → 6636.04] You're a confused man.
[6636.04 → 6636.80] Six and eight years?
[6636.96 → 6639.10] Six and eight are two completely different numbers.
[6639.10 → 6643.44] I also play competitive Mario Kart Wii.
[6643.70 → 6645.60] What's your favourite Mario Kart game?
[6646.38 → 6647.10] Mario Kart?
[6647.78 → 6648.22] Competitively.
[6648.32 → 6648.94] God damn it, Dan.
[6651.32 → 6652.12] Mario Kart.
[6653.16 → 6654.46] It's a, Mario.
[6657.46 → 6658.18] Mario Kart.
[6658.18 → 6659.04] Still better than Chris Pratt.
[6661.26 → 6662.02] Mario Kart?
[6662.10 → 6662.98] Is that what I'm supposed to say?
[6663.26 → 6665.30] Like a British person, like I'm supposed to talk like?
[6665.32 → 6665.64] British?
[6667.18 → 6667.62] Mario.
[6667.62 → 6667.74] Mario.
[6668.42 → 6669.32] It's far more.
[6669.32 → 6669.86] Not anymore.
[6670.16 → 6670.42] Mario.
[6670.90 → 6671.56] I don't know.
[6671.74 → 6672.92] I can't do a British accent.
[6674.54 → 6675.66] My favourite, man.
[6675.84 → 6678.04] The one I probably played the most was for the DS.
[6678.84 → 6680.44] I don't even remember what that one was called.
[6681.36 → 6684.86] I think it was the one legit game I actually owned for that console.
[6685.00 → 6686.18] Everything else was on my R4.
[6686.74 → 6687.22] No, no.
[6687.28 → 6688.64] I also bought Phantom Hourglass.
[6689.16 → 6690.30] Got suckered into that one.
[6690.34 → 6691.10] What a terrible game.
[6692.54 → 6694.64] Yeah, that's probably the one that I played the most.
[6694.64 → 6696.78] And it's the only one that I ever played online.
[6697.62 → 6699.58] Um, I don't know what the fuck that is.
[6700.44 → 6701.78] I, I, uh, for you, it's eight.
[6701.82 → 6702.18] Yeah, I know.
[6702.64 → 6703.86] I mean, they, they didn't ask you.
[6705.78 → 6706.86] They knew you weren't going to answer.
[6706.96 → 6707.84] It's not like you didn't even talk.
[6709.48 → 6711.98] Um, the one I probably played second most was 64.
[6712.48 → 6715.44] So this is just, this just comes down to like what consoles I owned.
[6715.48 → 6719.32] And when I was at a time in my life, when I like had any time to do anything.
[6719.32 → 6725.90] Yeah, I'd say that, uh, I'd, I'd say my, my favourite was probably Mario Kart DS.
[6726.50 → 6727.44] Was that what it was called?
[6727.54 → 6728.16] I don't even remember.
[6729.06 → 6729.38] Yeah.
[6730.00 → 6730.36] All right.
[6730.48 → 6730.74] Hit me.
[6731.24 → 6731.42] Okay.
[6731.44 → 6733.78] If you can say If, I can say Mario.
[6734.14 → 6735.14] No, If is correct.
[6735.26 → 6736.74] Mario is dumb and bad.
[6736.74 → 6739.72] We both, we both have stuff to work on.
[6739.80 → 6740.44] This one's from Reed.
[6740.82 → 6741.18] Yeah.
[6741.18 → 6742.32] I got some stuff to work on.
[6742.40 → 6743.10] Work on this guy.
[6745.18 → 6746.04] Uh, yeah.
[6746.54 → 6751.10] Uh, when should purchasers of tickets of the cancelled LTX look out for the email, allowing
[6751.10 → 6755.12] them to rebuy the tickets they bought before the official sale of the tickets?
[6755.56 → 6760.36] Also, Luke, why don't cast seem to work on Float plane, Android app, or Chrome?
[6760.54 → 6763.06] Uh, I take your silence as you're working on it.
[6763.24 → 6766.42] Uh, if you message support, I'm sure they can help you out with that.
[6766.42 → 6766.62] Yeah.
[6766.68 → 6771.04] Message Float plane support, not LTT store support, not someone on the forum.
[6771.30 → 6772.20] Don't post on the forum.
[6772.50 → 6775.18] Message Float plane support, and they can, they can get you an answer for that.
[6775.46 → 6779.04] Um, as for the purchasers of tickets, I don't know.
[6781.56 → 6785.30] Um, I don't know if we have LTX support.
[6786.50 → 6787.92] We should at some point.
[6788.32 → 6789.72] We should figure that out.
[6790.48 → 6796.36] Uh, hey, Dan, can you send a message to Colton and Chase to figure out what,
[6796.42 → 6799.40] what the hell our plan for support for LTX is?
[6799.60 → 6801.98] Yeah, I've gotten some questions about security and things like that, too.
[6802.10 → 6804.38] I think a lot of it is just still in the works.
[6804.86 → 6809.28] Okay, yeah, but we should have somewhere that people can start submitting questions
[6809.28 → 6813.80] so that we can populate an FAQ with, you know, FAQ.
[6814.64 → 6814.92] Mm-hmm.
[6815.08 → 6815.46] Get it?
[6815.80 → 6816.16] FAQ?
[6816.26 → 6816.68] Yeah, anyway.
[6816.88 → 6819.30] The point is, we can populate it with answers to those questions.
[6819.30 → 6823.40] All right.
[6823.52 → 6824.46] I'll get you another one if you want.
[6824.70 → 6824.98] Yeah.
[6825.42 → 6825.74] Okay.
[6826.04 → 6828.42] Um, this is from Cheese Floor.
[6828.50 → 6829.66] That's a very strange first name.
[6830.02 → 6832.36] I'll be using this driver to build my home lab.
[6832.78 → 6837.98] Is there any interesting that you, is there anything interesting, uh, that you're running
[6837.98 → 6842.20] on your home server besides Plex and Home Assistant that you haven't shared?
[6842.20 → 6843.34] Uh, P.S.
[6843.86 → 6846.66] Has Creator Warehouse ever thought of designing a vest?
[6847.28 → 6851.60] Um, we, I think, I think we have a vest that we worked on at some point.
[6851.80 → 6853.96] I don't know if it's ever going to come to light.
[6854.28 → 6858.14] Um, I'm not really a vest guy, to be perfectly honest with you.
[6858.82 → 6863.68] Like, I mean, we could do a fedora, but we won't, probably.
[6864.04 → 6864.84] Unless we do.
[6864.94 → 6866.58] I mean, hmm.
[6867.30 → 6869.66] Now I kind of want to do like a rockin' fedora.
[6870.00 → 6871.90] Like a super awesome fedora.
[6872.52 → 6874.38] It's like with the finest materials.
[6875.80 → 6876.70] Oh, huh.
[6876.78 → 6879.74] I'm going to have a lot of velvet soon if you want to do a velvet fedora.
[6880.08 → 6880.94] Now I want to do it.
[6881.38 → 6883.30] Um, uh, I don't know.
[6883.34 → 6884.50] We have like a Minecraft server.
[6884.86 → 6889.20] Like a just like a survival server that we play Family Minecraft on once in a while.
[6889.54 → 6891.12] Trying to think like what else I got on there.
[6891.18 → 6892.28] Not, not too much, honestly.
[6892.38 → 6895.64] I mean, I use it as a NAS, obviously, but that's, that's about it.
[6895.64 → 6898.00] I'm not a super demanding user at home.
[6898.00 → 6902.58] Um, that's the thing about like working all the time is you don't play much.
[6902.58 → 6905.96] Like I have the coolest toys and I hardly touch them.
[6906.34 → 6908.70] Like, uh, yeah, you know, Ivan, right?
[6908.92 → 6913.38] Uh, formerly like Ivan, who used to work here was, um, he was bugging me.
[6913.44 → 6916.38] He was like, Hey, we should go like do the Sea of Sky Highway on the bikes.
[6916.38 → 6921.28] I'm like, dude, I have literally not once in my life gone for a recreational ride.
[6921.94 → 6923.66] Like nothing personal.
[6923.82 → 6926.62] I just probably won't do that.
[6926.66 → 6929.36] But like, if you want to grab lunch or whatever, that's a different question.
[6929.36 → 6931.52] Like I can probably, I can probably make that work.
[6931.64 → 6935.40] But like, I got this cool bike and I literally have only ever commuted on it.
[6935.88 → 6936.66] Like, okay.
[6937.84 → 6938.28] Oh.
[6938.28 → 6938.88] Okay.
[6940.10 → 6941.06] This one's from Michael.
[6941.38 → 6946.54] Linus slash Luke, what's your take on using blockchain technologies to help resolve monetization
[6946.54 → 6947.80] issues for creators?
[6948.08 → 6955.70] I think that it's unfortunate that blockchain technology has such a negative vibe around it
[6955.70 → 6959.60] right now because there are legitimately fascinating things that could be done with it.
[6959.60 → 6965.52] The problem is just that it's completely unregulated and has become a space where grifters and scammers
[6965.52 → 6966.90] can exploit people.
[6967.24 → 6969.94] And so that harms the reputation that it has.
[6970.40 → 6974.30] And I think harms its utility for legitimately useful purposes.
[6974.54 → 6979.60] Like I talked a little bit on a previous show about this company that had this goal of creating
[6979.60 → 6987.68] like a stock exchange essentially for creators to publicly list their companies using blockchain
[6987.68 → 6993.04] technology as the validation, the proof of ownership of shares.
[6993.04 → 7000.50] So instead of buying some fucking ape or picture or whatever, like just some bullshit, you would
[7000.50 → 7008.16] actually be buying a share legally in Linus Media Group Incorporated that could then go up
[7008.16 → 7013.38] in value with like, you know, the way that shares go up in value if Linus Media Group Incorporated,
[7013.50 → 7018.80] you know, outperforms its quarterly estimates or whatever the fuck, you know, financial shit happens.
[7018.80 → 7027.04] Um, and, uh, we would also make money from the initial offering of shares and then from any
[7027.04 → 7028.94] secondary market movement of shares.
[7028.94 → 7032.10] And like the whole thing just like kind of actually makes sense.
[7032.10 → 7034.92] And blockchain would be a great way to do that.
[7035.00 → 7036.60] But yeah, this is a great point.
[7036.70 → 7039.32] Revert in the float plane chat says kind of like torrent.
[7039.40 → 7039.56] Yeah.
[7039.64 → 7041.56] Like, like torrent technology.
[7041.56 → 7045.44] It's a super cool tech that is getting a really, terrible rep.
[7045.82 → 7051.28] Um, uh, a relative of mine, a member of my extended family, let's put it that way,
[7051.28 → 7058.58] is working for a company that is using blockchain technology to, um, to help with aerial mapping,
[7058.98 → 7059.92] which is super cool.
[7060.12 → 7067.70] So essentially what you do is you submit mapping units, like you, you record and submit map,
[7067.70 → 7069.86] uh, and you get these tokens.
[7070.00 → 7079.84] And then when people need aerial maps of that place, they, they compensate your tokens, right?
[7079.90 → 7084.50] Or, or they, they have to buy tokens that make your tokens go up in value or whatever.
[7084.58 → 7087.26] Basically there's like this, this mapping economy.
[7087.26 → 7093.12] So drone operators in their spare time can just fly around mapping shit and get compensated
[7093.12 → 7095.42] anytime anyone utilizes the mapping.
[7095.52 → 7096.58] That's so cool, right?
[7096.58 → 7102.68] But as soon as you say blockchain, people are like, oh, blockchain that.
[7102.84 → 7103.12] Right.
[7103.30 → 7103.72] No, crypto.
[7105.98 → 7108.32] No, the tokens make sense in this case, Jelly D.
[7109.04 → 7110.38] Um, why not?
[7110.86 → 7117.04] Because in this case, there is a clear reason for people to exchange real fiat currency for
[7117.04 → 7118.90] the tokens, right?
[7119.46 → 7121.92] It's, it's actually a good thing.
[7122.42 → 7123.20] Super cool.
[7123.20 → 7127.60] Um, all right.
[7127.92 → 7128.52] What else we got?
[7129.80 → 7130.06] Okay.
[7130.26 → 7132.12] Uh, got another here from, uh, Rose.
[7132.62 → 7137.26] Hey, Linus and Luke, what are some challenges you've faced when redesigning the screwdriver
[7137.26 → 7140.70] to the short version or the backpack to the slimmer version?
[7140.92 → 7141.72] Oh, hold on a second.
[7141.92 → 7142.16] Uh-oh.
[7142.22 → 7146.06] Uh, algorithm in the Twitch chat asks, why do you need a marketplace for maps when they
[7146.06 → 7148.32] can be shared freely on the internet at barely any cost?
[7152.66 → 7155.34] Because the drone operator's time is not fucking free.
[7156.16 → 7157.92] Why should it be barely any cost?
[7157.98 → 7159.32] Why don't they get compensated?
[7159.82 → 7163.70] Besides, we're not talking satellite imagery that is freely available on Google Maps.
[7163.70 → 7167.04] We're talking like 3D, like topographical maps, right?
[7167.12 → 7170.10] Like we're talking high resolution maps.
[7170.34 → 7173.80] We're like moving into the future.
[7174.00 → 7178.40] We're talking about, you know, you could invest in a drone that is capable of creating like
[7178.40 → 7180.22] super, super accurate maps.
[7180.22 → 7186.26] And anyone who needs the resolution, be it for, um, you know, I don't know, resource exploration
[7186.26 → 7191.64] or whatever it is, would have a very strong financial incentive to pay for it.
[7191.66 → 7196.20] This isn't just for like random to be like, oh, it'd be kind of cool to like to see a map of
[7196.20 → 7197.90] like this, like forest a bit here.
[7198.86 → 7200.76] That's not what, that's not what it's for.
[7201.16 → 7205.16] Uh, and anything that has a commercial purpose, right?
[7205.82 → 7207.18] You should be paid for.
[7207.18 → 7212.00] Like we, we have a very clear policy here.
[7212.00 → 7218.80] If we are going to make money on something, uh, we insist that we pay for your work, period.
[7219.28 → 7221.32] Like that's just, that's just the way it is.
[7221.38 → 7224.56] There are things that we don't make money on, and we'll never make money on.
[7224.56 → 7232.06] And we're very, very grateful to people for their, for their, their, their very, very generous
[7232.06 → 7232.72] contributions.
[7232.72 → 7236.24] I mean, someone like a Colonel Morris, for example, would really stand out to me as someone
[7236.24 → 7239.96] who's just been, been an amazing member of our community over the years.
[7240.48 → 7244.94] Um, and I, you know what?
[7244.96 → 7245.98] I think there's another exception.
[7246.24 → 7247.74] Uh, we take volunteers at LTX.
[7248.00 → 7249.46] I'll be honest with you guys though.
[7249.54 → 7254.76] If you had, everyone does it and the model is not feasible.
[7255.18 → 7257.06] It's just literally not feasible.
[7257.06 → 7259.98] If you don't take volunteers to help you run a large scale event like that.
[7259.98 → 7262.48] Um, we, like we looked at the numbers.
[7263.54 → 7265.10] It's wild.
[7265.62 → 7267.46] Um, and they are still compensated.
[7267.46 → 7269.32] So they get, I think the way that it works.
[7269.44 → 7269.54] Yeah.
[7269.54 → 7273.10] If you guys want to volunteer, I think the signups are live on LTX expo.com.
[7273.28 → 7277.84] Uh, the way it works is I think you get two days of admission, and you volunteer one of
[7277.84 → 7280.06] the days is, is how it typically works.
[7280.06 → 7285.10] And then there's also like some, like some, um, like some swag pack type stuff and stuff
[7285.10 → 7285.48] like that.
[7286.84 → 7289.24] And I got a message back from Chase about LTX.
[7289.38 → 7289.66] Oh yeah.
[7289.80 → 7292.36] Um, they're trying to set something up next week, hopefully.
[7294.20 → 7294.60] Cool.
[7295.42 → 7295.84] Okay.
[7296.84 → 7297.24] Okay.
[7297.48 → 7300.98] Um, this one's for Eric, uh, from Eric.
[7301.06 → 7301.24] Sorry.
[7301.44 → 7302.40] Oh, is this the one you read before?
[7302.60 → 7304.80] No, I think this is a different person.
[7304.84 → 7305.42] Did you read one?
[7305.68 → 7307.10] Oh, I might've read this one before.
[7307.32 → 7307.72] Yeah.
[7307.80 → 7309.16] The LTT store.com.
[7309.34 → 7309.62] Okay.
[7309.62 → 7315.08] Uh, the things that will be at LTT store.com at LTX will mostly just be like what you
[7315.08 → 7316.64] would find on LTT store.com.
[7316.94 → 7319.84] Uh, yes, we plan to have screwdrivers and or backpacks there.
[7320.32 → 7322.08] Um, glad you picked up a water bottle.
[7322.26 → 7322.36] Yeah.
[7322.44 → 7323.80] We'll, we'll definitely have more stuff there.
[7323.96 → 7328.60] It's not going to be like the LTT store.com concept that I shared before where we're going
[7328.60 → 7333.28] to have like stuff that was tested by the lab, you know, like discounted electronics or
[7333.28 → 7333.52] whatever.
[7333.68 → 7336.34] I still want to do that, but that would definitely not be at LTX.
[7337.28 → 7337.64] Okay.
[7337.80 → 7338.52] This one's from Michael.
[7338.52 → 7342.72] How many t-shirts do I need to buy to get Linus Tunis to say snooker books?
[7342.72 → 7343.16] What?
[7346.52 → 7351.52] I think that's from one of the latest silent Bob and yeah.
[7351.86 → 7352.88] Oh, okay.
[7353.08 → 7353.36] Yeah.
[7353.42 → 7357.10] See, I, I have not watched every, I talked about this in the pre-stream.
[7357.28 → 7362.50] I have, I haven't watched like every Jay and Silent Bob, uh, adjacent piece of content.
[7363.08 → 7364.60] Um, sure.
[7365.46 → 7366.74] Snooker books, I guess.
[7366.98 → 7367.48] There you go.
[7367.48 → 7367.98] I don't know what it means.
[7368.12 → 7369.20] It cost one t-shirt.
[7369.50 → 7369.82] Uh-oh.
[7369.82 → 7371.00] Is it really bad?
[7371.66 → 7372.52] I have no idea.
[7372.88 → 7373.18] Okay.
[7373.28 → 7374.28] I'm not going to worry about it.
[7374.64 → 7376.78] This is the, uh, you don't have to address it next week.
[7377.12 → 7378.54] Uh, this is from Charles.
[7378.54 → 7381.80] I'm going to blow one of my few times that I'm going to talk.
[7382.00 → 7384.12] Is it going to be out an intellectual monologue?
[7384.44 → 7385.80] Unfortunately, this time, not really.
[7385.90 → 7387.10] It's snooker bookies.
[7387.44 → 7388.90] The person typed.
[7389.54 → 7390.00] No.
[7391.42 → 7391.84] No.
[7392.20 → 7393.12] Snooker bookies.
[7393.56 → 7394.04] No.
[7394.64 → 7395.28] And that's it.
[7395.34 → 7396.02] My jaw hurts.
[7396.72 → 7397.20] Cool.
[7397.20 → 7399.48] I appreciate your sacrifice, Luke.
[7400.94 → 7402.12] Uh, this one's from Charles.
[7402.32 → 7404.80] Linus, recently newlywed in my early thirties.
[7405.18 → 7408.00] Wife only into mobile legends for gaming as of now.
[7408.42 → 7410.66] Was Yvonne into gaming when you first were together?
[7410.84 → 7413.18] And any tips slash games to introduce my wife?
[7413.64 → 7414.86] Um, she wasn't really.
[7415.00 → 7416.24] Like, she played casual games.
[7416.32 → 7418.96] Uh, one that she apparently played a lot was called Dangerous Dave.
[7419.50 → 7421.06] Um, yeah.
[7421.14 → 7422.82] I'm glad she doesn't play Dangerous Dave anymore.
[7422.82 → 7427.26] You know what I mean?
[7428.20 → 7429.40] Uh, Dave, he's dangerous.
[7429.54 → 7430.66] A lot of STDs and shit.
[7435.66 → 7443.36] Um, I would say the best way to, to get her into gaming, Yvonne, um, really enjoys playing
[7443.36 → 7443.96] co-op games.
[7444.34 → 7447.52] Uh, games like Trine, uh, Overcooked if you don't like your marriage.
[7447.52 → 7452.52] Um, she played a lot of, like, Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2 with us back in the day.
[7453.04 → 7457.52] Uh, it takes, you'll definitely have to, uh, you'll, you'll want to find things that are
[7458.12 → 7460.76] pretty forgiving for newcomers.
[7460.96 → 7466.06] And I would strongly recommend, you know, if you can, um, involve, involve her in, like,
[7466.10 → 7466.56] the squad.
[7466.94 → 7467.22] You know?
[7467.22 → 7473.70] Like, instead of having a four-man group, grab two squad members and, like, carry her.
[7474.34 → 7476.36] And, like, make it, make it fun, be supportive.
[7477.20 → 7479.90] Um, just make it fun.
[7479.98 → 7481.10] That's the most important thing.
[7481.24 → 7484.66] I think that's what a lot of people miss, is it doesn't matter what game you play.
[7485.10 → 7487.12] Uh, it matters that you make it fun.
[7487.50 → 7491.10] And make it a, uh, an experience that she'll look back on and be like, yeah, I want to try
[7491.10 → 7491.46] that again.
[7491.46 → 7496.74] Okay, got one here from Tim.
[7497.36 → 7499.12] Uh, this one's a little more interesting.
[7499.38 → 7501.34] Uh, L&L et al.
[7501.78 → 7502.88] Love the show and channel.
[7502.98 → 7508.64] Curious to hear your opinions on private companies being treated as infrastructure, e.g.
[7508.72 → 7509.92] Google, YouTube, Facebook.
[7510.20 → 7512.72] And should they be government regulated?
[7513.08 → 7515.88] Also, what would happen if one of them just shut down overnight?
[7516.42 → 7516.70] Cheers.
[7517.00 → 7518.44] Yeah, we're in a dangerous place.
[7518.44 → 7525.12] I mean, that, uh, this is a problem that's been developing for a long time.
[7525.20 → 7531.02] I mean, I, I remember, man, back in the day, I forget, I forget who it was, but I watched
[7531.02 → 7538.48] a really cool video about the, the way that, um, U.S. telcos essentially took government money,
[7538.56 → 7544.44] took public money to build out a ton of infrastructure, just completely fucking didn't do it.
[7544.44 → 7550.78] Um, and then just kept jacking up rates anyway, uh, for customers.
[7550.78 → 7555.78] Like it's, uh, you know, at that point you go, well, hold on a second.
[7555.78 → 7556.98] You took public funding.
[7557.10 → 7559.02] Are you a private company?
[7559.62 → 7560.82] What does that even mean?
[7560.88 → 7565.40] And I'm, to be clear, I'm, I don't think by private companies, you meant companies that
[7565.40 → 7566.68] are not publicly traded.
[7566.68 → 7569.52] I think you meant not government run entities.
[7569.52 → 7571.28] So any private or public company.
[7571.88 → 7578.56] Um, and so, so this, this problem, this, this train has been heading towards us for a long
[7578.56 → 7578.90] time.
[7578.98 → 7579.14] Yeah.
[7579.16 → 7585.60] If, if Google suddenly disappeared overnight, it would be disastrous.
[7585.98 → 7587.46] I think, I think it's fair.
[7587.50 → 7588.92] I think it's fair to use the D word.
[7590.06 → 7591.24] Yeah, it'd be disastrous.
[7591.84 → 7594.46] Um, what would the recourse be?
[7594.46 → 7595.88] I have no idea.
[7596.00 → 7603.42] I could, you know, does, can you, can you tell them, you know, send government agents
[7603.42 → 7606.88] to, you know, point a gun at them and tell them to turn the server back on?
[7606.96 → 7609.08] Like it, fuck do you do?
[7609.10 → 7609.32] Right.
[7610.48 → 7610.84] Yeah.
[7610.86 → 7611.22] I don't know.
[7612.50 → 7613.58] Silent Luke doesn't know either.
[7616.32 → 7616.68] Okay.
[7618.34 → 7618.86] I'm sorry.
[7618.90 → 7620.06] I just don't have the answer to that one.
[7620.98 → 7622.04] Certainly a complicated one.
[7622.04 → 7624.84] Um, oh no.
[7624.92 → 7626.68] Am I allowed to swear on this stream?
[7627.28 → 7627.52] No.
[7627.82 → 7628.10] Okay.
[7628.14 → 7628.86] I didn't think so.
[7629.68 → 7631.48] Um, why don't you read this one out then?
[7632.18 → 7637.78] Um, if you two are Jay and Silent Bob, who at Linus Media Group are Dante and Randall?
[7641.08 → 7642.02] What do you think, Luke?
[7642.02 → 7646.38] Who would be our Randall?
[7652.58 → 7655.60] Uh, no, I don't think so.
[7656.46 → 7656.82] Yeah.
[7657.06 → 7657.66] I don't know.
[7657.74 → 7658.12] I don't know.
[7658.20 → 7659.14] I don't think either.
[7659.32 → 7661.98] I don't think we are Jay and Bob anyway.
[7662.18 → 7664.06] So I, cool question.
[7664.22 → 7664.78] Love it.
[7665.84 → 7667.02] Useful thought experiment.
[7667.28 → 7668.90] But I, I just don't have an answer for you.
[7668.90 → 7669.20] I'm sorry.
[7669.26 → 7670.52] I'm, I'm, I'm 0 for 2.
[7670.64 → 7671.30] I'm 0 for 2.
[7672.16 → 7672.94] 0 for 2.
[7673.18 → 7674.10] Dan can swear if he wants.
[7674.18 → 7675.00] I don't, I don't give a shit.
[7675.18 → 7676.22] No, that's fine.
[7676.48 → 7677.88] Um, got one here from Patrick.
[7678.30 → 7678.60] Hi there.
[7678.68 → 7684.32] You mentioned that you had put in place a policy preventing personal items, SD cards and such,
[7684.46 → 7685.44] to be used at work.
[7685.78 → 7688.70] What problems caused this to, it's gone.
[7688.70 → 7692.54] Uh, what problems caused this, uh, to exist?
[7692.66 → 7693.76] How many items were lost?
[7694.36 → 7695.90] Oh, it wasn't that items were lost.
[7695.96 → 7697.44] It was that just, that's just stupid.
[7698.10 → 7703.18] Why are you bringing your own stupid fucking lens to work when you can just put in a procurement
[7703.18 → 7707.04] request, and we'll buy a lens, and you can keep your lens at home where it belongs and
[7707.04 → 7708.24] where it's not going to get damaged.
[7708.92 → 7711.56] Why are you putting wear and tear on your personal devices?
[7711.56 → 7713.62] I don't understand.
[7714.92 → 7718.76] There were times when we did need people to help out with their personal devices.
[7719.12 → 7721.70] Admittedly, uh, we did not have a lot of money early on.
[7722.10 → 7726.08] Um, and there have been times when procurement has been slow.
[7726.16 → 7730.42] We didn't always have a procurement department, but at this point, if you can't get something
[7730.42 → 7735.54] procured, then you need to like figure it out.
[7735.64 → 7740.18] Talk to someone in operations or procurement, get it, get it.
[7740.18 → 7741.02] Let's get her done.
[7741.56 → 7745.28] Um, because clearly if you're having a problem, then someone else is probably also having
[7745.28 → 7746.80] a problem and that's something that we need to solve.
[7747.44 → 7752.36] Uh, yeah, I just, I just didn't want to be responsible for someone's like expensive personal
[7752.36 → 7754.00] item getting lost or stolen.
[7754.44 → 7754.84] Right?
[7754.96 → 7755.68] Like that sucks.
[7758.38 → 7760.50] Hopefully my, uh, my orders will be in soon.
[7761.28 → 7763.34] Uh, this one is from Brayden.
[7763.44 → 7767.70] Hey guys, I've never been able to catch the show live, but I'm at least able to send a merch
[7767.70 → 7768.26] message today.
[7768.26 → 7772.52] I'm curious what you guys think about the leak of the Steam Deck 2.
[7772.76 → 7775.72] How did you want Valve to change slash progress with handhelds?
[7775.82 → 7776.42] Have a great week.
[7777.54 → 7778.94] I did not see it.
[7778.94 → 7779.30] I also didn't hear about this.
[7781.98 → 7782.46] Uh...
[7782.46 → 7782.90] Uh...
[7782.90 → 7788.98] I don't know.
[7790.74 → 7791.80] AMD, Little Phoenix.
[7792.48 → 7796.94] There seems to be not a lot of, um, backing for this.
[7797.02 → 7799.64] So I'm not gonna, I don't think I'm really going to weigh in on this one.
[7800.32 → 7802.70] Uh, but how do I want Valve to change slash progress?
[7802.70 → 7805.34] I mean, I mean, Steam Deck is honestly really great.
[7805.76 → 7808.42] Uh, more, more, more of that and more, better.
[7808.50 → 7809.92] I'd love to see a little bit more battery life.
[7810.00 → 7811.52] I'd love to see it be quieter, personally.
[7812.54 → 7814.28] Um, higher resolution display.
[7814.80 → 7818.84] Honestly, I'd rather have an OLED than a higher resolution LCD at this point.
[7818.84 → 7820.50] If it's a if it's a cost question.
[7820.88 → 7822.44] Or if there's a trade-off there.
[7823.34 → 7824.68] I think that's about it for me.
[7826.40 → 7828.86] Okay, and the last one I have curated is, uh, from Anonymous.
[7828.86 → 7831.88] When does Luke want to retire?
[7832.26 → 7836.22] Well, Luke would love to answer that question for you, but, uh, his jaw's a little sore, uh.
[7837.54 → 7838.20] If you know what I mean.
[7844.82 → 7847.02] Every once in a while, I have to play the character, okay?
[7847.72 → 7849.46] Um, I don't think Luke wants to retire.
[7849.72 → 7852.80] I think Luke plans to work until he drops dead.
[7853.36 → 7855.14] Um, I don't think he'd have it any other way.
[7855.14 → 7860.54] Um, there's a few more.
[7861.00 → 7863.38] Uh, Joshua C. asks, uh, Luke feel better.
[7863.68 → 7866.08] Been revamping my resume site to apply.
[7866.26 → 7868.36] Does over-engineering carry much weight in consideration?
[7868.92 → 7871.64] I would say probably not too much.
[7872.16 → 7878.92] Um, it's going to come more down to, you know, the interview and any kind of skill testing process
[7878.92 → 7880.60] that Luke has in place with his team.
[7881.44 → 7882.76] I'm going to go ahead and archive that.
[7882.76 → 7886.78] Uh, Stephen says, if you guys had a button that you press...
[7886.78 → 7890.32] Wait, what if you guys had a button you had to press at the same time on your Steam decks
[7890.32 → 7891.92] to start and stop the show?
[7892.08 → 7894.48] Kind of like those silly launch sequences.
[7894.58 → 7895.70] Oh, you mean Stream decks?
[7896.26 → 7897.20] Haha, confusing.
[7897.74 → 7899.78] Um, like those silly launch sequences.
[7900.52 → 7905.22] That would be fun and completely not worth me paying anyone to code.
[7905.22 → 7909.78] I forbid anyone from the development team who is watching this to work on a feature like that.
[7910.08 → 7911.46] That is not valuable.
[7913.88 → 7918.64] Elias asks, uh, what is your laptop and external GPU enclosure for when you travel
[7918.64 → 7921.68] and still have enough performance to play demanding titles?
[7922.56 → 7923.74] What is your laptop and external...
[7923.74 → 7924.22] For when you...
[7924.22 → 7925.34] Oh, what do you use?
[7925.70 → 7927.22] Uh, oh, I'm still using the, um...
[7927.22 → 7929.22] The, um...
[7929.22 → 7930.80] Ah, the Flow X13.
[7931.62 → 7937.72] Yeah, that thing is sick with the external, like, PCIe by 8, uh, like, uh, GPU thing.
[7937.78 → 7938.90] That's pretty sick.
[7939.56 → 7945.44] Um, I don't have to use that anymore now that Framework properly supports Thunderbolt on their
[7945.44 → 7948.56] latest laptop and I have upgraded mine to the latest platform.
[7948.92 → 7951.82] But I just, like, already have all my games on that one and stuff.
[7951.90 → 7953.20] So I just throw it in my bag.
[7953.36 → 7955.76] I don't travel much anymore, though, so it doesn't really come up too much.
[7955.76 → 7960.44] Um, AJO says, I think YouTube often gives a false impression.
[7961.02 → 7963.92] Um, Linus Media Group is, of course, a business.
[7964.04 → 7967.80] I'm not asking for names, but how many people at LMG would you consider a friend?
[7968.06 → 7969.98] Like, hanging out with after work or something?
[7970.68 → 7971.66] Ah, man.
[7972.14 → 7972.84] It's tough.
[7973.06 → 7977.30] I mean, there's too many people here that I could realistically say, I'm friends with
[7977.30 → 7977.88] everyone.
[7978.76 → 7985.06] And I'd say that there's almost certainly going to be, um, a skew towards people who have
[7985.06 → 7988.10] been here longer just because I have a lot more familiarity with them.
[7988.14 → 7989.88] And we know familiarity breeds contempt.
[7990.04 → 7992.00] I mean, um, closeness.
[7992.60 → 7993.02] Um.
[7995.98 → 7998.62] I don't hang out with almost anyone after work.
[7999.06 → 8000.22] Like, just at all.
[8001.92 → 8003.56] So, it's tough.
[8003.64 → 8005.60] Also, the lines can be a little bit blurry sometimes.
[8005.60 → 8010.78] Like, I'll, like, I'll see people that Yvonne hangs out with after work sometimes.
[8010.78 → 8013.76] So, that doesn't mean that, like, I would have invited them over.
[8014.12 → 8016.64] Like, in some cases, that would have been super weird.
[8016.96 → 8022.84] Like, if I invited, you know, yeah.
[8022.98 → 8024.20] I mean, I don't want to give, like, too much.
[8024.32 → 8026.74] I don't want to give any personal detail about anyone.
[8026.74 → 8032.14] But, like, okay, we have a female colleague that comes over on Friday night sometimes.
[8032.90 → 8034.34] I wouldn't invite them.
[8035.06 → 8035.44] That's.
[8036.98 → 8038.76] I just wouldn't, you know?
[8039.38 → 8041.70] To my house on a Friday night.
[8042.46 → 8043.42] I just wouldn't.
[8043.78 → 8045.64] It's not worth it.
[8045.70 → 8046.84] Even if nothing happened.
[8048.78 → 8051.52] I don't want them to have been there.
[8051.70 → 8054.34] And me being there, it's just, it's not worth it, you know?
[8054.64 → 8055.52] People talk, right?
[8055.52 → 8055.60] Right.
[8056.82 → 8057.50] Yvonne can.
[8058.08 → 8058.90] And I'll be like, hi.
[8060.56 → 8061.22] See you later.
[8061.70 → 8062.54] Enjoy craft night.
[8063.24 → 8063.38] No?
[8070.64 → 8073.94] These, the reasons I have to read them is because they haven't actually been, like, sorted yet.
[8074.00 → 8075.18] So, I'm just kind of Soloing it.
[8075.64 → 8079.04] Renee asks, what's the most important tech upgrade in your house over a normal house?
[8079.16 → 8079.56] Ethernet.
[8080.60 → 8081.82] Ethernet and Conduit everywhere.
[8082.44 → 8083.52] Man, I love Conduit.
[8083.52 → 8087.84] Just, like, run cables to places where that didn't have before cables.
[8088.04 → 8088.80] Ah, love it.
[8089.12 → 8094.56] And just having Ethernet everywhere is kind of like, it's kind of like having emergency Conduit.
[8094.66 → 8096.90] Because you can convert Ethernet to damn near anything.
[8096.90 → 8098.90] HDMI, freaking whatever.
[8099.12 → 8099.66] I don't know, man.
[8099.78 → 8101.12] It's, it's, Ethernet's awesome.
[8101.18 → 8101.56] I love it.
[8101.72 → 8103.98] I'll use my second time of saying something.
[8104.32 → 8109.48] Conduit is one of the extremely few points in life where you can actually future-proof something.
[8109.58 → 8109.92] Yes.
[8110.70 → 8111.48] Conduit's cool.
[8111.48 → 8115.52] Rail H asks what would you say your videos are rated?
[8115.84 → 8120.20] I love watching with my son, but sometimes your sexual jokes are definitely not for kids.
[8120.58 → 8123.10] Can you please put a rating prior to starting the video?
[8123.22 → 8127.10] I can tell you right now there's probably not going to be a rating at the beginning of every video.
[8127.18 → 8128.20] That would be pretty jarring.
[8128.20 → 8133.02] I think it would open us up to widespread mockery.
[8133.74 → 8138.90] But if I had to give a rating, I'd say we're probably PG-13 for the most part.
[8139.02 → 8140.40] Today's WAN show is a bit of an exception.
[8140.64 → 8143.18] There was a fairly egregious amount of swearing.
[8143.86 → 8147.92] I'm pretty sure this is going to end up with limited monetization.
[8147.92 → 8151.76] I think I've kind of, I think I've targeted, and I'm probably going to land there.
[8153.28 → 8155.94] But yeah, PG-13 is sort of what we go for.
[8156.04 → 8157.78] Parental guidance is advised.
[8159.04 → 8160.14] Glad you like it, Chris L.
[8160.26 → 8162.10] All right, that's it for the show.
[8162.32 → 8163.72] We will see you again next week.
[8163.98 → 8167.28] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[8168.24 → 8168.64] Bye.
[8169.52 → 8170.50] He tried, guys.
[8170.58 → 8170.86] He tried.
[8170.98 → 8171.84] That's as much as I can do.
[8177.34 → 8178.28] Dan's working on it.
[8179.76 → 8180.92] Oh, it broke the thing.
[8181.14 → 8181.78] Thanks, Chris L.
[8181.78 → 8190.72] I am sweating so very much.
[8191.66 → 8193.28] Hey, I'm wearing plastic.
[8194.36 → 8195.78] There is zero breathability.
[8195.94 → 8196.92] I know you're suffering.
[8198.38 → 8203.12] But I am a sweaty boy from the tip of my head to the balls of my toes.
[8203.12 → 8203.26] Bruce Lone.
[8203.46 → 8203.96] I am really excited for you.
[8203.96 → 8204.82] Cheers.
[8204.82 → 8204.92] Peace.
[8205.00 → 8205.44] Peace.
[8207.02 → 8207.44] Peace.
[8208.00 → 8209.02] Peace.
[8210.96 → 8211.02] Peace.
[8211.02 → 8211.08] Peace.
[8211.08 → 8211.92] Peace.
[8212.96 → 8213.20] Peace.
[8213.42 → 8213.82] Peace.
[8213.82 → 8213.84] Peace.
[8213.86 → 8215.42] Peace.
[8215.96 → 8216.30] Peace.
[8216.30 → 8216.88] Peace.
[8216.88 → 8217.10] Peace.
[8217.18 → 8217.30] Peace.
[8217.30 → 8217.58] Peace.
[8217.58 → 8217.80] Peace.
[8218.10 → 8219.02] Peace.
[8219.02 → 8219.84] Peace.
[8221.20 → 8221.26] Peace.
[8221.26 → 8222.20] Peace.
[8222.38 → 8224.82] Peace.
[8224.94 → 8225.26] Peace.
[8225.26 → 8225.36] Peace.
[8225.36 → 8225.40] Peace.
[8225.62 → 8225.72] Peace.
[8225.92 → 8227.06] Peace.
[8227.06 → 8227.50] Peace.
[8228.10 → 8228.62] Peace.
[8228.76 → 8229.14] Peace.
[8229.30 → 8230.06] Peace.
[8230.06 → 8231.10] Peace.
[8231.10 → 8231.24] Peace.
[8231.24 → 8232.40] Pharisee.
