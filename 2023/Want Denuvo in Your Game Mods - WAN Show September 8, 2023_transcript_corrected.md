[0.00 → 5.80] What's up everyone and welcome to the WAN show. We have a fantastic show lined up for you guys today.
[6.48 → 9.60] What is up with game mods getting DRM?
[10.50 → 16.96] Okay, we're going to be talking about that. The Starfield DLSS 3 mod has reignited controversy over paid mods.
[17.48 → 23.00] Also, Mozilla has found that cars are a privacy nightmare watching you sleep and...
[24.10 → 26.62] not sleep, as it were. What else we got?
[26.62 → 31.42] The Nintendo Switch 2 or whatever it might be named has been demoed behind closed doors.
[31.70 → 38.56] And we'll talk about what we would want from it. Yeah, I mean nobody knows anything, but I know what I want to see.
[39.10 → 41.34] Yeah, yeah, and Rockstar...
[43.06 → 46.50] They just use pirated copies of their own games to sell.
[47.14 → 49.14] Yeah. What a hack.
[49.42 → 51.74] Right? What a cheat codes. Can you steal
[51.74 → 54.74] is it a real pirated code? I think so.
[54.74 → 57.98] I think so. I think so. I think there are guidelines about that.
[57.98 → 58.48] Yeah.
[59.62 → 60.62] That's a dated reference.
[62.18 → 63.18] I liked it.
[63.18 → 85.30] The show is brought to you today by The Ridge Secret Lab and...
[85.30 → 88.90] Wow, those go really fast. Red Magic. Thank you, Dan.
[88.90 → 92.04] Why don't we jump right into our headline topic today?
[92.90 → 93.40] Paid mods.
[93.80 → 98.52] Starfield's DLSS 3 mod has reignited controversy over paid mods.
[99.12 → 107.88] Fodder Pure Dark released a DLSS 2 slash XCSS mod for Starfield for free on Nexus Mods.
[108.22 → 108.90] But...
[109.44 → 114.14] Which is really great, by the way, because the fact that the game did not support DLSS out of the box,
[114.14 → 119.48] as Luke and I observed when we did our early access playtime with it,
[119.54 → 125.04] that unfortunately is not going to be a YouTube video, but will be available on Float plane.
[125.14 → 126.60] It just...
[126.60 → 128.24] Yeah, I can talk a little bit more about that later.
[128.30 → 129.84] But it's not coming to YouTube ultimately.
[129.98 → 134.30] But we definitely noticed that it would have been nice to have DLSS S.
[134.56 → 135.64] But here's the thing.
[135.64 → 144.02] In addition to the free mod on Nexus Mods, they also posted an early build of the same mod that included DLSS 3,
[144.46 → 150.28] including NVIDIA's frame generation feature that is only supported on RTX 4000 series cards.
[150.36 → 156.30] And they released this on their Patreon page, requiring a $5 monthly sub to access it.
[156.70 → 162.00] Users reported that a single payment, though, so subscribing for just one month,
[162.00 → 164.64] appears to unlock the mod perpetually.
[165.14 → 168.64] Which, honestly, I'm okay with.
[169.00 → 175.14] Like, if you have a subscription, but people are allowed to have all-you-can-eat while they have the subscription...
[175.14 → 178.44] I mean, it's basically the same way that we did all the behind-the-scenes content from LTX.
[178.68 → 178.84] Yeah.
[179.10 → 182.06] You upgrade your subscription to enjoy the LTX content.
[182.06 → 185.06] If you still like having 4K on Float plane, then great, you can keep it.
[185.14 → 187.62] And otherwise, well, you watched it, and can download it even.
[187.86 → 190.02] Like, Float plane doesn't have DRM, actually.
[190.52 → 191.44] But this mod does.
[192.00 → 198.68] Users reported that the mod requires a login to authenticate that you have paid for it before it will work.
[199.50 → 206.64] Pure Dark also added the same digital rights management to their DLSS 3 mod for Red Dead Redemption 2.
[207.76 → 208.72] This is in bold.
[208.86 → 209.52] I wonder if...
[209.52 → 209.80] Hold on.
[209.88 → 212.00] I wonder if that means that it's an always-online thing.
[213.32 → 214.68] No, I don't think so.
[214.68 → 216.40] Because I think it's just an unlocked thing.
[216.58 → 218.88] It authenticates once, you get a checkmark, and then you're good to go.
[218.88 → 220.06] Yeah, like WinRAR style.
[220.06 → 226.66] So, DRM, though, and this is in bold in our notes, is virtually unheard of for mods.
[226.66 → 229.98] But it seems to have worked in Pure Dark's favour.
[230.08 → 235.02] By some accounts, they appear to have made over $40,000 this month.
[235.22 → 238.58] Which is, last time I checked, a flipping lot of money.
[238.64 → 238.84] Yeah.
[239.28 → 245.66] Which goes to show you how many gamers value having access to these features and how baffling it is that Bethesda...
[245.66 → 255.06] There's been some kind of tinfoil hat conspiracy theory stuff that AMD might have put pressure on Bethesda to not have it.
[255.10 → 259.92] But then AMD said they were super chill with it having DLSS, but then...
[259.92 → 262.48] But then Bethesda's basically, like, refused to comment on it, really.
[262.76 → 263.62] It didn't have it.
[263.68 → 268.40] And now a single fodder in, like, seven, eight days.
[268.40 → 270.40] I'm pretty sure this was out before the game was out.
[271.56 → 273.80] Well, no, I'm doing the math from early access.
[273.96 → 274.76] Oh, okay, I understand.
[274.82 → 275.00] Yeah, yeah.
[275.62 → 279.28] Eight or nine days or whatever it works out to has managed to hack it into the game.
[281.68 → 283.30] Obviously, QC takes time.
[283.52 → 287.46] In some cases, QC can take more time than the actual development.
[287.72 → 291.86] But it's pretty clear to me that this is something that if they'd had the will, they could have done it.
[291.86 → 298.86] I do wonder if it's not contractual, but if it's just kind of like, you know...
[298.86 → 301.18] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[301.20 → 301.96] Yeah, you know, yeah.
[302.06 → 302.84] A little under the table.
[303.12 → 303.94] Yeah, yeah, right?
[304.42 → 310.86] So I just checked the original mod, the free mod on Nexus Mods was uploaded on September 1st.
[311.24 → 311.52] Wow.
[314.80 → 321.30] Now, unsurprisingly, you have to love dodders and game crackers and hackers and whatnot.
[321.30 → 321.82] You don't...
[321.82 → 325.62] The mod's DRM was cracked and pirated in a matter of days.
[325.80 → 329.82] And a free alternative was uploaded to Nexus Mods by Luke.
[329.92 → 330.42] Relation of yours?
[330.52 → 331.48] Not my alias.
[331.72 → 335.22] Which ignited a debate over Pure Dark's approach.
[336.02 → 336.92] But why?
[337.46 → 338.18] This is cool.
[338.32 → 347.80] So we had the news team reach out to a developer who explained that there are essentially two main ways in which the mod community views itself.
[348.18 → 351.08] Coined by legendary Borrowing fodder, Rai.
[351.30 → 358.60] The cathedral view and the parlour view are sort of diametrically opposed.
[359.26 → 359.38] Yeah.
[359.50 → 361.52] Sort of incompatible with each other in a sense.
[361.64 → 367.54] The cathedral view sees dodders participating in a joint effort to build something amazing.
[367.54 → 375.50] So to those folks, the idea of locking a single stained-glass window behind a paywall seems ridiculous and counterproductive.
[375.62 → 375.94] I would...
[375.94 → 381.04] I haven't asked them if they see themselves this way, but I would look at, like, the Sky Oblivion project in that light.
[381.44 → 383.28] It's a huge team of dodders...
[383.28 → 384.32] Enormous undertaking.
[384.68 → 388.44] ...collaboratively working on something for years to make this incredible project.
[388.44 → 389.10] Look into it.
[389.16 → 390.38] It's actually stunning.
[390.44 → 393.74] Basically, they take the whole Oblivion game and just...
[394.74 → 397.26] ...into the Skyrim engine.
[397.32 → 400.48] But then with, like, amazing assets to it and everything.
[400.56 → 401.74] Like, it's...
[401.74 → 403.86] I'm going to be so stoked when that comes out.
[403.98 → 406.74] Like, it is not just Oblivion, but prettier.
[406.86 → 408.34] It is basically rebuilt.
[408.34 → 408.76] Yeah.
[408.86 → 409.48] So cool.
[409.56 → 412.24] And it looks a lot better than, like, Skyrim did at launch.
[412.30 → 417.74] It looks, like, heavily modded, like, beautiful, perfection Skyrim, but it's Oblivion.
[417.92 → 419.22] Like, it's incredible.
[419.42 → 420.14] It's fantastic.
[420.42 → 429.08] On the other side of things, the parlour view sees individual mods as art pieces that are displayed in the fodder's parlour.
[429.34 → 433.96] And the fodder can choose to close the parlour doors anytime they choose.
[433.96 → 447.10] In addition to dodders of the Cathedral School here, much of the backlash to the mods Paywall plus DRM seems to be coming from young gamers with little or no disposable income.
[447.92 → 453.18] Riley's note here is who seemingly possess RTX 40 series cards and a $70 game.
[453.26 → 457.28] See, I actually am very strongly in Riley's camp here.
[457.28 → 467.68] I think that a lot of the outrage over $5 items is probably manufactured as opposed to...
[467.68 → 468.28] Or...
[468.84 → 474.24] I think people have at least a feeling of being principled on it.
[474.30 → 477.52] Like, I don't think it's about the money, is, I guess, what I'm trying to say.
[477.72 → 477.82] Yeah.
[478.98 → 480.84] The debate over paid mods is nothing new.
[480.84 → 485.48] In 2015, Steam added, then removed paid mod functionality from the Steam Workshop.
[485.96 → 497.26] In 2017, Bethesda launched the Creation Club, a service hosting user-generated content that Bethesda explicitly described as not paid mods since existing mods were not allowed.
[497.40 → 500.52] Only new content that was developed with Bethesda's approval was allowed.
[501.10 → 505.26] But many other user-generated content marketplaces do exist, like Minecraft Marketplace.
[505.36 → 508.42] Or, I mean, the entire game of Roblox.
[508.42 → 512.66] That's the point of Roblox.
[513.06 → 519.94] So, I guess at risk of us angering 50% of the internet, no matter which stance we take here...
[519.94 → 520.20] Yeah.
[520.58 → 522.22] What's your take on this?
[522.60 → 522.96] I don't know.
[523.02 → 523.92] I think it's complicated.
[524.74 → 526.36] Well, yeah, it's definitely complicated.
[526.50 → 527.14] Thank you for that.
[527.22 → 528.34] I very much...
[528.34 → 529.90] Professor Obvious.
[530.20 → 535.58] I like the approach that a group like Oblivion takes.
[535.58 → 537.10] Sure, but can you demand that?
[537.44 → 538.40] I don't think so.
[538.62 → 543.06] I think if someone wants to do a bunch of work, and they want to get paid for their work,
[543.12 → 547.60] it is their right to put their work up for sale, effectively.
[548.18 → 549.62] But I just...
[549.62 → 550.54] Yeah, I don't know.
[550.82 → 552.04] Why do I even read Twitch chat?
[552.28 → 554.52] Linus, you're disregarding the precedent this might set.
[554.96 → 556.34] I haven't taken a stance!
[556.34 → 557.48] Well, it could...
[557.48 → 559.36] That's, I think, one of my biggest concerns.
[559.36 → 559.58] Sure.
[559.58 → 564.12] It could really change the community very heavily.
[564.24 → 565.04] Now, tell me this.
[566.20 → 571.54] Let's take a big picture, sort of 10-year outlook approach here.
[571.54 → 578.70] Do you think that in the grand scheme of things, it will ultimately be a net benefit to the modding community?
[578.86 → 579.64] In terms of...
[579.64 → 585.54] And I don't mean a net benefit in terms of money, because obviously if they make money, that is a net benefit.
[585.64 → 590.68] I mean in terms of the quality and the diversity of the mods that gamers get to enjoy.
[590.68 → 593.12] Do you think it will be a net benefit to modding?
[593.12 → 594.48] I honestly think it would be a negative.
[595.10 → 596.84] Okay, but I haven't even finished asking the question.
[597.00 → 601.24] I know that you and I mind meld, but I do need to ask for their benefit.
[601.34 → 601.72] All right.
[602.34 → 608.68] Okay, is it a net benefit to have this source of income going into the modding community in general
[608.68 → 616.82] that either doesn't exist or exists only in certain marketplaces, like Roblox, for example, where it's very prevalent?
[616.82 → 623.58] Or is it a net negative outcome that, and now that he's taken some of the wind out of my sails,
[623.62 → 632.54] I'm going to take some of the wind out of his, that could actually hurt the passionate roots of modding in general,
[632.64 → 640.96] in the first place, and take some of the just-because-I-can spirit out of it and potentially hurt modding?
[641.60 → 643.64] Yeah, so that's everything I was going to say.
[644.24 → 644.52] Got it.
[645.20 → 646.52] I don't know.
[646.52 → 653.04] It's like, if someone wants to work on something, they completely deserve the right to be able to sell it.
[653.10 → 658.30] But I do think that some other things come into question at that point, because if you are doing this for profit,
[659.00 → 662.14] here's going to be a hyper-controversial take that people are not going to like.
[663.04 → 666.24] Why shouldn't Bethesda get some of that money?
[667.52 → 667.88] Ooh.
[668.36 → 669.50] See, you know what?
[669.96 → 670.92] Okay, look at my screen.
[671.34 → 672.74] Look at what I put in Notepad.
[672.74 → 679.82] I specifically, I wrote down, deserve to sell it, because he did say that.
[680.26 → 688.12] They are relying on somebody else's IP, someone else's blood, sweat, and tears, I don't know.
[688.48 → 690.26] Someone else's blood, sweat, and tears.
[690.26 → 690.88] There are only beers in there somewhere.
[690.88 → 694.12] To provide a platform for them to sell their service.
[694.52 → 702.16] Not only that, but what isn't out right now but will be coming is the creation kit, which is a series of modding tools.
[702.16 → 709.58] If you look at something like game engines, if you make a game using a game engine that is free, they will then take money from the sales of your game.
[709.68 → 709.92] Yes.
[710.02 → 711.30] This is a very normal thing.
[711.38 → 717.30] So if people are going to stand and say that they want to sell mods, which again, if they want to, I think they should be able to.
[717.30 → 729.52] If they're going to use tools like the creation kit or potentially even if they're just going to mod the game at all, does it make sense at that point for the company that released the game to make some of the money from it?
[729.56 → 730.14] I think maybe.
[730.14 → 747.42] And I think one of the beautiful parts of the modding community and something that I've really enjoyed about it and before people jump on me, I am a Nexus Mods subscriber and I have donated to multiple modding projects because I have thought it's decently important in the past because I am gaining a massive amount of enjoyment from these mods.
[747.58 → 749.88] There are games that I will play with mods on them.
[750.56 → 752.24] I would not play without it.
[752.64 → 754.54] So like at that point in time.
[754.78 → 754.82] Okay.
[754.82 → 764.82] Now that's where we get into a fascinating counterpoint here because you just said dodders should be giving Bethesda a cut of their revenues.
[765.00 → 769.24] But then you also just said there are games that I wouldn't play.
[769.24 → 778.80] And I think for a lot of gamers, Never mind wouldn't play, wouldn't buy in the first place if it wasn't for the rich, vibrant modding communities that are around them.
[779.68 → 781.42] So who should be paying who?
[781.42 → 793.34] Or is this just a purely symbiotic relationship where both parties should tolerate or even respect each other and try to cooperate?
[793.86 → 800.10] But then if someone in bad faith creates a mod that damages the brand of the company that created the original game.
[800.22 → 800.66] Which has happened.
[800.68 → 801.32] Which has happened.
[801.54 → 803.66] I mean, rule 34.
[803.66 → 812.66] Well, no, with Bethesda actually, with I think it was Oblivion, dodders found that you could take the underwear.
[812.66 → 813.50] Is this going to be up?
[814.30 → 815.66] You could take the underwear model.
[816.62 → 819.34] You could take the underwear texture off of the character models.
[819.56 → 823.42] And when you did that, there were graphical things under them.
[824.30 → 825.96] And they were like, whoa, what the heck?
[826.02 → 826.94] This is already in the game.
[827.00 → 829.08] And then that reached out to, I believe, ESB.
[829.14 → 830.64] And they wanted to change the rating on the game.
[830.64 → 831.72] And all these things happened.
[832.24 → 834.26] So this has happened to literally Bethesda.
[835.80 → 839.56] And, okay, so I'm seeing some people in chat being like, no.
[840.10 → 841.48] Jaden actually brings up a perfect point.
[841.54 → 844.18] I think you don't have to pay a car manufacturer if you mod your car.
[844.92 → 851.94] I think my point here would be the tools that are being released by these companies in order to allow people to mod it.
[851.94 → 863.62] But I think most games, a lot of games have modding happen to them that don't try to make that happen, if you know what I mean.
[863.82 → 873.90] Whereas I think if a car manufacturer were to provide a tuning shop with resources that enable them to tune the cars better,
[873.90 → 876.32] I think that that's something that they could reasonably charge for.
[876.32 → 880.48] I think it would be, yeah, I guess what I would say is I don't think there should be like a requirement.
[880.48 → 885.32] But I think at that point that should also be seen as a reasonable approach.
[885.60 → 896.74] And another game could take an approach of going, look, we're going to provide these modding tools and not charge for them to try to be the more hyper mod friendly game.
[896.74 → 905.02] But I think the anger that would traditionally go towards a game developer for trying to skim some mod money,
[905.52 → 910.14] if we're also cool with dodders charging for it, I think both of those things should probably be okay.
[910.78 → 911.10] Right.
[911.22 → 917.48] But if the mods are free traditionally, and then the game company is like, hey, we're going to skim some money, and you have to pay for these now.
[917.74 → 918.50] That's a little weird.
[918.88 → 920.26] And then they're imposing their will.
[920.42 → 920.60] Yeah.
[920.86 → 921.00] Yeah.
[921.44 → 922.70] That's where I think I'm at.
[922.80 → 923.40] I'm not really sure.
[923.40 → 928.62] Now, back to that point that was, you know, basically think about the precedent this sets.
[928.78 → 930.42] Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[930.76 → 934.14] If you run a modded game, maybe this deserves a pull.
[934.42 → 935.54] I think this deserves a pull.
[935.82 → 936.88] Do you want to set up the pull?
[936.98 → 937.08] Yeah.
[937.34 → 937.56] Okay.
[937.62 → 946.84] If you run a modded game, I would posit, I would guess that you probably don't run one mod.
[946.84 → 955.14] So let's, let's, let's, let's, I'm only really speaking to the people who like to mod games here.
[955.20 → 959.32] So if you don't want any games and the answer is zero, you don't need to participate in the pull.
[959.80 → 969.84] Let's say one to two, three to five, six to 10 or 10 or 11 plus or something like that.
[969.84 → 976.18] You know, how many mods would you expect to be running on a game that you like to play?
[976.56 → 985.34] Because there's everything, everything from texture packs to, you know, face replacements to, you know, sound effect replacements.
[985.44 → 989.76] Like basically the sky is the limit when it comes to modding.
[990.10 → 993.04] New gameplay modes, different difficulties.
[993.28 → 994.12] You can add new spells.
[994.12 → 995.38] There are all kinds of things.
[995.38 → 995.76] What is the question?
[995.94 → 997.98] How many mods would you typically apply to a game?
[997.98 → 1002.16] Ooh, this is going to range an incredible amount depending on what game they play.
[1002.40 → 1006.62] So is this, is this how many mods you actually do typically run?
[1006.74 → 1006.88] Yeah.
[1006.88 → 1007.32] Like, okay.
[1007.44 → 1007.66] Yeah.
[1007.84 → 1008.08] Yeah.
[1008.42 → 1011.06] One to two, three to five, six to 10, 11 plus.
[1011.76 → 1013.60] Uh, one to two, 11 plus.
[1013.76 → 1013.86] Okay.
[1014.28 → 1021.00] Well, yeah, because honestly, I mean, for Beat Safer, I will easily be running over 10 mods at a given time.
[1021.94 → 1024.24] And I don't always because there's...
[1024.24 → 1027.90] Oh no, I think, I think you're not understanding my, my laughter is there's people that are going to be at like,
[1027.98 → 1028.38] 900.
[1028.70 → 1029.30] Yeah, I believe you.
[1029.34 → 1029.54] Okay.
[1029.66 → 1029.78] Yeah.
[1030.06 → 1030.30] Yeah.
[1030.80 → 1034.62] But I just, I just want to get a rough idea because I'm, I'm coming to something with this.
[1034.94 → 1037.60] I'll, I'll be, I'll be making a point with this at some point.
[1037.96 → 1038.92] Uh, is that, is a pull-up?
[1039.16 → 1039.40] Okay.
[1039.40 → 1040.00] Let's have a look.
[1040.06 → 1041.20] Let's have a look at the results here.
[1041.98 → 1047.18] So this is exactly what I was expecting.
[1047.74 → 1055.54] We've got handfuls of people around 10 to 15% each that are saying, you know, one to two, three to five, six to 10.
[1055.56 → 1055.84] Hold on.
[1055.92 → 1056.40] Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[1056.52 → 1056.66] Yeah.
[1056.66 → 1065.24] There are a bunch of comments right now that I think are, um, right now we're talking about games that you mod.
[1065.80 → 1067.20] We're not talking about games that you don't mod.
[1067.20 → 1067.80] Not all games that you play.
[1067.98 → 1068.24] Yes.
[1068.46 → 1068.68] Yes.
[1068.68 → 1069.20] It's okay.
[1069.26 → 1069.46] Okay.
[1069.46 → 1069.94] Okay.
[1070.18 → 1074.00] But over half are saying 11 plus.
[1074.32 → 1074.40] Yeah.
[1074.50 → 1076.36] And here's the point that I'm coming to.
[1076.44 → 1086.08] And here's where I think the slippery slope argument starts to gain some momentum for me.
[1087.74 → 1088.76] This is what?
[1088.88 → 1090.04] A $70 game?
[1090.34 → 1091.20] $80 game?
[1091.56 → 1091.88] Right?
[1091.94 → 1093.40] Like depending on your currency, right?
[1093.42 → 1096.16] It's going to be somewhere between 50 to $120.
[1096.78 → 1097.00] Yeah.
[1097.00 → 1098.74] I think it's 79 up in Canada or something.
[1098.74 → 1098.86] Yeah.
[1098.86 → 1099.56] Something like that.
[1100.28 → 1110.44] By the time you pay $5, which was the price of this particular mod for 10 mods, you are danged close to doubling the cost of the game.
[1112.90 → 1114.32] What if you're running 900?
[1115.20 → 1116.94] What if you're running 900 mods?
[1117.08 → 1119.12] Now you're playing a train simulator.
[1119.12 → 1127.80] Now, unless you're basically like a mobile gaming microtransaction whale, you don't get to play the game that you want to play.
[1127.80 → 1142.86] Also, if the DRM scheme is such that you have to pay for the mod before you can even try it, I think what's going to happen is you're going to see a lot less momentum for these modding communities, for these dodders.
[1142.86 → 1148.62] Because people aren't just going to throw it on and see what happens and see if it's any good.
[1148.80 → 1152.66] Because the only way for them to monetize that model would be always online.
[1153.14 → 1160.66] They would have to check if you're running it so that you could have a one-hour free demo of a texture upgrade mod or something like that.
[1161.52 → 1161.64] Yeah.
[1161.64 → 1166.04] Now, I'm not opposed to that money getting spread around.
[1166.66 → 1166.74] Right?
[1167.04 → 1167.42] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1167.44 → 1183.18] Compared to the predatory whale model that mobile gaming uses, where all the money is going to the developers, I don't mind the passionate, enthusiastic individuals or small groups in the community making some money.
[1183.24 → 1184.40] That's not a problem to me.
[1184.40 → 1198.06] But I am not a huge fan of a single player game going from, you know, $60, $80 to, I don't know, $400 by the time you have all the quality of life.
[1198.06 → 1209.96] By the time you have enough freaking slots in your belt that you can actually, like, gobble down enough potions and food to survive some stupid boss fight or something.
[1210.06 → 1210.12] Right?
[1210.20 → 1216.12] Like, that's the kind of crap that, yeah, probably should be solvable without having to pay a ton of money.
[1216.90 → 1221.62] At least in my, like, you know, monkey caveman early gamer brain.
[1222.04 → 1224.56] But then somebody did that work, so why aren't they compensated?
[1224.56 → 1225.56] Like, I can't...
[1225.56 → 1231.46] Is this one of those rare times that I'm just like, no, I actually cannot take a stance on this.
[1231.50 → 1236.12] I just want to talk through all the different perspectives and then fold my hands like this and go, well...
[1236.12 → 1236.46] Maybe.
[1236.74 → 1246.06] Yeah, I, like, this is effectively what you're talking about right now is why my first initial thing was like, yeah, it's going to completely change the whole landscape if it goes this way.
[1246.68 → 1252.06] Because you look at some of the games that are most well-known, um...
[1254.62 → 1255.28] Oh, yeah.
[1255.56 → 1261.18] Uh, Avon Fox in Full Plain Chat said, people copying other people's mods a thousand times over and renaming them to sell will also be rife.
[1261.74 → 1266.12] Yeah, it's interesting because, like, if you're selling something, um...
[1266.12 → 1272.12] You probably should also be able to handle customer support and refunds and...
[1272.60 → 1275.62] Uh, what if there's compatibility issues with other people's mods?
[1275.62 → 1279.88] Um, how do you deal with who has to deal with that problem?
[1279.88 → 1280.28] Yeah.
[1280.96 → 1284.70] Um, and the like, drama and issues that that's going to cause.
[1285.18 → 1285.96] Um...
[1285.96 → 1287.82] There are lots of issues.
[1288.02 → 1288.18] I just...
[1288.84 → 1290.18] Basically, my...
[1290.76 → 1291.18] I...
[1291.18 → 1291.52] I...
[1291.52 → 1292.38] I don't know.
[1292.64 → 1298.88] Yeah, there's a big difference between the level of polish that something needs to kind of Huck it out there for free...
[1298.88 → 1299.74] Versus be a product.
[1299.98 → 1300.76] Versus be a product.
[1300.92 → 1301.70] Like, I think a perfect...
[1301.70 → 1310.88] And that is, to be clear, there are plenty of free mods that are absolutely astonishingly good and deserve to effectively equate to product.
[1310.88 → 1313.76] This is a perfect example of that kind of thing.
[1314.56 → 1317.36] Merch messages is a super cool product.
[1317.36 → 1320.66] And really, really useful for us.
[1320.70 → 1321.62] What are we saying here?
[1322.16 → 1322.98] No, we're saying...
[1322.98 → 1324.86] What we're saying is, you and I have talked about this.
[1324.98 → 1329.06] We're saying that if we were to roll this out for other creators...
[1329.06 → 1330.04] Oh, yeah.
[1330.08 → 1337.70] The amount of documentation, the amount of, like, polish, the amount of, um...
[1337.70 → 1340.06] Mostly documentation, really, like, just...
[1340.06 → 1341.74] Retooling in a bunch of different ways.
[1341.74 → 1345.48] Yeah, the amount of work that it would take to get it just...
[1345.48 → 1348.80] And we would basically need people on call, like, all the time.
[1348.82 → 1349.82] Yeah, the support.
[1349.98 → 1350.88] Because what if there's an issue?
[1351.20 → 1354.52] And so, you know, you look at a product like this, and you go, wow, holy smokes.
[1354.86 → 1361.64] Any creator with a Shopify store could be benefiting from merch messages the same way that we are.
[1362.14 → 1368.92] Their communities could be benefiting from, instead of throwing money at the screen, ordering products that support the creator.
[1368.92 → 1375.72] The creator is probably getting a very similar cut, assuming their platform takes, you know, 50 to 30 percent or whatever it is.
[1376.34 → 1378.70] And you actually get a product in the mail.
[1378.76 → 1381.52] Like, it's just better.
[1382.78 → 1383.26] And so it's...
[1383.26 → 1384.92] This isn't to say we will never do that.
[1385.02 → 1385.42] No, no.
[1385.42 → 1386.90] There's just reasons why we haven't done it yet.
[1387.24 → 1391.24] But there's been a lot of work that's gone into it to get it to the point that it is.
[1391.24 → 1396.54] And to get it that, like, 8 percent more, I don't know.
[1396.72 → 1396.96] Double?
[1397.58 → 1398.54] Triple the amount of work?
[1398.64 → 1400.60] Like, I don't even know how to quantify that.
[1401.86 → 1403.48] Conrad, M-M-A-A-S.
[1403.64 → 1404.98] Merch messages as a service.
[1407.42 → 1408.58] I honestly...
[1408.58 → 1410.16] Conrad works on merch messages.
[1410.38 → 1411.68] Conrad would know better than me.
[1411.74 → 1414.42] But it's a very, very significant amount more work.
[1414.50 → 1415.66] Especially to make it scalable.
[1415.66 → 1417.66] Like, there's...
[1417.66 → 1418.20] Yeah.
[1418.48 → 1421.42] Because we're not just making another version for someone.
[1421.76 → 1424.78] We're making a version that can be used by X amount of people.
[1424.96 → 1426.26] Not one more person.
[1426.46 → 1428.92] So that in itself is, like, a huge issue.
[1429.10 → 1431.22] Here's a question you might know the answer to.
[1433.08 → 1436.44] How much more work was Flow plane to make it so that other...
[1436.44 → 1436.84] Oh, God.
[1437.00 → 1437.34] Yeah.
[1438.28 → 1438.76] Astronomical.
[1439.50 → 1445.16] It was, like, honestly, not really that bad to make it just for us.
[1445.66 → 1448.22] Like, near the end of the forum version.
[1448.86 → 1449.70] It was pretty good.
[1451.36 → 1452.40] Like, it was fine.
[1452.58 → 1452.80] Yeah.
[1453.52 → 1453.96] Yeah.
[1454.72 → 1455.90] And then we try to scale.
[1456.08 → 1458.78] Yeah, Forged Alliance Forever is talking about this.
[1458.78 → 1461.72] The default Supreme Commander community is virtually dead.
[1461.84 → 1464.96] The vast majority of Supreme Commander sales, however small that may be,
[1465.28 → 1467.24] are for using a modded client.
[1467.38 → 1473.72] And my understanding is that they are not allowed to directly monetize.
[1473.82 → 1475.02] Like, they're not allowed to profit from it.
[1475.02 → 1476.10] I think it's a not-for-profit.
[1476.68 → 1477.90] Don't quote me on that.
[1478.08 → 1478.44] Not sure.
[1478.50 → 1480.92] I don't have a ton of detail about that.
[1481.02 → 1487.32] But they definitely do run it as a very donation-only kind of deal.
[1487.62 → 1491.14] So maybe someone who knows a bit more can post in the Flow plane chat or whatever else.
[1491.14 → 1493.16] I don't know.
[1493.16 → 1495.74] I think this is extremely complicated.
[1496.10 → 1504.42] And at the end of the day, it's going to come down to the community, not the collective to decide.
[1504.68 → 1507.78] It's going to come down to the individual members of the community.
[1507.78 → 1508.76] Because that's the thing.
[1508.76 → 1514.66] We talk about the community as this singular entity a lot.
[1514.88 → 1516.74] But that's simply not the case.
[1517.30 → 1526.20] And so, even if, let's say, hypothetical members, let's say 99% of the community opposed modding,
[1526.20 → 1532.38] or opposed paid mods, and especially DRM mods, how many copies of Starfield have they sold so far?
[1532.44 → 1533.06] Do we know that?
[1533.38 → 1534.18] Have they announced anything?
[1534.18 → 1539.06] I know they had over a million players at one time or whatever.
[1539.40 → 1539.56] Yeah.
[1539.56 → 1544.80] Over a million players were playing the premium edition on both Steam and Xbox,
[1545.04 → 1548.42] putting premium edition sales well above two million copies.
[1548.56 → 1549.34] Okay, so what's the cost?
[1549.52 → 1550.12] Okay, you know what?
[1550.18 → 1550.98] That doesn't matter.
[1551.08 → 1554.26] The point is, the amount, the revenue doesn't matter in this,
[1554.46 → 1558.02] for what I'm trying to explain right now, or what I'm trying to demonstrate right now.
[1558.14 → 1562.86] The point I'm trying to make is that at two million copies of this game,
[1562.90 → 1564.42] and it's a lot more than that,
[1565.36 → 1569.04] 10% of that would be 200,000, right?
[1569.56 → 1573.06] And 1% of that would be 20,000.
[1573.66 → 1577.44] 20,000 people, if only 1% of people are okay with it,
[1577.74 → 1582.20] that's 100 grand that a fodder could make selling their mod for five bucks.
[1582.84 → 1586.12] So even if the community hates paid mods,
[1586.84 → 1591.04] the vast majority are just unanimous about this.
[1591.64 → 1592.94] Well, that's not unanimous enough.
[1593.08 → 1593.54] Interesting.
[1593.84 → 1594.04] Sorry?
[1594.40 → 1595.26] Sorry, you're saying?
[1595.90 → 1598.84] If only 1% is okay and buys the mod,
[1598.98 → 1601.44] that's 100 grand in revenue for that mod.
[1601.44 → 1605.62] I think it would end up being the 1% conversion rate.
[1605.86 → 1606.16] Yes, I know.
[1606.40 → 1606.64] Okay.
[1606.90 → 1607.02] Yeah.
[1607.14 → 1611.04] 1% is optimistic for basically just at all.
[1611.28 → 1615.62] Maybe it would be more like 1% of that 1% that is okay with it,
[1615.62 → 1618.12] which would still be $1,000.
[1618.72 → 1621.18] Which is still money.
[1621.28 → 1622.24] It's a lot more than zero.
[1622.44 → 1622.60] Yeah.
[1622.72 → 1626.82] And I think that if you have a mod that has mainstream enough appeal,
[1627.06 → 1629.34] you might be able to convert it greater than 1%.
[1629.34 → 1633.42] That and I think we know from the DLSS 3 mod sales
[1633.42 → 1636.90] that that conversion rate is probably pretty good.
[1636.98 → 1639.80] The number of gamers that are willing to accept paid mods
[1639.80 → 1641.86] seems to be higher than 1%.
[1641.86 → 1642.94] 6 million.
[1642.94 → 1643.88] Okay, there you go.
[1644.16 → 1645.80] Biggest Bethesda game launch of all time.
[1645.94 → 1646.14] Yeah.
[1646.32 → 1646.96] And it's not on PlayStation.
[1647.18 → 1650.64] So that would be 6,000 now.
[1650.92 → 1656.26] Even if you only convert 1% of your 1% of total possible customers.
[1656.46 → 1661.20] That is an enormous pool to tap into,
[1661.34 → 1664.44] even if it's a tiny fraction of the total gamers that play Starfield.
[1665.68 → 1669.74] So I think the community is just going to decide.
[1669.74 → 1673.54] And I think that if we're being honest, we know what the answer is.
[1674.34 → 1676.24] Some people are going to be doing paid mods now.
[1676.48 → 1677.30] Paid mods are here to stay.
[1677.60 → 1679.24] If I have to make a prediction,
[1679.64 → 1681.92] what I would say is it's just going to split into two camps.
[1682.44 → 1682.80] Okay.
[1682.80 → 1686.76] I think there's going to be a paid modding camp.
[1687.12 → 1689.14] And I think there's going to be a free modding camp
[1689.14 → 1691.78] because I think there's a very significant community of people
[1691.78 → 1698.02] who learn digital art or digital audio or development
[1698.02 → 1700.08] or whatever else through modding games.
[1700.22 → 1701.72] And they're still going to have a lot of fun with it.
[1701.72 → 1705.18] I think a lot of people still view these things as passion projects
[1705.18 → 1712.88] or will be creating a mod that they don't necessarily think they could sell.
[1713.00 → 1714.04] Maybe it's too minor.
[1714.26 → 1717.52] Maybe it's one of those things that's going to end up in the list of 900 mods, whatever.
[1718.04 → 1724.60] But I do think you'll get some major mods that will cost money.
[1725.20 → 1727.60] Now, shit's about to get real, Luke.
[1727.60 → 1735.12] You saw NVIDIA's tech demo where they added ray traced lighting to Borrowing
[1735.12 → 1737.94] with a bunch of replaced assets and stuff like that.
[1738.10 → 1739.24] I mean, on a scale.
[1739.24 → 1740.54] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[1740.58 → 1741.06] Just stop it.
[1741.34 → 1742.24] You're doing the thing again.
[1743.06 → 1744.02] We're even now.
[1746.72 → 1747.16] Okay.
[1747.36 → 1748.40] Let me set this up.
[1748.58 → 1748.70] Okay.
[1750.16 → 1752.38] If it looked pretty cool, right?
[1752.72 → 1755.78] Out of 10, how cool would you say that that looked?
[1755.90 → 1756.90] To me, like 10.
[1756.90 → 1757.30] Yeah.
[1757.40 → 1758.12] I know.
[1758.24 → 1759.20] Because I'm a hyper Borrowing mod.
[1759.22 → 1760.16] Big Borrowing guy.
[1760.16 → 1760.60] Or a fan.
[1760.74 → 1760.86] Yeah.
[1761.00 → 1761.14] Yeah.
[1761.28 → 1761.54] Okay.
[1764.26 → 1766.20] That mod comes out.
[1766.46 → 1768.12] It looks just like that.
[1768.32 → 1771.04] The whole flipping game looks like that.
[1771.96 → 1773.52] It costs $50.
[1774.68 → 1775.20] Do you buy...
[1775.20 → 1776.12] Yeah, he's already nodding.
[1777.98 → 1779.36] So that's the thing, right?
[1779.60 → 1783.56] Is that it's not only just your principled stance on it.
[1783.82 → 1785.78] It's also how bad do you want it?
[1785.78 → 1786.32] Well, no.
[1786.42 → 1787.20] I don't think that's it.
[1787.24 → 1792.38] Because my principled stance isn't that someone doing work to develop something that's super
[1792.38 → 1793.74] cool should be not paid for it.
[1793.74 → 1794.66] But this is not donation.
[1794.74 → 1795.50] That's not my stance.
[1795.62 → 1796.36] This is...
[1796.36 → 1796.94] No, I understand.
[1797.74 → 1798.00] Okay.
[1798.12 → 1798.64] What if...
[1798.64 → 1798.76] Here.
[1798.96 → 1799.24] Okay.
[1799.24 → 1799.76] Let's...
[1799.76 → 1800.24] Let's...
[1800.24 → 1802.34] Let's sicken the deal.
[1803.30 → 1805.00] The mod has Denuvo.
[1805.84 → 1806.18] Oof.
[1806.38 → 1806.62] Okay.
[1806.68 → 1807.88] I might actually not do it then.
[1808.44 → 1809.32] It has Denuvo.
[1809.56 → 1810.00] It's $20.
[1810.30 → 1811.66] I am particularly against Denuvo.
[1811.66 → 1812.20] I just want to...
[1812.20 → 1813.08] I just want to...
[1813.08 → 1813.10] I just want to...
[1813.10 → 1813.74] I just want to...
[1813.74 → 1814.66] You know, it's $20.
[1815.06 → 1815.94] It looks like that.
[1816.00 → 1816.68] It runs great.
[1817.64 → 1818.06] It's $20.
[1818.30 → 1818.86] It has Denuvo.
[1819.76 → 1820.18] I don't...
[1820.18 → 1820.64] Look at him.
[1820.64 → 1820.98] Look at him.
[1820.98 → 1821.74] He's thinking about it.
[1821.74 → 1825.40] Yeah, I'm thinking because there are games that looked really cool that I have specifically
[1825.40 → 1827.18] not purchased because I hate Denuvo.
[1827.34 → 1828.18] Were they Borrowing?
[1828.40 → 1828.66] No.
[1830.70 → 1832.46] This is not a very fair example.
[1833.00 → 1833.44] Jerk.
[1833.58 → 1834.12] I know.
[1834.26 → 1834.52] I know.
[1834.56 → 1835.58] But that's the thing, right?
[1835.60 → 1835.78] No, I know.
[1835.84 → 1836.16] I get it.
[1836.16 → 1836.38] I get it.
[1836.38 → 1838.40] That's the point I'm trying to make is gamers are passionate.
[1838.76 → 1845.06] And sometimes the passion of gamers separates their money from their wallets at times when
[1845.06 → 1849.88] they know, like cognitively, logically, that they shouldn't be doing it.
[1850.02 → 1850.16] I think...
[1850.16 → 1851.42] We know we shouldn't pre-order.
[1851.74 → 1857.60] And yet 2 million concurrence were playing Starfield with the premium pre-order edition.
[1857.90 → 1858.06] Yeah.
[1858.48 → 1861.10] I think Denuvo would be a no for me.
[1863.50 → 1866.40] So I'd wait till I can crack Denuvo out.
[1868.22 → 1872.08] I'm not going to say I've never done that.
[1874.80 → 1878.48] So maybe there's what I'll call an alternative route.
[1880.20 → 1881.40] But yeah, I don't know.
[1881.40 → 1888.32] The point I was trying to make was just that this is not as cut and dried as, yes, always
[1888.32 → 1888.92] this way.
[1889.62 → 1890.84] No, never that way.
[1891.86 → 1892.94] Everyone's going to have their own...
[1892.94 → 1893.64] Like, okay.
[1893.64 → 1897.16] I kind of hate the way Nintendo behaves as a company.
[1897.28 → 1897.72] Yeah.
[1898.34 → 1900.30] But you still own a Switch and you still buy their new games.
[1900.36 → 1901.20] I keep giving them money.
[1901.30 → 1901.50] Yeah.
[1903.42 → 1906.94] Because I love video games.
[1907.32 → 1908.24] Like, I'm sorry.
[1909.14 → 1911.50] So the...
[1911.50 → 1912.84] They make fun video games.
[1913.46 → 1916.58] They also make, like, really stupid bad ones.
[1916.68 → 1918.32] But they make really fun ones, too.
[1918.42 → 1920.82] But Dan Vale said, gamers are not passionate.
[1920.94 → 1921.52] We're stupid.
[1921.76 → 1922.30] It's like, okay.
[1922.42 → 1923.68] Those aren't mutually exclusive.
[1923.88 → 1923.92] Yeah.
[1924.00 → 1924.42] They could be...
[1924.42 → 1924.78] Why not both?
[1924.78 → 1925.80] We can be both.
[1926.00 → 1926.20] Yeah.
[1926.32 → 1926.96] We are both.
[1927.02 → 1928.32] We can be stupidly passionate.
[1928.56 → 1928.72] Yeah.
[1928.72 → 1930.10] We can be passionately stupid.
[1930.34 → 1930.46] Yeah.
[1930.70 → 1931.02] Yeah.
[1931.36 → 1931.76] Yeah.
[1933.28 → 1933.76] All right.
[1933.80 → 1935.16] Why don't we jump into our next topic?
[1935.38 → 1936.12] But yeah, I don't know.
[1936.14 → 1937.46] Before we manage to insult everyone.
[1937.46 → 1938.20] I think it's complicated.
[1938.64 → 1940.08] I think pretty much everyone's mad.
[1940.38 → 1942.98] But I think this is just...
[1942.98 → 1946.32] I think that's less to do with what we said.
[1946.52 → 1949.80] Because I don't think either of us ever really took a firm stance on any of this.
[1950.24 → 1951.04] And more to do with...
[1951.04 → 1952.72] People are mad about my...
[1952.72 → 1958.26] I think the companies should be able to take some of the cut if they release Mod Tools thing.
[1958.56 → 1959.04] Oh, really?
[1959.04 → 1959.12] Really?
[1960.00 → 1961.12] Some people are mad about that.
[1962.14 → 1962.90] But I think...
[1962.90 → 1963.04] Okay.
[1963.12 → 1964.52] So here's my point there.
[1964.60 → 1965.70] But it's what the market will bear.
[1965.84 → 1966.00] Yeah.
[1966.00 → 1970.38] It's whether dodders choose to mod for that game knowing that that's the deal.
[1970.48 → 1971.80] If they change the deal.
[1972.04 → 1973.22] I strongly oppose that.
[1973.54 → 1977.28] If it starts out as these tools were free and...
[1977.28 → 1978.54] Oh, a lot of people are using this.
[1978.60 → 1979.94] This has added a lot of value to our...
[1979.94 → 1980.18] Oh!
[1980.18 → 1980.92] New rules!
[1981.02 → 1981.46] New rules!
[1981.82 → 1982.12] Yeah.
[1982.50 → 1983.18] That's not cool.
[1983.18 → 1985.74] What if the dodders using those tools start charging, though?
[1987.46 → 1987.74] Start...
[1987.74 → 1987.90] Oh!
[1987.90 → 1990.58] The scenario that I was talking about was...
[1990.58 → 1991.06] Yeah.
[1991.76 → 1992.80] Mods made through...
[1992.80 → 1994.72] Let's say Creation Kit comes out.
[1995.06 → 1997.06] Because it's not out for Starfield yet.
[1997.10 → 1999.60] So this applies to none of the mods that are out currently.
[1999.70 → 2002.12] It's free and everyone releases mods for free.
[2002.26 → 2005.90] But then all of a sudden dodders start charging and Bethesda's sitting there going...
[2006.94 → 2007.90] Excuse me?
[2007.96 → 2008.14] Pardon?
[2008.84 → 2009.88] And I don't know.
[2009.88 → 2015.08] I think Jaden's point about the modding cars thing is pretty valid.
[2015.28 → 2022.46] But then I think the counterpoint is that Bethesda put work into making the Creation Kit specifically.
[2022.62 → 2022.90] They did.
[2023.18 → 2023.68] Four mods.
[2024.74 → 2027.68] Knowing that they're going to sell a lot more copies of their game...
[2027.68 → 2028.00] Yes.
[2028.08 → 2033.04] ...with the longevity that the value that dodders create is going to add to it.
[2033.04 → 2034.72] So this is why I don't think...
[2034.72 → 2039.54] I think another way that I think this might be getting misconstrued is I'm not saying that they should.
[2041.04 → 2042.52] What I'm more saying is that they...
[2042.52 → 2043.20] They're within their rights.
[2043.20 → 2043.86] They could.
[2044.16 → 2045.72] And I would understand why.
[2046.32 → 2046.50] Right.
[2046.78 → 2047.02] Yeah.
[2047.02 → 2049.26] I think it would often...
[2049.26 → 2056.12] For something like Schofield, I think it would be a deeply unintelligent move.
[2056.22 → 2056.56] Starfield.
[2056.72 → 2057.04] But yes.
[2057.18 → 2057.38] Yeah.
[2057.48 → 2057.68] Sorry.
[2057.80 → 2058.24] What did I say?
[2058.42 → 2058.86] Schofield.
[2059.00 → 2059.52] It was really close.
[2059.60 → 2059.92] Sick.
[2060.16 → 2060.28] Yeah.
[2060.58 → 2061.96] More Field.
[2062.22 → 2063.60] More Oblivion.
[2065.24 → 2070.02] But yeah, I think it would be stupid because honestly, in the state that they release the games...
[2070.02 → 2073.84] For PC, it needs mods.
[2074.56 → 2076.16] You need UI mods.
[2076.26 → 2077.26] You need all this other stuff.
[2078.16 → 2082.42] And I think the reason why Skyrim had the legs on it that it did was the modding community.
[2082.74 → 2090.68] So I think if they screw up, and they're like, no, you can't release free mods, and we're taking a cut of all the paid mods, something like that.
[2090.80 → 2092.86] I think that would be just an incredibly stupid move.
[2092.94 → 2094.38] There's also degrees of taking a cut.
[2094.38 → 2104.16] If Bethesda came out and said, look, we've got this marketplace, and we've got to cover transaction fees and make it worthwhile to maintain this darn thing.
[2104.28 → 2106.32] We need 10 to 15% or something like that.
[2106.34 → 2107.72] I don't think that's entirely unreasonable.
[2108.18 → 2110.08] Whereas if they come in, and they say, yeah, it's 50-50.
[2111.00 → 2111.74] Oh, that's a lot.
[2111.76 → 2112.60] Then that's a lot, right?
[2112.98 → 2114.74] And there are games like, I think it's...
[2114.74 → 2117.44] Doesn't Roblox take like 90% or some insanity?
[2117.80 → 2117.96] Yeah.
[2118.60 → 2120.92] It's always shading of gray.
[2121.64 → 2123.70] What would you think about a slider system?
[2124.38 → 2125.60] Oh, like Humble Bundle?
[2125.80 → 2125.98] Yeah.
[2127.46 → 2128.62] I think that...
[2128.62 → 2129.84] This percentage goes to the...
[2129.84 → 2130.74] And you can go to zero.
[2130.96 → 2134.08] This percentage of the payment goes towards creation kit.
[2134.34 → 2135.30] This percentage of the payment goes towards the fodder.
[2135.30 → 2144.60] I think if you have that, you might as well just put 100% towards the fodder because even the most ardent fans of Bethesda games hate Bethesda.
[2145.88 → 2148.22] So they're all just going to zero you out?
[2148.22 → 2148.60] Yeah.
[2148.76 → 2151.84] I really think that that is not even a possibility.
[2152.18 → 2153.90] People going, you know what?
[2154.02 → 2155.38] 100% to Bethesda.
[2155.52 → 2156.20] Let's go.
[2156.28 → 2158.90] How many people do you think would skip changing the sliders though?
[2159.32 → 2161.10] Like if they put it like 80-20.
[2161.44 → 2162.64] 20% goes to creation kit.
[2162.70 → 2164.58] 80% goes to the mod creator.
[2164.58 → 2175.26] It depends on how many dark patterns are involved in the creation of this slider because Humble Bundle, for example, at least the last time I bought one, was like very front and centre.
[2175.36 → 2176.86] Hey, this is a slider.
[2177.08 → 2178.12] This is what it does.
[2178.20 → 2182.38] You must interact with this button before you can proceed and buy this bundle of games.
[2183.08 → 2187.40] So it's really going to depend on how Sneezy they are about the positioning of the slider.
[2187.54 → 2191.32] And I think that's something they could influence a lot.
[2191.32 → 2194.02] Another thing that I would say is...
[2194.02 → 2195.40] We're never going to move on from this topic.
[2195.56 → 2195.90] I tried.
[2196.08 → 2196.42] I tried.
[2196.42 → 2197.60] I have one last bit.
[2197.96 → 2201.18] Another thing that I would say is that if you're mad about my...
[2201.18 → 2205.28] Like, I think it could make sense for developers to take out if they make the modding tools.
[2208.06 → 2211.88] There's this stuff that's already out there.
[2212.78 → 2215.82] And if you're not mad, now's probably the time.
[2216.00 → 2217.56] If this is something that you want to stop.
[2219.20 → 2219.60] Yep.
[2220.00 → 2221.18] You pay for it.
[2221.32 → 2223.86] Wow.
[2224.56 → 2226.12] Minecraft Marketplace.
[2226.94 → 2227.26] There you go.
[2227.26 → 2231.76] It's interesting too because I noticed this, but Rare Loot, who I guess made Sky block.
[2231.84 → 2233.54] I haven't heard of these other ones, but Sky block.
[2235.30 → 2237.54] It has three out of four on the What's Popular.
[2238.66 → 2239.06] Wow.
[2239.20 → 2240.76] I don't know what the splits are here.
[2241.04 → 2242.40] I know nothing about this at all.
[2242.54 → 2246.00] It might only work with one type of Minecraft because I know there are a bunch of different types of Minecraft.
[2246.14 → 2247.02] I'm not a Minecraft person.
[2247.32 → 2247.84] I don't know.
[2247.84 → 2250.06] The way the pricing is done should be illegal.
[2250.06 → 2251.66] How it's obfuscated by coins?
[2251.82 → 2251.94] Yeah.
[2252.06 → 2252.66] Yeah, it's stupid.
[2252.84 → 2253.28] I hate it.
[2253.44 → 2263.48] The fact that this is marketed at kids and the fact that the pricing is hidden is extremely problematic.
[2263.48 → 2264.62] Yeah.
[2265.14 → 2267.84] And Conrad's saying, to be fair, Marketplace has some pretty great stuff.
[2267.94 → 2268.16] Yeah.
[2268.30 → 2273.56] And there's already amazing mods for Starfield.
[2274.30 → 2281.40] And there's mind-blowing, incredible, whole game quality mods for Skyrim.
[2281.40 → 2281.80] Yeah.
[2281.80 → 2281.84] Yeah.
[2282.20 → 2284.70] And Oblivion's coming out.
[2284.80 → 2285.94] There are amazing things.
[2286.16 → 2289.40] I'm catching up bits 2435 in the float plane chat.
[2289.56 → 2290.76] That's his whole point.
[2291.26 → 2294.06] He goes, are they just now complaining about this after years?
[2294.46 → 2294.70] No, no.
[2294.74 → 2295.66] That's his whole point.
[2295.66 → 2302.58] Is that if you're mad about this now, you kind of missed the boat a little bit.
[2302.58 → 2303.42] We've missed the boat a bit.
[2303.72 → 2304.26] And if you want to-
[2304.26 → 2306.34] You need to go back and be mad about-
[2306.34 → 2309.38] It's kind of like if you're mad about microtransactions and mobile gaming.
[2309.62 → 2312.08] You need to go back in time and be mad about Horse Armour.
[2312.24 → 2313.10] And some people were.
[2313.38 → 2314.04] And some people-
[2314.04 → 2314.30] I was.
[2314.30 → 2315.46] Because people were mad about Horse Armour.
[2315.46 → 2315.80] I didn't buy it.
[2315.80 → 2319.38] People were also mad about how Roblox has been around at all.
[2319.66 → 2320.06] Yep.
[2320.38 → 2327.02] But I think if this is something that the community wants to stand up against, you got to do it loud.
[2327.40 → 2330.68] And now, yeah.
[2331.22 → 2333.32] Yeah, it feels like we've-
[2333.32 → 2339.62] Honestly, it seems to me like we may have already reached a point of no return here.
[2339.62 → 2345.74] With that person who made the DLSS mod making 40 grand in a month, I get it.
[2345.80 → 2346.48] I guarantee you.
[2346.96 → 2348.98] It's a gold rush, essentially, at that point.
[2349.10 → 2355.32] As soon as one person makes a year's worth of income in a month-
[2355.32 → 2357.66] Whoa.
[2357.88 → 2358.62] You're going to have other-
[2358.62 → 2359.46] You're going to have people looking.
[2359.56 → 2366.50] There's going to be parents whose kids have fun modding games that are now pushing them to try to make it a career instead of a passion.
[2367.30 → 2372.14] Which is straight up going to make a bunch of things worse in a bunch of different ways.
[2372.24 → 2373.26] Why did I read Twitch chat?
[2373.62 → 2373.86] Yeah.
[2373.86 → 2376.14] Beating that horse armour to death at this point.
[2376.76 → 2377.92] But that's the point.
[2378.16 → 2381.32] It's the same company that we're entering this entire conversation around.
[2381.32 → 2383.94] And that was the start of microtransactions in gaming.
[2384.48 → 2393.18] That was that turning point when we had an opportunity to buy microtransaction crap after the fact or not buy it.
[2393.18 → 2394.90] And enough of the community-
[2394.90 → 2398.62] Back to my point about whether it's 1% or more.
[2398.88 → 2407.60] Enough of the community was willing to do that that Bethesda made enough money that other gaming companies stood up and took notice and went,
[2407.60 → 2410.62] This is the future of monetization in gaming.
[2410.62 → 2412.88] And that's what got us where we are today.
[2413.12 → 2415.92] And there was probably stuff that went on behind the scenes.
[2415.98 → 2419.00] And there were things that other companies were working on at the same time.
[2419.06 → 2429.56] It was just that it was one of the highest profile, most obviously successful in spite of how mad everybody was moments for microtransactions.
[2429.56 → 2432.78] And, yeah, we keep talking about that one.
[2432.92 → 2433.10] Why?
[2433.22 → 2434.50] Because that was the one.
[2435.38 → 2438.10] So we could talk about other ones, but then we'd be wrong.
[2440.16 → 2440.66] All right.
[2440.70 → 2442.56] Why don't we jump into...
[2443.48 → 2444.58] Oh, shoot.
[2444.64 → 2446.34] No, there was a thing that I had wanted to...
[2446.34 → 2446.86] Ah, it doesn't matter.
[2448.08 → 2449.32] What do you want to jump into next?
[2450.18 → 2451.66] Nintendo demos the Switch 2?
[2451.86 → 2452.26] Sure.
[2452.60 → 2453.92] Or whatever it is.
[2453.92 → 2463.48] According to multiple sources, Nintendo held a closed-door demonstration of the successor to the Switch for developers at Gamescom last month.
[2464.14 → 2468.80] The demonstration used to target specs of the new console to run both.
[2468.92 → 2470.02] The demonstration used...
[2470.02 → 2473.92] Oh, the demo used the target specs of the console.
[2474.80 → 2476.66] I just got a like, oh no moment.
[2476.94 → 2477.16] What?
[2478.28 → 2481.62] $40,000 for a graphical feature.
[2482.56 → 2483.08] Yeah.
[2483.08 → 2488.56] That could be a microtransaction from the company itself.
[2488.72 → 2488.90] Yeah.
[2489.50 → 2490.36] Yeah, that sucks.
[2490.92 → 2492.42] I didn't think about that until right now.
[2492.50 → 2492.68] Yeah.
[2493.18 → 2494.34] That was sort of...
[2494.34 → 2494.70] Oh, sorry.
[2495.06 → 2500.06] That was what I was getting at with, like, doubling the cost of the game and, like, $300 for the game and stuff like that.
[2500.08 → 2500.56] No, no, no, no, no.
[2500.72 → 2501.10] I know.
[2501.24 → 2501.58] I know.
[2501.82 → 2505.64] And the company could ship it without DLSS 3 and be like, yeah, it's another $5.
[2506.42 → 2507.72] Or without ultra textures.
[2508.50 → 2511.10] I mean, it's basically just a first-party texture mod.
[2511.32 → 2511.68] Yeah.
[2511.80 → 2512.40] Do you want...
[2512.40 → 2513.06] Oh, my God.
[2513.08 → 2513.96] Yeah, I know.
[2513.96 → 2516.26] Do you want the low-tier version of this game?
[2516.34 → 2516.62] I know.
[2517.12 → 2519.80] This is a cool game that has six different endings.
[2519.92 → 2523.14] Or you can get up to 12 different endings for another $10.
[2523.48 → 2525.14] That's already sort of a thing, yeah.
[2525.66 → 2530.30] The thing that's blowing my mind, I guess, is the settings behind a microtransaction.
[2530.76 → 2532.98] Because there's already been content, for sure.
[2532.98 → 2534.98] But I don't think I've seen settings.
[2536.44 → 2539.76] I mean, is a texture pack not a setting?
[2541.12 → 2542.16] It's kind of content.
[2542.50 → 2543.58] It's kind of a setting.
[2543.78 → 2544.44] Which one is it?
[2544.50 → 2545.06] I don't know.
[2545.20 → 2547.04] It's riding the line.
[2547.86 → 2548.02] Yeah.
[2548.32 → 2548.48] Yeah.
[2548.60 → 2549.20] It's right there.
[2549.20 → 2550.62] It could be sort of...
[2550.62 → 2550.88] It's right there.
[2550.94 → 2551.80] It could fall on this side.
[2552.04 → 2553.16] It could fall on this side.
[2553.16 → 2555.36] I don't know which side it's going to fall on.
[2555.68 → 2556.22] I hate it.
[2556.30 → 2556.48] Okay.
[2556.60 → 2557.18] Switch 2.
[2557.36 → 2557.90] Run away.
[2558.08 → 2558.96] We got to talk about this thing.
[2559.06 → 2559.20] Sorry.
[2559.30 → 2559.42] Go.
[2561.82 → 2562.18] Okay.
[2562.36 → 2562.62] All right.
[2562.78 → 2564.34] Occasionally, it's okay to look at Twitch chat.
[2564.56 → 2565.36] Dark Matter Synthesis.
[2565.62 → 2567.34] Yes, I was mad over horse armour.
[2567.34 → 2571.26] The problem is we already know gamers don't have any willpower to say no.
[2571.38 → 2572.44] We are f***ed.
[2572.60 → 2572.74] Yep.
[2573.02 → 2573.26] Yep.
[2573.32 → 2574.12] That's 100% true.
[2574.66 → 2574.92] All right.
[2574.98 → 2576.28] Nintendo demos the Switch 2.
[2576.38 → 2578.94] Speaking of having no willpower, I'm probably going to buy it.
[2578.94 → 2585.36] But the demonstration used the whatever it was, whether it was a developer kit or whether
[2585.36 → 2591.04] it was a prototype, you know, we don't know what it is, to run both at higher frame rates
[2591.04 → 2597.94] and higher resolution in Breath of the Wild and the Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 tech demo
[2597.94 → 2602.34] that was originally created in 2021 to show off the capabilities of the PlayStation 5 and
[2602.34 → 2603.70] the Xbox Series X.
[2603.70 → 2611.62] It apparently is capable of both ray tracing and current-gen HD visuals using NVIDIA's DLSS AI upscaling,
[2611.74 → 2614.60] which, can I just say, called it.
[2615.52 → 2617.26] I called this hard.
[2617.38 → 2625.08] I was like, man, Switch 2 should just use DLSS to have, like, a way better, like, TV gaming experience
[2625.08 → 2628.60] without necessarily needing to move past mobile-capable hardware.
[2628.90 → 2630.82] What does current-gen HD mean?
[2631.54 → 2632.28] I don't know.
[2632.28 → 2636.56] I was actually, I was, yes, I was, I was, I was going to come back to that.
[2636.76 → 2637.16] Okay.
[2637.82 → 2638.96] Sorry, you can keep going.
[2639.00 → 2642.04] Nope, you can keep going because I just got signed out of my Google account.
[2642.18 → 2642.62] Oh, boy.
[2642.96 → 2648.12] Other reports have corroborated that a Switch sequel is in the works and that key partners
[2648.12 → 2649.94] already have dev kits in hand.
[2650.08 → 2654.66] It's possible that a launch could come as early as the final quarter of 2024.
[2654.96 → 2655.18] Really?
[2655.30 → 2655.68] You think so?
[2655.82 → 2659.06] But Nintendo has made no public commitments at this point.
[2659.08 → 2660.02] Well, it depends on what it is.
[2660.02 → 2667.36] If it's a completely new gaming experience, a la Nintendo Wii, then, yeah, it's probably
[2667.36 → 2668.04] going to be a minute.
[2668.04 → 2672.76] Because if developers are just getting dev kits now, unless they're going to rush these
[2672.76 → 2675.84] games out in a year, I mean, good flippin' luck, right?
[2676.20 → 2680.60] Then again, it wouldn't be the first time that Nintendo gave their own internal teams lots
[2680.60 → 2684.40] of time to work on something and external teams less time.
[2686.78 → 2687.94] Where was I going with this?
[2688.62 → 2689.02] Right.
[2689.02 → 2695.70] But if it's more of a Wii U, where it's like kind of that thing, but with a gimmick or,
[2695.86 → 2698.84] you know, more different, then no.
[2699.02 → 2701.16] I mean, I think it could be realistic.
[2701.30 → 2706.00] Like, if you just plug in Breath of the Wild, and since everything's online anyway, it just
[2706.00 → 2711.34] downloads, you know, new higher resolution textures or something to your console, and then you
[2711.34 → 2714.92] just run the game from your internal storage or something like that.
[2714.92 → 2720.74] Yeah, I don't see why a new console that takes the same basic game cartridges, but then just
[2720.74 → 2724.48] runs them at higher resolution and higher frame rate couldn't come out soon.
[2724.98 → 2730.28] And it might launch without any particular blockbuster game available for it.
[2731.36 → 2731.98] I don't know.
[2732.02 → 2736.60] I have kind of a conspiracy theory here that Tears of the Kingdom was supposed to be a
[2736.60 → 2737.60] next-gen Switch title.
[2738.36 → 2741.36] That that would have been what they did.
[2741.56 → 2743.32] Honestly, it would have made a lot of sense.
[2743.32 → 2747.04] It would have made a ton of sense, but I wonder if it was just a matter of, you know,
[2747.40 → 2749.64] the timing not being quite right.
[2749.88 → 2757.16] You know, maybe Alta Lovelace came too late, and Nintendo really wanted the improvement.
[2757.38 → 2760.48] Man, give NVIDIA flack all you want.
[2760.84 → 2761.34] Go for it.
[2761.38 → 2761.62] Do it.
[2761.68 → 2762.70] Give NVIDIA some flack.
[2763.24 → 2765.68] They're big, mean jerks.
[2765.80 → 2766.10] Okay.
[2766.50 → 2767.28] That was...
[2767.28 → 2769.10] They don't care about gamers anymore.
[2769.20 → 2770.00] Truly powerful words.
[2770.06 → 2770.50] Thank you, Luke.
[2771.34 → 2772.96] Give them flack all you want.
[2772.96 → 2775.26] 40 series is flippin' efficient.
[2775.82 → 2776.08] Yes.
[2776.30 → 2777.34] Really efficient.
[2777.54 → 2778.26] Also very expensive.
[2779.12 → 2780.16] And very efficient.
[2780.94 → 2783.04] And I find has a lot of issues.
[2783.28 → 2784.18] Expensive, efficient.
[2784.84 → 2785.96] Mobile Nintendo handheld.
[2786.22 → 2786.92] Match made in heaven.
[2787.88 → 2792.12] So I had kind of this theory around the time that Tears of the Kingdom was coming out
[2792.12 → 2794.96] that it seemed kind of overdue.
[2795.04 → 2800.22] Like, it kind of seemed like this should have been the launch title for the next big Nintendo console,
[2800.34 → 2803.54] if it was going to be a Switch successor, which at the time was...
[2803.54 → 2804.88] It was rumoured to be.
[2805.44 → 2808.02] But what I kind of wonder is if it matters.
[2808.34 → 2810.44] I wonder if Nintendo looked at it and went,
[2810.92 → 2811.58] Holy smokes.
[2811.96 → 2814.56] The Switch and the Switch OLED are still selling.
[2814.90 → 2818.40] Not as well as they used to, but they are still selling.
[2818.78 → 2820.34] Do we need a launch title?
[2820.88 → 2824.14] Or do we just have better hardware?
[2824.68 → 2826.48] And you can plug in all the same games.
[2826.52 → 2827.96] And we're going to continue making games.
[2828.02 → 2831.94] And those games will continue selling consoles the same way that they always do
[2831.94 → 2835.58] because we're flippin' Nintendo, and we make great games that people want to play.
[2836.94 → 2841.40] And, you know, honestly, I talked about this back when the Xbox series came out.
[2841.40 → 2847.88] My theory was that the Series S and the Series X were just the tip of the iceberg.
[2848.12 → 2850.94] As it turns out, I haven't been correct, at least not yet.
[2850.94 → 2857.68] But what I thought was that the Series name, which otherwise seemed phenomenally stupid to me,
[2857.76 → 2860.34] like I couldn't come up with any other reason for it.
[2860.46 → 2866.40] I thought the Series name meant that it was kind of the last generation of Xbox.
[2867.26 → 2871.90] And from then on, we were just going to get essentially PCs and Xbox clothing,
[2872.20 → 2873.92] and they would just get upgrades.
[2873.94 → 2876.96] That's what was like vaguely communicated at the time.
[2877.12 → 2880.76] And the games would just kind of run better depending on which one it is.
[2880.76 → 2887.22] And I thought that the whole point of Series S, Series X was that they were priming game developers
[2887.22 → 2895.54] and the community for just, you know, Boxes that are just gaming boxes that can be less powerful or more powerful.
[2895.72 → 2899.46] And it was, you know, it was already kind of happening in the previous generation.
[2900.28 → 2902.46] So I don't know.
[2902.52 → 2904.20] I haven't been right about that yet.
[2904.28 → 2905.06] But who knows?
[2905.48 → 2910.86] Maybe Nintendo will be the one to do it and just kind of go, okay, yeah, we'll just like to upgrade the hardware once in a while
[2910.86 → 2914.40] and keep building gaming experiences for this platform.
[2914.48 → 2924.40] It'll run at 720p, 30fps on this one, or 60, and then it'll run at, you know, 1080p, 60, or 120 on this one.
[2924.46 → 2926.32] And we'll do another one a few years later.
[2926.32 → 2929.02] It'll run at 4K or whatever the case may be, 1440p.
[2930.22 → 2931.04] I don't know.
[2932.40 → 2936.14] Avon Fox says, upgradable Xbox, let's go.
[2936.26 → 2939.30] Okay, that I'm not expecting to happen anytime soon.
[2939.32 → 2939.48] Yeah, big doubt.
[2939.48 → 2949.74] So with all that in mind, the real discussion here, even though we managed to talk about this for a lot longer than I expected, was what is your dream?
[2949.82 → 2953.28] Now, you bought a Switch at some point and then returned it, if I recall correctly?
[2953.28 → 2954.50] No, I still have my Switch.
[2954.56 → 2955.22] You do still have a Switch.
[2955.32 → 2956.46] I played it quite well.
[2956.58 → 2961.38] Technically, so I had a Switch, and then I modded it.
[2961.38 → 2967.00] So I replaced the backing with that, like, translucent purple, like, retro Nintendo style stuff.
[2967.00 → 2967.22] Nice.
[2967.22 → 2968.70] I actually used it quite a bit back then.
[2968.70 → 2970.54] How dare you call the N64 retro?
[2970.66 → 2971.06] I hate you.
[2971.82 → 2973.16] It just makes me feel ancient.
[2973.26 → 2973.36] It absolutely is.
[2974.24 → 2976.42] I had one too, man, when it was current.
[2977.04 → 2977.94] Or did we get it?
[2978.06 → 2979.46] I think we got it the generation after.
[2979.54 → 2980.34] But whatever, it doesn't matter.
[2983.08 → 2985.60] Yeah, but then my parents, like, stopped working.
[2986.04 → 2987.62] So I was like, I'll fix it.
[2987.64 → 2988.72] You can take mine while I do that.
[2988.78 → 2990.32] And then I brought it home, and I turned it on.
[2990.92 → 2992.18] And it's never had a problem since.
[2992.18 → 2995.06] So I'm technically using my parents, and they're technically using mine.
[2995.32 → 2995.68] I see.
[2995.98 → 2996.56] But they function.
[2996.56 → 2997.78] So whatever.
[2998.48 → 2999.66] But yes, I still have a Switch.
[2999.82 → 3000.48] Long story short.
[3000.70 → 3000.86] Yeah.
[3000.94 → 3001.50] Okay, cool.
[3001.98 → 3007.64] So then, the whole idea here behind this topic was laying out kind of what we think will
[3007.64 → 3009.66] happen and what we want to happen.
[3010.30 → 3014.62] First, why don't we take turns?
[3015.40 → 3016.20] My wish list?
[3017.24 → 3018.84] Easily backupable save games.
[3019.72 → 3021.06] No cloud subscription required.
[3021.06 → 3022.16] I want it.
[3022.16 → 3024.28] I think it is not going to happen.
[3025.52 → 3026.46] What do you want?
[3026.60 → 3027.34] What do you think will happen?
[3027.34 → 3040.98] I want a bit of a return to more fun local party games.
[3041.30 → 3041.64] Okay.
[3041.64 → 3042.28] That's content.
[3042.40 → 3043.18] That's not the console.
[3043.18 → 3043.54] Yeah.
[3043.66 → 3048.38] But in my opinion, that's a lot of what Nintendo stuff has been forever.
[3048.38 → 3055.02] I don't think the actual quality of the console has almost ever been a real selling point.
[3056.22 → 3056.66] N64?
[3056.66 → 3060.42] Like, the quality of the Wii was not really the selling point of the Wii.
[3060.42 → 3060.64] No.
[3060.82 → 3062.04] No, you have to go back farther than that.
[3062.06 → 3062.56] It was the content.
[3062.72 → 3065.10] N64, like, it's right in the name.
[3065.18 → 3067.16] It's like, it's 64-bit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3067.16 → 3068.66] Like, it was a huge push.
[3069.06 → 3070.22] They actually had the...
[3070.22 → 3072.50] I did that unboxing on Short Circuit recently.
[3072.50 → 3074.82] You had your RAM upgrade or whatever that was?
[3074.98 → 3077.28] They had the frequency of the chip on the box.
[3077.90 → 3080.72] That is such a not Nintendo thing to do these days.
[3080.92 → 3081.24] It really is.
[3081.24 → 3083.92] It'll tell you how many gigahertz the Switch runs at.
[3084.18 → 3084.40] Yeah.
[3085.06 → 3085.30] Yeah.
[3086.62 → 3088.16] But yeah, I think that's it.
[3088.90 → 3092.80] Because, like, honestly, I enjoyed the...
[3092.80 → 3095.64] Oh, this is going to be time for a spicy take.
[3095.72 → 3096.74] I enjoyed my Wii.
[3096.88 → 3097.68] The Wii U.
[3098.20 → 3098.66] I know.
[3098.86 → 3099.12] I know.
[3099.26 → 3100.36] More than I enjoyed the Switch.
[3101.06 → 3104.46] Because the Wii U is more fun to have people over and play games on.
[3104.58 → 3105.22] Yeah, that's fair.
[3107.10 → 3108.08] There was like...
[3108.08 → 3110.90] And not that anyone played it, because no one bought a Wii U.
[3111.28 → 3113.90] But that Super Mario Bros. game that came out for Wii U.
[3114.32 → 3115.60] That had the fifth player.
[3116.00 → 3120.22] And the fifth player had their own screen on the built-in screen handheld.
[3120.40 → 3122.08] That had its own gameplay style and stuff.
[3122.38 → 3124.36] That was really fun.
[3125.06 → 3128.28] Really fun and not doable on any console that wasn't a Wii U.
[3128.58 → 3133.90] Because you had to have that handheld screen on that extra controller.
[3134.04 → 3134.74] All that kind of stuff.
[3137.54 → 3138.38] So, I don't know.
[3138.38 → 3141.44] I don't know necessarily how the console would do it itself.
[3142.14 → 3148.88] But I feel like the Wii U and the Wii itself both invited development of that style.
[3149.20 → 3151.74] And the Switch invited single-player experiences.
[3152.24 → 3154.38] Yeah, I think that's really fair.
[3154.48 → 3163.64] I mean, obviously, neither you nor I have access to Nintendo's telemetry data for what percentage of playtime on the Switch is in handheld mode versus docked mode.
[3163.64 → 3165.64] But I would guess...
[3165.64 → 3167.24] I'm going to argue most of it's in handheld.
[3167.48 → 3169.12] I would guess the same thing.
[3169.58 → 3172.12] With no, like you're saying, data behind it.
[3172.28 → 3173.86] I just would argue that that's true.
[3174.72 → 3177.92] Well, with that in mind, I would like to see a higher refresh rate screen.
[3177.92 → 3179.62] I love the...
[3179.62 → 3180.84] I don't need to see 120Hz.
[3181.52 → 3182.66] I'd settle for 90.
[3183.12 → 3183.80] Even 75.
[3184.00 → 3185.44] Anything higher than 60.
[3185.62 → 3185.96] 90.
[3186.08 → 3187.22] I would be stoked on 90.
[3187.38 → 3189.00] I'd be very happy with 90.
[3189.06 → 3197.80] Because the thing is, the difference between 60 and 90 is way nicer than the difference between 90 and 120.
[3197.80 → 3203.74] And it just has to do with how much the reduction in frame time is between the two.
[3203.98 → 3210.24] I'm even going to go on a limb and say I would prefer 60 to 90 versus 90 to 150.
[3215.74 → 3216.18] Yes.
[3217.00 → 3217.46] I think...
[3217.46 → 3220.82] I'm not sure if like mathematically it quite works out to being better.
[3221.28 → 3221.80] But it's...
[3222.44 → 3225.02] I just care so much more about...
[3225.02 → 3228.96] Once you get to 90, I'm like pretty stoked on the experience, you know?
[3231.14 → 3234.46] Game grime in float plane chat.
[3234.96 → 3238.50] How about just 60 that's actually playable on hardware and handheld?
[3239.12 → 3240.26] How about just that even?
[3240.84 → 3241.12] Okay.
[3241.82 → 3244.36] The point of this is that it's a wish list.
[3244.48 → 3245.86] It's not a realism list.
[3246.04 → 3247.26] Because I don't think we're going to get it.
[3247.28 → 3248.24] I think we're going to get 60.
[3249.36 → 3251.26] This is something that I wanted.
[3251.46 → 3252.76] I don't know how they would do it.
[3252.76 → 3256.06] But I wanted some form of accelerator when you put it in a dock.
[3258.38 → 3260.18] I mean, that could be done USB 4.
[3260.36 → 3266.26] Like, there's no way that NVIDIA couldn't build a chip with some kind of USB 4 Thunderbolt implementation at this point.
[3266.50 → 3267.76] But like I want it to...
[3268.76 → 3275.10] I want there to be like a reason to dock it other than it goes on a TV screen.
[3275.28 → 3276.72] And you can see all them pixels.
[3277.94 → 3278.28] Hmm.
[3278.62 → 3278.98] Interesting.
[3279.98 → 3281.28] I, um...
[3283.84 → 3285.64] Oh, man.
[3285.74 → 3289.74] Just everything seems so unlikely somehow.
[3289.94 → 3291.62] And yet, obviously, they have to upgrade it.
[3291.82 → 3292.74] Here's what I want to know.
[3292.82 → 3293.00] Right.
[3293.24 → 3294.42] Back to my conspiracy theory.
[3294.48 → 3295.52] That's where I was going with this.
[3295.94 → 3302.06] My conspiracy theory that they just like were going to have Switch 2 for Tears of the Kingdom and then just like didn't.
[3302.06 → 3309.72] I think that Steam Deck has put a lot of pressure on Nintendo to bother to update this thing.
[3311.14 → 3318.08] And if you look at the timing for when they might have kind of gone, okay, no, we actually seriously do need to actually freaking develop this thing.
[3318.08 → 3321.32] It's not that unbelievable.
[3323.00 → 3325.52] Because it doesn't necessarily have to be right when Steam Deck launches.
[3325.64 → 3330.48] It could be that it's been like a slow pressure build as the Steam Deck launched.
[3330.48 → 3332.12] And then gamers really liked it.
[3332.18 → 3337.14] And then emulators not only existed but got super easy to use.
[3337.14 → 3340.82] And oh my goodness, our games run better on it.
[3341.28 → 3351.10] Like there might have just been like a wake-up, a slow wake-up process at Nintendo to the fact that they have competition in handheld gaming again.
[3352.54 → 3358.12] Because that's the biggest reason that I can think of that Nintendo needs a sequel for the Switch.
[3358.48 → 3361.96] Is that they own handheld gaming.
[3362.56 → 3365.70] They have tons of competition when it comes to living room gaming.
[3365.70 → 3368.68] And they have basically forever.
[3369.28 → 3371.68] But they have owned handheld gaming.
[3372.54 → 3374.20] Basically forever.
[3375.40 → 3383.36] And so for Nintendo, you know, I would see them losing the living room race as, you know, a problem.
[3383.98 → 3389.24] But I think to them, losing the handheld race is an existential threat.
[3389.70 → 3391.08] If that kind of makes sense.
[3391.08 → 3395.68] And I could see that lighting a serious, serious fire under their butts.
[3395.68 → 3401.40] We are supposed to now explain and do a couple merch messages.
[3401.40 → 3403.50] So we already kind of covered this earlier in the show.
[3403.60 → 3413.40] But for those of you who are just joining us, merch messages are our alternative to Super Chats or Twitch Bits or otherwise hacking money at the screen and hoping that Sendai notices you.
[3413.40 → 3418.88] So what you do is you go on LTTstore.com, and you check out any of the cool items we have there.
[3419.06 → 3422.08] Like, whoa, we have a wrist let keychain now.
[3422.14 → 3422.80] A new series of pins.
[3422.88 → 3423.88] And what is this?
[3425.46 → 3428.70] A Luke Nuke t-shirt design.
[3428.84 → 3429.00] What?
[3429.82 → 3430.80] Hold on a second.
[3431.24 → 3432.34] Wait, Dan's got a box.
[3432.40 → 3433.50] He's going to throw it at us.
[3433.62 → 3434.08] Whoa, Mike.
[3434.26 → 3434.56] Okay.
[3434.56 → 3438.72] For Luke plus Linus, but mostly Luke.
[3438.82 → 3439.98] P.S. LTTstore.com.
[3440.20 → 3440.96] What is this?
[3441.12 → 3441.34] What?
[3442.36 → 3445.44] Your water bottle is right in the way of the thing you're opening.
[3445.58 → 3445.86] Of course it was.
[3445.86 → 3446.60] You're doing great, Luke.
[3447.08 → 3447.32] Yeah.
[3447.46 → 3447.74] Sorry.
[3448.02 → 3450.02] Well, it kind of matches the colour of the shirt a little bit.
[3451.04 → 3451.80] So hold on.
[3451.90 → 3453.76] This one's going to be yours for sure.
[3453.86 → 3456.06] I actually don't even remember the full.
[3456.06 → 3458.38] Are you going to wear my face on your body?
[3458.58 → 3459.08] Of course I am.
[3459.08 → 3459.62] Heck yeah.
[3459.72 → 3461.62] I don't even remember the full context for this.
[3461.62 → 3465.92] I think it was like you trying to stop me from destroying the channel or something like that.
[3466.28 → 3467.64] That probably sounds about right.
[3467.68 → 3468.36] Yeah, I don't remember.
[3468.86 → 3469.76] I love this.
[3469.96 → 3470.42] Twitch chat.
[3470.52 → 3471.60] Always with the good takes.
[3471.84 → 3472.72] Nobody will buy that.
[3472.80 → 3475.38] Twitch chat, do you have any idea how many of these we've sold already?
[3475.76 → 3475.96] What?
[3476.04 → 3476.26] Really?
[3477.40 → 3478.14] Look at it.
[3478.76 → 3479.72] It's fucking awesome.
[3479.80 → 3482.04] I mean, I think it's cool, but I don't know.
[3482.16 → 3484.72] I hazard to assume people would put my face on their body.
[3485.10 → 3485.98] I mean, I'm going to do it.
[3486.20 → 3486.58] Hey.
[3487.36 → 3487.76] Hey.
[3488.36 → 3489.14] Let's go.
[3489.14 → 3493.26] I give it like a couple of months before someone has a tattoo of this on their body.
[3494.32 → 3495.84] That would be amazing.
[3497.30 → 3498.04] Luke Nuke.
[3498.68 → 3503.16] I remember saying nuke a bunch of times on a stream, but I don't remember why.
[3503.46 → 3507.20] Like I said, I also do not remember the full context for this.
[3507.36 → 3510.56] All I know is that I think Sarah did a bang up job of this.
[3510.62 → 3511.48] Oh, it looks great.
[3511.62 → 3513.14] I appreciate how...
[3513.14 → 3517.58] I appreciate the muscularity that she gave me.
[3517.66 → 3518.36] That's pretty fantastic.
[3518.70 → 3518.72] Yeah.
[3518.72 → 3521.64] I was going to comment on that.
[3522.64 → 3525.02] Be like, hey, we actually...
[3525.02 → 3530.80] Oh, I don't know if the other designers passed their 90-day initial probation period,
[3531.00 → 3533.84] but there was some help from one of the other designers as well.
[3533.84 → 3536.44] So Sarah and one of our other designers were together on it.
[3537.00 → 3539.02] Oh, I can just switch to my cam if you just want to stay there.
[3539.12 → 3539.26] Boom.
[3540.28 → 3540.64] Anyway.
[3540.90 → 3541.16] Yep.
[3541.98 → 3542.74] Freaking cool.
[3543.18 → 3543.86] I love it.
[3543.92 → 3545.62] You guys can check that out at LTT Store.
[3546.02 → 3547.16] We've also got...
[3547.16 → 3548.74] Oh, how does this work?
[3549.04 → 3552.78] Am I able to have Linus laptop and Linus cam, or are we going to show nipples on Twitch?
[3553.38 → 3553.56] Hey.
[3553.60 → 3554.30] You totally can.
[3554.36 → 3554.88] That does work.
[3554.96 → 3555.42] Super cool.
[3556.08 → 3556.36] Right.
[3556.36 → 3561.96] So we've also got new versions of the lanyard that are just, you know, more of like a bracelet.
[3562.22 → 3565.46] They can, you know, you clip onto a thing or clip onto other more different thing.
[3565.54 → 3567.46] Not everybody likes a huge long lanyard.
[3568.00 → 3570.72] And then Series 2 pins.
[3571.94 → 3573.60] This is a really fun collection.
[3573.82 → 3575.32] Sarah did a really great job.
[3575.58 → 3579.40] The hard drive pin is mirrored, so it's super, super shiny.
[3579.56 → 3582.36] It's kind of hard to tell from that picture, but there it is.
[3582.70 → 3586.16] I would like to point out that this is not, in fact, infringing.
[3586.36 → 3586.88] And BMO.
[3587.26 → 3587.52] Okay.
[3587.56 → 3590.00] This is the little character from the ABCs of gaming.
[3590.18 → 3590.64] Oh, sorry.
[3590.86 → 3592.42] No, I'm just showing how shiny...
[3592.42 → 3593.60] Oh, now it's harder to see.
[3593.94 → 3594.26] Go back.
[3594.42 → 3595.54] That is actually worse.
[3595.82 → 3596.58] Good job, Linus.
[3596.60 → 3597.42] You see how shiny it is.
[3597.48 → 3598.48] Yeah, that's the hard drive pin.
[3599.22 → 3600.08] Give it a sec, Luke.
[3600.12 → 3601.32] I can go to the big one.
[3601.54 → 3604.00] We've got the short circuit blocks, and then...
[3604.00 → 3607.90] Which, by the way, if you look closely, this is an S.
[3608.82 → 3609.18] Okay.
[3609.18 → 3610.36] And this is a C.
[3611.76 → 3612.16] Whoa.
[3612.34 → 3612.96] Yeah, I know, right?
[3615.06 → 3615.42] Anywho.
[3615.62 → 3616.14] All right.
[3616.36 → 3617.80] And a strawberry for no reason.
[3621.26 → 3622.38] Wow, I've never...
[3622.38 → 3622.62] Wow.
[3623.04 → 3624.32] I don't know how to feel about this.
[3624.96 → 3626.00] The art is fantastic.
[3626.38 → 3629.18] Wearing my own face and name on my body is a little weird.
[3629.24 → 3629.82] You get used to it.
[3630.64 → 3631.04] Yeah.
[3631.40 → 3633.84] I was going to ask you how you feel about that.
[3634.28 → 3635.14] You actually don't...
[3635.14 → 3636.74] Okay, I think some people get used to it.
[3636.74 → 3637.74] I actually...
[3637.74 → 3643.16] I only notice it sometimes now.
[3643.16 → 3653.26] Like, I'll have moments where I'll find someone's hoodie lying around, and I'll be frustrated because we issue people hoodies.
[3653.38 → 3656.48] Like, everyone gets a merch budget, and they can just request stuff.
[3656.48 → 3660.36] And so, you know, it's frustrating to me whenever I see waste anywhere.
[3660.54 → 3666.12] And so if people don't label something, and they just leave it around, you know, I'll go, like...
[3666.12 → 3667.90] You know, I wish people would put their names on things.
[3668.24 → 3671.18] And it's like, yeah, for me, it's easy, because, like, my name's on all of them, I guess.
[3671.18 → 3678.08] Have you, like, sharpies your name onto something that has your name already on it?
[3678.10 → 3678.56] Yeah, of course.
[3679.34 → 3679.98] Yeah, I...
[3679.98 → 3681.76] I never even, like, thought about that.
[3681.92 → 3683.18] Yeah, yeah, I write on...
[3683.18 → 3686.88] I write LS on my merch items, because otherwise they get mixed up with other people's.
[3686.98 → 3687.72] That's pretty funny.
[3687.80 → 3689.48] It makes sense, but it's just pretty funny.
[3690.22 → 3691.24] I love the design.
[3691.40 → 3691.72] Thank you.
[3691.76 → 3692.40] I appreciate it.
[3692.46 → 3694.02] I don't fully remember the context.
[3694.42 → 3697.10] Someone said, yeah, nuke Mars, nuke the moon, nuke everything.
[3697.18 → 3698.14] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3698.22 → 3699.12] You were just, like...
[3699.12 → 3699.98] You were just, like...
[3699.98 → 3701.26] Why was I doing that?
[3701.34 → 3701.82] I don't remember.
[3701.82 → 3703.64] I remember it, but I don't remember why I did it.
[3703.66 → 3704.26] I don't remember.
[3704.34 → 3706.56] I don't feel like it really matters that much.
[3706.56 → 3709.06] It might have just, like, bothered you, so I just did it for fun.
[3709.12 → 3709.92] I don't know.
[3710.10 → 3713.74] All I know at this point is that it's a really cool design.
[3714.28 → 3714.54] Yeah.
[3714.68 → 3715.60] No, I love it.
[3715.64 → 3715.96] It's great.
[3716.06 → 3716.34] Anyway.
[3716.52 → 3719.32] I'm going to have to get, like, a bunch for my family and stuff.
[3719.56 → 3720.82] Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[3720.82 → 3722.92] I hope you have enough merch budget left over.
[3722.92 → 3724.60] Yeah, you'll make some sales off of me.
[3725.02 → 3725.04] Hey!
[3726.68 → 3728.90] Luke buying Luke Nuke shirts for all his friends and family.
[3729.98 → 3730.22] Oh!
[3731.10 → 3732.54] There's something else coming.
[3733.48 → 3734.38] Don't worry about it.
[3734.72 → 3734.90] What?
[3736.70 → 3737.56] What does that mean?
[3738.14 → 3739.20] Is it the budgie stickers?
[3739.24 → 3741.30] Look, what I said is obviously true.
[3742.50 → 3743.98] There is something else coming.
[3744.62 → 3746.38] I mean, it's factually accurate.
[3746.56 → 3748.42] Something somewhere is coming, I'm sure.
[3748.56 → 3752.04] Oh, apparently I wanted to nuke the moon as a way to terraform it or something.
[3752.04 → 3753.88] I think I was talking about Mars.
[3754.44 → 3754.74] Yeah.
[3755.12 → 3757.66] And I was talking about how Elon wanted to do that or something.
[3757.66 → 3758.36] I don't remember.
[3758.46 → 3758.96] It doesn't matter.
[3759.04 → 3759.46] Either way.
[3759.56 → 3759.74] Yeah.
[3760.08 → 3761.58] Someone will find it.
[3762.10 → 3763.66] Luke Nuke plush.
[3765.62 → 3766.02] Interesting.
[3766.22 → 3769.52] I wonder at what point we, like, get in trouble over infringement.
[3769.60 → 3771.12] I mean, it's obviously Luke.
[3771.66 → 3772.04] Yeah.
[3772.14 → 3772.30] Yeah.
[3772.60 → 3773.56] That's not...
[3773.56 → 3775.10] It doesn't look like Duke Nuke.
[3775.74 → 3776.98] I don't even know what you're talking about.
[3777.06 → 3777.56] I mean, neither.
[3777.72 → 3780.10] Any similarity to whatever it is...
[3780.10 → 3783.18] And if they made one, it would take them 11 years to release the shirt anyway.
[3783.18 → 3786.80] Okay, don't poke the bear.
[3792.00 → 3793.20] You killed him, dude.
[3793.72 → 3794.80] Oh my gosh.
[3796.16 → 3797.64] Absolutely murdered.
[3799.36 → 3801.22] Luke Sick Burns gone nuclear.
[3801.68 → 3804.62] Speaking of nuking things, I'm going to bring us back.
[3804.68 → 3805.02] I know.
[3805.14 → 3805.58] I'm sorry.
[3805.70 → 3807.32] It's the new version of AI topics.
[3807.46 → 3810.02] I'm going to bring us back to that Bethesda topic for a second.
[3810.02 → 3810.64] No, you're not.
[3810.72 → 3812.76] You're going to explain and do too many messages.
[3813.20 → 3814.30] Oh, okay.
[3814.34 → 3814.88] I'll save it.
[3814.92 → 3815.32] I'll save it.
[3815.34 → 3815.74] I'll save it.
[3816.16 → 3817.22] I'm going to lose the...
[3817.22 → 3817.64] Okay, fine.
[3817.68 → 3818.12] Just do it.
[3818.16 → 3818.86] Let's talk about it.
[3818.88 → 3820.18] We're going back to the Bethesda topic.
[3820.26 → 3820.68] Let's go.
[3820.80 → 3827.14] It has been brought to my attention by James Fine and with some help, Handyman and some other
[3827.14 → 3832.24] people in the float plane chat, that there are some interesting things in the Starfield Eula.
[3832.24 → 3839.02] One line, specifically, I'm going to do section 3. E.
[3840.30 → 3842.26] These are limitations and restrictions.
[3842.92 → 3848.46] Exploit the game or any of its parts, including with limitation the game client for any commercial
[3848.46 → 3854.66] purpose, including without limitation renting, leasing, or licensing the game to others, including
[3854.66 → 3862.40] without limitation, A, for gathering virtual currency, items or resources for sale outside
[3862.40 → 3867.34] the game, or for performing in-game services in exchange for payment outside the game.
[3867.98 → 3873.90] In that case, it says EG power levelling, which I think comes from their online services.
[3874.24 → 3879.82] There's some really weird sections of this Eula that people have pointed out to me before.
[3879.82 → 3881.58] So these things are all forbidden.
[3882.80 → 3884.82] Those things stated, which...
[3885.70 → 3887.24] Why is there pizza here?
[3889.74 → 3890.02] Oh.
[3890.70 → 3891.30] Okay.
[3893.90 → 3895.76] I don't know.
[3896.06 → 3897.82] The gathering of virtual currency...
[3898.64 → 3899.34] That's gold farming.
[3899.54 → 3900.30] Yeah, it's not...
[3900.30 → 3903.82] This sounds like part that they took from the Elder Scrolls Online.
[3904.18 → 3908.36] And I don't think actually pertains to this particular mod, in my opinion.
[3908.82 → 3909.24] Got it.
[3909.24 → 3915.82] But there are really, really weird sections, like this one, that is talking about...
[3915.82 → 3920.80] It specifically names power levelling, which is a thing that happens in, like, MMOs.
[3923.08 → 3928.46] There are other sections where it talks about how you can't use mods that would negatively impact
[3928.46 → 3929.62] other people's gameplay.
[3930.18 → 3931.24] And it's like...
[3931.88 → 3934.20] Yeah, that doesn't make any sense for a single-player game.
[3934.20 → 3940.28] So there's a ton of stuff in the Eula that talks about multiplayer-specific things.
[3940.38 → 3940.56] Right.
[3940.84 → 3941.08] Okay.
[3941.08 → 3947.44] So I wonder if there's, like, a DLC or something, or an expansion coming in the future that allows
[3947.44 → 3950.22] you to have companions on your ship that are your buddies.
[3950.76 → 3953.02] Because why else would they have these limitations in the Eula?
[3953.06 → 3954.24] Well, that's basically just Star Citizen.
[3954.24 → 3955.22] It pertains to Fallout 76.
[3955.22 → 3955.96] That functionality would...
[3955.96 → 3956.86] It's from Fallout 76.
[3957.14 → 3957.38] Okay.
[3957.52 → 3959.20] That functionality would take 10 years to build.
[3959.94 → 3960.34] Obviously.
[3961.08 → 3961.50] Yeah.
[3962.58 → 3963.34] That's generous.
[3965.60 → 3966.42] But yeah, okay.
[3966.50 → 3967.84] So they pulled it from Fallout 76.
[3968.00 → 3968.12] Sure.
[3968.22 → 3972.14] But either way, it came from a game that is not a single-player game.
[3972.14 → 3978.38] Gabriel R says, sorry to keep beating on this, but it seems like an important question.
[3978.84 → 3983.46] Do you think it makes a difference if we complain at the start of a trend, like with horse armour?
[3983.94 → 3989.26] It seems to me that companies will push it until they can, no matter what, and it will only
[3989.26 → 3992.92] stop happening after it becomes, so bad people grab their pitchforks and go for the throat.
[3993.48 → 3997.82] That's exactly the point, though, is if you grab the pitchforks and go for the throat,
[3997.82 → 4003.82] right at the beginning, when you see this behaviour that, on a small scale, might not
[4003.82 → 4009.14] be a big deal, but on a large scale, is going to completely change the face of gaming, then
[4009.14 → 4012.12] that will be the point where the pitchforks come out, and you go for the throat and they
[4012.12 → 4013.84] kind of go, ooh, maybe we shouldn't do this.
[4014.14 → 4018.16] Or maybe they just will do it anyway because that small percentage of people will continue
[4018.16 → 4018.64] to buy it.
[4019.16 → 4021.60] Okay, anyway, we never finished explaining merch messages.
[4021.94 → 4026.34] So the point is that we don't do super chats or Twitch bits or anything like that.
[4026.34 → 4031.14] We do merch messages, so you guys just go on ltdstore.com and in the cart, there will
[4031.14 → 4035.42] be a box when we're live for a merch message, and it'll get sent to producer Dan, who will
[4035.42 → 4039.44] either just pop it up there or maybe curate it for us to talk about or maybe give you a
[4039.44 → 4042.10] little reply with his burning dingies.
[4042.22 → 4043.10] Look at them go.
[4043.86 → 4045.10] They were doing something.
[4045.62 → 4050.72] And we're going to do a couple of them, just to kind of show you guys how that works.
[4050.82 → 4052.34] Dan, do you have a couple of curated ones for us?
[4052.56 → 4053.34] I do, I do.
[4053.84 → 4054.36] Let's see.
[4054.70 → 4055.72] I do saw a pretty cat.
[4055.72 → 4056.26] I do.
[4056.58 → 4061.50] Do you think traditional style forums will ever make a comeback or are hybrid social
[4061.50 → 4065.06] media forums like Reddit the best we will get in the mainstream?
[4065.38 → 4066.26] That ship sailed.
[4066.84 → 4071.52] Reddit, the Reddit community, and again, I'm speaking of it as though it's this monolithic
[4071.52 → 4077.20] thing, and it's not, but the Reddit community as a whole had their shot.
[4077.20 → 4082.98] And that was during the whole, you know, um, thing.
[4082.98 → 4090.72] And I think that what Reddit learned from all of that is that people are addicted to Reddit
[4090.72 → 4092.44] and will never stop using Reddit.
[4092.44 → 4094.70] And I learned the same thing.
[4095.44 → 4099.56] Uh, there, there was an opportunity for people to go, oh, this is bad.
[4099.56 → 4105.66] Having all this power consolidated in the hands of a company that clearly doesn't give a fuck.
[4105.66 → 4113.14] And I haven't seen any kind of meaningful shift to smaller community oriented forums.
[4113.44 → 4117.64] Uh, obviously we continue to maintain ours minimally.
[4117.90 → 4133.58] Uh, but because we do think it's important and, um, there are other small forum communities that do exist, but no, I, I don't think, I don't think anything beats Reddit anymore.
[4133.58 → 4160.68] I mean, during that whole debacle, I w I was saying, I think this could, this could be it, you know, dig came and went, but I just, uh, I feel like, I feel like the rate of, of change, you know, how we went from, you know, Manga to people just having like an MSN profile to face, like how quickly all this, uh, live journal, you know, like how quickly all my space, like how quickly everything used to change.
[4160.68 → 4166.88] Yeah. So there's a lot of, there's a lot of inertia in the incumbent players now.
[4166.88 → 4169.78] And it seems like Reddit has got it pretty much nailed down.
[4170.26 → 4170.66] Yeah.
[4170.86 → 4172.40] I'm not trying to be pessimistic.
[4172.48 → 4173.88] I just, yeah.
[4174.00 → 4174.16] Yeah.
[4174.16 → 4174.82] I ripped new grounds.
[4175.02 → 4175.18] Right.
[4177.84 → 4183.28] And for the second one, Hey Linus, what is the progress on the smaller LTT store backpack?
[4183.28 → 4183.76] Yeah.
[4183.82 → 4194.78] I'm glad you called it smaller and not small because we kind of realized that in trying to keep a lot of carrying capacity for laptops and tablets and devices, it's not that much smaller.
[4194.88 → 4195.64] Like it is smaller.
[4195.76 → 4198.12] Uh, it has an external water bottle carrier.
[4198.26 → 4203.28] So all of that like water bottle capacity is, is now, is now shrunk or well outside.
[4203.70 → 4205.74] Um, and it does have a smaller bag of holding.
[4205.74 → 4210.72] It is more comfortable on smaller, smaller framed people, but it's not small.
[4210.72 → 4216.90] I would say it's more like a, like a, like an LTT backpack light as opposed to a small LTT backpack.
[4217.54 → 4223.12] Um, I think we're getting pretty close to production for that.
[4223.60 → 4226.02] I think, Oh, I know what it is.
[4226.08 → 4228.10] The holdup is zipper pulls.
[4228.62 → 4228.92] Yeah.
[4228.92 → 4236.62] So we want to make sure that our production is done for the replacement zipper pulls for all the people who bought the original bag.
[4237.00 → 4242.62] Then we're going to production with the smaller bag as well as to production with the Lux bag.
[4243.56 → 4243.68] Yes.
[4243.68 → 4244.10] That makes sense.
[4244.36 → 4244.76] Priorities.
[4245.30 → 4247.26] I have another update.
[4247.58 → 4247.94] Sorry.
[4248.94 → 4251.88] Uh, I'm going to keep doing it, but I think this one's pretty big.
[4252.18 → 4258.72] Uh, James Ryan again, uh, sent me a link to the, uh, creation kit for Skyrim.
[4259.72 → 4263.92] And the like one of the very first sections, I'll share my screen.
[4264.18 → 4265.24] This is the top of it.
[4265.76 → 4268.50] The first actual section is restrictions on use.
[4269.86 → 4271.96] The editor is and shall remain.
[4272.04 → 4272.62] Oh, okay.
[4272.72 → 4272.88] Yeah.
[4272.90 → 4273.52] That's a good idea.
[4273.98 → 4275.24] Uh, I'm going to do that still.
[4275.60 → 4276.92] Maybe, maybe even more.
[4277.50 → 4277.94] Wow.
[4278.02 → 4278.38] Yeah.
[4278.56 → 4278.78] Wow.
[4278.88 → 4279.82] Now you don't even have to read it.
[4279.86 → 4280.56] They could just read it.
[4280.56 → 4280.90] Yeah.
[4281.38 → 4287.30] The editor is and shall remain the copyrighted property of Bethesda Soft works and or its design ease.
[4287.30 → 4293.54] And you shall take no action inconsistent with such title or ownership except as set forth in section five below.
[4293.54 → 4311.84] You may not cause or permit the sale or any other commercial distribution or commercial exploitation, uh, Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada, whether on a, uh, pay per play basis or otherwise of any new materials without the express prior written consent, uh, of an authorized representative of Bethesda Soft works.
[4311.84 → 4315.98] That's pretty clear.
[4316.12 → 4320.22] This DLSS thing was not made using creation kit.
[4320.30 → 4321.38] There is no creation kit.
[4321.72 → 4322.06] Right.
[4322.46 → 4323.82] For Starfield yet.
[4325.80 → 4328.88] So I don't think that applies to this situation.
[4329.02 → 4334.74] But it's very clear that Bethesda maintains the legal right to control anything that happens with creation kit.
[4334.90 → 4336.68] With creation kit specifically.
[4336.82 → 4336.94] Right.
[4336.94 → 4337.16] Yeah.
[4337.28 → 4337.52] Okay.
[4337.66 → 4337.84] Yeah.
[4337.94 → 4342.32] Which again, I think maybe I worded it poorly or something earlier, but people were like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[4342.36 → 4343.58] These things weren't made with creation kit.
[4343.66 → 4344.38] I understand that.
[4344.50 → 4345.14] It's not out yet.
[4345.36 → 4351.50] Every single, um, Starfield mod currently out was not made with creation kit because creation kit is not out.
[4352.22 → 4354.62] Um, and we don't even have a release date for creation kit.
[4354.72 → 4356.54] So like it might not even be soon.
[4356.94 → 4360.20] Tim in float plane chat asks, these are big, important questions here.
[4360.20 → 4364.74] I sent a merch message about this, but I noticed the Luke Newcomb shirt is a pre-order.
[4364.96 → 4367.44] I thought you said don't pre-order stuff anymore.
[4367.58 → 4369.24] Do I pre-order it or not?
[4370.22 → 4370.78] Okay.
[4373.28 → 4374.78] It's just a shirt.
[4375.08 → 4378.02] Our shirts are already a product that we already ship.
[4378.02 → 4383.82] And it's printed by our printer who does a great job and prints lots of products that we already ship.
[4384.04 → 4392.56] It's a pre-sale so that we don't overproduce it because even though I personally love it and have a high degree of confidence in the design.
[4393.04 → 4394.36] It's pretty specific.
[4394.54 → 4397.96] It's not enough to print 10,000 of them and just hope for the best.
[4398.14 → 4398.28] Yeah.
[4398.28 → 4403.10] So we just want to make exactly as many as you people want to buy.
[4403.60 → 4405.30] I think the design is great.
[4405.40 → 4407.06] I appreciate the work put into it.
[4407.12 → 4408.52] I don't know how many are going to move.
[4408.74 → 4410.46] What if you cheap out on this one though?
[4411.22 → 4412.58] I actually can't.
[4412.64 → 4415.82] They are actually just shirts that are actually just in our warehouse already.
[4416.00 → 4418.36] And we just take to the printer, and they print on them.
[4419.74 → 4420.14] Yeah.
[4420.86 → 4421.62] Oh man.
[4422.98 → 4423.38] Yeah.
[4423.38 → 4424.06] It's not a pre-order.
[4424.20 → 4424.82] It's a pre-sale.
[4424.92 → 4425.42] It's an auction.
[4425.42 → 4431.24] It's a anyway, do you want to hit us with one more, Dan?
[4432.44 → 4433.74] Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
[4434.46 → 4437.46] Hey, Dale L, celebrating my birthday, watching the WAN show.
[4437.92 → 4444.32] What is the absolute stupidest piece of tech that you've ever bought that you found you actually had a use for?
[4444.90 → 4445.54] Oh man.
[4445.58 → 4448.66] It's going to have to be like some weird adapter or something for me.
[4448.76 → 4449.10] Yeah.
[4450.38 → 4451.88] That I ever bought.
[4452.02 → 4453.08] Boy, is that a tough one.
[4453.08 → 4455.60] That I actually had use for?
[4456.14 → 4457.28] Is that...
[4457.28 → 4459.12] And what was it?
[4459.30 → 4460.28] Weird piece of tech?
[4460.34 → 4460.72] Was that it?
[4461.18 → 4464.40] I mean, it's not a weird piece of tech, but it's a stupid...
[4464.40 → 4464.60] Stupidest.
[4464.68 → 4466.96] It's not a stupid piece of tech, but it's a stupid implementation.
[4467.28 → 4469.74] I did end up using that TV I put in the bathtub.
[4471.74 → 4473.14] I think that's a fair answer.
[4473.26 → 4474.48] More than a little bit.
[4474.48 → 4476.48] It's like, who wouldn't...
[4476.48 → 4477.48] And not just me.
[4477.82 → 4480.94] Like, when my kids were little, right?
[4481.00 → 4483.06] So when the kids were having a bath, right?
[4483.12 → 4488.50] We just, we put on PAW Patrol in the bathtub, and then they'd have a bath and watch PAW Patrol or whatever.
[4488.78 → 4489.36] Like, yeah, cool.
[4489.54 → 4490.26] You're going to enjoy this.
[4490.26 → 4493.10] Anthraxes in Flow play Chat said, anything Silverstone?
[4496.36 → 4496.80] Yeah.
[4496.88 → 4500.82] I mean, I have a key fob that remotely starts my computer.
[4502.92 → 4503.32] Sure.
[4503.60 → 4504.02] Why not?
[4504.30 → 4504.76] Silverstone.
[4504.82 → 4506.24] Silverstone makes some weird stuff.
[4506.24 → 4508.76] Mine's going to be boring.
[4508.96 → 4511.40] I bought a 10 key.
[4511.90 → 4513.88] So it's, you know, you have 10 keyless keyboards.
[4514.04 → 4516.12] Well, it's the bit that most people chop off.
[4516.40 → 4521.44] I bought one of those in Taiwan that has blue switches made by Leopold.
[4523.66 → 4531.66] And I was like, you know, I understand the theory of you have your 10 keyless keyboard, and then you have your mousing area.
[4532.02 → 4534.88] I was going to say mouse pad, but a lot of your mouse pads will go under your keyboard.
[4534.88 → 4538.46] So just your mousing area, and then you have your 10 key on the other side.
[4538.54 → 4540.26] And that actually like works out really well.
[4540.50 → 4542.50] But like, I don't know if I'll ever actually use this.
[4542.62 → 4545.86] And I still use that same 10 key now.
[4545.94 → 4547.66] And that was like 10 years ago.
[4548.28 → 4553.38] Oh, I love my stupid little keyboard air mouse thing.
[4554.62 → 4555.06] Yeah.
[4555.86 → 4556.54] It's pretty good.
[4557.00 → 4558.30] Use it all the time.
[4558.42 → 4558.56] Yeah.
[4558.74 → 4564.12] Love it so much that when I realized it was discontinued, I bought two more just so that I would have more to use
[4564.12 → 4565.34] when it died.
[4565.60 → 4570.38] Like I, and it's, you know, it seems like a pretty superfluous thing.
[4570.54 → 4572.36] Like you can, I don't know, just grab a keyboard and mouse or whatever.
[4573.46 → 4576.04] Being able to just hold it, especially in VR.
[4576.34 → 4579.38] So I use it, I use it for my VR, my VR system.
[4579.38 → 4588.36] So I'll have my, like my headset on, and I'll be doing something that, I don't know, doesn't work in the virtual desktop.
[4588.36 → 4591.28] Like anytime you, oh, I think it's task manager.
[4591.50 → 4596.18] You can't interact with task manager from inside the virtual desktop for some reason.
[4596.30 → 4597.38] I think that's it.
[4597.42 → 4598.12] Or is it control, delete?
[4598.16 → 4598.42] I don't know.
[4598.46 → 4600.98] There's something that, there are some things you can't interact with.
[4600.98 → 4606.50] And so I'll grab my air mouse, and then I'll just be looking at the virtual screen, and I'll be able to use it.
[4607.70 → 4608.14] Yeah.
[4608.26 → 4610.54] And like with my controller, it's just hanging from my wrist.
[4610.66 → 4612.32] It's, it's awesome.
[4612.86 → 4613.28] Awesome.
[4615.36 → 4617.32] Do you think of another one?
[4617.32 → 4623.58] I thought of one, and then I laughed at something in chat, and then it's completely gone from my mind.
[4624.08 → 4625.80] I don't remember what it was at all.
[4626.54 → 4632.68] Was it someone's concern that they might pre-order the shirt, but it ships with only one sleeve, and they have to wait for drivers to get the other one?
[4633.40 → 4633.80] No.
[4635.02 → 4637.14] Just wait for dodders to charge for it.
[4637.44 → 4639.90] No, the green is not glow in the dark.
[4640.00 → 4645.18] Although it, like it does have some kind of fluorescent ink, but it is not glow in the dark.
[4645.18 → 4650.78] We've experimented with glow in the dark ink, and unfortunately we haven't found one that meets our quality standards.
[4650.98 → 4656.26] They tend to fade and not work very well after a pretty short period of time.
[4656.34 → 4659.60] So that's, that's why we haven't moved forward with a glow in the dark shirt.
[4659.82 → 4663.66] But yeah, I, I loved the idea when I, when I heard it, when we initially talked about it.
[4663.66 → 4669.04] There's also like colour change ones and stuff like that, but none of them have unfortunately held up.
[4669.46 → 4670.78] The staying power is rough.
[4670.78 → 4672.62] That's why we don't do the hollow foil ones anymore.
[4672.62 → 4677.42] I saw someone with a pristine GPU hollow foil shirt at LTX.
[4677.48 → 4682.00] They were like, yeah, I know that these are not very resilient, so I never wear it.
[4682.10 → 4684.62] I may not even wash it after wearing it this time.
[4684.76 → 4691.94] I just, I might just like sun it, you know, and get the smell out that way because I love how this thing looks.
[4691.96 → 4694.32] And I know that it won't look the same if I wash it a bunch.
[4694.66 → 4694.86] Yeah.
[4695.82 → 4696.96] And I can't remember what it was.
[4697.06 → 4698.00] I don't think I'm going to think of it.
[4698.04 → 4698.84] I think we should just move on.
[4699.86 → 4700.56] But yeah.
[4701.08 → 4701.44] Okay.
[4701.44 → 4704.30] So I think we need to do topics.
[4704.64 → 4704.84] Yeah.
[4704.98 → 4705.60] Let's do some topics.
[4705.84 → 4707.38] Should we do this Google one?
[4707.56 → 4708.20] I'm not going to lie.
[4708.26 → 4713.90] I don't even like fully understand what's happening here just because I don't fully know the controls on YouTube.
[4714.46 → 4714.86] Okay.
[4714.98 → 4723.50] This is almost two separate things that we've just kind of rolled into one discussion topic because it's basically like Google going all spur change.
[4723.50 → 4729.94] The original articles here from Ars Technica and Google support, actually.
[4729.94 → 4744.50] Google is rolling out its new privacy sandbox for the web, a user tracking ad platform that's baked into Chrome that uses the information collected through the browser to inform websites what topic the user is interested in for the purpose of targeted ads.
[4744.50 → 4749.02] The feature is apparently intended to one day replace third party cookies.
[4750.28 → 4750.72] Wow.
[4750.84 → 4755.32] Let's put more power in the Google monopoly.
[4755.54 → 4755.92] What do you think?
[4756.02 → 4756.70] Seem like a good idea?
[4756.80 → 4757.74] It seems like a good idea to me.
[4757.74 → 4758.02] It's sketchy.
[4758.96 → 4759.54] Slash S.
[4759.54 → 4761.22] I feel like I have to say that.
[4761.28 → 4762.24] It's probably not a good idea.
[4762.54 → 4762.98] Yeah, you know.
[4763.38 → 4777.84] Users will now see a pop-up asking them to turn on an ad privacy feature that will give them more choice over the ads they see while protecting their browser history and identity.
[4778.44 → 4785.54] While the pop-up does note that users can make changes in Chrome settings, it doesn't clarify that the feature can be opted out of.
[4785.54 → 4791.24] And clicking that the highlighted got it at the bottom of the page enables it by default.
[4792.32 → 4807.18] Other users have reported, speaking of dark patterns, other users have reported seeing a version that makes the option to opt out explicit, but it's unclear if this is in response to criticism of the initial pop-up or if it's a regional difference in areas that have more stringent legal standards.
[4807.34 → 4807.76] Got it?
[4808.10 → 4810.66] Like this first one is extremely dark patterned.
[4810.72 → 4811.04] Here.
[4811.14 → 4812.54] Well, here we can actually show it.
[4812.94 → 4813.86] This is what it looks like.
[4813.88 → 4814.38] This one's rough.
[4814.38 → 4816.16] Enhanced ad privacy in Chrome.
[4816.84 → 4818.62] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4819.10 → 4819.74] Got it.
[4819.98 → 4826.86] I guarantee you the vast majority of people are going to go like, oh, some weird update.
[4827.00 → 4827.94] Okay, got it.
[4828.92 → 4832.22] I want to go to my Facebook or whatever it is.
[4832.70 → 4832.92] Yep.
[4833.16 → 4833.38] Yeah.
[4833.78 → 4835.36] This is the other version, by the way.
[4836.20 → 4837.76] Which makes way more sense.
[4837.96 → 4838.16] Yep.
[4839.96 → 4840.28] Meanwhile.
[4841.28 → 4841.86] Oh, yeah.
[4841.86 → 4843.08] So, I don't know.
[4843.08 → 4844.70] There's not really much discussion here.
[4845.42 → 4846.04] That bad.
[4848.36 → 4863.64] Meanwhile, YouTube will be altering creators' ad controls in November by removing individual ad controls in YouTube Studio for pre-roll, post-roll, skippable, and non-skippable ads on new videos, and instead making them a single toggle.
[4864.12 → 4865.64] On or off.
[4866.92 → 4867.52] Interesting.
[4867.52 → 4869.86] According to YouTube.
[4869.86 → 4870.36] Oh, man.
[4870.36 → 4878.64] I love it when companies provide this rationale for changing the granularity of your options as a user.
[4879.20 → 4883.54] According to YouTube, 90% of creators already have these.
[4883.66 → 4886.48] Okay, this says off by default, but I suspect that is not right.
[4886.90 → 4888.86] I suspect they mean on by default.
[4888.98 → 4893.28] 90% of creators already have these set this way by default.
[4893.36 → 4894.40] That's what I'm assuming this says.
[4894.40 → 4897.30] And some found the options confusing.
[4897.56 → 4898.88] You have to love that some.
[4899.28 → 4902.08] Some creators didn't like the thumbs down feature.
[4902.94 → 4904.08] So we can remove it.
[4904.20 → 4905.48] We have basically infinite creators.
[4905.60 → 4908.44] So there will always be some group of people that think something.
[4908.94 → 4910.68] And therefore, we can do anything that we want.
[4910.68 → 4917.44] All it takes is 0.00001% of creators to find something confusing.
[4918.68 → 4921.70] And some creators will find it confusing.
[4923.26 → 4926.78] Mid-roll ads, however, will still be fully controlled by creators.
[4927.16 → 4927.76] For now.
[4927.96 → 4928.96] I added for now.
[4929.12 → 4935.12] But honestly, the way this slippery slope is sliding really does feel like a for now.
[4935.12 → 4940.26] Further, YouTube says creators will be able to choose to have automated mid-roll ad breaks
[4940.26 → 4942.26] or manually selected ones.
[4942.70 → 4946.02] Oh, and manually selected ones rather than choosing one or the other.
[4946.08 → 4947.56] Okay, so some context for you guys.
[4947.70 → 4953.84] The way that it works now, you choose to just let YouTube pick where to put mid-rolls
[4953.84 → 4961.26] based on where it doesn't disrupt user retention or, more likely, where it makes sense for the
[4961.26 → 4965.34] amount of time it's been since that individual user has seen a mid-roll.
[4965.80 → 4975.10] Because they try to ride the exact line between what you will tolerate, and what will make you
[4975.10 → 4976.68] exit the app, right?
[4976.68 → 4982.72] So if someone goes from a video where YouTube chose the mid-roll spots and there happened
[4982.72 → 4987.70] to be two in the latter half or something like that, and then they click on a video where
[4987.70 → 4992.46] the user picked the mid-roll spots, and they happen to have a couple front-loaded, they could
[4992.46 → 4994.12] end up accidentally overloading someone.
[4994.50 → 5000.80] But in spite of that potential issue, they are now giving better control over mid-rolls.
[5000.82 → 5003.04] So you can basically go, well, I definitely want one here.
[5003.60 → 5006.12] But also you can put them anywhere else you feel like.
[5006.68 → 5012.76] My understanding is most creators do use the automated mid-roll breaks as opposed to the
[5012.76 → 5013.82] manually selected ones.
[5014.12 → 5018.08] But I don't have any numbers to back that up.
[5018.08 → 5021.30] I'm sure there's some that have very important content pacing, which might want to frame it.
[5021.44 → 5021.66] Yeah.
[5021.80 → 5026.72] I think mostly, though, MrBeast uses automated ones the last time I heard about it.
[5026.82 → 5029.38] And so basically whatever he does is kind of the meta.
[5029.50 → 5030.36] What everyone's going to do.
[5030.42 → 5030.68] Yeah.
[5031.46 → 5036.66] Apparently, he's trying thumbnails where he doesn't have his mouth open or something.
[5036.68 → 5039.04] And he saw some positive results from that.
[5039.22 → 5044.16] So, hey, maybe that's new meta as well is no more YouTuber face.
[5045.22 → 5047.22] He's still got his lips open.
[5047.50 → 5051.74] But he's like, if you look back, like the last six videos or something like that, he's smiling
[5051.74 → 5054.10] like this in all of them instead of like that.
[5054.70 → 5055.14] Sure.
[5055.14 → 5060.18] It looks like almost like AI-generated face.
[5060.52 → 5061.62] If MrBeast...
[5061.62 → 5062.92] Here, can I switch over to your laptop?
[5063.08 → 5063.30] Yeah.
[5063.44 → 5067.84] If MrBeast jumped off a bridge, I really do think that a lot of other people would do it.
[5068.00 → 5068.94] Would just do it with him?
[5069.34 → 5069.62] Yeah.
[5069.90 → 5070.56] Oh, Geez.
[5070.84 → 5071.08] What's happening?
[5071.08 → 5071.72] Oh, Geez.
[5072.12 → 5072.94] Oh, Geez.
[5073.12 → 5073.56] The Zoom.
[5073.78 → 5074.84] The Zoom is not happy.
[5075.02 → 5075.38] Wow.
[5075.50 → 5076.16] We're going to end it.
[5076.30 → 5077.42] Do you even compute?
[5077.74 → 5079.82] Well, the touchscreen is...
[5079.82 → 5080.38] Luke, compute him.
[5080.38 → 5082.98] We won't be making that shirt anytime soon.
[5083.28 → 5083.30] No.
[5084.12 → 5086.62] But yeah, something about the thumbnails.
[5087.74 → 5089.16] His face looks very edited.
[5089.24 → 5090.02] This is great.
[5091.48 → 5095.92] If in 724 and float plane chat says spoke too soon, that is not better.
[5096.76 → 5100.24] So I didn't see their original comment, but I guess they were saying, oh, this will be
[5100.24 → 5101.02] a big improvement.
[5101.72 → 5102.08] Yeah.
[5105.28 → 5106.62] Okay, we're back to your laptop.
[5107.84 → 5108.78] I don't know.
[5108.78 → 5112.06] Can anyone's teeth actually be that white?
[5112.66 → 5114.02] That's kind of what I'm saying.
[5114.30 → 5118.20] It almost looks like a really, perfect Sims model.
[5118.32 → 5119.32] Can't deny that it works.
[5119.64 → 5121.32] Something is being edited there.
[5121.54 → 5125.98] Literally anywhere from 100 to 200 million views per video.
[5126.18 → 5128.18] I mean, who else can do that?
[5128.24 → 5130.96] If that smile could get me 100 million views, sure, I'll smile like that.
[5132.00 → 5132.90] I mean, I tried.
[5132.98 → 5134.16] I didn't do as good of a job.
[5134.22 → 5135.50] I'm not as young as him, unfortunately.
[5135.50 → 5137.88] And now we need to photo edit you.
[5137.88 → 5139.60] Looks AI generated?
[5139.70 → 5139.86] Yeah.
[5139.96 → 5140.86] Like almost does.
[5140.98 → 5142.90] It has, I don't know what it is.
[5144.42 → 5146.42] And like, I've obviously seen him.
[5146.72 → 5149.00] So like, I'm not saying he looks like that.
[5149.14 → 5149.94] I'm just like these.
[5150.12 → 5151.86] No, he looks like a pretty, pretty normal dude.
[5152.04 → 5152.22] Yeah.
[5152.26 → 5154.44] And then these, they just, something's different.
[5154.56 → 5155.26] I don't know what it is.
[5155.26 → 5157.46] Uh, Cargo asks, any rain cover updates?
[5157.52 → 5157.62] Yeah.
[5157.64 → 5162.22] I had someone ask that on the forum and I said, look, I'm sorry, we're not done yet, but we
[5162.22 → 5162.86] sent them a prototype.
[5163.72 → 5164.06] Rain cover?
[5164.36 → 5164.56] Yeah.
[5164.62 → 5165.36] Rain cover for the backpack.
[5165.66 → 5166.22] Oh yeah.
[5166.34 → 5166.48] Yeah.
[5166.60 → 5168.46] Oh, I saw the design for it though.
[5168.46 → 5169.98] Okay.
[5170.12 → 5176.78] You know how reflective stuff can, uh, can be like silver, or it can be like kind of rainbow?
[5177.92 → 5178.28] Okay.
[5178.44 → 5179.06] Why not both?
[5179.58 → 5182.22] So we're going to have, it's kind of inspired by the Northern Lights desk pad.
[5182.22 → 5182.92] Like two different options?
[5182.92 → 5183.50] Or?
[5183.96 → 5184.36] No, no.
[5184.42 → 5186.04] Like both on the same design.
[5186.18 → 5190.70] So it's kind of inspired by the Northern Lights desk pad, and it's going to be like, like trees
[5190.70 → 5193.08] in the foreground, and they're going to be like the rainbow one.
[5193.12 → 5193.94] Oh, this is sick.
[5193.94 → 5196.86] And then like mountains and then like kind of constellations in the sky, and it'll be on
[5196.86 → 5197.56] the back of your backpack.
[5197.84 → 5201.98] I'm not exactly a rain cover connoisseur, but all the ones that I see are just black.
[5202.94 → 5204.38] That's cool that it has a graphic on it.
[5204.38 → 5204.68] Yeah.
[5204.78 → 5205.44] And it's reflective.
[5205.70 → 5210.06] So the idea is that it'll be safer at night because it's something we, um, didn't think
[5210.06 → 5212.50] of when we did the original design for the backpack.
[5212.50 → 5215.62] And so, Hey, at least if you're going to be out riding with it.
[5216.04 → 5218.96] Um, well, Hey, maybe you'll put a rain cover on and then at least we'll have something
[5218.96 → 5219.78] reflective for it.
[5219.90 → 5220.02] Yeah.
[5220.06 → 5220.24] Cool.
[5221.00 → 5223.00] Um, I have no idea how much it'll cost.
[5224.72 → 5225.12] Yeah.
[5225.26 → 5225.90] I don't know.
[5225.98 → 5227.34] It'll cost however much it costs.
[5227.40 → 5233.30] I mean, realistically, most of our products are just cost times some percentage that kind
[5233.30 → 5233.92] of makes sense.
[5234.32 → 5238.10] Um, like it's not, but we're not really, yeah, we're not really like that.
[5238.16 → 5241.98] We have some that we make like an outsized margin percentage on, but generally speaking,
[5241.98 → 5246.92] that's just the like the lower cost items where a big part of the cost is not the cogs,
[5247.02 → 5247.74] the cost of goods sold.
[5247.82 → 5249.12] It's like the handling costs.
[5249.60 → 5254.40] Um, and just the, the, the, the overhead involved in performing a transaction.
[5254.40 → 5260.24] Like if we had something that cost 30 cents, and we marked it up, um, a hundred points,
[5260.24 → 5264.90] I can't, I can't sell something for 60 cents because I can't even cover what it costs for
[5264.90 → 5268.26] someone to put it in a warehouse and then go get it from a warehouse and then put it
[5268.26 → 5269.64] in a box, and they send it to you.
[5269.64 → 5270.82] Like, it just doesn't make any sense.
[5270.82 → 5275.78] Whereas for something that costs $10, yeah, we might charge 20 bucks for it, uh, because
[5275.78 → 5278.00] we can, we can absorb those costs much more easily.
[5278.00 → 5281.88] So it's, it, it varies a little bit depending on the actual like base cost of the item.
[5282.02 → 5283.36] But, um, yeah.
[5283.56 → 5288.78] I think some people are going to misunderstand that because you didn't specify cogs every
[5288.78 → 5290.70] time it was just cogs, and you said costs.
[5291.00 → 5291.98] Oh, cost is cogs.
[5292.64 → 5293.04] Yeah.
[5293.10 → 5293.94] Cogs is cost.
[5293.94 → 5298.24] So when he's talking about costs, he just means of the, the components that go into the
[5298.24 → 5298.50] thing.
[5298.58 → 5298.84] Yeah.
[5298.84 → 5300.02] But then it has to be shipped.
[5300.24 → 5304.08] The, the people that put it in the box, there's a there's a handling fee every single time
[5304.08 → 5306.64] they do that for every single individual item.
[5306.72 → 5309.96] Like that, that's a fee that is charged to us by a third party company.
[5309.96 → 5312.56] It's not just like a number I'd pulled out of my butt.
[5312.58 → 5313.62] Like it's a real fee.
[5313.74 → 5317.04] And then there's, there are other things the whole way along, et cetera, et cetera.
[5317.30 → 5318.00] But yeah.
[5318.66 → 5319.34] All right.
[5320.30 → 5321.40] Oh, sponsors.
[5321.70 → 5326.26] Hey, the show was brought to you today by Ridge Hennessy.
[5326.26 → 5329.72] Are you obsessed with being inefficient in every way possible?
[5330.50 → 5330.94] No.
[5331.44 → 5331.66] Okay.
[5331.72 → 5335.44] And then why are you walking around with that behemoth of a bifold wallet in your pocket?
[5336.16 → 5341.32] Get rid of your, get rid of your bulky wallet and meet the Ridge.
[5341.32 → 5345.32] They redefine the traditional wallet with compact and stylish designs.
[5345.68 → 5349.84] Ridge wallets can hold up to 12 cards plus room for cash with either a money clip or an
[5349.84 → 5350.48] elastic band.
[5350.64 → 5353.12] They have over 30 colour and style variations.
[5353.12 → 5354.72] So there's something for every taste.
[5354.72 → 5361.40] And the Ridge and Hennessy performance are teaming up again for Ridge's third annual summer sweepstakes.
[5361.40 → 5367.76] You can win some amazing prizes like a Hennessy Ford Bronco or $75,000 in cash.
[5368.16 → 5373.12] No purchase is necessary, but you do get a bonus entry for every dollar spent, or you can get
[5373.12 → 5377.86] up to a thousand bonus entries for every dollar spent on custom Hennessy products.
[5377.86 → 5382.64] Just head over to the website to secure yourself some sleek wallets and fancy key cases.
[5382.88 → 5387.30] And who knows, maybe you end up in a Hennessy Ford Bronco Velociraptor in the process.

[5395.56 → 5397.36] The show is also brought to you by Secret Lab.
[5397.88 → 5400.56] I have been in the hot seat for a while.
[5401.24 → 5402.46] Dennis wrote this, I can tell.
[5402.46 → 5407.90] And trust me, there are better seats to be in, like our sponsor, Secret Labs Gaming Chairs.
[5408.72 → 5413.56] Secret Labs Titan Eve Series Gaming Chair, which we are sitting on right now, by the way,
[5413.92 → 5418.80] offers four-way lumbar support, a magnetic memory foam head pillow, and is offered in
[5418.80 → 5422.96] different upholsteries like hybrid leatherette, soft weave fabric, and Napa leather.

[5444.02 → 5447.44] Just head to the link in the description to check out Secret Lab today.
[5448.32 → 5450.36] Finally, the show is brought to you by Red Magic.
[5451.20 → 5454.10] Have you ever been bored at work and just wanted to game on your phone?
[5454.52 → 5457.94] Okay, well, as an employer, I would ask you maybe not to do that.
[5457.94 → 5463.76] As a professional slacker at work, Dennis recommends the Red Magic 8S Pro.
[5464.56 → 5465.04] Wow.
[5465.40 → 5470.22] Red Magic has positioned themselves as a leader in the mobile gaming space with blisteringly
[5470.22 → 5473.88] fast, gamer-centric phones like their latest Red Magic 8S Pro.
[5474.50 → 5480.08] Featuring a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, a 120Hz refresh rate display, a 6.8-inch
[5480.08 → 5483.10] AMOLED screen, and a 6,000 mAh battery.
[5483.10 → 5488.52] According to Red Magic Labs, during a two-hour game, the frame rate remains stable at 59.9
[5488.52 → 5492.42] FPS and, wow, 49.7-degree maximum temps.
[5492.96 → 5497.60] Plus, with the 8S Pro, you get some unique features like the upgraded ICE 12.0 cooling
[5497.60 → 5501.90] system and a pair of 520 Hz pulling rate shoulder triggers.
[5501.90 → 5508.04] Check out the Red Magic 8S Pro at the link below and become a pro gamer at work with Dennis.
[5509.16 → 5510.26] What even is that?
[5510.32 → 5511.36] What am I even looking at?
[5511.40 → 5511.80] What is that hat?
[5511.80 → 5512.42] He's laughing.
[5512.66 → 5513.32] He's laughing.
[5513.34 → 5514.06] He's laughing.
[5514.32 → 5516.14] I think that's why the head's shaking, is he's laughing.
[5517.30 → 5518.10] Okay, sure.
[5518.24 → 5518.62] Why not?
[5518.92 → 5519.56] Ha ha ha ha.
[5520.52 → 5521.78] I play video games.
[5522.74 → 5524.18] Anywho, what do you want to talk?
[5524.18 → 5525.60] Oh, we're supposed to do three merch messages.
[5525.72 → 5526.32] Okay, thanks, Dan.
[5526.88 → 5527.16] Welcome.
[5527.42 → 5527.78] Hit us.
[5528.14 → 5528.50] Sure.
[5528.50 → 5533.84] Cleo Abrams predicts tech advancements if sustainable, high-scale energy production,
[5534.04 → 5536.08] like nuclear power, is widespread.
[5536.58 → 5540.64] What do you think will be the biggest change to our lives with unlimited power?
[5542.84 → 5545.86] I won't feel bad for leaving my computer on all the time?
[5546.96 → 5547.52] I don't know.
[5547.62 → 5554.30] I mean, I have to say, I'm sorry, people who live in places where power is very expensive
[5554.30 → 5556.22] or environmentally impactful.
[5556.78 → 5558.10] Here in BC...
[5558.10 → 5559.12] Wait, you don't even sleep it?
[5560.36 → 5560.72] No.
[5561.10 → 5561.46] Why?
[5561.70 → 5562.82] Well, how will I remote into it?
[5563.76 → 5564.90] You can wake it.
[5565.78 → 5567.18] Yeah, but it's not reliable.
[5567.76 → 5568.64] That's probably true.
[5569.16 → 5570.34] Like, I don't know, man.
[5570.76 → 5571.96] Yeah, sorry.
[5572.06 → 5573.22] Sleep isn't reliable in general.
[5573.44 → 5574.92] My computer just doesn't sleep now.
[5575.08 → 5575.22] Yeah.
[5575.22 → 5576.64] I might as well call it restart.
[5576.64 → 5578.76] We talked about this in the recent thing.
[5578.88 → 5579.00] Yeah.
[5579.00 → 5581.28] So you'll hear us talk about that soon.
[5581.40 → 5584.06] But yeah, my computer just...
[5584.06 → 5585.58] It's like a delayed restart.
[5585.88 → 5586.18] Yeah.
[5586.26 → 5588.44] If I set it to sleep, it'll restart in two or three hours.
[5588.58 → 5589.58] I don't know what to tell you.
[5589.58 → 5590.40] Like, I...
[5590.40 → 5595.76] So we live in British Columbia, Canada, where all of our power comes from falling water.
[5596.04 → 5601.62] And you can talk about the environmental impact of hydroelectric power all you want.
[5601.62 → 5604.80] But the reality of it is, those dams are already there.
[5606.36 → 5609.30] The power that they generate is just there.
[5609.46 → 5611.82] And you can either use it or you can lose it.
[5612.36 → 5614.82] And so it's cheap.
[5615.16 → 5615.94] It's cheap.
[5616.12 → 5616.78] It's plentiful.
[5617.28 → 5623.12] We don't, I think, for the most part, really think about power consumption that much.
[5623.30 → 5623.90] Honestly, not a ton.
[5624.00 → 5624.60] A little bit.
[5624.64 → 5628.80] Now, there are energy costs here that are higher than other parts of the world.
[5628.80 → 5632.80] Like, whenever I hear Americans complaining about their gas prices, I kind of go...
[5633.66 → 5636.80] Hey, by the way, ours only look low because they're in litres.
[5637.48 → 5640.38] Yeah, which is one-fourth of a gallon, okay?
[5641.44 → 5645.38] We pay a lot for fuel, which is one of the reasons.
[5645.56 → 5647.10] I learned this recently, actually.
[5647.22 → 5652.60] Apparently, Vancouver is the Tesla ownership capital of, if not the world, North America.
[5653.12 → 5655.58] And I would have thought, well, California, right?
[5655.66 → 5658.36] Trendy, blah, blah, blah, you know, conscious or whatever.
[5658.36 → 5661.02] Yeah, but electricity is really expensive in California.
[5661.54 → 5664.64] Electricity costs frickin' nothing here.
[5665.22 → 5672.60] So I guess what I'm trying to say is that for me, personally, it wouldn't change anything
[5672.60 → 5677.46] because power literally runs out of the taps like water.
[5677.46 → 5689.34] But in terms of, like, globally, you know, I would expect to see more widespread use, for example, of things like climate control.
[5689.52 → 5692.04] Like, I would expect that to become more affordable for people.
[5692.04 → 5699.08] I would expect even more of a push towards the data centre.
[5699.70 → 5702.56] Like, one of the biggest costs of running a data centre is power.
[5703.10 → 5706.22] So I would expect to see even more investments in data centres.
[5706.34 → 5709.74] I would expect to see more experiences that are data centre focused.
[5709.74 → 5714.14] I mean, I've been talking about how I think the data centre could change gaming for a long time.
[5714.64 → 5722.32] Like, just massively, much more massively multiplayer worlds could be achieved by having everything clustered in one place
[5722.32 → 5724.96] and everybody else removing into it and just getting their video feeds.
[5725.20 → 5727.02] Here's a weird negative take.
[5727.30 → 5727.72] Yeah, sure.
[5727.80 → 5729.64] I think light pollution would get really bad.
[5730.42 → 5731.36] Oh, people just what?
[5731.42 → 5732.60] Just like, don't bother turning off.
[5732.60 → 5734.62] Even on, LEDs last for frickin' forever.
[5735.16 → 5735.78] Sort of.
[5735.78 → 5736.94] So there's a whole thing.
[5737.68 → 5742.14] I think, man, okay, I'm going to get a lot wrong because this is a rabbit hole I went down a while ago.
[5742.24 → 5747.58] But what I, my understanding is that that was a big part of the sales pitch for LEDs.
[5747.82 → 5749.38] And I don't mean LEDs in general.
[5749.48 → 5750.80] What you said is not false.
[5751.30 → 5754.78] But LED light bulbs, like that screw into a socket.
[5755.72 → 5760.16] What I've heard is that much like traditional light bulbs,
[5760.72 → 5763.54] while the technology is inherently more reliable,
[5763.54 → 5766.70] it's kind of been engineered to not be that reliable.
[5767.26 → 5769.44] Yeah, because like super, super OG light bulbs,
[5770.22 → 5771.56] like filament light bulbs,
[5772.06 → 5774.78] would also just last for incredible amounts of time.
[5775.10 → 5776.70] And then they were engineered to be worse.
[5777.02 → 5777.18] Yeah.
[5777.34 → 5777.52] Yeah.
[5778.04 → 5785.40] So, yeah, my understanding is LEDs are not designed properly to last.
[5785.62 → 5788.28] But in theory, yeah, what you're saying is correct.
[5788.50 → 5790.90] You could have bulbs that are just, I don't know, just like on all the time.
[5790.96 → 5791.16] Who cares?
[5791.16 → 5792.94] But then like people want to sleep, right?
[5794.48 → 5795.72] Then again, you see a lot of...
[5795.72 → 5799.50] Well, and you want to be able to see the stars and like go hiking and not be like,
[5799.58 → 5801.26] wow, it's glowing.
[5801.72 → 5803.56] Well, no, I just meant people are going to want to sleep.
[5803.66 → 5805.08] So they might turn off the lights in their house.
[5805.16 → 5810.06] But then it occurred to me that a lot of modern architecture has a lot of lighting on the outside of buildings.
[5810.06 → 5814.62] Like every new house listing you look at is like...
[5814.62 → 5821.00] This is supposed to be a farm, but they found some loophole to make it so they can just build their giant mansion on it and not farm at all.
[5821.22 → 5827.88] All those that have like 10 million lights all along the roofing are in the entire perimeter of the house.
[5828.04 → 5828.90] It's like, oh my God.
[5829.00 → 5829.24] Okay.
[5829.62 → 5831.76] It's not like a spaceship taking off.
[5831.80 → 5832.28] It's a house.
[5832.36 → 5833.06] You can relax.
[5833.70 → 5834.14] I don't know.
[5834.14 → 5834.74] Okay.
[5835.44 → 5835.92] Up next.
[5836.36 → 5843.80] Would you go back to living without technology if drivers became a monthly subscription without a buy it for life option?
[5844.66 → 5845.22] Would you...
[5845.22 → 5846.96] This is a weird question.
[5847.20 → 5847.30] So basically...
[5847.30 → 5848.92] Would you go back to living without technology?
[5849.30 → 5850.36] Oh, I see.
[5850.36 → 5850.54] Yeah.
[5850.58 → 5855.72] If your computer just stops working if you don't pay for it.
[5856.12 → 5856.98] You want to use USB?
[5857.98 → 5858.42] Subscription.
[5858.60 → 5858.74] Yeah.
[5858.84 → 5860.30] No, I would probably pay.
[5860.46 → 5861.24] Like what am I...
[5861.24 → 5862.10] Ultimately, yeah.
[5862.62 → 5863.00] Yeah.
[5863.00 → 5866.70] Some people are going to pay, and then those people are just going to have such a significant leg up.
[5866.94 → 5867.08] Yeah.
[5867.18 → 5872.04] And the thing too is that like you got to remember for me, technology is not just recreational, right?
[5872.08 → 5873.18] Like that's how I make my living.
[5873.40 → 5873.74] Your job.
[5873.84 → 5874.16] Me too.
[5874.76 → 5878.52] And so it's kind of like the way that I complain about...
[5878.52 → 5878.66] Yeah.
[5878.66 → 5878.74] Yeah.
[5878.84 → 5879.62] Trent and Flow play Chat.
[5879.68 → 5880.68] I would pirate the drivers.
[5881.74 → 5882.44] Let's go.
[5883.06 → 5883.38] Yeah.
[5883.74 → 5884.18] I mean...
[5884.18 → 5884.42] Let's go.
[5886.16 → 5891.66] Unless the inconvenience of pirating the drivers and the reliability of pirating the drivers...
[5891.66 → 5892.68] Linux would take off.
[5892.68 → 5895.10] So much worse than...
[5895.10 → 5897.72] Remember too, Linux is not the problem here though.
[5897.84 → 5899.76] Like we're not talking about Microsoft here.
[5899.94 → 5901.72] We're talking about hardware manufacturers.
[5901.72 → 5903.30] We're talking about hardware drivers.
[5903.42 → 5905.02] So that's not even the solution, unfortunately.
[5905.02 → 5906.64] Linux has a lot of generic drivers for things.
[5906.96 → 5907.50] That's true.
[5907.64 → 5910.68] But if all of a sudden hardware manufacturers started charging...
[5911.82 → 5912.04] What?
[5912.14 → 5912.40] I don't know.
[5912.40 → 5913.06] Linux Foundation?
[5913.22 → 5913.48] Someone.
[5913.72 → 5914.86] They find some way.
[5914.86 → 5915.20] Yeah.
[5915.28 → 5917.12] If they find some way to DRM it then...
[5917.12 → 5919.80] Like remember guys, this is a hypothetical scenario.
[5919.96 → 5920.78] It's a condition scenario.
[5920.78 → 5924.20] So we also assume that piracy or Linux doesn't solve it.
[5924.32 → 5924.46] Yeah.
[5924.58 → 5928.44] We're trying to in good faith answer the actual question.
[5928.44 → 5931.00] And the answer is yeah, just like Adobe.
[5932.76 → 5934.22] I'd complain about it.
[5934.48 → 5935.40] I'd be upset.
[5935.52 → 5937.90] But people keep using Premiere and Photoshop and everything else.
[5937.90 → 5939.42] But I'd keep buying it.
[5940.86 → 5943.86] The second it touches work things...
[5944.86 → 5945.64] Stuff gets interesting.
[5945.80 → 5946.64] Yeah, because...
[5946.64 → 5947.48] For your mouse.
[5947.80 → 5950.76] I do think that could be the thing.
[5950.78 → 5953.92] If that happened, which I don't actually think it's going to.
[5954.12 → 5960.60] But if that happened, I think that would be the thing that would finally usher in the year of the Linux desktop.
[5961.16 → 5962.42] The year of the Linux desktop.
[5963.38 → 5965.94] Can you meme slightly harder?
[5966.64 → 5968.08] I mean you're already wearing that shirt.
[5968.48 → 5971.52] And you're going to year of the Linux desktop meme on me.
[5971.70 → 5972.80] I actually really like it.
[5972.90 → 5973.20] I know.
[5973.26 → 5973.62] It's awesome.
[5973.76 → 5974.44] It's pretty great.
[5974.82 → 5975.40] You know what?
[5975.40 → 5978.30] I'm not going to say which of the designers who worked on it.
[5978.36 → 5979.78] Because I don't want to single anybody out.
[5979.82 → 5985.42] But somebody expressed to me that they weren't that confident in their work on it.
[5986.00 → 5986.42] I don't know.
[5986.52 → 5987.82] I think the design is great.
[5987.96 → 5989.92] I was basically like...
[5989.92 → 5990.76] Nah, man.
[5991.86 → 5992.54] You are good.
[5992.94 → 5994.30] I don't know how well it's going to sell.
[5994.30 → 5997.58] But I don't think that's because the design isn't...
[5997.58 → 5998.30] I just...
[5998.30 → 5998.84] I don't know.
[5999.68 → 6000.18] I mean...
[6000.18 → 6001.44] I can find out for you.
[6002.10 → 6003.14] It doesn't take that long.
[6003.14 → 6004.36] It's just...
[6004.36 → 6006.26] It's in reference to such a niche thing.
[6008.36 → 6008.72] Okay.
[6009.64 → 6011.02] Some people are buying them.
[6011.84 → 6013.02] I don't make the rules, man.
[6013.08 → 6013.28] Yeah.
[6013.50 → 6013.88] I don't know.
[6013.92 → 6014.48] I think it looks cool.
[6014.68 → 6014.82] Yeah.
[6015.36 → 6015.72] Anyway.
[6016.14 → 6016.68] Okay, Dan.
[6016.72 → 6017.20] Hit us again.
[6017.56 → 6017.90] Sure thing.
[6017.90 → 6019.00] Hi.
[6019.12 → 6022.80] I always wanted to know how you decide what tier of car to review.
[6023.14 → 6029.96] For example, the difference between a Platinum F-150 Lightning and Standard is almost twice the price and different specs.
[6030.52 → 6030.98] You know what?
[6031.06 → 6033.84] We run into the same challenge with just about everything.
[6035.22 → 6037.66] Laptops are another perfect example of this.
[6037.66 → 6050.28] You can configure the same laptop and have completely different characteristics for the final machine in terms of everything from performance to battery life and, of course, to price.
[6050.42 → 6052.06] I mean, look at a MacBook.
[6052.06 → 6058.10] It can be configured anywhere from, you know, a couple grand to six grand, depending on what kind of storage options you put in them.
[6058.10 → 6071.18] And, unlike a MacBook, a PC laptop can have a much bigger difference in terms of performance at all of those different price tiers because the configuration options are so much more granular.
[6071.40 → 6077.22] I mean, on a MacBook, a lot of that price at the top tier option is going to be because you, like, stuffed it full of SSDs.
[6077.24 → 6081.34] That's not something that impacts the average user's daily experience.
[6081.44 → 6083.86] It's just how much of a digital pack rat you can be, right?
[6083.88 → 6084.86] It doesn't matter that much.
[6084.86 → 6087.94] But on a lot of machines, yeah, it's extremely challenging.
[6088.16 → 6090.24] Even stuff like kingpin cards back in the day?
[6090.34 → 6090.64] Yeah.
[6090.88 → 6091.48] Stuff like that.
[6091.56 → 6093.48] It's like, oh, is this even the same thing, really?
[6093.50 → 6094.62] Is this a 980?
[6094.70 → 6095.14] I don't know.
[6095.24 → 6095.46] Yeah.
[6095.62 → 6095.78] Yeah.
[6095.84 → 6101.64] Who even draws the line at, you know, what is one thing versus what is a completely different thing?
[6102.32 → 6112.58] So, you know, when it comes to things like cars, a lot of the time, realistically, we're kind of at the mercy of what the manufacturer has in their demo, in their press car stable.
[6112.58 → 6127.62] And so for something like the Taycan, so that was a car that, no, that was, was that the first, like, car review that, no, the first one was the Volt.
[6127.78 → 6129.62] And that was just because that was the one I bought.
[6129.62 → 6134.88] And the reason I bought that particular trim level was because I bought it secondhand and that was the one that was a good deal.
[6135.48 → 6143.08] And then with the Taycan, that blue one was the one that was in the Porsche, like, press carpool.
[6143.08 → 6157.28] And then what's funny is I actually ended up having the kind of problem that I guess you're sort of trying to highlight here because I went, and I purchased a Taycan based on my experiences with it.
[6157.32 → 6160.78] I didn't, like, bother to test drive exactly the model that I was buying.
[6160.86 → 6164.38] And I didn't realize, just didn't really think about it.
[6164.42 → 6166.44] I was like, oh, yeah, it's like a Taycan, but, like, better.
[6166.58 → 6168.14] It's one of the higher tier ones.
[6168.14 → 6174.28] I didn't realize it weighs, like, another 600 pounds or something because it's got more motors in it.
[6175.16 → 6189.10] And I, like, obviously, if I thought about it for 20 seconds, I probably would have thought, oh, yeah, you know, maybe they didn't have anywhere else that they could shed more weight to put these extra motors in.
[6189.16 → 6195.30] But then, you know, maybe I would have assumed, oh, I don't know, maybe it has more carbon fibre in it or whatever, and they balance it out that way.
[6195.34 → 6196.66] But, no, it's just heavier.
[6196.66 → 6204.00] And so what I realized is that while it's really quick off the line, and it really is, around corners, it's a bit floatier.
[6204.88 → 6210.74] And sometimes I actually, like, miss the regular, like, I think it was a 4S or the baseball.
[6210.80 → 6216.70] I can't remember which exact one it was that I did the review on, but I actually missed that one because it wasn't a light car by any stretch.
[6216.70 → 6222.44] I mean, no electric car is going to be agile the way that an ICE car might be.
[6222.60 → 6228.82] But sometimes I miss the at least somewhat agiler agility of that lighter car.
[6228.98 → 6231.54] So, no, yeah, it's a huge problem.
[6231.64 → 6233.74] Same with the GR Corolla.
[6233.92 → 6235.92] Like, it was what Toyota had.
[6235.92 → 6239.44] Now, a lot of the time those press cars are the one that sells.
[6239.90 → 6240.00] Yeah.
[6240.46 → 6241.58] And that's for two reasons.
[6241.74 → 6248.16] One is that's what they want reviewers looking at because, realistically, like, they've done all the market research.
[6248.34 → 6249.16] They've done all the development.
[6249.30 → 6251.64] They know what configuration of the car is a good one.
[6251.70 → 6253.40] They know which one they're going to make a bunch of.
[6253.40 → 6259.48] So, that's what they want people looking at so that it's representative, except when they don't, right?
[6259.92 → 6267.84] And then number two is a lot of the time those press cars, I mean, they don't get shredded unless they go to Mr. Beast, I guess.
[6268.38 → 6269.56] He's shredded a Lamborghini.
[6269.74 → 6270.26] It doesn't matter.
[6270.40 → 6272.74] The point is, like, they don't just get crushed, right?
[6272.80 → 6274.48] So, someone's going to buy it at some point.
[6274.74 → 6278.78] So, it might as well be something that is easy to get rid of, something liquid.
[6278.78 → 6283.82] But, as I alluded to before, that's not necessarily always the case.
[6283.92 → 6288.06] Sometimes they might equip something with really nice options.
[6288.56 → 6297.68] You know, in particular, you could see this on things like sound systems that might not change the handling of the car at all, but do change the experience and comfort.
[6297.68 → 6311.82] And because a car is so emotional, it is such an emotional product compared to something like a graphics card, which you can objectively measure the goodness of in every way.
[6311.90 → 6314.52] A car is just so subjective.
[6315.26 → 6318.68] And so, you know, I could see that as a way that they could try to...
[6319.26 → 6321.88] There's a ton of reasons why I really like my car.
[6321.88 → 6327.96] And if you took it away and gave me an almost identical car, even, like, same model and everything, I would not like it as much.
[6327.96 → 6333.86] And so, that can introduce a lot of subjective bias or a lot of, like, subconscious bias is what I meant to say.
[6334.22 → 6343.58] If, you know, they make sure all the press cars have the like, $700, you know, nicer seat option or something like that, even though they know most people aren't going to spring for it.
[6344.42 → 6344.78] Yeah.
[6345.08 → 6345.48] Yeah.
[6346.44 → 6347.10] It's tough.
[6347.10 → 6354.30] I think the answer is when we have a choice, what we try to go for is the one that makes sense.
[6354.40 → 6363.24] And this is actually part of what inspired that video that we did on how starting at is the biggest lie in tech.
[6363.24 → 6378.48] Because the starting at configuration of a computer is almost always a crappy configuration that is intentionally one that is kneecapped in some way so that people will buy the next one.
[6379.02 → 6379.12] Right?
[6379.16 → 6381.48] Like, it's never the one they actually want you to buy.
[6381.88 → 6381.96] Yeah.
[6381.96 → 6391.76] And it was a conversation that we were having around how challenging it is to talk about pricing for laptops.
[6391.76 → 6396.44] Because on the one hand, you know, it is honest.
[6396.58 → 6397.64] It is truthful.
[6397.78 → 6403.64] It is factual to say this machine starts at $1,199 or whatever the case may be.
[6403.64 → 6410.92] But it is not representative if you know that the configuration that makes any sense is more like $1,500.
[6412.44 → 6419.10] So, generally speaking, what we would like to do is we would like to review the configuration that we think makes sense.
[6419.16 → 6420.14] The problem is you can get it wrong.
[6420.14 → 6432.96] What if the configuration that we think makes sense because it's only another $100 for the Core i7 doesn't make any sense because the thermal solution can't handle the extra heat output from the Core i7, and it ends up throttling to the performance of the Core i5 anyway.
[6433.22 → 6435.58] That's a very real problem in laptops.
[6437.74 → 6440.36] So, we don't have a perfect answer.
[6441.22 → 6447.00] You know, in a perfect world, we'd love to just test every single configuration, and then we can tell you which one's the best one.
[6447.12 → 6447.30] Yeah.
[6447.30 → 6451.66] We had the ambitious goal of doing that once with the M1 MacBook.
[6452.32 → 6453.20] We actually bought them all.
[6453.30 → 6454.12] We bought like 20 of them.
[6454.56 → 6460.44] And then, long story short, we just didn't have the testing capacity, and they ended up getting distributed for internal use.
[6460.54 → 6463.26] Thankfully, we have a lot of Mac users now, so it wasn't a complete waste.
[6463.64 → 6466.12] But, um, got them.
[6469.18 → 6470.80] And I got one more for you here.
[6471.04 → 6471.24] Yeah.
[6471.24 → 6471.74] Hi.
[6471.74 → 6471.80] Hi.
[6471.94 → 6480.88] Part of the 1% of the viewer audience here got recommended to only WAN show at first a few years ago due to all the podcasts I watch.
[6481.38 → 6484.62] What part of the YouTube algorithm keeps on surprising you?
[6484.76 → 6485.94] Live Gods 100%.
[6485.94 → 6486.08] Oh, yeah.
[6486.08 → 6486.34] Yeah.
[6486.34 → 6487.42] Yeah, not just WAN show.
[6487.78 → 6496.68] The way that just random, like, three-hour videos of me building a computer will get three, four, five million views.
[6496.68 → 6504.96] Whereas if we had actually put in the work to cut that down to a digestible length, it would get a fraction of that.
[6505.08 → 6506.40] I just, I can't fathom it.
[6506.52 → 6520.44] And I can tell you guys, I do know that the algorithmic system that recommends Gods of previously live content is separate from regular Gods, which is separate from shorts.
[6520.54 → 6522.74] They are separate but related.
[6522.74 → 6528.06] Um, so I can tell you that for sure, and it never ceases to surprise me.
[6528.22 → 6545.14] It seems weird to me because myself as a viewer, the amount of times that I'm going to want to go watch a GOD of a previously ran live stream is honestly very low.
[6545.30 → 6546.64] No, but it just autoplays.
[6546.64 → 6550.18] Like, uh, I, I've seen, I've seen, it's, it's anecdotal, right?
[6550.18 → 6554.78] It's not perfect evidence, but I've, I've seen lots of people.
[6554.90 → 6556.50] And then the watch is fat.
[6556.68 → 6563.30] Who, who are like, yeah, I, I fell asleep watching LTT and like three times this week.
[6563.30 → 6568.00] And every single time when I woke up, it was that I love building computer stream.
[6568.00 → 6570.64] Like that is, that is a thing.
[6571.24 → 6571.56] Interesting.
[6571.76 → 6571.98] Okay.
[6574.14 → 6577.48] Oh, and I guess people are actually talking about it in float plane chat right now.
[6577.54 → 6577.76] Yes.
[6578.58 → 6580.20] People leave Gods on while going to sleep.
[6580.26 → 6580.38] Yeah.
[6580.42 → 6580.54] Yeah.
[6580.54 → 6581.06] A hundred percent.
[6582.16 → 6585.24] Uh, I guess, uh, do you guys want any pizza, or should we save it for?
[6585.34 → 6586.32] Oh, what kind of pizza is it?
[6586.40 → 6586.74] I don't know.
[6586.76 → 6587.02] I'll look.
[6587.22 → 6589.24] Why don't we save it for after dark, save it for after dark.
[6589.62 → 6590.02] All right.
[6590.08 → 6590.36] Okay.
[6590.66 → 6591.38] A couple more topics.
[6591.38 → 6592.18] Luke, what do you want to talk about?
[6592.26 → 6595.78] I kind of want to talk about, uh, rock star selling pirated copies of their own games.
[6595.86 → 6596.58] I was going to say the same thing.
[6596.60 → 6597.32] That's pretty funny.
[6598.00 → 6602.24] Rockstar has been caught selling cracked versions of their own games on Steam again.
[6602.72 → 6609.56] Developer Silent found a tag for Racer 1911, a Norwegian software cracking group, while
[6609.56 → 6615.10] looking through the hex codes for Midnight Club 2, which was delisted from Steam in 2018.
[6616.52 → 6621.42] According to information by Vadim M and Forehead, so hopefully I said those right.
[6621.52 → 6622.42] Well, Forehead, I'm pretty sure.
[6622.54 → 6626.32] But yeah, anyway, uh, this isn't the first time that Rockstar has been caught reselling
[6626.32 → 6627.78] pirated versions of their own games.
[6628.22 → 6633.58] Manhunt was first released on Steam in 2008, but for unclear reasons, it was unable to run
[6633.58 → 6637.30] on Windows Vista, despite the fact that the original disc copy could.
[6637.82 → 6642.40] However, a fix could be implemented by changing a single value in its code.
[6642.40 → 6649.72] The same fix that would allow the cracked version of the game created by Racer 1911 to work on Vista.
[6651.72 → 6652.28] Oops.
[6652.66 → 6653.08] Interesting.
[6653.42 → 6653.76] Interesting.
[6653.76 → 6665.04] In 2010, a user found that the Steam version of Max Payne 2 contained the logo of Wares Groups Myth in its code, which was removed a few days later, unsurprisingly.
[6665.52 → 6669.40] This was followed by an update to Manhunt, which utterly broke the game.
[6669.40 → 6680.36] This is likely because Rockstar replaced the cracked file with its own copy, which had been rendered unplayable due to anti-piracy measures put in place by Rockstar during development.
[6681.02 → 6681.66] Very cool.
[6682.30 → 6688.24] The games were originally sold with DRM copy protections and required a matching disc in the drive in order to run.
[6688.34 → 6689.78] That was up for the kids out there.
[6690.42 → 6691.48] That was a common thing.
[6691.62 → 6692.58] That was very common.
[6692.58 → 6699.68] But Rockstar also added additional booby traps meant to make the experience of playing a cracked copy miserable.
[6700.28 → 6710.52] In Manhunt, these included locking nearly every door in the game, crashing whenever the player acquires a health pickup, and disabling the mouse and keyboard if a player manages to get five headshots.
[6711.12 → 6713.48] These booby traps were quickly subverted.
[6713.48 → 6714.02] I do kind of love that.
[6714.02 → 6714.68] That is pretty funny.
[6715.22 → 6719.54] And the cracked version was released only three days after the official launch.
[6719.54 → 6727.32] I remember there were certain games where you could load the game with the game in your optical drive.
[6727.98 → 6732.48] And then if you were out of land, you could just eject it after the game was open and pass it to your buddy.
[6734.74 → 6741.16] Anyway, when Rockstar removed the copy protections, they failed to remove the booby traps that were set off.
[6741.32 → 6742.24] No way.
[6742.68 → 6749.28] By the absence of these copy protections, meaning that legitimate buyers over the last 13 years have been sold a broken game.
[6749.54 → 6752.56] However, the old executable remains in the Steam folder.
[6753.00 → 6753.32] Really?
[6755.40 → 6758.24] Simply renamed testapp.exe.
[6758.66 → 6761.74] Its hex codes also contain tags from Racer 1911.
[6762.18 → 6771.16] Most community patches to allow the Steam version of Manhunt to run still use this test app executable as a base rather than try to fix Rockstar's own version.
[6771.16 → 6776.62] I don't even think there's anything else to say here other than LOL.
[6776.62 → 6777.58] That's hilarious.
[6777.58 → 6778.14] LOL.
[6782.14 → 6787.38] Racer 1911 doing work allowing people to keep playing Rockstar Games.
[6787.62 → 6791.18] There is something to talk about.
[6791.18 → 6801.78] Okay, so clearly Racer 1911 is subverting, you know, piracy protections on copyrighted software.
[6801.78 → 6804.56] You can say what you want about people enabling piracy stuff.
[6804.78 → 6807.74] But that doesn't mean...
[6807.74 → 6811.62] Rockstar still is stealing their copyrighted code.
[6811.72 → 6813.20] Do two wrongs make a right?
[6813.46 → 6813.74] No.
[6814.50 → 6816.28] So what Rockstar's doing is still wrong.
[6817.38 → 6817.68] Yeah.
[6818.54 → 6823.50] I think it would be hilarious if Rockstar had to pay Racer.
[6826.16 → 6829.32] Well, Racer would have to reveal who they are.
[6829.42 → 6830.54] Yeah, that would be kind of...
[6830.54 → 6834.02] Maybe they just have to send, like, Bitcoin to some mysterious address or something.
[6834.02 → 6839.32] It's kind of like how you assume that, you know, your drug dealer's not going to call the cops when you don't pay them.
[6839.58 → 6839.88] Right.
[6839.88 → 6841.88] Yeah, they'll find a solution, but...
[6842.76 → 6842.88] Yeah.
[6844.26 → 6845.10] Oh, man.
[6845.40 → 6846.10] Very funny.
[6846.24 → 6850.02] I doubt anything's going to come of this because of basically what we just said.
[6850.18 → 6850.34] Yeah.
[6851.70 → 6855.52] But, yeah, that's brutal, and they should stop doing that.
[6855.60 → 6859.44] Ken K says, but to write, make an airplane.
[6862.24 → 6863.20] That's pretty good.
[6863.26 → 6864.16] I don't think I've heard that one before.
[6864.16 → 6865.64] Yeah, Dan's not there to ding the thing.
[6865.64 → 6875.70] Oh, in another small aside before we move on to our next topic here, or not another, in a small aside, we need some help.
[6876.14 → 6889.02] We're working on a video on 3D movie projection, passive 3D movie projection, and we are hoping that someone in our audience has some experience with passive 3D setups and could maybe give us a hand.
[6889.02 → 6901.04] We have a bald-out Stuart 3D screen coming in, but we've had some trouble acquiring appropriate filters, glasses, and I think we could probably find a projector.
[6901.04 → 6913.22] But if you have some recommendations, it turns out that the LS-12000 that I've been using in my theatre now, because of something-something, laser, something-something, it doesn't work for 3D.
[6913.22 → 6922.28] So please get in touch via our website contact form, which is at linusmediagroup.com slash contact-us, or email info at linusmediagroup.com.
[6922.28 → 6933.78] If you work in that industry, what's left of it, or if you have any old gear that you don't need anymore that we could borrow from you or buy off you or whatever the case may be.
[6933.78 → 6940.48] We're particularly interested in a quality setup, so not acrylic filters, glass filters, if possible.
[6941.08 → 6944.94] I've got kind of a whole series of videos that I want to do around it.
[6945.02 → 6959.56] I want to get some... I basically want to get 3D movies running, but I also found out that there are 2D to stereo 3D converters that you can just run modern games with, and I want to play around with that as well.
[6959.56 → 6968.28] I also want to set up a retro setup, so go back to GTX 280 or 480, whatever the last... No, 580s still did.
[6968.98 → 6975.40] Whatever the last driver and last generation of hardware that supported 3D Vision was, build the banging-est...
[6975.40 → 6976.50] The 580s still did?
[6976.60 → 6980.36] I believe so. The banging-est NVIDIA 3D Vision setup.
[6980.74 → 6981.88] I know 480s did.
[6982.40 → 6986.38] Hold on. Last driver to support NVIDIA 3D Vision.
[6986.38 → 6991.64] Yeah, so I had kind of like three video ideas in mind for it.
[6992.04 → 6993.22] Okay, here we go.
[6993.50 → 6994.92] Yeah, Turing.
[6995.06 → 6996.04] Only the 580 did.
[6996.30 → 6997.48] Turing supports it.
[6997.98 → 7004.56] The last driver that got it was Windows 10 64-bit standard 425.31.
[7005.08 → 7009.52] Man, this is something that makes me really sad.
[7009.52 → 7010.68] Okay?
[7012.60 → 7016.98] 3D Vision is going to be one of those forgotten, irretrievable gaming techs.
[7016.98 → 7017.40] You know why?
[7018.12 → 7023.44] Because by the time Windows 10 rolled around, people weren't buying physical copies of games.
[7023.72 → 7026.54] And if they were, they were running through Steam or something.
[7026.92 → 7031.36] So what's going to happen is Valve is going to drop support for Windows 10 someday.
[7031.36 → 7033.68] Not immediately, but someday.
[7034.22 → 7036.04] And even if you have a machine.
[7036.54 → 7038.80] Even if you have the 3D hardware.
[7039.30 → 7043.40] Even if you have copies of the games that technically do support it.
[7044.10 → 7045.54] You won't be playing it.
[7045.72 → 7046.44] Unless you pirate.
[7047.20 → 7048.88] I don't think that's a hot...
[7048.88 → 7049.26] I...
[7049.26 → 7052.40] I think we should care.
[7052.66 → 7054.22] So I almost don't even want to make this point.
[7054.34 → 7058.04] Because I've always been very rah-rah physical games for this exact reason.
[7058.12 → 7058.70] Stuff like that.
[7058.70 → 7064.38] But a lot of those games are able to be run through executables from the folder.
[7064.84 → 7066.08] So if you had a backup, you're fine.
[7066.42 → 7067.86] But what if it's a DRM issue?
[7068.02 → 7068.20] Yeah.
[7068.32 → 7070.22] You want to play Batman Arkham Asylum Game of the Year?
[7070.34 → 7070.86] Then you're screwed.
[7071.24 → 7071.88] It's a Steam game.
[7072.12 → 7072.34] Yep.
[7073.50 → 7074.04] That's it.
[7074.22 → 7074.58] That's all.
[7074.58 → 7076.64] In fact, I'm trying to think.
[7076.80 → 7079.02] I had a copy of not Game of the Year.
[7079.14 → 7079.50] And there was a whole thing with...
[7079.50 → 7080.70] It's going to be interesting because...
[7080.70 → 7081.48] Games for Windows Live.
[7082.30 → 7083.20] Oh, yeah.
[7083.58 → 7086.00] So Batman Arkham Asylum was a Games for Windows Live thing.
[7086.06 → 7087.66] So when Games for Windows Live went away,
[7087.66 → 7090.98] everyone who had a copy on Games for Windows Live got a Steam copy.
[7091.28 → 7093.86] So it is possible that no.
[7094.32 → 7096.36] That game, which was a 3D Vision title,
[7096.70 → 7098.34] simply doesn't exist outside of Steam.
[7098.44 → 7103.02] Imagine trying to go back to this era that we're in right now.
[7103.32 → 7104.66] Say it's 20...
[7105.80 → 7106.18] Hmm.
[7106.18 → 7108.74] Say it's 25 years from now.
[7109.46 → 7109.78] Yeah.
[7109.92 → 7114.00] And you want to go back and play Baldur's Gate 3.
[7114.38 → 7114.82] I don't know.
[7115.32 → 7115.94] Oh, yeah.
[7117.18 → 7118.76] I don't even know if that's a good example.
[7119.06 → 7121.52] But some game that came out recently.
[7121.66 → 7121.92] Sure.
[7122.32 → 7122.86] Diablo 4.
[7122.92 → 7124.20] The likeliness you won't...
[7124.20 → 7125.84] Oh, Diablo 4, you definitely won't be able to play.
[7126.52 → 7130.16] Because it's effectively like a weird form of an MMO.
[7130.16 → 7133.64] So like there's a lot of...
[7133.64 → 7135.70] Go back and try to play Fortnite in 25 years.
[7137.30 → 7138.88] It's like I probably...
[7138.88 → 7142.22] I'd argue that was the biggest game of the last like X amount of time.
[7142.72 → 7143.00] Oh, yeah.
[7143.06 → 7144.08] And I mean, even today,
[7144.20 → 7146.58] if you want to play Fortnite as it was five years ago,
[7146.62 → 7147.70] you can't do that.
[7148.20 → 7148.38] Yeah.
[7148.88 → 7149.08] Yeah.
[7149.64 → 7150.74] Oh, this is great.
[7150.98 → 7153.08] That last 3D Vision supporting driver,
[7153.90 → 7155.14] RTX 2080 Ti.
[7155.14 → 7160.16] I am going to play Arkham Asylum in stereo 3D
[7160.16 → 7162.60] like I could have never imagined it when it came out.
[7162.68 → 7162.76] Yeah.
[7162.84 → 7163.70] No, I'm like super stoked.
[7163.86 → 7163.98] What?
[7164.26 → 7164.40] Yeah.
[7164.46 → 7165.06] I'm really excited.
[7166.36 → 7166.76] Wow.
[7167.06 → 7167.40] Yeah.
[7167.68 → 7168.10] All right.
[7168.18 → 7168.36] Yeah.
[7168.40 → 7170.60] So I've got like a whole series of videos planned.
[7171.02 → 7172.44] So if you...
[7172.44 → 7173.64] We have had some trouble though.
[7173.66 → 7175.20] Is that a rare NVIDIA W?
[7175.50 → 7176.94] Like do we have to give it to them on that?
[7177.24 → 7180.76] That's a long support window for something that people were not really using.
[7181.00 → 7181.24] Yeah.
[7182.12 → 7183.56] NVIDIA's software support.
[7183.56 → 7185.62] Love or hate NVIDIA.
[7185.72 → 7187.76] And they do make mistakes even on the software side.
[7187.82 → 7190.26] They've got like outstanding bugs that have been sitting there forever
[7190.26 → 7191.06] that should have been dealt with.
[7191.18 → 7191.78] Like any company,
[7191.94 → 7196.04] their driver control panel looks like it's from 15 years ago.
[7196.20 → 7197.36] Like, yeah, they've got their issues.
[7197.98 → 7200.54] But in terms of hardware product support,
[7201.34 → 7205.82] man, how long has the NVIDIA Shield had support?
[7205.90 → 7206.80] I mean, it's still an active product.
[7206.80 → 7208.86] Top Gear mentioned Phys is still supported.
[7209.64 → 7211.38] Like, for example, in Mafia 2.
[7212.50 → 7212.90] Yep.
[7213.56 → 7214.42] Yeah, 100%.
[7214.42 → 7215.16] We'll give them that.
[7215.66 → 7215.88] Yep.
[7216.28 → 7219.66] So you got to give them credit where it's due
[7219.66 → 7221.44] because otherwise when you criticize them,
[7221.82 → 7223.18] people can't take it seriously, right?
[7223.52 → 7224.48] Yeah, exactly.
[7226.26 → 7227.08] The newsletter.
[7227.30 → 7228.66] Oh, no, I haven't mentioned the newsletter.
[7228.66 → 7228.94] Newsletter?
[7230.08 → 7232.26] We have an awesome...
[7232.82 → 7237.76] We haven't really done many newsletter updates for LTT Store lately,
[7237.76 → 7240.24] but we have a really cool one going out
[7240.24 → 7242.96] that you guys are going to want to make sure that you are signed up for.
[7244.26 → 7244.70] Oh.
[7244.70 → 7245.96] Really?
[7245.96 → 7245.98] Really?
[7246.04 → 7247.94] They don't give me any teasers in here or anything?
[7248.04 → 7248.40] Well, whatever.
[7248.56 → 7249.40] I read it.
[7249.84 → 7252.84] It's all about what we've learned about injection moulding and plastics
[7252.84 → 7257.52] as we've explored different colours for the screwdriver
[7257.52 → 7261.22] and lead up to LTX and in some of the upcoming products.
[7261.22 → 7267.84] So it gets into the fine details of how the colouring is done
[7267.84 → 7271.84] and what that affects and hot pressing versus cold pressing
[7271.84 → 7274.84] the ratchet assemblies into the handles.
[7274.84 → 7277.08] And what we were...
[7277.08 → 7278.24] We've got like a...
[7278.24 → 7278.74] It's not...
[7278.74 → 7281.28] Sorry, I was going to say like a blown up version,
[7281.40 → 7282.14] but it's not blown up.
[7282.20 → 7283.40] It's like a cross-section.
[7283.74 → 7287.46] So the team ripped one out, created a cross-section of it,
[7287.48 → 7289.54] and they show like a cold press versus a hot press
[7289.54 → 7292.84] to show how our initial assumptions about hot press being better
[7292.84 → 7293.84] were actually not correct.
[7293.90 → 7299.76] It turns out that they both kind of eat into the handle in the same way,
[7300.06 → 7300.82] it turns out.
[7301.12 → 7302.66] Yeah, really, really cool update.
[7303.06 → 7304.48] So you can sign up for the newsletter.
[7304.84 → 7305.10] Sorry?
[7308.04 → 7308.80] I'm over it.
[7310.06 → 7311.40] Oh, okay, fine.
[7311.50 → 7313.56] If it's on my WAN show email, then I'll look at it.
[7313.56 → 7314.22] But it's a newsletter, right?
[7314.28 → 7316.20] Couldn't we just go look at it on the store?
[7316.44 → 7317.34] I don't think it's up yet.
[7317.84 → 7319.68] I think it's going out this weekend or something like that.
[7320.16 → 7321.22] I'm pretty sure it's up.
[7322.00 → 7323.00] Okay, yeah, here we go.
[7323.80 → 7324.42] Minus laptop.
[7325.24 → 7326.36] Tools, tools, tools.
[7326.84 → 7328.68] It's been a year since the screwdriver launched.
[7330.66 → 7333.20] So, yeah, you can kind of see all that stuff.
[7333.20 → 7334.82] Are we allowed to use that?
[7334.88 → 7335.18] You know what?
[7335.26 → 7336.62] I'm not going to overthink that.
[7338.24 → 7339.46] This is a whole rabbit hole.
[7340.44 → 7342.44] This, like, swirly thing here that's going on.
[7342.54 → 7342.66] Yeah.
[7342.74 → 7345.50] Anyway, this is the thing that happened.
[7347.80 → 7348.46] Oh, my.
[7348.70 → 7349.02] Yep.
[7349.02 → 7353.22] Anyway, wow, that hair.
[7353.70 → 7354.22] Doesn't matter.
[7354.32 → 7355.76] The point is, really cool newsletter.
[7355.90 → 7357.36] You can sign up at ltdstore.com.
[7357.94 → 7360.14] And that newsletter is on the store.
[7360.58 → 7360.94] Oh, is it?
[7361.12 → 7361.32] Okay.
[7361.48 → 7362.72] Yeah, you can also go check it out there then.
[7365.20 → 7368.42] Mozilla Report finds that cars are a privacy nightmare.
[7369.86 → 7371.14] Nobody saw this one coming.
[7371.26 → 7371.98] This is wild.
[7371.98 → 7377.32] Speaking of things, we should have flipped the desk over when it initially started happening
[7377.32 → 7383.04] and people have just accepted enough that it is happening.
[7383.70 → 7390.46] According to Mozilla Foundation Report on 25 car brands, which, like, how many car brands
[7390.46 → 7391.00] are I going to say?
[7391.12 → 7394.02] That is actually a very substantial amount of car brands.
[7394.12 → 7399.62] Cars are the worst product category they have ever reviewed for privacy.
[7399.62 → 7406.34] Every single brand failed to meet Mozilla's minimum privacy standards and collected excessive
[7406.34 → 7410.96] amounts of personal information, including photos, calendar information, location, driving
[7410.96 → 7414.94] speed, musical tastes, race, immigration status, and medical information.
[7415.82 → 7422.86] Both Kia and Nissan permit the collection of data regarding a user's sex life, and six car
[7422.86 → 7428.10] companies permit the collection of genetic information or genetic characteristics.
[7428.10 → 7435.76] 84% of the car brands share personal user data with service providers and data brokers.
[7436.24 → 7439.50] 76% claim the right to sell the information.
[7440.12 → 7444.90] And 56% are willing to share user information with the government and or law enforcement if
[7444.90 → 7445.36] requested.
[7446.04 → 7453.04] Tesla, surprise, surprise, was the worst ranked company in the survey and failed every single
[7453.04 → 7455.38] one of Mozilla's privacy criteria.
[7455.38 → 7455.56] Yeah.
[7455.72 → 7456.50] You know what's crazy?
[7457.90 → 7459.84] You know what is squeaky clean on this list?
[7462.56 → 7462.92] Acura?
[7463.18 → 7463.82] My car.
[7464.02 → 7464.28] Really?
[7464.46 → 7466.00] Not the brand, but my car.
[7468.10 → 7470.12] Yeah, it doesn't have, like, smart anything, I don't think.
[7470.28 → 7470.46] Nope.
[7471.66 → 7473.34] You won't even pay for a map update.
[7473.48 → 7473.64] Nope.
[7473.70 → 7474.76] And rightly, you shouldn't.
[7474.80 → 7475.50] That is so stupid.
[7475.50 → 7476.32] It is very dumb.
[7476.40 → 7478.52] It's like hundreds of dollars, just in case anyone's wondering.
[7478.52 → 7479.26] It's like $400.
[7479.74 → 7480.66] It's really stupid.
[7480.66 → 7482.46] Yeah, it's not like two hundred dollars.
[7482.62 → 7483.06] It's a lot.
[7483.26 → 7485.06] I don't remember how much it is, but it's a lot.
[7485.58 → 7491.18] Mozilla also says that it could not confirm that any automaker met its minimum security
[7491.18 → 7495.66] standards regarding data encryption and protection against theft, and that car companies provided
[7495.66 → 7500.20] less detailed security information about their products than most dating apps and sex toy
[7500.20 → 7501.04] manufacturers.
[7501.04 → 7508.12] Mozilla said that it is typical advice to help consumers protect their personal data.
[7508.32 → 7509.30] Oh, that their tip.
[7509.36 → 7510.96] Oh, it's the wrong.
[7511.12 → 7512.00] It doesn't matter.
[7512.28 → 7512.88] Minor details.
[7513.30 → 7517.54] Said that their typical advice to help consumers protect their personal data feels inadequate
[7517.54 → 7522.32] given the circumstances, and that they have started a petition demanding car companies
[7522.32 → 7525.52] halt their current data protection programs.
[7526.38 → 7527.44] Discussion question.
[7527.44 → 7533.14] What should users do when there is no reasonable way to opt out of a highly invasive product
[7533.14 → 7534.64] within a given market?
[7535.24 → 7540.54] How has the automotive industry become this kind of wild west with respect to privacy?
[7540.86 → 7541.72] It's been pretty wild.
[7541.84 → 7547.30] This is a very small but legitimate reason why I haven't wanted to upgrade my car, and I'm
[7547.30 → 7547.70] not kidding.
[7547.82 → 7548.72] And I've mentioned this before.
[7549.08 → 7551.10] I actually like that my car is dumb.
[7554.30 → 7555.06] I don't know.
[7555.06 → 7561.42] There are certain things about mortifying a car that bother me and always have.
[7561.92 → 7564.28] DMA Casks, how does a car know about your sex life?
[7565.22 → 7566.16] Well, let me tell you.
[7567.36 → 7568.28] It knows where you're driving.
[7568.28 → 7569.06] When you don't own a house yet.
[7569.20 → 7570.20] It knows what time.
[7570.32 → 7571.66] Well, that too, to be honest.
[7571.86 → 7574.22] But it also knows where you're driving and at what time.
[7574.60 → 7574.72] Yeah.
[7575.72 → 7576.84] And for how long you're there.
[7576.94 → 7578.12] Your car knows a lot, man.
[7578.14 → 7578.88] Stuff like that.
[7579.56 → 7579.80] Yeah.
[7579.98 → 7580.28] Okay.
[7580.64 → 7583.02] This is great from Trent R. in Float plane Chat.
[7583.02 → 7590.38] Is it just a matter of the first politician getting their mistress outed by a smart car
[7590.38 → 7590.80] or something?
[7590.94 → 7592.90] And then all of a sudden, this starts changing?
[7593.16 → 7598.26] Or what's going to be the tipping point for this where it goes the other way?
[7598.38 → 7599.02] I don't know.
[7600.96 → 7601.80] Oh, man.
[7602.36 → 7602.54] Yeah.
[7602.94 → 7604.16] XFN 724.
[7604.44 → 7605.16] This is a perfect point.
[7605.24 → 7607.44] I think the second comment I've had from you this show.
[7607.44 → 7612.38] I drove a 91 car until 2021 when they wouldn't renew the inspection on it.
[7612.44 → 7617.12] So that's less of an issue here where you can not only drive ancient cars, but you even
[7617.12 → 7618.16] get cheaper insurance.
[7618.16 → 7619.42] You can get collector's plates and stuff.
[7619.52 → 7620.00] They ditched it.
[7620.14 → 7620.28] Yeah.
[7620.98 → 7622.48] They had a...
[7622.48 → 7622.74] What was it?
[7622.78 → 7623.14] Air care.
[7623.32 → 7623.46] Yeah.
[7623.78 → 7623.98] Yeah.
[7625.72 → 7628.00] Even then, there were exemptions for collectors and stuff.
[7628.00 → 7629.94] And there was very easy ways to get around it.
[7629.94 → 7630.10] Yeah.
[7630.14 → 7631.92] It was the whole thing, which is why they ditched it.
[7631.92 → 7637.96] But in a lot of places, it's not even how harmful the emissions are or anything like
[7637.96 → 7638.12] that.
[7638.16 → 7641.66] In a lot of places, it's as simple as, oh, your car's older than that?
[7642.42 → 7646.00] We will not even try to inspect it.
[7646.34 → 7653.18] And basically, that car just gets put on a ship and sent somewhere else where it will
[7653.18 → 7656.58] continue to emission, however it was here.
[7656.58 → 7658.56] I don't really understand what problem you think you're solving.
[7658.56 → 7663.06] And then you just have to buy a new one.
[7663.46 → 7664.14] It's that simple.
[7664.90 → 7666.70] I noticed this when I was in Germany.
[7667.54 → 7668.78] I was like, there's no...
[7668.78 → 7669.58] And Singapore, too.
[7669.78 → 7671.14] There's no old cars on the road.
[7671.18 → 7671.56] What the heck?
[7672.50 → 7679.58] In Singapore, it was explained to me that the lottery system for even getting a license
[7679.58 → 7687.80] to drive is so expensive to corruptly bribe your way to winning all the time that basically
[7687.80 → 7691.46] the only people who can afford to drive a car are the ones who can afford to drive a nice
[7691.46 → 7691.68] car.
[7692.16 → 7694.44] That was the way it was explained to me by someone from Singapore.
[7694.62 → 7696.04] I have no idea if it's still the case.
[7696.10 → 7697.00] That was a long time ago.
[7697.30 → 7697.84] And who knows?
[7697.90 → 7698.80] Maybe they were misinformed.
[7698.80 → 7708.90] But in Germany, my understanding is that they simply do not allow you to drive a super
[7708.90 → 7709.74] old car.
[7709.90 → 7715.82] So guys, please, please let me know if I am mistaken.
[7716.38 → 7718.04] Oh, I thought you didn't tell people what car you drive.
[7718.46 → 7718.88] No, I do.
[7719.20 → 7720.88] It's been in Scrapyard Wars and stuff.
[7720.92 → 7721.24] People know.
[7721.94 → 7723.28] Oh, I've always avoided it.
[7723.62 → 7724.34] Oh, no, no, no.
[7724.60 → 7724.84] All right.
[7725.60 → 7725.96] Cool.
[7725.96 → 7728.08] It's been on camera like a bunch of times.
[7728.34 → 7732.66] There's even, if you remember, I watched this recently because someone was asking who
[7732.66 → 7735.38] Nick Van Burke was, a random conversation.
[7736.06 → 7742.24] But I brought up Channel Super Fun and saw when we pranked, I think it was us pranking
[7742.24 → 7744.48] Burke that the office got broken into or whatever.
[7744.82 → 7745.10] Nice.
[7746.04 → 7746.76] Oh, wait, no.
[7747.56 → 7751.68] It was us pranking you for something that your car didn't work.
[7751.68 → 7752.02] Oh, yeah.
[7752.10 → 7755.88] It was when you guys said that my flight got moved.
[7755.96 → 7756.90] My flight time got moved.
[7757.08 → 7757.28] Yeah.
[7757.42 → 7758.50] And I offered to drive you.
[7758.56 → 7759.98] My car is like in that video.
[7760.04 → 7760.90] And that was back then.
[7761.20 → 7762.60] So it's been around forever.
[7763.18 → 7763.54] Yeah.
[7763.54 → 7767.22] There are some questions that I sort of have about this.
[7767.92 → 7769.44] My understanding of Germany is wrong.
[7769.52 → 7772.38] In fact, you don't pay taxes for your car once it becomes an old timer.
[7772.82 → 7773.04] Okay.
[7773.06 → 7774.42] Then maybe it's just a cultural thing.
[7774.86 → 7779.56] I do know that there are countries where, yeah, they basically just, I mean, the person
[7779.56 → 7783.46] who left this comment lives in one of them, clearly, where old cars, they simply won't
[7783.46 → 7785.12] renew your inspection for the most part.
[7785.56 → 7788.28] Maybe with Germany, it's just more of just like a culture thing.
[7788.86 → 7789.48] Oh, okay.
[7789.54 → 7790.32] No, hold on a second.
[7790.96 → 7794.42] As a German, most cars are killed by TOUR.
[7794.54 → 7795.26] I don't know what that is.
[7795.50 → 7796.96] Safety roadworthiness.
[7797.10 → 7798.42] Not general too old.
[7798.42 → 7803.42] Ah, so it's that the regulations change and that car is no longer considered roadworthy.
[7803.52 → 7803.66] Okay.
[7803.70 → 7804.66] I knew there was something.
[7805.08 → 7805.38] Okay.
[7805.48 → 7807.26] Thank you for clarifying that.
[7808.64 → 7809.14] Okay.
[7809.34 → 7809.60] Yeah.
[7809.78 → 7810.90] Very, very interesting.
[7812.68 → 7813.94] What else we got here?
[7814.04 → 7817.42] Oh, the video game voice actors are considering a strike.
[7818.06 → 7818.54] Yeah.
[7818.62 → 7823.86] The actors union SAG-AFTRA has decided to hold the general vote on whether to authorize,
[7823.98 → 7827.16] that's pretty key here, a strike against video game companies.
[7827.16 → 7831.26] This doesn't necessarily mean that a strike will happen, just that if the vote is successful,
[7831.58 → 7837.46] they will have the authority to call a strike when negotiations, when slash if negotiations
[7837.46 → 7837.92] fail.
[7838.22 → 7843.44] The union is seeking similar terms to what they asked of TV and film companies, like an
[7843.44 → 7846.08] 11% wage increase and protections from AI.
[7846.40 → 7851.92] The last time video game voice actors held a strike was in October 2016, which lasted
[7851.92 → 7854.48] 340 days.
[7854.48 → 7859.32] The eventual agreement included a new bonus system and increased transparency during the
[7859.32 → 7864.32] hiring process so that actors would know at least the genre of the game and whether their
[7864.32 → 7870.16] work would include profanity, slurs, sexual or violent themes, or physical stunts.
[7870.20 → 7870.76] What the heck?
[7870.84 → 7871.10] What?
[7871.48 → 7872.50] For a voice actor?
[7872.84 → 7873.22] Okay.
[7873.40 → 7873.66] Okay.
[7873.66 → 7877.92] The agreement did not guarantee residuals, a key point of contention.
[7878.58 → 7885.08] Reportedly, a stalemate has already been reached in negotiations with, surprisingly, Activision
[7885.08 → 7886.02] and Take-Two.
[7886.72 → 7887.34] Discussion question.
[7887.44 → 7888.96] What is the best way to help voice actors?
[7889.44 → 7893.34] What is the advantage slash disadvantage of having multiple sectors striking at once?
[7893.34 → 7894.34] Man.
[7896.50 → 7899.08] It might bring more attention to it as an advantage.
[7899.60 → 7902.62] I don't think there's a bunch other than that, though, to be honest.
[7902.90 → 7910.30] And I don't think that for outside a very vocal minority of really supportive gaming
[7910.30 → 7913.64] fans, I don't think that most will care.
[7914.02 → 7916.52] I think that they will just want their games.
[7916.52 → 7919.38] I mean, we've seen that.
[7919.60 → 7924.28] I'd love to say otherwise, but we just talked about horse armour earlier in the show.
[7924.50 → 7924.68] Yeah.
[7924.90 → 7929.02] Like, this isn't just true for gamers, if I'm being completely honest.
[7929.02 → 7931.14] This feels true for basically everything.
[7933.20 → 7933.84] Wait, what?
[7933.96 → 7934.12] Really?
[7935.70 → 7936.08] One sec.
[7936.12 → 7936.32] Sorry.
[7937.32 → 7938.28] No, it's still up.
[7938.60 → 7938.90] Okay.
[7941.02 → 7945.02] But, like, people will have stances on things.
[7945.02 → 7949.70] And then the second that those stances get challenged, if it inconveniences them, is less
[7949.70 → 7955.70] entertaining, or costs them any amount of money, it's decently common that those stances
[7955.70 → 7956.54] will then be ditched.
[7956.92 → 7958.94] Apparently, a lot of voice actors do mobcap as well.
[7959.08 → 7961.36] I just would have assumed someone else did the mobcap.
[7961.40 → 7962.20] I had no idea.
[7962.44 → 7963.30] It kind of makes sense.
[7963.66 → 7966.98] I mean, I could definitely see if someone's multi-talented or whatever.
[7967.10 → 7967.72] They might as well.
[7967.96 → 7968.82] But they don't necessarily...
[7968.82 → 7971.40] You're tying together the emotion of what you're saying with physical actions and your
[7971.40 → 7972.32] face and your...
[7972.32 → 7974.26] Oh, that's probably it.
[7974.26 → 7976.94] I bet you it's a bunch of facial movement stuff.
[7977.40 → 7981.46] Well, that wouldn't be a stunt, but, like, it could be tied into the whole capture.
[7981.66 → 7982.36] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7982.50 → 7983.38] Yeah, it makes sense.
[7984.14 → 7984.64] Hold on.
[7984.70 → 7985.56] One quick thing.
[7985.76 → 7986.44] Someone in Twitch chat.
[7986.60 → 7988.26] It's not changing regulations in Germany.
[7988.38 → 7991.00] It's just not worth repairing a car if it fails the TV.
[7991.76 → 7992.00] Okay.
[7992.44 → 7992.72] Okay.
[7992.88 → 7993.16] All right.
[7993.24 → 7993.64] Good to know.
[7993.86 → 7995.40] Or modifying or updating or whatever else.
[7995.82 → 7996.80] Thank you for the clarification.
[7997.06 → 7997.52] That's great.
[7997.94 → 8001.70] It doesn't change the point that some people will not have the option.
[8001.70 → 8003.08] You're discussing policy with Germans.
[8003.62 → 8004.48] They're going to be specific.
[8007.66 → 8009.74] Also, apparently part of what I said was right.
[8009.82 → 8013.28] And in some city centres, bans based on emissions do exist.
[8013.50 → 8013.78] Okay.
[8013.78 → 8015.92] So, I'm not completely wrong.
[8016.00 → 8016.82] I'm just German wrong.
[8020.06 → 8020.54] Right.
[8020.72 → 8022.54] So, back to the voice actor strike.
[8022.72 → 8023.80] So, here's my concern.
[8023.90 → 8025.06] And we've talked about this a little bit.
[8025.12 → 8030.68] Even though it's not really, you know, related to our industry being on YouTube.
[8030.68 → 8034.74] We have talked a little bit about SAG-AFTRA and about the Writers Guild strike.
[8035.26 → 8041.98] And what I have expressed before and what I'm going to express again is I think it's too late.
[8042.48 → 8047.68] I think it's too late for them to stop the AI onslaught.
[8047.68 → 8055.10] Because that's what all three of these have as at least one of their central themes.
[8055.10 → 8055.60] Protections from AI.
[8055.76 → 8060.76] Is protections against AI and protection for that there will be.
[8060.88 → 8073.22] I mean, in particular, the Writers Guild wants protections against just stuffing them in a room to, you know, turn some AI horse plop into something palatable with a tiny team.
[8073.22 → 8076.68] And then never even be on set so that there's no career advancement.
[8076.82 → 8078.02] That's what they're trying to prevent.
[8078.84 → 8084.78] And ultimately, I don't think any of the studios are interested in their career growth.
[8085.38 → 8088.32] They see the whole thing as transactional.
[8088.98 → 8094.54] And I think that now that the power of AI has been demonstrated.
[8094.72 → 8101.60] I think once ChatGPT3 broke ground, the horse was out of the barn.
[8101.60 → 8105.14] I think they saw, oh, we are this close.
[8105.28 → 8107.52] And maybe their perception is actually wrong.
[8107.86 → 8112.46] I mean, we've seen a lot of problems with large language models in their current form.
[8112.58 → 8114.34] They're not perfect.
[8114.98 → 8126.74] But I think to, let's face it, probably a pretty technologically Norrie person who might work as an executive at a film studio, it seems pretty great.
[8126.74 → 8144.04] And if they're looking at it going, okay, well, assuming explosive development in this area, like we see in tech, if they're just extrapolating based on what they've seen before, then it seems like we're so close that we can just twiddle our thumbs for a little bit here, not negotiate anything.
[8144.04 → 8153.24] And this problem will solve itself one way or the other, either with these people starving themselves to the point where they come crawling back for work or to the point where we just replace them with machines.
[8153.98 → 8154.38] Okay.
[8154.84 → 8155.64] I'll just wait.
[8156.08 → 8159.00] If the latter happens, movies are going to suck even more than they do now.
[8159.08 → 8159.50] I know, right?
[8159.50 → 8164.08] I will say there was some recent good ones.
[8164.42 → 8166.06] I haven't seen Oppenheimer, but I've heard it's good.
[8166.16 → 8167.10] And Barbie was great.
[8167.70 → 8174.20] But for years now, movies have been kind of not awesome, in my opinion.
[8175.94 → 8176.68] I am.
[8176.84 → 8185.00] Yeah, I'm scared for the video game voice actors' chances here.
[8185.00 → 8195.34] And just like I've said about the Writers Guild and, to a lesser degree, the Actors Guild, I think they have leverage.
[8195.50 → 8197.18] They have the star power, at least.
[8198.24 → 8208.30] But I think that in the same way that I've expressed concern about the Writers Guild, I just feel like the video game voice actors are going to come in hot.
[8208.30 → 8216.68] They're going to maybe feel good about their chances, and I think what they're going to find out is they have absolutely zero negotiating leverage.
[8217.22 → 8219.00] I don't know, man.
[8219.08 → 8234.88] I think that developers will just kind of go, okay, forget it then, and they will pivot to technological tools, and gamers will be enraged, and then they will buy the game anyway.
[8234.88 → 8240.52] Would you wager that there are more gaming studios than there are?
[8244.50 → 8246.34] I'm going to stop you here because I don't know.
[8246.76 → 8255.14] There's so many indies for both that I would have no idea how to compare the numbers.
[8255.80 → 8260.98] Because I feel like people are talking in chat right now about how I mentioned, oh, it's for facial animations.
[8261.18 → 8263.08] And you're like, yeah, but they said stunts, so it's more than that.
[8263.08 → 8275.76] So BG3, Bothers gate 3, someone mentioned, and this makes sense because they're perfect, but they mentioned that the voice actors did mobcap while they were talking.
[8276.10 → 8279.12] And the facial animations while people are talking are very good, so it makes sense.
[8279.36 → 8279.44] Right.
[8279.44 → 8290.22] So I wonder if a game like BG3 where all the lines are voice acted, and they have this mobcap on faces, and it's a perfect immersion quality beneficial part of the game.
[8290.72 → 8300.44] I wonder if certain studios will just opt to work with the new terms of the voice actors guild or alliance or...
[8300.44 → 8302.80] I'm not sure which actual...
[8302.80 → 8303.00] Oh, no.
[8303.14 → 8303.54] Okay.
[8303.68 → 8307.74] Apparently SAG-AFTRA is also the union of the video game voice actors.
[8308.00 → 8310.24] Based on what I'm meaning here, I don't actually know.
[8310.36 → 8311.92] I didn't know what union they were part of.
[8312.12 → 8312.50] Yeah, sorry.
[8312.50 → 8318.88] But yeah, I wonder if some studios will decide to work with them anyway, because they're like, this is going to be a quality differentiator for us.
[8319.60 → 8319.78] Maybe.
[8319.84 → 8323.24] That's honestly going to take a very long time for AI to catch up with properly.
[8323.90 → 8325.32] Yeah, you're probably right.
[8325.32 → 8338.02] But I also do wonder if in the same way that television studios just pivoted to reality TV and found out that people will just consume whatever deck they give them, I wonder if a lot of them will just not care.
[8338.74 → 8338.88] Yeah.
[8340.18 → 8347.72] As someone who actually doesn't really care about voice acting in games, I prefer to read, and I actually find it really distracting.
[8347.72 → 8355.96] One of the things that I like to do is I change the voice track to Japanese or something, because I find it way less distracting to have...
[8355.96 → 8362.74] Because I'll advance the text as fast as I can read it, which is at probably about six to eight times the speed that they will read the lines.
[8363.28 → 8368.36] And so I find it a lot less distracting to have words cut off in the middle of them when they're in a language I don't understand.
[8370.64 → 8371.48] I don't care.
[8372.52 → 8376.34] But I know a lot of people really like voice acting in games.
[8376.34 → 8376.94] I very much appreciate it.
[8376.94 → 8386.06] Not only do I find it's a big immersion bonus, but also just with my troubles with reading, it's nice.
[8386.48 → 8389.48] It feels a lot more relaxing to not have to read.
[8391.16 → 8393.22] And it also just...
[8393.22 → 8396.70] I can go so much faster because I'm not getting lost in text or whatever else.
[8397.46 → 8398.42] Minor dyslexic.
[8400.74 → 8401.18] Yeah.
[8401.70 → 8402.10] I don't know.
[8402.10 → 8410.24] People do not like my skipping voice acting.
[8411.34 → 8412.00] You're skipping.
[8412.22 → 8412.42] Oh.
[8412.64 → 8413.00] I don't know.
[8413.28 → 8414.24] I just, I don't like it.
[8414.28 → 8414.60] It's slow.
[8414.60 → 8415.72] It's a personal preference thing.
[8415.76 → 8416.56] Yeah, it's just slow.
[8416.56 → 8417.48] I don't.
[8417.54 → 8420.20] I skip it sometimes if I'm not as interested in the conversation.
[8420.94 → 8422.26] Just space bar, space bar, space bar.
[8422.36 → 8422.92] Skip through it.
[8423.06 → 8424.24] But usually I don't.
[8424.62 → 8425.10] Oh, well, no.
[8425.18 → 8427.78] I don't skip reading it.
[8428.16 → 8429.22] Like, I want to know what's happening.
[8429.68 → 8433.82] I just don't want to, I just don't want to, I don't want to hear people say it.
[8434.08 → 8438.76] Like, I forget which Final Fantasy game switched to, like, full voice acting.
[8438.92 → 8439.88] Was it nine?
[8440.06 → 8440.72] I'm not going to know.
[8441.10 → 8441.32] Ten?
[8441.48 → 8445.88] Yeah, I can't remember, but I just, I hated it.
[8446.08 → 8446.94] I was like, this sucks.
[8447.30 → 8448.00] Bring back text.
[8448.62 → 8449.74] Let's go, text.
[8450.30 → 8450.62] I don't know.
[8450.62 → 8453.28] And, like, oh, man.
[8453.42 → 8458.80] Games that don't support tapping to completely fill in a text box.
[8459.00 → 8462.04] Like, when they're like, and you can't speed it up.
[8462.12 → 8464.64] I just, I want to throw my controller through the TV.
[8464.78 → 8465.52] I can't.
[8466.78 → 8467.94] Drives me absolutely crazy.
[8468.06 → 8469.12] That's never a problem for me.
[8469.50 → 8470.84] I can't keep up with it anyway.
[8471.64 → 8472.64] Apparently it was ten.
[8472.76 → 8474.04] Yeah, agreed Grand wig.
[8474.18 → 8477.14] Nine was so good.
[8477.48 → 8480.60] I can't, he has never played, like, any of the good Final Fantasy games.
[8480.62 → 8481.04] Fantasy games.
[8481.10 → 8482.18] He's played, like, eight.
[8482.52 → 8482.92] Yeah.
[8484.46 → 8485.44] Eight was great.
[8486.10 → 8486.96] I really liked it.
[8487.60 → 8488.76] And then I never played another one.
[8491.86 → 8494.48] I made it, like, 45 minutes into eight.
[8494.54 → 8495.50] And I was like, this is stupid.
[8496.52 → 8497.82] And I just, I couldn't.
[8498.14 → 8499.04] Sorry, I just couldn't.
[8499.62 → 8500.76] People do like eight.
[8500.94 → 8502.22] I just, yeah.
[8502.44 → 8503.70] It's not that I don't have patience.
[8503.76 → 8504.66] I just don't have time.
[8505.58 → 8508.94] That's, there's a big, there's, there's a big difference.
[8509.50 → 8510.46] Well, there isn't a big difference.
[8510.46 → 8511.28] They're kind of the same thing.
[8511.62 → 8515.24] Yeah, I tell people that I liked eight, and they get so offended because they're like,
[8515.34 → 8518.82] oh, like, six or seven or whatever was so much better.
[8518.94 → 8519.82] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[8519.92 → 8521.12] I can't believe you liked that one.
[8521.16 → 8523.46] I was like, it's the only one I play.
[8524.16 → 8524.84] I thought it was good.
[8524.98 → 8525.64] Like, I don't know.
[8525.94 → 8526.94] What do you want from me?
[8527.96 → 8528.62] Come on.
[8529.04 → 8529.40] Someday.
[8529.60 → 8530.56] Squall was awesome.
[8530.66 → 8531.68] I had the necklace.
[8532.02 → 8534.86] I had the necklace with the lion with the sword through the top.
[8534.96 → 8536.10] I had that for a while.
[8536.10 → 8537.70] Was it a sword gun or a gun sword?
[8537.92 → 8538.36] Gun sword.
[8539.34 → 8539.88] Gun blade.
[8540.00 → 8540.52] I don't care.
[8540.64 → 8541.54] To be more specific.
[8541.60 → 8542.40] Yeah, it sounds stupid.
[8542.54 → 8543.14] Yeah, it was sick.
[8543.24 → 8545.92] If you have a gun, why do you need a blade on it?
[8546.04 → 8546.72] What is this?
[8546.80 → 8548.92] Like the year 1850?
[8550.24 → 8551.18] Get your musket.
[8551.18 → 8551.40] Maybe.
[8555.24 → 8563.52] In other AI news, Gizmodo replaced Spanish languages' editor with machine.
[8565.14 → 8565.62] Geomedia.
[8565.64 → 8566.30] Signs with machine.
[8566.30 → 8574.60] Owners of Gizmodo have laid off the editorial team of the site's Spanish equivalent who used to translate articles and write their own original content.
[8575.10 → 8577.10] The site is not shutting down.
[8577.10 → 8582.40] Instead, it will be populated with machine translated articles from the English site.
[8584.16 → 8588.12] During the transition, I'm sure you guys know that hilarity will ensue.
[8588.58 → 8596.36] This is very sad for the people who lost their jobs, but it's funny that Geomedia is basically having this turn into a PR disaster immediately.
[8596.52 → 8597.34] That's the funny part.
[8597.86 → 8605.18] During the transition, some readers have complained of reading articles that start in Spanish, then switch to English partway through.
[8605.18 → 8606.74] Here's an example.
[8606.92 → 8609.04] And I'm about to butcher this, so get ready.
[8609.26 → 8609.72] Oh, no.
[8610.38 → 8611.14] Oh, no.
[8611.68 → 8614.90] La empress no responded de...
[8614.90 → 8615.56] Okay, it doesn't matter.
[8615.64 → 8616.18] The point is...
[8617.18 → 8621.26] That's probably why the form asks you to give your country of residence.
[8621.38 → 8624.32] It seems that Era is granting some people limited rights to...
[8624.32 → 8625.32] What is this?
[8626.80 → 8627.86] What the heck?
[8630.06 → 8632.20] I really...
[8632.20 → 8632.92] I don't know.
[8632.92 → 8640.08] I understand that GPT-4 and some of these other things are surprisingly good at translation, but I really think there's...
[8640.08 → 8640.42] Oh, no.
[8640.50 → 8641.92] Spanish would like a word with you.
[8642.28 → 8643.80] I don't speak Spanish.
[8643.80 → 8659.72] I think especially once you get into the nuances of language and when you get into, like, advanced levels of writing and people trying to get something across through indirectly referencing something and all these little subtleties that happen in natural language.
[8659.72 → 8667.60] I find it really hard to believe that AI translation is going to be able to keep up with this super well, especially over time.
[8667.72 → 8670.52] Like, if models are not being retrained and updated with current events.
[8670.52 → 8671.36] We're still going to need people.
[8671.48 → 8676.48] Like, we talked about using AI translation for dubbing for our videos.
[8676.48 → 8685.34] And even then, like, even at our scale, there was no possibility of us not having a human check them.
[8686.12 → 8690.38] Of course you're going to have to do that because otherwise you end up with this.
[8691.54 → 8696.36] In fairness to me, okay, my accent probably wasn't much worse than this translation.
[8696.36 → 8699.70] I was just reading...
[8699.70 → 8702.44] I mean, the translation just quits and starts reading English, so realistically...
[8702.44 → 8703.10] That's what I did.
[8703.12 → 8704.04] They were pretty similar.
[8706.40 → 8715.12] Geomedia has been experimenting with AI-generated articles since at least July, which initially ran without oversight or input from Gizmodo's own writing staff.
[8715.28 → 8721.16] It is unclear if these algorithmically produced articles will then be subject to machine translation and republished.
[8721.26 → 8721.90] Oh, my goodness.
[8722.02 → 8724.40] The dog's breakfast you would end up with.
[8724.40 → 8729.68] If you have an AI-generated article that then gets AI-translated into Spanish.
[8731.10 → 8731.96] Oh, no.
[8733.16 → 8733.84] Oh, no.
[8734.70 → 8735.14] All right.
[8736.36 → 8739.80] Line is with big translated by AI Spanish energy.
[8739.96 → 8740.58] Heck, yeah.
[8742.32 → 8742.84] Ah.
[8744.12 → 8745.00] Next topic.
[8746.32 → 8746.84] Yeah.
[8747.34 → 8748.22] Um, nah.
[8748.44 → 8749.46] Do we even want to talk about that?
[8749.54 → 8750.02] Oh, yeah.
[8750.20 → 8751.00] This is cool, though.
[8751.28 → 8751.96] Uh, framework.
[8752.18 → 8752.52] Oh, yeah.
[8753.08 → 8753.90] Investor disclosure.
[8753.90 → 8755.90] Found some old main boards.
[8756.06 → 8756.88] How does this happen?
[8757.58 → 8758.10] Well, see...
[8758.10 → 8758.54] Can you explain?
[8758.66 → 8760.10] That's the reason this is in here.
[8760.36 → 8763.46] Because on the one hand, I think this is super cool.
[8763.92 → 8773.12] Framework apparently found a load of old completed laptop main boards while they were shutting down the original factory that was producing the Framework 13 in China.
[8773.12 → 8779.44] Um, if you guys watched our recent factory tour, you'll know that Framework is now producing their laptops in Taiwan.
[8780.00 → 8785.26] Framework has decided to process these boards, update their firmware, and make them available to customers.
[8785.26 → 8794.82] The boards come with Intel Tiger Lake-based Core i5-1135G7 processors and will be available for $200, less than half the original price.
[8795.24 → 8804.40] And reminder, for those of you who don't know, Framework laptops have motherboards that can easily be run outside the laptop, which is super cool.
[8804.40 → 8807.74] Uh, these CPUs are based on Gen 12.
[8807.94 → 8809.30] They have XC graphics.
[8809.88 → 8811.18] Um, no, Gen 12.
[8811.28 → 8811.86] No, they're Gen 11.
[8811.96 → 8813.02] I don't know what this means.
[8813.12 → 8814.54] But they have XC graphics, apparently.
[8814.74 → 8820.12] And they come with four CPU cores, eight threads, and no performance or efficiency cores.
[8820.20 → 8821.40] They're just, they're just cores.
[8821.40 → 8825.30] So, on the one hand, yeah, that's super cool.
[8825.44 → 8835.08] And actually, if you just needed, like, a decently powerful and efficient single board computer, essentially, um, seems like a not terrible idea.
[8835.46 → 8840.60] On the other hand, again, as an investor, I have some concerns.
[8841.30 → 8842.48] Framework, what the heck?
[8842.60 → 8843.12] How do you just...
[8843.78 → 8846.28] How did you lose a bunch of motherboards?
[8848.64 → 8849.16] Guys!
[8849.16 → 8854.06] Here's the maybe silver lining, is they seem to have been doing fine.
[8855.06 → 8855.94] Yeah, without them.
[8858.34 → 8859.92] Maybe you wouldn't have needed my money.
[8862.02 → 8863.26] How does this happen?
[8863.44 → 8864.84] I mean, okay, look.
[8865.24 → 8873.18] You ask how this happens, but you literally work at the company that recently experienced some colossal communication issues.
[8873.18 → 8874.18] Oh, my God.
[8879.16 → 8880.48] So, on the one hand, yeah, I'm seeing you're doing...
[8880.48 → 8881.66] All right, framework, you're forgiven.
[8881.78 → 8882.96] I fully understand.
[8885.06 → 8886.90] I've experienced a lot worse.
[8888.98 → 8889.70] Good job.
[8893.10 → 8893.58] Woo!
[8893.84 → 8895.88] With that, should we, uh, After Dark?
[8895.96 → 8898.72] I think it's time for a WAN show After Dark.
[8899.44 → 8900.54] Maybe some pizza.
[8900.54 → 8901.44] Oh, man.
[8901.44 → 8911.34] Oh, boy.
[8911.34 → 8915.34] It's a good thing we're only talking to the people who watch WAN show for...
[8917.34 → 8917.94] Hours?
[8918.14 → 8919.86] Yeah, I was gonna check how long...
[8919.86 → 8920.50] Two and a half hours?
[8920.50 → 8921.34] Yeah, two and a half hours.
[8921.72 → 8922.86] You guys get us.
[8922.86 → 8923.36] Yeah.
[8927.62 → 8929.68] Luke with the immediate 180.
[8929.68 → 8934.68] I did kind of set you up for it, though.
[8934.82 → 8936.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8936.54 → 8937.36] It was pretty good.
[8937.64 → 8938.28] Oh, boy.
[8938.44 → 8938.84] All right.
[8938.96 → 8940.64] I'm starting at the top of potentials.
[8940.84 → 8943.80] Dan's getting us pizza, so he can't pick...
[8943.80 → 8945.82] We've temporarily lost a member of the show.
[8946.00 → 8947.22] I don't actually want any pizza.
[8947.38 → 8947.76] That's fine.
[8947.82 → 8948.36] Hold on, hold on.
[8948.40 → 8949.04] I'll replace him.
[8949.08 → 8949.36] One sec.
[8950.08 → 8951.04] I'll replace him?
[8951.92 → 8952.68] Oh, wow.
[8953.18 → 8953.42] Oh.
[8953.42 → 8953.48] Oh.
[8955.06 → 8955.96] There we go.
[8957.26 → 8958.88] I'll probably do a better job on that.
[8959.68 → 8963.80] Oh.
[8965.14 → 8965.58] Oh.
[8966.96 → 8968.06] That was my big effort.
[8968.60 → 8970.62] That was as much time as that gag was worth.
[8971.14 → 8971.40] Yeah.
[8971.64 → 8972.34] Yeah, that's fair.
[8972.66 → 8973.14] Ooh, pizza.
[8973.68 → 8975.88] Do you want some, Luke, or are you still off pizza?
[8976.00 → 8976.16] I'm off.
[8976.44 → 8976.96] Yeah, I figured.
[8977.76 → 8982.60] I wouldn't, like, if I know the day before or something, I can adjust things.
[8982.70 → 8983.62] I'm just a pinch check.
[8983.86 → 8985.58] I'm just a pinch check away from pizza.
[8985.58 → 8988.40] My pinch check is currently default failing, so that's okay.
[8988.60 → 8989.48] I'm doing pretty good, though.
[8989.72 → 8990.96] I'm happy with how things are going.
[8990.96 → 8993.08] Oh, I'm happy with how things are going.
[8993.14 → 8993.54] You look good.
[8993.70 → 8994.18] Yeah, thank you.
[8994.38 → 8995.74] Dan's been coming to the gym with me.
[8996.22 → 8996.48] What?
[8996.54 → 8997.20] Oh, that's awesome.
[8997.30 → 8997.50] Yeah.
[8997.66 → 8998.66] Yeah, it's been awesome.
[8998.66 → 9000.00] I came all three days this week.
[9000.10 → 9004.76] I'm probably going to be adding a fourth day to the rotation starting this week, but no
[9004.76 → 9006.06] one wants to do that with me, which is fine.
[9007.54 → 9010.80] I'm already losing three days of my week.
[9011.32 → 9011.54] Yeah.
[9011.62 → 9013.78] I have to do some work at some point.
[9014.52 → 9014.72] Yeah.
[9014.96 → 9018.86] You know, I don't usually do Domino's.
[9019.24 → 9022.14] I'm kind of like a Pan ago or, like, smaller pizza place guy.
[9022.14 → 9022.72] You should try.
[9022.72 → 9027.98] I'm going to shout out a local place, and hopefully I don't ruin it that way, but Clayton Gate
[9027.98 → 9029.44] Pizza is amazing.
[9029.66 → 9032.02] What is garlic flavoured sauce?
[9033.48 → 9035.26] Anything called just...
[9035.26 → 9035.90] Flavoured.
[9036.02 → 9037.42] There are no ingredients on it.
[9037.82 → 9038.30] Oh.
[9039.08 → 9041.02] Anything just called sauce.
[9041.14 → 9042.38] Like, is it a mayo?
[9043.22 → 9043.72] Is it a...
[9043.72 → 9043.98] You know?
[9044.22 → 9045.76] Am I overthinking this?
[9047.20 → 9050.42] Coagulated garlic flavoured liquid.
[9050.42 → 9054.16] People say probably garlic butter, but I don't think so because garlic butter has garlic
[9054.16 → 9054.54] in it.
[9054.80 → 9057.44] It's probably oil and xanthan gum.
[9057.56 → 9058.60] Yeah, they wouldn't...
[9058.60 → 9061.84] Thanks, Dan.
[9062.14 → 9062.86] I'm looking...
[9062.86 → 9064.12] He's probably right.
[9064.20 → 9065.20] I'm looking up the ingredients.
[9065.42 → 9066.04] I'm going to eat it.
[9066.78 → 9067.60] Oh, man.
[9069.00 → 9069.60] All right.
[9070.58 → 9071.70] Oh, it does...
[9071.70 → 9073.64] Oh, kind of...
[9073.64 → 9074.26] I don't know.
[9076.04 → 9079.36] My other options are marinara and ranch, though, so I'm sorry.
[9079.36 → 9080.40] I can't eat ranch.
[9081.20 → 9082.34] Ever since I...
[9082.34 → 9083.54] You're a no ranch kind of person?
[9083.62 → 9083.78] Yeah.
[9083.86 → 9085.52] Well, I'm not a no ranch kind of person.
[9086.00 → 9086.36] I'm an...
[9087.40 → 9093.22] I ate nothing but ranch dressing on every vegetable or salad for, like, the first 15 years of my
[9093.22 → 9095.00] life person, and now I can't even look at it.
[9095.98 → 9096.84] I'm one of those.
[9096.98 → 9102.52] So that's why I say my, like, I'm allergic to eggs line because I don't want to have a
[9102.52 → 9105.36] conversation about it, so I just say I'm allergic even though I'm not.
[9105.80 → 9107.46] I just can't eat them anymore.
[9107.50 → 9108.24] That's me and seafood.
[9108.24 → 9108.88] Yeah.
[9109.04 → 9114.44] Because the second you say you don't like seafood, seafood people will try to get you
[9114.44 → 9116.44] to try a seafood that they're sure that you'll like.
[9116.54 → 9116.76] Yeah.
[9117.10 → 9119.00] And I'm just like, I don't feel like talking about it.
[9119.10 → 9119.50] Exactly.
[9119.86 → 9120.56] Um, yeah.
[9120.60 → 9122.70] I don't like seafood.
[9122.94 → 9126.16] And then, and then what's hilarious is people will catch me eating scallops.
[9127.42 → 9128.80] And they'll be like, I thought you don't eat...
[9128.80 → 9129.98] I thought you're allergic to seafood.
[9130.20 → 9131.38] And then I'll have to explain.
[9131.48 → 9132.56] Actually, I lied to you.
[9132.80 → 9134.36] I am not allergic to seafood.
[9134.36 → 9136.60] I'm just allergic to seafood that tastes like s***.
[9137.00 → 9137.40] Oh!
[9138.06 → 9138.58] So...
[9138.58 → 9139.20] I like seafood.
[9139.20 → 9143.32] The problem for me is that I don't like the super ocean taste.
[9143.84 → 9147.96] And I also don't like playing Russian roulette with my food.
[9147.96 → 9148.76] Hmm.
[9149.30 → 9155.36] So, for something like, um, for something like prawns, good prawns that don't have that
[9155.36 → 9159.82] super, like, seafood-y flavour are delicious.
[9160.14 → 9160.52] Oh, yeah.
[9160.76 → 9161.74] Like, so good.
[9162.40 → 9166.98] But then if I get one that has that, like, Hyperborean taste, and do you know what I'm
[9166.98 → 9168.68] talking about with the ocean taste?
[9168.72 → 9169.86] I do, but I don't actually mind it.
[9169.94 → 9171.74] I am exactly the same way as you, Linus.
[9171.74 → 9171.86] Yeah?
[9171.86 → 9172.40] So, yeah.
[9172.40 → 9173.64] I tell people I don't like fish.
[9174.16 → 9175.24] It's just the fish taste.
[9175.48 → 9180.82] For me, for me, that, that, that ocean taste is, is an immediate turn-off.
[9181.14 → 9182.92] And for me...
[9182.92 → 9184.10] I definitely like, yeah.
[9184.26 → 9188.02] Playing, like, maybe this will be delicious, or maybe this will make me want to gag.
[9188.20 → 9188.82] It's not worth it.
[9188.84 → 9190.72] It's, it's like, it's not worth it.
[9190.72 → 9195.48] See, I don't, I don't get that, like, for, so, when I was growing up for about two weeks
[9195.48 → 9201.98] out of, out of most, ah, for probably about four or five years there, for two weeks out
[9201.98 → 9206.04] of every one of those years, I would go on a camping trip with my best friend's family,
[9206.54 → 9212.60] and we would have probably more than half of the food that we had during that camping
[9212.60 → 9215.16] trip would be pulled from the ocean in some way.
[9215.86 → 9221.86] Crab traps, um, shrimping nets, or whatever they were, um, standard fishing off the back
[9221.86 → 9222.52] of a boat, whatever.
[9222.52 → 9229.04] We'd eat what we caught, basically, and that sort of temporarily ruined me on seafood, because
[9229.04 → 9235.90] then any other less fresh seafood was now bad, because I had experienced that, but then
[9235.90 → 9237.40] that faded over time, and now it's fine.
[9237.48 → 9240.62] But I've never minded the, the ocean taste at all.
[9240.78 → 9242.64] We did one family trip down to Port Townsend.
[9244.26 → 9252.50] I think on that trip alone, I probably ate more mass of seafood than I have.
[9252.52 → 9254.26] And probably the rest of my adult life.
[9254.38 → 9256.26] Because it's, it's, it hits a little different.
[9256.38 → 9261.92] All we did was put down crab traps, pull up crabs, dip them in butter, and eat them, like
[9261.92 → 9262.50] for a week.
[9263.18 → 9267.50] Um, and it was, yeah, and like when it's good, it's so good.
[9267.58 → 9272.18] So like at a, at a restaurant like Banana Leaf, I'll order the like abundance of seafood
[9272.18 → 9272.62] dish.
[9273.48 → 9276.04] And I'll, I'll eat basically everything in it.
[9276.06 → 9279.38] You won't get me to eat a mussel with a gun to my head, but there's, there's like pretty
[9279.38 → 9280.36] much everything else in it.
[9280.88 → 9284.12] I'll eat because I know that it's going to be like perfect quality, but.
[9284.56 → 9286.12] Mussels are like, yeah, those are those.
[9286.20 → 9288.84] I had to Google it because I had to see if they were different from clams and oysters,
[9288.98 → 9290.52] but those are, those are still super seafood.
[9290.66 → 9290.80] Yeah.
[9291.28 → 9291.46] Yeah.
[9291.58 → 9291.78] Yeah.
[9291.84 → 9293.20] I just, I actually, see, I like those.
[9293.20 → 9294.48] It's also a texture thing for me.
[9294.64 → 9295.94] It's, it's like eating a slug.
[9296.24 → 9296.84] Like I just.
[9297.02 → 9299.42] To be clear, I knew they were different, but I wanted to see the picture of it to see
[9299.42 → 9301.24] exactly which one it was because I didn't fully remember.
[9301.38 → 9305.94] I'm also, I'm also super like, like texture sensitive.
[9306.18 → 9311.08] So there's like, there are fruits that I won't eat because like the, the texture bothers me
[9311.08 → 9313.22] or, or they're a big gamble.
[9313.46 → 9317.22] So I like fruits that I can tell from the outside what they're going to taste like.
[9317.22 → 9318.22] So I love apples.
[9319.40 → 9319.80] Grapes.
[9319.92 → 9322.28] You can tell just by like touching them if they're going to be good.
[9322.28 → 9327.20] And whereas fruits that you can't tell, so like a pomelo or however you pronounce
[9327.20 → 9333.40] it, those, like I'll, I like them enough that I'll try a little taste, but in general,
[9333.42 → 9337.34] like I won't go out of my way to go peel one because there's a strong probability that it
[9337.34 → 9338.92] will be bitter or something like that.
[9338.92 → 9339.54] I don't think I've ever had one of these.
[9339.54 → 9340.24] Yeah, it's just not worth it.
[9340.46 → 9342.54] When they're good, man, are they ever good.
[9342.72 → 9342.84] Yeah.
[9342.88 → 9344.14] They're, they're like really delicious.
[9344.44 → 9344.64] Cool.
[9344.64 → 9349.54] But I just, I don't like stuff that is, I don't like stuff that's, that's a gamble.
[9349.54 → 9350.54] Cool.
[9350.54 → 9356.76] I'm not a huge fan of, of mush or like slimy, but either of those textures will throw me
[9356.76 → 9357.76] off like hard.
[9357.76 → 9358.76] Buy grapes at TNT.
[9358.76 → 9359.76] The crunchy ones?
[9359.76 → 9360.76] Oh, they're so good.
[9360.76 → 9361.76] Those are so good.
[9361.76 → 9362.76] They're so good.
[9362.76 → 9363.76] Autumn crisp.
[9363.76 → 9364.76] Autumn crisp.
[9364.76 → 9365.76] Get some Concord grapes.
[9365.76 → 9366.76] I have to tell you guys.
[9366.76 → 9367.76] Musket grapes.
[9367.76 → 9369.76] Man, I've had ones that are like, they feel like hand fruit.
[9369.76 → 9375.44] Like you put one grape in your mouth, and you're like, oh, oh, oh, it's so good.
[9375.44 → 9376.44] Yeah.
[9376.44 → 9377.44] Yeah.
[9377.44 → 9380.84] Anyway, should we start the messages of merch?
[9380.84 → 9381.84] Sure.
[9381.84 → 9382.84] Yeah.
[9382.84 → 9383.84] We've got lots of potential.
[9383.84 → 9385.84] So if you guys want to hop them down, go for it.
[9385.84 → 9386.84] First off here.
[9386.84 → 9392.40] Hey, DLL, first LTC store buy plus first merch message.
[9392.40 → 9395.24] Thanks for inspiring my interest in tech.
[9395.24 → 9398.32] Do you have any advice for working through decision paralysis?
[9398.32 → 9401.82] Any breakthrough aha moments you personally had?
[9401.82 → 9402.82] Thanks.
[9402.82 → 9405.22] Um, I wanted advice.
[9405.22 → 9406.22] I like lists.
[9406.22 → 9407.22] Yeah.
[9407.22 → 9411.22] Like remember I was, I was telling, but, but this is going to get worse before it gets
[9411.22 → 9412.22] better.
[9412.22 → 9416.22] Remember when I read out my list of games that I have on my to play list last week?
[9416.22 → 9417.22] Mm hmm.
[9417.22 → 9422.62] And then remember how my brilliant idea for deciding which one to play was to have the
[9422.62 → 9424.02] one to play list.
[9424.02 → 9426.02] And then I was like, oh, I'm sorry.
[9426.02 → 9427.02] I'm sorry.
[9427.02 → 9428.02] Dang it.
[9428.02 → 9430.02] I was hoping he would have a solution.
[9430.02 → 9431.02] Yeah.
[9431.02 → 9436.02] Sometimes when I'm working on housework and stuff like that, I will just start walking.
[9436.02 → 9440.02] And then the first thing that I see that kind of looks amiss, I will fix it.
[9440.02 → 9446.42] I don't commonly employ this, but there's, there are two things.
[9446.42 → 9451.82] Um, one of them is a, a like calculation that you can kind of do that.
[9451.82 → 9456.42] You have to add some weights to it, which is like, uh, like what is the timeliness of
[9456.42 → 9457.42] this thing?
[9457.42 → 9463.42] Um, what, uh, how do I rank the importance of this, um, to myself?
[9463.42 → 9466.42] What is the like, yeah, it's like an important urgency, whatever.
[9466.42 → 9470.82] I use it for work, but you can also use it for personal stuff.
[9470.82 → 9477.42] Um, and another way to do it is I, the first time I ever heard of a pros and cons list,
[9477.42 → 9479.62] I like immediately hated it.
[9479.62 → 9480.82] And I was like eight.
[9480.82 → 9484.62] Cause even then I was like, this has flaws.
[9484.62 → 9489.42] Cause a lot of people are going to look at this and equate these, and they don't have the
[9489.42 → 9490.42] same weight.
[9490.42 → 9494.62] And you might have like, it has 10 pros and one con and the con is you die.
[9494.62 → 9495.62] Yeah.
[9495.62 → 9499.02] Like, there's, there are too many pros.
[9499.02 → 9500.02] I've got to do it.
[9500.02 → 9501.02] Like, that's just so dumb.
[9501.02 → 9502.02] Guess I'm dead now.
[9502.02 → 9502.42] Yeah.
[9502.42 → 9503.22] Like, Oh my God.
[9503.22 → 9504.22] So it's always bothered me.
[9504.22 → 9508.02] So something that I prefer to do, I rarely do this, but, uh, something that I do prefer
[9508.02 → 9512.92] to do is you, you, you do one of those like four, four cell grid systems with like urgent
[9512.92 → 9515.72] versus not urgent, important versus not important.
[9515.72 → 9518.62] And then you just do whatever's urgent and important and timeliness and all that kind of
[9518.62 → 9518.92] stuff.
[9518.92 → 9519.92] Yeah.
[9519.92 → 9520.32] Uh, but no, no, no, no.
[9520.32 → 9522.32] You, you do the four, four cell grid system.
[9522.32 → 9523.32] Oh.
[9523.32 → 9526.72] It's, it's then you do the pros and cons.
[9526.72 → 9530.12] Like, you know how sometimes you'll see those like political leaning ones.
[9530.12 → 9531.12] Oh, sure.
[9531.12 → 9531.52] Yeah.
[9531.52 → 9533.52] And you put different groups on there so you can understand.
[9533.52 → 9537.02] Sometimes Cause I'm like, I don't know where this newspaper lands or whatever.
[9537.02 → 9537.52] Sure.
[9537.52 → 9539.52] And then I want to know, and you, you see those grids.
[9539.52 → 9540.52] I do one of those.
[9540.52 → 9545.52] Um, then you do another one for whoever assigned that newspaper a spot on the grid.
[9545.52 → 9547.92] And then you do another one for whoever assigned them a thing.
[9547.92 → 9549.72] It's like, it's like impossible.
[9549.72 → 9550.12] Good luck.
[9550.12 → 9554.82] Um, but, but you could use that to show a visual level of importance.
[9554.82 → 9558.92] If you, if you're like having a hard time putting number values to things, you can effectively
[9558.92 → 9564.72] do that on a visual grid by having importance below and then something else be left to right.
[9564.72 → 9566.82] And then visually see how things kind of come up.
[9566.82 → 9568.62] But I don't know.
[9569.12 → 9573.02] I don't suffer from this as much unless it's purchasing decisions.
[9573.02 → 9574.32] And then I suffer from it brutally.
[9574.32 → 9575.12] This is amazing.
[9575.52 → 9577.92] VNG supernova and float plane chat.
[9577.92 → 9580.12] Um, just flagged this for me.
[9581.22 → 9582.32] The backlogged.
[9583.32 → 9585.32] You have the games, play them.
[9585.32 → 9590.42] See every game you own in one place, customized, custom entries support every game, retro to
[9590.42 → 9594.62] modern, famous to obscure, customize the look of your profile, track your progress and beat
[9594.62 → 9595.42] your backlog.
[9595.42 → 9601.52] So you just enter a list of, uh, according to VNG supernova, you can use it to pick a random
[9601.52 → 9603.82] game from your backlog based on criteria you set.
[9603.82 → 9604.82] Huh.
[9604.82 → 9605.82] Yeah.
[9605.82 → 9606.72] That's pretty sweet.
[9606.72 → 9607.72] I've never heard of this before.
[9607.72 → 9608.72] That seems cool.
[9608.72 → 9609.62] Oh yeah.
[9609.62 → 9611.62] I could see how this would be great for streaming.
[9611.62 → 9612.62] Yeah.
[9612.62 → 9613.62] Yeah.
[9613.62 → 9616.72] I'm sure if I was into Twitch or something, I might've seen it before, but I never have.
[9616.72 → 9617.72] Seems.
[9617.72 → 9618.22] That's pretty cool.
[9618.22 → 9619.22] Seems smart.
[9619.22 → 9620.22] I think it depends.
[9620.22 → 9626.22] Um, I mean, at a, at a, at a gathering, it's less that I don't like talking about my career.
[9626.22 → 9627.22] Like I, I, I'll talk about work the same way anyone will.
[9627.22 → 9628.22] And I'll ask people questions about their work.
[9628.22 → 9629.22] What I don't like is people fawning over it.
[9629.22 → 9630.22] Um, I would just like to be there.
[9630.22 → 9631.22] Um, I would just like to be there.
[9631.22 → 9632.22] Just have a conversation.
[9632.22 → 9634.22] Um, and it makes me really uncomfortable when I feel like I am not just, um, I'm not just,
[9634.22 → 9639.22] um, I'm not just, um, I'm not just, um, I'm not just like to be there.
[9639.22 → 9640.22] I'm not just like to be there.
[9640.22 → 9641.22] I'm not just like to be there.
[9641.22 → 9642.22] Um, I would just like to be there.
[9642.22 → 9643.22] Just have a conversation.
[9643.22 → 9644.22] I'm not just like to be there.
[9644.22 → 9645.22] I'm not just like to be there.
[9645.22 → 9646.22] I'm not just like to be there.
[9646.22 → 9648.22] I'm not just like to be there.
[9648.22 → 9653.22] Um, I would just like to be there as just have a conversation, another parent of one of
[9653.22 → 9655.22] the children at this party.
[9655.22 → 9662.22] Um, and it makes me really uncomfortable when I feel like I am not just, um, with other
[9662.22 → 9665.22] parents, you know, like I'm not, I'm not in YouTuber mode.
[9665.22 → 9666.22] I'm not at LTX.
[9666.22 → 9670.22] I'm not signing things like it's, uh, like I would just like to be able to turn that part
[9670.22 → 9674.22] of my brain off and just have a conversation with another person.
[9674.22 → 9675.22] Just, just, you know, just be normal.
[9675.22 → 9676.22] Right.
[9676.22 → 9680.22] Um, so that, that was going to effectively be my answer for the second part as well.
[9680.22 → 9682.22] When having conversations about random tech stuff.
[9682.22 → 9683.22] Yeah.
[9683.22 → 9686.22] Just talk to me like you would anyone else, and we'll have a good conversation.
[9686.22 → 9687.22] Yeah.
[9687.22 → 9692.22] But when suddenly like you're, you're effectively trying to like watch WAN show, and you're the
[9692.22 → 9695.22] only commenter, it's like, yeah, this is not great.
[9695.22 → 9698.22] Like I'm down to have a conversation with you.
[9698.22 → 9699.22] That's totally cool.
[9699.22 → 9703.22] But I don't want to like present, you know, I don't, I don't know.
[9703.22 → 9706.22] It's, I, it's, it's fairly subtle, but it's important in my opinion.
[9706.22 → 9708.22] The other thing is just read the room, right?
[9708.22 → 9712.22] Like I, um, I've, I've, it's not like I haven't seen some of the recent criticism that's
[9712.22 → 9713.22] come out around me.
[9713.22 → 9717.22] I've seen some people say that I was, you know, very aloof or dismissive at an event
[9717.22 → 9718.22] or something like that.
[9718.22 → 9721.22] And the only real feedback I have for that is, was I working?
[9721.22 → 9723.22] Were you interrupting?
[9723.22 → 9726.22] Was I literally in the middle of a take or something like that?
[9726.22 → 9731.22] Because yeah, I will, I will, I will, I will tell people, I'm sorry.
[9731.22 → 9736.22] I can't talk right now when I am, when I am sitting in a booth writing a script.
[9736.22 → 9737.22] I'm sorry.
[9737.22 → 9739.22] I can't, I, I'm sorry.
[9739.22 → 9743.22] I can't have a 10-minute conversation with you right now because at pretty much every
[9743.22 → 9750.22] point in my career, I have been either fighting for survival or fighting to grow the company
[9750.22 → 9753.22] and support the team or, or whatever else it is.
[9753.22 → 9760.22] And when you're, when you're, when you're trying to, you know, go into particularly an event,
[9760.22 → 9762.22] cause that's, that's some of the feedback that I saw.
[9762.22 → 9767.22] Um, if, if you want to have any hope of extracting the kind of value that you need for the cost that
[9767.22 → 9771.22] it, that is associated with attending these things, you're going pretty hard.
[9771.22 → 9779.22] And there's so much stuff there in some cases that you've got to, you've got, it's intense to try to cover it all.
[9779.22 → 9784.22] And then honestly, the worst problem is when there's nothing, and you're trying to,
[9784.22 → 9785.22] Yeah.
[9785.22 → 9786.22] Trying to extract something.
[9786.22 → 9787.22] Something out of nothing.
[9787.22 → 9795.22] And, and I feel like over the years, I, I've had a lot of encounters with people where they are sort of oblivious to that
[9795.22 → 9798.22] and don't realize that I am not there to socialize.
[9798.22 → 9805.22] And, you know, maybe, maybe part of it is just that, yeah, I'm very, I tend to be a very work focused person.
[9805.22 → 9807.22] I don't have much of a social life.
[9807.22 → 9812.22] Um, I don't necessarily always pick up on obvious social cues.
[9812.22 → 9814.22] You guys may be able to relate.
[9814.22 → 9821.22] And, and, no, I don't, I don't have time to have a long conversation when I'm working.
[9821.22 → 9833.22] Um, especially when I'm somewhere where every, what you might not understand is that three steps ago, somebody else interrupted me.
[9833.22 → 9836.22] And five steps before that, somebody interrupted me.
[9836.22 → 9847.22] And, you know, I, I'm trying to be nice, but I also have a job to do because if I don't do it, then I'm just going to walk out of here having done absolutely nothing.
[9847.22 → 9849.22] And so it's, um, yeah, it's tough.
[9849.22 → 9854.22] I don't really, I don't, I don't really know what to say about that other than, uh, sorry.
[9854.22 → 9859.22] Um, you know, maybe, maybe catch me at like a party next time.
[9859.22 → 9861.22] Although that'll be tough.
[9861.22 → 9865.22] I, I used to try to make appearances, but then I just, I really don't like them.
[9865.22 → 9868.22] I go to a maximum of one per show these days.
[9868.22 → 9869.22] And even then that's rare.
[9869.22 → 9870.22] And I will usually leave early.
[9870.22 → 9871.22] I don't like them.
[9871.22 → 9875.22] You know, what's really the you know what the most frustrating part of them is for me.
[9876.22 → 9877.22] It's that the music's too loud.
[9877.22 → 9878.22] I, okay.
[9879.22 → 9888.22] The reason why I leave early is because I, I will usually try to collect some people that I want to talk to and then ask everyone if we can all leave so we can actually have a conversation.
[9888.22 → 9893.22] Cause if I'm there for an hour or more, I will lose my voice.
[9893.22 → 9897.22] One hundred percent trying to yell over the stupid music and the best venues.
[9897.22 → 9904.22] The only ones that I've stayed at are when, if there's music, it's really quiet, and it's just like a hangout space.
[9904.22 → 9905.22] Yeah.
[9905.22 → 9906.22] Those are awesome.
[9906.22 → 9907.22] Almost never happens.
[9907.22 → 9911.22] But it's always like a bar or a club or something, and they have music slamming, and it's so annoying.
[9911.22 → 9919.22] Which I don't understand because particularly in the tech industry, the first thing everybody says, the second they walk up to you is like, man, the music is way too loud.
[9919.22 → 9920.22] I can't hear you.
[9920.22 → 9921.22] I can't hear you.
[9921.22 → 9924.22] And then you complain, and you say, Hey, turn it down.
[9924.22 → 9928.22] And then they do for like, they turn it down like a fraction of a thing.
[9928.22 → 9930.22] And then you can tell they like, turn it back up after a couple of minutes.
[9930.22 → 9931.22] It's like, can you stop?
[9931.22 → 9933.22] Can you just actually not do that?
[9933.22 → 9936.22] Where this is a professional function, and I'm trying to talk to people.
[9936.22 → 9938.22] And we're all trying to not get sick.
[9938.22 → 9944.22] Meanwhile, I'm like leaning into people like this while they're trying to talk so I can hear them.
[9944.22 → 9945.22] Yeah.
[9945.22 → 9946.22] And they're doing the same thing for me.
[9946.22 → 9949.22] And it's like, man, this is just, it's so dumb.
[9949.22 → 9951.22] I hate that stuff so much.
[9951.22 → 9952.22] Yeah.
[9952.22 → 9955.22] Night pause and float plan chat says, yeah, I don't know anyone that likes it.
[9955.22 → 9957.22] It's, it's bizarre to me.
[9957.22 → 9962.22] We had a pool party at my place a little while ago, and I was playing around with the, with the levels on everything.
[9962.22 → 9966.22] And basically what I aimed for was I can tell there's music on.
[9966.22 → 9967.22] Yeah.
[9967.22 → 9971.22] The idea was that if there's an awkward pause, there's music.
[9971.22 → 9975.22] And if people are talking, you don't really, really notice it anymore.
[9975.22 → 9976.22] Yeah.
[9976.22 → 9977.22] Yeah.
[9977.22 → 9978.22] That sounds perfect.
[9978.22 → 9979.22] I was like, yes, go Linus.
[9979.22 → 9981.22] And I never had an issue talking to anyone.
[9981.22 → 9982.22] So that was great.
[9982.22 → 9983.22] So frustrating.
[9983.22 → 9984.22] Yeah.
[9984.22 → 9987.22] What was even the merge message that started this?
[9987.22 → 9989.22] Should we stay on topic?
[9989.22 → 9990.22] I don't know.
[9990.22 → 9991.22] I don't remember.
[9991.22 → 9992.22] Up next.
[9992.22 → 9993.22] DLL.
[9993.22 → 9997.22] In the golden days, goods and services were paid for with the trading of goats.
[9997.22 → 10000.22] How many goats would you say you are each worth and why?
[10000.22 → 10003.22] Thank you for feeding my pin obsession.
[10004.22 → 10006.22] How, how, wow.
[10006.22 → 10008.22] We're getting into the worth of a person now?
[10008.22 → 10009.22] How many goats am I worth?
[10009.22 → 10011.22] I mean, I, I would.
[10011.22 → 10013.22] How many goats per hour?
[10013.22 → 10018.22] I was about to say, I think any human is worth almost a limitless number of goats.
[10018.22 → 10022.22] But then if you were to tell me, look, I'm going to slaughter 10 million goats
[10022.22 → 10023.22] for this one person.
[10023.22 → 10027.22] I'd be like, wow, that does really seem like a lot of goats.
[10027.22 → 10029.22] Um, you know what?
[10029.22 → 10031.22] I'm going to fall back on one of my classics.
[10031.22 → 10036.22] I, I define the value of pretty much anything in terms of human life.
[10036.22 → 10044.22] So we can actually do the math on this because to raise a goat, to care for it and feed it
[10044.22 → 10049.22] and give it water, um, does cost some human life.
[10049.22 → 10056.22] So I would say that the worth of the worth of a one person is how much reasonable remaining
[10056.22 → 10065.22] life expectancy they have divided by the, the, the, the, um, the number of hours of care required
[10065.22 → 10070.22] to raise the number of goats or whatever you guys get what I'm saying, right?
[10070.22 → 10075.22] So the, the equivalent amount of, of goat raising time for someone else, right?
[10075.22 → 10082.22] Like to me, to me, the, the, the problem with stealing from someone is that you are stealing their money,
[10082.22 → 10084.22] which equals time, which equals their life.
[10084.22 → 10088.22] You're stealing someone's life by, by, by taking something that they worked and they earned.
[10088.22 → 10096.22] And so, um, you know, in the same way by slaughtering a goat, you are slaughtering the effort of that person who raised it.
[10096.22 → 10099.22] And, um, that's what I'm going with.
[10099.22 → 10106.22] I'm stealing a comment from float plane chat and reworking it a little bit, but I'm going to say you're worth one goat.
[10106.22 → 10110.22] One goat because, because, because, because you're the goat.
[10110.22 → 10111.22] That's stupid.
[10111.22 → 10116.22] I like, I knew you were going there, but it's one of those things that I can't even, I can't even beat you to the punchline
[10116.22 → 10118.22] because I don't want to be the one to say that.
[10118.22 → 10120.22] I knew that too.
[10120.22 → 10128.22] He looked at me in a certain way and then looked down because he knew what I was going to say, but he was stuck.
[10128.22 → 10131.22] Because if he guesses that, and then it's something else.
[10135.22 → 10136.22] F***ING a**.
[10136.22 → 10137.22] Oh, that was awesome.
[10137.22 → 10139.22] You guys are on your own. Goodbye.
[10139.22 → 10141.22] Okay.
[10141.22 → 10142.22] That was great.
[10142.22 → 10143.22] Thanks, Dan.
[10143.22 → 10147.22] I'm sure that was much more fun for me than anyone else.
[10147.22 → 10149.22] Where's the prism now?
[10149.22 → 10150.22] I really enjoyed that.
[10150.22 → 10151.22] Awful man.
[10151.22 → 10152.22] Aw, man.
[10152.22 → 10153.22] Okay.
[10153.22 → 10158.22] What's the process like for designing and choosing new pins to put out?
[10158.22 → 10160.22] Oh, man.
[10160.22 → 10171.22] Usually it's me, Sarah, and Nick kind of brainstorming stuff we think is cool, stuff we think is memeable, stuff we think is pretty.
[10171.22 → 10173.22] We have, okay, I'm going to spoil it.
[10173.22 → 10177.22] We have a really cool series coming out called Dead Pixel.
[10177.22 → 10178.22] Oh.
[10178.22 → 10179.22] It's just a monitor.
[10179.22 → 10181.22] It just like has a dead pixel on it.
[10181.22 → 10183.22] Oh, my God.
[10184.22 → 10186.22] It's going to be like a whole collection.
[10186.22 → 10187.22] Wow.
[10187.22 → 10188.22] Don't worry about it.
[10188.22 → 10193.22] So it's like the it's like the I bought this product just to bother you collection.
[10193.22 → 10199.22] Yeah, I was just going to say, for people that that doesn't bother, if they have friends that that bothers, that's going to be such a way to troll.
[10199.22 → 10201.22] That's really exciting.
[10201.22 → 10202.22] I like that a lot.
[10202.22 → 10206.22] We have one that's just a dead pixel, so you can just put it on stuff.
[10206.22 → 10207.22] Wow.
[10207.22 → 10209.22] Hey, LLD.
[10209.22 → 10213.22] I'm being called a psycho.
[10213.22 → 10214.22] You know what?
[10214.22 → 10215.22] I don't think it was actually my idea.
[10215.22 → 10216.22] I think it might have been Sarah's idea.
[10216.22 → 10217.22] We all knew this.
[10217.22 → 10218.22] Hey, LLD.
[10218.22 → 10221.22] Any updates on the Noctua edition screwdriver?
[10221.22 → 10222.22] Also, any future plans to bundle the normal and stubby screwdrivers?
[10222.22 → 10223.22] I got a lot of merch messages about this, so I thought I'd curate one of them.
[10223.22 → 10224.22] Oh, a bundle.
[10224.22 → 10226.22] It didn't even occur to me to be perfectly honest with you.
[10226.22 → 10243.22] Yeah, I could see us doing something like that in the future, but maybe not for a while.
[10243.22 → 10246.22] The thing with pricing is it's, there are lots of different ways to do it.
[10246.22 → 10249.22] You can do it by what the market will bear.
[10249.22 → 10252.22] You can do it by cost plus percentage.
[10252.22 → 10257.22] You can do it by, I mean, yeah, I guess those are kind of the biggest ways.
[10257.22 → 10262.22] But for, you know, a lot of companies, one of the factors that they will consider is not
[10262.22 → 10264.22] f***ING with your customers.
[10264.22 → 10272.22] So anyone who bought the stubby and the regular one at full price is going to expect that the
[10272.22 → 10277.22] next day after the launch, there isn't a promo where they could have gotten a better deal on it.
[10277.22 → 10278.22] So it'll be a little while.
[10278.22 → 10281.22] Stubby is selling really well at the price that it's at.
[10281.22 → 10286.22] And, you know, we need to make sure that we're keeping up with production and everything.
[10286.22 → 10289.22] But I could see something like that happening at some point in the future.
[10289.22 → 10290.22] That's a cool idea.
[10290.22 → 10293.22] I'm not given a timeline for this at all, though.
[10293.22 → 10299.22] Oh, as for the Noctua edition, I don't know, sometime late this year, early next, I think.
[10299.22 → 10308.22] I think RetroD river is going to be the first sort of regular priced new colourway that comes.
[10308.22 → 10311.22] Actually, I don't know what the pricing is going to be yet.
[10311.22 → 10313.22] I don't know what volumes we're producing.
[10313.22 → 10316.22] So that's a big impact on pricing.
[10316.22 → 10318.22] No, that's not the one.
[10318.22 → 10319.22] No, that's not the one.
[10319.22 → 10320.22] Hold on.
[10320.22 → 10322.22] There's one in here that is definitely the one.
[10322.22 → 10323.22] Seriously?
[10323.22 → 10324.22] How many screwdrivers do I have in my backpack right now?
[10324.22 → 10325.22] Ah, this one.
[10325.22 → 10326.22] Nope.
[10326.22 → 10327.22] Dang it.
[10327.22 → 10328.22] There it is.
[10328.22 → 10329.22] There it is.
[10329.22 → 10332.22] The RetroD river is coming very soon.
[10332.22 → 10334.22] I'm just going to switch to the Linus cam.
[10334.22 → 10337.22] Hopefully, sometime in the next...
[10337.22 → 10338.22] You know what?
[10338.22 → 10339.22] I'm not going to promise anything.
[10339.22 → 10340.22] I don't want to get it wrong.
[10340.22 → 10343.22] But yeah, I freaking love this one.
[10343.22 → 10346.22] As a kid who played retro games...
[10346.22 → 10347.22] Yeah.
[10348.22 → 10349.22] That's a SNES.
[10349.22 → 10350.22] No, that's a SNES!
[10350.22 → 10351.22] Stop!
[10351.22 → 10352.22] No, it's not.
[10352.22 → 10354.22] Sorry, there's one on the wall behind him.
[10354.22 → 10356.22] There is one over there that he was talking about.
[10356.22 → 10357.22] Yep.
[10357.22 → 10358.22] What in the world could that be?
[10358.22 → 10359.22] Um...
[10359.22 → 10360.22] Yeah, so this is a cool screwdriver.
[10360.22 → 10362.22] It's the Retro screwdriver.
[10362.22 → 10363.22] Yeah.
[10363.22 → 10365.22] Sorry, it was just in front of the...
[10365.22 → 10366.22] Yeah, anyway.
[10366.22 → 10367.22] Yeah.
[10367.22 → 10368.22] Yeah.
[10368.22 → 10370.22] Someone in Flow plane chat said,
[10370.22 → 10373.22] get brand to make a dead pixel screen protector.
[10373.22 → 10376.22] You could put on other people's phones.
[10376.22 → 10377.22] Oh!
[10377.22 → 10378.22] You're a bad man.
[10384.22 → 10386.22] Now that it's been said, it's an inevitability.
[10386.22 → 10387.22] Oh, man.
[10387.22 → 10388.22] Oh, man.
[10388.22 → 10389.22] Okay.
[10389.22 → 10390.22] Up next.
[10390.22 → 10391.22] Let's see.
[10391.22 → 10392.22] Hey, LLD.
[10392.22 → 10397.22] How have the first few weeks under the slower video output workflow been?
[10397.22 → 10398.22] P.S.
[10398.22 → 10401.22] Can't wait to get my hands on the stubby.
[10401.22 → 10405.22] I'll take this one since Luke doesn't really work on that many videos.
[10405.22 → 10407.22] It's been a bit of a mixed bag.
[10407.22 → 10415.22] Um, I think there's been some really sort of funny stuff, like times when I'm the one saying,
[10415.22 → 10420.22] hey, this needs to be pushed or hey, this needs to be cancelled, and other people are just in old habits.
[10420.22 → 10424.22] Um, which is like, really?
[10424.22 → 10425.22] Um, okay.
[10425.22 → 10426.22] Yeah.
[10426.22 → 10435.22] Um, it's been, in some cases frustrating because, you know, on the one hand, yeah, we spent a week sort of working on a lot of our communication.
[10435.22 → 10441.22] And, um, you know, we may, I think we learned a lot, but on the other hand, you know, we're still finding a lot of challenges.
[10441.22 → 10442.22] We're still finding a lot of problems.
[10442.22 → 10453.22] Like there's, there are videos that, um, even though we are taking more time, we are still running into, it's a lot of moving pieces.
[10453.22 → 10463.22] Like this is something I think a lot of people don't necessarily understand is every video has at least, you know, five people involved in it.
[10463.22 → 10465.22] And it's not always the same five people.
[10465.22 → 10473.22] And so, you know, what works really well with, with, you know, one team might not work as well when one or two of those team members are swapped out, and it's, it's kind of constant.
[10473.22 → 10482.22] Right. And, um, so we're still finding a lot of, a lot of challenges that are nothing to do with time and just everything to do with process and communication.
[10482.22 → 10483.22] We're going to keep working on it.
[10483.22 → 10490.22] And, uh, you know, I'm really, I'm actually really happy with the videos that we have released post break.
[10490.22 → 10497.22] Uh, one thing that's new, um, effective, let me just have a look here.
[10497.22 → 10503.22] I just want to see which video it started with.
[10503.22 → 10512.22] Effective, uh, Radeon 7700 7800 XT video.
[10512.22 → 10524.22] Um, I will be doing a brutal QC pass on every single LTT, which, uh, I don't know, maybe, maybe I should have been doing all along.
[10524.22 → 10526.22] I haven't had time.
[10526.22 → 10529.22] So that's something that I'm going to have to figure out.
[10529.22 → 10538.22] Hopefully it will be something that I can do in the long-term with the time that I would have been doing like executive management things that I don't really want to do anymore.
[10538.22 → 10541.22] And I think Taryn and the rest of the exec team should be doing.
[10541.22 → 10543.22] And, you know, so we can get back to our daily upload cadence.
[10543.22 → 10546.22] I, I think that is still a goal we'd like to achieve in the long-term.
[10546.22 → 10556.22] Um, so hopefully, hopefully it's something that I, I can, I can continue to do or, or that I don't need to do at some point if we, if we get people kind of trained up.
[10556.22 → 10570.22] But I, um, one of the videos that is in the short term, probably coming up on Sunday, but, uh, if the, if the ECC squad finds any, um, any severe problems with it, we'll be pushed to next week.
[10570.22 → 10578.22] Um, I went through, and I did an absolutely savage passive, and it went from 24 minutes to 20 minutes.
[10578.22 → 10596.22] And so I think that something you guys can look forward to us, as I go through and just brutally axe things from videos is that you're going to see a, a lot less B material in the videos and B maybe a lot more like float plane exclusives and stuff.
[10596.22 → 10598.22] Um, a lot, a lot more cutting, cutting room floor.
[10598.22 → 10606.22] That's like kind of fine and would have been, you know, a material that ended up in a YouTube video before, but now is just cut.
[10606.22 → 10607.22] Yeah.
[10607.22 → 10608.22] Gets the cut.
[10608.22 → 10611.22] Good evening, LLD.
[10611.22 → 10613.22] Those are my wife's initials.
[10613.22 → 10616.22] Linus, what's your darn tough sock poison?
[10616.22 → 10617.22] Cushioned or uncushioned?
[10617.22 → 10618.22] Ultra light?
[10618.22 → 10619.22] Light?
[10619.22 → 10620.22] Mid?
[10620.22 → 10621.22] Heavy?
[10621.22 → 10622.22] And what height?
[10622.22 → 10625.22] Uh, well, I'm wearing them now, so that'll be easy.
[10625.22 → 10626.22] This one.
[10626.22 → 10627.22] Hold on, there, there, there, there, that height.
[10627.22 → 10628.22] That one.
[10628.22 → 10629.22] That's a surprisingly effective way to communicate that.
[10629.22 → 10630.22] I wear these socks.
[10630.22 → 10631.22] Love it.
[10631.22 → 10646.22] Hello LL and D. Love the show, love the merch.
[10646.22 → 10649.22] Linus, what happened with the stray cat you found in your yard?
[10649.22 → 10652.22] You mean the stray cats that live with me now?
[10652.22 → 10654.22] I curated this one for you.
[10654.22 → 10655.22] Yeah.
[10655.22 → 10658.22] Um, their names are Brownie and Noodle.
[10658.22 → 10663.22] Um, so named because they are brown and a noodle.
[10663.22 → 10669.22] So, Noodle has the he does this thing where, you know how cats like curl up their legs under them?
[10669.22 → 10674.22] Well, Noodle does that, but he also does a thing where he just splays out every single leg.
[10674.22 → 10676.22] Um, particularly when he's feeling shy.
[10676.22 → 10678.22] So he did that a lot when we first adopted him.
[10678.22 → 10683.22] Um, yeah, they're, they're doing great.
[10683.22 → 10689.22] They, they are not as socialized as a cat that, as a very, very small kitten, had a ton of human interaction.
[10689.22 → 10692.22] But they get better all the time.
[10692.22 → 10697.22] And they are at the point now where particularly at certain times of day, you know how cats are.
[10697.22 → 10702.22] Um, they genuinely like and seek out human interaction.
[10702.22 → 10705.22] So, um, we're, we're, we're really glad we adopted them.
[10705.22 → 10707.22] They are cats.
[10707.22 → 10713.22] So, you know, they tear up the carpet and just do cat things because, you know, f**k you, right?
[10713.22 → 10714.22] Because they're cats.
[10714.22 → 10717.22] Um, but we're, we're, we're, we're happy.
[10717.22 → 10723.22] And, and Dash ultimately has gotten to a point where she'll tolerate them.
[10723.22 → 10732.22] She's not nearly, she's not as happy as she was when she was an only cat, but she's not nearly as stressed as she was when she lived with her brother, actually.
[10732.22 → 10736.22] So they, they've reached peace, at least.
[10736.22 → 10738.22] She was super unimpressed at the start.
[10738.22 → 10739.22] Oh yeah, I remember that.
[10739.22 → 10741.22] But yeah, she was not, she was not into it.
[10741.22 → 10746.22] Um, but now, now she's, she's, she would never like to groom them or anything, but she doesn't hiss at them all the time either.
[10746.22 → 10748.22] So yeah, we're good.
[10748.22 → 10757.22] Hey, DLL, what would it take for all three of you to shave your beards or just one of you?
[10757.22 → 10760.22] Hmm.
[10760.22 → 10763.22] It has to be a lot.
[10763.22 → 10768.22] I thought I could get you to do it.
[10768.22 → 10771.22] What if I like, uh, you know what?
[10771.22 → 10773.22] Yeah, I could, I could, I could probably get you to do it.
[10774.22 → 10776.22] I just, I'd like play on your feelings or something.
[10776.22 → 10780.22] I would be like, yeah, I'm going to shave mine and donate to something.
[10780.22 → 10782.22] And if you do yours too, then I'll double it or something like that.
[10782.22 → 10783.22] Oh yeah.
[10783.22 → 10786.22] I thought you were talking, uh, just me.
[10786.22 → 10788.22] I think just me would be pretty hard.
[10788.22 → 10790.22] I think me joining the group would not be that hard.
[10790.22 → 10791.22] Yeah.
[10791.22 → 10792.22] See that's the thing.
[10792.22 → 10795.22] If I did it with you, and it was for a good cause, like Luke's in, it's easy.
[10795.22 → 10796.22] Yeah.
[10796.22 → 10797.22] It's easy.
[10797.22 → 10800.22] Um, I was actually really close to doing it a couple of weeks ago.
[10800.22 → 10801.22] Yep.
[10801.22 → 10803.22] As just, as just like, I actually thought it was happening.
[10803.22 → 10804.22] No.
[10804.22 → 10805.22] Yeah.
[10805.22 → 10806.22] It's a, I don't know.
[10806.22 → 10810.22] I think it would have, I thought about it as like, kind of like a new leaf thing.
[10810.22 → 10811.22] Yeah.
[10811.22 → 10815.22] Like a, like a new era where we're, we're, we're changing a lot of things up.
[10815.22 → 10816.22] So I'm just going to like to shave the beard.
[10816.22 → 10820.22] But then I thought about it some more, and I was like, that doesn't actually mean anything.
[10820.22 → 10826.22] And so to me, it feels kind of cheap, even if other people thought it was, you know, symbolic and cool.
[10826.22 → 10830.22] So I just, I decided, I just thought it was kind of a cheap stunt.
[10830.22 → 10831.22] So forget it.
[10831.22 → 10832.22] Yeah.
[10832.22 → 10837.22] Um, I just, I don't know if the wife tells me to shave it, it's gone.
[10837.22 → 10839.22] And if she tells me to keep it, it's here to stay for me.
[10839.22 → 10840.22] It's that simple.
[10840.22 → 10843.22] That's kind of where I've been and Emma likes the beard.
[10843.22 → 10846.22] So yeah.
[10846.22 → 10847.22] Yeah.
[10847.22 → 10851.22] And honestly, I would not want to upkeep non beard.
[10851.22 → 10852.22] Yeah.
[10852.22 → 10854.22] Not shaving every day is like kind of great.
[10854.22 → 10855.22] It's nice.
[10855.22 → 10859.22] I trim it like once a week, and sometimes I forget, and I do it in two weeks, and it's like, okay,
[10859.22 → 10860.22] it's fine.
[10860.22 → 10862.22] Just, it just covers the like bear patches better.
[10862.22 → 10863.22] Okay.
[10863.22 → 10864.22] Yeah.
[10864.22 → 10865.22] Yeah.
[10865.22 → 10866.22] It's kind of whatever.
[10866.22 → 10867.22] Right.
[10867.22 → 10868.22] I don't know.
[10868.22 → 10873.22] I've been watching you all for a decade, and I've seen myself going from a PC building
[10873.22 → 10876.22] noob to wizard who advises friends on building.
[10876.22 → 10879.22] When did you guys realize you had that expertise?
[10879.22 → 10884.22] I think expertise is a strong word to describe building computers.
[10884.22 → 10885.22] I don't know.
[10885.22 → 10891.22] I've, um, I've ended up in, I wouldn't say heated conversations, but certainly disagreements
[10891.22 → 10892.22] over this in the past.
[10892.22 → 10899.22] I remember talking to someone from a boutique system integrator who referred to the people
[10899.22 → 10905.22] who, like the, the team that designed their systems as engineers.
[10905.22 → 10910.22] And I was like, you guys assemble computers.
[10910.22 → 10917.22] Um, like to be clear, like I'm not, not dissing anyone who does actual engineering.
[10917.22 → 10919.22] Like they weren't designing their own cases.
[10919.22 → 10924.22] They, they were just picking off the shelf parts and building computers.
[10924.22 → 10932.22] Um, they were, they were not happy that I told them I didn't agree with that.
[10932.22 → 10937.22] And, um, that was kind of where we left it, I guess, because I wasn't really going to back
[10937.22 → 10938.22] down on that.
[10938.22 → 10939.22] That's not engineering.
[10939.22 → 10940.22] Yeah.
[10940.22 → 10941.22] From, I don't think it was a major moment for you.
[10941.22 → 10943.22] It was just something that I happened to be passionate about.
[10943.22 → 10945.22] Like a lot of my friends were into technology.
[10946.22 → 10951.22] I just happened to be more focused on the PC side of things.
[10951.22 → 10953.22] So I would be happy to help.
[10953.22 → 10956.22] It was a way to do odd jobs and make money to support my gaming habit.
[10956.22 → 10957.22] Yeah, absolutely.
[10957.22 → 10958.22] So that, that's something.
[10958.22 → 10961.22] Um, I just, I just hate, I hate waste.
[10961.22 → 10962.22] I hate seeing people waste money.
[10962.22 → 10963.22] Yeah.
[10963.22 → 10966.22] And so I would, you know, I want to learn about it and advise.
[10966.22 → 10969.22] I want to play cool games with my friends.
[10969.22 → 10974.22] And sometimes if it was PC games that kind of required them to have a cool PC.
[10974.22 → 10977.22] So I just tried to make sure they did too.
[10977.22 → 10978.22] I don't know.
[10978.22 → 10979.22] Whatever.
[10981.22 → 10986.22] Hey DLL, now that both of the screwdrivers and backpack are released with the cable management
[10986.22 → 10988.22] coming soon, what's next?
[10988.22 → 10989.22] Any teasers?
[10989.22 → 10990.22] Can't wait for the cat bed.
[10990.22 → 10993.22] Yeah, we have a precision driver, um, coming.
[10993.22 → 10998.22] We have, um, oh, have we talked about precision?
[10998.22 → 11000.22] Have we talked about the fail pen?
[11001.22 → 11002.22] Only a little.
[11002.22 → 11003.22] On the WAN show?
[11003.22 → 11004.22] Uh, yes.
[11004.22 → 11005.22] A couple of times.
[11005.22 → 11006.22] Oh, all right.
[11006.22 → 11007.22] Well, we have the fail pen coming.
[11007.22 → 11009.22] Uh, it's really cool.
[11009.22 → 11011.22] I haven't seen it ever.
[11011.22 → 11015.22] Oh, it started out like, yep, that's made out of a screwdriver shaft.
[11015.22 → 11019.22] Um, and now the fail pen is like, wow, that's a really nice pen.
[11019.22 → 11021.22] I can't believe this is made out of a screwdriver shaft.
[11021.22 → 11028.22] It's, yeah, it's, the team is doing a really, perfect job of, uh, pushing that product
[11028.22 → 11029.22] along.
[11029.22 → 11031.22] I'm, I'm pretty, I'm pretty excited for it.
[11031.22 → 11032.22] Um.
[11032.22 → 11033.22] Um.
[11033.22 → 11036.22] Did they tell you about the, uh, the chess problem that they ran into with it?
[11036.22 → 11037.22] The chess problem.
[11037.22 → 11039.22] Yeah, engineering chess problem.
[11039.22 → 11041.22] Like kings, queens, bishops, chess?
[11041.22 → 11042.22] Yeah, but like a puzzle.
[11042.22 → 11043.22] This, this drove me nuts.
[11043.22 → 11045.22] I never knew this was called the chess problem.
[11045.22 → 11046.22] Okay, hit me.
[11046.22 → 11048.22] And I, I overheard Dan talking about it, and I was like.
[11048.22 → 11051.22] It's all, and any of us can think about it.
[11051.22 → 11053.22] So it has that J on the backside of it, right?
[11053.22 → 11057.22] Where you, uh, where you kind of flick the, the locking mechanism.
[11057.22 → 11058.22] Machining that in the real.
[11058.22 → 11059.22] The bolt action.
[11059.22 → 11060.22] Yeah, bolt action.
[11060.22 → 11063.22] Machining that in the real world, absolutely trivial.
[11063.22 → 11068.22] Modelling that in SolidWorks has stumped your entire engineering team.
[11068.22 → 11073.22] Myself, a friend of mine who's a manufacturing engineer, and now his friends.
[11073.22 → 11079.22] This, this little tiny problem of how to properly 3D model a J is going around our engineering circles.
[11079.22 → 11082.22] Can we just paint it with matte paint and then scan it?
[11082.22 → 11083.22] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[11083.22 → 11085.22] So making it super easy.
[11085.22 → 11090.22] Programming it to be visually exact how it comes across in the real world is like.
[11090.22 → 11092.22] No, but that's what I'm asking.
[11092.22 → 11094.22] I'm asking, can we just manufacture it and then scan it?
[11094.22 → 11095.22] No, no, no, no.
[11095.22 → 11096.22] Why not?
[11096.22 → 11098.22] Because we know how to do it.
[11098.22 → 11099.22] That's why it's a chess problem.
[11099.22 → 11101.22] It's like a theoretical problem.
[11101.22 → 11103.22] Why does that make sense?
[11103.22 → 11105.22] Why does that make sense?
[11105.22 → 11112.22] So chess problems are like, here is a board state, win in two moves.
[11112.22 → 11114.22] You have to, you have to like complete...
[11114.22 → 11119.22] So what you're saying is that it's unnecessary to solve it because we can manufacture it already?
[11119.22 → 11122.22] Yeah, you can do it, but it's like...
[11122.22 → 11124.22] So why are we spending cycles on this? Hold on a second.
[11124.22 → 11130.22] No, no, no, no. I mean, it's now wasting lots of people's free time because we want to know.
[11130.22 → 11131.22] Because it shouldn't be this difficult.
[11131.22 → 11132.22] I see.
[11132.22 → 11133.22] And it's this difficult, right?
[11133.22 → 11134.22] Okay, but it's their free time.
[11134.22 → 11135.22] Oh yeah, 100% free time.
[11135.22 → 11136.22] Oh, okay, well then, sure.
[11136.22 → 11137.22] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11137.22 → 11138.22] Cool.
[11138.22 → 11139.22] So making that...
[11139.22 → 11141.22] I just don't understand why it's called the chess problem.
[11141.22 → 11144.22] Yeah, you and I have very different concerns about this.
[11144.22 → 11145.22] Yeah.
[11145.22 → 11146.22] Ugh.
[11146.22 → 11147.22] Whatever.
[11147.22 → 11149.22] It's a pen, yay!
[11149.22 → 11151.22] It's a good pen.
[11151.22 → 11156.22] Yeah, and it's made of, it's made of what otherwise would have been wasted, crappy failed, uh,
[11156.22 → 11157.22] screwdriver shafts.
[11157.22 → 11158.22] Which is great.
[11158.22 → 11159.22] Which is great.
[11159.22 → 11160.22] Woo!
[11160.22 → 11161.22] Yeah.
[11161.22 → 11162.22] Okay, next.
[11162.22 → 11165.22] Hey, LLD, I work with CFD at NASA.
[11165.22 → 11170.22] A recurring problem is old Sims that are lost because of software changes.
[11170.22 → 11175.22] What is your most frustrating example of losing work from loss of backwards compatibility?
[11175.22 → 11177.22] Computer fluid dynamics, by the way.
[11177.22 → 11178.22] Um...
[11178.22 → 11181.22] Sigh.
[11185.22 → 11186.22] I don't know.
[11186.22 → 11190.22] I think I find the most interesting example of this is when you go through certain like
[11190.22 → 11194.22] manufacturing shops or, or different places like that, and they'll have some computer...
[11194.22 → 11195.22] Like Windows 95.
[11195.22 → 11196.22] Yeah.
[11196.22 → 11200.22] And it's still chugging along, and it's like, what would you do if this broke?
[11200.22 → 11202.22] And they're just like, don't even want to think about it.
[11202.22 → 11203.22] Not make money.
[11203.22 → 11204.22] Yep.
[11204.22 → 11205.22] It's like, wow.
[11205.22 → 11206.22] Okay.
[11206.22 → 11209.22] Most of what I do is, uh, like text based.
[11209.22 → 11215.22] Like I think, like if you really boil it down, I'm a writer or like a writing editor.
[11215.22 → 11216.22] Right?
[11216.22 → 11222.22] So we've done a pretty good job, I think as a computer industry, um, you know, as, as, as
[11222.22 → 11228.22] humans of making text file formats pretty darn forward and backward compatible.
[11228.22 → 11235.22] So, I have not really experienced a ton of lost work due to backwards compatibility.
[11235.22 → 11239.22] I have experienced lost save games.
[11239.22 → 11240.22] Mm-hmm.
[11240.22 → 11243.22] Due to, you know, games I can no longer play because they're not compatible with the current
[11243.22 → 11244.22] operating system.
[11244.22 → 11249.22] So if I ever wanted to go back and play them, um, you know, that's, that's definitely something
[11249.22 → 11252.22] that I, that I've experienced, but I think that's like kind of the closest thing that
[11252.22 → 11253.22] I would have to that.
[11256.22 → 11257.22] Oh yeah.
[11257.22 → 11259.22] Uh, D doc, a good full plane comment.
[11259.22 → 11260.22] Wow.
[11260.22 → 11261.22] Microsoft's getting rid of word pad.
[11261.22 → 11262.22] Did you know that?
[11262.22 → 11263.22] No.
[11263.22 → 11264.22] Yeah.
[11264.22 → 11265.22] Word pad is going away.
[11265.22 → 11269.22] And I think the next major Windows update, like we're not even getting like a, you know,
[11269.22 → 11271.22] a five-year warning or anything like that.
[11271.22 → 11276.22] Ah, word pad is such a lifesaver when you just need to open a document on a brand new
[11276.22 → 11277.22] computer.
[11277.22 → 11283.22] It otherwise serves absolutely no purpose for me because I pay for Office 365, and I pay for
[11283.22 → 11284.22] Google Docs.
[11284.22 → 11285.22] Go me.
[11285.22 → 11289.22] I spend way too much on word processing software, but it means that I don't need it.
[11289.22 → 11294.22] But man, the people who do need it and the times that they do need it, boy, is it ever
[11294.22 → 11295.22] handy.
[11295.22 → 11296.22] That sucks.
[11297.22 → 11299.22] You just like worked out my computer.
[11299.22 → 11300.22] Oh, sorry.
[11300.22 → 11301.22] It did not like bouncing.
[11301.22 → 11302.22] It's okay.
[11302.22 → 11303.22] It's solved now.
[11304.22 → 11306.22] I'm surprised how much it didn't like that.
[11306.22 → 11308.22] Like notepad, notepad plus.
[11308.22 → 11310.22] What if you don't have an internet connection?
[11310.22 → 11312.22] You can't download it.
[11312.22 → 11318.22] Word pad is the infrequently used, but when used, oh man, I'm happy this happened to be on
[11318.22 → 11319.22] my computer.
[11319.22 → 11320.22] Yeah.
[11320.22 → 11321.22] Because the alternative is notepad.
[11321.22 → 11322.22] Yeah.
[11322.22 → 11325.22] Not notepad plus because for whatever reason you don't have notepad plus yet.
[11325.22 → 11326.22] Yeah.
[11327.22 → 11328.22] Yeah.
[11328.22 → 11329.22] Yeah.
[11329.22 → 11331.22] Wait, you guys pay for Google Docs?
[11332.22 → 11333.22] Yes.
[11333.22 → 11334.22] Yep.
[11334.22 → 11335.22] And teams.
[11335.22 → 11336.22] And teams.
[11336.22 → 11337.22] And slack.
[11337.22 → 11338.22] We know.
[11338.22 → 11339.22] What?
[11339.22 → 11340.22] Oh, for the dev team.
[11340.22 → 11341.22] We don't pay for slack for everybody.
[11341.22 → 11342.22] That's true.
[11342.22 → 11343.22] But for the dev team, we do pay for all three, don't we?
[11343.22 → 11344.22] Well, the local ones.
[11344.22 → 11345.22] Yeah.
[11345.22 → 11346.22] Good gravy.
[11346.22 → 11347.22] Yeah, it's a lot.
[11347.22 → 11348.22] Ugh.
[11348.22 → 11356.22] I recently dropped the LTT screwdriver 130 feet off a small tower.
[11356.22 → 11359.22] It survived short of losing all the bits on the way down.
[11359.22 → 11364.22] Do you have any extra crazy stress testing on your products?
[11364.22 → 11365.22] Okay.
[11365.22 → 11369.22] Do you know about the keycap?
[11369.22 → 11370.22] The keycap statue.
[11370.22 → 11372.22] The keycap statue.
[11372.22 → 11373.22] Keycap statue.
[11373.22 → 11375.22] I totally forgot about the keycap.
[11375.22 → 11376.22] Oh my gosh.
[11376.22 → 11377.22] No.
[11377.22 → 11386.22] So, the problem with the keycap statue, which is a solid aluminum keycap that is like this
[11386.22 → 11392.22] big, is not producing the keycap or polishing the keycap or it being beautiful and something
[11392.22 → 11395.22] people everywhere will need to own.
[11395.22 → 11401.22] The problem is shipping the keycap because it weighs so much, even though it's made of
[11401.22 → 11409.22] aluminum, and is so small that you need to have a box that's like three times its size.
[11409.22 → 11422.22] We also have, we have yielded on our only paper packaging policy for the keycap and the keycap
[11422.22 → 11427.22] alone because from my point of view, if we lose a bunch of these keycaps to damage and
[11427.22 → 11428.22] shipping...
[11428.22 → 11429.22] It's going to be worse.
[11429.22 → 11435.22] We're actually not really doing ourselves any favours here by using paper packing material,
[11435.22 → 11440.22] but getting the packaging right for that has been a real challenge.
[11440.22 → 11444.22] Mostly just communication with packaging manufacturers.
[11444.22 → 11445.22] Like, no.
[11445.22 → 11447.22] Okay, let's try this one more time.
[11447.22 → 11452.22] I need like a solid inch of foam at every corner.
[11452.22 → 11454.22] Nothing else is acceptable.
[11454.22 → 11458.22] They're like, well, what if it was a solid inch on this side and then like a quarter of
[11458.22 → 11459.22] a hundred-inch on that?
[11459.22 → 11460.22] No!
[11460.22 → 11461.22] Ah!
[11461.22 → 11462.22] Okay, no!
[11462.22 → 11464.22] It needs to be this much because this thing weighs a flippin' ton.
[11464.22 → 11468.22] So one of the things that we'll be doing is like hacking it off the roof of the building
[11468.22 → 11472.22] to make sure that when that stupid final packaging arrives, this thing is going to arrive with
[11472.22 → 11473.22] people in one piece.
[11473.22 → 11474.22] But yeah, I'm really excited.
[11474.22 → 11479.22] Don't worry about everyone who's like, oh my goodness, how much is that going to cost?
[11479.22 → 11480.22] I could never afford it.
[11480.22 → 11482.22] The answer is a lot and I know.
[11482.22 → 11483.22] We're going to make a smaller one.
[11483.22 → 11487.22] We'll have like a little cute, like pocketable sized one and then a million.
[11487.22 → 11490.22] A medium one and then like a ridiculous one.
[11490.22 → 11492.22] So you're going to have a keycap?
[11492.22 → 11493.22] No.
[11493.22 → 11495.22] Well, people can already buy those.
[11495.22 → 11496.22] Only keycaps you can't use.
[11496.22 → 11497.22] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11497.22 → 11499.22] Oh, I mean, well, no, no, no, they're completely unusable.
[11499.22 → 11500.22] They're solid.
[11500.22 → 11501.22] Oh, okay.
[11501.22 → 11504.22] Like the entire thing is one giant hunk of polished aluminum.
[11504.22 → 11505.22] Wow.
[11505.22 → 11508.22] Yeah, they're really cool.
[11508.22 → 11509.22] Wow.
[11509.22 → 11512.22] Yeah, like the first thing that Nicholas Pouffe said, keyboard enthusiast.
[11512.22 → 11516.22] Like the kind of person who buys a like a wall mount to put his keyboards on.
[11516.22 → 11521.22] You know, it's like, well, I'll need one.
[11521.22 → 11525.22] Oh, that's great.
[11525.22 → 11526.22] Okay.
[11526.22 → 11527.22] Okay.
[11527.22 → 11528.22] Up next.
[11528.22 → 11530.22] Was there a point that videos weren't scripted?
[11530.22 → 11534.22] If so, when did it feel like it was necessary to write every video?
[11534.22 → 11538.22] Ah, it's been really gradual slash never happened.
[11538.22 → 11546.22] Um, videos weren't scripted at all until, yeah, the first build guide was not scripted.
[11546.22 → 11551.22] So if you go back and watch that, be impressed because I did that all from memory.
[11551.22 → 11552.22] That was really hard.
[11552.22 → 11554.22] Uh, I'm not that good anymore.
[11554.22 → 11556.22] It's, it's, it's a practiced skill.
[11556.22 → 11559.22] Like I, I can't ad lib as well as I used to be able to.
[11559.22 → 11560.22] Oh, I know.
[11560.22 → 11561.22] Yeah.
[11561.22 → 11563.22] Um, like I watched that, and I'm like, dang.
[11563.22 → 11565.22] It was, it's kind of similar though.
[11565.22 → 11570.22] Uh, if you watch some of the early scripted videos, I bet you this kind of suck.
[11570.22 → 11574.22] Cause you slash we are not used to being on Teleprompter yet.
[11574.22 → 11575.22] Yep.
[11575.22 → 11577.22] Whereas now I'm pretty good at it.
[11577.22 → 11580.22] Even you're pretty good at it in spite of the dyslexia.
[11580.22 → 11581.22] Like it's.
[11581.22 → 11583.22] Well, do you know my whole trick?
[11583.22 → 11584.22] I've talked to you about this before, right?
[11584.22 → 11586.22] How I read prompters.
[11586.22 → 11588.22] I think you have, but I think I forget.
[11588.22 → 11592.22] It's like, it's very significantly memory.
[11592.22 → 11594.22] This is why I'll get like, it even happened when we were filming.
[11594.22 → 11595.22] The GPU video.
[11595.22 → 11598.22] I think I said like four words in a row that were wrong.
[11598.22 → 11599.22] And you were like, what?
[11599.22 → 11600.22] And it's like, yeah.
[11600.22 → 11601.22] Because I didn't read them.
[11601.22 → 11603.22] I like thought that's what was there.
[11604.22 → 11609.22] Uh, so I'll, I'll, I'll see like one or two words and then remember what's coming next.
[11609.22 → 11610.22] And then just say it.
[11610.22 → 11613.22] And while I'm saying, I'm trying to refocus on the next one.
[11613.22 → 11616.22] And then I just like kind of crawl through the script from memory.
[11616.22 → 11621.22] That's why I like when game linked gets me to host, I asked them to send me the script ahead of time.
[11621.22 → 11622.22] Got it.
[11622.22 → 11625.22] I read through the whole script at my desk and then go and host it.
[11625.22 → 11627.22] I could never possibly hope to do that.
[11627.22 → 11629.22] It took me a long time.
[11629.22 → 11635.22] You could tell me three numbers and then like play a sound and then ask me to repeat those three numbers.
[11635.22 → 11636.22] I wouldn't be able to tell you what they are.
[11636.22 → 11640.22] Like I have absolutely no short term recall like that.
[11640.22 → 11645.22] I don't know if you remember this, but back in the house, um, I resisted the Teleprompter change.
[11645.22 → 11646.22] Yeah, I know.
[11646.22 → 11647.22] Because I just like, couldn't do it.
[11647.22 → 11656.22] Uh, and then the early version of this style was I just didn't, I would, I would move the script to the fixed part.
[11656.22 → 11657.22] Yeah.
[11657.22 → 11661.22] Sit there and make Brandon at the time, probably wait, read the whole thing.
[11661.22 → 11664.22] It is in my head and then present.
[11664.22 → 11665.22] Right.
[11665.22 → 11666.22] And then I would just do that over and over again.
[11666.22 → 11669.22] And then eventually I just got a little bit better and a little bit better.
[11669.22 → 11677.22] And then I started being able to do that and then move it to the next one and then read what read, but say something else.
[11677.22 → 11679.22] So I'd be like absorbing the information for the next section.
[11679.22 → 11683.22] And then I kind of got from there and there and there and just slowly got a little bit better over time.
[11683.22 → 11687.22] See, I do kind of that, but in much smaller chunks.
[11687.22 → 11688.22] Yeah.
[11688.22 → 11694.22] So I'll do, I'll read ahead, like at most a sentence, uh, but I can't do paragraphs.
[11694.22 → 11696.22] There's absolutely no way.
[11696.22 → 11697.22] Yeah.
[11697.22 → 11698.22] Um, back to, back to your question.
[11698.22 → 11700.22] Like we never fully transitioned, right?
[11700.22 → 11705.22] Like if we do a live stream, when show a build, whatever, that's not scripted.
[11705.22 → 11711.22] Um, I actually, the video that I'm in the middle of shooting right now, that is on the PC build corner at the moment.
[11711.22 → 11714.22] And it's maybe, I don't know, about 25% shot.
[11714.22 → 11720.22] Uh, all I really have is like, um, for each, we're, we're doing a build, we're doing compensator.
[11720.22 → 11721.22] Compensator is coming back.
[11721.22 → 11724.22] Uh, compensator for, uh, let's go.
[11724.22 → 11741.22] Um, and all I have for, you know, a script is just the price of each item, a couple of key specs, just, you know, to make sure that in case I've forgotten, if it's 16 P cores and 80 cores or eight P cores and 16 P cores, like there's a lot of stuff out there.
[11741.22 → 11747.22] Not all of this is hardware that I do know, like obviously I know what a 13, 900 KS is or whatever.
[11747.22 → 11752.22] Um, but you know, this capture card, you know, we'll have a couple of speeds and feeds that matter for it.
[11752.22 → 11755.22] And then a little bit of the rationale for why we chose it for compensator.
[11755.22 → 11756.22] That's all I've got.
[11756.22 → 11758.22] Um, and it's just, it's all point form.
[11758.22 → 11761.22] So I'll just read through it, and then I'll go host the section.
[11761.22 → 11764.22] So we do still do stuff that is unscripted.
[11764.22 → 11765.22] Yeah.
[11765.22 → 11772.22] Um, or like one of the videos that's coming out this weekend is me and Alex, um, basically like cable managing a wall.
[11772.22 → 11775.22] It ends up being a lot more interesting than it sounds.
[11775.22 → 11778.22] I promise you, it's like way more interesting than it sounds.
[11778.22 → 11780.22] Um, but it's completely unscripted.
[11780.22 → 11783.22] We have kind of some main story beats that we expect to hit.
[11783.22 → 11785.22] Like we're going to talk about Wi-Fi audio versus Bluetooth audio.
[11785.22 → 11790.22] And we're going to talk about, you know, the, the costs associated and how you could do this on a, on a tight budget.
[11790.22 → 11794.22] We're going to, you know, like we know approximately what we're going to talk about, but none of it's written out.
[11794.22 → 11796.22] Uh, so it just, yeah, it depends.
[11796.22 → 11798.22] Apparently there's a special font for dyslexics.
[11798.22 → 11802.22] I was going to say, there's a couple of people that mentioned this and I actually did want to talk about that.
[11802.22 → 11804.22] Um, someone mentioned Comic Sans.
[11804.22 → 11806.22] I've heard that before.
[11806.22 → 11808.22] I don't find it makes any difference at all.
[11808.22 → 11809.22] I think personally.
[11809.22 → 11810.22] Yeah.
[11810.22 → 11811.22] I don't know.
[11811.22 → 11816.22] Um, what I have seen, uh, and I, I might say this wrong, but it blew my mind.
[11816.22 → 11819.22] I think I even told you about it was if I remember correctly.
[11819.22 → 11827.22] It's, it's multicoloured text and like the root word is coloured in one colour.
[11827.22 → 11830.22] And then the rest of the word is coloured in another colour.
[11830.22 → 11831.22] I think that's how it goes.
[11831.22 → 11833.22] I don't think anyone linked it.
[11833.22 → 11843.22] Um, but the second I read it, it felt like I was on like nitrous or something like just like I was reading two or three times faster than I normally do.
[11843.22 → 11844.22] Really?
[11844.22 → 11845.22] And I wasn't losing my spot.
[11845.22 → 11848.22] That's my biggest problem is I lose my spot all the time.
[11848.22 → 11849.22] Right.
[11849.22 → 11851.22] I have a really hard, I'll, I'll just, it just, I don't know.
[11851.22 → 11853.22] If there's a superpower that I have.
[11853.22 → 11854.22] You can read wicked fast.
[11854.22 → 11857.22] It's that I can, it's that I can, no, I can skim wicked fast.
[11857.22 → 11858.22] Okay.
[11858.22 → 11859.22] Yeah.
[11859.22 → 11860.22] I can't read wicked fast.
[11860.22 → 11861.22] I actually.
[11861.22 → 11862.22] I can skim sort of okay.
[11862.22 → 11873.22] So my superpower would be that if you hand me a book and let me read for as long as you want and then rip it out of my hands, close it and give it back to me.
[11873.22 → 11876.22] I will be like immediately back to where I left off.
[11876.22 → 11877.22] Oh yeah.
[11877.22 → 11878.22] I don't know.
[11878.22 → 11879.22] I don't know.
[11879.22 → 11885.22] I don't know why it's not usually a useful skill, but it is something that I can do crazy fast.
[11885.22 → 11895.22] And yet, you know, I was talking earlier about how I have basically no recall for exact numbers or exact letters or words.
[11895.22 → 11906.22] But in terms of like, like cues, like familiarity, I have no problem with it.
[11906.22 → 11907.22] So I'll just open a page.
[11907.22 → 11908.22] It'll be like, no, I haven't seen this.
[11908.22 → 11909.22] I've seen this.
[11909.22 → 11910.22] Boom.
[11910.22 → 11912.22] I'm at the spot on the page.
[11912.22 → 11920.22] And like when people would get mad at me for, you know, like I had four, I had four siblings, you know, so someone would get mad at me for losing their spot in the book.
[11920.22 → 11921.22] I'm like, whatever.
[11921.22 → 11922.22] Just who cares about a bookmark?
[11922.22 → 11923.22] Just, just open it.
[11923.22 → 11924.22] Yeah.
[11924.22 → 11925.22] And get to the spot you've read.
[11925.22 → 11926.22] But why does this matter?
[11926.22 → 11933.22] And, and like a lot of people are, I didn't even realize that other people don't skim like that.
[11933.22 → 11937.22] I want to be able to do that with games.
[11937.22 → 11938.22] Yeah.
[11938.22 → 11939.22] That'd be kind of cool.
[11939.22 → 11940.22] Just find your spot in a game.
[11940.22 → 11943.22] Apparently there are tons of examples of this.
[11943.22 → 11945.22] There are tons of different fonts.
[11945.22 → 11946.22] There are tons of different attempts people have made.
[11946.22 → 11947.22] Oh, that's super cool.
[11947.22 → 11948.22] I can.
[11948.22 → 11949.22] We just need to find a prompter app that would support it.
[11949.22 → 11950.22] I'm having a hard time.
[11950.22 → 11951.22] It could also be functional.
[11951.22 → 11958.22] Finding the one that really worked for me and a lot of the ones that people have linked are not it, and they don't feel like they're working right now.
[11958.22 → 11960.22] At least for me.
[11960.22 → 11961.22] Um, so I don't know.
[11961.22 → 11974.22] One of the reasons I thought it was fascinating, but one of the reasons why I didn't try to be like, let's find ways to like to force my computer to load all texts like this, blah, blah, blah, blah, all that kind of stuff is because, and this could be flawed logic.
[11974.22 → 11979.22] But the way I'm thinking about it is I'm going to leave my computer at some point.
[11979.22 → 11987.22] And I find like my ability to read is almost like a forced skill that I have to maintain.
[11987.22 → 11998.22] So if I use this, uh, I don't know if people are not going to like this or not, but if I use this, this crutch of this special font on my computer, I'm not going to have that all the time.
[11998.22 → 12005.22] And I feel like when I'm away from that system, I'm probably going to be worse off because of it.
[12005.22 → 12007.22] If that makes sense.
[12007.22 → 12011.22] I don't know if that's actually true or not, but that's one of the reasons why it's kind of like the same reason.
[12011.22 → 12016.22] I was always interested in learning Dvorak as like a layout, but I'm like, okay.
[12016.22 → 12020.22] But anytime I go to anyone else's computers, it's not going to be Dvorak.
[12020.22 → 12022.22] So like, I don't want to train to learn that.
[12022.22 → 12025.22] It, uh, like, I don't know.
[12025.22 → 12026.22] So it's fascinating.
[12026.22 → 12029.22] I find it very interesting that it works so well.
[12029.22 → 12031.22] You're just the kind of person who plays on hard mode.
[12031.22 → 12032.22] I get it.
[12032.22 → 12033.22] Yeah.
[12033.22 → 12034.22] Like that, that's, you know.
[12034.22 → 12043.22] Um, and you know, what's funny is I was talking to, I forget it, optician or what's an optometrist,
[12043.22 → 12044.22] whatever.
[12044.22 → 12046.22] I was talking to an eye doctor of some sort.
[12046.22 → 12057.22] And, uh, apparently if you force yourself to see clearly, like more clearly, like you, like you can, you can, you can, you can,
[12057.22 → 12061.22] you can achieve slightly better clarity by like, kind of like really trying hard.
[12061.22 → 12069.22] You can actually build up your eye muscles to the point where they will deform your eye, and they will make you less likely to need glasses as, as soon.
[12069.22 → 12070.22] Whoa.
[12070.22 → 12071.22] Whereas.
[12071.22 → 12072.22] And I was communicating it was the opposite.
[12072.22 → 12073.22] That's crazy.
[12073.22 → 12074.22] Well, I don't know.
[12074.22 → 12075.22] Maybe he's wrong.
[12075.22 → 12076.22] Um, yeah, yeah, fair enough.
[12076.22 → 12077.22] And in extreme.
[12077.22 → 12078.22] Non-medical advice, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[12078.22 → 12079.22] Yeah.
[12079.22 → 12081.22] In extreme cases, maybe it would go the other way.
[12081.22 → 12088.22] But, um, but like I asked, I was like, because I have a very mild subscription, subscription, prescription.
[12088.22 → 12089.22] I have a lot of subscriptions.
[12089.22 → 12090.22] It's that's, that's the age we live in.
[12090.22 → 12093.22] Um, I have a very, don't, they're not mild.
[12093.22 → 12095.22] Um, I have a very mild prescription.
[12095.22 → 12105.22] And I asked, I was like, yeah, I, my eyes feel less tired when I use them, but tell me this by not trying as hard all the time.
[12105.22 → 12111.22] Um, am I potentially going to, you know, need my, my glasses more?
[12111.22 → 12116.22] And he's like, in some cases, like trying really hard can actually make a difference.
[12116.22 → 12118.22] And I was like, Oh, interesting.
[12118.22 → 12124.22] Um, so in the same way, like trying really hard to get your brain to like, cause that's trying to do it.
[12124.22 → 12134.22] That's, that's what I feel about the, the prompter stuff is like, uh, I was off video for like years, and now I do it infrequently, but do it sometimes.
[12134.22 → 12136.22] By video, I mean Gods, not Wayne Show.
[12136.22 → 12137.22] I was obviously still doing Wayne Show.
[12137.22 → 12140.22] Um, but I was off, off Gods for a long time.
[12140.22 → 12146.22] And my first few videos back were really hard because I hadn't done prompters in a really long time.
[12146.22 → 12147.22] Yeah.
[12147.22 → 12148.22] And now it's, I'm kinda.
[12148.22 → 12149.22] Oh yeah.
[12149.22 → 12150.22] You were great when we did the thing to.
[12150.22 → 12151.22] Bit of a Lean.
[12151.22 → 12156.22] So yeah, I'm, I'm a little bit more used to it again, a bit like kind of the whole riding a bike thing where like, I definitely didn't lose it entirely.
[12156.22 → 12158.22] Um, but I was rusty.
[12158.22 → 12160.22] Um, and now I feel like I'm kind of getting it back.
[12160.22 → 12163.22] Um, but yeah, that, that's why I haven't like actually used it.
[12163.22 → 12173.22] Too much, but it's super cool that it exists because, um, mine seems pretty mild, all things considered.
[12173.22 → 12176.22] And I, I know people that have it a lot worse.
[12176.22 → 12182.22] So if it's a lot worse, and you like need something, I think it's really cool that something does exist that you could use.
[12182.22 → 12183.22] I think that's awesome.
[12183.22 → 12184.22] This is interesting.
[12184.22 → 12187.22] A lot of people are talking about, uh, just interesting eye stuff.
[12187.22 → 12190.22] Someone said they got corrective lenses that helped alter the shape of their eye.
[12190.22 → 12193.22] Um, so that they didn't need them anymore.
[12193.22 → 12196.22] Like, like it's gonna, it's going to depend on what's wrong with your eye, obviously.
[12196.22 → 12197.22] Right?
[12197.22 → 12200.22] Like someone said, um, yeah, I can see perfectly, but I was getting headaches.
[12200.22 → 12206.22] I went to the optometrist and found out I needed glasses because there, I, I, I'm assuming.
[12206.22 → 12207.22] Their eyes were straining so hard.
[12207.22 → 12212.22] You were straining so hard that the poor muscles were just in a constant state of strain.
[12212.22 → 12214.22] Uh, yeah, that's, that's wild.
[12214.22 → 12219.22] Um, and yes, to be clear, I'm not talking about squinting.
[12219.22 → 12222.22] Anyway, uh, Dan hit me.
[12222.22 → 12223.22] Uh, yeah, sure.
[12223.22 → 12224.22] I got an interim message.
[12224.22 → 12227.22] Uh, it's about the chess problems going back to the pen.
[12227.22 → 12233.22] Uh, they're called chess problems because players come up with challenging theoretical puzzles that don't really matter.
[12233.22 → 12234.22] Ah, okay.
[12234.22 → 12238.22] That's kind of why I was saying it was on the free time, and you're, and you, they were not spending time on this.
[12238.22 → 12246.22] I still disagree because that chess problem could come up in a real game, but the need to model this thing will never be a need to model it.
[12246.22 → 12247.22] It is only for fun.
[12247.22 → 12253.22] I think these chess problems, like the theoretical board state would not get there.
[12253.22 → 12254.22] Oh.
[12254.22 → 12255.22] Do you know what I mean?
[12255.22 → 12258.22] Like it would be a really, really, like you would never play chess.
[12258.22 → 12259.22] Right.
[12259.22 → 12262.22] And get into this board state, but it is a it is possible, right?
[12262.22 → 12263.22] Right.
[12263.22 → 12264.22] Right.
[12264.22 → 12266.22] You have one pawn and your queen and your king.
[12266.22 → 12268.22] And they're all in the wrong places.
[12268.22 → 12269.22] Yeah.
[12269.22 → 12270.22] Okay.
[12270.22 → 12271.22] I understand.
[12271.22 → 12273.22] Like we just modelled the J, and then you make the machine do it, and you're done.
[12273.22 → 12275.22] You don't, you don't spend hours upon hours.
[12275.22 → 12276.22] Uh, I have to, sorry.
[12276.22 → 12278.22] I have to jump back for a second.
[12278.22 → 12280.22] This, I've never seen this before.
[12280.22 → 12284.22] This is not the one I was talking about, but someone linked this in flow plane chat.
[12284.22 → 12292.22] I read this before I recognized that I was even like trying my, my brain registered all
[12292.22 → 12293.22] of the words in this.
[12293.22 → 12297.22] And then I was like, wait, I have to, I didn't go back to the first word to read it.
[12297.22 → 12298.22] And then I was like, hold on.
[12298.22 → 12299.22] I already read all of this.
[12299.22 → 12302.22] Like it was, it literally confusingly fast.
[12302.22 → 12304.22] I've never even seen this font before.
[12304.22 → 12306.22] It is just like immediately absorbed.
[12306.22 → 12307.22] No, probably not.
[12307.22 → 12309.22] And like, I, I don't even think, I think my method is fine.
[12309.22 → 12310.22] Well that's just a Gmail logo.
[12310.22 → 12311.22] That's pretty much.
[12311.22 → 12312.22] No, no.
[12312.22 → 12313.22] It actually does.
[12313.22 → 12314.22] The bottom left really does look like it.
[12314.22 → 12315.22] Yeah.
[12315.22 → 12317.22] No, they're, they're too recognizable as different shapes.
[12317.22 → 12318.22] Uh, but yeah.
[12318.22 → 12319.22] So like, I, I don't know.
[12319.22 → 12320.22] I can't explain it.
[12320.22 → 12323.22] A bunch of the ones that were linked today didn't work for me at all.
[12323.22 → 12327.22] And then this one was like, whoa, yeah, definitely worked right away.
[12327.22 → 12329.22] I have no idea.
[12329.22 → 12330.22] It's weird.
[12330.22 → 12334.22] Um, even if I like found something like that, and I found a way to implement it across all
[12334.22 → 12338.22] the things that I read on my own devices, I probably wouldn't do it because I want
[12338.22 → 12342.22] to keep the learned skill up so that I can do it when that font isn't existing.
[12342.22 → 12344.22] All that kind of stuff I said before is still the same.
[12344.22 → 12346.22] Um, but yeah, I don't know.
[12346.22 → 12348.22] For some reason that worked for me, made it easier.
[12348.22 → 12349.22] Not a clue why.
[12349.22 → 12350.22] Okay.
[12350.22 → 12351.22] Okay.
[12351.22 → 12358.22] If LMG grew to corporate size operating as a mid to large enterprise, could or should
[12358.22 → 12359.22] the WAN show continue?
[12359.22 → 12363.22] Would adding a disclaimer to the show avoid any potential issues?
[12363.22 → 12365.22] I really appreciate you guys.
[12365.22 → 12371.22] So we are a, well, we're not, we're not mid-sized really not by the Canadian definition.
[12371.22 → 12373.22] What it is 200 plus or something like that?
[12373.22 → 12374.22] I thought it was a hundred plus.
[12374.22 → 12375.22] Yeah.
[12375.22 → 12376.22] Or might even be like 500 plus or something.
[12376.22 → 12379.22] We're still a technically a small, small business.
[12379.22 → 12388.22] Um, I'm going to say now I don't ever want to get big enough that the WAN show can't continue.
[12388.22 → 12391.22] The WAN show is something I find genuinely enjoyable.
[12391.22 → 12396.22] Um, it's something that I find helps keep us grounded.
[12396.22 → 12406.22] Um, I, I, I think that being so, so disconnected from the community that I am not allowed or
[12406.22 → 12410.22] feel like I can't talk to them anymore would be really isolating for me.
[12410.22 → 12415.22] Um, and I think by the time I got to that point, I probably just wouldn't want to do it
[12415.22 → 12417.22] anymore is sort of where I'm at on that.
[12417.22 → 12419.22] I think we're a mid-sized company.
[12419.22 → 12420.22] Uh oh.
[12420.22 → 12421.22] Depends on, um, the definition.
[12421.22 → 12423.22] Not everyone defines it the same way.
[12423.22 → 12424.22] Yeah.
[12424.22 → 12425.22] Well.
[12425.22 → 12437.22] This is like, this is like defining generations of people is a meaningless and B nobody agrees.
[12437.22 → 12442.22] So I do agree that it's meaningless, but I did just find a stats Canada government of
[12442.22 → 12447.22] Canada website that says that it's 100 to 499 employees is mid-size.
[12447.22 → 12448.22] Okay.
[12448.22 → 12451.22] So we have several small companies.
[12451.22 → 12452.22] Fair enough.
[12452.22 → 12453.22] Heh, heh.
[12453.22 → 12454.22] Got them.
[12454.22 → 12455.22] Heh heh heh.
[12455.22 → 12456.22] Absolutely inoculated.
[12456.22 → 12457.22] Came out of nowhere.
[12457.22 → 12458.22] Love it.
[12458.22 → 12460.22] I genuinely didn't see that coming.
[12460.22 → 12461.22] Oh boy.
[12461.22 → 12462.22] Last one on my, uh, curated list here.
[12462.22 → 12463.22] Hello LLD.
[12463.22 → 12466.22] Catching the show a bit late, but any update on float plane merch?
[12466.22 → 12467.22] No, I don't think so.
[12467.22 → 12468.22] Uh, oh, there's a lot of stuff.
[12468.22 → 12469.22] I think we're going to be a little bit more.
[12469.22 → 12470.22] I think we're going to be a little bit more.
[12470.22 → 12471.22] I think we're going to be a little bit more.
[12471.22 → 12472.22] I think we're going to be a little bit more.
[12472.22 → 12473.22] Yeah.
[12473.22 → 12474.22] Yeah.
[12474.22 → 12475.22] Yeah.
[12475.22 → 12476.22] Yeah.
[12476.22 → 12481.72] Uh, oh no, we have, um, we have blue base shirts that I think are, we're, we're, we're
[12481.72 → 12484.22] working on production, or maybe I wasn't happy with the colour.
[12484.22 → 12485.22] Well, let's see.
[12485.22 → 12486.22] Here's the problem.
[12486.22 → 12490.22] Uh, float plane, float planes branding was never professionally designed really.
[12490.22 → 12493.22] So on a technical level it was.
[12493.22 → 12494.22] Yeah.
[12494.22 → 12497.22] Well, the point is, it lacked some, they don't have a Pantone.
[12497.22 → 12498.22] Yeah.
[12498.22 → 12502.22] Um, that's a problem when you want to make something that matches something.
[12502.22 → 12506.22] So we got the shirt, and we're like, well, this doesn't match the site.
[12506.22 → 12509.22] It doesn't match the previous float plane shirts we made.
[12509.22 → 12511.22] It is blue.
[12511.22 → 12514.22] So I guess that's, I think it's plain straight up in my opinion.
[12514.22 → 12519.22] If it's a shade of blue, it's probably just pick like 20 Pantone.
[12519.22 → 12522.22] Like a lightish blue is probably like the ocean.
[12522.22 → 12525.22] Ah, it's, it's, it's most of the blue Pantone.
[12525.22 → 12528.22] Even the float plane website has multiple shades of blue on it.
[12528.22 → 12529.22] There's a light blue and a dark blue.
[12529.22 → 12530.22] Oh my.
[12530.22 → 12531.22] I know.
[12531.22 → 12534.22] I was wondering why I didn't have a Pantone in my docs, which is a problem.
[12534.22 → 12535.22] That's nuts.
[12535.22 → 12536.22] Yeah.
[12536.22 → 12541.22] So, uh, I, I don't know where, whereas, whereas ready to go as we are ready to go.
[12541.22 → 12543.22] And I don't really know the, the answer.
[12543.22 → 12547.22] I just, I think the reason why I'm like, uh, is, I mean, if it isn't a Pantone now, it's
[12547.22 → 12552.22] not going to be one later, like at a certain point, just, oh, well.
[12552.22 → 12555.22] And Facebook's 2FA is not working right now.
[12555.22 → 12558.22] And I'll explain why that matters as soon as I can get logged into my account.
[12558.22 → 12559.22] Okay.
[12559.22 → 12560.22] Okay.
[12560.22 → 12562.22] Is this right?
[12562.22 → 12563.22] Hmm.
[12563.22 → 12565.22] Don't save this browser.
[12565.22 → 12566.22] Other people use this computer.
[12566.22 → 12568.22] So wait, is my dad in chat?
[12568.22 → 12569.22] Is your dad in chat?
[12569.22 → 12570.22] What's your dad doing in chat?
[12570.22 → 12575.22] Someone just added liquids, which would be my dad, but I don't see where he said it.
[12575.22 → 12581.22] Oh, he, he pasted micro size company, micro size business, less than 10 employees, small
[12581.22 → 12582.22] size business, 10 to 49.
[12582.22 → 12583.22] Okay.
[12583.22 → 12584.22] That's as defined by Wikipedia.
[12584.22 → 12588.22] If I remember correctly, government of Canada just has small, medium and large.
[12588.22 → 12589.22] Okay.
[12589.22 → 12590.22] I have it.
[12590.22 → 12591.22] I have it.
[12591.22 → 12592.22] So hold on.
[12592.22 → 12593.22] There was a message.
[12593.22 → 12594.22] Okay.
[12594.22 → 12600.22] So Brandon asks, Hey, I've been looking in, been looking into getting into badminton,
[12600.22 → 12603.22] but I have no idea what to look for, for our first racket.
[12603.22 → 12604.22] Where's somewhere to start?
[12604.22 → 12606.22] So you are going to want to start.
[12606.22 → 12610.22] Oh, I wonder, I wonder what my most recent marketplace searches are.
[12610.22 → 12612.22] I guess we're going to see.
[12612.22 → 12613.22] Here we go.
[12613.22 → 12614.22] Air hockey.
[12614.22 → 12615.22] I love air hockey.
[12615.22 → 12616.22] Yeah.
[12616.22 → 12617.22] I was looking for a Capo chill.
[12617.22 → 12618.22] Do you remember those?
[12618.22 → 12619.22] Yeah.
[12619.22 → 12620.22] Yeah.
[12620.22 → 12621.22] I was hoping to get my hands on one.
[12621.22 → 12622.22] I couldn't find one.
[12622.22 → 12623.22] What's okay.
[12623.22 → 12625.22] What is that, that fan controller that you and I both had?
[12625.22 → 12626.22] M cube T balancer.
[12626.22 → 12627.22] Yeah.
[12627.22 → 12628.22] He knew like immediately.
[12628.22 → 12629.22] See, that's the thing.
[12629.22 → 12633.22] I was trying to talk to you about the old German, uh, fan controller.
[12633.22 → 12634.22] That's it.
[12634.22 → 12637.22] My associative memory skills are very good.
[12637.22 → 12638.22] Astounding.
[12638.22 → 12641.22] If you tee me up, I can knock it out of the park.
[12641.22 → 12647.22] But if you ask me to just remember something that I don't care about, or that I have no
[12647.22 → 12651.22] familiarity with, that there's nothing to, to, to seed it.
[12651.22 → 12652.22] Mm-hmm.
[12652.22 → 12653.22] I got nothing.
[12653.22 → 12656.22] I don't remember why we were talking about it, but I was talking about T balancers with
[12656.22 → 12657.22] Dan the other day.
[12657.22 → 12658.22] Oh, okay.
[12658.22 → 12660.22] I still have mine kicking around somewhere.
[12660.22 → 12661.22] Me too.
[12661.22 → 12662.22] What?
[12662.22 → 12663.22] I went, Geez.
[12663.22 → 12664.22] Linus, do you think that's like an ADHD thing?
[12664.22 → 12668.22] Because I find I'm almost identically exactly the same.
[12668.22 → 12669.22] Um, it could be.
[12669.22 → 12670.22] Yeah.
[12670.22 → 12672.22] Could also just be like being a big dumb idiot.
[12672.22 → 12674.22] That is so true.
[12674.22 → 12677.22] You're calling him that.
[12677.22 → 12678.22] But we're a kin.
[12678.22 → 12679.22] Yeah.
[12679.22 → 12681.22] No, I, I, it's a it's a surprise.
[12681.22 → 12685.22] Hey, you got wrinkles in your brain, you know, your bad thoughts.
[12685.22 → 12687.22] No, no bad thoughts, only good thoughts.
[12687.22 → 12691.22] All right.
[12691.22 → 12692.22] Okay.
[12692.22 → 12693.22] Free PC.
[12693.22 → 12695.22] So I was thinking that would be kind of a cool video.
[12695.22 → 12699.22] Like what PC could you get for free for literal free?
[12699.22 → 12700.22] I actually did find some.
[12700.22 → 12704.22] There was one that was like free computer, but you have to take all 10 of them.
[12704.22 → 12708.22] And I was like, I was very close to getting up from my desk and like going and getting the
[12708.22 → 12709.22] wall.
[12709.22 → 12710.22] Yeah.
[12710.22 → 12711.22] Just for fun.
[12711.22 → 12712.22] Uh, computer case.
[12712.22 → 12713.22] I don't remember why I was searching for that.
[12713.22 → 12714.22] Oh, look, badminton racket.
[12714.22 → 12716.22] Because someone asked me this not that long ago.
[12716.22 → 12717.22] A dollar.
[12717.22 → 12718.22] No, that's got to be fake, right?
[12718.22 → 12721.22] Uh, that's probably just people put that, and then they have,
[12721.22 → 12724.22] and then they have pricing in their post for all the individual items.
[12724.22 → 12725.22] Oh, got it.
[12725.22 → 12726.22] Okay.
[12726.22 → 12727.22] So here's the thing.
[12727.22 → 12728.22] Never buy this.
[12728.22 → 12730.22] Uh, this is like plastic wrapped.
[12730.22 → 12736.22] Um, they, these have, uh, probably a T joint here.
[12736.22 → 12740.22] So they're, they're not a one piece, um, frame.
[12740.22 → 12744.22] Uh, you shouldn't be spending like this kind of money.
[12744.22 → 12745.22] This is like 60 us dollars.
[12745.22 → 12748.22] That's, that's a little bit too much to get started.
[12748.22 → 12749.22] Not by much.
[12749.22 → 12754.22] I would say something like this is where you want to start something that is, this is
[12754.22 → 12755.22] a to you, this is pretty heavy.
[12755.22 → 12759.22] So maybe not quite something like this, but something that's a single piece frame.
[12759.22 → 12764.22] And so you can check here as long as it doesn't have any, uh, like a T joint here, that's
[12764.22 → 12765.22] probably fine.
[12765.22 → 12768.22] As long as it's a carbon graphite body.
[12768.22 → 12773.22] Uh, that's basically been the technology since kind of the late eighties, early nineties,
[12773.22 → 12774.22] I guess.
[12774.22 → 12775.22] Finding like an old racket.
[12775.22 → 12780.22] Um, ideally instead of two, you, you want a higher number, like a three, you racket or
[12780.22 → 12781.22] something like that.
[12781.22 → 12785.22] So you get something that's just, yeah, see, this is probably fine.
[12785.22 → 12789.22] And then you should spend another 20, 25 bucks, uh, Canadian.
[12789.22 → 12792.22] So like 15 to $20 us, and you should get it restrung.
[12792.22 → 12799.22] The strings are going to make a way bigger difference than the actual racket itself.
[12799.22 → 12804.22] Oh, do we have some more?
[12804.22 → 12806.22] Uh, I don't have any more curated.
[12806.22 → 12809.22] I can go straight into, uh, the potentials if you want.
[12809.22 → 12812.22] Um, yeah, we can, we can read through them.
[12812.22 → 12813.22] I mean, yeah, there's a, oh yeah.
[12813.22 → 12814.22] Okay.
[12814.22 → 12815.22] Yeah.
[12815.22 → 12816.22] Sure.
[12816.22 → 12817.22] Okay.
[12817.22 → 12819.22] Uh, at Linus, do you think the boom in more powerful handheld gaming devices will cause
[12819.22 → 12820.22] AR to gain popularity?
[12820.22 → 12826.22] No, the apple push into AR is going to cause AR to gain popularity like big time.
[12826.22 → 12829.22] Um, imagine Pokémon on the steam deck.
[12829.22 → 12831.22] Like three played on the go while wearing an AR headset.
[12831.22 → 12833.22] Um, I don't, I don't see that being realistic.
[12833.22 → 12837.22] I just don't think the market is big enough, especially when, um, what is it?
[12837.22 → 12839.22] The Ni antic or whatever their name is.
[12839.22 → 12840.22] What's the what does the Pokemon go?
[12840.22 → 12841.22] That's about right.
[12841.22 → 12842.22] Yeah.
[12842.22 → 12843.22] Yeah.
[12843.22 → 12844.22] Something like that.
[12844.22 → 12845.22] Yeah.
[12845.22 → 12848.22] Um, especially when they're already so invested in like mobile OS development, I, I would,
[12848.22 → 12853.22] I would expect that we will instead see it come, but maybe just a little bit later
[12853.22 → 12858.22] once the hardware that's already in your pocket is capable of, uh, a more AR like experience.
[12858.22 → 12864.22] Um, anonymous asks, you've mentioned your ADHD helps you come up with new ideas because
[12864.22 → 12867.22] you get bored quickly, but what are some challenges, and how do you overcome them?
[12867.22 → 12868.22] Oh, lots of challenges.
[12868.22 → 12870.22] I get bored really quickly.
[12870.22 → 12877.22] And honestly, it's, um, it's like a superpower, but it's also kryptonite.
[12877.22 → 12883.22] Like it's, uh, I, I, I, I just like, don't know what to do with myself a lot of the time.
[12883.22 → 12885.22] Like, you know, why, why do you workaholic?
[12885.22 → 12886.22] I don't know what else to do.
[12886.22 → 12889.22] I just need to like do stuff.
[12889.22 → 12890.22] Uh, I don't know.
[12890.22 → 12891.22] Yeah.
[12891.22 → 12892.22] It's, uh, it's tough.
[12892.22 → 12893.22] Yeah.
[12893.22 → 12898.22] You know, I'm obviously, you know, for me, it's, uh, it's not debilitating, which is,
[12898.22 → 12899.22] you know, perfect.
[12899.22 → 12902.22] I'm really, I'm really thankful for that, but it's, it can be a challenge sometimes.
[12902.22 → 12903.22] Yeah.
[12903.22 → 12907.22] Finally ordered a water bottle says Jacob W.
[12907.22 → 12908.22] Such a wonderful upgrade.
[12908.22 → 12910.22] Is there any product that the staff?
[12910.22 → 12912.22] No, a straw for the water bottle.
[12912.22 → 12914.22] Oh, a straw for the water bottle.
[12914.22 → 12917.22] Is there any product that the staff has upgraded with a third party item?
[12917.22 → 12920.22] I'm sure people have upgraded basically everything with third party items.
[12920.22 → 12925.22] Um, I mean, we are working on a lid upgrade of our own.
[12925.22 → 12927.22] So that's something I guess I can, I can leak.
[12927.22 → 12930.22] Uh, one of the big things, no, I will not leak it.
[12932.22 → 12935.22] My, uh, I, I ask.
[12935.22 → 12936.22] Because it's a water bottle lid.
[12936.22 → 12937.22] You don't, it's pretty good.
[12937.22 → 12938.22] Don't want it to leak.
[12938.22 → 12939.22] It's pretty good.
[12939.22 → 12941.22] But it'll have easily removable O-rings, little pull tabs on them.
[12941.22 → 12942.22] Little pull tabs on them.
[12942.22 → 12943.22] So you can clean them better.
[12943.22 → 12944.22] Cool.
[12944.22 → 12945.22] Yeah.
[12945.22 → 12946.22] That's like one.
[12946.22 → 12948.22] That's like the big feature aside from just being a little bit more robust.
[12948.22 → 12954.22] I, I, uh, asked for carabiners were on my Christmas list and my brother got me these
[12954.22 → 12958.22] like awesome, like, uh, rock climbing quality carabiners.
[12958.22 → 12960.22] So I added those to the backpack.
[12960.22 → 12962.22] I don't know if that would count as modding.
[12962.22 → 12963.22] Yeah, sure.
[12963.22 → 12964.22] Upgrading.
[12964.22 → 12965.22] But I really liked the carabiner that was on there.
[12965.22 → 12968.22] I thought it was cool that it came with one on that side bit.
[12968.22 → 12973.22] Um, but I was like, I want more and ones that can carry your like heavier stuff.
[12973.22 → 12975.22] Cause those straps that the carabiner is on are very strong.
[12975.22 → 12977.22] You can hang some pretty serious things off there.
[12977.22 → 12981.22] So it makes the backpack like extensible, which is pretty sick.
[12981.22 → 12982.22] Okay.
[12982.22 → 12984.22] A couple more curated here.
[12984.22 → 12985.22] Okay.
[12985.22 → 12986.22] Uh, hey, wan.dll.
[12986.22 → 12987.22] First merch message.
[12987.22 → 12995.22] I've been a systems administrator for Unix for over 25 years and recently had a heart attack.
[12995.22 → 13000.22] Any suggestions if I no longer want to manage a million dollar plus projects and-
[13000.22 → 13001.22] I think a million plus.
[13001.22 → 13006.22] Oh, just million plus projects and not be on call 24 seven.
[13006.22 → 13010.22] If we knew the answer to that, we wouldn't be.
[13010.22 → 13012.22] We wouldn't be here.
[13012.22 → 13013.22] Please tell us.
[13013.22 → 13014.22] Yeah.
[13014.22 → 13018.22] If you figure it out, you don't even need to send a merch message.
[13018.22 → 13019.22] Okay.
[13019.22 → 13024.22] Just, just fire me an email and I will, I will, uh, be grateful to your sage wisdom sharing
[13024.22 → 13025.22] that you've done with me.
[13025.22 → 13026.22] Thank you.
[13026.22 → 13028.22] I'm so sorry.
[13028.22 → 13029.22] Hello.
[13029.22 → 13032.22] I hope for a speedy recovery though, by the way.
[13032.22 → 13036.22] Oh, that's why it's buzzing.
[13036.22 → 13037.22] My phone.
[13037.22 → 13038.22] And your phone.
[13038.22 → 13039.22] Sorry.
[13039.22 → 13041.22] I was, I was responding to something.
[13041.22 → 13044.22] So I missed that, but, uh, oh no, no, no, no, not there.
[13044.22 → 13047.22] Um, uh, but yeah, I don't know.
[13047.22 → 13048.22] That's a tough one.
[13048.22 → 13052.22] What I was thinking, and I'm sorry if you, you said this already, but what I was thinking,
[13052.22 → 13058.22] uh, because I, IT and systems administration is just kind of like that.
[13058.22 → 13063.22] Uh, but you might be able to work with the organization that you're in and turn into more
[13063.22 → 13066.22] of like a, a training and advisory role.
[13066.22 → 13071.22] Um, you have some very serious experience, so you could be very effective in that rate,
[13071.22 → 13072.22] in that way.
[13072.22 → 13077.22] Um, yeah, I don't know.
[13077.22 → 13078.22] Yeah.
[13078.22 → 13079.22] Hello, LLND.
[13079.22 → 13084.22] I had to get a couple of screwdrivers to match my company's red dump trucks.
[13084.22 → 13085.22] Nice.
[13085.22 → 13091.22] What videos do you wish you could get a do-over or revisit with the resources you have
[13091.22 → 13092.22] now?
[13092.22 → 13102.22] I'd love to do whole room water cooling again, but like properly, like bangin', like awesome.
[13102.22 → 13107.22] Um, and I'm like kind of doing it with the pool, but it was, it was super cool having
[13107.22 → 13109.22] it is like plumbed into the office.
[13109.22 → 13114.22] Um, I, I, you know, I'd love to have, uh, you know, chilled water at a fixed temperature
[13114.22 → 13118.22] on tap for the lab, for example, for testing, you know, if we ever tested water blocks or
[13118.22 → 13119.22] something, not that anyone cares.
[13119.22 → 13122.22] Like they all basically perform within a very narrowband anyway.
[13122.22 → 13127.22] So people went from caring a lot about water block performance back in like the mid-two
[13127.22 → 13132.22] thousands, maybe even late two thousands to now mostly mid two thousands to like.
[13132.22 → 13133.22] Large the aesthetics.
[13133.22 → 13138.22] Now I don't think, I don't think, does EK even publish performance numbers on their site?
[13138.22 → 13139.22] I think it's just aesthetic.
[13139.22 → 13140.22] I don't know.
[13140.22 → 13143.22] Um, and, and that's, to be clear, I'm not saying that's a huge problem.
[13143.22 → 13148.22] It's been a pretty much solved problem since about 2005 to 2008.
[13148.22 → 13151.22] Uh, maybe like into 2010.
[13151.22 → 13158.22] Um, but it's basically now it's just an optimization exercise for every given platform where you're
[13158.22 → 13162.22] just playing around with your major variables, which are the restrictiveness of the design.
[13162.22 → 13166.22] Uh, how much impingement you want on the copper plate, the thickness of the plate and the density
[13166.22 → 13168.22] of the pin or fin structure.
[13168.22 → 13169.22] Like it's about it.
[13169.22 → 13175.22] When, when, uh, Swift tech released the, uh, Apogee SKF, I think it is, but it's like sky,
[13175.22 → 13180.22] it has skived copper, which basically means you take copper, and you have a blade that is
[13180.22 → 13185.22] so sharp and so thin that you shave the copper and then fold it up into a fin.
[13185.22 → 13188.22] And then you shave the copper and fold it up into a fin.
[13188.22 → 13191.22] And then you create like a micro fin structure like that.
[13192.22 → 13193.22] That's it.
[13193.22 → 13194.22] That's the end game.
[13194.22 → 13201.22] There's no, there's no further, further thinness increase in, in, in surface area per, per unit,
[13201.22 → 13207.22] uh, you know, CPU dye area that you can possibly achieve at that point because, um, it becomes,
[13207.22 → 13213.22] uh, impractical to have the fins go any higher, and it becomes impractical to have them any closer
[13213.22 → 13218.22] together because you just wouldn't have enough room for water to reach the very base where
[13218.22 → 13220.22] most of the thermal transfer is actually happening.
[13220.22 → 13224.22] Like nothing's actually happening once you, once the fins are over, you know, a millimetre
[13224.22 → 13225.22] or a couple of millimetres high.
[13225.22 → 13228.22] So that's why all designs are like kind of the same.
[13228.22 → 13235.22] Um, and because any modern microprocessor is going to be designed to be air cooled, any
[13235.22 → 13240.22] modern water block design, not even a state of the art one is going to be fine.
[13240.22 → 13243.22] As long as you have adequate radiator capacity.
[13243.22 → 13246.22] So, um, just, I don't know.
[13246.22 → 13247.22] It's just the kind of thing.
[13247.22 → 13251.22] I don't think we would ever get into reviewing because it frankly just doesn't matter anymore.
[13253.22 → 13258.22] I am a Salesforce developer with an idea to create a business to business platform as a service,
[13258.22 → 13260.22] but I have no minimal viable product.
[13260.22 → 13264.22] What advice would you give to somebody starting out with no business management experience?
[13264.22 → 13265.22] Any pitfalls to avoid?
[13265.22 → 13266.22] All of them.
[13266.22 → 13270.22] Um, just do your best, you know, try and do better every day.
[13270.22 → 13272.22] That's, uh, that's basically all I can tell you, right?
[13273.22 → 13274.22] It's tough though.
[13274.22 → 13275.22] Be ready.
[13276.22 → 13279.22] And all that's left is one and incoming and that's all we got.
[13280.22 → 13282.22] Oh, there's two now.
[13283.22 → 13284.22] It's getting out of hand.
[13285.22 → 13286.22] I got one.
[13286.22 → 13290.22] I'm going to add a sorry.
[13290.22 → 13291.22] So it's nicer sounding.
[13293.22 → 13299.22] Do you think there's a future where Nintendo bows out of the console space, and we see Nintendo IPs on Xbox, PlayStation, et cetera.
[13299.22 → 13301.22] I mean, we already saw like a mobile Mario game at some point.
[13301.22 → 13302.22] That was very surprising.
[13302.22 → 13305.22] And then they like stopped as far as my understanding goes.
[13305.22 → 13310.22] Are they still, they did Mario run or jump or whatever it's called.
[13311.22 → 13313.22] Um, they do anything after that?
[13313.22 → 13320.22] Super Mario run was 2016.
[13320.22 → 13332.22] The most recent one, as far as I can see in a rough Google search is 2021 with Pikmin Bloom Mario Kart world tour animal crossing pocket camp was apparently a huge success.
[13332.22 → 13337.22] Pokémon sleep in 2023, but they've technically already done stuff because Pokémon Go.
[13337.22 → 13339.22] I don't know if I know.
[13339.22 → 13343.22] I know Nintendo owns a pretty significant amount of the Pokémon company, but they're not the sole owner.
[13344.22 → 13345.22] Hmm.
[13345.22 → 13352.22] Uh, Marvin, the robot says to Bauer talked about how that method of fin manufacturing made thermal transfer worse.
[13353.22 → 13355.22] And it's like, like I said, it's, it's all trade-offs, right?
[13355.22 → 13358.22] So you can machine it, but you can only get a bit so small.
[13358.22 → 13359.22] You can skive it, but sure.
[13359.22 → 13360.22] It might harm thermal transfer.
[13361.22 → 13370.22] The point is that without some kind of complete revolution in manufacturing techniques, we're not going to see blocks with materially different performance anymore.
[13370.22 → 13376.22] Mario Kart tour, which I've never personally heard of is a free.
[13376.22 → 13378.22] I'm sure there are microtransactions mobile game.
[13379.22 → 13389.22] Um, with a rating of 4.3 stars that has 2.1 and a half million votes on Android alone.
[13389.22 → 13390.22] There you go.
[13390.22 → 13391.22] All right.
[13391.22 → 13395.22] I don't think, I don't think Nintendo is going to get sick of selling their own hardware anytime soon, though.
[13395.22 → 13396.22] Yeah.
[13396.22 → 13398.22] I think they're a very traditional company.
[13398.22 → 13401.22] And it's honestly been to their benefit in a big way.
[13401.22 → 13403.22] Like for all you, you can hit on Nintendo all you want.
[13403.22 → 13404.22] I sure do.
[13404.22 → 13417.22] The fact that you can't back up your save games on a mobile device without paying for a monthly subscription is one of the most anti-consumer, just brazenly anti-consumer things in gaming today, in my humble opinion.
[13417.22 → 13423.22] Um, to me, the value of my save game is so much higher than the value of the cartridge that I bought.
[13423.22 → 13426.22] Like it's, it's, it's everything depending on the game that you're playing.
[13426.22 → 13447.22] And, um, but to their credit, they're one of the they're one of the few companies that has remained committed to just single player or, or multiplayer contained experiences that you don't have to pay a whack ton of money for after you've already bought them.
[13447.22 → 13456.22] They're doing that apparently, but they're also delivering on those self-contained traditional experiences.
[13456.22 → 13457.22] And I think that's super cool.
[13457.22 → 13458.22] Mm-hmm.
[13458.22 → 13461.22] And I think it's super cool that the WAN show is over.
[13461.22 → 13463.22] We will see you again next week.
[13463.22 → 13466.22] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[13466.22 → 13467.22] Bye!
[13467.22 → 13469.22] Man, you guys love pins.
[13469.22 → 13470.22] Bye!
[13499.22 → 13500.22] Bye!
[13500.22 → 13501.22] Bye!
