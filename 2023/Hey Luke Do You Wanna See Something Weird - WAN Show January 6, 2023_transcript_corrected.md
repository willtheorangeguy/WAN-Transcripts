[0.00 → 4.00] What is up everyone? How are you doing? And welcome to the WAN Show!
[4.00 → 12.00] We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today. AMD boldly announces new Ry zen 7000 non-X and X3D chips
[12.00 → 19.00] while Intel quietly launches 16 13th gen CPUs to compete against them.
[19.00 → 24.00] With no reviews, no actual fanfare whatsoever.
[24.00 → 27.00] Alright. Very interesting choice. And different strategies.
[27.00 → 32.00] Also, hey Luke. Hey. Do you want to see some really weird stuff?
[32.00 → 35.00] Yeah. Because I have got some displays to show you.
[35.00 → 39.00] Don't look at them yet. We'll look at them later. What else we got today?
[39.00 → 44.00] Okay. Wizards of the Coast are being just jerks.
[44.00 → 48.00] That's all the info I'm going to give you. Yeah, they're actual butthead wizards now.
[48.00 → 52.00] Yeah. Yeah, they're not welcome on our coast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[52.00 → 60.00] And what else? I told myself I was going to pick one early, but I actually didn't do it.
[60.00 → 63.00] If he complains about the topics today. Oh, perfect.
[63.00 → 68.00] It'll be on me because unlike most WAN shows, I actually handpicked all the topics today.
[68.00 → 70.00] So come at me. Oh, did you? Come at me.
[70.00 → 75.00] No, no, no. Microsoft asked ChatGPT, how do I fix Bing and Windows search?
[75.00 → 79.00] Ooh, interesting. I wonder what the answer was.
[79.00 → 104.00] The show is brought to you today by Acer, The Ridge, and Squarespace.
[104.00 → 108.00] Why don't we jump right into our headline topic today.
[108.00 → 114.00] Hey, Luke. Look at these weird displays. Okay, you're not allowed. Don't look at anything. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[114.00 → 115.00] Okay. Okay. All right.
[115.00 → 121.00] Plenty of high resolution and high refresh rate monitors were unveiled at CES this year.
[121.00 → 132.00] But I want to show Luke the monitor technologies that require a little more justification than big and sharp and high refresh rate.
[132.00 → 142.00] We are going to have him play a little game where he tries to come up with some potential use case for any of this.
[142.00 → 143.00] Okay.
[143.00 → 145.00] Do you think you can do it? Are you ready?
[145.00 → 149.00] Yeah, I actually think I can. I don't know what any of the monitors are, but I'm sure I can think of something.
[149.00 → 155.00] We're going to start here. I'm just going to fire up my laptop sharing thing here. There you go. It's up there.
[155.00 → 167.00] We're going to start with ASUS Spatial Vision. That's right. This is a laptop with the world's first glasses-free 3D OLED technology.
[167.00 → 168.00] Okay. Okay. Okay.
[168.00 → 177.00] The way it works is it actually has a camera on the front of the laptop on the bezel that looks at where your eyes are.
[177.00 → 185.00] So rather I should say stereo cameras that look at where your eyes are and automatically readjusts the alignment of the image,
[185.00 → 195.00] which achieves stereo separation by splitting up every vertical line. So every other line is a right eye image and every other line is a left eye image.
[195.00 → 199.00] Okay. And you do not need 3D glasses.
[199.00 → 205.00] I think this one's pretty easy. I mean, there's lots of like 3D content. 3D movies.
[205.00 → 206.00] Is there?
[206.00 → 207.00] I, okay.
[207.00 → 208.00] Is there though?
[208.00 → 209.00] I might have to qualify.
[209.00 → 213.00] Are you sure that the year is not 2014?
[213.00 → 218.00] There are lots of old ones. Yeah. They made a bunch of old ones for a very short period of time.
[218.00 → 223.00] And maybe you haven't watched any of them because it was horrible back then and very not accessible back then.
[223.00 → 226.00] And now you can buy a specific laptop just to be able to see that.
[226.00 → 231.00] Are you sure that Nvidia even makes a stereo 3D driver anymore?
[231.00 → 234.00] Oh, that's interesting.
[234.00 → 236.00] But there's got to be other ways.
[237.00 → 239.00] I'm sure if it's, it's a laptop, right?
[239.00 → 243.00] So I'm sure whatever they are powering the laptop with is able to display it.
[243.00 → 245.00] Okay. What would you do with it?
[245.00 → 248.00] I don't want it. I do nothing with it.
[248.00 → 254.00] I have no personal use case for this at all. This is stupid. There's no way I would buy that. No question.
[254.00 → 256.00] No question.
[256.00 → 260.00] All right. After Luke gives his answer, I'm going to give the real answer.
[260.00 → 261.00] So...
[261.00 → 264.00] I'm assuming it has something to do with like architectural stuff.
[264.00 → 275.00] There are apparently 2D to 3D layers that you can apply to games to the point where you can play games that were not developed for stereoscopic 3D.
[275.00 → 278.00] In stereo 3D, it adds another camera view somehow.
[278.00 → 279.00] What games?
[280.00 → 282.00] Apparently modern ones. I have not tried it.
[282.00 → 284.00] This does not sound like it's going to be every game.
[284.00 → 286.00] I have not personally tried it, sir.
[286.00 → 287.00] Okay.
[287.00 → 289.00] Sir, I'm going to have to ask you, sir.
[289.00 → 290.00] Sir.
[290.00 → 293.00] I wouldn't try this with multiplayer games. You're probably going to get banned.
[293.00 → 296.00] Okay, but more realistically, professional applications...
[296.00 → 297.00] Yeah.
[297.00 → 302.00] Where your boss comes to your desk. This is an alternative to throwing on a VR headset.
[302.00 → 303.00] Yeah.
[303.00 → 307.00] So, theoretically, I think... Ooh, don't quote me on this.
[307.00 → 312.00] No, it obviously wouldn't be able to attract two people at once. Okay, I don't know. Just ignore it.
[312.00 → 317.00] But the point is, if someone was at your desk, you could show them and manipulate a model...
[317.00 → 318.00] Build the side, whatever.
[318.00 → 322.00] And it could pop out or go behind the screen, and they could really get a better sense of the scale.
[322.00 → 323.00] Like, say for example...
[323.00 → 325.00] Why is it a laptop?
[325.00 → 330.00] Just... Can you just... Help me out here, okay?
[330.00 → 332.00] Because, well, I guess the architectural thing, right?
[332.00 → 335.00] And I think that's kind of the direction that you're talking about right now.
[335.00 → 337.00] So, okay, yeah, professional, whatever.
[337.00 → 338.00] Sure.
[338.00 → 343.00] But then, like, literally the scenario that you're describing, there is zero benefit to it being a laptop.
[343.00 → 356.00] So, anyway, during the development of the screwdriver, say for example, if Alex could have modelled out at life-size, you know, different handle shapes or something like that, that might have been pretty cool.
[356.00 → 357.00] Sure.
[357.00 → 358.00] That's the real answer.
[358.00 → 359.00] Yeah.
[359.00 → 360.00] All right, are you ready for number two?
[360.00 → 361.00] Sure.
[361.00 → 365.00] The Lenovo Think Plus Twist.
[365.00 → 366.00] Twist.
[368.00 → 369.00] Okay.
[369.00 → 373.00] Think Book Plus Reinvent's Rotating Design Form Factor.
[373.00 → 375.00] That's right, my friends.
[375.00 → 384.00] This guy has a high-resolution OLED panel on one side and an e-ink display on the other side.
[384.00 → 386.00] Uh...
[386.00 → 388.00] Wow.
[388.00 → 392.00] That sounds like a lot of easily damaged things that are hard to protect.
[392.00 → 393.00] Um...
[394.00 → 396.00] What is this for?
[396.00 → 397.00] Yeah.
[397.00 → 398.00] Whoa.
[398.00 → 405.00] Saving battery life if you're doing, uh, simple tasks that, that involve only, like, text editing or writing emails or something.
[405.00 → 407.00] Ooh, I like it.
[407.00 → 408.00] I like it.
[408.00 → 410.00] Because I'm assuming you can full turn off the other side, right?
[410.00 → 412.00] I believe you can, yes.
[412.00 → 413.00] Yeah.
[413.00 → 415.00] It comes with a pen that supports both displays.
[415.00 → 417.00] That's kind of cool.
[417.00 → 425.00] I think the main one, though, that they were focused on was, like, using it as an e-ink tablet, as, like, a reader.
[425.00 → 426.00] Yeah.
[426.00 → 431.00] Which you would only do, really, if you wanted to save battery life.
[431.00 → 432.00] Yeah.
[432.00 → 435.00] It also sounds like a very heavy e-reader.
[435.00 → 436.00] Yes.
[436.00 → 438.00] I don't know.
[438.00 → 439.00] Yeah.
[439.00 → 440.00] Okay.
[440.00 → 441.00] Yes.
[441.00 → 442.00] Next?
[442.00 → 443.00] Um...
[443.00 → 444.00] Okay.
[444.00 → 446.00] Gabe927 in Twitch chat says,
[446.00 → 450.00] I owned the original Twist, and it was extremely unreliable.
[450.00 → 451.00] Okay.
[451.00 → 452.00] Fair enough.
[452.00 → 453.00] Uh, alright.
[453.00 → 454.00] Next up.
[454.00 → 455.00] Ooh, this is good.
[455.00 → 457.00] We've got a TV.
[457.00 → 459.00] It's a 4K TV.
[459.00 → 460.00] Okay.
[460.00 → 461.00] It's OLED.
[461.00 → 462.00] It's 4K?
[462.00 → 463.00] Yeah, yeah.
[463.00 → 464.00] 4K.
[464.00 → 465.00] Lots of K's.
[465.00 → 466.00] New TV with 4K.
[466.00 → 467.00] 4K's.
[467.00 → 468.00] 4K's.
[468.00 → 469.00] It's OLED.
[469.00 → 470.00] It's higher than last gen OLED.
[470.00 → 471.00] Okay.
[471.00 → 474.00] Um, it's 97 inches.
[474.00 → 475.00] That's a lot.
[475.00 → 477.00] Which is a lot of inches.
[477.00 → 486.00] But, the big, the big wow factor feature of this display is that it is wireless.
[486.00 → 487.00] Um, hold on.
[487.00 → 488.00] Hold on.
[488.00 → 489.00] Hold on.
[489.00 → 490.00] Hold on.
[490.00 → 491.00] Hold on.
[491.00 → 492.00] Hold on.
[492.00 → 493.00] Do you know?
[493.00 → 494.00] Wait, like entirely?
[494.00 → 496.00] Do you know the Samsung One Connect box?
[496.00 → 497.00] No.
[497.00 → 498.00] Okay.
[498.00 → 503.38] Basically, Samsung has this super slim cable that you can wire up your wall, and that carries
[503.38 → 507.82] power and display, and then this box that you can have in your media console that has
[507.82 → 512.82] all your HDMI inputs and, you know, your optical connection, you know, Ethernet, whatever,
[512.82 → 513.82] whatever else.
[513.82 → 514.82] Yeah.
[514.82 → 515.82] Yeah.
[515.82 → 516.82] So, how do you know the Xbox?
[516.82 → 519.82] Well, LG is kicking that up a notch with the zero connect box.
[519.82 → 521.28] How do they deliver power?
[521.28 → 522.28] It...
[522.28 → 523.28] Okay.
[523.28 → 524.28] Why?
[524.28 → 526.00] Why you have to be an asshole?
[526.00 → 527.04] Well, I'm just...
[527.04 → 528.76] You're saying it's, it's cable-less.
[528.76 → 529.76] Okay.
[529.76 → 538.70] The box, the zero connect box, wirelessly transmits 120HZ 4K video with, they apparently haven't
[538.70 → 541.78] measured it, very low latency.
[541.78 → 543.30] They haven't measured it.
[543.30 → 549.78] is complete crap there is no way they haven't measured it i actually I would, I don't make bets
[549.78 → 555.62] I guarantee you they have measured it there is no chance where they have not measured it
[555.62 → 559.46] I'm sure they just don't want to report it is supports g-sync that's cool
[560.02 → 564.82] okay how does it receive power from the wall what the heck
[568.26 → 573.22] I don't if you're sending one k I can understand okay I'm sending one cable that's a lot better
[573.22 → 579.86] than like 15 if you're talking about like a computer or something sending one cable compared to two is
[579.86 → 585.06] not a problem I actually don't care about this don't forget that the Samsung one connect is one
[585.06 → 593.62] cable oh that's way worse for this okay one justification I will give you the one possible
[593.62 → 598.34] justification a is part of their signature line I don't think they expect to sell a ton of
[598.34 → 604.42] them I hope not and b don't be a dick they might want to measure that latency first before they do
[604.42 → 613.06] that and b okay a potential use case for this could be the actual viable version of the video
[613.06 → 619.22] we did earlier this week with the wireless gpu yeah so you can have it's a 97-inch TV
[619.78 → 626.50] that is basically like theatre size and if you could have your connection box in a cabinet on the side of
[626.50 → 632.34] the room or at the back of the room or whatever and all your consoles and all your other crap is over there
[632.34 → 635.94] and all you need is power it could make for a very clean install
[637.94 → 642.98] but you can afford a theatre room and a signature TV so you can probably afford a drywaller
[644.02 → 650.50] so like just run one of the cables cut a hole in the wall and embed a cable in the wall I will say for this one I will give them a prop
[650.50 → 655.70] a prop it's a cool like progression of technology sure it just doesn't matter because you're still
[655.70 → 664.74] sending a power cable yes, but it could matter in the future in some other device or once if they figure
[664.74 → 672.58] out like high uh high whatever wireless power etc sure something high wattage yeah yeah I don't know
[672.58 → 680.34] all right I got another one for you this is the Lenovo yoga book 9i okay I like yoga books that's it
[682.02 → 682.50] that's it
[685.62 → 691.78] wow how does that not flip over does it have a stand in the back it does have an included kickstand yes
[691.78 → 700.42] is it like big I mean I guess I can't even see oh no that's oh okay yeah yeah here we go here we go
[700.42 → 713.06] um wow okay interesting wow it can go into a lot so does it do how does this work does this oh
[713.06 → 720.58] because this fell asleep that happens is that you yeah way to go Luke oh
[723.46 → 728.18] if my laptop screen turns off oh the HDMI stops grabbing the audio
[728.18 → 731.70] ah so it starts out putting through the speakers got it solved uh so
[733.30 → 736.66] ah I'm having a hard time understanding how it works do the screens come off
[737.22 → 741.22] the keyboard definitely comes off okay yeah so that's how you get into the other
[741.22 → 745.94] configurations, so the keyboard just like sits on the bottom screen it's two screens that clamshell together
[746.74 → 754.50] yeah, yeah so you can put the keyboard here and use some screen as like a wrist rest okay so to like
[754.50 → 760.10] move the laptop around like I want to throw it in my bag yes you close the screens together yes
[760.66 → 767.22] the keyboard is off you put the whole like two-piece unit into your bag and then move I don't hate it
[768.42 → 772.50] I didn't ask if you hate it I asked what you would use it there's definitely use cases for a dual screen
[772.50 → 777.54] laptop sure um like I don't know that's not I don't think that's uh even worth going through all
[777.54 → 781.54] of them there are lots of things that you could use two screens for okay um some of the configurations
[781.54 → 785.78] were a little funny I think that one where you have them both vertical like you have to i didn't
[785.78 → 790.34] really see something in any of the product photos that's going to hold that up um I see a lot of
[790.34 → 798.18] flipped yoga laptops just flopping all over the place but when they had them both um like the format
[798.18 → 803.62] was in portrait they had them both like that actually kind of made more sense to me that's pretty
[803.62 → 807.22] cool I could see that being pretty cool for like development or something like that I could see this
[807.22 → 811.78] being like an actual thing that people actually buy all right you ready for the next one yes there
[811.78 → 817.14] were a lot of wild display concepts at CES this year it's fun when they do that I should say there are
[817.14 → 820.90] CES is still on flex hybrid
[820.90 → 830.82] these things that are all right
[830.82 → 840.90] what's going on here is this a phone what is it what is it supposed to is it a tablet you tell me Luke I don't know
[840.90 → 850.10] it looks like it's supposed to be a phone like the camera in the corner looked like a phone camera
[851.38 → 856.10] um okay do you want to see it again do you want to see it again yeah, yeah okay here we go here we go
[856.10 → 858.26] we'll see it again like that looked like a phone thing
[862.26 → 862.58] why
[862.58 → 870.34] but look there's all the styles over here sure no one's ever going to make specific apps for this
[870.34 → 872.10] by the way whoever came up with that
[874.90 → 881.54] okay so it's the same as as your phone, but it's huge, and also you can make it really bigger
[882.82 → 890.18] um again this feels like cool technology but I don't think that device itself matters if that makes
[890.18 → 896.50] sense okay, and we've seen all of that before we've seen like where it kind of rolls out more screen when you pull on it
[896.50 → 898.66] I don't think we've seen them together
[899.30 → 904.50] correct I don't think we have I'm just saying the individual pieces we have seen before oh there's more from Samsung
[904.58 → 909.78] oh great very good Samsung display I should clarify slidable flex yes
[911.30 → 913.46] I actually like this Luke reacts channel
[913.46 → 924.74] okay so what okay again what is this is it supposed to be a display it's the slidable flex solo right
[924.74 → 929.78] but like I see a game on it that looks like the new knee for speed unbound potentially um
[931.54 → 936.66] is it plugged into a computer no it's its so it's a tablet I'd say it's a tablet
[936.66 → 954.02] okay this is weird how the app the how it's being used right now is really weird I guess it's just playing a video yeah
[954.74 → 959.46] sure of someone using it yes it's not actually in use I mean this is kind of neat
[959.46 → 966.42] I guess I don't know I wouldn't want it that's not the question Luke the question is what could you use it for
[966.42 → 971.54] I mean it's just a tablet that gets bigger so it's its probably easier to carry around especially if
[971.54 → 975.30] you're not carrying around a backpack so you're carrying around like a purse, and you find that
[975.30 → 981.62] this can fit in there, but then you can make it bigger things that you can make bigger go in there
[981.62 → 987.78] okay yeah they can what about this thing you can make bigger what is this slidable flex
[990.42 → 998.02] oh so it just goes both directions it's even bigger it's the bigger wrist it's it's the bigger
[998.02 → 1005.70] raider are these are they actually planning on selling these okay are they just like your kind of
[1005.70 → 1011.06] you kind of hit the nail on the head okay this is Samsung display okay so it's like a technology
[1011.06 → 1019.22] division it's not Samsung electronics got it, so this is and Luke didn't know so it's fortunate he
[1019.22 → 1024.98] didn't say anything too rude uh, but we actually have a sponsored video on these coming out very
[1024.98 → 1031.06] soon um the tech is cool these are tech demos, and it looks they're all tech demos from that
[1031.70 → 1037.94] which is not fair they look well I'd say they look better done than the versions of this that we've
[1037.94 → 1043.78] seen in the past I think that's fair to say, but they aren't cooked yeah, and they're not intended to be
[1043.78 → 1050.18] yeah these are tech demos and that's that makes sense, but they're pretty wild it's cool I could
[1050.82 → 1057.06] the both directions or one direction thing doesn't really matter to me but a tablet that expands i
[1057.06 → 1062.50] totally understand that makes sense I've never been a tablet person but the tablet people that I know
[1062.50 → 1067.54] would probably like that you know it's funny I'm actually the opposite way um they had a lot more
[1067.54 → 1071.06] things that they showed off that will be in the video guys make sure you don't miss it because
[1071.06 → 1078.58] their just their displays demo this year was wild that was not all of it for real um in the tablet
[1078.58 → 1083.22] form factor there was actually one that I liked better they have uh I forget what I forget what
[1083.22 → 1089.14] it's called the corners go out or something it folds in two spots oh so it's like a 12-inch tablet
[1089.14 → 1095.38] like a big old tablet like one of the like the big iPad pros yeah yeah, but it folds twice with no
[1095.38 → 1100.58] display on the outside it's kind of nice so it's like kind of Percival you know yeah yeah and I was
[1100.58 → 1109.38] a Percival tablet that gets big totally makes sense yeah and for me, I actually preferred the idea of
[1109.38 → 1116.98] having it fold up and be protected compared to the idea of like it having this no I agree presumably
[1116.98 → 1123.22] somewhat fragile rolling mechanism that takes a while it should be noted though that it doesn't take that
[1123.22 → 1130.42] long those are motorized demo units that make sense but what's really cool is that jams who I was
[1130.42 → 1137.70] kind of envious of this as far as I can tell other than Samsung display employees jams strive was the
[1137.70 → 1141.94] only person who was allowed to touch all of these that's pretty cool so he got in there and was like
[1141.94 → 1149.14] right right like they're they're manual the demos that you see are just motors so they're
[1149.14 → 1153.38] set up to manual mechanisms and when you're doing a display like that you're going to want to make it
[1153.38 → 1156.82] go pretty slow because people are going to be interested in like intricate things that you want
[1156.82 → 1161.38] to see at slow speed so I don't blame them for doing any of that but in use you would just open it
[1161.38 → 1167.30] yeah which is pretty cool yeah yeah i do think I agree with you, I like the dual folding one a
[1167.30 → 1171.94] little bit better it feels like you're folding like a piece of paper or a map or something like that
[1171.94 → 1179.22] that yeah makes sense Tyler Colin one's first ever chat on twitch it's a grower not a shower yeah
[1180.50 → 1185.06] yeah that's a good first chat not always bad okay good first chat it gets bigger I swear um
[1186.50 → 1191.14] uh also that that's that's the last that's the last one not a small tab okay we're good for you to
[1191.14 → 1197.94] react to okay um but in other news it's a perfect thing that I didn't buy of the wall
[1197.94 → 1206.82] because there's now a smaller version of the wall um it's not exactly petite it's 76 inches
[1207.62 → 1218.42] it's cheaper and get this they'll do 240 hertz now they are much brighter and the is the big one
[1218.42 → 1227.78] the response time of this panel is apparently two nanoseconds whoa two nanoseconds
[1227.94 → 1235.70] for comparison you know it's fun when you move to a new unit of measurement you moved past we went
[1235.70 → 1241.54] from milliseconds to what I mean what's 0.1 of a millisecond I think that's what would
[1241.54 → 1248.98] that be yeah oh man i I'm pretty sure NATO is under micro I think we went past an entire
[1248.98 → 1257.70] what order of magnitude just skipped over it the fact that the fact that olds like high-en doled
[1257.70 → 1265.94] displays now are rated for like 0.1 milliseconds and this is two nanoseconds means that essentially
[1266.82 → 1276.74] image uh image retention or like image blur is solved at this point like if you could put a micro led
[1276.74 → 1283.70] display in something like a VR headset you would have absolutely no smearing whatsoever now obviously
[1283.70 → 1288.98] the fact that they're only able to make this in like a 76-inch form factor means we're not getting
[1288.98 → 1296.58] VR headsets anytime soon yeah, yeah one uh one fun thing when you in the audience because I think i
[1296.58 → 1304.10] think I am too old for this when you in the audience turn 31.7 years old uh you can say that you are
[1304.10 → 1310.90] one gig second old and that's apparently real oh okay thank you for that Luke yeah no worries i
[1310.90 → 1316.10] appreciate you it's like a ton of seconds, but it's a gig no it's a gig of seconds it's not a ton
[1317.06 → 1319.46] measure of mass that makes sense yeah, yeah good
[1322.26 → 1328.26] okay uh you guys are probably noticing if you are a new viewer there's little messages coming down in
[1328.26 → 1333.38] the bottom the way to send a message into the show is not through super chats it is not through twitch bits
[1333.38 → 1338.58] it is by either being subscribed on float plane we do actually monitor the float plane chat more
[1338.58 → 1344.42] closely or by sending in a merch message that's right instead of just throwing money at the screen
[1344.42 → 1350.66] you can throw money at the screen and get some cool stuff in the mail whether it's a t-shirt or a cool
[1350.66 → 1357.70] hoodie or a screwdriver it'll arrive eventually I swear it um a water bottle ltdstore.com is the place to go
[1357.70 → 1362.18] and in the checkout you can leave a merch message which will either show up along the bottom uh get a response from
[1362.18 → 1367.38] uh get a response from our producer Dan, or we might even talk about whatever it is that you said
[1367.38 → 1374.74] on the show uh sup Hayden f just yeah shouting out picked up the backpack very nice backpack reviews so
[1374.74 → 1379.38] good yeah so yeah it's moving real good people are loving it speaking of monetization
[1380.02 → 1387.62] wizards of the coast titans DND open gaming license angering community I think angering community is a bit
[1387.62 → 1391.94] of an understatement but yeah sure mild understatement this is not a community that tends to
[1391.94 → 1399.22] uh be big on anger or know how to combat things or write very well so I'm sure this won't be
[1399.22 → 1404.82] terrible for them a leaked version of wizards of the coast new open gaming license revision for dungeons
[1404.82 → 1411.14] and dragons is causing massive customer backlash luckily it's leaked not just customers to fix it massive
[1411.14 → 1416.50] backlash from everyone yeah because it's terrible uh the new revision demands that
[1416.50 → 1422.50] anyone making money really feel that anyone making money from DND to directly report it to wizards of the
[1422.50 → 1431.78] coast and potentially pay a 25 percent royalty on gross revenue okay that's important that last bit is
[1431.78 → 1440.74] really important I think that many people do not really um maybe they just don't really think about
[1440.74 → 1448.10] all the different terms that businesses use to describe money okay so for example um I mentioned on a
[1448.10 → 1458.10] recent wan show that this year uh 2023 could be the first year that merch outpaces uh video production
[1458.10 → 1464.90] for Linus media group or whatever the know Ivan umbrella corporation but for our revenue that does
[1464.90 → 1470.82] not mean and I've seen a lot of people that have sort of misconstrued that to mean that merch is more
[1470.82 → 1478.82] profitable that ain't the case physical goods have much higher overhead expenses you have to ship it around
[1478.82 → 1486.34] you have to make it you have to r d it Ada Ada Ada revenue is a measure of the sheer top line number
[1486.34 → 1494.58] of dollars that come into your company, but there are there are a few different places where
[1494.58 → 1502.26] revenue gets kind of cut down to become the actual amount left at the end uh so let's start first with
[1502.26 → 1511.22] that your with your cogs your like your cost of goods sold okay so when I bring in 70 of revenue
[1511.22 → 1519.14] on a screwdriver I then get to subtract the actual cost of my screwdriver so now I'm left with
[1519.14 → 1529.14] my gross profit not gross like you icky but gross like um not the opposite of net yeah, yeah okay so
[1529.14 → 1535.46] I'm left with my gross profit so that's essentially the amount of money minus the cost of goods sold but
[1535.46 → 1542.98] my costs aren't done yet to calculate my net profit okay the amount that I actually made on the
[1542.98 → 1548.98] screwdriver I then need to subtract any associated costs so we have to pack this thing somebody has to
[1548.98 → 1554.34] do that they need to be paid we have to put it in a box that costs money whoever made the box has to be
[1554.34 → 1561.78] paid um there's going to be some there's going to be QC uh there's also going to be some general overhead
[1561.78 → 1565.86] that's not necessarily associated with just this screwdriver but with screwdrivers in general we
[1565.86 → 1570.74] might have some bad units once in a while we need to send out replacement units via the trust me bro
[1570.74 → 1576.90] guarantee r d there's the r d that gets to be amortized but certainly has to be paid for at some
[1576.90 → 1584.66] point so then we get to our net profit then when we're done with that um now I'm going to get a little
[1584.66 → 1588.50] bit fuzzy on the terms because I don't believe it or not actually work in our accounting department
[1588.50 → 1593.54] and we have to pay taxes on that profit and that's where we're left with I forget if it's like
[1593.54 → 1598.50] earnings or like whatever net earnings or whatever the actual difference is so don't worry
[1598.50 → 1601.86] too much about the terms the point is you've got your revenue you've got your growth profit you've
[1601.86 → 1608.90] got your uh your profit after you account for uh paying salaries and uh operating costs electricity for
[1608.90 → 1614.42] you're building and all that other stuff and then finally on that number that amount that was left
[1614.42 → 1620.90] over in your bank account you then get to write a big fat check to uncle Trudeau and then that's
[1620.90 → 1625.62] the money that you actually get to keep sort of because that's your court we've played corporate
[1625.62 → 1630.02] income tax on that but if I wanted to actually spend it I would then have to pay personal income tax
[1630.02 → 1638.74] on it after I issued a dividend to myself or whatever the case may be okay cool so 25 royalty let's
[1638.74 → 1647.30] come back to wizards of the coast is on gross revenues that's why this is so nasty because it
[1647.30 → 1652.74] doesn't matter if you made any money even so you might have lost money and then need to give them they
[1652.74 → 1661.62] will take their cut and really and so say you didn't make money on it say you lost money on it and
[1661.62 → 1669.62] then they came gave you the finger and took 25 of the original amount anyway and that also gives
[1669.62 → 1675.78] them free rein to use those works in any way they see fit without compensating in perpetuity in any
[1675.78 → 1683.86] way forever, and they can even sublicense it heck yeah really the previous version of the license was
[1683.86 → 1690.18] in place for more than 20 years and allowed broad royalty-free use of DND's game mechanics and helped
[1690.18 → 1696.42] the tabletop RPGs grow into the 2.5 million dollar industry that they are today I actually bet you if
[1696.42 → 1702.34] that wasn't in place for the 20 years that it was in place they wouldn't be anywhere near the size of
[1702.34 → 1706.90] company that they are now um and I don't think it would be anywhere near as ubiquitous as it is now
[1706.90 → 1713.86] either yeah the previous very uh sorry the new version does not allow for anything beyond game books and
[1713.86 → 1720.82] PDFs this eliminates videos virtual tabletop implementations kind of huge computer games
[1720.82 → 1727.78] also kind of huge novels apps graphic novels music and any other form of media from being created with
[1727.78 → 1736.42] the IP here's the really wild thing to me um the old license was perpetual
[1736.42 → 1745.54] so the new license um Luke and I think both read up on this before coming into the show the
[1745.54 → 1752.34] new license specifically has language in it that allows them to alter the deal at any point pray I don't
[1752.34 → 1758.74] alter it further, but the old one didn't I suspect if you created something already using the old license
[1758.74 → 1764.02] that you're probably still fine yeah but like i have to imagine that are they just are they just
[1764.02 → 1768.98] anticipating that nobody will have the money or time to challenge them on this because the
[1768.98 → 1773.38] original usually how these things work the original timeline for this had it going into effect in like
[1773.38 → 1780.26] two days from now or something like that like these people were basically being given no time to agree
[1780.90 → 1787.54] comply and move forward with these new license terms which is wild you've gone, and you've built this
[1787.54 → 1795.38] ecosystem that is thriving you're clearly doing fine okay wizards of the coast brought in almost a billion
[1795.38 → 1803.14] dollars of revenue last year that is more than a third of the industry's revenue you are fine you have
[1803.14 → 1811.94] this openness to thank for your growth and now what some bean counter who I promise has never even
[1811.94 → 1819.06] touched DND has no idea how important third-party contributions are to the ecosystem came in and
[1819.06 → 1829.22] said well why not no we should get money from this yeah why not brutal meanwhile Hasbro and wizards of
[1829.22 → 1833.78] the coast are already dealing with significant backlash from the magic the gathering community over
[1833.78 → 1839.62] over printing cards Bank of America devalued the stock last month after their research analyst came to
[1839.62 → 1847.62] the conclusion that the over printing was destroying the long-term value of the mtg brand yikes this
[1847.62 → 1854.34] ain't going to help guys your brand is everything people don't have to play Dungeons and Dragons do you know
[1854.34 → 1860.98] how many games there are to play do you know how tabletop games do you know how passionate the tabletop
[1860.98 → 1869.14] gaming community is yeah they'll make a new one, and they can trust me they can like do you know how
[1869.14 → 1877.78] easy it is to make a definitely not dungeons and definitely not dragons game it's a die fantasy game
[1878.66 → 1889.06] it's like elves, and you didn't invent that for real though yeah like really yeah do you have any idea
[1889.06 → 1897.38] what you're doing I'm not even hyper into DND but I'm still looking at this going this is classic this is
[1897.38 → 1905.78] classic having absolutely no idea out of touch parent company absolutely no idea what you're doing yeah
[1905.78 → 1911.86] yeah yeah this is great we're getting lots of suggestions here uh we've got caves and lizards jails and
[1911.86 → 1922.34] wyverns huts and lizards this is what I'm talking this is what I'm talking about right now this 25
[1922.34 → 1927.30] is a great royalty okay wizards of the coast estimates that only about 20 companies will be
[1927.30 → 1933.46] affected by it and from their point of view why should they be essentially funding competitors
[1934.10 → 1941.46] but that's the thing is again you're you are missing the forest for the trees here I had never heard of
[1941.46 → 1947.62] any of those other companies until this headline hit my Google News feed and that's what I was kind of
[1947.62 → 1954.34] referencing near the beginning is like all I knew was Dungeons and Dragons DND is the is the big
[1954.34 → 1961.86] game in the space yeah you're the Kleenex yeah so why are you coming out and starting a media war
[1961.86 → 1969.06] a community war in front of everybody with every other brand of nose tissue all you're doing is like
[1969.06 → 1973.86] expo to use terms that maybe someone in your community might understand but I suspect you won't
[1973.86 → 1979.70] you're exposing part of your armour and allowing another smaller group to take a massive shot
[1979.70 → 1985.30] because like if somebody if somebody in this community that makes a perfect compelling
[1985.30 → 1992.66] product which there are genuinely many um just uses this to get a massive leg up it's very likely going
[1992.66 → 2000.66] to work like you're going to get wrecked because there are other very compelling products but right now or
[2000.66 → 2006.58] before today I guess if someone is really into DND, and they play for a really long time they might
[2006.58 → 2013.14] keep playing DND, or maybe they go and play one of these other things right okay well they're still in
[2013.14 → 2019.30] that community and that person is still bringing interest from other people in their sphere into these
[2019.30 → 2025.14] types of things and I find no get out of here I do not want to restart right now obviously um this
[2025.14 → 2030.18] computer is on for one day a week all right I'm using it for one day a week it's actually on for longer
[2030.18 → 2035.46] than that um anyway they're bringing more people into the space and a lot of people when they come
[2035.46 → 2043.78] into the tabletop RPG space are going to default to DND of course they are they're not going to default
[2043.78 → 2050.34] to one of these other games because they've heard this forever armour and shot no I was using I was
[2050.34 → 2057.22] talking about expose armour Emilia sin float plane chat says it was very, very clear from the leaks
[2057.22 → 2063.54] um that wizards of the coast has already knows to expect backlash, and they're just accepting
[2063.54 → 2067.62] that as cost of doing business I can't even imagine this is going to be a significant amount of money
[2068.42 → 2077.30] uh it could be it could be because that 25 percent tier is at 750 000 of revenue per year
[2077.30 → 2082.82] and so if there's 20 of them well that's at least 15 million dollars so you could take 25 of 15 million
[2082.82 → 2087.14] dollars it wouldn't hurt but then again we're talking about at the scale of their business like
[2087.14 → 2092.66] why, and they're creating so much administrative red tape yeah for what like everyone's expected to
[2092.66 → 2097.30] report their projects in to wizards of the coast someone has to review all that remember we were
[2097.30 → 2101.46] talking about those financial breakdown things yeah now you have to factor in the revenue loss that
[2101.46 → 2105.78] they're going to have and I guarantee you they're going to have it this is a very passionate community
[2105.78 → 2110.50] and they are not going to like this so they're going to switch to other games and some of these
[2110.50 → 2115.22] other games or platforms they included like music whatever else some of these other things various
[2115.22 → 2121.86] forms of implementation they can pivot assuming that their previous works fall under the original
[2121.86 → 2128.50] license so they're still fine new works can pivot Tommy blue uh clarified something yes sorry I'm sorry
[2129.22 → 2138.10] if you are doing 750 plus uh 750 000 plus revenue it's 25 on anything past that so it's kind of like an um
[2139.06 → 2144.58] bloody hell I forget the word um like it's kind of like how tax brackets work so yes you're in the
[2144.58 → 2149.14] higher bracket but that bracket only applies to your personal income over whatever level someone in chat is
[2149.14 → 2157.22] talking about using uh ChatGPT to alter how DND works to make a new game like yeah I don't know if you're
[2157.22 → 2163.46] make if you're making stuff in this space and your company uh if your company's revenue is over 750
[2163.46 → 2169.06] grand, and you're making something in this space first off good job second off I pivot find a way
[2169.06 → 2174.50] I'm sure you can do it screw these guys don't give them that 25 by the way I took some fun ones from
[2174.50 → 2179.62] float planes some potential names for DND competitors okay uh we've got swamps and donkey
[2179.62 → 2190.18] uh we've got planes and snakes nice okay um basements and virgins that that could be an actual game
[2190.18 → 2196.26] uh yeah I know right that could actually totally be an actual game but like the adventure is like
[2196.26 → 2200.42] getting out of the basement yeah trying to accomplish your fairly obvious task
[2200.42 → 2210.58] there are various ways to do so I mean wasn't that just terrible yeah basically exactly there's a
[2210.58 → 2213.94] compelling story here you could make that game coming of age
[2219.86 → 2220.98] that's the expansion
[2220.98 → 2231.94] and then the so to round out the trilogy we've got fun for the whole family oh no what no because
[2231.94 → 2240.26] because you've had children where did you go with that disgusting get your mind out of the
[2240.26 → 2242.98] gutters sir get out of the gutter step bro uh
[2242.98 → 2243.70] uh
[2249.06 → 2251.94] no that's the fourth one oh there you go okay yeah yeah yeah
[2255.54 → 2264.42] all right um cool oh man anyway uh we do not support this yeah if you didn't gather that
[2266.26 → 2271.70] okay apparently our discussion question here was how could Hasbro monetize two of the most lucrative
[2271.70 → 2277.62] brands in the gaming world without completely alienating their users uh I mean I can tell
[2277.62 → 2282.98] you right now that all the references to NFTs in the new guidelines are not going to help
[2284.18 → 2290.66] yeah oh you're a little late to the grift guys yeah a little bit there are tons of ways I don't know
[2291.62 → 2297.30] yeah anyway uh I always found that their games were very uh half-assed
[2297.30 → 2303.78] like the DND video games were never really that great I remember the first time I ever heard that
[2303.78 → 2309.22] there was a DND video game I actually got really excited, and then it was junk and I was like oh yeah
[2309.22 → 2315.38] I mean you don't actually have to make it the third party ones have been by far the better
[2315.38 → 2320.18] respected ones yeah we're talking about like never winter nights or uh something that is less
[2320.18 → 2326.50] directly uh you know d and d e never winter nights was like legendary um balder's gate I believe
[2326.50 → 2330.10] started like that as well yeah it was before yeah winter nights like there's quite a few that
[2330.10 → 2335.06] were done way better yeah so clearly it's possible yeah but I don't mean knights of the old republic
[2335.06 → 2341.62] another legendary game no absolutely not a first party game a lot of OG video games were actually
[2341.62 → 2346.82] based on d and d like systems um every winter nights is technically a d and d game oh I didn't
[2346.82 → 2352.66] actually know that yeah is it d and d though like was it first party because if so then what
[2352.66 → 2360.90] happened like for real though this bug is just like chilling with me for the whole show apparently
[2360.90 → 2368.18] Balder's gate 3 is coming yeah, but it's made by um the people that
[2368.18 → 2377.38] are we saying that as a plus for wizards of the coast because balder gate 3 is made by the company
[2377.38 → 2381.94] that made another game that I can't remember right now that is really really perfect and I'm
[2381.94 → 2387.70] expecting dragon age or uh Balder's gate 3 is going to be fantastic uh Marian studios yes Marian studios
[2388.90 → 2393.38] ah what's the name of it the most previous game that they made was Fanta divinity original sin 2.
[2393.38 → 2398.42] it's perfect it's made by Marian studios it's a fantastic game so i I have really high hopes for
[2398.42 → 2406.26] brawl the brothers gate 3. like very, very high hopes all right let's hope for the best I have I
[2406.26 → 2412.58] have an on record I have the soundtrack for the original sin 2 signed by the whole dev team
[2412.58 → 2417.38] not the whole dev team but a bunch of the dev team because at pax east the team was there so I brought
[2417.38 → 2421.30] the record and got them to sign it was pretty sweet that's very cool yeah yeah Luke's been trying to get
[2421.30 → 2426.82] me to play it we uh we've done it we started a co-op um campaign we've made it as far as the
[2426.82 → 2432.90] tutorial we got off the boat yeah we got off the boat and then stopped yeah if it was fun though
[2432.90 → 2437.78] yes we just don't always have a ton of time and we often want to play with your son, and it's a
[2437.78 → 2444.18] little yeah I don't think he'd be quite there yet for enjoying that it's two player so no I thought it
[2444.18 → 2449.86] was four oh, but we started a two-player game yeah so I think we'd have to make a new game I think
[2449.86 → 2455.46] yeah yeah and then expecting all three of those schedules to align I think is a little rough yeah
[2455.46 → 2460.58] the amount of divinity original sin 2 games that I have because of wanting to integrate a new person
[2460.58 → 2464.66] and they want to make their own character and stuff so you end up forking like a million times is
[2464.66 → 2470.98] is pretty crazy um but yeah fantastic game and as far as my understanding goes Marian is a fantastic
[2470.98 → 2475.94] studio so uh apparently yeah Balder's gate is officially licensed DND mind you that was a hot minute
[2475.94 → 2482.18] ago so hopefully that's going to change anyway in terms of ideas to monetize the IP clearly
[2482.18 → 2488.98] there are plenty, and they don't have to just the fact that alienate their players gate three, and it's
[2488.98 → 2496.42] being released now means they didn't take advantage of that yeah that's true like that's fair I don't know
[2496.42 → 2504.90] man I think there are lots of ways I'm also surprised has there been a movie g and d movie what would that
[2504.90 → 2512.26] even look like well like here's a yeah I don't know Dungeons and Dragons honour among thieves is
[2512.26 → 2514.26] apparently coming this year 23.
[2516.90 → 2525.94] hmm I could see this I could see it being great I could see it being terrible yeah yep I don't feel
[2525.94 → 2531.14] like it's going to land in the middle I think it's going to be atrocious or great well Hugh grant is in
[2531.14 → 2536.34] it is that a good thing or a bad thing I mean it's Hugh grant so um I'm not very good with like it
[2536.34 → 2540.50] depends if you like his sort of likeable awkwardness
[2544.18 → 2550.42] I feel like they need to kind of brush over that it's DND you know apparently there was a horrible one
[2550.82 → 2558.66] um oh in 2000 Dungeons and Dragons IMDB 2000 and I didn't even know about this
[2558.66 → 2564.26] well it has 3.6 stars out of 10 so it looks like you didn't really miss out on much yeah really
[2564.26 → 2569.06] but like the fact that I didn't know about it is rough at like 50 to 60 percent there's a chance
[2569.06 → 2577.14] that you'll just be like her dirt good movie uh at 36 of people liked it yeah the odds are not
[2577.14 → 2583.46] looking good yep um if you want the odds of your message appearing down there to be high you're going
[2583.46 → 2587.54] to want to send in a merch message Dan do you want to give us a couple, and then we'll yeah we'll try and do
[2587.54 → 2592.34] the rest of the curated merch messages towards the end of the show sure that sounds good
[2593.14 → 2598.82] um let's see I've got one here from Ashley uh buying a bottle for my friend's birthday at Linus
[2598.82 → 2605.22] how do you decide which videos go up on weekdays versus weekends depends when they're done
[2607.86 → 2613.86] nice and simple in a perfect world we'd actually love to come out with a banger on Saturday just
[2613.86 → 2621.62] because Friday's wan show and wan show doesn't like to perform the same way that a typical God does
[2621.62 → 2626.26] so we'd love to be able to come out strong just so that you know algorithmically we're sending
[2626.26 → 2633.70] signals that we don't upload you know two uh wet farts in a row uh I'm google claims up and down that
[2633.70 → 2641.46] that doesn't matter, but it like totally does um yeah uh okay everything at creator summit
[2641.46 → 2650.10] is confidential but I will just say YouTube says a lot of things and the experienced creators do not
[2650.10 → 2658.98] appreciate the way that YouTube tends to oversimplify how their algorithmic systems for deciding how a video
[2658.98 → 2666.74] is promoted work they are not simple, and you do kind of need to be a bit of a bit of a of a
[2666.74 → 2675.06] of a fortune-teller soothsayer tea-leaf reader to even sort of maybe hopefully understand how they work
[2675.06 → 2684.82] and they are not just like yeah good video get views quite anywho um yeah, but it doesn't usually work
[2684.82 → 2690.18] out that way though we do our best yeah and I got another one here from Jacob hi Linus and Luke do
[2690.18 → 2694.50] you guys think float plane will ever turn into a big streaming service for techies
[2696.02 → 2702.02] uh not in the way not like for techie it's not for techies um it's for everybody we have a lawyer on
[2702.02 → 2709.70] the platform well what's interesting is that the conversations that we've been having about new
[2709.70 → 2716.26] features and how float plane could be utilized I guess so could make it a hugely important video
[2716.26 → 2720.98] streaming service for techies we want to talk about that but not in the way you're thinking
[2720.98 → 2725.86] at all yeah sure why don't we talk about it yeah sure you're about uh you're about to listen in on
[2725.86 → 2731.38] our weekly float plane strategy and develop do we want to get do we want to talk about the thing
[2731.38 → 2739.62] um this thing lets's not talk about the that thing okay did you just go like this to me not quite okay
[2739.62 → 2742.10] there's more separation I guess I would have been able to tell yeah
[2745.30 → 2751.86] familiar um yeah there 's's some video features I'll just say it like that um that are
[2751.86 → 2756.66] are going to eventually be coming to the lab's website well we can talk about some basic ones like
[2756.66 → 2762.26] say for example like uh keyboard videos like what did Antoine want to do with the
[2762.26 → 2769.06] video player again yeah so basically like a video where you'd watch a key get pressed by the key
[2769.06 → 2777.14] presser um could be played on the site through by using float plane um basically having a YouTube
[2777.14 → 2784.58] embed would be cheap and I mean it would be free um and easy, but then we've all seen how that
[2784.58 → 2788.66] works where like you get the suggested videos being sent at the end of it, and it doesn't really
[2788.66 → 2792.58] fit in with the rest of the flow of the website you can maybe customize the player but the second
[2792.58 → 2796.26] video ends, and it spits out a bunch of suggested videos you know it's not really part of the
[2796.26 → 2801.54] site, and we might not want everything to be like a 16 by 9 aspect ratio we might want to
[2802.74 → 2808.66] we might want it and embedded a little more tightly with everything around it like there's a lot of
[2808.66 → 2812.74] reasons maybe use gifts and this doesn't exclude gifts, but there might be situations where we want
[2812.74 → 2817.94] people to be able to have uh more control over the actual video, or we might want to have our own
[2817.94 → 2823.14] player for whatever reason on it etc etc etc so yeah um there 's's potentially going to be flow plane
[2823.14 → 2828.18] integration extremely likely going to it's just not there yet let's just tell them about the cool
[2828.18 → 2833.78] feature you sure yeah let's just tell them this is like it's the kind of thing that obviously talking
[2833.78 → 2840.18] about it, you know 6 12 18 months before we're ready to launch is gonna potentially give someone a
[2840.18 → 2845.38] heads up but realistically like what who's going to compete with this who could be done this feature
[2845.38 → 2851.30] in 18 months other than us, I know if somebody could it would just be expensive well yeah, but that's what
[2851.30 → 2860.26] I mean you totally could yeah but um lots of things I doubt anyone will do it um so you know how hard it is
[2860.26 → 2870.34] to find any kind of credible answer to this versus that you know some GPU versus another GPU or some
[2870.34 → 2877.38] CPU versus another CPU sorry keep going I have something else to add to that but keep going sure
[2877.38 → 2884.98] I mean you usually end up on one of those websites that just kind of has a spec sheet that may or may not
[2884.98 → 2890.66] be accurate and maybe a little write-up uh but like it's like a generated write-up it's just it's
[2890.66 → 2897.46] just honestly not that useful um the solution to that up until now has been to search for it on YouTube
[2897.46 → 2903.70] and there's this entire genre of videos now this entire category of videos that's just gameplay
[2903.70 → 2910.26] captures with frame time information on it and stuff frame times clock speeds temperatures overlaid
[2910.26 → 2916.10] so that you can see the different products running next to each other the issue is that someone has to
[2916.10 → 2922.10] go capture that gameplay footage specifically for that video they have to stitch it together they have
[2922.10 → 2925.46] to encode it they have to upload it to YouTube they have to title it, and you have to find it
[2926.34 → 2932.34] well what if on the lab's website we had a comparison engine that gave you the specs obviously so you so
[2932.34 → 2937.70] you could compare the specs the know architecture clock speed you know kudu cores or whatever else
[2937.70 → 2944.42] the case may be but where you could also dynamically generate side-by-side video of whatever games you
[2944.42 → 2949.86] want to see of whatever cards you want to see, and we had a custom player that could play them back so
[2949.86 → 2955.38] that you could really see the difference in gameplay experience like stitch it into one player so that
[2955.38 → 2963.14] it's a good experience and whatnot um that's what we're building Dan from the labs web the Dan the
[2963.14 → 2968.82] lead of the labs web team ran a meeting today that was actually super cool we've done this with
[2968.82 → 2973.30] flow plane before uh, but it was essentially like a site walkthrough where you sit the team down you go
[2973.30 → 2977.30] through the website, and you get feedback from everybody about like how something feels does this
[2977.30 → 2981.78] work in the way we want it to should we change this thing whatever you go through the whole website and do
[2981.78 → 2986.90] that um and there were some really, really good things that came from that actually some perfect
[2986.90 → 2992.82] feedback from the team um and he's going to throw it to some other people as well including the labs local team
[2993.14 → 2997.94] and flow plane and stuff like that just trying to sharpen it up a little bit before we send it out
[2997.94 → 3003.14] um and there was some really cool ideas that came from that the only one I'm going to spit out was one of
[3003.14 → 3008.58] mine um which was we decided that we were going to change how you know the compare tool you press the
[3008.58 → 3014.82] button to add it to your cart yep we had another kind of like floating uh little module on the side that
[3014.82 → 3020.26] kind of did that as well, but it was a little bit redundant and just a little bit odd so we were talking about
[3020.26 → 3027.46] removing it and um I came up with the idea of because someone else worded I think it was damned
[3027.46 → 3034.82] I don't remember who someone else worded it in a way that gave me this idea um oh right it was like
[3035.54 → 3039.86] the I think the way that it was originally described was oh we could just like to put some other products
[3039.86 → 3045.22] there and people could choose to compare those as well and I was like okay but what if it works in a
[3045.22 → 3052.42] similar way to the Amazon like frequently purchased with section or so we did like one they used to
[3052.42 → 3058.58] have people who looked at this usually ended up going with this so it'd be similar to that type of
[3058.58 → 3063.70] engine so now it would be like this is often compared with these things so if you're looking
[3063.70 → 3068.42] at a specific say graphics card it could be like well this graphics card is often compared with these
[3068.42 → 3072.66] so if you hear of some graphics card from your friend, and you're technical enough to know about the
[3072.66 → 3078.50] labs website yeah, but maybe you're not so into gaming performance so you're not super technical
[3078.50 → 3082.82] in the way of understanding GPUs and their performance and all the different range of
[3082.82 → 3087.14] possible ones there are out there, and you look up this graphics card yeah you could see oh or maybe
[3087.14 → 3092.26] headphones right yeah might I also suggest yeah maybe you should compare against these other ones as
[3092.26 → 3097.46] well because everyone else does so the labs local team doesn't have to like manually come up with these
[3097.46 → 3103.14] lists of suggested players it just happens fairly automatically so that's like a cool idea it'll take
[3103.14 → 3107.54] some time to build but absolutely super cool saying it's coming now I have no idea when we're going to
[3107.54 → 3113.30] work on it, we have lots of things to do guys there's so much potential here exactly depending on
[3113.30 → 3121.86] how much we can automate a lot of this capture um there is the potential, but this will not happen in the
[3121.86 → 3128.90] short term, but there's the potential that you could basically kind of preview you know whatever
[3128.90 → 3133.54] combination of hardware you're interested in obviously there'd be limitations right we're not
[3133.54 → 3142.74] going to go start throwing RTX 4090s on you know core 2 quad q6600s just for jollies so that people can
[3142.74 → 3149.94] play around with it, we would want to focus on things that are actually realistic but um the whole idea
[3149.94 → 3156.82] here is to not just generate this data not just generate these captures but make it more digestible
[3156.82 → 3162.82] I've got people asking would this be free some level of it will be free I can't promise that
[3162.82 → 3169.46] everything will be free if you're sitting there laying it on my face that was about to happen
[3169.46 → 3175.46] eventually like if you're is you're sitting there you know um running it to the point where we're
[3175.46 → 3179.86] looking at it going you know you're running a small business you're in here for like two hours a day
[3180.50 → 3185.14] every day configuring systems for people sucking up video bandwidth at some point you might just
[3185.14 → 3190.66] need a pro account so I don't know I don't know where that line is going to be I don't want to do
[3190.66 → 3196.42] it at all I'm just being transparent because like when Linus first suggested the side-by-side viewer
[3196.42 → 3200.74] thing which was the first idea of integrating he was like YouTube YouTube right yeah yeah I was like
[3200.74 → 3206.42] please these are unlisted videos on YouTube, and he was like nope I want to do it this way and I was like
[3206.42 → 3211.54] okay what if we did this other option he was like nope I want to do it this way I'm like okay cool
[3212.10 → 3218.98] no you're not, but this website doesn't have a ton of potential in its current form to make money and
[3218.98 → 3223.54] playing video costs a lot of money so what are we going to do bro
[3226.42 → 3231.38] buy screwdrivers and this was his answer and now I'm sitting here like okay I have to build this thing
[3231.38 → 3237.86] that's just going to saddle like a ton of cost, and it's its uh it's concerning so we're going to have to
[3237.86 → 3244.74] figure out at some point how we monetize it maybe you have access to certain levels of features maybe you
[3244.74 → 3250.66] can watch a certain amount of comparisons a day or a week or whatever I have no idea but just leaving
[3250.66 → 3255.94] it fully uncorked all the time when we don't want to be super annoying or aggressive with ads are we
[3255.94 → 3262.42] are we going to have any ads we don't want to say that right now I'm assuming, but they're not going to be
[3262.42 → 3266.82] like super annoying because he's going to want to use it so they can't be super annoying we'll almost
[3266.82 → 3274.50] certainly um aggressively pursue affiliate revenue yeah like that is one of the ideas yeah yeah yeah
[3274.50 → 3280.98] like if you are is you're ultimately sitting on our site to make a purchase decision then we want
[3280.98 → 3289.46] a piece of that because if you think about it who did the work Amazon or us if you buy ultimately
[3289.46 → 3295.14] whatever it is that you buy did the brand do the work now did the retailer do the work no what does it
[3295.14 → 3299.86] need to work what is it called when you're a retail employee and you get a certain amount of money
[3299.86 → 3304.18] for the amount of products that commission yeah it's effectively commission yeah or like a
[3304.18 → 3310.34] stiff or whatever you want to call it like that's that's that's something that we would absolutely
[3310.34 → 3318.02] pursue now what I can commit now is that that suggestion engine for example that Luke is talking
[3318.02 → 3326.74] about will not prefer items that we get better commissions on yeah that is my 100 promise
[3326.74 → 3331.62] to you, it would be purely based on in perpetuity genuinely what things people compare the thing you're
[3331.62 → 3337.06] looking at with because it's one of those things that makes me so angry about Amazon that's why
[3337.06 → 3344.74] that went away that's why that makes sense, and it was the only thing I used to shop it their site is
[3344.74 → 3350.58] utterly unnavigable now I don't know if that's a word and I don't care the point is that that was how
[3350.58 → 3354.98] I shopped because already their site was impossible to navigate so if I could find something that was
[3354.98 → 3362.90] approximately what I'm looking for then that carousel that had people who viewed this usually bought this
[3363.78 → 3371.06] what was how I found things like almost every time and so that's what I want to bring back I want us to
[3371.06 → 3379.62] be able to have you show up on some piece of pair of headphones have a little thing that pops up and says
[3379.62 → 3388.18] hey um couldn't help noticing you're looking at AirPods Max would you consider perhaps something that
[3388.18 → 3396.74] is not heavy and that sounds better yeah basically though so i I think that's really cool I would have
[3396.74 → 3401.06] never thought about that if I wasn't prompted by uh whoever on the team said I think it was Dan again
[3401.06 → 3405.70] um and there was a lot of others actually really cool things that came out of that meeting so I'm quite
[3405.70 → 3412.02] excited um but yeah float plane is going to be involved with the labs' website in some way it
[3412.02 → 3416.58] seems kind of inevitable now because he just says no we're doing it every time I try to bring
[3416.58 → 3422.50] up alternatives here's the thing like what's the point of being vertically integrated no yeah I get
[3422.50 → 3428.50] it my only concern is cost we have media production media playback testing, and we've got this
[3428.50 → 3436.10] site that needs what test data yeah okay media production and media playback well okay maybe I'll
[3436.10 → 3442.34] use some other media playback so no I'm not going to do that no it's its an it's an it's a great solution
[3442.34 → 3447.22] it's going to end up being very good technically the only concerns that I have are on the business
[3447.22 → 3451.86] side and there were some ideas of like maybe the feature is entirely locked behind a flow plane
[3451.86 → 3456.74] subscription, and we just make it so you can subscribe to flow plane uh or the line of sec tips flow plane
[3456.74 → 3462.74] uh through the lab's website absolutely or whatever like almost certainly happen is a more
[3462.74 → 3469.22] all-you-can-eat float plane subscription that also includes some kind of perks on the lab's website i
[3469.22 → 3476.26] think that we're going to see some kind of rejuvenation of Linus tech tips.com the forum um you know where
[3476.26 → 3482.90] there will be certain privileges that are granted from that float plane subscription so the more value that
[3482.90 → 3490.18] we can add to a float plane subscription ultimately I think the more this whole thing will make sense
[3490.18 → 3496.42] if we're is we're talking about theoretical features that might never exist um another idea of integrating
[3496.42 → 3501.78] forum stuff is there's been thoughts where the comments if we decided to do comments there are no
[3501.78 → 3506.58] comments right now this might never be a thing there might never be comments at all like don't
[3506.58 → 3513.54] take this too far but if we decide to do comments okay Luke if we decide to do comments they could be
[3513.54 → 3520.66] integrated in a way where it's really just the forum and the posts on if it's just a thread forum posts
[3520.66 → 3525.46] it's just a thread yeah it's, and it's this that is then integrated into the lab's website so it's
[3525.46 → 3531.46] viewable on both etc etc etc, and it might just be this like mesh of websites that form into because that'll
[3531.46 → 3538.66] help with the forum's SEO um so it'll, it'll like to drive up activity um it will, it just add more user
[3538.66 → 3543.38] generated content to the forum which again is also good for SEO not like the forum's ever going to make
[3543.38 → 3553.38] money but like but if the development we do on the forum can enhance and enrich the experience on the
[3553.38 → 3559.86] lab's website well then all of a sudden it has a reason for existing no for real the forum
[3559.86 → 3566.34] exists it celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week pretty exciting I saw that someone changed the
[3566.34 → 3572.90] banner at the top to the OG Linus tech tips uh logo was that you no actually okay it was probably
[3572.90 → 3577.94] Morris or something yeah anyway uh, so the forum celebrated its 10-year anniversary and the forum
[3577.94 → 3585.70] exists because of the same reason that it has always existed it exists as a desperation backup plan
[3585.70 → 3592.66] somewhere where our community can be that no one can ever take away from us uh and number two because
[3592.66 → 3597.38] I just thought it should, and it's its caught us in its net before like it is it has saved us before
[3598.02 → 3602.74] absolutely and when it's its like infrastructure right when it's working just fine, and you don't
[3602.74 → 3608.98] need if you're like oh yeah why do we have this thing why don't we keep throwing money at this when
[3608.98 → 3616.18] you need it suddenly, and you're like when vessel goes out of business suddenly, and you need somewhere
[3616.18 → 3621.94] to post your early access videos and some way to collect money from people to get them you're like
[3621.94 → 3631.22] oh yeah we've got a forum let's go yeah yeah anyway I don't know how the heck we got to that
[3632.02 → 3636.42] what topic were we on don't even worry about it is it a merch message I think so I feel like I just like
[3636.42 → 3643.70] like came out of a haze the point is we're really excited yeah yeah there are so many cool directions
[3643.70 → 3649.38] we can take it in yeah and uh we've had a good year team's really driven they're killing it we had a
[3649.38 → 3657.94] good year um we're hiring we're building it like let's let's go I've I've seen I've seen a ton of
[3657.94 → 3665.46] speculation it's hilarious because we're so transparent like who else but us would put an
[3665.46 → 3675.06] actual sales counter on the product page for their two biggest launches of the year we are so like
[3675.06 → 3682.34] painfully transparent I was I did flag that when we were making that feature but yeah i know um
[3682.34 → 3688.10] and that the amount of speculation that I see that oh Linus is overextending himself on the lab
[3688.10 → 3693.78] I'm not going to be able to do that but I don't know what's going to do with the other people
[3693.78 → 3698.18] we're fine yeah I'm fine he's fine yeah everyone is fine yep

[3936.18 → 3943.70] do we have a Lt store deal of the week nick is travelling um and I don't know if he has like cover
[3943.70 → 3954.82] so oh well we have a new shirt hey the Henley shirt look at this stylish shirt uh
[3955.78 → 3963.30] oh okay that's cute weird picture but yes Henley shirt let's go here's a bunch of people wearing it
[3963.94 → 3970.26] here's it being nice and soft and super nice here is um no real product information other than the
[3970.26 → 3976.34] materials it's made of because it's everyone's travelling don't worry too much about that
[3976.34 → 3980.98] but yeah it's its super nice hey do we have any reviews on the pajama pants yet from last week
[3981.78 → 3988.66] i kind of doubt it i kind of doubt it yeah people we don't send out a notification to leave a review
[3988.66 → 3993.22] for like a month or something like that so after we launch something there's like a month and then
[3993.22 → 3997.94] there's like this flood of reviews yeah I was going to say they would need to have it and then have had it for
[3997.94 → 4005.46] enough time to actually formulate a good review so yeah uh speaking of the store let's talk about your
[4005.46 → 4012.42] junk um you're doing an underwear photo shoot yeah so we have new patterns for the underwear the only
[4012.42 → 4016.02] reason that I put this in the doc was because we were talking about it, but then we never finished our
[4016.02 → 4023.38] conversation oh so uh nick gave me a three-week warning that we have new underwear patterns coming
[4023.38 → 4033.14] so since he told me I have done some form of workout every day nice uh my goal is to have
[4035.38 → 4044.42] no uh like softening layer like I okay like I have like I have abs like you can see them
[4044.42 → 4050.82] but I want to not have I think I can tell I want to I think your abs have more bulk than they normally do
[4050.82 → 4057.14] so because you've always been pretty cut but I don't think I've seen that much bulk in your abs
[4057.14 → 4065.06] before so I make sense well that's because almost everything I do is cardio yeah normally yeah so I'm
[4065.06 → 4073.30] I'm doing just like some not cardio nothing, nothing crazy but a little bit of anything other than cardio
[4073.30 → 4078.42] and also a lot of cardio so you guys have probably noticed if you're on float plane that I've been
[4078.42 → 4086.18] streaming beat safer more lately ain't an accident um gotcha trying to trying to get rid of
[4086.18 → 4093.94] trying to get rid of some of that so yep, yep now I know you've been working out a lot lately yeah i I've
[4093.94 → 4101.30] been working out um okay so I said six days a week because I didn't fully explain it uh so I do something
[4101.30 → 4109.54] that contributes to physical health seven days a week I work out six days a week okay on Tuesdays I do
[4110.10 → 4117.30] uh rotating cold and heat exposure for an hour and 15 you're going to have to explain what rotating
[4117.30 → 4125.14] cold and heat exposure so i so you like light a fire and then you just so I don't have the fridge over
[4125.14 → 4129.46] here and a fireplace here yeah that'd actually be fascinating I don't think that would work
[4129.46 → 4136.02] very well but um i I do an ice bath for five minutes oh what ice bath and then I drip-dry for
[4136.02 → 4144.18] a minute and a half and then I do uh I don't have a sauna, so a simulated sauna for 20 minutes okay and
[4144.18 → 4151.30] then ice bath for five drip-dry one and a half sauna for 20. I basically do that rotation of three things
[4151.30 → 4156.98] three times that sounds awful it is I won't do it yeah that's fine I don't care how badly I need it i
[4156.98 → 4163.22] will not do that and then every other day of the week I do some form of workout so um today is sprints
[4163.94 → 4171.70] okay you know what I will do and I'm not sure that you would let me just say this do you know what an
[4171.70 → 4177.78] emulator is that the stair master machine nope that's an elliptical okay no okay
[4177.78 → 4186.58] it's no, no no, no I'll explain if it's okay there there 's's stuff that I'm working on that is
[4186.58 → 4197.38] more than just the physique because i not a huge body hair fan okay let me put it this way the line between
[4197.38 → 4206.18] feminine um like uh beauty products and actual torture devices
[4207.38 → 4215.38] is truly a thin one indeed some of them are terrifying yeah oh yeah an emulator is a hair removal tool
[4215.38 → 4224.34] that's like an auto plucker so it's kind of like a motorized razor oh, but it has a spinning thing that
[4224.34 → 4230.82] has these wires that narrow so that when the hair gets caught in the wire it rips it out so it
[4230.82 → 4236.34] literally just rips all your hair it literally just rips out your hair as you run it across your body
[4237.14 → 4246.90] I would deeply prefer to do hot and cold exposure that sounds atrociously horrible um wow um
[4246.90 → 4254.02] wow it's really painful yeah as you might as you might expect you've already done this i yeah
[4254.02 → 4258.42] well I've tried it because I'm just like what is the best way what is the best way to do this
[4258.42 → 4263.78] so is your plan to do this just before the photo shoot is your plan to like to keep this up so I will
[4263.78 → 4272.26] say this once you've once you've kind of gotten everything once it's way easier okay it is it's like so
[4272.26 → 4278.74] many things in life it's a hundred times easier to keep up than it is to catch up wow um
[4280.58 → 4289.38] yeah wow it's its very it's very painful um that's rough oh what like um not to be way too specific
[4289.38 → 4296.10] yeah where do you do this is this just like a chest like an uh torso like chest like around the tummy
[4296.10 → 4304.18] yeah yeah my like my hair in my like tummy zone is coming in I thought for along my dad has like
[4304.18 → 4309.14] I used to joke and I'd like to slap my dad in the chest just be like killed all the forest animals because
[4312.58 → 4318.74] because he had like all this hair he's very hairy uh and even in my like late 20s I was like
[4319.30 → 4325.38] not going to be me must have got the genes from the other side of the family whatever and now my tummy i
[4325.86 → 4331.86] never really pay attention and I brushed it the other day and I was like yeah so when I met so long
[4331.86 → 4339.14] when I met Yvonne it was like oh a little treasure trail yeah, and now it's like thick above the belly
[4339.14 → 4344.82] treasure forest yeah, and it's like there with lynx adventure yeah and master sword and as soon as
[4344.82 → 4352.66] as soon as there's no clear bear patch between the chest and the tummy and the legs yeah it's like
[4352.66 → 4353.54] bit of a different look
[4357.62 → 4365.54] yeah yeah I'm very jealous of both of you're gel oh yeah well no he's a hairy dude oh my god
[4366.10 → 4373.62] oh yeah yeah okay and okay, okay, so people are bringing up laser uh I can afford laser not gonna
[4373.62 → 4381.46] not going to hide that um finding a place that'll do laser on men not easy really yeah I mean okay
[4381.46 → 4388.10] especially if it's like in an intimate area but the vast majority I don't want to do that that'd be
[4388.10 → 4393.14] horrible well anyway the point is that finding places that will even do any kind of like laser
[4393.14 → 4399.22] hair removal treatment on men is not that easy is there a reason they just don't want to weird well like
[4399.22 → 4405.62] like because I don't know men are gross i guess yeah for real I don't know uh is there is
[4405.62 → 4409.06] there any downsides of laser hair removal does it like mess with your sweat glands or anything like
[4409.06 → 4413.14] that no, no okay the downside is the cost, and you have to go back a lot of times, and it hurts
[4413.94 → 4418.58] like any hair I mean any hair removal hurts, so people have been saying air that's like that's
[4418.58 → 4425.22] it like dissolves the hair that also wow that creeps me out yeah honestly I'd rather the pain
[4425.22 → 4429.46] than put a chemical that dissolves hair all over my body like if is we were talking like
[4429.46 → 4434.90] your skin's an organ my dudes yeah if we were talking like oh i want it absorbs stuff i i i
[4434.90 → 4440.42] want to like uh oh man what would I even okay if we were talking like oh my stupid watch strap is
[4440.42 → 4444.42] always catching in my hair and I'm just going to do like a little patch around my wrist or something
[4444.42 → 4449.86] like that yeah I'd probably yeah I'd yeah I'd probably throw some air on their run the
[4449.86 → 4454.66] emulator in a circle around your yeah I think I would not do that yeah I think I would not do that um
[4455.54 → 4460.90] but if it's is it's like a significant chunk of your body I think I'd, I think I'd rather
[4462.34 → 4468.10] do it the natural way people are talking in float plane chat they're like lasers almost always done
[4468.10 → 4473.86] on women um so it's viewed as like a safe space or something like I don't know wouldn't it be a
[4473.86 → 4479.22] private room like what does that even mean they want to avoid harassment towards the staff I mean yeah
[4479.78 → 4484.82] I don't know sure I guess I don't know I just know that I called a couple places, and they were just
[4484.82 → 4489.38] nodded they were like I'm sorry I can tell by your voice we will not be working on you, I'm like okay
[4489.38 → 4495.38] really yeah yeah they were just like nope that doesn't seem fair well what if you just have a deep
[4495.38 → 4503.14] voice I mean they clarified obviously but I'm I'm I got you I got you I got you I got you basically
[4503.14 → 4510.26] they were immediately not interested in talking to me yeah um rough I might have somebody to recommend
[4510.26 → 4515.30] oh geek power says gay guys definitely get laser removal done I'd imagine there'd be a number of
[4515.30 → 4520.26] places in big city like Vancouver yeah I was probably just like calling the wrong places like if you go
[4520.26 → 4525.46] if you go somewhere that like specializes in you know that community or whatever else then I'm sure
[4526.10 → 4533.78] worked on guys before yeah that makes sense yeah, yeah anyway the point is that even legal
[4533.78 → 4542.74] epilating hurts yeah I imagine yeah yeah i I hate yeah I hate I've always disliked pulling hairs I don't
[4542.74 → 4547.70] know it just sucks I don't know, and it's very like localized and really sharp like it feels like a needle
[4547.70 → 4553.70] like I feel like when you get I don't know why different forms of pain despite even potentially
[4553.70 → 4559.38] being more like in quotes painful or easier to deal with yeah like this is the same guy that was it last
[4559.38 → 4563.54] week or the week before you were talking about oh no it was the worst videos video where you were
[4563.54 → 4568.02] talking about like getting someone to tackle you as hard as they could like that's actually whatever
[4568.02 → 4574.26] not a huge deal but like if I pluck one of like a pluck a mono I would literally rather that you tackled me
[4574.26 → 4580.42] yeah I get it yeah I get if it's just for some reason maybe it's totally mental, but it's just
[4580.42 → 4585.62] easier to deal with yep I don't know what it is or why or whatever, but it's just always been that way
[4586.34 → 4593.22] yeah well the heck this is the second time this show how did we get here I don't know where did we
[4593.22 → 4598.58] get here from oh right the modelling session okay that makes sense yeah so I'm going to be ready this time
[4598.58 → 4603.06] I'm going to be ready nice yeah are you trying to do anything because so I know you're
[4603.06 → 4607.70] trying to get more definition in the ab area a little more definition are you trying to do more
[4609.38 → 4614.74] you mentioned something about your chest I have no pecs I am three weeks is not a long time are you
[4614.74 → 4619.94] one week in so you have two weeks left yeah that's one of the reasons why at the roast me making flat
[4619.94 → 4625.22] chested jokes that my wife was like probably not that okay you know I'm flatter than her
[4625.22 → 4632.98] uh anyway the sorry what um like so are you not going to try to work on those areas beat safer
[4632.98 → 4636.90] actually helps a lot with that that makes sense yeah um there's a lot of it's not more shoulders
[4636.90 → 4641.94] it's not it doesn't help the way that like doing weights would it doesn't help bulk up, but it helps
[4641.94 → 4647.46] define it a bit more well this would help with pecs if you like did these right yeah I expected you
[4647.46 → 4651.62] most people would go with the bench but I don't know I don't know anything i you know I don't
[4651.62 → 4659.06] know how a weight room works I haven't I barely do I haven't oh shut up compared to me, it's so stop
[4659.06 → 4665.70] it's so no stop now it's so deep stop and that community is so critical it's crazy Luke let me
[4665.70 → 4671.62] put it this good reason in a lot of cases let me put it this way I haven't set foot in a weight room
[4671.62 → 4682.02] since grade 10. Not even set foot and in grade 10 i our school gave you options when you were doing
[4682.02 → 4691.30] the weight unit in pe you could do that or a sport I did one day and I switched over to the sport
[4691.30 → 4702.10] I have literally not even sat on a weight machine of any sort in over 20 years this is the first time
[4702.10 → 4707.70] so you and I have talked about this a bunch yeah one of my biggest problems for the last
[4707.70 → 4715.78] long time has been that I keep trying to work out and for certain reasons uh that I don't necessarily
[4715.78 → 4721.54] want to go way into but I end up injuring myself like every time it's like it's hard
[4721.54 → 4727.30] to watch honestly as yeah as I know I'm sure it is, and it's hard for me too like it's just it sucks
[4727.30 → 4732.26] so I get excited I get motivated and then I push too far I push too hard and I injure myself and
[4732.26 → 4737.30] there are reasons why that happens and I don't want to go into it, but it happens and then I get really
[4737.30 → 4744.98] discouraged and I get really uh like self-loathing and unhappy and lethargic and then i i I lose it
[4744.98 → 4749.62] because like oh I'll injure one specified area it's almost always one of the three things it's
[4749.62 → 4753.78] my lower back it's my right knee it's my right shoulder yeah like it's its always one of those
[4753.78 → 4757.94] things because those are pre-existing injuries from when I was growing up and I'll, I'll trigger
[4757.94 → 4763.46] one of them and even though I could work like if it's my knee okay sure you can do everything upper
[4763.46 → 4768.74] body who cares right but I'm just super discouraged because leg day is actually my favourite day I'm one of
[4768.74 → 4773.54] those weird people I love doing leg day so when leg day gets taken out of the rotation I'm like oh well
[4774.10 → 4777.62] it's hard to get motivated if it's my shoulder if it's my lower back I'm just kind of screwed but
[4777.62 → 4781.14] if it's my shoulder it's like okay well I could keep doing leg day but then I'm like okay
[4782.10 → 4787.46] but the upper body stuff is the stuff you actually get like credit for yeah so then now I'm just like
[4787.46 → 4793.30] well that sucks and it just I just get really demotivated so my biggest goal this time by a huge
[4793.30 → 4798.50] amount uh form is everything I usually don't get injured because of form problems I don't want to get
[4798.50 → 4805.06] into if it's a way longer conversation it is but uh the big goal this time is don't get injured
[4805.06 → 4811.06] yeah so I'm doing everything really high five yeah yeah I'm doing everything really
[4811.06 → 4817.46] scientifically okay I have notebooks yeah I track everything well I know you have that trainer
[4818.10 → 4822.34] not right now oh I'm going to be going back to him okay cool um because he was fantastic
[4822.90 → 4827.22] there's no nothing against him right now my schedule is just too weird i was doing
[4827.22 → 4831.94] stuff previously I got sick for three weeks there I have wisdom teeth coming out soon there's just
[4831.94 → 4835.62] stuff all over the place once my schedule gets a little bit more do steroids no oh my god
[4835.62 → 4846.34] oh my god what no um trust me my penis is small enough our balls rather yeah I mean both are true
[4846.34 → 4852.82] I was going to say is it I thought it was just but I thought it just reduced ball anyway no I mean both
[4852.82 → 4864.50] of the things I thought are true oh my god okay um so yeah I've been I've been uh very very very focused on
[4864.50 → 4869.54] being as like scientific and documented and measured about everything as I possibly can
[4869.54 → 4877.62] so I'm like taking really extensive notes I even track like um how grip feels right so like in one
[4877.62 → 4884.10] of my uh sets I end up doing a lot of things that require grip so I'll like note how my grip feels
[4884.10 → 4888.26] throughout the entire thing to like make sure there's no possibility of over training all this type of
[4888.26 → 4892.74] stuff blah blah blah, and it's been really it's been an interesting rabbit hole to dive
[4892.74 → 4898.34] um because traditionally I don't I don't know a lot about this and I wouldn't say that I do now
[4898.34 → 4904.18] um but I know a lot more than I did like three months ago because I've been doing a ton of research
[4904.18 → 4910.10] and trying to make sure that I don't uh this is hilarious this is probably the least tech when show
[4910.10 → 4919.46] in a very long time and people are loving it so dumb what even is this show I have no idea anymore
[4919.46 → 4926.90] i can uh if you want to target other areas and there's way better people to talk to about this
[4926.90 → 4932.50] than me but I can send you like a thing like a workout thing yeah uh I'm not going to do it
[4932.50 → 4937.94] okay I'll tell you right now I'm just not going to do it if I was there not okay no I just wouldn't invite
[4937.94 → 4942.82] you over I feel like that sounds like a lot of we have to go somewhere else anyway oh yeah don't have
[4942.82 → 4948.02] oh like at a gym yeah I'll do it once okay yeah yeah no I'll do it once I'll do it once I'll, I'll
[4948.02 → 4954.74] try it and I will be open-minded but I'm not going to like it yeah i I always hated it and i I've talked
[4954.74 → 4959.94] to Linus with this i I've only ever liked doing things that were really sports specific it's like
[4959.94 → 4964.34] something that I really used to enjoy was pushing weighted sleds sure because to me, it's like
[4964.34 → 4969.70] okay this is similar to rugby or football which I'm going to have to do this yeah so I might as well be
[4969.70 → 4974.34] good at this is really specific I like this i never really liked just like lifting weights
[4974.34 → 4981.62] um because I always wanted to train the sport instead of train strength um, but recently there's
[4981.62 → 4988.74] like health reasons why I'm doing this um and that is motivating yeah so I'm doing it for that and
[4988.74 → 4992.18] that's why I was saying like I'm focusing really on injury prevention and stuff like that because
[4992.18 → 4998.42] I'm like the goal is health reasons so I don't want to if I hurt myself that's a big negative for
[4998.42 → 5005.06] health reasons yeah so like i yeah it's that I have found that to be motivating for getting into
[5005.06 → 5009.94] the gym because I have started to feel significantly better like losing the weight when I was just
[5009.94 → 5016.42] focused on that was good mentally and physically like i felt a lot better I could tell you
[5016.42 → 5022.82] I could tell you felt different yeah yeah and now I have not lost I was losing weight fairly rapidly I think
[5022.82 → 5029.70] and then in the course of the last month I have actually not lost any weight at all my waist
[5029.70 → 5035.70] size has gone down but I have not lost weight because I've been converting right yeah I've been
[5035.70 → 5040.50] working on composition so I'm more focused on reducing fat amounts and stuff like that I don't
[5040.50 → 5045.22] really care about weight anymore for you to get me dragged out to the gym the best way to do it would
[5045.22 → 5052.26] be to make it work so why don't we do a float plane exclusive Linus's first gym session in 20 plus years
[5052.82 → 5056.42] and we'll just we'll drag a shooter out with us, we'll take someone from the social team or something
[5056.42 → 5063.06] like that, and we'll do it okay we could use like my terrible apartment gym or something sure or whatever
[5063.06 → 5067.38] because I don't know about filming like doing professional filming in gyms well it won't be
[5067.38 → 5070.98] professional filming it'll just be a full plane exclusive so it'll shoot one like an iPhone or whatever
[5070.98 → 5074.74] yeah yeah it should be fine yeah sure I mean people have got to be like filming themselves in the gym
[5074.74 → 5080.66] all the time yeah yeah there's no way yeah yeah yeah um instead like if we showed up with someone with
[5080.66 → 5090.26] like a like no no no, no no stuff yeah all right let's talk about some tech AMD announced their dozen 7000
[5090.26 → 5097.94] non-x and dozen 7000 x 3d chips at CES they made a lot of noise about these uh, and they're pretty exciting
[5097.94 → 5109.30] okay so last gen the 5800 x 3d was kind of worse than the regular 5800x overclocking was locked
[5110.10 → 5116.02] it was clear that AMD had some some some challenges they had to get the voltages dialled in perfectly for
[5116.02 → 5122.90] this thing um if I recall correctly the clock speeds weren't even quite as high as the regular 5800x don't
[5122.90 → 5129.54] quote me on that one uh the point is this time around the CDs are pretty darn aggressive base
[5129.54 → 5137.14] frequencies are lower, but turbo frequencies look like they are pretty equivalent to their non-x3d
[5137.14 → 5143.46] counterparts that's exciting because they have double the level 3 cache so we should see that same kind
[5143.46 → 5151.22] of gaming uplift we hope but they not only um are going to have the extra cache, but they're actually
[5151.22 → 5158.74] coming in at lower TDPS 120 watts versus 170 watts I'm pretty excited about these but I'm also really
[5158.74 → 5166.26] liking the look of the regular non-x 7000 series chips and here it's less about the specs and more
[5166.26 → 5174.58] about the difference in price the 7900 is over a hundred dollars less than the x it is theoretically
[5174.58 → 5183.14] anyway closer to a third of the power consumption than to half of it same cache nearly the same turbo
[5183.14 → 5192.26] frequency and much lower base frequencies we see that on the 77 and the 7600s as well but man these
[5192.26 → 5197.70] things could be gaming monsters for a much lower price and much lower power consumption which is a big
[5197.70 → 5206.50] deal these days meanwhile intel launched t-series and regular non-k series chips that um completely
[5206.50 → 5211.94] slipped under our radar they're supposedly launched I can't see anywhere you can buy them and I didn't
[5211.94 → 5217.14] see a single review we didn't even get so much as a heads-up that these things were coming let alone
[5217.14 → 5227.06] review samples which leads me to believe that um this could be bad uh here's the info on these
[5228.18 → 5235.54] they are mistakenly labelled as unlocked apparently they are in fact not unlocked uh where is that i
[5235.54 → 5241.22] don't I don't actually see that here, but it's in my oh yeah there it is oh it's up at the top sorry
[5241.22 → 5248.26] it's right here at the top core unlocked desktop processors nope they are apparently not unlocked um
[5248.98 → 5254.58] and so not only are they not unlocked for overclocking, but they also have more limited performance
[5254.58 → 5262.90] performance their TDPS are 65 or 35 watts, but turbo power can go as high as 219 watts on a core i9 13 900
[5263.54 → 5268.98] and it won't do that forever k series chips will boost forever as of 12th gen but non-k chips have
[5268.98 → 5275.22] power limits and will down clock to base clock after boosting for long enough the core i5-13600 and below
[5275.22 → 5281.06] also have some interesting characteristics level 2 cache drops to 11.5 versus 20 megabytes for the k
[5281.06 → 5286.82] k variant remember I was just talking about AMD's x3d chips and how adding more cash can be really great
[5286.82 → 5293.70] for gaming well you can probably extrapolate what taking cash away is likely to do um leaked slides
[5294.50 → 5300.74] showing this led to speculation that these chips are actually derived from alder lake oh instead of
[5300.74 → 5309.14] raptor lake interesting i i I doubt that I doubt that there are some improvements over 12th gen so the i's have
[5309.14 → 5318.82] um more e cores apparently okay so that's cool um yeah no okay Anthony wrote in here that they did not
[5318.82 → 5326.50] seed review samples at all so okay but at least hey you get oh new egg has them now let's see are they
[5326.50 → 5331.78] actually in stock can I buy one yes I can, and you get a free intel screwdriver with purchase what intel's
[5331.78 → 5336.26] competing with me now I was just going to say what's going on here intel where's the screwdriver what's it
[5336.26 → 5342.10] look like is it ratcheting okay well there they are so we're going to have to get on this and either
[5342.10 → 5345.86] intel's going to have to send us some samples, or we're just going to have to buy them because
[5345.86 → 5352.98] I want to know what the crap is going on oh yeah here's something you won't find that intel also
[5352.98 → 5361.06] quietly did on any promotional slides, but they quietly increased the price of most 12th gen chips by 10
[5361.06 → 5370.26] percent, so this actually makes 12th gen more expensive than 13th gen um okay our discussion
[5370.26 → 5375.22] question is what is intel trying to hide with these quiet launches and price adjustments maybe that
[5375.22 → 5383.30] its name competes with one of the biggest media companies in the world t-series thanks, thanks for
[5383.30 → 5389.22] that and how is intel expecting these to keep up with AMD's also just announced dozen 7000 non-x
[5389.22 → 5393.94] processors maybe they're not which is why they shadow launched it yeah I guess so it's a little
[5393.94 → 5402.10] weird i yeah i good luck intel yeah speaking of good luck dell apparently wants to phase out chips made
[5402.10 → 5410.10] in China by 2024 yeah dell plans to stop using Chinese-made semiconductors in all its products
[5411.06 → 5417.30] including chips produced by foreign suppliers inside china they're also telling suppliers to reduce the
[5417.30 → 5423.14] amount of others made in China components in products dell is reportedly concerned about us china tensions
[5423.14 → 5431.94] after the U.S. added Chinese memory chipmaker TMC and 21 other major companies in China uh in China's AI
[5431.94 → 5439.70] sector to a trade blacklist in December uh block list in December dell also expects to move 50 of
[5439.70 → 5446.02] production and assembly capacity outside of China by 2025. Most major brands are now sourcing most components
[5446.02 → 5452.74] from Taiwan and South Korea apple has moved it's a tiny fraction of their production to Vietnam
[5452.74 → 5459.62] uh but the Vietnamese labour force is less than seven percent the size of china's with only 12 of
[5459.62 → 5468.74] those being classed as highly skilled interesting moves this might china's creating a lot of their own
[5468.74 → 5484.34] problems right now, but they're also i also kind of feel for the companies there um a lot of this has nothing to do with them like this is a tough situation all around speaking of china by the way I did get some details wrong on the situation with the Michaels
[5484.34 → 5499.78] um the whole thing where they uh where they arrested the Huawei CFO um I'm not going to say she did nothing wrong because Huawei is a shady company um but that particular thing
[5500.34 → 5506.66] was a little more complicated than just she did something illegal, and it was bad and should have been arrested so
[5506.66 → 5516.34] there was a lot of political uh political 4d chess going on is all I'll really say about it at this point
[5516.34 → 5522.42] the main takeaway from last week though was not the details the point was I'm not travelling somewhere that
[5522.42 → 5533.06] arbitrarily detains Canadians that's it yeah uh it's its interesting though because if okay sorry
[5533.06 → 5540.18] well no I'm going to jump in with this sue for AWS in float plane chat why feel sorry for Chinese companies
[5540.18 → 5545.46] they're owned and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party at the end of the day not all of them that's why
[5545.46 → 5557.86] well and that that that's my whole point they did you answered your own question okay yeah uh what I'm
[5557.86 → 5563.14] saying is this might be an interesting like business move for dell uh I mean they sort of directly
[5563.14 → 5567.46] called it out but if one of the companies that they work with gets put on a block list
[5569.30 → 5573.94] that could be extremely disruptive if it happens suddenly but if they try to get ahead of the curve
[5573.94 → 5579.30] on this and work with companies that aren't going to be put on a block list because those companies are
[5579.30 → 5584.82] are outside their say in Taiwan or elsewhere or Vietnam or whatever um
[5584.82 → 5591.14] um yeah less disruption in the supply chain is good when you have a supply chain it's going to be
[5591.14 → 5594.74] hard to have less disruption in the supply chain I forget what the numbers are, but it's like a
[5594.74 → 5603.22] like a incredible percentage of earth's rare earth metals are mined in China like there is no
[5603.22 → 5608.34] semiconductor industry as we know it in places where china runs the mining yeah that's a whole other thing
[5608.34 → 5619.22] yeah yeah okay moving on I feel like we should do more merch messages, but there's probably
[5619.22 → 5623.94] other topics in here that we yeah I think there are a couple others that we I wanted to talk about Ea not
[5623.94 → 5629.86] being able to recover 60 of players corrupted madden save files now obvious I don't play madden um so i
[5629.86 → 5635.06] don't really have any skin in this particular game but here's what went down Madden NFL 23 has had
[5635.06 → 5639.54] server-side issues for months with the latest being a temporary data storage issue that led to the
[5639.54 → 5645.38] corruption of many players connected franchise mode save games being lost um there's the corruption of
[5645.38 → 5650.82] many uh last week anyway for about 14 hours between December 28th and 29th players trying to access the
[5650.82 → 5655.46] CFM server got an error message saying leagues were unavailable if you tried to log in during this time
[5655.46 → 5661.70] your save data was corrupted unfortunately this period came just hours after a twitter post letting players
[5661.70 → 5668.66] know that they could now play CFM without issue this was after developers fixed a previous problem
[5668.66 → 5673.46] in the game meaning that more players than normal may have tried to log in during this period you want
[5673.46 → 5678.26] to know what a depressing piece of information sure I have not fully validated this I just heard this from
[5678.26 → 5687.14] someone I don't remember who sorry whoever it was um FIFA ultimate team the like not completely but
[5687.14 → 5693.30] people are going to get mad at me if I say it because there's money printing machine yeah pay to win
[5694.26 → 5700.58] soccer basically um football but yes it's not because you can still be better than the other players shut up
[5700.58 → 5707.70] um pay to win FIFA soccer just brought in by itself just FIFA ultimate team
[5709.06 → 5715.78] more than Elden Ring made this year Elden Ring was game of the year wow and was like
[5716.58 → 5720.82] mass sometimes game of the year wins they're not necessarily like the most popular thing but
[5720.82 → 5726.82] Elden Ring was extremely popular oh yeah it was an it was a cultural moment absolutely yeah FIFA
[5726.82 → 5732.18] ultimate team still made more money annihilated it destroyed so you want you wonder why the games
[5732.18 → 5736.82] industry is going the way that it is yeah so the reason that I wanted to talk about this save game
[5736.82 → 5746.02] thing is that i i I have as someone who has lost save files and then ultimately just never gone back
[5746.02 → 5752.34] and finished the game because of how disheartening that was I feel for these guys this sucks and this
[5752.34 → 5759.86] is a huge part of why I get so angry at Nintendo for locking cloud saves on a portable device to people who
[5759.86 → 5767.54] pay a subscription that should be illegal um this is why I get this is why this is why I didn't play
[5767.54 → 5775.38] fantasia for so long that RPG yeah um from Harunobu Yamaguchi I think is his name but basically uh one
[5775.38 → 5781.06] of one of the guys that worked on Final Fantasy 6 like my all-time mostly favourite game I would
[5781.06 → 5785.06] have said all time through nostalgia glasses it's my favourite game, but there's probably games I've
[5785.06 → 5790.34] played since then that I think objectively are better but one of my all-time favourite games and
[5790.34 → 5796.66] the reason that I didn't play it was because it was exclusive to Apple Arcade and i just I had no way
[5796.66 → 5801.54] of knowing I had no way of controlling that save file any save file that isn't on a server that i
[5801.54 → 5810.82] control doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned um and i just this is why this is my problem because if i
[5810.82 → 5817.78] lose it all right I lost it that sucks, but that's on me that's on me yeah if somebody else loses it
[5817.78 → 5826.18] that is crap that's garbage that's garbage and I hate it but I caved I was at Costco right before
[5826.18 → 5835.94] Christmas picked up an Apple TV I've been playing fantasia it's great I love it uh and the reason is that
[5835.94 → 5840.42] i always just assumed it would get ported to something else at some point, and so I just like
[5840.42 → 5844.74] waited passively just waited and waited and waited it's been a long time okay part two's out okay I'm
[5844.74 → 5854.26] going to keep waiting apple funded the whole damn thing it's never going anywhere else yeah yeah yeah
[5854.26 → 5862.50] yeah yikes did we do the Ltd update I'm going to try and play it before I have to actually pay for arcade
[5862.50 → 5868.26] though but I did buy an Apple TV you return it part of the re no part of the reason I bought the Apple TV
[5868.26 → 5872.90] no that's not why I bought it at Costco uh part of the reason I bought the Apple TV is that I've
[5872.90 → 5880.58] been so um bullish on the shield for so long but I realized like you know whether it's our whether it's
[5880.58 → 5886.98] our admittedly ignorant conversation about ROK or whether it's Apple TV I actually haven't tried a lot
[5886.98 → 5892.98] of other platforms so I also want to just try it I've never tried an Apple TV and we're on like the
[5892.98 → 5900.82] eighth generation of this apparently popular device at this point so I was like okay it cost me 119
[5901.38 → 5907.22] or whatever and i can try this I can try this thing I've never tried before and I can also play
[5907.22 → 5915.54] this game I really want to play so yeah makes sense uh did we do the weekly update for Ltd no
[5915.54 → 5926.18] oh Sarah made some wallpapers for Ltd 2023, and they look amazing exciting is that the is that it no
[5926.18 → 5931.86] there we go hey that is actually that's cute uh these are for the different levels of
[5931.86 → 5934.74] of whale land hey the dolphin the orca
[5938.18 → 5944.34] whale hell yeah that's the winner then there's night mode whale oh that's so sick
[5944.34 → 5951.30] yeah we've got some really cool desk pad designs coming i I signed off on one recently that i
[5951.30 → 5958.10] absolutely love actually done by maria whale land I guess technically yeah her job is like graphic
[5958.10 → 5963.70] designer but what she mostly does is thumbnails so i never really thought of her as graphic designer i
[5963.70 → 5968.90] thought of her as thumbnail specialist so when I was like oh yeah who did this one it's like maria I was
[5968.90 → 5976.26] like oh what oh okay yeah right that makes sense yeah yeah uh we're getting ready for sales
[5976.26 → 5984.10] this month likely during wan oh wan show on the 27th we're being that clear okay, okay for that weekend
[5984.98 → 5988.42] want to pick a time that works for as many people as possible, but we know that someone will always
[5988.42 → 5993.62] be inconvenienced it's literally there's last Ltd people came from all over the world there are
[5993.62 → 5998.58] literally more than 24 time zones yeah there's only so much we can do to make sure that everyone
[5998.58 → 6005.22] gets a fair crack at it yeah um we can also probably do a preview of the ticket store slash page
[6005.22 → 6013.62] once things are further along okay cool tesla finally announces why is this in here do we care
[6013.62 → 6018.26] around steering wheel picture this I picked this whole thing why would you pick this because I think it's
[6018.26 → 6025.22] hilarious oh because they gave up because the yoke because their stock is like because the yoke made me
[6025.22 → 6035.62] so irrationally angry I do not like being told a race car I do not like being told how I am allowed to
[6035.62 → 6044.98] use my okay I don't like it and I think that while it might make sense in a track car
[6044.98 → 6051.38] I think that's cool if you only turn them 90 degrees yes or like a little bit more it is just
[6052.66 → 6059.30] i I considered a tesla at some point because you know I bought a new car yeah the yoke was better
[6059.30 → 6068.98] choice by the way absolute deal breaker there was no way that I was going to buy
[6068.98 → 6076.82] a vehicle that had a silly yoke for its steering wheel um and to the point where I actually looked
[6076.82 → 6084.90] up like third-party replacements and oh man it is sad how desperate people got to get rid of the yoke
[6085.54 → 6091.62] I couldn't find anywhere that actually had like a nicely moulded and wrapped like real replacement steering
[6091.62 → 6100.34] wheel but what you can buy is like an awful clip-on stupid cringe like steering wheel completer for the
[6100.34 → 6112.82] yoke and i so when I saw this i kind of went i just really like it when super arrogant companies that have
[6112.82 → 6120.74] the balls to dictate to the user the better way that you didn't want, and you're telling me you don't like
[6120.74 → 6126.66] but it's better I love it when they backtrack it was funny when I love it blizzard did that in a
[6126.66 → 6132.66] pretty legendary way when they were like they were talking about wild classic and the guy was
[6132.66 → 6138.98] asking for it and the person on stage was like he said you think you do, but you don't, and he was
[6138.98 → 6142.90] talking about like people wanting wild classic, and then they released it, and they're like no one's
[6142.90 → 6147.38] really going to play it and stuff and then everyone played it until they ruined it again yeah basically
[6147.38 → 6150.74] yeah pretty epic classic no that's blizzard
[6155.30 → 6161.06] speaking of other major companies Microsoft asks ChatGPT oh hold on there was one small
[6161.06 → 6167.78] detail okay um you can actually retrofit it now tesla will retrofit your yoke garbage with
[6167.78 → 6170.98] a steering wheel it'll cost you seven hundred dollars I wonder how many people are going to do that
[6170.98 → 6181.94] frankly I would pay it a hundred percent um okay yeah Microsoft ChatGPT oh wow Panos penne hopefully
[6181.94 → 6186.82] I said that correct I am very sorry the man in charge of windows told an audience at CES that the
[6186.82 → 6193.86] AI engine in AMD's new 7000 series chips is going to in quotes reinvent how you do everything in windows
[6193.86 → 6199.86] search that's a big statement he did not elaborate on how, but some journalists have been speculating
[6199.86 → 6205.78] that one improvement is going to be windows search I doubt it windows search has to be bad on purpose
[6205.78 → 6210.98] at this point yeah that's actually I feel that way as well it's atrociously bad, and it's been
[6210.98 → 6218.50] atrociously bad for a really long time yeah search genuinely on like Windows 7 is far better search on
[6218.50 → 6226.90] Windows 98 see is better yeah than the current search honestly wild genuinely wild um in 2019
[6226.90 → 6233.78] OpenAI entered an exclusive computing deal with Microsoft all their offerings since then from Dali
[6233.78 → 6241.38] to ChatGPT have run on azure servers this one billion dollar exclusivity deal is expected to extend
[6241.38 → 6247.94] to the desktop and perhaps also other parts of Microsoft's business he called this I called this hard
[6247.94 → 6252.58] called this so hard I don't remember whether it was on wan show or not I think it was private I will
[6252.58 → 6258.42] vouch for you, I appreciate it he called this super hard like immediately after we talked about ChatGPT
[6258.42 → 6263.94] okay go ahead yeah Microsoft is apparently in talks with OpenAI about implementing ChatGPT into bing which
[6263.94 → 6270.26] is specifically what I called out yeah to improve search results and overall user experience I mean people
[6270.26 → 6277.70] even without active access to the internet people just stopped googling things and started typing
[6277.70 → 6287.86] questions into ChatGPT with an active connection yeah literally like right when happy ChatGPT launched
[6287.86 → 6292.10] I started looking to open AI a little bit more saw that Microsoft had this billion dollar investment
[6292.10 → 6296.26] with technical exclusivity and all this type of stuff and I was like I see exactly where this is
[6296.26 → 6305.70] going because for whatever reason the thing that they won't drop is bing they've wanted bing to work for
[6305.70 → 6311.94] so long bad just doesn't push it so hard and it sucks so much binged thing is the word google
[6312.58 → 6318.58] um which has got to be so brutal yikes, and now they have ChatGPT and one of the main things that
[6318.58 → 6323.78] was said about ChatGPT when it first came out um not I don't see it as much these days but when it
[6323.78 → 6328.18] first came out was that this was going to replace search not in its current iteration and the biggest
[6328.18 → 6333.46] reason why is its main data set is from 2021. You can find more recent stuff on it and there is some more
[6333.46 → 6338.26] recent stuff on it, but it wasn't trained as extensively on recent stuff, and it's not it's
[6338.26 → 6343.06] not able to search the internet uh it's not searching more modern things on the internet
[6343.06 → 6351.78] etc, etc so with proper internet integration um or if like Microsoft does the internet stuff like maybe
[6351.78 → 6356.90] ChatGPT doesn't search the internet but bing does look a little bit and gets some resources and
[6356.90 → 6364.90] uh supplements your input and then spits an output from ChatGPT for you um also um
[6366.50 → 6372.02] what's it called 4.0 the thing that it's running on currently starting on 3.0 yeah um
[6374.10 → 6381.94] the like engine that runs the large language model that's just gpt4 GPT yeah yeah gpt3 is what we're
[6381.94 → 6388.90] currently using gpt4 is coming, and it's a massive massive improvement so if they
[6388.90 → 6393.86] launch this with gpt4, and it has some ability to scrape things from the internet whether that's bing
[6393.86 → 6402.90] feeding it information or what um it's going to be wild like bing could literally wait like overnight yeah
[6404.18 → 6408.42] and meanwhile google search is I swear it's getting worse feels like it's getting worse all the time
[6408.42 → 6415.14] there there is and I know some people can be like Google has stuff too yes google has large
[6415.14 → 6419.22] language models google has these types of things yeah but google seems to be also intentionally
[6419.22 → 6426.10] making your search results worse but that I feel like Microsoft wants to win enough that they won't do
[6426.10 → 6431.22] it yet and then they'll win, and then they'll do it because this is how everything works yeah but
[6431.22 → 6436.82] like in the short term I feel like they're they're gonna focus on it being perfect yeah
[6436.82 → 6443.30] Jaden says in chat ChatGPT actually gives me freaking answers to my questions as opposed to
[6443.30 → 6448.26] google searches where I have to sift through sites disable my ad block see 10 billion ads and then try
[6448.26 → 6453.22] to read through an article that wafts for 60 paragraphs blah blah blah have I told you my trick
[6453.22 → 6459.54] for reading articles these days I skipped to the third paragraph oh interesting the first two paragraphs
[6459.54 → 6464.42] are almost always useless and I learned this from I won't name him but I learned this from a friend of
[6464.42 → 6472.02] mine who used to write articles for a website that reviews phones um and oh some people might guess
[6472.02 → 6479.62] but uh is this someone I know yeah uh he informed me that a lot of the like the first bits of
[6479.62 → 6488.02] articles are there to make you scroll down so you see more ads yeah because i I told them like oh I do
[6488.02 → 6492.10] this thing where I skip to the third paragraph because I feel like that's where the articles often start
[6492.10 → 6499.38] right, and he's like well yeah sort of like not I wasn't like exactly on point or whatever the labs
[6499.38 → 6503.94] website will not work like that if we have an intro it'll be because that's information you need
[6503.94 → 6509.86] yeah okay the labs' website in its current form basically has a TLDR at the top so it's like almost
[6509.86 → 6517.86] the opposite the labs' website in its current form is a money losing machine yeah let's go yeah heck yeah
[6517.86 → 6524.66] let's go keep buying screwdrivers yeah and backpacks buy lots of backpacks to put your screwdrivers in
[6524.66 → 6530.74] yeah yeah this is a lot of topics are we getting through all these uh no I don't think so I'm here
[6530.74 → 6537.86] for it, I mean oh well I think we have to talk about the um repair shop owners claiming that standing your
[6537.86 → 6544.18] PS5 vertically can kill the console whoa yeah that's right many in the repair community have seen the liquid
[6544.18 → 6549.38] metal thermal interface material that Sony is using leak from between the APU and the cooler
[6550.42 → 6552.58] I wonder who could have warned them that this might happen
[6554.74 → 6562.02] we killed some stuff we killed a racer phone we killed a really nice laptop I'm pretty sure we killed
[6562.02 → 6569.46] a desktop board at some point and the problem is that liquid metal is liquid and gravity works um
[6570.10 → 6575.46] this blew up recently from a pair of tweets uh from a French repair technician that has been
[6575.46 → 6580.90] discussed in the repair community for some time uh the coder a YouTuber specializing in repairing
[6580.90 → 6585.30] consoles posted a video three months ago of him repairing a PS5 that he claims had sat vertically
[6585.30 → 6592.58] in its packaging for months and refused to boot once sold in the video he peels the seal around the APU
[6592.58 → 6598.10] and shows obvious liquid metal leakage he's able to remove the liquid metal and cover the area around the
[6598.10 → 6603.86] APU with conformal coating fixing the issue, and he says this is a design flaw on Sony's part i actually
[6603.86 → 6610.74] don't necessarily agree with that assessment the correct design would seal in the liquid metal properly
[6610.74 → 6619.14] so that it doesn't leak out at all not to conformal coat anywhere that it could leak onto um conformal coating
[6619.14 → 6627.38] is a band-aid not a real solution in my opinion um I mean obviously especially because you might
[6627.38 → 6634.34] manipulate the object yeah in well okay the idea is that the conformal coating is around it in all
[6634.34 → 6643.22] directions so that if it does leak it won't actually uh bridge any contacts and cause a short right but by
[6643.22 → 6647.38] that time you've kind of already lost the game you're just kind of delaying the inevitable until you can
[6647.38 → 6651.14] formal coat the entire inside and at that point why don't we just put in a liquid metal bath
[6652.26 → 6659.06] right I'm I'm obviously being facetious at this point but i just I think that a better seal is the
[6659.06 → 6664.66] better solution um another French repair shop posted about this leakage issue on Facebook back in August
[6664.66 → 6670.58] and October of this year uh PlayStation focused news site push square called these reports questionable
[6670.58 → 6676.10] and claimed that those discussing the issue uh are saying something bad needs to happen to the seal
[6676.10 → 6682.90] protecting it for this to happen uh okay yeah the discussion question is what should Sony have done
[6683.46 → 6690.74] I mean I don't know because I'm not an engineer and I don't know the right solution for sealing liquid
[6690.74 → 6694.82] metal I know that Asus has been using it in their laptops for a while to my knowledge there's no
[6694.82 → 6701.30] widespread failures but I'd love to yeah I'd love to hear from you guys if you know of anyone
[6701.30 → 6711.78] who has done liquid metal well replace it replace your PS5 head gasket every 20 000 miles a pagan all
[6711.78 → 6718.50] suggests maybe it's a time thing maybe if we went back to before 1655 we wouldn't have this problem
[6718.50 → 6723.94] before sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity oh nice yeah, yeah then it wouldn't leak that makes sense that
[6723.94 → 6730.34] seems pretty good yeah uh in the meantime if you have a PlayStation 5 maybe lay it flat cool
[6732.90 → 6739.54] um let's do AMD finally admits the Rx 7900 ATX overheating was caused by a defective vapour chamber
[6740.18 → 6746.50] AMD finally admitted that the overheating issue affecting Radeon RX 7900 ATX graphics cards is caused
[6746.50 → 6752.90] by a manufacturing defect womp the admission comes yeah there's a lot in here but basically
[6752.90 → 6758.82] der Bauer did a good job and AMD says they'll replace any affected cards hey the issue is they're
[6758.82 → 6764.02] apparently very low on stock because they actually made a good GPU for a change so that's tough that's
[6764.02 → 6771.46] a tough situation um let's do some merch messages yeah okay all right let's get you some here
[6771.46 → 6778.10] first one's from anonymous Luke or Linus hey I liked that hack you did by the way big fan
[6780.34 → 6784.90] there's a lot of them it's a very common name I think well they're they're just super into LTT
[6784.90 → 6789.94] they're really technical yeah okay those folks uh Luke or Linus what are your thoughts about pen test
[6789.94 → 6794.98] learning tools like flipper zero becoming more available to individuals with the intent to meme
[6794.98 → 6802.74] or troll definitely anonymous uh flippers can read NFC copy slash replicate key fobs and emit it signals
[6802.74 → 6809.30] there's been there's been tools uh that you could use maliciously available to everyone on the planet
[6809.30 → 6817.06] uh since humans started making tools um I don't think that's a hammer is a malicious tool if you use it
[6817.06 → 6824.42] to pry open a door yeah like i I don't think uh being all concerned about people having access to
[6824.42 → 6832.82] flipper zeros and doing trolley things with it is a good or legitimate argument um I think it's
[6832.82 → 6840.50] really cool um that someone who might be interested in uh learning how to defend against those types of
[6840.50 → 6846.90] attacks or someone who might be interested in working on uh pen testing or a pen testing career
[6847.54 → 6851.46] or whatever even if you're just interested in checking out what vulnerabilities your own
[6851.46 → 6856.26] workplace or your own personal setup or whatever might have I think it's very cool that people
[6856.26 → 6863.54] can have access to um a device like a flipper zero I think flipper zeros are fantastic um, and they're
[6865.38 → 6875.30] yeah they're just cool yeah could I use man you can do lots with them, he fobs suck is there a device
[6875.30 → 6881.78] that you could use it like that will like to clone your key fob because the key fob for my new car is huge
[6881.78 → 6889.14] it's horrible and now that um now that there are three cars that I could potentially have to drive oh so
[6889.14 → 6893.30] you want to be able to like switch which one it is and then I only want one like how's that not a
[6893.30 → 6900.66] product and I understand why it's not a product but like oh if carjackers have them than I want them
[6900.66 → 6906.66] for real though no I hear you I've got a flipper zero on my desk we could try it yeah might be uh
[6906.66 → 6910.98] might be a fun thing to do yeah lots you can there might be uh there might be some wear and tear
[6910.98 → 6914.50] on the vehicle once you're done trying it is that where we're going with this I was going to let
[6914.50 → 6924.50] you play with it but okay uh I'm jack b keeps releasing really cool payloads for uh flipper zero
[6924.50 → 6931.14] as well uh I think you guys featured him in a video fairly recently uh because of contributions that he
[6931.14 → 6937.70] made as well um but yeah I'll check him out he makes perfect videos too um but like what I was
[6937.70 → 6946.26] technically just referring to was his GitHub page uh, but he makes cool videos etc um there's lots
[6946.26 → 6950.90] of cool things you can do with if it's a very interesting field um to start messing around with
[6950.90 → 6958.10] if you are interested in tech so yeah I would not discourage it there's like there's always been
[6958.10 → 6966.02] stuff you used to be able to buy these flash drives um from oh I'm not going to be able to remember
[6966.02 → 6972.50] the company name, but they had us uh, uh a slide out there wasn't a ton of flash drives at
[6972.50 → 6978.02] the time that had that it was like retractable I had no idea whatever it doesn't matter, but they had
[6978.02 → 6983.94] they had a thing I don't remember what it's called, but it would open a prompt when you plugged
[6983.94 → 6988.50] it into your computer, and it was like it was supposed to emulate like a CD or something I don't
[6988.50 → 6993.06] remember what it was but there were crazy amounts of payloads you could just deploy through that
[6993.06 → 7002.18] and you could buy those at like Best Buy it's just a flash drive huh and and and you just download
[7002.18 → 7008.98] payloads offline I think they were called uh switchblade and hacksaw back in the day um hack5 rubber
[7008.98 → 7017.62] ducky yeah yeah um like these are people can make malicious tools out of whatever yeah
[7017.62 → 7022.58] like their man imagine the kinds of malicious tools they could make if they had a hammer that
[7022.58 → 7029.14] turned into a crowbar I checked for updates on that recently there are none um I wonder if we ever
[7029.14 → 7034.90] reached out and offered to buy them no did we not you told me to and I decided not to do it I'm messaging
[7034.90 → 7045.62] nick oh my goodness oh it's its so stupid I don't want to I don't want to do if it's not even like
[7045.62 → 7049.86] a very anyway I'm not going to get too far into it, you're just sending the email anyway so it
[7049.86 → 7055.14] doesn't matter oh yeah I'm not listening to you even a little I'm messaging nick and kyle so you know
[7055.14 → 7064.50] I'm really serious damn it oh no oh man maybe there's a reason why it's been in product development
[7065.30 → 7073.94] maybe for like what like 10 years maybe we shouldn't take this on or maybe we who took three years to
[7073.94 → 7079.70] build a screwdriver have just the kind of tenacity that it takes to push this thing over the finish line
[7079.70 → 7087.70] a screwdriver is like a product that exists yeah a hammer that splits in half and is a crowbar and
[7087.70 → 7095.06] is a wrench and is all these other types of things that sound cool let's make it oh I am so sorry kyle I tried
[7095.06 → 7102.26] hit me Dan I'll take I'll take two uh here's one from Arturo uh Linus you had your steam deck for a while
[7102.26 → 7107.22] how do you feel about the Gilly kit outer dead zone I find that it defeats the whole purpose of
[7107.22 → 7115.78] the product sad face I don't daily drive the one that got the Gilly kit um sticks in it, I did not
[7115.78 → 7121.62] know about the outer dead zone on their hall effect joysticks I will have to get back to you on that um
[7121.62 → 7126.66] or I probably won't get back to you on that but I will keep that in mind next time I'm looking at a
[7126.66 → 7132.42] a hall effect joystick particularly one from Gilly kit I didn't notice uh but i only used that
[7132.42 → 7138.50] in the time you guys saw me use it uh that's the like modded steam deck that lives here with the like
[7139.22 → 7144.10] heat sink hanging off the back of it and stuff no one daily drives that it's more of like a prop at
[7144.10 → 7152.58] this point got one here from William hi I'm hi love from Taiwan how do you feel about the TSMC renewed
[7152.58 → 7158.66] additional 28 billion investment in its Arizona fab plant and how is it going to affect the chip
[7158.66 → 7168.82] production industry it's TMS uh it's cut off here sorry um it will lower prices which will be good for
[7168.82 → 7176.98] us will it well it depends if china demand is so high it just won't matter well demand is not that
[7176.98 → 7182.26] high for cutting edge nodes okay cutting edge which is interesting like why does it keep running into
[7182.26 → 7191.62] me thank you where did it even go um in your crotch actually it's right oh yeah yeah it's right buddy
[7191.62 → 7198.74] yeah it's right there how's it going friend it's uh yep it's in his crotch okay cool so anyway um
[7198.74 → 7207.54] um I mean we've we've we've seen that apparently the latest nodes are um not even necessarily
[7208.66 → 7213.86] shrinking the same way that they used to I think it was uh caches are not really are not really getting
[7213.86 → 7219.46] smaller uh on like the latest shrinks you'll have to forgive me this is stuff that I haven't like
[7219.46 → 7223.46] prepared I didn't get ready to make a video about it or anything I think it's for an manometer or something
[7223.46 → 7227.86] like that from TSMC where they're basically saying like yeah caches aren't going to get smaller so
[7228.74 → 7235.46] cool so your compute will your logic will, but your caches won't um so we're we're already seeing
[7236.18 → 7241.54] AMD release products that are using chaplets that are built on a variety of nodes because only some
[7241.54 → 7246.50] of their functions are benefiting from these shrinks so with that in mind if the industry is moving
[7246.50 → 7252.98] towards chaplet based designs demand for these these these top tier top spec nodes could actually go
[7252.98 → 7260.98] down yeah uh GPU sales are at their lowest in like ever or something like that not, not ever but in
[7260.98 → 7268.50] in a very long time um and so phone SOCS apparently Qualcomm is on the fence whether they
[7268.50 → 7274.90] will even use um uh four nanometers this year I think it's four and I think it's I think it's uh four
[7274.90 → 7282.74] nanometre from TSMC I think apple's locked in but like basically nobody else is right now so obviously
[7282.74 → 7287.86] i you know love to see more capacity because theoretically that means lower prices for
[7287.86 → 7293.22] consumers but if they get a bit really hard on this it could slow down development in the future then
[7293.22 → 7297.78] again intel is going to be breathing down their throat theoretically with their like third-party fab
[7298.42 → 7307.86] business all right okay this one's from Eric hey guys MHD released a video lately addressing how
[7307.86 → 7313.70] iPhone cameras are getting worse over time TLDR post-processing ruined smartphone photos which i
[7313.70 → 7320.42] personally agree what do you guys think I mean what else do you want them to do they can't put a big fat
[7320.42 → 7328.82] sensor in it well they can actually um okay you think they should just stagnate well no I think
[7328.82 → 7338.98] adding more post-processing which uh could potentially ruin photos or whatever uh is actually good or is
[7338.98 → 7346.82] it just a marketing attempt to move it forward yeah I mean I never use like um heavily computational
[7346.82 → 7353.30] photo modes like i I never use things like portrait mode or anything like that so uh
[7355.86 → 7364.82] but on the other hand I can under ideal conditions they can outperform a less assisted um photo
[7364.82 → 7369.46] pipeline so I don't know what the right answer is here guys to be perfectly honest with you
[7370.50 → 7375.78] I mean bigger sensors yeah, but the thing about bigger sensors is bigger sensors cost money on every
[7375.78 → 7382.98] device better software costs money once yeah, and then you can have cheaper devices so obviously
[7382.98 → 7393.06] that's the route that apple prefers but I don't I don't see an obvious solution here okay this one's
[7393.06 → 7400.66] from Eric hi Luke and Linus have you guys seen any of the rumours for the next GPUs after the 7900s if so
[7400.66 → 7406.10] what are your thoughts on them and do you think they have a chance to beat NVIDIA I don't know I've
[7406.10 → 7411.06] never cared about rumour mill stuff yeah that's that's such a long way off I think there's just nothing
[7411.06 → 7421.86] to really talk about at this point yeah sorry XXX explosive XXX asks the most hell yeah 2008 username
[7421.86 → 7426.66] yeah play some Call of Duty ever yeah hi Linus happy new year and what are your goals for the
[7426.66 → 7435.62] company here in 2023 um my goals are really focused on labs this year I think that I've made that
[7435.62 → 7444.26] abundantly clear throughout the show uh pretty much every other part of the company is tied into labs in
[7444.26 → 7450.50] some way whether it's creator warehouse um creating merch around the lab or with the help of the lab like
[7450.50 → 7457.06] labs exists to test things for ourselves internally as well uh whether it's float plane you know float
[7457.06 → 7463.94] plane's potential biggest customer becoming the labs' website uh whether it's LTT leaning on labs' data for
[7463.94 → 7471.54] much, much better videos uh i I loved our 4070 ti review I think there are things that we can improve
[7471.54 → 7476.58] in the video format I think that retention wasn't as high as I'd like to see so there's probably some
[7476.58 → 7480.42] things that we can cut once we have supplementary reading and we can just kind of point people to
[7480.42 → 7486.82] that if they want more detail and we can do more of a TLDR style video but man the detail that we had
[7486.82 → 7493.30] the data we had the how early we knew what our angle was going to be for it compared to when we
[7493.30 → 7499.30] were trying to do all the testing ourselves with the writing team was awesome that's the bar that we
[7499.30 → 7507.22] want to be at for any of our editorial content and it's not going to happen overnight um yeah it's not
[7507.22 → 7511.94] going to happen overnight but in time man this kind of stuff that we're working on whether it's
[7512.50 → 7519.46] um automating the creation of graphs or whether it's a better automating our test processes uh we're
[7519.46 → 7524.58] we're working on uh actually this will be a video so we're we're going to be doing a video where we
[7524.58 → 7530.18] get a bunch of the same CPU and like source them from all kinds of different places samples from
[7530.18 → 7536.82] intel buying them from new egg buying them here in retail in Canada waiting a month doing all the same
[7536.82 → 7541.62] all of those again to make sure that these are from different batches produced at different times
[7541.62 → 7547.78] sent to different places and then what we want to do is we want to put them all on in the same
[7547.78 → 7552.82] motherboard and see what the performance differences are because if we could parallelize our testing
[7552.82 → 7559.70] more man we could do a lot of testing but we need to know if they actually perform the same before we
[7559.70 → 7568.82] can just set up a bunch of parallel test benches right exciting hey Hayden asks hey guys any tips
[7568.82 → 7574.26] on how to run an efficient pre-production meeting I work as a technical director for a local news station
[7574.26 → 7578.82] and it can be challenging to get everyone on the same page for our daily show curious to hear how you
[7578.82 → 7587.54] plan slash coordinate before you're shooting content um that's an interesting question a pre-production
[7587.54 → 7594.66] meeting I mean tips for running uh an efficient meeting in general are just cut out anything that
[7594.66 → 7600.58] you don't have to do um as for getting everyone on the same page I feel like this is one of those
[7600.58 → 7605.70] things that i I honestly have a bit of a blind spot for at this point I've been in charge for so long
[7605.70 → 7612.42] that i kind of forget um how hard it is to build consensus if you're not if your name isn't on the building
[7612.42 → 7618.02] and I don't I the point of this is not for you guys to go oh no this is so out of touch the
[7618.02 → 7627.22] point is that I'm telling you that i I don't really know how to do that anymore like I'll ask questions
[7628.02 → 7634.50] oh okay actually okay there yeah asking questions uh getting people's input um demonstrating that you've
[7634.50 → 7640.66] heard it and then setting a course so that's the part that i I was going to say i think it's more
[7640.66 → 7646.98] course setting here you guys plan out what people are going to work on then trust they're going to
[7646.98 → 7653.06] work on it fairly well and then at the very end you have like script review and then it's out yeah
[7656.02 → 7663.38] I didn't even know we planned things here hey okay moving on from Richard hi LTT after watching the BTS
[7663.38 → 7668.98] vid you put on YouTube I might need to get a flow plane sub now do you find it hard to build a team
[7668.98 → 7674.42] of both people who are interested both in technology and people who are interested in making videos
[7675.06 → 7679.14] yeah it can be tough I mean some of our hiring practices have been controversial and we've
[7679.14 → 7687.30] talked about them on the show I mean I yeah well that was that that was bad um but I'm I'm talking
[7687.30 → 7692.90] specifically about how like we don't like to discuss salary until we've already figured out if we think
[7692.90 → 7696.98] someone's going to be a good fit if they're going to be passionate about the work just because we want
[7696.98 → 7701.06] people who are passionate doesn't mean we don't want to pay them well it just means that we want
[7701.06 → 7706.34] people who are passionate like I'll see people talk about that in the chat they'll be like I've never
[7706.34 → 7712.82] worked for a company that's that's like that and it's like good go away I don't want you here no
[7712.82 → 7718.26] problem um like I said the point and I get it people have probably been burned by stuff like that
[7718.26 → 7722.90] before like oh anytime you hear someone talk about how we want to run it more like a family business red
[7722.90 → 7728.34] flag red flag red flag yeah, yeah sure yeah that's that's fair that's you know in a lot
[7728.34 → 7733.70] of ways that's just coded language for we want you to work for free like our family members would I get
[7733.70 → 7741.86] it yeah but that's how we did it we found people who are who would do it anyway and then paid them to
[7741.86 → 7751.46] do it better and do it more like i I don't know what to tell you yeah got an anonymous question here
[7751.46 → 7756.66] I've been working in startups for nearly 10 years and dealing with VCS always hold on I love
[7756.66 → 7761.22] this the badger hound yeah that's a demonstrably awful hiring practice compensation should be in
[7761.22 → 7767.54] the ad good for you, it's demonstrably worked great for us demonstrably is a word that actually has a
[7767.54 → 7773.86] meaning well my example and I always like apologize when we get to this part of the call but my example
[7773.86 → 7779.38] that I give is for development hiring you can maybe guess by looking at our audience that there might
[7779.38 → 7785.54] be a lot of developers in the audience so when we put up jobs for developers uh one of the positions
[7785.54 → 7792.18] in particular got over 10 000 applications they don't always get that it got that because there
[7792.18 → 7797.30] was a shout-out in a video usually what's right more realistic is a little bit less than a thousand
[7797.30 → 7804.58] but still like tons and I want the best person potential for the job so that's actually a pretty
[7804.58 → 7809.78] wide range there are a lot of potential solutions there also if I'm hiring a bunch of people
[7809.78 → 7815.38] like when we did the first wave of hiring for the whole labs web dev team it's like okay I actually do
[7815.38 → 7824.02] sort of have a budget this time that was a first but I have a budget for the team yeah I don't know how
[7824.02 → 7828.90] this is going to land maybe someone's a superstar I don't want to bring them in so I would want to
[7828.90 → 7833.70] increase the budget for that role I don't want to put out a fixed budget because maybe I get a melting
[7833.70 → 7837.38] pot of people that I think are going to be a really, really good solution and this person's a
[7837.38 → 7843.46] super junior and this person's very superstar yeah like and maybe i I have really, really high
[7843.46 → 7847.22] hopes for this junior but they are a junior they're not going to be able to contribute a ton immediately
[7847.22 → 7850.42] or or or whatever like there's a bunch of different reasons why you might take in different
[7850.42 → 7857.30] people at different rates you sound very anti anti-worker right now do I believe it or not yeah
[7857.30 → 7863.14] you've actually you've become like management which is hilarious to me um one of the one of the
[7863.14 → 7868.42] articles that was an option for us to talk about on the show today was about some of the new laws
[7868.42 → 7876.74] in the states about advertising salary ranges in your want ads um and how I do companies are skirting
[7876.74 → 7885.86] them yeah so uh Netflix famously uh put up a posting for a job that had a salary range from sixty thousand
[7885.86 → 7890.74] dollars a year to I think either five hundred or six hundred thousand dollars a year but the funny
[7890.74 → 7898.34] thing is and in that space hold on the thing people were outraged about was that that leaves
[7898.34 → 7904.02] room for discrimination people could have the same job and the same responsibilities but at wildly
[7904.02 → 7908.42] different pay, but that's the thing you got to understand just because they have the same job title
[7908.42 → 7912.82] don't mean they have the same responsibilities doesn't mean they have the same experience doesn't
[7912.82 → 7920.42] mean they're going to have the same output so I see it from both sides here um you can, I see i I see it
[7920.42 → 7926.02] from both sides here yeah i I get it I get it as well it would be annoying it would be a lot if I was
[7926.02 → 7932.66] looking for jobs it would be a lot clearer if I knew what the salary range or exact salary was for that
[7932.66 → 7938.82] potential job but then I also understand Netflix posting that because that I think you mentioned it
[7938.82 → 7944.10] might be trolling it might not be no, no I didn't say it was trolling okay no that might be totally
[7944.10 → 7949.70] legit because they might be interested in bringing in juniors yep maybe juniors that don't even have
[7949.70 → 7955.22] very much education at all or potentially like basically none and or very much experience or
[7955.22 → 7960.50] potentially basically none and Netflix might be interested in like okay this person seems very
[7960.50 → 7964.58] driven and interested in some video stuff or whatever we want to bring them on, but then there might
[7964.58 → 7969.06] be some superstar engineer from somewhere else and that might cost a ton, and they might be interested
[7969.06 → 7974.10] in them too so like I don't know this is great uh every once in a while twitch chat says something
[7974.10 → 7980.98] brilliant this ain't it king Canada live output is largely dictated by operating conditions provided
[7980.98 → 7986.42] by the employer that shouldn't be measured against salary if the operating conditions you're an idiot
[7986.42 → 7994.42] if the operation is the operating conditions are the same across the board then I don't necessarily see
[7994.42 → 8005.46] how that applies what have you ever met another human being not honestly though you don't think that
[8005.46 → 8012.74] there could possibly be some output difference under the same conditions between two people I think he was
[8012.74 → 8019.06] saying differing conditions but I don't see it output is largely dictated by the operating conditions
[8019.06 → 8023.46] provided by the employer yeah that's what I'm saying that shouldn't be measured against salary but he
[8023.46 → 8029.94] didn't necessarily so your output and your salary should just be disconnected because it's your fault as
[8029.94 → 8039.46] the employer if their output sucks well it could be it could be but also um no i do think company and
[8039.46 → 8046.74] conditions play a lot in the role of output but if your conditions are similar across
[8046.74 → 8057.70] the company then the opportunity for output should be unbelievable yeah yeah
[8059.94 → 8064.98] okay well let's get back to our venture capital yeah going from some money stuff I've been working on
[8064.98 → 8069.14] startups for nearly 10 years and dealing with venture capitals I assume that's what a VC is
[8069.14 → 8074.10] yeah always burns me out how do you guys keep going when business development shenanigans keep you
[8074.10 → 8081.22] down but don't deal with VCS yeah that was actually i I think I'm the one who curated this and that's
[8081.22 → 8088.66] what I was going to say uh deal every i just i I was stuck at a table at like a social event with
[8088.66 → 8096.02] someone who worked as like a VC person like you know finding companies to fund and getting funding
[8096.02 → 8103.14] whatever and just like even just socially I couldn't stand it just like and to be clear they were like
[8103.14 → 8107.62] nice enough but just anytime they talked about that stuff I was just like oh I hate it I just hate
[8107.62 → 8118.18] everything about it um yeah okay this one's from pascal hey Luke I'm a freelance back-end of programmer
[8118.18 → 8123.38] and hope to someday get hired by a real company what are your fears hiring a programmer with close
[8123.38 → 8129.70] to no experience working in a team uh the first non-infrastructure hire that I had was a programmer
[8129.70 → 8137.78] with uh little to no experience working with in a team, and he's fantastic, and he's still around
[8138.42 → 8143.86] you're saying you don't have fears about that there are fears um there are concerns, but there are concerns
[8143.86 → 8154.58] with everything um so like I don't know um try to do okay you're not the hiring person I see this is
[8154.58 → 8161.78] framed so if you as the person doing the hiring try to do your job as well as you can well I guess you
[8161.78 → 8165.78] might do the hiring and not be the manager whatever so the person managing that person needs to try to do
[8165.78 → 8173.46] their job as well as possible and train that person to work in a team well um and as the person being
[8173.46 → 8179.78] hired try to be receptive to how the team works when you show up um try to work well within that
[8179.78 → 8183.86] team structure and then once you've been there for a bit if you have ideas and suggestions how they can
[8183.86 → 8190.18] change then forward those but try to get used to the structure that's there first um yeah I don't know
[8190.18 → 8195.70] there's you got to start somewhere someone has to pick you up uh and there's there are benefits to it
[8195.70 → 8201.30] as the company because then you get to kind of help mould this person into working the way that your
[8201.30 → 8206.58] company works and uh there are negatives to it because maybe they won't maybe they'll clash with
[8206.58 → 8211.22] other members, or maybe they'll, they'll be really difficult to communicate with or whatever but try
[8211.22 → 8215.62] to work on those things a lot of people are receptive to that kind of stuff people don't
[8216.18 → 8222.34] usually in my experience like being terrible at things so I don't know yeah
[8224.74 → 8230.50] okay I've got one here from Scott your line of work means you get my you must deal with a lot of
[8230.50 → 8236.26] useless criticism, but it can't be all bad what's the most helpful constructive criticism you have
[8236.26 → 8240.98] received from your community PS thanks for making a backpack that will fit all the tools I need to
[8240.98 → 8248.26] work in an closets nice um helpful constructive criticism i I don't know if I could pick a single
[8248.26 → 8254.10] helpful constructive criticism because a lot of it's just like so specific it's like there's no one
[8254.10 → 8260.34] piece of there's no one comment I ever read on YouTube that was like oh yeah big course correction
[8261.70 → 8267.06] let's go in this direction, but there's absolutely been a bunch of constructive criticism it's a thousand
[8267.06 → 8275.46] it's a thousand little nudges every day and it's more like it's more like today there were 600 that
[8275.46 → 8280.42] pushed this way and 400 that pushed this way so we're kind of going a bit more this way and then over
[8280.42 → 8286.02] time it looks like we over corrected so we need to actually go back out this way like it's um I don't
[8286.02 → 8299.46] know part of what makes me able to do my job is that it's um is that i I just try to look at this gigantic
[8299.46 → 8307.70] cloud of data points and find a pattern in it and I think I'm kind of able to do that okay I don't I
[8307.70 → 8311.30] don't think I'm great at it there's definitely people who are better at it but I think I'm kind
[8311.30 → 8323.30] of okay at it yeah wrong one okay I got one here from Patrick my son's birthday is coming up he wants
[8323.30 → 8328.58] a new gaming computer he has shown interest in electronics and wants to put it together himself
[8328.58 → 8333.78] is there any company or manufacturer that sells kits with pre-selected parts to build your own computer at
[8333.78 → 8343.46] home uh I didn't think so no I thought this was an interesting not to my knowledge uh NCI tried to
[8343.46 → 8347.62] do it at one point, but it just wasn't feasible because the whole point of a custom computer is
[8347.62 → 8352.90] that you pick all your own crap and as soon as you start trying to make it kind of pre-done for you
[8353.46 → 8359.30] it's like oh well I want that but like could I change the ram, and then it's not really pre-done and
[8359.30 → 8366.58] it becomes really high touch is what we called it there 's's there are solutions though um i
[8366.58 → 8373.54] feel like I haven't talked about them in forever but not apparently has a kit not BLD build yeah is
[8373.54 → 8376.66] that a kit though is build a kit
[8380.02 → 8385.38] yeah so Conrad just suggested exactly what I was going to suggest basically pc part picker has
[8385.38 → 8393.78] pre-made lists you could just order that or like go on the uh that won't have instructions though i
[8393.78 → 8397.86] think they're kind of hoping for instructions well yeah if it's like okay so
[8397.86 → 8403.22] order that and then watch the Ltd video that Anthony made which is like the only build guide you'll ever
[8403.22 → 8408.74] need and then combine those two, and then you're good that's fair um the other thing I was going to
[8408.74 → 8417.22] bring up is the build a pc Subreddit or the uh pc build planning part of the forum there 's's
[8417.22 → 8420.66] lots of resources out there where people will effectively give you a list of parts to buy
[8421.22 → 8426.98] um the pc part picker one I'm pretty sure you can literally just like to add all to cart and then buy and
[8426.98 → 8437.30] it'll work so it's an option next up I got one here from Jacob why does NVIDIA and AMD utilize third-party
[8437.30 → 8441.94] manufacturing of GPUs instead of only in-house production wouldn't it be a better business
[8441.94 → 8449.54] decision similar to CPU production being only in-house but riskier that's the danger obviously
[8449.54 → 8456.90] wouldn't it be a better business decision for us to build out injection moulding facilities and uh you
[8456.90 → 8461.86] know metal tooling facilities that are mass production capable if we're going to build a screwdriver
[8461.86 → 8468.98] software I mean we'd probably get our per-unit costs down eventually but only if we were doing
[8468.98 → 8475.38] just wild amounts of volume by comparison if we just go to companies that specialize in these things a
[8475.38 → 8480.42] have the experience b they have the equipment and c they have the volume because of all their other
[8480.42 → 8487.06] customers that it actually ends up being probably more cost-effective, and we don't have to make all
[8487.06 → 8493.78] those investments up front someone else you know bought or leased that equipment 5 10 maybe even 20
[8493.78 → 8500.50] years ago in some cases so it's like completely paid off, and we're just renting time on it effectively so
[8502.26 → 8507.78] this is a simplified example, but it's fundamentally the same thing that's why AMD divested themselves of
[8507.78 → 8514.66] their foundry business, and it seems to be doing all the better for it meanwhile intel fabs all their own
[8514.66 → 8519.38] chips and chips and has been struggling like a know after yeah
[8522.66 → 8528.90] this one's from AJ I'm currently at work running a SMT slash AIO machine while watching wad how did
[8528.90 → 8533.86] you like running a SMT machine and making your own ram at micron oh it was awesome was that the first
[8533.86 → 8540.74] time you've ever seen the process no, no the first time I saw the process was at um meridian actually i
[8540.74 → 8545.70] think that was the first time I saw it up close because they make all the boards for their
[8545.70 → 8552.82] audio products in-house um because they apparently haven't learned about the benefits of working with
[8552.82 → 8558.90] third parties um and their products are really expensive to go figure uh so no that wasn't the
[8558.90 → 8563.22] first time I've ever seen it, but it was the first time I've ever gotten to run the machinery and like
[8563.22 → 8568.58] really like poke and prod at it and get all the solder paste um in the right spots and all that kind of
[8568.58 → 8571.30] stuff it was exactly the kind of thing that I geek out over
[8574.66 → 8580.34] all right got one here from Andrew hi Linus and Luke watcher since the million subscriber days if given
[8580.34 → 8585.46] the choice today provided that you keep all your current memories would you go back 10 years and
[8585.46 → 8591.78] repeat those years again would you do anything different I don't think I would want to do it again
[8591.78 → 8602.74] 10 years of leg man I would unquestionably go back I would press that button immediately really oh yeah
[8602.74 → 8609.14] what would you change like hard I'd potentially break it would you keep your current body or the
[8609.14 → 8615.70] 10 year ago body add a modifier to that is that a question yeah is that part of the question no
[8615.70 → 8621.54] it's not okay you would go back and do it again oh yeah you didn't raise three kids in that
[8621.54 → 8628.90] time no right yeah that might change the answer okay yeah but I didn't so like yeah I'm pressing the
[8628.90 → 8636.58] button that doesn't have that's not on my side of the table i yeah oh yeah and like what would I change
[8636.58 → 8641.78] lots of stuff I don't know I don't want to get like too specific, but oh yeah like what do you mean
[8641.78 → 8650.58] the min maxing opportunities you keep all your memories that's a lot of knowledge yeahs like what
[8650.58 → 8656.58] if I knew everywhere that things were going to go in the market and stuff and I could set up our like
[8656.58 → 8664.18] video production path to be more well aimed like I wouldn't want to make major changes because you
[8664.18 → 8669.22] don't want to risk like breaking the whole system okay but here's a hypothetical because I know you've
[8669.22 → 8675.38] gone through this before have you ever written a video script lost your save file and gone back
[8675.38 → 8682.02] and tried to write it again is it always better oh no that's that's what I'm saying I wouldn't want
[8682.02 → 8686.18] to make major changes yeah but how would you avoid it you because that's the problem with trying to
[8686.18 → 8691.70] rewrite a script is you don't remember what you did right I'd still do it I'm still doing it I'm still
[8691.70 → 8696.50] pressing the button I understand there are problems I'm still doing it there's so much there's so much you
[8696.50 → 8701.94] could min max and I think you would create new problems but I think you would solve more problems
[8701.94 → 8706.18] than you would create I know there are things I don't I'm not going into it, I'm just and there's
[8706.18 → 8711.06] no you're not going to peer pressure me into going into it there are things that I would change that
[8711.06 → 8716.90] would result in better future unquestionably okay all right and like I think that's got to be true
[8717.62 → 8725.30] for pretty much everybody 10 years is a huge amount of time and there are mistakes in that amount
[8725.30 → 8731.14] of time yeah so it's Conrad I'd press the button and buy bitcoin yeah welcome to now being a multi
[8731.14 → 8737.78] billionaire because 10 years ago when we're in the Ltd studio at CX I actually tell us to start
[8737.78 → 8742.74] mining like crazy and I don't back down which i very willingly did because I agreed with you that i
[8742.74 → 8747.14] thought it was just not going anywhere okay, and we start mining like nuts and you and i both put
[8747.14 → 8752.02] everything we can in bitcoin what about this now we big ballers see that is not a minor change
[8752.02 → 8759.46] that's a major change what if we hold on hold on no come on help me out just bear with me
[8760.42 → 8768.66] what if we became total assholes we wouldn't what if we did we wouldn't what if we did I can what if
[8768.66 → 8773.14] that amount of money go down that if you want, but we would what if that amount of money changed us
[8773.14 → 8782.02] you are very wealthy I wasn't going to go here, but you kept pushing it you are very wealthy
[8784.10 → 8788.58] all right has it changed you too much we went there I mean you've made the argument that it's
[8788.58 → 8794.98] changed me more than you'd like sure okay if we're having this conversation then we're having this
[8794.98 → 8801.14] conversation fine let's lay it all on the table I didn't think we were going to go there well you started
[8801.14 → 8810.90] it you started it you started it I don't think it's changed you at the level
[8812.58 → 8820.58] that you were basically warning about right there but what if it did you press the button when you said
[8820.58 → 8827.54] that look you hold on you've talked about how motivated you are personally by adversity
[8827.54 → 8834.34] yeah by having to go hard yeah don't you think that that kind of wealth we're talking a billion
[8834.34 → 8838.98] dollar wealth potentially don't you think that that would take some of the fun out of it
[8838.98 → 8845.14] what if hunting was as simple as just pressing a button and the animal dies i know stuff
[8845.14 → 8847.54] that I would do with it that would still be motivating
[8847.54 → 8855.22] if it's unlimited does that not does that not take out the thrill of the chase though
[8855.22 → 8860.50] you know these finances don't interest me a ton yes I do know that so there are things that I would do
[8860.50 → 8867.30] with it that I know current people that are billionaires are not doing with it that I would
[8867.30 → 8872.34] do with it because I actually like don't really care okay but would we work together on that what if we lost
[8872.34 → 8880.18] that there that's my question I feel like you potentially trade our relationship for a billion
[8880.18 → 8886.90] dollars well I feel like we wouldn't and a multiple of my reasons there is again you are very wealthy
[8886.90 → 8895.94] you don't have to do this yes at all right you do this because you want to provide these types of
[8895.94 → 8900.50] things you're very motivated by the lab because you think the lab should exist well of course it should
[8900.50 → 8905.30] you think it's a good resource for like humanity it needs to exist yeah you're gonna not build the
[8905.30 → 8907.38] lab because you have a billion dollars well i
[8911.38 → 8914.90] you're still going to build a lab you're still motivated by the same things
[8916.10 → 8921.54] but it wouldn't, it be boring I don't think it'd be boring I don't think the fight for survival is
[8921.54 → 8928.18] what makes us get up in the morning I don't think you're fighting for survival and I'm well not for mine
[8928.18 → 8934.34] but that's the thing is if I had a billion dollars then like you wouldn't just give it to everybody
[8934.34 → 8935.54] i kind of wouldn't have to care
[8938.18 → 8942.82] like it, but you also wouldn't just give it to everybody well you've also seen my mentality change
[8942.82 → 8950.18] too though like i was definitely i I was more of a min maker in terms of our spend as a company in
[8950.18 → 8960.42] the early days yes and I think that admittedly yes I have a significant amount of personal wealth okay
[8961.22 → 8966.26] I was I really wasn't trying to I think it's changed my attitude significantly yeah I also think
[8966.26 → 8971.14] though that it's to a certain level as companies grow you have to do things that are less efficient
[8971.14 → 8977.22] with finances that's true and that's that's been a really tough thing for both me and Yvonne because
[8977.22 → 8985.46] me we're and Luke even though he's spending my money or whatever right even though he's not spending
[8985.46 → 8992.74] money that affects him personally I think Luke is probably one of the people I'd say top five for me
[8993.30 → 8999.86] one of the most affected people by spending not his own money, and it's a really valuable trait
[8999.86 → 9004.82] and I'm sorry I'm talking about you like you're not here, but it's a really valuable trait because people
[9004.82 → 9012.42] who spend someone else's money as if it's their own are people who just can see the bigger picture
[9013.06 → 9021.70] because the bigger picture is theoretically at some point by improving efficiency it will benefit all
[9021.70 → 9027.30] of us, and you know what I think there's a lot of people who are cynical and jaded enough from their
[9027.30 → 9034.50] real experiences in the world that they don't believe in that anymore but I can tell you for me, it's a
[9034.50 → 9039.86] really valuable trait because it means that I could trust you to do it maybe not the way I would have
[9039.86 → 9046.26] done it but a perfect way, and it's really hard to find it's super hard to find and companies need
[9046.26 → 9053.14] that by the way I want to apologize to the person that I said was dumb apparently they mis phrased
[9053.14 → 9058.82] it i I saw their chat that twitch chat just like it was a little much I think you should maybe not read
[9058.82 → 9064.34] live chats during the show I just shouldn't read twitch chat float plane chat's pretty good um but
[9065.06 → 9069.70] basically they were saying that if you hired a superstar from somewhere else and then they
[9069.70 → 9074.74] didn't perform in your environment then that's on you which is an entirely different point
[9077.06 → 9084.34] there are aspects to that that could be on you, but that's also not entirely on you yes um yeah anywho um
[9084.34 → 9093.38] uh so Luke would save all the budgies with bitcoin it's probably not entirely untrue um
[9094.74 → 9099.54] yeah I don't know I would press it I understand there are pitfalls I do understand there are pitfalls
[9101.06 → 9106.66] but I've always had this idea like i if I could go back to being like five
[9106.66 → 9115.54] yeah if I somehow knew what I currently know I would do it 100 okay
[9117.86 → 9123.70] all right yeah I don't think I would I I told, and you know what when this conversation when this
[9123.70 → 9128.42] question came in the reason why I looked at you and smiled was I knew you would say no and I knew i
[9128.42 → 9135.62] was going to say yes part of it's a philosophical thing for me like I don't believe in regret um I don't
[9135.62 → 9141.94] i i I there are certainly things I would have done differently but part of the way that I just like
[9141.94 → 9148.82] keep going every day is by looking forward not looking backward and I feel like for me, it would
[9148.82 → 9158.74] actually be a very demotivating experience to have to live back through um a lot of
[9158.74 → 9168.90] yeah I wouldn't want to live it again I get that and I can understand how my stance on it makes it
[9168.90 → 9175.78] sound like I live in regret I think living in regret is an terrible thing to do, and you can't work
[9175.78 → 9182.34] that way I don't think it's regret I think it's just desire to like well you're the king of min maxing
[9182.34 → 9188.02] exactly I get if it's that it's not regret I think i I think I've done great I'm actually like very happy
[9188.02 → 9193.54] with where I'm at and how things are going like i live's good I don't have a lot of regrets made
[9193.54 → 9198.66] mistakes, but everybody's made mistakes so whatever yeah like it's just so then why why why I think it'd
[9198.66 → 9205.22] be fun oh I think it'd be really fun I think the min maxing aspect would be great because I have all
[9205.22 → 9212.02] my memories I there's also tons I forgot yeah but I'd, I'd screw it up I literally forgot an entire video
[9212.02 → 9218.10] we just yeah we just filmed that thing right like i almost certainly i I feel like I would almost
[9218.10 → 9224.18] certainly screw it up you think so yeah because there's been so many times that I've been at a
[9224.18 → 9233.38] crossroads and I've gone like even knowing the result I could go back and I could take that other
[9233.38 → 9239.46] path, and it could be worse I think if I think is I was the only one I think what I would do was I
[9239.46 → 9248.50] wouldn't tell anyone that you know I wouldn't tell anyone that I know anything okay but then would
[9248.50 → 9253.14] that come across like kind of arrogant just like I know and I'm not going to tell you how I know would
[9253.14 → 9261.14] you be a different person I don't think so it's its harder to not change we can't just will ourselves
[9261.14 → 9266.50] to be who we want to be I understand and i and i and I didn't to be clear the wording there was specific
[9266.50 → 9273.30] I didn't say no I said I didn't think so yeah okay I don't think so I don't know but I don't think
[9273.30 → 9274.66] like i also
[9277.14 → 9286.98] I also don't think that your success has changed you I think that you are able to spend a dollar now
[9286.98 → 9293.06] without having anxiety I still struggle a little bit I think that's a positive change yeah but I've
[9293.06 → 9298.02] I've seen you make frivolous purchases when I met you there was no such thing as a frivolous purchase
[9298.58 → 9305.46] like its different yeah but just like couldn't afford toothpaste, but you can be different without
[9305.46 → 9310.26] changing yeah I guess is what I'm trying to say and i and i think you've done a good job of that
[9310.26 → 9317.30] but I think that a billion dollars is a lot it is I didn't to be fair when I first said i and my
[9317.30 → 9323.06] opinion does not change i I think the bitcoin thing was Conrad's idea I didn't even think about
[9323.06 → 9328.66] it yeah, but it's a good point and if I did press the button it is probably something that I would do
[9328.66 → 9333.62] because yeah if the scenarios are almost identical you and I are going to be in that studio yeah and
[9333.62 → 9337.30] we're going to be talking about it's going to be a bunch of GPUs sitting there hey do we use these to
[9337.30 → 9342.50] my this is a yeah we've talked about this on my show a few times, but we had a bunch of really high-end
[9342.50 → 9350.90] GPUs we had literally these like multi-platform bench systems yes that are exactly
[9350.90 → 9354.98] what people use to mine on sitting there just sitting, and we were like hey we
[9354.98 → 9359.38] could do this, and we were like lol you know that company doesn't exist any more anyway so I guess i
[9359.38 → 9362.10] can talk about them, but we're like we'll just run it in here you get free power
[9364.50 → 9369.94] um we've changed a little I like to think neither of us would do that any more yeah yeah yeah
[9372.74 → 9378.02] that's one thing that changed once I had money I insist on paying for things now yes me too
[9378.02 → 9382.74] like I actually do insist on paying for things I went back and bought a bunch of games that i
[9382.74 → 9387.86] pirated and stuff I did that quite a while ago I've had people I've had people comp try to comp me meals
[9387.86 → 9393.38] and I just leave money on the table like i just i I won't I I won't, I can afford to pay
[9394.26 → 9398.66] my stir in float plane chat said you wouldn't spend the money from bitcoin though so what's the point
[9398.66 → 9403.54] uh I wouldn't spend it on myself that's like and I genuinely believe that I actually don't
[9403.54 → 9407.54] I actually believe that too yeah I know how much money he makes yeah
[9412.18 → 9413.22] this shirt was free
[9415.54 → 9419.38] I have new socks I have new socks you did buy new socks i only sort of approve of them
[9419.38 → 9425.78] we talked about this after the show literally true I was like full disappointed dad but trying
[9425.78 → 9431.38] to be supportive i I like them a little bit less since then but I still like them a lot I was trying
[9431.38 → 9436.74] not to be a downer I'm sorry okay that uh yeah this is part of the reason why I would press the button
[9436.74 → 9441.30] is because I have always had this stance that it is always better to know painful information is still
[9441.30 → 9445.70] better and that's why I'm honest with you because if you were anyone else I would have been like oh my
[9445.70 → 9454.74] gosh those are so nice I love them hold on I can actually do that more convincing uh okay no way
[9454.74 → 9460.66] after all that after all the time we spent talking about socks you finally did it that was actually
[9460.66 → 9468.66] pretty convincing I can usually catch up I there's I have a really hard time watching videos of you when
[9468.66 → 9475.30] you're talking about like a product or something that I know you're not interested in because I think you
[9475.30 → 9480.98] convince people pretty well but no yeah I see it immediately, and then it's like painful for me to
[9480.98 → 9485.70] watch because I know it's painful for you so the whole time I'm watching I'm just like oh that's why
[9485.70 → 9490.26] I just don't do it anymore yeah it's like there was a while there I think like two three years ago where
[9490.26 → 9495.46] you're doing it a lot yeah and like well I was covering what I thought I should be covering yeah notice
[9495.46 → 9505.14] I just don't bother reviewing the iPhone any more yeah I don't care it's uh it's an iPhone apple by design
[9505.62 → 9512.02] makes it change as little as possible generation by generation so that dumb dumb who can't handle
[9512.02 → 9519.78] a button moving are not going to get confused like for real that's actually in it's it's a core
[9519.78 → 9524.34] part of the design philosophy of the product and so it's inherently boring now
[9524.34 → 9527.46] yeah um
[9529.94 → 9535.14] I don't know like something that I thought of quite a while ago i I know there are a lot of things that i
[9535.14 → 9540.74] would do you know how I did it just now though I made what I was talking about something how I felt
[9540.74 → 9549.14] instead of the product that's what I did interest that's what makes it convincing yeah, yeah so I mean i
[9549.14 → 9553.70] guess what I'm doing right now is I'm outing myself as someone who can lie convincingly which is
[9553.70 → 9562.10] bad I already knew that well yeah I guess so I don't want to that's that's that's key and I will
[9562.10 → 9568.50] give you this credit I think you very rarely do I only do if I have to so there there are situations
[9568.50 → 9573.86] like and honestly a lot of the time I'm really uncomfortable with it but like as an employer you
[9573.86 → 9581.06] actually cannot always be honest with someone um like legally um, and it's its really
[9581.06 → 9591.38] frustrating for me one of the ones in particular is that if you in bc in Canada if you dismiss
[9591.38 → 9600.50] someone with cause there is a lot more uh legal liability for your company and therefore for your
[9600.50 → 9607.46] entire team then if you simply dismiss someone without cause and just like put together a
[9607.46 → 9614.02] severance package and be like okay see you later um if they come to you, and they say hey what was it
[9614.02 → 9620.66] was it my was it my awful performance here was it the time theft I committed here like even if it
[9620.66 → 9627.14] doesn't matter how legit the reason is the best thing to do every lawyer I've ever talked to has said
[9627.14 → 9633.30] you cannot answer those questions so like from a legal liability standpoint I can't give
[9633.30 → 9643.06] people honest feedback I like giving honest feedback because I like receiving honest feedback I think that
[9643.06 → 9649.14] an environment of openness and honesty is more constructive for everyone involved even if you're
[9649.14 → 9655.78] you're partying ways yeah if I was getting dumped by okay let's say my wife divorced me okay let's say
[9655.78 → 9664.82] Yvonne left me I want to know why I don't want to I don't want to lose a lady like that again if i ever
[9664.82 → 9674.58] find one again right so i I find that kind of thing extremely difficult yeah um
[9674.58 → 9682.18] yeah I mean i I mean a big part of it too is just I find the truth is just more effective
[9682.82 → 9688.26] like if you want to enact any kind of change in your life dishonesty ain't going to do it
[9689.86 → 9694.34] yeah, and you can package things better like you don't have to be an ass about it yeah
[9696.10 → 9701.14] like that I don't know that's a thing but like, or maybe you want to be depends on the context
[9701.14 → 9705.70] but like you can package things in different ways to try to accomplish different
[9705.70 → 9712.98] goals while still being very clear and truthful about what you're saying yeah that went a weird
[9712.98 → 9718.42] path but anyway I'd press the button this is great Von Bauer fiend says big employer talking about time
[9718.42 → 9728.82] theft eye roll so what it doesn't exist the other way you've never known anyone who said they worked
[9728.82 → 9734.66] eight hours but didn't really yeah you're right that doesn't exist probably cool
[9737.22 → 9742.82] uh what was I going to say oh yeah uh I will also say while saying that I would press the button
[9742.82 → 9747.54] and this isn't even I'm not even being judgmental I think it would be very bad for a large amount of
[9747.54 → 9750.26] people but I think I would be fine
[9750.26 → 9759.38] hit us Dan I don't know how this has become how are we going to follow that one
[9760.82 → 9768.98] oh my gosh it's good uh-huh okay this one's from Jonathan uh Capcom has released two LCS for monster
[9768.98 → 9774.34] hunter that would delete your save if you didn't purchase them twice monster hunter world ice borne and
[9774.34 → 9781.78] monster hunter rise sun break didn't purchase if you did not that's outrageous it deletes your save
[9782.66 → 9790.50] that should be considered time theft i invested my time in this save file you
[9790.50 → 9797.62] can't you can't hold it hostage that's ridiculous I mean does it surprise us it's Capcom like
[9797.62 → 9806.34] we give blizzard a lot of flack and Nintendo a lot of flack for being anti-consumer but like
[9807.30 → 9811.06] cap Capcom should be right there in the conversation they're not exactly
[9812.42 → 9819.22] no cap okay thank you get it thank you for that that was really helpful oh shoot I think I just archived
[9819.22 → 9824.18] one by accident because Dan and I went for the button at the same time uh-oh uh if you do it they moved for
[9824.18 → 9831.46] me um yeah, and he asked hi Linus and Luke I'm curious to know how many team members use the 2016
[9831.46 → 9836.98] razor blades you gifted around the holidays than best of luck in 2023 mine still works your
[9836.98 → 9840.98] still works, but you don't use it that wasn't the question I don't use it because I was super sketched
[9840.98 → 9847.14] out about its looming death because it's pretty old at this point yeah like it's genuinely very old
[9847.14 → 9855.22] at this point for a laptop um and I was going on a trip for two weeks and I was yeah sure I'm on
[9855.22 → 9860.90] vacation I'm definitely going to have to work while I'm on the trip um even if it wasn't the work for
[9860.90 → 9864.50] the work that I was doing on the trip like even during my vacation portion and I was going to have to
[9864.50 → 9869.86] work so I was like if I'm lugging this around in a bag for two weeks am I convinced it's going to work
[9869.86 → 9876.34] the whole time no so I got a different one I don't think anyone still uses them but my uh my
[9876.34 → 9881.14] girlfriend uses it now oh okay so it's still deployed it is still in use yeah uh we've got
[9881.14 → 9885.30] a couple good ones here um this is the one I accidentally archived I haven't got my black shaft
[9885.30 → 9890.26] driver yet but I know I need these bits as I work in the automation industry any chance of hollow
[9890.26 → 9896.34] ground screwdriver bits I have never heard of a hollow ground screwdriver bit but if you contact
[9896.34 → 9900.90] LTC support they will eventually they're actually doing a great job they're getting caught up on
[9900.90 → 9906.10] tickets um so if you contact LTC support with your suggestion just tell them I said to message
[9906.34 → 9912.58] uh forward it to kyle I've basically he has a blank check to get any tooling done or any
[9913.22 → 9919.94] anything any setup done for any bits I want to I want to support every bit so there you go these
[9919.94 → 9925.86] are incredible um a hollow ground bit also known as a hollow tip or parallel ground screwdriver the
[9925.86 → 9931.78] straight slotted tip fills the screw slot better than the tapered tip on standard screwdrivers for more
[9931.78 → 9938.26] torque and less slippage cool that sounds great let's do it um also I've got from idea Katz over
[9938.26 → 9944.26] on float plane hey Linus if I say trust me bro I'm not going to sue you would you give me honest feedback
[9944.26 → 9955.14] after firing me we actually did that once um someone didn't make it here um and i kind of i for whatever
[9955.14 → 9960.26] reason normally it's not actually me anymore like there are multiple layers of management and hr and
[9960.26 → 9965.38] stuff at this point so it's almost never me who actually has a dismissal conversation with someone
[9965.38 → 9972.42] uh but i i I talked to this person um we worked directly so that's probably why I don't remember the
[9972.42 → 9979.30] details the point is that um I talked to this person uh it was tough conversation because they really just
[9979.30 → 9986.90] wanted to do better and I really wanted them to do better I liked them as a person right like it was
[9986.90 → 9992.98] it just wasn't the right fit and sometimes that happens right and uh they basically were like
[9992.98 → 9998.90] well how do we how do we overcome this because I kept having to say look I can't
[9999.70 → 10004.58] I can't really I can't, I can't really talk about anything other than to say look it's not the right fit
[10004.58 → 10008.82] and they're like well yeah but why you know how do I make how do I be the right fit somewhere else
[10008.82 → 10017.30] and I'm like oh I get it um so the deal we ultimately reached um and I think this was their
[10017.30 → 10026.98] idea actually was they basically said look if i if i like sign the whatever dismissal documentation
[10027.62 → 10038.10] um then, and we wait a little while can we just like jump on discord and can you just maybe not
[10039.14 → 10045.54] maybe not tell me you know why I was dismissed or whatever but why don't we why don't we go through
[10045.54 → 10052.82] a project uh together, and you can just critique it very honestly that way it's not that and I'm like
[10052.82 → 10058.50] okay so we set aside a couple of hours, and we had a chat on discord a few weeks later after all the
[10058.50 → 10063.86] paperwork was done and everything was settled um that's the one exception that I have made
[10063.86 → 10071.78] uh to that because I felt that that person really trust me bro was not interested in making it a
[10071.78 → 10077.06] legal problem I was going to say that's still technically a very sketchy I know thing I know
[10077.06 → 10082.82] but they really wanted to know and i I respect it i I totally respect it I'm just saying I respect it
[10082.82 → 10089.06] too people shouldn't they shouldn't expect that all well no I like oh sorry I misunderstood I meant like i
[10089.06 → 10095.94] like i I respect that person for that too for wanting that feedback for craving self-improvement
[10095.94 → 10101.94] like that's the thing is so many people I've met over the years do not desire self-improvement so
[10101.94 → 10112.02] how do you talk to people like that it's really tough okay hey prime colton keeps getting
[10112.02 → 10118.18] fired and getting severance packages that's how you own so much property that's hilarious no Colton's
[10118.18 → 10126.50] actually just a really really really um like senior person to you now like the firing memes are just
[10126.50 → 10135.86] memes uh Colton's like yeah he's he's he's good yeah love Colton hashtag love Colton okay I'm trying
[10135.86 → 10140.98] to replace my hard drive circuit board and I was trying to figure out which extra bit set would work
[10140.98 → 10147.86] for it also do you guys plan on adding an extra bit set holder to go with the screwdriver yes we do
[10147.86 → 10153.14] but we're not gonna I actually had that meeting with the creator warehouse team today one of the new
[10153.14 → 10158.10] toolmakers was like hey we've seen a lot of these alto ids mods people just like modifying an alto ids
[10158.10 → 10163.30] tin to hold the screwdriver they're really cool actually why don't we just like to do that for now as
[10163.30 → 10168.74] a MVP minimum viable product, and then we'll do like the perfect one later I'm like you're new here
[10170.18 → 10176.58] we're not going to do that we're going to do the awesome one and in the meantime we can by all means
[10176.58 → 10181.30] you know boost people talking about putting them in alto ids tins or whatever else sure let's shine
[10181.30 → 10185.70] some light on that but no we're just going to do it properly okay and the last one I have here
[10185.70 → 10191.94] curated is from Charles since you're talking about labour any thoughts on the U.S. rail strike and whole
[10191.94 → 10197.46] mismanagement extravaganza oh that whole thing should be illegal like I've made my I've made my
[10197.46 → 10201.86] thoughts on unionization here very clear I would consider it a personal failure and I've had a lot
[10201.86 → 10209.30] of people attack me with that but I think they are i I think it's one of those bad faith interpretations
[10209.30 → 10215.70] um the way that I mean it is very clear I think it would be a failure on my part because it would
[10215.70 → 10221.94] mean that people I feel like me saying it for you would help sure which is why I was going to jump in
[10221.94 → 10226.66] by I'm pretty sure it's accurate you can tell me if it's not sure if he wants to treat people well enough
[10226.66 → 10232.18] that they don't actually feel like they need one if people needed protection from me that's a person
[10232.18 → 10238.10] that sucks yeah that means I suck I think unions are incredibly important and i I feel like they're
[10238.10 → 10246.74] they're on a rise because there's been a lot of um extremely poor treatment of workers yeah for a
[10246.74 → 10252.18] long time now absolutely people are tired of it and when you push people that far they start to form
[10252.18 → 10256.58] groups so they can support each other and that's good, and you're seeing a lot of good happening like
[10256.58 → 10261.54] the Starbucks union there's all this information about what they've been up to and the like wars that
[10261.54 → 10266.98] they've been fighting as for what happened with the U.S. rail strike that should be illegal yeah just
[10266.98 → 10271.62] legislating if is they're important enough that you can legislate them back to work then they're
[10271.62 → 10279.14] important enough that you can probably pay them properly yeah like that's that's crazy so yeah
[10283.30 → 10284.90] yeah, yeah cool
[10284.90 → 10294.82] okay I think you know there's some incoming if you want to address those otherwise um I'm out oh let me
[10294.82 → 10303.78] have a look here um it's not even any potentials' oh I see still oh incoming oh still reeling from the
[10303.78 → 10308.90] recent near miss what are your thoughts on the tech layoffs recently wild right did you see Amazon's laying
[10308.90 → 10315.70] off 18 000 people that is an unfathomable and unfathomable number of people to employ I was
[10315.70 → 10323.14] going to say in the first place company's worth of people that that is wild yeah um yeah uh like
[10323.14 → 10330.58] we're still hiring, but we ain't going to be picking up that kind of slack yeah that's yeah yeah it's
[10330.58 → 10335.78] terrifying right now there are quite a few companies that are hiring right now though um AGI is a big thing
[10335.78 → 10342.98] there are a lot of new AGI startups and stuff maybe check it out um yeah I don't know um I know people
[10342.98 → 10349.38] are very worried about developer jobs and 18 000 people joining the pool is not going to make it
[10349.38 → 10354.26] super easy but something that I think people have to understand is developers were in such insane
[10354.26 → 10360.66] demand before this happened it's not like they're not in demand any more there's still really high
[10360.66 → 10367.86] salary jobs that are being offered um i think it'll be okay I think it'll be okay uh Muppet
[10367.86 → 10372.58] puppet I don't fully understand your question I'm sorry so I'm just going to click show, and it might show
[10372.58 → 10379.22] up there um something about would you use different cables and maybe someone else in chat can see it and
[10379.22 → 10381.30] maybe respond to it um
[10381.30 → 10391.22] I just finished building the pc my dad and I specked out before he died what is your favourite memory you
[10391.22 → 10396.42] have with your parents my parents watch this show that's a lot of pressure that's heavy um want me
[10396.42 → 10403.30] to go first sure okay uh I don't know and your turn no, no okay I'll try and come up with something
[10403.30 → 10409.86] um it's hard to pick a favourite right like that's how do you how do you possibly pick a favourite
[10409.86 → 10414.90] memory from the people who raised you I mean there are so many little moments of like
[10415.94 → 10420.18] you know imparting whether it's imparting wisdom or you know supporting you at a really
[10420.18 → 10422.26] you know awful time or whatever else like
[10422.26 → 10438.82] yeah holy smokes what are you even yeah okay no I got nothing I'm sorry I think I feel like these
[10438.82 → 10444.02] would change depending on the day or hour that you asked me I think my dad's is pretty cemented
[10444.82 → 10451.70] when he gave you the talk my mom's my mom gave me the talk not my dad um well okay when he tried
[10452.26 → 10459.38] uh my dad it's its the same kind of thing, but there's there are two moments um
[10460.98 → 10466.74] we weren't like the wealthiest growing up so one of my buddies and I would often scrounge together some
[10466.74 → 10471.06] dollars that him and I would make by doing random odd jobs around to rent video games we didn't own
[10471.06 → 10476.66] like a big i I would go over friends houses, and they'd have like a shelf of games for their n64 or
[10476.66 → 10481.94] whatever I'd be like that's crazy like we have probably not the n64 right now how would you even
[10481.94 → 10488.42] play all those games that too like yeah, but you definitely know that you could um so we would rent
[10488.42 → 10496.02] games with the little money that we got right and man I don't want to like dox myself and where my
[10496.02 → 10501.86] parents live so I can't exactly describe this but the walk when you don't have a car yet to the game
[10501.86 → 10505.70] rental store because your buddy doesn't have a bike because he was dropped off there by his parents
[10505.70 → 10513.38] car so you only have one bike so you walk uh back then it was really long uh one time the store that
[10513.38 → 10518.90] we wanted to get the game from because the clothes store didn't have it was I think an hour and a half
[10518.90 → 10526.34] long one direction so it took us three hours to get this game which was epic um but one of the games
[10526.34 → 10532.42] that we rented was borrowing oh that was a bit of a game changer for you pretty big deal I had never done
[10532.42 → 10538.34] this before but the morning after I ran up and like woke my dad up early which was probably not
[10538.34 → 10544.74] the start for the question that I was going to give him um but I enthusiastically described the game
[10545.38 → 10552.98] and was like it's amazing I really want to get it and for some reason again we were like super broke
[10552.98 → 10559.38] and this is not something that we like often did, but he was like okay I'm getting up and I was like what
[10559.38 → 10564.26] and then like ran out, and he got up got dressed we went and bought borrowing and I was like what the
[10564.26 → 10570.82] heck and then not so much the friend that I played it with and i but my dad and I ended up playing a
[10570.82 → 10576.02] ludicrous amount of that game together and that was like really cool I think it all comes down to time
[10576.02 → 10581.94] spent together like if I was going to pick some memories like you know it might be uh the cross-country trip
[10581.94 → 10591.38] with my mom we I got my license and literally from the Canadian equivalent of the DMV I got in the car
[10592.10 → 10598.74] and I went for the passenger seat, and she's like excuse me I don't drive anymore and I was like this is
[10598.74 → 10606.50] a standard automobile, and she's like then I guess you better figure out how to drive stick
[10606.50 → 10613.38] and I stalled several times in the parking lot and then I drove to Halifax and back um which
[10613.38 → 10618.34] which was pretty cool right yeah there were some there was some tension on the trip my mother who
[10618.34 → 10625.14] doesn't watch this show is not always the easiest to get along with and neither am I I am just like her
[10628.02 → 10632.90] which is which has been an uncomfortable realization as I've made my way into adulthood
[10632.90 → 10639.30] um it's especially hard to hear from Yvonne who has a fraught relationship or has had a fraught
[10639.30 → 10645.30] relationship with my mother over the years at times uh anywho uh and then like you know with my dad
[10645.30 → 10650.98] it's its maybe like simpler things I don't know if we ever did anything like that big uh, but it's like
[10650.98 → 10658.34] little things like uh like my dad has had this enthusiasm that is just infectious he's he's definitely
[10658.34 → 10663.94] where I get my charisma from no offence mother um what I have what of it I have and i I'm a
[10663.94 → 10670.74] watered down version of both of them in a lot of ways i I don't have his zest for life um and so the
[10670.74 → 10677.06] kinds of things I remember with him are uh, and you'll probably appreciate this because he was all about
[10677.06 → 10683.30] just like doing things hard so I remember going to Disneyland um, and it's one of my earliest memories i
[10683.30 → 10690.10] was like four I remember going to Disneyland, and it was sprinkling rain that day and he basically
[10691.38 → 10698.02] like like like ran around the park like cheerleading me to like to run onto all the rides because it was
[10698.02 → 10703.86] unbelievable like in California you know you get like three drops of rain and everybody runs inside
[10703.86 → 10710.26] right, and we're from Vancouver we's literally the nickname weather the nickname is wet coast okay
[10710.26 → 10715.46] like what do we care about some rain uh, and you know those are the things that stand out to
[10715.46 → 10720.66] you even all these decades later and like Halloween Halloween with my dad was an experience if you
[10720.66 → 10729.14] think kids like Halloween you have not met my father because he would drag me from door to door
[10729.14 → 10736.02] like let's go what are you walking for do you want candy or not yeah there's candy, and it's not because he
[10736.02 → 10740.10] was he wasn't even one of those parents that like would eat all the candy he was just like
[10740.98 → 10746.90] rude you've got three hours yeah well how much candy are you going to get, and he would and when we'd
[10746.90 → 10752.18] get home he would put it on the scale for me, and he would like he would like to hype me up that yeah we got
[10752.18 → 10760.98] like we got like six pounds this year you know, and we would like we went man um and like and again he
[10760.98 → 10768.50] would run you know he'd run with me and do things like that so it's i I think time spent is um yeah
[10768.50 → 10774.74] like i something that i something that I got from my dad is just the ridiculous drive that he has when
[10774.74 → 10782.18] he has something that he deems worthy of the drive he didn't get all of it he's unbelievable 100 he's
[10782.18 → 10787.30] unbelievable yeah it's ridiculous there's there are certain points in my life where i actually genuinely
[10787.30 → 10793.38] functionally don't understand the like physics of how he did what he did like it is makes no sense
[10793.38 → 10802.34] nope like he would work these back-to-back jobs so he'd have like less than eight hours off
[10802.34 → 10807.54] like you should sleep right like he would work and I don't mean this would happen once or twice a week
[10807.54 → 10813.86] I mean this was every day so I remember there was I remember at least one time that he came home
[10813.86 → 10818.74] and he drove into the driveway and fell asleep in the car because he turned the car off and it
[10818.74 → 10823.70] was just immediately like, and then he woke up, and it was time to go back to work again so he turned the
[10823.70 → 10830.74] car on and left like, but he would still somehow we had this thing I don't remember exactly what it was
[10830.74 → 10839.38] called I'm sure he remembers the name yeah uh, but we would play i I would often like I think this is
[10839.38 → 10842.98] probably part of the reason why I'm a night owl but I would like to stay up until he would come home
[10842.98 → 10849.94] and he'd come home from work at like crazy hours um, but he would something that he deemed required
[10850.66 → 10856.66] was spending time with my brother and i yeah so he'd come in and be like all right it's time to like
[10856.66 → 10861.62] hang out so we'd play games until the sun came up, and then we'd go sit on the hood of his car and
[10861.62 → 10868.10] watch the sunrise nice and that's like even saying that like all the feels all the feels because like
[10868.10 → 10873.70] yeah back then I was just like this is cool and now that I'm older I'm like that dude gave up sleep
[10874.50 → 10879.78] after working very physical nutrition everything he gave up everything to be able to
[10879.78 → 10886.02] somehow spend more time with us, and then he would have to go to work yeah after just not sleeping like
[10886.02 → 10891.62] crazy you can have hockey skates or whatever else yeah and he was the coach in like yeah every sport
[10891.62 → 10896.90] that we freaking played and was like better than the other coaches that were there despite having no sleep
[10896.90 → 10901.22] and working all these jobs and doing all this kind of stuff and then i I have tons of memories of
[10901.22 → 10905.70] hanging out with my dad despite all that stuff which is crazy, and then you mentioned the time
[10905.70 → 10909.38] thing it's the same kind of deal with my mom I have tons of different memories of us going and doing
[10909.38 → 10916.98] things, and she's interested in everything you could imagine oh yeah she's had like every job i I cannot
[10916.98 → 10922.10] list all the jobs that she's had because I forget so many probably the only way to
[10922.10 → 10930.42] how do I put this the the the only thing that outnumbers the number of different jobs your mom
[10930.42 → 10934.66] has done is maybe the number of different hobbies like yeah yeah it's like that's a good way of going
[10934.66 → 10943.62] for it so like we would go to like the PNE or something and the's like talking to someone
[10943.62 → 10950.66] who's super passionate about something is basically always interesting yeah even if it's just like oh my like
[10950.66 → 10955.14] something that I don't care about like at all iconography yeah I don't care if someone's
[10955.14 → 10959.86] interested enough in that I will listen to it all about absolutely I've watched a bunch of like
[10959.86 → 10964.90] YouTube videos on some topic I've never even heard of before and genuinely don't care about but the
[10964.90 → 10969.54] person talking about it is super passionate about it perfect at it like it makes it amazingly
[10969.54 → 10974.10] interesting so we'd go to like the PNE, or we'd go to like something we'd go to some type of event or
[10974.10 → 10978.50] some type of place and just her interest in everything makes me super interested in everything
[10978.50 → 10982.58] and it's just super enjoyable and then I would try to go to one of those like by myself or with
[10982.58 → 10987.62] some friends or something and I'd be like this sucks I wish I was like it's like a weird
[10987.62 → 10991.78] thing for a kid to say but I was like i wish my mom was here yeah because like it would be way
[10991.78 → 11000.02] more interesting to do that I remember like yeah I don't know it's just yeah I don't know those
