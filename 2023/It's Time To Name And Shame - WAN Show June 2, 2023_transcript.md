[0.00 --> 12.18]  welcome to the WAN show which is pretty much guaranteed to be a disaster today based on how
[12.18 --> 19.56]  the setup has gone and the fact that there is uh i mean we can't deny what's here in between us
[19.56 --> 27.74]  today didn't notice that but we're starting the show anyway we have got a great show lined up for
[27.74 --> 36.78]  you guys the big topics are i have finally been convinced to name and shame uh the pool company
[36.78 --> 43.62]  landscaping company that i've been using and i'm going to be talking about you know why whole room
[43.62 --> 51.28]  water cooling the second has been delayed and it's uh it basically comes down to i don't want to end
[51.28 --> 57.52]  up slandering anyone so it basically comes down to in my opinion uh the way that they've handled the
[57.52 --> 64.10]  job allegedly i also want to talk about why there's been almost no gaming hardware news
[64.10 --> 72.46]  in our ltt coverage of computex um that was not an accident but it also wasn't something i can avoid
[72.46 --> 76.42]  yeah and so i'll explain that in a little bit more detail later what else we got today
[76.42 --> 82.54]  the dolphin steam launch has been postponed probably indefinitely but we'll we'll dive into that later
[82.54 --> 90.84]  and also speaking of no gaming news nvidia maybe temporarily joined the one trillion dollar club
[90.84 --> 96.10]  one trillion dollars and they definitely did not get there through gaming gpus
[96.10 --> 104.98]  take that gamers i just realized i have absolutely no way of rolling the intro yeah dan's gonna have to
[104.98 --> 106.56]  hit it sick hey
[106.56 --> 134.26]  the show is brought to you today by something presumably i wasn't able to see it
[134.26 --> 141.02]  but maybe you guys were i'm getting there backblaze squarespace and blackpoint cyber
[141.02 --> 150.82]  thank you it's been so long since we've done a wan show on site like this it's the taiwan show guys
[150.82 --> 155.98]  and i'm absolutely here for it someone pointed out in the flow plane chat that this is actually just
[155.98 --> 162.90]  a starforged logo yes so it's okay it's a hammer yeah yeah yeah it's a hammer
[162.90 --> 172.86]  it's a hammer it's right between our heads i am so sore right now and so tired guys as tired as i look
[172.86 --> 180.16]  that's how tired i am i've actually spent more time playing badminton than actually like
[180.16 --> 186.24]  i think we got if we if we collected the amount of hours we slept last night we had one
[186.24 --> 191.88]  full night of sleep yeah yeah it was pretty it was pretty rough i played for like five hours yesterday
[191.88 --> 199.52]  and this is really bad i i realized when i got a group chat this morning from the center back home
[199.52 --> 206.02]  that i'm actually signed up to play badminton on saturday again which is which is tonight which is
[206.02 --> 213.10]  tonight but also i go back in time when i go home so it's like far from now tonight but i have played
[213.10 --> 218.52]  every day um do you think you're gonna crush when you go home even though you're sore because you're
[218.52 --> 225.94]  like so warmed up against good players um you saw me try to go downstairs last yeah but i saw you
[225.94 --> 231.52]  try to go downstairs the night before as well yeah and then you found a way to play yeah so i got
[231.52 --> 239.26]  injured on the first day um if you see played through it i still played every day uh so what
[239.26 --> 245.62]  would happen was i would heal a little bit at night and then i would spend the day walking around the
[245.62 --> 254.44]  show floor like hobbling hobbling around the show floor you're like i fake it pretty well on camera
[254.44 --> 261.38]  so anything other than the gigabyte booth coverage and the uh what was it floor systems
[261.38 --> 269.34]  i'm like uh uh and uh so if you look at if you look closely at the montage of me running when we
[269.34 --> 275.50]  did the video in the uh super micro booth where we had to like go on a fetch quest to get a replacement
[275.50 --> 282.66]  cpu and ram for this blade server if you look closely i am like heavily limping in that video so i would
[282.66 --> 288.00]  hobble around the show floor and then i would go play badminton injure myself to the point of
[288.00 --> 296.72]  barely being able to lift my leg out of an uber to get out of it and then i would do rinse and repeat
[296.72 --> 304.60]  the entire trip here i've actually had a lot of fun it's been really great it's been so long since i've
[304.60 --> 312.20]  been in the thick of things and you know what it's funny because i've been seeing a lot of comments
[312.20 --> 317.70]  from people that are like yeah linus seems better he seems like he's having fun or he seems like he's
[317.70 --> 322.26]  he's chilled out or he seems like whatever you know if the content's going to be like this when the new
[322.26 --> 331.88]  ceo comes in i'm here for it and at first i was like that seems stupid uh no offense because you know
[331.88 --> 337.54]  one of the videos that had a lot of comments like that was actually the hundred thousand dollar
[337.54 --> 345.56]  minecraft pc build for carl jacobs we shot that video like three months ago yeah yeah i saw a bunch
[345.56 --> 350.70]  of videos about that on our cleaning video as well i was like hmm uh comments about that but yes yeah
[350.70 --> 357.34]  what did i say you said you saw a lot of videos about it yeah he's tired too we both went out for
[357.34 --> 362.98]  beef noodle soup at like 2 30 in the morning last night because that's a smart thing to do it was
[362.98 --> 370.14]  worth it it was really good soup yeah um anyway at first i was thinking to myself okay these guys
[370.14 --> 378.40]  are just looking for something but i gotta say i i felt creatively liberated at the show this year
[378.40 --> 384.10]  cool i didn't feel like i had to just do traditional booth coverage and honestly i didn't want to
[384.10 --> 390.26]  because i could have uploaded the same thing we would have uploaded at computex four years ago but i
[390.26 --> 394.72]  feel like the channels come a long way since then i feel like the community expectations have come a
[394.72 --> 400.88]  long way since then and i feel like the industry has changed a lot since then i will talk about the
[400.88 --> 407.30]  the pool thing i know that's our headline topic but i actually want to talk about this other topic
[407.30 --> 414.18]  first and this was almost going to be a rainwalk video i might still write it up and shoot it before
[414.18 --> 419.16]  we leave but i want to talk through some of the thoughts that i had just here on the wan show because
[419.16 --> 432.04]  you guys probably noticed right we shot almost nothing this year in in terms of pc gaming like for the ltt channel
[432.04 --> 438.98]  i mean noctua had has that really cool offset uh mounting bar thing so you can you can drop your
[438.98 --> 445.62]  temperatures a little bit on am5 cpus by by actually moving the cooler down to where the ccds are under the
[445.62 --> 456.96]  ihs and other than that our first video was nvidia's grace super chip and grace hopper data center our second
[456.96 --> 467.52]  video is floor systems cooling which okay if this matures the way that they think they can
[467.52 --> 477.02]  wow it's going to be an absolute game changer for gaming laptops yeah but if the view rates on laptop
[477.02 --> 483.52]  videos are anything to go by from you guys i'm i'm thinking you mostly care about desktops and i just
[483.52 --> 490.64]  i i don't see this technology making its way into the desktop in any yeah me neither realistic amount
[490.64 --> 495.34]  of time like just from a cost perspective it won't make sense because you don't need the benefits
[495.34 --> 502.82]  you don't need the size benefit so why are you paying for it right um the noctua cooler oh right
[502.82 --> 508.40]  then super micro super micro was one of the other really interesting things at the show uh these these
[508.40 --> 515.10]  microblade servers did you watch this video no okay these are super cool because instead of using server
[515.10 --> 525.12]  cpus they're just ryzens and so instead of going multi-socket they're just blades with full ryzen
[525.12 --> 533.10]  pcs so it's a 3u rack with eight full computers in it and you can put up to ryzen 7950x 3ds
[533.10 --> 539.52]  so if you wanted to do like a high performance game server like like top tier single threaded
[539.52 --> 545.64]  performance this is it and you can still you know slice them up and virtualize them because
[545.64 --> 552.32]  you know it just occurred to me why not i don't think we're grateful enough that virtualization for
[552.32 --> 556.30]  i i thought this would be a really interesting thing to dig into in a tech quickie or something
[556.30 --> 562.18]  like that how did we end up with proper virtualization support on the desktop it is kind
[562.18 --> 567.24]  of surprised that hasn't been a gated feature at some point well i think it was at some point
[567.24 --> 575.82]  oh i think in the early days it was like i'm trying to think like sriov i don't think was something
[575.82 --> 581.08]  that even if it was supported by the cpus i think motherboard manufacturers weren't implementing
[581.08 --> 585.80]  it into the into their bioses i know ilmmu is something that has matured a lot over the last
[585.80 --> 591.94]  10 years oh okay so it's been a minute but yeah like intel core 2 duo apparently had some issues okay
[591.94 --> 598.38]  yeah yeah so there you go the fact that we ended up with that is kind of a miracle when you look at the
[598.38 --> 606.14]  way that it didn't happen with gpus um and to be clear there has been stuff at the show this year
[606.14 --> 613.50]  that is gamer focused i mean uh we've got a short that i shot for short circuit on asus's concept gpu
[613.50 --> 619.90]  that moves the 12 volt power off of the top so there's no cable and it's just got a finger on the
[619.90 --> 625.78]  bottom but i feel like a lot of noise was made about how innovative that was from people who don't
[625.78 --> 633.92]  cover mac because when apple launched the the latest cheese grader mac pro that's exactly how
[633.92 --> 641.12]  they did the power for the gpus in it and it supported cables so it had uh female connectors on
[641.12 --> 647.76]  the motherboard and you could buy a cable kit so you could plug like a non-first-party gpu into it you
[647.76 --> 653.74]  could power it that way but it just had a slot x extended slot at the back and you plugged it in like
[653.74 --> 657.86]  that and that was how it was powered and i'm sitting here going like i mean is that really
[657.86 --> 666.00]  is that really gaming news then uh a couple brands showed off even bigger 4090s uh sweet
[666.00 --> 672.90]  that's what we need nice all right so cooler master did and then uh this wasn't in our computex
[672.90 --> 677.62]  round up here it's not in our notes but um asus also did when i popped by they
[677.62 --> 690.68]  we have a mock-up of a noctua edition cooler that has 140 millimeter fans on it noctua's new 140
[690.68 --> 699.58]  millimeter fans so it probably performs like a hot damn but it is absolutely colossal we're gonna have
[699.58 --> 705.32]  a tweet going up with just like your classic i'm holding a regular size gpu and i'm holding that when
[705.32 --> 710.86]  you versus the guy she tells you not to worry about you know that sort of thing yeah um but really the
[710.86 --> 721.42]  big news the big innovations were in the data center were in you know mobile um intel showed
[721.42 --> 730.36]  nothing for a consumer desktop yeah amd showed nothing for consumer desktop nvidia showed nothing
[730.36 --> 738.72]  for consumer desktop when was the last time that that happened at computex yeah
[738.72 --> 746.74]  yeah that's rough and not even consumer desktop i mean we're not even seeing we're not even seeing
[746.74 --> 754.34]  uh there's hints there's hints that there's a new thread ripper coming but is it going to be a thread
[754.34 --> 760.20]  ripper for enthusiasts or is it going to be thread ripper pro which is priced for professionals and is
[760.20 --> 764.44]  not really going to be applicable to gamers at all anyway because the motherboards are going to cost
[764.44 --> 772.48]  thirteen hundred dollars like we've seen with the current thread ripper pros yeah um curious brad says
[772.48 --> 777.98]  i'm so sick of nvidia this nvidia that i want to see the competition rise up you got to give you got
[777.98 --> 784.90]  to give credit to nvidia though they they just keep kind of they keep kind of killing it i guess i'll also
[784.90 --> 791.34]  throw a shout out to intel they're trying yeah yeah they're trying on it those price cuts recently
[791.34 --> 799.84]  are actually like really compelling yeah 199 for an a750 yeah like that's actually crazy i know it only
[799.84 --> 807.20]  has eight gigs of vram guys but like it's two hundred dollars yeah like that that's freaking awesome
[807.20 --> 815.74]  it's actually wild competition's back but it seems to be between intel and amd yeah at the low end yeah
[815.74 --> 820.86]  because i mean nvidia comes in with the 4060 okay we're going to talk about nvidia in more detail later
[820.86 --> 827.70]  but um you know first i want to i want to talk about you know this this this kind of this topic
[827.70 --> 832.36]  that i wanted to discuss which is like pc gaming's kind of in trouble um
[832.36 --> 844.84]  um is it pc gaming or is it pc gaming hardware enthusiasts well i think it's a little bit of
[844.84 --> 852.78]  i think it's a little bit of both right because there's a lot of excitement for you know higher
[852.78 --> 862.30]  fidelity graphics for example and for you know game design that pushes the envelope and you know
[862.30 --> 869.96]  whether that's in-game physics or whether it's you know much larger scale multiplayer or whether it's
[869.96 --> 879.00]  like there's lots of different things that are not just more eye candy yeah faster gpu right and one of
[879.00 --> 884.28]  the observations that i made at the show is that a lot of the really exciting stuff that's happening
[884.28 --> 892.24]  right now is in the data center and more worrying that data center tech is not the
[892.24 --> 898.50]  kind of thing that i'm expecting to trickle down to gamers in a meaningful way and so i want to
[898.50 --> 904.98]  kind of explain what i mean by that in the past we saw innovation like there's always been this i
[904.98 --> 910.58]  shouldn't say always been but there has traditionally been this trickle down so when
[910.58 --> 917.92]  multi-core was a big push in the data center uh you know back especially when software was uh licensed
[917.92 --> 924.68]  per socket right all of a sudden there was this push to have more and more cores per socket right
[924.68 --> 931.04]  and then when performance per watt was a big push in the data center all of a sudden we saw
[931.04 --> 937.26]  efficiency gaming brands talking about how important efficiency was for your new gaming cpu which has
[937.26 --> 941.38]  been great because power prices and a lot of places around the world are like through the absolute roof
[941.38 --> 948.44]  right now but right now what we're talking about is accelerators uh we're talking about i mean amd
[948.44 --> 954.84]  launched that really cool looking video encoding accelerator yeah yeah yeah right when talking about
[954.84 --> 959.04]  things like ai accelerators and whatnot though i do think that's actually going to trickle down
[959.04 --> 963.40]  well because we're talking about we're talking about things like okay not in the gaming space but
[963.40 --> 968.68]  there's that talk recently about the generative ai that's in photoshop yes that's actually pretty big
[968.68 --> 974.20]  and then i do believe there's going to be games that like you know procedurally generated game styles
[974.20 --> 980.82]  where it's procedurally generated through ai accelerated tasks but tell me this will that ai
[980.82 --> 988.66]  make its way to your local processing in a meaningful way or will that generative ai be done in on a in a
[988.66 --> 994.44]  cloud server somewhere i actually genuinely streams to you both you think it will be both because i think
[994.44 --> 1001.92]  there's going to be single player games that have procedural generation built into it and they can
[1001.92 --> 1007.54]  use your local processing to do it how are the games rating organizations going to rate a game
[1007.54 --> 1014.36]  that has real time generated content in it especially with ai's ability to just like screw up
[1014.36 --> 1020.96]  yeah hallucinate just do the wrong thing because you can you can put like bumpers but it can also just
[1020.96 --> 1025.66]  go around it or find alternatives so that that's going to be interesting all right well you're getting
[1025.66 --> 1030.74]  ahead of me a little bit here but i was going to point out that some of the things that we're seeing
[1030.74 --> 1038.92]  in the data center space right now are just plain not beneficial to consumers yes pcie gen 5 this is
[1038.92 --> 1046.56]  going to be kind of an unpopular take i think but i fully support that both nvidia and amd and actually
[1046.56 --> 1054.38]  i guess intel for that matter all delivered their latest gen gpus with pcie gen 4. we clearly
[1054.38 --> 1062.40]  obviously just like don't need it do not need double the pcie bandwidth for our for our gaming gpus
[1062.40 --> 1070.18]  and then you know storage storage is another area where brands are pushing pcie gen 5 really hard
[1070.18 --> 1077.14]  but we've shown and other publications have shown time and time again that the benefit to pcie gen 5
[1077.14 --> 1084.88]  to faster storage in general for gamers is basically nothing now could that change um and then right the
[1084.88 --> 1089.84]  last point i was going to make is that it's all about accelerators now so whether it's video encoding
[1089.84 --> 1099.04]  accelerators from amd or whether it's uh ai accelerators or whether it's um you know oh like
[1099.04 --> 1104.38]  network accelerators nvidia was really excited about this this network accelerator they were showing
[1104.38 --> 1110.70]  off that has a 16 core cpu on it or something like that um yeah there were comments on the video like
[1110.70 --> 1117.58]  nvidia's new network card has more compute cores on it than my entire household you know
[1117.58 --> 1126.34]  and it's really cool technology but we look at how long gigabit was the standard for consumers
[1126.34 --> 1133.24]  and i'm sitting here going is encrypting your network is offloading network traffic encryption
[1133.24 --> 1137.10]  really going to be something we're going to see on a desktop computer in the next 10 years
[1137.10 --> 1145.34]  15 20 it's hard to look that far ahead yeah but i kind of doubt it and so i'm looking at all these
[1145.34 --> 1151.98]  innovations so pcie gen 5 even in the data center a big part of it is simplifying board layouts and
[1151.98 --> 1159.12]  making them more economical so you know taking an ssd and giving it two lanes of gen 5 instead of four
[1159.12 --> 1162.70]  lanes of gen 4 and getting that same bandwidth and i think we're going to continue to see that moving
[1162.70 --> 1171.72]  into into gen 6 and so we may not even see consumer platforms adopt gen 6 just over the over the power
[1171.72 --> 1178.58]  consumption limitations or we might see if them use gen 6 but just use fewer lanes for everything as
[1178.58 --> 1184.22]  opposed to actually making things faster now where i wanted to kind of pivot the conversation is to
[1184.22 --> 1191.30]  talk about and speculate how we could see these technologies being beneficial to consumers i mean
[1191.30 --> 1201.66]  one area where faster storage is supposed to help right is um direct storage yeah but we've seen a
[1201.66 --> 1210.48]  couple of direct storage games and it hasn't really made a difference no so what's what's the deal with
[1210.48 --> 1218.50]  that is it just that these games were not developed start to finish enough around fast storage hardware
[1218.50 --> 1223.38]  yeah i think there's also the like early adopter thing like you know when a console first comes out
[1223.38 --> 1230.98]  look at um tears of the kingdom versus the first one breath of the wild like the the there was pretty
[1230.98 --> 1234.30]  significant improvements that happened there as far as my understanding goes if you actually
[1234.30 --> 1243.22]  happen to play it on a switch instead of emulating it um but like they're gonna get better at using
[1243.22 --> 1248.62]  it over time but there also needs to be incentives for these devs to have to like work harder to
[1248.62 --> 1254.48]  actually do that there's there's conversations going around recently about how like developing for
[1254.48 --> 1261.06]  the switch is where you're seeing pretty much all of the effort going into being efficient with things
[1261.06 --> 1269.52]  you can see pc games coming out there like 140 gigs yeah it's just like oh yeah okay so they did yeah i
[1269.52 --> 1275.48]  don't know we'll see it happen but okay what else could we use faster storage for i mean that's always
[1275.48 --> 1281.60]  been something that's been kind of baffling to me you know when i'm uh you know performing some some
[1281.60 --> 1288.44]  simple operation my cpu is sitting at four percent usage my rams barely touched and my supposedly you
[1288.44 --> 1296.10]  know seven gigabyte a second ssd is pinned at a at a hundred percent and like i'm not even doing i'm not
[1296.10 --> 1301.50]  even doing that much um you know it realistically is the limitation always just going to be the
[1301.50 --> 1306.22]  controllers and the nand flash as opposed to the pipes to them but let's say let's say they can build
[1306.22 --> 1311.82]  faster flash and and we reduce that bottleneck uh you know what would we do with faster storage so
[1311.82 --> 1317.10]  direct storage theoretically would allow us to do ps5 type things where you're streaming game data
[1317.10 --> 1326.18]  directly off of the ssd um like streaming textures um i'd like to see i'd like to see an xbox like resume
[1326.18 --> 1333.32]  but not just from suspend from like hibernate is there any reason god is well no think about it
[1333.32 --> 1341.32]  no i love the concept i just windows and sleeping i know but look great concept though yeah we're no
[1341.32 --> 1346.58]  we're we're having we're we're thinking optimistically yeah yeah yeah yeah i know it's great turn off that
[1346.58 --> 1353.80]  pessimistic cynical brain of yours and think of what we could do with faster storage hit me guys
[1353.80 --> 1362.10]  i do like that a lot being able to sleep your computer in the middle of heavy tasks like gaming or
[1362.10 --> 1366.22]  potentially whatever else and come back to it and have it actually resume in the middle of it would
[1366.22 --> 1374.26]  be would be cool fire simulations guys um i mean i guess
[1374.26 --> 1383.56]  yeah there's not uh there's not uh oh this is it store things faster what a what a comment amazing
[1383.56 --> 1393.58]  oh discussion question handyman over on floatplane chat asks uh have i buried the hatchet with jensen from
[1393.58 --> 1401.18]  nvidia um i actually do have an update on that so i can i can talk about that a little bit but
[1401.18 --> 1408.56]  i'm worried i think you're right i think ai ai games are are going to be
[1408.56 --> 1416.16]  they're going to have a moment and then they're going to go away because they kind of sucked oh
[1416.16 --> 1421.08]  yeah they're all going to be really bad and then we're going to find ways to implement it into
[1421.08 --> 1426.46]  handcrafted games and it's going to end up being i suspect the early ones it's going to be like a
[1426.46 --> 1432.86]  selling feature of the game yes it's going to be like cgi and movies yeah right where it starts out
[1432.86 --> 1440.84]  as doing cgi for the sake of doing cgi yeah and then it turns into you know wolf of wall street
[1440.84 --> 1448.10]  have you ever seen the side by side of wolf of wall street shots before and after cgi watching the
[1448.10 --> 1454.72]  movie you wouldn't even know yeah i wouldn't have thought there was any cgi heavy this film is wow but
[1454.72 --> 1460.12]  there's like this there's this helicopter shot of his beach house and other than the house itself
[1460.12 --> 1465.22]  like the surrounding area looks nothing like the original shot they just and there's this doorway
[1465.22 --> 1471.28]  that he walks through and it's on a basically completely different building um and i'm just
[1471.28 --> 1477.42]  looking at it going was that necessary really necessary but but it was integrated in such a way
[1477.42 --> 1482.66]  that i didn't notice it i wouldn't have noticed at all and so if that was the director's vision then
[1482.66 --> 1489.40]  great yeah like i suspect there's going to be some ai procedurally generated dungeon crawler which
[1489.40 --> 1496.24]  exists purely because it is what i just said well what's funny it's funny that you say that because
[1496.24 --> 1504.90]  the procedurally generated levels were a major selling point of diablo one yeah um and so we might
[1504.90 --> 1512.72]  see better that but it's going to be worse in certain ways oh yeah almost certainly it will be
[1512.72 --> 1517.70]  worse in certain ways it's like going to generate something that like the the word for it is similar to
[1517.70 --> 1521.30]  something else so it ends up spitting out the wrong thing and all these other problems are going to
[1521.30 --> 1525.58]  happen but yeah i think we're going to go too far at first and then it'll fall back and then when it
[1525.58 --> 1532.08]  starts to come back and properly i think it'll be in ways that you don't necessarily notice a ton
[1532.08 --> 1538.90]  but yeah so honestly with that timeline i think we're like pretty significantly far out
[1538.90 --> 1546.60]  um and i guess that transitions us pretty perfectly to talking a little bit more in detail about
[1546.60 --> 1553.50]  nvidia and what's been going on with them lately uh nvidia joined the one trillion dollar valuation
[1553.50 --> 1561.48]  big boys club sorry gamers uh and i alluded to this earlier right on the heels of their launch of the
[1561.48 --> 1572.52]  the rtx 4060 where gamers were up in arms uh gaming media is up in arms over how uh you know awful the 4060
[1572.52 --> 1581.30]  is from a competitive standpoint how awful it is from a uh last gen to current gen upgrade standpoint
[1581.30 --> 1588.38]  and then their stock jumps you know 25 the following day they briefly hit a one trillion dollar valuation
[1588.38 --> 1597.88]  um this is alongside apple alphabet microsoft amazon and saudi aramco which i don't know how to pronounce
[1597.88 --> 1604.82]  but there you go oil company um they're the first chip maker to touch the one trillion mark thanks to
[1604.82 --> 1611.22]  massive demand for ai processors that is what it is all about i think you nailed it i think it was last
[1611.22 --> 1615.84]  when show when you were saying like i think they're not being price competitive on this gpu because they just
[1615.84 --> 1621.56]  didn't dedicate a lot of like manufacturing to it like i think that's it i think why be price competitive
[1621.56 --> 1626.42]  when we don't even like we don't even have a ton of them because we want those lines to be dedicated
[1626.42 --> 1634.72]  towards other things here's the thing i i don't i don't know if i was right anymore i think it's a
[1634.72 --> 1639.82]  combination of things um they they went to an aggressive new process node that is more expensive and
[1639.82 --> 1646.02]  does have lower yields compared to what amd is able to do with their lower end cards uh 7600 was
[1646.02 --> 1652.48]  the most recent one and i had a meeting with nvidia at the show that i i guess i should talk about right
[1652.48 --> 1658.86]  i don't know if any of it was on the record so hopefully this is all kosher but uh anywho
[1658.86 --> 1668.96]  basically the here's what i think and this is not anything that anyone at nvidia said this is just
[1668.96 --> 1676.90]  what i think from talking to some of the nvidia folks from seeing what's going on with them on a
[1676.90 --> 1682.78]  business level i think they should split up i think they should spin off g-force
[1682.78 --> 1690.66]  interesting because talking to the folks at nvidia who do work on the g-force team looking at the
[1690.66 --> 1698.84]  kinds of unnecessary innovations that they are still bringing to gaming uh so they announced uh a new
[1698.84 --> 1704.58]  ultra low motion blur technology that they've announced a few things yeah yeah that they they
[1704.58 --> 1710.70]  claim gets to something i think there's like 1600 hertz motion clarity or something like that it feels
[1710.70 --> 1712.78]  it feels it feels very
[1712.78 --> 1722.44]  because we can make it a little bit better you know and and that's especially true to me because
[1722.44 --> 1729.42]  we have display technologies coming down the pipe that are going to make that level of better image
[1729.42 --> 1739.10]  persistence on lcd totally unnecessary right and so i'm looking at it going yeah these guys in the lab
[1739.10 --> 1747.72]  are are are are really trying to crush it here for gamers and in some ways i feel like they're kind of
[1747.72 --> 1756.10]  getting held back by the expectations that nvidia the organization's shareholders have for profitability
[1756.10 --> 1766.76]  because g-force is always going to be a consumer brand with consumer margins right whereas nvidia's data center
[1766.76 --> 1777.46]  business or their ai business for for automotive right or their um you know embedded products
[1777.46 --> 1783.74]  business like all of these anything that's b2b is inherently going to have more margin because your
[1783.74 --> 1791.18]  customer is making money on it like a new gpu is a burden because all of a sudden there's all these new
[1791.18 --> 1796.22]  games that you couldn't play before that now it's time to buy and play and i don't mean a burden
[1796.22 --> 1804.38]  personally i mean a financial burden right you're not outside of mining you're not making money on it
[1804.38 --> 1811.98]  but but that's a really important point to make because mining is such a great example of how when
[1811.98 --> 1818.78]  something makes you money all of a sudden even if you are an actual gamer you're willing to pay so much
[1818.78 --> 1826.14]  more for it because it helps offset the cost yeah yeah right so the kinds of margins that nvidia can
[1826.14 --> 1831.74]  make on something like a gray super chip are going to look really attractive to their shareholders and
[1831.74 --> 1839.90]  the kinds of margins they can make on some rtx 4060 even if it seems completely unreasonable to you and to me
[1840.62 --> 1847.82]  are going to look really unattractive and as the proportion of this business shrinks on the gaming
[1847.82 --> 1853.66]  side and grows on the data center side their shareholders are going to look at them and go
[1853.66 --> 1863.10]  hey guys um what are you doing yeah are you should you even be making consumer gpus anymore or shipping
[1863.10 --> 1869.26]  all the silicon all the wafers you can get from tsmc or intel for that matter that's going to be
[1869.26 --> 1875.34]  interesting jensen said their next gen manufacturing node is looking good should you just be booking all of
[1875.34 --> 1882.06]  it for ai and completely ignoring gaming and i don't think nvidia wants to that's what i wanted to
[1882.06 --> 1888.70]  say is i think the geforce team really wants to build great gaming experiences and i feel like they're
[1888.70 --> 1894.94]  a little bit hamstrung right now i i have for quite a while now i i assume you've kind of felt the same
[1894.94 --> 1901.34]  thing you know when you used to go to nvidia.com and the like main thing was drivers geforce drivers
[1901.34 --> 1907.50]  yeah specifically yeah now like even if you go to geforce.com which just redirects to nvidia.com
[1907.50 --> 1913.98]  slash geforce um there's there's like the geforce section but then there's another banner above that
[1913.98 --> 1918.86]  just like making sure that you don't forget that there's a separation between geforce and nvidia
[1918.86 --> 1925.10]  and you can go to the main menu of that idea.com which has nothing to do with geforce even when you're
[1925.10 --> 1929.74]  on the specific geforce page they're like just in case you didn't mean to be here we've got you
[1929.74 --> 1935.34]  product solutions industries for you whatever that means yeah like it's i have always felt kind
[1935.34 --> 1940.94]  of weird about the nvidia site for a while now because of that reason and this really ties into
[1940.94 --> 1947.26]  what i was talking about before where it used to be that the innovations that nvidia would build
[1947.26 --> 1953.74]  for their data center products would benefit gamers would make their way down to gamers yeah but
[1953.74 --> 1961.90]  we've actually seen over actually wow i guess the last couple of generations uh volta was an was
[1961.90 --> 1971.58]  uh an example of an nvidia chip that was built specifically not for gamers um and then hopper i i
[1971.58 --> 1978.78]  as far as i can tell is simply not for gamers at all it just it just doesn't have it just doesn't
[1978.78 --> 1986.78]  have functional units you need for gaming because it's laser focused on ai right um and so we're not
[1986.78 --> 1993.90]  gonna we're not gonna necessarily benefit from that that r d money that comes from enterprise customers
[1994.46 --> 2000.94]  and goes towards building a bigger better gpu that ultimately gamers also get to kind of tag along with
[2000.94 --> 2010.54]  right and so i yeah i i i would i don't know if i would like to see it but i think it makes sense
[2010.54 --> 2017.74]  i think it could make sense for nvidia to just say yeah this is a spin-off business it's g-force they
[2017.74 --> 2024.62]  they sort of they they they buy innovation from nvidia essentially they're they're a customer of nvidia
[2024.62 --> 2031.98]  nvidia uh in the same way that uh a nintendo would be a customer of nvidia for the processor and the
[2031.98 --> 2040.06]  switch and the g-force team is laser focused on building you know great drivers uh building great
[2040.06 --> 2044.62]  technologies to leverage the hardware from nvidia obviously they'd work very close together but then
[2044.62 --> 2050.54]  they wouldn't have the burden of needing to make those same margins and they could get scrappier
[2050.54 --> 2058.46]  and they could they could take the fight to amd and as intel ramps up with battle mage and celestial
[2058.46 --> 2063.26]  their upcoming architectures um i think they could be more competitive because at the end of the day
[2063.82 --> 2076.46]  right every fanboy has gotta understand you don't want one to win yeah yeah ever that's not good
[2076.46 --> 2087.10]  whether we're talking the big three intel amd nvidia every single one of them has shown again and again
[2087.74 --> 2097.58]  and again that in the absence of compa of compa i'm very tired in the absence of competition stagnation
[2097.58 --> 2105.42]  the first thing they'll do is stop refreshing products and ramp up the price yeah let's look for a
[2105.42 --> 2111.50]  recent examples from each one shall we play a game sure do you want to go first or shall i go first
[2114.14 --> 2121.90]  intel pre-amds resurgence in the like what would that have been like five six thousand series well
[2121.90 --> 2132.38]  this number this number is key four four okay how many cores did you get oh yeah okay yeah four four
[2132.38 --> 2138.78]  cores forever was was that was a very long term that ought to be all anyone needs yeah that's good
[2138.78 --> 2147.10]  enough yeah that's a perfect example and then if we look to amd the second intel didn't have an hedt
[2147.10 --> 2154.86]  a high-end desktop competitor amd simply stopped bothering releasing new thread rippers regardless of
[2154.86 --> 2161.66]  the commitments that they had already made not just to their enthusiast and gamer customers but to
[2162.38 --> 2172.38]  buyers of the strx 40 or whatever it was called their their last socket their ryzen 3000 thread ripper
[2172.38 --> 2181.74]  socket they were just like okay it was basically done there were samples out there they just decided
[2181.74 --> 2188.22]  yeah why bother thread ripper pro is more profitable and this is why why bother this is why for years as
[2188.22 --> 2192.94]  we've been rooting for amd to push really hard we've also been pointing out that they're not like
[2194.22 --> 2199.82]  you know they're like magically benevolent good guys there was that campaign that they ran a while ago
[2199.82 --> 2207.50]  where they had people with like uh protest signs at pax and stuff do you remember that no oh man i don't
[2207.50 --> 2213.02]  think i saw that it sounds cringe i don't remember the name of the campaign sounds cringe
[2215.02 --> 2222.46]  uh it was like resist like resist amds or resist intels whatever i wonder if i can find it
[2226.38 --> 2230.94]  i think it's probably been like too long and looking up anything that has to do with protest is just going
[2230.94 --> 2235.98]  to come up with a lot of news articles so i think i don't think i'm going to find it but yeah at like
[2235.98 --> 2243.26]  pax west back in the day i remember there being like genuine paid actors with protest signs that
[2243.26 --> 2247.98]  had like like resist blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and it was all amd branding and it was all about
[2247.98 --> 2256.70]  like buy amd to resist intel it's like uh yeah you guys would do the same thing yep i do want you to
[2256.70 --> 2262.38]  do better because competition is good but yeah okay so then the last one is nvidia
[2264.54 --> 2272.06]  nvidia i honestly feel like hasn't sat on their laurels as much in a technological sense as the other
[2272.06 --> 2279.74]  brands but they have definitely taken advantage of what they can extract cost wise yeah much as possible
[2279.74 --> 2286.62]  yep i mean with them in some ways they're just kind of smarter about it because they're definitely
[2286.62 --> 2293.74]  doing it and we talked about this when we did our tier list for the best geforce gpus which by the
[2293.74 --> 2298.78]  way i know i often ask you have you watched the video i know the answer is no you should watch this
[2298.78 --> 2303.26]  one i skipped through and watched the 8 000 series because i like cared about that you know how many
[2303.26 --> 2312.14]  people did that was it a lot the uh well not the 8 000 series specifically but the the retention chart on
[2312.14 --> 2320.70]  that video is super weird we actually had a debate internally before we started working on it for
[2320.70 --> 2328.86]  when we should start because we didn't start at the beginning and we could have because the there were
[2328.86 --> 2337.02]  only a few generations of geforce gpus before the starting point and we didn't start later so it was
[2337.02 --> 2346.78]  actually pitched to me that we started more um like like way way more recently i forget i forget what
[2346.78 --> 2354.94]  the what the push was but way more recently and and do do far fewer of them and i picked fx
[2355.90 --> 2363.42]  and i forget why i think the rationale that i provided was it was right it was the first direct x9 gpu and
[2363.42 --> 2372.14]  i think this is just my own personal biases because for me pc gaming really started to get you know
[2372.94 --> 2380.94]  visually really good looking with direct x9 and looking back at it i think it was just my own personal
[2382.22 --> 2389.10]  that's when i got into gaming and so we see that in the retention graph for this video how many people
[2389.10 --> 2397.98]  got into gaming with 900 series and 10 series yeah basically everything earlier is like skip skip skip
[2397.98 --> 2403.66]  skip oh what about this one that i bought that i'm really passionate about or that's still in my gaming
[2403.66 --> 2410.78]  rig right now and i love this thing i've been using it for years isn't that hilarious just how few people
[2411.58 --> 2418.54]  cared wild these spikes are so wow yeah really extreme i've never seen anything quite like this
[2418.54 --> 2424.86]  that's very interesting yeah it's really cool uh anywho what was i talking about again right so
[2424.86 --> 2430.14]  with nvidia it's been more of a slow boil and we talked about it a fair bit here where starting with
[2430.14 --> 2436.46]  the 600 series this history is really important to understand when you look at nvidia's pricing
[2436.46 --> 2442.62]  strategy and you want to kind of get a better idea of where they're going in the future so starting
[2442.62 --> 2450.62]  with 600 series and okay nvidia has code names for their gpus and i hate that the word gpu has come to
[2450.62 --> 2460.14]  mean graphics card because they are not the same thing a gpu is a graphics processing unit and it's a chip
[2460.94 --> 2472.54]  a graphics card is a board that contains a gpu vram power delivery display outputs okay so the gpu
[2472.62 --> 2479.58]  of the gpu's they have code names for these and typically they will have the uh a letter to indicate
[2479.58 --> 2488.62]  the architecture like gk would be g force kepler or ga would be g force ampere okay so they have a letter
[2488.62 --> 2496.94]  and then they have a number and that number the final digit the lower that digit is so if it's a zero
[2496.94 --> 2504.70]  that is going to be the largest chip for that series if it's a two that's going to be a smaller
[2504.70 --> 2511.26]  one if it's a four smaller six smaller i'm trying to remember how high they've gone in the past but
[2511.26 --> 2519.10]  the point is the higher that number goes the smaller the actual die is so sometimes you'll see two
[2519.10 --> 2525.42]  geforce gpus that have let's say one has 5000 CUDA cores and one has 4000 but if you dig into you know
[2525.42 --> 2530.38]  the tech power up gpu database or something like that you'll find that they're both using the same
[2530.38 --> 2534.54]  chip well some of those functional units might have been some of those CUDA cores might have been
[2535.10 --> 2541.74]  damaged in manufacturing or they might have just been turned off to hit a lower power profile or to
[2542.38 --> 2547.90]  to to create segmentation between two products so that you know this one doesn't perform too close to
[2547.90 --> 2554.38]  the other one but other times you'll see that two products are using completely different dies because
[2554.38 --> 2562.62]  there's only so many CUDA cores on a die even if it's perfect and it only makes so much sense to cut
[2562.62 --> 2568.62]  them down before that's just a a broken product and the power profile wouldn't make any sense for this
[2568.62 --> 2572.54]  you know more budget oriented product so that's why you design these different sizes of dies
[2574.54 --> 2582.94]  finally getting there um with kepler that was the first time we saw nvidia launch a flagship 80 series
[2582.94 --> 2593.42]  gtx you know product a top tier product with not the top tier die now we had seen before a top tier die
[2594.14 --> 2603.42]  but with no it wasn't the first time okay i'll talk a little bit about that other one later um we had seen
[2603.42 --> 2610.70]  not a top tier die uh or we had seen a top tier die but not all of it so a slightly cut down one and that
[2610.70 --> 2615.26]  would that would be due to yields right they just couldn't get enough fully working ones to make it
[2615.26 --> 2621.42]  economically viable but we hadn't seen them launch a flagship gpu with uh with with a cut down with a
[2621.42 --> 2626.94]  not top tier die and then we didn't get big kepler until 700 series so we got kepler and then we got
[2626.94 --> 2632.22]  kepler again something we again i don't think had actually seen in the past but that's with an asterisk
[2632.22 --> 2638.86]  because the 9000 yeah the 9000 series was a little bit more complicated where 8000 series was awesome
[2638.86 --> 2650.14]  g80 so that's eight zero that was a big die was the 8800 gtx and the 8800 ultra was uh kind of usurped
[2650.14 --> 2658.46]  by g92 which was uh a shrunk and just like way more efficient even though it was smaller um die so the
[2658.46 --> 2664.46]  8800 gt came out and kind of made the gtx look pointless from a cost perspective and then they
[2664.46 --> 2671.98]  tweaked that and released the 9800 gtx which was not a big die but there wasn't a big die version it was
[2671.98 --> 2678.54]  just uh it was just a really weird time for for nvidia because they couldn't innovate as easily as
[2678.54 --> 2683.34]  they had been able to before that because they couldn't just keep shrinking the manufacturing process
[2683.34 --> 2688.38]  that was kind of where we started to ask the question is moore's law dead uh you know is gpu
[2688.38 --> 2694.46]  innovation going to slow down in a big way and it has and that's the same thing where i'm talking
[2694.46 --> 2699.42]  about them boiling the frog in terms of slowing things down there were definitely times when they
[2699.42 --> 2705.66]  could have probably pushed harder but started stretching you know how long a gpu generation
[2705.66 --> 2713.58]  should stick around for from you know i mean they were they were launching new stuff like eight
[2713.58 --> 2718.86]  10 months after previous generations sub one year windows for a bit there and then it went to a
[2718.86 --> 2723.74]  yearly cadence and then it went to i mean 18 months is fine right two years two years seems okay
[2725.02 --> 2731.90]  by the way i found it it was called the amd uprising campaign the whole thing was about you like joining the
[2731.90 --> 2739.34]  rebellion and hashtag better red and stuff so it was it was a weird campaign i did not like it but
[2739.34 --> 2749.74]  it is what it is not the first odd marketing we've seen and not the last moving on next topic oh should
[2749.74 --> 2755.10]  we do three merch messages we never did breakfast there was one of these for you oh um yeah let's do
[2755.10 --> 2763.74]  a few merch messages dan are you can you hear us oh yeah of course oh it's daniel besser hi oh wait i'm
[2763.74 --> 2768.30]  supposed to explain merch messages that's right merch messages they're these things they're how you
[2768.30 --> 2773.26]  interact with the show we launched a new product on the store hey dan do you have the capability of
[2773.26 --> 2782.30]  showing people the new product technically so yes uh oh can we use aj for this oh this is going to be
[2782.30 --> 2788.30]  embarrassing i mean i guess we could show it on the website yeah this might take a minute though
[2788.30 --> 2797.10]  um what i have a couple on the table we could just show them with a camera uh that it you know what
[2797.90 --> 2801.82]  i'm gonna propose something even jankier oh i love it
[2806.06 --> 2813.58]  it's the fleece lined jacket it's a sweater it's a jacket it's launching in june because we just love
[2813.58 --> 2819.42]  our australian community so much actually it's because we only launch things when they're ready
[2819.42 --> 2824.14]  and this is when it happens to be ready wait no it's it's a shirt or a jacket shirt meets jacket
[2824.14 --> 2833.10]  excuse me yeah um i could show it with the producer cam it's it's it's it's pretty cool it's very warm
[2833.10 --> 2839.10]  but it still looks you know just kind of kind of like a shirt um you know it's nice for going out i
[2839.10 --> 2845.34]  would i would say on a fall day going for a walk in the park you're not going to reach for anything
[2845.34 --> 2854.22]  else once you have one of these um it looks sharp yeah yeah looks looks really sharp we tried to make
[2854.22 --> 2861.26]  this reversible fun story it did not work oh yeah yeah we thought it would be really cool if this kind
[2861.26 --> 2870.46]  of like camo uh camo stripey inner material was actually wearable on the outside and it was not
[2871.90 --> 2878.86]  yeah we we do have a reversible garment coming soon but it is it is not this day uh anywho if you want
[2878.86 --> 2886.06]  to pick up one of these or anything else you know water bottle screwdriver um stick locks have been really
[2886.06 --> 2896.38]  popular as well then head over to ltdstore.com and in the checkout right in the cart dang it in the cart
[2896.38 --> 2902.06]  a box will appear giving you the option to write a merch message you can send a shout out for one of
[2902.06 --> 2906.62]  your friends or your mom who happens to watch the wan show because she's luke's mom uh you can
[2909.10 --> 2915.26]  uh you can ask our producer a question uh you can also post a question in hopes that dan will
[2915.26 --> 2920.78]  choose your question to be addressed later on when show after dark which there may not be any after
[2920.78 --> 2927.74]  dark because it is the morning where we are yeah that's very unusual um anyway the point is don't do
[2927.74 --> 2932.30]  super chats you know don't do twitch bits or whatever else do merch messages because then
[2932.94 --> 2939.26]  even in the event that we don't get to your message you get your order in the mail and it's going
[2939.26 --> 2948.06]  to be quality that we do not talk nearly enough about how well reviewed our products are like just
[2948.06 --> 2954.46]  about every product on ltdstore four and a half stars and up and we don't we don't curate this stuff
[2954.46 --> 2960.06]  we believe in transparency like you go on the it's also a lot of reviews you go on the screwdriver page
[2960.06 --> 2969.98]  there's yeah it's it's it really is like very funny to me when haters talk about what a failure the
[2969.98 --> 2976.14]  you know backpacker screwdriver were or whatever did you see 6900 reviews on screwdriver yeah nice and
[2976.14 --> 2982.78]  you know backpack no one would be stupid enough to buy this backpack it has almost 2500 reviews
[2983.82 --> 2987.98]  they didn't they didn't come from nowhere they weren't they're they're not generative ai
[2988.70 --> 2992.94]  reviews guys these are these are real reviews from real people that are thrilled with it because
[2992.94 --> 2999.42]  it's a freaking awesome backpack um all right dan want to hit us with some merch messages yeah sure
[2999.42 --> 3006.86]  thing um let's see first one here hey o lld would you ever want to fly to space how for how long and
[3006.86 --> 3011.34]  where would you like to go uh the international space station the moon maybe mars
[3011.34 --> 3023.50]  what what was the question do you want to go to space yeah definitely is it wondering where in
[3023.50 --> 3029.10]  space you want to go okay would you ever want to fly to space yes for sure how long i don't know ever
[3029.10 --> 3036.22]  uh where would you like to go all of them forever yeah why not come on you're not gonna go to space
[3036.22 --> 3047.98]  forever i'd be down no would you vacation to earth i'd be sad give a better answer um
[3049.58 --> 3054.70]  i don't know i would i would love to do a one year stint obviously this is never gonna happen
[3054.70 --> 3059.58]  a year yeah because then you get the you get a special thing i don't know what it's called
[3060.94 --> 3067.26]  maybe sweet destroyed bone density you actually it's an achievement you get a one-year achievement
[3068.62 --> 3075.10]  it's basically that i know some special badge or something i never thought about it that way but oh my
[3075.10 --> 3082.54]  oh my there we go my laugh is very obnoxious um it's called muscle atrophy there's ways to stave
[3082.54 --> 3088.86]  that off the scarier thing is your bones um but you address both in the same way you do it by working
[3088.86 --> 3097.98]  out um it's not gonna happen a year well yeah but answer the question proper okay where would you go you
[3097.98 --> 3105.74]  just would want to orbit or what i think whatever gets you the most patches yeah probably uh i think
[3105.74 --> 3110.78]  i think if i mean okay if we want to think about that way if you could be the first i think if you
[3110.78 --> 3117.58]  could be the first to step foot on mars that'd be sick that'd be sweet but if we're assuming that
[3117.58 --> 3124.22]  isn't so much of a thing yeah i don't think i'd want to do the whole mars thing it's really far i think
[3124.22 --> 3129.50]  i'd be far more likely to go to a moon base and then come back because it's been more time yeah
[3129.50 --> 3135.42]  it is actually like wild how much closer it is yeah it's kind of wild how much closer the iss is
[3135.42 --> 3139.50]  compared to the moon i think a lot of people don't consider that as well yeah it's actually a lot
[3139.50 --> 3145.42]  further not that close yeah it's like genuinely not but yeah i think some i think like an actual lunar
[3145.42 --> 3151.10]  base would be pretty sweet because yeah honestly i don't see the difference between the iss and a
[3151.10 --> 3159.34]  lunar base being all that much in terms of cost or in terms of no like the experience really sorry
[3159.34 --> 3164.14]  i'm sorry i don't you're high no no no wait wait wait i don't see that i don't see that wait wait wait
[3166.94 --> 3173.58]  you're higher than that building i don't see the benefits of being on the iss or another orbiting
[3173.58 --> 3180.14]  station being much higher than being on a station that is on the surface and then i see probably being
[3180.14 --> 3186.14]  able to exit the station and go wander around the moon being much more likely than spacewalks because
[3186.14 --> 3191.34]  spacewalks are like super super coveted right and even a bunch of astronauts that don't go up are never
[3191.34 --> 3197.82]  allowed to do spacewalks yeah so like i think it's much more likely if you're actually on i i would i would
[3197.82 --> 3206.62]  100 want to just like i mean not golf because you'd never find the ball but like i would i would want a
[3206.62 --> 3212.06]  sports ball on the moon putting a little tracker in a golf ball and just whacking it would actually
[3212.06 --> 3218.30]  be pretty cool you'd never like i'd want to get it back though like i'd want to see it go and you
[3218.30 --> 3223.66]  would like it would just i assume anyway i don't know i've never been to it would depend how hard you
[3223.66 --> 3229.34]  hit it because i mean the moon has grad like it's gonna theoretically unless you can get like escape
[3229.34 --> 3234.14]  velocity from the moon yeah no i'd want to like no i just i just would it go around the horizon
[3234.14 --> 3238.70]  potentially like i don't know i mean you wouldn't be able to see it anymore yeah i definitely almost
[3238.70 --> 3244.14]  certainly that's that's the bigger concern i think uh but like no i'd want to throw like a football
[3244.14 --> 3249.42]  the isis has no gravity that can affect experiments yeah but like i'm a big dummy i don't think i'm
[3249.42 --> 3254.38]  doing experiments yeah no i mean yeah no i i would just i would want to love to help i would want to
[3254.38 --> 3261.82]  play sports ball like i would just i'd want to see how fast i could whip a baseball in like almost no
[3261.82 --> 3267.02]  atmosphere because there's also no no wind resistance essentially compared to earth anyway
[3267.02 --> 3271.66]  jake mentioned playing badminton on the moon yeah exactly right that'd be pretty sick yeah actually
[3271.66 --> 3278.38]  very fun or not fun yeah i mean not fun at all because it would be really slow no it would be fast
[3280.38 --> 3283.82]  what slows down the the shuttle is air resistance
[3283.82 --> 3295.90]  like it okay so there's only so low there's only certain shots where it falls down yeah if you were
[3295.90 --> 3299.34]  the smashes would be terrible yeah if you hit a smash no one would be able to stop it
[3301.82 --> 3309.02]  that's pretty great that'd be freaking fun anyway okay hit me again dad sure thing hello luke and linus
[3309.02 --> 3313.66]  how do you think ai will affect gaming in the near future do you think it will be uh do you think
[3313.66 --> 3318.86]  it will make them lazy and slap it everywhere instead of polishing the games or will it be more
[3318.86 --> 3326.14]  conservatively used i think i curated this for a specific reason and it was the word lazy
[3328.46 --> 3338.06]  because ai is not lazy what it is is a tool and i think that
[3338.78 --> 3345.34]  we're going to see very lazy implementations of ai and luke and i talked about this actually a little
[3345.34 --> 3353.66]  bit earlier on the show where yeah i think developers are going to look at this ai buzz and go okay
[3354.46 --> 3359.74]  how can we cram ai into our game now so that we can put it on the box and hopefully sell a few more
[3359.74 --> 3365.58]  units to nerds who want to try out ai conversations with their waifus or whatever i think that's going to
[3365.58 --> 3372.46]  be a genre that's going to lean heavily into ai be an innovator in the space better for worse yep um
[3374.54 --> 3382.94]  but in much the same way that you know we could look at man what would it what would be a what would
[3382.94 --> 3390.30]  be a comparable comparable feature okay now i can't come up with anything right now because my brain is
[3390.30 --> 3398.70]  a little bit more about it but ai is a tool so the fact that someone uses a hammer that doesn't make
[3398.70 --> 3403.58]  them lazy like the fact that they use a hammer instead of putting the nails in by pushing them
[3403.58 --> 3411.82]  with their thumbs that's not laziness so as long as they're still working hard there's nothing inherently
[3411.82 --> 3419.74]  lazy about using a better tool now their ai has some ethical yeah questions around it that need to
[3419.74 --> 3426.30]  be answered and and some genuine like something that could be interpreted as lazy because i mean
[3426.30 --> 3429.50]  you've talked about this too right if you were going to play a single-player game you wouldn't want
[3429.50 --> 3435.26]  all the dialogue to be written by ai yeah because you'd want it to be more focused and like efficient
[3435.26 --> 3442.38]  almost not 100 but like every word should have a reason for being there those types of things um so
[3442.38 --> 3446.38]  i don't know i think you're going to see a huge range of this which shouldn't be too surprising if
[3446.38 --> 3451.66]  you've experienced much of the gaming industry i'm sure we'll see some like battlefield game or
[3451.66 --> 3456.62]  something that has absolutely atrocious dialogue because it's all just ai generated or something and
[3456.62 --> 3462.06]  we are going to see maybe not laziness this is the other reason i really didn't like this word because
[3462.06 --> 3470.94]  lazy seems to apply it to the actual devs themselves whereas i think it's more likely to be a cost
[3470.94 --> 3481.90]  cutting measure yeah from management yeah right so uh what was uh shoot i've i've forgotten i've
[3481.90 --> 3487.58]  forgotten but there was some game where the box art was apparently almost certainly procedurally
[3487.58 --> 3492.78]  generated oh uh did you did you see this i hear about there's also been games where their box art
[3492.78 --> 3498.30]  was just stolen from people but yeah i'm yeah in this case that it looked like it was procedurally
[3498.30 --> 3503.90]  generated because like the guy had like six fingers and there were little details and some artists kind
[3503.90 --> 3510.78]  of broke down you know what's what's going on here and what makes it obvious duke nukem the duke
[3510.78 --> 3514.94]  nukem remaster yeah yeah pull it up pull it up have a look sorry guys we don't have a good way of
[3514.94 --> 3521.50]  screen sharing right now so please uh you know pull this up for yourself yeah here we go duke nukem
[3521.50 --> 3531.26]  remastered ai box art is what luke typed in and apparently the the artist who was involved has you
[3531.26 --> 3541.02]  know used generative ai for artwork in the past as well so in this case was it laziness was it an extremely
[3541.02 --> 3546.86]  tight budget you know did they give the go-ahead to use ai i haven't looked into this any further yet
[3547.58 --> 3556.14]  so take this for the you know ignorant speculation that it is but i don't think it's fair to assume
[3556.14 --> 3562.78]  that it's just laziness but i also don't think it's impossible yeah this is pretty jank i see why
[3562.78 --> 3572.62]  people were kind of annoyed about this yeah yeah that's just like a hand like floating under the
[3572.62 --> 3579.66]  firearm but it's not even like in anything this that's like not that's not a barrel it just actually
[3579.66 --> 3586.70]  isn't i don't know that's weird ah yeah anyways next up
[3586.70 --> 3596.86]  can do and i guess this will be our last one for this section hi lld i'm 16 and do more robotics
[3596.86 --> 3602.62]  techie videos on youtube in the early days of ltt how did you stay motivated and how long in the
[3602.62 --> 3605.66]  future would you say youtube would still be a feasible career
[3605.66 --> 3615.74]  um needing to eat is a pretty good motivator i think we're also all pretty determined to like
[3615.74 --> 3622.46]  make this thing work yeah i was i mean i've talked about this in the past before but one of the major
[3622.46 --> 3629.98]  motivators for me was just that i was tired of working with people that i didn't um i didn't enjoy
[3629.98 --> 3637.10]  working with whether it was reporting to people who i didn't think deserved their positions who i
[3637.10 --> 3643.66]  didn't think were very smart or whether it was having to collaborate with people who were obvious
[3643.66 --> 3650.62]  nepotism hires and had no valuable skills to bring to the table whatsoever you know i wanted a company
[3650.62 --> 3658.38]  that was not built like that and the only way to get that is to start my own and the only way to get
[3658.38 --> 3664.22]  it and be sure it won't go away is to start my own fair enough yeah and so i just really needed this
[3664.22 --> 3670.22]  thing to work um you know ivan and i also just generally bet really heavily on it and so you
[3670.22 --> 3677.10]  know especially once we acquired the langley house i mean it's it's funny to look back at it now but we
[3677.10 --> 3683.90]  thought we were buying at the peak at like yeah the the highest conceivable you know housing pricing
[3684.86 --> 3690.22]  ends up we got a stellar deal or whatever but we didn't know that at the time so we thought we were
[3690.22 --> 3697.18]  basically putting everything we had into this company um and we and we just really needed it to
[3697.18 --> 3702.30]  succeed and then there were multiple phases where we kind of did the same thing again when we bought
[3702.30 --> 3708.22]  the office we thought the same thing that we were buying at the peak and it couldn't possibly go any
[3708.22 --> 3713.50]  higher so we we thought we were completely betting the farm and we needed this to succeed or like
[3713.50 --> 3719.66]  going back to our jobs there was no possible way we were paying this office mortgage that wasn't
[3719.66 --> 3728.70]  happening right so yeah eating major motivating factor um as for how long in the future did i think
[3728.70 --> 3735.74]  youtube would still be a feasible career i'll tell you this we started linustechtips.com the forum
[3735.74 --> 3741.58]  before we actually launched linus media group the company and linustechtips.com
[3743.10 --> 3749.58]  maybe not main reason but at least half of its main reason for existing is in case youtube just
[3750.22 --> 3753.82]  decides you know what forget about this channel anymore i mean we didn't have a contact at youtube
[3753.82 --> 3760.70]  at that time we didn't we didn't know that they would continue to take the creator community seriously
[3760.70 --> 3768.06]  we didn't know if they would just you know cut your adsense payment or or maybe you get three
[3768.06 --> 3773.18]  strikes out of nowhere or take it or take it away entirely like we didn't know what the plan was for
[3773.18 --> 3780.70]  the platform right we're just guessing um so at the time no i i would i would i would take every deal i
[3780.70 --> 3787.18]  would make every video thinking this could be the last one and i don't think that really changed until
[3787.18 --> 3793.66]  three four five years in really i mean even now it still feels
[3795.98 --> 3799.98]  sketchy because of like just dealing with algorithmic throws all the time
[3801.10 --> 3809.10]  i don't know it's it's a very unsettling industry to work in it just is yeah that's a good point
[3809.10 --> 3813.90]  luke was telling me he had some meetings with some creators that um
[3816.38 --> 3824.86]  were i don't know if bewildered is the right word but just um taken aback when he talked about how
[3824.86 --> 3833.58]  stressed we get about algorithmic changes or about um you know whether just the fear we have for our
[3833.58 --> 3840.22]  survival and they're like well i thought you're past that point now it's like i don't think everybody
[3840.22 --> 3850.70]  anybody ever gets past that point that's the thing about um like exponential decay right is no matter
[3850.70 --> 3858.14]  how high you start everyone ends up at zero there's a near infinite graveyard of extremely massive
[3858.14 --> 3864.46]  talented successful very talented creators and channels and all that kind of stuff that were
[3865.42 --> 3872.38]  household names on youtube that are effectively just gone that are in a lot of cases still making content
[3875.02 --> 3878.94]  we won't see them in your recommendation feels like it can really happen to anyone
[3879.82 --> 3887.58]  really and i've seen channels with with millions of subscribers that get hundreds of views it's like
[3887.58 --> 3894.78]  oh man but in some cases in some cases they changed the content and it's just not working anymore
[3894.78 --> 3900.14]  in some cases they didn't change the content and that's contributing to it not working anymore
[3900.14 --> 3908.78]  and in other cases i'm looking at it going i can't really tell the difference um you know i the point is not
[3908.78 --> 3915.74]  to to name and shame no but this person in particular did like a a series um
[3915.74 --> 3923.58]  um or wait is this is the right one i think i know what when you're talking oh here we go here we go
[3923.58 --> 3930.14]  this one this one yeah um let me just make sure because i don't want to
[3934.22 --> 3935.02]  yeah yeah yeah
[3935.02 --> 3947.34]  i don't know but basically i might not name it yeah yeah there was a creator that was doing real
[3947.34 --> 3956.46]  amazing and then just kind of completely fell off the map i'm talking like her top video has over 50
[3956.46 --> 3964.78]  million views 11 years ago and there's multiple videos here with 10 million views and more doing
[3964.78 --> 3971.74]  challenges and stuff and then just you know she's she's talked about this i think if if i'm remembering
[3971.74 --> 3981.66]  correctly she's talked about how it felt like she just disappeared overnight algorithmically and
[3981.66 --> 3990.78]  again this is a channel with millions of subscribers nobody nobody is nobody is safe yeah
[3993.26 --> 3995.34]  um let me just see
[3997.90 --> 4006.38]  yeah oh okay yes okay it's glosell um so she did an interview talking about how she went broke uh shared
[4006.38 --> 4014.38]  some advice for young creators and um yeah being yeah this is this is great being broke with millions
[4014.38 --> 4021.34]  of subscribers she shares her story of hardship yeah yeah it's uh it's a really it's a really interesting
[4022.14 --> 4029.34]  fall right because it it's not the type of content that i consume so i'm not really qualified to
[4029.34 --> 4035.90]  evaluate whether you know she changed or or didn't change or what what the problem was
[4036.38 --> 4044.78]  that caused this precipitous decline in viewership but no one's no one's safe that's that's the whole
[4044.78 --> 4051.18]  point um so we're we just need to we need to keep reinventing we need to keep pushing and we can never take
[4051.18 --> 4059.58]  our foot off the gas because if we do we die it's uh i i often use shark analogies internally stop swimming die
[4060.14 --> 4063.26]  yeah yeah like actually though
[4066.94 --> 4072.62]  okay so i think we go back to news sure why not give me a couple additional topics
[4073.90 --> 4083.50]  all right uh secret gigabyte back door uh security researchers at eclipseum released findings showing
[4083.50 --> 4090.70]  millions of gigabyte motherboards were sold with a uefi boot kit containing an insecure back door
[4090.70 --> 4096.86]  eclipseum says the hidden code is meant to be uh an innocuous tool to keep the motherboard's firmware
[4096.86 --> 4102.14]  updated but it's been implemented insecurely potentially allowing the mechanism to be hijacked
[4102.70 --> 4108.30]  on windows machines the program writes a windows.exe embed into the firmware to
[4110.14 --> 4117.10]  in the firmware to disk in the system32 folder and runs it the exe sets itself up as a windows
[4117.10 --> 4122.46]  service and attempts to fetch and an executable from one of the urls that is the that is brutal
[4122.94 --> 4130.54]  one url uses http which is easily for an attacker to intercept and other links which do use https
[4130.54 --> 4135.66]  are similarly vulnerable due to poorly implemented remote server certificate certificate validation
[4135.66 --> 4143.66]  wow okay so let's uh let's let's do a real quick summary here in the firmware yeah on this motherboard
[4143.66 --> 4149.82]  they have a tool that allows them to update and keep updated the uefi bios okay sounds cool which
[4149.82 --> 4159.34]  is really cool yes but the firmware actually can just write an exe to the system32 folder which disguise
[4159.34 --> 4167.74]  the windows service i want to know how microsoft allows random exes to be written to the system32 folder
[4167.74 --> 4175.18]  to be clear i'm not saying gigabyte is innocent here yeah i'm just that's messy i'm saying that
[4175.18 --> 4185.58]  this is clearly a breakdown that has multiple contributing actors here yeah oh wow okay so one
[4185.58 --> 4190.62]  note which is probably understood by most but because this program is within the firmware it is difficult
[4190.62 --> 4199.66]  for consumers to remove okay but the next note at least 271 different models of motherboard are affected
[4199.66 --> 4209.74]  including the most recent z790 and x670 skews holy crap there is no current evidence of the vulnerability
[4209.74 --> 4215.42]  being exploited this is a pretty niche thing i wouldn't be surprised if most places were unaware that it
[4215.42 --> 4221.42]  existed a day after the story broke gigabyte has apparently rolled out updated firmware to mitigate
[4221.42 --> 4226.14]  the issue including updates for older motherboards that are affected but the problem is that there's
[4226.14 --> 4232.62]  going to be literally tons of people that don't update because people very very rarely millions if not
[4232.62 --> 4238.46]  hundreds of thousands of boards out there that will never get these updates and never even know this
[4238.46 --> 4245.34]  is a problem i mean i i have to well wait could they use their could they use their updater to
[4245.34 --> 4251.82]  use their tool oh to like force an update that's a good question they might actually be able to kind
[4251.82 --> 4259.82]  of solve the problem that's uh that's a really good that's a really good question um guys uh that's not
[4259.82 --> 4265.34]  in our doc let us know float plane chat uh in the meantime though our discussion question here is
[4265.34 --> 4273.42]  how would you rate gigabytes handling of the issue i mean the issue has existed for years but they probably
[4273.42 --> 4278.38]  didn't know they mitigated it really quickly what i'm assuming happened is eclipsium found it told
[4278.38 --> 4284.62]  gigabyte allowed gigabyte to fix it but then still wanted to break the news that makes sense so they
[4284.62 --> 4290.38]  launched the fix and the news at the same time but they did fix it yeah which is which is good yeah um
[4290.38 --> 4297.34]  but they put in a back door which is which is bad yeah but the back door was not for you know sending
[4297.34 --> 4303.10]  your data to the ccp it was for helping keep your firmware up to date yeah which is noble enough
[4303.10 --> 4308.22]  good yeah but they didn't tell us which is bad
[4312.78 --> 4317.34]  yeah the good the good part is that they fixed it stuff like this is gonna happen i i don't want to be
[4317.34 --> 4324.62]  the that guy that's just like excusing it but um i think we also have to be somewhat realistic
[4324.62 --> 4332.06]  i feel like a lot of the time coverage of problems with products forgets the human element
[4332.86 --> 4338.22]  did you kind of get what i mean by that yeah yeah like this seems like i mean it seems like a mistake
[4338.22 --> 4342.46]  it's not good i wouldn't be happy about it if i was a consumer of a gigabyte motherboard that this
[4342.46 --> 4352.62]  affected um but like it's also fixed immediately so it's not like it's not like gigabyte was like yeah
[4352.62 --> 4359.34]  that's um 271 models of motherboard we don't feel like supporting some of these old motherboards
[4359.34 --> 4364.22]  as far as i can tell at least from the notes in here they updated everything and as long as you
[4364.22 --> 4369.58]  do your own due diligence or maybe this thing can auto update itself yeah but i mean huh that's a
[4369.58 --> 4374.54]  really good point because that's one of those things that worked out this time but wouldn't
[4374.54 --> 4379.10]  necessarily have i mean look at spectre and meltdown yeah intel was basically just like
[4379.10 --> 4390.14]  like yeah it's been a long time that stuff's legacy forget it and that's not cool i get it but that's
[4391.18 --> 4399.82]  not cool um and if this if we hadn't found this for another five years would they have gotten updated
[4399.82 --> 4408.30]  probably not probably not probably not and so yeah good you know good guy gigabyte you know dealing
[4408.30 --> 4415.10]  with it but also it's far better to just not do that in the first place for sure i just like i don't
[4415.10 --> 4420.30]  know it's good if a company exists for a long enough period of time something like this is gonna happen
[4421.02 --> 4426.30]  yeah we've uh uninfamous alex says we forget the human element because we're treated so poorly
[4426.30 --> 4435.26]  um anti-consumer market it's become uh yoda is writing into the show here and you know what yeah i
[4436.46 --> 4443.10]  you know i i get it uh and i think that's you know i think that's pretty i think that's pretty fair
[4443.10 --> 4452.06]  in a lot of cases but i also think that you know what maybe part of it is just that i i get to i get to
[4452.06 --> 4457.42]  be face to face with the people who build these products sometimes and knowing that they're trying
[4457.42 --> 4463.90]  really hard makes me more appreciative of the things that do go well sometimes and it's not in
[4463.90 --> 4470.94]  like uh it's it's not in a like a oh i'm you know compromised kind of way like it's it's not about
[4470.94 --> 4476.78]  money changing hands like i remember getting a pretty different perspective on intel when i went to the
[4476.78 --> 4482.78]  optane launch event it was super data center focused but some of the gaming folks who were
[4482.78 --> 4488.46]  involved like directly involved in bringing skull trail to market that was their super cool dual
[4488.46 --> 4493.58]  socket enthusiast thing that was really expensive and like kind of dumb but it was awesome though but
[4493.58 --> 4499.66]  very cool um were there and just talking about how hard they push internally for these cool skunk
[4499.66 --> 4506.22]  works projects and stuff like that and it just they didn't they didn't pay me any money or anything
[4506.22 --> 4510.94]  like that it just you know you meet people and you get a better understanding of what they're
[4510.94 --> 4517.74]  about and you learn that even these soulless companies and the shareholders i i have not changed how
[4517.74 --> 4523.90]  i feel about shareholders yeah yeah yeah yeah at all yeah shareholders are are are they're
[4525.34 --> 4532.94]  a necessary evil i think is the nicest thing i can say about shareholders uh for public companies in
[4532.94 --> 4542.78]  particular where the only the only outcome they want typically speaking is more money right um so i
[4542.78 --> 4548.78]  haven't changed how i feel about them but the actual workers the actual people the engineers the the
[4548.78 --> 4555.50]  designers the janitors it doesn't matter the people who are working on bringing us these products a lot
[4555.50 --> 4561.74]  of the time they're really passionate they actually love what they do another really surprising moment for me
[4561.74 --> 4569.66]  was when i went to micron and that was a sponsored video so you know take this for whatever whatever
[4569.66 --> 4575.50]  you can talk about what a shill i am or whatever but that's has nothing to do with it um i was just
[4575.50 --> 4583.66]  blown away by how excited these people were to make better memory and to get a chance to talk about it
[4583.66 --> 4589.42]  yeah that's the other thing guys that's a big one these are not professional actors who are pretending to be so
[4589.42 --> 4595.74]  happy dappy working at micron so that i'll make a nice video about them it's not it's not like that these
[4595.74 --> 4603.42]  were these were like the people who actually work on this stuff and you can tell when someone's passionate because
[4603.42 --> 4607.74]  you ask a question and they talk for 10 minutes i was gonna say they won't stop talking about it yeah
[4607.74 --> 4615.02]  finally someone has asked me this yeah do you know how long i toiled on this particular problem
[4615.90 --> 4624.22]  and you know other than my direct manager everyone else in my life i'm bound by nda
[4624.22 --> 4633.02]  right like i'm just so thrilled to be talking to somebody about this you know and it's it's so cool right
[4633.02 --> 4640.78]  and like it was the same at the intel design lab um that i visited in um in tel aviv right like it
[4641.66 --> 4650.22]  these people were just you know in some cases the products were honestly not ones that i
[4650.94 --> 4658.14]  personally enjoyed sure yeah but they were really proud of how they you know set a target and you know
[4658.14 --> 4663.34]  in collaboration with management who was beholden to shareholders but this team you know damn it they
[4663.34 --> 4669.42]  couldn't control that but they set a target and dang it they hit it you know time and time again um
[4669.42 --> 4674.22]  and this this isn't a fab team so intel's had a lot of challenges shrinking their process nodes but this
[4674.22 --> 4679.98]  was uh like a chip design team and and they were just proud they were just proud of the work they were
[4679.98 --> 4685.74]  doing i'm like that's cool you know that's really cool and i want to i want to support that and i've
[4685.74 --> 4692.14]  got to understand that there's a lot of people watching when we make a video and some of them are
[4692.14 --> 4696.62]  the consumers and we need to talk to them about whether you should or shouldn't actually buy this
[4696.62 --> 4704.46]  thing and some of them are the shareholders um and some of them are the people who actually designed
[4704.46 --> 4710.46]  these products and you know i just i want to show respect um and i think we've taken some criticism
[4710.46 --> 4717.42]  recently for how we how we show both sides of a product but i think that's really important we
[4717.42 --> 4724.78]  should appreciate what's good i mean do we do we want to get so jaded and cynical that we that we just
[4724.78 --> 4731.42]  can't appreciate the good of the tech that we can't just take joy in how cool this stuff is anymore
[4731.42 --> 4735.98]  there's also and i i've talked to you about this but this is actually something that has consumed a
[4735.98 --> 4742.54]  surprisingly large amount of my thoughts lately which is i've noticed this i feel like it's
[4742.54 --> 4748.54]  surprisingly recent but maybe i just haven't been super tuned in uh but i've noticed a trend where a
[4748.54 --> 4758.54]  lot of the audience is very intent on all of the reviewers whether written or or video or whatever
[4758.54 --> 4764.94]  all saying the same thing they want everyone to say the exact same thing i think that's super bad
[4764.94 --> 4770.46]  and very dangerous interesting my reasoning is too much group think going on right now i think there is
[4770.46 --> 4775.90]  definitely too much group think going on right now my reason for that is i think it's beneficial not only
[4775.90 --> 4783.82]  to the audience but to all the reviewers as well regardless of what medium they have to have reviewers
[4783.82 --> 4789.26]  taking different approaches trying different things coming to slightly different conclusions
[4789.26 --> 4795.26]  and then you as the audience check out a bunch of different pieces of content and make up your own
[4795.26 --> 4800.62]  mind based on these different approaches that is how i think it should work that is how i think it has
[4800.62 --> 4805.90]  worked for a really long time so when you absorb some piece of content whether you're reading it or
[4805.90 --> 4811.74]  watching or listening to it or whatever and then go to a different one and see a slightly different take
[4811.74 --> 4817.18]  and all of a sudden one of them has to be right yeah and one of them has to be wrong yeah i don't
[4817.18 --> 4824.94]  think that's good right i think that's bad um so just want to throw that out there i think that's like
[4824.94 --> 4830.54]  actually extremely bad and i think this is one of those situations and i i hazard to say this type of
[4830.54 --> 4837.58]  stuff but like you don't want that yeah like i think you're you're you're chasing the wrong thing i i think
[4837.58 --> 4843.66]  the if you get to the result of what this thing is it's going to be just bad for everybody because
[4843.66 --> 4848.38]  you're going to get crazy consolidation there will be less reviewers there will be and then that will
[4848.38 --> 4854.14]  result in less things being found and it's just i mean i think it's a pretty clear i think i've always
[4854.14 --> 4862.30]  been consistent more competition is more better yes and we can't say that about hardware manufacturers and
[4862.30 --> 4869.66]  not and then and then go oh but but but but but we need to be the only reviewer that you uh listen to
[4869.66 --> 4880.62]  yeah no one voice should ever ever be the only one in your ear that's always bad every single time
[4880.62 --> 4887.02]  it will never work out well and that's one of the reasons that we have tried to be so collaborative
[4887.02 --> 4892.78]  with the rest of the tech community i mean i think recently we've talked about how obviously you know
[4892.78 --> 4898.30]  we're trying to build our organization to build the best possible content yeah we can you have to and
[4898.86 --> 4903.98]  you know if uh if people are finding it hard to deliver the same quality of content then like
[4905.18 --> 4912.30]  sorry um you know find a different angle right you know and you know let's go but we've also tried
[4912.30 --> 4916.86]  to work hard to you know build a spirit of collaboration in the tech community as well i mean
[4916.86 --> 4921.18]  you name a tech creator and we've probably collaborated with them at some point or if we
[4921.18 --> 4926.38]  haven't we've probably invited them to ltx this year there's actually a lot of creators that i have
[4926.38 --> 4931.74]  never even met that are coming to ltx this year and i'm super excited we want to we want to bring
[4931.74 --> 4936.06]  people together we want to i want to see collabs i think it's going to be really exciting it's going
[4936.06 --> 4941.90]  to be really fun um and that's because we're putting our money where our mouth is we're literally spending
[4942.62 --> 4950.14]  six figures on creator travel and hotels for ltx we're spending a freaking lot of money um to put
[4950.14 --> 4955.58]  our money where our mouth is and and show that we actually do care about this you guys should have
[4955.58 --> 4962.54]  as many voices as possible uh when you're trying to evaluate what to spend your hard-earned money on
[4962.54 --> 4970.46]  because nobody is going to see things exactly the way you do and if they do you got to kind of look in
[4970.46 --> 4977.10]  the mirror and go are these actually my thoughts or are these just someone else's thoughts and i'm
[4977.10 --> 4984.06]  just parroting them am i actually doing any critical thinking here that's something never stop critically
[4984.06 --> 4990.54]  thinking for yourself um i realize i never kind of came back to have i buried the hatchet with nvidia
[4991.10 --> 4997.98]  someone asked have i have i resolved things with jensen i haven't talked to jensen in many years i think
[4997.98 --> 5003.50]  the last time i talked to jensen was just to like introduce myself at an event or something like
[5003.50 --> 5011.10]  that like i've never really spoken with him at length or anything um but i definitely had some
[5011.10 --> 5019.74]  issues with our previous nvidia rep who simply um revealed to me regardless of the apology that went
[5019.74 --> 5026.22]  out to hardware and boxed afterward revealed to me through his actions that he didn't respect media
[5026.78 --> 5033.58]  didn't properly understand our role in keeping nvidia accountable uh felt that we were simply
[5034.46 --> 5038.30]  part of nvidia's marketing apparatus and um
[5040.70 --> 5046.78]  and at that point i just uh you know i never apologized for anything that i said i think maybe
[5046.78 --> 5052.46]  an apology was expected but um i wasn't going to apologize because at the end of the day i didn't say
[5052.46 --> 5063.42]  anything that was wrong and um you know it was it was my team my group uh my my media community that
[5063.42 --> 5068.30]  was disrespected um you know i don't owe you an apology for calling you out for being disrespectful
[5068.30 --> 5076.54]  like that's actually not how that works and that particular rep is no longer with the company um so that
[5076.54 --> 5084.62]  they are retired now and i met my new rep so they they started just a few weeks ago i think
[5085.26 --> 5090.62]  so before you before you jump in with conspiracy theories about how we're you know that's oh that's
[5090.62 --> 5096.30]  why our video was you know more balanced for the 40 60 or whatever no that's just how we're going to
[5096.30 --> 5101.10]  make videos where we want to look at everything we want to look at it from shine a light on it from
[5101.10 --> 5106.38]  every angle um so this is my first time meeting them but they basically came in and were like hey
[5107.34 --> 5119.26]  i wanna i wanna have a fresh start here and i kind of went that's nice uh it was it was a tough meeting
[5119.82 --> 5125.74]  it wasn't you know all sunshine and rainbows yeah well i mean there's some there's some
[5125.74 --> 5133.18]  there's some there's some old wounds to deal with there yeah there's been this is why it's always
[5133.18 --> 5143.26]  so funny to me to be told that i'm some kind of nvidia shill i like good products and so that's not a
[5143.26 --> 5153.66]  bias yeah that's not being a fanboy yeah that's just evaluating things and then seeing how they are
[5153.66 --> 5160.46]  and forming an opinion that's not that's not bias if something is good and you think it's good that's
[5161.18 --> 5167.18]  that's just fact right like that's yeah and and and again though back to what we said before my
[5167.18 --> 5174.30]  fact is not necessarily your fact right if i love this product for gaming and you use some kind of
[5174.30 --> 5178.86]  professional software and it's been they've had this bug for three years that completely ruins your
[5178.86 --> 5184.94]  life and you need to use something else that's yeah that's your life right like that's that's your
[5184.94 --> 5191.50]  perspective and that's totally valid right but for me it doesn't it doesn't make me a fan to say this is
[5191.50 --> 5198.70]  a good product that works really well uh it's expensive but you got to give it to them it works really well
[5199.26 --> 5204.22]  um where was i going with this i totally can't remember because my brain is bad
[5204.22 --> 5210.06]  uh right yeah i always get a kick out of it when people think i'm some kind of nvidia shill nvidia
[5210.06 --> 5220.62]  has done so little sponsored and paid work with us over the years that i don't even think they would
[5220.62 --> 5228.38]  register as like uh like how many decimal places would we have to get to so you've got percentages of
[5228.38 --> 5233.98]  our total total overall income and then you've got like a decimal of a percentage i don't even think
[5233.98 --> 5240.38]  they'd be at one decimal i think they'd be at two like they are functionally most years there's
[5240.38 --> 5247.66]  nothing yeah they've only worked with us like twice yeah like actually functionally negligible yeah um
[5249.10 --> 5255.66]  and which made it particularly funny to me when i heard through the grapevine back after the hardware
[5255.66 --> 5262.46]  unbox thing that nvidia was putting pressure on their partners that they give marketing funds to to not spend
[5262.46 --> 5271.34]  those funds with us because even accounting for pass through it's like negligible like not a non-factor
[5271.34 --> 5277.26]  so they they tried to put this allegedly tried to put this i heard from two two sources though they
[5277.26 --> 5281.66]  tried to put this financial pressure on us after the hardware unbox thing that's another thing is like
[5281.66 --> 5289.18]  they apologized to hardware unboxed i never got an apology for that um so there's been some i am not a fan
[5289.18 --> 5296.78]  of nvidia and the way that they do business and so i made that very clear i made that extremely clear
[5296.78 --> 5303.50]  to our new rep that this relationship is not going to be repaired by coming in and saying you know what
[5303.50 --> 5313.98]  would be great a fresh start uh yeah yeah sure i guess that would be great um but you're gonna have to
[5313.98 --> 5321.66]  figure this out because as far as i can tell a lot of nvidia's behaviors are not as simple as one rep
[5321.66 --> 5330.62]  going rogue disrespecting the media and engaging in these mafia thug business tactics um i've seen
[5330.62 --> 5336.38]  nvidia engage with their manufacturing partners in the same way their board partners um i've i've seen
[5336.38 --> 5343.42]  nvidia engage with their retail partners in the same way nvidia is a cutthroat company they are
[5344.14 --> 5350.78]  competitive they compete and maybe that's a big part of the reason they win so much but that doesn't
[5350.78 --> 5357.02]  mean that they can't be respectful while they're while they're competing that doesn't mean they can't
[5357.02 --> 5362.86]  share some of the spoils of war you know we saw the way that they've squeezed margins for their for
[5362.86 --> 5368.86]  their board partners for example over the years and so i basically said look i think that realistically a
[5368.86 --> 5375.98]  lot of the problems i have with nvidia are not as simple as a fresh start um i appreciate anything
[5375.98 --> 5384.14]  that you think that you can do and what i can tell you is i will i will have an open mind um you know i
[5384.14 --> 5389.42]  will i will try to have a fresh start but you're going to have to understand that there's going to be
[5389.42 --> 5396.38]  more to this than just the way that you treat me right i i just i love this i love this saying or
[5396.38 --> 5401.82]  expression or whatever it is where you know a man that's kind to you and rude to a waiter is a rude
[5401.82 --> 5410.22]  man right um and i experienced that a lot being uh being a prominent creator in the tech community
[5410.22 --> 5417.82]  community it is pretty easy for me to get prompt service on something which is a big part of the
[5417.82 --> 5423.74]  reason that we do secret shopper which is a big part of the reason that we are introducing our secret
[5423.74 --> 5429.66]  shopping our sponsors series which is going to be kicking off very soon i believe all of the
[5430.22 --> 5436.38]  background has been done but the person who is working on that has other projects so it's taking
[5436.38 --> 5441.66]  some time to get everything compiled and turn it into a script but i'm i'm really really excited to
[5441.66 --> 5446.94]  bring that series to you guys uh because we want to we want to know like are we just getting good
[5446.94 --> 5455.02]  treatment because nvidia wants to project being a nice guy through their treatment of us and turn us
[5455.02 --> 5462.38]  into fans it's something we've always got to watch out for and you know maybe this is maybe i'm jaded and
[5462.38 --> 5469.26]  cynical maybe uh maybe i'm just experienced sometimes i can't tell the difference but it's the kind of
[5469.26 --> 5474.54]  thing that brands do they do it all the time and that's not being that's just being realistic and it
[5474.54 --> 5481.02]  was it was funny because there was another classic brand move that got pulled on this trip that uh i was
[5481.02 --> 5486.14]  a little frustrated with one of our team members for not being aware of and then i kind of you know i kind
[5486.14 --> 5495.34]  of when i talked to them yesterday and basically like i had said some some pretty direct words um
[5496.06 --> 5501.90]  previously and i don't take any of them back um you know you you know who you are it had to you had
[5501.90 --> 5507.82]  to hear it i i want you to i want you to learn i want you to get more experienced i want you to
[5509.02 --> 5513.90]  to to do better because like sandwiched a little better though yeah but i could have i could have done
[5513.90 --> 5519.82]  a better job of the poop sandwich um but you know these are important life skills regardless of
[5519.82 --> 5523.10]  whether you're going to work here forever you're going to work somewhere else you got it you got
[5523.10 --> 5527.18]  to learn these things you got to take these with you and so i'm glad i told you but i could have been
[5527.18 --> 5535.82]  a bit nicer about it but basically what i said is like look brands have their agenda you have your
[5535.82 --> 5540.54]  agenda and you've got to keep these things separate you've got to understand you don't work for them
[5540.54 --> 5547.02]  and they are going to use every possible trick in the book to manipulate you into doing what they
[5547.02 --> 5553.02]  want and in this case it was a sponsored project that was supposed to happen while we were here
[5553.58 --> 5557.58]  actually it was a couple things but the the one that started it was the sponsored project that was
[5557.58 --> 5565.02]  supposed to happen here with a big board maker where i wanted to see a gpu manufacturing line
[5565.02 --> 5571.90]  and i basically said sponsorship deal or no sponsorship deal i'm not going unless we're
[5571.90 --> 5578.78]  seeing a gpu manufacturing line i want to see a gpu go start to finish and then i want to power it on
[5578.78 --> 5586.86]  kind of like what we did at the micron factory and in the lead up to the show you know i kept being told
[5586.86 --> 5591.82]  okay yeah we haven't confirmed exactly what it's going to be we haven't confirmed we haven't confirmed
[5591.82 --> 5598.14]  yet and i'm like you need to get this confirmed you have to get this confirmed we are flying 11 hours
[5598.14 --> 5604.94]  around the world or whatever it is and you got to get this confirmed before we go and i can see why
[5604.94 --> 5611.10]  it might not have seemed that urgent because we were going to computex anyway yeah right but when
[5611.10 --> 5619.98]  you're negotiating something the more things you leave until the moment when you arrive the more potential
[5619.98 --> 5625.82]  there is for what happened next which is that on the day we were supposed to go and shoot this video
[5625.82 --> 5631.98]  we were contacted in the morning and told hey we can't make the gpu manufacturing line work but what
[5631.98 --> 5640.54]  we do have is a new model of gpu that you can show and some cases and um some upcoming like extremely
[5640.54 --> 5649.34]  basic level boring computex content yeah the like normal normal content computex um so yeah the sponsor
[5649.34 --> 5658.78]  deal is still on but uh it's gonna be this and i kind of went okay i made this really clear when i said
[5658.78 --> 5666.70]  before the show that the sponsorship deal is not on unless we are bringing content about gpu manufacturing
[5666.70 --> 5675.74]  to the people i meant it that's not it's not negotiable it's not a conversation i i don't want to be
[5675.74 --> 5682.94]  talking about this right now because i already told you and the thing is like i'm not trying to be
[5685.26 --> 5693.90]  i'm not trying to be a jerk about it but i am beholden to my boss and i don't mean our incoming ceo
[5694.70 --> 5703.02]  i mean you guys you guys are the boss if i upload crap you guys are gonna download it or worse you're
[5703.02 --> 5708.14]  gonna not watch it yeah and then we talked about you know exponential channel decay that's gonna
[5708.14 --> 5715.18]  happen it's a fight for survival every day if i bring you guys regardless of sponsorship dollars
[5715.18 --> 5719.90]  right like that's what i'm you know that's what ultimately i have to do if i want to get sponsorship
[5720.86 --> 5729.10]  dollars i have to find a way to cram those into a project that is entertaining enough for you guys that
[5729.10 --> 5735.50]  you want to watch it regardless of that right so you know i will i will sometimes take a project that
[5735.50 --> 5740.86]  i would just love to do like i would just i would just love to see the micron factory tour that's
[5740.86 --> 5747.26]  actually a great example i would have wanted to go regardless of the money but i'll hold out i'll
[5747.26 --> 5754.78]  basically go no it's got to be paid um because realistically for something like that they're gonna
[5754.78 --> 5760.78]  they're gonna need a whole bunch of uh like nda like type of privacy tons of reviews yeah privacy
[5760.78 --> 5765.10]  control over it anyway so if they're gonna expect all of that then i'm sitting here going well then
[5765.10 --> 5769.74]  yeah then you pay the sponsorship dollar or i'm not going even though i'm sitting there going please
[5771.34 --> 5778.14]  please do it right um so so that's what happened with this board maker is i basically went look i i told
[5778.14 --> 5785.74]  you we're not going because my boss says that's not interesting enough so we aren't going unless this
[5785.74 --> 5793.26]  is happening and i think everyone was sort of taken aback including the person on my team who kind of
[5793.26 --> 5801.58]  went oh when i said okay well we're not going then we're gonna go shoot something else and we ended up
[5801.58 --> 5806.46]  going to the gigabyte booth where we shot that cool uh gray super chip video that was actually that
[5806.46 --> 5814.14]  was a lot of fun and uh later on in the week we made another attempt at it and whether it was
[5814.78 --> 5821.10]  a miscommunication or whether it was another uh effort to just get us on site so they could get
[5821.10 --> 5827.98]  us to talk about something else again um we arrived and it wasn't a manufacturing line or even a
[5827.98 --> 5831.34]  prototyping line which is what i thought we were going to see i thought we were going to see a
[5831.34 --> 5841.10]  prototyping line it was just like some pcbs and some finished gpus and a soldering iron which is
[5841.10 --> 5851.98]  not how they do it which is not how they build gpus at all yeah um and so we we shot a quick um short
[5851.98 --> 5858.22]  for one of the channels and we just like left and you know maybe it was a miscommunication maybe it was um
[5858.22 --> 5862.14]  you know maybe they just wanted to get us in there to talk about this other stuff they wanted to talk
[5862.14 --> 5866.94]  about i'm not sure but it was a it was a really valuable learning experience i think for the way
[5866.94 --> 5873.34]  that the way that brands will will try to get you close you'll get you in the door and then once
[5873.34 --> 5877.98]  you're already there kind of go oh well sunk cost fallacy you might as well talk about this other
[5877.98 --> 5881.98]  thing because you know it'd be a shame you've experienced it a bunch even even when you do have a
[5881.98 --> 5887.98]  really solid agreement it's it's often attempted yep yeah we had we had an issue with a case
[5887.98 --> 5893.34]  manufacturer this year where we wanted to do something cool with one of their products um
[5893.90 --> 5897.74]  and they were showing it at this one location but we wanted to do something at the other location
[5898.38 --> 5902.46]  and they didn't want to give us the one that was at the one location for some reason and they
[5902.46 --> 5909.10]  basically made us borrowing it contingent on going to their party their their event and i was like okay
[5909.10 --> 5914.38]  i'll go but i can't stay long because i have a commitment i'm playing badminton tonight and i'm
[5914.38 --> 5919.02]  only going to go if there's food because and i'm not trying to i'm not trying to be a diva about it
[5919.66 --> 5928.14]  but i'm on my way out the door to get food before i go exercise i cannot go to exercise before i've eaten
[5928.14 --> 5933.74]  so i can't go to your event unless there's food there i arrived there was no food there was like
[5933.74 --> 5942.70]  like like a dozen of the last hors d'oeuvres that nobody wanted left and there was um and immediately
[5942.70 --> 5946.94]  they started trying to brief me on their like products that i didn't come there to talk about
[5947.98 --> 5953.18]  um and then what's even worse is before we got a chance to do anything with the thing we borrowed
[5953.18 --> 5961.26]  they asked for it back and um one of our team members uh went full just like errand person for
[5961.26 --> 5965.98]  them and like brought it back to them when we would have been going the next morning anyway and i was
[5965.98 --> 5971.66]  like so that was again you know like hey these are the moves brands pull they try they try and make you
[5971.66 --> 5978.86]  their beta and you can't you can't be there for that it's the answer is the answer is no and it's not
[5978.86 --> 5983.18]  about being a jerk it's about standing your ground right and i don't know maybe it's just like is it
[5983.18 --> 5990.14]  like a like a canadian cultural thing just like wanting to be a people pleaser did i did i used to
[5990.14 --> 5997.98]  be more like that have i just no have i just gotten oh well okay then i think i think back in the day
[5997.98 --> 6003.82]  the video would have been made but i think for different reasons yeah i think back in the day we
[6003.82 --> 6010.54]  we valued volume very highly yeah so we would just get a lot of content out all the time so like
[6014.06 --> 6018.22]  it's always it's always kind of funny to me when people talk about how much better our content used
[6018.22 --> 6024.30]  to be when we used to focus on quality videos from a show what are you talking about sure dude we upload
[6024.30 --> 6030.06]  less now than ever um we used to have a thing at ces where you had 30 minutes per appointment and
[6030.06 --> 6040.54]  that included travel time yeah which could be switching hotels yeah like there was not time for
[6040.54 --> 6048.22]  for quality my dude yeah man looking back at old videos like there were certainly some fun and funny
[6048.22 --> 6055.42]  just dragon energy things that happened but i don't know about i don't know if quality is the right word
[6055.42 --> 6061.98]  to describe anything that we used to do compared to what we do today yeah this is an impromptu topic
[6061.98 --> 6067.82]  sorry i'm kind of blindsiding you with this but i wanted to talk about why we didn't cover one of the
[6067.82 --> 6074.70]  big pieces of news at the show this year this was another sort of having to having to draw a line in
[6074.70 --> 6081.90]  the sand uh we were supposed to get seven videos this week and we ultimately didn't end up making one of
[6081.90 --> 6090.46]  them because partly through my own error we arrived at a booth and realized that the people that we were
[6090.46 --> 6101.58]  about to cover had ripped off the community oh in the past yeah and i had um you know not intentionally
[6101.58 --> 6108.86]  but i had been complicit and um that's not about to happen again yeah and that that's not going to
[6108.86 --> 6115.10]  happen again so uh one of the one of the big things at the show was this super cool and i saw it i was
[6115.10 --> 6124.14]  briefed on it it's super cool but this collaborative case between strecom and calios that's capable of
[6124.14 --> 6132.14]  dissipating uh they say 600 but actually it's more like 700 watts passively depending on um
[6132.14 --> 6139.82]  um the thermal output of your cpu and gpu so it has two loops and they're identical but they rate
[6139.82 --> 6147.18]  i think the cpu one slightly lower just because most cpus are not going to hit that level anyway
[6147.18 --> 6151.82]  or something like that i forget there's some there's some reason that one of them is like rated a little
[6151.82 --> 6157.18]  bit lower when they talk about the product overall but actually if you had a differently balanced system
[6157.18 --> 6165.58]  it could it could even dissipate a little bit more heat um so i arrived oh right so first let's talk
[6165.58 --> 6171.74]  about who these folks are so streetcom tons of respect i love those guys they do just a just great
[6171.74 --> 6179.34]  great job of manufacturing super sleek aluminum cases and accessories and stuff like that um in fact
[6179.34 --> 6185.82]  they make the test benches that we use for the lab uh really cool modular test benches that like pack flat
[6185.82 --> 6196.14]  like awesome um actually hold on yeah that is streetcom right yeah yeah the open bench table yeah that thing is sick
[6196.70 --> 6204.78]  uh just have like uh is it street yeah yeah yeah it's true cool uh so streetcom makes that um love those guys
[6205.90 --> 6214.14]  now let's talk about calios do you guys remember the passive like 300 watt or 350 watt case from like
[6214.14 --> 6220.70]  six years ago kickstarter campaign do you remember this thing it was pumpless which was super cool so
[6220.70 --> 6228.94]  it's full of refrigerant and then the heat from the cpu or well i mean or gpu and gpu whatever um would
[6228.94 --> 6234.06]  force uh would cause the refrigerant to evaporate and then it would start moving and then it would
[6234.06 --> 6239.66]  condense and then it would it would actually start flowing on its own without any kind of pumping system
[6239.66 --> 6246.06]  so the whole thing was completely silent super cool tech they raised a quarter million dollars on
[6246.06 --> 6257.26]  kickstarter give or take and then ghosted um nobody who bought one of yeah nobody who bought one of those
[6257.26 --> 6265.66]  original cases ever um got anything for their money as far as i can tell and this was a significant amount
[6265.66 --> 6271.10]  of money this case was over 500 on average right because remember kickstarter there's the different
[6271.10 --> 6281.10]  tiers depending on how early you uh how early you fund it and i covered the case in fact i covered them
[6281.10 --> 6289.66]  twice once i covered the case actually might have been three times i don't i don't remember anymore but i
[6289.66 --> 6295.98]  definitely covered it at least twice i covered the case in our studio and tested it and it was amazing
[6295.98 --> 6301.34]  and super cool and then i covered another collaborative project they were doing on like a smaller cube
[6301.34 --> 6311.50]  passive system later on at a trade show at ces or something like that and i took a lot of uh so okay yeah
[6311.50 --> 6319.34]  people are people are in the chat here i thought they i thought they collapsed well no they didn't um calios
[6320.06 --> 6329.26]  did existed before and still exists now i mean their main business is um is b2b cooling solutions like
[6329.26 --> 6337.34]  silent um passive cooling solutions and they they work in all kinds of different industries including
[6337.34 --> 6345.18]  like uh they have some history in the aerospace industry for example um and so they they they had the
[6345.18 --> 6351.74]  experience with cooling and they had the the backing they had the reputation as a real company that made
[6351.74 --> 6358.22]  me comfortable promoting this as a product that genuinely would exist where they would overcome the
[6358.22 --> 6367.26]  challenges and actually deliver these to people and they just didn't they just didn't deliver them and i
[6367.26 --> 6372.38]  want to tell both sides of the story here because i actually had the calios founder and i also had the
[6372.38 --> 6380.22]  new ceo of calios they're in the booth with me and they basically went like look we spent three times
[6380.22 --> 6384.78]  the amount of the kickstarter backers trying to make this thing happen there were challenges we didn't
[6384.78 --> 6393.98]  foresee we were naive um it was a smaller team and i'm sorry we didn't deliver anything but uh it was kickstarter
[6394.78 --> 6395.50]  and i kind of went
[6397.66 --> 6400.14]  okay that's not really how that works um
[6400.14 --> 6411.10]  um but what about people's money and they're like okay we have a solution for that and i go okay
[6412.14 --> 6417.58]  i would like to hear your solution because i i basically got the briefing and i told them
[6419.18 --> 6426.78]  we have two we have two paths here either you tell me how you're gonna make this right and it's and i make
[6426.78 --> 6432.46]  good and i make a video about this yeah or you don't tell me how you're gonna make this right and
[6432.46 --> 6440.06]  i walk away and i'm not acknowledging your company here um and they go okay no no we have a solution for
[6440.06 --> 6447.26]  this for everyone who backed the original case they will get a voucher for the full amount of their backing
[6447.26 --> 6456.70]  toward the new case and i went on the surface that sounds possibly pretty okay to note that it's not
[6456.78 --> 6463.02]  a whole new case though um what's the delta here well the new case can dissipate about double the heat
[6464.14 --> 6471.50]  it's a and it's a much nicer looking design it's lighter however however the new case is priced
[6471.50 --> 6480.38]  according to its heat dissipation yeah capabilities yeah so they were offering a credit of 500 and change
[6480.38 --> 6490.62]  500 essentially uh let's say let's say 575 towards a 1000 case and i'm sitting here going
[6494.38 --> 6503.18]  um this is interesting shot key and twitch chat has a has an uncharacteristically terrible take for
[6503.18 --> 6510.22]  twitch chat and that's really something so you blackmailed them no i didn't blackmail them that's not what
[6510.22 --> 6517.02]  blackmail is you should go look up what blackmail is anyway um that's amazing how confused people get
[6517.02 --> 6525.50]  sometimes so sorry they offered so they're offering let's say 600 let's round up they're offering a 600
[6525.50 --> 6534.70]  voucher for a thousand dollar product and i kind of went so are you serious right now you took my money
[6534.70 --> 6539.90]  let's say hypothetically i'm one of these buyers you took my money my significant amount of money
[6539.90 --> 6547.34]  six years ago and you're coming back to me now saying no but we're really gonna ship you something
[6547.34 --> 6560.14]  this time all we need is double your money more money um needless to say i wasn't happy with that i i
[6560.14 --> 6566.06]  didn't consider that acceptable uh i said i said that's a good option that people should have
[6566.86 --> 6572.70]  but at the end of the day they need to also have the option to have their money back
[6573.58 --> 6579.90]  um because the way that it works is if you're a real company that behaves like a real company
[6580.54 --> 6586.46]  when you take someone's money and you don't ship them a product then you should give them their money
[6586.46 --> 6591.34]  back and they kind of went yeah but it was kickstarter it was as it was a small team it was a
[6591.34 --> 6599.98]  you know offshoots skunkworks project i go okay but like this is your integrity we're talking about
[6599.98 --> 6606.94]  i'm not talking about your legal obligations here i'm talking about your integrity as as a company
[6606.94 --> 6613.26]  as a person um the right thing to do if you take someone's money and don't deliver it and don't
[6613.26 --> 6619.34]  deliver the product is to give them their money back and um they basically this is when i was talking to
[6619.34 --> 6623.74]  the founder and they basically went look i have to discuss this with the new ceo let me get back to
[6623.74 --> 6629.26]  you i said okay well i'm gonna go you know check out the rest of the show floor see if there's anything
[6629.26 --> 6635.02]  else cool to cover and we'll we'll go from there and you just here's my cell just give me a call when
[6635.02 --> 6641.10]  you guys have had a chance to talk about it and we'll we'll go from there so i get a call a few hours
[6641.10 --> 6648.22]  later and classic brand tactics they go okay we've talked about it we've come to a solution i'm like
[6648.22 --> 6653.98]  okay cool what is it they're like why don't you swing by the booth and i go why don't we just talk
[6653.98 --> 6660.14]  about it on the phone because it should be a simple answer if the news was good yeah they would just tell
[6660.14 --> 6667.10]  me yeah but i was like realistically you know what um andy and jake are about to order food get me one of
[6667.10 --> 6673.82]  whatever jake's having and i'm gonna hobble over to the booth and um i and i and i will i will tell
[6673.82 --> 6680.46]  them no in their faces because whatever i'm not i'm not afraid of that if they think that bringing me
[6680.46 --> 6685.58]  there is going to somehow make me change my line in the sand that i've drawn then they've got something
[6685.58 --> 6693.58]  else coming um so sure i'll play your game so i get there and they tell me okay you know what if it
[6693.58 --> 6701.18]  was you know what if it was some kind of you know shares in the what what if they got a what if in
[6701.18 --> 6706.86]  addition to the discount they got some kind of share in the profits of the new product i'm sitting here
[6706.86 --> 6714.46]  going what are you even talking about yeah i know that i had discussed how kickstarter is sort of dumb
[6714.46 --> 6722.70]  because it's basically um you know investment where you don't get any equity right um because it's it's
[6722.70 --> 6728.86]  it's it's either buying a product or it's kind of that right and you can't both of them are sort of
[6729.98 --> 6733.50]  well buying a product is fine unless the product doesn't get delivered in which case it's well
[6733.50 --> 6736.86]  basically just taking people's money right um and i kind of went
[6739.58 --> 6744.78]  yeah i mean hey thanks for playing but that's actually not how this works if you guys are a real
[6744.78 --> 6750.14]  company with integrity then what you do is you give them back their money i also run a physical goods
[6750.14 --> 6756.86]  business we also make mistakes from time to time and when we do we eat it and you can always offer
[6756.86 --> 6763.50]  like oh if you don't take a refund and you take a credit towards the next thing will like bump up its
[6763.50 --> 6768.06]  value by a small amount or not even if you're happy with the credit take the credit that too
[6768.06 --> 6771.98]  but getting a refund needs to be an option yeah it should be possible and and i understand what
[6771.98 --> 6777.82]  they're saying they made a car comparison they were like uh you know we originally sold a citroen and
[6777.82 --> 6783.02]  now we're shipping a bmw we can't just like ship everyone who paid for a citroen a bmw and yeah
[6783.02 --> 6789.26]  totally yeah 100 so refund them so refund them um because you didn't ship the citroen you never shipped
[6789.26 --> 6799.02]  it yeah um and so the really baffling thing about this to me is that if callius is a real company and
[6799.02 --> 6808.54]  they really do have any integrity whatsoever um this is such a small price to pay the total backing
[6809.50 --> 6814.06]  was about a quarter million dollars which is a lot of money which is a lot of money on like big
[6814.06 --> 6818.30]  manufacturing business scale but if you're looking to just
[6818.30 --> 6829.26]  just put this in the past for real do it properly and if you want a pr win you basically say look
[6829.82 --> 6836.14]  yeah we'll offer you a refund but we actually think it's a better play if you take the credit
[6836.14 --> 6841.98]  and get this much better case they'd probably convert a lot of people to the new case but
[6841.98 --> 6847.10]  they're trying to they're trying to eat their cake and have it too they're trying to just keep money
[6847.10 --> 6851.66]  from people who are not going to use the credit for the case seem like they're looking like good
[6851.66 --> 6861.74]  guys and launch this new case and kind of go well we tried because no none of those people are unless
[6861.74 --> 6867.10]  they actually you know offer a refund are going to be interested in their new promises and you know
[6867.10 --> 6871.26]  what it might be different this time street commissures me it'll be different i trust them still
[6871.82 --> 6876.54]  because they're the manufacturing partner um helping bring this thing to life and i feel bad for
[6876.54 --> 6882.38]  street con because it seems like they came into this having done nothing wrong ultimately just
[6882.38 --> 6887.66]  recognizing this is a super cool technology and wanting to bring it to gamers so i feel bad for
[6887.66 --> 6895.82]  them right but no at the end of the day this is not a kickstarter there's a big difference for me
[6895.82 --> 6901.02]  between a kickstarter from like a dude in a basement trying to build a hammer
[6901.02 --> 6910.78]  that turns into a crowbar and just ultimately not being able to figure it out and a company
[6911.50 --> 6917.10]  launching a product on kickstarter or launching a new product category on kickstarter in terms of the
[6917.10 --> 6923.90]  the the trust that i have and my expectation that this company will behave in a way that is um
[6923.90 --> 6929.98]  um that protects their reputation right because at the end of the day it's all trust me bro um
[6930.70 --> 6935.50]  so with a with a company that has some kind of established reputation i look at it and i go well
[6935.50 --> 6940.62]  you probably want to maintain that so i can probably safely hand you my money and in this case that was
[6940.62 --> 6946.22]  not the case at all and uh that's kind of a funny pun because there was no case at all they never shipped one
[6946.22 --> 6953.10]  and i i basically said look we're not we're not going to do it so that's that's my
[6956.38 --> 6961.02]  there is still there's still no update on the hammer by the way i just checked the last update
[6961.58 --> 6969.10]  says we're back um june 4th 2022 we're almost at the one year anniversary of that
[6969.10 --> 6973.74]  we're gonna get there it's too bad because i really
[6976.70 --> 6982.94]  yeah yeah here's here's a much better twitch take from tom smith if you see an ad for a 600
[6982.94 --> 6987.82]  case and you go to the store and they say instead you have to buy a thousand dollar case that's called
[6987.82 --> 6993.02]  bait and switch and that's even without collecting any money yes like and yes i know kickstarter's terms
[6993.02 --> 7000.30]  do shield them from any kind of legal liability here but yeah but why would you trust that company
[7000.30 --> 7012.06]  the law is not the be-all and end-all of how we should treat each other yeah like by law you know i'm
[7012.06 --> 7012.70]  allowed to
[7012.70 --> 7023.02]  uh try like you can you can you can be kind of a dick bag and still not break the law you know
[7023.90 --> 7030.62]  that doesn't make it right yeah like uh i mean if you ever yeah flow plane chat is like laws are not
[7030.62 --> 7039.10]  morality legal does not equal ethical yes stuff like that yes law is the bare minimum yes yeah yeah yeah
[7039.10 --> 7045.10]  so we didn't cover it and um i'm you know it's too bad but i i just think at the end of the day they
[7045.10 --> 7052.38]  had they had an opportunity to relatively cheaply actually put this behind them i really wanted to
[7052.38 --> 7059.98]  cover the product not just today but going forward i want i want one you know like i actually want one
[7059.98 --> 7064.14]  and and i wanted the views on it even if i was certain it would show up at this point i would not
[7064.14 --> 7068.54]  personally buy one i wanted the views yeah yeah but would you buy one if they offered a refund to
[7068.54 --> 7073.34]  everyone who didn't get one okay we'll see that's what i'm talking about well okay i'm not like
[7073.34 --> 7077.74]  guaranteeing i would go purchase one immediately but you would definitely consider it because it is
[7077.74 --> 7085.58]  super cool it's a very cool product it's sweet so like yeah it's very possible what's also possible
[7085.58 --> 7093.18]  is for us to tell you about our sponsors oh uh dan hello dan daniel besser hello are you uh set up for this
[7093.18 --> 7103.74]  yeah mr mr besser hello hello daniel can you can you actually not hear me can you hear me no we we
[7103.74 --> 7111.82]  can hear you but well i wasn't gonna tell i refuse we can hear you but we can't see anything so you
[7111.82 --> 7116.38]  kind of just gotta tell us when to go uh yeah sorry that's my favorite super villain
[7116.38 --> 7124.86]  uh we don't actually have any dennis integrations today so um it's just reads all right well let's
[7124.86 --> 7130.86]  read then backblaze is an affordable and easy to use cloud backup solution that starts at just seven
[7130.86 --> 7135.10]  dollars a month how are they still at just seven dollars a month to start pretty wild seriously
[7135.10 --> 7139.58]  though we use backblaze yeah is that in our talking points at this point yeah we actually use backblaze a
[7139.58 --> 7144.54]  lot backblaze is sick yeah they make it simple allowing you to back up almost anything from your mac
[7144.54 --> 7149.26]  or pc and accessing it from anywhere in the world with their web and mobile apps they don't even oh
[7149.26 --> 7153.50]  yeah okay you can also easily protect your business data through a centrally managed admin and they'll
[7153.50 --> 7159.34]  let you restore your data for free via the web or even by mail they will ship you a hard drive with
[7159.34 --> 7163.50]  your data right to your door and when you're done you can return the hard drive for a refund and if
[7163.50 --> 7168.38]  you're worried about accidentally deleting files you can increase your retention history to a year
[7168.38 --> 7176.14]  for get this an extra two dollars a month i'm sure we must pay more than that for extra retention or do
[7176.14 --> 7181.58]  we even have extra retention we we i i don't know off the top of my head but we pay a lot more than that
[7181.58 --> 7187.02]  because we we use multiple services and we use them for multiple companies at this point floatplane backs
[7187.02 --> 7193.82]  up to them linus media group backs up to them right yeah with over 55 billion files restored and two exabytes of
[7193.82 --> 7199.82]  data under the management backblaze has got you covered sign up and get a free 15-day trial no
[7199.82 --> 7206.94]  credit card required at backblaze.com when no credit card required trial i can't i can't endorse
[7206.94 --> 7211.74]  backblaze strongly yeah we we like backblaze we have also liked backblaze for a long time
[7211.74 --> 7216.14]  we also like squarespace yeah we actually use squarespace too if you're looking at creating and

[7259.74 --> 7266.14]  so luke say my talking points as much as you had a blast during the whole hackening debacle
[7266.14 --> 7270.22]  i think we can both agree that cyber attacks are bad yes
[7272.22 --> 7278.30]  well the former national security experts at blackpoint security blackpoint cyber also agree and that's what
[7278.30 --> 7282.78]  drove them to become a leading cyber security company specializing in advanced threat detection

[7318.38 --> 7327.66]  check out the link down below all right now damn what are we supposed to do now we've got uh three more
[7327.66 --> 7334.78]  merch messages is it weird just sitting in the studio by yourself no i'm hanging out with any people on the
[7334.78 --> 7342.38]  internet uh aj's here so i am uh i don't look like a crazy person laughing to myself in an empty warehouse
[7343.74 --> 7348.30]  is aj just sitting on the set yeah yeah we're uh we're eating some sushi together it's really nice
[7350.14 --> 7355.98]  are you both sitting on the set are you in my spot absolutely not no sir i have a i have a backup
[7355.98 --> 7361.26]  technical difficulties linus sitting in your spot i think he has a better i think he probably has a better
[7361.26 --> 7368.46]  spot than me anyway yeah probably his desk like actually fits legs under it so my my spot is really
[7368.46 --> 7372.86]  uncomfortable i was i was mostly making a big bang theory reference people are allowed to sit in my
[7372.86 --> 7377.34]  chair i feel like i have to explain that because oh god a number of people that take what i say
[7377.34 --> 7384.06]  seriously and then i yeah i pick up uh i pick it up too um i'm also not serious yeah i sit in his chair
[7384.06 --> 7389.26]  all the time maybe wait you do don't look at me like that dan we've talked about the whole company
[7389.26 --> 7393.10]  just to make sure there's like a certain level of equality the whole company after monday morning
[7393.10 --> 7397.82]  meeting actually at one by one make sure that everyone sits in linus's chair for at least 15
[7397.82 --> 7405.42]  seconds you're not you're not in on monday yeah yeah what are we doing where am i oh yeah merch messages
[7405.42 --> 7410.54]  all right so we got three to go yeah hit me your thoughts uh you once had a video on object
[7410.54 --> 7417.02]  recognition in surveillance systems using ai neural network asics do you see dedicated ai chips being
[7417.02 --> 7425.66]  all over devices in the next decade absolutely 100 i mean we're already seeing it until oh in fact i
[7425.66 --> 7433.42]  think one of the topics in the doc is in or no rather a topic we decided not to talk about but is pretty
[7433.42 --> 7442.94]  cool anyway i guess uh is that intel showed off stable diffusion running on their um their new ai
[7442.94 --> 7451.66]  accelerated meteor lake chip and that's it's like what luke said about how like private uh you know
[7451.66 --> 7459.10]  private um machine learning models are going to be really important going forward so being able to just
[7459.10 --> 7465.18]  like generate an image i mean you might not even would you would you still need a an internet
[7465.18 --> 7473.98]  connection maybe maybe not wait for what to just to just generate uh an image as long yeah i mean as
[7473.98 --> 7482.14]  long as you have enough storage for the model yeah right yeah so huh i mean they'll probably make you go
[7482.14 --> 7486.06]  through the cloud anyway well and you can you could retrain so like you could looking at you google
[7486.06 --> 7491.42]  freaking voice assistant anyway sorry no but like stable diffusion itself you can download run it
[7491.42 --> 7497.82]  offline entirely oh i've never tried i didn't know that okay yeah cool so yeah being able to do that
[7497.82 --> 7503.02]  faster i mean yeah we're gonna see that in your laptop and we've been seeing we've been seeing um
[7503.66 --> 7508.38]  like machine learning course built into phones for quite some time doing everything from you know
[7508.38 --> 7515.98]  trying to optimize your battery life to uh optimizing your your photography right like yes ai chips
[7515.98 --> 7521.34]  in all the things whether you like it or not oh yeah it's absolutely a big thing a little bit
[7521.34 --> 7532.06]  different here how did the short circuit channel get its name i want to say james is the one who came
[7532.06 --> 7538.46]  up with it because i think i talked about this once in the past and i thought it was me or something and
[7538.46 --> 7547.42]  then i think he corrected me but i could have this memory completely wrong and gmail search is useless
[7547.42 --> 7552.46]  now oh yeah there's no way you're gonna find it so if i were to try to find just the first reference to
[7553.18 --> 7563.18]  short circuit in my inbox um that might just be impossible oh good john used to have short circuit in his
[7563.18 --> 7571.58]  stupid email signature so i have every email i ever got from john oh here perfect um
[7573.42 --> 7579.58]  i don't think you're gonna find it i mean isn't it kind of worth a shot to see the the conversation
[7579.58 --> 7583.26]  that we had around it here we go top names for new channel oh
[7583.26 --> 7597.18]  wait whoa so the name came was riley so this is when we were okay okay this is fun uh top names for
[7597.18 --> 7603.34]  new channel is the subject line from mr nick light february 2018. technical because apparently we might
[7603.34 --> 7610.86]  end up using these in the future ah we're not gonna use any of these okay um tech linked or clinked pronounced
[7610.86 --> 7616.54]  clinked so it's like an abbreviated ch like tech linked uh we didn't end up with clinked because
[7616.54 --> 7624.30]  that was dumb um tech brief brief tech brink of tech tech point uh it's kind of like a tip um
[7625.10 --> 7631.18]  best and latest in tech blt we have always liked the acronyms quickie news quickie news ah that
[7631.18 --> 7639.82]  cookie news held on for a little while yeah i remember that um the cash and then i i reply i actually like
[7639.82 --> 7644.86]  tech linked best out of them adding riley for his thoughts uh the three that i kind of liked were
[7644.86 --> 7652.86]  tech linked tech point and quickie news and then let's see riley pitched in with i gotta say i find
[7652.86 --> 7657.98]  myself gravitating toward tech linked as well we were trying not to do tech linked because it's just
[7657.98 --> 7662.22]  it's so close to netlinked well but that was why yeah no like that we're just like
[7663.98 --> 7666.38]  what if instead of netlinked it was just techlink
[7666.38 --> 7675.50]  anyway like we even though it was my suggestion i was also kind of trying not to do it this one's
[7675.50 --> 7680.22]  pretty good i wouldn't say that so riley pitches in he goes yeah i find myself gravitating towards
[7680.22 --> 7684.30]  it as well but i feel like there's so many shows and sites that have tech in the name so i'd be
[7684.30 --> 7689.98]  less inclined to want that i've got a couple more to throw in the pot and one of them is a really good
[7689.98 --> 7695.34]  idea that we might use someday so we're not going to say that one but he goes what about short circuit
[7695.98 --> 7699.58]  that is the first reference to short circuit
[7701.90 --> 7709.58]  so i think it must have been riley we had some discussion um short circuit lost because of the
[7709.58 --> 7719.26]  movie dot dot dot problem uh kind of sounds like inside track which you know is good but the movie
[7719.26 --> 7725.66]  problems there's a movie called short circuit uh so we made our name ultimately when we launched
[7725.66 --> 7732.06]  short circuit totally different by making it one word got him searchability let's go yeah
[7733.98 --> 7743.26]  yeah that's that's wild i i i did not know that it was riley but it appears that it was totally riley
[7743.26 --> 7750.06]  whether we realize it or not is it is it possible oh okay hold on short circuit branding discussion
[7750.06 --> 7760.22]  what is this uh this is a doc uh meeting notes this is amazing i i love just like poking around
[7760.22 --> 7765.58]  at this old stuff our objective for this meeting attendance nick john o james and linus objective
[7765.58 --> 7770.14]  establish a baseline for the new channel's logo and branding direction meeting notes should the
[7770.14 --> 7776.94]  name be one word or two um minus wants it wants it one word name and he likes it this this is someone
[7776.94 --> 7782.38]  else's notes nick it should be in all caps if it's one word linus wants one word big s big c
[7782.38 --> 7790.78]  yes i won that executive flex short circuit big s big c uh the reason i care about that i was i wasn't
[7790.78 --> 7796.46]  just trying to be a jerk about it and just be like no this way um because i like being able to
[7796.46 --> 7803.58]  abbreviate things sc is easier when you like clearly see the sc next step color than graphics
[7803.58 --> 7811.18]  colors pink and yellow says linus baby blue and pink says nick linus wants eye searing nick says yellow
[7811.18 --> 7816.46]  is very aggressive and if you're looking at it on a screen it can be offensive linus wants to see
[7816.46 --> 7820.14]  options yellow and pink baby blue and pink what did we ultimately end up with
[7820.14 --> 7821.10]  blue and pink i think so
[7825.02 --> 7833.42]  or baby blue pink orange and purple and white so that's yellow and yellow they're all in there
[7833.42 --> 7841.26]  every color no green no red no navy um and yeah i think i think none of those ended up making it 80s
[7841.26 --> 7847.98]  styling digital branding both of those kind of stayed yeah oh this is so cool how did how did things come
[7847.98 --> 7853.50]  to be there you go now these are the kinds of meetings that we have that i never want to have
[7853.50 --> 7862.06]  again like i shouldn't even say that because i do i do enjoy the creative process you like some of that
[7862.06 --> 7866.86]  stuff and that actually does fall under vision officer sir so good luck with that i just i can't do all
[7866.86 --> 7871.82]  of it that's the thing i can't be in every one of these meetings anymore yeah like it's exhausting
[7871.82 --> 7878.54]  i'd rather be on the camera on short circuit all right dan hit me sure thing but that's where you
[7878.54 --> 7882.30]  have like channel managers like sorry one second that's where you have like channel managers because
[7882.30 --> 7889.50]  like riley is working on game linked right yep so like he's the channel manager for linked in general
[7889.50 --> 7895.98]  as far as my understanding goes so like i'm sure he has more play into the that type of like were you
[7895.98 --> 7903.02]  involved in the picking of the primary colors for game linked no yeah so we've moved on i actually first
[7903.02 --> 7909.26]  saw the logo live on wanshow and i was like oh there's a channel for it yeah by the way uh it's driving
[7909.26 --> 7916.14]  riley crazy how much i keep talking about game linked on wanshow because dang it linus it's not ready for
[7916.14 --> 7922.38]  launch yet um so if you wanna if you wanna bother him go subscribe to game linked yeah because the
[7922.38 --> 7930.62]  more subscribers are on it the more he's like oh linus can you keep talking about game linked i wanted
[7930.62 --> 7936.94]  to do a big a big surprise launch the surprise is over so you might as well get subscribed so that at
[7936.94 --> 7941.90]  least he can launch the first video and it can get a ton of views because you guys will all get a
[7941.90 --> 7945.66]  notification yeah and you can watch it and it's gonna be awesome because it's gonna be tech linked but
[7945.66 --> 7953.34]  games and you guys are gonna love it oh right the pool okay dan don't let me forget to talk about
[7953.34 --> 7960.06]  that after this one more merch message okay hey lld i love to see luke back on camera and the two of
[7960.06 --> 7966.30]  you work uh you two of you really work well together uh what were some challenges with luke returning and
[7966.30 --> 7974.22]  will we see more of him perhaps a short circuit it was really hard to walk from the wanset over
[7975.26 --> 7980.78]  that was very tough especially because you were waiting for when to start anyway when we did that pc
[7980.78 --> 7987.02]  cleaning products video yep i mean if we're gonna be late for when we might as well both be late for when
[7987.02 --> 7995.02]  yeah um yeah i don't know what were the challenges with with you returning i genuinely don't know i
[7995.02 --> 8001.34]  think the biggest challenge with bringing luke back on camera is that compared to when he used to be on
[8001.34 --> 8008.70]  camera he has a lot of work to do now oh yeah like i don't have the time to do it consistently there's no way
[8008.70 --> 8015.58]  yeah i'm excited about game linked because the prospect of being able to just like and and tech
[8015.58 --> 8018.70]  linked and stuff like that where i can just show up on set do it really quickly and then leave and
[8018.70 --> 8023.50]  go back to what i'm doing is like a lot more feasible than even go through the whole process
[8023.50 --> 8028.70]  for like an ltd video or something and that kind of worked in in this scenario that we're talking about
[8028.70 --> 8034.14]  with the with the cleaning products video because like you said i was just waiting for when anyways so
[8034.14 --> 8040.06]  my my work was pretty ineffective so it was like i can wait over there and like clean some stuff
[8040.78 --> 8045.34]  so it just worked i don't know but yeah i got a lot of stuff to do i don't i can't do videos all the
[8045.34 --> 8055.66]  time i enjoy it it's fun but yeah all right cool so the pool company we contracted is grn pool and landscape
[8056.62 --> 8068.22]  and it has been two years we checked it has actually been two years since we got the original
[8069.34 --> 8076.22]  like documentation and sent a deposit to begin work on our project um
[8076.22 --> 8087.98]  um at the time they had pretty good reviews and uh seemed very knowledgeable and professional uh
[8087.98 --> 8093.98]  things were moving along quite quickly when it came to you know selecting materials and and design and and
[8093.98 --> 8100.62]  all that kind of stuff and we actually ended up starting with pool and awarding them landscaping stuff
[8100.62 --> 8113.26]  as well which now we're not doing with them anymore did they do any of that yeah yeah so all the stuff that changed in like the outside so far has been them
[8113.90 --> 8122.94]  so they they do work and this is one of those cases where i i want to i want to give mad props to the on-site workers
[8122.94 --> 8132.62]  like all the guys that i've had the pleasure of interacting with have been just solid um and they they seem to care they seem to try
[8133.26 --> 8139.66]  but i think they really you know this is my own speculation i think they really struggle with communication
[8140.54 --> 8145.10]  and so when they do make mistakes a lot of the time it's because they just
[8145.10 --> 8159.90]  they just didn't know so this company has screwed up or just not shown up so many things um and some of it's just like
[8160.54 --> 8173.34]  you know oh that could have easily been a misunderstanding um like for example the all the tiles um this could have been a communication issue i don't know but they were all supposed to go one way
[8173.34 --> 8181.34]  and instead it goes one way down the sides and it goes this way down there so it looks stupid it's a little weird uh they used a different color of grout
[8181.34 --> 8187.50]  for like the sandy grout around the pool and the ones on the deck and it's like these are obviously like first world problems
[8188.06 --> 8201.42]  um but they oh my god uh oh oh yeah this was uh this was this was a this was a really good one um our interior contractor who's a totally different contractor
[8201.42 --> 8207.82]  we're really happy with those guys might as well shut them out too shermar um like showed up and was like
[8207.82 --> 8213.42]  hey i couldn't help noticing they were digging really close to the house and they've done nothing to support
[8213.42 --> 8223.82]  these these footings for the upper balcony um yeah that can't be like that um and they you know had to help us get that fixed
[8223.82 --> 8236.94]  um basically like put these braces on it um the the the really the really bad part the worst part has been the communication though just yeah we're coming this day and then they just don't show up and then we go hey where the heck were you and like
[8236.94 --> 8247.82]  uh we're coming this other day yeah but that didn't answer my question where where were you and looking at google reviews it looks like this has this has become if it wasn't always
[8247.82 --> 8254.46]  uh a problem and the way that they are conducting their business seems to me to be
[8255.98 --> 8263.74]  extremely um extremely skeezy uh where they you know they say they're gonna do things they don't do things
[8263.74 --> 8270.78]  they say they're they're taking deposits to acquire materials those materials take an extremely long time to show up
[8271.50 --> 8278.70]  um you just and it's no it's just endless you know we you know how uh we're neighbors with coverstar
[8279.98 --> 8285.58]  yeah so when we were talking about pool covers we were like oh hey we're neighbors with coverstar
[8285.58 --> 8289.74]  why don't we go swing by and ask them if they want to do a neighborly discount or if there's anything
[8289.74 --> 8294.22]  that we can we can do with them because we're like literally almost next door neighbors you never know
[8294.22 --> 8299.98]  right like it never hurts to ask if you ask for the friends and neighbors discount as one of the local
[8299.98 --> 8306.62]  uh paint chains they will literally just apply a discount to your order um like it never hurts
[8306.62 --> 8311.26]  to ask and they're like oh yeah well we used to use coverstar a lot but these other ones are better
[8311.26 --> 8317.18]  and then all these like 18 months later or whatever they're like hey yeah we're getting the sizing done
[8317.18 --> 8322.70]  coverstar is coming out to measure it and i'm like which is fine i had no problem using coverstar
[8322.70 --> 8326.38]  but you could have just told me that and then i could have asked them if we can get a friends and
[8326.38 --> 8333.58]  neighbors discount yeah um and like you know in in a very early version of the statement of work
[8333.58 --> 8338.38]  it's very clear that we wanted in wall stairs uh because i really like in wall stairs i don't like
[8338.38 --> 8344.86]  the ladder hanging in yes like harder to clean pain in the butt um and like it feels way more stable
[8344.86 --> 8351.50]  yeah i just i just wanted in wall stairs and so you know they sent us a bill for first of all we
[8351.50 --> 8355.42]  noticed they weren't there and then we're like hey they're not there and they sent us a bill for what
[8355.42 --> 8358.62]  it would cost to add in wall stairs and we send them the thing that's like hey this says in wall
[8358.62 --> 8365.02]  stairs and it's been a year and a half so there was some verbal communication in addition to it just
[8365.02 --> 8370.94]  being written on the thing and so it's not actually legally binding that they were definitely doing it
[8370.94 --> 8375.50]  but then there's one other google review where the person also says they asked for in wall stairs
[8375.50 --> 8381.18]  and then we're billed for it later um so maybe this is just a play i don't know um
[8381.18 --> 8384.86]  um but long story short
[8387.42 --> 8391.98]  the challenges are and you're probably asking like you think you guys would have learned you know why
[8391.98 --> 8398.46]  do you keep working with them and there's not a lot of pool contractors in the vancouver area
[8398.46 --> 8404.14]  and particularly for concrete pools there are even fewer so you're you're sort of at the mercy they
[8404.14 --> 8409.34]  they take deposits which um you know yeah you're right maybe we should have stopped giving them deposits but
[8410.06 --> 8415.34]  we always kept being told yeah no we're gonna we're gonna you know we're gonna get it you know
[8415.34 --> 8419.74]  we're gonna get it done soon we're so close we're so close we are actually extremely close right now
[8420.38 --> 8426.86]  all they have to do the slabs already outside all they have to do is put the pool equipment on the slab
[8426.86 --> 8438.54]  and cut in the stupid in wall stairs that i asked for um and do the uh install the cover and then put on the
[8439.90 --> 8443.98]  whatever the material they put over the concrete on the on the inside of the pool is i forget what
[8443.98 --> 8449.18]  it's called it's like some plaster or something something like that uh and it's like a couple weeks
[8449.18 --> 8453.26]  of work and we've been sitting here with a couple weeks of work left in the project since like march or
[8453.26 --> 8458.70]  something like that and it's it's like constantly like this with these guys they finally acknowledge
[8458.70 --> 8463.42]  now so this is i guess an improvement since we gave them an ultimatum we were like hey you guys need to
[8463.42 --> 8467.42]  show up and start working continuously starting on this day or we're going public with this like it's
[8467.42 --> 8475.66]  not the kind of thing we like to do but i this is ridiculous and you you basically um yeah yeah you
[8475.66 --> 8482.78]  earned it um so they finally admitted to us that yes they're pulling people off our job and putting
[8482.78 --> 8490.78]  them on other jobs and we're sitting here going no um our project has been pending for two years
[8490.78 --> 8497.18]  yeah this is the second summer it's gonna miss and the delays have been from you guys not from us these
[8497.18 --> 8503.18]  were not our fault we've always we've always paid promptly as promptly as we can given that yvonne finds
[8503.18 --> 8509.58]  all kinds of building irregularities because she's devon um and so it takes a ton of time it has it
[8509.58 --> 8515.42]  has taken an inordinate amount of time for her because there'd be no communication from hq so she
[8515.42 --> 8518.86]  would have to go out every morning and tell that she basically had to project manage it when they were
[8518.86 --> 8523.90]  doing the landscaping because nobody told anybody anything so they ended up doing all kinds of dumb
[8523.90 --> 8529.98]  stuff like digging up a trench in the wrongs or like they they dug up this uh drain thing that they
[8529.98 --> 8534.54]  ultimately had then covered and then had to like dig again retrench it and then put a new one in
[8534.54 --> 8543.34]  because they just like didn't have a drain anymore um allegedly yeah so i'm i'm extremely frustrated and
[8543.34 --> 8550.54]  that's why we haven't been able to do whole room water cooling for the server room because um even though
[8551.90 --> 8556.54]  shurmar's plumbing guys did a great job of putting in all the all the piping and everything that we
[8556.54 --> 8563.02]  needed before the concrete did finally or the shotcrete did ultimately get put in um there's
[8563.02 --> 8571.58]  nothing there's no pool to act as a thermal mass so you know again i want to be very clear this is a
[8571.58 --> 8578.54]  first world problem i get it but also when you pay for something you should probably and you shake hands
[8578.54 --> 8583.42]  and you have an agreement then you should probably get that thing is it is there like special liabilities
[8583.42 --> 8588.54]  with making pools or something like is there some reason why you couldn't get a general contractor
[8588.54 --> 8594.22]  yeah it's just it's a really specialized type of work and uh we did find another pool contractor
[8594.22 --> 8599.74]  that's willing to take over the job which is part of why i'm able to talk about this because like at
[8599.74 --> 8604.86]  i was like at their mercy basically they had my money and unless i want to take them to court which i
[8604.86 --> 8613.18]  don't think i'm the only person doing at this point um either i play ball and get a pool or i
[8613.18 --> 8616.70]  antagonize them and they just pull everybody off my job and work on something else because they
[8616.70 --> 8623.26]  clearly have other work to do right so i'm just sort of sitting here stuck um sorry what was your
[8623.26 --> 8628.46]  question again though uh no i just i don't know oh yeah searching contractors yeah yeah we found another
[8628.46 --> 8635.82]  one that's willing to finish the job so that's great but the referral we got for these guys was
[8635.82 --> 8641.26]  from like another mom at the school and she was like yeah it took six months and it was pulling teeth
[8641.26 --> 8649.02]  but they did get it done so it's not a perfect reference and they won't even look at it let alone quote
[8649.02 --> 8656.22]  it until we have formally dismissed grn from the job oh wow which is you know going back to luring you
[8656.22 --> 8661.34]  into the computex booth to get you to cover something different yeah a classic contractor
[8661.34 --> 8669.02]  move yeah that's brutal um because yeah if their quote sucks then you know obviously i don't want to
[8669.98 --> 8675.58]  go with them would you consider if they charged you to come out and quote it um that'd be better
[8675.58 --> 8680.30]  they just charge you like an hourly rate just like no no no but i'm saying like sure yeah because i
[8680.30 --> 8683.90]  could i could understand like them being like yeah i don't want to just
[8683.90 --> 8690.06]  help you like negotiate a better rate for somebody else yeah yeah yeah
[8691.90 --> 8697.26]  rough well at least i now know that there won't be swimming at linus's place this summer
[8697.98 --> 8703.42]  yeah i've given up we were supposed to be swimming before the end of last summer yeah and i don't think
[8703.42 --> 8709.82]  we're going to swim in 2023 yeah if you're searching contractors and stuff like nobody yeah i really don't see it
[8709.82 --> 8715.90]  happening there isn't that much to do there's like two weeks of work left to do luke theoretically i
[8715.90 --> 8719.74]  should be swimming in mid-june i wouldn't be surprised though because if this new contractor
[8719.74 --> 8723.90]  comes in they might have liability concerns about the previously existing we're gonna have to go and
[8723.90 --> 8730.94]  check a whole bunch of stuff which i'm sure i'm gonna pay for yep i'm really frustrated yeah like it's
[8730.94 --> 8739.58]  gonna be rough okay are there other topics ltx 2023 update we are under two months away from ltx 2023 we
[8739.58 --> 8746.94]  have sold over 3 500 tickets so far there are an insane amount of creators actually just naming them

[8910.46 --> 8919.26]  dr ian cuttress uh toasty bros ufd tech stacy roy uh terren's apparently coming terren van hemer is on
[8919.26 --> 8924.46]  the list that's funny uh i didn't negotiate all of these necessarily so some of these i'm finding

[9009.18 --> 9018.46]  i'm lost without our cue cards i feel like yeah i forgot to mail them to you uh well let's see we
[9018.46 --> 9024.06]  technically have another 10 minutes until when after dark uh but we do have a hell of a lot of merch
[9024.06 --> 9032.54]  messages uh so when in the morning really i'm surprised there's that many merch messages we uh there's a lot
[9032.54 --> 9044.22]  of really good questions today oh there's not yeah there is actually quite a few way to go luke um
[9047.42 --> 9054.70]  wow i mean it's it's been a lot worse you're basically an abuser oh my goodness oh my gosh luke
[9055.74 --> 9061.10]  the doc wasn't done when we were looking at this there's like huge stuff in here that we haven't
[9061.10 --> 9069.02]  talked about yet um thanks riley adding all this stuff that we absolutely have to talk about okay
[9069.02 --> 9076.54]  where are we at where are we at where are we at diablo 4 developers do a q a with fake oh slash softball
[9076.54 --> 9083.58]  fan questions this is extremely not surprising this is amazing yeah okay games radar's future games show
[9083.58 --> 9089.90]  interviewed the art director and associate game director of diablo 4 asking fan questions like the
[9089.90 --> 9096.86]  cut scenes in d4 are gorgeous how important was it to get these as high quality as they are in the
[9096.86 --> 9103.82]  game uh twitter user phil takular looked up the social handles of the fans who submitted the questions
[9103.82 --> 9110.70]  and they were a mixture of inactive accounts made years ago or extremely recently uh when okay to be fair
[9112.94 --> 9118.06]  that might be fine yeah it might be people that just have throwaway twitter accounts yeah because but
[9118.06 --> 9123.50]  also it wouldn't have been all of them uh for sure yeah yeah uh when asked for comment blizzard said
[9123.50 --> 9129.50]  they were not involved in the process of gathering questions after much discourse the future game show
[9129.50 --> 9136.54]  posted an update via a comment on the original interview saying we messed up in quotes basically
[9136.54 --> 9142.14]  they claim many of the questions were legit but the social handles were randomly generated to protect the
[9142.14 --> 9151.18]  original what originally used randomly generated but they landed on actual handles cool what i'm sure
[9151.18 --> 9161.34]  that's against at least someone's terms of service that's weird um okay uh moving on that we we got to
[9161.34 --> 9166.14]  talk about this one because it was actually called out at the beginning dolphin steam launch postponed the
[9166.14 --> 9172.06]  dolphin emulator team has announced that its planned steam release has been indefinitely postponed
[9172.06 --> 9178.14]  following a letter written from nintendo to valve citing the digital millennium copyright act or dmca
[9178.62 --> 9184.70]  uh which is kind of rough making matters worse valve confirmed that they reached out to nintendo
[9184.70 --> 9190.70]  first presumably because they knew that as a platform hosting dolphin valve would be that makes matters
[9190.70 --> 9194.86]  worse that's just not surprising at all uh valve would be in the crosshairs of nintendo's lawyers
[9194.86 --> 9199.90]  obviously yeah that makes sense that they would have done that um as dolphin had not been released
[9199.90 --> 9205.98]  on steam the letter is more of a shot across the bow warning valve that the emulator's release would
[9205.98 --> 9216.14]  violate the dmca would it though okay well here sure this is this is i guess the argument uh dolphin's code
[9216.14 --> 9222.94]  contains the wii common key yeah that sounds like a nintendo's proprietary code for decrypting wii games which
[9222.94 --> 9228.14]  is a 39 digit number that is well known so i won't paste it here says our writer
[9230.86 --> 9234.46]  but having that in the thing like that does actually make sense as to something that you
[9234.46 --> 9240.54]  could go after even it is if it is commonly known or whatever some other emulators require the game
[9240.54 --> 9248.06]  files to host such keys instead which is arguably legally safer um not that we know anything
[9248.06 --> 9254.14]  allegedly this is not legal advice etc etc etc several law lawyers have confirmed to ars technica that
[9254.14 --> 9259.98]  nintendo could have a strong case should it come to a lawsuit because the inclusion of that key yeah
[9259.98 --> 9266.22]  exactly yeah a spokesperson for nintendo said using illegal emulators or illegal copies of games harms
[9266.22 --> 9272.14]  development and ultimately stifles innovation discussion question nintendo being an
[9272.14 --> 9277.26]  an asshole is one thing but is there anything else valve could have done other than poke the bear i
[9277.26 --> 9283.98]  don't think so no i mean they were going to be valve is no stranger to lawsuits you know at their scale
[9283.98 --> 9289.90]  it just happened i mean we we talked about this recently what was it the uh the haptic or the rumble
[9289.90 --> 9295.42]  on the steam deck or something like that has some patent troll coming after them right now yeah um
[9295.42 --> 9303.34]  i as much as i have pointed at valves in the past and been not happy uh this was very reasonable of
[9303.34 --> 9311.98]  them to do yeah as for whether using emulators which by the way are not illegal nintendo yeah um as for
[9311.98 --> 9319.42]  whether that ultimately stifles innovation i i would say that playing tears of the kingdom at 4k 60 fps with
[9320.06 --> 9329.42]  improved visual fidelity is innovation and your crappy hardware stifles innovation um this can go both
[9329.42 --> 9340.54]  ways boom got him yeah got him um speaking of stifling innovation did you see the reddit api pricing
[9340.54 --> 9347.42]  conversation yeah by the way can i help you with this what the hell man do you not even do this bro oh i
[9347.42 --> 9352.46]  actually like the separation oh it helps my brain all right well i'm sorry i broke your brain then
[9352.46 --> 9361.66]  no it's fine not the first time yeah um christian selig the developer of the popular apollo ios app for
[9361.66 --> 9372.62]  reddit says that reddit wants 12 000 per 50 million requests and this is a quote here apollo made 7 billion
[9372.62 --> 9379.74]  requests last month which would put it at about 1.7 million dollars a month the average apollo user
[9379.74 --> 9388.78]  uses 344 requests per day wow which would cost 2.50 a month that means even with only subscription
[9388.78 --> 9396.70]  users the app would be unable to break even imgur apparently charges apollo 166 dollars for the same
[9396.70 --> 9405.90]  number of requests that is literally almost an order of no oh wow almost two orders of magnitude less
[9406.86 --> 9414.14]  twitter of course kicked off the trend of expensive api access to social platforms with its lowest tier
[9414.14 --> 9420.78]  offering only 10 000 requests for a hundred dollars twitter has subsequently been abandoned as a data
[9420.78 --> 9427.90]  source by many academics and the future of many long-term projects is unclear such as bodo which
[9427.90 --> 9435.50]  assesses how likely an account is to be a bot and whose work was actually cited in elon musk's fight to not
[9435.50 --> 9447.18]  buy twitter um yeah this sucks people are asking who would pay that for reddit's api though i think that's
[9447.18 --> 9454.70]  i think that's the point the point is that these platforms are getting scraped by ai companies and
[9454.70 --> 9460.78]  not getting any of the money that is getting dumped into ai right now and they're sitting there going
[9461.66 --> 9470.46]  well if we kill a bunch of research projects and we kill a bunch of uh community favorite third-party
[9470.46 --> 9477.10]  apps in the process i guess that's totally worth it because we'll definitely still be popular
[9477.10 --> 9481.74]  platforms that will definitely still be valuable for these ai companies to scrape and we're not
[9481.74 --> 9483.66]  going to throw the baby out with the bath water
[9486.62 --> 9494.46]  yeah i don't i don't know what's going to happen in that regard uh but it's not surprising at all to me
[9495.74 --> 9500.70]  it sucks yeah um there's a there's a fair bit more information that i've been reading about this
[9500.70 --> 9506.70]  that's not in our notes here necessarily but um christian the apollo developer sort of
[9506.70 --> 9515.34]  broke down um from from reddit's public financial statements how much each of those calls has to
[9515.34 --> 9525.58]  cost them and basically they're they're so far beyond just you know well you know the reddit app
[9525.58 --> 9530.06]  has ads that help support us and we're not getting that from your third-party app and we need to find a
[9530.06 --> 9536.22]  way to make this you know sustainable like like they're so far beyond just we need to be sustainable this
[9536.22 --> 9541.02]  is just a blatant cash grab yeah according to his math someone in the flow clean chat said the google
[9541.02 --> 9547.98]  maps api is less than 900 for 500 000 calls for comparison yeah i i said this with the twitter one
[9547.98 --> 9553.82]  too the goal here is not to make it affordable or for to make it make sense the goal here is to crush
[9553.82 --> 9563.02]  third-party apps yeah like yeah and given how unpopular the first party reddit app is um
[9565.10 --> 9573.66]  i gotta wonder what this means for reddit like will no one's safe where's slash dot today where's dig
[9574.46 --> 9580.22]  i do agree with that but i feel like we've been in a actually surprisingly long period of internet
[9580.22 --> 9584.86]  stagnation now yeah but it's like that article i sent you before the in certification of everything
[9584.86 --> 9591.10]  yeah and i think the reason that everything is coming to a head right now is because we also went
[9591.10 --> 9603.26]  through a period of basically unrestricted money hose flowing into technology into into web however many
[9603.26 --> 9610.62]  point o companies right yeah and so now that that now that that spigot is getting turned off and it's
[9610.62 --> 9617.82]  all going into ai or it's going into uh you know finding new ways to make housing unaffordable for regular
[9617.82 --> 9626.54]  people good um i think we're seeing these companies pivot to hey we we just need to like make money to
[9626.54 --> 9631.90]  please our shareholders right we we can't just be in this in this growth phase we can't be in a pleasing the
[9631.90 --> 9637.02]  the user phase anymore and even if if because i know some people are going to sniff at that and
[9637.02 --> 9641.42]  be like oh yeah but no companies are going to pay this api fee that might be true i don't think they're
[9641.42 --> 9648.70]  necessarily expecting to make money off of this but i do think a significant effort is being put to
[9650.06 --> 9655.34]  hamper how much other people are able to make money off of your stuff yeah yeah just just putting up
[9655.34 --> 9660.70]  walls like no if if someone is using twitter we want them using twitter through our own means
[9660.70 --> 9672.70]  etc yeah yeah someone in full plane chat run john said my reddit account is 15 years old i'll be
[9672.70 --> 9676.94]  leaving once they kill third-party apps uh to be completely honest that'll probably be good for you
[9676.94 --> 9683.90]  anyways hey ios says the first party reddit app makes thousands of tracking calls to the web that my
[9683.90 --> 9690.38]  pie hole went nuts blocking and blew the log files out to gigabytes um so yeah there are reasons
[9691.26 --> 9695.90]  there are reasons they want you using the first party the first party tools and they're not always
[9696.62 --> 9703.26]  user-friendly reasons oh yeah they barely are and just stop using like is your life actually enriched
[9703.26 --> 9708.14]  by using reddit maybe but probably not as much can be reddit's a really good resource for like
[9708.14 --> 9713.58]  how do i fix this problem reddit i i don't know if i'm just being cynical here maybe i am or pessimistic or
[9713.58 --> 9722.30]  whatever but i think most people doom scroll instead of gather information in that way i have found
[9723.74 --> 9728.14]  that a more effective google search for a while has been the same google search that you would normally
[9728.14 --> 9733.26]  do and then you append reddit on the end yeah that's kind of unfortunate it just shows google going
[9733.26 --> 9740.30]  down the hole to be honest but um if you use it in that way that's kind of its own thing and if you use it in
[9740.30 --> 9746.30]  that way you don't really need the app either if we're being honest oh i don't use the app yeah i
[9746.30 --> 9753.02]  i just whatever i i actually have just like a muscle memory uh like there's no way to get rid of the
[9753.02 --> 9758.62]  notification as far as i can tell on mobile when i'm just on the web because i i can't find for what
[9758.62 --> 9767.02]  i do on reddit i can't find any reason to use an app instead of just using my browser i i can't think of
[9767.02 --> 9774.94]  one all i want to do is read things from time to time and post even more occasionally um and so it
[9774.94 --> 9781.26]  prompts me like every time i load the site reddit's better in the app you want to use the app no no not
[9781.26 --> 9786.70]  really i don't even i don't it bothered me for a long time and it definitely hasn't gone away but it
[9786.70 --> 9792.14]  doesn't bother me anymore because i just no yeah no yeah no i think i'm good actually
[9792.14 --> 9800.54]  yeah someone in flow plane chat uh my husband absolutely doom scrolls he doesn't learn anything
[9800.54 --> 9806.62]  useful 99 of the time yeah i think that is the standard approach to using reddit to be completely
[9806.62 --> 9814.22]  honest like i think most people that use reddit could benefit very significantly from using it way
[9814.22 --> 9821.10]  less um but that isn't saying that reddit is useless i find it very very useful for like information
[9821.10 --> 9826.78]  um yeah a lot of times when i do that google search and i append reddit reddit is like actually the
[9826.78 --> 9831.98]  best source and i do it because i have done it without reddit at the end and found nothing useful
[9831.98 --> 9835.50]  and then done it with reddit at the end and then finding very good answers from
[9846.54 --> 9849.58]  guys i don't know if you can hear me i can't hear you at the moment
[9851.10 --> 9851.98]  you
[9856.38 --> 9861.26]  hello oh man sorry chat hold on a second
[9865.42 --> 9875.98]  tap tap tap
[9881.10 --> 9887.66]  i don't want to ad lib everything not mike angie
[9895.18 --> 9898.22]  well i guess it's just it's just me now
[9898.22 --> 9909.90]  am i i'm i'm not sure i'm sending to them either
[9911.18 --> 9911.98]  this is very strange
[9914.30 --> 9915.26]  mute unmute
[9917.26 --> 9917.58]  hmm
[9917.58 --> 9929.58]  i'm going to go ahead
[9932.22 --> 9941.18]  and restart this browser tab i hope you enjoy seeing the thing that i put up
[9941.18 --> 9953.26]  and there we go join hello are you there hello hi dan hello oh he disconnected oh i did notice there
[9953.26 --> 9957.82]  was only one person in call but i thought it maybe didn't show yourself i was showing that i was still
[9957.82 --> 9962.94]  connected i could still see your camera feed because your camera feed is fed directly from your call but
[9962.94 --> 9967.58]  i think we lost audio okay cool all right back not my fault goodbye
[9967.58 --> 9977.50]  well it's not my fault i think it might be must be luke's fault maybe we can by proxy it's luke's fault
[9978.38 --> 9982.30]  yeah i'm down oh that's true i mean poo rolls down a hill so
[9982.30 --> 9989.66]  yep up a hill who rolls up a hill that management is to blame when someone does something wrong
[9990.22 --> 9996.06]  does that mean poo rolls up the hill but me so i'm not anymore or wait it's not july 1st yet yeah
[9996.06 --> 9999.10]  good oh okay yeah it's my fault yeah it's linus's fault
[10002.46 --> 10006.78]  i want to give you guys a little update on the eating disorder helpline chat bot that we talked about
[10006.78 --> 10013.10]  previously uh they have paused their plan to switch from human staff and volunteers to a chat bot
[10013.10 --> 10018.22]  that's probably good after users found that it was easy to prompt the bot into recommending calorie
[10018.22 --> 10023.26]  restriction food avoidance and frequent weigh-ins even after the user said the doctor advised them
[10023.26 --> 10029.18]  against dieting due to their eating disorder um i mean the weight loss advice was broadly accurate
[10029.18 --> 10033.74]  but the bot lacked the ability of a human to guide the conversation and simply reflected
[10033.74 --> 10039.82]  users preoccupations back at them potentially reinforcing anorexia and bulimia um
[10042.54 --> 10048.30]  when posts about this issue drew attention online nita's communications and marketing vice president
[10048.30 --> 10053.42]  commented on at least one post calling it a flat-out lie but then the next day the chat bot was taken
[10053.42 --> 10058.78]  down uh they described the issue as a bug thanking the community members who brought this to their attention
[10058.78 --> 10063.66]  that's a bit of a pivot that's a flat-out lie thank you for bringing it to our attention
[10063.74 --> 10073.58]  i know that this wasn't an ai chat bot yeah so it's not really on topic in terms of the ai revolution
[10073.58 --> 10079.66]  that we're undergoing right now or bubble or whatever technology yeah um however it does raise some
[10079.66 --> 10091.82]  interesting questions about what it's gonna look like when someone inevitably does do this with an ai chat bot
[10091.82 --> 10097.50]  um and so i'm glad we talked about it i'm glad we have an update for you guys and i'm glad that we can
[10097.50 --> 10105.66]  move on to talk about the meta quest 3 coming this fall 4.99 have you seen pictures just in this dock
[10105.66 --> 10115.90]  actually it is 40 percent slimmer with full color pass-through higher resolution better controllers and the quest
[10115.90 --> 10126.46]  two is getting a price drop to 2.99 for 128 gigs on june 4. that's right a price drop from so wait is it
[10127.90 --> 10132.14]  tell me something okay hold on let's just let's just play a little game
[10134.38 --> 10136.06]  drop okay what about this
[10136.06 --> 10146.78]  oh oh fake what about this is that is that toss is that a drop a price toss a price we start calling
[10146.78 --> 10156.38]  like uh amazon sales price tosses yeah this is extremely loud oh sorry sorry dan sorry everyone
[10156.94 --> 10162.78]  that's okay but good but it's funny right was it was it at least funny it's pretty good okay cool so it's
[10162.78 --> 10168.22]  back down to the regular price and just in time for apple's headset on monday let's go that i am much
[10168.22 --> 10173.18]  more interested in just saying i've had some interesting debates with people about this i i
[10173.18 --> 10178.38]  had my first dinner with a billionaire i'm not going to name them but uh very very interesting person
[10178.38 --> 10187.10]  i wonder uh super smart um what you wonder yeah there's only like a set amount of was it at computex
[10187.10 --> 10195.58]  uh don't worry about it okay um anyway the point is super nice super smart shockingly engaged in like
[10196.78 --> 10200.78]  the business for someone who realistically doesn't have to anymore um
[10202.22 --> 10207.90]  and we had a really cool conversation about apple where they basically were like yeah apple's really
[10207.90 --> 10212.86]  great and i was like yeah apple's really great until you like get into their sort of hypocrisy and the
[10212.86 --> 10217.34]  way they treat their users like oh you want to update the firmware on that product you bought oh
[10217.34 --> 10225.02]  you haven't bought enough of our products oh that's too bad um and you know go borrow someone
[10225.02 --> 10230.30]  else's yeah some of their business that they are quite invested in you know i'm going to keep things
[10230.30 --> 10235.26]  very vague so that it's really difficult to pin this down uh but some of their business that they're
[10235.26 --> 10242.30]  invested in uh has it takes a very principled approach to to product development and and to
[10242.30 --> 10249.26]  billing for their customers and you know i really respect that and so um you know i i uh i felt like
[10249.26 --> 10254.06]  i wasn't just talking to someone who's like well of course apple should do that they should just make
[10254.06 --> 10260.14]  more money like it was it was really great conversation and we steered back towards apple later
[10260.14 --> 10267.18]  on in the conversation because they sort of asked me to to speculate on apple's vr headset and i kind
[10267.18 --> 10271.98]  of went look um i know that this sort of flies in the face of everything i just said about apple
[10271.98 --> 10276.06]  because i said a bunch of negative stuff but that doesn't mean that i don't acknowledge the positive
[10276.06 --> 10279.98]  that they do and that doesn't mean that i don't respect a lot of what they do and their and
[10279.98 --> 10284.86]  their technological innovation and all that and i think if anyone's going to do this i think it's apple
[10284.86 --> 10291.82]  and um i think they're gonna i think they're gonna follow a really similar playbook to the one that
[10291.82 --> 10297.90]  i recognized with the apple watch um and it wasn't the first time they'd done this but it was the first
[10297.90 --> 10304.78]  time that i was red-pilled enough to figure out what it was that they were doing do you remember what
[10304.78 --> 10314.14]  went down with red-pilled enough yeah what just just like you know reality aware enough
[10314.78 --> 10323.42]  whoa what uh i i know that it has like stupid like negative connotations or whatever but i'm i
[10323.42 --> 10327.90]  refuse to i refuse to see it that way you're going to like movie i'm going with movie reference the
[10327.90 --> 10337.90]  matrix yeah yeah so um so do you remember what they did with the apple watch they didn't they just like
[10337.90 --> 10342.94]  wait observe other people doing it wrong and then do it themselves well yeah they just standard they did
[10342.94 --> 10350.62]  that to a degree but they released the apple watch right as long as it's not the little blue pills
[10350.62 --> 10356.54]  linus what's wrong with that i mean you know things happen okay you want to please your partner right
[10357.66 --> 10361.98]  you need a little bit of help nothing wrong with that it's not life isn't about holding each other
[10361.98 --> 10370.46]  down okay sometimes it's about lifting things up um anywho um what they did with the apple watch was
[10370.46 --> 10377.90]  they released it as the apple watch and then when the next generation product came out all of a sudden
[10377.90 --> 10382.94]  it was like apple watch series one or something like that like remember the branding was kind of funny
[10382.94 --> 10391.74]  around it and what they did is they retroactively like retconned the apple watch being the apple watch
[10391.74 --> 10400.06]  and they changed the name to series zero and then like really quickly software support for it like
[10401.34 --> 10405.98]  kind of went like it wasn't getting the latest features and it got kind of new about that yeah it got
[10405.98 --> 10414.22]  kind of like b tier long-term software support and was sort of was sort of treated as was sort of
[10414.22 --> 10420.86]  treated as like a a a lesser product it kind of kind of went away and what i figured out at that time
[10420.86 --> 10431.90]  was oh this is the apple version of a dev kit they just it's like minimum viable product it's yeah that
[10431.90 --> 10439.98]  makes sense it's it's acceptable enough and um you know as long as we and and and the hardware is like
[10439.98 --> 10444.22]  underpowered it's slow and it's crappy but we're just going to kind of like support it for as long
[10444.22 --> 10448.86]  as we kind of have to and the new ones are so much better that most people probably upgrade anyway and
[10448.86 --> 10455.98]  hope they didn't buy the gold one uh and and and it just kind of quietly went away and it wasn't until
[10455.98 --> 10463.42]  later that i realized that oh apparently series zero is an unofficial name they just called it apple
[10463.42 --> 10470.78]  watch first generation and they released a series one that was an upgraded version of the original
[10470.78 --> 10475.90]  okay so there that that was the funky branding so that's why people called it the series zero because
[10475.90 --> 10482.70]  the the first one just like sucked it basically got treated like an experiment and it's not the first
[10482.70 --> 10491.82]  time they did that the ipad is actually another classic example the first generation ipad was so
[10491.82 --> 10499.58]  much worse than the sex the next generation ipad it was way slower it was fatter the battery life sucked
[10499.58 --> 10505.58]  it was so much worse that i forget what the exact numbers are but i think it ended up getting software
[10505.58 --> 10512.14]  support for something like half the amount of time compared to the ipad 2 which was back when apple had
[10512.14 --> 10520.22]  sensible product naming schemes for at least some things ipad ipad 2 simple right no anyway um and
[10520.22 --> 10527.66]  so this is this is kind of a thing they do the first generation iphone sucked it didn't even have 3g
[10527.66 --> 10535.26]  support right like it sucked it was essentially a dev kit and you could i think you could make that
[10535.26 --> 10541.58]  argument pretty solidly for all three of those products iterate off of that first one very quickly
[10541.58 --> 10546.94]  though exactly yeah that's what i'm saying so i so i was looking at this i'm looking at all the
[10549.74 --> 10559.02]  oh my yeah this is not a very good connector um so i'm looking at all of the uh the indications for the
[10559.02 --> 10564.78]  upcoming apple apple vr mixed reality whatever you want to call the upcoming apple headset and it's like yeah
[10564.78 --> 10569.90]  it's probably basically not going to do anything out of the gate and this technology is super immature
[10569.90 --> 10576.62]  and it's probably going to kind of suck and my initial like knee-jerk reaction is oh it's not very
[10576.62 --> 10583.50]  apple-like to you know it feels something that sucks but yeah i hear you now but it's actually very apple
[10583.50 --> 10590.54]  like they just also replace it really quickly exactly so they released the first generation product to the
[10590.54 --> 10598.14]  public as a dev kit but instead of charging dev kit like pricing they charge retail like pricing and
[10598.14 --> 10604.78]  no no dev kits are typically more i mean they charge like okay consumer pricing and consumers can buy it if
[10604.78 --> 10611.26]  they want to be part of the experience and live on the bleeding edge but understand that this thing is
[10611.26 --> 10616.54]  probably going to go away in terms of software support because devs are going to come up with really
[10616.54 --> 10621.34]  amazing things that you can do with the apple headset and apple's going to build new capabilities
[10621.34 --> 10627.50]  into that next headset they're going to iterate fast and you're going to get left behind and as long
[10627.50 --> 10632.06]  as it doesn't cost too much money i guess that's okay or maybe if it does cost too much money i guess
[10632.06 --> 10638.14]  that's okay too because you like giving apple your money like i don't think the iphone really got good
[10638.14 --> 10644.70]  until the iphone 4 and maybe that's partly just personal bias because that's when i bought an iphone
[10644.70 --> 10650.46]  but that was the first time i felt compelled to own one oh i think i think the iphone 3g was still a
[10650.46 --> 10657.66]  pretty massive paradigm shift that's fair it felt extremely like cheap i don't know i don't know if
[10657.66 --> 10661.58]  i would say yeah i don't know if i would say if it was good yet but it was still like
[10664.06 --> 10670.70]  that was still the big moment i think in my opinion a 3gs wasn't bad people are saying
[10670.70 --> 10680.62]  because that one was a lot faster like a lot faster um i never had any of them so i don't know
[10686.78 --> 10695.74]  it's lmg invited to wwdc no um apple and i have no longer been friends on facebook for a long time
[10695.74 --> 10703.58]  i we were never friends on facebook friendship friendship not ended with apple yeah friendship
[10703.58 --> 10711.26]  never started apple's one of those companies that um you have to play the game you have to you have to
[10711.26 --> 10716.94]  cover them the way they want to be covered and my understanding is mac address actually has a
[10716.94 --> 10724.06]  relationship with apple now but i um the second i found out about that i went cool i'm not going to be
[10724.06 --> 10732.14]  involved at all probably good which yeah is almost certainly for the best i think they need to just
[10732.14 --> 10738.86]  do their thing and uh not let me um talk to apple at all because i would almost certainly say something
[10738.86 --> 10744.14]  that's not apple friendly okay so yes but even outside of that just like the association like if
[10744.14 --> 10749.10]  they if they just treat mac address like its own encapsulated thing well they they know that mac address
[10749.10 --> 10753.90]  is under the lmg umbrella it's not a secret no for sure but um we actually we talked about that
[10753.90 --> 10761.02]  when we were starting the channel was we we had like serious internal discussions do we stealthily
[10763.10 --> 10769.50]  make this thing completely separate um knowing that that could facilitate building a relationship with
[10769.50 --> 10776.78]  apple um but could blow up in our face when people figure out later that it was part of the lmg umbrella or
[10776.78 --> 10782.22]  do we just own that it's part of lmg up front be transparent even if it costs us ever building that
[10782.22 --> 10787.90]  relationship so we just have to like buy samples and do videos later forever because we'll never get
[10787.90 --> 10793.26]  you know our reviewer relationship we'll never get our questions answered um knowing also though that
[10793.26 --> 10796.78]  the benefit will be that we can grow the channel faster there's all these pros and cons and ultimately
[10796.78 --> 10804.78]  we went with we went with transparency um i just don't like i don't like drama i just don't need it in my life and i think it's a lot easier to just be up front with me and i think it's a lot of
[10804.78 --> 10810.70]  things i think it's a lot easier to just be up front with people yeah which again like makes it that much
[10810.70 --> 10816.06]  more triggering for me when i see conspiracy theories about how i'm accepting you know under the table
[10816.06 --> 10820.62]  sponsorships from doing this from doing that net if i was doing any of that stuff like look at the kind
[10820.62 --> 10823.90]  of turnover there is in the tech industry you think someone would have talked at some point
[10824.70 --> 10833.98]  like about how much under the table money i took like whatever um i think we should hit up merch messages
[10833.98 --> 10837.26]  let's set up some merch messages we're at over three hours for the runtime what
[10839.10 --> 10842.62]  yeah i i said you had 10 minutes left and then you did like 14 more topics
[10846.06 --> 10851.98]  uh oh want to go to lunch with dr cutras after when uh if i can bring wendell yeah sure because i was
[10851.98 --> 10856.94]  planning on going with wendell but meeting up with dr cutras would be fantastic i haven't seen him this
[10856.94 --> 10864.14]  whole show yeah let's go sweet um man now i'm looking forward to lunch yeah me too okay we're
[10864.14 --> 10869.18]  gonna do these merch messages pretty fast here uh okay hey andy should we should we turn off the light
[10869.74 --> 10874.14]  are we turning off the light merch messages after dark i mean let's see how much of an effect it has i
[10874.14 --> 10883.34]  kind of feel like not much i could just take down the grade um that's probably too dark does that have
[10883.34 --> 10895.02]  a does that have a uh fade on it at all what is it like oh oh oh don't step into that light
[10895.02 --> 10901.74]  that's how you know you're dead um sure yeah we'll call that when show after dark
[10902.78 --> 10909.10]  when show after dim yeah it's noon it's pretty late all right it's in the afternoon now um okay
[10909.10 --> 10915.34]  let's get into it morning merch messages morning merch messages good morning merch messages hi peeps
[10915.34 --> 10921.90]  in retrospect to reviews like the ally one that come out way before the actual release date would it
[10921.90 --> 10928.14]  be fair to make the review closer to the release date as things may change that's a really good
[10928.14 --> 10934.30]  question and i think this is pro was probably prompted by dave 2d's video on the ally um where
[10934.30 --> 10941.98]  the title uh was basically don't trust other reviews of the rog ally um and kind of talks about uh covering
[10941.98 --> 10950.94]  the product uh later and i um you know i like dave i've i've met dave before
[10951.66 --> 10957.74]  uh and honestly there's no real way for me to sugarcoat this though i think that's a shockingly
[10957.74 --> 10968.38]  bad take you you you you cover a product when the manufacturer says it's done and to to not cover
[10968.38 --> 10975.74]  it at that point like you can make your decision to to to not cover it because you think it's not in a
[10975.74 --> 10984.70]  good enough state or whatever else uh but at the end of the day to say that another media publication
[10985.42 --> 10997.90]  did anything wrong um or that or that readers and viewers shouldn't trust another review because it was
[10997.90 --> 11006.14]  it was done at an earlier stage in the product's lifetime is sort of puzzling to me um like i i think
[11006.14 --> 11014.22]  there is an absolute benefit to covering products over their lifespan uh so i don't i don't disagree with
[11014.22 --> 11021.26]  that i think that's really good but at the end of the day we can only cover what we're given and when
[11021.26 --> 11030.22]  the manufacturer says hey this is this is prime time we're not in a position to say no we disagree
[11030.22 --> 11039.74]  that it's prime time uh we're gonna cover it when it's like more prime timer um our job is to say you
[11039.74 --> 11046.54]  know hey this is the day that pre-orders are going up and this is the state of this product because asus
[11046.54 --> 11053.02]  might fix it more or they might not and if they don't you need to understand exactly what it is
[11053.02 --> 11059.58]  you're buying they said it was done and so if they think it's done then as far as i'm concerned
[11059.58 --> 11068.62]  they could stop development tomorrow they probably won't um but they could and so you have to you have
[11068.62 --> 11077.82]  to cover things as they are um rather rather than covering them as they will be you can acknowledge
[11078.46 --> 11086.78]  what they might be uh you can talk about what the brand says they might do but no you've gotta
[11088.30 --> 11088.94]  yeah you gotta
[11098.62 --> 11109.74]  uh next up uh i forget what the actual question was why don't you review it closer to the least date
[11109.74 --> 11117.42]  yeah yeah no uh no we we we should review it when asus asks for pre-order money they're asking for
[11117.42 --> 11123.66]  your money as far as i'm concerned the second a brand is asking for your money we need to take a close
[11123.66 --> 11129.66]  look at exactly what you're getting for it and then if that changes over time hey that's great
[11129.66 --> 11134.78]  i mean valve's done a great job of that with the steam deck but we can't take it for granted and if
[11134.78 --> 11141.18]  other publications cover it closer to the availability date a month after the availability
[11141.18 --> 11146.22]  date six months after the availability date i hope check them out yeah check it out we had this
[11146.22 --> 11150.38]  conversation earlier in the show we don't all have to say the same thing you don't like yes it's not
[11150.38 --> 11157.26]  of particular benefit to you for like every single reviewer to release identical videos all at the
[11157.26 --> 11165.90]  exact same minute like just whatever yes game linked is real lakeways and float plane chat go subscribe
[11168.70 --> 11174.54]  okay up next is from david what is the most interesting thing you saw at computex that you
[11174.54 --> 11176.14]  thought wouldn't make a good video
[11180.38 --> 11187.34]  oh that's a really good question question i like this one a lot yeah because you got two
[11187.34 --> 11191.34]  uh you got two brains don't you wow this thing's cool nobody cares
[11193.34 --> 11197.82]  yeah that happens to me a lot at these type of shows but i wasn't on the show for so this is all linus
[11198.86 --> 11210.30]  holy crap um okay yeah i uh i swung by like the usb if booth um and they had
[11210.30 --> 11219.34]  just like vendor showcases of of of cool tech that's coming and uh they they had um i think
[11219.34 --> 11225.02]  it was either a live demo or it was just some information on like usb 80 gig like 80 gigabit
[11225.02 --> 11232.94]  and i was like wow see you later that booth is always fun to go by yeah and never worth making a video
[11232.94 --> 11237.74]  at yeah but like yeah absolutely every time it's here it's cool and they're here every time so
[11237.74 --> 11244.54]  and there's i love going through there's like i wasn't there this year so i'm going to describe
[11244.54 --> 11248.62]  it poorly but there's one side of the hall which is like more consumer focused stuff then there's
[11248.62 --> 11253.34]  the other side of the hall which is like you know the the companies that actually make the things that
[11253.34 --> 11258.78]  a lot of the other brands are branding um going through that section is very interesting yeah i think
[11258.78 --> 11264.46]  we did a video on that one year actually uh msi makes a car charger apparently in some markets
[11264.46 --> 11271.26]  that's right so i was like uh okay and uh oh i dropped by i dropped by this company that makes
[11271.90 --> 11278.38]  switches with screens on them and it's for it's for like aviation consoles and stuff like that
[11279.26 --> 11285.66]  and it so not like key switches not for like a keyboard well they are but not for a keyboard but
[11285.66 --> 11294.70]  like for for like a giant dashboard you know uh i was like wow super cool see you later um
[11297.18 --> 11306.70]  yeah what else man that's uh this is like not uh no not video worthy uh super micro had a really
[11306.70 --> 11313.02]  cool liquid cooled server in fact there's a ton of immersion and conventional liquid cooling server stuff
[11313.02 --> 11320.30]  there's a lot of stuff that shows like this that like seven to ten years ago we probably would
[11320.30 --> 11326.46]  have made a bunch of videos about um but at this point especially with how youtube is doing things
[11326.46 --> 11334.46]  um if those videos aren't just like bangers it can hurt the channel so you gotta be careful yeah
[11335.02 --> 11339.90]  okay hit me okay speaking of hurting the channel linus in the event of your death who would you want
[11339.90 --> 11346.62]  to sponsor your funeral and how would the segue go i would expect it to be dbrand i would hope it was
[11346.62 --> 11354.06]  too red as well yeah that's like if my if my if my coffin didn't have like a damascus vinyl skin on it
[11354.06 --> 11360.94]  i'd be extremely disappointed you have to your coffin and your car have to match yeah oh i'm crying with
[11360.94 --> 11367.50]  tears of laughter you get driven to it in a hearse that is also wrapped well yeah they could well no no
[11367.50 --> 11370.78]  it would they it wouldn't need to be a hearse they could just get the longer tycan
[11373.26 --> 11376.86]  rip out the back seats and throw me in there i think i mean you wouldn't even need to rip out
[11376.86 --> 11381.18]  the back seats i'm not that tall just stuff me in the truck
[11385.26 --> 11393.02]  oh boy yeah so actually you know what if i want to do a speech it's just a segue to a sponsor
[11393.02 --> 11399.58]  the yeah i'm gonna ask for a commitment um right now actually oh no message um
[11402.30 --> 11408.22]  i'm live on the wang show right now and i need you to commit to sponsoring my funeral if i die
[11409.26 --> 11415.90]  period i expect the coffin to be wrapped in whatever your gaudiest tackiest pattern is
[11415.90 --> 11424.06]  okay i will i will he literally just said that to dbrand i will let you guys know um
[11425.26 --> 11429.26]  what i'll let you know what they say assuming they get back to me in a in a timely manner here i think
[11429.26 --> 11441.34]  you're crying oh oh oh okay uh hey ltd team linus luke i have a question re-watching the office moving
[11441.34 --> 11448.38]  vlogs in them uh linus keeps referring to having to move and inspectors making sure you are moved out
[11448.38 --> 11456.86]  did anyone kick you out yes yeah see you see we had a certain caretaker for the property
[11458.78 --> 11465.26]  that never did anything and so the neighbors got mad about the state of the property and started poking
[11465.26 --> 11470.46]  around and realized we were running a commercial entity there uh the good news is by the time this
[11470.46 --> 11476.46]  whole thing came to a head um we were already planning to move anyway so when the city came
[11476.46 --> 11481.10]  and said hey you guys need to move or we're gonna start finding you like thousands of dollars a day
[11481.10 --> 11485.58]  uh we were like hey hey whoa whoa whoa okay hold on hold on hold on the only reason that we haven't
[11485.58 --> 11493.74]  moved yet is because of like city permitting issues so like can we chill can we work together to get us
[11493.74 --> 11498.86]  out of here it was never supposed to grow this big it was supposed to be small and everything was fine
[11498.86 --> 11503.18]  um yeah and they were like
[11507.10 --> 11515.50]  okay so we got that all we got that all sorted out but it did mean that we had to get in there a little
[11515.50 --> 11521.74]  bit sooner than the building was actually ready because our other contractor who we've worked with
[11521.74 --> 11529.90]  a few times and are mostly fairly pretty good okay pretty okay pretty good uh martini construction um
[11530.94 --> 11538.30]  they were experiencing some delays at that time um overall shout out shermar
[11540.46 --> 11547.42]  pretty shout out martini they're pretty okay um not shout out grn pool and landscape that's where i'm at
[11547.42 --> 11557.02]  um hey guys from recent coverage you clearly have a great relationship with reps from tech companies
[11557.02 --> 11562.30]  as previously unshared stories of reps just coming through and helping you out big time
[11563.98 --> 11569.18]  oh i mean it's endless right how could we do anything that we do without help from these passionate
[11569.18 --> 11575.10]  people at these companies that you know just want people to to see and enjoy their products right like
[11575.10 --> 11583.90]  it's i i know it sounds really cheesy when i say it like that but there is no there is no wizard hiding
[11583.90 --> 11591.90]  in the side room there is no scooby-doo aha that like really is it for a lot of people who work in the tech
[11591.90 --> 11596.62]  industry and it's one of the reasons that like compensation in the tech industry kind of sucks
[11596.62 --> 11600.86]  because people are so passionate about it they just like really want to build cool tech products
[11601.42 --> 11607.90]  um and that's a shame but it's also really cool that everyone's so passionate so i don't know what to
[11607.90 --> 11615.90]  tell you um you know i want everyone to be compensated fairly but i also want to work with people who are
[11615.90 --> 11619.82]  super passionate and i think there are some employers that will always try to leverage that right
[11621.90 --> 11628.22]  um was there anything that made you personally excited that won't make its way into a video and
[11628.22 --> 11636.86]  what was it um i think we just did that yeah i think excited i mean i wasn't excited by the switch
[11637.82 --> 11645.42]  no this i think this is more general than uh than computex and computex yeah i think it was computex
[11646.06 --> 11650.86]  okay um moving on then well i mean i was still thinking oh okay sorry
[11651.90 --> 11654.38]  made me excited but won't make its way into a video
[11658.06 --> 11666.06]  never mind i'm over it do you see the opportunity for a physics like add-in card for ai with games
[11666.06 --> 11672.06]  moving forward no no no i don't think no we're going to use our we're going to use our gpus for ai we've
[11672.06 --> 11680.86]  already the the the the the time for more add-in cards i think is past and the time of of tightly
[11680.86 --> 11690.06]  integrated chips is now old man yeah hi lld been watching since 2011. what did you think about the
[11690.06 --> 11697.98]  modded 3070 with 60 gigs of 16 gigs of ram and what do you guys think that nvidia will do with the
[11697.98 --> 11703.98]  companies behind those mods great job nvidia will ignore it and what do i think about it i think
[11703.98 --> 11710.46]  it's super cool and i'm really frustrated because we actually had the idea of modding additional vram
[11710.46 --> 11719.02]  on gpus and testing them like years ago and i asked um gary who now works for us but previously worked at
[11719.02 --> 11724.22]  asus if he could facilitate getting us access to the gear that we would need to do something like that
[11724.22 --> 11728.38]  or at the very least recommending what gear we would need to do it and he was like yes yes yes yes yes
[11728.38 --> 11742.38]  yes yes yes yes yes boom other people did it so thanks gary love you all everyone's doing it oh well
[11742.38 --> 11747.26]  you still have to you still have a chance to miss it by another couple years love you all first purchase
[11747.26 --> 11754.06]  buying abc for a dear friend's new baby with ivan being uh the behind the scenes superstar she
[11754.06 --> 11761.74]  is what are some of the ways she enjoys feeling celebrated your dynamic is inspiring she named
[11761.74 --> 11766.86]  companies after her she just really appreciates no she doesn't like that ivan umbrella court the problem
[11766.86 --> 11777.26]  with um the problem for ivan i think is that i appreciate her i know what she does but she feels
[11778.22 --> 11784.30]  and in some cases it's not accurate but in other cases it is she feels like other people don't
[11784.30 --> 11788.38]  necessarily know or appreciate what she does and so she doesn't want to hear it from me
[11789.18 --> 11794.94]  like you know good job honey here's your quarterly performance review a plus like that means nothing to
[11794.94 --> 11803.58]  her um you know what she what she enjoys is uh being appreciated by the people at work or by um by
[11803.58 --> 11810.54]  partners or by like i like i know there there are there's at least one member of one of our families
[11810.54 --> 11816.62]  i'm keeping this as vague as i can um not that it'll make a difference because you know i guess you might
[11816.62 --> 11825.02]  know who you are that just doesn't seem to understand that she doesn't just hang out at her husband's
[11825.02 --> 11832.30]  business all day you know like i i remember a comment was made at some point like three years after our last
[11832.30 --> 11836.54]  kid was born it was like so are you ever going to go back to work and she's like
[11838.94 --> 11845.02]  what you mean in the pharmacy you understand that i am at work right that i never stopped working really
[11845.98 --> 11856.30]  um how many times do i have to tell you that i work for our company uh like just yeah it's just
[11856.30 --> 11862.86]  it's just rude right like it's ridiculous um you know i think that you know for her it's
[11863.74 --> 11870.94]  it's the there are things that i can do like she appreciates it when i notice just you know casual
[11870.94 --> 11876.62]  misogyny and that's not a word that i throw around right like i think that misogyny has come to mean
[11877.58 --> 11884.06]  just anything at this point um i think it's it's it's a lost a lot of its original meaning because
[11884.06 --> 11890.38]  now all of a sudden everything is misogyny and it's it's it's not um but there but there are things
[11890.38 --> 11897.98]  that are you know like the way that uh you know a contractor will come to the door and i'll answer the
[11897.98 --> 11903.74]  door and they'll ask a bunch of questions and i'll be like yeah i actually don't know um my wife knows
[11903.74 --> 11909.02]  that give me a second i'll go get her and then i'll stand there and they'll keep talking to me
[11909.02 --> 11915.34]  even though she so she's talking to them but they're looking at me you yeah my my girlfriend is
[11915.34 --> 11921.02]  buying a car and she's in the car with me she's asking the questions and the dude is looking at
[11921.02 --> 11925.50]  her while she's asking the question and then looks at me and answers the question like what are you doing
[11925.50 --> 11932.46]  yeah um so she you know she appreciates it when i when i notice and you know just you know give her a
[11932.46 --> 11938.06]  little pat on the back after like hey i noticed and that wasn't cool um you know obviously we're
[11938.06 --> 11944.62]  not going to make a scene about something stupid like that but like hey i felt your pain there or i
[11944.62 --> 11950.38]  was aware of it um and it's you know it's it's similar with stuff uh with stuff to do with work as
[11950.38 --> 11959.42]  well like when you know when someone walks up to me and thanks me for throwing a christmas party when
[11959.42 --> 11965.98]  i didn't touch it um and yvonne did all the work and she's standing right there uh i'll just be like
[11966.94 --> 11972.06]  hey they mean thanks to you too ah you know like it's it's tough right
[11974.14 --> 11982.54]  i do sometimes refer to you too as a unit i know just which i try to i try to try to go the other way
[11982.54 --> 11987.34]  with it i do is all i'll say yeah yeah yeah i'd like to think that i do better these days than i
[11987.34 --> 11993.74]  used to but i'll catch myself sometimes and like i contribute to the problem too like i went and named
[11993.74 --> 11997.98]  the stupid company after myself which in retrospect was absolutely a mistake i wish i called it something
[11997.98 --> 12004.70]  else i tried it's a lot of paperwork to change it now yeah uh like really expensive
[12004.70 --> 12015.74]  yeah moving on okay hey gang what in your opinion is the thing oh hold on people are
[12015.74 --> 12019.58]  hold on hold on one quick thing people are like well obviously you should just say it was all her
[12020.38 --> 12025.58]  right but you gotta understand that it's not that simple for people with that kind of mindset
[12025.58 --> 12032.54]  where like only a man could have done anything um and she would say this and i and i would i was like
[12032.54 --> 12038.94]  kind of dismissive of it i was like no way but she'd say like no if you do that if you defend me
[12038.94 --> 12045.50]  people just assume that it's fake contribution that it's because i've told you to do it yeah and then
[12045.50 --> 12052.70]  i was like no way and we did it for a bit and she was right people just have their minds made up they
[12052.70 --> 12058.46]  see whatever they want to see they hear whatever they want to hear and i don't mean that universally but
[12058.46 --> 12063.82]  some people do and so you just have to kind of go you know yeah i'm i'm sorry that happened i'm that
[12063.82 --> 12076.14]  sucked um i know what you did and yeah go ahead sorry dan go ahead no that's totally fine hey gang
[12076.14 --> 12080.70]  what in your opinion is the thing the tech community strongly demands or desires
[12080.70 --> 12085.10]  that you know will end up being something that everyone will regret wanting
[12089.10 --> 12096.22]  jeez what is with these questions how am i supposed to how am i supposed to do that i mean
[12096.86 --> 12102.78]  i think i think we could have called it on horse armor um what else though
[12102.78 --> 12111.74]  do you think like do you think ai and gaming is going to be one of those things we regret regret
[12112.46 --> 12118.94]  wanting no i think that'll be really cool yeah what are we going to regret wanting
[12120.78 --> 12125.74]  i mentioned earlier in the show people wanting uh all the reviewers opinions to be the same i don't
[12125.74 --> 12131.18]  know if that really fits the yeah the spirit of this question but i i would say that i i actually like
[12131.18 --> 12135.98]  i i know i'm like making a big deal about it but i i think that's extremely bad and like people need
[12135.98 --> 12144.78]  to really crush that immediately but you know what i like it good job cool got him i agree with you i
[12144.78 --> 12151.34]  have exactly the same cake i do that to him all the time how is he so good at this just in case people
[12151.34 --> 12159.66]  didn't get that oh it's maddening hi linus luke and dan love all the computex covering from ldt and
[12159.66 --> 12165.50]  other outlets this year has there been any tech trend good or otherwise from the different vendors
[12165.50 --> 12172.94]  that surprised you this year i didn't expect behind the motherboard you know hidden connectors to get
[12172.94 --> 12180.14]  so much attention it feels like the kind of thing we could have done forever ago and didn't so i i just
[12180.14 --> 12184.94]  not not the not the pc community but like connectors on backing motherboard is not a new thing no no not
[12184.94 --> 12191.66]  at all a new thing to like gaming pc yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh i'm uh yeah i'm i'm i don't know
[12191.66 --> 12196.78]  if i'm excited for it like we definitely need to see some new case designs to really get the most out of
[12196.78 --> 12206.78]  it but i'm not not excited for it definitely it surprised me i yeah i think it's pretty cool um here
[12206.78 --> 12214.06]  okay another tech trend i am amazed by the number of companies getting into like sim racing tech
[12214.06 --> 12221.74]  cooler master showed off a chair that has been weird hasn't it ek showed off this entire 25 000
[12222.94 --> 12228.70]  kit that was very surprising ek of all i yeah i kept asking people like your shirt was ek it wasn't
[12228.70 --> 12237.50]  like someone else how many people are buying like multi-access no there's absolutely for it but like
[12237.50 --> 12243.26]  like you think it would support like two brands total or something yeah not not the amount that
[12243.26 --> 12250.22]  are in it like it's it's one of those things where like i know what tooling costs yeah it costs a lot
[12250.22 --> 12257.10]  you got to be selling like thousands of something to make it make sense to manufacture it well sort of
[12257.10 --> 12261.18]  depending on the price gibram and flowplane chat said it really took off with the pandemic so
[12261.18 --> 12267.50]  i agree especially like f1 and stuff sim racing at home like the actual professional drivers were
[12267.50 --> 12272.30]  doing it on stream and stuff oh my god who was spending that kind of money on this sort of thing
[12272.30 --> 12280.14]  also it's sort of over and we're already seeing consumer trends setting back to what they were before
[12280.14 --> 12288.06]  i just i don't know i just don't get it like i'm like i'm thinking about the amount of the amount of
[12288.06 --> 12300.94]  money i would have to be earning to spend 25 000 on a toy and part of it because you're going to end
[12300.94 --> 12306.38]  up investing more or spending i should be saying you're going to end up spending more for sure because
[12306.38 --> 12312.94]  that's like where you start right yeah and no the pro drivers are not buying some kit from ek or some
[12312.94 --> 12319.18]  chair from cooler master like i just crazy stuff yeah they are getting some consultant to come in
[12319.18 --> 12325.18]  and build them like a very custom like d-box setup or whatever else right like i just yeah people like
[12325.18 --> 12334.94]  it's a hobby like sure what an insane hobby it takes up so much space though like wow i just
[12334.94 --> 12344.30]  and yes yes i know they start at much much lower prices for diy kits i just it's one of those things
[12344.30 --> 12347.18]  it's like uh it's like an alienware laptop
[12349.90 --> 12356.22]  in theory these things exist or in theory people are buying them otherwise they wouldn't exist you
[12356.22 --> 12361.66]  never see but i've never seen one yeah and and i i have seen an alienware laptop now i'm talking more
[12361.66 --> 12367.02]  like back when i was working at ncix 10 years ago you know alienware had five thousand six thousand
[12367.02 --> 12371.58]  dollar laptops back then and they were obviously i mean even the desktops you know i would look at it
[12371.58 --> 12377.02]  and i'd go alienware is a brand of computers obviously otherwise they wouldn't have a website
[12377.02 --> 12381.90]  but i've never seen one you know i've never seen an actual gamer gaming on one of these and so it's the
[12381.90 --> 12387.42]  same thing like these sim these sim setups it's the kind of thing we build for spectacle or like
[12387.42 --> 12394.86]  dead mouse had one but how many dead mouses are there in the world people with the means the space
[12395.58 --> 12402.14]  and the passion for gaming they can't they just can't be that many
[12403.34 --> 12410.14]  shraf and float plane chat it says in all caps it's cheaper than actually hobby racing irl it's like okay
[12410.14 --> 12419.42]  well i wouldn't do that either that sounds really expensive exactly time consuming i mean yeah i uh
[12420.30 --> 12425.42]  and i i you know what this is one of those things where i think i just have to acknowledge that as
[12425.42 --> 12431.90]  not a car enthusiast i will never be able to put myself into the headspace of a car enthusiast i mean
[12431.90 --> 12439.34]  i i i know for a fact that jake has relatively limited space compared to someone like dead mouse
[12439.90 --> 12447.74]  yeah and he still feels it's a high enough priority to have a sim racing setup in his computer room yes
[12447.74 --> 12457.02]  same for ed we saw this in their extreme tech upgrades so clearly it's a thing but like
[12457.02 --> 12465.98]  25 000 ek rig yeah that seems outlandish yeah next up we gotta get through these we got we got stuff to
[12465.98 --> 12471.82]  get to sorry sorry as a gun collector that's entry level yeah i will never understand collecting
[12472.70 --> 12476.70]  i'm sorry i just don't think i will my favorite comparison you do some collecting
[12477.74 --> 12484.30]  sorry you do some collecting sure what do i collect controllers sort of i use them all my controller
[12484.30 --> 12488.22]  collection is like nine controllers like they actually are all in my daily rotation but they're
[12488.22 --> 12495.10]  all in the rotation say that you didn't buy that like xbox edition one the prototype one right project
[12495.10 --> 12501.50]  scarlet yeah you do use it yeah but you still bought it in what i would see as like a a collector approach
[12502.54 --> 12508.14]  yeah i guess that's true when i said collection i meant more in terms of like when i okay when i heard
[12508.14 --> 12512.78]  gun collection i was thinking like okay how many how many guns can one person fire at once
[12512.78 --> 12520.38]  my collector control my collector my controller collection can all actually be used all at once
[12520.38 --> 12526.38]  like playing mage quit i actually just need 10 controllers so if i'm going to have to have 10
[12526.38 --> 12531.10]  controllers why would i buy all the same one i don't consider that a collection
[12534.38 --> 12541.82]  i have some very collector-y unique uh item controllers you appreciate unobtainium
[12542.78 --> 12549.90]  in things i do which is not it's not 100 the same either and like people are talking about my gold
[12549.90 --> 12554.14]  controller i knew you were going to go go there with this but i wouldn't have done that if it wasn't
[12554.14 --> 12561.74]  to make a video yeah i wasn't gonna for that reason i wasn't even yeah um yeah people like to be frank
[12561.74 --> 12567.74]  many collectors item guns you shouldn't fire for safety reasons yeah yeah this is what i'm talking about
[12567.74 --> 12572.78]  um yeah that i don't understand i also don't understand people that buy things with the purpose
[12572.78 --> 12578.62]  of leaving them in the box i've never i've never understood that at all okay schrodinger's item i
[12578.62 --> 12585.18]  need to talk to the community about this yeah i know what you're gonna reference yeah um we have a sponsor
[12585.18 --> 12592.14]  i'm not going to name them you can guess uh are you able to create a poll we have a sponsor that wants
[12592.14 --> 12604.70]  to send us multiple not one but multiple sealed clear or like like color trans transparent edition n64s
[12605.74 --> 12612.62]  to unbox all of them on short circuit and i'm looking at it going
[12612.62 --> 12624.38]  um i think keep it simple just uh should we is it cool or is it bad and i'm looking at this going
[12624.38 --> 12634.94]  i think people are going to be really angry about us breaking the seals on like five transparent n64s
[12636.54 --> 12640.62]  people are already on both sides of this see this is what i don't i don't understand
[12641.26 --> 12645.90]  actually in this latest because like what's the point what's the point of leaving in the box i
[12645.90 --> 12651.50]  almost think it's worse to leave in the box because then no one gets to enjoy it all you get to enjoy
[12651.50 --> 12656.46]  is the external cardboard and you could still enjoy that if you took it out of the box yeah but it's
[12656.46 --> 12660.94]  just it's one of those things like i just don't get it from my point of view even though i'm not a
[12660.94 --> 12667.02]  collector and i frankly just don't really get it it's like it's like taking some hollow foil
[12667.02 --> 12675.58]  first print char charizard or something and just like ripping them up oh or like folding the corner
[12675.58 --> 12679.02]  because you're not you're not ripping it out but you're like haha i made this worth less
[12679.58 --> 12684.06]  watch me do it again haha i did it again i don't think that works because you could still play the
[12684.06 --> 12689.98]  game with it without doing that but you could still play the well you can't play the n64
[12689.98 --> 12700.38]  but we're because you could like treat it nicely no one's gonna play tcg with a first edition hollow
[12700.38 --> 12706.94]  foil charizard i totally would you're an idiot but i wouldn't buy one but like and if i had one
[12706.94 --> 12714.62]  one of them i would sell it because i don't see the value in it right you know i don't think you're
[12714.62 --> 12719.58]  an idiot well no because i i would never be in that scenario because other people value it so much more
[12719.58 --> 12726.38]  that i would sell it immediately so you're saying if it didn't you're saying i should take the n64s
[12726.38 --> 12733.50]  and i should sell them i mean if it was absolutely because if it's in my possession and i can't sell it
[12733.50 --> 12739.66]  like sure i'm gonna open it or if if if i have this hollow charizard but if i sell it i go to jail
[12740.70 --> 12746.06]  i don't care i'm not going to just leave it on a shelf that has literally genuinely zero value to
[12746.06 --> 12750.30]  me i'm also probably not going to play the game with it because i also don't care about that but
[12751.66 --> 12758.30]  i wouldn't mind especially if it's in like a nice sleeve or whatever why do i care dbrand responded
[12758.30 --> 12763.10]  will send the bill to ivan i think they misunderstood i want them to pay to sponsor the
[12763.10 --> 12775.10]  funeral i can't tell with these guys sometimes um all right the poll seems pretty conclusive that
[12775.10 --> 12784.14]  it's cool you apparently have but those bats are gonna be real mad oh yeah yeah oh yeah
[12784.14 --> 12795.26]  like those are those are some i i pretty much bet you the intensity of voting here is not equal the
[12795.26 --> 12799.98]  people that are saying cool are like me they don't care it doesn't matter they're not going to watch a
[12799.98 --> 12807.50]  video because you happened to open it you know what i mean the bads are going to be enraged because you
[12807.50 --> 12812.54]  happen to open it like these are these are different things like i just don't value something remaining in
[12812.54 --> 12818.62]  a box i don't value a car that doesn't get driven i don't value a console that doesn't get played
[12818.62 --> 12825.58]  like i don't i don't care about those things so you're saying i'm allowed to buy an expensive car
[12825.58 --> 12831.10]  he he he told me he was like worried about my my soul or something like that like if i got too
[12831.74 --> 12837.42]  like into you know just luxury stuff which is fair uh so but but i'm allowed to buy an expensive car
[12837.42 --> 12842.38]  which you don't seem to have a problem with as long as you get to drive it um you also didn't
[12842.38 --> 12848.22]  get the other one you're talking about but if i had two and i can only drive one at once is that a
[12848.22 --> 12854.22]  problem now well no it's not because if you drove them at all because there's people that will will
[12854.22 --> 12858.94]  acquire a car or the firearm in the previous conversation or a pokemon card in the previous
[12858.94 --> 12863.50]  conversation or a console in this conversation and never they will refute they will leave it in the
[12863.50 --> 12868.38]  box they'll never touch it they'll be in like a climate controlled glass thing okay and you're
[12868.38 --> 12872.14]  not even allowed within a foot of it all this type of stuff well what if it was a middle ground what if
[12872.14 --> 12876.78]  i had two cars a daily driver and one that i only drive on sunday so that i can keep it in good
[12876.78 --> 12881.42]  condition at least you drive it at least you drive it okay what if i had seven cars one for every day
[12881.42 --> 12886.62]  of the week at least that's literally not so for you it's just black and white for you pretty much
[12886.62 --> 12893.90]  you should use the thing so i'm allowed to have a toyota corolla gr then yes yeah i love how excited
[12895.02 --> 12899.42]  that's a sweet car and like really you'd have to actually drive it though that would be my i would
[12899.42 --> 12903.66]  drive it yeah that thing looks freaking awesome yeah awesome but you you should enjoy it because
[12903.66 --> 12908.54]  it's cool to drive like the firearm example like if you have this firearm that you keep in a safe
[12909.42 --> 12913.98]  oh you should keep never allowed out if you if you shoot it on like special occasions what i mean by
[12913.98 --> 12918.94]  the safe is like you never even get to see it like yeah but if it's like a special occasions thing
[12918.94 --> 12927.90]  like um even once a year as long as it's used it's like all right i don't i don't mind that but
[12927.90 --> 12936.78]  like it it feels notably bad to me to just be like no i'm gonna keep this n64 and it's gonna stay in a box
[12936.78 --> 12941.82]  forever and i don't want it to ever be used i don't want anyone to ever play a game on it i don't
[12941.82 --> 12946.46]  want anyone to ever touch it it's translucent which is awesome but it's gonna stay in cardboard
[12946.46 --> 12951.66]  so never no one will ever see through this translucent plastic like what ah that seems
[12951.66 --> 12957.58]  that's rough to me i i actively don't like that but the amount that i actively don't like that is
[12957.58 --> 12963.42]  very small and the amount that people don't like it when you open those things is very big yeah
[12963.42 --> 12971.50]  everyone wants me to get the gr yes please it's a sweet car ah i've been so close like twice and it
[12971.50 --> 12975.82]  just feels really stupid because i can only drive one car at once i don't think you should actually
[12975.82 --> 12979.98]  but then my tycan's been in the shop for like almost six weeks what if you sell the tycan
[12979.98 --> 12985.90]  and get the gr i'm not going to go back to going to gas stations all the time honestly as stupid and
[12985.90 --> 12993.82]  trivial as it sounds that is a huge part of the reason that i like driving an electric car i hate
[12993.82 --> 13000.70]  refueling i don't know if you should get it then take but my argument is maybe not the thing that you
[13000.70 --> 13008.30]  might think it would be sorry sorry yeah go for it we're gonna massive delay sorry and my reasoning is
[13008.30 --> 13015.74]  because of a comment that you made not even that long ago when you had to drive your old volt yeah
[13015.90 --> 13020.62]  volt right volt you had to drive your old volt again and you're like yeah i mean it's really not
[13020.62 --> 13027.18]  that different that's my reason why i don't think you should get it the gr oh the gr would be different
[13027.18 --> 13033.58]  is it would it be would you actively actually enjoy it it has a manual transmission oh okay yeah it's a
[13033.58 --> 13042.38]  three-cylinder manual tranny like super lightweight just that sounds fun like stupid would you track it
[13042.38 --> 13049.34]  um i mean he would track it for me you'd track it for him oh i mean oh god he'd probably he'd probably
[13049.34 --> 13053.74]  maybe to rent it can you drive me around can i go with you you should you should buy the two
[13054.94 --> 13060.62]  you're getting a type r yeah i have two deposits two deposits yeah are you going to scalp one so you
[13060.62 --> 13065.66]  can afford the other yeah okay sure i've been waiting for like a year and a half i don't i'm not
[13065.66 --> 13074.94]  going to judge you i don't care yeah andy's going type r all right well let's let's keep going because
[13074.94 --> 13081.66]  like we're actually late oh yeah yeah like a lot at lunch yeah oh yeah like people are flying out
[13081.66 --> 13087.58]  and stuff and the show's been on for almost four hours we need to okay yeah let's go okay uh if you
[13087.58 --> 13091.42]  guys want to go through potentials and respond to them i'll start reading you the rest of the curated
[13091.42 --> 13096.30]  i'll go from a lot of them are stuck for you oh okay i'm sure with this taiwan trip you have
[13096.30 --> 13101.18]  gotten to eat some great food what are some standout foods or meals you have experienced in different
[13101.18 --> 13112.46]  countries uh by a long shot the best food i ever ate anywhere was uh on the intel trip i couldn't
[13112.46 --> 13119.18]  believe how good the food was there um taiwan is really great too though i just man i just love like
[13119.90 --> 13124.22]  just like comfort food here just like beef noodle soup we went for like really good beef noodle soup
[13124.22 --> 13131.18]  last night it's just so good hi linus luke and dan what has been the greatest challenge in your
[13131.18 --> 13137.42]  lifetimes to overcome and how did you overcome it uh oh wow i just replied to that one i think the
[13137.42 --> 13145.02]  obvious answer is kids man it's uh raising kids is the most challenging and important thing i will ever do
[13145.02 --> 13149.90]  you are you doing curated or potential at the moment potentials i'm gonna start at the top of
[13149.90 --> 13159.90]  potentials okay uh i uh okay that one must have come down and pushed it i see uh what a computex do
[13159.90 --> 13166.38]  you wish you could make uh what the hell is going on there's duplicates hi lld with your ongoing goal of
[13166.38 --> 13172.46]  making a badminton court complex what other sports centers or storefronts would you like to try and open
[13172.46 --> 13181.98]  i would like to see you open a pc or mobile phone repair shop oh that's very unlikely to happen i
[13181.98 --> 13187.90]  could see us doing i could see us doing like a gaming airbnb or like a gaming hotel but like in a
[13187.90 --> 13194.70]  more of like a western style um i could see i could see expanding the racket sport thing i could see adding
[13194.70 --> 13201.18]  like squash and racquetball and like tennis and like doing like like a like a huge complex and i'm assuming i
[13201.18 --> 13205.98]  have unlimited money for this which i don't um it's just going to be badminton and it's just going
[13205.98 --> 13210.22]  to be a small pro shop but hey if i'm imagining things then that's that's what i would imagine
[13212.78 --> 13219.02]  one of your rare 45 plus viewers i retire in two and a half years and wonder if you would recommend
[13219.02 --> 13222.62]  a new career in tech at 50 and what would you point to
[13222.62 --> 13230.86]  well we have a lot more 45 plus viewers than you would think i can tell you that much already just
[13230.86 --> 13236.46]  based on people who walk up to me at trade shows and on the street um as for a new career in tech
[13236.46 --> 13242.30]  man that's tough tech is always moving so fast the the best thing is to just you know keep your ear to
[13242.30 --> 13251.90]  the ground um and you know chase your passion right like i uh the the billionaire that i was meeting
[13251.90 --> 13257.02]  with uh i i asked you know hey well you know obviously i could probably look this up but uh
[13257.02 --> 13261.98]  you know i'd love to hear it from you instead you know what's your story and i was just so impressed by
[13261.98 --> 13268.46]  how passionate he was about what he was doing and i just i loved that and it started with just trying
[13268.46 --> 13273.82]  to fix a simple problem just identifying something that was a problem and and and building a solution
[13273.82 --> 13278.62]  for it that he was excited about i just i thought that was so cool and i think that's just a great
[13278.62 --> 13284.62]  approach for everybody whether you make a dollar or a billion dollars um if you can solve a problem
[13284.62 --> 13288.54]  you're going to get satisfaction from it and if you can solve a problem that a lot of people have then
[13289.10 --> 13293.58]  well you're more likely to not make just a dollar
[13293.58 --> 13302.46]  gentlemen and linus i'm picking up the abc book for my soon-to-be niece looking forward to
[13302.46 --> 13308.54]  indoctrinating her everyone asks about parenting tips but do you fellas have any uncle-ing tips
[13312.54 --> 13315.10]  i don't know i feel like it's pretty easy you're more of an uncle than me
[13315.82 --> 13322.54]  i literally am because well i actually i actually have a nephew niece okay yeah i mean you have the
[13322.54 --> 13326.86]  easy job right you get to swoop in when it's fun and hang out and then when things suck you get to
[13326.86 --> 13335.58]  leave so it's like i don't know um i haven't been one of kids that are old enough to really do a lot
[13335.58 --> 13341.02]  of the things that i think uncles would be best at doing um but the things that i'm prepared and
[13341.02 --> 13349.18]  excited to do is like be very present um like when when my brother's daughter grows up i'm sure she will
[13349.18 --> 13357.18]  be involved in some type of activity i don't know whether it's a sport or something else but um i
[13357.18 --> 13367.58]  would like to to be there and support um yeah i don't know try to help with like um opportunity
[13367.58 --> 13374.70]  enablement as much as possible if if my brother and his wife are are busy try to help stuff like that
[13374.70 --> 13380.30]  i just treat my nephew and niece like i would my kids um i firmly believe that you know kids need
[13380.30 --> 13385.18]  structure and i think just being the fun uncle is not necessarily a good play i want to be the
[13386.06 --> 13391.66]  uh the uncle that gave them good advice and told them the right things and um you know checked them
[13391.66 --> 13395.82]  when they were when they were doing something that was gonna cause problems um
[13395.82 --> 13404.46]  yeah i just uncle exactly the same as i parent that's true i feel the same way about like dogs
[13404.46 --> 13410.78]  and stuff too it's the same thing i just you're not going to be there all the time so i i think
[13411.42 --> 13416.86]  something that gets lost on a lot of people in that situation is that um the kids still value you being
[13416.86 --> 13421.18]  there even though you're not their direct parents so you shouldn't forget that and you should actually be
[13421.18 --> 13428.94]  there and they like notice when you're not there so yeah linus you've mentioned your socks before
[13428.94 --> 13438.54]  what are your favorite configs for your daily socks i only wear one sock um well unless i'm trialing
[13438.54 --> 13444.70]  prototypes of the socks that we're trying to make uh and they're just darn toughs regular like crew sock
[13444.70 --> 13448.22]  i actually was on their site the other day because someone asked me about this and i didn't see the exact
[13448.22 --> 13454.62]  model that i have anymore but they're they're just so good merino wool they're they're the reason that
[13454.62 --> 13461.58]  we haven't made a sock yet because i can't beat them or match them if we can even get like 95 of the
[13461.58 --> 13469.26]  way there i'll consider that good enough but we can't yet last of mine curated hey dll how important
[13469.26 --> 13475.82]  is it for you to not be recognized in public when you just want to enjoy something else now you guys are
[13475.82 --> 13483.66]  famous uh greetings from germany i give up just yeah there's a there was a video that came out
[13483.66 --> 13493.42]  recently of some some dude streaming riding a bike um in norway or something and he he goes past uh
[13493.42 --> 13499.42]  magnus carlson who's sitting on a bench watching something on his phone and the guy asked for a selfie
[13499.42 --> 13504.94]  from magnus that magnus is like first of all tells him like sorry i don't want to be bothered right now
[13504.94 --> 13510.22]  and the guy talks to him anyways and then he goes could i like get a selfie with you after i watch
[13510.22 --> 13515.02]  this thing and the guy's like no i'm in a hurry right now i need it right now and gets really pushy
[13515.02 --> 13519.58]  and then magnus like goes to take the photo with them and then the guy asked for magnus to stand up
[13519.58 --> 13526.86]  for the photo and you can tell that magnus is like really annoyed but just doing it anyways like the
[13526.86 --> 13531.98]  the dude's streaming this whole time so now this interaction is on camera and it's just like oh man
[13531.98 --> 13541.10]  stuff like that's really rough i um i always prefer that people like say hi um because i i would
[13541.10 --> 13546.62]  always rather know that you recognize me than sit there and like wonder if people around me know who
[13546.62 --> 13551.42]  i am um but i know that's not true for everyone it's gonna be slightly different for everybody
[13551.42 --> 13553.42]  which is like annoying but it is what it is
[13556.70 --> 13563.58]  so excited to get the 3d down jacket just in time for 90 degree fahren oh crap i know what that sound
[13563.58 --> 13573.58]  is uh read this one the alarm's going up uh he's trying to get my attention this is loud beeping uh sorry
[13573.58 --> 13580.30]  guys uh so excited for my 3d down jacket for 90 fahrenheit weather that's hot for the celsius folks out
[13580.30 --> 13587.18]  there uh can't wait for the ltt bro tank in december uh linus what's the first home project you ever did
[13587.18 --> 13598.94]  and how did it go i assume you mean when i moved into my place and i'm having a really hard time actually
[13600.14 --> 13609.42]  coming up with that i think i think one of the first kind of home diy things that i did was actually on
[13609.42 --> 13616.78]  video though i ran an ethernet cable along the outside of the house to where the media pc is
[13616.78 --> 13622.22]  and i had a contractor help me but i actually did do some of the work myself as well and i made a video
[13622.22 --> 13631.18]  about it um for me like networking is the first thing that needs to be improved in a house because
[13631.18 --> 13641.26]  typically it sucks i didn't did i do that much handy stuff yeah i guess i started doing it a lot later
[13641.26 --> 13648.14]  like i don't count you know painting the nursery when we had kids is that a is that a a home project
[13648.14 --> 13654.86]  yeah oh how did that how do they define it what's the first home project you ever did yeah that went
[13654.86 --> 13659.58]  well i mean i i paint also painted the um all the furniture for the nursery painted it white
[13659.58 --> 13666.06]  uh so we had this kind of fun kind of pastel yellow and white color scheme in there um
[13669.34 --> 13671.58]  man it's amazing the things you forget
[13675.42 --> 13682.30]  yeah i'm gonna go with that i did that okay the police aren't on their way thankfully
[13683.34 --> 13688.46]  um let's see what we got here linus assuming in your new position you will get a modicum of
[13688.46 --> 13692.22]  more free time what kind of things are you going to pick up in this free time
[13695.10 --> 13700.62]  more hosting um more coaching i want to do more coaching for our hosts and our shooters and you know
[13700.62 --> 13706.14]  help make sure that our everything we upload is is lmge
[13709.26 --> 13715.34]  uh i hear that there are new firmware updates on the ally have you noticed any improvements uh that others
[13715.34 --> 13717.90]  have not
[13719.98 --> 13729.50]  no um i oh i can respond to this other one at the same time from joshua uh as uh responding to how
[13729.50 --> 13734.30]  tears of the kingdom has been on the allies so far it's been oh i've got a couple of these raven also
[13734.30 --> 13739.26]  asked how's tears of the kingdom on the ally uh the performance i'm getting is not great right now but
[13739.26 --> 13744.38]  i've got to be honest with you the only time i had to play it was on the plane and other than loading
[13744.38 --> 13751.50]  all the files onto it ahead of time i didn't really research anything so i was kind of trying to figure
[13751.50 --> 13758.70]  it out on my own on the plane i tried to apply a 60 fps mod and it seemed to make performance worse
[13758.70 --> 13764.06]  though i wasn't really sure performance seemed lower than it should have been because breath of the wild
[13765.02 --> 13770.14]  runs amazing on it and i wasn't really expecting tears of the kingdom performance to be that much
[13770.14 --> 13774.94]  lower than breath of the wild given that they don't seem to look that different to me uh i i
[13774.94 --> 13779.10]  you know could have missed something though and i'm not just talking like when it's compiling shape
[13779.98 --> 13785.18]  this is really not working very well uh i'm not just talking when it's compiling shaders i mean just
[13785.18 --> 13793.26]  in general performance seemed pretty pretty rubbish actually and it would kind of um start lagging more
[13793.26 --> 13799.10]  sometimes too so it hasn't been a great experience so far in tears of the kingdom but it ran breath of
[13799.10 --> 13804.70]  the wild great but i was using seen you for breath of the wild and i'm using yuzu for tears of the
[13804.70 --> 13809.90]  kingdom and i'm new to yuzu i have spent almost no time with it i don't really i don't really know the
[13809.90 --> 13818.22]  ins and outs so i forget what the original question was but um no i probably haven't noticed
[13818.22 --> 13823.34]  things that other people haven't yet because i haven't really um i haven't really had much time
[13823.34 --> 13824.86]  to game in the last like couple of weeks
[13830.14 --> 13835.50]  archive hi linus do you carry any skills from your product manager days into your day-to-day life
[13835.50 --> 13840.78]  absolutely i mean every everything you do every person you meet is an opportunity to learn and i
[13840.78 --> 13845.66]  think that's something that i i do a relatively good job of it's just keeping my eyes open and
[13846.30 --> 13853.58]  you know trying to understand better i actually got um very some very high praise that that made me
[13853.58 --> 13862.86]  really happy when we were working on our framework factory tour which is coming um the one of the higher
[13862.86 --> 13871.10]  upsets framework uh used to work in like supply chain for apple and said that when i did my original
[13871.10 --> 13876.62]  framework video explaining why a company needs investment and i started explaining how the supply
[13876.62 --> 13883.74]  chain works that i got it like 85 to 90 right to the point and and like the parts that were like
[13884.94 --> 13892.46]  not that were not wrong they were just like maybe not as thorough um but she she's like super sharp and so
[13892.86 --> 13899.34]  you know whenever i whenever someone gives me praise i always consider the source so i appreciated
[13899.34 --> 13908.06]  her saying that because she seems like a shark um and uh she said yeah you got like 85 90 right and i'm
[13908.06 --> 13913.02]  kind of sitting here going how does anyone in the media have any business like knowing this much about
[13913.02 --> 13917.90]  supply chain because i've just never really seen that before and yeah it's just stuff that i've that
[13917.90 --> 13921.98]  i picked up from my product management days and from just kind of trying to pay attention try to
[13921.98 --> 13930.70]  understand better um the intro for that video is really funny i i think i wrote it but basically i
[13930.70 --> 13936.46]  i'm walking down the streets in taipei and i go you know yeah playstation 5s toilet paper
[13937.42 --> 13943.10]  framework laptops i want to buy one but they if it's not in stock what's the deal with that why
[13943.10 --> 13949.74]  don't they just make more of them and i have ample reason to be angry about the six there's a six month
[13949.74 --> 13956.62]  wait right now for the amd version of the framework yeah that's pretty rough and so so i i have ample
[13956.62 --> 13961.66]  reason to be mad about this because aside from just waiting six months for my laptop i have a lot
[13961.66 --> 13967.98]  of money riding on them being able to deliver freaking product so why aren't they just making more since
[13967.98 --> 13972.38]  i'm in taiwan anyway i thought i'm gonna knock on some doors and figure out what the heck's going on
[13972.38 --> 13977.98]  with my investment and then this is amazing and i'm sorry to kind of ruin the joke for you guys
[13977.98 --> 13984.06]  because it'll be really funny if you don't have it ruined but anyway um it cuts straight from there
[13984.70 --> 13992.46]  to me in this like shanty like back alley because when you search for framework they have an office
[13992.46 --> 13998.30]  here but when you search for framework on google maps it takes you to some it's labeled bicycle club
[13998.30 --> 14005.58]  but it seems to be like a bus repair garage oh or something and so i'm just standing and we actually
[14006.38 --> 14013.98]  went to the trouble to drive half an hour out of our way to go be at framework bicycle club in taiwan
[14013.98 --> 14022.62]  and i'm like there's a bicycle club did i just get played and then it hard cuts to the compound factory
[14022.62 --> 14029.26]  where frameworks are made and gets into the framework um the framework tour which is going to be really
[14029.26 --> 14033.42]  really exciting i've never been in a laptop manufacturing facility i don't think compel's
[14033.42 --> 14038.46]  ever done anything like that before it's gonna be really cool and i think that's it for the wanshow
[14038.46 --> 14042.94]  that is it we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[14042.94 --> 14056.94]  little different times as an earlier time yeah
[14072.94 --> 14073.90]  babe selo
[14073.90 --> 14074.94]  okay
