[1.00 --> 3.00]  Welcome to the WAN show losers!
[3.00 --> 7.00]  Well, at least, statistically speaking, at least a couple of them are.
[7.00 --> 11.00]  Most of you are cool though! We've got a great show for you today!
[11.00 --> 13.00]  Lots of great topics!
[14.00 --> 19.00]  The TikTok ban! The TikTok ban is not a TikTok ban.
[19.00 --> 20.00]  Yeah.
[20.00 --> 23.00]  It's something much more insidious.
[23.00 --> 27.00]  Masquerading as a TikTok ban. We're gonna be getting into that.
[27.00 --> 31.00]  Oh no! The Internet Archive loses a major lawsuit.
[31.00 --> 35.00]  We're big fans of the Internet Archive and this is not... this is not cool!
[35.00 --> 37.00]  What else we got today?
[37.00 --> 41.00]  AI experts advocate for a pause.
[41.00 --> 43.00]  He scrolled all the way down the dock!
[43.00 --> 45.00]  You took all... you can't even say that.
[45.00 --> 48.00]  Rapid Fire is all the way down the dock.
[48.00 --> 50.00]  Rapid Fire is on page 4.
[50.00 --> 53.00]  And you took all of the non-Rapid Fire topics, okay?
[53.00 --> 56.00]  It was a requirement that I scroll down the dock.
[56.00 --> 59.00]  I just shouldn't even pick topics anymore.
[59.00 --> 62.00]  I just... I enjoyed the time when I just yeeted us into the stream.
[62.00 --> 63.00]  That was fun!
[63.00 --> 68.00]  Anyways, AI experts advocate pause on high-level AI development.
[68.00 --> 71.00]  Oh, I really wanted to say something spicy about that right then,
[71.00 --> 74.00]  but I will wait until later in the show.
[74.00 --> 77.00]  Also, Dolphin Emulator comes to Steam.
[77.00 --> 81.00]  Really? You're picking that over the changes to Twitter Blue and Legacy Verification?
[81.00 --> 83.00]  I just don't care.
[83.00 --> 87.00]  And Australia debating a mature rating for loot boxes?
[87.00 --> 89.00]  That's actually kinda sick.
[89.00 --> 90.00]  That's the only good news.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Right, we didn't address the title of the video today.
[92.00 --> 93.00]  It's all bad news.
[93.00 --> 94.00]  Yeah.
[94.00 --> 95.00]  Yep.
[95.00 --> 96.00]  Yep.
[96.00 --> 119.00]  The show is brought to you today by Zoho One, Grammarly, and JumpCloud.
[119.00 --> 125.00]  Why don't we jump right into our first topic, the worst news.
[125.00 --> 132.00]  To be clear, we're not American, so theoretically this sort of doesn't affect us or something.
[132.00 --> 134.00]  But we're Canadian, so it also definitely does.
[134.00 --> 139.00]  Yeah, and you know, America with its outsized reach in the world...
[139.00 --> 141.00]  Means it kind of affects everybody.
[141.00 --> 147.00]  The US government is continuing to debate the Restrict Act, which has been broadly characterized
[147.00 --> 150.00]  as an attempt to ban TikTok.
[150.00 --> 157.00]  Which, you know, has some merit, I guess, if you were to look at it from a certain point of view.
[157.00 --> 158.00]  Data collection, stuff like that.
[158.00 --> 164.00]  It's, you know, turning the minds of the youth into sponges, or whatever I'll think of the children argument
[164.00 --> 167.00]  you might form around that general idea.
[167.00 --> 174.00]  However, the language of the act never mentions TikTok directly, and is in fact far, far broader.
[174.00 --> 181.00]  The Restrict Act proposes to grant the Commerce Department additional investigative and punitive powers
[181.00 --> 187.00]  regarding all information and telecom companies connected to a foreign adversary
[187.00 --> 193.00]  if they pose undue and unacceptable risk to US national security or US citizens.
[193.00 --> 194.00]  Whatever that means.
[194.00 --> 197.00]  That is very, truly broad, isn't it?
[197.00 --> 199.00]  Oh yeah, that's as vague as you could possibly have it.
[199.00 --> 203.00]  Wow, that's broader than...
[203.00 --> 204.00]  Barn.
[205.00 --> 206.00]  I mean, yeah, I was...
[206.00 --> 207.00]  The broad side of it.
[207.00 --> 209.00]  Yeah, very broad.
[209.00 --> 215.00]  Okay, the foreign adversaries included in the act are China, Cuba...
[215.00 --> 216.00]  Okay, Cuba?
[216.00 --> 218.00]  Are we still against Cuba?
[218.00 --> 220.00]  Buried this hatchet?
[220.00 --> 224.00]  I actually thought they had until you said Cuba and I read it at the same time.
[224.00 --> 225.00]  I was like, oh.
[225.00 --> 228.00]  Iran, Russia, and Venezuela.
[228.00 --> 231.00]  But that list could be expanded in the future.
[231.00 --> 236.00]  Corporate entities focused on tech that are based out of these countries will face additional scrutiny,
[236.00 --> 239.00]  including potential fines and total bans.
[239.00 --> 252.00]  Language targeting third parties that aid in the subversion of these penalties has raised concerns that the act may be used to ban VPNs and to fine or even imprison those who use them.
[252.00 --> 253.00]  Whew.
[253.00 --> 254.00]  Whew.
[254.00 --> 256.00]  Okay, so here's the thing.
[256.00 --> 262.00]  The problem with legislation, right, is not what they do.
[262.00 --> 270.00]  It's what they write down that they could do and then slowly frog boil over time.
[270.00 --> 273.00]  That's why there's so much concern over this.
[273.00 --> 276.00]  A spokesperson for the primary sponsor of the bill has stated,
[276.00 --> 288.00]  This legislation is aimed squarely at companies like Kaspersky, Huawei, and TikTok that create systemic risks to the United States national security, not at individual users.
[288.00 --> 291.00]  The threshold for criminal penalty in this bill is incredibly high.
[291.00 --> 297.00]  Too high to ever be concerned with the actions of an individual user of TikTok or a VPN.
[297.00 --> 308.00]  Now, here's the problem with that, and I'm deviating from the script a little bit here, but we had a lot of the same conversations around Bill C-10, which became Bill C-11, which I don't even know what it's called anymore, here in Canada.
[308.00 --> 314.00]  Where they kind of went, oh, well, no, no, no, we're never gonna, like, do anything like that.
[314.00 --> 317.00]  It'll never restrict an individual user's ability to upload-
[317.00 --> 319.00]  If that's the case, that needs to be written into the law.
[319.00 --> 320.00]  That's right!
[320.00 --> 321.00]  Yeah.
[321.00 --> 327.00]  So, fine, put your money where your mouth is, and if it isn't a concern, then write that sh** down.
[327.00 --> 328.00]  Yeah.
[328.00 --> 337.00]  The federal governments of the US and Canada, as well as NATO and the EU, have all banned TikTok from official devices on the basis of cybersecurity concerns.
[337.00 --> 340.00]  More likely, they're just wasting time on it.
[340.00 --> 344.00]  Staff are likewise being advised to remove the app from private devices.
[344.00 --> 352.00]  France, on the other hand, has simply banned all recreational apps from official devices, rather than TikTok specifically, because I guess the French are just more direct.
[352.00 --> 353.00]  Anywho.
[353.00 --> 366.00]  One concern to raise, to be clear, I'm not saying that the way that TikTok, well, ByteDance, the way that TikTok's parent company is collecting information is not mass surveillance of foreign nationals.
[366.00 --> 368.00]  I am not saying that that's not a thing.
[368.00 --> 374.00]  I'm just saying that I'm not convinced that TikTok was suddenly what made it a concern.
[374.00 --> 377.00]  Yeah, it might be both.
[377.00 --> 386.00]  But the concern raised by US officials is, this is back on script, is that the Chinese government could press ByteDance into revealing information for use in state intelligence operations.
[386.00 --> 400.00]  And while there's no indication that the Chinese government was involved, four employees from ByteDance were fired after using TikTok data to track the location of journalists and cross-reference their location with that of employees suspected of leaking information to the press.
[400.00 --> 402.00]  Cute.
[402.00 --> 415.00]  Several commentators have criticized singling out TikTok when the majority of American corporations collect massive amounts of data from American consumers, and the American government has repeatedly been caught buying that information from them.
[415.00 --> 421.00]  Likewise, TikTok is far from unique in its impact on the mental health of teenagers, another focus of the debate in Congress.
[421.00 --> 423.00]  All of that seems extremely fair.
[423.00 --> 426.00]  So, discussion question.
[426.00 --> 432.00]  Is this a threat to personal liberties or a necessary restriction on foreign intelligence operations?
[432.00 --> 436.00]  I guess if it was...
[436.00 --> 451.00]  If it was a more trustworthy entity that was saying, hey, we really need to stop these foreign governments from spying on our citizens, I'd be like, alright.
[451.00 --> 463.00]  I 100% believe that foreign governments, and I say that for everyone anywhere, if that makes sense.
[463.00 --> 469.00]  So, like, if you are China in this situation, I would say the exact same words.
[469.00 --> 472.00]  I 100% believe foreign governments...
[472.00 --> 474.00]  Just place yourself anywhere, the statement's still true.
[474.00 --> 479.00]  Are gonna use this type of stuff to gain information on what is going on in your country.
[479.00 --> 481.00]  We're talking about spy balloons in the US.
[481.00 --> 482.00]  Sure.
[482.00 --> 483.00]  Yep.
[483.00 --> 485.00]  You think the US isn't spying on other people?
[485.00 --> 489.00]  How do you know what a spy balloon looks like?
[489.00 --> 491.00]  Mine looks like a whale!
[491.00 --> 493.00]  Do you have your own spy balloons?
[493.00 --> 496.00]  Yeah, like, it's happening in both directions.
[496.00 --> 499.00]  And I'm not saying anything about that, but...
[499.00 --> 500.00]  It's basically civ.
[500.00 --> 501.00]  Yeah.
[501.00 --> 506.00]  It's like, the diplomat gets, you know, caught doing espionage...
[506.00 --> 511.00]  One of the options is to ask them to not do it anymore, and that does nothing in the game.
[511.00 --> 515.00]  If you've played Civ before, the player just gets to decide, like, do I care about this?
[515.00 --> 516.00]  Do I kick them out?
[516.00 --> 518.00]  Which, by the way, also does nothing.
[518.00 --> 519.00]  Yeah.
[519.00 --> 520.00]  So, like...
[521.00 --> 522.00]  Cool!
[522.00 --> 523.00]  It is what it is!
[523.00 --> 528.00]  So, like, is there potential that China would use TikTok data to gain information?
[528.00 --> 529.00]  Yeah, sure!
[529.00 --> 535.00]  Is there potential that, like, US companies might be used to gain companies, uh, information from somewhere else?
[535.00 --> 536.00]  Yeah, sure!
[536.00 --> 537.00]  I don't know.
[537.00 --> 538.00]  This is a...
[538.00 --> 543.00]  If I was a person in power for one of these countries, this would be something I would be concerned about.
[543.00 --> 549.00]  I would not write into my bill that I can, like, super destroy any citizen that happens to use a VPN.
[549.00 --> 553.00]  Or, better yet, you could specifically write into your bill that you can't do that.
[553.00 --> 554.00]  Totally!
[554.00 --> 555.00]  That might be even better.
[555.00 --> 556.00]  Yeah!
[556.00 --> 558.00]  So, like, there's other ways to go around it.
[558.00 --> 560.00]  I don't think the concern is unfounded, though, is what I'm saying.
[560.00 --> 561.00]  Absolutely not!
[561.00 --> 562.00]  And...
[563.00 --> 570.00]  Along these same lines, like, if the entire impetus for this is data collection, data control, right?
[570.00 --> 571.00]  Yeah!
[571.00 --> 574.00]  That's clearly what has actually started this debate.
[574.00 --> 575.00]  Um...
[575.00 --> 576.00]  And we see...
[576.00 --> 577.00]  We see stuff...
[577.00 --> 583.00]  Then VPN usage is absolutely something that is, even if it's not part of the conversation out in the open,
[583.00 --> 586.00]  is part of the conversation behind closed doors.
[586.00 --> 591.00]  Because, while a VPN, and we've made this very clear, is not the be-all and end-all of...
[591.00 --> 592.00]  No!
[592.00 --> 600.00]  ...being secure online, it is a tool in your toolbox that can increase your anonymity online.
[600.00 --> 602.00]  It's one of the layers of Swiss cheese.
[602.00 --> 603.00]  Yes!
[603.00 --> 609.00]  One of the many, many layers that you should be using if you actually want to achieve any kind of anonymity.
[609.00 --> 611.00]  Sorry, what were you gonna say? I think I cut you off there.
[611.00 --> 619.00]  Uh, we saw, like, this is only tangentially related, but something that's been very interesting in the conflict in Ukraine
[619.00 --> 626.00]  is seeing the social media usage of both sides, and the very direct ramifications of such.
[626.00 --> 630.00]  Controlling information is, like, incredibly, insanely valuable.
[630.00 --> 637.00]  And when people are posting photos or videos or whatever else, it can be super, super bad.
[637.00 --> 643.00]  Um, data is huge. Even just turning the mic on a device could be a massive advantage.
[643.00 --> 651.00]  Someone sent me a link today to, um, a vulnerability. I don't know if it ended up in the doc or not, but I wanted to kind of mention it.
[651.00 --> 655.00]  Because, uh, coming off of last week, I just thought this would be kind of interesting to bring up.
[655.00 --> 664.00]  But, uh, an attack that I heard of a long time ago was the ability to be able to tell what keys were pressed by listening through a microphone.
[664.00 --> 668.00]  So you have nothing connected to the computer. You just have a microphone in the room.
[668.00 --> 674.00]  We discussed that on WAN Show back when the set was way on the other side of the 104 building or something like that.
[674.00 --> 680.00]  The problem more recently, I think this was as of, oh man, I don't know because I didn't look into it a ton.
[680.00 --> 686.00]  I think it's one year or four months, somewhere around there, is they just, like, not only is it open source, but they, like, made a website for it.
[686.00 --> 688.00]  So it's, like, really easy to do.
[688.00 --> 698.00]  And a pretty big attack vector for that could, like, the first thing I kind of thought of was, like, oh, streamers.
[698.00 --> 699.00]  Right.
[699.00 --> 705.00]  Because now you're, you're massively, like, yeah, the vulnerability exists, but there's a bunch of vulnerabilities exist that, like, no one really uses.
[705.00 --> 711.00]  But making a website where people can use it really easily means that the level required to be able to use it just dropped.
[711.00 --> 713.00]  Same with, like, cheaters and video games.
[713.00 --> 719.00]  This is such an interesting conversation and one that we could probably spend the next three and a half hours on.
[719.00 --> 722.00]  I mean, we did a video on the Flipper Zero this week.
[722.00 --> 723.00]  I don't know if you know that.
[723.00 --> 724.00]  Yeah.
[724.00 --> 725.00]  Yeah, so Tanner was working on it.
[725.00 --> 730.00]  And it's the kind of device that, honestly, we could do an entire week's worth of videos on.
[730.00 --> 735.00]  You could review it as a penetration testing device.
[735.00 --> 742.00]  You could review it from just, like, you could put it on Channel Super Fun and review it from a, you know, mischief kind of device.
[742.00 --> 743.00]  Yeah.
[743.00 --> 744.00]  Perspective.
[744.00 --> 746.00]  You could review it as a gaming device.
[746.00 --> 748.00]  I mean, it's chock full of games.
[748.00 --> 750.00]  You could, you could push the boundaries of it.
[750.00 --> 752.00]  You could go get, you know, custom add-ons.
[752.00 --> 754.00]  I mean, it has GPIO pins, right?
[754.00 --> 756.00]  You could, you could review all the different add-ons.
[756.00 --> 760.00]  There's people that have changed the, the displayed price of gas using them.
[760.00 --> 761.00]  So.
[761.00 --> 763.00]  It doesn't actually change the actual price, but.
[763.00 --> 769.00]  So we had to kind of decide on an angle because we can't cover it from every possible perspective.
[769.00 --> 776.00]  And what we ultimately settled on was, is it a tool or is it a weapon?
[776.00 --> 786.00]  It was sort of the, the overarching question that we were asking as we made our way through what it is, what it can do and what our position is on it.
[786.00 --> 790.00]  Because there's arguments that you can make either way.
[790.00 --> 794.00]  On the one hand, sure, let's talk about the gas station price changing, right?
[794.00 --> 798.00]  So it uses, whatever it is, like sub gigahertz band communication.
[798.00 --> 805.00]  And so it allows you to, to sniff and then replicate these commands that are, that change the, the gas station price.
[805.00 --> 812.00]  Um, you could kind of look at that and go, well, if your system was so insecure that you're not even using rolling codes, right?
[812.00 --> 819.00]  Like it's less secure than a garage door opener, which we all know is dog in terms of security, right?
[819.00 --> 823.00]  Um, well then take it as a wake up call, right?
[823.00 --> 828.00]  To harden your security and, and update that module from 1973, right?
[828.00 --> 830.00]  That you're, that you're using to update the thing.
[830.00 --> 831.00]  Sure.
[831.00 --> 837.00]  So you can say, you can, you can come at it from that perspective because, and there's a really good argument to be made here, right?
[837.00 --> 846.00]  If someone came along with real skills, not some, you know, whatever the hardware hacking device equivalent of a script kitty is, right?
[846.00 --> 848.00]  Let's call them a hack device kitty, right?
[848.00 --> 849.00]  Sure.
[849.00 --> 850.00]  Right?
[850.00 --> 862.00]  So if someone, if someone comes along who really wants to hit you, the fact that that hack kitty came along and beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, boop, changed your sign and forced you to, to harden your security a little bit might actually be a good thing.
[862.00 --> 872.00]  Because even if your security is still sort of the best you can do as some boomer gas station owner, um, it's not about necessarily having a perfect lock.
[872.00 --> 876.00]  It's about having a better lock than your neighbor's door in many cases.
[876.00 --> 877.00]  Yeah.
[877.00 --> 878.00]  No, it's, it's true.
[878.00 --> 879.00]  It's not, it's not false.
[879.00 --> 881.00]  It's like running away from the bear.
[881.00 --> 883.00]  Well, you don't have to be faster than the bear.
[883.00 --> 884.00]  Hold on.
[884.00 --> 886.00]  I'm going to counter this being true actually really quick.
[886.00 --> 887.00]  Sure.
[887.00 --> 888.00]  Um, and.
[888.00 --> 889.00]  You just got to be faster than the other guy.
[889.00 --> 890.00]  He's going to be mildly upset.
[890.00 --> 896.00]  Um, I think pretty soon it's not going to matter at all.
[896.00 --> 897.00]  Like what?
[897.00 --> 901.00]  There will be enough arms that they'll just catch both of you.
[901.00 --> 905.00]  There was a demo at, um, Defcon.
[905.00 --> 915.00]  I don't remember when, where they had a circle of servers and they had AI running on the servers and they had like a capture the flag hack contest between all of them.
[915.00 --> 918.00]  And they fought each other automated using AI.
[918.00 --> 920.00]  And that was a bit ago.
[920.00 --> 924.00]  The future of cybersecurity using AI is going to be insane.
[924.00 --> 926.00]  And they're, everything's going to be automated.
[926.00 --> 927.00]  They're gonna be hitting everything at the same time.
[927.00 --> 928.00]  Sure.
[928.00 --> 933.00]  So if your neighbor and your lock both suck, but yours is better, they're both broken.
[933.00 --> 934.00]  That's fair.
[934.00 --> 935.00]  Okay.
[935.00 --> 936.00]  That's fair.
[936.00 --> 943.00]  Where I was ultimately getting to here was there's the argument to be made that the wake up call to harden your security is probably a good thing.
[943.00 --> 949.00]  Even if there's another exploit that someone more skilled could absolutely use to get past you.
[949.00 --> 950.00]  Yeah.
[950.00 --> 962.00]  And the example that we use is that there's this other, um, from great Scott gadgets, there's this other hacker device that actually can defeat rolling code implementations of the, of the gas station sign changer.
[962.00 --> 976.00]  Um, so even though you, so even though the, the, uh, the flipper zero can defeat these extremely basic ones, um, and it's, it's starting this conversation and it's inconvenient for the owners of these gas stations.
[976.00 --> 978.00]  It's overall a good thing.
[978.00 --> 979.00]  At least that conversation is starting.
[979.00 --> 984.00]  And the flipper zero is actually specifically designed to not be able to defeat rolling code ones.
[984.00 --> 989.00]  So it's more like, um, a basic pen testing.
[989.00 --> 990.00]  Yeah.
[990.00 --> 997.00]  Do dad and less like a serious hacking device, which is really good to have in the hands of people because of the reasons you were just talking about.
[997.00 --> 1008.00]  However, yeah, the flip side of that argument is that there is still extremely dangerous things that a ne'er do well, or even, you know,
[1008.00 --> 1014.00]  or even not a ne'er do well, just a particularly committed individual could do with a device like that.
[1014.00 --> 1026.00]  Even just the gas station one, because like, if you own the gas station across the street and you just keep making theirs look more expensive, like you could cause genuine actual harm.
[1026.00 --> 1034.00]  Well, I was talking more in terms of like the way that the flipper zero can be used to access, um, apartment buildings that have older NFC access systems.
[1034.00 --> 1035.00]  Yeah.
[1035.00 --> 1039.00]  Um, and you know, for the average prankster, so what?
[1039.00 --> 1043.00]  What they go in, they like, they tag the mailboxes or something like that.
[1043.00 --> 1049.00]  It's really inconvenient and unnecessarily costly, but if it's in the hands of someone like an ex-husband.
[1049.00 --> 1050.00]  Yeah.
[1050.00 --> 1051.00]  Some stalker.
[1051.00 --> 1053.00]  There's been a bunch of stalkers in like the...
[1053.00 --> 1061.00]  And that argument, that argument that like, well, this is a good, it's good that these devices are out there and everywhere because it's the wake up call.
[1061.00 --> 1070.00]  We all need to harden our security, but someone who's, who's running away from an abusive relationship and is staying in some, some craptastic apartment.
[1070.00 --> 1071.00]  But not feel that way.
[1071.00 --> 1076.00]  Is not in any position to change the security systems of the apartment building.
[1076.00 --> 1077.00]  Yeah.
[1077.00 --> 1079.00]  That's actually not within their power in any way.
[1079.00 --> 1081.00]  And now these, these tools are everywhere.
[1081.00 --> 1084.00]  And so it's kind of like what you were saying about this, this keyboard tool.
[1084.00 --> 1093.00]  It's like on the one hand, yeah, it's good that we're raising the profile of, uh, of these attack vectors so that people are more mindful of them.
[1093.00 --> 1103.00]  But on the other hand, even though you're right, that was an attack vector that already existed, just like the changing gas stations thing could have been done for 10 bucks.
[1103.00 --> 1104.00]  Totally.
[1104.00 --> 1106.00]  You know, 15 years ago with some part off of Amazon.
[1106.00 --> 1107.00]  Laptop and some hardware.
[1107.00 --> 1112.00]  And the rolling code one's been defeated for six years by that great Scott Gadgets one or whatever.
[1112.00 --> 1121.00]  Um, just because these vectors have existed for a long time doesn't mean that they're in the hands of like your jackass, you know, ex-husband.
[1121.00 --> 1122.00]  Yeah.
[1122.00 --> 1123.00]  Right.
[1123.00 --> 1124.00]  And so there's a...
[1124.00 --> 1133.00]  By the way, if streamers are freaking out about the password thing and if you do have to type in passwords on stream, the, the thing that I've thought of so far that I think is the most hilarious to defeat this.
[1133.00 --> 1136.00]  Um, and I, I like going with the, the rule of cool.
[1136.00 --> 1137.00]  Yeah.
[1137.00 --> 1140.00]  Um, is make a, make a stream deck thing, assuming you have one.
[1140.00 --> 1142.00]  That's a big assumption.
[1142.00 --> 1143.00]  Oh, well.
[1143.00 --> 1153.00]  Um, you can make some soundboard or whatever, make some type of way to mute your microphone and play a recorded sound and just record yourself typing in something that's like funny.
[1153.00 --> 1154.00]  Yeah.
[1154.00 --> 1158.00]  And then use that type in your password and then hopefully it ends and unmutes you soon enough.
[1158.00 --> 1163.00]  And I just like, like screw off whatever, just have that be what's typed in.
[1163.00 --> 1164.00]  I think it'd be entertaining.
[1164.00 --> 1166.00]  I think that's, I think that's expecting a lot.
[1166.00 --> 1167.00]  It is.
[1167.00 --> 1169.00]  And not being able to type in passwords on stream is crazy.
[1169.00 --> 1172.00]  And like some people are going to be like, Oh, like you shouldn't do that anyways.
[1172.00 --> 1173.00]  I don't mean having it on screen.
[1173.00 --> 1174.00]  Yeah.
[1174.00 --> 1180.00]  I mean, everyone knows you shouldn't, but people are going to stream for 13 hours and they're probably going to have to type in a password to something.
[1180.00 --> 1181.00]  Looking at you XQC.
[1181.00 --> 1188.00]  Yeah, but like for real, like he might have to sign into something at some point.
[1188.00 --> 1191.00]  So like, I actually think, and it's been out for a while.
[1191.00 --> 1200.00]  This isn't new or anything, but just thought I should bring it up because I wasn't personally aware that there was like a site for this and the usability just went through the roof.
[1200.00 --> 1204.00]  Sec it guy says this conversation is pissing me off.
[1204.00 --> 1206.00]  You can buy PCB printers right now.
[1206.00 --> 1208.00]  You're arguing against advancement.
[1208.00 --> 1210.00]  If they're motivated enough, they will get in.
[1210.00 --> 1212.00]  That's actually not true though.
[1212.00 --> 1213.00]  It's sec it guy.
[1213.00 --> 1214.00]  But yeah.
[1214.00 --> 1215.00]  Yeah.
[1215.00 --> 1216.00]  No, I know.
[1216.00 --> 1217.00]  I was just messing with him.
[1217.00 --> 1218.00]  Yeah.
[1218.00 --> 1223.00]  But that's actually not true.
[1223.00 --> 1235.00]  I mean, in the bubble that you presumably live in, maybe every single person, you know, would be capable of defeating some kind of building security system.
[1235.00 --> 1236.00]  This might be true.
[1236.00 --> 1241.00]  With just like stuff that they buy off of, you know, at a fruit and Amazon or whatever, right?
[1242.00 --> 1243.00]  Maybe that's true.
[1243.00 --> 1258.00]  But in the broader world, like just that, that jerk stalker that you went to high school with, like is probably just like, not probably, but is possibly just a slack jawed idiot that no, could never figure that out.
[1258.00 --> 1260.00]  This is a thousand years would never figure it out.
[1260.00 --> 1263.00]  There's even similar conversations with hardware locks.
[1263.00 --> 1276.00]  The main reason why I'm bringing this up is just because there's, there's often this situation where like people that are into software don't trust software locks and people that are into hardware, like they don't trust software locks.
[1276.00 --> 1279.00]  They want hardware locks and the people that are into hardware don't trust hardware locks.
[1279.00 --> 1280.00]  So they want software locks.
[1280.00 --> 1287.00]  And it's like, blah, stuff like access to bump keys and high quality lock picks and everything has never been.
[1287.00 --> 1290.00]  Anywhere close to how it is now.
[1290.00 --> 1295.00]  Like the, the prevalence of security tools for pen testing.
[1295.00 --> 1296.00]  Yeah.
[1296.00 --> 1301.00]  But also being able to get through some aged systems has never been quite as common.
[1301.00 --> 1308.00]  And that's why I think I I've also never heard as many people talking about like Swiss cheese style security approaches.
[1308.00 --> 1309.00]  Right.
[1309.00 --> 1316.00]  And home security and stuff like that is because we are, we are in like a relatively sketchy time when it comes to that type of stuff.
[1316.00 --> 1317.00]  Yep.
[1317.00 --> 1325.00]  And so like, again, so you'll, you'll see in the flipper zero video, we ultimately make the argument that the existence of the flipper zero is a net positive.
[1325.00 --> 1341.00]  But it's also important for us to consider that the widespread availability of these tools, whether it be they software or be they hardware, or are some combination of the two is not necessary.
[1341.00 --> 1342.00]  It is good.
[1342.00 --> 1343.00]  It seems like a good thing.
[1343.00 --> 1346.00]  Until you're the one with a stalker who broke into your apartment.
[1346.00 --> 1347.00]  Yeah.
[1347.00 --> 1350.00]  And did it with something that they bought for 20 bucks on Amazon.
[1350.00 --> 1351.00]  Right.
[1351.00 --> 1361.00]  When 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, they would have had to go and build up the skill set to craft it themselves, which they probably wouldn't have done.
[1361.00 --> 1365.00]  Because as we've, as we've seen with security levels are extremely important.
[1365.00 --> 1380.00]  So coming back to it, not being necessarily important to have the best lock, but to have a better lock than your neighbor, looking at the security footage that we've had of people breaking into things sometimes.
[1380.00 --> 1385.00]  It's very clear that it's the lowest hanging fruit.
[1385.00 --> 1388.00]  It's whatever's fastest most of the time.
[1388.00 --> 1403.00]  And while it's true that if someone is determined enough, they will get into whatever, most just fly by theft or random vandalism is not determined enough.
[1403.00 --> 1406.00]  It just, it's impulsive, right?
[1406.00 --> 1418.00]  So you're taking a very rational state of mind that you're in, a very calculating state of mind that you might be in, and you're applying it to people who are not necessarily planning long term.
[1418.00 --> 1419.00]  Right?
[1419.00 --> 1424.00]  Like you look at, you know, think about, there's this entire category, crimes of passion, right?
[1424.00 --> 1437.00]  A crime of passion doesn't happen over a span of 19 months as someone, you know, reads up on electronics engineering and PCB design and, you know, micro...
[1437.00 --> 1438.00]  It's reactionary.
[1438.00 --> 1442.00]  Yeah, micro, microprocessor, you know, control.
[1442.00 --> 1443.00]  Like it's...
[1443.00 --> 1446.00]  That's not how that works.
[1446.00 --> 1457.00]  Whereas if someone can just get drunk, you know, drop down to the local Best Buy, pick up some tool that is going to give them, you know, easy access to someone, and...
[1457.00 --> 1467.00]  It's like, yeah, it's all theoretically good that these pen testing tools are out there until it's, you know, your relative or you.
[1467.00 --> 1470.00]  It's like, oh yeah, it's good for everyone else, I guess.
[1470.00 --> 1471.00]  Right?
[1471.00 --> 1473.00]  So it's tough.
[1473.00 --> 1474.00]  It's tough, man.
[1474.00 --> 1477.00]  I don't have the right, I don't have the answers.
[1477.00 --> 1478.00]  Yeah.
[1478.00 --> 1480.00]  I'm just saying, it's not black and white.
[1483.00 --> 1484.00]  Yeah.
[1484.00 --> 1485.00]  Anyways.
[1485.00 --> 1486.00]  Cool.
[1486.00 --> 1491.00]  I think that was all the first discussion question.
[1491.00 --> 1493.00]  Uh, what is the second one?
[1493.00 --> 1494.00]  Nah, we can move on.
[1494.00 --> 1495.00]  Okay.
[1495.00 --> 1496.00]  Sounds good.
[1496.00 --> 1499.00]  Uh, all the topics today are going to be rough.
[1499.00 --> 1502.00]  There's only like one that has an upside.
[1502.00 --> 1505.00]  Uh, but yeah, we'll, we'll keep going.
[1505.00 --> 1507.00]  Are we talking about Internet Archive now?
[1507.00 --> 1508.00]  Sure.
[1508.00 --> 1509.00]  I can go for it.
[1509.00 --> 1516.00]  Starting in 2020, four large book publishers sued the Internet Archive over its decision to lift its user cap.
[1516.00 --> 1520.00]  on digital lending as an emergency response to global library closures.
[1520.00 --> 1525.00]  Late last week, a judge ruled in favor of the publishers.
[1525.00 --> 1533.00]  The plaintiffs include Penguin Random House, Hatchet, and Harper Collins, the three largest traditional publishers in the world.
[1533.00 --> 1535.00]  I was going to say, I recognize all of these.
[1535.00 --> 1541.00]  The fourth is academic publisher John Wiley and Sons, who I assume were just happy to be included.
[1541.00 --> 1542.00]  That was editorial.
[1542.00 --> 1552.00]  Um, in all seriousness though, I could see an academic publisher being, uh, very interested in this because piracy of academic...
[1552.00 --> 1554.00]  Yeah, well they try to charge for all their papers.
[1554.00 --> 1555.00]  Yeah, exactly.
[1555.00 --> 1558.00]  So, so piracy of that stuff is like huge.
[1558.00 --> 1560.00]  By the way, it's pretty common.
[1560.00 --> 1566.00]  If you figure out who the author of an academic paper is and you email them, they will often send it to you for free.
[1566.00 --> 1567.00]  I did not know that.
[1567.00 --> 1568.00]  Yeah.
[1568.00 --> 1569.00]  Oh, that's kind of cool.
[1569.00 --> 1574.00]  It's like definitely something you can take advantage of and something I have literally done from my personal non-work email.
[1574.00 --> 1578.00]  So they like, didn't, I wasn't trying to like use my clout to figure it out.
[1578.00 --> 1579.00]  It's a good hack.
[1579.00 --> 1580.00]  Yeah.
[1580.00 --> 1587.00]  It's a lot of these people want to share this information, but it has to go through these publishing companies that, uh, want to loot.
[1587.00 --> 1588.00]  So yeah.
[1588.00 --> 1603.00]  Anyways, uh, the internet archive offers an extensive range of scanned books on the basis of controlled digital lending or CDL, a system where libraries can lend out as many digital copies of a book as it has physical copies sitting in storage.
[1603.00 --> 1613.00]  Many publishers sell eBooks to libraries at a significant markup, typically around 250%, while others refuse to sell eBooks to libraries at all.
[1613.00 --> 1622.00]  CDL has been used as a legal rationale for over a decade, allowing libraries to buy and scan books that otherwise would be unavailable in digital format.
[1622.00 --> 1627.00]  The ruling doesn't just punish internet archive for lifting its lending caps.
[1627.00 --> 1637.00]  It also describes CDL as a violation of copyright and form of theft, which has potential ramifications for libraries throughout the U S depending on fines levied.
[1637.00 --> 1652.00]  It could also threaten other internet archive projects like the way back machine, which I am certain you have seen not only on the WAN show a bunch of times, but also in LTT content because it is insanely useful.
[1652.00 --> 1653.00]  So important.
[1653.00 --> 1658.00]  The internet archive says that it plans to appeal the decision.
[1658.00 --> 1662.00]  This sucks.
[1662.00 --> 1663.00]  Sure does.
[1663.00 --> 1667.00]  I like don't even know where to start.
[1667.00 --> 1668.00]  It just sucks a lot.
[1668.00 --> 1675.00]  The, the loss of libraries is going to be a horrible thing and libraries are super cool.
[1675.00 --> 1679.00]  And a lot of libraries have been adapting in super cool ways.
[1679.00 --> 1681.00]  But libraries aren't profitable, Luke.
[1681.00 --> 1682.00]  They're not.
[1682.00 --> 1683.00]  They're not.
[1683.00 --> 1684.00]  Yeah.
[1684.00 --> 1685.00]  Yeah.
[1685.00 --> 1686.00]  So why should we have them?
[1686.00 --> 1687.00]  Kind of like by design.
[1687.00 --> 1688.00]  They're not.
[1688.00 --> 1689.00]  Why should I pay for libraries?
[1689.00 --> 1690.00]  What did they ever do for me?
[1690.00 --> 1691.00]  If the people can't see.
[1691.00 --> 1693.00]  I've already read every book I want to read.
[1693.00 --> 1696.00]  So why should I pay for libraries anymore?
[1696.00 --> 1699.00]  It reminds me.
[1699.00 --> 1700.00]  I know.
[1700.00 --> 1703.00]  If other people want a library, they should build their own library and they should pay for it.
[1703.00 --> 1704.00]  Some people have done that.
[1704.00 --> 1706.00]  Have you seen the like, what are they called?
[1706.00 --> 1707.00]  Little libraries?
[1707.00 --> 1708.00]  Free little libraries?
[1708.00 --> 1710.00]  Those are super cool.
[1710.00 --> 1711.00]  Yeah.
[1711.00 --> 1712.00]  Those are wicked.
[1712.00 --> 1716.00]  The people will do like, it looks like a, almost a big mailbox with a glass front.
[1716.00 --> 1720.00]  If that's fair to say, or like a bird house with a glass front.
[1720.00 --> 1721.00]  Yeah.
[1721.00 --> 1724.00]  Uh, and you'll just be like driving down a street and you'll see it's at the end of someone's
[1724.00 --> 1725.00]  driveway.
[1725.00 --> 1729.00]  And it, it is like a little library to have, it'll have a couple of shelves and has books
[1729.00 --> 1731.00]  on the shelves and you can just take whatever you want.
[1731.00 --> 1736.00]  And ideally, theoretically you, you bring it back or maybe you donate some to the little
[1736.00 --> 1738.00]  library, super, super cool systems.
[1738.00 --> 1740.00]  Um, but libraries are awesome.
[1740.00 --> 1746.00]  Um, and we also need larger libraries though, because those little libraries are not going
[1746.00 --> 1750.00]  to have things like a microfiche archives of newspapers.
[1750.00 --> 1754.00]  Um, they're not, I mean, they're not going to have, they're not going to be able to manage
[1754.00 --> 1755.00]  digital lending.
[1755.00 --> 1756.00]  Yeah.
[1756.00 --> 1760.00]  And the newspaper thing, like, this is why we have the Wayback Machine.
[1760.00 --> 1764.00]  Like it's, it's helpful to be able to look back at what happened.
[1764.00 --> 1768.00]  And even if you don't think like the hit this, the, the, the subject of history in school
[1768.00 --> 1770.00]  is the most interesting thing.
[1770.00 --> 1771.00]  I sure didn't.
[1771.00 --> 1775.00]  I have been in a bunch of different situations in my life.
[1775.00 --> 1780.00]  Literally one time I found myself at the Vancouver library going through their newspaper stack
[1780.00 --> 1783.00]  thing that you're literally describing now, trying to figure something out.
[1783.00 --> 1784.00]  This has happened.
[1784.00 --> 1786.00]  This does happen to people.
[1786.00 --> 1793.00]  It's important for journalism and it's important for people's, um, ability to do things sometimes.
[1793.00 --> 1798.00]  Cause you need to know how we got to where we are now, um, to be able to help inform how
[1798.00 --> 1800.00]  you get to the next step.
[1800.00 --> 1805.00]  This just, it's just so, so many different aspects of this just suck.
[1805.00 --> 1811.00]  And like, I, I appreciated that the internet archive was trying to step up when there was
[1811.00 --> 1814.00]  a insane amount of global library closures.
[1814.00 --> 1815.00]  Um, yeah.
[1815.00 --> 1825.00]  And I do appreciate that, um, copyright holders do need to protect their rights.
[1825.00 --> 1830.00]  Um, but not selling to libraries is not protecting your rights.
[1830.00 --> 1831.00]  It's just being a jerk.
[1831.00 --> 1844.00]  And, um, it just sucks.
[1844.00 --> 1845.00]  Yeah.
[1845.00 --> 1848.00]  I don't really know what else to say other than that.
[1848.00 --> 1849.00]  Yeah.
[1849.00 --> 1850.00]  This, this, this does just suck.
[1850.00 --> 1853.00]  You know, it's a funny thing cause I can't really figure out what the, what the benefit
[1853.00 --> 1856.00]  is to the traditional publisher model anymore.
[1856.00 --> 1861.00]  Like, uh, Yvonne has this app that she uses to read all the time and people just, uh, they
[1861.00 --> 1863.00]  just upload stories.
[1863.00 --> 1867.00]  And a lot of the time you, you'll actually, it's more like a tip system or like a microtransaction
[1867.00 --> 1868.00]  system.
[1868.00 --> 1870.00]  So you'll, you'll read the first chapter.
[1870.00 --> 1875.00]  And then if you want to read the next chapter, it's like, however many tokens, which I actually
[1875.00 --> 1877.00]  really do not like that.
[1877.00 --> 1879.00]  It's tokens instead of actual money.
[1879.00 --> 1880.00]  Yeah.
[1880.00 --> 1881.00]  You lost me when we got to that part.
[1881.00 --> 1882.00]  Yeah.
[1882.00 --> 1890.00]  But overall the idea of just, um, of people just self publishing on a platform.
[1890.00 --> 1894.00]  I don't, this, this is like, I just, why do you need to, this is definitely out of ignorance,
[1894.00 --> 1898.00]  but the biggest one that I don't understand is for music.
[1898.00 --> 1899.00]  That one is so weird to me.
[1899.00 --> 1903.00]  I watched an interview recently with a musician talking about how they made, they made one
[1903.00 --> 1906.00]  song that was just like a massive hit.
[1906.00 --> 1911.00]  And they're like, yeah, it was great because I was with so-and-so, whatever publisher.
[1911.00 --> 1915.00]  And now that has done so well that I don't need a publisher anymore.
[1915.00 --> 1920.00]  And I'm like, well, it's a whole, who, you know, thing, right?
[1920.00 --> 1921.00]  Like, I mean, okay.
[1921.00 --> 1923.00]  So here's something that, so, okay.
[1923.00 --> 1925.00]  The, the ABCs of gaming.
[1925.00 --> 1930.00]  We, we self published it because I could afford to do a production run of like thousands,
[1930.00 --> 1931.00]  tens of thousands of books.
[1931.00 --> 1932.00]  Yeah.
[1932.00 --> 1934.00]  But you're not, you know, people aren't buying CDs anymore.
[1934.00 --> 1935.00]  Well, okay.
[1935.00 --> 1938.00]  Well, uh, but no, I'm pretty sure people still buy CDs.
[1938.00 --> 1940.00]  No, for real though.
[1940.00 --> 1941.00]  Yeah.
[1941.00 --> 1942.00]  I know.
[1942.00 --> 1943.00]  The look on your face.
[1943.00 --> 1944.00]  No, really though.
[1944.00 --> 1946.00]  Is it like an appreciable amount of like, okay, sure.
[1946.00 --> 1949.00]  People buy records too, but like, is it, is it appreciable amount of your sales?
[1949.00 --> 1950.00]  No.
[1950.00 --> 1952.00]  Is it going to make or break this situation?
[1952.00 --> 1953.00]  I do think people buy CDs.
[1953.00 --> 1954.00]  What?
[1954.00 --> 1955.00]  I, I, I, look, I know.
[1955.00 --> 1957.00]  What do they play them in?
[1957.00 --> 1958.00]  It's CD players.
[1958.00 --> 1959.00]  What?
[1959.00 --> 1960.00]  I know.
[1960.00 --> 1961.00]  I know.
[1961.00 --> 1963.00]  Where do you buy those?
[1963.00 --> 1968.00]  When's the last time you saw a CD player in like Best Buy?
[1968.00 --> 1969.00]  What is it?
[1969.00 --> 1970.00]  Am I crazy?
[1970.00 --> 1971.00]  Is this a thing?
[1971.00 --> 1973.00]  CDs are definitely still sold.
[1973.00 --> 1976.00]  CDs are the new vinyl.
[1976.00 --> 1977.00]  I hope that's not true.
[1977.00 --> 1978.00]  There's no way.
[1978.00 --> 1979.00]  Dude.
[1979.00 --> 1981.00]  Our generation is so cringe sometimes.
[1981.00 --> 1982.00]  Hold on a second.
[1982.00 --> 1983.00]  Come on.
[1983.00 --> 1984.00]  Hold on a second.
[1984.00 --> 1988.00]  Why is it any less cringe than vinyl?
[1988.00 --> 1992.00]  Let me, let me, let me come at it with the exact same arguments.
[1992.00 --> 1995.00]  I like to hold the physical thing as part of the experience.
[1995.00 --> 1996.00]  I like to put, I'm not done yet.
[1996.00 --> 1998.00]  I feel myself losing this argument already.
[1998.00 --> 2006.00]  I like to put it in the thing and it spins and it's mechanical and it comes with the artwork and you can appreciate the artwork and you can put it on display.
[2006.00 --> 2007.00]  Okay.
[2007.00 --> 2008.00]  And get this.
[2008.00 --> 2009.00]  It's so much more compact than a vinyl record.
[2009.00 --> 2010.00]  It's right in the name.
[2010.00 --> 2011.00]  It's a compact disc.
[2011.00 --> 2012.00]  Compact disc.
[2012.00 --> 2015.00]  That was good.
[2015.00 --> 2022.00]  Um, and, and I honestly, I felt myself immediately lose that argument because I want physical copies of games so that I own them.
[2022.00 --> 2023.00]  Yeah.
[2023.00 --> 2027.00]  And if you have music streaming services, if you have movie streaming services, whatever, you don't own it, they can take it anytime.
[2027.00 --> 2028.00]  So, okay, cool.
[2028.00 --> 2030.00]  Buy your CDs, whatever.
[2030.00 --> 2034.00]  But I'm surprised that's a significant amount of sales is what I'm trying to get at.
[2034.00 --> 2035.00]  It's a thing, man.
[2035.00 --> 2036.00]  It's a thing.
[2036.00 --> 2037.00]  Yeah.
[2037.00 --> 2040.00]  Like again, it comes down to our bubbles, right?
[2040.00 --> 2041.00]  Cause even the, okay, hold on.
[2041.00 --> 2045.00]  Even in that interview with that musician, he was talking about how many times it got streamed.
[2045.00 --> 2046.00]  Sure.
[2046.00 --> 2047.00]  Yeah.
[2047.00 --> 2051.00]  Because streams are the major metric now, but don't care.
[2051.00 --> 2052.00]  Okay.
[2052.00 --> 2056.00]  Especially if you have a song, but, but Taylor Swift is selling a lot of albums.
[2056.00 --> 2057.00]  She's selling CDs.
[2057.00 --> 2058.00]  Yeah.
[2058.00 --> 2059.00]  Sure.
[2059.00 --> 2061.00]  See, this is what I was talking about where like, it's probably coming from ignorance.
[2061.00 --> 2062.00]  Cause like, I have no idea.
[2062.00 --> 2063.00]  Yeah.
[2063.00 --> 2066.00]  But you're like, you're like, you're like, you're like IT sec guy over here, right?
[2066.00 --> 2069.00]  Where, where it's, you're, you're living in your bubble.
[2069.00 --> 2070.00]  I guess so.
[2070.00 --> 2071.00]  Yeah.
[2071.00 --> 2076.00]  You and everyone you know, has thought, what, has anyone bought a CD since the closure of A&B Sound?
[2076.00 --> 2077.00]  Okay.
[2077.00 --> 2083.00]  But if I, and everyone I know, which is a decent range of people that are not in the IT industry.
[2084.00 --> 2085.00]  Not that many.
[2085.00 --> 2086.00]  One.
[2086.00 --> 2087.00]  I know one.
[2087.00 --> 2091.00]  But you gotta remember.
[2091.00 --> 2096.00]  It's like the- Maybe my friend group is not.
[2096.00 --> 2099.00]  This is like, it's like Heisen, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
[2099.00 --> 2100.00]  Oh no.
[2100.00 --> 2104.00]  You, by observing someone, could change the outcome.
[2104.00 --> 2105.00]  Yeah, fair.
[2105.00 --> 2109.00]  The very fact that you know them at all, could change their behavior.
[2109.00 --> 2110.00]  Yeah.
[2110.00 --> 2117.00]  Because they would, they would unwrap their new CD in front of you, and show it to you all proud of how shiny it is.
[2117.00 --> 2118.00]  And I'd be like, what the heck?
[2118.00 --> 2120.00]  And you'd be like, are you a f***ing idiot?
[2122.00 --> 2125.00]  I can't believe you actually spent real money on this.
[2125.00 --> 2126.00]  I can't believe you've done this.
[2126.00 --> 2127.00]  You get it for free.
[2127.00 --> 2130.00]  And even then, why didn't you immediately throw it in the garbage?
[2130.00 --> 2132.00]  Just digitize it right away.
[2132.00 --> 2133.00]  Exactly.
[2133.00 --> 2143.00]  So, no, we gotta get ourselves out of our bubbles sometimes, and realize that there is a great big world out there, full of people who are still buying CDs.
[2143.00 --> 2150.00]  Like I think it, wasn't it only a year or two ago that millennials overtook boomers as the largest remaining demographic?
[2151.00 --> 2153.00]  Oh, are we that group now?
[2153.00 --> 2155.00]  I didn't even know that.
[2155.00 --> 2157.00]  Like, for real though.
[2157.00 --> 2159.00]  It's the end game, boys.
[2159.00 --> 2162.00]  And here's, like, here's another thing, okay?
[2162.00 --> 2166.00]  Man, okay, I remember going to my high school reunion.
[2166.00 --> 2169.00]  And, so this was, this was a while back, right?
[2169.00 --> 2170.00]  Because I didn't even bother.
[2170.00 --> 2172.00]  I graduated in, Facebook exists.
[2172.00 --> 2179.00]  I graduated in 2000, so, oh, okay, so it was in, it was in the mid 2010s, okay?
[2179.00 --> 2184.00]  So this is, this is already, like, seven, eight years ago, something like that, right?
[2184.00 --> 2185.00]  Okay.
[2185.00 --> 2188.00]  So, seven, eight years ago.
[2188.00 --> 2191.00]  I mean, would you have considered buying a CD?
[2191.00 --> 2198.00]  Would you have, would you have, would you have bought, you know, a programming book for dummies?
[2198.00 --> 2200.00]  Or would you just go on YouTube, right?
[2200.00 --> 2205.00]  Like, actually, the world was pretty similar to today, I think is pretty fair to say.
[2205.00 --> 2209.00]  Yeah, seven or eight years ago, I did have books for programming though.
[2209.00 --> 2211.00]  Yeah, but did you buy them?
[2211.00 --> 2212.00]  I did.
[2212.00 --> 2213.00]  Okay.
[2213.00 --> 2215.00]  I mean, did you buy them seven, eight years ago?
[2215.00 --> 2216.00]  Or did you just still own them?
[2216.00 --> 2217.00]  Oh, I still owned them.
[2217.00 --> 2218.00]  Okay, okay.
[2218.00 --> 2221.00]  It wasn't that long before that, but you are being specific, so okay, sounds good.
[2221.00 --> 2222.00]  Sure.
[2222.00 --> 2224.00]  And would you have considered buying a CD?
[2224.00 --> 2225.00]  Yeah, probably not.
[2225.00 --> 2226.00]  Okay.
[2226.00 --> 2227.00]  So.
[2227.00 --> 2230.00]  I technically, oh, and it's from the one person.
[2230.00 --> 2236.00]  No, I have, okay, I received a CD for Christmas around that exact amount of time ago, but it's
[2236.00 --> 2239.00]  from the one person that I just mentioned.
[2239.00 --> 2241.00]  All right.
[2241.00 --> 2244.00]  So let's go back to my high school reunion for a second here.
[2244.00 --> 2247.00]  I completely forgot about it, it's sitting in the glove box in my car.
[2247.00 --> 2251.00]  Probably between 60 and 100 people showed up.
[2251.00 --> 2252.00]  Pretty good turnout, actually.
[2252.00 --> 2253.00]  Oh, to high school reunion?
[2253.00 --> 2254.00]  Yeah, not bad.
[2254.00 --> 2255.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[2255.00 --> 2264.00]  And like, I didn't want to be like, you know, like, I didn't, if people asked what I was
[2264.00 --> 2269.00]  doing, I answered, but I wasn't going to walk up to people and be like, yeah, I'm like,
[2269.00 --> 2274.00]  you know, running a YouTube company, you know, I have a million subscribers or whatever.
[2274.00 --> 2277.00]  Like, I didn't, I didn't want it to be like that.
[2277.00 --> 2279.00]  It gets pretty douchey pretty fast when you start.
[2279.00 --> 2280.00]  Yeah.
[2280.00 --> 2284.00]  Like I just, I was, I went out of my way to say nothing.
[2284.00 --> 2287.00]  I would just ask people about themselves.
[2287.00 --> 2288.00]  That was it.
[2288.00 --> 2290.00]  That was like my rule for the night.
[2290.00 --> 2294.00]  Was there any intention of, of leading people to ask you the question or just no?
[2294.00 --> 2295.00]  Nope.
[2295.00 --> 2296.00]  Okay.
[2296.00 --> 2297.00]  Nope.
[2297.00 --> 2301.00]  No, I actually just didn't want it to be, cause it's, it's honestly weird for me when I, when
[2301.00 --> 2305.00]  I interact with people who I know otherwise.
[2305.00 --> 2309.00]  And all of a sudden they're like, Whoa, you're on YouTube.
[2309.00 --> 2311.00]  And then, and then that's all they want to talk about.
[2311.00 --> 2312.00]  Yep.
[2312.00 --> 2313.00]  I hate it.
[2313.00 --> 2316.00]  And what I actually wanted to talk about was like, how are you doing?
[2316.00 --> 2317.00]  Yeah.
[2317.00 --> 2321.00]  And like, remember that time, especially if you know them through like some, like say,
[2321.00 --> 2323.00]  say you met someone playing badminton.
[2323.00 --> 2324.00]  Sure.
[2324.00 --> 2325.00]  Yeah, exactly.
[2325.00 --> 2328.00]  Like you knew you as like a good badminton player that they liked playing against to
[2328.00 --> 2329.00]  test their skills or whatever.
[2329.00 --> 2330.00]  Sure.
[2330.00 --> 2332.00]  And then suddenly they figure it out.
[2332.00 --> 2335.00]  Now you're not the skilled badminton player.
[2335.00 --> 2337.00]  You're now the YouTuber.
[2337.00 --> 2338.00]  Yes.
[2338.00 --> 2340.00]  And it's like, and it changes the dynamic.
[2340.00 --> 2344.00]  And then they're going to ask me about, you know, YouTube and like, it doesn't really
[2344.00 --> 2345.00]  matter, but it changes the dynamic.
[2345.00 --> 2350.00]  Like you said, it shifts the, like, it's supposed to be about this thing that we did together.
[2350.00 --> 2352.00]  Not this other thing that I happened to do.
[2352.00 --> 2353.00]  Yes.
[2353.00 --> 2356.00]  So that was my, that was my, that was my whole jam.
[2356.00 --> 2366.00]  Um, however, I will say that at the end of the night, I was surprised that nobody knew.
[2366.00 --> 2368.00]  Not one.
[2368.00 --> 2373.00]  As in, so like, cause I'm assuming people asked you about what you do at some point.
[2373.00 --> 2374.00]  Yeah.
[2374.00 --> 2376.00]  But every single time they didn't know that you had done.
[2376.00 --> 2377.00]  Interesting.
[2377.00 --> 2378.00]  That's actually pretty surprising.
[2378.00 --> 2381.00]  Which, and if you, if you think about that, this is in, so this is.
[2381.00 --> 2382.00]  Yeah.
[2382.00 --> 2383.00]  Okay.
[2383.00 --> 2384.00]  That's the point you're trying to prove now.
[2384.00 --> 2387.00]  So I am, I am a well into the Linus media group era.
[2387.00 --> 2388.00]  Yeah.
[2388.00 --> 2389.00]  This is post NCIX.
[2389.00 --> 2390.00]  We're here already.
[2390.00 --> 2391.00]  Right?
[2391.00 --> 2392.00]  Uh, yeah.
[2392.00 --> 2393.00]  Yep.
[2393.00 --> 2394.00]  Just barely, but we are here.
[2394.00 --> 2395.00]  Just barely.
[2395.00 --> 2396.00]  Yeah.
[2396.00 --> 2397.00]  But we're, we're like in this building.
[2397.00 --> 2398.00]  We're like, we're popping off.
[2398.00 --> 2399.00]  Yeah.
[2399.00 --> 2401.00]  We're definitely full swing at that point.
[2401.00 --> 2407.00]  And not one of them out of, it was probably closer to a hundred people was like, oh yeah,
[2407.00 --> 2408.00]  I like know that.
[2408.00 --> 2412.00]  And I'm kind of sitting here going, huh.
[2412.00 --> 2413.00]  Huh.
[2413.00 --> 2416.00]  World's a little bigger maybe than I thought.
[2416.00 --> 2417.00]  And you know what?
[2417.00 --> 2421.00]  So, so, and it's like, it's the, it's the experience that I still have today.
[2421.00 --> 2424.00]  If I go to Best Buy, yeah, people know who I am.
[2424.00 --> 2425.00]  Right.
[2425.00 --> 2426.00]  It's context stuff.
[2426.00 --> 2428.00]  But I, okay.
[2428.00 --> 2434.00]  So for, for, for a shoot recently, we were, we were going around to, um, uh, we ended up
[2434.00 --> 2436.00]  using a farm as a location.
[2436.00 --> 2437.00]  Okay.
[2437.00 --> 2442.00]  And the, the, the people that worked there, one of the people that worked there made an
[2442.00 --> 2446.00]  offhand comment, like, yeah, I never really go on the internet.
[2446.00 --> 2447.00]  Nevermind.
[2447.00 --> 2450.00]  I don't know who you, a tech YouTuber are.
[2450.00 --> 2451.00]  Nevermind.
[2451.00 --> 2453.00]  I don't use YouTube.
[2453.00 --> 2455.00]  I don't go on the internet.
[2455.00 --> 2457.00]  That is a thing.
[2457.00 --> 2458.00]  Yeah.
[2458.00 --> 2459.00]  Not everybody lives on Reddit.
[2459.00 --> 2460.00]  Yeah.
[2460.00 --> 2462.00]  I've been trying to do less.
[2462.00 --> 2463.00]  It's been great.
[2463.00 --> 2464.00]  Actually.
[2464.00 --> 2466.00]  I'm saying that completely unironically.
[2466.00 --> 2468.00]  It's been, it's been better.
[2468.00 --> 2474.00]  Sometimes, sometimes I have to like recognize that the, the bubble that is the internet,
[2474.00 --> 2477.00]  as weird as that sounds to say, kind of sucks in some ways.
[2477.00 --> 2482.00]  It's fantastic in other ways, but like, you shouldn't necessarily be submerged in this
[2482.00 --> 2483.00]  all the time.
[2483.00 --> 2484.00]  No.
[2484.00 --> 2490.00]  Like there is a whole world out there of people who fax purchase orders and call each other
[2490.00 --> 2491.00]  on the telephone.
[2491.00 --> 2492.00]  And sometimes those things.
[2492.00 --> 2495.00]  And listen to music, plastic music discs.
[2495.00 --> 2496.00]  Yeah.
[2496.00 --> 2498.00]  It's, I know it's mind blowing, right?
[2498.00 --> 2499.00]  It's weird.
[2499.00 --> 2502.00]  It is a little mind blowing to me that people buy physical CDs still.
[2502.00 --> 2507.00]  I'm not going to lie that that's still blowing my mind a little bit, but I do, I do get it.
[2507.00 --> 2508.00]  And I kind of sympathize with it.
[2508.00 --> 2509.00]  I actually had the thought recently.
[2509.00 --> 2512.00]  I've talked a couple of times on my show about how I was doing this.
[2512.00 --> 2514.00]  There was a bunch of spring cleaning going on in my house.
[2514.00 --> 2515.00]  Yeah.
[2515.00 --> 2519.00]  And I did a bunch of archiving and like making sure all the hard drives that were on shelves
[2519.00 --> 2521.00]  were actually backed up properly and that kind of stuff.
[2521.00 --> 2523.00]  And I found my old like music folder.
[2523.00 --> 2524.00]  Nice.
[2524.00 --> 2529.00]  And I had the thought of like, you know, in like 10 years, Google music is going to forget
[2529.00 --> 2531.00]  that I listened to any of the stuff I'm listening to now.
[2531.00 --> 2534.00]  And I'm going to forget what it was called.
[2534.00 --> 2537.00]  Cause I don't remember the names of the songs.
[2537.00 --> 2538.00]  Yeah.
[2538.00 --> 2539.00]  You're very much like me that way.
[2539.00 --> 2540.00]  Just going to be gone.
[2540.00 --> 2541.00]  Yep.
[2541.00 --> 2546.00]  And if I want to go back and like reminisce everything I listened to in 2020.
[2546.00 --> 2552.00]  Cause like sometimes I'll get tired of songs or bands or whatever, but if I can remember
[2552.00 --> 2555.00]  the name going back a few years later, it's like, yeah, these are bangers.
[2555.00 --> 2556.00]  Fort minor.
[2556.00 --> 2557.00]  Fort minor.
[2557.00 --> 2558.00]  Is that a band?
[2558.00 --> 2562.00]  Oh, I thought you might get the reference.
[2562.00 --> 2565.00]  No, they have a, they have a, a fairly famous song.
[2565.00 --> 2566.00]  Remember the name.
[2566.00 --> 2567.00]  It doesn't matter.
[2567.00 --> 2568.00]  Okay.
[2568.00 --> 2569.00]  Carry on.
[2569.00 --> 2570.00]  Is this like a top 40 thing?
[2570.00 --> 2571.00]  No, no, not top 40.
[2571.00 --> 2573.00]  Oh, I'm actually surprised.
[2573.00 --> 2574.00]  Yeah.
[2574.00 --> 2575.00]  No, no, no.
[2575.00 --> 2576.00]  Yeah.
[2576.00 --> 2577.00]  Okay.
[2577.00 --> 2578.00]  Chat gets it.
[2578.00 --> 2579.00]  Luke doesn't know Fort minor.
[2579.00 --> 2580.00]  What?
[2580.00 --> 2581.00]  I, I don't know.
[2581.00 --> 2584.00]  My music tastes are 10% luck, 20% skill, 15%.
[2584.00 --> 2585.00]  Okay.
[2585.00 --> 2586.00]  That's the song.
[2586.00 --> 2587.00]  Oh, okay.
[2587.00 --> 2588.00]  I don't know names of this stuff.
[2588.00 --> 2589.00]  What?
[2589.00 --> 2590.00]  Okay.
[2590.00 --> 2591.00]  But you know the song, right?
[2591.00 --> 2592.00]  Yeah.
[2592.00 --> 2593.00]  Yeah.
[2593.00 --> 2594.00]  Okay.
[2594.00 --> 2595.00]  That's remember the name, but yeah, it doesn't matter.
[2595.00 --> 2596.00]  Okay.
[2596.00 --> 2597.00]  Yeah.
[2597.00 --> 2598.00]  Yeah.
[2598.00 --> 2599.00]  See, but the issue here is that I don't.
[2599.00 --> 2600.00]  Yeah.
[2600.00 --> 2601.00]  People will ask me about like actors or actresses.
[2601.00 --> 2603.00]  I have literally no idea who you're talking about.
[2603.00 --> 2605.00]  Then they'll be like this person in this film.
[2605.00 --> 2606.00]  I'll be like, oh, okay.
[2606.00 --> 2607.00]  Yeah.
[2607.00 --> 2608.00]  Yeah.
[2608.00 --> 2609.00]  Pretty hot.
[2609.00 --> 2610.00]  Yeah.
[2610.00 --> 2612.00]  I mean, it's George Clooney, right?
[2612.00 --> 2613.00]  Okay.
[2613.00 --> 2614.00]  That's good.
[2614.00 --> 2617.00]  I think of the guy who plays Thor, but I don't remember his name either.
[2617.00 --> 2618.00]  That's not George Clooney.
[2618.00 --> 2619.00]  No, I know.
[2619.00 --> 2621.00]  But that's, we both went the same kind of direction.
[2621.00 --> 2622.00]  Yeah.
[2622.00 --> 2623.00]  Okay.
[2623.00 --> 2624.00]  Yeah, sure.
[2624.00 --> 2625.00]  Yeah.
[2625.00 --> 2626.00]  Yeah.
[2626.00 --> 2627.00]  Yeah.
[2627.00 --> 2628.00]  Yeah.
[2628.00 --> 2629.00]  Yeah.
[2629.00 --> 2630.00]  Yeah.
[2630.00 --> 2631.00]  Yeah.
[2631.00 --> 2632.00]  Yeah.
[2632.00 --> 2635.00]  Maybe we should, maybe we should move on Dan.
[2635.00 --> 2636.00]  All right.
[2636.00 --> 2642.00]  Now's the point in the show where we tell you guys the way to message in is not to send a
[2642.00 --> 2644.00]  super chat over on YouTube.
[2644.00 --> 2645.00]  Um, oh wow.
[2645.00 --> 2646.00]  Yeah.
[2646.00 --> 2651.00]  Most of you are like, oh, that's see, see, like once again, people, people, I saw, I was
[2651.00 --> 2657.00]  called out on Reddit again recently for lying about YouTube super chats being broken.
[2657.00 --> 2660.00]  Blah, blah, lying, blah, blah, blah.
[2660.00 --> 2661.00]  Blah, blah, blah.
[2661.00 --> 2662.00]  No, they're just broken.
[2662.00 --> 2664.00]  Here are some super chats.
[2664.00 --> 2668.00]  Google has, here is me not being able to read them.
[2668.00 --> 2669.00]  Sweet.
[2669.00 --> 2671.00]  Um, yeah.
[2671.00 --> 2677.00]  So sorry to, I mean, even if, even if, even if they weren't broken, we don't want to use
[2677.00 --> 2678.00]  them anyways.
[2678.00 --> 2681.00]  Anyway, the way to write into the show is not super chats, not Twitch bits.
[2681.00 --> 2683.00]  It's merch messages.
[2683.00 --> 2688.00]  So if you head over to LTT store.com in the checkout, there'll be a field for a merch message.
[2688.00 --> 2690.00]  It'll go to our producer, Dan.
[2690.00 --> 2691.00]  Beep, beep.
[2691.00 --> 2692.00]  There he is.
[2692.00 --> 2693.00]  Nope.
[2693.00 --> 2694.00]  Oh, sorry.
[2694.00 --> 2695.00]  I missed the wave.
[2695.00 --> 2696.00]  Sorry.
[2696.00 --> 2697.00]  I missed it again.
[2697.00 --> 2698.00]  Nope.
[2698.00 --> 2699.00]  Missed it.
[2699.00 --> 2700.00]  All right, cool.
[2700.00 --> 2703.00]  It'll go to our producer, Dan, uh, who will either curate it to pop up here or curate
[2703.00 --> 2706.00]  it for us to talk about, or he'll reply to you.
[2706.00 --> 2707.00]  Super cool.
[2707.00 --> 2711.00]  And if we don't do any of that stuff, then hey, at least you get your order in the mail,
[2711.00 --> 2713.00]  get some high quality merchandise.
[2713.00 --> 2717.00]  I do think we have a couple LTT store things to talk about this week.
[2717.00 --> 2718.00]  Holy crap.
[2718.00 --> 2719.00]  Okay.
[2719.00 --> 2720.00]  Yeah.
[2720.00 --> 2725.00]  We finally have a mystery waffle skew.
[2725.00 --> 2728.00]  Um, that'll be more clear what exactly it is.
[2728.00 --> 2733.00]  Once I have the site up, if you like the waffle shirt, but you don't care what color you get,
[2733.00 --> 2738.00]  you can get a mystery waffle long sleeve at a discount and check this out.
[2738.00 --> 2740.00]  Oh, we're selling rack studs.
[2740.00 --> 2741.00]  Rack studs.
[2741.00 --> 2742.00]  Rack studs.
[2742.00 --> 2748.00]  So you can pick up a super comfy waffle shirt and also some rack studs.
[2748.00 --> 2749.00]  These are awesome.
[2749.00 --> 2751.00]  You can install those rack studs in your new shirt.
[2751.00 --> 2757.00]  These are so much better than traditional, um, man, I forget what this cage nuts.
[2757.00 --> 2758.00]  That's what they're called.
[2758.00 --> 2759.00]  So they're plastic.
[2759.00 --> 2762.00]  They're super quick to install.
[2762.00 --> 2766.00]  Uh, you don't have to have any tools or fight with them to get them in and out of the
[2766.00 --> 2768.00]  rack.
[2768.00 --> 2769.00]  Um, and they are shockingly strong.
[2769.00 --> 2773.00]  So we are, we are an official reseller of rack studs.
[2773.00 --> 2778.00]  They had a whole issue where we did a video recently where we featured the product and because
[2778.00 --> 2786.00]  of some of the complications around working with sellers, like big sellers that until recently
[2786.00 --> 2792.00]  were run by bald people, um, nothing against bald people, love bald people.
[2792.00 --> 2793.00]  Yeah.
[2793.00 --> 2797.00]  Um, but just, you know, that, that particular seller can be pretty challenging to deal with.
[2797.00 --> 2798.00]  They're not all the same.
[2798.00 --> 2801.00]  Um, what happened was they got, they went out of stock like immediately after we called
[2801.00 --> 2805.00]  them out in the video and they had no way to refill their stock.
[2805.00 --> 2809.00]  So they just completely lost the benefit of the wave of traffic that we sent at them.
[2809.00 --> 2811.00]  Cause we were like, yo, these things are super cool.
[2811.00 --> 2812.00]  You should buy some.
[2812.00 --> 2818.00]  And then they just went, no, um, so the solution is that we're just going to carry them.
[2818.00 --> 2819.00]  Nice.
[2819.00 --> 2820.00]  Nice.
[2820.00 --> 2821.00]  Perfect.
[2821.00 --> 2822.00]  Nice.
[2822.00 --> 2823.00]  Rack studs.
[2823.00 --> 2827.00]  So we've got the duo and then we've also got the, I don't know.
[2827.00 --> 2831.00]  I guess it's called the series two rack studs series two.
[2831.00 --> 2832.00]  I think.
[2832.00 --> 2833.00]  Yeah, sure.
[2833.00 --> 2834.00]  Cool.
[2834.00 --> 2835.00]  So check them out.
[2835.00 --> 2837.00]  I actually have a bunch of rack studs at my house that are like the wrong one.
[2837.00 --> 2838.00]  I need to get some rack studs.
[2838.00 --> 2841.00]  So I'm going to have to like get all the wording around all of this is just amazing.
[2841.00 --> 2842.00]  Oh, sorry.
[2842.00 --> 2843.00]  I guess I'm yeah.
[2843.00 --> 2846.00]  So different thicknesses, uh, different pack sizes.
[2846.00 --> 2850.00]  So you can add those to your cart and say goodbye to cage nuts.
[2850.00 --> 2851.00]  This is super cool.
[2851.00 --> 2858.00]  Oh, for those of you who are wondering, we are still working on that like phase change thermal pad thing.
[2858.00 --> 2860.00]  I believe we've found a supplier.
[2860.00 --> 2864.00]  And then the only challenge is that they come in sheets that are like this big.
[2864.00 --> 2865.00]  Right.
[2865.00 --> 2869.00]  And those are, I don't think most people are going to spend hundreds of dollars on like
[2869.00 --> 2870.00]  a giant sheet of it.
[2870.00 --> 2875.00]  I mean, someone will, is that what you would not want?
[2875.00 --> 2876.00]  Yeah.
[2876.00 --> 2877.00]  Not many people.
[2877.00 --> 2878.00]  Yeah.
[2878.00 --> 2882.00]  So what we're trying to figure out because it's a Honeywell product, right?
[2882.00 --> 2884.00]  Honeywell doesn't give two shits about us.
[2884.00 --> 2889.00]  We're they're not, if we're like, Hey, um, so that's a really big sheet.
[2889.00 --> 2893.00]  Could you, could you retool your thing to make a smaller sheet?
[2893.00 --> 2894.00]  Um, that'd be great.
[2894.00 --> 2895.00]  Thanks.
[2895.00 --> 2899.00]  They didn't even reply to our emails, like our outreach emails.
[2899.00 --> 2901.00]  We're in touch with the distributor now though.
[2901.00 --> 2902.00]  Oh boy.
[2902.00 --> 2906.00]  So we're just trying to figure out a, um, the order quantity.
[2906.00 --> 2911.00]  Cause it's like, it's not cheap and B how to package and sell these things.
[2911.00 --> 2914.00]  But that is going to come to LTT store as well.
[2914.00 --> 2922.00]  I also have an update for you guys on the carabiner situation for the LTT backpack.
[2922.00 --> 2926.00]  Dan, could I trouble you to man the camera?
[2926.00 --> 2927.00]  Manra.
[2927.00 --> 2928.00]  Danra?
[2928.00 --> 2929.00]  Kamandra.
[2929.00 --> 2930.00]  Okay.
[2930.00 --> 2931.00]  Okay.
[2931.00 --> 2937.00]  I actually don't remember exactly what the last update we gave you guys was, but this
[2937.00 --> 2940.00]  is definitely new stuff.
[2940.00 --> 2943.00]  So Luke, you're going to be my test monkey.
[2943.00 --> 2944.00]  Yeah.
[2944.00 --> 2945.00]  Yes.
[2945.00 --> 2946.00]  It's going to be exciting.
[2946.00 --> 2947.00]  Okay.
[2947.00 --> 2949.00]  In front of you is Dan.
[2949.00 --> 2950.00]  You got this.
[2950.00 --> 2951.00]  I believe.
[2951.00 --> 2952.00]  Okay.
[2952.00 --> 2953.00]  You might want to give her, give her a little more zoom.
[2953.00 --> 2954.00]  We're, we're on Luke's hands here.
[2954.00 --> 2955.00]  All right, cool.
[2955.00 --> 2959.00]  So you're going to be our test monkey in front of you is a zipper.
[2959.00 --> 2964.00]  That's a, that's one of the flawed, uh, carabiner designs that we are, we are recalling.
[2964.00 --> 2967.00]  So this one's still in good condition, but I'm assuming that I am a person who wants to
[2967.00 --> 2968.00]  swap it anyways.
[2968.00 --> 2969.00]  Yes.
[2969.00 --> 2971.00]  Because you are, you don't like that.
[2971.00 --> 2977.00]  It might fail at some point in your hands is the tool for removing it, safely removing
[2977.00 --> 2978.00]  it.
[2978.00 --> 2979.00]  This thing.
[2979.00 --> 2980.00]  Yep.
[2980.00 --> 2989.00]  The goal was to create a tool set and instructions that pretty much are, um, brain dead simple.
[2989.00 --> 2993.00]  Like you, you can't break the zipper by changing out the pull.
[2993.00 --> 2995.00]  I want to make this very clear.
[2995.00 --> 2998.00]  It is not designed for you to just.
[2998.00 --> 2999.00]  No.
[2999.00 --> 3001.00]  Fashionably change your zipper pulls all the time.
[3001.00 --> 3002.00]  You can do this like once.
[3002.00 --> 3003.00]  Once.
[3003.00 --> 3006.00]  That is the number, that is the number of times to do this.
[3006.00 --> 3007.00]  All right.
[3007.00 --> 3008.00]  Back to the loop cam.
[3008.00 --> 3011.00]  So can you figure out how to use that tool to change?
[3011.00 --> 3013.00]  So I don't get the instructions.
[3013.00 --> 3014.00]  Yeah.
[3014.00 --> 3016.00]  I'm just, I just want to see if you can figure it out.
[3016.00 --> 3017.00]  Yeah.
[3017.00 --> 3018.00]  Test monkey.
[3020.00 --> 3021.00]  Okay.
[3021.00 --> 3025.00]  Well, I think the tool goes in there because you can see on the actual zipper bit.
[3025.00 --> 3028.00]  I saw Tynan do this, but I honestly wasn't paying that much attention.
[3028.00 --> 3033.00]  Um, there's like a part where it doesn't fully connect in here.
[3033.00 --> 3036.00]  So I'm going to try to lift that up.
[3036.00 --> 3038.00]  I just bent something.
[3038.00 --> 3039.00]  I bent it back though.
[3039.00 --> 3040.00]  It's okay.
[3040.00 --> 3042.00]  Oh, good.
[3044.00 --> 3046.00]  I'm not a hundred percent sure how this goes.
[3046.00 --> 3047.00]  Maybe it's like this.
[3047.00 --> 3048.00]  No.
[3048.00 --> 3050.00]  Tynan is screaming right now.
[3050.00 --> 3051.00]  Oh, I'm sure.
[3051.00 --> 3053.00]  Why don't you just tell me what to do?
[3053.00 --> 3054.00]  No.
[3054.00 --> 3055.00]  Tynan is saying no hints at all.
[3055.00 --> 3056.00]  No hints at all.
[3056.00 --> 3057.00]  Why?
[3057.00 --> 3058.00]  That's hilarious.
[3058.00 --> 3059.00]  Okay.
[3059.00 --> 3060.00]  Did I just do it?
[3060.00 --> 3062.00]  I might've just done it.
[3062.00 --> 3063.00]  Yes.
[3063.00 --> 3066.00]  Oh, I think I was done immediately and just didn't realize it.
[3066.00 --> 3067.00]  I should have tested it.
[3067.00 --> 3070.00]  So all I had to do was put the tool in and then turn it.
[3070.00 --> 3072.00]  And it was, uh, Dan, you can stay close.
[3072.00 --> 3074.00]  I'll go back to the, it was just actually so easy to do that.
[3074.00 --> 3076.00]  I don't think I realized it was done.
[3076.00 --> 3077.00]  Yeah.
[3077.00 --> 3082.00]  So the idea was that we wanted these tools to be small and inexpensive enough that we
[3082.00 --> 3088.00]  could ship them to tens of thousands of people, um, without wasting any more materials than
[3088.00 --> 3089.00]  we absolutely have to.
[3089.00 --> 3092.00]  And while making it quick enough that it can be user serviceable.
[3092.00 --> 3093.00]  That was very easy.
[3093.00 --> 3095.00]  And then to, to put it back on.
[3095.00 --> 3101.00]  So, so the removal tool is pretty much final because it's basically just a little Allen key.
[3101.00 --> 3104.00]  It's a bent thing and you turn it once and then you're done.
[3104.00 --> 3108.00]  The re, uh, tightening tool that clearly is told.
[3108.00 --> 3111.00]  This is not final cause it's way too big.
[3111.00 --> 3112.00]  Yes.
[3112.00 --> 3113.00]  And expensive.
[3113.00 --> 3114.00]  Yeah.
[3114.00 --> 3115.00]  And so we need to kind of solve that.
[3115.00 --> 3120.00]  So then I'm going to put the new zipper, which like looks all actually super cool and
[3120.00 --> 3121.00]  stuff.
[3121.00 --> 3122.00]  Maybe we'll get a zoom in later.
[3122.00 --> 3126.00]  Um, I'm going to put it on, which is easy enough now.
[3126.00 --> 3129.00]  And then I'm assuming you just mash.
[3129.00 --> 3133.00]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[3133.00 --> 3134.00]  I might have done it.
[3134.00 --> 3135.00]  I might have done it.
[3138.00 --> 3139.00]  Yeah.
[3139.00 --> 3140.00]  Cool.
[3140.00 --> 3141.00]  Okay.
[3141.00 --> 3142.00]  So that's the process.
[3142.00 --> 3144.00]  Um, seems to work.
[3144.00 --> 3148.00]  Well, we're still working on, on a, on a, on an inexpensive way.
[3148.00 --> 3151.00]  I was actually inspired by Der Bauer's de-lidding tools.
[3151.00 --> 3157.00]  And I've asked the guys to explore some kind of, maybe you could take the key that you used
[3157.00 --> 3158.00]  to remove it.
[3158.00 --> 3163.00]  And you could use that to tighten a thing that sits like a little injection molded plastic
[3163.00 --> 3168.00]  thing that sits over top of the zipper and it would press it shut or something like that.
[3168.00 --> 3169.00]  Um, so that's a possibility.
[3169.00 --> 3172.00]  They're exploring that they've got a couple of other ideas as well.
[3172.00 --> 3177.00]  Is it like super unprofessional to just ask people to like, Oh no, cause you wouldn't
[3177.00 --> 3178.00]  have this strip.
[3178.00 --> 3179.00]  It would be attached to the bag.
[3179.00 --> 3180.00]  Yes.
[3180.00 --> 3183.00]  And the challenge with that is that we don't want people to scuff the finish.
[3183.00 --> 3184.00]  Right.
[3184.00 --> 3187.00]  So I could tell them, yeah, just grab a pair of needle nose pliers and go to town and that
[3187.00 --> 3189.00]  would work, but that sucks.
[3189.00 --> 3190.00]  Right.
[3190.00 --> 3191.00]  That's not a good user experience.
[3191.00 --> 3194.00]  And the reality is that most of these haven't failed in the field.
[3194.00 --> 3195.00]  Yeah.
[3195.00 --> 3198.00]  There's some, there's some manufacturing tolerances.
[3198.00 --> 3200.00]  Some of them are really bad and fail like immediately.
[3200.00 --> 3201.00]  Very few.
[3201.00 --> 3203.00]  Most of them are still fine.
[3203.00 --> 3204.00]  So we've got time.
[3204.00 --> 3209.00]  We've got time for, to figure this out and create a system that's pretty good.
[3209.00 --> 3210.00]  Yeah.
[3210.00 --> 3213.00]  So let's take a closer look at some of our, whoopsy daisies.
[3213.00 --> 3214.00]  There we go.
[3214.00 --> 3216.00]  Let's take a closer look at some of our options here.
[3216.00 --> 3220.00]  That's a one of our replacement carabiner options.
[3220.00 --> 3221.00]  It's a titanium.
[3221.00 --> 3223.00]  The cost is not low.
[3223.00 --> 3224.00]  Yeah.
[3224.00 --> 3225.00]  Yeah.
[3225.00 --> 3228.00]  But if you play around with it, it has no moving parts.
[3228.00 --> 3231.00]  So it has just like a, yeah, there you go.
[3231.00 --> 3232.00]  It has just like this.
[3232.00 --> 3233.00]  Man, is that all the zoom we got?
[3233.00 --> 3234.00]  Here.
[3234.00 --> 3236.00]  It's not like a pin on a hinge.
[3236.00 --> 3238.00]  It's actually just how it's like, I mean.
[3238.00 --> 3239.00]  Yeah.
[3239.00 --> 3240.00]  I'm just trying to get this a little closer to Dan.
[3240.00 --> 3241.00]  Is this, is this going to work?
[3241.00 --> 3242.00]  Maybe.
[3242.00 --> 3243.00]  So we've got like this, um.
[3243.00 --> 3244.00]  Yeah.
[3244.00 --> 3245.00]  That's.
[3245.00 --> 3249.00]  I don't know how to describe this, but it's like not ribbed, but it's kind of cut on both
[3249.00 --> 3250.00]  sides.
[3250.00 --> 3251.00]  Yeah.
[3251.00 --> 3252.00]  Dan's calling it herringbone.
[3252.00 --> 3253.00]  I don't know.
[3253.00 --> 3255.00]  The point is that it makes it more likely to bend in that spot.
[3255.00 --> 3258.00]  And the reality of it is that it's going to bend.
[3258.00 --> 3263.00]  Like I could, I could, I could bend this wrong or whatever, but it's titanium.
[3263.00 --> 3268.00]  Um, and so as long as I'm not a complete idiot and doing it all the time, I could bend it
[3268.00 --> 3271.00]  back and it's going to have some like maximum tolerance.
[3271.00 --> 3276.00]  Cause like everything does, but you just saw him bend it quite a bit out of position and
[3276.00 --> 3277.00]  it just went right back.
[3277.00 --> 3278.00]  Yeah.
[3278.00 --> 3280.00]  So just be like, not a big dumb, dumb, and we should be fine.
[3280.00 --> 3285.00]  Uh, one thing that we're going to change if we go ahead with this particular design is
[3285.00 --> 3287.00]  right now they're quite tall compared to the original ones.
[3287.00 --> 3290.00]  We're going to try and shorten it a little bit to get it more in line with the original
[3290.00 --> 3291.00]  carabiners.
[3291.00 --> 3298.00]  Now we're not necessarily settled on this exact configuration and color and Tynan has
[3298.00 --> 3299.00]  actually been playing around.
[3299.00 --> 3304.00]  So let's go back to Luke with some, like, I don't know what he's doing with these things,
[3304.00 --> 3307.00]  but he managed to color them.
[3307.00 --> 3308.00]  Yeah.
[3308.00 --> 3310.00]  So he's anodizing them.
[3310.00 --> 3311.00]  Okay.
[3311.00 --> 3317.00]  So, so these are, these are, this is, uh, that sounds a lot more like play than work.
[3317.00 --> 3321.00]  Um, this is called the stone wash anodizing test.
[3321.00 --> 3322.00]  Okay.
[3322.00 --> 3323.00]  I think they look amazing to be completely honest.
[3323.00 --> 3324.00]  I think that looks super cool.
[3324.00 --> 3327.00]  It doesn't really match the black bag, but maybe for like a future version of the bag.
[3327.00 --> 3328.00]  No, I think it kind of could though.
[3328.00 --> 3330.00]  Cause basically everything matches black.
[3330.00 --> 3335.00]  And then if you got a series of similarly colored ones, which he does have, like if I wanted,
[3335.00 --> 3338.00]  okay, I want the accent theme of my bag to be.
[3338.00 --> 3340.00]  Dan, don't forget that there's a lower third.
[3340.00 --> 3341.00]  So you got to go a little lower.
[3341.00 --> 3345.00]  If I wanted the accent theme of my bag to be purple, I could go with these.
[3345.00 --> 3346.00]  These are all purple.
[3346.00 --> 3347.00]  Yeah.
[3347.00 --> 3348.00]  Look at the purple and black.
[3348.00 --> 3349.00]  Okay.
[3349.00 --> 3351.00]  Well, I, I'm not promising that we're going to do any kinds of options like that.
[3351.00 --> 3352.00]  Oh.
[3352.00 --> 3354.00]  Remember, these are a warranty replacement part.
[3354.00 --> 3355.00]  These are not.
[3355.00 --> 3356.00]  Oh yeah.
[3356.00 --> 3359.00]  No, this would have to be, there's no way we're anodizing.
[3359.00 --> 3360.00]  Okay.
[3360.00 --> 3361.00]  The free ones are sending out.
[3361.00 --> 3362.00]  Well, I don't know.
[3362.00 --> 3363.00]  That's why I'm saying, I don't know why he's testing.
[3363.00 --> 3364.00]  I don't know.
[3364.00 --> 3367.00]  Stuff just gets like left here and then we're supposed to talk about.
[3367.00 --> 3368.00]  Okay.
[3368.00 --> 3369.00]  Well, what else is there for us to show?
[3369.00 --> 3372.00]  There is also the shiny anodized ones.
[3372.00 --> 3373.00]  Okay.
[3373.00 --> 3375.00]  We can, I'm kind of particular to the stonewash.
[3375.00 --> 3376.00]  Uh, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.
[3376.00 --> 3379.00]  But the shiny ones are quite cool as well.
[3379.00 --> 3380.00]  Yeah.
[3380.00 --> 3381.00]  Those shiny ones are pretty sick.
[3381.00 --> 3384.00]  Oh, why do I keep clicking the wrong thing here?
[3384.00 --> 3385.00]  Yeah.
[3385.00 --> 3386.00]  There we go.
[3386.00 --> 3387.00]  Yeah.
[3387.00 --> 3388.00]  Those are pretty sick.
[3388.00 --> 3391.00]  If we could get shiny and not colorful, I think that would probably be the way that
[3391.00 --> 3394.00]  we'd go on just the stock standard ones.
[3394.00 --> 3396.00]  You don't, you don't like that finish?
[3396.00 --> 3397.00]  Uh, it's okay.
[3397.00 --> 3401.00]  I'd like to go a little shinier than this if I can, cause I want to get pretty close to
[3401.00 --> 3402.00]  the original, right?
[3402.00 --> 3404.00]  Like the idea is that they bought a particular thing.
[3404.00 --> 3406.00]  It's the original one pretty shiny.
[3406.00 --> 3409.00]  I'm expecting that it would be like that and then it's not like that anymore.
[3409.00 --> 3410.00]  Okay.
[3410.00 --> 3411.00]  Yeah.
[3411.00 --> 3412.00]  They're pretty similar.
[3412.00 --> 3413.00]  Well, we're getting there.
[3413.00 --> 3414.00]  We're getting there.
[3414.00 --> 3415.00]  The point is that this is an update.
[3415.00 --> 3420.00]  For those of you who have the backpack, we're actually making a lot of progress even
[3420.00 --> 3423.00]  though it must feel very, very slow.
[3423.00 --> 3424.00]  Product development.
[3424.00 --> 3425.00]  Yeah.
[3425.00 --> 3426.00]  All right.
[3426.00 --> 3427.00]  Thanks, Dan.
[3427.00 --> 3428.00]  I think that's good.
[3428.00 --> 3429.00]  Okay.
[3429.00 --> 3433.00]  Uh, people are asking if we would sell these independently.
[3433.00 --> 3434.00]  Well, that's what I was saying.
[3434.00 --> 3435.00]  If you, that's...
[3435.00 --> 3436.00]  No.
[3436.00 --> 3437.00]  Okay.
[3437.00 --> 3440.00]  And the reason is that we don't want people opening up the zipper.
[3440.00 --> 3441.00]  It's not designed for that.
[3441.00 --> 3445.00]  Oh, but like Dan was talking about using one on his jacket or something.
[3445.00 --> 3447.00]  Like you wouldn't have to sell these for the LTT bag.
[3447.00 --> 3451.00]  Yeah, but people would put it on the LTT bag and then they would break the LTT bag.
[3451.00 --> 3455.00]  And then that's my problem now.
[3455.00 --> 3458.00]  Because they wouldn't tell me they broke the LTT bag.
[3458.00 --> 3460.00]  They would tell me it just broke.
[3460.00 --> 3462.00]  So, I don't know.
[3462.00 --> 3463.00]  I don't know.
[3463.00 --> 3467.00]  Their customer account would have an order for new zippers on it.
[3467.00 --> 3470.00]  Aren't new backpacks shipping with the new zippers?
[3470.00 --> 3471.00]  Uh, not yet.
[3471.00 --> 3472.00]  Oh.
[3472.00 --> 3473.00]  So, we're still developing.
[3473.00 --> 3475.00]  I mean, that's um...
[3475.00 --> 3476.00]  If we made...
[3476.00 --> 3479.00]  So, my issue here is that if we made it too cool...
[3480.00 --> 3484.00]  Like, it's not the kind of thing where we're gonna do like a Stonewash series.
[3484.00 --> 3486.00]  And then we're gonna do like a Shiny series.
[3486.00 --> 3488.00]  And then we're gonna do a whale version.
[3488.00 --> 3491.00]  Because I don't want people swapping out the bloody zippers on their bag all the time.
[3491.00 --> 3495.00]  Dude, whale blue zippers though would be so sick.
[3495.00 --> 3500.00]  Yeah, and I mean like the anodized ones you have there...
[3500.00 --> 3502.00]  You gotta win orange zippers!
[3502.00 --> 3503.00]  Yeah!
[3503.00 --> 3505.00]  I mean those ones technically are like hand anodized.
[3505.00 --> 3506.00]  So, they're like artisanal...
[3506.00 --> 3507.00]  Super fun rainbow zippers?
[3507.00 --> 3509.00]  Artisanal rainbow zippers.
[3509.00 --> 3510.00]  And...
[3510.00 --> 3511.00]  They sell themselves.
[3511.00 --> 3518.00]  And what's really cool is that because we're developing these tools, this little kit for YKK zippers...
[3519.00 --> 3522.00]  Yeah, nothing would prevent you from like putting a cool carabiner pole on your...
[3522.00 --> 3524.00]  Why don't you wanna sell these?!
[3524.00 --> 3525.00]  Because...
[3525.00 --> 3526.00]  That's sweet!
[3526.00 --> 3528.00]  Because there's a huge liability!
[3528.00 --> 3532.00]  Yeah, okay, there's huge liabilities in like repairing things...
[3532.00 --> 3533.00]  And you're pro repair.
[3533.00 --> 3534.00]  Yeah, but I'm not a repair business!
[3534.00 --> 3535.00]  Are you anti-modification now?
[3535.00 --> 3536.00]  Yeah, but I'm not a repair business!
[3536.00 --> 3543.00]  I'm talking to the same person who painted a heatsink on a motherboard and wrote along the traces with UV ink on his graphics card.
[3543.00 --> 3546.00]  And now you don't want people to be able to do user replaceable zippers?
[3546.00 --> 3547.00]  No, I'm not saying that!
[3547.00 --> 3548.00]  Where is this coming from, bro?!
[3548.00 --> 3549.00]  That was my GPU!
[3549.00 --> 3550.00]  And I'm more than...
[3550.00 --> 3551.00]  And this is their bag!
[3551.00 --> 3552.00]  Yeah, right!
[3552.00 --> 3556.00]  But then if they come back to me and say, well, it's broken now, lol...
[3556.00 --> 3559.00]  Yeah, if you went back to GPU manufacturing and said, well, it's broken now lol...
[3559.00 --> 3562.00]  Yeah, well, then I shouldn't do that, right?
[3562.00 --> 3563.00]  Yeah, maybe it voids your warranty!
[3563.00 --> 3564.00]  Well, yeah!
[3564.00 --> 3565.00]  Okay!
[3565.00 --> 3569.00]  But yeah, but I'm not gonna be the provider of a product that voids your bloody warranty!
[3569.00 --> 3571.00]  That doesn't seem very smart!
[3571.00 --> 3572.00]  Why not?
[3572.00 --> 3574.00]  Well, because it's a first party product!
[3574.00 --> 3579.00]  If Apple sold a case for the iPhone that voided your f***ing iPhone warranty, we'd rip them apart!
[3579.00 --> 3585.00]  If Apple sold a case for the iPhone that you could swap out the back and it went into like...
[3585.00 --> 3588.00]  What is that N64 model, the translucent purple one?
[3588.00 --> 3590.00]  It has like a specific name.
[3590.00 --> 3591.00]  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[3591.00 --> 3592.00]  If it was...
[3592.00 --> 3593.00]  That would be sick!
[3593.00 --> 3595.00]  Yeah, but Apple's never gonna do that!
[3595.00 --> 3596.00]  Yeah, because Apple's lame!
[3596.00 --> 3597.00]  Oh...
[3605.00 --> 3606.00]  Yeah, well, okay...
[3606.00 --> 3610.00]  They would also like cost way too much.
[3611.00 --> 3612.00]  I mean...
[3612.00 --> 3613.00]  I think they would cost a lot.
[3613.00 --> 3614.00]  We could do a kit for like 20 bucks.
[3614.00 --> 3615.00]  With zippers?
[3616.00 --> 3617.00]  With zippers?
[3617.00 --> 3618.00]  No, with the poles, yeah.
[3618.00 --> 3619.00]  With like four poles.
[3619.00 --> 3621.00]  Ah, four poles is a lot.
[3621.00 --> 3623.00]  We could do two poles for like $14.99.
[3623.00 --> 3624.00]  Oh, oh, oh!
[3624.00 --> 3625.00]  This is a pole, not a zipper.
[3625.00 --> 3626.00]  That's a zipper pole.
[3626.00 --> 3627.00]  Okay, yeah, yeah.
[3627.00 --> 3628.00]  Sorry.
[3628.00 --> 3630.00]  So you'd have four poles and the kit.
[3630.00 --> 3632.00]  Would you be able to buy them without the kit?
[3632.00 --> 3635.00]  Like say you bought a kit and you're like,
[3635.00 --> 3638.00]  well, I don't need this tool and this tool again
[3638.00 --> 3639.00]  because I already have them.
[3639.00 --> 3642.00]  I'd say probably not because the cost of the tools
[3642.00 --> 3645.00]  is going to be so negligible and the cost of maintaining
[3645.00 --> 3646.00]  separate SKUs.
[3646.00 --> 3647.00]  Multiple SKUs.
[3647.00 --> 3648.00]  Yeah, I...
[3648.00 --> 3651.00]  Well, with that said, we're actually working on a system,
[3651.00 --> 3653.00]  which you know, we're working on a system where people
[3653.00 --> 3657.00]  will be able to buy individual bits and create their own pack.
[3657.00 --> 3660.00]  So we're working on a price break system where if you buy 10 bits,
[3660.00 --> 3661.00]  20 or 50, I think it is.
[3661.00 --> 3663.00]  I can't remember what the exact price breaks are.
[3663.00 --> 3664.00]  I think that's correct.
[3664.00 --> 3666.00]  But you can just mix and match and build your own kit.
[3666.00 --> 3670.00]  And then we're working on with our distribution partner,
[3670.00 --> 3673.00]  the ability for them to create these custom kits,
[3673.00 --> 3674.00]  hopefully without too many errors.
[3674.00 --> 3676.00]  Oh, we're going to see how it goes.
[3676.00 --> 3678.00]  We might just backtrack on the whole thing.
[3678.00 --> 3683.00]  Would you ever consider releasing a product like a backpack?
[3683.00 --> 3685.00]  I'm not going to do the poll because you're all going to agree with me
[3685.00 --> 3687.00]  and it's actually not really like fair.
[3687.00 --> 3693.00]  So you're saying I'm so unpopular that it is unfair to poll.
[3693.00 --> 3697.00]  What I'm saying is that people are always going to vote this way
[3697.00 --> 3700.00]  because they're not going to carry your concerns.
[3700.00 --> 3703.00]  So I'm trying to actually defend your argument here.
[3703.00 --> 3704.00]  All right. Well, thank you.
[3704.00 --> 3705.00]  I appreciate that.
[3705.00 --> 3707.00]  Because up until now, you've been very unhelpful.
[3707.00 --> 3711.00]  What was I going to say?
[3711.00 --> 3717.00]  Would you consider releasing a backpack with swappable zippers in mind?
[3720.00 --> 3721.00]  That would hurt.
[3721.00 --> 3723.00]  Okay. You probably couldn't go with YKK then, I guess.
[3723.00 --> 3724.00]  Right. Exactly.
[3724.00 --> 3725.00]  And that's why we wouldn't do it.
[3725.00 --> 3726.00]  That's fair.
[3726.00 --> 3730.00]  It's one of those things where even if there was a zipper brand
[3730.00 --> 3736.00]  that was as good as YKK, one of our things you can rely on
[3736.00 --> 3742.00]  is that when you buy a product from us, unless there is, unless they offer absolutely no option,
[3742.00 --> 3744.00]  which I don't know that we've ever run into.
[3744.00 --> 3745.00]  They offer a lot of options.
[3745.00 --> 3746.00]  Yeah.
[3746.00 --> 3747.00]  We use YKK zippers.
[3747.00 --> 3748.00]  Yeah.
[3748.00 --> 3749.00]  Which are they the best?
[3749.00 --> 3752.00]  I don't know. Maybe not necessarily, but what they are is consistent.
[3752.00 --> 3753.00]  Very consistent.
[3753.00 --> 3754.00]  Pretty darn okay.
[3754.00 --> 3758.00]  Every product I've had that has had a YKK zipper on it, the zipper's never broke.
[3759.00 --> 3763.00]  So, I don't want to break that up.
[3764.00 --> 3767.00]  I don't need that disruption in that messaging.
[3767.00 --> 3768.00]  Yeah, it is.
[3768.00 --> 3769.00]  That seems pretty fair to me.
[3769.00 --> 3770.00]  Yeah.
[3770.00 --> 3773.00]  It's that we just don't f*** around, right?
[3773.00 --> 3774.00]  I'm not doing a poll.
[3774.00 --> 3775.00]  I already told you guys why.
[3775.00 --> 3776.00]  I'm not doing a poll.
[3776.00 --> 3777.00]  No, we're not going to do it.
[3777.00 --> 3781.00]  We're just going to keep using YKK zippers and we'll do our best with it.
[3781.00 --> 3786.00]  Now, the reason we were able to do custom pulls in the first place is because the zipper itself
[3786.00 --> 3787.00]  doesn't necessarily have the pull.
[3787.00 --> 3789.00]  You can bend it into place once.
[3789.00 --> 3791.00]  It is designed for that, but that's supposed to be one time.
[3791.00 --> 3794.00]  You're not supposed to bend it back and then back and back and back and back and back.
[3794.00 --> 3799.00]  So, encouraging people to do that, I think, is encouraging the wrong behaviors.
[3799.00 --> 3800.00]  I'm not anti-modification.
[3800.00 --> 3803.00]  I'm not anti-repair.
[3803.00 --> 3812.00]  What I am is anti-taking something that is explicitly designed to be closed one time and encouraging
[3812.00 --> 3817.00]  people to swap it out as a fashion statement when it wasn't broken.
[3817.00 --> 3820.00]  No, please.
[3820.00 --> 3821.00]  Please, no.
[3821.00 --> 3822.00]  Please, no!
[3822.00 --> 3830.00]  When is Linus going to address the mark on his arm?
[3830.00 --> 3835.00]  It's a faded spray on tattoo that my daughter did for me.
[3835.00 --> 3836.00]  It's nothing.
[3836.00 --> 3837.00]  Yeah.
[3837.00 --> 3838.00]  That's fine.
[3838.00 --> 3842.00]  If someone's a parent and you see a partially washed away tattoo, I guarantee you that's
[3842.00 --> 3843.00]  exactly what it is.
[3843.00 --> 3848.00]  We do have a few other things that we need to kind of talk about here.
[3848.00 --> 3849.00]  Ooh, this is unfortunate.
[3849.00 --> 3858.00]  I see that I've been asked to do a poll for which design you guys are most into from the
[3858.00 --> 3861.00]  LTX exclusive desk pad designs.
[3861.00 --> 3866.00]  But, unfortunately, I don't actually see any links to the pictures.
[3866.00 --> 3870.00]  So, hopefully, someone is watching and can get me links to those.
[3870.00 --> 3873.00]  And we'll get a poll up for you guys because we're trying to figure out what our order split
[3873.00 --> 3874.00]  should be.
[3874.00 --> 3875.00]  Also, we've heard you.
[3875.00 --> 3877.00]  I know this is a really long LTT store update.
[3877.00 --> 3879.00]  Maybe we'll break it up in a little bit here.
[3879.00 --> 3880.00]  But, we have heard you.
[3880.00 --> 3886.00]  You're really upset about the LTX designs being in-person only.
[3886.00 --> 3887.00]  Oh.
[3887.00 --> 3895.00]  We want to create exclusivity for the people who take the time to go to LTX.
[3895.00 --> 3900.00]  But, we also understand that it's not as simple as, well, I just couldn't take the time.
[3900.00 --> 3902.00]  Maybe it just was totally-
[3902.00 --> 3903.00]  Plane tickets are expensive.
[3903.00 --> 3904.00]  Totally unaffordable.
[3904.00 --> 3910.00]  Or, you had some kind of obligation that made it so you absolutely couldn't be there.
[3910.00 --> 3924.00]  So, what I think we're leaning towards right now is having some LTX digital experience available on Floatplane and making LTX exclusive merch available on Floatplane.
[3924.00 --> 3925.00]  That last bit is-
[3925.00 --> 3927.00]  Or two Floatplane subscribers, rather.
[3927.00 --> 3931.00]  More complicated than you might immediately be aware of, but we're looking into it.
[3931.00 --> 3932.00]  Oh.
[3933.00 --> 3935.00]  Have I just committed a thing that is hard?
[3935.00 --> 3936.00]  It's hard.
[3936.00 --> 3937.00]  We can do it.
[3937.00 --> 3940.00]  There's just actually like a lot of steps involved.
[3940.00 --> 3942.00]  Can you do it in two and a half months?
[3942.00 --> 3947.00]  I mean, Conrad just turned something around in like three days that I'm not going to mention.
[3947.00 --> 3950.00]  So, like, probably.
[3950.00 --> 3951.00]  Hey, Conrad.
[3953.00 --> 3954.00]  Yeah.
[3954.00 --> 3955.00]  Guess what?
[3955.00 --> 3956.00]  No, he already knows.
[3956.00 --> 3957.00]  Yeah, okay.
[3957.00 --> 3958.00]  Alright, cool.
[3958.00 --> 3966.00]  So, the Floatplane LTX digital experience or whatever is, I don't know if it's going to be like a one-time charge.
[3966.00 --> 3969.00]  I don't know if it's going to be included in a basic subscription.
[3969.00 --> 3972.00]  I don't know if it's going to be included at a higher tier.
[3972.00 --> 3979.00]  We haven't settled any of that stuff yet because putting on an event like LTX is shockingly expensive.
[3979.00 --> 3984.00]  I got the internet agreement from Jake today.
[3984.00 --> 3985.00]  Oh.
[3985.00 --> 3991.00]  And I'm pretty sure that our contract probably stipulates we can't disclose the numbers.
[3991.00 --> 3998.00]  But what I will tell you is that it is well into five figures for two days of not that fast internet.
[3998.00 --> 4002.00]  Event internet is just a racket.
[4002.00 --> 4004.00]  It's completely corrupt.
[4004.00 --> 4005.00]  Oh, yeah.
[4005.00 --> 4015.00]  It's kind of like that issue you had with that apartment building that you were looking at where Shaw had signed an exclusive agreement with the building so that TELUS could not bring their fiber lines in.
[4015.00 --> 4017.00]  Everyone in the building had to buy through Shaw.
[4017.00 --> 4029.00]  So many event facilities have an exclusive agreement with one internet provider which, as you can imagine, leads that internet provider to give great competitive rates.
[4029.00 --> 4031.00]  It's actually insane.
[4031.00 --> 4032.00]  Like you can...
[4032.00 --> 4036.00]  You can't say the price but you can probably tell me this.
[4036.00 --> 4038.00]  Those two days of internet.
[4038.00 --> 4039.00]  Yeah.
[4039.00 --> 4041.00]  The amount of internet that you're receiving.
[4041.00 --> 4047.00]  I'm sure it would have been cheaper to buy probably multiple years worth if it wasn't at this convention.
[4047.00 --> 4048.00]  Yeah.
[4048.00 --> 4049.00]  Yeah.
[4049.00 --> 4050.00]  Oh, no question.
[4050.00 --> 4052.00]  Like, it's not even sort of close.
[4052.00 --> 4053.00]  No.
[4053.00 --> 4054.00]  No, it makes...
[4054.00 --> 4056.00]  When your scale goes from two days to many years probably, it's like...
[4056.00 --> 4058.00]  It makes no sense.
[4058.00 --> 4063.00]  And you end up in these just ridiculous conversations where, you know, they'll go, oh, well, we kind of...
[4063.00 --> 4064.00]  We kind of...
[4064.00 --> 4068.00]  Because, oh, they build Wi-Fi completely separately from Wired.
[4068.00 --> 4069.00]  Ah, very cool.
[4069.00 --> 4077.00]  And so, you know, as tech savvy people, we kind of went, okay, well, would anything prevent us from plugging an access point into the Wired?
[4077.00 --> 4086.00]  And they're like, well, actually, you might not understand it, but everything's configured on very specific channels and placements.
[4086.00 --> 4089.00]  And I'm kind of sitting here going, we booked the whole building.
[4089.00 --> 4094.00]  Just because you're configured on a channel doesn't mean you're actually broadcast...
[4094.00 --> 4097.00]  Or it doesn't mean you're actually transmitting Jack, right?
[4097.00 --> 4102.00]  So if your access points are sitting there idle on a channel, that's actually not a problem for me.
[4102.00 --> 4107.00]  I can put as many access points as I want on my own channels and I could distribute them however I want.
[4107.00 --> 4110.00]  Now, we're not going to do that because it is against the terms of service.
[4110.00 --> 4111.00]  Ah.
[4111.00 --> 4112.00]  We are good boys.
[4112.00 --> 4120.00]  But they gave us this technical explanation that actually doesn't make any sense because there's plenty of spectrum when it isn't being used.
[4120.00 --> 4124.00]  Because we're the only ones in the building and we didn't book your f***ing Wi-Fi.
[4126.00 --> 4128.00]  By the way, I might have an idea.
[4128.00 --> 4129.00]  Oh?
[4129.00 --> 4132.00]  I'm jumping back to LTT Store just for a second.
[4132.00 --> 4136.00]  Oh, we're going to be back to LTT Store for longer than a second. But yeah, tell me more.
[4136.00 --> 4137.00]  Yeah, tell me more.
[4137.00 --> 4143.00]  This looks like a potentially modifiable, without compromising the integrity of the zipper, zipper.
[4143.00 --> 4146.00]  I believe you could attach cool things to that.
[4147.00 --> 4150.00]  Oh, that's designed for like a little fabric like thing though.
[4150.00 --> 4151.00]  Including literally this carabiner.
[4151.00 --> 4153.00]  Oh, it would be enormous.
[4153.00 --> 4155.00]  It could go right on it.
[4155.00 --> 4156.00]  It'd be like this long.
[4156.00 --> 4157.00]  It could go right on it though.
[4157.00 --> 4158.00]  Yeah.
[4158.00 --> 4160.00]  That's already too long.
[4160.00 --> 4161.00]  Like it's unpleasant.
[4161.00 --> 4162.00]  This one could go on it.
[4162.00 --> 4165.00]  I put that one on my backpack and it sucked.
[4165.00 --> 4166.00]  This...oh wait.
[4166.00 --> 4167.00]  Okay.
[4167.00 --> 4168.00]  That's the biggest one we have.
[4168.00 --> 4169.00]  Yeah.
[4169.00 --> 4170.00]  But the smaller one can go on it too.
[4170.00 --> 4173.00]  Any one that doesn't completely close.
[4173.00 --> 4174.00]  It's the length.
[4174.00 --> 4176.00]  The length is the issue.
[4176.00 --> 4178.00]  This is way too long.
[4178.00 --> 4182.00]  And so when you're adding that thing to it, you're really not giving yourself a lot of options.
[4182.00 --> 4184.00]  Yeah, but you could have smaller versions is what I'm saying.
[4184.00 --> 4186.00]  I'm not talking like this exact thing.
[4186.00 --> 4187.00]  Yeah...
[4187.00 --> 4189.00]  It'd be kind of janky.
[4189.00 --> 4190.00]  I'm just saying.
[4190.00 --> 4191.00]  It'd be janky.
[4191.00 --> 4194.00]  It's not...it's not...it's not like Y...you're sticking to YKK thing.
[4194.00 --> 4197.00]  I'd rather do nothing than do something janky.
[4197.00 --> 4198.00]  Okay.
[4198.00 --> 4199.00]  Um...
[4199.00 --> 4200.00]  That's a very new approach.
[4202.00 --> 4203.00]  On the store.
[4203.00 --> 4204.00]  Okay, okay, okay.
[4204.00 --> 4205.00]  That's fair.
[4205.00 --> 4209.00]  When your minimum order quantity for literally anything is a thousand units.
[4209.00 --> 4211.00]  That does complicate things.
[4211.00 --> 4212.00]  Yeah.
[4212.00 --> 4213.00]  Right?
[4213.00 --> 4215.00]  I can't just be like, oh, you sure?
[4215.00 --> 4218.00]  It doesn't work that way anymore.
[4218.00 --> 4221.00]  Because if I'm stuck with a bunch of crap I can't sell.
[4221.00 --> 4222.00]  Like what?
[4222.00 --> 4224.00]  Well, think about the waste too.
[4224.00 --> 4225.00]  Oh man.
[4225.00 --> 4226.00]  Think about the waste.
[4226.00 --> 4228.00]  We don't want to just generate waste.
[4228.00 --> 4229.00]  That is true.
[4229.00 --> 4230.00]  Yeah.
[4230.00 --> 4231.00]  That I am pretty against.
[4231.00 --> 4232.00]  Not worth it.
[4232.00 --> 4233.00]  It's not worth it.
[4233.00 --> 4234.00]  Okay.
[4234.00 --> 4235.00]  Back to the doc.
[4235.00 --> 4236.00]  Okay.
[4236.00 --> 4237.00]  Right.
[4237.00 --> 4243.00]  If you've seen any other non-LTT designed products you'd like to see us carry.
[4243.00 --> 4244.00]  Let us know.
[4244.00 --> 4246.00]  Maybe just like contact support.
[4246.00 --> 4248.00]  I think they're not completely overwhelmed right now.
[4248.00 --> 4250.00]  So you could contact LTT store support.
[4250.00 --> 4251.00]  I want us to do...
[4251.00 --> 4252.00]  I think I already mentioned this to Nick.
[4252.00 --> 4258.00]  And honestly, he probably told me something smart and informative and my brain just forgot.
[4258.00 --> 4259.00]  But I want us to do...
[4259.00 --> 4271.00]  I want us to take the stainless steel internal design thing of our water bottles and make shakers that don't end up like stinking because of protein.
[4271.00 --> 4272.00]  Oh.
[4272.00 --> 4274.00]  Because the plastics will like absorb.
[4274.00 --> 4275.00]  They all stink.
[4275.00 --> 4276.00]  They all smell really bad.
[4276.00 --> 4278.00]  So like stainless steel shakers are totally a thing.
[4278.00 --> 4279.00]  I think...
[4279.00 --> 4280.00]  I think we had this conversation.
[4280.00 --> 4283.00]  He's probably like, oh, this dummy.
[4283.00 --> 4286.00]  But I don't fully remember because my brain is fried.
[4286.00 --> 4287.00]  Yeah.
[4287.00 --> 4288.00]  We could try and figure out something like that.
[4288.00 --> 4290.00]  Also, I have an update for you guys.
[4290.00 --> 4294.00]  That Steam Deck carry bag thing that we showed off last week.
[4294.00 --> 4298.00]  There's now an official LTT forum post for it.
[4298.00 --> 4301.00]  So you guys can go ahead and give us any feedback that you have on that.
[4301.00 --> 4304.00]  Riley posted it in Comic Sans.
[4304.00 --> 4305.00]  Okay.
[4305.00 --> 4306.00]  Thanks, Riley.
[4306.00 --> 4307.00]  That's really helpful.
[4307.00 --> 4311.00]  Anyway, it's this thing.
[4311.00 --> 4312.00]  Okay.
[4312.00 --> 4315.00]  So it's from last week's show.
[4315.00 --> 4318.00]  But if you guys can give us any feedback, that would be great.
[4318.00 --> 4323.00]  And then the last thing is actually not something on the show.
[4323.00 --> 4324.00]  You know what?
[4324.00 --> 4325.00]  Let's do a couple merch messages.
[4325.00 --> 4328.00]  And then I want to talk about paid reviews.
[4328.00 --> 4329.00]  Oh.
[4329.00 --> 4330.00]  Okay.
[4330.00 --> 4331.00]  Yeah.
[4331.00 --> 4332.00]  Okay.
[4332.00 --> 4336.00]  We're navigating a moral quandary here.
[4336.00 --> 4337.00]  Oh.
[4337.00 --> 4338.00]  Around paid reviews.
[4338.00 --> 4339.00]  Okay.
[4339.00 --> 4340.00]  But first.
[4340.00 --> 4342.00]  First, Dan, do you want to hit us with a couple merch messages?
[4342.00 --> 4343.00]  Three merch messages.
[4343.00 --> 4345.00]  Three merch messages specifically.
[4345.00 --> 4346.00]  That I can do.
[4346.00 --> 4348.00]  First one up is from Jack.
[4348.00 --> 4353.00]  Suppose an employee has an idea for a product that they believe LTT Labs or Creator Warehouse could improve upon.
[4353.00 --> 4358.00]  Is there an official way to submit their idea to be considered for future attention?
[4359.00 --> 4360.00]  Um.
[4360.00 --> 4361.00]  Official way?
[4361.00 --> 4362.00]  I don't technically think so.
[4362.00 --> 4365.00]  But internally, we've always been open to those types of conversations.
[4365.00 --> 4368.00]  I assume they mean officially, internally.
[4368.00 --> 4370.00]  I mean, email?
[4370.00 --> 4371.00]  Yeah.
[4371.00 --> 4372.00]  Teams message?
[4372.00 --> 4373.00]  Yeah.
[4373.00 --> 4375.00]  We've been open to those conversations.
[4375.00 --> 4379.00]  I don't think there is like a documented this is what you do procedure for doing that.
[4379.00 --> 4380.00]  I mean, maybe there should be.
[4380.00 --> 4381.00]  I don't know.
[4381.00 --> 4382.00]  Maybe there should.
[4382.00 --> 4383.00]  But like.
[4383.00 --> 4384.00]  Yeah.
[4384.00 --> 4385.00]  Email me random stuff all the time.
[4385.00 --> 4386.00]  Yeah.
[4386.00 --> 4387.00]  Yeah.
[4387.00 --> 4388.00]  That's kind of what I'm trying to get.
[4388.00 --> 4390.00]  It's not like those conversations don't happen.
[4390.00 --> 4391.00]  Yeah.
[4391.00 --> 4395.00]  But like we don't have like an internal form to fill out or anything like that.
[4395.00 --> 4396.00]  No.
[4396.00 --> 4397.00]  Yeah.
[4397.00 --> 4398.00]  I don't think so.
[4398.00 --> 4399.00]  Yeah.
[4399.00 --> 4400.00]  Okay.
[4400.00 --> 4401.00]  Next up is from Ryan.
[4401.00 --> 4402.00]  Hey LLD.
[4402.00 --> 4404.00]  I'm a trucker that listens to WAN show on Mondays.
[4404.00 --> 4405.00]  I prefer DLL personally, but yeah.
[4405.00 --> 4406.00]  Yeah.
[4406.00 --> 4407.00]  It's a computer thing.
[4407.00 --> 4410.00]  I'm a trucker that listens to WAN show on Mondays.
[4410.00 --> 4414.00]  So hopefully I'll get to hear you talk about me in the future.
[4414.00 --> 4418.00]  What tech item would you like to disassemble if you had no restrictions at all?
[4418.00 --> 4419.00]  Oh.
[4419.00 --> 4421.00]  What do you want to take apart?
[4421.00 --> 4422.00]  Okay.
[4422.00 --> 4429.00]  The first thing that popped into my mind is our metal 3D printer that we had to sign an
[4429.00 --> 4432.00]  agreement that we wouldn't take it apart in order to get it.
[4432.00 --> 4435.00]  Oh, that makes you want to do it so bad.
[4435.00 --> 4436.00]  Yeah.
[4436.00 --> 4438.00]  That's why I want to do it so bad.
[4438.00 --> 4439.00]  Yeah.
[4439.00 --> 4440.00]  Yeah.
[4440.00 --> 4441.00]  That's pretty good.
[4441.00 --> 4443.00]  I take a lot of things apart.
[4443.00 --> 4445.00]  So I don't know.
[4445.00 --> 4448.00]  I recently had to take apart.
[4448.00 --> 4451.00]  So someone in my household.
[4451.00 --> 4452.00]  Okay.
[4452.00 --> 4454.00]  That narrows it down a fair bit.
[4454.00 --> 4457.00]  There's still two, but yeah.
[4457.00 --> 4461.00]  Not naming any names, but there's a 50% chance I'll get it right if I guess.
[4461.00 --> 4462.00]  Go ahead.
[4462.00 --> 4463.00]  Yeah.
[4463.00 --> 4465.00]  And I'll be able to tell from his reaction if I've got it anyway.
[4465.00 --> 4472.00]  They cooked the power cable to the Vitamix.
[4472.00 --> 4473.00]  Oh.
[4473.00 --> 4474.00]  That's a shame.
[4474.00 --> 4475.00]  On the stovetop.
[4475.00 --> 4477.00]  Was able to get it off the stovetop, whatever.
[4477.00 --> 4482.00]  But it cooked into the cable enough that it was like, I probably shouldn't use this anymore.
[4482.00 --> 4483.00]  Yeah.
[4483.00 --> 4485.00]  I think I know who that was.
[4485.00 --> 4486.00]  Cool.
[4486.00 --> 4487.00]  Carry on.
[4487.00 --> 4488.00]  I don't know.
[4488.00 --> 4489.00]  Maybe.
[4489.00 --> 4490.00]  I don't know.
[4490.00 --> 4493.00]  Um, and I fixed it recently.
[4493.00 --> 4494.00]  Yeah.
[4494.00 --> 4495.00]  I didn't do it for like a long time.
[4495.00 --> 4501.00]  Cause like whatever, but I did fix it recently and I took it apart and man, that thing is annoying to take apart.
[4501.00 --> 4504.00]  And there's no, they sell like the replacement.
[4504.00 --> 4505.00]  Hmm.
[4505.00 --> 4506.00]  Maybe it's not them.
[4506.00 --> 4507.00]  Maybe I bought it from someone else.
[4507.00 --> 4508.00]  I don't know.
[4508.00 --> 4509.00]  It's like a replacement cord, which worked great.
[4509.00 --> 4510.00]  Sure.
[4510.00 --> 4511.00]  Um, and it's like good quality, all that kind of stuff.
[4511.00 --> 4516.00]  I liked it, but, oh geez, that was, that was quite an annoying procedure, but it was kind
[4516.00 --> 4518.00]  of interesting to see how they get it done.
[4518.00 --> 4519.00]  I don't know.
[4519.00 --> 4521.00]  Um, but yeah, I just disassemble things.
[4521.00 --> 4523.00]  I don't really, they're like no restrictions thing.
[4523.00 --> 4525.00]  I didn't know about the restriction on that.
[4525.00 --> 4527.00]  Everything else, as far as I'm concerned, like.
[4527.00 --> 4532.00]  Well, like the cost, knowing that you would have to destructively disassemble something,
[4532.00 --> 4534.00]  maybe there's something you wouldn't disassemble.
[4534.00 --> 4541.00]  I think that's a realm that I have not been cheap in.
[4541.00 --> 4543.00]  I think we finally found one.
[4543.00 --> 4544.00]  Wow.
[4544.00 --> 4548.00]  If I, if I feel like I need to disassemble something, I just do it.
[4548.00 --> 4549.00]  Yeah.
[4549.00 --> 4551.00]  MRI machine.
[4551.00 --> 4555.00]  I feel like there wouldn't even be that much.
[4555.00 --> 4558.00]  You'd be able to see with the naked eye.
[4558.00 --> 4559.00]  Yeah, but just the fun of it.
[4559.00 --> 4560.00]  Yeah, I guess.
[4560.00 --> 4561.00]  Sure.
[4561.00 --> 4563.00]  I don't know anything about it.
[4563.00 --> 4565.00]  Isn't it just a giant magnet?
[4565.00 --> 4566.00]  Hit me, Dan.
[4566.00 --> 4567.00]  I don't know anything about it.
[4567.00 --> 4568.00]  All right.
[4568.00 --> 4569.00]  Up next is from Marshall.
[4569.00 --> 4571.00]  Linus, what gym bag do you currently use?
[4571.00 --> 4575.00]  I need something to hold me over until you bring yours to market, and I know you will
[4575.00 --> 4578.00]  be doing a long time off.
[4578.00 --> 4581.00]  Dan, you really do have a creative way of reading these.
[4581.00 --> 4582.00]  Uh, they're hard.
[4582.00 --> 4583.00]  They're hard.
[4583.00 --> 4591.00]  Uh, I use an ancient Yonix badminton bag from like 1989 or something like that, that I inherited
[4591.00 --> 4592.00]  from my in-laws.
[4592.00 --> 4594.00]  I thought it was cool.
[4594.00 --> 4596.00]  They weren't playing and I was like, can I use this?
[4596.00 --> 4598.00]  And then I literally never gave it back.
[4598.00 --> 4600.00]  I can confirm it's the same one.
[4600.00 --> 4601.00]  Yep.
[4601.00 --> 4602.00]  That it has always been.
[4602.00 --> 4603.00]  Yep.
[4603.00 --> 4604.00]  It's fine.
[4604.00 --> 4608.00]  I have sewn it back together twice.
[4608.00 --> 4610.00]  But I, I love it.
[4610.00 --> 4614.00]  It's like, uh, it's so, it's so old and crappy that it's not crappy anymore.
[4614.00 --> 4616.00]  Now it's like vintage.
[4616.00 --> 4621.00]  Um, and I, I get comments on it because even the Yonix logo is, it's not the same as their
[4621.00 --> 4622.00]  current logo.
[4622.00 --> 4623.00]  That's cool.
[4623.00 --> 4626.00]  It's like some ancient logo that they haven't used in a fit in like probably the lifetime
[4626.00 --> 4628.00]  of some people who work here.
[4628.00 --> 4630.00]  So it's, yeah, I, I don't know.
[4630.00 --> 4631.00]  I like it.
[4631.00 --> 4632.00]  I think it's cool.
[4632.00 --> 4634.00]  I, I think we should do a gym bag at some point.
[4634.00 --> 4636.00]  I have a Hayabusa gym bag.
[4636.00 --> 4640.00]  However, I don't have a lot of feedback to give on what makes a great gym bag other
[4640.00 --> 4645.00]  than, you know, probably some mesh, uh, probably a spot for us to put our little air circulation
[4645.00 --> 4646.00]  device.
[4646.00 --> 4647.00]  If we ever actually release it.
[4647.00 --> 4650.00]  I would want, uh, I haven't seen this in, in gym bags personally.
[4650.00 --> 4652.00]  I'm sure someone's be like, this one has it.
[4652.00 --> 4653.00]  How didn't you know?
[4653.00 --> 4655.00]  I have not shopped around for gym bags.
[4655.00 --> 4657.00]  Uh, I would want a divider because of like a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
[4657.00 --> 4659.00]  a, a, a dirty clothes barrier.
[4659.00 --> 4662.00]  Cause there's a decent amount, about a time where there's like a change room.
[4662.00 --> 4667.00]  And if you're a sweaty boy or girl or whatever else, you might want to change after you do
[4667.00 --> 4668.00]  your physical activity.
[4668.00 --> 4674.00]  And that means you have like sweaty, gross clothes and being able to put that in, be
[4674.00 --> 4679.00]  able to put that in a divided area that has a vent that has a zipper panel over it.
[4679.00 --> 4682.00]  So you could decide for it to not be vented.
[4682.00 --> 4686.00]  And more of like a waterproof lining instead of like a, like a fabric lining.
[4686.00 --> 4687.00]  So it won't absorb anything.
[4687.00 --> 4688.00]  Yeah.
[4688.00 --> 4691.00]  Um, but then, yeah, you could decide if you want it to vent it.
[4691.00 --> 4696.00]  So like if you're outside, you can have it vented, but if you have to like drive home for half an hour
[4696.00 --> 4700.00]  and you don't want it to like reek in your car, you can just close the panel.
[4700.00 --> 4701.00]  Okay. That'd be kind of cool.
[4701.00 --> 4702.00]  That would be sweet.
[4702.00 --> 4704.00]  That seems like the kind of thing that has to exist.
[4704.00 --> 4710.00]  I feel like it probably does. I haven't seen it. Um, and my bag doesn't have it, but like, I don't know.
[4710.00 --> 4714.00]  Someone says Under Armour bags have it. Um, so yeah, it's the kind of thing where we'd probably have to go
[4714.00 --> 4720.00]  buy some, buy some competing bags and kind of see how everyone does their thing and see if there's anything that we
[4720.00 --> 4721.00]  think we could do better.
[4723.00 --> 4727.00]  All right. Let's talk about paid reviews.
[4727.00 --> 4735.00]  We have a very clear stance on our channels that you cannot pay for, uh, an opinion.
[4735.00 --> 4741.00]  That's sort of, that's, that's, I think the most succinct way that I could draw a line in the sand.
[4741.00 --> 4745.00]  Um, you can pay for airtime.
[4745.00 --> 4746.00]  Sure.
[4746.00 --> 4747.00]  For your talking points.
[4747.00 --> 4748.00]  We'll showcase your thing.
[4748.00 --> 4751.00]  But we will make it very clear that those are your talking points.
[4751.00 --> 4753.00]  Yeah. And there's some we won't say.
[4753.00 --> 4761.00]  Of course. Yeah. We won't say anything that we don't in good faith and to our, to the best of our ability, believe to be true.
[4761.00 --> 4762.00]  Yeah.
[4762.00 --> 4768.00]  Um, and we will make it clear when there is your talking points versus our opinion.
[4768.00 --> 4770.00]  You can never buy an opinion.
[4770.00 --> 4778.00]  Um, now, obviously, you know, I think you guys have probably seen many creators talk about this in the past.
[4778.00 --> 4795.00]  Uh, I don't think I've talked about it in quite a long time, but there's, there's many brands and many creators who treat the line between paid content and editorial content, um, as either blurry or non-existent.
[4795.00 --> 4799.00]  Um, that'll, that'll never happen here.
[4799.00 --> 4814.00]  However, the reason that I'm in a bit of a moral dilemma is that we've been learning a lot more about marketing because while it's great that we can, you know, create cool products like that desk pad, enjoy it, James K.
[4814.00 --> 4819.00]  Um, or the backpack or that great underwear Jason W is about to, about to be wearing.
[4819.00 --> 4822.00]  Um, Ooh, now I'm picturing Jason W in that underwear.
[4822.00 --> 4825.00]  Anyway, the point is we can create these great products.
[4825.00 --> 4842.00]  We can tell you guys about them, but if we wanted to take creator warehouse from, you know, a brand that makes merch to a brand that creates products for sale to the, the general public, we need to figure out marketing.
[4842.00 --> 4847.00]  Right. Other than just using our own channels to communicate about our products.
[4847.00 --> 4856.00]  And as we're learning more about it, we are learning just how things appear to work.
[4856.00 --> 4857.00]  Okay.
[4857.00 --> 4860.00]  So let me ask you this.
[4860.00 --> 4861.00]  Okay.
[4861.00 --> 4866.00]  We have, uh, this was actually, this was prompted by something really cool.
[4866.00 --> 4871.00]  Uh, in Frameworks promotional video announcing the Frameworks 16,
[4871.00 --> 4872.00]  their upcoming gaming laptop.
[4872.00 --> 4873.00]  Hey!
[4873.00 --> 4874.00]  There's something there.
[4874.00 --> 4875.00]  Yeah.
[4875.00 --> 4877.00]  The LTT backpack made a, made a casual appearance.
[4877.00 --> 4878.00]  Yeah.
[4878.00 --> 4882.00]  Which got a couple thousand up votes on our slash line is tech tips.
[4882.00 --> 4883.00]  Pretty cool.
[4883.00 --> 4884.00]  Sweet.
[4884.00 --> 4886.00]  Um, that all, that all happened organically.
[4886.00 --> 4888.00]  No money changed place, changed hands.
[4888.00 --> 4891.00]  We just, they asked for a backpack and we were like, okay.
[4891.00 --> 4894.00]  And then they, they used it for that, which is, which is super cool.
[4894.00 --> 4898.00]  But what we're discovering is that that doesn't really happen that much.
[4898.00 --> 4899.00]  Um,
[4899.00 --> 4900.00]  Organics stuff.
[4900.00 --> 4903.00]  I mean, I I've called us out for doing it on the show, right?
[4903.00 --> 4905.00]  Like it happens.
[4905.00 --> 4906.00]  Oh no, I just mean, okay.
[4906.00 --> 4910.00]  So I'm talking about, um, in marketing the backpack.
[4910.00 --> 4911.00]  Uh,
[4911.00 --> 4915.00]  So what we're learning is that there's a lot of pay to play.
[4915.00 --> 4917.00]  Affiliate revenue is huge.
[4917.00 --> 4918.00]  So, so great.
[4918.00 --> 4922.00]  This was what sparked the discussion though, was we were looking at, um, the inclusion in
[4922.00 --> 4925.00]  Frameworks promotional video and just sort of talking about, okay, you know, what have
[4925.00 --> 4927.00]  we seen marketing wise?
[4927.00 --> 4928.00]  What are some of the strategies?
[4928.00 --> 4933.00]  Um, and then one of the other things that prompted it was, uh, Yvonne was looking into,
[4933.00 --> 4938.00]  uh, pool cleaning robots and we've all seen these articles, right?
[4938.00 --> 4939.00]  Uh,
[4939.00 --> 4940.00]  Um,
[4940.00 --> 4941.00]  Just gonna say,
[4941.00 --> 4942.00]  I don't want to talk about it.
[4942.00 --> 4943.00]  I don't want to talk about it.
[4943.00 --> 4944.00]  Okay.
[4944.00 --> 4946.00]  So, so we've all seen these articles.
[4946.00 --> 4951.00]  I'm going to go past the sponsored ones and I'm not singling out the spruce, but you
[4951.00 --> 4959.00]  know, this article where there's a bunch of, no, it's not me.
[4959.00 --> 4962.00]  Mine's like, sorry about that phone interference.
[4962.00 --> 4967.00]  Guys, where there's, there's a bunch of stuff, right?
[4967.00 --> 4971.00]  Uh, there's a bunch of stock imagery or product page imagery.
[4971.00 --> 4975.00]  They clearly didn't, um, actually test every single one of these.
[4975.00 --> 4980.00]  Um, actually this one looks like they actually have their own pictures.
[4980.00 --> 4981.00]  Okay, cool.
[4981.00 --> 4985.00]  So shout out the spruce maybe for actually reviewing these things.
[4985.00 --> 4989.00]  But the one that Yvonne came across was using all imagery from like Getty images.
[4989.00 --> 4990.00]  Oh, these are super common.
[4990.00 --> 4991.00]  Yeah.
[4991.00 --> 4992.00]  Just like stock images of pools.
[4992.00 --> 4997.00]  And I know I'm, I'm this guy, but a bunch of them these days are AI generated.
[4997.00 --> 4998.00]  Yes.
[4998.00 --> 5004.00]  And so what we're, what we're learning is that basically the only way to end up on one of
[5004.00 --> 5013.00]  these lists is to offer, okay, is to offer some kind of affiliate revenue, which to be clear,
[5013.00 --> 5015.00]  affiliate revenue is not a bad thing.
[5015.00 --> 5021.00]  What's bad is the completely pay to play nature of a lot of what we're seeing.
[5021.00 --> 5022.00]  Yeah.
[5022.00 --> 5025.00]  Now, this is where things get even more complicated.
[5025.00 --> 5030.00]  In exploring ways to promote the backpack outside of the traditional LTT audience, we've
[5030.00 --> 5038.00]  come across creators, individual creators who will kind of say, okay, yeah, I, I need, basically,
[5038.00 --> 5043.00]  I'm not going to touch anything that doesn't have an affiliate program associated with it.
[5043.00 --> 5050.00]  And I expect a flat fee for inclusion in the first place.
[5050.00 --> 5056.00]  Now, some of the creators that we've encountered, I mean, we have no way of knowing.
[5056.00 --> 5057.00]  Don't disclose.
[5057.00 --> 5062.00]  But from what we can tell, don't appear to disclose these payments.
[5062.00 --> 5067.00]  So tell me this, this is the moral quandary.
[5067.00 --> 5073.00]  Are you okay with us engaging the services of such a person?
[5073.00 --> 5074.00]  No.
[5074.00 --> 5075.00]  I'm not done yet.
[5075.00 --> 5076.00]  Okay.
[5076.00 --> 5080.00]  If our contract stipulates that everything needs to be disclosed.
[5080.00 --> 5081.00]  They have to disclose.
[5081.00 --> 5083.00]  So you gotta let me finish.
[5083.00 --> 5084.00]  No.
[5084.00 --> 5085.00]  Really.
[5085.00 --> 5090.00]  The problem is because you almost add more credibility to that person.
[5090.00 --> 5094.00]  And you add more credibility to the videos where they don't disclose.
[5094.00 --> 5096.00]  Because now it looks like they would.
[5098.00 --> 5099.00]  Alright.
[5099.00 --> 5100.00]  So then.
[5101.00 --> 5103.00]  Yeah, I don't, I don't like it.
[5103.00 --> 5104.00]  I wouldn't touch that.
[5104.00 --> 5105.00]  Okay.
[5105.00 --> 5106.00]  So what about the listicles?
[5106.00 --> 5108.00]  So let's forget the pay to play.
[5108.00 --> 5111.00]  What about the ones that are basically just like, yeah, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna touch
[5111.00 --> 5112.00]  it if there's no affiliate program.
[5112.00 --> 5113.00]  The listicles.
[5113.00 --> 5114.00]  Yep.
[5114.00 --> 5117.00]  Are a little bit more kind of open about that.
[5117.00 --> 5119.00]  It's, it seems pretty obvious to me.
[5119.00 --> 5120.00]  Not all of them.
[5120.00 --> 5121.00]  Okay.
[5121.00 --> 5122.00]  Then I wouldn't work with those.
[5122.00 --> 5123.00]  Okay.
[5123.00 --> 5125.00]  A lot of the time it's not that simple.
[5125.00 --> 5131.00]  A lot of the time it's more like you submit your affiliate program to an affiliate program.
[5131.00 --> 5134.00]  Um, what would I call this?
[5134.00 --> 5136.00]  Like, uh, I don't know.
[5136.00 --> 5139.00]  Commission Junction is one of them, but it's like an official affiliate program.
[5139.00 --> 5140.00]  It's a grouping of websites.
[5140.00 --> 5141.00]  Yeah.
[5141.00 --> 5142.00]  Yeah.
[5142.00 --> 5146.00]  Not, not a grouping of websites necessarily, but, uh, um, no, amalgamator, not a something,
[5146.00 --> 5150.00]  something aider congregator, something, uh, whatever.
[5150.00 --> 5151.00]  I'm missing.
[5151.00 --> 5152.00]  Aggregator.
[5152.00 --> 5153.00]  Aggregator.
[5153.00 --> 5154.00]  Thank you.
[5154.00 --> 5155.00]  Why couldn't I find that word?
[5155.00 --> 5159.00]  Um, so it would be like an affiliate program aggregator or like marketplace.
[5159.00 --> 5160.00]  Sure.
[5160.00 --> 5163.00]  You can't control who is going to use your affiliate program.
[5163.00 --> 5166.00]  So like the bounty program through Twitch, that type of thing.
[5166.00 --> 5167.00]  Exactly.
[5167.00 --> 5168.00]  Okay.
[5168.00 --> 5173.00]  So I'm not necessarily in control of what sites or like, I don't even know, right?
[5173.00 --> 5181.00]  Because you've got individuals that might run 40 websites, bagcomparison.com, bagcomparisoncheck.com.
[5181.00 --> 5184.00]  That, and bags for flights.com.
[5184.00 --> 5185.00]  Exactly.
[5185.00 --> 5186.00]  Yeah.
[5186.00 --> 5187.00]  Yeah.
[5187.00 --> 5192.00]  Um, how well do you think those websites work?
[5192.00 --> 5194.00]  Have you guys looked into that?
[5194.00 --> 5195.00]  Incredibly well.
[5195.00 --> 5196.00]  Yeah.
[5196.00 --> 5199.00]  If we don't, basically that's how it works.
[5199.00 --> 5200.00]  That's how it works these days.
[5200.00 --> 5208.00]  If we do not participate in affiliate programs, we can, we will pretty much expect everyone
[5208.00 --> 5211.00]  other than our friends like snazzy labs.
[5211.00 --> 5212.00]  Hmm.
[5212.00 --> 5215.00]  Well, no, we won't get only audience sales cause we'll get word of mouth, which we do.
[5215.00 --> 5217.00]  The backpack is still moving very well.
[5217.00 --> 5224.00]  Um, but if we want to break into the mainstream, the people who type, what's the best bag for
[5224.00 --> 5229.00]  day trips on Google, that's where they end up period.
[5229.00 --> 5237.00]  And if we want to have any kind of foothold in that space, that's how it works period.
[5237.00 --> 5238.00]  So what is that?
[5238.00 --> 5239.00]  So what does that?
[5239.00 --> 5242.00]  There's someone in Flowplane chat that says, I have some of those websites.
[5242.00 --> 5243.00]  They work really well.
[5243.00 --> 5253.00]  Um, see, this is, this is, it's like, this, this is, can you ask one of those aggregates
[5253.00 --> 5257.00]  for a like integrity report almost?
[5257.00 --> 5258.00]  No.
[5258.00 --> 5264.00]  I mean, I look, I'm assuming, but no, I don't actually know that for sure.
[5264.00 --> 5266.00]  How on earth would they manage that?
[5266.00 --> 5268.00]  And here's the other followup question.
[5268.00 --> 5269.00]  Why would they do that?
[5269.00 --> 5270.00]  Why would they care?
[5270.00 --> 5271.00]  They don't.
[5272.00 --> 5273.00]  Hmm.
[5273.00 --> 5278.00]  I don't think you can necessarily say that because if you look at, if you look at like manufacturing
[5278.00 --> 5282.00]  around the world for almost anything, there's a range, right?
[5282.00 --> 5289.00]  There's the, there's one end of the range where it like just straight up uses slave labor
[5289.00 --> 5295.00]  or child labor or, or materials or whatever in, in super, super negative, super bad ways.
[5295.00 --> 5300.00]  And then there's the other end of the spectrum where it's like all super above board.
[5302.00 --> 5304.00]  And you can ask like, why would they care?
[5304.00 --> 5309.00]  And it's like, yeah, some companies don't, and they will 100% go full pin as far as they
[5309.00 --> 5311.00]  can ensure evil practices.
[5311.00 --> 5312.00]  But they're not an aggregator.
[5312.00 --> 5313.00]  And some companies do.
[5313.00 --> 5314.00]  Right.
[5314.00 --> 5317.00]  But like that, there might be an aggregator that does care about those things.
[5317.00 --> 5321.00]  Um, Luke, you're being super naive right now.
[5321.00 --> 5322.00]  I doubt it.
[5322.00 --> 5323.00]  I don't think I am.
[5323.00 --> 5326.00]  Uh, you can say I am.
[5326.00 --> 5329.00]  I don't, I don't necessarily think I'm not surprised that.
[5329.00 --> 5330.00]  Yeah.
[5330.00 --> 5331.00]  Sure.
[5331.00 --> 5332.00]  The majority of them don't.
[5332.00 --> 5333.00]  I don't know everything about the space.
[5333.00 --> 5336.00]  I don't think the only way to interface with this is through aggregators.
[5336.00 --> 5339.00]  Uh, I'm sure it's not.
[5339.00 --> 5340.00]  It might be the easiest way.
[5340.00 --> 5341.00]  Yeah.
[5341.00 --> 5343.00]  It might be the most normal way, but you don't have to take that path.
[5343.00 --> 5347.00]  And I don't think that accepting that is, is required or fair.
[5347.00 --> 5348.00]  Here's the thing though.
[5348.00 --> 5352.00]  Why do you think we're talking to individual creators and finding out how they work?
[5352.00 --> 5353.00]  Exactly.
[5353.00 --> 5355.00]  Because we're trying to go around it.
[5355.00 --> 5356.00]  Yeah.
[5356.00 --> 5357.00]  So what I'm telling you is the end result.
[5357.00 --> 5358.00]  Okay.
[5358.00 --> 5359.00]  So then don't do it.
[5359.00 --> 5361.00]  So then don't do an affiliate program.
[5361.00 --> 5366.00]  If there isn't an option to do things above board, don't do things below board.
[5366.00 --> 5367.00]  Well, hold on a second.
[5367.00 --> 5369.00]  Why am I not above board?
[5369.00 --> 5370.00]  Because you're working.
[5370.00 --> 5371.00]  Sure.
[5371.00 --> 5374.00]  This is, this is the same, the same thing that I just described.
[5374.00 --> 5375.00]  Sure.
[5375.00 --> 5377.00]  Working with people on that end is using that end.
[5377.00 --> 5378.00]  Sure.
[5378.00 --> 5381.00]  But so then we shouldn't offer an affiliate program.
[5381.00 --> 5383.00]  If you're like, Hey, I need protection for my building.
[5383.00 --> 5384.00]  Yeah.
[5384.00 --> 5388.00]  There's this company who tries their best to like, you know, have some people out watching
[5388.00 --> 5391.00]  around, taking care of things, putting alarms on stuff.
[5391.00 --> 5392.00]  Right.
[5392.00 --> 5393.00]  But hold on.
[5393.00 --> 5395.00]  That's the other company that just kills everyone that's around the building.
[5395.00 --> 5396.00]  Hold on a second.
[5396.00 --> 5397.00]  You shouldn't work with the other.
[5397.00 --> 5398.00]  Hold on.
[5398.00 --> 5399.00]  That's still a hypothetical company though.
[5399.00 --> 5400.00]  Okay.
[5400.00 --> 5405.00]  So if that company does sort of, there's working with the mob to gain security for your building.
[5405.00 --> 5406.00]  Right.
[5406.00 --> 5407.00]  But hold on a second.
[5407.00 --> 5408.00]  Can we back up?
[5408.00 --> 5411.00]  So you've still got this hypothetical aggregator that does what, what did you call it?
[5411.00 --> 5412.00]  Like an integrity report?
[5412.00 --> 5415.00]  What I'm saying is if that doesn't exist.
[5415.00 --> 5416.00]  Sure.
[5416.00 --> 5417.00]  Don't work with them.
[5417.00 --> 5418.00]  Okay.
[5418.00 --> 5423.00]  So then we should go find individual sort of outlets.
[5423.00 --> 5424.00]  If possible.
[5424.00 --> 5425.00]  And we should engage with them directly.
[5425.00 --> 5426.00]  If possible.
[5426.00 --> 5428.00]  Are you trying to kill our accounting department?
[5428.00 --> 5429.00]  Then don't do it.
[5429.00 --> 5431.00]  So don't do any affiliate program.
[5431.00 --> 5435.00]  I don't think you should work with people who lie and cheat.
[5435.00 --> 5438.00]  But the aggregator doesn't lie or cheat.
[5438.00 --> 5440.00]  But they work with people that do.
[5440.00 --> 5441.00]  Mm-hmm.
[5441.00 --> 5443.00]  So then they might as well.
[5443.00 --> 5444.00]  I see.
[5444.00 --> 5447.00]  I don't think, in my opinion, there is not a difference in that at all.
[5447.00 --> 5451.00]  So I should, I should just.
[5451.00 --> 5454.00]  Because they're like, if you're a clothing company and you put logos on shirts.
[5454.00 --> 5455.00]  Uh-huh.
[5455.00 --> 5457.00]  You don't make the shirts.
[5457.00 --> 5459.00]  But the shirts are made in sweatshops.
[5459.00 --> 5461.00]  You're selling shirts that are made in sweatshops.
[5461.00 --> 5462.00]  I see.
[5462.00 --> 5463.00]  I see.
[5463.00 --> 5464.00]  But I am.
[5464.00 --> 5468.00]  But you've got my position in this transaction reversed.
[5468.00 --> 5470.00]  So I'm the fact.
[5470.00 --> 5471.00]  I don't think it makes a difference.
[5471.00 --> 5473.00]  I'm the manufacturer with the integrity.
[5473.00 --> 5474.00]  Sure.
[5474.00 --> 5476.00]  Ultimately, it's a good product.
[5476.00 --> 5478.00]  Why should I care how people end up with it?
[5478.00 --> 5483.00]  That doesn't work, in my opinion.
[5483.00 --> 5484.00]  That doesn't work at all.
[5484.00 --> 5485.00]  Why not?
[5485.00 --> 5489.00]  Because you're still working with people that are lying and cheating.
[5489.00 --> 5491.00]  It doesn't matter what part of the chain they exist in.
[5491.00 --> 5493.00]  That's completely irrelevant.
[5493.00 --> 5495.00]  So then, so I should just.
[5495.00 --> 5497.00]  You can move yourself in the chain if you want.
[5497.00 --> 5499.00]  So you make things well.
[5499.00 --> 5500.00]  Yeah.
[5500.00 --> 5503.00]  You make things with good labor, with good materials, all that type of stuff.
[5503.00 --> 5504.00]  Sure.
[5504.00 --> 5505.00]  Disclosures.
[5505.00 --> 5509.50]  Because the aggregator are trying to get people into the store, the people that you use to
[5509.50 --> 5511.50]  get people into your store are evil.
[5511.50 --> 5512.50]  And you're like, that's fine.
[5512.50 --> 5513.50]  That's not fine.
[5513.50 --> 5514.50]  But are they?
[5514.50 --> 5515.50]  If you don't know.
[5515.50 --> 5517.50]  So you say the aggregator is evil.
[5517.50 --> 5521.50]  You're saying that you are finding a lot of these sites that don't have disclosure.
[5521.50 --> 5522.50]  Yeah.
[5522.50 --> 5523.50]  You're saying that none of them will do integrity reports.
[5523.50 --> 5527.50]  So you're saying there's probably a pretty much guarantee that they're working with sites
[5527.50 --> 5528.50]  that are not good.
[5528.50 --> 5529.50]  Well, I'm not saying that.
[5529.50 --> 5530.50]  I'm not saying that they don't do integrity reports.
[5530.50 --> 5531.50]  I'm saying probably not.
[5531.50 --> 5532.50]  Okay.
[5532.50 --> 5533.50]  So let's assume that they don't.
[5533.50 --> 5534.50]  Why would they care?
[5534.50 --> 5536.00]  How is it not their problem?
[5536.00 --> 5538.00]  Well, how is it their problem?
[5538.00 --> 5539.00]  What do you mean?
[5539.00 --> 5541.70]  I mean, like, so is it the bank's problem?
[5541.70 --> 5545.00]  If someone withdraws money and then uses it for criminal activity?
[5545.00 --> 5546.00]  Like what?
[5546.00 --> 5547.00]  How?
[5547.00 --> 5548.50]  All they are is an intermediary.
[5548.50 --> 5551.00]  That, I don't think that comparison lines up at all.
[5551.00 --> 5554.00]  Is it the Bitcoin protocol's problem that people use it for piracy?
[5554.00 --> 5556.00]  I mean...
[5556.00 --> 5557.00]  No.
[5557.00 --> 5560.00]  So I actually don't follow you.
[5560.00 --> 5561.00]  That doesn't make any sense.
[5561.00 --> 5563.00]  That argument doesn't hold water at all.
[5563.00 --> 5564.00]  This is not what's happening.
[5564.00 --> 5566.00]  You just tried to say this is the wrong part of the chain.
[5566.00 --> 5567.50]  That's also the wrong part of the chain.
[5567.50 --> 5568.50]  What?
[5568.50 --> 5572.20]  What you're trying to say is like if someone uses our bag and puts bricks in it and beat
[5572.20 --> 5573.50]  someone with it, is it our fault?
[5573.50 --> 5574.50]  Yeah.
[5574.50 --> 5575.50]  Yeah, absolutely not.
[5575.50 --> 5576.50]  That's not what we're talking about in the slightest.
[5576.50 --> 5596.00]  What we're talking about is that if we create an affiliate program which will enable legitimate full disclosure publications to benefit from an affiliate program for our bag which allows us to market it, then because someone will be crappy and not disclose it, we should not do that?
[5596.00 --> 5597.00]  Yes.
[5597.00 --> 5598.00]  Why?
[5598.00 --> 5599.50]  I don't follow.
[5599.50 --> 5600.50]  I don't follow.
[5600.50 --> 5605.50]  Because you know they're going to do it in bad faith and you shouldn't support that.
[5605.50 --> 5606.50]  Okay.
[5606.50 --> 5615.00]  I mean you can disagree with me and do it anyways.
[5615.00 --> 5616.00]  That's fine.
[5616.00 --> 5620.00]  I mean likely yeah because what are we going to not have an affiliate program?
[5620.00 --> 5622.00]  I think you could have a different style.
[5622.00 --> 5623.00]  We can't.
[5623.00 --> 5624.00]  What different style?
[5624.00 --> 5625.00]  I don't know.
[5625.00 --> 5626.00]  I don't know the space.
[5626.00 --> 5630.00]  Are we going to write $4 checks to like every site on the internet that talks about bags?
[5630.00 --> 5631.00]  You have a minimum.
[5631.00 --> 5632.00]  That's pretty obvious.
[5632.00 --> 5635.00]  Well yeah but that's why nobody does it directly.
[5635.00 --> 5637.00]  Because they're not going to meet those minimums.
[5637.00 --> 5640.00]  They don't want $500 $4 checks.
[5640.00 --> 5642.00]  That's why nobody does it that way.
[5642.00 --> 5643.00]  It's not practical.
[5643.00 --> 5645.00]  It doesn't make any sense.
[5645.00 --> 5648.00]  I am not agreeing with, I'm not disagreeing with you.
[5648.00 --> 5650.00]  That's literally how I just told you it works.
[5650.00 --> 5651.00]  Right.
[5651.00 --> 5652.00]  Okay.
[5652.00 --> 5655.00]  So then, so you're basically just saying okay then give up.
[5655.00 --> 5660.00]  I don't think that you should use personally, and again you don't have to agree with this and you can do it anyway.
[5660.00 --> 5661.00]  Sure.
[5661.00 --> 5662.00]  You can do it anyways.
[5662.00 --> 5671.00]  Personally, I don't think that you should just say there isn't a good solution for us to do this ethically, so we're just going to do it anyways.
[5671.00 --> 5673.00]  But there is a solution for us to do it ethically.
[5673.00 --> 5674.00]  I don't agree.
[5674.00 --> 5677.00]  We are fully disclosing everything that we're doing.
[5677.00 --> 5680.00]  We're being completely above board.
[5680.00 --> 5684.00]  But you know you're working with partners that are going to lie and cheat.
[5684.00 --> 5689.00]  And so, okay.
[5693.00 --> 5694.00]  Do I?
[5697.00 --> 5698.00]  And so...
[5698.00 --> 5699.00]  I think thinking that's not going to happen.
[5699.00 --> 5704.00]  That's like saying we shouldn't build hammers because someone will hurt someone with it.
[5704.00 --> 5705.00]  I don't know.
[5705.00 --> 5706.00]  That is literally not...
[5706.00 --> 5707.00]  Yes, it is.
[5707.00 --> 5716.00]  All we're doing is engaging a platform that allows people to legitimately use it and also allows people to not legitimately use it.
[5716.00 --> 5718.00]  We cannot control that.
[5718.00 --> 5721.00]  And integrity checks, like what are you even talking about?
[5721.00 --> 5727.00]  You want them to police the entire internet and make sure these links aren't posted anywhere that it's not properly disclosed?
[5727.00 --> 5728.00]  Who would do that?
[5728.00 --> 5730.00]  If you were running those sites and someone...
[5730.00 --> 5741.00]  If you were running this aggregator thing and someone submitted to you, like, look, this site that's using your thing is not disclosing that any of this is going on.
[5741.00 --> 5743.00]  Would you stop working with them or no?
[5743.00 --> 5745.00]  But I don't run the aggregator.
[5745.00 --> 5746.00]  Okay.
[5746.00 --> 5748.00]  And I can tell you that they don't care.
[5748.00 --> 5751.00]  I'm going nowhere and I don't think there's a point in continuing the conversation.
[5751.00 --> 5752.00]  I think we should just move on to something else.
[5752.00 --> 5753.00]  All right.
[5753.00 --> 5758.00]  So anyway, the situation is...
[5758.00 --> 5763.00]  When it comes to affiliate marketing, it's really...
[5763.00 --> 5765.00]  It's a super gray field.
[5765.00 --> 5766.00]  It's sketchier than I thought.
[5766.00 --> 5767.00]  Yeah.
[5767.00 --> 5770.00]  And I get a lot of emails from companies asking for paid reviews.
[5770.00 --> 5778.00]  I don't even actually monitor the inbox anymore and I still end up getting emails from people asking for paid reviews.
[5778.00 --> 5781.00]  Without any kind of requirements of disclosure.
[5781.00 --> 5788.00]  I mean, I've generally taken the approach that I can't change the entire world.
[5788.00 --> 5800.00]  All I can do is make sure that what we do within the small circle of influence that I managed to maintain is above board.
[5800.00 --> 5811.00]  From my point of view, if we are above board in terms of disclosing that we are offering affiliate programs, that we are on platforms X, Y, or Z.
[5811.00 --> 5812.00]  You know, if...
[5812.00 --> 5813.00]  Okay, yeah.
[5813.00 --> 5814.00]  In...
[5814.00 --> 5815.00]  Sure.
[5815.00 --> 5827.00]  If one of those platforms was found to be writing checks to, you know, some terrorist organization or something like that, that runs a network of beg review sites to help fund illicit activities or whatever.
[5827.00 --> 5836.00]  Like, at the end of the day, anyone supporting, you know, an organized crime syndicate or something like that would be in violation of the law.
[5836.00 --> 5840.00]  Like, if that happened, then yeah, of course, we would stop engaging with that particular platform.
[5840.00 --> 5841.00]  But...
[5842.00 --> 5844.00]  Yeah, I don't know.
[5844.00 --> 5845.00]  I don't know.
[5845.00 --> 5847.00]  This is something I'll have to talk to Nick about.
[5847.00 --> 5851.00]  Maybe you'll have to talk to Nick about because you clearly have a very different perspective from mine.
[5851.00 --> 5852.00]  I also like...
[5853.00 --> 5855.00]  I don't have to agree with everything we do here.
[5855.00 --> 5859.00]  And I don't think it's like the worst thing ever or that big of a deal necessarily.
[5859.00 --> 5861.00]  It's just my position on it.
[5861.00 --> 5862.00]  Sure.
[5862.00 --> 5867.00]  I'm getting people in chat getting very angry on each side.
[5867.00 --> 5869.00]  And I don't think it really matters.
[5869.00 --> 5876.00]  Yeah, I mean, here's the thing, guys, and this is what you've got to at least hopefully recognize, is I didn't have to tell you any of this.
[5876.00 --> 5877.00]  Yeah.
[5877.00 --> 5880.00]  We're having this conversation out in the open.
[5880.00 --> 5881.00]  Almost nobody else would.
[5881.00 --> 5887.00]  So, like, I don't necessarily want people, like, jumping to my defense and diving on Linus or anything.
[5887.00 --> 5889.00]  I don't think any of that's productive.
[5889.00 --> 5890.00]  Yeah.
[5890.00 --> 5893.00]  I don't know a lot about these affiliate programs.
[5893.00 --> 5894.00]  I just think if you...
[5894.00 --> 5897.00]  Yeah, I don't think there's a point in continuing this, to be completely honest.
[5897.00 --> 5898.00]  Yeah.
[5898.00 --> 5902.00]  So, we're trying to be above board with you guys.
[5902.00 --> 5906.00]  We're trying to talk to you guys about, well, here's how it works.
[5906.00 --> 5907.00]  Here are the challenges.
[5907.00 --> 5909.00]  Here are where we...
[5909.00 --> 5912.00]  Here's where we share the same perspective.
[5912.00 --> 5914.00]  Here's where we have different perspectives.
[5914.00 --> 5917.00]  This is the kind of thing that happens a lot internally.
[5917.00 --> 5920.00]  Doesn't necessarily always happen on the WAN show.
[5920.00 --> 5924.00]  But at least you guys are part of the process, I guess.
[5924.00 --> 5931.00]  I've got a lot of people saying, like, hey, yeah, it would tarnish my perception of the LTT brand if I saw the bag in one of those lists.
[5931.00 --> 5932.00]  Like...
[5932.00 --> 5934.00]  Well, okay, but that's also not fair at all.
[5934.00 --> 5935.00]  What are you even talking about?
[5935.00 --> 5936.00]  Because they might just include the bag.
[5936.00 --> 5940.00]  I have seen versions of those lists where they'll, like, rank them.
[5940.00 --> 5942.00]  So, they'll have, like, number one, two, whatever.
[5942.00 --> 5945.00]  And some of those things they won't have affiliate codes for.
[5945.00 --> 5946.00]  And that...
[5946.00 --> 5948.00]  They might not even like that, right?
[5948.00 --> 5950.00]  Because they're not necessarily making money from that.
[5950.00 --> 5952.00]  But they might do that to help legitimize the list.
[5952.00 --> 5954.00]  Or they might have gotten a flat payment for it.
[5954.00 --> 5955.00]  Or that.
[5955.00 --> 5956.00]  Like, you can't...
[5956.00 --> 5957.00]  You can't...
[5957.00 --> 5960.00]  Just because some product shows up in the list, you cannot assume that it was paid to be there.
[5960.00 --> 5961.00]  So, that's not...
[5961.00 --> 5962.00]  This is why...
[5962.00 --> 5967.00]  This is one of the reasons why I don't want people just jumping to, like, really either side.
[5967.00 --> 5970.00]  Because it's an interesting world.
[5970.00 --> 5971.00]  Like, if there's...
[5971.00 --> 5977.00]  If everyone agrees that, like, one product is clearly the best product in a space for a specific thing.
[5977.00 --> 5979.00]  But say it's expensive.
[5979.00 --> 5980.00]  Yeah.
[5980.00 --> 5982.00]  They're still gonna put that at, like, the top.
[5982.00 --> 5984.00]  But just be like, it's expensive.
[5984.00 --> 5986.00]  If you want another option, there's these ones.
[5986.00 --> 5989.00]  That doesn't mean that that company paid to be at the top.
[5989.00 --> 5991.00]  That doesn't mean that that company paid to be on that list.
[5991.00 --> 5992.00]  It's...
[5992.00 --> 5993.00]  Yeah.
[5993.00 --> 5995.00]  There's more to it than that.
[5995.00 --> 5997.00]  Oh, hey!
[5998.00 --> 5999.00]  They're here!
[5999.00 --> 6001.00]  Uh, Luke, do you mind doing up a poll?
[6001.00 --> 6008.00]  So, the three options are Zero Gravity Gaming, Vancouver, and Tech Dinosaurs.
[6008.00 --> 6009.00]  Okay.
[6009.00 --> 6015.00]  Uh, we're trying to figure out what ratio to print for these desk pads.
[6015.00 --> 6021.00]  Because the last thing I wanted was for people to end up with their feelings very, very, very hurt.
[6021.00 --> 6026.00]  Because we had three of our designers each come up with creative ideas.
[6026.00 --> 6031.00]  These are artist edition desk pads that we're doing as part of LTX.
[6031.00 --> 6036.00]  And the last thing I wanted was for one of them to, like, not sell as well as the other two or something.
[6036.00 --> 6038.00]  And be the last one left on the store.
[6038.00 --> 6043.00]  So, that's a huge reason why I'm trying to get some idea of the ratio.
[6043.00 --> 6045.00]  Because that can be opaque to the designers.
[6045.00 --> 6047.00]  They don't have to know how many we ordered.
[6047.00 --> 6051.00]  I just want them to all kind of run out at about the same time.
[6051.00 --> 6053.00]  Uh, oh.
[6053.00 --> 6059.00]  It came from a good place.
[6059.00 --> 6060.00]  It did.
[6060.00 --> 6062.00]  It 100% did.
[6062.00 --> 6063.00]  I don't know how you do this.
[6063.00 --> 6064.00]  This is tough.
[6064.00 --> 6066.00]  Um, well.
[6066.00 --> 6070.00]  Pull it anyway.
[6070.00 --> 6071.00]  Can we send it anyways?
[6071.00 --> 6072.00]  I need to know how many to order.
[6072.00 --> 6073.00]  Okay.
[6073.00 --> 6074.00]  Um, so what is it?
[6074.00 --> 6076.00]  Like, which one do you want to buy?
[6076.00 --> 6077.00]  Yeah, which one?
[6077.00 --> 6080.00]  Uh, oh, you should probably, oh man.
[6080.00 --> 6083.00]  You should probably have an option for like all because there's going to be.
[6083.00 --> 6084.00]  Okay.
[6084.00 --> 6089.00]  Ridiculous whale people that are like, I have three computers and I'm going to buy each of them.
[6089.00 --> 6090.00]  Um, okay.
[6090.00 --> 6091.00]  Is it up?
[6091.00 --> 6092.00]  Uh.
[6092.00 --> 6095.00]  Okay, guys, don't vote yet.
[6095.00 --> 6097.00]  I gotta, I gotta show you what the different options look like.
[6097.00 --> 6099.00]  So this is zero gravity gaming.
[6100.00 --> 6101.00]  All right.
[6102.00 --> 6105.00]  And the design is just to the edges of the pad here.
[6105.00 --> 6106.00]  Okay.
[6106.00 --> 6109.00]  It's not the name and the LTX logo.
[6109.00 --> 6110.00]  It's just, it's just the middle part.
[6110.00 --> 6111.00]  Okay.
[6111.00 --> 6115.00]  Then we've got Vancouver, which is much more vibrant in person, by the way, it's really
[6115.00 --> 6116.00]  poppy.
[6116.00 --> 6117.00]  It looks really great.
[6117.00 --> 6122.00]  And then we've got, uh, tech dinosaurs, which is actually going to be slightly revised.
[6122.00 --> 6124.00]  Um, I think this headphone is changing.
[6124.00 --> 6128.00]  Um, but there's not, there's not too much changing about any of them.
[6128.00 --> 6131.00]  So let's, uh, we'll get the results and then hopefully, okay.
[6131.00 --> 6132.00]  All right.
[6132.00 --> 6136.00]  Well, actually things are, things are not that unevenly split, which is.
[6136.00 --> 6137.00]  Yeah.
[6137.00 --> 6138.00]  It's decently flat.
[6138.00 --> 6139.00]  Okay.
[6139.00 --> 6140.00]  That's good.
[6140.00 --> 6141.00]  All right.
[6141.00 --> 6144.00]  So maybe we'll just go like same quantities of each and just not order too many.
[6144.00 --> 6146.00]  So they all kind of run out fast or something like that.
[6146.00 --> 6149.00]  This is something that like, it's going to be limited.
[6149.00 --> 6151.00]  So yeah.
[6151.00 --> 6152.00]  All right.
[6152.00 --> 6153.00]  What are we talking about now?
[6153.00 --> 6154.00]  Oh, holy crap.
[6154.00 --> 6156.00]  We should do our sponsors.
[6156.00 --> 6157.00]  Oh no.
[6157.00 --> 6159.00]  What are you doing?
[6159.00 --> 6160.00]  You're getting papers again.
[6160.00 --> 6161.00]  This is what it is forever onwards now.
[6161.00 --> 6162.00]  Is it actually?
[6162.00 --> 6163.00]  Oh boy.
[6163.00 --> 6164.00]  This is, this is how it works now.
[6164.00 --> 6165.00]  Get used to it.
[6165.00 --> 6166.00]  Okay.
[6166.00 --> 6167.00]  Uh, well, uh, the show is brought to you by, and do you wait for me to say, and then you.
[6167.00 --> 6168.00]  That's right.
[6168.00 --> 6169.00]  That's right.
[6169.00 --> 6170.00]  As long as you do them in order, I'll be happy.
[6170.00 --> 6171.00]  But, uh, I can work with you.
[6171.00 --> 6172.00]  The show is brought to you by Zoho One.
[6172.00 --> 6176.00]  Thank you Zoho One for sponsoring today's WAN show.
[6176.00 --> 6177.00]  This is a strawberry.
[6177.00 --> 6184.00]  And if you want a strawberry to cover your business's buttocks, you need Zoho One.
[6184.00 --> 6186.00]  Multiple cloud apps, legacy tools, paper, and software.
[6186.00 --> 6187.00]  And I'll see you next time.
[6187.00 --> 6188.00]  I'll see you next time.
[6188.00 --> 6189.00]  I'll see you next time.
[6189.00 --> 6190.00]  I'll see you next time.
[6190.00 --> 6191.00]  I'll see you next time.
[6191.00 --> 6192.00]  Bye.
[6192.00 --> 6193.00]  Bye.
[6193.00 --> 6194.00]  Bye.
[6194.00 --> 6195.00]  Bye.
[6195.00 --> 6196.00]  Bye.
[6196.00 --> 6197.00]  Bye.
[6197.00 --> 6198.00]  Bye.
[6198.00 --> 6199.00]  Bye.
[6199.00 --> 6200.00]  Bye.
[6200.00 --> 6201.00]  Bye.
[6201.00 --> 6202.00]  Bye.
[6202.00 --> 6203.00]  Bye.
[6231.00 --> 6232.00]  Bye.
[6232.00 --> 6233.00]  Bye.
[6233.00 --> 6234.00]  Bye.
[6234.00 --> 6240.34]  Bye
[6241.00 --> 6243.00]  Bye.
[6243.00 --> 6244.00]  Bye.
[6244.00 --> 6245.00]  Bye.
[6245.00 --> 6246.00]  Bye.
[6246.00 --> 6247.08]  Bye.
[6247.08 --> 6250.18]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, something, something, dismissal.
[6250.32 --> 6251.00]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.

[6342.30 --> 6342.78]  Okay.
[6343.06 --> 6344.78]  Thank you for that, Dennis.
[6345.68 --> 6345.98]  All right.
[6346.02 --> 6349.14]  Why don't we pick something that we can agree on for a change?
[6349.78 --> 6350.54]  For a change?
[6350.60 --> 6351.76]  I think we're usually on the same side.
[6351.76 --> 6356.70]  Australia debates mature rating for loot boxes.
[6357.44 --> 6366.80]  A proposal by the government of Australia would apply an R rating and 18 plus restriction to video games containing simulated gambling.
[6367.34 --> 6373.34]  Games containing paid loot boxes would carry at a minimum a mature rating and 15 plus restriction.
[6373.34 --> 6379.58]  It won't be illegal for minors to play these games, but it would be illegal for a minor to buy them.
[6380.00 --> 6382.58]  I'd say that's going to be much harder to enforce in this day and age.
[6382.58 --> 6383.06]  Oh, yeah.
[6383.28 --> 6389.42]  It used to be that at the store, at the point of sale, someone was liable for selling the game to a minor.
[6389.44 --> 6390.84]  It felt like trying to buy alcohol.
[6391.04 --> 6391.50]  But now?
[6391.50 --> 6393.64]  If you wanted to buy Halo when you were underage or something.
[6394.02 --> 6401.08]  But yeah, if you're just digital distribution, it relies on parents to set up restrictions.
[6401.08 --> 6403.32]  And that's so uncommon.
[6403.48 --> 6404.32]  That's another thing, too.
[6404.42 --> 6413.26]  Back to the bubbles conversation we were having earlier, encountering other parents just with no tech savvy filter in my interactions.
[6413.96 --> 6414.44]  Discord?
[6415.20 --> 6419.26]  Are you like the parent tech friend for the people at parents at school?
[6419.26 --> 6421.38]  I don't have time to be the parent tech friend.
[6421.62 --> 6429.64]  But my kid was the first one with a Discord server so that I knew what everyone was talking about and could keep an eye on things.
[6429.64 --> 6433.02]  I haven't even thought about dealing with Discord.
[6433.54 --> 6433.70]  Yeah.
[6434.34 --> 6436.26]  So anyway.
[6436.42 --> 6436.90]  All right.
[6437.38 --> 6443.64]  But yeah, so imagining that parents are practicing proper...
[6444.16 --> 6447.26]  I've heard some of the usage statistics on those tools.
[6447.44 --> 6449.14]  And like, they get used.
[6449.54 --> 6450.70]  They should keep being made.
[6451.02 --> 6453.16]  But it's not that common.
[6453.76 --> 6453.98]  Yeah.
[6454.10 --> 6456.64]  Which is kind of surprising to me because I would think that our generation...
[6456.64 --> 6457.62]  You mean like parental controls?
[6457.62 --> 6457.92]  Yeah.
[6458.92 --> 6459.32]  Yeah.
[6459.44 --> 6460.24]  I don't know.
[6460.42 --> 6462.54]  I mean, it's super easy on a lot of devices.
[6462.74 --> 6464.08]  Like, Nintendo makes it really simple.
[6464.28 --> 6465.62]  I think a lot of people just...
[6466.68 --> 6467.24]  Here, kid.
[6467.28 --> 6468.14]  I bought you the thing.
[6469.18 --> 6469.66]  Have fun.
[6470.54 --> 6470.94]  YOLO!
[6471.20 --> 6471.44]  Yeah.
[6471.60 --> 6472.02]  I don't know.
[6472.78 --> 6473.02]  Anyways.
[6473.32 --> 6477.24]  Especially with, man, the kind of stuff you can access on a phone in like two seconds.
[6477.60 --> 6477.94]  Yeah.
[6479.72 --> 6480.76]  It's actually...
[6480.76 --> 6481.66]  The internet's crazy.
[6481.92 --> 6484.22]  Does SafeSearch even pretend to work anymore?
[6484.22 --> 6487.38]  Like, I'm going to try something.
[6487.78 --> 6488.58]  Go ahead, though.
[6488.58 --> 6488.62]  All right.
[6488.64 --> 6489.02]  Sounds good.
[6490.18 --> 6495.38]  The average gambler using online casino games is typically 45 or older.
[6495.74 --> 6499.72]  However, research typically shows that gambling among teenagers is rising.
[6499.96 --> 6504.22]  And that teens exposed to gambling from a young age are more likely to struggle with gambling...
[6504.76 --> 6507.00]  With a gambling addiction as adults.
[6507.00 --> 6515.50]  I wonder if the gambling among teenagers rising has anything to do with a lot of the gambling creators that have been rising up over the last few years.
[6516.62 --> 6520.68]  Over 80% of adults in Australia engage in some form of gambling.
[6520.98 --> 6521.26]  Whoa.
[6521.64 --> 6522.90]  The highest rate in the world.
[6523.08 --> 6523.26]  Okay.
[6523.54 --> 6523.84]  Okay.
[6523.86 --> 6524.32]  That makes sense.
[6524.60 --> 6529.60]  With around 1% of the population suffering serious consequences due to problem gambling.
[6529.80 --> 6531.54]  That's really high.
[6531.66 --> 6534.96]  Because I wonder what serious consequences means.
[6534.96 --> 6539.04]  And it's probably actually, like, quite serious.
[6539.04 --> 6540.26]  Because that would be...
[6540.26 --> 6541.20]  That would require reporting.
[6541.76 --> 6547.02]  The change would affect many games that are currently rated G, such as FIFA.
[6547.96 --> 6548.46]  Whoa.
[6548.76 --> 6554.70]  But also games with gambling minigames, such as the slot machines in early-gen Pokemon.
[6556.56 --> 6557.12]  Oh.
[6557.66 --> 6558.82]  I didn't even think about that.
[6558.82 --> 6561.62]  Normalizing gambling with little kids is actually a huge problem.
[6561.96 --> 6562.30]  Yeah.
[6562.30 --> 6567.26]  I'm glad that they're trying to do something, but I do worry about what the effectiveness will be.
[6567.48 --> 6569.68]  Where we're relying on...
[6569.68 --> 6573.86]  A lot of open world games have some form of casino.
[6574.32 --> 6574.70]  Sure.
[6575.26 --> 6584.36]  And where's the line between a loot box that is actually paid and a gambling-like or loot box-like game mechanic?
[6584.36 --> 6590.96]  I mean, is the entire game of Pokemon just a giant gambling machine?
[6594.70 --> 6596.92]  Because of, like, walking in the grass, you don't know what you're going to find.
[6596.94 --> 6597.18]  Just RNG.
[6597.34 --> 6599.04]  It might take you two hours to get that Abra.
[6599.48 --> 6599.62]  Yeah.
[6599.82 --> 6602.02]  And that you might be able to trade for real money with a friend.
[6603.48 --> 6604.74]  Especially with internet connectivity.
[6605.02 --> 6605.20]  Yeah.
[6605.40 --> 6607.58]  They also go on to mention Stardew Valley.
[6607.74 --> 6610.00]  The thing that jumped into my head was Fallout New Vegas.
[6610.38 --> 6610.62]  Yeah.
[6610.62 --> 6612.06]  Like, you can...
[6612.06 --> 6612.22]  Yeah.
[6612.54 --> 6613.28]  It's in Vegas.
[6613.38 --> 6614.44]  You can gamble in Fallout.
[6614.74 --> 6615.88]  Does that make it a gambling game?
[6615.92 --> 6617.88]  I wouldn't immediately think that, but it's interesting.
[6618.22 --> 6618.84]  Discussion question.
[6619.16 --> 6623.18]  If these kinds of laws become widespread, how would it affect game development?
[6623.52 --> 6625.26]  Should this be adopted elsewhere?
[6625.96 --> 6626.62]  I mean...
[6626.62 --> 6632.34]  Like we just said.
[6632.82 --> 6634.22]  It's been interesting.
[6635.22 --> 6635.96]  No, you can go for it.
[6636.00 --> 6641.28]  It's been interesting watching gambling get deregulated in real time in our lives.
[6641.54 --> 6641.94]  Yeah.
[6642.08 --> 6644.74]  Like, watching ads for sports.
[6645.20 --> 6648.62]  It's just constantly, like, you want to gamble on the results of the game?
[6649.66 --> 6650.06]  Whoa.
[6650.06 --> 6654.52]  It was always under the table, back alley stuff when we were growing up.
[6654.92 --> 6656.86]  And now it's, like, very in your face all the time.
[6656.88 --> 6657.06]  Yeah.
[6657.12 --> 6663.02]  Like, it's kind of like going down to the States and every other ad on TV is for a pharmaceutical product.
[6663.32 --> 6663.96]  That's weird.
[6664.40 --> 6664.64]  Yeah.
[6664.88 --> 6665.94]  It weirds me out.
[6666.08 --> 6672.06]  So you're not allowed to advertise pharmaceutical products in Canada.
[6672.34 --> 6674.96]  At least not in the same way that you can in the States.
[6674.96 --> 6678.84]  Like, you won't just see a commercial on TV for Cialis or whatever.
[6681.30 --> 6682.72]  And so it's jarring.
[6682.92 --> 6683.90]  It's, like, really jarring.
[6684.14 --> 6691.54]  And in the same way, growing up as kids where gambling was a thing that, you know, know your limit, play within it.
[6691.60 --> 6697.38]  You know, like, I know the anti-gambling slogans far better than I know the gambling slogans.
[6697.38 --> 6708.48]  And as someone who hasn't had a TV service, like, a paid TV service as an adult and can't see ads, whenever I do see a gambling ad, it's like, whoa, really?
[6708.88 --> 6709.76]  You could do that?
[6710.92 --> 6716.46]  I thought we actually invest, like, public funding in making sure people don't do that.
[6716.66 --> 6719.04]  And then, but then, okay, sure.
[6719.24 --> 6720.34]  I guess, all right.
[6720.36 --> 6721.54]  I guess that's how it works now, right?
[6723.42 --> 6724.22]  Yeah, it's odd.
[6724.22 --> 6736.34]  I do find the, just to jump on the pharmaceuticals thing, I know this has probably been memed to death, but it is so funny that, like, over half of the pharmaceutical ad is this gigantic disclaimer about how it can do horrible things to you.
[6736.58 --> 6738.06]  I always find that very entertaining.
[6738.16 --> 6743.90]  Oh, the Canadian regulation, according to Twitch chat, which is very reliable, apparently you can say the medication name.
[6743.96 --> 6746.78]  Because, yeah, as soon as I said that, I was like, no, I think I've seen a commercial for Cialis.
[6746.96 --> 6747.98]  You can say the name.
[6748.68 --> 6750.88]  You can say what it does, but not both.
[6751.90 --> 6752.22]  Oh.
[6752.22 --> 6759.32]  So it's kind of like, you know how alcohol commercials, sometime in our lifetime, they change, so you couldn't actually show people drinking it.
[6760.28 --> 6760.64]  Oh.
[6760.84 --> 6762.14]  You could show people holding it.
[6762.40 --> 6763.52]  You could show it being poured.
[6763.74 --> 6767.06]  You could show them having fun and being, like, you know, hot or whatever.
[6767.88 --> 6769.26]  But you couldn't actually.
[6769.26 --> 6771.54]  Yeah, you always see them fill the glass, but then they just stand there.
[6771.70 --> 6772.92]  I never, like, thought about this.
[6772.92 --> 6773.04]  Yeah.
[6773.10 --> 6773.62]  That's funny.
[6774.80 --> 6775.16]  Interesting.
[6775.40 --> 6777.06]  Yeah, it's a whole, it's a whole thing.
[6777.06 --> 6785.72]  I think it could definitely affect things, but I feel like this law would affect things significantly more if it was implemented.
[6787.16 --> 6791.56]  Like you were saying earlier, when people were buying all of their games physically and in person.
[6791.78 --> 6791.98]  Yeah.
[6791.98 --> 6796.74]  As it is now, you just VPN into whatever region deregulates it.
[6796.74 --> 6797.46]  Doesn't have that restriction.
[6797.48 --> 6799.64]  And game developers are not going to care.
[6799.76 --> 6802.00]  They're going to be like, yeah, what do I care if they do that?
[6802.30 --> 6809.22]  And then if we ever worked with a game developer, Luke would lose his shit because we're supporting bad people somehow.
[6809.32 --> 6811.66]  I said you could do it anyways, and I don't need to do everything.
[6811.78 --> 6813.40]  I did not lose my shit.
[6813.40 --> 6816.98]  Oh, my goodness.
[6818.44 --> 6821.64]  I'm going to take a shot back by talking about an AI topic.
[6822.94 --> 6824.04]  Actually, hold on, hold on.
[6824.16 --> 6826.72]  Can I just try to defeat SafeSearch in like...
[6826.72 --> 6827.44]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6827.44 --> 6828.48]  Let's see how long it takes.
[6828.64 --> 6832.84]  I'm going to start with boobies, which presumably will be birds.
[6832.98 --> 6833.20]  Birds!
[6833.54 --> 6833.82]  Okay.
[6834.26 --> 6834.62]  Okay.
[6835.62 --> 6836.00]  Oh.
[6836.42 --> 6837.86]  Nope, that didn't take long.
[6837.92 --> 6838.88]  Not if you click on images.
[6840.46 --> 6842.98]  There's, this Obama one is pretty good.
[6842.98 --> 6843.92]  That is kind of funny.
[6847.36 --> 6848.34]  That's actually a thing.
[6848.44 --> 6848.72]  Okay.
[6848.84 --> 6849.00]  Yeah.
[6849.02 --> 6850.06]  It gets pretty...
[6850.06 --> 6852.74]  Gets pretty racy, pretty fast.
[6852.92 --> 6853.10]  Yep.
[6855.46 --> 6855.86]  Yep.
[6856.04 --> 6856.30]  Yep.
[6856.54 --> 6858.44]  There's a lot of birds, in fairness.
[6858.82 --> 6861.00]  And it seems like it goes through phases.
[6861.54 --> 6865.66]  Like there was birds, and then there was pictures that you would expect if you weren't on SafeSearch.
[6865.90 --> 6867.24]  And then there was...
[6867.24 --> 6868.06]  Did it just stop you?
[6868.06 --> 6870.74]  I add nude, and it says results hidden.
[6871.38 --> 6872.56]  To see results.
[6872.96 --> 6874.22]  Manage your SafeSearch settings.
[6876.86 --> 6877.34]  Okay.
[6877.66 --> 6880.76]  If you were on a kid account, I'm assuming it wouldn't give you that option.
[6881.92 --> 6882.40]  Yeah.
[6882.98 --> 6883.26]  I don't know.
[6883.26 --> 6884.80]  Yeah, I guess that's possible.
[6884.88 --> 6890.90]  But again, that assumes that I am managing the kid's account properly.
[6891.90 --> 6892.14]  Right?
[6892.14 --> 6893.40]  But there's even like...
[6893.40 --> 6894.28]  And there's...
[6894.28 --> 6895.30]  Like you think of Nintendo.
[6895.62 --> 6902.84]  Like Nintendo's probably the company that I would say most promotes its parental controls.
[6903.18 --> 6903.54]  Sure.
[6903.64 --> 6904.32]  If that makes sense.
[6904.32 --> 6910.42]  People are still using like Nintendo DS's browser back in the day to look at stuff.
[6910.90 --> 6914.12]  Like people are going to find a way.
[6915.56 --> 6916.58]  It's going to happen.
[6916.58 --> 6918.18]  Anyways.
[6919.30 --> 6922.92]  A ton of stuff happened in AI, but we only have one main topic.
[6923.56 --> 6926.96]  I will kind of loop in a couple things into this topic, but it is what it is.
[6926.96 --> 6931.40]  AI experts advocate pause on high-level AI development.
[6931.40 --> 6944.48]  Over 1,000 experts, including engineers, researchers, and notable tech luminaries, have signed an open letter asking for a six-month pause to development of AI beyond the bounds already reached by GPT-4.
[6944.70 --> 6957.16]  Their argument is that in the recent rush to develop AI systems, we have not had the necessary time as a global society to fully consider the risks of developing human competitive AI intelligence.
[6957.16 --> 6965.92]  The letter further argues that if private entities are unwilling to restrict themselves voluntarily, governments should step in to regulate AI development.
[6966.16 --> 6969.02]  Some notable signatories include Elon Musk.
[6969.08 --> 6970.24]  Can I stop that for a second?
[6972.02 --> 6972.88]  Stop what?
[6973.64 --> 6977.70]  Isn't he like anti-government regulations?
[6978.60 --> 6982.76]  Could he be less consistent in some way?
[6983.02 --> 6985.62]  Is that possible for him to be less consistent?
[6985.62 --> 6986.26]  To...
[6986.26 --> 6998.46]  To throw him a bone in this scenario, he has been highly concerned about AI for a super long time and been calling for regulation for a super long time.
[6998.64 --> 6998.92]  Yes.
[6999.74 --> 7000.18]  Yes.
[7000.58 --> 7004.68]  But he only calls for regulation when it doesn't affect him.
[7005.52 --> 7006.18]  So that's consistent.
[7006.18 --> 7007.08]  This regulation...
[7007.08 --> 7007.50]  Oh, okay.
[7007.56 --> 7007.84]  Hold on.
[7007.98 --> 7008.18]  Okay.
[7008.26 --> 7011.44]  I'm going to pause my response to that because I want to finish the notes, but I have a...
[7011.44 --> 7013.92]  I'm going to jump on your side in a moment.
[7013.92 --> 7014.36]  Yeah.
[7015.18 --> 7016.06]  This has led to...
[7016.06 --> 7019.86]  Elon Musk, Stephen Wozniak, and the CEO of Stability AI.
[7020.14 --> 7028.60]  This has led to criticisms that the true motive behind some signatories is to slow down AI development so that their own AI investments can catch up to the competition.
[7028.94 --> 7029.74]  Now we're done the notes.
[7029.98 --> 7030.78]  I'm going to jump back on that.
[7030.78 --> 7038.30]  I'm very certain that this is specifically, at least as far as Elon is concerned, trying to target open AI.
[7038.46 --> 7039.70]  Because he's really mad.
[7042.90 --> 7046.92]  Because this will 100% only target open AI right now.
[7047.16 --> 7052.74]  There's all these articles about how Google's bard is literally trained on GPT-4 outputs.
[7052.74 --> 7055.00]  There was this website.
[7055.10 --> 7055.76]  I don't remember what it was.
[7055.84 --> 7064.76]  I don't think it was ran by open AI, but it was like a collection of people's conversations that they had had that they submit to the website so people can see all these different conversations that have been had.
[7064.90 --> 7067.36]  And they were training it off of that website.
[7068.06 --> 7074.58]  They were trying to get bard's results more similar to the results that they were seeing in that website.
[7074.74 --> 7075.00]  Right.
[7075.00 --> 7076.86]  And they got caught doing this.
[7077.24 --> 7078.90]  And open AI knows they did it.
[7080.22 --> 7082.46]  They are absolutely the target of this.
[7082.62 --> 7097.92]  Also, I have no faith whatsoever that we, because we're talking about the global community, would be able to come to some conclusion in the next six months about how this is going to go.
[7098.06 --> 7101.10]  The global community can't come to a conclusion about anything.
[7102.02 --> 7104.04]  Like not murdering each other all the time.
[7104.04 --> 7104.30]  Yeah.
[7104.54 --> 7105.86]  We can't agree that that's a good idea.
[7105.86 --> 7107.48]  We're going to get nowhere with this.
[7107.74 --> 7107.98]  Yeah.
[7108.26 --> 7116.16]  Also, like if, let's say, the government of a very large militarized company, or country, sorry.
[7116.34 --> 7116.90]  Yeah, same diff.
[7117.46 --> 7120.12]  If they wanted the benefits.
[7120.80 --> 7123.14]  Well, it's not me with the spicy take this week.
[7123.42 --> 7126.98]  If they wanted the benefits of some system, you think they're going to pause it?
[7128.14 --> 7128.62]  No.
[7129.56 --> 7130.06]  Of course not.
[7130.32 --> 7130.54]  Yeah.
[7131.94 --> 7132.76]  I don't know.
[7132.76 --> 7141.44]  I, in like a everything goes perfect world, like sure, let's slow it down and figure out how we're going to do things.
[7141.44 --> 7144.66]  But like people that have, if, if these exist.
[7145.00 --> 7145.28]  Yeah.
[7145.28 --> 7151.84]  If there are competitive systems with GPT-4 right now that just aren't public for whatever reason, held by governments or other companies or whatever.
[7152.06 --> 7153.24]  You think they're going to stop?
[7153.50 --> 7154.34]  No, of course not.
[7154.34 --> 7156.34]  No shock.
[7156.34 --> 7157.06]  No shock.
[7157.20 --> 7160.32]  Even if you told them to stop and they were like, yeah, we stopped.
[7160.46 --> 7161.32]  They're just going to keep going anyways.
[7161.60 --> 7163.98]  Like what, what is everyone who works there going to do?
[7164.36 --> 7164.60]  Yeah.
[7164.74 --> 7167.20]  Twiddle their, play, play ping pong for six months?
[7167.34 --> 7169.58]  Like, there's probably other stuff that they can do too.
[7169.68 --> 7170.86]  This is another thing I thought of.
[7170.86 --> 7175.94]  Like if this somehow does go through, you think OpenAID is just going to completely sit on their hands?
[7176.46 --> 7177.12]  Yeah, of course not.
[7177.14 --> 7179.66]  They'll just build like other supporting things.
[7179.82 --> 7179.98]  Yeah.
[7179.98 --> 7182.48]  So that when they're able to work on it again, they just ramp even further.
[7184.24 --> 7185.08]  I don't know.
[7185.08 --> 7190.94]  Some of the development that's happened around GPT-4 and the hook stuff is really crazy.
[7191.26 --> 7194.98]  My account doesn't have access to plugins, so I haven't been able to do it myself.
[7195.56 --> 7198.44]  But watching it, I've seen other people's results.
[7198.86 --> 7204.06]  Watching it use the plugins to think has been pretty wild.
[7204.42 --> 7209.98]  Because like I've known about Wolfram Alpha for a long time, which is that like math tool.
[7210.52 --> 7213.16]  I didn't, I haven't used it since I was in university.
[7213.16 --> 7217.34]  I didn't realize that its error output is written in like human language.
[7218.06 --> 7219.10]  Oh, that's cool.
[7219.58 --> 7221.58]  That helps GPT-4 a lot.
[7221.98 --> 7222.12]  Right.
[7223.12 --> 7234.28]  There's also people that are already setting up tools, making it so that even without the support of OpenAI, they have, like there's a paper on this.
[7234.34 --> 7235.12]  Someone wrote a paper on it.
[7235.12 --> 7236.28]  It's extremely interesting.
[7236.28 --> 7250.10]  Where they set up a system, a series of tools that all conversed back and forth so that they were able to externally make the project that OpenAI was talking about, about giving OpenAI access to itself.
[7250.10 --> 7255.82]  Because they just linked multiple accounts together through one controller.
[7256.22 --> 7256.44]  Yeah.
[7256.44 --> 7263.80]  And then they gave the controller the task of telling the other accounts that they're like, what their job is in the queue and getting everything built.
[7264.00 --> 7266.66]  And it's all happening.
[7266.92 --> 7268.92]  It doesn't matter if you tell them to pause.
[7269.00 --> 7270.52]  They're going to keep going anyways.
[7270.70 --> 7270.92]  Yeah.
[7270.92 --> 7278.32]  If it's not, like if you put tons of watchdogs on OpenAI, I'm sure they'll find some way to work on something.
[7278.68 --> 7286.60]  OpenAI as a organization, as far as I can tell, which this could just be them trying to convince me and succeeding.
[7286.90 --> 7287.66]  I have no idea.
[7287.92 --> 7292.82]  As far as I can tell, they are somewhat concerned about the ethics of all this kind of stuff.
[7293.42 --> 7295.28]  But they're marching forward anyways.
[7296.02 --> 7297.38]  That's what people are going to do.
[7297.76 --> 7297.90]  Yep.
[7298.36 --> 7300.84]  We are actually going to destroy ourselves.
[7301.08 --> 7301.36]  Oh, yeah.
[7301.44 --> 7302.36]  We all know that, right?
[7302.48 --> 7302.68]  Yeah.
[7303.28 --> 7304.06]  Like for sure.
[7304.50 --> 7304.74]  Yep.
[7305.86 --> 7311.96]  I was talking to you about a thing that I don't know if I want to say yet because I don't want to like claim it until I'm more sure.
[7312.64 --> 7316.82]  But another project that I thought that's been really cool is, do you know about Llama?
[7317.62 --> 7317.96]  Yeah.
[7318.40 --> 7319.64]  So it's like locally ran.
[7320.32 --> 7325.02]  People have set up like microphone arrays in their house.
[7325.02 --> 7339.54]  And someone posted a project where they made it so that they use Siri voice whatever through a MacBook to write into like Llama input so that they could converse with it back and forth through voice.
[7339.54 --> 7344.90]  And I know someone else who's been setting up a microphone array in their house so that they have like a Jarvis.
[7345.58 --> 7348.30]  Like that project is happening now.
[7348.80 --> 7349.02]  Yeah.
[7349.02 --> 7352.90]  You're not going to stop this stuff.
[7352.90 --> 7361.48]  And especially when you get to the point where people can just ask ChatGPT to write whatever plug-in or whatever hook they need.
[7361.48 --> 7368.90]  Because like the problem right now is that these voice assistants or AI assistants or whatever, they can't do anything.
[7369.00 --> 7370.56]  You have no reason to talk to them.
[7370.56 --> 7391.46]  But if any idiot with vocal cords can just say, or hands, or any way of inputting text can just say, oh, write a thing so that ChatGPT or Llama or whatever can control my smart blinds.
[7391.76 --> 7392.80]  Here's the brand.
[7393.04 --> 7394.88]  Find them on my network or whatever.
[7396.42 --> 7399.46]  It'll actually do stuff, which is cool.
[7399.46 --> 7399.96]  Yeah.
[7401.16 --> 7401.98]  It's interesting.
[7402.64 --> 7402.88]  Yeah.
[7402.90 --> 7403.66]  Good luck, everybody.
[7403.96 --> 7406.68]  What is your thoughts on the pause?
[7407.60 --> 7408.94]  Well, it's just asinine.
[7409.16 --> 7410.04]  Good luck with that.
[7411.12 --> 7413.06]  It's like...
[7413.06 --> 7416.64]  How do you think they would even try to enforce something like this?
[7416.66 --> 7421.74]  I think it's like a ceasefire in a traditional war.
[7422.90 --> 7423.18]  Yeah.
[7423.24 --> 7426.92]  Just because we're not firing rounds doesn't mean we're going to stop manufacturing them.
[7426.92 --> 7430.44]  Everyone's just going to super focus on logistics and troop movement and intelligence.
[7430.56 --> 7431.62]  And all this other type of stuff.
[7431.88 --> 7432.88]  So that they're as ready as...
[7432.88 --> 7436.80]  Think about peace in civilization.
[7437.34 --> 7440.06]  We were talking about Civ earlier in the show.
[7440.42 --> 7442.12]  What happens when you declare peace in civilization?
[7442.38 --> 7445.34]  You both build up as much as you can because it ends in 10 turns.
[7445.34 --> 7446.34]  Like...
[7446.34 --> 7447.70]  Let's go!
[7447.90 --> 7448.62]  It's coming.
[7449.14 --> 7449.64]  I don't know.
[7450.16 --> 7452.84]  Atomic Age Ace, I think, has it nailed down.
[7452.92 --> 7456.52]  What we really need is an AI trained entirely off of Twitch chat.
[7456.52 --> 7457.52]  Sorry.
[7459.56 --> 7460.06]  I just...
[7460.06 --> 7460.96]  That amused me.
[7461.06 --> 7461.98]  It was in the float plane chat.
[7462.30 --> 7462.76]  Oh, geez.
[7462.98 --> 7481.48]  Like, that's a way that they could work on it without making it better necessarily is something that's been brought up is that making an AI that is, like, good in the sense of, like, good natured, bad natured, whatever, is basically impossible due to all the different cultures in the world.
[7481.48 --> 7487.64]  Because you're gonna be like, my morals are good, but that's not necessarily gonna line up with someone somewhere else.
[7488.00 --> 7492.86]  So you almost need to make it so that those parts are, like, modular?
[7493.88 --> 7494.40]  Right.
[7494.76 --> 7496.80]  So, like...
[7496.80 --> 7498.48]  Oh, man.
[7499.52 --> 7499.98]  You know what?
[7500.30 --> 7500.68]  I am not...
[7500.68 --> 7502.18]  It gets really messy really fast.
[7502.18 --> 7511.46]  I am not gonna pick a polarizing issue to say, like, that could be a module that you would unplug or replug depending on the part of...
[7511.46 --> 7513.92]  ...of the world that the AI is operating in.
[7514.24 --> 7516.10]  Or political affiliation or whatever else.
[7516.10 --> 7516.86]  Yeah, exactly.
[7517.22 --> 7517.40]  Yeah.
[7517.88 --> 7521.36]  But, like, is that the right route to go?
[7523.46 --> 7524.14]  I don't know.
[7524.22 --> 7536.08]  I've seen some people big mad about AIs spitting out, like, objectively factual stances on some very polarizing issues.
[7536.08 --> 7536.40]  Oh, yeah.
[7536.40 --> 7544.54]  That significant portions of the population do not understand well enough to know that that's actually just a way better answer than what they think.
[7545.94 --> 7547.72]  It's, like, big mad.
[7548.20 --> 7548.50]  So...
[7548.50 --> 7549.04]  Biased!
[7549.04 --> 7549.08]  Biased!
[7550.24 --> 7550.72]  Um...
[7550.72 --> 7554.44]  So it's, like, they could spend this six month...
[7554.44 --> 7555.50]  Six months...
[7555.50 --> 7555.72]  Yeah.
[7555.72 --> 7557.44]  ...trying to tackle, like, that problem.
[7558.28 --> 7560.40]  That doesn't technically advance its...
[7560.40 --> 7561.46]  They probably just won't bother.
[7561.62 --> 7561.94]  I don't know.
[7563.38 --> 7564.22]  I don't know.
[7564.50 --> 7564.82]  It's...
[7564.82 --> 7565.78]  There's...
[7565.78 --> 7566.06]  Yeah.
[7566.24 --> 7567.14]  It's gonna be interesting.
[7568.24 --> 7568.66]  Yeah.
[7569.04 --> 7571.04]  The future is very...
[7571.04 --> 7574.54]  Uncertain.
[7574.54 --> 7580.52]  I feel bad for people that are in, like, you know, like, late high school right now.
[7581.70 --> 7586.62]  Because you're in that stage where you're like, okay, I'm leaving the, like...
[7586.62 --> 7587.48]  The nursery.
[7587.92 --> 7590.68]  The standard required education system.
[7590.90 --> 7592.12]  The walkthrough.
[7592.84 --> 7596.06]  I have to go to either school or get a job or whatever.
[7596.48 --> 7600.68]  What career path do I put myself on when I have very low experience?
[7600.68 --> 7607.10]  Because a lot of the jobs that are most at risk are non-expert style positions.
[7607.48 --> 7607.64]  Yeah.
[7607.74 --> 7613.72]  But then how do you get to an expert style position if you can't gain job work experience?
[7614.42 --> 7621.06]  So, like, if everyone just replaces all the low-level jobs, how do you fill the positions of the high-level jobs?
[7621.06 --> 7622.10]  So we become batteries.
[7624.40 --> 7625.66]  Tell me more, Neo.
[7626.08 --> 7627.14]  Oh, my God.
[7627.80 --> 7629.16]  We already are.
[7629.16 --> 7631.02]  Oh, man.
[7631.90 --> 7633.54]  Aren't we all just training data?
[7633.84 --> 7635.24]  Let's move on.
[7635.26 --> 7635.46]  All right.
[7635.52 --> 7636.46]  I have to run to the washroom.
[7636.54 --> 7641.30]  Do you want to go through some of the exciting creators who have confirmed their attendance at LTX?
[7641.32 --> 7641.66]  Yes.
[7641.92 --> 7642.64]  Where is this?
[7643.76 --> 7644.20]  At the bottom.
[7644.88 --> 7649.14]  We have a bunch of creators confirming their attendance to LTX 2023.
[7649.74 --> 7651.38]  Including Linus Tech Tips.
[7652.28 --> 7652.72]  Whoa.
[7653.44 --> 7654.20]  Tech Wiki.
[7654.90 --> 7655.26]  Whoa.
[7655.80 --> 7657.38]  I guess we should probably share my screen.
[7657.84 --> 7658.22]  There we go.
[7658.22 --> 7668.02]  Outside of our own channels, there's i3cubed, 3D Printing Nerd, Ant Venom, Bad Seed Tech, Barnacles, Brandon Wiley.
[7668.30 --> 7668.72]  Oh, my God.
[7668.74 --> 7669.14]  He's coming?
[7669.44 --> 7669.80]  Whoa.
[7670.28 --> 7670.92]  I love that guy.

[7672.46 --> 7674.12]  Dawid does tech stuff.
[7674.24 --> 7675.40]  I'm pretty sure that's how you pronounce it.
[7675.44 --> 7676.44]  I've heard it said before.
[7676.44 --> 7678.14]  Gear Seekers.

[7684.98 --> 7685.38]  There we go.
[7685.42 --> 7685.82]  I got there.
[7686.06 --> 7686.82]  Level One Techs.

[7700.72 --> 7703.26]  And this is Tech Today and UFD Tech.
[7703.82 --> 7704.76]  Subject to change.
[7704.92 --> 7705.88]  Because there might be more.
[7706.16 --> 7707.50]  Or maybe someone can't make it.
[7707.76 --> 7709.74]  But that's pretty cool.
[7709.80 --> 7710.54]  That's the wrong camera.
[7710.88 --> 7711.32]  Cam only.
[7711.42 --> 7712.36]  That's still the wrong camera.
[7712.56 --> 7713.34]  There we go.
[7713.48 --> 7714.62]  I made it eventually.
[7714.82 --> 7716.74]  There's so many people that I would love to meet there.
[7717.52 --> 7718.18]  Well, you're going to.
[7718.68 --> 7719.34]  That's weird.
[7719.34 --> 7721.58]  I don't like this feeling.
[7721.74 --> 7722.42]  It's strange.
[7722.56 --> 7722.90]  Why?
[7723.14 --> 7723.56]  I don't know.
[7723.64 --> 7724.20]  I'm new at this.
[7726.62 --> 7727.02]  What?
[7727.22 --> 7727.94]  I don't know.
[7727.94 --> 7729.78]  I work with Linus.
[7729.94 --> 7731.34]  And I'm like, he's my co-worker.
[7731.98 --> 7734.62]  And then I go to this and I see other big stars.
[7734.78 --> 7735.16]  I'm like, oh.
[7735.50 --> 7737.24]  Did you watch the channel?
[7737.34 --> 7738.62]  Were you a fan of the channel before you joined?
[7738.92 --> 7739.66]  Yes and no.
[7739.74 --> 7742.16]  But yeah, probably from the very early days.
[7742.72 --> 7742.88]  Yeah.
[7743.36 --> 7743.68]  Okay.
[7743.80 --> 7745.50]  Was it weird meeting Linus for the first time?
[7746.64 --> 7747.04]  No.
[7747.32 --> 7748.18]  Then I think you'll be fine.
[7748.28 --> 7748.92]  I would say no.
[7749.12 --> 7749.76]  Yeah, you'll be fine.
[7749.90 --> 7750.04]  Yeah.
[7750.34 --> 7750.84]  Yeah, it's okay.
[7753.00 --> 7755.04]  Should I go into another topic?
[7755.32 --> 7756.22]  I mean, what else you got?
[7756.22 --> 7758.06]  Well, Linus plans to...
[7758.06 --> 7760.00]  Do you want me to do some merch messages for you?
[7760.10 --> 7760.48]  Merch messages?
[7760.48 --> 7760.80]  Sure.
[7760.94 --> 7761.10]  Yeah.
[7761.16 --> 7762.68]  If there's any targeted towards me, let's do that.
[7762.76 --> 7763.78]  I think there's a few here.
[7764.04 --> 7764.36]  Yeah.
[7765.64 --> 7766.86]  Let me see if I can find some.
[7767.10 --> 7767.36]  All right.
[7767.44 --> 7768.02]  For Luke.
[7768.24 --> 7768.48]  Yeah.
[7768.56 --> 7772.16]  What scale of infrastructure is required to run float plane?
[7772.42 --> 7774.20]  Can you reveal your server count?
[7774.20 --> 7780.04]  That isn't something that I particularly keep track?
[7780.30 --> 7781.08]  Or bandwidth usage?
[7781.08 --> 7782.08]  That's also up and down.
[7783.04 --> 7784.42]  The bandwidth usage...
[7784.42 --> 7785.40]  I wonder if I can find it.
[7785.74 --> 7789.30]  My phone is hidden way under the table because it was doing lots of interference.
[7789.60 --> 7795.78]  The bandwidth usage that happened when we got banned off of YouTube was absurd.
[7795.78 --> 7798.56]  It was this absolutely enormous spike.
[7799.06 --> 7801.66]  And it didn't immediately just go down.
[7801.96 --> 7805.02]  We thought, oh, we're back live on YouTube again.
[7805.26 --> 7806.38]  The account is unbanned.
[7806.78 --> 7810.50]  We're expecting float plane traffic to drop now.
[7810.82 --> 7812.24]  And it was like, nah.
[7813.54 --> 7815.18]  People are actually just using it.
[7815.28 --> 7816.02]  And it's pretty cool.
[7816.14 --> 7817.48]  Did you go through all the creators already?
[7817.52 --> 7817.86]  Pretty wild.
[7818.04 --> 7818.22]  Yeah.
[7818.78 --> 7819.06]  Okay.
[7819.56 --> 7822.42]  Did you clarify that this is to the best of their ability?
[7822.60 --> 7823.72]  And if things happen, things happen?
[7823.72 --> 7825.46]  Yeah, subject to change, there might be more.
[7825.60 --> 7826.92]  Some people might not be able to make it.
[7826.98 --> 7827.52]  Stuff like that.
[7828.04 --> 7829.54]  There will almost certainly be more.
[7829.80 --> 7831.52]  But there may be less.
[7831.88 --> 7832.56]  You never know.
[7832.70 --> 7834.20]  And there are no hard feelings.
[7834.56 --> 7835.12]  Life happens.
[7835.24 --> 7837.36]  It could also be super last minute, right?
[7837.44 --> 7837.62]  Yep.
[7838.10 --> 7838.50]  Absolutely.
[7838.78 --> 7839.26]  Who knows?
[7840.74 --> 7841.48]  So, yeah.
[7841.74 --> 7844.14]  But yeah, bandwidth is high.
[7844.14 --> 7846.86]  And server count is also high.
[7846.98 --> 7849.80]  But then we also scale into public cloud infrastructure.
[7849.98 --> 7850.84]  So how do you count that?
[7850.92 --> 7851.38]  I don't know.
[7851.74 --> 7851.84]  Yeah.
[7851.84 --> 7854.62]  Moving on.
[7855.12 --> 7855.56]  Topic?
[7856.36 --> 7859.76]  Should we talk about the changes to Twitter Blue slash Legacy Verification?
[7860.10 --> 7860.54]  Sure.
[7860.74 --> 7861.62]  I don't even know what they are.
[7861.64 --> 7864.52]  I was kind of eloned out for a long time there.
[7864.64 --> 7866.14]  But this is a pretty big change.
[7866.38 --> 7866.40]  We back?
[7866.98 --> 7872.40]  This is like he's reached the end game now of destroying the platform.
[7872.94 --> 7873.88]  Where is this?
[7874.32 --> 7877.74]  Twitter Legacy Verification will be sunsetting tomorrow.
[7878.62 --> 7881.66]  Note, this does not appear to be an April Fool's joke.
[7881.84 --> 7883.38]  Very amazingly timed, though.
[7883.56 --> 7883.72]  Yeah.
[7883.88 --> 7895.32]  Corporations and organizations that are looking to retain their verified status will have to pay $1,000 a month for their main account, plus $50 a month for any additional accounts.
[7895.44 --> 7897.62]  So that would be any users?
[7897.90 --> 7899.28]  All the user accounts are $50?
[7899.62 --> 7901.24]  Corporations and organizations.
[7901.24 --> 7902.14]  Okay, okay.
[7902.14 --> 7907.20]  So $1,000 a month for the parent company and then like each YouTube channel for us, for example, would be $50?
[7907.78 --> 7907.98]  Yeah.
[7907.98 --> 7912.94]  I will not be paying that.
[7913.06 --> 7914.46]  Yeah, screw that noise.
[7914.46 --> 7921.46]  In a reply to William Shatner, Elon Musk said that the move to sunset Legacy Verification was about fairness.
[7921.46 --> 7932.68]  In unrelated news, Twitter's top 500 advertisers and its top 10,000 most followed accounts will be exempt from the $1,000 a month fee.
[7935.18 --> 7935.82]  Okay.
[7935.82 --> 7940.38]  Are we completely done now?
[7940.82 --> 7948.96]  Are we completely done pretending that any of this was about free speech, anything, or public square, anything?
[7949.12 --> 7949.54]  Are we done?
[7949.54 --> 7951.02]  What does this verification do?
[7951.54 --> 7953.14]  I mean, yeah.
[7953.76 --> 7954.08]  Okay.
[7954.08 --> 7957.18]  What does this verification do at this point?
[7957.56 --> 7958.10]  But more.
[7959.20 --> 7970.86]  On April 15th, Twitter's For You page will only contain tweets from accounts that the user follows directly and accounts that are subscribed to Twitter Blue.
[7971.48 --> 7971.80]  Okay.
[7972.68 --> 7973.44]  With the check mark.
[7973.96 --> 7978.92]  As promised by Musk, Twitter recently made a portion of its code public, including its recommendation algorithm.
[7978.92 --> 7985.74]  The For You page currently contains an average of a 50-50 mix of accounts that the user directly follows and those that they do not.
[7985.88 --> 7987.94]  So you may also like that sort of thing.
[7988.76 --> 7997.78]  It also contains a list of notable users called power users, as well as the option to increase the visibility of these users at will from the back end.
[7998.06 --> 8005.18]  The algorithm also notes whether a tweet was created by a power user and what their political affiliation is if they are a public figure.
[8005.52 --> 8006.78]  Or a political figure, excuse me.
[8006.78 --> 8011.64]  There is a separate flag for if the author of the tweet is Elon Musk.
[8011.80 --> 8012.06]  Okay.
[8012.12 --> 8015.38]  So as far as my understanding goes, they open sourced the Twitter algorithm.
[8015.68 --> 8020.16]  And I saw screenshots of this and I literally thought it was a joke.
[8023.00 --> 8023.40]  What?
[8023.92 --> 8024.32]  Okay.
[8024.40 --> 8024.62]  Yeah.
[8024.64 --> 8025.74]  So I saw this.
[8025.80 --> 8029.88]  It said Democrat, Republican, power user, and Elon Musk.
[8029.94 --> 8031.94]  Those were the four different like user flags.
[8032.48 --> 8034.74]  I 100% thought it was a joke.
[8035.28 --> 8035.72]  Really?
[8035.72 --> 8035.82]  Really?
[8036.36 --> 8043.18]  Musk states that he was not previously aware of the labels and that it doesn't make sense to divide users on the basis of political allegiance.
[8043.80 --> 8046.92]  A Twitter engineer has said that they were used purely for metrics.
[8047.74 --> 8056.54]  In a memo to employees, Musk claimed that Twitter is now worth $20 billion and that Twitter can be thought of as an inverse startup,
[8056.54 --> 8062.78]  but that he sees a clear but difficult path to a future valuation of more than $250 billion.
[8062.78 --> 8072.12]  Our discussion question is, is this a purposeful attempt to make the Twitter user experience more hostile?
[8072.12 --> 8073.12]  I can't.
[8073.12 --> 8075.26]  I can't.
[8077.26 --> 8077.76]  I can't.
[8077.76 --> 8078.84]  I can kind of see it.
[8079.94 --> 8081.02]  I can kind of see it.
[8081.02 --> 8084.48]  Because obviously he needs a way out of this thing.
[8084.94 --> 8085.80]  Like this is awful.
[8085.98 --> 8089.04]  And he needs to spend his time running SpaceX and Tesla.
[8089.42 --> 8091.76]  Is he still spending like all his time doing Twitter stuff?
[8091.98 --> 8092.22]  Whatever.
[8092.72 --> 8094.50]  It seems to be not zero.
[8095.08 --> 8099.56]  And the correct amount of time for Elon Musk to spend managing Twitter is zero.
[8099.56 --> 8104.72]  However, he has third party investors that helped him make this acquisition.
[8105.60 --> 8113.54]  If he doesn't at least in good faith over some period of time that we would have no way of knowing,
[8114.24 --> 8119.78]  make some kind of arguably earnest effort to turn this thing around,
[8120.64 --> 8128.14]  he's not only going to be on the hook for any kind of operating costs that he's on the hook for now,
[8128.14 --> 8130.76]  but he could be on the hook for paying back those investors.
[8130.88 --> 8133.22]  We have no idea what the terms of those deals were.
[8134.80 --> 8138.70]  So he must be, it seems, maybe.
[8138.88 --> 8144.14]  Again, though, maybe I'm attributing 4D chess moves to someone who...
[8147.44 --> 8148.14]  I mean...
[8149.10 --> 8150.32]  Why did you buy this thing?
[8150.46 --> 8150.64]  Yeah.
[8151.68 --> 8157.90]  So it could be that these legitimately are attempts to make the user experience more hostile
[8157.90 --> 8160.36]  and worse so that over time...
[8160.36 --> 8162.66]  Define hostile in this situation.
[8163.74 --> 8166.66]  How is it exactly making the user experience hostile?
[8167.82 --> 8170.94]  Well, it's hostile to anyone who's trying to grow on the platform.
[8171.12 --> 8172.02]  I would make that argument.
[8172.22 --> 8174.46]  If you can't get featured on the For You page,
[8174.96 --> 8179.00]  I think that it makes a clear divide between the haves and the have-nots.
[8179.42 --> 8179.54]  Yeah.
[8179.60 --> 8179.90]  So with this...
[8180.90 --> 8182.72]  I guess I have a lot of questions here.
[8182.72 --> 8185.18]  Like, would this still show...
[8185.94 --> 8186.76]  Like, if you...
[8186.76 --> 8187.48]  If...
[8187.48 --> 8187.78]  Okay.
[8187.90 --> 8188.70]  I won't put it on you.
[8188.94 --> 8189.74]  I'll put it on me.
[8190.20 --> 8190.86]  Say...
[8190.86 --> 8191.82]  This is never going to happen.
[8192.06 --> 8197.10]  Say I was a paid subscriber to Twitter, whatever paid verification thing.
[8197.12 --> 8197.58]  Yeah, Twitter blue.
[8197.60 --> 8199.64]  So my stuff can show up in the verified page.
[8199.76 --> 8199.94]  Yeah.
[8200.18 --> 8203.50]  If I like your tweet and you're not,
[8204.34 --> 8206.98]  would that interaction show up?
[8207.50 --> 8209.62]  No, because For You is tweets.
[8210.00 --> 8211.00]  Oh, it's just tweets.
[8211.02 --> 8212.56]  Yeah, not likes from people that you follow.
[8212.68 --> 8213.18]  Okay, yeah.
[8213.30 --> 8213.46]  Yeah.
[8213.68 --> 8214.84]  What page shows that?
[8215.64 --> 8218.12]  I think that's just the notification feed.
[8218.28 --> 8218.88]  I can't remember.
[8219.68 --> 8221.12]  I've hardly used it lately.
[8221.46 --> 8223.34]  I go on as little as possible.
[8223.62 --> 8224.54]  I do...
[8224.54 --> 8227.80]  There's a few people, like industry people, that I DM on Twitter.
[8227.80 --> 8229.28]  That's our main method of communication.
[8229.42 --> 8232.08]  So I open the app fairly often, but I try not to linger.
[8234.18 --> 8234.94]  Yeah, I don't know.
[8234.98 --> 8235.80]  This is weird.
[8235.80 --> 8236.40]  This is weird.
[8236.76 --> 8243.38]  He mentioned previously about like free speech absolutism for the town square,
[8243.54 --> 8245.00]  but no free...
[8245.00 --> 8245.92]  What did he call it?
[8246.60 --> 8247.80]  No free like...
[8248.82 --> 8249.18]  Lunch.
[8249.44 --> 8250.04]  No, I don't know.
[8251.62 --> 8255.14]  That we won't like broadcast your voice for free, basically.
[8255.36 --> 8256.86]  Yeah, so then it's not a town square.
[8256.86 --> 8258.70]  You can like whisper in the corner of the town square.
[8258.90 --> 8261.34]  Yeah, which is exactly what he claimed was a problem before.
[8262.30 --> 8263.80]  Suppression of particular...
[8263.80 --> 8264.32]  Yeah, anyway.
[8264.32 --> 8264.36]  Okay.
[8264.72 --> 8267.12]  This is never going to be worth $250 billion.
[8267.82 --> 8268.74]  Like how?
[8269.24 --> 8269.58]  How?
[8269.90 --> 8270.30]  That's...
[8270.30 --> 8275.46]  One of my arguments that I believe I've been rather consistent about with Twitter is just
[8275.46 --> 8277.48]  like, it's never going to make money.
[8277.62 --> 8279.18]  Well, I think he has to say this though.
[8279.28 --> 8280.28]  No, I hear you.
[8280.28 --> 8282.28]  If he doesn't say this, then...
[8283.40 --> 8285.72]  But just like, how do you fall for that?
[8286.26 --> 8290.80]  And like maybe in, let's say 10 years from now, someone brings this up and Twitter's worth
[8290.80 --> 8293.36]  a quarter billion dollars and I look like an idiot.
[8293.48 --> 8295.70]  But like, what are you talking about?
[8295.98 --> 8296.40]  How?
[8297.08 --> 8297.52]  How?
[8297.52 --> 8299.52]  What?
[8300.28 --> 8302.16]  I don't get it.
[8302.32 --> 8304.44]  You bought a garbage fire and it's still a garbage fire.
[8304.66 --> 8305.24]  I don't know.
[8306.30 --> 8308.76]  I mean, that's the thing about a garbage fire though.
[8308.98 --> 8310.82]  Is eventually either...
[8311.44 --> 8313.52]  Eventually all the garbage and all the fire are gone.
[8314.52 --> 8315.86]  It can't burn forever.
[8315.86 --> 8323.44]  I feel like all the people like just continuing to use it no matter what is adding the fuel.
[8324.62 --> 8328.02]  I'm quite surprised at the amount of people that are still on the platform.
[8329.42 --> 8332.42]  But I think for a lot of people, it's like basically irreplaceable.
[8332.80 --> 8334.00]  But they're not...
[8334.00 --> 8339.10]  It's irreplaceable, but they are 100% not willing to pay for it, which is a very interesting setup.
[8339.36 --> 8339.66]  Yeah.
[8341.00 --> 8345.12]  They will not stop using it, but they also will not pay for it.
[8345.12 --> 8345.40]  Yeah.
[8345.86 --> 8346.50]  It's the internet.
[8346.86 --> 8347.16]  Yeah.
[8347.46 --> 8347.78]  Yeah.
[8348.44 --> 8350.50]  It's true for almost everything.
[8351.00 --> 8351.18]  Yeah.
[8351.26 --> 8354.64]  Like we've talked a lot about the...
[8355.52 --> 8361.14]  Could there be a paradigm shift between an ad supported internet and a paid internet?
[8361.90 --> 8366.20]  And we've basically gone like, no, it'll never happen.
[8366.20 --> 8368.36]  Because people are...
[8368.36 --> 8374.72]  They don't want ads, but they accept them because they are utterly unwilling to pay for services.
[8374.72 --> 8376.46]  I have not experienced this.
[8376.46 --> 8377.00]  I don't know.
[8377.00 --> 8378.06]  We're speaking broadly, obviously.
[8378.06 --> 8378.50]  Yeah.
[8378.50 --> 8378.66]  Yeah.
[8378.66 --> 8379.10]  Yeah.
[8379.10 --> 8379.18]  Yeah.
[8379.18 --> 8383.92]  Of course, someone in chat is screaming because they're an example of the other side, but
[8383.92 --> 8385.42]  it's not most people.
[8386.02 --> 8390.22]  I have not personally experienced this, so I can't verify it's truth.
[8390.58 --> 8394.44]  And images mean literally nothing for verification these days.
[8394.44 --> 8400.90]  But someone showed me a screenshot of apparently Bing chat inserting an ad into a conversation
[8400.90 --> 8401.72]  that they had with it.
[8402.08 --> 8405.54]  They asked it about buying a certain product and they were like, what about this one?
[8405.68 --> 8407.04]  It has a good affiliate program.
[8407.24 --> 8407.46]  Yeah.
[8407.46 --> 8414.56]  This is exactly why I was saying I was very happy that the chat GPT thing, or I was hoping
[8414.56 --> 8419.24]  that they went in the direction of a subscription, and then I'm very happy that they did, is because
[8419.24 --> 8420.42]  yeah, everything...
[8420.42 --> 8424.72]  You have to find other indirect ways of monetization because no one's going to pay for stuff.
[8428.60 --> 8429.04]  Crazy.
[8429.78 --> 8433.38]  Well, I hated Twitter before and it sounds like it's going to be even less useful.
[8434.32 --> 8434.62]  Yeah.
[8434.62 --> 8440.06]  Okay, I think in my opinion, the biggest thing that gets hurt here is another point that he
[8440.06 --> 8447.92]  used to make, which was about the proliferation of news from individuals.
[8448.88 --> 8453.44]  Because an individual will witness something and then they are the first point of truth for
[8453.44 --> 8455.00]  this news thing that's going on.
[8456.28 --> 8458.38]  That's now going to go nowhere.
[8458.58 --> 8459.88]  Unless they subscribe to Twitter Blue.
[8460.02 --> 8460.28]  Yeah.
[8461.06 --> 8461.80]  In the town square.
[8461.80 --> 8466.34]  Which, I mean, it almost doesn't matter how much it costs.
[8466.60 --> 8468.70]  It's in USD, I'm assuming.
[8468.98 --> 8472.54]  So there's going to be places in the world where it's just not feasible to purchase for
[8472.54 --> 8473.62]  a huge percentage of people.
[8473.72 --> 8474.22]  I have no idea.
[8474.32 --> 8475.52]  They may have regional pricing.
[8475.70 --> 8476.26]  I just...
[8476.26 --> 8478.00]  I sort of don't care at this point.
[8478.08 --> 8479.20]  This is not going to work.
[8479.32 --> 8481.42]  This is going to disappear.
[8481.76 --> 8484.16]  It's also not going to make them $250 billion.
[8484.58 --> 8486.24]  I said a quarter billion dollars before.
[8486.54 --> 8487.62]  Quarter trillion dollars.
[8487.78 --> 8487.96]  Sorry.
[8487.96 --> 8488.20]  Yeah.
[8488.34 --> 8492.18]  $250 billion is super de-duper not happening.
[8495.22 --> 8496.36]  Oh, boy.
[8497.46 --> 8498.60]  Well, that's cool.
[8499.58 --> 8503.44]  E3 is cancelled for 2023 and perhaps forever.
[8504.18 --> 8505.98]  E3 has been cancelled again this year.
[8506.16 --> 8510.86]  It hasn't been held since 2021 and its organizers refuse to answer whether it will return in
[8510.86 --> 8511.96]  2024 either.
[8511.96 --> 8516.24]  Even prior to the pandemic, many large gaming companies were holding their own separate
[8516.24 --> 8523.14]  events before or after E3, starting with Nintendo in 2011, leading to a slow drain on E3's
[8523.14 --> 8524.12]  industry cachet.
[8524.52 --> 8527.74]  The benefit of these separate events was that they allowed companies in the exclusive stage
[8527.74 --> 8532.92]  to present carefully choreographed content rather than sharing the spotlight and potentially
[8532.92 --> 8534.88]  embarrassing themselves with an unscripted moment.
[8535.34 --> 8538.92]  It likewise allowed many professionals in the industry to meet face-to-face and for reviewers
[8538.92 --> 8541.20]  to get an early hands-on preview with new hardware.
[8541.20 --> 8547.76]  Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft had all officially declined attendance at the 2023 E3 well before
[8547.76 --> 8548.32]  the cancellation.
[8549.10 --> 8555.30]  Last month, Ubisoft promised to attend E3 if it happened before cancelling earlier this
[8555.30 --> 8555.74]  week.
[8556.50 --> 8557.28]  Discussion question.
[8557.78 --> 8562.04]  How much of a loss is this and what, if anything, will replace E3?
[8562.54 --> 8563.28]  Have you been?
[8563.74 --> 8564.94]  I never went.
[8565.38 --> 8568.62]  We as a company attended once, but I believe that was you.
[8568.88 --> 8569.08]  Yeah.
[8569.08 --> 8570.60]  Was it once or was it more than once?
[8570.60 --> 8574.64]  It was one time and I was asked if we should go again and I said no.
[8578.00 --> 8578.44]  Oof.
[8578.64 --> 8582.58]  This might be throwing some fire, but what a like useless show.
[8583.58 --> 8584.98]  I don't want to be that guy.
[8585.18 --> 8585.88]  I'm sorry.
[8586.28 --> 8589.34]  But attending that show, I love this type of stuff.
[8589.82 --> 8591.84]  It's like literally one of my favorite things to do is go to shows.
[8591.84 --> 8596.36]  We were not known in the gaming space at that time.
[8596.76 --> 8604.54]  So we got to do nothing because all of the cool stuff is like behind doors or it's in
[8604.54 --> 8610.26]  a gigantic conference room with tons of cameras anyways, because it's like Xbox announcing something,
[8610.40 --> 8612.76]  which people are just going to watch the stream.
[8612.76 --> 8622.04]  Anyways, I love these types of shows, but functionally, there's a reason why these companies are stepping out.
[8622.18 --> 8623.44]  Exactly like what you just said.
[8623.76 --> 8628.02]  Nintendo directs get huge attendance and coverage.
[8628.44 --> 8628.46]  Yeah.
[8628.50 --> 8630.62]  People watch those religiously.
[8630.68 --> 8632.36]  Like they're crazy about them.
[8632.36 --> 8638.28]  The amount of people that are going to be able to walk through the Nintendo booth at E3 is not that high.
[8638.28 --> 8645.26]  And if Nintendo has something like really crazy to show off, that's like borderline unannounced.
[8645.34 --> 8648.16]  And like they have one prototype, they're not going to put it on the floor.
[8648.44 --> 8650.30]  They're going to put it behind closed doors anyways.
[8650.62 --> 8650.74]  Yeah.
[8650.80 --> 8658.28]  So it's just like the future of these types of events are the games, comms and PAXs of the world because they're community events.
[8658.40 --> 8658.84]  Yeah.
[8658.84 --> 8663.22]  But the industry events here, I don't, I'm not surprised E3 didn't happen.
[8663.32 --> 8665.58]  I will be extremely unsurprised if it happens again.
[8665.70 --> 8669.36]  And I'm sure I just pissed a bunch of people off by saying the stuff I just said.
[8669.46 --> 8675.88]  But like back when we went to it, I was already thinking like, wow, I'm stunned this exists.
[8675.88 --> 8679.76]  You see it happening to CES even.
[8680.60 --> 8684.48]  And CES is more physical stuff than E3.
[8684.48 --> 8685.10]  CES is more physical stuff than E3.
[8685.10 --> 8690.66]  And people are still doing their own events or just not going and doing like web announcements of their own things.
[8690.74 --> 8694.76]  I've got some people talking about how it was good for developers, but yeah, pretty weak for users.
[8695.02 --> 8700.12]  Yeah, but that's, that's not, then it's a different show at that point.
[8700.22 --> 8701.08]  Yeah, that's fair.
[8701.26 --> 8703.36]  Make it like E3 dev or something.
[8703.42 --> 8703.62]  Sure.
[8703.62 --> 8711.54]  Like PAX has a, I don't remember exactly what it's called, but PAX has like a mini developer conference that usually happens before the main show of PAX starts.
[8711.74 --> 8713.02]  And that can make sense.
[8713.14 --> 8718.58]  But it's this like E3 is set up as this huge public announcement stage basically.
[8719.06 --> 8721.36]  And it's, it's not that good at that anymore.
[8722.30 --> 8727.00]  So, but yeah, it could, it could absolutely be this like developer event.
[8727.42 --> 8728.48]  Tons of those exist.
[8729.32 --> 8731.86]  Yes, of course it could do that, but it's not set up that way.
[8731.86 --> 8737.26]  I think it is very TV era and we're, we're pretty out of that now.
[8737.54 --> 8739.40]  So yeah, I'm not surprised.
[8741.36 --> 8744.02]  We should probably do some merch messages actually.
[8744.34 --> 8748.84]  Oh yeah, no, we've still got, I don't know, we've still got a couple topics.
[8749.20 --> 8749.76]  Dolphin emulator.
[8750.00 --> 8751.64]  Oh wait, we've got, holy crap.
[8751.78 --> 8753.38]  I knew I need to do this first.
[8755.80 --> 8757.06]  My light switches.
[8757.48 --> 8758.22]  Oh boy.
[8758.50 --> 8759.84]  Have been a problem for me.
[8759.98 --> 8760.22]  Yeah.
[8760.22 --> 8768.38]  Um, even though I, I was clearly desperately seeking a solution to my wifi troubles a little
[8768.38 --> 8774.26]  while ago when I misdiagnosed that, um, you know, they're not actually causing interference,
[8774.26 --> 8775.80]  at least on my local network.
[8776.26 --> 8777.86]  They don't work very well.
[8778.02 --> 8782.36]  I went through and I was trying to add some more to my controller and they're doing this
[8782.36 --> 8787.70]  weird thing where they, two on the network will end up with the same ID and then one will
[8787.70 --> 8790.14]  wipe out the other one and then I don't know which one it wiped out.
[8790.14 --> 8796.50]  And then I have to go, uh, exclude both of them and then try re-including them and maybe
[8796.50 --> 8798.66]  they'll grab a unique ID or maybe they won't.
[8798.70 --> 8801.56]  They're just, they're not working very well.
[8801.84 --> 8807.84]  To Jasko's credit, they did, um, make their firmware available, but I'm still not happy with
[8807.84 --> 8810.30]  the product and the overall experience.
[8811.66 --> 8819.72]  So, um, a more sort of community oriented company in a valley who we were very close to using a
[8819.72 --> 8824.66]  product from when we were originally setting up the place, but ultimately didn't because they
[8824.66 --> 8827.50]  didn't have a switch with motion or presence detect.
[8827.50 --> 8834.08]  We wanted to use motion as part of a presence detection system and they didn't have anything
[8834.08 --> 8838.42]  that did motion detection or presence detection integrated into the switch.
[8838.78 --> 8840.00]  Well, guess what?
[8840.96 --> 8844.12]  Um, let me just go ahead and click on this.
[8845.72 --> 8846.32]  Okay.
[8846.32 --> 8846.48]  Okay.
[8846.84 --> 8854.80]  It is not currently live because I told them we were going to, we were going to go for it
[8854.80 --> 8856.38]  live on the show.
[8856.96 --> 8862.42]  And, uh, I think they were hoping to kind of punch it at the same time.
[8862.42 --> 8864.50]  So I'll give them, I'll give them another few minutes.
[8864.50 --> 8868.96]  I feel terrible that we took this long to, uh, to get to this cause maybe they've like
[8868.96 --> 8869.68]  gone to bed.
[8869.68 --> 8871.34]  I don't know what time zone they're even in.
[8871.44 --> 8872.58]  I feel, I feel terrible.
[8872.84 --> 8874.34]  The second link does load a page.
[8874.64 --> 8874.88]  Yeah.
[8874.88 --> 8875.96]  So I'll bring that up in a second.
[8875.96 --> 8882.06]  Anyway, uh, Eric and his team at Inovelli saw our struggle and decided to do something
[8882.06 --> 8884.62]  about it by bringing the smart back into smart home.
[8884.72 --> 8888.88]  This is, this is from, from them, I think by creating the ultimate smart switch, one
[8888.88 --> 8893.56]  that uses millimeter wave technology as a form of radar to sense the presence of a person
[8893.56 --> 8895.02]  in the room, not just movement.
[8895.18 --> 8898.28]  So you don't have to keep like waving your hand every few minutes to keep yourself from
[8898.28 --> 8899.40]  sitting in the dark.
[8900.12 --> 8905.44]  Um, today they are launching a crowdfunding campaign for what they are calling internally
[8905.44 --> 8905.94]  Inovelli.
[8905.94 --> 8910.78]  And this was actually a source of tension between me and Inovelli because they called
[8910.78 --> 8914.34]  it project Linus without talking to me about it.
[8914.34 --> 8916.92]  And I was like, Hey, that's actually not that cool.
[8916.92 --> 8919.52]  Cause it really sounds like we're affiliated in some way.
[8919.60 --> 8922.54]  We're still not affiliated, not an investor in Inovelli.
[8922.54 --> 8924.26]  I have no skin in the game other than that.
[8924.32 --> 8926.50]  I just want a good switch.
[8926.84 --> 8930.18]  Um, and they are still calling it project Linus internally, apparently.
[8930.48 --> 8932.70]  Um, so they're launching a crowdfunding campaign.
[8932.70 --> 8938.24]  They are hoping, expecting to be able to meet their goal, a minimum of 125,000 to cover the
[8938.24 --> 8940.70]  engineering fees and the minimum order order quantity.
[8940.70 --> 8947.46]  But if not, they will be refunding all backers and they are planning to launch, I think during
[8947.46 --> 8948.22]  the show today.
[8948.34 --> 8950.46]  Let me see if it's actually, it is live.
[8951.26 --> 8951.70]  All right.
[8951.86 --> 8953.52]  So I'm going to post this in the chat.
[8953.86 --> 8955.82]  Really excited about this switch.
[8956.56 --> 8960.98]  It's, um, I've kind of, I've kind of told them all the pain points that I have with my
[8960.98 --> 8968.24]  existing Jasko switches, uh, flickering, um, not really very broad control of dimming across
[8968.24 --> 8974.38]  a variety of different lights, um, adoption problems, uh, configuration limitations.
[8974.98 --> 8979.52]  Uh, the fact that they're just motion, like the, the original plan was to use a combination
[8979.52 --> 8981.66]  of motion and other factors.
[8981.66 --> 8984.86]  And we just, because we, the switches don't work at all.
[8984.86 --> 8989.12]  We haven't gotten around to integrating motion with the cameras or integrating motion with,
[8989.12 --> 8993.38]  um, some kind of IR presence detector or anything like that.
[8993.38 --> 9002.34]  Uh, but this looks like assuming they get everything nailed down the solution to my problem, I hope.
[9002.38 --> 9004.06]  And they've got a pretty good track record.
[9004.14 --> 9007.58]  We don't promote Kickstarters or Indiegogos.
[9007.70 --> 9010.28]  We didn't take any advertising fees or anything like that.
[9010.72 --> 9012.78]  Um, so no money has changed hands.
[9012.94 --> 9016.22]  I just really want this switch to exist.
[9016.22 --> 9018.54]  I really want this switch to exist.
[9019.54 --> 9022.24]  Um, I just noticed it doesn't need a neutral wire.
[9023.38 --> 9025.56]  Um, that's, that's pretty amazing.
[9025.88 --> 9027.10]  That means I could use them in my house.
[9027.16 --> 9027.88]  I don't have neutral wires.
[9027.92 --> 9028.20]  Oh yeah.
[9028.28 --> 9032.76]  Another thing that drives me crazy about my existing ones is that they have like a main
[9032.76 --> 9034.34]  switch with the motion sensor.
[9034.58 --> 9038.14]  And then they have a secondary switch that doesn't have a motion sensor.
[9038.24 --> 9039.34]  It's just a regular rocker.
[9039.44 --> 9044.90]  So in a large room, like in the rec room, there's parts where there is a motion sensor and there's
[9044.90 --> 9046.06]  parts where there isn't one.
[9046.52 --> 9050.44]  So my understanding is these shouldn't need that relationship.
[9050.44 --> 9053.74]  I could have the millimeter wave sensor in both locations.
[9053.82 --> 9056.18]  So it doesn't matter what part of the room you're hanging out in.
[9056.52 --> 9062.30]  Uh, it's particularly problematic on stairs because where you have a three-way switch on
[9062.30 --> 9065.72]  a staircase, it only automatically activates on one end.
[9065.90 --> 9066.34]  Yeah.
[9066.62 --> 9067.82]  It's just like, okay.
[9068.66 --> 9070.06]  Um, guess I don't need to see.
[9070.34 --> 9070.66]  Yeah.
[9070.66 --> 9073.14]  I guess when I'm going down, it's like, whatever.
[9073.54 --> 9077.46]  Um, automated led bar notifications.
[9078.46 --> 9081.16]  Um, I've been looking at that led bar thing.
[9081.26 --> 9081.96]  That's cool.
[9082.64 --> 9084.02]  Upgradable to matter.
[9085.42 --> 9087.28]  Pretty excite.
[9088.02 --> 9092.30]  Uh, they're working with home assistant to make sure that it integrates with home assistant.
[9093.04 --> 9094.68]  Ooh, smart bulb control.
[9094.68 --> 9096.46]  All right.
[9096.60 --> 9096.92]  So.
[9097.92 --> 9101.10]  So if this makes it, are you, are you doing a full rack of these?
[9101.76 --> 9102.14]  Yeah.
[9103.20 --> 9103.96]  I hope so.
[9104.32 --> 9109.52]  I mean, it has to not be crap, but like I said, they have a pretty good track record so
[9109.52 --> 9109.80]  far.
[9110.40 --> 9111.60]  So I'm pretty excited.
[9112.56 --> 9114.04]  I hope, hoping for the best.
[9114.26 --> 9114.58]  All right.
[9114.62 --> 9117.12]  Well, they've got their 1% of the weight of their goal so far.
[9117.36 --> 9119.40]  The page is having a hard time loading now.
[9119.74 --> 9120.44]  Oh, sorry.
[9120.64 --> 9123.58]  I guess we, well, you'd think Indiegogo would hold it together.
[9123.58 --> 9124.02]  Yeah.
[9124.02 --> 9124.82]  What's up with that?
[9124.92 --> 9125.52]  I don't really know.
[9125.64 --> 9126.70]  It could just be this laptop.
[9126.80 --> 9128.68]  This laptop sometimes does have problems.
[9129.32 --> 9129.50]  Nope.
[9129.62 --> 9130.54]  It's, uh, it's me too.
[9130.74 --> 9131.30]  It's you too.
[9131.54 --> 9131.70]  Yeah.
[9131.76 --> 9132.36]  You hugged it.
[9132.76 --> 9133.16]  Okay.
[9133.30 --> 9139.26]  Well, I didn't think you'd, you'd hug Indiegogo, but maybe, uh, Kickstarter style stuff is not
[9139.26 --> 9140.34]  as in vogue these days.
[9140.68 --> 9141.10]  Yeah.
[9141.16 --> 9143.28]  Maybe the, the server hamsters are tired.
[9143.54 --> 9143.84]  Yeah.
[9144.38 --> 9144.82]  Um.
[9146.74 --> 9148.02]  Got some backers going already.
[9148.20 --> 9148.64]  Okay.
[9148.64 --> 9153.32]  Uh, I think we have one more small topic and then we're on to.
[9153.52 --> 9155.08]  Let's do some merch messages first.
[9155.30 --> 9155.52]  Okay.
[9155.84 --> 9156.14]  Yeah.
[9158.28 --> 9159.08]  All right.
[9159.10 --> 9160.42]  Let's get set up here.
[9160.90 --> 9161.36]  Yeah.
[9161.36 --> 9162.46]  We've got a, we've got a few today.
[9162.68 --> 9163.02]  Um.
[9163.14 --> 9163.88]  Actually, hold on.
[9163.94 --> 9165.32]  First of all, Nick messaged me.
[9165.50 --> 9173.32]  I think, I, I think his intention is to, or his, his leaning is for us to do affiliate
[9173.32 --> 9173.98]  stuff.
[9174.88 --> 9181.12]  Um, by extension of this argument, we should not accept sponsorships from any brand that
[9181.12 --> 9183.80]  works with any influencer that might not disclose their sponsorship.
[9184.38 --> 9187.26]  That could basically remove all brands.
[9187.94 --> 9192.30]  Um, all we can really do is be the change we want to see in the world.
[9192.30 --> 9194.22]  And if we say, look, you have to disclose.
[9194.22 --> 9195.52]  I said you don't have to.
[9195.96 --> 9196.34]  Okay.
[9196.82 --> 9201.82]  Well, look, I mean, people are like super mad and I'm like, I don't think that's a good
[9201.82 --> 9203.06]  stance either.
[9203.32 --> 9204.02]  And yeah.
[9204.84 --> 9205.24]  Yeah.
[9208.62 --> 9209.02]  Okay.
[9209.08 --> 9209.64]  You want some merchandise?
[9209.84 --> 9209.94]  Yeah.
[9210.54 --> 9210.98]  Yeah.
[9210.98 --> 9212.02]  I do want merch messages.
[9212.22 --> 9212.70]  All right.
[9212.96 --> 9218.32]  I think, I think the thing that was maybe lost is that my argument was that you should
[9218.32 --> 9218.66]  try.
[9219.82 --> 9220.22]  Sure.
[9220.90 --> 9224.66]  Oh, I think the thing that you may be lost when I was trying to explain that the reason
[9224.66 --> 9228.88]  we were talking to people in, no, no, no, no, no, when we were, when we were talking
[9228.88 --> 9233.22]  to people individually, the reason we were doing that was because we did try.
[9233.74 --> 9233.98]  Okay.
[9233.98 --> 9235.14]  That was my, that was my point.
[9235.18 --> 9237.26]  I was like, well, okay.
[9238.18 --> 9241.04]  Um, yeah, we did try.
[9241.18 --> 9242.26]  They don't do that.
[9242.26 --> 9246.14]  I got a lot of pushback on asking if they had some type of integrity checks or anything.
[9246.14 --> 9251.10]  Oh, I think both you and I are going to go back and watch that segment and be like,
[9251.10 --> 9252.28]  this happens.
[9252.50 --> 9253.24]  This happens.
[9253.46 --> 9253.70]  Yeah.
[9253.70 --> 9258.26]  Because I thought this is why I was telling them that I don't want people necessarily
[9258.26 --> 9259.06]  on my side.
[9259.12 --> 9259.42]  Okay.
[9259.42 --> 9263.28]  It's like, I think there's more nuance to the entire discussion and we just got wrapped
[9263.28 --> 9264.20]  up in like whatever.
[9264.56 --> 9266.70]  And it's like, actually probably not a big deal.
[9266.84 --> 9268.30]  That's why I also wanted to move on.
[9268.30 --> 9272.38]  I thought I made that clear, but I thinking back, I probably didn't.
[9272.48 --> 9273.50]  I also might've just missed it.
[9273.62 --> 9273.98]  I don't know.
[9274.10 --> 9274.38]  Yeah.
[9274.60 --> 9275.24]  Well, whatever.
[9275.58 --> 9277.44]  I it's, it's really not that deep.
[9277.44 --> 9281.16]  And like, you guys should really not be like that worried about it.
[9281.16 --> 9287.82]  I think one of my favorite things about LTT store is the level of integrity that the store
[9287.82 --> 9288.20]  has.
[9288.82 --> 9293.78]  And I have always enjoyed how we do stuff as a company.
[9293.98 --> 9295.74]  It's not going to change because of this thing.
[9295.86 --> 9299.50]  And all I want to make sure is that we're doing due diligence as much as we could.
[9299.70 --> 9302.14]  And if we're like, we're pretty sure these guys are cool.
[9302.36 --> 9304.24]  That's often as far as you can go.
[9305.76 --> 9310.76]  It sounded like you had a very unrealistic expectation for what I could do, which is why
[9310.76 --> 9312.64]  I sort of took it too far.
[9312.74 --> 9317.26]  And I kind of went, well, what should we, should we check every site on the internet to see
[9317.26 --> 9318.52]  how people are using the link?
[9318.52 --> 9320.34]  Like, cause obviously you can't do that.
[9320.98 --> 9324.94]  But like, I also strongly enjoy, we're coming back.
[9325.02 --> 9326.04]  We're making it happen.
[9327.16 --> 9332.74]  That's why I enjoy like when we dropped like anchor, for example, if we do detect, that's
[9332.74 --> 9338.32]  also when I was trying to talk about like, well, of course, if we do detect stuff, we have
[9338.32 --> 9344.26]  a very extensive track record running the entire length of the company of being willing to
[9344.26 --> 9345.00]  drop.
[9345.56 --> 9348.74]  And then maybe if they shift things and they change, whatever.
[9349.20 --> 9350.66]  That was intentional, wasn't it?
[9351.24 --> 9351.52]  What?
[9352.78 --> 9353.14]  Drop?
[9353.44 --> 9353.80]  Yeah.
[9353.88 --> 9355.86]  Our extensive track record of dropping things.
[9355.98 --> 9358.04]  Oh, it actually wasn't, but I enjoy that.
[9358.26 --> 9360.10]  That should have been, I should have just claimed it.
[9361.14 --> 9363.00]  But no, I wasn't trying to dig you.
[9363.00 --> 9367.30]  Uh, and then maybe being willing to work with them again if they, if they change or improve
[9367.30 --> 9367.62]  or whatever.
[9367.62 --> 9375.04]  But like, I, yeah, I don't like the idea that we just like, oh, this is just a weird space
[9375.04 --> 9375.94]  to shotgun everything.
[9376.46 --> 9377.42]  Well, we're not going to do that.
[9377.68 --> 9383.86]  I will say a hundred percent that we will require all the legal disclosures that we require of
[9383.86 --> 9385.24]  ourselves when working with partners.
[9385.34 --> 9389.54]  All I'm saying is we should do everything we can to try to ensure that if we're working
[9389.54 --> 9391.38]  with aggregates, they're the best ones we can.
[9391.38 --> 9392.06]  Okay.
[9392.20 --> 9395.52]  If we're working with whatever sites, they're the best ones we can.
[9395.98 --> 9396.34]  Sure.
[9396.40 --> 9397.94]  And we're transparent about what we're doing.
[9398.24 --> 9403.24]  And then I think we're in the clear, but like it has to, and this, I probably did bad
[9403.24 --> 9403.92]  job of communicating that.
[9403.96 --> 9404.22]  I don't know.
[9404.24 --> 9405.04]  I don't know what's going on, whatever.
[9405.28 --> 9409.60]  But like, if we're transparent about what we're doing, then the audience can also be
[9409.60 --> 9410.96]  somewhat of a watchdog for us.
[9411.12 --> 9416.16]  It sounded like what you were saying was we should just, if the space is ugly, then we
[9416.16 --> 9417.52]  should not participate at all.
[9417.58 --> 9418.78]  We should just leave status quo.
[9418.92 --> 9420.76]  Maybe, but it depends how ugly it is.
[9420.76 --> 9423.44]  And I was sitting there going, well, the status quo isn't good.
[9423.92 --> 9427.98]  If we come in and we say, okay, well, anytime you engage with us, you need proper disclosures.
[9428.60 --> 9428.94]  Net net.
[9429.02 --> 9429.94]  We are a positive space.
[9430.04 --> 9431.14]  We are a positive influence.
[9431.68 --> 9436.52]  I think, I still think it like, like it depends on how muddy the space is.
[9436.58 --> 9437.34]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[9437.34 --> 9442.10]  We're not going to pay anyone a flat fee without disclosure.
[9442.82 --> 9447.28]  And our affiliate program, I think really the safest thing would be for it to be open,
[9447.44 --> 9449.86]  for it to be a hammer.
[9450.36 --> 9450.72]  Yeah.
[9450.72 --> 9450.80]  Yeah.
[9450.94 --> 9458.10]  And honestly, in, I do agree with that because like, at a certain point, like you were trying,
[9458.24 --> 9460.72]  the argument you're trying to make about the, I don't remember what it was.
[9461.28 --> 9464.12]  We, we can't sell hammers because people might use them to hit people or whatever.
[9464.34 --> 9464.56]  Yeah.
[9464.66 --> 9466.02]  We got really off the rails.
[9466.02 --> 9467.42]  We did get pretty off the rails.
[9469.00 --> 9471.26]  At a certain point, you can't control everything.
[9471.58 --> 9477.30]  But if you're doing that open affiliate thingamajig, if there's maybe some way, I don't know.
[9477.50 --> 9483.04]  If you detect someone using it in a stupid way, you can try to get them to stop.
[9483.58 --> 9486.08]  But like, it just is what it is.
[9486.28 --> 9488.74]  Hopefully buddy on float plane is ready for us to come after them.
[9488.82 --> 9491.62]  Was that a float plane chat where they were saying, yeah, I run a bunch of those sites and
[9491.62 --> 9492.48]  they're super effective.
[9492.68 --> 9492.98]  Yeah.
[9493.30 --> 9493.58]  Yeah.
[9493.68 --> 9494.52]  We're coming for you.
[9494.70 --> 9494.84]  Yeah.
[9495.18 --> 9496.00]  We're coming for you.
[9496.08 --> 9496.26]  Yeah.
[9496.36 --> 9496.90]  I don't know.
[9496.98 --> 9500.16]  It's, it's really not, it's really not that deep.
[9500.34 --> 9503.02]  I don't think audience people should be that concerned about it.
[9503.26 --> 9504.16]  It's very normal.
[9504.34 --> 9505.74]  I just don't, I'm not.
[9506.24 --> 9508.92]  I think you and I both don't really like marketing.
[9509.18 --> 9509.50]  Yes.
[9512.74 --> 9516.08]  So there's a lot of concerns, but there's a lot of concerns with everything.
[9516.08 --> 9520.34]  And you have to, I was talking to a YouTube creator about this recently.
[9520.56 --> 9522.04]  You have to make the bag.
[9523.06 --> 9523.76]  You have to.
[9523.76 --> 9527.00]  And like, as much as that's like, when I was growing up, I was very.
[9527.24 --> 9529.52]  He means make the backpack, not like get that bag.
[9530.38 --> 9531.80]  No, I mean, get that bag.
[9531.88 --> 9532.04]  Oh.
[9532.18 --> 9533.10]  You have to make money.
[9533.62 --> 9534.82]  Oh, oh, okay.
[9534.82 --> 9535.52]  Well, okay.
[9535.90 --> 9537.48]  Like get that bag has sort of.
[9537.54 --> 9537.82]  Does it?
[9537.82 --> 9542.52]  A semi-negative connotation of like, YOLO, take the, get the bag.
[9542.52 --> 9542.84]  Oh, okay.
[9542.84 --> 9543.10]  Like.
[9543.10 --> 9545.72]  I, I, I'm not, I'm not one of the cool kids.
[9546.10 --> 9548.90]  Um, you have to make money and.
[9550.96 --> 9556.04]  You should try to do it with integrity, of course, but you do have to make money and going
[9556.04 --> 9556.78]  with the stance.
[9556.78 --> 9560.00]  Like when we first started working together.
[9560.12 --> 9560.32]  Yeah.
[9560.32 --> 9563.72]  I was very against like any advertisements ever and stuff.
[9563.78 --> 9564.00]  I was like.
[9564.50 --> 9565.44]  Check out our forum.
[9565.70 --> 9565.98]  Yeah.
[9566.38 --> 9566.52]  Yeah.
[9566.76 --> 9568.14]  Which doesn't make money by the way.
[9568.18 --> 9571.28]  And I still believe in that stuff to a certain degree.
[9571.28 --> 9577.62]  At this point we can, and back then it hurt us a little bit, but I appreciated your approach
[9577.62 --> 9580.44]  on it because we only worked with people that we thought we could verify.
[9581.12 --> 9584.72]  And then we got to a certain size where it's like, we have some weight to throw around.
[9584.88 --> 9587.66]  So we can increase the amount of companies that we can work with.
[9587.94 --> 9592.28]  But then if they start doing things in bad ways, we can drop them and we have a diverse
[9592.28 --> 9595.04]  income portfolio and we'll be okay.
[9595.30 --> 9595.54]  Yep.
[9595.72 --> 9596.96]  And we can keep moving forward.
[9596.96 --> 9599.64]  We can lose any one partner, probably any 10.
[9599.64 --> 9604.30]  And that's the other thing I said, you should diversify your stuff a bunch, but you should
[9604.30 --> 9609.88]  try to make money because especially as a creator, you're going to have lows and you're
[9609.88 --> 9612.74]  going to have highs, but you're going to have lows and you need to survive through that low
[9612.74 --> 9614.18]  until it comes back.
[9614.30 --> 9614.98]  We've had lows.
[9615.34 --> 9615.64]  Yeah.
[9616.08 --> 9617.58]  So like you have to make money.
[9617.64 --> 9621.02]  You have to do these marketing things, even if they're uncomfortable or weird or whatever,
[9621.02 --> 9622.52]  you have to do some amount of it.
[9622.52 --> 9623.32]  Yes and no.
[9623.32 --> 9627.30]  Cause like, that's another thing too, is I haven't even talked about some of the conversations
[9627.30 --> 9630.96]  we've had around like, um, uh, forget.
[9630.96 --> 9632.72]  So there's different kinds of marketing.
[9632.72 --> 9634.22]  I'm only like just learning about it.
[9634.22 --> 9636.54]  Cause I kind of, I kind of hate it.
[9636.54 --> 9643.04]  Like, uh, we, it's funny because I've made a career out of like companies spending their
[9643.04 --> 9644.52]  marketing budgets on me.
[9644.84 --> 9647.84]  And you technically used to do some amount of marketing.
[9647.96 --> 9649.34]  Cause I wasn't very good at it.
[9649.52 --> 9649.80]  Right.
[9649.80 --> 9654.14]  I was more of a product manager than I wasn't in the marketing department.
[9654.34 --> 9654.56]  Right.
[9654.64 --> 9660.08]  I was, I was sales and I've always believed the best way to sell is to educate because
[9660.08 --> 9664.62]  that way the customer who is uneducated will buy one thing.
[9664.62 --> 9668.48]  The customer who is educated will buy more because they will trust you.
[9668.48 --> 9670.74]  And so it's, it's mutually beneficial.
[9670.90 --> 9675.58]  We both win when we create a more educated, uh, buying environment.
[9675.58 --> 9679.68]  It has always been my philosophy and marketing is kind of like the opposite.
[9679.68 --> 9683.12]  of that marketing is truth be damned.
[9683.62 --> 9688.80]  Uh, we need people to buy our it's always the way I've kind of felt about it.
[9689.04 --> 9691.22]  And so I'm just kind of learning about it now.
[9691.22 --> 9696.32]  And it's, there's like these different like branches of, of, of marketing, like outreach
[9696.32 --> 9700.22]  marketing and retention marketing and this kind of marketing and that kind of marketing.
[9700.22 --> 9707.50]  Like, yeah, I, I can see now there's going to be a lot of internal debate about what we
[9707.50 --> 9713.22]  use and how we use it because the argument is always going to be it's effective.
[9714.02 --> 9714.42]  Yeah.
[9714.58 --> 9719.00]  And the counterpoint, like you said, I mean, I don't mind you pushing back on it.
[9719.30 --> 9723.76]  We have to be realistic, but we also have to have these conversations because the counterpoint
[9723.76 --> 9728.64]  is always going to be, you know, but what about how do we, how do we differentiate?
[9728.64 --> 9731.50]  We can't just look at what everyone else is doing and what's working.
[9731.74 --> 9734.04]  We have to also think about who we are.
[9734.58 --> 9737.14]  Um, and like, we'll be okay if we don't.
[9738.26 --> 9739.02]  No, we'll survive.
[9739.30 --> 9739.70]  So.
[9740.02 --> 9740.22]  Sure.
[9740.48 --> 9742.38]  But you can't take that approach with everything.
[9742.38 --> 9745.48]  Cause like I was just saying about what I was talking to that other creator about,
[9745.52 --> 9750.56]  like you have to, you have to make money or else you're just going to have to quit.
[9750.76 --> 9751.16]  Yeah.
[9751.16 --> 9753.42]  Or else you're not going to be making any difference to anything.
[9753.52 --> 9753.76]  Yeah.
[9753.76 --> 9760.42]  So like shades of gray, baby, there was, there was a conversation that we had years ago,
[9760.42 --> 9765.26]  um, where I was, I was impressed with something that someone did.
[9766.54 --> 9772.76]  And I said that I was, I was more impressed because they found a way to do this thing that
[9772.76 --> 9775.12]  I agreed with in a way that was profitable.
[9775.70 --> 9776.14]  Right.
[9776.32 --> 9781.56]  And people were unhappy that I pointed that out, but I'm still standing by that.
[9781.62 --> 9782.04]  Well, yeah.
[9782.04 --> 9785.84]  Because they are now able to still do that thing to this day.
[9786.16 --> 9786.50]  And eat.
[9787.42 --> 9792.44]  And employ other people and push it to a degree that there is no possible way they would have
[9792.44 --> 9794.32]  been able to get to if they didn't monetize it.
[9795.18 --> 9799.02]  And like, this is a, always find a way I will do it.
[9799.40 --> 9802.08]  Um, this is another argument that OpenAI made recently.
[9802.48 --> 9803.00]  Got him.
[9803.28 --> 9803.68]  Boom.
[9803.84 --> 9804.82]  Brought it all the way around.
[9805.24 --> 9810.42]  Um, where, and I don't know if this is legit and whatever, but they were talking about how
[9810.42 --> 9814.60]  they would never have been able to scale the way that they wanted to, if they didn't take
[9814.60 --> 9815.44]  that outside investment.
[9815.64 --> 9815.94]  Right.
[9815.94 --> 9821.84]  Because the money that they needed to keep driving forward was just not good enough when
[9821.84 --> 9824.14]  they were staying, uh, completely nonprofit.
[9824.28 --> 9825.24]  That's a tough one, man.
[9825.28 --> 9826.72]  I really don't know what to do.
[9826.72 --> 9833.36]  Like, I can tell you now, it's not today and it's not tomorrow, but I can see a wall.
[9834.48 --> 9835.22]  Where you can't.
[9835.34 --> 9835.46]  Yeah.
[9835.50 --> 9836.90]  Because, I mean, we've talked about this.
[9836.98 --> 9839.40]  It's already, it's not that bad right now.
[9839.80 --> 9840.02]  Yeah.
[9840.06 --> 9840.86]  But it could get worse.
[9841.56 --> 9842.82]  Transporting between these two buildings.
[9842.88 --> 9843.04]  Yeah.
[9843.06 --> 9843.72]  It's a pain in the butt.
[9843.82 --> 9844.34]  It's rough.
[9844.46 --> 9845.28]  I recognize that.
[9845.28 --> 9848.80]  I mean, I have people complain about it internally and I'm kind of sitting here going, okay,
[9848.98 --> 9849.22]  well.
[9849.48 --> 9849.90]  What do we do?
[9850.14 --> 9850.28]  Yeah.
[9850.34 --> 9852.10]  Well, what do we do?
[9852.18 --> 9857.56]  Because we can, we can lease and we can be at the mercy of a landlord who in five years,
[9857.62 --> 9862.88]  which we have to, we have to think long-term like that in five years might mean we have
[9862.88 --> 9864.88]  to move, just like pick up and move.
[9865.06 --> 9865.88]  Which is brutal.
[9865.88 --> 9867.90]  Or you have to build all these sets and stuff.
[9868.12 --> 9870.84]  Even worse, uh, we might not be able to find anything.
[9870.84 --> 9876.16]  So our base might move 10, 20, 45 minutes.
[9876.28 --> 9877.00]  I don't know.
[9877.10 --> 9878.58]  I don't know where we're going to be.
[9878.84 --> 9881.94]  And now you need like a campus sized place.
[9882.34 --> 9891.50]  Um, or, or, or we buy something, which is not an option anymore without outside investment.
[9892.12 --> 9897.16]  Um, like there's, there's just, there's, there's no way with the way that you go up in the scale
[9897.16 --> 9898.34]  that you would need to go up.
[9898.42 --> 9898.68]  Yeah.
[9899.04 --> 9899.74]  Without that money.
[9899.74 --> 9900.88]  It's just impossible.
[9902.24 --> 9906.96]  So like there's, there's inflection points and at those inflection points, you have to
[9906.96 --> 9907.72]  do the best you can.
[9907.82 --> 9910.96]  And I think where I'm trying to figure out where we got lost in the trees.
[9911.08 --> 9912.26]  I know I got lost in the trees.
[9912.38 --> 9913.62]  I'm trying to figure out where that was.
[9914.10 --> 9919.76]  A point that I was trying to make was that if you are 100% certain that a certain entity
[9919.76 --> 9922.78]  is bad, you shouldn't work with them.
[9923.70 --> 9927.48]  I mean, well, yeah, that's the like point I was trying to make.
[9928.10 --> 9928.46]  Okay.
[9928.46 --> 9931.70]  Uh, but like there's also degrees of bad.
[9932.08 --> 9932.48]  Yeah.
[9932.60 --> 9934.62]  And you might be okay with mildly bad.
[9935.00 --> 9937.20]  Someone else might not be okay with mildly bad.
[9937.20 --> 9943.92]  And there might be like, okay, there's a mild amount of bad, but the amount of good that it also brings.
[9944.42 --> 9945.72]  Can supersede that.
[9945.80 --> 9951.56]  Or the amount of gain that we get from this mild bad is so high that we can use that gain to create significantly more good.
[9951.66 --> 9952.66]  That's a dangerous one.
[9952.86 --> 9953.76]  It's all dangerous.
[9954.14 --> 9954.42]  Yeah.
[9954.42 --> 9955.66]  It's all difficult conversations.
[9955.66 --> 9956.14]  It's all difficult conversations.
[9956.14 --> 9956.56]  Particularly dangerous.
[9957.00 --> 9958.60]  It's all kind of rough.
[9959.32 --> 9960.48]  It's all kind of rough.
[9960.58 --> 9961.80]  We're going to build a good product.
[9962.60 --> 9962.82]  Yeah.
[9963.16 --> 9965.14]  That's what I can say for sure.
[9965.28 --> 9966.28]  Something that lasts.
[9966.54 --> 9967.78]  Something that we can stand behind.
[9967.94 --> 9969.20]  It's going to be okay.
[9969.98 --> 9971.12]  Um, everyone can relax.
[9971.20 --> 9971.86]  That's the goal.
[9971.86 --> 9977.12]  Uh, KG4WWN on float plane says, I dare you to try to sell your stuff on QVC.
[9977.90 --> 9978.66]  What is that?
[9978.86 --> 9979.26]  QVC.
[9979.38 --> 9980.08]  It's like the shopping.
[9980.16 --> 9980.94]  Is that the TV thing?
[9980.98 --> 9981.16]  Yeah.
[9981.28 --> 9981.42]  Yeah.
[9981.42 --> 9981.62]  Yeah.
[9981.62 --> 9981.70]  Yeah.
[9982.28 --> 9984.60]  Um, also Sydney Brokett says, I have a marketing degree.
[9985.02 --> 9986.68]  Uh, this isn't all that marketing entails.
[9986.68 --> 9989.34]  Marketing can include pre-development conversations.
[9989.34 --> 9991.42]  Like how do we make a product that fits the market?
[9992.06 --> 9992.62]  Um, yes.
[9992.86 --> 9993.24]  Okay.
[9993.36 --> 9995.68]  But that's not the connotation of marketing.
[9996.68 --> 10000.62]  That's, that's market research, which, which, yeah.
[10000.96 --> 10001.36]  Yeah.
[10001.36 --> 10002.54]  Uh, a hundred percent.
[10002.64 --> 10003.74]  Like, I'm not going to argue with you.
[10003.78 --> 10004.02]  You're right.
[10004.08 --> 10005.30]  That's your program that you did.
[10005.62 --> 10013.32]  Uh, but when, when normies like us say marketing, we mean post-development.
[10013.34 --> 10013.56]  Yeah.
[10014.24 --> 10016.52]  Um, assisting sales.
[10016.52 --> 10018.50]  It's like, like indirect sales, essentially.
[10018.50 --> 10021.14]  I mean, they're both marketing and sales go hand in hand.
[10024.04 --> 10026.48]  All right, Dan hit us.
[10026.90 --> 10027.72]  All right.
[10027.80 --> 10028.20]  First one.
[10028.28 --> 10029.98]  Here's from John Linus.
[10029.98 --> 10032.78]  You said that physical keyboards on phones suck.
[10033.30 --> 10038.90]  If your recent experience was a landscape oriented keyboard, like you showed, then how can
[10038.90 --> 10041.54]  it be representative of portrait ones, i.e.
[10041.66 --> 10042.14]  Blackberry?
[10042.88 --> 10048.94]  Um, I mean, I checked out a Blackberry not that long ago and it sucked.
[10048.94 --> 10052.82]  Try to input a special character or an emoji.
[10053.32 --> 10065.50]  Like so much of how we communicate through text has changed since physical keyboards were the norm because of the options that we have with touchscreen keyboards.
[10065.50 --> 10078.60]  Um, so when you go back now that you are used to having every character in the alphabet and every special character at your fingertips, you kind of go, how do I even use this?
[10078.68 --> 10081.36]  Also, where is all that screen real estate when I don't need the keyboard?
[10081.36 --> 10083.32]  That's the big one.
[10083.38 --> 10085.98]  The amount that you hamper your device through that keyboard is pretty crazy.
[10086.06 --> 10089.20]  Well, the one I talked about recently was one that was like a slide.
[10089.56 --> 10091.66]  So theoretically, it didn't hamper anything.
[10091.78 --> 10092.88]  It's also super thick now.
[10092.88 --> 10093.60]  But it's also thick.
[10093.62 --> 10096.76]  And if I was going to have a super thick phone, give me even more screen.
[10097.14 --> 10097.76]  Let's go.
[10097.86 --> 10098.52]  That's a good point.
[10098.52 --> 10100.24]  Yeah, I don't know.
[10100.32 --> 10109.56]  I really like physical keys on things, but phones are kind of like an almost a weird exception to that, in my opinion.
[10111.00 --> 10122.80]  Like if you're ever using a device like out in the wild, like if you're trying to interface with like a ticketing system or whatever else, not having physical keys can be really annoying.
[10122.80 --> 10129.12]  I also find a lot of like clicker style devices, if they don't have physical keys, they just suck.
[10129.62 --> 10129.90]  Oh, yeah.
[10130.04 --> 10131.12]  Like across the board.
[10131.30 --> 10135.12]  I mean, unless they had like Apple 3D touch level haptics or something like that.
[10135.20 --> 10135.92]  Fine, fine.
[10136.02 --> 10136.42]  But they don't.
[10136.52 --> 10136.68]  No way.
[10136.86 --> 10137.42]  Yeah, exactly.
[10137.76 --> 10137.88]  Yeah.
[10138.12 --> 10141.28]  But the phone's keyboard is actually pretty good.
[10141.44 --> 10151.56]  And they have done things to try to bridge that gap like you were talking about, where like it'll almost feel like you're actually pressing a key because of how it'll like vibrate and whatever else.
[10151.56 --> 10153.98]  So, yeah, I don't know.
[10154.50 --> 10155.68]  Just do the swipe texting.
[10156.16 --> 10157.68]  Just wiggle your finger around.
[10157.78 --> 10158.10]  You're done.
[10158.80 --> 10165.02]  Yeah, I'm convinced that that's probably faster, but I'm also convinced that I'm probably never going to do it.
[10165.82 --> 10167.62]  I am never going to swipe.
[10167.88 --> 10168.10]  Yeah.
[10168.30 --> 10170.74]  I'm actually not convinced that it's faster.
[10170.94 --> 10171.16]  No?
[10171.50 --> 10172.62]  I've seen some people do it.
[10172.66 --> 10173.68]  It looks really fast.
[10173.80 --> 10178.98]  But the second I tried to do it, I was like, I'm pretty sure I can slap around this keyboard a lot faster.
[10178.98 --> 10188.50]  Yeah, and like I use, like my prediction has been trained on my phone for years and years and years and years now.
[10189.02 --> 10195.12]  So the amount of stuff that it will auto, and maybe part of my problem is that I input a lot of acronyms and stuff.
[10196.12 --> 10197.96]  A lot of what I talk about is tech.
[10198.10 --> 10201.26]  So it's things that you've like added to the library or whatever?
[10201.26 --> 10205.00]  It's things that would take forever to input manually.
[10205.76 --> 10218.02]  So even though I'm a fast typist on my phone, I still end up using autocomplete for a lot of the terms that I end up talking about because it's just faster.
[10218.30 --> 10224.72]  When you have to capitalize a bunch of crap or when it's not a real word or whatever the case may be.
[10224.72 --> 10234.76]  So using swipe while also selecting predicted input words is not something that I think I would be very good at.
[10235.84 --> 10237.10]  It's also just a learning curve.
[10237.66 --> 10238.52]  Like, okay, what?
[10238.60 --> 10243.92]  So I'll be 4% faster after being 20% slower for six months or something.
[10244.04 --> 10245.70]  It's like, is this really worth the investment?
[10246.04 --> 10251.30]  Like I've seen a lot of people argue, okay, yeah, if you're serious about input, you should use Dvorak.
[10251.30 --> 10254.10]  Like, yeah, that's nice.
[10254.22 --> 10258.56]  But with QWERTY, I'm anywhere in the range of 110 to 130 words per minute.
[10258.66 --> 10265.18]  I can literally transcribe an entire meeting with someone while conducting the meeting without thinking about it at all.
[10265.52 --> 10267.14]  That has a value to me.
[10267.26 --> 10270.36]  Like, you know, you ask how I do something like the Micron Factory Tour.
[10270.82 --> 10276.28]  That's how I transcribe because it's more than like I could just record it.
[10276.68 --> 10276.94]  Right.
[10276.94 --> 10280.18]  But then I have to go back and read it by transcribing it.
[10280.28 --> 10286.46]  The act of creating that transcription tells me where all of those things are in the document.
[10286.56 --> 10295.66]  It allows me to format it the way that I want instead of just relying on some stupid app to hopefully know who was talking to who and which words mattered and which ones didn't.
[10297.14 --> 10297.62]  Yeah, sure.
[10297.70 --> 10298.26]  Dvorak, great.
[10298.34 --> 10298.96]  It sounds great.
[10299.38 --> 10300.42]  I like efficiency.
[10300.42 --> 10309.76]  But it is more efficient for me to keep my brain completely free of thinking about how to type and focused on a conversation or like a meeting that I'm sitting in.
[10310.40 --> 10316.12]  My thing with Dvorak, I've always been very interested in it, but I just use other people's computers sometimes.
[10316.78 --> 10321.38]  And I don't want to go up to the keyboard and just be like, oh, I'm like tripping over my own fingers.
[10321.56 --> 10323.00]  I want to be able to use it properly.
[10323.00 --> 10323.44]  Yeah.
[10326.92 --> 10327.62]  Next one.
[10329.92 --> 10330.40]  Sure.
[10330.66 --> 10331.28]  Next one.
[10331.34 --> 10332.08]  Here's from Gregory.
[10332.54 --> 10336.26]  Dear Luke slash Linus, you get a call at 2 a.m.
[10336.32 --> 10340.72]  It is Linus slash Luke and they have been arrested.
[10341.10 --> 10343.94]  Before they say anything, what is your first thought as to why?
[10347.08 --> 10349.58]  She was naked.
[10350.88 --> 10352.04]  Public indecency.
[10353.00 --> 10353.66]  That's it?
[10353.70 --> 10354.50]  You think that's it?
[10354.84 --> 10355.18]  Yeah.
[10355.26 --> 10355.88]  I mean, what else?
[10356.00 --> 10357.02]  I mean, what are your vices?
[10357.26 --> 10358.92]  It would have had to be nudity.
[10360.90 --> 10361.30]  What?
[10361.40 --> 10363.28]  Like, I don't know why you were showing off.
[10363.40 --> 10364.78]  I don't know who dared you.
[10367.46 --> 10369.40]  But you were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[10370.26 --> 10371.08]  Oh, my goodness.
[10371.60 --> 10371.92]  Wow.
[10374.08 --> 10377.10]  No, I don't think he's like coked out.
[10377.10 --> 10380.28]  I just think that it was a...
[10380.28 --> 10381.82]  Well, that's where Twitch chat went with it.
[10382.64 --> 10385.66]  Both of these are very common occurrences, I take it.
[10386.94 --> 10387.96]  Both of these?
[10388.04 --> 10388.34]  What are you talking about?
[10388.34 --> 10390.88]  I think Luke's just like cool with being nude.
[10390.94 --> 10392.12]  I don't think it's a big deal to him.
[10392.20 --> 10397.66]  And I think that, you know, some prude cop sees him being all nude somewhere where he shouldn't be.
[10397.66 --> 10398.66]  I guess...
[10398.66 --> 10399.38]  I guess...
[10399.38 --> 10401.20]  Jaden, come on!
[10403.10 --> 10404.38]  Jaden's like...
[10404.38 --> 10407.00]  He literally does this all the time at the most Luke thing.
[10407.20 --> 10407.92]  Come on.
[10408.40 --> 10414.64]  I guess, like, peeing out in nature is a form of public indecency.
[10414.82 --> 10415.26]  It sure is.
[10415.34 --> 10415.52]  Yeah.
[10415.86 --> 10416.94]  So, I mean, it could happen.
[10417.16 --> 10417.38]  Yeah.
[10417.46 --> 10418.34]  I've done that for sure.
[10418.96 --> 10419.36]  Sure.
[10419.60 --> 10419.76]  Yeah.
[10419.84 --> 10420.00]  Yeah.
[10420.00 --> 10420.52]  Okay.
[10424.36 --> 10424.80]  Assault.
[10425.38 --> 10425.82]  What?
[10426.84 --> 10428.64]  Have you ever seen me hit anyone?
[10429.56 --> 10430.00]  Anything?
[10430.00 --> 10431.68]  No.
[10432.08 --> 10435.00]  But I could see a reality where...
[10435.66 --> 10438.00]  Oh, I see where you're going with this.
[10438.00 --> 10439.90]  I don't know how far down that conversation I want to go.
[10439.92 --> 10441.06]  Yeah, I don't think we're going to do that.
[10443.02 --> 10443.98]  Okay, moving on.
[10444.74 --> 10445.96]  This got very real.
[10448.54 --> 10449.06]  Next up.
[10449.06 --> 10450.68]  I love leaving that vague.
[10450.88 --> 10451.70]  That's amazing.
[10452.08 --> 10455.58]  We could give some, like, hints, but I love leaving it vague.
[10455.58 --> 10462.70]  Oh, man.
[10463.08 --> 10463.90]  That's amazing.
[10464.20 --> 10465.00]  Yeah, let's move on.
[10465.06 --> 10465.42]  Next one.
[10465.50 --> 10466.04]  All right, Ian.
[10466.30 --> 10467.90]  Happy Friday, Luke and Linus.
[10471.86 --> 10476.70]  What tech-related job do you think will take the longest for AI to take over?
[10477.02 --> 10478.08]  Well, this one's just for Luke.
[10479.20 --> 10479.42]  Oh.
[10479.88 --> 10480.96]  Dude, I have no idea.
[10482.02 --> 10483.34]  Oh, also get owned.
[10483.34 --> 10485.60]  The longest for AI to take over?
[10486.64 --> 10489.68]  I was going to say developing AIs, but that's not even true.
[10489.84 --> 10492.66]  They're, like, already working on each other and stuff.
[10492.94 --> 10493.12]  Yep.
[10494.08 --> 10495.36]  It's really tough.
[10495.50 --> 10501.60]  I think if you knew the answer to this, you would probably find some way to get extremely rich over the next little bit,
[10501.66 --> 10506.32]  because that is a question that, like, everyone is trying to figure out right now.
[10506.32 --> 10515.14]  How about, like, the business engagement side of tech?
[10515.92 --> 10524.74]  So the actual, like, schmoozing that takes place where companies work on integrating each other's tech and making deals.
[10524.74 --> 10531.88]  I think that while you and I might go, well, they could easily take over that by just writing emails.
[10531.88 --> 10535.52]  It's already integrated into Office and it's integrated into Gmail or whatever.
[10536.06 --> 10544.08]  I think you and I both know that even though it's not really our thing, a lot of business is done over drinks, over shared experiences.
[10544.84 --> 10545.48]  Totally is, yeah.
[10545.48 --> 10549.36]  Whereas you and I issue all forms of social contact.
[10551.72 --> 10553.06]  So we don't really get it.
[10554.50 --> 10565.34]  But there's a lot of times that I've encountered people in my career where I would send an email and get ghosted or get blown off.
[10565.44 --> 10571.44]  And then I would run into them at a party at CES or something, say literally exactly the same f***ing thing.
[10571.52 --> 10573.12]  Then bridge that connection and that's a deal.
[10573.12 --> 10577.06]  All of a sudden they're down to do a deal because we hung out or something.
[10577.20 --> 10579.72]  And I'm kind of like, that's f***ing stupid.
[10581.64 --> 10583.52]  But I can't change that.
[10583.90 --> 10585.88]  I have to play the game, right?
[10586.62 --> 10589.12]  I think it will be...
[10590.64 --> 10593.84]  My jump is, like, infrastructure maintenance.
[10596.88 --> 10597.52]  Because...
[10597.52 --> 10600.28]  So, like, the actual hardware maintenance?
[10600.40 --> 10600.60]  Yeah.
[10600.60 --> 10601.36]  Or, okay.
[10601.36 --> 10603.64]  My job's safe.
[10603.96 --> 10604.64]  Because you could...
[10604.64 --> 10605.30]  For now.
[10605.44 --> 10605.90]  For now.
[10606.40 --> 10609.72]  Because you can, like, automate a lot of that with robots and you can do whatever.
[10610.10 --> 10611.92]  But what if that's the problem?
[10614.04 --> 10618.10]  What if the, like, networking that connects everything goes down for whatever reason?
[10619.48 --> 10619.80]  Sure.
[10620.12 --> 10620.28]  Yeah.
[10620.28 --> 10620.80]  All right.
[10621.28 --> 10621.52]  Yeah.
[10621.64 --> 10622.06]  I don't know.
[10622.18 --> 10626.44]  I think those were both valid answers and we should not be angry with each other anymore tonight.
[10626.44 --> 10633.04]  They don't like it when mom and dad fight.
[10633.62 --> 10636.72]  Well, that's why I was trying to tell everyone to, like, just don't...
[10636.72 --> 10637.82]  You guys still love each other, right?
[10637.82 --> 10638.56]  There's no...
[10638.56 --> 10639.20]  There's not...
[10639.20 --> 10639.70]  It's not my fault.
[10640.18 --> 10641.74]  Did I do a bad job producing?
[10641.88 --> 10642.34]  I'm sorry.
[10642.46 --> 10642.72]  It's Dan's fault.
[10642.72 --> 10643.04]  Yes.
[10643.16 --> 10643.86]  It's Dan's fault.
[10643.86 --> 10644.48]  It's Dan's fault.
[10644.48 --> 10644.56]  100%.
[10644.56 --> 10646.22]  He's the wedge that came between us.
[10646.22 --> 10648.90]  One thing that we agree on is that it's your fault.
[10653.40 --> 10653.92]  Okay.
[10657.26 --> 10658.52]  Next up is from Casey.
[10659.16 --> 10663.88]  Linus and Luke, what's something you've always wanted to talk about on stream but no one has ever asked?
[10665.28 --> 10667.56]  What has no one ever asked me?
[10667.58 --> 10668.82]  A lot of hard questions.
[10669.08 --> 10670.94]  People ask me some weird stuff.
[10670.94 --> 10671.34]  But...
[10671.34 --> 10678.08]  Yeah, like, what have you never been asked about on stream?
[10678.88 --> 10679.24]  Yeah.
[10679.46 --> 10685.04]  I mean, maybe not technically stream, but so much of my life has been lived in front of the camera.
[10685.34 --> 10685.36]  Yes.
[10685.78 --> 10686.92]  A lot of topics...
[10686.92 --> 10687.50]  You know what?
[10687.76 --> 10691.54]  I think this would have been a lot easier if we had never done the roast.
[10691.54 --> 10699.32]  A lot of things were talked about about me in public.
[10700.14 --> 10701.54]  That was a pretty transparent...
[10702.28 --> 10702.76]  Yeah.
[10703.16 --> 10703.46]  Yeah.
[10703.86 --> 10709.54]  Yeah, I mean, if you read between the lines correctly, especially with the people who know me best...
[10711.02 --> 10713.64]  Pretty much all my dirty laundry's out there, baby.
[10713.64 --> 10721.16]  Yeah, like, I feel like this and the degree to which you have been on camera more is absurd.
[10721.64 --> 10724.68]  So, like, yeah, I don't think there's much.
[10724.98 --> 10727.86]  And it's like, this is what we've wanted to talk about.
[10727.96 --> 10731.30]  And, like, the problem with that is, like, that no one's ever asked.
[10731.40 --> 10733.94]  Like, we don't just talk about what people ask.
[10734.78 --> 10735.22]  Yeah.
[10736.00 --> 10737.40]  No one's ever asked.
[10737.40 --> 10740.28]  I mean, I don't really have a life.
[10741.78 --> 10742.76]  No, really, though.
[10742.84 --> 10744.38]  What do I do?
[10744.52 --> 10747.12]  I mean, let's go through my week, right?
[10747.24 --> 10750.40]  So, you know, one day a week, I...
[10750.40 --> 10752.80]  Technically, I'm off Mondays.
[10753.42 --> 10758.90]  So, on Mondays, I usually attend the All Hands Monday morning meeting,
[10759.60 --> 10765.02]  after which I will usually sit down and, like, look at a couple emails and stuff or whatever,
[10765.12 --> 10766.54]  because I'm already at my computer anyway.
[10766.54 --> 10770.52]  After which I have our writer's meeting, which is about two hours.
[10771.00 --> 10772.14]  He's off on Mondays.
[10772.26 --> 10774.72]  That's why I looked weird when he said I'm off on Mondays.
[10774.82 --> 10775.90]  I'm like, yeah, sure, dude.
[10776.00 --> 10780.26]  After which people usually have a couple of things to follow up with me from the meetings.
[10781.06 --> 10784.14]  After which I have an activity with my kids.
[10784.24 --> 10785.40]  So I do manage to do that.
[10785.52 --> 10786.44]  And then I eat.
[10786.68 --> 10787.86]  When I'm done that, I eat dinner.
[10788.46 --> 10789.12]  So, like...
[10789.12 --> 10791.82]  Yeah, we were at the end of the day, basically, when he said that.
[10791.82 --> 10793.60]  So, work and kids.
[10794.18 --> 10794.58]  All right.
[10794.58 --> 10796.88]  So then, let's pick another day of the week.
[10797.68 --> 10798.72]  I go to work.
[10799.58 --> 10801.56]  And then I go home and I eat.
[10801.92 --> 10803.12]  And then I go to badminton.
[10803.44 --> 10804.72]  Or I do things with my kids.
[10806.08 --> 10807.88]  And you talk about badminton on the show.
[10807.98 --> 10808.18]  Yeah.
[10808.28 --> 10809.16]  So I talk about my kids.
[10809.26 --> 10809.98]  I talk about badminton.
[10809.98 --> 10810.30]  You talk about your kids.
[10810.48 --> 10811.20]  I talk about work.
[10811.20 --> 10814.90]  That is my entire life.
[10816.12 --> 10818.00]  And then, like, there's my SO, right?
[10819.68 --> 10820.76]  We go to work together.
[10821.08 --> 10822.40]  We play badminton together.
[10822.66 --> 10823.88]  We raise our kids together.
[10824.98 --> 10825.88]  It's like, what?
[10825.92 --> 10829.36]  Do you want me to talk about the one thing we do that isn't that?
[10829.62 --> 10830.02]  Hey.
[10830.80 --> 10832.26]  Well, I mean, it's part of that.
[10832.34 --> 10833.92]  But people have definitely asked.
[10833.92 --> 10836.28]  So, it doesn't qualify.
[10836.94 --> 10837.18]  Yeah.
[10837.30 --> 10837.86]  Fair enough.
[10838.02 --> 10838.18]  Yeah.
[10838.24 --> 10838.78]  Also fair.
[10841.32 --> 10846.82]  And for me, all the other things that I do, I often find some way to work into the show
[10846.82 --> 10848.48]  if I actually feel like talking about it.
[10848.84 --> 10853.16]  Like, I've talked about the workouts and weight loss stuff that I've been doing and yada, yada, yada.
[10853.32 --> 10854.06]  So, like, I don't know.
[10854.16 --> 10855.30]  I don't think there's much, to be honest.
[10856.30 --> 10860.66]  There's a bunch of stuff that I have no interest in talking about and have not talked about.
[10860.90 --> 10861.04]  Yeah.
[10861.04 --> 10861.50]  And that's fine.
[10861.78 --> 10862.00]  Yeah.
[10862.44 --> 10863.30]  So, I don't know.
[10864.64 --> 10867.18]  Well, this makes me feel a lot better about myself.
[10868.38 --> 10868.78]  Cool.
[10868.92 --> 10869.84]  Because you have a life?
[10870.06 --> 10871.80]  No, because I'm on the same page as both of you.
[10871.80 --> 10872.22]  Oh, okay.
[10872.34 --> 10874.56]  I thought you were just slamming us.
[10874.88 --> 10877.32]  No, that was the intention to make you think that.
[10878.00 --> 10878.40]  Okay.
[10878.64 --> 10879.20]  Next up.
[10879.58 --> 10880.22]  New to the channel.
[10880.42 --> 10884.06]  And I got to say, your company is the coolest nerds I know.
[10884.30 --> 10884.64]  Nice.
[10884.64 --> 10889.62]  I have no clue about computer technology, but because of LTT, I have learned so much.
[10889.98 --> 10890.22]  Question.
[10890.56 --> 10892.92]  What's your favorite thing about Luke and Dan?
[10894.44 --> 10895.60]  Oh, is this to me?
[10895.70 --> 10896.32]  I think so.
[10896.36 --> 10897.08]  My favorite thing.
[10897.14 --> 10901.58]  Did you really curate a question asking my favorite thing about you?
[10901.86 --> 10903.06]  Apparently, it's...
[10903.06 --> 10911.38]  I love your dry wit and your uncanny willingness to do whatever the f*** you damn well please.
[10911.88 --> 10912.36]  There.
[10912.36 --> 10912.80]  Yeah.
[10914.62 --> 10915.06]  Yeah.
[10915.48 --> 10915.88]  Get owned.
[10916.58 --> 10917.96]  It's addressed to all of us.
[10918.02 --> 10922.00]  So I think Dan has to also say what his favorite thing about Luke and Dan is.
[10922.04 --> 10922.32]  Yeah.
[10922.46 --> 10923.82]  I don't even want to know mine.
[10923.92 --> 10925.52]  Just what's your favorite thing about you?
[10926.42 --> 10927.48]  I don't know.
[10927.48 --> 10928.98]  I've never been...
[10928.98 --> 10930.68]  I've never had to think about this before.
[10931.70 --> 10932.10]  Wow.
[10932.16 --> 10933.84]  This is getting like deep talk now.
[10933.94 --> 10935.76]  What's your favorite thing about yourself?
[10936.00 --> 10936.22]  Yeah.
[10937.30 --> 10937.66]  Yeah.
[10939.16 --> 10940.30]  You can find something.
[10940.52 --> 10941.12]  I believe.
[10941.32 --> 10943.62]  My ability to be interested in anything.
[10944.32 --> 10944.84]  That's cool.
[10944.96 --> 10945.42]  That's a good one.
[10945.54 --> 10945.74]  Yeah.
[10945.88 --> 10946.26]  Mm-hmm.
[10946.26 --> 10946.34]  That's lame.
[10946.56 --> 10947.98]  That's lame, but whatever.
[10948.20 --> 10948.38]  Awesome.
[10948.52 --> 10948.70]  That's good.
[10948.82 --> 10949.02]  Okay.
[10949.12 --> 10949.72]  So hold on.
[10949.76 --> 10950.62]  I got to do Luke now.
[10950.82 --> 10951.26]  Oh, boy.
[10952.08 --> 10953.84]  I was hoping we were going to dodge this bullet.
[10954.02 --> 10954.50]  My...
[10954.50 --> 10954.72]  Yeah.
[10954.78 --> 10957.76]  I saw how you tried to redirect that, but I was right there with you.
[10957.76 --> 10976.90]  I think my favorite thing about Luke is how we either mind meld or completely disagree.
[10977.14 --> 10978.28]  We're fusion and vision.
[10978.28 --> 10980.32]  We still manage to make it work.
[10980.44 --> 10980.92]  Yeah.
[10981.02 --> 10987.24]  That's what gives us the dynamic that you guys like so much, I think, is we'll go, yeah,
[10987.24 --> 10988.86]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10988.86 --> 10989.24]  Yes, no.
[10989.34 --> 10989.48]  Wait.
[10991.48 --> 10991.80]  Hmm.
[10992.00 --> 10995.20]  I mean, we saw it.
[10995.20 --> 10996.34]  We saw it today, right?
[10996.42 --> 10997.46]  Like, it's...
[10997.46 --> 11006.28]  The people I tend to be most successful surrounding myself with are the ones that generally are aligned
[11006.28 --> 11009.56]  with me, but when we're not aligned, make me better.
[11010.18 --> 11011.18]  And so that's...
[11011.18 --> 11012.80]  If I was going to give you...
[11012.80 --> 11021.52]  If I was going to give you a one-line how to pick an SO, your BFF, you know, a business
[11021.52 --> 11026.16]  partner, someone that you're in it with for the long haul, that's got to be it.
[11026.42 --> 11026.76]  I had a...
[11026.76 --> 11027.42]  I had a...
[11027.42 --> 11033.96]  I had a conversation with someone recently about how they work with their partner.
[11034.96 --> 11035.32]  And...
[11035.32 --> 11036.00]  But it's not...
[11036.00 --> 11037.30]  It's not their workplace.
[11037.42 --> 11038.02]  They don't own it.
[11038.60 --> 11038.88]  They're just...
[11038.88 --> 11040.04]  Oh, they just both work at the same...
[11040.04 --> 11041.32]  They're both employees at the same place.
[11041.34 --> 11041.86]  That's scary.
[11042.14 --> 11044.30]  And one of them...
[11044.30 --> 11047.74]  This is a male-female relationship.
[11048.00 --> 11048.18]  Yeah.
[11048.46 --> 11051.20]  I'm talking to the male in this relationship.
[11051.20 --> 11051.40]  Yeah.
[11051.64 --> 11054.98]  The male in this relationship is in a leadership role.
[11056.00 --> 11056.48]  Hire.
[11058.96 --> 11061.40]  They don't directly report to each other, though.
[11061.48 --> 11061.88]  No.
[11062.02 --> 11062.36]  Okay.
[11062.36 --> 11063.08]  But...
[11063.08 --> 11064.40]  But the org chart...
[11064.40 --> 11068.24]  If you're in a meeting, this person is above.
[11069.08 --> 11076.16]  And would be placed in a situation at times where, like, if that person is super derailed
[11076.16 --> 11080.08]  or off topic or talking about whatever, they have to get them back on board.
[11082.96 --> 11083.44]  Complicated.
[11083.44 --> 11083.52]  Complicated.
[11084.92 --> 11087.20]  And I brought up...
[11087.20 --> 11092.10]  I was like, you know, I feel like you should try to dodge it in every which way you can.
[11092.74 --> 11095.54]  And Linus and I are not in a romantic relationship.
[11095.90 --> 11102.60]  But I have never found a situation where I've been in this type of role where I've been able
[11102.60 --> 11106.94]  to be, like, really good bros with someone and it's worked before.
[11106.94 --> 11107.94]  Or...
[11107.94 --> 11114.76]  Especially with someone else who will also enthusiastically defend their position.
[11115.04 --> 11116.24]  Because I do that.
[11116.82 --> 11117.20]  Yeah.
[11117.20 --> 11121.94]  And when two people do that, it's not super common that you can...
[11122.50 --> 11124.86]  Avoid bad conflict.
[11125.14 --> 11125.32]  Yeah.
[11125.46 --> 11126.62]  Good conflict is okay.
[11127.00 --> 11127.24]  Yeah.
[11127.62 --> 11129.84]  I feel like we've done a pretty good job of that.
[11130.38 --> 11130.64]  Yeah.
[11130.64 --> 11131.38]  And that's cool.
[11131.66 --> 11133.84]  But it helps that we're mostly aligned.
[11134.06 --> 11134.20]  Yeah.
[11134.20 --> 11139.68]  So we don't have to have conversations like, well, how are we going to run a forum without,
[11139.68 --> 11146.36]  you know, sound, high volume sound ads all over it?
[11146.36 --> 11148.76]  Ads that are, like, following around the screen trying to dodge your mouse and all that type
[11148.76 --> 11149.12]  of stuff.
[11149.34 --> 11149.38]  Yeah.
[11149.38 --> 11150.20]  So we don't...
[11151.04 --> 11151.46]  We don't...
[11151.46 --> 11152.26]  We have...
[11152.26 --> 11152.60]  Maybe...
[11152.60 --> 11152.84]  Okay.
[11152.94 --> 11157.44]  Maybe instead of just alignment, maybe I should have said similar principles would have been
[11157.44 --> 11159.00]  a good way to kind of phrase that.
[11159.00 --> 11163.36]  But it's definitely...
[11163.36 --> 11164.76]  It takes tending.
[11166.82 --> 11169.08]  I mean, you guys got to witness it today.
[11169.24 --> 11169.46]  Yeah.
[11169.78 --> 11170.02]  Yeah.
[11170.12 --> 11170.78]  Because you have to...
[11170.78 --> 11171.98]  You can't go to bed angry, right?
[11172.14 --> 11172.34]  Yeah.
[11172.52 --> 11174.04]  You got to resolve it at some point.
[11174.10 --> 11174.54]  It's tough.
[11174.64 --> 11176.90]  And sometimes the resolution is, you know what?
[11176.94 --> 11178.84]  You're a lot more passionate about this than I am.
[11179.36 --> 11180.74]  I guess we're going to need to back down.
[11181.10 --> 11182.28]  Or I'll need to back down.
[11182.28 --> 11187.58]  And sometimes the resolution is, I actually just really do need you to understand my point
[11187.58 --> 11187.90]  here.
[11188.06 --> 11189.88]  You need to shut the f*** up for a second.
[11191.22 --> 11192.60]  And sometimes it's in between.
[11193.18 --> 11193.40]  Right?
[11193.86 --> 11194.28]  Yeah.
[11194.64 --> 11196.04]  But you got to figure it out.
[11196.58 --> 11199.98]  I mean, Yvonne and I have had some really tough conversations.
[11200.18 --> 11200.84]  I mean, especially...
[11200.84 --> 11207.38]  Man, the stakes of everything are so low once you're raising kids together.
[11208.46 --> 11210.64]  Everything else is just like...
[11210.64 --> 11211.96]  It's like, what's work?
[11211.96 --> 11212.42]  It's like, what?
[11212.50 --> 11212.84]  Money?
[11213.44 --> 11213.64]  Yeah.
[11213.72 --> 11214.32]  Like, yeah.
[11214.44 --> 11214.62]  Yeah.
[11214.70 --> 11215.56]  Money matters.
[11215.88 --> 11218.62]  Especially when you've got 100 plus mouths to feed.
[11218.68 --> 11223.26]  If we don't make money, what's Dan going to eat?
[11226.70 --> 11227.18]  Right?
[11227.28 --> 11229.36]  So the stakes are really high.
[11229.76 --> 11234.68]  But with a child, the stakes are exponentially higher.
[11234.78 --> 11235.06]  Oh, yeah.
[11235.06 --> 11235.84]  It's their future.
[11235.84 --> 11238.52]  It's the future of everyone they ever interact with.
[11238.52 --> 11243.20]  If you're willing to sort of put that burden on yourself, right?
[11243.34 --> 11247.90]  It's the future of their spouse, their kids, their kids' kids.
[11248.36 --> 11248.40]  Right?
[11248.52 --> 11248.94]  Like, it's...
[11248.94 --> 11249.78]  Their life success.
[11250.64 --> 11251.12]  Yeah.
[11251.12 --> 11259.22]  And their life success, as small or as great as it might be, could impact the world, right?
[11259.28 --> 11261.30]  Like, the stakes are so high.
[11261.30 --> 11269.58]  And so it's just like, when we're making decisions about how to parent, those are way more intense
[11269.58 --> 11274.76]  conversations than, how are we going to organize this department for best efficiency?
[11274.96 --> 11275.54]  Here's my idea.
[11275.62 --> 11276.18]  Here's your idea.
[11276.26 --> 11276.78]  We disagree.
[11277.20 --> 11277.68]  You know what?
[11277.80 --> 11278.94]  Who the f*** cares?
[11279.34 --> 11280.16]  Let's try yours.
[11280.28 --> 11281.90]  And if it doesn't work, f*** it.
[11282.04 --> 11282.98]  We'll try the other one.
[11282.98 --> 11284.94]  Because, f*** it.
[11285.02 --> 11286.62]  Like, whatever.
[11287.10 --> 11287.30]  Yeah.
[11287.44 --> 11287.68]  You know?
[11287.78 --> 11290.02]  At the end of the day, it's all solvable, right?
[11290.10 --> 11291.42]  It's all...
[11291.42 --> 11291.98]  What?
[11292.04 --> 11295.12]  We make a little more money or make a little less money.
[11295.50 --> 11297.06]  Observe performance, potentially pivot.
[11297.52 --> 11297.74]  Yeah.
[11297.80 --> 11299.68]  Whereas, like, with kids, well, you get one shot.
[11299.86 --> 11300.06]  Yeah.
[11300.48 --> 11305.02]  And there's certain actions that you can do that might not seem like that big of a deal,
[11305.32 --> 11309.30]  but even if done once, will, like, never be forgotten and yada yada yada.
[11309.30 --> 11311.02]  You can traumatize a living being.
[11311.02 --> 11317.02]  And there's no, like, if that person deeply disagrees with your action, they...
[11317.66 --> 11320.66]  So much resentment can blossom out of that seed.
[11320.84 --> 11322.60]  And you're always their dad.
[11323.02 --> 11324.10]  She's always their mom.
[11324.36 --> 11328.14]  So, like, they can't just, like, quit and go to another company and not care.
[11329.88 --> 11331.06]  Stakes her real high.
[11331.22 --> 11331.82]  Stakes her real high.
[11331.82 --> 11334.36]  There's a form of that, obviously, but there's, like...
[11334.36 --> 11336.20]  I mean, yeah, emanciation or whatever it's called.
[11336.20 --> 11339.02]  Yeah, like, there's things that you can do, but there's some amount of...
[11339.02 --> 11339.34]  No, emancipation?
[11339.86 --> 11340.32]  I don't know.
[11340.32 --> 11342.88]  Emanciation is where you're, like, unhealthy, I think.
[11343.14 --> 11343.98]  You just run away.
[11344.68 --> 11346.32]  And I think emancipation, yeah.
[11346.42 --> 11351.34]  But, like, that's not easy and that's potentially emotionally damaging and all that type of stuff.
[11351.52 --> 11352.66]  Like, it's just very...
[11352.66 --> 11354.18]  And it could be worse than it was, you know?
[11354.32 --> 11354.50]  Yeah.
[11354.84 --> 11355.44]  Yep, yep, yep.
[11356.28 --> 11357.50]  Mystical and full-plean chat.
[11357.58 --> 11359.82]  My kids are basically loving and very feral.
[11360.06 --> 11360.82]  How do I fix?
[11360.82 --> 11365.86]  Well, usually, when I want to fix a feral creature, I go to the vet.
[11366.80 --> 11367.20]  Sorry.
[11367.78 --> 11368.56]  We can move on.
[11369.52 --> 11371.00]  Speaking of ways to affect their lives.
[11373.50 --> 11373.90]  Next.
[11374.22 --> 11374.44]  Okay.
[11374.98 --> 11379.40]  Do you think that the size of LTT is damaging to smaller tech channels?
[11379.76 --> 11383.26]  Some smaller tech channels have expressed in the past that they aren't doing very well
[11383.26 --> 11385.24]  and that it's hard to compete with LTT.
[11388.24 --> 11388.64]  Sorry?
[11388.64 --> 11396.90]  I think I would have to wager with how algorithmic stuff works.
[11398.50 --> 11399.08]  Hey, wait.
[11399.14 --> 11399.70]  Hold on a second.
[11399.78 --> 11400.76]  No, we've got to back up for a second.
[11400.86 --> 11402.22]  Luke dodged answering about himself.
[11403.04 --> 11403.28]  What?
[11403.34 --> 11403.80]  I don't think so.
[11403.82 --> 11404.28]  Thank you, chat.
[11404.40 --> 11405.70]  You didn't say your favorite thing about you.
[11406.46 --> 11407.22]  Oh, boy.
[11408.22 --> 11408.70]  Thanks, chat.
[11408.80 --> 11409.68]  It's hard, isn't it?
[11412.22 --> 11414.00]  Well, I'm going to switch over to Luke Cam here.
[11414.10 --> 11414.42]  Why?
[11414.60 --> 11415.02]  I don't know.
[11415.16 --> 11416.66]  And you thought this was a bad question.
[11417.66 --> 11418.42]  I don't know.
[11418.42 --> 11422.10]  I feel like all the things that I like about myself have very intense downsides.
[11424.30 --> 11427.84]  I like that I go hard, but then I take a long time to recover.
[11428.04 --> 11428.42]  Yeah.
[11429.02 --> 11430.42]  Yeah, like...
[11430.42 --> 11432.14]  Actually, though.
[11432.42 --> 11434.30]  Like, they all have super big negatives.
[11434.30 --> 11436.92]  I like that I'm really loyal, but sometimes I do things that are kind of dumb
[11436.92 --> 11438.20]  and not in my own best interest.
[11438.84 --> 11439.20]  Yeah.
[11439.82 --> 11441.56]  I mean, if it helps at all, Luke.
[11441.70 --> 11445.90]  The answer that I gave is also incredibly damaging every single day.
[11445.90 --> 11452.06]  I think it's probably the second one Linus mentioned.
[11452.06 --> 11460.86]  I like that I stick with people and ideas, but that can also suck a lot.
[11460.86 --> 11469.48]  Like, going back, going way back, you should not have stuck with the NCIX tech tips paradigm.
[11469.78 --> 11469.98]  No.
[11470.16 --> 11471.54]  That was actually stupid.
[11471.66 --> 11471.90]  Yeah.
[11472.16 --> 11473.38]  Like, you had so much potential.
[11473.38 --> 11474.82]  I can see why your parents were mad.
[11475.02 --> 11475.36]  Oh, yeah.
[11475.42 --> 11476.54]  You had all this potential.
[11476.54 --> 11481.08]  Like, super bright future, and you were wasting your time falling asleep behind the camera
[11481.08 --> 11486.30]  at some tech store with this, like, guy who's not even very senior at the company or anything.
[11486.30 --> 11489.34]  Just like, what are you even doing, son?
[11489.54 --> 11495.92]  I had job offers that were twice as much as the starting wage at this company, let alone
[11495.92 --> 11496.98]  in NCIX.
[11496.98 --> 11501.62]  But that was, yeah, that was, I don't know.
[11502.12 --> 11505.22]  But I like that, and look, I'm happy with how that resulted.
[11506.06 --> 11507.20]  So, like, I don't know.
[11507.28 --> 11508.50]  So he learned nothing.
[11508.94 --> 11510.34]  I'll f***ing do it again.
[11510.44 --> 11510.74]  Yeah.
[11511.26 --> 11514.50]  That, okay, that line right there is also a big part of me.
[11514.76 --> 11518.52]  Which, which sometimes is great, and other times it's terrible.
[11518.74 --> 11519.32]  I don't know.
[11519.52 --> 11520.98]  A lot of...
[11520.98 --> 11525.32]  Have you ever done those, like, personality test things?
[11526.80 --> 11527.96]  Probably at some point.
[11528.02 --> 11528.54]  Not recently.
[11528.54 --> 11533.92]  I rank, like, 99th or 0th percentile in everything.
[11535.68 --> 11537.46]  No half-meshes, Luke!
[11540.22 --> 11544.90]  I've even had other people take the test as if they were me.
[11545.16 --> 11545.40]  Yeah.
[11545.56 --> 11548.10]  Because I'm like, am I just, like, skewing this or whatever?
[11548.24 --> 11549.08]  And they're like, whoa.
[11549.08 --> 11553.04]  It ended up on, like, the far reaches of every category.
[11553.20 --> 11553.86]  And I'm like, cool.
[11554.04 --> 11556.00]  I don't know how comfortable I am with this.
[11558.20 --> 11558.60]  Yeah.
[11558.78 --> 11559.46]  So, I don't know.
[11559.62 --> 11563.48]  There's, I don't, I don't, there's things I think of positively about myself.
[11563.62 --> 11566.76]  But all of those things have downsides.
[11566.96 --> 11569.06]  And I'm just, I'm okay with it at this point.
[11569.12 --> 11569.60]  It's fine.
[11569.72 --> 11570.46]  I'm over it.
[11571.42 --> 11571.82]  Yeah.
[11571.96 --> 11572.36]  All right.
[11572.38 --> 11572.68]  Sorry.
[11572.78 --> 11574.52]  Can you read that question again?
[11576.14 --> 11578.70]  Some smaller tech channels have expressed in the past
[11578.70 --> 11581.88]  that they aren't doing very well due to the size of LTT.
[11582.22 --> 11583.40]  And it's hard to compete.
[11584.98 --> 11586.52]  Do you think that's damaging to them?
[11589.02 --> 11590.10]  Well, what do you want?
[11590.16 --> 11593.00]  Do you want me to, like, not make the best content we can make?
[11593.20 --> 11596.76]  What is it about our size that's problematic, I guess, would be my question.
[11596.76 --> 11602.26]  Because if anything, our size has felt like...
[11602.26 --> 11602.78]  Rising tide.
[11602.78 --> 11611.14]  A, that we have legitimized a lot of the forms of monetization that smaller creators take for granted
[11611.14 --> 11618.12]  that didn't exist or that were a source of huge audience blowback back when we first started doing it.
[11618.14 --> 11619.28]  Broke ground on ad spots.
[11619.28 --> 11624.54]  We have legitimized advertising in the tech YouTuber space.
[11624.62 --> 11625.16]  You're welcome.
[11625.68 --> 11630.38]  And I don't just mean this as, like, look how out of touch and arrogant Linus is.
[11630.52 --> 11631.48]  But no, for real.
[11631.48 --> 11642.04]  Like, we shifted advertising budgets from written media and forums and, like, traditional magazines.
[11642.78 --> 11643.32]  TV ads.
[11644.04 --> 11648.78]  From many of the brand partners that these smaller tech creators are working with today.
[11649.32 --> 11652.48]  We fought through that, getting it reallocated to YouTube.
[11652.88 --> 11655.88]  And everyone now gets to enjoy the fruit of that.
[11656.08 --> 11657.46]  We weren't the only ones.
[11657.60 --> 11658.70]  Not even a little bit.
[11658.70 --> 11661.52]  But we were very much the tip of the spear.
[11662.58 --> 11664.90]  I'm not going to apologize for any of that.
[11665.58 --> 11670.08]  Because a lot of that rising tides thing that Luke was talking about,
[11670.24 --> 11673.70]  a lot of that ecosystem simply doesn't exist if...
[11674.36 --> 11675.66]  Or would have taken longer.
[11675.84 --> 11679.70]  Wouldn't be as mature if we hadn't taken the...
[11680.30 --> 11683.46]  Been brutalized by the audience for a lot of the things that we've done
[11683.46 --> 11685.42]  that are now just accepted as common practice.
[11685.42 --> 11688.82]  Because, no, I don't think they were bad.
[11688.90 --> 11689.76]  I think they were fine.
[11689.86 --> 11691.38]  I think people just weren't used to it.
[11692.58 --> 11695.62]  So, I'm not gonna...
[11695.62 --> 11698.42]  Yeah, I'm not gonna apologize for...
[11698.42 --> 11703.50]  For, you know, killing it over the years.
[11703.50 --> 11709.26]  I think that in some ways, it's easier than ever to break out on YouTube,
[11709.26 --> 11710.22]  to be discovered.
[11710.46 --> 11711.58]  In some ways, it's harder.
[11711.84 --> 11714.96]  I've talked about how I think it's harder to become a mega-sized channel.
[11715.18 --> 11718.32]  And Mr. Who's the Boss is the only evidence I've seen in recent years
[11718.32 --> 11719.80]  that you can even still do it at all.
[11719.84 --> 11720.92]  But absolutely did it.
[11722.06 --> 11726.90]  But, I would also like to point out that we've become a very big ship.
[11726.90 --> 11729.66]  And we've become kind of difficult to steer.
[11729.86 --> 11732.02]  And that's one of the things that we're trying to address
[11732.02 --> 11735.88]  is because it can be a competitive disadvantage for us
[11735.88 --> 11739.76]  to be a jack-of-all-trades master of none sometimes.
[11740.42 --> 11744.12]  And when something breaking happens,
[11744.52 --> 11746.10]  who's the first one on top of it?
[11746.10 --> 11751.70]  Is it the one-person band creators that are like,
[11751.80 --> 11753.70]  I see this now,
[11753.92 --> 11758.26]  and I am going to pick up my phone and go now.
[11758.40 --> 11765.02]  Are they the ones who are able to jump on top of highly topical trends?
[11765.18 --> 11766.14]  Or is it us,
[11766.58 --> 11768.96]  where we have to go and have a meeting
[11768.96 --> 11772.84]  about our production schedule and our release schedule
[11772.84 --> 11775.86]  and the availability of our shooting team?
[11775.86 --> 11777.36]  Or to be topical for this show,
[11777.44 --> 11780.42]  the ethics of potentially covering that topic.
[11780.74 --> 11781.88]  We also try to...
[11781.88 --> 11785.00]  We are a large company with people that have scheduled hours.
[11785.48 --> 11787.44]  So, like, people don't work weekends.
[11788.06 --> 11789.24]  What if something happens on a weekend?
[11789.58 --> 11791.42]  We simply cannot deal with it.
[11791.42 --> 11794.64]  What if something happens on a late night on a WAN show?
[11795.30 --> 11797.80]  We might get less coverage of that thing than other people
[11797.80 --> 11801.12]  because those people make reaction content to it.
[11801.32 --> 11804.28]  And then we don't make anything about it until Monday
[11804.28 --> 11805.50]  because people are off on the weekends.
[11805.86 --> 11806.86]  It's...
[11806.86 --> 11808.86]  Yeah, I don't know.
[11808.94 --> 11810.52]  Sir Benny on Twitch says,
[11810.86 --> 11811.88]  I believe the excuse...
[11812.46 --> 11813.50]  Using the excuse of,
[11813.74 --> 11815.30]  look at the advantage of the competition
[11815.30 --> 11816.64]  instead of thinking,
[11816.88 --> 11819.12]  what could I improve isn't exactly productive.
[11819.34 --> 11820.16]  What are we supposed to improve?
[11820.38 --> 11820.88]  Well, no, no.
[11820.98 --> 11823.52]  I think this is from the other side.
[11823.52 --> 11824.20]  Oh, okay.
[11824.34 --> 11824.50]  Yeah.
[11824.50 --> 11827.16]  Like, yes, we have an advantage,
[11827.42 --> 11829.40]  but are you going to say we didn't fight for it?
[11831.66 --> 11833.14]  I mean, of course we did.
[11834.46 --> 11836.96]  And we got a little lucky.
[11837.50 --> 11839.28]  Right place, right time, for sure.
[11839.66 --> 11839.82]  Yep.
[11839.82 --> 11843.84]  But we also fought tooth and nail for every part of it.
[11844.48 --> 11844.64]  So...
[11844.64 --> 11845.34]  I can attest to that.
[11845.40 --> 11850.02]  I'm never going to apologize for succeeding.
[11851.02 --> 11852.82]  I'm never going to...
[11852.82 --> 11856.68]  I'm never going to try to do anything other than my best.
[11856.94 --> 11860.66]  I would also argue that we absolutely feel the ups and downs
[11860.66 --> 11862.18]  of the platform as well.
[11862.38 --> 11865.02]  And I think this is specifically targeting...
[11865.02 --> 11867.60]  It says in here, smaller channels.
[11867.60 --> 11871.88]  So it's possible that there's a line, right?
[11872.18 --> 11874.80]  Of like, this is the line of acceptable dip.
[11875.68 --> 11879.12]  Like, if we dip below a certain line and stay down there,
[11879.18 --> 11880.12]  we can't survive.
[11880.66 --> 11880.78]  Yep.
[11881.54 --> 11882.68]  Everybody's going to have that.
[11882.80 --> 11884.10]  If you're at a smaller channel,
[11884.20 --> 11887.16]  that line might be a lot higher.
[11888.48 --> 11890.56]  Because you're like average...
[11890.56 --> 11892.58]  It's more difficult to survive.
[11893.32 --> 11895.04]  And when those dips happen,
[11895.12 --> 11896.86]  they might feel a lot more intense
[11896.86 --> 11898.20]  because that line is higher.
[11898.68 --> 11900.40]  And that sucks, but like...
[11900.40 --> 11903.44]  But we've also taken a lot of risks along the way.
[11903.54 --> 11907.64]  We've increased the minimum threshold
[11907.64 --> 11909.34]  by hiring so many people,
[11909.44 --> 11911.66]  by aggressively reinvesting in content
[11911.66 --> 11912.86]  to the point where...
[11913.98 --> 11916.70]  Again, I'm not going to apologize for it.
[11917.10 --> 11918.62]  We have to go hard
[11918.62 --> 11920.30]  because if we don't go hard, we die.
[11920.92 --> 11924.18]  And that dip is as dangerous to us
[11924.18 --> 11926.26]  as it is to you as an organization.
[11926.26 --> 11928.46]  Maybe not as dangerous to me personally
[11928.46 --> 11932.92]  because I've been doing this for a really long time.
[11933.12 --> 11935.88]  Like, I've, you know, got the house and the car, you know?
[11936.04 --> 11937.74]  Like, all right, cool.
[11938.16 --> 11938.38]  Barbecue.
[11938.76 --> 11941.30]  But there's a lot of other people here
[11941.30 --> 11943.42]  that still got to get some.
[11943.84 --> 11945.78]  And so we're not going to take our foot off the pedal.
[11945.78 --> 11951.52]  Like, everyone inside this company is a smaller creator.
[11952.34 --> 11952.94]  So what?
[11953.00 --> 11955.56]  I should prioritize an external smaller creator
[11955.56 --> 11957.36]  over an internal smaller creator?
[11957.42 --> 11957.86]  Why would I do that?
[11957.86 --> 11958.44]  One of my problems, too, is like,
[11958.48 --> 11959.60]  how would you even do that?
[11960.26 --> 11960.66]  I don't know.
[11960.66 --> 11960.98]  I don't know.
[11961.36 --> 11961.68]  Yeah.
[11961.96 --> 11963.80]  I mean, here, Luke was talking about dips.
[11963.84 --> 11965.68]  I don't know how well you guys can see this from there.
[11965.80 --> 11966.48]  Yeah, not too well.
[11966.72 --> 11967.10]  You know what?
[11967.16 --> 11969.38]  Here, let's switch to Linus cam.
[11969.64 --> 11970.30]  Meep, meep, meep, meep.
[11970.90 --> 11971.20]  Cool.
[11972.02 --> 11973.90]  So, you know, this is our view chart
[11973.90 --> 11977.00]  over the entire lifetime of the channel, right?
[11977.12 --> 11978.40]  And so you can see here,
[11978.96 --> 11980.30]  meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep,
[11980.30 --> 11981.20]  hockey stick moment.
[11981.40 --> 11983.00]  That was when I started focusing on content
[11983.00 --> 11985.32]  after we hired Nick as our, like, business guy.
[11987.16 --> 11988.74]  And then it goes up, and then it goes down.
[11988.80 --> 11990.82]  That period of, like, four months there,
[11991.02 --> 11993.54]  that, like, significant dip where we went from
[11993.54 --> 11996.44]  anywhere in the neighborhood of around
[11996.44 --> 11999.40]  three and a half to four million views a day
[11999.40 --> 12003.68]  down to a low of one and a half.
[12004.02 --> 12005.84]  No, oh, just over one.
[12008.14 --> 12011.10]  I think that was over a span of about four months.
[12011.74 --> 12013.26]  Yeah, it was about three months.
[12013.86 --> 12014.28]  Terrifying.
[12014.44 --> 12015.22]  I thought that was it.
[12015.22 --> 12018.32]  I thought that was us succumbing to the curve,
[12018.58 --> 12023.02]  is what I call the rise and fall of every online creator.
[12023.72 --> 12026.56]  Then we had a long period, about a year,
[12026.72 --> 12029.12]  of constant digging ourselves out of that.
[12029.12 --> 12031.54]  I still remember the all-hands meeting that we had
[12031.54 --> 12033.06]  about that, where I basically went,
[12033.58 --> 12037.14]  was that the one where I talked about just, like,
[12037.34 --> 12039.56]  being more authoritative and, like,
[12040.12 --> 12043.12]  being more focused and something, something?
[12043.24 --> 12044.62]  Anyway, we called an all-hands meeting
[12044.62 --> 12047.54]  and basically talked about how we need to do something,
[12047.64 --> 12049.88]  we have to change, and we need to start changing things
[12049.88 --> 12050.44]  immediately.
[12051.08 --> 12053.18]  Like, for today's upload, we need to start changing things.
[12053.90 --> 12058.24]  I think that was, we, we, I can't remember.
[12058.24 --> 12059.22]  Because here's the thing.
[12059.56 --> 12063.20]  I can't remember this meeting because we've gone through this.
[12063.66 --> 12064.52]  So here's a big dip.
[12064.80 --> 12065.56]  Then we recovered.
[12065.74 --> 12067.40]  Then we had another two-month small dip
[12067.40 --> 12069.12]  where we went from, like, four million views a day
[12069.12 --> 12072.20]  down to, like, two in a little bit.
[12072.60 --> 12074.00]  Then we came back hard.
[12074.18 --> 12076.44]  Then we went from, like, four million views a day
[12076.44 --> 12077.98]  down to, like, two again.
[12078.26 --> 12080.80]  And then now we're on an upswing that's got us now
[12080.80 --> 12081.84]  in the neighborhood of around, like,
[12081.84 --> 12083.18]  three and a half million views a day.
[12083.76 --> 12086.36]  And you gotta, like, yeah, views aren't everything,
[12086.52 --> 12087.56]  but they also kind of are
[12087.56 --> 12089.60]  because everything else is derived
[12089.60 --> 12092.64]  from how many views you can ultimately attract.
[12092.64 --> 12099.78]  It's, yeah, it's hard for everyone.
[12100.16 --> 12100.96]  It's not easy.
[12101.44 --> 12103.78]  And YouTube is constantly changing the rules.
[12103.90 --> 12105.58]  I mean, I express frustration as well.
[12105.96 --> 12108.64]  I'll send emails to our rep saying, like,
[12108.68 --> 12111.64]  hey, we're really, for sure, not doing anything differently,
[12111.64 --> 12113.68]  but we're seeing very different results.
[12113.88 --> 12115.00]  What are you guys doing over there?
[12115.56 --> 12116.88]  And it goes both ways.
[12117.12 --> 12119.48]  Like, I sent one a few months back that I was like,
[12119.54 --> 12122.12]  hey, everything's coming real easy right now.
[12122.64 --> 12123.64]  What's going on?
[12123.74 --> 12125.88]  This distresses me as much as a dip
[12125.88 --> 12128.38]  because I don't like unpredictability
[12128.38 --> 12130.24]  in the delivery of our content.
[12133.18 --> 12134.40]  So I don't know.
[12134.54 --> 12138.16]  Maybe, I don't, I feel like this is one of those responses
[12138.16 --> 12139.94]  that's gonna turn into some kind of controversy
[12139.94 --> 12141.94]  because I just, I'm uncaring
[12141.94 --> 12143.52]  or, like, I'm some kind of jerk or something.
[12143.52 --> 12145.64]  But I don't know what to tell you.
[12145.70 --> 12150.02]  I mean, we've collaborated with smaller creators many times.
[12150.20 --> 12152.02]  We're not trying to make it a negative space for anyone.
[12152.02 --> 12154.88]  Yeah, we're very open about the way that we run our business.
[12155.20 --> 12160.72]  And I think that's a benefit to creators small and large.
[12160.80 --> 12162.04]  You know, when we talk about things like
[12162.04 --> 12163.92]  how our revenue is broken down,
[12164.40 --> 12165.92]  if someone sees that and goes,
[12166.04 --> 12168.94]  holy smokes, like, I am doing basically none of this
[12168.94 --> 12170.40]  and it's 20% of their revenue,
[12170.56 --> 12171.92]  I need to, I could chase that.
[12172.36 --> 12174.70]  That's the kind of stuff we don't have to talk about,
[12174.70 --> 12176.38]  but we do.
[12181.88 --> 12182.32]  Yeah.
[12183.26 --> 12183.84]  Next up.
[12184.56 --> 12184.90]  Okay.
[12185.38 --> 12188.04]  I actually have an interjection here from Nick Light
[12188.04 --> 12191.04]  who wanted to remind you that the Gone Fishing t-shirts
[12191.04 --> 12192.58]  will be gone on Monday.
[12192.96 --> 12193.06]  Oh.
[12193.06 --> 12193.62]  Oh.
[12194.14 --> 12194.56]  All right.
[12195.24 --> 12195.48]  Yeah.
[12195.50 --> 12196.52]  If you haven't gotten one,
[12196.66 --> 12197.74]  lttstore.com.
[12198.92 --> 12204.24]  Sarah did an absolutely bang up job of the design for it
[12204.24 --> 12206.14]  with some help from the community.
[12206.14 --> 12209.00]  She did a long, like, five-hour stream
[12209.00 --> 12210.48]  showing the design process,
[12210.56 --> 12211.70]  which is really cool.
[12213.20 --> 12214.26]  Gone Fishing.
[12215.44 --> 12216.52]  Here it is.
[12216.70 --> 12217.04]  Boop.
[12217.50 --> 12218.56]  Super cute.
[12218.72 --> 12219.38]  Still love it.
[12219.38 --> 12221.82]  I will love it forever.
[12222.44 --> 12224.68]  And if you are on Floatplane,
[12225.28 --> 12226.94]  you can go to exclusives.
[12226.98 --> 12227.90]  This is the beta site
[12227.90 --> 12229.40]  with all the filtering and everything
[12229.40 --> 12231.90]  and the stream with...
[12233.04 --> 12235.64]  Why is my two-finger scrolling not working?
[12235.88 --> 12236.90]  What is my computer doing?
[12237.40 --> 12237.70]  Oh, yeah.
[12237.78 --> 12239.50]  No, I just cannot scroll this at all.
[12240.24 --> 12241.90]  Anyway, the stream is here.
[12242.82 --> 12243.40]  Don't worry.
[12243.46 --> 12244.00]  The site's working.
[12245.20 --> 12247.22]  So, yeah, I think it was, like, five hours
[12247.22 --> 12251.00]  and Sarah shows the entire design process for it.
[12251.08 --> 12252.82]  So that's a good reason to subscribe to Floatplane.
[12252.88 --> 12253.80]  Lots of good exclusives.
[12254.24 --> 12254.72]  All right, Dan.
[12254.86 --> 12255.22]  Carry on.
[12256.50 --> 12256.80]  Okay.
[12257.48 --> 12258.24]  Love the show.
[12258.58 --> 12260.26]  Tattoo artist here from Pennsylvania.
[12260.64 --> 12260.80]  Sick.
[12260.80 --> 12263.90]  Just curious if either of you had any tattoos,
[12264.02 --> 12265.70]  if any, that you would like to get.
[12266.40 --> 12267.64]  We're extremely boring people.
[12268.50 --> 12268.96]  It's true.
[12269.28 --> 12269.94]  I have piercings.
[12270.44 --> 12271.36]  You don't even have piercings.
[12271.46 --> 12271.86]  That's true.
[12273.04 --> 12274.86]  I am more boring.
[12275.06 --> 12275.90]  Yeah, I used to...
[12275.90 --> 12276.30]  It was the race.
[12276.46 --> 12277.82]  Well, I used to be...
[12277.82 --> 12280.12]  I had my piercings long before I even met you.
[12280.24 --> 12283.62]  Yeah, you also used to do crazy hair dye stuff and whatnot.
[12284.50 --> 12286.72]  Yeah, I had, like, pink hair, blue hair, green hair,
[12287.02 --> 12288.36]  blonde hair, black hair.
[12288.92 --> 12290.86]  I kind of think, what colors did I not do?
[12290.88 --> 12291.78]  I tried orange once.
[12291.84 --> 12293.24]  It didn't really go very well.
[12293.32 --> 12295.02]  It just faded out to blonde.
[12295.18 --> 12297.06]  It's like, okay, well, I could have just dyed my hair blonde
[12297.06 --> 12298.30]  then saved myself some trouble.
[12298.82 --> 12299.72]  A dye stage.
[12299.72 --> 12304.22]  Yeah, I spray painted my hair gold once,
[12304.52 --> 12307.20]  like, with just actual, like, rattle can spray paint.
[12307.32 --> 12310.02]  Yeah, that's a vibe right there.
[12310.42 --> 12310.66]  Yeah.
[12311.00 --> 12311.72]  I like tattoos.
[12312.48 --> 12313.38]  I'm not against tattoos.
[12313.70 --> 12313.72]  I just...
[12314.60 --> 12316.82]  Every one that I've thought of getting,
[12318.12 --> 12320.92]  I kind of decide this thing where I'm like,
[12321.02 --> 12325.36]  okay, if I still want it in a significant period of time,
[12325.42 --> 12326.34]  like at least a year,
[12326.34 --> 12327.82]  then I'll consider it.
[12327.88 --> 12329.34]  And every single time, I'm like, nah.
[12330.88 --> 12332.30]  So it just hasn't happened.
[12333.54 --> 12335.34]  There's also stuff where, like...
[12336.74 --> 12339.82]  What is it going to be?
[12340.06 --> 12341.88]  The only one that I thought of recently
[12341.88 --> 12344.86]  was Taquito, my bird that passed away.
[12344.98 --> 12347.92]  We have impressions of his, like, feet.
[12348.04 --> 12348.60]  Oh, that'd be cool.
[12348.68 --> 12350.04]  And I'll say about getting them over my shoulder
[12350.04 --> 12350.94]  where he used to stand.
[12351.02 --> 12351.28]  Yeah.
[12352.22 --> 12352.62]  But...
[12352.62 --> 12353.88]  It would just look kind of random, though.
[12354.02 --> 12355.92]  Budgie feet are just wise.
[12355.92 --> 12356.56]  Yeah.
[12356.80 --> 12358.84]  So there would just be two Ys on my shoulder.
[12359.02 --> 12359.32]  Yeah.
[12361.08 --> 12361.44]  Okay.
[12364.62 --> 12366.34]  So it would just look like I have stitches.
[12367.70 --> 12368.06]  Yeah.
[12368.50 --> 12371.84]  Like, I, like, drew it on my shoulder
[12371.84 --> 12373.26]  and was like, yeah, nah.
[12373.62 --> 12374.20]  I don't know.
[12374.42 --> 12376.04]  I can remember him other ways.
[12376.58 --> 12376.90]  I don't know.
[12377.00 --> 12378.28]  I think tattoos look kind of cool,
[12378.28 --> 12379.04]  but it's like,
[12379.04 --> 12382.00]  I would have to actually go out of my way
[12382.00 --> 12386.22]  to do a thing that is, like, body decorating.
[12386.58 --> 12390.24]  I mean, I'm lucky that I have the motivation
[12390.24 --> 12391.96]  to, like, brush my teeth twice a day.
[12392.14 --> 12392.82]  Like, it's...
[12392.82 --> 12395.40]  Like, maintaining my body
[12395.40 --> 12397.48]  is not something that I have traditionally...
[12398.70 --> 12400.66]  Okay, I shouldn't say not maintenance.
[12400.88 --> 12402.94]  Like, I exercise and stuff like that,
[12403.00 --> 12404.34]  but just decorating.
[12404.44 --> 12404.68]  Decorating.
[12404.68 --> 12405.10]  It's different.
[12405.10 --> 12405.46]  Yeah.
[12405.88 --> 12407.62]  Like, all my piercings
[12407.62 --> 12409.32]  are from when I was in my early teens.
[12410.48 --> 12411.32]  Like, I had all...
[12411.32 --> 12412.50]  I had everything that I have,
[12412.58 --> 12413.56]  plus the...
[12413.56 --> 12415.34]  I had one up at the top of the ear.
[12415.42 --> 12416.58]  I had an eyebrow ring,
[12417.04 --> 12418.94]  and I used to, like, dye my hair and stuff.
[12419.00 --> 12420.90]  That's all when I was, like, 13, 14.
[12422.26 --> 12424.14]  And then after that, I just kind of...
[12424.14 --> 12426.20]  I don't even put gel in my hair anymore.
[12426.32 --> 12426.78]  I just...
[12426.78 --> 12428.10]  Just don't.
[12428.82 --> 12431.00]  I haven't in a very long time.
[12431.04 --> 12432.20]  And I gotta tell you,
[12432.40 --> 12433.70]  Yvonne's not super into tattoos,
[12434.02 --> 12434.74]  so that's something.
[12434.74 --> 12435.18]  Okay.
[12435.48 --> 12437.40]  And she's especially not into
[12437.40 --> 12438.78]  the kinds of tattoos
[12438.78 --> 12441.64]  that I've sort of floated with her anyway.
[12442.12 --> 12443.48]  I thought about getting, like,
[12443.52 --> 12444.52]  my employment history,
[12444.76 --> 12445.56]  and she's like,
[12445.80 --> 12446.02]  really?
[12446.74 --> 12447.66]  Not my name?
[12447.74 --> 12448.20]  And I'm like,
[12448.72 --> 12449.62]  I mean...
[12449.62 --> 12451.42]  Partner names is so...
[12451.42 --> 12452.96]  I offered to get wedding rings
[12452.96 --> 12454.18]  in tattoo,
[12454.50 --> 12455.52]  and she didn't want to do it.
[12455.66 --> 12457.06]  I've actually thought that's kind of cool,
[12457.14 --> 12458.14]  because I...
[12458.14 --> 12459.36]  Any form of jewelry,
[12459.54 --> 12460.12]  if I wear it,
[12460.14 --> 12460.92]  it's gonna disappear.
[12461.42 --> 12462.06]  So, like...
[12462.06 --> 12463.56]  This is still my original one.
[12463.56 --> 12464.06]  I'm shocked.
[12464.06 --> 12464.66]  I'm...
[12464.66 --> 12465.28]  Because I take it off
[12465.28 --> 12466.34]  and play with it all the time.
[12466.46 --> 12466.66]  Yeah.
[12467.96 --> 12469.10]  It's amazing to me.
[12473.10 --> 12473.54]  Okay.
[12473.70 --> 12475.14]  Up next is from Alexander.
[12475.72 --> 12476.18]  Hey, Linus,
[12476.24 --> 12477.02]  as a biker,
[12477.24 --> 12478.90]  I have many favorite roads,
[12479.00 --> 12479.74]  my top one being
[12479.74 --> 12481.68]  the Beartooth Pass in Montana.
[12482.10 --> 12482.88]  Are there any roads
[12482.88 --> 12484.24]  that you love to ride?
[12484.66 --> 12484.98]  P.S.
[12484.98 --> 12486.64]  The GF is very happy
[12486.64 --> 12488.20]  about LDT's women's underwear.
[12488.40 --> 12488.84]  Nice.
[12489.00 --> 12489.18]  Cool.
[12489.38 --> 12490.26]  Glad they're a hit.
[12490.34 --> 12491.14]  They're actually selling
[12491.14 --> 12492.12]  shockingly well.
[12492.70 --> 12494.56]  We haven't had, like,
[12495.20 --> 12497.80]  a ton of success
[12497.80 --> 12499.42]  with the women's apparel so far,
[12499.64 --> 12500.72]  just because, you know,
[12500.78 --> 12502.10]  our demo being what it is,
[12502.12 --> 12502.48]  I think.
[12502.80 --> 12504.12]  But the underwear,
[12504.44 --> 12505.98]  for whatever reason...
[12506.84 --> 12507.58]  Way better?
[12507.70 --> 12508.42]  Yeah, way better.
[12508.72 --> 12509.10]  Interesting.
[12509.40 --> 12510.02]  Yeah, go figure.
[12511.14 --> 12512.46]  Any roads you love to ride?
[12512.56 --> 12513.62]  You know, honestly speaking,
[12513.80 --> 12514.92]  I...
[12514.92 --> 12518.82]  Yeah, gotta be careful
[12518.82 --> 12519.46]  with the N-word,
[12519.58 --> 12522.34]  but I never ride for pleasure.
[12523.64 --> 12524.00]  Never.
[12524.68 --> 12525.06]  It's a...
[12525.06 --> 12525.72]  Well, it's a word
[12525.72 --> 12526.62]  that you gotta be careful
[12526.62 --> 12527.46]  about using.
[12527.60 --> 12528.36]  I hate it here.
[12528.62 --> 12529.18]  I hate it.
[12531.02 --> 12533.18]  It's got such a brutal flashback.
[12533.28 --> 12533.72]  Oh, my goodness.
[12533.72 --> 12535.10]  Do I have to ring the bell?
[12535.72 --> 12536.08]  No.
[12537.30 --> 12537.86]  I do,
[12537.94 --> 12538.76]  but I don't want to name them.
[12539.10 --> 12540.72]  Okay.
[12541.08 --> 12541.68]  That's fair.
[12541.94 --> 12542.72]  Yeah, all right.
[12542.80 --> 12544.42]  Yeah, no, I just...
[12544.42 --> 12547.52]  Yeah, I commute on my bike.
[12547.68 --> 12549.48]  I don't just, like, go...
[12549.48 --> 12551.58]  Ivan has been trying to get me
[12551.58 --> 12552.38]  to, like, go ride
[12552.38 --> 12553.16]  the Sea to Sky Highway
[12553.16 --> 12554.02]  with him forever
[12554.02 --> 12555.08]  because he's super into
[12555.08 --> 12556.58]  motorbiking now,
[12556.62 --> 12557.16]  and I'm just like,
[12557.38 --> 12558.44]  dude, when?
[12559.26 --> 12560.76]  When am I gonna just...
[12560.76 --> 12561.94]  It's also, like, really long.
[12561.94 --> 12563.10]  When am I gonna just go
[12563.10 --> 12564.14]  for three hours?
[12564.34 --> 12565.12]  Yeah, exactly.
[12565.20 --> 12565.58]  And anything.
[12565.80 --> 12565.98]  Yeah.
[12566.14 --> 12566.80]  Like, badminton,
[12566.80 --> 12568.10]  what helps a lot
[12568.10 --> 12569.44]  is that it's exercise.
[12570.32 --> 12571.48]  That's the justification.
[12572.22 --> 12573.92]  Just, like, burning gas
[12573.92 --> 12575.84]  is very difficult
[12575.84 --> 12578.06]  to justify for me.
[12578.30 --> 12579.76]  That sounds like a...
[12579.76 --> 12580.18]  Sorry.
[12580.48 --> 12581.48]  You didn't even say this,
[12581.54 --> 12582.70]  but my brain immediately
[12582.70 --> 12583.48]  went to, like,
[12583.48 --> 12585.60]  90s, like,
[12585.64 --> 12586.80]  don't do drugs slogans.
[12587.00 --> 12587.32]  It's like,
[12587.38 --> 12588.14]  don't burn gas,
[12588.24 --> 12588.92]  burn calories.
[12591.26 --> 12591.88]  Because you're like,
[12591.94 --> 12592.84]  badminton, yeah.
[12592.98 --> 12594.44]  I'm so boring, Luke.
[12597.48 --> 12598.16]  That's okay.
[12598.42 --> 12599.58]  We don't have to be that,
[12600.26 --> 12600.64]  you know.
[12600.82 --> 12601.40]  I don't know.
[12602.36 --> 12602.68]  Yeah.
[12602.86 --> 12603.54]  We've been over it
[12603.54 --> 12604.12]  a bunch of times,
[12604.18 --> 12604.96]  but neither of us drink,
[12605.22 --> 12605.98]  neither of us smoke,
[12606.38 --> 12607.30]  neither of us do any drugs.
[12607.86 --> 12608.60]  We don't have tattoos.
[12609.32 --> 12610.32]  I gambled on crypto
[12610.32 --> 12610.98]  that one time.
[12611.06 --> 12611.46]  It was bad.
[12611.74 --> 12612.40]  So I'm over it.
[12614.44 --> 12614.84]  Yep.
[12615.30 --> 12615.94]  Well, at least you have
[12615.94 --> 12616.86]  vibrant lives
[12616.86 --> 12617.80]  outside of work.
[12618.32 --> 12618.64]  Yeah.
[12618.98 --> 12620.70]  Okay, up next is from John.
[12621.70 --> 12623.02]  Up next is from John.
[12623.56 --> 12624.00]  Linus,
[12624.06 --> 12624.50]  do you still have
[12624.50 --> 12625.86]  that old aluminum case
[12625.86 --> 12627.06]  in a UV shrine?
[12628.94 --> 12629.38]  No.
[12629.58 --> 12630.20]  Aluminum case.
[12630.44 --> 12631.56]  No, I sold it
[12631.56 --> 12632.86]  back when I got my TJ07.
[12633.20 --> 12633.68]  Oh, yeah.
[12635.18 --> 12636.22]  Next up is from Noah.
[12636.22 --> 12637.70]  Hey, two merch message
[12637.70 --> 12638.86]  questions, suggestions.
[12638.96 --> 12639.84]  Actually, hold on one second.
[12639.90 --> 12640.22]  Oh, no.
[12640.34 --> 12640.90]  You know, it's funny.
[12641.44 --> 12643.10]  I, yeah, you know what?
[12643.12 --> 12644.06]  I remember it being
[12644.06 --> 12645.12]  hard to part with, though.
[12645.86 --> 12646.62]  Even though I was
[12646.62 --> 12647.98]  constantly flipping stuff
[12647.98 --> 12648.52]  back then,
[12648.66 --> 12651.60]  I had put so much work
[12651.60 --> 12652.92]  into that case
[12652.92 --> 12654.60]  that I didn't want
[12654.60 --> 12655.16]  to get rid of it,
[12655.22 --> 12655.82]  but realistically,
[12655.98 --> 12656.76]  my wife gave me one
[12656.76 --> 12657.80]  that was so much better
[12657.80 --> 12658.64]  and from her
[12658.64 --> 12660.94]  that I was never
[12660.94 --> 12661.84]  going to use it again,
[12662.24 --> 12663.32]  and so I did eventually
[12663.32 --> 12663.96]  part with it,
[12664.04 --> 12664.92]  but it made me think,
[12664.92 --> 12667.16]  I have only had
[12667.16 --> 12668.30]  in my,
[12669.16 --> 12670.94]  since I was 17
[12670.94 --> 12672.80]  and built my first computer,
[12672.94 --> 12673.90]  so in 20 years,
[12674.24 --> 12675.58]  I have only had
[12675.58 --> 12676.62]  four cases.
[12678.28 --> 12679.54]  The first one lasted,
[12679.84 --> 12680.04]  I think,
[12680.14 --> 12680.98]  less than a year.
[12681.40 --> 12682.82]  It was an Antec Landboy.
[12683.60 --> 12684.84]  The second one
[12684.84 --> 12685.48]  lasted,
[12685.88 --> 12687.54]  like, a few years.
[12687.60 --> 12688.38]  You guys saw it
[12688.38 --> 12689.30]  in its various
[12689.30 --> 12691.44]  forms
[12691.44 --> 12692.92]  in that video recently.
[12693.06 --> 12693.82]  Then I had the TJ07,
[12693.82 --> 12694.72]  and then now I have
[12694.72 --> 12695.28]  my RackMap one.
[12695.44 --> 12696.02]  That's it.
[12696.84 --> 12697.70]  That's the whole thing.
[12698.58 --> 12699.74]  I don't change cases.
[12700.52 --> 12700.64]  Like,
[12700.70 --> 12701.94]  PC of Theseus
[12701.94 --> 12702.48]  kind of thing.
[12702.64 --> 12704.10]  Just change all the stuff.
[12704.48 --> 12704.50]  I also think,
[12704.50 --> 12706.36]  in something that I get
[12706.36 --> 12707.28]  flamed for all the time,
[12707.46 --> 12708.52]  but you also are,
[12709.52 --> 12710.82]  is you could also
[12710.82 --> 12711.78]  look at the cars,
[12711.98 --> 12712.64]  the amount of cars
[12712.64 --> 12713.04]  you've had.
[12714.32 --> 12714.72]  Yeah.
[12714.86 --> 12715.86]  We're both a little cheap.
[12716.36 --> 12716.70]  Yes.
[12717.90 --> 12719.14]  A case does not make
[12719.14 --> 12720.26]  the computer more faster,
[12720.38 --> 12720.50]  right?
[12720.50 --> 12721.24]  So you don't need
[12721.24 --> 12721.92]  to get a new one
[12721.92 --> 12722.54]  every time.
[12725.92 --> 12727.02]  I'm sure there's probably
[12727.02 --> 12728.02]  somewhat similar things
[12728.02 --> 12728.78]  with power supplies.
[12728.88 --> 12729.34]  You probably carried
[12729.34 --> 12730.32]  power supplies between
[12730.32 --> 12731.82]  builds from time to time.
[12732.06 --> 12732.38]  No,
[12732.50 --> 12733.80]  I was into, like,
[12734.40 --> 12735.70]  having a good power supply,
[12735.88 --> 12736.44]  for sure.
[12736.56 --> 12736.70]  I mean,
[12736.72 --> 12738.66]  that's a fair...
[12738.66 --> 12739.52]  And power supplies
[12739.52 --> 12740.80]  were advancing really fast
[12740.80 --> 12741.38]  for a bit there.
[12741.38 --> 12741.68]  That's also true.
[12741.80 --> 12742.38]  And there were, like,
[12742.46 --> 12743.04]  new connectors
[12743.04 --> 12744.16]  on the graphics cards
[12744.16 --> 12745.32]  that you didn't, like,
[12745.38 --> 12746.60]  really want to plug
[12746.60 --> 12747.74]  the two Molexes in.
[12748.54 --> 12749.38]  And they weren't
[12749.38 --> 12750.52]  modular yet.
[12750.86 --> 12751.52]  You couldn't get
[12751.52 --> 12752.32]  third-party cables
[12752.32 --> 12753.08]  for them.
[12753.54 --> 12754.28]  Okay, I guess there
[12754.28 --> 12754.84]  was a bunch of...
[12754.84 --> 12755.38]  Yeah, I upgraded
[12755.38 --> 12756.04]  my power supplies
[12756.04 --> 12757.00]  a fair bit
[12757.00 --> 12758.54]  compared to cases.
[12758.86 --> 12759.54]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12760.30 --> 12761.14]  Just trying to think.
[12761.18 --> 12762.04]  Yeah, all the cars
[12762.04 --> 12762.64]  I've ever owned.
[12762.72 --> 12763.80]  So my parents got me
[12763.80 --> 12764.88]  a 91 Jetta.
[12766.60 --> 12768.00]  And that wasn't
[12768.00 --> 12768.60]  a freebie.
[12768.68 --> 12769.48]  The deal was that
[12769.48 --> 12770.44]  I drove all my siblings
[12770.44 --> 12771.40]  to anywhere they needed
[12771.40 --> 12771.76]  to go.
[12771.76 --> 12773.00]  I had four siblings.
[12773.68 --> 12774.86]  And we lived in the middle
[12774.86 --> 12776.20]  of butt-f***ing nowhere.
[12776.40 --> 12777.06]  So each one of those drives
[12777.06 --> 12777.52]  is low.
[12777.84 --> 12780.60]  So it was 17 minutes
[12780.60 --> 12781.34]  to anywhere.
[12781.44 --> 12781.94]  Did you have to pay
[12781.94 --> 12782.44]  for the gas
[12782.44 --> 12783.02]  for those drives?
[12784.36 --> 12785.28]  I don't think my parents
[12785.28 --> 12786.04]  gave me gas money.
[12786.30 --> 12787.60]  Gas was a lot less expensive
[12787.60 --> 12788.14]  back then, though.
[12788.16 --> 12789.24]  That's true, but still...
[12789.24 --> 12790.04]  And it was diesel,
[12790.50 --> 12792.70]  which was less expensive.
[12793.42 --> 12795.16]  Man, when I got my Civic...
[12795.16 --> 12796.22]  So then my next car
[12796.22 --> 12796.80]  was my Civic.
[12797.08 --> 12798.18]  When I got the Civic,
[12798.80 --> 12799.58]  I was, like,
[12800.64 --> 12801.30]  aghast.
[12802.26 --> 12802.64]  How...
[12802.64 --> 12804.70]  How much I was spending
[12804.70 --> 12805.26]  on fuel.
[12805.60 --> 12805.82]  Yeah.
[12806.08 --> 12806.98]  Because even...
[12806.98 --> 12808.00]  Thanks for that.
[12808.42 --> 12809.38]  Because even though
[12809.38 --> 12810.92]  it's an efficient car
[12810.92 --> 12811.58]  or whatever,
[12812.06 --> 12812.82]  a gas car,
[12813.20 --> 12814.50]  compared to my diesel,
[12814.60 --> 12815.64]  I just assumed
[12815.64 --> 12816.34]  I was getting...
[12816.34 --> 12817.24]  Like, I didn't realize
[12817.24 --> 12817.98]  what the difference was.
[12818.02 --> 12818.68]  I'm not a car guy.
[12818.88 --> 12819.98]  And I believe
[12819.98 --> 12820.62]  you were saying
[12820.62 --> 12821.44]  effectively this,
[12821.50 --> 12822.10]  but just to make it
[12822.10 --> 12822.82]  more straightforward,
[12823.38 --> 12824.70]  the gap in price
[12824.70 --> 12826.00]  between diesel and gas
[12826.00 --> 12827.50]  was more back then, right?
[12827.50 --> 12828.90]  It was more initially.
[12829.08 --> 12830.32]  By the time I got the Civic,
[12830.42 --> 12831.38]  the gap wasn't as much.
[12831.38 --> 12831.70]  Okay.
[12831.76 --> 12832.68]  So I assumed
[12832.68 --> 12835.70]  that the fuel economy,
[12835.90 --> 12836.98]  like how many liters
[12836.98 --> 12837.98]  per 100 kilometers
[12837.98 --> 12838.40]  or whatever,
[12838.52 --> 12839.10]  was similar.
[12839.30 --> 12839.92]  Because I didn't really,
[12839.92 --> 12841.02]  like, look that closely at it.
[12841.06 --> 12841.80]  And then I didn't realize
[12841.80 --> 12842.52]  until I got the Civic,
[12842.58 --> 12842.94]  I said, wow,
[12842.98 --> 12843.96]  I'm filling this thing up a lot.
[12844.62 --> 12845.52]  I didn't realize
[12845.52 --> 12846.66]  how far off it was.
[12846.80 --> 12848.28]  Like, why isn't every car diesel?
[12848.36 --> 12849.04]  This is stupid.
[12850.96 --> 12852.04]  Yeah, then I got the Volt
[12852.04 --> 12852.82]  and then the Taycan.
[12853.58 --> 12854.10]  That's it.
[12854.14 --> 12854.58]  Four cars.
[12856.22 --> 12856.44]  Yeah.
[12856.44 --> 12857.08]  Yeah.
[12857.70 --> 12858.34]  And like,
[12858.42 --> 12859.66]  that feels like a lot to me,
[12859.74 --> 12861.00]  to be perfectly honest with you.
[12861.40 --> 12862.98]  It feels extravagant.
[12863.12 --> 12863.48]  But then...
[12863.48 --> 12864.48]  I don't think statistically
[12864.48 --> 12865.14]  it's that much.
[12865.16 --> 12866.26]  I see people
[12866.26 --> 12868.94]  that change their car a lot.
[12869.22 --> 12869.46]  Yeah.
[12869.56 --> 12871.14]  I'm like, oh, interesting.
[12871.90 --> 12872.54]  That...
[12872.54 --> 12872.98]  Huh.
[12873.66 --> 12874.16]  And like,
[12874.76 --> 12876.02]  and sometimes they'll go from
[12876.02 --> 12878.14]  a new car to a new car.
[12878.14 --> 12881.24]  And in my mind,
[12881.34 --> 12883.52]  not only did they buy a new car
[12883.52 --> 12884.84]  and buy a new car,
[12884.96 --> 12886.08]  but I feel like that one
[12886.08 --> 12886.78]  was still new.
[12886.92 --> 12887.28]  Yeah.
[12887.46 --> 12887.86]  Sometimes.
[12888.08 --> 12888.52]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12888.62 --> 12889.44]  I'm just like, oh, okay.
[12890.08 --> 12890.30]  Yeah.
[12890.66 --> 12892.24]  I do still win
[12892.24 --> 12893.50]  because I've only had two.
[12895.48 --> 12895.92]  Yeah.
[12896.00 --> 12896.94]  The Sunfire
[12896.94 --> 12899.60]  and the other one.
[12899.88 --> 12900.14]  Yep.
[12901.34 --> 12902.32]  All right, well, you win.
[12902.46 --> 12902.92]  That's it.
[12903.48 --> 12906.40]  I think you're gonna get
[12906.40 --> 12907.08]  something cool
[12907.08 --> 12908.44]  maybe in the next couple years.
[12908.52 --> 12909.24]  I'd be surprised.
[12910.00 --> 12910.86]  I'd be surprised.
[12911.02 --> 12912.00]  The economy of it
[12912.00 --> 12913.30]  is gonna have to make sense.
[12913.48 --> 12913.80]  Well, yeah,
[12913.86 --> 12915.20]  but I think that's gonna come though.
[12915.38 --> 12915.56]  Yeah.
[12915.80 --> 12916.24]  Like...
[12916.24 --> 12916.80]  If that happens,
[12916.92 --> 12917.54]  for sure.
[12917.62 --> 12918.40]  I think it's gonna be hard
[12918.40 --> 12919.82]  for you to resist the free charging.
[12920.30 --> 12920.60]  Yeah.
[12920.72 --> 12921.36]  In the long term.
[12921.50 --> 12922.52]  That is definitely
[12922.52 --> 12924.18]  like playing into the equation.
[12924.34 --> 12927.14]  As prices of used EVs come down,
[12928.46 --> 12929.56]  keep your eye on
[12929.56 --> 12931.18]  the provincial PST exemption
[12931.18 --> 12932.30]  for used EVs
[12932.30 --> 12933.90]  because that's a big deal.
[12934.12 --> 12935.46]  You'll have to wait a lot longer
[12935.46 --> 12936.88]  if that exemption goes away
[12936.88 --> 12938.38]  to get the same deal
[12938.38 --> 12939.46]  as you would get now
[12939.46 --> 12939.94]  kind of thing.
[12940.14 --> 12940.30]  Yeah.
[12940.30 --> 12941.40]  Just keep an eye on it.
[12941.48 --> 12941.60]  Yeah.
[12941.66 --> 12942.06]  That's all.
[12942.70 --> 12943.52]  That's all.
[12944.08 --> 12945.30]  Hey, Whiskey Nerd 88,
[12945.48 --> 12947.50]  1999 Sunfire Gang.
[12948.14 --> 12949.08]  What year was yours?
[12949.56 --> 12950.00]  1990.
[12951.06 --> 12951.46]  1990?
[12951.90 --> 12952.10]  Yeah.
[12952.24 --> 12952.56]  Nice.
[12952.80 --> 12953.62]  Well, I bought it
[12953.62 --> 12956.92]  like not even that long after,
[12957.08 --> 12958.88]  like seven years after 1999.
[12959.38 --> 12960.32]  So like it would have been
[12960.32 --> 12961.78]  not even that old of a car.
[12961.86 --> 12962.16]  It would have been
[12962.16 --> 12962.98]  a lot more expensive
[12962.98 --> 12963.76]  at that point.
[12963.92 --> 12964.92]  I bought it for two grand.
[12964.92 --> 12966.00]  It was actually like
[12966.00 --> 12967.34]  a really good deal.
[12967.54 --> 12967.76]  Yeah.
[12968.12 --> 12968.36]  Yeah.
[12970.48 --> 12971.48]  We knew you'd win.
[12971.56 --> 12972.26]  We all know you are
[12972.26 --> 12973.24]  cheaper than Linus.
[12973.48 --> 12974.46]  He is cheap though.
[12974.64 --> 12975.20]  Like it's not.
[12975.64 --> 12977.30]  About surprising things.
[12977.96 --> 12978.26]  Yeah.
[12980.26 --> 12980.70]  Yeah.
[12980.94 --> 12981.16]  Yeah.
[12981.20 --> 12981.88]  Like I will,
[12982.04 --> 12984.78]  I will spend shocking amounts
[12984.78 --> 12986.26]  of money on some things.
[12987.50 --> 12989.62]  Luke is very upset
[12989.62 --> 12990.90]  about how much
[12990.90 --> 12991.78]  I'm apparently willing
[12991.78 --> 12992.82]  to throw in a fire
[12992.82 --> 12995.78]  to build an automatic
[12995.78 --> 12997.18]  scoring system
[12997.18 --> 12999.28]  in the badminton gym
[12999.28 --> 13000.38]  that I'm building.
[13002.16 --> 13003.06]  Very upset.
[13003.18 --> 13004.08]  It's a little nuts.
[13004.78 --> 13005.68]  It sounds fun.
[13005.68 --> 13006.42]  I am admitting,
[13006.42 --> 13007.94]  I am admitting,
[13008.12 --> 13009.02]  I am admitting
[13009.02 --> 13009.90]  that it sounds fun,
[13009.98 --> 13011.20]  but it's like
[13011.20 --> 13013.86]  kind of nuts.
[13014.74 --> 13015.86]  I, there is,
[13015.98 --> 13016.88]  I know there's a word
[13016.88 --> 13018.12]  for what it is.
[13021.78 --> 13022.22]  Don't.
[13022.30 --> 13023.58]  I escaped me right now.
[13023.76 --> 13024.04]  Don't.
[13024.96 --> 13026.08]  What was I going to say?
[13026.66 --> 13027.80]  Man, that totally
[13027.80 --> 13029.12]  threw me completely off.
[13030.04 --> 13030.48]  Oh, right.
[13030.72 --> 13031.00]  Can it,
[13031.06 --> 13032.22]  are we saying what it,
[13032.40 --> 13032.86]  so we're just saying
[13032.86 --> 13033.82]  automated scoring system?
[13034.52 --> 13034.92]  Yeah.
[13035.02 --> 13035.60]  Well, I mean,
[13035.60 --> 13036.66]  we can talk more about it.
[13036.80 --> 13036.90]  I don't care.
[13036.90 --> 13037.42]  There is,
[13037.52 --> 13039.42]  there is ways
[13039.42 --> 13040.62]  to monetize it.
[13040.78 --> 13041.88]  It's just not
[13041.88 --> 13043.16]  a system of monetization
[13043.16 --> 13044.84]  that I,
[13045.10 --> 13046.18]  probably anyone here
[13046.18 --> 13046.96]  has ever done.
[13047.32 --> 13047.58]  No.
[13047.58 --> 13047.86]  And like,
[13047.92 --> 13048.98]  are we going to do it?
[13049.00 --> 13049.44]  Probably not.
[13049.50 --> 13050.24]  I feel like no.
[13050.48 --> 13050.98]  Yeah, I know.
[13051.76 --> 13052.48]  Because there's like
[13052.48 --> 13053.60]  probably more profitable
[13053.60 --> 13054.62]  things that we could work on.
[13054.72 --> 13054.96]  Oh, yeah.
[13055.48 --> 13056.30]  Yeah, so it's like,
[13056.54 --> 13057.62]  we're not going to try
[13057.62 --> 13058.82]  to monetize it properly.
[13059.16 --> 13059.36]  No.
[13059.62 --> 13059.98]  So,
[13060.22 --> 13062.82]  but it'll be really cool.
[13062.88 --> 13063.94]  It's going to be pretty cool.
[13064.36 --> 13064.84]  You're, okay,
[13064.90 --> 13065.66]  your argument about
[13065.66 --> 13066.58]  getting videos out of it,
[13066.58 --> 13067.50]  I don't think is legitimate.
[13067.56 --> 13068.70]  I'm going to get videos out of it.
[13068.72 --> 13069.18]  How many?
[13070.12 --> 13070.48]  Some.
[13071.12 --> 13071.58]  Not many.
[13071.92 --> 13072.20]  Two?
[13072.78 --> 13074.32]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[13074.42 --> 13075.28]  Because you got to remember.
[13075.44 --> 13076.54]  Because you can't saturate
[13076.54 --> 13077.92]  the audience with badminton videos.
[13078.02 --> 13078.60]  No, but they're not
[13078.60 --> 13079.48]  badminton videos.
[13080.12 --> 13080.66]  When we,
[13080.72 --> 13081.88]  when we build like
[13081.88 --> 13083.72]  a machine vision system
[13083.72 --> 13085.62]  to track the shuttle
[13085.62 --> 13086.38]  or whatever,
[13087.06 --> 13089.06]  there'll be a video
[13089.06 --> 13090.66]  about like the hardware setup.
[13091.42 --> 13091.86]  What?
[13092.06 --> 13092.78]  The acronym.
[13093.28 --> 13094.22]  Did you do that on purpose?
[13095.70 --> 13096.14]  No.
[13096.14 --> 13097.36]  Automated scoring system?
[13098.80 --> 13100.68]  No, but we have to call it that.
[13102.54 --> 13104.24]  We definitely have to call it that.
[13104.24 --> 13104.62]  No one in,
[13104.68 --> 13105.28]  that was,
[13105.36 --> 13106.00]  I didn't notice that.
[13106.04 --> 13106.88]  Someone in Flowplane chat
[13106.88 --> 13107.54]  pointed that out.
[13108.28 --> 13108.56]  Okay.
[13109.04 --> 13109.24]  So,
[13109.48 --> 13111.48]  when I make a video
[13111.48 --> 13112.46]  about my ass,
[13112.56 --> 13115.68]  you guys will watch it.
[13115.68 --> 13116.92]  No strawberry this time.
[13117.00 --> 13117.48]  No strawberry.
[13117.48 --> 13118.62]  Okay.
[13118.62 --> 13120.78]  And then we do a follow-up video
[13120.78 --> 13122.00]  on the like,
[13122.48 --> 13122.94]  the,
[13122.94 --> 13123.28]  the,
[13123.28 --> 13124.06]  the machine,
[13124.28 --> 13125.28]  the machine vision,
[13125.28 --> 13125.90]  like,
[13126.02 --> 13128.12]  GPU setup in the rack
[13128.12 --> 13129.30]  that powers,
[13129.56 --> 13129.86]  you know,
[13129.92 --> 13131.22]  all the quarks or whatever.
[13131.36 --> 13132.70]  I can definitely think of like,
[13133.02 --> 13134.28]  maybe an introduction
[13134.28 --> 13136.04]  to the project video
[13136.04 --> 13138.16]  where you talk about capabilities
[13138.16 --> 13138.62]  and like,
[13138.70 --> 13139.60]  what our plan is
[13139.60 --> 13140.32]  and show the hardware
[13140.32 --> 13141.06]  for the plan
[13141.06 --> 13141.66]  and all that kind of stuff.
[13141.66 --> 13142.52]  And then like,
[13142.92 --> 13144.28]  first major milestone.
[13144.80 --> 13145.06]  Yeah.
[13145.24 --> 13146.18]  And then completion.
[13146.82 --> 13147.26]  No, no, no.
[13147.32 --> 13147.56]  There's,
[13147.62 --> 13147.86]  oh no,
[13147.90 --> 13148.88]  there's lots of stuff in between.
[13148.96 --> 13149.14]  Okay.
[13149.40 --> 13149.80]  So,
[13149.96 --> 13151.30]  what about the other cameras
[13151.30 --> 13152.68]  that are going to be on every court?
[13152.82 --> 13154.10]  We could make a system about like,
[13154.14 --> 13155.92]  how do you build the ultimate OBS,
[13156.42 --> 13156.70]  like,
[13156.88 --> 13157.28]  monster?
[13158.14 --> 13159.50]  How many people watch OBS content?
[13160.56 --> 13160.80]  Yeah,
[13160.80 --> 13162.02]  but I can title it in a way.
[13162.08 --> 13162.26]  People,
[13162.42 --> 13162.64]  they'll,
[13162.64 --> 13163.72]  they'll f***ing watch it.
[13164.76 --> 13165.60]  They'll watch it.
[13167.16 --> 13167.68]  All right.
[13167.74 --> 13167.88]  So,
[13167.94 --> 13168.76]  we build this like,
[13169.12 --> 13170.62]  monstrous OBS machine
[13170.62 --> 13172.30]  that can handle ingest
[13172.30 --> 13172.98]  from like,
[13173.34 --> 13175.74]  14 simultaneous streams
[13175.74 --> 13177.26]  and we like,
[13177.32 --> 13178.18]  cobble it together
[13178.18 --> 13178.98]  with like,
[13179.38 --> 13181.26]  firmware hacked G-Force cards
[13181.26 --> 13182.52]  so that you can overcome
[13182.52 --> 13182.88]  the,
[13182.88 --> 13184.66]  the NVENC encoding limit
[13184.66 --> 13185.02]  or whatever.
[13185.16 --> 13185.30]  Like,
[13185.54 --> 13186.42]  that's content.
[13186.88 --> 13187.22]  I see,
[13187.34 --> 13188.02]  that's content.
[13188.52 --> 13189.32]  My problem is,
[13189.52 --> 13189.90]  there's,
[13190.00 --> 13190.92]  there's no like,
[13191.58 --> 13192.88]  I talked to Yvonne about it
[13192.88 --> 13193.86]  and she was,
[13194.26 --> 13194.90]  she was like,
[13194.96 --> 13196.68]  asking me questions about like,
[13197.48 --> 13197.70]  like,
[13197.70 --> 13198.94]  do you think it's worth it?
[13199.06 --> 13199.62]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[13199.72 --> 13200.50]  She's asking things
[13200.50 --> 13200.96]  about like,
[13201.12 --> 13202.10]  my opinion on it.
[13202.22 --> 13202.68]  And I'm like,
[13202.88 --> 13203.02]  no,
[13203.14 --> 13203.56]  I can't,
[13203.60 --> 13203.74]  like,
[13203.80 --> 13204.18]  there's no,
[13204.96 --> 13205.14]  like,
[13205.16 --> 13205.92]  I can't sit here
[13205.92 --> 13206.88]  and argue with him
[13206.88 --> 13210.08]  about the efficacy
[13210.08 --> 13212.98]  because he just wants it.
[13215.46 --> 13216.20]  And like,
[13216.28 --> 13218.28]  he wants it to be really good.
[13218.80 --> 13220.00]  So it's gonna like,
[13220.22 --> 13220.60]  you know,
[13220.64 --> 13220.96]  the whole,
[13221.06 --> 13221.38]  the,
[13221.38 --> 13221.50]  the,
[13221.50 --> 13222.94]  the quality cheap,
[13223.06 --> 13223.30]  whatever.
[13223.72 --> 13223.94]  Cheap.
[13224.02 --> 13224.18]  Yeah.
[13224.18 --> 13224.82]  The triangle.
[13224.82 --> 13225.34]  Like,
[13225.38 --> 13226.66]  he wants it to be really good.
[13227.90 --> 13231.02]  He doesn't care that much about fast.
[13233.04 --> 13233.74]  But like,
[13233.78 --> 13235.12]  he wants it to be really good.
[13235.44 --> 13236.20]  And he wants,
[13236.26 --> 13238.36]  and he's definitely gonna want it to exist.
[13238.58 --> 13240.60]  The amount of care that he seems to have
[13240.60 --> 13242.52]  about it being able to be profitable,
[13242.84 --> 13244.28]  it making sense,
[13244.48 --> 13245.44]  all this other kind of stuff
[13245.44 --> 13246.52]  is super low.
[13246.66 --> 13248.64]  I love that you guys have meetings about me.
[13248.90 --> 13250.06]  You told me to.
[13250.60 --> 13250.84]  Well,
[13251.02 --> 13251.36]  okay,
[13251.44 --> 13251.70]  what I,
[13251.84 --> 13252.74]  what you said was,
[13252.82 --> 13254.72]  am I good to post the job posting?
[13255.16 --> 13255.82]  And I said,
[13255.88 --> 13255.98]  well,
[13256.02 --> 13256.38]  those had,
[13256.46 --> 13257.56]  that has to be cleared by Yvonne.
[13257.80 --> 13258.08]  Yeah.
[13258.32 --> 13258.56]  Yeah.
[13260.16 --> 13261.28]  So what am I supposed to do?
[13261.48 --> 13262.68]  I have to have a meeting with Yvonne.
[13263.58 --> 13264.34]  But like,
[13264.44 --> 13264.60]  yeah,
[13264.66 --> 13266.22]  there's no argument that I can make
[13266.22 --> 13267.80]  that's gonna change his mind.
[13267.80 --> 13268.10]  Because like,
[13268.16 --> 13268.42]  what am I,
[13268.42 --> 13269.54]  what am I gonna debate him on?
[13269.86 --> 13270.02]  Yeah.
[13270.16 --> 13270.80]  Nerdim says,
[13270.80 --> 13272.74]  if I got a hundred thousand dollar gold controller
[13272.74 --> 13273.32]  past Yvonne,
[13273.40 --> 13275.00]  I can get a badminton scoring system.
[13275.12 --> 13275.28]  Yeah.
[13275.38 --> 13275.54]  Like,
[13275.62 --> 13278.10]  I mean,
[13278.14 --> 13279.04]  she's very sensible
[13279.04 --> 13279.80]  and she's like,
[13279.80 --> 13280.28]  she's great.
[13280.36 --> 13281.38]  She'll make sure that I don't,
[13281.38 --> 13281.68]  you know,
[13281.76 --> 13283.66]  lead us into financial ruin or whatever,
[13283.66 --> 13284.84]  but I wouldn't do that anyway.
[13285.46 --> 13288.80]  And she pretty much lets me do things
[13288.80 --> 13289.38]  if they're,
[13290.60 --> 13291.06]  well,
[13291.10 --> 13292.02]  this is pretty stupid.
[13293.10 --> 13293.86]  I was going to say,
[13293.90 --> 13295.10]  if they're not completely stupid,
[13295.10 --> 13296.88]  but I think this is completely stupid,
[13296.88 --> 13297.52]  but I'm like,
[13297.52 --> 13298.84]  I'm really passionate about the sport,
[13298.94 --> 13299.06]  right?
[13299.06 --> 13299.40]  It's not,
[13299.40 --> 13301.22]  it's not,
[13301.22 --> 13302.04]  not cool.
[13302.32 --> 13302.54]  Yeah.
[13302.58 --> 13303.28]  It's super cool.
[13303.32 --> 13304.14]  It's super cool.
[13304.36 --> 13304.50]  Yeah.
[13304.78 --> 13305.46]  It just like,
[13305.62 --> 13307.18]  and then we'll make a video when we upgrade it.
[13307.50 --> 13308.44]  It just does like,
[13308.44 --> 13309.88]  doesn't make a lot of sense.
[13310.18 --> 13310.30]  Yeah.
[13310.30 --> 13312.02]  And I don't mean sense in regards to like,
[13312.08 --> 13312.52]  like it's,
[13312.60 --> 13313.92]  it seems to be feasible.
[13314.38 --> 13316.10]  That's not the sense I'm talking about.
[13316.26 --> 13316.82]  I mean,
[13316.82 --> 13321.32]  like financially or pretty much any other way.
[13321.36 --> 13322.76]  It's just fun and cool.
[13323.12 --> 13323.38]  Yeah.
[13323.56 --> 13324.04]  I mean,
[13324.04 --> 13325.34]  isn't that the whole idea here?
[13325.46 --> 13326.72]  And that's fine.
[13326.94 --> 13327.28]  Yeah.
[13327.28 --> 13327.80]  My,
[13327.80 --> 13333.12]  my biggest thing when I was talking to Yvonne about it and when I was talking to you about it is just,
[13333.24 --> 13335.28]  you need to be super aware of that.
[13335.88 --> 13340.00]  If you're completely okay with the idea that is just fun and cool,
[13340.00 --> 13344.24]  and this is not going to make any money and it doesn't make any sense in any other way,
[13344.24 --> 13345.62]  then I don't care.
[13345.70 --> 13345.82]  Yeah,
[13345.84 --> 13346.16]  let's do it.
[13346.20 --> 13346.44]  Whatever.
[13346.76 --> 13347.58]  It doesn't matter to me.
[13347.94 --> 13348.28]  Nice.
[13348.56 --> 13348.82]  Yeah.
[13348.98 --> 13349.24]  Okay.
[13349.26 --> 13350.46]  So then let's talk about the scope.
[13350.80 --> 13354.90]  The minimum viable product is that with user intervention.
[13354.90 --> 13358.32]  So with user confirmations and prompts and,
[13358.48 --> 13359.74]  or maybe gestures,
[13359.74 --> 13361.28]  like there's certain things that are going to be tough,
[13361.32 --> 13362.60]  like how to start the game.
[13362.76 --> 13364.60]  Everyone might have to like go like this or something.
[13364.68 --> 13368.94]  And serving because you were pointing out like sometimes a point might be scored,
[13369.08 --> 13372.24]  but then the person might just like hit it back.
[13373.00 --> 13374.54]  And somebody countered to me like,
[13374.64 --> 13374.80]  okay,
[13374.82 --> 13376.76]  but the system would know the rules of the game.
[13376.76 --> 13378.78]  So they would know that that person wasn't supposed to serve.
[13378.78 --> 13379.70]  As long as our,
[13379.70 --> 13383.02]  as long as our tracking system for where it lands is perfect.
[13383.02 --> 13386.48]  And as long as the humans don't disagree with it and decide the score is
[13386.48 --> 13386.90]  something else.
[13386.90 --> 13388.42]  And as long as the humans don't screw up,
[13388.52 --> 13392.76]  maybe they hit it back and they were supposed to serve because they thought
[13392.76 --> 13393.94]  the other side was supposed to serve.
[13394.06 --> 13394.62]  Which happens.
[13394.84 --> 13395.04]  Yeah.
[13395.26 --> 13395.46]  Oh,
[13395.52 --> 13395.84]  sorry.
[13395.92 --> 13396.12]  That was,
[13396.28 --> 13397.12]  that was my point.
[13397.24 --> 13399.24]  So I can pretty much guarantee I have done that.
[13399.34 --> 13399.50]  Like,
[13399.70 --> 13400.44]  so that's it.
[13401.84 --> 13402.76]  There's a lot of,
[13402.80 --> 13404.40]  there's a lot of edge cases and issues.
[13404.40 --> 13405.60]  So we have a bunch of ideas.
[13405.60 --> 13409.44]  Like one of them is having a tablet or I have actually kind of changed the
[13409.44 --> 13411.28]  scale of that for the testing court.
[13411.28 --> 13415.02]  I want it to be a TV because I want it to be like impossible to ignore.
[13415.80 --> 13416.16]  Basically.
[13416.30 --> 13418.08]  I don't want like a small little thing going on.
[13418.16 --> 13420.02]  And I think you should be able to read it from far away.
[13420.14 --> 13420.30]  Oh,
[13420.40 --> 13425.16]  I should have clarified every court is going to have two TVs so that both
[13425.16 --> 13426.24]  sides can see it easily.
[13427.00 --> 13427.32]  Yeah.
[13427.36 --> 13427.48]  No,
[13427.50 --> 13429.30]  the tablet is just to interact with it.
[13429.44 --> 13429.68]  Okay.
[13429.76 --> 13429.96]  Sweet.
[13430.02 --> 13430.14]  Yeah.
[13430.14 --> 13430.38]  Perfect.
[13430.48 --> 13430.60]  Yeah.
[13430.60 --> 13431.52]  We're on the same page there.
[13431.60 --> 13431.80]  Nice.
[13431.98 --> 13432.12]  Yeah.
[13432.30 --> 13433.48]  And then like a,
[13433.48 --> 13435.40]  a like shrouded light thing.
[13435.58 --> 13438.00]  So if it needs to give a notification or if,
[13438.06 --> 13441.18]  if there's something that like you need to address this now,
[13441.18 --> 13444.04]  one of those x-ray machine ones with the green,
[13444.14 --> 13445.10]  yellow and red stripe.
[13445.14 --> 13445.52]  Basically.
[13445.62 --> 13445.80]  Yeah.
[13445.90 --> 13446.06]  Yeah.
[13446.06 --> 13446.40]  So like,
[13446.46 --> 13446.66]  like,
[13446.84 --> 13447.24]  uh,
[13447.32 --> 13452.00]  like you could use the different lights to indicate things so that you
[13452.00 --> 13454.24]  don't have to try to look up and read what's going on.
[13454.30 --> 13457.90]  If you see it flash one green light as the birdie hits the ground.
[13457.96 --> 13458.14]  Yeah.
[13458.36 --> 13458.72]  You're like,
[13458.72 --> 13458.86]  yeah,
[13458.96 --> 13461.78]  someone scored a point means someone scored a point.
[13461.96 --> 13462.20]  Sweet.
[13462.32 --> 13464.06]  I don't need to check in on what's going on.
[13464.34 --> 13465.04]  Stuff like that.
[13465.04 --> 13467.12]  Because the first version is going to have a lot of,
[13467.12 --> 13467.56]  uh,
[13467.80 --> 13469.30]  edge case issues for sure.
[13469.46 --> 13469.62]  Yeah.
[13469.72 --> 13471.30]  So then after that,
[13471.32 --> 13475.68]  it should be able to fully automatically score keep by using machine
[13475.68 --> 13479.46]  learning to tell what is going on,
[13479.46 --> 13481.74]  which is going to be really hard.
[13481.80 --> 13482.46]  That's tough.
[13482.56 --> 13484.48]  And then in the longer term,
[13485.28 --> 13490.62]  I want it to track who's playing against who and the score and people's
[13490.62 --> 13491.22]  play styles.
[13491.22 --> 13493.30]  So we can build a matchmaking system and build a,
[13493.30 --> 13496.60]  like a universal ladder system and individual people's performance
[13496.60 --> 13498.32]  regarding to you.
[13498.38 --> 13498.94]  You can't,
[13499.02 --> 13501.72]  I don't think it's stats for nerds,
[13501.72 --> 13504.50]  super reasonable to do things like,
[13504.94 --> 13505.12]  Hey,
[13505.24 --> 13505.90]  you're,
[13506.02 --> 13507.00]  uh,
[13507.02 --> 13508.34]  at least right now,
[13508.44 --> 13509.34]  who knows,
[13509.38 --> 13509.92]  maybe someday,
[13510.00 --> 13511.84]  maybe in three years when we get to the stage,
[13511.84 --> 13514.60]  it's significantly easier because software development does that.
[13514.62 --> 13515.56]  And maybe we can figure it out,
[13515.56 --> 13519.80]  but I don't think we should really consider the idea of like exactly
[13519.80 --> 13523.28]  matching people's arm movement and giving them coaching feedback.
[13523.30 --> 13524.36]  But no,
[13524.36 --> 13525.60]  you could do things like,
[13526.04 --> 13526.18]  Hey,
[13526.34 --> 13526.78]  uh,
[13526.84 --> 13528.24]  the back left-hand quadrant,
[13528.24 --> 13529.72]  every time it gets shot there,
[13529.72 --> 13533.10]  you have a lower percentage chance of successfully returning than any other
[13533.10 --> 13533.46]  quadrant.
[13533.66 --> 13536.18]  So if you were going to book some coaching time,
[13536.18 --> 13539.12]  that might be something you want to focus on.
[13539.20 --> 13540.18]  Still not going to make it profitable.
[13540.46 --> 13540.74]  No.
[13540.94 --> 13541.28]  Um,
[13541.28 --> 13541.72]  but yeah,
[13542.14 --> 13542.64]  pretty much.
[13542.90 --> 13543.36]  Um,
[13543.36 --> 13543.76]  and I,
[13543.76 --> 13545.32]  I think that information would be really interesting.
[13545.32 --> 13546.36]  You're also talking about,
[13546.36 --> 13547.04]  um,
[13547.04 --> 13549.34]  like similar to a chess ranking system,
[13549.34 --> 13550.84]  like ranking people inside.
[13550.84 --> 13551.34]  So you can,
[13551.46 --> 13553.08]  you can almost like set up like,
[13553.40 --> 13553.54]  Hey,
[13553.56 --> 13556.24]  you're similarly ranked to me on this thing.
[13556.52 --> 13559.60]  Do you want to show up at a similar time and play each other?
[13559.78 --> 13562.70]  I told you I wanted a phone app so that it could be like,
[13562.86 --> 13563.06]  Hey,
[13563.18 --> 13565.12]  your rival just checked in.
[13565.12 --> 13568.74]  They beat you the last three times you've played.
[13568.88 --> 13570.58]  Do you want to get in the car and go,
[13570.58 --> 13571.02]  uh,
[13571.10 --> 13571.42]  go,
[13571.42 --> 13572.76]  go try and challenge them.
[13573.10 --> 13575.16]  There's some interesting stuff there with like,
[13576.50 --> 13577.04]  you know,
[13577.12 --> 13577.98]  there's a lot of interesting.
[13578.18 --> 13578.20]  Well,
[13578.20 --> 13578.34]  yeah.
[13578.34 --> 13578.60]  I mean,
[13578.64 --> 13579.04]  privacy,
[13579.12 --> 13581.18]  obviously people would have to opt into something like that.
[13581.24 --> 13582.48]  We will figure out all the details.
[13582.50 --> 13583.42]  It has to be a pretty overt,
[13583.60 --> 13583.84]  like,
[13584.00 --> 13584.24]  Hey,
[13584.28 --> 13585.76]  this is what we're going to do.
[13585.84 --> 13588.44]  Make sure you're aware of this before you just automatically click the,
[13588.52 --> 13588.64]  okay.
[13588.78 --> 13589.08]  Yes.
[13589.08 --> 13590.20]  I think that's sweet.
[13590.46 --> 13591.58]  That'd be freaking awesome.
[13591.70 --> 13592.22]  That's sick.
[13592.22 --> 13593.20]  but I just,
[13593.28 --> 13595.10]  I know some people would maybe feel weird about it.
[13595.30 --> 13595.40]  Yeah.
[13595.44 --> 13595.64]  Um,
[13595.64 --> 13598.86]  I think you could also have stuff somewhere else where you like customize your visibility
[13598.86 --> 13599.34]  levels.
[13600.02 --> 13602.22]  So you could like make friends while you're there.
[13602.56 --> 13602.92]  Absolutely.
[13603.14 --> 13603.56]  And be like,
[13603.60 --> 13603.68]  yeah,
[13603.70 --> 13604.82]  I want to add you to my thing.
[13604.82 --> 13605.06]  It would have to be a friend.
[13605.12 --> 13605.54]  Like I said,
[13605.56 --> 13608.44]  it's like someone you played with three times recently.
[13608.68 --> 13608.86]  Yeah.
[13608.96 --> 13609.22]  Like,
[13609.32 --> 13610.54]  like that's what we're talking about.
[13610.58 --> 13611.94]  Someone who's like friended.
[13611.98 --> 13612.18]  Okay.
[13612.18 --> 13612.42]  No,
[13612.48 --> 13612.58]  no,
[13612.58 --> 13613.62]  not like randoms.
[13613.72 --> 13613.84]  Yeah.
[13613.90 --> 13616.62]  So it shouldn't be just everyone at the court or I don't even think it should
[13616.62 --> 13619.38]  necessarily automatically be people that you have played against.
[13619.54 --> 13619.66]  No,
[13619.78 --> 13619.92]  well,
[13619.92 --> 13620.58]  sorry.
[13620.58 --> 13622.18]  That was my implication.
[13622.22 --> 13622.60]  What's your,
[13622.68 --> 13623.12]  what's your,
[13623.24 --> 13623.96]  what's your,
[13623.96 --> 13625.64]  what's your,
[13626.06 --> 13627.16]  Oh,
[13627.24 --> 13627.70]  what now?
[13627.80 --> 13630.92]  So the system's called ass because it's automated scoring.
[13631.02 --> 13631.28]  Yeah.
[13631.50 --> 13631.70]  Yeah.
[13631.70 --> 13633.06]  Like what's your ass tag?
[13633.54 --> 13633.82]  Yeah.
[13634.06 --> 13634.42]  Nice.
[13638.62 --> 13642.38]  You should sell sweatpants and it has people's like handles on the butt.
[13646.34 --> 13647.48]  That's actually pretty good.
[13647.48 --> 13647.88]  Add me,
[13647.96 --> 13648.14]  bro.
[13648.20 --> 13648.76]  What's your handle?
[13648.76 --> 13649.78]  Let me just turn around.
[13652.22 --> 13652.62]  Sorry.
[13652.62 --> 13652.66]  Sorry.
[13652.72 --> 13655.72]  Can I just get a picture of your ass so that I can import it into my phone?
[13656.18 --> 13656.86]  QR code.
[13658.58 --> 13659.70]  QR code right in the middle.
[13660.24 --> 13661.34]  Let me just take a picture of your ass.
[13662.48 --> 13663.66]  Oh my goodness.
[13663.86 --> 13664.56]  Oh man.
[13664.56 --> 13665.30]  So yeah,
[13665.30 --> 13666.98]  we need to hire people for that,
[13667.04 --> 13667.40]  I guess.
[13667.88 --> 13668.02]  Yeah.
[13668.02 --> 13670.72]  And I know that you guys don't care about the badminton side of it,
[13670.72 --> 13672.40]  but that's not what the content will be.
[13672.48 --> 13677.04]  The content will be focused on the tech side of it because the badminton is just an excuse
[13677.04 --> 13678.32]  to build cool tech.
[13678.32 --> 13683.68]  There's just going to be very significant periods of time where there's nothing to show off.
[13684.64 --> 13687.58]  Because like this field is very complicated.
[13687.88 --> 13693.56]  This field is very rife with not necessarily knowing the problems that you're going to run into.
[13693.78 --> 13693.94]  Yeah.
[13694.18 --> 13694.92]  Things like that.
[13694.92 --> 13695.56]  Well,
[13695.56 --> 13699.30]  I fully expect it to go from zero to like,
[13699.38 --> 13699.76]  holy crap,
[13699.82 --> 13701.36]  this kind of works really fast.
[13701.58 --> 13702.68]  And then go from,
[13702.88 --> 13703.14]  holy crap,
[13703.20 --> 13709.32]  this kind of works to it works somewhat consistently over a really long period of time.
[13709.44 --> 13709.56]  Yeah,
[13709.58 --> 13709.94]  probably.
[13710.44 --> 13710.64]  Yeah.
[13710.74 --> 13716.54]  Like I suspect you'll be able to get like people's skeletal models and tracking them pretty quickly.
[13716.70 --> 13722.34]  But like you're going to walk too close to someone and you're going to become one monster of bones and like all these things.
[13722.34 --> 13723.58]  There's going to be lots of,
[13723.58 --> 13724.58]  lots of issues.
[13724.92 --> 13725.78]  Tons of issues.
[13726.02 --> 13730.92]  It's going to be like basically unusable for an extremely long time.
[13732.14 --> 13733.12]  And he knows that.
[13733.30 --> 13734.46]  So it is what it is.
[13736.90 --> 13737.34]  Yeah.
[13737.44 --> 13739.38]  So that job posting is not up,
[13739.58 --> 13741.86]  but I will be making job postings for machine vision.
[13742.22 --> 13743.72]  I drink way too much on this show now.
[13744.16 --> 13744.70]  It also,
[13744.84 --> 13746.40]  it also is going to need,
[13746.46 --> 13747.68]  as he was also referencing,
[13748.12 --> 13750.04]  a website and an app.
[13750.42 --> 13752.70]  So there will also be that,
[13752.76 --> 13753.74]  that needs to be made.
[13753.74 --> 13754.26]  Uh,
[13754.26 --> 13757.28]  but based on what Jaden has already said in the live chat.
[13758.28 --> 13758.72]  Yeah.
[13758.76 --> 13759.16]  I don't know.
[13759.16 --> 13759.52]  The,
[13759.58 --> 13761.68]  the plan is not really to use.
[13762.28 --> 13765.90]  Like people that we already have for this,
[13765.90 --> 13770.16]  because everything we're already doing needs like more help,
[13770.88 --> 13771.66]  not less.
[13771.66 --> 13773.88]  So we can't really divert to this thing.
[13774.48 --> 13774.92]  Um,
[13775.52 --> 13780.48]  but Jaden just posted an unhappy face and I don't like it when Jaden's sad.
[13782.42 --> 13784.04]  So we'll figure something out.
[13784.58 --> 13785.10]  Um,
[13785.48 --> 13786.18]  but yeah,
[13786.18 --> 13788.84]  the idea is not really to lean on the people that we have.
[13788.84 --> 13789.58]  Um,
[13790.34 --> 13790.62]  yeah,
[13790.76 --> 13791.68]  I don't know.
[13793.28 --> 13793.68]  No,
[13793.76 --> 13794.04]  Jaden,
[13794.22 --> 13795.22]  I need you.
[13795.86 --> 13796.26]  Um,
[13796.96 --> 13798.78]  is this after lab or sooner?
[13799.14 --> 13799.42]  Well,
[13799.50 --> 13799.86]  I mean,
[13800.00 --> 13803.44]  what are you talking about necessarily?
[13803.68 --> 13805.38]  So like the hiring is like,
[13805.42 --> 13805.76]  I might,
[13805.90 --> 13806.26]  I don't know,
[13806.34 --> 13808.72]  these postings might go up within the next like couple of weeks.
[13809.40 --> 13810.84]  It more depends on,
[13810.84 --> 13811.80]  uh,
[13811.80 --> 13814.30]  like the financials and accounting and all that kind of stuff.
[13814.30 --> 13815.22]  Then it depends on me.
[13815.78 --> 13816.18]  Um,
[13816.92 --> 13819.96]  but it being like usable,
[13819.96 --> 13820.46]  like,
[13820.54 --> 13820.68]  no,
[13820.72 --> 13824.50]  the lab website's going to be up before this for sure.
[13824.86 --> 13825.32]  Uh,
[13825.54 --> 13825.76]  I,
[13825.94 --> 13827.48]  the timeline that I gave Linus,
[13827.94 --> 13829.30]  I was like,
[13829.34 --> 13830.32]  I don't know.
[13830.44 --> 13835.66]  I'm expecting it's going to be closer to three years than two for it to be
[13835.66 --> 13836.36]  like good.
[13836.92 --> 13837.32]  Um,
[13837.64 --> 13838.56]  because,
[13838.56 --> 13839.18]  I,
[13839.22 --> 13842.10]  I talked to some people on the staff here.
[13842.78 --> 13843.14]  Um,
[13843.42 --> 13844.40]  one of them was Jake Danes.
[13844.44 --> 13844.80]  The other one,
[13844.86 --> 13845.90]  I don't a hundred percent know if,
[13846.12 --> 13846.38]  if,
[13846.70 --> 13847.00]  uh,
[13847.00 --> 13850.72]  they want themselves being like named and stuff on WAN.
[13850.82 --> 13852.52]  So I will refrain from doing that right now,
[13852.52 --> 13853.70]  but they're both.
[13854.70 --> 13855.10]  The,
[13855.22 --> 13858.16]  the second person is specifically in like machine version,
[13858.16 --> 13859.70]  vision and machine learning and stuff here.
[13859.70 --> 13860.38]  And they're very good.
[13860.56 --> 13862.94]  And then there's Jake Danes who,
[13863.04 --> 13864.96]  I don't know if I can say specifically anything.
[13864.96 --> 13867.34]  Cause he just works on as far as I can tell,
[13867.42 --> 13868.38]  literally everything.
[13868.72 --> 13869.12]  Um,
[13869.12 --> 13869.44]  but I,
[13869.44 --> 13872.94]  I sat down with both of them and we had a conversation about feasibility and
[13872.94 --> 13873.60]  stuff like that.
[13873.76 --> 13876.74]  And they quoted a certain amount of devs in a certain amount of time.
[13877.00 --> 13877.76]  And then,
[13877.76 --> 13879.08]  um,
[13879.34 --> 13882.76]  that was a lot of people and not really that much time.
[13882.76 --> 13884.76]  So we're opting for probably less people,
[13884.88 --> 13885.58]  but more time.
[13885.76 --> 13887.12]  Are you still talking about how dumb I am?
[13889.24 --> 13890.80]  I never said you were dumb.
[13893.80 --> 13894.90]  Don't call me out like that,
[13894.96 --> 13895.14]  Luke.
[13896.14 --> 13896.54]  What?
[13896.54 --> 13898.26]  I never said anybody was dumb.
[13898.66 --> 13899.06]  Um,
[13899.36 --> 13900.02]  I just said,
[13900.10 --> 13903.62]  it's not a financially viable direction.
[13904.02 --> 13904.32]  Yeah.
[13904.48 --> 13905.12]  But it is fun.
[13905.20 --> 13905.74]  It's interesting.
[13905.84 --> 13906.18]  Like I'm not,
[13906.22 --> 13907.70]  I'm not completely against it.
[13907.76 --> 13908.38]  Gotta live a little.
[13908.78 --> 13909.06]  Yeah.
[13912.60 --> 13912.92]  Conrad,
[13913.06 --> 13913.92]  just me three days.
[13913.98 --> 13914.44]  I got this.
[13914.52 --> 13914.96]  There you go.
[13915.32 --> 13915.68]  Nice.
[13915.78 --> 13916.20]  That's pretty,
[13916.28 --> 13916.60]  uh,
[13916.60 --> 13918.58]  it's pretty accurate to be perfectly honest.
[13918.58 --> 13921.60]  but yeah,
[13921.64 --> 13922.32]  it's,
[13922.46 --> 13924.68]  it's going to be extremely hard to do.
[13924.84 --> 13926.66]  If you think it would be easy,
[13927.06 --> 13932.20]  I don't think you've fully thought about all the problems.
[13933.68 --> 13934.08]  Yeah.
[13934.44 --> 13934.66]  Yeah.
[13934.66 --> 13936.02]  It's going to be very,
[13936.14 --> 13937.32]  extraordinarily challenging.
[13937.50 --> 13938.92]  I think it's going to be pretty fun though.
[13938.92 --> 13940.08]  Like even the early version,
[13940.18 --> 13941.80]  like I would want to play on that court,
[13941.90 --> 13945.74]  even if we just did scorekeeping through verbal communication,
[13945.74 --> 13948.06]  but like you just watch like what it's doing.
[13948.06 --> 13950.02]  And I think especially for the early versions,
[13950.02 --> 13953.50]  it would be funny to like put up like what it's like,
[13953.52 --> 13954.46]  I'd want to see the,
[13954.46 --> 13955.50]  the skeleton models.
[13955.66 --> 13955.88]  Yeah.
[13956.04 --> 13956.60]  Like I just,
[13956.84 --> 13958.28]  I just think it'd be really entertaining.
[13958.44 --> 13958.80]  I don't know.
[13958.82 --> 13958.96]  Yeah.
[13958.96 --> 13959.50]  A hundred percent.
[13960.18 --> 13961.34]  Like I,
[13961.34 --> 13963.92]  I like pass behind you quickly or something.
[13963.92 --> 13965.76]  We become this like giant bone mass.
[13965.76 --> 13967.52]  And then it like untangles.
[13968.66 --> 13970.02]  I'd probably get distracted,
[13970.28 --> 13972.02]  but it would be fun.
[13972.10 --> 13972.24]  Like,
[13972.28 --> 13972.42]  Ooh,
[13972.48 --> 13973.36]  focus on the game.
[13973.56 --> 13974.20]  I'd also like,
[13974.20 --> 13974.50]  like we,
[13974.52 --> 13975.58]  we talked about how the,
[13975.58 --> 13976.88]  the immediate computation,
[13976.88 --> 13979.74]  if we try to do some complicated things might be really difficult,
[13979.74 --> 13983.42]  but we might be able to do like scorekeeping real time.
[13983.54 --> 13983.78]  Yeah.
[13984.34 --> 13985.90]  Performance rating later.
[13986.24 --> 13986.62]  Oh yeah.
[13986.62 --> 13987.10]  Way later.
[13987.26 --> 13987.52]  So,
[13987.68 --> 13989.70]  but MVP is scorekeeping.
[13990.14 --> 13990.34]  Yeah.
[13990.48 --> 13990.72]  Oh,
[13990.72 --> 13992.14]  I don't mean timeline wise.
[13992.26 --> 13992.56]  Oh,
[13992.76 --> 13994.06]  I mean computationally.
[13994.34 --> 13994.98]  So like,
[13995.06 --> 13995.30]  Oh,
[13995.40 --> 13996.40]  while you're playing,
[13996.42 --> 13998.82]  it's keeping score and it's recording the match.
[13998.90 --> 13999.76]  I understand,
[14000.04 --> 14001.10]  but I want it all in real time.
[14001.58 --> 14002.24]  I'm kidding.
[14002.36 --> 14002.74]  I'm kidding.
[14003.08 --> 14003.48]  Blast.
[14003.64 --> 14004.12]  I'm kidding.
[14004.20 --> 14004.52]  I'm kidding.
[14004.60 --> 14006.18]  It can crunch overnight or whatever.
[14006.18 --> 14006.86]  If it comes to,
[14006.86 --> 14008.86]  I just don't know the feasibility of any of this stuff.
[14009.32 --> 14009.72]  Um,
[14009.86 --> 14011.56]  I put in enough power.
[14014.28 --> 14017.18]  For every court to run.
[14017.38 --> 14017.88]  Hold on.
[14017.92 --> 14019.00]  Let me think for a second.
[14019.86 --> 14024.06]  For every court to run about three GPUs.
[14024.06 --> 14025.06]  Okay.
[14025.80 --> 14026.14]  I mean,
[14026.16 --> 14028.48]  I still don't know at all the feasibility of that,
[14028.84 --> 14030.08]  but that's that just,
[14030.24 --> 14032.76]  I just machine learning and machine machine vision stuff.
[14032.96 --> 14036.92]  The computation required balloons really rapidly.
[14037.24 --> 14037.68]  Yeah.
[14037.84 --> 14038.32]  Um,
[14038.32 --> 14038.56]  okay.
[14038.56 --> 14039.10]  That's fair.
[14039.18 --> 14039.72]  So like,
[14039.86 --> 14041.48]  uh,
[14041.58 --> 14042.32]  I don't know.
[14042.56 --> 14042.98]  Um,
[14043.68 --> 14049.10]  but it's done a lot of computer vision.
[14049.18 --> 14049.40]  Yeah.
[14049.42 --> 14049.86]  Like I,
[14049.92 --> 14050.92]  I don't know.
[14051.02 --> 14052.16]  I will figure it out.
[14052.16 --> 14052.58]  We have,
[14052.68 --> 14056.20]  we have barely dipped toes in thinking about the idea.
[14056.24 --> 14057.32]  Like this is not,
[14057.72 --> 14058.12]  yeah,
[14058.36 --> 14059.00]  don't worry about it.
[14059.26 --> 14060.24]  Three 40 nineties.
[14060.36 --> 14060.66]  Honestly,
[14060.70 --> 14062.96]  by the time this thing was like working,
[14063.10 --> 14063.40]  working,
[14063.52 --> 14065.26]  we're going to be past 4,000 series.
[14065.46 --> 14065.84]  Oh yeah.
[14066.16 --> 14068.20]  Like it's going to take a while.
[14068.32 --> 14068.72]  Okay.
[14069.24 --> 14069.68]  Um,
[14069.74 --> 14071.28]  but if we can do real time,
[14071.32 --> 14071.58]  everything,
[14071.58 --> 14072.14]  that's great.
[14072.80 --> 14073.72]  I'm not saying,
[14073.90 --> 14075.48]  I'm not trying to commit to anything right now.
[14075.48 --> 14075.98]  I have no idea,
[14076.12 --> 14077.24]  but there's a,
[14077.30 --> 14080.42]  there's a potential reality where you're like performance data comes later.
[14080.54 --> 14080.86]  Yeah.
[14081.18 --> 14081.62]  Um,
[14081.62 --> 14088.02]  it might even be able to use the local stuff for like the scorekeeping and yada,
[14088.04 --> 14088.16]  yada,
[14088.22 --> 14088.40]  yada.
[14088.48 --> 14090.24]  And then it like offshores.
[14090.44 --> 14090.70]  Yep.
[14090.78 --> 14092.12]  Some of the data to,
[14092.20 --> 14093.34]  to compute elsewhere.
[14093.50 --> 14093.80]  Well,
[14093.80 --> 14097.22]  given that we're planning to run lands and stuff there,
[14097.22 --> 14099.32]  we'll probably have like a decent connection coming in.
[14099.40 --> 14100.72]  So if we have to send out,
[14100.84 --> 14101.78]  I have no idea.
[14102.44 --> 14103.04]  We'll figure it out.
[14103.04 --> 14103.64]  We'll figure it out.
[14103.98 --> 14105.38]  I think it'll just be cool.
[14105.76 --> 14107.86]  I think it'll be a fun thing to work on.
[14107.86 --> 14108.50]  Um,
[14108.98 --> 14109.34]  but yeah,
[14109.34 --> 14109.76]  it's not,
[14109.88 --> 14111.30]  it's far from profit driven.
[14111.46 --> 14112.26]  Ace Archer says,
[14112.32 --> 14113.66]  want to run it on FPGAs?
[14113.80 --> 14117.68]  I work on doing machine learning on FPGAs for particle accelerators in my day job.
[14117.88 --> 14118.24]  Nice.
[14118.86 --> 14119.26]  Uh,
[14120.26 --> 14120.68]  no,
[14120.84 --> 14121.90]  but that sounds sick.
[14122.02 --> 14123.36]  You should probably keep doing what you're doing.
[14123.54 --> 14123.88]  Yeah.
[14124.50 --> 14124.90]  All right.
[14124.98 --> 14125.62]  What's next?
[14126.48 --> 14126.78]  Oh,
[14126.78 --> 14127.70]  uh,
[14127.70 --> 14128.74]  this next one's from Noah.
[14129.10 --> 14129.52]  Hey,
[14129.62 --> 14131.40]  two merch message slash questions.
[14131.50 --> 14132.36]  First is,
[14132.50 --> 14134.58]  will you ever make an ARGB mouse pad?
[14134.76 --> 14134.96]  Noah.
[14137.08 --> 14137.70]  Get it?
[14137.76 --> 14139.28]  Cause that's his name.
[14140.10 --> 14140.26]  Oh,
[14140.32 --> 14140.62]  is it?
[14140.78 --> 14141.06]  Oh.
[14141.32 --> 14141.66]  Yeah.
[14142.60 --> 14143.48]  Probably not.
[14143.70 --> 14144.10]  I,
[14144.16 --> 14145.04]  I think that,
[14145.14 --> 14145.54]  um,
[14145.68 --> 14146.54]  I don't like them.
[14146.60 --> 14147.46]  There's a spicy take.
[14147.94 --> 14148.26]  Yeah.
[14148.72 --> 14149.12]  Well,
[14149.22 --> 14154.68]  the issue is that we've never found a good diffusion material that,
[14154.68 --> 14155.46]  um,
[14155.46 --> 14159.24]  manages pretty consistent brightness all the way around the track.
[14159.76 --> 14161.16]  And I'm just not happy with it.
[14162.56 --> 14163.82]  Next is the screwdriver.
[14164.24 --> 14165.74]  Could you use the same material?
[14165.84 --> 14167.30]  The bits are made up for the shaft.
[14167.50 --> 14168.40]  I guess you could,
[14168.46 --> 14170.10]  but you wouldn't want to necessarily.
[14170.10 --> 14173.20]  There's different kinds of strength for metal.
[14173.82 --> 14174.26]  Um,
[14174.70 --> 14177.30]  some things you want to be harder,
[14177.52 --> 14180.98]  even if it means they're more brittle while other things you don't mind if
[14180.98 --> 14183.52]  they're softer because it's better for them to be more malleable.
[14183.64 --> 14184.44]  You want them to,
[14184.44 --> 14186.86]  them to fail before the other piece.
[14186.86 --> 14187.14]  Um,
[14187.64 --> 14187.82]  we're,
[14187.88 --> 14190.90]  and we're definitely using industry standard materials for our,
[14191.02 --> 14192.86]  for our shaft and for our bits.
[14194.66 --> 14195.14]  Okay.
[14195.18 --> 14196.06]  Next up is from Rick.
[14196.58 --> 14196.80]  Hey,
[14196.96 --> 14200.30]  Luke and Linus just messed up my merch message on my order.
[14200.42 --> 14201.74]  So here's a gift card too.
[14202.34 --> 14202.82]  Linus,
[14202.86 --> 14206.74]  have you ever had any interest in testing medical stuff like ultrasounds that
[14206.74 --> 14207.78]  connect to tablets?
[14207.78 --> 14209.78]  I mean,
[14209.78 --> 14210.58]  it's really cool,
[14210.70 --> 14213.74]  but it's so niche and sketchy.
[14213.74 --> 14214.48]  And like,
[14214.54 --> 14214.82]  yeah,
[14214.82 --> 14218.90]  am I qualified to evaluate the quality of an ultrasound?
[14219.46 --> 14219.66]  Yeah.
[14219.78 --> 14220.54]  Like why?
[14221.20 --> 14222.20]  I don't want to test that.
[14222.20 --> 14227.68]  The only time we thought about doing something medical related was something I
[14227.68 --> 14232.68]  was trying to do where I was trying to get a cardiology lab to collab with us
[14232.68 --> 14235.24]  on evaluating fitness trackers.
[14235.90 --> 14239.78]  And we got real close and then they bailed.
[14240.12 --> 14240.40]  Yeah.
[14240.62 --> 14241.74]  That would have been super cool.
[14241.82 --> 14242.48]  That would have been cool.
[14242.48 --> 14244.96]  And that's the only way I think personally.
[14246.60 --> 14247.48]  We'd need real scientists.
[14248.24 --> 14248.36]  Yeah.
[14249.92 --> 14250.40]  Yep.
[14251.86 --> 14252.34]  Okay.
[14252.36 --> 14252.88]  Next up.
[14253.34 --> 14253.52]  Yay.
[14253.66 --> 14254.42]  Women's options.
[14254.66 --> 14259.48]  I'm a robotics engineer with the new human robot interface options,
[14260.20 --> 14260.82]  chat GPT,
[14260.94 --> 14261.20]  et cetera.
[14261.20 --> 14265.26]  Do you think that there will be more in-home office robots coming?
[14265.64 --> 14266.12]  Pets,
[14266.28 --> 14266.76]  companions,
[14267.08 --> 14267.40]  assistants.
[14267.76 --> 14270.18]  I'm amazed that some of those like weird,
[14270.18 --> 14271.66]  like pets that,
[14271.66 --> 14272.28]  um,
[14272.32 --> 14273.62]  that you've seen out in Japan or whatever,
[14273.62 --> 14278.44]  I'm amazed that they haven't moved on rolling out a subscription based model
[14278.44 --> 14280.40]  that interacts with chat GPT.
[14280.58 --> 14280.82]  Like it,
[14280.98 --> 14281.88]  I'm sure they're working on it.
[14281.88 --> 14282.18]  That is,
[14282.34 --> 14282.68]  yeah,
[14282.78 --> 14283.22]  that is,
[14283.36 --> 14284.22]  that is happening.
[14284.50 --> 14285.12]  That's coming.
[14285.34 --> 14289.10]  Like a Tamagotchi that actually just chats with you.
[14289.80 --> 14292.98]  There is already those things just on your phone.
[14293.40 --> 14293.64]  Yeah.
[14293.90 --> 14294.38]  Um,
[14294.82 --> 14297.52]  so how long until it comes into the physical world?
[14297.52 --> 14297.78]  Like,
[14297.86 --> 14299.14]  I don't know how long,
[14299.26 --> 14301.42]  how long is it going to take them to manufacture it?
[14301.42 --> 14301.60]  Like,
[14301.64 --> 14303.00]  I'm sure they're working on it right now.
[14303.00 --> 14306.26]  I'm sure real dolls has got a team like working on this,
[14306.38 --> 14307.16]  like actually though,
[14307.20 --> 14307.86]  right now,
[14307.94 --> 14308.26]  probably.
[14309.88 --> 14310.36]  Okay.
[14310.38 --> 14311.74]  And last of the curated,
[14312.30 --> 14312.52]  Hey,
[14312.72 --> 14314.10]  D L and L,
[14314.20 --> 14316.92]  I moved to a rural area not too long ago,
[14316.92 --> 14317.42]  uh,
[14317.42 --> 14319.18]  that has come with some downgrades,
[14319.58 --> 14322.00]  reduced work space and slower wifi.
[14322.00 --> 14324.18]  Have you ever downgraded on purpose?
[14324.18 --> 14325.68]  That wasn't for a video?
[14327.46 --> 14327.94]  Oh,
[14327.94 --> 14329.50]  downgraded on purpose.
[14329.62 --> 14329.90]  Yes.
[14330.52 --> 14330.82]  Yes,
[14330.82 --> 14331.22]  I did.
[14331.40 --> 14339.78]  I downgraded to a small form factor rig with the Radeon 3870.
[14340.28 --> 14340.68]  I,
[14340.80 --> 14341.06]  uh,
[14341.06 --> 14349.42]  I went M A T X because I was moving and I was going to be in a small space and I didn't want to take a big tower with me.
[14349.50 --> 14353.68]  I don't count that one as one of my cases because it was kind of like a temporary setup.
[14353.68 --> 14354.18]  I think that's fair.
[14354.18 --> 14355.98]  It was a whole thing.
[14356.08 --> 14361.36]  I was going through this like weird thing when we were in the lead up to getting married and I was like,
[14361.42 --> 14361.54]  Oh,
[14361.60 --> 14362.34]  I like,
[14362.70 --> 14364.98]  I never like lived with a roommate.
[14364.98 --> 14368.40]  So I moved in with a friend and like a couple of his like school friends.
[14368.54 --> 14371.06]  I think I lasted like less than a month.
[14372.64 --> 14373.04]  Yeah.
[14373.08 --> 14373.78]  It was the whole thing.
[14373.98 --> 14374.88]  Don't worry about it.
[14375.00 --> 14375.22]  Yeah.
[14376.44 --> 14377.06]  So yes,
[14377.06 --> 14383.26]  I downgraded because I had a better GPU than would fit in like that case with like water cooling and stuff.
[14383.26 --> 14385.04]  I think I mostly just wanted to build a new computer.
[14385.92 --> 14389.34]  I can't answer this because it's going to be in an upcoming video.
[14390.08 --> 14390.46]  Nice.
[14391.36 --> 14392.36]  Do I know about this?
[14392.48 --> 14392.70]  No spoilers.
[14393.30 --> 14393.70]  Uh,
[14393.78 --> 14395.38]  I think technically yes.
[14396.42 --> 14396.68]  Hmm.
[14398.00 --> 14398.60]  All right.
[14398.66 --> 14398.78]  Well,
[14398.78 --> 14399.58]  I'm looking forward to it.
[14399.64 --> 14400.04]  Pretty sure.
[14400.26 --> 14400.48]  Yeah.
[14401.60 --> 14402.14]  All right.
[14402.18 --> 14403.52]  We're into potentials and stuff.
[14406.36 --> 14406.76]  Oh,
[14409.82 --> 14411.44]  some of this has already been done.
[14412.48 --> 14412.88]  Really?
[14413.26 --> 14413.74]  Yeah.
[14414.16 --> 14417.26]  There was like asking about physical keyboards on phones.
[14417.46 --> 14418.48]  We definitely did that today.
[14420.34 --> 14420.60]  Uh,
[14420.64 --> 14420.88]  hi,
[14420.96 --> 14424.08]  I heard Linus talk a few times about the upcoming game,
[14424.24 --> 14424.90]  Sea of Stars,
[14424.90 --> 14428.72]  and I've wondered if he heard about or played Chained Echoes,
[14428.78 --> 14430.76]  another awesome 16-bit style JRPG.
[14430.76 --> 14432.52]  No,
[14432.76 --> 14434.52]  I think that's on my list too.
[14439.92 --> 14441.32]  I'm going to start replying to some,
[14441.40 --> 14442.46]  so you guys feel free to,
[14442.46 --> 14444.50]  to pitch in with any you want to talk about.
[14444.88 --> 14445.74]  Someone has a question for me.
[14445.98 --> 14446.34]  Hey guys,
[14446.42 --> 14448.28]  been following since the NCX days.
[14448.96 --> 14449.36]  Crazy,
[14449.44 --> 14450.00]  but awesome ride.
[14450.08 --> 14451.56]  Question for all of you,
[14451.60 --> 14452.26]  but mostly Luke.
[14452.26 --> 14456.46]  Any thoughts on what quantum computing could do with AI in the future?
[14459.82 --> 14460.38]  Uh,
[14460.70 --> 14461.60]  I don't know.
[14461.62 --> 14462.20]  It's going to be nuts.
[14462.66 --> 14465.10]  What we understand about quantum computing,
[14465.36 --> 14466.74]  coding for quantum computers,
[14466.74 --> 14469.56]  and even what AI is going to look like in,
[14470.10 --> 14470.52]  uh,
[14470.56 --> 14471.38]  six months,
[14471.40 --> 14474.24]  let alone three to five years is,
[14474.42 --> 14477.22]  is a very,
[14477.34 --> 14479.38]  very fog of war type situation.
[14479.80 --> 14480.18]  Um,
[14480.28 --> 14481.68]  I think it's going to be pretty wild though.
[14481.98 --> 14486.92]  My excessively limited understanding of programming for quantum systems,
[14486.92 --> 14487.68]  uh,
[14487.68 --> 14488.70]  is that it's,
[14488.78 --> 14490.64]  it's very math based,
[14491.18 --> 14491.66]  uh,
[14491.74 --> 14496.56]  and traditionally you would say like LLMs are not good at that because
[14496.56 --> 14496.88]  they're,
[14496.98 --> 14498.26]  they have like memory issues and stuff.
[14498.74 --> 14499.14]  Um,
[14500.30 --> 14502.76]  but with Wolfram plugged into it,
[14502.80 --> 14504.06]  that changed rapidly.
[14504.56 --> 14508.94]  And LLMs are not like the only thing exists that exists in the AI space.
[14509.42 --> 14509.84]  Um,
[14511.16 --> 14511.58]  so
[14511.58 --> 14515.16]  who knows?
[14515.60 --> 14516.56]  I don't know.
[14519.74 --> 14520.26]  Eamon,
[14520.52 --> 14522.32]  love your talks on AI.
[14522.66 --> 14525.50]  What's the scariest and least scary part of the future of AI,
[14525.68 --> 14525.82]  Luke?
[14526.56 --> 14527.56]  Uh,
[14527.56 --> 14535.06]  he's tired.
[14535.52 --> 14535.94]  Yeah,
[14536.04 --> 14536.80]  he's trying his,
[14536.92 --> 14537.98]  I can hear his brain spinning.
[14538.72 --> 14539.16]  Sometimes.
[14539.36 --> 14539.54]  Okay.
[14539.54 --> 14541.14]  I'll give you the easier part of their question.
[14541.24 --> 14542.70]  Would you ever consider getting a parrot?
[14544.38 --> 14546.02]  Would I consider getting a same,
[14546.02 --> 14546.94]  same merge message?
[14547.06 --> 14547.30]  Uh,
[14547.30 --> 14549.44]  a budget you are is a form of parrot.
[14550.58 --> 14551.58]  So I have one.
[14551.82 --> 14552.24]  I have two.
[14552.66 --> 14553.44]  There you go.
[14553.44 --> 14553.88]  Yeah.
[14554.54 --> 14554.98]  Um,
[14555.06 --> 14555.44]  okay.
[14555.60 --> 14557.04]  The scariest and least scary.
[14557.38 --> 14557.82]  Uh,
[14557.86 --> 14559.98]  I'm not going to answer this perfectly.
[14559.98 --> 14561.16]  I'm going to edit it slightly.
[14561.66 --> 14562.06]  Uh,
[14562.20 --> 14562.36]  I,
[14562.50 --> 14565.94]  the scariest part is the amount of disenfranchised people,
[14565.94 --> 14567.68]  the amount of displaced people,
[14568.00 --> 14570.94]  the amount of people whose lives just get completely turned upside down.
[14571.10 --> 14577.66]  I am personally feeling very sad for people that are in education right now.
[14577.66 --> 14584.66]  And if that path gets destroyed and they are not on very,
[14584.66 --> 14585.14]  uh,
[14585.14 --> 14586.90]  privileged financial grounds,
[14586.90 --> 14589.54]  that could be extremely negative for their lives.
[14589.94 --> 14592.16]  And that is something that I'm concerned about.
[14592.20 --> 14593.32]  Cause I was thinking about like the,
[14593.66 --> 14594.10]  the,
[14594.22 --> 14596.50]  the situation that I was in when I was back in school.
[14596.50 --> 14597.98]  If,
[14598.10 --> 14601.84]  if like this thing never happened and my path was to continue going on the school route,
[14601.96 --> 14603.92]  it looks pretty bright when I was on it.
[14604.02 --> 14605.28]  If that just disappeared,
[14605.52 --> 14608.68]  I would have been pretty screwed.
[14608.86 --> 14610.84]  I had other routes for sure.
[14611.42 --> 14613.36]  I could have followed my dad and what he was doing.
[14613.46 --> 14614.42]  I could have done other things,
[14614.62 --> 14618.86]  but not everyone's kind of like that.
[14618.92 --> 14620.66]  Someone brought up AI misalignment.
[14620.84 --> 14621.22]  Like,
[14621.28 --> 14621.54]  yeah,
[14621.64 --> 14622.58]  that's a thing too.
[14623.04 --> 14623.36]  Um,
[14623.36 --> 14624.86]  there's a lot to fear about it.
[14624.86 --> 14625.46]  I,
[14625.62 --> 14627.26]  I also,
[14627.46 --> 14627.72]  however,
[14628.18 --> 14628.62]  think,
[14628.76 --> 14629.74]  um,
[14630.08 --> 14636.74]  that there's so many unknowns and there's also a lot to be excited about with it.
[14637.68 --> 14643.24]  I think it is the single biggest thing that can contribute towards,
[14643.24 --> 14645.06]  uh,
[14645.08 --> 14646.40]  what's the right word for this?
[14646.76 --> 14647.40]  Like self,
[14647.48 --> 14648.36]  self agency,
[14648.36 --> 14651.02]  isn't it being able to be self-reliant,
[14651.16 --> 14652.74]  which is kind of weird,
[14652.74 --> 14657.74]  but you could use it and then potentially future robotic implements or whatever else
[14657.74 --> 14661.04]  to get an insane amount of stuff done as an individual.
[14661.40 --> 14663.38]  So you could become more self-reliant.
[14663.42 --> 14664.72]  You could become more self-sufficient.
[14664.72 --> 14667.34]  Does this mean you can live anywhere you want?
[14667.44 --> 14668.34]  Maybe not necessarily.
[14668.34 --> 14669.98]  You might need cheaper housing.
[14669.98 --> 14673.28]  You might need some form of land so you can grow stuff,
[14673.44 --> 14673.68]  whatever,
[14673.68 --> 14676.48]  but like the ability to get things done on your own,
[14676.54 --> 14677.82]  the ability to teach yourself,
[14677.82 --> 14681.48]  the ability to do all this other kind of stuff is going to absolutely balloon.
[14682.16 --> 14682.60]  Um,
[14683.14 --> 14683.44]  someone,
[14683.58 --> 14683.68]  yeah,
[14683.76 --> 14685.86]  headline AI will displace 300 million jobs.
[14685.90 --> 14686.74]  That was a headline.
[14686.90 --> 14688.34]  I did read that headline as well.
[14688.70 --> 14689.86]  I don't think.
[14692.32 --> 14694.96]  Just like with a lot of technological advancements in the past,
[14694.96 --> 14696.92]  there's been a huge amount of displaced jobs.
[14696.92 --> 14701.30]  If you don't think the internet completely wrecked entire industries,
[14701.78 --> 14702.46]  you're delusional.
[14702.68 --> 14704.88]  The internet also created a ton of jobs.
[14705.58 --> 14705.70]  Yep.
[14705.90 --> 14710.10]  This one has a huge potential to not replace the jobs.
[14710.42 --> 14710.82]  Yeah.
[14711.52 --> 14712.42]  So that's scary.
[14712.42 --> 14715.38]  With just like performing menial.
[14715.94 --> 14716.34]  Yes.
[14716.70 --> 14718.64]  But there's other arguments to that too.
[14718.90 --> 14722.64]  There's a huge amount of people that do that already.
[14723.48 --> 14725.46]  There's a huge amount of people that show up to work.
[14725.56 --> 14726.58]  There's like memes about it.
[14726.58 --> 14726.68]  Oh,
[14726.72 --> 14729.06]  I show up to work because like the,
[14729.32 --> 14731.04]  I get paid to look at Reddit.
[14731.92 --> 14732.72]  Stuff like that.
[14732.88 --> 14735.80]  There's also a huge amount of people that work really darn hard.
[14736.24 --> 14736.34]  The,
[14736.48 --> 14739.02]  one of the main things that seems to be getting replaced,
[14739.02 --> 14741.82]  if you want to call it that by AI right now is software development,
[14741.82 --> 14742.06]  right?
[14742.06 --> 14742.50]  Yeah.
[14742.68 --> 14742.98]  Yeah.
[14743.10 --> 14743.42]  Okay.
[14743.56 --> 14743.80]  Except,
[14744.08 --> 14751.12]  except totally not because the amount of like code that we need to improve and
[14751.12 --> 14754.98]  automate things around the world is insanely immense.
[14754.98 --> 14759.60]  And like the amount of workspaces that would benefit from having developers at
[14759.60 --> 14764.02]  them that can't not afford to have developers at all is super expensive.
[14764.08 --> 14765.36]  Like they're never going to hire one.
[14765.58 --> 14766.32]  They can't.
[14766.32 --> 14766.64]  Yeah.
[14766.64 --> 14771.06]  Now they would be able to have that benefit and the places that can hire developers being
[14771.06 --> 14772.10]  able to use them to,
[14772.18 --> 14772.60]  to,
[14772.74 --> 14774.36]  to guide these things.
[14775.02 --> 14777.52]  Cause even if it's like better than you,
[14777.52 --> 14779.12]  okay,
[14779.78 --> 14780.42]  well,
[14780.54 --> 14782.22]  you can still help guide it.
[14782.38 --> 14783.32]  You can direct it.
[14783.32 --> 14784.94]  A car is a lot faster than you.
[14785.64 --> 14786.68]  You can still drive it.
[14787.10 --> 14787.68]  Like I,
[14787.80 --> 14788.54]  I don't know.
[14788.64 --> 14789.30]  I don't think,
[14789.36 --> 14793.54]  I don't think just doom and glooming about it is fair.
[14793.78 --> 14797.76]  I also don't think just looking at it with positivity is fair.
[14798.10 --> 14799.82]  It's going to be extremely destructive.
[14800.06 --> 14802.22]  It's also going to be extremely constructive.
[14803.02 --> 14803.60]  And I,
[14803.60 --> 14805.44]  I think if you want to be ahead of the curve,
[14805.44 --> 14810.00]  the right approach is not to just be freaked out 100% of the time.
[14810.10 --> 14814.68]  It's to try to keep riding that wave as much as you can.
[14817.40 --> 14818.88]  While I've curated a few.
[14819.34 --> 14822.10]  While Linus replies to a couple more,
[14822.16 --> 14823.06]  I've got another one here for you,
[14823.08 --> 14823.24]  Luke.
[14823.50 --> 14825.54]  Good morning to all from Malaysia.
[14825.92 --> 14826.98]  Want to ask Luke,
[14827.04 --> 14829.20]  since you can eat chicken and rice every day,
[14829.30 --> 14833.52]  did you change the seasoning for the chicken and any substitute for rice?
[14833.52 --> 14835.00]  Uh,
[14835.28 --> 14835.68]  quinoa,
[14835.98 --> 14836.52]  um,
[14836.66 --> 14838.10]  changing the seasoning.
[14840.50 --> 14841.38]  Decently often.
[14841.56 --> 14841.74]  Sure.
[14841.86 --> 14843.54]  But if I'm being completely honest,
[14843.66 --> 14845.78]  probably 90% of the time,
[14845.82 --> 14847.14]  it's Frank's red extra hot.
[14848.84 --> 14850.28]  I don't seem to get tired of that.
[14850.44 --> 14851.42]  So it is what it is.
[14851.82 --> 14852.26]  Um,
[14853.20 --> 14853.70]  yeah,
[14853.82 --> 14857.64]  I've started trying to get more,
[14857.64 --> 14858.84]  uh,
[14858.86 --> 14863.34]  like beef and fish incorporated to try to mix things up a little bit.
[14863.88 --> 14867.84]  Just because it's probably not like good for you to only eat that all the time.
[14868.60 --> 14869.18]  But yeah,
[14869.34 --> 14869.70]  veggies,
[14870.18 --> 14873.84]  chicken and rice is still a vast majority of it.
[14876.14 --> 14877.16]  So I got weight to lose,
[14877.26 --> 14877.40]  man.
[14877.64 --> 14877.88]  I'm,
[14877.88 --> 14878.04]  I'm,
[14878.12 --> 14878.66]  I'm like,
[14878.72 --> 14880.38]  I've come pretty far,
[14880.48 --> 14881.64]  but I still have a long way to go.
[14882.18 --> 14883.06]  It is what it is.
[14883.36 --> 14888.50]  I don't think I'll be at what I will personally be happy with for,
[14888.64 --> 14890.26]  for a bit now over a year.
[14890.58 --> 14891.20]  And that's fine.
[14891.52 --> 14892.16]  I'm on the path.
[14892.22 --> 14892.56]  It's going.
[14892.64 --> 14892.76]  Okay.
[14896.08 --> 14897.72]  You can feel free to start hitting me with them.
[14897.78 --> 14898.82]  I'm down to just a few done.
[14899.28 --> 14899.54]  Okay.
[14899.70 --> 14900.06]  Excellent.
[14900.70 --> 14901.10]  Um,
[14901.30 --> 14901.74]  hi Linus.
[14901.74 --> 14906.04]  Are you planning to upgrade your framework to Intel 13th gen or Ryzen?
[14906.18 --> 14908.76]  I've gotten 11th gen and pre-ordered Ryzen seven.
[14910.36 --> 14910.76]  So,
[14910.76 --> 14911.06]  uh,
[14911.06 --> 14913.16]  framework actually reached out to me about that today.
[14913.60 --> 14914.30]  They were like,
[14914.40 --> 14914.64]  Hey,
[14914.64 --> 14918.12]  so we did that video where you talked about the upcoming launch,
[14918.62 --> 14923.08]  but are you going to cover the new stuff at all?
[14923.50 --> 14925.28]  And I was kind of sitting there going,
[14925.36 --> 14925.44]  Oh,
[14925.46 --> 14927.20]  I hadn't actually really thought about it.
[14927.20 --> 14927.54]  Uh,
[14927.54 --> 14929.54]  my intention was to wait for Ryzen,
[14929.72 --> 14936.40]  but 13th gen is also pretty interesting and could be an opportunity to do a
[14936.40 --> 14938.32]  completely different kind of video.
[14938.32 --> 14943.06]  So there's that cooler master case that's designed to take your old framework,
[14943.34 --> 14944.12]  uh,
[14944.12 --> 14945.18]  your old framework motherboard.
[14945.38 --> 14947.82]  So I was kind of thinking it would be really cool.
[14948.14 --> 14948.62]  I got it.
[14949.80 --> 14950.06]  Oh,
[14950.54 --> 14951.10]  I got it.
[14951.12 --> 14951.22]  Go.
[14951.36 --> 14951.62]  Okay.
[14952.32 --> 14956.12]  I was thinking it would be really cool to do a video where the main focus is
[14956.12 --> 14958.46]  actually on building that,
[14958.46 --> 14960.18]  that cooler master gaming rig.
[14960.22 --> 14962.90]  Maybe when we do the LTX whale land,
[14963.28 --> 14965.96]  I build the framework gaming PC.
[14965.96 --> 14972.18]  So it's just my 12th gen framework motherboard in the cooler master case with an
[14972.18 --> 14974.16]  external GPU or something like that.
[14974.34 --> 14975.14]  And I take it,
[14975.22 --> 14980.26]  I do all my land gaming on just this like tiny framework laptop motherboard.
[14980.40 --> 14981.36]  I think that'd be super cool.
[14981.52 --> 14982.78]  And then as part of that,
[14983.34 --> 14984.44]  well,
[14984.48 --> 14987.14]  I guess I'll have to have a motherboard to put into my computer.
[14987.30 --> 14988.42]  So I'll get the 13th gen one.
[14988.48 --> 14988.88]  I'll put it in there.
[14988.94 --> 14991.78]  But what the one that I'm really excited for is the Ryzen one,
[14992.60 --> 14992.88]  man,
[14993.46 --> 14995.60]  AMD's current Zen four.
[14995.60 --> 14998.20]  Zen four is so freaking efficient.
[14999.00 --> 15000.84]  And if I,
[15000.94 --> 15003.68]  if I don't end up doing the video with the cooler master case,
[15003.68 --> 15005.60]  then I'm just going to wait.
[15005.60 --> 15007.50]  And I think I'm going to upgrade to Zen four.
[15007.64 --> 15009.96]  I don't think I'm going to go to the framework 16.
[15010.14 --> 15015.10]  I just don't think I want to carry around a 16 inch laptop ever again,
[15015.10 --> 15017.40]  no matter how cool and sexy it is.
[15017.70 --> 15018.46]  But I'll be,
[15018.56 --> 15020.10]  I'll be really happy with the,
[15020.34 --> 15023.44]  I'm really happy with the upgrades they keep providing for the framework 13.
[15023.44 --> 15025.18]  So who knows?
[15025.26 --> 15025.48]  I may,
[15025.58 --> 15026.06]  might do one,
[15026.14 --> 15026.74]  might do both.
[15026.84 --> 15027.54]  We'll see how it goes.
[15029.68 --> 15030.12]  Okay.
[15030.18 --> 15030.80]  Next up.
[15031.36 --> 15035.12]  What was the most annoying bugs from the early days of developing float plane?
[15035.38 --> 15038.16]  Something that was hard to patch and was frustrating for users,
[15038.16 --> 15040.26]  but not necessarily harmful to them.
[15040.26 --> 15042.48]  I have a kind of an answer for this,
[15042.58 --> 15044.12]  but I'll see if Luke has something.
[15044.28 --> 15044.42]  No,
[15044.42 --> 15044.94]  go for it.
[15045.20 --> 15045.44]  Oh,
[15045.52 --> 15045.78]  okay.
[15046.58 --> 15048.96]  It wasn't necessarily harmful to users,
[15048.96 --> 15052.12]  but we had a lot of issues with payments in the early days,
[15052.12 --> 15054.40]  back when it was running on the forum.
[15054.86 --> 15058.04]  And I think Luke will probably remember some of the specific bugs,
[15058.24 --> 15063.94]  but we would have people try to buy a subscription and it just wouldn't bill them.
[15064.18 --> 15068.02]  We would have people try to buy a subscription and it would double bill them.
[15068.02 --> 15068.60]  And like,
[15068.64 --> 15069.28]  we could do,
[15069.40 --> 15071.08]  we could do certain amount of things with the forum,
[15071.16 --> 15073.38]  but the payments portion was closed code.
[15073.86 --> 15074.98]  So like I,
[15075.18 --> 15076.46]  we could not fix them.
[15076.64 --> 15078.06]  That was very frustrating.
[15078.28 --> 15079.66]  We've obviously had our,
[15079.70 --> 15081.20]  our fair share of bugs.
[15081.32 --> 15082.44]  We've been in production.
[15083.26 --> 15086.28]  100% of the existence of the platform.
[15086.56 --> 15087.18]  That's like,
[15087.32 --> 15088.84]  that's something I can say of,
[15089.12 --> 15089.46]  uh,
[15089.46 --> 15090.76]  for pretty much no one.
[15091.20 --> 15091.64]  Um,
[15091.64 --> 15092.18]  and it's,
[15092.28 --> 15094.08]  it's been a rocky road at times,
[15094.08 --> 15095.66]  but in general we do pretty good,
[15095.70 --> 15095.94]  but yeah,
[15095.94 --> 15097.04]  we've had our fair amount of bugs,
[15097.04 --> 15097.50]  but that,
[15097.70 --> 15101.80]  that was extremely frustrating because the team has never shied away from
[15101.80 --> 15104.66]  squashing bugs and we've been able to fix things generally,
[15104.66 --> 15106.08]  but we couldn't fix that.
[15106.20 --> 15109.98]  That was actually a big part of the reason why we wanted to move to an
[15109.98 --> 15116.08]  external site at all was just the payments being so impossible to fix.
[15116.98 --> 15117.46]  Yeah.
[15117.46 --> 15125.70]  Someone just asked me what acoustic about using acoustic cameras in the lab.
[15125.78 --> 15127.28]  Do you know what an acoustic camera is?
[15127.62 --> 15128.68]  Isn't that a microphone?
[15128.92 --> 15129.58]  I guess not.
[15129.92 --> 15130.26]  Um,
[15130.46 --> 15130.78]  no,
[15130.78 --> 15134.84]  but I made a note for myself to follow it up with Gary and see if,
[15135.54 --> 15138.70]  see if that's something that would be useful.
[15139.12 --> 15139.36]  What?
[15139.60 --> 15139.90]  Yeah.
[15140.10 --> 15140.88]  Acoustic cameras.
[15140.98 --> 15141.12]  I don't,
[15141.20 --> 15141.56]  I don't know,
[15141.62 --> 15141.78]  man.
[15142.26 --> 15142.48]  Uh,
[15142.48 --> 15144.06]  it's one of the incoming merch messages.
[15144.20 --> 15145.34]  I'm just going to show that.
[15145.44 --> 15145.64]  All right,
[15145.68 --> 15145.88]  Dan,
[15145.90 --> 15146.34]  what do you got?
[15146.66 --> 15147.78]  Portable acoustic camera.
[15147.88 --> 15148.60]  What is this?
[15149.46 --> 15149.66]  Oh,
[15149.66 --> 15150.74]  they're going to nerd out about it.
[15150.84 --> 15151.36]  I'm excited.
[15152.22 --> 15152.62]  Um,
[15153.36 --> 15153.72]  yeah.
[15153.72 --> 15153.96]  Okay.
[15154.14 --> 15154.70]  Uh,
[15154.70 --> 15156.52]  I forgot to archive that one.
[15156.96 --> 15157.18]  Okay.
[15157.34 --> 15157.74]  Hello.
[15157.98 --> 15161.82]  Apple launches their devices almost at the same time worldwide.
[15162.24 --> 15165.88]  Why do other big companies like Samsung not do that?
[15166.10 --> 15166.38]  Uh,
[15166.38 --> 15166.90]  for example,
[15166.90 --> 15170.42]  the galaxy S 23 is not available in Japan even now,
[15170.54 --> 15171.90]  but the yellow iPhone is.
[15173.16 --> 15174.86]  It's really hard.
[15175.76 --> 15178.04]  I don't know what to tell you other than that.
[15178.14 --> 15181.54]  Everything from the localization of the product to the,
[15181.54 --> 15182.16]  uh,
[15182.16 --> 15183.56]  producing enough,
[15183.72 --> 15185.06]  to sustain a launch.
[15185.14 --> 15185.58]  Cause like,
[15185.64 --> 15186.24]  think about it.
[15186.88 --> 15189.92]  If valve had launched the steam deck globally,
[15189.92 --> 15191.32]  right out of the gate,
[15191.76 --> 15198.92]  all they would have accomplished is that everyone would have been mad that it's
[15198.92 --> 15199.54]  backordered,
[15199.78 --> 15201.02]  right?
[15201.50 --> 15205.66]  If they can't produce enough of them for one region or two regions,
[15205.66 --> 15209.98]  what is the point of opening up orders to the entire world?
[15210.96 --> 15211.80]  It's tough.
[15211.94 --> 15212.42]  It's really,
[15212.58 --> 15213.02]  really hard.
[15213.02 --> 15213.66]  Um,
[15214.38 --> 15215.64]  I think that was,
[15215.78 --> 15216.52]  that was basically,
[15216.52 --> 15218.70]  I think that was basically going to be my answer.
[15219.38 --> 15222.98]  Apple is an incredible logistics company.
[15223.94 --> 15224.38]  Unbelievable.
[15224.70 --> 15227.02]  The fact that they launch a new iPhone every year,
[15227.10 --> 15229.92]  come hell or high water is a modern miracle.
[15230.16 --> 15231.26]  And their shareholders love it.
[15231.26 --> 15232.34]  And their users love it.
[15232.50 --> 15233.82]  And they're really good at that.
[15233.90 --> 15235.38]  There's some things I don't like about Apple,
[15235.38 --> 15236.02]  but their,
[15236.02 --> 15241.24]  their global logistics management is absolutely not one of them.
[15242.94 --> 15245.04]  Have you figured out what an acoustic camera is?
[15246.12 --> 15246.36]  Uh,
[15246.36 --> 15248.28]  I figured out that they exist.
[15248.62 --> 15249.06]  Um,
[15249.06 --> 15252.92]  I don't think they're actual cameras.
[15253.64 --> 15253.86]  Oh,
[15253.86 --> 15256.12]  so it's like a raise of microphones that,
[15256.32 --> 15256.48]  that,
[15256.60 --> 15257.46]  so it's a directional,
[15257.46 --> 15258.98]  like microphone.
[15258.98 --> 15259.90]  I think so.
[15259.98 --> 15261.96]  Like it's computational and it figures out where,
[15262.16 --> 15262.40]  you know,
[15262.42 --> 15263.64]  I have a weird ticking in my house.
[15263.72 --> 15265.50]  Maybe an acoustic camera could be the solution.
[15266.34 --> 15267.98]  I'm trying to figure out where it's coming from.
[15267.98 --> 15269.78]  Cause I don't have any clocks.
[15269.94 --> 15270.62]  So what's ticking?
[15271.34 --> 15272.28]  Could be a bomb.
[15278.28 --> 15279.32]  It might be two.
[15280.22 --> 15280.88]  That's true.
[15281.24 --> 15281.86]  You're right.
[15281.96 --> 15282.44]  Two bombs.
[15283.02 --> 15284.06]  That would be worse.
[15286.12 --> 15286.52]  Yeah.
[15286.58 --> 15287.42]  A lot of the,
[15287.42 --> 15289.98]  the sites that I try to jump to have very aggressive.
[15290.58 --> 15290.98]  Wow.
[15291.08 --> 15291.52]  That's a,
[15291.52 --> 15292.10]  that is aggressive.
[15292.38 --> 15292.52]  Yeah.
[15292.68 --> 15293.04]  Yeah.
[15293.14 --> 15293.32]  Right.
[15293.32 --> 15295.26]  Like he can see my screen,
[15295.46 --> 15296.72]  but yeah,
[15296.72 --> 15297.02]  I don't,
[15297.08 --> 15297.48]  I don't know.
[15298.46 --> 15298.72]  Yeah.
[15299.12 --> 15300.56]  They look really interesting.
[15300.64 --> 15301.56]  I've just never heard of them before.
[15301.98 --> 15302.40]  Okay.
[15302.42 --> 15302.78]  Next up.
[15303.04 --> 15303.24]  Hi,
[15303.30 --> 15304.04]  Luke and Linus.
[15304.14 --> 15307.66]  How do you think Microsoft should compensate writers for the web pages that
[15307.66 --> 15309.26]  Bing chat is accessing?
[15309.76 --> 15313.46]  Cause if people aren't seeing ads to support those websites,
[15313.46 --> 15314.44]  they might disappear.
[15314.64 --> 15317.26]  This is a huge problem.
[15317.60 --> 15318.48]  Age old problem.
[15318.60 --> 15319.50]  As old as the internet.
[15320.20 --> 15320.48]  Yeah.
[15320.48 --> 15322.94]  But just like with all AI things,
[15323.06 --> 15326.04]  this just like blows it up to such a ridiculous degree that it's like,
[15326.16 --> 15326.46]  oh wow,
[15326.46 --> 15327.98]  we actually really need to address this now.
[15328.08 --> 15328.18]  I mean,
[15328.20 --> 15329.44]  it was already a big problem.
[15329.52 --> 15333.24]  You Google search something and they have like kind of the answer and you could
[15333.24 --> 15334.24]  click through to the website,
[15334.24 --> 15336.26]  but you won't because the answer is already there.
[15336.38 --> 15336.56]  Yep.
[15336.72 --> 15338.32]  This is that like,
[15338.94 --> 15339.46]  right.
[15339.54 --> 15339.80]  It out.
[15339.80 --> 15340.80]  So hard.
[15341.26 --> 15341.48]  Yeah.
[15341.88 --> 15342.10]  Yeah.
[15342.10 --> 15343.52]  This is actually crazy.
[15343.64 --> 15344.16]  Um,
[15344.16 --> 15347.68]  and it's an interesting topic for us because we're building the labs website,
[15347.68 --> 15354.38]  which like the way that it's being built so far is very beneficial to one of these systems,
[15354.38 --> 15355.88]  just taking everything from it.
[15355.88 --> 15357.88]  Um,
[15357.88 --> 15360.46]  so it's rough,
[15360.56 --> 15360.84]  man.
[15360.94 --> 15361.56]  I don't know.
[15361.72 --> 15362.16]  There's,
[15362.24 --> 15363.92]  there's this whole problem where like,
[15364.04 --> 15364.34]  if,
[15364.62 --> 15368.12]  if these AI systems continue to work how they currently do,
[15368.12 --> 15371.04]  and then everyone starts to use them for everything,
[15371.40 --> 15374.40]  all these companies that generate the data are going to disappear.
[15374.64 --> 15378.86]  And then the AI systems aren't going to have anything to lean on for having the data.
[15378.86 --> 15385.38]  But big tech has shown that they're willing to just consume everything like a swarm of locusts in their path.
[15385.46 --> 15385.68]  Yep.
[15385.68 --> 15387.22]  And they don't want to compensate,
[15387.54 --> 15388.28]  say for example,
[15388.54 --> 15393.34]  journalists for doing the actual primary sourcing of news.
[15393.82 --> 15394.30]  Um,
[15394.38 --> 15394.64]  yeah,
[15394.74 --> 15394.90]  yeah.
[15394.90 --> 15395.72]  It's going to be a big problem.
[15395.90 --> 15397.32]  It's going to be a huge problem.
[15397.90 --> 15398.28]  Yeah.
[15398.60 --> 15402.06]  The creators of information potentially vanishing,
[15402.30 --> 15403.04]  um,
[15403.04 --> 15406.66]  is a bit of an issue for the system that utilizes that information.
[15407.04 --> 15411.06]  But does that mean that the system that utilizes that information is going to want to compensate them?
[15411.38 --> 15412.28]  Probably no.
[15412.58 --> 15414.00]  So is it going to eat itself?
[15415.68 --> 15416.94]  Or a Boris AI.
[15417.34 --> 15417.82]  We'll see.
[15419.82 --> 15420.26]  Yeah.
[15420.38 --> 15421.68]  It's an interesting discussion.
[15422.28 --> 15422.56]  Okay.
[15422.60 --> 15423.20]  Next up.
[15423.90 --> 15424.02]  Hey,
[15424.06 --> 15424.26]  Luke,
[15424.46 --> 15429.52]  can you tell a story of what happened to that red car that got you stuck on a bridge that one time?
[15429.60 --> 15431.26]  Sorry if you've already answered this before.
[15431.38 --> 15432.04]  Love the show.
[15432.20 --> 15433.16]  Can I tell the story?
[15433.66 --> 15434.06]  Um,
[15434.44 --> 15434.76]  the,
[15434.90 --> 15438.76]  the fuel pumps blew up on a bridge.
[15439.20 --> 15439.64]  Um,
[15439.78 --> 15440.18]  sick.
[15441.50 --> 15445.06]  And I was in like the middle lane of the bridge and the car just died.
[15445.06 --> 15446.06]  Like it wasn't like,
[15446.18 --> 15446.26]  Oh,
[15446.28 --> 15449.06]  it's sputtering for a while and I can do whatever I can pull over.
[15449.16 --> 15449.28]  Like,
[15449.32 --> 15449.42]  no,
[15449.46 --> 15449.70]  it just,
[15449.78 --> 15450.64]  it just died immediately.
[15451.16 --> 15451.56]  Um,
[15451.56 --> 15453.28]  I was on the uphill of the bridge.
[15453.68 --> 15454.46]  So I,
[15454.50 --> 15454.82]  I,
[15455.12 --> 15455.62]  uh,
[15456.28 --> 15456.86]  uh,
[15456.92 --> 15462.82]  I called Linus because I was too cheap and I knew he had BCAA so he could get my car taken out of there.
[15463.00 --> 15464.20]  That's triple AA for you,
[15464.28 --> 15465.32]  my American friends.
[15465.48 --> 15465.70]  Yeah.
[15465.70 --> 15466.26]  Um,
[15466.26 --> 15467.50]  so I called him and he,
[15467.58 --> 15469.08]  he came and saved me,
[15469.18 --> 15471.36]  but also roasted me in classic Linus fashion.
[15471.74 --> 15473.96]  I was flattered that you called me instead of your parents.
[15474.08 --> 15475.30]  Now I know it was just about the money.
[15475.42 --> 15475.74]  Got it.
[15475.98 --> 15476.38]  Ha ha.
[15478.86 --> 15479.30]  Um.
[15479.42 --> 15481.52]  He was also calling to say he was going to be late for work.
[15481.64 --> 15482.12]  That too.
[15482.28 --> 15482.48]  Yeah.
[15482.48 --> 15483.48]  I was on my way to work.
[15483.98 --> 15484.38]  Um,
[15484.62 --> 15485.74]  and then,
[15485.80 --> 15485.96]  yeah,
[15485.96 --> 15489.32]  I stood in the back of the convertible and flagged traffic.
[15489.32 --> 15490.32]  Um,
[15491.56 --> 15494.02]  which a local radio show thought was quite funny,
[15494.02 --> 15496.14]  but actually did totally work.
[15496.22 --> 15496.40]  Yeah.
[15496.68 --> 15497.48]  Like very helpful.
[15497.62 --> 15498.36]  He saw it.
[15498.40 --> 15498.60]  It,
[15499.44 --> 15501.10]  traffic kept flowing like quite effectively.
[15501.66 --> 15502.16]  Um,
[15502.44 --> 15504.00]  police came by and were like,
[15504.00 --> 15508.70]  not a hundred percent stoked about me standing in my car to direct traffic,
[15508.70 --> 15509.76]  but they were also like,
[15509.82 --> 15511.38]  at the same time,
[15511.38 --> 15515.12]  usually this would like stop bridge traffic and it's flowing just fine.
[15515.12 --> 15515.58]  So like,
[15515.68 --> 15518.02]  we're not going to necessarily tell you to stop.
[15518.02 --> 15519.98]  And then they just took off,
[15520.04 --> 15520.70]  which was interesting.
[15521.32 --> 15521.72]  Um,
[15522.62 --> 15523.98]  but yeah,
[15523.98 --> 15524.18]  I mean,
[15524.18 --> 15524.88]  that's about it.
[15525.14 --> 15525.56]  Once,
[15525.70 --> 15526.90]  once I got it to a mechanic,
[15526.90 --> 15528.36]  I was basically told like,
[15528.40 --> 15530.26]  this is extremely not worth repairing.
[15530.46 --> 15530.86]  Yeah.
[15531.16 --> 15531.60]  Um,
[15531.60 --> 15532.18]  because there,
[15532.36 --> 15533.18]  and I knew this,
[15533.24 --> 15535.68]  there was a lot wrong with it other than just the,
[15535.68 --> 15536.62]  the fuel pumps.
[15536.74 --> 15539.48]  There was like a very considerable amount wrong with it.
[15539.76 --> 15540.14]  Um,
[15540.26 --> 15540.50]  cough,
[15540.58 --> 15540.80]  cough,
[15541.12 --> 15543.06]  zero of the gauges in the car worked.
[15543.70 --> 15544.14]  Um,
[15544.24 --> 15546.00]  Oh no,
[15546.00 --> 15546.76]  the tack worked.
[15547.24 --> 15548.00]  Nothing else worked.
[15548.02 --> 15548.60]  Except for the tack.
[15549.26 --> 15549.62]  Um,
[15549.90 --> 15554.06]  but it was old and it was kind of fairly poorly maintained and stuff.
[15554.46 --> 15555.22]  So it was,
[15555.32 --> 15555.68]  it's time.
[15556.30 --> 15557.02]  And that's it.
[15557.76 --> 15558.94]  Sounds like me.
[15559.80 --> 15560.24]  Um,
[15560.32 --> 15562.54]  next up is,
[15562.66 --> 15562.96]  well,
[15562.96 --> 15564.68]  the last one we have today is from Nicholas.
[15565.10 --> 15565.50]  Uh,
[15565.50 --> 15565.96]  Hey guys,
[15566.12 --> 15569.72]  excited for the ABCs of gaming for my baby on the way.
[15569.98 --> 15570.12]  Nice.
[15570.22 --> 15572.94]  So I love tinkering with my home server and 3d printers.
[15573.10 --> 15578.36]  Is there any tech that keeps coming back over and over to tinker with as a hobby?
[15579.40 --> 15580.24]  Water cooling.
[15580.34 --> 15583.46]  It's totally stupid and no one should use it,
[15583.64 --> 15587.40]  but I have a water cooled computer because I'm just a big idiot.
[15588.28 --> 15589.10]  I just,
[15589.28 --> 15589.66]  I just,
[15589.66 --> 15590.86]  I can't stop Luke.
[15591.40 --> 15593.50]  I just always have a water cooled computer.
[15593.66 --> 15596.30]  I don't even overclock for real.
[15596.68 --> 15596.94]  Yeah.
[15597.28 --> 15598.48]  I get no,
[15598.72 --> 15600.72]  it's in a completely separate room.
[15601.08 --> 15602.94]  It doesn't have to be quiet.
[15602.94 --> 15606.34]  Isn't it not even quiet in that room that it's in?
[15606.44 --> 15606.86]  Is it quiet?
[15606.96 --> 15607.18]  I don't know.
[15607.18 --> 15607.28]  Well,
[15607.28 --> 15608.14]  the room isn't quiet.
[15608.26 --> 15609.08]  The computer's quiet.
[15609.20 --> 15609.36]  Sure.
[15609.44 --> 15610.46]  But like the room isn't,
[15610.52 --> 15611.26]  it doesn't matter.
[15611.38 --> 15612.12]  Cause it's a loud room.
[15612.14 --> 15613.92]  It doesn't matter at all.
[15615.52 --> 15616.18]  Is this,
[15616.22 --> 15621.38]  is this purely because you want to water cool or is,
[15621.78 --> 15624.42]  how much of it is the channel and content?
[15624.72 --> 15626.04]  I'd probably do it anyway.
[15626.24 --> 15626.44]  Yeah.
[15626.62 --> 15627.52]  Cause I did it before.
[15627.70 --> 15627.92]  Yeah.
[15628.62 --> 15628.96]  I just,
[15629.08 --> 15629.68]  I don't know.
[15629.72 --> 15629.92]  I just,
[15629.98 --> 15631.34]  I have a water cooled computer.
[15631.34 --> 15631.74]  I just,
[15632.26 --> 15634.76]  I water cooled my computer cause I'm a big idiot.
[15636.34 --> 15637.48]  That's all there is to it.
[15638.66 --> 15639.40]  How about you?
[15639.66 --> 15640.62]  I don't know.
[15640.98 --> 15641.82]  Mineral oil.
[15642.56 --> 15643.84]  But it's like not though.
[15643.90 --> 15644.02]  Yeah.
[15644.02 --> 15644.70]  But where's the update?
[15645.10 --> 15645.38]  Oh,
[15646.00 --> 15651.52]  it's like kind of somewhat impossible to tell if it's okay or not.
[15651.88 --> 15652.32]  Oh,
[15652.48 --> 15652.88]  okay.
[15653.10 --> 15654.02]  That's tough then.
[15654.12 --> 15656.12]  They're like pretty sure it is okay.
[15656.12 --> 15658.06]  And they have pretty good reasons for it.
[15658.20 --> 15658.46]  Okay.
[15658.74 --> 15659.00]  I mean,
[15659.00 --> 15659.40]  that's good.
[15659.92 --> 15660.30]  Right.
[15660.30 --> 15662.34]  But they can't like be a hundred percent sure.
[15662.54 --> 15662.72]  Well,
[15662.76 --> 15665.70]  what if we just found a way to like pretty much seal it probably?
[15668.36 --> 15669.94]  So we seal in the top better.
[15670.22 --> 15674.08]  My other concern is maybe if I move,
[15674.36 --> 15676.20]  I'd be more open to it.
[15677.08 --> 15677.88]  Cause of leaks.
[15679.24 --> 15679.40]  Mm.
[15679.40 --> 15679.42]  Mm.
[15679.98 --> 15680.34]  Yeah.
[15680.34 --> 15681.06]  That's fair.
[15681.22 --> 15681.50]  Okay.
[15681.62 --> 15681.86]  Well,
[15681.96 --> 15682.44]  I can wait.
[15682.84 --> 15683.06]  Yeah.
[15683.62 --> 15683.98]  Okay.
[15683.98 --> 15687.72]  I'm on the eventually scale.
[15687.94 --> 15689.42]  I am a hundred percent down.
[15689.62 --> 15691.06]  There's a reason I still have those cases.
[15691.20 --> 15692.02]  I want to do it.
[15692.06 --> 15692.46]  Let's do it.
[15692.50 --> 15692.72]  I'm in.
[15692.72 --> 15693.00]  Okay.
[15693.10 --> 15693.36]  All right.
[15693.38 --> 15695.46]  I'm just not a hundred percent in this second.
[15695.58 --> 15697.02]  I don't know that this is the right time,
[15697.02 --> 15698.54]  but those cases are going nowhere.
[15698.92 --> 15699.46]  All right.
[15699.54 --> 15700.16]  And I'm down.
[15700.32 --> 15700.68]  Okay.
[15700.88 --> 15704.12]  And even if those cases like end up not working,
[15704.12 --> 15705.66]  like I'm down to find a way I,
[15705.76 --> 15710.50]  I have wanted to get back into oil cooling because I'm big,
[15710.56 --> 15710.98]  dumb idiot.
[15711.18 --> 15712.68]  Just like your water cooling thing.
[15713.28 --> 15716.28]  It just hasn't been the right time for a while.
[15716.94 --> 15717.34]  Um,
[15717.38 --> 15720.30]  so what would you pick as something that you do keep going back to?
[15720.92 --> 15721.28]  Well,
[15721.32 --> 15721.56]  I mean,
[15721.56 --> 15721.86]  honestly,
[15721.96 --> 15725.40]  probably that I just haven't been able to because of living situation.
[15725.56 --> 15726.14]  We'll make it happen.
[15726.24 --> 15726.86]  I've wanted to,
[15726.92 --> 15727.58]  for a long time though.
[15727.78 --> 15727.98]  I,
[15728.12 --> 15730.34]  there's a bunch of different build ideas I have for it.
[15730.42 --> 15732.10]  I've wanted a home theater one for a while,
[15732.10 --> 15734.60]  just because I think it would look sick in like a home theater set up.
[15734.86 --> 15737.42]  I also have always had this idea.
[15737.52 --> 15738.80]  I'm pretty sure I even talked to you about it.
[15738.80 --> 15741.98]  And there's probably 47 reasons why this is really stupid.
[15741.98 --> 15742.58]  It wouldn't work,
[15742.58 --> 15747.36]  but I've wanted to do a like nested tank system where there's two tanks.
[15747.62 --> 15750.82]  The outside tank is an actual fish tank with actual fish.
[15751.10 --> 15751.54]  Hey,
[15751.60 --> 15752.46]  guess who has someone,
[15752.60 --> 15754.76]  something that can make that dream a reality.
[15755.02 --> 15755.52]  So sick.
[15755.72 --> 15758.36]  I've been meaning to try and donate my fish tank to the company.
[15758.96 --> 15759.26]  Oh,
[15759.42 --> 15759.88]  this is,
[15760.06 --> 15761.42]  this would take an obsessive,
[15761.42 --> 15762.54]  like way too much work.
[15762.60 --> 15762.80]  Oh no,
[15762.84 --> 15763.46]  it could be done.
[15763.92 --> 15765.30]  So all we need is like,
[15765.34 --> 15768.40]  we need a really good temperature control system for the fish tank.
[15768.40 --> 15769.60]  Cause you don't want to cook them.
[15770.06 --> 15770.42]  Yes.
[15770.60 --> 15771.54]  Or let them die.
[15771.74 --> 15772.06]  That is,
[15772.28 --> 15774.84]  and the load of the computer is fluctuating.
[15775.38 --> 15777.12]  So what you would need is just,
[15777.18 --> 15779.56]  I think if you could just create like a,
[15779.56 --> 15782.76]  like a relay system on some kind of Pelletier heating,
[15782.76 --> 15784.14]  cooling thing,
[15784.14 --> 15786.44]  as long as it was powerful enough.
[15787.24 --> 15788.64]  To like deal with fluctuations.
[15788.64 --> 15790.06]  Cause you don't want to just,
[15790.38 --> 15790.84]  there's,
[15790.98 --> 15791.22]  there's,
[15791.32 --> 15794.44]  I'm pretty sure it's super bad for the fish for the temperature to just do
[15794.44 --> 15795.06]  this all the time.
[15795.86 --> 15796.26]  So,
[15796.44 --> 15797.24]  so that's tough.
[15797.26 --> 15798.74]  It's going to have to be pretty good.
[15799.82 --> 15800.20]  Yes.
[15800.20 --> 15801.70]  But if you have a large enough amount of water,
[15801.70 --> 15803.48]  then that shouldn't matter that much.
[15803.56 --> 15805.84]  The way that I was kind of thinking of doing it,
[15805.84 --> 15806.24]  um,
[15806.24 --> 15807.14]  um,
[15807.32 --> 15809.98]  was making sure that the,
[15810.10 --> 15811.96]  I don't know how fluctuating,
[15812.24 --> 15812.52]  whatever,
[15812.64 --> 15812.84]  whatever,
[15812.92 --> 15813.04]  whatever.
[15813.10 --> 15814.78]  I don't know much about tropical fish.
[15814.78 --> 15816.20]  I had non-tropical fish.
[15816.28 --> 15817.40]  I don't know much about tropical fish.
[15817.52 --> 15817.88]  Okay.
[15818.08 --> 15818.50]  Um,
[15818.58 --> 15822.70]  but making sure that the heating system was always pushing towards a minimum
[15822.70 --> 15827.70]  and making sure that the computer could not push it past that by itself.
[15827.70 --> 15830.38]  So the heating system is always going to have to be on,
[15830.46 --> 15831.92]  but it's onto a varying degree.
[15832.12 --> 15833.38]  I think that might be more effective.
[15833.82 --> 15835.20]  And then the other,
[15835.20 --> 15835.98]  uh,
[15835.98 --> 15838.16]  thing that I was going to bring up is leaks.
[15839.16 --> 15842.08]  Cause the fluid going into the water would be an extreme issue.
[15842.84 --> 15844.44]  Someone brought up some solution for that.
[15844.48 --> 15845.16]  I don't remember what it was.
[15845.24 --> 15847.56]  I think it was an air gap between the two.
[15848.44 --> 15850.00]  So it's not like one,
[15850.16 --> 15853.10]  one tank and then another tank in it.
[15853.16 --> 15853.44]  It's,
[15853.60 --> 15854.86]  it's almost like three.
[15856.54 --> 15856.94]  Um,
[15856.94 --> 15861.58]  because the outer tank would actually have to like seal.
[15861.58 --> 15863.18]  And then there would be a gap between,
[15863.34 --> 15864.28]  um,
[15864.48 --> 15866.06]  doing that.
[15866.06 --> 15868.48]  I think you might have issues with like,
[15868.48 --> 15869.60]  uh,
[15869.72 --> 15870.38]  like fog.
[15871.20 --> 15871.64]  Yeah.
[15872.20 --> 15873.56]  I think it could be done.
[15874.12 --> 15877.48]  It's maybe the idea has been floating there in the back of my head.
[15878.78 --> 15879.74]  It's gotta be doable.
[15880.42 --> 15882.00]  What was the exact question?
[15882.80 --> 15885.24]  Was it tech ideas or was it general?
[15885.24 --> 15886.40]  Something you tinker with that.
[15886.40 --> 15887.62]  You just kind of always come back to.
[15887.70 --> 15888.16]  I think it was tech.
[15888.46 --> 15888.76]  Okay.
[15888.86 --> 15889.42]  If it's tech,
[15889.52 --> 15889.78]  then yeah,
[15889.78 --> 15890.34]  that's my answer.
[15890.84 --> 15891.30]  All right.
[15891.54 --> 15892.78]  And my answer is,
[15893.64 --> 15895.70]  thank you very much for tuning in.
[15895.80 --> 15896.98]  We'll see you again next week.
[15897.12 --> 15897.80]  Same bad time,
[15897.94 --> 15898.70]  same bad channel.
[15899.18 --> 15905.38]  How is it that your gamer bladder is so strong that you can sit here through the entire show and I have to go to the bathroom twice?
[15905.54 --> 15906.18]  Never surrender.
[15906.46 --> 15906.74]  Mind you,
[15906.74 --> 15908.28]  I drank all of this.
[15908.52 --> 15908.66]  Yeah.
[15909.08 --> 15910.76]  I didn't drink all of this.
[15910.88 --> 15911.24]  Okay.
[15911.64 --> 15912.74]  I might be part of it.
[15912.92 --> 15913.84]  But it is pretty strong.
[15914.10 --> 15914.48]  Yeah.
[15914.64 --> 15915.28]  No kidding.
[15916.40 --> 15917.16]  Say the line,
[15917.30 --> 15917.44]  Bart.
[15918.08 --> 15918.44]  Bye.
[15918.44 --> 15918.50]  Bye.
[15918.50 --> 15918.88]  Bye.
[15918.88 --> 15919.58]  Bye.
[15919.80 --> 15920.56]  Bye.
[15920.58 --> 15920.66]  Bye.
[15920.66 --> 15920.72]  Bye.
[15920.72 --> 15922.88]  Bye.
[15922.98 --> 15925.48]  Bye.
[15925.48 --> 15925.66]  Bye.
[15925.66 --> 15927.22]  Bye.
[15927.46 --> 15927.74]  Bye.
[15927.74 --> 15927.92]  Bye.
[15927.92 --> 15928.22]  Bye.
[15928.22 --> 15928.60]  Bye.
[15928.60 --> 15928.98]  Bye.
[15934.06 --> 15934.82]  Bye.
[15934.82 --> 15934.88]  Bye.
[15934.88 --> 15935.36]  Bye.
[15935.36 --> 15935.98]  Bye.
[15935.98 --> 15936.72]  Bye.
[15936.72 --> 15966.70]  Thank you.
