[0.00 --> 3.88]  Everyone and welcome to the WAN show. We've got a great show lined up for you this week
[3.88 --> 12.48]  At least we hope we do you might have noticed that we are also live on the channel with our 24 7 LTT TV stream
[14.34 --> 17.64]  I have no idea how those two streams are going to interact with each other
[17.64 --> 22.00]  YouTube assures us that it's fine to have two live streams going from the same channel at the same time
[22.62 --> 26.90]  We currently do. I just loaded it up. What I suspect is that basically
[26.90 --> 32.80]  Nobody is going to watch WAN show and they're gonna be like WTF? What the heck happened to WAN show and we're gonna be like
[33.18 --> 38.84]  This happened to WAN show got a lot of great topics for you guys today. The big ones are of course
[39.60 --> 42.04]  threads launching this is a new
[42.42 --> 46.76]  Twitter alike from meta parent company of Facebook and Instagram and
[48.70 --> 51.78]  Elon Musk was salty he was a salty baby
[51.78 --> 60.06]  Ooh, but that's not really what we think is the biggest news Google has been accused of misleading advertisers
[60.06 --> 63.00]  Which when your entire business is advertising?
[64.54 --> 69.08]  Basically amounts to your business being like kind of fraudy
[69.82 --> 76.78]  Allegedly allegedly so these are serious accusations. We're gonna be digging into them a little bit later. What else we got today?
[76.78 --> 78.78]  uh, we have
[80.42 --> 82.42]  Tons of great topics
[82.88 --> 89.70]  Seriously, you're not the one you submitted that has an entire page of notes. You're not gonna go with that. Okay. Yeah, sure
[89.70 --> 98.74]  Why not the CEO of a alleged rug pull game is suing goat moth a creator that we've mentioned a couple times on WAN show in the past for his
[99.44 --> 103.48]  Exposes of cheating in Tarkov. So that'll be a little spicy
[103.48 --> 105.58]  We'll talk about that in the moment and the next one
[105.58 --> 111.76]  I can't decide between the end of giphy cat and the fact that apparently emojis can quite literally be legally binding
[111.98 --> 113.98]  You picked those over
[114.34 --> 119.00]  EVGA potentially going out of business a potential allegedly maybe maybe maybe that's true
[133.48 --> 144.18]  The show is brought to you today by blackpoint cyber square space and signal wire
[145.46 --> 148.26]  Okay, right into threads are right into Google. Oh
[148.90 --> 154.52]  You can actually just choose this time. Yes, the title was kind of both. Yeah, which one do you want to do?
[154.52 --> 159.94]  I said you had a lot to say about threads. I did I just have some claims to make okay
[159.94 --> 164.58]  You know what some gotchas no, I want to do Google accused of misleading advertisers
[164.82 --> 172.90]  Yeah, Google has been accused of misleading advertisers about their true view in stream ads and this is according to
[173.52 --> 175.52]  advertising research firm ad
[175.86 --> 177.86]  analytics analytics excuse me
[177.86 --> 184.62]  So for those of you who are unfamiliar true view ads can be skipped after five seconds and
[185.38 --> 189.82]  Advertisers hence the name true view right it's supposed to be an actual view
[190.46 --> 195.40]  Advertisers are only supposed to be charged for them if the consumer watches
[195.52 --> 202.90]  30 seconds of the ad or if it's shorter than that the entire ad with audio playing
[202.90 --> 206.84]  The ads are supposed to be in stream which means they play before
[207.52 --> 214.04]  During or after video content now when you think of Google services that have video content
[214.04 --> 216.04]  What's the first thing that comes to mind?
[216.78 --> 223.24]  YouTube I thought you were gonna go with something snarky like like duo video calling or something
[223.78 --> 225.78]  Yeah, exactly. Thank you for that
[226.20 --> 228.20]  Yeah, YouTube but
[228.20 --> 230.20]  analytics found that
[230.82 --> 234.16]  42 to 75% of
[234.72 --> 238.30]  True view ad spend was allocated to ads that did not
[239.24 --> 248.94]  Meet Google's claimed standards the firm reviewed the ad campaigns of over a thousand brands across the internet and found that many of the true view ads
[249.20 --> 257.14]  Were run not only in small video players that are were just in the corner or the side of the screen
[257.14 --> 259.14]  Some of which were fully muted
[259.14 --> 265.98]  But in some cases on sites that contained content that would violate you Google's terms of service
[268.02 --> 270.06]  This is a huge deal because
[271.04 --> 274.56]  Have you ever bought online advertising before?
[275.60 --> 278.40]  Technically yes, it was a very long time ago, but yes
[278.40 --> 280.40]  There is a high degree of trust
[280.40 --> 286.96]  Trust associated with it. Absolutely. I don't know if you guys have done this before but I've done it a couple of times and
[287.86 --> 293.78]  Basically what you do is you kind of pick what you want the most recent time?
[293.78 --> 296.96]  I did it was on Facebook, but I'm sure the process is relatively similar
[296.96 --> 305.30]  Yeah, you you kind of pick what you want to target you choose what you want it to say and obviously like where you want it to direct to if anybody clicks on it
[305.30 --> 311.06]  And then you set a budget and it's basically on them to decide
[311.76 --> 317.86]  Algorithmically right spend it where where to spend the budget and in some cases you don't even set an exact budget
[318.22 --> 323.08]  so sometimes they will spend less or they'll spend more and
[323.86 --> 329.50]  There's just the expectation that you're going to trust that they're gonna spend it in a way that is
[330.72 --> 331.72]  algorithmically
[331.72 --> 338.18]  Optimal because well, otherwise I guess you could take your business elsewhere except that you know online advertising
[338.18 --> 343.70]  Is essentially what I do a poly at this point is there another major player outside of meta and Google?
[345.14 --> 351.96]  Nowhere near the same scale it functionally functionally not really yeah, and so if Google is saying hey
[352.44 --> 358.04]  This is going to be played on content that is verified brand safe on
[358.04 --> 362.80]  On sites that are controlled by us like when they say true view ad I
[363.80 --> 368.50]  Had never even heard of those running anywhere other than on YouTube high expectations
[368.50 --> 375.54]  But you know what's funny is as soon as I saw the article about this as soon as I saw the report I went
[376.74 --> 379.68]  Yeah, I have seen the five second
[380.40 --> 387.06]  Countdown on other to skip on other side you saw an ad I had always just I don't know what the ad was for
[388.04 --> 392.02]  I saw the skip I saw skip button for an ad fair enough
[392.88 --> 398.58]  But I always just kind of assumed that it was someone cloning Google's interface because that happens all the time
[399.12 --> 402.04]  Yeah, you'll see something that looks like a recapture
[402.48 --> 409.98]  But it isn't or you'll see something that looks like you know ad choices or whatever, but it is something else. Yeah, yeah
[409.98 --> 411.98]  Um
[411.98 --> 417.98]  The research and and and to defend that assumption there are players that have done that for
[418.86 --> 420.94]  Advertisements that are not Google ads, right?
[420.94 --> 426.14]  They have the five-second skip it's in the same spot the box looks almost identical and I guarantee you it's not a true view ad
[426.14 --> 428.14]  So like that was a decent assumption
[428.14 --> 433.20]  The research also identified ads in which the skip button was hidden or
[433.86 --> 441.30]  Obscured to make it difficult for users to skip after five seconds, which means Google was basically
[442.88 --> 446.98]  Just like I mean if this is true
[447.32 --> 450.48]  Google was fraudulently charging their advertisers
[450.48 --> 456.14]  For ads that were supposed to be seen by a pair of human eyeballs
[456.44 --> 461.10]  But probably never were which you might not actually necessarily care about
[461.44 --> 468.80]  But if this goes through legal action and it's true that 70 up to 75 percent of these were screwed
[469.30 --> 473.86]  That might impact YouTube or Google in it. I can actually very significant way
[474.52 --> 479.86]  Which you know they have coming if this is if this is true
[479.86 --> 486.80]  Yeah, but man this this raises some serious questions about the viability of Google's platforms
[487.64 --> 489.96]  Like if this is what they have to do
[490.76 --> 498.50]  To make money. I'm sitting here going is YouTube even is YouTube even less sustainable than I thought it was
[499.14 --> 501.00]  because I I kind of I
[501.84 --> 506.94]  Don't know man like just looking at the sheer volume not just of viewers on YouTube
[506.94 --> 510.76]  But but ad consumption on YouTube like it's kind of
[511.90 --> 514.40]  I wonder if it's actually almost reverse
[515.40 --> 518.12]  Really sorry because if you put these
[518.80 --> 526.64]  Ads on these random websites where they're like out of the corner and then you're selling like the effectiveness of these ads
[526.64 --> 531.68]  Yeah, versus YouTube ads. I feel like they would be more effective when they're on YouTube. Well, that's true
[531.68 --> 533.68]  But I feel like they're taking more volume
[533.82 --> 538.48]  But the effectiveness is probably going down probably comes out in the wash as a positive for them
[538.48 --> 544.80]  But YouTube might actually do better if you're able to buy an ad that was specifically only on YouTube interesting
[545.58 --> 549.96]  Yeah, yeah, so then they have less inventory but theoretically
[550.18 --> 556.22]  They can charge more of a premium for it because it will drive better conversion. So that's screwing you over
[556.22 --> 558.22]  Um
[558.22 --> 564.10]  No, because it actually benefits me directly if CPMs are higher on YouTube. That's what I'm saying. Oh
[564.10 --> 567.28]  Oh by doing this. Yeah. Hey, yeah, we're
[569.22 --> 577.68]  By doing the volume decreased value model yeah by using a bunch of junk sites to pump the volume my piece of this you're getting screwed and
[578.76 --> 586.02]  By extension everyone else in this building. Yeah, that's that's that's line is really group incorporated its revenue
[586.02 --> 588.92]  Yeah, hold on hold on a second Google gets worse
[589.48 --> 596.14]  Other ads were reported appearing in Android apps that were not even available in the Google Play Store
[597.34 --> 602.10]  Including from developers based in countries that are sanctioned by the US government such as Iran
[603.22 --> 608.78]  By the way small update seems to at least somewhat be working. There's currently six point four thousand on YouTube watching land
[608.78 --> 611.10]  Okay, so I guess two live streams
[612.22 --> 615.82]  Double the fun. Yeah, cool. I don't know that and 30% more fun
[615.82 --> 618.66]  There is notably less people watching the 24 7 stream
[619.70 --> 622.44]  Okay, well, that's fine. Yeah, they don't need to watch that
[623.24 --> 624.24]  um now
[624.92 --> 627.08]  Google is not just gonna take this lying down
[627.68 --> 630.48]  Google's director of global video solutions mark
[631.04 --> 636.06]  Excuse me mark marvin renaud wrote that the reports findings are and this is in quotes
[637.10 --> 639.10]  extremely inaccurate
[639.10 --> 646.02]  Advertisers are only charged for ads when they are viewed and that the majority of ads are served on YouTube
[646.52 --> 648.02]  Not on third-party sites
[648.02 --> 657.30]  He likewise said that Google monitors adherence to its policies and last year stopped serving ads on over a hundred forty three thousand websites that were found to be in violation
[657.30 --> 664.72]  Renaud's blog post also claims that Google allows advertisers to opt out of running ads on third-party sites at any time
[665.24 --> 670.14]  However, this is actually contradicted by Google support page that reads as of September 30th 2021
[670.14 --> 676.04]  New video action campaigns that you create in Google Ads use Google video partners automatically
[676.04 --> 680.20]  So you are getting screwed
[680.20 --> 681.68]  I mean
[681.68 --> 686.88]  What's what's really interesting is this isn't in our notes, but it was in one of the articles that I read about this
[686.88 --> 694.30]  Apparently since 2016 there's been less transparency in terms of like something to do with the way that your campaign runs
[694.30 --> 695.38]  I don't want to say anything
[695.38 --> 696.66]  uh, because I
[696.66 --> 703.04]  Don't get the exact details wrong because it's just based on memory for an article I read like three or four hours ago, but um
[703.04 --> 706.38]  Man
[706.38 --> 714.88]  I uh, I will be keeping an extremely extremely close eye on this over the next little bit because this is kind of a bombshell
[714.88 --> 716.94]  like we're not just talking about
[716.94 --> 723.52]  Millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars. We could be talking about billions of dollars
[723.52 --> 725.52]  I also saw a list of the
[725.52 --> 729.46]  Of the brands that were allegedly affected by this
[729.46 --> 734.34]  Uh, let me see if the verge has the original adlytic. Yeah, here it is
[734.34 --> 737.46]  Uh, so here's the original article from adlytics
[737.46 --> 741.22]  Uh, but the YouTube channel valid true view
[741.22 --> 744.18]  Uh, web page valid true view
[744.18 --> 744.80]  Uh-huh
[744.80 --> 747.62]  Invalid true view whoops
[747.62 --> 750.80]  Uh, here's an American Express
[750.80 --> 752.68]  So they've actually got like they've got receipts
[752.68 --> 757.26]  American Express YouTube true view ad serving on a third-party website
[757.26 --> 760.68]  What the heck is the news lens? I've never heard of this before
[760.68 --> 765.66]  Uh, video player is muted by default video ads autoplay without consumer initiation
[765.66 --> 770.64]  Uh, here's another one. Uh, jpmorgan chase youtube true view ad
[770.64 --> 774.96]  Just like casually sitting here on whatever the site is
[774.96 --> 777.36]  Uh, multiple
[777.36 --> 781.64]  Kayak youtube true view ads playing in different ad slots
[781.64 --> 783.68]  I wonder how much of this is like
[783.68 --> 786.14]  Text-based websites
[786.14 --> 791.78]  Abusing how the like player works and stuff like that to try to like trick it into giving them more ads
[791.78 --> 794.58]  Because that is we've seen that strategy for years
[794.58 --> 796.72]  Mmm, that's possible
[796.72 --> 798.72]  So google might need to step up
[798.72 --> 802.36]  Like they're like, oh we we blocked 143 000 websites
[802.36 --> 803.98]  Like maybe you should do more
[803.98 --> 806.48]  So like that website sounds like a lot in a vacuum
[806.48 --> 809.02]  Or sorry that amount of website sounds like a lot in a vacuum
[809.02 --> 810.22]  But it might not actually be that much
[810.22 --> 811.16]  Man
[811.16 --> 812.68]  Um
[812.68 --> 814.36]  Yeah
[814.36 --> 819.00]  So it's not like they're just coming out of nowhere saying this
[819.00 --> 820.52]  But google says it's not true
[820.52 --> 821.16]  I
[821.16 --> 822.36]  Of course they do though
[822.36 --> 822.70]  Like
[822.70 --> 824.36]  I will be very interested
[824.36 --> 825.14]  Well, okay fine
[825.14 --> 827.46]  Do you want to jump into our our next topic then?
[828.10 --> 828.30]  Sure
[828.30 --> 829.82]  Allegedly
[829.82 --> 834.74]  This is according to a recent forum post from korean overclocker safe disk
[834.74 --> 839.50]  The entire evga motherboard team in taiwan has resigned
[839.50 --> 843.64]  Which could force the company to leave the motherboard market
[843.64 --> 846.86]  However, this is very contested
[846.86 --> 850.34]  In fact, I personally reached out to evga
[850.34 --> 854.82]  And you can go ahead and read the response for the good people here
[854.82 --> 856.54]  Just the big one at the bottom
[856.54 --> 856.80]  Yeah
[856.80 --> 859.50]  All rumor kingpin still with evga
[859.50 --> 861.36]  Still focus on other product lines
[861.36 --> 863.00]  And taiwan office still open
[863.00 --> 864.16]  Here to support our customers
[864.16 --> 866.32]  Now what's curious is that
[866.32 --> 868.68]  While there has been some speculation
[868.68 --> 870.44]  That the
[870.44 --> 873.10]  That the the taiwan office is closing
[873.10 --> 875.74]  And that or that kingpin is leaving evga
[875.74 --> 878.70]  And this is based on an offhand remark
[878.70 --> 881.28]  He made in an interview with gamers nexus
[881.28 --> 883.48]  Where he basically was asked
[883.48 --> 884.56]  What's your next big project?
[884.68 --> 885.54]  And he said nothing
[885.54 --> 885.94]  Yeah
[885.94 --> 887.04]  Um
[887.04 --> 892.26]  The one thing that evga's message doesn't contest
[892.26 --> 894.46]  Is the motherboard team
[894.46 --> 894.90]  Yes
[894.90 --> 896.62]  And if kingpin said
[896.62 --> 898.22]  I don't have any other projects
[898.22 --> 899.98]  That doesn't necessarily mean that he's leaving
[899.98 --> 901.04]  So all he said is
[901.04 --> 903.00]  Vince is still there
[903.00 --> 905.76]  But that doesn't necessarily mean he has any projects
[905.76 --> 906.82]  With the motherboard team
[906.82 --> 907.54]  If
[907.54 --> 909.12]  They're gone
[909.12 --> 909.56]  So
[909.56 --> 911.26]  He might have also interpreted it as like
[911.26 --> 913.84]  What is your next project within this team?
[914.62 --> 915.64]  Because if I remember correctly
[915.64 --> 917.32]  He like looks at the other guy and says
[917.32 --> 918.24]  Nothing
[918.24 --> 918.96]  Or something
[918.96 --> 919.46]  I don't remember
[919.46 --> 919.80]  Yeah
[919.80 --> 920.96]  I don't have it right in front of me
[920.96 --> 921.28]  I don't know
[921.28 --> 922.06]  But yeah
[922.06 --> 925.24]  Workers at evga Spain told tech power up
[925.24 --> 927.18]  That it was business as usual at their branch
[927.18 --> 930.62]  And evga has denied accounts of mass resignations
[930.62 --> 933.30]  And leaving the motherboard market to both tech power up
[933.30 --> 934.56]  Oh and apparently to us as well
[934.56 --> 936.24]  So this didn't contain a denial of that
[936.24 --> 937.74]  But maybe to someone else here
[937.74 --> 940.46]  Part of what made these rumors seem plausible though
[940.46 --> 943.36]  Is that it's only been a year since evga announced
[943.36 --> 945.10]  It was leaving the gpu market
[945.10 --> 947.88]  And some forum users have noted that the company's
[947.88 --> 949.78]  Supernova xc power supplies
[949.78 --> 951.98]  Come with only a three year warranty
[951.98 --> 954.18]  Which is two to seven years shorter
[954.18 --> 956.36]  Than what is usual for evga
[956.36 --> 958.94]  Dun dun dun
[958.94 --> 964.82]  I also noticed completely independent of this
[964.82 --> 967.04]  That evga's site
[967.04 --> 969.78]  Has basically nothing in stock
[969.78 --> 970.94]  Interesting
[970.94 --> 972.56]  And the reason for this is that
[972.56 --> 975.16]  We have an upcoming budget power supply roundup
[975.16 --> 976.62]  I know right
[976.62 --> 978.32]  We're doing a budget power supply roundup
[978.32 --> 979.06]  Can you believe it?
[979.40 --> 981.12]  The power supply tester is up and running
[981.12 --> 981.62]  Hey
[981.62 --> 981.96]  Yeah
[981.96 --> 982.88]  So anyway
[982.88 --> 986.46]  The winner was an evga power supply
[986.46 --> 988.48]  We'll get that video out to you guys
[988.48 --> 990.30]  As soon as it's through the editing pipeline
[990.30 --> 994.06]  But what I realized was that it wasn't available anywhere
[994.06 --> 997.24]  So in the time between a few weeks ago
[997.24 --> 998.62]  Us buying it
[998.62 --> 999.62]  And testing it
[999.62 --> 1000.16]  And testing it
[1000.16 --> 1002.52]  And sitting down to review the script with Alex
[1002.52 --> 1005.04]  It had completely disappeared from the internet
[1005.04 --> 1008.78]  It wasn't available at any of the major retailers you would expect to find it at
[1008.78 --> 1011.80]  And it wasn't even listed on evga's website
[1011.80 --> 1014.46]  I then started going through evga's site
[1014.46 --> 1016.34]  Which it looks like you're doing
[1016.34 --> 1017.68]  Don't look at gpus though
[1017.68 --> 1018.46]  They're out of that market
[1018.46 --> 1019.74]  Just power supplies
[1019.74 --> 1022.34]  I started going through evga's site
[1022.34 --> 1025.04]  And what I realized was
[1025.04 --> 1028.08]  They don't have a single power supply in stock
[1028.08 --> 1029.58]  Seriously, click on anything
[1029.58 --> 1033.34]  Wow
[1033.34 --> 1035.76]  So I called them
[1035.76 --> 1037.10]  Because I was like
[1037.10 --> 1038.76]  Hey, this is going to be pretty embarrassing
[1038.76 --> 1041.26]  If we, you know, do a
[1041.26 --> 1043.46]  It's a small roundup
[1043.46 --> 1045.82]  The process is very manual right now
[1045.82 --> 1047.66]  That we tested five power supplies
[1047.66 --> 1049.62]  Only three of which were actually really budget
[1049.62 --> 1051.94]  Because all we wanted was a good recommendation
[1051.94 --> 1054.60]  And we basically stopped as soon as we got there
[1054.60 --> 1057.20]  Because it is inordinately time consuming
[1057.20 --> 1059.64]  And there's a lot for us to figure out in our workflow
[1059.64 --> 1060.90]  Which we will
[1060.90 --> 1062.88]  But this was just a good test run, basically
[1062.88 --> 1065.32]  So the only things they have in stock on their website are b-stock
[1065.32 --> 1066.42]  There is b-stock
[1066.42 --> 1068.18]  But it's only b-stock
[1068.18 --> 1069.84]  So it would be pretty embarrassing
[1069.84 --> 1073.08]  If the winner of our roundup of three items
[1073.08 --> 1074.84]  Didn't exist anymore
[1074.84 --> 1076.88]  So I called up evga and I went
[1076.88 --> 1078.52]  Hey, what's going on?
[1078.56 --> 1081.50]  Do you still make budget power supplies?
[1081.70 --> 1083.32]  Also, like, are you going to have any stock?
[1083.46 --> 1084.38]  What's the deal here?
[1084.72 --> 1087.08]  And I was assured that there is inventory incoming
[1087.08 --> 1089.28]  And that, like, it will
[1089.28 --> 1092.10]  It might be a little while after the video comes out
[1092.10 --> 1093.34]  Before you can actually buy one
[1093.34 --> 1095.38]  But there are more coming and you will be able to buy one
[1095.38 --> 1101.32]  So I had already had some questions
[1101.32 --> 1103.66]  About what was going on over at EVGA
[1103.66 --> 1105.54]  Because even if they do have more power supplies coming
[1105.54 --> 1107.86]  That doesn't mean necessarily that things are going great
[1107.86 --> 1110.70]  If there's nothing in stock on their site
[1110.70 --> 1112.44]  Yeah, no motherboards
[1112.44 --> 1113.72]  Outside of b-stock
[1113.72 --> 1116.16]  No motherboards and no power supplies in stock at all
[1116.16 --> 1119.02]  Is a little fishy
[1119.02 --> 1122.24]  With that said, there were some power supplies in stock at third parties
[1122.24 --> 1126.72]  And my understanding is that EVGA stocks their site
[1126.72 --> 1128.56]  Before retailer sites
[1128.56 --> 1130.20]  Oh, wait, do you mean the other way around?
[1130.34 --> 1131.40]  Excuse me, I mean the other way around
[1131.40 --> 1134.32]  They stock partner sites before their own site
[1134.32 --> 1136.36]  But I am
[1136.36 --> 1142.02]  I don't consider this matter to be entirely resolved
[1142.02 --> 1143.02]  Yeah
[1143.02 --> 1146.44]  Is what I will say about all of this
[1146.44 --> 1147.78]  Yeah, a little sketchy
[1147.78 --> 1148.12]  Yeah
[1148.12 --> 1151.24]  Hey, you can also buy a lanyard
[1151.24 --> 1152.74]  They have those
[1152.74 --> 1153.26]  At EVGA
[1153.26 --> 1154.78]  Okay, thank you, Luke
[1154.78 --> 1155.20]  That is
[1155.20 --> 1155.94]  Very cool
[1155.94 --> 1156.84]  Very helpful
[1156.84 --> 1157.76]  And a mouse badge
[1157.76 --> 1160.56]  I mean, don't forget about the case badge
[1160.56 --> 1162.12]  The metal case badge for a dollar?
[1163.38 --> 1163.98]  That's not too bad
[1163.98 --> 1165.56]  As long as you don't want to buy more than 15
[1165.56 --> 1169.40]  Start melting them down
[1169.40 --> 1170.40]  That would be a problem
[1170.40 --> 1175.08]  Hold on, guys
[1175.08 --> 1177.04]  We've only got like three things left in stock
[1177.04 --> 1178.40]  15 per person maximum
[1178.40 --> 1179.66]  We don't want to completely run out
[1179.66 --> 1181.60]  That would be embarrassing
[1181.60 --> 1185.96]  All right, why don't we jump
[1185.96 --> 1186.92]  Speaking of embarrassing
[1186.92 --> 1187.50]  Yeah
[1187.50 --> 1189.22]  Uh, Threads
[1189.22 --> 1190.34]  Yeah
[1190.34 --> 1191.38]  Threads has been launched
[1191.38 --> 1193.36]  Meta's new Twitter competitor, Threads
[1193.36 --> 1196.56]  Has reportedly accumulated over 30 million users
[1196.56 --> 1197.98]  Within its first 24 hours
[1197.98 --> 1200.02]  The app is not entirely polished
[1200.02 --> 1202.98]  And lacks support for both emojis and hashtags
[1202.98 --> 1204.30]  Quick update to that number
[1204.30 --> 1206.62]  It's apparently over 78 million now
[1206.62 --> 1207.74]  Cool
[1207.74 --> 1212.42]  Uh, there is no dedicated chronological following feed
[1212.42 --> 1213.94]  Though one is planned
[1213.94 --> 1215.80]  I'm sure hashtags and emojis will be as well
[1215.80 --> 1218.48]  Uh, the app requires an Instagram account to join
[1218.48 --> 1221.36]  And offers new users the option to follow everyone
[1221.36 --> 1222.48]  They already follow on Instagram
[1222.48 --> 1226.22]  There is currently no method of deleting the Threads account
[1226.22 --> 1229.02]  Without also deleting the attached Instagram account
[1229.02 --> 1232.18]  Though they can be independently deactivated
[1232.18 --> 1232.96]  Whatever that means
[1232.96 --> 1234.92]  I, yeah, I don't fully know
[1234.92 --> 1236.68]  I think it means your data's not gone
[1236.68 --> 1237.52]  But like
[1237.52 --> 1241.70]  You can't log into it anymore?
[1241.86 --> 1242.42]  I don't know
[1242.42 --> 1242.86]  Okay
[1242.86 --> 1246.90]  Um, this may violate a consent decree
[1246.90 --> 1248.90]  Placed by Meta by the FCC
[1248.90 --> 1250.86]  Because it misleads the user
[1250.86 --> 1253.30]  About the degree to which they can control their own data
[1253.30 --> 1255.52]  Alright, some of this stuff's getting into the weeds a little bit
[1255.52 --> 1256.08]  Can we just
[1256.08 --> 1258.48]  Can we just sort of generally talk about
[1258.48 --> 1259.30]  Just mean for a sec?
[1259.42 --> 1261.10]  How utterly remarkable it is
[1261.10 --> 1266.00]  That Elon Musk has gone from being the technology industry's poster boy
[1266.00 --> 1267.78]  For how to be like a
[1267.78 --> 1270.64]  An awesome, you know, billionaire innovator
[1270.64 --> 1272.48]  To being so hated
[1272.48 --> 1277.04]  That people are actually cheering for Mark Zuckerberg
[1277.04 --> 1278.32]  Yeah, yeah
[1278.32 --> 1279.46]  In multiple ways
[1279.46 --> 1280.94]  Because they also want him to fight
[1280.94 --> 1281.92]  In like two years
[1281.92 --> 1283.90]  That's how long
[1283.90 --> 1286.60]  That's how long that fall from grace took
[1286.60 --> 1287.26]  I just want to say
[1287.26 --> 1288.70]  I've been pointing out for a long time
[1288.70 --> 1290.64]  I don't think it would be that hard to make a Twitter competitor
[1290.64 --> 1292.68]  And people keep on telling me that I'm nuts
[1292.68 --> 1295.06]  They've only been working on this since like January
[1295.06 --> 1300.40]  They have over 70 million users
[1300.40 --> 1302.38]  I mean
[1302.38 --> 1305.52]  I think it was kind of a really smart move
[1305.52 --> 1306.20]  Like I'm annoyed
[1306.20 --> 1307.78]  I don't have a Threads account
[1307.78 --> 1310.88]  Because I actually do not have an Instagram account
[1310.88 --> 1312.38]  Because I just
[1312.38 --> 1314.58]  I had the work one
[1314.58 --> 1317.26]  And I used that as my Instagram account
[1317.26 --> 1317.64]  Oh yeah, yeah
[1317.64 --> 1319.82]  So when you did your split thing back in the day
[1319.82 --> 1320.78]  You just didn't make an Instagram account?
[1320.78 --> 1322.62]  I just didn't bother making an Instagram account
[1322.62 --> 1323.58]  Because I'm sitting here going
[1323.58 --> 1324.54]  Well, what is Instagram?
[1325.12 --> 1325.32]  Yeah
[1325.32 --> 1326.68]  It's Twitter
[1326.68 --> 1328.32]  I think I uploaded a picture to Instagram
[1328.32 --> 1329.24]  Like three years ago
[1329.24 --> 1330.58]  And I was on a hike
[1330.58 --> 1331.78]  And it was just a picture of the burrito
[1331.78 --> 1333.08]  That I was eating while I was on the hike
[1333.08 --> 1335.46]  Yeah, that should have been a tweet for sure
[1335.46 --> 1336.90]  That's actual garbage content
[1336.90 --> 1337.20]  Yeah
[1337.20 --> 1339.28]  And so I just
[1339.28 --> 1341.24]  I didn't really understand the point of Instagram
[1341.24 --> 1341.74]  And like
[1341.74 --> 1344.50]  Our former cinematographer Brandon
[1344.50 --> 1345.60]  Tried to explain it to me
[1345.60 --> 1346.06]  He was like
[1346.06 --> 1347.72]  It's like better
[1347.72 --> 1348.90]  And I was like
[1348.90 --> 1350.08]  What does that even mean?
[1350.16 --> 1350.52]  He's like
[1350.52 --> 1351.38]  When you're scrolling
[1351.38 --> 1351.90]  It's better
[1351.90 --> 1352.82]  And I'm like
[1352.82 --> 1354.44]  I'm sorry
[1354.44 --> 1355.06]  I actually have
[1355.06 --> 1356.72]  I actually have no capacity
[1356.72 --> 1359.26]  To understand what you're talking about right now
[1359.26 --> 1360.74]  And I'm not going to scroll either of them
[1360.74 --> 1361.70]  So it doesn't really matter
[1361.70 --> 1365.68]  So anyway
[1365.68 --> 1367.18]  I don't have an Instagram account
[1367.18 --> 1369.06]  And I just
[1369.06 --> 1370.60]  It was like
[1370.60 --> 1371.74]  It took longer than
[1371.74 --> 1372.88]  Like three seconds
[1372.88 --> 1373.68]  To
[1373.68 --> 1375.76]  You know
[1375.76 --> 1377.38]  I would have had to log into my
[1377.38 --> 1378.94]  Password manager
[1378.94 --> 1380.42]  In order to
[1380.42 --> 1380.70]  You know
[1380.70 --> 1382.34]  Validate my login with Facebook
[1382.34 --> 1382.98]  Or something
[1382.98 --> 1383.30]  Something
[1383.30 --> 1383.98]  And I was just like
[1383.98 --> 1384.60]  Ah
[1384.60 --> 1385.98]  Forget it
[1385.98 --> 1386.54]  But
[1386.54 --> 1388.12]  To their credit
[1388.12 --> 1389.90]  I think it was kind of genius
[1389.90 --> 1391.72]  To tie the branding
[1391.72 --> 1392.94]  And everything into Instagram
[1392.94 --> 1393.62]  Instead of
[1393.62 --> 1394.44]  Gives you more confidence
[1394.44 --> 1395.48]  Instead of calling it
[1395.48 --> 1396.46]  Threads by Facebook
[1396.46 --> 1397.70]  Or something like that
[1397.70 --> 1398.36]  Oh yeah
[1398.36 --> 1399.10]  No definitely
[1399.10 --> 1400.78]  Because the brand cachet
[1400.78 --> 1402.56]  Of Instagram
[1402.56 --> 1403.66]  Is obviously
[1403.66 --> 1404.00]  You know
[1404.00 --> 1404.86]  Way better than
[1404.86 --> 1405.96]  Boomer Facebook
[1405.96 --> 1406.62]  Or whatever
[1406.62 --> 1408.52]  And what's kind of
[1408.52 --> 1410.48]  Interesting about this
[1410.48 --> 1412.04]  Is I feel like
[1412.04 --> 1413.02]  What they're doing
[1413.02 --> 1414.34]  Is they are
[1414.34 --> 1415.60]  Acknowledging
[1415.60 --> 1417.38]  Indirectly
[1417.38 --> 1419.92]  That every social media platform
[1419.92 --> 1420.92]  Kind of has
[1420.92 --> 1421.38]  A
[1421.38 --> 1422.98]  A cycle
[1422.98 --> 1424.46]  I think they've just
[1424.46 --> 1425.80]  Accepted at this point
[1425.80 --> 1426.56]  And this is something
[1426.56 --> 1428.02]  I didn't really catch on to
[1428.02 --> 1429.44]  When they rebranded to Meta
[1429.44 --> 1431.48]  I think they have accepted
[1431.48 --> 1432.20]  At this point
[1432.20 --> 1433.68]  That the Facebook brand
[1433.68 --> 1434.74]  Is basically
[1434.74 --> 1435.16]  Like
[1435.16 --> 1436.18]  Just f***ing done
[1436.18 --> 1436.60]  Yeah
[1436.60 --> 1438.06]  It's annihilated
[1438.06 --> 1439.46]  There's nothing left of it
[1439.46 --> 1441.04]  So they are slowly
[1441.04 --> 1441.90]  But surely
[1441.90 --> 1443.08]  Just kind of going
[1443.08 --> 1443.52]  Okay
[1443.52 --> 1444.02]  Well
[1444.02 --> 1445.14]  I don't know
[1445.14 --> 1446.36]  Use it for Marketplace
[1446.36 --> 1446.88]  Or whatever
[1446.88 --> 1448.76]  We'll happily take your data
[1448.76 --> 1449.80]  About what you're selling
[1449.80 --> 1450.28]  And buying
[1450.28 --> 1451.26]  In the second hand
[1451.26 --> 1451.68]  Or whatever
[1451.68 --> 1452.64]  And if
[1452.64 --> 1454.62]  People want to post
[1454.62 --> 1455.46]  Pictures of their
[1455.46 --> 1457.06]  Family outing
[1457.06 --> 1457.44]  Or whatever
[1457.44 --> 1458.02]  On Facebook
[1458.02 --> 1459.18]  And they can like it
[1459.18 --> 1459.50]  Or whatever
[1459.50 --> 1459.94]  Sure fine
[1459.94 --> 1460.50]  Go do that
[1460.50 --> 1461.50]  But we understand
[1461.50 --> 1462.62]  Everything's moving to Instagram
[1462.62 --> 1463.70]  And we understand
[1463.70 --> 1464.76]  Instagram ain't going to be
[1464.76 --> 1465.80]  Around forever either
[1465.80 --> 1466.74]  And so
[1466.74 --> 1467.76]  By migrating
[1467.76 --> 1468.86]  Remember
[1468.86 --> 1470.12]  The Instagram branding
[1470.12 --> 1470.90]  Changed to
[1470.90 --> 1472.10]  Instagram by Facebook
[1472.10 --> 1473.56]  For a long time there
[1473.56 --> 1474.20]  Build
[1474.20 --> 1474.48]  Build
[1474.48 --> 1474.78]  Build
[1474.78 --> 1475.06]  Build
[1475.06 --> 1475.28]  Build
[1475.28 --> 1475.90]  Okay
[1475.90 --> 1477.22]  This is threads
[1477.22 --> 1477.88]  By Instagram
[1477.88 --> 1479.80]  And then they migrate
[1479.80 --> 1480.78]  A bunch of people
[1480.78 --> 1481.52]  Who are interested
[1481.52 --> 1482.08]  In changing
[1482.08 --> 1482.80]  Like that's the thing
[1482.80 --> 1483.44]  Is I'm getting
[1483.44 --> 1484.38]  To be all boomery
[1484.38 --> 1485.52]  Like I don't
[1485.52 --> 1486.06]  I just
[1486.06 --> 1486.84]  Why do I
[1486.84 --> 1487.50]  Why do I still
[1487.50 --> 1488.40]  Use Twitter at all
[1488.40 --> 1489.70]  Honestly
[1489.70 --> 1490.84]  Just like out of habit
[1490.84 --> 1491.24]  Yeah
[1491.24 --> 1491.64]  Whereas
[1491.64 --> 1493.96]  It tends to be
[1493.96 --> 1494.94]  People who have
[1494.94 --> 1496.72]  A little bit more time
[1496.72 --> 1497.42]  A little bit more
[1497.42 --> 1498.64]  Elasticity left
[1498.64 --> 1499.40]  In their brains
[1499.40 --> 1500.08]  That are just going to
[1500.08 --> 1500.74]  Try to jump onto
[1500.74 --> 1501.20]  Something new
[1501.20 --> 1501.84]  Just for the sake
[1501.84 --> 1502.54]  Of trying it
[1502.54 --> 1503.90]  So they jump onto
[1503.90 --> 1504.18]  Threads
[1504.18 --> 1505.04]  It's going to naturally
[1505.04 --> 1505.68]  Have a younger
[1505.68 --> 1506.46]  More vibrant
[1506.46 --> 1507.46]  User base
[1507.46 --> 1509.58]  And eventually
[1509.58 --> 1510.48]  Instagram will turn
[1510.48 --> 1511.02]  Into like
[1511.02 --> 1512.38]  For you know
[1512.38 --> 1513.04]  Millennials
[1513.04 --> 1513.58]  Or you know
[1513.58 --> 1514.84]  Geriatric Gen Z's
[1514.84 --> 1515.26]  Or whatever
[1515.26 --> 1516.16]  And this is going to be
[1516.16 --> 1517.48]  The new meta
[1517.48 --> 1517.98]  Ha ha
[1517.98 --> 1518.50]  Ha ha
[1518.50 --> 1519.40]  Very good
[1519.40 --> 1521.48]  I get it
[1521.48 --> 1522.26]  I get it now
[1522.26 --> 1522.74]  And it's like
[1522.74 --> 1523.58]  Kind of genius
[1523.58 --> 1526.28]  I'm surprised
[1526.28 --> 1527.08]  It worked this well
[1527.08 --> 1527.92]  It's a lot of
[1527.92 --> 1528.62]  Self-awareness
[1528.62 --> 1529.86]  Yeah
[1529.86 --> 1530.58]  It's um
[1530.58 --> 1532.16]  I think
[1532.16 --> 1532.68]  When I
[1532.68 --> 1533.60]  I jumped on it
[1533.60 --> 1534.34]  Because why not
[1534.34 --> 1534.98]  I was interested
[1534.98 --> 1535.84]  I wanted to mostly
[1535.84 --> 1536.98]  Just reserve my username
[1536.98 --> 1538.60]  I haven't
[1538.60 --> 1539.90]  Threaded
[1539.90 --> 1540.52]  Anything
[1540.52 --> 1542.90]  I hate it already
[1542.90 --> 1543.50]  Yeah
[1543.50 --> 1544.34]  That's terrible
[1544.34 --> 1545.12]  I've never actually
[1545.12 --> 1545.96]  Said that out loud before
[1545.96 --> 1546.44]  That sounds
[1546.44 --> 1547.44]  Horrible
[1547.44 --> 1548.10]  Sounds like
[1548.10 --> 1548.72]  Hair removal
[1548.72 --> 1549.24]  Yeah
[1549.24 --> 1550.70]  I haven't threaded
[1550.70 --> 1551.46]  Anything yet
[1551.46 --> 1552.78]  But the
[1552.78 --> 1553.74]  Follow everyone
[1553.74 --> 1554.28]  You follow on
[1554.28 --> 1554.98]  Instagram thing
[1554.98 --> 1556.64]  Was smart
[1556.64 --> 1557.80]  Because it
[1557.80 --> 1558.98]  Immediately makes
[1558.98 --> 1560.50]  Your threads
[1560.50 --> 1561.26]  Experience
[1561.26 --> 1562.62]  Feel vibrant
[1562.62 --> 1563.48]  Because a bunch
[1563.48 --> 1564.12]  Of these people
[1564.12 --> 1564.62]  That you probably
[1564.62 --> 1565.28]  Follow on Instagram
[1565.28 --> 1566.38]  Are already on there
[1566.38 --> 1567.42]  So instead of like
[1567.42 --> 1567.96]  Oh I'm going to
[1567.96 --> 1568.70]  Follow the like
[1568.70 --> 1569.58]  Few people that
[1569.58 --> 1570.26]  I don't care about
[1570.26 --> 1570.82]  That Twitter makes
[1570.82 --> 1571.52]  Me follow when I
[1571.52 --> 1572.00]  Sign up
[1572.00 --> 1573.34]  It's like
[1573.34 --> 1573.88]  Oh these are
[1573.88 --> 1574.42]  People that I
[1574.42 --> 1575.02]  Already know
[1575.02 --> 1576.82]  And hey look
[1576.82 --> 1577.44]  They're already on
[1577.44 --> 1577.82]  Threads
[1577.82 --> 1578.58]  There's actually
[1578.58 --> 1579.58]  Stuff happening here
[1579.58 --> 1580.36]  One of the big
[1580.36 --> 1580.96]  Problems that I
[1580.96 --> 1581.48]  Think a lot of
[1581.48 --> 1583.34]  The other like
[1583.34 --> 1584.20]  Twitter clones
[1584.20 --> 1585.16]  That have popped up
[1585.16 --> 1585.56]  Have
[1585.56 --> 1586.64]  Is that it just
[1586.64 --> 1587.62]  Feels dead when
[1587.62 --> 1588.24]  You show up
[1588.24 --> 1589.60]  I also noticed
[1589.60 --> 1590.32]  At least when I
[1590.32 --> 1590.98]  Started using it
[1590.98 --> 1591.44]  I don't know if
[1591.44 --> 1592.04]  This has changed
[1592.04 --> 1592.72]  Or not yet
[1592.72 --> 1593.30]  Because it sounds
[1593.30 --> 1594.10]  Like a decent
[1594.10 --> 1594.72]  Amount has already
[1594.72 --> 1595.42]  Literally changed
[1595.42 --> 1596.44]  But they were
[1596.44 --> 1598.08]  Hiding certain
[1598.08 --> 1599.70]  Metrics
[1599.70 --> 1601.82]  Which probably
[1601.82 --> 1602.82]  Made sense in the
[1602.82 --> 1603.72]  First like
[1603.72 --> 1604.64]  Few hours
[1604.64 --> 1605.08]  Now that they
[1605.08 --> 1605.74]  Have 70 million
[1605.74 --> 1606.54]  Users maybe they
[1606.54 --> 1607.62]  Need to start
[1607.62 --> 1608.18]  Making that stuff
[1608.18 --> 1609.12]  More public
[1609.12 --> 1609.94]  But you couldn't
[1609.94 --> 1610.46]  See like how
[1610.46 --> 1611.10]  Many people liked
[1611.10 --> 1611.50]  Something
[1611.50 --> 1614.00]  But you could see
[1614.00 --> 1615.24]  The people responding
[1615.24 --> 1616.02]  To it and stuff
[1616.02 --> 1617.26]  Which if people
[1617.26 --> 1617.98]  Are responding to
[1617.98 --> 1618.16]  Things
[1618.16 --> 1618.50]  Which they're
[1618.50 --> 1619.06]  Likely to do
[1619.06 --> 1619.42]  On a new
[1619.42 --> 1619.82]  Platform
[1619.82 --> 1620.30]  Because they're
[1620.30 --> 1621.14]  Actively trying
[1621.14 --> 1621.72]  To use the
[1621.72 --> 1622.30]  New platform
[1622.30 --> 1623.20]  It's going to
[1623.20 --> 1623.76]  Make it feel
[1623.76 --> 1624.22]  A little bit
[1624.22 --> 1624.70]  More active
[1624.70 --> 1625.12]  Than it might
[1625.12 --> 1625.68]  Actually be
[1625.68 --> 1627.00]  And I think
[1627.00 --> 1627.52]  That was a
[1627.52 --> 1628.22]  Good way to
[1628.22 --> 1628.64]  Get people
[1628.64 --> 1629.14]  Into like
[1629.14 --> 1629.52]  Yeah no
[1629.52 --> 1630.00]  This is real
[1630.00 --> 1630.40]  This is real
[1630.40 --> 1630.70]  Things are
[1630.70 --> 1630.98]  Happening
[1630.98 --> 1631.40]  This is okay
[1631.40 --> 1631.88]  This is good
[1631.88 --> 1632.92]  Yeah
[1632.92 --> 1633.88]  Apparently Mr. Beast
[1633.88 --> 1634.54]  Has more followers
[1634.54 --> 1635.16]  On there than
[1635.16 --> 1635.92]  Zuckerberg
[1635.92 --> 1637.18]  That doesn't
[1637.18 --> 1637.80]  Surprise me
[1637.80 --> 1638.18]  Does that
[1638.18 --> 1638.88]  Surprise you
[1638.88 --> 1639.52]  No but
[1639.52 --> 1639.78]  It's just
[1639.78 --> 1640.30]  I mean
[1640.30 --> 1641.58]  The Zuck
[1641.58 --> 1642.32]  Is just sort
[1642.32 --> 1642.90]  Of like
[1642.90 --> 1645.72]  Oh man
[1645.72 --> 1647.68]  You're kind of
[1647.68 --> 1648.28]  Reluctantly
[1648.28 --> 1648.86]  Like you have
[1648.86 --> 1649.44]  To pay attention
[1649.44 --> 1649.82]  To them
[1649.82 --> 1650.64]  I mean it
[1650.64 --> 1650.90]  Really
[1650.90 --> 1651.68]  Realistically
[1651.68 --> 1652.18]  I mean it's
[1652.18 --> 1652.64]  No different
[1652.64 --> 1653.20]  Than Musk
[1653.20 --> 1653.90]  It's no different
[1653.90 --> 1654.60]  Than Bezos
[1654.60 --> 1655.26]  Like it's not
[1655.26 --> 1655.60]  Like
[1655.60 --> 1657.14]  Musk is just
[1657.14 --> 1658.10]  Like more public
[1658.10 --> 1658.80]  Than all the rest
[1658.80 --> 1659.60]  No offense
[1659.60 --> 1660.68]  To any of them
[1660.68 --> 1661.68]  I actually
[1661.68 --> 1662.78]  I don't
[1662.78 --> 1663.48]  I don't
[1663.48 --> 1663.88]  Need to have
[1663.88 --> 1664.52]  Dinner with them
[1664.52 --> 1665.38]  Like I just
[1665.38 --> 1668.38]  Yeah
[1668.38 --> 1670.14]  You know
[1670.14 --> 1671.06]  But I do
[1671.06 --> 1672.06]  I work in the
[1672.06 --> 1672.66]  Tech industry
[1672.66 --> 1673.26]  I do have to
[1673.26 --> 1674.02]  Kind of pay attention
[1674.02 --> 1674.82]  To what the
[1674.82 --> 1675.36]  Crap it is
[1675.36 --> 1675.74]  They're doing
[1675.74 --> 1676.64]  This time
[1676.64 --> 1677.00]  Yeah
[1677.00 --> 1678.30]  Um
[1678.30 --> 1679.48]  Mr. Beast
[1679.48 --> 1680.00]  Is doing a
[1680.00 --> 1680.68]  Tesla giveaway
[1680.68 --> 1681.28]  On threads
[1681.28 --> 1682.14]  Are you sure
[1682.14 --> 1682.90]  That's not a bot
[1682.90 --> 1683.54]  Yeah I know
[1683.54 --> 1683.94]  He is
[1683.94 --> 1684.54]  Oh wow
[1684.54 --> 1685.66]  Because he's
[1685.66 --> 1686.30]  Like whatever
[1686.30 --> 1686.94]  It's Jimmy right
[1686.94 --> 1687.34]  Like he does
[1687.34 --> 1688.56]  Yeah he just does
[1688.56 --> 1688.76]  Things
[1688.76 --> 1689.72]  Apparently we have
[1689.72 --> 1690.74]  A thread something
[1690.74 --> 1691.48]  I wanted to
[1691.48 --> 1692.12]  Yeah but it's not
[1692.12 --> 1692.60]  Official
[1692.60 --> 1693.66]  Yeah it is
[1693.66 --> 1694.30]  It is now
[1694.30 --> 1695.32]  I don't know
[1695.32 --> 1696.24]  What does official mean
[1696.24 --> 1697.32]  Apparently we didn't
[1697.32 --> 1698.02]  Have an official
[1698.02 --> 1699.48]  Account on Instagram
[1699.48 --> 1701.06]  Oh you mean like
[1701.06 --> 1701.92]  A verified account
[1701.92 --> 1702.52]  Yeah yeah yeah
[1702.52 --> 1702.86]  Sorry
[1702.86 --> 1703.94]  Oh okay
[1703.94 --> 1704.40]  So I
[1704.40 --> 1705.52]  They're working on it
[1705.52 --> 1705.90]  I guess
[1705.90 --> 1706.74]  Okay
[1706.74 --> 1707.42]  We should have
[1707.42 --> 1708.16]  Official accounts
[1708.16 --> 1709.14]  Except for when
[1709.14 --> 1709.88]  You have to pay for them
[1709.88 --> 1710.52]  And then we shouldn't
[1710.52 --> 1711.00]  Have official accounts
[1711.00 --> 1711.30]  Do I even
[1711.30 --> 1712.24]  Okay I do have
[1712.24 --> 1713.42]  Instagram on my phone
[1713.42 --> 1715.02]  Uh
[1715.02 --> 1716.28]  Okay I can log in
[1716.28 --> 1716.88]  Another account
[1716.88 --> 1717.10]  Oh
[1717.10 --> 1717.70]  God
[1717.70 --> 1718.32]  I don't even
[1718.32 --> 1718.82]  I don't even know
[1718.82 --> 1719.18]  The password
[1719.18 --> 1719.60]  What are you even
[1719.60 --> 1720.06]  Trying to do
[1720.06 --> 1720.72]  I want
[1720.72 --> 1721.54]  I want to see our
[1721.54 --> 1722.10]  Threads
[1722.10 --> 1722.86]  I haven't even
[1722.86 --> 1723.54]  Seen it yet
[1723.54 --> 1723.92]  Hold on
[1723.92 --> 1724.44]  Oh you have
[1724.44 --> 1725.08]  Oh right right right
[1725.08 --> 1725.80]  Yeah you have it
[1725.80 --> 1726.34]  Okay cool
[1726.34 --> 1727.74]  I get to see
[1727.74 --> 1728.34]  I get to see
[1728.34 --> 1729.14]  Our threads presence
[1729.14 --> 1730.02]  The social team
[1730.02 --> 1730.54]  Was telling me
[1730.54 --> 1731.06]  That apparently
[1731.06 --> 1731.96]  Interaction is
[1731.96 --> 1733.12]  Pretty similar
[1733.12 --> 1733.90]  On threads
[1733.90 --> 1735.04]  To the other
[1735.04 --> 1736.10]  Major platforms
[1736.10 --> 1736.56]  Right now
[1736.56 --> 1736.80]  Yeah
[1736.80 --> 1738.12]  Just because everyone
[1738.12 --> 1738.80]  It's the new
[1738.80 --> 1739.32]  Hotness right
[1739.32 --> 1739.84]  So people are
[1739.84 --> 1740.66]  Just checking it out
[1740.66 --> 1741.24]  Oh hey
[1741.24 --> 1741.80]  They have one of
[1741.80 --> 1742.32]  The tweet size
[1742.32 --> 1744.54]  Threads
[1744.54 --> 1745.74]  That I suggested
[1745.74 --> 1746.20]  Today
[1746.20 --> 1748.98]  Someone pointed out
[1748.98 --> 1750.00]  I've barely used
[1750.00 --> 1750.30]  The app
[1750.30 --> 1751.08]  But someone pointed out
[1751.08 --> 1751.70]  That when you go to
[1751.70 --> 1752.06]  Sharing
[1752.06 --> 1753.16]  You can tweet
[1753.16 --> 1754.06]  Threads
[1754.06 --> 1755.74]  Oh really
[1755.74 --> 1757.24]  Which looks really weird
[1757.24 --> 1757.96]  Because now there's like
[1757.96 --> 1758.70]  A tweet button
[1758.70 --> 1759.42]  In threads
[1759.42 --> 1760.14]  Which is like
[1760.14 --> 1762.28]  That blows my mind
[1762.28 --> 1763.38]  What's happening right now
[1763.38 --> 1763.94]  Okay
[1763.94 --> 1764.56]  People are asking
[1764.56 --> 1765.44]  What is threads
[1765.44 --> 1766.58]  Threads is
[1766.58 --> 1768.40]  Instagram or metas
[1768.40 --> 1769.10]  Or Facebook's
[1769.10 --> 1769.44]  Whatever
[1769.44 --> 1770.74]  Response to
[1770.74 --> 1771.42]  Twitter
[1771.42 --> 1772.20]  Effectively
[1772.20 --> 1773.20]  It is their version
[1773.20 --> 1773.70]  Of Twitter
[1773.70 --> 1775.48]  Yeah
[1775.48 --> 1776.16]  They've been working
[1776.16 --> 1776.68]  On it since
[1776.68 --> 1777.54]  January
[1777.54 --> 1778.84]  And now it's released
[1778.84 --> 1779.66]  That's how you know
[1779.66 --> 1780.54]  Something was really
[1780.54 --> 1781.16]  Really hard
[1781.16 --> 1782.02]  Well apparently
[1782.02 --> 1783.74]  My idea did not
[1783.74 --> 1784.88]  Perform very well
[1784.88 --> 1785.44]  Get on
[1785.44 --> 1787.10]  Liked by
[1787.10 --> 1788.14]  The Brad
[1788.14 --> 1788.60]  Fad
[1788.60 --> 1789.06]  And
[1789.06 --> 1790.00]  Others
[1790.00 --> 1791.44]  And then the one
[1791.44 --> 1792.00]  Under it
[1792.00 --> 1792.56]  Is
[1792.56 --> 1793.16]  Oh no
[1793.16 --> 1793.46]  Okay
[1793.46 --> 1793.78]  Apparently
[1793.78 --> 1794.50]  Some of them
[1794.50 --> 1794.72]  Just
[1794.72 --> 1795.42]  See some of the
[1795.42 --> 1796.10]  Metrics are like
[1796.10 --> 1796.40]  Not
[1796.40 --> 1796.92]  Weird
[1796.92 --> 1797.44]  Yeah
[1797.44 --> 1798.62]  View likes
[1798.62 --> 1799.44]  Something
[1799.44 --> 1799.86]  Something
[1799.86 --> 1800.38]  But then you have to
[1800.38 --> 1801.08]  Like scroll through
[1801.08 --> 1801.50]  All of it
[1801.50 --> 1801.90]  It doesn't
[1801.90 --> 1802.62]  It doesn't show you
[1802.62 --> 1803.08]  The number
[1803.08 --> 1803.56]  Thing
[1803.56 --> 1804.00]  Yeah
[1804.00 --> 1804.66]  Like it's
[1804.66 --> 1805.82]  It's oddly obscured
[1805.82 --> 1807.34]  Which I
[1807.34 --> 1808.36]  Feel like
[1808.36 --> 1809.42]  My gut is telling me
[1809.42 --> 1809.76]  Was it
[1809.76 --> 1810.72]  Was a choice
[1810.72 --> 1812.36]  For the initial launch
[1812.36 --> 1813.82]  So that
[1813.82 --> 1815.38]  It wasn't
[1815.38 --> 1816.10]  The focus
[1816.10 --> 1817.00]  Right
[1817.00 --> 1817.62]  Okay
[1817.62 --> 1818.74]  Yep
[1818.74 --> 1819.18]  I
[1819.18 --> 1820.70]  I have no idea
[1820.70 --> 1821.52]  And anything I can
[1821.52 --> 1822.74]  Only access on my phone
[1822.74 --> 1823.66]  Just doesn't exist
[1823.66 --> 1824.04]  To me
[1824.04 --> 1824.70]  Yeah there's no
[1824.70 --> 1825.78]  Website
[1825.78 --> 1827.70]  What the heck
[1827.70 --> 1831.60]  I remember people
[1831.60 --> 1832.18]  Telling me
[1832.18 --> 1833.12]  When TikTok
[1833.12 --> 1834.06]  Was popping off
[1834.06 --> 1834.70]  I remember people
[1834.70 --> 1835.14]  Telling me
[1835.14 --> 1835.28]  How
[1835.28 --> 1835.66]  Actually
[1835.66 --> 1836.66]  For that matter
[1836.66 --> 1837.24]  When Instagram
[1837.24 --> 1838.14]  Was popping off
[1838.14 --> 1838.82]  I remember people
[1838.82 --> 1839.36]  Telling me how
[1839.36 --> 1840.14]  Amazing it was
[1840.14 --> 1840.88]  And I would go
[1840.88 --> 1841.92]  To Instagram.com
[1841.92 --> 1842.90]  The desktop experience
[1842.90 --> 1843.50]  Is terrible
[1843.50 --> 1844.28]  No I'm talking
[1844.28 --> 1845.04]  Before that
[1845.04 --> 1846.40]  When it was
[1846.40 --> 1847.04]  Just a link
[1847.04 --> 1847.94]  To the app store
[1847.94 --> 1848.76]  And I was like
[1848.76 --> 1850.62]  I'm not gonna do that
[1850.62 --> 1851.70]  I'm
[1851.70 --> 1852.40]  Just
[1852.40 --> 1854.64]  Realistically
[1854.64 --> 1855.50]  Like most of
[1855.50 --> 1856.14]  What you're doing
[1856.14 --> 1856.86]  Is probably
[1856.86 --> 1857.92]  Like web based
[1857.92 --> 1858.32]  Anyway
[1858.32 --> 1859.12]  Just put it on
[1859.12 --> 1859.26]  The
[1859.26 --> 1860.32]  Just put it
[1860.32 --> 1860.84]  In a stupid
[1860.84 --> 1861.48]  Vertical
[1861.48 --> 1862.62]  Window
[1862.62 --> 1863.22]  I don't care
[1863.22 --> 1863.64]  I feel like
[1863.64 --> 1864.24]  How much web
[1864.24 --> 1865.00]  Browsing I do
[1865.00 --> 1865.60]  In a browser
[1865.60 --> 1866.30]  On a desktop
[1866.30 --> 1866.94]  Is probably
[1866.94 --> 1867.36]  The like
[1867.36 --> 1867.90]  Boomerest
[1867.90 --> 1868.66]  Thing about me
[1868.66 --> 1870.74]  Yeah
[1870.74 --> 1871.82]  I just
[1871.82 --> 1872.40]  I just
[1872.40 --> 1873.04]  I want the
[1873.04 --> 1873.54]  Website to be
[1873.54 --> 1874.20]  The best version
[1874.20 --> 1874.90]  But
[1874.90 --> 1876.20]  For a lot of
[1876.20 --> 1876.64]  The like
[1876.64 --> 1877.38]  Hip young
[1877.38 --> 1878.30]  You know
[1878.30 --> 1879.02]  Apps and
[1879.02 --> 1879.70]  Experiences
[1879.70 --> 1880.28]  And products
[1880.28 --> 1880.66]  And whatever
[1880.66 --> 1881.38]  There like
[1881.38 --> 1882.50]  Isn't even a
[1882.50 --> 1883.06]  Website
[1883.06 --> 1883.68]  Or like
[1883.68 --> 1884.02]  You were just
[1884.02 --> 1884.32]  Talking about
[1884.32 --> 1884.78]  It's just a link
[1884.78 --> 1885.42]  To the app store
[1885.42 --> 1885.90]  Or it's an
[1885.90 --> 1886.60]  Afterthought
[1886.60 --> 1887.46]  Like Instagram's
[1887.46 --> 1888.04]  Currently is
[1888.04 --> 1888.62]  Or something like
[1888.62 --> 1888.82]  That
[1888.82 --> 1889.22]  It's just like
[1889.22 --> 1889.82]  Oh man
[1889.82 --> 1890.72]  Like
[1890.72 --> 1893.68]  Oh well
[1893.68 --> 1894.74]  Websites work
[1894.74 --> 1895.04]  Better
[1895.04 --> 1895.62]  I mean
[1895.62 --> 1897.28]  Sure
[1897.28 --> 1898.28]  When they do
[1898.28 --> 1899.04]  They don't
[1899.04 --> 1899.72]  For everyone
[1899.72 --> 1900.82]  Yep
[1900.82 --> 1901.70]  Yep
[1901.70 --> 1902.40]  That's fair
[1902.40 --> 1903.14]  Man
[1903.14 --> 1903.58]  I
[1903.58 --> 1904.18]  Okay
[1904.18 --> 1904.82]  Let's
[1904.82 --> 1905.46]  Let's
[1905.46 --> 1905.76]  Let's
[1905.76 --> 1906.42]  Let's take bets
[1906.42 --> 1906.66]  Here
[1906.66 --> 1908.58]  Who emerges
[1908.58 --> 1908.94]  Here
[1908.94 --> 1909.28]  Because
[1909.28 --> 1910.10]  Blue sky
[1910.10 --> 1910.64]  Hasn't gone
[1910.64 --> 1910.98]  Away
[1910.98 --> 1911.90]  Nope
[1911.90 --> 1912.46]  They're
[1912.46 --> 1912.84]  They just
[1912.84 --> 1913.28]  Seem to be
[1913.28 --> 1913.86]  Still wrapping
[1913.86 --> 1914.46]  Infrastructure
[1914.46 --> 1914.80]  I don't
[1914.80 --> 1915.16]  Think it's
[1915.16 --> 1915.46]  Going to be
[1915.46 --> 1915.88]  Blue sky
[1915.88 --> 1916.34]  Personally
[1916.34 --> 1917.14]  Yeah
[1917.14 --> 1917.50]  Okay
[1917.50 --> 1918.22]  That's
[1918.22 --> 1919.72]  Fair enough
[1919.72 --> 1920.06]  But
[1920.06 --> 1920.40]  I think
[1920.40 --> 1920.80]  Threads
[1920.80 --> 1921.20]  Will beat
[1921.20 --> 1921.76]  Blue sky
[1921.76 --> 1923.00]  I
[1923.00 --> 1924.42]  Feel like
[1924.42 --> 1925.02]  Right now
[1925.02 --> 1925.46]  I would be
[1925.46 --> 1926.26]  Making a complete
[1926.26 --> 1926.80]  Up in the air
[1926.80 --> 1927.50]  Guess based on
[1927.50 --> 1928.20]  Nothing to say
[1928.20 --> 1928.76]  Whether it would
[1928.76 --> 1929.18]  Be twitter
[1929.18 --> 1929.72]  Or threads
[1929.72 --> 1930.76]  Really
[1930.76 --> 1931.28]  Yeah
[1931.28 --> 1931.88]  You think
[1931.88 --> 1932.48]  Twitter has a
[1932.48 --> 1932.84]  Chance
[1932.84 --> 1933.82]  I do
[1933.82 --> 1935.52]  I do
[1935.52 --> 1936.62]  I would absolutely
[1936.62 --> 1937.28]  Not at all
[1937.28 --> 1938.00]  Be surprised
[1938.00 --> 1938.50]  If threads
[1938.50 --> 1939.26]  Just completely
[1939.26 --> 1939.94]  Took their lunch
[1939.94 --> 1940.20]  Either
[1940.20 --> 1940.96]  Like I'm not
[1940.96 --> 1941.36]  I'm not
[1941.36 --> 1941.96]  I'm not really
[1941.96 --> 1942.78]  In any camp
[1942.78 --> 1943.02]  Here
[1943.02 --> 1944.42]  I have experienced
[1944.42 --> 1945.86]  A significantly
[1945.86 --> 1947.38]  Degraded experience
[1947.38 --> 1948.14]  On twitter
[1948.14 --> 1949.10]  Over time
[1949.10 --> 1950.12]  Like over the last
[1950.12 --> 1950.44]  While
[1950.44 --> 1950.48]  Yeah but threads
[1950.48 --> 1950.98]  Is currently
[1950.98 --> 1952.94]  Like very lacking
[1952.94 --> 1953.50]  In features
[1953.50 --> 1954.26]  That's fair
[1954.26 --> 1955.10]  But look at
[1955.10 --> 1955.92]  What freaking
[1955.92 --> 1956.80]  Twitter was up to
[1956.80 --> 1957.24]  This week
[1957.24 --> 1958.06]  With rate limiting
[1958.06 --> 1959.34]  On scrolling posts
[1959.34 --> 1960.82]  Like that's
[1960.82 --> 1962.02]  That's embarrassing
[1962.02 --> 1962.58]  That's like
[1962.58 --> 1963.78]  Rolling blackouts
[1963.78 --> 1965.24]  Right
[1965.24 --> 1965.72]  I thought it was
[1965.72 --> 1966.28]  Hilarious
[1966.28 --> 1966.90]  This is like
[1966.90 --> 1967.84]  Obviously you think
[1967.84 --> 1968.54]  It's funny
[1968.54 --> 1969.70]  I think it's so funny
[1969.70 --> 1970.82]  I thought it was
[1970.82 --> 1971.44]  Good even
[1971.44 --> 1971.92]  Because like
[1971.92 --> 1972.16]  Whatever
[1972.16 --> 1972.74]  Get off this
[1972.74 --> 1973.44]  Garbage app
[1973.44 --> 1974.32]  It's great
[1974.32 --> 1975.36]  Right but we're
[1975.36 --> 1975.90]  Talking about
[1975.90 --> 1976.02]  It's not good
[1976.02 --> 1976.64]  For the app
[1976.64 --> 1977.40]  Yeah that's what
[1977.40 --> 1977.90]  I'm saying
[1977.90 --> 1978.50]  Screw them
[1978.50 --> 1979.32]  Like it was
[1979.32 --> 1981.42]  But okay
[1981.42 --> 1982.14]  There's a discussion
[1982.14 --> 1982.74]  Question here
[1982.74 --> 1982.94]  How do you choose
[1982.94 --> 1983.88]  Which dumpster fire
[1983.88 --> 1984.62]  To cheer for
[1984.62 --> 1985.28]  That's the problem
[1985.28 --> 1985.56]  Burn
[1985.56 --> 1985.98]  Burn
[1985.98 --> 1986.56]  Burn
[1986.56 --> 1986.92]  Burn
[1986.92 --> 1987.82]  More than the other guy
[1987.82 --> 1988.72]  I just want them
[1988.72 --> 1989.42]  Both to burn
[1989.42 --> 1990.56]  I want them to
[1990.56 --> 1991.62]  Competitively burn
[1991.62 --> 1992.58]  The discussion
[1992.58 --> 1993.44]  Question on this
[1993.44 --> 1993.98]  Topic is
[1993.98 --> 1996.34]  The world needs
[1996.34 --> 1996.88]  Another twitter
[1996.88 --> 1997.48]  But should we
[1997.48 --> 1998.32]  Really want another
[1998.32 --> 1999.22]  Meta run social
[1999.22 --> 1999.88]  Media platform
[1999.88 --> 2000.60]  And that's it
[2000.60 --> 2001.22]  It's like really
[2001.22 --> 2002.28]  This is the one
[2002.28 --> 2003.46]  That's gonna do it
[2003.46 --> 2004.58]  Man
[2004.58 --> 2005.30]  Like I
[2005.30 --> 2007.32]  Didn't really think
[2007.32 --> 2008.22]  Blue sky had much
[2008.22 --> 2008.76]  Of a chance
[2008.76 --> 2010.24]  But I thought
[2010.24 --> 2010.74]  Maybe
[2010.74 --> 2011.70]  Because there was
[2011.70 --> 2012.46]  Nothing else
[2012.46 --> 2013.86]  And then now
[2013.86 --> 2015.24]  There's something else
[2015.24 --> 2015.84]  And now I think
[2015.84 --> 2016.46]  They're screwed
[2016.46 --> 2018.32]  And for as much
[2018.32 --> 2018.70]  As like
[2018.70 --> 2019.24]  This is a lot
[2019.24 --> 2019.74]  Of momentum
[2019.74 --> 2020.52]  When blue sky
[2020.52 --> 2021.62]  Is still limiting
[2021.62 --> 2022.18]  Sign ups
[2022.18 --> 2022.78]  Because they
[2022.78 --> 2023.44]  Can't build
[2023.44 --> 2024.38]  Infrastructure fast
[2024.38 --> 2024.60]  Enough
[2024.60 --> 2025.16]  I assume
[2025.16 --> 2026.58]  That's my guess
[2026.58 --> 2027.76]  Otherwise
[2027.76 --> 2028.66]  Why would you
[2028.66 --> 2029.48]  Limit sign ups
[2029.48 --> 2030.32]  If you can just
[2030.32 --> 2031.40]  Have momentum
[2031.40 --> 2032.06]  On your side
[2032.06 --> 2033.74]  I am blown away
[2033.74 --> 2034.74]  That meta managed
[2034.74 --> 2035.50]  To pull this
[2035.50 --> 2036.28]  Out of
[2036.28 --> 2037.70]  Complete stealth
[2037.70 --> 2038.00]  Yeah
[2038.00 --> 2038.98]  I had
[2038.98 --> 2039.56]  I don't know a single
[2039.56 --> 2040.40]  Person that saw this coming
[2040.40 --> 2040.96]  No idea
[2040.96 --> 2041.34]  Nope
[2041.34 --> 2042.48]  Like okay
[2042.48 --> 2043.56]  They probably could have
[2043.56 --> 2044.22]  Seen it coming
[2044.22 --> 2045.36]  Yeah
[2045.36 --> 2046.26]  But I don't think
[2046.26 --> 2047.20]  Anyone knew
[2047.20 --> 2047.86]  It was coming
[2047.86 --> 2048.52]  Yeah
[2048.52 --> 2048.82]  Yes
[2048.82 --> 2049.08]  Yeah
[2049.08 --> 2049.54]  Yeah
[2049.54 --> 2053.74]  How is a company
[2053.74 --> 2054.54]  The size
[2054.54 --> 2055.78]  Of meta Facebook
[2055.78 --> 2057.44]  Working on a project
[2057.44 --> 2058.22]  Like this
[2058.22 --> 2058.78]  I wonder how big
[2058.78 --> 2059.42]  The team was
[2059.42 --> 2060.76]  Okay
[2060.76 --> 2061.80]  Well let's get to that
[2061.80 --> 2063.02]  One of the
[2063.02 --> 2064.48]  Major developments
[2064.48 --> 2065.30]  This week
[2065.30 --> 2066.58]  Is that Twitter
[2066.58 --> 2067.88]  Upon seeing
[2067.88 --> 2069.04]  The launch of threads
[2069.04 --> 2069.76]  Oh
[2069.76 --> 2071.06]  Threatened a lawsuit
[2071.06 --> 2071.92]  On the grounds
[2071.92 --> 2072.80]  That meta
[2072.80 --> 2073.56]  Allegedly
[2073.56 --> 2074.74]  Hired ex-Twitter
[2074.74 --> 2075.44]  Employees
[2075.44 --> 2077.12]  And misappropriated
[2077.12 --> 2077.60]  Twitter's
[2077.60 --> 2078.84]  Trade secrets
[2078.84 --> 2079.56]  And other
[2079.56 --> 2080.82]  Intellectual property
[2080.82 --> 2082.80]  A meta spokesperson
[2082.80 --> 2083.86]  Responded that
[2083.86 --> 2085.08]  No one on the
[2085.08 --> 2086.08]  Thread's engineering team
[2086.08 --> 2086.70]  Is a former
[2086.70 --> 2087.38]  Twitter employee
[2087.38 --> 2088.04]  Which I don't think
[2088.04 --> 2088.88]  Is a sicker burn
[2088.88 --> 2089.86]  On Elon Musk
[2089.86 --> 2090.94]  Or a sicker burn
[2090.94 --> 2092.38]  On the former
[2092.38 --> 2093.62]  Twitter employee base
[2093.62 --> 2095.46]  We actually
[2095.46 --> 2096.04]  Literally
[2096.04 --> 2096.98]  Didn't need
[2096.98 --> 2097.62]  Any of you
[2097.62 --> 2099.50]  To make this
[2099.50 --> 2100.04]  None of them
[2100.04 --> 2100.94]  Like kind of
[2100.94 --> 2102.00]  Less feature
[2102.00 --> 2102.76]  Rich Twitter
[2102.76 --> 2103.76]  They wouldn't have
[2103.76 --> 2104.84]  Again I'm going to say
[2104.84 --> 2105.68]  It's not
[2105.68 --> 2107.48]  It is not very complicated
[2107.48 --> 2112.28]  If they can build
[2112.28 --> 2112.72]  Instagram
[2112.72 --> 2114.68]  They can build threads
[2114.68 --> 2115.66]  Can I just say
[2115.66 --> 2116.28]  That it is
[2116.28 --> 2117.06]  Absolutely
[2117.06 --> 2118.32]  Hilarious
[2118.32 --> 2120.56]  That you would
[2120.56 --> 2121.22]  Go in
[2121.22 --> 2122.56]  Acquire a company
[2122.56 --> 2124.50]  Fire the majority
[2124.50 --> 2125.52]  Of the employees
[2125.52 --> 2126.00]  There
[2126.00 --> 2127.06]  And then be
[2127.06 --> 2128.02]  Surprised
[2128.02 --> 2129.30]  If there was
[2129.30 --> 2130.04]  Some kind of
[2130.04 --> 2130.44]  Like
[2130.44 --> 2132.14]  Knowledge
[2132.14 --> 2133.24]  Like brain drain
[2133.24 --> 2134.24]  That occurred
[2134.24 --> 2135.38]  That enabled
[2135.38 --> 2136.02]  A competitor
[2136.02 --> 2139.42]  Yeah
[2139.42 --> 2140.46]  It's not
[2140.46 --> 2141.20]  Not what happened
[2141.20 --> 2143.24]  So what if
[2143.24 --> 2143.86]  It had
[2143.86 --> 2145.34]  Like
[2145.34 --> 2146.36]  What do
[2146.36 --> 2147.04]  Employees
[2147.04 --> 2147.44]  Owe you
[2147.44 --> 2148.08]  Exactly
[2148.08 --> 2149.46]  If you
[2149.46 --> 2150.48]  Someone
[2150.48 --> 2151.28]  Like
[2151.28 --> 2152.14]  What
[2152.14 --> 2152.84]  They're going to
[2152.84 --> 2153.60]  Pretend they never
[2153.60 --> 2154.24]  Worked there
[2154.24 --> 2155.30]  This is part of
[2155.30 --> 2156.32]  Like non-competes
[2156.32 --> 2156.84]  And intellectual
[2156.84 --> 2157.48]  Property though
[2157.48 --> 2158.08]  So if they
[2158.08 --> 2158.92]  Did use
[2158.92 --> 2159.28]  Like
[2159.28 --> 2160.60]  Twitter proprietary
[2160.60 --> 2161.20]  Stuff
[2161.20 --> 2161.80]  Sure but
[2161.80 --> 2162.44]  Clearly
[2162.44 --> 2163.22]  Threads is not
[2163.22 --> 2163.76]  Running twitter
[2163.76 --> 2164.18]  Code
[2164.18 --> 2165.56]  And wouldn't
[2165.56 --> 2165.96]  Need to
[2165.96 --> 2167.56]  Yeah
[2167.56 --> 2168.14]  So like
[2168.14 --> 2168.78]  I don't know
[2168.78 --> 2169.60]  It's clearly
[2169.60 --> 2170.34]  A lash out
[2170.34 --> 2172.98]  Yeah
[2172.98 --> 2173.38]  Just
[2173.38 --> 2173.94]  It
[2173.94 --> 2175.46]  It comes across
[2175.46 --> 2176.52]  Pretty sour grapes
[2176.52 --> 2177.00]  And I just
[2177.00 --> 2177.72]  I
[2177.72 --> 2178.64]  I'm sorry
[2178.64 --> 2179.38]  But I can't
[2179.38 --> 2180.10]  Feel bad
[2180.10 --> 2180.98]  For someone
[2180.98 --> 2181.88]  Who goes in
[2181.88 --> 2182.70]  And
[2182.70 --> 2184.40]  Half arbitrarily
[2184.40 --> 2185.28]  Just like
[2185.28 --> 2187.02]  Destroys the
[2187.02 --> 2187.62]  Livelihoods
[2187.62 --> 2188.02]  Of thousands
[2188.02 --> 2188.50]  Of people
[2188.50 --> 2188.96]  Oh yeah
[2188.96 --> 2190.26]  Was that ship
[2190.26 --> 2190.86]  Sustainable
[2190.86 --> 2191.64]  No
[2191.64 --> 2192.32]  No probably
[2192.32 --> 2192.92]  Not but
[2192.92 --> 2194.08]  Oh definitely
[2194.08 --> 2194.28]  Not
[2194.28 --> 2194.66]  They shouldn't
[2194.66 --> 2195.40]  Have bought it
[2195.40 --> 2195.84]  Yeah
[2195.84 --> 2196.32]  That
[2196.32 --> 2196.72]  The
[2196.72 --> 2197.80]  The time
[2197.80 --> 2198.38]  To
[2198.38 --> 2198.88]  The time
[2198.88 --> 2199.18]  To
[2199.18 --> 2199.94]  To do this
[2199.94 --> 2200.54]  Correctly
[2200.54 --> 2201.38]  Was before
[2201.38 --> 2201.96]  You actually
[2201.96 --> 2202.60]  Wrote the check
[2202.60 --> 2203.44]  Yeah I think
[2203.44 --> 2204.12]  The only thing
[2204.12 --> 2204.38]  That
[2204.38 --> 2206.04]  Doesn't bother me
[2206.04 --> 2206.90]  Quite as much
[2206.90 --> 2207.34]  About it
[2207.34 --> 2208.30]  Is that I am
[2208.30 --> 2208.96]  Rather
[2208.96 --> 2209.70]  Certain
[2209.70 --> 2210.56]  They were all
[2210.56 --> 2211.36]  Losing their jobs
[2211.36 --> 2211.84]  Anyways
[2211.84 --> 2212.68]  I mean
[2212.68 --> 2213.36]  That's fair enough
[2213.36 --> 2214.42]  We talked in the early days
[2214.42 --> 2216.52]  Before Elon bought twitter
[2216.52 --> 2218.06]  About how insane twitter
[2218.06 --> 2218.90]  Was as a business
[2218.90 --> 2220.16]  Just burning literally
[2220.16 --> 2221.12]  Billions of dollars
[2221.12 --> 2221.38]  A year
[2221.38 --> 2221.78]  Forever
[2221.78 --> 2223.92]  With no plan
[2223.92 --> 2224.38]  To profitability
[2224.38 --> 2224.96]  In perpetuity
[2224.96 --> 2225.84]  With no
[2225.84 --> 2226.68]  Like it was actually
[2226.68 --> 2227.34]  One of the like
[2227.34 --> 2229.72]  One of the most
[2229.72 --> 2230.80]  Dumpster fire businesses
[2230.80 --> 2231.80]  I've ever seen
[2231.80 --> 2232.86]  Like it made
[2232.86 --> 2234.26]  No sense at all
[2234.26 --> 2234.82]  So like
[2234.82 --> 2235.46]  It was not
[2235.46 --> 2236.16]  Going to be sustainable
[2236.16 --> 2237.34]  And the
[2237.34 --> 2238.06]  The
[2238.06 --> 2238.50]  The
[2238.50 --> 2239.54]  The reapers coming
[2239.54 --> 2240.32]  For a lot of
[2240.32 --> 2241.26]  These types of companies
[2241.26 --> 2242.52]  That just make no money
[2242.52 --> 2243.26]  And have no plan
[2243.26 --> 2244.22]  To ever make any money
[2244.22 --> 2245.48]  And just lose tons of money
[2245.48 --> 2246.60]  That was a thing
[2246.60 --> 2247.80]  For a really long time
[2247.80 --> 2248.86]  But you're seeing
[2248.86 --> 2249.86]  You're seeing that
[2249.86 --> 2250.56]  Kind of end
[2250.56 --> 2251.54]  So yeah
[2251.54 --> 2252.20]  I don't know
[2252.20 --> 2254.02]  Makes me feel less bad
[2254.02 --> 2255.60]  It still sucks
[2255.60 --> 2256.80]  That they're out of work
[2256.80 --> 2257.66]  But I just
[2257.66 --> 2258.56]  I don't think it's actually
[2258.56 --> 2259.72]  Really that much different
[2259.72 --> 2261.64]  Helix919 in twitch chat
[2261.64 --> 2261.88]  Says
[2261.88 --> 2263.62]  Non-competes are hard to enforce
[2263.62 --> 2264.82]  When you broke contracts
[2264.82 --> 2266.12]  And didn't pay the severance
[2266.12 --> 2267.62]  To the employees you fired
[2267.62 --> 2269.52]  Yikes
[2269.52 --> 2270.00]  That's a
[2270.00 --> 2271.90]  That's a pretty good point
[2271.90 --> 2272.76]  Yeah
[2272.76 --> 2276.58]  Oh that's epic
[2276.58 --> 2278.74]  Someone in chat said
[2278.74 --> 2279.72]  How would you design
[2279.72 --> 2280.46]  A twitter clone
[2280.46 --> 2281.54]  Is an extremely common
[2281.54 --> 2282.36]  Tech interview question
[2282.36 --> 2283.06]  Yeah it is
[2283.06 --> 2285.38]  I actually didn't know that
[2285.38 --> 2285.68]  Yeah
[2285.68 --> 2286.82]  Just why
[2286.82 --> 2287.80]  Because it's like
[2287.80 --> 2288.18]  Because it's like
[2288.18 --> 2290.28]  Like early university
[2290.28 --> 2291.30]  Level project
[2291.30 --> 2292.80]  Like
[2292.80 --> 2295.12]  The difficulty
[2295.12 --> 2296.08]  Is the scaling
[2296.08 --> 2296.40]  Right
[2296.40 --> 2296.78]  Okay
[2296.78 --> 2297.70]  I was gonna say
[2297.70 --> 2298.78]  I feel like
[2298.78 --> 2299.62]  Every time we have
[2299.62 --> 2300.32]  This conversation
[2300.32 --> 2301.40]  I have to point out
[2301.40 --> 2302.62]  That serving
[2302.62 --> 2303.80]  A text post
[2303.80 --> 2305.08]  To one person
[2305.08 --> 2305.82]  Is easy
[2305.82 --> 2307.26]  Serving a text post
[2307.26 --> 2308.74]  To a hundred million people
[2308.74 --> 2309.86]  Is actually
[2309.86 --> 2311.42]  Not that easy
[2311.42 --> 2311.74]  Yeah
[2311.74 --> 2312.52]  Okay
[2312.52 --> 2312.96]  Alright
[2312.96 --> 2313.54]  Then we're on the same page
[2313.54 --> 2314.40]  But we've had
[2314.40 --> 2316.30]  Dig and Reddit forever
[2316.30 --> 2317.60]  We've had Twitter forever
[2317.60 --> 2318.10]  Like this
[2318.10 --> 2319.68]  The knowledge around
[2319.68 --> 2320.84]  That type of tech
[2320.84 --> 2322.52]  Has been around
[2322.52 --> 2324.50]  For a very long time
[2324.50 --> 2325.36]  And the amount
[2325.36 --> 2326.50]  That something gets easy
[2326.50 --> 2327.14]  Over time
[2327.14 --> 2328.54]  In the development space
[2328.54 --> 2329.28]  Is like
[2329.28 --> 2330.30]  Quite rapid
[2330.30 --> 2331.96]  When something is first created
[2331.96 --> 2332.56]  It might have been
[2332.56 --> 2333.68]  Extremely hard to create
[2333.68 --> 2334.10]  That thing
[2334.10 --> 2335.46]  But three years later
[2335.46 --> 2336.26]  Six years later
[2336.26 --> 2337.14]  Nine years later
[2337.14 --> 2338.12]  More and more on
[2338.12 --> 2339.00]  It gets
[2339.00 --> 2340.28]  Significantly easier
[2340.28 --> 2341.38]  Imperator in floatplane chat
[2341.38 --> 2341.74]  Says
[2341.74 --> 2342.96]  Threads probably started
[2342.96 --> 2343.98]  As a hobby project
[2343.98 --> 2344.78]  By some of the
[2344.78 --> 2345.82]  Facebook engineers
[2345.82 --> 2347.00]  Well I think
[2347.00 --> 2347.96]  Is it in here
[2347.96 --> 2348.74]  I think it was
[2348.74 --> 2350.28]  Genuinely January
[2350.28 --> 2350.64]  Right
[2350.64 --> 2352.70]  It's not in our notes
[2352.70 --> 2353.16]  I'm not sure
[2353.16 --> 2353.48]  Meta
[2353.48 --> 2354.64]  No
[2354.64 --> 2355.18]  It's
[2355.18 --> 2355.96]  Insta
[2355.96 --> 2357.38]  Yeah
[2357.38 --> 2358.34]  Coder goth says
[2358.34 --> 2359.10]  The hard part of Twitter
[2359.10 --> 2359.94]  Isn't the UI
[2359.94 --> 2360.54]  It's the scale
[2360.54 --> 2361.48]  And the content moderation
[2361.48 --> 2362.40]  That's another big one
[2362.40 --> 2362.44]  Yeah
[2362.44 --> 2363.44]  But with that
[2363.44 --> 2364.36]  With that said
[2364.36 --> 2364.78]  I mean
[2364.78 --> 2365.74]  Twitter has
[2365.74 --> 2366.94]  Basically abandoned
[2366.94 --> 2367.80]  All pretense
[2367.80 --> 2369.06]  Of content moderation
[2369.06 --> 2369.66]  At this point
[2369.66 --> 2370.76]  As far as I can tell
[2370.76 --> 2372.24]  Meanwhile
[2372.24 --> 2373.76]  Meta is saying
[2373.76 --> 2374.54]  That they are going
[2374.54 --> 2375.14]  To take
[2375.14 --> 2376.34]  Yeah they want it
[2376.34 --> 2376.96]  To be the friendly platform
[2376.96 --> 2377.40]  They want it to be
[2377.40 --> 2378.88]  Which is actually
[2378.88 --> 2379.54]  Very attractive
[2379.54 --> 2380.88]  To a lot of brands
[2380.88 --> 2381.96]  For advertisements
[2381.96 --> 2383.26]  Which sustain a platform
[2383.26 --> 2384.42]  I wish them
[2384.42 --> 2386.34]  The best of luck
[2386.34 --> 2386.70]  Oh yeah
[2386.70 --> 2387.56]  That'll be tough
[2387.56 --> 2389.00]  Because the problem
[2389.00 --> 2390.80]  With having a friendly platform
[2390.80 --> 2392.18]  With a lot of users
[2392.18 --> 2393.60]  Is that users
[2393.60 --> 2394.64]  Is just another word
[2394.64 --> 2395.28]  For people
[2395.28 --> 2396.36]  And people are
[2396.36 --> 2396.92]  F***ing
[2396.92 --> 2397.68]  A**holes
[2397.68 --> 2398.20]  Yeah
[2398.20 --> 2400.88]  Especially when they
[2400.88 --> 2401.68]  Have anonymity
[2401.68 --> 2402.72]  And so
[2402.72 --> 2404.92]  Imagining
[2404.92 --> 2405.72]  That you're going
[2405.72 --> 2406.64]  To somehow have
[2406.64 --> 2408.10]  It's like saying
[2408.10 --> 2409.14]  I'm going to
[2409.14 --> 2409.62]  I'm going to
[2409.62 --> 2410.90]  Make a multiplayer game
[2410.90 --> 2411.82]  One with a
[2411.82 --> 2413.28]  Non-toxic user base
[2413.28 --> 2415.52]  It's like
[2415.52 --> 2416.88]  Well I was with you
[2416.88 --> 2417.62]  Up until you're going
[2417.62 --> 2418.80]  To make a multiplayer game
[2418.80 --> 2419.58]  That sounds good
[2419.58 --> 2422.06]  That second part though
[2422.06 --> 2423.60]  That's why
[2423.60 --> 2424.74]  Online play
[2424.74 --> 2426.10]  Is never rated
[2426.10 --> 2426.42]  Right
[2426.42 --> 2428.00]  Yeah
[2428.00 --> 2428.64]  Yeah okay
[2428.64 --> 2429.10]  Yeah I guess
[2429.10 --> 2429.78]  That's fair enough
[2429.78 --> 2430.90]  So
[2430.90 --> 2432.24]  Couple things here
[2432.24 --> 2432.68]  Yes
[2432.68 --> 2433.54]  Development did start
[2433.54 --> 2434.14]  In January
[2434.14 --> 2434.80]  Two
[2434.80 --> 2435.62]  It was called
[2435.62 --> 2436.88]  Project 92
[2436.88 --> 2437.82]  Internally
[2437.82 --> 2439.52]  And I just googled
[2439.52 --> 2441.06]  Project 92
[2441.06 --> 2441.90]  Rumors
[2441.90 --> 2443.38]  And there's stuff
[2443.38 --> 2444.00]  From like
[2444.00 --> 2445.26]  June
[2445.26 --> 2446.26]  Rumor has it
[2446.26 --> 2447.44]  Meta is making
[2447.44 --> 2448.10]  A comeback
[2448.10 --> 2448.82]  Writing a virtual
[2448.82 --> 2449.80]  Wave of
[2449.80 --> 2450.40]  Blah blah blah
[2450.40 --> 2451.10]  Something
[2451.10 --> 2451.82]  Project 92
[2451.82 --> 2452.70]  Meta versus Twitter
[2452.70 --> 2453.46]  Posted in June
[2453.46 --> 2455.44]  So there's like
[2455.44 --> 2456.38]  There was some people
[2456.38 --> 2456.92]  That were like
[2456.92 --> 2458.28]  Something's happening
[2458.28 --> 2460.20]  But uh
[2460.20 --> 2461.10]  Yeah
[2461.10 --> 2462.36]  Interesting
[2462.36 --> 2464.36]  Topgear1224
[2464.36 --> 2465.40]  In floatplane chat
[2465.40 --> 2466.16]  Asks us
[2466.16 --> 2467.62]  Where's the line
[2467.62 --> 2469.22]  Between advertiser
[2469.22 --> 2469.84]  Friendly
[2469.84 --> 2470.90]  And censorship
[2470.90 --> 2474.10]  Yeah I don't know
[2474.10 --> 2474.66]  That's why I don't
[2474.66 --> 2475.00]  Work in
[2475.00 --> 2477.44]  I hate that stuff
[2477.44 --> 2477.84]  Our
[2477.84 --> 2479.06]  Our thing on the
[2479.06 --> 2479.82]  Forum was always
[2479.82 --> 2480.48]  Like this is a
[2480.48 --> 2480.96]  Tech site
[2480.96 --> 2481.86]  Just stop
[2481.86 --> 2483.40]  Yeah the line
[2483.40 --> 2484.46]  Is that it's
[2484.46 --> 2485.38]  A completely
[2485.38 --> 2486.72]  Optional service
[2486.72 --> 2487.38]  That you don't
[2487.38 --> 2488.10]  Need that is run
[2488.10 --> 2489.16]  By a private
[2489.16 --> 2489.70]  Company
[2489.70 --> 2490.54]  Yeah like and
[2490.54 --> 2490.92]  And that's
[2490.92 --> 2491.54]  That's honestly
[2491.54 --> 2492.16]  It too like
[2492.16 --> 2492.72]  With threads
[2492.72 --> 2493.22]  That's not
[2493.22 --> 2494.02]  Government censorship
[2494.02 --> 2494.70]  That's
[2494.70 --> 2495.42]  That's
[2495.42 --> 2497.18]  That's that
[2497.18 --> 2497.68]  Yeah
[2497.68 --> 2498.16]  Thing
[2498.16 --> 2498.76]  If threads
[2498.76 --> 2499.12]  Is like
[2499.12 --> 2499.98]  Don't use it
[2499.98 --> 2500.58]  You don't get to
[2500.58 --> 2501.52]  Talk about politics
[2501.52 --> 2501.88]  Ever
[2501.88 --> 2503.10]  Well that's
[2503.10 --> 2503.76]  That's their
[2503.76 --> 2504.56]  That actually
[2504.56 --> 2505.22]  Might be a good
[2505.22 --> 2505.46]  Thing
[2505.46 --> 2505.96]  It might be
[2505.96 --> 2506.46]  Are they saying
[2506.46 --> 2506.70]  That
[2506.70 --> 2507.00]  No
[2507.00 --> 2508.04]  I'm just saying
[2508.04 --> 2508.18]  Like
[2508.18 --> 2510.24]  Maybe I will
[2510.24 --> 2510.90]  Maybe I'll take
[2510.90 --> 2511.86]  Another crack at this
[2511.86 --> 2512.86]  I would legitimately
[2512.86 --> 2513.72]  Be more interested
[2513.72 --> 2514.86]  But yeah like if
[2514.86 --> 2515.86]  If they decide to
[2515.86 --> 2516.20]  Say that
[2516.20 --> 2517.20]  It's a private
[2517.20 --> 2517.58]  Platform
[2517.58 --> 2518.10]  This is not a
[2518.10 --> 2518.76]  Government funded
[2518.76 --> 2519.02]  Thing
[2519.02 --> 2519.46]  This is not
[2519.46 --> 2520.18]  Public property
[2520.18 --> 2521.14]  Like they could
[2521.14 --> 2521.54]  Do that
[2521.54 --> 2522.50]  The forum is
[2522.50 --> 2523.64]  Exactly like that
[2523.64 --> 2524.30]  We're like yeah
[2524.30 --> 2525.16]  We don't want you
[2525.16 --> 2525.66]  Talking about a
[2525.66 --> 2526.06]  Bunch of stuff
[2526.06 --> 2526.32]  Why
[2526.32 --> 2527.12]  Because we don't
[2527.12 --> 2528.12]  Want to deal with it
[2528.12 --> 2529.14]  This is not the
[2529.14 --> 2529.60]  Right place
[2529.60 --> 2530.02]  And this is
[2530.02 --> 2530.92]  Absolutely not the
[2530.92 --> 2531.42]  Right time
[2531.42 --> 2532.68]  Go somewhere else
[2532.68 --> 2534.62]  Like I don't know
[2534.62 --> 2535.26]  That's it
[2535.26 --> 2535.68]  It's gotten
[2535.68 --> 2536.66]  Phenomenally stupid
[2536.66 --> 2537.30]  To me though
[2537.30 --> 2538.22]  The kinds of things
[2538.22 --> 2539.14]  That have become
[2539.14 --> 2539.90]  Political
[2539.90 --> 2540.82]  Like remember when
[2540.82 --> 2541.98]  Gas ranges turned
[2541.98 --> 2543.04]  Into a political issue
[2543.04 --> 2543.54]  For like
[2543.54 --> 2544.46]  Everything's weird
[2544.46 --> 2545.48]  For like six minutes
[2545.48 --> 2546.34]  Earlier this year
[2546.34 --> 2546.36]  But this is why
[2546.36 --> 2547.34]  Neither of us do this
[2547.34 --> 2548.20]  And this is why
[2548.20 --> 2549.06]  This is too nuanced
[2549.06 --> 2549.54]  It's weird
[2549.54 --> 2550.62]  I'd rather just do
[2550.62 --> 2551.08]  Other stuff
[2551.08 --> 2552.52]  I hate content
[2552.52 --> 2553.28]  Moderation is such
[2553.28 --> 2553.72]  A nightmare
[2553.72 --> 2555.62]  Like no interest
[2555.62 --> 2556.00]  At all
[2556.00 --> 2556.74]  When we
[2556.74 --> 2557.48]  When we started
[2557.48 --> 2558.24]  Doing this like
[2558.24 --> 2559.72]  The 24 hour
[2559.72 --> 2560.46]  Livestream thing
[2560.46 --> 2563.24]  We were just
[2563.24 --> 2563.92]  Responsible for
[2563.92 --> 2564.48]  Like the tech
[2564.48 --> 2564.90]  Side of it
[2564.90 --> 2565.32]  So I wasn't
[2565.32 --> 2565.74]  Really thinking
[2565.74 --> 2566.42]  About much else
[2566.42 --> 2567.40]  Once it went
[2567.40 --> 2567.90]  Live
[2567.90 --> 2569.00]  I was like
[2569.00 --> 2569.48]  Oh
[2569.48 --> 2571.30]  Oh there's
[2571.30 --> 2571.76]  Gonna be a
[2571.76 --> 2572.14]  Chat
[2572.14 --> 2574.24]  Oh no
[2574.24 --> 2575.96]  And then went
[2575.96 --> 2576.52]  To go see that
[2576.52 --> 2577.20]  At that point in
[2577.20 --> 2577.68]  Time we had it
[2577.68 --> 2578.10]  Disabled
[2578.10 --> 2578.60]  And I was like
[2578.60 --> 2578.92]  Okay
[2578.92 --> 2580.02]  This makes sense
[2580.02 --> 2580.68]  It's kind of
[2580.68 --> 2581.38]  A weird viewing
[2581.38 --> 2581.72]  Experience
[2581.72 --> 2582.18]  Let's have
[2582.18 --> 2582.80]  Let's have
[2582.80 --> 2583.68]  A little
[2583.68 --> 2584.48]  Debate here
[2584.48 --> 2585.82]  I personally
[2585.82 --> 2586.54]  Intervened and
[2586.54 --> 2586.98]  Had the chat
[2586.98 --> 2587.72]  Turned back on
[2587.72 --> 2588.36]  Yeah
[2588.36 --> 2589.26]  No it should be
[2589.26 --> 2590.36]  Okay so hold on
[2590.36 --> 2590.88]  Hold on
[2590.88 --> 2591.80]  Cause that's gonna
[2591.80 --> 2592.44]  Sound weird
[2592.44 --> 2593.10]  Considering my
[2593.10 --> 2594.10]  Previous reaction
[2594.10 --> 2595.86]  I am going
[2595.86 --> 2596.70]  To be very
[2596.70 --> 2597.38]  Surprised
[2597.38 --> 2598.38]  If there are
[2598.38 --> 2599.16]  No issues
[2599.16 --> 2599.88]  With the fact
[2599.88 --> 2600.26]  That there is
[2600.26 --> 2601.02]  A live chat
[2601.02 --> 2601.46]  On there
[2601.46 --> 2602.32]  And I hope
[2602.32 --> 2603.36]  People understand
[2603.36 --> 2604.84]  That a 24 hour
[2604.84 --> 2605.48]  Livestream
[2605.48 --> 2606.36]  Is going to be
[2606.36 --> 2607.20]  Impossible to
[2607.20 --> 2608.14]  Perfectly moderate
[2608.14 --> 2608.52]  The chat
[2608.52 --> 2609.36]  So there's gonna
[2609.36 --> 2609.94]  Be some stuff
[2609.94 --> 2610.24]  In there
[2610.24 --> 2610.96]  That's gonna be
[2610.96 --> 2611.42]  Garbage
[2611.42 --> 2612.52]  Sorry
[2612.52 --> 2613.52]  It is what it is
[2613.52 --> 2614.56]  I expect it to be
[2614.56 --> 2616.22]  Basically all garbage
[2616.22 --> 2616.58]  Yeah
[2616.58 --> 2617.44]  Hopefully auto
[2617.44 --> 2618.22]  Moderator tools
[2618.22 --> 2618.86]  Are able to do
[2618.86 --> 2619.44]  A pretty good job
[2619.44 --> 2619.72]  With it
[2619.72 --> 2620.24]  But
[2620.24 --> 2621.72]  I expect nothing
[2621.72 --> 2622.68]  I expect it to
[2622.68 --> 2623.68]  Actually be garbage
[2623.68 --> 2624.26]  That is my
[2624.26 --> 2624.84]  Personal
[2624.84 --> 2626.12]  Linus Sebastian
[2626.12 --> 2627.22]  Guarantee to you
[2627.22 --> 2628.64]  That every message
[2628.64 --> 2629.40]  Even the one
[2629.40 --> 2629.82]  That you are
[2629.82 --> 2630.82]  Furiously typing
[2630.82 --> 2631.54]  Right now
[2631.54 --> 2632.30]  To demonstrate
[2632.30 --> 2633.56]  How galaxy
[2633.56 --> 2634.58]  Your brain is
[2634.58 --> 2635.86]  And how amazing
[2635.86 --> 2636.78]  The quality
[2636.78 --> 2637.32]  Of your

[2638.14 --> 2638.90]  Is going to be
[2638.90 --> 2639.84]  Is garbage
[2639.84 --> 2641.34]  Everything in that
[2641.34 --> 2641.68]  Live
[2641.68 --> 2643.00]  Everything in that
[2643.00 --> 2643.80]  Livestream chat
[2643.80 --> 2644.60]  Is garbage
[2644.60 --> 2645.44]  That is my
[2645.44 --> 2646.42]  Personal promise
[2646.42 --> 2647.18]  There
[2647.18 --> 2649.20]  Rebel against him
[2649.20 --> 2649.98]  By saying nice
[2649.98 --> 2650.68]  Things to people
[2650.68 --> 2652.16]  But yeah
[2652.16 --> 2652.42]  No
[2652.42 --> 2653.82]  Without the
[2653.82 --> 2654.44]  Live chat
[2654.44 --> 2656.44]  That thing is
[2656.44 --> 2657.64]  Literally useless
[2657.64 --> 2658.54]  Yeah
[2658.54 --> 2659.82]  You are actively
[2659.82 --> 2661.32]  On YouTube
[2661.32 --> 2663.98]  So
[2663.98 --> 2664.56]  I don't
[2664.56 --> 2665.12]  YouTube has
[2665.12 --> 2666.50]  Autoplay features
[2666.50 --> 2667.16]  I don't know
[2667.16 --> 2668.32]  How much I am
[2668.32 --> 2669.42]  Supposed to say
[2669.42 --> 2670.60]  Or not say
[2670.60 --> 2671.14]  About it
[2671.14 --> 2672.38]  But we are
[2672.38 --> 2673.90]  Trialing a new
[2673.90 --> 2674.94]  Beta thing
[2674.94 --> 2676.66]  Do you know
[2676.66 --> 2677.28]  What I am
[2677.28 --> 2677.84]  And I'm not
[2677.84 --> 2678.36]  Allowed to say
[2678.36 --> 2679.18]  I don't
[2679.18 --> 2680.64]  At all
[2680.64 --> 2682.06]  But when I
[2682.06 --> 2682.64]  Google it
[2682.64 --> 2683.72]  Nothing comes up
[2683.72 --> 2684.52]  I see
[2684.52 --> 2686.30]  Uh
[2686.30 --> 2687.10]  Okay
[2687.10 --> 2687.96]  So that's where
[2687.96 --> 2688.72]  I'm at right now
[2688.72 --> 2689.56]  Give me a sec
[2689.56 --> 2689.94]  Here
[2689.94 --> 2690.74]  Um
[2690.74 --> 2692.06]  Where do you find
[2692.06 --> 2692.94]  The 24 hour live stream
[2692.94 --> 2694.34]  If you go to
[2694.34 --> 2694.92]  The Linus
[2694.92 --> 2696.20]  Tech tips
[2696.20 --> 2696.68]  Channel
[2696.68 --> 2697.20]  On YouTube
[2697.20 --> 2697.56]  And then you
[2697.56 --> 2697.98]  Click on the
[2697.98 --> 2698.70]  Live button
[2698.70 --> 2699.40]  In the
[2699.40 --> 2700.14]  Top banner
[2700.14 --> 2700.50]  Thingy
[2700.50 --> 2701.30]  You will see
[2701.30 --> 2702.22]  Two live streams
[2702.22 --> 2702.60]  You'll see
[2702.60 --> 2702.96]  What you're
[2702.96 --> 2703.62]  Watching right now
[2703.62 --> 2704.06]  If you're on
[2704.06 --> 2704.42]  YouTube
[2704.42 --> 2705.36]  Um
[2705.36 --> 2706.16]  Well I mean
[2706.16 --> 2706.82]  You're going
[2706.82 --> 2707.80]  So yeah
[2707.80 --> 2708.20]  You'll see
[2708.20 --> 2708.84]  The WAN show
[2708.84 --> 2709.52]  That says
[2709.52 --> 2710.04]  What happened
[2710.04 --> 2710.70]  A big bold text
[2710.70 --> 2711.08]  To the bottom
[2711.08 --> 2711.34]  You can see
[2711.34 --> 2711.96]  These two guys
[2711.96 --> 2712.20]  There
[2712.20 --> 2712.80]  Uh
[2712.80 --> 2713.12]  And then to
[2713.12 --> 2713.48]  The right of
[2713.48 --> 2713.54]  It
[2713.54 --> 2713.78]  You'll see
[2713.78 --> 2714.30]  Another live
[2714.30 --> 2714.50]  Stream
[2714.50 --> 2714.84]  That just
[2714.84 --> 2715.00]  Says
[2715.00 --> 2715.86]  LTT TV
[2715.86 --> 2716.22]  Is the
[2716.22 --> 2716.62]  Thumbnail
[2716.62 --> 2717.78]  Um
[2717.78 --> 2718.52]  And
[2718.52 --> 2719.24]  Yeah
[2719.24 --> 2720.58]  LTT TV
[2720.58 --> 2721.30]  24 7
[2721.30 --> 2722.18]  Tech tips
[2722.18 --> 2722.90]  With a thousand
[2722.90 --> 2723.48]  People watching
[2723.48 --> 2724.02]  Okay
[2724.02 --> 2724.72]  Well
[2724.72 --> 2726.84]  They didn't
[2726.84 --> 2728.06]  Specifically say
[2728.06 --> 2729.46]  That it's
[2729.46 --> 2730.32]  NDA'd
[2730.32 --> 2731.48]  Yeah
[2731.48 --> 2732.38]  I didn't find
[2732.38 --> 2732.96]  Anything saying
[2732.96 --> 2733.38]  That either
[2733.38 --> 2734.18]  I just thought
[2734.18 --> 2734.62]  It was really
[2734.62 --> 2735.08]  Weird that
[2735.08 --> 2735.42]  When I
[2735.42 --> 2735.94]  Googled it
[2735.94 --> 2736.66]  I couldn't
[2736.66 --> 2737.26]  Find it
[2737.26 --> 2738.22]  Ah
[2738.22 --> 2738.86]  And there's
[2738.86 --> 2739.30]  No like
[2739.30 --> 2740.06]  Uh
[2740.06 --> 2740.34]  You know
[2740.34 --> 2741.12]  Like Google
[2741.12 --> 2741.88]  Knowledge base
[2741.88 --> 2742.68]  Documentation for
[2742.68 --> 2742.94]  It or
[2742.94 --> 2743.20]  Anything
[2743.20 --> 2743.90]  All the
[2743.90 --> 2744.60]  Documentation is
[2744.60 --> 2745.28]  Literally that
[2745.28 --> 2745.58]  That you're
[2745.58 --> 2745.86]  Looking at
[2745.86 --> 2746.18]  Right now
[2746.18 --> 2746.46]  Is that
[2746.46 --> 2746.82]  That's the
[2746.82 --> 2747.40]  PDF right
[2747.40 --> 2747.98]  Yeah
[2747.98 --> 2748.22]  I can only
[2748.22 --> 2748.60]  Sort of see
[2748.60 --> 2748.88]  Your phone
[2748.88 --> 2749.12]  Yeah
[2749.12 --> 2749.42]  And yeah
[2749.42 --> 2749.70]  That's
[2749.70 --> 2749.96]  That's
[2749.96 --> 2750.42]  Everything I
[2750.42 --> 2750.72]  Can find
[2750.72 --> 2750.86]  Okay
[2750.86 --> 2751.26]  Screw it
[2751.26 --> 2751.60]  I'm just
[2751.60 --> 2752.24]  Gonna say
[2752.24 --> 2752.58]  What it
[2752.58 --> 2753.00]  Is then
[2753.00 --> 2753.40]  Oh boy
[2753.40 --> 2753.72]  Uh
[2753.72 --> 2753.92]  We're
[2753.92 --> 2754.72]  Participating
[2754.72 --> 2755.64]  In a
[2755.64 --> 2756.18]  In a
[2756.18 --> 2756.64]  Trial
[2756.64 --> 2757.18]  That they're
[2757.18 --> 2757.54]  Doing
[2757.54 --> 2758.86]  Where it's
[2758.86 --> 2759.54]  It's
[2759.54 --> 2760.10]  I'm not
[2760.10 --> 2760.28]  Gonna
[2760.28 --> 2760.70]  I'm not
[2760.70 --> 2761.02]  Gonna say
[2761.02 --> 2761.32]  What it's
[2761.32 --> 2761.70]  Called
[2761.70 --> 2762.00]  Or give
[2762.00 --> 2762.26]  A ton
[2762.26 --> 2762.70]  Of detail
[2762.70 --> 2763.02]  But
[2763.02 --> 2763.32]  Okay
[2763.32 --> 2764.12]  It's
[2764.12 --> 2764.58]  Designed
[2764.58 --> 2765.06]  For TVs
[2765.06 --> 2766.18]  Yes
[2766.18 --> 2766.82]  So the
[2766.82 --> 2767.40]  Point of
[2767.40 --> 2767.72]  This
[2767.72 --> 2768.72]  Is for
[2768.72 --> 2769.58]  Us to
[2769.58 --> 2769.84]  Do the
[2769.84 --> 2770.38]  Curation
[2770.38 --> 2771.52]  Rather than
[2771.52 --> 2772.16]  For YouTube
[2772.16 --> 2772.64]  To do
[2772.64 --> 2773.36]  The curation
[2773.36 --> 2774.36]  And for
[2774.36 --> 2774.78]  Us to
[2774.78 --> 2775.44]  Basically go
[2775.44 --> 2775.76]  Okay
[2775.76 --> 2776.90]  Here's some
[2776.90 --> 2777.56]  Content that
[2777.56 --> 2777.94]  We think
[2777.94 --> 2778.72]  Represents
[2778.72 --> 2779.76]  The best
[2779.76 --> 2780.20]  Of
[2780.20 --> 2780.96]  Or like
[2780.96 --> 2782.80]  Things that
[2782.80 --> 2783.40]  Our audience
[2783.40 --> 2783.94]  Loves
[2783.94 --> 2784.92]  About our
[2784.92 --> 2785.32]  Brand
[2785.32 --> 2787.16]  And code
[2787.16 --> 2787.42]  It all
[2787.42 --> 2787.80]  Together
[2787.80 --> 2788.82]  And then
[2788.82 --> 2789.46]  Anytime
[2789.46 --> 2790.08]  On your
[2790.08 --> 2790.46]  TV
[2790.46 --> 2791.36]  You'll just
[2791.36 --> 2791.84]  See like
[2791.84 --> 2792.80]  LTT TV
[2792.80 --> 2793.48]  And it's
[2793.48 --> 2793.64]  Just
[2793.64 --> 2794.06]  It's more
[2794.06 --> 2794.58]  Like a
[2794.58 --> 2795.06]  Channel
[2795.06 --> 2795.38]  It's like a
[2795.38 --> 2795.72]  Station
[2795.72 --> 2796.04]  Yeah
[2796.04 --> 2796.36]  Yeah
[2796.36 --> 2797.10]  And less
[2797.10 --> 2798.18]  Like an
[2798.18 --> 2798.82]  Algorithm
[2798.82 --> 2799.70]  Because it's
[2799.70 --> 2800.60]  Not algorithmic
[2800.60 --> 2801.32]  Which
[2801.32 --> 2803.16]  Kind of
[2803.16 --> 2803.82]  Surprised me
[2803.82 --> 2804.46]  Yeah
[2804.46 --> 2804.80]  Me too
[2804.80 --> 2805.78]  Like what
[2805.78 --> 2806.72]  That's
[2806.72 --> 2807.72]  That's like
[2807.72 --> 2808.52]  The anti
[2808.52 --> 2809.72]  Google
[2809.72 --> 2810.60]  Thing to do
[2810.60 --> 2810.80]  Yeah
[2810.80 --> 2811.08]  It's weird
[2811.08 --> 2812.36]  And so
[2812.36 --> 2813.02]  Obviously
[2813.02 --> 2813.48]  Yeah
[2813.48 --> 2813.98]  I was
[2813.98 --> 2814.42]  I was
[2814.42 --> 2814.72]  Really
[2814.72 --> 2815.42]  Interested
[2815.42 --> 2816.24]  In participating
[2816.24 --> 2817.32]  In it
[2817.32 --> 2817.76]  Just to
[2817.76 --> 2818.08]  Kind of
[2818.08 --> 2818.48]  See
[2818.48 --> 2820.14]  You know
[2820.14 --> 2820.38]  What does
[2820.38 --> 2820.72]  That look
[2820.72 --> 2820.94]  Like
[2820.94 --> 2821.40]  Is there
[2821.40 --> 2822.18]  Is
[2822.18 --> 2822.84]  Is there
[2822.84 --> 2823.78]  Is this
[2823.78 --> 2824.20]  A potential
[2824.20 --> 2824.64]  Funnel
[2824.64 --> 2825.40]  To bring
[2825.40 --> 2825.92]  New people
[2825.92 --> 2826.44]  Into LTT
[2826.44 --> 2826.88]  Content
[2826.88 --> 2827.48]  Is to
[2827.48 --> 2828.44]  To expose
[2828.44 --> 2829.20]  Videos from
[2829.20 --> 2829.56]  The back
[2829.56 --> 2830.14]  Catalog
[2830.14 --> 2830.78]  That haven't
[2830.78 --> 2831.30]  Been picked up
[2831.30 --> 2832.10]  Algorithmically
[2832.10 --> 2832.98]  At least
[2832.98 --> 2833.72]  Not recently
[2833.72 --> 2834.42]  Right
[2834.42 --> 2834.98]  Like I
[2834.98 --> 2837.04]  I don't know
[2837.04 --> 2838.68]  So we actually
[2838.68 --> 2839.26]  It was a ton
[2839.26 --> 2839.88]  Of work for the
[2839.88 --> 2840.18]  Team
[2840.18 --> 2840.96]  Everyone from
[2840.96 --> 2841.44]  The editors
[2841.44 --> 2842.60]  To Luke's team
[2842.60 --> 2843.50]  To the business
[2843.50 --> 2843.96]  Team
[2843.96 --> 2844.92]  To the writing
[2844.92 --> 2845.30]  Team
[2845.30 --> 2845.74]  Like getting
[2845.74 --> 2846.00]  Every
[2846.00 --> 2846.46]  Getting all
[2846.46 --> 2846.90]  These videos
[2846.90 --> 2847.58]  Selected
[2847.58 --> 2847.88]  And
[2847.88 --> 2849.44]  Originally we
[2849.44 --> 2849.80]  Were actually
[2849.80 --> 2850.22]  Going to cut
[2850.22 --> 2850.76]  Them together
[2850.76 --> 2851.92]  With baked in
[2851.92 --> 2853.44]  We recorded
[2853.44 --> 2854.52]  The business
[2854.52 --> 2855.16]  Team including
[2855.16 --> 2855.92]  Dennis recorded
[2855.92 --> 2856.36]  Like some
[2856.36 --> 2857.48]  New spots
[2857.48 --> 2857.82]  Oh those are
[2857.82 --> 2858.16]  In there I
[2858.16 --> 2858.36]  Think
[2858.36 --> 2858.72]  Yeah
[2858.72 --> 2859.86]  But how do
[2859.86 --> 2860.50]  Those work
[2860.50 --> 2861.02]  Do they just
[2861.02 --> 2861.66]  Randomly play
[2861.66 --> 2862.24]  Once in a while
[2862.24 --> 2862.62]  Or are they
[2862.62 --> 2863.18]  Encoded with
[2863.18 --> 2863.50]  Videos
[2863.50 --> 2863.98]  No I think
[2863.98 --> 2864.38]  It's each
[2864.38 --> 2865.38]  Individual video
[2865.38 --> 2866.22]  Has it slotted
[2866.22 --> 2867.34]  Into that same
[2867.34 --> 2867.76]  Video
[2867.76 --> 2868.32]  Okay so
[2868.32 --> 2868.94]  We had
[2868.94 --> 2870.82]  Proposed an
[2870.82 --> 2871.16]  Idea
[2871.16 --> 2871.94]  Oh okay
[2871.94 --> 2872.92]  Where we were
[2872.92 --> 2873.30]  Going to have
[2873.30 --> 2873.96]  Those ads go
[2873.96 --> 2874.56]  Between the
[2874.56 --> 2874.90]  Videos
[2874.90 --> 2875.70]  But it was
[2875.70 --> 2876.42]  Brought up by
[2876.42 --> 2877.48]  James that
[2877.48 --> 2877.82]  Like the
[2877.82 --> 2878.48]  Floatplane audience
[2878.48 --> 2879.14]  Is used to
[2879.14 --> 2879.84]  The ads being
[2879.84 --> 2880.44]  Removed
[2880.44 --> 2881.58]  So sometimes
[2881.58 --> 2882.32]  You'll do
[2882.32 --> 2882.72]  Your like
[2882.72 --> 2883.12]  We're going to
[2883.12 --> 2883.52]  Segway to
[2883.52 --> 2883.96]  Our sponsor
[2883.96 --> 2884.50]  Thing and
[2884.50 --> 2885.56]  Then the
[2885.56 --> 2885.94]  Video will
[2885.94 --> 2886.36]  Just keep
[2886.36 --> 2886.76]  Playing and
[2886.76 --> 2887.06]  There's no
[2887.06 --> 2887.30]  Ad
[2887.30 --> 2887.90]  The floatplane
[2887.90 --> 2888.32]  Audience is
[2888.32 --> 2888.56]  Used to
[2888.56 --> 2888.96]  That because
[2888.96 --> 2889.40]  They're like
[2889.40 --> 2889.84]  Paying for
[2889.84 --> 2890.30]  That and
[2890.30 --> 2890.82]  That's normal
[2890.82 --> 2891.18]  And stuff
[2891.18 --> 2892.30]  But average
[2892.30 --> 2892.78]  Viewers might
[2892.78 --> 2893.14]  Think that's
[2893.14 --> 2893.56]  A little weird
[2893.56 --> 2894.04]  And a little
[2894.04 --> 2894.38]  Jarring
[2894.38 --> 2895.36]  So we
[2895.36 --> 2895.94]  Want he
[2895.94 --> 2896.34]  Wanted the
[2896.34 --> 2896.74]  Ads to
[2896.74 --> 2897.44]  Be slotted
[2897.44 --> 2897.86]  In there
[2897.86 --> 2898.52]  So each
[2898.52 --> 2898.92]  Video on
[2898.92 --> 2899.10]  There is
[2899.10 --> 2899.74]  Actually edited
[2899.74 --> 2900.12]  With the
[2900.12 --> 2900.62]  Ad slotted
[2900.62 --> 2900.86]  In
[2900.86 --> 2902.90]  Oh okay
[2902.90 --> 2903.30]  That sounds
[2903.30 --> 2903.56]  Like it
[2903.56 --> 2903.92]  Was a lot
[2903.92 --> 2904.28]  Of work
[2904.28 --> 2905.00]  Yeah which
[2905.00 --> 2905.36]  Is why
[2905.36 --> 2906.00]  We recommended
[2906.00 --> 2906.50]  Just putting
[2906.50 --> 2906.74]  It in
[2906.74 --> 2906.96]  Between
[2906.96 --> 2907.72]  But if
[2907.72 --> 2908.10]  The viewing
[2908.10 --> 2908.66]  Experience is
[2908.66 --> 2909.00]  Better or
[2909.00 --> 2909.20]  Whatever
[2909.20 --> 2909.64]  That's
[2909.64 --> 2910.20]  James
[2910.20 --> 2910.98]  Shout out
[2910.98 --> 2911.90]  Editing team
[2911.90 --> 2912.82]  For getting
[2912.82 --> 2913.32]  That done
[2913.32 --> 2914.52]  Dan you know
[2914.52 --> 2914.84]  We've done
[2914.84 --> 2915.60]  Three topics
[2915.60 --> 2916.22]  Already right
[2916.22 --> 2922.12]  It's just
[2922.12 --> 2922.48]  Based on
[2922.48 --> 2922.94]  The time
[2922.94 --> 2924.98]  Really
[2924.98 --> 2925.72]  We were

[3007.88 --> 3008.18]  Way
[3008.18 --> 3008.88]  Or
[3008.88 --> 3009.20]  Something
[3009.20 --> 3009.40]  I
[3009.40 --> 3009.66]  Remember
[3009.66 --> 3009.84]  You

[3010.68 --> 3011.02]  Can
[3011.02 --> 3011.34]  Sort
[3011.34 --> 3011.76]  It's
[3011.76 --> 3012.00]  It's
[3012.00 --> 3012.48]  Closed
[3012.48 --> 3012.80]  So we
[3012.80 --> 3013.08]  Can't
[3013.08 --> 3013.42]  Change
[3013.42 --> 3013.60]  It

[3014.86 --> 3015.16]  Sort
[3015.16 --> 3015.34]  Them
[3015.34 --> 3015.74]  But some

[3015.86 --> 3015.98]  The
[3015.98 --> 3016.32]  Sorting
[3016.32 --> 3016.46]  Is
[3016.46 --> 3016.68]  Really
[3016.68 --> 3016.98]  Weird
[3016.98 --> 3017.72]  Like you
[3017.72 --> 3018.40]  Particularly
[3018.40 --> 3018.86]  Hated
[3018.86 --> 3019.10]  This
[3019.10 --> 3019.30]  One
[3019.30 --> 3019.54]  If you
[3019.54 --> 3019.72]  Sort
[3019.72 --> 3019.88]  By
[3019.88 --> 3020.18]  Most
[3020.18 --> 3020.68]  Helpful
[3020.68 --> 3021.34]  Yeah
[3021.34 --> 3021.76]  All
[3021.76 --> 3021.94]  It

[3023.38 --> 3023.78]  Likes
[3023.78 --> 3024.48]  Yeah
[3024.48 --> 3024.58]  It
[3024.58 --> 3024.86]  Doesn't
[3024.86 --> 3025.24]  Consider
[3025.24 --> 3025.46]  The

[3025.92 --> 3026.16]  At
[3026.16 --> 3026.44]  All
[3026.44 --> 3026.80]  So
[3026.80 --> 3027.04]  Something
[3027.04 --> 3027.20]  Could
[3027.20 --> 3027.36]  Have
[3027.36 --> 3027.60]  Like

[3031.30 --> 3031.32]  Will
[3031.32 --> 3031.38]  Be
[3031.38 --> 3031.52]  Like
[3031.52 --> 3031.72]  This
[3031.72 --> 3031.84]  Is
[3031.84 --> 3031.98]  The

[3033.36 --> 3034.28]  Which
[3034.28 --> 3034.42]  Is
[3034.42 --> 3034.84]  Very
[3034.84 --> 3035.16]  Very
[3035.16 --> 3035.56]  Bad
[3035.56 --> 3035.94]  That
[3035.94 --> 3036.10]  Might

[3036.42 --> 3036.68]  Be
[3036.68 --> 3037.12]  Helpful
[3037.12 --> 3037.52]  Now
[3037.52 --> 3037.62]  That
[3037.62 --> 3037.64]  I
[3037.64 --> 3037.84]  Think

[3038.56 --> 3038.88]  But
[3038.88 --> 3039.38]  That
[3039.38 --> 3039.74]  That
[3039.74 --> 3039.96]  Math
[3039.96 --> 3040.30]  Often
[3040.30 --> 3040.58]  Doesn't
[3040.58 --> 3040.82]  Work

[3367.08 --> 3367.20]  Don't
[3367.20 --> 3367.38]  Even
[3367.38 --> 3367.56]  Think
[3367.56 --> 3367.70]  We're
[3371.76 --> 3372.14]  Almost
[3372.14 --> 3372.42]  Never
[3372.42 --> 3372.72]  Find
[3372.72 --> 3372.92]  Any
[3372.92 --> 3373.14]  Good
[3373.14 --> 3373.64]  Deals
[3373.64 --> 3374.34]  Why
[3374.34 --> 3374.50]  Does
[3374.50 --> 3374.60]  The
[3374.60 --> 3374.82]  Community
[3374.82 --> 3375.06]  Hate
[3375.06 --> 3375.16]  It
[3375.16 --> 3375.28]  Just
[3375.28 --> 3375.44]  Because
[3375.44 --> 3375.64]  There's
[3375.64 --> 3375.74]  No
[3375.74 --> 3375.92]  Good
[3375.92 --> 3376.14]  Deals
[3376.14 --> 3376.94]  Um
[3376.94 --> 3377.14]  Just
[3377.14 --> 3377.46]  Because
[3377.46 --> 3377.80]  Like
[3377.80 --> 3378.34]  What's
[3378.34 --> 3378.46]  There
[3378.46 --> 3378.56]  To
[3378.56 --> 3378.74]  Not
[3378.74 --> 3378.94]  Hate
[3378.94 --> 3379.14]  About
[3379.14 --> 3379.52]  Amazon
[3379.52 --> 3379.74]  Is
[3379.74 --> 3379.82]  It
[3379.82 --> 3379.96]  Like
[3379.96 --> 3380.16]  I
[3380.16 --> 3380.82]  I
[3380.82 --> 3381.54]  Legitimately
[3381.54 --> 3382.06]  Don't
[3382.06 --> 3382.56]  Shop
[3382.56 --> 3382.72]  On
[3382.72 --> 3382.98]  Amazon
[3382.98 --> 3383.18]  So
[3383.18 --> 3383.32]  I
[3383.32 --> 3383.82]  Don't
[3383.82 --> 3384.62]  Is
[3384.62 --> 3384.72]  It
[3384.72 --> 3384.86]  Like
[3384.86 --> 3385.02]  The
[3385.02 --> 3385.30]  Steam
[3385.30 --> 3385.60]  Sale
[3385.60 --> 3386.60]  Where
[3386.60 --> 3386.78]  Like
[3386.78 --> 3386.94]  The
[3386.94 --> 3387.22]  First
[3387.22 --> 3387.46]  Few
[3387.46 --> 3387.64]  Were
[3387.64 --> 3387.94]  Sick
[3387.94 --> 3388.10]  And
[3388.10 --> 3388.26]  Now
[3388.26 --> 3388.48]  All
[3388.48 --> 3388.68]  Them
[3388.68 --> 3388.92]  They're
[3388.92 --> 3389.08]  Just
[3389.08 --> 3389.20]  All
[3389.20 --> 3389.36]  The
[3389.36 --> 3389.60]  Same
[3389.60 --> 3389.76]  As
[3389.76 --> 3389.92]  They
[3389.92 --> 3390.06]  Were
[3390.06 --> 3390.38]  Before
[3390.38 --> 3390.74]  I
[3390.74 --> 3390.88]  Don't
[3390.88 --> 3391.04]  Even
[3391.04 --> 3391.20]  Know
[3391.20 --> 3391.32]  If
[3391.32 --> 3391.46]  The
[3391.46 --> 3391.70]  First
[3391.70 --> 3391.98]  Prime
[3391.98 --> 3392.14]  Day
[3392.14 --> 3392.34]  Was
[3392.34 --> 3392.62]  Sick
[3392.62 --> 3394.62]  I
[3394.62 --> 3395.06]  Mean
[3395.06 --> 3395.36]  It's
[3395.36 --> 3395.58]  It's
[3395.58 --> 3395.68]  One
[3395.68 --> 3395.76]  Of
[3395.76 --> 3395.92]  Those
[3395.92 --> 3396.16]  Things
[3396.16 --> 3396.40]  Where
[3396.40 --> 3396.86]  From
[3396.86 --> 3397.10]  Time
[3397.10 --> 3397.24]  To
[3397.24 --> 3397.50]  Time
[3397.50 --> 3397.84]  There
[3397.84 --> 3398.04]  Are
[3398.04 --> 3398.26]  Good
[3398.26 --> 3398.66]  Deals
[3398.66 --> 3399.00]  Oh
[3399.00 --> 3399.26]  That's
[3399.26 --> 3399.36]  A
[3399.36 --> 3399.56]  Really
[3399.56 --> 3399.78]  Good
[3399.78 --> 3400.16]  Question
[3400.16 --> 3400.46]  Oh
[3400.46 --> 3400.64]  What
[3400.64 --> 3400.76]  Is
[3400.76 --> 3401.02]  It
[3401.02 --> 3401.44]  AJ
[3401.44 --> 3401.58]  In
[3401.58 --> 3401.86]  Floatplane
[3401.86 --> 3402.06]  Chat
[3402.06 --> 3402.24]  Said
[3402.24 --> 3402.34]  If
[3420.88 --> 3420.90]  The
[3420.90 --> 3421.06]  Next
[3421.06 --> 3421.28]  Couple
[3421.28 --> 3421.60]  Days
[3421.60 --> 3421.78]  So
[3421.78 --> 3421.90]  I'm
[3421.90 --> 3421.98]  Going
[3421.98 --> 3422.02]  To
[3422.02 --> 3422.14]  Be
[3422.14 --> 3422.48]  Honest
[3422.48 --> 3422.68]  With
[3422.68 --> 3422.88]  You
[3422.88 --> 3423.52]  In
[3423.52 --> 3423.64]  A
[3423.64 --> 3423.82]  Way
[3423.82 --> 3424.22]  That
[3424.22 --> 3425.54]  I'm
[3425.54 --> 3425.72]  Sure
[3425.72 --> 3425.90]  Our
[3425.90 --> 3426.08]  New
[3426.08 --> 3426.42]  CEO
[3426.42 --> 3426.84]  Would
[3426.84 --> 3427.22]  Actually
[3427.22 --> 3427.56]  Not
[3427.56 --> 3427.84]  Really
[3427.84 --> 3428.34]  Appreciate
[3428.34 --> 3428.84]  Because
[3428.84 --> 3429.38]  This
[3429.38 --> 3429.52]  Is
[3429.52 --> 3429.76]  Pretty
[3429.76 --> 3430.24]  Inside
[3430.24 --> 3430.76]  Baseball
[3430.76 --> 3432.02]  Our
[3432.02 --> 3432.58]  Intention
[3432.58 --> 3433.38]  Is
[3433.38 --> 3433.66]  To
[3433.66 --> 3434.24]  Combine
[3434.24 --> 3434.70]  Shipments
[3434.70 --> 3434.88]  If
[3434.88 --> 3435.04]  We
[3435.04 --> 3435.38]  Can
[3435.38 --> 3435.82]  Okay
[3435.82 --> 3436.10]  And
[3436.10 --> 3436.36]  Pocket
[3436.36 --> 3436.54]  The
[3436.54 --> 3436.88]  Difference
[3436.88 --> 3437.24]  Because
[3437.24 --> 3437.80]  We
[3437.80 --> 3437.94]  Are
[3437.94 --> 3438.18]  Going
[3438.18 --> 3438.72]  Extremely
[3438.72 --> 3439.16]  Aggressive
[3439.16 --> 3439.38]  On
[3439.38 --> 3439.56]  These
[3439.56 --> 3439.90]  Deals
[3439.90 --> 3440.24]  And
[3440.24 --> 3440.42]  You're
[3440.42 --> 3440.60]  Still
[3440.60 --> 3440.82]  Getting
[3440.82 --> 3440.96]  A
[3440.98 --> 3441.08]  Good
[3441.08 --> 3441.34]  Deal
[3441.34 --> 3441.82]  Okay
[3441.82 --> 3443.86]  That
[3443.86 --> 3444.06]  May
[3444.06 --> 3444.20]  Be
[3444.20 --> 3444.44]  One
[3444.44 --> 3444.56]  Of
[3444.56 --> 3444.68]  The
[3444.68 --> 3444.90]  Few
[3450.88 --> 3451.02]  Wow.
[3452.68 --> 3454.04]  I mean...
[3454.04 --> 3454.88]  So there you go, buddy.
[3455.16 --> 3455.92]  I mean...
[3455.92 --> 3458.58]  This is a thing that places do.
[3458.62 --> 3462.84]  In the interest of protecting the environment and consuming less jet fuel...
[3462.84 --> 3465.50]  I mean, it is literally just better for people, right?
[3465.50 --> 3470.00]  We have made the difficult decision to not bill you any differently and combine your shipments.
[3470.02 --> 3475.96]  You don't have to have a delivery person show up to your house and fake knock on your door and then leave multiple times.
[3476.04 --> 3476.78]  Now it's only once.
[3476.80 --> 3477.24]  Now it's once.
[3477.26 --> 3478.98]  So you only have to go to the post office one time.
[3478.98 --> 3479.48]  So...
[3479.48 --> 3484.12]  In other...
[3484.12 --> 3485.70]  I don't think it's that bad.
[3485.76 --> 3486.30]  I think it's fine.
[3490.50 --> 3492.42]  In other news...
[3492.42 --> 3492.74]  Yeah.
[3492.88 --> 3494.04]  The goat story, I think.
[3494.36 --> 3496.18]  You just don't want to do any merch messages?
[3496.46 --> 3497.70]  You just explained the whole thing.
[3497.80 --> 3498.02]  Oh, no, it's explaining.
[3499.46 --> 3500.92]  Your note sucks, Dan.
[3501.06 --> 3502.58]  Yeah, get a better note, Dan.
[3502.58 --> 3502.82]  Yeah.
[3503.24 --> 3503.64]  Yeah.
[3503.72 --> 3507.74]  If we were to do merch messages, it should say explain merch messages plus do three.
[3507.74 --> 3509.20]  I can't work with these people.
[3510.28 --> 3512.14]  We normally do two merch messages.
[3512.36 --> 3513.94]  How long have we been doing this together now?
[3515.56 --> 3517.26]  A thousand years.
[3518.64 --> 3519.26]  Hit me, Dan.
[3519.36 --> 3520.72]  Always feels like the first time.
[3521.80 --> 3522.28]  Hi, DLL.
[3522.48 --> 3523.12]  Love the show.
[3523.30 --> 3529.80]  Apple grew into nearby buildings in its early years, like LTT, and eventually built a unified campus.
[3530.20 --> 3531.52]  Do you think LTT can get there?
[3531.52 --> 3533.94]  Taren, what's your dream of LTT under one roof?
[3534.48 --> 3538.74]  I think that sounds like a problem for our incoming CEO to deal with.
[3538.92 --> 3548.96]  I have actually explicitly already talked to multiple people internally about our space constraints, including Taren, and said that I do not intend to deal with it.
[3548.96 --> 3554.70]  I don't think it's realistic for us to keep buying buildings.
[3554.82 --> 3556.72]  I mean, we've talked about that on the WAN show before.
[3557.04 --> 3559.72]  It's just reached the point now where...
[3560.92 --> 3563.00]  We're in BC, man.
[3563.18 --> 3564.58]  It just doesn't work.
[3564.64 --> 3568.60]  Yeah, the costs just go up higher than you can save up money at a certain point.
[3568.60 --> 3570.06]  It's like how real estate works in BC.
[3570.06 --> 3572.92]  And how much space we would need.
[3573.26 --> 3577.30]  Like, you could even look at the badminton building and go, well, Linus, you could have just bought us the badminton building.
[3577.34 --> 3577.98]  No, I couldn't.
[3578.72 --> 3584.22]  The badminton building would not be enough to accommodate LMG in its current state.
[3584.22 --> 3586.14]  It's also not like zoned for office space and stuff, right?
[3586.14 --> 3586.32]  Yeah.
[3586.46 --> 3586.66]  Yeah.
[3586.92 --> 3587.36]  Exactly.
[3587.68 --> 3588.28]  It wouldn't really work.
[3588.40 --> 3591.12]  And office is even more expensive.
[3591.36 --> 3594.98]  So we would have to be getting an office zoned building.
[3594.98 --> 3604.98]  It would have to be like, we're already, we are already occupying something like 55,000 square feet or something like that.
[3605.12 --> 3609.18]  I don't know what that is in like real units, but because I'm Canadian.
[3610.06 --> 3611.32]  But it's a lot.
[3611.50 --> 3612.08]  It's a ton.
[3612.08 --> 3621.08]  And so for us to move everything, consolidate everything, and then also have like a reasonable amount of room to grow.
[3621.08 --> 3625.22]  We'd be basically looking at a hundred thousand square foot campus.
[3625.58 --> 3626.30]  There is a solution.
[3626.98 --> 3627.42]  What?
[3628.26 --> 3629.52]  Just a company town.
[3630.40 --> 3631.46]  You're pitching this again?
[3631.46 --> 3632.40]  Because you can't move.
[3632.74 --> 3634.34]  You can't convince everyone.
[3634.54 --> 3635.74]  We're bringing back Linus bucks.
[3635.86 --> 3645.98]  Like if you tried to move the entire company to somewhere a little bit, you know, further away from Vancouver, it's going to be really hard because every single person in the company is going to have to figure out housing at the same time.
[3645.98 --> 3651.60]  What if you just provided that solution for them at the same time?
[3652.66 --> 3653.86]  Guaranteed renters.
[3654.36 --> 3655.58]  Internet would be sick.
[3657.82 --> 3660.46]  We might as well just provide free IT services.
[3660.72 --> 3675.86]  The hilarious part of this is there are legitimately, like in BC, in the province where we live, towns where you, someone like me could realistically roll up and actually just be like, I'll take it.
[3676.10 --> 3676.24]  Yep.
[3677.86 --> 3683.84]  Not because I have like billionaire money, but because they are actually worthless.
[3684.30 --> 3684.44]  Yeah.
[3684.62 --> 3687.12]  The best part of the joke is how realistic it is.
[3687.70 --> 3688.06]  Yeah.
[3688.22 --> 3688.96]  That's not happening.
[3689.36 --> 3689.70]  That's not happening.
[3689.76 --> 3691.04]  No one would want to live there, Luke.
[3691.82 --> 3692.86]  Speak for yourself.
[3694.84 --> 3696.38]  You two are not.
[3696.38 --> 3697.58]  Luke and I living in the woods.
[3697.58 --> 3697.74]  Yeah.
[3698.98 --> 3699.60]  That's it.
[3699.96 --> 3700.44]  Let's go.
[3700.78 --> 3700.94]  Yeah.
[3701.08 --> 3701.48]  Let's go.
[3701.68 --> 3701.78]  Yeah.
[3701.94 --> 3702.26]  Oh, yeah.
[3702.26 --> 3708.40]  The opportunity to own a significant amount of land for this many people in BC would probably be cool.
[3708.80 --> 3711.78]  My favorite part about this is I know it actually annoys you.
[3719.58 --> 3720.68]  Jayden in Floatplane Chat.
[3720.68 --> 3721.50]  We live in Vancouver.
[3721.82 --> 3722.74]  Obviously, we would.
[3722.98 --> 3723.22]  See?
[3724.50 --> 3724.90]  See?
[3725.82 --> 3726.22]  Hey.
[3727.20 --> 3727.54]  Hey.
[3728.14 --> 3728.46]  Okay.
[3728.56 --> 3731.60]  But I get to be the cult leader and I have like sex slaves, right?
[3731.90 --> 3732.76]  This is fine.
[3733.02 --> 3733.66]  It already is.
[3733.76 --> 3734.34]  That's basically.
[3734.62 --> 3736.14]  That's probably already happening there.
[3741.14 --> 3742.72]  Yvonne might take issue with that.
[3742.84 --> 3743.24]  Maybe.
[3743.42 --> 3743.60]  Yeah.
[3744.24 --> 3745.88]  I mean, not if they're male.
[3746.08 --> 3747.20]  I don't think she'd care about that.
[3747.20 --> 3747.44]  Okay.
[3747.82 --> 3748.06]  Yeah.
[3748.22 --> 3748.40]  Yeah.
[3748.48 --> 3749.70]  Well, we know.
[3750.64 --> 3751.00]  We do?
[3751.52 --> 3752.20]  Oh, my God.
[3753.86 --> 3754.92]  You're not a slave.
[3759.56 --> 3760.42]  You get paid.
[3763.72 --> 3764.42]  Oh, my goodness.
[3764.42 --> 3764.86]  All right.
[3767.66 --> 3768.10]  Anywho.
[3768.60 --> 3771.04]  I got one more for you here, I guess.
[3772.44 --> 3773.82]  Unless you'd like to move on.
[3775.54 --> 3776.56]  Both would be okay.
[3777.20 --> 3778.90]  No, we can do one more.
[3779.14 --> 3780.50]  Hey, LL&D.
[3781.14 --> 3788.36]  Linus, why do most people prefer NVIDIA's DLSS, limited to NVIDIA cards, over the more accessible
[3788.36 --> 3795.58]  FSR, which is universal and open source, like XESS, despite not working equally on competitor
[3795.58 --> 3796.12]  products?
[3796.20 --> 3798.36]  Because it's better and people like things that are better.
[3798.98 --> 3799.28]  Yeah.
[3799.28 --> 3799.42]  Yeah.
[3799.94 --> 3807.58]  The open source community loves to be like, okay, we've got a comparison matrix.
[3808.12 --> 3808.30]  Okay.
[3808.38 --> 3809.08]  Feature one.
[3809.44 --> 3809.70]  Check.
[3809.80 --> 3810.14]  Check.
[3810.38 --> 3811.10]  Feature two.
[3811.26 --> 3811.44]  Check.
[3811.52 --> 3811.74]  Check.
[3811.84 --> 3812.34]  Feature three.
[3812.50 --> 3812.66]  Check.
[3812.74 --> 3813.04]  Check.
[3813.22 --> 3813.86]  Feature four.
[3813.94 --> 3814.82]  Is it open source?
[3815.02 --> 3815.24]  Check.
[3815.40 --> 3816.22]  Not check.
[3816.50 --> 3817.42]  Not check.
[3817.66 --> 3818.14]  Bad.
[3819.04 --> 3821.64]  It's really not that black and white, guys.
[3821.72 --> 3823.40]  That has some legitimacy to it.
[3823.46 --> 3829.22]  It can be great, especially if you happen to have a development team that can massage that
[3829.22 --> 3831.94]  open source thing into something that works really great for you.
[3831.94 --> 3835.26]  Or if it's a security project, so you want the transparency.
[3835.58 --> 3836.30]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3838.12 --> 3839.82]  But no.
[3840.46 --> 3845.06]  FSR is not as good as DLSS, at least not at this time.
[3845.62 --> 3855.58]  And there's a subset of people out there that actually will pay more for an experience that,
[3855.74 --> 3858.60]  in some cases, is just one that they perceive to be better.
[3858.60 --> 3862.24]  It doesn't even necessarily matter if it's actually better.
[3862.48 --> 3869.50]  People don't mind paying extra for something that they feel is better.
[3869.66 --> 3871.32]  And in this case, they're right.
[3871.62 --> 3873.22]  It is better.
[3874.00 --> 3875.04]  So that's why.
[3875.34 --> 3876.56]  That's the answer.
[3876.94 --> 3885.72]  And I would love for FSR to take off to the point where it really is a legitimately feature
[3885.72 --> 3888.74]  complete equivalent solution.
[3889.42 --> 3895.08]  But as far as I can tell, didn't AMD have an FSR update or something that was supposed
[3895.08 --> 3898.50]  to add AI or frame generation or something?
[3898.72 --> 3904.68]  Like, wasn't FSR supposed to get an update in Q2 that it is not Q2 anymore?
[3905.10 --> 3908.14]  And AMD FSR Q2 update or something.
[3908.20 --> 3908.50]  Hold on.
[3908.50 --> 3911.50]  And then they just like went quiet on it.
[3912.18 --> 3914.16]  Guys, let me know.
[3914.72 --> 3915.16]  Let me know.
[3916.08 --> 3920.16]  Ryuk says, yet again, AMD FUD and pro NVIDIA statements getting tiring.
[3920.54 --> 3922.38]  No, actually, you're getting tiring.
[3922.58 --> 3924.50]  We literally didn't say anything about...
[3924.50 --> 3927.42]  We literally only said things that are just objectively true.
[3927.62 --> 3929.38]  I'm so sorry you're upset.
[3929.38 --> 3935.04]  This is another consistent thing.
[3935.30 --> 3938.30]  There's positives and negatives and there's personality types in all communities.
[3939.12 --> 3942.66]  I love a very large amount of the open source community, but that's another problem.
[3942.74 --> 3947.54]  Or if you don't like it, it's just like, oh, you are now automatically evil.
[3947.90 --> 3948.70]  It's like, oh, hold on.
[3951.12 --> 3952.86]  Someone in chat said...
[3952.86 --> 3953.54]  Yeah, I can't find it.
[3954.18 --> 3955.20]  It's not FSR though.
[3955.20 --> 3960.28]  The town would obviously be called LMG, also known as Linus Municipal Government.
[3962.14 --> 3964.86]  I mean, we wouldn't call the town that, but...
[3964.86 --> 3965.56]  The government, yeah.
[3965.56 --> 3967.02]  That could be on my business card.
[3967.14 --> 3967.34]  Yeah.
[3968.46 --> 3969.78]  Linus Municipal Government, sure.
[3974.04 --> 3976.80]  Omnipotent God Power at Linus Municipal Government.
[3979.10 --> 3982.06]  I think we still have to follow federal and provincial laws.
[3982.36 --> 3982.98]  Ah, darn.
[3983.08 --> 3983.90]  Not with that attitude.
[3983.90 --> 3985.32]  We just got to move further out.
[3985.56 --> 3991.60]  But my understanding is the way the cult towns get around that is all the local law enforcement
[3991.60 --> 3993.42]  just doesn't talk to outsiders.
[3993.82 --> 3993.96]  Yeah.
[3994.54 --> 3994.96]  Perfect.
[3995.14 --> 3995.44]  Yeah.
[3995.44 --> 3997.08]  That's apparently the move.
[3997.92 --> 3998.10]  Yeah.
[3998.28 --> 3998.48]  Yeah.
[3998.48 --> 3998.66]  Yeah.
[4000.80 --> 4001.20]  Yeah.
[4001.86 --> 4006.60]  No one in chat has told me what that thing was that we're supposed to get an update on
[4006.60 --> 4007.40]  some feature.
[4007.58 --> 4008.06]  Come on, guys.
[4008.70 --> 4009.48]  Ah, forget it.
[4009.58 --> 4010.02]  I give up.
[4010.02 --> 4014.56]  All right, Dan.
[4014.90 --> 4016.42]  Oh, you want us to do two more topics?
[4016.62 --> 4018.00]  We have a ton of topics today.
[4018.08 --> 4018.12]  We do.
[4018.12 --> 4018.74]  So I guess that's good.
[4018.80 --> 4019.48]  Luke, you want to pick one?
[4019.78 --> 4020.72]  Do you want to do the goat one?
[4020.88 --> 4022.02]  Yeah, let's do the goat one.
[4022.20 --> 4022.62]  All right.
[4022.62 --> 4027.46]  CEO of a parent or alleged rug pull game sues Goat.
[4027.54 --> 4033.72]  Goat Moth, a YouTuber that we have featured on WAN Show in the past as he exposed the wiggle,
[4033.94 --> 4035.68]  also known as cheating in Tarkov.
[4036.54 --> 4037.44]  Goat, a YouTuber.
[4037.60 --> 4038.12]  Yep.
[4038.12 --> 4039.50]  Okay, cool.
[4039.62 --> 4041.28]  The opening line is exactly what I just said.
[4041.34 --> 4042.30]  That makes a lot of sense.
[4042.62 --> 4043.10]  Good job.
[4044.52 --> 4050.50]  He is being sued for a more recent video about Terrasynth, a game developer that Goat claims
[4050.50 --> 4056.78]  has used shady behavior to promote its realistic flight and war simulator, Track While Scan.
[4057.58 --> 4059.14]  Just a quick summary of the video.
[4061.00 --> 4067.86]  Terrasynth's teaser trailer, released on D-Day, received backlash last year.
[4068.12 --> 4070.96]  Due to the fact that the gameplay, well, clearly fake.
[4071.86 --> 4073.70]  Sorry, the gameplay is clearly fake.
[4073.92 --> 4078.64]  According to a source who left the project, the gameplay footage is actually just static
[4078.64 --> 4084.26]  models of planes on tracks that just go around these invisible tracks.
[4084.78 --> 4086.64]  Yeah, not great.
[4086.64 --> 4090.02]  The teaser likewise uses footage taken without permission.
[4090.20 --> 4093.62]  This is honestly the part that kind of bothered me a lot.
[4093.62 --> 4099.38]  The teaser likewise uses footage taken without permission of actual soldiers in Afghanistan,
[4099.68 --> 4103.20]  many of whom died two days after the recording was taken.
[4103.50 --> 4104.88]  And that was used in the trailer.
[4104.88 --> 4112.28]  Most of assets used in Terrasynth, allegedly, most of the assets used in Terrasynth's game
[4112.28 --> 4117.16]  roadmap and trailers were stolen or purchased assets that the company tried to pass off
[4117.16 --> 4123.18]  as their own, including, if I remember correctly, a picture of a radar screen just taken from
[4123.18 --> 4125.58]  like Creative Commons off like Wikipedia or something.
[4125.66 --> 4127.28]  They were like, this will be asset for game.
[4127.76 --> 4129.66]  But again, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly.
[4129.66 --> 4135.72]  Uh, CEO Ali Mavan, I hope I'm saying that right, has no prior experience with game development
[4135.72 --> 4141.02]  and is allegedly, CEO Ali Mavan has no prior experience with game development and is alleged
[4141.02 --> 4146.14]  to have exaggerated significant portions of his resume and have seriously misrepresented
[4146.14 --> 4150.06]  the game to potential early adopters whom he was asking for money.
[4150.88 --> 4156.52]  Uh, allegedly, Terrasynth has continued to release trailers, including for a supposed AI traffic
[4156.52 --> 4157.02]  controller.
[4157.52 --> 4162.76]  Mavan has likewise, allegedly, likewise claimed to be bidding for contracts from the U.S.
[4162.92 --> 4163.28]  military.
[4163.44 --> 4164.56]  For what I do not know.
[4165.04 --> 4170.48]  Uh, allegedly, much of this evidence is publicly available, but Goat likewise interviewed insiders
[4170.48 --> 4171.30]  to the project.
[4171.52 --> 4177.38]  Mavan is now suing Goat and his insider, uh, con-tractors for defamation.
[4177.84 --> 4181.86]  Defamation and violating an NDA contract in the state of Ohio.
[4181.86 --> 4188.22]  Neither Mavan nor Goat allegedly live in Ohio, and Mavan doesn't, allegedly, own or operate
[4188.22 --> 4189.10]  any business there.
[4189.38 --> 4197.92]  Ohio lacks anti-slap laws, um, I think it defines this afterwards, which punish, yeah, which punish
[4197.92 --> 4204.00]  frivolous lawsuits intended to silence speech that filter, uh, that the, uh, filer, sorry,
[4204.14 --> 4204.80]  disagrees with.
[4205.10 --> 4208.92]  Goat denies having any NDA with Terrasynth at this time.
[4208.92 --> 4215.06]  Uh, allegedly, oh no, this one's actually, yeah, no, I'm still gonna say allegedly.
[4215.42 --> 4220.38]  Allegedly, Mavan appears to have sent at least three DMCA requests to a Reddit user who posted
[4220.38 --> 4225.34]  screenshots of Terrasynth's Discord in an apparent attempt to get the user's name and personal
[4225.34 --> 4225.88]  information.
[4226.34 --> 4231.78]  Mavan has likewise attempted to do a copyright takedown of Goat's video, which YouTube just
[4231.78 --> 4233.40]  categorically denied.
[4233.40 --> 4239.12]  Um, they didn't even involve Goat, they were just like, nope, that is not legit.
[4239.66 --> 4242.04]  Uh, so yeah, that's going down.
[4242.30 --> 4247.60]  Maybe throw Goat some support, check out the video, um, and we'll have to see how this goes
[4247.60 --> 4248.46]  moving forward.
[4248.68 --> 4254.40]  This is far from the first time we've seen a YouTuber doing some form of investigative
[4254.40 --> 4259.80]  journalism get attacked, uh, and sued by the company that they were doing the investigative
[4259.80 --> 4260.80]  journalism on.
[4261.36 --> 4266.96]  Um, yeah, SLAP stands for Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation.
[4267.08 --> 4271.58]  So it's using lawsuits to crush people from, uh, dissenting.
[4272.04 --> 4275.50]  Um, but yeah, it's currently at 205,000 views.
[4275.60 --> 4279.24]  I watched it, it was quite interesting pretty much the whole way through, and I suggest you
[4279.24 --> 4280.94]  check it out and throw Goat some love.
[4281.48 --> 4282.28]  That's about it.
[4282.28 --> 4285.44]  Next topic.
[4285.58 --> 4286.48]  You shouldn't defraud.
[4287.38 --> 4287.78]  Yeah.
[4287.94 --> 4288.98]  That's my contribution here.
[4289.04 --> 4289.20]  Yeah.
[4289.60 --> 4291.36]  It's, um, we've seen it a bunch.
[4291.54 --> 4297.86]  Unless the one to whom you are performing the defrauding against is in fact a fraudster
[4297.86 --> 4298.50]  themselves.
[4299.66 --> 4300.06]  Okay.
[4300.20 --> 4301.40]  Oh, he's practicing, I like this.
[4301.52 --> 4306.40]  I think, I think, uh, on legal levels that's still a no, but then you just sit in that like,
[4306.48 --> 4307.70]  are you okay with it range.
[4308.32 --> 4308.62]  Mm-hmm.
[4308.90 --> 4309.18]  Yeah.
[4309.58 --> 4310.32]  Cool, sounds good.
[4310.72 --> 4311.12]  Um.
[4311.12 --> 4312.06]  And I helped.
[4312.46 --> 4312.68]  Yeah.
[4313.08 --> 4313.72]  What else do you want to talk about?
[4313.72 --> 4313.98]  Nice.
[4314.22 --> 4316.44]  Maybe that'll be legal in, in Linustown.
[4316.66 --> 4317.14]  It could be.
[4317.24 --> 4317.48]  Um.
[4317.86 --> 4318.26]  Yeah.
[4318.42 --> 4320.40]  Like, if you fraud me, I fraud you right back.
[4320.52 --> 4321.70]  Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
[4321.72 --> 4322.62]  And it's just everything's okay.
[4322.82 --> 4323.78]  It's going to be biblical, baby.
[4323.78 --> 4325.42]  Ha ha ha ha.
[4326.42 --> 4327.76]  Um, the end of Giphy Cat?
[4328.86 --> 4332.90]  Gip hosting service Giphy Cat, which has around 220 million.
[4332.92 --> 4337.38]  I'd like to interject for a moment what you're referring to as Gip is actually Jif.
[4337.38 --> 4341.36]  Gip, or as I like to refer to it, Jif plus a f*** you.
[4343.84 --> 4347.92]  We call it Jiffy Cat just to like butcher it as much as possible.
[4348.44 --> 4351.18]  Um, Snap, parent, I wonder, yeah.
[4351.18 --> 4356.36]  I wonder what the official, like, pronunciation of Jiffy Cat is.
[4358.32 --> 4360.74]  Jiffy Cat sounds very like 1940s.
[4360.74 --> 4361.24]  Cat in a hurry.
[4361.32 --> 4361.72]  I like it.
[4361.72 --> 4362.44]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4362.92 --> 4363.32]  Um.
[4363.84 --> 4369.64]  Snap, the parent company of both Jiffy Cat and Snapchat, has no apparent plan to archive
[4369.64 --> 4373.96]  any of the material, leaving it to users to download whatever content they wish to preserve.
[4374.32 --> 4374.84]  Oh, wow.
[4374.84 --> 4375.80]  Yeah.
[4376.24 --> 4381.78]  Uh, Jiffy Cat, which I'm going to call it from now on, uh, has been running poorly for months
[4381.78 --> 4387.44]  with users experiencing failed uploads, extensive downtime, and complete silence from the service
[4387.44 --> 4387.70]  team.
[4387.84 --> 4393.18]  On May 18th, the site's TLS certificate lapsed, and it was only renewed four days later.
[4393.40 --> 4393.72]  Wow.
[4394.06 --> 4400.04]  Jiffy Cat, Jiffy Cat, I forgot how I was saying it, uh, was among the first web services to
[4400.04 --> 4405.50]  allow video encoding to GIFs, Jiffs, whatever, uh, and it is one of the few free services,
[4405.70 --> 4409.20]  I wonder why, that supports high definition short clips and animation.
[4409.68 --> 4410.26]  Discussion question.
[4410.68 --> 4414.10]  What madness convinces a company to offer high quality video encoding?
[4417.22 --> 4420.00]  What can we possibly do without that kind of madness?
[4420.68 --> 4426.56]  Yeah, so, um, bummer, I guess.
[4427.04 --> 4427.52]  Darn.
[4427.52 --> 4427.56]  Darn.
[4428.14 --> 4429.92]  Yeah, I mean, no, seriously.
[4429.92 --> 4430.48]  It actually sucks.
[4430.64 --> 4431.36]  I like using it.
[4431.38 --> 4432.04]  This does totally suck.
[4432.12 --> 4434.20]  You know, whether we're talking about, what are some of the other?
[4434.20 --> 4434.56]  I actually did.
[4434.60 --> 4438.78]  Imgur, Photobucket, just image hosting sites.
[4439.78 --> 4440.78]  Free to use?
[4440.90 --> 4443.40]  Yeah, we just, we just took them for granted for so long.
[4443.40 --> 4446.56]  And them being free never made any sense.
[4447.30 --> 4447.62]  Ever.
[4447.94 --> 4448.18]  Nope.
[4448.70 --> 4453.80]  What, what possible means could they have to, to recoup their revenue?
[4454.92 --> 4455.36]  Snap.
[4455.48 --> 4456.42]  Starting to charge people.
[4456.56 --> 4457.38]  Snap still exists.
[4457.70 --> 4458.78]  Like, do people use Snapchat?
[4460.38 --> 4460.82]  Huh.
[4461.70 --> 4462.90]  I'm sure someone does.
[4463.32 --> 4463.62]  Hold on.
[4463.70 --> 4468.92]  I think I have their stock ticker in my just like, I'm, I'm curious how tech stocks are
[4468.92 --> 4469.60]  doing list.
[4470.88 --> 4471.96]  Good gravy.
[4471.96 --> 4472.96]  Snapchat monthly active users.
[4472.96 --> 4473.54]  Um.
[4476.26 --> 4479.92]  Snapchat monthly active users.
[4479.92 --> 4487.44]  From a high of a share price of almost $90 back sometime in like late 2021, they are down
[4487.44 --> 4488.78]  to about 10 bucks.
[4489.22 --> 4489.44]  Ah.
[4489.44 --> 4489.48]  Yeah.
[4491.08 --> 4494.50]  And they've been flat lined for basically a year.
[4495.24 --> 4495.62]  Yeah.
[4495.70 --> 4495.90]  Yeah.
[4495.90 --> 4499.04]  When you Google Snapchat monthly active users.
[4499.04 --> 4504.20]  Uh, at least my autofill only autofills for 2022 and 2021.
[4504.90 --> 4505.44]  Yeah.
[4505.44 --> 4507.70]  I was searching for monthly active users in this current year.
[4507.70 --> 4510.46]  People are like, you know, people are still horny.
[4510.46 --> 4511.46]  So Snap exists.
[4511.46 --> 4512.46]  Um.
[4512.46 --> 4513.46]  Yeah.
[4513.46 --> 4514.58]  But can't you, can't you do that with like WhatsApp now?
[4514.96 --> 4515.92]  Send, uh.
[4516.04 --> 4516.38]  I don't know.
[4516.38 --> 4517.78]  Ephemeral pictures.
[4517.92 --> 4518.34]  Here I'll try and see.
[4518.34 --> 4519.86]  Ephemeral pictures are also stupid.
[4519.86 --> 4521.32]  I mean.
[4523.70 --> 4524.14]  Okay.
[4524.68 --> 4526.08]  Well, let's talk about that.
[4526.24 --> 4526.56]  Okay.
[4527.40 --> 4527.84]  Okay.
[4528.02 --> 4528.60]  You, um.
[4528.60 --> 4529.96]  If something shows up on a screen.
[4530.46 --> 4531.58]  Oh, I see what you mean.
[4531.90 --> 4532.16]  Yeah.
[4532.46 --> 4533.20]  Well, yes.
[4533.64 --> 4536.00]  You're like, it's not actually ephemeral.
[4536.00 --> 4537.76]  Like, what's the point?
[4538.32 --> 4539.88]  I've never, never understood.
[4540.42 --> 4540.74]  Okay.
[4540.82 --> 4541.28]  That's fair.
[4541.38 --> 4542.86]  Because I have literally talked.
[4542.96 --> 4547.20]  I actually think it's almost a negative, if anything, because it gives you this false
[4547.20 --> 4551.50]  confidence, if you're not very technical, it gives you this false confidence that it's
[4551.50 --> 4552.02]  going to go away.
[4552.26 --> 4554.86]  Especially when they add that feature that's like, oh, they took a screenshot.
[4555.08 --> 4557.12]  Cause that's the only way to capture a screen.
[4557.12 --> 4557.42]  Right?
[4557.68 --> 4560.18]  So now you're like, I will know if they did it.
[4560.36 --> 4561.52]  It's like, well, that's not true.
[4563.00 --> 4565.50]  Like, it's just not true.
[4565.80 --> 4566.20]  Yeah.
[4566.60 --> 4567.58]  False sense of security.
[4567.78 --> 4569.58]  It's a stupid feature.
[4573.76 --> 4574.34]  That's it.
[4574.50 --> 4575.02]  I don't know.
[4575.08 --> 4577.00]  I just, I am very much not a fan.
[4577.00 --> 4578.24]  I've always thought it was dumb.
[4580.84 --> 4581.20]  Yeah.
[4581.34 --> 4581.78]  That's it.
[4582.56 --> 4583.08]  All right.
[4583.12 --> 4583.50]  Fine.
[4584.30 --> 4585.50]  See you later, Jiffy Cat.
[4586.16 --> 4586.52]  Bye.
[4586.94 --> 4587.94]  It does actually suck.
[4588.06 --> 4589.20]  I actually did like using it.
[4589.20 --> 4590.50]  I like sending gifts.
[4590.86 --> 4595.32]  This is one that we're probably going to have a bit of a longer conversation about.
[4596.00 --> 4601.08]  A new French law allows police to spy using consumer devices.
[4601.98 --> 4602.66]  That's right.
[4602.76 --> 4605.60]  This is, this is actually happening.
[4605.60 --> 4609.24]  This is not in like Iran or something.
[4609.24 --> 4611.26]  Like this is in, this is in Europe.
[4611.52 --> 4611.82]  Okay.
[4612.32 --> 4617.12]  French lawmakers have agreed to a bill that allows police to spy on suspects.
[4617.12 --> 4620.02]  Remember the word suspects is important here.
[4620.02 --> 4622.30]  They are suspected of something.
[4622.30 --> 4625.64]  They have not actually been tried.
[4626.40 --> 4629.02]  They're, they're not, they're not guilty yet.
[4630.58 --> 4638.54]  Allows police to spy on suspects through remotely activating the camera, microphone, and a GPS of
[4638.54 --> 4641.70]  their phones and other devices, including laptops, cars, and phones.
[4641.90 --> 4642.66]  Holy shit.
[4644.36 --> 4644.90]  Um.
[4644.90 --> 4648.82]  But it's okay.
[4648.82 --> 4655.16]  They say, they say, because this only applies to offenses punishable by at least five years
[4655.16 --> 4655.84]  in jail.
[4656.80 --> 4663.74]  Use of the provision must be approved by a judge and the surveillance cannot exceed six months.
[4663.74 --> 4676.76]  The provision cannot be used against sensitive professions such as, how convenient is this, doctors, journalists, lawyers, judges, and members of parliament.
[4677.76 --> 4679.92]  Oh, well that covers all the bases.
[4679.92 --> 4685.64]  We're definitely not worried about like billions of dollars worth of IP being able to be accessed
[4685.64 --> 4687.88]  by anyone that does this.
[4688.56 --> 4694.10]  Uh, the French justice minister has said that it would affect at most dozens of cases a year.
[4694.28 --> 4697.92]  The new law has been widely criticized as authoritarian.
[4698.26 --> 4698.82]  Cause it is.
[4698.96 --> 4699.10]  Yeah.
[4699.48 --> 4701.12]  Holy crap.
[4701.60 --> 4701.86]  Yeah.
[4702.68 --> 4705.02]  Absolutely mind blowing.
[4705.02 --> 4715.74]  So if you are suspected of a crime that would be punishable by five years in prison, but you happen to be a member of parliament or a lawyer,
[4716.14 --> 4719.12]  then they can't surveil you.
[4719.24 --> 4720.52]  Someone in chat said, so a warrant.
[4720.68 --> 4721.26]  So it's a warrant.
[4721.38 --> 4722.28]  I don't think that's the same.
[4722.88 --> 4724.12]  Cause you have to be served with a warrant.
[4724.22 --> 4724.48]  Don't you?
[4725.60 --> 4726.82]  No, I have no idea.
[4726.96 --> 4728.68]  No, you never, never been warrant searched.
[4731.88 --> 4732.24]  Hmm.
[4732.24 --> 4738.48]  But the fact that they can execute this remotely and like, okay.
[4738.76 --> 4739.30]  You won't know.
[4739.32 --> 4742.30]  The bigger issue is what happens to this data who has access to it.
[4742.82 --> 4743.18]  Right.
[4743.52 --> 4744.52]  It's going to leak at some point.
[4744.64 --> 4745.10]  Yeah, of course.
[4745.24 --> 4746.18]  Everything leaks at some point.
[4746.20 --> 4746.66]  Of course it will.
[4746.74 --> 4748.36]  Or, I mean, nevermind leak.
[4748.46 --> 4752.16]  Like what is to prevent someone from using these mechanisms?
[4752.40 --> 4752.56]  Oh yeah.
[4752.64 --> 4753.24]  If they exist.
[4753.24 --> 4759.24]  A couple of weeks ago, we talked about how Amazon shut down that guy's, um, like devices
[4759.24 --> 4763.02]  because of an alleged incident with a delivery driver or something like that.
[4763.06 --> 4770.08]  And I'm sitting here going, the fact that an Amazon employee can even do that is, is mind
[4770.08 --> 4770.36]  blowing.
[4770.46 --> 4771.60]  It shouldn't even be possible.
[4771.96 --> 4777.40]  And here we're sitting here going, yeah, we're just going to remotely activate your camera,
[4777.48 --> 4784.90]  microphone, GPS of like, we are, we are actually headed into a dystopian future, sir.
[4784.90 --> 4785.18]  Yeah.
[4785.18 --> 4792.66]  You mentioned the car, um, smart cars have always been a little weird for that.
[4792.96 --> 4793.48]  I don't know.
[4793.74 --> 4800.84]  Like there's something to be said about having a car that is just a car, you know?
[4804.84 --> 4811.28]  Dark24 asks, how is this any different than me surveilling all of the employees in Linustown?
[4811.28 --> 4816.28]  Well, the difference is that they're all going to know that I'm sitting around with my pants
[4816.28 --> 4821.70]  off, enjoying, you know, the voyeurism of watching their daily lives.
[4822.08 --> 4823.70]  These people don't know.
[4826.34 --> 4827.24]  Consenting adults.
[4827.88 --> 4828.32]  Exactly.
[4828.78 --> 4828.98]  Yeah.
[4831.08 --> 4831.64]  Obviously.
[4834.16 --> 4838.22]  I feel like just in case someone didn't get it, that was a joke.
[4838.22 --> 4843.92]  We are joking about something that was previously brought up on WAN Show, which was talking about
[4843.92 --> 4844.60]  Linustown.
[4845.04 --> 4846.24]  None of that was serious.
[4846.38 --> 4849.76]  Just before we get some message from someone who super did not get it.
[4849.88 --> 4852.90]  Who actually doesn't understand that I do not think that that's okay.
[4854.90 --> 4861.38]  We don't have any net nanny on people's work computers or like, you know, screen monitoring
[4861.38 --> 4862.30]  or anything like that.
[4862.30 --> 4868.76]  We are implementing stuff that will show like remote management tools.
[4869.84 --> 4873.96]  And you like shouldn't do personal stuff on your work computer and things like that.
[4876.28 --> 4877.18]  So there's that.
[4877.38 --> 4878.64]  Oh, what are we monitoring for?
[4878.68 --> 4879.84]  I actually don't know about any of this.
[4879.88 --> 4880.86]  So I guess I'm getting my briefing.
[4881.08 --> 4882.66]  It's mostly management.
[4882.66 --> 4887.76]  So like we can make sure that people are getting certain updates to browsers, updates to windows,
[4888.10 --> 4888.82]  things like that.
[4888.90 --> 4894.30]  If a security breach is detected, we can remote air.
[4894.30 --> 4897.48]  I hate this term so much, but we can remote.
[4897.54 --> 4898.92]  I've ranted to him before.
[4899.02 --> 4899.54]  That's why he left.
[4899.94 --> 4905.42]  We can remote air gap computers, which is not air gapping them literally at all.
[4905.74 --> 4907.42]  I hate that term, but whatever.
[4908.30 --> 4908.78]  Hey.
[4908.78 --> 4912.16]  We can also request remote into people's computers using this.
[4913.92 --> 4918.30]  I think there will be a certain tier where we can remote in without requesting.
[4918.68 --> 4923.14]  But if I remember correctly, the goal for that is computers that are not individuals machines.
[4923.32 --> 4923.72]  Okay.
[4924.24 --> 4930.42]  Where it's like, oh, this is like the stream deck PC or the, sorry, the stream cart PC or something
[4930.42 --> 4931.58]  like that type of stuff.
[4931.62 --> 4937.58]  If it's an individual's workstation, it won't be a non-request, whatever, blah, blah, blah,
[4937.58 --> 4937.84]  blah, blah.
[4937.84 --> 4939.88]  There's a bunch of, we went through it with Yvonne.
[4940.80 --> 4941.06]  Okay.
[4941.28 --> 4941.58]  All right.
[4941.60 --> 4941.72]  Yeah.
[4941.72 --> 4942.40]  That all sounds fine.
[4942.96 --> 4943.68]  Question for you.
[4943.80 --> 4944.02]  You guys using Ninja.
[4944.20 --> 4944.50]  Yes.
[4945.72 --> 4946.08]  There you go.
[4946.28 --> 4947.04]  Question for you.
[4947.86 --> 4955.78]  Would you have any interest in a network switch that can be remotely configured to completely
[4955.78 --> 4957.88]  like physically disconnect a port?
[4958.74 --> 4959.00]  Yeah.
[4959.70 --> 4960.10]  Okay.
[4960.10 --> 4961.24]  Because they reached out.
[4961.34 --> 4963.28]  They like wanted to work together or something like that.
[4963.62 --> 4963.74]  Oh.
[4963.74 --> 4967.66]  So like, is that, what kind of machines would that be useful for?
[4967.74 --> 4970.48]  Because I don't think we'd be able to use them for everything because they're not 10
[4970.48 --> 4971.04]  gig or whatever.
[4971.22 --> 4973.16]  Like they wouldn't be for performance applications.
[4974.02 --> 4979.54]  But that's their whole shtick is that you actually physically disable the port.
[4979.54 --> 4984.84]  But then the question I had was if you can remotely disable the port.
[4984.92 --> 4985.70]  Can you remotely enable it?
[4985.70 --> 4987.02]  Can you remotely re-enable it?
[4987.10 --> 4988.46]  And then, and then is it really air gapped?
[4988.88 --> 4990.14]  I mean, it's probably better than.
[4990.42 --> 4993.58]  If you can remotely enable it, I just, it's, it's just irrelevant in my opinion.
[4993.84 --> 4994.12]  Okay.
[4994.12 --> 4998.02]  So you, and then if you can't, then it's, then it's irrelevant because you might as well
[4998.02 --> 4999.08]  just go back there and unplug it.
[4999.82 --> 5001.84]  Like if you have to have physical access to it.
[5002.02 --> 5003.22]  Well, no, not really.
[5003.34 --> 5003.66]  No.
[5003.84 --> 5004.64]  I'll send it to you.
[5004.80 --> 5005.00]  Yeah.
[5005.10 --> 5005.72]  It could be interesting.
[5005.84 --> 5005.98]  Yeah.
[5006.24 --> 5007.94]  I'll, I'll send, I'll send it to you.
[5008.00 --> 5011.24]  Um, people are probably, people are probably curious.
[5011.36 --> 5015.46]  I'm just going to, if I don't find it immediately searching for air gap.
[5015.60 --> 5016.22]  Oh, here it is.
[5016.92 --> 5021.78]  Um, OSI layer one network kill switch slash air gap system.
[5021.78 --> 5028.86]  Um, we're a small cyber hardware startup based in the UK, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5029.20 --> 5034.20]  So it's the literal equivalent of having someone at your rack physically pulling or unplugging
[5034.20 --> 5034.94]  your LAN cable.
[5035.24 --> 5036.94]  So how, how, how, how so how does it work?
[5037.12 --> 5041.24]  They have remote triggers in development such as, uh, Laura, when and Zigbee.
[5041.38 --> 5046.14]  So it would be separate from your LAN network.
[5046.98 --> 5048.48]  That's actually more interesting.
[5048.48 --> 5054.50]  If someone, if someone had, was like, if someone had managed to get into your Zigbee controller
[5054.50 --> 5060.38]  and also coordinated a cyber attack on a computer that they wanted to make sure you can have
[5060.38 --> 5060.94]  a lot going on.
[5061.04 --> 5061.12]  Yeah.
[5061.16 --> 5062.50]  It's, it's, it's another factor.
[5062.74 --> 5066.44]  You know, nothing is bulletproof, but what you can do is you can add factors.
[5066.44 --> 5068.24]  So it's another security factor.
[5068.98 --> 5070.24]  Um, yeah.
[5070.36 --> 5072.16]  So that's, that's kind of, that's kind of cool.
[5073.72 --> 5075.06]  Anyway, it looks like that.
[5075.56 --> 5076.54]  It's a network switch.
[5076.56 --> 5076.88]  All right.
[5076.88 --> 5078.88]  That's a network switch.
[5079.04 --> 5079.24]  Yep.
[5079.36 --> 5080.06]  Can confirm.
[5080.76 --> 5081.44]  So, yeah.
[5081.50 --> 5081.72]  Okay.
[5081.80 --> 5082.30]  But sorry.
[5082.56 --> 5083.52]  How does it do it?
[5088.52 --> 5093.40]  Because that, that, that just sounded like fake air gapping again.
[5094.10 --> 5095.18]  I, I didn't read it.
[5095.24 --> 5095.84]  I haven't looked at it.
[5095.88 --> 5096.30]  I don't know.
[5096.72 --> 5097.38]  I'll forward it to you.
[5097.44 --> 5097.66]  Okay.
[5098.20 --> 5098.80]  We'll figure it out.
[5098.80 --> 5104.12]  I just don't think things should be called air gap.
[5104.22 --> 5107.64]  If there is no gap of air.
[5111.92 --> 5114.28]  Technically, there's probably a very small gap of air.
[5114.40 --> 5115.52]  Oh my goodness.
[5115.52 --> 5122.78]  Technically, we're just a long tube.
[5123.74 --> 5127.18]  I really thought we were going to talk about that French law a lot more than we ended up doing,
[5127.30 --> 5127.74]  but I guess.
[5127.96 --> 5128.86]  I don't think there's a lot to say.
[5128.92 --> 5129.54]  It's just kind of.
[5129.60 --> 5130.74]  Other than very bad.
[5130.98 --> 5131.30]  Reprehensible.
[5131.68 --> 5135.30]  It's, you, you can never imagine when you make something like this, that the tools are
[5135.30 --> 5138.62]  not going to end up in the hands of someone that you don't want them to be.
[5138.62 --> 5143.26]  And anytime there's a back door, that means there is a possible door for someone else
[5143.26 --> 5143.66]  to find.
[5145.10 --> 5149.74]  And anytime you make a law like this, you should assume that someone will use it on you someday
[5149.74 --> 5151.20]  and then you should not do that.
[5151.56 --> 5151.68]  Yep.
[5153.40 --> 5161.54]  Like I'm not, I'm not, I'm not pro, you know, I'm not pro people, not, I'm not pro people
[5161.54 --> 5163.34]  getting away with breaking the law.
[5163.58 --> 5168.02]  You know, like I'm, I'm, I'm sure ne'er do well has had similar objections to street lamps.
[5168.62 --> 5172.60]  When they implemented them in the like 1800s or, you know, whenever, whenever street lamps
[5172.60 --> 5179.00]  showed up, apparently the, the reduction in just sort of general street crime was like
[5179.00 --> 5180.96]  enormous just from lights.
[5181.70 --> 5188.02]  Uh, let me see if I can, let me see if I can find the, uh, oh wait, hold on.
[5188.20 --> 5191.80]  No, little rigorous evidence exists to support this contention.
[5193.06 --> 5193.82]  Hold on.
[5194.76 --> 5196.30]  Man, now I, now I can't find it.
[5196.30 --> 5204.00]  Um, in the UK, an average of 38 fewer crimes were observed in areas with improved street
[5204.00 --> 5205.28]  lighting based on five studies.
[5205.96 --> 5210.06]  Um, man, now I was reading a thing a long time ago, so I'm not going to be able to find
[5210.06 --> 5210.32]  it again.
[5210.36 --> 5214.10]  I don't think, but it was something to do with like when street lighting was first implemented,
[5214.10 --> 5216.94]  it had like an enormous impact or something like that.
[5216.94 --> 5220.90]  But, uh, apparently I just am completely off base on all of this.
[5220.94 --> 5221.66]  So there you go.
[5222.98 --> 5223.34]  Sweet.
[5224.24 --> 5225.16]  Um, yeah.
[5225.76 --> 5226.16]  Chat.
[5226.72 --> 5227.44]  Street lamps.
[5227.56 --> 5231.06]  Basically the same thing as pointing cameras at everyone in their own house.
[5231.34 --> 5233.60]  No, no, it's, it's not the same thing.
[5233.64 --> 5238.92]  I'm just saying like, we're on, I feel like we're on this slippery slope right now where
[5238.92 --> 5242.98]  we're just kind of like, yeah, what's another camera?
[5243.38 --> 5244.46]  What's another microphone?
[5244.80 --> 5249.82]  And at a certain point, it's like, no, actually it, that that's actually bad.
[5250.56 --> 5251.68]  Um, yeah.
[5251.94 --> 5256.14]  Um, like there's a, there's an old picture of, uh, Zuckerberg sitting at his laptop and
[5256.14 --> 5257.28]  his cameras taped over.
[5257.28 --> 5263.22]  And you'd think like this, this person should have substantial security, right?
[5263.34 --> 5264.64]  So it shouldn't be a problem.
[5264.78 --> 5266.04]  So why does he care?
[5266.34 --> 5270.68]  Maybe because it like is a problem anyways, you are never fully secured out.
[5270.68 --> 5271.02]  Right.
[5271.42 --> 5275.64]  And like the fact that these things have cameras on both ends of them.
[5275.98 --> 5278.06]  I never use the selfie cam.
[5278.98 --> 5279.90]  Literally ever.
[5280.80 --> 5285.06]  I don't know if the selfie cam on this phone has actually like ever been used.
[5285.06 --> 5286.26]  I just flip it around.
[5287.28 --> 5288.60]  And take the picture that way.
[5288.86 --> 5290.70]  So like, cause it's a better camera.
[5290.84 --> 5291.14]  No scope.
[5291.62 --> 5291.84]  Yeah.
[5291.88 --> 5292.40]  Like whatever.
[5292.64 --> 5293.22]  I don't know.
[5293.44 --> 5294.02]  I don't care.
[5294.56 --> 5296.22]  I'm not taking pictures of myself that often.
[5296.46 --> 5301.48]  So like, I've thought about just covering it up before, but then I'm like, well, there's
[5301.48 --> 5306.46]  still the camera on the other side and microphones and everything else and all the other cameras
[5306.46 --> 5308.06]  and all the other everythings.
[5308.24 --> 5309.70]  It's like, I don't know.
[5311.56 --> 5312.50]  Never a video call.
[5312.58 --> 5313.12]  Not off my phone.
[5313.24 --> 5314.48]  No, no, never.
[5314.48 --> 5319.46]  I don't generally like being on my phone.
[5320.60 --> 5322.72]  I especially don't really like video calls.
[5323.06 --> 5323.30]  Yeah.
[5323.42 --> 5324.82]  Actually kind of, I kind of hate them.
[5324.88 --> 5326.78]  Like if I want to pick my nose or something, then.
[5327.78 --> 5328.04]  Yeah.
[5328.66 --> 5333.62]  Speaking of which, I saw some speculation that I'm a coke head because I like.
[5334.64 --> 5335.00]  Oh.
[5335.52 --> 5337.40]  No, I just have a lot of nose hair.
[5337.54 --> 5337.78]  Yeah.
[5338.00 --> 5338.40]  Me too.
[5338.44 --> 5342.72]  And it grows into the, it grows from the one side and then it kind of like tickles the
[5342.72 --> 5343.18]  other side.
[5343.32 --> 5343.50]  It's like.
[5343.50 --> 5344.84]  You have to scratch it all the time.
[5344.94 --> 5345.06]  Yeah.
[5345.82 --> 5351.26]  That's, that's the, the less interesting, but far more based in reality explanation for
[5351.26 --> 5351.88]  that, by the way.
[5351.94 --> 5352.64]  We're aging.
[5353.64 --> 5354.08]  Yeah.
[5354.08 --> 5357.06]  It's pretty awesome.
[5359.28 --> 5360.16]  Oh man.
[5360.98 --> 5362.18]  Time to talk sponsors.
[5362.66 --> 5366.24]  So someone in chat, why take a picture of yourself and you take a picture of a burrito?
[5367.50 --> 5367.94]  Exactly.
[5371.24 --> 5376.20]  I guarantee you there's more pictures of like food in my phone than pictures of myself.
[5376.88 --> 5377.62]  Oh man.
[5377.62 --> 5378.18]  You take food pictures?
[5379.10 --> 5379.68]  Yeah, sometimes.
[5380.76 --> 5382.06]  What do I take pictures of?
[5383.68 --> 5383.82]  Oh.
[5384.08 --> 5385.96]  Here, why don't we play categorize the picture?
[5386.48 --> 5386.92]  Oh God.
[5387.08 --> 5389.86]  We can't look at the pictures on my phone though, but I'll tell you what they are.
[5389.86 --> 5390.30]  Oh my God.
[5391.40 --> 5393.42]  I don't even, I don't need to know that.
[5394.82 --> 5395.22]  Okay.
[5395.64 --> 5396.26]  My family.
[5397.24 --> 5398.36]  My family again.
[5398.78 --> 5399.22]  Float plane.
[5400.08 --> 5401.40]  My kids petting a goat.
[5401.60 --> 5402.14]  Merch messages.
[5402.84 --> 5403.46]  My cat.
[5404.06 --> 5404.50]  Waits.
[5406.78 --> 5408.74]  Me and Yvonne in the badminton building.
[5410.10 --> 5414.06]  A picture that I needed to figure out some networking stuff at my, my partner's parents'
[5414.08 --> 5414.50]  place.
[5414.74 --> 5416.20]  Yvonne in bed, but it's safe for work.
[5417.30 --> 5420.68]  A bottle of mayonnaise that I wanted to see if my parents were cool with because I needed
[5420.68 --> 5421.94]  to bring mayonnaise over to their place.
[5422.32 --> 5424.84]  And it was like weird because it was Japanese or something.
[5424.96 --> 5426.88]  Picture of a kid at a dance recital.
[5427.28 --> 5429.62]  A book that I want to buy for someone for Christmas.
[5430.54 --> 5433.04]  A shot of the green screen upstairs.
[5433.46 --> 5434.98]  I don't know why I needed that.
[5435.68 --> 5436.78]  My, my notes.
[5436.98 --> 5440.60]  Cause I take paper notes when I'm working out cause I'm weird and old, but I wanted to
[5440.60 --> 5441.50]  send a picture of it to someone.
[5441.60 --> 5442.28]  So my notes.
[5442.38 --> 5446.34]  The scoreboard after I absolutely annihilated Yvonne at bubble hockey.
[5446.56 --> 5447.54]  Oh, that was kind of brutal.
[5447.92 --> 5448.78]  14 to one.
[5449.02 --> 5449.20]  Yeah.
[5449.26 --> 5450.94]  It's no wonder she doesn't want to play games with me.
[5452.86 --> 5453.54]  My bird.
[5453.54 --> 5456.62]  A paint deficiency to send to the painters.
[5458.52 --> 5459.52]  We're pretty boring.
[5459.88 --> 5460.06]  Yeah.
[5460.18 --> 5460.54]  Actually.
[5460.90 --> 5461.64]  That's why you were aging.
[5463.96 --> 5465.02]  Oh, okay.
[5465.54 --> 5467.74]  This was with the other camera though, but my mustache.
[5468.80 --> 5472.78]  So there is actually a selfie, but I only took the selfie cause I thought it was, I looked
[5472.78 --> 5473.16]  stupid.
[5473.38 --> 5474.94]  Not because I was trying to look good.
[5475.20 --> 5476.64]  And you didn't even bother to wipe your lens.
[5476.74 --> 5477.40]  That looked awful.
[5477.58 --> 5477.80]  Yeah.
[5478.22 --> 5479.06]  Cause I didn't care.
[5480.82 --> 5481.26]  Terrible.
[5481.26 --> 5484.98]  Oh man.
[5485.66 --> 5486.66]  Why just takes pictures?
[5486.80 --> 5488.04]  Luke just screenshots life.
[5488.18 --> 5494.92]  That is honestly, that is mostly what the cameras for is, is effectively that.
[5496.72 --> 5498.98]  You don't have to save that stuff to your camera roll though.
[5500.10 --> 5501.72]  If you take, if, well, okay.
[5501.76 --> 5502.12]  I don't know.
[5502.18 --> 5504.46]  I primarily use WhatsApp for personal communication.
[5504.48 --> 5510.00]  So if you just use the camera icon in the app, it doesn't go to your gallery.
[5510.00 --> 5512.56]  It just sends it to the person and then you never see it again.
[5512.68 --> 5518.86]  I think I have every single messaging app a person could possibly have because everyone
[5518.86 --> 5520.26]  wants to use something different.
[5520.60 --> 5523.38]  So I don't necessarily know which person I'm sending it to.
[5523.54 --> 5527.38]  And I know the, that version of that camera thing, at least the last time I used it, which
[5527.38 --> 5527.90]  has been a while.
[5527.96 --> 5528.54]  So maybe it's better.
[5528.54 --> 5533.20]  But the one in discord, which is my most commonly used messaging app is trash.
[5533.28 --> 5534.46]  It doesn't show you the whole camera.
[5534.46 --> 5539.08]  So when you take the picture, there's extra stuff that it sends when you send the picture
[5539.08 --> 5542.96]  that you weren't able to see when you were taking the picture, which is like the worst
[5542.96 --> 5543.62]  thing ever.
[5545.08 --> 5551.16]  If you want bird pictures, I don't, I don't, I don't know how to, I can't do this well.
[5552.28 --> 5556.92]  Uh, oh my.
[5557.10 --> 5557.98]  Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
[5558.10 --> 5559.52]  I just sent you a picture.
[5559.70 --> 5561.24]  Oh, I mean, I told you it's been a long time.
[5561.30 --> 5562.14]  It might be different now.
[5562.14 --> 5563.30]  Yeah, it doesn't go to your camera roll.
[5564.10 --> 5564.36]  Hmm.
[5564.46 --> 5566.00]  It does save it locally though.
[5566.26 --> 5567.74]  So it probably just saves it in another folder.
[5567.90 --> 5569.70]  And then I don't bother backing up those folders.
[5570.06 --> 5573.98]  I only back up my like gallery folder, like my cam call.
[5574.14 --> 5580.42]  I call it camera roll because fun fact, my first smartphone that wasn't a Blackberry was
[5580.42 --> 5580.80]  an iPhone.
[5581.06 --> 5584.02]  Uh, so I have some like old iPhone user habits.
[5585.14 --> 5585.54]  Hmm.
[5586.12 --> 5586.72]  All right.
[5587.08 --> 5587.88]  Well, there you go.
[5589.38 --> 5589.98]  Oh, right.

[5716.36 --> 5717.32]  What do you think?
[5718.30 --> 5721.28]  Anti-telemarketing bot gets upgraded with AI?
[5721.54 --> 5723.12]  Because this kind of sounds awesome.
[5723.84 --> 5727.98]  Anti-telemarketer service Jolly Roger has upgraded its...
[5727.98 --> 5728.32]  Oh, wait.
[5728.48 --> 5730.42]  We're supposed to do three merch messages.
[5730.56 --> 5730.92]  Okay, Dan.
[5731.00 --> 5731.48]  Sorry, you hit me.
[5731.58 --> 5732.22]  You could...
[5732.22 --> 5733.24]  Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[5733.28 --> 5735.64]  You're allowed to be in charge if you want to go with your own flow.
[5735.64 --> 5736.52]  I don't want to be anymore.
[5736.60 --> 5737.86]  That's why I hire people to be my boss.
[5738.02 --> 5739.28]  Okay, then pay attention.
[5740.12 --> 5740.74]  Hey, DLD.
[5740.98 --> 5743.18]  First Mertz message to The Dan Show.
[5743.58 --> 5747.98]  I was just wondering how you built a startup from the ground up.
[5748.34 --> 5753.46]  How did you avoid burning out during your growing period when you had that dragon energy?
[5754.80 --> 5756.10]  Oh, what a good question.
[5756.28 --> 5757.06]  How I built a startup?
[5757.06 --> 5757.84]  If you never slow down, you can't stop.
[5757.84 --> 5759.00]  I mean, I got a little lucky.
[5759.20 --> 5760.24]  I had a great team.
[5760.56 --> 5761.74]  I worked really hard.
[5762.22 --> 5766.58]  And as for how I kept the energy, well, I was always in debt.
[5767.06 --> 5772.66]  So if I didn't keep going hard, then I would never pay off my debt.
[5772.78 --> 5775.80]  And I would have to be bankrupt and lose my house.
[5775.92 --> 5777.48]  And my family would be on the street.
[5777.48 --> 5782.56]  So if that's not a strong enough motivation, I don't know what is.
[5783.08 --> 5785.94]  That's how to do it.
[5787.26 --> 5789.12]  Also, there were other ideas.
[5789.44 --> 5793.70]  In a potentially negative way, you've kind of used that against yourself before.
[5794.42 --> 5795.78]  Like, I'm not feeling energized.
[5796.74 --> 5798.56]  Let's get myself in some more debt.
[5798.56 --> 5801.22]  I don't want to talk about that.
[5801.22 --> 5801.28]  I've seen it.
[5801.52 --> 5801.80]  Yeah.
[5802.76 --> 5803.06]  Yeah.
[5804.22 --> 5806.04]  Let's go double down.
[5806.42 --> 5806.74]  Yeah.
[5809.24 --> 5810.00]  I don't know.
[5810.32 --> 5811.44]  Yeah, I don't know how great that is.
[5811.44 --> 5812.30]  Yeah, a ton of stress.
[5812.40 --> 5814.72]  I'm probably going to die much younger than I would have otherwise.
[5815.92 --> 5816.16]  Yeah.
[5816.28 --> 5816.62]  All right.
[5816.90 --> 5820.14]  We're kind of like competing on which one of us is going to expire first.
[5820.20 --> 5825.30]  Yeah, like I'm older than him, but I'm pretty sure he's actually going to beat me.
[5825.54 --> 5825.76]  Yep.
[5826.04 --> 5826.94]  He's bigger than me.
[5827.16 --> 5828.18]  That's a good thing, too.
[5828.18 --> 5829.44]  That's actually a thing.
[5829.64 --> 5829.76]  Yeah.
[5830.00 --> 5830.22]  Yeah.
[5830.22 --> 5832.20]  Tall people are all like, yeah, I'm tall.
[5832.30 --> 5832.94]  You know, what's up?
[5832.96 --> 5834.54]  And I'm all like, yeah, I'm short.
[5834.82 --> 5837.90]  And how many, like, tall 95-year-olds do you know?
[5839.36 --> 5839.80]  Boom.
[5839.90 --> 5840.38]  Got him.
[5841.38 --> 5841.86]  Boom.
[5841.92 --> 5842.28]  Roasted.
[5843.86 --> 5844.56]  Hi, DL.
[5844.80 --> 5848.56]  How do you think Matter will change the home automation environment?
[5848.82 --> 5854.14]  Will we actually get better compatibility and interoperability between devices and systems?
[5854.44 --> 5855.70]  I hope so.
[5855.70 --> 5862.74]  But honestly, it's the whole XKCD standards proliferate comic strip all over again, right?
[5862.74 --> 5868.00]  Theoretically, matter has enough momentum behind it that it's going to basically allow for consolidation.
[5868.38 --> 5871.02]  So everything will just kind of be interoperable.
[5871.02 --> 5890.90]  In practice, you know, even some of the more open and interoperable standards in the past have struggled with either, you know, compliance from the companies that are building hardware for them, or they've, you know, struggled with a lackluster ecosystem because of all the certification involved.
[5890.90 --> 5891.92]  Like, there's always challenges.
[5891.92 --> 5893.08]  There's no perfect solution.
[5893.86 --> 5895.12]  I hope Matter wins.
[5896.74 --> 5899.64]  I give up, though.
[5899.76 --> 5913.34]  Like, at this point, I accept that there's going to be a ton of disparate ecosystems, and I'm going to have to rely on Home Assistant or similar to just try to tie them all together somehow.
[5913.34 --> 5943.32]  Okay, and last one.
[5943.32 --> 5958.28]  I think it's interesting, you know, when maybe we have other verticals that we also cover that TechLink kind of touches on once in a while, and we break those out into their own thing, and then all of a sudden, there's like nothing left for TechLinked anymore.
[5958.28 --> 5961.56]  I mean, it's happened to a degree to LTT.
[5961.76 --> 5968.50]  Do you know how much harder it is to come up with an idea for an LTT now that TechQuickie and ShortCircuit and TechLinked exist?
[5969.66 --> 5969.90]  Yeah.
[5970.68 --> 5975.02]  Like, people even complain when we do something that's too similar to what should be on those other channels.
[5975.10 --> 5976.34]  This just felt like a short circuit.
[5976.50 --> 5979.12]  It's like, well, it would have been an LTT like six months ago.
[5979.20 --> 5979.50]  Yeah.
[5979.78 --> 5980.02]  Yeah.
[5980.28 --> 5980.68]  Sorry.
[5981.28 --> 5981.56]  Yeah.
[5984.04 --> 5985.08]  Yeah, I don't know.
[5985.28 --> 5988.62]  I think there's also a way that you can approach the topic.
[5989.62 --> 5998.02]  Like, I feel like there could be a TechLinked approach to a certain topic that goes into both categories and a game-linked approach to that topic.
[5998.22 --> 6001.16]  Like, the gamers' view on it versus the techies' view on it.
[6001.30 --> 6008.62]  I mean, that was kind of the idea with a channel like Mac Address is that there would be kind of the PC guy perspective over an LTT, and there'd be like the Mac perspective.
[6008.62 --> 6017.40]  But I feel like people will often see us upload a video covering the same topic on two channels and go like, why'd you guys do this?
[6017.44 --> 6020.42]  And the reality of it is it's like a different editorial team.
[6020.62 --> 6027.20]  I think that's less of an issue with LTT because it'll be part of a video that has like 10, 15 other things in it.
[6028.44 --> 6029.10]  I don't know.
[6029.18 --> 6030.72]  I don't think it's going to be that big of a problem.
[6031.20 --> 6035.14]  I think the writers over at LTT will take care of it.
[6036.04 --> 6036.86]  I think it'll be fine.
[6037.74 --> 6038.40]  Go team.
[6039.56 --> 6039.92]  All right.
[6040.02 --> 6040.52]  One more, Dan.
[6041.10 --> 6041.52]  One more.
[6042.30 --> 6042.50]  Sure.
[6043.94 --> 6044.84]  Hi, Linus and Co.
[6044.84 --> 6050.68]  Your philosophy on only making things you feel can improve on is inspiring.
[6051.26 --> 6057.36]  Is there any product that you can identify that needs improvement that you wouldn't want to tackle?
[6060.86 --> 6061.54]  Gaming.
[6062.56 --> 6063.24]  Games.
[6064.46 --> 6067.52]  I actually had a game developer reach out to me today.
[6067.52 --> 6071.74]  Sort of asking if we want a partner to make a game.
[6071.90 --> 6072.60]  It's very hard.
[6072.60 --> 6084.24]  And, you know, I'm basically sitting here going like, you know, here's pretty much the thought process that I went through.
[6084.32 --> 6097.08]  Because if you go back to WAN Show five years ago or something like that, five, six years ago, Luke and I would talk sometimes about, you know, ideas for games or, you know, the desire to make a game or something like that.
[6097.08 --> 6101.74]  Like, I feel like anyone who plays games probably thinks it at some point.
[6101.88 --> 6104.66]  Like, man, how cool would it be if it was like this but not quite like that?
[6104.72 --> 6110.16]  Oh, man, I should just, I should, it would be so cool to do my own game and I'd do it exactly the way that I think it should be done.
[6110.16 --> 6118.22]  But the reality of it is that the genres of games that I'm most interested in are just not profitable.
[6118.54 --> 6121.18]  Like, you know, I looked at something like YouTuber Simulator, right?
[6121.24 --> 6124.38]  That PewDiePie partnership with some, like, gacha game company.
[6124.50 --> 6125.52]  I don't know who made it.
[6125.72 --> 6125.82]  Yeah.
[6125.94 --> 6127.24]  Maybe they're super reputable.
[6127.36 --> 6127.70]  I don't know.
[6127.76 --> 6129.82]  The point is it was a microtransaction game.
[6130.66 --> 6139.22]  And I look at something like that and I go, okay, so the one side of me, like the business side of me looks at that and goes, wow, that was a lot of money.
[6139.66 --> 6141.00]  That would have been pretty okay.
[6141.78 --> 6142.18]  Right?
[6142.18 --> 6157.92]  And then there's the, like, the more creative side of me that looks at, looks at a game like CrossCode, I think is a perfect example of the game that I would make if I was smart enough and talented enough and had the vision to make.
[6158.00 --> 6158.74]  Like, it's so good.
[6159.82 --> 6165.18]  But I can't imagine that it made them the same kind of money as YouTuber Simulator.
[6165.42 --> 6167.96]  And I'm sitting here going, where's the middle ground here?
[6168.00 --> 6171.30]  I actually, I actually don't, I don't know.
[6171.42 --> 6174.38]  Like, theoretically, episodic gaming was supposed to be it.
[6174.62 --> 6175.20]  That it wasn't.
[6175.22 --> 6185.04]  Ongoing revenue so that you can not just, you know, push and release and then lay off everybody and just have this toxic cycle, right?
[6185.04 --> 6186.48]  Like, it was supposed to make things sustainable.
[6186.48 --> 6201.36]  But in the longer term, it ended up being microtransactions, cosmetics, and then, you know, ultimately performance advantages in many games because that's the way to best motivate people to just keep putting money into the machine, right?
[6201.36 --> 6207.32]  So, with all that in mind, right?
[6207.32 --> 6212.32]  Like, obviously, I recognize issues with the gaming industry, but I want no part of it.
[6212.32 --> 6217.66]  Yeah, and a lot of those issues are, oof, not to be that guy.
[6217.66 --> 6220.92]  But a lot of those issues are because of the community's behavior.
[6221.66 --> 6234.94]  Like, if people didn't buy excessively microtransactions to insane amounts, giving companies millions and millions and millions and millions of more dollars than they would have otherwise gotten, they would not make games entirely based around microtransactions.
[6235.84 --> 6238.08]  Like, it works because the community embraces it.
[6238.32 --> 6240.12]  And people are going to be like, oh, I don't embrace it.
[6240.16 --> 6241.02]  It's like, yeah, good.
[6241.34 --> 6242.32]  But other people do.
[6242.32 --> 6245.20]  And it only takes a small number.
[6245.70 --> 6247.50]  That's the thing that was really surprising to me.
[6247.56 --> 6254.16]  When I found out what percentage of the revenue of the mobile gaming industry comes from the whales and how few there are.
[6254.24 --> 6266.78]  Like, the fact that you'll have artists sitting designing specific items for a whale who you know is going to buy it, like, according to their tastes.
[6266.78 --> 6268.98]  Luke blew my mind when he told me this.
[6268.98 --> 6274.68]  Like, some $500 cosmetic item that they don't tell that person.
[6275.24 --> 6277.08]  They don't, like, write them a letter.
[6277.80 --> 6282.12]  But they know that they're not going to be able to resist, you know, that one.
[6282.58 --> 6285.74]  And someone will sit and make it knowing they will sell one.
[6285.98 --> 6294.70]  Or, like, they really like large, gratuitous swords that are shaped in a particular way and look really aggressive.
[6294.98 --> 6296.14]  They buy just all of them.
[6296.14 --> 6297.62]  So it's like, okay, we'll just make another one of those.
[6297.74 --> 6298.24]  Guaranteed sale.
[6299.98 --> 6300.24]  Yeah.
[6300.78 --> 6312.78]  My, something that's been kind of worrying me is the loss of, I know I always find ways to tie it back, but whatever, is the loss of Bethesda-style games.
[6313.28 --> 6320.92]  Because there are very few other companies that have really tried to make the really actually same type of thing.
[6320.92 --> 6326.92]  There's games that get kind of similar, but there's kind of a Bethesda ID.
[6327.28 --> 6329.80]  This game where it's completely open.
[6329.92 --> 6332.82]  You can just never do the main quest ever if you don't want.
[6332.82 --> 6336.26]  It's more about constructing this interesting universe.
[6336.38 --> 6337.42]  You can do whatever you want in it.
[6337.64 --> 6342.60]  I think their biggest departure from this was Fallout 4 that has me a little bit concerned about Starfield, but I'm sure it'll still be a good game.
[6342.66 --> 6343.28]  Whatever, it doesn't matter.
[6344.72 --> 6346.62]  But, yeah, I'm a little worried about that.
[6347.48 --> 6349.24]  How did you never get into Breath of the Wild?
[6349.30 --> 6350.44]  That still blows me away.
[6350.86 --> 6351.10]  Yeah.
[6351.28 --> 6355.54]  That's like the whole thing, is you just get dumped into this world and you just go exploring.
[6355.68 --> 6359.76]  I should probably just emulate it, because I really didn't enjoy playing it on a Switch.
[6359.84 --> 6360.56]  Yeah, you just emulate it.
[6360.56 --> 6362.82]  It's really easy now.
[6363.68 --> 6364.58]  Like, stupid easy.
[6364.72 --> 6366.06]  Like, I could just set it up for you.
[6366.34 --> 6368.74]  No, I'll do it myself, but like, yeah, maybe I'll do it sometime.
[6369.04 --> 6370.50]  I haven't had a ton of gaming time lately.
[6370.58 --> 6377.80]  I mean, unless you're planning to actually dump your own ROMs and your own firmware off of your Switch, I could help you set it up.
[6378.18 --> 6379.26]  I will do that.
[6380.90 --> 6381.26]  Okay.
[6383.72 --> 6385.04]  I have pictures of birds.
[6385.42 --> 6387.10]  People were asking for pictures of birds.
[6387.60 --> 6388.36]  Here are my birds.
[6388.86 --> 6389.94]  There's one of my birds.
[6389.94 --> 6390.98]  His name is Wally.
[6391.62 --> 6392.26]  Cute boy.
[6392.88 --> 6393.94]  Here is other bird.
[6394.22 --> 6395.12]  His name is Scoopy.
[6395.46 --> 6396.20]  Or just Scoop.
[6396.62 --> 6397.46]  Also cute boy.
[6400.80 --> 6401.54]  There you go.
[6401.98 --> 6403.04]  No pirating done here.
[6403.10 --> 6403.56]  Just birds.
[6406.86 --> 6408.16]  No privateering.
[6408.16 --> 6410.54]  You might as well have it on your shoulder, Luke.
[6410.66 --> 6411.54]  It's a parrot.
[6417.48 --> 6419.64]  That is specifically why I chose that timing.
[6419.64 --> 6423.86]  I have been waiting to do it, but I did want to do it right then because of that.
[6425.06 --> 6426.52]  But yeah, those are my birds.
[6426.62 --> 6427.08]  Scoop and Wally.
[6428.54 --> 6428.86]  Okay.
[6429.22 --> 6431.70]  Should we talk about how emojis can be legally binding?
[6432.04 --> 6432.38]  Yeah.
[6432.60 --> 6433.54]  This is pretty funny.
[6434.06 --> 6434.40]  No.
[6434.74 --> 6435.02]  No.
[6435.02 --> 6437.84]  I wanted to talk about the anti-telemarketing bot.
[6438.02 --> 6438.58]  Ah, yes.
[6438.72 --> 6438.94]  Okay.
[6438.94 --> 6439.34]  Okay.
[6440.00 --> 6444.44]  Jolly Roger has updated its bots with ChatGPT and AI voice generation.
[6445.08 --> 6459.50]  The service is designed to waste telemarketers' time through meandering conversations with a variety of bot personas, including an overwhelmed mother, a rambling drunk, and an elderly man who just woke up from a nap.
[6459.50 --> 6477.42]  When a human telemarketer connects, the bot spends a few minutes giving generic pre-programmed responses, like rambling about needing coffee, asking the caller to repeat their name, telling them they sound like a former classmate, and interjecting with the occasional mm-hmm and uh-huh in the background.
[6477.42 --> 6485.48]  ChatGPT assesses the telemarketer's spiel, then outputs relevant responses in the bot's chosen persona.
[6486.04 --> 6492.70]  This is apparently particularly effective, given that the primary tactic of telemarketers is to keep their target on the phone as long as possible.
[6493.66 --> 6502.50]  Likewise, malicious scammers prefer to prey on people who don't seem totally mentally with it, especially seniors, making this a pretty effective counter.
[6502.50 --> 6507.56]  Now, what I want to know is, how do you actually implement this on your phone?
[6507.66 --> 6510.62]  I want everyone who calls me to talk to Jolly Roger.
[6515.24 --> 6516.08]  Oh, man.
[6519.12 --> 6521.46]  Get started for mobile and landlines.
[6521.56 --> 6523.26]  Okay, what am I even looking at here?
[6523.80 --> 6526.68]  Thank you for signing up if you want to know how to set up a mobile phone.
[6526.78 --> 6527.00]  Hello.
[6527.34 --> 6528.32]  Jolly Roger telephone.
[6528.52 --> 6530.62]  Okay, download the Captain's Log app.
[6530.62 --> 6535.84]  It's fun, free, and makes it really easy to set up your phone to forward unanswered calls to us for screening.
[6537.06 --> 6537.46]  Ooh.
[6538.04 --> 6538.44]  Okay.
[6539.16 --> 6540.56]  So it doesn't happen locally?
[6541.44 --> 6542.40]  Apparently not.
[6543.00 --> 6543.20]  Hmm.
[6543.70 --> 6543.94]  Hmm.
[6544.46 --> 6545.10]  I mean...
[6545.10 --> 6545.26]  Hmm.
[6545.70 --> 6548.64]  So you upload your phone contacts into an allow list.
[6549.96 --> 6551.54]  You can have a personal greeting.
[6552.34 --> 6552.74]  Hmm.
[6554.78 --> 6555.82]  Who are you, people?
[6555.82 --> 6560.96]  I would have liked it more if you chose to send the phone call to it.
[6561.70 --> 6566.28]  Then I don't care if it's happening remotely or whatever.
[6566.92 --> 6569.72]  Robots available in US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.
[6570.00 --> 6573.52]  Service available to Canadians, but requires long-distance calling to the US.
[6573.60 --> 6575.96]  Okay, I think I'm out for now.
[6576.88 --> 6577.82]  But overall...
[6578.26 --> 6579.78]  It sounds pretty funny.
[6580.66 --> 6582.84]  I just don't know if I'm going to use it.
[6583.04 --> 6583.28]  Yeah.
[6583.28 --> 6584.42]  Okay, what were we going to talk about?
[6586.22 --> 6586.58]  Emojis.
[6586.94 --> 6587.38]  Yeah.
[6587.74 --> 6589.14]  Emojis can be legally binding.
[6589.30 --> 6595.26]  A Canadian court has ruled that an emoji can be considered a binding signature to a legal contract.
[6595.66 --> 6600.36]  In March of 2021, Kent Mickleborough, a Canadian grain buyer,
[6600.36 --> 6604.54]  sent out text messages to several farmers in the vicinity
[6604.54 --> 6608.34]  talking about how he was looking to buy 86 tons of flax
[6608.34 --> 6612.52]  at a price of $17 Canadian per bushel.
[6612.52 --> 6614.12]  All righty.
[6614.36 --> 6617.36]  Chris Actor, a Canadian farmer, responded to the text
[6617.36 --> 6620.08]  and both got into correspondence on the phone.
[6620.74 --> 6625.56]  Mickleborough then proceeded to send a picture of the contract to Actor,
[6625.72 --> 6628.24]  asking him to confirm the contract.
[6628.58 --> 6630.78]  Actor responded with a thumbs-up emoji,
[6631.20 --> 6633.04]  but did not otherwise follow up.
[6633.36 --> 6636.60]  By November, the time when the contract was supposed to be fulfilled,
[6636.96 --> 6639.68]  flax had risen to $41 a bushel.
[6639.82 --> 6640.30]  Yikes.
[6640.30 --> 6641.56]  Over twice the amount.
[6641.90 --> 6642.10]  Yeah.
[6642.42 --> 6645.96]  Mickleborough then sued Actor for failing to provide the requested flax,
[6646.32 --> 6649.84]  arguing that the emoji was an agreement to the terms of the contract.
[6650.30 --> 6655.02]  Actor argued in turn that he was merely confirming that he had received the contract,
[6655.14 --> 6656.88]  not that he agreed to it,
[6657.14 --> 6662.12]  and that he assumed that another contract would be sent more formally through fax or email.
[6662.60 --> 6663.70]  Now, according to the court's...
[6663.70 --> 6664.64]  That's not a terrible argument.
[6664.64 --> 6666.66]  I think that's actually a pretty good argument.
[6667.06 --> 6669.74]  Now, according to the court's filing, he will be required...
[6669.74 --> 6670.26]  Really?
[6670.98 --> 6671.22]  Yeah.
[6671.36 --> 6673.22]  No, this is done.
[6675.52 --> 6676.44]  That's garbage.
[6676.78 --> 6677.52]  This is confirmed.
[6677.72 --> 6682.34]  According to the court's ruling, he will be required to pay $82,000 Canadian dollars,
[6682.40 --> 6686.40]  so about $4 American, plus interest for failing to deliver the flax.
[6686.40 --> 6688.62]  Discussion question.
[6688.74 --> 6693.04]  Should something as ambiguous as an emoji really be considered a legally binding statement?
[6693.62 --> 6699.60]  Um, I mean, if he put the emoji in the signature section of the contract, like, maybe?
[6699.92 --> 6700.34]  But then...
[6700.34 --> 6702.28]  But that's not what happened in the slightest.
[6702.28 --> 6703.76]  But verbal contracts are binding here.
[6704.56 --> 6705.44]  So that's something.
[6705.82 --> 6706.28]  Canada's a weird place.
[6706.28 --> 6709.74]  An emoji is a lot more documented than just a verbal agreement.
[6709.74 --> 6712.14]  You know about how we, like, don't actually really have any rights, right?
[6712.20 --> 6713.02]  Have I talked to you about that before?
[6713.02 --> 6713.24]  Yeah.
[6713.34 --> 6713.50]  Yeah.
[6713.64 --> 6715.06]  Canada's sick.
[6716.30 --> 6718.00]  Yeah, that's really stupid.
[6718.64 --> 6720.72]  Because the way that actor...
[6720.72 --> 6722.04]  I hope I'm saying that name right.
[6722.10 --> 6724.50]  I'm pretty sure about Mickleborough, but actor, I'm not certain.
[6725.66 --> 6731.68]  The way that they said that they did this, or they said they confirmed they received the contract,
[6731.68 --> 6734.72]  that's a very normal way to do things.
[6736.32 --> 6740.66]  See a message, give it a thumbs up as, like, I've seen this, whatever.
[6742.20 --> 6742.56]  Yeah.
[6743.02 --> 6743.46]  Uh...
[6743.46 --> 6747.66]  It's a little bit of a stretch, I think.
[6753.10 --> 6758.44]  The judge said it appears the deal was at least verbally struck, according to the documents.
[6760.74 --> 6761.22]  Wow.
[6761.52 --> 6765.14]  Is it the emoji that won this court case then, or no?
[6765.14 --> 6765.98]  The judge wrote,
[6765.98 --> 6771.08]  I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Chris okayed or approved the contract,
[6771.20 --> 6775.72]  just like he had done before, except this time he used a thumbs up emoji.
[6776.22 --> 6780.82]  In my opinion, when considering all of the circumstances, that meant approval of the Flax contract,
[6781.00 --> 6784.20]  and not simply that he had received the contract and was going to think about it.
[6784.20 --> 6793.50]  In my view, a reasonable bystander, knowing all the background, would come into this and come to the same objective understanding that the parties had reached a consensus.
[6794.94 --> 6795.22]  Um...
[6795.22 --> 6795.98]  I don't agree.
[6795.98 --> 6798.04]  Like they had done on numerous other occasions, though.
[6798.16 --> 6799.42]  That's something that we're missing here.
[6799.42 --> 6799.76]  That's an interesting one.
[6799.86 --> 6800.18]  Yes.
[6800.38 --> 6804.72]  So this is not some rando contract from some rando you've never dealt with before.
[6804.86 --> 6806.42]  If this is how they've done it in the past...
[6806.42 --> 6809.44]  If this is, hey, have we got a price?
[6809.62 --> 6815.60]  If the only item was price, and you're basically like, here's the contract with the price we discussed,
[6815.82 --> 6817.66]  and someone's like, yep.
[6819.56 --> 6820.92]  Depends on the wording a bit.
[6821.40 --> 6822.10]  A bit.
[6823.30 --> 6823.82]  Um...
[6823.82 --> 6825.12]  It also depends on precedent.
[6825.30 --> 6826.64]  Like if they have done a...
[6826.64 --> 6832.38]  If a contract has been sent in the past, and he thumbsed it up, and then they followed through and that contract was fulfilled,
[6833.00 --> 6835.74]  then I would be like, absolutely, yes, it completely is that.
[6836.42 --> 6836.72]  Yeah.
[6836.82 --> 6840.76]  But I have absolutely thumbs things up as like, I have received this.
[6842.70 --> 6843.40]  You know?
[6843.58 --> 6844.42]  Like I...
[6844.42 --> 6852.02]  I was hoping to get like screenshots of exactly what the texts were, but none of the source articles here appear to have it.
[6852.02 --> 6855.00]  Yeah, I'm assuming it's, um, tied up in court or something.
[6855.32 --> 6855.72]  Yeah.
[6855.72 --> 6856.86]  I don't know much about legal process.
[6856.98 --> 6858.02]  Yeah, I...
[6858.02 --> 6862.20]  What I hope is that if we saw the actual exchange of text messages,
[6862.20 --> 6867.00]  it would become very obvious that they were agreeing to the contract,
[6867.12 --> 6868.48]  but otherwise, that's...
[6868.48 --> 6870.28]  That's pretty freaky, man.
[6870.62 --> 6871.02]  Yeah.
[6871.28 --> 6872.42]  Like if you...
[6872.42 --> 6876.38]  Well, we have issues here where like someone will digitally sign something
[6876.38 --> 6879.04]  in like a font that doesn't really look like a signature,
[6879.28 --> 6882.70]  and we'll be like, ah, it should probably look more like it was properly signed.
[6883.12 --> 6885.12]  And then this dude send an emoji.
[6885.12 --> 6885.68]  What?
[6887.38 --> 6888.62]  Is that an issue we have?
[6889.18 --> 6889.70]  It's...
[6889.70 --> 6890.70]  It has been before.
[6890.80 --> 6891.24]  Oh, okay.
[6891.72 --> 6893.34]  Signatures are the stupidest...
[6893.34 --> 6894.16]  They're just so dumb.
[6894.20 --> 6896.96]  The stupidest possible validation of anything.
[6897.08 --> 6897.48]  Absolutely.
[6898.12 --> 6898.90]  If it's a...
[6898.90 --> 6902.02]  If it's witnessed by a notary or whatever, like that's at least something.
[6902.60 --> 6904.18]  But just...
[6904.18 --> 6905.12]  Man, have you ever had...
[6905.12 --> 6909.78]  Have you ever had a cashier like not accept your credit card because the back isn't signed?
[6909.78 --> 6911.80]  I pretty much guarantee mine isn't right now.
[6911.96 --> 6913.72]  Like, don't pull it out on stream.
[6913.72 --> 6914.88]  I wasn't going to...
[6914.88 --> 6915.30]  Oh, okay.
[6915.36 --> 6916.86]  I was going to do it on the table, but it doesn't matter.
[6917.12 --> 6917.30]  Yeah.
[6917.40 --> 6919.08]  But I don't think I've ever signed a credit card.
[6919.98 --> 6920.38]  Okay.
[6920.56 --> 6924.44]  Have you ever had them ask you to sign it before they'll let you use it?
[6924.46 --> 6926.38]  No, but I know people that have had that before.
[6927.00 --> 6927.16]  Yeah.
[6928.12 --> 6930.16]  What does that prove?
[6930.42 --> 6931.68]  I used to be a stickler.
[6932.56 --> 6933.46]  When I first...
[6933.46 --> 6938.18]  When I had my first retail job ever, I would check ID for every single credit card.
[6939.28 --> 6940.04]  Because that's...
[6940.04 --> 6941.10]  I was told to do that.
[6941.14 --> 6941.66]  So I was like, okay.
[6942.22 --> 6942.46]  Yeah.
[6942.52 --> 6943.24]  And I just did it.
[6943.24 --> 6945.20]  I checked ID every single time.
[6945.28 --> 6947.78]  And I would legitimately like actually try to pair it.
[6947.88 --> 6949.02]  That was NCIX policy.
[6949.32 --> 6949.48]  Yeah.
[6949.54 --> 6950.92]  Some people would get really mad.
[6951.14 --> 6952.32]  They'd be like, I don't want to show you my ID.
[6952.42 --> 6953.90]  I'd be like, then I don't want to take your credit card.
[6954.00 --> 6954.60]  I don't really...
[6954.60 --> 6955.50]  I would do the same thing.
[6955.56 --> 6955.74]  Yeah.
[6955.74 --> 6956.74]  And then I...
[6956.74 --> 6964.60]  I don't know if I've ever been ID'd for using my credit card.
[6964.60 --> 6966.16]  For any value amount.
[6966.28 --> 6967.20]  Yeah, but it's pins now.
[6968.00 --> 6968.14]  Yeah.
[6968.30 --> 6969.26]  You're a young boy.
[6969.38 --> 6970.04]  I got ID'd.
[6970.80 --> 6971.18]  Okay.
[6971.34 --> 6972.06]  I was older than you.
[6972.26 --> 6972.88]  So it was...
[6972.88 --> 6973.56]  It was still...
[6973.56 --> 6973.82]  No, no.
[6973.86 --> 6976.66]  I was ID'ing people when they were putting in pins and stuff.
[6977.26 --> 6978.80]  Oh, you don't have to do that.
[6980.12 --> 6981.64]  They told me I did at the time.
[6982.86 --> 6983.78]  Where was this?
[6984.04 --> 6984.82]  This was Best Buy.
[6985.54 --> 6985.94]  What?
[6986.20 --> 6986.82]  I don't know.
[6987.22 --> 6987.98]  Yeah, that's stupid.
[6988.32 --> 6988.60]  I...
[6988.60 --> 6990.08]  Well, pins are not very secure.
[6990.24 --> 6994.06]  They're a lot more secure than like, no, this is like definitely totally me.
[6994.08 --> 6995.70]  It has a signature on the back for sure.
[6995.82 --> 6996.08]  Yeah.
[6996.22 --> 6996.50]  Like...
[6996.50 --> 6996.76]  Yeah.
[6997.12 --> 6997.34]  Yeah.
[6998.26 --> 6998.66]  Yeah.
[6998.76 --> 6999.46]  No, we...
[6999.46 --> 7000.82]  No, I absolutely...
[7000.82 --> 7002.26]  I absolutely had to...
[7002.26 --> 7002.64]  Oh, man.
[7002.64 --> 7003.84]  This is reminding me of stuff.
[7003.86 --> 7004.20]  People are talking...
[7004.20 --> 7008.18]  Like, Conrad in chat just mentioned that he taps things up to $400.
[7008.78 --> 7009.34]  That's wild.
[7009.82 --> 7010.86]  Tap doesn't take a pin.
[7011.38 --> 7014.02]  Kumostar says, all my credit cards say CID.
[7014.18 --> 7016.02]  That's something I used to see a lot back in the day.
[7016.48 --> 7017.16]  You write it in the...
[7017.16 --> 7020.06]  People would write that in the signature thing because they...
[7020.06 --> 7023.56]  They understand that signatures mean absolutely nothing.
[7023.72 --> 7025.80]  And if someone steals their card, they want them to...
[7025.80 --> 7028.96]  Then again, if I stole someone's credit card and it said CID on the back,
[7029.00 --> 7031.06]  I'm sure I could come up with a creative way to...
[7032.12 --> 7034.58]  Use some isopropyl alcohol to remove it.
[7034.58 --> 7035.12]  Yeah, just get rid of it.
[7035.26 --> 7039.22]  Just sign over top of it with some kind of chicken scratch signature or whatever.
[7039.34 --> 7040.06]  Like, I really...
[7041.22 --> 7044.74]  Why are we still using pieces of plastic to move our money around?
[7044.80 --> 7045.62]  I don't understand it.
[7046.00 --> 7047.52]  All the tap limits I'm seeing.
[7047.52 --> 7050.44]  I don't know how Conrad has one for $400.
[7050.74 --> 7053.22]  Someone else in chat says they have one for $600 though.
[7053.28 --> 7054.20]  So this is apparently a thing.
[7054.32 --> 7054.76]  Mine's $200.
[7054.96 --> 7055.48]  I Googled it.
[7055.54 --> 7056.42]  They're all saying $250.
[7056.72 --> 7059.62]  But there's multiple people in chat saying that they have one for more than that.
[7059.84 --> 7060.14]  So what?
[7060.24 --> 7060.56]  You can...
[7060.56 --> 7061.52]  This person tapped...
[7062.18 --> 7067.48]  I tapped to pay with my phone at a micro center for $600.
[7069.18 --> 7071.52]  So you don't need ID for a $600 transaction?
[7071.78 --> 7072.30]  That's wild.
[7072.38 --> 7073.30]  That's a lot of money.
[7073.30 --> 7075.36]  Like, we're going all the way back.
[7076.48 --> 7078.54]  The pins are, like, useless now.
[7079.44 --> 7079.90]  Yeah, that's true.
[7079.90 --> 7083.66]  It's like, how many times are you going to process a transaction for more than your tap limit?
[7084.62 --> 7086.10]  I, like, never have it happen.
[7086.22 --> 7089.84]  You know, I would say that it would...
[7089.84 --> 7091.30]  Okay, I would...
[7092.16 --> 7094.84]  Far be it from me to just...
[7094.84 --> 7100.22]  Far be it from me to just come up with, you know, a security best practice live on the WAN show.
[7100.22 --> 7105.54]  But I'd say it's probably not unreasonable to just disable the taps on your cards.
[7106.16 --> 7107.34]  Just gouge the chips out.
[7107.64 --> 7113.58]  And then if you want to tap, then you should ingest your card into your phone and use your phone for tap payments.
[7114.40 --> 7115.58]  And then you can still...
[7115.58 --> 7116.48]  You'll still be able to use your card.
[7116.48 --> 7117.34]  I never use my phone.
[7117.48 --> 7119.30]  Do you have to unlock your phone to tap pay?
[7119.32 --> 7120.76]  Yeah, you have to unlock your phone.
[7120.88 --> 7120.96]  Yeah.
[7120.96 --> 7127.64]  So then at least you're adding some amount of validation to any kind of contactless payment.
[7127.84 --> 7129.66]  And you can still use your card with a pin.
[7130.58 --> 7132.00]  Like, you can still insert it.
[7132.12 --> 7134.40]  It's a separate chip.
[7134.86 --> 7137.94]  It's not the RFID chip that is used for...
[7137.94 --> 7138.02]  Oh.
[7138.90 --> 7141.30]  Apparently there's no tap limit in the U.S.
[7142.10 --> 7143.68]  There can't be no tap limit.
[7143.68 --> 7147.02]  Someone in the chat said, I tapped without ID for a $1,200 chair.
[7147.86 --> 7148.74]  That's stupid.
[7150.44 --> 7152.34]  I've tapped a different person.
[7152.46 --> 7154.28]  I've tapped $1,200 in a foreign country.
[7154.44 --> 7158.50]  A different person I tapped to pay $1,700 at a micro center.
[7160.10 --> 7162.34]  That's actually completely bananas.
[7162.34 --> 7165.94]  This is like going back to checkbooks.
[7166.34 --> 7170.66]  Except people can just write checks and they don't even need to sign the checks.
[7170.78 --> 7175.04]  They just hand checks to people and they just use your money.
[7175.46 --> 7176.38]  That's wild.
[7177.26 --> 7179.00]  Elon tapped to buy Twitter.
[7182.74 --> 7183.22]  Okay.
[7183.88 --> 7185.64]  Elon tapped for other reasons.
[7190.08 --> 7191.76]  Help make sure we don't run out of people.
[7192.34 --> 7198.04]  It's a major concern, Luke.
[7199.18 --> 7204.58]  I regularly charge people $3,500 and they can tap no problem.
[7205.04 --> 7209.18]  I tapped to pay like $2,500 for my PC build components last year.
[7209.80 --> 7210.80]  Oh, it was on my iPhone.
[7210.92 --> 7211.68]  That's a little different.
[7211.86 --> 7212.52]  Yeah, that's different.
[7212.60 --> 7213.24]  That's validated.
[7213.38 --> 7214.04]  That's not a tap.
[7214.04 --> 7214.22]  Yeah.
[7214.62 --> 7216.62]  You're signing into your phone.
[7216.78 --> 7217.62]  That is definitely different.
[7217.68 --> 7217.82]  Yeah.
[7217.92 --> 7218.06]  No.
[7218.06 --> 7222.16]  When we're talking tap, we're talking when you have just the card.
[7222.34 --> 7224.20]  Just the credit card or the bank card.
[7224.76 --> 7227.14]  And you just touch it on something.
[7227.68 --> 7228.24]  No fingerprint.
[7228.24 --> 7235.04]  $88 in Flowplane chat said, I work for Capital One Bank and yes, you can tap for up to $5,000 for your card.
[7236.72 --> 7237.64]  That's stupid.
[7237.64 --> 7243.30]  You can tap for what my gut is going to tell me has got to be more than most people's credit limits.
[7244.72 --> 7246.64]  I have no idea what the average credit limit is.
[7246.64 --> 7250.46]  Not a clue, but I can't imagine it's more than $5,000.
[7250.46 --> 7254.40]  You know, I had a really funny conversation with Ploof.
[7254.64 --> 7262.64]  We were discussing just like, you know, credit card usage and, you know, frugal lifestyle.
[7262.96 --> 7268.92]  I was talking about how someone was like complaining about how out of touch I am because I'm always saying don't buy cheap garbage.
[7268.92 --> 7274.48]  Buy used good stuff because it costs the same and it lasts longer and performs better.
[7275.74 --> 7277.14]  And that's not out of touch.
[7277.20 --> 7279.18]  And if you think it's out of touch, you're actually stupid.
[7279.86 --> 7279.96]  Yeah.
[7280.00 --> 7282.38]  No, it's the thing that comes up like quite often, actually.
[7282.38 --> 7283.08]  You'd be surprised.
[7283.20 --> 7283.34]  Yeah.
[7283.34 --> 7288.06]  Well, all you got to do is go read the comments on any of those don't buy cheap GPUs videos.
[7288.40 --> 7289.58]  Like you remember that, right?
[7289.72 --> 7289.96]  Yeah.
[7290.12 --> 7290.30]  Yeah.
[7290.54 --> 7292.10]  Oh, how elitist Linus.
[7292.54 --> 7293.88]  Some people can't afford better.
[7294.24 --> 7295.04]  That's not the point.
[7296.16 --> 7296.80]  Oh my God.
[7297.42 --> 7298.26]  We have been there.
[7298.40 --> 7299.26]  Go buy used stuff.
[7299.30 --> 7299.68]  It's better.
[7299.68 --> 7311.40]  So we were talking about sort of like the frugal lifestyle because I was saying like a lot of the way that I look at used versus new products comes from not growing up with money.
[7311.40 --> 7318.80]  And he was talking about we actually drove the same model of car at some point.
[7319.16 --> 7328.58]  And he was talking about how like, yeah, he uses his credit card for everything, but he was always just like completely anal about paying it off.
[7329.08 --> 7337.76]  And he said that a big part of the reason for it was actually that he had a fundamental misunderstanding about how interest works on credit cards.
[7337.76 --> 7345.32]  And what I realized is that a lot of the anxiety that I had about carrying a balance on my credit card.
[7345.46 --> 7347.48]  I started out with a $500 credit limit.
[7347.56 --> 7350.42]  And the reason is that and look, I don't care.
[7350.42 --> 7358.34]  People who are morally opposed to credit ratings or who think credit cards are the work of the devil or whatever.
[7358.56 --> 7360.26]  In North America, it's not how it works.
[7361.02 --> 7362.74]  It's really important to have a good credit rating.
[7363.02 --> 7366.48]  And having a credit card that you pay off all the time is actually not detrimental.
[7366.82 --> 7371.48]  It is actually beneficial to you because there are benefits of paying with a credit card versus paying with a debit card.
[7371.70 --> 7373.36]  I really don't feel like debating it with you.
[7373.60 --> 7373.98]  You're wrong.
[7373.98 --> 7378.14]  So I had a $500 credit limit credit card.
[7378.20 --> 7391.62]  And one of the reasons that it was so low was that I wanted to make sure that I never, ever carried a balance on it because I thought that the 23% interest or whatever was immediately owed.
[7392.34 --> 7394.24]  If you carried your balance to the next month.
[7394.24 --> 7409.04]  And it wasn't until he told me that that was a big part of why he was so on top of his credit card all the time that I realized, holy crap, I thought the exact same thing until sometime into my adult life.
[7409.12 --> 7416.50]  I don't remember exactly when I figured out that it was an annual interest rate, but then like billed monthly.
[7416.50 --> 7425.00]  So I thought that if I spent $100 and I didn't pay it back by the end of the month, I would owe $123.
[7425.76 --> 7436.94]  So I used my credit card like cash and it baffled me that anyone ever lost track of how much they owed on their credit card because, oh my God, every $5 is $6.
[7437.54 --> 7439.46]  Who could possibly lose track of that?
[7443.48 --> 7444.50]  Oh, this is great.
[7444.58 --> 7445.04]  Flowplane chat.
[7445.12 --> 7445.76]  It's not?
[7445.76 --> 7446.16]  What?
[7446.22 --> 7448.08]  I'm 20 and this is news to me.
[7448.60 --> 7450.50]  It doesn't mean you shouldn't treat it that way.
[7450.62 --> 7452.88]  Yeah, the best advice I can give you is treat it like that.
[7452.90 --> 7453.10]  Yeah.
[7453.38 --> 7455.88]  Because that's exactly how you fall into the trap.
[7456.06 --> 7457.52]  Yeah, no, stop thinking you're dumb.
[7457.60 --> 7459.00]  There's all these people being like, I'm a moron.
[7459.14 --> 7459.50]  Stop.
[7460.12 --> 7460.86]  Like actually.
[7461.00 --> 7463.96]  Yeah, you're actually doing it good.
[7464.22 --> 7464.40]  Yeah.
[7464.48 --> 7466.48]  There's huge benefits.
[7466.68 --> 7468.82]  Again, I don't feel like debating this with Europeans.
[7469.04 --> 7469.60]  I don't care.
[7469.98 --> 7471.82]  What you think about it doesn't matter right now.
[7472.38 --> 7475.64]  There's huge, huge benefits to North Americans.
[7475.64 --> 7480.94]  For using a credit card regularly and always making sure that it's paid off.
[7480.94 --> 7483.30]  If you don't, you like can't buy a house and stuff.
[7483.48 --> 7484.18]  And stuff.
[7484.30 --> 7485.58]  Like it's actually extremely important.
[7485.58 --> 7486.58]  Like we're not going to talk about it.
[7486.70 --> 7486.80]  Yeah.
[7486.80 --> 7492.04]  But that's how they get you.
[7492.10 --> 7495.38]  As soon as you start carrying a balance, it creates that bad habit, right?
[7496.00 --> 7497.96]  So yeah, treat it like this.
[7498.74 --> 7499.46]  Oh man.
[7499.68 --> 7500.22]  Oh man.
[7500.34 --> 7500.86]  People in chat.
[7500.92 --> 7501.82]  Why did you tell me this?
[7501.86 --> 7504.00]  I would have lived better without this knowledge.
[7504.00 --> 7506.92]  The way that people are reacting actually has me actually concerned.
[7509.30 --> 7511.16]  I didn't see this coming.
[7511.66 --> 7513.66]  I didn't see people reacting this way.
[7513.72 --> 7516.46]  There's also a component of like usage limit as well.
[7516.92 --> 7522.76]  So if you have like $500 of credit, you can't have $500 on it.
[7522.76 --> 7524.44]  Otherwise you also get impacted.
[7525.00 --> 7528.82]  Like there's a, there's a point you can't use all of your allowed credit.
[7528.90 --> 7531.68]  Otherwise it also negatively affects your credit rating.
[7531.78 --> 7531.94]  Yeah.
[7531.94 --> 7537.40]  It's a whole, it's a whole like black magic to figure out exactly how the math works.
[7537.40 --> 7542.56]  But the best thing is to use it regularly and pay it off before the end of every month.
[7542.56 --> 7550.46]  I remember someone telling, cause one of my genius ideas was like, oh, well I only have
[7550.46 --> 7554.72]  like a crappy savings account anyway with like 0.8% interest or whatever.
[7554.72 --> 7559.22]  So just to make sure that I never go over my credit card limit, I'll just dump my savings
[7559.22 --> 7563.28]  into my credit card and then it'll always carry a positive balance.
[7563.74 --> 7567.46]  And so I'll just never have to like worry about accidentally whatever.
[7567.46 --> 7571.66]  And then I can spend more than my $500 credit limit on a single transaction as well, because
[7571.66 --> 7574.74]  I have like buffer, but then I was told that that's bad.
[7575.14 --> 7577.92]  Having it like overpaid all the time is like bad or something.
[7578.14 --> 7578.18]  Yeah.
[7578.18 --> 7579.16]  I didn't actually know that part.
[7579.30 --> 7579.44]  Yeah.
[7579.56 --> 7582.08]  That might not even be true or it might not be true anymore.
[7582.76 --> 7585.14]  Um, I remember Yvonne was telling me something.
[7585.14 --> 7588.50]  I often do that before trips on purpose, just in case like massive emergency.
[7588.70 --> 7589.46]  No, a little bit's fine.
[7589.90 --> 7590.16]  Okay.
[7590.26 --> 7592.10]  But yeah, just like always having it.
[7592.18 --> 7592.48]  I don't know.
[7592.50 --> 7593.58]  It looks weird or something.
[7593.76 --> 7595.16]  Anything that's like weird is bad.
[7595.36 --> 7595.80]  That makes sense.
[7595.86 --> 7600.02]  Yvonne was telling me that like having, um, this was for like a line of credit for the business
[7600.02 --> 7600.78]  or something like that.
[7600.78 --> 7601.78]  I'm like, I don't know, just get it.
[7601.80 --> 7602.98]  And then if we need it, then we have it.
[7602.98 --> 7605.66]  And she's like, no, no, if you like have it and don't use it, that's bad.
[7606.16 --> 7607.04]  And I was like, why?
[7607.60 --> 7611.30]  Then that just means you're a baller and you like, you know, can handle your bills or something.
[7611.34 --> 7612.88]  She's like, no, no, it's not how they see it.
[7612.96 --> 7613.74]  I'm like, all right, sure.
[7614.90 --> 7615.38]  Uh-oh.
[7616.18 --> 7616.44]  Oh.
[7617.36 --> 7618.20]  Don't go into details.
[7618.20 --> 7618.28]  Well, I don't know.
[7618.36 --> 7619.68]  This was for the business.
[7619.82 --> 7621.74]  I don't know if personally it was different.
[7622.10 --> 7622.22]  Okay.
[7622.42 --> 7624.18]  I'm going to have to look into that.
[7624.18 --> 7628.14]  Oh, man.
[7628.40 --> 7628.78]  I do.
[7628.78 --> 7631.02]  I do use Yvonne for financial advice.
[7631.84 --> 7633.34]  I messaged her a couple months ago.
[7633.42 --> 7634.90]  I was like, what credit card do I get?
[7634.96 --> 7635.50]  I don't know.
[7636.18 --> 7636.58]  Disclaimer.
[7636.70 --> 7638.28]  Yvonne is not a financial advisor.
[7638.48 --> 7639.66]  No, no, no, no, no.
[7639.98 --> 7640.86]  Oh, Lordy.
[7641.12 --> 7642.76]  Hey, she knows some stuff.
[7642.98 --> 7643.88]  She's smart and things.
[7645.96 --> 7647.92]  They should publish the algorithm.
[7647.92 --> 7651.14]  Yeah, that would be good for us, wouldn't it?
[7653.40 --> 7655.22]  Okay, moving on.
[7656.50 --> 7657.26]  Do you have any other?
[7657.94 --> 7667.04]  Yeah, Nintendo published their annual report for the last financial year, and they don't pay their executives completely asinine amounts of money.
[7667.20 --> 7668.42]  Yeah, I talked about this in Game Link.
[7668.54 --> 7669.54]  Go check it out.
[7669.76 --> 7670.00]  Yeah.
[7671.30 --> 7672.38]  Yeah, I don't know.
[7673.10 --> 7675.38]  I'm going to butcher all the names, so I'm not going to say them.
[7675.38 --> 7684.40]  But the top five are essentially $2.5 million, $2 million, $1.5 million, just over $1 million, and just under $1 million.
[7684.62 --> 7685.02]  A year.
[7685.38 --> 7685.54]  Yeah.
[7686.78 --> 7688.74]  Does this include stock value?
[7689.02 --> 7690.64]  This seems to be total compensation.
[7690.94 --> 7691.14]  Wow.
[7691.64 --> 7695.06]  Yeah, this is the total pay of their highest compensated employees.
[7695.68 --> 7698.82]  And apparently this is just relatively normal in Japan.
[7699.16 --> 7704.02]  The CEO of Sega gets about $3 million a year, and the president of Square Enix receives $4 million annually.
[7704.02 --> 7706.20]  Actually, it sounds like Nintendo's kind of cheaping out a little bit there.
[7706.80 --> 7716.10]  This is significantly below the total compensation received by game company CEOs elsewhere in the world, even if the base salaries are not dissimilar.
[7716.30 --> 7724.02]  So Andrew Wilson of EA has a salary of $1.3 million, but made $39 million in total compensation in 2020.
[7724.84 --> 7730.02]  EA's net income for 2021 was $837 million, while Nintendo's was $4.37 billion.
[7730.02 --> 7738.72]  Now, it should be noted, shareholders have since voted to reduce Wilson's compensation package, but he's still expected to make $20 million in 2023.
[7741.04 --> 7742.30]  Discussion question is,
[7742.40 --> 7746.80]  Is there a diminishing return in terms of incentive when it comes to absurdly high bonuses?
[7747.50 --> 7752.46]  Is having high but extremely unstable compensation a problem for long-term thinking and leadership?
[7752.66 --> 7754.48]  Yeah, that's absolutely a problem.
[7754.48 --> 7756.48]  Like, I, uh...
[7757.08 --> 7758.80]  Oh, man.
[7760.00 --> 7760.92]  Executive pay.
[7761.50 --> 7769.02]  Have you ever looked at the line divergence between, like, median worker pay and executive pay in North America?
[7769.16 --> 7773.36]  It's, like, actually ridiculous over the last, like, 50 years.
[7773.60 --> 7773.76]  Yeah.
[7773.76 --> 7774.36]  Um...
[7774.36 --> 7780.68]  It's kind of cool to see Nintendo not lose the plot here.
[7781.30 --> 7798.30]  Also, I do have to kind of wonder a little bit how they retain top talent when, you know, Nintendo's kind of the envy of the gaming industry when it comes to just consistently delivering gaming experiences that delight their customers year after year after year after year.
[7799.78 --> 7802.18]  Work culture in Japan is very different.
[7802.18 --> 7805.46]  I do know that company loyalty culture in Japan is much bigger.
[7805.48 --> 7811.50]  I was reading an article about, um, someone who runs a business, um, helping people quit their jobs.
[7812.24 --> 7817.56]  So they go in and represent them to, to go and quit the job.
[7817.56 --> 7823.92]  And they just, like, the person just, like, sits there while the representative explains that they're not going to be working there anymore.
[7824.14 --> 7824.82]  Yeah, it's like...
[7824.82 --> 7825.38]  In, like, a...
[7825.38 --> 7826.52]  It's like a really big thing.
[7826.54 --> 7827.56]  Smooth and tactful way.
[7827.68 --> 7828.50]  And I was like, what?
[7828.74 --> 7829.02]  Yeah.
[7829.88 --> 7830.32]  Yeah.
[7830.32 --> 7836.00]  Which, in some ways, I can respect a lot.
[7836.14 --> 7838.96]  And in other ways, I think, is rife for potential abuse.
[7839.18 --> 7846.38]  But honestly, from what I've heard over a bunch of years of not paying very much attention, it usually goes pretty well.
[7847.62 --> 7848.88]  Like, I don't know.
[7849.44 --> 7849.86]  I don't know.
[7850.72 --> 7851.42]  It's scary.
[7851.60 --> 7854.30]  If that happened here, I do not think it would go well.
[7854.30 --> 7857.30]  I think that's pretty weird.
[7857.56 --> 7857.84]  Yeah.
[7858.30 --> 7859.38]  Like, I just don't even...
[7859.38 --> 7861.00]  I don't mean here as in Linus Media Group.
[7861.06 --> 7862.38]  I mean here as in North America.
[7862.46 --> 7862.66]  Oh, no.
[7862.78 --> 7866.10]  I just mean, personally, if someone...
[7866.10 --> 7869.20]  I don't even think we'd let the stranger into the building.
[7869.68 --> 7870.98]  Like, why are they...
[7871.54 --> 7872.24]  Oh, oh.
[7872.24 --> 7873.22]  I don't even mean that.
[7873.40 --> 7873.68]  Oh.
[7873.92 --> 7874.54]  Oh, sorry.
[7874.80 --> 7876.20]  No, that happens in North America.
[7876.28 --> 7876.68]  That's a thing.
[7876.78 --> 7877.04]  Really?
[7877.20 --> 7878.02]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[7878.16 --> 7879.48]  That's a thing on both sides, too.
[7879.48 --> 7886.16]  You can hire an outside person to fire someone for you, and you can hire an outside person to quit for you.
[7886.28 --> 7886.74]  Really?
[7886.86 --> 7888.14]  Both of those things are a thing, yeah.
[7888.36 --> 7888.72]  Wow.
[7889.00 --> 7889.28]  Yeah.
[7889.52 --> 7890.30]  How about that?
[7890.56 --> 7894.48]  I meant the, like, absolutely immense amount of...
[7895.62 --> 7901.02]  The, like, social expectation from the country that you are loyal to your company.
[7901.84 --> 7903.72]  Hopefully I'm describing this properly.
[7903.80 --> 7904.78]  I do not mean to offend.
[7905.72 --> 7907.16]  But, yeah.
[7907.16 --> 7909.98]  I think that would be abused if it was here.
[7910.12 --> 7914.42]  And as far as my understanding goes, it doesn't really get abused there, which is cool.
[7914.98 --> 7922.20]  Modoru says, work culture in Japan makes it really hard to get rehired if you are, for whatever reason, let go or even quit of your own volition.
[7922.40 --> 7923.10]  That's unfortunate.
[7924.50 --> 7924.94]  That's...
[7924.94 --> 7925.86]  Wow.
[7926.42 --> 7927.32]  It's potentially really rough.
[7929.04 --> 7929.44]  Huh.
[7930.86 --> 7931.30]  Okay.
[7931.30 --> 7931.64]  Yeah, yeah.
[7932.84 --> 7933.44]  Pfft!
[7933.44 --> 7937.72]  Okay, well, yeah, here's good.
[7939.22 --> 7940.04]  Relatively speaking.
[7940.22 --> 7941.16]  I mean, we have our problems.
[7942.40 --> 7942.50]  Yeah.
[7943.50 --> 7945.38]  TikTok tries a novel approach.
[7946.08 --> 7946.70]  Book publishing.
[7947.36 --> 7948.82]  Sorry, I just really thought this was funny.
[7948.92 --> 7949.04]  Yeah, I know.
[7949.10 --> 7949.40]  Let's go.
[7949.86 --> 7956.88]  ByteDance appears to be ramping up its new publishing arm, Eighth Note Press, which started approaching self-published writers earlier this year.
[7956.88 --> 7966.24]  This might be an interesting opportunity for some authors, as TikTok has become an unexpected powerhouse in catapulting below-the-radar novels into smash hits.
[7966.84 --> 7975.38]  It has also raised concerns that ByteDance might use TikTok to squeeze out user-driven viral book recommendations through promotion of its own publications.
[7976.16 --> 7976.38]  Yep.
[7976.76 --> 7977.48]  That makes sense.
[7978.04 --> 7978.16]  Yep.
[7978.16 --> 7988.88]  Discussion question here is, I love this, are you more worried about ByteDance promoting pro-China books through their platform, or about vapid nonsense written by thirst trappers?
[7994.28 --> 7995.60]  Yeah, just both.
[7995.72 --> 7996.26]  I don't know.
[7998.36 --> 8000.68]  Are you actually expecting an actual answer?
[8001.08 --> 8001.32]  Yeah.
[8001.56 --> 8002.50]  Oh, man.
[8004.92 --> 8006.58]  Honestly, probably the second.
[8006.58 --> 8025.46]  I'm not going to tell you why I know about them, but there are some very low-quality, high-volume e-book platforms out there that are basically just like garbage for people who just want to read romance books.
[8025.78 --> 8026.48]  I knew it.
[8026.56 --> 8027.00]  Yeah.
[8027.16 --> 8028.46]  I was going to ask you if it was specifically.
[8028.60 --> 8030.36]  I'm immensely curious.
[8030.36 --> 8037.82]  I can tell you that it is very easy to spend a lot of microtransaction money on said platforms.
[8038.82 --> 8039.70]  Very easy.
[8039.94 --> 8041.32]  That is a thing that can happen.
[8041.32 --> 8041.60]  Why do you know this?
[8041.90 --> 8042.98]  I just, I know.
[8043.72 --> 8045.14]  There are things I know, Luke.
[8045.22 --> 8046.40]  Sometimes I know things.
[8049.52 --> 8049.96]  Huh.
[8050.52 --> 8050.96]  Yeah.
[8052.48 --> 8052.92]  Huh.
[8054.68 --> 8057.38]  Well, I know he will tell me no more than that.
[8057.72 --> 8058.98]  That's, yeah, it's going to be about it.
[8058.98 --> 8059.22]  Yeah.
[8060.34 --> 8065.02]  In other news, the 12-volt high-power connector has been replaced with a new standard.
[8065.20 --> 8069.40]  CI-SIG will be replacing it with one called 12-volt 2x6.
[8070.22 --> 8071.08]  Oh, good.
[8071.34 --> 8072.02]  Good name.
[8072.26 --> 8080.72]  The new specification lists no changes to the header, meaning that the new standard should be compatible with existing 12-volt high-power headers.
[8080.86 --> 8087.64]  The changes are expected to prevent power from flowing if the connector is not fully inserted, something that apparently wasn't a huge priority before.
[8087.64 --> 8089.54]  Notable changes.
[8089.92 --> 8094.66]  The depth of power terminals has been increased from 4.2 to 4.45 millimeters.
[8096.86 --> 8097.26]  Okay.
[8097.58 --> 8106.10]  The depth of the sense pin terminals has been decreased from 4 millimeters to 2.5, and the support cards up to 675 watts, up from just 600.
[8106.34 --> 8107.08]  So there you go.
[8107.16 --> 8109.98]  Hopefully we won't have any more burned ones, but also who knows.
[8109.98 --> 8112.44]  And I think that's pretty much it.
[8113.10 --> 8113.16]  Yeah.
[8113.26 --> 8115.06]  We could talk about Fairphone coming to America.
[8115.22 --> 8116.04]  That seems pretty good.
[8116.24 --> 8116.78]  That's about it.
[8116.86 --> 8117.80]  Fairphone is coming to America.
[8117.92 --> 8118.46]  A five-year warranty.
[8118.82 --> 8119.44]  Hey, Fairphone.
[8119.68 --> 8119.92]  Sick.
[8120.26 --> 8120.44]  Yeah.
[8120.60 --> 8122.36]  Why don't we do some merch messages, Dan?
[8122.54 --> 8123.40]  What do you got for me?
[8123.48 --> 8124.38]  For when after dark?
[8124.50 --> 8126.02]  It's time for when after dark.
[8126.58 --> 8126.98]  When?
[8127.16 --> 8127.52]  Now.
[8127.88 --> 8128.20]  When?
[8129.88 --> 8130.56]  After dark.
[8130.56 --> 8132.76]  What?
[8138.76 --> 8139.88]  I'm looking at potentials.
[8139.88 --> 8142.44]  Are you going to try to defeat me at bubble hockey after Wancho today?
[8142.76 --> 8144.16]  I'm still undefeated.
[8145.16 --> 8145.96]  Yvonne got close.
[8146.20 --> 8146.98]  I can try.
[8147.08 --> 8153.22]  I think I'll only have one game in me because my back is very tired, and that machine is short.
[8153.22 --> 8158.00]  I discovered that people actually build platforms to lift it up because they're at my height.
[8158.80 --> 8159.24]  That makes sense.
[8159.24 --> 8160.70]  Yeah, that's the thing that definitely makes sense.
[8160.70 --> 8164.30]  I actually can't play too many games in a row because the tight.
[8165.64 --> 8167.64]  I wonder if part of it is just the tension.
[8168.22 --> 8169.14]  Oh, very possibly.
[8169.34 --> 8172.66]  Because if you're just relaxed and playing, it should be fine.
[8172.70 --> 8174.28]  No, I'd have to squat to do that.
[8174.44 --> 8176.82]  I can't use the controls properly.
[8177.80 --> 8178.14]  Really?
[8178.44 --> 8179.26]  I don't think so.
[8179.38 --> 8180.50]  I think you probably.
[8180.78 --> 8184.32]  Or I'd be cranking my neck like crazy, which is just going to create a new problem.
[8184.70 --> 8185.10]  Like there's no.
[8185.22 --> 8185.44]  Yeah.
[8186.56 --> 8189.22]  Basically, I bought a super checks machine.
[8189.24 --> 8190.98]  Because I am an idiot.
[8191.20 --> 8191.76]  It's fun.
[8192.04 --> 8193.32]  It's a ludicrous game.
[8193.34 --> 8193.96]  Really fun.
[8194.08 --> 8195.04]  I love it.
[8195.08 --> 8195.34]  It's very.
[8195.54 --> 8198.64]  It's a lot deeper than I would have expected.
[8199.70 --> 8200.62]  It's really fun.
[8200.70 --> 8201.56]  Like a lot more.
[8202.12 --> 8202.44]  Yeah.
[8203.32 --> 8204.24]  Assume the sumo stance.
[8204.34 --> 8205.20]  Yeah, but for how long?
[8205.28 --> 8206.68]  Like these aren't even that short of games.
[8206.84 --> 8207.48]  It's like three minutes.
[8208.06 --> 8208.42]  No.
[8210.80 --> 8211.16]  No.
[8212.20 --> 8212.56]  No.
[8213.32 --> 8214.00]  Let's time it.
[8214.02 --> 8214.56]  I don't think so.
[8214.58 --> 8214.84]  Okay.
[8215.02 --> 8215.74]  We can time it.
[8215.80 --> 8216.24]  We can time it.
[8216.24 --> 8217.08]  Have you done that before?
[8217.24 --> 8217.72]  Well, no.
[8217.76 --> 8218.36]  I just looked it up.
[8219.02 --> 8220.88]  Apparently, the default is three minute periods.
[8221.24 --> 8221.62]  Oh, yeah.
[8221.66 --> 8222.70]  But there's like pauses.
[8222.84 --> 8223.08]  Okay.
[8223.16 --> 8223.40]  All right.
[8223.42 --> 8223.60]  All right.
[8223.60 --> 8223.70]  All right.
[8223.70 --> 8224.04]  All right.
[8224.04 --> 8224.10]  All right.
[8224.10 --> 8225.10]  Okay.
[8226.18 --> 8226.78]  So, yeah.
[8226.78 --> 8227.44]  Let's get into this.
[8227.64 --> 8230.54]  There's also one person has to score at the end.
[8231.30 --> 8231.54]  Oh, yeah.
[8231.56 --> 8232.18]  The final puck.
[8232.48 --> 8232.70]  Yeah.
[8232.84 --> 8233.00]  Yeah.
[8233.12 --> 8234.62]  That can last for a long time.
[8234.68 --> 8235.04]  That's true.
[8235.18 --> 8235.60]  That's true.
[8236.26 --> 8236.66]  That's true.
[8237.14 --> 8237.54]  Anyways.
[8237.74 --> 8238.62]  We got a lot of potential.
[8238.90 --> 8242.98]  So, I'm just going to get right into the curated with some horrible ones.
[8243.90 --> 8244.82]  Pool updates.
[8246.06 --> 8247.30]  Oh, we talked about that, didn't we?
[8247.88 --> 8248.56]  No, we didn't.
[8248.62 --> 8249.12]  You and I did.
[8249.12 --> 8250.56]  We weren't live?
[8250.78 --> 8251.20]  Hold on.
[8251.36 --> 8251.68]  Hold on.
[8251.76 --> 8253.60]  No, you're having a friendly chat.
[8253.60 --> 8253.96]  Yeah.
[8253.96 --> 8254.22]  Ah.
[8255.42 --> 8256.68]  Can't tell the difference sometimes.
[8257.86 --> 8259.74]  Basically, just blurs into one continuum.
[8261.42 --> 8262.00]  Hold on.
[8262.06 --> 8262.34]  Hold on.
[8262.40 --> 8262.70]  Hold on.
[8262.88 --> 8268.24]  Dan, do you want to flip over to my thing or my doodle?
[8268.26 --> 8268.66]  Not right now.
[8269.50 --> 8270.06]  Hold on.
[8270.20 --> 8271.98]  Just can you relax for a second?
[8272.36 --> 8273.20]  No, not really.
[8273.34 --> 8274.78]  Not when you're talking about sharing your screen.
[8275.78 --> 8276.18]  Okay.
[8276.44 --> 8276.76]  All right.
[8276.76 --> 8278.60]  There's specifically a point in time I cannot relax.
[8278.74 --> 8279.02]  Okay.
[8279.14 --> 8279.58]  All right.
[8281.02 --> 8281.42]  Oh.
[8281.42 --> 8284.16]  Oh, I see what you want.
[8284.24 --> 8284.52]  Camera.
[8284.76 --> 8285.32]  Line a scan.
[8285.70 --> 8286.18]  There we go.
[8286.28 --> 8286.58]  Oh, yeah.
[8286.60 --> 8287.20]  I could have done that.
[8287.96 --> 8292.52]  So, theoretically, it is full of water.
[8293.56 --> 8296.36]  There is still plenty of time for things to be screwed up.
[8296.36 --> 8304.70]  But I will say, to their credit, since I called them out on social media, they have had a fire under their butt and have actually done work.
[8305.06 --> 8306.76]  Oh, this is the original contractors?
[8306.90 --> 8307.02]  Yeah.
[8307.28 --> 8307.62]  Oh.
[8307.62 --> 8311.06]  There's still time for it to be screwed up.
[8311.90 --> 8313.52]  Like it sort of potentially already is.
[8313.52 --> 8313.76]  Yeah.
[8313.86 --> 8316.54]  I had already talked to Luke about how Yvonne specified.
[8317.42 --> 8321.30]  And I, look, I have to, I have to.
[8321.36 --> 8322.50]  It's still incorrect.
[8323.36 --> 8324.86]  It's a first world problem.
[8325.16 --> 8326.08]  It is still incorrect.
[8326.18 --> 8328.86]  Yvonne specified that she would like the water to be cool blue.
[8329.36 --> 8330.52]  That is green.
[8331.30 --> 8334.40]  You might need to explain how that makes any sense at all.
[8334.40 --> 8339.90]  So, the plaster that they line it with has flecks that are supposed to reflect and color the water.
[8341.56 --> 8349.90]  And it is not the color that she specified, which means it doesn't match the tile.
[8350.22 --> 8351.36]  Eggshell rant V2.
[8351.44 --> 8355.42]  So, it just honestly looks kind of stupid.
[8360.18 --> 8361.12]  But, like.
[8361.36 --> 8362.00]  Got him.
[8362.00 --> 8366.84]  At this point, I think I'd take basically anything.
[8370.04 --> 8370.74]  Oh, boy.
[8371.10 --> 8371.40]  Yeah.
[8371.50 --> 8375.16]  So, there's just been, you know, one thing after another with it.
[8375.26 --> 8379.10]  But, and there's still time for the equipment to like not work properly.
[8379.20 --> 8379.52]  I don't know.
[8379.68 --> 8384.30]  And it's possible that this is just from shmoo in the water from the plaster.
[8384.52 --> 8386.20]  Like they just plastered it and polished it.
[8386.26 --> 8387.12]  So, maybe it's like.
[8387.22 --> 8387.46]  Yeah.
[8387.70 --> 8389.18]  Maybe it's shmooed or something.
[8389.28 --> 8389.56]  Potentially.
[8389.88 --> 8390.70]  I don't think so.
[8391.20 --> 8392.70]  That's a lot of water in there now.
[8393.86 --> 8395.40]  How long was it sitting before they filled it?
[8395.40 --> 8396.36]  There can't be that much shmoo.
[8396.84 --> 8397.44]  It wasn't.
[8398.36 --> 8398.52]  Oh.
[8398.62 --> 8399.64]  They polished it and then filled it.
[8400.02 --> 8400.34]  Oh.
[8400.54 --> 8400.76]  Like, yeah.
[8400.84 --> 8401.12]  No, no.
[8401.82 --> 8402.14]  Yeah.
[8402.24 --> 8402.76]  No, no.
[8403.24 --> 8403.50]  No.
[8403.58 --> 8405.14]  It's green.
[8405.58 --> 8406.66]  So, that's cool.
[8408.60 --> 8408.96]  Yeah.
[8409.00 --> 8411.38]  It's just frustrating because, yes.
[8411.62 --> 8412.26]  First world problem.
[8412.40 --> 8413.26]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[8413.30 --> 8413.44]  Yes.
[8413.44 --> 8416.00]  But on the other hand, they asked us what color we wanted.
[8417.36 --> 8418.54]  So, don't ask if.
[8419.22 --> 8419.50]  Yeah.
[8420.44 --> 8421.54]  You're not going to do it.
[8423.90 --> 8425.48]  Someone's like, I would ask them to change it.
[8425.54 --> 8426.74]  No, we're not doing that.
[8427.28 --> 8429.16]  They would have to like, what?
[8429.28 --> 8431.84]  Like jackhammer out the previous plaster?
[8432.00 --> 8432.48]  Like, it's not.
[8432.62 --> 8433.50]  Could you just do another layer?
[8433.70 --> 8434.84]  I freaking, I don't know.
[8435.04 --> 8436.02]  We're not doing that.
[8436.02 --> 8438.22]  So, that's the color that it is now.
[8438.62 --> 8443.34]  And I wish we had a different tile color or something because they really don't match at all.
[8443.42 --> 8444.48]  But, yeah, it is what it is.
[8444.90 --> 8448.24]  And even though it is now full of water, it's not actually full.
[8448.32 --> 8449.48]  It's filling right now.
[8449.74 --> 8458.24]  Even though it's filling with water right now, it's still going to be a month before we can swim, I think.
[8458.24 --> 8466.26]  Like, Linus is pissed at the minimum viable product and people are surprised.
[8466.44 --> 8467.18]  Well, that's not.
[8467.32 --> 8468.40]  It's like incorrect.
[8469.22 --> 8469.44]  Yeah.
[8469.46 --> 8476.54]  If someone asks you what color shirt you want and you say green and they say okay and then they send you a red one.
[8476.76 --> 8477.72]  Here's a plain blue shirt.
[8477.84 --> 8478.08]  Yeah.
[8478.08 --> 8479.64]  You're going to be like, hold on a minute.
[8479.64 --> 8480.10]  Well, what the fuck?
[8480.20 --> 8482.10]  This isn't what I paid for.
[8482.38 --> 8482.68]  Like, it's.
[8482.76 --> 8482.82]  Yeah.
[8482.82 --> 8483.66]  Like, you have a shirt.
[8483.88 --> 8484.64]  He has a pool.
[8485.36 --> 8486.80]  The pool is the wrong color.
[8486.90 --> 8487.76]  The shirt is the wrong color.
[8487.76 --> 8488.28]  Like, is that.
[8488.42 --> 8490.08]  Like, that's stupid.
[8490.40 --> 8490.58]  Yeah.
[8490.98 --> 8496.02]  If you weren't able to control the color of it, why'd you ask me then?
[8496.10 --> 8496.28]  Yeah.
[8496.64 --> 8497.10]  Like, it's.
[8498.38 --> 8502.18]  Guys, why are you trying to be dumb?
[8502.48 --> 8503.22]  Oh, he's saying.
[8503.44 --> 8504.48]  I don't really understand.
[8504.68 --> 8505.18]  It's fine.
[8505.32 --> 8505.82]  It's okay.
[8506.04 --> 8506.40]  Whatever.
[8506.72 --> 8507.30]  Pool wrong.
[8507.56 --> 8508.08]  Moving on.
[8508.16 --> 8508.58]  Next message.
[8508.58 --> 8510.86]  The real question is can we land a float plane in it?
[8511.86 --> 8512.62]  I mean, yeah.
[8512.62 --> 8514.14]  Courtesy of Legendary Rust here.
[8514.34 --> 8514.80]  We could.
[8514.96 --> 8515.64]  The model won.
[8515.64 --> 8517.98]  Yeah.
[8518.26 --> 8518.50]  Yeah.
[8518.68 --> 8519.54]  They, like, actually could.
[8519.68 --> 8520.10]  Oh, man.
[8520.10 --> 8520.90]  Do a model float plane.
[8521.22 --> 8523.28]  Man, that's a product that I wanted to do.
[8523.32 --> 8524.50]  Not a float plane.
[8524.64 --> 8530.10]  That's a product that I wanted to do, like, a long time ago when my kids were little.
[8530.10 --> 8533.70]  And they still, like, took baths together and stuff like that.
[8533.72 --> 8540.80]  And I was like, man, how cool would it be to do, like, an RC boat, but that's, like,
[8541.12 --> 8542.76]  I don't know, three inches long.
[8543.52 --> 8547.66]  And that has, like, a water-resistant remote that you can just, like, rip around in the tub.
[8547.70 --> 8548.68]  And I know they exist.
[8549.22 --> 8550.02]  But, like, a good one.
[8550.02 --> 8550.48]  A good one.
[8550.62 --> 8550.74]  Yeah.
[8550.84 --> 8552.22]  You know, one that is actually good.
[8552.60 --> 8556.40]  Man, how cool would it be to just have, like, little six-inch boats that you can, like,
[8556.44 --> 8557.16]  rip around in the pool?
[8557.16 --> 8558.20]  I'd be so into that.
[8559.04 --> 8559.78]  Freaking awesome.
[8561.88 --> 8563.02]  Hi, Linus and Luke.
[8563.48 --> 8566.56]  Linus, how can I start badminton if I have zero friends?
[8567.32 --> 8568.88]  Maybe at your upcoming place?
[8569.46 --> 8573.66]  And, Luke, when you started badminton, what was the hardest thing you had to get used to?
[8574.00 --> 8574.42]  You first.
[8575.94 --> 8579.50]  The hardest thing he had to get used to was sucking so much.
[8579.90 --> 8580.26]  Wow.
[8580.46 --> 8584.96]  Compared to someone who is obviously so much weaker and lower testosterone.
[8585.54 --> 8585.88]  Wow.
[8585.88 --> 8589.72]  Because he sucks compared to me.
[8591.10 --> 8592.56]  Like, so much ass.
[8595.38 --> 8597.24]  And, Linus, how about, uh...
[8597.24 --> 8598.72]  That's why I have to clean out his mouth.
[8600.10 --> 8601.76]  Let's get the ass taste out.
[8604.80 --> 8605.54]  Couldn't get him.
[8605.72 --> 8606.56]  So close.
[8606.56 --> 8612.02]  I had to, like, hold the water in the front so I could breathe behind it.
[8614.56 --> 8616.86]  I'm lucky I didn't have too much.
[8619.86 --> 8622.74]  I'm gonna get water all over the front of that laptop one day.
[8622.90 --> 8623.94]  You marked my words.
[8625.08 --> 8625.78]  Not yet.
[8625.78 --> 8627.52]  Oh, my goodness.
[8627.76 --> 8628.16]  Sorry.
[8628.40 --> 8632.50]  The question for me, how to get into it with zero friends, is really tough.
[8632.74 --> 8636.04]  Especially because most of the centers don't do drop-in anymore these days.
[8636.12 --> 8637.14]  Not since the COVID shutdowns.
[8638.40 --> 8642.18]  Also, when you go play drop-in as a novice, it's really hard to get people to play with you.
[8642.18 --> 8649.44]  I found that more casual groups tend to show up at, like, school gyms and church gyms.
[8649.62 --> 8653.78]  I have no idea how to find them, though.
[8653.86 --> 8657.66]  I know in Taiwan, I'll just, like, go on Meetup.
[8657.66 --> 8662.28]  And then once you get into, like, one group, you find someone who's kind of at your level,
[8662.34 --> 8664.66]  and then you, like, network through them.
[8664.78 --> 8666.14]  That's kind of the best way to do it.
[8667.90 --> 8670.70]  But, yeah, our place will have drop-in sessions.
[8670.94 --> 8674.82]  But, like, again, there's nothing we're gonna be able to do to force people to play with you.
[8674.90 --> 8676.82]  And if you're a complete novice...
[8676.82 --> 8679.32]  You have to be social and ask people to play.
[8679.46 --> 8680.04]  Yeah, it's tough.
[8681.14 --> 8684.72]  For me, it was a lot of the movement is very unnatural to me.
[8684.72 --> 8690.84]  There's certain, like, stances and things you do with movement,
[8690.92 --> 8693.78]  where in contact sports, it's like a big no-no,
[8694.18 --> 8698.80]  because you're putting yourself in a fairly unstable position
[8698.80 --> 8703.10]  if someone was to become in contact with you at that point in time, if that makes sense.
[8703.28 --> 8704.86]  It's not necessarily super unstable.
[8705.24 --> 8707.46]  But if an outside force, like, pushed you, you'd fall over.
[8708.42 --> 8711.76]  So things like that, my brain is, like, telling me,
[8711.80 --> 8713.20]  no, no, no, no, no, don't do this.
[8713.20 --> 8715.36]  But then everyone watching me is like,
[8715.48 --> 8717.42]  okay, the way you're moving sucks and is dumb,
[8717.68 --> 8718.98]  and you need to do this other way.
[8719.74 --> 8723.02]  Also, like, hitting the birdies,
[8723.64 --> 8725.58]  my brain wants to, like, club them.
[8727.04 --> 8730.30]  And you're supposed to do this, like, wrist turn thing more,
[8730.64 --> 8731.32]  and stuff like that.
[8731.38 --> 8732.92]  Like, a lot of it just doesn't really...
[8732.92 --> 8735.10]  A lot of sports come fairly naturally to me,
[8735.14 --> 8737.44]  and badminton does not come very naturally to me.
[8737.98 --> 8738.10]  Yeah.
[8739.70 --> 8741.56]  Okay, this one might get a bit spicy.
[8741.56 --> 8742.74]  Oh, Lord.
[8743.12 --> 8747.68]  Do you agree with Louis Rossman's take that Google is going to war with ad blockers?
[8747.78 --> 8752.42]  Is nickel and diming and a sign of YouTube being on the verge of monetary collapse?
[8752.42 --> 8762.56]  I mean, I don't think it's a particularly hot take that YouTube is in a position where they obviously need to do something to make the platform viable.
[8762.70 --> 8768.48]  I mean, that's the entire argument that I made in that video that YouTube should charge for 4K,
[8768.48 --> 8773.04]  is that the 4K users are by far the heaviest users.
[8773.70 --> 8779.10]  They are, like, in terms of, like, placing load on the platform,
[8779.84 --> 8783.38]  and they, at that point, should be...
[8783.38 --> 8785.24]  They're also the most discerning users,
[8785.36 --> 8790.04]  and the ones that should be most willing to pay for the storage,
[8790.04 --> 8794.60]  and especially the bandwidth costs associated with high-resolution video.
[8795.50 --> 8803.40]  I don't consider it to be nickel and diming to expect people to compensate the platform and the creators
[8803.40 --> 8804.74]  for the content that they consume.
[8804.82 --> 8806.30]  No, not really, actually.
[8806.30 --> 8814.00]  So that's the one part where, yeah, I don't know that I can necessarily agree with Lewis 100%,
[8814.00 --> 8818.34]  but I definitely do agree that it's clear they need to do something to remain viable,
[8818.34 --> 8823.12]  because neither Luke nor I has been able to figure out for all these years how any of this makes any sense.
[8823.62 --> 8826.20]  And at some point, things have to make sense,
[8826.24 --> 8828.18]  and if they don't make sense, then they go away.
[8828.36 --> 8829.34]  See Jiffy Cat.
[8830.92 --> 8832.28]  See Twitter, right?
[8832.28 --> 8836.72]  Like, if it's not sustainable, then it won't be sustained.
[8837.06 --> 8837.42]  Eventually.
[8837.74 --> 8839.40]  By definition, yeah, exactly.
[8840.94 --> 8844.06]  And so, I don't know.
[8844.20 --> 8850.68]  Would we say that theaters are nickel and diming because they prevent people from sneaking in?
[8850.74 --> 8852.38]  I mean, nobody was going to sit in those seats anyway.
[8852.58 --> 8854.94]  Like, often that's the argument for ad blockers,
[8854.98 --> 8858.46]  is I wasn't going to pay for premium, and I wasn't going to watch that,
[8858.52 --> 8859.76]  or I wasn't going to buy anything anyway.
[8859.76 --> 8864.34]  And it's like, okay, but, like, that's the...
[8864.34 --> 8865.88]  You're taxing this service.
[8866.14 --> 8867.36]  Yeah, that's the price of admission.
[8867.44 --> 8869.16]  It costs money to give this to you.
[8869.52 --> 8872.02]  I mean, in the case of the theater, actually, like,
[8872.10 --> 8874.28]  there's a marginal cost.
[8874.98 --> 8880.12]  Your HVAC has to work ever so slightly harder to account for your approximately 100 watts of heat.
[8880.62 --> 8883.42]  And they might have to clean up after you if you make a mess.
[8883.90 --> 8884.54]  The average...
[8884.54 --> 8885.38]  Technically wearing the chairs.
[8885.66 --> 8886.16]  That's true.
[8886.40 --> 8886.84]  That's true.
[8886.84 --> 8889.50]  Those chairs are actually very surprisingly expensive.
[8889.76 --> 8893.10]  There's also opportunity costs.
[8893.50 --> 8894.28]  Linus is wrong.
[8894.40 --> 8896.92]  4K was a free option, then YouTube wanted to charge for it.
[8896.96 --> 8899.04]  You can't charge for something that was free previously.
[8899.14 --> 8900.80]  Well, you absolutely can.
[8902.74 --> 8904.86]  Unquestionably, you can absolutely do that.
[8905.32 --> 8905.64]  Wow.
[8906.60 --> 8907.00]  Wow.
[8909.56 --> 8909.96]  Wow.
[8909.96 --> 8910.16]  Wow.
[8910.16 --> 8915.68]  I don't know how else to...
[8915.68 --> 8917.52]  The community might not like it.
[8917.74 --> 8922.50]  You will pretty much always get negative sentiment in response to that.
[8922.74 --> 8923.20]  Shrekt.
[8923.20 --> 8925.76]  You super definitely can do that.
[8928.10 --> 8929.32]  Hey, DLL.
[8929.78 --> 8933.94]  I've always wondered how much creative influence the editors have over videos.
[8934.34 --> 8936.82]  Is there an editing Bible that you try to follow?
[8937.38 --> 8938.16]  Thanks for all you do.
[8938.36 --> 8940.48]  If there is, I haven't seen it in a long time.
[8940.92 --> 8944.14]  I think Ed probably has some guidelines and stuff.
[8944.20 --> 8946.42]  There's definitely rules that we have overall.
[8946.96 --> 8951.78]  I mean, it's not necessarily the editors, but I had to remind people recently of our policy
[8951.78 --> 8953.00]  for gross out content.
[8953.58 --> 8955.20]  And I had to clarify it a little bit.
[8955.26 --> 8958.00]  We had a video recently that had someone flossing their teeth in it.
[8958.00 --> 8962.46]  And I was like, hey, can I just remind you of the no gross out policy?
[8962.46 --> 8964.06]  Because I saw some comments about it.
[8964.38 --> 8969.22]  Ever since we did that channel super fun video where people were eating without their hands
[8969.22 --> 8974.32]  like SpaghettiOs off of a piece of plexiglass that had a camera under it, we basically...
[8974.32 --> 8976.58]  We thought it was kind of funny and it would look ridiculous.
[8976.70 --> 8978.50]  And it was kind of funny and it did look ridiculous.
[8978.50 --> 8980.14]  But it was unsettling.
[8980.68 --> 8986.24]  And if you get even 3% of people who tune into a video immediately navigating away when something
[8986.24 --> 8989.72]  grosses them out, that's going to hurt your channel's recommendation.
[8990.28 --> 8991.36]  Disgust is a powerful emotion.
[8991.36 --> 8992.64]  Yeah, your recommendability.
[8993.16 --> 8998.16]  And so I sent out a little memo being like, hey, no, remember?
[8998.56 --> 9002.60]  And I got a bit of pushback from people saying, well, where's the line?
[9002.72 --> 9005.98]  You know, what grosses out one person doesn't necessarily gross out another.
[9005.98 --> 9008.28]  And so I kind of had to think of something.
[9008.40 --> 9013.68]  And I basically said, look, if it would be considered rude in mixed company at the dinner
[9013.68 --> 9015.16]  table, then it doesn't go in the video.
[9015.16 --> 9017.04]  And so that's kind of our...
[9017.04 --> 9019.10]  That's our current line on it.
[9020.78 --> 9027.64]  So any, you know, biting fingernails, flossing teeth, you know, just basically anything where
[9027.64 --> 9030.68]  a body fluid is involved is probably over the line.
[9031.32 --> 9032.70]  So there's things like that.
[9033.34 --> 9039.20]  You know, there's definitely guidelines we have in terms of we never like to see just,
[9039.20 --> 9047.66]  you know, jump cuts, you know, just like crappy, you know, 2010 era YouTube editing, where you
[9047.66 --> 9053.08]  just like take out every tiny gap and the host is just constantly jump cutting.
[9053.50 --> 9055.06]  I've never liked that style.
[9055.20 --> 9060.02]  So that is always supposed to be covered with B-roll or with a website capture, just anything,
[9060.38 --> 9061.60]  anything to mask a cut.
[9061.60 --> 9064.36]  So there's things like that.
[9064.50 --> 9069.56]  But in terms of like the content itself, I mean, that's mostly between the writing team,
[9069.90 --> 9072.22]  me, and then the editor adds their special flair.
[9072.34 --> 9077.92]  And then it gets like a final review from someone up high, usually Nick Light.
[9078.06 --> 9079.52]  I think Colton's been doing some of them.
[9080.02 --> 9083.24]  Theoretically, I should be doing them, but I never get to it.
[9083.34 --> 9086.14]  I'm just doing so much stuff.
[9086.52 --> 9087.06]  Quick question.
[9087.06 --> 9090.50]  All the LTX LAN computers are brought by people, right?
[9090.56 --> 9091.50]  We're not providing any?
[9092.24 --> 9093.16]  As far as I know.
[9093.36 --> 9093.80]  Yeah, cool.
[9093.94 --> 9094.10]  Yeah.
[9094.28 --> 9094.90]  That answers the question.
[9095.28 --> 9097.86]  Aggie says, biting fingernails is not gross out, lol.
[9100.72 --> 9102.20]  To a lot of people it is.
[9102.22 --> 9105.50]  It would be considered rude at a dinner table with mixed company.
[9105.60 --> 9105.76]  Yeah.
[9105.84 --> 9106.48]  So then it is.
[9106.74 --> 9107.68]  That's the line.
[9110.02 --> 9111.00]  People are replying.
[9111.56 --> 9113.58]  I bite bad and I know I'm gross.
[9114.90 --> 9116.10]  Way to go, Bordaga.
[9117.06 --> 9121.20]  Okay, moving on.
[9121.58 --> 9123.72]  Hey, DLL, but mostly little L.
[9124.08 --> 9128.64]  In the Framework Factory Tour, you mentioned that they assemble the DIY kits to test them.
[9128.98 --> 9131.90]  If they assemble them, how and why are they cheaper?
[9132.26 --> 9133.70]  Also, big and tall sizes win.
[9134.12 --> 9138.50]  I didn't want to say this incorrectly, but I'm pretty sure it's because the DIY editions come...
[9138.50 --> 9140.90]  The lowest tier comes without stuff, right?
[9141.02 --> 9141.18]  Yeah.
[9141.34 --> 9142.42]  No memory, no storage.
[9142.42 --> 9142.74]  Yeah.
[9142.80 --> 9146.42]  So then you can save a buck if you can get a good deal on some memory and storage somewhere else.
[9146.42 --> 9147.38]  Or if you already have some.
[9147.40 --> 9148.62]  So that's really the main benefit.
[9148.70 --> 9151.56]  As for big and tall sizes, man, they're working on it.
[9152.18 --> 9159.02]  One of our fit technicians who's been off for a while is back now, so hopefully we'll have a little bit more resources to dedicate to that.
[9159.40 --> 9161.04]  We get questions about this every week.
[9161.48 --> 9166.12]  I promise you, when they happen, we will let you know on WAN Show and I will be wearing one.
[9166.12 --> 9170.58]  I am very excited about that.
[9170.70 --> 9170.84]  Yeah.
[9170.90 --> 9173.78]  It'll just be tall by then, but he's going to do it.
[9174.02 --> 9174.28]  Yeah.
[9174.52 --> 9175.04]  Hell yeah.
[9177.04 --> 9177.68]  Hi, LLD.
[9177.94 --> 9180.02]  We'll be listening on Spotify on Monday.
[9180.54 --> 9185.84]  Has there ever been a time you've been tempted to stray away from the prosumer mindset LMG is known for?
[9186.44 --> 9187.46]  Pro-consumer mindset.
[9187.80 --> 9188.42]  Come on, Dan.
[9188.66 --> 9189.96]  That's a very different word.
[9190.34 --> 9190.60]  Oh.
[9191.30 --> 9192.22]  Pro-consumer.
[9192.22 --> 9194.00]  I mean, yeah, sure.
[9195.02 --> 9210.14]  Like, I think any business that looked you in the eye or any business owner that looked you in the eye and said, I have never once been tempted to make more money in a way that benefits me selfishly.
[9211.72 --> 9217.12]  Either is like some kind of saint or is not being honest with you.
[9217.76 --> 9219.44]  Like, remember when we.
[9219.64 --> 9220.84]  I think just not being honest.
[9220.84 --> 9227.00]  When we would talk about LLTT coin or like a run pull coin or like all that kind of stuff.
[9227.18 --> 9230.44]  Like it's, you know, how, yeah.
[9230.54 --> 9231.92]  How, how cool would it been?
[9232.00 --> 9237.56]  Would it have been to just like make $10 million by just minting it?
[9237.80 --> 9238.96]  Farting out some garbage.
[9239.22 --> 9239.48]  Yeah.
[9239.48 --> 9241.92]  And we even like, we talked about it.
[9241.94 --> 9244.44]  We were like, we talked about it publicly on WAN show.
[9244.52 --> 9247.00]  So none of this is a secret, but we, we talked about it.
[9247.04 --> 9251.42]  We said like, oh man, we could even just be, we could even just be totally upfront about it.
[9251.60 --> 9252.94]  Guys, this is a rug pull.
[9252.94 --> 9257.16]  So if, if you're not in, if you're not on it.
[9257.16 --> 9257.96]  If you time it right.
[9258.06 --> 9258.22]  Yeah.
[9258.28 --> 9258.50]  Right.
[9258.52 --> 9260.40]  When the rug gets pulled, you're good.
[9260.48 --> 9262.20]  It's, you're going to be the one on your butt.
[9262.20 --> 9269.02]  And you know, this is our cynical, you know, money fabrication, um, endeavor.
[9269.28 --> 9270.30]  So let's go.
[9270.44 --> 9270.64]  Woo.
[9271.06 --> 9273.16]  Like we, we just decided not to.
[9273.16 --> 9274.72]  And we were just like, kind of gross.
[9275.70 --> 9276.78]  Ah, fine.
[9277.04 --> 9281.08]  I guess we just want, I mean, NFTs were another example of just a way that we could have made
[9281.08 --> 9281.80]  some easy money.
[9282.28 --> 9286.94]  Um, instead we did still make some easy money, but not nearly as much.
[9286.94 --> 9288.86]  And we did it by just mocking NFTs.
[9289.30 --> 9291.00]  Um, we just sold pictures of potatoes.
[9291.00 --> 9294.16]  We actually sold like $8,000 worth of pictures of potatoes.
[9294.36 --> 9296.04]  It's kind of, it's kind of obscene.
[9296.16 --> 9296.60]  Let's go.
[9296.98 --> 9301.20]  Um, hey, I'm sure there's people who printed out their potato and put it on their wall.
[9301.34 --> 9302.56]  Dude, some of them, okay.
[9302.96 --> 9304.74]  Some of them were legitimately kind of cool.
[9305.38 --> 9311.16]  The people that those potatoes, okay, were minted on, you know, LMG dime.
[9311.46 --> 9314.36]  And I say dime, you know, sort of.
[9315.02 --> 9315.78]  Fairly accurately.
[9315.78 --> 9317.64]  It was about $22 if I remember correctly.
[9317.84 --> 9318.22]  Yeah.
[9318.44 --> 9319.08]  Something like that.
[9319.10 --> 9319.24]  Yeah.
[9319.30 --> 9319.72]  To generate.
[9319.72 --> 9321.36]  Uh, that might've actually been something else.
[9321.76 --> 9322.48]  I don't remember.
[9322.56 --> 9323.76]  It wasn't, it wasn't very much.
[9323.76 --> 9323.94]  It was extremely low.
[9324.00 --> 9324.14]  Yeah.
[9324.38 --> 9324.56]  Yeah.
[9325.34 --> 9327.94]  If I remember correctly, there's a free amount that they give you.
[9328.04 --> 9331.18]  I think it's like 20 bucks allowance before it starts costing you money.
[9332.04 --> 9332.64]  Oh, wait.
[9332.76 --> 9333.08]  Yeah.
[9333.70 --> 9335.18]  No, the 22 was for something else.
[9335.22 --> 9337.24]  I'm pretty sure we didn't even breach the free allowance.
[9337.34 --> 9339.62]  I think it costs us like nothing, but I don't, I don't really remember.
[9339.62 --> 9344.42]  Ghost Robles on Twitch says integrity is much more worth than $10 million.
[9345.70 --> 9347.28]  You would be surprised.
[9348.52 --> 9350.80]  You'd be surprised how many people.
[9351.00 --> 9354.26]  There is a massive amount of people that would disagree with that.
[9354.26 --> 9357.30]  There's a massive amount of people that would agree with that.
[9357.30 --> 9363.56]  And then given the actual real opportunity in front of them, actually in real life would
[9363.56 --> 9364.30]  go the other way.
[9365.14 --> 9367.90]  $10 million is a lot of money.
[9367.90 --> 9374.50]  Like there is a, there is a, changes the life of you and everyone, you know, amount of money.
[9374.56 --> 9374.82]  Oh yeah.
[9374.82 --> 9375.38]  It's crazy.
[9375.54 --> 9375.76]  Yeah.
[9376.18 --> 9383.60]  There, there is a very disappointingly large percentage of people that will verbally stand
[9383.60 --> 9384.42]  behind ideas.
[9384.42 --> 9389.40]  And then the second, even a single dollar comes into question, they will immediately crumple
[9389.40 --> 9390.02]  those ideas.
[9390.14 --> 9392.92]  Like just, yeah.
[9393.34 --> 9395.06]  Anyways, we should probably move on.
[9395.06 --> 9399.46]  Will there be any plans to make float plane merch like Luke has?
[9399.76 --> 9402.40]  Also, when are the tech pants going on the store?
[9402.70 --> 9403.60]  You can't take my shirt.
[9404.02 --> 9407.10]  Uh, yes, we have a blue blank.
[9408.04 --> 9411.38]  It's a very dissimilar color to that one, but it's blue.
[9411.56 --> 9411.62]  Oh.
[9412.40 --> 9417.54]  Um, float plane, it turns out, doesn't have a Pantone for its blue.
[9418.00 --> 9418.44]  Oh.
[9418.56 --> 9419.44]  So that's inconvenient.
[9419.92 --> 9420.20]  Ah.
[9420.96 --> 9421.24]  Yeah.
[9421.54 --> 9424.84]  So the design team, you know, put some blues in front of me.
[9424.84 --> 9426.28]  And I was like, that doesn't really seem like float plane.
[9426.32 --> 9427.44]  And they're like, well, it's not.
[9427.90 --> 9428.72]  And I was like, what do you mean?
[9428.92 --> 9429.76]  Well, it doesn't have one.
[9429.84 --> 9430.40]  And I was like, what do you mean?
[9430.42 --> 9431.06]  It doesn't have one.
[9431.10 --> 9431.74]  What about that one?
[9431.78 --> 9434.84]  They're like, yeah, that's not like a real color.
[9434.94 --> 9436.54]  That's just, yeah.
[9436.68 --> 9440.42]  So anyway, um, we're working on it.
[9440.58 --> 9440.80]  Sweet.
[9440.98 --> 9442.12]  This is pretty close.
[9442.24 --> 9443.08]  How did they do this?
[9443.56 --> 9444.60]  That's from American Apparel.
[9444.60 --> 9447.98]  So they can't print colors that aren't Pantone?
[9447.98 --> 9448.98]  No, no, it's the base.
[9450.64 --> 9451.94]  Like the actual shirt.
[9452.18 --> 9452.60]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9452.62 --> 9454.56]  They can't create a shirt that isn't Pantone?
[9455.02 --> 9457.42]  Well, it's a melange.
[9457.42 --> 9458.78]  I don't know how any of this stuff works.
[9458.78 --> 9459.38]  Yeah, no, no.
[9459.52 --> 9459.78]  Okay.
[9460.00 --> 9460.46]  Yeah, no.
[9460.76 --> 9461.02]  All right.
[9461.02 --> 9465.20]  So like there's a, there's a reason people use Pantone because it allows you to communicate
[9465.20 --> 9468.78]  color across devices, across oceans.
[9469.38 --> 9473.98]  Um, and like we could send them that shirt and be like, make this, but they actually wouldn't
[9473.98 --> 9476.82]  be able to do that particularly because this is a melange.
[9476.94 --> 9478.24]  So first they dye the blue.
[9478.34 --> 9478.94]  What does that mean?
[9479.20 --> 9481.46]  It means it's got blue and white fabric in it.
[9481.62 --> 9482.58]  Look, look closely.
[9482.70 --> 9484.30]  Oh my God, your eyesight is so bad.
[9484.92 --> 9487.66]  You never noticed that's not like a uniform color.
[9488.62 --> 9490.28]  I honestly thought that was just the pilling.
[9491.02 --> 9492.58]  Cause it's really old.
[9494.78 --> 9496.10]  I also don't really care.
[9496.42 --> 9496.68]  Okay.
[9496.76 --> 9502.14]  Well, anyway, there's two different colors that are, um, I'm going to get this wrong.
[9502.22 --> 9506.74]  It's either woven or something, but they're put together.
[9506.74 --> 9514.26]  And so what you see is partially some, partially other as they, you know, weave in back and forth
[9514.26 --> 9516.96]  replicating that exact look.
[9516.96 --> 9522.36]  Very difficult without knowing exactly what weave and exactly what colors and ratios and
[9522.36 --> 9523.22]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[9523.30 --> 9527.34]  So no, we have to basically do our own shirt and it's, um, yeah, it's a lot lighter.
[9527.44 --> 9528.30]  Like it's fine.
[9528.30 --> 9530.98]  And that, Jayden revealed the fun secret.
[9531.58 --> 9532.12]  Oh, what's this?
[9532.22 --> 9534.00]  The shirt isn't one of the full plane colors either.
[9534.32 --> 9534.52]  Yeah.
[9534.74 --> 9534.94]  Yeah.
[9534.96 --> 9536.00]  No, because there isn't one.
[9536.80 --> 9537.84]  So yeah.
[9538.28 --> 9539.26]  It is a color.
[9539.38 --> 9541.54]  That was just an American apparel shirt that we picked.
[9541.64 --> 9541.98]  Like it.
[9542.18 --> 9542.36]  Yeah.
[9542.36 --> 9546.42]  It was whatever they had in stock because they never had anything.
[9549.10 --> 9549.30]  Hey.
[9549.42 --> 9551.44]  L plus ratio plus not a real panto.
[9554.44 --> 9554.84]  Sorry.
[9554.94 --> 9555.88]  That was, that was good.
[9555.98 --> 9558.24]  That's a dev in the dev in full point chat.
[9558.42 --> 9558.66]  Sorry.
[9558.72 --> 9559.42]  Go for it.
[9559.62 --> 9560.38]  No, it's great.
[9560.82 --> 9562.52]  Hey, DLL for lime.
[9562.90 --> 9563.46]  How's that?
[9563.64 --> 9565.76]  How's that not the best name ever for a developer?
[9565.76 --> 9566.42]  Dev in the dev.
[9566.56 --> 9566.74]  Yeah.
[9566.86 --> 9569.20]  Like, uh, Hey, what are you up to?
[9569.24 --> 9569.78]  I'm just Devin.
[9569.78 --> 9577.26]  My best friend when I was growing up was named Devin and he's currently a dev.
[9577.46 --> 9577.76]  Nice.
[9577.86 --> 9579.40]  And I used to call him dev growing up.
[9579.68 --> 9580.22]  So nice.
[9580.44 --> 9580.66]  Yeah.
[9580.74 --> 9581.22]  Dev the dev.
[9581.60 --> 9582.34]  It's all your fault.
[9582.70 --> 9582.90]  Yep.
[9583.86 --> 9585.36]  Hey, DLL for lime day.
[9585.44 --> 9588.12]  Would we be able to pick up our order at LTX?
[9588.68 --> 9589.28]  No, no.
[9591.56 --> 9593.04]  It sounds really complicated.
[9593.04 --> 9594.64]  It does.
[9594.64 --> 9600.52]  Is Microsoft projects Volterra worth buying yet?
[9600.72 --> 9608.08]  Or are there still no good consumer options for arm desktops outside of the Mac bubble?
[9608.56 --> 9611.68]  I'm an open source developer and I want to start porting.
[9611.68 --> 9619.38]  I haven't played around with, uh, project Volterra.
[9621.58 --> 9623.10]  It appears to be a dev kit.
[9623.50 --> 9630.44]  So I would say no, if it's a dev kit, they're literally telling you that it is not for you to buy.
[9630.44 --> 9638.36]  Um, I haven't seen any great options for arm windows PCs yet.
[9639.02 --> 9644.84]  So I'm going to go with, uh, if you want something that actually like works good, then no.
[9644.84 --> 9651.98]  Linus, as a smart home user burned by in stone, in stone.
[9652.12 --> 9654.54]  I'm not entirely sure how to pronounce that instant.
[9654.72 --> 9655.68]  It's got too many consonants.
[9655.82 --> 9656.14]  Insteon.
[9656.46 --> 9656.98]  Insteon.
[9657.56 --> 9658.88]  Uh, going defunct.
[9658.96 --> 9663.94]  I've recently settled on IP wifi based switches that support home kit as a replacement.
[9664.14 --> 9667.00]  How has your Z wave system issues been going?
[9667.12 --> 9668.06]  I just haven't touched it.
[9669.02 --> 9672.52]  I just accept that my house is stupid, not smart.
[9672.52 --> 9680.00]  And I will deal with it when, um, what's their face actually delivers project Linus.
[9681.70 --> 9682.62]  Hi, LLD.
[9682.84 --> 9684.16]  This question is for Luke.
[9684.72 --> 9690.10]  As we know, you're a wonderful bird dad, but does your love of birds extend to bird watching as well?
[9690.36 --> 9690.66]  In a melee.
[9691.72 --> 9693.52]  Uh, not with like intention.
[9695.04 --> 9696.50]  Like I don't go out to go bird watching.
[9696.88 --> 9701.10]  There is an app that uses AI to ID birds from their sounds.
[9701.48 --> 9702.20]  That'd be pretty cool.
[9702.20 --> 9706.16]  I did want to get a, uh, one of those little smart bird feeder things.
[9706.82 --> 9710.86]  Um, but I have wisened in my years and it was a Kickstarter.
[9711.04 --> 9716.82]  So instead of backing it, I just favorited the page and it's been like four years.
[9717.06 --> 9718.96]  And as far as I can tell, it does not exist.
[9719.36 --> 9720.80]  So dodged that one.
[9721.36 --> 9727.48]  Um, but yeah, I wanted like a bird feeder that would take a picture of the bird when it came to get some seed.
[9727.48 --> 9729.66]  And would try to ID what type of bird it was.
[9729.72 --> 9731.74]  Cause I thought that would just be interesting to see what's in the area.
[9732.14 --> 9738.38]  Uh, what I have found is I just kind of like try to make friends with random birds that I find.
[9738.38 --> 9744.20]  Like when I was in Taiwan, I was stuck at like a transit station for a while.
[9744.56 --> 9747.08]  And there was some bird there and I just like talked to it.
[9747.60 --> 9748.94]  Cause they like noise, right?
[9750.06 --> 9751.00]  So I don't know.
[9751.08 --> 9755.90]  Like if I'm coming into work and I park and I'm like walking up to the building and there's some bird there,
[9755.92 --> 9759.80]  I'll just like friendly yell at it cause they like loud noises.
[9759.88 --> 9760.56]  So I'll be like, hi bird!
[9760.56 --> 9762.50]  And they just walk by.
[9762.64 --> 9762.96]  I don't know.
[9763.20 --> 9766.96]  I noticed them more, but no, I'm not going to go out intentionally bird watching.
[9768.74 --> 9776.00]  Hey DLL, in the past you have said you didn't want to go into PC retail because the margins were thin on selling parts and computers.
[9776.68 --> 9779.48]  What changed to consider it with labs tested?
[9782.48 --> 9782.96]  Oh.
[9782.96 --> 9795.80]  I am considering it just because I'm considering it doesn't mean that it is likely to ever happen.
[9796.88 --> 9805.12]  Um, and as for why I'm motivated to do it, it's the same reason that I'm motivated to do anything.
[9805.50 --> 9811.26]  That something sucks and I feel like I could do it better.
[9811.26 --> 9818.94]  Right now, the state of shopping for PC hardware online is deplorable.
[9819.92 --> 9823.80]  Like I said, we did that video with the budget power supply roundup.
[9825.22 --> 9832.66]  I couldn't, I couldn't figure out how much it cost because everywhere it was out of stock, people don't list pricing for out of stock items anymore.
[9833.52 --> 9834.90]  When did that go out of fashion?
[9835.00 --> 9835.60]  That sucks.
[9836.20 --> 9839.28]  Okay, so I couldn't, I couldn't find any pricing for this stupid thing.
[9839.28 --> 9843.34]  And I couldn't find it actually in stock at a real store anywhere.
[9843.50 --> 9852.16]  It's all just like shipped by Jimmy, Jimmy John, PC Inc. Limited through new, like I don't want to deal with that.
[9852.24 --> 9859.36]  I want to know like with some reasonable markup based on the actual cost of the item, what is this thing worth?
[9859.36 --> 9861.74]  And like, can I get it in a reasonable amount of time?
[9861.80 --> 9869.96]  So it's just the fact that it's so hard to find stuff these days that is, you know, trustworthy.
[9870.72 --> 9873.80]  Um, it's inspired me.
[9873.80 --> 9877.66]  It's, it's made me think that there's a gap that didn't exist before.
[9877.66 --> 9882.66]  And, and maybe there's room for margin for a site that is trustworthy.
[9883.16 --> 9895.66]  Like if you knew that whatever $65 or $150 power supply or whatever was the best one for that price, would you shop on that site instead?
[9896.72 --> 9897.34]  Maybe not.
[9897.34 --> 9902.34]  Maybe you would just go to that site, find out which one is the best one and just leave and buy it somewhere else.
[9902.54 --> 9909.04]  But then you'll probably get frustrated trying to find it somewhere else with, from like a seller that's actually reputable.
[9909.28 --> 9914.98]  And maybe you'll just come back or maybe you'll never leave in the first place because you'll appreciate that someone's actually doing the work to curate this stuff.
[9915.22 --> 9916.48]  I think there's room for that.
[9916.88 --> 9917.38]  I don't know.
[9917.38 --> 9928.62]  Linus, would you ever consider buying EVGA either with a partner or as an umbrella corp company run by its existing staff?
[9928.80 --> 9928.94]  No.
[9928.94 --> 9943.96]  If, if, if I was worried about the margins in PC and like in computer component retail, I am even more worried about the margins in computer component.
[9946.24 --> 9947.58]  Like manufacturing.
[9948.06 --> 9951.74]  It's an extremely cutthroat business.
[9953.80 --> 9956.00]  IDLL, greetings from Taiwan.
[9956.00 --> 9957.50]  Such a shame.
[9957.60 --> 9959.42]  It didn't run into you guys at Computex.
[9960.02 --> 9962.30]  What happened to the AMD GPU challenge?
[9962.92 --> 9967.74]  Switching to the 7900 XTX and I'm having visual bugs.
[9968.02 --> 9972.26]  I'm still waiting for Luke to put it back in his computer and send his notes so we can do the third part.
[9972.54 --> 9973.70]  No one told me this.
[9974.18 --> 9974.76]  I emailed.
[9975.62 --> 9976.04]  No.
[9976.26 --> 9976.72]  I did.
[9977.32 --> 9978.44]  You didn't email me that.
[9980.24 --> 9981.60]  You emailed that.
[9981.74 --> 9983.70]  I emailed asking if you were going to do it again.
[9984.18 --> 9985.16]  And you said yes.
[9985.16 --> 9986.40]  Mine's never left my computer.
[9987.24 --> 9988.28]  Do you have notes?
[9988.64 --> 9988.94]  Yeah.
[9989.70 --> 9993.42]  Because last I heard you didn't have notes and you told me you were going to do it.
[9994.10 --> 9994.68]  Hold on.
[9994.78 --> 9995.16]  Hold on.
[9995.92 --> 9996.32]  Okay.
[9996.62 --> 10001.10]  So I sent a follow up on, uh, okay.
[10001.16 --> 10002.16]  May 15th.
[10002.38 --> 10004.42]  I said, I can't play tears of the kingdom.
[10004.54 --> 10005.86]  I want my Nvidia GPU back.
[10006.08 --> 10007.28]  Shared you all on my notes.
[10008.24 --> 10010.32]  Um, you said something, something.
[10010.32 --> 10013.48]  I'm pretty sure it was still occasionally snowing when I took my card out.
[10014.56 --> 10016.92]  I replied with, do you guys feel you have enough to say?
[10017.04 --> 10018.52]  Luke, do you want to put it back in for a week?
[10018.64 --> 10020.64]  You say, that's probably a good idea.
[10020.78 --> 10020.98]  Yeah.
[10021.04 --> 10021.74]  I'll grab one.
[10021.86 --> 10022.66]  May 17th.
[10022.76 --> 10022.98]  Yeah.
[10023.48 --> 10024.34]  So you never did it.
[10024.50 --> 10025.88]  There's an email thread after that.
[10025.88 --> 10028.50]  And then I, and then I replied, Jake, you down to compile and write this biz?
[10028.56 --> 10030.82]  He says, yeah, but probably not feasible till we're back from Computex.
[10030.86 --> 10031.64]  I say, copy that.
[10031.90 --> 10033.16]  You say, just checking.
[10033.22 --> 10034.32]  Are you guys actually doing this?
[10034.36 --> 10034.98]  I reply, yeah.
[10035.30 --> 10035.42]  Yeah.
[10035.42 --> 10035.98]  Did you do it?
[10036.34 --> 10037.02]  What do you mean do it?
[10037.02 --> 10037.88]  It's still in my computer.
[10038.00 --> 10038.74]  I never removed it.
[10038.74 --> 10039.50]  Did you write the notes?
[10039.82 --> 10040.36]  Write what notes?
[10040.48 --> 10041.32]  Did Jake write his notes?
[10041.34 --> 10042.92]  I shared you with my, I shared you all my notes.
[10043.32 --> 10044.24]  Did Jake write his notes?
[10044.50 --> 10046.26]  Because this is the same problem we had in the past.
[10046.50 --> 10047.32]  I installed it.
[10047.50 --> 10048.52]  I wrote all my notes.
[10048.70 --> 10049.58]  I did everything.
[10049.86 --> 10051.88]  You guys said you were going to and didn't do jack.
[10052.00 --> 10054.74]  So we're in another situation where you're saying that you're going to.
[10054.80 --> 10056.32]  I didn't have time to game.
[10056.56 --> 10057.16]  I don't care.
[10057.34 --> 10058.58]  My life is busy.
[10058.72 --> 10059.56]  That's not my problem.
[10060.82 --> 10062.58]  I've got as many notes as I'm going to have.
[10062.74 --> 10064.94]  It's going to be mostly based on yours and Jake's notes.
[10064.94 --> 10066.86]  Oh my, see?
[10067.42 --> 10068.64]  Oh my goodness.
[10068.68 --> 10073.34]  My note is that I wanted to emulate Tears of the Kingdom and there's visual anomalies
[10073.34 --> 10075.30]  on our DNA three cards.
[10076.16 --> 10077.18]  That's my notes.
[10081.30 --> 10086.08]  This is high school class projects all over again, says Mystical and Floatplane Chat.
[10086.36 --> 10089.12]  Well, we're just, we're in the same spot that we were in before.
[10089.24 --> 10090.22]  We didn't get any further.
[10090.22 --> 10091.22]  Yeah.
[10091.22 --> 10091.70]  Yeah.
[10091.82 --> 10094.22]  So now it's just on me to do the testing again.
[10095.24 --> 10095.46]  Yeah.
[10096.08 --> 10099.26]  Because I already did it, but because you didn't do it the first time.
[10099.68 --> 10101.62]  I have gamed.
[10101.98 --> 10103.44]  I played Slapshot Rebound.
[10103.64 --> 10103.92]  Yeah.
[10104.36 --> 10105.20]  And it ran fine.
[10105.36 --> 10106.22]  Very good work.
[10106.68 --> 10107.36]  Thank you.
[10107.36 --> 10114.34]  You're all getting to watch how our production schedule works every single day.
[10114.58 --> 10117.04]  It's just, it's just this for 40 hours a week.
[10119.12 --> 10119.64]  Okay.
[10119.76 --> 10120.20]  Up next.
[10120.52 --> 10121.08]  Love Game Linked.
[10121.34 --> 10124.44]  How did this video style come to be like with Tech Linked?
[10124.72 --> 10128.40]  The off the cuff style with background interjections is very engaging.
[10128.80 --> 10130.26]  Was this a specific decision?
[10130.26 --> 10132.68]  I didn't care.
[10133.26 --> 10135.30]  I was completely checked out.
[10136.00 --> 10144.40]  And so I, because I was only paid based on the video quantity that was uploaded to NCIX Tech Tips,
[10145.24 --> 10150.98]  I basically stopped reviewing any scripts from the team there.
[10151.10 --> 10156.80]  Like this is a couple of years into the contract with them when I didn't even want to renew it anyway.
[10157.50 --> 10160.92]  And so I basically said, well, I'm going to read whatever is on the prompter.
[10161.08 --> 10164.90]  And if you guys want any notes on the script, then I'm just going to be providing them live.
[10164.90 --> 10169.22]  So when you look back at old episodes and I'm just like, ah, it's not a very good opening joke.
[10169.22 --> 10170.98]  And I just like make up my own on the spot.
[10171.06 --> 10172.50]  That is like actually training.
[10173.34 --> 10182.82]  Um, and then the objections that they had were because they actually wanted to reply to my commentary on their writing.
[10182.82 --> 10187.74]  And thus a whole style was born.
[10187.82 --> 10188.78]  Tech linked was born.
[10188.90 --> 10189.32]  Uh, yeah.
[10189.34 --> 10194.36]  So then when we brought Riley in to do tech linked instead of net linked, which was on the NCIX channel,
[10194.36 --> 10201.72]  we basically, I was basically just like, yeah, I love that irreverent kind of style that we developed, um, unintentionally.
[10201.72 --> 10207.48]  And I, I love that kind of adversarial back and forth that we have between the off camera writer and the, and the host.
[10207.48 --> 10209.44]  And I just, I think it's really fun and it's funny.
[10209.76 --> 10218.74]  And so we're just going to basically do what we knew, what we did together before that we know worked and was, you know, it was, it was obviously like, you know, lower quality,
[10218.74 --> 10220.96]  but in a way that I always thought was really engaging.
[10220.96 --> 10222.06]  And so we're just going to do that.
[10222.40 --> 10223.86]  And so that's what we did.
[10223.86 --> 10225.44]  And it turns out it's really good.
[10225.70 --> 10228.24]  And, um, we're going to keep doing that.
[10230.98 --> 10232.18]  Looking for some advice.
[10232.18 --> 10236.54]  I am a content creator who has made content for the likes of Tesla and Google.
[10236.74 --> 10239.36]  The bulk of my work is stuck behind an NDA.
[10239.64 --> 10242.86]  I need to update my reel, but struggle to get gig work.
[10243.96 --> 10244.40]  Hmm.
[10244.92 --> 10246.16]  Man, that's tough.
[10250.44 --> 10251.74]  This is not advice.
[10253.24 --> 10254.88]  I would just show it to people anyway.
[10256.08 --> 10261.88]  But what I'm assuming is that the NDA component of it is just that you were the one who worked on it.
[10262.18 --> 10271.98]  Um, not that it's actual, not that the content actually contains information that is bound by an NDA, but I w I would never share it digitally.
[10272.42 --> 10278.88]  I'd just be like, okay, like I worked on this and not let people like look at it too closely.
[10279.80 --> 10281.16]  That's I'm sorry.
[10281.44 --> 10282.18]  I'm sorry.
[10283.44 --> 10290.50]  If I, if I had no portfolio as a creative, I I'm what do they, what do they do?
[10290.56 --> 10290.68]  Sorry.
[10290.68 --> 10291.98]  I missed the very beginning of their message.
[10292.28 --> 10298.84]  They've done, I'm a content creator who has made content for the likes of Tesla and Google, but the bulk of my work is stuck behind an NDA.
[10299.34 --> 10302.96]  I'm assuming they mean like video content or like graphic design and stuff.
[10303.32 --> 10309.68]  I'm not, I'm assuming they do not mean content like, like engineering documents.
[10311.28 --> 10313.88]  And they're struggling to get work outside of that.
[10313.88 --> 10314.40]  Yeah.
[10317.46 --> 10319.60]  This is not legal advice to be very clear.
[10320.54 --> 10323.04]  Can you, I, yeah, it really depends on the type of content.
[10323.04 --> 10325.70]  But it's like, it's, that's a huge, that's a huge issue, right?
[10325.72 --> 10329.66]  Like if you, if you can't show anybody your portfolio.
[10329.66 --> 10332.28]  I mean, it's pretty normal for developers.
[10332.82 --> 10333.52]  Again though.
[10333.68 --> 10342.44]  So again, my assumption initially was that this is content that will be shown somewhere at some point, but just their involvement might be under NDA.
[10342.54 --> 10344.84]  Like I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but.
[10345.52 --> 10346.36]  Weird NDA, is it not?
[10347.00 --> 10347.74]  Not necessarily.
[10347.74 --> 10347.86]  Weird NDA, is it not necessarily?
[10349.40 --> 10350.04]  I don't know.
[10351.96 --> 10353.46]  I guess I'd need more details.
[10353.70 --> 10354.18]  Why don't we do that?
[10354.18 --> 10356.34]  Yeah, it really depends on the type of content, I think.
[10359.40 --> 10361.84]  Yeah, people in chat are saying like, just say you worked for Tesla and Google.
[10361.98 --> 10367.74]  Like, yeah, like you don't, you don't expect people to show you the code that they worked on at Google when you're hiring a developer.
[10367.74 --> 10368.92]  Well, no, it wouldn't be development.
[10369.48 --> 10369.98]  Yeah, but like.
[10369.98 --> 10371.40]  But they could show you the finished product.
[10372.76 --> 10373.88]  Like I worked on this.
[10373.94 --> 10374.64]  Usually, often, no.
[10375.80 --> 10377.46]  Oh, yeah, I guess if it's an internal tool.
[10377.46 --> 10378.22]  It's an internal projects.
[10378.40 --> 10378.88]  Yeah, okay.
[10379.00 --> 10379.60]  That's fair enough.
[10381.46 --> 10382.70]  Ah, yeah, that's tough.
[10386.16 --> 10386.82]  That's what I'm saying.
[10386.88 --> 10388.30]  Like, what kind of content is this?
[10388.32 --> 10388.78]  I don't know.
[10389.54 --> 10393.88]  See, I have to confess, my initial reaction was it's like ads.
[10394.66 --> 10397.14]  So if it's not, though, like if, okay.
[10397.38 --> 10407.20]  So say, for example, when we were at the Intel Fab, I was shown a HoloLens project that allows you to like repair the machines in the Fab.
[10407.46 --> 10409.46]  As someone who absolutely doesn't know anything.
[10409.68 --> 10413.98]  And someone can provide like remote assistance and it's like augmented reality showing you what to do.
[10414.04 --> 10418.96]  If you created that and you like tried to show that to someone, you're obviously going to get your butt sued.
[10418.96 --> 10421.72]  So that's content.
[10421.72 --> 10424.08]  But I didn't really think about that kind of content.
[10424.08 --> 10424.78]  So you know what?
[10424.94 --> 10425.76]  I take it back.
[10426.78 --> 10427.46]  You're boned.
[10428.96 --> 10430.48]  I don't really know what to tell you.
[10431.18 --> 10432.02]  It's really tough.
[10434.12 --> 10434.52]  Yeah.
[10434.52 --> 10438.60]  Can you give more thoughts on if you're switching to iOS?
[10441.68 --> 10442.42]  I can't.
[10442.82 --> 10444.52]  I talked about it on WAN Show last week.
[10444.58 --> 10446.50]  I had to sideload an app a little while ago.
[10446.56 --> 10449.14]  And it's like, how can I live without being able to sideload apps?
[10449.18 --> 10449.76]  That's ridiculous.
[10449.94 --> 10451.68]  I'll install whatever apps I want on my phone.
[10451.74 --> 10452.46]  It's my damn phone.
[10452.84 --> 10455.00]  So no, I don't think it's happening.
[10455.16 --> 10455.60]  Good take.
[10455.68 --> 10456.32]  At least not now.
[10456.64 --> 10457.64]  It's my favorite take.
[10458.34 --> 10458.98]  Love the show.
[10459.08 --> 10459.44]  Keep it up.
[10459.44 --> 10464.06]  Any updates on the release timeline on the NAS product you are investing in?
[10465.02 --> 10465.54]  Nope.
[10466.64 --> 10469.00]  They're very much in stealth mode right now.
[10469.10 --> 10485.20]  But what I will say is after our recent collaboration with a content creator, they cannot come out of stealth mode soon enough for me because we ran into some stupid thing in TrueNAS with stupid sharing permissions and the interface is obtuse.
[10485.20 --> 10500.18]  And it's like the fact that they don't have a one button like, yeah, I just want like a completely normal NAS that just has guest access in a Windows environment is absolutely mind blowing to me.
[10500.40 --> 10508.18]  So I can't wait for these guys to just have something that is not just stupid to use.
[10509.22 --> 10513.94]  You don't need like to be an engineer to just set up a basic NAS.
[10513.94 --> 10521.78]  I think a lot more people would just, you know, grab an old computer and huck some hard drives in it if it was as easy as what they're aiming to do.
[10523.26 --> 10523.74]  Okay.
[10523.80 --> 10525.22]  This is a really interesting one.
[10526.12 --> 10531.18]  Where can I learn to build infrastructure with enterprise specifications but a jank budget?
[10531.58 --> 10541.82]  We're underfunded biologists and deal with multi-TB, 5D, 3D color plus time, movies of embryos developing and brains firing.
[10541.82 --> 10548.36]  There is a massive community of homebrew enthusiasts.
[10549.36 --> 10553.92]  There's also a ton of open source stuff in that space.
[10554.78 --> 10555.02]  Yeah.
[10555.16 --> 10559.46]  I mean, if what you want is just sort of that reliability.
[10559.46 --> 10566.94]  You're asking where to learn it, not necessarily the name of the...
[10566.94 --> 10571.06]  I mean, level one techs might be a little deep for like the very basics.
[10571.06 --> 10572.54]  It really depends where you're starting.
[10572.74 --> 10573.52]  Yeah, I don't know where you're starting.
[10573.52 --> 10575.38]  There's a lot of information here that might be lagging.
[10575.64 --> 10577.96]  I honestly would go to the forum.
[10578.20 --> 10580.34]  I can tell you that stuff's definitely out there.
[10580.34 --> 10593.10]  You can get decommissioned servers for next to nothing that are still perfectly reliable and especially can be configured with often open source free software to be very resilient.
[10593.96 --> 10595.72]  But this is like you're answering that.
[10595.80 --> 10597.40]  Some people in chat are saying buy on eBay.
[10597.54 --> 10598.64]  They're asking where to learn.
[10599.00 --> 10600.12]  Yeah, that's a tough one.
[10600.68 --> 10600.86]  Yeah.
[10600.96 --> 10603.74]  We're trying to answer the like easy answers.
[10604.20 --> 10604.30]  Yeah.
[10604.30 --> 10605.82]  Someone's saying r slash homelab.
[10605.94 --> 10607.22]  So yeah, there's Reddit.
[10607.22 --> 10610.96]  I honestly would genuinely suggest LTT forum.
[10611.14 --> 10613.26]  There are some extreme storage nerds on there.
[10613.46 --> 10616.44]  I know there's a lot of storage nerds on r slash data hoarders as well.
[10616.60 --> 10617.00]  Yeah.
[10617.70 --> 10620.22]  It's more just like storage porn, I know.
[10620.34 --> 10623.96]  But like, you might be able to pick up some stuff.
[10624.18 --> 10624.78]  Level one forum.
[10625.08 --> 10625.28]  Yep.
[10625.56 --> 10625.82]  Yeah.
[10625.94 --> 10627.82]  So not just the videos, but also the forums.
[10627.94 --> 10628.34]  Definitely.
[10628.56 --> 10628.68]  Yeah.
[10628.70 --> 10630.02]  LTT forum, level one forum.
[10630.82 --> 10632.92]  There's a lot of knowledgeable people out there.
[10632.92 --> 10637.92]  And if you ask in a way that's not obnoxious, you may get some legitimate help.
[10638.14 --> 10639.70]  Especially if you describe what you're doing.
[10640.38 --> 10640.60]  Yeah.
[10640.70 --> 10641.82]  I mean, that's awesome.
[10642.14 --> 10643.76]  I think everybody would pile on top of that.
[10643.98 --> 10644.14]  Yeah.
[10644.78 --> 10645.50]  5D videos.
[10645.56 --> 10646.02]  That's awesome.
[10647.10 --> 10647.50]  Okay.
[10647.80 --> 10649.20]  Last one I have here for Curated.
[10649.62 --> 10650.72]  Hey, LLND.
[10650.72 --> 10656.88]  I've had my LTT screwdriver for a month or so now and have never been so in love with a tool.
[10657.36 --> 10660.30]  Can we have a reminder of the ETA for the stubby?
[10660.68 --> 10662.18]  Can't wait to add it to my toolkit.
[10662.52 --> 10663.54]  Uh, one month.
[10663.86 --> 10664.10]  Ish.
[10664.46 --> 10664.78]  Ish.
[10665.02 --> 10665.30]  Ish.
[10666.94 --> 10667.42]  Fake.
[10668.88 --> 10669.36]  Okay.
[10669.50 --> 10671.70]  Now let's move into potentials, I guess.
[10673.94 --> 10674.74]  You're the boss.
[10676.36 --> 10676.84]  Okay.
[10677.34 --> 10678.48]  I'll just start at the top.
[10679.10 --> 10680.14]  Good evening, DLL.
[10680.14 --> 10681.24]  Question for all of you.
[10681.54 --> 10683.64]  Is this where you thought you would be in your 30s?
[10683.72 --> 10686.02]  In life, work, etc.?
[10686.02 --> 10687.06]  Oh my god.
[10689.28 --> 10692.20]  I never thought about being 30 someday.
[10693.94 --> 10695.64]  Now I think about being 40.
[10696.48 --> 10701.06]  30 is like, I don't know, it's like the in-between, I guess.
[10702.14 --> 10704.44]  I don't care about the age at all.
[10704.44 --> 10708.78]  The only thing that annoys me is just how constantly broken slash tired I feel.
[10708.78 --> 10712.66]  If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't even slightly care.
[10712.78 --> 10714.18]  I don't care about the age lines.
[10714.56 --> 10717.32]  I don't care about the gray bits that are showing up in my beard.
[10717.50 --> 10720.38]  I don't care about when my head hair will go gray.
[10721.12 --> 10722.40]  I don't care about getting wrinkles.
[10722.60 --> 10724.12]  Would you care about losing the head hair?
[10724.42 --> 10725.12]  No, to be honest.
[10725.96 --> 10726.82]  I could go without it.
[10726.82 --> 10729.98]  My dad's not had it the entire time I think I've been alive.
[10730.16 --> 10734.00]  I was expecting it to happen and then I figured out that you get it from your mom's side, not your dad's side.
[10734.02 --> 10735.04]  And I was like, oh, I guess I'm good then.
[10735.04 --> 10738.12]  But yeah, I'm not worried about any of that stuff.
[10738.44 --> 10746.54]  I just don't like that like if I go do a physical activity, I'm like sore for a really long time.
[10746.90 --> 10748.70]  It's like, well, that sucks.
[10750.48 --> 10753.76]  And like if I get sick, it feels like the recovery window is much longer.
[10754.48 --> 10756.80]  If I get injured, the recovery window seems a lot.
[10757.24 --> 10761.72]  It's getting to the point already where I feel like injuries are like semi-permanent.
[10763.00 --> 10765.84]  Like if I get injured in a certain way, it's like, oh, okay.
[10765.98 --> 10766.70]  This could be it.
[10766.80 --> 10769.18]  Like I hurt my thumb like months ago.
[10769.38 --> 10769.58]  Yeah.
[10769.62 --> 10770.76]  My thumb is still in pain.
[10770.98 --> 10774.78]  As far as I can tell, my thumb is going to be in pain for the rest of my life.
[10775.22 --> 10777.50]  And it's just like, all right, like I'm going to physio for it.
[10777.60 --> 10778.48]  I'm working on stuff.
[10778.78 --> 10783.78]  It's function is improving, but the grip in my left hand is still significantly worse than my right
[10783.78 --> 10786.04]  because of this weird thing that's going on with my thumb.
[10786.04 --> 10789.44]  And it's just like, I don't even know how it happened.
[10789.56 --> 10793.72]  Like there's just, yeah, things are just kind of, you know, falling apart.
[10794.46 --> 10801.16]  The current status of the ship is, it is not improving over time anymore.
[10801.48 --> 10801.72]  You know?
[10802.96 --> 10803.40]  Yeah.
[10803.98 --> 10809.68]  There have been a lot of fairly janky and surprisingly robust projects we've gotten the chance to see from LMG.
[10810.20 --> 10812.32]  What projects have been your favorite to film?
[10812.54 --> 10814.24]  Any projects that we never got to see?
[10814.24 --> 10819.14]  Um, man, favorites to film.
[10819.52 --> 10822.36]  Definitely a lot of the stuff at the house was a lot of fun.
[10822.80 --> 10826.98]  I always like building stuff that I know we don't have to take apart immediately after.
[10826.98 --> 10838.56]  Um, oh, something we haven't filmed yet is there's a new 1U gaming design, like gaming machine design for the land room at the, at the new house.
[10839.08 --> 10845.18]  Um, the, the labs engineers did a fantastic job of the design for this thing.
[10845.18 --> 10848.90]  And we no longer need like $700 each custom cases for it.
[10848.98 --> 10852.50]  So, uh, that video is probably going to get shot in the next couple of weeks here.
[10852.52 --> 10853.26]  I'm super excited.
[10853.26 --> 10856.04]  Oh, that's what they're working on.
[10856.10 --> 10856.70]  I saw that too.
[10856.78 --> 10857.32]  That looks sick.
[10858.32 --> 10864.02]  Hey guys, I work at Best Buy and have seen almost every ROG ally we've sold get returned.
[10864.54 --> 10867.86]  The reason seems to be buggy software and lackluster battery life.
[10868.26 --> 10869.72]  What did you guys think of it now?
[10870.68 --> 10871.08]  Really?
[10871.08 --> 10872.46]  That's kind of surprising.
[10872.58 --> 10874.82]  I guess I just knew what I was getting into.
[10874.92 --> 10883.16]  Whereas the more average, typical Best Buy customer might be expecting a more cohesive switch-like experience.
[10883.86 --> 10887.74]  I'd be interested to know if that's just something that's unique to your store.
[10887.88 --> 10892.02]  Like maybe you're in a not as tech savvy area.
[10892.02 --> 10897.08]  I don't even know how to, how to generalize, um, something like that.
[10898.44 --> 10899.78]  That's really interesting though.
[10901.08 --> 10908.20]  Is there any planning to make an investment module for customization items for the upcoming brand new episodes to you?
[10909.48 --> 10915.04]  No, I think we're kind of just relying on the rest of the community to be amazing and creative.
[10915.26 --> 10920.10]  Like I, I had tried to come up with some stuff when Nirav, the CEO, was here.
[10920.10 --> 10924.12]  And everything I said was already being done or had already been done by someone.
[10924.28 --> 10925.00]  So I was just like, okay.
[10925.18 --> 10925.58]  You were muted.
[10925.76 --> 10926.10]  Watch it.
[10926.34 --> 10926.72]  Yeah, I know.
[10928.32 --> 10930.56]  Oh, should I say what the question was?
[10930.56 --> 10931.18]  Yeah, yeah.
[10931.28 --> 10934.72]  Custom modules or customization items for the upcoming Framework 16.
[10934.82 --> 10935.02]  Yeah.
[10935.12 --> 10941.12]  And the answer was no, I'm not even going to try because you guys are collectively much more creative than I could ever be.
[10942.24 --> 10942.92]  Hello, LLD.
[10943.24 --> 10949.86]  You guys are known for your tech tips, but have you made, sorry, but you have made a successful business.
[10950.02 --> 10952.42]  Have you ever thought of sharing business tips or advice?
[10952.42 --> 10954.54]  Or do you have good resources to share?
[10955.48 --> 10964.20]  The business team has been bothering me to do a book or like a course, like a video course or something for many years.
[10964.20 --> 10974.54]  And I, I don't know, there's some stuff that I could talk about, but realistically, I think the vast majority of anything I could possibly write would be in a WAN show somewhere already anyway.
[10975.08 --> 10979.46]  Like I, I'm a pretty open book with you guys for better or for worse sometimes.
[10979.46 --> 10980.06]  Yeah.
[10980.06 --> 10980.08]  And...
[10980.08 --> 10983.74]  We're going to take the extra on the shipping.
[10987.36 --> 10987.84]  What?
[10987.86 --> 10988.44]  I got to eat.
[10996.38 --> 10997.24]  Dan's got to eat.
[10997.42 --> 10998.30]  The book, the book...
[10998.30 --> 11001.02]  Your shipping, your shipping pays for my food.
[11002.92 --> 11004.04]  The book's pretty open.
[11004.96 --> 11006.24]  I don't think it has a spine.
[11006.36 --> 11007.00]  It's just pages.
[11008.10 --> 11011.52]  Linus, take on lots of debt so you feel pressured to work hard.
[11011.84 --> 11012.40]  Get lucky.
[11013.36 --> 11013.76]  Yeah.
[11017.26 --> 11019.30]  Hey, DLL, this question is for Linus.
[11019.70 --> 11024.14]  I'm a new father and I worry about responsibility introducing my son to tech.
[11024.74 --> 11028.18]  Where do I draw the line between protecting and sheltering?
[11029.30 --> 11030.06]  I don't know.
[11030.22 --> 11034.58]  Sometimes I feel like my kids are not protected enough and other times I feel like they're too sheltered.
[11034.62 --> 11042.98]  I think the best thing if you're a parent is to know you're going to get it wrong and just try to get it a little more right next time.
[11043.52 --> 11047.48]  And if you do that for 18 years, then hopefully they'll be functional adults.
[11047.64 --> 11051.72]  But if the general population is anything to go by, they probably won't be.
[11051.84 --> 11053.06]  So don't feel too bad.
[11055.78 --> 11056.90]  Hi, LLD.
[11056.90 --> 11063.80]  D, have you guys received any feedback from Microsoft regarding the Windows sleep issue on laptops where it would drain all the battery?
[11064.32 --> 11064.54]  No.
[11064.86 --> 11065.70]  Not that I'm aware of.
[11065.76 --> 11066.44]  Good question, though.
[11067.52 --> 11068.62]  Hey, Dan and the talent.
[11068.90 --> 11073.12]  What's the craziest thing you've gotten to do through YouTube that you would never have guessed you'd do?
[11073.38 --> 11074.12]  Go to NASA?
[11074.12 --> 11074.24]  NASA?
[11075.68 --> 11076.60]  So sick.
[11077.36 --> 11078.50]  Definitely the Intel fab.
[11078.50 --> 11079.60]  That was on my bucket list.
[11079.74 --> 11081.08]  That's so sick, too.
[11081.08 --> 11088.90]  I vaguely remember a WAN show where Linus mentioned an LTT desk that they couldn't figure out how to stock and distribute.
[11088.90 --> 11093.96]  If such a thing exists, what about releasing the plans for a fee, even?
[11093.96 --> 11102.78]  The problem is that the plans for it are rudimentary and only good enough for us to use as a reference to do something that is pretty much in our mind.
[11102.78 --> 11107.52]  So I don't think we're going to be releasing those because they're not in a usable state.
[11107.94 --> 11113.00]  As for whether we would ever do a desk, I think we'd need to find the right partner for manufacturing and distribution.
[11113.18 --> 11115.50]  It's not something that we would want to figure out on our own.
[11115.78 --> 11116.82]  It's definitely appealing.
[11117.14 --> 11119.26]  There's good margin in it, good ASPs.
[11119.26 --> 11128.14]  I think that it's a market that is not actually very well addressed in terms of building something that's both quality and really functional.
[11128.90 --> 11134.90]  But we're in no hurry to get that going anytime soon.
[11136.04 --> 11137.06]  Hello, future me.
[11137.52 --> 11139.46]  Linus, I want to start a company.
[11139.80 --> 11145.14]  Quality appliances that don't suck is one of the many ideas I've had, but I don't know where to start.
[11145.46 --> 11146.00]  Any tips?
[11146.00 --> 11150.42]  Start with something much smaller than an appliance.
[11151.54 --> 11152.88]  I think that's the best thing.
[11153.00 --> 11157.50]  Find something that you think you can really add something to that's simple.
[11157.60 --> 11161.14]  I mean, it took us three years to build a screwdriver, and that's not because we're idiots.
[11161.86 --> 11169.56]  It's because to build something quality is way harder than just shipping something.
[11169.56 --> 11179.14]  So I would say start really small, and don't overextend your finances.
[11179.60 --> 11184.44]  Those are probably the best bits of advice that I can give you if you're trying to start a business from scratch.
[11185.52 --> 11188.94]  Hey, LLD, can I get a hot take on the printer industry?
[11189.34 --> 11192.50]  From overpriced ink to mandatory software downloads and more.
[11193.04 --> 11193.90]  Framework printer.
[11193.90 --> 11199.52]  I don't even think it's a hot take to say that the printer industry is a giant steaming pile of garbage.
[11201.36 --> 11208.32]  I think we actually bought like 15 printers, and we're working on like a which printer is the least horrible video.
[11208.68 --> 11209.70]  Oh, is that what that shelf is?
[11209.70 --> 11212.14]  I think it's been stalled for quite some time, though.
[11212.14 --> 11215.54]  Yeah, I can see that.
[11216.24 --> 11217.92]  And last of my curated I have here.
[11218.62 --> 11221.02]  What is the lab's purchase that got you the most excited?
[11221.42 --> 11228.56]  P.S. I brought my LTT backpack to the South Pole, but due to NSF rules, couldn't get any good pictures to share.
[11230.00 --> 11231.46]  All right. Well, that's cool.
[11231.46 --> 11236.28]  I'd say the most exciting purchase.
[11236.62 --> 11237.76]  It's kind of irrational.
[11238.06 --> 11239.32]  It's like so nerdy, right?
[11239.40 --> 11242.50]  But I really was excited about the power supply tester.
[11244.58 --> 11245.76]  Most excited, though.
[11245.82 --> 11247.28]  I mean, the robot's really cool.
[11248.66 --> 11254.00]  Maybe the theater room, I think, because we're going to use the theater room for all our display testing,
[11254.00 --> 11260.02]  and it's going to be designed for viewing displays in the most optimal conditions.
[11260.36 --> 11266.32]  I think that that's going to be amazing, because as much as I love the setup I have at home,
[11266.64 --> 11273.06]  I imagine some stuff is going to roll through the lab that is way beyond what I would consider to be practical
[11273.06 --> 11275.74]  or even affordable, depending on what we can get our hands on.
[11276.22 --> 11279.10]  And so I think there's going to be some experiences to have in there.
[11280.28 --> 11282.20]  Okay. Two more here in incoming.
[11282.20 --> 11284.60]  Hey, from the UK, watching live.
[11284.72 --> 11285.76]  You must be running late.
[11286.32 --> 11288.66]  Is there any chance of women's hoodies?
[11289.50 --> 11290.76]  Oh, yes.
[11291.14 --> 11291.90]  There's a chance.
[11292.32 --> 11293.00]  That's good enough for me.
[11293.54 --> 11295.50]  And the last one I have for today.
[11295.90 --> 11299.10]  Any chance of getting merch message transcripts after streams?
[11299.40 --> 11304.36]  So many interesting questions get answered, but I can't split my attention between the video and messages.
[11304.62 --> 11305.68]  Would love to read them later.
[11306.02 --> 11307.62]  No, probably not.
[11307.62 --> 11315.96]  We have thought about potentially having it email the question asker the response.
[11316.18 --> 11321.14]  That might be something that we implement later, but not right now.
[11321.14 --> 11328.28]  And I think Linus is replying to the last one.
[11328.36 --> 11328.56]  Boom!
[11328.62 --> 11328.96]  Got him!
[11329.16 --> 11330.00]  That's all I got for you.
[11330.24 --> 11332.16]  Thank you so much for tuning in.
[11332.32 --> 11334.78]  We will see you all again next time.
[11334.88 --> 11336.66]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[11337.34 --> 11337.70]  Bye!
[11337.70 --> 11346.68]  We're going to end up doing WAN show for long enough that nobody is even going to understand what reference that is anymore at some point.
[11348.70 --> 11349.34]  God willing.
[11349.66 --> 11351.70]  Then again, you and I are both in a race to die, so...
[11351.70 --> 11361.68]  I will be really interested to see what happens to the channel now that we stream over by going in a race- History club has so much PLA.
[11361.70 --> 11362.90]  You know that.
[11362.90 --> 11364.46]  amounts for your equipment to the vurыш였or.
[11364.46 --> 11364.56]  adequate solutions.
[11364.56 --> 11365.56]  That really means that would be enough.
[11367.70 --> 11369.40]  True.
[11370.66 --> 11371.16]  True.
[11372.12 --> 11372.62]  True.
[11373.00 --> 11373.62]  True.
[11375.42 --> 11376.18]  True.
[11376.34 --> 11376.94]  Interesting.
[11376.94 --> 11377.22]  True.
[11377.26 --> 11377.28]  True.
[11380.02 --> 11381.08]  True.
[11381.34 --> 11381.68]  Thank you.
[11381.70 --> 11411.68]  Thank you.
