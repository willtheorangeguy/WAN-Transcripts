[0.00 → 2.46] And welcome to the WAN show. It's still Friday, right?
[2.78 → 3.02] Yeah.
[3.22 → 4.64] Yeah, a little on the right side.
[4.76 → 5.76] Yeah, not for long, but...
[5.76 → 6.32] I blame Luke.
[6.50 → 8.62] We've got a lot of great topics for you today.
[8.76 → 11.38] First and foremost being what is up with the title and headline.
[11.78 → 13.28] It's because I lose.
[14.08 → 16.76] Today's show is going to be pretty AI heavy.
[17.04 → 21.06] So Luke is going to get to talk about AI agents gaining steam.
[21.42 → 23.40] That is pretty vague.
[23.40 → 30.44] And also Elon Musk pivoting Twitter to an AI everything app.
[30.60 → 31.66] Whatever that means.
[31.82 → 33.16] What else are we talking about today?
[33.34 → 36.38] So I'm going to announce the non-AI topics, and you're going to announce the AI topics.
[36.38 → 37.32] I think that would be fun.
[37.66 → 43.46] Microsoft could be working on a Windows handheld mode for Steam Deck alike.
[44.24 → 44.86] I'm excited.
[45.02 → 45.62] Things that are similar to that.
[45.68 → 47.24] That is actually pretty interesting.
[47.56 → 49.54] We'll talk more about that later though.
[49.54 → 54.54] Also, do we talk about this one?
[55.16 → 56.50] Is this going to be the Elon show?
[56.98 → 57.50] No.
[58.62 → 60.04] Pick anything else.
[62.26 → 64.36] The 4070 release.
[64.90 → 65.54] I don't know.
[65.78 → 66.06] All right.
[66.08 → 66.80] Which one did you pick?
[66.80 → 66.98] All right.
[79.54 → 91.72] The show is brought to you today by Jump Cloud, Goliath Technologies, and Sea sonic.
[92.60 → 93.52] All right.
[93.62 → 101.10] Why don't we jump right into our headline topic here today, which is AI agents gaining steam.
[101.56 → 101.68] Yeah.
[102.32 → 103.56] Why don't I read it?
[103.72 → 106.96] And then you can spend the next 25 minutes talking about what I read.
[107.12 → 107.60] Sure.
[107.60 → 111.64] There's been a surge in development of AI agents.
[111.92 → 112.32] Interjection.
[113.18 → 118.36] These are applications that allow large language models to operate semi-autonomously by feeding
[118.36 → 124.74] prompts to themselves until they have achieved a broad general goal given to them by the user.
[124.86 → 125.38] Sort of correct.
[125.70 → 133.48] Currently trending on GitHub is AutoGPT, which uses GPT-4 to generate, prioritize, and execute
[133.48 → 137.28] tasks using plugins for internet browsing and other access.
[137.28 → 151.38] It uses outside memory to keep track of what it's doing and provide context, which lets it evaluate its current situation, generate new tasks, or self-correct and add new tasks to the queue, which it then prioritizes.
[152.04 → 162.32] AutoGPT currently has a notable tendency to become distracted or confused when given complex goals, often getting caught in recursive loops and leaving tasks half-finished.
[162.32 → 168.18] Users have been creating tools that allow AutoGPT to perform more tasks, including one that allows
[168.18 → 171.26] it to access and use Bitcoin wallets.
[171.40 → 174.78] Before I go any further, do you want to talk a little bit about AI agents?
[174.88 → 178.92] You said that my definition was not quite correct, so I invite you to give a better one.
[178.92 → 184.92] Yeah, it mentioned something about them being able to just give themselves more than one prompt.
[185.06 → 185.28] Yes.
[185.42 → 188.54] But a big part of the idea is that they can use other systems.
[189.18 → 191.20] So, like, they can use an image generator.
[191.34 → 196.74] They can use some other model, whatever, services that aren't even AI-based, etc.
[196.88 → 198.44] They can call out to other services.
[198.44 → 201.32] They don't just have to use their own stuff.
[201.32 → 204.16] Also, I like that we're calling them AI agents.
[205.36 → 209.82] AutoGPT has been used as, like, what I'm calling, like, a Kleenex term.
[210.22 → 210.52] Right.
[210.68 → 216.34] Like, a lot of people have been calling all of them AutoGPT, even though there is one specific one called AutoGPT.
[217.22 → 217.62] Whatever.
[217.90 → 221.08] The AutoGPT name is actually perfect, which is why I think that's happening.
[221.80 → 224.26] Other people are calling them, like, Baby AGI.
[225.08 → 226.02] I don't like that.
[226.28 → 229.10] Sorry, like, artificial general intelligence?
[229.10 → 235.92] Yeah, but they're calling it, like, a baby version because it can, like, task out to other things and improve on itself and do stuff like that.
[235.94 → 243.68] This is, like, the whole thing where we rebranded machine learning as AI when that's not really, right?
[243.80 → 244.74] That's just branding.
[245.00 → 248.92] We rebranded driving assists as autopilot.
[249.36 → 250.74] Yeah, like, ugh.
[250.80 → 253.12] I promise we're not going to talk about him the whole show.
[254.10 → 257.82] I do really like, yeah, AutoGPT is a fantastic name.
[257.82 → 259.34] There are a bunch of these systems.
[259.48 → 263.80] There's actually a load, like, a huge amount of them because it's the trend right now.
[264.18 → 272.44] And in this whole space, if something catches on even slightly, you can absolutely bet there will be a ton of it almost immediately.
[272.80 → 279.70] Now, you've given some examples of things that people are doing with these agents on past shows, but is there a new stuff that's come to light this week?
[279.70 → 284.32] Or just a refresher for those of us who, right now, it sounds very vague and nebulous.
[284.48 → 286.88] Well, it can call to stuff and it can do things.
[287.32 → 289.36] What are some of the things people are doing with this?
[289.64 → 300.76] So, basically, with current, with what most people currently have access to if all they do is, like, go to OpenAI's website is GPT 4 or 3.5 or below.
[300.76 → 305.68] And with that, you can usually get the steps that you would need to do to accomplish something.
[305.72 → 305.94] Sure.
[305.98 → 306.84] If you ask it how to do it.
[306.84 → 308.02] How do I build a computer?
[308.52 → 308.72] Right?
[308.86 → 317.48] So, instead of how do I build a computer and it's listing steps, you could say how do I build a computer, and it could actually just, like, order for me.
[317.48 → 318.16] Potentially.
[318.36 → 325.74] If you hooked it up to the right things, because, like, someone has actually used it to buy their groceries for the week.
[326.14 → 328.42] They're like, I need recipes for a week.
[328.50 → 329.96] These are the types of things that I like.
[330.50 → 332.00] This is the grocery store or whatever.
[332.14 → 336.78] They hooked it up to some grocery delivery service that I don't remember the name of.
[336.78 → 342.12] And it actually purchased the groceries and made it so that, like, oh, you bought a can of this.
[342.26 → 344.32] You only need X amount of it for one meal.
[344.46 → 350.02] But I picked a different meal, so you're not eating the same thing all the time, that will use the rest of it in order to be efficient.
[350.22 → 352.90] Like, it did all this stuff that was really, perfect.
[354.18 → 356.04] It planned their meals for the week.
[356.12 → 357.58] It ordered everything for them.
[357.68 → 359.76] It gave them recipes for all the meals.
[359.88 → 361.90] And it efficiently used the ingredients.
[361.90 → 381.50] Do you remember when microtransactions took off in mobile games and every other flip and win show, we were talking about some kid going to town on mom or dad's credit card, buying a bunch of jewels or Twitch bits or whatever else it is, racking up thousands of dollars.
[381.50 → 395.76] How long is it going to be before someone sues OpenAI for ChatGPT spending a bunch of their money when they were the ones who were irresponsible enough to give it their credit card?
[395.86 → 396.80] Oh, it's going to be a problem.
[397.02 → 400.32] You mentioned in here connecting it to Bitcoin wallets, right?
[400.40 → 400.70] Yeah.
[400.84 → 406.62] Well, people are using that to use GPT-style models to bet on markets for them.
[406.62 → 406.90] Oh, no.
[407.18 → 408.88] That is 100% already happening.
[408.88 → 417.78] There is even these websites where you can get auto-trading bots for coin exchanges.
[418.76 → 426.70] And they already have, like, you can build your own bot using GPT models and give it its own weights and everything using that instead of needing to code it yourself, etc., etc.
[428.18 → 430.50] Yeah, it's getting pretty nuts.
[430.50 → 444.32] I was reading one thread on a person who spent, I think it was, like, I think they said roughly eight hours, like, tuning things in and whatnot, working with, I believe it was AutoGPT specifically, but I don't fully remember.
[445.16 → 446.98] And they made a tool.
[447.14 → 448.20] I don't remember what the tool did.
[448.20 → 454.74] But they got, like, 1,000 users for their tool and were able to sell their, like, startup company all within, like, a week.
[455.88 → 457.20] Which is just...
[457.92 → 458.64] That's crazy.
[458.92 → 460.20] Yeah, people are also talking about...
[460.72 → 468.80] I forget who I was talking to, but they were saying they know of someone who basically gave it a little bit of money and said, go build an online business.
[468.80 → 469.20] It's...
[469.20 → 476.04] It built it, got, like, what, 1,000 users or something like that in some obscenely short period of time and then sold it.
[476.28 → 476.40] Yep.
[477.42 → 478.30] There's also...
[478.30 → 484.60] Someone has actually even just asked it, get me money, without giving it any money.
[485.04 → 491.04] And what it did is it, like, asked them for some of their, like, personal details and stuff, and it scraped government websites.
[491.04 → 496.04] And it scraped websites that do...
[496.58 → 499.84] Man, what is it called when there's, like, a lawsuit or something?
[499.94 → 502.16] You, like, bought a product, and you get...
[502.16 → 502.42] Recalls.
[502.86 → 503.04] No.
[503.04 → 504.08] Or, like, class action.
[504.08 → 504.28] You get money back.
[504.42 → 504.58] Yeah.
[504.72 → 510.98] So it scraped, like, class action lawsuit things, and it grabbed everything it could for them.
[510.98 → 519.38] Like, different grants from government because of whatever details about the person and whatever class action lawsuits they were eligible to get money from, etc., etc., etc., etc.
[519.38 → 521.20] And it made them, like, a few hundred bucks.
[521.94 → 523.82] Like, it wasn't even that small of an amount of money.
[524.98 → 525.34] Unbelievable.
[526.32 → 526.68] Yeah.
[527.92 → 529.06] There's a really cool experiment.
[529.22 → 530.62] Do you want to keep reading or do you want me to do it?
[531.46 → 531.82] Sure.
[532.22 → 533.00] You know what?
[533.06 → 533.94] You just...
[533.94 → 535.86] My brain is tired.
[536.68 → 539.24] Stanford and Google researchers have been performing a series of...
[539.24 → 541.40] This is wild to me.
[541.40 → 546.66] We were actually talking last week about AI integration into games and how it might be able to go.
[546.88 → 549.00] So this is particularly very interesting.
[549.00 → 553.24] Yeah, he messages me this white paper, like, earlier this week, like...
[553.24 → 560.08] That's basically what message contents were.
[560.56 → 563.00] That's honestly more accurate than I would like to admit.
[563.56 → 574.46] Stanford and Google researchers have been performing a series of experiments with similar AI-powered agents by having LLMs control 25 characters within a virtual town.
[574.46 → 582.00] The characters can communicate, interact with their environment, remember events, reflect on those events, and form plans.
[582.30 → 589.60] Each is preloaded with a starting persona and an existing relationship with the other characters in the game.
[589.60 → 596.92] Over the course of several in-world days, the characters engaged in a series of complex interactions based on those starting conditions.
[597.44 → 598.84] Researchers told one...
[598.84 → 600.60] This is the really cool part, in my opinion.
[601.14 → 607.88] Researchers told one generative agent to host a Valentine's Day party without any further human intervention.
[607.88 → 614.14] The character invited nine other characters, who then passed on the information to four other characters beyond that.
[614.38 → 624.56] The characters remembered the invitation, reorganized their daily schedule in response to it, with one asking another officially on a like, romantic date to the event.
[624.56 → 631.80] Prove to me now that we are not living in a simulation.
[632.10 → 633.00] Oh, boy.
[633.26 → 636.26] We're doing the Silicon Valley tech bro conversation.
[636.58 → 638.40] You can't prove it's not a simulation.
[639.90 → 640.72] Yeah, I don't know.
[640.82 → 649.54] I think what this immediately made me think of is, like, because you were talking about how, like, you want tailored conversations for your games.
[649.70 → 649.90] Yeah.
[649.90 → 654.14] Like, you don't really want an LLM to just go in and write all the text for the game.
[654.28 → 655.90] Yeah, because I want...
[656.60 → 657.32] It's kind of like...
[657.32 → 657.52] Okay.
[657.78 → 663.90] It's kind of like playing Breath of the Wild compared to playing a game that has an auto-generated environment.
[664.18 → 664.50] Like, okay.
[664.78 → 665.46] You and I...
[665.46 → 665.58] Okay.
[666.02 → 671.12] These are examples that are pulled from vastly different eras of gaming.
[671.26 → 673.82] So I understand that they are not directly comparable.
[674.18 → 676.22] But we did a run of Diablo 1.
[676.52 → 676.72] Yeah.
[676.72 → 677.38] A while back.
[677.52 → 679.40] Just, like, you know, nighttime gaming.
[679.90 → 685.02] Those generated dungeons end up all kind of being samey.
[685.36 → 689.78] Like, there's some difference in that you don't know what's around the next corner, sort of.
[690.10 → 694.26] But there's also no flow to them.
[694.72 → 700.06] Whereas exploring in Breath of the Wild, it's art.
[700.52 → 700.78] Yes.
[700.78 → 701.60] It's artful.
[701.60 → 701.64] It's artful.
[701.84 → 708.60] You will stumble upon things because there was an intent, purposeful...
[709.60 → 713.34] Whatever.
[713.66 → 715.52] There's a narrative direction going on.
[715.66 → 719.06] There's a direction of things that you're supposed to experience when you go through different areas.
[719.06 → 722.84] And AI has an issue with hallucinations, as I...
[722.84 → 724.20] Maybe I mentioned that in the pre-show.
[725.02 → 728.38] Or getting distracted, as you just mentioned.
[728.48 → 728.68] Yeah.
[728.80 → 731.98] How they can get distracted or confused when tasks are really large.
[732.28 → 734.14] Tasking it with doing something that big.
[734.24 → 736.08] Holding that narrative the whole way through.
[736.44 → 736.88] It...
[736.88 → 737.76] Current versions?
[737.96 → 738.20] Right?
[738.26 → 739.74] Now, maybe I'm wrong in two months.
[739.80 → 740.18] I don't know.
[740.44 → 742.72] But current versions are going to struggle with that very seriously.
[742.72 → 753.30] But Skyrim style, like, you need to try to make sure that all the people have jobs that they go to every day, and they do stuff, and they react to the world.
[753.68 → 757.56] This baseline, like, NPCs that aren't technically important...
[757.56 → 759.72] Making environments feel populated...
[760.62 → 760.74] Yes.
[760.96 → 761.18] Yeah.
[761.38 → 762.22] ...is going to be...
[762.22 → 763.02] Super, perfect at that.
[763.14 → 764.58] ...totally a different game.
[764.70 → 764.90] Yeah.
[765.16 → 771.30] It's just, when it gets to dialogue, that's where I am really not sure about it.
[771.30 → 775.82] Because I don't want them to say something different if there isn't new content for me to engage with.
[776.10 → 776.28] Yeah.
[776.36 → 777.48] With that said...
[777.48 → 778.00] Don't want to waste your time.
[778.00 → 799.46] It is a matter of time before there's a game where you are just dumped into essentially an MMO that is entirely populated with AI agents that level up and quest and have jobs and build new towns for you to explore.
[799.46 → 811.32] To the point where when you go back, and you re-engage, it is new stuff and things have happened, and you do need to catch up on events, and it's happening constantly, all the time, everywhere.
[811.44 → 818.92] I mean, man, when we first started talking about Stadia and cloud gaming, I didn't realize it yet.
[818.92 → 820.42] But this.
[821.04 → 826.20] This is the kind of gaming experience that that should have enabled.
[826.40 → 827.48] Because you don't run it on.
[827.64 → 827.74] Yeah.
[827.88 → 836.92] Imagine an Escape from Markov-like experience where you are warping into, but instead of an instance, a persistent world.
[836.92 → 846.16] And then, you know, every six months or whatever it is, you do a wipe and it's a brand-new world.
[846.52 → 849.92] I feel like hardcore gameplay actually benefits from this more.
[850.26 → 853.68] Like, imagine a permanent RPG.
[855.60 → 856.08] Oh.
[856.30 → 859.16] But your effects 100% remain.
[859.16 → 865.66] And I know there's like, there's like roguelikes that go in this direction already.
[866.24 → 868.06] Someone already mentioned it, but like SAO.
[868.14 → 868.26] Yeah.
[868.30 → 872.12] If you've watched the like first half season of SAO, the good part.
[873.30 → 877.44] It's, it's kind of like the, the impacts of your previous character.
[877.56 → 884.64] Not only are they detectable as they are sometimes in like roguelike games, but they like extremely impact the world.
[884.64 → 897.94] And there's this butterfly effect where someone comes in, murders the son of some AI agent baker who swears vengeance on every player character.
[897.94 → 902.14] And there's like a plague put through the town through the bread sold at the bakery.
[902.14 → 910.54] And you could have all these different attributes that could even be slightly RNG'd that apply to these, to these NPCs.
[910.62 → 915.86] And depending on how people interact with them, they could turn into like, you could, oh man.
[915.94 → 921.12] Like you could not even assign a big baddie to this world.
[921.26 → 921.44] Yeah.
[921.44 → 927.80] There could just be many potential big baddies that form.
[928.04 → 930.66] There could be forces that are aligned against each other.
[930.66 → 940.44] And then through natural events of them, you know, wanting to gain position on each other, big baddies just are created dynamically in the world.
[941.28 → 942.84] Could be fascinating.
[943.28 → 944.44] Could be fascinating.
[944.72 → 950.00] Hideo Kojima apparently had the idea of a raw game.
[950.00 → 954.04] This is according to Float plane Chat back in 1998.
[955.34 → 958.42] And apparently it's something kind of like this.
[959.38 → 959.90] Yeah.
[960.00 → 960.82] Someday I...
[960.82 → 965.62] You can tell game developers have wanted to do this type of stuff for a long time.
[965.74 → 967.28] Well, it's one of the holy grails.
[967.46 → 972.56] It's like true physics-based object interaction.
[973.96 → 975.24] Attempts have been made.
[975.32 → 975.50] Yeah.
[975.50 → 979.58] And even games where it plays a significant role in gameplay.
[979.58 → 984.92] Whether we're talking about Rainbow Six or some of the earlier Battlefield games, destructible environments.
[985.42 → 986.62] It's been done.
[987.74 → 996.00] But nothing would be like a persistent environment where you can, you know, maybe not quite like a Minecraft or Fortnite,
[996.00 → 1000.46] but where you can build and also destroy realistically.
[1001.08 → 1002.82] Nothing like that actually exists.
[1002.96 → 1007.16] I feel like it increases how much you care about your decisions in the game.
[1007.48 → 1008.16] Because...
[1008.16 → 1008.52] Yeah.
[1008.70 → 1011.88] Your decisions in the game are going to impact your next play through.
[1011.88 → 1017.38] But in a more serious way than most games that attempt to do that right now actually will.
[1017.80 → 1019.00] The way, like...
[1019.00 → 1023.22] The way looting in towns or encampments or whatever else would work.
[1023.30 → 1029.42] Because if those agents are stealing from other player characters and from each other.
[1029.92 → 1033.84] And if there are enough AI agents that are working the land.
[1033.84 → 1037.02] You know, producing raw materials and resources.
[1037.50 → 1042.90] The world, this game world, will naturally become enriched over time.
[1043.00 → 1047.78] If you do the classic Legend of Zelda smash all the pots in, like, your favourite town.
[1048.64 → 1049.92] You could, like, bankrupt the town.
[1050.80 → 1051.28] Oh, wow.
[1051.32 → 1052.52] I didn't even, like, think of that.
[1054.76 → 1058.40] Like, you're going to have to actually not be a big jerk.
[1058.54 → 1060.80] Unless that's what you want for the world.
[1060.80 → 1062.94] Or it could be full of perfect stuff.
[1062.94 → 1064.66] Because it's secret.
[1064.80 → 1068.72] You know, after 10pm, this town is cannibal mode.
[1068.72 → 1069.98] You think they're really cool.
[1070.34 → 1076.38] But they're actually, like, stealing and cannibalizing the areas around them or whatever.
[1076.82 → 1077.02] Yeah.
[1079.98 → 1080.90] Door Fortress.
[1080.94 → 1082.44] Yeah, Door Fortress with this would be sick.
[1083.16 → 1084.02] Oh, no.
[1084.58 → 1086.20] They do have a persistent mode.
[1086.46 → 1086.64] Yeah.
[1086.64 → 1089.48] There are a lot of games that have done these types of things.
[1089.48 → 1093.92] Because I'm struggling to describe what I'm trying to say.
[1094.04 → 1097.98] But I think this is going to enable a new level of it, if you know what I mean.
[1098.02 → 1102.30] See, Dark24 and Float plane Chat says that would never work in a multiplayer game because people are trolls.
[1102.92 → 1104.24] But that's the thing.
[1104.24 → 1116.50] If you have an expansive enough world and enough of these AI agents, well, they're going to learn from the behaviour that they see.
[1116.50 → 1121.38] And you're going to create a very adversarial type of world.
[1121.92 → 1127.08] I think what you could probably do is you could tailor the gaming experience by having worlds with different rules.
[1127.08 → 1137.28] So the AI agents all start with the same basic, you know, alignments or the same basic resources or jobs or whatever else it is.
[1137.36 → 1141.38] But in some worlds, you know, there's no player versus player.
[1141.68 → 1146.42] Or in some worlds, there's no player versus good aligned NPCs.
[1146.84 → 1149.40] Or, you know, whatever these baseline rules are.
[1149.40 → 1153.90] And I think that would really alter the course of the world's development.
[1153.90 → 1158.58] And people could pick their play style based on what type of world they select to warp into.
[1159.52 → 1159.60] Yeah.
[1159.70 → 1166.20] And, like, if you're in a like, full Re-enabled world and the players do just attack everything all the time,
[1166.28 → 1172.68] it would make sense for the agents to start training themselves more aggressively, investing in armaments and whatnot.
[1172.68 → 1178.92] And if you created a world that had lesser resources in certain regions, well, those would be lower level regions.
[1179.60 → 1182.92] So you could still have, kind of similar to what you'd see in an MMO,
[1183.08 → 1190.48] you could still have a training area where PVP is disabled and, you know, all the AI agents are kind of surfs or whatever.
[1190.48 → 1196.34] You'd have to turn it off because you couldn't actually nerf the NPCs too far or else all the low level areas would just disappear.
[1196.96 → 1197.56] Yeah, exactly.
[1197.88 → 1198.10] Yeah.
[1199.98 → 1200.76] It's interesting.
[1201.48 → 1201.84] Yeah.
[1202.68 → 1207.90] So, yeah, what about ruining the game economy by selling too many materials in a town?
[1208.00 → 1210.48] Like, if you sell too much bread in a town, you could bankrupt the baker.
[1211.62 → 1213.76] Some of these types of systems already exist.
[1214.26 → 1214.42] Yeah.
[1214.78 → 1219.36] But the quake impacts of them across the world.
[1219.36 → 1222.10] I feel like it would be self-balancing to a point, right?
[1222.18 → 1231.28] Because if there's a fixed amount of resource, anytime someone amasses too much, someone's going to be gunning for them.
[1231.28 → 1236.00] Oh, so like you have like assassins coming after you or whatever.
[1236.18 → 1236.52] Yeah.
[1236.70 → 1237.42] Something like that.
[1237.50 → 1237.74] Yeah.
[1238.16 → 1240.40] If you have to actually cart your goods around.
[1241.08 → 1243.58] Oh, that's a fascinating thing.
[1243.58 → 1251.50] So, you add, you just add these like these realism counterbalances to the ways that people will try to break the game.
[1251.56 → 1254.54] And it's obviously something that will be broken in a new way every wipe.
[1254.54 → 1258.04] It would have to be really, really hard.
[1258.18 → 1258.98] It's the kind of game.
[1258.98 → 1260.44] It would have to be like realism hard.
[1260.58 → 1263.14] It's the kind of game that you could play forever.
[1263.70 → 1264.32] Yeah, pretty much.
[1265.40 → 1265.76] Yeah.
[1265.88 → 1273.04] Anyway, the discussion questions for this topic are what are the likely applications and limitations of this type of technology?
[1273.04 → 1276.88] What kind of difference would it make in people's lives if they had this kind of AI assistant?
[1278.12 → 1286.02] The most interesting like actually use it myself use case that I think I saw was that the groceries one.
[1286.96 → 1287.40] Yeah.
[1287.42 → 1292.80] Because we've talked to like there's been, oh, this fridge will like reorder milk for you or whatever.
[1293.92 → 1296.14] But that seems to have kind of gone away.
[1296.28 → 1298.12] I don't know if it didn't work that well or what.
[1298.26 → 1298.94] I mean, probably.
[1299.20 → 1301.36] But I haven't heard people talk about it in like a long time.
[1301.36 → 1304.44] They're fridges, so they were made by appliance manufacturers.
[1304.74 → 1306.04] So the software is probably trashed.
[1306.04 → 1307.60] Which should tell you how good the software was.
[1309.72 → 1316.20] But like I also know a lot of people that say like one of the most annoying things they have to do every week is like figure out what the heck they're going to eat.
[1317.98 → 1322.44] So if you can just tell it like I like these things, I need groceries for a week, and it can just figure it out for you.
[1322.64 → 1324.70] I think a lot of people would just be happy with that.
[1325.14 → 1325.52] I don't know.
[1325.76 → 1328.86] And if it can actually order the groceries for you, and they just like show up.
[1328.86 → 1333.06] And then what's great is the longer you interact with it, the better it gets.
[1333.16 → 1333.26] Yeah.
[1333.26 → 1334.92] Because you can say this was great.
[1335.04 → 1335.82] This was trash.
[1335.94 → 1337.22] This was a 7 out of 10.
[1338.32 → 1339.76] This was too hard to cook.
[1339.96 → 1342.70] This was too boring to cook if that's a metric that you care about.
[1342.88 → 1344.68] I don't have the right tools to cook this one.
[1345.52 → 1346.26] Different things like that.
[1346.26 → 1354.32] There's a lot of sort of media, whether it's games or movies, that people are pointing out is similar to what we've been talking about.
[1354.46 → 1356.22] It's pretty similar to the premise of Free Guy.
[1356.22 → 1357.04] It's a concept that's been around forever.
[1358.12 → 1361.46] What's exciting right now is that there's a path to it.
[1361.82 → 1362.10] Yeah.
[1362.10 → 1366.70] A real, realistic path to this gaming experience existing.
[1366.90 → 1368.40] Because up until now.
[1368.52 → 1370.52] At levels of depth that we haven't really seen.
[1370.62 → 1378.18] We've reached a point where creating a next generation gaming experience has become functionally impossible.
[1378.76 → 1380.02] I mean, look at the budget.
[1380.28 → 1382.76] Look at the time they spent on GTA 5.
[1383.14 → 1386.68] You know, look at how long CD Project Red was working on Cyberpunk.
[1386.88 → 1389.54] Look how long they've been working on the next generation Witcher game.
[1389.54 → 1400.00] Because to handcraft every element of the environments and interactivity and questing and items and whatever it is,
[1400.08 → 1404.82] is no longer feasible if you're trying to make a bigger game than what came last.
[1404.90 → 1409.96] Especially now that games as a service is such a pervasive concept within the industry.
[1410.48 → 1411.88] Because you don't just...
[1411.88 → 1414.84] GTA 6 doesn't just have to be bigger than GTA 5.
[1414.84 → 1422.82] It has to be bigger than GTA 5 plus the 10 flipping years of work that they've done on GTA 5 since they launched it.
[1423.80 → 1425.50] It's actually impossible.
[1425.78 → 1426.68] It's pretty ridiculous.
[1426.78 → 1427.40] You can't.
[1427.52 → 1433.10] You can't catch up to yourself who's been running for 10 years.
[1433.20 → 1436.42] There's also reward systems in games that are holding that type of stuff back.
[1436.42 → 1442.36] This is a slightly different conversation, but CSGO 2 or whatever is coming.
[1442.96 → 1445.64] I don't get access because I'm not a cool streamer person.
[1446.56 → 1453.96] But one of the first things in their announcement was talking about how, yes, don't worry, you'll be able to keep your skins.
[1455.02 → 1457.12] That doesn't work that great for every game.
[1457.32 → 1457.54] Yeah.
[1457.80 → 1459.56] It does work really well for Counter-Strike.
[1459.66 → 1461.92] Yeah, but where's my Oblivion horse armour now?
[1462.10 → 1462.44] Yeah.
[1462.84 → 1464.52] What if the next game doesn't have horses?
[1464.52 → 1476.58] And so they don't want to create, oh yeah, you don't want to create an environment where people feel like, well, I would be a whale and I would spend thousands or tens of thousands of dollars on this game.
[1476.60 → 1478.88] But there's a new one coming and I can't take my stuff with me.
[1479.16 → 1487.30] And you see the kind of backlash that developers are getting from, you know, oh, well, we're going to do a new one and forget about your old stuff.
[1487.60 → 1488.12] Oh, man.
[1488.56 → 1488.90] Shoot.
[1489.00 → 1489.54] Who was it?
[1490.04 → 1490.82] Not Overwatch.
[1491.22 → 1491.66] No.
[1491.66 → 1491.74] No.
[1494.26 → 1496.44] New version coming.
[1497.58 → 1502.12] Old version turned off game.
[1503.32 → 1503.96] Hold on.
[1504.54 → 1504.90] Crap.
[1505.44 → 1507.24] That's why Markov's wipe system is great.
[1507.34 → 1509.66] Yeah, I think it just needs to wipe.
[1509.80 → 1510.20] Is it Ark?
[1510.56 → 1511.18] Is that the one?
[1511.58 → 1511.74] Ark?
[1511.80 → 1512.78] A lot of people are saying Ark.
[1512.86 → 1513.54] I don't know much about Ark.
[1513.54 → 1524.38] Yeah, I think people are upset about Ark because they have a new one coming, and then they uploaded a remaster, or they released a remaster of the original, even though the second one is coming.
[1524.46 → 1531.56] But then they wanted to charge for the remaster, and they were going to disable access to the first one.
[1531.56 → 1541.20] So essentially it was like a forced upgrade to like Ark 1.1 when Ark 2 was coming or something like that.
[1541.58 → 1541.86] That's gross.
[1541.98 → 1542.14] Yeah.
[1542.22 → 1545.88] So that's not quite related to what we're talking about, actually, now that I think about it a bit more.
[1545.88 → 1572.24] But it's a way that game developers are going to have to figure out, or it's an example of how game developers are going to have to figure out how to manage this relationship as they rev their software, knowing that their previous games as a service either isn't gone or either is gone, and they have to figure out how to smooth that over or isn't gone, and they have to incentivize people to move on to the next thing.
[1572.24 → 1576.40] Apparently it's not just a remaster, but you have to repay for all the DLCs.
[1576.74 → 1577.16] Nice.
[1577.32 → 1578.06] That's ridiculous.
[1578.48 → 1579.68] Speaking of moving on.
[1579.78 → 1580.02] Yeah.
[1580.18 → 1582.36] Why don't we talk about our next big, oh, hold on a second.
[1582.48 → 1584.06] Do we want to jump to a non-AI?
[1584.32 → 1585.96] Riley says, Luke, look at this.
[1586.16 → 1586.50] What?
[1586.94 → 1588.86] Quote unquote, a huge deal.
[1589.40 → 1593.60] Dolly is a free open source ChatGPT style AI model.
[1594.80 → 1595.00] Yeah.
[1595.72 → 1595.94] Oh.
[1595.94 → 1603.16] So we've talked about a few different open source ChatGPT style models.
[1603.16 → 1606.88] Oh, this is just what you're talking about where you bring the whole processing load.
[1607.74 → 1608.22] Locally.
[1608.30 → 1608.50] Yeah.
[1608.50 → 1610.72] So there's a couple of these that are already out.
[1611.10 → 1617.30] I think this is literally trained off of the predecessors like Llama and Alpaca.
[1617.54 → 1621.28] I think it's just a like better, more advanced version of those.
[1621.28 → 1625.98] I haven't looked super deeply into this, but I do believe it's essentially the same deal,
[1626.12 → 1629.46] but like just much stronger than Llama and Alpaca were.
[1630.16 → 1630.74] All right.
[1631.82 → 1633.28] Let's talk about...
[1633.28 → 1635.26] Huge deal.
[1636.16 → 1636.60] Yeah.
[1636.72 → 1641.08] Like I haven't looked, I haven't like downloaded this and ran it myself yet, but as far as my
[1641.08 → 1643.90] understanding goes, it's just like a way more advanced version of those.
[1645.84 → 1646.48] All right.
[1647.38 → 1648.14] Let's do it.
[1648.50 → 1649.02] Do what?
[1649.48 → 1649.84] The one.
[1650.26 → 1650.66] The one?
[1650.66 → 1651.10] Yep.
[1651.68 → 1652.94] We have to talk about Twitter.
[1653.10 → 1654.30] We're just going straight down the list.
[1654.38 → 1654.86] Let's do it.
[1655.60 → 1657.16] Elon Musk pivots to AI.
[1658.44 → 1661.16] You know, he was talking about the app in the past.
[1661.28 → 1665.40] So if you're doing an app, then you have to chase the flavour of the month all
[1665.40 → 1665.84] the time.
[1665.88 → 1667.98] And that means right now chasing AI.
[1668.54 → 1674.52] Musk has recently hired talent from Google's subsidiary DeepMind and purchased around 10,000
[1674.52 → 1680.38] GPUs in an apparent pivot towards development of a ChatGPT rival.
[1680.38 → 1685.76] Or some other AI based thing.
[1685.76 → 1688.12] Maybe say open AI, not ChatGPT.
[1688.12 → 1689.76] At the same time, Twitter Inc.
[1689.76 → 1691.78] has been folded into X Corp.
[1692.16 → 1693.26] That's an interesting one.
[1693.50 → 1697.72] One of two corporate entities created in March alongside X.ai.
[1697.72 → 1701.90] It's unclear precisely what form this new AI project will take.
[1701.90 → 1706.30] I genuinely don't know anyone that is confident in what the heck they would be doing.
[1706.70 → 1711.52] But it likely has something to do with Elon Musk's proposed everything app, as we mentioned
[1711.52 → 1712.94] earlier, which he calls X.
[1712.94 → 1719.00] According to Musk, he wants to make the X app analogous to WeChat in terms of functionality.
[1720.10 → 1725.68] Musk has announced that Twitter slash X Corp will now be auto replying to press inquiries
[1725.68 → 1730.64] with poop emojis, making it difficult to get a straightforward comment on the future direction
[1730.64 → 1731.24] of the company.
[1731.24 → 1732.68] Very cool.
[1733.12 → 1735.12] Elon also announced Twitter subscriptions.
[1735.12 → 1741.36] Creators can charge followers for exclusive long form tweets and hours long video or shorter
[1741.36 → 1742.60] up to hours long video.
[1742.94 → 1747.48] Basically upgraded super follows with Twitter forfeiting their cut of the revenue for the
[1747.48 → 1749.84] first year, also known as a marketing budget.
[1749.98 → 1752.02] Tell me you're desperate without telling me you're desperate.
[1752.38 → 1752.58] Yeah.
[1752.58 → 1756.24] Can I pitch a theory here?
[1756.82 → 1757.02] Yeah.
[1757.60 → 1762.00] I feel like a lot of the other coverage and conversation that I've seen around this has
[1762.00 → 1765.46] been, you know, what game of 4D chess is he playing?
[1765.98 → 1772.06] You know what will be the vision for the app or whatever else it is?
[1772.68 → 1775.32] I actually think it is way simpler than that.
[1775.46 → 1777.04] Here's my cynical.
[1777.04 → 1784.58] The simplest answer is probably the correct answer theory.
[1785.32 → 1787.44] I think he wants to unload Twitter.
[1788.42 → 1791.96] So it makes sense to fold it into something else.
[1792.46 → 1794.58] So now it's X Corp.
[1794.94 → 1795.24] Okay.
[1795.36 → 1797.38] Which like is cool or something.
[1797.38 → 1808.68] I think that by tying X Corp to this everything app slash it's working on AI kind of, you know,
[1808.84 → 1815.26] BS Silicon Valley startup kind of nebulous cool factor brand.
[1815.46 → 1819.10] There's more than 2,000 AI startups in the last week, if I remember correctly.
[1819.40 → 1820.08] So it makes sense.
[1820.28 → 1820.42] Yep.
[1820.42 → 1827.82] So creating value, creating a perceived value by throwing his very loud noise making skills
[1827.82 → 1835.78] at a huge buzzword could give him an opportunity to dump Twitter before anyone realizes
[1835.78 → 1841.48] that they're not actually doing anything other than buying GPUs, which has also been in the
[1841.48 → 1845.12] headlines because Nvidia has been talking about how cryptocurrency is stupid.
[1845.42 → 1846.38] AI is our future.
[1846.54 → 1848.22] Everyone needs to buy GPUs for AI.
[1848.64 → 1849.44] We're Nvidia.
[1849.60 → 1850.00] Let's go.
[1850.42 → 1853.24] There are other processors for AI.
[1853.42 → 1856.44] I mean, Nvidia is very dominant in the space right now, but they are not going to be the
[1856.44 → 1857.20] only one forever.
[1857.64 → 1857.70] Yeah.
[1858.08 → 1861.46] So I actually think it's just the simplest.
[1861.68 → 1865.52] And, you know, why would he avoid press inquiries?
[1865.68 → 1869.26] Well, because press ask uncomfortable questions.
[1869.34 → 1870.30] Man, that interview.
[1870.94 → 1871.82] I haven't watched that.
[1872.04 → 1873.80] I've watched some clips from it.
[1873.88 → 1875.50] I've been told I should watch it, but I haven't watched it.
[1875.50 → 1875.98] It's pretty rough.
[1876.20 → 1876.68] I'm pretty busy.
[1876.68 → 1882.30] Because the press asks uncomfortable questions and doesn't just ask them, but expects a real
[1882.30 → 1883.36] well-thought-out answer.
[1883.46 → 1885.70] They're not just going to accept whatever stupid thing you say.
[1885.70 → 1894.92] So by stonewalling any serious inquiry about what's going on, he gives himself the only speaker's
[1894.92 → 1899.74] gavel or speaker's staff or, you know, whatever thing the speaker holds in this particular weird
[1899.74 → 1906.84] timeline we're on, allowing himself to build this narrative of what X Corp slash Twitter
[1906.84 → 1914.08] slash KAI actually is under this shroud of secrecy where actually it's just doing weird
[1914.08 → 1917.46] little proofs of concept with engineers it borrows from Tesla or whatever.
[1917.52 → 1923.92] And then hopefully he can find someone stupid enough to put a bunch of investment money into
[1923.92 → 1929.46] this so that he can dump his share somehow and just get the crap away from this dumpster fire.
[1929.90 → 1934.16] I think he's just, I think this is just a loss minimizing strategy.
[1934.92 → 1941.20] And I think it's, maybe it's just because I'm a very cynical person at this point, but it seems pretty,
[1941.42 → 1944.68] it seems pretty transparent to me.
[1944.68 → 1949.44] I somewhat go in line with a move that I've seen from a couple little startups recently,
[1949.58 → 1955.74] which is why that where they, they find an engineer that they feel like they can label
[1955.74 → 1960.42] as a superstar, like LLM AI machine learning engineer.
[1960.76 → 1964.00] They pay them big mega bucks to come on board.
[1964.12 → 1966.06] They buy a ton of GPUs.
[1966.12 → 1970.74] They slap a label on their project, and they just try to flip it like literally like that week.
[1970.92 → 1971.12] Yep.
[1971.12 → 1974.76] There's some, there are some flips that have been happening very, very fast.
[1974.88 → 1980.06] There's also big money in this type of engineering right now because, you know,
[1980.12 → 1981.92] Twitter buying 10,000 GPUs.
[1982.00 → 1993.10] These are expensive, like A100, big super chip, very big money, like $45,000 on eBay graphics cards right now.
[1993.24 → 1994.54] $45,000 or $4,500?
[1994.78 → 1995.58] $45,000.
[1996.86 → 1999.12] Is that just scalping that's going on right now?
[1999.12 → 1999.26] Oh yeah.
[1999.26 → 1999.96] Like is this the thing?
[1999.96 → 2000.56] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2000.56 → 2002.14] How much is a hopper?
[2005.12 → 2006.44] Let me see if I can find this.
[2006.44 → 2007.38] H100 GPU.
[2007.92 → 2008.40] Let's go.
[2009.30 → 2013.56] $42,000 for a Tesla H100.
[2013.70 → 2014.92] H100, sorry, not A100.
[2015.08 → 2015.40] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2015.40 → 2016.74] That's the last gen you're thinking of.
[2016.76 → 2017.08] My bad.
[2017.72 → 2018.18] But yeah.
[2018.60 → 2020.96] I don't think these were worth that much before.
[2021.22 → 2022.24] Yeah, probably not.
[2022.24 → 2034.50] Because the problem is a lot of these companies that, you know, some of them might just be trying to cash in on like the .com 2.0 hype kind of thing.
[2034.50 → 2041.24] Some of them also have very good ideas, and they need these GPUs to power those ideas, and they can't get them.
[2041.88 → 2043.18] They got investor money.
[2043.28 → 2044.12] They're going to get them somehow.
[2045.12 → 2045.18] Right.
[2045.84 → 2050.46] Apparently the MSRP for this one, or well, there is no MSRP for something like this.
[2050.52 → 2051.06] Yeah, I don't think you can just buy it.
[2051.06 → 2052.48] They're typically sold as integrated.
[2052.62 → 2055.74] But apparently the price for these is typically around $35,000.
[2056.00 → 2056.46] Oh, okay.
[2056.64 → 2059.56] I mean, it's still marked up by $7,000.
[2061.30 → 2061.74] Yeah.
[2062.18 → 2063.88] And there aren't even many available.
[2064.26 → 2064.46] Yeah.
[2065.56 → 2066.00] Okay.
[2066.28 → 2066.68] Sure.
[2067.82 → 2070.92] So it's been pretty intense.
[2071.44 → 2071.98] So, right.
[2072.06 → 2076.42] What I was saying was there's actually a lot of money right now in being an engineer that can work on this stuff,
[2076.84 → 2080.62] especially if you can be super efficient with it.
[2081.36 → 2089.08] Because if you can reduce the cost of GPUs and the cost of continually processing on those GPUs that you need to have,
[2089.50 → 2091.92] that's very beneficial for companies right now.
[2092.98 → 2101.00] OpenAI has been talking about how they don't actually believe a lot of these models need to be trained on bigger data sets.
[2101.76 → 2102.66] Oh, interesting.
[2102.78 → 2104.12] And that they're not actually...
[2104.12 → 2105.12] Do they just need cleaner data sets or...
[2105.72 → 2108.08] Potentially cleaner, potentially better at parsing them,
[2108.08 → 2112.98] potentially better systems powering the actual chat module, stuff like that.
[2113.30 → 2116.30] They've said that they're not actually working on GPT-5 right now.
[2117.00 → 2124.46] And they think it is more beneficial, and they will step forward faster if they work on supporting tools for what they already have.
[2124.86 → 2126.88] Which honestly kind of makes sense to me.
[2126.88 → 2136.12] Because when you're talking about it like the previous topic where we mentioned that it will get distracted or confused with complex goals,
[2136.12 → 2144.40] well, okay, it might be more productive to work on keeping it on task by teaching it how to, you know,
[2144.46 → 2148.12] break apart problems and compartmentalize parts of it like you do with like...
[2148.42 → 2151.52] Like humans do, to be completely honest.
[2151.52 → 2157.30] If you get this massive complicated task, instead of trying to tackle the entire thing as one big unit,
[2157.50 → 2163.84] you often break it down into smaller things so that you can easily, more easily tackle it and keep yourself focused.
[2164.06 → 2171.52] Well, working on things like that might actually be more beneficial and get you to higher perceived performance and power faster...
[2172.04 → 2172.26] Right.
[2172.40 → 2175.16] ...than just training a bigger model that's going to have the same problem.
[2176.66 → 2177.90] So, yeah.
[2177.90 → 2181.32] I also want to talk about LinkedIn Verified.
[2181.80 → 2182.04] Yeah.
[2182.66 → 2193.58] Speaking of everything apps, LinkedIn has gone from somewhere that you go just for the exclusive purpose of updating your resume when you're looking for a job
[2193.58 → 2197.90] to, as far as I can tell, the primary social network for...
[2199.72 → 2203.24] I'm just trying to think.
[2203.24 → 2211.02] Probably most of the working adults that I know.
[2211.26 → 2213.98] Like, and I don't mean I'm aware of.
[2214.10 → 2218.08] Like, I'm not talking about people that I've added a couple of times on Twitter or whatever else.
[2218.08 → 2220.14] I'm talking about people that I know who mostly...
[2220.14 → 2221.14] I...
[2221.14 → 2222.24] Only work.
[2222.58 → 2225.50] So, I mean, most of the people I know are through work.
[2225.50 → 2233.54] Like, the amount of just sort of random crap posting on LinkedIn and just life updates people are posting on there.
[2233.84 → 2235.52] How active it is.
[2236.20 → 2238.64] Because I don't really engage with it.
[2238.70 → 2246.50] So, almost everyone that I'm connected with on LinkedIn is someone that I added over 10 years ago back when I was updating my resume.
[2246.76 → 2248.54] Because I was looking for a job, right?
[2248.54 → 2249.88] Like, that's how I used it.
[2250.14 → 2252.54] But the way that it's used has evolved so much now.
[2252.66 → 2255.00] And this is cool.
[2255.22 → 2257.38] They're rolling out a verification program.
[2257.72 → 2267.06] So, it looks like by confirming users' identities and their workplace, it's going to start to work kind of like blind.
[2267.06 → 2275.64] So, in addition to being a social network that you just generally engage with your professional circle through.
[2275.88 → 2280.12] And then just apparently engage with just about anybody based on the messages I get on LinkedIn.
[2280.44 → 2290.10] It's going to become more like a private version of your own internal work chat slash board slash Slack.
[2291.00 → 2292.22] I mean, it's owned by Microsoft.
[2292.40 → 2293.10] So, it might...
[2293.10 → 2294.54] It could tie into Teams even if you wanted.
[2294.54 → 2306.44] But without the filter of being worried that your system administrator or your boss is going to archive and read any message that you post.
[2306.54 → 2308.04] Until LinkedIn has a data breach.
[2308.46 → 2310.00] Until LinkedIn has a breach.
[2310.08 → 2312.20] I mean, you just said, owned by Microsoft?
[2312.42 → 2315.70] When's the last time Microsoft had a major user data breach?
[2315.70 → 2315.88] That's fair enough.
[2315.94 → 2318.00] But nobody's like impenetrable.
[2318.18 → 2320.54] Hey, we're not saying it's impossible.
[2321.50 → 2322.14] But that is fair.
[2322.34 → 2324.50] Microsoft has been pretty solid for quite a while now.
[2324.54 → 2327.48] So, they're going to send a security code through your work email.
[2327.62 → 2330.28] So, they'll actually verify the domain of your workplace.
[2330.42 → 2332.44] Make sure that you have a functioning email.
[2332.62 → 2333.10] That makes sense.
[2333.18 → 2338.16] And even have people submit their government ID to a third-party verification service.
[2338.42 → 2341.20] This is basically what Google tried to do with Google+.
[2341.20 → 2346.12] I barely remember how Google Plus functioned, to be completely honest.
[2346.12 → 2346.76] Google Plus.
[2346.84 → 2348.42] The concept was circles.
[2348.42 → 2348.70] Circles.
[2349.00 → 2349.14] Yeah.
[2349.20 → 2349.46] Okay.
[2349.52 → 2350.12] For one thing.
[2350.24 → 2353.46] And we're not going back to circles.
[2353.64 → 2359.36] But also, you know, creating, you know, pods of, well, here's my professional network.
[2359.46 → 2360.66] Here's, you know, whatever else.
[2360.66 → 2363.96] I think that you could easily use it this way if you really wanted to.
[2363.96 → 2370.50] But the big one was when they integrated Google Plus with YouTube was they wanted to cut down on spam.
[2371.42 → 2372.62] Apparently, Azure just had a breach.
[2373.18 → 2374.28] Oh, awesome.
[2375.56 → 2376.48] Are you kidding me?
[2376.48 → 2376.66] Okay.
[2376.66 → 2377.24] Great timing.
[2378.06 → 2378.62] Okay.
[2378.80 → 2380.24] So, your data won't be safe.
[2380.40 → 2390.84] But, hey, at least you can send snarky messages about, you know, Jeff from accounting to Sue from, you know, logistics or whatever else.
[2391.26 → 2392.88] Anyway, that doesn't change my point.
[2392.98 → 2395.44] The point is that YouTube was attempting to...
[2395.44 → 2395.94] Not that recently.
[2396.62 → 2405.46] ...to moderate the conversations that were occurring on YouTube by having everyone verify their identity, use real identities.
[2405.46 → 2413.70] And Facebook tried to do something very similar when they cracked down on people having just sort of nonsense profile names and had people...
[2413.70 → 2416.08] They restricted your ability to change your name all the time.
[2416.18 → 2417.50] They had you actually submit.
[2418.04 → 2422.72] It would call you on it if you submitted something that didn't sound like a real enough name.
[2424.08 → 2428.36] It feels like we frogs have been kind of...
[2428.36 → 2430.38] Like, remember Bob and his tank army?
[2430.38 → 2436.84] When Google integrated YouTube and Google Plus and wanted everybody to use real identities?
[2437.16 → 2440.12] The kind of rebellion that took place on the internet?
[2440.56 → 2445.82] And now, I'm even looking at this going, this is kind of...
[2445.82 → 2447.56] This feels like a feature.
[2447.76 → 2451.76] This is apparently part of an effort to crack down on fraud and impersonation on the site,
[2451.76 → 2453.70] which would be...
[2453.70 → 2456.34] Which would legitimately make it a much better experience,
[2456.34 → 2460.28] which isn't really different from what Google was trying to do.
[2460.36 → 2461.06] Would we have this?
[2461.06 → 2461.28] I think it is.
[2461.36 → 2461.80] I think it is.
[2461.92 → 2464.82] I was actually having this conversation with some friends literally last night.
[2465.44 → 2468.78] Not this exact one, but about your frogs comment.
[2469.20 → 2469.44] Sure.
[2469.54 → 2471.96] About how a lot of people have just kind of given up on privacy,
[2472.30 → 2474.20] when that used to be a huge conversation.
[2474.20 → 2478.18] And genuinely a massive percentage of the population is like,
[2478.24 → 2481.70] yeah, I'll just have like Amazon Echoes all around my house and ring doorbells and whatever,
[2481.80 → 2482.24] and I don't care.
[2483.48 → 2489.20] I think this is a little bit different because LinkedIn has never been anonymous.
[2490.34 → 2490.74] Yeah.
[2491.18 → 2494.30] And Google or YouTube comments and all that kind of stuff,
[2494.44 → 2496.76] they were anonymous and then that was taken away.
[2497.10 → 2499.18] LinkedIn's like whole purpose was like,
[2499.34 → 2501.08] look, this is who I am.
[2501.32 → 2502.18] This is my name.
[2502.32 → 2503.26] This is where I work.
[2503.26 → 2504.68] This is everything I've ever done.
[2504.76 → 2505.72] All that kind of stuff.
[2505.80 → 2508.96] So I don't feel like it's really a change of tone for the platform.
[2509.24 → 2514.08] So is it just a change in attitude for the user that they enjoy and appreciate
[2514.08 → 2517.02] the more meaningful interactions they have on this platform?
[2517.16 → 2518.18] I could definitely see that being a thing.
[2518.20 → 2520.02] And are gravitating towards using it,
[2520.12 → 2524.12] even if they're not really thinking about why it works so much better.
[2524.24 → 2526.46] It could be that in this like era of the internet,
[2526.46 → 2528.50] we're now kind of separating,
[2528.62 → 2532.46] like the same person might still want their anonymity on Twitter
[2532.46 → 2534.68] or YouTube comments or whatever else,
[2534.80 → 2537.26] but then want to have more direct,
[2537.64 → 2541.06] know the person you're talking to conversations on another platform somewhere else,
[2541.06 → 2542.08] like potentially LinkedIn.
[2542.46 → 2543.98] I could totally see that being a thing.
[2544.08 → 2547.96] I would have to purge my LinkedIn because I just like ruined it.
[2547.96 → 2549.12] I'm going to go to Luke's LinkedIn.
[2549.34 → 2550.38] At some point in time,
[2550.38 → 2552.16] I just like added everyone.
[2552.84 → 2553.20] Oh.
[2553.20 → 2556.00] Were you job searching?
[2556.74 → 2559.42] Did it seem like we were going through a rough patch?
[2559.58 → 2559.72] Oh,
[2559.76 → 2561.38] I think this was when you were doing it too.
[2561.46 → 2562.92] I think we were both in panic mode.
[2563.18 → 2564.46] I think I've updated my picture.
[2564.54 → 2564.66] Now,
[2564.70 → 2565.32] hold on a second.
[2565.46 → 2566.02] You actually,
[2566.20 → 2567.14] no,
[2567.30 → 2567.54] you haven't.
[2567.54 → 2569.62] That's ancient.
[2570.76 → 2571.70] Is that from Taiwan?
[2572.18 → 2573.52] I actually don't know.
[2573.72 → 2575.20] Brandon clearly took that,
[2575.56 → 2576.52] but I don't know where we were.
[2576.56 → 2577.48] That's got to be in Taiwan.
[2577.94 → 2578.16] You've,
[2578.16 → 2579.30] you've updated it recently.
[2579.30 → 2582.46] I updated it slightly because so many people were contacting me.
[2582.46 → 2583.94] So you're LinkedIn for work.
[2584.02 → 2584.84] You're all over that.
[2584.90 → 2585.98] You're all over that LinkedIn.
[2586.24 → 2586.40] No,
[2586.44 → 2587.62] because they wanted jobs here.
[2587.72 → 2587.84] Yeah,
[2587.88 → 2588.58] because you,
[2588.74 → 2589.00] you know,
[2589.10 → 2589.86] updated your,
[2590.00 → 2590.78] updated your title.
[2590.98 → 2591.34] So no,
[2591.34 → 2591.50] no,
[2591.50 → 2591.62] no,
[2591.62 → 2591.74] no,
[2591.74 → 2591.80] no,
[2591.80 → 2591.82] no,
[2591.82 → 2591.88] no,
[2591.88 → 2591.92] no,
[2591.92 → 2591.94] no,
[2591.94 → 2592.20] no,
[2592.20 → 2592.22] no,
[2592.22 → 2592.28] no,
[2592.28 → 2592.88] no,
[2592.88 → 2593.68] last time.
[2593.96 → 2594.28] Oh,
[2594.88 → 2596.00] no,
[2596.04 → 2596.78] that's ancient.
[2597.12 → 2597.24] Oh,
[2597.26 → 2597.60] I see.
[2597.86 → 2598.08] Yeah.
[2599.22 → 2599.42] Yeah.
[2599.46 → 2599.60] Yeah.
[2599.60 → 2599.78] Yeah.
[2600.22 → 2601.96] 500 plus connection.
[2602.02 → 2602.16] Yeah.
[2602.18 → 2602.82] I ruined it.
[2603.14 → 2604.30] Good gravy.
[2604.56 → 2605.98] It's like a lot more than that too.
[2606.56 → 2606.92] Huh?
[2607.22 → 2608.28] That's just what they display.
[2608.30 → 2608.32] Wow.
[2608.32 → 2609.08] Cool certification,
[2609.28 → 2609.42] bro.
[2609.50 → 2609.64] Hey,
[2609.66 → 2610.04] it's real.
[2610.18 → 2610.70] I got it.
[2610.98 → 2611.42] I mean,
[2611.50 → 2611.78] yeah,
[2611.78 → 2612.40] I guess so.
[2612.56 → 2612.80] Yep.
[2613.70 → 2614.06] Neat.
[2614.48 → 2614.84] Oh,
[2614.88 → 2616.08] this was while you were working here.
[2616.18 → 2616.28] Did,
[2616.28 → 2616.48] did,
[2616.54 → 2617.22] did I pay for that?
[2617.24 → 2617.74] You don't remember that?
[2617.78 → 2617.86] No,
[2617.90 → 2618.28] you didn't.
[2618.36 → 2618.50] Oh,
[2618.54 → 2618.72] okay.
[2618.86 → 2619.08] Wow.
[2619.14 → 2619.64] You should have,
[2619.66 → 2619.92] uh,
[2620.08 → 2620.80] had me pay for that.
[2620.80 → 2622.66] It was well before we had that program.
[2622.76 → 2622.90] Oh,
[2622.92 → 2623.40] that makes sense.
[2624.14 → 2624.30] Uh,
[2624.34 → 2624.54] yeah,
[2624.62 → 2624.90] okay,
[2625.00 → 2625.12] no,
[2625.18 → 2625.32] wait,
[2625.40 → 2625.50] this,
[2625.78 → 2626.04] oh yeah,
[2626.08 → 2626.68] we didn't have any money.
[2626.90 → 2627.14] No.
[2628.54 → 2628.90] Right,
[2628.98 → 2631.36] this is when you kept talking about gamifying the forum.
[2631.52 → 2631.66] Yeah.
[2631.70 → 2632.66] Then you wouldn't shut up about it.
[2632.66 → 2633.86] It's because you took this course.
[2633.96 → 2634.12] Yeah.
[2634.88 → 2635.46] Got it.
[2635.54 → 2635.86] Okay.
[2636.20 → 2636.34] Yeah.
[2636.78 → 2637.02] So,
[2637.16 → 2640.74] what's the point of listing your University of Victoria education?
[2640.74 → 2641.66] When I didn't finish it?
[2641.70 → 2644.32] When it's very clear from the date range that you,
[2644.36 → 2644.68] uh,
[2644.84 → 2646.74] did not complete.
[2647.14 → 2647.30] Well,
[2647.30 → 2648.40] I didn't finish the other one either.
[2649.30 → 2649.70] Yeah.
[2650.80 → 2653.06] That doesn't really answer my question at all.
[2653.18 → 2654.20] Did you include yours?
[2654.40 → 2654.74] I'm,
[2654.80 → 2655.54] I'm checking.
[2655.98 → 2657.40] Cause if I'm going to shame you,
[2657.50 → 2659.98] then I guess I better check my own ship over here.
[2660.12 → 2661.36] You got your secondary school.
[2661.56 → 2661.78] Uh,
[2662.36 → 2662.88] oh,
[2663.66 → 2665.02] yeah,
[2665.20 → 2666.26] that's pretty cringe.
[2666.66 → 2666.92] Um,
[2667.08 → 2669.32] I don't know if that's better,
[2669.56 → 2669.94] to be honest.
[2670.20 → 2670.60] Founder,
[2670.92 → 2671.48] uh,
[2671.64 → 2672.72] committed to delivering fun.
[2672.72 → 2673.22] YouTube video,
[2673.46 → 2675.30] social media project coordinator.
[2675.76 → 2676.14] Mm-hmm.
[2676.14 → 2676.82] What a title.
[2677.04 → 2677.96] I made it up,
[2678.02 → 2678.16] right?
[2678.22 → 2678.60] Obviously.
[2678.60 → 2678.86] Like,
[2678.90 → 2679.76] I didn't have a title.
[2680.36 → 2685.00] I don't think I ever got a formal promotion the entire time I worked at NCI,
[2685.20 → 2686.66] but I definitely got paid a lot more.
[2686.82 → 2686.96] So,
[2687.14 → 2689.04] I gave myself my own title.
[2689.12 → 2690.48] Everyone kind of picked their own title there.
[2690.58 → 2690.70] So,
[2690.78 → 2690.94] whatever.
[2691.28 → 2691.44] Yeah.
[2692.12 → 2692.52] Um,
[2692.94 → 2694.40] retail sales representative,
[2695.16 → 2696.24] student works painting,
[2696.78 → 2697.38] lifeguarding,
[2697.48 → 2698.32] day camp counsellor.
[2698.48 → 2698.58] Yeah,
[2698.60 → 2698.92] I got my,
[2699.06 → 2699.52] no,
[2700.06 → 2702.34] I didn't put university on there because,
[2702.34 → 2702.86] how long were you there?
[2703.30 → 2703.66] Because,
[2703.96 → 2706.54] I didn't get a degree and I didn't get a diploma.
[2706.72 → 2706.86] So,
[2707.00 → 2707.84] I only counted,
[2708.56 → 2709.32] I only counted.
[2709.32 → 2710.50] You have Fast as Possible on there?
[2710.84 → 2711.32] I have what?
[2711.44 → 2711.54] Whoa,
[2711.54 → 2711.64] whoa,
[2711.64 → 2711.92] hold on.
[2711.94 → 2713.06] When did you update this?
[2713.12 → 2713.46] Hold on,
[2713.54 → 2713.84] hold on.
[2713.90 → 2714.30] I have what?
[2714.36 → 2714.46] Sorry?
[2714.50 → 2715.24] Go down further.
[2716.04 → 2716.16] Down,
[2716.22 → 2716.32] down,
[2716.32 → 2716.42] down,
[2716.42 → 2716.54] down,
[2716.54 → 2716.68] down,
[2716.68 → 2717.32] down,
[2717.32 → 2717.50] down,
[2717.50 → 2717.70] down,
[2717.70 → 2717.92] down,
[2717.92 → 2718.28] down,
[2718.28 → 2718.82] down,
[2718.82 → 2718.96] down,
[2718.96 → 2719.08] down,
[2719.08 → 2719.18] down,
[2719.18 → 2719.36] down,
[2719.36 → 2719.88] keep going,
[2719.94 → 2720.18] keep going,
[2720.22 → 2720.48] keep going,
[2720.52 → 2720.80] keep going,
[2721.20 → 2721.54] keep going.
[2722.08 → 2722.44] Publications,
[2722.54 → 2723.20] Fast as Possible,
[2723.30 → 2724.64] NCI executives,
[2729.52 → 2730.76] officially started.
[2731.08 → 2731.64] Because remember,
[2731.76 → 2733.88] the idea behind it was that it was going to be,
[2733.88 → 2734.52] I don't remember it was that soon.
[2734.72 → 2734.90] Yeah,
[2735.28 → 2735.52] yeah,
[2735.62 → 2744.32] Fast as Possible was so important because it was going to be the vehicle by which we were going to get way more views on our paid video production work for brands.
[2744.80 → 2746.18] We were going to create this channel.
[2746.50 → 2746.78] Oh,
[2746.86 → 2747.36] yeah.
[2747.46 → 2751.24] That was little explainers to get people subscribed and get momentum.
[2751.84 → 2758.80] And then it was going to also be just like fully paid videos for, you know, Corsair or Samsung or whatever the case may be.
[2758.80 → 2767.64] I would totally stupid plan based on how YouTube works now where it's a lot more important how good the quality of the video is and a lot less important how many subscribers you have.
[2767.84 → 2770.98] But it seemed like kind of a good idea at the time.
[2773.10 → 2773.50] Yeah,
[2773.58 → 2775.28] we started it pretty much right away.
[2775.38 → 2785.88] And it was also at a time when pretty much everyone on YouTube had a secondary channel of some sort, you know, whether it was a vlog channel or behind the scenes channel or like.
[2786.04 → 2787.44] Even a lot of them were just called like two.
[2787.44 → 2788.12] Cooking streams.
[2788.22 → 2788.38] Yeah.
[2788.50 → 2788.66] Yeah.
[2788.76 → 2788.94] Just,
[2789.04 → 2789.54] just two.
[2789.70 → 2789.86] Yeah.
[2789.94 → 2790.88] So I wanted,
[2791.12 → 2793.62] I wanted some kind of second identity,
[2793.62 → 2797.94] whether it was if the main channel went down or stopped growing or.
[2798.76 → 2800.26] Something I discovered very recently,
[2800.26 → 2801.24] this is super off-topic,
[2801.24 → 2804.46] but that there are a bunch of channels that just mirror themselves.
[2805.08 → 2806.96] They'll have another channel of a same,
[2807.14 → 2807.32] similar,
[2807.32 → 2810.78] or even completely different name that has all the same content.
[2810.78 → 2817.50] And really some people that do that have gotten mad because YouTube is like gotten rid of their channel,
[2817.78 → 2819.84] their additional channel because of impersonation.
[2820.22 → 2820.90] But they're like,
[2820.96 → 2821.06] no,
[2821.08 → 2821.18] wait,
[2821.20 → 2821.58] that's me.
[2822.94 → 2823.68] I was like,
[2823.76 → 2825.24] I had no idea.
[2825.30 → 2826.32] This was a thing that people did.
[2826.88 → 2827.28] Interesting.
[2827.74 → 2830.96] Apparently they do it not actually for like algorithmic gains.
[2831.22 → 2832.64] They don't promote the other channel.
[2832.78 → 2832.86] Okay.
[2832.94 → 2833.70] That's what I would have assumed.
[2833.70 → 2837.00] They do it so that if the first channel just gets deleted,
[2837.12 → 2839.56] they have the second one still.
[2839.80 → 2841.80] So if they get like content strikes on one of them,
[2841.84 → 2844.34] they can survive and just remove the chance,
[2844.48 → 2846.58] remove the videos that they got the content strikes from,
[2846.70 → 2848.22] and then just keep going.
[2848.22 → 2852.76] At least that's what the like one person I saw talking about it.
[2852.82 → 2853.22] I'm sorry.
[2853.26 → 2853.84] I don't believe that.
[2853.84 → 2854.84] That might not be real.
[2854.92 → 2855.30] I don't know.
[2855.76 → 2858.80] I just saw one person commenting about that's how that's what they do.
[2859.58 → 2861.58] That's interesting.
[2862.80 → 2863.40] But yeah.
[2863.46 → 2863.72] Okay.
[2863.98 → 2864.82] Do we need to move on?
[2865.12 → 2867.72] Explain merch messages is our current thing.
[2868.08 → 2868.34] Yeah.
[2868.46 → 2868.70] Oh,
[2868.80 → 2869.04] okay.
[2869.10 → 2869.42] Right.
[2869.58 → 2873.70] So we're trying to make the show a little more structured.
[2873.96 → 2876.26] We had a five-hour WAN show last week,
[2876.26 → 2877.44] which was A,
[2877.52 → 2878.74] a lot and B,
[2878.88 → 2881.20] not even remotely feasible today,
[2881.28 → 2883.00] given how late we ended up starting.
[2883.32 → 2887.40] So Dan is trying to kind of keep us in line here.
[2887.58 → 2889.62] If you guys are not familiar yet,
[2889.82 → 2892.38] merch messages are the way to interact with the show.
[2892.76 → 2896.32] Send little messages that pop up in the bottom to your friends or your mom,
[2896.42 → 2897.66] assuming your mom watches the WAN show.
[2897.74 → 2898.86] So you can send a merch message.
[2898.94 → 2901.12] You're the only person whose mom I know watches the WAN show.
[2901.74 → 2905.62] It also allows you to send in topic suggestions,
[2905.62 → 2906.06] just,
[2906.18 → 2906.40] you know,
[2906.46 → 2907.72] generally show some love.
[2908.04 → 2912.06] It's a better way to interact with the show because unlike a Twitch bit or a super chat or
[2912.06 → 2913.70] whatever else the case may be,
[2914.08 → 2916.54] a merch message might not get a response.
[2916.68 → 2917.40] We do our best,
[2917.84 → 2919.18] but even if it doesn't,
[2919.28 → 2925.30] you will get your order in the mail in however long it takes to get to America or Timbuktu or
[2925.30 → 2927.70] Australia or wherever it happens to be that you live,
[2927.96 → 2930.02] or if you're buying a gift for someone else.
[2930.02 → 2932.98] So why don't we do a couple of merch messages to kind of,
[2933.10 → 2933.22] oh,
[2933.30 → 2933.48] right.
[2933.90 → 2937.02] The way it works is you go on ltdstore.com and in the checkout,
[2937.24 → 2938.26] you'll see a little box.
[2938.38 → 2939.00] Whenever we're live,
[2939.06 → 2942.38] there's a box where you can fill in your merch message, and it'll go into a queue to be sorted
[2942.38 → 2943.72] by producer Dan.
[2945.68 → 2946.02] Dan,
[2946.08 → 2948.34] do you want to hit us with a couple of merch messages, and then we'll move on to our next
[2948.34 → 2948.56] topic?
[2948.56 → 2949.36] I do.
[2949.50 → 2950.86] I've got a couple of good ones here for you.
[2951.20 → 2952.98] First up is from Adrian.
[2953.32 → 2956.58] If LMG didn't exist, and you could choose to do whatever you wanted,
[2956.74 → 2958.84] where would you work and in what position?
[2960.58 → 2960.96] Well,
[2961.02 → 2963.16] the position would definitely be on all fours.
[2965.40 → 2965.80] Okay.
[2965.88 → 2965.98] No,
[2966.00 → 2966.24] hold on,
[2966.28 → 2966.52] hold on.
[2968.02 → 2968.42] Okay.
[2969.18 → 2971.06] I'm going to answer this two different ways.
[2971.76 → 2973.54] I'm going to answer without the
[2973.68 → 2975.68] if you could choose to do whatever you wanted.
[2975.68 → 2976.70] Um,
[2977.14 → 2978.74] if LMG didn't exist,
[2978.74 → 2983.44] probably it would have collapsed around the first three to six months.
[2983.62 → 2985.54] And I had a pretty solid job.
[2985.72 → 2986.34] Never started.
[2986.58 → 2986.86] Yeah.
[2986.94 → 2989.22] I had a pretty solid job offer at,
[2989.22 → 2989.82] um,
[2989.88 → 2990.72] Western Digital.
[2990.94 → 2991.66] I remember that.
[2991.82 → 2992.88] And like,
[2992.90 → 2993.56] it was like,
[2993.58 → 3000.72] it looked pretty good compared to the constant existential crisis.
[3000.72 → 3003.08] That was Linus media group at that time.
[3003.18 → 3003.72] I,
[3003.82 → 3003.94] it,
[3003.94 → 3006.46] I was thinking about it seriously enough.
[3006.46 → 3006.76] Like I,
[3006.80 → 3007.26] I never,
[3007.74 → 3008.90] I always told them no.
[3009.14 → 3009.54] Right.
[3009.64 → 3011.30] But I was thinking about it enough.
[3011.74 → 3015.16] It was troubling me enough that I did talk to Luke and Ed about it.
[3015.48 → 3015.88] It was like,
[3016.04 → 3016.24] Hey,
[3016.30 → 3017.46] so this is like a thing.
[3018.16 → 3018.56] Um,
[3018.58 → 3018.94] it was fun.
[3019.00 → 3022.90] Because I lived with him at the time and I had abandoned both Ed and I had
[3022.90 → 3024.94] completely abandoned our educational prospects,
[3024.94 → 3028.66] which we were both doing very well with in order to start this company.
[3028.66 → 3029.82] And then after we did that,
[3029.88 → 3034.36] he was talking to us, and I was hearing him and Yvonne update his LinkedIn
[3034.36 → 3036.94] profile so he could get a different job and abandon this project.
[3037.02 → 3037.22] That was,
[3037.34 → 3038.44] that was a very cool era.
[3038.56 → 3040.00] When did I update my LinkedIn profile?
[3040.14 → 3042.78] I was already living with you, and we were working on this.
[3043.12 → 3046.10] Are you sure you're updating your LinkedIn because of the WD thing?
[3046.10 → 3050.28] I thought,
[3050.54 → 3051.08] see,
[3051.20 → 3056.62] I remember writing all of this stuff on my LinkedIn profile in my office when
[3056.62 → 3059.46] I was still at NCI because I gave them like six months.
[3059.60 → 3059.72] Oh,
[3059.74 → 3060.84] you might've also done that.
[3061.18 → 3061.42] Oh,
[3061.48 → 3061.72] okay.
[3061.76 → 3062.14] I don't know.
[3062.22 → 3062.34] Yeah.
[3062.38 → 3062.72] I think,
[3063.14 → 3063.40] yeah,
[3063.46 → 3063.82] I don't know.
[3063.82 → 3065.54] I'm not saying it was exclusively at that time.
[3065.60 → 3065.88] Okay.
[3065.96 → 3066.14] I,
[3066.14 → 3066.36] I,
[3066.42 → 3068.00] I can tell you I didn't update much.
[3068.26 → 3072.56] I know because I updated my LinkedIn before I left because I wanted to be
[3072.56 → 3075.68] able to check a bunch of numbers while I still had access to the
[3075.68 → 3076.30] internal system.
[3076.62 → 3079.64] How much did I grow the revenue on this line from when to when?
[3079.72 → 3080.22] So I did,
[3080.30 → 3082.12] I did the vast majority of that.
[3082.32 → 3084.06] It was communicated as a
[3084.20 → 3084.42] like,
[3085.08 → 3086.98] if this does burn,
[3087.50 → 3089.02] this is my plan,
[3089.42 → 3090.98] but the plan is for it to not burn.
[3091.10 → 3092.12] And I did talk to you.
[3092.18 → 3092.66] And that was,
[3092.76 → 3092.96] I mean,
[3092.98 → 3093.84] I was open about it.
[3093.84 → 3094.78] I would rather know.
[3094.92 → 3095.36] So like,
[3095.36 → 3095.68] I'm not,
[3095.74 → 3096.08] I'm not,
[3096.14 → 3097.14] I'm not mad about it.
[3097.16 → 3098.50] It was just a spicy moment.
[3098.66 → 3099.10] That's all.
[3099.24 → 3099.40] Yeah.
[3100.16 → 3100.56] Hey,
[3100.68 → 3100.86] Hey,
[3100.88 → 3101.58] we made it.
[3102.40 → 3103.34] We made it.
[3103.76 → 3104.16] Yeah.
[3105.10 → 3105.66] And like,
[3105.68 → 3106.42] it wasn't like,
[3106.56 → 3109.78] it wasn't like I wasn't considering what I would do.
[3110.02 → 3110.26] Yeah.
[3110.38 → 3111.06] If it burnt as well.
[3111.18 → 3111.44] Like,
[3111.50 → 3111.64] I,
[3111.74 → 3112.22] I don't know.
[3112.30 → 3113.24] I don't know if Ed was.
[3113.90 → 3114.40] I'm not sure.
[3114.50 → 3117.82] I think he just had no plan.
[3118.94 → 3119.42] It's like,
[3119.48 → 3119.68] no,
[3119.74 → 3119.84] no,
[3119.84 → 3119.94] no.
[3120.12 → 3120.48] It's cool.
[3120.58 → 3121.32] It kind of sucks.
[3122.32 → 3123.12] Maybe it's pointless.
[3123.26 → 3123.52] I don't know.
[3123.56 → 3124.10] Just not do that.
[3125.80 → 3126.84] He probably would have been fine.
[3126.92 → 3128.98] So I had tried to apply to Amazon.
[3128.98 → 3130.94] So that was clearly something that I wanted to do.
[3131.06 → 3132.12] I didn't get the job at Amazon.
[3132.12 → 3136.38] So I went full bore into getting Linus media group started.
[3136.60 → 3139.74] And then shortly into Linus media group,
[3139.88 → 3141.34] I got the offer from WD.
[3141.46 → 3147.12] That was probably the best offer that I got and might've catapulted me into some kind of
[3147.12 → 3149.46] marketing position somewhere else.
[3149.46 → 3150.92] Would I have ended up?
[3151.98 → 3152.84] I would have,
[3153.06 → 3155.20] if I had gotten desperate enough,
[3155.62 → 3156.66] Paul and Kyle,
[3156.78 → 3159.48] I think had already split from new egg at this point.
[3159.62 → 3160.86] I'm not a hundred percent sure,
[3161.50 → 3164.10] but just like running and joining the video team there.
[3164.16 → 3164.90] I don't think they had,
[3165.06 → 3166.18] I think they were still there,
[3166.24 → 3168.48] but if I had applied,
[3168.60 → 3169.70] I'm sure I could have,
[3169.76 → 3170.12] you know,
[3170.14 → 3171.10] become a host there.
[3171.18 → 3173.96] That was an option that I was turning over in my mind.
[3174.18 → 3175.34] There was some plan.
[3176.10 → 3176.82] Oh man.
[3177.10 → 3178.66] I don't know if I'm hallucinating this or not.
[3178.66 → 3180.50] I think there was some plan.
[3180.60 → 3181.30] Are you ChatGPT?
[3182.40 → 3187.40] I think there was some plan at some point that we had talked about where if it didn't work,
[3187.48 → 3189.54] you and I were both going to go somewhere.
[3190.02 → 3190.78] I don't remember where.
[3190.78 → 3190.80] No,
[3190.80 → 3201.40] I told you that one of the conditions that I had given to WD in the very short conversations was that I wanted to be able to bring my team with me because they wanted me to do some video stuff there in some capacity.
[3202.10 → 3202.50] So that.
[3203.34 → 3204.16] Maybe that was it.
[3204.36 → 3204.58] I don't,
[3204.64 → 3205.32] it's been a long,
[3205.38 → 3207.30] it's actually genuinely been a very long time.
[3207.30 → 3207.56] It's been 10 years.
[3207.66 → 3207.82] Yeah.
[3208.04 → 3208.24] Yeah.
[3208.24 → 3211.62] It's hard to remember the exact details of the conversations.
[3211.98 → 3212.10] Yeah.
[3212.20 → 3212.42] So,
[3212.66 → 3214.42] so if I recall correctly,
[3214.42 → 3215.26] they weren't that,
[3215.60 → 3216.40] they weren't that.
[3216.70 → 3217.38] Enthused on that.
[3217.40 → 3217.56] Yeah.
[3217.56 → 3218.60] They weren't that into that.
[3219.00 → 3219.36] Well,
[3219.44 → 3219.72] I don't,
[3219.82 → 3221.30] I don't think because you guys weren't good.
[3221.32 → 3223.56] I think just because they didn't really know you guys.
[3223.70 → 3224.16] And that's a
[3224.30 → 3225.90] that's a sudden change to the ask.
[3226.66 → 3226.84] Yeah.
[3226.86 → 3227.04] Hey,
[3227.04 → 3227.60] if you hire me,
[3227.64 → 3228.64] you have to hire three people.
[3228.64 → 3229.08] That's like,
[3229.32 → 3229.42] well,
[3229.44 → 3229.90] by that time,
[3229.94 → 3230.90] Brandon was with us too.
[3231.12 → 3231.40] Four.
[3231.54 → 3232.00] So four.
[3232.14 → 3232.26] Yeah.
[3232.42 → 3232.58] Yeah.
[3232.58 → 3233.06] That's a lot.
[3233.58 → 3236.74] Now I'm going to answer as though I could do anything I want.
[3236.74 → 3237.74] Um,
[3238.04 → 3238.56] I don't know.
[3238.70 → 3242.16] Being like a professional footballer looks pretty good.
[3243.98 → 3244.50] I mean,
[3244.56 → 3244.74] soccer.
[3244.96 → 3245.56] Do you mean soccer?
[3245.66 → 3245.82] Yeah.
[3245.96 → 3246.16] Yeah.
[3246.16 → 3246.30] Yeah.
[3246.30 → 3246.54] I mean,
[3246.54 → 3246.94] soccer.
[3247.12 → 3247.38] Like,
[3247.44 → 3247.76] uh,
[3247.76 → 3247.94] yeah.
[3248.00 → 3248.16] Yeah.
[3248.16 → 3250.60] Like if I could just be like Cristiano Ronaldo,
[3251.00 → 3251.56] not badminton,
[3252.06 → 3252.20] uh,
[3252.20 → 3253.08] they don't make any money.
[3253.18 → 3253.44] Okay.
[3253.86 → 3254.06] Yeah.
[3254.06 → 3254.32] Like,
[3254.36 → 3254.56] uh,
[3254.56 → 3254.82] you know,
[3254.82 → 3255.06] it's,
[3255.12 → 3257.48] it seemed like that seems pretty good or like,
[3257.54 → 3257.90] um,
[3258.40 → 3259.02] Oh man,
[3260.32 → 3264.86] can I just be the son of like someone who has a job?
[3265.12 → 3265.72] Is that,
[3266.02 → 3268.22] it appears to be a thing.
[3269.20 → 3269.60] Yeah.
[3269.82 → 3270.26] Yeah.
[3270.94 → 3271.38] Uh,
[3271.44 → 3271.72] no,
[3271.82 → 3272.10] that's,
[3272.12 → 3272.86] that doesn't really count,
[3273.02 → 3273.82] but that's all a lie.
[3273.90 → 3274.26] No,
[3274.36 → 3274.74] that's,
[3274.80 → 3277.86] that's a lie because I think you and I both know that I want to do
[3277.86 → 3278.18] something.
[3278.28 → 3278.82] I wouldn't be happy.
[3278.86 → 3282.18] I was having this conversation with Jake actually like two days ago.
[3282.20 → 3288.96] Because he sent me a picture of his trunk full of new speakers.
[3289.30 → 3293.86] When we just upgraded his speakers as part of his extreme tech upgrade.
[3294.06 → 3294.58] Okay.
[3294.70 → 3297.24] And then a week or two weeks later,
[3297.24 → 3302.60] he's sending me pictures of his Home Depot run where he got this super cool
[3302.60 → 3305.70] new acoustic material and some rock wool.
[3305.70 → 3307.76] And then the week after that,
[3307.76 → 3309.64] he's sending me pictures of like,
[3309.64 → 3311.88] he's been on a mega sound kick for a while.
[3311.88 → 3314.14] Him building panels and,
[3314.14 → 3314.48] you know,
[3314.56 → 3314.86] putting,
[3315.24 → 3315.66] uh,
[3315.74 → 3317.70] putting fabric over them and whatever.
[3318.00 → 3319.00] And I'm like,
[3319.22 → 3320.76] brother,
[3321.18 → 3325.20] you know why you drive me crazy?
[3326.08 → 3329.08] Because you are just like me.
[3329.68 → 3331.68] That is the worst thing about you.
[3331.80 → 3333.46] You are just like me.
[3333.46 → 3337.80] How long have you actually spent listening to music?
[3339.80 → 3341.10] And I have his response.
[3341.22 → 3342.38] This is fantastic.
[3343.48 → 3343.64] Uh,
[3343.88 → 3345.38] hold on.
[3345.40 → 3345.92] Where is it?
[3346.68 → 3347.22] Uh,
[3347.34 → 3347.48] but,
[3347.56 → 3347.72] but,
[3347.72 → 3347.84] but,
[3347.84 → 3347.90] but,
[3347.90 → 3348.16] but,
[3348.16 → 3351.74] but like the number of hours he has spent optimizing his,
[3351.74 → 3352.48] his setup.
[3354.72 → 3356.00] Dell's Dell switches.
[3356.00 → 3356.50] Oh man,
[3356.60 → 3358.02] I text Jake a lot.
[3358.52 → 3358.76] Uh,
[3359.04 → 3359.48] Oh,
[3360.70 → 3360.86] Oh,
[3360.86 → 3362.02] the problem is that I'm,
[3362.10 → 3362.32] uh,
[3362.32 → 3362.94] I'm on teams.
[3363.24 → 3363.64] Okay.
[3363.68 → 3364.08] Hold on.
[3365.22 → 3365.70] Uh,
[3365.94 → 3367.54] Oh,
[3367.54 → 3369.06] this is taking far too long.
[3369.12 → 3369.86] I'm so sorry.
[3369.94 → 3374.54] I thought this was going to be the kind of thing that I just had ready at a moment's notice.
[3375.22 → 3375.58] Anyway,
[3375.58 → 3375.94] whatever.
[3376.06 → 3384.90] The point is it was like four minutes because he spent all his time setting it up.
[3384.90 → 3385.42] Yeah.
[3385.56 → 3386.48] Many hours.
[3386.48 → 3387.30] And it was like,
[3387.30 → 3388.26] dang,
[3388.34 → 3389.26] this sounds awesome.
[3389.32 → 3392.02] So it's like how you would spend like weeks building the
[3392.02 → 3394.62] the perfect thing with a computer and then don't play any games.
[3395.16 → 3395.38] Yeah.
[3395.56 → 3395.82] Yeah.
[3395.94 → 3402.84] Or how I would spend hours setting up a headphone listening room with all different amps and
[3402.84 → 3403.86] Days and headphones,
[3404.02 → 3404.94] which we did here.
[3404.94 → 3407.12] And then not use it once.
[3408.18 → 3410.36] Or like how I would set up,
[3410.36 → 3410.94] um,
[3411.14 → 3417.24] a gaming lounge so that I can hang out on lounge nights only to show up a grand total of probably
[3417.24 → 3417.86] three times.
[3417.86 → 3420.30] I think I've managed to make it to lounge night and,
[3420.30 → 3420.80] and,
[3420.80 → 3421.64] and I,
[3421.72 → 3424.82] I even have made it like part of Chase's duties,
[3424.96 → 3426.04] our event coordinator,
[3426.24 → 3429.26] part of his duties to ensure that those happen every two weeks.
[3429.30 → 3429.94] So they're happening.
[3430.26 → 3431.58] I'm paying for it.
[3431.64 → 3434.40] And I almost never actually get to go.
[3434.40 → 3434.92] So,
[3434.92 → 3434.98] or,
[3435.32 → 3435.66] okay,
[3435.66 → 3436.76] since we're at it,
[3436.82 → 3440.12] how I would set up a home theatre room so that,
[3440.28 → 3440.68] I mean,
[3440.74 → 3442.04] I guess my kids use it,
[3442.14 → 3446.82] but I think I've actually only watched about four movies since we moved in,
[3447.04 → 3447.86] in the theatre room.
[3447.86 → 3450.24] because I just,
[3450.24 → 3452.02] I can't help it.
[3452.18 → 3453.54] I would rather,
[3453.54 → 3461.06] I would rather build the Lego kit than actually play with my Lego dragon when I'm done.
[3461.50 → 3463.16] It's just the way that I am.
[3463.16 → 3465.82] So if I had to,
[3465.82 → 3468.00] if I had to get into an industry,
[3468.10 → 3469.48] maybe I would get into like,
[3469.48 → 3469.98] um,
[3470.32 → 3471.52] commercial real estate development,
[3472.24 → 3473.84] something like that.
[3474.68 → 3476.38] If the clients weren't horrible,
[3476.38 → 3483.32] I think it could actually be pretty enjoyable because you're just constantly learning about what this person's work,
[3483.38 → 3484.24] what this company,
[3484.36 → 3485.88] this organization's workflow is.
[3485.90 → 3487.06] I feel like you and Yvonne both like that.
[3487.40 → 3487.80] And,
[3487.86 → 3488.22] and,
[3488.30 → 3488.50] and,
[3488.50 → 3488.86] and,
[3488.86 → 3490.92] and finding solutions and optimizing.
[3490.92 → 3491.80] Um,
[3491.80 → 3493.50] I think another thing that would be,
[3493.62 → 3498.26] that would be pretty fun for me is anything to do with anything like really hands on.
[3499.20 → 3499.64] Um,
[3500.68 → 3502.30] ah,
[3502.50 → 3503.12] no,
[3503.52 → 3503.76] nope.
[3503.84 → 3504.66] That's what I'm going with.
[3504.80 → 3505.10] Okay.
[3505.20 → 3505.68] Your answer.
[3506.48 → 3509.66] I had a ton of different paths that I was pursuing,
[3509.66 → 3514.36] like actually an insane amount of different things that I was actually working on.
[3514.68 → 3515.08] Um,
[3516.52 → 3520.04] the most direct path that I was on,
[3520.04 → 3526.18] the thing that I had like an offer for and whatnot was like software development and database management based.
[3526.52 → 3527.78] Would I have wanted to do that forever?
[3527.90 → 3528.36] Probably not,
[3528.46 → 3530.26] but it seemed like the most direct path out of school.
[3530.26 → 3532.92] And you would have just automated the vast majority of it and like,
[3532.98 → 3533.26] I don't know,
[3533.30 → 3534.04] played video games,
[3534.16 → 3535.40] but I think you would have gotten bored.
[3535.54 → 3536.26] I would have gotten bored.
[3536.48 → 3536.76] Exactly.
[3536.80 → 3536.94] Yeah.
[3536.94 → 3537.36] A hundred percent.
[3537.48 → 3537.58] Yeah.
[3538.24 → 3538.60] Um,
[3539.56 → 3540.96] yeah.
[3541.34 → 3545.24] So unless you did it at a tiny company where everything was constantly on fire.
[3545.64 → 3548.48] So what I think I actually probably would have ended up doing,
[3548.48 → 3551.50] this is still not like get to pick anything in the world is your career.
[3551.62 → 3551.90] Yeah.
[3552.16 → 3552.48] But,
[3552.48 → 3552.94] uh,
[3552.94 → 3554.04] like disaster recovery.
[3554.58 → 3554.90] Okay.
[3554.98 → 3555.12] Sure.
[3555.12 → 3556.78] I genuinely think I would really enjoy that.
[3557.14 → 3558.82] Probably like nation scale.
[3560.14 → 3560.58] Um,
[3560.78 → 3562.30] so like natural disaster recovery.
[3562.50 → 3562.86] Oh,
[3562.96 → 3563.32] okay.
[3563.42 → 3563.86] Interesting.
[3563.86 → 3568.10] So like figuring out how comes and logistics are going to work and whatever.
[3568.30 → 3568.70] Okay.
[3568.70 → 3571.32] And then like coordinating responses and doing all that kind of stuff.
[3571.46 → 3573.22] I genuinely think I would really like that.
[3573.72 → 3574.08] Um,
[3574.26 → 3575.92] if I could pick anything,
[3576.16 → 3576.58] uh,
[3576.70 → 3577.20] astronaut,
[3577.52 → 3578.92] and I actually do mean that seriously.
[3579.12 → 3582.40] I just don't think I would actually be able to like to make the cut right now.
[3582.72 → 3583.28] Oh yeah.
[3583.66 → 3583.92] Yeah.
[3583.98 → 3584.12] No,
[3584.16 → 3584.56] you have to be,
[3584.56 → 3585.82] you have to be like genius.
[3586.16 → 3586.40] Perfect.
[3586.40 → 3587.34] Like an athlete.
[3587.58 → 3587.70] Yeah.
[3587.90 → 3588.80] And whatever.
[3588.84 → 3589.14] And like,
[3589.20 → 3593.54] I have bad eyes and dyslexia and like other things where like,
[3593.62 → 3593.76] yeah.
[3593.76 → 3595.60] And you're like almost too old at this point.
[3595.64 → 3595.84] Yeah,
[3595.84 → 3596.84] probably like,
[3596.84 → 3597.70] yeah.
[3597.70 → 3598.22] Get rest.
[3598.32 → 3598.50] I mean,
[3598.52 → 3606.18] I thought about it when I was younger, and then I thought about the cuts that you have to go along and all this type of stuff and where you end up if you don't make the cuts.
[3606.98 → 3607.78] And I was like,
[3608.14 → 3608.50] yeah,
[3608.60 → 3609.56] probably not.
[3610.98 → 3613.06] I think I'm not going to go in that direction.
[3613.28 → 3613.62] Right.
[3613.78 → 3614.88] So it's one of those,
[3614.92 → 3616.14] it's one of those career paths,
[3616.28 → 3617.72] like star quarterback.
[3618.66 → 3619.02] Yeah.
[3619.02 → 3620.98] If you make it cool.
[3621.16 → 3621.50] Great.
[3621.68 → 3622.72] And if you don't,
[3622.72 → 3623.24] it's like,
[3623.44 → 3623.78] uh,
[3623.84 → 3624.48] and it's,
[3624.48 → 3627.64] it's not a hundred percent that way because you usually end up,
[3627.70 → 3630.34] with very extreme education experience and stuff.
[3630.34 → 3631.54] And the jobs that you can get,
[3631.60 → 3632.66] if you don't make it are,
[3632.78 → 3634.86] are very good.
[3634.96 → 3635.18] Sure.
[3635.18 → 3636.02] Often respectable.
[3636.50 → 3636.86] Yes.
[3636.86 → 3638.60] But not what I would necessarily want to do.
[3639.02 → 3639.60] I get it.
[3639.68 → 3640.02] So it's not,
[3640.06 → 3640.64] it's not quite the
[3640.72 → 3642.24] it's sort of as in like,
[3642.64 → 3644.44] it ends you up somewhere that you don't want to be,
[3644.50 → 3648.86] but not as much because a lot of the potential jobs are like very serious,
[3648.98 → 3650.80] big time career type things,
[3650.80 → 3654.46] but they're still not necessarily things that I would want to do.
[3654.76 → 3655.20] Hit us again,
[3655.28 → 3655.48] Dan.
[3655.70 → 3655.94] Yeah.
[3655.94 → 3657.40] Oh,
[3657.44 → 3660.62] I think it's about time to move on to some more topics unless you really do want another one.
[3660.68 → 3660.74] Yeah.
[3660.74 → 3661.62] You have to give us one more.
[3661.76 → 3661.96] Sorry.
[3662.16 → 3662.62] All right.
[3663.04 → 3663.44] All right.
[3663.56 → 3664.14] I don't make the rules.
[3664.14 → 3664.54] We're work.
[3664.66 → 3665.24] You do.
[3665.32 → 3666.36] We're working through it together.
[3666.78 → 3667.14] Okay.
[3667.16 → 3668.30] Next up is from Gary.
[3668.82 → 3669.10] Uh,
[3669.16 → 3669.50] discuss.
[3669.86 → 3671.34] This is more of a demand than a question.
[3671.42 → 3671.76] I assume.
[3672.12 → 3672.38] Uh,
[3672.38 → 3678.56] a pair of 17-year-old students used a flipper zero finding flaws in their school's RFID and network.
[3678.80 → 3680.90] Students are now facing legal trouble.
[3681.06 → 3683.98] That's what do you tell parents,
[3684.34 → 3684.88] students,
[3684.88 → 3698.94] so this is a tough one because while they might have been right,
[3698.94 → 3700.48] we're missing some information,
[3700.60 → 3701.62] find vulnerabilities.
[3701.62 → 3701.98] Yeah.
[3702.04 → 3702.18] We,
[3702.18 → 3703.38] we don't have the whole story here,
[3703.38 → 3714.62] so I'm going to have to kind of come at it a few different ways while they might have been right to find and disclose vulnerabilities to actually enact,
[3714.88 → 3715.54] them,
[3715.54 → 3715.88] to,
[3715.88 → 3716.20] to,
[3716.20 → 3721.20] to exploit them in any way could very well be illegal.
[3722.00 → 3722.32] Um,
[3722.32 → 3723.70] it's kind of like how,
[3723.88 → 3728.74] it's kind of like how it would be fine to knock on someone's door and tell them,
[3728.74 → 3729.14] hey,
[3730.00 → 3730.34] um,
[3730.38 → 3735.12] that lock on your door is super insecure, and you should replace it.
[3735.34 → 3736.24] Have a great one.
[3736.60 → 3737.18] See you later.
[3737.92 → 3738.56] That's fine.
[3738.66 → 3740.14] But if you sit there attempting to pick it,
[3740.14 → 3743.38] but if you sit there and pick it and walk into their house, and you're like,
[3743.38 → 3744.14] hey,
[3744.32 → 3744.72] um,
[3744.80 → 3745.72] well-meaning neighbour,
[3745.96 → 3746.54] yeah,
[3746.56 → 3747.28] everything's chill.
[3747.38 → 3747.72] So I'll,
[3747.72 → 3747.86] I'll,
[3747.86 → 3748.88] I'll be on my way in a sec,
[3748.92 → 3750.38] but your door is super insecure.
[3750.38 → 3752.46] I was able to pick that in like 10 seconds.
[3752.60 → 3753.00] Uh,
[3753.00 → 3753.52] see you later.
[3754.34 → 3755.46] That's still breaking and entering.
[3756.72 → 3757.08] Um,
[3757.22 → 3757.42] yeah.
[3757.42 → 3758.42] So,
[3758.42 → 3761.62] so there's some stuff about this that we don't know.
[3761.94 → 3762.26] If they,
[3762.38 → 3764.84] if they detected vulnerabilities using flipper zero,
[3764.84 → 3768.26] didn't do anything with them and then reported it to the school and the
[3768.26 → 3769.94] school is trying to go after them with legal trouble.
[3771.88 → 3776.62] I hope that the internet rains down on that school with everything they've got.
[3777.04 → 3779.10] If they like did abuse things,
[3779.10 → 3779.88] uh,
[3779.90 → 3782.78] I still think they should have a light hand with them.
[3783.00 → 3783.78] They're students.
[3784.64 → 3785.00] Um,
[3785.74 → 3787.02] we don't know how old these students are.
[3787.02 → 3787.78] That's fair.
[3788.48 → 3791.46] There are students who are like 18 and a pair of 17-year-old students.
[3791.56 → 3792.56] We actually do know how old they are.
[3792.66 → 3792.82] Yeah.
[3792.96 → 3793.18] They're,
[3793.18 → 3794.04] they're old enough.
[3795.04 → 3795.58] I mean,
[3795.64 → 3796.28] come on.
[3796.42 → 3797.80] It depends on what they do in my opinion.
[3797.92 → 3798.10] Yeah,
[3798.10 → 3798.36] sure.
[3798.46 → 3801.04] If they like to mess around and like change the text on the school sign.
[3801.16 → 3801.42] Yeah.
[3801.46 → 3802.68] That's pretty minor.
[3802.90 → 3803.16] Yeah.
[3803.24 → 3804.00] That's just pranking.
[3804.20 → 3805.26] Give them a slap on the wrist,
[3805.76 → 3806.12] whatever.
[3806.44 → 3808.84] If they tried to like to change their grades or something,
[3809.06 → 3812.34] I'm not saying this is even like possible with that system.
[3812.46 → 3814.64] I'm just saying like that level of thing,
[3814.72 → 3815.98] then that could be a problem,
[3816.12 → 3816.42] you know?
[3817.02 → 3817.46] No,
[3817.52 → 3818.06] don't say that.
[3818.14 → 3818.66] Don't say what?
[3818.74 → 3819.28] What did I say?
[3822.10 → 3822.88] I don't know.
[3823.30 → 3823.66] Whatever.
[3823.90 → 3824.24] Moving on.
[3824.88 → 3825.28] All right.
[3825.44 → 3827.60] Let's move on to our next topic here.
[3827.98 → 3829.54] Do you want to talk about the Mario movie?
[3830.88 → 3831.06] Uh,
[3831.08 → 3831.22] yeah,
[3831.30 → 3831.54] sure.
[3831.72 → 3832.84] Now you haven't seen it.
[3832.98 → 3833.10] No,
[3833.14 → 3833.30] right?
[3833.62 → 3833.78] Nope.
[3833.86 → 3834.76] Have you read reviews?
[3835.92 → 3836.36] Uh,
[3836.74 → 3837.34] or looked at,
[3837.44 → 3837.94] watched reviews?
[3838.02 → 3838.28] I don't know.
[3838.30 → 3840.46] How do we pull review these days?
[3840.74 → 3841.36] Sort of.
[3841.82 → 3842.16] Okay.
[3842.16 → 3844.18] It's doing better than I thought it was going to do.
[3844.26 → 3845.28] What are your expectations?
[3845.82 → 3846.10] Are you,
[3846.16 → 3846.90] are you going to watch it?
[3847.60 → 3849.24] Cause you like never go to the movies.
[3849.38 → 3850.50] I very rarely go to the movies.
[3850.60 → 3851.60] When's the last time you went to a movie?
[3852.32 → 3853.46] I literally don't know.
[3854.08 → 3856.08] Was it when we went to see the second Kinsman?
[3860.70 → 3861.42] I think so.
[3861.48 → 3861.68] Yeah.
[3862.02 → 3862.70] Cause that was like,
[3863.30 → 3864.90] there's the third one is like out,
[3865.14 → 3866.12] you know,
[3866.18 → 3867.78] did we go see that one?
[3868.12 → 3868.46] No,
[3868.52 → 3869.72] we watched that one at my place.
[3870.22 → 3870.70] Oh yeah.
[3870.74 → 3871.46] Very disappointing.
[3871.64 → 3872.28] Because I remember it.
[3872.46 → 3872.74] Yeah.
[3872.74 → 3874.08] It was pretty bad.
[3874.48 → 3874.62] Yeah.
[3875.46 → 3875.78] Um,
[3876.90 → 3877.56] are you going to go?
[3877.86 → 3878.34] I don't know.
[3878.40 → 3880.16] I am planning on going to the movies soon.
[3880.74 → 3882.68] I want to go see John Wick 4 with Brandon.
[3882.76 → 3883.10] Okay.
[3883.10 → 3883.50] All right.
[3883.58 → 3883.82] Cool,
[3883.82 → 3884.04] cool,
[3884.04 → 3884.08] cool,
[3884.08 → 3884.26] cool.
[3884.36 → 3886.64] I like going to see cinematic movies with Brandon.
[3886.78 → 3888.34] Cause then he gets to geek out about them afterwards.
[3888.64 → 3889.00] And it's like,
[3889.08 → 3889.38] that's,
[3889.40 → 3889.82] that's fun.
[3890.26 → 3890.70] Um,
[3890.86 → 3891.66] but I don't know.
[3891.74 → 3894.22] I would probably wait for it to come to some service.
[3895.94 → 3899.30] But I can definitely watch because I definitely subscribe to it.
[3900.32 → 3903.06] It's surprisingly fine.
[3903.86 → 3904.22] Okay.
[3905.26 → 3909.16] My expectations based on the critical reception were pretty low.
[3909.34 → 3909.62] Oh yeah.
[3909.74 → 3909.90] I,
[3909.92 → 3911.50] I assumed it was garbage.
[3911.94 → 3912.38] And then,
[3912.38 → 3914.82] apparently people seem to like it a decent amount.
[3915.04 → 3915.18] Yeah.
[3915.22 → 3916.86] Right now on rotten tomatoes.
[3917.18 → 3918.54] Let me jump to my screen.
[3918.92 → 3919.86] Not that one.
[3919.92 → 3920.58] Oh boy.
[3920.72 → 3921.18] This one,
[3921.36 → 3922.12] um,
[3922.26 → 3922.58] the
[3922.66 → 3923.58] the tomato meter.
[3923.58 → 3924.14] So the
[3924.14 → 3925.90] the reviewers gave it a 58,
[3926.02 → 3927.14] but audience 96.
[3927.84 → 3928.16] Yeah.
[3928.96 → 3929.88] People like it.
[3930.22 → 3932.22] Those are both completely wrong.
[3934.18 → 3934.78] It is,
[3934.88 → 3938.96] it is not a 96% piece of storytelling.
[3939.96 → 3940.20] Um,
[3940.26 → 3940.40] well,
[3940.48 → 3940.70] okay.
[3940.78 → 3941.06] No,
[3941.06 → 3942.44] it's a visual fiesta.
[3942.44 → 3942.88] That's not,
[3942.88 → 3944.56] that's not how rotten tomatoes works.
[3945.06 → 3946.96] Cause rotten tomatoes is yes or no.
[3947.00 → 3947.86] And if you vote yes,
[3947.92 → 3948.48] it's like,
[3948.70 → 3949.36] it goes up.
[3949.44 → 3949.70] Okay.
[3949.86 → 3950.08] Yeah.
[3950.08 → 3950.32] But,
[3950.50 → 3951.58] but in general,
[3951.88 → 3952.40] what we've,
[3952.52 → 3952.66] what,
[3953.04 → 3957.82] what would typically be a 96% would have to have everything.
[3957.82 → 3958.04] Yeah.
[3958.04 → 3960.92] It would have to be great fun for the whole family,
[3961.22 → 3961.52] you know,
[3961.90 → 3964.22] all the multiple layers of whatever,
[3964.38 → 3964.52] you know,
[3964.56 → 3966.46] something like an up is,
[3966.46 → 3969.26] is a masterful-animated film.
[3969.36 → 3969.62] Definitely.
[3969.94 → 3970.38] Um,
[3970.68 → 3971.96] it's not up.
[3972.50 → 3973.06] Right.
[3973.36 → 3975.22] It's what is ups ratings?
[3976.04 → 3976.26] Oh,
[3976.26 → 3977.54] it's probably close to a hundred percent.
[3978.36 → 3978.62] I mean,
[3978.62 → 3979.52] I kind of hope so.
[3980.74 → 3981.22] 98.
[3981.80 → 3982.06] Yeah.
[3982.48 → 3983.86] It's not 2%.
[3983.86 → 3984.20] Yeah.
[3984.28 → 3985.66] It's not 2% worse than up.
[3985.70 → 3986.00] It's not,
[3986.08 → 3986.62] it's not close.
[3986.62 → 3988.68] The audience score for up is 90.
[3989.16 → 3989.30] Yeah.
[3989.30 → 3990.68] The tomato meter is 98.
[3990.96 → 3991.62] Up is,
[3991.68 → 3993.04] people have bad taste.
[3993.62 → 3993.92] Yeah.
[3994.12 → 3994.74] So anyway,
[3995.16 → 3995.56] um,
[3995.60 → 3996.98] the Super Mario brothers movie though,
[3997.02 → 3997.62] what it is,
[3998.00 → 3998.84] is good,
[3999.02 → 3999.30] clean,
[3999.42 → 3999.74] fun.
[3999.84 → 4001.28] It's Nintendo.
[4002.28 → 4002.92] I mean,
[4002.92 → 4004.18] that's probably good.
[4004.30 → 4004.76] It's good,
[4004.86 → 4005.04] clean,
[4005.14 → 4005.44] fun.
[4005.60 → 4006.04] It's,
[4006.04 → 4006.86] um,
[4006.90 → 4007.10] you know,
[4007.14 → 4010.58] everything that I was worried would be kind of garbage about it.
[4010.82 → 4011.18] Um,
[4011.18 → 4011.80] like if they,
[4011.88 → 4013.30] if they overdid the
[4013.30 → 4014.54] the references and,
[4014.62 → 4014.88] and they,
[4014.98 → 4015.14] they,
[4015.22 → 4015.64] they did.
[4015.74 → 4015.86] It's,
[4015.94 → 4016.28] of course,
[4016.28 → 4016.92] there are a lot of references.
[4016.92 → 4018.56] It's from one reference to one reference to,
[4018.62 → 4019.50] to another reference.
[4019.50 → 4019.94] But you know,
[4019.94 → 4020.94] Nintendo has,
[4021.34 → 4021.66] what,
[4021.72 → 4022.06] what are we,
[4022.12 → 4023.10] what are we coming up on?
[4023.10 → 4023.36] Like,
[4023.38 → 4023.54] you know,
[4023.60 → 4024.66] 40 years of,
[4024.66 → 4028.46] of like modern era video gaming content to pull from.
[4028.46 → 4029.06] Not their old playing cards.
[4029.36 → 4029.58] Whether,
[4029.70 → 4030.30] whether it's,
[4030.38 → 4033.70] whether it's music or characters or environments or,
[4033.70 → 4036.34] or game or mechanics or whatever else it is.
[4036.34 → 4036.56] Sorry,
[4036.62 → 4036.92] plumbers.
[4037.32 → 4037.50] Um,
[4037.82 → 4039.04] um,
[4039.34 → 4039.82] Nintendo,
[4039.98 → 4045.02] Nintendo has so much to draw on that they can do that without it feeling stale.
[4045.02 → 4045.74] And I actually,
[4046.30 → 4046.60] I,
[4046.66 → 4047.50] I enjoyed it.
[4048.16 → 4050.66] It's not the kind of thing that I would watch again.
[4050.92 → 4051.14] I,
[4051.14 → 4051.48] I don't,
[4051.56 → 4052.28] I don't need to,
[4052.42 → 4053.18] I don't need that.
[4053.62 → 4054.02] Um,
[4054.02 → 4054.18] I,
[4054.22 → 4054.78] I definitely,
[4055.00 → 4055.18] you know,
[4055.26 → 4057.24] I prefer despicable me if I'm gonna,
[4057.42 → 4057.64] you know,
[4057.64 → 4059.12] pick an illumination film that I,
[4059.22 → 4059.82] that I like better.
[4059.96 → 4060.24] Okay.
[4060.24 → 4063.04] But it was fine.
[4063.28 → 4063.78] Good enough.
[4064.06 → 4064.30] Yeah.
[4064.36 → 4065.02] It was totally good enough.
[4065.04 → 4065.82] The kids loved it.
[4065.92 → 4068.66] Do you feel like the voice acting detracted from it?
[4069.22 → 4069.96] You know what?
[4070.60 → 4071.30] Controversial take.
[4071.38 → 4071.98] Here we go.
[4072.06 → 4073.30] I thought Chris Pratt was fine.
[4073.30 → 4075.12] I thought Anya Taylor-Joy was terrible.
[4076.32 → 4080.46] She took me out of the movie basically every time Princess Peach opened her mouth.
[4081.02 → 4082.84] And it didn't take you out for Chris Pratt.
[4083.26 → 4083.44] No,
[4083.48 → 4083.86] it's fine.
[4084.28 → 4084.72] Interesting.
[4085.38 → 4085.66] Yeah.
[4085.66 → 4093.48] The thing that's crazy to me is that the voice actor for Mario is like alive and around.
[4093.48 → 4093.90] He's in the movie.
[4094.26 → 4094.62] Oh,
[4094.76 → 4095.42] what the heck?
[4095.54 → 4095.68] Yeah.
[4095.96 → 4096.18] Yeah,
[4096.18 → 4096.54] it's fine.
[4096.88 → 4097.20] It's like,
[4097.20 → 4097.44] it's like,
[4097.50 → 4098.20] like I said,
[4098.30 → 4101.16] everything that I thought was terrible, and I'm not really spoiling anything.
[4101.30 → 4101.52] It's,
[4101.62 → 4103.10] it's revealed in like the first couple minutes.
[4103.52 → 4103.88] Uh,
[4103.88 → 4108.46] everything that I thought was going to be bad was fine.
[4108.58 → 4110.70] I want to ask like how they explain that away and stuff,
[4110.78 → 4111.94] but it's going to be too spoiler.
[4112.04 → 4112.22] No,
[4112.26 → 4112.40] no,
[4112.42 → 4112.60] it's,
[4112.64 → 4112.96] it's just,
[4113.04 → 4113.52] it's fine.
[4113.78 → 4114.10] Okay.
[4114.44 → 4115.22] And it's fine.
[4115.22 → 4115.78] Yeah.
[4116.12 → 4116.56] Um,
[4116.70 → 4118.66] the second one is going to be dog.
[4120.94 → 4121.98] I'm calling it.
[4122.10 → 4123.80] You feel like they spent all their like,
[4124.08 → 4124.24] yeah,
[4124.56 → 4124.82] yeah.
[4125.06 → 4125.26] Yep.
[4125.28 → 4126.62] All the good references are spent.
[4126.80 → 4127.04] Well,
[4127.32 → 4131.66] any character development that they can do for Mario is,
[4132.80 → 4133.42] there's,
[4133.54 → 4135.18] there's plenty more to explore.
[4135.38 → 4139.94] They have set up a cinematic universe worth of things to explore.
[4140.06 → 4140.16] Yeah.
[4140.22 → 4140.38] Yeah.
[4141.58 → 4144.86] Which means someone is on a time,
[4144.86 → 4154.52] is on a time crunch creating the next cookie cutter instalment of this that is meant to come out on X schedule,
[4154.80 → 4156.20] come hell or high water.
[4156.20 → 4157.76] And don't forget about the
[4157.76 → 4160.22] the TV show tie-ins and all the
[4160.22 → 4162.78] the video game tie-ins that you're going to have to,
[4163.06 → 4169.78] you're going to have to play in order to know what's happening when Peach gets captured by Bowser and goes there, and she gets rescued.
[4169.78 → 4171.78] And there's going to be a little wink to the audience.
[4171.78 → 4179.96] And there's going to be a little wink to the audience in Super Mario Brothers Movie 4 and Toad's standalone adventure movie when he has Toad's Adventure 2 or whatever.
[4179.96 → 4183.50] It's going to be awful.
[4185.02 → 4186.80] I'm calling it now.
[4187.02 → 4193.78] It's going to get super self-referential to itself rather than to the rich video game history.
[4193.78 → 4200.64] Or I could be totally wrong and Nintendo could go an utterly different direction with it.
[4201.98 → 4202.36] Spoilers.
[4202.44 → 4202.54] No,
[4202.60 → 4202.72] there's,
[4202.76 → 4203.44] there are no spoilers.
[4203.56 → 4203.90] I'm just,
[4204.00 → 4204.38] I'm just,
[4204.64 → 4205.82] I'm just talking about it.
[4206.44 → 4208.00] Spoilers for the movie that isn't out yet.
[4208.46 → 4208.64] Yeah,
[4208.78 → 4209.16] exactly,
[4209.16 → 4210.14] exactly guys.
[4210.46 → 4211.06] But yeah,
[4211.12 → 4211.30] yeah.
[4211.30 → 4211.90] Smash Bros.
[4212.30 → 4216.98] Multiverse is 100% going to be a thing, and it's going to be atrocious.
[4217.86 → 4221.68] Because the other thing too is they went with all their most recognizable characters right out of the gate.
[4221.78 → 4222.24] So what?
[4222.34 → 4226.26] It's going to be like Icarus and Game & Watch.
[4226.86 → 4226.88] Like,
[4227.02 → 4228.12] right?
[4228.20 → 4230.30] Do you think they could do the adventures of someone else?
[4230.88 → 4231.30] I mean,
[4231.38 → 4231.84] they could,
[4232.00 → 4232.42] they could.
[4232.50 → 4233.34] Does it wouldn't perform as well?
[4235.06 → 4237.18] I think if they wanted it to be good,
[4237.84 → 4241.20] they would probably go separate universes.
[4242.62 → 4244.14] Do you think they could do stuff like,
[4244.20 → 4246.68] like someone in float plane chat mentioned Luigi going,
[4246.68 → 4247.50] Ghostbusters?
[4247.94 → 4249.54] Do you think they could do like a
[4249.54 → 4254.04] like a murder mystery style thing with like the Luigi haunted house stuff?
[4254.88 → 4259.16] There's so much room for them to do something creative and amazing.
[4259.48 → 4259.76] You know,
[4259.86 → 4260.16] I'd,
[4260.16 → 4261.70] I'd love to see a Zelda movie.
[4262.08 → 4262.50] Oh,
[4262.84 → 4266.58] I'd love to see it done really well.
[4266.76 → 4267.96] It has to be done really well.
[4268.06 → 4268.88] Totally different.
[4269.06 → 4269.18] Like,
[4269.24 → 4271.26] I'm still burnt off the Warcraft movie.
[4271.38 → 4271.58] Like,
[4271.58 → 4273.52] I still like to have a huge lack of trust.
[4273.66 → 4273.80] Like,
[4273.90 → 4274.86] I almost want like,
[4274.86 → 4277.18] like cast away kind of vibes where,
[4277.18 → 4280.06] where it really focuses on,
[4280.06 → 4283.36] on Link and his lonely wandering,
[4283.68 → 4284.62] uh,
[4284.64 → 4284.80] or,
[4284.80 → 4285.98] or something,
[4286.08 → 4287.44] do something totally different.
[4287.68 → 4293.02] The problem is that this is now the most successful animated film of all time.
[4293.02 → 4293.72] Yeah.
[4293.72 → 4295.34] In terms of like its first week take.
[4295.50 → 4295.72] Yeah.
[4296.24 → 4298.64] And you know how bean counters work,
[4298.76 → 4300.08] whether they're Nintendo bean counters.
[4300.08 → 4300.98] Give us number two.
[4301.06 → 4302.32] Or Disney bean counters.
[4302.80 → 4303.20] That,
[4303.36 → 4303.66] that,
[4303.82 → 4304.78] more of that.
[4305.88 → 4306.10] Yeah.
[4307.76 → 4308.20] Yeah.
[4308.40 → 4308.64] Yeah.
[4308.64 → 4309.12] It's disappointing.
[4309.48 → 4309.62] Yeah.
[4309.68 → 4310.88] I like Breath of the Wild,
[4311.34 → 4312.40] uh,
[4312.48 → 4316.22] like Legend of Zelda spinoff movie could actually be super sick.
[4316.22 → 4317.20] like a
[4317.20 → 4319.42] like a hardcore survival film,
[4319.42 → 4322.46] but it's like Link trying to.
[4323.30 → 4323.46] Ooh,
[4323.48 → 4324.62] live action would be cool.
[4326.12 → 4326.52] Yeah.
[4326.60 → 4327.18] It could be good.
[4329.50 → 4330.74] You want it to be animated?
[4331.54 → 4332.48] My thing is,
[4332.54 → 4333.18] my thing is,
[4333.18 → 4334.06] I don't think it should be cutesy.
[4334.06 → 4335.58] They took the Warcraft movie.
[4336.04 → 4336.44] Yeah.
[4336.50 → 4337.26] Which has like,
[4337.40 → 4338.66] like people would watch.
[4338.74 → 4339.78] This was actually a thing.
[4339.94 → 4343.20] People uploaded just all the cinematic for Warcraft three,
[4343.20 → 4348.76] which don't even go into each other properly and just uploaded all of them in one video file onto YouTube.
[4348.90 → 4349.94] Still a better movie than Twilight.
[4350.06 → 4352.80] And people would just watch the whole thing all the way through.
[4352.92 → 4355.04] It had tons of views back in the day.
[4355.20 → 4355.38] Yeah.
[4355.42 → 4359.16] Because the cinematic that Blizzard made for so long,
[4359.24 → 4361.70] even now when they make full-fledged ones,
[4361.80 → 4362.06] because they,
[4362.20 → 4363.28] not the in-game ones,
[4363.36 → 4368.14] but when they make full-fledged ones are like just absolutely legendary cinematic.
[4368.76 → 4369.36] And then they're like,
[4369.50 → 4370.26] Warcraft movie,
[4370.50 → 4371.30] live action.
[4371.30 → 4372.06] Like what,
[4372.16 → 4373.30] what are you doing?
[4373.58 → 4374.08] And so I,
[4374.28 → 4375.06] oh man.
[4375.34 → 4375.90] So I,
[4375.90 → 4376.16] I,
[4376.16 → 4376.42] I,
[4376.42 → 4378.16] I questioned that a little bit.
[4378.24 → 4378.48] Sure.
[4378.54 → 4382.92] I actually think it would be like more legit.
[4383.16 → 4383.38] I,
[4383.52 → 4385.52] I hazard saying this.
[4385.60 → 4388.66] I think it would be more legit to do that with Legend of Zelda than it is with,
[4388.66 → 4389.60] uh,
[4390.00 → 4392.44] Warcraft or really any Blizzard title to be completely honest.
[4392.76 → 4394.16] But I still just,
[4394.16 → 4395.46] I hazard that.
[4395.52 → 4396.64] There's all these like Disney,
[4396.74 → 4396.84] like,
[4396.88 → 4396.96] Oh,
[4396.98 → 4398.48] we're going to live action Lion King.
[4398.62 → 4399.40] That's stupid.
[4399.54 → 4400.14] Don't do that.
[4400.14 → 4400.38] Well,
[4400.44 → 4400.58] yeah,
[4400.58 → 4401.70] it's not even live action.
[4401.80 → 4403.24] That's just an animated movie.
[4403.52 → 4403.80] Dumb.
[4403.90 → 4407.08] Just like realistically.
[4407.18 → 4407.30] Well,
[4407.30 → 4408.66] let's take all the emotion out of it.
[4408.74 → 4408.98] Cool.
[4409.36 → 4409.64] Uh,
[4409.64 → 4410.18] so I,
[4410.30 → 4411.64] I'm speaking out of ignorance.
[4411.74 → 4413.16] I haven't watched it because I don't care.
[4413.64 → 4413.80] Yeah.
[4413.84 → 4413.96] Yeah.
[4413.96 → 4414.12] Yeah.
[4414.12 → 4414.14] Yeah.
[4414.14 → 4414.76] I just,
[4415.04 → 4415.46] uh,
[4416.06 → 4416.94] I've read the comments.
[4417.08 → 4417.48] I'm just,
[4417.66 → 4421.20] I'm just like concerned.
[4421.36 → 4421.82] That's all.
[4422.82 → 4424.22] Shia LaBeouf has link.
[4424.22 → 4424.70] Okay.
[4424.94 → 4426.12] You guys are Memling now.
[4427.56 → 4428.58] That's not funny.
[4429.74 → 4430.28] It's pretty funny.
[4430.28 → 4431.70] It's like super immersive about it.
[4432.54 → 4433.02] There's like,
[4433.24 → 4438.40] Shia LaBeouf gets arrested for like smashing pots at like Home Depot or something.
[4443.94 → 4444.74] Oh my goodness.
[4444.74 → 4444.94] I mean,
[4444.98 → 4445.82] it's not Ezra Miller.
[4446.14 → 4447.92] So I don't know who that is.
[4447.92 → 4448.10] Oh,
[4448.14 → 4448.60] that's the
[4448.70 → 4452.06] that's the actor that is just plays the flash.
[4452.06 → 4452.42] And as,
[4452.46 → 4453.52] as far as we can tell,
[4453.54 → 4455.00] just a complete weirdo.
[4455.22 → 4455.46] Oh,
[4455.56 → 4455.84] okay.
[4455.96 → 4456.18] Yeah.
[4456.26 → 4456.70] I don't know.
[4457.02 → 4457.22] Man.
[4457.22 → 4458.80] Speaking of method actors though,
[4458.90 → 4459.08] I,
[4459.14 → 4460.18] I would love,
[4460.30 → 4460.86] oh man,
[4460.86 → 4462.00] this is embarrassing.
[4462.30 → 4462.54] Uh,
[4462.54 → 4463.22] Viggo Mortensen.
[4463.40 → 4466.32] I'd love him as like Ganondorf or something.
[4466.44 → 4468.70] Just like play a villain for a change.
[4468.82 → 4469.28] That'd be cool.
[4469.40 → 4469.52] Yeah.
[4469.66 → 4470.40] That's Aragorn.
[4470.58 → 4470.84] I know.
[4471.00 → 4471.54] I knew that one.
[4471.56 → 4472.24] He doesn't know actors.
[4472.42 → 4472.54] Yeah,
[4472.54 → 4474.62] but I knew that one because I'm like a Lord of the Rings nerd.
[4475.04 → 4475.24] Yeah.
[4475.38 → 4475.78] Um,
[4476.12 → 4476.34] yeah.
[4476.42 → 4476.74] All right.
[4476.98 → 4482.82] Why don't we jump into Microsoft could be working on a windows handheld mode for Steam Deck
[4482.82 → 4483.22] alike.
[4483.44 → 4486.94] This is super exciting.
[4487.36 → 4487.60] Uh,
[4487.60 → 4492.30] not because I want the Steam Deck to fail or because I want Steam OS to see any less development.
[4492.30 → 4497.10] Not because I think that windows is an alternative to Steam OS or that I,
[4497.26 → 4501.36] that I want it to become this easier path that blah,
[4501.38 → 4501.50] blah,
[4501.54 → 4501.64] blah,
[4501.72 → 4502.84] none of those things,
[4502.84 → 4505.34] but because competition is good.
[4505.90 → 4511.10] Valve's competition in the space lit a fire under Microsoft, and we shouldn't let Valve
[4511.10 → 4512.48] run unopposed either.
[4512.98 → 4513.18] I mean,
[4513.22 → 4519.00] look how little innovation there was in Steam until EA and Ubisoft basically said,
[4519.08 → 4519.16] look,
[4519.20 → 4521.20] we're going to take our ball, and we're going to go home.
[4521.90 → 4522.38] Well,
[4522.60 → 4523.34] Valve innovated.
[4523.70 → 4524.68] Would they have done it anyway?
[4524.84 → 4525.18] I don't know.
[4525.22 → 4525.48] Maybe,
[4525.48 → 4527.58] maybe not though.
[4528.34 → 4529.16] So this is exciting.
[4529.70 → 4530.98] Prolific Microsoft leaker,
[4531.10 → 4536.30] walking cat shared two videos on Twitter that were taken from a pitch for an internal Microsoft
[4536.30 → 4537.28] hackathon project,
[4537.36 → 4540.48] showcasing a windows handheld mode.
[4540.48 → 4545.40] The pitch acknowledges that the handheld PC market is growing thanks to a device called the Steam Deck.
[4545.46 → 4546.30] This is a direct quote.
[4546.82 → 4550.86] And shows prototype features that would make Windows easier to use on such devices,
[4550.86 → 4554.94] such as optimizing the onboarding experience, which right now is very kludge.
[4555.64 → 4556.60] Cross-platform,
[4556.72 → 4558.76] a cross-platform game launcher built right into Windows.
[4559.56 → 4562.20] Are we going back to the games' folder from Vista?
[4563.02 → 4564.92] Because I'm actually down.
[4565.06 → 4565.52] I liked it.
[4565.56 → 4566.68] It was kind of awesome.
[4566.80 → 4567.18] It was good.
[4567.24 → 4569.54] I complained very recently on a WAN show about how it's,
[4569.54 → 4573.48] it's kind of annoying right now about how everything is trying to be your games' launcher.
[4573.86 → 4574.18] And like,
[4574.20 → 4576.20] I would actually just prefer one of them.
[4576.40 → 4578.26] And if Microsoft had stuck with it,
[4578.30 → 4583.18] like one of the things that it did was it pushed game developers to move their save games to one place.
[4583.30 → 4586.82] So instead of having it sometimes being an app data roaming,
[4586.82 → 4590.62] and sometimes being in program files in the game folder,
[4591.00 → 4592.80] and sometimes being in my games,
[4592.92 → 4595.58] and sometimes just being in my documents.
[4595.80 → 4595.86] Like,
[4595.98 → 4596.14] man,
[4596.30 → 4599.88] game developers have never been able to decide where your saves go.
[4600.64 → 4602.04] So Microsoft,
[4602.28 → 4606.66] one of the good things they did with Vista and with the games' folder was they consolidated it.
[4606.66 → 4607.84] It all went in one place.
[4607.90 → 4610.02] So when I had to reformat or whatever else,
[4610.14 → 4612.28] because cloud saves weren't as much of a thing,
[4612.50 → 4613.82] it was one folder that I dragged,
[4614.06 → 4615.34] and it was good to,
[4615.34 → 4616.44] and it was good to go.
[4616.82 → 4617.06] Right?
[4618.26 → 4619.38] Now you got to deal with like,
[4619.70 → 4620.86] is it in app data,
[4621.02 → 4622.64] or is it saved somewhere else,
[4622.74 → 4623.22] or what the heck's going on?
[4623.22 → 4624.20] Is it cloud saved?
[4624.32 → 4624.60] Oh man,
[4624.68 → 4627.12] cloud saves are both a blessing and a curse.
[4627.26 → 4627.40] Yeah.
[4627.52 → 4632.54] I set my kids up to play It Takes Two in the car at one point,
[4632.54 → 4633.34] and they were like,
[4633.38 → 4633.48] hey,
[4633.52 → 4634.34] what happened to our game?
[4634.38 → 4634.68] I was like,
[4634.72 → 4635.04] I don't know.
[4635.10 → 4635.42] Oh yeah,
[4635.42 → 4638.26] it turns out It Takes Two just doesn't cloud save on Steam.
[4638.54 → 4638.78] It's like,
[4638.84 → 4639.68] just not supported.
[4640.06 → 4640.84] And then I saw this,
[4640.84 → 4643.76] I saw this really awful video on,
[4643.84 → 4645.14] I don't know if it was TikTok or something.
[4645.14 → 4645.36] Anyway,
[4645.44 → 4650.84] someone was talking about how their Animal Crossing save,
[4650.92 → 4652.96] they had like 500 hours in Animal Crossing,
[4653.30 → 4655.96] and their Switch got corrupted during an update,
[4656.32 → 4657.86] and it's gone.
[4657.92 → 4663.70] Even though they do pay Nintendo for their stupid hostage-taking cloud save feature,
[4664.10 → 4664.98] Nintendo was just like,
[4665.06 → 4665.50] oh yeah,
[4665.58 → 4668.62] you have to manually enable Animal Crossing saves because they're big.
[4668.62 → 4671.46] this is a paid service,
[4671.62 → 4672.02] Nintendo.
[4673.34 → 4674.52] It's paid.
[4675.90 → 4677.24] It's actually so brutal.
[4677.42 → 4680.54] I had seen like people were upset about Animal Crossing saves,
[4680.60 → 4681.48] but I didn't know why.
[4681.84 → 4683.10] That's so brutal.
[4684.84 → 4685.90] This is something we've talked about.
[4685.90 → 4689.08] It's actually like almost unbelievable levels of brutal.
[4689.16 → 4690.28] Of just hating your customers.
[4690.62 → 4690.64] Yeah,
[4690.70 → 4691.58] like what the
[4692.02 → 4692.78] oh man.
[4693.62 → 4696.12] You mentioned when talking about the Mario movie,
[4696.32 → 4696.70] you're like,
[4696.76 → 4696.92] yep,
[4697.00 → 4697.44] it's good,
[4697.54 → 4698.72] clean fun like Nintendo.
[4699.16 → 4704.12] It sucks that Nintendo has to come with this incredibly ugly downside all the time.
[4704.26 → 4704.42] Yep.
[4704.50 → 4704.72] It's like,
[4704.78 → 4704.90] well,
[4704.96 → 4708.02] it wouldn't be that hard to just be like,
[4709.34 → 4710.68] a company that's just solid.
[4710.68 → 4711.58] To be a Super Mario bro.
[4711.58 → 4712.70] Are the games expensive?
[4712.88 → 4714.06] Do they never go on discount?
[4714.26 → 4714.48] Yeah,
[4714.62 → 4714.90] sure.
[4715.38 → 4715.76] But like,
[4715.84 → 4716.74] they're always good.
[4716.74 → 4722.46] You can back up your save to an SD card for no charge because the SD card slot is right there on the console.
[4722.58 → 4724.12] And why wouldn't we let you do that?
[4724.52 → 4725.32] That kind of stuff,
[4725.38 → 4725.58] right?
[4725.70 → 4725.96] Like,
[4726.00 → 4728.20] it seems like it would make sense for the brand,
[4728.34 → 4728.88] but they just,
[4729.00 → 4731.04] they just can't.
[4731.16 → 4732.62] They just have to be buttholes.
[4732.92 → 4733.52] And it's like,
[4733.92 → 4734.30] man,
[4734.96 → 4735.36] why?
[4735.84 → 4736.34] I don't know.
[4736.58 → 4738.44] I do have to bring back,
[4738.50 → 4739.18] I don't know if you mentioned this.
[4739.26 → 4739.34] Sorry,
[4739.38 → 4739.62] I've been,
[4739.66 → 4740.44] I've been working on something.
[4741.16 → 4742.00] But the
[4742.24 → 4743.90] this was a hackathon project.
[4744.42 → 4744.82] Right.
[4744.82 → 4745.74] So like,
[4746.22 → 4748.06] I wouldn't take this as a like,
[4748.36 → 4749.62] they're working on it.
[4749.80 → 4751.10] But there are other cool ideas.
[4751.26 → 4751.60] But,
[4751.74 → 4752.90] like driver handling,
[4753.44 → 4754.38] touch keyboard,
[4754.68 → 4759.02] controller navigation of keyboard and common Windows elements like Task View,
[4759.52 → 4761.46] controller support outside of Steam,
[4761.60 → 4762.84] and more.
[4764.46 → 4765.18] Like Luke says,
[4765.32 → 4766.06] this is no guarantee,
[4766.26 → 4769.98] but the Microsoft employees who made the presentation seem passionate about it,
[4770.02 → 4774.26] saying that Windows and Xbox app users deserve this and need this.
[4774.26 → 4775.06] They're so right.
[4775.20 → 4778.32] How have Windows and Xbox not merged more?
[4778.74 → 4778.94] Yeah.
[4779.04 → 4781.22] They're even doing a lot of the things right.
[4783.18 → 4784.96] But not 100% of the way.
[4785.30 → 4789.30] And these hackathons are often positioned to be able to find projects like this.
[4789.38 → 4792.60] So it is very possible that this does get done.
[4792.96 → 4794.24] I just don't want people being like,
[4794.30 → 4794.38] oh,
[4794.42 → 4794.94] this is coming?
[4795.06 → 4795.28] Cool.
[4795.56 → 4797.38] Because it's not necessarily coming.
[4797.38 → 4801.40] There's no word on whether they've started any kind of development on the project.
[4801.52 → 4802.90] But as PC World points out,
[4803.08 → 4805.04] they'd be kind of dumb not to.
[4805.24 → 4807.34] With the proliferation of these devices,
[4807.60 → 4812.10] and with the gap that Valve's inertia seems to have left in the market,
[4812.22 → 4814.86] the DOG Ally is outstanding.
[4815.26 → 4815.42] Yeah.
[4815.42 → 4819.94] The amount of time that I've spent with it now is much more than the last time I talked about it.
[4820.30 → 4821.30] And like,
[4821.36 → 4821.94] I was just,
[4822.32 → 4823.54] It's replaced the Steam Deck for you?
[4823.60 → 4825.18] Yvonne and I were having one of our,
[4825.24 → 4826.58] one of our home meetings,
[4827.12 → 4828.86] because she can never talk to me at work,
[4828.92 → 4829.92] because no one will let her.
[4830.72 → 4831.00] So she,
[4831.10 → 4832.66] It's very hard to get a meeting with you.
[4832.76 → 4832.96] Yeah.
[4833.12 → 4833.56] So she,
[4833.80 → 4834.88] It's actually like a battle.
[4835.78 → 4836.52] Every time.
[4836.62 → 4836.98] So anyway,
[4836.98 → 4840.02] she had a bunch of stuff in her inbox that was tagged,
[4840.20 → 4841.20] Discussed with Linus.
[4841.66 → 4844.68] And I was just chilling on the floor in the computer room,
[4844.78 → 4847.32] playing Vampire Survivors on the DOG Ally,
[4847.84 → 4852.16] with it being completely dead silent in the power saving mode,
[4852.24 → 4854.22] because it's not a super demanding game.
[4854.80 → 4856.08] And I mean,
[4856.08 → 4858.94] it's obviously a pretty like brain turned off kind of game,
[4859.04 → 4860.74] just like essentially having a meeting.
[4860.74 → 4860.86] Absolutely.
[4861.16 → 4861.26] Yeah.
[4861.64 → 4863.42] It runs so smooth,
[4863.52 → 4864.54] 120 Hertz.
[4864.92 → 4866.82] It's way more powerful than the Steam Deck.
[4866.82 → 4867.34] Way,
[4867.72 → 4868.66] way more powerful.
[4870.06 → 4871.88] And it's not going to be the only one.
[4872.12 → 4879.72] Is it cool to have a computing device where you had a very significant performance jump that was noticeable?
[4880.58 → 4881.06] Yeah.
[4881.44 → 4883.84] Because I feel like that hasn't super been a thing for a while,
[4884.02 → 4884.52] but I,
[4884.52 → 4884.78] I,
[4884.78 → 4886.86] I recognized only just now,
[4886.86 → 4889.22] but I've had this feeling the whole time you've been talking about it,
[4889.22 → 4896.14] that there's like a different level of excitement because this like super perceivable jump in performance is not so much of a thing.
[4896.14 → 4896.62] No,
[4896.68 → 4896.94] lately.
[4897.18 → 4897.28] No,
[4897.34 → 4897.62] it's not.
[4897.70 → 4898.72] It's twice as fast.
[4898.96 → 4899.16] Yeah.
[4899.22 → 4899.78] And it's like,
[4899.86 → 4900.44] that's crazy.
[4900.58 → 4901.66] And it is still a thing.
[4901.92 → 4902.90] It is still a thing.
[4903.54 → 4903.78] Um,
[4903.88 → 4904.32] and like if,
[4904.36 → 4904.52] if,
[4904.66 → 4907.36] if an SSD was twice as fast right now,
[4907.50 → 4909.00] it wouldn't matter.
[4909.20 → 4910.42] Most users are not going to notice.
[4910.42 → 4910.86] But,
[4910.90 → 4911.26] okay.
[4911.36 → 4912.48] So that's exactly the thing.
[4912.70 → 4914.30] There are still big upgrades.
[4914.44 → 4921.34] The 4090 is an enormous upgrade over the 3090 for 1600 US dollars.
[4921.46 → 4921.72] Yeah.
[4922.08 → 4922.88] Starting at,
[4923.12 → 4923.82] starting at.
[4923.88 → 4925.36] For a single component of your computer.
[4925.54 → 4926.92] But here we're talking about,
[4927.16 → 4927.98] I hope.
[4928.54 → 4928.80] Okay.
[4928.80 → 4934.16] I hope we're talking about a device that is under or around a grand.
[4934.86 → 4935.10] Right.
[4935.28 → 4936.64] And that's for the whole thing.
[4936.76 → 4936.96] Device.
[4937.12 → 4937.30] Yes.
[4937.36 → 4937.56] Yes.
[4937.56 → 4938.90] It's a complete experience.
[4938.90 → 4943.00] It's not an add-in board that you put in another thing.
[4943.08 → 4943.34] Yeah.
[4943.40 → 4944.96] That also costs a lot of money.
[4944.96 → 4945.24] Right.
[4945.24 → 4948.22] And also like needs its own level of heightened support.
[4948.22 → 4950.22] Because you need like a crazy power supply and.
[4950.38 → 4950.78] Exactly.
[4951.24 → 4951.68] Solid cooling.
[4951.84 → 4952.56] And also the kind of stuff.
[4952.64 → 4953.08] Exactly.
[4953.08 → 4954.60] No,
[4954.74 → 4954.94] I'm,
[4954.94 → 4955.52] I'm,
[4955.52 → 4956.30] I'm jazzed.
[4956.34 → 4960.40] And don't imagine for a second that if ASUS is successful with the DOG
[4960.40 → 4960.70] Ally,
[4961.20 → 4962.90] that you're not going to see other,
[4962.90 → 4966.66] other PC manufacturers chime in because this is something I was trying to
[4966.66 → 4967.18] figure out.
[4967.28 → 4967.56] It's like,
[4967.56 → 4969.10] who the heck is Aya Neo?
[4969.68 → 4970.96] Who is one X player?
[4971.36 → 4971.88] Who is,
[4972.00 → 4972.44] you know,
[4972.68 → 4973.62] a GPD?
[4973.88 → 4974.14] Like who,
[4974.14 → 4975.58] who are these guys?
[4976.20 → 4977.24] And I,
[4977.24 → 4978.76] I know who they are.
[4978.80 → 4979.12] Like I,
[4979.26 → 4979.50] you know,
[4979.52 → 4980.78] have communicated with them.
[4980.88 → 4982.04] I understand who they are.
[4982.04 → 4982.92] You actually very directly know.
[4982.92 → 4985.48] But my point was that they are not ASUS.
[4985.70 → 4986.62] They're not major players.
[4986.66 → 4988.24] They are not MSI gigabyte.
[4988.52 → 4991.10] And if these guys can get to market,
[4991.66 → 4996.00] if the minimum order quantities and the relationship building with the AMD's
[4996.00 → 5000.28] or the Intel's of the world is so relatively easy,
[5000.88 → 5006.54] absolutely nothing would prevent a manufacturer with the expertise of an
[5006.54 → 5007.76] ASUS MSI gigabyte,
[5008.28 → 5008.70] Acer,
[5009.14 → 5009.76] Dell,
[5009.98 → 5010.40] whoever,
[5011.28 → 5012.66] nothing would prevent them.
[5012.92 → 5015.10] From coming out with one.
[5015.80 → 5015.90] Like,
[5015.94 → 5016.12] okay.
[5016.52 → 5017.50] Do you think this is going to be bad?
[5017.50 → 5017.62] Let's go.
[5017.72 → 5018.54] It's a laptop,
[5018.78 → 5019.46] but it doesn't full.
[5019.54 → 5019.76] Sure.
[5020.40 → 5022.26] Do you think it's going to be bad for the GPDs,
[5022.32 → 5022.80] Aya Neo's,
[5022.90 → 5023.18] et cetera,
[5023.18 → 5023.60] of the world?
[5023.76 → 5023.92] Yeah.
[5024.74 → 5025.36] That sucks.
[5025.76 → 5026.14] Hold on.
[5026.14 → 5030.60] They still have an opportunity to maintain their niche.
[5030.60 → 5030.62] They still have an opportunity to maintain their niche.
[5031.16 → 5035.86] GPD is the only one who really takes the keyboard seriously.
[5036.96 → 5037.32] Okay.
[5037.52 → 5038.04] So there's,
[5038.10 → 5039.26] there's still room for them.
[5039.26 → 5042.02] Aya Neo,
[5042.02 → 5046.34] they were doing some really cool things with Aya space.
[5046.98 → 5047.74] So their,
[5047.74 → 5049.46] their skin slash launcher,
[5049.88 → 5052.52] some really cool ideas.
[5052.72 → 5054.04] Their overlay,
[5054.46 → 5059.00] really cool ideas there for being able to kind of like the steam deck,
[5059.10 → 5059.32] right?
[5059.38 → 5064.58] Adjust your brightness and your volume and your power profile and whatever else
[5064.58 → 5065.64] while you're in game.
[5065.64 → 5066.22] Uh,
[5066.22 → 5067.68] really cool ideas there.
[5067.84 → 5069.90] I feel like compared to,
[5070.08 → 5071.28] I don't know,
[5071.38 → 5071.62] six,
[5071.74 → 5072.40] eight months ago,
[5072.50 → 5076.78] it's just kind of more bloated and buggy and hasn't really added anything
[5076.78 → 5078.10] useful for me.
[5078.36 → 5085.04] And so if they can really do a great job of that and make that supplementary to
[5085.04 → 5087.18] anything that Microsoft builds into windows,
[5087.38 → 5089.62] I think it could be perfect.
[5089.80 → 5090.92] Like Aya at their,
[5091.08 → 5095.10] Aya Neo at their best has had way better auto switching.
[5095.10 → 5095.84] Everything of,
[5095.84 → 5096.32] uh,
[5096.44 → 5100.60] joy to mouse and then switching into controller mode as you launch games and
[5100.60 → 5101.76] then go back to the Windows desktop.
[5102.30 → 5105.40] But then it got really bad around the time Windows 11 launched,
[5105.50 → 5107.52] which I would have to assume is something to do with Microsoft.
[5107.52 → 5108.40] Thank you very much.
[5108.40 → 5109.98] But I don't know that for sure.
[5110.70 → 5112.94] Whereas ASUS right now,
[5113.10 → 5113.80] it's pretty rough.
[5113.94 → 5114.98] I basically just use a touchscreen,
[5115.52 → 5115.66] right?
[5115.92 → 5116.46] Like it sucks.
[5116.48 → 5117.62] Like they have a toggle for it,
[5117.64 → 5118.62] but as far as I can tell,
[5118.64 → 5119.12] it doesn't work.
[5119.28 → 5119.52] And there's,
[5119.68 → 5120.56] there's room for these companies.
[5120.68 → 5123.66] There's absolutely room for these companies to have acquisitions happen.
[5123.66 → 5124.10] You,
[5124.22 → 5125.28] you even mentioned like,
[5125.74 → 5128.12] there's all these major players in the space that could do it,
[5128.12 → 5131.26] but there's like software advantages or whatever that these small companies
[5131.26 → 5131.46] have.
[5131.56 → 5133.86] That's like exactly why those things happen.
[5134.00 → 5134.08] Yeah.
[5134.10 → 5134.54] A hundred percent.
[5134.92 → 5135.98] But then if I'm,
[5136.06 → 5136.74] I,
[5136.82 → 5137.94] I don't think it would though.
[5138.06 → 5138.90] Like I'm,
[5138.90 → 5141.80] I'm thinking of everything I know about MSI and their product development.
[5141.90 → 5142.04] Oh,
[5142.06 → 5143.14] I don't think MSI would do it.
[5143.26 → 5144.24] I think they would just,
[5144.32 → 5145.22] they just be like,
[5145.32 → 5145.70] no,
[5145.74 → 5146.48] we'll do it ourselves.
[5146.48 → 5148.18] And it doesn't matter if it's crappy,
[5148.18 → 5149.52] but like alienware.
[5149.64 → 5149.82] Okay.
[5152.50 → 5152.94] Would,
[5153.34 → 5154.10] would Dell?
[5154.34 → 5154.50] No,
[5154.62 → 5157.16] Dell would build it themselves, and it would be less crappy.
[5157.54 → 5158.96] But then MSI.
[5159.12 → 5159.34] Yeah.
[5162.46 → 5162.90] Dang.
[5163.44 → 5166.62] What is it about hardware companies and just being utterly unable to do
[5166.62 → 5167.00] software?
[5167.12 → 5168.76] It's actually like,
[5169.46 → 5172.64] I don't find that there's a ton of companies that can do both.
[5172.94 → 5174.76] It's actually kind of difficult to cross over.
[5174.76 → 5175.20] Yeah.
[5175.20 → 5175.42] Yeah.
[5175.44 → 5175.68] They're like,
[5175.76 → 5176.52] why is Apple,
[5176.68 → 5176.86] you know,
[5176.92 → 5179.04] the first to cross a trillion dollar valuation?
[5179.40 → 5179.54] Yeah.
[5179.62 → 5180.82] Because they can do both.
[5181.04 → 5181.76] It's hard.
[5185.36 → 5185.88] Yeah.
[5185.92 → 5192.38] Intel software is like their consumer facing software is kind of Jacky.
[5192.38 → 5193.98] Do we want to talk about the
[5193.98 → 5195.00] the arc stuff?
[5195.08 → 5195.52] Yeah.
[5195.76 → 5196.28] Yeah.
[5197.12 → 5200.80] Like there's definitely software things that I'm pretty sure Intel does
[5200.80 → 5201.44] pretty well.
[5201.44 → 5202.00] Like my,
[5202.00 → 5206.08] my understanding is a lot of their like compiler stuff is very robust.
[5206.22 → 5210.30] A lot of their like hardcore behind the scenes type of stuff is pretty
[5210.30 → 5210.68] solid.
[5210.84 → 5212.22] A lot of their user facing stuff,
[5212.48 → 5215.76] the UIs look like they're from the early two thousands.
[5216.36 → 5216.84] Um,
[5217.00 → 5217.76] whatever he was even,
[5217.90 → 5222.10] that's when they work art control or whatever was a hot pile of garbage.
[5222.50 → 5222.68] Yeah.
[5222.76 → 5223.22] Um,
[5224.18 → 5224.70] I don't know.
[5224.70 → 5230.14] They feel extremely not modern on the user side or completely broken in
[5230.14 → 5230.58] regards to,
[5230.64 → 5232.32] when you look at like a software company,
[5232.32 → 5234.00] like Facebook trying to do hardware,
[5234.30 → 5234.56] it's like,
[5234.64 → 5234.76] Oh,
[5234.82 → 5235.12] portal.
[5235.58 → 5236.10] Yeah.
[5236.70 → 5237.34] Like it's,
[5237.40 → 5238.90] it's actually pretty hard to cross.
[5239.00 → 5239.24] I mean,
[5239.24 → 5240.92] they technically do hardware now,
[5240.92 → 5247.64] but they acquired Oculus, and what have they realistically launched as meta?
[5247.64 → 5250.36] Like developed and launched.
[5250.80 → 5251.20] Okay.
[5251.36 → 5254.00] So I mean,
[5254.10 → 5254.32] yeah,
[5254.32 → 5255.04] they've done headsets.
[5255.18 → 5255.58] They still,
[5255.68 → 5255.80] yeah,
[5255.82 → 5258.84] but they still had a lot of the Oculus team when they developed,
[5258.92 → 5259.26] you know,
[5259.40 → 5261.58] Rift S or when they developed quest one.
[5261.68 → 5261.76] Oh,
[5261.78 → 5262.14] I see.
[5262.42 → 5262.78] Um,
[5262.82 → 5264.60] so the pro is like the only,
[5264.92 → 5265.38] yeah.
[5265.58 → 5265.84] Yeah.
[5265.84 → 5269.00] And it's a flop.
[5269.10 → 5270.82] As far as I can tell that doesn't,
[5270.90 → 5272.02] it's not a bad device,
[5272.02 → 5273.60] but it's not commercially viable.
[5274.10 → 5276.00] Someone's saying their driver support is normally amazing.
[5276.12 → 5276.28] Yeah.
[5276.28 → 5276.66] Like the
[5276.66 → 5278.44] the behind the scenes stuff from Intel is,
[5278.50 → 5279.82] is traditionally quite good.
[5280.02 → 5280.36] Yeah.
[5280.58 → 5282.10] I will a hundred percent give them that.
[5282.36 → 5283.54] It's more of the
[5283.54 → 5285.26] the user facing stuff.
[5286.04 → 5286.52] Anyway,
[5286.66 → 5287.12] new topic.
[5287.12 → 5289.34] Just like our sponsors face our users.

[5397.80 → 5398.32] Finally,
[5398.44 → 5400.08] the show is brought to you by Sea sonic.
[5400.52 → 5405.96] Sea sonic's Prime TX 1000 power supply delivers the power that you need.
[5406.10 → 5408.96] It features an 80 plus titanium efficiency rating.
[5409.12 → 5411.36] That means less power gets wasted during power conversion.
[5411.36 → 5417.56] It's fully modular and features hybrid fan control to keep overall fan noise under control.
[5417.68 → 5419.58] It also uses a fluid dynamic bearing fan,
[5419.70 → 5421.76] which contributes to quietness and also to longevity.
[5422.16 → 5423.92] It comes with a 12-year warranty.
[5424.22 → 5425.12] So if you're looking for,
[5425.26 → 5428.24] to build a new system and looking for a power supply you can rely on,
[5428.48 → 5428.92] trust me,
[5429.20 → 5430.64] you can trust Sea sonic.
[5431.18 → 5431.50] I mean,
[5431.66 → 5431.88] yeah,
[5432.06 → 5433.76] these guys have been at it as long as I have.
[5434.38 → 5435.88] They were founded the same year I was born.
[5436.36 → 5436.66] Oh wow.
[5436.80 → 5436.94] Yeah.
[5437.04 → 5440.18] Learn more about them at Seasonic.com or through the link down below.
[5440.18 → 5442.54] It was always really confusing to me,
[5442.72 → 5443.26] Sea sonic,
[5443.42 → 5445.54] the fact that they had no retail presence.
[5445.66 → 5447.46] Like I'm talking 15 years ago or whatever,
[5447.82 → 5453.10] when it was obvious that everyone who made a decent power supply was using either them
[5453.10 → 5456.18] or a handful of other OEMs.
[5456.78 → 5457.40] And I'm kind of going,
[5458.24 → 5459.18] let me buy direct,
[5459.28 → 5459.42] man.
[5459.42 → 5461.60] Is it really that hard to,
[5461.70 → 5466.44] to spray a coat of black paint on your boring gray power supply?
[5467.06 → 5470.50] Put a little bit of sleeving on the cable and make a box,
[5470.70 → 5471.68] you know?
[5471.92 → 5473.36] Cause as far as I can tell,
[5473.80 → 5476.14] that's what everyone else is doing.
[5476.34 → 5476.68] Apparently,
[5476.80 → 5478.14] Sea sonic had the same idea.
[5478.96 → 5479.26] It's like,
[5479.30 → 5479.70] okay.
[5480.58 → 5481.92] I guess we'll do that.
[5481.98 → 5483.06] It really doesn't seem that hard.
[5483.06 → 5485.58] Why are we letting Corsair have all the fun?
[5485.68 → 5486.40] Which I'm happy about.
[5486.44 → 5490.52] Cause something that I legitimately used to do was look into who made the power supply
[5490.52 → 5495.98] I was buying to figure out what the like basically cheapest actually Sea sonic option was at the time.
[5496.08 → 5496.22] Yeah.
[5496.56 → 5497.74] And then just buy that.
[5498.02 → 5499.28] So now it's just more simple.
[5499.42 → 5499.54] Yeah.
[5499.54 → 5502.14] Like when XFX broke into the power supply market,
[5502.30 → 5504.22] their whole claim to fame was,
[5504.32 → 5504.86] uh,
[5504.88 → 5508.16] unlike Corsair who has moved on and is using other OEMs now,
[5508.28 → 5509.64] all of ours are Sea sonic.
[5509.86 → 5510.00] Yeah.
[5511.56 → 5512.00] Okay.
[5512.24 → 5514.38] Actually a selling point for a bunch of people.
[5514.52 → 5518.06] I would totally do an LTT power supply just made by Sea sonic.
[5518.14 → 5518.54] I'd be super,
[5518.54 → 5519.60] I'd be super into that.
[5519.90 → 5521.20] And I wouldn't even hide it.
[5521.22 → 5521.58] I'd be like,
[5521.86 → 5522.02] yeah,
[5522.06 → 5524.18] it costs more so that we get our cut.
[5524.24 → 5525.20] It's Sea sonic.
[5525.94 → 5528.16] It's now like partially orange or something.
[5528.50 → 5528.64] Yeah,
[5528.64 → 5529.04] exactly.
[5530.52 → 5530.88] No,
[5531.00 → 5531.16] no.
[5531.20 → 5532.28] Because it would have to be RGB.
[5532.48 → 5533.66] So it matches everyone's system.
[5533.80 → 5536.16] It's just that the RGB would be configured out of the box.
[5536.34 → 5536.86] By default.
[5537.00 → 5537.12] Yeah,
[5537.16 → 5537.48] there we go.
[5537.52 → 5537.66] Yeah.
[5537.68 → 5537.78] There,
[5537.78 → 5538.94] that's what makes it LTT.
[5539.14 → 5539.32] Boom.
[5539.48 → 5539.68] Done.
[5539.96 → 5540.32] Easy.
[5541.10 → 5542.12] But then at that point,
[5542.14 → 5544.82] why don't we just sell Sea sonic power supplies on LTT store.com?
[5544.92 → 5545.12] Hey,
[5545.92 → 5546.76] there's a plan.
[5549.58 → 5549.82] Yeah.
[5550.08 → 5550.52] I'd be down.
[5550.60 → 5550.88] They're good.
[5551.32 → 5554.08] Three merch messages is apparently the current task.
[5554.18 → 5554.58] All right.
[5555.10 → 5556.42] Hit us with some merch messages,
[5556.56 → 5556.90] but Dan,
[5557.14 → 5557.64] all right.
[5557.64 → 5559.52] This one is a little bit anonymous.
[5559.52 → 5560.20] Obviously,
[5560.20 → 5562.46] and is probably directed towards Luke.
[5563.26 → 5565.70] Is AI generated adult content,
[5565.82 → 5569.82] a more ethical solution than current adult industry and only fans?
[5570.14 → 5570.48] Wow.
[5570.98 → 5571.46] Wow.
[5571.46 → 5572.50] what a quagmire.
[5572.78 → 5573.14] Wow.
[5573.50 → 5573.80] All right.
[5573.84 → 5573.98] Well,
[5573.98 → 5575.28] I'm glad you said this was,
[5575.28 → 5575.68] um,
[5575.78 → 5576.18] pun intended,
[5576.26 → 5576.54] by the way.
[5576.76 → 5578.76] I'm glad you said this was directed at Luke.
[5579.94 → 5581.54] Just going to dodge that bullet.
[5581.96 → 5582.36] Um,
[5582.36 → 5583.90] Oh,
[5583.98 → 5584.74] wow.
[5584.74 → 5586.60] Let's let the internet freak out at you for a change.
[5586.60 → 5586.72] Let me,
[5586.76 → 5588.26] let me reread this.
[5589.08 → 5592.82] More ethical solution than current adult industry.
[5592.88 → 5593.76] There's a lot to unpack.
[5593.76 → 5594.38] Only fans.
[5594.44 → 5596.24] There is a ton to unpack here.
[5596.44 → 5599.78] I think it would be less ethical in a bunch of ways,
[5599.96 → 5601.96] potentially more ethical in other ways.
[5602.06 → 5603.38] I think it's super convoluted.
[5603.90 → 5604.34] Um,
[5604.34 → 5611.28] there are definitely only fans things.
[5611.54 → 5612.06] Wow.
[5612.14 → 5615.40] This entirely depends on how you define your ethics there.
[5615.40 → 5621.68] I have seen a lot of people comment about how only fans has enabled certain
[5621.68 → 5626.66] creators to be much more safe in what they do to have more ownership over
[5626.66 → 5627.28] their own stuff.
[5627.36 → 5629.16] They don't have to work through other companies anymore.
[5629.36 → 5632.36] They don't have to necessarily work with other people at all anymore.
[5632.36 → 5634.90] They can just operate on their own regard.
[5635.06 → 5637.02] So I've heard good things about that.
[5637.12 → 5638.72] Does AI solve that?
[5638.98 → 5639.16] No.
[5640.32 → 5641.46] So I don't know.
[5641.78 → 5642.22] Um,
[5642.46 → 5645.48] also there's a topic we're going to be talking about later,
[5645.48 → 5646.28] more specifically,
[5646.28 → 5647.04] uh,
[5647.04 → 5648.16] in the realm of music,
[5648.16 → 5651.12] but AI has been AI models,
[5651.26 → 5651.52] whatever,
[5651.72 → 5652.40] um,
[5653.22 → 5659.26] has been used to like deep fake people that gave no consent and were
[5659.26 → 5661.60] clearly not okay with it at all.
[5661.60 → 5664.30] So that's clearly ethically bad.
[5664.36 → 5665.46] I don't care where your ethics lie.
[5665.56 → 5666.94] That's just clearly not okay.
[5667.46 → 5667.94] Um,
[5668.58 → 5672.92] and these AI models are trained off of image data sets that include real
[5672.92 → 5673.26] people.
[5673.38 → 5677.86] Are they capable of generating stuff completely originally?
[5678.46 → 5678.84] Um,
[5679.02 → 5679.26] well,
[5679.30 → 5682.22] they're going to base it off of things that they learned from people,
[5682.22 → 5683.60] but it could look genuinely,
[5684.62 → 5687.06] literally nothing like anyone else that currently exists.
[5687.06 → 5689.12] So that's cool.
[5689.12 → 5689.60] I guess.
[5691.48 → 5692.64] My understanding,
[5692.84 → 5694.52] not that I speak from personal experience,
[5694.68 → 5697.90] but my understanding is that the pornography industry is extremely
[5697.90 → 5702.54] predisposed towards exploitive practices.
[5702.88 → 5703.08] Yeah.
[5703.22 → 5704.98] I've heard a lot of very bad things,
[5705.10 → 5706.86] which kind of checks out,
[5707.06 → 5708.88] but I've also heard that there are good things,
[5708.88 → 5712.66] but you might be against the entire thing.
[5712.66 → 5715.96] So I don't know.
[5716.74 → 5717.46] I mean,
[5717.48 → 5718.12] at the end of the day,
[5718.12 → 5719.86] there's a fine line between,
[5719.86 → 5720.84] um,
[5720.96 → 5721.38] you know,
[5722.04 → 5726.88] understanding that people have agency and can make their own decisions.
[5726.88 → 5727.44] Yes.
[5727.44 → 5731.44] While also protecting people who would make extremely,
[5732.40 → 5732.44] um,
[5733.10 → 5734.44] self harmful decisions,
[5734.44 → 5735.38] um,
[5735.60 → 5739.30] that would allow them to be exploited by ne'er-do-wells.
[5739.44 → 5744.52] Also bad people saying that certain person involved with something has their own agency
[5744.52 → 5746.04] and is free when that person isn't.
[5746.14 → 5747.58] It's totally a thing that happens.
[5747.60 → 5748.44] That's totally bad.
[5748.68 → 5748.92] Yep.
[5749.18 → 5749.64] Um,
[5750.20 → 5751.78] this is a minefield.
[5751.88 → 5752.56] Let's move on.
[5754.58 → 5755.50] Next question.
[5755.70 → 5756.02] Really?
[5756.02 → 5757.74] Because I was going to throw another curveball at you.
[5757.82 → 5758.36] I was going to say,
[5758.36 → 5760.06] even if the AI generated,
[5760.76 → 5761.22] um,
[5761.38 → 5763.54] even if the AI generated content.
[5763.84 → 5764.24] Sure.
[5764.78 → 5769.18] Only accidentally looked like someone and wasn't intentionally trained on an individual.
[5769.58 → 5770.92] That's still a problem.
[5771.94 → 5772.32] How do you,
[5772.42 → 5774.20] how could you even prevent that?
[5774.30 → 5777.66] But then there's also people that look like other people.
[5777.78 → 5778.08] Yeah.
[5778.36 → 5780.38] That label their stuff as that other person.
[5780.38 → 5780.40] Oh,
[5780.40 → 5780.52] right.
[5780.60 → 5781.50] And that's totally a thing.
[5781.68 → 5781.88] Yep.
[5782.18 → 5782.62] Okay.
[5784.30 → 5785.52] This is a minefield.
[5785.78 → 5786.00] All right.
[5786.02 → 5786.44] See you later.
[5786.54 → 5787.76] Let's move on.
[5788.78 → 5789.26] Okay.
[5789.40 → 5790.02] Up next.
[5790.48 → 5790.84] Uh,
[5791.48 → 5791.72] Hey,
[5791.78 → 5793.66] DLL as calibration tech,
[5793.84 → 5794.22] uh,
[5794.40 → 5795.66] as a calibration tech,
[5795.72 → 5799.28] I often see settings hidden behind proprietary information.
[5799.48 → 5800.84] Do you feel this is okay?
[5800.84 → 5803.04] Or should it fall under right to repair?
[5803.26 → 5805.96] And will the lab's equipment be calibrated?
[5806.62 → 5806.82] Well,
[5806.98 → 5807.28] okay.
[5807.28 → 5807.30] Okay.
[5807.30 → 5808.00] For starters,
[5808.00 → 5810.74] the lab's equipment must be calibrated because otherwise,
[5810.74 → 5813.02] how could we trust any of the results that come out of it?
[5813.92 → 5814.82] For another,
[5815.50 → 5817.86] equipment calibration is a tough one.
[5818.34 → 5819.76] Because on the one hand,
[5819.88 → 5820.12] yes,
[5820.24 → 5821.50] everything is right to repair.
[5821.50 → 5821.94] Uh,
[5821.94 → 5823.54] I saw another merge message about,
[5824.02 → 5824.24] uh,
[5824.24 → 5824.76] for example,
[5825.24 → 5825.74] um,
[5827.00 → 5827.62] uh,
[5827.80 → 5830.94] even just like hidden menus in TVs and stuff like that,
[5830.98 → 5831.10] that,
[5831.10 → 5832.42] that isn't to do with calibration,
[5832.42 → 5836.12] but it's just to access settings that are not considered safe.
[5836.12 → 5836.92] For example,
[5836.92 → 5837.32] uh,
[5837.32 → 5838.06] my LG,
[5838.06 → 5838.90] uh,
[5838.90 → 5840.34] TV that I was using as a monitor,
[5840.34 → 5849.84] there was a special service remote you could get to access a special menu that would allow you to turn off some of the OLED saver technology so that it would function better as a monitor.
[5850.84 → 5851.28] Um,
[5851.72 → 5857.10] obviously I think I should be allowed to use my hardware however I want to use it.
[5857.60 → 5858.62] But on the other hand,
[5859.04 → 5859.26] well,
[5859.32 → 5859.62] who is,
[5859.72 → 5860.90] who is responsible then?
[5860.98 → 5863.32] Who is verifying the integrity of this calibration?
[5864.28 → 5868.86] Unless there's some kind of validation or certification process,
[5868.86 → 5872.16] is it calibrated?
[5875.28 → 5878.88] I could see a compromise being that everyone should have access to the menu.
[5878.88 → 5879.22] So wait,
[5879.26 → 5881.08] are you talking about labs equipment at that point?
[5881.32 → 5881.62] Okay.
[5881.88 → 5882.06] Okay.
[5882.10 → 5882.24] Yeah.
[5882.38 → 5884.10] I'm not talking about the TV anymore.
[5884.18 → 5884.30] No,
[5884.54 → 5884.88] no,
[5884.94 → 5892.16] I could see a compromise being that they allow you to have access to all the same menus and,
[5892.16 → 5892.46] and,
[5892.46 → 5893.26] and IO,
[5893.64 → 5893.96] uh,
[5893.98 → 5895.74] IO ports or whatever else it is.
[5896.22 → 5896.74] Um,
[5897.00 → 5898.80] I think that they should provide,
[5898.86 → 5901.10] the equipment and the training if you want to do it yourself.
[5901.50 → 5912.04] But I think that it could make sense for them to have a program where they're the ones who do it, and they have their own sort of certification that they will apply to it.
[5912.10 → 5912.18] Yeah.
[5912.30 → 5919.64] There could be a log that you can't modify or delete that notes changes made to certain calibration settings.
[5919.64 → 5920.64] Um,
[5920.64 → 5924.38] and whether that change was made by like an improved agent or not,
[5924.38 → 5925.56] because yeah,
[5925.56 → 5927.34] like you should absolutely be able to change it yourself,
[5927.34 → 5931.96] but that doesn't mean it's like verified calibration by whatever authority.
[5931.96 → 5933.40] Um,
[5933.40 → 5934.26] but that might be fine.
[5934.32 → 5935.20] You might not care about that.
[5935.42 → 5937.00] You should still be able to do it in my opinion.
[5940.24 → 5941.00] Do you want another one?
[5941.04 → 5941.18] Yep.
[5941.52 → 5941.88] All right.
[5941.88 → 5942.82] Here's our third.
[5943.82 → 5944.34] Um,
[5944.34 → 5945.98] this one is another anonymous.
[5946.40 → 5946.74] Hey,
[5947.12 → 5947.42] uh,
[5947.46 → 5947.60] Oh,
[5947.70 → 5947.86] no,
[5947.92 → 5949.48] somebody reordered them.
[5949.48 → 5957.10] I think many people are shocked by LTT store prices because they're unfamiliar with the higher end of the markets you compete in.
[5957.30 → 5962.50] Have you ever been shocked by prices in unfamiliar markets before?
[5963.40 → 5963.70] Oh,
[5963.70 → 5964.20] sure.
[5964.46 → 5964.70] Yep.
[5964.76 → 5965.02] I mean,
[5965.02 → 5970.82] I made a whole video about what the heck is going on with cinema camera prices.
[5971.16 → 5974.96] And the craziest part is red was a disruptor.
[5975.38 → 5975.64] Yeah.
[5975.64 → 5975.76] Yeah.
[5979.48 → 5986.34] Get your mind around that red came in and undercut the cinema market,
[5986.48 → 5988.18] the cinema camera market.
[5988.36 → 5989.04] They,
[5989.18 → 5991.94] they democratized the
[5991.96 → 5993.06] the creation of,
[5993.22 → 5993.56] of,
[5993.64 → 5994.60] of high resolution,
[5994.60 → 5996.42] like filmic resolution,
[5996.42 → 5997.82] digital cinema.
[5999.36 → 6004.10] We talked earlier on this show about an MSRP $35,000 graphics card,
[6004.18 → 6005.74] right?
[6006.00 → 6006.28] Yeah.
[6006.28 → 6008.14] That was probably shocking for a bunch of people watching.
[6008.32 → 6008.50] Yeah.
[6008.50 → 6009.30] I mean,
[6009.36 → 6009.68] it's,
[6009.76 → 6010.04] um,
[6010.56 → 6013.70] I remember talking about this on the WAN show at some point.
[6013.76 → 6015.26] I think I talked about this on the WAN show.
[6015.34 → 6020.14] I remember being called very out of touch for saying something along the lines of,
[6020.14 → 6020.74] uh,
[6020.74 → 6022.94] consumer computer hardware is not expensive.
[6023.28 → 6024.08] Oh yeah.
[6024.50 → 6027.60] Because from a business standpoint,
[6027.84 → 6029.68] it's not.
[6029.68 → 6032.24] a GPU in the
[6032.24 → 6032.56] when,
[6032.56 → 6032.94] when you,
[6033.02 → 6034.16] you have to,
[6034.38 → 6035.28] everything is relative,
[6035.28 → 6035.70] right?
[6036.84 → 6037.98] A GPU,
[6038.54 → 6038.92] okay.
[6039.36 → 6043.68] Costs nothing to an organization like us in the grand scheme of things.
[6043.68 → 6045.10] Think about how many people work here.
[6045.10 → 6045.98] Compared to employee salary.
[6046.24 → 6046.60] We're,
[6046.66 → 6047.98] we're up to about benefits.
[6049.10 → 6049.58] For,
[6049.72 → 6050.14] for,
[6050.52 → 6055.48] for someone to be in the building for a pay period.
[6055.48 → 6056.46] Okay.
[6056.62 → 6057.18] It was like,
[6057.18 → 6059.22] GPU.
[6059.58 → 6059.86] Right.
[6060.02 → 6060.62] And then,
[6060.82 → 6061.20] okay,
[6061.44 → 6063.00] well that times,
[6063.44 → 6063.88] uh,
[6063.90 → 6065.94] 26 times a year.
[6068.30 → 6069.84] Like it still matters.
[6069.98 → 6070.14] Yeah.
[6070.14 → 6076.46] Like every headcount we add is like equipping a quarter of our staff with an RTX 4090.
[6076.46 → 6078.52] Think about that.
[6078.52 → 6078.68] Yeah.
[6078.68 → 6078.84] Yeah.
[6078.84 → 6078.98] Yeah.
[6079.20 → 6079.50] Right.
[6079.68 → 6082.44] So consumer electronics,
[6082.68 → 6087.26] what I meant was for what they are,
[6087.46 → 6090.20] it's amazing how little they cost.
[6090.20 → 6095.94] When we look at what we got for a thousand dollars back in 1995,
[6097.06 → 6098.48] the fact that you can,
[6098.58 → 6101.78] the fact that you can buy a 40,
[6102.04 → 6106.44] 70 TI for a thousand dollars is much,
[6106.44 → 6107.12] mind-blowing.
[6107.76 → 6109.10] The technological advancements.
[6109.42 → 6109.54] Right.
[6109.72 → 6109.80] The
[6109.80 → 6110.62] I think the
[6110.62 → 6114.84] the like most easy to visualize version of that was when you talk about storage,
[6114.92 → 6116.22] people do this all the time.
[6116.32 → 6117.54] So this is not original at all,
[6117.54 → 6120.66] but you look at like old hard drives.
[6120.80 → 6128.36] Like this is how many hard drives it would have taken in 1998 to amass a terabyte worth of data.
[6128.98 → 6129.46] Yeah.
[6129.46 → 6132.12] And there's like a one terabyte micro SD card.
[6132.16 → 6132.56] Here you go.
[6132.76 → 6133.04] It's like,
[6133.24 → 6133.66] Whoa.
[6133.76 → 6134.28] It's wild.
[6134.48 → 6134.70] Yeah.
[6134.72 → 6135.92] People are talking about this now.
[6135.92 → 6138.48] It's like a DS 2600 and float plane chat says,
[6138.58 → 6141.64] I just bought a Cisco router for 1.2 million for my company.
[6141.98 → 6143.24] Is that outrageous?
[6143.98 → 6147.76] Not if your company is going to generate $6 million of revenue with it.
[6148.08 → 6149.16] Cause that's the thing.
[6149.24 → 6151.60] It's a completely different calculus.
[6152.02 → 6157.12] It's not how much enjoyment will I get from this router or from this add-in card.
[6157.12 → 6160.16] It's how much revenue will this generate for the company?
[6160.16 → 6163.06] If I spend these thousand dollars that I am,
[6163.18 → 6165.68] that I'm blessed enough to have to reinvest,
[6165.84 → 6173.56] will I get $1,100 or $1,500 or $3,000 assuming that I make very efficient use of it.
[6173.56 → 6177.02] So I forget how we started this question.
[6177.70 → 6178.54] What was the question?
[6179.44 → 6179.76] Oh yeah.
[6179.84 → 6180.70] The pricing of,
[6180.80 → 6181.32] so have we ever,
[6181.40 → 6181.54] yeah.
[6181.92 → 6182.12] Yeah.
[6182.22 → 6183.12] So in the
[6183.58 → 6184.48] when it comes to,
[6184.48 → 6184.72] to,
[6184.82 → 6185.02] to,
[6185.12 → 6186.38] to business expenses,
[6186.38 → 6193.70] I don't think a quarter goes by where I'm not blown away by the cost of something.
[6193.70 → 6195.66] Because once you reach a certain scale,
[6196.10 → 6199.36] things that cost a thousand dollars become a rounding error.
[6199.52 → 6205.82] Like I remember we got a bill for some kind of stock photo service that we were using,
[6205.82 → 6210.66] but we didn't have the right tier of subscription for like how much of it we were using.
[6210.66 → 6211.60] And we didn't realize.
[6212.10 → 6214.70] And they sent us like a $30,000 bill.
[6217.18 → 6219.18] And I was like,
[6220.08 → 6220.78] uh,
[6221.14 → 6223.58] what?
[6223.86 → 6226.48] This happens with a web service stuff like all the time.
[6226.56 → 6226.96] Oh yeah,
[6227.06 → 6227.54] for sure.
[6227.76 → 6227.94] Yeah.
[6228.42 → 6228.72] Yeah.
[6228.82 → 6229.58] So yeah,
[6229.58 → 6230.44] it happens all the time.
[6230.54 → 6231.50] And I mean,
[6231.50 → 6236.50] my response to people saying that LTT store stuff is really expensive is,
[6236.84 → 6237.16] um,
[6237.24 → 6237.58] okay,
[6237.68 → 6237.96] well,
[6238.12 → 6238.40] uh,
[6238.40 → 6238.58] you,
[6238.68 → 6242.34] you go make it to that level of quality at that price.
[6242.34 → 6242.86] Our,
[6242.86 → 6244.44] our t-shirts are still 20 bucks.
[6245.02 → 6245.88] Go find,
[6246.14 → 6246.50] now,
[6247.06 → 6251.70] go find me another content creator that does printed quality shirts.
[6251.86 → 6252.66] No fruit of the loom,
[6252.66 → 6253.66] no Gilda,
[6253.72 → 6254.68] no crap shirts,
[6255.48 → 6256.86] printed quality shirts.
[6256.86 → 6257.74] With good printing too.
[6257.80 → 6258.36] 20 bucks.
[6258.66 → 6259.30] Screen printed,
[6259.44 → 6260.30] not direct to garment.
[6261.18 → 6262.84] It costs money.
[6264.66 → 6265.06] Sorry,
[6265.18 → 6265.72] not sorry.
[6266.44 → 6267.46] Like we,
[6267.50 → 6268.04] we don't,
[6268.12 → 6270.34] we don't take ridiculous margin on stuff.
[6271.20 → 6271.60] Um,
[6271.60 → 6273.70] that's just the way it is.
[6276.78 → 6277.68] We're doing one more.
[6277.76 → 6278.36] Are we doing topics?
[6278.64 → 6279.32] Let's do one more.
[6280.12 → 6280.48] Actually,
[6280.60 → 6280.76] yeah,
[6280.76 → 6281.42] let's do one more.
[6281.86 → 6282.62] We're ahead of time.
[6284.30 → 6285.36] We're ahead of time.
[6286.48 → 6286.86] Yeah,
[6286.90 → 6287.82] just a little bit.
[6288.26 → 6288.64] I,
[6288.74 → 6289.04] uh,
[6289.32 → 6290.34] I got my times wrong.
[6290.34 → 6291.06] All right.
[6291.12 → 6292.52] Next up's from Jacob.
[6293.10 → 6293.40] Linus,
[6293.48 → 6297.00] who is a source of personal or professional inspiration for you?
[6297.08 → 6298.10] Not a role model,
[6298.26 → 6301.62] just someone with certain traits you admire and try to emulate.
[6302.18 → 6303.38] Strange as it may seem,
[6303.78 → 6304.74] you're on my list.
[6305.68 → 6305.82] Oh,
[6305.92 → 6306.12] well,
[6306.16 → 6307.24] I'm very flattered.
[6307.54 → 6308.04] Thank you.
[6308.54 → 6308.96] Um,
[6308.96 → 6310.00] bad choice.
[6310.18 → 6310.60] Just kidding.
[6315.96 → 6316.48] No,
[6317.04 → 6319.98] you're going to do the like rubbing thing.
[6320.24 → 6320.60] No,
[6320.98 → 6321.64] I refuse.
[6321.80 → 6322.20] Um,
[6322.64 → 6324.42] oh man.
[6325.68 → 6327.34] My thing,
[6327.96 → 6328.52] um,
[6328.62 → 6332.26] is that I don't have a lot of time.
[6333.02 → 6337.02] I follow very few things.
[6337.46 → 6337.84] Um,
[6337.84 → 6338.08] yeah.
[6338.96 → 6339.98] So I'm,
[6340.04 → 6344.66] I'm at risk right now of saying a name only to find out.
[6344.78 → 6346.14] This is a huge problem.
[6346.30 → 6346.50] Yeah.
[6346.64 → 6349.42] I was at a Michael Bublé concert a little while back.
[6349.62 → 6349.80] Yeah.
[6349.94 → 6355.18] And he does a whole tribute to Elvis Presley and what a great person he was.
[6355.18 → 6355.68] And I was like,
[6355.82 → 6357.26] no,
[6357.28 → 6358.02] that doesn't sound right.
[6358.08 → 6358.44] Is that true?
[6358.62 → 6358.82] Yeah.
[6359.60 → 6359.94] Oh,
[6360.34 → 6360.78] oh,
[6361.38 → 6363.44] I have no idea.
[6364.80 → 6365.32] I,
[6365.32 → 6368.14] I believe you from everything.
[6368.14 → 6370.98] I can glean all these years later,
[6370.98 → 6371.52] you know,
[6371.52 → 6372.48] with the
[6372.48 → 6373.82] the wonderful world of,
[6373.88 → 6374.20] of,
[6374.28 → 6375.64] of Wikipedia and,
[6375.78 → 6376.02] you know,
[6376.44 → 6377.74] memoirs and knowing that he's,
[6377.80 → 6378.08] you know,
[6378.84 → 6381.46] deceased and not able to defend himself these days.
[6382.88 → 6383.64] Real creep.
[6384.10 → 6385.08] Oh boy.
[6385.22 → 6385.48] Okay.
[6385.62 → 6385.76] Yeah.
[6385.76 → 6387.14] I've music innovator.
[6387.58 → 6387.98] Certainly.
[6388.18 → 6388.48] Sure.
[6388.78 → 6390.32] I thought he is like stole that too.
[6390.64 → 6391.32] Real creep.
[6391.90 → 6392.26] Um,
[6392.34 → 6392.96] I don't know.
[6392.96 → 6393.82] I know nothing about it.
[6393.92 → 6394.10] Yeah.
[6394.34 → 6394.98] You know,
[6394.98 → 6395.24] there's,
[6395.32 → 6399.00] there's the whole like 14-year-old girlfriend and Oh boy.
[6399.10 → 6401.42] Super cool stuff like that.
[6401.42 → 6401.98] Um,
[6401.98 → 6403.00] and I don't think you can,
[6403.26 → 6406.74] I don't think you can really just different time hand wave that away.
[6406.94 → 6409.50] So I'm kind of at risk right now.
[6409.80 → 6410.00] Yeah.
[6410.06 → 6416.12] But what I would like to say is maybe what I could do is I could point to a
[6416.12 → 6416.88] couple of,
[6416.88 → 6417.22] of,
[6417.28 → 6420.72] of role models that seem pretty okay from what I've seen.
[6421.08 → 6421.50] Uh,
[6421.52 → 6423.58] the Sedan brothers who played,
[6423.80 → 6424.12] uh,
[6424.12 → 6425.16] for the Vancouver Canucks,
[6425.32 → 6428.10] not a huge organized sports fan these days,
[6428.10 → 6431.82] just because if it's,
[6431.82 → 6432.46] and again,
[6432.46 → 6434.60] this might just be my cynicism showing through,
[6434.60 → 6439.24] but I just can't help but look at it as yet another business full of
[6439.24 → 6444.10] brands owned by billionaires who don't even treat this as their main
[6444.10 → 6444.52] project.
[6444.52 → 6445.32] In a lot of cases,
[6445.32 → 6448.90] it's just like a silly little side vanity project for them.
[6448.90 → 6449.60] Like it's just,
[6449.66 → 6453.34] it all just kind of sucks the way the players are treated like cattle,
[6453.74 → 6454.52] well-paid cattle,
[6454.72 → 6455.72] well-compensated cattle.
[6455.72 → 6456.48] In a lot of cases,
[6456.80 → 6457.80] sometimes not,
[6458.10 → 6458.70] um,
[6458.86 → 6459.42] but cattle,
[6459.42 → 6460.28] uh,
[6460.32 → 6460.58] it,
[6460.66 → 6462.32] the whole thing just makes me really uncomfortable,
[6462.32 → 6467.52] but the Sedan brothers seem to be actually pretty cool.
[6467.96 → 6468.36] Um,
[6468.42 → 6468.68] yeah.
[6468.84 → 6469.04] Oh,
[6469.14 → 6473.42] a Born says you've mentioned Bill Watterson before a hundred percent for
[6473.42 → 6473.54] all.
[6473.54 → 6474.46] I know he kills cats.
[6474.80 → 6475.28] Um,
[6475.82 → 6477.44] I don't know him personally,
[6477.44 → 6477.78] right?
[6477.78 → 6478.74] Like I don't know him.
[6479.00 → 6479.40] Um,
[6479.40 → 6480.64] they say never meet your heroes.
[6480.94 → 6482.22] I'm pretty sure.
[6482.22 → 6483.26] There's also a difference.
[6483.44 → 6483.66] Like,
[6483.78 → 6486.02] I don't know for me,
[6486.12 → 6486.92] people in this position,
[6486.92 → 6488.90] it doesn't mean I fanboy over them.
[6489.74 → 6491.12] I'd fanboy over Bill Watterson.
[6491.98 → 6492.38] Yeah.
[6492.46 → 6492.58] They,
[6492.58 → 6492.74] they,
[6492.80 → 6493.34] they got me.
[6493.52 → 6494.52] They got me on that one.
[6497.24 → 6498.30] He seems pretty cool.
[6498.46 → 6499.90] Fanboy is a pretty intense term.
[6499.90 → 6500.68] I,
[6500.80 → 6502.50] if you take it to like its potential,
[6502.50 → 6503.38] my hands would be shaking.
[6504.22 → 6504.62] Okay.
[6505.10 → 6505.56] Like I,
[6505.84 → 6507.10] but like I,
[6507.18 → 6508.02] I play it cool,
[6508.02 → 6510.40] but like I would have to be consciously playing it cool.
[6510.50 → 6511.84] Studied this person's life.
[6512.64 → 6513.00] No,
[6513.14 → 6514.08] their works maybe,
[6514.22 → 6515.04] but their life.
[6515.16 → 6518.66] Like I know enough about his personal life to know that he maintains a
[6518.66 → 6519.14] pretty quiet.
[6519.14 → 6519.40] Yeah.
[6519.40 → 6521.40] but that's like somewhere blasted everywhere.
[6521.40 → 6522.46] If you ever look up his name.
[6522.86 → 6523.12] Yeah.
[6523.12 → 6524.08] But I've looked up his name.
[6524.18 → 6524.40] So I,
[6524.56 → 6524.80] you know,
[6524.80 → 6525.70] I've gone that far.
[6525.82 → 6525.96] Yeah.
[6525.96 → 6526.26] I don't know.
[6526.28 → 6528.72] I think people could take this stuff pretty far,
[6528.84 → 6531.02] but maybe I'm applying too much to it.
[6531.32 → 6531.50] Yeah.
[6531.50 → 6533.40] People are suggesting some pretty decent,
[6534.28 → 6534.40] um,
[6534.98 → 6536.90] people have got some pretty decent suggestions.
[6537.12 → 6537.28] You know,
[6537.32 → 6537.58] Mr.
[6537.64 → 6541.68] Rogers actually seems to have legitimately just been a good,
[6541.92 → 6542.94] decent human being.
[6542.94 → 6544.10] Um,
[6544.98 → 6548.22] yeah.
[6548.64 → 6549.04] Yeah.
[6550.80 → 6552.12] Good luck meeting Bill Watterson.
[6552.18 → 6552.80] He's like the phantom.
[6552.94 → 6553.06] Yeah.
[6553.18 → 6553.38] Yeah.
[6554.18 → 6554.62] 100%.
[6554.62 → 6554.86] I,
[6554.92 → 6557.66] I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't even do a book tour for his
[6557.66 → 6558.64] upcoming graphic novel,
[6558.68 → 6559.76] which I have pre-ordered,
[6559.88 → 6561.84] even though I always say don't pre-order.
[6564.84 → 6565.50] All right.
[6568.98 → 6570.08] Two to three more topics.
[6572.36 → 6572.80] Yeah.
[6573.38 → 6573.94] All right.
[6574.00 → 6574.32] Hit me.
[6575.88 → 6577.66] I don't even know if we have three more topics.
[6578.78 → 6579.18] Oh,
[6579.26 → 6579.58] okay.
[6579.72 → 6581.36] The RTX 4070 was released.
[6582.06 → 6583.12] And can I say,
[6583.28 → 6586.24] I think we finally managed to nail a GPU review.
[6586.84 → 6587.26] Yeah.
[6588.04 → 6588.68] I think you can.
[6589.14 → 6589.38] We,
[6589.52 → 6589.86] uh,
[6590.18 → 6590.52] yeah,
[6590.64 → 6590.94] we,
[6591.50 → 6592.08] we,
[6592.08 → 6592.16] we,
[6592.16 → 6593.54] we managed to get all the
[6593.66 → 6598.50] all the synergies lined up between the lab and the writing team.
[6599.00 → 6599.48] Um,
[6599.58 → 6601.60] they've got a lot of their data collection.
[6601.60 → 6603.40] It's nailed down better.
[6603.76 → 6603.98] Uh,
[6603.98 → 6609.64] we've got a lot of our processes in terms of ingesting that data and turning it into
[6609.64 → 6613.20] the important beats that matter in video form,
[6613.20 → 6613.80] uh,
[6613.80 → 6618.52] rather than just being a written article that we read out to the camera.
[6618.52 → 6626.06] So I think we managed to maintain the LTT soul while also authoritatively speaking,
[6626.06 → 6632.32] based on rock solid data about what you need to know about this product.
[6632.32 → 6640.74] I think we did a great job of figuring out where the RTX 4070 fits in both Nvidia's plan,
[6640.86 → 6643.90] and in sort of gamers worlds.
[6644.26 → 6644.62] Um,
[6644.62 → 6647.38] I'm really,
[6647.78 → 6648.58] really happy.
[6648.90 → 6654.22] The next level for us is to have supplementary written articles on LTT labs.com,
[6654.32 → 6655.86] but that's,
[6656.22 → 6657.54] we've got it in our sites.
[6658.10 → 6659.82] It doesn't need to happen yet.
[6660.06 → 6660.40] Um,
[6660.40 → 6661.22] I think there's,
[6661.28 → 6667.74] I think there's room for us to go in more depth in the right medium for that kind of additional
[6667.74 → 6668.16] depth.
[6668.16 → 6675.96] But that is what I want a GPU review video to be what you need to know with good energy
[6675.96 → 6676.86] in a
[6676.86 → 6678.50] in a non-confusing way.
[6678.94 → 6679.32] Um,
[6679.60 → 6684.88] and I'm really glad that we did manage to nail it on the RTX 4070 because there was a ton of room
[6684.88 → 6686.28] for us to get this one wrong.
[6686.66 → 6687.14] Uh,
[6687.18 → 6690.80] I think that we did a better job than we've done in the past of presenting both sides of
[6690.80 → 6691.26] the story.
[6691.38 → 6697.60] I think that during the GPU pricing crisis that took place during the pandemic,
[6697.60 → 6698.60] we,
[6698.96 → 6701.80] we were kind of,
[6701.80 → 6705.28] I don't know,
[6705.50 → 6707.90] realists about the situation.
[6708.48 → 6708.92] Like,
[6709.04 → 6709.44] yeah.
[6709.90 → 6710.30] Um,
[6711.02 → 6712.40] the only answer is wait.
[6712.40 → 6713.06] And like,
[6713.16 → 6713.48] sorry,
[6713.68 → 6716.40] but people didn't like me saying,
[6716.50 → 6716.60] look,
[6716.60 → 6717.94] there's nothing I can do about this.
[6718.34 → 6719.54] This is the way that it is.
[6719.86 → 6722.62] And in the context of the market as it is right now,
[6722.64 → 6723.52] this is a good deal.
[6723.96 → 6724.36] Or,
[6724.70 → 6725.30] you know,
[6725.30 → 6725.66] like I,
[6725.76 → 6726.22] like I could,
[6726.22 → 6727.72] I could sit and complain about this,
[6727.76 → 6728.68] but it's not going to do anything.
[6728.84 → 6731.74] People didn't like sort of that defeatist sort of attitude.
[6732.50 → 6732.86] Um,
[6733.54 → 6736.24] but then we also can't just whine.
[6736.48 → 6736.88] Yeah.
[6736.94 → 6738.02] That's not constructive.
[6738.02 → 6741.64] It does absolutely nothing other than be fatiguing.
[6741.70 → 6742.08] I understand.
[6742.20 → 6743.06] For everyone who's near it.
[6743.26 → 6743.84] But it's just,
[6743.94 → 6744.08] yeah,
[6744.12 → 6744.40] there's,
[6744.76 → 6746.52] there is genuinely nothing we can really do.
[6746.66 → 6751.18] So I feel like what we did better with the RTX 4070 is we empathized better.
[6751.18 → 6751.96] Um,
[6751.96 → 6752.34] there was,
[6752.40 → 6753.54] there was one video in particular.
[6753.54 → 6755.48] I can't remember which one it was where we just,
[6755.60 → 6756.34] we did a
[6756.42 → 6757.36] we did kind of a
[6757.36 → 6758.72] a postmortem on it, and we went,
[6758.80 → 6758.90] okay,
[6758.90 → 6759.06] well,
[6759.08 → 6760.40] what did we get wrong here?
[6760.40 → 6763.00] Because we didn't say anything that was actually incorrect,
[6763.00 → 6765.44] but people didn't want to hear it.
[6765.44 → 6771.40] And I'm reminded of that bit in Rick and Morty where Rick says something.
[6771.54 → 6772.54] I don't remember what it is.
[6772.62 → 6772.92] Um,
[6772.92 → 6774.52] and Morty basically says,
[6774.66 → 6775.28] you know,
[6775.36 → 6775.54] yeah,
[6775.56 → 6777.72] no one cares if you're right because you're a right.
[6779.08 → 6779.52] Um,
[6779.52 → 6781.52] and so we kind of looked at it, and we went,
[6781.60 → 6781.72] yeah,
[6781.72 → 6782.18] this was,
[6782.28 → 6783.20] this was a little bit,
[6783.34 → 6784.88] so it was a little too abrasive.
[6784.88 → 6785.68] Like we've got to,
[6785.78 → 6789.92] we've got to take a more empathizing tone where we're delivering the bad news.
[6789.92 → 6790.62] The 4070,
[6790.72 → 6794.32] the bad news is that this is a super tepid GPU.
[6794.96 → 6795.02] Yeah.
[6795.02 → 6795.80] Um,
[6796.22 → 6800.24] but we're finding a way to tell the good parts of the story and that,
[6800.34 → 6803.62] in that it is the best value we've seen in a long time.
[6805.84 → 6808.06] So if you must have a GPU today,
[6808.18 → 6809.32] kind of lame as that is,
[6809.32 → 6809.62] yeah,
[6809.62 → 6812.42] I guess you're good to go.
[6813.08 → 6813.56] Um,
[6813.86 → 6816.16] or you could pick up a 6,800 just saying.
[6816.52 → 6816.86] Um,
[6816.86 → 6818.12] so if you must have a GPU today,
[6818.12 → 6818.74] I guess it's,
[6818.80 → 6819.16] it's,
[6819.26 → 6819.64] you know,
[6819.64 → 6822.54] the best deal from Nvidia and in quite some time,
[6822.54 → 6825.00] but we're tempering that.
[6825.00 → 6833.92] With the reality that Nvidia shapes the GPU market and can make something a good deal or a bad deal.
[6833.92 → 6836.44] Anyway,
[6836.64 → 6837.58] there's a blah,
[6837.58 → 6837.70] blah,
[6837.72 → 6839.78] blah launched this week to deeply mixed reception.
[6839.94 → 6842.04] Nvidia has been advertising it as a major jump.
[6842.48 → 6842.84] Uh,
[6842.84 → 6843.60] but I mean,
[6843.60 → 6847.06] that's only in games that support DLSS three frame generation.
[6847.06 → 6847.88] I,
[6848.00 → 6848.28] I,
[6848.28 → 6848.60] I,
[6848.60 → 6848.62] I,
[6848.62 → 6849.56] I mean,
[6849.56 → 6850.36] I'm calling it,
[6850.46 → 6850.84] I guess.
[6850.94 → 6854.20] I don't think that's ever going to take off in the competitive scene.
[6854.66 → 6856.22] I just don't think it's realistic.
[6856.54 → 6856.82] Yeah.
[6857.14 → 6857.88] More latency,
[6858.14 → 6858.88] more bad,
[6859.16 → 6863.00] especially if you're going to spend a half of your time talking out of this side of your mouth,
[6863.06 → 6863.50] marketing,
[6863.76 → 6864.20] you know,
[6864.26 → 6865.26] Nvidia reflex.
[6865.26 → 6870.26] You can't spend the other half of your time talking out of this side of your mouth with,
[6870.26 → 6870.62] you know,
[6870.74 → 6871.92] DLSS three,
[6872.04 → 6872.88] the beautification.
[6873.18 → 6876.10] As long as you're talking to two very different gamers,
[6876.10 → 6877.22] then I guess it's okay.
[6877.86 → 6879.90] But for competition,
[6880.04 → 6881.52] DLSS three is never going to matter.
[6881.86 → 6882.14] Um,
[6882.14 → 6883.18] for experiential games,
[6883.26 → 6884.66] it might get pretty okay.
[6884.66 → 6885.86] Um,
[6886.20 → 6886.40] yeah,
[6886.42 → 6887.82] because without frame generation,
[6887.82 → 6890.76] it's closer to a 1.3 X performance increase.
[6890.88 → 6895.18] The new graphics card is also a hundred dollars more expensive than the previous gen card was at launch,
[6895.18 → 6901.82] despite the fact that discrete graphic sales have been dropping for over a year and hit a 20-year low last financial quarter.
[6903.10 → 6903.54] Um,
[6903.90 → 6910.06] discussion question here is what do the shrinking differences between graphics card generations mean for the future of the market?
[6910.20 → 6910.50] I mean,
[6910.90 → 6912.76] longer upgrade cycles.
[6912.92 → 6913.24] Yeah.
[6913.24 → 6914.46] longer upgrade cycles.
[6914.46 → 6915.36] And I think,
[6915.56 → 6916.04] um,
[6916.16 → 6920.38] a shift from game developers towards targeting a lower spec,
[6920.48 → 6920.70] right?
[6920.70 → 6921.26] Like we're not,
[6921.32 → 6923.16] I don't think we're ever going to see a crisis again.
[6923.72 → 6925.24] C R Y S I S.
[6925.48 → 6926.80] I don't think we're ever going to see,
[6926.92 → 6934.74] I don't think we're going to ever have that moment again where a game developer goes out of their way to create a game that literally nothing on the market can run.
[6936.16 → 6937.48] Cause why would you do that?
[6937.52 → 6939.86] You'd be so much better off targeting the steam deck.
[6940.50 → 6940.90] Yeah.
[6940.90 → 6948.44] You can create a pretty visually stunning game that will run on the steam deck and has this built in audience of people sitting there on their handhelds going,
[6948.54 → 6949.86] what am I going to play on this thing now?
[6950.04 → 6950.70] Let's go.
[6950.70 → 6952.30] It's,
[6952.30 → 6952.58] it's,
[6952.58 → 6952.60] it's,
[6952.60 → 6952.84] it's,
[6952.92 → 6954.26] it's the console mentality.
[6954.26 → 6954.52] It's,
[6954.58 → 6955.62] it's totally different.
[6956.24 → 6956.64] Right.
[6956.68 → 6957.22] I also just,
[6957.34 → 6960.30] I think that's been kind of the idea for quite a while,
[6960.30 → 6961.16] to be honest,
[6961.64 → 6962.50] like a long time.
[6962.66 → 6962.84] Yeah.
[6962.84 → 6963.08] I mean,
[6963.08 → 6964.86] look at the super popular games right now.
[6964.86 → 6967.46] The word we have for it is e-sports titles.
[6967.46 → 6967.82] Yeah.
[6968.08 → 6970.24] It's targeting e-sports tier.
[6970.40 → 6977.78] So basically making sure that it can run on anything and then adding some bells and whistles that realistically nobody's going to turn on anyway because they want to compete.
[6978.32 → 6978.70] Yeah.
[6979.40 → 6980.04] And they're all,
[6980.10 → 6982.04] it's all like Fortnite and stuff.
[6982.40 → 6982.60] Like,
[6983.30 → 6983.90] I don't know.
[6984.42 → 6984.72] Yeah.
[6984.72 → 6985.84] Not difficult at all to run.
[6985.84 → 6992.22] There was a friend of mine who was shopping for a laptop recently, and they were asking about like specs of dedicated GPUs.
[6992.72 → 6993.98] And they mentioned like,
[6994.42 → 6995.56] these are the games that I play.
[6995.68 → 6995.94] I'm like,
[6995.98 → 6996.08] yeah,
[6996.10 → 6997.76] you don't need a dedicated GPU.
[6997.78 → 6998.28] Then don't upgrade.
[6998.82 → 6999.08] Well,
[6999.16 → 6999.42] well,
[6999.42 → 6999.58] they,
[6999.62 → 7000.60] they do need a laptop,
[7000.72 → 7002.64] but they don't need a dedicated GPU in their laptop.
[7002.76 → 7002.96] Right.
[7003.08 → 7004.20] Because they don't have a laptop right now.
[7004.26 → 7005.54] They need a laptop in general.
[7005.62 → 7005.84] Right.
[7005.92 → 7006.98] But like the games that the player,
[7007.10 → 7008.16] like little indie titles.
[7008.58 → 7008.76] Yeah.
[7008.76 → 7010.04] Speaking of vampire survivors,
[7010.04 → 7012.06] I'm pretty sure I could run that on onboard graphics.
[7012.16 → 7012.32] Yeah.
[7012.32 → 7012.82] So like,
[7012.88 → 7013.22] whatever.
[7013.22 → 7014.48] It's like that type of stuff.
[7014.48 → 7015.02] And then,
[7015.02 → 7016.08] original,
[7016.34 → 7017.26] like whatever it was,
[7017.58 → 7019.02] 1999 Ever Quest.
[7019.50 → 7019.76] I'm like,
[7019.82 → 7020.06] yeah,
[7020.38 → 7021.02] that'll run fine.
[7021.52 → 7021.76] Like,
[7022.14 → 7022.46] whatever.
[7022.62 → 7024.04] People are talking about cyberpunk,
[7024.16 → 7025.44] some of the Sony ports.
[7025.88 → 7029.80] The difference is that Crisis wasn't just poorly optimized.
[7030.06 → 7030.46] Ha!
[7031.16 → 7031.54] Get owned.
[7031.88 → 7034.60] It was also a leap forward visually,
[7034.80 → 7038.28] the likes of which we saw at times.
[7038.76 → 7041.14] Like Half-Life 2 wasn't such a visual leap.
[7041.14 → 7042.98] It was more of just like,
[7042.98 → 7045.36] it was a gameplay leap for sure.
[7047.00 → 7048.90] Doom from that era was,
[7049.36 → 7049.90] what was it?
[7049.94 → 7050.92] Doom 3 or whatever.
[7051.10 → 7052.66] The one at that time was,
[7052.66 → 7055.68] was like visually really cool when you had your flashlight on.
[7057.00 → 7057.44] Like,
[7057.48 → 7058.12] I'm trying to think like,
[7058.20 → 7058.32] what,
[7058.40 → 7058.84] what was,
[7058.94 → 7059.76] what was like really,
[7060.02 → 7061.20] really mind-blowing?
[7064.20 → 7064.50] I mean,
[7064.60 → 7066.04] Far Cry blew my mind.
[7066.04 → 7068.96] It was the first like next gen shooter of,
[7069.06 → 7069.40] of the
[7069.40 → 7070.68] the big three at the time,
[7070.78 → 7071.20] which was your,
[7071.28 → 7071.94] your Half-Life 2,
[7072.00 → 7072.54] your Doom 3,
[7072.54 → 7073.40] and your Far Cry.
[7073.62 → 7073.88] And no,
[7073.88 → 7074.70] no one saw it coming.
[7074.80 → 7075.26] It came out of nowhere.
[7075.36 → 7076.28] That's Creek again.
[7077.84 → 7078.24] I,
[7078.32 → 7081.04] I am not that familiar with stuff that came before though,
[7081.04 → 7087.48] because I wasn't really a PC gamer other than just like 2D casual games until,
[7087.48 → 7088.16] you know,
[7089.46 → 7090.84] ATI is 99,
[7090.84 → 7091.84] 9,000 series,
[7091.92 → 7093.14] the old 9,000 series.
[7093.42 → 7095.16] When I got a discrete GPU,
[7095.30 → 7095.82] like I didn't,
[7096.02 → 7096.94] I played some stuff,
[7097.06 → 7099.58] but I wasn't purchasing hardware.
[7100.08 → 7103.22] So it was just like whatever the computers that my dad had could run.
[7104.46 → 7104.90] Yes.
[7105.04 → 7107.06] Back then it was like descent and like old school,
[7107.20 → 7108.50] like Civ one and stuff like that.
[7108.64 → 7108.94] You know what?
[7109.02 → 7112.98] Cyberpunk has that ray tracing overdrive mode that I guess,
[7113.50 → 7114.52] I guess is that,
[7114.62 → 7115.42] but I almost,
[7115.78 → 7116.18] I don't know.
[7116.24 → 7116.66] Maybe I'm,
[7116.66 → 7117.92] maybe I'm looking at this wrong,
[7118.14 → 7120.80] but I don't really see that as part of the base game.
[7121.14 → 7125.42] The same way that just like a graphic slider at release was like where you,
[7125.54 → 7128.30] where it came out targeting hardware that didn't exist.
[7128.42 → 7129.66] That's why I said that that's new.
[7129.74 → 7130.28] Like it's,
[7130.34 → 7131.04] it doesn't seem fair.
[7131.10 → 7132.26] They're more trying to keep up.
[7133.10 → 7134.86] But that's not a bad,
[7134.94 → 7135.80] that's not a bad thing.
[7135.90 → 7136.46] They're doing it.
[7136.58 → 7136.68] Yeah.
[7136.68 → 7140.32] I was also going to mention that everyone that I currently know that plays
[7140.32 → 7146.60] Cyberpunk are people that also play like star citizen and whatever.
[7146.60 → 7146.96] else.
[7146.96 → 7149.82] And you can tell like the reason why they like playing games is so they can make
[7149.82 → 7150.92] that GPU burn.
[7150.92 → 7151.92] Um,
[7152.20 → 7152.88] and they,
[7152.96 → 7157.78] they want like super hyper visual realism and like all this other type of stuff.
[7157.84 → 7160.40] Not necessarily because they're actually like enjoying the game.
[7160.56 → 7160.88] Right.
[7160.92 → 7162.34] So they're basically a or a Jake.
[7162.48 → 7162.74] Yeah.
[7162.94 → 7165.68] They like setting things up and like seeing them run.
[7165.84 → 7166.98] Like morphologists.
[7167.40 → 7167.52] We,
[7167.60 → 7168.70] we played star citizen with him.
[7168.96 → 7169.06] I,
[7169.14 → 7170.16] he posted some screenshot,
[7170.26 → 7170.50] but like,
[7170.54 → 7170.68] wow,
[7170.76 → 7171.62] cyberpunk's amazing.
[7171.62 → 7173.32] Because he turned on the new ray tracing thing.
[7173.32 → 7173.96] And I was like,
[7174.00 → 7174.20] yep.
[7174.68 → 7175.04] Yep.
[7175.76 → 7176.00] Not,
[7176.08 → 7176.74] not surprised.
[7177.74 → 7178.72] That makes sense.
[7179.78 → 7180.26] Yeah.
[7180.50 → 7180.94] New topic.
[7182.08 → 7182.64] Oh yeah.
[7182.64 → 7182.88] Right.
[7183.00 → 7183.46] New topic.
[7186.14 → 7187.18] This is great.
[7187.18 → 7189.56] Universal Music Group.
[7189.76 → 7190.04] Um,
[7190.22 → 7191.50] saw this on Ars Technica.
[7191.78 → 7192.06] Yeah.
[7192.20 → 7196.60] Demands that platforms block AI scraping of music.
[7197.74 → 7198.14] Um,
[7198.40 → 7205.70] so they have apparently told streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify to block AI services
[7205.70 → 7209.56] from scraping melodies and lyrics from songs that it holds the copyright to.
[7211.42 → 7211.98] Bro.
[7211.98 → 7217.52] That's insanely like impossibly hard to do.
[7218.00 → 7218.48] Also,
[7219.22 → 7220.94] just utterly.
[7223.80 → 7224.08] Well,
[7224.12 → 7225.96] I'm looking for a word in effect.
[7226.16 → 7227.04] Like what,
[7227.12 → 7229.54] what's the strongest possible word for ineffective?
[7230.34 → 7230.90] Futile.
[7231.04 → 7232.26] Let's go with futile.
[7233.38 → 7235.82] Do you imagine?
[7236.76 → 7237.36] Okay.
[7238.32 → 7239.18] That there,
[7239.36 → 7239.56] that,
[7239.64 → 7240.02] that,
[7240.02 → 7241.54] that just because,
[7241.54 → 7245.12] Spotify and Apple Music block this,
[7245.58 → 7250.58] that there is no other way to train these music generation AIs on your songs.
[7250.76 → 7252.14] If you can play a song,
[7252.24 → 7254.34] there's no way to capture that sound.
[7254.82 → 7255.92] It's actually impossible.
[7256.08 → 7260.16] You definitely cannot capture the sound of something that you play through your device.
[7260.34 → 7260.50] No,
[7260.58 → 7260.88] I mean,
[7260.88 → 7263.68] we'd have to invent like a diaphragm that,
[7263.80 → 7267.30] that kind of senses air,
[7267.40 → 7269.06] like sonic air vibrations.
[7269.06 → 7270.06] That sounds far too complicated.
[7270.38 → 7270.62] Um,
[7270.62 → 7271.58] I mean,
[7271.64 → 7272.12] how could,
[7273.06 → 7273.22] how,
[7273.38 → 7273.50] but,
[7273.60 → 7275.12] but how could you possibly,
[7275.44 → 7279.44] how could you possibly turn that vibration into,
[7279.74 → 7280.88] into a signal though?
[7281.22 → 7282.20] Especially when like,
[7282.42 → 7282.70] it's,
[7282.70 → 7283.46] it's streaming,
[7283.68 → 7287.44] it's technically being like downloaded to your computer in a raw data state.
[7287.82 → 7288.02] I mean,
[7288.02 → 7289.06] how could you get that?
[7289.24 → 7289.68] Look,
[7289.68 → 7291.00] to produce waves.
[7291.00 → 7291.10] Look,
[7291.18 → 7291.48] I mean,
[7291.68 → 7292.10] no,
[7292.24 → 7292.46] that's,
[7292.52 → 7293.38] that's impossible.
[7293.68 → 7293.74] But,
[7293.84 → 7294.46] but back,
[7294.56 → 7295.06] back to the
[7295.16 → 7295.46] hold on.
[7295.50 → 7298.80] I think I've got an idea back to the idea of the vibrating diaphragm.
[7299.16 → 7300.00] Maybe if there,
[7300.14 → 7301.82] maybe if you had magnets involved somehow,
[7301.92 → 7302.20] but then.
[7302.20 → 7304.12] How are you going to manufacture things this precise?
[7304.20 → 7305.20] You'd need some kind of,
[7305.20 → 7307.78] you'd need some kind of conductive material though,
[7308.26 → 7311.82] that could carry whatever signals back to some kind of recording device.
[7311.94 → 7312.94] So we're back to your problem.
[7313.02 → 7314.08] We would need a recording device.
[7314.08 → 7317.30] You might need an interface in between there as well to like properly.
[7317.30 → 7317.44] Oh,
[7317.44 → 7318.22] it would wear out.
[7318.64 → 7318.98] Yeah.
[7319.24 → 7319.54] It would,
[7319.58 → 7323.36] it would wear out because you'd have to have electrons flowing through it.
[7323.64 → 7324.06] That's,
[7324.12 → 7324.64] that's a problem.
[7324.72 → 7325.10] And it would,
[7325.42 → 7326.80] it would constantly fail.
[7326.86 → 7328.46] Like electrons are basically like,
[7328.46 → 7329.30] they're like energy.
[7329.30 → 7331.54] I don't know if physics will ever be able to answer this question.
[7331.56 → 7331.58] Because they're,
[7331.58 → 7333.34] they're mass, and they have a charge.
[7333.46 → 7335.76] They're like both sides of E equals MC squared.
[7335.90 → 7336.22] Right.
[7336.74 → 7337.88] They're mass and energy.
[7338.16 → 7338.44] Yeah.
[7339.58 → 7341.00] You can't balance that equation.
[7344.30 → 7344.70] Anyway.
[7344.70 → 7349.58] So they've been sending out many takedown notices against AI
[7349.58 → 7354.84] generated songs that come from AI's trained on copyrighted materials.
[7355.14 → 7357.38] According to a Universal Music spokesperson,
[7358.04 → 7362.02] we have a moral and commercial responsibility to our artists to work,
[7362.12 → 7365.36] to prevent the unauthorized use of their music and to stop platforms from
[7365.36 → 7368.48] ingesting content that violates the right of artists and other creators.
[7368.68 → 7372.60] We expect our platform partners will want to prevent their services from being
[7372.60 → 7374.62] used in ways that harm artists.
[7374.70 → 7375.46] Noble goal.
[7375.60 → 7376.42] It just doesn't matter.
[7376.82 → 7377.12] Oh yeah.
[7377.18 → 7378.60] It's like the six-month pause thing.
[7378.70 → 7379.08] It's like,
[7379.16 → 7379.36] yeah,
[7379.50 → 7381.04] I understand why you would want this.
[7381.12 → 7383.24] I understand why universal media group would,
[7383.42 → 7385.02] would Universal Music group.
[7385.10 → 7385.26] Sorry.
[7385.34 → 7386.86] I applied our own naming scheme to them.
[7388.14 → 7390.10] I understand why they would want to do this.
[7390.16 → 7393.34] It's just completely irrelevant and futile.
[7393.34 → 7393.96] Like you mentioned,
[7393.96 → 7396.24] it just doesn't matter.
[7396.80 → 7398.14] Is the discussion question is,
[7398.26 → 7400.24] is Universal Music correct in demanding this?
[7400.56 → 7401.48] Can they even stop it?
[7401.84 → 7402.24] Correct?
[7402.44 → 7402.66] Like,
[7402.66 → 7402.94] yeah,
[7402.94 → 7403.28] probably.
[7403.66 → 7403.84] Sure.
[7404.10 → 7404.36] Yeah.
[7404.58 → 7404.76] Yeah.
[7404.76 → 7405.90] Like from a legal standpoint.
[7406.06 → 7406.18] Yeah,
[7406.24 → 7406.58] for sure.
[7406.70 → 7408.34] They need to try to defend against these things.
[7408.34 → 7409.58] Like if I was writing a
[7409.58 → 7412.88] if I was writing a video platform code,
[7413.00 → 7413.70] okay.
[7413.70 → 7415.60] And I was just like,
[7416.04 → 7416.40] Hmm,
[7416.76 → 7417.08] well,
[7417.14 → 7423.10] why don't I just steal YouTube and Twitch and Netflix's like source code,
[7423.20 → 7427.24] use it to train an AI and then have an AI write a video platform for me.
[7427.24 → 7428.80] I want to start a new streaming platform.
[7428.98 → 7429.70] Even if it's legal,
[7429.74 → 7430.66] it's pretty unethical.
[7431.08 → 7431.26] Yeah.
[7431.88 → 7433.78] Twitch recently had this huge leak.
[7433.84 → 7434.84] I'll just take all their stuff.
[7434.98 → 7435.18] Oh,
[7435.32 → 7435.54] well,
[7435.78 → 7435.96] yeah,
[7436.06 → 7436.20] yeah.
[7436.32 → 7436.68] Okay.
[7436.68 → 7436.96] Yeah.
[7437.12 → 7439.38] So even if it was legal, and you couldn't prove it,
[7439.42 → 7441.16] it's extremely unethical.
[7441.28 → 7441.42] I mean,
[7441.42 → 7441.68] otherwise,
[7441.68 → 7444.74] why would we have intellectual property rights at all?
[7445.34 → 7445.74] Um,
[7446.20 → 7446.44] yeah,
[7446.58 → 7450.74] but can they do anything to stop music from being listened to?
[7451.24 → 7454.50] Imagine being a Universal Music group and that being your goal.
[7454.50 → 7457.06] good luck.
[7457.74 → 7458.30] Yeah.
[7458.40 → 7459.24] Quite the pivot.
[7461.76 → 7462.36] Um,
[7463.58 → 7464.00] Ooh,
[7464.54 → 7466.78] speaking of video streaming platforms,
[7466.90 → 7468.28] we should talk about this.
[7469.00 → 7470.18] It's a little awkward.
[7471.20 → 7472.10] Got the
[7472.18 → 7472.92] Oh yeah.
[7473.48 → 7473.74] Yeah.
[7474.02 → 7474.98] Talk about this.
[7475.08 → 7475.70] I've got,
[7475.80 → 7476.04] uh,
[7476.46 → 7480.20] a float plane C suite at the table with me and,
[7480.20 → 7480.54] uh,
[7480.54 → 7480.78] Ooh,
[7480.82 → 7481.84] he's giving me the look.
[7481.92 → 7482.18] Okay.
[7482.18 → 7484.12] I think I'll focus on you guys.
[7484.50 → 7486.82] Right now,
[7486.92 → 7489.60] please explain the way that we are leaning.
[7490.70 → 7491.14] Okay.
[7491.30 → 7492.18] The way that we're leaning.
[7492.58 → 7493.56] We have a way we're leaning.
[7493.76 → 7494.12] That's a
[7494.20 → 7496.64] that's a way of saying what's happening.
[7496.70 → 7497.40] Someone dropped their phone.
[7497.58 → 7498.42] Oh yeah.
[7498.44 → 7498.82] I'm assuming.
[7499.56 → 7501.76] The writers are having their quarterly,
[7501.76 → 7502.34] uh,
[7502.34 → 7504.04] hangout mesh above us.
[7504.12 → 7507.90] They apparently decided not to go out this time because it's a fixed budget.
[7507.90 → 7509.88] So they decided not to go out anywhere.
[7510.02 → 7512.40] And rather than ordering restaurant food,
[7512.40 → 7514.30] they all went to the grocery store.
[7514.50 → 7518.46] So that they would have way more like snakes and drinks.
[7519.48 → 7522.22] And they're hanging out at the office where there's no cost.
[7522.86 → 7523.30] It's like,
[7523.56 → 7523.94] yeah,
[7523.98 → 7524.72] I got to respect it.
[7524.88 → 7526.20] Give a bunch of engineers a task.
[7526.66 → 7527.54] Let's be efficient.
[7527.88 → 7528.12] Yeah.
[7528.12 → 7528.84] So,
[7528.84 → 7529.18] so anywho,
[7529.34 → 7529.70] um,
[7529.70 → 7531.76] the way that we're leaning hard leaning,
[7531.92 → 7532.36] strong leaning,
[7532.74 → 7533.28] um,
[7533.42 → 7533.62] yeah,
[7533.70 → 7537.94] is that exclusive content,
[7537.94 → 7539.18] um,
[7539.18 → 7544.16] will come to YouTube memberships.
[7544.16 → 7544.76] Flow plane,
[7544.82 → 7545.50] exclusive content.
[7546.14 → 7547.60] That's what we've called it up until now.
[7547.68 → 7547.86] Yes.
[7548.18 → 7548.54] FIX.
[7550.08 → 7552.86] Now I still like my pitch for how to do the naming with this,
[7552.94 → 7553.24] but yeah.
[7553.92 → 7554.18] Oh,
[7554.34 → 7554.62] naming.
[7555.14 → 7555.44] Yeah.
[7555.44 → 7556.06] You didn't see that bit.
[7556.06 → 7556.60] Oh no.
[7556.86 → 7557.20] I,
[7557.32 → 7558.04] I was saying,
[7558.26 → 7559.10] I mean,
[7559.28 → 7560.84] when I explained more before I do this,
[7560.90 → 7563.34] but I was saying we should still call it full plane exclusives.
[7563.78 → 7564.78] And then on YouTube,
[7564.78 → 7565.52] they should be like,
[7565.52 → 7566.46] uh,
[7566.58 → 7567.10] uh,
[7567.56 → 7567.86] Oh,
[7568.04 → 7570.30] what's the proper naming for that these days?
[7570.80 → 7571.04] Member.
[7571.76 → 7572.20] No.
[7572.72 → 7573.12] Um,
[7573.36 → 7573.54] Oh,
[7573.54 → 7574.24] like,
[7574.30 → 7574.46] uh,
[7574.46 → 7574.92] that's what it's called.
[7575.00 → 7575.12] Like,
[7575.20 → 7575.48] uh,
[7575.48 → 7578.32] illicit market exclusives.
[7578.70 → 7579.10] Oh,
[7579.22 → 7579.48] like,
[7579.50 → 7579.72] like,
[7579.72 → 7580.74] like dark web,
[7580.80 → 7581.68] like black market.
[7581.84 → 7582.16] Like,
[7582.16 → 7583.38] I don't think that's the
[7583.64 → 7585.86] I don't genuinely think that term is like not a thing anymore.
[7585.88 → 7586.08] Oh,
[7586.42 → 7587.00] that makes sense.
[7587.06 → 7588.50] But I don't know what replaced it.
[7588.98 → 7589.32] Genuinely.
[7589.50 → 7589.88] I don't know,
[7590.14 → 7591.64] but I think the term isn't a thing anymore,
[7591.64 → 7592.64] but like that,
[7592.90 → 7594.14] whatever the new term is.
[7594.28 → 7594.38] Sure.
[7594.90 → 7595.30] Yeah.
[7595.60 → 7596.94] I think that would be bootleg.
[7597.26 → 7597.96] I don't know.
[7598.24 → 7598.54] Anyway,
[7598.80 → 7599.14] whatever.
[7599.76 → 7603.44] So the reasoning for it is that it's,
[7603.54 → 7611.14] been clear to us for a long time that there's a certain subset of users that are simply not willing to engage off platform.
[7611.50 → 7612.56] Take for example.
[7612.92 → 7613.10] Oh,
[7613.86 → 7616.34] of course it's not there in the tab anymore,
[7616.34 → 7618.48] but I saw someone send a super chat earlier.
[7618.78 → 7619.14] Okay.
[7619.24 → 7619.74] They did.
[7619.92 → 7620.10] Um,
[7620.26 → 7620.88] it was there.
[7620.98 → 7621.42] Trust me,
[7621.86 → 7622.02] bro.
[7622.38 → 7622.82] Um,
[7624.36 → 7625.52] and they,
[7625.60 → 7628.62] they must know by this point that we don't respond to them,
[7628.62 → 7633.06] but just their chosen way of engaging with us is through the YouTube platform.
[7633.06 → 7634.48] It's very low friction.
[7634.80 → 7635.16] Realistically,
[7635.16 → 7637.90] they've already given Google their credit card number.
[7638.02 → 7639.74] They don't have to sign up for a third party service,
[7639.86 → 7640.12] et cetera,
[7640.18 → 7640.48] et cetera,
[7640.54 → 7640.90] et cetera.
[7641.48 → 7643.28] And so for us to not,
[7643.54 → 7647.00] especially since we have memberships activated on our channel,
[7647.14 → 7652.64] for us to not be engaging with those people is a terrible business decision.
[7652.64 → 7654.26] With that said,
[7655.20 → 7660.20] there are certain benefits that we're simply not going to be able to provide on the YouTube platform.
[7660.34 → 7666.30] And there are costs that are higher on the YouTube platform than they are on the float plane platform,
[7666.30 → 7669.22] where our costs are fixed in a sense,
[7669.50 → 7672.96] as opposed to scaling directly with our revenue.
[7672.96 → 7675.36] So the way that we are leaning,
[7675.54 → 7683.06] the way that I think it's going to work going forward is YouTube members will get all the same content,
[7683.30 → 7689.72] all the same exclusive and behind the scenes and extra cutting room floor content that float plane members get.
[7689.72 → 7697.64] But there will be a surcharge to compensate for the YouTube cut since it's like not our platform.
[7697.64 → 7701.86] And there's really nothing in it for us to just take less for some reason,
[7701.86 → 7706.30] because you want to give your credit card to Google and not to us or whatever.
[7706.80 → 7710.02] So there will be a surcharge and there won't be a $5 tier.
[7710.42 → 7719.34] So the $10 4k tier on float plane that gets you access to everything is $10 and is $100 if you buy it for the year.
[7719.72 → 7722.26] And on YouTube, it'll be $12.
[7723.20 → 7727.12] And it also won't include the WAN pre-show GOD.
[7727.56 → 7731.96] So float plane gets like, you know, our sort of test streaming before the show.
[7732.30 → 7733.90] That does not go anywhere else.
[7733.90 → 7739.70] That will still not go to YouTube because there would be no way for us to control if it went to members only
[7739.70 → 7743.98] or if it went to everyone once we make the video either public or members only.
[7744.38 → 7745.90] It would just be the entire video.
[7746.48 → 7748.94] It doesn't include any quality improvements.
[7748.94 → 7752.70] People on float plane often talk about particularly the audio on WAN show,
[7752.78 → 7755.16] how much better it is on float plane compared to on YouTube.
[7755.72 → 7757.34] There's no way for us to do that.
[7757.42 → 7758.82] YouTube is as YouTube does.
[7759.52 → 7762.00] And right, there's no way for us, as far as I can tell,
[7762.04 → 7764.28] if we can figure out a way to do a yearly discount, we will.
[7764.64 → 7767.30] But as far as I can tell, there's no way to do a yearly discount.
[7767.30 → 7773.14] So the point really is going to be to funnel people over to float plane where it's better.
[7774.58 → 7778.58] But this way, at least there's a way for people to engage on YouTube.
[7778.74 → 7783.22] But if the level of convenience to you is just like, you're just like, no, I'm just, I only use YouTube or whatever,
[7783.22 → 7786.20] then you have an option to get our content.
[7786.20 → 7788.62] Yeah, a lot of people are like that.
[7788.70 → 7790.18] And I get it.
[7790.22 → 7795.86] It's like people who shop on Amazon because it's just, they have Prime and it's convenient.
[7796.42 → 7798.42] And they only have to go one place.
[7798.90 → 7804.24] Like, man, ever since I, remember I told you that, you know, one of my resolutions was,
[7804.34 → 7806.60] I'm not going to stop shopping on Amazon outright like you.
[7806.94 → 7807.72] But you'll just like try.
[7807.72 → 7808.20] Admirable.
[7808.50 → 7814.18] But my whole thing now is I do a Google search first, and I click on at least two websites.
[7815.22 → 7820.28] And if it's close to the same price, like I'll pay up to like five, 10 bucks more.
[7820.44 → 7823.02] If it's close to the same price, I buy it somewhere else.
[7825.42 → 7832.52] But if Amazon's position in the world is anything to go by, which it is, most people won't do that.
[7832.52 → 7836.12] One of the frustrating things for me is when there is literally no other option.
[7836.12 → 7839.84] When it's like a company, they like to make the best.
[7839.98 → 7841.74] This is not super common, but it happens.
[7841.88 → 7846.36] They make like the best thing in their space, and it's priced decently well and all that kind of stuff.
[7846.40 → 7850.16] Like it's clearly the best option for this widget that you need to buy for whatever reason.
[7850.66 → 7853.16] But that company only operates through Amazon.
[7853.86 → 7858.48] It's like, that, that sucks.
[7861.48 → 7861.92] Okay.
[7862.20 → 7863.14] Sorry, float plane chat.
[7863.18 → 7864.56] I haven't been meaning to ignore you.
[7864.56 → 7866.98] Rod asks, do you have a lot of memberships on YouTube?
[7867.12 → 7868.08] Understand if you can't answer.
[7868.16 → 7875.78] We actually have about 600 YouTube members and the only benefit that we've really offered to them as other than thanks for supporting the channel.
[7875.78 → 7881.94] So like shout out, like, thank you so much guys is merch discounts that I actually talked to Nick about recently.
[7881.94 → 7883.06] I just don't think are very good.
[7883.06 → 7886.58] So we're going to work on what we can do for...
[7886.58 → 7888.38] We should make sure that...
[7888.38 → 7889.18] Parity, yes.
[7889.28 → 7889.48] Yes.
[7889.64 → 7895.56] For both float plane $10 tier and YouTube members, which are going to be the equivalent tiers.
[7895.74 → 7895.86] Yeah.
[7895.90 → 7899.54] Because YouTube members won't have a reduced cost tier.
[7900.10 → 7900.30] No.
[7900.30 → 7902.52] They won't have like a $5 tier or anything like that.
[7902.62 → 7904.94] Or the OG $3 tier, nothing like that.
[7904.94 → 7915.38] So one of the things that we're going to do is make sure that if we do some kind of discount program, then that will actually make sense.
[7915.94 → 7919.88] Or whether it's, you know, exclusive merch or whatever else the case may be.
[7920.16 → 7924.30] The thing with exclusive merch, guys, is it's like a lot of work to make something good.
[7924.58 → 7929.12] If all we were doing was just putting a logo on a mug or whatever, then yeah, sure, fine.
[7929.12 → 7932.04] We'll do an exclusive one with float plane logo, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[7932.34 → 7939.86] But as it is, when we put a ton of work into it, it's kind of painful to not do a broad release of something.
[7940.34 → 7947.04] Like I'd love to do a float plane exclusive, like super cool, like bomber jacket, you know, or whatever.
[7947.32 → 7951.26] Like, oh, we are not doing that because we'd lose so much money.
[7951.30 → 7952.12] It would make no sense.
[7952.96 → 7953.12] Yep.
[7954.74 → 7955.14] Okay.
[7955.14 → 7958.16] Let me just see if there's any other stuff here.
[7959.12 → 7963.52] Um, does Apple Pay break merch messages?
[7963.70 → 7964.82] Someone says mine didn't go through.
[7964.90 → 7966.34] It's possible we just haven't gotten to it yet.
[7966.44 → 7969.12] Poor Dan, his fingers are on fire trying to reply to them.
[7969.38 → 7971.88] We actually need to talk about merch messages too, guys.
[7971.98 → 7977.06] Merch messages are part of the reason that the show has been drawn out to untenable lengths.
[7977.42 → 7979.00] It's not that we don't want to talk to you guys.
[7979.06 → 7984.06] It's just that we feel kind of obligated, especially when you give us such great discussion topics
[7984.06 → 7987.12] or you ask us, you know, really cool and important questions.
[7987.12 → 7992.68] We feel really obligated to address them and not just, hey, cool merch message, but like
[7992.68 → 7994.48] address them in a, in a meaningful manner.
[7994.92 → 8000.58] Um, but there are a lot of cases where Luke and I can't address every good merch message
[8000.58 → 8000.86] anymore.
[8000.86 → 8002.44] It's just gotten unmanageable.
[8002.44 → 8005.02] And Dan often doesn't know the question.
[8005.18 → 8009.44] So we've been talking internally about what a workflow would look like where Dan has an
[8009.44 → 8011.62] additional stream that he can send things through.
[8011.74 → 8015.94] So right now he can just push it out to the, uh, to the lower third.
[8016.10 → 8016.38] Okay.
[8016.42 → 8018.84] So it's just like, hi mom or whatever else it just goes.
[8019.00 → 8021.24] Uh, or yeah, Joshua H didn't leave a message.
[8021.24 → 8024.50] So it's just like, uh, Joshua H bought an RGB diode t-shirt.
[8024.50 → 8024.82] Cool.
[8024.82 → 8025.26] Cool.
[8025.26 → 8025.84] For 20 bucks.
[8026.34 → 8030.70] Um, then the next one is Dan can reply via text.
[8030.88 → 8034.44] So you'll see, you know, someone's question kind of like that.
[8034.44 → 8038.02] And then there'll be a follow-up one that has an answer of some sort.
[8038.10 → 8039.08] Let's see what Dan said.
[8039.42 → 8041.98] Can't wait for LTX driving up from Oregon state university.
[8042.10 → 8045.04] Do you plan on discontinuing the goals to create as many skills as a kid?
[8045.08 → 8045.78] That's not accurate.
[8046.26 → 8048.12] I don't think I said that.
[8048.82 → 8049.94] Oh, well who replied to that?
[8050.14 → 8050.60] I don't know.
[8051.04 → 8051.42] Was it you?
[8051.64 → 8052.06] It wasn't me.
[8052.06 → 8057.98] No, it could be someone else in the dashboard as not as in like an intruder, but it could
[8057.98 → 8059.06] be somebody else.
[8059.34 → 8062.98] I've been doing something a little bit different this week is I've been leaving a lot of them
[8062.98 → 8065.78] for you guys to maybe respond to via text.
[8066.24 → 8073.32] Uh, because yeah, I haven't been able to give, uh, like a reasonable response to a lot of them.
[8073.56 → 8076.44] So who wrote sunglasses for things confiscated by TSA?
[8076.64 → 8078.66] I didn't, uh, I didn't respond to that one.
[8078.80 → 8079.06] I didn't.
[8079.76 → 8081.88] Somebody else is in here responding to these.
[8082.06 → 8082.36] Who's going?
[8082.52 → 8084.50] Who is replying to merch messages right now?
[8084.50 → 8085.50] It's probably Conrad.
[8086.02 → 8086.88] I would assume so.
[8087.02 → 8089.58] Because I have 85 in the queue right now.
[8090.18 → 8090.62] Okay.
[8090.72 → 8094.36] And I've been going through and removing the ones that are kind of maybe not question related,
[8094.48 → 8097.54] but a lot of these I think you guys could respond to via text.
[8097.54 → 8101.82] So the second path is a text response, kind of like what we're showing you.
[8101.82 → 8106.42] And the third path is that it goes into a queue for me and Luke to discuss.
[8106.42 → 8112.86] Uh, what I think we should do is create a fourth path that will essentially create a customer
[8112.86 → 8116.76] support ticket, and we will get back to people next week.
[8117.18 → 8119.28] Uh, I mean, we already have a customer support team.
[8119.28 → 8120.94] That's like half a dozen people at this point.
[8120.94 → 8122.28] They're not always crazy busy.
[8122.80 → 8127.06] So is there any reason why if your message is something like, you know, Hey, when are
[8127.06 → 8129.14] you guys going to do a float plane exclusive t-shirt or whatever?
[8129.62 → 8133.74] There's no real reason for that to not go to the customer support team where they can
[8133.74 → 8135.04] do something meaningful with it.
[8135.04 → 8140.28] Like compile the most common requests for new items or whatever else, and then relay that to
[8140.28 → 8142.56] the appropriate people here in the organization.
[8142.56 → 8146.36] Because even for me, I can't answer every question that you guys ask.
[8146.84 → 8148.64] Uh, are there plans for an LTD wrist rest?
[8149.24 → 8150.58] I'm using the indoor hoodie.
[8150.82 → 8152.12] Wait, as a wrist rest?
[8152.78 → 8155.68] Um, that's interesting.
[8155.94 → 8156.26] Okay.
[8157.16 → 8157.74] Uh, okay.
[8157.78 → 8159.48] So that, that is an answer.
[8159.56 → 8160.20] That is correct.
[8160.30 → 8163.46] We do not have plans for a wrist rest, but I don't know who's replying, and I don't know
[8163.46 → 8165.40] how they know that or if they know that for sure.
[8165.68 → 8168.06] The, uh, the spaghetti made of meat was me.
[8168.22 → 8168.52] Okay.
[8168.64 → 8169.58] From the previous one.
[8170.00 → 8170.88] Uh, interesting.
[8171.32 → 8174.80] I saw one about what's the weirdest thing you had confiscated by TSA.
[8175.12 → 8176.52] I remember leaving that one.
[8176.56 → 8176.68] Yeah.
[8176.76 → 8180.52] My little tiny, um, my little tiny Genera.
[8180.92 → 8181.56] Hold on.
[8181.88 → 8183.34] It was, it was Conrad.
[8183.46 → 8185.16] He's, he's, it's very good-natured.
[8185.24 → 8189.22] Uh, he can see that there is a massive queue and is just trying to help.
[8189.54 → 8190.02] I see.
[8190.12 → 8190.38] Okay.
[8190.38 → 8193.24] If Conrad is a hundred percent confident and.
[8193.46 → 8194.48] I've already messaged that too.
[8194.54 → 8194.86] Okay.
[8195.08 → 8199.00] Um, please sign it so that we're not sitting here going mystery.
[8199.00 → 8202.44] Who is replying to a dash with your initials?
[8202.44 → 8206.16] Ones that aren't initialled are Dan and then everything else.
[8206.16 → 8208.70] Like when I respond to them, I do LL at the end.
[8208.70 → 8208.86] Yeah.
[8208.86 → 8210.14] I, I, I put my initials.
[8210.14 → 8213.22] I had one of these confiscated actually not that long ago.
[8213.22 → 8215.04] That like makes sense, but it's unfortunate.
[8215.20 → 8215.36] Yeah.
[8215.36 → 8218.94] It's like no more dangerous than a sharp like car key.
[8219.02 → 8219.32] Yeah.
[8219.72 → 8220.12] Realistically.
[8220.30 → 8220.58] Yeah.
[8220.58 → 8223.64] Like you, you, you could, you could, knives are scary.
[8223.84 → 8224.16] Oh yeah.
[8224.20 → 8227.84] Like you could hurt someone very badly with this knife.
[8228.34 → 8233.16] Um, but that's also like clearly a tool, but that's also true of like a sharpened car
[8233.16 → 8235.90] key or a massive variety of other things.
[8235.90 → 8236.18] Yeah.
[8236.60 → 8236.90] Yeah.
[8236.90 → 8239.92] So I, I was pretty bummed cause these, it's a spider coat.
[8239.92 → 8245.04] It's like, it's not a lot of metal, but it's, um, for how small it is, it's not that cheap.
[8245.04 → 8252.28] Um, and I'm really dumb because the last time I lost it, um, I actually had Vance order me
[8252.28 → 8256.20] a new one because I was just like, oh, I mean, this seems like the kind of thing that an assistant
[8256.20 → 8257.16] might do.
[8257.30 → 8258.28] Um, I lost my knife.
[8258.36 → 8259.64] Can you please get me a new one?
[8259.72 → 8261.74] And I gave him the wrong model name.
[8262.16 → 8263.68] So I bought two knives.
[8263.82 → 8265.66] I bought a ladybug and a bug.
[8267.86 → 8268.26] Deep.
[8269.98 → 8270.70] Oh man.
[8270.70 → 8272.56] I don't blame Vance at all.
[8272.68 → 8274.16] I didn't show him the one I lost.
[8274.26 → 8277.94] I just asked for a ladybug and I don't have a ladybug.
[8278.06 → 8278.78] I have a bug.
[8280.18 → 8280.62] Cool.
[8282.20 → 8286.94] Does anyone, does anyone object to that whole turning on YouTube memberships thing?
[8287.04 → 8288.94] Because I was watching flow plane chat.
[8289.02 → 8292.06] I think for the most part, like people get it.
[8292.06 → 8297.76] The, the, the one thing that did come up, come up, uh, was just basically making sure
[8297.76 → 8300.32] there was at a very minimum parody.
[8300.72 → 8303.96] So like YouTube shouldn't get something that flow plane will be better.
[8304.16 → 8304.48] Yeah.
[8304.54 → 8305.66] It's not going to be trade-offs.
[8305.78 → 8308.08] We're going to be very upfront that float plane is better.
[8308.14 → 8312.16] And if you want the best possible engagement with Linus media group and everything that
[8312.16 → 8313.24] we do, that's on float plane.
[8314.18 → 8318.10] Cause like there are certain things that we're just not going to be able to curate on YouTube.
[8318.10 → 8321.66] Like the, the, the community on float plane is just super cool.
[8321.76 → 8322.38] I really love it.
[8322.62 → 8322.82] Yeah.
[8323.48 → 8324.26] Oh, they want to pull.
[8324.40 → 8324.98] That makes sense.
[8324.98 → 8325.20] Yeah.
[8325.30 → 8327.64] We should, we should just been acting a little weird, but I will.
[8327.64 → 8328.16] We'll throw one up.
[8328.22 → 8328.76] We'll see how it goes.
[8328.88 → 8329.58] We'll give it a shot.
[8329.66 → 8330.20] All right, guys.
[8330.32 → 8333.88] But overall, it seems like the perception is, is pretty good.
[8336.92 → 8339.30] You think, are you cool with the YouTube thing is fair enough?
[8339.50 → 8341.26] Oh, people are asking what about shorts?
[8341.36 → 8347.26] So we are, we are looking at, um, I actually talked to the social team about this recently.
[8347.44 → 8354.88] What we're trying to do is use texts and picture posts to put, I don't think we're going
[8354.88 → 8359.22] to do this until we've got the channels' thing fully launched, not beta anymore.
[8359.56 → 8363.88] But once we do, I think we're going to add a social channel and maybe a shorts channel.
[8364.12 → 8367.88] And then you can subscribe to those for notifications if you want, but otherwise we're
[8367.88 → 8368.46] going to turn off.
[8368.52 → 8369.98] Can we turn off notifications by default?
[8369.98 → 8376.26] So, uh, for the I don't know if we can do it for specific levels, but probably.
[8376.58 → 8378.62] Not for specific levels, just for specific channels.
[8378.90 → 8379.64] No, that's okay.
[8379.74 → 8380.48] So that's what I meant.
[8380.58 → 8381.10] Oh, I see.
[8381.28 → 8381.62] Um.
[8381.86 → 8382.14] Okay.
[8382.62 → 8384.64] Well, people can always turn off the notifications.
[8384.84 → 8385.32] That's going to be a lot.
[8385.32 → 8386.42] It will be too much.
[8386.48 → 8386.66] Yeah.
[8386.68 → 8387.64] Like if every stupid tweet.
[8387.64 → 8391.60] So this is why we haven't done it yet is basically on the beta site for float plane right
[8391.60 → 8394.14] now, there's this new sub channels feature.
[8394.14 → 8397.28] So there's like Linus media group, which still needs to be renamed.
[8397.38 → 8398.58] So it's just Linus high tips right now.
[8398.62 → 8403.26] And then all the YouTube channels, we want to add a section for WAN.
[8403.68 → 8406.42] We want to add a section for shorts, all these other types of things.
[8406.54 → 8411.88] But if we start adding in all the shorts and social posts, your phone is just never
[8411.88 → 8412.50] going to stop.
[8412.62 → 8416.26] There are multiple people at the company that it is their whole job to effectively make
[8416.26 → 8418.96] it so that in this scenario, your phone would never stop.
[8419.26 → 8419.84] Yeah, that's true.
[8419.90 → 8423.88] So like, we don't actually necessarily want that to happen unless you're just like, yeah,
[8424.14 → 8424.80] give me everything.
[8424.96 → 8426.28] So that'll be an option.
[8426.50 → 8426.78] Yeah.
[8427.14 → 8428.92] But we need to not do that.
[8428.98 → 8432.14] You need to be able to turn off notifications for channels that you might not be interested
[8432.14 → 8432.32] in.
[8432.50 → 8436.76] Maybe you're just interested in like a Mac address and tech news.
[8437.40 → 8440.44] Well, you should be able to just turn those on and turn everything else off.
[8440.52 → 8442.64] Or maybe you're interested in the opposite of that.
[8442.72 → 8445.78] Then you should be able to turn those off and everything else on, et cetera, et cetera.
[8446.36 → 8446.96] The poll's coming.
[8446.96 → 8447.78] Michael W.
[8447.88 → 8452.52] You should check out Open Sense, ON Sense, and also do that.
[8454.14 → 8456.42] It's a fork of OF Sense that gets updated more frequently.
[8457.70 → 8458.36] All right.
[8459.56 → 8460.28] Want to hit us, Dan?
[8462.36 → 8462.92] Oh, wait.
[8462.98 → 8463.86] We're supposed to do more topics?
[8464.20 → 8464.90] Are there more topics?
[8465.00 → 8465.90] Have you run out of topics?
[8466.02 → 8466.34] I don't know.
[8466.42 → 8470.36] There's New York, new safety standards for lithium batteries after some fires.
[8470.46 → 8472.30] That seems like pretty good.
[8473.12 → 8474.90] E-bikes, scooters, lithium-ion batteries.
[8475.36 → 8478.94] Have to have third party certification for UL fire safety standards.
[8478.94 → 8480.50] Oh, that kind of makes sense.
[8480.58 → 8483.88] You can't just have these like random certifying themselves.
[8485.02 → 8485.42] Cool.
[8485.80 → 8488.56] You still have 15 minutes before I'm going to turn out the lights on you.
[8489.00 → 8489.02] So.
[8489.24 → 8489.50] Okay.
[8489.60 → 8493.64] Why don't we talk about Tesla employees sharing private recordings of users and bystanders,
[8493.72 → 8494.40] including children?
[8494.40 → 8502.20] We touched on this before, but Tesla is now facing a class action suit following an allegation
[8502.20 → 8506.46] by multiple former employees that it was common practice for Tesla employees to internally
[8506.46 → 8510.32] share sensitive videos and images of customers, often for the purpose of mockery.
[8510.64 → 8514.22] Some made memes out of the images and shared them through the internal messaging system.
[8514.56 → 8518.00] And sometimes the sharing was between individuals, other times between small groups.
[8518.00 → 8523.58] Um, but at times the groups contained scores of employees.
[8523.94 → 8530.64] Shared images included car accidents, embarrassing personal moments, nudity and customer pets and
[8530.64 → 8531.18] children.
[8531.42 → 8531.62] Oh yeah.
[8531.62 → 8533.54] Cause like there are internal cameras, right?
[8533.64 → 8535.16] People do things in cars.
[8536.02 → 8542.14] I mean, I never have, but I've definitely never been talked to by the police about it.
[8542.14 → 8554.40] So yeah, if you, if you add one, I thought you were, uh, if you add one of these, uh, there
[8554.40 → 8556.06] could be a video of that, you know?
[8556.32 → 8556.58] Yeah.
[8556.84 → 8559.64] And maybe someone's like, Oh, I recognize this guy and shares it internally.
[8559.64 → 8560.82] Like you don't want that to happen.
[8561.00 → 8561.68] Float plane exclusive.
[8562.46 → 8567.38] One particularly popular 2021 video showed a driver hitting a child on a bike at significant
[8567.38 → 8567.90] speed.
[8568.04 → 8568.66] Hard enough.
[8568.74 → 8569.70] The child went flying.
[8569.70 → 8574.30] Another showed a person being dragged into a car, apparently against their will.
[8575.42 → 8579.68] According to Tesla, its recordings are anonymous and not linked to the user of their vehicle.
[8579.78 → 8583.46] However, several former employees claim that the recordings are linked to location data,
[8583.54 → 8585.08] which could reveal where a user lives.
[8585.48 → 8585.92] Obviously.
[8586.76 → 8591.22] It's unclear how widespread it was, but it's well known enough that several managers pushed
[8591.22 → 8595.12] back on image sharing on general communication challenges as a violation of the company privacy
[8595.12 → 8595.66] policy.
[8595.88 → 8599.62] In some offices, these memes were seen as a way of earning social approval that might
[8599.62 → 8603.58] lead to a promotion as people in leadership roles were apparently particularly prolific
[8603.58 → 8605.08] at sharing these images.
[8605.76 → 8611.42] Well, I don't, I can't think of anyone in Tesla leadership who's like a member and doesn't
[8611.42 → 8614.04] have a lot of regard for just, you know.
[8614.38 → 8614.82] Right.
[8615.02 → 8615.36] Yeah.
[8615.74 → 8616.00] Yep.
[8616.24 → 8616.44] Hmm.
[8616.58 → 8617.00] Yep.
[8617.12 → 8619.26] Well, yeah, that doesn't really check out.
[8619.26 → 8619.66] Yeah.
[8619.66 → 8624.12] Cause like there is, there is a certain amount of like, there's, there are things that can
[8624.12 → 8625.02] be pretty hard to detect.
[8625.02 → 8634.26] If you're a company that deals with, um, like customer data, if two employees in direct messages
[8634.26 → 8639.62] that you can't monitor are Memling about it, it might be pretty hard to detect genuinely.
[8640.40 → 8642.82] But like, this doesn't sound like that.
[8643.32 → 8644.76] It sounds very widespread.
[8644.76 → 8644.92] Right.
[8645.68 → 8649.76] Several employees reported feeling paranoid while driving the company cars, knowing how
[8649.76 → 8653.82] much informational, how much information was available on the other end and how it could
[8653.82 → 8654.44] be used.
[8654.76 → 8654.86] Wow.
[8655.24 → 8656.02] Discussion question.
[8656.12 → 8658.08] How does this kind of culture grow within a company?
[8659.08 → 8660.80] Um, I don't know.
[8660.86 → 8666.26] How do I, how do I put this in a way that is empathetic, but also based in reality?
[8667.76 → 8669.24] People are jerk wads.
[8669.24 → 8669.68] Yeah.
[8670.88 → 8673.56] Not all of them, but enough of them.
[8674.16 → 8681.92] Um, anonymity and, or, uh, a perception that your actions are free from consequences
[8681.92 → 8685.80] definitely breeds a certain kind of behaviour in people.
[8686.06 → 8691.44] There's also a pretty intense amount of like, if they were on the other end of this, they
[8691.44 → 8695.10] might feel really negative about it, but like, oh, I'm doing it.
[8695.10 → 8697.34] So like, I am good.
[8697.44 → 8699.82] Most people believe themselves as good aligned.
[8700.94 → 8703.00] So like, this is fine.
[8703.04 → 8704.00] I'm just making a joke.
[8704.10 → 8705.76] This isn't actually harming anyone, whatever.
[8705.96 → 8706.20] Right.
[8706.96 → 8707.66] They don't know.
[8707.70 → 8708.32] It can't hurt them.
[8708.44 → 8708.98] That type of stuff.
[8712.68 → 8713.04] Yeah.
[8713.22 → 8713.72] New topic.
[8713.80 → 8715.00] I'm kind of done with it, to be honest.
[8715.00 → 8715.96] Not very cool.
[8716.10 → 8716.34] Yeah.
[8716.58 → 8717.04] Agreed.
[8718.16 → 8719.48] Intel teams up with ARM.
[8720.24 → 8725.06] Intel and ARM have announced a multi-generation agreement to optimize.
[8725.20 → 8728.92] Intel's 18A fabrication process for ARM-based chip designs.
[8729.44 → 8733.58] Intel foundry services would not necessarily be producing chips directly for ARM, but they
[8733.58 → 8737.40] would be in a position to more effectively fulfill orders from ARM licensees like Qualcomm
[8737.40 → 8738.42] and MediaTek.
[8738.96 → 8743.42] Intel described the collaboration as a way of enabling a more balanced global supply chain
[8743.42 → 8748.10] for foundry customers working in mobile SOC design on ARM-based CPU cores, which is another
[8748.10 → 8754.22] way of saying that if China actually really does it this time and invades Taiwan, you guys
[8754.22 → 8759.72] are going to need some way to produce chips because I don't think China is going to be
[8759.72 → 8764.94] super cool about shipping chips to the West after the couple of years that they've had
[8764.94 → 8765.32] over there.
[8765.78 → 8772.04] Intel has described plans to produce hybrid chips that combine x86 ARM and RISC-V CPU cores
[8772.04 → 8772.74] in the past.
[8773.32 → 8776.32] We don't know if this is necessarily related to that, but that could be kind of cool.
[8776.32 → 8780.46] And at the same time, Intel has announced that they are selling off their server division
[8780.46 → 8784.98] to Metal, sorry, exiting the server system business.
[8785.08 → 8787.62] I actually didn't know they still did first-party servers.
[8787.92 → 8792.10] And it doesn't surprise me that they're bailing because it's a relatively low margin business.
[8792.22 → 8799.42] I mean, most of the money in that server made by Supermicro or Dell or whatever is going
[8799.42 → 8805.76] to three places, Intel, NVIDIA, or software.
[8806.58 → 8807.02] Yeah.
[8807.20 → 8811.22] I had the same reaction when I read this, and I think some people misinterpreted this
[8811.22 → 8818.02] as like Intel is exiting the server space entirely, not them like making their own servers, because
[8818.02 → 8819.68] I think people didn't even realize that they did that.
[8820.66 → 8822.28] So they like misinterpreted the title.
[8822.44 → 8824.04] Because when I read it, I was like, wait, what?
[8824.82 → 8826.16] Because yeah, I didn't think they did that either.
[8826.16 → 8829.40] I hadn't heard of those in a hot minute.
[8831.90 → 8833.00] And that's it, Dan.
[8833.08 → 8834.90] I think it's time for Wan show After Dark.
[8836.42 → 8839.04] Except he has to go over there to do it, so it's not going to be that pew-y.
[8839.16 → 8839.36] Oh.
[8839.36 → 8840.58] I haven't automated it yet.
[8840.84 → 8842.60] Oh, he's going to automate it, though.
[8842.74 → 8843.42] Oh, my goodness.
[8843.54 → 8845.10] We could totally see you walking across.
[8845.70 → 8848.96] You've become immersed in the LMG way.
[8849.36 → 8855.06] I think Dan, when he started, would have insisted on not walking in front of the camera.
[8855.06 → 8856.80] I was so retentive about it.
[8856.80 → 8857.82] In another six months.
[8857.92 → 8858.66] Yeah, exactly.
[8858.94 → 8860.20] Okay, it didn't take six months.
[8861.82 → 8863.28] Fine, that's how it's going to be.
[8864.08 → 8865.06] Is it dark enough for you?
[8865.12 → 8866.00] All right, hit us.
[8867.06 → 8869.18] Let me sit down first, man.
[8870.30 → 8872.86] Okay, this is from Jesse.
[8873.64 → 8874.04] Hey, Luke.
[8874.56 → 8880.50] Terrifying to think we are living through progress in AI that will form the foundation of our future
[8880.50 → 8882.44] utopia or annihilation.
[8882.44 → 8886.10] How did I know the whole content of the statement when it started with terrifying?
[8886.42 → 8886.60] Yes.
[8886.90 → 8891.12] Any idea how you would explain AI to children or young teens?
[8892.52 → 8892.74] Oh.
[8893.68 → 8895.82] A different direction than I was expecting to.
[8895.92 → 8902.42] The way I've done that so far is to just describe it as a computer assistant.
[8903.26 → 8906.38] An advanced computer assistant that you control by talking to it.
[8906.38 → 8909.06] And honestly, they tend to get it pretty fast.
[8911.76 → 8916.14] I think this is, again, one of those things where, like, we're the old people now.
[8916.22 → 8918.92] So we're probably adjusting to it worse than the kids are.
[8918.92 → 8923.98] I've talked to some, like, startup teams about it.
[8924.98 → 8927.80] And I've seen this idea pushed around by other people as well.
[8927.86 → 8931.00] I don't know if I said it first or not, so I can't say if I stole it.
[8931.00 → 8940.34] But, like, looking at how the young'us use these tools is probably going to be a very interesting thing to do.
[8940.50 → 8947.80] Because a lot of us, like, a lot of what I'm getting out of it is, like, I'm excited for Copilot to come to office.
[8947.94 → 8949.44] That announcement was insane.
[8949.54 → 8950.28] That blew my mind.
[8950.28 → 8959.98] When Copilot comes to office, I'm going to immediately be getting different teams around this office to start using it for beneficial things.
[8960.16 → 8964.78] There are a lot of different ways that people could be more efficient with Copilot directly built into office.
[8967.02 → 8971.02] That's how, like, old boomer me is interpreting it.
[8971.60 → 8974.18] But how are the kids going to use it, right?
[8974.68 → 8975.86] That's an interesting question.
[8976.08 → 8976.90] But, yeah, I don't know.
[8976.90 → 8984.36] I haven't had any young people, and I've talked to a couple of people that are, like, younger than 14.
[8984.52 → 8986.30] I don't know exactly how old they are about it.
[8987.22 → 8988.50] They tend to get it pretty quick.
[8988.94 → 8992.00] It doesn't actually seem super complicated to them, which I find interesting.
[8992.32 → 8993.34] But, yeah, that's it.
[8994.14 → 8995.54] Yeah, it's going to get scary.
[8996.90 → 9000.34] Hey, Linus, which one of your cats would you say is your absolute favourite?
[9000.76 → 9001.04] Oof.
[9001.94 → 9004.26] Ooh, it's got to be my mashie.
[9004.82 → 9005.74] Yep, dash.
[9005.74 → 9007.40] She's the one we've had the longest.
[9009.70 → 9015.44] She's the one that likes me the most or is, like, bonded to me the most.
[9016.10 → 9022.22] She – people who think cats don't have relationships with people, like, they just see them as a food source,
[9022.30 → 9028.76] have just obviously, like, never had a cat or, like, never cared for a cat because they expect reciprocation.
[9028.76 → 9030.84] Their love is not unconditional.
[9030.84 → 9031.14] No.
[9031.54 → 9040.90] Um, so the way that she'll – the way that she'll follow me around and, you know, want snuggles and want to hang out is really sweet.
[9040.90 → 9046.82] She doesn't always want to be held or anything like that, but she is almost always orbiting the family.
[9047.14 → 9049.06] If everyone's upstairs, Dash is upstairs.
[9049.54 → 9052.92] If everyone's in the basement, she might be chilling, like, over there on a chair.
[9052.92 → 9054.64] But she likes to be near everybody.
[9054.64 → 9055.90] She's super social.
[9056.20 → 9058.02] Um, and she's just such a sweetheart.
[9058.54 → 9065.64] Uh, there's more than one of the contractors who worked on our renovation over the last couple of years.
[9065.64 → 9075.44] More than one of them messaged me just, like, pictures of Dash completely unsolicited, just being hilarious or being a sweetheart.
[9076.04 → 9085.98] Um, and more than one Linus Media Group employee who was at my house for some reason or another, unsolicited, messaged me a picture of Dash just being a sweetheart or being hilarious.
[9086.16 → 9087.22] She's just a great cat.
[9089.18 → 9089.62] Okay.
[9089.74 → 9092.40] This one, uh, might be for Luke as well.
[9092.50 → 9093.12] It's from Chris.
[9093.12 → 9099.64] Luke and Linus, with companies now getting their own LLMs, uh, it's hard to say.
[9100.08 → 9107.32] What are your thoughts on companies or governments being able to create an actually effective AI-powered lie detector?
[9109.00 → 9113.40] Um, I don't...
[9113.40 → 9114.16] What do you mean?
[9114.16 → 9116.16] Yeah, I don't know if...
[9117.80 → 9126.14] Any test can be defeated by a suitably armed, um, test taker.
[9126.44 → 9127.12] Also, like...
[9127.12 → 9127.52] I don't know if I...
[9127.52 → 9128.20] I don't know if I just...
[9128.20 → 9129.38] I just don't know if I buy that.
[9129.44 → 9134.48] Using a thing that notoriously lies all the time as a lie detector is kind of hilarious, in my opinion.
[9134.66 → 9134.98] Yeah.
[9135.18 → 9136.36] I think we can move on to the next one.
[9136.60 → 9136.78] Yeah.
[9137.36 → 9137.68] Easy.
[9137.68 → 9140.00] Um, this is from Aaron.
[9140.00 → 9143.44] Recently purchased a gigabyte 4080 Aero OC.
[9143.76 → 9154.10] The HDMI 2.1 connection is last in priority, making a multi-monitor setup impossible to show bias on the HDMI if a DisplayPort is connected.
[9154.78 → 9155.18] Why?
[9156.34 → 9158.28] Oh, this is a rough one.
[9158.28 → 9160.32] Um, I can answer your question.
[9160.54 → 9172.46] It's because DisplayPort 99 times out of 100 is going to be the primary display for a GPU, unless you are only connected via HDMI.
[9172.86 → 9173.58] So that's...
[9173.58 → 9175.56] That's why that's the default behaviour.
[9175.86 → 9183.22] As for why multi-monitor management isn't better in this day and age, I don't rightly know.
[9184.28 → 9187.84] Obviously, this is a pretty niche use case, mine.
[9188.28 → 9192.04] But I was furious recently.
[9192.66 → 9194.16] Like, just...
[9194.16 → 9195.16] Just...
[9195.82 → 9196.24] Ugh.
[9196.80 → 9197.48] Just...
[9197.48 → 9199.30] Just furious recently.
[9199.30 → 9202.32] Because I was trying to do something that felt very simple.
[9202.70 → 9207.56] What I wanted was to manually assign each of my displays.
[9207.76 → 9210.42] So my computer sits in the mechanical room.
[9210.86 → 9214.40] And it runs my desktop display upstairs.
[9214.40 → 9222.28] It runs the system, like, another display over in the LAN room with my kids' machines so that we can play Minecraft Dungeons or whatever.
[9222.66 → 9225.74] And I also wanted to play in the theatre room.
[9226.74 → 9228.96] And I have optical cables going everywhere.
[9229.10 → 9230.40] Like, it all works.
[9230.48 → 9231.98] I can do that.
[9231.98 → 9236.50] But what I wanted was to manually assign the display priority.
[9236.92 → 9237.60] So the number.
[9237.86 → 9240.40] You know how on Windows, it's like, this is display one, this is two, this is three.
[9240.40 → 9242.34] When you click identify, it shows the number in the corner.
[9242.36 → 9242.38] Yeah.
[9242.38 → 9243.48] And there are certain...
[9243.48 → 9245.74] There are certain things that...
[9245.74 → 9250.16] I forget.
[9250.44 → 9252.90] I don't even remember exactly why it mattered.
[9253.12 → 9258.68] But there are certain things that are easier to do if a particular display is display number one.
[9259.04 → 9259.38] Interesting.
[9259.50 → 9260.30] Not just primary?
[9260.48 → 9261.44] It has to be display one?
[9261.58 → 9261.94] That's right.
[9262.00 → 9262.48] I thought it was primary.
[9262.60 → 9262.90] Interesting.
[9263.10 → 9263.24] Yeah.
[9263.24 → 9269.82] And when you set a display as your primary display, that doesn't make it display number one.
[9269.82 → 9270.60] No, it definitely doesn't.
[9270.60 → 9274.58] That just makes it your primary display for all intents and purposes.
[9274.58 → 9276.66] So it was that...
[9276.66 → 9285.44] I think what I wanted to do was I wanted to have it duplicated and then only go to one.
[9285.56 → 9286.94] And then I wanted to be able to like...
[9286.94 → 9291.40] Like, I wanted to make sure that one upstairs was always the first one.
[9291.84 → 9294.88] And the theatre room was always the third one.
[9294.92 → 9296.60] And there was some reason I wanted to do that.
[9296.64 → 9296.96] I'm sorry.
[9297.02 → 9297.72] I just don't...
[9297.72 → 9298.68] I don't remember anymore.
[9299.12 → 9302.60] And what I discovered is that there are some weird hacky workarounds.
[9302.60 → 9309.62] If you do a fresh install, and you plug in the first one first, that like should make it the first one.
[9309.92 → 9309.98] Okay.
[9310.22 → 9313.14] There are also registry keys that maybe you can whatever.
[9313.36 → 9318.64] Some people have had some success with moving the displays around on different ports, but most people reported that didn't work.
[9318.64 → 9324.36] But there is no hard and fast way for you to just tell Windows, actually, f*** off.
[9324.74 → 9325.86] This is display one.
[9326.20 → 9327.82] This is my primary display.
[9328.74 → 9330.30] And this has been a problem.
[9330.64 → 9333.26] I remember at NCI, I had four monitors.
[9334.28 → 9341.14] And what I did at that time is I got frustrated at some point and I just physically moved them.
[9341.14 → 9347.32] Because, you know, every time a display driver reset happened or whatever, I didn't want them mixed up.
[9347.36 → 9348.10] I didn't want to deal with that.
[9348.14 → 9349.74] I just wanted them to be detected correctly.
[9350.70 → 9353.22] You cannot do that.
[9355.54 → 9356.40] That's pretty frustrating.
[9356.58 → 9358.04] It is infuriating.
[9358.16 → 9362.98] And obviously there's, you know, people helpfully reply to users saying, well, Linux, you can do this.
[9363.06 → 9365.74] Like that's nice, but I'm not running Linux.
[9365.74 → 9365.78] Thanks.
[9365.84 → 9366.24] Thank you.
[9368.42 → 9368.82] Yeah.
[9368.90 → 9377.32] So if anyone from Microsoft is watching, please, please just let me assign my display priority.
[9379.26 → 9380.22] That would be great.
[9380.82 → 9381.44] Thank you.
[9381.86 → 9384.34] I really wish I remembered why it was so infuriating.
[9384.66 → 9387.34] I was trying to do, I was trying to do something.
[9387.46 → 9389.36] Like I wanted all three of them running.
[9389.56 → 9393.04] And then when, when one would kick in, it would like boot off the other one.
[9393.12 → 9393.58] I don't know.
[9393.68 → 9394.48] I can't remember anymore.
[9394.48 → 9394.88] Sorry.
[9395.74 → 9396.30] Okay, Dan.
[9397.40 → 9397.66] Okay.
[9397.74 → 9398.48] This is from Ian.
[9399.08 → 9410.54] Linus, with AI having the ability to be trained on anything, do you believe at some point we will see an AI antivirus or the need for an anti-AI virus to stop AI actions?
[9410.76 → 9413.70] AI versus anti-AI AI.
[9414.04 → 9415.06] Totally already a thing.
[9415.06 → 9416.86] Yeah.
[9416.86 → 9416.88] Yeah.
[9416.88 → 9427.16] Like machine learning enabled anti-malware will look for certain patterns of behaviour in programs, and it will flag them even if they aren't a known threat.
[9427.90 → 9428.46] Yep.
[9428.46 → 9429.86] Okay.
[9429.86 → 9430.86] Got another one here.
[9431.32 → 9433.26] The year is 2073.
[9434.04 → 9441.08] Grandpa Linus steps in front of the camera one last time to record his final Linus Tech Tips video before finally retiring.
[9441.38 → 9443.30] What would say video be about?
[9443.30 → 9445.04] You retired pretty old.
[9445.70 → 9445.96] Yeah.
[9446.04 → 9446.28] Wow.
[9446.34 → 9447.36] I made it really far.
[9447.82 → 9447.96] I know.
[9448.02 → 9450.46] I'm pretty sure that this job would kill me long before then.
[9453.76 → 9454.44] What would it be?
[9454.44 → 9457.84] I mean, I think it would just be like a big, you know, thank you to everyone.
[9458.20 → 9459.12] I, man.
[9459.70 → 9460.10] Okay.
[9460.16 → 9462.26] If it has to be about an actual product.
[9464.08 → 9473.98] Oh, I'd kind of love for it to be some like kind of grand project, you know, like a whole room water cooling or like a scrapyard wars.
[9474.14 → 9476.98] But I think more realistically, it would probably be a troll.
[9476.98 → 9484.60] Like it'd probably be a fake review of a product that's not real, but we like did some movie magic and made it seem real or something like that.
[9484.60 → 9488.32] I could see going out with like a mystery.
[9489.20 → 9491.36] You know, how did he have that?
[9491.48 → 9492.84] How did he get that working?
[9493.04 → 9496.72] You know, like, yeah, I could see just like being a complete member about it.
[9497.54 → 9499.56] But I still have a sense of humour when I'm that old.
[9499.60 → 9500.10] I hope so.
[9501.54 → 9502.88] I think you'll still be a troll.
[9505.14 → 9506.52] Just improves with age.
[9507.80 → 9508.24] Okay.
[9508.38 → 9509.66] Next up's from Mason.
[9510.34 → 9512.48] Hello, Dan and the talent.
[9514.56 → 9515.18] Thank you.
[9515.26 → 9515.96] I feel so vindicated.
[9515.98 → 9516.50] What about Luke?
[9517.12 → 9519.76] Oh, hey, got him.
[9520.00 → 9520.52] Good one.
[9520.62 → 9520.82] Yeah.
[9521.52 → 9522.72] I collect CRTs.
[9523.02 → 9527.56] I have 12 now and cannot explain how I justify keeping all of them.
[9527.56 → 9533.02] Is there any now antiquated technology that you don't think you could ever get rid of?
[9536.98 → 9540.58] Man, these are like really tough questions.
[9541.90 → 9544.28] Antiquated technology I don't think I could get rid of.
[9545.06 → 9550.14] I mean, a phone, a watch seems pretty superfluous these days, but I just, I don't know.
[9550.14 → 9551.50] I kind of just like wearing them.
[9551.58 → 9553.04] This doesn't even have the right time on it.
[9554.06 → 9557.10] This is that Pebble, that Pebble time that Shank Mods gave me.
[9557.12 → 9559.84] I'm wearing it so that I remember to figure out Rebel.
[9560.24 → 9565.38] It's like this weird side load old Pebble apps something thing.
[9565.44 → 9567.18] Apparently you could like still get these things working.
[9567.28 → 9568.48] I just haven't gotten around to it.
[9568.62 → 9572.12] I dedicated about three minutes to it and was like, oh, okay, this is more than a three
[9572.12 → 9572.64] minute project.
[9572.64 → 9573.88] And then I gave up temporarily.
[9573.88 → 9575.48] So this is to like to remind me to do it.
[9577.32 → 9580.52] Antiquated tech that you can't bring yourself to get rid of.
[9580.60 → 9582.98] I mean, Luke doesn't buy anything, so he doesn't have anything.
[9583.40 → 9584.92] There's some retro console stuff.
[9585.58 → 9585.78] Yeah.
[9585.86 → 9586.06] Okay.
[9586.16 → 9587.34] I'd have a hard time getting rid of.
[9588.72 → 9590.54] You could, if you needed to though, just emulate.
[9590.54 → 9595.32] But I absolutely could and have seriously thought about it and just don't have to right now.
[9595.38 → 9596.36] Which is the only reason why I haven't.
[9597.02 → 9601.80] But like, if I needed money, I would flip my retro consoles immediately.
[9602.04 → 9602.98] That'd be the first thing to go.
[9604.92 → 9605.56] I don't know.
[9605.76 → 9606.80] So, yeah, not really.
[9607.02 → 9607.46] I don't know.
[9609.36 → 9613.10] Next up, when show with guests as the olden days.
[9613.42 → 9613.70] When?
[9614.96 → 9616.38] Guests take a long time.
[9616.70 → 9620.40] I love bringing guests on, but how do I say this tactfully?
[9620.76 → 9625.04] Generally speaking, the guest segments don't perform as well as when it's just me and Luke
[9625.04 → 9626.48] and I guess that guy.
[9627.82 → 9634.08] So there's no audience drive to make that happen.
[9634.42 → 9635.48] Speaking broadly.
[9636.66 → 9640.10] And it makes the show take even longer, which is already a problem we have.
[9640.88 → 9644.58] So we're not solving any problems, and we're creating new ones.
[9644.58 → 9648.68] It's a good thing to have in the back pocket for when it like totally makes sense by either
[9648.68 → 9655.88] us very specifically wanting to add promotion to a thing or a person for a very specific
[9655.88 → 9659.16] reason or because like we need help with a topic.
[9659.74 → 9661.60] If there's like, hey, you did this thing.
[9661.74 → 9662.98] We want to talk to you about it.
[9663.54 → 9663.98] Maybe.
[9665.02 → 9666.38] But also maybe not.
[9666.58 → 9670.98] Because it might be better to just talk to you about it offline and then cover the notes.
[9670.98 → 9674.32] Got another one here.
[9674.94 → 9677.54] Would you ever make a hand warmer for typing?
[9677.84 → 9683.82] My hands freeze in office and a small heated desk pad or infrared heater would be amazing.
[9684.24 → 9690.16] Also, any logistics tips for a prospective badminton gym owner?
[9690.72 → 9691.46] Don't do it.
[9691.52 → 9692.70] It's not a profitable business.
[9692.88 → 9695.08] I'm only getting into it because I intend to lose money.
[9695.08 → 9699.10] Oh, mind you, real estate might not be as expensive where you are.
[9699.24 → 9699.44] Okay.
[9699.58 → 9700.56] You know, good luck.
[9701.16 → 9703.86] In that case, here it's super dumb.
[9705.20 → 9706.90] As for the hand warmer.
[9707.14 → 9709.68] That's the opposite direction that I'm used to hearing that go.
[9710.82 → 9713.92] I'm used to people getting like little fans and stuff, not warmer.
[9713.92 → 9714.20] Yeah.
[9714.36 → 9715.60] You're a warm boy though.
[9715.70 → 9719.72] Like I guarantee you, Yvonne would benefit from like a desktop hand warmer.
[9719.72 → 9723.32] I'd be afraid to ship anything that's designed to generate heat.
[9723.32 → 9723.76] Yeah.
[9723.90 → 9725.52] I'd just be worried about liability.
[9725.72 → 9726.96] And like melting stuff.
[9727.08 → 9727.34] Yeah.
[9728.42 → 9730.82] Like someone touching it and burning themselves or something.
[9730.82 → 9733.38] The general move is to put a cage in front of it that limits.
[9733.86 → 9734.32] Yeah.
[9734.40 → 9736.72] But now this is becoming very cumbersome.
[9736.88 → 9738.48] So you've got a heating element, wiring.
[9738.76 → 9739.62] You've got a cage.
[9740.68 → 9742.30] Um, hmm.
[9744.02 → 9745.18] I don't know.
[9745.44 → 9745.60] Okay.
[9745.72 → 9751.16] I think you could do a wrist rest actually by using that same like wire that they use in
[9751.16 → 9751.84] heating blankets.
[9752.10 → 9752.54] Yeah.
[9752.54 → 9753.44] Um.
[9755.48 → 9755.92] Yeah.
[9755.92 → 9757.64] The wrist rest could be doable.
[9761.22 → 9762.46] There's definitely options.
[9762.80 → 9764.30] You could do gloves as well.
[9764.38 → 9768.32] But like, I hate wearing gloves when I'm typing or using a mouse.
[9768.72 → 9769.12] Yeah.
[9769.38 → 9769.78] That's tough.
[9769.78 → 9772.60] Like gamer gloves were a thing for a very small period of time.
[9772.76 → 9776.40] I think we even bought a bunch of gamer gloves with the intention of doing a roundup.
[9776.46 → 9777.36] What the heck happened to that?
[9778.76 → 9779.36] Dang it.
[9779.36 → 9780.18] I don't know.
[9780.26 → 9783.14] But the number of videos that were like, oh yeah, we should totally do that.
[9783.20 → 9784.24] And we just never do.
[9784.38 → 9784.92] It's wild.
[9785.34 → 9785.50] Yeah.
[9787.22 → 9788.78] One of the problems is like power delivery.
[9788.78 → 9790.74] If it's gloves or something like that.
[9791.22 → 9791.64] Mm-hmm.
[9792.20 → 9793.12] That gets weird.
[9793.96 → 9794.30] Um.
[9795.16 → 9797.84] I mean, people wear giant helmets.
[9798.66 → 9799.46] So like.
[9800.66 → 9801.16] Yeah.
[9801.16 → 9802.44] You never know what nerds will wear.
[9802.68 → 9802.82] What?
[9803.16 → 9804.00] Wait, giant?
[9804.10 → 9804.90] You mean VR?
[9805.04 → 9805.26] Yeah.
[9805.26 → 9805.70] Okay.
[9806.10 → 9807.72] I was like, what is this reference?
[9807.72 → 9808.62] No, I mean Daft Punk.
[9811.28 → 9812.10] Oh man.
[9812.28 → 9812.86] That's funny.
[9814.30 → 9815.10] No promises.
[9815.80 → 9815.94] Yeah.
[9815.94 → 9816.38] Yeah.
[9817.66 → 9820.84] What's the progress update on the stubby screwdriver?
[9821.18 → 9825.16] Is something different compared to the full-size screwdriver in development?
[9825.50 → 9828.12] I would really love to hear more about it since we saw it last.
[9828.50 → 9829.56] It's just small.
[9829.78 → 9834.18] And it's still mostly on track, it looks like, for LTX launch.
[9834.18 → 9836.76] It's exciting.
[9836.90 → 9837.44] I'm excited.
[9838.60 → 9842.14] To Linus and Luke, but mostly Luke, another AI question.
[9842.86 → 9848.12] What are your thoughts on chat GPT-4 being used for sports betting, stock trading, and
[9848.12 → 9849.78] crypto trading or prediction?
[9850.22 → 9850.80] Love the show.
[9851.48 → 9853.44] Shout out from South Louisiana.
[9854.16 → 9855.60] I think the A got cut off.
[9855.80 → 9856.86] We all knew it was going to happen.
[9856.94 → 9858.88] We kind of talked about it earlier in the show.
[9859.24 → 9860.34] Use it at your own risk.
[9860.56 → 9861.56] I don't know what to tell you.
[9861.92 → 9863.68] I don't give financial advice.
[9864.18 → 9865.42] Sounds scary, though.
[9866.32 → 9871.50] Using a language predictor to predict the results of a horse race?
[9871.62 → 9871.96] Like, really?
[9873.30 → 9876.48] I mean, the horses have names in language.
[9876.90 → 9877.18] Yeah.
[9877.58 → 9878.18] Okay.
[9878.34 → 9878.82] We can take that.
[9878.82 → 9886.60] I think just deciding that it is a catch-all solution for all AI or ML tasks is a little weird.
[9886.60 → 9889.72] But, yeah.
[9890.20 → 9891.00] Use it at your own risk.
[9891.10 → 9891.42] I don't know.
[9892.56 → 9892.74] Okay.
[9892.86 → 9895.92] As a new subscriber, I have a question regarding Float plane.
[9896.30 → 9899.50] Have the goals for the platform changed since the initial inception?
[9899.76 → 9901.98] And what are the goals for Float plane currently?
[9901.98 → 9904.12] The core goal has never changed.
[9904.46 → 9906.34] The core goal is based around the name.
[9906.70 → 9906.94] Yeah.
[9907.60 → 9911.94] The name Float plane was spawned from Nikita.
[9913.00 → 9918.38] And it comes from it might not take off, but it will never sink kind of idea.
[9918.38 → 9926.18] That core concept applies to how we do, like, development and technological choices for the platform.
[9926.40 → 9929.06] So it makes things a lot harder.
[9929.24 → 9934.66] It makes things a lot more complicated, to be honest, because there's much easier ways of doing things.
[9934.66 → 9941.52] But when we build something, we always build it so that it's, like, it can run on any platform.
[9941.66 → 9942.60] It can run with any service.
[9942.60 → 9946.46] So, like, we might use some service for some specific thing.
[9947.24 → 9954.20] But I can guarantee you that that is portable to something else with little effort for, like, everything that we do.
[9955.74 → 9961.04] And it would be easier because the industry is absolutely built for buy-in.
[9961.04 → 9965.38] A lot of these big companies want you to – I don't remember what it's called.
[9966.52 → 9968.48] Normally, I would be able to remember, but I don't remember right now.
[9968.78 → 9970.10] There's a term for it.
[9970.34 → 9971.46] Is it just lock-in?
[9972.30 → 9975.54] There's a term for it when you start working with one company.
[9976.00 → 9987.84] And then by working with them more and more and more and more, it would become extremely painful for you to switch to another company because all your stuff is built specifically for their platform.
[9988.16 → 9989.64] CRMs are brutal for that.
[9990.22 → 9990.48] Yeah.
[9990.48 → 9991.42] Oh, my God.
[9991.50 → 9991.66] Yeah.
[9991.86 → 9993.40] Tons of different things are brutal for that.
[9993.50 → 9994.26] They want that.
[9994.42 → 9995.86] And even if – it's not sunk cost.
[9995.92 → 9996.50] No, vendor lock.
[9996.58 → 9997.22] Yeah, vendor lock.
[9998.10 → 10005.20] Even if they advertise, like, oh, it's not like that, usually the path of least resistance is to do that anyway.
[10006.28 → 10013.84] So, we often go down the path of definitely not the least resistance, which is rough.
[10014.06 → 10016.52] But, I mean, we're still here.
[10017.38 → 10018.46] We're still floating.
[10018.64 → 10019.40] We're still okay.
[10019.40 → 10020.40] Still kicking.
[10020.40 → 10022.56] And that's kind of the main goal.
[10022.56 → 10026.08] There's obviously other goals in regard to, like, features and whatever else.
[10026.08 → 10030.94] But those are, like, the things that we do to make the platform worth using for people.
[10031.12 → 10033.80] But the main goal is to make sure that the platform will always be here.
[10034.50 → 10035.04] What's up?
[10035.40 → 10035.96] He's on it.
[10035.96 → 10036.48] I got it.
[10036.48 → 10037.30] I'm doing it now.
[10037.62 → 10040.70] We didn't announce the new product we launched on the store.
[10040.96 → 10041.64] What did we launch?
[10042.04 → 10042.80] Oh, oh, yeah.
[10044.24 → 10045.12] New desk pad.
[10045.30 → 10045.56] Hey.
[10046.06 → 10046.82] Looks sick.
[10047.32 → 10048.30] It does, actually.
[10048.70 → 10049.64] What the heck just happened?
[10050.98 → 10051.28] Oof.
[10051.70 → 10051.96] Book.
[10052.18 → 10052.68] We're back.
[10052.78 → 10053.42] New desk pad.
[10053.88 → 10054.68] I like the design.
[10054.68 → 10055.82] It's sick.
[10056.00 → 10060.06] It's actually inspired by the sign in the lounge.
[10061.12 → 10061.64] Oh, yeah.
[10061.80 → 10062.38] That makes sense.
[10062.46 → 10062.58] Yeah.
[10062.66 → 10066.16] So it's kind of a Janus design, if you really think about it.
[10066.28 → 10066.36] Yeah.
[10066.36 → 10073.00] I think that the one who actually brought it to life here was Lloyd.
[10073.14 → 10077.42] And there might have been some collaboration from Sarah or another designer.
[10079.78 → 10086.02] Because, you know, it started on a wall and had to make its way into, you know, A, a design for a mouse pad.
[10086.02 → 10087.62] And B, a bunch of different sizes.
[10087.62 → 10094.32] Because this is yet another one of our $29.99, no matter what size you choose.
[10094.32 → 10095.14] Oh, my goodness.
[10095.14 → 10097.68] The amount of SKUs.
[10098.24 → 10098.66] But, yeah.
[10098.84 → 10104.18] It's a less stealthy, but still pretty darn stealthy design.
[10104.58 → 10106.00] We did brand this one.
[10106.32 → 10112.14] So it has a big, fat LTT in the middle for your convenience, right where your keyboard will be.
[10112.50 → 10116.46] We wanted the keyboard to feel like the centre of this design.
[10116.46 → 10123.22] So you can see that even though the logo is dead centre, the way that the line work comes in.
[10123.22 → 10125.28] That's actually pretty cool.
[10125.28 → 10125.86] I like that.
[10125.86 → 10133.72] It really works well with the keyboard being the kind of origin of all the traces here in the circuit.
[10133.94 → 10134.32] Yeah, that's smart.
[10134.86 → 10135.04] Yeah.
[10135.26 → 10136.78] So it's a super...
[10136.78 → 10140.60] It's the little thoughtful stuff like that that does happen.
[10140.60 → 10144.76] These conversations do take place as part of the product development process.
[10145.22 → 10151.06] But it's not often easy to communicate to you all.
[10151.06 → 10154.36] Yeah.
[10154.48 → 10156.80] Same great 3.5mm base.
[10157.18 → 10159.66] Same great antifray stitching around the edge.
[10159.78 → 10162.10] Same great top surface weave.
[10162.10 → 10171.28] I know you guys will love it because our desk pad has been a modest success to say the least.
[10172.98 → 10174.52] Like what?
[10174.72 → 10175.64] That's a lot of reviews.
[10175.80 → 10177.62] That is five stars.
[10177.76 → 10178.84] These are not curated.
[10179.02 → 10180.08] These are not filtered.
[10180.30 → 10183.82] These are just people flipping love this thing.
[10183.82 → 10191.32] I pretty much promise you that most of this stuff is just people who never got their order.
[10192.86 → 10193.80] Shipping complications.
[10194.10 → 10195.34] Yeah, and messaged support.
[10195.52 → 10196.96] And we took a long time to get back to them.
[10197.06 → 10199.22] And then they just never updated their review.
[10199.40 → 10200.46] But we do get back to everyone.
[10200.58 → 10202.62] It just does take some time sometimes.
[10202.72 → 10203.84] And there's nothing we can do about that stuff.
[10203.86 → 10204.64] We don't remove it.
[10205.10 → 10205.80] We leave it there.
[10205.96 → 10208.04] That's on us.
[10208.20 → 10209.46] We got to do better.
[10209.46 → 10212.96] But, you know, we can't prevent couriers from taking a long time sometimes.
[10213.48 → 10214.28] Shippings get lost.
[10214.38 → 10215.00] Stuff happens.
[10215.52 → 10217.70] What we can do is reply to people in a timely manner.
[10217.76 → 10220.94] And I've seen perfect feedback about our customer service lately.
[10221.04 → 10227.84] In fact, we managed to blow up on the Subreddit for doing something good for a change, which was really nice recently.
[10228.06 → 10234.52] We reached out proactively about the thing with the tech sack where the image on the site didn't match what people actually got.
[10234.52 → 10245.38] But so what we decided to do, even though it's a functionally equivalent product, and it's better, actually, we offered everyone a $10 credit for just being chill.
[10245.52 → 10249.42] Or if they didn't like that, then we offered just a full refund in return.
[10249.62 → 10250.54] Like, well, hey, we'll take it back.
[10250.58 → 10251.00] No problem.
[10251.16 → 10253.40] So people were pretty happy with that.
[10253.62 → 10253.84] Cool.
[10253.84 → 10258.30] It's the kind of thing that we would do even if we didn't have to because we don't have to.
[10258.42 → 10261.94] But we do it anyway because, you know, trust me, bro.
[10262.24 → 10262.74] Got you.
[10264.52 → 10266.40] Not the message?
[10267.28 → 10267.82] Hit me.
[10268.40 → 10268.66] Okay.
[10269.14 → 10270.14] Hey, LLD.
[10270.62 → 10273.84] Most companies focus around how to automate tasks.
[10274.32 → 10284.08] Are there functions in work or lifestyle that you all will purposely take the harder or more expensive route to preserve human skill and jobs?
[10284.68 → 10284.98] Uh-oh.
[10285.12 → 10287.18] I was typing response and didn't hear the whole thing.
[10289.02 → 10290.96] With automation becoming...
[10290.96 → 10292.72] Most people would prioritize automation.
[10292.72 → 10300.94] Are there areas where you would do it the hard way on purpose in order to preserve human skill and jobs?
[10301.48 → 10302.92] I think there are a lot of examples.
[10303.12 → 10304.20] Oh, and jobs?
[10304.36 → 10304.72] I don't know.
[10304.80 → 10314.52] There are a lot of examples of areas where people do it the hard way on purpose because people value the effort and skill and craftsmanship involved.
[10314.52 → 10315.92] I don't think the art was the point.
[10315.92 → 10318.12] I think productivity was the point here.
[10318.40 → 10321.24] And if that's the case, honestly, for me, not really.
[10321.64 → 10323.16] I don't think that's true for almost anyone.
[10324.42 → 10326.62] That's not how people work.
[10326.68 → 10331.26] Well, that's how, like, as a society, we kind of create our rules, though.
[10331.26 → 10340.42] Like, the number of times that we will regulate something in order to preserve jobs, it's wild to me.
[10341.62 → 10342.48] Do you have an example?
[10342.56 → 10343.84] Like, imagine if we...
[10343.84 → 10344.44] Okay.
[10345.02 → 10345.76] Hold on.
[10346.96 → 10347.38] Okay.
[10347.52 → 10347.80] Sure.
[10347.90 → 10348.56] Here's an example.
[10348.98 → 10356.24] Did you know that in Richmond, gas stations have to be full service in order to preserve gas pumping jobs?
[10356.24 → 10357.30] I think that's...
[10357.30 → 10357.58] Okay.
[10357.70 → 10359.30] So that is something that I've heard of before.
[10359.44 → 10363.46] I think that is usually laughed at and is uncommon, but does happen.
[10364.58 → 10366.62] Roughly sort of speckled all over the place.
[10366.80 → 10368.08] Chat, feel free to...
[10368.08 → 10368.28] Okay.
[10368.36 → 10371.08] Apparently, there are a couple of states that have that exact same...
[10371.08 → 10371.24] Yeah, no.
[10371.38 → 10373.20] It's speckled all over the place.
[10373.28 → 10373.96] I meant that genuinely.
[10374.08 → 10375.40] I know it happens in a couple states.
[10375.68 → 10379.96] I know it happens in as few spots around Canada, but it's definitely uncommon.
[10380.66 → 10381.42] I mean...
[10381.42 → 10382.46] It is not the norm.
[10382.58 → 10383.24] I should say it that way.
[10383.24 → 10386.32] The way that the car dealership industry has been preserved in general.
[10387.26 → 10388.24] That's just wild.
[10388.34 → 10388.78] That's lobbying.
[10389.22 → 10389.62] Yeah.
[10389.90 → 10392.02] But preserve our jobs.
[10393.70 → 10397.20] Lobbying is pretty much job preservation, if you really boil it down.
[10397.40 → 10397.66] I think...
[10397.66 → 10399.02] Oh, wow.
[10399.16 → 10400.74] I don't agree with that in the slightest.
[10401.06 → 10402.02] I mean...
[10402.02 → 10402.46] Okay.
[10403.26 → 10405.58] It's economic abuse to a huge degree.
[10405.78 → 10406.12] Well, okay.
[10406.24 → 10406.98] No, no, no, no.
[10407.06 → 10407.32] Okay.
[10407.38 → 10408.60] I didn't say it wasn't abuse.
[10408.88 → 10411.54] You specifically said, it is this if you boil it down.
[10411.62 → 10411.82] Yeah.
[10412.30 → 10412.74] Ah.
[10412.74 → 10413.10] Yeah.
[10413.18 → 10415.80] It's self-interested job preservation, then.
[10415.82 → 10416.26] How about that?
[10416.36 → 10417.26] I don't know if...
[10417.26 → 10423.92] If someone's like, I want to make $40 million this year instead of $29 million this year,
[10424.02 → 10426.66] I don't know if saying that is job preservation.
[10426.82 → 10427.54] I don't know if that's fair.
[10428.18 → 10432.14] I don't think the average interest of lobbying is like, I want to make sure I can protect my
[10432.14 → 10433.40] huge swath of employees.
[10433.64 → 10434.32] Well, right.
[10434.32 → 10439.22] But unless you can keep your industry going strong, which...
[10439.22 → 10439.36] Okay.
[10439.46 → 10440.02] So...
[10440.02 → 10440.42] Okay.
[10440.50 → 10441.82] I see where you're going with this.
[10442.60 → 10443.92] I think it's usually...
[10443.92 → 10445.70] It masquerades as job preservation, then.
[10446.34 → 10446.66] Hmm.
[10447.10 → 10449.62] I mean, that's the argument that they'll make often.
[10449.88 → 10450.16] Sure.
[10450.44 → 10451.40] They just lie a lot.
[10452.12 → 10452.36] Yeah.
[10452.80 → 10453.14] Sure.
[10453.14 → 10456.36] So profit preservation says Float plane Chat.
[10456.48 → 10456.58] Sure.
[10456.78 → 10462.68] Profit preservation for a very small amount of people that are extremely beyond like delta
[10462.68 → 10463.74] above survival.
[10463.74 → 10466.54] Well, okay.
[10466.68 → 10470.62] I mean, it also does impact other people down the chain.
[10470.98 → 10471.16] Sure.
[10473.02 → 10473.64] Like it's...
[10473.64 → 10474.52] Not necessarily positively.
[10475.66 → 10478.16] If your boss makes...
[10478.16 → 10482.74] Like, to use the example I just made, if your boss makes $40 million instead of $29 million,
[10482.92 → 10486.30] there is zero guarantee that that benefits you in any way whatsoever.
[10486.30 → 10491.96] Yeah, but your boss won't make any million if your industry is, you know, if your industry
[10491.96 → 10496.74] goes the way of the ice harvesting industry, then the ice harvesting boss...
[10496.74 → 10500.16] I don't think all lobbying is that type of preservation, though.
[10501.02 → 10501.74] Um...
[10501.74 → 10503.90] Okay.
[10504.04 → 10506.14] Well, I mean, I'm open to an example.
[10506.88 → 10508.94] I don't pay that much attention to lobbying.
[10508.94 → 10515.94] A significant amount of it is being able to keep profits high by not following different
[10515.94 → 10517.50] ethical standards, whatever.
[10517.86 → 10522.60] That isn't necessarily resisting your entire industry from disappearing.
[10522.88 → 10524.40] That's keeping profits high.
[10524.94 → 10525.16] Yeah.
[10525.28 → 10525.70] I don't know.
[10525.80 → 10526.22] I guess...
[10526.22 → 10527.06] Man, I'm just...
[10527.06 → 10532.28] I'm thinking like, okay, another great example of lobbying, you know, keeping your industry
[10532.28 → 10536.90] from disappearing would be something like QuickBooks, like personal tax software.
[10536.90 → 10539.90] Like, that's a fascinating rabbit hole.
[10540.12 → 10541.28] There's some really intense lobbying.
[10541.34 → 10546.18] If not for lobbying, that industry simply wouldn't need to exist.
[10546.22 → 10546.74] It shouldn't.
[10546.82 → 10550.40] And everyone who works in it, from all the way to the top, all the way down to the bottom,
[10550.48 → 10550.58] yes, the bottom...
[10550.58 → 10551.90] Could do something better for the world.
[10551.94 → 10552.52] ...would just be gone.
[10552.62 → 10554.14] And yeah, could do something more useful.
[10554.50 → 10555.84] So, like I'm...
[10555.84 → 10557.96] Let's all hope they die faster than they currently are.
[10558.46 → 10558.80] Yeah.
[10558.80 → 10558.90] Yeah.
[10563.18 → 10564.28] Yeah, this is great.
[10564.36 → 10564.96] Float plane chat.
[10565.10 → 10565.62] Cold take.
[10565.94 → 10566.68] F***ING lobbying.
[10566.90 → 10567.52] Yeah, pretty much.
[10568.72 → 10570.12] I mean, there is...
[10570.12 → 10574.90] I am sure there are examples of good lobbying.
[10575.26 → 10577.96] I never said it was good, to be very clear.
[10577.98 → 10578.46] No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10578.56 → 10578.76] Yeah.
[10578.98 → 10581.12] I'm sure there are good examples of it, though.
[10581.36 → 10587.82] It's just a system that is clearly, the vast majority of the time, abused for hyper, bad, negative things.
[10589.16 → 10590.60] No disagreement there.
[10590.76 → 10590.96] Yeah.
[10592.96 → 10594.06] What was the question?
[10594.06 → 10596.68] Oh, right.
[10598.20 → 10599.34] Oh, yeah.
[10599.48 → 10602.58] Is there anything that we would do the inefficient way on purpose?
[10602.58 → 10606.36] What would you do the hard way, just to preserve the art of it, almost?
[10606.52 → 10606.82] Nothing.
[10606.82 → 10609.92] I mean, I guess I do some stuff the hard way.
[10610.38 → 10611.64] Like, I don't know.
[10611.80 → 10612.08] We...
[10612.08 → 10612.34] Well, no.
[10612.44 → 10612.60] Okay.
[10612.66 → 10614.02] You just said to preserve the art of it.
[10614.02 → 10614.80] Yeah, but it's not the art.
[10614.92 → 10616.68] It's for practical purposes.
[10616.88 → 10617.10] Yeah.
[10617.14 → 10622.54] I don't think I would ever not use a dolly just so that I could, like, work out my arms more.
[10623.38 → 10623.60] Yeah.
[10623.60 → 10625.78] Well, no, because then there's, like, a health benefit.
[10626.18 → 10626.34] Yeah.
[10626.52 → 10627.32] Okay, I would do that.
[10627.54 → 10628.98] I would take the stairs if there's an elevator.
[10628.98 → 10631.22] There are examples, though, that fit this.
[10631.32 → 10631.54] Yeah.
[10631.66 → 10633.50] Not if efficiency was a factor.
[10633.78 → 10633.92] There.
[10635.18 → 10635.42] Okay.
[10636.72 → 10637.34] All right.
[10637.46 → 10638.72] Let's get you another one here.
[10638.72 → 10647.40] Linus, YouTube suggested a WAN show from 2013 where you wore a seemingly authentic CAD
[10647.40 → 10651.26] Pat parka issued in the Canadian Armed Forces.
[10651.78 → 10654.38] Wondering how you got one and if you kept it, allegedly.
[10654.64 → 10655.24] Isn't it gone?
[10655.76 → 10656.16] Yeah.
[10656.22 → 10657.34] I don't know what happened to it.
[10657.42 → 10657.96] Yeah, that sucks.
[10657.96 → 10663.04] It's one of those things where it's like that stupid Apple At mark Pippin console.
[10663.18 → 10663.92] Yeah, where the heck is that?
[10663.96 → 10664.64] I don't know.
[10665.02 → 10666.08] It is gone.
[10666.08 → 10666.76] It's just...
[10666.76 → 10667.62] It disappeared.
[10667.62 → 10669.74] It disappeared.
[10669.84 → 10671.66] I have no idea what happened to it.
[10671.72 → 10672.42] My mom gave it to me.
[10672.48 → 10672.92] It was a gift.
[10673.44 → 10677.70] That jacket kept an actually very high number of people warm.
[10678.38 → 10678.82] Yeah.
[10679.32 → 10680.56] It was a helpful jacket.
[10680.72 → 10681.72] It was super warm.
[10682.18 → 10686.40] When we were in, like, hyper startup mode working out of his garage, we didn't necessarily have
[10686.40 → 10692.16] a lot of heating and in winter months that jacket would be, like, passed around because
[10692.16 → 10693.06] it was really warm.
[10694.66 → 10695.42] Oh, man.
[10696.28 → 10696.68] Okay.
[10696.68 → 10698.74] Last one I've got here curated.
[10699.66 → 10704.74] Why has an AMD released any new GPUs since the 7900 series in December?
[10705.10 → 10707.84] Why hold off releasing the mid-range cards?
[10708.38 → 10713.72] Leaks seem to say next launch is June when NVIDIA's 4070 is out now.
[10713.84 → 10715.86] 4060 is coming in May.
[10715.86 → 10719.38] Because it's really, really hard.
[10719.88 → 10726.92] Just because the architecture is, you know, done and out there and on the market doesn't
[10726.92 → 10731.50] mean that those mid-tier chips are fully bug tested, right?
[10731.60 → 10734.00] Like, man, modern microprocessors.
[10734.00 → 10739.80] There's, again, back to that hot take earlier that consumer PC hardware is cheap.
[10740.78 → 10742.10] They're a miracle.
[10742.42 → 10744.14] They are actually an engineering marvel.
[10744.30 → 10744.88] They're magic.
[10746.84 → 10747.32] Basically.
[10747.84 → 10748.22] Right?
[10748.22 → 10753.16] The fact that the 7900 series exists at all amazes me.
[10753.56 → 10754.26] Never mind.
[10754.34 → 10756.54] Where's the 7800 and where's the 7700?
[10756.96 → 10758.12] And I know, obviously.
[10758.34 → 10761.14] We want less expensive cards, right?
[10761.20 → 10761.50] Like, yeah.
[10761.72 → 10763.08] We want the latest architecture.
[10763.08 → 10766.62] But it's hard work.
[10767.20 → 10771.22] It's hard, gruelling, difficult, time-consuming work.
[10771.36 → 10774.50] And, you know, a company like AMD has a lot going on.
[10774.84 → 10779.06] They can't just focus on their discrete desktop GPUs.
[10779.10 → 10782.00] They've also got their scientific and data centre GPUs.
[10782.18 → 10788.36] They've got the GPU products that are built into their CPUs now, which are no longer really
[10788.36 → 10790.84] lag behind by as much in terms of technology.
[10790.84 → 10795.66] I would imagine that if their roadmap is anything to go on, we're going to see RDNA 3, RDNA 4,
[10796.60 → 10804.06] GPUs with much less lag compared to the first appearance of that architecture on a desktop
[10804.06 → 10805.40] add-in card, right?
[10805.48 → 10809.18] Don't forget about the custom silicon work that they do for partners like Sony and Microsoft
[10809.18 → 10809.92] and Valve.
[10810.44 → 10816.22] We have no idea what this chip in the ASUS DOG Ally is, but apparently it's custom silicon
[10816.22 → 10816.72] as well.
[10816.72 → 10822.04] And the thing is, you've only got, even if you're a company with the resources of AMD,
[10822.64 → 10826.74] you have a finite number of people on your team, right?
[10827.10 → 10832.54] And even if you saw a profitable opportunity, like, oh yeah, let's bring our mid-range GPU
[10832.54 → 10833.48] to market faster.
[10834.84 → 10836.04] You and what army?
[10836.04 → 10842.60] How many GPU experts are there on Earth that aren't already gainfully employed?
[10842.70 → 10845.86] It's not like you can just hire another 100-person team.
[10846.22 → 10847.90] It doesn't work like that, right?
[10848.78 → 10852.70] So we just have to be patient is the bottom line.
[10852.88 → 10854.46] It's frustrating, right?
[10854.54 → 10855.34] Like, obviously, yeah.
[10855.60 → 10856.60] Where's RDNA 4?
[10856.68 → 10857.08] Let's go!
[10857.08 → 10859.56] But it takes time.
[10859.66 → 10860.46] It's really challenging.
[10860.62 → 10863.08] A lot of massive respect for the people who work on this stuff.
[10865.82 → 10866.38] All right.
[10866.46 → 10867.86] Now, that's the end of the curated.
[10869.36 → 10870.16] Oh, okay.
[10870.22 → 10871.34] I can just, like, curate some.
[10871.60 → 10872.30] Yeah, go for it.
[10872.56 → 10872.68] Or read them out and respond to them.
[10872.68 → 10876.58] There's a massive mountain of incoming messages that I put.
[10876.70 → 10878.22] Well, they're all just, like, questions.
[10878.38 → 10879.64] Trying to text response to you.
[10879.64 → 10882.64] We have a thing that can display them at the end of the show if we don't get to them
[10882.64 → 10883.82] or play the rest of the queue.
[10883.82 → 10886.70] You know, new thing that we're trying.
[10886.96 → 10887.64] Give it a go.
[10889.34 → 10889.74] Yep.
[10891.20 → 10892.08] I don't know how.
[10892.08 → 10896.68] Maybe try to go through the massive mountain of messages and curate some of them while we
[10896.68 → 10897.46] do text responses.
[10897.56 → 10898.36] Yeah, let's do it.
[10898.48 → 10898.68] Sure.
[10898.86 → 10899.56] Let's go.
[10901.16 → 10902.04] This is cool.
[10902.78 → 10907.64] Nicholas T says, hey, Linus, I've been promoted to a new position where I measure individual
[10907.64 → 10908.50] transistors.
[10909.08 → 10912.40] Feels strange to be doing a job you couldn't show.
[10912.40 → 10916.48] Anything in particular surprise you during the lab tour at Micron?
[10916.70 → 10925.18] I think the most surprising thing at Micron was just how jazzed everyone was to be there.
[10926.30 → 10930.42] At somewhere like NVIDIA, where they have a more consumer-facing brand.
[10931.00 → 10937.10] Even someone like Intel, where they show up at gaming events and, you know, they have skulls
[10937.10 → 10939.00] and their branding or whatever.
[10939.90 → 10940.42] And they're cool.
[10940.52 → 10940.80] Yeah.
[10940.90 → 10946.08] You kind of expect to find, you know, passionate, enthusiast people.
[10946.48 → 10954.36] But Micron has just about the most boring corporate image, I think, in the tech industry.
[10954.36 → 10954.74] Right?
[10955.04 → 10956.88] Like, they're huge.
[10957.08 → 10957.86] They're enormous.
[10958.24 → 10959.76] They come from potato land.
[10959.76 → 10967.84] They make, you know, gosh darn it, the stablest DRAM chip.
[10968.16 → 10968.42] Blah.
[10968.60 → 10969.22] Let's go.
[10970.16 → 10977.02] But just how excited people seemed to work at Micron was really cool.
[10977.34 → 10978.16] Really inspiring.
[10978.16 → 10985.68] I managed to get one in that time.
[10986.58 → 10987.30] This is from Justin.
[10987.48 → 10989.98] Long-time GOD watcher and first-time buyer.
[10990.36 → 10994.06] I work as a network engineer for a large U.S. telecom company.
[10994.24 → 10998.00] If you could change one thing about the telecom industry, what would it be?
[10999.14 → 11002.28] The fact that you work for a large U.S. telecom company?
[11002.38 → 11002.52] No.
[11002.52 → 11003.68] I mean, well, sort of.
[11003.84 → 11009.72] Like, I really wish there was less consolidation in the telecom industry.
[11010.76 → 11018.40] I can see that Mr. Ryan Reynolds came out virtually unscathed from that whole Mint Mobile sale.
[11018.72 → 11023.88] But Mint Mobile seemed like, you know, a good thing.
[11024.36 → 11026.48] And now there's more consolidation.
[11026.94 → 11029.12] So, cool.
[11029.12 → 11035.88] You know, like, I would like to see more public ownership of basic infrastructure.
[11036.58 → 11050.78] I mean, I think it's fair to say that in some ways the fibre line between you and the nearest internet exchange is more important than the road between you and the nearest city.
[11050.78 → 11061.36] Like, as long as you can get basics like, you know, food, water, shelter, there are entire industries that just run on those fibre lines and don't need a road.
[11061.98 → 11065.58] When I was picking my apartment, that was like a huge portion of the decision-making.
[11065.96 → 11068.50] And a lot of people were quite surprised.
[11068.80 → 11069.74] But, like, I don't know.
[11069.84 → 11070.48] I stand by it.
[11070.48 → 11075.08] Okay, another one for you here.
[11075.18 → 11076.00] This is from Lilith.
[11076.86 → 11090.46] Talking of the Stream Deck and portables, do you think the future of them will be framework-like experience with modular parts, so the product doesn't function like a console, i.e. get outdated fast?
[11090.46 → 11090.76] Hmm.
[11090.76 → 11091.46] Hmm.
[11096.46 → 11098.46] I don't think it's that realistic.
[11098.90 → 11100.76] I think that...
[11102.18 → 11106.12] I mean, it could be done.
[11106.86 → 11109.58] Framework has shown us that the limit was our imagination.
[11109.96 → 11111.12] It wasn't the technology.
[11111.12 → 11113.44] So it could be done.
[11113.74 → 11115.84] But it would take someone to come in and do it.
[11115.92 → 11117.12] I mean, when someone...
[11117.70 → 11126.52] When ASUS was here for their allay preview, I told someone from their notebook team, because it's the same team working on the ally.
[11126.66 → 11130.24] I was like, hey, have you guys seen the Framework 16 yet?
[11130.62 → 11131.20] They're like, no.
[11131.36 → 11133.28] I'm like, okay, you guys need to sit up and pay attention.
[11133.50 → 11134.48] I'm an investor in Framework.
[11134.52 → 11135.70] I don't mind if they kick your butt.
[11135.82 → 11138.84] But, like, you guys need to sit up and pay attention.
[11138.84 → 11140.66] You guys need to come at this head on.
[11140.66 → 11142.70] And this is a serious thing that's happening now.
[11143.22 → 11149.50] There are going to be good devices that take this modular, more reusable approach to their design.
[11149.68 → 11152.82] And you guys have got to figure this out, because you can't just react to it later.
[11153.84 → 11160.12] And I had made a joke about how, you know, ha-ha, the allay is pretty cool.
[11160.28 → 11163.30] But, you know, I'd rather have one that was made by someone like a Framework,
[11163.30 → 11174.08] where I don't have to buy a whole new one in order to keep using my, oh, crap, my Hall Effect joysticks that I already upgraded,
[11174.40 → 11176.38] you know, my chassis to or whatever else.
[11176.46 → 11178.20] And they're like, oh, well, I hope they don't get into it.
[11178.24 → 11181.92] And like, no, what you should hope is that you guys do a better job and make upgradable stuff.
[11182.04 → 11183.92] So, yeah, I'd like to see it happen.
[11183.92 → 11187.34] But I don't know whether to hope for it or not.
[11187.62 → 11188.78] More modular electronics?
[11188.94 → 11190.60] It just hasn't been the trend up until now.
[11191.60 → 11193.38] It's hard when they get small like that, too.
[11193.84 → 11197.16] Yeah, and it is legitimately actually really challenging.
[11197.44 → 11197.48] Yeah.
[11198.18 → 11199.94] You know, what's so great about the Ally?
[11200.12 → 11203.80] Well, one of the things that's so great is it has this, like, phenomenal cooling system
[11203.80 → 11206.78] that is somehow super quiet and runs really cool.
[11207.16 → 11208.24] I haven't opened it yet.
[11208.26 → 11210.96] I actually haven't opened it yet, even though they're not here to supervise me anymore.
[11210.96 → 11211.98] Why haven't I opened it yet?
[11212.06 → 11213.20] Anyway, I haven't opened it yet.
[11213.54 → 11218.16] But I would imagine that a really finely tuned cooling solution
[11218.16 → 11222.34] is going to make it more difficult to have that main board be upgradable.
[11226.24 → 11228.90] Okay, next up, Linus and Luke,
[11228.96 → 11234.08] any suggestions on courses or resources to take my tech troubleshooting skills from?
[11234.46 → 11238.76] Have you tried turning it on back on again to something more refined?
[11239.86 → 11240.30] Really?
[11240.96 → 11244.04] It really depends on what you more specifically want to get into.
[11244.48 → 11249.82] If you're trying to get into, like, infrastructure stuff, IT admin type things,
[11250.32 → 11256.16] networking courses, networking certifications are often a pretty good angle to go in.
[11257.40 → 11261.78] There's also some stuff you can do with, oh, what's that?
[11264.04 → 11264.96] Active Directory.
[11265.80 → 11267.18] Getting into Active Directory.
[11267.42 → 11269.82] I'm assuming the direction you want to go into is IT.
[11269.82 → 11272.32] I don't know if that's a good assumption or not.
[11273.28 → 11278.32] But yeah, I'll get into some certification courses for, like, networking, Active Directory, stuff like that.
[11282.08 → 11282.72] Next up.
[11283.40 → 11285.04] Hi, LL plus D.
[11285.46 → 11291.68] Linus, do you know if there's any LTT garments that we either should or shouldn't use fabric softener on?
[11291.68 → 11295.86] I was taught to always use it, but I've also heard that it isn't good for some fabrics.
[11298.14 → 11299.14] I didn't know that.
[11299.54 → 11301.52] So, here's the thing.
[11302.22 → 11309.04] Bridget and I, in particular Bridget and I, often butt heads about proper treatment of garments.
[11309.04 → 11315.70] She will say things like, well, you're not supposed to put this in the dryer.
[11316.16 → 11317.26] Oh, that's going to happen anyway.
[11318.30 → 11319.52] Just, I was getting there.
[11320.06 → 11330.64] You know, you're not supposed to put this in the dryer and, you know, this, you know, appliquéing thing or whatever else and blah, blah, blah.
[11330.74 → 11331.30] And I'm like, right.
[11331.30 → 11333.96] But I'm going to put it in the dryer.
[11334.94 → 11338.28] So, where are we at with this?
[11339.40 → 11346.00] It drives her crazy because she and a lot of people on the team here do treat their clothes properly.
[11346.86 → 11355.54] But, you know, I want us to try to make everything okay for the people who don't.
[11355.66 → 11358.56] And, you know what, you do have to treat your clothes properly.
[11358.56 → 11362.38] Like a hoodie that you put in the dryer on high every time.
[11363.00 → 11366.84] If it has, if it's cotton, like it will shrink.
[11366.94 → 11367.80] It's natural fibre.
[11367.96 → 11369.00] It behaves how it behaves.
[11369.22 → 11370.86] And we can pre-shrink it and we do.
[11371.18 → 11374.62] But there's a limit to what you can do with pre-shrinking.
[11377.14 → 11381.72] So, with all of that said, we strive to make it so you can kind of do whatever you want.
[11381.94 → 11386.18] We do list the materials' composition on our products as we're legally required to do.
[11386.18 → 11393.40] So, if there are any materials that are good or bad with fabric softener, I guess you can just sort of follow whatever guidelines you can find.
[11394.18 → 11399.78] But, in general, we kind of try to make things that are resilient and last a long time.
[11404.08 → 11404.56] Dan?
[11404.56 → 11406.14] No, I didn't unmute myself.
[11406.94 → 11408.26] All right.
[11408.38 → 11412.20] Last one I've got here is Sal from Android Basher channel.
[11412.50 → 11420.94] My question to Linus is, what do you think about tech channels releasing videos a couple of minutes ahead of the official NDA timeline?
[11421.30 → 11422.70] It's happened multiple times.
[11424.40 → 11424.62] Oh.
[11424.62 → 11429.30] That's an interesting question.
[11431.66 → 11432.10] Hmm.
[11433.30 → 11434.34] I did it once.
[11435.34 → 11436.64] Maybe twice.
[11436.72 → 11437.06] I don't know.
[11437.26 → 11442.16] We released a video like one minute before the actual official embargo lift.
[11442.86 → 11446.34] And I think the idea was to see if it would have any kind of impact.
[11446.34 → 11449.92] And what we determined was that, A, no one noticed or cared.
[11450.26 → 11453.18] And, B, it didn't have an impact.
[11457.96 → 11458.36] Yeah.
[11458.60 → 11464.00] In the long term, what I've found is that, I mean, here, like, I can show you guys this, right?
[11464.40 → 11466.40] Like, here, let's go into the channel dashboard.
[11466.86 → 11469.06] Let's head to the analytics, shall we?
[11469.64 → 11471.10] You guys want to see some analytics?
[11471.10 → 11472.10] Yes.
[11475.76 → 11476.62] I know I do.
[11478.50 → 11479.90] These ionics be anal.
[11482.34 → 11482.92] Nice one.
[11483.26 → 11483.46] Ding?
[11484.92 → 11486.22] No, that's not worth a ding.
[11486.28 → 11487.12] That's not even a joke.
[11487.20 → 11487.98] That's just stupid.
[11488.38 → 11489.28] It's over there.
[11489.40 → 11490.02] It's not worth it.
[11490.02 → 11491.26] It's too far away.
[11492.92 → 11493.78] No dings for anal.
[11493.78 → 11495.32] You can tell what time of night it is.
[11495.70 → 11496.06] All right.
[11496.28 → 11497.62] So, first things first.
[11497.84 → 11500.14] You can see there are some videos coming soon.
[11500.14 → 11504.02] What's it like to work at Linus Media Group, the sequel?
[11504.80 → 11505.80] Did anyone talk to you?
[11506.06 → 11506.28] Nope.
[11506.76 → 11507.08] Really?
[11507.54 → 11508.14] Oh, interesting.
[11508.34 → 11509.56] Adam was in charge this time.
[11509.68 → 11510.16] Not included.
[11510.74 → 11511.32] Oh, all right.
[11511.44 → 11515.10] Well, I guess you didn't really work at LMG for most of the period we're covering here.
[11515.54 → 11517.00] Also, we have another one.
[11517.38 → 11520.32] Pushing the GT 1030 to the max.
[11521.90 → 11524.16] They'll have better titles when we actually release them.
[11524.58 → 11526.36] So, here, let's find a video.
[11526.46 → 11527.24] Okay, here, here, here.
[11527.38 → 11528.10] Here's one.
[11528.10 → 11530.48] No, this is the cleanest setup.
[11531.10 → 11534.44] So, let's go into, what is it?
[11534.52 → 11534.60] Reach.
[11534.60 → 11537.44] I hate, I still hate this dashboard.
[11537.72 → 11540.08] Oh, a bunch of really positive feedback on that video, by the way.
[11540.26 → 11540.58] Infuriating.
[11540.58 → 11541.44] Because it's already on Flow plane.
[11542.04 → 11542.82] Oh, which one?
[11543.58 → 11546.64] The what it's like to work at LMG.
[11546.76 → 11547.08] Oh, really?
[11547.26 → 11547.42] Yeah.
[11547.54 → 11547.78] Okay.
[11547.96 → 11549.82] Well, I'm not allowed to watch it.
[11549.94 → 11550.36] So, I guess.
[11550.60 → 11552.72] I'm just saying, Flow plane chat just said it's perfect.
[11552.72 → 11554.70] Oh, I'm glad it's, I'm really glad it's good.
[11555.20 → 11555.52] Cool.
[11557.48 → 11558.28] All right, anywho.
[11560.66 → 11561.70] What am I looking for?
[11561.78 → 11562.28] Ah, yes.
[11563.24 → 11563.64] Impressions.
[11563.84 → 11564.38] No, man.
[11564.48 → 11564.96] Where's the thing?
[11564.98 → 11565.30] Oh, yeah.
[11565.30 → 11565.70] Here we go.
[11565.74 → 11565.86] Here we go.
[11565.86 → 11567.74] We just like flash banged everyone, by the way.
[11568.02 → 11568.32] Sorry.
[11570.16 → 11570.88] Yeah, sorry.
[11570.96 → 11572.62] I don't have dark reader on this profile.
[11573.22 → 11573.60] Okay.
[11573.78 → 11574.88] Bell notifications sent.
[11574.96 → 11575.34] Here we go.
[11575.74 → 11581.38] They sent 911,000 subscribers a notification.
[11582.02 → 11587.26] The click-through rate is within the typical range for YouTube of 0.5 to 2.5 percent.
[11587.26 → 11588.46] 1.1 percent.
[11588.46 → 11594.62] Which means our views from bell notifications as a channel with 14, 15, however many millions
[11594.62 → 11599.06] of subscribers was 9,800.
[11599.44 → 11600.42] It's actually kind of amazing.
[11601.58 → 11605.84] This is a video with 3 million views.
[11607.50 → 11612.66] Total impressions, 38.2 million with a click-through rate of 5.4.
[11612.66 → 11618.56] The click-through rate of your impressions that you get from browse features, suggested
[11618.56 → 11627.02] videos, all these places that actually matter at all is three times, no, no, over four times
[11627.02 → 11627.42] higher.
[11628.18 → 11638.68] So the only thing that launching a little bit early could possibly do for you is give you
[11638.68 → 11643.86] a bit of an early boost on those notification views, right?
[11643.98 → 11648.82] Because one minute later, everyone's going to be on pretty much equal footing when it
[11648.82 → 11651.46] comes to browse and suggested and all that stuff.
[11653.62 → 11657.90] We're at the point now where we don't even really pay attention to what time of day we
[11657.90 → 11661.66] launch a video because we know that it's all going to come out in the wash in the long
[11661.66 → 11661.90] term.
[11663.12 → 11665.22] So that's where we're at on it.
[11665.28 → 11666.64] I really don't think it's a big deal.
[11666.64 → 11671.26] And I do think it's a big deal to break a legal agreement that you've signed.
[11671.38 → 11673.18] So you just should launch at the right time.
[11673.28 → 11674.36] Like, you know, everyone just should.
[11674.86 → 11678.38] But I don't think it's a big deal for you.
[11678.60 → 11682.48] Like, I don't think you're at a competitive disadvantage if other né'er-do-wells are pulling
[11682.48 → 11683.28] these kinds of moves.
[11685.84 → 11686.32] Okay.
[11686.60 → 11687.50] Hold on a second.
[11687.86 → 11693.40] Android Sasha is in the chat saying it might not impact you, but trust me, myself and several
[11693.40 → 11698.80] other channels I know have seen noticeable drops at the first hour reach.
[11700.94 → 11703.02] Yeah, but that first hour...
[11703.02 → 11711.10] The first hour is important, but it also isn't.
[11711.74 → 11712.64] Big picture.
[11712.64 → 11717.48] You've got to be looking at click-through.
[11717.76 → 11719.04] You've got to be looking at retention.
[11719.56 → 11723.44] Because that is ultimately what is going to drive that piece of content.
[11724.04 → 11727.26] And, you know, that's a real...
[11727.26 → 11728.86] It's a real challenge.
[11729.00 → 11729.68] It's way harder.
[11730.38 → 11734.90] You know, being the first one with content is a valid strategy.
[11735.34 → 11737.08] It's even a good strategy.
[11737.08 → 11739.70] But it's an exhausting strategy.
[11740.02 → 11741.64] And it's a very challenging strategy.
[11741.76 → 11743.48] And I don't think it's a sustainable strategy.
[11747.26 → 11748.88] Okay, got another one here for you.
[11749.04 → 11753.64] Linus and Luke, thoughts on Nebula's $250 lifetime membership.
[11754.16 → 11756.34] Isn't video streaming expensive?
[11757.14 → 11758.24] Are we talking about this already?
[11758.36 → 11759.68] Or did you and I just talk about that?
[11759.94 → 11761.40] I think you and I were talking about that.
[11761.46 → 11762.08] Yeah, it's...
[11762.08 → 11767.14] Okay, so Nebula is an interesting model, right?
[11767.64 → 11774.74] As far as I can tell, not a lot of people are actually watching on the site.
[11775.44 → 11778.56] And that doesn't really matter to them.
[11778.80 → 11781.60] Like, I don't think that really matters.
[11781.60 → 11784.98] Because it's far more of a just like, hey, I want to support creators.
[11785.68 → 11790.90] Here's a very sort of small amount of financial contribution.
[11792.08 → 11798.78] Of which very little makes its way to the, you know, the individual creator, right?
[11798.82 → 11800.86] Because you're not subscribing to an individual creator.
[11800.86 → 11802.44] You're subscribing to the entire platform.
[11802.66 → 11806.86] So each creator is getting a very small fraction of that amount.
[11806.92 → 11807.92] That's just sort of inherent.
[11808.04 → 11810.28] If you actually watched a lot on the platform.
[11810.28 → 11826.86] But the benefit of it is that they can achieve a level of scale that particularly boosted by the cross promotion that they do with Curiosity Stream has enabled them to reach a subscriber count that is quite substantial.
[11826.86 → 11832.28] So they've got these subscribers, right?
[11834.14 → 11837.68] They've got this sort of...
[11837.68 → 11839.10] Yeah, so they've got this user count.
[11839.34 → 11846.74] They've got this roster of creators that, as far as I can tell, are not really making a ton of money just from like Nebula payouts.
[11846.74 → 11856.84] As far as I can tell, a lot of the financial incentive for creators is promoting subscribing to Curiosity Stream because it includes Nebula.
[11858.22 → 11863.06] And so, which is good for creators because they get some revenue from Nebula.
[11863.20 → 11865.94] But more importantly, they have an ownership stake in Nebula.
[11866.12 → 11870.00] So any creators who join Nebula have an ownership stake in the platform.
[11870.00 → 11875.14] And that's, as far as I can tell, as an outsider, the real point.
[11875.32 → 11885.22] I don't think the point is the actual monthly checks that a creator with, you know, 20,000 YouTube subscribers and however many people are watching them on Nebula.
[11885.34 → 11890.20] Because you can kind of extrapolate that it's like probably like four people, right?
[11890.28 → 11894.72] So I don't think they're getting a significant amount of money on a monthly basis from Nebula.
[11894.72 → 11908.32] But I think the goal is that when Nebula exits, when it sells, everyone who joined as a creator is going to get a piece of that action.
[11909.44 → 11915.58] So with that in mind, what does a $250 lifetime subscription to a streaming platform look like?
[11915.58 → 11929.60] Well, it looks like a streaming platform that doesn't actually stream a lot of video, wanting to boost subscriber counts so that when they eventually exit in some way or IPO or whatever it is that they plan to do,
[11929.82 → 11935.68] they will be able to have a bigger payout for their shareholders who are the creators, which is not a bad thing.
[11935.72 → 11944.96] It's just a very different model from the way that we structure things, which is generally more ongoing sustainability and less exit strategy.
[11944.96 → 11950.40] You also sometimes just need a burst of, I've been trying to respond to messages, so I didn't listen to all of that,
[11950.48 → 11957.24] but you sometimes need a burst of income if you're trying to avoid outside investor stuff.
[11957.70 → 11964.20] And it might be worth lower returns in the future for that burst of income now, depending on what you're trying to do.
[11969.90 → 11970.90] There's like a lot.
[11971.12 → 11972.62] Yeah, there's like a lot.
[11972.62 → 11975.70] There's too many sitting and incoming.
[11975.84 → 11977.70] We need to be responding to these faster.
[11977.90 → 11978.10] Yep.
[11978.58 → 11980.70] I'm working on it.
[11982.60 → 11985.10] We can talk about it some more after the show as well.
[11985.12 → 11985.18] Hit me.
[11985.52 → 11986.04] All right.
[11986.12 → 11986.52] Anonymous.
[11987.26 → 11990.82] Have you ever seen a Surface Electron display monitor?
[11991.42 → 11994.20] If not, do you think you can get a hold of one?
[11995.08 → 11995.84] You ever heard of one of these?
[11996.04 → 11996.24] SED?
[11996.50 → 11997.24] SED monitor.
[11997.24 → 12001.38] My understanding is outside a couple of trade show demos, they never existed.
[12001.38 → 12013.70] It was supposed to be a replacement for CRT that was not as thin as LCD, but with the contrast and brightness benefits of CRT and response time benefits of CRT.
[12013.82 → 12015.72] Canon was working on it, if I recall correctly.
[12015.94 → 12019.88] I was very excited about it at the time, if it's the one I'm thinking of.
[12019.88 → 12030.64] And I was really disappointed that it never made it to light, but OLED has pretty much negated any need for SED to make it to market.
[12031.88 → 12032.70] All right.
[12033.22 → 12038.72] What are the odds of LTT partnering with fixity for an orange and black precision driver kit?
[12038.72 → 12042.02] I don't know.
[12042.08 → 12045.06] I don't really know if that's like fixity's model.
[12046.68 → 12057.70] I, yeah, I could definitely see us doing more tools in the future, but I don't really see any reason why either of us would necessarily co-brand with the other.
[12058.18 → 12064.86] Like having more hands in the pot is, I don't know, not really, not really beneficial to either of us, I don't think.
[12064.86 → 12069.80] Love your work and would love to work for you.
[12069.88 → 12072.64] Do you guys still offer relocation assistance?
[12073.78 → 12074.18] I don't know.
[12074.26 → 12075.96] Why don't you get a job and find out?
[12076.90 → 12078.46] Oh, check our job postings.
[12081.22 → 12081.92] Let's see.
[12082.38 → 12088.64] Any chance on releasing a case for screwdriver that can also fit all the bit sets?
[12091.92 → 12092.36] Yes.
[12092.36 → 12095.08] It'll be a long time, though.
[12095.12 → 12096.12] You know how slow we are.
[12096.56 → 12103.74] And that's a product that I don't think we would do just like a less expensive, faster Chinese mould for, like we did for the cable management arches.
[12104.26 → 12110.62] That's the kind of product that we would probably want to get done by IT.
[12110.84 → 12113.32] It's either innovative or innovation tool and die.
[12113.50 → 12115.16] Something like a local company.
[12115.16 → 12120.48] We'd probably get the moulds made there because we'd want it to be like on par with the quality of the screwdriver that it goes with.
[12120.56 → 12120.68] Right.
[12120.74 → 12123.30] So I don't see that happening anytime super soon.
[12124.66 → 12127.90] What is your favourite small form factor case right now?
[12129.16 → 12133.00] Oh, we were actually shooting a video about this new one from Dan case.
[12133.00 → 12136.66] That is just so cool.
[12137.58 → 12138.90] Adam was telling me about it.
[12138.96 → 12139.68] It looks amazing.
[12140.16 → 12140.60] Yeah.
[12141.08 → 12142.72] What's the man?
[12142.88 → 12142.98] What?
[12143.34 → 12143.64] Dang it.
[12143.70 → 12143.98] Is it?
[12144.16 → 12145.24] Oh, is it out?
[12146.48 → 12146.90] Uh.
[12146.90 → 12149.92] Yeah.
[12150.12 → 12150.74] Yeah, this one.
[12150.98 → 12151.24] Okay.
[12151.40 → 12152.06] Super cool.
[12152.26 → 12152.40] Yeah.
[12152.74 → 12153.78] C4 SFX.
[12154.22 → 12155.84] This thing is sick.
[12156.44 → 12157.08] It's sick.
[12157.32 → 12158.14] Watch the video.
[12158.34 → 12158.86] It's sick.
[12159.08 → 12160.24] That's all I have to say about that.
[12161.10 → 12164.44] I built one in a previous Dan case, and it was just incredible.
[12164.54 → 12165.56] No, this one's so much better.
[12165.68 → 12165.90] I know.
[12166.12 → 12167.58] Your Dan case is crap.
[12167.90 → 12168.22] It's okay.
[12168.30 → 12168.56] I gave it away.
[12168.56 → 12171.82] Your name is Dan and you still don't know anything about Dan case anymore.
[12171.82 → 12172.38] I know nothing.
[12172.46 → 12173.42] It's new Dan case.
[12173.50 → 12174.18] It's a new game.
[12174.46 → 12175.10] Oh my gosh.
[12175.64 → 12176.36] I've been replaced.
[12177.00 → 12177.48] Okay.
[12177.98 → 12183.52] As someone who's watched since the kitchen set days, is there any videos you look back
[12183.52 → 12188.76] on from the early days of LTT and want to recreate for old times sake?
[12189.46 → 12189.82] Ooh.
[12191.34 → 12191.86] Recreate?
[12191.94 → 12194.70] I mean, I wish we could do classic Scrapyard Wars again.
[12195.12 → 12195.32] Yeah.
[12195.68 → 12199.36] We had a question about that in the pre-show, and I was like, man, it just doesn't, it can't
[12199.36 → 12199.58] work.
[12199.72 → 12200.30] It doesn't work?
[12200.66 → 12200.84] Yeah.
[12201.06 → 12201.98] Then, I don't know.
[12202.04 → 12202.42] It's funny.
[12202.42 → 12205.90] Like, yeah, I'd love to do whole room water cooling again.
[12206.36 → 12211.26] But we can't just interrupt everyone's jobs to help us put fittings on things anymore.
[12211.38 → 12213.46] It just doesn't really like work that way here.
[12213.68 → 12214.40] Certain scale issues.
[12214.62 → 12214.90] Yeah.
[12214.90 → 12221.42] I've fairly often come back to the like, this is not that old of a video.
[12221.52 → 12221.78] Okay.
[12221.90 → 12226.50] It's a very old video, but it's not that old of a video in kitchen in the house scale.
[12226.66 → 12227.20] You know what I mean?
[12227.20 → 12230.78] Uh, but the WTF is going on with DX12 and Vulcan.
[12231.80 → 12234.08] I've often just kind of personally wondered that.
[12234.22 → 12235.88] Like, what's the current state of those?
[12237.06 → 12244.46] Because, like, when I launch a game and I see options right now, I don't, I'm not 100% confident
[12244.46 → 12245.32] in which one to choose.
[12246.22 → 12246.70] You know?
[12246.70 → 12247.18] Yeah.
[12247.66 → 12248.74] So, yeah.
[12248.98 → 12249.42] Go Vulcan.
[12249.50 → 12249.94] Be cool.
[12251.40 → 12255.92] Well, no, but even, even like, okay, because that video went more in depth on these things.
[12256.02 → 12258.84] Even when it's like, do you want to launch in DX11 or DX12?
[12259.94 → 12261.70] If it's only DX is the option.
[12261.96 → 12264.88] For a while there, it was 11, not 12.
[12265.22 → 12265.44] Uh-huh.
[12265.44 → 12269.86] I mean, I still have issues with, like, Anna, as far as I know.
[12269.86 → 12270.00] Yeah.
[12270.00 → 12272.16] They've just, like, never patched the bugginess with DX12.
[12272.16 → 12276.36] No, but, like, for real, a lot of games that came around that era, it was better to run
[12276.36 → 12277.78] them in DX11 than 12.
[12278.00 → 12281.66] So, like, is that completely fixed for new games?
[12282.26 → 12284.20] What kind of stragglers are we looking at?
[12284.82 → 12285.50] Stuff like that.
[12286.64 → 12287.52] I think it'd be interesting.
[12290.38 → 12290.86] Okay.
[12290.86 → 12296.50] Hey, Luke, are there any plans for adding split-screen support for the iPadOS app on
[12296.50 → 12297.18] Float plane?
[12297.36 → 12301.42] Oh, we don't really do specific for iPad development.
[12302.64 → 12303.20] Got them.
[12303.72 → 12306.26] So, like, not in the near future.
[12306.72 → 12309.50] And, Linus, any timeline on the luxury backpack?
[12313.68 → 12317.78] Ugh, this is probably a question you were expecting me to answer extremely quickly.
[12318.80 → 12319.42] Oh, boy.
[12319.60 → 12320.38] It's not, though.
[12320.86 → 12321.40] Oh, boy.
[12321.70 → 12323.74] Okay, first, it's not luxury.
[12323.96 → 12324.82] It's lux.
[12325.40 → 12325.84] Ugh.
[12328.54 → 12329.82] That is what we're going to call it.
[12329.90 → 12330.70] We're just going to call it lux.
[12331.22 → 12332.02] Okay, all right.
[12332.08 → 12332.20] Fine.
[12332.60 → 12336.80] Second of all, I don't know.
[12336.80 → 12341.36] I don't want to release something that I'm not completely confident in.
[12341.96 → 12345.96] And right now, I'm really happy with the state that it's in.
[12345.96 → 12351.28] But what I don't know is how long will I be happy with the state that it's in.
[12351.28 → 12353.02] So, whoops.
[12353.80 → 12354.70] What did I press?
[12355.72 → 12356.24] There we go.
[12356.30 → 12356.66] Thanks, Dan.
[12356.66 → 12360.44] So, okay.
[12360.44 → 12363.04] There are a couple of things that are wrong with this prototype.
[12363.32 → 12365.52] The water bottle holder is a little bit too tight.
[12365.92 → 12368.74] I have a similar issue with some of the pockets over here.
[12369.74 → 12373.96] Other than that, it's basically perfect.
[12374.96 → 12380.22] I've noticed that as it's broken in, this zipper at the very front, this one right here,
[12380.58 → 12386.80] has turned from kind of straight to more of like a smile.
[12387.20 → 12388.18] Like it's kind of, oh, yeah, here we go.
[12388.22 → 12388.86] Here's a better angle.
[12389.12 → 12390.28] I'll get you guys this angle here.
[12390.70 → 12392.60] So, it's more like kind of curved now.
[12392.86 → 12393.52] So, you can see that.
[12393.84 → 12397.92] But that's like a natural thing that's going to happen with a leather product, right?
[12397.92 → 12404.10] Like it tends to, you know, you can see the water bottle bulge a little bit more than you could see with the
[12404.10 → 12411.46] with the, oh, it starts with an R or whatever, with the reprieve fabric that we use for the regular backpack.
[12414.10 → 12423.32] My issue is that this is a vegan leather, which is like probably the most successful rebrand in all history.
[12424.56 → 12425.82] Leather to vegan leather?
[12425.82 → 12426.62] To vegan leather.
[12426.62 → 12427.02] Yeah.
[12427.02 → 12429.72] Like fake leather to vegan leather?
[12429.90 → 12430.04] Yeah.
[12430.48 → 12434.42] Anyway, this is, this is a vegan leather product, but it's not just like plastic.
[12434.74 → 12436.26] This is an apple leather.
[12436.42 → 12442.46] So, it's like a, like a fruit based vegan leather that behaves.
[12443.40 → 12446.92] Boy, does it ever feel and act a lot like leather.
[12447.66 → 12456.34] From the manufacturer, they've told us that you can, you can kind of, you could buff scuffs out of it with, with polish, just like with leather.
[12456.34 → 12459.68] Um, they've told us the durability should be very similar to leather.
[12459.68 → 12464.74] I haven't observed any issues with it in my time using it, but I've only been using it for a couple of months.
[12464.74 → 12474.04] Can I draw long-term, you know, years long conclusions about this fabric based on the time I've spent with it?
[12474.04 → 12477.38] Um, not with 100% confidence.
[12477.38 → 12480.24] And this is not going to be a cheap product.
[12480.24 → 12487.02] Uh, I would be surprised if it isn't at least double of what the regular backpack costs.
[12487.02 → 12489.96] Because, A, the material is far more costly.
[12490.48 → 12493.50] And, B, working with it is far more costly.
[12493.76 → 12494.84] It's far more time-consuming.
[12496.44 → 12500.74] So, it's pretty much ready for us to place an order.
[12501.28 → 12504.92] We would have to make a couple small changes to the, uh, to the construction.
[12505.48 → 12506.30] And we're ready to go.
[12506.30 → 12514.18] But, I've been holding off because I just want it to be perfect.
[12514.28 → 12519.92] And I don't, like, I've asked if, uh, so, so, uh, we have a partner that does a lot of material testing for us called China.
[12520.62 → 12525.02] And, I, I've asked, is there anything we can do in terms of, like, long-term durability tests on it?
[12525.04 → 12528.30] Or, like, can we do scuff tests, and then can we get polishes and try to polish it?
[12528.30 → 12530.44] Like, what can we do to, can you figure this out, guys?
[12531.06 → 12532.50] Um, and so, we're working on that.
[12533.36 → 12534.22] But, it's going to take time.
[12534.50 → 12537.06] I've got a lot of people in the chat asking, well, why not just make it out of real leather?
[12538.50 → 12541.26] Do you want it to be $1,500?
[12542.04 → 12542.58] Two grand?
[12543.10 → 12545.12] I'm like, okay.
[12548.28 → 12548.68] Yeah.
[12548.84 → 12551.88] That would be, leather is freaking hard to work with.
[12551.88 → 12556.24] And, like, if you're spending that much on leather, uh, seam stitching can be an issue.
[12556.36 → 12557.96] So, are these hand-stitched bags now?
[12558.22 → 12558.58] Yeah.
[12558.64 → 12560.06] Well, yeah, that's the thing, right?
[12560.14 → 12560.34] Yeah.
[12561.38 → 12566.46] I'm adding that clarification because I'm sure someone's Googling how much leather costs, and they're going to be like,
[12566.48 → 12567.62] No, it's not the...
[12567.62 → 12568.96] No, it's the workmanship.
[12569.06 → 12570.12] There's more to it than that.
[12570.26 → 12570.48] Yep.
[12574.10 → 12574.50] Okay.
[12577.38 → 12577.78] Ooh!
[12579.00 → 12579.40] Okay.
[12581.24 → 12581.52] Um.
[12584.66 → 12585.02] Huh.
[12585.22 → 12585.58] Okay.
[12586.04 → 12588.54] Well, yeah, we might have to, we might have to call it.
[12588.54 → 12591.46] Are there, are there any more, like, outstanding ones you guys see in this?
[12591.84 → 12599.40] You guys are sending, you guys got to send more just like, hey, hi, mom, you know, stuff, because we actually can't do this.
[12599.88 → 12602.18] Uh, yes, the UV blocking hoodie is still coming.
[12603.06 → 12604.24] Um, you know what?
[12604.24 → 12608.14] Why don't we try and rapid fire a few?
[12608.66 → 12610.02] Let's, let's, let's try it.
[12610.20 → 12610.34] Sure.
[12611.12 → 12611.46] Okay.
[12611.66 → 12612.54] How are scientific...
[12612.54 → 12617.08] Anonymous asks, how are scientific backgrounds understood or perceived within the software development field?
[12618.02 → 12619.44] That's coming from an astrophysicist.
[12619.44 → 12621.62] How are scientific backgrounds understood or perceived?
[12621.62 → 12622.78] That's not rapid fire enough.
[12623.34 → 12623.92] He shrugged.
[12624.00 → 12624.56] Next question.
[12624.72 → 12625.02] Okay.
[12625.40 → 12628.88] Robert says, can't wait to set this up on my test bench at work.
[12629.20 → 12631.00] Microsoft Loop just went live for my org.
[12631.26 → 12636.94] What's one non-AI product that is upcoming or live that you guys, especially Dan, are super excited for?
[12638.32 → 12639.64] Non-AI product.
[12639.80 → 12640.92] Hey, I can read these too.
[12642.30 → 12642.66] Okay.
[12643.86 → 12644.70] So what is it?
[12644.74 → 12645.66] It's especially Dan.
[12645.66 → 12649.10] Uh, I, I didn't actually catch that.
[12649.18 → 12649.48] I don't know.
[12649.86 → 12652.04] Um, non-tech products.
[12652.92 → 12653.80] No, non-AI.
[12654.22 → 12655.06] Non-AI product?
[12655.20 → 12657.46] This rapid fire concept is not working very well.
[12657.48 → 12658.20] Not working at all.
[12658.26 → 12658.50] Okay.
[12658.60 → 12659.52] Literally didn't listen.
[12659.64 → 12660.94] Let's, let's read along with you then.
[12661.36 → 12664.40] Uh, non-AI, uh, AR, AR.
[12664.72 → 12666.66] I want AR to be good one day.
[12667.04 → 12667.40] Love it.
[12667.58 → 12667.92] I don't care.
[12667.92 → 12668.24] Nice, good answer.
[12668.24 → 12668.88] Okay, Adam.
[12669.32 → 12674.42] If there's going to be a Linus Tech Tips TV series or movie, who would you cast to play you?
[12675.66 → 12677.54] Reynolds.
[12678.30 → 12678.90] To play you?
[12679.06 → 12679.28] Yeah.
[12679.62 → 12681.92] Oh, I was thinking, um, the other Ryan.
[12682.16 → 12686.92] I've just had the amount of times, you remember the, the, the...
[12686.92 → 12688.16] Ryan Gosling.
[12688.56 → 12690.34] Ryan Gosling looks so much more like you.
[12690.40 → 12691.28] Sorry, that's the one I meant.
[12691.38 → 12692.48] I'm terrible with actor names.
[12692.68 → 12693.22] I'm crying out loud, Luke.
[12693.84 → 12695.32] Yeah, Ryan Gosling for Luke.
[12695.32 → 12696.12] He would nail it.
[12696.22 → 12696.42] Yeah.
[12697.02 → 12697.78] I'm with that.
[12697.80 → 12698.56] That is who I meant.
[12698.72 → 12699.20] I apologize.
[12699.20 → 12700.56] I have no idea for me.
[12700.64 → 12701.06] I'm sorry.
[12701.18 → 12702.74] I also don't know too many actors.
[12703.52 → 12704.22] Okay, next.
[12704.22 → 12707.20] Oh, okay.
[12707.24 → 12707.74] I was...
[12707.74 → 12708.10] Okay.
[12708.26 → 12708.80] Hello, gentlemen.
[12708.92 → 12711.40] What is your favourite controller to use with PC?
[12711.58 → 12713.48] It's the Xbox controller for both of us.
[12713.74 → 12713.90] Yeah.
[12714.16 → 12715.22] Other than Nelson Keyboard.
[12715.36 → 12716.80] PS4 for him, Xbox for us.
[12717.22 → 12717.54] Cool.
[12717.70 → 12718.06] Oh, yeah.
[12718.10 → 12718.64] Stick Drift.
[12718.84 → 12719.10] Yep.
[12719.36 → 12719.62] Yeah.
[12719.66 → 12719.96] Sorry.
[12720.02 → 12720.64] That's a thing.
[12720.88 → 12725.66] Um, so I really like the King Kong 2, but I don't use it on PC mostly because I just
[12725.66 → 12726.52] haven't.
[12726.52 → 12727.60] I just, I just didn't think of it.
[12727.62 → 12728.12] I just have it.
[12728.12 → 12730.30] I have it paired to my Switch and I just didn't think about it.
[12730.46 → 12730.58] Yeah.
[12730.58 → 12731.70] Okay.
[12732.70 → 12738.06] Uh, Ian, in the spirit of the AI heavy show this week, with the potential of AI providing
[12738.06 → 12742.48] scammers with more powerful tools, has anyone thought of newer safety measures to take?
[12742.60 → 12743.86] That's going to be a big problem.
[12744.28 → 12744.70] It's a big problem now.
[12744.70 → 12747.28] All I've really seen is AI fighting back.
[12747.70 → 12749.44] That's the only new thing I've seen in that realm.
[12749.78 → 12754.80] Jared says, I'm a brand-new mainframe storage admin, and I was super excited to see your Z16
[12754.80 → 12756.08] and mainframe mentioned last.
[12756.08 → 12760.24] When do you foresee any other potential future uses in mainframe tech?
[12760.74 → 12766.94] I mean, I think, I think Luke kind of outlined what is going to be the biggest one is these
[12766.94 → 12768.72] internal large language models.
[12768.72 → 12771.44] Like that's the way I think, I think you're right.
[12771.62 → 12772.86] I don't think there's any avoiding it.
[12772.96 → 12773.48] I think I called it.
[12773.52 → 12776.68] Was that like three weeks ago when I talked to you in your office, and I was like, this
[12776.68 → 12779.98] is like my most long shot one so far.
[12780.08 → 12780.40] Yeah.
[12780.40 → 12781.44] There are companies already doing it.
[12781.52 → 12782.88] I thought it was like a year out.
[12784.70 → 12785.94] It's a hundred percent already happening.
[12786.08 → 12792.46] So Paul L asks, ever considered consulting services like a Mat Pat from Game Theorist,
[12792.84 → 12796.36] LTT's culture, employee, customer treatment are really powerful for professionals and
[12796.36 → 12796.66] orgs.
[12796.72 → 12798.32] They often ground me when managing people.
[12798.58 → 12801.88] I mean, the way that I see it, here it is.
[12802.08 → 12803.74] You're asking me, we're talking about it.
[12803.78 → 12804.48] Let's talk about it.
[12804.52 → 12806.26] Not for very long because this is rapid fire.
[12807.08 → 12812.36] But the point is that, I don't know, my uncle kind of sat me down and said, you know,
[12812.38 → 12814.88] the worst kind of business is a consulting business.
[12814.88 → 12816.52] And I kind of said, oh, well, why?
[12816.88 → 12819.74] Because like consulting seems like it pays a lot of money.
[12819.98 → 12821.62] Consultants, like that's a stereotype, right?
[12821.66 → 12826.26] It's consultants make a lot of money compared to people who in a lot of cases are actually
[12826.26 → 12826.66] do things.
[12826.66 → 12826.80] Yeah.
[12826.80 → 12828.74] More qualified and actually do things.
[12828.74 → 12833.58] And he said, the reason the consulting business is the worst kind of business is because it's
[12833.58 → 12834.14] not scalable.
[12834.44 → 12837.84] If you want to double your revenue, then you can raise your rates.
[12838.04 → 12844.06] Sure, you could double your rates, but there's a finite amount of doubling that you can do
[12844.06 → 12844.88] to your rates.
[12844.88 → 12848.32] So what you need to do then is you need to double your consultants.
[12848.60 → 12849.94] You need to double your staff.
[12850.50 → 12856.54] And at some point, you collapse under your own weight unless you can somehow scale the
[12856.54 → 12861.38] consulting that you do to many, many, many more, many more people per consultant.
[12861.74 → 12863.02] And I kind of went, oh, okay.
[12863.06 → 12863.86] So like YouTube then.
[12864.72 → 12865.16] Okay.
[12865.22 → 12866.34] So we've solved this.
[12866.38 → 12868.32] I don't need to be a one-on-one consultant anymore.
[12868.32 → 12871.36] I could just, you know, I could just scale.
[12871.86 → 12876.32] And so we, we, everything we do here, we're trying to even Sancho, right?
[12876.44 → 12878.18] So how can we scale Sancho?
[12879.04 → 12880.20] By doing it faster.
[12880.34 → 12880.52] Yes.
[12880.56 → 12880.98] Thank you, Luke.
[12881.00 → 12881.62] That's very helpful.
[12882.56 → 12884.52] And also by chopping it up into clips.
[12886.14 → 12893.70] So, you know, by, by leveraging it to sponsors and also leveraging AdSense and also creating
[12893.70 → 12898.72] benefits to float plane subscribers to subscribe for a better Sancho experience with better audio
[12898.72 → 12905.48] quality by creating merch messages so that we can create more content for Sancho.
[12905.58 → 12908.24] Thanks to you guys asking wonderful questions like this.
[12908.74 → 12911.82] So we are, we're quadruple dipping on Sancho.
[12911.96 → 12916.70] That's something that a consulting business is always going to struggle with because unless
[12917.38 → 12923.58] you can find and train consultants at an astronomical rate, you're always going to be limited to
[12923.58 → 12925.82] linear rather than exponential growth.
[12927.64 → 12931.46] Daniel asks, I was wondering if you could explain some of the benefits and drawbacks of building
[12931.46 → 12933.62] a home PC in a rack versus a tower.
[12934.84 → 12937.52] Tower is easier, better hardware compatibility.
[12938.20 → 12939.78] Racks go in racks.
[12940.08 → 12941.38] That's the main benefit of them.
[12943.48 → 12946.06] What happened to the G Suite Google Drive backup?
[12946.34 → 12948.20] Too slow or too close to privateering?
[12948.54 → 12950.30] I think we ran into some issues with it.
[12950.56 → 12953.10] Jake would actually be a better person to answer that question.
[12953.58 → 12957.58] I think it had something to do with rate limiting or something.
[12957.96 → 12962.34] Yeah, I think it was overcapable, but it was like going to involve a bunch of like hassle
[12962.34 → 12965.80] and scripting, and realistically it was going to like cost a bunch of money to actually take
[12965.80 → 12967.52] the data back out if we ever needed it anyway.
[12967.64 → 12969.64] And we just didn't really care that much because it's the vault.
[12969.86 → 12971.44] It's like a proof of concept more than anything.
[12972.06 → 12975.54] Charles says, are you concerned about create a warehouse working with other creators when
[12975.54 → 12978.62] they come to you with a product that you've either been thinking about making or a product
[12978.62 → 12979.80] you think you could do better?
[12979.80 → 12981.48] Yeah, this is a very valid concern.
[12981.74 → 12985.62] Like if we're kind of say, okay, actually there's a perfect example of this.
[12985.76 → 12988.72] We wanted to do a lighter for a really long time.
[12988.78 → 12991.14] We had some cool, fun ideas for a lighter project.
[12991.28 → 12994.38] Kyle actually talked about it in his float plane exclusive, meet the team.
[12995.24 → 12998.60] And, you know, I was looking at, you know, Hack smith's lighter.
[12998.86 → 13003.18] They have a they have a one coming or something, and we wanted to carry it on our store.
[13003.22 → 13006.94] And I was like, okay, are we going to be in an awkward position where if we release a lighter,
[13006.94 → 13008.72] they're going to feel like, oh, well, screw you, buddy.
[13009.66 → 13010.92] You're releasing your own lighter.
[13011.06 → 13013.18] I mean, I don't know.
[13013.22 → 13014.40] I mean, there's a precedent for it.
[13014.44 → 13018.48] It's not like New egg doesn't carry Rosewall cases, which is their home brand.
[13018.48 → 13020.04] And they also carry Corsair cases.
[13020.26 → 13020.80] You just have to be.
[13020.96 → 13021.70] Seems chill with it.
[13021.76 → 13026.48] Like even more, not that you aren't already, but even more careful to not have things that
[13026.48 → 13028.36] could be perceived as like a copycat.
[13028.84 → 13029.16] Yeah.
[13029.72 → 13030.64] Yeah, that's fair.
[13030.64 → 13036.44] Michael asks, do you have any advice or regrets on raising children in regard to technology
[13036.44 → 13036.96] or the internet?
[13037.24 → 13038.48] Don't use it as a crutch.
[13038.86 → 13039.46] Talk to kids.
[13040.10 → 13041.78] That's, that's the key.
[13043.30 → 13043.70] Joseph.
[13044.06 → 13046.48] I remember when the streams, the camo coat.
[13046.62 → 13048.22] Yeah, we're talking about the camo coat again.
[13048.58 → 13052.32] A decade ago in high school, you inspired me to build a PC so I could play Planetwide 2
[13052.32 → 13053.18] and Battlefield 3.
[13053.18 → 13056.32] What is your most nostalgic gaming era?
[13056.32 → 13061.74] Google great games 2004, man.
[13062.78 → 13063.88] Great games 2004.
[13064.24 → 13064.82] It's a thing.
[13065.96 → 13070.18] I think my nostalgic gaming era goes, goes back farther though.
[13070.24 → 13073.84] I think it's more just like when you kind of crystallized when you...
[13073.84 → 13075.38] 2004 was just a hell of a year though.
[13075.64 → 13078.08] I'm actually like pretty, I think we've talked about this before.
[13078.18 → 13079.30] Did Warcraft 3 come out in 2004?
[13079.30 → 13081.22] Because I was going to say Warcraft 3.
[13081.22 → 13085.82] Half-Life 2, original World of Warcraft, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, The Sims 2,
[13085.82 → 13091.80] Halo 2, Burnout 3, Far Cry the original, Counter-Strike Source, Battlefield Vietnam,
[13092.46 → 13100.12] Star Wars Battlefront, the one that people actually liked, Doom 3, Metal Gear 3, Sid Meier's
[13100.12 → 13102.38] Pirates, Fable, Unreal 2004.
[13103.32 → 13104.40] Fable as well?
[13104.54 → 13108.82] Ninja Garden, Driver, which I actually thought was cool, but not everyone thinks he's cool.
[13108.82 → 13111.66] So there's a ton.
[13111.98 → 13114.10] Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2.
[13116.00 → 13117.12] Best year in gaming ever.
[13117.42 → 13119.32] Splinter Cell, Pandora tomorrow.
[13119.44 → 13120.98] I don't know if that was great or not.
[13122.98 → 13123.34] Okay.
[13123.54 → 13124.44] It was a pretty wild year.
[13124.46 → 13126.90] That's fair enough, but I think for me, it's got to be like SNES era.
[13127.52 → 13127.86] Yeah, yeah.
[13128.04 → 13128.92] Yeah, I'm just old.
[13129.28 → 13130.32] That's, I mean, that's fine.
[13130.40 → 13133.06] I just, I like talking about 2004 because there's one hell of a year.
[13133.06 → 13137.82] All right, I replied to a couple text ones.
[13138.10 → 13139.36] Are they still coming in?
[13140.02 → 13140.58] Yeah, yeah.
[13140.60 → 13142.78] You got to do one every 25 seconds.
[13142.90 → 13143.26] Come on, guys.
[13143.72 → 13144.60] Is that the rate?
[13145.44 → 13147.42] Well, not today, but most of the day, yeah.
[13148.98 → 13151.26] Yeah, you guys were just basically treading water with these.
[13151.46 → 13153.44] I'm sorry to dump that on you.
[13154.00 → 13154.34] No, it's okay.
[13154.36 → 13155.00] We just got to keep pumping.
[13155.18 → 13155.90] We'll figure it out.
[13156.22 → 13159.18] With the current rise of AI technology, what do you think about students pursuing careers
[13159.18 → 13159.88] as web developers?
[13159.94 → 13161.06] Oh, I was currently insulating that with text.
[13161.06 → 13163.28] I replied to that one I said pretty tough right now, not going to lie.
[13163.30 → 13163.92] It's pretty tough right now.
[13164.36 → 13165.68] We will still, hold on.
[13165.78 → 13169.26] We will still need developers for like a long time.
[13169.88 → 13170.80] Very long time.
[13170.88 → 13174.02] People saying that it's going to fully replace developers right now are just wrong.
[13174.86 → 13177.84] Speaking of that, I think you already replied to that one too.
[13178.02 → 13178.18] Yeah.
[13178.92 → 13179.76] Oh, it's gone.
[13180.44 → 13180.70] Okay.
[13180.90 → 13181.48] What's going on?
[13181.94 → 13182.32] Keep going.
[13182.32 → 13184.84] I think we're all doing the same things on top of each other.
[13185.40 → 13187.26] But yeah, we're going to need developers for a long time.
[13187.26 → 13191.50] There are going to be companies that try to shrink because of this type of stuff.
[13191.74 → 13193.20] They're going to run into some problems.
[13193.56 → 13198.32] A lot of the things that AI development is currently doing is not like super advanced.
[13198.40 → 13200.52] And a lot of it still needs a guiding hand from developers.
[13200.88 → 13203.86] I do think junior positions are going to be the first ones to take a hit.
[13204.00 → 13204.90] I think that makes sense.
[13205.86 → 13208.80] But companies will still need senior developers.
[13209.26 → 13211.94] So yeah, get after it.
[13211.94 → 13218.26] The recent examples of AMD and Intel GPUs performance gaining over time with driver updates.
[13218.38 → 13223.72] The lab's going to test to make sure that the driver updates are keeping up with performance.
[13224.06 → 13225.34] We retest for every review.
[13227.02 → 13234.94] So yep, you're going to always be able to trust that the numbers you're looking at from our latest content is based on the latest drivers.
[13235.88 → 13239.46] And Linus, how do you handle determining trustability in your employees?
[13239.46 → 13243.68] I tend to be, if anything, too trusting.
[13245.44 → 13257.16] So I rely on processes and managers and HR to kind of monitor people's work and make sure that they're doing the right things in general.
[13257.26 → 13258.82] I think we have a perfect crew here.
[13260.18 → 13262.52] Like the app Mark Pippin is missing.
[13262.92 → 13263.42] Yeah.
[13263.98 → 13267.62] But it never occurred to me that someone would have stolen it.
[13267.62 → 13271.74] It's probably a like mishap thing.
[13271.94 → 13274.16] The box was ancient and ratty.
[13275.26 → 13278.34] I think it was probably just a really unfortunate accident.
[13278.70 → 13278.84] Yeah.
[13279.24 → 13281.94] Are you going to be doing latency timing for different controllers?
[13283.84 → 13284.20] Yeah.
[13286.14 → 13288.58] It might be kind of challenging for certain.
[13290.36 → 13292.42] We're certainly going to try.
[13292.42 → 13292.92] Something we'll consider.
[13293.30 → 13293.58] Yeah.
[13293.58 → 13297.28] Do you have any plans on labs testing screen protectors?
[13298.18 → 13298.32] Hmm.
[13298.94 → 13300.68] No, there are no plans for that right now.
[13300.76 → 13309.46] I think that would, in order to draw meaningful conclusions, you would have to have sample sizes far greater than what would be practical for us to test.
[13309.46 → 13314.58] Are you guys going to be looking at the new Acer 3D screen?
[13314.70 → 13317.86] They're using AI magic to turn 2D content into 3D.
[13317.86 → 13328.42] The new 3D screens that I've seen that are like 4K OLED, every other, actually, no, there are ones that aren't OLED too.
[13328.54 → 13332.96] Anyway, the new glasses list 3D that I've seen is kind of unbelievable.
[13332.96 → 13341.00] It uses camera eye tracking to know which eye is looking at it from where, and then it's like some kind of shift thing.
[13341.06 → 13343.82] Anyway, the point is it can account for where you're sitting.
[13344.36 → 13346.84] It's kind of mind-blowing, and it's pretty cool.
[13346.84 → 13349.44] Have you travelled with your Steam Deck?
[13349.52 → 13354.32] If so, do you have a go-to mobile charging solution or other accessories that you can stuff in his backpack?
[13354.76 → 13356.28] Oh, I just purchased.
[13356.28 → 13363.66] Yeah, I just carry one Type-C charger, the one for my laptop, and then I use it for my phone, my INTO.
[13364.06 → 13368.76] Actually, I've been using the Ally lately, but yeah, so for my Ally and for my laptop, it's freaking awesome.
[13369.42 → 13370.20] It's nothing special.
[13370.28 → 13373.94] It's just the one that came with my old Flow X13 laptop.
[13374.46 → 13377.08] I'm not that picky when it comes to chargers.
[13377.72 → 13381.78] Any plans for polo shirts for those of us nerds who need to wear polos at work?
[13382.76 → 13384.58] Also, restock on tablet when?
[13384.58 → 13388.36] We have some really exciting work wear coming.
[13388.82 → 13394.50] We have what we're calling tech pants, where they're really comfortable, and they have pockets and stuff,
[13394.60 → 13398.58] but they still look professional enough that you could wear them at a workplace that requires slacks.
[13399.32 → 13408.42] And then we also just have some just kind of basic, very minimal or invisible branding tops that are going to be very work-appropriate.
[13408.68 → 13409.32] I'm going to interject.
[13409.48 → 13411.16] I just want to answer this one vocally.
[13411.16 → 13417.96] Ryan N says, what do you think about companies that block ChatGPT for fear of leaking proprietary information?
[13418.36 → 13420.08] What would you suggest easing their fears?
[13421.18 → 13423.20] I cannot ease their fears.
[13423.38 → 13424.04] I don't know where it went.
[13424.12 → 13424.92] I can't hide it.
[13424.96 → 13426.08] If you guys see that one, hide it.
[13426.96 → 13428.26] I cannot ease their fears.
[13428.40 → 13431.24] This is a problem that I've been mentioning for a while.
[13431.52 → 13435.48] The chat or OpenAI is super transparent about the fact that they're reading all the responses,
[13435.48 → 13440.84] and they've already had a leak of information, this is something that people should not really be doing.
[13441.02 → 13445.14] It's up to your company to decide your security policies.
[13445.46 → 13449.96] If you put all this proprietary information on something like Google Docs, for instance,
[13450.12 → 13454.44] you're sharing it to a certain degree with Google, and there are security implications with that.
[13455.82 → 13458.28] Does that mean you would trust OpenAI?
[13458.28 → 13460.08] That's a decision that you have to make.
[13461.00 → 13465.16] But I do believe, as we've mentioned a couple of times and even talked about on today's show,
[13465.34 → 13475.44] that certain companies with certain levels of data security are going to run local offline versions of these things because of those things.
[13475.48 → 13477.68] So it's not an unfounded fear.
[13477.96 → 13479.04] So I can't dismiss it.
[13479.34 → 13479.78] But yeah.
[13480.36 → 13481.88] Oh, this is such a good one.
[13481.88 → 13483.48] Sebastian L asks,
[13483.58 → 13484.34] Hi, Linus and Luke.
[13484.54 → 13489.38] I'm a store manager and an Apple premium reseller and would like to hear how you would sell Apple products or the brand,
[13489.54 → 13490.70] knowing everything you do.
[13492.86 → 13493.74] Ease of use.
[13494.18 → 13494.96] Build quality.
[13495.30 → 13496.46] Isn't that easy to use?
[13496.78 → 13500.56] My mom spent years with Android phones and never really got it.
[13500.66 → 13504.82] Within a week of having an iPhone, it completely clicked, and she totally understood everything, and it worked fine.
[13505.52 → 13507.16] That, man, I don't know.
[13507.16 → 13509.18] I have not had the same experience.
[13509.26 → 13509.80] Yeah, me neither.
[13509.80 → 13511.38] But for some people, it's a thing.
[13512.30 → 13516.78] I probably would sell the benefit of, I mean, particularly the iPhone.
[13516.94 → 13521.66] I don't really think I could sell a Mac very easily, but the iPhone is a pretty obvious one to me.
[13522.20 → 13523.62] You just kind of don't have to think about it.
[13523.74 → 13527.14] It'll work for like six or seven years, and then you can get a new one.
[13527.26 → 13528.36] I would sell the longevity.
[13531.94 → 13535.12] Oh, I think you already did this block ChatGPT thing.
[13535.70 → 13538.72] Luke, you are a genuine role model, says Franklin.
[13538.72 → 13540.46] I was just trying to answer this through text, and I didn't want to.
[13540.46 → 13546.40] I teach classes to help incoming cable technicians learn to install network infrastructure.
[13546.96 → 13547.68] What would it be?
[13547.98 → 13552.20] What would it like to see in their installers?
[13552.20 → 13555.54] What would IT like to see in their installers to help make things easier?
[13558.36 → 13560.06] It's a really broad question.
[13560.36 → 13563.90] How I was going to answer it is just like a drive and willingness to learn new things,
[13563.90 → 13568.80] because it's an area that is like pretty much your whole job is maintaining what you have
[13568.80 → 13572.52] and also moving it forward with the constant march of technology.
[13572.52 → 13578.54] If you have someone who's not that interested in learning new things in that position, in my opinion,
[13578.82 → 13583.10] unless they're in a space that doesn't evolve, they're not going to do well.
[13583.52 → 13585.64] You like constantly have to use new stuff.
[13586.00 → 13589.52] So I know that's not something you can teach them necessarily, but it's a thing.
[13590.34 → 13592.64] I do not have a 10-year vision, Charles.
[13593.22 → 13593.74] Dang it.
[13593.74 → 13594.56] We're going to try.
[13594.88 → 13597.06] We're going to try to still exist in 10 years.
[13597.24 → 13597.90] That's the vision.
[13598.08 → 13598.26] Yeah.
[13598.40 → 13598.66] Still exist.
[13600.60 → 13604.88] Noah says, my friend and I are really excited about the future of QD OLED.
[13605.28 → 13608.20] We want to know how common you think the tech will be in the average user's monitor.
[13608.70 → 13612.60] I don't know if it'll be QD OLED, or it'll be future technology.
[13612.60 → 13620.10] I'd love to see microLED take over just because I hate the idea of manufacturing future e-waste, right?
[13620.26 → 13624.48] And OLED, even quantum.OLED, has a finite lifespan.
[13625.20 → 13628.40] And microLED looks like it extends that lifespan significantly.
[13628.58 → 13631.12] So I would like to see that take over.
[13632.66 → 13634.24] Question for you guys, Landon.
[13634.64 → 13639.96] What's a recent Jacky solution to a problem that was just too much effort to fix properly?
[13639.96 → 13650.04] I do this stuff so often that I don't even fully register everything anymore because it's just like how I operate.
[13650.14 → 13653.48] So I'm not actively thinking about like, this is the Jacky solution.
[13653.62 → 13655.76] It's just like, this is how I deal with problems.
[13656.86 → 13661.72] I couldn't get my webcam in the right spot on top of my monitor.
[13661.72 → 13674.08] So I just like took the cable and I, um, like I kind of like attached it to something so that the amount of weight was just enough that it wouldn't move at the spot that I need it.
[13674.32 → 13679.06] Instead of like doing it properly, it's just like kind of tied to another cable.
[13679.64 → 13682.34] So if that other cable ever moved, then it would move again.
[13682.44 → 13684.40] Like I didn't anchor it to anything real.
[13684.72 → 13685.50] So I did that today.
[13685.90 → 13686.16] Yeah.
[13686.26 → 13686.54] Nice.
[13686.98 → 13687.18] Yep.
[13687.30 → 13687.68] Oh yeah.
[13687.68 → 13690.16] That's not nothing big, but that's just how I live.
[13690.24 → 13698.10] Dealing with every single thing, like fully officially properly is just not, not very efficient and not necessary in my opinion.
[13700.18 → 13703.98] Um, no, I don't really recommend a ton of baby tech.
[13704.08 → 13707.72] Just like a baby monitor is nice to have, but don't go overboard.
[13707.84 → 13709.36] This is stuff you're only going to use.
[13709.36 → 13714.48] Like the infant stage is like six to nine months and then that's it.
[13714.52 → 13715.60] And then it's just e-waste.
[13715.74 → 13717.36] Like don't, don't overdo it.
[13717.56 → 13717.92] Jordan.
[13718.08 → 13720.62] I got, I got one that I want to answer verbally.
[13720.78 → 13726.90] Uh, Luke, I'm a BIOS engineer specializing in security on the motherboard that got hacked for complete security.
[13726.90 → 13728.82] It's best not to keep the board.
[13729.14 → 13731.86] Boot kits are becoming more, uh, oh, where'd it go?
[13732.32 → 13734.66] Boot kits are becoming more common, namely black Lotus.
[13734.66 → 13737.80] Ah, this is, this is the trouble.
[13737.98 → 13743.42] Like we, we had that short go out where we smashed the SSD and there were a bunch of responses being like, couldn't you have saved it?
[13743.92 → 13744.82] Wouldn't have been possible.
[13744.92 → 13746.02] It is possible.
[13746.02 → 13746.88] It would have been okay.
[13747.32 → 13748.26] Probably actually.
[13748.46 → 13748.72] Probably.
[13748.88 → 13749.74] Very probably.
[13749.94 → 13751.74] It's also technically possible.
[13751.84 → 13754.64] It wouldn't have, and it wasn't worth the risk.
[13755.26 → 13756.98] So we didn't do it.
[13757.12 → 13763.02] Uh, this is another situation where like now I'm getting a, a BIOS engineer telling me to throw it.
[13763.02 → 13767.24] Like the plan right now is to re-solder the chip, not to throw out the motherboard.
[13767.64 → 13769.90] I, I'm pretty certain that is fine.
[13770.22 → 13771.96] I do not believe we have to throw out the motherboard.
[13772.20 → 13775.68] I think if we completely replace the chip, it should be okay.
[13776.48 → 13778.96] Maybe I should, this makes me want to look into it a little bit more.
[13778.96 → 13780.60] I'm not aware of any other storage on a motherboard.
[13780.76 → 13781.14] Me neither.
[13781.30 → 13782.30] So like, it should be fine.
[13782.62 → 13785.80] Um, what I've been trying to figure out is, is flashing it fine?
[13787.10 → 13787.46] No.
[13788.00 → 13788.52] It's not?
[13788.64 → 13788.82] Nope.
[13789.20 → 13789.56] You're sure?
[13789.68 → 13789.82] Yep.
[13789.82 → 13790.50] Okay.
[13790.68 → 13793.74] Then yeah, I guess we're re-soldering the chip because I don't want to throw that board away.
[13793.98 → 13796.66] That's too much waste and completely replacing.
[13797.00 → 13797.24] Yeah.
[13797.30 → 13800.98] As far as I know, the only form of storage on the board, it should be fine.
[13801.14 → 13804.00] Like genuinely should be fine.
[13804.12 → 13805.14] As far as my understanding goes.
[13806.92 → 13809.58] I have never heard of shift phones.
[13810.08 → 13810.42] Me neither.
[13811.42 → 13812.58] Oh, they're headphones.
[13812.80 → 13814.36] That makes, oh no, there's also a phone.
[13814.36 → 13816.76] Um, okay.
[13817.54 → 13817.90] Yep.
[13818.08 → 13818.88] No idea.
[13819.08 → 13819.88] Never heard of it.
[13820.26 → 13821.84] Uh, neat.
[13823.06 → 13823.86] Thanks, Anonymous.
[13824.50 → 13825.24] Uh, Anthony.
[13825.64 → 13828.52] What resources, website, and online communities do you use to keep up with AI?
[13828.66 → 13830.96] I mean, honestly, it's just everywhere I look these days.
[13831.00 → 13832.48] I don't really have to go out of my way.
[13832.96 → 13833.32] Luke.
[13833.84 → 13835.30] It's just, you use Luke.
[13835.74 → 13836.06] Yeah.
[13836.70 → 13838.30] It is literally everywhere though.
[13838.42 → 13839.06] Like, I don't know.
[13839.60 → 13840.50] It's all over the place.
[13840.68 → 13841.60] Hey, thanks, Carrie.
[13841.60 → 13848.92] Um, uh, Rainier says, I could really use a way to redeem all these gift cards I've been
[13848.92 → 13850.78] collecting to store credit on my LTT account.
[13851.22 → 13851.58] Please?
[13852.12 → 13853.68] Well, you could buy something.
[13853.84 → 13854.22] That's a function.
[13854.42 → 13854.84] What do you mean?
[13855.28 → 13857.02] Um, Ashley.
[13857.16 → 13860.10] Huge fan of the WAN show and just wanted to say thanks for adding women's undergarments
[13860.10 → 13860.90] to the LTT store.
[13860.98 → 13863.02] My girlfriend and I have both been waiting to buy a pair.
[13863.14 → 13863.74] Heck yeah!
[13864.28 → 13864.60] Nice.
[13864.70 → 13868.96] I'm really excited about our next his and hers undergarment project.
[13868.96 → 13872.22] Okay, I'm just going to leak it.
[13872.80 → 13874.28] Matching strawberry print.
[13877.24 → 13879.12] The internet wants the gamer socks.
[13879.60 → 13880.98] Sorry, programming socks.
[13881.38 → 13881.92] Uh, Steven.
[13882.24 → 13882.44] Ah.
[13882.60 → 13884.26] Uh, my daughter and I love the show.
[13884.34 → 13885.42] We're in the UK and every side...
[13885.42 → 13885.76] Oh, okay.
[13885.80 → 13886.70] That would be just a show.
[13886.78 → 13886.92] Yep.
[13887.00 → 13887.20] Okay.
[13887.86 → 13888.18] Uh.
[13888.18 → 13892.34] Oh.
[13892.96 → 13895.36] Uh, all hail the LTT backpack, says Jonathan D.
[13895.46 → 13897.80] Late at night, a car pulled into my lane and immediately stopped.
[13897.88 → 13901.46] I had to brake hard and my backpack with the laptop went flying at my glove box.
[13901.68 → 13902.38] It survived.
[13904.14 → 13904.78] Heck yeah!
[13906.12 → 13908.28] A feature I'd love to see in merch messages, being able to...
[13908.28 → 13908.62] I was typing it up.
[13908.62 → 13909.14] Oh, okay.
[13909.30 → 13911.68] Just built my first PC with the LTT screwdriver.
[13911.88 → 13912.44] Heck yeah!
[13912.44 → 13915.74] What's the one thing you want to sell in LTT store but isn't practical in some way?
[13916.02 → 13916.60] The desk!
[13917.44 → 13921.34] We've designed these, like, super cool cable-less desks.
[13921.74 → 13922.36] And they're just...
[13922.36 → 13925.90] They're too big and impractical for us to figure out how to build and ship right now.
[13926.76 → 13927.44] Casey says...
[13927.44 → 13929.68] Greatly appreciate your videos and banter.
[13929.76 → 13932.40] Find myself disappointed in robot lawnmower technology.
[13932.94 → 13935.32] AI Vision Tech is somewhat here for this possible home video.
[13935.38 → 13936.46] We actually have one coming.
[13936.92 → 13939.02] We did a sponsored video with, um...
[13940.86 → 13941.54] Eco Flow.
[13942.38 → 13943.46] It's pretty cool.
[13943.56 → 13944.34] It's coming along.
[13944.72 → 13949.02] I wouldn't say it's, like, a no-brainer that everyone should just buy one by this...
[13949.02 → 13949.84] at this point in time.
[13949.92 → 13951.12] But it's definitely coming along.
[13952.34 → 13952.74] Um...
[13954.26 → 13957.22] Background playback is definitely something
[13957.22 → 13959.16] that we are working on, but it's going to take some time.
[13959.26 → 13959.60] Oh, wow.
[13959.68 → 13960.22] People are...
[13960.22 → 13961.26] People are moving things.
[13961.60 → 13962.28] Let's move them.
[13963.36 → 13963.64] Uh...
[13963.64 → 13964.88] Gianluca.
[13965.06 → 13965.70] Hi, I'm from Italy.
[13965.80 → 13968.14] What do you think about the fact that the privacy guarantor,
[13968.52 → 13971.62] a government entity, blocked access to ChatGPT?
[13971.76 → 13973.04] Oh, I did not see that.
[13973.50 → 13973.62] Uh...
[13973.62 → 13973.94] And I...
[13973.94 → 13976.16] So I don't have any thoughts on that, but that's kind of wild.
[13977.44 → 13980.34] Considering short runs of gear with custom brand instead of the LTT logo,
[13980.56 → 13982.52] if people were willing to pay a premium.
[13983.08 → 13986.16] I mean, Creator Warehouse exists in order for us to do that,
[13986.16 → 13987.68] so you would have to get in touch.
[13987.68 → 13989.78] And I think we have a site that we're going to launch
[13989.78 → 13992.18] that sort of talks about those services more in the future.
[13992.42 → 13994.68] But yeah, that's absolutely something we would do.
[13996.62 → 13997.50] MLA tech.
[13999.10 → 13999.58] Oh!
[14000.26 → 14001.06] You know what?
[14001.50 → 14004.24] The last gen of TVs was so good
[14004.24 → 14008.58] that I just have not really felt like I've needed to look that closely at the new gen.
[14008.58 → 14012.88] I think we have examples coming from Sony, Samsung, and LG for our roundup.
[14014.04 → 14018.94] But it doesn't seem to have been the huge leap forward that the previous gen was.
[14022.32 → 14022.68] Okay.
[14022.84 → 14025.92] And I think that is pretty much...
[14025.92 → 14026.66] Oh, no.
[14026.74 → 14027.28] This is interesting.
[14027.40 → 14027.96] Okay, last one.
[14028.36 → 14029.72] Garden says...
[14029.72 → 14031.44] Managed to catch a live show.
[14031.54 → 14031.80] Whoop!
[14032.12 → 14032.76] You have a wealth...
[14032.76 → 14032.84] No.
[14032.92 → 14033.08] Okay.
[14033.18 → 14033.34] Yep.
[14033.38 → 14037.64] Have you ever considered seed funding or mentoring smaller tech space creators?
[14037.64 → 14041.22] I don't know.
[14041.36 → 14042.58] What would that even look like?
[14042.84 → 14045.64] Like, I don't want to make them like...
[14048.56 → 14052.92] What's a word?
[14053.00 → 14055.98] Like, I don't want them to feel like they owe us something, right?
[14056.38 → 14057.64] Like, we've definitely...
[14058.72 → 14062.26] We've got LTX coming up where it's a chance for people to kind of get together
[14062.26 → 14063.28] and collab and network.
[14063.44 → 14065.36] That's something, I guess, we're doing.
[14065.36 → 14070.38] We're paying airfare and hotel for a lot of creators to come and kind of meet up.
[14070.48 → 14071.70] Obviously, there's a benefit to us.
[14071.74 → 14073.78] It makes our event cooler for the community as well.
[14073.88 → 14074.36] But, like...
[14075.24 → 14076.22] I don't know.
[14076.34 → 14078.54] I think the best thing we can do is just be an open book.
[14078.66 → 14081.22] Like, I got a lot of feedback that our videos about how we make money
[14081.22 → 14082.76] have really helped guide smaller creators.
[14084.28 → 14084.48] Yeah.
[14084.48 → 14085.48] There's a...
[14085.48 → 14086.48] There's a...
[14086.48 → 14091.64] I'm still kind of learning, like, 100% what it is.
[14092.10 → 14099.36] But there's a student-run thing for Harvard and MIT students called Prod.
[14100.96 → 14107.26] It's a student-run nonprofit that's, like, somewhat of a startup incubator
[14107.26 → 14109.08] for MIT and Harvard students.
[14109.08 → 14109.46] Mm-hmm.
[14109.82 → 14112.88] And I'm helping to do mentor stuff with them.
[14115.16 → 14116.00] So, yes.
