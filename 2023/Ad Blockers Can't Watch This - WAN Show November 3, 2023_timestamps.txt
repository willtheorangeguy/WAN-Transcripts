Google is actively exposing us to criminals for some questionable short term financial benefits. Obviously people that use an adblocker in the first place will be disgusted by ads and won't be a good target audience thus being worthless for the advertisers in the first place, so this doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

Signal's campaign "The Instagram ads Facebook won't show you" showed how advertisers profile us and that is just the tip of the iceberg, 100% guaranteed by now they have a LOT more detailed, even unique personality profiles regarding health, sexual / political preferences, religious beliefs, and whatever you can think of.
This is the ad industry Linus protects with that 'adblock is privacy' crap.

If I go to the grocery store they don't want to move in my house and use my car for my purchase, they just want money. Just make the damn site paid.

p.s. i will sooner not watch youtube with a logged in account than allow malware to run on _my_ computer; just as I will not allow [random stranger in the house either if I don't want to. I watched less than 10 minutes of this stream, a bit of 2 blocks, thanks to the timestamps. I am just clicking away when Linus says google buys hard drives at the same price as I do :D:D:D
