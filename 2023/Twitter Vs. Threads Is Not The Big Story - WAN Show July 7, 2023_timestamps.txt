I have come 3 times today to check out timestamps. But there is none. on the last WAN show i already said this is extremely outrageous that ltt relies on free work to do this. They can pay someone minimum wage to do this. But they won't as they are way to greedy. Now the timestamp guy is sick or busy and we don't have any timestamps. Without timestamps most people would never watch this show as its way to long.
